1
00:00:06,380 --> 00:00:08,470
There aren't that many
big studios like this nowadays.

2
00:00:08,470 --> 00:00:09,910
This place is nice.

3
00:00:10,040 --> 00:00:11,480
- This place is like...
- This is a nice place.

4
00:00:11,780 --> 00:00:15,120
Wait, this studio is Jong Kook's?

5
00:00:15,290 --> 00:00:16,550
- What?
- Your outfit today...

6
00:00:16,550 --> 00:00:17,810
What's up with your outfit today?

7
00:00:17,810 --> 00:00:20,190
I heard that today's episode
will be quite emotional.

8
00:00:20,190 --> 00:00:21,650
(I heard that today's episode
will be quite emotional.)

9
00:00:22,050 --> 00:00:23,360
- You know what?
- What are you talking about?

10
00:00:23,360 --> 00:00:25,120
- His outfit isn't touching at all.
- What are you saying?

11
00:00:25,120 --> 00:00:26,960
- I mean...
- I can see his nipples from here.

12
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:29,160
- No way. I'm facing forward.
- Hey!

13
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:30,660
- I'm facing forward.
- Jong Kook.

14
00:00:30,660 --> 00:00:33,460
My eyes keep looking down.

15
00:00:33,460 --> 00:00:36,210
I know that I'll see them from here,
but I can't stop looking at them.

16
00:00:36,370 --> 00:00:38,470
- I can see your pelvis through it.
- No.

17
00:00:38,500 --> 00:00:40,610
Gosh, Korea isn't there yet, right?

18
00:00:40,610 --> 00:00:41,810
(What's wrong
with a sleeveless shirt?)

19
00:00:41,810 --> 00:00:45,420
(Jong Kook exposes his side
too early in the times.)

20
00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:47,250
- We have a long way to go.
- Hey.

21
00:00:47,320 --> 00:00:49,680
Now, we just need
to give you the gong.

22
00:00:49,790 --> 00:00:51,180
- Is he the Gong Man?
- Gong Man?

23
00:00:51,180 --> 00:00:52,320
(He will follow in
Mickey Kwang Soo's footstep.)

24
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:53,580
Do you want to be a gong today?

25
00:00:53,860 --> 00:00:55,390
That's the songwriter, Jung Joon Il.

26
00:00:56,530 --> 00:00:58,130
- Gong Man?
- Do you want to be a gong today?

27
00:00:58,390 --> 00:00:59,720
That's the songwriter, Jung Joon Il.

28
00:00:59,720 --> 00:01:00,820
(He's here.)

29
00:01:01,290 --> 00:01:03,740
- Hello.
- We're meeting at last.

30
00:01:03,930 --> 00:01:05,670
- We're meeting at last.
- My gosh.

31
00:01:06,310 --> 00:01:08,140
- This way, please.
- Come this way.

32
00:01:08,140 --> 00:01:09,880
- That's the keyboard.
- My gosh.

33
00:01:09,880 --> 00:01:10,970
(Looking modest)

34
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,640
- This is amazing.
- I can see that you're shy.

35
00:01:13,770 --> 00:01:15,850
- He's very shy.
- He's shy around people.

36
00:01:15,850 --> 00:01:17,020
(Right now, he seems very shy.)

37
00:01:17,410 --> 00:01:20,490
(But this singer-songwriter
established his own style...)

38
00:01:20,490 --> 00:01:23,820
(with "Hug Me",
"Confession", and "To You".)

39
00:01:23,820 --> 00:01:27,160
(He wrote "Good for You"
and "First Snow" for "Goblin".)

40
00:01:27,160 --> 00:01:30,390
(He's a beloved musician
with popular songs.)

41
00:01:30,390 --> 00:01:35,070
(And he will write the theme song
for Running Man.)

42
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:38,490
I write songs...

43
00:01:38,490 --> 00:01:40,360
and sing those songs.
I'm Jung Joon Il.

44
00:01:40,360 --> 00:01:41,540
This is the songwriter,
Jung Joon Il.

45
00:01:41,540 --> 00:01:43,080
(They feel reassured
as Joon Il joins them.)

46
00:01:43,080 --> 00:01:44,710
<i>- Stay by my side</i>
- We're lucky to meet...

47
00:01:44,710 --> 00:01:45,740
a famous musician like him.

48
00:01:45,830 --> 00:01:47,180
So far, he's only been on...

49
00:01:47,500 --> 00:01:48,740
"Yu Huiyeol’s Sketchbook".

50
00:01:49,240 --> 00:01:50,550
He's only been on that show.

51
00:01:50,610 --> 00:01:51,720
Is this your first variety show?

52
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:53,940
Yes.

53
00:01:53,940 --> 00:01:56,490
(His throat is dry.
Clearing his throat)

54
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:58,820
- Your throat is too dry.
- Give him a glass of water.

55
00:01:59,460 --> 00:02:01,380
I can tell that you're shy.

56
00:02:01,380 --> 00:02:02,430
(He wets his throat and gets ready.)

57
00:02:02,430 --> 00:02:05,190
When the staff asked you
to join us for this project,

58
00:02:05,690 --> 00:02:07,830
- you were in New York.
- Yes.

59
00:02:08,130 --> 00:02:10,630
- Really?
- I was there for less than a month.

60
00:02:10,740 --> 00:02:12,070
You're living a great life.

61
00:02:12,100 --> 00:02:13,270
He must speak English well.

62
00:02:13,270 --> 00:02:15,410
Usually, people who speak English
stay there for a month or so.

63
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:17,570
- No, that's not true.
- You don't speak English?

64
00:02:17,570 --> 00:02:19,750
- He must've been in Koreatown.
- Koreatown.

65
00:02:19,750 --> 00:02:20,850
Well, if he stayed there...

66
00:02:21,380 --> 00:02:24,220
- You'd be fine on the 32nd street.
- He's an expert.

67
00:02:24,220 --> 00:02:26,440
- They have Caffe Bene and all.
- Right.

68
00:02:26,440 --> 00:02:28,380
(That's a Korean cafe.)

69
00:02:28,380 --> 00:02:30,450
- He's the US expert.
- "Caffe Bene"?

70
00:02:30,450 --> 00:02:32,090
- Right.
- Exactly.

71
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:33,690
He's the US expert.

72
00:02:33,690 --> 00:02:35,250
- You're keeping your manners.
- What do you mean?

73
00:02:35,290 --> 00:02:36,790
- You're covering your sides.
- What?

74
00:02:36,850 --> 00:02:37,920
It's because...

75
00:02:38,820 --> 00:02:41,100
when I'm talking about something,

76
00:02:41,130 --> 00:02:43,160
they'll put up a close-up shot
of me.

77
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:45,160
- You're well-mannered.
- Of course.

78
00:02:45,160 --> 00:02:46,410
I like that side about him.

79
00:02:46,470 --> 00:02:48,130
- He's polite for a muscular guy.
- Of course.

80
00:02:48,130 --> 00:02:50,410
- "He's polite for a muscular guy."
- He is.

81
00:02:50,410 --> 00:02:52,840
- He's well-mannered.
- Muscular Gentleman.

82
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:56,280
- So you got our call in New York.
- Yes.

83
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:58,650
Did you say yes without
giving it some thought first?

84
00:02:59,010 --> 00:03:01,690
Yes, I'm a fan of the show.

85
00:03:01,690 --> 00:03:02,820
(Joon Il is a big fan
of Running Man.)

86
00:03:02,820 --> 00:03:05,060
- Do you find our show...
- He's calm.

87
00:03:05,060 --> 00:03:06,190
entertaining?

88
00:03:06,190 --> 00:03:08,320
Do you laugh
while watching the show?

89
00:03:08,950 --> 00:03:10,100
Yes.

90
00:03:11,160 --> 00:03:14,070
(Trailing off)

91
00:03:14,070 --> 00:03:17,070
(They've never heard anyone
say yes this unenthusiastically.)

92
00:03:17,070 --> 00:03:18,290
We're so childish.

93
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:21,410
(Laughing)

94
00:03:21,410 --> 00:03:22,470
- Jong Kook.
- What are you saying?

95
00:03:22,470 --> 00:03:23,880
- What?
- Okay.

96
00:03:24,310 --> 00:03:26,470
- We're not that childish.
- Look at them.

97
00:03:26,670 --> 00:03:28,570
Look at them. Look.

98
00:03:28,970 --> 00:03:32,070
(It's too embarrassing to show
these kids' sense of humor.)

99
00:03:32,070 --> 00:03:35,090
(We must adjust the show
to a G-rated show.)

100
00:03:35,090 --> 00:03:36,660
(An outdated gesture)

101
00:03:36,660 --> 00:03:39,160
(Unexpectedly,
this is right up his alley.)

102
00:03:39,160 --> 00:03:40,350
Goodness.

103
00:03:40,420 --> 00:03:42,530
- He's liking it.
- He's liking it a lot.

104
00:03:42,690 --> 00:03:44,130
He likes this kind of stuff.

105
00:03:44,130 --> 00:03:45,450
Joon Il is liking this.

106
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:47,190
(Coughing)

107
00:03:47,190 --> 00:03:48,470
Joon Il is liking this.

108
00:03:48,690 --> 00:03:49,900
(He chokes up for the 2nd time.)

109
00:03:49,900 --> 00:03:51,100
He's dying.

110
00:03:51,230 --> 00:03:52,340
- Are you all right?
- He's dying.

111
00:03:52,340 --> 00:03:54,260
(He's dying from laughing too hard.)

112
00:03:54,260 --> 00:03:56,810
- This feels great.
- In old movies,

113
00:03:56,880 --> 00:04:00,540
- songwriters die like this.
- He's dying.

114
00:04:00,810 --> 00:04:02,780
(He really must be our fan.)

115
00:04:02,780 --> 00:04:04,880
He wants to divide up the parts.

116
00:04:04,970 --> 00:04:06,690
He'd like to know
everyone's vocal range.

117
00:04:06,690 --> 00:04:09,440
My throat isn't ready
in the morning. Goodness.

118
00:04:09,440 --> 00:04:10,660
Which song should we sing?

119
00:04:10,790 --> 00:04:12,620
- Let's go with "I Miss You".
- "I Miss You".

120
00:04:12,750 --> 00:04:13,790
Kim Bum Soo's song?

121
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:15,880
Should I lower the key?

122
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:17,820
- No, I'll sing in the original key.
- We must sing in the original key.

123
00:04:17,820 --> 00:04:19,320
- We don't lower keys.
- Right.

124
00:04:19,690 --> 00:04:21,130
- We don't roll like that.
- That's our weakness.

125
00:04:21,130 --> 00:04:22,470
- We don't lower the key.
- We...

126
00:04:22,470 --> 00:04:24,140
- We'll go with the original key.
- We never lower the key.

127
00:04:24,140 --> 00:04:25,360
- Shall we start?
- Ji Hyo will start.

128
00:04:27,340 --> 00:04:28,710
You'll start now, Ji Hyo.

129
00:04:28,710 --> 00:04:30,780
(Ji Hyo is known
to be a bad singer.)

130
00:04:30,780 --> 00:04:33,650
(Her pitch is unstable
from the start.)

131
00:04:33,650 --> 00:04:34,780
Don't laugh.

132
00:04:34,780 --> 00:04:36,610
(Her pitch shakes
like a swaying tree.)

133
00:04:36,610 --> 00:04:38,170
(Staring)

134
00:04:38,170 --> 00:04:40,040
(Chuckling)

135
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:41,180
Song Ji Hyo is out.

136
00:04:41,180 --> 00:04:43,550
(Song Ji Hyo is out.)

137
00:04:43,550 --> 00:04:47,350
(Ji Hyo might be eliminated
from singing the theme song.)

138
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:51,160
Hey, why do you keep laughing?

139
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:54,120
How can I sing when you're laughing
right in front of me?

140
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:55,360
- Don't make her feel insecure.
- Hey.

141
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:56,730
- Don't do that.
- Anyway,

142
00:04:56,730 --> 00:04:57,840
you're on the show
to make people laugh.

143
00:04:57,840 --> 00:04:58,970
- Wait, no.
- So it's all good now.

144
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:01,770
- It's okay.
- Are you doing that on purpose?

145
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:03,230
- Next up is...
- This is...

146
00:05:03,230 --> 00:05:04,540
Actually, this is
Kwang Soo's favorite song.

147
00:05:04,540 --> 00:05:05,970
- He always sings this song.
- This is...

148
00:05:05,970 --> 00:05:07,370
- Kwang Soo's song.
- He sang it at a fan-meet too.

149
00:05:07,370 --> 00:05:08,510
- Really?
- Yes.

150
00:05:08,710 --> 00:05:11,650
1, 2, 3.

151
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:15,040
(The memories)

152
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:18,180
(When I was madly in love)

153
00:05:18,180 --> 00:05:19,410
He can reach the high notes.

154
00:05:19,410 --> 00:05:20,590
(He's pretty good.)

155
00:05:21,030 --> 00:05:26,160
(I won't use our love
as an excuse anymore)

156
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:27,600
- He's pretty good.
- He's...

157
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:29,420
He's good.

158
00:05:29,420 --> 00:05:31,790
(Unexpectedly, he can pull off
those high notes pretty well.)

159
00:05:31,790 --> 00:05:32,900
That was nice.

160
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:36,060
Your pitch was stable.

161
00:05:36,410 --> 00:05:37,840
He seems satisfied.

162
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:39,410
(Even Joon Il is clapping for him.)

163
00:05:39,410 --> 00:05:40,580
His singing method is known as...

164
00:05:40,580 --> 00:05:42,010
the Eunuch Method.

165
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:43,470
- What's that?
- That's how they sing.

166
00:05:43,610 --> 00:05:46,350
<i>I can't stop you</i>

167
00:05:46,350 --> 00:05:47,680
Your Majesty.

168
00:05:48,950 --> 00:05:50,020
Come on.

169
00:05:50,090 --> 00:05:52,520
- Jae Suk.
- What are you talking about?

170
00:05:52,520 --> 00:05:53,980
- Your Majesty.
- What?

171
00:05:53,980 --> 00:05:55,890
- I didn't sing like that.
- You did.

172
00:05:55,980 --> 00:05:57,960
- "Your Majesty"?
- I sounded like him.

173
00:05:57,960 --> 00:06:01,220
- Why would you say that?
- That's the Eunuch Method.

174
00:06:01,220 --> 00:06:03,540
- He's the loyal eunuch.
- Right. He's loyal.

175
00:06:03,540 --> 00:06:04,600
- Why am I a loyal eunuch?
- You are one.

176
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:06,600
This is funny. It's so funny.

177
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:08,270
I'll sing this time.

178
00:06:08,540 --> 00:06:09,870
Jae Suk.

179
00:06:10,510 --> 00:06:12,140
- He's a hidden master.
- Right.

180
00:06:12,580 --> 00:06:13,800
I'll follow your lead.

181
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:16,520
- No, I'll follow your lead.
- I see.

182
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:19,020
- Don't follow my lead.
- Who will follow whose lead?

183
00:06:19,020 --> 00:06:20,410
What if both of them can't lead?

184
00:06:20,610 --> 00:06:22,040
At this rate, no one can lead.

185
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:23,310
- Why not?
- You must lead at least.

186
00:06:23,310 --> 00:06:24,550
- Someone has to lead.
- I can follow his lead.

187
00:06:24,550 --> 00:06:27,180
- Someone has to lead.
- Okay, okay. I'll take the lead.

188
00:06:27,180 --> 00:06:28,720
- Follow my lead.
- Okay.

189
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:29,900
- Here I go.
- They are giving it a go.

190
00:06:31,960 --> 00:06:34,030
<i>- The</i>
- Hold on.

191
00:06:35,060 --> 00:06:37,290
(Singing the first note)

192
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:39,860
- Hey.
- You're not singing a trot song.

193
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:42,230
(No one can keep up
with this master.)

194
00:06:42,230 --> 00:06:43,600
- This song doesn't suit me.
- Are you singing "Chang"?

195
00:06:43,710 --> 00:06:45,140
This song doesn't suit me.

196
00:06:45,140 --> 00:06:46,300
He changed the notes.

197
00:06:46,300 --> 00:06:48,470
- The song doesn't suit me.
- He changed the notes.

198
00:06:48,670 --> 00:06:49,780
I'll start.

199
00:06:49,780 --> 00:06:52,740
(He gives it another try.)

200
00:06:57,890 --> 00:06:59,890
- He sang with a technique.
- He has a good vibe.

201
00:06:59,890 --> 00:07:01,790
<i>I shouldn't</i>

202
00:07:01,790 --> 00:07:05,830
(I'm not done yet.
I must sing the whole song.)

203
00:07:05,830 --> 00:07:06,970
This is an important part.

204
00:07:07,490 --> 00:07:10,360
(I miss you)

205
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:12,900
(Like crazy)

206
00:07:14,510 --> 00:07:17,670
(He's in his own world.)

207
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:19,600
What's wrong?
Are you having sleep paralysis?

208
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:22,600
(Are you all right?)

209
00:07:23,650 --> 00:07:25,310
- Hey!
- Wake up. Are you all right?

210
00:07:25,310 --> 00:07:26,350
I was...

211
00:07:26,350 --> 00:07:28,650
- I had to wake him up.
- How...

212
00:07:28,650 --> 00:07:30,390
How could you say that?

213
00:07:30,520 --> 00:07:33,160
Come on, I was reaching the climax.

214
00:07:33,980 --> 00:07:35,330
He wasn't that bad.

215
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:39,620
All right. I ought to show you
how a singer sings.

216
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:41,860
(He's talking big again.)

217
00:07:44,640 --> 00:07:47,410
(He already finds it funny.)

218
00:07:48,710 --> 00:07:51,140
(The memories)

219
00:07:53,850 --> 00:07:56,810
(He adjust the notes himself.)

220
00:07:56,810 --> 00:07:58,910
He can't reach the high notes.
He can't.

221
00:07:59,470 --> 00:08:00,720
He started off high.

222
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:02,650
(He's about to pass out
from laughing.)

223
00:08:02,650 --> 00:08:03,680
Is that right?

224
00:08:05,050 --> 00:08:06,350
Great.

225
00:08:06,350 --> 00:08:10,260
(This time, he sings
the high notes nicely.)

226
00:08:10,260 --> 00:08:13,200
(As an excuse)

227
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:16,560
(He only mouths the parts
with high notes that he can't hit.)

228
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:18,200
(The singer with 1 released album
can sing it however he wants.)

229
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:19,470
He's definitely in control.

230
00:08:19,470 --> 00:08:20,800
(The singer with 1 released album
can sing it however he wants.)

231
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:22,100
He's different.

232
00:08:22,730 --> 00:08:24,080
- He's playing hard-to-get with us.
- Great.

233
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:25,730
How was it?

234
00:08:26,100 --> 00:08:28,280
You were playing with the tempo.

235
00:08:28,710 --> 00:08:30,020
That's an old style of singing.

236
00:08:33,850 --> 00:08:35,890
You were playing with the tempo.

237
00:08:35,950 --> 00:08:37,110
That's an old style of singing.

238
00:08:37,110 --> 00:08:39,860
(That's his evaluation in one line.)

239
00:08:39,860 --> 00:08:41,160
Didn't I tell you?
I told you he has an old style.

240
00:08:41,860 --> 00:08:43,230
I told you he has an old style.

241
00:08:45,290 --> 00:08:46,820
(Oldboy Suk Jin)

242
00:08:46,820 --> 00:08:47,920
His style is so outdated.

243
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:49,230
I was going to bring that up.

244
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:51,770
- Se Chan.
- Okay.

245
00:08:52,270 --> 00:08:53,460
- He's a good singer.
- My gosh.

246
00:08:53,460 --> 00:08:55,770
But he sings songs
in an annoying manner.

247
00:08:55,770 --> 00:08:58,640
- He sounds like an annoying guy.
- That's true.

248
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:01,040
- He does sing like an annoying guy.
- That's right.

249
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:02,510
What's the first note?

250
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:05,170
<i>- The</i>
- That's wrong.

251
00:09:05,780 --> 00:09:07,290
That's the wrong note. It's wrong.

252
00:09:08,120 --> 00:09:09,290
- It's wrong.
- It's totally off.

253
00:09:09,290 --> 00:09:11,080
- You were totally off.
<i>- The memories</i>

254
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:12,990
(He barely manages
to get the first note right.)

255
00:09:12,990 --> 00:09:14,390
- Okay, I'm ready.
- You're ready.

256
00:09:15,550 --> 00:09:16,630
You're relaxed.

257
00:09:16,950 --> 00:09:18,630
(The memories)

258
00:09:18,630 --> 00:09:19,760
See? He's so annoying.

259
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:21,920
Look at his eyes. His eyes.

260
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:23,790
(His annoying gaze
is bothering them.)

261
00:09:23,790 --> 00:09:26,060
- He's so annoying.
- I told you he gets annoying.

262
00:09:26,060 --> 00:09:28,660
Seriously.
He sings like that all the time.

263
00:09:28,660 --> 00:09:30,240
(That's how he looks at a karaoke.)

264
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:31,780
(Although he's annoying,
his high notes are perfect.)

265
00:09:31,780 --> 00:09:32,930
- Gosh.
- He sang all of the high notes.

266
00:09:33,170 --> 00:09:34,840
He sang all the high notes easily.

267
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:37,940
(Se Chan's "I Miss You" is better
with your eyes closed.)

268
00:09:41,290 --> 00:09:43,490
- Your voice is going to get hoarse.
- He sang all of the high notes.

269
00:09:43,490 --> 00:09:44,990
- My gosh.
- It was pretty intense.

270
00:09:44,990 --> 00:09:46,660
- Now...
- It's Jong Kook.

271
00:09:46,760 --> 00:09:49,360
- He'll sing the female version.
- No, no.

272
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:51,190
He can't sing in the same key.

273
00:09:52,190 --> 00:09:53,370
I will raise the key by one.

274
00:09:54,900 --> 00:09:57,060
"I will raise the key by one."
This song is already high pitched.

275
00:09:57,330 --> 00:09:58,460
- This song has high notes.
- He sounds so cool.

276
00:09:58,790 --> 00:10:05,880
<i>The memories
when I was madly in love</i>

277
00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:07,150
He's at ease.

278
00:10:07,150 --> 00:10:11,250
(Jong Kook hits the high notes
without a problem.)

279
00:10:11,250 --> 00:10:15,410
<i>I'm looking for you</i>

280
00:10:15,750 --> 00:10:21,920
<i>I won't use our love
as an excuse anymore</i>

281
00:10:22,030 --> 00:10:24,260
<i>I can't keep you any longer</i>

282
00:10:24,260 --> 00:10:28,190
(He reveals his sweet voice
that he locked up in his muscles.)

283
00:10:28,190 --> 00:10:29,660
He's singing this so easily.

284
00:10:30,290 --> 00:10:34,640
(It's time to please our ears
with Jong Kook's mellow singing.)

285
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:37,170
<i>From the depth of my heart</i>

286
00:10:37,170 --> 00:10:41,840
<i>I miss you</i>

287
00:10:41,840 --> 00:10:44,440
<i>So much</i>

288
00:10:44,440 --> 00:10:46,150
(Screaming)

289
00:10:48,910 --> 00:10:50,390
(Haha lifts his arm.)

290
00:10:50,620 --> 00:10:52,160
(His armpit is in danger.)

291
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:53,530
Don't do that!

292
00:10:54,730 --> 00:10:56,130
He's the best singer among us!

293
00:10:56,820 --> 00:10:58,190
You reassure us.

294
00:10:58,360 --> 00:10:59,760
He even raised the key.

295
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:01,630
- It's still too early.
- Right, he did.

296
00:11:01,630 --> 00:11:03,560
- He sang so easily.
- It's still too early.

297
00:11:03,690 --> 00:11:05,060
We're not that bad, right?

298
00:11:05,060 --> 00:11:07,040
You're all... You're...

299
00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:09,270
You're...

300
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:11,980
(You're...)

301
00:11:11,980 --> 00:11:13,140
- We're what?
- Were we bad?

302
00:11:13,140 --> 00:11:14,440
(They can't believe it.)

303
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:15,610
- You're...
- Were we bad?

304
00:11:15,610 --> 00:11:17,340
It was great.

305
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:21,540
(He forces himself
to compliment them.)

306
00:11:21,540 --> 00:11:24,520
I'm glad that
we all like each other.

307
00:11:24,860 --> 00:11:26,290
He likes us.

308
00:11:26,290 --> 00:11:28,230
- And we like him too.
- And we like him too.

309
00:11:28,230 --> 00:11:29,630
Right, it's great.

310
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:33,660
The reason why we're here
to see him is because...

311
00:11:33,660 --> 00:11:35,320
of our lyrics.

312
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:36,460
- Right.
- We had to write lyrics.

313
00:11:36,460 --> 00:11:38,000
- We played the game.
- You're right.

314
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,910
(During the theme song race,)

315
00:11:40,910 --> 00:11:44,070
(they decided to give each other
nicknames.)

316
00:11:44,070 --> 00:11:45,740
(Suk Jin called Ji Hyo Song Van.)

317
00:11:45,740 --> 00:11:48,410
(Her nickname was Song Van.)

318
00:11:48,410 --> 00:11:49,440
(Mouth Like Mount Baekdu)

319
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:51,170
(This was So Min's nickname
for Jae Suk.)

320
00:11:51,170 --> 00:11:53,380
(Their nicknames were made
out of endearment.)

321
00:11:53,380 --> 00:11:56,520
(Members' Nicknames)

322
00:11:56,950 --> 00:11:59,680
I received your nicknames
through email.

323
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:00,920
- How were they?
- How were they?

324
00:12:00,920 --> 00:12:02,860
(How were they?)

325
00:12:02,860 --> 00:12:04,450
I thought about dropping out.

326
00:12:04,450 --> 00:12:06,870
(He thought about dropping out.)

327
00:12:08,190 --> 00:12:09,660
I do understand.

328
00:12:09,660 --> 00:12:10,770
- Me too.
- Me too.

329
00:12:10,770 --> 00:12:12,190
It's difficult to use
those nicknames.

330
00:12:12,190 --> 00:12:13,800
- Right, it is.
- I understand.

331
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:16,200
I haven't written the lyrics yet,

332
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:18,430
so let me listen to you first.

333
00:12:18,510 --> 00:12:21,440
Could we listen to the chorus first?

334
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:23,670
I actually made the music...

335
00:12:23,670 --> 00:12:25,340
- beforehand.
- Did you?

336
00:12:25,340 --> 00:12:26,840
- Really?
- Yes.

337
00:12:26,840 --> 00:12:28,710
- I'm curious.
- Let's hear it.

338
00:12:28,710 --> 00:12:30,040
I'm curious.

339
00:12:30,290 --> 00:12:33,680
(The theme song will now
be revealed.)

340
00:12:36,450 --> 00:12:38,530
(This is Running Man's first
theme song...)

341
00:12:38,530 --> 00:12:42,160
(in 9 years.)

342
00:12:42,500 --> 00:12:45,770
(What kind of song will it be?)

343
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:48,410
- I like it already.
- It reminds me of "Aladdin".

344
00:12:48,410 --> 00:12:50,060
- It sounds adventurous.
- It sounds like Disneyland.

345
00:12:50,060 --> 00:12:52,070
- You're right.
- It sounds adventurous.

346
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:54,570
(The intro sounds like
a parade that will unfold...)

347
00:12:54,570 --> 00:12:56,340
(the story of Running Man
since the past 9 years.)

348
00:12:56,440 --> 00:12:58,280
- I love this.
- Crazy Poet.

349
00:12:58,280 --> 00:13:00,620
(Crazy Poet)

350
00:13:00,620 --> 00:13:02,210
(Really Foolish)

351
00:13:02,210 --> 00:13:04,620
(Jee Stream is flowing)

352
00:13:05,080 --> 00:13:09,320
(This is how their nicknames
will be added to the song.)

353
00:13:09,990 --> 00:13:12,690
(Be as Tall as 3m)

354
00:13:12,790 --> 00:13:15,560
(Give Me Some Money)

355
00:13:15,660 --> 00:13:17,790
(They become excited.)

356
00:13:17,900 --> 00:13:22,040
(The melody makes them dance.)

357
00:13:24,170 --> 00:13:26,540
I'd like you to rap here.

358
00:13:26,540 --> 00:13:28,170
- Haha?
- Yes.

359
00:13:28,340 --> 00:13:29,440
Okay.

360
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:32,670
For this part, either Ji Hyo
or So Min could sing.

361
00:13:32,670 --> 00:13:33,910
- What?
- What?

362
00:13:33,910 --> 00:13:35,490
- What?
- Have you heard Ji Hyo sing?

363
00:13:35,490 --> 00:13:36,620
She can't sing.

364
00:13:36,620 --> 00:13:38,080
- Come on.
- I don't think he knows.

365
00:13:38,080 --> 00:13:39,550
Have you heard her sing?

366
00:13:39,550 --> 00:13:41,030
(I got it.)

367
00:13:42,950 --> 00:13:44,320
This is nice.

368
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:47,730
(As the song progresses,
they like it even more.)

369
00:13:48,900 --> 00:13:50,240
(Humming)

370
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:52,790
I bet Suk Jin will cry here.

371
00:13:53,190 --> 00:13:55,010
(Crying)

372
00:13:55,560 --> 00:13:57,740
- I bet he will.
- Prepare your handkerchieves.

373
00:13:57,740 --> 00:13:59,140
So this is how it ends.

374
00:13:59,140 --> 00:14:00,170
(They plan to show
the 9-year journey.)

375
00:14:00,170 --> 00:14:01,250
(They get up...)

376
00:14:01,250 --> 00:14:03,780
(and applaud.)

377
00:14:03,780 --> 00:14:05,150
Bravo!

378
00:14:05,150 --> 00:14:06,540
(This will be
their first theme song.)

379
00:14:06,540 --> 00:14:09,520
- Hooray.
- Jong Kook, let's say hooray.

380
00:14:09,750 --> 00:14:11,210
Let's say hooray.

381
00:14:11,290 --> 00:14:14,030
- Hooray!
- Grab my hand and say hooray.

382
00:14:14,030 --> 00:14:15,160
Stop it.

383
00:14:15,230 --> 00:14:16,580
Let's try it once.

384
00:14:17,050 --> 00:14:18,230
- Just once.
- Come on.

385
00:14:18,230 --> 00:14:19,290
You're right.

386
00:14:19,290 --> 00:14:20,820
This is too unnatural.

387
00:14:20,820 --> 00:14:23,400
- Let's do it.
- It's too unnatural.

388
00:14:23,400 --> 00:14:25,060
- Show it to Joon Il.
- That was good.

389
00:14:26,660 --> 00:14:29,040
- It felt cozy and warm.
- It was cheerful.

390
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:31,800
By the way, it was really nice.
How was it, Ji Hyo?

391
00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:35,110
The song made me feel calm.

392
00:14:35,110 --> 00:14:36,300
- Right.
- I felt peace.

393
00:14:36,300 --> 00:14:37,440
There she goes lying again.

394
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:38,880
(She didn't mean it.)

395
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:41,410
(The members know
if she means something or not.)

396
00:14:41,410 --> 00:14:43,520
- What do you mean?
- Ji Hyo.

397
00:14:43,580 --> 00:14:45,860
Ji Hyo, think again.

398
00:14:45,860 --> 00:14:47,180
Okay.

399
00:14:47,950 --> 00:14:49,050
She acknowledged it.

400
00:14:49,050 --> 00:14:50,900
- That was quick.
- She quickly acknowledged it.

401
00:14:50,900 --> 00:14:52,690
- I did.
- I think highly of her.

402
00:14:52,690 --> 00:14:57,590
As for the pitch,
we could work with this.

403
00:14:57,590 --> 00:15:00,460
Do you have any ideas
about the lyrics?

404
00:15:00,460 --> 00:15:03,540
Or do you have anything to say
to each other?

405
00:15:03,540 --> 00:15:04,800
Like rolling paper?

406
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:06,430
(He doesn't understand.)

407
00:15:06,430 --> 00:15:08,440
- No, it's teasing paper.
- Teasing paper?

408
00:15:08,440 --> 00:15:09,980
So that's not it.

409
00:15:09,980 --> 00:15:11,570
We can write whatever we want.

410
00:15:11,570 --> 00:15:13,650
- Rolling paper...
- Write with emotions.

411
00:15:13,810 --> 00:15:16,340
I got some great lyrics here.

412
00:15:16,340 --> 00:15:17,390
What is it?

413
00:15:18,660 --> 00:15:21,080
"Just like how we didn't know
we'd meet,"

414
00:15:21,080 --> 00:15:22,760
"we'll never know when we'll part."

415
00:15:25,190 --> 00:15:28,030
(How does he feel?)

416
00:15:28,030 --> 00:15:30,330
"But for today, let's stay fresh."

417
00:15:30,330 --> 00:15:31,830
- Come on.
- How was it?

418
00:15:31,830 --> 00:15:33,000
- How was it?
- You had me at the start.

419
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,040
Isn't it good, Ji Hyo?

420
00:15:34,040 --> 00:15:35,160
It's amazing.

421
00:15:35,160 --> 00:15:36,800
- The first part was nice.
- It was great.

422
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:39,110
- It's like a diaper commercial.
- Right?

423
00:15:39,110 --> 00:15:42,480
Jee Stream could appear
while wearing a diaper.

424
00:15:42,670 --> 00:15:44,380
(He's fit to shoot this commercial.)

425
00:15:44,380 --> 00:15:45,670
This is great.

426
00:15:46,150 --> 00:15:48,310
No matter how exhausting,
struggling, and hard it was...

427
00:15:49,520 --> 00:15:51,180
- we were always...
- "I rested."

428
00:15:51,180 --> 00:15:53,450
(Suk Jin rested.)

429
00:15:53,550 --> 00:15:56,290
(Suk Jin only thinks
about himself.)

430
00:15:56,290 --> 00:15:59,050
"We were strong together,
but I was never with you."

431
00:15:59,050 --> 00:16:01,400
(Haha mimics him.)

432
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:04,240
"Everyone screamed and shouted,"

433
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:05,660
"but I lip-synced."

434
00:16:05,660 --> 00:16:07,160
(Jae Suk mimics him.)

435
00:16:07,160 --> 00:16:08,370
What do you say?

436
00:16:08,370 --> 00:16:09,870
- Isn't it nice?
- It is.

437
00:16:10,010 --> 00:16:12,070
Are we writing these lyrics for him?

438
00:16:12,110 --> 00:16:13,910
Is that it?

439
00:16:13,910 --> 00:16:15,340
(Subtitle: "Receiver, Suk Jin")

440
00:16:15,380 --> 00:16:18,040
Was there anything
you were curious about?

441
00:16:18,040 --> 00:16:19,120
Perhaps, our keywords.

442
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:21,440
For me, I was curious
about your beginnings.

443
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:23,340
- Our beginnings?
- I want to know how you felt...

444
00:16:23,340 --> 00:16:24,580
back then.

445
00:16:24,580 --> 00:16:26,050
- That's perfect.
- Our beginnings?

446
00:16:26,520 --> 00:16:28,230
"Suk Jin told me..."

447
00:16:28,860 --> 00:16:29,890
(What did he say?)

448
00:16:29,890 --> 00:16:31,400
"Suk Jin told me..."

449
00:16:31,400 --> 00:16:32,590
"that Haha..."

450
00:16:32,590 --> 00:16:37,270
(Suk Jin Told me that Haha...)

451
00:16:37,270 --> 00:16:38,930
"and Jong Kook were bullying him."

452
00:16:38,930 --> 00:16:42,460
(Haha and Jong Kook were
bullying him.)

453
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:46,200
(The 45-year-old remembers the days
when he was bullied.)

454
00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:48,280
- This was in the beginning.
- You're right.

455
00:16:48,280 --> 00:16:50,340
He told me this through the phone.

456
00:16:50,340 --> 00:16:52,650
"That's why I told the producer
three times..."

457
00:16:52,650 --> 00:16:54,040
"that I wanted to quit."

458
00:16:54,340 --> 00:16:55,520
Good.

459
00:16:55,520 --> 00:17:00,080
(Thankfully, no one quit,
and Running Man is still here.)

460
00:17:00,080 --> 00:17:01,920
- This is...
- I love the melody.

461
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:03,290
It sounds like Broadway.

462
00:17:03,290 --> 00:17:04,790
- It sounds like an amusement park.
- You're right.

463
00:17:04,790 --> 00:17:05,860
(He likes it.)

464
00:17:06,900 --> 00:17:08,590
(Once we finish filming today)

465
00:17:08,730 --> 00:17:10,500
Write it down, please.

466
00:17:10,670 --> 00:17:12,670
- Write it down.
- He looked pitiful.

467
00:17:12,670 --> 00:17:14,100
<i>- Even if we break up,</i>
- This song isn't...

468
00:17:14,100 --> 00:17:15,540
<i>- Let's meet</i>
- just for you.

469
00:17:15,630 --> 00:17:17,540
- Don't lie.
<i>- Let's meet</i>

470
00:17:17,630 --> 00:17:19,570
He wants to meet
even if we break up.

471
00:17:21,640 --> 00:17:24,680
(Until Kwang Soo's son
gets enlisted in the army)

472
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:29,450
(I want to live)

473
00:17:29,640 --> 00:17:31,880
Hey, I'm still young.

474
00:17:32,460 --> 00:17:34,550
I wonder if he'll still be alive.

475
00:17:34,820 --> 00:17:37,390
- Hey.
- He wonders.

476
00:17:37,390 --> 00:17:39,650
- This isn't working.
- Don't die!

477
00:17:39,650 --> 00:17:42,120
"Until Kwang Soo's son
gets enlisted in the army."

478
00:17:42,590 --> 00:17:45,060
"Until So Min's daughter
gets married."

479
00:17:45,170 --> 00:17:46,740
- That's nice.
- "Until"?

480
00:17:46,740 --> 00:17:47,940
Yes, until.

481
00:17:47,940 --> 00:17:49,710
"I'll be watching them from above."

482
00:17:49,710 --> 00:17:52,100
(I'll be watching them from above.)

483
00:17:52,100 --> 00:17:53,680
(Startled)

484
00:17:53,680 --> 00:17:55,980
(Do you want to die?)

485
00:17:57,310 --> 00:17:59,450
- Don't write such lyrics.
- I almost had a heart attack.

486
00:17:59,450 --> 00:18:01,540
Don't write such lyrics.

487
00:18:01,540 --> 00:18:03,080
(I'm just kidding.)

488
00:18:04,580 --> 00:18:08,260
(Now, they focus
and write the lyrics.)

489
00:18:08,760 --> 00:18:12,890
(They reminisce the past 9 years
they've spent together.)

490
00:18:13,790 --> 00:18:14,820
I'm done.

491
00:18:14,820 --> 00:18:15,860
(Time's up.)

492
00:18:15,860 --> 00:18:17,060
This is difficult.

493
00:18:17,540 --> 00:18:19,890
Look at Haha's.

494
00:18:19,890 --> 00:18:21,270
"Being together makes
anyone stronger."

495
00:18:21,270 --> 00:18:23,060
"But we've never been together."

496
00:18:23,060 --> 00:18:25,300
(But we've never been together.)

497
00:18:25,300 --> 00:18:26,600
"They said to go alone if you wanted
to go faster..."

498
00:18:26,600 --> 00:18:27,900
"and to go together if you wanted
to last a long time."

499
00:18:27,900 --> 00:18:29,340
"So we hurried."

500
00:18:30,520 --> 00:18:31,840
(His lyrics are demotivating.)

501
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:33,070
It's fun.

502
00:18:33,250 --> 00:18:34,340
It is.

503
00:18:34,790 --> 00:18:36,340
- I like it.
- Haha is worried...

504
00:18:36,340 --> 00:18:38,290
that it'll be too emotional.

505
00:18:38,290 --> 00:18:40,110
- Right?
- If we give a twist at the end,

506
00:18:40,110 --> 00:18:41,760
it'll be hilarious and fun.

507
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:43,350
This isn't how I truly feel, though.

508
00:18:43,350 --> 00:18:45,050
This kind of vibe is good.

509
00:18:45,050 --> 00:18:46,460
This is Se Chan's.

510
00:18:46,530 --> 00:18:48,560
"Our relationship has lasted
for such a long time..."

511
00:18:48,560 --> 00:18:49,670
"unlike the beginning."

512
00:18:49,670 --> 00:18:51,360
"We all had different occupations
and personalities."

513
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:55,560
"While we chatted in our uniforms,
we heard the word,"

514
00:18:55,560 --> 00:18:56,770
- "'out'."
- "'out'."

515
00:18:56,770 --> 00:18:58,330
(We heard the word, "out".)

516
00:18:58,710 --> 00:19:00,330
I don't think
you should hand this in.

517
00:19:00,330 --> 00:19:02,510
(His lyrics are rejected.)

518
00:19:02,510 --> 00:19:05,450
I have no idea how to write this.

519
00:19:05,450 --> 00:19:06,840
It's so low class.

520
00:19:06,840 --> 00:19:07,840
(Jae Suk gives him
a piece of advice.)

521
00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:09,920
- It's low class?
- It's too low class.

522
00:19:09,920 --> 00:19:11,460
- Did my lyrics fall short?
- Yes, it did.

523
00:19:11,550 --> 00:19:13,380
You can't hand this in.

524
00:19:13,380 --> 00:19:16,150
Let's gather the lyrics
and hand them over to him.

525
00:19:16,150 --> 00:19:17,350
Okay.

526
00:19:17,350 --> 00:19:19,700
I doubt you'll be able to use
much of these.

527
00:19:19,700 --> 00:19:22,200
- This is embarrassing.
- It is.

528
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:23,820
I guess we all felt the same.

529
00:19:23,940 --> 00:19:26,200
Do you have anything to say?

530
00:19:26,330 --> 00:19:28,100
Well... Like what?

531
00:19:30,100 --> 00:19:32,010
(Like what?)

532
00:19:32,010 --> 00:19:33,510
Then we'll end it here.

533
00:19:33,800 --> 00:19:34,800
(He likes how natural Joon Il is.)

534
00:19:34,800 --> 00:19:36,600
- I'm liking this.
- Right.

535
00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:37,980
That was nice and short.

536
00:19:37,980 --> 00:19:39,540
It's very natural.

537
00:19:39,640 --> 00:19:40,810
Thank you!

538
00:19:41,640 --> 00:19:42,750
How great.

539
00:19:42,750 --> 00:19:44,020
(What kind of theme song
will be created?)

540
00:19:44,020 --> 00:19:45,110
(A few days later,
the members gathered together.)

541
00:19:45,110 --> 00:19:46,810
- Hello.
- Hello.

542
00:19:46,810 --> 00:19:49,120
Ji Hyo, will you be rapping?

543
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:50,290
What will happen?

544
00:19:50,290 --> 00:19:51,460
- Yes, she'll rap.
- It'll be awesome.

545
00:19:51,460 --> 00:19:53,430
And we wrote...

546
00:19:53,430 --> 00:19:55,670
- about the members.
- Is that so?

547
00:19:55,670 --> 00:19:58,290
She always says her dance moves
and singing will be awesome.

548
00:19:58,290 --> 00:19:59,470
(It's a habit of hers.)

549
00:19:59,560 --> 00:20:01,270
- It will be awesome.
- It will be awesome.

550
00:20:01,270 --> 00:20:03,670
Another characteristic
of her performance is that...

551
00:20:03,770 --> 00:20:05,010
she may look halfhearted,

552
00:20:05,010 --> 00:20:06,240
- but she's actually doing her best.
- You're right.

553
00:20:06,280 --> 00:20:08,280
- I'm really doing my best.
- Please don't misunderstand her.

554
00:20:08,280 --> 00:20:10,450
She may be dancing like this,
but she's sweating buckets.

555
00:20:10,680 --> 00:20:12,070
She just looks like that.

556
00:20:12,070 --> 00:20:13,720
I hope
no one will misunderstand her.

557
00:20:14,920 --> 00:20:17,610
(It may look like
she's dancing halfheartedly,)

558
00:20:17,610 --> 00:20:20,350
(But she's sweating a lot.)

559
00:20:21,380 --> 00:20:23,790
- Right.
- She always gives her best.

560
00:20:23,790 --> 00:20:25,790
Why are you wearing a hat?

561
00:20:25,790 --> 00:20:27,560
(He suddenly asks
a random question.)

562
00:20:27,560 --> 00:20:29,290
- What about you?
- You're wearing one too.

563
00:20:29,290 --> 00:20:30,500
Are you worried about your forehead?

564
00:20:30,700 --> 00:20:34,540
Your hair takes up 70 percent
of your beauty.

565
00:20:35,560 --> 00:20:37,740
- Don't listen to him.
- I'm serious. It's 70 percent.

566
00:20:37,740 --> 00:20:40,280
You're hilarious.
I've waited for this moment.

567
00:20:40,280 --> 00:20:41,280
(His role model
never disappoints him.)

568
00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:43,450
- Take it off.
- What percent of your hair remains?

569
00:20:43,450 --> 00:20:45,020
- What percent of your hair?
- Me?

570
00:20:45,020 --> 00:20:46,280
About 25 percent.

571
00:20:46,280 --> 00:20:47,280
(He's honest.)

572
00:20:47,790 --> 00:20:49,110
He needs recharging.

573
00:20:49,110 --> 00:20:50,920
I'm barely...

574
00:20:50,920 --> 00:20:52,690
- You're barely holding up.
- I thought it was the worst.

575
00:20:52,690 --> 00:20:56,650
Anyway, we've accepted applications
for our fan-meet since yesterday.

576
00:20:56,650 --> 00:20:59,200
- Oh, really?
- We announced it on TV yesterday.

577
00:20:59,320 --> 00:21:01,470
It's passed 40,000 views so far.

578
00:21:01,470 --> 00:21:02,820
(It reached 170,000 views
on August 4.)

579
00:21:02,820 --> 00:21:05,630
Our stage might be
too small to invite our fans.

580
00:21:05,630 --> 00:21:09,060
No, our event might be
too awful to invite our fans.

581
00:21:09,330 --> 00:21:11,740
We have to prepare so many things
within a short period of time.

582
00:21:11,740 --> 00:21:13,100
- I know.
- Right, it's a bit...

583
00:21:13,100 --> 00:21:15,480
But we're doing our best
like idol singers.

584
00:21:15,480 --> 00:21:16,750
We want to do a good job.

585
00:21:16,840 --> 00:21:17,980
Of course.

586
00:21:17,980 --> 00:21:19,070
(What?)

587
00:21:19,070 --> 00:21:20,790
- Yes.
- Oh, gosh.

588
00:21:20,790 --> 00:21:23,450
- I know.
- It's said Jae Suk is busy...

589
00:21:23,450 --> 00:21:25,290
looking after his second daughter
these days.

590
00:21:25,290 --> 00:21:27,650
That was such an awkward way
of asking a question.

591
00:21:27,880 --> 00:21:30,230
Don't ask him if you don't want to.

592
00:21:30,230 --> 00:21:31,650
- Suk Jin...
- Hey, if my question wasn't enough,

593
00:21:31,650 --> 00:21:32,890
they can use subtitles
to make up for it.

594
00:21:32,890 --> 00:21:35,560
He's a radio show host, by the way.

595
00:21:35,560 --> 00:21:37,670
- Right.
- I hear you enjoy...

596
00:21:37,670 --> 00:21:39,740
looking after your second daughter
these days.

597
00:21:39,740 --> 00:21:41,360
- Oh, dear.
- Goodness,

598
00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:42,470
- rumors say so.
- That's too...

599
00:21:42,470 --> 00:21:44,540
Your second daughter...

600
00:21:44,540 --> 00:21:46,630
Na Eun is...

601
00:21:46,630 --> 00:21:48,280
- She recently started rolling over.
- How old is she?

602
00:21:48,280 --> 00:21:50,180
Her first birthday
is coming up soon.

603
00:21:50,570 --> 00:21:53,570
Isn't that around the time you know
who she resembles?

604
00:21:53,570 --> 00:21:56,540
There are different opinions.
Some people say she looks like me.

605
00:21:56,540 --> 00:21:58,080
Others say she looks like my wife.

606
00:21:58,080 --> 00:21:59,080
Your mood might change
from joy to sorrow.

607
00:21:59,080 --> 00:22:00,080
It changes.

608
00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:02,380
(Your mood might change
from joy to sorrow.)

609
00:22:02,380 --> 00:22:03,620
You might cry and smile.

610
00:22:03,620 --> 00:22:05,430
- What?
- Why?

611
00:22:05,430 --> 00:22:06,530
What's wrong with her resembling me?

612
00:22:06,530 --> 00:22:08,590
It's like going back and forth
between a hot bath and a cold bath.

613
00:22:08,590 --> 00:22:10,390
- What's wrong with that?
- Between a hot and cold bath.

614
00:22:10,430 --> 00:22:12,170
"No, no!"

615
00:22:12,170 --> 00:22:13,540
But she's...

616
00:22:13,540 --> 00:22:14,540
- so adorable.
- She's pretty.

617
00:22:14,540 --> 00:22:15,900
- She might be so pretty.
- I bet.

618
00:22:15,900 --> 00:22:16,970
- I know.
- She's adorable.

619
00:22:16,970 --> 00:22:19,900
Suk Jin appeared
on "Mom's Diary"...

620
00:22:20,180 --> 00:22:21,710
and analyzed
why Jong Kook isn't getting married.

621
00:22:21,710 --> 00:22:24,180
I told them, "It's not that
he can't get married."

622
00:22:24,180 --> 00:22:25,980
"It's that he doesn't want to."

623
00:22:25,980 --> 00:22:28,110
Then they were relieved.

624
00:22:28,110 --> 00:22:29,290
They were like, "Is that true?"

625
00:22:29,290 --> 00:22:32,690
Jong Kook doesn't go on blind dates
even if we offer to set him up.

626
00:22:32,690 --> 00:22:34,080
- It's uncomfortable.
- He doesn't go on blind dates.

627
00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:35,120
Blind dates are uncomfortable.

628
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:37,960
He has to open up a little more.

629
00:22:37,960 --> 00:22:40,090
- I have an idea.
- But he doesn't.

630
00:22:40,090 --> 00:22:41,090
This time...

631
00:22:41,090 --> 00:22:43,060
(Twisting)

632
00:22:44,470 --> 00:22:46,630
- Stop it.
- No, it's a good idea.

633
00:22:46,630 --> 00:22:47,630
(Booing)

634
00:22:48,830 --> 00:22:51,240
I've never hit on a woman before.

635
00:22:51,240 --> 00:22:53,780
Hey, I'm curious.
Did you ask your wife out?

636
00:22:53,780 --> 00:22:54,900
- Of course.
- Really?

637
00:22:54,900 --> 00:22:56,570
- How?
- How did you pick her up?

638
00:22:56,570 --> 00:22:57,780
- I'm curious.
- Hey.

639
00:22:57,870 --> 00:23:00,180
What do you mean, pick her up?
She's your friend's wife.

640
00:23:00,180 --> 00:23:02,110
- I mean, aren't you curious?
- What do you mean,

641
00:23:02,110 --> 00:23:04,380
- pick her up?
- How does Jae Suk pick up girls?

642
00:23:04,380 --> 00:23:06,650
- Tell us how you did it.
- There's nothing special.

643
00:23:06,650 --> 00:23:08,380
- I said, "Let's have a cup of tea."
- Really?

644
00:23:08,380 --> 00:23:10,150
(How old-fashioned.)

645
00:23:10,150 --> 00:23:12,050
"Let's have a cup of tea."

646
00:23:12,050 --> 00:23:14,590
I'm 100 percent sure his lips were
like this when he said that.

647
00:23:14,730 --> 00:23:16,320
His face must've been pale
out of nervousness.

648
00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:18,330
- Because he was nervous.
- You know him so well.

649
00:23:18,470 --> 00:23:19,940
- "Let's have a meal."
- Goodness.

650
00:23:20,090 --> 00:23:22,010
- "Let's have a meal."
- Because he was nervous.

651
00:23:22,010 --> 00:23:23,830
It's so funny to think
he flirted with her.

652
00:23:23,830 --> 00:23:26,100
- "Let's dine together."
- It makes me curious.

653
00:23:26,100 --> 00:23:28,750
I must say...

654
00:23:28,750 --> 00:23:31,280
I went out with her on my own,
but it wasn't the case for him.

655
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:33,370
- It's like I gave him his life.
- Right.

656
00:23:33,370 --> 00:23:34,610
You were his Cupid.

657
00:23:34,610 --> 00:23:37,020
I was his life consultant.

658
00:23:37,020 --> 00:23:38,080
Right.

659
00:23:38,080 --> 00:23:40,290
My life too. Be my life consultant.

660
00:23:40,290 --> 00:23:41,460
- So Min.
- My life.

661
00:23:41,460 --> 00:23:43,050
- Call Se Chan.
- What...

662
00:23:43,050 --> 00:23:45,760
I'm working on it in secret,
so wait just a little.

663
00:23:45,760 --> 00:23:47,860
- In secret?
- He'll be yours soon.

664
00:23:47,860 --> 00:23:50,830
You guys keep setting us up,
so it's become awkward for us...

665
00:23:50,830 --> 00:23:52,560
- It's become awkward?
- to even have a drink.

666
00:23:52,560 --> 00:23:54,470
- I...
- Usually, she was playful to me,

667
00:23:54,470 --> 00:23:55,710
but now she isn't.

668
00:23:56,010 --> 00:23:58,070
- People talk in whispers too.
- We happen...

669
00:23:58,070 --> 00:23:59,600
to avoid talking to each other.

670
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:01,370
He answers my calls
in a cold way too.

671
00:24:01,370 --> 00:24:02,800
Hey, why would you do that?

672
00:24:02,800 --> 00:24:04,250
- Do you do it on purpose?
- No.

673
00:24:04,250 --> 00:24:06,020
- I'm being careful.
- He keeps minding it.

674
00:24:06,020 --> 00:24:08,490
- Se Chan.
- The way I see it,

675
00:24:08,490 --> 00:24:09,610
- he flirts with her too.
- Exactly.

676
00:24:09,610 --> 00:24:11,190
- What?
- He acts like he's indifferent,

677
00:24:11,190 --> 00:24:13,880
- but he leaves room for romance.
- Right, he's a player.

678
00:24:13,880 --> 00:24:15,380
- I know.
- This is absurd.

679
00:24:15,380 --> 00:24:17,700
- Is he good to her?
- He goes,

680
00:24:17,700 --> 00:24:19,320
- "So Min, you're pretty today."
- Right.

681
00:24:19,320 --> 00:24:21,700
- What a jerk.
- He touches her hair.

682
00:24:21,700 --> 00:24:24,060
The heavens never take
everything away from you.

683
00:24:24,060 --> 00:24:25,970
(The heavens didn't take
everything away from him.)

684
00:24:25,970 --> 00:24:27,670
- They leave at least something.
- What are you talking about?

685
00:24:27,670 --> 00:24:29,240
- I mean...
- What do you mean...

686
00:24:29,240 --> 00:24:31,370
- the heavens are fair?
- They leave something.

687
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:34,010
- There are those talents.
- I know.

688
00:24:34,280 --> 00:24:36,480
- What's my talent then?
- So don't be shy.

689
00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:38,870
- Everyone has their strength.
- Right.

690
00:24:38,870 --> 00:24:42,190
As you can see, the weather seems
like it's going to rain.

691
00:24:42,190 --> 00:24:44,380
- The weather forecast said so.
- So today,

692
00:24:44,380 --> 00:24:47,080
we're going to film indoors...

693
00:24:47,080 --> 00:24:48,650
- for you.
- Great.

694
00:24:48,650 --> 00:24:50,690
- That's good.
- Thank you.

695
00:24:50,730 --> 00:24:52,700
Do you remember when I asked you...

696
00:24:52,700 --> 00:24:54,120
- about the food you craved?
- Yes.

697
00:24:54,270 --> 00:24:56,590
- The dishes are ready inside.
- Really?

698
00:24:56,730 --> 00:24:57,740
I mentioned rib eye.

699
00:24:57,740 --> 00:24:59,360
- I said clam kalguksu.
- Pyongyang naengmyeon.

700
00:24:59,360 --> 00:25:00,970
Everything you mentioned
is prepared inside.

701
00:25:00,970 --> 00:25:02,830
- Really?
- I ordered pork ribs too.

702
00:25:02,830 --> 00:25:05,710
You'll be filming indoors
at ease today.

703
00:25:05,710 --> 00:25:07,070
Let's go in first.

704
00:25:07,070 --> 00:25:09,040
- Just like this?
- Nice.

705
00:25:09,250 --> 00:25:10,340
- What's gotten into them?
- It's nice.

706
00:25:10,870 --> 00:25:12,640
- What?
- It's strange.

707
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:13,720
How grateful.

708
00:25:13,840 --> 00:25:14,880
Let's go.

709
00:25:15,290 --> 00:25:16,840
There is a lot of food.

710
00:25:16,840 --> 00:25:17,880
(There are so many dishes
prepared on the table.)

711
00:25:17,880 --> 00:25:19,350
It's no joke.

712
00:25:19,580 --> 00:25:21,190
Ji Hyo,
look at that dried yellow corvina.

713
00:25:21,190 --> 00:25:22,230
That's mine.

714
00:25:22,490 --> 00:25:25,430
- There's patbingsu.
- That must be for dessert.

715
00:25:26,050 --> 00:25:27,050
This is awesome.

716
00:25:28,090 --> 00:25:30,000
I want to eat my clam kalguksu
so much.

717
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:32,360
- Do we just start eating?
- No.

718
00:25:32,440 --> 00:25:34,330
- We can't eat it?
- What...

719
00:25:34,630 --> 00:25:36,540
You ordered these dishes,
so why can't we eat them?

720
00:25:36,540 --> 00:25:39,010
- Wait, that's...
- This is crazy.

721
00:25:39,240 --> 00:25:40,330
- What's that?
- Hey, that's...

722
00:25:40,330 --> 00:25:41,480
- I think we have to pay for it.
- What?

723
00:25:41,480 --> 00:25:42,750
- Our credit cards are here.
- What...

724
00:25:42,750 --> 00:25:43,840
What is this?

725
00:25:44,180 --> 00:25:46,280
(They're personal credit cards
of the members.)

726
00:25:46,280 --> 00:25:47,840
- This is my credit card.
- Wait.

727
00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:49,040
What is going on?

728
00:25:49,110 --> 00:25:50,990
- What are they going to do with...
- I mean...

729
00:25:50,990 --> 00:25:52,720
- Please have a seat, guys.
- What is going on?

730
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:54,080
Is this how you make a profit?

731
00:25:54,620 --> 00:25:56,880
Let me remind you...

732
00:25:56,880 --> 00:26:00,050
of the dishes
which you ordered yesterday.

733
00:26:00,050 --> 00:26:01,320
Jae Suk ordered
Pyongyang naengmyeon...

734
00:26:01,320 --> 00:26:03,000
- and bulgogi.
- Right.

735
00:26:03,230 --> 00:26:05,130
Ji Hyo ordered Pyongyang naengmyeon,

736
00:26:05,130 --> 00:26:06,790
dried yellow corvina,
and green tea rice.

737
00:26:06,790 --> 00:26:08,830
- Suk Jin ordered rib eye.
- Right.

738
00:26:08,830 --> 00:26:12,180
Haha ordered clam kalguksu
and pork ribs.

739
00:26:12,180 --> 00:26:13,780
Se Chan ordered sausage stew.

740
00:26:14,570 --> 00:26:16,870
- Jong Kook ordered naengmyeon.
- Right.

741
00:26:16,870 --> 00:26:18,340
Kwang Soo ordered bean guksu,
big dumplings,

742
00:26:18,340 --> 00:26:19,680
patbingsu, and iced Americano.

743
00:26:19,680 --> 00:26:21,080
You ordered so much.

744
00:26:21,290 --> 00:26:22,580
- What's your problem?
- You even ordered dessert.

745
00:26:22,580 --> 00:26:24,790
I don't know about anything else,
but patbingsu was a nice choice.

746
00:26:24,920 --> 00:26:26,880
- Right?
- Good job.

747
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:28,790
- So Min ordered chicken porridge.
- Right.

748
00:26:28,790 --> 00:26:30,050
That's nice.

749
00:26:30,050 --> 00:26:31,760
Gosh, I hate it the most.

750
00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:34,360
What? Your jokes aren't even better
than the taste of chicken porridge.

751
00:26:34,360 --> 00:26:36,000
(Chicken porridge isn't
as horrible as his jokes.)

752
00:26:36,590 --> 00:26:38,470
What do you mean you hate it?

753
00:26:38,470 --> 00:26:40,940
His nickname is Porridge Face too.

754
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:43,470
He doesn't like things
that resemble him.

755
00:26:44,330 --> 00:26:46,600
Today, you just have to enjoy...

756
00:26:46,600 --> 00:26:48,900
eating the dishes for a long time.

757
00:26:48,900 --> 00:26:50,370
- So why won't you let us eat?
- For a long time?

758
00:26:50,370 --> 00:26:52,020
Today's race is called
Why Can't You Eat Race,

759
00:26:52,020 --> 00:26:53,640
and things won't be easy
for you to eat in this race.

760
00:26:53,640 --> 00:26:55,190
- Goodness.
- I guess...

761
00:26:55,190 --> 00:26:56,640
- this is going to be painful.
- This is too...

762
00:26:56,640 --> 00:27:00,190
Your food will be taken away
exactly in three hours.

763
00:27:00,190 --> 00:27:01,580
- In three hours?
- We're filming the episode...

764
00:27:01,580 --> 00:27:03,260
- only for three hours today.
- Really?

765
00:27:03,260 --> 00:27:04,460
- Really?
- It's nice.

766
00:27:04,460 --> 00:27:07,090
Only if you clear a mission,

767
00:27:07,090 --> 00:27:08,930
you'll get to pay for your food...

768
00:27:08,930 --> 00:27:11,830
and enjoy it within the given time.

769
00:27:11,970 --> 00:27:13,270
We have to pay for it
with our money?

770
00:27:13,270 --> 00:27:15,440
- There are two ways to eat.
- What are they?

771
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:17,940
The first method is to draw cards.

772
00:27:18,600 --> 00:27:20,280
The first-place winner
will get to draw cards.

773
00:27:20,280 --> 00:27:22,370
It will either have, "I Eat for 10
Seconds with Someone Else's Card",

774
00:27:22,400 --> 00:27:23,400
10 seconds?

775
00:27:23,400 --> 00:27:25,520
"I Eat for 10 Seconds with My Card",

776
00:27:25,610 --> 00:27:27,810
"Someone Else Eats for 10 Seconds
with My Card",

777
00:27:27,880 --> 00:27:29,690
- What?
- or "Dud".

778
00:27:29,690 --> 00:27:31,990
The winner will draw
1 of these 4 cards...

779
00:27:31,990 --> 00:27:34,290
and proceed according
to what the card says.

780
00:27:34,290 --> 00:27:37,890
For your information, we took your
credit cards from your managers.

781
00:27:37,890 --> 00:27:38,960
(Members credit card)

782
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:42,470
Here's the second method.
If you clear a special mission,

783
00:27:42,470 --> 00:27:44,200
you and the person of your choice...

784
00:27:44,200 --> 00:27:46,830
may eat for three minutes
with the staff's credit card.

785
00:27:46,860 --> 00:27:47,860
This is what you want.

786
00:27:47,860 --> 00:27:49,540
(They get to eat for 3 minutes.)

787
00:27:49,540 --> 00:27:50,670
- Three minutes?
- That's nice.

788
00:27:50,830 --> 00:27:52,570
This one is nice.

789
00:27:52,570 --> 00:27:54,540
I can even finish eating dessert
within that time.

790
00:27:54,980 --> 00:27:57,480
The special mission
will be informed...

791
00:27:57,480 --> 00:27:58,870
to members who choose to do it.

792
00:27:58,870 --> 00:27:59,980
I've got to do it no matter what.

793
00:27:59,980 --> 00:28:03,020
If you fail to eat anything
within the time limit,

794
00:28:03,020 --> 00:28:04,960
you'll be faced with a penalty.

795
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:07,820
If all of you succeed in eating,

796
00:28:07,820 --> 00:28:09,690
the one with the shortest eating
time will be given the penalty.

797
00:28:09,690 --> 00:28:10,790
What is the penalty?

798
00:28:11,050 --> 00:28:14,730
- That will be revealed later.
- Just the thought of it...

799
00:28:14,730 --> 00:28:17,430
All right, let's start
with the first mission.

800
00:28:17,430 --> 00:28:18,470
- Okay.
- All right.

801
00:28:18,470 --> 00:28:21,000
For the first mission,
you will play...

802
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:22,330
Dice Four Game individually.

803
00:28:22,600 --> 00:28:24,830
- That gives everyone a chance.
- It's fair.

804
00:28:24,830 --> 00:28:28,570
You will throw five dice at once
taking turns.

805
00:28:28,570 --> 00:28:31,450
Per each number of 4 rolled,
1 second will be added...

806
00:28:31,450 --> 00:28:33,370
to your penalty time
that starts from one second.

807
00:28:33,370 --> 00:28:35,190
Here's what the penalty is about.

808
00:28:35,190 --> 00:28:36,750
If none of your dice shows a four,

809
00:28:36,810 --> 00:28:39,260
you'll have your sideburn pulled
as much as your penalty time.

810
00:28:39,550 --> 00:28:41,850
The person next to you
will pull your sideburn.

811
00:28:41,850 --> 00:28:44,320
If you hold out without screaming,
you may counterattack.

812
00:28:44,320 --> 00:28:46,050
If you scream, you'll be eliminated.

813
00:28:46,050 --> 00:28:48,270
You're safe if you roll a four,
and you get penalized if you don't.

814
00:28:48,270 --> 00:28:49,270
That's right.

815
00:28:49,620 --> 00:28:51,790
Okay. Should we start
from Haha then?

816
00:28:51,790 --> 00:28:53,240
- Sounds good.
- Okay.

817
00:28:53,240 --> 00:28:54,330
- Okay.
- Do it.

818
00:28:54,330 --> 00:28:56,240
I better roll some fours.

819
00:28:56,470 --> 00:28:58,180
- I'll roll then.
- Are you up first?

820
00:28:58,180 --> 00:28:59,570
- Yes.
- If you don't roll any fours,

821
00:28:59,570 --> 00:29:01,180
your sideburn will get pulled
for a second.

822
00:29:01,180 --> 00:29:02,340
- That's the minimum penalty time.
- Okay.

823
00:29:02,340 --> 00:29:04,280
- So there must be a four.
- Right.

824
00:29:04,280 --> 00:29:05,310
You better roll that number.

825
00:29:05,450 --> 00:29:07,610
- Please.
- There might be at least one.

826
00:29:08,310 --> 00:29:09,380
(How will the first player do it?)

827
00:29:09,380 --> 00:29:10,380
- Throw it so you get a four.
- There's none.

828
00:29:10,380 --> 00:29:11,690
There's a four.

829
00:29:11,690 --> 00:29:12,690
(He has rolled a 4.)

830
00:29:14,080 --> 00:29:16,320
(Haha rolls a 4 and adds
1 second to the penalty time.)

831
00:29:16,320 --> 00:29:17,460
That's a second
to the penalty time.

832
00:29:17,460 --> 00:29:18,890
- It's two seconds now.
- That was close.

833
00:29:18,890 --> 00:29:20,260
This is hard.

834
00:29:20,260 --> 00:29:21,770
You might not get any fours.

835
00:29:21,770 --> 00:29:23,060
- It's harder than I thought.
- There may not be any.

836
00:29:23,060 --> 00:29:24,970
- It's 2 seconds now.
- Right, 2 seconds.

837
00:29:24,970 --> 00:29:26,240
I wish it was just a second.

838
00:29:27,240 --> 00:29:28,510
- There's none.
- I got a four.

839
00:29:28,830 --> 00:29:30,630
- That's fortunate.
- He got a four.

840
00:29:31,680 --> 00:29:33,780
- Just to roll a four is hard.
- It's hard.

841
00:29:33,780 --> 00:29:35,980
- It's not easy.
- Why is it so nerve-racking?

842
00:29:35,980 --> 00:29:37,010
- Goodness.
- Ji Hyo.

843
00:29:37,010 --> 00:29:39,020
So whoever doesn't roll a four
will suffer the whole penalty.

844
00:29:39,020 --> 00:29:40,840
- Right.
- Only a four is being rolled.

845
00:29:41,310 --> 00:29:42,720
It's at three seconds so far.

846
00:29:43,080 --> 00:29:44,080
(Thud)

847
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:45,880
Ji Hyo failed.

848
00:29:45,880 --> 00:29:48,690
(Ji Hyo will have to get penalized
if she fails to roll a 4.)

849
00:29:48,690 --> 00:29:49,960
- I got a four.
- Goodness.

850
00:29:49,960 --> 00:29:51,230
- She got a four.
- There are 2 of them.

851
00:29:51,230 --> 00:29:52,730
- I got two of them.
- There are 2.

852
00:29:52,730 --> 00:29:53,850
It's five seconds now.

853
00:29:54,530 --> 00:29:56,090
Why did you have to roll 2 of them?

854
00:29:56,090 --> 00:29:57,560
It's going to be horrible
if you don't roll a four.

855
00:29:57,560 --> 00:29:59,440
So it's better to do it first.

856
00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:00,500
Our seats...

857
00:30:00,500 --> 00:30:02,060
(Will Jong Kook roll any 4s?)

858
00:30:02,060 --> 00:30:04,570
- There's got to be at least one.
- Our seats...

859
00:30:05,330 --> 00:30:06,630
- There's got to be at least one.
- He didn't get any.

860
00:30:06,630 --> 00:30:07,780
- There's none.
- There.

861
00:30:07,780 --> 00:30:08,900
- He rolled one.
- There it is.

862
00:30:08,900 --> 00:30:09,950
How fortunate.

863
00:30:10,640 --> 00:30:13,250
It's hard to roll even one.

864
00:30:13,640 --> 00:30:15,920
I guarantee you.

865
00:30:15,920 --> 00:30:17,290
Three of us will get the penalty.

866
00:30:17,290 --> 00:30:18,880
No, it won't be me.

867
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:20,490
- 1 of us 3.
- Not me.

868
00:30:20,490 --> 00:30:22,080
I'm 100 percent sure of it.

869
00:30:22,080 --> 00:30:24,150
- Okay.
- I wish it isn't me.

870
00:30:24,150 --> 00:30:25,350
It's gone up to six seconds now.

871
00:30:25,350 --> 00:30:26,650
Who rolled two of them?

872
00:30:26,730 --> 00:30:28,860
- Ji Hyo.
- Kiss this.

873
00:30:28,860 --> 00:30:30,770
(He asks Ji Hyo
to give it her lucky kiss.)

874
00:30:30,790 --> 00:30:31,830
Come on.

875
00:30:31,830 --> 00:30:33,890
- That's...
- Good.

876
00:30:34,270 --> 00:30:35,510
(They can't believe
what they just heard.)

877
00:30:35,510 --> 00:30:36,670
- What are you doing?
- I was so surprised.

878
00:30:36,670 --> 00:30:38,980
I only heard him say to kiss him.

879
00:30:38,980 --> 00:30:40,070
Gosh, that was...

880
00:30:40,210 --> 00:30:41,570
I mean here.

881
00:30:41,570 --> 00:30:44,010
- I was so shocked.
- I mean a good luck kiss.

882
00:30:44,010 --> 00:30:45,780
<i>Give me a kiss</i>

883
00:30:45,780 --> 00:30:47,040
(The accumulate penalty time is
6 seconds.)

884
00:30:47,040 --> 00:30:48,580
I really want to pass.

885
00:30:48,580 --> 00:30:50,640
- There's no four.
- Please.

886
00:30:50,790 --> 00:30:51,810
There's no four.

887
00:30:52,050 --> 00:30:54,290
(Why did he even get
a good luck kiss?)

888
00:30:55,230 --> 00:30:56,380
- There's no 4.
- No 4s.

889
00:30:56,460 --> 00:30:57,880
- No 4s.
- No 4s.

890
00:30:57,960 --> 00:30:59,530
- There's no 4.
- No 4s.

891
00:30:59,530 --> 00:31:01,120
- Whose turn is it?
- There's no four.

892
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:02,270
- Six seconds.
- This is crazy.

893
00:31:02,270 --> 00:31:03,770
Jong Kook will pull
Suk Jin's sideburn, right?

894
00:31:03,770 --> 00:31:05,040
- Is it my turn?
- Yes.

895
00:31:05,040 --> 00:31:06,040
Is it?

896
00:31:06,040 --> 00:31:07,470
Suk Jin's sideburn will be pulled
for six seconds.

897
00:31:07,470 --> 00:31:09,060
If he can take it,
he can counterattack.

898
00:31:09,060 --> 00:31:11,130
But Suk Jin has no sideburns.

899
00:31:11,130 --> 00:31:12,440
I shaved them off.

900
00:31:12,440 --> 00:31:14,280
- He doesn't have sideburns.
- He doesn't.

901
00:31:14,280 --> 00:31:17,210
Jong Kook might be able
to create them by pulling them out.

902
00:31:17,210 --> 00:31:19,370
(Jong Kook might be able
to create them by pulling them out.)

903
00:31:19,370 --> 00:31:20,480
Jong Kook.

904
00:31:20,680 --> 00:31:21,920
You could pull his ears.

905
00:31:22,420 --> 00:31:24,250
Ears? That'd be...

906
00:31:24,310 --> 00:31:26,380
- I don't have much hair there.
- There's not much, but I got it.

907
00:31:26,460 --> 00:31:28,230
You have six seconds.
I'll say "start".

908
00:31:29,850 --> 00:31:31,120
- Can I start?
- Wait.

909
00:31:31,120 --> 00:31:32,120
Hasn't he started yet?

910
00:31:32,120 --> 00:31:33,930
It hurts. Start right now!

911
00:31:33,930 --> 00:31:35,320
- I haven't started yet.
- You haven't?

912
00:31:35,320 --> 00:31:36,470
I'm not pulling it yet.

913
00:31:36,470 --> 00:31:38,470
- Just holding it hurts.
- I'm just holding it.

914
00:31:38,470 --> 00:31:40,000
- Gosh.
- There's not much hair.

915
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:41,240
- Hold on.
- Ready.

916
00:31:41,270 --> 00:31:42,830
- He can't scream? Hold on.
- And...

917
00:31:43,510 --> 00:31:44,540
start.

918
00:31:46,870 --> 00:31:48,900
(Scary)

919
00:31:49,840 --> 00:31:51,010
(What?)

920
00:31:51,010 --> 00:31:52,040
- Two.
- He's taking it.

921
00:31:52,040 --> 00:31:54,950
(He's taking it.)

922
00:31:54,950 --> 00:31:56,810
(He can't.)

923
00:31:56,810 --> 00:31:58,960
(Screaming)

924
00:31:58,960 --> 00:32:00,260
(We knew it.)

925
00:32:00,460 --> 00:32:02,080
- It's impossible.
- That was crazy.

926
00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:04,650
- He failed after three seconds.
- That was crazy.

927
00:32:04,650 --> 00:32:06,650
- There wasn't much hair.
- Okay, good.

928
00:32:06,650 --> 00:32:08,030
Suk Jin, you're out.

929
00:32:08,390 --> 00:32:09,730
Go over there.

930
00:32:09,890 --> 00:32:11,060
- Am I out?
- Yes.

931
00:32:11,060 --> 00:32:12,270
- Please move over.
- You're out.

932
00:32:12,270 --> 00:32:13,700
Please give me another chance.

933
00:32:13,700 --> 00:32:14,940
What are you talking about?

934
00:32:14,940 --> 00:32:16,400
Please give me another chance.

935
00:32:16,400 --> 00:32:17,670
What are you talking about?

936
00:32:17,670 --> 00:32:19,040
- You don't get another chance.
- What are you doing?

937
00:32:19,040 --> 00:32:21,100
- I didn't know I'd be out.
- "Give me another chance."

938
00:32:21,100 --> 00:32:22,570
I want to take revenge.

939
00:32:22,600 --> 00:32:24,600
- He's being ridiculous.
- I want to take revenge.

940
00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:25,980
Move over.

941
00:32:25,980 --> 00:32:27,540
(Hold on.)

942
00:32:27,610 --> 00:32:29,610
- Do I move up to his seat then?
- Yes, please.

943
00:32:30,490 --> 00:32:32,550
- Okay.
- Okay.

944
00:32:32,790 --> 00:32:34,050
Move up.

945
00:32:34,150 --> 00:32:35,350
- Really?
- Move up.

946
00:32:35,350 --> 00:32:36,580
- It's okay if I get a four.
- I didn't know...

947
00:32:36,580 --> 00:32:38,730
What's the penalty time
if he gets no four?

948
00:32:38,790 --> 00:32:40,760
It's 1 second.
We start over from 1 second.

949
00:32:40,890 --> 00:32:42,320
One second is not bad.

950
00:32:42,560 --> 00:32:43,620
It's better to fail early.

951
00:32:43,620 --> 00:32:45,040
- I don't think he'll get a four.
- Gently.

952
00:32:45,790 --> 00:32:46,860
This will be...

953
00:32:47,830 --> 00:32:49,560
(What did Kwang Soo get?)

954
00:32:49,560 --> 00:32:50,770
- There's no 4.
- There's no 4.

955
00:32:50,830 --> 00:32:52,210
- There's no 4?
- No 4s.

956
00:32:52,210 --> 00:32:53,210
(He's unlucky as usual.)

957
00:32:53,780 --> 00:32:55,100
- No 4s.
- No 4s.

958
00:32:55,540 --> 00:32:56,680
- No 4s.
- That's incredible.

959
00:32:56,800 --> 00:32:58,110
- No 4s.
- 1 second.

960
00:32:58,180 --> 00:32:59,950
- It's 1 second.
- I just have to last 1 second.

961
00:32:59,950 --> 00:33:01,020
It's one second.

962
00:33:01,070 --> 00:33:02,310
(Jong Kook pulls
Kwang Soo's sideburn too.)

963
00:33:02,310 --> 00:33:03,310
Let's see.

964
00:33:03,310 --> 00:33:05,080
- Oh, my.
- Look at that.

965
00:33:05,080 --> 00:33:07,420
- He has so much hair.
- Make him scream right away.

966
00:33:07,420 --> 00:33:08,880
My goodness. Hold on.

967
00:33:09,530 --> 00:33:10,730
Gosh.

968
00:33:11,030 --> 00:33:12,150
Ready.

969
00:33:12,260 --> 00:33:13,350
Hold on.

970
00:33:13,930 --> 00:33:16,890
(The atmosphere is tense.)

971
00:33:16,890 --> 00:33:18,630
(I'll clench my teeth
and fight this.)

972
00:33:18,630 --> 00:33:20,200
Start.

973
00:33:20,200 --> 00:33:21,540
(Screaming)

974
00:33:22,210 --> 00:33:23,740
(Shortly after Kwang Soo
covers his mouth,)

975
00:33:23,740 --> 00:33:25,570
(he screams.)

976
00:33:25,570 --> 00:33:27,070
(What was that?)

977
00:33:27,480 --> 00:33:28,710
(Pulling)

978
00:33:28,900 --> 00:33:30,870
(Kwang Soo is eliminated
right away.)

979
00:33:30,870 --> 00:33:32,480
You're out. Move.

980
00:33:33,250 --> 00:33:35,110
Move. Move, Kwang Soo.

981
00:33:35,580 --> 00:33:37,020
Did I pull his hair out?

982
00:33:37,140 --> 00:33:38,490
Your fingers didn't slip.
You pulled out my hair.

983
00:33:38,490 --> 00:33:39,610
It made a huge sound.

984
00:33:39,790 --> 00:33:41,490
Move.

985
00:33:41,490 --> 00:33:43,260
(Kwang Soo is eliminated too.)

986
00:33:44,080 --> 00:33:45,820
You couldn't take it
for just one second?

987
00:33:45,820 --> 00:33:47,820
It's just impossible.

988
00:33:48,530 --> 00:33:51,390
There's a reason
why some people always lose.

989
00:33:51,770 --> 00:33:53,130
It's only for one second.

990
00:33:53,130 --> 00:33:55,210
How could we get no four?

991
00:33:55,600 --> 00:33:58,210
- The penalty time is one second.
- Okay.

992
00:33:59,130 --> 00:34:01,300
- I'm sure I'll get at least one.
- That was too gentle.

993
00:34:01,300 --> 00:34:02,480
There's no four.

994
00:34:02,480 --> 00:34:04,750
(What did Jae Suk get?)

995
00:34:04,750 --> 00:34:06,280
- There's no 4.
- There's no 4.

996
00:34:06,370 --> 00:34:07,450
No fours!

997
00:34:08,750 --> 00:34:10,190
- There's no 4.
- There's no 4.

998
00:34:10,190 --> 00:34:12,380
- No fours!
- This is so interesting.

999
00:34:13,220 --> 00:34:14,610
I can't believe it.

1000
00:34:14,610 --> 00:34:15,860
(Jae Suk gets no 4 either.)

1001
00:34:15,860 --> 00:34:17,320
This is incredible.

1002
00:34:17,320 --> 00:34:18,900
- Is this a rest area or something?
- No four.

1003
00:34:19,090 --> 00:34:20,750
- A meeting point.
- Is this a famous restaurant?

1004
00:34:20,750 --> 00:34:21,920
- Why is everyone stopping by?
- Just a second.

1005
00:34:21,920 --> 00:34:23,090
Let me...

1006
00:34:23,090 --> 00:34:25,230
- Let me prepare myself.
- All right.

1007
00:34:25,230 --> 00:34:26,300
(Sighing)

1008
00:34:26,300 --> 00:34:27,440
Can you take off your glasses?

1009
00:34:27,500 --> 00:34:29,400
They're in the way.

1010
00:34:29,400 --> 00:34:30,630
Hold on. I just have to last
one second, right?

1011
00:34:30,630 --> 00:34:31,980
Because of Kwang Soo,

1012
00:34:32,480 --> 00:34:34,400
my fingers are smeared with oil.

1013
00:34:34,400 --> 00:34:35,880
My pain won't go away.

1014
00:34:35,880 --> 00:34:37,070
Should I see a doctor?

1015
00:34:37,070 --> 00:34:38,480
I still feel a lingering pain here.

1016
00:34:39,150 --> 00:34:40,270
It's like a virus.

1017
00:34:40,270 --> 00:34:42,290
(While symptoms are being reported,
Jong Kook treats his third client.)

1018
00:34:42,290 --> 00:34:44,090
- Is here okay?
- It already hurts.

1019
00:34:44,090 --> 00:34:45,690
(He only has his fingers on him,
but it hurts.)

1020
00:34:45,690 --> 00:34:46,750
Is that okay?

1021
00:34:46,920 --> 00:34:48,550
Wait. Hold on.

1022
00:34:49,130 --> 00:34:50,750
- Aren't you pulling it?
- No.

1023
00:34:50,750 --> 00:34:52,000
- Ready.
- Wait.

1024
00:34:52,460 --> 00:34:54,090
Ready. Start.

1025
00:34:54,090 --> 00:34:55,090
Gosh.

1026
00:34:56,190 --> 00:34:57,360
(As soon as Jong Kook starts,)

1027
00:34:57,360 --> 00:34:59,440
(Jae Suk falls to the floor.)

1028
00:35:00,190 --> 00:35:02,300
(That could have been me.)

1029
00:35:02,540 --> 00:35:03,710
Did you see that?

1030
00:35:04,540 --> 00:35:05,730
It's impossible not to scream.

1031
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:07,570
- It's impossible.
- Hey!

1032
00:35:07,940 --> 00:35:10,110
- He didn't go easy on us.
- Hey!

1033
00:35:10,110 --> 00:35:11,210
What?

1034
00:35:11,340 --> 00:35:13,840
- It hurts too much!
- So what?

1035
00:35:13,840 --> 00:35:16,110
How could just those three fail?

1036
00:35:16,940 --> 00:35:18,750
- Team Crocodiles.
- It's incredible.

1037
00:35:18,960 --> 00:35:20,610
- It's incredible.
- Okay.

1038
00:35:20,710 --> 00:35:22,190
So Min, if you fail,
your hair will be pulled too.

1039
00:35:22,190 --> 00:35:24,320
She's a girl, but we're...

1040
00:35:25,420 --> 00:35:26,750
very close now.

1041
00:35:26,860 --> 00:35:28,570
Didn't my skin get torn off?

1042
00:35:28,570 --> 00:35:29,690
It probably did.

1043
00:35:29,770 --> 00:35:31,570
- No way.
- Why...

1044
00:35:32,460 --> 00:35:34,270
- No way.
- I'm worried.

1045
00:35:34,340 --> 00:35:35,440
I have to get a four.

1046
00:35:35,710 --> 00:35:37,540
- You're no exception.
- The thing is...

1047
00:35:37,540 --> 00:35:39,480
- She's one of us.
- She's one of us.

1048
00:35:39,480 --> 00:35:40,480
She'll get no four.

1049
00:35:40,480 --> 00:35:42,270
(With the others saying unlucky
words, So Min throws the dice.)

1050
00:35:42,270 --> 00:35:43,940
- She's one of us.
- She's one of us.

1051
00:35:43,940 --> 00:35:45,570
She'll get no four. See?

1052
00:35:45,570 --> 00:35:46,750
There is a four.

1053
00:35:46,750 --> 00:35:49,250
(She is saved by a 4.)

1054
00:35:50,110 --> 00:35:52,480
(I'm safe.)

1055
00:35:52,610 --> 00:35:54,690
- The penalty time is 2 seconds now.
- 2 seconds.

1056
00:35:54,690 --> 00:35:56,460
I'm so relieved.

1057
00:35:56,460 --> 00:35:58,050
I must have broken a bone here.

1058
00:35:58,050 --> 00:35:59,630
(I must have broken a bone here.)

1059
00:35:59,630 --> 00:36:01,730
(I must have broken
my sideburn bones.)

1060
00:36:01,730 --> 00:36:03,360
- Your sideburn bones?
- There's no such thing.

1061
00:36:03,360 --> 00:36:05,570
That's the only way
to explain this amount of pain.

1062
00:36:05,570 --> 00:36:07,800
- Are you talking about these bones?
- There are no bones there.

1063
00:36:07,860 --> 00:36:10,300
- I must have broken them.
- There are no bones there.

1064
00:36:10,460 --> 00:36:11,610
Here we go.

1065
00:36:11,610 --> 00:36:12,840
(Despite the broken sideburn bones,
the game continues.)

1066
00:36:13,480 --> 00:36:15,050
(The penalty time is 2 seconds.
What will Haha get?)

1067
00:36:15,050 --> 00:36:16,650
- Please get fours.
- Please fail.

1068
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:18,050
Please fail.

1069
00:36:18,480 --> 00:36:19,670
- It's a 6.
- There's no 4.

1070
00:36:19,670 --> 00:36:22,420
(No 4s)

1071
00:36:22,420 --> 00:36:24,210
- There's no 4.
- No 4s.

1072
00:36:24,210 --> 00:36:25,710
- No 4s.
- No 4s.

1073
00:36:25,710 --> 00:36:26,750
- No 4s.
- 2 seconds.

1074
00:36:26,750 --> 00:36:28,110
So Min will pull his sideburn
for two seconds.

1075
00:36:28,110 --> 00:36:30,360
- Me?
- You're lucky. It's So Min.

1076
00:36:30,820 --> 00:36:32,900
So Min, show him what you've got.

1077
00:36:33,550 --> 00:36:36,190
Haha keeps whispering to me,
"Go easy on me."

1078
00:36:36,190 --> 00:36:38,090
- Pull it hard.
- You shouldn't.

1079
00:36:38,090 --> 00:36:40,360
- Do like Jong Kook did.
- Right.

1080
00:36:40,360 --> 00:36:41,440
A lot of my hair has
already fallen out.

1081
00:36:42,130 --> 00:36:43,130
All right.

1082
00:36:43,130 --> 00:36:45,000
1, 2, 3.

1083
00:36:45,570 --> 00:36:47,230
1, 2...

1084
00:36:47,540 --> 00:36:48,800
(Time's up.)

1085
00:36:49,340 --> 00:36:51,070
(Pulling)

1086
00:36:51,570 --> 00:36:53,210
(Two seconds passed
without Haha screaming.)

1087
00:36:53,210 --> 00:36:54,770
- Haha gets to counterattack.
- So Min!

1088
00:36:54,770 --> 00:36:55,880
I mean...

1089
00:36:55,880 --> 00:36:57,980
- Can he counterattack?
- The thing is...

1090
00:36:57,980 --> 00:37:00,250
Haha kept moving.

1091
00:37:00,250 --> 00:37:02,090
So this is how So Min joins us.

1092
00:37:02,090 --> 00:37:03,290
That's right.

1093
00:37:03,290 --> 00:37:05,090
She joins us in the end.

1094
00:37:05,520 --> 00:37:07,590
This is how So Min joins us.

1095
00:37:07,590 --> 00:37:09,190
She's joining us now.

1096
00:37:09,570 --> 00:37:10,820
- Now I understand.
- Look at this.

1097
00:37:11,360 --> 00:37:13,070
- Did your hair get pulled out?
- So much got pulled out.

1098
00:37:13,270 --> 00:37:14,800
It won't grow back either.

1099
00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:17,300
Since Haha didn't scream, he gets
to counterattack for two seconds.

1100
00:37:17,540 --> 00:37:20,730
If So Min doesn't scream either,
can she attack again?

1101
00:37:21,130 --> 00:37:22,800
No. The game will start over.

1102
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:23,940
It'll start over.

1103
00:37:24,550 --> 00:37:26,440
- Ready.
- No grabbing.

1104
00:37:26,440 --> 00:37:27,550
- Grab where?
- My neck.

1105
00:37:27,610 --> 00:37:29,320
You escaped earlier.

1106
00:37:29,320 --> 00:37:30,940
That's your problem.

1107
00:37:31,210 --> 00:37:33,420
This is my first time pulling on
someone's sideburn.

1108
00:37:33,420 --> 00:37:36,520
So Min's mom becomes very worried
when she watches this show.

1109
00:37:36,520 --> 00:37:39,090
- Does she laugh at these things?
- She doesn't worry about this.

1110
00:37:39,090 --> 00:37:40,920
She's worried about me
getting involved with Suk Jin.

1111
00:37:41,860 --> 00:37:44,170
(She's worried about me
getting involved with Suk Jin.)

1112
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:45,630
That's dangerous.

1113
00:37:45,940 --> 00:37:47,440
Do you want to be penalized
instead of her?

1114
00:37:47,940 --> 00:37:49,070
Suk Jin...

1115
00:37:49,070 --> 00:37:51,210
- "Penalized me instead of her."
- Okay.

1116
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:53,210
That's dangerous.

1117
00:37:54,130 --> 00:37:55,840
- How long?
- Two seconds.

1118
00:37:55,840 --> 00:37:57,070
(Haha gets to attack So Min
for 2 seconds.)

1119
00:37:57,070 --> 00:37:58,520
Gosh.

1120
00:37:59,320 --> 00:38:00,340
Start.

1121
00:38:00,340 --> 00:38:01,440
Fail.

1122
00:38:01,920 --> 00:38:04,020
(Screaming)

1123
00:38:04,650 --> 00:38:05,980
(As soon as the attack started,)

1124
00:38:05,980 --> 00:38:08,420
(So Min screamed.)

1125
00:38:08,420 --> 00:38:10,250
Just forget that
you shouldn't scream.

1126
00:38:10,480 --> 00:38:11,520
So Min, come here.

1127
00:38:11,520 --> 00:38:12,520
Why did I scream?

1128
00:38:12,730 --> 00:38:13,800
I don't understand.

1129
00:38:13,800 --> 00:38:15,170
(Haha survives, and So Min is out.
The game restarts from Se Chan.)

1130
00:38:15,170 --> 00:38:17,420
But even if you survive to the end,
you'll have to beat Jong Kook.

1131
00:38:17,420 --> 00:38:18,860
- Exactly.
- Who knows?

1132
00:38:19,400 --> 00:38:21,710
- He got a 4.
- He got a 4.

1133
00:38:22,110 --> 00:38:23,270
He got a 4.

1134
00:38:23,770 --> 00:38:25,130
Okay. I got one.

1135
00:38:25,130 --> 00:38:26,210
(Okay. I got one.)

1136
00:38:26,210 --> 00:38:29,710
(The penalty time is 2 seconds.
It's Ji Hyo's turn.)

1137
00:38:29,710 --> 00:38:30,940
(What will Ji Hyo get?)

1138
00:38:30,940 --> 00:38:32,250
I think she'll get fours.

1139
00:38:32,250 --> 00:38:33,670
- No.
- There's no 4.

1140
00:38:33,670 --> 00:38:35,480
- No 4s.
- No 4s.

1141
00:38:35,480 --> 00:38:36,480
(Ji Hyo gets no 4.)

1142
00:38:37,380 --> 00:38:39,190
(Gosh)

1143
00:38:39,190 --> 00:38:41,050
It's 2 seconds.
You just have to last 2 seconds.

1144
00:38:41,050 --> 00:38:42,380
- Who pulls her sideburn?
- Se Chan.

1145
00:38:42,380 --> 00:38:43,480
Is it my turn?

1146
00:38:43,730 --> 00:38:44,790
Se Chan is strong.

1147
00:38:44,790 --> 00:38:46,360
- But Ji Hyo is strong too.
- Two seconds.

1148
00:38:46,860 --> 00:38:48,020
Her hair will get pulled out.

1149
00:38:48,800 --> 00:38:50,230
Start.

1150
00:38:50,730 --> 00:38:52,440
- 1, 2...
- She's putting up with it.

1151
00:38:52,540 --> 00:38:54,670
- Three...
- Look at her face.

1152
00:38:55,710 --> 00:38:57,460
(Angry)

1153
00:38:57,460 --> 00:38:59,480
- She's taking it.
- Look at her face.

1154
00:38:59,480 --> 00:39:01,110
Wasn't that longer than two seconds?

1155
00:39:01,500 --> 00:39:04,110
- Ji Hyo's jaw was trembling.
- Her jaw was trembling.

1156
00:39:04,300 --> 00:39:06,710
Why are you trying so hard?
You'll have to go through me anyway.

1157
00:39:06,710 --> 00:39:08,070
(Why are you trying so hard?)

1158
00:39:08,070 --> 00:39:09,420
(You'll have to go
through me anyway.)

1159
00:39:09,880 --> 00:39:11,110
That's right.

1160
00:39:11,380 --> 00:39:12,650
It's Jong Kook in the end.

1161
00:39:12,650 --> 00:39:14,460
- Counterattack.
- Counterattack.

1162
00:39:15,190 --> 00:39:17,480
1, 2, 3.

1163
00:39:17,730 --> 00:39:19,630
Gosh, that hurts.

1164
00:39:20,460 --> 00:39:21,550
(Pulling)

1165
00:39:21,860 --> 00:39:23,570
(What is this?)

1166
00:39:23,570 --> 00:39:25,540
(I accidentally
pulled out his hair.)

1167
00:39:26,500 --> 00:39:28,270
You're not supposed
to pull the hair out.

1168
00:39:28,270 --> 00:39:30,170
You're supposed to just pull.

1169
00:39:30,610 --> 00:39:31,840
It was like she was waxing his hair.

1170
00:39:31,840 --> 00:39:33,480
You're incredible, Ji Hyo.

1171
00:39:33,800 --> 00:39:35,440
She pulled my hair out.

1172
00:39:35,440 --> 00:39:37,170
I didn't mean to pull it out.

1173
00:39:37,170 --> 00:39:39,610
- Jong Kook will win anyway.
- Is it my turn?

1174
00:39:39,920 --> 00:39:41,790
But Ji Hyo has a chance
because she's Ji Hyo.

1175
00:39:41,790 --> 00:39:44,440
No. Jong Kook...

1176
00:39:44,650 --> 00:39:45,820
- No 4s.
- No 4s.

1177
00:39:45,820 --> 00:39:47,020
- There is a four.
- There is.

1178
00:39:47,020 --> 00:39:48,730
(Jong Kook gets 1.)

1179
00:39:49,360 --> 00:39:50,730
I got one in the end.

1180
00:39:50,730 --> 00:39:51,800
You're incredible.

1181
00:39:51,800 --> 00:39:53,300
Keep accumulating the time.

1182
00:39:53,360 --> 00:39:54,860
I got one in the end.

1183
00:39:54,920 --> 00:39:56,820
I hope the penalty time will
go up to 12 seconds or something.

1184
00:39:59,630 --> 00:40:01,460
- I hope the time will go up.
- There's a 4.

1185
00:40:01,540 --> 00:40:02,710
There is.

1186
00:40:03,960 --> 00:40:05,610
(The penalty time is 3 seconds.
What will Ji Hyo get?)

1187
00:40:05,610 --> 00:40:07,340
- I hope she'll get three.
- She got it.

1188
00:40:07,340 --> 00:40:08,800
- She got it.
- She got two.

1189
00:40:08,800 --> 00:40:10,650
(Ji Hyo gets 2.)

1190
00:40:10,750 --> 00:40:12,320
She got two.

1191
00:40:12,320 --> 00:40:13,750
- The penalty time is...
- Five seconds.

1192
00:40:13,750 --> 00:40:14,940
(The penalty time is 5 seconds.
It's Jong Kook's turn again.)

1193
00:40:14,940 --> 00:40:15,980
Here we go.

1194
00:40:16,190 --> 00:40:17,250
Okay!

1195
00:40:19,610 --> 00:40:21,750
- He got it.
- Again?

1196
00:40:22,480 --> 00:40:23,920
- He got two.
- Unbelievable.

1197
00:40:24,050 --> 00:40:25,690
- 7 seconds.
- 7 seconds.

1198
00:40:25,920 --> 00:40:27,920
- The time is getting longer.
- This is getting fun.

1199
00:40:27,920 --> 00:40:29,070
It's going up.

1200
00:40:29,070 --> 00:40:30,130
I hope it gets even longer.

1201
00:40:30,420 --> 00:40:31,590
That's the fun part.

1202
00:40:31,590 --> 00:40:33,540
Seven seconds wouldn't be easy
even for Jong Kook.

1203
00:40:34,360 --> 00:40:37,230
(Extremely nervous,
Haha throws the dice.)

1204
00:40:37,230 --> 00:40:38,300
He rolled the dice.

1205
00:40:38,300 --> 00:40:39,730
(What will be the result?)

1206
00:40:39,730 --> 00:40:40,770
- Did he get it?
- He got it.

1207
00:40:40,770 --> 00:40:41,940
- I got it.
- My goodness.

1208
00:40:41,940 --> 00:40:43,840
- He got 2.
- He got 2.

1209
00:40:44,880 --> 00:40:47,050
- The time is at nine seconds.
- This is crazy.

1210
00:40:47,050 --> 00:40:48,380
- It will reach 12 seconds.
- Seriously.

1211
00:40:48,380 --> 00:40:49,840
It will end this round.

1212
00:40:49,940 --> 00:40:52,250
People get four so easily.

1213
00:40:52,250 --> 00:40:53,610
Why didn't we get a single four?

1214
00:40:53,610 --> 00:40:55,550
- It's fascinating.
- I am so annoyed.

1215
00:40:55,550 --> 00:40:57,980
Why did I get eliminated
even though I got a four?

1216
00:40:57,980 --> 00:40:59,360
(Will Ji Hyo join the members
who always get the penalty?)

1217
00:40:59,360 --> 00:41:00,690
I am really bad at playing games.

1218
00:41:01,360 --> 00:41:02,590
- She got it.
- It's another four.

1219
00:41:02,920 --> 00:41:04,820
(Ji Hyo adds another 4
to the record.)

1220
00:41:05,360 --> 00:41:06,730
She got one.

1221
00:41:06,730 --> 00:41:07,840
The time is at 10 seconds.

1222
00:41:07,840 --> 00:41:09,440
I am doomed.

1223
00:41:09,570 --> 00:41:11,040
No one can hold out for that long.

1224
00:41:11,610 --> 00:41:12,940
Not even Jong Kook can hold out
for that long.

1225
00:41:12,940 --> 00:41:14,610
(What will be Jong Kook's result?)

1226
00:41:14,610 --> 00:41:16,210
If the pulling drags on...

1227
00:41:16,380 --> 00:41:18,270
- He got it.
- It's another four.

1228
00:41:18,270 --> 00:41:19,750
(Jong Kook adds another 4
to the record.)

1229
00:41:20,210 --> 00:41:21,880
- I can't believe it.
- The time is at 11 seconds.

1230
00:41:21,880 --> 00:41:24,340
My prediction will come true.
They will get 12 seconds.

1231
00:41:24,420 --> 00:41:25,860
I am doomed.

1232
00:41:26,110 --> 00:41:28,520
It's a matter of where
the bomb goes off.

1233
00:41:28,920 --> 00:41:30,650
It's like "Family Arcade".

1234
00:41:31,730 --> 00:41:32,730
(The accumulated time
is 11 seconds.)

1235
00:41:32,730 --> 00:41:34,550
It's about time
he doesn't get a four.

1236
00:41:34,550 --> 00:41:35,770
(Haha rolls the dice.)

1237
00:41:35,770 --> 00:41:38,900
(What will be the result?)

1238
00:41:39,230 --> 00:41:40,840
Is there four?

1239
00:41:40,840 --> 00:41:42,670
- There is a four.
- I got it.

1240
00:41:43,630 --> 00:41:44,960
I got it.

1241
00:41:45,130 --> 00:41:46,400
My goodness.

1242
00:41:46,400 --> 00:41:47,540
12 seconds.

1243
00:41:47,540 --> 00:41:48,710
(The accumulated time is
12 seconds.)

1244
00:41:48,710 --> 00:41:51,070
Someone's hair will get waxed.

1245
00:41:51,070 --> 00:41:52,170
This is incredible.

1246
00:41:52,170 --> 00:41:55,250
(What will be Ji Hyo's result?)

1247
00:41:56,420 --> 00:41:57,420
Ji Hyo will get it.

1248
00:41:57,480 --> 00:41:58,920
- Didn't she get it?
- She didn't get it.

1249
00:41:58,920 --> 00:42:00,150
(There is no 4.)

1250
00:42:00,980 --> 00:42:02,520
(How did this happen?)

1251
00:42:02,520 --> 00:42:03,590
- She didn't get it.
- It's Ji Hyo.

1252
00:42:03,790 --> 00:42:05,590
- 12 seconds.
- 12 seconds.

1253
00:42:05,590 --> 00:42:09,500
- Ji Hyo.
- It's really 12 seconds.

1254
00:42:09,500 --> 00:42:11,860
My prediction came true.

1255
00:42:12,460 --> 00:42:14,360
It's impossible to hold out
for 12 seconds.

1256
00:42:15,090 --> 00:42:16,230
Ji Hyo can do it.

1257
00:42:16,460 --> 00:42:17,670
She will scream.

1258
00:42:17,730 --> 00:42:19,500
- Here I go.
- Say "Start" when you go.

1259
00:42:19,500 --> 00:42:20,710
Start.

1260
00:42:20,710 --> 00:42:22,570
1, 2.

1261
00:42:22,570 --> 00:42:23,880
(Ouch!)

1262
00:42:23,880 --> 00:42:25,340
She made a noise.

1263
00:42:25,820 --> 00:42:27,210
(I think it's going to hurt.)

1264
00:42:27,210 --> 00:42:29,090
(Ouch!)

1265
00:42:29,380 --> 00:42:30,480
She is wise.

1266
00:42:30,480 --> 00:42:31,520
(She shouted right away.)

1267
00:42:31,520 --> 00:42:33,480
I am sorry. I pulled a hair out.

1268
00:42:34,190 --> 00:42:37,590
- Okay.
- This is a meaningless fight.

1269
00:42:37,590 --> 00:42:39,550
- Don't say that. You might win.
- You never know.

1270
00:42:39,550 --> 00:42:40,590
You might win.

1271
00:42:40,590 --> 00:42:43,090
Jong Kook will win in the end.

1272
00:42:43,090 --> 00:42:45,730
My mind is at ease
now that Ji Hyo is out.

1273
00:42:46,400 --> 00:42:49,630
(The accumulated time is 6 seconds.)

1274
00:42:50,540 --> 00:42:53,110
(What will be Haha's result?)

1275
00:42:53,110 --> 00:42:54,540
- He got it.
- Did he get it?

1276
00:42:54,730 --> 00:42:56,170
- He got it again.
- I got it.

1277
00:42:56,170 --> 00:42:57,940
(Haha got a 4.)

1278
00:42:59,150 --> 00:43:00,820
(Okay, I got one.)

1279
00:43:00,920 --> 00:43:02,150
- What's the time?
- Seven seconds.

1280
00:43:02,150 --> 00:43:03,290
Okay.

1281
00:43:03,290 --> 00:43:04,840
The accumulated time
keeps getting longer.

1282
00:43:05,090 --> 00:43:06,690
Jong Kook is so relaxed.

1283
00:43:09,520 --> 00:43:10,590
- He didn't get it.
- What?

1284
00:43:10,590 --> 00:43:12,230
(There is no four.)

1285
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:14,690
- Didn't I get a four?
- No, you didn't.

1286
00:43:14,690 --> 00:43:16,400
- Okay.
- This is your last chance.

1287
00:43:16,570 --> 00:43:18,090
If you don't eliminate him now,
you will lose.

1288
00:43:18,090 --> 00:43:19,730
This round will decide the victor.

1289
00:43:19,730 --> 00:43:21,000
If you don't eliminate him now,
you will lose.

1290
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:22,130
Seven seconds.

1291
00:43:22,130 --> 00:43:23,170
Go ahead.

1292
00:43:23,170 --> 00:43:25,070
I am not joking when I say this.
I am sorry for being boring,

1293
00:43:25,070 --> 00:43:26,400
but I can't feel pain.

1294
00:43:26,770 --> 00:43:28,340
Come on.

1295
00:43:28,340 --> 00:43:29,400
(Haha is already annoyed.)

1296
00:43:29,400 --> 00:43:31,400
- Seven seconds.
- What am I supposed to do?

1297
00:43:31,710 --> 00:43:33,420
He is bluffing, right?

1298
00:43:33,550 --> 00:43:36,380
- It makes no sense.
- Everyone can feel pain.

1299
00:43:36,380 --> 00:43:37,480
Seven seconds.

1300
00:43:37,480 --> 00:43:39,290
You are out if you make a noise.

1301
00:43:39,420 --> 00:43:41,320
I will start the timer
when you say "Start".

1302
00:43:41,320 --> 00:43:45,130
(Between Haha and Jong Kook,
who will be the winner?)

1303
00:43:45,690 --> 00:43:46,920
Start.

1304
00:43:46,920 --> 00:43:48,690
(Pulling)

1305
00:43:48,800 --> 00:43:50,500
(He pulls as hard as he can.)

1306
00:43:51,590 --> 00:43:52,840
(My name is Jong Kook
and I don't feel pain.)

1307
00:43:52,840 --> 00:43:54,070
Doesn't it hurt?

1308
00:43:54,800 --> 00:43:56,210
- Really?
- How does that not hurt?

1309
00:43:56,400 --> 00:43:57,770
- Smack him.
- Really?

1310
00:43:58,130 --> 00:43:59,480
This is crazy.

1311
00:43:59,480 --> 00:44:01,230
- What was that?
- Did you pull hard?

1312
00:44:01,440 --> 00:44:03,210
- This is crazy.
- What was that?

1313
00:44:03,210 --> 00:44:04,570
Did you pull hard?

1314
00:44:04,570 --> 00:44:05,710
- Yes.
- It didn't feel like it.

1315
00:44:05,920 --> 00:44:07,110
I pulled hard.

1316
00:44:07,110 --> 00:44:09,110
- I pulled hard.
- Really? It didn't feel like it.

1317
00:44:09,250 --> 00:44:11,250
Haha's muscles were bulging.

1318
00:44:11,250 --> 00:44:12,590
All right. Come here.
Hurry up and sit down.

1319
00:44:13,320 --> 00:44:15,150
(Come here. Hurry up and sit down.)

1320
00:44:15,790 --> 00:44:16,880
(Scared)

1321
00:44:16,880 --> 00:44:18,730
- Sit down. How many seconds?
- He will die either way.

1322
00:44:18,820 --> 00:44:20,400
This is a game...

1323
00:44:20,550 --> 00:44:22,400
for Kim Jong Kook.

1324
00:44:22,500 --> 00:44:23,690
He can withstand pain.

1325
00:44:23,690 --> 00:44:24,860
I have a suggestion.

1326
00:44:24,860 --> 00:44:27,500
Why don't we name Haha the victor
if he holds out?

1327
00:44:27,500 --> 00:44:28,840
- Sure.
- Let's do that.

1328
00:44:28,840 --> 00:44:30,400
- Don't pull this part.
- Haha will win...

1329
00:44:30,400 --> 00:44:31,610
if he holds out for seven seconds.

1330
00:44:31,610 --> 00:44:33,770
- He won't be able to hold out.
- Of course not.

1331
00:44:33,770 --> 00:44:35,880
Haha is terrible
at withstanding pain.

1332
00:44:35,880 --> 00:44:37,110
- Don't do that.
- I got it.

1333
00:44:37,110 --> 00:44:38,610
- I got it.
- That hurts. Hold on.

1334
00:44:38,610 --> 00:44:39,880
(He is struggling already.)

1335
00:44:39,880 --> 00:44:41,070
It hurts just grabbing on to it.

1336
00:44:41,150 --> 00:44:43,020
That hurts. That hurts.
I am in pain.

1337
00:44:43,480 --> 00:44:44,750
- Can I start?
- Start.

1338
00:44:44,750 --> 00:44:45,750
(Pulling)

1339
00:44:45,750 --> 00:44:46,880
He is holding out!

1340
00:44:47,150 --> 00:44:48,250
Start.

1341
00:44:48,250 --> 00:44:49,820
(Scary)

1342
00:44:50,790 --> 00:44:51,790
He is taking it!

1343
00:44:52,500 --> 00:44:53,920
- He is taking it.
- My goodness.

1344
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:55,050
Start.

1345
00:44:57,270 --> 00:45:00,400
(Screaming)

1346
00:45:01,570 --> 00:45:03,570
(He surrendered in 3 seconds.)

1347
00:45:03,570 --> 00:45:05,130
(Screaming)

1348
00:45:05,130 --> 00:45:06,900
That was pathetic.

1349
00:45:07,900 --> 00:45:09,500
- That was pathetic.
- That was pathetic.

1350
00:45:09,550 --> 00:45:11,210
That was seriously pathetic.

1351
00:45:11,380 --> 00:45:12,980
Twisting your body was
a good strategy,

1352
00:45:12,980 --> 00:45:14,570
but Jong Kook set it straight
right away.

1353
00:45:14,570 --> 00:45:15,690
I know.

1354
00:45:15,690 --> 00:45:16,840
It was like a UFC fight.

1355
00:45:17,090 --> 00:45:18,380
Jong Kook grabbed him.

1356
00:45:18,380 --> 00:45:20,210
I told you that my bones hurt.

1357
00:45:20,210 --> 00:45:22,250
This game is so annoying.

1358
00:45:22,730 --> 00:45:23,960
Okay.

1359
00:45:24,150 --> 00:45:26,630
- This, Jong Kook won.
- Okay.

1360
00:45:26,800 --> 00:45:28,860
Jong Kook, you need to make
a choice.

1361
00:45:28,860 --> 00:45:31,020
Will you choose a Mystery Card...

1362
00:45:31,020 --> 00:45:33,190
or a special mission?

1363
00:45:33,190 --> 00:45:36,630
(He needs to make a choice
that will help him eat.)

1364
00:45:37,460 --> 00:45:38,880
I'll go with the Mystery Card.

1365
00:45:38,880 --> 00:45:40,800
(He chooses the Mystery Card.)

1366
00:45:40,940 --> 00:45:42,300
We don't know which card
he will get.

1367
00:45:42,300 --> 00:45:43,400
(He will eat and pay
as the card instructs.)

1368
00:45:43,400 --> 00:45:45,070
I'll go with the Mystery Card.

1369
00:45:45,070 --> 00:45:47,440
He lost hair too.
Why didn't it hurt?

1370
00:45:47,750 --> 00:45:50,190
(Why didn't it hurt?)

1371
00:45:50,190 --> 00:45:52,590
- It really didn't hurt.
- Why didn't it hurt?

1372
00:45:52,650 --> 00:45:54,480
He said he doesn't feel pain.

1373
00:45:54,480 --> 00:45:56,380
His facial expression didn't change.

1374
00:45:56,380 --> 00:45:59,460
I want to see Jong Kook
hunched over in pain...

1375
00:45:59,460 --> 00:46:01,360
on my way to the restroom.

1376
00:46:01,590 --> 00:46:02,630
(Four cards are shown to Jong Kook.)

1377
00:46:02,630 --> 00:46:04,770
- There are four cards.
- Okay.

1378
00:46:04,770 --> 00:46:06,590
There are
I Eat for 10 Seconds with My Card,

1379
00:46:06,590 --> 00:46:08,040
I Eat for 10 Seconds
with Someone Else's Card,

1380
00:46:08,040 --> 00:46:09,630
Someone Else Eats for 10 Seconds
with My Card, and Dud.

1381
00:46:09,630 --> 00:46:12,940
- Those are the four cards.
- Okay.

1382
00:46:14,400 --> 00:46:16,500
I hope he gets Someone Else Eats
for 10 Seconds with My Card.

1383
00:46:16,500 --> 00:46:17,650
(The worst options are Dud...)

1384
00:46:17,650 --> 00:46:18,750
(or Someone Else Eats for 10 Seconds
with My Card.)

1385
00:46:18,750 --> 00:46:19,770
Okay.

1386
00:46:20,980 --> 00:46:22,420
1, 2, 3.

1387
00:46:22,420 --> 00:46:25,290
(Jong Kook received a benefit
for withstanding the hair-pulling.)

1388
00:46:25,290 --> 00:46:26,860
(What will be
the result of the benefit?)

1389
00:46:27,020 --> 00:46:28,210
1, 2, 3.

1390
00:46:30,920 --> 00:46:32,360
(Which card did Jong Kook choose?)

1391
00:46:32,360 --> 00:46:34,180
Someone Else Eats for 10 Seconds
with My Card.

1392
00:46:34,180 --> 00:46:36,150
(My goodness.)

1393
00:46:37,130 --> 00:46:39,130
(Yes!)

1394
00:46:39,820 --> 00:46:41,360
It's a party!

1395
00:46:41,530 --> 00:46:42,930
It's a party!

1396
00:46:42,930 --> 00:46:44,900
(That serves Jong Kook right.)

1397
00:46:44,900 --> 00:46:47,030
- I didn't think it would happen.
- Play some music.

1398
00:46:47,400 --> 00:46:48,930
(I am so happy.)

1399
00:46:48,930 --> 00:46:51,240
It's no wonder
I didn't want to pick a card.

1400
00:46:51,430 --> 00:46:52,970
I had my eyes...

1401
00:46:53,130 --> 00:46:54,880
on one card,

1402
00:46:54,880 --> 00:46:56,200
but you mixed the cards.

1403
00:46:56,300 --> 00:46:57,400
I was like...

1404
00:46:57,800 --> 00:46:59,550
Then who will eat?

1405
00:46:59,550 --> 00:47:01,510
Jong Kook will choose one member...

1406
00:47:01,510 --> 00:47:03,510
(Does Jong Kook get to choose
the member who will eat?)

1407
00:47:03,510 --> 00:47:05,360
Jong Kook will choose one member...

1408
00:47:05,360 --> 00:47:06,610
- to eat for 10 seconds.
- I see.

1409
00:47:06,780 --> 00:47:08,220
Do I get to choose?

1410
00:47:08,490 --> 00:47:10,490
Jong Kook, I won't eat much.

1411
00:47:10,490 --> 00:47:12,860
- I will eat what you choose.
- I will eat what you choose.

1412
00:47:12,950 --> 00:47:15,430
I want to eat
what I ordered, patbingsu.

1413
00:47:15,530 --> 00:47:17,070
- I want dried yellow corvina.
- Dried yellow corvina.

1414
00:47:17,300 --> 00:47:19,700
I didn't have a single meal
since I was busy watching my kids.

1415
00:47:19,700 --> 00:47:22,340
(I didn't have a single meal
since I was busy watching my kids.)

1416
00:47:22,840 --> 00:47:24,570
I think I can eat anything.

1417
00:47:25,180 --> 00:47:26,900
Gosh, I am dizzy.

1418
00:47:27,300 --> 00:47:28,800
Then you should rest.

1419
00:47:28,800 --> 00:47:30,380
(Is that so?)

1420
00:47:30,570 --> 00:47:31,880
(Jong Kook is considerate.)

1421
00:47:31,880 --> 00:47:34,740
- It's okay.
- You should rest.

1422
00:47:34,740 --> 00:47:36,240
You should rest.

1423
00:47:36,240 --> 00:47:38,380
- All right.
- In that case...

1424
00:47:38,380 --> 00:47:39,590
(Jong Kook made a decision.)

1425
00:47:39,680 --> 00:47:42,360
(One member will eat and become
less likely to receive a penalty.)

1426
00:47:42,820 --> 00:47:44,680
- Haha.
- Thank you.

1427
00:47:44,680 --> 00:47:45,800
(Haha is struggling to raise
his third child.)

1428
00:47:45,800 --> 00:47:46,800
(Haha finally gets to have a meal.)

1429
00:47:46,800 --> 00:47:49,970
- Thank you.
- He suffered the last hair-pulling.

1430
00:47:49,970 --> 00:47:51,490
You are quite fair.

1431
00:47:51,590 --> 00:47:53,740
This is driving me crazy.

1432
00:47:53,740 --> 00:47:55,130
What are you going to eat?

1433
00:47:55,130 --> 00:47:57,470
I will eat Pyongyang naengmyeon.

1434
00:47:57,470 --> 00:47:58,570
Okay.

1435
00:47:58,740 --> 00:48:00,180
- Thank you for the food.
- Okay.

1436
00:48:00,280 --> 00:48:01,470
Eat a lot.

1437
00:48:01,470 --> 00:48:03,070
- It's about 10 dollars, right?
- Yes.

1438
00:48:03,070 --> 00:48:04,150
That's right.

1439
00:48:04,610 --> 00:48:07,050
- My goodness.
- This is an eating show.

1440
00:48:07,050 --> 00:48:08,380
It must be cold.

1441
00:48:08,380 --> 00:48:10,490
It's the perfect dish for this hour.

1442
00:48:10,550 --> 00:48:12,280
You only need 10 seconds
to finish that.

1443
00:48:12,780 --> 00:48:15,630
Get ready. Set, go.

1444
00:48:15,630 --> 00:48:17,820
(The 10 seconds start.)

1445
00:48:21,760 --> 00:48:23,170
(My goodness.)

1446
00:48:23,170 --> 00:48:24,970
That sounds amazing.

1447
00:48:25,840 --> 00:48:28,090
You should drink the soup as well.

1448
00:48:28,090 --> 00:48:29,510
It's not tasty
if you eat that way.

1449
00:48:29,510 --> 00:48:31,200
Drink the soup.

1450
00:48:31,200 --> 00:48:33,800
Drink the soup as well.

1451
00:48:33,800 --> 00:48:34,900
- There you go.
- Eat a piece of meat.

1452
00:48:34,900 --> 00:48:38,610
- Eat a piece of meat.
- There you go.

1453
00:48:38,610 --> 00:48:40,010
(The referees run over.)

1454
00:48:40,010 --> 00:48:41,780
He has noodles in his mouth.
What is going on?

1455
00:48:41,780 --> 00:48:43,840
You can only eat for 10 seconds.

1456
00:48:43,840 --> 00:48:46,360
- What is going on?
- It's "Pirates of the Caribbean".

1457
00:48:46,510 --> 00:48:48,630
It's "Pirates of the Caribbean".

1458
00:48:48,630 --> 00:48:51,150
- Davy Jones.
- Davy Jones.

1459
00:48:51,530 --> 00:48:52,800
The noodles are going in.

1460
00:48:53,630 --> 00:48:55,030
(He slurps up the noodles.)

1461
00:48:55,030 --> 00:48:56,930
Was it tasty? Was it cold?

1462
00:48:56,930 --> 00:48:57,970
Was it cold?

1463
00:48:58,090 --> 00:48:59,670
I need to eat.

1464
00:48:59,800 --> 00:49:01,030
Let's go.

1465
00:49:01,860 --> 00:49:03,130
That was tasty.

1466
00:49:03,130 --> 00:49:06,030
For the next mission,
we will play Don't Make a Sound,

1467
00:49:06,030 --> 00:49:07,900
which is a game
you are familiar with.

1468
00:49:07,900 --> 00:49:09,110
Don't Make a Sound?

1469
00:49:09,110 --> 00:49:13,320
The member who makes
the least amount of sound wins.

1470
00:49:13,320 --> 00:49:14,340
If you make a sound,

1471
00:49:14,340 --> 00:49:16,150
you will be dragged
behind the folding screen...

1472
00:49:16,150 --> 00:49:18,590
and receive a penalty makeup
before you come back.

1473
00:49:19,050 --> 00:49:21,420
- We have to hold in laughter.
- That's right.

1474
00:49:21,420 --> 00:49:24,760
The game will go on for 15 minutes.

1475
00:49:24,760 --> 00:49:26,760
- Okay.
- I laugh too much.

1476
00:49:26,860 --> 00:49:28,720
I can't hold in laughter.

1477
00:49:28,720 --> 00:49:31,430
Get ready. Set, go.

1478
00:49:31,430 --> 00:49:32,670
(The mission
of the 15-minute silence starts.)

1479
00:49:36,030 --> 00:49:37,630
(They glance over at each other.)

1480
00:49:38,010 --> 00:49:40,300
(I will look up funny photos.)

1481
00:49:40,470 --> 00:49:42,240
(What is he doing?)

1482
00:49:44,400 --> 00:49:46,880
(The war begins
in less than 10 seconds.)

1483
00:49:47,220 --> 00:49:49,490
(Kwang Soo suppresses his laughter
and attacks with his long legs.)

1484
00:49:49,490 --> 00:49:51,090
(I don't care who wins.)

1485
00:49:51,380 --> 00:49:53,680
(Laughing)

1486
00:49:53,680 --> 00:49:56,050
(Jae Suk becomes the 1st one
to go to the makeup room.)

1487
00:49:56,050 --> 00:49:57,260
(That was close.)

1488
00:49:57,990 --> 00:50:00,050
- Jae Suk is out.
- I mean...

1489
00:50:00,050 --> 00:50:02,570
(Kwang Soo gets knocked out
in 0.1 seconds.)

1490
00:50:03,360 --> 00:50:05,360
Kwang Soo, please go on in as well.

1491
00:50:05,360 --> 00:50:06,360
(Kwang Soo and Jae Suk
go into the makeup room.)

1492
00:50:06,360 --> 00:50:07,990
Kwang Soo, why did you...

1493
00:50:08,030 --> 00:50:10,110
Who was it?
It didn't tickle. It hurt.

1494
00:50:10,110 --> 00:50:11,200
For goodness' sake.

1495
00:50:11,200 --> 00:50:13,110
(The two troublemakers
are out momentarily.)

1496
00:50:13,680 --> 00:50:15,880
(They came to the makeup room
faster than they expected.)

1497
00:50:16,280 --> 00:50:18,650
(Meanwhile, Haha shows something.)

1498
00:50:20,650 --> 00:50:23,240
Stop it. Stop it.

1499
00:50:23,240 --> 00:50:25,380
(It's So Min as Yondu.)

1500
00:50:25,380 --> 00:50:27,680
(It's highly likely that she will be
the Character of 2019.)

1501
00:50:27,680 --> 00:50:29,590
(She holds in her laughter.)

1502
00:50:30,590 --> 00:50:33,150
(The war of memes begin.)

1503
00:50:34,430 --> 00:50:36,820
(It's a synthesized photo
of Ji Hyo and Se Chan.)

1504
00:50:36,820 --> 00:50:38,260
(Jong Kook averts his eyes.)

1505
00:50:42,400 --> 00:50:44,570
(Laughing)

1506
00:50:44,740 --> 00:50:47,180
(What did So Min see?)

1507
00:50:47,180 --> 00:50:48,680
(Walking)

1508
00:50:48,680 --> 00:50:50,880
(The two members
from the netherworld...)

1509
00:50:50,880 --> 00:50:53,180
(appear with a dark aura.)

1510
00:50:53,180 --> 00:50:55,590
(Chic and confident)

1511
00:50:56,280 --> 00:50:59,010
(Gosh, I can't laugh!)

1512
00:50:59,010 --> 00:51:00,950
(Walking is enough
to make their presence known.)

1513
00:51:00,950 --> 00:51:04,720
Jae Suk's makeup is manageable,
but Kwang Soo's makeup isn't.

1514
00:51:05,900 --> 00:51:09,720
Is he Yondu? Is he Yondu?

1515
00:51:10,070 --> 00:51:11,200
So Min.

1516
00:51:11,200 --> 00:51:12,200
(Serious)

1517
00:51:12,200 --> 00:51:14,670
(Kwang Soo's looks are perfect
for this kind of a game.)

1518
00:51:15,860 --> 00:51:16,860
(Pinching)

1519
00:51:17,470 --> 00:51:19,110
(This is interesting.)

1520
00:51:21,280 --> 00:51:22,780
(He is as calm as ever.)

1521
00:51:22,780 --> 00:51:24,300
(Are you done?)

1522
00:51:25,340 --> 00:51:27,150
(Kwang Soo helps.)

1523
00:51:27,280 --> 00:51:28,590
(Se Chan is out.)

1524
00:51:28,590 --> 00:51:29,780
Se Chan.

1525
00:51:29,780 --> 00:51:31,740
(The collaboration
between strength and funny looks)

1526
00:51:31,740 --> 00:51:34,180
Okay. Okay.

1527
00:51:36,360 --> 00:51:37,760
(Laughing)

1528
00:51:37,760 --> 00:51:39,150
Kwang Soo.

1529
00:51:39,300 --> 00:51:42,260
(Kwang Soo couldn't stand
his bare face in the morning.)

1530
00:51:42,260 --> 00:51:43,760
(He gets sent back
to the makeup room.)

1531
00:51:43,760 --> 00:51:45,400
Jong Kook is too strong.

1532
00:51:46,630 --> 00:51:48,360
What made you laugh?

1533
00:51:48,610 --> 00:51:50,570
(Laughing)

1534
00:51:51,110 --> 00:51:54,300
Make me look as funny as him.

1535
00:51:54,510 --> 00:51:56,510
Make me look the same.

1536
00:51:59,240 --> 00:52:01,280
(Laughing)

1537
00:52:03,380 --> 00:52:05,880
(A sexy man, Suk Jin appears.)

1538
00:52:05,880 --> 00:52:07,320
(When Suk Jin appears
with an upturned nose,)

1539
00:52:07,320 --> 00:52:09,490
(Ji Hyo falters.)

1540
00:52:10,320 --> 00:52:12,590
(Everyone wants a photo.)

1541
00:52:12,590 --> 00:52:14,490
(He is pretending to be cool.)

1542
00:52:15,760 --> 00:52:17,360
(Laughing)

1543
00:52:17,360 --> 00:52:18,430
Suk Jin.

1544
00:52:18,970 --> 00:52:20,030
(He is out
thanks to his own photo.)

1545
00:52:20,030 --> 00:52:21,590
I can't believe them.

1546
00:52:22,170 --> 00:52:23,760
(He briefly enjoys the fresh air...)

1547
00:52:23,760 --> 00:52:24,930
(before he reunites with his friends
back in the makeup room.)

1548
00:52:25,680 --> 00:52:26,740
Why are you here?

1549
00:52:26,740 --> 00:52:28,280
Jong Kook will win again.

1550
00:52:28,280 --> 00:52:29,280
Why isn't Jong Kook here?

1551
00:52:29,280 --> 00:52:30,280
Jong Kook has to make a sound.

1552
00:52:30,280 --> 00:52:32,420
- Let's join forces.
- Seriously. Let's work together.

1553
00:52:32,420 --> 00:52:34,220
Let's take Jong Kook down.

1554
00:52:34,970 --> 00:52:36,050
Okay.

1555
00:52:36,050 --> 00:52:37,780
(Jong Kook, look at this photo
of Suk Jin in his 20s.)

1556
00:52:37,780 --> 00:52:39,760
(He doesn't budge.)

1557
00:52:40,780 --> 00:52:41,780
(Kicking)

1558
00:52:42,880 --> 00:52:44,680
(Come on and laugh.)

1559
00:52:44,680 --> 00:52:46,400
(Did you just kick me?)

1560
00:52:46,530 --> 00:52:47,530
(Reaching)

1561
00:52:48,200 --> 00:52:49,430
(Falling down)

1562
00:52:49,430 --> 00:52:50,570
(Ouch.)

1563
00:52:53,090 --> 00:52:54,570
(She falls down on her own.)

1564
00:52:54,570 --> 00:52:56,260
(She really is in pain.)

1565
00:52:57,130 --> 00:52:59,200
(I didn't even touch her!)

1566
00:53:00,630 --> 00:53:01,970
My knee.

1567
00:53:01,970 --> 00:53:03,010
(The victory is Jong Kook's
once again.)

1568
00:53:03,010 --> 00:53:04,150
As for Jong Kook...

1569
00:53:04,510 --> 00:53:06,380
What do you want to do?

1570
00:53:06,650 --> 00:53:09,380
(Jong Kook said
he can't hold in laughter.)

1571
00:53:09,380 --> 00:53:11,050
(At that moment,)

1572
00:53:11,050 --> 00:53:12,950
(the man with 1,000 faces appear.)

1573
00:53:12,950 --> 00:53:15,380
(Lee Kwang Soo, the prince of Asia)

1574
00:53:15,780 --> 00:53:17,320
(Jong Kook suppresses laughter.)

1575
00:53:17,680 --> 00:53:19,900
(His gaze is intense.)

1576
00:53:19,900 --> 00:53:21,590
(Why are you taking a photo of me?)

1577
00:53:22,130 --> 00:53:24,720
(Not even Kwang Soo's face
can make Jong Kook laugh.)

1578
00:53:24,720 --> 00:53:26,860
(Jong Kook, look here.)

1579
00:53:29,110 --> 00:53:31,260
(Laughing)

1580
00:53:31,930 --> 00:53:33,110
(On Se Chan's big belly...)

1581
00:53:33,110 --> 00:53:34,970
(is a man's face.)

1582
00:53:34,970 --> 00:53:36,780
(Is that a cup of coffee?)

1583
00:53:39,050 --> 00:53:41,470
(Drinking)

1584
00:53:41,470 --> 00:53:43,280
(Jong Kook withstands
the attacks...)

1585
00:53:43,280 --> 00:53:44,880
(from Se Chan and Kwang Soo.)

1586
00:53:44,880 --> 00:53:46,490
I really can't do this.

1587
00:53:46,490 --> 00:53:48,420
Se Chan's belly is drinking.

1588
00:53:48,680 --> 00:53:50,150
(So Min is out, not Jong Kook.)

1589
00:53:50,150 --> 00:53:51,680
(Laughing)

1590
00:53:51,990 --> 00:53:53,490
(Why are you laughing?)

1591
00:53:53,490 --> 00:53:54,590
(Instead of making Jong Kook laugh,)

1592
00:53:54,590 --> 00:53:57,360
(they make each other laugh.)

1593
00:53:57,360 --> 00:53:58,670
Isn't this funny?

1594
00:53:59,170 --> 00:54:01,400
(Relaxed)

1595
00:54:01,400 --> 00:54:03,670
(He should laugh by now.)

1596
00:54:04,110 --> 00:54:05,780
(Jong Kook!)

1597
00:54:07,200 --> 00:54:09,680
(Mini-So Min appears.)

1598
00:54:10,050 --> 00:54:12,470
(Jong Kook finally faces a crisis.)

1599
00:54:12,470 --> 00:54:15,070
(Do you have to go this far?)

1600
00:54:15,070 --> 00:54:17,220
(Mini-So Min makes an effort.)

1601
00:54:17,220 --> 00:54:19,880
(Strange laughter is heard.)

1602
00:54:21,860 --> 00:54:24,860
(Laughing in a weird way)

1603
00:54:24,860 --> 00:54:26,490
(This is driving me crazy.)

1604
00:54:26,490 --> 00:54:27,820
What is he doing?

1605
00:54:29,400 --> 00:54:31,030
(Shouting)

1606
00:54:32,090 --> 00:54:34,260
(Jae Suk's touch
makes Kwang Soo come to his senses.)

1607
00:54:34,260 --> 00:54:35,340
Kwang Soo.

1608
00:54:36,110 --> 00:54:38,430
Jong Kook is the only one...

1609
00:54:39,280 --> 00:54:41,110
What are you doing?

1610
00:54:41,800 --> 00:54:43,180
(He hates it.)

1611
00:54:43,280 --> 00:54:46,010
Did she have to go that far?

1612
00:54:46,010 --> 00:54:47,680
What is wrong with her?

1613
00:54:47,680 --> 00:54:48,880
(I really want to make him laugh.)

1614
00:54:49,380 --> 00:54:51,110
(Thinking)

1615
00:54:52,180 --> 00:54:54,010
(Whispering)

1616
00:54:54,880 --> 00:54:55,880
(A knife)

1617
00:54:56,030 --> 00:54:58,030
What? What?

1618
00:54:59,860 --> 00:55:01,760
Ji Hyo told me to take out a knife.

1619
00:55:01,760 --> 00:55:03,220
(Did you hear that?)

1620
00:55:03,820 --> 00:55:05,360
(How will you make Jong Kook laugh
with that?)

1621
00:55:05,360 --> 00:55:06,800
She asked me for a knife.

1622
00:55:06,840 --> 00:55:08,200
(Didn't you laugh?)

1623
00:55:08,200 --> 00:55:10,740
She asked me for a knife.

1624
00:55:10,740 --> 00:55:12,930
(A human weapon quietly appears.)

1625
00:55:12,930 --> 00:55:14,200
What is that?

1626
00:55:14,200 --> 00:55:16,200
(His target is Jong Kook.)

1627
00:55:16,470 --> 00:55:17,780
(Stifling her laughter)

1628
00:55:18,340 --> 00:55:19,380
(Since Ji Hyo is about to laugh,)

1629
00:55:19,380 --> 00:55:21,650
(he changes his target.)

1630
00:55:22,510 --> 00:55:23,740
How scary!

1631
00:55:24,150 --> 00:55:26,010
(She was caught off guard.)

1632
00:55:26,010 --> 00:55:27,860
(Dancing)

1633
00:55:28,860 --> 00:55:30,430
(The outdated dance moves...)

1634
00:55:30,430 --> 00:55:32,900
(makes Jong Kook turn frigid.)

1635
00:55:34,260 --> 00:55:36,360
How do I make Jong Kook laugh?

1636
00:55:36,900 --> 00:55:39,490
- Just you wait, Jong Kook.
- How do I make Jong Kook laugh?

1637
00:55:39,490 --> 00:55:42,240
Jong Kook almost laughed,
but he caught himself at the end.

1638
00:55:42,470 --> 00:55:44,860
(I hope there is something
to laugh about.)

1639
00:55:48,840 --> 00:55:51,150
(I am coming through.)

1640
00:55:51,450 --> 00:55:53,680
(I can hold back my laughter.)

1641
00:55:54,070 --> 00:55:56,240
(Haha, bring me water.)

1642
00:55:56,990 --> 00:55:59,420
(They prepared a skit.)

1643
00:56:02,220 --> 00:56:03,780
(What?)

1644
00:56:03,780 --> 00:56:05,260
(Chuckling)

1645
00:56:05,260 --> 00:56:08,050
(Jong Kook finally laughed.)

1646
00:56:08,400 --> 00:56:09,590
For goodness' sake.

1647
00:56:09,590 --> 00:56:10,590
(Without a straw,)

1648
00:56:10,590 --> 00:56:13,260
(Haha pours water
on Se Chan's belly.)

1649
00:56:14,700 --> 00:56:16,340
What are you doing?

1650
00:56:17,070 --> 00:56:19,010
What is this?

1651
00:56:20,240 --> 00:56:21,240
(Thanks to Se Chan,
Jong Kook goes to the makeup room.)

1652
00:56:21,240 --> 00:56:22,610
What are you doing?

1653
00:56:22,780 --> 00:56:24,380
(What?)

1654
00:56:26,280 --> 00:56:27,720
(Standing)

1655
00:56:33,110 --> 00:56:36,280
(Laughing)

1656
00:56:36,590 --> 00:56:37,680
My goodness.

1657
00:56:37,680 --> 00:56:39,130
(The laughing machine
is malfunctioning again.)

1658
00:56:39,490 --> 00:56:41,550
Gosh, I am sorry.

1659
00:56:41,590 --> 00:56:43,930
(He pays attention to the details.)

1660
00:56:43,930 --> 00:56:45,070
My goodness.

1661
00:56:45,070 --> 00:56:48,090
(Everyone except for Kwang Soo
goes to the makeup room.)

1662
00:56:48,090 --> 00:56:49,110
For goodness' sake.

1663
00:56:50,170 --> 00:56:51,170
Hey!

1664
00:56:51,170 --> 00:56:52,180
(Beanpole!)

1665
00:56:53,680 --> 00:56:55,380
(The two great figures...)

1666
00:56:55,380 --> 00:56:57,840
(finally meet.)

1667
00:56:59,470 --> 00:57:02,280
(The tension is growing...)

1668
00:57:02,280 --> 00:57:05,240
(between the two lookers.)

1669
00:57:07,860 --> 00:57:10,260
(Neck-and-neck)

1670
00:57:10,490 --> 00:57:13,050
(Who will be the winner
between them?)

1671
00:57:13,050 --> 00:57:14,760
(Shouting)

1672
00:57:14,900 --> 00:57:17,300
(Jae Suk loses.)

1673
00:57:18,090 --> 00:57:20,570
(I am the looker of this area.)

1674
00:57:20,570 --> 00:57:23,260
(Thanks to Haha's kick of justice,
Jae Suk is out.)

1675
00:57:23,260 --> 00:57:24,610
The game will end in five minutes.

1676
00:57:24,970 --> 00:57:26,470
(Let's hold out for 5 minutes!)

1677
00:57:27,630 --> 00:57:29,380
(He gets something.)

1678
00:57:30,740 --> 00:57:33,680
(Haha brings something.)

1679
00:57:34,780 --> 00:57:37,090
(Is that a straw?)

1680
00:57:37,920 --> 00:57:39,820
It's the one that was in
Se Chan's belly button.

1681
00:57:41,320 --> 00:57:44,490
(The straw gets recycled
in an unexpected way.)

1682
00:57:45,650 --> 00:57:47,860
(Shocked)

1683
00:57:49,220 --> 00:57:50,260
Are you serious?

1684
00:57:50,700 --> 00:57:52,570
(It's the same straw.)

1685
00:57:53,740 --> 00:57:55,570
(When the secret
behind the straw gets revealed,)

1686
00:57:55,570 --> 00:57:58,360
(Jong Kook enters.)

1687
00:57:58,360 --> 00:57:59,930
(He has no thoughts.)

1688
00:58:00,510 --> 00:58:02,380
(I have a good idea.)

1689
00:58:03,180 --> 00:58:05,150
(He gets up...)

1690
00:58:05,150 --> 00:58:07,650
(and delivers the straw.)

1691
00:58:07,650 --> 00:58:10,050
(What is he doing?)

1692
00:58:11,050 --> 00:58:12,880
It's the one that was in
Se Chan's belly button.

1693
00:58:15,590 --> 00:58:16,780
It went into Se Chan's belly button.

1694
00:58:16,780 --> 00:58:20,260
(The secret behind the salty taste
gets revealed.)

1695
00:58:20,650 --> 00:58:22,900
(Haha bursts out laughing.)

1696
00:58:23,470 --> 00:58:24,990
Three minutes remain.

1697
00:58:25,590 --> 00:58:26,670
(With 3 minutes remaining,)

1698
00:58:26,670 --> 00:58:29,130
(Jong Kook is leading
because he made a noise once.)

1699
00:58:29,130 --> 00:58:31,740
There is only one thing
that can make Jong Kook laugh.

1700
00:58:31,760 --> 00:58:32,780
What is it?

1701
00:58:32,780 --> 00:58:34,930
(They prepare a secret weapon.)

1702
00:58:35,550 --> 00:58:37,650
(Meanwhile, So Min...)

1703
00:58:37,650 --> 00:58:40,380
(attacks with Mini-So Min
for the 3rd time.)

1704
00:58:40,920 --> 00:58:43,150
(It's saying something.)

1705
00:58:44,220 --> 00:58:46,380
(Stop it, So Min!)

1706
00:58:48,360 --> 00:58:50,050
(While So Min buys time
with Mini-So Min,)

1707
00:58:50,050 --> 00:58:52,650
(the secret weapon gets ready.)

1708
00:58:53,050 --> 00:58:54,090
All right.

1709
00:58:54,700 --> 00:58:58,260
(What? This face is...)

1710
00:58:58,320 --> 00:58:59,400
My goodness.

1711
00:58:59,400 --> 00:59:01,740
(Kwang Soo did a similar makeup
1 year ago in the UK.)

1712
00:59:01,740 --> 00:59:05,510
(But he showed up
after the game ended.)

1713
00:59:06,630 --> 00:59:08,880
(Blue Monster)

1714
00:59:08,880 --> 00:59:11,110
(Why is the game over?)

1715
00:59:11,110 --> 00:59:14,010
(He couldn't make full use
of his special attack.)

1716
00:59:14,240 --> 00:59:17,680
(Blue Monster will finally complete
his mission today.)

1717
00:59:17,680 --> 00:59:19,280
(Whistling)

1718
00:59:19,280 --> 00:59:20,280
Time's up.

1719
00:59:20,680 --> 00:59:21,680
Is it over?

1720
00:59:22,530 --> 00:59:24,650
(His eyes go wide.)

1721
00:59:24,650 --> 00:59:26,900
(Is it over?)

1722
00:59:28,430 --> 00:59:30,220
- Is it over again?
- It's over.

1723
00:59:30,470 --> 00:59:31,490
(Today as well,)

1724
00:59:31,490 --> 00:59:33,860
(Kwang Soo couldn't make full use
of his special attack.)

1725
00:59:34,240 --> 00:59:35,570
You only had a minute left.

1726
00:59:35,570 --> 00:59:36,740
You should have blown...

1727
00:59:36,930 --> 00:59:38,240
the whistle earlier.

1728
00:59:38,240 --> 00:59:39,400
(Furious)

1729
00:59:39,400 --> 00:59:41,680
- He was almost done too.
- But...

1730
00:59:41,680 --> 00:59:44,150
(Mission 2 is over before
Kwang Soo becomes an Avatar.)

1731
00:59:44,150 --> 00:59:46,110
The winner of
Don't Make a Sound is...

1732
00:59:46,110 --> 00:59:48,240
Jong Kook who laughed only once.

1733
00:59:48,240 --> 00:59:49,490
(Kim Jong Kook wins.)

1734
00:59:49,490 --> 00:59:50,590
Is it Jong Kook again?

1735
00:59:50,590 --> 00:59:52,320
I had my mind open.

1736
00:59:52,880 --> 00:59:54,650
I'll pick another card.

1737
00:59:54,720 --> 00:59:56,180
- Pick another card.
- Okay.

1738
00:59:56,430 --> 00:59:58,380
- Get a dud.
- Someone else eating looks good.

1739
00:59:58,380 --> 01:00:00,260
- Is there a dud?
- There is.

1740
01:00:00,260 --> 01:00:01,530
Goodness.

1741
01:00:01,630 --> 01:00:03,300
(Last time, Jong Kook's pick
only benefited the others.)

1742
01:00:03,300 --> 01:00:05,170
I also want dried yellow corvina.

1743
01:00:05,400 --> 01:00:06,860
(Which card did he pick this time?)

1744
01:00:06,860 --> 01:00:08,860
- Which one is it?
- I hope he'll get to eat.

1745
01:00:09,200 --> 01:00:12,070
(Which card did Jong Kook pick?)

1746
01:00:14,030 --> 01:00:15,110
It's a dud.

1747
01:00:15,110 --> 01:00:16,700
(Darn it, it's a dud.)

1748
01:00:16,700 --> 01:00:18,450
(Dud)

1749
01:00:18,650 --> 01:00:20,920
(It's a dud this time.)

1750
01:00:20,920 --> 01:00:22,740
- That's great.
- Nice.

1751
01:00:22,740 --> 01:00:24,220
(He wins nothing.)

1752
01:00:24,220 --> 01:00:25,420
We have a chance.

1753
01:00:25,420 --> 01:00:26,490
It'll be a party.

1754
01:00:26,490 --> 01:00:27,720
Why am I so unlucky today?

1755
01:00:28,110 --> 01:00:29,930
(Jong Kook is very unlucky today.)

1756
01:00:29,930 --> 01:00:31,150
I'm not lucky at all.

1757
01:00:31,150 --> 01:00:32,400
We're defending ourselves well.

1758
01:00:32,400 --> 01:00:33,650
(Haha is in first place
without doing anything.)

1759
01:00:33,650 --> 01:00:36,530
- Give us a worthwhile game to play.
- That's right.

1760
01:00:37,590 --> 01:00:40,670
Next mission is called
I'm King of Common Sense Too.

1761
01:00:41,070 --> 01:00:42,860
Jae Suk has good common sense.

1762
01:00:42,930 --> 01:00:43,970
Is it common sense?

1763
01:00:44,010 --> 01:00:45,260
I'm doomed.

1764
01:00:45,360 --> 01:00:46,530
This is for me.

1765
01:00:46,530 --> 01:00:48,130
It'll be a team competition.

1766
01:00:48,130 --> 01:00:50,840
To decide the order. All the members
except for the first will go...

1767
01:00:50,840 --> 01:00:52,340
wear headphones playing music.

1768
01:00:52,340 --> 01:00:54,610
After looking at the word
given by the staff,

1769
01:00:54,610 --> 01:00:55,990
you will be given 10 seconds...

1770
01:00:55,990 --> 01:00:58,220
to explain it
to the member beside you.

1771
01:00:58,340 --> 01:01:00,280
The team to correctly guess
the most wins.

1772
01:01:00,920 --> 01:01:02,180
- This sounds good.
- I see.

1773
01:01:02,380 --> 01:01:03,530
(They need to understand
the given word.)

1774
01:01:03,530 --> 01:01:04,990
We have to express ourselves well.

1775
01:01:05,130 --> 01:01:07,450
I hope I get on a good team.

1776
01:01:07,530 --> 01:01:09,130
You're doomed if I'm on your team.

1777
01:01:09,470 --> 01:01:12,320
It's over if you, Ji Hyo,
and Haha are on the same team.

1778
01:01:12,530 --> 01:01:13,590
Haha?

1779
01:01:13,590 --> 01:01:14,840
(Haha, Se Chan, and Ji Hyo)

1780
01:01:14,930 --> 01:01:16,030
We must avoid those three.

1781
01:01:16,840 --> 01:01:17,900
All right.

1782
01:01:17,900 --> 01:01:19,840
(They determine the teams
by picking spoons.)

1783
01:01:20,400 --> 01:01:21,970
- I want to be on your team.
- Here you go.

1784
01:01:22,570 --> 01:01:23,700
I want to be on your team.

1785
01:01:24,010 --> 01:01:25,470
Let's start with So Min.

1786
01:01:25,650 --> 01:01:26,740
1, 2.

1787
01:01:27,050 --> 01:01:28,180
- Red.
- Red.

1788
01:01:28,180 --> 01:01:29,590
(So Min, Kwang Soo, Jong Kook,
and Haha)

1789
01:01:29,590 --> 01:01:30,780
(They're on the same team.)

1790
01:01:30,780 --> 01:01:32,380
- Mine is blue.
- Blue.

1791
01:01:32,380 --> 01:01:34,110
- Blue.
- Blue.

1792
01:01:34,110 --> 01:01:35,450
Okay.

1793
01:01:35,990 --> 01:01:37,650
- Can you be excited?
- Hey.

1794
01:01:37,650 --> 01:01:39,300
- Can you please be excited?
- How is this possible?

1795
01:01:39,300 --> 01:01:41,050
She and I don't know anything.

1796
01:01:41,550 --> 01:01:43,260
Our team isn't bad.

1797
01:01:43,260 --> 01:01:44,930
- Wait a minute.
- It isn't bad.

1798
01:01:44,930 --> 01:01:46,470
- We're expressive.
- It'll be worth to play.

1799
01:01:46,740 --> 01:01:47,860
We'll be fine if we get good words.

1800
01:01:47,860 --> 01:01:50,130
- Both teams are similar.
- I think you're right.

1801
01:01:50,130 --> 01:01:51,840
We aren't similar.

1802
01:01:51,840 --> 01:01:53,200
We have two who don't know anything.

1803
01:01:53,680 --> 01:01:55,200
(Jae Suk, Suk Jin, Ji Hyo,
and Se Chan start first.)

1804
01:01:55,200 --> 01:01:56,840
(I'm King of Common Sense Too)

1805
01:01:57,550 --> 01:01:59,280
(She can't hear anything at all.)

1806
01:01:59,680 --> 01:02:00,820
Shall I go? Get ready.

1807
01:02:00,820 --> 01:02:01,880
(The first question starts.)

1808
01:02:01,880 --> 01:02:03,010
Start.

1809
01:02:04,010 --> 01:02:07,050
(Roll-Over)

1810
01:02:07,450 --> 01:02:09,550
(What's this?
He's never seen it before.)

1811
01:02:09,760 --> 01:02:11,050
You can do it.

1812
01:02:11,050 --> 01:02:12,550
(Deferring payment...)

1813
01:02:12,550 --> 01:02:13,990
(or renegotiating terms
of an agreement)

1814
01:02:13,990 --> 01:02:15,800
It's a famous game.

1815
01:02:15,930 --> 01:02:17,320
It starts with an L.

1816
01:02:17,320 --> 01:02:19,200
- Yes, I know.
- You know it, right?

1817
01:02:19,200 --> 01:02:21,530
- However the game ended.
- It ended?

1818
01:02:21,530 --> 01:02:22,670
It has three syllables.

1819
01:02:22,800 --> 01:02:25,030
It's when the game ends.

1820
01:02:25,030 --> 01:02:27,340
(He wants to explain
that the game is over.)

1821
01:02:27,340 --> 01:02:28,380
Out.

1822
01:02:28,380 --> 01:02:29,470
- Explain to the next person.
- Out.

1823
01:02:29,610 --> 01:02:31,010
(Why is it out?)

1824
01:02:31,950 --> 01:02:33,550
- Didn't I explain it enough?
- I don't know.

1825
01:02:34,420 --> 01:02:36,180
(They already smell failure.)

1826
01:02:36,180 --> 01:02:38,050
It's a type of a game.

1827
01:02:38,180 --> 01:02:41,180
It's a game that's popular
these days.

1828
01:02:41,180 --> 01:02:43,650
Do you know Faker?
It's a game that Faker plays.

1829
01:02:43,650 --> 01:02:44,990
The first word is that game.

1830
01:02:44,990 --> 01:02:46,550
The last word is when the game ends.

1831
01:02:46,630 --> 01:02:47,700
It's the last two words.

1832
01:02:47,700 --> 01:02:50,200
(Faker? The last two words?)

1833
01:02:51,400 --> 01:02:52,670
"Game out"?

1834
01:02:52,670 --> 01:02:54,030
(When did I say "out"?)

1835
01:02:54,760 --> 01:02:56,610
(Faker, the last two words)

1836
01:02:56,970 --> 01:02:58,430
It's a game that Faker plays.

1837
01:02:59,130 --> 01:03:00,610
However,

1838
01:03:00,610 --> 01:03:01,930
the first word is excluded.

1839
01:03:01,930 --> 01:03:04,900
(She fails to deliver it.)

1840
01:03:05,380 --> 01:03:06,680
When did I say that?

1841
01:03:06,680 --> 01:03:07,720
(She delivers a wrong message.)

1842
01:03:07,720 --> 01:03:09,920
- When did I say that?
- Did he say that?

1843
01:03:10,280 --> 01:03:11,610
Who said such a thing?

1844
01:03:11,780 --> 01:03:13,990
Is there a ghost here?

1845
01:03:14,150 --> 01:03:16,050
Does Faker play a game called
"League of Legends"?

1846
01:03:16,050 --> 01:03:18,680
The first word disappeared.
It's the last word.

1847
01:03:19,530 --> 01:03:20,650
(What disappeared?)

1848
01:03:20,650 --> 01:03:21,700
"Disappear"?

1849
01:03:22,150 --> 01:03:23,260
When did it disappear?

1850
01:03:23,490 --> 01:03:24,490
Legend.

1851
01:03:25,070 --> 01:03:26,800
- What?
- What are you talking about?

1852
01:03:27,430 --> 01:03:28,990
(Wasn't that right?)

1853
01:03:28,990 --> 01:03:30,200
- What disappeared?
- That was right.

1854
01:03:30,200 --> 01:03:31,570
- It is "League of Legends".
- Hey.

1855
01:03:31,570 --> 01:03:33,110
- It was "roll".
- That's right.

1856
01:03:33,400 --> 01:03:34,510
What's the answer?

1857
01:03:34,510 --> 01:03:36,570
"Roll-Over".

1858
01:03:36,700 --> 01:03:38,780
(They fail their first attempt.)

1859
01:03:38,780 --> 01:03:40,240
Here we go again.

1860
01:03:41,050 --> 01:03:42,240
Get ready, set, go.

1861
01:03:42,240 --> 01:03:44,650
(Southwest Effect)

1862
01:03:44,840 --> 01:03:48,110
(The effect of an increase
in customers as prices fall)

1863
01:03:48,110 --> 01:03:50,180
- It's easy to explain.
- It's a type of effect.

1864
01:03:50,280 --> 01:03:51,880
In American rap,

1865
01:03:51,990 --> 01:03:53,700
they say east or west.

1866
01:03:53,820 --> 01:03:55,220
They say things like that.

1867
01:03:55,220 --> 01:03:56,800
It's rap, but is it also an effect?

1868
01:03:56,800 --> 01:03:58,820
He didn't have to say it in English.

1869
01:03:59,340 --> 01:04:00,470
- Right.
- I know.

1870
01:04:00,930 --> 01:04:03,510
- There's a neighborhood in the US.
- Yes.

1871
01:04:03,510 --> 01:04:05,740
- It's in the south.
- Harlem? South?

1872
01:04:05,740 --> 01:04:07,530
It's a southern neighborhood effect.

1873
01:04:07,530 --> 01:04:08,930
- Southern...
- Neighborhood effect.

1874
01:04:08,930 --> 01:04:10,650
- Southern neighborhood.
- It's in the southern direction.

1875
01:04:10,650 --> 01:04:12,920
It's rap from a foreign country.

1876
01:04:12,920 --> 01:04:15,340
It's an effect of
southern neighborhood rapping.

1877
01:04:15,950 --> 01:04:17,720
(What do you mean?)

1878
01:04:17,880 --> 01:04:20,650
It's not rap
from a southern neighborhood.

1879
01:04:20,760 --> 01:04:22,880
You can't keep talking.

1880
01:04:24,320 --> 01:04:25,490
(An effect of
southern neighborhood rapping?)

1881
01:04:25,490 --> 01:04:26,530
- Jae Suk.
- What?

1882
01:04:26,530 --> 01:04:29,430
It's a person who raps
in a southern neighborhood.

1883
01:04:29,800 --> 01:04:31,030
There's an effect.

1884
01:04:31,030 --> 01:04:32,700
(An effect of a person?)

1885
01:04:33,700 --> 01:04:34,860
(They get farther away
from the answer.)

1886
01:04:34,860 --> 01:04:36,470
- Ji Hyo gets scarier.
- A person?

1887
01:04:36,610 --> 01:04:38,360
- There's no person.
- Hey!

1888
01:04:38,510 --> 01:04:40,900
- Do you have a hearing problem?
- No.

1889
01:04:41,010 --> 01:04:43,240
- Listen.
- What's wrong with her hearing?

1890
01:04:43,240 --> 01:04:45,050
- How can I believe you?
- There's an effect...

1891
01:04:45,050 --> 01:04:47,150
- of a person who raps in the south.
- South.

1892
01:04:47,740 --> 01:04:50,110
(Jae Suk gets "south" correctly.)

1893
01:04:50,110 --> 01:04:51,380
South rap.

1894
01:04:52,010 --> 01:04:53,050
Effect.

1895
01:04:53,050 --> 01:04:55,720
(South rap effect is wrong.)

1896
01:04:55,720 --> 01:04:57,090
I answered based on what she said.

1897
01:04:57,260 --> 01:04:59,400
There's an effect
of rapping in the south.

1898
01:04:59,400 --> 01:05:00,820
It's southwest effect.

1899
01:05:00,820 --> 01:05:02,300
This is absurd.

1900
01:05:02,300 --> 01:05:03,360
Can we change the order?

1901
01:05:03,860 --> 01:05:05,860
- Let's change. It's hard.
- How could you...

1902
01:05:05,990 --> 01:05:07,170
- Goodness.
- Jae Suk.

1903
01:05:08,400 --> 01:05:10,510
Here we go. 1, 2, 3.

1904
01:05:10,510 --> 01:05:12,630
(Galapagos Syndrome)

1905
01:05:12,630 --> 01:05:13,800
(A globally available product
sold only in its local country)

1906
01:05:13,800 --> 01:05:14,880
This is so difficult.

1907
01:05:14,880 --> 01:05:16,380
(It also refers to
something isolated...)

1908
01:05:16,380 --> 01:05:17,950
(due to a lack of communication
with outside countries.)

1909
01:05:17,950 --> 01:05:19,570
- This is what it is.
- Yes?

1910
01:05:20,050 --> 01:05:22,720
- It's becoming alone and lonely.
- "Alone and lonely"?

1911
01:05:22,720 --> 01:05:25,780
- There's an island.
- An island?

1912
01:05:25,780 --> 01:05:27,420
(He's the first
to explain properly.)

1913
01:05:27,420 --> 01:05:29,590
- Its name is 5 syllables.
- 5-syllable name of an island.

1914
01:05:29,590 --> 01:05:31,680
- Is it becoming alone and lonely?
- Yes.

1915
01:05:32,320 --> 01:05:33,990
Jae Suk must know what it means.

1916
01:05:35,260 --> 01:05:37,900
It gets separated from the outside
and becomes an island.

1917
01:05:37,970 --> 01:05:39,900
- It becomes lonely.
- A lonely island?

1918
01:05:39,900 --> 01:05:42,470
It's in isolation due to
the separation from the outside.

1919
01:05:42,840 --> 01:05:45,240
- "Separation from the outside".
- It's that type of syndrome.

1920
01:05:45,240 --> 01:05:46,970
It's an island.

1921
01:05:46,970 --> 01:05:48,510
(Galapagos Syndrome)

1922
01:05:48,510 --> 01:05:49,880
It's where lonely people go.

1923
01:05:51,680 --> 01:05:53,450
(They aren't going anywhere.)

1924
01:05:53,450 --> 01:05:55,050
Lonely people...

1925
01:05:55,470 --> 01:05:56,880
That's not right.

1926
01:05:56,990 --> 01:05:58,220
Five... What I mean is...

1927
01:05:58,220 --> 01:06:00,010
There are five.

1928
01:06:00,010 --> 01:06:02,090
It's where lonely people go.

1929
01:06:02,090 --> 01:06:03,630
The name of this island has
five syllables.

1930
01:06:04,360 --> 01:06:06,200
(It's far from the answer.)

1931
01:06:06,200 --> 01:06:07,550
- It's an island.
- Okay.

1932
01:06:07,650 --> 01:06:10,030
- It's where lonely people gather.
- Okay.

1933
01:06:10,090 --> 01:06:12,260
It's where lonely people
communicate.

1934
01:06:13,470 --> 01:06:15,240
(It's infuriating.)

1935
01:06:15,240 --> 01:06:16,700
- It has five syllables.
- Goodness.

1936
01:06:16,700 --> 01:06:17,700
Five syllables?

1937
01:06:17,700 --> 01:06:19,240
- It's five syllables.
- It's a syndrome.

1938
01:06:19,240 --> 01:06:20,880
- Is it five syllables?
- Yes.

1939
01:06:20,880 --> 01:06:22,110
It's an island for lonely people?

1940
01:06:22,200 --> 01:06:23,970
Lonely island syndrome.

1941
01:06:23,970 --> 01:06:26,820
(Lonely island syndrome is wrong.)

1942
01:06:26,950 --> 01:06:28,740
(We're doomed in this round.)

1943
01:06:28,880 --> 01:06:30,050
This is too hard.

1944
01:06:30,610 --> 01:06:31,720
I told you it's difficult.

1945
01:06:32,220 --> 01:06:33,860
- Next team.
- What comes after "super"?

1946
01:06:34,110 --> 01:06:36,720
What's a word for a new person?

1947
01:06:36,720 --> 01:06:38,130
- Super...
- Super rookie?

1948
01:06:38,130 --> 01:06:39,700
- Right. It's three syllables.
- Rookie?

1949
01:06:39,700 --> 01:06:40,760
Rookie-ism?

1950
01:06:41,490 --> 01:06:43,590
(They're off to a good start.)

1951
01:06:43,860 --> 01:06:46,170
What comes after super?
It means a new person.

1952
01:06:46,300 --> 01:06:47,430
- Man.
- No.

1953
01:06:47,760 --> 01:06:49,970
(It's obviously Superman.)

1954
01:06:50,570 --> 01:06:51,840
You ran out of time.

1955
01:06:52,570 --> 01:06:53,900
Yawn? Four syllables?

1956
01:06:54,530 --> 01:06:55,530
Thunder.

1957
01:06:55,530 --> 01:06:56,950
You can talk.

1958
01:06:58,300 --> 01:07:00,840
(He's acting silly
when he's allowed to talk.)

1959
01:07:00,920 --> 01:07:02,650
- How many syllables, you jerk?
- How many syllables?

1960
01:07:02,650 --> 01:07:03,920
Not the front but...

1961
01:07:03,920 --> 01:07:05,180
- The back.
- Okay.

1962
01:07:05,180 --> 01:07:06,180
It's a total of six syllables.

1963
01:07:06,180 --> 01:07:08,260
Not the front but...

1964
01:07:08,260 --> 01:07:10,220
- Not the front but...
- The back.

1965
01:07:10,360 --> 01:07:11,590
Isn't it Children's Back Syndrome?

1966
01:07:12,590 --> 01:07:13,700
Is it right?

1967
01:07:13,700 --> 01:07:14,820
(Children's Back Syndrome
is correct.)

1968
01:07:14,820 --> 01:07:16,360
(They get
the last question correct.)

1969
01:07:16,360 --> 01:07:17,530
- Okay.
- We got it.

1970
01:07:17,530 --> 01:07:19,400
I was worried because
you said "back".

1971
01:07:20,300 --> 01:07:22,430
As a result, Team Jong Kook won.

1972
01:07:22,800 --> 01:07:24,430
- Among the team members,
- We won.

1973
01:07:24,430 --> 01:07:26,800
- we'll pick the winner.
- We won.

1974
01:07:27,070 --> 01:07:28,340
- We won but...
- Even though we won,

1975
01:07:28,340 --> 01:07:29,970
- we have to keep playing.
- Will we choose a winner?

1976
01:07:29,970 --> 01:07:32,550
It's so funny that we won.

1977
01:07:32,820 --> 01:07:34,420
We're starving.

1978
01:07:34,420 --> 01:07:35,510
It's driving me nuts.

1979
01:07:35,510 --> 01:07:37,680
- Can we play rock-paper-scissors?
- It doesn't matter.

1980
01:07:37,740 --> 01:07:38,920
Who will be the winner?

1981
01:07:38,920 --> 01:07:41,180
I didn't win
rock-paper-scissors at all today.

1982
01:07:41,180 --> 01:07:43,130
- Rock-paper-scissors.
- Rock-paper-scissors.

1983
01:07:44,050 --> 01:07:46,320
(Jong Kook and So Min win.)

1984
01:07:46,320 --> 01:07:47,630
Please.

1985
01:07:47,900 --> 01:07:49,630
- Please.
- Jong Kook will win again.

1986
01:07:50,260 --> 01:07:51,570
- So Min will lose.
- Please.

1987
01:07:51,570 --> 01:07:53,490
I always lose in the second round.

1988
01:07:53,630 --> 01:07:55,360
- So Min will definitely lose.
- Rock-paper-scissors.

1989
01:07:56,200 --> 01:07:58,510
(So Min wins a chance to eat.)

1990
01:07:58,510 --> 01:08:00,180
I was going to play scissors.

1991
01:08:01,240 --> 01:08:03,200
(He's disappointed.)

1992
01:08:04,240 --> 01:08:05,400
(So Min wins a chance to eat.)

1993
01:08:05,400 --> 01:08:06,880
So Min...

1994
01:08:07,220 --> 01:08:09,740
may either pick a card
or clear a special mission.

1995
01:08:09,740 --> 01:08:11,780
- So Min, clear a special mission.
- I'll take a special mission.

1996
01:08:11,780 --> 01:08:12,820
Okay.

1997
01:08:13,420 --> 01:08:14,490
Special mission, So Min.

1998
01:08:14,490 --> 01:08:15,880
- You can do it.
- It's a mission.

1999
01:08:16,720 --> 01:08:18,220
- I'll take a special mission.
- So Min.

2000
01:08:18,220 --> 01:08:20,130
Go outside for your special mission.

2001
01:08:20,130 --> 01:08:21,130
Here I go.

2002
01:08:21,130 --> 01:08:24,320
(What kind of
special mission awaits her?)

2003
01:08:24,320 --> 01:08:25,320
What is it?

2004
01:08:25,320 --> 01:08:27,890
(She goes outside
for her special mission.)

2005
01:08:27,890 --> 01:08:30,010
"Take a bottle of water
from the stand in front of you."

2006
01:08:30,010 --> 01:08:35,530
"You win if you reach the mark
without the attendant noticing."

2007
01:08:35,530 --> 01:08:38,850
Take a bottle of water
and reach within this red line.

2008
01:08:38,850 --> 01:08:41,220
If the attendant touches
or catches you, you fail.

2009
01:08:42,550 --> 01:08:43,890
How can I take it
without her noticing?

2010
01:08:44,140 --> 01:08:45,720
(So Min and the stand)

2011
01:08:45,720 --> 01:08:47,850
(The stand is far away.)

2012
01:08:47,850 --> 01:08:49,590
How am I going to take it
without her noticing?

2013
01:08:49,590 --> 01:08:51,450
(She fails if she gets caught
before the finish line.)

2014
01:08:51,450 --> 01:08:53,260
I should have picked a card.

2015
01:08:54,760 --> 01:08:58,130
(She must run this distance
without getting caught.)

2016
01:08:58,130 --> 01:09:00,470
- Hello.
- Hello.

2017
01:09:01,100 --> 01:09:02,940
I picked this mushroom
on my way here,

2018
01:09:02,940 --> 01:09:04,140
but what this place?

2019
01:09:04,140 --> 01:09:05,360
This is a store.

2020
01:09:05,360 --> 01:09:07,880
(She checks where the water is.)

2021
01:09:08,440 --> 01:09:09,940
Can I buy something?

2022
01:09:09,940 --> 01:09:11,200
Yes, you can buy anything.

2023
01:09:11,200 --> 01:09:12,510
What would you like?

2024
01:09:12,880 --> 01:09:15,850
- Can you give me some water?
- Okay.

2025
01:09:16,980 --> 01:09:20,090
(The attendant hands her the water
without being suspicious.)

2026
01:09:20,260 --> 01:09:23,060
- Water and...
- Okay.

2027
01:09:23,060 --> 01:09:24,060
(She obtains a bottle of water.)

2028
01:09:25,020 --> 01:09:26,150
soda.

2029
01:09:26,150 --> 01:09:28,320
May I get the one on the left?

2030
01:09:29,860 --> 01:09:32,470
(She sees her opportunity.)

2031
01:09:32,940 --> 01:09:34,690
(When the worker turns around,)

2032
01:09:34,690 --> 01:09:35,990
Corn chips or something like that.

2033
01:09:35,990 --> 01:09:37,560
(She runs away.)

2034
01:09:37,730 --> 01:09:39,140
Corn chips or something like that.

2035
01:09:39,140 --> 01:09:42,440
(She just needs
to reach the finish line.)

2036
01:09:44,070 --> 01:09:46,610
(She sees So Min running away.)

2037
01:09:47,770 --> 01:09:50,190
(Catch that thief.)

2038
01:09:51,920 --> 01:09:55,810
(The attendant chases after So Min
at a frightening speed.)

2039
01:09:57,730 --> 01:10:00,950
(She gets closer to So Min.)

2040
01:10:03,820 --> 01:10:04,890
Goodness.

2041
01:10:04,890 --> 01:10:06,970
(She throws away the water bottle.)

2042
01:10:07,730 --> 01:10:09,030
(So Min doesn't get far,)

2043
01:10:09,030 --> 01:10:10,600
(and gets touched.)

2044
01:10:10,600 --> 01:10:11,640
She's so fast.

2045
01:10:12,810 --> 01:10:14,730
(So Min's special mission...)

2046
01:10:14,730 --> 01:10:17,510
(is a fail.)

2047
01:10:17,880 --> 01:10:20,050
I want to eat too.

2048
01:10:21,570 --> 01:10:23,350
I usually run 100m in 21 seconds.

2049
01:10:25,240 --> 01:10:27,760
I don't think I ever ran
this fast in my life.

2050
01:10:27,760 --> 01:10:29,930
(However, she wasn't fast enough
to clear the mission.)

2051
01:10:29,980 --> 01:10:31,760
She's very fast.

2052
01:10:32,560 --> 01:10:34,950
(She touched So Min very quickly.)

2053
01:10:34,950 --> 01:10:38,360
(Who is this worker?)

2054
01:10:39,390 --> 01:10:41,530
(Athlete Choi Soo In)

2055
01:10:41,530 --> 01:10:44,030
(Gold medalist of an international
track and field competition)

2056
01:10:44,360 --> 01:10:47,700
(She's a rising star
in middle-distance running.)

2057
01:10:47,700 --> 01:10:49,940
("Choi Soo In,
A Double Gold Medalist")

2058
01:10:49,940 --> 01:10:51,100
("The Future of
Korea's Track and Field")

2059
01:10:51,980 --> 01:10:54,050
(To clear the mission, one must
defeat Athlete Choi Soo In.)

2060
01:10:54,270 --> 01:10:55,940
(It's an extreme mission.)

2061
01:10:55,940 --> 01:10:58,610
(Will anyone clear
this special mission?)

2062
01:10:59,090 --> 01:11:01,260
- So Min is back.
- So Min is here.

2063
01:11:01,260 --> 01:11:02,560
- Where?
- Did you succeed?

2064
01:11:03,090 --> 01:11:04,890
Of course not.

2065
01:11:05,320 --> 01:11:06,930
I shouldn't have been greedy.

2066
01:11:06,930 --> 01:11:08,230
- Did you fail?
- She failed.

2067
01:11:09,100 --> 01:11:10,170
Why are you panting?

2068
01:11:10,170 --> 01:11:11,670
There's a reason.

2069
01:11:11,670 --> 01:11:12,820
(If you're curious, go outside.)

2070
01:11:12,820 --> 01:11:14,030
I'm exhausted.

2071
01:11:14,030 --> 01:11:16,030
(What kind of mission is it?)

2072
01:11:16,030 --> 01:11:17,270
I'm so tired.

2073
01:11:17,270 --> 01:11:18,530
Is everyone hungry?

2074
01:11:18,530 --> 01:11:19,680
- Yes.
- Yes.

2075
01:11:19,730 --> 01:11:21,030
Here's your last mission.

2076
01:11:21,030 --> 01:11:23,640
It's called Spinning King of Chairs.

2077
01:11:23,640 --> 01:11:25,070
- I can't do it.
- It'll be dizzy.

2078
01:11:25,070 --> 01:11:26,270
I can't do things
that make me dizzy.

2079
01:11:26,270 --> 01:11:28,420
- It's a team competition.
- Team?

2080
01:11:28,420 --> 01:11:29,720
It'll be 4 on 4.

2081
01:11:29,720 --> 01:11:31,190
One person
from each team will play...

2082
01:11:31,190 --> 01:11:33,780
with their eyes covered.
When the spinning chair stops,

2083
01:11:33,920 --> 01:11:37,480
you succeed if you hit
the opponent with a squeaker hammer.

2084
01:11:37,480 --> 01:11:39,190
- What?
- It sounds difficult.

2085
01:11:39,430 --> 01:11:41,100
The team members will be important.

2086
01:11:41,230 --> 01:11:42,730
We need to get on a good team.

2087
01:11:43,430 --> 01:11:44,490
All right.

2088
01:11:45,100 --> 01:11:46,530
- So Min.
- Mine is...

2089
01:11:46,800 --> 01:11:48,530
- Blue.
- Red.

2090
01:11:48,530 --> 01:11:50,030
(Teams are determined.)

2091
01:11:50,030 --> 01:11:51,530
The teams are decided.

2092
01:11:51,530 --> 01:11:53,530
One from each team will come out.

2093
01:11:53,880 --> 01:11:54,940
Let's start.

2094
01:11:54,940 --> 01:11:55,980
(Suk Jin is on defense,
and Kwang Soo is on offense.)

2095
01:11:56,940 --> 01:11:59,070
- Can you do it, Kwang Soo?
- Yes.

2096
01:11:59,940 --> 01:12:01,140
- What?
- Wait.

2097
01:12:01,140 --> 01:12:02,240
- You get dizzy.
- Which direction is it?

2098
01:12:02,240 --> 01:12:03,240
That's right.

2099
01:12:03,240 --> 01:12:04,890
- He senses the direction.
- Okay.

2100
01:12:04,890 --> 01:12:06,020
That's good.

2101
01:12:06,020 --> 01:12:07,890
- Shall we start from here?
- Spin him.

2102
01:12:07,890 --> 01:12:09,690
- Let's start from here.
- That sounds good.

2103
01:12:09,690 --> 01:12:10,950
How about here?

2104
01:12:11,930 --> 01:12:14,560
- Kwang Soo.
- This is great.

2105
01:12:14,850 --> 01:12:16,470
- Okay.
- Spin his chair.

2106
01:12:16,470 --> 01:12:17,990
- Are you having fun?
- Wait.

2107
01:12:18,300 --> 01:12:19,360
You have to spin it.

2108
01:12:19,360 --> 01:12:20,470
- Here we go.
- Spin it now.

2109
01:12:20,470 --> 01:12:21,560
Start.

2110
01:12:21,560 --> 01:12:23,170
(They spin his chair.)

2111
01:12:23,170 --> 01:12:24,170
He got it.

2112
01:12:24,640 --> 01:12:27,510
(His sense of direction is ruined
because he was interrupted.)

2113
01:12:28,810 --> 01:12:30,350
(He's pointing
in the opposite direction.)

2114
01:12:32,810 --> 01:12:34,810
(I think this is where Suk Jin is.)

2115
01:12:34,810 --> 01:12:36,350
(It's completely wrong.)

2116
01:12:37,050 --> 01:12:39,140
(He has lost his sense
of direction.)

2117
01:12:40,220 --> 01:12:42,150
(They distract him
so that he feels movement.)

2118
01:12:42,150 --> 01:12:45,190
If I concentrate,
I'll hear something.

2119
01:12:46,090 --> 01:12:47,390
(Snapping)

2120
01:12:48,560 --> 01:12:50,230
(Jae Suk does something
confuse him.)

2121
01:12:50,690 --> 01:12:51,970
(Don't be fooled, Kwang Soo.)

2122
01:12:51,970 --> 01:12:53,560
If the sound is coming
from over here,

2123
01:12:53,560 --> 01:12:55,140
that means the cameras
aren't on this side.

2124
01:12:55,140 --> 01:12:56,810
(He uses all five senses.)

2125
01:12:56,810 --> 01:12:58,860
There's no way that
he turned his back on the cameras.

2126
01:12:58,860 --> 01:12:59,940
Cameras are on this side.

2127
01:12:59,940 --> 01:13:01,570
(He's exactly right.)

2128
01:13:02,530 --> 01:13:04,240
(Kwang Soo figured out
the direction.)

2129
01:13:04,240 --> 01:13:07,810
(All he has to do is
hit him with the squeaky hammer.)

2130
01:13:07,810 --> 01:13:09,270
(Stop it, Jae Suk.)

2131
01:13:10,050 --> 01:13:11,980
(It's okay. Trust me.)

2132
01:13:13,260 --> 01:13:17,090
(Will Kwang Soo hit Suk Jin?)

2133
01:13:17,480 --> 01:13:18,630
What?

2134
01:13:18,630 --> 01:13:19,730
(Swinging)

2135
01:13:19,730 --> 01:13:20,730
(His ridiculous swing misses.)

2136
01:13:20,730 --> 01:13:22,760
Didn't you say that
the cameras are on this side?

2137
01:13:22,760 --> 01:13:25,470
- Fool, you said cameras were here.
- You were right. What's wrong?

2138
01:13:25,470 --> 01:13:26,670
I don't understand.

2139
01:13:26,670 --> 01:13:28,470
- I don't understand it at all.
- It's hard to know.

2140
01:13:28,470 --> 01:13:29,560
All right.

2141
01:13:30,770 --> 01:13:32,560
You said that the cameras are on
this side, but you swung this way.

2142
01:13:32,560 --> 01:13:34,140
- They were on this side.
- This is...

2143
01:13:34,140 --> 01:13:35,680
- a fool's game.
- He said cameras were here.

2144
01:13:35,680 --> 01:13:37,600
So I thought he'd swing that way.

2145
01:13:37,600 --> 01:13:39,100
I thought he'd hit me too.

2146
01:13:39,100 --> 01:13:40,110
- Who's next?
- Okay.

2147
01:13:40,110 --> 01:13:41,920
- We'll give you tips.
- Okay.

2148
01:13:43,350 --> 01:13:45,590
(Jong Kook spins Ji Hyo's chair.)

2149
01:13:47,020 --> 01:13:48,980
(It's a powerful spin.)

2150
01:13:49,650 --> 01:13:51,230
(Nice one, Jong Kook.)

2151
01:13:51,950 --> 01:13:53,930
I spun so many times.

2152
01:13:54,560 --> 01:13:57,270
(Ji Hyo became the spinning top
from "Inception".)

2153
01:13:57,390 --> 01:13:59,320
Wait, I'm nauseous.

2154
01:13:59,970 --> 01:14:01,170
(Nice, Jong Kook.)

2155
01:14:02,030 --> 01:14:04,230
(The chair finally stops
after 20 turns.)

2156
01:14:04,230 --> 01:14:05,340
Wait.

2157
01:14:05,340 --> 01:14:08,180
(She must have lost
her sense of direction.)

2158
01:14:08,180 --> 01:14:09,700
(I hope that she finds
her sense of direction.)

2159
01:14:10,380 --> 01:14:12,010
(She uses all her five senses.)

2160
01:14:12,010 --> 01:14:13,380
I can't hear anything.

2161
01:14:14,680 --> 01:14:16,240
(Pulling)

2162
01:14:17,020 --> 01:14:18,550
(Suk Jin cheats.)

2163
01:14:19,240 --> 01:14:20,920
(You can't cheat.)

2164
01:14:22,480 --> 01:14:24,150
I feel like someone is here.

2165
01:14:24,820 --> 01:14:26,280
(His body freezes except his eyes.)

2166
01:14:26,850 --> 01:14:28,300
I think someone is here.

2167
01:14:28,950 --> 01:14:30,430
If someone is here...

2168
01:14:30,430 --> 01:14:31,970
(He moves only his lips.)

2169
01:14:32,270 --> 01:14:33,440
Right?

2170
01:14:33,440 --> 01:14:35,060
(Moving slowly)

2171
01:14:35,490 --> 01:14:37,030
(Yes, that's exactly right.)

2172
01:14:37,030 --> 01:14:38,360
Kwang Soo must be...

2173
01:14:38,360 --> 01:14:39,360
(No...)

2174
01:14:39,670 --> 01:14:40,880
Kwang Soo must be...

2175
01:14:41,480 --> 01:14:42,530
here.

2176
01:14:42,530 --> 01:14:43,600
What?

2177
01:14:44,640 --> 01:14:45,880
He got hit.

2178
01:14:45,880 --> 01:14:47,980
(She hit Kwang Soo.)

2179
01:14:47,980 --> 01:14:49,440
- He got hit.
- He got hit.

2180
01:14:49,440 --> 01:14:50,550
He got hit.

2181
01:14:50,550 --> 01:14:51,640
He got hit on his shoulder.

2182
01:14:51,640 --> 01:14:52,780
Ji Hyo.

2183
01:14:52,780 --> 01:14:55,090
(How did she hit him?)

2184
01:14:55,090 --> 01:14:56,110
That's impressive.

2185
01:14:56,150 --> 01:14:57,230
Okay.

2186
01:14:57,230 --> 01:14:58,890
- As a result,
- We won.

2187
01:14:58,890 --> 01:15:00,690
Jae Suk, Haha, Suk Jin,
and Ji Hyo wins.

2188
01:15:00,690 --> 01:15:02,890
(Thanks to Ji Hyo, they win.)

2189
01:15:02,890 --> 01:15:05,730
We have to pick the winner
from the four of you.

2190
01:15:05,730 --> 01:15:07,690
The one who picks the dud will be
the winner.

2191
01:15:07,690 --> 01:15:08,730
- The dud?
- Is that the winner?

2192
01:15:08,730 --> 01:15:11,030
- The one with the dud wins.
- Dud means you won.

2193
01:15:11,270 --> 01:15:13,270
1, 2, 3.

2194
01:15:13,270 --> 01:15:14,810
(Who will pick the dud and win?)

2195
01:15:14,810 --> 01:15:16,400
1, 2, 3.

2196
01:15:16,400 --> 01:15:17,480
Dud!

2197
01:15:18,200 --> 01:15:19,510
- 1, 2, 3.
- Dud!

2198
01:15:20,480 --> 01:15:23,070
(Haha picks the dud.)

2199
01:15:23,810 --> 01:15:24,810
Dud!

2200
01:15:24,810 --> 01:15:26,560
(Haha gets to choose
a special mission or pick a card.)

2201
01:15:26,560 --> 01:15:28,760
Haha, will you pick a card...

2202
01:15:28,760 --> 01:15:30,520
or do a special mission?

2203
01:15:30,520 --> 01:15:32,190
- Pick the mission.
- You should pick the mission.

2204
01:15:32,190 --> 01:15:33,650
You should do it.

2205
01:15:33,650 --> 01:15:34,730
I choose the special mission.

2206
01:15:34,800 --> 01:15:37,270
If you clear the mission, you
and a person of your choice may...

2207
01:15:37,270 --> 01:15:38,820
- eat for 3 minutes.
- 3 minutes?

2208
01:15:38,820 --> 01:15:40,990
- That's amazing.
- That's amazing, Haha.

2209
01:15:40,990 --> 01:15:42,230
- Good luck.
- Is it for three minutes?

2210
01:15:42,230 --> 01:15:43,310
Three minutes is a lot.

2211
01:15:43,310 --> 01:15:44,310
- That's great.
- I'm starving.

2212
01:15:44,310 --> 01:15:45,310
Do it.

2213
01:15:45,310 --> 01:15:46,810
Haha, please go
outside the building.

2214
01:15:46,810 --> 01:15:48,010
- Me?
- Thank you.

2215
01:15:48,010 --> 01:15:49,980
- Haha, I love you.
- Okay.

2216
01:15:49,980 --> 01:15:51,570
Don't forget that
you sprayed water on me.

2217
01:15:51,700 --> 01:15:52,810
Okay.

2218
01:15:53,640 --> 01:15:54,880
What's the special mission?

2219
01:15:55,720 --> 01:15:57,090
(What's the special mission?)

2220
01:15:57,090 --> 01:15:58,190
"Go to the stand in front of you."

2221
01:15:58,190 --> 01:16:00,560
"Take a bottle of water.
You win if you reach the mark."

2222
01:16:01,450 --> 01:16:02,590
I have to steal it right?

2223
01:16:02,890 --> 01:16:04,090
Okay.

2224
01:16:04,730 --> 01:16:06,600
Who's the attendant?

2225
01:16:06,950 --> 01:16:08,190
Here I go.

2226
01:16:08,800 --> 01:16:10,190
How should I do it?

2227
01:16:10,190 --> 01:16:11,300
(He heads to the store.)

2228
01:16:11,300 --> 01:16:13,020
- Hello.
- Hello.

2229
01:16:13,690 --> 01:16:15,770
(Getting a water bottle
is the priority.)

2230
01:16:15,770 --> 01:16:17,200
What do you sell?

2231
01:16:17,470 --> 01:16:19,900
- I sell almost everything.
- "Almost everything"?

2232
01:16:20,180 --> 01:16:21,640
First of all,

2233
01:16:22,270 --> 01:16:24,510
give me everything from
the first and second shelves.

2234
01:16:24,510 --> 01:16:25,770
- Everything?
- Yes.

2235
01:16:25,770 --> 01:16:26,920
(Athlete Choi Soo In)

2236
01:16:26,920 --> 01:16:29,240
(Her identity is revealed.)

2237
01:16:29,240 --> 01:16:31,190
(Shocked)

2238
01:16:31,590 --> 01:16:33,090
(Does he have to run...)

2239
01:16:33,090 --> 01:16:36,520
(across this wide field
faster than a gold medalist?)

2240
01:16:36,520 --> 01:16:39,260
(How can I win this?)

2241
01:16:40,390 --> 01:16:42,490
How much is it per item?

2242
01:16:42,490 --> 01:16:44,670
A bag of chips is two dollars.

2243
01:16:44,670 --> 01:16:46,230
A drink is a dollar.

2244
01:16:47,140 --> 01:16:48,140
That one.

2245
01:16:48,470 --> 01:16:50,030
May I get that and...

2246
01:16:50,030 --> 01:16:52,400
(He runs.)

2247
01:16:53,340 --> 01:16:55,900
(As soon as she turns around,
Haha starts.)

2248
01:16:56,010 --> 01:16:58,570
(He increases the distance
successfully.)

2249
01:16:59,240 --> 01:17:01,070
(His opponent is a gold medalist.)

2250
01:17:02,050 --> 01:17:04,310
(She's right after Haha.)

2251
01:17:04,420 --> 01:17:05,480
Where is it?

2252
01:17:05,480 --> 01:17:07,590
(He sees the finish line.)

2253
01:17:07,760 --> 01:17:10,760
(Did Haha win
and clear the mission?)

2254
01:17:10,760 --> 01:17:12,350
- He's back.
- What's wrong with him?

2255
01:17:13,060 --> 01:17:14,800
- Did you finish the mission?
- I think so.

2256
01:17:14,800 --> 01:17:16,060
Is the mission easy enough?

2257
01:17:16,150 --> 01:17:18,130
- I think he failed.
- Did you clear it?

2258
01:17:18,270 --> 01:17:20,170
I think he cleared it.
I bet it was hard.

2259
01:17:20,170 --> 01:17:21,170
Haha's mission was...

2260
01:17:21,170 --> 01:17:23,340
(What's the result of
Haha's mission?)

2261
01:17:23,340 --> 01:17:25,400
(Athlete Choi Soo In gets closer
to him.)

2262
01:17:25,400 --> 01:17:26,440
Why is she so fast?

2263
01:17:28,380 --> 01:17:29,530
(With just one step ahead,)

2264
01:17:29,530 --> 01:17:32,010
(Haha gets to the finish line.)

2265
01:17:32,900 --> 01:17:35,550
(Choi Soo In couldn't catch Haha.)

2266
01:17:35,720 --> 01:17:37,420
Haha, you've cleared the mission.

2267
01:17:37,810 --> 01:17:39,390
Why is she so fast?

2268
01:17:39,920 --> 01:17:40,950
Did she win a gold medal?

2269
01:17:40,950 --> 01:17:41,950
(I almost caught him.)

2270
01:17:42,310 --> 01:17:43,630
Was she this close to me?

2271
01:17:43,630 --> 01:17:44,760
(He almost got caught.)

2272
01:17:46,820 --> 01:17:49,020
(Haha's plan was perfect.)

2273
01:17:50,190 --> 01:17:52,930
(He started as soon as
her weight moved behind.)

2274
01:17:53,640 --> 01:17:55,860
(The start is important
for short-distance runs.)

2275
01:17:55,860 --> 01:17:56,860
She's so fast.

2276
01:17:56,860 --> 01:18:00,010
(The finish line was close enough
to reduce the distance apart.)

2277
01:18:00,100 --> 01:18:01,880
- Haha's mission was a success.
- That's right!

2278
01:18:02,200 --> 01:18:03,680
- What was it?
- What was it?

2279
01:18:03,680 --> 01:18:04,700
What did you do?

2280
01:18:04,850 --> 01:18:06,310
He cleared the special mission.

2281
01:18:06,310 --> 01:18:07,640
- With one more person,
- I bet it was hard.

2282
01:18:07,640 --> 01:18:09,550
he may eat for three minutes.

2283
01:18:09,550 --> 01:18:10,890
Three minutes? That's amazing.

2284
01:18:10,890 --> 01:18:12,590
- Haha.
- If it was long distance...

2285
01:18:12,590 --> 01:18:13,610
Haha.

2286
01:18:13,610 --> 01:18:15,780
Haha, please pick one person.

2287
01:18:15,780 --> 01:18:18,280
- Haha.
- I will never forget it.

2288
01:18:18,280 --> 01:18:19,560
- Haha.
- I'll eat only a little.

2289
01:18:19,560 --> 01:18:20,730
- Haha.
- Okay.

2290
01:18:20,730 --> 01:18:22,020
Ji Hyo.

2291
01:18:22,020 --> 01:18:23,320
Ji Hyo is impressive.

2292
01:18:23,690 --> 01:18:24,820
Thank you.

2293
01:18:24,990 --> 01:18:26,490
Haha.

2294
01:18:26,490 --> 01:18:28,140
He ate last time thanks to me.
He eats again.

2295
01:18:28,140 --> 01:18:29,230
You have three minutes.

2296
01:18:29,230 --> 01:18:31,940
The count will start now.

2297
01:18:33,270 --> 01:18:35,010
Try some dried yellow corvina.

2298
01:18:35,010 --> 01:18:36,480
There's a lot to eat.

2299
01:18:36,480 --> 01:18:38,100
(Ji Hyo starts to eat
dried yellow corvina first.)

2300
01:18:38,100 --> 01:18:40,570
Ji Hyo, you should eat
dried yellow corvina with rice.

2301
01:18:40,570 --> 01:18:41,940
- I couldn't wait.
- Try some.

2302
01:18:41,940 --> 01:18:44,420
(It's more delicious
with just us two.)

2303
01:18:44,720 --> 01:18:46,050
- It looks delicious.
- What is that?

2304
01:18:46,050 --> 01:18:48,920
They chose only delicious food.

2305
01:18:49,190 --> 01:18:50,890
It's so long.

2306
01:18:51,450 --> 01:18:53,260
Is it his second time eating?

2307
01:18:53,730 --> 01:18:56,390
He's such a selfish jerk.

2308
01:18:56,390 --> 01:18:57,670
(They're jealous.)

2309
01:18:58,060 --> 01:18:59,990
- We have to make him regret.
- Five,

2310
01:19:00,360 --> 01:19:02,230
4, 3,

2311
01:19:02,230 --> 01:19:03,810
2, 1.

2312
01:19:03,810 --> 01:19:05,310
- Time's up.
- Please come out.

2313
01:19:06,440 --> 01:19:08,770
(I still have room for dessert.)

2314
01:19:09,200 --> 01:19:10,350
Goodness.

2315
01:19:10,350 --> 01:19:11,400
(Their mealtime is over.)

2316
01:19:11,400 --> 01:19:14,740
As promised, three hours are up.

2317
01:19:14,740 --> 01:19:17,720
Except for Haha and Ji Hyo,

2318
01:19:17,720 --> 01:19:19,310
no one ate.

2319
01:19:19,310 --> 01:19:21,720
We have to pick one person
to be penalized.

2320
01:19:21,720 --> 01:19:22,720
- Is it 1 person?
- 1 person?

2321
01:19:22,720 --> 01:19:24,780
There are six of you.

2322
01:19:24,780 --> 01:19:26,060
I can't believe we couldn't eat.

2323
01:19:26,060 --> 01:19:27,950
Among six cards,

2324
01:19:27,950 --> 01:19:30,390
we put an X on one card.

2325
01:19:30,560 --> 01:19:32,430
I'm very unlucky
at picking cards today.

2326
01:19:32,630 --> 01:19:33,970
- Jong Kook is unlucky today.
- I'm serious.

2327
01:19:33,970 --> 01:19:37,440
- It's not my day.
- Let it be Jong Kook.

2328
01:19:37,440 --> 01:19:39,770
I'll shuffle the cards
and give them to you.

2329
01:19:39,840 --> 01:19:41,680
I'll tell you
what the penalty is first.

2330
01:19:41,700 --> 01:19:44,550
It's the one So Min did before.
When we're having guests,

2331
01:19:44,550 --> 01:19:46,880
you'll dress up as someone else
for the opening segment.

2332
01:19:46,880 --> 01:19:49,440
If So Min gets it,
we'll do that twice.

2333
01:19:49,440 --> 01:19:50,440
Here we go.

2334
01:19:50,440 --> 01:19:52,350
- Who will pick it first?
- You should pick for me.

2335
01:19:52,350 --> 01:19:54,260
Earlier, I chose number four...

2336
01:19:54,260 --> 01:19:55,310
All right. Let's pick one.

2337
01:19:55,310 --> 01:19:57,060
- I'm having the worst luck today.
- I don't know anymore.

2338
01:19:57,060 --> 01:19:58,630
- I'll take the leftover.
- I chose mine.

2339
01:19:58,630 --> 01:19:59,850
Yes, just take the leftover card.

2340
01:20:00,760 --> 01:20:02,260
I'm having the worst luck.
I should wait and see.

2341
01:20:02,260 --> 01:20:04,060
It's a hassle dressing up
in the opening segment.

2342
01:20:04,060 --> 01:20:05,770
- And it's burdening too.
- All right.

2343
01:20:05,770 --> 01:20:06,770
We'll go one at a time.

2344
01:20:06,840 --> 01:20:07,970
- Se Chan. I hope it's you.
- Se Chan will go first.

2345
01:20:07,970 --> 01:20:09,190
- Let it be you, so this is over.
- I hope it's him.

2346
01:20:09,190 --> 01:20:10,470
- The X mark.
- It's the X mark.

2347
01:20:10,840 --> 01:20:12,230
(Se Chan passes.)

2348
01:20:12,230 --> 01:20:13,230
Okay!

2349
01:20:14,100 --> 01:20:15,600
- 1 of these 2 should have it.
- I hope it's him.

2350
01:20:15,600 --> 01:20:17,100
- It has to be him.
- It's between you two.

2351
01:20:17,100 --> 01:20:19,350
- It's you!
- Let it be you.

2352
01:20:19,350 --> 01:20:20,720
(Please!)

2353
01:20:22,220 --> 01:20:24,640
(Jae Suk passes too.)

2354
01:20:25,440 --> 01:20:26,590
- Let it be you.
- Jae Suk is happy.

2355
01:20:26,590 --> 01:20:27,590
It's got to be you.

2356
01:20:27,590 --> 01:20:28,850
- How many do we have left? Please.
- Let it be you.

2357
01:20:28,850 --> 01:20:29,950
- There are four left.
- Please, let it be Suk Jin.

2358
01:20:29,950 --> 01:20:32,260
- Then it's a 25 percent chance.
- In 1, 2, 3.

2359
01:20:32,260 --> 01:20:33,950
(4 members remain.
The probability is 25 percent.)

2360
01:20:34,520 --> 01:20:37,130
(Suk Jin gets the penalty.)

2361
01:20:37,130 --> 01:20:38,360
(Come on.)

2362
01:20:39,270 --> 01:20:40,730
Oh, no.

2363
01:20:41,030 --> 01:20:42,670
We're good.

2364
01:20:43,190 --> 01:20:44,700
- My gosh.
- Goodness.

2365
01:20:44,700 --> 01:20:45,700
All right.

2366
01:20:46,600 --> 01:20:49,570
There were two cards left
at the end, and Suk Jin chose that.

2367
01:20:50,570 --> 01:20:52,850
(It's total luck of the draw.
There were two cards remaining.)

2368
01:20:53,640 --> 01:20:55,550
(Suk Jin chose the card first.)

2369
01:20:55,550 --> 01:20:58,350
(And Jong Kook took the last card.)

2370
01:20:59,020 --> 01:21:01,420
Suk Jin will carry out the penalty.

2371
01:21:01,420 --> 01:21:03,730
We're done with today's mission.

2372
01:21:03,730 --> 01:21:05,260
- Okay.
- Okay!

2373
01:21:05,260 --> 01:21:06,760
(With what disguise
will Suk Jin make us laugh?)

2374
01:21:08,630 --> 01:21:10,320
(Those who don't belong
to this world showed up.)

2375
01:21:10,320 --> 01:21:11,600
My goodness!

2376
01:21:11,600 --> 01:21:13,390
(Hades is spiteful after
being exiled into the underworld.)

2377
01:21:14,890 --> 01:21:17,140
(Hades came back to this world
to catch Zeus and Poseidon.)

2378
01:21:17,970 --> 01:21:21,230
(The traces of Hades
are seen all over the place.)

2379
01:21:21,570 --> 01:21:24,640
(And these 4 mysterious individuals
are joining too.)

2380
01:21:26,440 --> 01:21:28,680
(In order to send back Hades
who is pretending to be a human,)

2381
01:21:28,680 --> 01:21:31,550
(they must reveal his identity
with hints and eliminate Hades.)

2382
01:21:32,740 --> 01:21:34,980
(Who is Hades,
hiding among the members?)

2383
01:21:34,980 --> 01:21:36,260
(Run away now!)

2384
01:21:37,230 --> 01:21:40,060
(The War of the Deities:
Hades' Revenge)
