1
00:00:05,750 --> 00:00:08,920
(College 'S' in Yongsan, Seoul)

2
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:11,190
Hello.

3
00:00:11,260 --> 00:00:12,330
Hello.

4
00:00:12,830 --> 00:00:15,660
My gosh, it is so hot. It's really hot.

5
00:00:15,660 --> 00:00:17,970
What do you mean? It's supposed to hot in summer.

6
00:00:17,970 --> 00:00:19,770
(Jae Suk scolds him as soon as he walks in.)

7
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:22,240
(He starts the filming with scolding.)

8
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:24,770
Hey, I think I said that last summer.

9
00:00:24,770 --> 00:00:27,710
Why are you complaining? It's not like it's your first summer.

10
00:00:27,710 --> 00:00:30,380
You experienced summer more than 50 times. What's the fuss?

11
00:00:30,380 --> 00:00:31,810
(He's brutally honest.)

12
00:00:31,810 --> 00:00:32,910
What's the fuss?

13
00:00:32,910 --> 00:00:34,950
- So don't complain too much. - Right.

14
00:00:35,020 --> 00:00:36,790
It's not your first summer or anything.

15
00:00:36,790 --> 00:00:38,290
- Exactly. - My gosh.

16
00:00:38,290 --> 00:00:39,720
- Oh, my. - What is it?

17
00:00:39,720 --> 00:00:42,220
You'll get shot if you go on a safari wearing that. Be careful.

18
00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:44,730
You know nothing about fashion. Isn't my outfit pretty nice?

19
00:00:44,730 --> 00:00:46,360
- Yes, it's a nice outfit. - It's nice.

20
00:00:46,360 --> 00:00:48,360
What's that? "UFC"?

21
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:51,600
- It's not nice. What's up with UFC? - What's that?

22
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:53,870
(He's startled.)

23
00:00:53,870 --> 00:00:54,970
- It's UFO? - UFO?

24
00:00:54,970 --> 00:00:56,710
- It says "UFO" there. - UFO?

25
00:00:56,710 --> 00:00:57,910
It says UFO.

26
00:00:57,910 --> 00:00:59,540
Why is UFO written there?

27
00:00:59,540 --> 00:01:01,640
It was UFO? What a twist.

28
00:01:01,640 --> 00:01:03,280
I thought it said UFC.

29
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:05,910
He's a strong man, UFO.

30
00:01:05,910 --> 00:01:08,080
(It's much better than UFC.)

31
00:01:08,980 --> 00:01:09,990
(Stop it!)

32
00:01:09,990 --> 00:01:12,520
Stop it. That's enough.

33
00:01:12,620 --> 00:01:15,790
That's awesome. You can only see "UF".

34
00:01:15,790 --> 00:01:16,930
- You'd think it was UFC. - Right?

35
00:01:16,930 --> 00:01:17,990
- Everyone would've assumed that. - My gosh.

36
00:01:17,990 --> 00:01:19,890
He's a strong man, UFO.

37
00:01:19,890 --> 00:01:21,000
(If you're a strong man, wear this.)

38
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,700
Unidentified Flying Object.

39
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:25,500
Hey, So Min.

40
00:01:25,630 --> 00:01:26,870
Are your shoulders okay?

41
00:01:26,870 --> 00:01:28,000
(Bare shoulders on a hot day like today?)

42
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,540
(Only her shoulders are burning up.)

43
00:01:29,540 --> 00:01:31,240
- You'll burn your shoulders. - On a day like today,

44
00:01:31,240 --> 00:01:33,170
- Hey, you'll burn your shoulders. - you'll get a sunburn.

45
00:01:33,170 --> 00:01:35,380
- I must've done something wrong. - What?

46
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:37,380
I guess I must've done something wrong to my stylist.

47
00:01:37,380 --> 00:01:40,650
If So Min's stylist gave her that outfit on a day like this,

48
00:01:40,650 --> 00:01:42,750
it means that she must have been fed up with So Min.

49
00:01:42,750 --> 00:01:43,990
- That's right. - Exactly.

50
00:01:43,990 --> 00:01:44,990
Is that obvious?

51
00:01:44,990 --> 00:01:46,150
- What? - So with this outfit, it's obvious?

52
00:01:46,150 --> 00:01:48,520
Her shoulders will be burnt when she goes home.

53
00:01:48,520 --> 00:01:50,530
It's like she's saying, "You should suffer too."

54
00:01:50,790 --> 00:01:52,260
- Did you hear? - What?

55
00:01:52,260 --> 00:01:54,000
- For our fan-meet, we received... - 200,000.

56
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,930
Thank you so much!

57
00:01:55,930 --> 00:01:59,170
(The sign-up page for the fan-meet received 200,000 views.)

58
00:01:59,170 --> 00:02:00,340
200,000 views?

59
00:02:00,340 --> 00:02:01,740
- Hey. I set this up, - What?

60
00:02:01,740 --> 00:02:03,810
so I could say that 200,000 people were on our website.

61
00:02:03,810 --> 00:02:05,470
- I already knew that. - Why did you steal that from me?

62
00:02:05,470 --> 00:02:06,640
I already knew that.

63
00:02:06,740 --> 00:02:09,180
- Thank you so much. - Thank you.

64
00:02:09,180 --> 00:02:12,180
200,000 people were on our website, but no one around me knows.

65
00:02:12,180 --> 00:02:13,880
- Be quiet. Why are you saying that? - I mean...

66
00:02:13,880 --> 00:02:15,350
- It's because they are shy. - What's wrong with you?

67
00:02:15,350 --> 00:02:17,290
- Is that so? Is that why? - They are shy.

68
00:02:17,290 --> 00:02:19,420
- Not to make you uncomfortable. - Are you here to criticize us?

69
00:02:20,020 --> 00:02:22,790
It looked like your friends wouldn't watch TV.

70
00:02:22,790 --> 00:02:24,760
(Jong Kook's friends from "Mom's Diary")

71
00:02:24,760 --> 00:02:26,660
What did you say? Are you criticizing their looks?

72
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:28,460
What's wrong with my friends?

73
00:02:28,460 --> 00:02:30,430
- It's just something people say. - What?

74
00:02:30,430 --> 00:02:32,000
- Then who looks like he'd watch TV? - Suk Jin.

75
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
- Suk Jin, do it now. Hurry. - Tell me.

76
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,700
(Suk Jin, show him the shirt.)

77
00:02:35,700 --> 00:02:37,270
(Strong Man, UFO)

78
00:02:37,270 --> 00:02:39,570
Describe how someone who watches TV often would look.

79
00:02:39,570 --> 00:02:40,740
- Give me an example. - Jong Kook.

80
00:02:40,740 --> 00:02:42,740
- This is it. - You look strong right away.

81
00:02:42,740 --> 00:02:45,150
- I see. - If you yell at him on a hot day,

82
00:02:45,150 --> 00:02:47,280
- you'll cause him to faint. - That might happen.

83
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:49,150
Don't do that to him. Don't provoke him.

84
00:02:49,980 --> 00:02:51,450
Today,

85
00:02:51,750 --> 00:02:54,590
you'll win once you retrieve your emergency fund of 6,000 dollars.

86
00:02:54,590 --> 00:02:55,660
It's called the Missing Emergency Fund Race.

87
00:02:55,660 --> 00:02:56,990
A 6,000-dollar emergency fund?

88
00:02:58,260 --> 00:03:00,300
It's gone missing again? Why do things keep disappearing?

89
00:03:00,300 --> 00:03:02,160
- By the way, - Things keep disappearing.

90
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:04,600
there are about two people among us who would actually steal money.

91
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:07,140
All right. You are siblings of six.

92
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:09,300
Each sibling had 1,000 dollars as their emergency fund...

93
00:03:09,300 --> 00:03:11,770
which means the entire emergency fund is 6,000 dollars in total.

94
00:03:11,770 --> 00:03:13,780
Two of us aren't real siblings.

95
00:03:14,580 --> 00:03:15,710
Your father whom you've parted with a long time ago...

96
00:03:15,710 --> 00:03:17,410
only left a letter...

97
00:03:17,410 --> 00:03:20,820
and withdrew the 6,000 dollars behind your backs.

98
00:03:20,820 --> 00:03:22,150
- Our father did? - First,

99
00:03:22,150 --> 00:03:24,090
- I'll show you the letter. - My goodness.

100
00:03:24,350 --> 00:03:25,550
He's not our father.

101
00:03:25,550 --> 00:03:27,160
(After taking the money, he left a letter.)

102
00:03:27,160 --> 00:03:28,160
He's not our real dad.

103
00:03:28,490 --> 00:03:30,160
Besides, our father...

104
00:03:30,330 --> 00:03:32,730
wrote the letter on the new year greeting card.

105
00:03:32,730 --> 00:03:34,130
Gosh, I haven't seen that for a while.

106
00:03:35,300 --> 00:03:36,600
"Read this, you brats."

107
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:38,670
- It's just "kids". - Read it how's it written.

108
00:03:38,670 --> 00:03:40,070
"Read this, you brats."

109
00:03:40,070 --> 00:03:42,170
- It's just "kids". - Read it how's it written.

110
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:43,910
- I read it wrong? - Yes, you read it wrong.

111
00:03:43,910 --> 00:03:45,340
- Yes. - I'm sorry.

112
00:03:45,640 --> 00:03:46,780
"Read this, kids."

113
00:03:46,910 --> 00:03:49,010
"My friend will be doing big business overseas."

114
00:03:49,010 --> 00:03:50,880
"So I sold our land and the house..."

115
00:03:51,010 --> 00:03:54,180
"and am taking the entire 6,000 dollars savings from home."

116
00:03:54,320 --> 00:03:56,380
"Since you're young, make money diligently from now on."

117
00:03:56,380 --> 00:03:58,450
"Please wish me luck with my new business."

118
00:03:59,690 --> 00:04:01,020
He sounds like an uncaring dad.

119
00:04:01,090 --> 00:04:03,590
One of you can have the letter on behalf of everyone.

120
00:04:04,060 --> 00:04:06,190
(Ms. Shoulders will be holding onto it.)

121
00:04:06,190 --> 00:04:07,330
Why are you taking it?

122
00:04:07,460 --> 00:04:09,130
I keep looking at So Min's shoulders.

123
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:11,070
- Your shoulders will be red. - She...

124
00:04:11,070 --> 00:04:12,330
(Call me Queen Shoulders.)

125
00:04:12,330 --> 00:04:13,970
- So Min... - What about the other two?

126
00:04:13,970 --> 00:04:16,810
Among the 8 of you, there are 6 siblings.

127
00:04:17,070 --> 00:04:18,670
And one of you is the father.

128
00:04:18,670 --> 00:04:22,310
(Among them, one of them is the father.)

129
00:04:22,310 --> 00:04:23,810
- I see. - He's among us?

130
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:25,050
He's here?

131
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:26,310
Can a woman be a father?

132
00:04:26,550 --> 00:04:27,720
Yes.

133
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:30,250
A stranger is hiding among you...

134
00:04:30,250 --> 00:04:33,620
in order to steal the money your father withdrew.

135
00:04:33,620 --> 00:04:34,760
- Stranger? - Stranger?

136
00:04:35,490 --> 00:04:36,930
- Why me? Why? - Lee Kwang Soo.

137
00:04:37,330 --> 00:04:39,060
(There you go again.)

138
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:41,130
- The stranger... - Stranger Kwang Soo.

139
00:04:41,130 --> 00:04:42,430
It doesn't sound like my name.

140
00:04:42,500 --> 00:04:44,530
- That's not my name. - It's Kwang Soo.

141
00:04:44,630 --> 00:04:46,630
- It all makes sense. - Stranger Kwang Soo.

142
00:04:47,170 --> 00:04:48,770
Currently, the father has lost his memory.

143
00:04:48,770 --> 00:04:50,870
The only memory he has is that he's a father.

144
00:04:50,870 --> 00:04:52,170
(Our father lost his memory?)

145
00:04:52,170 --> 00:04:54,380
The only memory he has is that he's a father.

146
00:04:54,380 --> 00:04:55,740
- He lost his memory? - This is...

147
00:04:55,740 --> 00:04:56,980
He lost his memory? Hold on.

148
00:04:57,250 --> 00:04:58,850
- His memory... - Wasn't that a big clue?

149
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:01,650
- If he lost his memory... - You all know who that is, right?

150
00:05:01,750 --> 00:05:03,990
Our father lost his memory as soon as he wrote the letter?

151
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:05,150
He's the father.

152
00:05:05,150 --> 00:05:06,490
Kwang Soo is the stranger.

153
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:08,860
All right. We caught them. The end.

154
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:11,130
- We can go home. - That wasn't it?

155
00:05:11,330 --> 00:05:14,700
The race will end when your father figures out his identity.

156
00:05:15,030 --> 00:05:18,000
He will be able to take all of the 6,000 dollars he withdrew.

157
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:19,530
I see. When the father finds out?

158
00:05:19,530 --> 00:05:21,200
No, he knows that he's the father.

159
00:05:21,270 --> 00:05:23,440
- He must figure out his identity. - His identity.

160
00:05:23,510 --> 00:05:27,240
If the siblings figure out who he is and eliminate him, they will win.

161
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:30,610
And the siblings will split the 6,000 dollars among themselves.

162
00:05:31,010 --> 00:05:32,150
That means we each get 1,000 dollars.

163
00:05:32,150 --> 00:05:33,820
- What about the stranger? - What about the stranger?

164
00:05:33,820 --> 00:05:36,380
Whenever the stranger eliminates a sibling,

165
00:05:36,380 --> 00:05:37,450
he or she gets 1,000 dollars.

166
00:05:38,020 --> 00:05:39,490
Once the stranger eliminates the father,

167
00:05:39,490 --> 00:05:41,560
the stranger can take the money he or she won.

168
00:05:41,790 --> 00:05:43,890
For example, if the stranger eliminates three siblings...

169
00:05:43,890 --> 00:05:45,460
and the father next, the stranger gets 3,000 dollars.

170
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:48,500
However, if one of the siblings eliminates the stranger...

171
00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:50,770
who is hiding among you,

172
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,500
the sibling who eliminated the stranger will get...

173
00:05:53,500 --> 00:05:55,770
the entire 6,000 dollars once he or she eliminates the father.

174
00:05:55,770 --> 00:05:57,570
- I should catch the stranger first. - That's right.

175
00:05:57,870 --> 00:06:00,380
The siblings, father, and a stranger are against one another.

176
00:06:00,380 --> 00:06:02,340
It's an individual match for everyone.

177
00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:05,710
Since your father withdrew all of the money,

178
00:06:05,710 --> 00:06:07,620
you cannot use your own money.

179
00:06:07,950 --> 00:06:11,320
You can borrow money from us to pay for the expenses of the missions.

180
00:06:11,690 --> 00:06:14,890
You must pay it back at the end by winning the cash prize.

181
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:16,860
The members who failed to win the cash prize...

182
00:06:16,860 --> 00:06:19,330
must pay back the money in another way.

183
00:06:19,530 --> 00:06:22,100
I'll explain how to pay back the money.

184
00:06:22,100 --> 00:06:23,700
- We have to take out loans. - Okay.

185
00:06:23,770 --> 00:06:25,870
It's the penalty. Will we pay it back with penalties?

186
00:06:25,870 --> 00:06:27,400
- He's right. That's it. - I was right.

187
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:29,340
- I'm doomed. - We must do the penalties.

188
00:06:29,340 --> 00:06:30,540
(Under 100 dollars, spanking)

189
00:06:30,670 --> 00:06:32,210
I've had this before. You'll die.

190
00:06:32,210 --> 00:06:33,910
("Wireless" bungee jumping)

191
00:06:33,910 --> 00:06:35,780
- It's the one Suk Jin did. - This will kill you.

192
00:06:35,780 --> 00:06:37,250
You'll fall from 50m high without a rope.

193
00:06:37,350 --> 00:06:38,510
Without the rope, you'll die.

194
00:06:38,510 --> 00:06:40,780
- There's a net on the bottom. - The net?

195
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:42,520
Indoor skydiving will be hard too.

196
00:06:42,520 --> 00:06:43,720
Kwang Soo and I've done it.

197
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:44,950
- It's no joke. - It goes up and comes down.

198
00:06:44,950 --> 00:06:46,190
- It's scary inside. - Was it fun?

199
00:06:46,290 --> 00:06:47,660
- No, it's scary. - It's scary?

200
00:06:47,660 --> 00:06:49,190
For the indoor skydiving,

201
00:06:49,190 --> 00:06:50,630
you're supposed to fall and not hit the floor,

202
00:06:50,630 --> 00:06:51,630
but you do.

203
00:06:52,730 --> 00:06:54,160
(The crash is an added bonus on top of the fear.)

204
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:56,300
(I think it's your fault.)

205
00:06:56,300 --> 00:06:58,030
It means we can borrow money by doing these penalties?

206
00:06:58,230 --> 00:07:00,640
- You can pay it back with those. - Pay it back? I see.

207
00:07:00,740 --> 00:07:03,710
After changing into your uniform, we'll start the race.

208
00:07:03,710 --> 00:07:05,240
- Go, go. - Let's catch the father.

209
00:07:05,410 --> 00:07:06,540
We ought to.

210
00:07:07,180 --> 00:07:09,840
- Here's your first mission. - Okay.

211
00:07:10,110 --> 00:07:13,480
The member who withdraws the least amount of money will be given...

212
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:15,080
a hint of his or her choice.

213
00:07:15,080 --> 00:07:16,620
It's called Lonely Meal.

214
00:07:16,620 --> 00:07:18,490
- Lonely Meal? - We have to read each other's mind.

215
00:07:19,250 --> 00:07:21,190
- Here's the address. Take it. - What's this?

216
00:07:21,190 --> 00:07:22,220
We have to go somewhere?

217
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:23,860
I want Pyeongyang naengmyeon.

218
00:07:24,290 --> 00:07:25,630
I want Pyeongyang naengmyeon too.

219
00:07:25,630 --> 00:07:27,360
Hey, braised kimchi will be delicious too.

220
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:28,500
All right. Here's your rule.

221
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:30,200
You must choose one of the restaurants...

222
00:07:30,300 --> 00:07:33,230
after looking at the menu and the prices by 1:30pm.

223
00:07:33,430 --> 00:07:35,470
After 1:30pm, the restaurant with the least number...

224
00:07:35,470 --> 00:07:37,940
of members will provide free meals.

225
00:07:39,540 --> 00:07:40,940
There are free meals?

226
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:43,980
The restaurant with the most number of members will charge...

227
00:07:43,980 --> 00:07:45,450
- 10 times the written price. - 10 times?

228
00:07:45,550 --> 00:07:47,080
- 10 times the written price. - 10 times?

229
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:49,080
If the original price is 30 dollars, it will be 300 dollars?

230
00:07:49,780 --> 00:07:52,190
- The 3rd one will be 1,000 dollars. - It's 1,000 dollars.

231
00:07:52,290 --> 00:07:53,420
We'd use up all of our money to begin with.

232
00:07:53,550 --> 00:07:56,160
The team in the middle will pay the original price...

233
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:57,860
and can have the meal.

234
00:07:58,060 --> 00:07:59,260
I just need to be in the middle.

235
00:07:59,260 --> 00:08:00,460
However,

236
00:08:00,460 --> 00:08:03,770
you can change your restaurants freely during your given time.

237
00:08:03,770 --> 00:08:06,400
If you're not at the restaurant when the time is up,

238
00:08:07,070 --> 00:08:09,140
- That person is out. - you'll pay a 2,000-dollar fine.

239
00:08:09,540 --> 00:08:10,740
- What? - It's over then.

240
00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:12,210
- It's over. - That person can't eat...

241
00:08:12,210 --> 00:08:13,410
and will only carry out the penalty.

242
00:08:13,410 --> 00:08:16,510
Hey, it will be hard to pay it back even if I win 6,000 dollars.

243
00:08:16,510 --> 00:08:18,350
Prices on Running Man are so expensive.

244
00:08:18,350 --> 00:08:19,350
- They are so expensive. - Right?

245
00:08:19,350 --> 00:08:21,050
The prices on Running Man are so expensive.

246
00:08:21,050 --> 00:08:23,220
And the member who spent the least amount of money...

247
00:08:23,220 --> 00:08:25,420
will be able to choose to receive a hint...

248
00:08:25,420 --> 00:08:27,490
about the stranger of the father.

249
00:08:27,490 --> 00:08:29,320
Jong Kook, aren't you going to choose Pyeongyang naengmyeon?

250
00:08:29,420 --> 00:08:31,990
- I have to think what I want first. - I want to get the steak.

251
00:08:31,990 --> 00:08:33,490
- But that's the perfect dish now. - It's so hot...

252
00:08:33,490 --> 00:08:35,200
- right now. - That'd be perfect now.

253
00:08:35,260 --> 00:08:36,760
Tell us where you're going to go.

254
00:08:36,760 --> 00:08:38,800
- Okay. Overall, - I want Pyeongyang naengmyeon.

255
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:40,500
Not you. Tell us where you're going to go.

256
00:08:41,470 --> 00:08:42,970
(Not you.)

257
00:08:42,970 --> 00:08:44,370
(Not me?)

258
00:08:44,710 --> 00:08:46,610
(I want an answer from Mr. Straightforward, not Mr. Liar.)

259
00:08:46,610 --> 00:08:48,110
I wasn't even listening to Jae Suk.

260
00:08:48,180 --> 00:08:50,110
- As for me... - Pyeongyang naengmyeon.

261
00:08:50,210 --> 00:08:52,210
- We can set out now, right? - Where should we go?

262
00:08:52,210 --> 00:08:53,510
Gosh, this is crazy.

263
00:08:54,180 --> 00:08:56,780
Hey, we have a lot of time. Do you want to get some tea?

264
00:08:56,780 --> 00:08:59,050
- We have a lot of time. - I'll go somewhere nearby...

265
00:08:59,150 --> 00:09:00,490
and spend some time.

266
00:09:01,020 --> 00:09:03,160
- Who wants Pyeongyang naengmyeon? - I want Pyeongyang naengmyeon.

267
00:09:03,420 --> 00:09:05,860
If you want to switch, you can go on your own.

268
00:09:06,060 --> 00:09:08,030
We'll split the cab fare to the restaurant.

269
00:09:08,030 --> 00:09:09,600
The maximum number of people is 3 for 1 cab.

270
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:10,930
- Is that so? - Really?

271
00:09:10,930 --> 00:09:12,130
Let's kick someone out.

272
00:09:12,130 --> 00:09:13,400
Whoever loses rock-paper-scissors can leave.

273
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:14,940
- That person is out? - Yes.

274
00:09:14,940 --> 00:09:16,200
- That person can't come with us. - All right.

275
00:09:16,470 --> 00:09:18,010
- Ready or not, rock-paper-scissors - Rock-paper-scissors

276
00:09:18,140 --> 00:09:20,070
(Se Chan wins with paper.)

277
00:09:20,070 --> 00:09:21,610
- Okay. - One more round.

278
00:09:21,640 --> 00:09:23,340
- Ready or not, rock-paper-scissors - Rock-paper-scissors

279
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:24,510
- Ready or not, rock-paper-scissors - Rock-paper-scissors

280
00:09:24,510 --> 00:09:25,780
(Kwang Soo wins with scissors.)

281
00:09:25,780 --> 00:09:26,850
Okay!

282
00:09:26,850 --> 00:09:29,080
(We can carpool together.)

283
00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:31,450
(The outcome of the last round of rock-paper-scissors...)

284
00:09:31,450 --> 00:09:32,650
(is Ji Hyo's loss.)

285
00:09:32,650 --> 00:09:33,720
- Okay. - Let's go.

286
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:35,860
- Take the cab by yourself. - Bye.

287
00:09:36,060 --> 00:09:37,290
- Hey. - To Pyeongyang naengmyeon, right?

288
00:09:37,290 --> 00:09:39,790
- You'll go there first, right? - Yes.

289
00:09:39,860 --> 00:09:41,330
We'll settle who pays for the cab...

290
00:09:41,530 --> 00:09:43,030
- on the way there. - Okay.

291
00:09:44,470 --> 00:09:46,470
I have to read their moves.

292
00:09:46,830 --> 00:09:49,300
(Ji Hyo is all alone now.)

293
00:09:49,300 --> 00:09:51,710
(Looking up the address)

294
00:09:54,110 --> 00:09:55,240
No way.

295
00:09:55,380 --> 00:09:57,150
I was going to walk, but it will take an hour.

296
00:09:57,450 --> 00:09:59,550
3.8km. This is crazy.

297
00:10:00,450 --> 00:10:01,820
(Gosh, what should I do?)

298
00:10:01,820 --> 00:10:02,850
What should I do?

299
00:10:03,050 --> 00:10:05,950
(Will she take the taxi by herself? Or will she walk?)

300
00:10:06,090 --> 00:10:07,260
Waffle with apple-flavored whipped cream.

301
00:10:07,390 --> 00:10:08,960
- You're buying? - Of course.

302
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:10,290
Really? Thank you.

303
00:10:10,290 --> 00:10:12,630
It's cheaper since it's near a university, right?

304
00:10:13,260 --> 00:10:14,700
I see. That's our waffle?

305
00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:16,500
My gosh, this is huge.

306
00:10:16,500 --> 00:10:17,800
- Look. Sure. - Thank you.

307
00:10:17,870 --> 00:10:19,300
- I'll enjoy this. - Okay.

308
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:21,740
I didn't know it was thick like this.

309
00:10:21,740 --> 00:10:24,640
It's thick just like the one from Sookmyung Women's University.

310
00:10:25,310 --> 00:10:27,140
- My gosh. - I can't bite it in one go.

311
00:10:28,140 --> 00:10:29,280
My chin hurts.

312
00:10:29,280 --> 00:10:31,550
(Opening wide)

313
00:10:31,550 --> 00:10:33,410
(In approval)

314
00:10:34,980 --> 00:10:36,020
(The flavor calls for an approval.)

315
00:10:36,020 --> 00:10:37,720
- It's not bad. - It's good.

316
00:10:37,750 --> 00:10:38,890
- It's good. - This is what I wanted.

317
00:10:38,890 --> 00:10:39,920
Take a seat.

318
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:41,320
I feel bad that you spent four dollars.

319
00:10:41,690 --> 00:10:43,060
(Chuckling)

320
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:44,790
It's not bad.

321
00:10:44,860 --> 00:10:47,330
- I think Se Chan might have a role. - This is not bad.

322
00:10:47,530 --> 00:10:48,830
- Right? - Yes. It's about time...

323
00:10:48,830 --> 00:10:50,300
that he had a role today.

324
00:10:50,300 --> 00:10:51,930
Did you see how he was so quiet earlier?

325
00:10:52,300 --> 00:10:53,370
It's about time that he had a role.

326
00:10:53,530 --> 00:10:56,070
And during the opening segment, when our eyes met,

327
00:10:56,070 --> 00:10:58,040
I saw your eyes shaking.

328
00:10:59,170 --> 00:11:01,080
- You're the father, right? - It's not me. I swear.

329
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:02,710
You're the father, aren't you? Look me in the eye.

330
00:11:02,910 --> 00:11:04,010
Where are you?

331
00:11:04,450 --> 00:11:05,810
We're on our way to...

332
00:11:05,810 --> 00:11:07,550
- "We"? The four of us... - With whom?

333
00:11:07,550 --> 00:11:08,880
are going to the Pyeongyang naengmyeon restaurant.

334
00:11:09,180 --> 00:11:10,320
Who's there?

335
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:11,350
Including myself,

336
00:11:11,950 --> 00:11:13,720
it's Haha, Kwang Soo, and Jong Kook.

337
00:11:13,720 --> 00:11:17,230
(Including myself, it's Haha, Kwang Soo, and Jong Kook.)

338
00:11:17,230 --> 00:11:19,530
(How could he say Jong Kook's name?)

339
00:11:19,990 --> 00:11:21,130
Hey.

340
00:11:21,300 --> 00:11:22,900
What did you say? Say that again.

341
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,230
- Hey. - Hello?

342
00:11:24,230 --> 00:11:25,500
What did you say? Say that again.

343
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:26,870
- We're at the noodles restaurant. - It's Haha,

344
00:11:26,870 --> 00:11:29,200
Kwang Soo, and Jong Kook. It's the four of us here.

345
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:32,140
- Jong Kook is there? - Yes. What?

346
00:11:32,140 --> 00:11:33,670
- Se Chan. - Hey, Jong Kook. Hello?

347
00:11:33,670 --> 00:11:34,980
He's really there.

348
00:11:34,980 --> 00:11:36,110
He hung up on him.

349
00:11:36,340 --> 00:11:37,710
- I got so scared for a second. - So Min...

350
00:11:37,950 --> 00:11:39,080
Se Chan.

351
00:11:39,080 --> 00:11:40,310
Hey, Jong Kook. Hello?

352
00:11:41,520 --> 00:11:42,580
Se Chan.

353
00:11:42,580 --> 00:11:44,020
He hung up.

354
00:11:44,020 --> 00:11:45,620
(You hung up? You punk, Se Chan!)

355
00:11:45,620 --> 00:11:47,790
In my opinion, I think Kwang Soo and Se Chan are going to...

356
00:11:47,790 --> 00:11:49,820
- the restaurant together. - Right. And...

357
00:11:49,820 --> 00:11:51,630
He doesn't want you to choose that restaurant.

358
00:11:52,260 --> 00:11:53,760
- He said there are a lot of people. - He pretended it was crowded.

359
00:11:55,160 --> 00:11:56,530
Which restaurant will you go to?

360
00:11:56,660 --> 00:11:58,170
Doesn't your gut tell you...

361
00:11:58,170 --> 00:11:59,430
to go to the steakhouse?

362
00:11:59,430 --> 00:12:01,340
- I'm going there. Yes. - To the steakhouse?

363
00:12:01,540 --> 00:12:02,840
I think this place will be good.

364
00:12:02,900 --> 00:12:04,710
- Is that so? - I'll just follow you for now.

365
00:12:04,710 --> 00:12:05,810
(Sure.)

366
00:12:05,810 --> 00:12:07,110
- Let's go. - See? He's so cool.

367
00:12:07,110 --> 00:12:08,180
He didn't tell me to pay for my own.

368
00:12:08,180 --> 00:12:09,880
- He'll pay for the taxi. - Of course.

369
00:12:09,940 --> 00:12:11,050
Gosh, of course.

370
00:12:11,050 --> 00:12:12,950
I don't ask people to pay for me.

371
00:12:12,950 --> 00:12:14,080
- This is nice. - You know?

372
00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:16,520
(They head to the restaurant that serves seafood stew and steaks.)

373
00:12:17,020 --> 00:12:19,020
Gosh, I got stuck with these guys.

374
00:12:19,550 --> 00:12:20,990
I'll definitely beat you guys.

375
00:12:20,990 --> 00:12:23,020
I'm going to stay at the restaurant. You've been informed.

376
00:12:23,020 --> 00:12:24,960
- That's also a way to do this. - I'll just sit there.

377
00:12:24,990 --> 00:12:26,060
That's cool.

378
00:12:26,060 --> 00:12:27,700
How about this? Say that the three of us are sitting there.

379
00:12:27,700 --> 00:12:30,060
If someone else joins, it will be four of us, so no one will join.

380
00:12:30,060 --> 00:12:32,400
- Whoever loses the game... - He'll leave?

381
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:33,830
- When the time is up, he'll leave. - Okay.

382
00:12:33,830 --> 00:12:35,570
- That's fair. - Great.

383
00:12:35,870 --> 00:12:37,000
How much money do you have?

384
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,140
30 dollars.

385
00:12:39,610 --> 00:12:41,080
Gosh, he's so stingy.

386
00:12:42,010 --> 00:12:44,080
- You don't have any guts. - It's not that.

387
00:12:44,080 --> 00:12:46,180
I don't need more than 30 dollars. Why would I borrow more?

388
00:12:46,380 --> 00:12:47,450
He's so petty.

389
00:12:47,450 --> 00:12:49,480
I bet Scrooge wasn't as stingy as he is, right?

390
00:12:49,480 --> 00:12:50,820
I'm not being stingy.

391
00:12:50,820 --> 00:12:51,890
How come...

392
00:12:51,890 --> 00:12:53,420
Be honest. Have you ever bought stuff for me?

393
00:12:53,420 --> 00:12:55,490
(Hey, Greedy Millipede.)

394
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:58,090
Why are you asking me that all of a sudden?

395
00:12:58,290 --> 00:13:01,060
You always forget to bring a wallet whenever we hang out.

396
00:13:01,830 --> 00:13:04,000
- He really does that? - It was a mistake.

397
00:13:04,100 --> 00:13:05,270
- How many times have you done that? - This...

398
00:13:05,270 --> 00:13:07,000
You can't bring that up here.

399
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,170
- I'm serious. - I'm so disappointed.

400
00:13:08,170 --> 00:13:09,670
I told you. I believe that people should act the same...

401
00:13:09,670 --> 00:13:10,940
- Kwang Soo. - off and on camera.

402
00:13:10,940 --> 00:13:13,210
A while ago, he and I had a meal together.

403
00:13:13,210 --> 00:13:15,280
- It was time to pay for our meal. - Okay.

404
00:13:15,280 --> 00:13:17,310
- He was hesitating. - Are you serious?

405
00:13:17,310 --> 00:13:19,410
(He was hesitating.)

406
00:13:19,410 --> 00:13:20,750
"Hesitating"?

407
00:13:21,380 --> 00:13:22,720
- Se Chan's younger than you. - So I...

408
00:13:23,750 --> 00:13:25,090
You're amazing.

409
00:13:25,090 --> 00:13:27,150
So I gave up on him.

410
00:13:27,150 --> 00:13:29,560
You're going to tattoo that character on me?

411
00:13:29,890 --> 00:13:31,760
(Laughing)

412
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:33,960
I'm sorry, sir. I laughed too loudly.

413
00:13:34,730 --> 00:13:35,830
This is it.

414
00:13:35,830 --> 00:13:36,830
Please stop here.

415
00:13:36,830 --> 00:13:38,030
(They arrive at the Pyeongyang naengmyeon place.)

416
00:13:38,030 --> 00:13:40,230
- Ready or not, rock-paper-scissors - Rock-paper-scissors

417
00:13:40,230 --> 00:13:41,440
- Okay! - Let's go.

418
00:13:41,740 --> 00:13:43,040
Okay.

419
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:44,040
(Haha will pay.)

420
00:13:44,040 --> 00:13:45,110
That was a free cab ride.

421
00:13:45,110 --> 00:13:47,140
- Thanks, Haha. - Thanks.

422
00:13:48,540 --> 00:13:50,780
I want some ice cream. We have enough time.

423
00:13:50,780 --> 00:13:51,910
We do.

424
00:13:51,980 --> 00:13:53,410
Should we bet on ice cream?

425
00:13:53,410 --> 00:13:54,520
Of course.

426
00:13:54,680 --> 00:13:56,120
- Hey. - What is it?

427
00:13:56,120 --> 00:13:57,920
Look at you trembling.

428
00:13:57,920 --> 00:14:00,050
He's hesitating again. Come on.

429
00:14:00,050 --> 00:14:02,020
- I do use my money. - Then do you want to pay?

430
00:14:02,020 --> 00:14:03,360
- No, I don't. - No?

431
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:05,190
I'm not craving ice cream.

432
00:14:05,190 --> 00:14:06,260
What?

433
00:14:06,260 --> 00:14:08,000
Hey. Hey.

434
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,700
If I bought some, would you have eaten?

435
00:14:09,900 --> 00:14:12,500
If you buy one, I'll eat it.

436
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:13,800
(He changes his attitude.)

437
00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:14,800
But...

438
00:14:15,500 --> 00:14:16,670
But that's not why.

439
00:14:16,670 --> 00:14:18,010
I'll lend you some money.

440
00:14:18,010 --> 00:14:19,610
Spend some money.

441
00:14:19,610 --> 00:14:21,010
Are we going to have ice cream from the supermarket?

442
00:14:21,140 --> 00:14:22,740
- What? Hey. - Are we going Baskin-Robbins?

443
00:14:22,740 --> 00:14:24,050
- Of course. - Hey!

444
00:14:24,380 --> 00:14:25,450
- What? - What?

445
00:14:25,450 --> 00:14:26,610
That's a bit...

446
00:14:26,610 --> 00:14:27,920
- What? - Are you being a Scrooge?

447
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:29,420
- Fine, let's go. - Okay.

448
00:14:29,950 --> 00:14:31,720
I'm not craving ice cream.

449
00:14:32,820 --> 00:14:33,890
How about this?

450
00:14:33,890 --> 00:14:34,890
(He proposes a deal.)

451
00:14:34,890 --> 00:14:36,920
The person the worker chooses will pay.

452
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:38,730
- Okay. - All right.

453
00:14:38,830 --> 00:14:39,930
Will you be all right?

454
00:14:40,030 --> 00:14:41,300
You seem to be confident.

455
00:14:41,460 --> 00:14:43,660
Your fame will play a part.

456
00:14:43,960 --> 00:14:45,600
- Hello. - Hello.

457
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:46,600
Hello.

458
00:14:46,770 --> 00:14:49,240
- Pick your flavor first. - I'd like...

459
00:14:49,240 --> 00:14:51,940
- Cherry Jubilee. - I'd like Almond Bongbong.

460
00:14:52,470 --> 00:14:54,680
I'd like Gone with the Wind.

461
00:14:54,680 --> 00:14:55,980
Gone with the Wind?

462
00:14:56,080 --> 00:14:57,950
- It's 9 dollars and 90 cents. - How much?

463
00:14:57,950 --> 00:14:59,210
9 dollars and 90 cents?

464
00:14:59,210 --> 00:15:00,550
Among us,

465
00:15:01,420 --> 00:15:03,220
who would you like to pay for it?

466
00:15:03,220 --> 00:15:04,550
- You see... - Be fair.

467
00:15:05,190 --> 00:15:07,250
- Just pick one. - Anyone.

468
00:15:07,420 --> 00:15:08,620
Who would it be?

469
00:15:08,620 --> 00:15:11,360
(She picks Kwang Soo.)

470
00:15:12,830 --> 00:15:14,800
(Kwang Soo, the star, will pay.)

471
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:16,560
(Me?)

472
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:18,970
(We don't need to pay!)

473
00:15:18,970 --> 00:15:21,470
Then please take out Gone with the Wind.

474
00:15:21,470 --> 00:15:23,240
- No. - Just give all three, please.

475
00:15:23,240 --> 00:15:24,610
- It's already included. - I don't want ice cream.

476
00:15:24,610 --> 00:15:26,040
- Come on. - It's already in there.

477
00:15:26,040 --> 00:15:27,310
- Give it to a staff member. - Right.

478
00:15:27,310 --> 00:15:28,340
(His face becomes pale.)

479
00:15:28,340 --> 00:15:29,680
It's already registered here.

480
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:31,180
(Kwang Soo spends 9 dollars and 90 cents.)

481
00:15:31,180 --> 00:15:33,550
- Thank you. - I'm really not craving it.

482
00:15:34,920 --> 00:15:38,150
Why do you always hesitate when you're in front of the register?

483
00:15:38,850 --> 00:15:40,390
- Why? - What do you mean?

484
00:15:40,390 --> 00:15:42,320
You should've just paid.

485
00:15:42,760 --> 00:15:43,960
You were trembling.

486
00:15:43,960 --> 00:15:45,490
What are you filming?

487
00:15:45,590 --> 00:15:47,800
- You're trembling. - What do you mean?

488
00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:50,160
- I'm not trembling. - It's as if you lost your savings.

489
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:51,330
It's only 9 dollars and 90 cents.

490
00:15:51,330 --> 00:15:52,930
Can't you be a bit more generous?

491
00:15:53,770 --> 00:15:55,040
Now that it has come to this...

492
00:15:55,500 --> 00:15:56,570
Okay.

493
00:15:56,700 --> 00:15:57,870
Fine.

494
00:15:59,110 --> 00:16:01,480
I know how I'll be acting today. Okay.

495
00:16:01,480 --> 00:16:03,440
(While Kwang Soo is in pain for having spent his money...)

496
00:16:03,540 --> 00:16:05,810
- Until 1:30pm? - Yes.

497
00:16:06,850 --> 00:16:09,720
(Ji Hyo decides to walk.)

498
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:12,490
(It's been 30 minutes.)

499
00:16:12,820 --> 00:16:14,490
(She changes her destination to a nearby place.)

500
00:16:14,490 --> 00:16:15,790
I'm almost there.

501
00:16:17,260 --> 00:16:18,490
I found it.

502
00:16:18,690 --> 00:16:20,290
It's over there.

503
00:16:20,290 --> 00:16:21,730
(She enters a braised kimchi restaurant.)

504
00:16:22,100 --> 00:16:23,560
(If Jae Suk and Suk Jin aren't here,)

505
00:16:23,560 --> 00:16:25,000
(she'll most likely win.)

506
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,030
(She went through so much to save money.)

507
00:16:26,030 --> 00:16:28,740
(How many people are here?)

508
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:30,240
No one's here?

509
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:33,040
(It's 12:45pm, and for now, there's no one.)

510
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:34,480
Are they not hiding in there?

511
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:36,940
(If no one else comes, she'll get to eat for free.)

512
00:16:38,010 --> 00:16:40,610
I chose coffee over a cab.

513
00:16:42,120 --> 00:16:43,320
It's so cool.

514
00:16:44,550 --> 00:16:46,120
No one's here.

515
00:16:46,120 --> 00:16:47,190
Hello.

516
00:16:47,490 --> 00:16:48,790
No one came before us, right?

517
00:16:48,790 --> 00:16:50,320
No, it's not time yet.

518
00:16:50,460 --> 00:16:52,690
- One of us will have to leave. - Right.

519
00:16:53,030 --> 00:16:54,260
Let's play a game.

520
00:16:54,260 --> 00:16:57,060
For your information, we've already prepared a game.

521
00:16:57,060 --> 00:16:59,930
- Really? - First one is Word ASMR.

522
00:16:59,930 --> 00:17:02,170
We will write something.

523
00:17:02,170 --> 00:17:04,610
You must listen to the sound.

524
00:17:04,610 --> 00:17:07,040
- That's great. - Let's do that.

525
00:17:07,040 --> 00:17:09,240
- ASMR is nice. - I did it often during radio shows.

526
00:17:09,440 --> 00:17:10,980
- Then let's do something else. - Yes.

527
00:17:10,980 --> 00:17:13,410
I was the one writing, not guessing.

528
00:17:13,410 --> 00:17:15,150
If you get the first question right, we're going to start all over.

529
00:17:15,150 --> 00:17:16,850
- That's ridiculous. - It's not.

530
00:17:16,850 --> 00:17:18,290
It's... Wait, it's not?

531
00:17:18,350 --> 00:17:19,720
- No. - Okay.

532
00:17:19,720 --> 00:17:21,990
- Please start. - Put on your eye masks.

533
00:17:21,990 --> 00:17:24,630
(They will cover their eyes.)

534
00:17:24,790 --> 00:17:26,530
- You better not peek. - We have 20 minutes.

535
00:17:26,530 --> 00:17:28,600
If you peek, you're out.

536
00:17:28,600 --> 00:17:29,830
Of course.

537
00:17:30,660 --> 00:17:32,670
- You shouldn't peek. - Okay.

538
00:17:33,130 --> 00:17:35,670
If someone's cheating, please tell us.

539
00:17:35,670 --> 00:17:36,870
- Okay. - That's not right.

540
00:17:36,870 --> 00:17:38,310
- You must cover your eyes. - I'll keep an eye.

541
00:17:38,310 --> 00:17:40,540
- Okay. - If that happens, I'll restart.

542
00:17:40,540 --> 00:17:41,640
Get ready...

543
00:17:41,640 --> 00:17:42,780
(Haha's ready.)

544
00:17:43,310 --> 00:17:44,910
- What? - What?

545
00:17:44,910 --> 00:17:47,450
(Did they all cover properly?)

546
00:17:47,450 --> 00:17:48,980
(Why aren't you wearing yours?)

547
00:17:48,980 --> 00:17:50,680
- What is this? - Gosh.

548
00:17:50,680 --> 00:17:52,520
Let's not do this. We need to play the game.

549
00:17:52,820 --> 00:17:54,360
Someone needs to leave.

550
00:17:54,360 --> 00:17:56,120
How could not a single one of us keep the promise?

551
00:17:56,120 --> 00:17:57,760
- Come on. - This is only the beginning.

552
00:17:57,760 --> 00:18:00,460
- This is a simple game. - Then lie face forward.

553
00:18:00,460 --> 00:18:01,630
(They decide to lie face forward.)

554
00:18:01,630 --> 00:18:03,400
- Okay. - I'll start once you lie down.

555
00:18:03,400 --> 00:18:04,670
(They decide to cover their eyes and lie down.)

556
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,370
(Looking around)

557
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:10,670
- Let me put this up. - Wait.

558
00:18:10,670 --> 00:18:13,510
(His eyes are visible.)

559
00:18:13,510 --> 00:18:15,740
Hey, our eyes locked.

560
00:18:16,540 --> 00:18:19,350
- I don't want to do this. - Let's not.

561
00:18:19,350 --> 00:18:21,180
Don't do that.

562
00:18:21,620 --> 00:18:23,520
Or let's look at each other.

563
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:26,450
That's good. Give me a page of the sketchbook.

564
00:18:26,790 --> 00:18:28,460
- We'll be behind it. - My gosh.

565
00:18:28,560 --> 00:18:31,290
- Is this supposed to be this hard? - Is this...

566
00:18:31,290 --> 00:18:32,690
Gather around.

567
00:18:33,560 --> 00:18:35,300
- Raise this. - Then I can see.

568
00:18:35,300 --> 00:18:36,630
- Really? - Yes.

569
00:18:36,630 --> 00:18:38,400
This is impossible to see.

570
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:39,670
(Now, we're done.)

571
00:18:40,570 --> 00:18:42,070
- No? - Fine.

572
00:18:42,070 --> 00:18:43,240
Fine.

573
00:18:43,240 --> 00:18:44,740
Fine, I'll stoop.

574
00:18:44,740 --> 00:18:45,840
(Thanks to Se Chan's apology, they try one more time.)

575
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:47,840
It's... Come on.

576
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:51,410
(Glancing)

577
00:18:52,710 --> 00:18:56,120
- All right. Let's really do it. - What was that?

578
00:18:56,120 --> 00:18:58,020
- Let's do it. - Seriously.

579
00:18:58,020 --> 00:19:00,890
We've been here for 15 minutes but haven't played a single game.

580
00:19:01,020 --> 00:19:02,520
How will we cover our eyes?

581
00:19:03,090 --> 00:19:05,730
We just need to cover it like this.

582
00:19:05,730 --> 00:19:06,760
But no one's doing it.

583
00:19:06,760 --> 00:19:08,430
- Is this... - Who is that?

584
00:19:08,760 --> 00:19:10,430
- Is this... - Who is that?

585
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:12,900
- Why are you here? - You really came?

586
00:19:13,300 --> 00:19:16,500
Is this the place with the most people?

587
00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:17,970
What's wrong with you today?

588
00:19:17,970 --> 00:19:19,040
What?

589
00:19:19,040 --> 00:19:20,980
He doesn't know when to back off. He really came.

590
00:19:20,980 --> 00:19:22,510
Is he the stranger?

591
00:19:22,510 --> 00:19:23,540
You can't come here.

592
00:19:23,540 --> 00:19:25,050
- Are you... - Are you staying here?

593
00:19:25,050 --> 00:19:26,050
Of course.

594
00:19:26,310 --> 00:19:28,280
How about this? Two people will leave.

595
00:19:28,280 --> 00:19:29,320
- Okay. - Let's do that.

596
00:19:29,320 --> 00:19:30,480
Three will leave.

597
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:31,690
- Three? - You'll be alone?

598
00:19:31,690 --> 00:19:33,120
I'm all for it.

599
00:19:33,420 --> 00:19:35,620
- Okay. - But you can't come back ever.

600
00:19:35,620 --> 00:19:36,790
- Let's keep that promise. - Seriously.

601
00:19:36,790 --> 00:19:38,130
- Keep it. - Okay.

602
00:19:38,130 --> 00:19:39,660
- You can't come back. - This is a rule.

603
00:19:39,660 --> 00:19:41,160
- But if one person... - The stakes are high.

604
00:19:41,160 --> 00:19:43,200
If only 1 person is here, they'll probably come 1st place.

605
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:44,200
Right.

606
00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:45,700
The last number is 24.

607
00:19:45,700 --> 00:19:48,240
- You can press it 3 or 4 times. - It opens early, though.

608
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:49,300
- Am I the last? - Yes.

609
00:19:49,300 --> 00:19:51,170
It doesn't matter how many times you press the doorbell.

610
00:19:51,170 --> 00:19:52,240
It's your choice.

611
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:53,370
(Ringing)

612
00:19:53,370 --> 00:19:55,110
- If you fail... What is it? - My gosh.

613
00:19:55,840 --> 00:19:56,940
(What is it?)

614
00:19:56,940 --> 00:19:58,410
- Why is he here? - You really came?

615
00:19:58,550 --> 00:20:00,280
My gosh.

616
00:20:00,280 --> 00:20:02,280
- This is driving me crazy. - We need to send four people.

617
00:20:02,280 --> 00:20:03,650
- Hurry up and play the game. - We need to hurry.

618
00:20:03,650 --> 00:20:05,250
- Hurry over. - We need to send four people.

619
00:20:05,250 --> 00:20:06,590
- What's going on? - We need to send four people.

620
00:20:06,590 --> 00:20:08,160
- We're running out of time. - We need to send four.

621
00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:09,890
If you win, you'll come first place no matter what.

622
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:12,260
- We'll be sending four? - If you lose, leave immediately.

623
00:20:12,260 --> 00:20:14,630
- This is the order. - If you lose, you have to leave.

624
00:20:14,700 --> 00:20:16,300
- The last survivor wins. - Get ready.

625
00:20:16,460 --> 00:20:17,900
You can't come back.

626
00:20:17,900 --> 00:20:19,370
Okay. Go.

627
00:20:19,370 --> 00:20:20,500
(They can press it as many times as they want.)

628
00:20:20,900 --> 00:20:23,300
(Ringing)

629
00:20:23,300 --> 00:20:25,510
(Haha loses.)

630
00:20:26,070 --> 00:20:27,140
(Go!)

631
00:20:27,140 --> 00:20:28,740
- Go! - Leave!

632
00:20:28,740 --> 00:20:30,310
- Hold on. - Leave!

633
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:32,050
- Get lost! - Darn it.

634
00:20:32,280 --> 00:20:33,410
Go out.

635
00:20:33,410 --> 00:20:34,680
(Poor Haha gets kicked out.)

636
00:20:34,680 --> 00:20:36,550
- Leave. - Leave.

637
00:20:36,550 --> 00:20:38,320
- Get out. - Let me watch.

638
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:40,250
- Go. - Follow the rule.

639
00:20:40,250 --> 00:20:41,690
You can't come back.

640
00:20:42,390 --> 00:20:44,160
- All right. - You can't press it three times.

641
00:20:46,030 --> 00:20:47,430
It'll open before it's my turn.

642
00:20:48,300 --> 00:20:50,860
Okay, I'm done.

643
00:20:51,130 --> 00:20:52,200
Suk Jin.

644
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:53,500
- That's it? - Yes.

645
00:20:53,500 --> 00:20:54,670
Don't be sly like that.

646
00:20:54,670 --> 00:20:55,800
- Why not? - Hey.

647
00:20:55,800 --> 00:20:56,940
- How is that being sly? - Come on.

648
00:20:56,940 --> 00:20:58,240
You have no courage.

649
00:20:58,240 --> 00:20:59,640
No, I don't. I think the limit is five.

650
00:20:59,640 --> 00:21:01,510
You won't succeed in life.

651
00:21:01,510 --> 00:21:02,810
It's Suk Jin and then Jae Suk.

652
00:21:04,280 --> 00:21:05,410
- Is that it? - Yes.

653
00:21:08,380 --> 00:21:11,790
(Ringing)

654
00:21:12,250 --> 00:21:14,420
(He suddenly transforms himself into a courageous man.)

655
00:21:14,420 --> 00:21:15,560
You pressed three times?

656
00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:18,560
(That petty-minded guy pressed three times?)

657
00:21:18,560 --> 00:21:19,960
I bet it'll come out.

658
00:21:21,160 --> 00:21:22,660
- Okay. - You pressed one time?

659
00:21:22,660 --> 00:21:23,800
One more time?

660
00:21:23,800 --> 00:21:24,800
(He decides to press it one more time.)

661
00:21:24,800 --> 00:21:26,530
- It sounds like it'll open soon. - Press it one more time.

662
00:21:26,530 --> 00:21:27,770
- 1 more time. No, 2 more times. - 1 more time.

663
00:21:27,770 --> 00:21:29,100
- Once? - Once.

664
00:21:29,240 --> 00:21:30,640
You can press it two times too.

665
00:21:32,270 --> 00:21:33,970
(Opening)

666
00:21:34,710 --> 00:21:35,910
(His greed gets the best of him.)

667
00:21:35,910 --> 00:21:37,740
- Get out. - Get out.

668
00:21:37,810 --> 00:21:39,110
Get out.

669
00:21:39,180 --> 00:21:40,250
Hurry up.

670
00:21:40,450 --> 00:21:41,680
- Get out. - Get out.

671
00:21:41,680 --> 00:21:43,980
- Why didn't he stop after once? - I know.

672
00:21:43,980 --> 00:21:45,320
- Why didn't you stop? - Why were you greedy?

673
00:21:45,490 --> 00:21:47,920
- You better follow the rule. - I will.

674
00:21:47,920 --> 00:21:48,990
Don't come back.

675
00:21:48,990 --> 00:21:50,060
This is driving me crazy.

676
00:21:50,060 --> 00:21:51,990
- Is it me or you? Which way is it? - This way.

677
00:21:51,990 --> 00:21:53,130
- It's me? - I'm so disappointed.

678
00:21:54,190 --> 00:21:55,400
Open, open, open.

679
00:21:55,400 --> 00:21:57,000
- Press it hard. - I did.

680
00:21:57,460 --> 00:21:59,300
You're so petty.

681
00:21:59,400 --> 00:22:00,770
- Seriously. - You're so petty.

682
00:22:00,770 --> 00:22:02,040
You're seriously...

683
00:22:02,040 --> 00:22:04,400
What's the point of surviving through such petty ways?

684
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:06,740
- His heart is as big as a teaspoon. - A teaspoon?

685
00:22:06,910 --> 00:22:08,210
It's over.

686
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:10,180
- Okay! - Get out!

687
00:22:10,180 --> 00:22:11,680
(Jae Suk is eliminated at once.)

688
00:22:12,050 --> 00:22:13,180
Get out.

689
00:22:13,650 --> 00:22:15,080
- Get out. - Don't say a thing.

690
00:22:15,320 --> 00:22:16,450
Get out.

691
00:22:16,580 --> 00:22:17,950
- Is it my turn? - Yes.

692
00:22:17,950 --> 00:22:19,120
(Here comes the final round.)

693
00:22:19,320 --> 00:22:21,050
(Ringing)

694
00:22:21,050 --> 00:22:22,490
Why are you so good?

695
00:22:23,060 --> 00:22:24,390
(Please)

696
00:22:27,190 --> 00:22:28,560
(Suk Jin wins.)

697
00:22:28,560 --> 00:22:30,100
Get out and never come back.

698
00:22:30,100 --> 00:22:31,160
Does this make any sense?

699
00:22:31,160 --> 00:22:32,270
You promised.

700
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:34,170
Get out and never come back.

701
00:22:34,300 --> 00:22:35,870
- Let's go out for now. - Okay.

702
00:22:35,870 --> 00:22:37,000
- A promise is a promise. - It's a promise.

703
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:38,110
Let's keep the promise.

704
00:22:38,270 --> 00:22:39,870
Don't ever come back. Get out.

705
00:22:39,870 --> 00:22:41,170
Gosh, he's amazing.

706
00:22:41,170 --> 00:22:42,210
- He came... - I've...

707
00:22:42,210 --> 00:22:43,280
- and succeeded. - succeeded.

708
00:22:43,810 --> 00:22:45,350
I made it. Okay.

709
00:22:45,780 --> 00:22:47,210
I can't believe I won.

710
00:22:47,210 --> 00:22:48,380
(His petty character brought victory to him.)

711
00:22:48,380 --> 00:22:49,420
I won.

712
00:22:49,480 --> 00:22:50,950
We've come out.

713
00:22:50,950 --> 00:22:55,290
Let's play a game to have one person enter.

714
00:22:55,690 --> 00:22:57,420
- Enter where? - This restaurant.

715
00:22:57,720 --> 00:22:59,330
- He shouldn't win. - We should go in.

716
00:22:59,330 --> 00:23:01,300
And he wasn't present when we were talking about the rules.

717
00:23:01,300 --> 00:23:03,360
- Why did he butt in? - Exactly.

718
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:05,400
- This was our agreement. - Right.

719
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:07,500
- One person will go in. - Let's play it.

720
00:23:07,700 --> 00:23:09,200
Let's play rock-paper-scissors.

721
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:10,700
- Let's make it simple. - Okay.

722
00:23:10,700 --> 00:23:11,940
- Rock-paper-scissors - Rock-paper-scissors

723
00:23:11,940 --> 00:23:13,140
(Se Chan wins.)

724
00:23:13,140 --> 00:23:14,170
Okay!

725
00:23:14,410 --> 00:23:16,140
(It only ended up benefiting someone else.)

726
00:23:16,280 --> 00:23:17,310
Just like that?

727
00:23:17,310 --> 00:23:19,810
(Se Chan heads back into the restaurant.)

728
00:23:19,810 --> 00:23:20,850
How much time is left?

729
00:23:22,450 --> 00:23:23,980
I can't believe I got so lucky.

730
00:23:23,980 --> 00:23:25,490
- Hey. - I got lucky.

731
00:23:25,490 --> 00:23:26,850
- What's going on? - We played rock-paper-scissors...

732
00:23:26,850 --> 00:23:28,860
so that one person could go back inside.

733
00:23:28,860 --> 00:23:30,660
Get out of here. Seriously?

734
00:23:30,660 --> 00:23:32,130
(He's extremely flustered.)

735
00:23:32,130 --> 00:23:33,660
But I won the game.

736
00:23:33,660 --> 00:23:35,430
I won the game outside.

737
00:23:35,430 --> 00:23:38,200
There are a different set of rules outside, you know.

738
00:23:38,270 --> 00:23:40,600
What are you talking about?

739
00:23:40,600 --> 00:23:41,970
You were just supposed to leave.

740
00:23:41,970 --> 00:23:43,000
What are you doing back here?

741
00:23:43,540 --> 00:23:45,040
- You... - What's going on?

742
00:23:45,040 --> 00:23:46,710
(They spot someone.)

743
00:23:47,110 --> 00:23:49,540
We played a game to decide who gets to stay.

744
00:23:50,010 --> 00:23:52,310
- What? - The game here was over,

745
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:53,910
so we played a new one outside.

746
00:23:53,910 --> 00:23:54,920
What?

747
00:23:56,050 --> 00:23:57,550
This restaurant will win for sure then.

748
00:23:58,120 --> 00:23:59,390
(They can't let that happen.)

749
00:23:59,390 --> 00:24:00,990
Let's sneak inside and eat.

750
00:24:00,990 --> 00:24:03,260
We'll play Palm Face Down or Up...

751
00:24:03,260 --> 00:24:05,360
and let one more person stay.

752
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:06,730
Palm Face Down or Up

753
00:24:07,930 --> 00:24:08,960
Nice!

754
00:24:09,530 --> 00:24:11,330
- Hold on. - It's not all too bad.

755
00:24:11,330 --> 00:24:12,570
Okay, you stay there.

756
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:14,740
We should go our separate ways.

757
00:24:14,840 --> 00:24:16,440
That we should.

758
00:24:16,440 --> 00:24:17,440
(And so Haha and Jae Suk head somewhere else.)

759
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:18,910
- That's not it. - What?

760
00:24:18,910 --> 00:24:20,240
We played a new game.

761
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:22,080
Right, then that's that.

762
00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:23,640
- It's over then. - Let's play another game.

763
00:24:23,640 --> 00:24:24,850
- But... - We'll play another game...

764
00:24:24,850 --> 00:24:26,010
and send someone away.

765
00:24:26,010 --> 00:24:27,110
Only one will stay.

766
00:24:27,480 --> 00:24:29,280
Unbelievable.

767
00:24:29,280 --> 00:24:30,620
Okay.

768
00:24:30,980 --> 00:24:32,550
- Does it end exactly at 2:30pm? - Yes.

769
00:24:32,550 --> 00:24:35,520
The other four can't come back here.

770
00:24:36,190 --> 00:24:37,260
(They have 25 minutes left.)

771
00:24:37,260 --> 00:24:38,530
There isn't much time left.

772
00:24:39,160 --> 00:24:41,160
I can't believe I missed another one.

773
00:24:41,160 --> 00:24:42,160
(It'll be a 2,000 dollar fine if they're out on the street.)

774
00:24:42,530 --> 00:24:43,830
(Meanwhile, at the steak restaurant...)

775
00:24:43,830 --> 00:24:45,200
- We can't go now. - Right.

776
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:47,200
- We have to stay. - It's out of our hands now.

777
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:49,240
We'll have to kick out anyone who comes.

778
00:24:49,240 --> 00:24:50,340
I'm truly sorry.

779
00:24:50,340 --> 00:24:51,710
(An unwanted guest appears.)

780
00:24:52,940 --> 00:24:54,440
I had no choice.

781
00:24:54,440 --> 00:24:56,740
Get out.

782
00:24:57,540 --> 00:24:58,650
Why did you come here?

783
00:24:58,650 --> 00:25:00,350
You said you were going to the kimchi restaurant.

784
00:25:00,350 --> 00:25:02,220
- I was going to, but... - It's all good.

785
00:25:02,220 --> 00:25:03,250
Have a seat first.

786
00:25:04,380 --> 00:25:06,290
- I got kicked out. - Sit.

787
00:25:06,290 --> 00:25:09,660
You'll blackout and wake up two minutes later...

788
00:25:09,660 --> 00:25:11,390
on the grass outside.

789
00:25:11,390 --> 00:25:12,390
(You'll wake up on the grass outside.)

790
00:25:13,090 --> 00:25:15,430
That's where you'll wake up.

791
00:25:16,530 --> 00:25:18,970
- On the grass. - Seriously?

792
00:25:19,330 --> 00:25:20,930
There's 3 here and 3 there.

793
00:25:20,930 --> 00:25:23,500
- That means 1,000 dollars. - That's 1,000 dollars for us.

794
00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:26,970
Oh, no. I have nowhere to go though.

795
00:25:26,970 --> 00:25:28,640
(What's important is where Jae Suk, Haha, and Suk Jin goes.)

796
00:25:29,140 --> 00:25:30,810
(Meanwhile, front-runner Kwang Soo is nervous.)

797
00:25:31,780 --> 00:25:33,080
(Okay, it'll soon be over.)

798
00:25:33,080 --> 00:25:34,110
It'll be over soon.

799
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:35,950
There's 20 minutes left.

800
00:25:35,950 --> 00:25:37,020
(Only 20 minutes remain.)

801
00:25:37,020 --> 00:25:38,190
What happens if I win again?

802
00:25:38,650 --> 00:25:40,750
- You'll receive a hint, and - A hint and...

803
00:25:40,750 --> 00:25:42,560
- your meal is free. - What?

804
00:25:42,560 --> 00:25:43,620
(Just then!)

805
00:25:44,390 --> 00:25:45,930
You see...

806
00:25:45,930 --> 00:25:48,430
- There isn't time. - What do you mean?

807
00:25:48,430 --> 00:25:49,830
(What do you mean there isn't time?)

808
00:25:49,830 --> 00:25:51,200
- Get out of here. - There isn't enough time.

809
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:52,470
There's still 20 minutes left.

810
00:25:52,470 --> 00:25:54,370
- There isn't enough time. - What are you going to eat?

811
00:25:54,630 --> 00:25:56,570
What about Haha? Did you come here alone?

812
00:25:56,570 --> 00:25:58,210
Yes. Why isn't anyone here though?

813
00:25:58,210 --> 00:26:00,610
We played a game and Suk Jin got kicked out.

814
00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:02,910
My gosh.

815
00:26:03,040 --> 00:26:06,310
I only came here because the penalty would be cheap.

816
00:26:06,380 --> 00:26:08,080
- My gosh. - The two of us can win.

817
00:26:08,220 --> 00:26:09,550
We can still win this.

818
00:26:09,820 --> 00:26:12,920
- Unbelievable. - I didn't see this coming.

819
00:26:13,190 --> 00:26:14,620
It ends in 10 minutes.

820
00:26:14,620 --> 00:26:17,090
(The chances of winning go up as only 10 minutes remain.)

821
00:26:17,920 --> 00:26:19,290
What are you doing here?

822
00:26:19,290 --> 00:26:21,260
What are you doing back here?

823
00:26:21,260 --> 00:26:24,060
(Suk Jin reappears.)

824
00:26:24,530 --> 00:26:25,800
What are you doing here?

825
00:26:25,800 --> 00:26:26,930
Why are you here?

826
00:26:26,930 --> 00:26:28,540
- Why? - There's nowhere to go.

827
00:26:28,540 --> 00:26:29,640
You could go anywhere.

828
00:26:29,640 --> 00:26:31,070
There isn't enough time.

829
00:26:31,070 --> 00:26:32,840
- Time's almost up. - What have you been doing so far?

830
00:26:32,840 --> 00:26:34,980
Still, why did you come back here?

831
00:26:34,980 --> 00:26:36,180
There's nowhere to go.

832
00:26:36,180 --> 00:26:37,980
We won't win at this rate.

833
00:26:38,750 --> 00:26:41,050
It'll be hilarious if Haha choose steak.

834
00:26:41,050 --> 00:26:42,820
- That'll be great. - Then we'll be in second place.

835
00:26:42,820 --> 00:26:44,750
- 2nd place means... - We'll only pay 30 dollars.

836
00:26:44,750 --> 00:26:47,250
We can easily afford 30 dollars.

837
00:26:47,250 --> 00:26:48,990
That'll be perfect.

838
00:26:48,990 --> 00:26:51,220
Where Haha goes is most important.

839
00:26:53,190 --> 00:26:55,730
He can either come in first place or last place.

840
00:26:56,230 --> 00:26:57,530
It's either or for him.

841
00:26:58,060 --> 00:26:59,400
There's one minute left to the game.

842
00:26:59,430 --> 00:27:01,600
It's over. There's no way he made it.

843
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:04,170
- That'll be 3.8 dollars. - Right.

844
00:27:04,170 --> 00:27:05,210
Here you go.

845
00:27:05,540 --> 00:27:08,070
Please let 1 restaurant have 4 people.

846
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:10,340
Only two minutes remain!

847
00:27:10,340 --> 00:27:12,080
(Everyone's fate is in Haha's hands.)

848
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:14,150
Where was Haha headed?

849
00:27:15,150 --> 00:27:16,720
- He's probably there. - He needs to arrive there.

850
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:17,950
I hope he does.

851
00:27:17,950 --> 00:27:19,390
One Pyeongyang naengmyeon, please.

852
00:27:19,390 --> 00:27:20,550
(One Pyeongyang naengmyeon, please.)

853
00:27:20,550 --> 00:27:21,560
What?

854
00:27:21,720 --> 00:27:23,660
(The fourth customer, Haha enters.)

855
00:27:23,660 --> 00:27:24,760
It was just too hot.

856
00:27:25,390 --> 00:27:26,960
I couldn't walk around anymore.

857
00:27:27,160 --> 00:27:28,830
- What? - Unbelievable!

858
00:27:28,830 --> 00:27:29,960
Didn't anyone leave?

859
00:27:30,130 --> 00:27:31,330
Why didn't you leave?

860
00:27:31,330 --> 00:27:33,470
- Why didn't you go? - Unbelievable.

861
00:27:33,470 --> 00:27:36,370
I thought I'd rather come in last place here.

862
00:27:36,370 --> 00:27:38,370
At least, it'll be cheap.

863
00:27:38,370 --> 00:27:40,170
Why did we play all those games then?

864
00:27:40,170 --> 00:27:41,740
Let's have one person leave now.

865
00:27:41,740 --> 00:27:43,580
- What? - It's for real this time.

866
00:27:44,180 --> 00:27:45,810
Then that person will have to pay 2,000 dollars.

867
00:27:46,210 --> 00:27:48,180
I should've gone to the kimchi place.

868
00:27:48,180 --> 00:27:49,650
- 3, 2... - Unbelievable.

869
00:27:49,650 --> 00:27:50,780
One. Time's up.

870
00:27:50,850 --> 00:27:53,190
This'll cost us 300 dollars.

871
00:27:53,250 --> 00:27:56,460
Four people at the naengmyeon restaurant.

872
00:27:56,960 --> 00:27:58,090
At the braised kimchi restaurant,

873
00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:00,190
there's only 1 person. There's 3 at the steak place.

874
00:28:00,190 --> 00:28:01,230
Yes!

875
00:28:01,230 --> 00:28:02,360
(What?)

876
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:04,200
Are you kidding me?

877
00:28:04,200 --> 00:28:06,370
- What was that? - Are you teasing us?

878
00:28:06,370 --> 00:28:08,640
The people here are terrible with numbers.

879
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:10,840
- Why were you happy just now? - Why?

880
00:28:10,970 --> 00:28:12,540
I should've left this place.

881
00:28:12,540 --> 00:28:15,210
You will pay 10 times the amount which is 300 dollars.

882
00:28:15,210 --> 00:28:17,240
I was going to go to the kimchi restaurant.

883
00:28:17,640 --> 00:28:21,680
You can eat your meal after paying the exact amount.

884
00:28:22,020 --> 00:28:23,650
- We're in second place? - What? There someone else.

885
00:28:23,650 --> 00:28:24,920
Jong Kook...

886
00:28:24,920 --> 00:28:26,350
- See? - We're in second place.

887
00:28:26,350 --> 00:28:28,260
- We're in 2nd place. - 2nd place!

888
00:28:28,260 --> 00:28:29,660
The first mission was...

889
00:28:29,660 --> 00:28:32,630
Lonely Meal and the winner is Song Ji Hyo.

890
00:28:33,390 --> 00:28:34,530
Thank you.

891
00:28:34,530 --> 00:28:35,800
Congratulations.

892
00:28:35,900 --> 00:28:39,600
Who would you like to know about between the father and the stranger?

893
00:28:40,370 --> 00:28:42,340
(Pondering)

894
00:28:42,340 --> 00:28:44,910
I'd like to know about the father.

895
00:28:44,910 --> 00:28:46,840
(She chooses to know about the father.)

896
00:28:47,310 --> 00:28:49,080
Sure. Here you go.

897
00:28:49,380 --> 00:28:51,110
(She will learn two things about the father.)

898
00:28:51,110 --> 00:28:54,250
The first one is about the father's identity.

899
00:28:54,250 --> 00:28:57,280
The second one is about how the father can guess about himself.

900
00:28:57,280 --> 00:28:58,850
(The hints about the father)

901
00:28:59,450 --> 00:29:02,390
The father's blood type isn't AB.

902
00:29:02,760 --> 00:29:03,760
What's this?

903
00:29:03,760 --> 00:29:07,330
(That excludes So Min as the father.)

904
00:29:07,960 --> 00:29:11,030
(The father has to guess who he is exactly.)

905
00:29:11,030 --> 00:29:12,330
(The second hint would help him solve it.)

906
00:29:12,330 --> 00:29:15,240
The second one is about how the father can guess about himself.

907
00:29:15,840 --> 00:29:16,840
What's this?

908
00:29:16,840 --> 00:29:18,640
(Jun Ji Hyun, Song Kang Ho,)

909
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:20,440
(Kang Ha Neul, Gong Yoo know their father,)

910
00:29:20,440 --> 00:29:22,840
(but Shin Min A, Yeo Jin Goo, and Jo In Sung don't.)

911
00:29:22,840 --> 00:29:24,780
"Jun Ji Hyun, Kang Ho Dong..."

912
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:27,250
(Kang Ho Dong?)

913
00:29:27,250 --> 00:29:28,650
"They know their father."

914
00:29:28,650 --> 00:29:30,550
"But Shin Min A, Yeo Jin Goo,"

915
00:29:30,550 --> 00:29:32,290
"and Jo In Sung don't."

916
00:29:32,550 --> 00:29:34,490
(Jun Ji Hyun, Kang Ho Dong, Kang Ha Neul?)

917
00:29:34,960 --> 00:29:35,960
What's this?

918
00:29:36,560 --> 00:29:38,390
(The second clue only matters to the father.)

919
00:29:38,390 --> 00:29:39,960
This is quite tricky.

920
00:29:40,260 --> 00:29:42,200
Anyway, I got it for now.

921
00:29:43,130 --> 00:29:44,630
Thank you.

922
00:29:44,630 --> 00:29:46,430
Gosh, this is good.

923
00:29:46,430 --> 00:29:48,000
- It's delicious. - Gosh.

924
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:53,170
(The expenses so far)

925
00:29:53,370 --> 00:29:55,380
I ate naengmyeon for 300 dollars.

926
00:29:55,380 --> 00:29:56,640
We're already in trouble.

927
00:29:56,640 --> 00:29:57,840
Here comes Ji Hyo.

928
00:29:57,840 --> 00:29:58,850
My gosh.

929
00:29:58,850 --> 00:30:00,050
- The winner. - The winner!

930
00:30:00,050 --> 00:30:01,150
She was the sole winner.

931
00:30:01,150 --> 00:30:03,020
How do you do this?

932
00:30:03,020 --> 00:30:04,750
I'm always fascinated.

933
00:30:05,090 --> 00:30:07,350
Well, I...

934
00:30:07,390 --> 00:30:08,990
Why do you always win games?

935
00:30:08,990 --> 00:30:11,060
- Well... - Share the clues with us.

936
00:30:11,460 --> 00:30:12,490
You received a hint.

937
00:30:12,490 --> 00:30:14,130
- It's unbelievable. - What is it?

938
00:30:14,130 --> 00:30:15,230
(The hint is unbelievable.)

939
00:30:15,230 --> 00:30:17,060
- Really? - The hint...

940
00:30:17,060 --> 00:30:19,930
Actually, I received two.

941
00:30:19,930 --> 00:30:23,370
(She received two hints about the father.)

942
00:30:23,370 --> 00:30:25,110
I'll share one of them.

943
00:30:25,110 --> 00:30:26,110
- Really? - Good.

944
00:30:26,110 --> 00:30:28,110
(The generous winner shares a hint with them.)

945
00:30:28,110 --> 00:30:31,110
The father's blood type isn't AB.

946
00:30:31,110 --> 00:30:33,550
(The father's blood type isn't AB.)

947
00:30:33,550 --> 00:30:35,080
- That excludes So Min. - So it's not So Min.

948
00:30:35,080 --> 00:30:36,250
It's not So Min?

949
00:30:36,450 --> 00:30:39,220
However, she could still be a stranger.

950
00:30:39,220 --> 00:30:42,360
That's right. It could mean she's a stranger.

951
00:30:42,360 --> 00:30:44,620
Must we catch the stranger as well?

952
00:30:44,620 --> 00:30:47,260
The more children the stranger eliminates,

953
00:30:47,260 --> 00:30:49,660
the more money he or she will receive.

954
00:30:49,960 --> 00:30:51,330
Kwang Soo, you're awfully silent.

955
00:30:51,330 --> 00:30:53,330
- I was thinking. - I find it odd...

956
00:30:53,330 --> 00:30:55,600
that you came today with your hair and makeup done.

957
00:30:55,740 --> 00:30:57,540
You were fully dolled up today.

958
00:30:57,540 --> 00:30:59,610
(Did he come early because he's the father or stranger?)

959
00:30:59,610 --> 00:31:02,480
You only saw me because you were there too.

960
00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:05,480
(You only saw me because you were there too.)

961
00:31:05,480 --> 00:31:08,210
I came after the time that was agreed upon.

962
00:31:08,210 --> 00:31:10,880
Wait. The time that was agreed upon?

963
00:31:10,950 --> 00:31:12,720
Was there a meeting?

964
00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:14,090
I meant the time we had to arrive.

965
00:31:14,090 --> 00:31:15,960
- Stop confusing the others. - Hold on.

966
00:31:15,960 --> 00:31:17,560
- It sounds weird. - I'm talking about Kwang Soo.

967
00:31:17,560 --> 00:31:18,830
A time that was agreed upon?

968
00:31:18,860 --> 00:31:21,190
Don't confuse us by saying such things.

969
00:31:21,900 --> 00:31:23,900
- Suk Jin. - I'm just saying.

970
00:31:24,060 --> 00:31:26,270
You should be on point with what you say though.

971
00:31:26,270 --> 00:31:28,000
I get things wrong all the time.

972
00:31:28,070 --> 00:31:29,140
He's right about that.

973
00:31:29,370 --> 00:31:30,800
My gosh!

974
00:31:30,800 --> 00:31:31,810
(The steak trio returns.)

975
00:31:31,810 --> 00:31:33,370
At a steep price...

976
00:31:33,370 --> 00:31:34,970
What a pricey bowl of Pyeongyang naengmyeon.

977
00:31:35,110 --> 00:31:36,740
What happened?

978
00:31:36,740 --> 00:31:38,650
Who knows?

979
00:31:38,650 --> 00:31:39,650
(It's a long story.)

980
00:31:39,650 --> 00:31:41,180
No one actually left.

981
00:31:41,350 --> 00:31:42,520
How...

982
00:31:42,980 --> 00:31:44,850
The naengmyeon team...

983
00:31:45,650 --> 00:31:48,250
(Pyeongyang naengmyeon)

984
00:31:48,250 --> 00:31:50,860
I know it wasn't easy due to the hot weather.

985
00:31:50,890 --> 00:31:55,330
- Right. - Next is Race of Witty Answers.

986
00:31:56,030 --> 00:31:57,930
After you hear the question,

987
00:31:57,930 --> 00:31:59,430
the first one to stand up...

988
00:31:59,430 --> 00:32:00,900
will answer in a two-syllable word.

989
00:32:00,900 --> 00:32:03,100
Then will ask another question in five seconds.

990
00:32:03,100 --> 00:32:05,270
The next person will answer in a three-syllable word then question.

991
00:32:05,270 --> 00:32:08,540
- The next one, four... - The game's been upgraded.

992
00:32:08,540 --> 00:32:10,340
Make sure to answer in more syllables.

993
00:32:10,810 --> 00:32:12,210
1, 2, 3, and so on?

994
00:32:12,210 --> 00:32:15,050
Just so you know, this is my specialty.

995
00:32:15,050 --> 00:32:16,080
You're the worst at this.

996
00:32:16,080 --> 00:32:17,650
It's one of the games I am good at.

997
00:32:17,650 --> 00:32:19,150
Here we go. Get ready.

998
00:32:19,150 --> 00:32:20,190
(The first answer must be in two syllables.)

999
00:32:20,190 --> 00:32:22,460
And go!

1000
00:32:22,460 --> 00:32:24,220
What do you wish to say to the director?

1001
00:32:24,220 --> 00:32:25,230
It's hot.

1002
00:32:25,490 --> 00:32:27,330
What do you wish to say to the director?

1003
00:32:27,360 --> 00:32:29,100
(She means it 100 percent.)

1004
00:32:29,100 --> 00:32:30,430
Who do you wish to see right now?

1005
00:32:30,600 --> 00:32:31,630
My mother!

1006
00:32:31,630 --> 00:32:33,630
(Three syllables)

1007
00:32:33,630 --> 00:32:35,170
Who's the second person you want to see?

1008
00:32:35,170 --> 00:32:36,340
(Who's the second person you want to see?)

1009
00:32:36,340 --> 00:32:37,340
Helen Keller.

1010
00:32:37,340 --> 00:32:38,440
(Four letters)

1011
00:32:40,010 --> 00:32:41,240
That was quite cool.

1012
00:32:41,340 --> 00:32:43,640
(The person he misses?)

1013
00:32:43,940 --> 00:32:45,150
(She's the second person he wants to see.)

1014
00:32:45,150 --> 00:32:46,550
- Helen Keller. - That was cool.

1015
00:32:46,550 --> 00:32:49,020
She's someone we all wish to see.

1016
00:32:49,020 --> 00:32:50,620
- Get on with the game. - Helen Keller.

1017
00:32:50,620 --> 00:32:52,050
The book you were most touched by.

1018
00:32:52,050 --> 00:32:53,490
Your five seconds is up.

1019
00:32:53,890 --> 00:32:55,160
The book you were most touched by.

1020
00:32:55,160 --> 00:32:57,620
(He only had 5 seconds to ask the question.)

1021
00:32:57,620 --> 00:32:59,130
- But... - Five seconds passed.

1022
00:32:59,130 --> 00:33:00,960
All I did was respond to Haha's comment.

1023
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:02,460
- Suk Jin... - Why did you make me talk?

1024
00:33:02,460 --> 00:33:04,560
- Come on. - Why were you admiring...

1025
00:33:04,560 --> 00:33:06,770
your impromptu response? We don't have the time.

1026
00:33:06,900 --> 00:33:08,230
Suk Jin, it's too bad.

1027
00:33:08,230 --> 00:33:09,700
Tell me about it.

1028
00:33:09,700 --> 00:33:11,740
Do you know who Helen Keller is?

1029
00:33:11,740 --> 00:33:13,210
- Jong Kook, please. - Who is she?

1030
00:33:13,240 --> 00:33:14,410
Wasn't she a nurse?

1031
00:33:14,410 --> 00:33:15,540
(Wasn't she a nurse?)

1032
00:33:16,380 --> 00:33:17,440
That's right.

1033
00:33:17,440 --> 00:33:18,550
- Right? - Helen Keller?

1034
00:33:18,550 --> 00:33:20,780
Helen Keller was not a nurse.

1035
00:33:20,780 --> 00:33:22,620
- Nightingale was a nurse. - Nightingale was a nurse.

1036
00:33:22,620 --> 00:33:24,550
(Nightingale was a nurse.)

1037
00:33:24,550 --> 00:33:25,720
I mixed them up.

1038
00:33:25,720 --> 00:33:27,620
(I know, but I mixed them up.)

1039
00:33:27,620 --> 00:33:29,960
Haha said you were right.

1040
00:33:30,160 --> 00:33:31,620
Isn't she something similar?

1041
00:33:32,290 --> 00:33:34,730
She overcame adversity.

1042
00:33:34,860 --> 00:33:36,360
She created something out of nothing.

1043
00:33:36,560 --> 00:33:37,800
She did many good things.

1044
00:33:38,460 --> 00:33:40,070
None of us know exactly.

1045
00:33:40,630 --> 00:33:42,870
Madame Curie is...

1046
00:33:43,570 --> 00:33:44,600
a scientist.

1047
00:33:44,600 --> 00:33:46,110
(But Ji Hyo is the worst at historical figures.)

1048
00:33:46,110 --> 00:33:48,940
(During Race of Witty Answers in episode 460,)

1049
00:33:48,940 --> 00:33:50,910
(she said, "Madame Gurie", instead of "Madame Curie".)

1050
00:33:50,910 --> 00:33:53,250
(That's when Madame Gurie became her nickname.)

1051
00:33:53,250 --> 00:33:55,350
Madame Curie is...

1052
00:33:56,150 --> 00:33:57,180
- a scientist. - Hey,

1053
00:33:57,180 --> 00:33:59,820
I went grocery shopping with my family yesterday,

1054
00:33:59,890 --> 00:34:01,520
and there were oats, which sounds like "guirie".

1055
00:34:01,790 --> 00:34:02,890
Dream suddenly said,

1056
00:34:02,890 --> 00:34:06,090
"Oh, that's Ji Hyo's!"

1057
00:34:06,590 --> 00:34:08,090
(Madame Gurie left a bigger impression than Madame Curie.)

1058
00:34:08,090 --> 00:34:09,330
- It's true. - Madame Gurie is...

1059
00:34:09,400 --> 00:34:10,600
Ji Hyo.

1060
00:34:10,600 --> 00:34:12,800
You're becoming associated with oats.

1061
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:14,300
You might even be offered an oats commercial.

1062
00:34:15,340 --> 00:34:16,440
Here we go.

1063
00:34:16,770 --> 00:34:18,340
Let's start from a two-syllable answer.

1064
00:34:18,770 --> 00:34:20,040
You have to be strict.

1065
00:34:20,370 --> 00:34:22,110
- I'll be strict. - You have to be.

1066
00:34:22,380 --> 00:34:24,240
Because this game exposes our ad-libs skills.

1067
00:34:24,410 --> 00:34:25,580
(Laughing)

1068
00:34:25,650 --> 00:34:27,050
You have an advantage in this game.

1069
00:34:27,050 --> 00:34:28,550
That's why I said it.

1070
00:34:28,550 --> 00:34:31,020
- Jae Suk has an advantage. - All right.

1071
00:34:31,220 --> 00:34:32,690
Seriously.

1072
00:34:32,720 --> 00:34:34,090
- It'll all be exposed. - Let me guarantee you.

1073
00:34:34,090 --> 00:34:35,990
- You'll sit next to Suk Jin. - Be quiet.

1074
00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:38,560
Let me show you how to play this game.

1075
00:34:38,590 --> 00:34:41,030
Ready, start.

1076
00:34:41,030 --> 00:34:42,560
What are you going to do after the shoot?

1077
00:34:42,860 --> 00:34:43,960
Shower.

1078
00:34:43,960 --> 00:34:45,770
(What are you going to do after the shoot?)

1079
00:34:45,770 --> 00:34:47,330
You're both out.

1080
00:34:47,430 --> 00:34:48,470
Shower.

1081
00:34:48,470 --> 00:34:50,540
(Jae Suk is eliminated before he gets to open his mouth.)

1082
00:34:50,540 --> 00:34:52,610
The ad-lib king has fallen.

1083
00:34:52,610 --> 00:34:55,070
- Ji Hyo, I haven't even... - Jae Suk.

1084
00:34:55,070 --> 00:34:57,040
- opened my mouth yet. - Jae Suk.

1085
00:34:57,040 --> 00:34:59,550
You should have said something before getting up this high.

1086
00:34:59,550 --> 00:35:02,350
- Gosh. - You should have said something.

1087
00:35:02,450 --> 00:35:04,450
Gosh, this is frustrating.

1088
00:35:04,750 --> 00:35:07,650
Look. No one left in the game can ad-lib.

1089
00:35:08,320 --> 00:35:09,360
(He is still worried about ad-libs.)

1090
00:35:09,360 --> 00:35:11,120
What are you going to do?

1091
00:35:11,590 --> 00:35:14,130
All the witty members have been eliminated.

1092
00:35:14,130 --> 00:35:17,060
(All the witty members have been eliminated.)

1093
00:35:17,700 --> 00:35:18,870
Who's witty?

1094
00:35:18,870 --> 00:35:19,970
"Witty members"?

1095
00:35:20,100 --> 00:35:22,770
All the good talkers including Madame Gurie are over here.

1096
00:35:23,240 --> 00:35:24,870
Madame Gurie and Helen Keller...

1097
00:35:24,870 --> 00:35:27,710
(With the witty members eliminated, the game continues.)

1098
00:35:27,840 --> 00:35:30,140
(In the next round, Kwang Soo and Jong Kook are eliminated.)

1099
00:35:30,280 --> 00:35:31,340
Here we go.

1100
00:35:32,210 --> 00:35:36,820
What is your secret habit?

1101
00:35:37,520 --> 00:35:38,620
Farting.

1102
00:35:40,490 --> 00:35:41,720
Is farting a habit?

1103
00:35:42,220 --> 00:35:43,320
Ask a question.

1104
00:35:43,320 --> 00:35:46,290
What part of your body has a secret?

1105
00:35:46,360 --> 00:35:47,390
Anus.

1106
00:35:47,390 --> 00:35:49,300
(Anus)

1107
00:35:49,800 --> 00:35:50,930
Anus.

1108
00:35:51,160 --> 00:35:52,770
- Gosh. - Hold on.

1109
00:35:52,770 --> 00:35:54,300
- It's tiny. - What's with you?

1110
00:35:54,700 --> 00:35:56,940
I don't want to play games with him.

1111
00:35:57,170 --> 00:35:58,200
I told you.

1112
00:35:58,200 --> 00:35:59,510
- I'm being honest. - Why would you say that?

1113
00:35:59,510 --> 00:36:00,610
It's gross.

1114
00:36:00,610 --> 00:36:01,670
Make a decision.

1115
00:36:01,670 --> 00:36:04,440
Kids in the lower grades must be cracking up right now.

1116
00:36:04,440 --> 00:36:05,650
They must be going crazy.

1117
00:36:05,650 --> 00:36:08,150
The level of his jokes is too low.

1118
00:36:08,380 --> 00:36:09,780
- Is it accepted? - Se Chan is out.

1119
00:36:09,820 --> 00:36:11,520
- Okay! - His level is too low.

1120
00:36:11,720 --> 00:36:13,020
(So Min and Haha survived by confessing their secrets.)

1121
00:36:13,020 --> 00:36:14,790
Let's start the final round.

1122
00:36:14,850 --> 00:36:17,490
If So Min or Haha wins, that person becomes the winner.

1123
00:36:17,590 --> 00:36:19,660
- Oh, my gosh. - If someone else wins,

1124
00:36:19,660 --> 00:36:21,330
the three of them will play rock-paper-scissors.

1125
00:36:21,730 --> 00:36:22,800
How about this time...

1126
00:36:23,100 --> 00:36:25,770
we sit down after saying the answer?

1127
00:36:25,870 --> 00:36:28,000
I'll ask one question,

1128
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:29,470
- and you'll answer one by one. - All right. That's better.

1129
00:36:29,470 --> 00:36:30,600
- Let's start. - Here we go.

1130
00:36:30,770 --> 00:36:31,900
Start.

1131
00:36:32,810 --> 00:36:36,780
What do you think of before going to sleep?

1132
00:36:37,080 --> 00:36:38,280
You.

1133
00:36:38,280 --> 00:36:40,880
(One syllable)

1134
00:36:40,880 --> 00:36:41,880
Wife.

1135
00:36:42,520 --> 00:36:43,620
Dog.

1136
00:36:44,520 --> 00:36:45,650
My dad.

1137
00:36:46,250 --> 00:36:47,420
Aunt's house.

1138
00:36:48,190 --> 00:36:49,690
(Once again, the ad-lib king...)

1139
00:36:49,690 --> 00:36:50,720
That's only four syllables.

1140
00:36:51,420 --> 00:36:53,030
(He should have given a five-syllable answer.)

1141
00:36:53,030 --> 00:36:54,190
Hold on.

1142
00:36:54,290 --> 00:36:55,930
You're the worst.

1143
00:36:56,060 --> 00:36:57,400
Jae Suk!

1144
00:36:57,460 --> 00:36:59,130
What's wrong with him?

1145
00:36:59,130 --> 00:37:00,130
- Hold on. - What's with you?

1146
00:37:00,130 --> 00:37:02,440
- Are you doing this on purpose? - Hold on.

1147
00:37:02,440 --> 00:37:04,670
Please go out. Go wash your face.

1148
00:37:04,670 --> 00:37:06,410
- Just a second. - Go out!

1149
00:37:06,470 --> 00:37:07,740
- Go... - Aunt's house...

1150
00:37:07,740 --> 00:37:09,010
Go wash your face.

1151
00:37:09,010 --> 00:37:10,280
Go stare into space for a moment.

1152
00:37:10,280 --> 00:37:11,440
When are you going to ad-lib?

1153
00:37:11,440 --> 00:37:13,050
- Go stare into space. - Seriously.

1154
00:37:13,350 --> 00:37:15,950
- How can he be so bad? - This is frustrating.

1155
00:37:16,150 --> 00:37:17,520
I can't do this.

1156
00:37:17,580 --> 00:37:20,420
I'm not really content with staying in the country.

1157
00:37:20,420 --> 00:37:22,820
(The level here is too low for me.)

1158
00:37:22,820 --> 00:37:25,120
- Does Korea have a long way to go? - I can't do this.

1159
00:37:25,160 --> 00:37:26,660
Jae Suk is hilarious.

1160
00:37:27,360 --> 00:37:29,030
- "Aunt's house". - "Aunt's house".

1161
00:37:29,030 --> 00:37:30,230
(Haha mimics the ad-lib king.)

1162
00:37:31,330 --> 00:37:33,270
I can't really compete with you guys.

1163
00:37:33,270 --> 00:37:34,830
Our levels don't match.

1164
00:37:34,930 --> 00:37:36,000
Here we go.

1165
00:37:36,670 --> 00:37:38,300
What's a nickname you want to give your boyfriend or girlfriend?

1166
00:37:38,300 --> 00:37:39,810
(What's a nickname you want to give your boyfriend or girlfriend?)

1167
00:37:39,810 --> 00:37:41,040
- Bear. - Pig.

1168
00:37:41,710 --> 00:37:42,880
Puppy.

1169
00:37:43,810 --> 00:37:45,410
(What nicknames are there?)

1170
00:37:46,250 --> 00:37:47,410
Little punk.

1171
00:37:47,410 --> 00:37:50,420
(Four syllables)

1172
00:37:50,420 --> 00:37:51,550
- That's cute. - Little punk.

1173
00:37:51,550 --> 00:37:52,650
Okay.

1174
00:37:53,220 --> 00:37:54,390
Love Hunter.

1175
00:37:54,420 --> 00:37:55,960
(What's a nickname you want to give your boyfriend or girlfriend?)

1176
00:37:55,960 --> 00:37:57,790
(Only Se Chan and So Min are left.)

1177
00:37:57,790 --> 00:37:58,860
Gas Station of Love.

1178
00:37:58,860 --> 00:38:02,060
(Six syllables)

1179
00:38:02,060 --> 00:38:03,300
"Gas Station of Love"?

1180
00:38:03,430 --> 00:38:04,700
"Gas Station of Love"?

1181
00:38:04,900 --> 00:38:05,970
What do you mean?

1182
00:38:06,070 --> 00:38:07,100
You're out.

1183
00:38:07,100 --> 00:38:09,340
(Se Chan is eliminated.)

1184
00:38:09,870 --> 00:38:11,770
That's funny. "Gas Station of Love".

1185
00:38:12,140 --> 00:38:13,340
Does he fill you up with his love?

1186
00:38:13,340 --> 00:38:14,810
A song with that title might be released.

1187
00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:16,640
A song by Love Hunter,

1188
00:38:16,640 --> 00:38:18,140
- "Gas Station of Love". - "Gas Station of Love".

1189
00:38:18,140 --> 00:38:19,280
("Gas Station of Love" by Love Hunter)

1190
00:38:19,280 --> 00:38:22,450
When your energy level is low, fill yourself with diesel

1191
00:38:22,450 --> 00:38:25,250
(Suk Jin is inspired by the title.)

1192
00:38:25,250 --> 00:38:26,350
(Bang, bang)

1193
00:38:26,450 --> 00:38:28,990
Fill yourself up at the gas station of love

1194
00:38:29,720 --> 00:38:30,960
(Suk Jin is so funny.)

1195
00:38:30,960 --> 00:38:33,730
1.435 dollars per liter

1196
00:38:34,560 --> 00:38:35,800
Here we go. Ready.

1197
00:38:37,060 --> 00:38:38,460
They're finally competing against each other.

1198
00:38:38,460 --> 00:38:39,570
- Finally. - Ready.

1199
00:38:39,600 --> 00:38:40,830
Start.

1200
00:38:40,830 --> 00:38:46,240
What do you want to say to the person on your right?

1201
00:38:46,510 --> 00:38:47,640
- Leave! - Leave!

1202
00:38:47,640 --> 00:38:48,740
(One syllable)

1203
00:38:49,840 --> 00:38:51,610
(Suk Jin and Jong Kook are eliminated.)

1204
00:38:51,610 --> 00:38:52,750
Ji Hyo wins.

1205
00:38:52,910 --> 00:38:54,610
- What is this? - Ji Hyo.

1206
00:38:54,610 --> 00:38:55,650
She didn't even do anything.

1207
00:38:56,950 --> 00:38:58,220
Play rock-paper-scissors.

1208
00:38:58,350 --> 00:39:00,220
If Ji Hyo wins, she'll get another hint.

1209
00:39:00,250 --> 00:39:01,320
Play rock-paper-scissors.

1210
00:39:01,390 --> 00:39:03,290
- Rock-paper-scissors - Rock-paper-scissors

1211
00:39:03,420 --> 00:39:04,860
I was going to play a paper.

1212
00:39:04,920 --> 00:39:06,230
- Rock-paper-scissors - Rock-paper-scissors

1213
00:39:06,560 --> 00:39:09,360
(So Min wins.)

1214
00:39:09,360 --> 00:39:10,830
- Oh, my. - So Min wins.

1215
00:39:11,830 --> 00:39:13,100
So Min is fishy.

1216
00:39:13,100 --> 00:39:14,570
- So Min is fishy. - So Min is fishy.

1217
00:39:14,570 --> 00:39:16,100
- She's been suspicious. - She's been suspicious.

1218
00:39:16,270 --> 00:39:17,740
I'm not the stranger.

1219
00:39:17,740 --> 00:39:19,040
- I swear. - You're suspicious.

1220
00:39:19,040 --> 00:39:21,310
She's been following me around all day.

1221
00:39:21,570 --> 00:39:24,140
And she's trying too hard today.

1222
00:39:24,340 --> 00:39:25,650
I'm not the stranger.

1223
00:39:25,650 --> 00:39:27,210
So Min.

1224
00:39:27,410 --> 00:39:29,650
Would you like a hint about the father...

1225
00:39:29,650 --> 00:39:31,350
or the stranger?

1226
00:39:31,720 --> 00:39:33,190
She usually doesn't win games like this.

1227
00:39:35,150 --> 00:39:36,490
I choose the father.

1228
00:39:37,320 --> 00:39:38,690
I choose the father.

1229
00:39:39,130 --> 00:39:40,530
- The father? - Yes.

1230
00:39:41,790 --> 00:39:44,860
(What's the father hint that So Min received?)

1231
00:39:45,200 --> 00:39:46,500
This is too vague.

1232
00:39:46,500 --> 00:39:49,900
(The father is a man.)

1233
00:39:49,900 --> 00:39:53,340
(All male members become suspects.)

1234
00:39:54,410 --> 00:39:57,340
"The father didn't like rabbits, foxes, and pheasants."

1235
00:39:58,310 --> 00:39:59,680
"Rabbits, foxes, and pheasants".

1236
00:40:00,010 --> 00:40:01,680
"Foxes"? "Rabbits, foxes, and pheasants".

1237
00:40:01,680 --> 00:40:04,750
(The father didn't like rabbits, foxes, and pheasants.)

1238
00:40:04,920 --> 00:40:06,150
So Min, is it something you can't share with us?

1239
00:40:06,350 --> 00:40:08,820
I've helped her out today. I'm sure she'll share it with me.

1240
00:40:08,920 --> 00:40:10,290
I can share it with Ji Hyo.

1241
00:40:10,590 --> 00:40:12,390
- Ji Hyo has a hint too. - I'll share it with Ji Hyo.

1242
00:40:13,030 --> 00:40:15,260
Let's move to our next mission spot.

1243
00:40:15,260 --> 00:40:17,930
- Yes, let's go! - We have no hints.

1244
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:20,600
- Let's start. - Okay.

1245
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:23,100
This is the final mission where you can get hints...

1246
00:40:23,100 --> 00:40:24,970
about the father and the stranger.

1247
00:40:24,970 --> 00:40:26,910
It's called Quiz King, Shoot and Goal.

1248
00:40:27,010 --> 00:40:28,070
"Quiz"?

1249
00:40:28,140 --> 00:40:30,610
After hearing the choices and answer for each question,

1250
00:40:30,710 --> 00:40:32,910
guess what...

1251
00:40:32,910 --> 00:40:34,480
the question is.

1252
00:40:34,650 --> 00:40:35,950
We have to guess what the question is?

1253
00:40:36,350 --> 00:40:37,620
- This is new. - That's...

1254
00:40:37,620 --> 00:40:38,850
(They have to guess what the question is.)

1255
00:40:38,850 --> 00:40:39,890
We've never done this before.

1256
00:40:39,890 --> 00:40:42,290
The member with the highest score...

1257
00:40:42,290 --> 00:40:45,630
can choose between hints about the father and the stranger.

1258
00:40:45,630 --> 00:40:46,690
I have one.

1259
00:40:46,760 --> 00:40:48,230
Here's the question.

1260
00:40:48,230 --> 00:40:49,960
Guess the question...

1261
00:40:49,960 --> 00:40:51,800
after hearing the following choices with the correct answer.

1262
00:40:51,800 --> 00:40:53,400
Number one, Lee Kwang Soo.

1263
00:40:53,730 --> 00:40:55,100
Number two, Lee Min Ho.

1264
00:40:55,330 --> 00:40:56,800
Number three, Kim Soo Hyun.

1265
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:59,010
- Number four, Yoo Jae Suk. - Really?

1266
00:40:59,010 --> 00:41:01,470
The answer is number one, Lee Kwang Soo.

1267
00:41:02,110 --> 00:41:04,610
The answer is number one, Lee Kwang Soo.

1268
00:41:04,610 --> 00:41:05,650
Let me answer.

1269
00:41:06,010 --> 00:41:07,180
Which of the following...

1270
00:41:07,710 --> 00:41:09,250
is the stupidest?

1271
00:41:09,250 --> 00:41:11,520
(Which of the following looks the stupidest?)

1272
00:41:11,520 --> 00:41:12,650
There was Jae Suk too.

1273
00:41:12,750 --> 00:41:14,390
Jae Suk doesn't look stupid.

1274
00:41:14,390 --> 00:41:15,420
Wrong.

1275
00:41:15,920 --> 00:41:16,960
Let me answer.

1276
00:41:17,790 --> 00:41:18,890
Which of the following...

1277
00:41:19,530 --> 00:41:21,560
makes money by betraying others?

1278
00:41:21,560 --> 00:41:22,930
Why do you keep talking about money?

1279
00:41:23,400 --> 00:41:24,760
You've been talking about money all day.

1280
00:41:24,900 --> 00:41:26,870
- Let me answer. - This is driving me crazy.

1281
00:41:26,930 --> 00:41:27,930
Which of the following...

1282
00:41:28,300 --> 00:41:29,870
is scared of spending 50 cents?

1283
00:41:30,100 --> 00:41:31,870
When was I scared of spending 50 cents?

1284
00:41:31,970 --> 00:41:33,010
Lee Kwang Soo.

1285
00:41:33,340 --> 00:41:34,470
Correct.

1286
00:41:34,640 --> 00:41:36,510
The answer is Lee Kwang Soo. But I've never...

1287
00:41:36,710 --> 00:41:37,940
Let me give you a hint.

1288
00:41:37,940 --> 00:41:39,910
The question includes...

1289
00:41:40,210 --> 00:41:42,010
- the word, "success". - "Success"?

1290
00:41:42,010 --> 00:41:43,080
Let me answer.

1291
00:41:43,420 --> 00:41:45,420
Which of the following became successful by saving every penny?

1292
00:41:45,690 --> 00:41:46,820
What?

1293
00:41:46,820 --> 00:41:48,620
(The symbol of thrift)

1294
00:41:48,620 --> 00:41:50,090
(Hitting)

1295
00:41:50,090 --> 00:41:52,760
What? What's wrong?

1296
00:41:53,160 --> 00:41:54,260
That's right.

1297
00:41:54,360 --> 00:41:55,730
It's a good thing.

1298
00:41:55,730 --> 00:41:56,900
I spend quite a lot of money.

1299
00:41:56,900 --> 00:41:57,960
I know saving is a good thing,

1300
00:41:57,960 --> 00:41:59,300
but I spend a lot of money.

1301
00:42:00,100 --> 00:42:02,370
(A strong denial is an affirmation.)

1302
00:42:02,370 --> 00:42:03,440
Does it include "success"?

1303
00:42:04,140 --> 00:42:05,200
Let me answer.

1304
00:42:05,340 --> 00:42:07,440
Which celebrity do fans abroad think...

1305
00:42:07,510 --> 00:42:10,710
will become the most successful abroad?

1306
00:42:12,650 --> 00:42:13,680
All right.

1307
00:42:13,680 --> 00:42:15,080
- Was it even close? - It was 98 percent correct.

1308
00:42:15,180 --> 00:42:16,250
Maybe it's not "abroad".

1309
00:42:17,450 --> 00:42:19,120
Let me answer. Which celebrity do foreigners think...

1310
00:42:19,250 --> 00:42:21,190
will become successful in their country?

1311
00:42:21,190 --> 00:42:24,290
(Which celebrity do foreigners think...)

1312
00:42:24,290 --> 00:42:27,390
(will become successful in their country?)

1313
00:42:27,390 --> 00:42:28,490
Okay!

1314
00:42:29,060 --> 00:42:30,900
(Which celebrity will become successful in your country?)

1315
00:42:30,900 --> 00:42:32,800
(Kwang Soo in 1st place, Jae Suk in 2nd place)

1316
00:42:32,800 --> 00:42:35,000
Why is Kwang Soo at the top?

1317
00:42:35,100 --> 00:42:36,840
All right. Here's the next question.

1318
00:42:37,040 --> 00:42:39,610
Guess the question from the following choices and answer.

1319
00:42:39,770 --> 00:42:41,540
Number 1: Age 40.

1320
00:42:41,540 --> 00:42:43,280
Number 2: Age 60.

1321
00:42:43,280 --> 00:42:45,040
Number 3: Age 25.

1322
00:42:45,040 --> 00:42:46,710
Number 4: Age 35.

1323
00:42:46,810 --> 00:42:48,780
The answer is number 1, age 40.

1324
00:42:48,780 --> 00:42:49,880
"Age 40"?

1325
00:42:50,350 --> 00:42:51,520
Let me answer.!

1326
00:42:51,520 --> 00:42:54,090
Which age do you want to go back to?

1327
00:42:54,520 --> 00:42:55,720
The question is not about you.

1328
00:42:55,720 --> 00:42:57,320
(Suk Jin is 54.)

1329
00:42:57,590 --> 00:42:58,660
What?

1330
00:42:58,660 --> 00:42:59,930
Suk Jin.

1331
00:43:00,360 --> 00:43:02,290
- The survey... - Who would want to go back to 40?

1332
00:43:02,290 --> 00:43:04,430
The survey might have been among 60-year-olds.

1333
00:43:04,430 --> 00:43:05,930
Let me answer.

1334
00:43:06,730 --> 00:43:08,630
Which is the best age to get married?

1335
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:10,240
(Wrong)

1336
00:43:10,240 --> 00:43:12,170
No. 40 is wrong. I did consider that though.

1337
00:43:12,170 --> 00:43:13,210
Here's a hint.

1338
00:43:13,610 --> 00:43:16,440
From which age can you "Blank"?

1339
00:43:16,440 --> 00:43:18,140
(From which age can you "Blank"?)

1340
00:43:18,140 --> 00:43:20,150
Let me answer!

1341
00:43:21,010 --> 00:43:23,020
From which age can you run for president?

1342
00:43:23,020 --> 00:43:26,490
(From which age can you run for president?)

1343
00:43:26,490 --> 00:43:28,350
From which age can you run for president?

1344
00:43:29,120 --> 00:43:30,160
- Really? - Really?

1345
00:43:31,060 --> 00:43:32,120
- Really? - Really?

1346
00:43:32,120 --> 00:43:33,660
Can you run for president from the age of 40?

1347
00:43:33,960 --> 00:43:35,330
You can run for president from the age of 40.

1348
00:43:35,330 --> 00:43:36,760
- Did you know that? - Yes.

1349
00:43:37,060 --> 00:43:39,770
Hold on. I guess you planned to run for president.

1350
00:43:40,730 --> 00:43:42,700
(Candidate 0 from Running Party, Yoo Jae Suk)

1351
00:43:42,700 --> 00:43:44,740
- Hold on. - He must have looked into it.

1352
00:43:44,740 --> 00:43:46,670
- I support him! - That must be why he knows.

1353
00:43:46,670 --> 00:43:48,910
You should do it. I will support you.

1354
00:43:48,910 --> 00:43:50,810
Make me the Minister of Sports.

1355
00:43:50,810 --> 00:43:53,950
(Make me the Minister of Sports.)

1356
00:43:54,650 --> 00:43:56,780
I can do a good job.

1357
00:43:56,920 --> 00:43:58,080
I am sure he will do a good job.

1358
00:43:58,820 --> 00:44:00,190
He is perfect for the position.

1359
00:44:00,190 --> 00:44:02,960
The Minister of Sports!

1360
00:44:02,960 --> 00:44:04,190
All right. Here comes the next question.

1361
00:44:04,190 --> 00:44:05,990
Guess the question...

1362
00:44:05,990 --> 00:44:07,790

1363
00:44:08,060 --> 00:44:09,600

00:44:12,430 --> 00:44:13,930
Number four, Jennie.

1367
00:44:14,030 --> 00:44:16,340
The answer is number four, Jennie.

1368
00:44:16,340 --> 00:44:18,070
Jennie? Not So Min?

1369
00:44:18,070 --> 00:44:19,170
(Surprised)

1370
00:44:19,170 --> 00:44:20,710
I am not even the answer!

1371
00:44:21,010 --> 00:44:23,480
- What is this? - So Min is one of the choices.

1372
00:44:24,210 --> 00:44:25,880
I am so confused since So Min is one of the choices.

1373
00:44:25,880 --> 00:44:27,380
- Jennie? - Let me answer.

1374
00:44:27,550 --> 00:44:31,550
Among the following, who do men want as a girlfriend?

1375
00:44:32,550 --> 00:44:34,350
(Could that be the question?)

1376
00:44:34,350 --> 00:44:35,720
(Among the following, who do men want as a girlfriend?)

1377
00:44:35,720 --> 00:44:36,960
- You are close. - What?

1378
00:44:37,060 --> 00:44:38,160
Let me answer!

1379
00:44:38,160 --> 00:44:39,330
(Let me answer!)

1380
00:44:39,330 --> 00:44:42,260
Who do men want to be asked out by on Valentine's Day?

1381
00:44:42,260 --> 00:44:47,030
(Who do men want to be asked out by on Valentine's Day?)

1382
00:44:47,370 --> 00:44:48,900
Valentine's Day?

1383
00:44:49,700 --> 00:44:52,170
(Number 1, Jennie)

1384
00:44:52,170 --> 00:44:53,440
I got it right!

1385
00:44:53,440 --> 00:44:54,840
- I see. - I got it right!

1386
00:44:54,840 --> 00:44:56,510
Why is So Min doing so well today?

1387
00:44:56,510 --> 00:44:58,780
- What is up with you? - Why are you playing so diligently?

1388
00:44:58,780 --> 00:45:01,310
- I mean... - She used to focus on being funny.

1389
00:45:01,310 --> 00:45:03,080
So Min is acting strange today.

1390
00:45:03,180 --> 00:45:04,480
You took on a role, didn't you?

1391
00:45:04,480 --> 00:45:06,290
- I really didn't. - So Min must have taken on a role.

1392
00:45:06,290 --> 00:45:07,490
I really didn't.

1393
00:45:07,490 --> 00:45:09,260
I am just lucky for some reason today.

1394
00:45:09,790 --> 00:45:11,060
Here comes the next question.

1395
00:45:11,390 --> 00:45:12,960
Guess the question...

1396
00:45:12,960 --> 00:45:14,490
after hearing the following choices with the correct answer.

1397
00:45:14,490 --> 00:45:16,760

The answer is number one, Game console and audio equipment.

1402
00:45:27,010 --> 00:45:28,240
Let me answer.

1403
00:45:28,640 --> 00:45:32,780
What is needed the most in case of a war?

1404
00:45:32,780 --> 00:45:34,750
(What is needed the most in case of a war?)

1405
00:45:34,750 --> 00:45:36,420
And you think the answer is game console and audio equipment?

1406
00:45:36,420 --> 00:45:38,480
Gosh, do you even think before you open your mouth?

1407
00:45:38,480 --> 00:45:40,850
He has been strange since "Anus".

1408
00:45:41,450 --> 00:45:43,160
(Haha's answer is incorrect.)

1409
00:45:43,390 --> 00:45:45,190
Let me answer. What is needed the most for a trip?

1410
00:45:45,190 --> 00:45:47,060
(What is needed the most for a trip?)

1411
00:45:47,060 --> 00:45:48,830
(Could that be the answer?)

1412
00:45:48,830 --> 00:45:50,530
(What is needed the most for a trip?)

1413
00:45:50,630 --> 00:45:51,960
Jong Kook's answer was about 90 percent correct.

1414
00:45:51,960 --> 00:45:53,100
Let me answer!

1415
00:45:53,100 --> 00:45:54,170
(Let me answer!)

1416
00:45:54,170 --> 00:45:57,400
Let me answer. What is needed the most when you travel alone?

1417
00:45:58,200 --> 00:46:02,210
(If So Min's answer is correct, she will win with 2 points.)

1418
00:46:02,210 --> 00:46:03,840
What is needed the most when you travel alone?

1419
00:46:03,840 --> 00:46:05,710
My goodness.

1420
00:46:05,950 --> 00:46:07,880
- My goodness. - What is up with her?

1421
00:46:08,350 --> 00:46:09,950
What is going on?

1422
00:46:10,220 --> 00:46:12,120
She isn't usually like that.

1423
00:46:12,180 --> 00:46:14,290
- You... - I am not the stranger!

1424
00:46:14,290 --> 00:46:16,960
- I am not the stranger! - Hold on.

1425
00:46:16,960 --> 00:46:18,660
What are you doing?

1426
00:46:19,120 --> 00:46:20,690
- Hey. - Hey, Stranger.

1427
00:46:20,690 --> 00:46:22,800
Does the game end if we rip off the stranger's name tag?

1428
00:46:22,800 --> 00:46:24,130
We will rip it off.

1429
00:46:24,130 --> 00:46:25,630
Does the game end if we rip off the stranger's name tag?

1430
00:46:25,630 --> 00:46:27,200
- She is the stranger. - I am not!

1431
00:46:27,600 --> 00:46:29,770
I am not the stranger!

1432
00:46:29,770 --> 00:46:32,000
What do we do after we find the stranger?

1433
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:33,270
I am not...

1434
00:46:33,640 --> 00:46:36,040
Are you the father or stranger?

1435
00:46:36,040 --> 00:46:38,140
I am 100 percent sure So Min isn't the father.

1436
00:46:38,140 --> 00:46:40,750
That's why she is desperate.

1437
00:46:41,150 --> 00:46:42,550
- This is driving me crazy. - She is the stranger.

1438
00:46:43,380 --> 00:46:45,150
- I am not... - She is determined...

1439
00:46:45,150 --> 00:46:46,850
to win.

1440
00:46:48,490 --> 00:46:51,120
So Min will receive a hint.

1441
00:46:51,490 --> 00:46:53,230
She will receive a hint.

1442
00:46:53,230 --> 00:46:54,590
(She can receive a hint on either the father or stranger.)

1443
00:46:54,590 --> 00:46:56,930
We need hints.

1444
00:46:57,560 --> 00:46:59,000
Whose hint do you want?

1445
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:01,770
The father or stranger?

1446
00:47:01,830 --> 00:47:03,370
- The father. - The father.

1447
00:47:03,370 --> 00:47:04,740
It will make the matter clearer.

1448
00:47:05,040 --> 00:47:06,070
What should I do?

1449
00:47:07,010 --> 00:47:09,960
(What kind of a hint on the father will So Min receive?)

1450
00:47:14,440 --> 00:47:17,300
(The father uses his or her real name.)

1451
00:47:17,600 --> 00:47:18,860
(Combining the hint she received on the father...)

1452
00:47:18,860 --> 00:47:20,170
This is too vague.

1453
00:47:20,170 --> 00:47:21,530
(after the second mission...)

1454
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:23,540
(The father candidates are 6 male members.)

1455
00:47:23,540 --> 00:47:25,070
(If you cross out Haha since he uses a stage name,)

1456
00:47:25,070 --> 00:47:27,740
(there are five father candidates.)

1457
00:47:28,170 --> 00:47:29,170
(The father would want to know the hint on his identity.)

1458
00:47:29,170 --> 00:47:31,110
"The father didn't like to move around."

1459
00:47:31,110 --> 00:47:32,240
(The father didn't like to move around.)

1460
00:47:32,610 --> 00:47:33,950
(Hint 3: The father didn't like to move around.)

1461
00:47:33,980 --> 00:47:35,680
(Hint 2: The father didn't like rabbits, foxes, and pheasants.)

1462
00:47:35,680 --> 00:47:37,050
(Hint 1: Ji Hyun, Kang Ho, Ha Neul, Gong Yoo know their father,)

1463
00:47:37,050 --> 00:47:38,350
(but Shin Min A, Yeo Jin Goo, and Jo In Sung don't.)

1464
00:47:38,350 --> 00:47:41,850
Let's move for the last race.

1465
00:47:41,850 --> 00:47:43,720
The hint doesn't make the matter any clearer, right?

1466
00:47:43,790 --> 00:47:45,260
It's really confusing.

1467
00:47:46,760 --> 00:47:48,890
- Is everyone here? - Yes.

1468
00:47:48,960 --> 00:47:50,200
Don't be nervous with your cover blown.

1469
00:47:50,200 --> 00:47:52,660
- Work hard. - I am not the stranger.

1470
00:47:52,660 --> 00:47:54,030
So Min, don't be nervous.

1471
00:47:54,030 --> 00:47:55,700
This is driving me crazy. I am not the stranger.

1472
00:47:55,700 --> 00:47:56,970
So Min.

1473
00:47:57,100 --> 00:47:58,240
I am not the stranger.

1474
00:47:58,240 --> 00:48:00,440
What are you doing?

1475
00:48:00,840 --> 00:48:01,840
Tell me when the race starts.

1476
00:48:01,840 --> 00:48:02,940
He is ready to get her.

1477
00:48:02,940 --> 00:48:04,810
All right. I will give you the rules.

1478
00:48:04,810 --> 00:48:07,810
The last mission that will reveal the father and stranger is...

1479
00:48:07,810 --> 00:48:09,680
Your Identity Race.

1480
00:48:10,480 --> 00:48:13,620
Walkie-talkies with hints on the father and stranger...

1481
00:48:13,620 --> 00:48:15,520
- are hidden in the building. - Okay.

1482
00:48:15,690 --> 00:48:18,260
You will get a hint of your choice on either...

1483
00:48:18,260 --> 00:48:19,860
the father or the stranger through the walkie-talkie.

1484
00:48:19,860 --> 00:48:20,860
I see.

1485
00:48:20,860 --> 00:48:23,260
If the father gets eliminated by the children,

1486
00:48:23,260 --> 00:48:24,460
the children will win...

1487
00:48:24,460 --> 00:48:27,200
and will divide the 6,000 dollars among themselves.

1488
00:48:27,630 --> 00:48:29,300
If the father gets eliminated by the stranger,

1489
00:48:29,300 --> 00:48:30,600
the stranger wins...

1490
00:48:30,600 --> 00:48:34,510
and gets 1,000 dollars for each child he or she eliminated.

1491
00:48:34,810 --> 00:48:37,710
The stranger needs to eliminate as many children as possible...

1492
00:48:37,710 --> 00:48:39,950
before eliminating the father to get a lot of money.

1493
00:48:40,780 --> 00:48:42,780
The stranger must eliminate the father...

1494
00:48:42,780 --> 00:48:44,650
to receive the money.

1495
00:48:44,650 --> 00:48:46,120
We should watch out for the stranger.

1496
00:48:46,120 --> 00:48:47,790
(We should watch out for the stranger.)

1497
00:48:48,320 --> 00:48:50,990
If both the stranger and father get eliminated...

1498
00:48:50,990 --> 00:48:52,690
- Kwang Soo, just let her be. - I am sorry.

1499
00:48:52,690 --> 00:48:54,430
- Why do you keep doing that? - I am sorry.

1500
00:48:54,430 --> 00:48:57,460
If both the stranger and father get eliminated by the same child,

1501
00:48:57,460 --> 00:49:01,130
that child becomes the sole winner and wins 6,000 dollars.

1502
00:49:01,130 --> 00:49:02,600
- It won't be easy. - I should aim to do that.

1503
00:49:02,630 --> 00:49:05,800
The father needs to find the right platform...

1504
00:49:06,110 --> 00:49:08,670
among the three platforms and enter his information...

1505
00:49:08,670 --> 00:49:10,680
in order to win.

1506
00:49:10,780 --> 00:49:12,480
If he becomes the winner, he receives 6,000 dollars.

1507
00:49:12,810 --> 00:49:15,280
The stranger and children need to rip off the father's name tag...

1508
00:49:15,280 --> 00:49:18,450
and put it on the right platform in order to win.

1509
00:49:18,450 --> 00:49:19,690
We need to find out who the father is.

1510
00:49:19,850 --> 00:49:22,050
If a child rips off another child's name tag,

1511
00:49:22,050 --> 00:49:23,190
both of them get eliminated.

1512
00:49:23,320 --> 00:49:25,790
If the father rips off the stranger's name tag,

1513
00:49:25,790 --> 00:49:28,960
he or she will receive a hint on his identity.

1514
00:49:29,700 --> 00:49:32,100
So it would be good for the father to rip off the stranger's name tag.

1515
00:49:32,330 --> 00:49:35,070
Go to your positions and we will start the race.

1516
00:49:35,070 --> 00:49:36,840
- Let's go. - I don't know how to approach this.

1517
00:49:36,840 --> 00:49:37,940
Where are you going to be?

1518
00:49:37,940 --> 00:49:39,370
- It's unclear. - For goodness' sake.

1519
00:49:39,370 --> 00:49:40,770
So Min, I will call you right away.

1520
00:49:42,370 --> 00:49:44,910
Why is So Min always suspicious?

1521
00:49:45,180 --> 00:49:47,210
This has to be a disease. It drives me crazy.

1522
00:49:47,210 --> 00:49:48,680
She is so suspicious.

1523
00:49:48,980 --> 00:49:51,020
Either So Min or Kwang Soo...

1524
00:49:51,020 --> 00:49:52,520
is the stranger.

1525
00:49:53,290 --> 00:49:55,390
Either Se Chan or So Min is the stranger.

1526
00:49:55,390 --> 00:49:56,420
(Kwang Soo's guess)

1527
00:49:56,420 --> 00:49:57,690
I have no clue who the father is.

1528
00:49:59,730 --> 00:50:02,290
Se Chan is suspicious. He played Woong's Father.

1529
00:50:03,400 --> 00:50:05,560
The father could be Haha,

1530
00:50:06,230 --> 00:50:08,430
Jae Suk, or Suk Jin.

1531
00:50:08,700 --> 00:50:11,340
I bet they picked someone young for the father.

1532
00:50:11,340 --> 00:50:12,340
(I bet they picked someone young for the father.)

1533
00:50:12,340 --> 00:50:13,370
Five.

1534
00:50:13,670 --> 00:50:14,670
Four.

1535
00:50:14,910 --> 00:50:15,970
Three.

1536
00:50:16,140 --> 00:50:17,140
Two.

1537
00:50:17,580 --> 00:50:18,610
One.

1538
00:50:18,740 --> 00:50:19,850
Start.

1539
00:50:20,410 --> 00:50:22,080
The race starts.

1540
00:50:22,180 --> 00:50:23,450
I will go here.

1541
00:50:23,850 --> 00:50:25,250
- Kwang Soo. - Hey.

1542
00:50:25,950 --> 00:50:27,550
Why are there two cameras on you?

1543
00:50:29,760 --> 00:50:31,020
I don't know.

1544
00:50:31,190 --> 00:50:32,860
- How am I supposed to know? - You make it so obvious.

1545
00:50:33,130 --> 00:50:34,460
How am I supposed to know?

1546
00:50:34,490 --> 00:50:37,130
Why are there two cameras on you?

1547
00:50:37,830 --> 00:50:39,830
- There must be something... - It's not a crime.

1548
00:50:40,130 --> 00:50:42,270
There is a rotating camera on you.

1549
00:50:42,270 --> 00:50:44,270
This hasn't happened in nine years.

1550
00:50:44,270 --> 00:50:45,400
(The rotating camera)

1551
00:50:45,400 --> 00:50:46,440
Okay.

1552
00:50:46,440 --> 00:50:48,540
Know that you are a stranger candidate.

1553
00:50:48,640 --> 00:50:50,180
It makes no sense that you have two cameras on you.

1554
00:50:50,510 --> 00:50:51,580
Don't you agree?

1555
00:50:52,140 --> 00:50:55,310
The walkie-talkies must be inside a box.

1556
00:50:56,080 --> 00:50:57,980
(Where are the walkie-talkies?)

1557
00:50:57,980 --> 00:51:00,050
(What?)

1558
00:51:00,050 --> 00:51:02,620
You should keep the door closed when the air conditioner is on.

1559
00:51:02,620 --> 00:51:03,690
(He saves energy.)

1560
00:51:03,690 --> 00:51:06,490
For goodness' sake. The air conditioner is on.

1561
00:51:06,590 --> 00:51:07,930
The air conditioner is on.

1562
00:51:08,030 --> 00:51:09,630
(Jong Kook is the best when it comes to saving energy.)

1563
00:51:09,630 --> 00:51:11,060
Why would you leave the door open?

1564
00:51:12,400 --> 00:51:14,400
This place is too big.

1565
00:51:14,800 --> 00:51:16,440
(Where are the walkie-talkies?)

1566
00:51:17,100 --> 00:51:18,500
(My goodness!)

1567
00:51:19,370 --> 00:51:20,940
(Hidden between the displays...)

1568
00:51:20,940 --> 00:51:23,340
(was a walkie-talkie box.)

1569
00:51:23,340 --> 00:51:24,480
No way.

1570
00:51:24,610 --> 00:51:25,840
I was only taking a peek.

1571
00:51:25,840 --> 00:51:26,950
(He is off to a good start.)

1572
00:51:27,380 --> 00:51:32,250
(He can receive a hint on the father or stranger.)

1573
00:51:33,490 --> 00:51:35,490
Should I receive a hint on the father or stranger?

1574
00:51:35,490 --> 00:51:37,860
(Whose hint should I receive?)

1575
00:51:37,920 --> 00:51:39,490
Give me a hint on the father.

1576
00:51:39,520 --> 00:51:43,260
The father has starred in a movie.

1577
00:51:43,260 --> 00:51:46,830
- What? - The father has starred in a movie.

1578
00:51:47,170 --> 00:51:48,670
That eliminates Yang Se Chan.

1579
00:51:48,670 --> 00:51:49,900
(The remaining father candidates...)

1580
00:51:49,900 --> 00:51:51,370
(are Jae Suk, Jong Kook, Suk Jin, and Kwang Soo.)

1581
00:51:51,740 --> 00:51:55,010
I will give you a hint on the father's identity.

1582
00:51:55,010 --> 00:51:56,440
The father's friends are...

1583
00:51:56,440 --> 00:51:59,750
Lee Sang Hwa, Lee Dong Hwi, and Lee Si Young.

1584
00:52:01,280 --> 00:52:04,650
(Why are these people father's friends?)

1585
00:52:06,350 --> 00:52:08,290
(Hint 4: The father's friends are Sang Hwa, Dong Hwi, and Si Young.)

1586
00:52:08,290 --> 00:52:10,360
This is so hard.

1587
00:52:10,360 --> 00:52:11,520
(Hint 4: The father's friends are Sang Hwa, Dong Hwi, and Si Young.)

1588
00:52:11,520 --> 00:52:13,560
Haha, please give me a hint.

1589
00:52:13,560 --> 00:52:16,400
I will give you a big hint.

1590
00:52:16,400 --> 00:52:19,430
Write it down. I am giving you too big of a hint.

1591
00:52:20,030 --> 00:52:22,430
(What could it be?)

1592
00:52:22,870 --> 00:52:24,000
Lee Sang Hwa.

1593
00:52:24,040 --> 00:52:25,770
Lee Sang Hwa. The skater?

1594
00:52:26,640 --> 00:52:27,840
I don't know.

1595
00:52:27,840 --> 00:52:29,940
- Lee Sang Hwa? - Lee Dong Hwi.

1596
00:52:30,540 --> 00:52:31,680
Lee Sang Hwa.

1597
00:52:32,010 --> 00:52:33,010
Lee Si Young.

1598
00:52:33,010 --> 00:52:34,850
- What? - Lee Si Young.

1599
00:52:35,280 --> 00:52:37,520
(They are lost.)

1600
00:52:37,520 --> 00:52:38,650
What do these names mean?

1601
00:52:38,650 --> 00:52:39,720
- Are these names related to him? - Is that it?

1602
00:52:39,720 --> 00:52:40,750
The father's friends are...

1603
00:52:40,750 --> 00:52:42,620
Lee Sang Hwa, Lee Dong Hwi, and Lee Si Young.

1604
00:52:42,620 --> 00:52:43,620
The father's friends?

1605
00:52:43,620 --> 00:52:46,460
Hey, Kwang Soo and Dong Hwi...

1606
00:52:46,830 --> 00:52:48,030
are friends.

1607
00:52:48,030 --> 00:52:51,230
Si Young was in his team when she visited the show.

1608
00:52:51,530 --> 00:52:54,430
I think the father is Kwang Soo.

1609
00:52:54,870 --> 00:52:56,440
- How about the stranger? - Isn't the stranger...

1610
00:52:56,440 --> 00:52:57,800
So Min?

1611
00:52:58,040 --> 00:53:00,410
- The 2 of them placed 1st. - Is that your hunch?

1612
00:53:00,410 --> 00:53:02,170
- You don't even have a hint. - I know I don't, but...

1613
00:53:02,170 --> 00:53:03,510
I won't write it down.

1614
00:53:03,510 --> 00:53:04,740
(I won't write it down.)

1615
00:53:05,540 --> 00:53:08,810
A hunch doesn't mean much.

1616
00:53:08,810 --> 00:53:10,720
- Se Chan, you... - A hunch doesn't mean much.

1617
00:53:10,720 --> 00:53:13,120
When you watch this on TV, you will say after 30 minutes,

1618
00:53:13,120 --> 00:53:15,020
"Gosh, Suk Jin is so sharp."

1619
00:53:15,420 --> 00:53:17,590
I get that you are sharp, but I won't write it down.

1620
00:53:17,590 --> 00:53:19,020
- This is driving me crazy. - I will only write down the hint.

1621
00:53:19,020 --> 00:53:20,860
- Don't spread the hint. - I won't.

1622
00:53:20,860 --> 00:53:22,590
Okay. Let's keep this to ourselves.

1623
00:53:24,860 --> 00:53:26,670
Are there no walkie-talkies? There should be one here.

1624
00:53:27,030 --> 00:53:28,330
There should be one here.

1625
00:53:28,330 --> 00:53:29,330
(She searches the lecture hall.)

1626
00:53:30,600 --> 00:53:32,140
(She keeps her eyes open wide.)

1627
00:53:33,470 --> 00:53:36,270
(On top of the piano is...)

1628
00:53:36,270 --> 00:53:39,110
(a walkie-talkie box.)

1629
00:53:39,110 --> 00:53:41,510
I am torn. Whose hint should I ask for?

1630
00:53:41,810 --> 00:53:45,050
Let's figure out who the father is. That would be better.

1631
00:53:45,650 --> 00:53:47,320
Should I ask for a hint on the stranger?

1632
00:53:47,850 --> 00:53:50,160
No. I would like to hear a hint on the father.

1633
00:53:50,920 --> 00:53:55,030
The father has number four in his age.

1634
00:53:55,030 --> 00:53:56,600
(The hint eliminates Ji Hyo, Kwang Soo, Se Chan, and So Min.)

1635
00:53:56,600 --> 00:53:57,600
The father...

1636
00:53:57,600 --> 00:54:01,400
(The father candidates are Jae Suk, Jong Kook, and Suk Jin.)

1637
00:54:02,070 --> 00:54:04,040
This is a hint on the father's identity.

1638
00:54:04,300 --> 00:54:08,470
From 7:10pm to 7:45pm,

1639
00:54:08,470 --> 00:54:09,510
it was dark.

1640
00:54:09,510 --> 00:54:13,780
"From 7:10pm to 7:45pm, it was dark."

1641
00:54:14,650 --> 00:54:16,550
Kwang Soo isn't the father.

1642
00:54:16,550 --> 00:54:18,620
(Why was it dark during that time?)

1643
00:54:19,050 --> 00:54:20,350
The hints are...

1644
00:54:20,350 --> 00:54:22,220
(Jong Kook is a father candidate.)

1645
00:54:22,220 --> 00:54:24,420
(Where are the walkie-talkies?)

1646
00:54:24,420 --> 00:54:25,620
(What?)

1647
00:54:27,230 --> 00:54:28,860
(At a secluded place,)

1648
00:54:28,860 --> 00:54:31,600
(he finds a walkie-talkie box.)

1649
00:54:32,100 --> 00:54:36,030
The fact that a stranger is trying to steal my family's money...

1650
00:54:36,100 --> 00:54:37,640
makes me upset.

1651
00:54:37,940 --> 00:54:38,940
The stranger.

1652
00:54:40,610 --> 00:54:42,570
I will give you a hint on the stranger.

1653
00:54:43,070 --> 00:54:46,310
The stranger has number eight in his or her birthdate.

1654
00:54:46,510 --> 00:54:48,910
That eliminates Suk Jin and Jong Kook.

1655
00:54:49,680 --> 00:54:52,120
(Suk Jin and Jong Kook don't have the number 8 in their birthdate.)

1656
00:54:53,920 --> 00:54:56,290
I see. Okay.

1657
00:54:56,290 --> 00:54:57,820
That eliminates a lot of people.

1658
00:54:57,920 --> 00:54:59,490
Jong Kook, did you find a hint?

1659
00:55:00,230 --> 00:55:02,090
Yes, I did. I heard a lot.

1660
00:55:03,200 --> 00:55:06,400
- I should go that way. - What?

1661
00:55:06,400 --> 00:55:07,400
(He becomes intimidated...)

1662
00:55:07,400 --> 00:55:09,530
- What's wrong? - What?

1663
00:55:09,530 --> 00:55:10,570
(because Jong Kook is very confident.)

1664
00:55:10,870 --> 00:55:12,000
You aren't...

1665
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:13,910
(He combines the hints.)

1666
00:55:13,910 --> 00:55:16,210
- I am not the father. - You aren't the father.

1667
00:55:16,210 --> 00:55:17,780
The fact they gave out hints which eliminate you...

1668
00:55:17,780 --> 00:55:19,310
from the father candidates early on...

1669
00:55:19,640 --> 00:55:22,450
- tells me you aren't the stranger. - That's right.

1670
00:55:23,750 --> 00:55:24,820
"That's right"?

1671
00:55:24,820 --> 00:55:26,920
I am not the stranger.

1672
00:55:26,920 --> 00:55:29,520
Since you aren't the father, you are useless today.

1673
00:55:29,520 --> 00:55:31,020
(Since you aren't the father, you are useless today.)

1674
00:55:31,020 --> 00:55:34,260
- Why would you say that? - It's true.

1675
00:55:34,930 --> 00:55:36,060
I guess you really aren't the father.

1676
00:55:36,430 --> 00:55:39,130
Ji Hyo isn't the father.

1677
00:55:39,130 --> 00:55:40,300
No, she isn't.

1678
00:55:40,300 --> 00:55:42,200
- So Min isn't the father either. - But...

1679
00:55:42,200 --> 00:55:43,240
(They guess who the father could be.)

1680
00:55:43,240 --> 00:55:45,000
(Ji Hyo, who isn't the father, appears.)

1681
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:46,400
She is nothing today.

1682
00:55:46,570 --> 00:55:47,910
(Is Ji Hyo the stranger?)

1683
00:55:47,910 --> 00:55:49,170
She is nothing today.

1684
00:55:49,170 --> 00:55:51,210
I only have hints on the stranger.

1685
00:55:51,210 --> 00:55:53,450
That's what I am focused on.

1686
00:55:53,450 --> 00:55:55,180
The stranger has 'S'...

1687
00:55:55,210 --> 00:55:57,920
What? Does the stranger's name has 'S'?

1688
00:55:58,020 --> 00:55:59,320
What do you mean?

1689
00:55:59,320 --> 00:56:01,290
- The stranger's name must have S. - Share the hint with us.

1690
00:56:01,290 --> 00:56:03,090
The stranger's name must have an 'S'.

1691
00:56:03,220 --> 00:56:04,520
'S'...

1692
00:56:04,520 --> 00:56:05,660
(Should I share the hint?)

1693
00:56:06,220 --> 00:56:07,530
Is 'S' the stranger?

1694
00:56:08,090 --> 00:56:10,360
I heard this from So Min.

1695
00:56:10,360 --> 00:56:12,030
(I heard this from So Min.)

1696
00:56:12,530 --> 00:56:14,600
- So Min? You heard it from So Min? - She lied.

1697
00:56:14,600 --> 00:56:16,030
The stranger's name doesn't have an 'S'.

1698
00:56:16,100 --> 00:56:17,600
The stranger's name doesn't have 'S'?

1699
00:56:17,600 --> 00:56:20,640
- No, So Min came up with it. - It's like me saying,

1700
00:56:20,640 --> 00:56:22,970
"The stranger's height is less than 190cm."

1701
00:56:23,010 --> 00:56:24,110
It's like me saying that.

1702
00:56:24,110 --> 00:56:26,010
So Min must be the stranger.

1703
00:56:26,010 --> 00:56:28,110
She played you, you fool.

1704
00:56:28,110 --> 00:56:31,320
"The stranger's name doesn't have an 'S'..."

1705
00:56:31,320 --> 00:56:33,950
is So Min's blatant lie.

1706
00:56:33,950 --> 00:56:36,220
- That means she's the stranger. - Ji Hyo.

1707
00:56:36,220 --> 00:56:38,860
- It's proof. - I am glad you told us.

1708
00:56:39,220 --> 00:56:41,560
- Okay, okay. - So Min is the stranger.

1709
00:56:41,760 --> 00:56:44,630
Spread this information, Kwang Soo.

1710
00:56:44,660 --> 00:56:46,570
- Okay. - Spread this information.

1711
00:56:46,570 --> 00:56:47,600
(Is the hint Ji Hyo heard true or false?)

1712
00:56:48,530 --> 00:56:50,740
"It was dark."

1713
00:56:50,740 --> 00:56:52,370
(So Min is trying to figure out the hint on the father.)

1714
00:56:54,240 --> 00:56:55,710
Are you the stranger?

1715
00:56:55,710 --> 00:56:56,710
You are the stranger, right?

1716
00:56:56,710 --> 00:56:58,810
I am not. You want to rip off my name tag, right?

1717
00:56:58,810 --> 00:57:00,310
That's right.

1718
00:57:01,050 --> 00:57:02,810
All of my hints are on the father.

1719
00:57:02,810 --> 00:57:04,480
I have a lot of hints on the father.

1720
00:57:04,520 --> 00:57:07,150
The stranger is either you or Kwang Soo.

1721
00:57:07,350 --> 00:57:10,720
The stranger? I swear I am not the stranger.

1722
00:57:11,020 --> 00:57:13,560
I am leaving. I swear I am not the stranger.

1723
00:57:13,560 --> 00:57:15,530
Don't do that. I am not the stranger.

1724
00:57:16,190 --> 00:57:18,700
Don't you think it's Suk Jin?

1725
00:57:18,730 --> 00:57:20,770
There is no way his acting skills improved so much.

1726
00:57:21,470 --> 00:57:22,730
(Haha enters the lecture hall.)

1727
00:57:22,730 --> 00:57:23,770
This won't do.

1728
00:57:23,770 --> 00:57:27,410
(So Min follows quietly.)

1729
00:57:27,410 --> 00:57:28,610
(Ripping)

1730
00:57:28,610 --> 00:57:29,840
Gosh, I...

1731
00:57:29,840 --> 00:57:31,110
(Haha is out.)

1732
00:57:31,110 --> 00:57:34,010
Child Haha is out.

1733
00:57:34,550 --> 00:57:37,180
Child Haha is out.

1734
00:57:37,180 --> 00:57:39,820
The stranger has gotten to work.

1735
00:57:40,690 --> 00:57:41,820
Gosh, Haha.

1736
00:57:41,820 --> 00:57:43,020
(Who eliminated Haha?)

1737
00:57:43,020 --> 00:57:44,290
Haha.

1738
00:57:45,860 --> 00:57:47,290
So Min has been acting strange.

1739
00:57:47,290 --> 00:57:49,630
She told Ji Hyo that the stranger's name...

1740
00:57:49,630 --> 00:57:51,300
doesn't contain an 'S'.

1741
00:57:51,300 --> 00:57:55,230
She must have come up with that hint to avoid suspicion.

1742
00:57:55,300 --> 00:57:57,840
Running Man never gives out such a hint from the start.

1743
00:57:57,840 --> 00:57:59,840
It's too decisive.

1744
00:57:59,870 --> 00:58:02,810
Gosh, I would have taken it at face value.

1745
00:58:02,810 --> 00:58:03,840
(Both of them have been on the show for 9 years,)

1746
00:58:03,840 --> 00:58:05,010
(but their thought process differs.)

1747
00:58:05,010 --> 00:58:07,280
Think about it, Jae Suk. It's strange.

1748
00:58:07,280 --> 00:58:08,750
- She is here. - Father.

1749
00:58:09,810 --> 00:58:11,220
(The strong stranger candidate, So Min appears.)

1750
00:58:11,220 --> 00:58:13,590
- Father. - Speak of the devil!

1751
00:58:13,590 --> 00:58:15,990
- What should we do? - She is so suspicious.

1752
00:58:15,990 --> 00:58:17,120
What should we do, Jae Suk?

1753
00:58:17,120 --> 00:58:19,360
Father Yoo and Father Kim. I swear I am not the stranger.

1754
00:58:19,360 --> 00:58:20,930
You think I am the stranger, right?

1755
00:58:20,930 --> 00:58:24,630
If you really aren't the stranger, answer one question.

1756
00:58:24,630 --> 00:58:28,370
When you shared a hint with Ji Hyo,

1757
00:58:28,370 --> 00:58:32,540
did you tell her that the stranger's name doesn't have an 'S'?

1758
00:58:32,540 --> 00:58:34,240
- In the stranger's last name. - What?

1759
00:58:34,240 --> 00:58:36,210
The stranger's last name doesn't have an 'S'.

1760
00:58:36,440 --> 00:58:39,210
Ji Hyo didn't say it was the last name.

1761
00:58:39,210 --> 00:58:41,080
She must have heard it wrong.

1762
00:58:41,080 --> 00:58:43,750
I told her it's the last name. I shared the hint...

1763
00:58:43,750 --> 00:58:46,350
because I wanted to find the father.

1764
00:58:46,380 --> 00:58:49,820
- Are you serious? - Yes! Rip off my name tag and see.

1765
00:58:49,920 --> 00:58:51,090
(That makes sense.)

1766
00:58:51,090 --> 00:58:52,390
Should I rip off my name tag?

1767
00:58:52,390 --> 00:58:54,630
Gosh, I am so annoyed. Should I rip off my name tag?

1768
00:58:54,930 --> 00:58:56,830
Should I rip off my name tag? I am not the stranger.

1769
00:58:56,830 --> 00:58:59,100
That's won't do a thing. Stop putting on a show.

1770
00:58:59,330 --> 00:59:03,100
Gosh, it drives me crazy to be falsely accused.

1771
00:59:03,130 --> 00:59:05,640
- My goodness. - I am so exhausted.

1772
00:59:05,640 --> 00:59:09,210
- I am so exhausted today. - There she goes again.

1773
00:59:09,340 --> 00:59:12,740
- She has fooled people this way. - That's right.

1774
00:59:12,810 --> 00:59:14,010
It's suspicious.

1775
00:59:14,010 --> 00:59:15,010
You know,

1776
00:59:15,010 --> 00:59:17,380
she once fooled everyone this way.

1777
00:59:17,380 --> 00:59:19,420
I am so exhausted.

1778
00:59:19,420 --> 00:59:22,220
I know it's wrong, but there are days...

1779
00:59:22,220 --> 00:59:25,460
when I don't try as hard. Today is simply an exception.

1780
00:59:25,460 --> 00:59:27,190
You dropped everything.

1781
00:59:27,190 --> 00:59:29,760
- Get your belongings. - Get your belongings. Stand up.

1782
00:59:29,760 --> 00:59:32,400
- I am exhausted. - Get your senses and belongings.

1783
00:59:32,400 --> 00:59:36,130
- I want to ride on someone's... - Get your belongings.

1784
00:59:36,130 --> 00:59:37,670
(She was so frustrated that her voice went hoarse.)

1785
00:59:37,670 --> 00:59:40,410
Go. We will let you go this once.

1786
00:59:40,810 --> 00:59:43,040
I don't know if you have this hint.

1787
00:59:44,010 --> 00:59:45,810
It's a hint on the father.

1788
00:59:45,810 --> 00:59:48,010
You know what it is, right?

1789
00:59:49,310 --> 00:59:53,220
It's a hint on the father. I am sure you know what it is.

1790
00:59:55,090 --> 00:59:57,220
(It's a drawing of a fox.)

1791
00:59:57,820 --> 00:59:58,820
(Jae Suk has reached his limits.)

1792
00:59:58,820 --> 01:00:00,860
Go.

1793
01:00:00,860 --> 01:00:02,530
- My goodness. - Just go.

1794
01:00:02,530 --> 01:00:04,660
- I am exhausted. - Go before I change my mind.

1795
01:00:04,660 --> 01:00:06,730
(Was So Min acting?)

1796
01:00:07,530 --> 01:00:08,570
There are no walkie-talkies.

1797
01:00:08,570 --> 01:00:10,030
(Kwang Soo is searching for walkie-talkies.)

1798
01:00:10,570 --> 01:00:12,570
(What is that?)

1799
01:00:13,170 --> 01:00:15,210
(Did Kwang Soo find a walkie-talkie box?)

1800
01:00:15,740 --> 01:00:16,910
Darn.

1801
01:00:16,910 --> 01:00:18,410
(Kwang Soo found...)

1802
01:00:18,410 --> 01:00:20,550
(a camera battery.)

1803
01:00:21,110 --> 01:00:22,810
(Frustrated)

1804
01:00:22,810 --> 01:00:24,220
It's a camera battery. I am sorry.

1805
01:00:24,220 --> 01:00:25,920
(It does look similar.)

1806
01:00:26,720 --> 01:00:28,550
(He resumes his search for walkie-talkie boxes.)

1807
01:00:28,550 --> 01:00:30,720
What? It's a platform.

1808
01:00:32,320 --> 01:00:34,830
(This is where the father must type in his identity.)

1809
01:00:34,830 --> 01:00:37,100
This is a platform.

1810
01:00:37,100 --> 01:00:39,830
(The father needs to find the right platform.)

1811
01:00:39,830 --> 01:00:41,000
Hold on. This is...

1812
01:00:41,000 --> 01:00:43,300
(Jae Suk found a platform as well.)

1813
01:00:45,200 --> 01:00:46,470
Gosh, I got goosebumps.

1814
01:00:48,510 --> 01:00:49,970
There is a flower on the screen.

1815
01:00:51,540 --> 01:00:55,750
(Forsythia, rose of Sharon, and cherry blossom)

1816
01:00:56,450 --> 01:00:59,180
- I will write it down. - Let's exchange the hints.

1817
01:00:59,220 --> 01:01:01,650
You and So Min aren't included.

1818
01:01:01,650 --> 01:01:04,660
- Of course not. - The two of you aren't the father.

1819
01:01:04,960 --> 01:01:06,190
That one is a good hint.

1820
01:01:06,420 --> 01:01:08,560
I haven't figured out that one yet.

1821
01:01:11,300 --> 01:01:12,330
Hey.

1822
01:01:13,670 --> 01:01:15,230
That hint exists.

1823
01:01:15,230 --> 01:01:17,470
That hint really exists. Right, Ji Hyo?

1824
01:01:17,470 --> 01:01:19,770
- Stop lying. This is a rabbit. - That hint really exists. Right?

1825
01:01:19,770 --> 01:01:21,770
That hint exists, right? That hint exists.

1826
01:01:22,070 --> 01:01:23,840
You will be surprised later.

1827
01:01:23,840 --> 01:01:25,210
I gave you the entire hint.

1828
01:01:26,440 --> 01:01:28,580
- What is this? - Are you saying it's Suk Jin?

1829
01:01:28,580 --> 01:01:29,980
It's a good hint.

1830
01:01:29,980 --> 01:01:31,850
Stop lying.

1831
01:01:31,850 --> 01:01:34,390
"The father has a big nose."

1832
01:01:34,520 --> 01:01:35,990
That's what I heard.

1833
01:01:36,320 --> 01:01:37,390
(Big nose versus Rabbit)

1834
01:01:37,390 --> 01:01:39,020
- What is this rabbit? - I didn't lie...

1835
01:01:39,020 --> 01:01:42,290
with this one. I gave you a hint.

1836
01:01:42,290 --> 01:01:44,400
"The father is a rabbit." That's a weird hint.

1837
01:01:44,460 --> 01:01:46,000
Both of you are weird.

1838
01:01:46,000 --> 01:01:48,100
- This can't be a hint. - Aren't you the stranger?

1839
01:01:48,930 --> 01:01:51,370
If the stranger gets a hint on the father...

1840
01:01:51,370 --> 01:01:53,100
We shouldn't focus on finding the father.

1841
01:01:53,100 --> 01:01:54,710
- We need to find the stranger. - We need to find the stranger.

1842
01:01:54,710 --> 01:01:55,710
(They have almost no hints on the stranger.)

1843
01:01:55,710 --> 01:01:57,710
- The stranger... - I will go after the father.

1844
01:01:58,310 --> 01:01:59,580
Why? Is that because you are the stranger?

1845
01:01:59,580 --> 01:02:01,080
- No! - You want to eliminate the father.

1846
01:02:01,080 --> 01:02:02,250
No.

1847
01:02:03,780 --> 01:02:06,150
Kwang Soo, go after the stranger. I'll trust you.

1848
01:02:06,150 --> 01:02:08,620
Bring me a hint about the stranger.

1849
01:02:09,150 --> 01:02:12,290
Why do they keep trying to find hints about the stranger?

1850
01:02:13,320 --> 01:02:14,890
Are they trying to take over everything?

1851
01:02:14,890 --> 01:02:16,430
(Who are Kwang Soo and So Min?)

1852
01:02:16,430 --> 01:02:18,660
I need to find a hint.

1853
01:02:18,660 --> 01:02:20,300
(Ji Hyo starts to look for hints.)

1854
01:02:21,170 --> 01:02:24,200
Someone found one here. Will there be another one?

1855
01:02:24,200 --> 01:02:27,740
(Someone follows Ji Hyo quietly.)

1856
01:02:27,740 --> 01:02:29,170
(Tearing)

1857
01:02:29,910 --> 01:02:32,740
Child, Song Ji Hyo is eliminated.

1858
01:02:32,740 --> 01:02:34,280
(Child, Song Ji Hyo is eliminated.)

1859
01:02:34,880 --> 01:02:37,080
See? I knew it.

1860
01:02:38,150 --> 01:02:39,880
Who is the stranger?

1861
01:02:39,880 --> 01:02:42,050
(Who eliminated Ji Hyo?)

1862
01:02:42,190 --> 01:02:44,060
The stranger is definitely So Min.

1863
01:02:44,220 --> 01:02:46,360
That's what I sense.

1864
01:02:46,420 --> 01:02:47,460
It's always...

1865
01:02:48,390 --> 01:02:49,530
Wait.

1866
01:02:49,790 --> 01:02:51,100
These are lockers.

1867
01:02:51,100 --> 01:02:52,800
(On top of lockers,)

1868
01:02:52,800 --> 01:02:54,770
(he finds a walkie-talkie box.)

1869
01:02:55,700 --> 01:02:58,170
I want to get a hint about the stranger.

1870
01:03:00,070 --> 01:03:02,170
The stranger is in his or her 30's.

1871
01:03:02,170 --> 01:03:04,380
(The stranger is in his or her 30's.)

1872
01:03:04,710 --> 01:03:08,380
(Stranger candidates are So Min, Kwang Soo, and Se Chan)

1873
01:03:09,610 --> 01:03:11,380
I think it's So Min.

1874
01:03:11,380 --> 01:03:13,250
(Jong Kook is convinced that So Min is the stranger.)

1875
01:03:13,250 --> 01:03:14,390
I must tear it off.

1876
01:03:15,550 --> 01:03:17,360
(Convinced Jong Kook heads to...)

1877
01:03:17,360 --> 01:03:18,560
So Min is over there.

1878
01:03:18,560 --> 01:03:20,390
(He finds So Min.)

1879
01:03:20,760 --> 01:03:22,730
I have to get rid of So Min.

1880
01:03:23,290 --> 01:03:24,630
Se Chan.

1881
01:03:24,830 --> 01:03:25,960
- What? - Where are you going?

1882
01:03:26,730 --> 01:03:27,970
What?

1883
01:03:28,170 --> 01:03:29,170
(So Min is more suspicious than anyone else.)

1884
01:03:29,170 --> 01:03:30,470
- You. - Yes?

1885
01:03:31,800 --> 01:03:32,800
(He heads straight to So Min.)

1886
01:03:32,800 --> 01:03:33,910
Why are you looking at me cautiously?

1887
01:03:34,840 --> 01:03:36,010
Why are you looking at me cautiously?

1888
01:03:36,710 --> 01:03:38,240
(So Min takes a sudden turn.)

1889
01:03:38,240 --> 01:03:39,380
You could be the stranger.

1890
01:03:39,440 --> 01:03:40,650
- Who? - Jong Kook.

1891
01:03:40,650 --> 01:03:41,680
Me?

1892
01:03:41,810 --> 01:03:43,720
(Jong Kook is excluded from stranger candidates.)

1893
01:03:43,720 --> 01:03:45,680
(Is she cornering Jong Kook as the stranger?)

1894
01:03:46,920 --> 01:03:47,950
So Min.

1895
01:03:47,950 --> 01:03:49,020
(Approaching)

1896
01:03:49,150 --> 01:03:50,150
So Min.

1897
01:03:50,150 --> 01:03:52,390
(Are you the stranger who wants my family's money?)

1898
01:03:53,560 --> 01:03:54,630
To be honest.

1899
01:03:54,730 --> 01:03:56,760
Why are you saying that I could be the stranger?

1900
01:03:57,030 --> 01:03:59,100
What you said confirms it.

1901
01:04:00,430 --> 01:04:02,730
(If Jong Kook is the father and he eliminates the stranger,)

1902
01:04:02,730 --> 01:04:05,240
(he obtains a crucial hint about his own identity.)

1903
01:04:05,940 --> 01:04:07,810
(If Jong Kook and So Min are both children,)

1904
01:04:07,810 --> 01:04:09,510
(both will be eliminated.)

1905
01:04:09,670 --> 01:04:12,380
- Wait. - No, I'm not.

1906
01:04:12,380 --> 01:04:14,150
(So Min was not the stranger.)

1907
01:04:14,150 --> 01:04:16,450
(Jong Kook eliminated So Min who was a child.)

1908
01:04:17,380 --> 01:04:18,450
(If Jong Kook is also a child...)

1909
01:04:18,450 --> 01:04:21,550
- You are not? - I am not.

1910
01:04:21,720 --> 01:04:22,750
Really?

1911
01:04:23,320 --> 01:04:24,860
I'm not the stranger.

1912
01:04:25,320 --> 01:04:26,520
Child, Jong Kook tore off...

1913
01:04:26,520 --> 01:04:28,730
Child, So Min's name tag.

1914
01:04:28,730 --> 01:04:29,930
Both of you are eliminated.

1915
01:04:29,930 --> 01:04:31,160
We're siblings.

1916
01:04:31,560 --> 01:04:33,770
(Jong Kook was also a child.)

1917
01:04:33,930 --> 01:04:34,930
Jong Kook.

1918
01:04:34,930 --> 01:04:37,040
- Why did you give me that hint? - What hint?

1919
01:04:37,040 --> 01:04:38,840
Since Ji Hyo isn't the stranger,

1920
01:04:38,840 --> 01:04:40,200
we wanted to find the father together.

1921
01:04:40,200 --> 01:04:41,910
Why did you talk about the letter 'S' then?

1922
01:04:41,910 --> 01:04:43,010
I received that hint.

1923
01:04:43,010 --> 01:04:45,610
- Is there no 'S' in the last name? - There's no S in the last name.

1924
01:04:45,810 --> 01:04:47,650
I'd like a hint about the stranger.

1925
01:04:47,650 --> 01:04:51,180
There is no 'S' in the stranger's last name.

1926
01:04:51,180 --> 01:04:53,180
(It's the hint that So Min gets.)

1927
01:04:54,190 --> 01:04:55,190
Ji Hyo.

1928
01:04:55,520 --> 01:04:57,520
I found out that you're not the stranger.

1929
01:04:57,820 --> 01:04:59,120
Let's share our hints about the father.

1930
01:04:59,120 --> 01:05:00,320
I'll tell you mine.

1931
01:05:00,390 --> 01:05:01,490
There's no 'S'...

1932
01:05:02,590 --> 01:05:05,230
in the stranger's last name.

1933
01:05:05,330 --> 01:05:06,530
- In the last name? - There's no 'S'.

1934
01:05:06,530 --> 01:05:07,930
Why did Ji Hyo tell me...

1935
01:05:07,930 --> 01:05:08,970
that there's an 'S' in the first name.

1936
01:05:08,970 --> 01:05:10,570
Ji Hyo is forgetful.

1937
01:05:11,570 --> 01:05:13,770
(Is someone talking about me?)

1938
01:05:14,810 --> 01:05:17,840
Child Jong Kook and Child So Min are...

1939
01:05:17,840 --> 01:05:19,110
eliminated.

1940
01:05:21,450 --> 01:05:22,910
So Min wasn't it.

1941
01:05:23,920 --> 01:05:25,420
Four children have been eliminated.

1942
01:05:25,420 --> 01:05:26,620
Only two remain.

1943
01:05:27,650 --> 01:05:28,750
Who is it then?

1944
01:05:28,990 --> 01:05:30,420
Who is the father?

1945
01:05:30,420 --> 01:05:31,590
Is it Jae Suk?

1946
01:05:31,890 --> 01:05:33,220
Who's Jae Suk? What about Kwang Soo?

1947
01:05:33,560 --> 01:05:35,060
Jae Suk, Kwang Soo, and you.

1948
01:05:35,090 --> 01:05:37,230
- You aren't it, are you? - I'm neither father nor stranger.

1949
01:05:37,700 --> 01:05:39,030
Where's Kwang Soo?

1950
01:05:39,030 --> 01:05:40,300
Kwang Soo,

1951
01:05:40,900 --> 01:05:42,430
you, and me. Are there four of us left?

1952
01:05:42,570 --> 01:05:43,970
- Jae Suk. - Jae Suk?

1953
01:05:43,970 --> 01:05:45,000
(Someone is acting.)

1954
01:05:45,270 --> 01:05:46,270
Wait.

1955
01:05:46,370 --> 01:05:48,170
Kwang Soo is the stranger.

1956
01:05:48,270 --> 01:05:50,910
It is Kwang Soo.

1957
01:05:51,080 --> 01:05:52,210
It's not Se Chan.

1958
01:05:52,610 --> 01:05:54,650
(Father candidates are Suk Jin and Jae Suk.)

1959
01:05:55,480 --> 01:05:56,910
There are two children left.

1960
01:05:58,480 --> 01:06:01,450
(Stranger candidates are Kwang Soo and Se Chan.)

1961
01:06:01,450 --> 01:06:02,920
I have no idea.

1962
01:06:02,920 --> 01:06:04,260
What's going on?

1963
01:06:04,260 --> 01:06:05,360
(Who are the father and the stranger?)

1964
01:06:06,290 --> 01:06:09,090
(Jae Suk is looking for hints.)

1965
01:06:09,090 --> 01:06:12,630
(He finds a walkie-talkie box.)

1966
01:06:13,230 --> 01:06:14,370
Let's see.

1967
01:06:14,830 --> 01:06:15,900
There it is.

1968
01:06:17,030 --> 01:06:20,200
(Suk Jin finds something under in the stairs.)

1969
01:06:20,200 --> 01:06:22,640
(He also finds a walkie-talkie box.)

1970
01:06:22,640 --> 01:06:23,810
Okay.

1971
01:06:24,440 --> 01:06:26,180
I'll ask over there.

1972
01:06:26,180 --> 01:06:27,450
Give me a hint about the father.

1973
01:06:27,450 --> 01:06:28,550
(Both ask if they're the father.)

1974
01:06:28,550 --> 01:06:30,720
Give me a hint about the father.

1975
01:06:30,780 --> 01:06:32,880
Here's a hint about the father.

1976
01:06:33,120 --> 01:06:35,890
Father liked the spring, stars,

1977
01:06:35,890 --> 01:06:37,720
and green grapes.

1978
01:06:38,890 --> 01:06:41,360
He liked the spring, stars, and green grapes.

1979
01:06:42,030 --> 01:06:45,060
"Jun Ji Hyun, Song Kang Ho, Kang Ha Neul, Gong Yoo know the father."

1980
01:06:45,060 --> 01:06:48,570
"but Shin Min A, Yeo Jin Goo, and Zo In Sung don't."

1981
01:06:51,340 --> 01:06:54,540
"The father didn't like rabbits, foxes, and pheasants."

1982
01:06:54,540 --> 01:06:56,740
(The father didn't like rabbits, foxes, and pheasants.)

1983
01:06:56,940 --> 01:06:58,980
(What does it mean?)

1984
01:06:59,780 --> 01:07:02,810
(The father didn't like to move around.)

1985
01:07:02,950 --> 01:07:05,380
The father's friends are Lee Sang Hwa,

1986
01:07:05,380 --> 01:07:07,450
Lee Dong Hwi, and Lee Si Young.

1987
01:07:09,550 --> 01:07:11,620
From 7:10pm...

1988
01:07:11,620 --> 01:07:15,130
to 7:45pm, it was dark.

1989
01:07:16,090 --> 01:07:18,530
(Hints about the father)

1990
01:07:18,530 --> 01:07:22,930
(Who is the father that these hints are pointing to?)

1991
01:07:24,400 --> 01:07:25,500
What could it be?

1992
01:07:26,500 --> 01:07:29,110
(He tries to figure out the father.)

1993
01:07:29,940 --> 01:07:31,140
What does it mean?

1994
01:07:31,910 --> 01:07:34,780
(Father candidates can't understand.)

1995
01:07:35,510 --> 01:07:37,420
"The father didn't like rabbits, foxes, and pheasants."

1996
01:07:38,220 --> 01:07:39,950
"Green grapes, stars,"

1997
01:07:39,950 --> 01:07:41,390
and the spring" sound like...

1998
01:07:41,390 --> 01:07:42,550
a poem.

1999
01:07:42,720 --> 01:07:44,620
(Green grapes, spring, and stars)

2000
01:07:44,620 --> 01:07:46,260
I saw them in a textbook.

2001
01:07:46,660 --> 01:07:48,460
It reminded me of that.

2002
01:07:48,460 --> 01:07:51,300
(Words that he might have seen in a textbook)

2003
01:07:51,530 --> 01:07:53,300
Isn't there a movie about a poet?

2004
01:07:53,300 --> 01:07:56,070
(Isn't there a movie about a poet?)

2005
01:07:59,840 --> 01:08:01,110
It's Dong Ju's friend.

2006
01:08:01,110 --> 01:08:02,210
(Kang Ha Neul played the main character in "Dong Ju".)

2007
01:08:03,810 --> 01:08:05,080
Lee Si Young.

2008
01:08:05,080 --> 01:08:06,510
(Father's friends are Lee Sang Hwa, Lee Dong Hwi, and Lee Si Young.)

2009
01:08:06,510 --> 01:08:07,880
Lee Si Young.

2010
01:08:07,980 --> 01:08:12,750
These three are famous activists in the Korean independence movement.

2011
01:08:13,520 --> 01:08:14,650
The afternoon.

2012
01:08:15,150 --> 01:08:18,120
7pm is 19.

2013
01:08:18,620 --> 01:08:21,890
It's from 1910 to 1945.

2014
01:08:23,130 --> 01:08:24,430
Japanese occupation.

2015
01:08:24,430 --> 01:08:26,360
(Japanese occupation)

2016
01:08:27,330 --> 01:08:28,830
I think...

2017
01:08:28,830 --> 01:08:30,970
these are independence movement activists.

2018
01:08:31,070 --> 01:08:33,170
It's related to Yoon Dong Ju.

2019
01:08:34,070 --> 01:08:35,970
Independence movement activist.

2020
01:08:35,970 --> 01:08:37,210
(Is the father an independence movement activist?)

2021
01:08:39,910 --> 01:08:42,680
(The hints meant independence movement activist.)

2022
01:08:42,680 --> 01:08:44,680
We got it all. It's an independence movement activist.

2023
01:08:45,220 --> 01:08:46,450
It was over there.

2024
01:08:46,450 --> 01:08:47,720
(He must enter his identity in the right platform...)

2025
01:08:47,720 --> 01:08:48,890
(to win.)

2026
01:08:49,820 --> 01:08:52,620
(At a place where a platform is hidden,)

2027
01:08:52,620 --> 01:08:53,790
(Suk Jin enters.)

2028
01:08:54,460 --> 01:08:55,690
There's a platform.

2029
01:08:57,160 --> 01:08:58,430
I'll type in independence movement activist.

2030
01:08:58,430 --> 01:09:01,030
(He enters "independence movement activist".)

2031
01:09:01,030 --> 01:09:02,100
Independence...

2032
01:09:02,270 --> 01:09:04,170
movement activist.

2033
01:09:05,000 --> 01:09:08,210
(The platform doesn't open.)

2034
01:09:08,210 --> 01:09:09,340
Is it wrong?

2035
01:09:09,340 --> 01:09:10,910
(Only the father can enter the right answer.)

2036
01:09:10,910 --> 01:09:13,180
(Either it's not the right platform,)

2037
01:09:13,180 --> 01:09:15,850
(or Suk Jin isn't the father.)

2038
01:09:17,010 --> 01:09:19,350
(Jae Suk arrives at the same platform.)

2039
01:09:19,350 --> 01:09:20,520
Forsythia.

2040
01:09:21,050 --> 01:09:22,250
Wait, it was over here.

2041
01:09:22,990 --> 01:09:24,060
Gosh.

2042
01:09:24,660 --> 01:09:26,490
I'm getting goosebumps. Wait.

2043
01:09:27,060 --> 01:09:28,490
It has five syllables.

2044
01:09:28,490 --> 01:09:29,960
(He enters the father's identity in the platform.)

2045
01:09:30,230 --> 01:09:32,100
(It isn't working.)

2046
01:09:32,530 --> 01:09:34,030
(One of them is the father.)

2047
01:09:34,030 --> 01:09:36,670
(The other is a very curious child.)

2048
01:09:37,000 --> 01:09:40,470
(Who is the real father?)

2049
01:09:40,740 --> 01:09:42,670
(At that time)

2050
01:09:42,940 --> 01:09:46,510
(Kwang Soo finds Jae Suk.)

2051
01:09:46,780 --> 01:09:47,880
What is Jae Suk doing?

2052
01:09:49,250 --> 01:09:50,410
What is Jae Suk doing?

2053
01:09:50,850 --> 01:09:52,150
(This is the wrong platform.)

2054
01:09:52,150 --> 01:09:53,820
I don't understand.

2055
01:09:55,020 --> 01:09:59,090
(Why is Jae Suk over there?)

2056
01:09:59,090 --> 01:10:00,420
Only the father uses the platform.

2057
01:10:02,090 --> 01:10:05,660
(If Jae Suk is by the platform...)

2058
01:10:05,660 --> 01:10:06,800
Jae Suk is the father.

2059
01:10:06,800 --> 01:10:09,230
(Is Jae Suk the father?)

2060
01:10:09,300 --> 01:10:10,840
I knew it.

2061
01:10:10,840 --> 01:10:12,840
(Is Jae Suk the father?)

2062
01:10:13,340 --> 01:10:14,810
(Kwang Soo runs into Se Chan.)

2063
01:10:14,810 --> 01:10:15,970
Who are you, Kwang Soo?

2064
01:10:16,110 --> 01:10:17,380
Only two of us are left.

2065
01:10:18,040 --> 01:10:19,340
You still have two cameras.

2066
01:10:19,340 --> 01:10:21,780
(You still have two cameras.)

2067
01:10:21,780 --> 01:10:23,110
- How many do you have? - I have two.

2068
01:10:23,110 --> 01:10:24,920
(It's suspicious.)

2069
01:10:24,920 --> 01:10:26,080
Do you want to sit there?

2070
01:10:26,450 --> 01:10:27,620
Why are you so nervous?

2071
01:10:29,320 --> 01:10:30,350
Are you okay?

2072
01:10:30,350 --> 01:10:31,560
(Kwang Soo seems quite nervous.)

2073
01:10:31,560 --> 01:10:32,560
Why did you write?

2074
01:10:33,460 --> 01:10:35,330
Aren't you being awkward?

2075
01:10:35,730 --> 01:10:37,860
Go over there and read what's written.

2076
01:10:37,860 --> 01:10:39,200
(They keep a distance from one another.)

2077
01:10:39,300 --> 01:10:42,100
(One of them is the stranger.)

2078
01:10:43,130 --> 01:10:44,240
It's Jae Suk.

2079
01:10:45,040 --> 01:10:46,200
What are you doing?

2080
01:10:46,200 --> 01:10:47,910
- I was talking with Kwang Soo. - About what?

2081
01:10:48,310 --> 01:10:50,740
Interestingly enough, one of us is...

2082
01:10:50,740 --> 01:10:52,940
either the father or the stranger.

2083
01:10:53,080 --> 01:10:54,750
- It's very funny. - Right.

2084
01:10:55,210 --> 01:10:57,520
Interestingly enough, both of you came to where I am.

2085
01:10:57,520 --> 01:10:59,150
(They keep a distance.)

2086
01:10:59,150 --> 01:11:00,320
One right after another.

2087
01:11:01,120 --> 01:11:02,250
What's going on?

2088
01:11:03,050 --> 01:11:04,490
Which one of you is the stranger?

2089
01:11:04,890 --> 01:11:06,290
I know who the father is.

2090
01:11:07,560 --> 01:11:09,160
- I... - You know who the father is?

2091
01:11:09,160 --> 01:11:11,030
- Yes. - I think I know too.

2092
01:11:11,630 --> 01:11:12,800
- Do you know? - Yes.

2093
01:11:13,060 --> 01:11:14,200
He's similar to you.

2094
01:11:14,900 --> 01:11:16,830
- Is it me? - I think it's you.

2095
01:11:16,830 --> 01:11:19,600
(Is Jae Suk the father as Kwang Soo and Se Chan think?)

2096
01:11:19,600 --> 01:11:22,410
(Or is Suk Jin the father?)

2097
01:11:22,410 --> 01:11:23,440
(What are their identities?)

2098
01:11:23,440 --> 01:11:25,580
This is what I think.

2099
01:11:26,180 --> 01:11:27,380
I'll be honest.

2100
01:11:28,150 --> 01:11:29,380
Shall I stay away from you?

2101
01:11:29,380 --> 01:11:30,610
(What is he going to say?)

2102
01:11:30,820 --> 01:11:31,880
I'll take everything.

2103
01:11:32,780 --> 01:11:34,220
(If a child eliminates the stranger and the father,)

2104
01:11:34,220 --> 01:11:35,320
(he gets 6,000 dollars.)

2105
01:11:35,320 --> 01:11:36,590
You brat.

2106
01:11:36,920 --> 01:11:38,890
This is just...

2107
01:11:38,890 --> 01:11:40,060
(Is Kwang Soo a child?)

2108
01:11:40,590 --> 01:11:41,760
Goodness.

2109
01:11:41,760 --> 01:11:44,560
(Is he a child? Or is he acting?)

2110
01:11:44,760 --> 01:11:45,830
Hey.

2111
01:11:45,830 --> 01:11:46,860
(At that moment)

2112
01:11:47,900 --> 01:11:49,770
- I'm not it. - Kwang Soo.

2113
01:11:50,030 --> 01:11:51,240
Hey, Kwang Soo.

2114
01:11:51,240 --> 01:11:52,570
Who is the stranger?

2115
01:11:52,570 --> 01:11:54,770
(Who is the stranger?)

2116
01:11:54,770 --> 01:11:56,340
- Wait. - Who's the stranger?

2117
01:11:56,340 --> 01:11:57,410
It's him.

2118
01:11:57,410 --> 01:11:58,810
- Tear off Kwang Soo's. - I'm not it.

2119
01:11:58,810 --> 01:11:59,980
Who's the stranger?

2120
01:11:59,980 --> 01:12:01,510
- Kwang Soo. - Stay still.

2121
01:12:01,510 --> 01:12:02,710
- It's Kwang Soo. - Stay still.

2122
01:12:02,710 --> 01:12:04,780
- Who is it? Who's the stranger? - It's Kwang Soo.

2123
01:12:04,780 --> 01:12:06,450
(Is Kwang Soo the stranger?)

2124
01:12:06,450 --> 01:12:08,590
(Or is Se Chan the stranger?)

2125
01:12:08,590 --> 01:12:09,990
- Who is it? - It's Kwang Soo.

2126
01:12:09,990 --> 01:12:11,620
- I'm not it. - Who's the stranger, Kwang Soo?

2127
01:12:11,620 --> 01:12:12,920
Let's say it at the same time.

2128
01:12:12,920 --> 01:12:14,760
- Wait, who's the stranger? - It's Kwang Soo.

2129
01:12:14,760 --> 01:12:16,030
- It's him. - Who is it?

2130
01:12:16,030 --> 01:12:17,030
- It'll be over! - Who is it?

2131
01:12:17,030 --> 01:12:18,130
- You're going to end it. - Who is it?

2132
01:12:18,130 --> 01:12:19,200
- It's Kwang Soo. - Kwang Soo.

2133
01:12:19,200 --> 01:12:20,800
- Who's the stranger? - Kwang Soo is it.

2134
01:12:20,800 --> 01:12:22,900
- It's Se Chan. - Who is it?

2135
01:12:22,900 --> 01:12:24,070
- It's definitely Kwang Soo. - Wait.

2136
01:12:24,070 --> 01:12:26,140
- It's Se Chan. - Wait, Kwang Soo.

2137
01:12:26,740 --> 01:12:28,610
Kwang Soo, tear of Se Chan's.

2138
01:12:28,670 --> 01:12:30,140
- Who? - Kwang Soo.

2139
01:12:31,580 --> 01:12:32,980
If you're not the stranger,

2140
01:12:32,980 --> 01:12:34,140
I'll tear off Kwang Soo's.

2141
01:12:34,310 --> 01:12:35,680
- Do you understand? - Yes.

2142
01:12:35,680 --> 01:12:37,310
- Then the child will stay alive. - Okay.

2143
01:12:37,310 --> 01:12:38,850
Okay? Wait.

2144
01:12:39,280 --> 01:12:40,580
Wait a minute.

2145
01:12:40,580 --> 01:12:42,050
- Kwang Soo. - Wait.

2146
01:12:42,390 --> 01:12:43,550
Jae Suk.

2147
01:12:43,550 --> 01:12:44,890
- If I'm the child, - It's okay.

2148
01:12:44,890 --> 01:12:46,360
- I'll stay alive. - Right.

2149
01:12:46,360 --> 01:12:47,860
- Do you understand? - Yes.

2150
01:12:47,860 --> 01:12:48,930
Tear it off.

2151
01:12:49,390 --> 01:12:51,430
- Tear it off. - Kwang Soo.

2152
01:12:51,700 --> 01:12:54,630
Tear it off. A child has to be sacrificed.

2153
01:12:55,600 --> 01:12:56,770
No.

2154
01:12:56,770 --> 01:12:58,000
(Se Chan refuses.)

2155
01:12:58,000 --> 01:12:59,140
- Wait. - Who is it?

2156
01:12:59,500 --> 01:13:01,870
(Who is Se Chan?)

2157
01:13:01,870 --> 01:13:03,310
- "Stranger". - Stranger?

2158
01:13:03,410 --> 01:13:04,680
Goodness.

2159
01:13:05,640 --> 01:13:06,940
(Se Chan is the stranger.)

2160
01:13:06,940 --> 01:13:08,680
(Stranger)

2161
01:13:08,680 --> 01:13:10,450
How could this be?

2162
01:13:10,450 --> 01:13:11,820
- Jae Suk. - It was my chance.

2163
01:13:11,820 --> 01:13:13,720
(I worked hard for this chance.)

2164
01:13:14,650 --> 01:13:16,320
(Before the shoot)

2165
01:13:16,320 --> 01:13:17,520
It's been a long time.

2166
01:13:17,520 --> 01:13:20,790
It's been almost two years.

2167
01:13:21,730 --> 01:13:22,990
(He still remembers his failure.)

2168
01:13:22,990 --> 01:13:24,560
You seem nervous already.

2169
01:13:25,830 --> 01:13:27,600
I'm so sleepy. I couldn't sleep last night.

2170
01:13:28,600 --> 01:13:29,630
I hope that it's something easy.

2171
01:13:29,630 --> 01:13:33,470
Se Chan, you're a stranger who's after a family's emergency fund...

2172
01:13:33,470 --> 01:13:34,740
of 6,000 dollars.

2173
01:13:34,740 --> 01:13:36,040
- I'm after it? - Yes.

2174
01:13:36,040 --> 01:13:37,140
(Stranger Yang Se Chan)

2175
01:13:38,280 --> 01:13:40,580
Father is...

2176
01:13:40,580 --> 01:13:41,610
(He searches for hints about the father.)

2177
01:13:41,610 --> 01:13:43,280
I should eliminate Ji Hyo.

2178
01:13:44,250 --> 01:13:45,650
What? Wait.

2179
01:13:45,650 --> 01:13:46,920
I need that.

2180
01:13:46,920 --> 01:13:48,790
(He had to eliminate as many children as possible.)

2181
01:13:49,150 --> 01:13:51,560
(He went after the children to win a bigger prize.)

2182
01:13:51,560 --> 01:13:53,090
Se Chan is the stranger.

2183
01:13:53,090 --> 01:13:55,590
(Ji Hyo who was definitely a child is eliminated.)

2184
01:13:55,590 --> 01:13:57,630
I knew that you were the stranger from the beginning.

2185
01:13:59,760 --> 01:14:02,770
(He figures things out quietly by himself.)

2186
01:14:02,770 --> 01:14:05,140
(He also eliminates Haha.)

2187
01:14:05,270 --> 01:14:06,600
Goodness.

2188
01:14:07,240 --> 01:14:08,770
I just checked this.

2189
01:14:09,040 --> 01:14:10,770
Get out quietly now.

2190
01:14:10,770 --> 01:14:12,410
Haha was so easy.

2191
01:14:12,410 --> 01:14:13,540
(He eliminated children while hiding his identity.)

2192
01:14:14,310 --> 01:14:17,350
Stranger Se Chan is eliminated.

2193
01:14:17,350 --> 01:14:18,420
Jae Suk.

2194
01:14:18,620 --> 01:14:19,850
Wait.

2195
01:14:20,580 --> 01:14:22,050
That means you'll take everything.

2196
01:14:22,050 --> 01:14:23,450
No, Jae Suk.

2197
01:14:23,690 --> 01:14:25,190
- So? - Wait.

2198
01:14:25,190 --> 01:14:26,490
I'm your sibling.

2199
01:14:26,490 --> 01:14:28,290
- Wait a minute. - I'm your sibling.

2200
01:14:28,590 --> 01:14:29,930
Se Chan is the stranger.

2201
01:14:29,930 --> 01:14:31,260
- I won't take all the money. - Hey.

2202
01:14:32,230 --> 01:14:33,300
- I won't take all the money. - Hey.

2203
01:14:33,300 --> 01:14:37,470
(Kwang Soo goes after Jae Suk's name tag.)

2204
01:14:38,240 --> 01:14:41,610
(Jae Suk stands at the platform to find out the father's identity.)

2205
01:14:42,010 --> 01:14:44,510
(Is Jae Suk the father?)

2206
01:14:44,510 --> 01:14:45,510
What is Jae Suk doing?

2207
01:14:45,510 --> 01:14:47,010
- I won't take all the money. - Hey.

2208
01:14:47,210 --> 01:14:50,310
If a child eliminates the stranger and the father,

2209
01:14:50,310 --> 01:14:53,020
he gets 6,000 dollars all to himself.

2210
01:14:53,250 --> 01:14:54,320
Wait, your hand.

2211
01:14:54,320 --> 01:14:58,020
(If Jae Suk is the father, Kwang Soo can take all the money.)

2212
01:14:58,790 --> 01:14:59,860
Hurry.

2213
01:14:59,860 --> 01:15:01,790
(If Suk Jin is the father, Jae Suk and Kwang Soo are both out.)

2214
01:15:01,790 --> 01:15:02,790
Your hand.

2215
01:15:04,400 --> 01:15:05,860
(Tearing)

2216
01:15:06,800 --> 01:15:09,500
(The name tag is off.)

2217
01:15:09,730 --> 01:15:11,540
(Who is Jae Suk?)

2218
01:15:11,540 --> 01:15:12,970
We're eliminated.

2219
01:15:12,970 --> 01:15:14,240
Both of you are eliminated.

2220
01:15:14,470 --> 01:15:16,170
We're eliminated.

2221
01:15:16,170 --> 01:15:17,370
Both of you are eliminated.

2222
01:15:17,470 --> 01:15:19,780
Why did you tear off my name tag?

2223
01:15:20,080 --> 01:15:22,150
(As they're both children, they're both eliminated.)

2224
01:15:22,150 --> 01:15:23,350
What's wrong with you?

2225
01:15:24,920 --> 01:15:26,750
- Lee Kwang Soo. - Aren't you the father?

2226
01:15:28,620 --> 01:15:30,820
Suk Jin is the father.

2227
01:15:31,160 --> 01:15:33,220
Both children are eliminated.

2228
01:15:33,220 --> 01:15:34,990
Why you...

2229
01:15:34,990 --> 01:15:36,560
(What are you talking about?)

2230
01:15:36,860 --> 01:15:40,230
Suk Jin, you're a secret agent who lost his memory.

2231
01:15:40,230 --> 01:15:42,330
You're a father of six children.

2232
01:15:42,330 --> 01:15:45,540
(Father Ji Suk Jin)

2233
01:15:45,600 --> 01:15:47,970
If I get caught early, is it okay that the shoot ends early?

2234
01:15:47,970 --> 01:15:50,540
The staff decided to risk it.

2235
01:15:51,740 --> 01:15:54,680
(Such honesty makes him laugh.)

2236
01:15:54,680 --> 01:15:55,810
- I'll show you. - Okay.

2237
01:15:55,810 --> 01:15:58,320
Please look forward to my amazing performance.

2238
01:15:58,320 --> 01:16:01,950
The stranger and remaining children are eliminated.

2239
01:16:01,950 --> 01:16:05,090
Therefore Suk Jin wins.

2240
01:16:07,160 --> 01:16:11,030
(He won without doing anything.)

2241
01:16:11,030 --> 01:16:13,360
I can't believe that I won this way.

2242
01:16:13,360 --> 01:16:14,700
(He won without doing much.)

2243
01:16:16,230 --> 01:16:18,840
I didn't want to win without accomplishing anything.

2244
01:16:19,000 --> 01:16:20,270
Okay, let's go.

2245
01:16:20,270 --> 01:16:22,970
(Suk Jin's one-man show that started with regrets)

2246
01:16:23,470 --> 01:16:24,910
(Suk Jin arrives at the platform.)

2247
01:16:24,910 --> 01:16:26,240
I hope this is correct.

2248
01:16:27,440 --> 01:16:29,910
"Independence". Is this correct?

2249
01:16:30,450 --> 01:16:31,680
"Movement activist."

2250
01:16:32,250 --> 01:16:33,550
Is it correct?

2251
01:16:33,550 --> 01:16:35,290
(You won! Watch the video with the other members.)

2252
01:16:35,290 --> 01:16:37,450
(Wow.)

2253
01:16:37,450 --> 01:16:38,990
(Yes.)

2254
01:16:39,320 --> 01:16:40,490
This is amazing.

2255
01:16:40,790 --> 01:16:41,960
Was it right?

2256
01:16:41,960 --> 01:16:43,260
(He performs with enthusiasm.)

2257
01:16:43,260 --> 01:16:45,130
Thank you. I was an independence movement activist.

2258
01:16:46,430 --> 01:16:48,430
Long live Korean independence.

2259
01:16:48,430 --> 01:16:50,800
(Long live Korean independence. The end of his one-man show)

2260
01:16:51,440 --> 01:16:54,140
The winner of the Missing Emergency Fund Race is...

2261
01:16:54,140 --> 01:16:56,210
the father, Suk Jin.

2262
01:16:56,210 --> 01:16:59,310
(The final winner is Suk Jin.)

2263
01:16:59,310 --> 01:17:01,880
Good job. Due to Kwang Soo, we were eliminated.

2264
01:17:01,880 --> 01:17:03,580
I thought it was definitely Jae Suk.

2265
01:17:03,580 --> 01:17:04,980
- I thought he was the father. - You got greedy.

2266
01:17:04,980 --> 01:17:07,080
You must be curious about...

2267
01:17:07,080 --> 01:17:08,650
who the father is.

2268
01:17:08,650 --> 01:17:11,720
- Let's watch the video together. - Okay.

2269
01:17:12,590 --> 01:17:14,160
(I did not...)

2270
01:17:14,160 --> 01:17:16,190
(know...)

2271
01:17:16,190 --> 01:17:19,130
(who my father was.)

2272
01:17:23,070 --> 01:17:24,430
(Father hid money under the bed.)

2273
01:17:24,430 --> 01:17:26,770
(However he was miserly and made his children work.)

2274
01:17:26,770 --> 01:17:28,210
The father hid money.

2275
01:17:30,110 --> 01:17:31,410
(Until I was 12 years old,)

2276
01:17:31,410 --> 01:17:34,440
(I never saw my father's face properly.)

2277
01:17:36,710 --> 01:17:38,850
(Due to our father's absence, we didn't have food to eat.)

2278
01:17:38,850 --> 01:17:41,390
(We ate vegetables from restaurants' trash to keep from hunger.)

2279
01:17:42,620 --> 01:17:45,860
(Due to our father, we had a very difficult life.)

2280
01:17:50,660 --> 01:17:53,430
(Then we found out after our father died.)

2281
01:17:54,330 --> 01:17:56,100
(Our father was...)

2282
01:17:56,100 --> 01:17:58,340
(an activist in the Korean independence movement.)

2283
01:17:58,340 --> 01:17:59,770
See? I knew it.

2284
01:17:59,770 --> 01:18:02,110
(To protect his beloved family, he hid his identity.)

2285
01:18:02,110 --> 01:18:03,710
I got goosebumps right now.

2286
01:18:03,710 --> 01:18:06,210
(To protect his beloved family, he hid his identity.)

2287
01:18:07,280 --> 01:18:08,580
(Money that our father collected under the bed was...)

2288
01:18:08,580 --> 01:18:11,880
(the independence fund to deliver to the provisional government.)

2289
01:18:12,550 --> 01:18:14,050
(We couldn't see our father often...)

2290
01:18:14,050 --> 01:18:17,320
(because he was busy with independence movements abroad.)

2291
01:18:18,090 --> 01:18:19,520
(We were always hungry...)

2292
01:18:19,520 --> 01:18:22,960
(because our land and house were sold to fund the movement.)

2293
01:18:24,190 --> 01:18:27,030
(Our father loved us more than anyone.)

2294
01:18:27,030 --> 01:18:31,640
(He was a proud activist in the Korean independence movement.)

2295
01:18:31,640 --> 01:18:33,000
It's moving.

2296
01:18:33,000 --> 01:18:34,840
(Father was an activist in the Korean independence movement.)

2297
01:18:34,840 --> 01:18:37,770
Our independence fund was...

2298
01:18:37,770 --> 01:18:39,840
The 6,000 dollars was for the independence movement.

2299
01:18:39,840 --> 01:18:41,180
The 6,000 dollars represented...

2300
01:18:41,180 --> 01:18:43,880
the funds from Lee Hoe Yeong who founded Shinheung Military Academy.

2301
01:18:43,880 --> 01:18:46,480
He gave everything he had for the independence movement.

2302
01:18:46,480 --> 01:18:47,820
I feel so bad.

2303
01:18:47,820 --> 01:18:49,820
I spoke nonsense during the opening of the show.

2304
01:18:49,820 --> 01:18:51,320
Family members of independence movement activists...

2305
01:18:51,320 --> 01:18:53,590
resented their fathers very much before finding out...

2306
01:18:53,590 --> 01:18:55,460
- who their fathers were. - Right.

2307
01:18:55,460 --> 01:18:57,960
They misunderstood when...

2308
01:18:57,960 --> 01:18:59,400
their fathers took money from the family.

2309
01:18:59,400 --> 01:19:02,800
Today's real theme is the secret of the father.

2310
01:19:02,800 --> 01:19:04,300
Father's identity is an independence movement activist.

2311
01:19:04,300 --> 01:19:05,970
It warms my heart.

2312
01:19:05,970 --> 01:19:07,740
I got tears in my eyes as I was watching it.

2313
01:19:07,740 --> 01:19:10,740
The father's letter you read that sounded cold reflected...

2314
01:19:10,740 --> 01:19:13,610
how they had to keep their identities secret...

2315
01:19:13,610 --> 01:19:15,250
to protect their families.

2316
01:19:15,250 --> 01:19:16,280
Right.

2317
01:19:16,280 --> 01:19:18,420
They were cold to their families in reality.

2318
01:19:18,420 --> 01:19:20,420
- They had to keep their secret. - Yes.

2319
01:19:20,420 --> 01:19:21,690
To prevent information from leaking.

2320
01:19:21,690 --> 01:19:23,020
(Yoon Bong Gil's letter to his two sons,)

2321
01:19:23,020 --> 01:19:24,390
(Yoon Jong and Yoon Dam)

2322
01:19:24,390 --> 01:19:26,590
(Did you say that you were jealous of Doo Soon for having a father?)

2323
01:19:26,590 --> 01:19:29,390
I'll explain the three dishes you had for lunch.

2324
01:19:29,390 --> 01:19:31,900
The braised kimchi was made by Kim Gu's mother,

2325
01:19:31,900 --> 01:19:33,500
Kwak Nak Won.

2326
01:19:33,500 --> 01:19:35,100
She picked cabbage leaves that were thrown away on the ground...

2327
01:19:35,100 --> 01:19:36,830
and made this dish for independence activists.

2328
01:19:37,200 --> 01:19:41,340
Pyeongyang naengmyeon was Kim Gu's favorite dish.

2329
01:19:41,340 --> 01:19:44,680
Seafood stew is what Seo Young Hae ate in France...

2330
01:19:44,680 --> 01:19:46,910
while he fought abroad for Korean independence.

2331
01:19:47,580 --> 01:19:49,650
I see. I had no idea.

2332
01:19:49,650 --> 01:19:52,280
"Jun Ji Hyun, Song Kang Ho, Kang Ha Neul, Gong Yoo know the father,"

2333
01:19:52,280 --> 01:19:54,150
"but Shin Min A, Yeo Jin Goo, and Zo In Sung don't."

2334
01:19:54,150 --> 01:19:56,550
These are the actors in movies such as "Assassinations"...

2335
01:19:56,550 --> 01:19:58,860
and "The Age of Shadows"...

2336
01:19:58,860 --> 01:19:59,990
that relate to the independence movement.

2337
01:20:00,620 --> 01:20:04,660
The hint that said "Father didn't like rabbits, foxes, and pheasants."

2338
01:20:04,660 --> 01:20:06,960
That was jargon used by independence movement activists.

2339
01:20:06,960 --> 01:20:08,970
So rabbits meant Japanese police,

2340
01:20:08,970 --> 01:20:10,030
foxes meant Japanese secret agents,

2341
01:20:10,030 --> 01:20:12,770
and pheasants meant Japanese collaborators.

2342
01:20:13,500 --> 01:20:14,910
- What about the moving around hint? - I know.

2343
01:20:14,910 --> 01:20:17,010
"Moving around" is a Japanese expression.

2344
01:20:17,010 --> 01:20:19,140
"Going back and forth" is a Korean expression.

2345
01:20:19,710 --> 01:20:22,080
The other expression is from Japanese.

2346
01:20:22,710 --> 01:20:25,550
The stranger's identity had many meanings.

2347
01:20:25,550 --> 01:20:27,380
It could have been a Japanese soldier,

2348
01:20:27,380 --> 01:20:29,150
a Japanese collaborator,

2349
01:20:29,150 --> 01:20:31,690
or someone who ignored the independence movement.

2350
01:20:31,690 --> 01:20:33,660
- An informant. - It could also represent us...

2351
01:20:33,660 --> 01:20:36,360
who are indifferent.

2352
01:20:36,660 --> 01:20:38,300
Why did you pick me...

2353
01:20:38,300 --> 01:20:40,030
to represent a Japanese collaborator or an informant.

2354
01:20:40,030 --> 01:20:41,730
To represent a Japanese collaborator or an informant.

2355
01:20:41,730 --> 01:20:43,100
I'll eliminate you.

2356
01:20:43,230 --> 01:20:44,400
Was it me?

2357
01:20:44,400 --> 01:20:46,440
Fine, I'll accept it.

2358
01:20:47,270 --> 01:20:48,710
I was the best choice.

2359
01:20:49,370 --> 01:20:52,240
The 6,000 dollars that Suk Jin won...

2360
01:20:52,240 --> 01:20:54,480
will be donated to Korean independence organization...

2361
01:20:54,480 --> 01:20:56,480
and will cover for any penalties incurred today.

2362
01:20:56,680 --> 01:20:58,320
That's amazing, Suk Jin.

2363
01:20:58,320 --> 01:21:00,550
- Give it with joy. - I'll feel better this way.

2364
01:21:00,550 --> 01:21:01,950
- Seriously. - Of course.

2365
01:21:01,950 --> 01:21:04,190
- It's the right thing to do. - You're amazing.

2366
01:21:04,190 --> 01:21:08,030
We learned a lot today.

2367
01:21:08,030 --> 01:21:11,060
- Yes. - It's history that...

2368
01:21:11,060 --> 01:21:12,500
we should not forget.

2369
01:21:12,500 --> 01:21:15,770
We can live on this land today.

2370
01:21:15,770 --> 01:21:18,340
I say this all the time.

2371
01:21:18,340 --> 01:21:21,910
They protected us with their blood and tears.

2372
01:21:22,210 --> 01:21:25,440
As there were many independence movement activists,

2373
01:21:25,440 --> 01:21:27,580
we could live in this country today.

2374
01:21:27,580 --> 01:21:30,280
We thank them again wholeheartedly.

2375
01:21:30,280 --> 01:21:31,680
- Thank you. - We won't forget you.

2376
01:21:31,680 --> 01:21:33,180
Thank you.

2377
01:21:35,290 --> 01:21:38,060
(Members are involved in a dangerous competition.)

2378
01:21:38,060 --> 01:21:40,520
(Whatever they choose, it's for the final victory.)

2379
01:21:40,520 --> 01:21:42,590
(They have only one chance to bet.)

2380
01:21:42,930 --> 01:21:45,460
(To members who can't make a daring bet)

2381
01:21:45,760 --> 01:21:48,000
(The real ones appeared.)

2382
01:21:48,000 --> 01:21:50,100
(They came to put an end to this round.)

2383
01:21:50,100 --> 01:21:52,800
(Difficult opponents are here.)

2384
01:21:52,800 --> 01:21:54,740
(It's hard to know their strategy.)

2385
01:21:54,740 --> 01:21:56,410
(They're tricksters.)

2386
01:21:56,410 --> 01:21:58,340
(A competition with the real ones)

2387
01:21:58,340 --> 01:22:01,610
(Who will be the final winner?)

2388
01:22:01,950 --> 01:22:05,680
(Deity of Games: Don't Trust Anyone)
