1
00:00:05,420 --> 00:00:06,420
(At last,)

2
00:00:06,420 --> 00:00:07,965
(the day has come.)

3
00:00:08,190 --> 00:00:09,359
(9 Years of Running Man)

4
00:00:09,359 --> 00:00:11,529
(The fan-meet of Running Man is finally held.)

5
00:00:11,529 --> 00:00:15,030
(The race starts.)

6
00:00:15,030 --> 00:00:17,329
(To repay the support of 9 years from their fans,)

7
00:00:17,329 --> 00:00:19,700
(they went on a long journey of 100 days in preparing...)

8
00:00:19,700 --> 00:00:22,540
(the first fan-meet of Running Man in Korea.)

9
00:00:22,540 --> 00:00:25,709
(A fancy transformation of members you can only see here)

10
00:00:25,709 --> 00:00:28,810
(A series of thrilling performances with an explosion of talent)

11
00:00:28,810 --> 00:00:31,709
(For 9 years, the fans have kept Running Man going.)

12
00:00:31,709 --> 00:00:35,194
(And the members share their sincerest appreciation with them.)

13
00:00:35,650 --> 00:00:38,089
(The grand finale of the fan-meet...)

14
00:00:38,089 --> 00:00:41,594
(will be revealed shortly.)

15
00:00:42,530 --> 00:00:44,904
(And last week)

16
00:00:45,159 --> 00:00:47,430
(Solve the Secret in Prophecy: Find the Deity Race)

17
00:00:47,430 --> 00:00:49,430
(Protect the deity of light and the prophet.)

18
00:00:49,430 --> 00:00:51,400
(Eliminate deity of darkness.)

19
00:00:51,470 --> 00:00:52,470
Good job!

20
00:00:52,470 --> 00:00:55,369
(A fierce war to win hints about the deities and prophet.)

21
00:00:55,369 --> 00:00:57,640
(Everyone showed awful dance skills.)

22
00:00:57,640 --> 00:01:00,079
(And the worst dancer shows up.)

23
00:01:00,079 --> 00:01:01,685
(I'm Crazy So Min!)

24
00:01:01,879 --> 00:01:04,185
(Jong Kook and Sunny get a hint after winning the mission.)

25
00:01:04,509 --> 00:01:05,850
(The deity of darkness debuted over 10 years ago.)

26
00:01:05,850 --> 00:01:07,295
(The prophet isn't in his or her 50s.)

27
00:01:07,549 --> 00:01:09,794
(Say a math formula you know.)

28
00:01:09,949 --> 00:01:12,395
(The mention of a math formula spikes up her blood pressure.)

29
00:01:12,889 --> 00:01:14,889
(You must stay calm even when they ask you...)

30
00:01:14,889 --> 00:01:15,889
(flustering questions.)

31
00:01:15,889 --> 00:01:17,559
(He's the calmest.)

32
00:01:17,559 --> 00:01:19,535
(Jong Kook is so calm.)

33
00:01:19,729 --> 00:01:22,999
(Haha and Jang Ye Won wins a hint after a mission.)

34
00:01:22,999 --> 00:01:25,540
(Kwang Soo and Sun Mi win a hint too.)

35
00:01:25,540 --> 00:01:27,975
(The deity of darkness was not born in the Year of the Horse.)

36
00:01:28,270 --> 00:01:29,609
(What?)

37
00:01:29,609 --> 00:01:31,639
(But...)

38
00:01:31,639 --> 00:01:35,180
(there's a picture on the back of the hint card?)

39
00:01:35,180 --> 00:01:36,255
(there's a picture on the back of the hint card?)

40
00:01:36,850 --> 00:01:39,719
(What do the pictures on the hint cards mean?)

41
00:01:39,719 --> 00:01:42,389
The hint for the deity of darkness is at stake on this group mission.

42
00:01:42,389 --> 00:01:44,990
It's Upgraded Speak with Your Actions.

43
00:01:44,990 --> 00:01:46,595
(Upgraded Speak with Your Actions)

44
00:01:46,719 --> 00:01:50,330
The staff will give you a keyword. All six of you will have...

45
00:01:50,330 --> 00:01:52,359
10 seconds to describe the keyword only through your actions.

46
00:01:52,359 --> 00:01:54,375
The last member will have to get the keyword right.

47
00:01:54,529 --> 00:01:56,800
If you get at least 1 keyword right out of 2,

48
00:01:56,800 --> 00:02:00,900
all six of you will get a hint about the deity of darkness.

49
00:02:00,900 --> 00:02:03,009
- This is important. - It's a good one.

50
00:02:03,009 --> 00:02:04,910
If one of us is the deity, that person will ruin our chance.

51
00:02:04,910 --> 00:02:07,315
- Right. We must do our best. - The deity of darkness.

52
00:02:07,339 --> 00:02:10,080
After discussing it among yourselves, pick your spots.

53
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:11,184
- Okay. - Okay.

54
00:02:11,910 --> 00:02:14,349
- This keyword is about a place. - Place.

55
00:02:14,349 --> 00:02:16,065
- Okay. - It's a place.

56
00:02:16,189 --> 00:02:18,294
Ready, set, go.

57
00:02:18,890 --> 00:02:22,204
(Public restroom)

58
00:02:23,129 --> 00:02:24,129
Go ahead.

59
00:02:24,129 --> 00:02:25,905
- It must be hard. He just sighed. - He signed.

60
00:02:26,629 --> 00:02:28,400
(Man and woman)

61
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:30,775
(In a rectangular slot...)

62
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:32,775
(Checking)

63
00:02:34,999 --> 00:02:37,010
- That's it. Turn around now. - That's it?

64
00:02:37,010 --> 00:02:38,110
- Hold on. - Okay.

65
00:02:38,110 --> 00:02:40,215
- Ten seconds have already passed. - Let me organize my thoughts first.

66
00:02:40,510 --> 00:02:41,585
Is Haha the deity of darkness?

67
00:02:42,349 --> 00:02:43,710
(Public restroom)

68
00:02:43,710 --> 00:02:45,255
(Woman and man)

69
00:02:45,819 --> 00:02:47,879
(She opens up...)

70
00:02:47,879 --> 00:02:49,565
(the rectangular slot.)

71
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:51,065
There you go.

72
00:02:51,990 --> 00:02:54,490
- Your 10 seconds are up. - There you go. Yes.

73
00:02:54,490 --> 00:02:56,704
(She strikes a pose to do her business.)

74
00:02:56,890 --> 00:02:58,930
- I think I know. Aren't I right? - What is that?

75
00:02:58,930 --> 00:03:01,505
- Yes. You're right. - You were trying to describe this.

76
00:03:01,860 --> 00:03:02,999
Is it that hard?

77
00:03:02,999 --> 00:03:04,069
(It's Seok Jin's turn.)

78
00:03:04,069 --> 00:03:05,715
Just do exactly what I did.

79
00:03:06,439 --> 00:03:07,514
What?

80
00:03:07,999 --> 00:03:09,245
- What? - What?

81
00:03:09,610 --> 00:03:11,409
(Flicking his finger)

82
00:03:11,409 --> 00:03:12,409
Did you do that?

83
00:03:12,409 --> 00:03:14,080
(His finger messes it up.)

84
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:15,339
(Did you do that?)

85
00:03:15,339 --> 00:03:17,249
Not at all. You saw how I described it.

86
00:03:17,249 --> 00:03:19,249
- Exactly. Seok Jin. - Did he do something weird?

87
00:03:19,249 --> 00:03:21,550
- Your time is up. Ji Hyo, go ahead. - Seok Jin seems fishy.

88
00:03:21,550 --> 00:03:22,664
(What is that?)

89
00:03:22,819 --> 00:03:24,894
- That was so weird. - What do you mean?

90
00:03:25,319 --> 00:03:27,319
Your description didn't make sense.

91
00:03:27,319 --> 00:03:29,164
- What was that? - Did he do something weird?

92
00:03:29,830 --> 00:03:32,005
(Woman and woman, It's getting worse.)

93
00:03:32,460 --> 00:03:34,275
(In a box...)

94
00:03:35,029 --> 00:03:37,104
(Going back and forth)

95
00:03:37,230 --> 00:03:38,300
Ji Hyo.

96
00:03:38,369 --> 00:03:39,539
(After opening the door and entering,)

97
00:03:39,539 --> 00:03:40,770
Your time is up.

98
00:03:40,770 --> 00:03:43,409
(you sit and entice someone.)

99
00:03:43,409 --> 00:03:45,345
(Come on in.)

100
00:03:45,710 --> 00:03:47,010
- What? - What is that?

101
00:03:47,010 --> 00:03:48,185
Ji Hyo.

102
00:03:48,409 --> 00:03:51,480
See, Seok Jin? My gosh. It's 100 percent him.

103
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:52,480
I didn't get it either.

104
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:54,454
- Come on. - But how could you not?

105
00:03:55,319 --> 00:03:59,364
(While Seok Jin's finger action is messing it up, Ye Won begins.)

106
00:04:00,119 --> 00:04:02,805
(Confused)

107
00:04:03,629 --> 00:04:05,659
- Hold on. How? What's that? - Your time is up.

108
00:04:05,659 --> 00:04:06,730
(She finishes up with the finger.)

109
00:04:06,730 --> 00:04:08,360
(What's up with the finger?)

110
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:10,330
- All right. What's the answer? - Hold on.

111
00:04:10,330 --> 00:04:11,330
It's a place, right?

112
00:04:11,330 --> 00:04:12,499
- Yes, it is. - I think I know.

113
00:04:12,499 --> 00:04:14,200
You can figure it out. You can do it.

114
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:16,909
You and I open up the door and go inside.

115
00:04:16,909 --> 00:04:18,010
(Remembering the description again)

116
00:04:18,010 --> 00:04:20,110
- All right. "Come in"? - "Come in."

117
00:04:20,110 --> 00:04:22,609
See? Because of that, the whole thing changed.

118
00:04:22,609 --> 00:04:24,250
- Wait. It's not that place, is it? - I'll give you five seconds.

119
00:04:24,250 --> 00:04:25,754
I don't get it.

120
00:04:26,380 --> 00:04:28,450
- What are you thinking about? - Come on.

121
00:04:28,479 --> 00:04:30,750
A man and a woman go... I can't say that, right?

122
00:04:30,750 --> 00:04:31,919
Where are you going?

123
00:04:31,919 --> 00:04:34,095
- Okay. I got it. - What's the answer?

124
00:04:34,260 --> 00:04:35,320
The answer is...

125
00:04:35,320 --> 00:04:36,929
5, 4,

126
00:04:36,929 --> 00:04:38,029
- He doesn't know. - Three...

127
00:04:38,029 --> 00:04:39,029
An inn?

128
00:04:39,029 --> 00:04:41,630
(An inn?)

129
00:04:41,630 --> 00:04:43,700
- The answer is the public restroom. - What?

130
00:04:43,770 --> 00:04:46,200
- That was the mildest answer I had. - Hold on. Wait.

131
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:49,184
Here's why. Seok Jin did this out of the blue.

132
00:04:49,909 --> 00:04:52,179
- That came out of nowhere. - Why did you do that?

133
00:04:52,210 --> 00:04:55,010
- You did that. Didn't you? - I didn't. When did I do that?

134
00:04:55,010 --> 00:04:56,479
- Why do this in the restroom? - I thought...

135
00:04:56,479 --> 00:04:57,909
- You did that too. - Yes.

136
00:04:57,909 --> 00:04:59,349
- I did that too. - What is this?

137
00:04:59,349 --> 00:05:01,120
Gosh, something is fishy about you.

138
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:03,549
- Something is fishy. - What do you think about that?

139
00:05:03,549 --> 00:05:04,750
- Who wants to go first? - Let's switch.

140
00:05:04,750 --> 00:05:05,919
- Let's switch. We should... - Let's switch.

141
00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:07,419
- Sunny, do you want to go first? - because...

142
00:05:07,419 --> 00:05:09,390
- This is your spot, Seok Jin. - Seok Jin should go second.

143
00:05:09,390 --> 00:05:11,390
You'll know which one seems suspicious from there.

144
00:05:11,390 --> 00:05:12,400
(Seok Jin will go second.)

145
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:13,900
Here's your next keyword.

146
00:05:13,900 --> 00:05:16,804
The category is food.

147
00:05:16,929 --> 00:05:17,969
Start.

148
00:05:17,969 --> 00:05:21,075
(Jjamjjamyeon)

149
00:05:21,799 --> 00:05:22,885
(How will Sunny describe jjamjjamyeon?)

150
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:24,440
Right away?

151
00:05:24,440 --> 00:05:25,640
(There's a round bowl.)

152
00:05:25,640 --> 00:05:26,640
(It's halved.)

153
00:05:26,640 --> 00:05:27,710
(As for jjajangmyeon,)

154
00:05:27,710 --> 00:05:29,479
(we slurp the noodles.)

155
00:05:29,479 --> 00:05:31,650
(As for jjamppong, we drink the soup.)

156
00:05:31,650 --> 00:05:32,754
Stop.

157
00:05:32,820 --> 00:05:34,349
Seok Jin. Get ready to describe it.

158
00:05:34,349 --> 00:05:36,424
What on earth is that?

159
00:05:36,820 --> 00:05:37,919
(Half...)

160
00:05:37,919 --> 00:05:39,535
(a circle.)

161
00:05:40,260 --> 00:05:41,620
(Slurping jjajangmyeon)

162
00:05:41,620 --> 00:05:42,705
(That's it.)

163
00:05:43,229 --> 00:05:44,729
(And as for jjamppong,)

164
00:05:44,729 --> 00:05:46,000
(drink the whole cup.)

165
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,604
- What? - Stop.

166
00:05:47,830 --> 00:05:50,445
(The paper cup shows up all of a sudden.)

167
00:05:51,130 --> 00:05:52,244
Please continue.

168
00:05:53,270 --> 00:05:55,640
- I didn't do that. I did this. - Juice.

169
00:05:55,640 --> 00:05:57,984
That's not it. Why did you do that?

170
00:05:58,070 --> 00:05:59,810
(The first step is wrong.)

171
00:05:59,810 --> 00:06:01,380
(Half a square.)

172
00:06:01,380 --> 00:06:02,710
(Drink jjamppong.)

173
00:06:02,710 --> 00:06:05,250
(And roll the jjajangmyeon.)

174
00:06:05,250 --> 00:06:06,380
(And drink it.)

175
00:06:06,380 --> 00:06:07,880
Stop. Next.

176
00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:09,825
(The description is going nowhere. It's unsalvageable.)

177
00:06:10,620 --> 00:06:12,289
(She makes the same mistake.)

178
00:06:12,289 --> 00:06:14,320
(Half the square.)

179
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:16,504
(She finishes up by drinking the soup.)

180
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:18,234
- Go ahead. - What?

181
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:20,804
This has gotten weird again.

182
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:22,900
I can't memorize this.

183
00:06:22,900 --> 00:06:24,070
(The square is halved.)

184
00:06:24,070 --> 00:06:25,500
(And she drinks it.)

185
00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:27,614
- No, it was weird. - I knew it right away.

186
00:06:27,700 --> 00:06:29,244
All right. Stop it.

187
00:06:29,810 --> 00:06:31,184
Jong Kook, what's the answer?

188
00:06:31,969 --> 00:06:34,614
Hold on. What's wrong with everyone?

189
00:06:34,909 --> 00:06:37,785
- It's a square. Cut it. - You cut it.

190
00:06:38,580 --> 00:06:40,025
But you're drinking a glass all of a sudden.

191
00:06:40,820 --> 00:06:41,924
Then you mix it.

192
00:06:42,419 --> 00:06:44,164
(This round is a dud too.)

193
00:06:44,719 --> 00:06:45,835
Chinese hot pot?

194
00:06:45,919 --> 00:06:48,359
- That's incorrect. - But he got close.

195
00:06:48,359 --> 00:06:49,359
Try to guess from Sunny's descriptions.

196
00:06:49,359 --> 00:06:51,705
- Yes. Try to guess it. - I figured it out right away.

197
00:06:52,190 --> 00:06:53,804
There you go. Yes.

198
00:06:54,529 --> 00:06:55,604
Jjamjjamyeon.

199
00:06:56,669 --> 00:06:58,405
(The answer is jjamjjamyeon.)

200
00:06:58,599 --> 00:07:00,475
I figured it out too!

201
00:07:00,599 --> 00:07:01,900
- Everyone knew it. - Listen.

202
00:07:01,900 --> 00:07:03,609
I thought about saying that as my answer.

203
00:07:03,609 --> 00:07:05,215
I thought it was a watermelon.

204
00:07:05,370 --> 00:07:06,854
- What? - I thought it was a watermelon.

205
00:07:07,109 --> 00:07:09,349
When you have a watermelon, you cut it like this.

206
00:07:09,349 --> 00:07:11,109
- Sunny did a fantastic job. - She's good.

207
00:07:11,109 --> 00:07:12,250
It's not that.

208
00:07:12,250 --> 00:07:13,880
Seok Jin added his own thoughts.

209
00:07:13,880 --> 00:07:15,080
Hey, she ate half of it...

210
00:07:15,080 --> 00:07:17,120
- and drank the juice of the other. - You shouldn't think.

211
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:19,020
You should have done what she exactly did.

212
00:07:19,089 --> 00:07:20,390
Why did you add your ideas?

213
00:07:20,390 --> 00:07:22,659
I did that because I thought it was a watermelon.

214
00:07:22,659 --> 00:07:24,289
- Don't do that. - It might be wrong.

215
00:07:24,289 --> 00:07:25,729
- Something is fishy about you. - Why was it jjamjjamyeon?

216
00:07:25,729 --> 00:07:29,004
All right. You have failed your second mission.

217
00:07:30,029 --> 00:07:32,374
But we could have gotten the second one.

218
00:07:32,469 --> 00:07:33,469
The way she described it was weird.

219
00:07:33,469 --> 00:07:35,339
Had you not added your own ideas...

220
00:07:35,339 --> 00:07:38,145
Hey, it was so obvious. After this, she did this.

221
00:07:38,239 --> 00:07:39,479
Seok Jin seems suspicious.

222
00:07:39,479 --> 00:07:41,539
- No, it's not me. - I like playing games.

223
00:07:41,539 --> 00:07:43,710
It's not me. It's really not me.

224
00:07:43,710 --> 00:07:44,825
(Seok Jin's identity seems more suspicious now.)

225
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:46,549
- Let's do this! - Let's do this!

226
00:07:46,549 --> 00:07:47,695
- Just do what you saw. - Okay.

227
00:07:48,179 --> 00:07:49,250
Don't add your ideas.

228
00:07:49,250 --> 00:07:52,265
All right. I'll make a clean one.

229
00:07:52,419 --> 00:07:55,489
- The category is food. - Food. That's great.

230
00:07:55,489 --> 00:07:57,265
Start.

231
00:07:57,929 --> 00:07:59,830
(Keyword: pickled radish cubes)

232
00:07:59,830 --> 00:08:02,304
(Gosh, you guys are unbelievable.)

233
00:08:02,500 --> 00:08:04,529
I guess something must have gone terribly wrong.

234
00:08:04,529 --> 00:08:06,015
I guess it's a weird keyword.

235
00:08:06,169 --> 00:08:07,814
Ready, set, go.

236
00:08:08,270 --> 00:08:10,469
(He's explaining fried chicken first.)

237
00:08:10,469 --> 00:08:11,510
(Pickled radish cubes)

238
00:08:11,510 --> 00:08:12,984
(Crunchy)

239
00:08:13,739 --> 00:08:15,184
(What's that?)

240
00:08:15,310 --> 00:08:17,650
(The answer is not...)

241
00:08:17,650 --> 00:08:19,219
(fried chicken.)

242
00:08:19,219 --> 00:08:20,825
(It's the pickled radish cube.)

243
00:08:20,979 --> 00:08:22,320
(His 10 seconds to describe it are over.)

244
00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:23,424
Go ahead.

245
00:08:23,650 --> 00:08:24,919
(She must explain this to Kwang Soo now.)

246
00:08:24,919 --> 00:08:26,064
My gosh.

247
00:08:26,489 --> 00:08:28,219
My gosh. That was such a hard one.

248
00:08:28,219 --> 00:08:30,390
(Fried chicken...)

249
00:08:30,390 --> 00:08:31,765
(is not the answer.)

250
00:08:32,260 --> 00:08:33,299
There you go.

251
00:08:33,299 --> 00:08:34,560
(You...)

252
00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:37,270
(dip the fried chicken in this.)

253
00:08:37,270 --> 00:08:40,169
(After describing the mysterious dipping sauce for fried chicken,)

254
00:08:40,169 --> 00:08:42,585
(it's Kwang Soo's turn to describe.)

255
00:08:43,209 --> 00:08:45,185
(Gnawing)

256
00:08:46,610 --> 00:08:49,150
(Kwang Soo is fiercely eating the ribs.)

257
00:08:49,150 --> 00:08:50,179
(The answer is not that.)

258
00:08:50,179 --> 00:08:51,524
That's wrong.

259
00:08:52,449 --> 00:08:53,949
That's wrong, you punk.

260
00:08:53,949 --> 00:08:55,279
(He couldn't help it.)

261
00:08:55,319 --> 00:08:56,624
He's making the whole thing weird.

262
00:08:56,789 --> 00:08:57,994
Come on, Kwang Soo.

263
00:08:58,350 --> 00:09:00,835
(Gnawing on the meat so there's no morsel left)

264
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:03,429
(That's not the answer.)

265
00:09:03,429 --> 00:09:05,264
(It's not?)

266
00:09:05,689 --> 00:09:07,004
There you go.

267
00:09:10,270 --> 00:09:12,175
(Gnawing on the ribs just like he saw)

268
00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:13,975
That's not it?

269
00:09:15,069 --> 00:09:16,809
(The round thing is the answer.)

270
00:09:16,809 --> 00:09:19,140
It looks the same. It's not?

271
00:09:19,140 --> 00:09:20,209
(Confused)

272
00:09:20,209 --> 00:09:21,340
You...

273
00:09:21,340 --> 00:09:22,484
(He's losing it at the round meatball.)

274
00:09:23,079 --> 00:09:24,110
I can't believe this.

275
00:09:24,110 --> 00:09:25,309
(Gnawing on the round food)

276
00:09:25,309 --> 00:09:26,449
(It's not the answer.)

277
00:09:26,449 --> 00:09:28,195
(This is the answer.)

278
00:09:30,189 --> 00:09:31,419
(Her 10 seconds are over.)

279
00:09:31,419 --> 00:09:32,520
What's the answer?

280
00:09:32,520 --> 00:09:35,264
You have to get it right. If you don't, we'll suspect you.

281
00:09:36,130 --> 00:09:37,305
You'll be the deity of darkness.

282
00:09:37,390 --> 00:09:38,529
What is it?

283
00:09:38,590 --> 00:09:39,799
It's not hotteok?

284
00:09:39,860 --> 00:09:41,429
My gosh. Kwang Soo ruined everything.

285
00:09:41,429 --> 00:09:43,475
- Seriously. - Name a dish.

286
00:09:43,669 --> 00:09:45,374
- Four, three, - There aren't that many dishes.

287
00:09:46,069 --> 00:09:47,370
- two, one. - Just say something.

288
00:09:47,370 --> 00:09:48,470
- What's the answer? - Hotteok.

289
00:09:48,470 --> 00:09:49,470
- Hotteok? - Hotteok?

290
00:09:49,470 --> 00:09:51,740
(Her answer is hotteok.)

291
00:09:51,740 --> 00:09:52,939
(That's incorrect.)

292
00:09:52,939 --> 00:09:54,010
The right answer is pickled radish cubes.

293
00:09:54,039 --> 00:09:56,085
But why did you describe pork ribs?

294
00:09:56,179 --> 00:09:57,754
- Hey. - Why did you describe that?

295
00:09:58,110 --> 00:10:00,620
- It was right up to here. - No.

296
00:10:00,620 --> 00:10:02,965
- I took out the fried chicken. - You knew the answer, right?

297
00:10:03,250 --> 00:10:04,620
- No. - You didn't know?

298
00:10:04,689 --> 00:10:06,189
- I didn't know the answer. - It wasn't pork rib?

299
00:10:06,189 --> 00:10:07,319
Why did you do this?

300
00:10:07,319 --> 00:10:08,559
- I thought it was pork ribs. - I thought it was a rib.

301
00:10:08,559 --> 00:10:10,289
- That was wrong. - Don't add your ideas.

302
00:10:10,289 --> 00:10:11,534
I copied her exactly the same.

303
00:10:11,860 --> 00:10:13,504
That was a close one.

304
00:10:13,559 --> 00:10:15,175
So Min, why don't you go first?

305
00:10:15,260 --> 00:10:16,799
- Kwang Soo should answer it. - Kwang Soo, you'll answer it.

306
00:10:16,799 --> 00:10:18,600
- Yes, you should answer it. - Let's get it right this time.

307
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:20,575
- Let's do this. - You keep changing things.

308
00:10:20,900 --> 00:10:22,744
- This time, the category is... - I'm scared.

309
00:10:23,069 --> 00:10:24,384
a place of entertainment.

310
00:10:24,409 --> 00:10:25,439
- Place? - Here we go.

311
00:10:25,439 --> 00:10:26,640
- It's a place. - Place.

312
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:28,140
- Let's do this. - Place.

313
00:10:28,140 --> 00:10:29,380
- I'll get it right. - Place of entertainment.

314
00:10:29,380 --> 00:10:31,384
Here's the keyword.

315
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:33,779
(Keyword: Carousel)

316
00:10:33,779 --> 00:10:35,154
Start.

317
00:10:35,919 --> 00:10:39,049
(You get on the wooden horse and it goes around in a circle.)

318
00:10:39,049 --> 00:10:40,860
(You get on the wooden horse and it goes around in a circle.)

319
00:10:40,860 --> 00:10:43,029
(You get on the wooden horse and it goes around in a circle.)

320
00:10:43,029 --> 00:10:45,205
(The descriptions are exactly the same up to Sun Mi.)

321
00:10:45,329 --> 00:10:46,504
Okay.

322
00:10:46,699 --> 00:10:49,329
(How will Se Chan who seems to have figured out describe it?)

323
00:10:49,329 --> 00:10:50,774
I think he's going to change it.

324
00:10:51,130 --> 00:10:53,374
Come on. That's wrong!

325
00:10:53,740 --> 00:10:55,439
(That's not the carousel. You're horseback riding.)

326
00:10:55,439 --> 00:10:56,840
- When did I do that? - Hey.

327
00:10:56,840 --> 00:10:58,284
That's wrong!

328
00:10:59,480 --> 00:11:00,579
That's wrong!

329
00:11:00,579 --> 00:11:01,640
(It's getting worse.)

330
00:11:01,640 --> 00:11:02,779
(This time, it has become horse racing.)

331
00:11:02,779 --> 00:11:04,250
No!

332
00:11:04,250 --> 00:11:05,654
- What is this? - No.

333
00:11:05,980 --> 00:11:07,195
What's the answer?

334
00:11:07,480 --> 00:11:09,795
- The horse racetrack! - It's wrong?

335
00:11:10,120 --> 00:11:11,425
The answer is carousel.

336
00:11:11,919 --> 00:11:14,189
- Gosh, come on. He's unbelievable. - Wait.

337
00:11:14,189 --> 00:11:16,260
- Didn't I describe that? - He's the culprit.

338
00:11:16,260 --> 00:11:17,659
- I knew it was carousel. - Come on.

339
00:11:17,659 --> 00:11:19,829
We will not provide you the hint...

340
00:11:19,829 --> 00:11:21,159
about the deity of darkness.

341
00:11:21,159 --> 00:11:22,600
(They fail to acquire a hint.)

342
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:24,045
The deity of darkness is here.

343
00:11:24,470 --> 00:11:26,939
- That was so close. - It's definitely one of us.

344
00:11:26,939 --> 00:11:28,299
(Can Se Chan or Kwang Soo be the deity of darkness?)

345
00:11:28,299 --> 00:11:30,539
- We'll start the race now. - Okay.

346
00:11:30,539 --> 00:11:33,014
(They head to the place of the last race with the suspects.)

347
00:11:33,510 --> 00:11:34,709
(They arrive at a place for their last mission.)

348
00:11:34,709 --> 00:11:36,225
My gosh. There's a book.

349
00:11:36,250 --> 00:11:38,884
Actually, you might be able to find some hints here.

350
00:11:38,909 --> 00:11:42,620
"I will depict the deity of darkness in the prophecy in advance."

351
00:11:42,650 --> 00:11:44,120
"Find and eliminate the deity."

352
00:11:44,150 --> 00:11:45,990
- There must be a hint. - I thought so too.

353
00:11:45,990 --> 00:11:47,195
I'm sure of it.

354
00:11:47,459 --> 00:11:49,990
"At some point, the deity began to bother innocent people..."

355
00:11:50,059 --> 00:11:51,335
"and formed an evil group."

356
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:52,390
- Let's take a photo of him. - Why?

357
00:11:52,390 --> 00:11:53,734
- Just in case. - Why are you taking my photo?

358
00:11:54,199 --> 00:11:55,874
- Take your selfie and send it. - Okay.

359
00:11:56,169 --> 00:11:57,774
I didn't know I could do that.

360
00:11:57,900 --> 00:12:00,569
- I took photos of three members. - Suspicious members?

361
00:12:00,569 --> 00:12:02,169
It's a collection of ugly guys.

362
00:12:02,169 --> 00:12:05,370
(No. It's a collection of ugly guys.)

363
00:12:05,439 --> 00:12:07,539
- You should take a selfie. - You should take a selfie.

364
00:12:07,539 --> 00:12:08,815
Everyone should a selfie.

365
00:12:08,840 --> 00:12:09,909
Take a selfie.

366
00:12:09,909 --> 00:12:11,549
- I collect these kinds of photos. - Is that so?

367
00:12:11,549 --> 00:12:12,850
Yes. I have a collection of ugly guys.

368
00:12:12,850 --> 00:12:14,250
I'm curious about that.

369
00:12:14,250 --> 00:12:16,264
- You should hold an exhibit. - I will.

370
00:12:16,319 --> 00:12:17,549
I'll tell you the rules.

371
00:12:17,549 --> 00:12:20,260
Protect the deity of light. And Eliminate the deity of darkness.

372
00:12:20,260 --> 00:12:22,534
It's War of Black and White: Protect the Light.

373
00:12:22,860 --> 00:12:24,189
Throughout the building,

374
00:12:24,189 --> 00:12:25,559
- there are hints about the prophet, - This is hard.

375
00:12:25,559 --> 00:12:27,575
the deity of light, and deity of darkness.

376
00:12:27,929 --> 00:12:29,929
After an hour, a platform that will reveal the identities...

377
00:12:29,929 --> 00:12:31,545
will be open to you.

378
00:12:32,270 --> 00:12:34,744
Only the deity of darkness should go up on the platform.

379
00:12:34,770 --> 00:12:36,169
If the deity of darkness is on the platform,

380
00:12:36,169 --> 00:12:37,644
humans and the deity of light will win.

381
00:12:37,709 --> 00:12:39,209
If a human or the deity of light goes on the platform,

382
00:12:39,209 --> 00:12:41,014
the deity of darkness will win the race by him or herself.

383
00:12:41,079 --> 00:12:42,439
However, before the platform is open...

384
00:12:42,439 --> 00:12:45,150
if one of the deities gets eliminated, the race will be over.

385
00:12:45,150 --> 00:12:46,394
It will be over?

386
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:48,850
But if the prophet gets eliminated, you won't get any more hints...

387
00:12:48,850 --> 00:12:51,350
and won't have a way to figure out who the deity of darkness is.

388
00:12:51,350 --> 00:12:53,260
- We must be careful. - We must figure out who that is.

389
00:12:53,260 --> 00:12:54,559
We must protect the prophet.

390
00:12:54,559 --> 00:12:55,559
It's complicated.

391
00:12:55,559 --> 00:12:56,730
- Gosh. - This is hard.

392
00:12:56,730 --> 00:12:59,374
And somewhere in the building, a special temple stands.

393
00:12:59,529 --> 00:13:02,435
At a specific time, the temple will open twice.

394
00:13:02,669 --> 00:13:04,270
Two members who have found the Temple Summons...

395
00:13:04,270 --> 00:13:07,114
can select a member each and enter the temple with them.

396
00:13:07,140 --> 00:13:09,640
When all of the four members put their hands on the platform,

397
00:13:09,640 --> 00:13:12,010
depending on the presences of the deities and the prophet,

398
00:13:12,010 --> 00:13:15,055
the color will change accordingly.

399
00:13:15,079 --> 00:13:18,650
You'll head to the place where your last race will be held.

400
00:13:18,650 --> 00:13:20,620
(Which team will win the final race?)

401
00:13:20,620 --> 00:13:21,754
- Okay. - Let's go!

402
00:13:22,250 --> 00:13:24,864
(Kwang Soo is always the most suspicious member.)

403
00:13:24,919 --> 00:13:27,689
(He checks the hint he won in the previous mission.)

404
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:30,134
I don't get this one. The photo means the opposite.

405
00:13:31,260 --> 00:13:34,205
(There's a white swan, but the title is "Black Swan".)

406
00:13:34,230 --> 00:13:35,705
Is there a secret behind the photo?

407
00:13:37,470 --> 00:13:39,740
Really? Is there a hint in the photo?

408
00:13:39,740 --> 00:13:40,975
(So Min told him about the back of the hint card.)

409
00:13:41,370 --> 00:13:43,039
(He checks the back of the hint card.)

410
00:13:43,039 --> 00:13:44,215
"White Cat".

411
00:13:44,740 --> 00:13:47,179
(It says "White Cat", but it's a photo of a black cat.)

412
00:13:47,179 --> 00:13:49,455
It's a black cat, but it says it's a white cat here.

413
00:13:50,709 --> 00:13:52,350
I don't get the back of the hint card.

414
00:13:52,350 --> 00:13:54,419
What does the photo mean? It's the opposite of the title.

415
00:13:54,419 --> 00:13:55,555
(So Min doesn't know what it means either.)

416
00:13:55,880 --> 00:13:57,590
(He realized something.)

417
00:13:57,590 --> 00:13:59,360
(Did Se Chan figure out the meaning behind it?)

418
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:00,490
You know...

419
00:14:00,490 --> 00:14:02,490
This isn't the black swan we think of.

420
00:14:02,490 --> 00:14:04,860
It should say it's white, but it says black. It's the opposite.

421
00:14:04,860 --> 00:14:06,175
So Min told me about this.

422
00:14:06,559 --> 00:14:07,805
Sunny...

423
00:14:08,299 --> 00:14:09,500
S-U-N.

424
00:14:09,500 --> 00:14:11,305
She can be the deity of light.

425
00:14:11,500 --> 00:14:13,140
But the opposite of that is darkness.

426
00:14:13,140 --> 00:14:14,240
(Is Sunny the deity of light?)

427
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:17,915
I thought that it could be Sunny when we first started.

428
00:14:18,010 --> 00:14:19,380
But Haha...

429
00:14:19,380 --> 00:14:21,010
(But Sunny suspects Haha.)

430
00:14:21,010 --> 00:14:22,884
He's not the deity of darkness, right?

431
00:14:23,610 --> 00:14:25,250
Jae Seok seems a bit suspicious too.

432
00:14:25,250 --> 00:14:26,319
(Their suspicion goes in a circle.)

433
00:14:26,319 --> 00:14:27,524
Jae Seok...

434
00:14:28,079 --> 00:14:30,250
(Everyone keeps suspecting each other.)

435
00:14:30,250 --> 00:14:31,919
4, 3...

436
00:14:31,919 --> 00:14:34,189
(Can they solve the secret and find the deity of darkness?)

437
00:14:34,189 --> 00:14:35,565
Deity of darkness.

438
00:14:35,959 --> 00:14:36,990
Go away!

439
00:14:36,990 --> 00:14:38,289
The race starts.

440
00:14:38,289 --> 00:14:39,400
(The race starts.)

441
00:14:39,400 --> 00:14:41,299
Jae Seok, I thought about who it could be.

442
00:14:41,299 --> 00:14:43,144
- What is it? - The deity of darkness...

443
00:14:43,429 --> 00:14:46,345
can't be Seok Jin or Jang Ye Won.

444
00:14:47,100 --> 00:14:49,470
But the deity of darkness likely took the other bus.

445
00:14:49,470 --> 00:14:51,069
(It's likely the deity got on the bus with the deity of light.)

446
00:14:51,069 --> 00:14:52,244
With that said,

447
00:14:53,179 --> 00:14:55,480
the chances of Haha and Jang Ye Won's winning are low,

448
00:14:55,480 --> 00:14:57,154
but they did their best to win...

449
00:14:57,610 --> 00:15:00,894
because one of them might be the deity of darkness.

450
00:15:00,919 --> 00:15:02,419
- No. - What?

451
00:15:02,419 --> 00:15:03,620
(He sounds firm.)

452
00:15:03,620 --> 00:15:04,850
(What?)

453
00:15:04,850 --> 00:15:06,024
Are you serious? How could you...

454
00:15:06,419 --> 00:15:08,860
I'm sharing my secret with you after thinking about it.

455
00:15:08,860 --> 00:15:09,929
Go on.

456
00:15:09,990 --> 00:15:11,029
But...

457
00:15:11,029 --> 00:15:13,835
I got a hint that Jang Ye Won couldn't be the deity of darkness.

458
00:15:14,230 --> 00:15:15,935
- Right. - That leaves...

459
00:15:16,059 --> 00:15:18,470
- Haha. - It's highly likely that it's Haha.

460
00:15:18,470 --> 00:15:19,545
(This is Kwang Soo's speculation.)

461
00:15:20,470 --> 00:15:21,970
Your detective skill is very elementary.

462
00:15:21,970 --> 00:15:24,840
(After giving it some thought...)

463
00:15:24,840 --> 00:15:26,815
(I can't believe him.)

464
00:15:27,010 --> 00:15:28,685
You're at the first level.

465
00:15:29,449 --> 00:15:30,754
Think harder on it. Okay?

466
00:15:31,079 --> 00:15:32,425
I think you're a human,

467
00:15:32,779 --> 00:15:34,994
but you can walk around and face the penalty later.

468
00:15:37,289 --> 00:15:38,449
Can I wear this?

469
00:15:38,449 --> 00:15:39,689
(Sunny is looking for hints.)

470
00:15:39,689 --> 00:15:41,494
(What?)

471
00:15:41,919 --> 00:15:44,260
(It was hidden inside the prop box for a drama.)

472
00:15:44,260 --> 00:15:46,374
(She's the first one to find a hint.)

473
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:50,029
(The youngest member of Running Man is not the prophet.)

474
00:15:50,029 --> 00:15:51,270
(What?)

475
00:15:51,270 --> 00:15:52,600
(Prophet, Deity of Darkness, Deity of Light)

476
00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:55,475
(This doesn't apply to Yang Se Chan.)

477
00:15:55,799 --> 00:15:58,585
I'm really surprised right now. Is Se Chan the youngest here?

478
00:15:59,909 --> 00:16:01,209
(The youngest, Se Chan, faces a defeat.)

479
00:16:01,209 --> 00:16:02,955
- So Min wasn't the youngest. - No.

480
00:16:03,480 --> 00:16:04,725
He was born in December.

481
00:16:04,809 --> 00:16:06,124
My goodness.

482
00:16:06,380 --> 00:16:08,555
My gosh, what happened to Se Chan?

483
00:16:09,449 --> 00:16:10,764
There are no hints.

484
00:16:12,120 --> 00:16:13,559
(What?)

485
00:16:13,559 --> 00:16:15,665
(He quickly runs toward something.)

486
00:16:15,919 --> 00:16:18,234
(Jae Seok has spotted...)

487
00:16:18,789 --> 00:16:19,929
There are two.

488
00:16:19,929 --> 00:16:22,329
(Hint envelope)

489
00:16:22,329 --> 00:16:24,945
(Empty hint envelope)

490
00:16:25,270 --> 00:16:26,374
My gosh, someone already...

491
00:16:26,900 --> 00:16:28,939
(The second envelope is empty as well.)

492
00:16:28,939 --> 00:16:30,939
(Sighing)

493
00:16:31,010 --> 00:16:32,069
This is so upsetting.

494
00:16:32,069 --> 00:16:33,284
(This is so upsetting.)

495
00:16:34,779 --> 00:16:35,880
(Meanwhile, So Min was passing by at that time.)

496
00:16:35,880 --> 00:16:37,024
(Knock, knock)

497
00:16:37,779 --> 00:16:39,354
(Knocking)

498
00:16:40,650 --> 00:16:41,679
(It's Jae Seok.)

499
00:16:41,679 --> 00:16:43,325
(Doing her cute act)

500
00:16:44,250 --> 00:16:45,350
(Puffing her cheeks)

501
00:16:45,350 --> 00:16:47,435
Stop it. Stop doing that.

502
00:16:47,789 --> 00:16:49,665
(Aren't I cute?)

503
00:16:49,689 --> 00:16:51,390
So Min. Hold on. She's...

504
00:16:51,390 --> 00:16:53,134
(As soon as she disappears, he starts suspecting her.)

505
00:16:53,559 --> 00:16:56,100
There's Jae Seok. He can be the deity of darkness too.

506
00:16:56,100 --> 00:16:57,400
(So Min suspects him too.)

507
00:16:57,400 --> 00:16:58,470
So Min.

508
00:16:58,470 --> 00:17:00,539
(So Min heads somewhere as soon as she enters.)

509
00:17:00,539 --> 00:17:02,215
(What's this?)

510
00:17:02,669 --> 00:17:04,370
(These are empty.)

511
00:17:04,370 --> 00:17:06,614
- They are empty. - Someone already took them.

512
00:17:07,679 --> 00:17:09,610
(She rips a page from her notebook.)

513
00:17:09,610 --> 00:17:12,784
(She starts writing something down.)

514
00:17:13,620 --> 00:17:15,794
Why would you write, "You're a fool" and put it in there?

515
00:17:16,179 --> 00:17:18,790
(I got you! Silly you.)

516
00:17:18,790 --> 00:17:20,794
I want someone to read it and be annoyed by this.

517
00:17:21,060 --> 00:17:22,135
It's hard, you know.

518
00:17:22,459 --> 00:17:23,764
Gosh, So Min.

519
00:17:24,689 --> 00:17:25,905
Did you find anything?

520
00:17:26,429 --> 00:17:28,675
To me, you're one of the candidates for the deity of darkness.

521
00:17:28,929 --> 00:17:30,070
- So Min. - Yes?

522
00:17:30,070 --> 00:17:31,929
(Speaking in a low voice)

523
00:17:31,929 --> 00:17:33,074
I'm glad you brought it up.

524
00:17:34,370 --> 00:17:35,744
What are you doing?

525
00:17:36,540 --> 00:17:38,685
(Trembling in fear)

526
00:17:38,969 --> 00:17:40,215
I'm...

527
00:17:40,709 --> 00:17:41,885
the deity of darkness.

528
00:17:42,040 --> 00:17:43,179
What are you talking about?

529
00:17:43,179 --> 00:17:44,284
(Glancing)

530
00:17:44,509 --> 00:17:45,610
(You're the deity of darkness?)

531
00:17:45,610 --> 00:17:46,979
- Really? That's not true. - Yes.

532
00:17:46,979 --> 00:17:48,150
I'm the deity of darkness.

533
00:17:48,150 --> 00:17:49,689
No, you're not. Why are you doing this to me?

534
00:17:49,689 --> 00:17:51,465
- Really? Are you? - Yes.

535
00:17:51,489 --> 00:17:53,659
Seriously? Are you really the deity of darkness?

536
00:17:53,659 --> 00:17:55,395
- Are you serious? - I told you.

537
00:17:55,790 --> 00:17:56,830
I told you.

538
00:17:56,890 --> 00:17:58,834
I told you I'm the deity of darkness.

539
00:17:59,489 --> 00:18:00,959
- All of a sudden? - Be quiet.

540
00:18:01,030 --> 00:18:02,130
Spare me.

541
00:18:02,199 --> 00:18:04,530
Spare me just this once. I won't tell anyone. Spare me.

542
00:18:04,530 --> 00:18:06,044
Can you really keep it a secret?

543
00:18:06,100 --> 00:18:08,115
- Are you really the deity? - I'll spare you if you can.

544
00:18:08,370 --> 00:18:11,084
Right now, I have to go look for the deity of light.

545
00:18:11,909 --> 00:18:13,979
Don't lie down there. Don't do that.

546
00:18:13,979 --> 00:18:15,415
(Let me show you another cute act.)

547
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:18,080
(She flails to survive.)

548
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:19,185
Get up.

549
00:18:19,580 --> 00:18:21,179
- Jae Seok. You'll tell me... - Yes?

550
00:18:21,179 --> 00:18:22,695
- get up and rip it off, right? - No.

551
00:18:24,120 --> 00:18:25,890
(Jae Seok leaves her without a fuss.)

552
00:18:25,890 --> 00:18:27,019
My gosh.

553
00:18:27,019 --> 00:18:29,590
(He told her that he's the deity of darkness.)

554
00:18:29,590 --> 00:18:32,665
(Was he telling the truth?)

555
00:18:32,929 --> 00:18:34,060
What is this?

556
00:18:34,060 --> 00:18:35,405
(Meanwhile, Jong Kook has been looking for hints.)

557
00:18:36,429 --> 00:18:38,630
(He finds So Min's empty envelope.)

558
00:18:38,630 --> 00:18:39,939
They already opened it.

559
00:18:39,969 --> 00:18:41,375
"I got you! Silly you."

560
00:18:41,900 --> 00:18:43,284
Doesn't it look like Ji Hyo's handwriting?

561
00:18:44,110 --> 00:18:46,115
(It's me, So Min. You were duped once again.)

562
00:18:47,380 --> 00:18:49,949
(Ji Hyo finds So Min's envelope too.)

563
00:18:49,949 --> 00:18:52,455
(You were duped, Ji Hyo.)

564
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:54,324
What?

565
00:18:55,150 --> 00:18:58,365
(She spots a suspicious-looking picture.)

566
00:19:00,159 --> 00:19:03,034
("Broad Daylight")

567
00:19:03,090 --> 00:19:05,865
Why is there a moon when it's called "Broad Daylight"?

568
00:19:07,830 --> 00:19:11,175
(The picture shows the opposite of its name.)

569
00:19:11,929 --> 00:19:14,274
(There are more.)

570
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:18,709
(It's called "Dark Clouds", but it shows white clouds.)

571
00:19:18,709 --> 00:19:20,215
What does this mean?

572
00:19:21,179 --> 00:19:22,814
(They all find mysterious pictures.)

573
00:19:23,179 --> 00:19:25,050
"White Cat"?

574
00:19:25,050 --> 00:19:26,125
(Unlike its name, it's a picture of a black cat.)

575
00:19:26,719 --> 00:19:28,695
(They've found a total of 4 pictures so far.)

576
00:19:29,219 --> 00:19:30,689
"Blue Sea in Daylight"?

577
00:19:30,689 --> 00:19:31,865
(Unlike its name, it's a picture of a dark sea.)

578
00:19:32,749 --> 00:19:35,465
(What do these pictures mean?)

579
00:19:36,019 --> 00:19:37,429
All the pictures show the opposite of their names.

580
00:19:37,429 --> 00:19:39,530
Exactly. But I don't know what they mean.

581
00:19:39,530 --> 00:19:42,830
Perhaps, the hints that we got mean the opposite.

582
00:19:42,830 --> 00:19:43,830
Right.

583
00:19:43,830 --> 00:19:46,030
I suspected that too, but why was that necessary?

584
00:19:46,030 --> 00:19:48,574
(Could the hints mean the opposite as well?)

585
00:19:48,739 --> 00:19:51,209
It's called "Broad Daylight".

586
00:19:51,239 --> 00:19:54,080
- But is it dark? - But there's a dark moon.

587
00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:56,949
So I suspect that the deity of darkness...

588
00:19:56,949 --> 00:19:59,554
and that of light are the same person.

589
00:20:00,620 --> 00:20:02,419
Sun Mi is the deity of light.

590
00:20:02,419 --> 00:20:03,965
(Blurting)

591
00:20:04,689 --> 00:20:06,050
No, she isn't.

592
00:20:06,050 --> 00:20:08,060
No, listen.

593
00:20:08,060 --> 00:20:10,860
I got a hint that said she wasn't.

594
00:20:10,860 --> 00:20:14,630
But the pictures and their names mean the opposite.

595
00:20:14,630 --> 00:20:16,400
The hint said that the deity of light...

596
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:17,699
wasn't in their 20s.

597
00:20:17,699 --> 00:20:20,175
That's why Sun Mi was the sole exception.

598
00:20:20,199 --> 00:20:22,140
But if we think oppositely,

599
00:20:22,140 --> 00:20:23,840
the deity of light is Sun Mi.

600
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:25,540
(She's very simpleminded.)

601
00:20:25,540 --> 00:20:27,955
Ye Won, I thought you were smart.

602
00:20:28,509 --> 00:20:30,110
I get that.

603
00:20:30,110 --> 00:20:33,009
But if that's the case, we'd know the truth too easily.

604
00:20:33,009 --> 00:20:34,780
So this is what I think.

605
00:20:34,780 --> 00:20:36,689
The hint said the deity of light...

606
00:20:36,689 --> 00:20:39,264
- Goodness. - wasn't in their 20s.

607
00:20:39,320 --> 00:20:41,935
But perhaps, that could be about the deity of darkness.

608
00:20:41,989 --> 00:20:43,860
It could've been a hint about the deity of darkness.

609
00:20:43,860 --> 00:20:45,560
(The deity of light isn't in their 20s.)

610
00:20:45,560 --> 00:20:48,975
(Could the hint be talking about the deity of darkness?)

611
00:20:49,229 --> 00:20:50,870
It's a picture of a black cat, but it's called "White Cat".

612
00:20:50,870 --> 00:20:53,105
It's the opposite.

613
00:20:54,140 --> 00:20:57,140
I think the hints for the deities of light and darkness have switched.

614
00:20:57,140 --> 00:20:59,544
(She's positive.)

615
00:21:00,610 --> 00:21:02,540
Soon, all the humans and the deity of light...

616
00:21:02,540 --> 00:21:04,880
will gather together to check the prophecy.

617
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:05,909
In this prophecy,

618
00:21:05,909 --> 00:21:07,850
there's a hint about the deity of light and an order...

619
00:21:07,850 --> 00:21:10,189
to get rid of you, the deity of darkness.

620
00:21:10,189 --> 00:21:13,395
If you chant the spell in order to make a fake prophecy,

621
00:21:13,519 --> 00:21:15,519
all the "deity of light" in the prophecy...

622
00:21:15,519 --> 00:21:17,530
will turn into "deity of darkness".

623
00:21:17,530 --> 00:21:19,360
Once the humans read this, they will believe...

624
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:21,159
that the deity of light is actually the deity of darkness...

625
00:21:21,159 --> 00:21:23,905
and will try to eliminate that deity.

626
00:21:25,269 --> 00:21:27,469
(The hints will be changed as well.)

627
00:21:27,469 --> 00:21:29,340
It's the same for the hints as well.

628
00:21:29,340 --> 00:21:32,284
The hints will be switched.

629
00:21:32,870 --> 00:21:35,739
The hints regarding the deity of light will be...

630
00:21:35,739 --> 00:21:38,984
about the deity of darkness, and vice versa.

631
00:21:39,610 --> 00:21:42,395
Are these hints fake?

632
00:21:42,979 --> 00:21:44,120
- I think the hints are... - I think...

633
00:21:44,120 --> 00:21:46,564
the hints for the two deities have switched.

634
00:21:46,620 --> 00:21:49,064
- It's the opposite. - Right.

635
00:21:49,560 --> 00:21:51,030
- So... - It's so weird.

636
00:21:51,030 --> 00:21:52,290
I think I get it.

637
00:21:52,290 --> 00:21:54,300
- Why isn't she talking much? - Look at the pictures.

638
00:21:54,300 --> 00:21:55,605
The pictures?

639
00:21:55,729 --> 00:21:57,370
- What do you mean? - Look at the hints.

640
00:21:57,370 --> 00:21:59,100
(So Min starts to tell the others about this secret.)

641
00:21:59,100 --> 00:22:02,040
It's the opposite. The hints regarding...

642
00:22:02,040 --> 00:22:04,514
the two deities have switched.

643
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:06,140
If you think like that...

644
00:22:06,140 --> 00:22:07,385
(Dashing)

645
00:22:07,679 --> 00:22:09,484
(Who is running?)

646
00:22:10,150 --> 00:22:11,550
(Ripping)

647
00:22:11,550 --> 00:22:13,524
(So Min is out.)

648
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:18,125
So Min, a human, is out.

649
00:22:18,219 --> 00:22:19,994
She's out?

650
00:22:20,159 --> 00:22:21,594
No way.

651
00:22:22,219 --> 00:22:23,334
Who did it?

652
00:22:24,030 --> 00:22:25,989
- I just saw her. - No way.

653
00:22:25,989 --> 00:22:27,534
- She went over there. - Really?

654
00:22:27,959 --> 00:22:30,330
She went that way? That's where she was attacked.

655
00:22:30,330 --> 00:22:31,945
And there...

656
00:22:32,469 --> 00:22:33,574
Who was there?

657
00:22:34,300 --> 00:22:35,769
Who was there?

658
00:22:35,769 --> 00:22:37,209
(Who was in that area?)

659
00:22:37,209 --> 00:22:39,169
I saw Se Chan there.

660
00:22:39,169 --> 00:22:40,610
- Se Chan? - So Min went over there,

661
00:22:40,610 --> 00:22:42,115
and he was there.

662
00:22:42,580 --> 00:22:45,524
- But I just saw her. - Really?

663
00:22:46,080 --> 00:22:48,794
(Is Se Chan the one who eliminated her?)

664
00:22:49,350 --> 00:22:51,965
I think Se Chan is the deity of darkness.

665
00:22:52,949 --> 00:22:54,259
(Thanks to Kwang Soo, everyone is suspecting Se Chan.)

666
00:22:54,259 --> 00:22:55,594
Hold on, Kwang Soo.

667
00:22:56,090 --> 00:22:57,530
(He suspects something.)

668
00:22:57,530 --> 00:22:59,259
Why is a moving camera shooting you?

669
00:22:59,259 --> 00:23:01,504
(Why is a moving camera shooting you?)

670
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:03,030
(It's a customized camera just for him.)

671
00:23:03,030 --> 00:23:04,544
When did you come here?

672
00:23:04,699 --> 00:23:06,499
- I mean... - He keeps following me.

673
00:23:06,499 --> 00:23:08,070
When did you come?

674
00:23:08,070 --> 00:23:09,499
You're too suspicious to hang around with.

675
00:23:09,499 --> 00:23:11,110
Can I not have a moving camera with me?

676
00:23:11,110 --> 00:23:13,580
- I mean... - I'm 35 years old.

677
00:23:13,580 --> 00:23:16,709
Come on. Why are you acting so suspiciously since last week?

678
00:23:16,709 --> 00:23:18,110
Don't be suspicious of things like this.

679
00:23:18,110 --> 00:23:19,509
- I'm not. - What was I last week?

680
00:23:19,509 --> 00:23:21,080
You were a citizen.

681
00:23:21,080 --> 00:23:22,254
And who was the bad guy?

682
00:23:22,919 --> 00:23:24,790
- I'm sorry. - It was you.

683
00:23:24,790 --> 00:23:25,965
(He slaps Se Chan.)

684
00:23:26,550 --> 00:23:27,790
- I'm sorry. - Right?

685
00:23:27,790 --> 00:23:28,890
You were just...

686
00:23:28,890 --> 00:23:30,030
I didn't realize this while watching it...

687
00:23:30,030 --> 00:23:31,935
but come to think of it, it's infuriating.

688
00:23:32,060 --> 00:23:34,475
All right. You can go for now.

689
00:23:34,659 --> 00:23:38,344
But be careful. These could all serve as hints.

690
00:23:38,469 --> 00:23:39,830
Let's find more hints.

691
00:23:39,830 --> 00:23:41,145
Yes, let's do that.

692
00:23:41,800 --> 00:23:43,984
This is what I think.

693
00:23:44,310 --> 00:23:45,409
Everyone, freeze.

694
00:23:45,409 --> 00:23:47,655
The temple's door has opened.

695
00:23:47,780 --> 00:23:49,810
The temple's door has opened.

696
00:23:49,810 --> 00:23:51,209
(Finally, the door has opened.)

697
00:23:51,209 --> 00:23:52,355
The temple's door has opened?

698
00:23:53,050 --> 00:23:56,419
Se Chan, you were summoned.

699
00:23:56,419 --> 00:23:58,219
You must go to the temple.

700
00:23:58,219 --> 00:23:59,425
Who summoned me?

701
00:23:59,590 --> 00:24:01,234
You should go there first.

702
00:24:01,790 --> 00:24:03,630
(Unknowing who did it, he heads for the temple.)

703
00:24:03,630 --> 00:24:05,705
He's being summoned since he's suspicious, right?

704
00:24:05,860 --> 00:24:07,635
I'm an innocent citizen.

705
00:24:08,259 --> 00:24:09,504
I don't believe you.

706
00:24:09,900 --> 00:24:11,445
They summoned me?

707
00:24:12,130 --> 00:24:13,445
I wonder who it is.

708
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:16,600
(Sun Mi was the one.)

709
00:24:16,600 --> 00:24:18,615
No way.

710
00:24:19,739 --> 00:24:20,915
What is this?

711
00:24:21,780 --> 00:24:22,909
What was this again?

712
00:24:22,909 --> 00:24:25,150
(Temple Summons)

713
00:24:25,150 --> 00:24:26,225
I'd like to summon...

714
00:24:27,080 --> 00:24:28,280
Se Chan.

715
00:24:28,280 --> 00:24:29,395
(She summoned the suspicious Se Chan.)

716
00:24:30,850 --> 00:24:32,290
(Suddenly)

717
00:24:32,290 --> 00:24:33,465
Seok Jin?

718
00:24:33,519 --> 00:24:34,790
Did you get a Temple Summons?

719
00:24:34,790 --> 00:24:36,189
- What? - Did you get a Temple Summons?

720
00:24:36,189 --> 00:24:37,929
- What about you? - I have one.

721
00:24:37,929 --> 00:24:39,205
(Seok Jin is the second one to show up.)

722
00:24:39,830 --> 00:24:42,729
(While searching for more hints,)

723
00:24:42,729 --> 00:24:43,999
Okay, okay.

724
00:24:43,999 --> 00:24:45,475
(he found a Temple Summons as well.)

725
00:24:45,969 --> 00:24:47,140
Did you summon me?

726
00:24:47,140 --> 00:24:48,274
No, I didn't.

727
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:49,540
Then whom did you summon?

728
00:24:49,540 --> 00:24:51,685
I'm about to. I'm still thinking.

729
00:24:51,739 --> 00:24:53,284
- Whom will you pick? - I'll...

730
00:24:53,709 --> 00:24:54,784
I'll summon...

731
00:24:55,110 --> 00:24:56,780
Jae Seok.

732
00:24:56,780 --> 00:24:58,209
(Seok Jin summons Jae Seok.)

733
00:24:58,209 --> 00:24:59,455
Why him?

734
00:24:59,709 --> 00:25:00,820
Why?

735
00:25:00,820 --> 00:25:02,550
(He's been suspecting him for a long time.)

736
00:25:02,550 --> 00:25:03,965
We need to get him in here.

737
00:25:04,050 --> 00:25:05,519
Jae Seok, you've been summoned.

738
00:25:05,519 --> 00:25:06,764
Me?

739
00:25:06,890 --> 00:25:08,320
I'll be back. Remember how I was summoned last time...

740
00:25:08,320 --> 00:25:09,459
and found out who it was?

741
00:25:09,459 --> 00:25:11,989
Just wait. Let me stop by the temple.

742
00:25:11,989 --> 00:25:12,989
(Instead of being flustered,)

743
00:25:12,989 --> 00:25:15,830
(he bravely walks towards the temple.)

744
00:25:15,830 --> 00:25:17,744
I wondered who summoned me.

745
00:25:17,870 --> 00:25:20,199
I summoned you because you seemed suspicious.

746
00:25:20,199 --> 00:25:22,640
You're very suspicious.

747
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:24,185
- Let's do this. - All right.

748
00:25:25,269 --> 00:25:27,140
(The color on the monitor will change...)

749
00:25:27,140 --> 00:25:29,009
(according to the presence of the two deities and the prophet.)

750
00:25:29,009 --> 00:25:30,780
I'm sure there's one here.

751
00:25:30,780 --> 00:25:32,209
- Do you think so? - Yes.

752
00:25:32,209 --> 00:25:33,850
On the count of three,

753
00:25:33,850 --> 00:25:36,824
the monitor behind you will show a color.

754
00:25:37,820 --> 00:25:38,850
One...

755
00:25:38,850 --> 00:25:42,820
(Will any of them be 1 of the 3 key characters?)

756
00:25:42,820 --> 00:25:44,429
(Which color among the 8 given will show?)

757
00:25:44,429 --> 00:25:46,534
- 2, 3! - 2, 3!

758
00:25:46,634 --> 00:25:49,634
<font color="#fcc89b">[VIU Ver] SBS E467 Running Man</font> <font color="#ff80ff">"The Deity of Light, The Deity of Darkness & The Prophet Part 2"</font> <font color="#ff5fa2">-♥ Ruo Xi ♥-</font>

759
00:25:49,800 --> 00:25:52,699
(Surprised)

760
00:25:52,699 --> 00:25:54,544
(That can't be!)

761
00:25:54,699 --> 00:25:57,739
(What is the result of the first visit to the temple?)

762
00:25:57,739 --> 00:25:59,239
(It's white.)

763
00:25:59,239 --> 00:26:00,780
- What is that? White? - No way!

764
00:26:00,780 --> 00:26:02,140
(That means all 4 of them are human.)

765
00:26:02,140 --> 00:26:04,650
(All human, white)

766
00:26:04,650 --> 00:26:06,350
- We're all human? - It's So Min.

767
00:26:06,350 --> 00:26:07,880
- Seriously? - It's So Min.

768
00:26:07,880 --> 00:26:09,679
- I'm sorry. - This is why I summoned him.

769
00:26:09,679 --> 00:26:11,489
- I'm sorry. - Why did you...

770
00:26:11,489 --> 00:26:13,125
- Hey. - suspect me?

771
00:26:13,219 --> 00:26:15,635
Hey, we should trust each other.

772
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:20,060
(Prophet Candidates, Deity of Darkness Candidates,)

773
00:26:20,060 --> 00:26:22,935
(Deity of Light Candidates)

774
00:26:24,169 --> 00:26:27,175
Not the deity of darkness means not the deity of light.

775
00:26:27,699 --> 00:26:30,814
(Ye Won uses her brain as an announcer.)

776
00:26:31,370 --> 00:26:35,014
(She's trying to zero in on the deity of darkness.)

777
00:26:35,679 --> 00:26:38,554
(Who could it be?)

778
00:26:39,280 --> 00:26:40,494
- Let's look at it together. - Let me look first.

779
00:26:40,650 --> 00:26:42,479
Let me check it first.

780
00:26:42,479 --> 00:26:44,719
- Hold on. - We're one.

781
00:26:44,719 --> 00:26:46,650
- This isn't how you do it. - We're one.

782
00:26:46,650 --> 00:26:48,659
- No, we're not. - Yes, we are.

783
00:26:48,659 --> 00:26:50,659
- I have the right to show you. - It's done for.

784
00:26:50,659 --> 00:26:52,665
You can't steal it away from me.

785
00:26:53,259 --> 00:26:55,199
(The deity of light doesn't have a "K" in their surname.)

786
00:26:55,199 --> 00:26:57,130
(Kim Jong Kook and Kim Ye Won are excluded.)

787
00:26:57,130 --> 00:26:58,400
(Deity of Darkness)

788
00:26:58,400 --> 00:27:02,415
(Deity of Darkness Candidates)

789
00:27:02,939 --> 00:27:04,040
The deity of darkness...

790
00:27:04,040 --> 00:27:06,070
(The candidates are Haha, Ji Hyo, Kwang Soo, or Sunny.)

791
00:27:06,070 --> 00:27:07,509
is either Kwang Soo...

792
00:27:07,509 --> 00:27:09,209
(Her sixth sense is tingling.)

793
00:27:09,209 --> 00:27:10,455
or Sunny.

794
00:27:11,610 --> 00:27:14,925
(Did Ye Won guess it correctly?)

795
00:27:16,479 --> 00:27:17,519
(The 4 humans exit the temple.)

796
00:27:17,519 --> 00:27:18,749
Are you going this way?

797
00:27:18,749 --> 00:27:19,949
- Yes. - You should've summoned her.

798
00:27:19,949 --> 00:27:23,120
- Don't rip my name tag. - Come here. You're in trouble.

799
00:27:23,120 --> 00:27:25,560
The hint said that Ye Won wasn't the prophet.

800
00:27:25,560 --> 00:27:27,435
- Her? She isn't the prophet. - Yes.

801
00:27:27,999 --> 00:27:29,259
She's not the deity of darkness either.

802
00:27:29,259 --> 00:27:30,645
- Are you all human? - Yes.

803
00:27:31,429 --> 00:27:32,729
We're all human.

804
00:27:32,729 --> 00:27:34,269
- What about Jae Seok? - He's human too.

805
00:27:34,269 --> 00:27:36,340
Are you sure? I found a lead on the deity of darkness.

806
00:27:36,340 --> 00:27:38,810
- What is it? - I found a lead.

807
00:27:38,810 --> 00:27:40,979
It's either Sunny or Kwang Soo.

808
00:27:40,979 --> 00:27:43,380
(She thinks it's 1 of those 2.)

809
00:27:43,380 --> 00:27:45,449
- Kwang Soo? - It's one of them.

810
00:27:45,449 --> 00:27:47,794
- Are you serious? - Sunny or Kwang Soo?

811
00:27:48,050 --> 00:27:49,855
- Are you certain? - Yes.

812
00:27:50,419 --> 00:27:51,949
I think she's right.

813
00:27:51,949 --> 00:27:53,590
Here comes the deity of darkness!

814
00:27:53,590 --> 00:27:55,259
(Look over there!)

815
00:27:55,259 --> 00:27:57,465
(At that moment, Kwang Soo approaches.)

816
00:27:58,130 --> 00:27:59,689
- Me? Why? - Yes.

817
00:27:59,689 --> 00:28:01,429
- Why? - I think it's you.

818
00:28:01,429 --> 00:28:02,659
(Speak of the devil.)

819
00:28:02,659 --> 00:28:04,269
- Why? - Why do you think so?

820
00:28:04,269 --> 00:28:05,774
- Gosh, it's Jong Kook. - My goodness.

821
00:28:05,900 --> 00:28:07,540
You startled me. Here's the deity of darkness.

822
00:28:07,540 --> 00:28:09,215
- Gosh, it's Jong Kook. - My goodness.

823
00:28:09,769 --> 00:28:10,969
(Soon after Kwang Soo appears...)

824
00:28:10,969 --> 00:28:12,840
- It's not me. - Yes, you are.

825
00:28:12,840 --> 00:28:16,780
- It's either Kwang Soo or Sunny. - It's either Kwang Soo...

826
00:28:16,780 --> 00:28:18,185
- Why me? - or Sunny.

827
00:28:18,550 --> 00:28:20,679
- Why? - It's really not me.

828
00:28:20,679 --> 00:28:22,150
No wonder.

829
00:28:22,150 --> 00:28:25,324
On our way down, he chatted me up.

830
00:28:25,550 --> 00:28:28,734
If someone gets eliminated here...

831
00:28:28,790 --> 00:28:31,590
You know the kinds of things the show likes to air.

832
00:28:31,590 --> 00:28:33,330
- Also, he... - It's settled then.

833
00:28:33,330 --> 00:28:35,130
- It's been decided. - A moving camera is tailing him.

834
00:28:35,130 --> 00:28:37,145
(He suspects Kwang Soo too.)

835
00:28:37,870 --> 00:28:40,239
- Since last week... - A moving camera?

836
00:28:40,239 --> 00:28:42,600
Yes, you should have seen it move up and down.

837
00:28:42,600 --> 00:28:43,640
Really?

838
00:28:43,640 --> 00:28:45,509
- Se Chan's been fixated on that. - Hold on.

839
00:28:45,509 --> 00:28:47,084
Who are you following?

840
00:28:47,409 --> 00:28:48,479
Is this for Kwang Soo?

841
00:28:48,479 --> 00:28:49,479
Really?

842
00:28:49,479 --> 00:28:50,479
When did you start...

843
00:28:50,479 --> 00:28:52,310
How is this mine? That's absurd!

844
00:28:52,310 --> 00:28:54,880
- When did you ever... - That's crazy!

845
00:28:54,880 --> 00:28:56,519
- You're wrong. - Let's...

846
00:28:56,519 --> 00:28:58,489
spread out again then.

847
00:28:58,489 --> 00:28:59,689
We'll eventually need the clues.

848
00:28:59,689 --> 00:29:01,459
Sunny...

849
00:29:01,459 --> 00:29:03,094
The two of you were...

850
00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:04,489
(Sunny's upset about being suspected.)

851
00:29:04,489 --> 00:29:07,199
I can't believe this. It's actually making me mad.

852
00:29:07,199 --> 00:29:09,259
I'm really close to exploding with anger.

853
00:29:09,259 --> 00:29:10,875
(Could she be acting?)

854
00:29:12,929 --> 00:29:15,875
Sunny, there you are.

855
00:29:16,300 --> 00:29:18,484
Two cameras are following Sunny.

856
00:29:19,269 --> 00:29:21,084
Why does she have two cameras on her?

857
00:29:21,679 --> 00:29:23,979
Why are two cameramen following her?

858
00:29:23,979 --> 00:29:26,185
(Is it because she's playing an important role?)

859
00:29:26,709 --> 00:29:29,955
(Meanwhile, Sunny searches for clues.)

860
00:29:30,179 --> 00:29:31,294
Sunny!

861
00:29:31,689 --> 00:29:32,925
What are you doing here?

862
00:29:34,159 --> 00:29:35,365
I'm looking for clues.

863
00:29:36,060 --> 00:29:37,130
Have you found any?

864
00:29:37,159 --> 00:29:39,360
I already know...

865
00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:40,975
(She finds everything about Sunny suspicious.)

866
00:29:41,530 --> 00:29:42,530
You're...

867
00:29:42,530 --> 00:29:43,870
(She's sure that Sunny is the deity of darkness.)

868
00:29:43,870 --> 00:29:45,475
I've already narrowed it down.

869
00:29:46,229 --> 00:29:47,314
Sunny...

870
00:29:47,699 --> 00:29:49,469
You have the wrong person.

871
00:29:49,499 --> 00:29:51,584
It's over if I take off your name tag.

872
00:29:51,640 --> 00:29:53,340
Don't do this.

873
00:29:53,340 --> 00:29:54,610
(If Sunny is the deity of darkness, the humans and deity of light wins.)

874
00:29:54,610 --> 00:29:56,310
Why bet on something you're not sure of?

875
00:29:56,310 --> 00:29:57,880
I'm sure of this.

876
00:29:57,880 --> 00:30:00,780
So you're sure that it's either me or Kwang Soo.

877
00:30:00,780 --> 00:30:03,050
Do you know that there's a special camera following him?

878
00:30:03,080 --> 00:30:05,395
Two cameras were following you around too.

879
00:30:05,489 --> 00:30:07,965
I saw it all from above.

880
00:30:08,759 --> 00:30:11,635
I'm sure that you're the deity of darkness.

881
00:30:11,790 --> 00:30:14,199
- I'm not. - I'm sure of it.

882
00:30:14,199 --> 00:30:16,074
That couldn't be more false.

883
00:30:16,600 --> 00:30:19,074
You're barking up the wrong tree.

884
00:30:19,229 --> 00:30:21,640
Sunny, please!

885
00:30:21,640 --> 00:30:24,409
(Sunny suddenly launches herself at Ye Won.)

886
00:30:24,409 --> 00:30:25,409
Gosh.

887
00:30:25,409 --> 00:30:27,209
(She quickly takes off Ye Won's name tag.)

888
00:30:27,209 --> 00:30:28,554
(Tearing)

889
00:30:30,280 --> 00:30:31,479
(Jang Ye Won is out!)

890
00:30:31,479 --> 00:30:33,850
Sunny...

891
00:30:33,850 --> 00:30:38,564
(Sunny suddenly eliminated Ye Won. Which role is she playing?)

892
00:30:39,749 --> 00:30:41,794
Human Jang Ye Won has been eliminated.

893
00:30:41,989 --> 00:30:43,489
Human Jang Ye Won has been eliminated.

894
00:30:43,489 --> 00:30:44,860
Ye Won was a human?

895
00:30:44,890 --> 00:30:45,890
She's out?

896
00:30:45,890 --> 00:30:47,300
(Both will be eliminated if a human eliminates a human.)

897
00:30:47,300 --> 00:30:48,860
How did Ye Won get eliminated?

898
00:30:48,860 --> 00:30:51,605
(Sunny wasn't eliminated after she eliminated Ye Won.)

899
00:30:52,699 --> 00:30:53,800
I'm exhausted.

900
00:30:53,800 --> 00:30:55,774
(She's either a deity or the prophet.)

901
00:30:55,999 --> 00:30:58,084
Those with big mouths are getting eliminated first.

902
00:30:58,509 --> 00:30:59,840
Unbelievable.

903
00:30:59,909 --> 00:31:03,284
Why is everything so twisted this time?

904
00:31:03,479 --> 00:31:04,554
What's this?

905
00:31:04,850 --> 00:31:06,209
(She locates...)

906
00:31:06,209 --> 00:31:09,780
(a clue box that was left in the corner.)

907
00:31:09,780 --> 00:31:12,850
No way. This is huge.

908
00:31:12,850 --> 00:31:14,935
(There's a board with holes in it.)

909
00:31:15,820 --> 00:31:16,935
No way.

910
00:31:17,659 --> 00:31:19,365
I only came here to drink water.

911
00:31:21,499 --> 00:31:23,530
(She doesn't know how to use the clue though.)

912
00:31:23,530 --> 00:31:25,105
First...

913
00:31:25,300 --> 00:31:26,744
Which one is this?

914
00:31:27,370 --> 00:31:29,800
I need to find the book.

915
00:31:29,800 --> 00:31:32,140
I found the most crucial clue.

916
00:31:32,140 --> 00:31:33,140
(She brings it to the prophecy.)

917
00:31:33,140 --> 00:31:35,880
(She places it on top of the page.)

918
00:31:35,880 --> 00:31:37,850
The prophet...

919
00:31:37,850 --> 00:31:39,855
(Certain letters can be seen through the holes.)

920
00:31:40,650 --> 00:31:41,794
Darkness...

921
00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:45,165
(What clue shocked Ji Hyo?)

922
00:31:45,749 --> 00:31:47,494
It's the prophet.

923
00:31:48,159 --> 00:31:50,219
I must find the prophet first.

924
00:31:50,219 --> 00:31:51,605
(I must find the prophet first!)

925
00:31:53,259 --> 00:31:55,274
(Meanwhile, Jae Seok searches for clues.)

926
00:31:57,100 --> 00:31:58,100
(He finds...)

927
00:31:58,100 --> 00:32:00,774
(an envelope in a gap.)

928
00:32:01,999 --> 00:32:03,300
It's a Temple Summons.

929
00:32:03,300 --> 00:32:05,784
(A Temple Summons is in the envelope.)

930
00:32:06,870 --> 00:32:08,979
(Meanwhile, Kwang Soo is searching elsewhere for clues.)

931
00:32:08,979 --> 00:32:10,254
Everybody, pause.

932
00:32:10,280 --> 00:32:11,880
The temple's door has opened.

933
00:32:11,880 --> 00:32:13,155
What?

934
00:32:13,249 --> 00:32:14,249
Do you have a summons?

935
00:32:14,249 --> 00:32:16,695
No, how can I when I'm right here?

936
00:32:16,749 --> 00:32:19,390
Hold on. I'm calling someone on my list.

937
00:32:19,390 --> 00:32:22,390
(Those with Temple Summons can call someone to the temple.)

938
00:32:22,390 --> 00:32:23,494
Sunny.

939
00:32:23,719 --> 00:32:24,890
(He thinks carefully since it's the last chance.)

940
00:32:24,890 --> 00:32:25,890
Kwang Soo.

941
00:32:25,890 --> 00:32:27,135
(He thinks carefully since it's the last chance.)

942
00:32:28,459 --> 00:32:30,800
(Sunny and Kwang Soo...)

943
00:32:30,800 --> 00:32:33,100
(are prime suspects of being the deity of darkness.)

944
00:32:33,100 --> 00:32:34,400
Sunny and Kwang Soo.

945
00:32:34,400 --> 00:32:35,870
(Jae Seok chooses...)

946
00:32:35,870 --> 00:32:36,939
I choose Sunny.

947
00:32:36,939 --> 00:32:38,984
(Jae Seok chooses Sunny.)

948
00:32:39,840 --> 00:32:42,314
Sunny, you've been summoned to the temple.

949
00:32:43,509 --> 00:32:44,509
(Sunny, a prime suspect, has been called to the temple.)

950
00:32:44,509 --> 00:32:46,080
It's a good day to die.

951
00:32:46,110 --> 00:32:47,355
(Sunny, a prime suspect, has been called to the temple.)

952
00:32:50,080 --> 00:32:51,725
You've been summoned.

953
00:32:52,150 --> 00:32:53,935
- Me? - Yes.

954
00:32:54,590 --> 00:32:56,259
This is stressing me out too much.

955
00:32:56,259 --> 00:32:57,759
You need to head to the temple.

956
00:32:57,790 --> 00:33:00,189
Me? I can't believe this.

957
00:33:00,189 --> 00:33:01,600
(Who summoned Kwang Soo to the temple?)

958
00:33:01,600 --> 00:33:02,905
Kwang Soo's here.

959
00:33:03,330 --> 00:33:05,004
- Get over here. - Come on.

960
00:33:05,269 --> 00:33:06,600
Unbelievable.

961
00:33:06,600 --> 00:33:08,239
- What's going on? - Place your hand here.

962
00:33:08,239 --> 00:33:09,269
(Haha summoned Kwang Soo.)

963
00:33:09,269 --> 00:33:10,744
- Right here. - Place your hand.

964
00:33:11,269 --> 00:33:14,840
(While searching for a clue,)

965
00:33:14,840 --> 00:33:18,254
(he came across a Temple Summons.)

966
00:33:18,350 --> 00:33:19,350
I summon Kwang Soo.

967
00:33:19,350 --> 00:33:20,979
(He summons Kwang Soo, the prime suspect.)

968
00:33:20,979 --> 00:33:22,880
I'm sure of it. What did I tell you?

969
00:33:22,880 --> 00:33:25,294
It has to be him.

970
00:33:25,850 --> 00:33:28,390
(Unbelievable. What's going on?)

971
00:33:28,390 --> 00:33:29,734
- Place your hand here. - Place your hand here.

972
00:33:29,759 --> 00:33:31,360
This is your last chance.

973
00:33:31,360 --> 00:33:32,729
What on earth is this?

974
00:33:32,790 --> 00:33:33,790
What's going on?

975
00:33:33,790 --> 00:33:36,300
(Once all 4 of them place their hands on the table,)

976
00:33:36,300 --> 00:33:39,870
(the screen will show a color depending on who's among them.)

977
00:33:39,870 --> 00:33:41,774
- It won't be white. - All right.

978
00:33:41,969 --> 00:33:44,239
- 1, 2, 3! - 2, 3!

979
00:33:44,239 --> 00:33:45,415
Please.

980
00:33:45,509 --> 00:33:52,679
(Which of the 8 colors will appear on the screen?)

981
00:33:52,679 --> 00:33:53,925
(Temple)

982
00:33:55,880 --> 00:33:57,390
(Purple!)

983
00:33:57,390 --> 00:34:00,320
It will turn purple when all three are present.

984
00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:02,594
(Deity of light, deity of darkness, prophet: purple)

985
00:34:02,959 --> 00:34:04,130
What color is this?

986
00:34:04,130 --> 00:34:06,135
Does that mean the prophet is here too?

987
00:34:06,159 --> 00:34:07,600
- Purple. - They're all here.

988
00:34:07,600 --> 00:34:08,699
Darkness...

989
00:34:08,699 --> 00:34:11,504
(All three of them are here.)

990
00:34:13,169 --> 00:34:14,169
- The prophet... - They're all here.

991
00:34:14,169 --> 00:34:15,475
(They're all here.)

992
00:34:17,410 --> 00:34:20,410
- This is crazy. - Isn't this our last chance?

993
00:34:20,410 --> 00:34:22,014
(They're each playing one of the three roles.)

994
00:34:24,050 --> 00:34:26,150
I was proven to be a human earlier.

995
00:34:26,150 --> 00:34:27,255
Who are you then?

996
00:34:28,180 --> 00:34:30,590
(They start interrogating one another.)

997
00:34:30,590 --> 00:34:31,895
I don't trust you.

998
00:34:31,990 --> 00:34:32,990
I'm the prophet.

999
00:34:32,990 --> 00:34:34,194
(I'm the prophet.)

1000
00:34:35,059 --> 00:34:37,789
(Haha's the prophet?)

1001
00:34:37,789 --> 00:34:39,165
You're the prophet?

1002
00:34:39,889 --> 00:34:43,375
(Then either Sunny or Kwang Soo is the deity of darkness.)

1003
00:34:44,970 --> 00:34:46,444
I'm just saying there is one.

1004
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:48,800
I'm a little suspicious of Sunny too, but still.

1005
00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:50,444
(Who is the deity of darkness?)

1006
00:34:50,910 --> 00:34:53,110
Who of the two is it?

1007
00:34:53,110 --> 00:34:54,579
The race is now over.

1008
00:34:54,579 --> 00:34:56,410
Please join us at the platform of judgment.

1009
00:34:56,410 --> 00:34:58,479
(The deity of darkness hasn't been revealed yet.)

1010
00:34:58,479 --> 00:35:00,680
(The final decision will be made at the platform of judgment.)

1011
00:35:00,680 --> 00:35:03,349
The platform is now ready.

1012
00:35:03,349 --> 00:35:06,220
The two deities have not been eliminated yet,

1013
00:35:06,220 --> 00:35:08,594
so it'll be decided at the platform of judgment.

1014
00:35:08,689 --> 00:35:10,160
The deity of light and humans will win...

1015
00:35:10,160 --> 00:35:11,630
if the deity of darkness goes on it.

1016
00:35:11,630 --> 00:35:15,375
In all other cases, the deity of darkness will win.

1017
00:35:15,760 --> 00:35:17,869
The four of us placed our hands on the table...

1018
00:35:17,869 --> 00:35:19,574
and the screen turned purple.

1019
00:35:19,599 --> 00:35:21,169
So it's one of you three.

1020
00:35:21,169 --> 00:35:25,240
We were able to make a good guess as to who it is.

1021
00:35:25,240 --> 00:35:26,769
The deity of darkness...

1022
00:35:26,769 --> 00:35:32,880
(What did he find out about the deity of darkness?)

1023
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:34,180
- is the prophet. - That's right.

1024
00:35:34,180 --> 00:35:35,220
(It's the prophet?)

1025
00:35:35,220 --> 00:35:36,579
(The deity of darkness is the prophet?)

1026
00:35:36,579 --> 00:35:38,194
It's the same person.

1027
00:35:38,789 --> 00:35:41,964
(He discovered a box while looking for a clue.)

1028
00:35:42,260 --> 00:35:45,605
(He found the same board as Ji Hyo with holes in it.)

1029
00:35:46,289 --> 00:35:48,959
(He checked it against the prophecy.)

1030
00:35:48,959 --> 00:35:51,400
(The prophet's identity was revealed.)

1031
00:35:51,400 --> 00:35:52,900
(The prophet...)

1032
00:35:52,900 --> 00:35:55,999
(is...)

1033
00:35:55,999 --> 00:35:57,944
(the deity of darkness.)

1034
00:35:58,410 --> 00:36:02,255
(The prophet is the deity of darkness.)

1035
00:36:02,380 --> 00:36:04,579
(The prophet and the deity of darkness is the same person.)

1036
00:36:04,579 --> 00:36:07,979
You're the deity of darkness as well as the prophet.

1037
00:36:07,979 --> 00:36:10,990
You will make a fake prophecy and say the spell.

1038
00:36:10,990 --> 00:36:12,789
Humans will believe you...

1039
00:36:12,789 --> 00:36:14,619
and mistake the deity of light as the deity of darkness...

1040
00:36:14,619 --> 00:36:17,320
and try to eliminate the deity of light instead.

1041
00:36:17,320 --> 00:36:18,530
(The prophet was the deity of darkness!)

1042
00:36:18,530 --> 00:36:21,200
It's why I asked who the prophet is.

1043
00:36:21,200 --> 00:36:23,835
This just came to mind.

1044
00:36:23,900 --> 00:36:25,599
- What? - Earlier...

1045
00:36:25,599 --> 00:36:28,369
someone said that he's the prophet.

1046
00:36:28,369 --> 00:36:29,999
(Haha said that he's the prophet.)

1047
00:36:29,999 --> 00:36:31,085
That's right.

1048
00:36:32,209 --> 00:36:33,514
(I'm the prophet!)

1049
00:36:34,439 --> 00:36:37,214
(At the temple, he said he was the prophet.)

1050
00:36:37,280 --> 00:36:38,525
I am a human.

1051
00:36:38,979 --> 00:36:42,880
If I had known about this truth,

1052
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:45,419
I wouldn't have said anything about my identity.

1053
00:36:45,419 --> 00:36:47,665
If you knew that they're the same person?

1054
00:36:47,990 --> 00:36:49,419
I had no idea.

1055
00:36:49,419 --> 00:36:51,435
- The clue about the prophet... - You heard me, right?

1056
00:36:51,490 --> 00:36:53,360
I didn't even find that clue.

1057
00:36:53,360 --> 00:36:54,999
Are you the deity of light then?

1058
00:36:54,999 --> 00:36:56,335
No, I'm human.

1059
00:36:56,760 --> 00:36:58,304
Then who's the deity of light?

1060
00:36:58,430 --> 00:37:00,530
Sunny, who might you be?

1061
00:37:00,530 --> 00:37:02,315
- She's the deity of light. - I'm the deity of light.

1062
00:37:02,369 --> 00:37:05,714
Then why did you try your best in the previous games?

1063
00:37:05,769 --> 00:37:09,110
It's because I knew the clues were the opposite.

1064
00:37:09,110 --> 00:37:11,209
No one knew about that fact...

1065
00:37:11,209 --> 00:37:12,780
and I didn't want to look suspicious.

1066
00:37:12,780 --> 00:37:14,519
- I think she's right. - Me too.

1067
00:37:14,519 --> 00:37:15,579
The others...

1068
00:37:15,579 --> 00:37:18,749
didn't even try to contradict her just now.

1069
00:37:18,749 --> 00:37:20,789
That's because she's the real deal.

1070
00:37:20,789 --> 00:37:22,189
(They aren't saying anything because she's the deity of light?)

1071
00:37:22,189 --> 00:37:24,090
It'll look weird if they say otherwise.

1072
00:37:24,090 --> 00:37:26,634
- That's why... - She's telling the truth.

1073
00:37:26,689 --> 00:37:29,005
I really am the deity of light.

1074
00:37:29,099 --> 00:37:32,400
You will be participating in the Find the Deity Race...

1075
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:34,269
to unlock the secret of the prophecy.

1076
00:37:34,269 --> 00:37:35,269
(Sunny received a mission.)

1077
00:37:35,269 --> 00:37:39,070
You are the deity of light who must shine on the world...

1078
00:37:39,070 --> 00:37:40,309
and defeat the deity of darkness.

1079
00:37:40,309 --> 00:37:41,685
Really?

1080
00:37:43,539 --> 00:37:47,824
(Ye Won mistook Sunny as the deity of darkness.)

1081
00:37:48,550 --> 00:37:52,464
(Sunny was cornered, so she had to eliminate Ye Won.)

1082
00:37:53,389 --> 00:37:54,864
Let's bring her over to our side.

1083
00:37:55,990 --> 00:37:58,160
You have no idea how wronged I felt.

1084
00:37:58,160 --> 00:37:59,935
- She's the light of deity. - She is.

1085
00:38:00,260 --> 00:38:02,059
No one believed me.

1086
00:38:02,059 --> 00:38:03,200
Hey.

1087
00:38:03,200 --> 00:38:05,130
She told me that she was the deity of light.

1088
00:38:05,169 --> 00:38:08,315
- The truth will prevail. - The truth will prevail.

1089
00:38:08,439 --> 00:38:10,700
The truth will prevail.

1090
00:38:10,700 --> 00:38:12,010
Let's vote.

1091
00:38:12,010 --> 00:38:13,944
I choose Haha.

1092
00:38:14,070 --> 00:38:15,180
- Me too. - Me too.

1093
00:38:15,180 --> 00:38:16,240
I choose Haha too.

1094
00:38:16,240 --> 00:38:19,855
(More than half of them chose Haha as the deity of darkness.)

1095
00:38:20,709 --> 00:38:23,150
You couldn't be more mistaken about this,

1096
00:38:23,150 --> 00:38:24,395
but I'll still walk on the platform.

1097
00:38:24,490 --> 00:38:26,249
If I throw a fit in this moment,

1098
00:38:26,249 --> 00:38:28,220
you guys will suspect me even more.

1099
00:38:28,220 --> 00:38:29,860
- He's not getting worked up. - Seriously.

1100
00:38:29,919 --> 00:38:31,090
Should I get worked up?

1101
00:38:31,090 --> 00:38:32,889
Because he's not getting worked up...

1102
00:38:32,889 --> 00:38:33,959
It's not that I'm not worked up.

1103
00:38:33,959 --> 00:38:35,030
I think he's a human.

1104
00:38:35,099 --> 00:38:37,005
It's not that I'm not worked up.

1105
00:38:37,130 --> 00:38:38,169
I can get worked up if you want me to.

1106
00:38:38,169 --> 00:38:40,099
I kept saying it up there.

1107
00:38:40,130 --> 00:38:43,340
(The judges are getting confused because Haha looks frustrated.)

1108
00:38:43,340 --> 00:38:44,645
Gosh, this is really confusing.

1109
00:38:45,470 --> 00:38:47,415
Why didn't you check this, by the way?

1110
00:38:47,910 --> 00:38:50,315
Is it even possible that Kwang Soo didn't know what to do with this?

1111
00:38:50,579 --> 00:38:51,680
I didn't know.

1112
00:38:51,680 --> 00:38:53,025
(Kwang Soo had the same hint as Jong Kook and Ji Hyo.)

1113
00:38:54,380 --> 00:38:55,455
(I had this too.)

1114
00:38:56,150 --> 00:38:58,019
(The hint contained a crucial clue.)

1115
00:38:58,019 --> 00:38:59,994
(I kept putting it on pictures.)

1116
00:39:00,349 --> 00:39:04,534
(Kwang Soo failed to figure out how to use the hint.)

1117
00:39:06,889 --> 00:39:08,360
- I didn't know. - Is it even possible...

1118
00:39:08,360 --> 00:39:09,705
that Kwang Soo didn't know how to use it?

1119
00:39:10,300 --> 00:39:11,900
He's been on Running Man for nine years.

1120
00:39:11,900 --> 00:39:13,400
- It's obviously for letters. - He put this on pictures?

1121
00:39:13,400 --> 00:39:14,545
He put this on pictures?

1122
00:39:14,740 --> 00:39:15,800
He's suspicious.

1123
00:39:15,840 --> 00:39:18,315
Guys, you're being fooled right now.

1124
00:39:18,539 --> 00:39:19,844
I really didn't know.

1125
00:39:20,070 --> 00:39:22,079
You don't know until you actually put it on the page.

1126
00:39:22,079 --> 00:39:24,039
(Who is the deity of darkness,)

1127
00:39:24,039 --> 00:39:26,525
(Haha or Kwang Soo?)

1128
00:39:26,550 --> 00:39:27,979
- Let's take a vote one last time. - Let's do this.

1129
00:39:28,050 --> 00:39:29,295
- I vote for Haha. - Haha.

1130
00:39:30,079 --> 00:39:31,320
- Kwang Soo. - Kwang Soo.

1131
00:39:31,320 --> 00:39:32,450
- Haha. - Haha.

1132
00:39:32,450 --> 00:39:33,789
(They're still divided.)

1133
00:39:33,789 --> 00:39:35,295
This is really frustrating.

1134
00:39:35,720 --> 00:39:36,820
- Pick one. - Kwang Soo.

1135
00:39:36,820 --> 00:39:37,829
Kwang Soo.

1136
00:39:37,829 --> 00:39:39,160
(Kwang Soo, who ignored the hint? Haha, who claims to be the prophet?)

1137
00:39:39,160 --> 00:39:40,329
Me?

1138
00:39:40,329 --> 00:39:41,630
- Is it 2 to 2? - Gosh.

1139
00:39:41,660 --> 00:39:43,829
- Why all of a sudden? - Trust me, seriously.

1140
00:39:43,900 --> 00:39:45,530
- Jong Kook, hurry up. - What's going on?

1141
00:39:45,530 --> 00:39:46,775
I'm not stupid.

1142
00:39:46,800 --> 00:39:49,614
- Something just came to my mind. - What is it?

1143
00:39:49,939 --> 00:39:51,815
I've heard Haha talk this way before.

1144
00:39:51,970 --> 00:39:53,585
- And Haha was the culprit. - That's right.

1145
00:39:53,669 --> 00:39:54,780
- Right. - Jae Seok.

1146
00:39:54,780 --> 00:39:56,709
It was here on the rooftop of SBS.

1147
00:39:56,709 --> 00:39:57,780
That's right.

1148
00:39:57,780 --> 00:39:58,950
Is that what you think?

1149
00:39:58,950 --> 00:40:00,280
Are you suspecting me?

1150
00:40:00,280 --> 00:40:01,550
Is that really what you think?

1151
00:40:01,619 --> 00:40:03,150
- Why all of a sudden? - I'm not stupid.

1152
00:40:03,150 --> 00:40:04,389
- It's Haha. - Haha.

1153
00:40:04,389 --> 00:40:05,689
Listen to the way he speaks.

1154
00:40:05,689 --> 00:40:06,824
You...

1155
00:40:07,519 --> 00:40:10,160
(The result of their race depends on their last choice.)

1156
00:40:10,160 --> 00:40:14,034
(Who will end up on the platform, Kwang Soo or Haha?)

1157
00:40:14,360 --> 00:40:18,669
- Haha, step onto the platform. - He's the one for sure.

1158
00:40:18,669 --> 00:40:20,269
(If Haha turns out to be the deity of darkness,)

1159
00:40:20,269 --> 00:40:21,999
(the deity of light and humans win.)

1160
00:40:21,999 --> 00:40:23,840
- His voice gave him away. - I'm not.

1161
00:40:23,840 --> 00:40:25,045
Seriously.

1162
00:40:25,169 --> 00:40:26,714
I'm not, I swear.

1163
00:40:27,680 --> 00:40:29,685
The way he spoke...

1164
00:40:30,110 --> 00:40:31,709
You shouldn't decide based on that.

1165
00:40:31,709 --> 00:40:33,225
1, 2...

1166
00:40:33,510 --> 00:40:37,019
(Is Haha really the deity of darkness?)

1167
00:40:37,019 --> 00:40:41,594
(Or is he just a human?)

1168
00:40:43,220 --> 00:40:44,689
(Ripping)

1169
00:40:44,689 --> 00:40:46,289
(Prophet and deity of darkness)

1170
00:40:46,289 --> 00:40:47,530
You punk!

1171
00:40:47,530 --> 00:40:48,760
(Haha is the prophet and deity of darkness.)

1172
00:40:48,760 --> 00:40:50,605
- You punk! - I told you!

1173
00:40:50,800 --> 00:40:52,005
I told you!

1174
00:40:52,669 --> 00:40:53,900
I'm a human!

1175
00:40:53,900 --> 00:40:55,014
(Haha was the deity of darkness!)

1176
00:40:55,169 --> 00:40:57,844
(The deity of light and humans win today's race.)

1177
00:40:58,110 --> 00:40:59,309
I could have won.

1178
00:40:59,309 --> 00:41:01,014
(What a shame. I could have won.)

1179
00:41:02,180 --> 00:41:04,139
- Hello. - Oh, my.

1180
00:41:04,139 --> 00:41:05,255
(Before today's shoot)

1181
00:41:06,010 --> 00:41:08,180
(Haha met the staff and received the mission.)

1182
00:41:08,180 --> 00:41:09,594
Goodness. What is it now?

1183
00:41:09,650 --> 00:41:11,490
- You're the prophet... - Right.

1184
00:41:11,490 --> 00:41:13,625
- and deity of darkness. - That's what my mom used to say.

1185
00:41:13,950 --> 00:41:15,165
"You're a son of darkness."

1186
00:41:16,160 --> 00:41:18,534
(That's how Haha became the deity of darkness and the prophet.)

1187
00:41:18,689 --> 00:41:21,835
(So Min was spreading the hints everywhere.)

1188
00:41:22,059 --> 00:41:23,205
(Ripping)

1189
00:41:24,599 --> 00:41:28,074
(So Min is eliminated right away.)

1190
00:41:30,169 --> 00:41:33,444
(Ye Won was collecting as many hints as she could.)

1191
00:41:34,309 --> 00:41:35,514
(Ripping)

1192
00:41:36,740 --> 00:41:38,154
(I asked you to show me.)

1193
00:41:38,849 --> 00:41:41,554
(As Ye Won was closing in on him, Haha eliminated her.)

1194
00:41:41,780 --> 00:41:44,749
The final winners of the Find the Deity Race are...

1195
00:41:44,749 --> 00:41:46,050
the deity of light and Team Humans.

1196
00:41:46,050 --> 00:41:47,349
(The deity of light and Team Humans win...)

1197
00:41:47,349 --> 00:41:48,835
(the Find the Deity Race.)

1198
00:41:49,619 --> 00:41:52,289
The deity of light and Team Humans...

1199
00:41:52,289 --> 00:41:54,660
will receive peaches, which are in season right now, as a prize.

1200
00:41:54,660 --> 00:41:55,875
- Yes! - Yes!

1201
00:41:56,130 --> 00:41:57,630
- This feels nice. - I love peaches!

1202
00:41:57,630 --> 00:41:59,574
Our four guests today...

1203
00:41:59,829 --> 00:42:03,639
Kim Ye Won, Jang Ye Won, Sunny, and Sun Mi.

1204
00:42:03,639 --> 00:42:05,185
They worked very hard today.

1205
00:42:05,340 --> 00:42:07,369
Let's give them a big hand!

1206
00:42:07,369 --> 00:42:08,485
(Thank you for being with us today.)

1207
00:42:09,280 --> 00:42:11,579
We'll meet again at the fan-meet then.

1208
00:42:11,579 --> 00:42:13,380
(Running Man's Fan-Meet starts right now.)

1209
00:42:13,380 --> 00:42:14,895
See you at the fan-meet!

1210
00:42:16,870 --> 00:42:19,815

(to express their love for their fans.)

1219
00:42:40,720 --> 00:42:42,660

Ji Hyo, you're wearing cycling shorts.

1237
00:43:45,620 --> 00:43:47,260
Oh, we were all going to wear them.

1238
00:43:47,260 --> 00:43:48,804
Are you trying to get on our teacher's good side?

1239
00:43:49,289 --> 00:43:50,735
Fine, I copied her. Do you have a problem?

1240
00:43:51,629 --> 00:43:53,405
Is this a sweater or a t-shirt?

1241
00:43:53,459 --> 00:43:54,560
It's a t-shirt sweater.

1242
00:43:54,560 --> 00:43:55,905
(Ji Hyo is annoyed.)

1243
00:43:57,629 --> 00:43:59,039
(They're fighting.)

1244
00:43:59,039 --> 00:44:00,999
Is something bothering you this morning?

1245
00:44:00,999 --> 00:44:02,370
Why are you picking a fight from morning?

1246
00:44:02,370 --> 00:44:04,140
I'm not picking a fight. I'm just talking to you.

1247
00:44:04,140 --> 00:44:05,715
They started fighting as soon as we started filming.

1248
00:44:06,140 --> 00:44:07,709
- Hello. - You're here.

1249
00:44:07,709 --> 00:44:09,379
- Hi. - Hi.

1250
00:44:09,379 --> 00:44:11,080
- Hi. - Jin Lee.

1251
00:44:11,080 --> 00:44:13,125
- Jin Lee and You Jin are here. - You Jin.

1252
00:44:13,149 --> 00:44:14,450
I like You Jin.

1253
00:44:14,450 --> 00:44:15,649
- Hi. - The three of them...

1254
00:44:15,720 --> 00:44:17,189
You're wearing...

1255
00:44:17,189 --> 00:44:18,620
- cycling shorts too. - Of course.

1256
00:44:18,620 --> 00:44:21,164
- We promised you. - You kept your promise.

1257
00:44:21,220 --> 00:44:23,160
I even have a full set.

1258
00:44:23,160 --> 00:44:24,629
- Cycling shorts? - I have a cycling suit.

1259
00:44:24,629 --> 00:44:27,034
(I have a cycling suit.)

1260
00:44:27,260 --> 00:44:29,169
No. It's not good for dancing.

1261
00:44:29,169 --> 00:44:30,930
- I'll wear it someday. - It's not good for dancing.

1262
00:44:30,930 --> 00:44:32,970
- Is it a diving suit? - Wearing something underneath...

1263
00:44:32,970 --> 00:44:34,039
(We'd love to see it.)

1264
00:44:34,039 --> 00:44:35,069
Today,

1265
00:44:35,069 --> 00:44:37,269
we're going to learn formations.

1266
00:44:37,269 --> 00:44:38,709
How to change formations.

1267
00:44:38,709 --> 00:44:40,939
- Formations? - It's important.

1268
00:44:40,939 --> 00:44:42,479
That's what we're going to do today.

1269
00:44:42,479 --> 00:44:44,850
It might be a little complicated...

1270
00:44:44,850 --> 00:44:47,220
- at first. - It's getting worse and worse.

1271
00:44:47,220 --> 00:44:49,319
You'll stand up on eight.

1272
00:44:49,319 --> 00:44:51,695
You on this side will...

1273
00:44:51,789 --> 00:44:54,060
Stand up. There you go.

1274
00:44:54,060 --> 00:44:56,560
You on this side will move to the right.

1275
00:44:56,560 --> 00:44:58,399
Stand up as you slide.

1276
00:44:58,430 --> 00:44:59,430
Stand up.

1277
00:44:59,430 --> 00:45:00,859
But you'll all stand up at different times.

1278
00:45:00,859 --> 00:45:03,804
Let's do this together slowly.

1279
00:45:03,830 --> 00:45:05,775
5, 6, 7, 8.

1280
00:45:05,870 --> 00:45:08,169
- 1, 2, 3, 4, - 1, 2, 3, 4,

1281
00:45:08,169 --> 00:45:10,240
- 5, 6, 7, 8. - 5, 6, 7, 8.

1282
00:45:10,240 --> 00:45:11,414
(Is this right?)

1283
00:45:11,780 --> 00:45:14,085
(Clumsy)

1284
00:45:14,140 --> 00:45:15,680
3, 4.

1285
00:45:15,680 --> 00:45:17,324
Yes! Good job.

1286
00:45:19,919 --> 00:45:21,120
- Are you sure? - Lia.

1287
00:45:21,120 --> 00:45:23,289
- Be serious. - We just did what you told us to.

1288
00:45:23,319 --> 00:45:25,664
Did she think we wouldn't be able to do this?

1289
00:45:26,019 --> 00:45:27,894
It feels like we're back in elementary school again.

1290
00:45:28,330 --> 00:45:30,965
She sounds like a preschool teacher.

1291
00:45:31,089 --> 00:45:32,600
(Good job, grown-ups.)

1292
00:45:32,600 --> 00:45:33,735
Good job.

1293
00:45:35,030 --> 00:45:37,069
You did it.

1294
00:45:37,069 --> 00:45:38,669
Let's try again. I think we can do this.

1295
00:45:38,669 --> 00:45:39,700
I'm feeling confident.

1296
00:45:39,700 --> 00:45:41,410
5, 6, 7, 8.

1297
00:45:41,410 --> 00:45:43,614
(Like this?)

1298
00:45:45,280 --> 00:45:46,339
- We did it. - We did it.

1299
00:45:46,339 --> 00:45:48,149
Give me a pat.

1300
00:45:48,149 --> 00:45:50,684
(Did I do a good job? Please give me a pat.)

1301
00:45:51,519 --> 00:45:53,979
Let me give you a pat.

1302
00:45:53,979 --> 00:45:56,289
(When dancing, they're 7 years old again.)

1303
00:45:56,289 --> 00:45:57,589
Give me candy.

1304
00:45:57,589 --> 00:45:58,795
(He's like a 7-year-old.)

1305
00:45:59,089 --> 00:46:00,319
I pooped!

1306
00:46:00,319 --> 00:46:02,129
(It's getting worse.)

1307
00:46:02,129 --> 00:46:03,405
- Get out. - What?

1308
00:46:03,530 --> 00:46:04,899
- Get out. - What?

1309
00:46:04,899 --> 00:46:06,434
- Get out. - I didn't poop.

1310
00:46:06,459 --> 00:46:07,560
- Get out. - I didn't poop for real.

1311
00:46:07,560 --> 00:46:08,800
- Get out if you pooped. - I didn't.

1312
00:46:08,800 --> 00:46:10,100
Call his mom.

1313
00:46:10,100 --> 00:46:11,370
(Please use the bathroom instead.)

1314
00:46:11,370 --> 00:46:12,970
This is an important part.

1315
00:46:13,039 --> 00:46:14,269
Kwang Soo...

1316
00:46:14,269 --> 00:46:15,810
(Kwang Soo will be standing in the center.)

1317
00:46:15,839 --> 00:46:17,910
You'll come to the center.

1318
00:46:17,970 --> 00:46:19,780
- Seven... - That's cool.

1319
00:46:19,780 --> 00:46:20,855
Slide to the center.

1320
00:46:20,910 --> 00:46:22,149
(Like this?)

1321
00:46:22,149 --> 00:46:23,224
That's right.

1322
00:46:23,780 --> 00:46:25,319
And then, "come on".

1323
00:46:25,319 --> 00:46:26,580
(Come on.)

1324
00:46:26,580 --> 00:46:28,789
- "Come on." - It looks annoying.

1325
00:46:28,789 --> 00:46:30,490
It looks so annoying.

1326
00:46:30,490 --> 00:46:32,164
This is his best part so far.

1327
00:46:32,220 --> 00:46:34,089
That was best "come on" part you've done.

1328
00:46:34,089 --> 00:46:36,859
Now you'll zigzag down.

1329
00:46:36,859 --> 00:46:39,735
Zigzag, zigzag.

1330
00:46:40,030 --> 00:46:41,030
But the thing is,

1331
00:46:41,030 --> 00:46:42,675
your movement will be very slight.

1332
00:46:42,769 --> 00:46:45,140
Zigzag only slightly.

1333
00:46:45,169 --> 00:46:46,574
How do you do that?

1334
00:46:46,839 --> 00:46:47,870
Kwang Soo.

1335
00:46:47,870 --> 00:46:49,585
(It looks like he's getting an electric shock.)

1336
00:46:50,010 --> 00:46:51,655
- He's a dancer. - Unbelievable.

1337
00:46:52,010 --> 00:46:53,479
He's an amazing dancer.

1338
00:46:53,539 --> 00:46:54,855
You have to zigzag very slightly.

1339
00:46:55,010 --> 00:46:56,755
You did this part better than the teacher.

1340
00:46:57,450 --> 00:46:59,724
(It's as if his neck is possessed.)

1341
00:46:59,850 --> 00:47:00,994
Zigzag.

1342
00:47:01,649 --> 00:47:03,625
There you go. You're doing great.

1343
00:47:03,919 --> 00:47:05,534
Ji Hyo, don't shake your head.

1344
00:47:06,260 --> 00:47:07,419
(Who teaches who?)

1345
00:47:07,419 --> 00:47:09,264
- Focus on your moves. - Why are you shaking your head?

1346
00:47:09,330 --> 00:47:10,560
You try.

1347
00:47:10,629 --> 00:47:12,399
Imagine you're in between two walls.

1348
00:47:12,399 --> 00:47:13,930
Good. You look great.

1349
00:47:13,930 --> 00:47:15,644
(Imagine you're bumping into the walls.)

1350
00:47:16,970 --> 00:47:18,439
(Stiff)

1351
00:47:18,439 --> 00:47:19,715
You're good.

1352
00:47:19,839 --> 00:47:21,169
Good job.

1353
00:47:21,169 --> 00:47:22,310
You're good.

1354
00:47:22,310 --> 00:47:24,085
- Are you sick? - You did a good job.

1355
00:47:24,209 --> 00:47:25,379
(In his mind, he's a great dancer.)

1356
00:47:25,379 --> 00:47:26,715
I'm in trouble.

1357
00:47:27,109 --> 00:47:29,184
All right. Kwang Soo, let me show you what you'll do.

1358
00:47:29,479 --> 00:47:31,149
You're the one...

1359
00:47:31,149 --> 00:47:32,855
who controls the other members.

1360
00:47:33,180 --> 00:47:34,454
You're the conqueror.

1361
00:47:35,189 --> 00:47:36,319
You'll pretend...

1362
00:47:36,390 --> 00:47:38,890
you're pulling them up.

1363
00:47:38,890 --> 00:47:40,289
- From the floor. - You're going to mime.

1364
00:47:40,289 --> 00:47:41,319
You're good.

1365
00:47:41,319 --> 00:47:42,359
- "I'm controlling you." - You're good.

1366
00:47:42,359 --> 00:47:43,430
All the way up here.

1367
00:47:43,430 --> 00:47:44,764
Higher up. There you go.

1368
00:47:44,899 --> 00:47:47,160
Raise your arms all the way up there,

1369
00:47:47,160 --> 00:47:48,875
and press them down this time.

1370
00:47:48,899 --> 00:47:51,574
5, 6, 7, 8.

1371
00:47:51,999 --> 00:47:53,445
Like this. Good.

1372
00:47:53,600 --> 00:47:55,410
And the rest of us zigzag down?

1373
00:47:55,410 --> 00:47:57,209
Exactly. Zigzag down.

1374
00:47:57,209 --> 00:47:58,439
I'm not going down.

1375
00:47:58,439 --> 00:47:59,439
Why?

1376
00:47:59,439 --> 00:48:01,514
(I'm not going down.)

1377
00:48:02,249 --> 00:48:03,979
- Why are you not going down? - I don't want to be controlled.

1378
00:48:03,979 --> 00:48:05,594
- You have to go down. - No.

1379
00:48:05,850 --> 00:48:07,749
You have to be controlled by me.

1380
00:48:07,749 --> 00:48:08,819
I'm going up instead.

1381
00:48:08,819 --> 00:48:10,249
Why is he so stubborn?

1382
00:48:10,249 --> 00:48:11,319
I'm going up.

1383
00:48:11,350 --> 00:48:13,065
- He's so stubborn. - I'm going up.

1384
00:48:13,620 --> 00:48:14,689
Next.

1385
00:48:14,760 --> 00:48:18,399
You'll make way for Jae Seok so that he can come to the center.

1386
00:48:18,399 --> 00:48:20,499
(They'll make way for Jae Seok.)

1387
00:48:20,499 --> 00:48:22,144
(It's finally my turn.)

1388
00:48:22,700 --> 00:48:24,330
The rest of you will stay still.

1389
00:48:24,330 --> 00:48:25,744
Jae Seok will...

1390
00:48:26,269 --> 00:48:28,709
will walk forward.

1391
00:48:28,709 --> 00:48:30,769
Then you will stretch your arm to the front.

1392
00:48:30,769 --> 00:48:32,554
- 1, 2. - 2.

1393
00:48:33,280 --> 00:48:36,585
- Then put the other arm up. - What was that?

1394
00:48:36,709 --> 00:48:38,010
- Don't stand near me. - Okay.

1395
00:48:38,010 --> 00:48:39,394
My movements tend to be big.

1396
00:48:39,450 --> 00:48:40,720
- Okay. - Don't stand near me.

1397
00:48:40,720 --> 00:48:41,965
- Be careful. - Okay.

1398
00:48:42,419 --> 00:48:44,764
One. Throw.

1399
00:48:44,890 --> 00:48:46,919
- Then lift up one knee. - Lift it up.

1400
00:48:46,919 --> 00:48:49,189
Lift it up and go, boom, boom, boom, boom.

1401
00:48:49,189 --> 00:48:50,959
(Lift it up and go, boom, boom, boom, boom.)

1402
00:48:50,959 --> 00:48:54,060
(Boom, boom, boom, boom?)

1403
00:48:54,060 --> 00:48:56,030
(He suddenly becomes embarrassed.)

1404
00:48:56,030 --> 00:48:58,069
- That's... - It's our first chance to laugh.

1405
00:48:58,069 --> 00:48:59,215
It's our first chance to laugh.

1406
00:48:59,640 --> 00:49:00,740
For goodness' sake.

1407
00:49:00,740 --> 00:49:02,315
It's your first chance to laugh.

1408
00:49:02,510 --> 00:49:04,614
(Laughing)

1409
00:49:04,870 --> 00:49:06,140
That's so cute.

1410
00:49:06,140 --> 00:49:07,414
(Laughing)

1411
00:49:07,879 --> 00:49:10,224
(My goodness.)

1412
00:49:10,580 --> 00:49:12,580
He needs to do that as he walks out, right?

1413
00:49:12,580 --> 00:49:14,249
He needs to do that as soon as he walks out.

1414
00:49:14,249 --> 00:49:15,950
It would be a disaster if you mess up the steps.

1415
00:49:15,950 --> 00:49:17,224
This is bad.

1416
00:49:17,249 --> 00:49:18,934
I bet he will fall down.

1417
00:49:19,160 --> 00:49:21,534
Jae Seok will mess up the steps.

1418
00:49:22,660 --> 00:49:24,789
(Floundering)

1419
00:49:24,789 --> 00:49:27,430
(Take this!)

1420
00:49:27,430 --> 00:49:28,499
(I might do that.)

1421
00:49:28,499 --> 00:49:29,830
- I might do that. - Seriously.

1422
00:49:29,830 --> 00:49:30,870
(They will have to practice hard.)

1423
00:49:30,870 --> 00:49:32,439
I bet Jae Seok will fall down.

1424
00:49:32,439 --> 00:49:33,870
He does that when he is pressured.

1425
00:49:33,870 --> 00:49:35,569
- Shall we begin right away? - Yes.

1426
00:49:35,569 --> 00:49:36,569
Okay.

1427
00:49:36,569 --> 00:49:38,014
Go to your positions.

1428
00:49:38,069 --> 00:49:39,954
Let's begin right away.

1429
00:49:40,109 --> 00:49:41,724
Haha, you will go,

1430
00:49:42,050 --> 00:49:44,379
1, 2, 3, and...

1431
00:49:44,379 --> 00:49:47,780
You will control everyone else's body.

1432
00:49:47,780 --> 00:49:49,164
Is it my time?

1433
00:49:49,249 --> 00:49:51,195
You will turn their heads first.

1434
00:49:51,589 --> 00:49:53,019
- Heads. - Then you will turn their bodies.

1435
00:49:53,019 --> 00:49:54,319
- Bodies. - Then...

1436
00:49:54,319 --> 00:49:56,390
the dancers will go...

1437
00:49:56,390 --> 00:49:58,129
Let's go. Heads, bodies.

1438
00:49:58,129 --> 00:50:00,030
- Let's go. 1, 2. - 1, 2.

1439
00:50:00,030 --> 00:50:01,100
(Turn, turn.)

1440
00:50:01,100 --> 00:50:02,974
- Yes. - The moves are quite fast.

1441
00:50:03,200 --> 00:50:04,830
Then we will go, push, push.

1442
00:50:04,830 --> 00:50:06,939
(Move as Haha pushes.)

1443
00:50:06,939 --> 00:50:11,370
Okay. One more time. 1, 2, 3, and push, push.

1444
00:50:11,370 --> 00:50:12,839
(Turn, turn, push, push.)

1445
00:50:12,839 --> 00:50:14,310
- That's incredible. - Does it look cool?

1446
00:50:14,310 --> 00:50:15,379
- I can't see it. - It looks cool.

1447
00:50:15,379 --> 00:50:16,450
- I can't see it. - I want to see it.

1448
00:50:16,450 --> 00:50:17,709
- I stand out so much. - It's very cool.

1449
00:50:17,709 --> 00:50:20,080
(I stand out so much.)

1450
00:50:20,080 --> 00:50:21,319
(He thinks it's cool because he stands out so much.)

1451
00:50:21,319 --> 00:50:24,065
He is so annoying.

1452
00:50:24,289 --> 00:50:27,120
In the next move, Haha will look incredibly cool.

1453
00:50:27,120 --> 00:50:29,764
(In the next move, Haha will look incredibly cool.)

1454
00:50:30,359 --> 00:50:32,605
Until when will he stand in the center?

1455
00:50:32,700 --> 00:50:34,229
He already looks cool.

1456
00:50:34,300 --> 00:50:35,600
He looks cool in every move.

1457
00:50:35,600 --> 00:50:38,045
(I am the best student in dance.)

1458
00:50:38,899 --> 00:50:41,539
- He is like his son, Dream. - Dream.

1459
00:50:41,539 --> 00:50:42,569
Dream.

1460
00:50:42,569 --> 00:50:45,914
Haha, I will teach you your move.

1461
00:50:46,140 --> 00:50:47,939
Kick, kick.

1462
00:50:47,939 --> 00:50:49,625
Kick to the left then to the right.

1463
00:50:49,709 --> 00:50:51,184
To make this look cool,

1464
00:50:51,479 --> 00:50:53,824
the kicks should be effortless.

1465
00:50:53,950 --> 00:50:55,519
- Effortless. - That's right.

1466
00:50:55,519 --> 00:50:57,425
- Effortless. - Effortless.

1467
00:50:57,450 --> 00:50:58,919
- Effortless. - Okay.

1468
00:50:58,919 --> 00:51:00,359
(Effortless, but cool.)

1469
00:51:00,359 --> 00:51:02,804
(Like this?)

1470
00:51:03,289 --> 00:51:05,600
- Good job. - He is good.

1471
00:51:05,600 --> 00:51:06,760
He did it perfectly.

1472
00:51:06,760 --> 00:51:07,905
Good job.

1473
00:51:08,229 --> 00:51:09,669
- My goodness. - Now...

1474
00:51:09,669 --> 00:51:12,339
- He did a good job, right? - He is good.

1475
00:51:12,339 --> 00:51:13,399
He is good.

1476
00:51:13,399 --> 00:51:15,045
He is such an eyesore.

1477
00:51:15,609 --> 00:51:17,709
Shall we go over this part one more time?

1478
00:51:17,769 --> 00:51:19,240
Get ready. Let's start from the beginning.

1479
00:51:19,240 --> 00:51:21,514
- Heads. - Let's start from the heads.

1480
00:51:21,609 --> 00:51:23,580
Ready, set, go.

1481
00:51:23,580 --> 00:51:26,149
1, 2, 3, and 4.

1482
00:51:26,149 --> 00:51:27,950
5, 6.

1483
00:51:27,950 --> 00:51:31,364
Zigzag, wave.

1484
00:51:33,890 --> 00:51:35,530
Wave.

1485
00:51:35,530 --> 00:51:38,704
(Effortless)

1486
00:51:38,830 --> 00:51:40,229
(You did an amazing job.)

1487
00:51:40,229 --> 00:51:41,229
You did an amazing job.

1488
00:51:41,229 --> 00:51:43,169
- We made no mistakes, - Are you sure this is going well?

1489
00:51:43,169 --> 00:51:46,100
but our expressions showed how nervous we were.

1490
00:51:46,100 --> 00:51:47,499
We were so nervous.

1491
00:51:47,499 --> 00:51:48,914
Everyone was frozen.

1492
00:51:49,370 --> 00:51:52,939
Next, you will spread out.

1493
00:51:52,939 --> 00:51:55,379
The two of you won't spread out.

1494
00:51:55,379 --> 00:51:56,755
- It's time for the best part. - Yes.

1495
00:51:57,379 --> 00:51:59,724
- It's time for the best part. - Here comes the best part.

1496
00:52:00,080 --> 00:52:01,525
- This is the beginning. - All right.

1497
00:52:01,649 --> 00:52:02,720
This is great.

1498
00:52:02,720 --> 00:52:04,824
J.K. and Sopee.

1499
00:52:05,220 --> 00:52:06,419
(It's J.K. and Sopee's turn.)

1500
00:52:06,419 --> 00:52:07,789
Come on out.

1501
00:52:07,789 --> 00:52:09,505
(They are the nicknames from the 457th episode.)

1502
00:52:10,359 --> 00:52:12,300
- 1, 2. - Put it on the thigh.

1503
00:52:12,300 --> 00:52:14,405
Spread your legs out more.

1504
00:52:14,530 --> 00:52:15,629
1, 2, 3.

1505
00:52:15,629 --> 00:52:16,999
(When Jong Kook lifts So Min up, she will lift her legs up and turn.)

1506
00:52:16,999 --> 00:52:17,999
That was nice, but...

1507
00:52:17,999 --> 00:52:20,069
- Your legs should be straight. - When you go up,

1508
00:52:20,069 --> 00:52:22,370
you should put your hands on his shoulders...

1509
00:52:22,370 --> 00:52:23,539
and your shin on his upper thigh.

1510
00:52:23,539 --> 00:52:25,439
- So Min, this is your chance. - Your shin.

1511
00:52:25,439 --> 00:52:27,640
(So Min, this is your chance.)

1512
00:52:27,640 --> 00:52:28,979
Your shin.

1513
00:52:28,979 --> 00:52:30,280
Kick his private part.

1514
00:52:30,280 --> 00:52:31,554
Be careful.

1515
00:52:32,749 --> 00:52:34,355
I will end you if you kick the wrong spot.

1516
00:52:35,189 --> 00:52:36,364
Hang in there.

1517
00:52:36,819 --> 00:52:38,664
So Min is heavier than she looks.

1518
00:52:38,859 --> 00:52:42,089
You aren't heavy at all, so do what you need to do.

1519
00:52:42,089 --> 00:52:45,129
(You aren't heavy at all, so do what you need to do.)

1520
00:52:45,129 --> 00:52:46,875
He is the man.

1521
00:52:47,499 --> 00:52:48,899
He is the man.

1522
00:52:48,899 --> 00:52:50,300
She is very heavy.

1523
00:52:50,300 --> 00:52:52,939
(He is a dependable man.)

1524
00:52:52,939 --> 00:52:55,539
(I will trust you.)

1525
00:52:55,539 --> 00:52:58,755
All right. Let's go.

1526
00:52:59,410 --> 00:53:01,855
Let's go.

1527
00:53:02,080 --> 00:53:03,850
1, 2.

1528
00:53:03,850 --> 00:53:06,625
(Jong Kook holds her hand and spins her.)

1529
00:53:07,419 --> 00:53:09,350
(As they learned,)

1530
00:53:09,350 --> 00:53:11,965
(they show the perfect move.)

1531
00:53:12,720 --> 00:53:13,859
(That was impressive.)

1532
00:53:13,859 --> 00:53:15,660
Good job.

1533
00:53:15,660 --> 00:53:18,164
- I can't believe they did it. - Sopee and J.K.!

1534
00:53:18,289 --> 00:53:19,859
J.K. and Sopee!

1535
00:53:19,859 --> 00:53:22,074
- Sopee! Sopee! - Good job.

1536
00:53:22,269 --> 00:53:23,669
(They look good together.)

1537
00:53:23,669 --> 00:53:24,830
Here comes the next move.

1538
00:53:24,830 --> 00:53:26,545
You will spin once.

1539
00:53:27,069 --> 00:53:29,470
- 1, 2, 3... - What?

1540
00:53:29,470 --> 00:53:31,169
At four, you will put your hands around his neck.

1541
00:53:31,169 --> 00:53:35,709
(Spin once and put your hands around the partner's neck.)

1542
00:53:35,709 --> 00:53:37,050
- Put your hands around his neck. - Hold on.

1543
00:53:37,050 --> 00:53:39,249
Isn't this too sexy? This show is for 12 years and older.

1544
00:53:39,249 --> 00:53:40,350
No, it isn't.

1545
00:53:40,350 --> 00:53:42,319
We are quite innocent.

1546
00:53:42,390 --> 00:53:45,390
You are seeing this in a strange light.

1547
00:53:45,390 --> 00:53:48,319
Then comes... 4, 5, 6, 7.

1548
00:53:48,319 --> 00:53:49,430
(Jump and get on your partner.)

1549
00:53:49,430 --> 00:53:52,300
Stretch out one arm. 7, 8, and 1.

1550
00:53:52,300 --> 00:53:54,200
(Spin mid-air and land.)

1551
00:53:54,200 --> 00:53:58,175
(It's the most difficult move.)

1552
00:53:58,399 --> 00:54:00,215
He is the man!

1553
00:54:00,269 --> 00:54:01,470
Sopee!

1554
00:54:01,470 --> 00:54:02,945
(Sopee makes a complaint.)

1555
00:54:02,970 --> 00:54:04,945
- You can do this. - I need to go on a diet.

1556
00:54:05,069 --> 00:54:07,554
- It's okay. - I need to go on a diet.

1557
00:54:08,339 --> 00:54:09,510
- Let's go. - Okay.

1558
00:54:09,510 --> 00:54:11,085
Go slowly.

1559
00:54:11,249 --> 00:54:12,519
My goodness.

1560
00:54:12,519 --> 00:54:14,149
(They try to copy what they learned.)

1561
00:54:14,149 --> 00:54:15,864
From here...

1562
00:54:16,390 --> 00:54:17,990
- 1, 2. - Spin.

1563
00:54:17,990 --> 00:54:20,959
- They need teamwork. - Put your hands around his neck.

1564
00:54:20,959 --> 00:54:22,335
Jump up.

1565
00:54:22,490 --> 00:54:23,764
Look at Jong Kook's face.

1566
00:54:24,890 --> 00:54:26,399
- My goodness. - Look at Jong Kook's face.

1567
00:54:26,399 --> 00:54:28,875
- Look at Jong Kook's face. - Jong Kook.

1568
00:54:29,229 --> 00:54:31,700
- Jong Kook, she is heavy, right? - Jong Kook.

1569
00:54:31,700 --> 00:54:33,700
- 7, 8. - Jong Kook.

1570
00:54:33,700 --> 00:54:36,045
- 1, 2. - He is shocked.

1571
00:54:36,709 --> 00:54:39,114
(Shaking)

1572
00:54:40,109 --> 00:54:41,609
(He hurriedly puts her down.)

1573
00:54:41,609 --> 00:54:43,350
- Jong Kook. - You were a bit...

1574
00:54:43,350 --> 00:54:45,010
- Don't be like that. - He gritted his teeth.

1575
00:54:45,010 --> 00:54:46,080
(He gritted his teeth.)

1576
00:54:46,080 --> 00:54:48,220
- Jong Kook, you gritted your teeth. - Jong Kook.

1577
00:54:48,220 --> 00:54:49,249
Jong Kook.

1578
00:54:49,249 --> 00:54:50,789
- Jong Kook. - I mean...

1579
00:54:50,789 --> 00:54:52,490
- They got it on the camera. - I saw your face.

1580
00:54:52,490 --> 00:54:54,490
- They got it on the camera. - You gritted your teeth.

1581
00:54:54,490 --> 00:54:56,930
- Give them some tips. - Seriously.

1582
00:54:56,930 --> 00:54:59,399
- She needs to trust him and let go. - That's right.

1583
00:54:59,399 --> 00:55:01,060
- Don't tighten up. - That's right.

1584
00:55:01,060 --> 00:55:02,499
- Let go. - It's really okay.

1585
00:55:02,499 --> 00:55:04,970
I don't know why you'd tense up.

1586
00:55:04,970 --> 00:55:06,700
(Laughing)

1587
00:55:06,700 --> 00:55:07,899
Do you like him?

1588
00:55:07,899 --> 00:55:09,939
(Do you like Jong Kook?)

1589
00:55:09,939 --> 00:55:11,784
(For goodness' sake.)

1590
00:55:11,910 --> 00:55:13,780
- You catch me this time. - Why would I hold you?

1591
00:55:13,780 --> 00:55:15,284
(Come on, Se Chan.)

1592
00:55:15,479 --> 00:55:16,810
Lift me up.

1593
00:55:16,810 --> 00:55:18,125
- What? - Lift me up.

1594
00:55:18,280 --> 00:55:19,780
What is up with you?

1595
00:55:19,780 --> 00:55:21,050
For goodness' sake.

1596
00:55:21,050 --> 00:55:22,394
That came out of nowhere.

1597
00:55:22,789 --> 00:55:23,965
That came out of nowhere.

1598
00:55:24,019 --> 00:55:25,390
- That came out of nowhere. - That came out of nowhere.

1599
00:55:25,390 --> 00:55:26,519
Se Chan.

1600
00:55:26,519 --> 00:55:27,664
(Sliding down)

1601
00:55:27,919 --> 00:55:29,030
That came out of nowhere.

1602
00:55:29,030 --> 00:55:31,859
(As soon as she puts her knee on his thigh, he slides down.)

1603
00:55:31,859 --> 00:55:33,229
What are you doing?

1604
00:55:33,229 --> 00:55:35,399
(It suddenly turned into professional wrestling.)

1605
00:55:35,399 --> 00:55:37,244
(Se Chan got knocked out.)

1606
00:55:38,229 --> 00:55:39,399
(He gets a knee kick.)

1607
00:55:39,399 --> 00:55:41,339
Lift me up. Lift me up.

1608
00:55:41,339 --> 00:55:42,939
I know you can lift me up.

1609
00:55:42,939 --> 00:55:44,539
- It hurts here. - I know you can lift me up.

1610
00:55:44,539 --> 00:55:46,780
- This part hurts. - I know you can lift me up.

1611
00:55:46,780 --> 00:55:48,784
So Min, what are you doing?

1612
00:55:48,879 --> 00:55:50,649
Kwang Soo, give it a try.

1613
00:55:50,709 --> 00:55:52,180
- What? - Kwang Soo, give it a try.

1614
00:55:52,180 --> 00:55:53,749
- Kwang Soo, give it a try. - I can't do it.

1615
00:55:53,749 --> 00:55:54,879
- How? - I can't.

1616
00:55:54,879 --> 00:55:56,065
What are you doing?

1617
00:55:56,089 --> 00:55:57,364
Lift me up. Lift me up.

1618
00:55:57,550 --> 00:55:58,620
Lift me up.

1619
00:55:58,620 --> 00:56:00,394
I know you can lift me up.

1620
00:56:00,560 --> 00:56:02,859
(Kwang Soo gets a jump kick.)

1621
00:56:02,859 --> 00:56:04,505
(She denies the reality.)

1622
00:56:04,729 --> 00:56:07,160
(For goodness' sake.)

1623
00:56:07,160 --> 00:56:08,530
(They are in tatters.)

1624
00:56:08,530 --> 00:56:10,129
I know you can lift me up.

1625
00:56:10,129 --> 00:56:11,744
I know you can lift me up.

1626
00:56:12,140 --> 00:56:13,200
So Min.

1627
00:56:13,200 --> 00:56:15,300
Only Jong Kook can lift So Min up.

1628
00:56:15,300 --> 00:56:17,209
- You will hurt them. - That was hilarious.

1629
00:56:17,209 --> 00:56:19,780
- Hello. - Hello.

1630
00:56:19,780 --> 00:56:22,609
Now, So Min and Ji Hyo will come to the center.

1631
00:56:22,609 --> 00:56:24,209
(It's the day of practice for So Min and Ji Hyo's part.)

1632
00:56:24,209 --> 00:56:25,550
You know,

1633
00:56:25,550 --> 00:56:27,649
So Min has a part...

1634
00:56:27,649 --> 00:56:29,120
with Ji Hyo.

1635
00:56:29,120 --> 00:56:30,749
- They are in it together. - They are in it together.

1636
00:56:30,749 --> 00:56:32,120
They do this together.

1637
00:56:32,120 --> 00:56:34,189
She is ready for that part.

1638
00:56:34,189 --> 00:56:36,335
- She wants to show off. - Look at her.

1639
00:56:36,890 --> 00:56:38,060
So Min stretched.

1640
00:56:38,060 --> 00:56:39,474
No, no, no.

1641
00:56:40,060 --> 00:56:41,129
Stop it.

1642
00:56:41,129 --> 00:56:43,370
(Punching)

1643
00:56:43,370 --> 00:56:45,074
Why are you fighting again?

1644
00:56:45,700 --> 00:56:46,939
You need to stretch your muscles.

1645
00:56:46,939 --> 00:56:48,375
- It's okay! - You will be fine afterward.

1646
00:56:48,769 --> 00:56:50,609
You need to stretch your muscles.

1647
00:56:50,609 --> 00:56:52,045
(Let me play too.)

1648
00:56:52,680 --> 00:56:54,339
(Stop it.)

1649
00:56:54,339 --> 00:56:56,184
(Hitting)

1650
00:56:58,149 --> 00:56:59,950
(She hit Jae Seok's head by mistake.)

1651
00:56:59,950 --> 00:57:01,180
Ji Hyo, it's me.

1652
00:57:01,180 --> 00:57:02,425
(Jae Seok gets attacked at his attempt to play.)

1653
00:57:02,819 --> 00:57:03,990
Ji Hyo, it's me.

1654
00:57:03,990 --> 00:57:05,534
- I am sorry. - You...

1655
00:57:05,620 --> 00:57:06,990
Ji Hyo, you...

1656
00:57:06,990 --> 00:57:09,129
I have never seen Jae Seok get hit so hard on the head.

1657
00:57:09,129 --> 00:57:10,990
- I heard a loud smack. - Are you okay?

1658
00:57:10,990 --> 00:57:13,335
- Ji Hyo, you are incredible. - All right.

1659
00:57:13,760 --> 00:57:16,069
Please make this formation.

1660
00:57:16,069 --> 00:57:18,669
Ji Hyo is at the front. Ji Hyo, you are at the center.

1661
00:57:18,669 --> 00:57:20,269
(After warming up, Ji Hyo and So Min take the center.)

1662
00:57:20,269 --> 00:57:24,769
(Ji Hyo and So Min stand...)

1663
00:57:24,769 --> 00:57:28,640
(while the others spread out to each side.)

1664
00:57:28,640 --> 00:57:30,879
(Then the center's part starts.)

1665
00:57:30,879 --> 00:57:34,649
Then comes the pelvic move. Let's go up to that move.

1666
00:57:34,649 --> 00:57:36,324
Right, left, right.

1667
00:57:36,450 --> 00:57:38,425
- Right, left, right. - Right, left, right.

1668
00:57:38,649 --> 00:57:40,459
Left, right, left.

1669
00:57:40,519 --> 00:57:42,359
- Left, right, left. - Left, right, left.

1670
00:57:42,359 --> 00:57:44,890
- I hate this so much. - This is like a children's dance.

1671
00:57:44,890 --> 00:57:46,129
- I hate this so much. - I like it.

1672
00:57:46,129 --> 00:57:48,760
- This is like a children's dance. - It will go...

1673
00:57:48,760 --> 00:57:50,769
We can't dance like you.

1674
00:57:50,769 --> 00:57:52,470
- Let's go over this again. - This is...

1675
00:57:52,470 --> 00:57:53,740
Go faster. 7, 8.

1676
00:57:53,740 --> 00:57:56,169
Right, left, right. Left, right, left. One more time.

1677
00:57:56,169 --> 00:57:57,669
Right, left, right. Left, right, left.

1678
00:57:57,669 --> 00:57:58,885
My stomach hurts.

1679
00:57:59,010 --> 00:58:00,979
- It's cute. - What?

1680
00:58:00,979 --> 00:58:02,649
All right. It's time for the two female members.

1681
00:58:02,649 --> 00:58:04,109
(This is when Ji Hyo and So Min do their dance.)

1682
00:58:04,109 --> 00:58:05,925
(First, they need to watch.)

1683
00:58:07,450 --> 00:58:10,195
(The elegant double wave)

1684
00:58:10,689 --> 00:58:11,795
It's so cool.

1685
00:58:14,990 --> 00:58:16,835
(Controlled)

1686
00:58:19,560 --> 00:58:21,760
(They show a difficult move of leaning back.)

1687
00:58:21,760 --> 00:58:25,244
(The decalcomania dance)

1688
00:58:26,269 --> 00:58:29,184
(The sequence ends with the powerful arm swing.)

1689
00:58:29,740 --> 00:58:33,039
(They are so cool.)

1690
00:58:33,039 --> 00:58:34,609
(It's a festival.)

1691
00:58:34,609 --> 00:58:36,085
(Hitting)

1692
00:58:36,580 --> 00:58:37,649
(My goodness.)

1693
00:58:37,649 --> 00:58:39,149
My goodness.

1694
00:58:39,149 --> 00:58:40,620
I was too excited.

1695
00:58:40,620 --> 00:58:42,649
- I hope they pull it off. - They danced slowly for us.

1696
00:58:42,649 --> 00:58:45,065
- I hope they pull it off. - They danced slowly for us.

1697
00:58:45,089 --> 00:58:47,060
Did you dance slowly?

1698
00:58:47,060 --> 00:58:48,720
Yes. We slowed down the rhythm.

1699
00:58:48,720 --> 00:58:49,859
- Haha, they danced slowly. - You can do it.

1700
00:58:49,859 --> 00:58:51,565
- Good luck. - Good luck.

1701
00:58:51,660 --> 00:58:54,375
So Min, the dance is really cool.

1702
00:58:54,459 --> 00:58:56,974
I will do So Min's part, and she will do Ji Hyo's part.

1703
00:58:57,069 --> 00:58:59,815
One. Lean back.

1704
00:58:59,939 --> 00:59:02,100
Your back should be...

1705
00:59:02,100 --> 00:59:03,470
- She took dance lessons. - like this.

1706
00:59:03,470 --> 00:59:05,985
- Straighten your knees. - She will break her back.

1707
00:59:06,339 --> 00:59:07,910
- She will break her back. - Straighten your knees.

1708
00:59:07,910 --> 00:59:09,950
Ji Hyo is as stiff as us.

1709
00:59:09,950 --> 00:59:10,950
That's right. Do this.

1710
00:59:10,950 --> 00:59:14,120
- She should lean back more. - Ji Hyo is as flexible as Seok Jin.

1711
00:59:14,120 --> 00:59:16,519
- They are about the same. - Her body is like a rod.

1712
00:59:16,519 --> 00:59:17,819
She can't bend her back.

1713
00:59:17,819 --> 00:59:18,965
- Now... - For goodness' sake.

1714
00:59:19,390 --> 00:59:20,390
- Bend your back. - You should try it.

1715
00:59:20,390 --> 00:59:22,019
- She is doing a good job. - "You should try it."

1716
00:59:22,019 --> 00:59:23,629
- What? - Bend your back.

1717
00:59:23,629 --> 00:59:24,934
Why would I do that?

1718
00:59:26,260 --> 00:59:27,260
My goodness.

1719
00:59:27,260 --> 00:59:28,629
- Why would I do that? - You can't do it.

1720
00:59:28,629 --> 00:59:30,605
His age is already bent.

1721
00:59:30,899 --> 00:59:32,569
(He is at his prime at the age of 54.)

1722
00:59:32,569 --> 00:59:34,100
That's true.

1723
00:59:34,169 --> 00:59:35,370
Let's resume.

1724
00:59:35,370 --> 00:59:37,939
It looks much sexier...

1725
00:59:37,939 --> 00:59:41,280
when you put your hand right on your face.

1726
00:59:41,280 --> 00:59:44,109
- Is that facial expression okay? - Ji Hyo.

1727
00:59:44,109 --> 00:59:45,149
(Grimacing)

1728
00:59:45,149 --> 00:59:47,954
- No. - Ji Hyo, you look scary.

1729
00:59:48,180 --> 00:59:49,695
"Headache, toothache."

1730
00:59:50,149 --> 00:59:51,990
(It's like a painkiller commercial.)

1731
00:59:51,990 --> 00:59:53,695
Isn't that a painkiller commercial?

1732
00:59:53,859 --> 00:59:56,434
- You should do something like this. - It's like...

1733
00:59:56,459 --> 00:59:57,660
It's like this.

1734
00:59:57,660 --> 00:59:58,729
(Like this?)

1735
00:59:58,729 --> 01:00:00,905
- One more time. - So Min looks like...

1736
01:00:00,999 --> 01:00:03,569
she is sad to be behind Ji Hyo.

1737
01:00:03,569 --> 01:00:05,530
She is trying hard to show off.

1738
01:00:05,530 --> 01:00:06,839
She is trying hard to show off.

1739
01:00:06,839 --> 01:00:08,200
Twist.

1740
01:00:08,200 --> 01:00:09,669
So Min.

1741
01:00:09,669 --> 01:00:11,514
(Sexy)

1742
01:00:12,240 --> 01:00:13,684
(I refuse to see this.)

1743
01:00:15,379 --> 01:00:16,550
(Showing off)

1744
01:00:16,550 --> 01:00:17,879
Look to the front.

1745
01:00:17,879 --> 01:00:19,824
- For goodness' sake. - I see you.

1746
01:00:19,879 --> 01:00:21,620
- So Min. - She is unbelievable.

1747
01:00:21,620 --> 01:00:23,589
- You are doing great. - She wants to stand out.

1748
01:00:23,620 --> 01:00:24,724
"Keep your eyes on me."

1749
01:00:24,749 --> 01:00:26,660
It's like, boom, boom.

1750
01:00:26,660 --> 01:00:28,120
(It's time to get down for real.)

1751
01:00:28,120 --> 01:00:30,359
Move your head.

1752
01:00:30,359 --> 01:00:31,804
(The wave begins.)

1753
01:00:33,999 --> 01:00:35,744
(Controlled)

1754
01:00:36,470 --> 01:00:38,899
(Ji Hyo is one step behind,)

1755
01:00:38,899 --> 01:00:40,939
(and So Min is busy showing off.)

1756
01:00:40,939 --> 01:00:41,970
(I am the best.)

1757
01:00:41,970 --> 01:00:43,315
There you go.

1758
01:00:44,539 --> 01:00:48,255
- Hold on. - 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8.

1759
01:00:48,439 --> 01:00:50,550
Right, left, right. Left, right, left.

1760
01:00:50,550 --> 01:00:52,550
(Right, left, right. Left, right, left.)

1761
01:00:52,550 --> 01:00:54,979
- All right. - 1, 2, 3, 4.

1762
01:00:54,979 --> 01:00:57,819
- 1, 2, 3, 4. - 1, 2, 3, 4.

1763
01:00:57,819 --> 01:00:58,819
Okay.

1764
01:00:58,819 --> 01:01:00,120
(What?)

1765
01:01:00,120 --> 01:01:02,089
(The three idiots come to the front.)

1766
01:01:02,089 --> 01:01:04,129
(We aren't idiots.)

1767
01:01:04,129 --> 01:01:05,804
(Anyone would think that they are idiots.)

1768
01:01:06,459 --> 01:01:08,530
- What is that? - My goodness.

1769
01:01:08,560 --> 01:01:09,569
(We aren't idiots.)

1770
01:01:09,569 --> 01:01:10,930
Hey, hey, hey!

1771
01:01:10,999 --> 01:01:12,074
We changed the dance to this.

1772
01:01:12,470 --> 01:01:14,140
My goodness.

1773
01:01:14,140 --> 01:01:16,169
- I like this one. - Right?

1774
01:01:16,169 --> 01:01:18,109
We need to make people laugh once.

1775
01:01:18,109 --> 01:01:19,240
- Once. - We need to make people laugh once.

1776
01:01:19,240 --> 01:01:21,054
She is shocked.

1777
01:01:21,109 --> 01:01:23,550
If you allow them to do that, I won't sit still.

1778
01:01:23,550 --> 01:01:25,180
What are you going to do?

1779
01:01:25,180 --> 01:01:26,454
Okay?

1780
01:01:26,649 --> 01:01:28,450
If you allow them to do that, I won't sit still.

1781
01:01:28,450 --> 01:01:31,089
You can't do that.

1782
01:01:31,089 --> 01:01:34,894
Left foot and right arm. Pull and pull.

1783
01:01:35,060 --> 01:01:37,660
1, 2, 3, down.

1784
01:01:37,660 --> 01:01:39,859
1, 2, 7, down.

1785
01:01:39,859 --> 01:01:41,335
(Difficult moves continue on.)

1786
01:01:42,330 --> 01:01:46,074
(What will be the result of their practice?)

1787
01:01:49,740 --> 01:01:52,069
(August 26)

1788
01:01:52,069 --> 01:01:54,539

1789

(Running Man's Fan-Meet: Nine Years of Running Man)

1790
01:01:55,850 --> 01:01:56,979
(Kim Jong Kook, congratulations on the 24th anniversary of your debut.)

1791
01:01:56,979 --> 01:02:01,425
(They receive support and love from all over the world.)

1792

1796
01:02:11,260 --> 01:02:14,034
(2,400 people were chosen through quizzes and stories.)

1797

(The fan-meet is ready to begin.)

1798
01:02:21,740 --> 01:02:22,769
(The fans took out their precious time for the event.)

1799
01:02:22,769 --> 01:02:24,370
Hello.

1800
01:02:24,370 --> 01:02:27,014
- Hello. - Please look over here.

1801
01:02:27,439 --> 01:02:30,149
I wanted to make good memories with my daughter.

1802
01:02:30,149 --> 01:02:32,350
We only watch Running Man when we meet up.

1803
01:02:32,350 --> 01:02:35,454
My grandma wanted to come since I like the show so much.

1804
01:02:35,620 --> 01:02:37,249
We took an early leave from school.

1805
01:02:37,249 --> 01:02:39,859
I watched the show from the first episode. It's so fun.

1806
01:02:39,859 --> 01:02:41,260
Did you apply for the fan-meet for your daughter?

1807
01:02:41,260 --> 01:02:42,704
No, for myself.

1808
01:02:43,560 --> 01:02:44,560
Running Man, let's go.

1809
01:02:44,560 --> 01:02:46,060
In 1, 2, 3.

1810
01:02:46,060 --> 01:02:47,499
- Running Man, let's go. - Running Man, let's go.

1811
01:02:47,499 --> 01:02:48,804
(The fan-meet is ready to begin with the avid viewers.)

1812
01:02:50,830 --> 01:02:53,215
Let's begin the rehearsal.

1813
01:02:53,669 --> 01:02:56,945
(The final rehearsal is taking place.)

1814
01:02:58,339 --> 01:03:02,215
(The artists for collaborations are ready to go.)

1815
01:03:04,350 --> 01:03:07,519
When I think about the stage, my heart beats so fast.

1816
01:03:07,519 --> 01:03:08,950
Gosh, I am sweating.

1817
01:03:08,950 --> 01:03:10,065
(They become nervous as time approaches.)

1818
01:03:11,050 --> 01:03:13,094
(They are extremely nervous about the first fan-meet in Korea.)

1819
01:03:13,220 --> 01:03:15,905
(The rehearsal ends as they grow more anxious.)

1820
01:03:16,289 --> 01:03:19,164
More than my body,

1821
01:03:19,629 --> 01:03:21,934
my mind is exhausted.

1822
01:03:21,999 --> 01:03:23,870
I think we will feel empty tomorrow morning.

1823
01:03:23,870 --> 01:03:25,069
It's bound to happen.

1824
01:03:25,129 --> 01:03:27,300
It will be embarrassing once this airs.

1825
01:03:27,300 --> 01:03:29,310
- We will feel empty. - When this episode airs,

1826
01:03:29,310 --> 01:03:30,784
I will be outside.

1827
01:03:31,339 --> 01:03:32,879
(Jae Seok is outside at this moment.)

1828
01:03:32,879 --> 01:03:35,454
This is so embarrassing. My wife wanted to come,

1829
01:03:35,709 --> 01:03:37,180
but I told her to stay at home.

1830
01:03:37,180 --> 01:03:38,249
(He didn't want his wife to come and support him.)

1831
01:03:38,249 --> 01:03:39,850
- This is embarrassing. - This is so embarrassing.

1832
01:03:39,850 --> 01:03:42,550
- Knock, knock. Good work, everyone. - Na Eun.

1833
01:03:42,550 --> 01:03:45,025
(The woman with a sweet voice visits the tired members.)

1834
01:03:45,149 --> 01:03:46,519
What did you bring?

1835
01:03:46,519 --> 01:03:47,990
- Na Eun. - Good work, everyone.

1836
01:03:47,990 --> 01:03:49,704
- My goodness. - Hey.

1837
01:03:49,760 --> 01:03:51,560
- Thank you, Na Eun. - This is a protein drink.

1838
01:03:51,560 --> 01:03:53,930
- You should get some protein. - Look at this.

1839
01:03:53,930 --> 01:03:56,970
Dancing is an exercise, so you need protein.

1840
01:03:56,970 --> 01:03:59,740
- This is coconut flavor. - I need protein.

1841
01:03:59,740 --> 01:04:02,169
This could make a hearty meal.

1842
01:04:02,169 --> 01:04:04,140
This takes care of a meal!

1843
01:04:04,140 --> 01:04:05,209
(The protein drink takes care of a meal.)

1844
01:04:05,209 --> 01:04:06,439
(He is ridiculous.)

1845
01:04:06,439 --> 01:04:08,510
I will end you if you have a meal today.

1846
01:04:08,510 --> 01:04:10,585
(You said this takes care of a meal.)

1847
01:04:11,850 --> 01:04:14,120
- Remember what you said. - I won't have a meal.

1848
01:04:14,120 --> 01:04:16,019
Don't have a meal. I will keep my eyes on you.

1849
01:04:16,019 --> 01:04:17,594
(Thanks to Na Eun's present, they gain energy.)

My voice keeps getting hoarse.

1859

I don't like feeling nervous before an event.

- I know. - What time is it now?

1861
01:04:51,350 --> 01:04:52,735
It's about time.

1862
01:04:53,019 --> 01:04:54,795
It will start at 7 p.m., right?

(Four teams of artists are in another waiting room.)

1865
01:05:01,260 --> 01:05:05,100
(They wouldn't have felt so nervous had this been their concert.)

1866
01:05:05,100 --> 01:05:09,344
(They feel a sense of responsibility for the members.)

1867

Running Man's fan-meet that celebrates...

its ninth anniversary will get started in earnest.

1889
01:06:07,760 --> 01:06:09,100
Jae Seok, take this.

1890
01:06:09,100 --> 01:06:10,505
- What is that? - What is that?

1891
01:06:11,269 --> 01:06:12,530
(Is that a cue card?)

1892
01:06:12,530 --> 01:06:14,014
- Is there a mission? - What?

1893
01:06:14,140 --> 01:06:15,769
- What? - What is this cue card?

1894
01:06:15,769 --> 01:06:17,445
Is there a mission?

1895
01:06:17,769 --> 01:06:19,339
(What did they give us?)

1896
01:06:19,339 --> 01:06:20,514
What is this? What?

1897
01:06:20,609 --> 01:06:22,140
- What is it? - Come on!

1898
01:06:22,140 --> 01:06:24,149
"There is a spy among you today."

1899
01:06:24,149 --> 01:06:25,550
Come on!

1900
01:06:25,550 --> 01:06:26,879
(There is a spy among you today.)

1901
01:06:26,879 --> 01:06:28,749
(It took 3 months to prepare for the fan-meet.)

1902
01:06:28,749 --> 01:06:31,125
(How could there be a spy?)

1903
01:06:31,749 --> 01:06:33,260
For goodness' sake.

1904
01:06:33,260 --> 01:06:34,660
Let's just have the concert.

1905
01:06:34,660 --> 01:06:36,459
How could there be a spy when we are having a concert?

1906
01:06:36,459 --> 01:06:37,560
Is this a regular shoot?

1907
01:06:37,560 --> 01:06:39,629
- It's absurd. - What can a spy do?

1908
01:06:39,629 --> 01:06:42,729
What will you do if we make mistakes on the stage?

1909
01:06:42,729 --> 01:06:44,870
I can't believe there is a spy...

1910
01:06:44,870 --> 01:06:46,914
- when we prepared so hard. - Seriously.

1911
01:06:47,140 --> 01:06:49,470
- This is so hard. - This is driving me crazy.

1912
01:06:49,470 --> 01:06:51,344
- There is a spy among us? - For three months...

1913
01:06:51,769 --> 01:06:52,939
- Oh! - What?

1914
01:06:52,939 --> 01:06:54,180
Ji Hyo used a different waiting room.

1915
01:06:54,180 --> 01:06:55,979
(Ji Hyo used a different waiting room earlier.)

1916
01:06:55,979 --> 01:06:56,979
(Ji Hyo moved to a different waiting room.)

1917
01:06:56,979 --> 01:06:59,249
Why did you use a different waiting room than us?

1918
01:06:59,249 --> 01:07:00,519
- Ji Hyo. - I mean...

1919
01:07:00,519 --> 01:07:02,120
- I got it now. - It's about her time to be it.

1920
01:07:02,120 --> 01:07:03,925
No, it's not me.

1921
01:07:04,749 --> 01:07:07,664
(Is today's spy Ji Hyo?)

1922
01:07:08,260 --> 01:07:09,534
Ji Hyo is a spy.

1923
01:07:09,760 --> 01:07:11,859
(The artists also have to guess the spy.)

1924
01:07:11,859 --> 01:07:13,629
- Ji Hyo, you look very nervous. - Jae Seok.

1925
01:07:13,629 --> 01:07:15,160
Why are you stammering?

1926
01:07:15,160 --> 01:07:18,399
Everyone is listening, so I can't talk.

1927
01:07:18,399 --> 01:07:21,569
For your information, fans in the audience know...

1928
01:07:21,569 --> 01:07:22,640
who the spy is.

1929
01:07:22,640 --> 01:07:23,769
- Really? - How?

1930
01:07:23,769 --> 01:07:26,209
(The audience already knows who the spy is.)

1931
01:07:26,209 --> 01:07:27,510
I'm not it, right?

1932
01:07:27,510 --> 01:07:28,879
- Who's the spy? - I'm not, right?

1933
01:07:28,879 --> 01:07:31,050
Can the audience tell us who the spy is by mistake?

1934
01:07:31,080 --> 01:07:32,585
That won't happen.

1935
01:07:32,609 --> 01:07:34,050
- Is there one spy? - What is the spy doing?

1936
01:07:34,050 --> 01:07:36,824
A mission was already given to the spy.

1937
01:07:36,919 --> 01:07:39,720
We asked the spy to be the most passionate...

1938
01:07:39,720 --> 01:07:41,019
today.

1939
01:07:41,089 --> 01:07:42,459
"Being passionate"?

1940
01:07:42,459 --> 01:07:44,589
- The mission is... - Passionate.

1941
01:07:44,589 --> 01:07:46,304
being the most passionate.

1942
01:07:47,100 --> 01:07:48,499
We'll find out during the opening.

1943
01:07:48,499 --> 01:07:50,499
(We'll find out during the opening.)

1944
01:07:50,499 --> 01:07:51,675
- During the opening. - What did you say?

1945
01:07:51,700 --> 01:07:52,700
Are you nervous?

1946
01:07:52,700 --> 01:07:54,175
Please breathe.

1947
01:07:54,439 --> 01:07:55,939
He didn't breathe.

1948
01:07:55,939 --> 01:07:57,385
(His speaking manners are the same in front of the audience.)

1949
01:07:57,410 --> 01:07:59,414
Finding the spy will be an individual game.

1950
01:07:59,609 --> 01:08:00,979
Once the fan-meet performance is over...

1951
01:08:00,979 --> 01:08:03,454
and you vote the right person individually, you win.

1952
01:08:03,749 --> 01:08:06,950
Members who don't vote correctly will be penalized on stage.

1953
01:08:06,950 --> 01:08:08,594
- Penalized on stage? - Yes.

1954
01:08:08,720 --> 01:08:11,565
(They'll be penalized here.)

1955
01:08:11,720 --> 01:08:14,390
(We'll see Kwang Soo get penalized.)

1956
01:08:14,390 --> 01:08:17,164
Also, if the spy isn't voted as the most passionate person,

1957
01:08:17,729 --> 01:08:21,100
the spy will be penalized for failing to clear the mission.

1958
01:08:21,100 --> 01:08:22,629
- If he isn't voted? - Yes.

1959
01:08:22,699 --> 01:08:25,305
If the audience doesn't vote him, it means that he failed the mission.

1960
01:08:25,529 --> 01:08:26,744
How can it be judged?

1961
01:08:27,239 --> 01:08:28,470
You'll be given hints about the spy...

1962
01:08:28,499 --> 01:08:30,685
starting with your individual performance.

1963
01:08:30,709 --> 01:08:32,739
Every time you finish your performance,

1964
01:08:32,739 --> 01:08:34,585
the audience's reaction will be measured in decibels.

1965
01:08:34,980 --> 01:08:36,879
If it's over 120dB...

1966
01:08:36,879 --> 01:08:39,409
(If the shout from the audience is over 120dB, they get a hint.)

1967
01:08:39,409 --> 01:08:42,354
you'll obtain a hint about the spy backstage.

1968
01:08:42,520 --> 01:08:44,994
- Why are you doing this? - What's this?

1969
01:08:45,150 --> 01:08:46,989
- We always do our best. - I know.

1970
01:08:46,989 --> 01:08:48,265
We're doing our best.

1971
01:08:48,289 --> 01:08:50,459
What if you are less popular?

1972
01:08:50,459 --> 01:08:53,459
(What if you are less popular?)

1973
01:08:53,459 --> 01:08:54,800
(Everyone gets solemn as he recognizes himself quickly.)

1974
01:08:54,800 --> 01:08:56,529
- About decibel... - Seok Jin.

1975
01:08:56,529 --> 01:08:58,604
Many people are laughing.

1976
01:08:59,029 --> 01:09:02,774
(Who are these kind people responding to his comment?)

1977
01:09:03,169 --> 01:09:04,984
My grandmother said that you're the best.

1978
01:09:05,110 --> 01:09:06,814
Everyone, help us.

1979
01:09:06,839 --> 01:09:09,015
We have to reach 120dB.

1980
01:09:09,850 --> 01:09:12,725
(They sympathize his appeal.)

1981
01:09:12,879 --> 01:09:15,449
This feels like Running Man.

1982
01:09:15,449 --> 01:09:17,220
- It's great. - I know.

1983
01:09:17,220 --> 01:09:19,220
They just won't let us perform in peace.

1984
01:09:19,220 --> 01:09:20,789
It's my first time performing.

1985
01:09:20,860 --> 01:09:22,489
You must go on stage now.

1986
01:09:22,489 --> 01:09:23,529
- Okay. - Oh my goodness.

1987
01:09:23,529 --> 01:09:25,360
Here's your opening mission.

1988
01:09:25,360 --> 01:09:27,400
- Is there a mission? - Forget the mission.

1989
01:09:27,400 --> 01:09:29,029
Here's your opening mission.

1990
01:09:29,029 --> 01:09:31,199
(There's an opening mission?)

1991
01:09:31,270 --> 01:09:33,440
- Why are you giving us a mission? - Just let us perform.

1992
01:09:33,440 --> 01:09:34,999
We have a lot to do.

1993
01:09:34,999 --> 01:09:36,914
- Will someone get eliminated? - What?

1994
01:09:37,070 --> 01:09:40,079
- We might not get hints. - People are waiting for us.

1995
01:09:40,079 --> 01:09:41,279
- What are they? - They're boxes.

1996
01:09:41,279 --> 01:09:43,079
- They're boxes. - What boxes?

1997
01:09:43,079 --> 01:09:45,409
It's already difficult without a mission.

1998
01:09:45,409 --> 01:09:48,919
- Oh, it's that. - I'm already nervous as it is.

1999
01:09:48,919 --> 01:09:51,020
- What is this? - Is this how it's done?

2000
01:09:51,020 --> 01:09:52,095
Our names are on it.

2001
01:09:52,489 --> 01:09:53,959
- There are names in the front. - You're right.

2002
01:09:54,020 --> 01:09:56,260
Kwang Soo, can you open the curtain in the back?

2003
01:09:56,260 --> 01:09:57,890
(Kwang Soo, can you open the curtain in the back?)

2004
01:09:57,890 --> 01:09:59,064
Here?

2005
01:09:59,930 --> 01:10:01,560
- What? - What is this?

2006
01:10:01,560 --> 01:10:03,574
(Prison uniform?)

2007
01:10:03,600 --> 01:10:05,930
(At the fan-meet...)

2008
01:10:05,930 --> 01:10:07,274
They really are prison uniforms.

2009
01:10:07,699 --> 01:10:09,640
- Each of you... - Is this a prison?

2010
01:10:09,640 --> 01:10:11,539
I told you that it's a prison setup as soon as we arrived.

2011
01:10:11,539 --> 01:10:12,814
Right, you said that.

2012
01:10:12,909 --> 01:10:15,614
(Is it escaping the room instead of being a fan-meet?)

2013
01:10:15,779 --> 01:10:18,010
Inside two boxes given to each of you,

2014
01:10:18,079 --> 01:10:20,779
there's a shirt with a photo of your face on it...

2015
01:10:20,850 --> 01:10:23,925
and a shirt with Seok Jin's face on it.

2016
01:10:24,489 --> 01:10:25,789
Pick one box.

2017
01:10:25,789 --> 01:10:28,659
If you pick a shirt with your face on it,

2018
01:10:28,659 --> 01:10:31,390
you can keep your current outfit for the opening performance.

2019
01:10:31,459 --> 01:10:32,864
- Hey. - If...

2020
01:10:32,959 --> 01:10:36,204
(They keep their normal outfit if they pick their own t-shirt.)

2021
01:10:36,770 --> 01:10:39,070
(If they pick the shirt with Seok Jin on it...)

2022
01:10:39,070 --> 01:10:40,470
If you pick the shirt with Seok Jin...

2023
01:10:40,470 --> 01:10:42,140
We took a long time to pick this outfit.

2024
01:10:42,140 --> 01:10:43,270
Will we wear that?

2025
01:10:43,270 --> 01:10:45,110
If you pick the shirt with Seok Jin's face on it,

2026
01:10:45,110 --> 01:10:46,440
you will wear the prison uniform...

2027
01:10:46,440 --> 01:10:48,154
- for the opening. - We invited many people.

2028
01:10:48,510 --> 01:10:50,310
- What are we doing right now? - Listen.

2029
01:10:50,310 --> 01:10:51,824
That doesn't cover you up properly.

2030
01:10:52,279 --> 01:10:54,350
Are you telling us to do the opening in this?

2031
01:10:54,350 --> 01:10:56,690
For Seok Jin, other than a shirt with his own face,

2032
01:10:56,690 --> 01:10:58,690
there's a shirt with Yondu's photo on it.

2033
01:10:58,690 --> 01:11:00,220
- Okay. - That's how it will work.

2034
01:11:00,220 --> 01:11:01,320
- Do we pick between the two? - Wait.

2035
01:11:01,320 --> 01:11:03,230
Why is it Seok Jin? Is there something about him?

2036
01:11:03,230 --> 01:11:04,390
Is he a spy?

2037
01:11:04,390 --> 01:11:06,060
(Why is it Seok Jin? Is there something about him?)

2038
01:11:06,060 --> 01:11:07,459
- Right. - Is he a spy?

2039
01:11:07,459 --> 01:11:08,629
Why did they use Seok Jin's face?

2040
01:11:08,629 --> 01:11:10,669
- Why would I be a spy? - Is it because...

2041
01:11:10,669 --> 01:11:11,869
you were different in our group photo?

2042
01:11:11,869 --> 01:11:13,914
Is it because Seok Jin is a dud?

2043
01:11:14,970 --> 01:11:17,209
(The t-shirt is perfect as a dud.)

2044
01:11:17,209 --> 01:11:18,839
Let's start one by one.

2045
01:11:18,839 --> 01:11:20,339
- Go, Haha. - I'll start.

2046
01:11:20,339 --> 01:11:22,515
- I'll pick the top one. - It's either 1 or 2.

2047
01:11:22,539 --> 01:11:24,625
Between 1 and 2,

2048
01:11:24,650 --> 01:11:26,010
I pick number one.

2049
01:11:26,010 --> 01:11:27,919
I can't go on stage in that uniform.

2050
01:11:27,919 --> 01:11:29,449
Everyone, give me a chance.

2051
01:11:29,449 --> 01:11:31,295
(Everyone, give me a chance.)

2052
01:11:31,589 --> 01:11:34,935
(Let it be Seok Jin's t-shirt.)

2053
01:11:35,690 --> 01:11:37,430
It's interesting.

2054
01:11:37,489 --> 01:11:39,604
I didn't look. 1, 2, 3!

2055
01:11:40,430 --> 01:11:41,805
1, 2, 3!

2056
01:11:42,499 --> 01:11:44,369
- It's Seok Jin. - It's mine.

2057
01:11:44,369 --> 01:11:45,805
(He picks Seok Jin's shirt.)

2058
01:11:45,999 --> 01:11:47,800
(Haha has to wear the prison uniform.)

2059
01:11:47,800 --> 01:11:49,145
Okay.

2060
01:11:49,600 --> 01:11:51,444
That's too bad. Haha is dressed well today.

2061
01:11:51,640 --> 01:11:54,614
(Prisoner number 1 is born.)

2062
01:11:54,810 --> 01:11:57,725
(The audience is happy as long as it's not them.)

2063
01:11:58,079 --> 01:11:59,720
Goodness, is this true?

2064
01:11:59,720 --> 01:12:02,119
- Yes, it must be true. - It feels like a dream.

2065
01:12:02,119 --> 01:12:03,489
I also feel like I'm dreaming.

2066
01:12:03,489 --> 01:12:05,564
(Instead of being a fan-meet, it's a race.)

2067
01:12:05,589 --> 01:12:06,690
Is it me?

2068
01:12:06,690 --> 01:12:08,095
- Which one did you pick? - Number one.

2069
01:12:08,390 --> 01:12:09,789
(She picks number 1 thinking that it won't repeat.)

2070
01:12:09,789 --> 01:12:11,265
I pick number one.

2071
01:12:11,459 --> 01:12:12,564
Three.

2072
01:12:13,100 --> 01:12:14,175
It's me.

2073
01:12:14,730 --> 01:12:15,835
I'm jealous.

2074
01:12:16,529 --> 01:12:19,739
(She proves herself lucky in front of the audience.)

2075
01:12:19,739 --> 01:12:20,940
I got mine.

2076
01:12:20,940 --> 01:12:23,739
- Let's hurry. I pick number 2. - Number 2.

2077
01:12:23,739 --> 01:12:24,944
- Goodness. - It's me.

2078
01:12:25,839 --> 01:12:27,079
(He gets a prison uniform.)

2079
01:12:27,079 --> 01:12:28,215
I pick number one.

2080
01:12:28,480 --> 01:12:30,980
(The audience laughs as the number of prisoner increases.)

2081
01:12:30,980 --> 01:12:32,225
I pick number one.

2082
01:12:32,810 --> 01:12:34,020
- Okay. - It's Kwang Soo.

2083
01:12:34,020 --> 01:12:35,779
(Okay, it's my t-shirt.)

2084
01:12:35,779 --> 01:12:36,820
Most of them are number one.

2085
01:12:36,820 --> 01:12:39,625
(Kwang Soo's careless choice disappoints the audience.)

2086
01:12:39,820 --> 01:12:40,919
(So Min picks her own shirt too.)

2087
01:12:40,919 --> 01:12:42,164
- It's you. - It's me.

2088
01:12:42,220 --> 01:12:43,459
- Seok Jin. - Okay.

2089
01:12:43,459 --> 01:12:44,959
- I keep my outfit, right? - Right.

2090
01:12:44,989 --> 01:12:46,204
Okay.

2091
01:12:46,629 --> 01:12:48,175
I'll finally go out looking handsome.

2092
01:12:48,300 --> 01:12:49,560
- I pick... - Jae Seok.

2093
01:12:49,560 --> 01:12:50,675
I pick number one.

2094
01:12:50,730 --> 01:12:52,045
- Yes, Jae Seok. - I pick number one.

2095
01:12:52,369 --> 01:12:53,545
Yes, Jae Seok.

2096
01:12:53,640 --> 01:12:56,545
(He picks Seok Jin's shirt.)

2097
01:12:56,839 --> 01:13:00,385
(Everyone is surprised when he gets a dud.)

2098
01:13:00,610 --> 01:13:02,255
This is the case except for one.

2099
01:13:02,279 --> 01:13:03,925
- Nice. - I picked number two.

2100
01:13:04,079 --> 01:13:05,154
For those...

2101
01:13:05,579 --> 01:13:07,320
who got the prison uniform,

2102
01:13:07,320 --> 01:13:08,619
if the audience shouts...

2103
01:13:08,619 --> 01:13:10,664
and we hear it in the waiting room,

2104
01:13:10,850 --> 01:13:13,664
- you don't have to wear it. - Really?

2105
01:13:14,589 --> 01:13:17,505
(Audience decides who wears the prison uniform.)

2106
01:13:17,629 --> 01:13:21,604
(It's a mission planned in trust of the fans.)

2107
01:13:21,699 --> 01:13:24,369
Everyone, either one is fine with me,

2108
01:13:24,430 --> 01:13:25,545
but I'd like...

2109
01:13:25,829 --> 01:13:27,515
to dress well if I can.

2110
01:13:28,169 --> 01:13:29,470
Shout!

2111
01:13:29,470 --> 01:13:31,645
(Shout!)

2112
01:13:31,940 --> 01:13:34,914
(Shouting)

2113
01:13:37,810 --> 01:13:39,755
- We can hear it. - Do we hear it?

2114
01:13:39,820 --> 01:13:41,020
- We heard it. - I heard it.

2115
01:13:41,020 --> 01:13:42,919
- We hear the sound. - Thank you.

2116
01:13:42,919 --> 01:13:45,864
We wear the prison uniform if you don't shout.

2117
01:13:45,890 --> 01:13:47,060
- Who's next? - It's Jong Kook.

2118
01:13:47,060 --> 01:13:48,265
Everyone.

2119
01:13:49,760 --> 01:13:51,029
- Appeal yourself. - I beg you.

2120
01:13:51,029 --> 01:13:52,329
(He begs politely.)

2121
01:13:52,360 --> 01:13:53,675
Shout!

2122
01:13:54,360 --> 01:13:55,529
(After Jong Kook's polite plea)

2123
01:13:55,529 --> 01:13:57,774
1, 2, 3.

2124
01:13:58,070 --> 01:14:00,215
(The result will be revealed on stage.)

2125
01:14:00,600 --> 01:14:02,669
(The first performance of Running Man's Fan-Meet starts.)

2126
01:14:02,669 --> 01:14:05,739
("Only One for Me" by all Running Man members)

2127
01:14:05,739 --> 01:14:08,879
(The one to start the performance of Running Man's Fan-Meet is...)

2128
01:14:08,879 --> 01:14:11,755
(is the Asian Prince.)

2129
01:14:13,480 --> 01:14:16,864
(Audience screams as he looks better than expected.)

2130
01:14:30,070 --> 01:14:32,805
(Oh, no. I'm so nervous.)

2131
01:14:32,999 --> 01:14:34,845
- He's pretending to be warm. - Suddenly.

2132
01:14:35,039 --> 01:14:36,199
(He smiles warmly.)

2133
01:14:36,199 --> 01:14:38,185
- What? - He pretends to be a warm man.

2134
01:14:41,180 --> 01:14:44,824
(Once Kwang Soo's handsome-looking part is over,)

2135
01:14:45,980 --> 01:14:48,354
(Haha appears.)

2136
01:14:48,720 --> 01:14:50,895
(I lose my mind, and my eyes close)

2137
01:14:51,850 --> 01:14:55,194
(The performance is stable due to Haha's appearance.)

2138
01:14:56,159 --> 01:14:58,789
(Ji Hyo's heart is about to explode as she watches.)

2139
01:14:58,789 --> 01:15:01,029
(Someone is watching Ji Hyo.)

2140
01:15:01,029 --> 01:15:03,845
(It's Jong Kook in a normal outfit.)

2141
01:15:04,169 --> 01:15:06,774
(When Jong Kook asks the audience to shout,)

2142
01:15:06,869 --> 01:15:09,715
(the audience responds with a big shout.)

2143
01:15:10,169 --> 01:15:12,669
- They shouted. - Everyone shouted.

2144
01:15:12,669 --> 01:15:15,680
(Well-dressed Jong Kook takes care of Ji Hyo.)

2145
01:15:15,680 --> 01:15:17,954
(It's not yet.)

2146
01:15:18,480 --> 01:15:21,324
(Ji Hyo goes on stage when Jong Kook gives a sign.)

2147
01:15:26,820 --> 01:15:30,704
(Ji Hyo is calm due to the audience's welcoming shout.)

2148
01:15:31,159 --> 01:15:33,704
(Ji Hyo's looks put them in awe.)

2149
01:15:33,999 --> 01:15:36,574
(The main vocalist of Running Man appears.)

2150
01:15:39,970 --> 01:15:42,375
(You're the only one for me)

2151
01:15:47,409 --> 01:15:48,614
(Thank you.)

2152
01:15:49,610 --> 01:15:52,125
(He acts rashly as he's excited.)

2153
01:15:52,709 --> 01:15:54,050
(Embracing awkward members,)

2154
01:15:54,050 --> 01:15:57,024
(Running Man fans' sincerely shout out.)

2155
01:15:59,820 --> 01:16:02,295
(After the first verse)

2156
01:16:03,659 --> 01:16:07,604
(The audience notices something.)

2157
01:16:10,730 --> 01:16:13,574
(Prisoner number 1, Jae Seok appears.)

2158
01:16:13,669 --> 01:16:16,074
(How is Jae Seok the only one wearing prison uniform?)

2159
01:16:16,300 --> 01:16:18,244
1, 2, 3.

2160
01:16:18,409 --> 01:16:20,555
(Silence)

2161
01:16:21,079 --> 01:16:22,140
Goodness.

2162
01:16:22,140 --> 01:16:23,379
(The audience knows what's fun.)

2163
01:16:23,379 --> 01:16:25,310
(They agreed in advance to be silent.)

2164
01:16:25,310 --> 01:16:27,725
(They're genuine laugh chasers.)

2165
01:16:28,150 --> 01:16:29,824
Wait.

2166
01:16:30,119 --> 01:16:31,694
We didn't hear anything.

2167
01:16:32,419 --> 01:16:34,119
(He was picked by the audience.)

2168
01:16:34,119 --> 01:16:37,064
(He becomes the main member today.)

2169
01:16:38,260 --> 01:16:41,935
(He's posing after losing his outfit.)

2170
01:16:42,600 --> 01:16:45,404
(The audience is very satisfied.)

2171
01:16:46,739 --> 01:16:48,774
(He pretends to be sweet.)

2172
01:16:50,209 --> 01:16:52,944
(Yu Jae Seok, you're so sexy.)

2173
01:16:53,640 --> 01:16:55,885
(Se Chan appears next.)

2174
01:17:01,449 --> 01:17:04,324
(Cuteness)

2175
01:17:04,390 --> 01:17:06,125
- You were singing so hard. - Pardon?

2176
01:17:06,190 --> 01:17:07,635
You were singing so hard.

2177
01:17:08,459 --> 01:17:09,489
(Is Kwang Soo being more hardworking than normal?)

2178
01:17:09,489 --> 01:17:11,305
You weren't like that before.

2179
01:17:12,360 --> 01:17:13,400
I feel like vomiting.

2180
01:17:13,400 --> 01:17:14,805
It's not because I'm a spy.

2181
01:17:15,329 --> 01:17:17,005
Isn't Jae Seok a spy?

2182
01:17:17,699 --> 01:17:20,314
(A few of them are being suspected for singing hard.)

2183
01:17:20,339 --> 01:17:23,484
(The part for Frog in Love starts.)

2184
01:17:25,110 --> 01:17:26,239
(Her shoulders are crunched due to nervousness.)

2185
01:17:26,239 --> 01:17:28,940
(She makes cheesy gestures.)

2186
01:17:28,940 --> 01:17:31,980
(However, the audience reacts like they're at a concert.)

2187
01:17:31,980 --> 01:17:34,795
(Running Man's eldest member, Seok Jin appears.)

2188
01:17:38,919 --> 01:17:41,635
(It's time for everyone to sing together.)

2189
01:17:43,190 --> 01:17:46,564
- Scream! - Let's go. Scream.

2190
01:18:00,180 --> 01:18:02,154
(You're the only one for me)

2191
01:18:02,480 --> 01:18:05,284
(We say hello after long 9 years.)

2192
01:18:05,550 --> 01:18:08,925
(We're grateful for Running Man fans who greet us with smiles.)

2193
01:18:13,320 --> 01:18:17,204
(We enjoyed every moment over the last 9 years.)

2194
01:18:17,390 --> 01:18:20,675
(Our fans were by our side and laughed with us.)

2195
01:18:26,900 --> 01:18:30,585
(The eight members' hello was awkward yet warm)

2196
01:18:30,669 --> 01:18:32,570
Hello, everyone.

2197
01:18:32,570 --> 01:18:34,784
- Hello. - Hello.

2198
01:18:36,539 --> 01:18:37,625
Thank you.

2199
01:18:37,749 --> 01:18:40,150
Special project for Running Man's ninth year anniversary.

2200
01:18:40,150 --> 01:18:42,850
To those who were with us during Running Man's Fan-Meet,

2201
01:18:42,850 --> 01:18:44,020
I'd like to thank you again with all my heart.

2202
01:18:44,020 --> 01:18:45,925
- Thank you. - Thank you.

2203
01:18:47,890 --> 01:18:49,089
Thank you so much.

2204
01:18:49,089 --> 01:18:50,489
There's a lot of heat from the audience.

2205
01:18:50,489 --> 01:18:52,190
It's really amazing.

2206
01:18:52,190 --> 01:18:55,360
This is just the opening, but for a moment,

2207
01:18:55,360 --> 01:18:56,869
I got teary.

2208
01:18:56,869 --> 01:18:58,369
- By the way, - Also...

2209
01:18:58,369 --> 01:18:59,400
look at your outfit.

2210
01:18:59,400 --> 01:19:00,800
- Look at your outfit. - My outfit?

2211
01:19:00,800 --> 01:19:02,400
(Look at your outfit before getting teary.)

2212
01:19:02,400 --> 01:19:03,739
- What's this? - You should match your outfit.

2213
01:19:03,739 --> 01:19:06,709
The audience welcomed me, so I didn't realize it.

2214
01:19:06,709 --> 01:19:08,909
I won't be able to look at myself on TV.

2215
01:19:08,909 --> 01:19:11,379
I cried a little.

2216
01:19:11,379 --> 01:19:13,255
- Why? - I was moved...

2217
01:19:13,279 --> 01:19:15,579
- by the shout from the audience. - Really?

2218
01:19:15,579 --> 01:19:16,925
(He touches around his eyes.)

2219
01:19:16,949 --> 01:19:19,650
(Everyone pretends to fall for his calculated comment.)

2220
01:19:19,650 --> 01:19:21,360
Stop it. What's wrong with you?

2221
01:19:21,360 --> 01:19:22,959
It's only the start.

2222
01:19:22,959 --> 01:19:25,589
- Why are you starting it already? - Your eyes look clearer than ever.

2223
01:19:25,589 --> 01:19:26,760
Thank you so much.

2224
01:19:26,760 --> 01:19:29,900
Haha will be performing first.

2225
01:19:29,900 --> 01:19:31,430
Please get off the stage first.

2226
01:19:31,430 --> 01:19:33,274
Okay, I'll see you in a moment.

2227
01:19:34,300 --> 01:19:35,545
Yes, man.

2228
01:19:35,570 --> 01:19:38,909
This is our first fan-meet in Korea.

2229
01:19:38,909 --> 01:19:40,680
- It's the first as a variety show. - Right.

2230
01:19:40,680 --> 01:19:41,810
How do you feel?

2231
01:19:41,810 --> 01:19:42,810
Ji Hyo?

2232
01:19:42,810 --> 01:19:43,980
(How does Ji Hyo feel?)

2233
01:19:43,980 --> 01:19:45,654
Hello, I'm Song Ji Hyo.

2234
01:19:45,909 --> 01:19:48,020
(Everyone screams. It's Song Ji Hyo!)

2235
01:19:48,020 --> 01:19:49,654
(She's so pretty.)

2236
01:19:50,320 --> 01:19:54,060
I didn't know that I'd be this nervous.

2237
01:19:54,060 --> 01:19:55,459
- I'm so nervous. - You're so pretty!

2238
01:19:55,459 --> 01:19:56,795
Thank you.

2239
01:19:57,129 --> 01:19:58,935
You're so pretty!

2240
01:19:59,529 --> 01:20:01,159
(She's content.)

2241
01:20:01,159 --> 01:20:03,104
I'm sorry, but do you have a loudspeaker?

2242
01:20:03,199 --> 01:20:04,930
- Did you bring a loudspeaker? - I was so startled.

2243
01:20:04,930 --> 01:20:06,999
- He has a very loud voice. - You're so pretty!

2244
01:20:06,999 --> 01:20:09,539
- I asked him to do it. - Did you?

2245
01:20:09,539 --> 01:20:11,470
Next is So Min.

2246
01:20:11,470 --> 01:20:13,585
Hello, I'm Jeon So Min.

2247
01:20:13,709 --> 01:20:16,180
(The audience shouts as soon as she says hello.)

2248
01:20:16,180 --> 01:20:20,150
Finally, today is here.

2249
01:20:20,150 --> 01:20:23,789
I hope that it will be unforgettable today.

2250
01:20:23,789 --> 01:20:26,095
It'll also stay in my memory.

2251
01:20:26,190 --> 01:20:28,494
Please enjoy!

2252
01:20:28,890 --> 01:20:31,190
(The audience responds with a big shout.)

2253
01:20:31,190 --> 01:20:32,459
You were about to cry.

2254
01:20:32,459 --> 01:20:33,730
Did you get teary?

2255
01:20:33,730 --> 01:20:35,300
- I'm very nervous. - Right.

2256
01:20:35,300 --> 01:20:36,360
My hands are trembling.

2257
01:20:36,360 --> 01:20:39,430
I looked at our outfits on the screen.

2258
01:20:39,430 --> 01:20:40,839
I'll be hosting the show today...

2259
01:20:40,839 --> 01:20:42,239
Yours is the worst.

2260
01:20:42,239 --> 01:20:44,770
(A group of 7 members and one host)

2261
01:20:44,770 --> 01:20:47,810
Did you come here as an MC?

2262
01:20:47,810 --> 01:20:50,015
(Based on his outfit, he looks like an MC.)

2263
01:20:50,610 --> 01:20:52,510
- As an MC. - I was imprisoned but...

2264
01:20:52,510 --> 01:20:55,749
- released temporarily to host. - Right.

2265
01:20:55,749 --> 01:20:57,850
I'm here to host your fan-meet.

2266
01:20:57,850 --> 01:20:59,949
Many of you are here...

2267
01:20:59,949 --> 01:21:02,564
to be with us on our fan-meet.

2268
01:21:02,589 --> 01:21:05,159
As I told you before,

2269
01:21:05,159 --> 01:21:08,129
please exert energy with us until you sweat.

2270
01:21:08,129 --> 01:21:09,430
Everyone, are you ready?

2271
01:21:09,430 --> 01:21:11,400
(Yes, we're ready.)

2272
01:21:11,400 --> 01:21:13,470
With your expectations and support,

2273
01:21:13,470 --> 01:21:15,169
we'll start the performance.

2274
01:21:15,169 --> 01:21:17,169
Seok Jin will...

2275
01:21:17,169 --> 01:21:19,244
announce the start.

2276
01:21:19,310 --> 01:21:21,654
(We can't believe that we'll hear this live.)

2277
01:21:22,440 --> 01:21:24,279
