1
00:00:54,020 --> 00:00:56,970
I'm sorry.
Can you turn around for a bit? Yes.

2
00:00:59,390 --> 00:01:02,080
That's funny.
You want me to turn around?

3
00:01:02,080 --> 00:01:04,630
- Yes.
- Could you turn around?

4
00:01:04,630 --> 00:01:06,720
- Hello. Excuse me for interrupting.
- Hey.

5
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:08,360
(Excuse me for interrupting.)

6
00:01:08,360 --> 00:01:09,930
I'll just change the light bulb.

7
00:01:09,930 --> 00:01:11,230
- You need to change the light bulb?
- Yes.

8
00:01:11,230 --> 00:01:12,660
All of a sudden?
We're in the middle of a meeting.

9
00:01:12,660 --> 00:01:14,790
The light bulbs are fine.
But you're going to change them?

10
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,840
(Jong Kook starts crying
to avoid laughing.)

11
00:01:16,840 --> 00:01:19,230
- We should watch him.
- We ought to.

12
00:01:19,230 --> 00:01:21,880
(The moment you watch it,
you cannot stop laughing.)

13
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:23,910
(A strong aura
of his skit tell them...)

14
00:01:23,910 --> 00:01:25,610
(it will be impossible
not to laugh at his skit.)

15
00:01:26,270 --> 00:01:28,310
(They must play fair
and not avoid watching his skit.)

16
00:01:28,310 --> 00:01:29,840
- We have to watch.
- You need to watch him.

17
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:32,090
- Something might fall. Watch.
- We have to watch him.

18
00:01:32,210 --> 00:01:33,650
- He's switching the bulb.
- All right.

19
00:01:33,650 --> 00:01:36,810
- Let me see.
- You need to watch him.

20
00:01:36,810 --> 00:01:38,380
(My goodness!)

21
00:01:38,380 --> 00:01:40,730
- You can't close your eyes.
- Something might fall.

22
00:01:40,730 --> 00:01:42,130
(Pounding)

23
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:44,830
(Five colored toes)

24
00:01:45,230 --> 00:01:46,230
(Wriggling his toes)

25
00:01:46,230 --> 00:01:47,530
Let me see.

26
00:01:48,440 --> 00:01:52,130
(Laughing)

27
00:01:52,130 --> 00:01:54,880
(Since he laughed,
he'll do the penalty.)

28
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:57,170
(He's in a big crisis as well.)

29
00:01:57,410 --> 00:01:58,570
- Look at his socks.
- My gosh.

30
00:01:58,570 --> 00:01:59,710
(Guiding them through the skit)

31
00:01:59,710 --> 00:02:02,680
(What have I just witnessed?)

32
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:05,410
(His taste in socks
is quite a shock.)

33
00:02:05,410 --> 00:02:06,540
My goodness.

34
00:02:06,540 --> 00:02:09,090
(At that moment,
Ji Hyo comes back in disguise.)

35
00:02:09,090 --> 00:02:10,560
- Why isn't this working?
- We tightened it.

36
00:02:10,590 --> 00:02:12,990
Darn it. It's not working.
Why can't I get it out?

37
00:02:13,090 --> 00:02:15,020
(Taking off his jacket)

38
00:02:15,730 --> 00:02:17,290
(Shocked)

39
00:02:17,370 --> 00:02:19,430
(Surprised)

40
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:20,520
(His belly button looks like
a huge Korean melon.)

41
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:22,040
(Slopping)

42
00:02:25,660 --> 00:02:26,900
Hey, you have to watch him.

43
00:02:27,210 --> 00:02:28,930
- Did you see his belly button?
- I did.

44
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:30,870
(Another unexpected side
of an ordinary-looking mechanic)

45
00:02:30,870 --> 00:02:32,180
His belly button looks like
a Korean melon.

46
00:02:32,180 --> 00:02:33,350
(Sloshing)

47
00:02:33,350 --> 00:02:34,540
Isn't that a steamed bun?

48
00:02:35,180 --> 00:02:36,620
Jae Suk laughed too.

49
00:02:36,820 --> 00:02:39,450
- Jae Suk, you're out again.
- I didn't laugh.

50
00:02:40,010 --> 00:02:41,960
(Staring)

51
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:43,880
Is that a garlic clove
on your belly button?

52
00:02:45,020 --> 00:02:46,850
Is that the garlic clove
on your belly button?

53
00:02:46,850 --> 00:02:48,560
(Is that the garlic clove
on your belly button?)

54
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:49,650
- Eun Soo, you're out.
- My gosh.

55
00:02:49,650 --> 00:02:51,100
(I thought
it looked like a Korean melon.)

56
00:02:51,100 --> 00:02:52,900
Isn't that a mushroom?

57
00:02:52,900 --> 00:02:54,040
- Garlic clove.
- No?

58
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:55,570
- My daughter likes it.
- Isn't that a mushroom?

59
00:02:56,870 --> 00:03:00,310
(The garlic comment crushed her.
Eun Soo will carry out the penalty.)

60
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:02,640
- Have a good day.
- Okay.

61
00:03:02,710 --> 00:03:03,770
- Bye.
- Bye.

62
00:03:03,770 --> 00:03:05,770
My gosh, that didn't work.

63
00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:07,680
So what will you do
with the water slap?

64
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:09,240
- Yes, how will you do it?
- Shall we keep going?

65
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:10,940
Yes. Since we're on the subject,
let's do it.

66
00:03:11,590 --> 00:03:13,050
To tell you the truth, we should...

67
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:15,520
be doing this with the new producer,
Jae Suk, but he keeps on...

68
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:16,990
(The new producer, Jae Suk,
enters with the penalty disguise.)

69
00:03:16,990 --> 00:03:19,780
(Holding his breath)

70
00:03:22,930 --> 00:03:24,020
I'm the director.

71
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:26,120
(A blond director from abroad)

72
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:27,270
He's the director.

73
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:28,490
Hello.

74
00:03:28,490 --> 00:03:29,770
(He just looks like a llama
from the US.)

75
00:03:30,460 --> 00:03:32,400
(Bursting into laughter)

76
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:33,900
- Jinyoung, you're out.
- Were you having a meeting?

77
00:03:33,900 --> 00:03:35,030
- We were having a meeting.
- Yes.

78
00:03:35,030 --> 00:03:38,550
They said water slaps were boring,
so we're coming up with new ideas.

79
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:41,180
(Waddling)

80
00:03:41,180 --> 00:03:43,550
- Putting on a disguise...
- It's hard.

81
00:03:44,940 --> 00:03:47,650
Things aren't going too well.
Let's give a big hand for everyone.

82
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:51,150
(The llama has
the biggest front paws.)

83
00:03:51,150 --> 00:03:52,960
(Clapping)

84
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:54,650
(Why is the American llama
clapping?)

85
00:03:54,650 --> 00:03:55,800
All right.

86
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:56,930
(Let's keep my mouth shut.)

87
00:03:57,150 --> 00:03:58,930
(I must hold out.)

88
00:03:58,930 --> 00:04:02,370
(Knocking)

89
00:04:02,370 --> 00:04:04,140
(Who is it?)

90
00:04:04,140 --> 00:04:05,930
- Yes?
- Who is it?

91
00:04:05,930 --> 00:04:07,530
- Someone is here again.
- Come on in.

92
00:04:07,530 --> 00:04:08,930
(Who is the guest
visiting the production crew?)

93
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,370
- Do we have a guest?
- My gosh.

94
00:04:12,370 --> 00:04:15,120
Hello,
I'm a newly appointed director.

95
00:04:17,240 --> 00:04:20,150
Hello,
I'm a newly appointed director.

96
00:04:20,550 --> 00:04:24,560
(But that blue face seems
somewhat familiar.)

97
00:04:24,750 --> 00:04:26,120
Well, she's...

98
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:27,690
the fish-shaped bun seller.

99
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:31,900
Have some fish-shaped buns.

100
00:04:31,990 --> 00:04:34,560
(Lady Yondu tried to sell the buns
as if her blue face is nothing new.)

101
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:37,340
(Do you want choux cream flavor
or red bean flavor?)

102
00:04:38,530 --> 00:04:39,840
(Are you a lady?)

103
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:41,740
(Yes.)

104
00:04:41,740 --> 00:04:43,110
(Thanks to her determination...)

105
00:04:43,110 --> 00:04:46,550
(as fish-shaped bun seller,
she was appointed as the director.)

106
00:04:47,580 --> 00:04:51,550
(They are about to crack up
at the memory of the bun seller.)

107
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:54,420
(Laughing)

108
00:04:54,420 --> 00:04:55,680
So Min, you're out.

109
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:56,920
(So Min's laughter is spotted.)

110
00:04:56,920 --> 00:04:58,860
(Looking invincible)

111
00:04:58,860 --> 00:05:02,800
It looks like the TV ratings are
going up a lot these days. Right?

112
00:05:03,330 --> 00:05:05,490
(Laughing)

113
00:05:05,770 --> 00:05:07,560
It's my first time seeing her
in person. I'm a fan.

114
00:05:07,930 --> 00:05:09,740
I'm your fan. I saw you on TV.

115
00:05:09,830 --> 00:05:10,970
- But...
- The fish-shaped bun seller.

116
00:05:11,810 --> 00:05:13,260
- I'm a fan.
- Oh, no.

117
00:05:13,260 --> 00:05:15,500
I guess you never know
what lies ahead in life.

118
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:17,740
Well, I'm your fan.

119
00:05:17,740 --> 00:05:18,870
I want to watch her a little more.

120
00:05:18,870 --> 00:05:20,110
- I'm your fan.
- I'm a huge fan.

121
00:05:20,110 --> 00:05:22,010
(Nasal flaring)

122
00:05:22,010 --> 00:05:23,010
(Shutting his eyes)

123
00:05:23,010 --> 00:05:24,620
I'm your fan.

124
00:05:24,620 --> 00:05:25,640
(Farting)

125
00:05:25,640 --> 00:05:27,310
- Nice to meet you.
- Are you a director?

126
00:05:27,310 --> 00:05:29,220
I'm your fan.

127
00:05:29,510 --> 00:05:30,620
(What just happened?)

128
00:05:30,620 --> 00:05:32,680
- Are you a director?
- Yes, I'm a director.

129
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:34,300
(She keeps farting
when everyone is flustered.)

130
00:05:34,300 --> 00:05:36,820
- Why...
- She keeps farting.

131
00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:38,470
Gosh, I...

132
00:05:39,100 --> 00:05:40,600
(I think I heard...)

133
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:41,970
She keeps farting.

134
00:05:42,830 --> 00:05:45,170
- Gosh, I have indigestion.
- Eun Soo is out.

135
00:05:45,760 --> 00:05:48,280
- I'm sorry.
- Why do you keep farting?

136
00:05:48,910 --> 00:05:50,500
That's enough to take a dump.

137
00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:53,810
(That's enough to take a dump.)

138
00:05:53,810 --> 00:05:56,050
(Trying hard not to laugh)

139
00:05:57,240 --> 00:05:59,180
(He can't hold in his laughter.)

140
00:05:59,180 --> 00:06:00,350
That's so unexpected.

141
00:06:00,950 --> 00:06:02,180
Who?

142
00:06:02,180 --> 00:06:03,450
(Jae Suk will carry out
the penalty.)

143
00:06:03,790 --> 00:06:06,230
It's just that I have indigestion.

144
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:07,660
I'm sorry.

145
00:06:07,950 --> 00:06:09,320
Bye, ma'am.

146
00:06:09,450 --> 00:06:10,600
- Thank you.
- Bye.

147
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:11,800
- We'll do our best.
- Bye, ma'am.

148
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:13,190
Please remember me.

149
00:06:13,190 --> 00:06:14,470
(Director, please get better.)

150
00:06:14,470 --> 00:06:15,600
The fish-shaped bun seller.

151
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:17,170
(Knocking)

152
00:06:17,170 --> 00:06:18,260
Wait. Someone is here.

153
00:06:18,260 --> 00:06:20,670
(Wait. Someone is here.)

154
00:06:20,930 --> 00:06:21,980
Hello.

155
00:06:22,540 --> 00:06:23,930
- My gosh. Hello.
- What brings you here?

156
00:06:23,930 --> 00:06:25,480
- He's an anchor.
- Hello.

157
00:06:26,180 --> 00:06:28,010
(The official voice actor
of the show, Kim Yoon Sang)

158
00:06:28,010 --> 00:06:29,870
- I'm here on behalf of anchors.
- Coffee.

159
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:32,550
(He visited the production crew
with beverages.)

160
00:06:32,550 --> 00:06:34,080
- Coffee. My gosh.
- Hello.

161
00:06:34,450 --> 00:06:35,860
(Surprised)

162
00:06:35,860 --> 00:06:37,250
- What brings you here?
- Isn't that Yoon Sang?

163
00:06:37,750 --> 00:06:40,080
- I heard you were having a meeting.
- You really came to see us?

164
00:06:40,230 --> 00:06:41,750
- I'm here on behalf of anchors.
- Really?

165
00:06:41,860 --> 00:06:42,930
Thank you.

166
00:06:42,930 --> 00:06:45,260
- My goodness. Really?
- He's a handsome anchor.

167
00:06:45,260 --> 00:06:46,730
- I'm Yoon Sang. Hello.
- Hi.

168
00:06:46,730 --> 00:06:48,760
- What's up with your makeup?
- Thank you.

169
00:06:49,470 --> 00:06:52,130
(Opening the lid)

170
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:57,410
Wait, this isn't coffee.

171
00:06:57,410 --> 00:06:58,610
This is beef radish soup.

172
00:07:00,610 --> 00:07:02,870
- Wait, this isn't coffee.
- This tastes...

173
00:07:02,870 --> 00:07:04,050
This is beef radish soup.

174
00:07:04,050 --> 00:07:05,740
This tastes weird.

175
00:07:05,740 --> 00:07:06,940
(Laughing)

176
00:07:06,940 --> 00:07:08,360
It's beef radish soup.

177
00:07:09,510 --> 00:07:12,250
(Dripping)

178
00:07:13,030 --> 00:07:14,730
You should have brought
instant rice too.

179
00:07:15,300 --> 00:07:17,300
- I like mine cold.
- You can ask for that.

180
00:07:17,690 --> 00:07:19,030
- You should've brought rice.
- You're out too.

181
00:07:19,030 --> 00:07:20,620
- I know the flavor, but it's weird.
- There's one with rice.

182
00:07:20,620 --> 00:07:22,670
- I know this dish, but it's odd.
- You should've brought rice.

183
00:07:22,760 --> 00:07:24,700
Beef radish soup
is my favorite dish.

184
00:07:25,430 --> 00:07:26,540
It's so good.

185
00:07:26,610 --> 00:07:28,070
How could you put it
in the coffee cup?

186
00:07:28,280 --> 00:07:30,330
- Enjoy your food.
- How could you bring it here?

187
00:07:30,780 --> 00:07:32,180
- Thank you.
- Is it good?

188
00:07:32,780 --> 00:07:34,920
I really didn't see that one coming.

189
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:36,280
Seriously. The beef radish soup.

190
00:07:36,280 --> 00:07:37,920
- When I opened it, I was shocked.
- I was so shocked.

191
00:07:38,380 --> 00:07:40,990
It's my first time craving kimchi
while holding the coffee cup.

192
00:07:41,750 --> 00:07:42,810
(Laughing)

193
00:07:42,810 --> 00:07:44,860
(Strangely, I'm craving kimchi.)

194
00:07:44,860 --> 00:07:46,750
(Laughing)

195
00:07:46,750 --> 00:07:49,560
(Thinking about sad things)

196
00:07:50,060 --> 00:07:52,170
- Why do I crave kimchi so much?
- My gosh, Suk Jin.

197
00:07:52,170 --> 00:07:53,320
(Haha will carry out the penalty.)

198
00:07:53,760 --> 00:07:55,040
(Gazing)

199
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:56,260
Jinyoung, you look good...

200
00:07:56,670 --> 00:07:58,470
- even with that on.
- Right.

201
00:07:58,810 --> 00:08:00,910
- You're the best-looking guy here.
- I want to live for a week...

202
00:08:00,910 --> 00:08:02,410
- with his face.
- I don't have any disguise on.

203
00:08:02,410 --> 00:08:03,680
- What?
- I don't have any disguise on.

204
00:08:03,810 --> 00:08:04,850
You don't?

205
00:08:05,910 --> 00:08:08,070
(I don't have any disguise on.)

206
00:08:08,070 --> 00:08:10,070
(Jinyoung with the beggar disguise
is better-looking than Se Chan.)

207
00:08:10,070 --> 00:08:11,240
- Didn't you put on a disguise?
- No, I don't.

208
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:12,510
No, I don't have a disguise on.

209
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:14,990
- I don't have a disguise on.
- Go. You laughed.

210
00:08:14,990 --> 00:08:16,010
- You don't?
- No.

211
00:08:16,010 --> 00:08:17,950
- Really? I thought you did.
- Aren't you on the same team?

212
00:08:18,250 --> 00:08:19,880
- What is this? Jae Suk.
- Is he in my team?

213
00:08:20,580 --> 00:08:23,360
(And at that time...)

214
00:08:24,030 --> 00:08:26,690
- This beef radish soup is great.
- It's really good.

215
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:30,430
(Surprised)

216
00:08:34,310 --> 00:08:38,240
(The Tape Surgery
over the tip of his nose and lips)

217
00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:42,620
(Laughing)

218
00:08:42,620 --> 00:08:45,080
(Drinking the beef radish soup
without any hesitation)

219
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:47,380
- What's happening?
- Suk Jin, you're out.

220
00:08:48,920 --> 00:08:51,820
(The beef radish soup
keeps dripping.)

221
00:08:52,750 --> 00:08:56,660
Did you get a Botox injection
on your lips?

222
00:08:57,620 --> 00:08:59,230
(Plump lips)

223
00:08:59,430 --> 00:09:00,820
(Trying not to laugh)

224
00:09:02,170 --> 00:09:05,000
He does that every time,
but it's still funny.

225
00:09:05,110 --> 00:09:06,560
- What's going on?
- Seriously.

226
00:09:07,260 --> 00:09:08,410
What's up with my lips?

227
00:09:08,700 --> 00:09:10,430
I want to buy his face.

228
00:09:10,430 --> 00:09:11,850
(A comedian's point of view)

229
00:09:11,850 --> 00:09:13,680
If I attempt to do something,

230
00:09:13,780 --> 00:09:15,620
I'm worried I might laugh
at my own skit.

231
00:09:15,620 --> 00:09:17,920
- By the way,
- That could happen.

232
00:09:18,050 --> 00:09:19,080
- were you guys doing well?
- Yes.

233
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:21,160
(Kyung Hwan comes back
with his penalty disguise.)

234
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:22,920
(Staring)

235
00:09:23,860 --> 00:09:25,160
Had I known this is
what we'd be doing...

236
00:09:25,230 --> 00:09:27,850
Your disguise isn't that funny
given you're a comedian.

237
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:28,900
Right.

238
00:09:30,630 --> 00:09:32,670
(Your disguise isn't that funny
given you're a comedian.)

239
00:09:33,300 --> 00:09:34,460
Kyung Hwan, you're out.

240
00:09:34,460 --> 00:09:36,640
(He's kicked out
within 1 second of sitting down.)

241
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:38,200
(Jae Suk laughs after making
a brutally honest comment.)

242
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:39,360
Jae Suk, you're out.

243
00:09:39,700 --> 00:09:41,910
Darn it.
I'm out because of Kyung Hwan.

244
00:09:42,180 --> 00:09:44,010
It's all because of Kyung Hwan.

245
00:09:44,700 --> 00:09:47,510
- Hello, producers.
- Hello.

246
00:09:47,650 --> 00:09:49,150
(Another guest
has visited the crew.)

247
00:09:49,150 --> 00:09:51,310
- Hello.
- Hi.

248
00:09:51,310 --> 00:09:53,110
- My gosh.
- I'm a CEO of a label.

249
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:55,810
- I want to introduce a new singer.
- I see.

250
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:57,720
- Hold on.
- Okay.

251
00:09:57,720 --> 00:09:59,790
(The surprise guest
is the CEO of a label.)

252
00:09:59,890 --> 00:10:01,690
Wait. Give me a second.
He's over there.

253
00:10:02,500 --> 00:10:05,220
I get the feeling
that she's the singer.

254
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:07,900
(Screaming)

255
00:10:10,930 --> 00:10:11,960
Ta-da.

256
00:10:12,670 --> 00:10:15,310
- I bet it's her.
- No. I'm sorry.

257
00:10:15,310 --> 00:10:17,970
(A man shows up with a group
of high school girls. Who is he?)

258
00:10:17,970 --> 00:10:19,150
Great.

259
00:10:22,970 --> 00:10:26,080
(He'll make the production crew
of "Dalim Man" laugh.)

260
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:28,350
(It's Han Gi Beom.)

261
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:31,220
(A huge mosquito bit me)

262
00:10:31,220 --> 00:10:32,680
(It was itchy)

263
00:10:32,680 --> 00:10:34,060
(The moment you see his eyes,
you can't hold it in.)

264
00:10:34,060 --> 00:10:35,900
(As soon as he makes a move,
everyone is bound to laugh.)

265
00:10:35,900 --> 00:10:38,690
(The ultimate killer of laughter
is back.)

266
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:40,960
Ta-da.

267
00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:42,800
(As the ultimate king enters,)

268
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:44,960
(they bow down at a 90-degree angle
to welcome him.)

269
00:10:44,960 --> 00:10:47,560
(Kneeling down to ask
for forgiveness of their negligence)

270
00:10:48,930 --> 00:10:50,140
(As he's about to laugh,)

271
00:10:50,140 --> 00:10:52,470
(he asks for help from the staff.)

272
00:10:52,470 --> 00:10:55,840
(A simple method is the best.
I'm not going to watch that.)

273
00:10:55,840 --> 00:10:59,890
(His appearance is enough
to make everyone laugh.)

274
00:11:00,610 --> 00:11:02,420
This is cheating!

275
00:11:03,660 --> 00:11:05,850
Let me introduce my singers
to you first.

276
00:11:05,890 --> 00:11:06,980
- Okay.
- Okay.

277
00:11:07,480 --> 00:11:09,320
In 1, 2, 3.

278
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:12,860
- Hello, we're Han's Band.
- Hello, we're Han's Band.

279
00:11:12,860 --> 00:11:17,640
(Hello, we're Han's Band.)

280
00:11:18,540 --> 00:11:20,010
In 1, 2, 3.

281
00:11:20,270 --> 00:11:21,600
(Sounding cheerful)

282
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:24,200
(Hello, we're Han's Band.)

283
00:11:24,230 --> 00:11:26,780
(Gi Beom, what are you doing?)

284
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:28,180
- This is amazing.
- My goodness.

285
00:11:28,180 --> 00:11:30,520
- Let me watch the skit before I go.
- Hello.

286
00:11:30,570 --> 00:11:33,180
I'm the main vocalist
and the leader.

287
00:11:33,180 --> 00:11:35,980
- I'm Nose Hair, Han Byeol.
- Right.

288
00:11:35,980 --> 00:11:38,160
- Han Byeol. Right.
- She was Nose Hair.

289
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:39,290
Hello.

290
00:11:39,390 --> 00:11:41,760
I'm the Middle Hair of the team.

291
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:44,060
(I'm the Middle Hair of the team.)

292
00:11:44,060 --> 00:11:45,690
(Laughing)

293
00:11:45,690 --> 00:11:48,060
(He probably wanted to say
he was the center.)

294
00:11:48,060 --> 00:11:50,090
I'm the center of the national team,
Han Gi Beom.

295
00:11:51,170 --> 00:11:53,540
(Why did he do a cute act
all of a sudden?)

296
00:11:53,540 --> 00:11:54,930
- He's the center.
- Right.

297
00:11:56,200 --> 00:12:00,280
Hello,
I am the unrivaled vocal...

298
00:12:00,440 --> 00:12:02,940
I'm in charge of being
the main dancer.

299
00:12:04,250 --> 00:12:07,440
(Stuttering)

300
00:12:07,520 --> 00:12:08,950
(Laughing)

301
00:12:08,950 --> 00:12:10,680
I'm in charge of being
the main dancer.

302
00:12:10,680 --> 00:12:12,180
- You're in charge of many things.
- I'm the armpit...

303
00:12:12,180 --> 00:12:14,350
(You're in charge of many things.)

304
00:12:14,760 --> 00:12:16,350
I'm in charge of being
the main dancer.

305
00:12:16,350 --> 00:12:17,960
- You're in charge of many things.
- I'm the armpit...

306
00:12:18,030 --> 00:12:19,670
She keeps smelling her armpit.

307
00:12:19,670 --> 00:12:21,090
Why does she stutter so much?

308
00:12:21,090 --> 00:12:23,770
(They have unspecified roles
in the group.)

309
00:12:23,770 --> 00:12:26,040
They've prepared their title song.

310
00:12:26,040 --> 00:12:27,360
- Okay.
- All right.

311
00:12:28,040 --> 00:12:30,730
(Han's Band's title song
will be revealed.)

312
00:12:30,730 --> 00:12:32,700
1, 2, 3, 4!

313
00:12:33,050 --> 00:12:35,650
(With Middle Hair in the group,)

314
00:12:35,750 --> 00:12:39,180
(how will their song turn out?)

315
00:12:39,390 --> 00:12:42,160
(Don't tease me for being young)

316
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:43,480
Who teased you?

317
00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:46,320
(Don't tease me for being young)

318
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:48,000
Who teased you?

319
00:12:48,930 --> 00:12:50,000
Who teased him?

320
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,320
(Gi Beom was born in 1964.)

321
00:12:51,630 --> 00:12:52,770
Who teased him?

322
00:12:54,090 --> 00:12:56,090
(Did you have to go this far?)

323
00:12:56,090 --> 00:12:58,060
- Gosh.
- Why are you doing this?

324
00:12:58,060 --> 00:13:01,680
(He doesn't know the lyrics.)

325
00:13:01,830 --> 00:13:03,100
- Stop.
- I can't hold back.

326
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:05,010
- Stop it, please.
- I just can't.

327
00:13:05,010 --> 00:13:06,440
Please stop, Gi Beom.

328
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:08,150
Stop.

329
00:13:08,750 --> 00:13:10,250
- Please cast them.
- All right.

330
00:13:10,250 --> 00:13:11,710
- Thank you.
- We will.

331
00:13:11,710 --> 00:13:12,940
Thank you.

332
00:13:13,150 --> 00:13:15,020
- Thank you.
- Goodbye!

333
00:13:15,020 --> 00:13:16,560
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

334
00:13:16,710 --> 00:13:19,160
They were awesome.

335
00:13:19,160 --> 00:13:20,580
Round one is complete.

336
00:13:20,580 --> 00:13:22,690
It's impossible not to laugh.

337
00:13:22,690 --> 00:13:24,350
- Just imagining it is hilarious.
- That was hilarious.

338
00:13:24,350 --> 00:13:28,060
Team Producer laughed 15 times.

339
00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:29,730
That's not that much.

340
00:13:29,730 --> 00:13:32,140
Team Writer laughed 11 times.

341
00:13:33,060 --> 00:13:34,060
What a relief.

342
00:13:34,060 --> 00:13:36,470
Team New Producer laughed 27 times.

343
00:13:37,910 --> 00:13:40,310
We're weak when it comes
to things like this.

344
00:13:40,310 --> 00:13:42,880
Team Writer wins this round.

345
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:45,790
(Team Writer wins.)

346
00:13:49,160 --> 00:13:51,980
(The main producer,
assistant director,)

347
00:13:51,980 --> 00:13:54,450
(Coughing Ghost, and
Clacking Ghost are among them.)

348
00:13:54,450 --> 00:13:56,530
(The winning team
may pick one team...)

349
00:13:56,530 --> 00:14:00,190
(and find out how many members
of that team are ghosts.)

350
00:14:00,590 --> 00:14:03,960
- Which team? It doesn't matter.
- I think...

351
00:14:03,960 --> 00:14:06,010
- How about Jae Suk's team?
- Team New Producer?

352
00:14:06,010 --> 00:14:07,600
Yes.

353
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:09,330
They're competent.

354
00:14:09,330 --> 00:14:10,930
- We pick Team New Producer.
- We pick Team New Producer.

355
00:14:10,930 --> 00:14:15,050
The number of ghosts
in that team is...

356
00:14:15,050 --> 00:14:19,310
(Will there be ghosts in that team?)

357
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:21,760
- None.
- What?

358
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:24,350
(There are none.)

359
00:14:24,350 --> 00:14:26,850
- There are none?
- There are none?

360
00:14:28,260 --> 00:14:30,690
It makes no sense.

361
00:14:30,690 --> 00:14:32,630
- They're everywhere but there.
- Right.

362
00:14:32,630 --> 00:14:34,000
This is fishy.

363
00:14:34,590 --> 00:14:35,860
Was the result shocking?

364
00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:38,200
- It's a bit tricky.
- It's a bit difficult.

365
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:39,410
- Which team did you pick?
- Which team?

366
00:14:39,410 --> 00:14:40,770
We can't reveal that.

367
00:14:40,770 --> 00:14:42,410
It's tricky.

368
00:14:42,410 --> 00:14:44,230
But it's fishy.

369
00:14:44,230 --> 00:14:46,750
- Are half of the members ghosts?
- It's confusing.

370
00:14:46,910 --> 00:14:48,180
The result is confusing.

371
00:14:48,180 --> 00:14:50,280
Please change your uniforms,
and let's move onto round two.

372
00:14:50,280 --> 00:14:51,310
- Okay.
- Okay.

373
00:14:51,310 --> 00:14:52,980
(They move onto round 2.)

374
00:14:53,840 --> 00:14:55,660
(They arrive
at their next location.)

375
00:14:55,660 --> 00:14:57,520
- Suk Jin is in the toilet.
- I see.

376
00:14:57,610 --> 00:14:59,760
I was wondering why it felt weird.
Suk Jin's not here.

377
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:00,790
We can start without him.

378
00:15:00,790 --> 00:15:02,130
(He wants to start
without Suk Jin.)

379
00:15:02,760 --> 00:15:05,130
(This is how strong
their 9-year friendship is.)

380
00:15:05,130 --> 00:15:08,590
I was surprised
that it felt empty without him.

381
00:15:09,140 --> 00:15:10,500
We can start. It's fine.

382
00:15:11,510 --> 00:15:12,770
Let's clap for him.

383
00:15:12,830 --> 00:15:14,230
I was checking my phone.

384
00:15:14,230 --> 00:15:15,230
(He returns.)

385
00:15:15,230 --> 00:15:16,510
- Suk Jin.
- What? Why are you clapping?

386
00:15:16,510 --> 00:15:18,070
- I'm relieved.
- Why?

387
00:15:18,440 --> 00:15:21,970
Because you're alive. I'm serious.

388
00:15:21,970 --> 00:15:24,940
Let's be grateful
that he's still here with us.

389
00:15:24,940 --> 00:15:26,110
Gosh.

390
00:15:26,890 --> 00:15:30,110
Here is your second mission
to help determine the two ghosts.

391
00:15:30,110 --> 00:15:33,450
Your entire team needs to pass.
It's called the Song Train.

392
00:15:33,450 --> 00:15:35,160
(Song Train)

393
00:15:35,160 --> 00:15:36,160
What is that?

394
00:15:36,190 --> 00:15:38,500
If you get
3 out of 8 questions right,

395
00:15:38,500 --> 00:15:40,720
- we'll give you a hint.
- Okay.

396
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:42,040
- Let's do well.
- It'll be obvious.

397
00:15:42,040 --> 00:15:43,830
- It'll be very obvious.
- Definitely.

398
00:15:43,830 --> 00:15:47,430
Every round will have six people.

399
00:15:47,430 --> 00:15:50,910
You will all be wearing headphones
and will have to deliver...

400
00:15:50,910 --> 00:15:52,810
the dance moves
to the person in front.

401
00:15:52,810 --> 00:15:55,310
The last member needs to guess
the singer and the song.

402
00:15:55,420 --> 00:15:56,970
Please pick the six members.

403
00:15:57,680 --> 00:15:58,680
Six members?

404
00:15:58,680 --> 00:16:00,110
- Then...
- Let's mix them up.

405
00:16:00,250 --> 00:16:02,920
Those in similar age groups
can play rock-paper-scissors and go.

406
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:04,260
Suk Jin will have to play alone.

407
00:16:04,260 --> 00:16:05,720
(That means Suk Jin will be alone.)

408
00:16:05,720 --> 00:16:07,760
(He'll be given an advantage
and will perform folk dance moves.)

409
00:16:07,760 --> 00:16:09,690
This is all that he does.

410
00:16:09,690 --> 00:16:11,690
(Suk Jin has been dancing
the same dance moves...)

411
00:16:11,690 --> 00:16:13,690
(for the past 54 years.)

412
00:16:13,900 --> 00:16:16,330
For this game,

413
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,200
I must participate.

414
00:16:18,200 --> 00:16:20,460
Those who know many old songs
must participate.

415
00:16:20,540 --> 00:16:22,330
Will the six members come up?

416
00:16:22,330 --> 00:16:23,730
It'll be us.

417
00:16:23,730 --> 00:16:25,410
We must get it right.

418
00:16:25,410 --> 00:16:26,650
- Right.
- We need to share the hint.

419
00:16:26,650 --> 00:16:27,680
- But...
- It'll be obvious if you fail.

420
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:30,070
- I'm not sure if there are ghosts.
- I'll suspect any who fails.

421
00:16:30,070 --> 00:16:32,480
- Me too.
- Here we go.

422
00:16:32,940 --> 00:16:34,110
- Get ready.
- Let's do this.

423
00:16:38,450 --> 00:16:40,290
(I know this.)

424
00:16:40,290 --> 00:16:41,590
This is easy...

425
00:16:41,590 --> 00:16:43,130
- because...
- Do you know this?

426
00:16:43,190 --> 00:16:46,190
- You just need to do the body roll.
- Right.

427
00:16:46,400 --> 00:16:47,670
(Which dance move is it?)

428
00:16:47,670 --> 00:16:49,270
If you can't get this,
you'll be suspected right away.

429
00:16:51,730 --> 00:16:53,170
(He pulls the shirt over him
and does the body roll.)

430
00:16:53,170 --> 00:16:54,770
- How will Ri do that?
- That's good.

431
00:16:56,680 --> 00:16:58,750
(It looks a bit disturbing.)

432
00:16:58,750 --> 00:17:00,510
How will she do this?

433
00:17:00,940 --> 00:17:03,210
(How will she pull her shirt over?)

434
00:17:03,210 --> 00:17:04,890
Do another move!

435
00:17:04,890 --> 00:17:06,680
(This body roll is the highlight
of this song.)

436
00:17:07,340 --> 00:17:09,760
("Love Song" by Rain)

437
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:10,920
(Unlike Rain who has great abs,)

438
00:17:10,920 --> 00:17:12,630
(the strap on Haha's waist
is suffocating his waist.)

439
00:17:13,720 --> 00:17:21,190
(Let's watch a bit more
from Rain's performance.)

440
00:17:21,190 --> 00:17:23,730
(Let's watch a bit more
from Haha's performance as well.)

441
00:17:24,230 --> 00:17:25,730
How will she do it?

442
00:17:25,730 --> 00:17:27,510
- That was perfect.
- That was.

443
00:17:27,510 --> 00:17:28,730
(Despite having different physiques,
the moves were exact.)

444
00:17:29,430 --> 00:17:30,700
Don't do it!

445
00:17:30,700 --> 00:17:32,940
(She performs the body roll.)

446
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:34,600
(I got it.)

447
00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:35,970
She's good.

448
00:17:35,970 --> 00:17:37,610
- She got it.
- Good work.

449
00:17:37,610 --> 00:17:39,020
(She uses the skills she got
from traditional dance.)

450
00:17:39,310 --> 00:17:40,440
That's good.

451
00:17:40,610 --> 00:17:43,310
(Will this round be easy?)

452
00:17:43,680 --> 00:17:44,950
(He performs
a different dance move.)

453
00:17:44,950 --> 00:17:46,260
What's wrong with his hip?

454
00:17:46,260 --> 00:17:47,850
- That's a bit...
- That's...

455
00:17:48,630 --> 00:17:50,060
- This is wrong.
- That looks weird.

456
00:17:50,060 --> 00:17:51,130
They're in trouble.

457
00:17:51,800 --> 00:17:53,170
Did you get it?

458
00:17:56,500 --> 00:17:58,510
Why is she dressed
like a grandma underneath?

459
00:17:58,860 --> 00:18:02,400
(It's the 2019
fall and winter look.)

460
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:04,870
- What does she have on?
- She looks like a tower.

461
00:18:04,870 --> 00:18:06,050
(Nonetheless, she undergoes
her mission.)

462
00:18:06,050 --> 00:18:07,480
He got it.

463
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:09,480
She has an electric blanket
wrapped underneath.

464
00:18:10,670 --> 00:18:11,910
An electric blanket?

465
00:18:11,910 --> 00:18:13,020
Did he get it?

466
00:18:13,340 --> 00:18:14,910
(She successfully gets
the job done.)

467
00:18:14,910 --> 00:18:17,310
- Good work.
- He's doing it.

468
00:18:18,420 --> 00:18:19,820
(Did Jong Kook get it right?)

469
00:18:19,820 --> 00:18:20,850
Rain.

470
00:18:20,850 --> 00:18:22,500
(Rain)

471
00:18:22,500 --> 00:18:26,500
(He just needs to get
the song right.)

472
00:18:27,660 --> 00:18:30,440
"Rainism".

473
00:18:30,440 --> 00:18:31,940
- That's not it!
- It's Rain.

474
00:18:31,940 --> 00:18:33,440
Come on!

475
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:35,630
- Jong Kook, did you know?
- Of course, I did.

476
00:18:35,630 --> 00:18:38,170
Gosh. I got the title confused.

477
00:18:38,370 --> 00:18:41,310
- "Rainism" is...
- Those two are very different.

478
00:18:41,310 --> 00:18:43,250
I should've gotten it.

479
00:18:43,720 --> 00:18:45,290
I was sure.

480
00:18:45,880 --> 00:18:48,490
Kyung Hwan and Ji Hyo
shouldn't be next to each other.

481
00:18:48,490 --> 00:18:50,520
Ji Hyo is fine.

482
00:18:50,520 --> 00:18:55,150
- Can you and Ji Hyo switch?
- I'm not a terrible dancer.

483
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,000
No, she did well.

484
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,000
She did well.

485
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,320
- She knew the key points.
- Right.

486
00:19:01,320 --> 00:19:03,040
- It's not about dancing well.
- See that?

487
00:19:03,040 --> 00:19:04,240
- Fine.
- It's about getting the key points.

488
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:05,830
- Here we go.
- Get ready, set, go.

489
00:19:06,710 --> 00:19:09,100
This one is so easy.

490
00:19:10,510 --> 00:19:12,950
("Up and Down" by EXID)

491
00:19:12,950 --> 00:19:15,750
(Everyone knows this dance move.)

492
00:19:16,250 --> 00:19:17,780
If you don't get this,
you're definitely a ghost.

493
00:19:17,780 --> 00:19:19,490
- Definitely.
- You're definitely...

494
00:19:19,490 --> 00:19:21,190
the Clacking Ghost.

495
00:19:22,110 --> 00:19:24,760
(Up, down, up, up, down)

496
00:19:25,690 --> 00:19:28,230
(She recognizes the dance move,)

497
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:30,590
(but it's too provocative.)

498
00:19:30,800 --> 00:19:32,560
(He's into it.)

499
00:19:32,560 --> 00:19:35,440
- It's too provocative.
- They have to get this right.

500
00:19:35,630 --> 00:19:37,560
(Choi Ri shows off her dance moves.)

501
00:19:37,560 --> 00:19:38,710
Okay.

502
00:19:38,710 --> 00:19:39,740
(She dances well...)

503
00:19:39,740 --> 00:19:40,740
(but then suddenly adds to it.)

504
00:19:40,740 --> 00:19:41,940
She's so weird.

505
00:19:41,940 --> 00:19:44,630
Why did you add
your own dance moves to it?

506
00:19:44,780 --> 00:19:46,100
You did it at the beginning!

507
00:19:46,750 --> 00:19:48,280
(Grooving)

508
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:50,340
He's doing it.

509
00:19:51,020 --> 00:19:52,080
What is that?

510
00:19:52,450 --> 00:19:54,080
Why are you overdoing it?

511
00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:55,080
What is that?

512
00:19:55,850 --> 00:19:56,850
Okay.

513
00:19:56,850 --> 00:19:58,760
You got it? This is easy.

514
00:19:58,760 --> 00:20:00,120
They have to get this one right.

515
00:20:01,850 --> 00:20:02,960
(She does it perfectly.)

516
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:04,320
Okay, okay.

517
00:20:04,760 --> 00:20:06,500
She's good.

518
00:20:07,700 --> 00:20:10,590
(Jong Kook's dance moves
are precise as well.)

519
00:20:10,940 --> 00:20:12,510
(However...)

520
00:20:12,510 --> 00:20:13,540
- This is...
- Come on.

521
00:20:13,540 --> 00:20:14,630
- This is easy.
- He got it.

522
00:20:15,010 --> 00:20:16,330
What?

523
00:20:16,330 --> 00:20:17,370
You don't know this?

524
00:20:17,370 --> 00:20:18,780
- What?
- You don't know this?

525
00:20:18,780 --> 00:20:20,250
- You don't know this?
- You should know this one.

526
00:20:20,250 --> 00:20:21,450
- You have to.
- Six...

527
00:20:21,450 --> 00:20:22,750
- Hold on.
- You don't know it?

528
00:20:22,750 --> 00:20:23,870
- Four,
- You don't know this?

529
00:20:23,870 --> 00:20:24,870
- three,
- Don't lie.

530
00:20:24,870 --> 00:20:25,910
- two,
- You need to get this one right.

531
00:20:25,910 --> 00:20:26,950
- one.
- Come on.

532
00:20:27,790 --> 00:20:29,580
This doesn't make sense!
Hold on!

533
00:20:29,580 --> 00:20:31,290
- It's him.
- Are you serious?

534
00:20:31,290 --> 00:20:34,120
- Don't you know this?
- Right! I'm sorry.

535
00:20:34,120 --> 00:20:35,530
Don't lie.

536
00:20:35,530 --> 00:20:37,620
- I'm serious.
- You didn't know that?

537
00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:39,000
It doesn't make sense.

538
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,000
I even performed...

539
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:42,660
- the exact moves.
- This one was obvious.

540
00:20:42,660 --> 00:20:43,970
This was so sudden,

541
00:20:43,970 --> 00:20:46,210
- so I couldn't remember.
- We danced to this before.

542
00:20:46,210 --> 00:20:47,540
- I'm sorry.
- No way.

543
00:20:47,540 --> 00:20:49,100
- Isn't this too obvious?
- I know.

544
00:20:49,100 --> 00:20:51,330
- He's so suspicious.
- He sure is.

545
00:20:51,330 --> 00:20:53,810
- I'm being suspected too much.
- Jae Suk.

546
00:20:53,810 --> 00:20:55,670
- It's seriously not me.
- There's no explanation for this.

547
00:20:55,670 --> 00:20:56,980
Switch places with me.

548
00:20:56,980 --> 00:20:58,610
The ghost wouldn't be
this obvious.

549
00:20:58,610 --> 00:20:59,840
Exactly.

550
00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:01,990
- There are both ghosts.
- They wouldn't be this obvious.

551
00:21:01,990 --> 00:21:03,850
(Did he do this on purpose
so they won't get a hint?)

552
00:21:03,910 --> 00:21:05,260
We could've gotten two more right.

553
00:21:05,260 --> 00:21:07,290
You got all the singers right.

554
00:21:07,290 --> 00:21:08,560
- The questions were...
- We should've gotten...

555
00:21:08,560 --> 00:21:09,820
"Up and Down" and "Love Song"
correct.

556
00:21:09,820 --> 00:21:11,200
- Jae Suk is...
- I was confused.

557
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:12,270
- suspicious.
- Let's do this.

558
00:21:12,270 --> 00:21:13,300
Okay, okay!

559
00:21:13,300 --> 00:21:14,530
- You should be at the end.
- Me?

560
00:21:14,530 --> 00:21:15,630
- Yes.
- You just need to copy,

561
00:21:15,630 --> 00:21:16,740
so So Min, go first.

562
00:21:16,740 --> 00:21:17,940
- Se Chan will guess.
- Se Chan will guess.

563
00:21:17,940 --> 00:21:20,440
- Do you know many songs?
- Yes, more than you.

564
00:21:20,440 --> 00:21:22,670
(Yes, more than you.)

565
00:21:22,940 --> 00:21:24,670
(He doesn't know what to say.)

566
00:21:24,670 --> 00:21:26,280
- That's right.
- Fair enough.

567
00:21:26,280 --> 00:21:27,600
- Then go to the front.
- You're...

568
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:28,720
- You're not flustered, are you?
- You spoke the truth.

569
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:31,570
What's terrifying is that
no matter where Suk Jin is,

570
00:21:31,570 --> 00:21:32,750
it won't work out for him.

571
00:21:32,950 --> 00:21:35,760
- My gosh.
- It doesn't matter where he is.

572
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:39,150
Can you hang up there for a minute?

573
00:21:39,260 --> 00:21:40,320
(He's trying to prevent Suk Jin
from playing.)

574
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:42,620
- Just for a minute. I know you can.
- No.

575
00:21:42,620 --> 00:21:44,730
- I can do well.
- Where will you put him?

576
00:21:44,730 --> 00:21:46,420
What if he ends up leaving?

577
00:21:46,500 --> 00:21:48,740
- What if he does?
- Let's try this first.

578
00:21:49,240 --> 00:21:50,300
(Se Chan suddenly coughs.)

579
00:21:50,300 --> 00:21:51,500
Are you the Coughing Ghost?

580
00:21:52,940 --> 00:21:54,360
(Coughing)

581
00:21:54,900 --> 00:21:56,240
(Why did he suddenly cough?)

582
00:21:56,240 --> 00:21:57,440
I was just coughing.

583
00:21:57,440 --> 00:21:58,950
- Was that a hidden mission?
- I had phlegm...

584
00:21:59,100 --> 00:22:00,510
in my throat.

585
00:22:01,640 --> 00:22:04,280
- Maybe that's his hidden mission.
- I just had a lot of phlegm.

586
00:22:04,670 --> 00:22:05,950
You're the Coughing Ghost.

587
00:22:06,020 --> 00:22:09,080
Ri was the only one
in high heels earlier.

588
00:22:09,460 --> 00:22:11,110
(Coincidentally, she was the only
one wearing heels.)

589
00:22:11,110 --> 00:22:12,150
I saw that too.

590
00:22:12,150 --> 00:22:13,290
Could she be Clacking Ghost?

591
00:22:13,620 --> 00:22:16,090
That's why he coughed
and she had on high heels.

592
00:22:16,090 --> 00:22:18,030
- Coughing...
- Would I be this obvious then?

593
00:22:18,030 --> 00:22:20,030
Actually, you made it seem
quite natural.

594
00:22:20,030 --> 00:22:21,270
- Really?
- Yes

595
00:22:21,270 --> 00:22:23,330
And Suk Jin must be Trickle.

596
00:22:23,330 --> 00:22:25,090
(Another tip-off)

597
00:22:25,540 --> 00:22:27,330
- No way.
- I'm sure of it.

598
00:22:27,330 --> 00:22:28,400
No, I'm Gushing.

599
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:29,710
I went to the restroom
with him, remember?

600
00:22:29,710 --> 00:22:31,780
- He's Drizzle.
- Drizzle?

601
00:22:31,780 --> 00:22:34,310
(Drizzle)

602
00:22:34,310 --> 00:22:35,810
- Gushing.
- No, Drizzle.

603
00:22:35,810 --> 00:22:37,370
- Drizzle.
- Gushing.

604
00:22:37,370 --> 00:22:39,690
- Moving on.
- Let's do better, all right?

605
00:22:39,910 --> 00:22:42,490
- We have so many weak links.
- Tell me about it.

606
00:22:42,490 --> 00:22:44,650
Still, So Min's not a bad dancer.

607
00:22:44,650 --> 00:22:46,350
- Yes, she is.
- Right.

608
00:22:46,350 --> 00:22:48,190
- She's a good dancer.
- That's right.

609
00:22:48,190 --> 00:22:50,090
I know this one so well.

610
00:22:50,700 --> 00:22:52,730
("Han" by Chakra)

611
00:22:52,730 --> 00:22:54,920
(Chakra's debut single
that was released in 2000)

612
00:22:54,920 --> 00:22:57,940
(The Indian inspired dancing
is the highlight of the song.)

613
00:22:58,300 --> 00:23:00,060
This won't be easy though.

614
00:23:02,330 --> 00:23:03,980
- That's it.
- No, wait...

615
00:23:04,210 --> 00:23:08,310
Don't make it look too cute.

616
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:11,140
- No.
- Don't be too cute!

617
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:12,640
Don't make it look cute.

618
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:14,450
- However, this dance...
- He won't know this.

619
00:23:14,450 --> 00:23:15,810
is hard to guess correctly.

620
00:23:15,810 --> 00:23:17,880
Also, the two younger ones
are at the front.

621
00:23:17,880 --> 00:23:19,880
Right, they'll never guess it right.

622
00:23:19,880 --> 00:23:20,960
Oh, no.

623
00:23:21,420 --> 00:23:24,150
(However, the dance seems like...)

624
00:23:24,150 --> 00:23:27,200
(Kungkungtta)

625
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:28,360
That looks good.

626
00:23:29,740 --> 00:23:30,740
(What's with the Kungkungtta?)

627
00:23:30,740 --> 00:23:32,740
<i>Foot of the mountain, kungkungtta</i>

628
00:23:32,740 --> 00:23:34,510
(It's a word relay.)

629
00:23:34,510 --> 00:23:36,400
<i>The foot of a big bear, kungkungtta</i>

630
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:38,280
<i>- Smelly feet, kungkungtta
- Kungkungtta</i>

631
00:23:38,280 --> 00:23:41,010
(All they did was sing the jingle.)

632
00:23:41,010 --> 00:23:43,020
(It fits perfectly.)

633
00:23:44,220 --> 00:23:45,610
Hurry up already.

634
00:23:46,020 --> 00:23:47,020
(In full power)

635
00:23:47,020 --> 00:23:48,580
Good, this is good.

636
00:23:48,910 --> 00:23:50,560
- What's going on?
- Nice.

637
00:23:50,560 --> 00:23:52,260
(Wow!)

638
00:23:52,260 --> 00:23:54,320
- What's going on?
- This is better.

639
00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:56,030
You're doing great.

640
00:23:56,030 --> 00:23:57,150
He's improvising.

641
00:23:57,500 --> 00:23:58,560
It looks similar.

642
00:23:58,820 --> 00:23:59,920
Nice.

643
00:23:59,920 --> 00:24:01,620
(Floundering)

644
00:24:01,620 --> 00:24:02,740
What...

645
00:24:02,740 --> 00:24:04,800
(What's this?)

646
00:24:04,800 --> 00:24:06,830
- What's this?
- The hands should be together.

647
00:24:06,830 --> 00:24:08,010
He forgot what's important.

648
00:24:08,010 --> 00:24:09,170
(Suk Jin only dances
with his expressions.)

649
00:24:09,170 --> 00:24:11,240
- What's going on?
- Suk Jin's being weird.

650
00:24:11,240 --> 00:24:12,810
Why isn't he putting
his hands together?

651
00:24:12,810 --> 00:24:14,370
- This is bad.
- Chakra.

652
00:24:14,370 --> 00:24:15,550
(Chakra!)

653
00:24:15,720 --> 00:24:18,020
(Se Chan guesses the artist
just by the dance moves.)

654
00:24:18,020 --> 00:24:19,140
(Surprised)

655
00:24:19,380 --> 00:24:21,520
(He just has to guess the song now.)

656
00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:22,560
"Han".

657
00:24:23,110 --> 00:24:25,020
(That is correct!)

658
00:24:25,730 --> 00:24:26,730
(No way!)

659
00:24:27,150 --> 00:24:29,420
(I can't believe it!)

660
00:24:29,420 --> 00:24:31,620
(So Min runs over to him in glee.)

661
00:24:32,390 --> 00:24:33,530
What?

662
00:24:33,820 --> 00:24:35,360
Did I guess it right?

663
00:24:35,630 --> 00:24:37,470
- What's going on?
- How did you know?

664
00:24:37,470 --> 00:24:38,500
Hold on.

665
00:24:38,810 --> 00:24:40,710
Seriously?
Chills just traveled down my spine.

666
00:24:40,710 --> 00:24:42,170
How did you guess it right?

667
00:24:42,170 --> 00:24:43,630
This...

668
00:24:43,630 --> 00:24:45,600
<i>- I have you locked
- I have you locked</i>

669
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:47,480
<i>- You're locked within me</i>
- Seriously?

670
00:24:47,710 --> 00:24:49,170
How did you know?

671
00:24:49,170 --> 00:24:50,610
Is it really "Han" by Chakra?

672
00:24:50,610 --> 00:24:52,610
- No way.
- Just think about it.

673
00:24:52,610 --> 00:24:53,810
Suk Jin didn't
bring his hands together.

674
00:24:53,810 --> 00:24:56,150
- He's red in the face.
- You should've done this.

675
00:24:56,150 --> 00:24:57,810
- This was key.
- How did Se Chan know?

676
00:24:58,310 --> 00:25:00,620
Anyway, this was a tricky question.

677
00:25:01,790 --> 00:25:03,650
Your girlfriend
came by earlier though.

678
00:25:03,650 --> 00:25:05,300
- What?
- When you got the question right.

679
00:25:05,300 --> 00:25:07,530
- Where?
- She was absolutely thrilled.

680
00:25:08,740 --> 00:25:11,440
(The girlfriend who was thrilled)

681
00:25:11,740 --> 00:25:13,040
- Right?
- Hold on.

682
00:25:13,040 --> 00:25:14,310
She was like this.

683
00:25:14,310 --> 00:25:16,280
- That's right.
- You mean So Min?

684
00:25:16,280 --> 00:25:17,440
- Didn't you know?
- His girlfriend.

685
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:18,780
- His girlfriend.
- That's right.

686
00:25:18,780 --> 00:25:20,710
- So Min.
- Se Chan's girlfriend.

687
00:25:20,710 --> 00:25:21,900
Anyway, she was here earlier.

688
00:25:21,900 --> 00:25:23,110
Wives are never that ecstatic.

689
00:25:23,110 --> 00:25:25,020
She came dashing over...

690
00:25:25,020 --> 00:25:26,610
and enjoyed the victory with you.

691
00:25:26,610 --> 00:25:28,380
She was like
his personal cheerleader.

692
00:25:28,380 --> 00:25:29,650
I was startled, So Min.

693
00:25:29,650 --> 00:25:30,650
Let's move on.

694
00:25:30,650 --> 00:25:32,920
Why don't we have
Suk Jin guess the song?

695
00:25:32,920 --> 00:25:34,420
- Let's change it up.
- He doesn't know many songs.

696
00:25:34,420 --> 00:25:35,890
He'll never guess them.

697
00:25:35,890 --> 00:25:38,200
- You should go first instead.
- Just follow the dance you see.

698
00:25:38,200 --> 00:25:40,390
It's best if he goes after So Min.

699
00:25:40,390 --> 00:25:41,470
We should have So Min
remedy the damage he does.

700
00:25:41,470 --> 00:25:42,800
Am I that big of a weak link?

701
00:25:42,800 --> 00:25:44,270
(He's upset.)

702
00:25:44,270 --> 00:25:45,440
(The weak link explodes.)

703
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:46,710
- I mean...
- He finally knows.

704
00:25:46,710 --> 00:25:48,330
- Finally!
- I only danced what I saw.

705
00:25:48,330 --> 00:25:50,330
- He finally knows.
- That's not it.

706
00:25:50,330 --> 00:25:52,550
- You don't.
- You never do.

707
00:25:52,550 --> 00:25:53,780
It wasn't what Kwang Soo danced.

708
00:25:53,780 --> 00:25:55,070
But Se Chan guessed
"Han" by Chakie.

709
00:25:55,070 --> 00:25:57,050
Did you just say Chakie?

710
00:25:57,450 --> 00:25:59,410
No, I meant Chakra.

711
00:25:59,410 --> 00:26:00,610
We have people who
can remedy the situation.

712
00:26:00,610 --> 00:26:03,220
I agree that it's best
for him to go first.

713
00:26:03,220 --> 00:26:06,650
Okay, I'll go first
like you all suggested.

714
00:26:06,730 --> 00:26:07,820
Don't hold me responsible though.

715
00:26:07,820 --> 00:26:09,420
What if he does a move
we can't mimic?

716
00:26:09,420 --> 00:26:10,650
- Then...
- His moves...

717
00:26:10,650 --> 00:26:13,030
So Min must try
and remedy the situation.

718
00:26:13,030 --> 00:26:15,030
So Min, do your best
to figure out what the dance is.

719
00:26:15,030 --> 00:26:16,940
Here we go.
Please put on your headsets.

720
00:26:16,940 --> 00:26:18,540
It has begun.

721
00:26:18,540 --> 00:26:20,770
(Which song does
Suk Jin have to dance to?)

722
00:26:20,770 --> 00:26:22,810
("Warrior's Descendant" by H.O.T)

723
00:26:22,810 --> 00:26:25,330
(Suk Jin must mimic
Jang Woo Hyuk's dancing.)

724
00:26:25,570 --> 00:26:27,370
Yes, that's the key move.

725
00:26:28,140 --> 00:26:31,110
- No, we're doomed.
- Why is he working out over there?

726
00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:33,020
Oh, no.

727
00:26:33,020 --> 00:26:35,380
- It's over.
- So Min could know.

728
00:26:35,410 --> 00:26:36,690
She might get the gist of it.

729
00:26:37,290 --> 00:26:39,320
(The stretching exercise version
of "Warrior's Descendant")

730
00:26:39,320 --> 00:26:41,530
- He's doing the key moves.
- That's it.

731
00:26:42,030 --> 00:26:44,530
- He did the key moves.
- That's not part of the dance.

732
00:26:44,530 --> 00:26:46,160
(Jumping)

733
00:26:46,160 --> 00:26:47,730
- That wasn't in the dance.
- Seriously?

734
00:26:47,730 --> 00:26:50,090
I told you this wasn't
going to work.

735
00:26:50,090 --> 00:26:52,100
I already said it'd be a disaster.

736
00:26:52,740 --> 00:26:54,440
This is bad.

737
00:26:54,810 --> 00:26:57,010
The jumping ruined it all.

738
00:26:57,010 --> 00:26:59,250
- Why did he have to jump?
- We need Se Chan.

739
00:26:59,280 --> 00:27:01,250
Look at Jinyoung dance.

740
00:27:01,250 --> 00:27:03,450
- Let's try and guess it right.
- How can one move like that?

741
00:27:04,280 --> 00:27:06,580
Here goes the next weak link.

742
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:07,810
It's a tricky one.

743
00:27:08,290 --> 00:27:10,790
This is looking weirder and weirder.

744
00:27:10,790 --> 00:27:13,190
(He suddenly goes
for the pelvic thrust.)

745
00:27:13,820 --> 00:27:15,620
(What?)

746
00:27:16,460 --> 00:27:19,390
Are you kidding me?
Why add what you didn't see?

747
00:27:19,420 --> 00:27:20,660
That's not what he danced.

748
00:27:21,060 --> 00:27:22,270
Hey!

749
00:27:22,270 --> 00:27:23,630
- That's it.
- Hold on.

750
00:27:23,630 --> 00:27:25,600
He's just dancing however he likes.

751
00:27:25,830 --> 00:27:27,630
(And now Eun Soo's
doing the wrong moves.)

752
00:27:27,630 --> 00:27:28,660
This?

753
00:27:29,900 --> 00:27:31,900
This? It's Jang Do Yeon's move.

754
00:27:31,900 --> 00:27:35,280
- That wasn't what he danced.
- Why on earth did you add that?

755
00:27:35,280 --> 00:27:37,910
- Isn't it Jang Do Yeon?
- What on earth is this move?

756
00:27:37,910 --> 00:27:40,840
Why on earth did you add that move?

757
00:27:41,520 --> 00:27:42,880
What is this?

758
00:27:42,990 --> 00:27:44,110
Well...

759
00:27:44,290 --> 00:27:45,380
What's the answer?

760
00:27:46,320 --> 00:27:48,530
Hold on. Is it...

761
00:27:48,620 --> 00:27:49,760
H.O.T?

762
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:53,820
(He guessed H.O.T
after looking at that dance?)

763
00:27:54,560 --> 00:27:57,740
(Will Se Chan make
another miracle happen?)

764
00:27:58,590 --> 00:28:01,900
(Which song by H.O.T?)

765
00:28:01,900 --> 00:28:02,980
"We Are the Future".

766
00:28:03,870 --> 00:28:05,950
- "Warrior's Descendant".
- It was "Warrior's Descendant".

767
00:28:06,510 --> 00:28:08,750
- That was close!
- "Warrior's Descendant"?

768
00:28:08,810 --> 00:28:10,250
- What...
- I'll tell you what happened.

769
00:28:10,250 --> 00:28:12,250
Kwang Soo ruined it all.

770
00:28:12,250 --> 00:28:14,550
Why did you throw
Jang Do Yeon into the mix?

771
00:28:14,550 --> 00:28:16,380
Why did you add that?

772
00:28:16,380 --> 00:28:18,220
- That was so close.
- It just came out.

773
00:28:18,220 --> 00:28:20,230
- This won't work.
- It was added in the middle.

774
00:28:20,230 --> 00:28:22,390
- So Min must go first.
- What about Jinyoung?

775
00:28:22,390 --> 00:28:24,920
- Right, you can copy it.
- Copy the moves.

776
00:28:24,920 --> 00:28:26,800
(Jinyoung will start off
the sixth song.)

777
00:28:26,800 --> 00:28:28,530
This one's too easy.

778
00:28:28,530 --> 00:28:30,390
- It's a done deal.
- It's too easy.

779
00:28:30,390 --> 00:28:31,500
This is a famous one.

780
00:28:32,060 --> 00:28:34,810
("Touch My Body" by SISTAR)

781
00:28:34,810 --> 00:28:36,630
(Its stand-out move...)

782
00:28:36,630 --> 00:28:39,900
(is the hip jerking
that's done turned around.)

783
00:28:41,370 --> 00:28:42,410
Jinyoung will easily do this.

784
00:28:42,520 --> 00:28:43,610
(He dances exactly
what he saw on the video.)

785
00:28:43,610 --> 00:28:45,250
That's it.

786
00:28:45,720 --> 00:28:48,290
(Perfectly copied)

787
00:28:48,750 --> 00:28:50,080
That's it.

788
00:28:50,080 --> 00:28:52,020
Jinyoung...

789
00:28:52,150 --> 00:28:53,730
copied the move instantly.

790
00:28:55,350 --> 00:28:56,650
So Min just wants
to keep seeing him dance.

791
00:28:56,650 --> 00:28:58,300
So Min, that's enough!

792
00:28:58,420 --> 00:29:00,200
(She has an ulterior motive.)

793
00:29:01,270 --> 00:29:03,740
(After double-checking the move,
she relays it to Suk Jin.)

794
00:29:04,700 --> 00:29:06,810
(She dances the move
Jinyoung showed her.)

795
00:29:06,810 --> 00:29:08,770
Nice. She's a great dancer.

796
00:29:09,210 --> 00:29:10,900
(What? Hold on.)

797
00:29:11,670 --> 00:29:13,250
(Like a traditional dance)

798
00:29:13,250 --> 00:29:16,050
Why is he making moves up
when he saw her dance just now?

799
00:29:17,310 --> 00:29:19,490
You've got to be kidding me.

800
00:29:20,520 --> 00:29:23,350
- Oh, no. This is bad.
- What is that?

801
00:29:23,350 --> 00:29:24,560
We're doomed.

802
00:29:24,910 --> 00:29:26,990
- It's over for us.
- Is he kicking a hacky sack?

803
00:29:26,990 --> 00:29:29,000
- No way.
- He's driving me crazy.

804
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:31,120
- Let's do this.
- Can I kick him?

805
00:29:31,120 --> 00:29:32,530
I want to fly over there
and kick him.

806
00:29:32,820 --> 00:29:34,090
Okay, that's enough.

807
00:29:34,530 --> 00:29:36,330
Are you kidding me?

808
00:29:36,470 --> 00:29:38,440
(Sungguridangdang sungdangdang)

809
00:29:40,470 --> 00:29:41,810
Just dance what you saw!

810
00:29:41,810 --> 00:29:44,010
- What on earth is that?
- Gosh.

811
00:29:44,130 --> 00:29:45,900
Just dance the moves you saw!

812
00:29:45,900 --> 00:29:48,710
What are we going to do
with those two?

813
00:29:48,710 --> 00:29:50,220
I so want to kick them.

814
00:29:50,220 --> 00:29:51,370
Just dance what you saw.

815
00:29:51,370 --> 00:29:52,640
Those two...

816
00:29:53,380 --> 00:29:54,610
What on earth is this?

817
00:29:55,080 --> 00:29:56,910
(What on earth is this?)

818
00:29:56,910 --> 00:29:59,150
Now Eun Soo's being weird as well.

819
00:29:59,530 --> 00:30:01,120
He'll never get this right.

820
00:30:01,120 --> 00:30:02,300
It's impossible.

821
00:30:02,300 --> 00:30:04,650
Just consider it as a useless hint.

822
00:30:04,650 --> 00:30:05,770
I have no idea.

823
00:30:05,770 --> 00:30:06,770
(I'm going to have to guess.)

824
00:30:06,820 --> 00:30:07,820
SISTAR?

825
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:11,270
(He got the artist right again!)

826
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:12,560
What's the song?

827
00:30:12,560 --> 00:30:15,600
(Will Se Chan be able to guess
the song?)

828
00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:16,630
"SHAKE IT"?

829
00:30:16,900 --> 00:30:17,980
- Gosh.
- "SHAKE IT"...

830
00:30:19,050 --> 00:30:21,010
- That was so close.
- Unbelievable.

831
00:30:21,010 --> 00:30:22,210
Why didn't anyone do this move?

832
00:30:22,210 --> 00:30:23,980
- Yes, this.
- They started off with that.

833
00:30:23,980 --> 00:30:25,640
All I needed was this.

834
00:30:25,640 --> 00:30:27,720
- It was his fault, wasn't it?
- Just look.

835
00:30:27,720 --> 00:30:29,380
See how it came down.

836
00:30:29,380 --> 00:30:30,720
Jinyoung, show them.

837
00:30:31,380 --> 00:30:33,260
Go ahead. That's it.

838
00:30:33,260 --> 00:30:35,080
- See?
- So Min, what about you?

839
00:30:35,080 --> 00:30:36,730
(So Min danced it perfectly too.)

840
00:30:36,730 --> 00:30:38,060
Now Suk Jin.

841
00:30:40,820 --> 00:30:42,060
Oh, dear.

842
00:30:42,500 --> 00:30:44,390
(His dancing makes everyone lament.)

843
00:30:44,390 --> 00:30:47,600
And now show them
how you danced it.

844
00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:49,600
How on earth does that become this?

845
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:51,870
- Are you kidding me?
- Gosh.

846
00:30:51,870 --> 00:30:53,710
Let's take out all the weak links.

847
00:30:53,710 --> 00:30:55,280
- Move.
- We know who is good at this.

848
00:30:55,280 --> 00:30:56,720
Now, Haha, get in line.

849
00:30:56,720 --> 00:30:58,520
- Avengers assemble.
- Haha and Jong Kook.

850
00:30:58,520 --> 00:31:00,220
- Okay.
- Eun Soo, stay there.

851
00:31:00,220 --> 00:31:01,880
Avengers assemble.

852
00:31:01,880 --> 00:31:04,110
The Avengers
will play the game this time.

853
00:31:04,110 --> 00:31:06,420
- We need to get this right.
- Please.

854
00:31:06,420 --> 00:31:08,650
If we can't answer this correctly...

855
00:31:08,650 --> 00:31:10,030
- He's right.
- Let's just give up.

856
00:31:10,030 --> 00:31:11,350
- Okay.
- We need to get this right.

857
00:31:11,350 --> 00:31:12,800
This is our last chance.

858
00:31:12,800 --> 00:31:14,530
Now that I see you all,

859
00:31:14,530 --> 00:31:16,740
it makes sense
that Eun Soo is one of us.

860
00:31:16,740 --> 00:31:17,800
(He punches them with hard facts.)

861
00:31:17,940 --> 00:31:18,940
(Two weak links)

862
00:31:18,940 --> 00:31:20,210
You're right.

863
00:31:20,210 --> 00:31:22,400
It's either Eun Soo or Ri.

864
00:31:22,400 --> 00:31:23,780
What about me?

865
00:31:25,540 --> 00:31:27,140
(There's me!)

866
00:31:27,140 --> 00:31:28,140
Ji Hyo...

867
00:31:28,600 --> 00:31:29,640
Well...

868
00:31:30,410 --> 00:31:33,840
After this round,
can we let them do a bonus round?

869
00:31:34,490 --> 00:31:36,910
- I'd like to watch them.
- We're out of questions.

870
00:31:36,910 --> 00:31:38,410
Okay, I get it.

871
00:31:38,410 --> 00:31:39,880
Only Eun Soo has to do a good job.

872
00:31:40,820 --> 00:31:42,080
This is another easy one.

873
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:44,120
- He's taking a while.
- Jinyoung will know this.

874
00:31:44,120 --> 00:31:45,390
- It's an oldie though.
- He'll know this.

875
00:31:45,390 --> 00:31:47,620
- He can copy the moves.
- That's right.

876
00:31:47,730 --> 00:31:49,500
Look at that.

877
00:31:50,130 --> 00:31:53,400
("Into the New World"
by Girls' Generation)

878
00:31:53,400 --> 00:31:55,210
(There are a lot of moves
that stand out.)

879
00:31:55,210 --> 00:31:58,630
(One of them is the kick!)

880
00:31:59,870 --> 00:32:01,810
(He's copying the moves.)

881
00:32:02,610 --> 00:32:03,910
- Talk about being competent.
- I don't know what it is.

882
00:32:03,910 --> 00:32:05,640
He's too good at this.

883
00:32:05,640 --> 00:32:06,790
(A meeting between a competent man
and a pop dancer.)

884
00:32:07,640 --> 00:32:09,960
(Jinyoung dances,)

885
00:32:09,960 --> 00:32:12,560
(and So Min copies him.)

886
00:32:12,560 --> 00:32:14,190
(Is this right?)

887
00:32:14,190 --> 00:32:15,260
Is that it?

888
00:32:15,260 --> 00:32:17,730
(They communicate through dance.)

889
00:32:18,530 --> 00:32:19,970
(What are they doing?)

890
00:32:20,420 --> 00:32:22,390
(Her boyfriend has no idea.)

891
00:32:23,090 --> 00:32:24,500
(Let me dance this time.)

892
00:32:24,500 --> 00:32:27,130
Is this "Dirty Dancing" or what?

893
00:32:27,130 --> 00:32:28,600
(Is this the movie,
"Dirty Dancing"?)

894
00:32:29,280 --> 00:32:30,370
"Dirty Dancing"?

895
00:32:31,630 --> 00:32:35,510
(The characters in the movie
communicated through dance.)

896
00:32:35,840 --> 00:32:37,310
(They take turns dancing.)

897
00:32:37,310 --> 00:32:38,840
- What is this?
- This is not good.

898
00:32:39,080 --> 00:32:40,190
It's too hard.

899
00:32:40,190 --> 00:32:41,810
(So Min comes out of the romantic
movie and carries out the mission.)

900
00:32:42,340 --> 00:32:44,720
This is way too hard.

901
00:32:45,790 --> 00:32:47,080
(Oh!)

902
00:32:48,420 --> 00:32:51,120
(So Min realizes the answer
and kicks.)

903
00:32:51,800 --> 00:32:55,500
(It's the key move from "Into the
New World" that Jinyoung missed.)

904
00:32:55,890 --> 00:32:57,540
(So Min copies the dance perfectly.)

905
00:32:58,240 --> 00:33:00,270
(She sure is a pop-dance expert.)

906
00:33:00,270 --> 00:33:02,240
Well done.

907
00:33:02,330 --> 00:33:03,370
So Min knows the answer.

908
00:33:03,370 --> 00:33:04,510
(It's So Min's Generation.)

909
00:33:05,330 --> 00:33:07,050
(Thanks to So Min,
Haha knows the answer.)

910
00:33:07,050 --> 00:33:09,780
(He emphasizes the kick.)

911
00:33:09,910 --> 00:33:11,610
That's the key.

912
00:33:11,720 --> 00:33:13,810
- We'll make it this time.
- But...

913
00:33:14,140 --> 00:33:15,750
- Eun Soo doesn't seem to know.
- She does.

914
00:33:15,750 --> 00:33:16,760
(Suk Jin is worried about Eun Soo.)

915
00:33:16,880 --> 00:33:17,910
Go, Eun Soo.

916
00:33:17,910 --> 00:33:19,690
(She kicks twice.)

917
00:33:19,880 --> 00:33:22,060
- She shouldn't kick twice.
- It's only once.

918
00:33:22,060 --> 00:33:23,420
She's suspicious.

919
00:33:23,560 --> 00:33:24,650
Why...

920
00:33:24,890 --> 00:33:26,000
(Kicking)

921
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:27,560
She must be the Clacking Ghost.

922
00:33:27,560 --> 00:33:28,660
(Suk Jin suspects Eun Soo.)

923
00:33:28,730 --> 00:33:29,740
She's the Clacking Ghost.

924
00:33:29,860 --> 00:33:31,740
(It's Jong Kook's turn.)

925
00:33:32,540 --> 00:33:34,040
(He suddenly dances the can-can.)

926
00:33:34,040 --> 00:33:35,100
That's not right.

927
00:33:35,660 --> 00:33:37,010
- This is not good.
- What is that?

928
00:33:37,570 --> 00:33:39,340
(Perfect)

929
00:33:39,480 --> 00:33:40,870
(Double kick)

930
00:33:41,900 --> 00:33:43,840
(The dance has become
completely different.)

931
00:33:44,810 --> 00:33:46,490
(Jong Kook's dance looks
too different.)

932
00:33:46,490 --> 00:33:48,140
- What's that?
- What's that?

933
00:33:48,140 --> 00:33:49,560
- That's Park Jin Young's song.
- Park Jin Young.

934
00:33:49,560 --> 00:33:51,650
- "Swing Baby".
- That's wrong.

935
00:33:51,650 --> 00:33:54,530
- It wasn't this? The woman...
- No.

936
00:33:54,530 --> 00:33:56,060
It was "Into the New World"
by Girls' Generation.

937
00:33:56,150 --> 00:33:58,060
- That's why they kicked.
- It was wrong.

938
00:33:58,200 --> 00:33:59,530
You have to kick like this.

939
00:33:59,530 --> 00:34:01,500
- I thought...
- We started off fine.

940
00:34:01,560 --> 00:34:03,330
I thought it was,
"I'm not a little girl anymore..."

941
00:34:03,330 --> 00:34:05,200
- Park Ji Yoon.
- Right.

942
00:34:05,330 --> 00:34:07,360
It was too hard.

943
00:34:07,360 --> 00:34:09,400
There's one question left,
but it's meaningless.

944
00:34:09,400 --> 00:34:11,870
- You've failed every question.
- All right.

945
00:34:12,040 --> 00:34:15,280
You can't receive hints about
Coughing Ghost and Clacking Ghost.

946
00:34:15,810 --> 00:34:16,910
Then we can't find them.

947
00:34:16,910 --> 00:34:19,690
You've failed this mission.

948
00:34:19,810 --> 00:34:23,720
- Let's move on to the next.
- I think I know.

949
00:34:24,850 --> 00:34:27,350
I'll give you a chance
to win a hint...

950
00:34:27,350 --> 00:34:29,850
- You should.
- about the ghosts.

951
00:34:29,850 --> 00:34:31,620
- Okay.
- We're going to play...

952
00:34:31,890 --> 00:34:33,090
Yes or No, Answer Me.

953
00:34:33,090 --> 00:34:34,360
This is fun.

954
00:34:34,360 --> 00:34:35,560
- It's...
- Gosh.

955
00:34:35,560 --> 00:34:37,940
- It's harder than you think.
- It's confusing.

956
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:41,210
If I say, "Yes or no, answer me,"
and then "I like Korean food,"

957
00:34:41,210 --> 00:34:43,670
- you say a Korean dish.
- Kimchi jjigae.

958
00:34:43,670 --> 00:34:45,670
If I say, "I dislike Korean food,"

959
00:34:45,670 --> 00:34:47,480
you have to say the name of a food
that's not Korean.

960
00:34:47,480 --> 00:34:48,900
Spaghetti or pasta, for example.

961
00:34:48,900 --> 00:34:49,910
Pizza.

962
00:34:49,910 --> 00:34:52,050
<i>- Pasta I dislike
- Pasta</i>

963
00:34:52,050 --> 00:34:54,050
If you make a mistake,
you'll be suspected.

964
00:34:54,050 --> 00:34:57,490
We'll play three times.
If you succeed once, you win a hint.

965
00:34:58,190 --> 00:35:00,150
For warm-up,
let's start with So Min...

966
00:35:00,150 --> 00:35:01,820
- and continue this way.
- Okay.

967
00:35:01,820 --> 00:35:02,920
Let's start with So Min.

968
00:35:03,020 --> 00:35:06,000
<i>- Yes or no, answer me
- Yes or no, answer me</i>

969
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:07,320
<i>I dislike actresses</i>

970
00:35:08,090 --> 00:35:09,860
<i>Lee Kwang Soo I dislike</i>

971
00:35:10,590 --> 00:35:12,360
(She did it right,
but I feel offended.)

972
00:35:12,360 --> 00:35:13,730
<i>I like comedians</i>

973
00:35:13,730 --> 00:35:15,310
<i>Yoo Jae Suk I like</i>

974
00:35:15,310 --> 00:35:16,730
<i>I like male idol singers</i>

975
00:35:16,730 --> 00:35:18,310
<i>Jinyoung I like</i>

976
00:35:18,310 --> 00:35:19,940
<i>I dislike trot singers</i>

977
00:35:19,940 --> 00:35:22,980
<i>- Na Hoon A I like </i>
- It's "dislike."

978
00:35:22,980 --> 00:35:24,440
(He was supposed to say,
"I dislike.")

979
00:35:24,440 --> 00:35:26,020
- "I dislike."
- What?

980
00:35:26,020 --> 00:35:27,690
He said, "I dislike."
You have to say it too.

981
00:35:27,790 --> 00:35:29,250
- But I like them.
- No.

982
00:35:29,250 --> 00:35:30,380
He likes them.

983
00:35:30,460 --> 00:35:32,630
(I like trot singers.)

984
00:35:32,630 --> 00:35:33,980
It's not about
your personal opinion.

985
00:35:33,980 --> 00:35:35,380
- If he says, "I dislike,"
- Some people are stubborn like him.

986
00:35:35,380 --> 00:35:36,630
you have to say it too.

987
00:35:36,730 --> 00:35:39,690
And you have to name
a person who isn't a trot singer.

988
00:35:39,690 --> 00:35:41,360
Give my name, "Yang Se Chan,"
for example.

989
00:35:42,270 --> 00:35:43,570
- Let's start with Ri.
- Okay.

990
00:35:43,570 --> 00:35:45,040
- Let's do this!
- And the last player...

991
00:35:45,040 --> 00:35:46,730
- will be Kyung Hwan.
- Okay.

992
00:35:46,840 --> 00:35:49,770
<i>- Yes or no, answer me
- Yes or no, answer me</i>

993
00:35:49,770 --> 00:35:51,310
<i>I like African countries</i>

994
00:35:51,570 --> 00:35:53,150
<i>I like Africa</i>

995
00:35:53,270 --> 00:35:54,810
- Gosh.
- What?

996
00:35:55,770 --> 00:35:58,480
(Everyone is complaining.)

997
00:35:58,480 --> 00:36:00,690
- I like Zambia, Morocco...
- Senegal.

998
00:36:00,690 --> 00:36:02,610
- Ghana.
- Senegal, Ghana...

999
00:36:02,610 --> 00:36:03,790
That was strange.

1000
00:36:03,790 --> 00:36:04,980
Why couldn't you do that?

1001
00:36:05,480 --> 00:36:08,020
- Ri, I'm disappointed.
- But...

1002
00:36:08,020 --> 00:36:10,320
This is driving me crazy.

1003
00:36:10,460 --> 00:36:12,520
Then let's start back here.

1004
00:36:12,520 --> 00:36:13,820
Let's start with Jinyoung.

1005
00:36:13,820 --> 00:36:15,130
- Okay.
- Me? Okay.

1006
00:36:15,130 --> 00:36:16,790
- Who's behind me?
- Okay.

1007
00:36:16,790 --> 00:36:18,460
If you fail this time too,
you'll be suspected.

1008
00:36:18,630 --> 00:36:21,960
<i>- Yes or no, answer me
- Yes or no, answer me</i>

1009
00:36:21,960 --> 00:36:23,340
<i>I like tropical fruits</i>

1010
00:36:23,340 --> 00:36:25,230
<i>Mangoes I like</i>

1011
00:36:25,940 --> 00:36:27,810
<i>Mangoes I like</i>

1012
00:36:28,480 --> 00:36:29,880
<i>I dislike Korean movies</i>

1013
00:36:30,170 --> 00:36:32,570
<i>"Titanic" I dislike</i>

1014
00:36:32,710 --> 00:36:33,880
<i>I dislike foreign movies</i>

1015
00:36:34,420 --> 00:36:35,540
<i>I dislike</i>

1016
00:36:35,650 --> 00:36:37,090
(- I dislike foreign movies
- Confused.)

1017
00:36:37,190 --> 00:36:38,290
- Time's up.
- What?

1018
00:36:38,290 --> 00:36:39,630
"Tazza: One-Eyed Jacks"!

1019
00:36:39,630 --> 00:36:42,650
(If you dislike foreign movies,
say, "Tazza: One-Eyed Jacks.")

1020
00:36:44,020 --> 00:36:46,590
That was an easy question for us.

1021
00:36:46,590 --> 00:36:47,670
(Kwang Soo feels bitter.)

1022
00:36:47,670 --> 00:36:49,400
- "Tazza: One-Eyed Jacks."
- You're suspicious.

1023
00:36:49,400 --> 00:36:51,070
Why would you say
you dislike that movie?

1024
00:36:51,070 --> 00:36:53,710
Running Man knows
only one Korean movie.

1025
00:36:53,710 --> 00:36:55,070
(They're all fanatics of the movie.)

1026
00:36:55,210 --> 00:36:57,670
(Only one Korean movie is allowed
for Running Man.)

1027
00:36:57,670 --> 00:37:00,400
Why? Why is that
the only Korean movie?

1028
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:02,270
- Why did you fail?
- It's been too long.

1029
00:37:02,270 --> 00:37:04,170
- Let's start with So Min this time.
- Me?

1030
00:37:04,270 --> 00:37:05,480
Let's start with So Min.

1031
00:37:05,610 --> 00:37:09,290
<i>- Yes or no, answer me
- Yes or no, answer me</i>

1032
00:37:09,290 --> 00:37:10,860
<i>I like red fruits</i>

1033
00:37:11,060 --> 00:37:12,880
<i>- Apples I like</i>
- There you go.

1034
00:37:12,880 --> 00:37:14,420
<i>I like trot singers</i>

1035
00:37:14,420 --> 00:37:16,090
<i>Jin Sung I like</i>

1036
00:37:16,560 --> 00:37:18,020
<i>I dislike romance movies</i>

1037
00:37:18,020 --> 00:37:19,730
<i>"Tazza" I dislike</i>

1038
00:37:20,690 --> 00:37:22,400
(I get it, so please stop.)

1039
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:23,770
I dislike cartoons

1040
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:25,090
I dislike...

1041
00:37:26,270 --> 00:37:27,340
"One-Eyed Jacks"

1042
00:37:27,340 --> 00:37:28,360
I dislike...

1043
00:37:29,570 --> 00:37:30,710
"One-Eyed Jacks"

1044
00:37:31,500 --> 00:37:32,810
Gosh.

1045
00:37:32,810 --> 00:37:34,540
"Tazza" saved two people.

1046
00:37:34,940 --> 00:37:36,000
Good.

1047
00:37:36,270 --> 00:37:37,750
<i>I like Korean historical figures</i>

1048
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:39,480
<i>I like Yi Sun Sin</i>

1049
00:37:39,480 --> 00:37:40,820
<i>I dislike red food</i>

1050
00:37:41,040 --> 00:37:42,750
<i>I dislike Korean melons</i>

1051
00:37:43,090 --> 00:37:44,520
<i>I dislike Korean pop songs</i>

1052
00:37:44,790 --> 00:37:45,960
<i>I dislike...</i>

1053
00:37:46,420 --> 00:37:48,020
What? Why?

1054
00:37:48,150 --> 00:37:49,860
- Hey!
- "Speechless"!

1055
00:37:49,860 --> 00:37:53,020
(Jong Kook is a living witness
of the Korean pop scene.)

1056
00:37:53,690 --> 00:37:55,360
- Hey!
- "Speechless"!

1057
00:37:55,590 --> 00:37:57,790
You don't know any foreign songs?

1058
00:37:57,790 --> 00:37:59,170
- It doesn't make sense.
- No.

1059
00:37:59,170 --> 00:38:00,610
- He's suspicious.
- I swear.

1060
00:38:00,610 --> 00:38:02,000
- I swear.
- He's suspicious.

1061
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:04,400
- I didn't remember "Speechless".
- Why didn't you say "Speechless"?

1062
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:05,570
I didn't remember the title.

1063
00:38:05,670 --> 00:38:07,040
I swear.

1064
00:38:07,040 --> 00:38:08,270
Why...

1065
00:38:08,270 --> 00:38:10,040
Why did you ask me about pop songs?

1066
00:38:10,040 --> 00:38:11,320
You sang...

1067
00:38:11,320 --> 00:38:12,480
Let me start.

1068
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:14,480
- Everyone is suspicious.
- Let's play again, starting here.

1069
00:38:14,480 --> 00:38:15,940
Forget it. It's over.

1070
00:38:15,940 --> 00:38:17,880
You failed to win a hint...

1071
00:38:17,880 --> 00:38:20,190
- about the ghosts again.
- Gosh.

1072
00:38:20,360 --> 00:38:21,630
The ghosts would be relieved.

1073
00:38:21,630 --> 00:38:23,500
This time,
Jong Kook was suspicious.

1074
00:38:23,500 --> 00:38:25,230
(They arrive at
the last mission spot.)

1075
00:38:25,230 --> 00:38:28,230
This is the last mission
where you can find the ghosts.

1076
00:38:28,230 --> 00:38:30,790
- It's called Late Night TV Station.
- What's that?

1077
00:38:30,790 --> 00:38:32,730
- We're back here.
- It still looks the same.

1078
00:38:33,570 --> 00:38:35,570
Hidden in the TV station
are hints about...

1079
00:38:35,570 --> 00:38:37,270
Coughing Ghost, Clacking Ghost,

1080
00:38:37,270 --> 00:38:39,380
the producer,
and the assistant director.

1081
00:38:39,650 --> 00:38:42,650
To win, the "Dalim Man" staff
has to either eliminate...

1082
00:38:42,650 --> 00:38:44,270
Coughing Ghost and Clacking Ghost...

1083
00:38:44,270 --> 00:38:46,940
or find the legendary proposal
and put it in the safe in the lobby.

1084
00:38:46,940 --> 00:38:48,340
(They have to either find the ghosts
or put the proposal in the safe.)

1085
00:38:48,340 --> 00:38:51,750
Coughing Ghost and Clacking Ghost
has to either eliminate...

1086
00:38:51,750 --> 00:38:54,880
the producer or find and sign
the legendary proposal.

1087
00:38:54,980 --> 00:38:56,520
They just need to sign it?

1088
00:38:56,520 --> 00:38:57,920
- Yes.
- That's the ghosts' mission.

1089
00:38:58,020 --> 00:39:00,900
The losing team will be penalized.

1090
00:39:00,900 --> 00:39:04,860
Only the "Dalim Man" staff
can put a proposal in the safe.

1091
00:39:04,860 --> 00:39:07,840
If they put in the wrong proposal,
they lose immediately.

1092
00:39:08,230 --> 00:39:10,770
Coughing Ghost and Clacking Ghost
will also lose immediately...

1093
00:39:10,770 --> 00:39:12,570
if they sign the wrong proposal.

1094
00:39:12,570 --> 00:39:14,940
- There are wrong proposals?
- There must be many proposals.

1095
00:39:15,170 --> 00:39:16,520
There are wrong proposals,

1096
00:39:16,520 --> 00:39:18,110
- so Kwang Soo, be careful.
- Yes.

1097
00:39:18,110 --> 00:39:20,090
- What?
- Keep your eyes wide open.

1098
00:39:20,090 --> 00:39:22,540
Also, on the 11th floor...

1099
00:39:23,320 --> 00:39:26,560
- is the Ghost Radio Booth.
- What's that?

1100
00:39:26,920 --> 00:39:29,320
Three people who won
audience tickets can bring...

1101
00:39:29,320 --> 00:39:31,460
one partner each
into the radio booth.

1102
00:39:31,460 --> 00:39:34,670
If the producer, assistant director,
Coughing Ghost, or Clacking Ghost...

1103
00:39:34,670 --> 00:39:37,400
is in the booth,
you'll hear a special sound.

1104
00:39:37,630 --> 00:39:39,290
- What are you?
- What?

1105
00:39:39,290 --> 00:39:40,440
Tell me the truth.

1106
00:39:40,570 --> 00:39:42,400
- I wasn't told anything.
- You have a role, don't you?

1107
00:39:43,310 --> 00:39:44,840
Behind the assistant director's
name tag is...

1108
00:39:44,840 --> 00:39:46,570
a crucial hint.

1109
00:39:47,440 --> 00:39:49,340
If the producer, assistant director,
Coughing Ghost, or Clacking Ghost...

1110
00:39:49,340 --> 00:39:51,570
eliminates two people by ripping off
their name tags,

1111
00:39:51,570 --> 00:39:53,710
they will get a protective
shield on their name tag.

1112
00:39:53,710 --> 00:39:58,060
(By eliminating 2 people,
they get a protective shield.)

1113
00:39:58,060 --> 00:40:00,480
In that case,
they will not be eliminated...

1114
00:40:00,480 --> 00:40:02,560
even if their name tag is
ripped off.

1115
00:40:02,790 --> 00:40:04,420
- By eliminating two people?
- Yes.

1116
00:40:04,420 --> 00:40:05,560
- That's unfair.
- And they become invincible.

1117
00:40:05,590 --> 00:40:06,900
Then how do you win?

1118
00:40:06,900 --> 00:40:08,460
You find the proposal.

1119
00:40:08,460 --> 00:40:11,040
- And put it in the safe?
- You either sign it...

1120
00:40:11,040 --> 00:40:12,840
or put it in the safe.

1121
00:40:12,940 --> 00:40:14,730
Can you rip off any name tag?

1122
00:40:14,730 --> 00:40:16,630
If you happen to rip off
the producer's name tag,

1123
00:40:16,630 --> 00:40:18,110
you'll all lose.

1124
00:40:18,110 --> 00:40:20,480
The producer will have to
win people over to his or her side.

1125
00:40:20,570 --> 00:40:24,170
How about we share the hints
we received?

1126
00:40:24,320 --> 00:40:26,170
I'm innocent. Tell me.

1127
00:40:26,170 --> 00:40:27,750
Isn't it better to share the hints?

1128
00:40:28,040 --> 00:40:30,880
The hint said there's no ghost
on Team New Producer.

1129
00:40:30,880 --> 00:40:32,380
- No ghost?
- No ghost?

1130
00:40:34,020 --> 00:40:41,320
(The number of ghosts
on Team New Producer is...)

1131
00:40:41,320 --> 00:40:42,790
(zero.)

1132
00:40:42,790 --> 00:40:46,070
The hint said there's no ghost
on Team New Producer.

1133
00:40:46,070 --> 00:40:47,610
- No ghost?
- No ghost?

1134
00:40:47,610 --> 00:40:49,070
Team New Producer, gather around.

1135
00:40:49,460 --> 00:40:51,070
I'm here.

1136
00:40:51,230 --> 00:40:53,270
- The four of us aren't the ghosts.
- We aren't the ghosts.

1137
00:40:53,400 --> 00:40:54,610
That's the hint we got.

1138
00:40:54,610 --> 00:40:55,880
(Jae Suk, Suk Jin, Se Chan‚
and Eun Soo aren't the ghosts.)

1139
00:40:55,880 --> 00:40:58,540
So we're the ones left,
including Ji Hyo.

1140
00:40:59,250 --> 00:41:00,540
So they're among these eight?

1141
00:41:00,690 --> 00:41:03,460
Assistant Director, Producer,
Clacking Ghost...

1142
00:41:03,520 --> 00:41:07,380
- Please go to your positions.
- This is hard.

1143
00:41:07,520 --> 00:41:08,590
I'm clueless.

1144
00:41:08,590 --> 00:41:09,960
- So Min!
- Yes?

1145
00:41:10,130 --> 00:41:11,820
You better be careful.

1146
00:41:11,820 --> 00:41:14,920
I have to be.
I'd be target number one.

1147
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:17,190
- Aren't you the producer?
- I'm not.

1148
00:41:17,190 --> 00:41:18,630
- Are you the assistant director?
- No.

1149
00:41:18,630 --> 00:41:21,070
You can't be the Clacking Ghost.

1150
00:41:21,070 --> 00:41:22,170
You're the Crazy Ghost.

1151
00:41:22,170 --> 00:41:24,630
(You can't be the Clacking Ghost.
You're the Crazy Ghost.)

1152
00:41:24,630 --> 00:41:25,810
That's you.

1153
00:41:25,880 --> 00:41:26,980
You're the Crazy Ghost.

1154
00:41:27,750 --> 00:41:29,650
- See you later.
- On which floor?

1155
00:41:29,650 --> 00:41:30,940
(They go to their positions
for now.)

1156
00:41:30,940 --> 00:41:32,480
- We'll see.
- Come to the 10th floor.

1157
00:41:32,770 --> 00:41:33,880
I'm going to the 18th floor.

1158
00:41:33,880 --> 00:41:35,250
- Come to the 10th floor.
- Okay.

1159
00:41:37,110 --> 00:41:38,750
Wait, why are there two cameras
shooting me?

1160
00:41:39,730 --> 00:41:41,750
Am I getting a sudden mission
or something?

1161
00:41:42,130 --> 00:41:44,360
Let me see. There are two cameras.

1162
00:41:44,360 --> 00:41:46,190
I'm not supposed to be here.
I was supposed to shoot Eun Soo,

1163
00:41:46,460 --> 00:41:47,520
but I lost her.

1164
00:41:47,520 --> 00:41:49,900
Can't you just shoot me?
Why do you have to be so honest?

1165
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:51,940
Okay, I get it.

1166
00:41:53,730 --> 00:41:54,940
Aren't you getting out?

1167
00:41:55,670 --> 00:41:57,070
Seriously?

1168
00:41:57,540 --> 00:41:59,810
For Clacking Ghost
and Coughing Ghost...

1169
00:42:00,150 --> 00:42:01,250
I suspect Kwang Soo.

1170
00:42:02,250 --> 00:42:03,250
(Kwang Soo is suspected again.)

1171
00:42:03,250 --> 00:42:05,710
Kwang Soo is always suspicious.

1172
00:42:05,880 --> 00:42:08,540
I personally think Ri has...

1173
00:42:08,540 --> 00:42:09,980
some kind of a role.

1174
00:42:10,360 --> 00:42:12,590
Coughing Ghost would cough...

1175
00:42:12,590 --> 00:42:13,650
(Haha makes name-based deductions.)

1176
00:42:13,650 --> 00:42:15,420
and Clacking Ghost would wear
high heels.

1177
00:42:15,420 --> 00:42:16,860
During the opening,

1178
00:42:17,460 --> 00:42:18,900
Ri was the only one...

1179
00:42:19,520 --> 00:42:20,820
who wore high heels.

1180
00:42:20,820 --> 00:42:23,270
How could someone
who majored in dance...

1181
00:42:23,360 --> 00:42:25,090
be so bad at dancing?

1182
00:42:25,570 --> 00:42:28,940
I am suspicious of So Min.

1183
00:42:28,940 --> 00:42:31,000
I am no one.

1184
00:42:31,270 --> 00:42:33,900
You are Clacking Ghost.

1185
00:42:34,810 --> 00:42:37,380
Complete Clacking Ghost's mission.

1186
00:42:37,920 --> 00:42:39,420
He is so immature.

1187
00:42:39,420 --> 00:42:40,590
(Suk Jin is a 54-year-old
who loves these pranks.)

1188
00:42:40,840 --> 00:42:41,920
Five,

1189
00:42:42,110 --> 00:42:43,210
four,

1190
00:42:43,560 --> 00:42:44,590
three,

1191
00:42:44,920 --> 00:42:45,960
two,

1192
00:42:46,290 --> 00:42:47,750
- one.
- Start.

1193
00:42:48,230 --> 00:42:49,730
The race has started.

1194
00:42:50,520 --> 00:42:51,560
This is scary.

1195
00:42:51,790 --> 00:42:54,320
(As it did in the scary story,)

1196
00:42:54,320 --> 00:42:59,500
(darkness falls at the TV station.)

1197
00:42:59,500 --> 00:43:01,340
Where is the legendary proposal?

1198
00:43:01,940 --> 00:43:05,210
This place is really spooky.

1199
00:43:05,770 --> 00:43:07,710
It feels as though
a ghost would come out.

1200
00:43:08,040 --> 00:43:10,340
Gosh, it's really spooky here.

1201
00:43:10,340 --> 00:43:11,480
(This place is spooky as well.)

1202
00:43:11,480 --> 00:43:12,710
It's really scary.

1203
00:43:13,340 --> 00:43:15,040
I need to look for hints.

1204
00:43:15,040 --> 00:43:16,150
(He talks to himself out of fear.)

1205
00:43:16,150 --> 00:43:18,150
(The TV station is eerily quiet.)

1206
00:43:18,150 --> 00:43:19,190
Gosh, that startled me.

1207
00:43:20,150 --> 00:43:21,290
Gosh, that startled me.

1208
00:43:22,250 --> 00:43:25,130
(He got startled
by his reflection in the mirror!)

1209
00:43:25,130 --> 00:43:28,130
(I didn't expect to see myself.)

1210
00:43:28,130 --> 00:43:30,040
(After surprise comes...)

1211
00:43:30,040 --> 00:43:31,090
(embarrassment.)

1212
00:43:31,090 --> 00:43:33,610
Please don't film me for a second.
I am sorry.

1213
00:43:34,570 --> 00:43:35,670
(I want to be alone.)

1214
00:43:35,670 --> 00:43:37,500
I am sorry.
Please leave me for a second.

1215
00:43:38,610 --> 00:43:41,000
You can go to the restroom
if you want.

1216
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:43,040
(So Min is busy looking for hints.)

1217
00:43:43,040 --> 00:43:45,440
I need to find hints. Hints.

1218
00:43:46,150 --> 00:43:47,380
Hints.

1219
00:43:50,110 --> 00:43:52,860
(She found one!)

1220
00:43:53,380 --> 00:43:54,380
I found it.

1221
00:43:55,960 --> 00:43:57,920
(The assistant director is
under 40.)

1222
00:43:57,920 --> 00:43:59,420
(Suk Jin, Jae Suk, Jong Kook,
and Haha are excluded.)

1223
00:43:59,730 --> 00:44:02,690
(According to the hint, one of them
is the assistant director.)

1224
00:44:02,820 --> 00:44:04,400
I will look for more.
There should be more.

1225
00:44:04,400 --> 00:44:05,460
I think there will be a lot.

1226
00:44:05,790 --> 00:44:07,110
Hey.

1227
00:44:07,770 --> 00:44:09,980
- Which floor are you going to?
- The first floor.

1228
00:44:09,980 --> 00:44:11,110
The first floor? Me too.

1229
00:44:11,110 --> 00:44:12,130
Why are you going
to the first floor?

1230
00:44:12,500 --> 00:44:13,570
(Well...)

1231
00:44:13,570 --> 00:44:15,500
I want to see what's on that floor.
Hey, So Min.

1232
00:44:15,500 --> 00:44:16,770
I am on the sixth floor.
Where are you?

1233
00:44:16,770 --> 00:44:18,250
I am going to the first floor.

1234
00:44:18,270 --> 00:44:19,440
Why?

1235
00:44:20,190 --> 00:44:21,440
It just became that way.

1236
00:44:21,440 --> 00:44:23,420
Come on. Why are you doing that?

1237
00:44:23,420 --> 00:44:24,790
Come to the first floor.

1238
00:44:24,790 --> 00:44:26,980
- I have something to tell you.
- So Min, come to the first floor.

1239
00:44:26,980 --> 00:44:28,060
(Baritone voice)

1240
00:44:28,060 --> 00:44:29,060
(I recognize that voice.)

1241
00:44:29,060 --> 00:44:30,090
I am on my way.

1242
00:44:31,750 --> 00:44:33,130
I am hanging up!

1243
00:44:33,400 --> 00:44:34,860
- Hey.
- I am on my way.

1244
00:44:36,540 --> 00:44:37,790
I need to go down.

1245
00:44:37,790 --> 00:44:39,590
(Not knowing how Se Chan feels,
she is excited.)

1246
00:44:40,270 --> 00:44:42,210
She only changed her mind
because she heard your voice.

1247
00:44:43,230 --> 00:44:44,670
- I will help you.
- What do you mean?

1248
00:44:44,940 --> 00:44:47,310
You like her, right?

1249
00:44:48,040 --> 00:44:50,020
- You think I like So Min.
- That's the case, right?

1250
00:44:50,020 --> 00:44:51,070
Of course not.

1251
00:44:51,070 --> 00:44:52,670
(Se Chan shyly shakes his head.)

1252
00:44:52,670 --> 00:44:54,480
(What would you say
if Se Chan asks you out?)

1253
00:44:54,480 --> 00:44:56,090
(I would definitely say yes.)

1254
00:44:56,690 --> 00:44:58,960
(What would you say
if So Min asks you out?)

1255
00:44:58,960 --> 00:45:00,290
(I would love that.)

1256
00:45:00,290 --> 00:45:01,820
(My goodness.)

1257
00:45:01,960 --> 00:45:04,000
(What I want
to achieve this year is...)

1258
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:05,900
(true love.)

1259
00:45:05,900 --> 00:45:08,170
(So Min, you heard that, right?)

1260
00:45:08,170 --> 00:45:09,590
- That's the case, right?
- Of course not.

1261
00:45:09,590 --> 00:45:11,230
As a viewer of the show,

1262
00:45:11,230 --> 00:45:13,460
I thought,
"Se Chan really likes So Min."

1263
00:45:13,460 --> 00:45:14,730
- "As a viewer of the show"?
- Yes.

1264
00:45:14,730 --> 00:45:15,960
- Did it seem that way?
- Yes.

1265
00:45:15,960 --> 00:45:17,270
(Jinyoung delivers
the wish of the viewers.)

1266
00:45:17,270 --> 00:45:18,610
This is insane.

1267
00:45:18,710 --> 00:45:21,040
It's like,
"There is something between them."

1268
00:45:21,040 --> 00:45:22,400
It's love that can't be.

1269
00:45:22,400 --> 00:45:23,710
- Would you please open the door?
- Okay.

1270
00:45:23,710 --> 00:45:24,820
Thank you.

1271
00:45:24,920 --> 00:45:26,690
I am good at finding things.

1272
00:45:26,690 --> 00:45:27,840
(Finding hints seems to be
as hard as love!)

1273
00:45:27,840 --> 00:45:31,380
(The competitive Eun Soo
goes through boxes.)

1274
00:45:33,250 --> 00:45:34,960
It can't be in the trash can.

1275
00:45:34,960 --> 00:45:36,290
(Ri goes through a trash can.)

1276
00:45:39,560 --> 00:45:40,590
The thing is,

1277
00:45:41,070 --> 00:45:44,400
one popular hiding place
for the hints is...

1278
00:45:44,400 --> 00:45:45,500
(He has been in the races
for 9 years.)

1279
00:45:45,500 --> 00:45:46,500
the editing room.

1280
00:45:46,500 --> 00:45:48,710
(One popular hiding place
for the hints is the editing room!)

1281
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:52,980
(Glancing around)

1282
00:45:53,250 --> 00:45:55,570
What? This is the editing room
for Running Man.

1283
00:45:56,170 --> 00:45:58,670
(He looks around the room.)

1284
00:45:58,670 --> 00:46:01,610
What? There is a camera.
There must be something in here.

1285
00:46:01,820 --> 00:46:02,920
What?

1286
00:46:02,920 --> 00:46:03,920
The R sticker.

1287
00:46:03,920 --> 00:46:04,980
That's right.

1288
00:46:06,750 --> 00:46:09,320
(He takes a look at the laptop.)

1289
00:46:09,320 --> 00:46:10,860
What? What is this?

1290
00:46:10,860 --> 00:46:12,060
(The assistant director is
under 50.)

1291
00:46:12,060 --> 00:46:14,090
What is this?
Am I supposed to see this?

1292
00:46:14,090 --> 00:46:16,670
- This is a production crew's note.
- Yes.

1293
00:46:17,190 --> 00:46:18,190
I see.

1294
00:46:18,190 --> 00:46:19,290
It's not a hint.

1295
00:46:19,690 --> 00:46:20,810
(He saw a hint by mistake.)

1296
00:46:20,810 --> 00:46:23,040
I didn't do it on purpose.

1297
00:46:24,670 --> 00:46:26,230
- Who is that?
- Gosh, that startled me.

1298
00:46:26,270 --> 00:46:28,440
Hold on. Is that a moving camera?
Kwang Soo?

1299
00:46:28,440 --> 00:46:31,670
(Se Chan spots a moving camera.)

1300
00:46:31,670 --> 00:46:33,170
(Kwang Soo must be playing a role.)

1301
00:46:33,170 --> 00:46:34,610
- I knew it.
- What is that supposed to mean?

1302
00:46:34,840 --> 00:46:37,710
- What is that supposed to mean?
- A moving camera.

1303
00:46:37,860 --> 00:46:39,980
- This is so frustrating.
- Someone else is entering.

1304
00:46:39,980 --> 00:46:41,130
Jae Suk.

1305
00:46:41,750 --> 00:46:43,360
- Did you find a hint?
- No.

1306
00:46:43,360 --> 00:46:44,960
- Didn't you find a single hint?
- How about you?

1307
00:46:45,060 --> 00:46:46,770
- I found one.
- He found one.

1308
00:46:46,860 --> 00:46:48,690
Aren't you Sprinkle?

1309
00:46:48,900 --> 00:46:50,270
Sprinkle?

1310
00:46:50,270 --> 00:46:52,690
Are you Sprinkle, Squeak, or Sullen?

1311
00:46:52,690 --> 00:46:54,040
I am no one.

1312
00:46:54,040 --> 00:46:55,040
(His very presence is suspicious.)

1313
00:46:55,040 --> 00:46:58,730
All right.
The Ghost Radio Booth is open.

1314
00:46:58,730 --> 00:46:59,900
Really?

1315
00:47:01,110 --> 00:47:04,880
(The Ghost Radio Booth
is on the 11th floor.)

1316
00:47:05,270 --> 00:47:07,480
(3 people who won
audience tickets can bring...)

1317
00:47:07,480 --> 00:47:09,380
(1 partner each
into the radio booth.)

1318
00:47:09,380 --> 00:47:10,420
(Listen to the sound carefully.)

1319
00:47:10,420 --> 00:47:12,560
(If the producer, assistant
director, Coughing Ghost,)

1320
00:47:12,560 --> 00:47:15,130
(or Clacking Ghost is in the booth,
you'll hear a special sound.)

1321
00:47:15,320 --> 00:47:16,360
We need to find
the audience tickets.

1322
00:47:16,360 --> 00:47:19,400
The four of us should go and find
the audience tickets.

1323
00:47:19,400 --> 00:47:20,900
We need those tickets
to enter the booth.

1324
00:47:20,900 --> 00:47:21,920
Where are the audience tickets?

1325
00:47:21,920 --> 00:47:24,290
There are people
who found the audience tickets.

1326
00:47:24,290 --> 00:47:26,040
- Really?
- Who are they?

1327
00:47:26,040 --> 00:47:27,860
- Kwang Soo, you have been called.
- Me?

1328
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:29,900
- It's understandable.
- You are suspicious.

1329
00:47:29,900 --> 00:47:30,980
Go.

1330
00:47:32,310 --> 00:47:33,540
What is this?

1331
00:47:33,810 --> 00:47:35,070
(Ji Hyo found
a strange envelope earlier.)

1332
00:47:37,040 --> 00:47:39,880
No way. It's an audience ticket.

1333
00:47:40,820 --> 00:47:42,020
I choose Kwang Soo.

1334
00:47:42,650 --> 00:47:44,060
I choose Haha.

1335
00:47:44,320 --> 00:47:47,130
I choose So Min.

1336
00:47:47,290 --> 00:47:49,520
- Hurry up and line up.
- Jong Kook, stop suspecting me.

1337
00:47:49,520 --> 00:47:51,630
- Hurry up.
- I am innocent.

1338
00:47:51,630 --> 00:47:53,250
Stop being that way.

1339
00:47:53,250 --> 00:47:55,770
Now, who called who?

1340
00:47:55,770 --> 00:47:57,500
- I called Haha.
- You called Haha.

1341
00:47:57,500 --> 00:47:59,290
- Why did you call Haha?
- We have similar heights.

1342
00:47:59,290 --> 00:48:00,840
(We have similar heights.)

1343
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:03,230
He didn't say that earlier.

1344
00:48:03,230 --> 00:48:04,940
- No.
- When I asked him why he chose me,

1345
00:48:05,570 --> 00:48:07,340
he said,
"You seem like the producer."

1346
00:48:08,070 --> 00:48:09,340
But he said that by mistake.

1347
00:48:09,340 --> 00:48:11,480
There is no need to find
the producer.

1348
00:48:11,480 --> 00:48:14,980
That means, he is either
Coughing Ghost or Clacking Ghost.

1349
00:48:15,020 --> 00:48:16,980
I want to protect the producer.

1350
00:48:17,190 --> 00:48:19,250
What? You have no power
to protect the producer.

1351
00:48:19,250 --> 00:48:20,880
I am the strongest one
next to Jong Kook.

1352
00:48:21,320 --> 00:48:22,590
What?

1353
00:48:22,730 --> 00:48:24,420
I learned jujitsu.

1354
00:48:24,420 --> 00:48:26,290
Do you want a beating?

1355
00:48:26,820 --> 00:48:28,820
(Flinching)

1356
00:48:28,820 --> 00:48:30,790
He is ridiculous.

1357
00:48:30,790 --> 00:48:32,000
Kwang Soo is a fighter.

1358
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:33,360
You know,

1359
00:48:33,360 --> 00:48:35,360
- I am pretty strong.
- Jujitsu.

1360
00:48:35,400 --> 00:48:36,810
I won't lose easily.

1361
00:48:37,380 --> 00:48:39,670
If the producer, assistant director,
Coughing Ghost, or Clacking Ghost...

1362
00:48:39,670 --> 00:48:41,110
is in the group,

1363
00:48:41,110 --> 00:48:43,270
the appointed sound will play.

1364
00:48:43,440 --> 00:48:45,840
If there are 2 or 3 of them,
will we hear multiple sounds?

1365
00:48:45,840 --> 00:48:48,440
Yes. If there is only one of them,
you will hear a single sound.

1366
00:48:48,440 --> 00:48:49,820
(All the designated sounds
will be played.)

1367
00:48:49,820 --> 00:48:51,150
I will protect you. Don't worry.

1368
00:48:51,980 --> 00:48:53,250
Let's attack Kwang Soo first.

1369
00:48:53,250 --> 00:48:55,630
Let's check
if there are ghosts in this group.

1370
00:48:55,820 --> 00:48:57,190
One.

1371
00:48:57,190 --> 00:48:59,250
(The people in this group...)

1372
00:48:59,250 --> 00:49:01,820
(will change the sounds.)

1373
00:49:01,820 --> 00:49:03,000
(Which sounds will they hear?)

1374
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:04,130
Two.

1375
00:49:04,900 --> 00:49:06,270
Three.

1376
00:49:13,840 --> 00:49:15,070
(Clacking)

1377
00:49:15,180 --> 00:49:16,510
- Clacking Ghost is here!
- Clacking Ghost.

1378
00:49:17,030 --> 00:49:18,640
(There is Clacking Ghost among us!)

1379
00:49:20,180 --> 00:49:22,280
- Clacking Ghost is here?
- Hold on.

1380
00:49:22,280 --> 00:49:23,470
Really?

1381
00:49:24,680 --> 00:49:26,550
Is that all? Is Clacking Ghost
the only one in this group?

1382
00:49:26,550 --> 00:49:29,680
Clacking Ghost was wearing heels
at the time of death...

1383
00:49:29,680 --> 00:49:31,430
- Cut.
- What?

1384
00:49:31,430 --> 00:49:32,550
- That's the sound for the producer.
- "Cut."

1385
00:49:32,550 --> 00:49:34,090
(They hear "Cut.")

1386
00:49:34,090 --> 00:49:35,160
- That's the sound for the producer.
- "Cut."

1387
00:49:35,160 --> 00:49:36,760
Haha, I will protect you.

1388
00:49:36,950 --> 00:49:38,660
- Haha, it's you, right?
- Hold on.

1389
00:49:38,760 --> 00:49:40,720
- What?
- It's you.

1390
00:49:40,720 --> 00:49:43,890
Both Clacking Ghost and producer
are in this group.

1391
00:49:43,890 --> 00:49:45,430
Clacking Ghost is among us?

1392
00:49:45,430 --> 00:49:46,840
The producer is among us as well?

1393
00:49:46,840 --> 00:49:48,510
Both Clacking Ghost and the producer
are among us.

1394
00:49:49,110 --> 00:49:52,340
(Clacking Ghost and the producer
are among the 6 of them.)

1395
00:49:53,140 --> 00:49:55,550
- But... Hold on.
- That narrows down the list.

1396
00:49:55,550 --> 00:49:57,340
Hold on. Who are the members
of Team New Producer?

1397
00:49:57,340 --> 00:49:58,410
- Jae Suk.
- Jae Suk,

1398
00:49:58,410 --> 00:49:59,950
- Eun Soo, Se Chan,
- Jae Suk, Suk Jin...

1399
00:49:59,950 --> 00:50:01,050
- and Suk Jin.
- Suk Jin.

1400
00:50:01,050 --> 00:50:02,550
These four aren't ghosts.

1401
00:50:02,550 --> 00:50:03,890
They aren't ghosts.

1402
00:50:03,890 --> 00:50:04,950
Hold on.

1403
00:50:04,950 --> 00:50:07,280
- Either Ri or Jinyoung is...
- Jinyoung.

1404
00:50:07,280 --> 00:50:08,450
Coughing Ghost.

1405
00:50:08,820 --> 00:50:11,700
(They were neither at the booth
nor in Team New Producer.)

1406
00:50:11,700 --> 00:50:14,070
But we don't know
who the assistant director is...

1407
00:50:14,070 --> 00:50:16,760
- and who Coughing Ghost is.
- We don't know that.

1408
00:50:16,760 --> 00:50:21,140
(Are Ri and Jinyoung Coughing Ghost
and the assistant director?)

1409
00:50:22,030 --> 00:50:24,140
If we use the hint
we received earlier...

1410
00:50:24,140 --> 00:50:25,640
Who was the hint about?

1411
00:50:26,300 --> 00:50:28,570
"The assistant director
and producer..."

1412
00:50:28,570 --> 00:50:30,010
"aren't the youngest."

1413
00:50:30,010 --> 00:50:31,390
(The assistant director
and producer aren't the youngest.)

1414
00:50:31,840 --> 00:50:34,660
(They received the 2nd hint
in Round 2 that got edited out.)

1415
00:50:34,660 --> 00:50:37,930
(The assistant director
and producer aren't the youngest.)

1416
00:50:38,660 --> 00:50:40,550
(Ri is neither assistant director
nor the producer.)

1417
00:50:40,550 --> 00:50:43,860
Then who is Ri?
Ri is Coughing Ghost.

1418
00:50:44,300 --> 00:50:47,200
(Ri becomes
the only Coughing Ghost candidate.)

1419
00:50:47,390 --> 00:50:50,890
(Is Ri Coughing Ghost
as the members guessed?)

1420
00:50:51,030 --> 00:50:53,910
The race will resume.

1421
00:50:53,910 --> 00:50:55,070
It's Ri.

1422
00:50:55,070 --> 00:50:56,140
(He becomes certain.)

1423
00:50:56,140 --> 00:50:57,610
Ri is Coughing Ghost.

1424
00:50:58,010 --> 00:51:00,880
(All the hints suggest that
Ri is Coughing Ghost!)

1425
00:51:01,720 --> 00:51:05,610
(Everyone is searching for Ri.)

1426
00:51:06,720 --> 00:51:09,590
(Meanwhile,
Jae Suk is looking for hints.)

1427
00:51:09,760 --> 00:51:11,320
(There should be something here.)

1428
00:51:11,320 --> 00:51:12,390
Oh!

1429
00:51:13,390 --> 00:51:16,130
(He finds a hint
in the editing room!)

1430
00:51:18,260 --> 00:51:19,320
What is this?

1431
00:51:19,320 --> 00:51:20,720
(The box contains
a mysterious USB drive.)

1432
00:51:20,720 --> 00:51:21,990
It's a USB drive.

1433
00:51:21,990 --> 00:51:23,340
(The box contains
a mysterious USB drive.)

1434
00:51:24,470 --> 00:51:26,910
(He checks what's inside
using a laptop in the room.)

1435
00:51:26,910 --> 00:51:28,110
The USB drive.

1436
00:51:30,030 --> 00:51:31,030
It's a hint.

1437
00:51:31,030 --> 00:51:32,780
(There's a hint video
in the USB drive.)

1438
00:51:34,610 --> 00:51:36,610
(He checks the video in the USB.)

1439
00:51:36,610 --> 00:51:38,240
(What Running Man members
must know for tomorrow's shoot)

1440
00:51:38,950 --> 00:51:42,510
Even if it's late, did you tell her
about the ghost story?

1441
00:51:42,890 --> 00:51:45,390
How could I tell her
when she just joined our show?

1442
00:51:46,130 --> 00:51:47,180
Ri.

1443
00:51:47,180 --> 00:51:49,430
(Someone approaches Ri.)

1444
00:51:50,200 --> 00:51:51,990
I came back from that place.
Did you hear?

1445
00:51:54,090 --> 00:51:56,390
Didn't you guys twist
the story too much?

1446
00:51:56,390 --> 00:51:57,970
(This is the preview
from last week.)

1447
00:51:58,340 --> 00:51:59,660
- Shall we go? Let's go.
- Yes.

1448
00:52:02,430 --> 00:52:04,140
(Ghost Story at TV Station:
Legendary Proposal)

1449
00:52:04,570 --> 00:52:06,050
What is this?

1450
00:52:06,300 --> 00:52:07,780
(He's disappointed by
last week's preview.)

1451
00:52:07,780 --> 00:52:09,220
What am I suppose...

1452
00:52:10,910 --> 00:52:14,010
(It's continued by
a mysterious video.)

1453
00:52:15,410 --> 00:52:17,410
(What's this?)

1454
00:52:19,220 --> 00:52:21,720
(Clacking Ghost, "Where did they
hide the proposal?")

1455
00:52:21,720 --> 00:52:27,130
(Coughing Ghost, "People call us
ghosts because we wander at night.")

1456
00:52:27,130 --> 00:52:29,300
(Can you not wear those shoes?)

1457
00:52:29,300 --> 00:52:32,010
(Clacking Ghost, "Go see a doctor
instead of coughing all the time.")

1458
00:52:32,010 --> 00:52:34,110
(Search for it
early tomorrow morning.)

1459
00:52:35,200 --> 00:52:37,010
(In the video,)

1460
00:52:37,010 --> 00:52:39,910
(the two have
a mysterious conversation.)

1461
00:52:40,340 --> 00:52:41,570
It's you.

1462
00:52:42,820 --> 00:52:44,220
(Tearing)

1463
00:52:46,510 --> 00:52:47,610
Right?

1464
00:52:48,410 --> 00:52:50,680
(Choi Ri is eliminated by someone.)

1465
00:52:51,660 --> 00:52:54,220
Clacking Ghost and
Coughing Ghost are not ghosts.

1466
00:52:56,530 --> 00:52:57,530
Right?

1467
00:52:57,760 --> 00:52:59,160
No, I'm not.

1468
00:52:59,160 --> 00:53:01,200
(Who is Choi Ri?)

1469
00:53:01,200 --> 00:53:03,930
(She's not Coughing Ghost.)

1470
00:53:04,200 --> 00:53:06,010
"Dalim Man" production crew
member, Choi Ri is eliminated.

1471
00:53:06,010 --> 00:53:08,970
- What?
- Choi Ri is eliminated.

1472
00:53:08,970 --> 00:53:11,030
- Ri is part of the production crew.
- What?

1473
00:53:11,610 --> 00:53:13,050
(Choi Ri is a regular crew member.)

1474
00:53:13,050 --> 00:53:14,640
Was she a production crew member?

1475
00:53:15,220 --> 00:53:17,610
What? Aren't they human?

1476
00:53:17,610 --> 00:53:20,410
(Clacking Ghost and
Coughing Ghost are human.)

1477
00:53:20,410 --> 00:53:25,030
(Coughing Ghost, "People call us
ghosts because we wander at night.")

1478
00:53:25,950 --> 00:53:27,930
(Some of you were eliminated
unfairly.)

1479
00:53:27,930 --> 00:53:30,050
(You were the producer
who's a ghost...)

1480
00:53:30,050 --> 00:53:33,490
(and assisting director,
Coughing Ghost and Clacking Ghost.)

1481
00:53:34,490 --> 00:53:37,430
(Is the producer the only ghost?)

1482
00:53:37,660 --> 00:53:40,340
Then it's wrong.
There aren't four ghosts.

1483
00:53:40,340 --> 00:53:42,570
(Aren't there 4 ghosts?)

1484
00:53:43,510 --> 00:53:48,050
(There are no ghosts
on Team New Producer.)

1485
00:53:48,340 --> 00:53:49,340
What?

1486
00:53:49,340 --> 00:53:52,450
(Team New Producer's 4 members
were completely exempted.)

1487
00:53:52,890 --> 00:53:54,910
(Among the producer,
assistant director,)

1488
00:53:54,910 --> 00:53:57,990
(Clacking Ghost,
and Coughing Ghost,)

1489
00:53:58,280 --> 00:54:00,780
(none of them are ghosts.)

1490
00:54:01,090 --> 00:54:04,700
(Does that mean
only the producer is a ghost?)

1491
00:54:05,530 --> 00:54:07,800
(So Min figures out that...)

1492
00:54:07,800 --> 00:54:10,700
(there aren't four ghosts.)

1493
00:54:11,700 --> 00:54:13,930
(If that's the case, Coughing Ghost
or the assistant director...)

1494
00:54:13,970 --> 00:54:15,680
(could still be
in Team New Producer.)

1495
00:54:15,680 --> 00:54:17,240
It's Coughing Ghost.

1496
00:54:17,240 --> 00:54:19,510
- Coughing and Clacking Ghost are...
- It's one of the two.

1497
00:54:19,510 --> 00:54:20,800
- Choi Ri is...
- human. Did you know that?

1498
00:54:20,800 --> 00:54:23,240
They were human?

1499
00:54:23,240 --> 00:54:25,320
There should be a twist like this.

1500
00:54:25,510 --> 00:54:28,360
I'm quite shocked
that Ri was eliminated.

1501
00:54:28,360 --> 00:54:30,720
If one more gets eliminated,
one of us can...

1502
00:54:30,720 --> 00:54:32,360
- become invincible.
- Right.

1503
00:54:32,930 --> 00:54:36,720
(If they eliminate two members,
they win a protective shield.)

1504
00:54:37,050 --> 00:54:38,470
I bet they aren't here.

1505
00:54:38,470 --> 00:54:39,760
(So Min is looking for
another hint.)

1506
00:54:40,800 --> 00:54:42,200
Is there such a thing?

1507
00:54:42,200 --> 00:54:43,390
(Did she find something?)

1508
00:54:43,390 --> 00:54:44,590
(Proposal)

1509
00:54:44,590 --> 00:54:47,930
(The legendary proposal is hidden
somewhere in the TV station.)

1510
00:54:47,930 --> 00:54:51,340
(The production crew wins
if they put it in the safe.)

1511
00:54:51,950 --> 00:54:54,950
(If Coughing or Clacking Ghost
eliminates the producer...)

1512
00:54:54,950 --> 00:54:57,720
(or signs the legendary proposal,
they win.)

1513
00:54:58,450 --> 00:55:00,090
(She finds a document
that looks like a proposal.)

1514
00:55:00,090 --> 00:55:02,280
Jae Suk. Hey!

1515
00:55:02,910 --> 00:55:06,430
(So Min gets eliminated by someone
when she finds the document.)

1516
00:55:07,260 --> 00:55:09,360
(Sighing)

1517
00:55:09,360 --> 00:55:11,260
I don't think this is the proposal.

1518
00:55:12,260 --> 00:55:16,200
(What So Min found wasn't
the legendary proposal.)

1519
00:55:16,760 --> 00:55:19,840
"Dalim Man" production crew,
So Min is eliminated.

1520
00:55:19,840 --> 00:55:21,570
- Is she out?
- She is.

1521
00:55:21,570 --> 00:55:23,200
(Someone is getting closer
to getting the protective shield.)

1522
00:55:23,200 --> 00:55:25,110
- My goodness.
- Is So Min's name tag torn off?

1523
00:55:25,110 --> 00:55:26,300
Hers got torn off.

1524
00:55:26,300 --> 00:55:27,300
(They must hurry and find
Coughing Ghost and Clacking Ghost.)

1525
00:55:27,800 --> 00:55:29,880
(Eun Soo is looking for hints.)

1526
00:55:31,320 --> 00:55:33,780
(She finds a hint.)

1527
00:55:36,180 --> 00:55:37,360
"Clacking Ghost is"...

1528
00:55:37,720 --> 00:55:39,720
(Clacking Ghost is blood type A.
Jong Kook, Ji Hyo, Kwang Soo)

1529
00:55:39,720 --> 00:55:41,530
("Clacking Ghost is blood type A"?)

1530
00:55:41,720 --> 00:55:43,200
(Those with blood type A)

1531
00:55:43,200 --> 00:55:46,160
(Only Kwang Soo, Ji Hyo,
and Jong Kook)

1532
00:55:46,970 --> 00:55:49,340
I'll go upstairs again.

1533
00:55:49,340 --> 00:55:50,800
(Clacking Ghost candidates are
narrowed down to 3 members.)

1534
00:55:51,760 --> 00:55:52,800
Who is it?

1535
00:55:53,510 --> 00:55:55,340
It's Kwang Soo. Hello?

1536
00:55:56,610 --> 00:55:57,840
Are you alone?

1537
00:55:59,180 --> 00:56:02,320
(He checks if Se Chan is alone.)

1538
00:56:04,110 --> 00:56:05,740
What's wrong? You're scaring me.

1539
00:56:05,910 --> 00:56:07,990
- Are you alone?
- Yes, I'm alone.

1540
00:56:07,990 --> 00:56:10,910
I can't see anyone.
I've been walking alone.

1541
00:56:10,910 --> 00:56:13,180
I'll go to the ninth floor.

1542
00:56:13,180 --> 00:56:14,860
- Okay.
- All right, Kwang Soo.

1543
00:56:17,050 --> 00:56:21,030
(Alluring Se Chan,
is Kwang Soo Clacking Ghost?)

1544
00:56:23,070 --> 00:56:24,860
(Ji Hyo is walking around
the building.)

1545
00:56:24,860 --> 00:56:27,610
(She spots Jong Kook.)

1546
00:56:28,910 --> 00:56:32,050
(Both of them are
Clacking Ghost candidates.)

1547
00:56:34,970 --> 00:56:37,140
(They guard themselves
from one another.)

1548
00:56:37,140 --> 00:56:39,320
Go upstairs.

1549
00:56:39,320 --> 00:56:40,450
- Where are you going?
- Is it you?

1550
00:56:40,450 --> 00:56:42,160
I'm not. Go upstairs.

1551
00:56:42,160 --> 00:56:43,950
Are you going to tear off
my name tag when I do?

1552
00:56:45,450 --> 00:56:47,660
If that were the case,
I'd do it already.

1553
00:56:48,220 --> 00:56:51,090
(Among the 3,
who is Clacking Ghost?)

1554
00:56:51,860 --> 00:56:53,990
Wait, there's something here.

1555
00:56:54,800 --> 00:56:56,490
(He finds a hint.)

1556
00:56:57,800 --> 00:57:00,410
(The producer is blood type A.
Jong Kook, Ji Hyo, Kwang Soo)

1557
00:57:00,410 --> 00:57:03,510
(Is the producer blood type A?)

1558
00:57:04,680 --> 00:57:07,700
(The producer is
among the 3 of them.)

1559
00:57:08,340 --> 00:57:09,610
(Two of them are the producer
and Clacking Ghost.)

1560
00:57:09,610 --> 00:57:11,240
- What's wrong?
- What?

1561
00:57:11,240 --> 00:57:13,840
Why did you come here?
I said I'd come downstairs.

1562
00:57:14,910 --> 00:57:16,510
(Is he pulling up his sleeves?)

1563
00:57:17,950 --> 00:57:20,720
(He's ready.)

1564
00:57:21,800 --> 00:57:23,800
(What's going on with him?)

1565
00:57:23,800 --> 00:57:24,930
Wait.

1566
00:57:25,220 --> 00:57:27,030
Why did you come
to the emergency exit?

1567
00:57:27,030 --> 00:57:28,840
There are too many people
over there.

1568
00:57:29,070 --> 00:57:30,340
Why did you come here?

1569
00:57:30,340 --> 00:57:31,930
Didn't you see me come here
from out there?

1570
00:57:31,930 --> 00:57:33,610
- I didn't see you.
- Did you just come?

1571
00:57:33,610 --> 00:57:35,140
Go upstairs then.

1572
00:57:35,880 --> 00:57:38,640
- The elevator isn't here yet.
- When it comes, go upstairs.

1573
00:57:39,700 --> 00:57:42,510
Don't pull up your sleeves.

1574
00:57:42,880 --> 00:57:46,720
Don't. You're hurting me, Kwang Soo.

1575
00:57:48,820 --> 00:57:50,820
(He takes control over him
immediately.)

1576
00:57:50,820 --> 00:57:51,930
(As soon as Se Chan falls over...)

1577
00:57:51,930 --> 00:57:53,180
(Tearing)

1578
00:57:53,390 --> 00:57:54,930
(He tears off Se Chan's name tag.)

1579
00:57:55,590 --> 00:57:58,050
(Se Chan is out instantly.)

1580
00:57:58,990 --> 00:57:59,990
Are you okay?

1581
00:57:59,990 --> 00:58:01,760
- Are you okay?
- I'm okay.

1582
00:58:01,760 --> 00:58:02,990
(Is Kwang Soo Clacking Ghost?)

1583
00:58:03,700 --> 00:58:05,760
- Go.
- I don't know where it is.

1584
00:58:05,760 --> 00:58:06,800
(As soon as she shows her back...)

1585
00:58:06,800 --> 00:58:08,140
Ji Hyo.

1586
00:58:08,140 --> 00:58:09,930
(He sees his opportunity.)

1587
00:58:10,430 --> 00:58:11,610
(Tearing)

1588
00:58:12,610 --> 00:58:14,970
(Clacking Ghost and producer
candidate, Ji Hyo is out.)

1589
00:58:14,970 --> 00:58:16,240
Ji Hyo.

1590
00:58:16,240 --> 00:58:18,410
(Who is Ji Hyo?)

1591
00:58:18,510 --> 00:58:21,410
"Dalim Man" production crew
member, Ji Hyo is eliminated.

1592
00:58:22,220 --> 00:58:23,260
I'm sorry.

1593
00:58:23,260 --> 00:58:25,050
("Dalim Man" production crew
member, Ji Hyo is out.)

1594
00:58:25,050 --> 00:58:27,720
(Ji Hyo was a regular crew member.)

1595
00:58:27,720 --> 00:58:30,430
- Are you okay? When I grabbed,
- Yes, but what happened?

1596
00:58:30,430 --> 00:58:31,630
you were so strong.

1597
00:58:31,630 --> 00:58:32,860
- Who are you?
- I had no other solution.

1598
00:58:32,860 --> 00:58:34,130
Are you Clacking Ghost?

1599
00:58:36,200 --> 00:58:39,030
(Only Kwang Soo and Jong Kook remain
as candidates.)

1600
00:58:39,800 --> 00:58:41,030
No, Ji Hyo.

1601
00:58:41,030 --> 00:58:42,030
(One is Clacking Ghost,
and the other is the producer.)

1602
00:58:42,030 --> 00:58:43,070
Ji Hyo.

1603
00:58:43,430 --> 00:58:44,680
(Who are they?)

1604
00:58:44,680 --> 00:58:46,410
I can't trust anyone.

1605
00:58:46,410 --> 00:58:47,410
(Who are they?)

1606
00:58:49,410 --> 00:58:52,510
"Dalim Man" production crew,
Ji Hyo and Se Chan are out.

1607
00:58:52,510 --> 00:58:54,610
- Goodness.
- Wait a minute.

1608
00:58:54,610 --> 00:58:56,890
Two of them have
a protective shield.

1609
00:58:56,890 --> 00:58:58,450
(Two of them have
a protective shield.)

1610
00:58:59,220 --> 00:59:02,320
(They obtain protective shield
after eliminating 2 members.)

1611
00:59:02,320 --> 00:59:04,450
- Wait a minute.
- Okay, Jae Suk.

1612
00:59:04,450 --> 00:59:06,070
- Everyone was over there.
- In that case...

1613
00:59:06,070 --> 00:59:07,160
Wait a minute.

1614
00:59:07,300 --> 00:59:09,800
(Two of them have
a protective shield.)

1615
00:59:11,090 --> 00:59:12,800
I don't know who the other one is.

1616
00:59:14,070 --> 00:59:15,880
(Who's the other one?)

1617
00:59:16,410 --> 00:59:17,430
You startled me.

1618
00:59:19,070 --> 00:59:21,140
How could you? That makes me sad.

1619
00:59:21,140 --> 00:59:22,140
(His cold reaction makes him sad.)

1620
00:59:22,380 --> 00:59:23,820
That makes me sad. You saw me.

1621
00:59:23,820 --> 00:59:25,140
You startled me.

1622
00:59:25,890 --> 00:59:26,950
Who are you?

1623
00:59:27,320 --> 00:59:30,320
I'm nothing.
I'm a production crew member.

1624
00:59:30,820 --> 00:59:32,720
I saw on TV that...

1625
00:59:32,720 --> 00:59:34,320
- No.
- you're the bad guy.

1626
00:59:34,720 --> 00:59:36,390
I'm not a bad guy.

1627
00:59:36,530 --> 00:59:37,590
No, it's not me.

1628
00:59:37,590 --> 00:59:38,590
- Really?
- Yes.

1629
00:59:38,590 --> 00:59:40,200
She's out.

1630
00:59:40,200 --> 00:59:42,070
(The rest of the members get
more confused.)

1631
00:59:42,070 --> 00:59:43,090
Goodness.

1632
00:59:43,490 --> 00:59:45,510
- Is Ji Hyo out?
- I knew it wasn't her.

1633
00:59:45,510 --> 00:59:46,740
Did hers get torn off?

1634
00:59:46,760 --> 00:59:49,110
I can't trust anyone.

1635
00:59:49,110 --> 00:59:50,700
I have to find the proposal soon.

1636
00:59:52,300 --> 00:59:53,300
(The way to win the game is...)

1637
00:59:53,300 --> 00:59:57,070
I have to do it now. I have to.

1638
00:59:57,470 --> 00:59:59,780
- Both of them are invincible.
- Let's split and search.

1639
00:59:59,780 --> 01:00:01,240
We have to find the proposal soon.

1640
01:00:02,510 --> 01:00:04,110
(Jae Suk was looking for
the proposal.)

1641
01:00:05,280 --> 01:00:07,720
(He finds a hint.)

1642
01:00:10,430 --> 01:00:11,970
"The assistant director is a woman."

1643
01:00:11,970 --> 01:00:13,660
(Ji Hyo, So Min, Eun Soo,
and Choi Ri)

1644
01:00:13,990 --> 01:00:16,590
(Is the assistant director a woman?)

1645
01:00:17,030 --> 01:00:18,970
Eun Soo... Choi Ri is out.

1646
01:00:18,970 --> 01:00:20,800
Is it Eun Soo?

1647
01:00:20,930 --> 01:00:22,180
Clacking Ghost.

1648
01:00:22,180 --> 01:00:23,340
(The assistant director is Eun Soo!)

1649
01:00:23,340 --> 01:00:24,570
Clacking Ghost.

1650
01:00:24,570 --> 01:00:28,720
(Eun Soo is the assistant director
who made the proposal.)

1651
01:00:30,070 --> 01:00:34,180
Today is Ghost Story at TV Station:
Legendary Proposal Race.

1652
01:00:34,180 --> 01:00:35,760
You're the assistant director.

1653
01:00:38,530 --> 01:00:40,660
How will I find the proposal here?

1654
01:00:41,160 --> 01:00:45,090
I have to find Clacking Ghost
and Coughing Ghost quickly.

1655
01:00:46,760 --> 01:00:48,800
- Eun Soo is the assistant director.
- So Min's out.

1656
01:00:49,300 --> 01:00:50,800
- What?
- Eun Soo is the assistant director.

1657
01:00:51,390 --> 01:00:52,700
You're Coughing Ghost.

1658
01:00:53,010 --> 01:00:54,140
My goodness.

1659
01:00:54,140 --> 01:00:56,800
- Suk Jin, you're Coughing Ghost.
- You're Coughing Ghost.

1660
01:00:57,910 --> 01:00:58,970
No.

1661
01:01:00,570 --> 01:01:02,110
(What is this?)

1662
01:01:02,110 --> 01:01:04,780
I wish I were Coughing Ghost,
but I'm not today.

1663
01:01:04,780 --> 01:01:05,780
(He's being honest.)

1664
01:01:06,010 --> 01:01:08,360
- What?
- I wish I were,

1665
01:01:08,360 --> 01:01:09,990
- but I'm not.
- You may get out.

1666
01:01:10,010 --> 01:01:11,510
Let's hold a witch trial.

1667
01:01:11,510 --> 01:01:13,630
Tear off one person's name tag,
and if he isn't it,

1668
01:01:13,630 --> 01:01:17,320
Coughing Ghost will be
someone out of the two left.

1669
01:01:17,320 --> 01:01:20,760
Goodness, we must find out
one of them now.

1670
01:01:20,760 --> 01:01:22,590
We have to tear
Coughing Ghost's name tag.

1671
01:01:22,590 --> 01:01:24,070
Why are you in such a hurry?

1672
01:01:24,570 --> 01:01:25,760
- I'm not it.
- You seem at ease.

1673
01:01:25,760 --> 01:01:26,760
Are you Coughing Ghost?

1674
01:01:26,760 --> 01:01:28,110
I'm neither of them.

1675
01:01:29,200 --> 01:01:30,410
What are you doing?

1676
01:01:32,550 --> 01:01:34,570
Then Se Chan isn't it either.

1677
01:01:35,050 --> 01:01:37,070
(He spots a camera.)

1678
01:01:37,680 --> 01:01:39,780
(What is that camera doing here?)

1679
01:01:40,180 --> 01:01:43,160
(Everyone relies on
the location of the camera.)

1680
01:01:43,410 --> 01:01:45,780
(There must be something here.)

1681
01:01:49,530 --> 01:01:51,530
Hold on. What is this?

1682
01:01:52,200 --> 01:01:53,700
What is this?

1683
01:01:53,700 --> 01:01:56,760
(There is a file folder
with the R sticker.)

1684
01:01:56,990 --> 01:01:58,090
(This is incredible!)

1685
01:01:58,090 --> 01:01:59,160
This is incredible.

1686
01:02:00,430 --> 01:02:01,660
(He opens the file folder
in secret.)

1687
01:02:01,660 --> 01:02:03,800
This is incredible.

1688
01:02:04,180 --> 01:02:05,700
(This is incredible!)

1689
01:02:06,380 --> 01:02:07,780
(However)

1690
01:02:07,780 --> 01:02:11,450
(It's not a proposal, but a security
guard's work schedule.)

1691
01:02:13,240 --> 01:02:14,890
"A complaint was made
regarding a coughing sound..."

1692
01:02:14,890 --> 01:02:16,110
"in the editing room."

1693
01:02:16,360 --> 01:02:17,550
July 16.

1694
01:02:18,550 --> 01:02:21,720
"A complaint was made
about litter..."

1695
01:02:22,260 --> 01:02:24,860
"such as medicine and masks
in front of editing room number 41."

1696
01:02:25,200 --> 01:02:28,200
(The owner of editing room number 41
coughs and takes medicine.)

1697
01:02:28,640 --> 01:02:31,260
Room number 40, 41, and 42...

1698
01:02:31,360 --> 01:02:32,660
are lined up.

1699
01:02:33,300 --> 01:02:35,680
Due to the coughing sound
from editing room number 41,

1700
01:02:35,680 --> 01:02:38,700
editing rooms number 40 and 42
made complaints.

1701
01:02:39,380 --> 01:02:40,840
Inside that room must be
the information.

1702
01:02:41,610 --> 01:02:42,970
(Haha heads over
to the editing room.)

1703
01:02:42,970 --> 01:02:44,410
- Take me out.
- Take you out?

1704
01:02:44,410 --> 01:02:45,450
Hold on.

1705
01:02:45,610 --> 01:02:47,340
- Once you take me out,
- Really?

1706
01:02:47,340 --> 01:02:49,180
- you will know.
- He can't be Coughing Ghost.

1707
01:02:49,180 --> 01:02:51,280
- He can't be Coughing Ghost.
- Then it's Jae Suk.

1708
01:02:51,280 --> 01:02:52,430
Then it's Suk Jin.

1709
01:02:52,530 --> 01:02:53,590
- I am not it.
- I am not it.

1710
01:02:53,590 --> 01:02:54,680
Suk Jin isn't...

1711
01:02:54,680 --> 01:02:55,990
- I am not it.
- Coughing Ghost.

1712
01:02:56,090 --> 01:02:57,130
- Why?
- What?

1713
01:02:57,700 --> 01:02:59,470
(Kwang Soo is certain that
Suk Jin isn't Coughing Ghost.)

1714
01:02:59,470 --> 01:03:00,700
Hold on. What makes you certain?

1715
01:03:01,360 --> 01:03:02,800
What makes you certain
he isn't Coughing Ghost?

1716
01:03:02,800 --> 01:03:04,570
(Kwang Soo looks torn.)

1717
01:03:05,840 --> 01:03:06,930
(Meanwhile, Haha arrives
at the editing rooms.)

1718
01:03:06,930 --> 01:03:08,880
Editing rooms 39 and 30.

1719
01:03:10,510 --> 01:03:11,610
Room 41.

1720
01:03:11,880 --> 01:03:13,010
This is it.

1721
01:03:13,010 --> 01:03:15,280
(He arrives at editing room
number 41.)

1722
01:03:15,280 --> 01:03:17,010
It said there was litter...

1723
01:03:17,720 --> 01:03:20,050
such as medicine and mask
at the editing room number 41.

1724
01:03:20,050 --> 01:03:21,450
What makes you certain
he isn't Coughing Ghost?

1725
01:03:22,160 --> 01:03:23,610
The assistant director is under 50.

1726
01:03:23,950 --> 01:03:25,110
The assistant director is a woman.

1727
01:03:25,110 --> 01:03:27,550
- The assistant director is a woman.
- Eun Soo is the assistant director.

1728
01:03:27,550 --> 01:03:28,590
(Is Eun Soo the assistant director?)

1729
01:03:28,590 --> 01:03:29,590
She is the assistant director.

1730
01:03:32,260 --> 01:03:35,200
(He finds a medicine packet
in editing room number 41.)

1731
01:03:36,160 --> 01:03:38,840
(He carefully opens
the medicine packet.)

1732
01:03:39,430 --> 01:03:43,110
(Cough medicine?)

1733
01:03:43,110 --> 01:03:44,200
"Assistant director".

1734
01:03:44,200 --> 01:03:46,450
(The patient is
the assistant director?)

1735
01:03:46,570 --> 01:03:49,240
(Does the cough medicine belong
to the assistant director?)

1736
01:03:50,950 --> 01:03:52,490
(What?)

1737
01:03:52,490 --> 01:03:53,950
(Assistant director)

1738
01:03:53,950 --> 01:03:56,780
(Does this editing room belong
to the assistant director?)

1739
01:03:57,280 --> 01:03:58,890
- Hold on. Don't do anything.
- Aren't you it?

1740
01:03:58,890 --> 01:04:00,130
- Aren't you Coughing Ghost?
- No!

1741
01:04:00,130 --> 01:04:02,030
- No? Then it's you!
- No!

1742
01:04:02,030 --> 01:04:04,160
(Suk Jin rips off
Jinyoung's name tag.)

1743
01:04:04,200 --> 01:04:06,320
- No.
- What?

1744
01:04:06,820 --> 01:04:07,820
He is out.

1745
01:04:07,820 --> 01:04:10,760
(Jinyoung is out.
What could be Jinyoung's identity?)

1746
01:04:10,760 --> 01:04:13,110
- Isn't he it?
- "Dalim Man"...

1747
01:04:13,300 --> 01:04:14,430
He isn't it!

1748
01:04:14,430 --> 01:04:15,840
production crew member,
Jinyoung is out.

1749
01:04:16,800 --> 01:04:19,200
(Jinyoung isn't it?)

1750
01:04:19,200 --> 01:04:20,610
production crew member,
Jinyoung is out.

1751
01:04:21,110 --> 01:04:22,570
- Jinyoung.
- I am not Coughing Ghost.

1752
01:04:22,680 --> 01:04:23,950
- You are Coughing Ghost.
- I am not Coughing Ghost.

1753
01:04:23,950 --> 01:04:25,220
- I am not Coughing Ghost.
- Get him.

1754
01:04:25,220 --> 01:04:26,780
- I am not Coughing Ghost.
- Get him.

1755
01:04:26,780 --> 01:04:28,140
- I am not Coughing Ghost.
- Hurry up and get him.

1756
01:04:28,140 --> 01:04:29,280
- No!
- It's him!

1757
01:04:29,280 --> 01:04:31,320
- He is Coughing Ghost.
- I am really not it!

1758
01:04:31,450 --> 01:04:32,630
Listen to me!

1759
01:04:32,630 --> 01:04:35,220
Listen to me! He isn't it!

1760
01:04:35,220 --> 01:04:36,630
- Get him.
- Listen to me!

1761
01:04:36,700 --> 01:04:38,860
(Suk Jin gets taken out
in an instant.)

1762
01:04:38,860 --> 01:04:40,760
- I ripped it off.
- Listen to me!

1763
01:04:40,820 --> 01:04:42,590
- I am not it!
- We got him.

1764
01:04:42,590 --> 01:04:45,140
"Dalim Man" production crew member,
Suk Jin is out.

1765
01:04:45,140 --> 01:04:46,300
I told you I am not it!

1766
01:04:46,800 --> 01:04:48,740
Listen to me!

1767
01:04:49,110 --> 01:04:52,800
(Now, Jae Suk is
the only Coughing Ghost candidate.)

1768
01:04:54,010 --> 01:04:55,180
This medicine belongs
to the assistant director.

1769
01:04:55,180 --> 01:04:57,050
(Both the medicine...)

1770
01:04:57,050 --> 01:05:01,220
(and editing room number 41
belong to the assistant director.)

1771
01:05:02,410 --> 01:05:05,390
(If the coughs
that continued on all night...)

1772
01:05:05,390 --> 01:05:07,630
(belonged
to the assistant director...)

1773
01:05:07,630 --> 01:05:08,950
I got chills.

1774
01:05:10,300 --> 01:05:11,390
That means...

1775
01:05:11,860 --> 01:05:13,070
the assistant director is...

1776
01:05:13,930 --> 01:05:15,090
Coughing Ghost.

1777
01:05:15,130 --> 01:05:16,930
(The assistant director is
Coughing Ghost.)

1778
01:05:17,840 --> 01:05:19,010
I told you!

1779
01:05:19,070 --> 01:05:20,410
The assistant director is
Coughing Ghost.

1780
01:05:20,970 --> 01:05:22,030
- What?
- What did you say?

1781
01:05:22,340 --> 01:05:24,470
The assistant director is
Coughing Ghost?

1782
01:05:24,510 --> 01:05:27,180
- You fool!
- Why didn't you say so earlier?

1783
01:05:27,180 --> 01:05:28,780
I told you
not to rip off his name tag!

1784
01:05:28,780 --> 01:05:30,220
You should have gotten
straight to the point!

1785
01:05:30,510 --> 01:05:32,590
Then Eun Soo is Coughing Ghost!

1786
01:05:33,110 --> 01:05:34,720
Is Eun Soo both Coughing Ghost
and the assistant director?

1787
01:05:36,680 --> 01:05:39,660
(Eun Soo is the assistant director.)

1788
01:05:39,660 --> 01:05:41,660
(Her other name is Coughing Ghost.)

1789
01:05:42,050 --> 01:05:43,820
I need to find out
who the producer is.

1790
01:05:44,450 --> 01:05:46,470
One of them must be the producer.

1791
01:05:47,090 --> 01:05:49,030
(Eun Soo, the assistant director
and Coughing Ghost)

1792
01:05:49,200 --> 01:05:50,800
Today, we will have...

1793
01:05:50,800 --> 01:05:52,410
Ghost Story at TV Station:
Legendary Proposal.

1794
01:05:52,410 --> 01:05:55,800
In the story, the assistant director
got eliminated with the producer.

1795
01:05:55,800 --> 01:05:58,240
But the assistant director is
Coughing Ghost.

1796
01:05:59,380 --> 01:06:01,410
Eun Soo is the assistant director
and Coughing Ghost.

1797
01:06:01,410 --> 01:06:04,410
(She became the assistant director
and Coughing Ghost.)

1798
01:06:04,610 --> 01:06:05,820
(Eun Soo)

1799
01:06:06,180 --> 01:06:10,010
(Coughing Ghost
and the assistant director)

1800
01:06:10,320 --> 01:06:11,590
Where are...

1801
01:06:11,990 --> 01:06:14,090
Kwang Soo and Jong Kook?

1802
01:06:16,390 --> 01:06:17,820
I told you
not to rip off his name tag!

1803
01:06:17,820 --> 01:06:19,800
You should have gotten
straight to the point!

1804
01:06:19,800 --> 01:06:22,760
If the production crew
doesn't listen to the producer,

1805
01:06:23,570 --> 01:06:26,070
(Kwang Soo confesses that
he is the producer.)

1806
01:06:26,070 --> 01:06:27,970
what am I supposed to do?

1807
01:06:29,640 --> 01:06:30,930
- The producer?
- I am the producer.

1808
01:06:31,300 --> 01:06:33,180
- I am the producer.
- This is driving me crazy.

1809
01:06:33,180 --> 01:06:34,300
That fool!

1810
01:06:34,510 --> 01:06:36,740
- This is driving me crazy.
- Seriously. Hold on.

1811
01:06:36,740 --> 01:06:37,840
I knew from the start.

1812
01:06:38,140 --> 01:06:39,610
- What?
- I knew from the start.

1813
01:06:39,610 --> 01:06:41,820
- Then why didn't you...
- I couldn't tell anyone...

1814
01:06:41,820 --> 01:06:43,320
because I didn't know who
the ghosts were.

1815
01:06:44,010 --> 01:06:45,930
You...

1816
01:06:46,390 --> 01:06:47,930
(Angry Jong Kook appears.)

1817
01:06:47,930 --> 01:06:49,590
You...

1818
01:06:50,530 --> 01:06:51,630
You...

1819
01:06:51,800 --> 01:06:53,200
You are the absolute worst.

1820
01:06:53,820 --> 01:06:55,030
- You...
- What?

1821
01:06:55,030 --> 01:06:56,760
Seriously.

1822
01:06:57,570 --> 01:06:59,470
- What is going on?
- You're Clacking Ghost!

1823
01:06:59,470 --> 01:07:01,240
(Furious)

1824
01:07:01,240 --> 01:07:02,410
You...

1825
01:07:03,410 --> 01:07:05,140
You made a joke about
being Squeak all day long.

1826
01:07:05,550 --> 01:07:07,450
- He says he is the producer, right?
- Yes.

1827
01:07:08,050 --> 01:07:09,410
I will tell the truth now.

1828
01:07:09,880 --> 01:07:11,610
I am the producer.

1829
01:07:12,510 --> 01:07:13,890
(What? Jong Kook is the producer?)

1830
01:07:13,950 --> 01:07:15,760
- What?
- I am the producer.

1831
01:07:15,990 --> 01:07:18,610
Listen.
I didn't tell you anything...

1832
01:07:18,610 --> 01:07:19,890
- all day long, right?
- Yes.

1833
01:07:19,990 --> 01:07:21,280
I am the producer.

1834
01:07:21,660 --> 01:07:23,700
He says he is the producer, right?

1835
01:07:23,760 --> 01:07:25,320
Why are you the producer?
Start talking.

1836
01:07:25,470 --> 01:07:27,300
Why?

1837
01:07:27,470 --> 01:07:28,740
Why are you the producer?

1838
01:07:28,740 --> 01:07:30,090
I received the mission this morning.

1839
01:07:31,090 --> 01:07:32,740
Is that so?
At what time did you arrive?

1840
01:07:32,760 --> 01:07:34,010
I received that mission too.

1841
01:07:34,010 --> 01:07:35,070
At what time did you arrive?

1842
01:07:35,070 --> 01:07:37,110
I arrived at 8 a.m... No, 9:30 a.m.

1843
01:07:37,240 --> 01:07:38,410
Then you arrived
at the same time as I did.

1844
01:07:38,470 --> 01:07:40,050
- Did you arrive at 9:30 a.m.?
- Yes.

1845
01:07:40,110 --> 01:07:41,950
- This is driving me crazy.
- I received the mission here.

1846
01:07:41,950 --> 01:07:44,740
Jae Suk, you know
he tricks us all the time.

1847
01:07:44,740 --> 01:07:46,720
- Gosh.
- I can't believe it.

1848
01:07:46,720 --> 01:07:49,450
When I received the mission,
I hoped...

1849
01:07:49,450 --> 01:07:51,760
- Jong Kook wouldn't be against me.
- I can't believe it.

1850
01:07:51,760 --> 01:07:53,990
Not too long ago,
we washed a car together...

1851
01:07:54,090 --> 01:07:55,130
and rebuilt our friendship.

1852
01:07:55,130 --> 01:07:56,700
- This is driving me crazy.
- We washed a car together.

1853
01:07:56,700 --> 01:07:57,990
Forget about that friendship.

1854
01:07:57,990 --> 01:07:59,700
- I can't believe it.
- Forget it.

1855
01:07:59,700 --> 01:08:01,700
- We should leave for now.
- We washed a car together.

1856
01:08:01,700 --> 01:08:02,840
Where is Eun Soo?

1857
01:08:02,840 --> 01:08:05,030
- Eun Soo.
- She needs to be taken out.

1858
01:08:05,570 --> 01:08:07,410
(One of them is the producer.)

1859
01:08:07,410 --> 01:08:09,530
Whoever the producer is,
I don't want to be in his show.

1860
01:08:11,180 --> 01:08:12,550
- Eun Soo needs to be taken out.
- Hey.

1861
01:08:12,550 --> 01:08:14,740
- Rip off Eun Soo's name tag.
- I will do that.

1862
01:08:14,740 --> 01:08:15,970
I will do it.

1863
01:08:15,970 --> 01:08:17,240
I can't believe you.

1864
01:08:17,740 --> 01:08:18,840
You...

1865
01:08:18,840 --> 01:08:20,220
(Who could be the real producer?)

1866
01:08:20,510 --> 01:08:22,910
(Jae Suk searches
for the proposal.)

1867
01:08:23,180 --> 01:08:24,320
What?

1868
01:08:25,110 --> 01:08:27,030
(He spots Eun Soo, Coughing Ghost
and the assistant director.)

1869
01:08:27,030 --> 01:08:28,160
- Jae Suk.
- Eun Soo, where are you going?

1870
01:08:28,160 --> 01:08:29,950
I am looking for the proposal.

1871
01:08:29,950 --> 01:08:31,220
Did you find the proposal?

1872
01:08:31,220 --> 01:08:32,470
No, I need to find it.

1873
01:08:34,200 --> 01:08:35,890
Why did you show up only now?

1874
01:08:37,160 --> 01:08:38,260
What?

1875
01:08:38,260 --> 01:08:39,640
What do you mean?

1876
01:08:40,360 --> 01:08:42,110
Eun Soo, I heard that
you are the assistant director.

1877
01:08:42,280 --> 01:08:43,930
- I am the assistant director?
- Yes.

1878
01:08:43,930 --> 01:08:46,010
- Now...
- Are you suspecting me?

1879
01:08:46,010 --> 01:08:47,070
I am not suspecting you.

1880
01:08:47,180 --> 01:08:48,300
Your eyes...

1881
01:08:48,300 --> 01:08:49,340
(She pretends to be calm.)

1882
01:08:50,340 --> 01:08:52,110
The assistant director is
on our side.

1883
01:08:52,110 --> 01:08:53,320
That's right.

1884
01:08:53,450 --> 01:08:55,010
I am the assistant director.

1885
01:08:55,140 --> 01:08:56,260
Is that so?

1886
01:08:56,510 --> 01:08:58,780
(She takes the bait.)

1887
01:09:00,450 --> 01:09:02,050
I heard that the assistant director
is Coughing Ghost.

1888
01:09:03,450 --> 01:09:05,390
- The producer is Coughing Ghost?
- Yes.

1889
01:09:06,590 --> 01:09:07,860
How is that possible?

1890
01:09:09,160 --> 01:09:10,570
That's what I heard.

1891
01:09:11,970 --> 01:09:13,110
Jae Suk!

1892
01:09:13,410 --> 01:09:14,530
Rip off her name tag!

1893
01:09:14,760 --> 01:09:15,880
Rip off her name tag!

1894
01:09:16,510 --> 01:09:17,680
- Rip off her name tag!
- Eun Soo!

1895
01:09:18,200 --> 01:09:19,400
Rip off Eun Soo's name tag!

1896
01:09:19,550 --> 01:09:21,070
Eun Soo is it. Rip off her name tag.

1897
01:09:21,070 --> 01:09:22,310
Jae Suk, Clacking Ghost...

1898
01:09:22,410 --> 01:09:24,570
Clacking Ghost, Kwang Soo is
on your way. Be careful.

1899
01:09:25,070 --> 01:09:26,240
They think I should take you out.

1900
01:09:26,390 --> 01:09:28,020
Me? Why would you do that?

1901
01:09:29,590 --> 01:09:33,480
- If you take me out...
- Are you Coughing Ghost?

1902
01:09:33,850 --> 01:09:35,730
You are scaring me.

1903
01:09:35,850 --> 01:09:38,490
- Stop it. Gosh, stop it.
- Hold on.

1904
01:09:38,490 --> 01:09:40,520
- Stop it.
- Hold on. I am sorry, but...

1905
01:09:40,520 --> 01:09:41,800
Don't be like that.

1906
01:09:41,800 --> 01:09:43,300
- So many production crew members...
- No, no.

1907
01:09:43,300 --> 01:09:44,900
- Hold on.
- Jae Suk.

1908
01:09:44,900 --> 01:09:46,640
I am not it. I am not it.

1909
01:09:46,640 --> 01:09:47,640
- I am really not it.
- Eun Soo. Hold on.

1910
01:09:47,640 --> 01:09:49,600
(She lies down on the floor.)

1911
01:09:50,380 --> 01:09:52,350
(Struggling)

1912
01:09:53,240 --> 01:09:54,940
- Rip off her name tag!
- Hold on.

1913
01:09:55,070 --> 01:09:56,550
- Hold on.
- Rip off her name tag!

1914
01:09:56,550 --> 01:09:57,610
Hold on.

1915
01:09:58,070 --> 01:09:59,110
Rip off her name tag!

1916
01:09:59,110 --> 01:10:00,780
- Rip off her name tag!
- Hold on.

1917
01:10:00,780 --> 01:10:01,980
Hurry up and rip it off.

1918
01:10:02,310 --> 01:10:04,220
- Rip it off. Hurry up.
- Eun Soo.

1919
01:10:04,310 --> 01:10:05,650
- Hold on.
- See who rips it off, okay?

1920
01:10:05,650 --> 01:10:06,760
Hurry up and rip it off.

1921
01:10:06,760 --> 01:10:08,130
Hold on.

1922
01:10:08,130 --> 01:10:10,020
- Kwang Soo, rip it off.
- Eun Soo.

1923
01:10:10,450 --> 01:10:13,190
Gosh, Kwang Soo. You are incredible.

1924
01:10:13,470 --> 01:10:14,560
- Rip it off.
- Jae Suk.

1925
01:10:14,560 --> 01:10:15,990
Jae Suk, see his terrible act.

1926
01:10:16,270 --> 01:10:18,660
He is acting
when he can clearly tear it off.

1927
01:10:19,310 --> 01:10:21,340
- Rip it off.
- Kwang Soo, move out of the way.

1928
01:10:21,340 --> 01:10:22,680
- Look at Kwang Soo.
- Rip it off.

1929
01:10:22,840 --> 01:10:24,570
- Look at his act.
- Why aren't you ripping it off?

1930
01:10:24,900 --> 01:10:26,240
- Look at his act.
- Why aren't you ripping it off?

1931
01:10:26,240 --> 01:10:27,550
- Jae Suk, look at him.
- Her hair...

1932
01:10:27,550 --> 01:10:29,480
- Jae Suk, he is acting.
- Kwang Soo.

1933
01:10:29,480 --> 01:10:31,270
Kwang Soo,
why aren't you ripping it off?

1934
01:10:31,380 --> 01:10:33,390
You know Kwang Soo is good
at ripping off name tags.

1935
01:10:33,390 --> 01:10:35,110
- Kwang Soo, rip it off.
- Look at him.

1936
01:10:35,520 --> 01:10:36,850
My goodness.

1937
01:10:37,060 --> 01:10:38,760
- Jong Kook.
- I can't believe it.

1938
01:10:41,020 --> 01:10:43,900
(He easily takes out Eun Soo.)

1939
01:10:45,230 --> 01:10:47,130
(Did you rip it off?)

1940
01:10:47,470 --> 01:10:50,230
- All right.
- He is acting.

1941
01:10:50,340 --> 01:10:53,160
The assistant director
and Coughing Ghost, Eun Soo is out.

1942
01:10:53,160 --> 01:10:54,600
- Okay!
- All right.

1943
01:10:55,360 --> 01:10:57,600
(Clacking Ghost's ally,
Eun Soo is out.)

1944
01:10:57,600 --> 01:10:58,980
- Okay!
- All right.

1945
01:10:59,070 --> 01:11:00,380
- What did I tell you?
- Eun Soo, are you okay?

1946
01:11:00,380 --> 01:11:02,050
(Eun Soo showed incredible strength.)

1947
01:11:02,440 --> 01:11:04,650
- Eun Soo is so strong.
- Seriously.

1948
01:11:04,650 --> 01:11:05,890
Eun Soo is strong.

1949
01:11:05,910 --> 01:11:07,310
I am about to go crazy.

1950
01:11:07,810 --> 01:11:09,260
Why are you about to go crazy?

1951
01:11:09,390 --> 01:11:11,060
Eun Soo, please go to the prison.

1952
01:11:11,090 --> 01:11:12,220
Eun Soo, take this.

1953
01:11:12,280 --> 01:11:13,480
See you later.

1954
01:11:13,560 --> 01:11:14,760
Eun Soo...

1955
01:11:14,890 --> 01:11:16,300
must have worked out a lot.

1956
01:11:17,520 --> 01:11:18,900
- Kwang Soo.
- Eun Soo, I am sorry.

1957
01:11:18,900 --> 01:11:19,970
Kwang Soo.

1958
01:11:20,470 --> 01:11:22,440
- You are sorry?
- Why didn't you rip it off?

1959
01:11:22,440 --> 01:11:24,030
- You aren't sorry.
- Jong Kook.

1960
01:11:24,160 --> 01:11:25,970
Jae Suk, it's as clear as day!

1961
01:11:26,270 --> 01:11:27,470
How many times
do I need to tell you?

1962
01:11:27,470 --> 01:11:29,810
That's why he's putting on a show.

1963
01:11:29,810 --> 01:11:31,440
The situation a moment ago...

1964
01:11:31,510 --> 01:11:33,200
- Forget it.
- Did you not know?

1965
01:11:33,200 --> 01:11:34,940
- I didn't know.
- I'll look for the proposal.

1966
01:11:34,940 --> 01:11:36,070
Then who told you?

1967
01:11:36,070 --> 01:11:37,410
Why those...

1968
01:11:37,410 --> 01:11:38,850
(Let's find the proposal first.)

1969
01:11:39,590 --> 01:11:41,980
We'll find it
and put it in the safe.

1970
01:11:41,980 --> 01:11:44,590
(If the producer or production crew
put it in the safe, they win.)

1971
01:11:44,650 --> 01:11:46,150
But...

1972
01:11:47,850 --> 01:11:49,400
Is Running Man this hard?

1973
01:11:49,400 --> 01:11:50,730
- What?
- My head is about to explode.

1974
01:11:50,730 --> 01:11:53,430
- Isn't it about to explode?
- I wanted to get a cab and go home.

1975
01:11:54,020 --> 01:11:55,430
- I don't care about Clacking Ghost.
- I know.

1976
01:11:55,490 --> 01:11:56,990
- I don't care.
- Clacking Ghost.

1977
01:11:56,990 --> 01:11:58,400
(The situation stresses him out.)

1978
01:11:58,400 --> 01:11:59,530
I'm so stressed out.

1979
01:12:01,560 --> 01:12:02,840
Look through everything.

1980
01:12:05,380 --> 01:12:07,700
(After looking through everything,)

1981
01:12:07,700 --> 01:12:09,770
(he enters the director's office
on the 16th floor.)

1982
01:12:14,690 --> 01:12:16,150
(Impressed)

1983
01:12:16,150 --> 01:12:17,480
"X-Man."

1984
01:12:17,810 --> 01:12:19,450
(Posters of shows that
aired 10 years ago...)

1985
01:12:19,450 --> 01:12:21,060
(are on the director's wall.)

1986
01:12:21,060 --> 01:12:24,130
(Why are these posters
still on here?)

1987
01:12:24,560 --> 01:12:26,990
(Is there something behind them?)

1988
01:12:27,600 --> 01:12:29,470
(There's something common
among the three posters.)

1989
01:12:29,470 --> 01:12:30,800
"Ki Hae Kwan".

1990
01:12:31,140 --> 01:12:32,510
"Ki Hae Kwan".

1991
01:12:32,700 --> 01:12:37,980
(Is the producer for all of them
Ki Hae Kwan?)

1992
01:12:38,480 --> 01:12:40,050
How is the producer Ki Hae Kwan?

1993
01:12:40,740 --> 01:12:44,380
(Producer Ki Hae Kwan existed
whom Haha never heard of.)

1994
01:12:45,480 --> 01:12:46,650
In that case,

1995
01:12:47,020 --> 01:12:49,150
is there a videotape? Wait.

1996
01:12:51,310 --> 01:12:53,450
"Ki Hae Kwan".

1997
01:12:55,950 --> 01:12:57,450
His name is Ki Hae Kwan.

1998
01:12:58,690 --> 01:12:59,990
"Running Man"...

1999
01:12:59,990 --> 01:13:01,100
(Is it a trophy for
Producer Ki Hae Kwan?)

2000
01:13:01,100 --> 01:13:02,320
"Film Festival".

2001
01:13:03,060 --> 01:13:05,560
(Producer Ki Hae Kwan's name is
quite unusual.)

2002
01:13:06,230 --> 01:13:07,230
(Jae Suk
who eliminated Eun Soo appears.)

2003
01:13:07,230 --> 01:13:08,660
- Haha.
- What?

2004
01:13:08,660 --> 01:13:10,600
Do you know that
I eliminated the assistant director?

2005
01:13:10,600 --> 01:13:11,730
Did you?

2006
01:13:11,980 --> 01:13:14,150
Wait, Jae Suk. We don't have time.

2007
01:13:14,150 --> 01:13:16,550
- Let's find the proposal.
- First, look at this.

2008
01:13:16,550 --> 01:13:18,610
"Producer Ki Hae Kwan".

2009
01:13:18,610 --> 01:13:19,940
The producer is Ki Hae Kwan.

2010
01:13:19,940 --> 01:13:21,480
The producer wasn't Ki Hae Kwan
at that time.

2011
01:13:22,240 --> 01:13:24,780
- Is this the proposal?
- Producer of the Month is him too.

2012
01:13:26,060 --> 01:13:28,190
(Producer Ki Hae Kwan
also received an award.)

2013
01:13:28,780 --> 01:13:29,950
("Dalim Man" production crew...)

2014
01:13:29,950 --> 01:13:33,270
(must find the legendary proposal.)

2015
01:13:33,270 --> 01:13:37,030
(They have to put the proposal
in the safe.)

2016
01:13:38,100 --> 01:13:41,560
(Producer Ki Hae Kwan sounds
unnatural.)

2017
01:13:42,030 --> 01:13:44,230
(The producer's name is
Ki Hae Kwan.)

2018
01:13:44,230 --> 01:13:46,810
(He repeats it one more time.)

2019
01:13:47,310 --> 01:13:48,850
This is the proposal.

2020
01:13:48,850 --> 01:13:50,020
(This is the proposal.)

2021
01:13:50,810 --> 01:13:53,220
(Is this the proposal?)

2022
01:13:54,190 --> 01:13:56,060
(Find the legendary proposal.)

2023
01:13:56,060 --> 01:13:58,060
(Find the legendary Ki Hae Kwan.)

2024
01:13:58,280 --> 01:14:00,780
(Legendary proposal is
legendary Producer Ki Hae Kwan.)

2025
01:14:00,780 --> 01:14:04,260
(They must put Producer Ki Hae Kwan
in the safe.)

2026
01:14:05,730 --> 01:14:08,900
(The producer must put
Producer Ki Hae Kwan in the safe.)

2027
01:14:09,360 --> 01:14:14,340
("Dalim Man" production crew lose
if they put in the wrong producer.)

2028
01:14:15,440 --> 01:14:20,240
(Producer crew loses if Clacking
Ghost signs on the producer.)

2029
01:14:22,720 --> 01:14:24,610
- It's not a proposal.
- Is it a person?

2030
01:14:24,720 --> 01:14:27,410
- We must find Producer Ki Hae Kwan.
- It's Ki Hae Kwan.

2031
01:14:27,740 --> 01:14:29,150
We have to find the producer.

2032
01:14:29,150 --> 01:14:30,760
We have to put
1 of the 2 in the safe.

2033
01:14:30,760 --> 01:14:32,310
If you take a look at this...

2034
01:14:32,310 --> 01:14:33,930
What if we put in
the wrong proposal?

2035
01:14:33,930 --> 01:14:35,450
What if we put in
the wrong proposal?

2036
01:14:35,450 --> 01:14:37,520
Is that person eliminated
or is the whole race over?

2037
01:14:37,520 --> 01:14:38,950
If the wrong proposal is placed,
it's over.

2038
01:14:38,950 --> 01:14:39,990
Is everything over?

2039
01:14:40,230 --> 01:14:41,930
We have to be careful
about it as well.

2040
01:14:44,990 --> 01:14:46,160
Jong Kook.

2041
01:14:46,200 --> 01:14:47,860
Shouldn't you eliminate
other people?

2042
01:14:47,860 --> 01:14:50,270
That Clacking Ghost.

2043
01:14:51,100 --> 01:14:54,550
(They have no idea that
the proposal is the producer.)

2044
01:14:55,100 --> 01:14:56,910
Don't you think Kwang Soo is
the producer?

2045
01:14:57,880 --> 01:14:59,690
Is that why Jong Kook held him?

2046
01:14:59,780 --> 01:15:01,020
Who?

2047
01:15:01,150 --> 01:15:02,390
Kwang Soo.

2048
01:15:02,390 --> 01:15:04,560
(As confessed,
is Kwang Soo the producer?)

2049
01:15:05,560 --> 01:15:10,350
No, I was almost certain
that Kwang Soo was the producer.

2050
01:15:10,450 --> 01:15:12,990
He was hesitant about
tearing Eun Soo's name tag.

2051
01:15:13,770 --> 01:15:17,490
(He still can't understand
Kwang Soo's strange squirming.)

2052
01:15:17,490 --> 01:15:20,770
(Kwang Soo isn't so bad
at tearing off name tags.)

2053
01:15:21,440 --> 01:15:23,680
Does he have another self?

2054
01:15:23,680 --> 01:15:26,050
- Goodness.
- Let's lure him to talk.

2055
01:15:26,050 --> 01:15:28,740
Shall we listen
and see who speaks more logically?

2056
01:15:28,740 --> 01:15:29,940
All Clacking Ghost has to do...

2057
01:15:30,270 --> 01:15:32,740
is find the proposal and sign it.

2058
01:15:33,410 --> 01:15:36,610
Clacking Ghost doesn't know that
the proposal is a person.

2059
01:15:36,610 --> 01:15:38,590
Isn't it over
once he signs on the person?

2060
01:15:38,590 --> 01:15:40,190
Yes, he doesn't know.

2061
01:15:40,190 --> 01:15:41,590
- Let's go now.
- Let's go.

2062
01:15:42,190 --> 01:15:43,400
(They walk disheartened.)

2063
01:15:43,400 --> 01:15:44,560
In that case...

2064
01:15:44,560 --> 01:15:46,490
That's why
there was a marker in here.

2065
01:15:46,490 --> 01:15:47,630
(Truth or Dare starts
for the producer.)

2066
01:15:48,560 --> 01:15:49,970
Who is the producer?

2067
01:15:50,270 --> 01:15:51,730
Here's what I think.

2068
01:15:51,730 --> 01:15:53,770
The atmosphere will tell us,
so let's call them.

2069
01:15:53,770 --> 01:15:54,840
(Clacking Ghost and producer)

2070
01:15:54,840 --> 01:15:57,730
- Call the two of them?
- Let's listen to them, but...

2071
01:15:57,980 --> 01:15:59,180
(Producer Ki Hae Kwan
and Clacking Ghost appear.)

2072
01:15:59,180 --> 01:16:00,600
- Three of them are there.
- There they are.

2073
01:16:01,270 --> 01:16:02,880
Is there Jae Suk too?

2074
01:16:03,020 --> 01:16:05,050
- Wait.
- Kyung Hwan is still alive.

2075
01:16:05,070 --> 01:16:06,410
- They're here.
- Jae Suk.

2076
01:16:06,650 --> 01:16:07,850
Wait.

2077
01:16:08,610 --> 01:16:10,520
Did you find the proposal?

2078
01:16:10,760 --> 01:16:12,560
- Do you mean us?
- Did you find...

2079
01:16:12,560 --> 01:16:13,730
- What happened?
- the proposal?

2080
01:16:13,730 --> 01:16:16,230
Here's why we came downstairs.

2081
01:16:16,430 --> 01:16:18,100
The most important is...

2082
01:16:18,100 --> 01:16:19,990
Hurry and put it in now.

2083
01:16:20,100 --> 01:16:21,400
Put it in the safe.

2084
01:16:21,400 --> 01:16:22,860
- Jae Suk.
- Come on.

2085
01:16:23,060 --> 01:16:25,140
If you found it, put it in the safe.

2086
01:16:25,140 --> 01:16:26,360
Should we reveal the truth?

2087
01:16:26,900 --> 01:16:28,360
If we tell them,

2088
01:16:28,660 --> 01:16:30,510
he'll sign immediately.

2089
01:16:31,200 --> 01:16:32,770
(They can't reveal
Producer Ki Hae Kwan so hastily.)

2090
01:16:32,770 --> 01:16:33,810
Right?

2091
01:16:34,510 --> 01:16:35,940
Yes, he will sign.

2092
01:16:35,940 --> 01:16:37,150
I'll tell you this.

2093
01:16:37,350 --> 01:16:38,850
Who said that...

2094
01:16:40,240 --> 01:16:42,590
the assistant director is
Coughing Ghost?

2095
01:16:42,720 --> 01:16:44,390
- Who said it?
- You did, Kwang Soo.

2096
01:16:45,950 --> 01:16:47,980
(The assistant director is
Coughing Ghost.)

2097
01:16:47,980 --> 01:16:50,950
(Kwang Soo reveals that Coughing
Ghost is the assistant director.)

2098
01:16:51,150 --> 01:16:53,660
(He confessed it
after two people were eliminated.)

2099
01:16:53,660 --> 01:16:55,860
Remember what happened...

2100
01:16:55,860 --> 01:16:58,140
when we tore Eun Soo's name tag.

2101
01:16:58,340 --> 01:17:01,470
Was it impossible
to tear off her name tag?

2102
01:17:01,470 --> 01:17:04,510
(Jong Kook took off
Eun Soo's name tag instead.)

2103
01:17:04,700 --> 01:17:07,550
(Perhaps Jong Kook tore it later
pretending to be the producer.)

2104
01:17:07,550 --> 01:17:09,150
- It's competitive.
- Think about it.

2105
01:17:09,770 --> 01:17:12,380
Would you respect our choice?

2106
01:17:12,440 --> 01:17:14,310
- Definitely.
- Of course.

2107
01:17:14,310 --> 01:17:15,810
We'll make the conclusion.

2108
01:17:15,910 --> 01:17:17,590
Then should we...

2109
01:17:18,590 --> 01:17:21,130
(They have a fake proposal
as bait for Clacking Ghost.)

2110
01:17:21,820 --> 01:17:23,020
Please pass us.

2111
01:17:23,100 --> 01:17:24,400
Go on.

2112
01:17:24,400 --> 01:17:26,560
- Should we put it in?
- I'll stay out of it.

2113
01:17:26,560 --> 01:17:27,690
I'll stay out of it.

2114
01:17:27,690 --> 01:17:28,820
Please put it in.

2115
01:17:28,820 --> 01:17:31,230
- Are you sure?
- We found it.

2116
01:17:31,530 --> 01:17:34,200
(He approaches the safe
pretending to put in the proposal.)

2117
01:17:34,860 --> 01:17:36,340
(Jong Kook hurries them
to put it in.)

2118
01:17:36,340 --> 01:17:38,030
(Kwang Soo is frozen.)

2119
01:17:38,030 --> 01:17:39,600
Put it in now.

2120
01:17:41,200 --> 01:17:42,600
I told you before that
if you put in the wrong...

2121
01:17:42,850 --> 01:17:45,610
(At that time)

2122
01:17:45,610 --> 01:17:48,050
(Jong Kook attacks him.)

2123
01:17:48,050 --> 01:17:49,190
- Hey.
- No.

2124
01:17:49,190 --> 01:17:50,590
(Kyung Hwan is eliminated
immediately.)

2125
01:17:51,390 --> 01:17:54,350
(He attacks Kyung Hwan
when he's about to put it in.)

2126
01:17:54,650 --> 01:17:56,760
Hurry, I found it.

2127
01:17:56,760 --> 01:17:58,060
(Clacking Ghost is Jong Kook.)

2128
01:17:58,060 --> 01:17:59,600
- Where's Kwang Soo?
- I'm not it.

2129
01:17:59,600 --> 01:18:01,060
- It's him.
- Go in.

2130
01:18:01,060 --> 01:18:02,230
- Go in now.
- No.

2131
01:18:02,230 --> 01:18:04,800
- That's not it.
- Wait.

2132
01:18:04,800 --> 01:18:06,530
- It's not him.
- Who is it?

2133
01:18:06,660 --> 01:18:09,010
(Jae Suk is eliminated.)

2134
01:18:09,010 --> 01:18:10,270
- It's not him.
- Who is it?

2135
01:18:10,270 --> 01:18:12,310
- Haha, tell him now.
- Wait.

2136
01:18:12,310 --> 01:18:14,240
No, get away.

2137
01:18:14,240 --> 01:18:15,940
- It's not me.
- Get Jong Kook.

2138
01:18:15,940 --> 01:18:17,220
- What?
- Jong Kook.

2139
01:18:17,220 --> 01:18:18,610
Catch Jong Kook.

2140
01:18:18,610 --> 01:18:20,220
Catch Jong Kook. It's our chance.

2141
01:18:20,220 --> 01:18:22,150
- I knew it.
- Who are you?

2142
01:18:22,350 --> 01:18:23,690
It's Jong Kook.

2143
01:18:23,780 --> 01:18:25,090
It was him.

2144
01:18:25,090 --> 01:18:26,260
We have to catch him.

2145
01:18:26,260 --> 01:18:27,690
(If Haha tells the truth,
Jong Kook will find out.)

2146
01:18:27,690 --> 01:18:28,820
What is it?

2147
01:18:29,930 --> 01:18:31,320
- That's not it.
- What?

2148
01:18:32,260 --> 01:18:33,820
We have to put Jong Kook in now.

2149
01:18:33,820 --> 01:18:35,160
Catch and put Jong Kook in.

2150
01:18:35,160 --> 01:18:38,160
- We have to put Jong Kook in.
- We need to put the producer in.

2151
01:18:38,160 --> 01:18:39,770
- The producer?
- What?

2152
01:18:40,510 --> 01:18:42,100
We have to put the producer in?

2153
01:18:42,440 --> 01:18:43,880
What are you talking about?

2154
01:18:43,880 --> 01:18:44,980
(He said it by mistake.)

2155
01:18:44,980 --> 01:18:46,440
(Jae Suk said it by mistake.)

2156
01:18:46,570 --> 01:18:47,770
Wait.

2157
01:18:48,070 --> 01:18:49,550
Both of them are out.

2158
01:18:49,850 --> 01:18:53,780
(If Jong Kook signs on Kwang Soo,
Coughing and Clacking Ghost win.)

2159
01:18:54,390 --> 01:18:55,940
Did you get eliminated?

2160
01:18:55,940 --> 01:18:57,350
Both of them are out.

2161
01:18:57,350 --> 01:18:58,850
- I told you.
- We have to catch Jong Kook.

2162
01:18:59,090 --> 01:19:00,430
Right?

2163
01:19:00,780 --> 01:19:02,730
(Producer Ki Hae Kwan rushes
into the safe.)

2164
01:19:03,100 --> 01:19:06,470
(The game is over once
the producer goes into the safe.)

2165
01:19:07,320 --> 01:19:09,990
(Clacking Ghost tries to stop him.)

2166
01:19:09,990 --> 01:19:12,440
(Race is over.)

2167
01:19:13,900 --> 01:19:16,980
Producer and "Dalim Man"
production crew win.

2168
01:19:16,980 --> 01:19:19,230
(Producer and "Dalim Man"
production crew win.)

2169
01:19:19,230 --> 01:19:22,480
(Coughing Ghost
and Clacking Ghost lose.)

2170
01:19:22,480 --> 01:19:23,740
- Hey.
- That was close.

2171
01:19:23,910 --> 01:19:25,350
- Jong Kook.
- It was a person.

2172
01:19:25,350 --> 01:19:26,910
(However, it was a good fight.)

2173
01:19:26,910 --> 01:19:28,610
Today's Legendary Proposal Race...

2174
01:19:28,610 --> 01:19:30,110
It was unfair, wasn't it?

2175
01:19:30,480 --> 01:19:33,950
You're the producer
who was eliminated wrongfully.

2176
01:19:34,590 --> 01:19:37,190
Did Clacking and Coughing Ghost
eliminate me out of jealousy?

2177
01:19:38,060 --> 01:19:39,400
(He curses.)

2178
01:19:40,490 --> 01:19:43,340
(Kwang Soo who died unfairly
decides to take revenge.)

2179
01:19:44,230 --> 01:19:46,730
(He eliminates Choi Ri,
a likely Coughing Ghost candidate.)

2180
01:19:47,100 --> 01:19:49,770
(As a result,
one more person dies unfairly.)

2181
01:19:49,770 --> 01:19:51,880
(He eliminates Se Chan to obtain
a protective shield.)

2182
01:19:52,400 --> 01:19:55,050
(You're the producer?
You didn't have to kick my stomach.)

2183
01:19:55,740 --> 01:19:57,410
(This was an action movie.)

2184
01:19:57,520 --> 01:19:58,650
(Was I the leading actor?)

2185
01:19:58,650 --> 01:20:00,780
(No, I was the leading actor.)

2186
01:20:00,780 --> 01:20:02,910
(You're just an extra, Se Chan.)

2187
01:20:03,310 --> 01:20:05,480
Jong Kook, you're Clacking Ghost.

2188
01:20:05,480 --> 01:20:06,850
(Today's Clacking Ghost
and Coughing Ghost)

2189
01:20:07,560 --> 01:20:09,650
(Jong Kook desperately needed
the protective shield.)

2190
01:20:10,400 --> 01:20:12,350
(He uses easy So Min
as a sacrifice.)

2191
01:20:12,350 --> 01:20:13,430
You're Clacking Ghost.

2192
01:20:13,430 --> 01:20:14,660
(Aren't you Clacking Ghost?)

2193
01:20:14,660 --> 01:20:16,770
(He eliminates a member easily.)

2194
01:20:17,530 --> 01:20:21,100
(He acts with Kwang Soo
until the end.)

2195
01:20:21,100 --> 01:20:22,230
Why you...

2196
01:20:22,230 --> 01:20:24,010
- It's just the two of us.
- Did they all go up?

2197
01:20:24,380 --> 01:20:25,480
Did they go up?

2198
01:20:25,480 --> 01:20:27,680
Even if I die,
I won't let you succeed.

2199
01:20:27,770 --> 01:20:29,070
Are you Coughing Ghost?

2200
01:20:29,720 --> 01:20:31,150
Why would I be?

2201
01:20:31,810 --> 01:20:33,150
I'm Clacking Ghost.

2202
01:20:33,520 --> 01:20:35,050
Are you the producer?

2203
01:20:36,220 --> 01:20:38,560
(The producer and Clacking Ghost
start a war of nerves.)

2204
01:20:38,560 --> 01:20:42,090
The final winner of
the Legendary Proposal Race is...

2205
01:20:42,090 --> 01:20:43,760
the producer and "Dalim Man"
production crew.

2206
01:20:43,760 --> 01:20:45,130
(The producer and the "Dalim Man"
production crew win.)

2207
01:20:45,650 --> 01:20:46,860
(The production crew
turned the tables.)

2208
01:20:46,860 --> 01:20:48,770
- Good job, Kwang Soo.
- Good job.

2209
01:20:48,770 --> 01:20:50,190
(Ki Hae Kwan feels proud.)

2210
01:20:50,660 --> 01:20:52,060
(Coughing Ghost is still regretful.)

2211
01:20:52,060 --> 01:20:53,700
I saw everything.

2212
01:20:53,700 --> 01:20:54,810
It gave me goosebumps.

2213
01:20:54,810 --> 01:20:55,810
(Clacking Ghost was
difficult to crack.)

2214
01:20:55,810 --> 01:20:57,270
- Are you ready?
- Yes.

2215
01:20:57,380 --> 01:20:58,400
One.

2216
01:20:58,640 --> 01:20:59,700
Two.

2217
01:20:59,700 --> 01:21:00,700
Three.

2218
01:21:03,180 --> 01:21:05,680
(They're atoned with
a whipped cream explosion.)

2219
01:21:05,680 --> 01:21:09,150
(From wavy dance to whipped cream,
Eun Soo's day was eventful.)

2220
01:21:09,650 --> 01:21:11,260
It's mousse.

2221
01:21:12,610 --> 01:21:15,060
- Thank you, everyone.
- Thank you.

2222
01:21:15,230 --> 01:21:16,930
(We thank Seo Eun Soo, Choi Ri,
Heo Kyung Hwan, and Jinyoung.)

2223
01:21:17,150 --> 01:21:19,060
(Humans are thought to have
four types of emotions.)

2224
01:21:19,660 --> 01:21:21,490
(Joy)

2225
01:21:21,900 --> 01:21:23,690
(Anger)

2226
01:21:23,840 --> 01:21:25,660
(Sadness)

2227
01:21:25,770 --> 01:21:27,030
(And)

2228
01:21:27,030 --> 01:21:29,200
(Fun)

2229
01:21:29,440 --> 01:21:31,100
(However,)

2230
01:21:31,100 --> 01:21:33,380
(all the happiness and pleasures
in the living world are halted now.)

2231
01:21:33,380 --> 01:21:34,570
Please give me some more time!

2232
01:21:34,770 --> 01:21:36,550
(They have a limited number
of chances.)

2233
01:21:36,550 --> 01:21:38,380
(Is there a chance
to redeem their evil lives?)

2234
01:21:38,380 --> 01:21:40,150
(They must repent
of doubting and framing others,)

2235
01:21:40,150 --> 01:21:42,550
(come together,
and have a unanimous decision.)

2236
01:21:42,890 --> 01:21:46,110
(They must come up with a unanimous
decision for a filling meal.)

2237
01:21:46,590 --> 01:21:49,190
(Will all 8 of them come up
with a unanimous decision?)

2238
01:21:49,190 --> 01:21:51,320
(A fatal mistake)

2239
01:21:51,320 --> 01:21:53,270
(And the collapse
the mistake has brought upon)

2240
01:21:53,270 --> 01:21:55,800
(Can these 8 deceased members
shake off the temptation?)

2241
01:21:56,100 --> 01:21:57,730
Should I do a good deed?

2242
01:21:58,730 --> 01:22:00,140
(Along with Distrust)
