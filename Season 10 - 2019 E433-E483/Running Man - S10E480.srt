1
00:00:05,195 --> 00:00:06,564
- You're here. - Hey.

2
00:00:06,565 --> 00:00:08,064
- Hello. - Hi.

3
00:00:08,065 --> 00:00:09,264
This way. Go to the end.

4
00:00:09,265 --> 00:00:11,033
- Stop that. - Why do you stand...

5
00:00:11,034 --> 00:00:13,004
- at the end of the line these days? - What do you mean?

6
00:00:13,005 --> 00:00:14,274
You're at the end of the line.

7
00:00:14,275 --> 00:00:18,074
I think that wherever I stand becomes the new middle.

8
00:00:18,075 --> 00:00:19,873
(It doesn't matter where he stands.)

9
00:00:19,874 --> 00:00:21,243
(The center depends on where Jae Seok stands.)

10
00:00:21,244 --> 00:00:23,119
- He's so confident. - "I'm the center."

11
00:00:23,145 --> 00:00:24,813
- I'm confident. - That's nice.

12
00:00:24,814 --> 00:00:27,353
But Haha is always right next to me.

13
00:00:27,354 --> 00:00:30,083
- What? Who's next to you? - Haha is standing next to me.

14
00:00:30,084 --> 00:00:32,653
- Someone is standing there? - Come on. Why did you say that?

15
00:00:32,654 --> 00:00:35,369
(I don't see anyone there.)

16
00:00:35,625 --> 00:00:37,264
- There he goes again. - Why?

17
00:00:37,265 --> 00:00:39,094
- Jong Kook... - Where?

18
00:00:39,095 --> 00:00:41,164
- Did he get started already? - Last week...

19
00:00:41,165 --> 00:00:43,440
- That? He's still holding a grudge? - My gosh.

20
00:00:44,104 --> 00:00:47,474
(Last week, the number of candies determined the rankings.)

21
00:00:47,475 --> 00:00:48,573
(When they had to come together as a team,)

22
00:00:48,574 --> 00:00:51,003
(Haha didn't submit any candies.)

23
00:00:51,004 --> 00:00:54,243
(Without knowing this, Jong Kook gave Haha free candies.)

24
00:00:54,244 --> 00:00:55,889
(Score)

25
00:00:56,884 --> 00:00:58,753
(And Jong Kook had to face the penalty in the end.)

26
00:00:58,754 --> 00:01:02,730
(Jong Kook had to pay for trusting Haha.)

27
00:01:03,085 --> 00:01:04,154
- Who's there? - My gosh.

28
00:01:04,155 --> 00:01:05,554
- You don't see anyone? - I got goosebumps.

29
00:01:05,555 --> 00:01:07,654
- You didn't see him? - I got goosebumps.

30
00:01:07,655 --> 00:01:09,339
He's determined to punish Haha today.

31
00:01:09,464 --> 00:01:13,034
- He made everyone believe him. - Right.

32
00:01:13,035 --> 00:01:14,834
- Luckily... - That's not true, Jong Kook.

33
00:01:14,835 --> 00:01:16,763
I'm glad that he didn't show up this week.

34
00:01:16,764 --> 00:01:18,364
- Jong Kook! - I'm glad that...

35
00:01:18,365 --> 00:01:20,933
(Haha is gone from Jong Kook's heart.)

36
00:01:20,934 --> 00:01:22,780
- I'm sorry, Jong Kook. - He didn't come today.

37
00:01:22,874 --> 00:01:25,743
- Gosh, you're something else. - He's invisible.

38
00:01:25,744 --> 00:01:28,220
- The invisible guy is crazy. - My gosh, seriously.

39
00:01:28,244 --> 00:01:30,644
Jong Kook, there's someone on your left. Don't you see him?

40
00:01:30,645 --> 00:01:33,013
No. Seok Jin, why are you standing so far away?

41
00:01:33,014 --> 00:01:35,013
Come closer. You should come closer.

42
00:01:35,014 --> 00:01:36,823
Haha, come over here. Haha.

43
00:01:36,824 --> 00:01:38,623
- Seriously. - Today is not your day.

44
00:01:38,624 --> 00:01:40,800
- Let's just finish the opening. - I can do it!

45
00:01:40,994 --> 00:01:43,369
If I'm the spy today, I'll be dead.

46
00:01:44,065 --> 00:01:46,809
This means that he will sever ties with me.

47
00:01:47,464 --> 00:01:49,664
By the way, the episode will air on Se Chan's birthday.

48
00:01:49,665 --> 00:01:51,410
- It's Se Chan's birthday? - Really?

49
00:01:51,764 --> 00:01:53,474
- Thank you. - My gosh.

50
00:01:53,475 --> 00:01:54,974
- Happy birthday! - Really? Thank you.

51
00:01:54,975 --> 00:01:57,073
- Happy birthday. - You're celebrating too early.

52
00:01:57,074 --> 00:01:58,974
(It's too early to celebrate your birthday.)

53
00:01:58,975 --> 00:02:00,089
Okay.

54
00:02:00,415 --> 00:02:02,183
- So there are two weeks left... - It's too early.

55
00:02:02,184 --> 00:02:03,860
- until your birthday. - Let's skip this part.

56
00:02:04,085 --> 00:02:05,513
- On TV... - So we don't need to talk about it.

57
00:02:05,514 --> 00:02:06,789
Right. We don't.

58
00:02:07,014 --> 00:02:08,823
- Can't you talk about it? - It's too early.

59
00:02:08,824 --> 00:02:10,724
What's your plan for your birthday? Who will you spend it with?

60
00:02:10,725 --> 00:02:12,093
- Do you have any plans? - Right.

61
00:02:12,094 --> 00:02:14,554
Actually, I think I'll be alone on my birthday this year.

62
00:02:14,555 --> 00:02:17,294
- I doubt it. - Why do you say that?

63
00:02:17,295 --> 00:02:21,834
(Perhaps, you might not be alone on your birthday this year.)

64
00:02:21,835 --> 00:02:23,163
- Spend it with So Min. - So Min won't throw a surprise.

65
00:02:23,164 --> 00:02:24,463
- Right? - No, no.

66
00:02:24,464 --> 00:02:26,533
No, I won't. Don't look at me like that.

67
00:02:26,534 --> 00:02:27,903
- No. - No, I don't expect anything.

68
00:02:27,904 --> 00:02:30,019
Hey, we should all meet up on your birthday.

69
00:02:30,344 --> 00:02:32,049
- When? On my birthday? - Yes.

70
00:02:32,275 --> 00:02:33,514
We should all meet up including So Min.

71
00:02:33,515 --> 00:02:34,819
- Let's meet up. - I won't invite you.

72
00:02:35,515 --> 00:02:36,783
- I'll spend it alone. - Hey.

73
00:02:36,784 --> 00:02:38,014
Do you want to be invisible too?

74
00:02:38,015 --> 00:02:39,913
- No, no. - Do you want to be invisible too?

75
00:02:39,914 --> 00:02:41,713
(Do you want to be gone too?)

76
00:02:41,714 --> 00:02:43,623
- Jong Kook. I'll invite you. - What? I'm right here.

77
00:02:43,624 --> 00:02:44,924
- I saw that coming. - I'm here.

78
00:02:44,925 --> 00:02:46,153
- I'm right here. - You know?

79
00:02:46,154 --> 00:02:47,569
You traitor.

80
00:02:47,825 --> 00:02:50,340
- This is scary. - I'll invite you to my birthday.

81
00:02:50,425 --> 00:02:52,663
- That was hilarious. - That was scary.

82
00:02:52,664 --> 00:02:54,894
You get to enjoy your birthdays when you're a bachelor.

83
00:02:54,895 --> 00:02:56,864
Seok Jin, you should have a party soon.

84
00:02:56,865 --> 00:02:58,104
Party...

85
00:02:58,105 --> 00:03:01,834
- You'll have a party next week. - He'll pile up yakgwa on the side.

86
00:03:01,835 --> 00:03:03,503
(At his birthday party, he'll pile up yakgwa on both sides.)

87
00:03:03,504 --> 00:03:04,943
He ought to have a party.

88
00:03:04,944 --> 00:03:06,873
- He'll have a lot of refreshments. - I'll wear hanbok.

89
00:03:06,874 --> 00:03:08,713
- He'll invite singers. - I should go to his party.

90
00:03:08,714 --> 00:03:11,384
- I can go. I can go as San Seul. - San Seul should come and sing.

91
00:03:11,385 --> 00:03:13,054
- San Seul should come. - San Seul should go.

92
00:03:13,055 --> 00:03:15,014
- He needs a pig's head. - My gosh.

93
00:03:15,015 --> 00:03:16,183
Yu San Seul.

94
00:03:16,184 --> 00:03:18,753
Before you begin your race today,

95
00:03:18,754 --> 00:03:20,630
guests you'll be happy to see are waiting.

96
00:03:21,295 --> 00:03:23,364
- I heard we're having guests. - All right.

97
00:03:23,365 --> 00:03:25,933
First guest, please come on in.

98
00:03:25,934 --> 00:03:27,193
Come on in.

99
00:03:27,194 --> 00:03:29,509
(Who is the first guest?)

100
00:03:30,564 --> 00:03:32,280
(Who is it?)

101
00:03:34,474 --> 00:03:36,003
- It's Han Na. - Han Na.

102
00:03:36,004 --> 00:03:37,120
(She's back after 3 weeks.)

103
00:03:37,775 --> 00:03:41,690
(A beautiful and superb actress who's irreplaceable)

104
00:03:42,214 --> 00:03:44,014
(I stay in bed a lot at home.)

105
00:03:44,015 --> 00:03:45,454
(After revealing what she'd been up to,)

106
00:03:45,455 --> 00:03:48,590
(she left after relaxing her stiff muscles with her unique dance.)

107
00:03:49,184 --> 00:03:51,054
(And Han Na is back only after 3 weeks.)

108
00:03:51,055 --> 00:03:52,524
- My gosh. - We see her every week.

109
00:03:52,525 --> 00:03:53,623
- Han Na. - She's our friend.

110
00:03:53,624 --> 00:03:55,153
- You're part of the show now. - Han Na.

111
00:03:55,154 --> 00:03:57,063
- Han Na. - You're part of the show now.

112
00:03:57,064 --> 00:03:58,963
- Nice to see you. - Isn't she part of the show now?

113
00:03:58,964 --> 00:04:00,163
- Come here. - You look great.

114
00:04:00,164 --> 00:04:02,764
- You look great these days. - Your outfits get nicer every time.

115
00:04:02,765 --> 00:04:05,574
It hasn't been a month since Han Na was on our show.

116
00:04:05,575 --> 00:04:06,734
- Right. - Three weeks.

117
00:04:06,735 --> 00:04:08,003
- Three weeks? - It's only been three weeks.

118
00:04:08,004 --> 00:04:10,304
It's better to be here than staying in bed at home.

119
00:04:10,305 --> 00:04:12,144
(It's better to be here than staying in bed at home.)

120
00:04:12,145 --> 00:04:15,413
(Han Na shared the hardship of lounging around at home.)

121
00:04:15,414 --> 00:04:17,443
It's better to be here.

122
00:04:17,444 --> 00:04:18,913
I used to lie down on my bed in my bedroom.

123
00:04:18,914 --> 00:04:20,614
After that episode,

124
00:04:20,615 --> 00:04:22,754
- I stay in the living room now. - You did? That's great.

125
00:04:22,755 --> 00:04:24,799
- She's making progress. - Great.

126
00:04:25,255 --> 00:04:28,553
Han Na was our first guest.

127
00:04:28,554 --> 00:04:30,463
- Let's bring in the next guest. - Okay.

128
00:04:30,464 --> 00:04:31,840
Sounds good.

129
00:04:32,234 --> 00:04:33,264
Who is it?

130
00:04:33,265 --> 00:04:34,939
(The second guest after Han Na)

131
00:04:36,534 --> 00:04:38,140
(Surprised)

132
00:04:39,474 --> 00:04:41,934
(Who is the guest that made their jaws drop open?)

133
00:04:41,935 --> 00:04:45,419
(Lee Hee Jin of Baby V.O.X)

134
00:04:46,015 --> 00:04:50,119
(This 1st-generation girl group was popular in Korea and abroad.)

135
00:04:50,685 --> 00:04:56,160
(And the lead vocalist, Hee Jin, was in the center of popularity.)

136
00:04:57,625 --> 00:05:01,869
(Now, she's actively performing as an actress in many dramas.)

137
00:05:02,864 --> 00:05:04,423
My gosh, hello.

138
00:05:04,424 --> 00:05:06,939
(Hee Jin who started her Act Two in life as an actress walks in.)

139
00:05:07,164 --> 00:05:08,163
My gosh, hello.

140
00:05:08,164 --> 00:05:10,439
(I'm constantly reminded)

141
00:05:11,164 --> 00:05:13,473
(Summoning "Killer" by Baby V.O.X)

142
00:05:13,474 --> 00:05:15,549
- Baby V.O.X. - That's the song.

143
00:05:15,844 --> 00:05:17,450
My gosh. Hee Jin.

144
00:05:17,544 --> 00:05:18,814
It's so nice to see you.

145
00:05:18,815 --> 00:05:19,973
- Hee Jin. - Hello.

146
00:05:19,974 --> 00:05:21,644
- It's so nice to see you. - This is amazing.

147
00:05:21,645 --> 00:05:23,343
- Hello. - Stand over there.

148
00:05:23,344 --> 00:05:24,644
- It's her first time here. - It's so nice to see you.

149
00:05:24,645 --> 00:05:25,989
I've never seen her in person.

150
00:05:26,214 --> 00:05:28,530
- My gosh, Hee Jin is here. - She was in Baby V.O.X.

151
00:05:28,854 --> 00:05:31,923
All right. This is her first time on Running Man.

152
00:05:31,924 --> 00:05:32,954
- Really? - Yes.

153
00:05:32,955 --> 00:05:34,423
Please say hello to the viewers.

154
00:05:34,424 --> 00:05:36,394
Hello.

155
00:05:36,395 --> 00:05:38,739
I'm Lee Hee Jin.

156
00:05:38,835 --> 00:05:42,939
Hello. I'm Lee Hee Jin.

157
00:05:43,534 --> 00:05:44,564
Her voice.

158
00:05:44,565 --> 00:05:45,774
She feels awkward as it's been a long time.

159
00:05:45,775 --> 00:05:47,533
- Right. I bet. I can understand it. - Right.

160
00:05:47,534 --> 00:05:50,303
I should tell you guys this. Kan Mi Youn got married recently.

161
00:05:50,304 --> 00:05:52,874
- Yes. - Everyone went to her wedding.

162
00:05:52,875 --> 00:05:54,644
I heard you turned down...

163
00:05:54,645 --> 00:05:55,814
- her offer to get the bouquet. - You did?

164
00:05:55,815 --> 00:05:59,514
I wasn't confident that I could get married within six months.

165
00:05:59,515 --> 00:06:01,653
If you don't, you can't get married for three years or something.

166
00:06:01,654 --> 00:06:03,153
- Right. - There's a myth like that.

167
00:06:03,154 --> 00:06:06,429
So you can keep getting the bouquet before your six months are up.

168
00:06:06,525 --> 00:06:07,994
- What? - You can keep getting it.

169
00:06:07,995 --> 00:06:09,824
- Are you renewing the term? - Yes, you are.

170
00:06:09,825 --> 00:06:12,363
- You can renew it? - Don't let that stop you, Hee Jin.

171
00:06:12,364 --> 00:06:13,564
- You can renew it. - Get the bouquet.

172
00:06:13,565 --> 00:06:15,663
- Get another one within six months. - She can get another one.

173
00:06:15,664 --> 00:06:18,533
- You can renew it. - And you can dry the flowers.

174
00:06:18,534 --> 00:06:20,309
And if you burn them, it will be gone.

175
00:06:20,474 --> 00:06:21,774
I'm serious.

176
00:06:21,775 --> 00:06:25,543
(If you burn the dry flowers, the curse will be lifted.)

177
00:06:25,544 --> 00:06:26,944
- I'm serious. - What was that?

178
00:06:26,945 --> 00:06:28,014
- I'm serious. - I didn't know.

179
00:06:28,015 --> 00:06:29,913
- You can do that. - She's spreading...

180
00:06:29,914 --> 00:06:31,014
- a weird spell. - What...

181
00:06:31,015 --> 00:06:32,954
Why would you burn the flowers?

182
00:06:32,955 --> 00:06:36,283
We talked about Mi Youn's wedding briefly.

183
00:06:36,284 --> 00:06:38,254
- There's another guest. - There's one more?

184
00:06:38,255 --> 00:06:40,723
Let's continue with the third guest. Let's bring in the guest.

185
00:06:40,724 --> 00:06:41,923
(It's time to meet the third guest.)

186
00:06:41,924 --> 00:06:43,824
(The guest will enter after Han Na and Hee Jin.)

187
00:06:43,825 --> 00:06:47,439
(Who is this friendly face?)

188
00:06:50,664 --> 00:06:53,280
- It's YooA. - She's in OH MY GIRL.

189
00:06:54,205 --> 00:06:56,173
(OH MY GIRL is beloved for their mystical and innocent themes.)

190
00:06:56,174 --> 00:06:59,173
(And YooA is the lead vocalist in the group.)

191
00:06:59,174 --> 00:07:01,444
(And singing isn't the only thing she excels in.)

192
00:07:01,445 --> 00:07:02,444
(With her groovy moves and intense gaze,)

193
00:07:02,445 --> 00:07:05,084
(she's famous as the main dancer of the group.)

194
00:07:05,085 --> 00:07:06,713
(Unexpected side of this adorable girl)

195
00:07:06,714 --> 00:07:09,400
OH MY GIRL. She's in OH MY GIRL.

196
00:07:09,455 --> 00:07:10,853
Hello.

197
00:07:10,854 --> 00:07:13,629
- She has such a small face. - She's the best.

198
00:07:14,195 --> 00:07:15,423
She's the best dancer.

199
00:07:15,424 --> 00:07:17,723
YooA, is this your first time on our show?

200
00:07:17,724 --> 00:07:19,863
Yes. I'm really nervous right now.

201
00:07:19,864 --> 00:07:21,793
- Really? - I don't know if I'm shaking...

202
00:07:21,794 --> 00:07:23,064
because I'm cold or because I'm nervous.

203
00:07:23,065 --> 00:07:25,204
- She said she's cold, Kwang Soo. - Pardon?

204
00:07:25,205 --> 00:07:26,874
(She said she's cold, Kwang Soo.)

205
00:07:26,875 --> 00:07:28,274
- She's said she's cold. - Right.

206
00:07:28,275 --> 00:07:30,944
He must be colder. He's only wearing this coat.

207
00:07:30,945 --> 00:07:33,514
You used to take off your jackets, but you don't do that nowadays.

208
00:07:33,515 --> 00:07:35,249
I'm coming down with a cold too.

209
00:07:36,145 --> 00:07:37,814
- I'm coming down with a cold. - Seriously.

210
00:07:37,815 --> 00:07:39,689
He said he's coming down with a cold.

211
00:07:41,154 --> 00:07:43,024
- He's firm. - Right.

212
00:07:43,025 --> 00:07:44,283
- But still. - Pardon?

213
00:07:44,284 --> 00:07:45,353
But still.

214
00:07:45,354 --> 00:07:47,129
Will you be happy if I take this off for you?

215
00:07:47,955 --> 00:07:50,463
What are you doing, Kwang Soo? She's cold.

216
00:07:50,464 --> 00:07:51,894
- What are you doing? She's cold. - What?

217
00:07:51,895 --> 00:07:53,570
- She said she's cold. - What are you doing?

218
00:07:53,664 --> 00:07:54,663
I mean...

219
00:07:54,664 --> 00:07:56,264
What about Sun Bin?

220
00:07:56,265 --> 00:07:57,264
(Starting to take off his coat)

221
00:07:57,265 --> 00:07:59,850
- Are you nice to all the women? - Unbelievable.

222
00:08:00,174 --> 00:08:02,004
- When you have a girlfriend? - You guys are jerks.

223
00:08:02,005 --> 00:08:05,020
(You guys are jerks.)

224
00:08:05,575 --> 00:08:07,419
You are so bad.

225
00:08:08,445 --> 00:08:11,590
(These bad guys are laughing.)

226
00:08:11,885 --> 00:08:13,890
Teasing Kwang Soo is so much fun.

227
00:08:14,714 --> 00:08:16,299
- Kwang Soo. - But...

228
00:08:16,455 --> 00:08:17,454
(I'm fine.)

229
00:08:17,455 --> 00:08:18,624
- All right. - It's the best.

230
00:08:18,625 --> 00:08:20,423
Let's bring in the next guest.

231
00:08:20,424 --> 00:08:22,624
- Come on out. - The next guest is a man.

232
00:08:22,625 --> 00:08:24,923
- Really? - My gosh. Ji Hyo.

233
00:08:24,924 --> 00:08:26,363
- So Min. - Both of you look so happy...

234
00:08:26,364 --> 00:08:27,463
- to meet him. - So Min, no pushing back your hair?

235
00:08:27,464 --> 00:08:28,934
She's pushing back her hair again.

236
00:08:28,935 --> 00:08:31,080
(Getting ready to be charming)

237
00:08:31,565 --> 00:08:33,004
Come on out.

238
00:08:33,005 --> 00:08:34,450
(Here's the last guest.)

239
00:08:35,304 --> 00:08:37,144
(The female members of the show are anticipating to meet the guest.)

240
00:08:37,145 --> 00:08:39,144
(Who is the male guest?)

241
00:08:39,145 --> 00:08:40,290
Hello.

242
00:08:40,515 --> 00:08:42,149
- Yoo Byung Jae. - It's Yoo Byung Jae.

243
00:08:42,914 --> 00:08:46,254
(The sure bet on variety shows, Yoo Byung Jae)

244
00:08:46,255 --> 00:08:48,884
(He fearlessly pinched Jong Kook's cheek.)

245
00:08:48,885 --> 00:08:50,724
(I hate getting my cheek pinched the most.)

246
00:08:50,725 --> 00:08:53,729
(He was thoroughly beloved by Jong Kook after that.)

247
00:08:54,324 --> 00:08:57,364
(Hello, I'm here!)

248
00:08:57,365 --> 00:09:00,163
(I see. It was Byung Jae.)

249
00:09:00,164 --> 00:09:01,409
Byung Jae.

250
00:09:01,995 --> 00:09:04,234
- It's been a while. - I haven't seen you for a while.

251
00:09:04,235 --> 00:09:05,433
Hello.

252
00:09:05,434 --> 00:09:06,734
- Hi. - Hello.

253
00:09:06,735 --> 00:09:08,649
- Hey, Byung Jae. - He's hilarious.

254
00:09:08,904 --> 00:09:10,350
He pretended to be cheerful.

255
00:09:11,145 --> 00:09:12,144
He's not cheerful.

256
00:09:12,145 --> 00:09:14,214
He's not that cheerful.

257
00:09:14,215 --> 00:09:17,043
Back then, you were just yourself, but I think you've changed.

258
00:09:17,044 --> 00:09:19,783
Yes. I watched Heo Kyeong Hwan's performance on the show last week.

259
00:09:19,784 --> 00:09:22,524
(Yes. I watched Heo Kyeong Hwan's performance on the show last week.)

260
00:09:22,525 --> 00:09:25,624
(Byung Jae felt the danger of not preparing for a variety show.)

261
00:09:25,625 --> 00:09:27,923
- I wanted to show a new side of me. - That's why.

262
00:09:27,924 --> 00:09:30,693
By the way, you look like a celebrity now.

263
00:09:30,694 --> 00:09:33,063
- What made you say that? - I see NASA written here.

264
00:09:33,064 --> 00:09:34,864
- And you dyed your hair yellow. - Right.

265
00:09:34,865 --> 00:09:36,409
I've had this hair for two years.

266
00:09:36,834 --> 00:09:38,364
Really? I'm sorry.

267
00:09:38,365 --> 00:09:39,933
- Right. - My gosh.

268
00:09:39,934 --> 00:09:42,134
- Everyone here is busy. - That's right.

269
00:09:42,135 --> 00:09:43,504
- That happens, you know. - My gosh.

270
00:09:43,505 --> 00:09:45,244
Shouldn't Byung Jae and YooA stand together?

271
00:09:45,245 --> 00:09:46,974
Right, they should. Kwang Soo, switch your spot with him.

272
00:09:46,975 --> 00:09:48,344
- You should switch spots. - Me and him?

273
00:09:48,345 --> 00:09:49,614
Right.

274
00:09:49,615 --> 00:09:50,989
- Look at the size of their faces. - My gosh.

275
00:09:51,584 --> 00:09:55,083
(A difference between a man who became a celebrity and a natural?)

276
00:09:55,084 --> 00:09:56,484
Come over here.

277
00:09:56,485 --> 00:09:58,254
- He told Byung Jae to move. - That's fascinating.

278
00:09:58,255 --> 00:09:59,254
It's fascinating, right?

279
00:09:59,255 --> 00:10:00,754
On "Star King", they did this CG.

280
00:10:00,755 --> 00:10:02,153
- Enlarging the face? - But...

281
00:10:02,154 --> 00:10:04,024
Seriously. YooA's face...

282
00:10:04,025 --> 00:10:05,663
- is too small. - She has such a small face.

283
00:10:05,664 --> 00:10:06,933
- It's too small. - It's this big.

284
00:10:06,934 --> 00:10:08,570
Her face could disappear.

285
00:10:08,664 --> 00:10:11,080
Let's talk about what they have been up to these days.

286
00:10:11,164 --> 00:10:13,073
- By the way, Han Na was... - Yes.

287
00:10:13,074 --> 00:10:14,710
on our show three weeks ago.

288
00:10:14,735 --> 00:10:16,979
We don't have any updates.

289
00:10:18,145 --> 00:10:19,714
(Nothing new happened yet.)

290
00:10:19,715 --> 00:10:23,744
Moving on, we'll talk about Hee Jin's recent life.

291
00:10:23,745 --> 00:10:25,043
Do you have a boyfriend?

292
00:10:25,044 --> 00:10:26,183
- No. - I see.

293
00:10:26,184 --> 00:10:27,754
Actually,

294
00:10:27,755 --> 00:10:30,053
when you were on variety shows before, people asked this a lot.

295
00:10:30,054 --> 00:10:32,224
If you had an ideal type for men...

296
00:10:32,225 --> 00:10:33,953
- Right. - or who your ideal type was.

297
00:10:33,954 --> 00:10:36,423
When you talked about your ideal types, how did you answer it?

298
00:10:36,424 --> 00:10:38,994
- I only mentioned one person. - Who?

299
00:10:38,995 --> 00:10:40,293
- Who was it? - Go Soo.

300
00:10:40,294 --> 00:10:41,994
(It's Go Soo.)

301
00:10:41,995 --> 00:10:43,403
David Go.

302
00:10:43,404 --> 00:10:45,004
- He's really handsome. - Go Soo.

303
00:10:45,005 --> 00:10:46,703
I guess you cared about men's looks when you were young.

304
00:10:46,704 --> 00:10:47,903
(I did.)

305
00:10:47,904 --> 00:10:48,933
You cared about that.

306
00:10:48,934 --> 00:10:50,274
Even men can agree to that.

307
00:10:50,275 --> 00:10:52,374
- He was everyone's ideal type. - I agree.

308
00:10:52,375 --> 00:10:53,943
Do you have another ideal type?

309
00:10:53,944 --> 00:10:55,389
If you don't have one, you can say so.

310
00:10:55,444 --> 00:10:57,813
- I have an ideal type. - You do?

311
00:10:57,814 --> 00:10:59,714
Can you tell us?

312
00:10:59,715 --> 00:11:01,754
(Who is her current ideal type of men?)

313
00:11:01,755 --> 00:11:04,183
(Go Soo with chiseled facial features was her idea type.)

314
00:11:04,184 --> 00:11:07,269
(She cared about looks before. What is her ideal type now?)

315
00:11:08,255 --> 00:11:09,624
Someone who won't cheat.

316
00:11:09,625 --> 00:11:11,139
(Someone who won't cheat.)

317
00:11:13,395 --> 00:11:16,533
- Someone who won't cheat. - Right. That's so true.

318
00:11:16,534 --> 00:11:18,004
She was burned before.

319
00:11:18,005 --> 00:11:19,203
- Now... - She got cheated on.

320
00:11:19,204 --> 00:11:21,734
- Now, her ideal type is detailed. - She was.

321
00:11:21,735 --> 00:11:23,443
- It's not about looks. - It's detailed now.

322
00:11:23,444 --> 00:11:24,573
It's not about looks now.

323
00:11:24,574 --> 00:11:26,043
- She doesn't care about looks. - Exactly.

324
00:11:26,044 --> 00:11:28,489
- I can tell she was hurt before. - Right. She was hurt.

325
00:11:28,615 --> 00:11:30,460
She was hurt before.

326
00:11:30,615 --> 00:11:33,313
- "Cheat". - That's the first one. No cheating.

327
00:11:33,314 --> 00:11:35,823
- Someone who's hardworking. - A hardworking man.

328
00:11:35,824 --> 00:11:38,624
Also, I don't want him...

329
00:11:38,625 --> 00:11:41,423
to intrude or bother me when I'm working.

330
00:11:41,424 --> 00:11:43,070
All right.

331
00:11:43,694 --> 00:11:46,063
- I don't know who her ex is. - Who is he?

332
00:11:46,064 --> 00:11:47,594
- He bothered her. - Who is that?

333
00:11:47,595 --> 00:11:49,403
- And he cheated on her. - This is hard.

334
00:11:49,404 --> 00:11:51,340
- That was terrible. - That was his ex.

335
00:11:51,605 --> 00:11:53,009
Should we curse him out for you?

336
00:11:53,074 --> 00:11:54,173
Yes.

337
00:11:54,174 --> 00:11:56,673
You scumbag!

338
00:11:56,674 --> 00:11:58,180
(You scumbag!)

339
00:11:59,414 --> 00:12:00,720
You scumbag!

340
00:12:01,414 --> 00:12:02,859
Don't cheat on women, you jerk!

341
00:12:03,485 --> 00:12:04,790
You piece of trash.

342
00:12:05,715 --> 00:12:07,790
(That hits the spot.)

343
00:12:08,954 --> 00:12:10,830
- I got into the role. - Was that enough?

344
00:12:11,525 --> 00:12:13,494
(As he watches her, he's reminded of...)

345
00:12:13,495 --> 00:12:14,800
He doesn't cheat.

346
00:12:15,755 --> 00:12:16,994
He doesn't cheat.

347
00:12:16,995 --> 00:12:18,624
(Pointing at Se Chan)

348
00:12:18,625 --> 00:12:19,970
You won't bother me.

349
00:12:20,595 --> 00:12:21,869
You work hard at your job.

350
00:12:22,294 --> 00:12:25,464
- Yang Se Chan! - Yang Se Chan!

351
00:12:25,465 --> 00:12:30,180
(The perfect ideal type for realistic women, Yang Se Chan)

352
00:12:30,975 --> 00:12:33,144
- Hey, it might work out for them. - This is crazy.

353
00:12:33,145 --> 00:12:34,989
Hey, I think you really might start dating.

354
00:12:35,015 --> 00:12:37,859
- What's going on between you two? - Stop it. Stop pushing us.

355
00:12:37,914 --> 00:12:39,859
Don't toy with So Min.

356
00:12:40,615 --> 00:12:42,583
(Is this strictly for business? Or do they actually have feelings?)

357
00:12:42,584 --> 00:12:44,259
How could you go along this act?

358
00:12:44,684 --> 00:12:46,423
- I'm tearing up. - That's the worst.

359
00:12:46,424 --> 00:12:48,524
Jae Seok, she should dance about her breakup.

360
00:12:48,525 --> 00:12:50,464
- Should she? Hee Jin. - Yes.

361
00:12:50,465 --> 00:12:52,764
Han Na did this breakup dance three weeks ago on our show.

362
00:12:52,765 --> 00:12:54,333
- She really sent it. - Yes.

363
00:12:54,334 --> 00:12:56,279
This is the dance you do when you went through a breakup.

364
00:12:56,304 --> 00:12:57,433
Demonstrate for her, Han Na.

365
00:12:57,434 --> 00:12:58,864
This is Gook Jin's dance.

366
00:12:58,865 --> 00:13:01,210
She was covering one eye because tears were falling.

367
00:13:01,235 --> 00:13:04,080
- But you show the other side. - Show the other side.

368
00:13:04,245 --> 00:13:06,019
You need to show the pretty side.

369
00:13:06,044 --> 00:13:07,889
- Show your pretty face. - My good side is the left side.

370
00:13:08,115 --> 00:13:09,384
In 1, 2.

371
00:13:09,385 --> 00:13:10,519
(Suddenly dancing)

372
00:13:11,015 --> 00:13:14,489
(Starting her breakup dance)

373
00:13:14,855 --> 00:13:16,754
(Gook Ju's club dance was reinterpreted traditionally.)

374
00:13:16,755 --> 00:13:19,529
- Han Na. - Good job. Nice.

375
00:13:19,755 --> 00:13:22,153
(Dancing stiffly)

376
00:13:22,154 --> 00:13:23,739
Hee Jin can pull it off too.

377
00:13:23,765 --> 00:13:24,864
- She can pull it off. - Nice.

378
00:13:24,865 --> 00:13:26,769
- That's how you dance. - She pulled it off.

379
00:13:26,794 --> 00:13:28,693
- The breakup dance was nice. - Well done.

380
00:13:28,694 --> 00:13:29,764
- Breakup dance. - Breakup dance.

381
00:13:29,765 --> 00:13:31,004
All right.

382
00:13:31,005 --> 00:13:33,474
- I always say this. - This is funny.

383
00:13:33,475 --> 00:13:35,104
I hope you can meet great guys.

384
00:13:35,105 --> 00:13:36,749
- Half of our world are men. - Right.

385
00:13:37,475 --> 00:13:39,443
- That's right! - That's right!

386
00:13:39,444 --> 00:13:41,274
- That's right! I can do it. - You can do it.

387
00:13:41,275 --> 00:13:43,813
- Let's do this. - Let's do this.

388
00:13:43,814 --> 00:13:45,313
- Yang Se Chan! - Yang Se Chan!

389
00:13:45,314 --> 00:13:46,889
(The man of her new love)

390
00:13:47,115 --> 00:13:49,254
(Showing his teeth)

391
00:13:49,255 --> 00:13:50,423
He won't cheat.

392
00:13:50,424 --> 00:13:51,683
- He works hard. - He works hard.

393
00:13:51,684 --> 00:13:52,869
And he doesn't bother you.

394
00:13:53,355 --> 00:13:54,923
- Yang Se Chan! - Yang Se Chan!

395
00:13:54,924 --> 00:13:57,970
(The ideal type for women who had been hurt, Yang Se Chan)

396
00:13:59,395 --> 00:14:00,533
Don't get the wrong idea.

397
00:14:00,534 --> 00:14:02,533
Se Chan is the only single guy on our show.

398
00:14:02,534 --> 00:14:03,663
- I see. - Great.

399
00:14:03,664 --> 00:14:04,964
- What about me? - Hey, Jong Kook.

400
00:14:04,965 --> 00:14:07,004
- I'm single too. - Is he an old man?

401
00:14:07,005 --> 00:14:09,573
(I've been single for 44 years.)

402
00:14:09,574 --> 00:14:11,149
- Do you want to be invisible? - You...

403
00:14:11,275 --> 00:14:12,580
Hey, make her invisible too.

404
00:14:12,875 --> 00:14:14,043
That was something else.

405
00:14:14,044 --> 00:14:15,920
- Don't try to put me on his list. - Hey.

406
00:14:16,414 --> 00:14:17,514
I can't see you.

407
00:14:17,515 --> 00:14:18,744
Are you doing that on your own?

408
00:14:18,745 --> 00:14:21,290
Let's interview YooA next.

409
00:14:21,985 --> 00:14:24,183
- Did you know this? - What?

410
00:14:24,184 --> 00:14:25,624
She's the main dancer of OH MY GIRL.

411
00:14:25,625 --> 00:14:26,994
- I know that. - Really?

412
00:14:26,995 --> 00:14:28,153
- You didn't know, did you? - She's the main dancer.

413
00:14:28,154 --> 00:14:29,563
- Really? - Isn't your brother a good dancer?

414
00:14:29,564 --> 00:14:31,224
- Really? - Yes, he's a choreographer.

415
00:14:31,225 --> 00:14:32,663
- My gosh. - Really?

416
00:14:32,664 --> 00:14:34,063
YooA.

417
00:14:34,064 --> 00:14:35,409
Can you dance for us?

418
00:14:36,204 --> 00:14:37,464
- Sure. - Really?

419
00:14:37,465 --> 00:14:39,274
- Yes. - Please demonstrate.

420
00:14:39,275 --> 00:14:42,004
- She's really good. She's good. - My goodness.

421
00:14:42,005 --> 00:14:43,543
- I can't wait. - She's very good.

422
00:14:43,544 --> 00:14:45,149
I didn't know she was the main dancer.

423
00:14:45,245 --> 00:14:48,989
(The queen of dancers among idol singers will dance soon.)

424
00:14:51,715 --> 00:14:54,484
(Powerful and energetic)

425
00:14:54,485 --> 00:14:55,659
She's so cool.

426
00:14:56,355 --> 00:14:57,529
She's so cool.

427
00:14:58,225 --> 00:14:59,430
This is really cool.

428
00:15:00,895 --> 00:15:02,024
Look at her gaze.

429
00:15:02,025 --> 00:15:03,139
(Taking big strides)

430
00:15:05,365 --> 00:15:07,810
(Surprised)

431
00:15:08,934 --> 00:15:11,903
(Wrapping up with an edgy dance move)

432
00:15:11,904 --> 00:15:13,874
- There's more. - There's more?

433
00:15:13,875 --> 00:15:16,004
(It's not over yet.)

434
00:15:16,005 --> 00:15:17,644
(Wait, this song is...)

435
00:15:17,645 --> 00:15:19,050
- Isn't that Michael Jackson's? - It's Michael Jackson's.

436
00:15:19,275 --> 00:15:21,214
("Smooth Criminal" by Michael Jackson)

437
00:15:21,215 --> 00:15:22,420
I love Michael Jackson.

438
00:15:28,515 --> 00:15:29,783
My gosh, Michael Jackson's song.

439
00:15:29,784 --> 00:15:31,729
(She recreates the genius dancer, Michael Jackson's performance.)

440
00:15:32,385 --> 00:15:33,869
That was so cool.

441
00:15:43,934 --> 00:15:45,440
(Perfect technique)

442
00:15:52,544 --> 00:15:55,043
(Summoning back Michael Jackson to 2019)

443
00:15:55,044 --> 00:15:57,320
(Utterly excited)

444
00:15:57,745 --> 00:16:00,053
(Her legendary performance was good enough to be compared to...)

445
00:16:00,054 --> 00:16:01,813
(the king of pop songs, Michael Jackson's performance.)

446
00:16:01,814 --> 00:16:05,100
(She's indeed the queen of dancers among idol singers.)

447
00:16:05,424 --> 00:16:06,670
Hold on.

448
00:16:06,995 --> 00:16:08,823
- You know what? - You're a great dancer.

449
00:16:08,824 --> 00:16:11,063
I got goosebumps when I was watching this touching performance.

450
00:16:11,064 --> 00:16:12,124
- Why? - I saw it too.

451
00:16:12,125 --> 00:16:13,264
- Did you see it? - Yes.

452
00:16:13,265 --> 00:16:14,970
When we were cheering like crazy, Seok Jin went,

453
00:16:15,034 --> 00:16:16,504
"Hey, what's your name again?"

454
00:16:16,505 --> 00:16:18,264
(Hey, what's your name again?)

455
00:16:18,265 --> 00:16:19,680
- I heard that too. - My gosh.

456
00:16:19,904 --> 00:16:21,474
(It was after when she was done.)

457
00:16:21,475 --> 00:16:22,680
Hey, what's your name again?

458
00:16:22,704 --> 00:16:24,350
- It's YooA. - YooA?

459
00:16:24,804 --> 00:16:27,290
(I need to remember her.)

460
00:16:27,544 --> 00:16:28,950
I wanted to know her name.

461
00:16:29,174 --> 00:16:31,190
- I wanted to remember her name. - YooA.

462
00:16:31,345 --> 00:16:32,783
And she was really nice about it.

463
00:16:32,784 --> 00:16:34,153
"It's YooA."

464
00:16:34,154 --> 00:16:36,129
- YooA. - I'm a huge fan now.

465
00:16:36,784 --> 00:16:39,283
- She's the best. I told you. - So...

466
00:16:39,284 --> 00:16:41,894
- YooA... - Yes.

467
00:16:41,895 --> 00:16:44,394
When she heard that Hee Jin would be on the show with her,

468
00:16:44,395 --> 00:16:45,594
- Baby V.O.X's song? - Really?

469
00:16:45,595 --> 00:16:48,364
- she prepared a performance. - Really?

470
00:16:48,365 --> 00:16:50,663
- I love the song. - Will you join her?

471
00:16:50,664 --> 00:16:52,509
- It's been so long. - Awesome.

472
00:16:52,564 --> 00:16:55,533
- I want to see it. - YooA prepared this performance.

473
00:16:55,534 --> 00:16:57,303
- Let's check it out. - It's this.

474
00:16:57,304 --> 00:16:58,374
- Play the song. - This...

475
00:16:58,375 --> 00:16:59,543
YooA will be performing?

476
00:16:59,544 --> 00:17:01,019
(Anticipating)

477
00:17:01,574 --> 00:17:02,813
("Ya Ya Ya" by Baby V.O.X)

478
00:17:02,814 --> 00:17:04,060
It's "Ya Ya Ya".

479
00:17:05,184 --> 00:17:06,514
It's "Ya Ya Ya".

480
00:17:06,515 --> 00:17:07,960
(She's happy to hear her song.)

481
00:17:09,054 --> 00:17:11,859
(Looking cheerful and bubbly)

482
00:17:12,554 --> 00:17:14,454
- I really love this song. - This was the song.

483
00:17:14,455 --> 00:17:16,100
(Trying to remember the choreography)

484
00:17:16,294 --> 00:17:18,500
(The original singer dances.)

485
00:17:19,265 --> 00:17:22,209
(She swings her arm just like the old days.)

486
00:17:23,534 --> 00:17:25,264
She's the original singer.

487
00:17:25,265 --> 00:17:26,850
- You remember it. - She's the original singer.

488
00:17:27,675 --> 00:17:28,734
(It was a beloved song back then.)

489
00:17:28,735 --> 00:17:30,143
She's moving forward.

490
00:17:30,144 --> 00:17:31,580
- She's moving forward. - She's moving forward.

491
00:17:31,844 --> 00:17:32,873
(Bringing back the 90s)

492
00:17:32,874 --> 00:17:33,990
This is it!

493
00:17:37,114 --> 00:17:38,184
That was hard.

494
00:17:38,185 --> 00:17:39,553
(Their performance brought them back to the 90s.)

495
00:17:39,554 --> 00:17:41,330
She's really good.

496
00:17:42,455 --> 00:17:45,083
(With the nostalgic performances, her interview ends.)

497
00:17:45,084 --> 00:17:46,553
It's been a while.

498
00:17:46,554 --> 00:17:47,793
All right.

499
00:17:47,794 --> 00:17:49,323
- Byung Jae. - Yes.

500
00:17:49,324 --> 00:17:50,964
I heard that you feel especially intimidated...

501
00:17:50,965 --> 00:17:54,194
when you meet Jong Kook.

502
00:17:54,195 --> 00:17:55,563
Why aren't you standing next to me today?

503
00:17:55,564 --> 00:17:56,734
If he did,

504
00:17:56,735 --> 00:17:58,434
- he'd be in Jong Kook's arms. - Right.

505
00:17:58,435 --> 00:18:00,980
- Jong Kook likes guys like him. - Right.

506
00:18:01,104 --> 00:18:03,504
- I like Byung Jae or Shorry. - Shorry.

507
00:18:03,505 --> 00:18:05,204
- Shorry. - People who fit in his arms.

508
00:18:05,205 --> 00:18:08,073
- Back then, I liked guys like Haha. - Right. Exactly.

509
00:18:08,074 --> 00:18:09,274
(Invisible wall)

510
00:18:09,275 --> 00:18:11,083
- But you don't like him now? - I don't like him now.

511
00:18:11,084 --> 00:18:13,159
(Jong Kook, I'm still here!)

512
00:18:13,784 --> 00:18:15,359
I used to hang out with him.

513
00:18:15,814 --> 00:18:16,954
By the way,

514
00:18:16,955 --> 00:18:19,330
- He never looked at me today. - we...

515
00:18:19,794 --> 00:18:21,424
(I keep seeing something.)

516
00:18:21,425 --> 00:18:23,194
- Yes, that's right. - Did you watch that?

517
00:18:23,195 --> 00:18:26,123
Actually, I have never met Jong Kook...

518
00:18:26,124 --> 00:18:27,734
- in private. - We have never hung out.

519
00:18:27,735 --> 00:18:30,464
And the only time we talked was...

520
00:18:30,465 --> 00:18:31,764
I was talking to DinDin...

521
00:18:31,765 --> 00:18:33,449
- on the phone at night. - Go on.

522
00:18:33,574 --> 00:18:34,774
Jong Kook said...

523
00:18:34,775 --> 00:18:37,143
that DinDin had to hang up because he had to play soccer.

524
00:18:37,144 --> 00:18:39,850
(DinDin has to play soccer now. Hang up the phone now.)

525
00:18:40,114 --> 00:18:41,873
- Soccer. - It was Thursday, right?

526
00:18:41,874 --> 00:18:43,684
- Futsal? - He was talking to Byung Jae...

527
00:18:43,685 --> 00:18:44,714
during our break.

528
00:18:44,715 --> 00:18:46,113
I asked who it was, and he said Byung Jae.

529
00:18:46,114 --> 00:18:47,553
Then I yelled, "Hang up!"

530
00:18:47,554 --> 00:18:49,053
- You heard that. - But it didn't sound like...

531
00:18:49,054 --> 00:18:50,929
DinDin wanted to play soccer.

532
00:18:51,225 --> 00:18:52,760
(Is that so?)

533
00:18:53,025 --> 00:18:54,323
Are you coming this week?

534
00:18:54,324 --> 00:18:55,770
Yes, I'll be there tomorrow.

535
00:18:55,794 --> 00:18:56,964
Yes, I ought to go!

536
00:18:56,965 --> 00:18:59,293
(I'll be there no matter what.)

537
00:18:59,294 --> 00:19:01,333
- You've been absent a lot. - I've come to my senses.

538
00:19:01,334 --> 00:19:02,464
Without Jong Kook,

539
00:19:02,465 --> 00:19:04,179
more than 90 percent of the teammates would leave.

540
00:19:04,304 --> 00:19:05,704
It's unbelievable.

541
00:19:05,705 --> 00:19:07,504
If Jong Kook says that he's not showing up...

542
00:19:07,505 --> 00:19:08,904
in the group chat,

543
00:19:08,905 --> 00:19:11,004
everyone else bails out as well.

544
00:19:11,005 --> 00:19:13,189
If Jong Kook says he's coming,

545
00:19:13,215 --> 00:19:14,974
everyone else says that they are too.

546
00:19:14,975 --> 00:19:16,184
He's like a bell.

547
00:19:16,185 --> 00:19:17,214
That's amazing.

548
00:19:17,215 --> 00:19:18,643
- He's the center of the club. - I know.

549
00:19:18,644 --> 00:19:20,514
If I don't go, they yield the field to another team.

550
00:19:20,515 --> 00:19:22,654
- Right. - If he goes, we all go.

551
00:19:22,655 --> 00:19:24,083
(Everyone shows up if he does.)

552
00:19:24,084 --> 00:19:25,154
They follow him.

553
00:19:25,155 --> 00:19:26,899
It's been a while,

554
00:19:27,094 --> 00:19:28,494
but how about we do an acrostic poem?

555
00:19:28,495 --> 00:19:29,740
That sounds good.

556
00:19:30,094 --> 00:19:31,593
- He's good at them. - Right.

557
00:19:31,594 --> 00:19:33,033
He's amazing.

558
00:19:33,034 --> 00:19:34,293
What should we do?

559
00:19:34,294 --> 00:19:35,533
I'm fine with anything.

560
00:19:35,534 --> 00:19:37,333
- How about Jee Seok Jin? - Sure.

561
00:19:37,334 --> 00:19:38,633
- All right. - I tend...

562
00:19:38,634 --> 00:19:40,004
- to be quick. - All right.

563
00:19:40,005 --> 00:19:41,274
- We need to hurry. - All right.

564
00:19:41,275 --> 00:19:42,974
Let's hurry and do one with his name.

565
00:19:42,975 --> 00:19:44,219
- Jee. - Last week,

566
00:19:44,245 --> 00:19:46,914
- Seok. - I saw his social network.

567
00:19:46,915 --> 00:19:48,490
And he looked like a bachelor.

568
00:19:50,715 --> 00:19:52,020
He watched him on TV.

569
00:19:52,084 --> 00:19:54,053
Let's do Se Chan now.

570
00:19:54,054 --> 00:19:55,053
I'm sure it'll be difficult.

571
00:19:55,054 --> 00:19:56,699
- Yang. - Se Hyeong's brother,

572
00:19:56,884 --> 00:19:58,984
- Se. - Se Chan is...

573
00:19:58,985 --> 00:20:00,300
- Chan. - the fifth wheel on this show.

574
00:20:01,725 --> 00:20:03,424
(It's hurtful, but it's true.)

575
00:20:03,425 --> 00:20:04,893
- He's good. - He really is.

576
00:20:04,894 --> 00:20:06,540
- That didn't take long. - It's because...

577
00:20:06,735 --> 00:20:08,934
all the other members intimidate you.

578
00:20:08,935 --> 00:20:12,010
And Yeong Ja intimidates me "Omniscient Interfering View".

579
00:20:12,235 --> 00:20:14,004
We're both like that.

580
00:20:14,005 --> 00:20:15,850
That's how we work.

581
00:20:16,275 --> 00:20:17,974
When working with seniors, it feels the worst...

582
00:20:17,975 --> 00:20:19,949
- to walk on eggshells. - Right.

583
00:20:20,415 --> 00:20:21,914
For example, if you fail to play along with them...

584
00:20:21,915 --> 00:20:23,260
Right.

585
00:20:23,485 --> 00:20:25,414
- You were like that just now. - Really?

586
00:20:25,415 --> 00:20:28,290
(You were like that too.)

587
00:20:28,985 --> 00:20:30,684
I can't believe you told him that.

588
00:20:30,685 --> 00:20:32,260
You'll only dispirit him.

589
00:20:32,354 --> 00:20:34,323
- He's... - It's better that he did.

590
00:20:34,324 --> 00:20:35,623
- It's better... - I was unsure.

591
00:20:35,624 --> 00:20:38,139
- It's better to tell him. - It's better.

592
00:20:38,195 --> 00:20:40,793
- We're close enough. - Right.

593
00:20:40,794 --> 00:20:42,240
(Byung Jae looks dispirited.)

594
00:20:42,435 --> 00:20:43,633
- All right. - He's good.

595
00:20:43,634 --> 00:20:44,840
That's it.

596
00:20:45,534 --> 00:20:46,833
I've prepared acrostic poems for all of them.

597
00:20:46,834 --> 00:20:48,573
It's over. You can do it again later.

598
00:20:48,574 --> 00:20:50,904
Make one with my name when we're on the bus.

599
00:20:50,905 --> 00:20:52,373
- Do it on the bus? - Yes.

600
00:20:52,374 --> 00:20:53,813
- Do we not have one today? - We're shooting here.

601
00:20:53,814 --> 00:20:54,889
We're not getting on a bus?

602
00:20:55,644 --> 00:20:57,260
Don't be ridiculous.

603
00:20:57,945 --> 00:20:59,283
Let him take the bus by himself.

604
00:20:59,284 --> 00:21:02,929
(He can ride it alone.)

605
00:21:03,584 --> 00:21:04,754
(Jong Kook still has a grudge.)

606
00:21:04,755 --> 00:21:06,524
- That's enough. - That's enough.

607
00:21:06,525 --> 00:21:07,954
That's enough.

608
00:21:07,955 --> 00:21:10,123
- You're killing him. - Do I need to cry?

609
00:21:10,124 --> 00:21:12,570
He wanted to ride one, so I just told him to.

610
00:21:12,665 --> 00:21:14,533
I'm so glad it's not me.

611
00:21:14,534 --> 00:21:16,063
He has a grudge.

612
00:21:16,064 --> 00:21:17,209
(Poor Haha.)

613
00:21:17,935 --> 00:21:20,504
For today's race, you can win if you invest well.

614
00:21:20,505 --> 00:21:23,080
It's called Run to You: Project to Attract Investments Race.

615
00:21:24,705 --> 00:21:25,803
Including the four guests,

616
00:21:25,804 --> 00:21:27,714
it'll be an individual match among the 12 of you.

617
00:21:27,715 --> 00:21:30,514
You each have 10 coins each.

618
00:21:30,515 --> 00:21:32,414
The individual with the most amount of R coins wins.

619
00:21:32,415 --> 00:21:33,929
They will receive a reward.

620
00:21:34,084 --> 00:21:35,714
The individual with the fewest coins...

621
00:21:35,715 --> 00:21:38,123
will receive the water cannon as their penalty.

622
00:21:38,124 --> 00:21:40,123
- It's freezing today. - You'd be dead.

623
00:21:40,124 --> 00:21:41,194
You'd freeze.

624
00:21:41,195 --> 00:21:43,464
(It's a very cold day.)

625
00:21:43,465 --> 00:21:45,393
Four individuals may participate per event.

626
00:21:45,394 --> 00:21:46,664
There will be a total of three rounds.

627
00:21:46,665 --> 00:21:48,434
The rest of you...

628
00:21:48,435 --> 00:21:50,204
may invest as many coins as you wish in one member.

629
00:21:50,205 --> 00:21:51,833
If the member you invested in wins,

630
00:21:51,834 --> 00:21:54,774
you'll receive the amount that was invested.

631
00:21:54,775 --> 00:21:57,020
The rest will lose their coins.

632
00:21:57,644 --> 00:21:59,174
Let's get changed and go inside.

633
00:21:59,175 --> 00:22:00,514
- Okay. - Okay!

634
00:22:00,515 --> 00:22:03,159
(They need to be smart about their investments.)

635
00:22:04,584 --> 00:22:06,414
We'll begin the first round.

636
00:22:06,415 --> 00:22:07,530
Okay.

637
00:22:07,884 --> 00:22:09,189
- It's comfortable. - Do you have a cloth?

638
00:22:10,455 --> 00:22:11,454
It's here.

639
00:22:11,455 --> 00:22:12,524
(The staff has it.)

640
00:22:12,525 --> 00:22:13,593
(Staring)

641
00:22:13,594 --> 00:22:14,699
Thank you.

642
00:22:14,955 --> 00:22:16,399
They all want to give it to him.

643
00:22:17,564 --> 00:22:18,563
What is it?

644
00:22:18,564 --> 00:22:19,694
Why are you jealous again?

645
00:22:19,695 --> 00:22:21,434
- What is it? - My gosh.

646
00:22:21,435 --> 00:22:23,810
- My gosh. - You don't even have lenses.

647
00:22:24,165 --> 00:22:25,803
You should be nice to them all the time.

648
00:22:25,804 --> 00:22:27,133
(Ever since Yu San Seul debuted, Seok Jin has been jealous.)

649
00:22:27,134 --> 00:22:28,250
He's so jealous.

650
00:22:28,435 --> 00:22:30,373
Byung Jae looks like...

651
00:22:30,374 --> 00:22:34,290
- a robot vacuum charging. - Right?

652
00:22:35,175 --> 00:22:37,014
He looks like that.

653
00:22:37,015 --> 00:22:38,320
Aren't you uncomfortable?

654
00:22:38,384 --> 00:22:40,030
I'm not that comfortable.

655
00:22:40,185 --> 00:22:41,583
"I'm not that comfortable."

656
00:22:41,584 --> 00:22:45,600
On our way in here, I asked if he liked soccer.

657
00:22:45,685 --> 00:22:47,270
He said he hated it.

658
00:22:48,225 --> 00:22:50,240
(He defended himself.)

659
00:22:50,294 --> 00:22:51,563
- I see. - He didn't give you a chance.

660
00:22:51,564 --> 00:22:53,464
- No, he didn't. - Well done.

661
00:22:53,465 --> 00:22:54,893
- I really don't like it. - Good job.

662
00:22:54,894 --> 00:22:56,464
Then Jong Kook won't ask you anymore.

663
00:22:56,465 --> 00:22:57,563
- No. - No, he won't.

664
00:22:57,564 --> 00:22:58,563
- I won't force him. - Right.

665
00:22:58,564 --> 00:23:00,274
Let me explain once again.

666
00:23:00,275 --> 00:23:03,343
We surveyed 100 individuals.

667
00:23:03,344 --> 00:23:05,143
For example, if we asked them which one of you...

668
00:23:05,144 --> 00:23:07,550
would jump rope the best, they'd rank you guys.

669
00:23:07,574 --> 00:23:09,444
The first place will be compensated twofold,

670
00:23:09,445 --> 00:23:10,813
The fourth place will be threefold.

671
00:23:10,814 --> 00:23:12,014
- Okay. - So on, so forth.

672
00:23:12,015 --> 00:23:14,454
The last place will be compensated tenfold.

673
00:23:14,455 --> 00:23:16,853
You all have 10 coins each.

674
00:23:16,854 --> 00:23:18,553
Let us begin.

675
00:23:18,554 --> 00:23:19,583
- All right. - What is it?

676
00:23:19,584 --> 00:23:21,524
Let me reveal the members...

677
00:23:21,525 --> 00:23:23,494
who will participate in this match.

678
00:23:23,495 --> 00:23:25,063
- What? Jong Kook came in first. - What?

679
00:23:25,064 --> 00:23:26,164
- What? - Kwang Soo...

680
00:23:26,165 --> 00:23:27,234
- and Haha are there too. - Kwang Soo...

681
00:23:27,235 --> 00:23:28,764
- is fivefold. - He's fivefold.

682
00:23:28,765 --> 00:23:30,164
This definitely has something to do with strength.

683
00:23:30,165 --> 00:23:32,904
- Why am I tenfold? - Kwang Soo is strong too.

684
00:23:32,905 --> 00:23:34,033
Why am I tenfold?

685
00:23:34,034 --> 00:23:35,303
(These 4 will participate.)

686
00:23:35,304 --> 00:23:36,543
Haha is the last.

687
00:23:36,544 --> 00:23:38,174
Does this have to do with something scary?

688
00:23:38,175 --> 00:23:41,573
Maybe it's about trivia.

689
00:23:41,574 --> 00:23:42,914
Trivia?

690
00:23:42,915 --> 00:23:44,914
- Trivia? - It doesn't make sense for him.

691
00:23:44,915 --> 00:23:46,914
- What do you mean? - Don't you think so?

692
00:23:46,915 --> 00:23:48,853
- I'm good with trivia. - Really?

693
00:23:48,854 --> 00:23:50,283
I think it's trivia-related.

694
00:23:50,284 --> 00:23:52,459
Ji Hyo and Se Chan both came in fourth place.

695
00:23:52,525 --> 00:23:54,199
- We were in 4th place? - 4th?

696
00:23:54,354 --> 00:23:56,664
- I don't think this is... - It's not about trivia.

697
00:23:56,665 --> 00:23:58,040
- about trivia. - It's not.

698
00:23:58,094 --> 00:23:59,833
I'll bet all my money on that.

699
00:23:59,834 --> 00:24:02,063
- I'm sure that's not it. - If they're in fourth place...

700
00:24:02,064 --> 00:24:03,879
It's definitely not about trivia.

701
00:24:03,935 --> 00:24:05,063
I was wrong.

702
00:24:05,064 --> 00:24:06,434
- You're right. - Right.

703
00:24:06,435 --> 00:24:08,303
First place was Jong Kook.

704
00:24:08,304 --> 00:24:09,873
Second place was Jae Seok.

705
00:24:09,874 --> 00:24:11,649
- What? - Third place was Byung Jae.

706
00:24:12,245 --> 00:24:13,313
Sixth place was Kwang Soo.

707
00:24:13,314 --> 00:24:16,373
Haha came in eighth place alongside the others.

708
00:24:16,374 --> 00:24:17,813
The others as in?

709
00:24:17,814 --> 00:24:19,543
Hee Jin, Han Na, YooA,

710
00:24:19,544 --> 00:24:21,613
- and Seok Jin. - We all came in eighth place?

711
00:24:21,614 --> 00:24:22,783
(He's upset.)

712
00:24:22,784 --> 00:24:24,600
- Long jumping. - Amount of muscles?

713
00:24:24,784 --> 00:24:25,954
- I think I know. - What is it?

714
00:24:25,955 --> 00:24:27,793
It's... How should I put it?

715
00:24:27,794 --> 00:24:30,540
Maybe it's about masculine strength?

716
00:24:30,995 --> 00:24:32,570
(He's happy to have come 1st place.)

717
00:24:33,935 --> 00:24:36,704
But seeing how I came in second place...

718
00:24:36,705 --> 00:24:38,740
(I think he's right.)

719
00:24:38,765 --> 00:24:39,904
Thigh wrestling?

720
00:24:39,905 --> 00:24:41,373
- Something about masculinity? - Masculine strength.

721
00:24:41,374 --> 00:24:42,504
Hey.

722
00:24:42,505 --> 00:24:44,603
I have three kids.

723
00:24:44,604 --> 00:24:46,020
Stamina.

724
00:24:46,475 --> 00:24:48,813
- My stamina is... - I beat you.

725
00:24:48,814 --> 00:24:50,083
(He cuts him off.)

726
00:24:50,084 --> 00:24:52,714
That's why it's odd.

727
00:24:52,715 --> 00:24:54,060
Oh, that's why?

728
00:24:55,755 --> 00:24:57,254
Although I'm only twofold,

729
00:24:57,255 --> 00:24:59,454
if you invest a lot, you'll get a lot.

730
00:24:59,455 --> 00:25:00,553
What?

731
00:25:00,554 --> 00:25:01,793
(Is he coercing them to invest in him?)

732
00:25:01,794 --> 00:25:03,639
- What was that? - Were you threatening us?

733
00:25:03,695 --> 00:25:05,893
Why did he sound like a gambler?

734
00:25:05,894 --> 00:25:07,793
If you bet a lot...

735
00:25:07,794 --> 00:25:09,270
He talks like Agwi.

736
00:25:09,294 --> 00:25:11,033
Isn't it best for everyone?

737
00:25:11,034 --> 00:25:12,709
(He's the Agwi of Running Man.)

738
00:25:13,304 --> 00:25:15,174
- All right. - I have no idea.

739
00:25:15,175 --> 00:25:16,303
So Min, go first.

740
00:25:16,304 --> 00:25:18,343
The ones who are participating can't bet, right?

741
00:25:18,344 --> 00:25:21,313
- No. - No. But if you win,

742
00:25:21,314 --> 00:25:23,744
you'll get five coins per investor.

743
00:25:23,745 --> 00:25:25,290
(They can't bet, but they can gain more coins if they win.)

744
00:25:26,755 --> 00:25:28,790
- They need to try to win. - Right.

745
00:25:29,955 --> 00:25:32,184
(Will the investors successfully bet and strike gold?)

746
00:25:32,185 --> 00:25:34,270
- Who will you bet on? - One coin for Haha.

747
00:25:35,455 --> 00:25:36,964
(She's very careful.)

748
00:25:36,965 --> 00:25:38,969
- That's fine, right? - Yes.

749
00:25:39,824 --> 00:25:41,464
I'd like to bet on Kwang Soo.

750
00:25:41,465 --> 00:25:42,464
(He trusts Kwang Soo.)

751
00:25:42,465 --> 00:25:43,580
One coin.

752
00:25:44,435 --> 00:25:45,909
- All right. - What is it?

753
00:25:46,265 --> 00:25:47,879
You were a scaredy-cat, weren't you?

754
00:25:48,005 --> 00:25:49,303
Weren't you?

755
00:25:49,304 --> 00:25:50,603
- You bet a coin, right? - One coin?

756
00:25:50,604 --> 00:25:51,643
Ji Hyo.

757
00:25:51,644 --> 00:25:54,290
I bet eight coins on Jong Kook.

758
00:25:55,074 --> 00:25:57,214
I bet nine coins on Jong Kook.

759
00:25:57,215 --> 00:25:58,914
(They bet on Jong Kook who seems the most likely to win.)

760
00:25:58,915 --> 00:26:01,714
(All of them finish betting.)

761
00:26:01,715 --> 00:26:05,383
(Jong Kook, Byung Jae, Kwang Soo, Haha)

762
00:26:05,384 --> 00:26:07,399
I will reveal the event.

763
00:26:07,854 --> 00:26:10,063
For this first round,

764
00:26:10,064 --> 00:26:13,063
Jong Kook, Haha, Byung Jae, and Kwang Soo will participate.

765
00:26:13,064 --> 00:26:15,833
(What is the event?)

766
00:26:15,834 --> 00:26:17,863
Withstanding Pain, King of Thighs.

767
00:26:17,864 --> 00:26:19,363
- No! - Come on!

768
00:26:19,364 --> 00:26:21,350
(Withstanding Pain, King of Thighs)

769
00:26:21,505 --> 00:26:24,980
(The contestants have mixed feelings.)

770
00:26:25,005 --> 00:26:26,813
(Hee Jin betted on Haha.)

771
00:26:26,814 --> 00:26:28,643
- Jong Kook will win for sure. - Come, come, come...

772
00:26:28,644 --> 00:26:30,744
- Come on! - Right.

773
00:26:30,745 --> 00:26:32,060
You can do it.

774
00:26:32,344 --> 00:26:34,429
- You can do it, right? - Did you bet on me?

775
00:26:35,084 --> 00:26:37,724
- Gosh. - Jong Kook will win for sure.

776
00:26:37,725 --> 00:26:40,024
I don't feel pain.

777
00:26:40,025 --> 00:26:41,123
Are we using our hands?

778
00:26:41,124 --> 00:26:42,553
Yes, you are.

779
00:26:42,554 --> 00:26:44,770
Haha's rank is unbelievable.

780
00:26:44,894 --> 00:26:47,563
The survey was precise.

781
00:26:47,564 --> 00:26:48,633
I only received one bet?

782
00:26:48,634 --> 00:26:50,133
I will withstand the pain for that person.

783
00:26:50,134 --> 00:26:51,810
- I'll do that. - You only got one bet?

784
00:26:51,864 --> 00:26:52,904
I'll withstand the pain.

785
00:26:52,905 --> 00:26:54,474
- Let me explain the rules. - Okay.

786
00:26:54,475 --> 00:26:55,734
There will be four chairs.

787
00:26:55,735 --> 00:26:57,974
You'll do rock-paper-scissors to decide on the order.

788
00:26:57,975 --> 00:27:00,043
You'll hit the thigh of the person sitting next to you.

789
00:27:00,044 --> 00:27:01,313
You'll roll a die.

790
00:27:01,314 --> 00:27:03,514
You can only hit them if you get an even number.

791
00:27:03,515 --> 00:27:06,219
Please play rock-paper-scissors to decide on the order.

792
00:27:06,284 --> 00:27:08,083
- The order is important. - It's the most important.

793
00:27:08,084 --> 00:27:09,654
(This game will determine who gets hit by whom.)

794
00:27:09,655 --> 00:27:11,724
- First place will... - They'll sit last.

795
00:27:11,725 --> 00:27:12,754
Okay.

796
00:27:12,755 --> 00:27:14,469
- First place will sit last. - Got it.

797
00:27:14,495 --> 00:27:16,654
- Rock-paper-scissors - Rock-paper-scissors

798
00:27:16,655 --> 00:27:18,393
(Kwang Soo comes 1st place.)

799
00:27:18,394 --> 00:27:19,939
- Okay! - You can do it!

800
00:27:20,034 --> 00:27:22,369
This is all for that one investor!

801
00:27:23,165 --> 00:27:24,510
I'll withstand the pain!

802
00:27:25,265 --> 00:27:27,934
- Rock-paper-scissors - Rock-paper-scissors

803
00:27:27,935 --> 00:27:29,909
(Haha wins.)

804
00:27:30,304 --> 00:27:32,504
(He is determined to win.)

805
00:27:32,505 --> 00:27:34,113
- Rock-paper-scissors - Rock-paper-scissors

806
00:27:34,114 --> 00:27:35,843
(Byung Jae comes last.)

807
00:27:35,844 --> 00:27:37,159
Byung Jae, sit first.

808
00:27:37,445 --> 00:27:41,659
(Byung Jae picks his seat first.)

809
00:27:43,054 --> 00:27:44,600
I'm next, right?

810
00:27:45,884 --> 00:27:48,524
(Jong Kook sits down.)

811
00:27:48,525 --> 00:27:50,199
(What is this?)

812
00:27:50,864 --> 00:27:52,724
(He's trying to grasp the situation.)

813
00:27:52,725 --> 00:27:54,340
- Hold on. - Jong Kook.

814
00:27:54,634 --> 00:27:57,333
- He sat well. - You'll sit last since you won.

815
00:27:57,334 --> 00:27:59,204
- No. - The winner will sit last.

816
00:27:59,205 --> 00:28:01,004
- No, ask them about the direction. - The rules aren't correct.

817
00:28:01,005 --> 00:28:02,474
The one who won...

818
00:28:02,475 --> 00:28:04,404
You volunteered to sit last.

819
00:28:04,405 --> 00:28:06,543
But we already agreed that the winner would sit last.

820
00:28:06,544 --> 00:28:08,274
That's exactly where it's wrong.

821
00:28:08,275 --> 00:28:10,359
Winning rock-paper-scissors is a good thing.

822
00:28:10,544 --> 00:28:12,484
- Then you can go first. - Right.

823
00:28:12,485 --> 00:28:13,553
He can pick first.

824
00:28:13,554 --> 00:28:15,353
- The winner should pick first. - Right.

825
00:28:15,354 --> 00:28:16,514
Pick your seat.

826
00:28:16,515 --> 00:28:18,083
(Kwang Soo picks 1st.)

827
00:28:18,084 --> 00:28:19,883
- Second place. - Are we going this way?

828
00:28:19,884 --> 00:28:21,123
Are we?

829
00:28:21,124 --> 00:28:22,154
(He's meticulous.)

830
00:28:22,155 --> 00:28:23,270
All right.

831
00:28:23,594 --> 00:28:24,863
I should sit here.

832
00:28:24,864 --> 00:28:26,194
No, I should.

833
00:28:26,195 --> 00:28:27,494
I should sit here.

834
00:28:27,495 --> 00:28:29,494
(What are they doing?)

835
00:28:29,495 --> 00:28:31,080
Since we're going this way?

836
00:28:31,735 --> 00:28:32,833
Since we're going this way?

837
00:28:32,834 --> 00:28:34,909
What are you three scheming?

838
00:28:35,505 --> 00:28:36,704
What are you talking about?

839
00:28:36,705 --> 00:28:38,643
The order has already been decided.

840
00:28:38,644 --> 00:28:40,419
Jae Seok, what am I supposed to do?

841
00:28:40,945 --> 00:28:42,373
(His fate has been decided.)

842
00:28:42,374 --> 00:28:44,290
What do I need to do so that I won't get hit by him?

843
00:28:44,584 --> 00:28:45,843
Let's do this. Jong Kook can start first.

844
00:28:45,844 --> 00:28:47,883
- 1st place can sit 1st. - Jong Kook.

845
00:28:47,884 --> 00:28:48,954
- Jong Kook. - Yes?

846
00:28:48,955 --> 00:28:50,353
I guess you can see Haha now.

847
00:28:50,354 --> 00:28:51,583
- What? - I guess you can see Haha now.

848
00:28:51,584 --> 00:28:53,459
- He's becoming more visible, right? - Yes.

849
00:28:53,525 --> 00:28:55,424
- I can see his form. - His form?

850
00:28:55,425 --> 00:28:57,293
- Yes. - You mean, like a ghost?

851
00:28:57,294 --> 00:28:58,964
I'm starting to see his form.

852
00:28:58,965 --> 00:29:00,994
- So first place is... - How about Kwang Soo decides?

853
00:29:00,995 --> 00:29:02,464
- Do that. - Let the winner decide.

854
00:29:02,465 --> 00:29:04,533
- Let's do that. - Okay.

855
00:29:04,534 --> 00:29:05,734
Okay, let's do that.

856
00:29:05,735 --> 00:29:08,050
- Rock-paper-scissors - Rock-paper-scissors

857
00:29:08,235 --> 00:29:10,179
(Scissors, Rock)

858
00:29:10,604 --> 00:29:14,744
- Rock-paper-scissors - Rock-paper-scissors

859
00:29:14,745 --> 00:29:16,389
(The winner is chosen.)

860
00:29:16,814 --> 00:29:18,014
- Decide on the order. - Go ahead.

861
00:29:18,015 --> 00:29:21,359
- Are you sure? - I'm going to endure it.

862
00:29:21,455 --> 00:29:23,899
We'll go this way and this is where I'll sit.

863
00:29:24,584 --> 00:29:26,399
- Haha, you can sit here. - Thanks.

864
00:29:26,995 --> 00:29:28,770
- Hold on. - Is this Kwang Soo's seat?

865
00:29:29,624 --> 00:29:31,469
(Jong Kook can sit here.)

866
00:29:31,564 --> 00:29:33,570
- Jong Kook can sit here. - Right.

867
00:29:34,394 --> 00:29:35,633
Who's left will sit next to me.

868
00:29:35,634 --> 00:29:36,810
- You can sit here. - What?

869
00:29:38,465 --> 00:29:39,780
Fine, I'll endure the pain.

870
00:29:40,275 --> 00:29:41,709
Kwang Soo, good luck.

871
00:29:41,804 --> 00:29:43,504
- Good luck. - It's all in the dice anyway.

872
00:29:43,505 --> 00:29:44,643
(Just trust me.)

873
00:29:44,644 --> 00:29:47,113
- It's all in the dice. - Jong Kook, isn't he annoying?

874
00:29:47,114 --> 00:29:49,189
- Right. - Just don't get caught.

875
00:29:49,445 --> 00:29:51,244
Jong Kook answered my question.

876
00:29:51,245 --> 00:29:54,090
(Jong Kook answered my question.)

877
00:29:54,854 --> 00:29:56,924
You can only hit the other person if you roll an even number.

878
00:29:56,925 --> 00:29:57,924
(They must roll an even number to hit the person next to them.)

879
00:29:57,925 --> 00:29:59,399
(Kwang Soo goes first.)

880
00:29:59,854 --> 00:30:01,929
(Drop the dice!)

881
00:30:03,925 --> 00:30:05,224
Four!

882
00:30:05,225 --> 00:30:06,770
(An even number!)

883
00:30:07,495 --> 00:30:09,734
- Haha can't endure this. - You can do it, Haha.

884
00:30:09,735 --> 00:30:10,863
- Good luck. - You're tenfold.

885
00:30:10,864 --> 00:30:12,510
You must endure the pain.

886
00:30:12,705 --> 00:30:14,603
Pork belly will be on me.

887
00:30:14,604 --> 00:30:16,149
He offered pork belly.

888
00:30:16,175 --> 00:30:17,580
Think about it.

889
00:30:17,581 --> 00:30:21,581

890
00:30:21,614 --> 00:30:23,313
(Kwang Soo adds a twist...)

891
00:30:23,314 --> 00:30:25,813
(and aims for the other leg.)

892
00:30:25,814 --> 00:30:27,714
(Grunt)

893
00:30:27,715 --> 00:30:29,383
Wait, he just grunted.

894
00:30:29,384 --> 00:30:30,954
- He grunted. - I heard a grunt.

895
00:30:30,955 --> 00:30:32,224
Okay!

896
00:30:32,225 --> 00:30:33,254
- A grunt. - You're out.

897
00:30:33,255 --> 00:30:34,254
(Haha is eliminated because of a single grunt.)

898
00:30:34,255 --> 00:30:35,893
Kwang Soo went for the other leg.

899
00:30:35,894 --> 00:30:38,264
- He hit me right here. - A single grunt.

900
00:30:38,265 --> 00:30:40,363
(Forgive me. Next up is Byung Jae.)

901
00:30:40,364 --> 00:30:41,709
Go, Byung Jae.

902
00:30:42,265 --> 00:30:43,734
- An even number! - It's an even number.

903
00:30:43,735 --> 00:30:44,964
(Byung Jae also rolls an even number.)

904
00:30:44,965 --> 00:30:46,863
- Byung Jae used to box, you know. - Good luck!

905
00:30:46,864 --> 00:30:50,073
He might injure his hand while slapping Jong Kook.

906
00:30:50,074 --> 00:30:52,373
- Look at his fragile hand. - You're right.

907
00:30:52,374 --> 00:30:54,050
My eldest son's hand is that size.

908
00:30:55,374 --> 00:30:57,719
- It'll hurt. - His thighs seem firm.

909
00:30:58,314 --> 00:31:00,659
He has no chance.

910
00:31:00,854 --> 00:31:02,689
(Byung Jae slaps him with all his might.)

911
00:31:03,084 --> 00:31:04,330
That was cute.

912
00:31:04,455 --> 00:31:05,984
- He yelped. - Byung Jae made a sound.

913
00:31:05,985 --> 00:31:07,053
- Right. - Next time.

914
00:31:07,054 --> 00:31:08,954
- He should be out. - That's not the rule.

915
00:31:08,955 --> 00:31:10,264
He definitely yelped.

916
00:31:10,265 --> 00:31:12,340
- But I was the one slapping him. - There's no point to this.

917
00:31:12,965 --> 00:31:14,633
I told you it'd hurt your hand more.

918
00:31:14,634 --> 00:31:15,909
That's right.

919
00:31:16,235 --> 00:31:18,063
(The dice has been rolled.)

920
00:31:18,064 --> 00:31:20,404
(Please let it be an odd number.)

921
00:31:20,405 --> 00:31:21,510
Gosh.

922
00:31:23,705 --> 00:31:25,780
- It's an even number. - An even number.

923
00:31:27,175 --> 00:31:28,714
- He's wearing jeans. - Let's hear a loud slap.

924
00:31:28,715 --> 00:31:30,214
- Oh, no. - Make it sound loud.

925
00:31:30,215 --> 00:31:31,984
Oh, dear.

926
00:31:31,985 --> 00:31:33,484
- Let's speed things up. - It's over.

927
00:31:33,485 --> 00:31:36,689
(He'll soon be executed.)

928
00:31:38,384 --> 00:31:39,424
I'm holding onto him.

929
00:31:39,425 --> 00:31:40,869
(Slap!)

930
00:31:40,995 --> 00:31:42,530
Hold on...

931
00:31:42,894 --> 00:31:43,964
(Kwang Soo, breathe!)

932
00:31:43,965 --> 00:31:46,323
He kind of made a sound.

933
00:31:46,324 --> 00:31:47,793
Yes, like this.

934
00:31:47,794 --> 00:31:49,533
Is that so?

935
00:31:49,534 --> 00:31:51,580
- Are you all right? - He's out.

936
00:31:51,905 --> 00:31:53,040
You're out.

937
00:31:53,604 --> 00:31:55,480
Right...

938
00:31:56,104 --> 00:31:57,274
(Hold on a second.)

939
00:31:57,275 --> 00:31:59,073
- Are you all right? - He's out.

940
00:31:59,074 --> 00:32:01,490
- He's out. - Let's continue.

941
00:32:01,515 --> 00:32:03,320
His thigh is throbbing.

942
00:32:03,915 --> 00:32:04,990
He's out.

943
00:32:05,344 --> 00:32:06,444
(The dice is rolled.)

944
00:32:06,445 --> 00:32:08,714
- He needs a taste of it. - Okay, we're done.

945
00:32:08,715 --> 00:32:11,000
(It's another even number.)

946
00:32:11,425 --> 00:32:13,129
I feel so bad for you.

947
00:32:13,725 --> 00:32:15,770
(Byung Jae, stay strong.)

948
00:32:15,794 --> 00:32:17,639
He'll probably scream before Jong Kook raises his hand.

949
00:32:19,624 --> 00:32:21,793
(Something just jolted.)

950
00:32:21,794 --> 00:32:23,340
(Yelling in pain)

951
00:32:24,235 --> 00:32:27,103
Yes. Go, Jong Kook!

952
00:32:27,104 --> 00:32:30,474
- Kim Jong Kook! - Seriously?

953
00:32:30,475 --> 00:32:31,744
- Kim Jong Kook. - Kim Jong Kook.

954
00:32:31,745 --> 00:32:32,873
- Nice. - Okay.

955
00:32:32,874 --> 00:32:35,274
- All right. - What a sweet win.

956
00:32:35,275 --> 00:32:36,313
Did you know?

957
00:32:36,314 --> 00:32:38,744
Investing in Jong Kook meant that you'd win double.

958
00:32:38,745 --> 00:32:40,654
Four people bet on him.

959
00:32:40,655 --> 00:32:41,883
(They each doubled what they invested.)

960
00:32:41,884 --> 00:32:45,684
Meanwhile, Jong Kook wins 5 coins per person which is 20.

961
00:32:45,685 --> 00:32:46,984
Okay, good.

962
00:32:46,985 --> 00:32:49,093
I bet on Kwang Soo for nothing.

963
00:32:49,094 --> 00:32:50,524
It's impossible to endure.

964
00:32:50,525 --> 00:32:52,264
I only bet one though.

965
00:32:52,265 --> 00:32:53,264
(He's not much of a risk-taker.)

966
00:32:53,265 --> 00:32:55,734
Two people bet on Kwang Soo and Haha each,

967
00:32:55,735 --> 00:32:57,063
but no one bet on Byung Jae.

968
00:32:57,064 --> 00:32:58,063
What?

969
00:32:58,064 --> 00:33:00,063
(But no one bet on Byung Jae.)

970
00:33:00,064 --> 00:33:01,504
(Then who did Byung Jae play the game for?)

971
00:33:01,505 --> 00:33:02,504
Really?

972
00:33:02,505 --> 00:33:04,004
Then what did you endure the pain for?

973
00:33:04,005 --> 00:33:05,504
I did it for the people counting on me.

974
00:33:05,505 --> 00:33:07,343
What a shame.

975
00:33:07,344 --> 00:33:08,514
(Current Number of Coins)

976
00:33:08,515 --> 00:33:09,613
(Jong Kook is in the lead with 30 coins.)

977
00:33:09,614 --> 00:33:10,744
(Hee Jin is in last place with 8 coins.)

978
00:33:10,745 --> 00:33:13,083
It's now time for our next game.

979
00:33:13,084 --> 00:33:15,113
We always order from this place when we're in this neighborhood.

980
00:33:15,114 --> 00:33:16,454
- Yes! - The jjamppong!

981
00:33:16,455 --> 00:33:17,783
- It's to die for. - The Chinese restaurant.

982
00:33:17,784 --> 00:33:19,883
- It's truly amazing. - It's the best.

983
00:33:19,884 --> 00:33:21,393
We will order you lunch,

984
00:33:21,394 --> 00:33:23,553
but first, you'll split into two teams...

985
00:33:23,554 --> 00:33:26,424
and play Say Food Name at the End.

986
00:33:26,425 --> 00:33:27,964
(Say Food Name at the End)

987
00:33:27,965 --> 00:33:29,863
- Okay. - The losing team...

988
00:33:29,864 --> 00:33:32,264
will have to pay for their lunch with R coins.

989
00:33:32,265 --> 00:33:34,103
- What? - You'll take our coins?

990
00:33:34,104 --> 00:33:35,904
Yes, you'll pay up 10 coins in total.

991
00:33:35,905 --> 00:33:37,873
- That's a lot. - It's not a small number.

992
00:33:37,874 --> 00:33:39,004
- I only have 10. - So...

993
00:33:39,005 --> 00:33:40,873
Please split into two teams.

994
00:33:40,874 --> 00:33:42,889
- We'll play Race of Wits. - Sure.

995
00:33:42,915 --> 00:33:45,484
We'll play Race of Wits to decide the teams.

996
00:33:45,485 --> 00:33:46,613
How many games will it take though?

997
00:33:46,614 --> 00:33:48,659
- What? - How many games will that take?

998
00:33:49,255 --> 00:33:51,730
He should see a specialist regarding this obsession.

999
00:33:51,884 --> 00:33:53,083
How many are we?

1000
00:33:53,084 --> 00:33:54,093
- There are 12 of us. - There are 12 of us.

1001
00:33:54,094 --> 00:33:56,593
Then the first six will form a team.

1002
00:33:56,594 --> 00:33:58,293
- The first 6? - The first 6 to lose?

1003
00:33:58,294 --> 00:33:59,593
Yes, that's right.

1004
00:33:59,594 --> 00:34:02,063
- That's not so bad. - Right?

1005
00:34:02,064 --> 00:34:04,264
Let's begin then. And go.

1006
00:34:04,265 --> 00:34:06,533
(They begin Race of Wits to decide the teams.)

1007
00:34:06,534 --> 00:34:08,004
- 1. - 2.

1008
00:34:08,005 --> 00:34:09,474
- 3. - 4.

1009
00:34:09,475 --> 00:34:11,679
(They quickly reach 4.)

1010
00:34:13,005 --> 00:34:14,643
(The others...)

1011
00:34:14,644 --> 00:34:17,984
(only glance at one another.)

1012
00:34:17,985 --> 00:34:19,614
(Silent...)

1013
00:34:19,615 --> 00:34:20,614
- Hold on. - This team...

1014
00:34:20,615 --> 00:34:22,013
Is no one standing up because of the current members?

1015
00:34:22,014 --> 00:34:23,353
That must be it.

1016
00:34:23,354 --> 00:34:25,484
No one's standing up because they don't like this team.

1017
00:34:25,485 --> 00:34:26,484
Hold on.

1018
00:34:26,485 --> 00:34:28,953
- Is that why? - It really is a game of wits.

1019
00:34:28,954 --> 00:34:30,964
We all could tell that it was a sinking ship.

1020
00:34:30,965 --> 00:34:32,723
Guys, sit down for a second.

1021
00:34:32,724 --> 00:34:34,393
- This is wrong. - Why?

1022
00:34:34,394 --> 00:34:36,833
Why? You four are a team.

1023
00:34:36,834 --> 00:34:38,004
No one is willing to join us.

1024
00:34:38,005 --> 00:34:39,333
Hold on.

1025
00:34:39,334 --> 00:34:40,534
The game isn't over yet.

1026
00:34:40,535 --> 00:34:41,603
Ji Hyo!

1027
00:34:41,604 --> 00:34:43,534
You're the one who suggested the game.

1028
00:34:43,535 --> 00:34:46,774
- Fine, have a seat. - You only need two more members.

1029
00:34:46,775 --> 00:34:48,174
This is odd.

1030
00:34:48,175 --> 00:34:49,574
- How about this instead? - Go on.

1031
00:34:49,575 --> 00:34:52,484
- We have to try it first. - The first six to lose are a team.

1032
00:34:52,485 --> 00:34:53,853
Okay, sounds good.

1033
00:34:53,854 --> 00:34:55,484
The first six to lose will be a team.

1034
00:34:55,485 --> 00:34:57,330
Good. Let's begin.

1035
00:34:57,485 --> 00:34:58,524
- 1. - 2.

1036
00:34:58,525 --> 00:34:59,884
Okay, that's two.

1037
00:34:59,885 --> 00:35:01,529
- 3. - 4.

1038
00:35:02,525 --> 00:35:03,594
Five.

1039
00:35:03,595 --> 00:35:05,100
- Six. - Okay.

1040
00:35:05,224 --> 00:35:06,364
- Are they a team? - No.

1041
00:35:06,365 --> 00:35:07,563
- The first six to lose. - That's right.

1042
00:35:07,564 --> 00:35:08,639
Seven.

1043
00:35:10,164 --> 00:35:11,203
- 8. - 8.

1044
00:35:11,204 --> 00:35:12,304
(Jong Kook and Kwang Soo said 8 at the same time.)

1045
00:35:12,305 --> 00:35:13,464
- You and Jong Kook. - That's two.

1046
00:35:13,465 --> 00:35:14,804
Is it because you wanted to team up with him?

1047
00:35:14,805 --> 00:35:16,274
You wanted to be on his team.

1048
00:35:16,275 --> 00:35:17,504
- Wait... - It was kind of obvious.

1049
00:35:17,505 --> 00:35:18,804
You were slightly late.

1050
00:35:18,805 --> 00:35:20,103
It was obvious.

1051
00:35:20,104 --> 00:35:21,290
You think I did it on purpose?

1052
00:35:21,874 --> 00:35:23,413
(Kwang Soo's eyes are on Jong Kook.)

1053
00:35:23,414 --> 00:35:26,989
(He repeated Jong Kook's number and pretended to be upset.)

1054
00:35:27,255 --> 00:35:29,513
- You think I did it on purpose? - Was it to be on his team?

1055
00:35:29,514 --> 00:35:31,953
- No, I was going to say eight. - Okay, fine.

1056
00:35:31,954 --> 00:35:33,683
All right. You two are a team.

1057
00:35:33,684 --> 00:35:35,770
- Have a seat then. - Is this how it'll be?

1058
00:35:37,325 --> 00:35:39,563
- Get ready... - The losers will be on our team.

1059
00:35:39,564 --> 00:35:40,563
Right.

1060
00:35:40,564 --> 00:35:42,094
And go!

1061
00:35:42,095 --> 00:35:43,310
- 1. - 1.

1062
00:35:43,365 --> 00:35:45,004
- And go! - 1.

1063
00:35:45,005 --> 00:35:46,703
(Applicants make a rush for it.)

1064
00:35:46,704 --> 00:35:47,904
I said it too.

1065
00:35:47,905 --> 00:35:49,634
- Really? - Me too.

1066
00:35:49,635 --> 00:35:51,804
- I said it too. - Me too.

1067
00:35:51,805 --> 00:35:53,880
- Get over here. - This game was a bad idea.

1068
00:35:53,914 --> 00:35:55,219
The rest will join me.

1069
00:35:55,414 --> 00:35:57,413
We need one more on our team.

1070
00:35:57,414 --> 00:35:58,743
Come on!

1071
00:35:58,744 --> 00:36:00,313
- We'll send one over. - We need one more.

1072
00:36:00,314 --> 00:36:01,614
Play rock-paper-scissors.

1073
00:36:01,615 --> 00:36:02,654
Let's play rock-paper-scissors.

1074
00:36:02,655 --> 00:36:04,123
The one who loses will join our team.

1075
00:36:04,124 --> 00:36:05,900
- Rock-paper-scissors - Rock-paper-scissors

1076
00:36:06,084 --> 00:36:07,393
(Han Na and Seok Jin lose.)

1077
00:36:07,394 --> 00:36:08,793
- Rock-paper-scissors - Rock-paper-scissors

1078
00:36:08,794 --> 00:36:10,429
(Seok Jin loses!)

1079
00:36:11,195 --> 00:36:12,263
Nice.

1080
00:36:12,264 --> 00:36:13,263
(And so the teams are decided.)

1081
00:36:13,264 --> 00:36:16,770
(The teams)

1082
00:36:16,994 --> 00:36:20,779
So now you'll play Say Food Name at the End.

1083
00:36:20,805 --> 00:36:22,034
The rules are just like that of a word relay.

1084
00:36:22,035 --> 00:36:24,304
The last person just has to name a food at the end.

1085
00:36:24,305 --> 00:36:25,980
You win if you go around in a circle twice.

1086
00:36:26,005 --> 00:36:28,473
Can the words only be in three Korean syllables?

1087
00:36:28,474 --> 00:36:29,813
Yes, that's right.

1088
00:36:29,814 --> 00:36:31,813
However, the food doesn't have to follow that rule.

1089
00:36:31,814 --> 00:36:33,743
- Right. - No words can be repeated.

1090
00:36:33,744 --> 00:36:35,284
- Right. - Let's wish us luck!

1091
00:36:35,285 --> 00:36:36,654
- Go! - Let's do this.

1092
00:36:36,655 --> 00:36:38,699
This is for the jjamppong.

1093
00:36:38,755 --> 00:36:40,529
(What?)

1094
00:36:40,954 --> 00:36:43,054
(They're constantly reminded of the song.)

1095
00:36:43,055 --> 00:36:45,094
- What was that? Gosh. - That came from nowhere.

1096
00:36:45,095 --> 00:36:47,094
Why did you suddenly sing that? How about "Get Up"?

1097
00:36:47,095 --> 00:36:48,594
You're using up your energy.

1098
00:36:48,595 --> 00:36:49,594
Nice.

1099
00:36:49,595 --> 00:36:51,063
- We'll begin. - Let's do this!

1100
00:36:51,064 --> 00:36:52,364
(She's embarrassed by her song from 20 years ago.)

1101
00:36:52,365 --> 00:36:54,174
- We'll give you the first word. - Right.

1102
00:36:54,175 --> 00:36:56,150
Let's do a practice round first.

1103
00:36:56,334 --> 00:36:58,973
- Kung, kung, kung - Kung, kung, kung

1104
00:36:58,974 --> 00:37:01,214
- Kungkungtta, kungkungtta - Kungkungtta, kungkungtta

1105
00:37:01,215 --> 00:37:03,889
- Say a food name at the end - Say a food name at the end

1106
00:37:04,744 --> 00:37:05,819
Gorilla.

1107
00:37:06,115 --> 00:37:07,284
Radio.

1108
00:37:07,285 --> 00:37:09,513
(Gorilla, Radio...)

1109
00:37:09,514 --> 00:37:10,754
Audio.

1110
00:37:10,755 --> 00:37:12,853
(Gorilla, Radio, Audio...)

1111
00:37:12,854 --> 00:37:13,960
Arcade.

1112
00:37:14,555 --> 00:37:16,324
Laboratory.

1113
00:37:16,325 --> 00:37:17,940
(Gorilla, Radio, Audio, Arcade, Laboratory...)

1114
00:37:18,124 --> 00:37:21,694
(He has to name a food that starts with "shil" in Korean.)

1115
00:37:21,695 --> 00:37:22,893
Struggling soup.

1116
00:37:22,894 --> 00:37:25,063
(Gorilla, Radio, Audio, Arcade, Laboratory, Struggling soup)

1117
00:37:25,064 --> 00:37:26,464
(What's a struggling soup?)

1118
00:37:26,465 --> 00:37:28,634
What on earth is a struggling soup?

1119
00:37:28,635 --> 00:37:30,274
Seriously?

1120
00:37:30,275 --> 00:37:31,719
Does that exist?

1121
00:37:31,974 --> 00:37:33,643
Is it a soup you make while in a struggle?

1122
00:37:33,644 --> 00:37:35,214
(It can also be a dialect for "wildcat.")

1123
00:37:35,215 --> 00:37:36,913
- In an altercation. - Bring me the soup!

1124
00:37:36,914 --> 00:37:38,444
(Arguing)

1125
00:37:38,445 --> 00:37:40,013
- A struggle... - What is that?

1126
00:37:40,014 --> 00:37:41,554
I think I ate it in Jincheon.

1127
00:37:41,555 --> 00:37:42,984
Get up from that seat.

1128
00:37:42,985 --> 00:37:45,100
- Come on. - Go again.

1129
00:37:45,124 --> 00:37:47,699
Here we go then. Ready, begin.

1130
00:37:47,994 --> 00:37:49,393
- Kung, kung, kung - Kung, kung, kung

1131
00:37:49,394 --> 00:37:50,424
Stay with basic words.

1132
00:37:50,425 --> 00:37:52,293
- Kungkungtta, kungkungtta - Kungkungtta, kungkungtta

1133
00:37:52,294 --> 00:37:54,964
- Say a food name at the end - Say a food name at the end

1134
00:37:54,965 --> 00:37:56,263
(The first syllable is "bu.")

1135
00:37:56,264 --> 00:37:58,004
Like father, like son.

1136
00:37:58,005 --> 00:37:59,804
(Like father, like son)

1137
00:37:59,805 --> 00:38:00,804
(Like father,)

1138
00:38:00,805 --> 00:38:01,980
(like son)

1139
00:38:02,474 --> 00:38:03,603
You could've said "parents."

1140
00:38:03,604 --> 00:38:05,373
Your turn is over now.

1141
00:38:05,374 --> 00:38:07,274
Gosh.

1142
00:38:07,275 --> 00:38:08,743
- He's sick, that's why. - Make way.

1143
00:38:08,744 --> 00:38:09,873
What do you mean he's sick?

1144
00:38:09,874 --> 00:38:11,183
He falters when the camera is only on him.

1145
00:38:11,184 --> 00:38:12,384
Anyway, move.

1146
00:38:12,385 --> 00:38:13,913
- He's sick, that's all. - Let's sit.

1147
00:38:13,914 --> 00:38:15,453
What?

1148
00:38:15,454 --> 00:38:17,190
- Are you guys ready? - Yes.

1149
00:38:17,285 --> 00:38:19,424
Here we go. Ready, begin.

1150
00:38:19,425 --> 00:38:21,893
- Kung, kung, kung - Kung, kung, kung

1151
00:38:21,894 --> 00:38:24,563
- Kungkungtta, kungkungtta - Kungkungtta, kungkungtta

1152
00:38:24,564 --> 00:38:27,333
- Say a food name at the end - Say a food name at the end

1153
00:38:27,334 --> 00:38:28,333
(The first syllable is "jang.")

1154
00:38:28,334 --> 00:38:29,409
Jang Su Won.

1155
00:38:29,965 --> 00:38:31,239
Monkey.

1156
00:38:31,635 --> 00:38:32,779
Barbershop.

1157
00:38:33,334 --> 00:38:35,004
Head manager.

1158
00:38:35,005 --> 00:38:36,234
Im Chang Jung.

1159
00:38:36,235 --> 00:38:37,444
(Jang Su Won, Monkey, Barbershop, Head manager, Im Chang Jung)

1160
00:38:37,445 --> 00:38:39,404
(She only needs to name a food that starts with "jung" in Korean.)

1161
00:38:39,405 --> 00:38:41,049
A delicious snail.

1162
00:38:41,244 --> 00:38:43,114
(Incorrect!)

1163
00:38:43,115 --> 00:38:44,743
(A delicious snail.)

1164
00:38:44,744 --> 00:38:45,884
Why not?

1165
00:38:45,885 --> 00:38:47,884
- What was that? - It makes sense.

1166
00:38:47,885 --> 00:38:49,183
It doesn't. It's our turn now.

1167
00:38:49,184 --> 00:38:50,924
Why isn't that allowed?

1168
00:38:50,925 --> 00:38:52,884
Hold on. Why isn't that allowed?

1169
00:38:52,885 --> 00:38:54,969
What if I said, "a snail dish made with love"?

1170
00:38:55,155 --> 00:38:57,194
- Sounds good to me. - We should swap seats.

1171
00:38:57,195 --> 00:38:58,893
Give us another chance...

1172
00:38:58,894 --> 00:38:59,993
because we didn't get a practice round.

1173
00:38:59,994 --> 00:39:01,234
No can do.

1174
00:39:01,235 --> 00:39:02,694
We never practiced.

1175
00:39:02,695 --> 00:39:05,004
- But we... - You're out.

1176
00:39:05,005 --> 00:39:06,364
We started right away!

1177
00:39:06,365 --> 00:39:08,404
(We started without practice!)

1178
00:39:08,405 --> 00:39:10,004
(They're shoved away.)

1179
00:39:10,005 --> 00:39:11,004
(Scared)

1180
00:39:11,005 --> 00:39:12,643
- We started right away. - You're right.

1181
00:39:12,644 --> 00:39:14,004
We started right away.

1182
00:39:14,005 --> 00:39:15,420
- Let us try one more time. - We didn't get to practice.

1183
00:39:15,575 --> 00:39:16,913
- Hey. - Guys.

1184
00:39:16,914 --> 00:39:18,389
We didn't lose.

1185
00:39:18,514 --> 00:39:20,884
- It's just that he's persuasive. - Right.

1186
00:39:20,885 --> 00:39:22,259
(If you say so.)

1187
00:39:22,385 --> 00:39:23,784
- It's not that... - Are you sure?

1188
00:39:23,785 --> 00:39:25,529
- we're scared of Jong Kook. - Of course not.

1189
00:39:25,825 --> 00:39:27,869
- You're not intimidated, are you? - Are you?

1190
00:39:28,255 --> 00:39:29,754
(Never)

1191
00:39:29,755 --> 00:39:30,940
Jong Kook has a point.

1192
00:39:31,365 --> 00:39:32,464
Start.

1193
00:39:32,465 --> 00:39:34,433
- Kung, kung, kung - Kung, kung, kung

1194
00:39:34,434 --> 00:39:36,364
- Kungkungtta, kungkungtta - Kungkungtta, kungkungtta

1195
00:39:36,365 --> 00:39:38,440
- Say a food name at the end - Say a food name at the end

1196
00:39:38,505 --> 00:39:40,440
- One, two... - Jee Seok Jin.

1197
00:39:41,334 --> 00:39:43,350
Jeans... Hold on.

1198
00:39:44,275 --> 00:39:46,174
(Jeans?)

1199
00:39:46,175 --> 00:39:47,619
Qin Shi Huang! You punk!

1200
00:39:48,575 --> 00:39:49,719
I'm sorry.

1201
00:39:50,244 --> 00:39:51,460
You're out.

1202
00:39:51,544 --> 00:39:54,884
You messed up last week, and you make another mistake?

1203
00:39:54,885 --> 00:39:57,330
- But it makes him notice me now. - You're happy?

1204
00:39:57,354 --> 00:39:58,900
He notices my mistake.

1205
00:39:59,255 --> 00:40:00,654
- Start. - Slowly.

1206
00:40:00,655 --> 00:40:02,893
- Kung, kung, kung - But it shouldn't be too slow.

1207
00:40:02,894 --> 00:40:05,464
- Kungkungtta, kungkungtta - Kungkungtta, kungkungtta

1208
00:40:05,465 --> 00:40:08,409
- Say a food name at the end - Say a food name at the end

1209
00:40:08,934 --> 00:40:10,194
Jun Ji Hyun.

1210
00:40:10,195 --> 00:40:11,409
Hyun Jung Hwa.

1211
00:40:11,834 --> 00:40:13,040
Bathroom.

1212
00:40:13,505 --> 00:40:14,679
Silmido.

1213
00:40:15,405 --> 00:40:16,580
Lunchbox.

1214
00:40:17,275 --> 00:40:18,350
Lunchbox.

1215
00:40:19,505 --> 00:40:20,603
"Rak"?

1216
00:40:20,604 --> 00:40:22,549
(What's a food name that starts with "rak"?)

1217
00:40:22,744 --> 00:40:24,384
You gave her "rak"?

1218
00:40:24,385 --> 00:40:25,583
Lock and Lock...

1219
00:40:25,584 --> 00:40:27,259
What food name starts with "rak"?

1220
00:40:27,345 --> 00:40:29,313
Why did you have to give her "rak"?

1221
00:40:29,314 --> 00:40:30,714
- How could you... - Seriously.

1222
00:40:30,715 --> 00:40:33,429
Also, after saying that word, he looked so cold.

1223
00:40:33,525 --> 00:40:34,869
"It's up to you."

1224
00:40:35,695 --> 00:40:36,830
"I'm innocent."

1225
00:40:37,965 --> 00:40:39,100
YooA, I'm sorry.

1226
00:40:39,365 --> 00:40:40,893
- I'm so sorry. - He said,

1227
00:40:40,894 --> 00:40:42,239
"Rak, rak, rak."

1228
00:40:43,365 --> 00:40:44,804
You must be so hurt.

1229
00:40:44,805 --> 00:40:46,634
- I'm sorry. - How could you do this to me?

1230
00:40:46,635 --> 00:40:47,674
You guys are out.

1231
00:40:47,675 --> 00:40:48,774
Start.

1232
00:40:48,775 --> 00:40:50,710
(Thanks to Jae Seok's word choice, Team Jong Kook gets another chance.)

1233
00:40:50,905 --> 00:40:52,873
- Kungkungtta, kungkungtta - Kungkungtta, kungkungtta

1234
00:40:52,874 --> 00:40:55,489
- Say a food name at the end - Say a food name at the end

1235
00:40:56,075 --> 00:40:57,190
Squid.

1236
00:40:57,814 --> 00:40:58,920
Fish shop.

1237
00:40:59,814 --> 00:41:01,029
Fir tree.

1238
00:41:01,615 --> 00:41:02,730
Risky move.

1239
00:41:03,514 --> 00:41:04,659
Swimming pool.

1240
00:41:05,425 --> 00:41:07,770
Eel soup.

1241
00:41:09,055 --> 00:41:11,540
(They've finally finished one round.)

1242
00:41:12,664 --> 00:41:14,569
Rice bowl.

1243
00:41:15,264 --> 00:41:16,364
"Reut"?

1244
00:41:16,365 --> 00:41:17,663
("Reut"?)

1245
00:41:17,664 --> 00:41:19,063
(What 3-syllable word starts with "reut"?)

1246
00:41:19,064 --> 00:41:20,103
Hey!

1247
00:41:20,104 --> 00:41:21,650
I said, "eel soup!"

1248
00:41:22,204 --> 00:41:24,243
- That word ends the game. - Are you on our team?

1249
00:41:24,244 --> 00:41:26,279
- You could have said, "rice thief." - Thank you.

1250
00:41:26,575 --> 00:41:28,049
There are so many words that start with "rice."

1251
00:41:28,445 --> 00:41:30,719
So Min saved us with "rice bowl."

1252
00:41:30,945 --> 00:41:33,243
Let's play one last round.

1253
00:41:33,244 --> 00:41:34,353
- Okay. - One last round.

1254
00:41:34,354 --> 00:41:35,353
It's the last round.

1255
00:41:35,354 --> 00:41:37,154
(The team that says more words winds.)

1256
00:41:37,155 --> 00:41:41,100
(Team Jong Kook said 7 words. How will Team Jae Seok do?)

1257
00:41:41,595 --> 00:41:42,670
Mortgage.

1258
00:41:43,055 --> 00:41:44,170
Shortcut.

1259
00:41:45,025 --> 00:41:46,139
Travel partner.

1260
00:41:46,965 --> 00:41:50,110
Knee.

1261
00:41:50,365 --> 00:41:52,634
(Pak?)

1262
00:41:52,635 --> 00:41:54,163
(Fail)

1263
00:41:54,164 --> 00:41:55,574
- Hey. - Pak?

1264
00:41:55,575 --> 00:41:57,509
What word starts with "pak"?

1265
00:41:57,644 --> 00:41:59,203
Park Chan Ho.

1266
00:41:59,204 --> 00:42:01,089
(There is a word.)

1267
00:42:02,314 --> 00:42:03,549
Park Ji Sung.

1268
00:42:04,584 --> 00:42:06,259
- Pronunciation is key. - Right.

1269
00:42:06,744 --> 00:42:07,989
Okay.

1270
00:42:08,115 --> 00:42:09,453
Too bad.

1271
00:42:09,454 --> 00:42:11,554
You guys got to the fifth word, so team Jong Kook wins.

1272
00:42:11,555 --> 00:42:13,429
(R Coin Distribution)

1273
00:42:13,454 --> 00:42:15,223
Byung Jae, Hee Jin, and YooA, eat a lot.

1274
00:42:15,224 --> 00:42:16,594
- Enjoy. - Enjoy.

1275
00:42:16,595 --> 00:42:18,100
Let's eat.

1276
00:42:18,164 --> 00:42:20,569
It smells nice and smoky.

1277
00:42:20,624 --> 00:42:21,964
(Slurping)

1278
00:42:21,965 --> 00:42:23,239
It tastes so good.

1279
00:42:24,334 --> 00:42:26,234
- It's delicious. - It tastes so good.

1280
00:42:26,235 --> 00:42:28,534
Byung Jae, do you have a girlfriend?

1281
00:42:28,535 --> 00:42:29,710
Not at the moment.

1282
00:42:30,235 --> 00:42:31,304
When did you break up?

1283
00:42:31,305 --> 00:42:33,404
- It's been a few years. - A few years?

1284
00:42:33,405 --> 00:42:34,719
Byung Jae is a nice guy.

1285
00:42:34,845 --> 00:42:36,089
Byung Jae is amazing.

1286
00:42:38,345 --> 00:42:39,884
But no one seems to want to set him up with anyone.

1287
00:42:39,885 --> 00:42:42,083
(That's on point.)

1288
00:42:42,084 --> 00:42:45,060
- Is that it? - All you say is, "He's amazing."

1289
00:42:45,525 --> 00:42:47,560
- What kind of girl do you like? - I like...

1290
00:42:48,255 --> 00:42:50,230
Even though I might not be able to meet my type...

1291
00:42:50,695 --> 00:42:52,964
- I like the cute type. - The cute type?

1292
00:42:52,965 --> 00:42:55,069
- So Min is very cute. - She is.

1293
00:42:55,564 --> 00:42:56,893
(So Min is a perfect example of a cute girl.)

1294
00:42:56,894 --> 00:42:58,480
- She is, but... - Are you talking about appearances?

1295
00:42:58,664 --> 00:42:59,964
I'm not talking about a girl who looks cute...

1296
00:42:59,965 --> 00:43:01,933
- or tries to do cute things. - Then?

1297
00:43:01,934 --> 00:43:03,603
I like a girl who is a bit clumsy.

1298
00:43:03,604 --> 00:43:04,973
So Min is very clumsy.

1299
00:43:04,974 --> 00:43:06,074
- She's really clumsy. - I'm very clumsy.

1300
00:43:06,075 --> 00:43:07,203
That's not what I mean.

1301
00:43:07,204 --> 00:43:09,020
(That's not what I mean.)

1302
00:43:09,644 --> 00:43:10,790
I mean...

1303
00:43:10,874 --> 00:43:14,243
I like a girl who does her best but still is clumsy.

1304
00:43:14,244 --> 00:43:16,054
- That's So Min. - She has food all over her face.

1305
00:43:16,055 --> 00:43:18,029
That's not what I mean either.

1306
00:43:19,385 --> 00:43:21,469
(Determined)

1307
00:43:21,595 --> 00:43:23,324
I like a girl who is cute but doesn't know she is.

1308
00:43:23,325 --> 00:43:24,723
- I don't. - She doesn't.

1309
00:43:24,724 --> 00:43:25,864
She really doesn't.

1310
00:43:25,865 --> 00:43:26,924
You're not my type.

1311
00:43:26,925 --> 00:43:28,933
(Straightforward)

1312
00:43:28,934 --> 00:43:30,469
(He turns her down.)

1313
00:43:30,865 --> 00:43:32,040
I like cute girls.

1314
00:43:32,104 --> 00:43:33,239
You're not his type.

1315
00:43:33,305 --> 00:43:34,880
I don't like guys who have a beard either.

1316
00:43:35,874 --> 00:43:37,009
I'm relieved.

1317
00:43:38,104 --> 00:43:39,203
(The lunch break is over.)

1318
00:43:39,204 --> 00:43:41,473
Let me announce who will play the second game.

1319
00:43:41,474 --> 00:43:42,614
Please look at the board.

1320
00:43:42,615 --> 00:43:44,089
It's too hard.

1321
00:43:45,115 --> 00:43:46,759
- What? - Ji Hyo?

1322
00:43:46,845 --> 00:43:48,813
- Jae Seok is at the top? - Ten times for Se Chan?

1323
00:43:48,814 --> 00:43:50,630
Could it be a quiz?

1324
00:43:50,715 --> 00:43:52,123
- It's a quiz! No. - It's a quiz.

1325
00:43:52,124 --> 00:43:53,623
It can't be a quiz.

1326
00:43:53,624 --> 00:43:54,893
- It's not a quiz. - No.

1327
00:43:54,894 --> 00:43:56,369
The viewers don't know her well.

1328
00:43:56,425 --> 00:43:58,424
Jae Seok came in first place,

1329
00:43:58,425 --> 00:44:00,324
- Ji Hyo in fifth place, - Fifth place?

1330
00:44:00,325 --> 00:44:01,909
Hee Jin in seventh place,

1331
00:44:01,994 --> 00:44:03,933
and Se Chan in 12th place.

1332
00:44:03,934 --> 00:44:05,440
- He's at the bottom. - One by one...

1333
00:44:05,535 --> 00:44:06,634
Haha, you go first.

1334
00:44:06,635 --> 00:44:08,110
(Haha will invest in a member first.)

1335
00:44:08,874 --> 00:44:12,449
(How many coins will he invest in who?)

1336
00:44:13,005 --> 00:44:15,543
(After thinking for a moment...)

1337
00:44:15,544 --> 00:44:17,290
I invest nine coins in Jae Seok.

1338
00:44:18,314 --> 00:44:20,089
I invest two coins in Ji Hyo.

1339
00:44:21,584 --> 00:44:22,853
(Meanwhile, So Min...)

1340
00:44:22,854 --> 00:44:23,960
Hey.

1341
00:44:23,985 --> 00:44:25,123
Are you confident?

1342
00:44:25,124 --> 00:44:26,929
(She asks Se Chan a question.)

1343
00:44:27,555 --> 00:44:30,694
(So Min sounds so bold.)

1344
00:44:30,695 --> 00:44:33,170
(It gives Se Chan confidence.)

1345
00:44:33,294 --> 00:44:34,810
It's the power of love.

1346
00:44:35,095 --> 00:44:36,663
- You can bet on me. - Are you confident?

1347
00:44:36,664 --> 00:44:38,310
Yes, bet on me.

1348
00:44:38,934 --> 00:44:40,980
Bet one more coin than you originally thought.

1349
00:44:42,405 --> 00:44:43,710
I'll go double.

1350
00:44:44,505 --> 00:44:45,574
I bet six.

1351
00:44:45,575 --> 00:44:46,873
(Unbelievable)

1352
00:44:46,874 --> 00:44:48,043
(So Min bets 6 coins on Se Chan.)

1353
00:44:48,044 --> 00:44:50,389
Is So Min betting on Se Chan?

1354
00:44:50,945 --> 00:44:52,114
I bet five.

1355
00:44:52,115 --> 00:44:53,259
(She gets cold feet.)

1356
00:44:53,684 --> 00:44:55,913
(She decides to be more realistic.)

1357
00:44:55,914 --> 00:44:57,083
Was she lying?

1358
00:44:57,084 --> 00:44:58,460
(Did she really bet on me?)

1359
00:44:58,724 --> 00:45:00,254
(Jae Seok, Ji Hyo, Hee Jin, Se Chan)

1360
00:45:00,255 --> 00:45:01,400
We're done.

1361
00:45:01,825 --> 00:45:04,324
Here's the game Jae Seok, Ji Hyo, Se Chan,

1362
00:45:04,325 --> 00:45:06,940
and Hee Jin will play.

1363
00:45:07,095 --> 00:45:08,540
Please.

1364
00:45:08,894 --> 00:45:10,864
The general knowledge quiz, The Quiz King.

1365
00:45:10,865 --> 00:45:12,009
(The general knowledge quiz, The Quiz King)

1366
00:45:12,434 --> 00:45:13,563
(Jae Seok, Ji Hyo, Hee Jin, Se Chan)

1367
00:45:13,564 --> 00:45:18,020
(Survey Result, 100 votes in total)

1368
00:45:18,445 --> 00:45:19,603
(It really was a quiz.)

1369
00:45:19,604 --> 00:45:21,319
I'm doomed.

1370
00:45:22,744 --> 00:45:23,850
I'm doomed.

1371
00:45:24,615 --> 00:45:27,190
(Haha is happy about betting 9 coins on Jae Seok.)

1372
00:45:27,514 --> 00:45:31,183
The one who survives the longest becomes the final winner.

1373
00:45:31,184 --> 00:45:33,960
But you don't get to answer simply by raising your hand.

1374
00:45:33,985 --> 00:45:36,293
We'll play rock-paper-scissors, and the person who plays...

1375
00:45:36,294 --> 00:45:37,793
the same thing as me gets to answer.

1376
00:45:37,794 --> 00:45:39,663
If you say the wrong answer, you're out for that question.

1377
00:45:39,664 --> 00:45:41,433
Two outs eliminate you from the game.

1378
00:45:41,434 --> 00:45:42,864
The person who survives the longest wins.

1379
00:45:42,865 --> 00:45:45,080
What if there are two people left? Do they both write their answers?

1380
00:45:45,664 --> 00:45:47,933
- What happens? - They both get to answer.

1381
00:45:47,934 --> 00:45:49,274
- Okay. - Let's do this.

1382
00:45:49,275 --> 00:45:51,504
- It's a history question. - Gosh.

1383
00:45:51,505 --> 00:45:52,819
I have no idea.

1384
00:45:52,845 --> 00:45:54,074
It's an easy one.

1385
00:45:54,075 --> 00:45:55,420
- Don't play the same thing as him. - I can't do this.

1386
00:45:55,675 --> 00:45:57,589
He was a king of Joseon.

1387
00:45:58,084 --> 00:46:00,543
He was the third son of Taejong Yi Bang Won...

1388
00:46:00,544 --> 00:46:03,330
and called Grand Prince Chungnyeong. Who is he?

1389
00:46:03,555 --> 00:46:04,799
- Pardon? - Let's play rock-paper-scissors.

1390
00:46:05,624 --> 00:46:07,659
- Grand Prince Chungnyeong? - Yi Bang Won's third son?

1391
00:46:07,724 --> 00:46:09,730
Don't play the same thing as me.

1392
00:46:09,794 --> 00:46:11,100
- Rock-paper-scissors - Rock-paper-scissors

1393
00:46:11,764 --> 00:46:13,623
(Ji Hyo has to answer.)

1394
00:46:13,624 --> 00:46:15,063
- Ji Hyo. - Ji Hyo.

1395
00:46:15,064 --> 00:46:17,040
- Please write your answer. - I managed to escape.

1396
00:46:17,965 --> 00:46:21,380
Ji Hyo will reveal herself to the world now.

1397
00:46:21,974 --> 00:46:23,404
Did he become the king in the end?

1398
00:46:23,405 --> 00:46:24,619
(By any chance...)

1399
00:46:24,845 --> 00:46:26,973
Can't you give Ji Hyo some more time to write her answer?

1400
00:46:26,974 --> 00:46:28,013
He was the king.

1401
00:46:28,014 --> 00:46:29,543
Oh, that's good.

1402
00:46:29,544 --> 00:46:31,190
(The person became the king in the end.)

1403
00:46:31,615 --> 00:46:33,460
- 1, 2, 3. - The sushi king.

1404
00:46:34,285 --> 00:46:35,984
(Seok Jin distracts Ji Hyo.)

1405
00:46:35,985 --> 00:46:37,353
- The sushi king? - What's that?

1406
00:46:37,354 --> 00:46:39,830
(Yi Bang Won's third son was the sushi king?)

1407
00:46:41,224 --> 00:46:43,524
You're not allowed to distract her.

1408
00:46:43,525 --> 00:46:45,024
- Leave her alone. - Sejong the Great.

1409
00:46:45,025 --> 00:46:46,270
(Ji Hyo says her answer.)

1410
00:46:47,217 --> 00:46:48,393
Sejong the Great.

1411
00:46:50,002 --> 00:46:51,121
Sejong the Great.

1412
00:46:51,122 --> 00:46:55,181
(Is "Sejong the Great" correct?)

1413
00:46:55,182 --> 00:46:57,702
and called Grand Prince Chungnyeong. Who is he?

1414
00:46:57,703 --> 00:46:58,879
Sejong the Great.

1415
00:47:00,469 --> 00:47:01,569
Sejong the Great.

1416
00:47:01,570 --> 00:47:03,268
(Is "Sejong the Great" correct?)

1417
00:47:03,269 --> 00:47:04,509
Sejong the Great.

1418
00:47:04,510 --> 00:47:05,714
It's correct.

1419
00:47:06,610 --> 00:47:11,355
(Yi Bang Won's 3rd son, Grand Prince Chungnyeong, became the 4th king.)

1420
00:47:11,750 --> 00:47:14,018
(She got it right?)

1421
00:47:14,019 --> 00:47:15,755
- She's incredible. - Great job.

1422
00:47:15,756 --> 00:47:20,158
Sejong the Great is the only king Ji Hyo has heard of!

1423
00:47:20,159 --> 00:47:22,428
(She made use of all the historical knowledge she has.)

1424
00:47:22,429 --> 00:47:24,234
- She got lucky. - That's not true.

1425
00:47:24,429 --> 00:47:26,875
- She got lucky. - It's not like that.

1426
00:47:27,199 --> 00:47:29,299
- That's not true. - She knows only one king,

1427
00:47:29,300 --> 00:47:30,844
- and that's Sejong the Great. - No.

1428
00:47:31,030 --> 00:47:32,774
- She got lucky. - I know more.

1429
00:47:33,369 --> 00:47:34,499
Sejong the Great!

1430
00:47:34,500 --> 00:47:36,109
(I'd like to share this joy with Sejong the Great.)

1431
00:47:36,110 --> 00:47:38,444
(Let's all shout the name of Sejong the Great!)

1432
00:47:39,110 --> 00:47:40,754
- Ji Hyo got it right. - Oh, my.

1433
00:47:41,780 --> 00:47:43,825
- I knew it. - Ji Hyo's off the hook now.

1434
00:47:44,179 --> 00:47:45,325
I knew it.

1435
00:47:45,519 --> 00:47:47,455
- It's a mystery. - Here's the next question.

1436
00:47:48,119 --> 00:47:51,464
What do you call a voluntarily childless couple...

1437
00:47:51,550 --> 00:47:53,888
where both partners work?

1438
00:47:53,889 --> 00:47:55,064
What did you say?

1439
00:47:56,130 --> 00:47:57,564
(Ji Hyo drops her head.)

1440
00:47:57,760 --> 00:47:59,729
It's easy. It's DINKs.

1441
00:47:59,730 --> 00:48:00,959
DINKs.

1442
00:48:00,960 --> 00:48:02,044
As in Hiddink.

1443
00:48:02,269 --> 00:48:03,444
I'm not sure.

1444
00:48:04,900 --> 00:48:06,339
(Hee Jin has no idea.)

1445
00:48:06,340 --> 00:48:07,999
- Let's play rock-paper-scissors. - He can get it right.

1446
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:09,009
- It's easy. - Let's play rock-paper-scissors.

1447
00:48:09,010 --> 00:48:10,669
- It's easy. - Rock-paper-scissors

1448
00:48:10,670 --> 00:48:11,808
- Rock-paper-scissors - Rock-paper-scissors

1449
00:48:11,809 --> 00:48:12,839
(The person who will solve the second question is...)

1450
00:48:12,840 --> 00:48:13,939
(Ji Hyo again.)

1451
00:48:13,940 --> 00:48:15,884
- It's Ji Hyo again. - Is it Ji Hyo again?

1452
00:48:17,280 --> 00:48:18,794
You know the answer, right?

1453
00:48:18,980 --> 00:48:21,855
- I... - You know, right?

1454
00:48:22,119 --> 00:48:23,718
- I am sure I saw it somewhere. - Get on People.

1455
00:48:23,719 --> 00:48:25,459
(Get on People)

1456
00:48:25,460 --> 00:48:27,788
(Working couples who don't have kids are called "Get on People"?)

1457
00:48:27,789 --> 00:48:29,364
Orange People.

1458
00:48:30,130 --> 00:48:31,464
Orange People.

1459
00:48:31,860 --> 00:48:32,899
Queue People.

1460
00:48:32,900 --> 00:48:33,928
(Even "Queue People" appears.)

1461
00:48:33,929 --> 00:48:36,444
Stop distracting her.

1462
00:48:36,469 --> 00:48:37,844
Mohe People. Mohe People.

1463
00:48:39,139 --> 00:48:40,538
Mohe People.

1464
00:48:40,539 --> 00:48:42,538
Gosh, I heard it somewhere. Hold on.

1465
00:48:42,539 --> 00:48:44,844
Ji Hyo, you will get it right if you think hard.

1466
00:48:44,969 --> 00:48:46,185
You can do it.

1467
00:48:46,340 --> 00:48:48,948
- Hold on. - 3, 2, 1.

1468
00:48:48,949 --> 00:48:50,109
(Time's up.)

1469
00:48:50,110 --> 00:48:52,325
- The answer is "DINKs." - That's right. DINKs.

1470
00:48:52,550 --> 00:48:54,649
The acronym stands for "Double income, no kids."

1471
00:48:54,650 --> 00:48:55,988
(Working couples who purposefully don't have kids)

1472
00:48:55,989 --> 00:48:57,888
I thought it was "Tofu People."

1473
00:48:57,889 --> 00:48:59,319
You should have said something.

1474
00:48:59,320 --> 00:49:00,964
- "Tofu People"? - Where did that come from?

1475
00:49:01,190 --> 00:49:02,359
Here comes the next one.

1476
00:49:02,360 --> 00:49:04,459
"What's the name of the infectious disease..."

1477
00:49:04,460 --> 00:49:06,359
"caused by the bacteria Yersinia pestis..."

1478
00:49:06,360 --> 00:49:08,234
"that swept over Europe in the 14th century?"

1479
00:49:08,500 --> 00:49:10,305
- My goodness. - This one is hard.

1480
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:12,098
Rock-paper-scissors.

1481
00:49:12,099 --> 00:49:13,999
(Jae Seok and Hee Jin play the same hand.)

1482
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:15,714
- Okay. - Jae Seok and Hee Jin.

1483
00:49:15,769 --> 00:49:17,009
My goodness.

1484
00:49:17,010 --> 00:49:18,738
- Does he know the answer? - The previous ones were easy.

1485
00:49:18,739 --> 00:49:20,055
You know the answer, right?

1486
00:49:21,179 --> 00:49:23,009
(Did Se Chan figure out the answer?)

1487
00:49:23,010 --> 00:49:24,355
Does Se Chan know the answer?

1488
00:49:24,449 --> 00:49:26,055
I figured it out too.

1489
00:49:26,619 --> 00:49:27,649
Write down the answer as a bonus round.

1490
00:49:27,650 --> 00:49:28,765
(Se Chan participates as a bonus round.)

1491
00:49:29,590 --> 00:49:31,165
Write it down.

1492
00:49:32,389 --> 00:49:34,319
(Does Se Chan know the answer?)

1493
00:49:34,320 --> 00:49:36,328
- Write it down. - I... Is it wrong?

1494
00:49:36,329 --> 00:49:39,129
- Should I erase it? Is it wrong? - One.

1495
00:49:39,130 --> 00:49:40,428
Two.

1496
00:49:40,429 --> 00:49:41,999
- Three. - I don't know.

1497
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:43,674
- Three. - I don't know.

1498
00:49:44,070 --> 00:49:45,368
- "Bubonic plague" is correct. - Really?

1499
00:49:45,369 --> 00:49:46,899
(Jae Seok is correct and Hee Jin is incorrect.)

1500
00:49:46,900 --> 00:49:48,839
(Bubonic plague is spread through infected fleas.)

1501
00:49:48,840 --> 00:49:50,009
Everyone.

1502
00:49:50,010 --> 00:49:51,569
Take a look at Se Chan's answer.

1503
00:49:51,570 --> 00:49:53,078
(Se Chan wrote down the answer confidently.)

1504
00:49:53,079 --> 00:49:55,424
(Extremely curious)

1505
00:49:56,679 --> 00:49:57,848
Eczema.

1506
00:49:57,849 --> 00:50:02,364
(Was eczema widespread from the 14th century?)

1507
00:50:02,750 --> 00:50:04,189
It is about the skin.

1508
00:50:04,190 --> 00:50:06,435
That's why I thought it was eczema.

1509
00:50:07,389 --> 00:50:08,788
- Okay. - Okay.

1510
00:50:08,789 --> 00:50:10,658
(Jae Seok wins the second game as expected.)

1511
00:50:10,659 --> 00:50:11,988
Thus, for Jae Seok...

1512
00:50:11,989 --> 00:50:13,459
5 times 3 is 15. So he wins 15 coins.

1513
00:50:13,460 --> 00:50:15,259
- 15 coins. That's good. - And...

1514
00:50:15,260 --> 00:50:16,698
Jae Seok's investors will get...

1515
00:50:16,699 --> 00:50:19,299
- twice the coins they invested. - Okay.

1516
00:50:19,300 --> 00:50:21,975
I thought about investing in Jae Seok.

1517
00:50:23,210 --> 00:50:27,384
(Current Number of R Coins)

1518
00:50:28,039 --> 00:50:29,279
(Only the last round remains!)

1519
00:50:29,280 --> 00:50:32,395
Let me announce the members who will play the last game.

1520
00:50:32,449 --> 00:50:34,319
- The last game? - There will be a twist this time.

1521
00:50:34,320 --> 00:50:37,194
- So far, the top 1 has won. - You must invest in the top 1.

1522
00:50:37,289 --> 00:50:38,549
How many members will play?

1523
00:50:38,550 --> 00:50:39,665
YooA is in first place?

1524
00:50:39,760 --> 00:50:41,259
- I get it. - So Min is in second place.

1525
00:50:41,260 --> 00:50:42,888
It must be about dance.

1526
00:50:42,889 --> 00:50:44,959
- Dance. - Dance or flexibility.

1527
00:50:44,960 --> 00:50:46,598
If YooA is in first place, it must be about dance.

1528
00:50:46,599 --> 00:50:48,375
- Of course. - Dance.

1529
00:50:48,500 --> 00:50:50,475
YooA is in first place.

1530
00:50:51,170 --> 00:50:52,939
Hee Jin is in second place.

1531
00:50:52,940 --> 00:50:54,268
- Me? - It must be dance.

1532
00:50:54,269 --> 00:50:56,038
- Dance or flexibility. - Dance.

1533
00:50:56,039 --> 00:50:58,484
Kwang Soo and Han Na are in seventh place.

1534
00:50:58,780 --> 00:51:01,379
- Han NA can do... - She dances like a middle-aged man.

1535
00:51:01,380 --> 00:51:02,678
a limited number of dances.

1536
00:51:02,679 --> 00:51:04,379
I don't know the most recent dances.

1537
00:51:04,380 --> 00:51:06,319
- But I do know a few dances. - Do a dance of S.E.S.

1538
00:51:06,320 --> 00:51:07,879
- What? - Do it.

1539
00:51:07,880 --> 00:51:10,125
There was a dance I showed you.

1540
00:51:11,989 --> 00:51:14,134
(What?)

1541
00:51:15,460 --> 00:51:18,029
(Sloppy)

1542
00:51:18,030 --> 00:51:19,605
- Something doesn't seem right. - Hey.

1543
00:51:20,630 --> 00:51:22,844
- Something doesn't seem right. - The dance moves look strange.

1544
00:51:22,900 --> 00:51:24,729
- Are you imitating a worm? - It looks strange.

1545
00:51:24,730 --> 00:51:26,339
How could she make simple moves look strange?

1546
00:51:26,340 --> 00:51:27,669
- It looks strange. - Are you imitating a tadpole?

1547
00:51:27,670 --> 00:51:29,915
- Why are you bobbing your head? - Are you imitating a tadpole?

1548
00:51:29,940 --> 00:51:32,238
- What? - Your dance doesn't look right.

1549
00:51:32,239 --> 00:51:33,408
- Seriously. - It doesn't look right.

1550
00:51:33,409 --> 00:51:35,254
She has Seok Jin's dance skills.

1551
00:51:35,309 --> 00:51:37,049
I know the dances for the old K-Pop songs.

1552
00:51:37,050 --> 00:51:39,678
It's time for you to choose which member to invest in.

1553
00:51:39,679 --> 00:51:41,448
If Seok Jin wins...

1554
00:51:41,449 --> 00:51:42,848
and the investors get 10 times the coins...

1555
00:51:42,849 --> 00:51:43,919
I will grit my teeth.

1556
00:51:43,920 --> 00:51:44,988
(Invest in me!)

1557
00:51:44,989 --> 00:51:46,018
Invest in me.

1558
00:51:46,019 --> 00:51:48,464
(They suddenly burst out laughing.)

1559
00:51:48,789 --> 00:51:50,004
My goodness.

1560
00:51:50,690 --> 00:51:52,734
You are so mean.

1561
00:51:53,400 --> 00:51:54,504
Jong Kook is ridiculous.

1562
00:51:55,059 --> 00:51:56,098
"10 times?"

1563
00:51:56,099 --> 00:51:57,575
"He is a grandpa."

1564
00:51:59,670 --> 00:52:00,844
10 times?

1565
00:52:01,969 --> 00:52:03,344
He is a grandpa.

1566
00:52:03,969 --> 00:52:05,209
Seok Jin is...

1567
00:52:05,210 --> 00:52:07,314
(Laughing)

1568
00:52:07,510 --> 00:52:10,154
(The younger members burst out laughing.)

1569
00:52:10,380 --> 00:52:12,225
Why won't you say anything?

1570
00:52:13,250 --> 00:52:15,495
- What? Were they talking about me? - Yes.

1571
00:52:15,949 --> 00:52:18,464
(This grandpa can't make out words.)

1572
00:52:18,820 --> 00:52:20,665
Please make a bet now.

1573
00:52:20,760 --> 00:52:22,428
I don't know.

1574
00:52:22,429 --> 00:52:24,928
- You should invest in So Min. - Right?

1575
00:52:24,929 --> 00:52:27,299
Se Chan, I invested five coins in you earlier.

1576
00:52:27,300 --> 00:52:28,299
Right.

1577
00:52:28,300 --> 00:52:30,768
Se Chan, I invested five coins in you earlier too.

1578
00:52:30,769 --> 00:52:33,944
(Speaking cutely)

1579
00:52:34,469 --> 00:52:36,209
- This is driving me crazy. - Se Chan.

1580
00:52:36,210 --> 00:52:37,339
I will go first.

1581
00:52:37,340 --> 00:52:38,339
(Se Chan goes first.)

1582
00:52:38,340 --> 00:52:40,585
You will reveal how many coins I got later, right?

1583
00:52:40,710 --> 00:52:43,924
(Since this is the last game, they need to invest carefully!)

1584
00:52:44,380 --> 00:52:46,578
(YooA, So Min, Han Na, and Seok Jin)

1585
00:52:46,579 --> 00:52:48,594
(How many coins did the members invest?)

1586
00:52:48,949 --> 00:52:51,524
I made the best decision possible.

1587
00:52:51,619 --> 00:52:53,259
Seok Jin, So Min,

1588
00:52:53,260 --> 00:52:54,888
Han Na, and YooA...

1589
00:52:54,889 --> 00:52:56,959
- will have... - Let's see what it is.

1590
00:52:56,960 --> 00:52:59,058
the dance match, The Dance King.

1591
00:52:59,059 --> 00:53:00,428
- All right. - It's dance.

1592
00:53:00,429 --> 00:53:03,069
This isn't half bad. I have a chance.

1593
00:53:03,070 --> 00:53:06,569
When the dance video pauses,

1594
00:53:06,570 --> 00:53:09,339
do the next dance move to succeed.

1595
00:53:09,340 --> 00:53:10,669
- Thank goodness. - My goodness.

1596
00:53:10,670 --> 00:53:12,209
So Min can do this.

1597
00:53:12,210 --> 00:53:15,685
The member who gets the most number of questions wins.

1598
00:53:15,750 --> 00:53:18,055
- I think YooA will win. - If the dances are old...

1599
00:53:18,150 --> 00:53:20,049
- If the dances are old... - That's right.

1600
00:53:20,050 --> 00:53:22,325
Then Seok Jin will have a chance.

1601
00:53:22,389 --> 00:53:23,919
Come on out.

1602
00:53:23,920 --> 00:53:25,694
Let's decide on the order.

1603
00:53:25,920 --> 00:53:27,618
So Min knows many old dances.

1604
00:53:27,619 --> 00:53:29,134
I don't know any recent dances.

1605
00:53:29,230 --> 00:53:31,129
If everyone gets it wrong,

1606
00:53:31,130 --> 00:53:33,029
the one who got it the closest will win.

1607
00:53:33,030 --> 00:53:34,499
Okay. Then I will show all the dance moves.

1608
00:53:34,500 --> 00:53:36,245
I don't know any dance.

1609
00:53:36,269 --> 00:53:38,828
The last two games we played didn't have room...

1610
00:53:38,829 --> 00:53:41,598
for an unexpected result, but this one is different.

1611
00:53:41,599 --> 00:53:43,245
If Seok Jin wins, the investors get 10 times the coins.

1612
00:53:43,809 --> 00:53:45,408
- All right. Rock-paper-scissors. - Rock-paper-scissors

1613
00:53:45,409 --> 00:53:46,509
I lost.

1614
00:53:46,510 --> 00:53:47,879
- Rock-paper-scissors - I won, right?

1615
00:53:47,880 --> 00:53:49,754
Is it more advantageous to go first?

1616
00:53:49,780 --> 00:53:51,549
What? No, it isn't.

1617
00:53:51,550 --> 00:53:53,725
- You are going 1st. - 1st.

1618
00:53:54,280 --> 00:53:55,924
- You are going 2nd. - 2nd?

1619
00:53:56,489 --> 00:53:58,549
- You are going third. - Does the order change?

1620
00:53:58,550 --> 00:53:59,665
I am going fourth.

1621
00:53:59,760 --> 00:54:01,618
It could be advantageous for Han Na...

1622
00:54:01,619 --> 00:54:02,928
since she can study the others' dances.

1623
00:54:02,929 --> 00:54:03,928
- That's right. - I will study them.

1624
00:54:03,929 --> 00:54:05,564
It was good for her to win at rock-paper-scissors.

1625
00:54:06,199 --> 00:54:08,774
Look at her. She is warming up.

1626
00:54:09,530 --> 00:54:10,729
(Flexible)

1627
00:54:10,730 --> 00:54:13,344
I will watch and copy YooA.

1628
00:54:13,440 --> 00:54:14,839
I will copy her.

1629
00:54:14,840 --> 00:54:16,785
I will tie my hair like YooA.

1630
00:54:16,909 --> 00:54:18,339
That's right, YooA.

1631
00:54:18,340 --> 00:54:19,609
(She is ridiculous.)

1632
00:54:19,610 --> 00:54:22,524
Let's begin. Play the video.

1633
00:54:23,079 --> 00:54:24,209
Play the video.

1634
00:54:24,210 --> 00:54:25,779
(What could be the first song?)

1635
00:54:25,780 --> 00:54:28,395
- What is that? - It's H.O.T.

1636
00:54:28,449 --> 00:54:32,319
("Candy" has signature dance moves of moving the arms sideways...)

1637
00:54:32,320 --> 00:54:35,335
(as well as the Power Racer Dance and Hammer Dance.)

1638
00:54:36,590 --> 00:54:37,828
(The song came out when YooA was 2 years old.)

1639
00:54:37,829 --> 00:54:39,174
What is she going to do?

1640
00:54:40,829 --> 00:54:41,959
(YooA begins to dance.)

1641
00:54:41,960 --> 00:54:43,799
She knows the dance!

1642
00:54:43,800 --> 00:54:45,044
YooA knows the dance.

1643
00:54:45,900 --> 00:54:47,174
When the video pauses...

1644
00:54:48,900 --> 00:54:49,968
(If she continues on after the pause, she succeeds!)

1645
00:54:49,969 --> 00:54:51,314
She is dancing perfectly.

1646
00:54:51,969 --> 00:54:53,178
(Does she know the dance?)

1647
00:54:53,179 --> 00:54:54,254
She knows the dance.

1648
00:54:54,710 --> 00:54:55,779
That's incredible.

1649
00:54:55,780 --> 00:54:57,279
- Let's go. - It starts now.

1650
00:54:57,280 --> 00:54:58,678
- Let's go. - It starts now.

1651
00:54:58,679 --> 00:55:00,618
(Does YooA know the dance of a song that came out when she was 2?)

1652
00:55:00,619 --> 00:55:01,749
Let's go!

1653
00:55:01,750 --> 00:55:03,024
(Does YooA know the dance of a song that came out when she was 2?)

1654
00:55:04,650 --> 00:55:05,658
That's incredible.

1655
00:55:05,659 --> 00:55:06,734
- "I just love you". - It starts now.

1656
00:55:10,530 --> 00:55:13,134
(She continues on with the dance.)

1657
00:55:14,230 --> 00:55:17,499
(Do you remember the dance?)

1658
00:55:17,500 --> 00:55:18,799
(The answer)

1659
00:55:18,800 --> 00:55:22,984
(H.O.T.'s mega-hit song covered the nation with white balloons.)

1660
00:55:24,010 --> 00:55:28,955
(The signature dance move involves swinging the arms sideways.)

1661
00:55:29,210 --> 00:55:32,855
(Will YooA be able to do the dance?)

1662
00:55:35,579 --> 00:55:37,364
(The investors show different reactions.)

1663
00:55:38,219 --> 00:55:41,194
(The signature dance moves are almost the same!)

1664
00:55:41,719 --> 00:55:43,134
(She is really good.)

1665
00:55:44,730 --> 00:55:46,634
She is really good.

1666
00:55:47,059 --> 00:55:48,428
Hey, her dance moves are...

1667
00:55:48,429 --> 00:55:49,729
nearly accurate.

1668
00:55:49,730 --> 00:55:52,105
(She brings back the memories of the past!)

1669
00:55:52,500 --> 00:55:54,444
Her dance moves are nearly perfect.

1670
00:55:54,469 --> 00:55:56,209
(YooA's investor is highly satisfied.)

1671
00:55:56,210 --> 00:55:57,569
Her dance moves were nearly perfect.

1672
00:55:57,570 --> 00:55:58,738
(YooA got the signature dance moves nearly perfectly.)

1673
00:55:58,739 --> 00:55:59,808
You know the dance.

1674
00:55:59,809 --> 00:56:02,109
So Min, you have a chance.

1675
00:56:02,110 --> 00:56:04,209
- You know the dance. - Yes.

1676
00:56:04,210 --> 00:56:06,018
- It's Seok Jin's turn. - My goodness.

1677
00:56:06,019 --> 00:56:07,279
Seok Jin.

1678
00:56:07,280 --> 00:56:08,794
My heart is racing.

1679
00:56:09,219 --> 00:56:10,448
(Flailing)

1680
00:56:10,449 --> 00:56:11,665
My goodness.

1681
00:56:13,190 --> 00:56:14,835
Go with your feeling.

1682
00:56:15,460 --> 00:56:18,805
(What kind of "Candy" will he show?)

1683
00:56:21,559 --> 00:56:23,975
(My goodness.)

1684
00:56:24,630 --> 00:56:27,145
(His struggle makes everyone's heart ache.)

1685
00:56:27,969 --> 00:56:29,984
I can't watch this.

1686
00:56:30,010 --> 00:56:31,814
- My goodness. - What is that?

1687
00:56:31,969 --> 00:56:34,238
I told you he is a grandpa.

1688
00:56:34,239 --> 00:56:37,055
- Grandpa! Grandpa! - Grandpa! Grandpa!

1689
00:56:37,150 --> 00:56:38,908
(They feel bad for him.)

1690
00:56:38,909 --> 00:56:40,594
Please stop.

1691
00:56:40,880 --> 00:56:42,279
Seok Jin.

1692
00:56:42,280 --> 00:56:44,189
Why are you making the idol group's dance...

1693
00:56:44,190 --> 00:56:46,359
look so oily?

1694
00:56:46,360 --> 00:56:49,305
- Grandpa! Grandpa! - Grandpa! Grandpa!

1695
00:56:49,989 --> 00:56:51,288
So Min is up next.

1696
00:56:51,289 --> 00:56:52,928
I know the dance.

1697
00:56:52,929 --> 00:56:54,459
- That was different. - I know the dance.

1698
00:56:54,460 --> 00:56:56,928
- So Min, let's go! - Let's go!

1699
00:56:56,929 --> 00:56:58,205
- So Min, let's go! - Let's go!

1700
00:56:59,139 --> 00:57:03,308
(So Min runs through the memories of the time she was a fan of H.O.T.)

1701
00:57:03,309 --> 00:57:05,609
Let's go! Come on!

1702
00:57:05,610 --> 00:57:07,654
(H.O.T., are you watching this?)

1703
00:57:08,280 --> 00:57:10,325
(Her dance moves are spot on!)

1704
00:57:10,610 --> 00:57:13,154
(The investors are satisfied.)

1705
00:57:14,449 --> 00:57:15,948
- That's good. - She is good.

1706
00:57:15,949 --> 00:57:18,024
(Having been a fan, her dance is on point!)

1707
00:57:18,219 --> 00:57:20,058
She is good.

1708
00:57:20,059 --> 00:57:21,388
So Min, let's go!

1709
00:57:21,389 --> 00:57:23,529
(Perfect)

1710
00:57:23,530 --> 00:57:24,705
All right.

1711
00:57:26,599 --> 00:57:27,598
(She even shows the Racer Dance.)

1712
00:57:27,599 --> 00:57:28,904
Okay!

1713
00:57:29,769 --> 00:57:31,569
- She is good. - You didn't have to do that.

1714
00:57:31,570 --> 00:57:32,799
She is good.

1715
00:57:32,800 --> 00:57:34,268
- Han Na. - Han Na.

1716
00:57:34,269 --> 00:57:36,868
- That's from the earlier part. - Don't go over the top.

1717
00:57:36,869 --> 00:57:39,209
- Let's go. - I studied So Min's dance.

1718
00:57:39,210 --> 00:57:41,214
Double it. Double it.

1719
00:57:41,510 --> 00:57:44,625
Come on. Get the order right.

1720
00:57:47,949 --> 00:57:50,649
- She is hilarious. - 1, 2, 3.

1721
00:57:50,650 --> 00:57:51,825
She is hilarious.

1722
00:57:54,920 --> 00:57:57,765
(She shows a sloppy dance.)

1723
00:57:59,059 --> 00:58:01,205
(The investor who is seeing his stocks decline)

1724
00:58:02,159 --> 00:58:03,968
(She ignores Kwang Soo...)

1725
00:58:03,969 --> 00:58:04,999
(and continues to show her sloppy dance.)

1726
00:58:05,000 --> 00:58:07,368
Why is she moving her legs that way?

1727
00:58:07,369 --> 00:58:08,714
Her legs...

1728
00:58:08,739 --> 00:58:10,408
It's the opposite side!

1729
00:58:10,409 --> 00:58:12,314
- What's wrong with her? - Keep going.

1730
00:58:12,340 --> 00:58:13,955
She's so funny.

1731
00:58:14,409 --> 00:58:17,178
(She reinterpreted "Candy" in her own style.)

1732
00:58:17,179 --> 00:58:19,419
- What's wrong with her legs? - She's so funny.

1733
00:58:19,420 --> 00:58:21,018
She's so funny.

1734
00:58:21,019 --> 00:58:22,094
(Other investors are more than satisfied.)

1735
00:58:22,750 --> 00:58:24,118
That was fine.

1736
00:58:24,119 --> 00:58:26,234
- How do you do this? - Flimsy legs.

1737
00:58:26,460 --> 00:58:27,589
- That was so funny. - That's what she did.

1738
00:58:27,590 --> 00:58:28,618
Han Na.

1739
00:58:28,619 --> 00:58:31,459
- Doesn't it go like this? - That was indeed Han Na.

1740
00:58:31,460 --> 00:58:32,999
She was pointing her arm and leg on the same side.

1741
00:58:33,000 --> 00:58:34,375
(She still gets the maximum price for the laugh.)

1742
00:58:34,500 --> 00:58:36,098
We went over the results,

1743
00:58:36,099 --> 00:58:38,399
and YooA wins and gets first place.

1744
00:58:38,400 --> 00:58:39,399
(YooA wins round one.)

1745
00:58:39,400 --> 00:58:40,598
She gets first place.

1746
00:58:40,599 --> 00:58:41,899
(YooA has 1 point.)

1747
00:58:41,900 --> 00:58:44,038
- I knew she was going to win. - She was really good.

1748
00:58:44,039 --> 00:58:47,178
But if none of you know the dance perfectly,

1749
00:58:47,179 --> 00:58:48,709
the person who dances with most energy wins.

1750
00:58:48,710 --> 00:58:50,348
- With energy. - Han Na...

1751
00:58:50,349 --> 00:58:51,448
- and Seok Jin, - That's true.

1752
00:58:51,449 --> 00:58:52,979
- Try your best. - Good luck.

1753
00:58:52,980 --> 00:58:54,718
- Next. - What order would you like to go?

1754
00:58:54,719 --> 00:58:56,319
- Order. - Keep it the same.

1755
00:58:56,320 --> 00:58:58,325
Who's going first?

1756
00:58:59,090 --> 00:59:00,988
- So Min. - So Min's first.

1757
00:59:00,989 --> 00:59:02,359
- Then Han Na, - Right.

1758
00:59:02,360 --> 00:59:03,888
- and Seok Jin. - All right.

1759
00:59:03,889 --> 00:59:05,459
(So Min, Han Na, Seok Jin, and YooA)

1760
00:59:05,460 --> 00:59:06,634
I'm in trouble.

1761
00:59:07,059 --> 00:59:08,399
Play the music.

1762
00:59:08,400 --> 00:59:10,174
So Min is a good dancer too.

1763
00:59:13,039 --> 00:59:14,598
("So Cool" by SISTAR was released in 2011.)

1764
00:59:14,599 --> 00:59:16,285
(The signature dance move involves flailing movements.)

1765
00:59:16,610 --> 00:59:18,939
I don't know. I don't know this.

1766
00:59:18,940 --> 00:59:20,384
- I don't know this. - Look at YooA's face.

1767
00:59:20,809 --> 00:59:23,484
(The chorus part is the second question.)

1768
00:59:24,210 --> 00:59:25,448
(You can almost remember it.)

1769
00:59:25,449 --> 00:59:27,955
(Here's the answer for the viewers.)

1770
00:59:28,079 --> 00:59:31,919
(The answer)

1771
00:59:31,920 --> 00:59:35,094
(You're supposed to rub your neck.)

1772
00:59:36,260 --> 00:59:38,165
I don't know this.

1773
00:59:39,500 --> 00:59:40,575
What do I do?

1774
00:59:40,800 --> 00:59:41,875
Do I start?

1775
00:59:42,360 --> 00:59:43,475
Cool.

1776
00:59:43,730 --> 00:59:45,674
(What? Does she know it?)

1777
00:59:45,940 --> 00:59:47,198
(Was it supposed to be that aggressive?)

1778
00:59:47,199 --> 00:59:49,408
- Is that it? - She's correct.

1779
00:59:49,409 --> 00:59:50,509
(She's seductive.)

1780
00:59:50,510 --> 00:59:52,439
- Who's that? - She's correct.

1781
00:59:52,440 --> 00:59:54,754
It's the correct dance.

1782
00:59:54,940 --> 00:59:56,408
(She thinks she's sexy,)

1783
00:59:56,409 --> 00:59:57,678
She's correct.

1784
00:59:57,679 --> 00:59:59,149
(so her mouth opens naturally.)

1785
00:59:59,150 --> 01:00:01,654
She's correct. Keep going!

1786
01:00:01,780 --> 01:00:03,348
Be bold!

1787
01:00:03,349 --> 01:00:05,348
So Min, be bold.

1788
01:00:05,349 --> 01:00:06,919
- What's the problem? - Excuse me.

1789
01:00:06,920 --> 01:00:09,529
So Min, did you rub dirt off your skin?

1790
01:00:09,530 --> 01:00:10,529
(She took a bath thanks to SISTAR's dance.)

1791
01:00:10,530 --> 01:00:12,828
- So Min, - Yes?

1792
01:00:12,829 --> 01:00:14,158
did you rub dirt off your skin?

1793
01:00:14,159 --> 01:00:17,075
Next is Han Na. Han Na, be bold.

1794
01:00:17,199 --> 01:00:19,698
Be bold. So Min was close.

1795
01:00:19,699 --> 01:00:21,515
(How is Han Na's "So Cool"?)

1796
01:00:24,610 --> 01:00:27,484
What's that? Why is she brushing her hair?

1797
01:00:27,710 --> 01:00:29,178
(He's almost crying.)

1798
01:00:29,179 --> 01:00:30,325
- Oh, gosh. - What is that?

1799
01:00:30,449 --> 01:00:31,785
(She washes her hair and spins.)

1800
01:00:32,349 --> 01:00:35,325
Who told her to do this? That's "Bruise" by Kim Hyun Jung.

1801
01:00:35,579 --> 01:00:37,589
(She keeps on showing off her hair regardless of what he says.)

1802
01:00:37,590 --> 01:00:40,819
She's here for the comedy.

1803
01:00:40,820 --> 01:00:43,988
She's being flimsy again.

1804
01:00:43,989 --> 01:00:44,988
(She doesn't care about winning at all.)

1805
01:00:44,989 --> 01:00:46,198
I can't do this.

1806
01:00:46,199 --> 01:00:48,698
Han Na.

1807
01:00:48,699 --> 01:00:50,499
Where is this dance from?

1808
01:00:50,500 --> 01:00:52,598
It's funnier because she looks so normal.

1809
01:00:52,599 --> 01:00:54,799
(A man carefully approaches the stage.)

1810
01:00:54,800 --> 01:00:56,138
She's the best.

1811
01:00:56,139 --> 01:00:57,509
She looks fine.

1812
01:00:57,510 --> 01:00:59,069
He's getting nervous.

1813
01:00:59,070 --> 01:01:01,038
(He's nervous all alone.)

1814
01:01:01,039 --> 01:01:02,509
- Seok Jin. - Are you going to do this?

1815
01:01:02,510 --> 01:01:03,779
Of course.

1816
01:01:03,780 --> 01:01:06,319
Of course. People invested in me.

1817
01:01:06,320 --> 01:01:08,018
Should we skip? Should we just keep going?

1818
01:01:08,019 --> 01:01:09,348
- I'm looking forward to this. - I have to dance.

1819
01:01:09,349 --> 01:01:11,419
Seok Jin, be bold if you can't dance.

1820
01:01:11,420 --> 01:01:13,118
- Okay. - Be energetic.

1821
01:01:13,119 --> 01:01:15,165
Seok Jin, be as sexy as possible.

1822
01:01:15,320 --> 01:01:16,689
(Be sexy?)

1823
01:01:16,690 --> 01:01:18,629
(Like this?)

1824
01:01:18,630 --> 01:01:20,698
(Rubbing)

1825
01:01:20,699 --> 01:01:22,328
Maybe it's actually this.

1826
01:01:22,329 --> 01:01:24,174
(You never know.)

1827
01:01:24,429 --> 01:01:26,069
(He expresses his sexiness for 1 percent possibility.)

1828
01:01:26,070 --> 01:01:28,698
I hate this.

1829
01:01:28,699 --> 01:01:30,515
(I'd rather not look.)

1830
01:01:31,139 --> 01:01:33,779
- Are you a fly? - Please stop it.

1831
01:01:33,780 --> 01:01:35,038
That's enough.

1832
01:01:35,039 --> 01:01:36,125
(Interrupting)

1833
01:01:36,849 --> 01:01:39,055
- That's it. - It's my turn.

1834
01:01:39,679 --> 01:01:41,448
Let's watch.

1835
01:01:41,449 --> 01:01:44,024
- She might not know. - Let's go.

1836
01:01:49,730 --> 01:01:50,805
What is this?

1837
01:01:51,989 --> 01:01:53,499
She's different.

1838
01:01:53,500 --> 01:01:54,734
This is the dance.

1839
01:01:54,760 --> 01:01:56,575
There was this move.

1840
01:01:57,000 --> 01:01:58,868
(Their eyes are on her.)

1841
01:01:58,869 --> 01:02:00,238
- This is right. - Is it?

1842
01:02:00,239 --> 01:02:02,344
- I remember. I recognize it. - It goes like this.

1843
01:02:03,809 --> 01:02:06,308
- She's right. - Good job.

1844
01:02:06,309 --> 01:02:08,085
(Her competitors feel defeated after seeing her sexy dance.)

1845
01:02:09,110 --> 01:02:10,408
(Her investor is super satisfied.)

1846
01:02:10,409 --> 01:02:11,808
Good job.

1847
01:02:11,809 --> 01:02:12,819
So Min got it right.

1848
01:02:12,820 --> 01:02:14,578
So Min was pretty close.

1849
01:02:14,579 --> 01:02:16,218
So Min, you were close. You never know.

1850
01:02:16,219 --> 01:02:19,089
It's possible that SISTAR will do the dance...

1851
01:02:19,090 --> 01:02:20,694
like Seok Jin on the video.

1852
01:02:20,789 --> 01:02:22,689
Like Seok Jin on the video.

1853
01:02:22,690 --> 01:02:25,189
You don't know yet.

1854
01:02:25,190 --> 01:02:26,299
(Is this it?)

1855
01:02:26,300 --> 01:02:28,558
YooA was good,

1856
01:02:28,559 --> 01:02:30,098
but her dances moves were wrong other than the "so cool" part.

1857
01:02:30,099 --> 01:02:31,229
- Was she? - Really?

1858
01:02:31,230 --> 01:02:34,214
(Original dance, YooA's dance)

1859
01:02:34,340 --> 01:02:36,968
We have to go with the energetic dance.

1860
01:02:36,969 --> 01:02:39,709
So Min was energetic. She even took it to the floor.

1861
01:02:39,710 --> 01:02:41,439
So Min was most energetic for this one.

1862
01:02:41,440 --> 01:02:42,509
It was So Min.

1863
01:02:42,510 --> 01:02:44,448
Look. My knees are red.

1864
01:02:44,449 --> 01:02:47,078
- So Min gets one point. - Yes!

1865
01:02:47,079 --> 01:02:49,395
(She got 1 precious point.)

1866
01:02:49,550 --> 01:02:51,395
- Good job, So Min. - Good job.

1867
01:02:51,820 --> 01:02:53,319
It's okay.

1868
01:02:53,320 --> 01:02:55,419
So Min, assign the order.

1869
01:02:55,420 --> 01:02:58,529
Seok Jin, YooA, me, and Han Na.

1870
01:02:58,530 --> 01:03:00,475
Play the music.

1871
01:03:01,429 --> 01:03:04,328
("Adult Ceremony" by Park Ji Yoon was everybody's favorite dance.)

1872
01:03:04,329 --> 01:03:05,444
Park Ji Yoon.

1873
01:03:05,769 --> 01:03:07,015
So Min is good at this.

1874
01:03:07,539 --> 01:03:09,868
(Many people did parodies of this dance.)

1875
01:03:09,869 --> 01:03:12,384
(What dance follows this part?)

1876
01:03:13,210 --> 01:03:15,078
(I know this!)

1877
01:03:15,079 --> 01:03:16,448
I know this.

1878
01:03:16,449 --> 01:03:19,484
(Everybody but Seok Jin knows the chorus. Here's the answer.)

1879
01:03:20,019 --> 01:03:22,118
(The answer)

1880
01:03:22,119 --> 01:03:27,589
(Bounce at the hips.)

1881
01:03:27,590 --> 01:03:32,265
(Push sideways like you're playing hard-to-get.)

1882
01:03:32,690 --> 01:03:34,875
(1st contestant freezes on the spot.)

1883
01:03:35,000 --> 01:03:36,105
This is hard.

1884
01:03:36,769 --> 01:03:38,875
Good job.

1885
01:03:39,000 --> 01:03:41,069
- Rub your hands. - That's exactly it.

1886
01:03:41,070 --> 01:03:42,875
Good job.

1887
01:03:43,570 --> 01:03:45,745
(They don't sound genuine at all.)

1888
01:03:46,210 --> 01:03:47,209
(Gosh, my eyes.)

1889
01:03:47,210 --> 01:03:48,609
Old man!

1890
01:03:48,610 --> 01:03:51,055
(He misbehaves in front of the guests.)

1891
01:03:51,710 --> 01:03:53,725
- Good job. That's exactly it. - Goodness.

1892
01:03:53,820 --> 01:03:54,819
Can I go?

1893
01:03:54,820 --> 01:03:57,218
This question...

1894
01:03:57,219 --> 01:03:58,819
is advantageous to So Min.

1895
01:03:58,820 --> 01:03:59,888
- Right? - Yes.

1896
01:03:59,889 --> 01:04:01,359
- I don't remember it entirely. - So Min.

1897
01:04:01,360 --> 01:04:02,518
Watch YooA.

1898
01:04:02,519 --> 01:04:04,259
- I think I know this. - I'll copy her.

1899
01:04:04,260 --> 01:04:06,058
- YooA's. - It's not that part.

1900
01:04:06,059 --> 01:04:07,899
Wait.

1901
01:04:07,900 --> 01:04:10,169
Seok Jin just finished. Give him a round of applause.

1902
01:04:10,170 --> 01:04:11,274
(Wait. Seok Jin just finished. Give him a round of applause.)

1903
01:04:12,099 --> 01:04:13,975
(Cheering)

1904
01:04:14,039 --> 01:04:15,499
Good shot!

1905
01:04:15,500 --> 01:04:16,714
You're going overboard.

1906
01:04:17,139 --> 01:04:18,245
You're the best.

1907
01:04:18,309 --> 01:04:20,314
I thought the camera was off.

1908
01:04:20,610 --> 01:04:22,754
Play the music.

1909
01:04:23,179 --> 01:04:26,085
(She was 6 at the time. Would she remember the song?)

1910
01:04:29,519 --> 01:04:31,118
She's right. This is the dance.

1911
01:04:31,119 --> 01:04:32,995
This is risky.

1912
01:04:33,159 --> 01:04:35,665
So Min, this isn't it. This part is right.

1913
01:04:36,989 --> 01:04:38,864
- This is right. - This is it.

1914
01:04:42,900 --> 01:04:44,205
She's good.

1915
01:04:44,599 --> 01:04:47,339
(It doesn't matter what's right. She already scored 100 percent.)

1916
01:04:47,340 --> 01:04:48,339
Awesome!

1917
01:04:48,340 --> 01:04:51,169
I don't think that was right, but she was good.

1918
01:04:51,170 --> 01:04:52,979
She made it look like it was the correct dance.

1919
01:04:52,980 --> 01:04:54,908
- She's good. - But...

1920
01:04:54,909 --> 01:04:56,709
- there was something more. - I don't remember.

1921
01:04:56,710 --> 01:04:57,779
I think So Min knows.

1922
01:04:57,780 --> 01:04:58,979
I don't remember everything though.

1923
01:04:58,980 --> 01:05:00,218
There's a good chance for So Min.

1924
01:05:00,219 --> 01:05:01,819
So Min, try to remember your days as a trainee.

1925
01:05:01,820 --> 01:05:03,089
I'm sure she knows.

1926
01:05:03,090 --> 01:05:04,995
I'm sure she does.

1927
01:05:09,789 --> 01:05:11,305
(Goodness!)

1928
01:05:12,690 --> 01:05:14,899
(This is it!)

1929
01:05:14,900 --> 01:05:16,375
(He's amazed.)

1930
01:05:16,570 --> 01:05:18,575
(She's copying the dance in her head.)

1931
01:05:19,469 --> 01:05:20,698
No, no.

1932
01:05:20,699 --> 01:05:22,768
- This part. - Now.

1933
01:05:22,769 --> 01:05:24,384
(She made a fatal mistake.)

1934
01:05:26,380 --> 01:05:28,085
Han Na said she knew for sure.

1935
01:05:28,610 --> 01:05:29,924
She's good.

1936
01:05:30,150 --> 01:05:31,685
So Min's good.

1937
01:05:31,710 --> 01:05:33,225
This is right.

1938
01:05:33,349 --> 01:05:34,825
- She's right. - This is right.

1939
01:05:35,349 --> 01:05:37,249
(Her body remembers the end.)

1940
01:05:37,250 --> 01:05:39,189
- She's right. - I was right.

1941
01:05:39,190 --> 01:05:40,718
- She was right. - She got it.

1942
01:05:40,719 --> 01:05:43,189
I hope Han Na takes this. Han Na.

1943
01:05:43,190 --> 01:05:45,189
- Han Na! - She said she knew.

1944
01:05:45,190 --> 01:05:47,029
I think I know a few more moves.

1945
01:05:47,030 --> 01:05:48,229
She learned this dance.

1946
01:05:48,230 --> 01:05:50,098
I didn't learn it,

1947
01:05:50,099 --> 01:05:51,499
but I know a few more moves.

1948
01:05:51,500 --> 01:05:53,774
- You know a few more? - Good luck, Han Na.

1949
01:05:54,170 --> 01:05:55,799
Let's start.

1950
01:05:55,800 --> 01:05:57,238
- Play... - I know this for sure.

1951
01:05:57,239 --> 01:05:58,344
the music.

1952
01:05:59,309 --> 01:06:00,714
I know this for sure.

1953
01:06:00,909 --> 01:06:02,884
- Bring your foot up. Correct. - She's good.

1954
01:06:03,280 --> 01:06:04,678
- She knows. - It's this part.

1955
01:06:04,679 --> 01:06:05,785
She knows.

1956
01:06:07,579 --> 01:06:08,725
This is it.

1957
01:06:08,780 --> 01:06:10,348
She's right.

1958
01:06:10,349 --> 01:06:11,665
This is it.

1959
01:06:11,889 --> 01:06:12,919
- What? - This is it.

1960
01:06:12,920 --> 01:06:14,259
I thought she almost fell.

1961
01:06:14,260 --> 01:06:16,189
- This is it. - She got it.

1962
01:06:16,190 --> 01:06:18,328
- The dance moves are correct. - She got it!

1963
01:06:18,329 --> 01:06:20,105
(They're excited.)

1964
01:06:20,530 --> 01:06:22,305
(This is it!)

1965
01:06:22,730 --> 01:06:23,768
- She got it. - She's so right.

1966
01:06:23,769 --> 01:06:25,029
She got it.

1967
01:06:25,030 --> 01:06:26,069
(She catches the body wave So Min missed.)

1968
01:06:26,070 --> 01:06:27,274
She's almost exact.

1969
01:06:27,739 --> 01:06:29,944
- She's right. - She's right.

1970
01:06:29,969 --> 01:06:31,214
This is it.

1971
01:06:31,510 --> 01:06:32,714
- You never know. - Yes!

1972
01:06:32,809 --> 01:06:33,879
Han Na wins.

1973
01:06:33,880 --> 01:06:35,254
(Han Na wins.)

1974
01:06:35,880 --> 01:06:38,285
(The flimsy dancer wins.)

1975
01:06:38,750 --> 01:06:41,319
Finally, something I know.

1976
01:06:41,320 --> 01:06:42,419
Oh, my.

1977
01:06:42,420 --> 01:06:43,589
- Good job, Han Na. - Something I know.

1978
01:06:43,590 --> 01:06:45,294
- It's now 1 to 1 to 1. - Was it okay?

1979
01:06:45,719 --> 01:06:47,535
This is a tight race.

1980
01:06:48,219 --> 01:06:49,959
- It's a tight race. - Seok Jin,

1981
01:06:49,960 --> 01:06:51,428
you never know.

1982
01:06:51,429 --> 01:06:53,064
Seok Jin, you never know.

1983
01:06:53,559 --> 01:06:55,129
- You never know. - Good luck, Seok Jin!

1984
01:06:55,130 --> 01:06:56,698
Good luck, Seok Jin!

1985
01:06:56,699 --> 01:06:57,999
- Good luck. - You didn't invest in me.

1986
01:06:58,000 --> 01:06:59,669
- You didn't invest in me. - Good luck.

1987
01:06:59,670 --> 01:07:00,799
Let's lift him.

1988
01:07:00,800 --> 01:07:01,799
This is so funny.

1989
01:07:01,800 --> 01:07:02,939
- Good luck! - Toss him up in the air.

1990
01:07:02,940 --> 01:07:05,609
Seok Jin!

1991
01:07:05,610 --> 01:07:07,908
- You didn't invest in me. - That's enough.

1992
01:07:07,909 --> 01:07:09,138
This is so funny.

1993
01:07:09,139 --> 01:07:10,209
You can do it, Seok Jin. Good luck.

1994
01:07:10,210 --> 01:07:11,779
The next song might be in your favor.

1995
01:07:11,780 --> 01:07:12,779
That's true.

1996
01:07:12,780 --> 01:07:14,879
- Han Na chooses this time. - They should do the final round.

1997
01:07:14,880 --> 01:07:16,118
- Han Na. - Final round for three of them.

1998
01:07:16,119 --> 01:07:17,319
We have to keep going.

1999
01:07:17,320 --> 01:07:18,448
It's tied at one.

2000
01:07:18,449 --> 01:07:20,718
It's 1 to 1 to 1, so you might win a point.

2001
01:07:20,719 --> 01:07:22,618
- Then... - I doubt it.

2002
01:07:22,619 --> 01:07:23,928
(He's serious.)

2003
01:07:23,929 --> 01:07:26,364
(That won't happen.)

2004
01:07:27,400 --> 01:07:29,558
Let's just go with the three of them.

2005
01:07:29,559 --> 01:07:30,868
- Come on. - I doubt it.

2006
01:07:30,869 --> 01:07:32,229
It's 1 to 1 to 1,

2007
01:07:32,230 --> 01:07:34,044
so you might win a point.

2008
01:07:35,300 --> 01:07:37,384
You never know.

2009
01:07:38,440 --> 01:07:40,585
It's difficult for me to stand there.

2010
01:07:41,079 --> 01:07:42,709
- You never know though. - It's really hard for me...

2011
01:07:42,710 --> 01:07:44,384
to stand here by myself.

2012
01:07:44,510 --> 01:07:47,294
I can't believe the staff included him in this.

2013
01:07:47,980 --> 01:07:48,979
They put me in here.

2014
01:07:48,980 --> 01:07:51,118
- He's worth tenfold. - These guys...

2015
01:07:51,119 --> 01:07:52,149
- They were trying to be funny. - How mean.

2016
01:07:52,150 --> 01:07:54,218
- Why did you put me here? - It's tenfold if he wins.

2017
01:07:54,219 --> 01:07:57,158
- How cruel. - It should be more like 50.

2018
01:07:57,159 --> 01:07:58,629
- This is too funny. - I can't stop laughing.

2019
01:07:58,630 --> 01:08:02,158
- I can't stop laughing. - This is an unusually tight race.

2020
01:08:02,159 --> 01:08:05,544
Let's start. Play the music.

2021
01:08:06,170 --> 01:08:08,538
("One More Time" by Jewelry was released in 2008.)

2022
01:08:08,539 --> 01:08:10,814
(Everyone knows the dance.)

2023
01:08:14,039 --> 01:08:16,448
- "Baby one more time." - That's it. Here it comes.

2024
01:08:16,449 --> 01:08:18,024
Seok Jin, you got this.

2025
01:08:19,880 --> 01:08:21,194
I don't know this dance.

2026
01:08:21,780 --> 01:08:22,848
What?

2027
01:08:22,849 --> 01:08:25,895
(He does the group dance from the fan-meet.)

2028
01:08:28,059 --> 01:08:29,294
What are you doing?

2029
01:08:29,360 --> 01:08:31,658
(Lia Kim, I am making good use of the dance I learned.)

2030
01:08:31,659 --> 01:08:32,835
Seok Jin.

2031
01:08:33,429 --> 01:08:34,674
What was that?

2032
01:08:35,260 --> 01:08:36,568
Stop.

2033
01:08:36,569 --> 01:08:39,028
(It's painful to watch the struggles of a grandpa dancer.)

2034
01:08:39,029 --> 01:08:40,339
I'm starting to forget this dance too.

2035
01:08:40,340 --> 01:08:41,499
(The group dance from the fan-meet)

2036
01:08:41,500 --> 01:08:42,715
I am forgetting the dance.

2037
01:08:42,869 --> 01:08:44,285
He is forgetting it.

2038
01:08:45,369 --> 01:08:46,408
Seok Jin.

2039
01:08:46,409 --> 01:08:47,679
Seriously.

2040
01:08:47,680 --> 01:08:51,085
When Seok Jin did this, he looked so shabby.

2041
01:08:51,350 --> 01:08:54,679
- No one helped him. - Stop it.

2042
01:08:54,680 --> 01:08:56,524
When he did this, his back looked so bent.

2043
01:08:58,449 --> 01:09:00,288
- Stop it. - That was hilarious.

2044
01:09:00,289 --> 01:09:01,919
- Who is next? - YooA, let's go.

2045
01:09:01,920 --> 01:09:03,228
Cheer for me.

2046
01:09:03,229 --> 01:09:05,759
It's a matter of whether or not YooA knows the dance.

2047
01:09:05,760 --> 01:09:06,904
Let's go.

2048
01:09:08,930 --> 01:09:10,604
(She knows the dance well!)

2049
01:09:11,899 --> 01:09:15,415
(YooA's dance makes them want to invest more coins.)

2050
01:09:16,300 --> 01:09:19,215
- That's it. - That's it.

2051
01:09:19,710 --> 01:09:20,915
Stay focused.

2052
01:09:21,510 --> 01:09:24,184
- That's it. - That's it.

2053
01:09:24,210 --> 01:09:25,755
- She knows the dance. - It's perfect.

2054
01:09:28,020 --> 01:09:29,749
(He always copies a cool dance move.)

2055
01:09:29,750 --> 01:09:30,788
All right.

2056
01:09:30,789 --> 01:09:32,125
- That was incredible. - All right.

2057
01:09:32,789 --> 01:09:34,658
- I studied everyone's dance. - You are good at copying the dance.

2058
01:09:34,659 --> 01:09:35,835
Okay.

2059
01:09:35,859 --> 01:09:38,228
With Han Na, you never know. She can copy...

2060
01:09:38,229 --> 01:09:40,934
- YooA's dance. - YooA did an amazing job.

2061
01:09:41,130 --> 01:09:42,474
Here comes Han Na's dance.

2062
01:09:42,529 --> 01:09:44,144
Han Na is scanning.

2063
01:09:44,770 --> 01:09:46,169
- Here it comes. - Let's go.

2064
01:09:46,170 --> 01:09:47,415
Let's go.

2065
01:09:49,600 --> 01:09:50,915
That's it!

2066
01:09:51,609 --> 01:09:52,908
What is that?

2067
01:09:52,909 --> 01:09:54,478
(After the nice intro,)

2068
01:09:54,479 --> 01:09:56,314
(she shows a sloppy dance.)

2069
01:09:58,010 --> 01:10:00,024
(Dance is all about moving to the beat.)

2070
01:10:01,220 --> 01:10:03,595
You are so courageous.

2071
01:10:03,819 --> 01:10:06,125
(Courage)

2072
01:10:06,989 --> 01:10:09,259
(Her courageous dance ensures that Kwang Soo will lose his coins.)

2073
01:10:09,260 --> 01:10:11,259
- You are so courageous. - You are so courageous.

2074
01:10:11,260 --> 01:10:12,604
You are so courageous.

2075
01:10:14,729 --> 01:10:16,459
(Her dance is more memorable than YooA's.)

2076
01:10:16,460 --> 01:10:18,974
- Her steps are quick. - She is incredible.

2077
01:10:19,470 --> 01:10:20,745
Han Na.

2078
01:10:21,170 --> 01:10:22,614
Han Na is incredible.

2079
01:10:23,640 --> 01:10:25,108
- I did it. - I acknowledge her talent.

2080
01:10:25,109 --> 01:10:27,585
All the songs were old, but YooA did splendidly.

2081
01:10:27,810 --> 01:10:29,509
The winner is YooA.

2082
01:10:29,510 --> 01:10:31,524
(There was unanimous consent.)

2083
01:10:31,909 --> 01:10:33,379
(The current score is 2 to 1 to 1 to 0.)

2084
01:10:33,380 --> 01:10:35,549
- She deserves the victory. - Her dances were spot on.

2085
01:10:35,550 --> 01:10:36,618
Is it over?

2086
01:10:36,619 --> 01:10:38,364
- One song remains. - Aren't we done?

2087
01:10:38,590 --> 01:10:40,734
- Aren't we done? - Okay. Seok Jin, you never know.

2088
01:10:41,590 --> 01:10:43,019
Try your best until the end.

2089
01:10:43,020 --> 01:10:44,559
(The match starts now.)

2090
01:10:44,560 --> 01:10:45,959
Try your best until the end.

2091
01:10:45,960 --> 01:10:47,929
Don't give up like you did earlier.

2092
01:10:47,930 --> 01:10:50,068
- Did I upset you somehow, Chul Min? - Seok Jin.

2093
01:10:50,069 --> 01:10:51,505
- Why did you put me in this group? - You never know.

2094
01:10:51,630 --> 01:10:53,245
Why? Mi Yeon.

2095
01:10:53,300 --> 01:10:55,469
Why did you put me in this group? This is so stressful.

2096
01:10:55,470 --> 01:10:56,614
It's time to turn the tables.

2097
01:10:56,869 --> 01:10:58,014
It's time to turn the tables.

2098
01:10:58,069 --> 01:11:00,238
Seok Jin, there are people who bet on you.

2099
01:11:00,239 --> 01:11:01,354
Seok Jin, let's go!

2100
01:11:01,409 --> 01:11:02,908
I get it,

2101
01:11:02,909 --> 01:11:04,408
but why are you saying "You never know"?

2102
01:11:04,409 --> 01:11:06,179
(But why are you saying "You never know"?)

2103
01:11:06,180 --> 01:11:07,519
- You never know. - Do you take me for a fool?

2104
01:11:07,520 --> 01:11:08,849
- You never know. - Don't give up.

2105
01:11:08,850 --> 01:11:10,295
- You never know. - The game isn't over.

2106
01:11:10,319 --> 01:11:12,349
Do you want me to believe you and dance diligently?

2107
01:11:12,350 --> 01:11:13,589
- The game isn't over. - You are right!

2108
01:11:13,590 --> 01:11:15,059
- The game isn't over. - That's right.

2109
01:11:15,060 --> 01:11:16,419
- I... - You can do it.

2110
01:11:16,420 --> 01:11:18,205
- Do your best until the end. - You can do it.

2111
01:11:19,060 --> 01:11:20,375
My stomach hurts from laughing.

2112
01:11:20,800 --> 01:11:23,028
- My stomach hurts so much. - Let's begin.

2113
01:11:23,029 --> 01:11:24,474
(What could be the last question?)

2114
01:11:25,369 --> 01:11:27,698
("SOLO" by Jennie is a song that was released in 2018.)

2115
01:11:27,699 --> 01:11:30,038
(It has only been a year since its release.)

2116
01:11:30,039 --> 01:11:33,755
(Will Han Na be able to survive with "SOLO"?)

2117
01:11:36,380 --> 01:11:37,478
She seems to know the dance.

2118
01:11:37,479 --> 01:11:39,955
- She knows the dance. - She seems to know the dance.

2119
01:11:40,020 --> 01:11:42,394
(Han Na has the signature dance move down.)

2120
01:11:42,579 --> 01:11:44,219
(How will her version of "SOLO" be?)

2121
01:11:44,220 --> 01:11:45,325
She knows the dance.

2122
01:11:47,859 --> 01:11:49,035
What is that?

2123
01:11:49,289 --> 01:11:50,688
- Hey. - What are you doing?

2124
01:11:50,689 --> 01:11:52,205
(Her solo dance is explosive.)

2125
01:11:52,359 --> 01:11:53,575
That's a different type of the solo dance.

2126
01:11:53,960 --> 01:11:55,328
That's a different type of the solo dance.

2127
01:11:55,329 --> 01:11:56,328
(She welcomes new love.)

2128
01:11:56,329 --> 01:11:58,299
- A solo dance. - That's not the right dance.

2129
01:11:58,300 --> 01:11:59,629
A solo dance.

2130
01:11:59,630 --> 01:12:02,014
(The dance suits "SOLO" perfectly.)

2131
01:12:02,239 --> 01:12:03,444
"I am solo."

2132
01:12:03,840 --> 01:12:05,839
Her dance suits the song.

2133
01:12:05,840 --> 01:12:07,408
- It was a solo dance. - A solo dance.

2134
01:12:07,409 --> 01:12:08,639
- It was a solo dance. - That's right.

2135
01:12:08,640 --> 01:12:10,325
- A solo dance. - Good job.

2136
01:12:10,350 --> 01:12:11,749
I don't know the dance very well.

2137
01:12:11,750 --> 01:12:12,849
I don't know the dance at all.

2138
01:12:12,850 --> 01:12:15,224
- Shall I play a different song? - Yes.

2139
01:12:15,619 --> 01:12:17,318
It was really strange...

2140
01:12:17,319 --> 01:12:19,389
because Seok Jin practiced the dance in the back.

2141
01:12:19,390 --> 01:12:21,465
(He did it while Han Na was dancing.)

2142
01:12:21,989 --> 01:12:24,889
(You never know!)

2143
01:12:24,890 --> 01:12:26,734
- Hey. - He hasn't given up.

2144
01:12:26,800 --> 01:12:29,129
- It's not over yet. - Seok Jin put his hand...

2145
01:12:29,130 --> 01:12:30,274
in the pocket.

2146
01:12:31,430 --> 01:12:33,774
- He practiced with seriousness. - I know.

2147
01:12:34,300 --> 01:12:36,144
- I was so surprised. - Seok Jin.

2148
01:12:36,170 --> 01:12:37,669
You never know.

2149
01:12:37,670 --> 01:12:39,839
That's right.

2150
01:12:39,840 --> 01:12:41,078
"You never know."

2151
01:12:41,079 --> 01:12:42,679
(You never know.)

2152
01:12:42,680 --> 01:12:45,285
- This is for you. - "You never know."

2153
01:12:45,979 --> 01:12:47,318
- "You never know." - "You never know."

2154
01:12:47,319 --> 01:12:49,019
Come here.

2155
01:12:49,020 --> 01:12:50,448
(Messages of support pour in.)

2156
01:12:50,449 --> 01:12:52,148
- Come here. - I believe in you!

2157
01:12:52,149 --> 01:12:53,795
- You never know. - Come here.

2158
01:12:54,159 --> 01:12:55,459
- You need to be scolded. - You never know.

2159
01:12:55,460 --> 01:12:56,589
You never know.

2160
01:12:56,590 --> 01:12:58,135
You must think I am a fool.

2161
01:12:58,930 --> 01:13:00,505
- That was funny. - That was funny.

2162
01:13:01,460 --> 01:13:03,328
Let's move on to the next song.

2163
01:13:03,329 --> 01:13:04,575
Here it comes.

2164
01:13:04,600 --> 01:13:05,705
Play.

2165
01:13:07,640 --> 01:13:09,898
("Bubble Pop" by HyunA was released in 2011.)

2166
01:13:09,899 --> 01:13:12,215
(The signature dance move involves rapid hip movements.)

2167
01:13:16,609 --> 01:13:17,955
- "Bubble Pop." - This is good.

2168
01:13:17,979 --> 01:13:19,148
Here it comes.

2169
01:13:19,149 --> 01:13:20,549
(YooA gets started on the "Bubble Pop" dance.)

2170
01:13:20,550 --> 01:13:23,595
(YooA would know a song by her senior singer.)

2171
01:13:24,220 --> 01:13:26,148
(The dance comes right away.)

2172
01:13:26,149 --> 01:13:28,795
(The answer for "Bubble pop" will be revealed.)

2173
01:13:28,960 --> 01:13:35,759
(The answer)

2174
01:13:35,760 --> 01:13:39,144
(1. Blow a kiss. 2. Bend the back continuously.)

2175
01:13:40,600 --> 01:13:43,114
(She starts off perfectly.)

2176
01:13:44,439 --> 01:13:45,839
So Min, watch carefully.

2177
01:13:45,840 --> 01:13:46,879
Remember each dance move.

2178
01:13:46,880 --> 01:13:48,209
Gosh, she is good.

2179
01:13:48,210 --> 01:13:51,184
(YooA remembers each detail.)

2180
01:13:51,909 --> 01:13:53,854
- She is really good. - She is good.

2181
01:13:56,619 --> 01:13:58,795
(She ends every dance with her own charms.)

2182
01:13:58,920 --> 01:14:01,035
Her movements are so light.

2183
01:14:01,060 --> 01:14:03,165
To be honest, we don't know if the dance is right.

2184
01:14:03,590 --> 01:14:06,635
- But we can tell she is good. - She exudes confidence.

2185
01:14:06,930 --> 01:14:09,335
Let's go. Play the song.

2186
01:14:09,460 --> 01:14:10,675
So Min, shake your hips.

2187
01:14:12,569 --> 01:14:14,614
(Creaking)

2188
01:14:14,699 --> 01:14:16,139
That's good. Keep going.

2189
01:14:16,140 --> 01:14:18,144
- The dance didn't go that way. - No.

2190
01:14:18,710 --> 01:14:19,814
Shake your hips.

2191
01:14:21,010 --> 01:14:22,354
Keep going until the end.

2192
01:14:23,140 --> 01:14:25,085
- Keep going. - Hang in there.

2193
01:14:25,109 --> 01:14:26,455
Go to Se Chan.

2194
01:14:28,720 --> 01:14:30,325
(I am here.)

2195
01:14:30,449 --> 01:14:33,425
(Knowing that she won't win, she focuses on building love.)

2196
01:14:36,829 --> 01:14:37,929
She is good.

2197
01:14:37,930 --> 01:14:39,104
- This is embarrassing. - She is good.

2198
01:14:39,390 --> 01:14:41,135
She decided to find love instead.

2199
01:14:41,329 --> 01:14:42,828
- Good job. - That was hilarious.

2200
01:14:42,829 --> 01:14:43,969
- Good job. - That was hilarious.

2201
01:14:43,970 --> 01:14:45,705
I will sit out on this one, so Han Na can go next.

2202
01:14:46,000 --> 01:14:47,868
- You should dance, Seok Jin. - No.

2203
01:14:47,869 --> 01:14:49,575
You never know.

2204
01:14:50,069 --> 01:14:51,885
Listen. You...

2205
01:14:52,239 --> 01:14:53,955
It's not over until it is!

2206
01:14:54,279 --> 01:14:55,614
- You can do it! - You can do it!

2207
01:14:55,939 --> 01:14:58,024
- You never know. - You never know, my foot.

2208
01:14:58,079 --> 01:14:59,509
You don't know how it feels to stand here alone.

2209
01:14:59,510 --> 01:15:00,618
There are children...

2210
01:15:00,619 --> 01:15:02,955
- who see you and dream. - Hey.

2211
01:15:03,020 --> 01:15:04,288
I am standing here...

2212
01:15:04,289 --> 01:15:05,625
and the song is "Bubble Pop."

2213
01:15:06,149 --> 01:15:07,234
Seok Jin.

2214
01:15:07,920 --> 01:15:12,089
(At the age of 54, he is competing against a 24-year-old idol singer.)

2215
01:15:12,090 --> 01:15:13,675
I...

2216
01:15:14,199 --> 01:15:16,205
Try to understand where I am coming from.

2217
01:15:16,659 --> 01:15:18,675
How am I supposed to dance here?

2218
01:15:18,770 --> 01:15:20,614
Bubble, bubble... I can't do that.

2219
01:15:21,300 --> 01:15:23,139
I will leave "Bubble Pop" to you.

2220
01:15:23,140 --> 01:15:24,568
My stomach hurts.

2221
01:15:24,569 --> 01:15:25,969
- We understand. - My goodness,

2222
01:15:25,970 --> 01:15:27,938
- Please understand. - We understand.

2223
01:15:27,939 --> 01:15:29,209
(His heart is at ease now.)

2224
01:15:29,210 --> 01:15:30,785
- We understand. - It's Han Na's turn.

2225
01:15:31,479 --> 01:15:33,379
How will I do the signature dance move?

2226
01:15:33,380 --> 01:15:35,978
Han Na, the signature dance move could suit you better.

2227
01:15:35,979 --> 01:15:37,818
Do it in your style.

2228
01:15:37,819 --> 01:15:39,894
(The outcome depends on Han Na's dance.)

2229
01:15:41,520 --> 01:15:42,919
(She gets the hand gesture right.)

2230
01:15:42,920 --> 01:15:44,564
Han Na knows the dance.

2231
01:15:44,859 --> 01:15:46,404
Han Na knows the dance.

2232
01:15:46,899 --> 01:15:47,929
(Her speed is on another level.)

2233
01:15:47,930 --> 01:15:49,274
She is fast.

2234
01:15:50,270 --> 01:15:53,104
(The part she knows ends and she begins to dance sloppily.)

2235
01:15:54,369 --> 01:15:57,245
(Kwang Soo will lose the coins he invested.)

2236
01:15:57,609 --> 01:15:58,669
(Carefree)

2237
01:15:58,670 --> 01:15:59,738
This is hilarious.

2238
01:15:59,739 --> 01:16:01,578
- Her facial expression is funny. - You are the best.

2239
01:16:01,579 --> 01:16:02,854
Her facial expression is funny.

2240
01:16:02,979 --> 01:16:05,285
Han Na, move sideways.

2241
01:16:06,210 --> 01:16:08,625
(She appeases her fans.)

2242
01:16:08,819 --> 01:16:10,818
(Even though she lost, she fought well.)

2243
01:16:10,819 --> 01:16:12,788
- Han Na is hilarious. - I love this dance move.

2244
01:16:12,789 --> 01:16:13,889
- Moving sideways. - I love this dance move.

2245
01:16:13,890 --> 01:16:16,064
The Charlie Chaplin Dance.

2246
01:16:16,659 --> 01:16:18,158
I laughed so much today.

2247
01:16:18,159 --> 01:16:19,635
Thus,

2248
01:16:20,029 --> 01:16:21,675
the winner of this round is...

2249
01:16:21,899 --> 01:16:22,929
YooA.

2250
01:16:22,930 --> 01:16:24,528
(YooA wins the round again.)

2251
01:16:24,529 --> 01:16:26,299
(With 3 points, YooA becomes the final winner.)

2252
01:16:26,300 --> 01:16:27,299
It's as expected.

2253
01:16:27,300 --> 01:16:28,599
YooA, good job.

2254
01:16:28,600 --> 01:16:29,969
- It's over. - I knew you would win.

2255
01:16:29,970 --> 01:16:31,509
I acknowledge her talent.

2256
01:16:31,510 --> 01:16:32,908
They couldn't win against her.

2257
01:16:32,909 --> 01:16:34,179
But they fought well.

2258
01:16:34,180 --> 01:16:35,955
- I am glad. - They couldn't win against her.

2259
01:16:36,010 --> 01:16:39,078
- I knew this would happen. - Everyone did a good job.

2260
01:16:39,079 --> 01:16:40,595
- It was a fierce match. - Everyone is a winner.

2261
01:16:41,350 --> 01:16:42,948
The rankings have completely changed.

2262
01:16:42,949 --> 01:16:44,465
- Really? - Really?

2263
01:16:44,590 --> 01:16:46,795
This is a disaster. I bet a lot of coins.

2264
01:16:46,989 --> 01:16:48,234
Me too.

2265
01:16:48,420 --> 01:16:49,988
I will announce the one who is in first place.

2266
01:16:49,989 --> 01:16:51,259
(1st place)

2267
01:16:51,260 --> 01:16:53,158
With this round, the one who is in first place is...

2268
01:16:53,159 --> 01:16:55,398
(Who invested wisely and succeeded to rise to the top?)

2269
01:16:55,399 --> 01:16:57,169
Byung Jae with 52 coins.

2270
01:16:57,170 --> 01:16:58,469
(Byung Jae is in 1st place with 52 coins.)

2271
01:16:58,470 --> 01:16:59,528
52 coins?

2272
01:16:59,529 --> 01:17:00,969
(Byung Jae is in 1st place with 52 coins.)

2273
01:17:00,970 --> 01:17:02,845
- 52 coins? - Did you bet all the coins?

2274
01:17:02,899 --> 01:17:05,814
- No, no. - He bet many coins on YooA.

2275
01:17:05,909 --> 01:17:07,585
- Good job, Byung Jae. - It was a winning move.

2276
01:17:07,640 --> 01:17:11,224
Seok Jin used to be at the bottom with four coins.

2277
01:17:11,649 --> 01:17:13,408
Now, the one at the bottom is...

2278
01:17:13,409 --> 01:17:14,919
(Did the one at the bottom change?)

2279
01:17:14,920 --> 01:17:16,795
Now, the one at the bottom is...

2280
01:17:18,720 --> 01:17:19,995
Now, the one at the bottom is...

2281
01:17:20,090 --> 01:17:21,519
Hee Jin with zero coins.

2282
01:17:21,520 --> 01:17:23,734
Zero coins? Did I hear that right?

2283
01:17:24,689 --> 01:17:26,328
(Screaming)

2284
01:17:26,329 --> 01:17:28,228
(How is that possible?)

2285
01:17:28,229 --> 01:17:30,429
- 0 coins? - 0 coins?

2286
01:17:30,430 --> 01:17:32,169
- My goodness. - She went all in.

2287
01:17:32,170 --> 01:17:33,368
She bet all of her coins on So Min.

2288
01:17:33,369 --> 01:17:34,669
- She bet all of her coins on me. - So Min.

2289
01:17:34,670 --> 01:17:35,769
(Hee Jin bet all of her coins on So Min.)

2290
01:17:35,770 --> 01:17:38,269
Either Seok Jin or So Min.

2291
01:17:38,270 --> 01:17:39,345
(She didn't have a clue.)

2292
01:17:39,939 --> 01:17:41,009
I will bet all of my coins on So Min.

2293
01:17:41,010 --> 01:17:42,455
(She bet all of her coins on So Min.)

2294
01:17:43,010 --> 01:17:45,108
Let's move to the location of the penalty.

2295
01:17:45,109 --> 01:17:47,818
(Don't put all your eggs in one basket.)

2296
01:17:47,819 --> 01:17:50,118
Today, only one person will receive the penalty.

2297
01:17:50,119 --> 01:17:51,325
Everyone,

2298
01:17:51,750 --> 01:17:53,019
we are done.

2299
01:17:53,020 --> 01:17:54,165
Byung Jae, take the ring.

2300
01:17:54,890 --> 01:17:56,019
Byung Jae.

2301
01:17:56,020 --> 01:17:58,089
- I haven't seen it in a while. - Today,

2302
01:17:58,090 --> 01:17:59,488
Han Na,

2303
01:17:59,489 --> 01:18:01,205
- YooA, - It's real gold.

2304
01:18:01,260 --> 01:18:03,769
Byung Jae, and Hee Jin worked really hard.

2305
01:18:03,770 --> 01:18:05,005
That's right.

2306
01:18:05,199 --> 01:18:06,769
- Hee Jin. - Yes?

2307
01:18:06,770 --> 01:18:08,469
- Get in position. - My goodness.

2308
01:18:08,470 --> 01:18:10,169
(Go for the penalty.)

2309
01:18:10,170 --> 01:18:11,438
- Get ready. - Get ready.

2310
01:18:11,439 --> 01:18:13,038
- This way. - Stand wherever you want.

2311
01:18:13,039 --> 01:18:15,478
Everybody, please count to three,

2312
01:18:15,479 --> 01:18:17,049
and the water bomb will be released.

2313
01:18:17,050 --> 01:18:18,849
One,

2314
01:18:18,850 --> 01:18:19,978
two,

2315
01:18:19,979 --> 01:18:21,125
three.

2316
01:18:21,619 --> 01:18:23,889
(We wish her the best of luck...)

2317
01:18:23,890 --> 01:18:24,919
(like the explosive water bomb.)

2318
01:18:24,920 --> 01:18:26,118
Come here.

2319
01:18:26,119 --> 01:18:28,118
(We wish her the best of luck like the explosive water bomb.)

2320
01:18:28,119 --> 01:18:29,389
Come here.

2321
01:18:29,390 --> 01:18:31,788
(We would like to thank Hee Jin, Han Na, YooA of OH MY GIRL,)

2322
01:18:31,789 --> 01:18:33,658
(and Byung Jae for joining us on a cold day.)

2323
01:18:33,659 --> 01:18:35,934
She's in danger.

2324
01:18:37,670 --> 01:18:40,075
(It all started on the sea train to Incheon.)

2325
01:18:40,470 --> 01:18:42,944
(People start shrieking and behaving strangely on the train.)

2326
01:18:43,739 --> 01:18:46,509
(There are zombies, and their lives are at danger.)

2327
01:18:46,510 --> 01:18:49,184
(The train is locked. They must act with reason.)

2328
01:18:50,180 --> 01:18:52,684
(The survival aces gather for an unprecedented incident.)

2329
01:18:53,079 --> 01:18:54,925
(Chanmi says she doesn't want to lose.)

2330
01:18:55,079 --> 01:18:56,354
(They have to pull themselves together to survive.)

2331
01:18:56,949 --> 01:18:58,625
(Hyejeong says she can't beat this.)

2332
01:18:59,050 --> 01:19:01,064
(One touch determines who survives.)

2333
01:19:01,319 --> 01:19:03,035
(Seolhyun says she's within the territory.)

2334
01:19:03,619 --> 01:19:05,835
(Safety zone closes in on them.)

2335
01:19:06,159 --> 01:19:08,434
(Yuna says she has to find a box.)

2336
01:19:08,859 --> 01:19:10,745
(Are there mysterious boxes hidden in the disaster zone?)

2337
01:19:11,229 --> 01:19:13,005
(Jimin says she has to rip the name tags.)

2338
01:19:13,270 --> 01:19:14,599
(As soon as they let their guard down,)

2339
01:19:14,600 --> 01:19:15,938
(the humans collapse.)

2340
01:19:15,939 --> 01:19:18,245
(To Incheon: Catch Me)
