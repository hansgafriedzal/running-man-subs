1
00:00:07,269 --> 00:00:08,898
(Last week)

2
00:00:10,138 --> 00:00:13,708
(Grand New Year Project, the Level Up Race)

3
00:00:13,708 --> 00:00:16,679
(When a member reaches Level 10, it's a win, and the project ends.)

4
00:00:16,679 --> 00:00:17,778
(To reach the highest level,)

5
00:00:17,778 --> 00:00:20,348
(the cutthroat race has begun.)

6
00:00:20,690 --> 00:00:24,289
(When it comes to leveling up, there are no foes or colleagues.)

7
00:00:24,289 --> 00:00:27,859
(The disloyal members chose betrayal and leveled up.)

8
00:00:27,859 --> 00:00:29,800
(The disparity between the levels is increasing.)

9
00:00:29,800 --> 00:00:33,000
(What is at the end of this race?)

10
00:00:36,520 --> 00:00:39,630
(At a cafe in Ilsan, Gyeonggi Province)

11
00:00:39,655 --> 00:00:42,285
- Hello. - Hey, there.

12
00:00:42,430 --> 00:00:43,730
Hello.

13
00:00:43,730 --> 00:00:45,659
- You're wearing playful glasses. - Hi.

14
00:00:45,659 --> 00:00:47,300
- How playful will you be today? - Hey.

15
00:00:47,300 --> 00:00:48,669
Gosh, he's wearing playful glasses.

16
00:00:48,669 --> 00:00:50,769
Jae Seok wears that pair when he's in the best mood.

17
00:00:50,769 --> 00:00:53,439
- I wonder how playful he'll be. - Those playful glasses.

18
00:00:54,009 --> 00:00:55,610
(Turning into a mischievous guy)

19
00:00:55,610 --> 00:00:56,680
Yu Jun Sang.

20
00:00:57,680 --> 00:01:00,650
(Look at his outfit. It's Jun Sang's outfit from "Winter Sonata".)

21
00:01:01,250 --> 00:01:03,720
From "Winter Sonata". Yu Jun Sang.

22
00:01:03,720 --> 00:01:05,720
(He looks older than Jun Sang.)

23
00:01:05,720 --> 00:01:07,389
(We apologize to Bae Yong Joon.)

24
00:01:07,590 --> 00:01:09,920
- It's from "Winter Sonata". - Why are you laughing?

25
00:01:10,159 --> 00:01:12,259
- It's from "Winter Sonata". - Why are you laughing?

26
00:01:12,589 --> 00:01:13,930
- Laugh when you can relate. - Hey.

27
00:01:13,930 --> 00:01:16,299
- I knew the outfit looked familiar. - That's so funny.

28
00:01:16,430 --> 00:01:18,259
- The outfit does look similar. - You're Mr. Big Nose.

29
00:01:18,259 --> 00:01:20,829
Today, it'll be Part Three of the Level Up Race.

30
00:01:21,199 --> 00:01:23,140
It's Level Fabrication Incident.

31
00:01:23,140 --> 00:01:24,769
(Level Fabrication Incident)

32
00:01:24,769 --> 00:01:27,040
- What's this now? - Level Fabrication Incident?

33
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:28,439
(The levels were fabricated?)

34
00:01:28,970 --> 00:01:32,879
(Before the filming, they took their level badges.)

35
00:01:32,879 --> 00:01:36,619
(Among these, some levels were fabricated?)

36
00:01:37,119 --> 00:01:38,449
(What on earth is happening?)

37
00:01:38,449 --> 00:01:40,820
- Did someone steal it? - The levels were fabricated?

38
00:01:41,190 --> 00:01:44,089
Three of your level badges...

39
00:01:44,089 --> 00:01:46,990
had been stolen and fabricated then.

40
00:01:47,359 --> 00:01:49,259
- They were fabricated? - Did someone steal them?

41
00:01:49,259 --> 00:01:50,999
(Then the culprit is...)

42
00:01:50,999 --> 00:01:52,130
Gosh, come on.

43
00:01:52,499 --> 00:01:54,199
(Without asking any questions, he goes to Kwang Soo.)

44
00:01:54,199 --> 00:01:57,070
I'm sick of this. It wasn't me!

45
00:01:57,070 --> 00:01:59,169
- Because of Jae Seok... - Jae Seok could be the culprit.

46
00:01:59,169 --> 00:02:00,910
Yes, he might be the culprit on the contrary.

47
00:02:00,910 --> 00:02:04,609
- Two members stole the levels. - Really?

48
00:02:04,809 --> 00:02:08,910
And there is one more forger who helped the thieves fabricate.

49
00:02:08,910 --> 00:02:12,050
I'll present five suspects including the forger.

50
00:02:12,050 --> 00:02:13,050
What?

51
00:02:13,050 --> 00:02:15,290
(5 suspects including the forger are revealed.)

52
00:02:15,290 --> 00:02:16,759
There are five suspects?

53
00:02:17,089 --> 00:02:18,919
Five suspects including the forger?

54
00:02:19,089 --> 00:02:20,460
- There are five? - What?

55
00:02:20,460 --> 00:02:22,290
(Someone among these 5 guests is a forger.)

56
00:02:22,290 --> 00:02:24,199
(Who is it?)

57
00:02:24,699 --> 00:02:26,699
- It's Lee Dong Hwi. - Hey, Lee Dong Hwi.

58
00:02:27,199 --> 00:02:29,400
- Hello. - My gosh.

59
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:30,469
(5 guests with an unusual presence)

60
00:02:30,699 --> 00:02:32,339
(5 suspects for forging the levels: Gong Myoung, Jin Sun Kyu,)

61
00:02:32,339 --> 00:02:33,969
(Lee Ha Nee, Lee Dong Hwi and Ryu Seung Ryong)

62
00:02:33,969 --> 00:02:35,339
My gosh, Ha Nee.

63
00:02:35,339 --> 00:02:37,240
(Is this really happening? It's the best list of suspects.)

64
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:39,479
- My goodness. - Hello.

65
00:02:39,479 --> 00:02:41,779
- Hey, Seung Ryong. - The whole cast rarely comes.

66
00:02:41,779 --> 00:02:45,279
My gosh, Seung Ryong. Usually, only 2 or 3 guests join us.

67
00:02:45,279 --> 00:02:47,390
All five of them are joining us today.

68
00:02:47,390 --> 00:02:49,289
(They came to rule the variety show as well as the movie industry.)

69
00:02:49,490 --> 00:02:52,890
If I'm not mistaken, all of these guests have...

70
00:02:52,890 --> 00:02:54,529
- never starred on our show before. - Is this your first time?

71
00:02:54,529 --> 00:02:55,900
- It's everyone's first time? - Yes.

72
00:02:55,900 --> 00:02:57,499
- Yes, it's my 1st time. - Ha Nee, this is your 1st time...

73
00:02:57,499 --> 00:02:58,800
- as well. - It's my first time.

74
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:00,400
As for Seung Ryong, isn't this...

75
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:02,029
- your first variety show? - Right.

76
00:03:02,099 --> 00:03:04,369
- Yes, it's my 1st time. - Isn't this your 1st variety show?

77
00:03:04,369 --> 00:03:05,869
- The 1st variety show? - The 1st variety show?

78
00:03:05,869 --> 00:03:07,770
- It's an honor. - Seriously?

79
00:03:07,770 --> 00:03:10,879
I'd like to ask you to introduce yourselves one at a time.

80
00:03:10,879 --> 00:03:13,409
I was really surprised to see him here.

81
00:03:13,409 --> 00:03:16,450
Well, okay. I'm Ryu Seung Ryong.

82
00:03:16,819 --> 00:03:18,249
Gosh, I'm a big fan.

83
00:03:19,249 --> 00:03:21,249
(As for this suspect,)

84
00:03:21,249 --> 00:03:25,689
(he's the best actor who can pull off any role or any genre.)

85
00:03:25,689 --> 00:03:28,490
(He reached the highest level in the movie industry.)

86
00:03:29,089 --> 00:03:31,800
(Ryu Seung Ryong, a mega-hit actor with 1,000 faces)

87
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:35,369
(Feeling awkward)

88
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:37,069
(A diehard fan intrudes.)

89
00:03:37,069 --> 00:03:38,069
Hey.

90
00:03:38,069 --> 00:03:40,539
Hey, you're not supposed to make these stars uncomfortable.

91
00:03:40,539 --> 00:03:43,240
Tell you what. You are all my close colleagues.

92
00:03:43,279 --> 00:03:45,409
If you make them uncomfortable, I won't let that slide.

93
00:03:45,539 --> 00:03:47,379
- I'm a fan. - Anyway,

94
00:03:47,379 --> 00:03:49,580
I consider him as almost my real brother.

95
00:03:49,580 --> 00:03:51,520
- How many brothers do you have? - That's enough.

96
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:53,450
(How many brothers do you have?)

97
00:03:53,689 --> 00:03:55,289
- He's your brother? - He has a lot of brothers.

98
00:03:55,289 --> 00:03:58,189
- He's like my cousin. - You always change the family tree.

99
00:03:58,189 --> 00:04:01,390
It's your first official appearance on a variety show after your debut.

100
00:04:01,390 --> 00:04:02,700
- Officially, it is. - Yes.

101
00:04:02,700 --> 00:04:04,260
Were you nervous yesterday?

102
00:04:04,260 --> 00:04:05,999
- Gosh, I didn't get any sleep. - Really?

103
00:04:05,999 --> 00:04:09,700
I have two sons, and this has been their wish too.

104
00:04:09,700 --> 00:04:12,140
He's been talking about our show for a long time now.

105
00:04:12,140 --> 00:04:14,339
- How old is your eldest son? - He'll be in eighth grade now.

106
00:04:15,409 --> 00:04:18,039
To them, we are like their heroes.

107
00:04:18,339 --> 00:04:22,150
(Brimming with confidence for no reason)

108
00:04:22,279 --> 00:04:24,920
- Stop it. What's wrong with you? - Gosh, Seok Jin.

109
00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:27,349
- You're embarrassing me. - Stop it.

110
00:04:27,390 --> 00:04:29,890
- Hello. Hi. Nice to meet you. - What's gotten into him?

111
00:04:30,260 --> 00:04:33,159
- Come on. Exactly. - You're no hero to them.

112
00:04:33,289 --> 00:04:34,890
- I'm sorry. - Seriously.

113
00:04:34,930 --> 00:04:38,430
By the way, we came across an unexpected nickname.

114
00:04:38,430 --> 00:04:40,629
Your nickname in your 20s was Psycho.

115
00:04:40,629 --> 00:04:42,200
(His nickname in his 20s was Psycho.)

116
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:43,869
(His nickname was Psycho?)

117
00:04:43,869 --> 00:04:45,869
- Why is that? - Do you remember this?

118
00:04:45,969 --> 00:04:47,740
I wanted to be different.

119
00:04:47,770 --> 00:04:49,710
- Like the off-the-wall type? - Yes, off-the-wall.

120
00:04:49,710 --> 00:04:52,279
- I had a lot of stuff inside. - You couldn't express it.

121
00:04:52,279 --> 00:04:53,650
- I couldn't express it. - I see.

122
00:04:53,650 --> 00:04:57,620
That's why I used to carry around a big box of matches.

123
00:04:58,479 --> 00:04:59,820
- Yes, there was this huge box. - I see. That box?

124
00:05:00,690 --> 00:05:02,659
- It was huge. Restaurants had them. - I see. That?

125
00:05:02,659 --> 00:05:05,489
- I know what it is. - I carried an alarm clock too.

126
00:05:05,489 --> 00:05:06,929
I showed that to people when they asked for time.

127
00:05:06,929 --> 00:05:10,200
- So he didn't wear watches. - He carried around a big clock.

128
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:12,700
- Your daily life was like a skit. - He had an alarm clock.

129
00:05:12,700 --> 00:05:14,969
You had long hair because of the nanta show.

130
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:16,969
- His hair was this long. - Up to his shoulders?

131
00:05:16,969 --> 00:05:19,140
- It came up to your shoulders? - My hair used to be long.

132
00:05:19,140 --> 00:05:21,239
But considering everything, isn't he a real psycho?

133
00:05:21,909 --> 00:05:23,039
(Isn't he a real psycho then?)

134
00:05:23,039 --> 00:05:25,279
- That's true. - I meant the nickname.

135
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:28,979
- I was talking about his nickname. - That's right.

136
00:05:28,979 --> 00:05:31,549
All right. When you star on a variety show,

137
00:05:31,549 --> 00:05:34,419
we ask the guests to show a few impressions time to time.

138
00:05:34,419 --> 00:05:36,789
- It's hard to do that suddenly. - That's right.

139
00:05:36,789 --> 00:05:39,289
I know that he doesn't do them, but I'd like to ask him this.

140
00:05:39,289 --> 00:05:41,229
Can you do the line from "Miracle in Cell No. 7",

141
00:05:41,229 --> 00:05:42,429
"Ye Seung, eat your beans"?

142
00:05:42,429 --> 00:05:44,299
- I really want to see that. - Can you just do this one?

143
00:05:44,299 --> 00:05:45,630
- "Eat your beans"? - Yes.

144
00:05:45,630 --> 00:05:47,429
- "Ye Seung, eat your beans." - Only this line.

145
00:05:47,429 --> 00:05:49,969
(It was during a scene when he was feeding his daughter beans.)

146
00:05:49,969 --> 00:05:52,539
(Ye Seung, you must eat your beans. Eat your beans.)

147
00:05:52,539 --> 00:05:54,969
(He'll do that famous line...)

148
00:05:54,969 --> 00:05:56,880
I really want to see it in person. I really want to.

149
00:05:57,339 --> 00:05:59,409
- I'm getting excited. - Gosh, I'll see that in person?

150
00:05:59,409 --> 00:06:00,810
I really want to see that.

151
00:06:00,810 --> 00:06:04,580
(What will the famous line sound like after 6 years?)

152
00:06:05,650 --> 00:06:08,190
Ye Seung, you must eat your beans. Eat your beans.

153
00:06:08,190 --> 00:06:10,890
(Ye Seung, you must eat your beans. Eat your beans.)

154
00:06:10,890 --> 00:06:12,419
(Laughing)

155
00:06:12,419 --> 00:06:13,760
Say, "Sailor Moon", please.

156
00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:15,289
- Sailor Moon. - "Sailor Moon".

157
00:06:15,289 --> 00:06:16,929
Sailor Moon.

158
00:06:16,929 --> 00:06:18,000
(Poor Seung Ryong)

159
00:06:18,429 --> 00:06:20,400
- Sailor Moon. - He looks shy.

160
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:21,469
(Chocking suddenly)

161
00:06:21,469 --> 00:06:23,700
- Ye Seung. - Right. Seung Ryong...

162
00:06:23,700 --> 00:06:26,270
- Seung Ryong feels very shy. - Yes, I am.

163
00:06:26,270 --> 00:06:27,810
- I see. - Right.

164
00:06:27,810 --> 00:06:29,810
- I could feel it with his hands. - I really like that.

165
00:06:29,810 --> 00:06:31,710
- "Stop it." - "Stop it."

166
00:06:31,710 --> 00:06:33,479
- "That's enough." - "Stop it."

167
00:06:33,650 --> 00:06:36,080
- "Gosh, stop it." - Oh, my. I'm all red in the face.

168
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:37,179
- All right. - He's charming.

169
00:06:37,179 --> 00:06:40,650
My goodness. Next, we have Lee Dong Hwi.

170
00:06:40,650 --> 00:06:43,659
(Second suspect: Lee Dong Hwi)

171
00:06:44,620 --> 00:06:47,890
(A hot rookie the public loved with his performance of a retro role)

172
00:06:47,890 --> 00:06:51,630
(He's a fine supporting character as well as an impressive main lead.)

173
00:06:51,859 --> 00:06:55,370
(He has a broad spectrum when it comes to his acting.)

174
00:06:55,370 --> 00:06:58,440
(A new rising star of supporting characters, Lee Dong Hwi)

175
00:06:58,599 --> 00:07:00,539
- It's Lee Dong Hwi. - Gosh.

176
00:07:00,539 --> 00:07:02,039
He's so fair-skinned. Seriously.

177
00:07:02,039 --> 00:07:03,179
When he first walked in, I thought...

178
00:07:03,179 --> 00:07:04,940
- Tak Jae Hoon was walking in. - Seriously.

179
00:07:04,940 --> 00:07:06,979
When he first walked in, I thought Tak Jae Hoon was walking in.

180
00:07:06,979 --> 00:07:08,210
Seriously. They resemble each other so much.

181
00:07:08,210 --> 00:07:09,650
You look just like him.

182
00:07:09,650 --> 00:07:11,049
(He's the younger version of Jae Hoon.)

183
00:07:11,049 --> 00:07:12,219
I thought he was Jae Hoon.

184
00:07:12,219 --> 00:07:13,750
- Seriously. - I thought he was here.

185
00:07:13,820 --> 00:07:16,419
- He's the same age as Kwang Soo. - That's right.

186
00:07:16,419 --> 00:07:17,919
- Were you two friends? - We are close.

187
00:07:17,919 --> 00:07:19,560
- You two are friends. - Yes.

188
00:07:19,589 --> 00:07:21,989
- They were in "Entourage". - That's right.

189
00:07:21,989 --> 00:07:25,130
I met Seok Jin when I was filming the drama.

190
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:26,270
- When? - Yes, that's right.

191
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:28,830
- I was a cameo for the drama. - Cameo.

192
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:30,870
- We ran into each other. - That's right.

193
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,469
- I really wanted to tell him this. - We ran into each other...

194
00:07:33,469 --> 00:07:34,940
I told Kwang Soo this several times.

195
00:07:34,969 --> 00:07:37,339
Out of all the celebrities that I've seen in my life,

196
00:07:37,339 --> 00:07:39,109
he was the most fascinating, and I was the most nervous.

197
00:07:39,109 --> 00:07:41,080
(He was the most fascinating, and I was the most nervous.)

198
00:07:41,450 --> 00:07:42,849
That's true. He did mention that a lot.

199
00:07:42,849 --> 00:07:45,250
You are indeed my role model.

200
00:07:45,620 --> 00:07:48,650
I know why Dong Hwi feels this way.

201
00:07:49,320 --> 00:07:51,219
He's too arrogant compared to his popularity.

202
00:07:51,219 --> 00:07:54,229
(He's too arrogant compared to his popularity.)

203
00:07:54,789 --> 00:07:56,130
Compared to his popularity...

204
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:58,229
That is probably why...

205
00:07:58,229 --> 00:08:00,000
- he left an impression on Dong Hwi. - Probably.

206
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
This is why our meeting was so fascinating.

207
00:08:02,529 --> 00:08:04,400
Usually, people are different...

208
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:06,099
- on TV and in person, - That's right.

209
00:08:06,239 --> 00:08:09,010
but he said hello how he would say hi on TV.

210
00:08:09,339 --> 00:08:12,479
"Hey, nice to meet you. My gosh."

211
00:08:12,609 --> 00:08:13,779
"I see."

212
00:08:13,779 --> 00:08:15,510
He kept the same tone.

213
00:08:15,510 --> 00:08:17,919
- That arrogant tone of his? - No, I wouldn't say arrogant.

214
00:08:18,049 --> 00:08:21,120
- I'm the same on and off camera. - "I see. Nice to meet you."

215
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:23,489
We had a short interview with Dong Hwi.

216
00:08:23,489 --> 00:08:25,190
Let me introduce Ha Nee now.

217
00:08:25,190 --> 00:08:26,489
(It's time to interrogate the third suspect.)

218
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:28,890
- The third suspect! - Lee Ha Nee.

219
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:30,299
- Lee Ha Nee! - Lee Ha Nee!

220
00:08:30,659 --> 00:08:34,229
(Hey. Hello, everyone. Do you know who I am?)

221
00:08:34,330 --> 00:08:38,339
(Nothing is impossible for this lady who seems to be too perfect.)

222
00:08:38,339 --> 00:08:41,010
(She excels in acting and hosting shows. What is her limit?)

223
00:08:41,010 --> 00:08:44,010
(She excels in acting and hosting shows. What is her limit?)

224
00:08:44,339 --> 00:08:45,640
(The perfect role model, Lee Ha Nee)

225
00:08:45,640 --> 00:08:47,080
- Lee Ha Nee! - Lee Ha Nee!

226
00:08:47,409 --> 00:08:50,419
(Praise Ha Nee!)

227
00:08:50,419 --> 00:08:51,979
(The third interrogation begins with a vigorous cheer.)

228
00:08:51,979 --> 00:08:53,250
Gosh, seriously.

229
00:08:53,250 --> 00:08:54,589
She's so pretty.

230
00:08:54,750 --> 00:08:56,719
- You are so beautiful. - You are Se Chan's ideal type.

231
00:08:56,719 --> 00:08:59,320
- She's totally my type. I'm a fan. - She's so pretty.

232
00:08:59,320 --> 00:09:02,830
Seriously. Se Chan mentioned you...

233
00:09:02,830 --> 00:09:05,029
- a lot for his ideal type. - I always said it was you.

234
00:09:05,029 --> 00:09:06,200
- Right. - I'm such a big fan.

235
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:09,270
Se Chan, since when have you been her fan?

236
00:09:09,270 --> 00:09:10,470
When did it start?

237
00:09:10,470 --> 00:09:12,640
- I saw "Tazza-the Hidden Card". - "Tazza-the Hidden Card".

238
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:14,669
But she is such a great actress.

239
00:09:14,669 --> 00:09:16,340
But when you do a scene from the movie series,

240
00:09:16,340 --> 00:09:18,779
- you do Kim Hye Soo's impression. - That's true.

241
00:09:18,779 --> 00:09:20,350
That's just for my impression.

242
00:09:20,350 --> 00:09:21,610
Her lines are a bit too explicit.

243
00:09:21,650 --> 00:09:23,880
- It's inappropriate to do it on TV. - Is that so?

244
00:09:24,049 --> 00:09:25,279
- Yes. - Is that so?

245
00:09:25,279 --> 00:09:26,689
Can you do just one line?

246
00:09:27,490 --> 00:09:28,750
"Gosh, you witch." This one.

247
00:09:28,750 --> 00:09:30,860
(Copying Ha Nee)

248
00:09:30,860 --> 00:09:32,819
She did such a great job with this line.

249
00:09:32,819 --> 00:09:34,230
- That was done perfectly. - I know which one.

250
00:09:34,230 --> 00:09:36,029
- That's right. It was really good. - When I heard that...

251
00:09:36,159 --> 00:09:38,000
- Yes, that's right. - The thing is that...

252
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,100
Hearing such an unexpected line...

253
00:09:40,100 --> 00:09:41,730
- with her innocent face... - That's right.

254
00:09:41,829 --> 00:09:43,240
captivated me.

255
00:09:43,240 --> 00:09:45,470
That's how well she delivered the line.

256
00:09:45,900 --> 00:09:46,909
All right.

257
00:09:47,569 --> 00:09:49,610
I asked him to do a few lines earlier.

258
00:09:49,610 --> 00:09:50,880
- Me? - Could you...

259
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:53,350
- I'll do a different one. - Sure, sure.

260
00:09:53,750 --> 00:09:54,980
Do a different line, please.

261
00:09:55,179 --> 00:09:56,319
How old are you?

262
00:09:56,319 --> 00:09:57,419
Yes, that one.

263
00:09:58,779 --> 00:10:00,720
(Exuding a scary presence)

264
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:03,220
(Reenacting the scene perfectly)

265
00:10:03,220 --> 00:10:04,620
"How old are you?"

266
00:10:04,659 --> 00:10:05,760
That's the one.

267
00:10:05,860 --> 00:10:07,730
- Yes, that line. - She said that to Shin Sae Kyeong.

268
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:10,429
Of course. Next up is...

269
00:10:10,730 --> 00:10:12,860
- I almost didn't recognize him. - Same here.

270
00:10:12,929 --> 00:10:14,870
- He grew out his hair so much. - Right.

271
00:10:14,929 --> 00:10:16,539
- It's Jin Sun Kyu. - Yes, my hair did get very long.

272
00:10:16,539 --> 00:10:17,699
Right.

273
00:10:18,100 --> 00:10:21,669
(He captured the audience's eyes whenever he was in the scenes.)

274
00:10:21,669 --> 00:10:26,549
(He became popular rather late after the role of his lifetime.)

275
00:10:26,549 --> 00:10:29,510
(In real life, he cries a lot.)

276
00:10:29,510 --> 00:10:31,850
(Please don't get the wrong idea.)

277
00:10:31,850 --> 00:10:34,120
(He seems ruthless when he acts, but he's very soft-hearted.)

278
00:10:34,150 --> 00:10:36,520
(The actor with the finest acting, Jin Sun Kyu)

279
00:10:36,520 --> 00:10:39,090
Now, I feel a bit awkward with long hair.

280
00:10:39,090 --> 00:10:40,090
Really?

281
00:10:40,090 --> 00:10:41,590
- Yes. - He looks great with long hair.

282
00:10:41,860 --> 00:10:42,890
It looks like a wig.

283
00:10:42,890 --> 00:10:43,929
(He can't lie.)

284
00:10:44,929 --> 00:10:46,100
(He sounds firm.)

285
00:10:46,100 --> 00:10:47,429
(Really?)

286
00:10:47,429 --> 00:10:49,770
That's what I thought as well this morning.

287
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,539
(He's so innocent.)

288
00:10:51,539 --> 00:10:54,039
- We tease him too much. - Why do you do that?

289
00:10:54,039 --> 00:10:55,340
We just want to.

290
00:10:56,110 --> 00:10:57,340
Is he really responsive?

291
00:10:57,340 --> 00:10:58,840
- Yes. - I see.

292
00:10:58,840 --> 00:11:00,949
I beat him up a lot in the movie too.

293
00:11:00,949 --> 00:11:02,110
- Is that so? - Yes.

294
00:11:02,110 --> 00:11:03,380
It's weird, you know.

295
00:11:03,380 --> 00:11:04,380
She's just scary.

296
00:11:05,579 --> 00:11:07,390
(Ha Nee is just scary.)

297
00:11:07,390 --> 00:11:09,819
- She's scary. - When I raise my hand, he gets...

298
00:11:09,819 --> 00:11:11,390
- He's startled? - Yes.

299
00:11:11,390 --> 00:11:12,559
He was startled just now too.

300
00:11:12,760 --> 00:11:13,929
- Even just now... - I see.

301
00:11:13,929 --> 00:11:15,289
You were scared just now too.

302
00:11:15,390 --> 00:11:18,799
Yes, Ha Nee is younger than I am,

303
00:11:18,900 --> 00:11:20,929
- but she feels older than I am. - I see.

304
00:11:20,929 --> 00:11:22,429
- Some people are like that. - Right.

305
00:11:22,829 --> 00:11:25,770
Actually, Seok Jin is the oldest among us,

306
00:11:25,770 --> 00:11:27,970
but Jong Kook acts like the oldest among us.

307
00:11:28,270 --> 00:11:30,380
(Jong Kook acts like the oldest.)

308
00:11:30,380 --> 00:11:32,309
- He's the boss in this industry. - He's...

309
00:11:32,309 --> 00:11:33,679
He's the boss in this industry.

310
00:11:34,279 --> 00:11:36,309
We don't care about the age. That doesn't matter here.

311
00:11:36,309 --> 00:11:38,250
I call him during the national holidays to give him my regards.

312
00:11:39,250 --> 00:11:40,390
I check the time too...

313
00:11:40,390 --> 00:11:41,789
- to see when he'd call. - Right.

314
00:11:42,020 --> 00:11:43,159
You check the time?

315
00:11:43,159 --> 00:11:44,490
(He's scarier than Ha Nee.)

316
00:11:44,490 --> 00:11:46,120
(After the innocent-looking suspect number four...)

317
00:11:46,120 --> 00:11:47,760
Next, we have...

318
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:48,860
Gong Myoung.

319
00:11:48,860 --> 00:11:49,959
(The last suspect, Gong Myoung)

320
00:11:49,959 --> 00:11:51,829
- He's so handsome. - Right.

321
00:11:53,329 --> 00:11:57,770
(He won over the viewers with his big-puppy-like charms.)

322
00:11:57,770 --> 00:12:02,439
(Hobby: Exuding cute charms, Special Skill: Winning over ladies)

323
00:12:02,439 --> 00:12:07,010
(He can be a straightforward man and a lovely younger guy.)

324
00:12:07,010 --> 00:12:11,179
(A perfect actor and TV personality, there's no one like him.)

325
00:12:11,250 --> 00:12:13,350
- He has such a great proportion. - His body proportion is different.

326
00:12:13,350 --> 00:12:14,590
Yes, he is indeed handsome.

327
00:12:14,590 --> 00:12:15,750
Gosh, the coat...

328
00:12:15,850 --> 00:12:17,590
If you want to be tall, you should have his proportion.

329
00:12:17,590 --> 00:12:19,059
(Flinching)

330
00:12:19,059 --> 00:12:20,760
- The moment you said it... - Hey, what's wrong with you?

331
00:12:20,760 --> 00:12:22,829
- Hey, you're embarrassing us. - You don't usually wear coats.

332
00:12:23,199 --> 00:12:24,559
That's it. That's how it should be.

333
00:12:24,559 --> 00:12:27,130
- This is your 1st time on our show. - Yes, it is.

334
00:12:27,130 --> 00:12:29,799
What are you anticipating and what are you worried about?

335
00:12:30,039 --> 00:12:31,600
Well, as for me,

336
00:12:32,140 --> 00:12:34,470
This... I mean...

337
00:12:34,470 --> 00:12:37,409
- I was excited to see you all. - That's right.

338
00:12:37,409 --> 00:12:39,079
- It was the same for all of us. - Especially, which member?

339
00:12:39,079 --> 00:12:40,279
(Which member did he want to meet the most?)

340
00:12:40,279 --> 00:12:41,309
For me, it was you.

341
00:12:41,309 --> 00:12:42,579
No, not him. Don't include him.

342
00:12:42,949 --> 00:12:43,949
- Why not? - Why wouldn't he?

343
00:12:43,949 --> 00:12:45,720
Everyone would choose him. Let's not include him.

344
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:46,919
- Why would we not include him? - He's...

345
00:12:46,919 --> 00:12:48,590
- Please exclude me. - Pick one excluding Jae Seok.

346
00:12:48,590 --> 00:12:51,020
He has high expectations because Dong Hwi said he liked him.

347
00:12:52,890 --> 00:12:54,329
Okay. Which member then?

348
00:12:54,329 --> 00:12:55,760
(Well, if I were to choose again...)

349
00:12:55,789 --> 00:12:57,230
Okay. Which member then?

350
00:12:59,029 --> 00:13:00,770
(Glancing)

351
00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:02,669
(Could that be me?)

352
00:13:02,669 --> 00:13:04,100
I've never met...

353
00:13:04,470 --> 00:13:06,240
(Gong Myoung has never met...)

354
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:07,770
I've never met...

355
00:13:08,209 --> 00:13:09,709
- Mr. Jee Seok Jin. - Seok Jin?

356
00:13:09,909 --> 00:13:11,340
It's my first time meeting everyone here, but...

357
00:13:11,610 --> 00:13:12,679
(She feels defeated for some reason.)

358
00:13:12,679 --> 00:13:14,679
- You were curious about him. - You've never met him before.

359
00:13:14,949 --> 00:13:16,380
- It's my first time meeting him. - You've never met him?

360
00:13:16,380 --> 00:13:17,620
No, never.

361
00:13:17,850 --> 00:13:19,319
You've never seen him on TV?

362
00:13:19,319 --> 00:13:20,720
Yes. No, no.

363
00:13:20,919 --> 00:13:22,650
(I've never seen him on TV.)

364
00:13:22,650 --> 00:13:24,520
(No, no.)

365
00:13:24,860 --> 00:13:26,020
This is his first time seeing Seok Jin.

366
00:13:26,020 --> 00:13:28,090
I've been on TV for 20 years. You think that's possible?

367
00:13:28,090 --> 00:13:29,490
- That's possible. - You know?

368
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:31,429
- He might not have seen you. - This is almost...

369
00:13:31,429 --> 00:13:33,600
- I've never met him either. - Who?

370
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:34,730
Mr. Gong Myoung.

371
00:13:34,730 --> 00:13:35,829
- I've never seen him. - It's my first time seeing her.

372
00:13:35,829 --> 00:13:37,100
- Is that so? - Yes.

373
00:13:37,100 --> 00:13:38,240
- Go get him. - He forgot about me.

374
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:39,600
- No, that's not what I'm doing. - Okay.

375
00:13:40,010 --> 00:13:42,640
- These days, So Min is... - She's getting started.

376
00:13:42,640 --> 00:13:45,579
- following Kwang Soo's footstep. - Right.

377
00:13:45,610 --> 00:13:47,179
- She's the romantic. - Yes, a bit.

378
00:13:47,179 --> 00:13:49,079
- The female version of a romantic. - She's the romantic?

379
00:13:49,079 --> 00:13:50,779
- She's the first female. - It will continue on.

380
00:13:50,779 --> 00:13:52,250
We're telling you in advance,

381
00:13:52,250 --> 00:13:53,720
- so you're not flustered. - Okay, okay.

382
00:13:53,750 --> 00:13:55,250
You've seen So Min, right?

383
00:13:55,250 --> 00:13:56,620
- Yes, of course. - You've seen her on TV.

384
00:13:56,620 --> 00:13:57,689
How was it?

385
00:13:57,689 --> 00:13:59,959
She's much cuter in person.

386
00:13:59,959 --> 00:14:01,059
Thank you.

387
00:14:01,260 --> 00:14:02,990
She started. She's getting her move on.

388
00:14:03,090 --> 00:14:04,400
She's getting started.

389
00:14:04,500 --> 00:14:07,230
- What's wrong with you? Stop. - Gosh, So Min.

390
00:14:07,669 --> 00:14:10,299
- This signals that she started. - She pushes back her hair.

391
00:14:10,299 --> 00:14:12,939
- She applies ointment on here... - Because she scratches.

392
00:14:12,939 --> 00:14:14,209
because she does that all the time.

393
00:14:14,939 --> 00:14:16,169
All right then.

394
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:17,610
Since we're on the subject, use his name...

395
00:14:17,980 --> 00:14:20,010
- to come up with an acrostic poem. - Yes, you must go for it.

396
00:14:20,279 --> 00:14:21,549
- With his name. - Take it seriously.

397
00:14:21,809 --> 00:14:23,220
- This is too hard. - Okay.

398
00:14:23,220 --> 00:14:24,819
Should I start with the first syllable?

399
00:14:24,949 --> 00:14:26,179
- This is too hard. - Okay.

400
00:14:26,179 --> 00:14:27,620
Should I start with the first syllable?

401
00:14:27,789 --> 00:14:29,549
Gong Myoung is talking.

402
00:14:29,549 --> 00:14:33,059
(Gong Myoung is talking.)

403
00:14:33,059 --> 00:14:34,189
The second syllable.

404
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:39,360
(What did I say?)

405
00:14:41,329 --> 00:14:42,529
(Barking)

406
00:14:44,140 --> 00:14:46,770
(Myoung, Myoung, Myoung!)

407
00:14:46,909 --> 00:14:48,939
- That was cute. - That was cute.

408
00:14:49,039 --> 00:14:50,140
- Well done. - Great job.

409
00:14:50,140 --> 00:14:51,510
She did well.

410
00:14:51,840 --> 00:14:53,279
- That was great. - You're good.

411
00:14:53,980 --> 00:14:56,480
All right. I'll tell you the rules now.

412
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:59,279
Today is the third episode of the Level Up Race.

413
00:14:59,779 --> 00:15:01,419
It's the Level Fabrication Incident.

414
00:15:03,260 --> 00:15:05,689
Out of these 5 suspects, 1 of them...

415
00:15:05,689 --> 00:15:08,159
is a real forger who is helping the thieves.

416
00:15:08,329 --> 00:15:11,100
And one of the suspects is a police officer on his or her stakeout...

417
00:15:11,100 --> 00:15:13,329
- to catch the thieves. - Is it a detective?

418
00:15:13,329 --> 00:15:15,100
- I see. Out of these 5 suspects? - Just 1?

419
00:15:15,669 --> 00:15:17,900
- 1 is a police officer. - 1 is a forger.

420
00:15:17,900 --> 00:15:19,909
(A forger and a police officer are among them.)

421
00:15:20,709 --> 00:15:22,010
Before the race ends,

422
00:15:22,010 --> 00:15:25,039
if the civilians find and eliminate thieves and forger,

423
00:15:25,039 --> 00:15:26,809
it's Team Civilian and Police's victory.

424
00:15:27,549 --> 00:15:29,579
If the thieves and the forger conceal their identities to the end,

425
00:15:29,579 --> 00:15:32,949
and eliminate the police and members whose levels were stolen,

426
00:15:32,949 --> 00:15:35,020
It's Team Thieves and Forger's victory.

427
00:15:36,020 --> 00:15:37,020
Gosh, my head hurts now.

428
00:15:37,020 --> 00:15:40,390
As for the members, you will earn the levels of the thieves...

429
00:15:40,490 --> 00:15:42,090
- whom you eliminate. - I see. This?

430
00:15:42,159 --> 00:15:43,600
Something was fabricated here?

431
00:15:43,699 --> 00:15:47,669
(They set out for the first mission to find the clues.)

432
00:15:49,230 --> 00:15:51,199
The first quest will begin.

433
00:15:51,199 --> 00:15:52,669
(A quest has been discovered.)

434
00:15:52,770 --> 00:15:54,010
The first mission is...

435
00:15:54,169 --> 00:15:56,039
- Suspect's Preference. - Preference?

436
00:15:56,169 --> 00:15:57,309
Preference.

437
00:15:59,039 --> 00:16:00,409
To answer yes-or-no questions,

438
00:16:00,409 --> 00:16:02,880
you will choose either O or X.

439
00:16:03,150 --> 00:16:04,850
After presenting the first argument,

440
00:16:04,850 --> 00:16:06,549
you can share your opinions with each other.

441
00:16:06,620 --> 00:16:08,220
You will decide for the second time.

442
00:16:08,220 --> 00:16:11,860
Depending on the result, the majority will earn one point,

443
00:16:11,860 --> 00:16:14,289
and the minority will face a penalty with the toy hammer.

444
00:16:15,059 --> 00:16:17,559
This game is about being the majority.

445
00:16:17,559 --> 00:16:19,360
However, if there is a unanimous decision,

446
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:21,529
the person next to you will execute the toy hammer penalty.

447
00:16:21,529 --> 00:16:23,299
We can't have a unanimous decision.

448
00:16:23,299 --> 00:16:24,740
(Let's avoid being the minority and the unanimous decision.)

449
00:16:24,740 --> 00:16:26,169
The one who wins the mission...

450
00:16:26,169 --> 00:16:28,039
will be given a hint of his or her choice.

451
00:16:28,039 --> 00:16:30,709
(The winner can get a hint about the thieves or the police.)

452
00:16:30,709 --> 00:16:32,840
Here's the first question.

453
00:16:32,840 --> 00:16:34,209
(A war of wits to avoid getting a unanimous decision)

454
00:16:34,209 --> 00:16:35,250
Here it goes.

455
00:16:35,480 --> 00:16:36,779
The leader of a team...

456
00:16:36,779 --> 00:16:40,620
must pay for the first round of the gathering and head home.

457
00:16:41,049 --> 00:16:43,720
If you agree, choose O. If you disagree, choose X.

458
00:16:43,959 --> 00:16:45,760
Did you come up with it because of Jae Seok?

459
00:16:46,289 --> 00:16:47,289
Probably.

460
00:16:47,730 --> 00:16:48,959
This is your first decision.

461
00:16:49,059 --> 00:16:50,900
1, 2, 3.

462
00:16:52,159 --> 00:16:54,970
(7 members become the majority, and 6, the minority.)

463
00:16:54,970 --> 00:16:56,569
- Well, as for this... - He should go home.

464
00:16:56,569 --> 00:16:57,770
- You chose X, right? - It should be X.

465
00:16:57,770 --> 00:16:59,169
He should leave at the right timing.

466
00:16:59,169 --> 00:17:00,740
- That's the mature thing to do. - Honestly speaking,

467
00:17:00,740 --> 00:17:04,079
with the leader there, the others can't talk freely.

468
00:17:04,079 --> 00:17:06,010
- Leaders are meant to be lonely. - Right.

469
00:17:06,539 --> 00:17:09,150
Director Kang Woo Seok is like that.

470
00:17:09,150 --> 00:17:12,350
During team dinners, after giving a toast a few times,

471
00:17:12,350 --> 00:17:13,819
he disappears quietly.

472
00:17:14,520 --> 00:17:15,620
Then the real party starts.

473
00:17:15,620 --> 00:17:17,459
Only then.

474
00:17:17,459 --> 00:17:18,459
Exactly.

475
00:17:18,459 --> 00:17:19,760
Team dinners are different from other events.

476
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:20,860
Ha Nee, you chose O too?

477
00:17:20,860 --> 00:17:21,929
- Yes. - Why?

478
00:17:22,230 --> 00:17:24,829
Knowing when to leave...

479
00:17:24,829 --> 00:17:26,929
is a virtue of good leaders.

480
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,569
That makes sense.

481
00:17:29,870 --> 00:17:31,699
- It's X. - The leader should be responsible.

482
00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:34,110
- He should take care of the team. - To the end.

483
00:17:34,110 --> 00:17:36,209
He should pay for the second round too.

484
00:17:36,209 --> 00:17:38,880
I think the leader should stay for the second round.

485
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:40,850
- Stay for the 2nd round. - Stay for the 2nd round.

486
00:17:40,850 --> 00:17:42,409
- He should pay. - Of course.

487
00:17:42,409 --> 00:17:44,050
Seok Jin, what did you choose?

488
00:17:44,050 --> 00:17:45,919
- I chose O. - Why?

489
00:17:45,919 --> 00:17:47,489
The leader should leave at the right time.

490
00:17:47,489 --> 00:17:49,719
- And why didn't you? - What do you mean?

491
00:17:50,219 --> 00:17:52,719
(You're the oldest. Why didn't you leave?)

492
00:17:52,719 --> 00:17:56,060
After the Entertainment Awards, Jae Seok left first.

493
00:17:56,060 --> 00:17:58,600
Seok Jin stayed, obliviously.

494
00:17:59,429 --> 00:18:00,630
Why did you stay?

495
00:18:00,630 --> 00:18:02,800
The conversation was so lively.

496
00:18:03,540 --> 00:18:05,840
(It was so fun talking to the younger guys.)

497
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:08,939
They all listened carefully to what I said.

498
00:18:08,939 --> 00:18:10,810
(I enjoyed having everyone listen to me a bit too much.)

499
00:18:10,810 --> 00:18:12,939
- I couldn't bring myself to leave. - That's why.

500
00:18:12,939 --> 00:18:14,509
Still, your opinion is this.

501
00:18:14,909 --> 00:18:16,709
Once, we had a year-end party.

502
00:18:16,709 --> 00:18:19,249
After we had dinner together,

503
00:18:19,249 --> 00:18:21,320
Jong Kook and I wanted to have a drink somewhere alone.

504
00:18:21,320 --> 00:18:23,459
But Ji Hyo kept following us.

505
00:18:23,459 --> 00:18:25,519
(We wanted to be alone.)

506
00:18:25,519 --> 00:18:26,929
- It was a very awkward moment. - In the end,

507
00:18:26,929 --> 00:18:29,360
we had to go to my place.

508
00:18:29,560 --> 00:18:32,060
And Ji Hyo had her manager tail us.

509
00:18:32,060 --> 00:18:33,130
(Ji Hyo had her manager tail them.)

510
00:18:33,229 --> 00:18:34,269
(Follow them.)

511
00:18:34,269 --> 00:18:35,800
She followed us to my place.

512
00:18:35,800 --> 00:18:37,340
I was there too.

513
00:18:37,340 --> 00:18:38,499
(Why leave me out?)

514
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:40,769
(Seok Jin was there?)

515
00:18:40,769 --> 00:18:43,110
- I didn't know. - I thought we were alone.

516
00:18:43,110 --> 00:18:45,239
- I was there too. - That's right.

517
00:18:45,239 --> 00:18:46,679
I can't believe you.

518
00:18:46,679 --> 00:18:49,209
- Know when to leave. - Know when to leave.

519
00:18:49,380 --> 00:18:50,979
Kwang Soo, why did you choose X?

520
00:18:50,979 --> 00:18:52,749
I have a different opinion.

521
00:18:52,749 --> 00:18:55,790
I want the leader to hand over his or her credit card and leave.

522
00:18:55,919 --> 00:18:57,820
- And not come to the dinner at all? - No.

523
00:18:58,060 --> 00:19:01,060
- Not even to the dinner. - Seok Jin is my leader forever.

524
00:19:01,259 --> 00:19:03,459
Seok Jin is my leader forever.

525
00:19:03,459 --> 00:19:04,630
(Remember the leader's role.)

526
00:19:04,729 --> 00:19:06,130
My leader.

527
00:19:06,229 --> 00:19:07,400
My role model.

528
00:19:07,400 --> 00:19:08,830
What do you think, So Min?

529
00:19:09,030 --> 00:19:12,070
So Min changed from O to X because of Gong Myoung.

530
00:19:12,070 --> 00:19:14,169
(Guilty)

531
00:19:14,509 --> 00:19:17,179
I think the leader should stay.

532
00:19:17,179 --> 00:19:18,209
(Gong Myoung chose X?)

533
00:19:19,140 --> 00:19:20,810
(So Min changed her opinion.)

534
00:19:21,050 --> 00:19:23,979
(I want to have the same opinion as Gong Myoung.)

535
00:19:23,979 --> 00:19:25,949
Is this "Love Studio"?

536
00:19:26,380 --> 00:19:28,219
I agree with Gong Myoung.

537
00:19:28,219 --> 00:19:29,320
(Whatever his opinion is,)

538
00:19:29,320 --> 00:19:31,890
(Gong Myoung and I are one.)

539
00:19:31,989 --> 00:19:33,959
- You agree with him? - So Min.

540
00:19:33,959 --> 00:19:36,189
- I love her character. - I can't believe her.

541
00:19:36,330 --> 00:19:38,060
She took over the character completely.

542
00:19:38,060 --> 00:19:39,530
Kwang Soo, you don't have to worry.

543
00:19:39,530 --> 00:19:42,330
She took over your character.

544
00:19:42,630 --> 00:19:44,540
- I feel proud. - My goodness.

545
00:19:44,540 --> 00:19:46,810
She took it over completely.

546
00:19:46,870 --> 00:19:49,370
Everyone, we'll take another vote.

547
00:19:49,370 --> 00:19:51,679
But we have to avoid a unanimous decision.

548
00:19:51,679 --> 00:19:53,179
And you want to be in the majority.

549
00:19:53,179 --> 00:19:55,850
The discussion made me consider changing my mind.

550
00:19:55,850 --> 00:19:58,719
It's hard to predict. It'll be half and half.

551
00:19:58,719 --> 00:19:59,979
Let's go.

552
00:19:59,979 --> 00:20:01,850
(Final decision)

553
00:20:02,390 --> 00:20:05,989
(In the 1st vote, only 1 more person chose O.)

554
00:20:06,120 --> 00:20:07,630
(Will the result be different?)

555
00:20:07,630 --> 00:20:08,729
Put it up.

556
00:20:09,330 --> 00:20:12,699
(12 people choose O, 1 person chooses X.)

557
00:20:12,699 --> 00:20:13,769
Is it unanimous?

558
00:20:14,130 --> 00:20:15,600
- I'm relieved. - I'm relieved.

559
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:17,140
Dong Hwi.

560
00:20:17,340 --> 00:20:18,499
You...

561
00:20:18,900 --> 00:20:20,969
I knew this would happen.

562
00:20:20,969 --> 00:20:22,409
Dong Hwi.

563
00:20:22,540 --> 00:20:24,009
Dong Hwi!

564
00:20:24,009 --> 00:20:27,449
- Dong Hwi. - Bye, Dong Hwi.

565
00:20:27,449 --> 00:20:28,749
- Only Dong Hwi? - Only one person?

566
00:20:28,749 --> 00:20:31,080
Only Dong Hwi chose X.

567
00:20:31,080 --> 00:20:32,650
Thank you, Dong Hwi.

568
00:20:32,719 --> 00:20:35,550
- Thank you. - You saved the entire team.

569
00:20:35,620 --> 00:20:36,959
Have you been hit by one of these?

570
00:20:36,959 --> 00:20:38,090
- No. - No?

571
00:20:38,090 --> 00:20:39,189
It's your first time.

572
00:20:39,189 --> 00:20:42,060
(This is my first toy hammer experience.)

573
00:20:42,060 --> 00:20:47,229
(And I will be hit by my idol, Seok Jin.)

574
00:20:47,330 --> 00:20:49,600
(I'm overwhelmed.)

575
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:51,800
(Thud)

576
00:20:51,800 --> 00:20:54,469
(The idol's powerful blow)

577
00:20:54,469 --> 00:20:56,009
Was it too hard?

578
00:20:56,340 --> 00:20:58,580
Pull his head out.

579
00:20:58,580 --> 00:21:00,909
(So this is how it's done on a variety show.)

580
00:21:00,909 --> 00:21:02,749
Pull his head out.

581
00:21:03,080 --> 00:21:05,120
- He needed to experience it. - Good.

582
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:06,150
He needed to...

583
00:21:06,150 --> 00:21:07,890
- Otherwise, it wouldn't be fun. - Did you see that?

584
00:21:07,890 --> 00:21:09,989
- Dong Hwi, see? - He's taking off his jacket.

585
00:21:10,360 --> 00:21:12,259
- Dong Hwi is a bit upset. - No.

586
00:21:12,759 --> 00:21:16,229
- Here is an easy one. - Okay.

587
00:21:16,229 --> 00:21:17,300
Here we go.

588
00:21:17,300 --> 00:21:21,330
After eating meat, should you eat spicy noodles or cold noodles?

589
00:21:21,330 --> 00:21:22,330
(This is too hard.)

590
00:21:22,330 --> 00:21:23,530
This is...

591
00:21:24,239 --> 00:21:25,439
(It's never easy.)

592
00:21:25,439 --> 00:21:26,600
This is...

593
00:21:26,600 --> 00:21:28,209
O for cold noodles,

594
00:21:28,209 --> 00:21:30,479
- and X for spicy noodles. - I share with others.

595
00:21:31,340 --> 00:21:32,340
(What is their 1st choice?)

596
00:21:32,340 --> 00:21:34,280
This is...

597
00:21:34,280 --> 00:21:36,509
It's obvious.

598
00:21:36,509 --> 00:21:38,780
1, 2, 3.

599
00:21:38,780 --> 00:21:40,249
Spicy noodles, of course.

600
00:21:40,249 --> 00:21:42,419
(10 people choose O, 3 people choose X.)

601
00:21:42,419 --> 00:21:44,890
- It's cold noodles. - It's spicy noodles.

602
00:21:44,890 --> 00:21:46,259
- It's spicy noodles. - Really?

603
00:21:46,259 --> 00:21:48,360
- It's spicy noodles. - Of course, it's cold noodles.

604
00:21:48,360 --> 00:21:50,090
There is one more person who chose spicy noodles.

605
00:21:50,090 --> 00:21:52,630
- It's spicy noodles. - It's spicy noodles.

606
00:21:52,659 --> 00:21:55,699
Let me tell you as someone who runs a barbecue restaurant.

607
00:21:55,699 --> 00:21:58,870
Spicy noodles is something you eat during the meal.

608
00:21:58,870 --> 00:22:00,709
- With meat. - You eat it with meat.

609
00:22:00,709 --> 00:22:03,610
At the end, you cleanse the palate with cold noodles.

610
00:22:03,610 --> 00:22:05,080
Okay?

611
00:22:05,080 --> 00:22:07,850
If you eat spicy noodles to finish off the meal,

612
00:22:07,850 --> 00:22:09,810
your breath smells like garlic all day.

613
00:22:10,050 --> 00:22:11,320
Cold noodles wash down...

614
00:22:11,320 --> 00:22:12,949
Your breath can smell like cold noodles too.

615
00:22:12,949 --> 00:22:14,820
The radish kimchi broth is so refreshing.

616
00:22:14,820 --> 00:22:16,350
It makes you smell like radish kimchi.

617
00:22:16,350 --> 00:22:17,689
- What are you talking about? - Yes.

618
00:22:17,689 --> 00:22:20,290
After the meal, the spicy noodles...

619
00:22:20,290 --> 00:22:22,590
freshen up your mouth.

620
00:22:22,590 --> 00:22:24,499
Only when you finish with the spicy noodles,

621
00:22:24,499 --> 00:22:26,060
(Ha Nee chooses spicy noodles.)

622
00:22:26,060 --> 00:22:28,199
you feel fulfilled.

623
00:22:28,199 --> 00:22:30,800
That's what you feel after eating the cold noodles.

624
00:22:30,800 --> 00:22:34,239
- With some ice. - With vinegar and mustard.

625
00:22:34,239 --> 00:22:35,269
Exactly.

626
00:22:35,370 --> 00:22:39,110
Then we'll all choose O...

627
00:22:39,179 --> 00:22:40,509
and be penalized together.

628
00:22:40,509 --> 00:22:42,509
(We'll all choose O and be penalized.)

629
00:22:42,509 --> 00:22:44,679
- He is threatening us. - If you keep doing this...

630
00:22:44,679 --> 00:22:46,820
If you don't help us...

631
00:22:46,820 --> 00:22:49,390
- Help us, or I'll take action. - Why is he doing this?

632
00:22:49,390 --> 00:22:51,060
Let me tell you again.

633
00:22:51,060 --> 00:22:53,159
Some of you should open your hearts to us.

634
00:22:53,159 --> 00:22:55,229
Otherwise, we'll all choose O.

635
00:22:55,229 --> 00:22:56,830
Let's choose O.

636
00:22:57,429 --> 00:22:59,759
Personally, my favorite is...

637
00:22:59,759 --> 00:23:02,830
adding a cup of cold noodles to spicy noodles.

638
00:23:02,830 --> 00:23:05,169
- That's nice. - Right.

639
00:23:05,169 --> 00:23:07,640
It still counts as spicy noodles.

640
00:23:07,640 --> 00:23:10,239
- Let's say that's spicy noodles. - Yes.

641
00:23:10,239 --> 00:23:12,110
All right. Let me ask you for the last time.

642
00:23:12,110 --> 00:23:15,179
O for cold noodles, X for spicy noodles.

643
00:23:15,350 --> 00:23:16,380
One...

644
00:23:17,519 --> 00:23:20,550
(Only 3 people chose X in the 1st vote.)

645
00:23:20,550 --> 00:23:21,820
- One, - O.

646
00:23:21,820 --> 00:23:23,350
2, 3.

647
00:23:23,350 --> 00:23:27,189
(Will Team Spicy Noodles' secret strategy work?)

648
00:23:27,189 --> 00:23:30,290
(12 people choose O, 1 person choose X.)

649
00:23:30,290 --> 00:23:31,330
(I'm the only one who chose X?)

650
00:23:31,330 --> 00:23:33,030
Jae Seok...

651
00:23:33,030 --> 00:23:34,729
- Ha Nee, I said O. - Jae Seok.

652
00:23:35,570 --> 00:23:37,400
- I said O. - He's so mean.

653
00:23:37,400 --> 00:23:38,400
(You didn't hear me?)

654
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:40,140
- Jae Seok. - Jae Seok.

655
00:23:40,140 --> 00:23:41,269
- Jae Seok. - I said...

656
00:23:41,269 --> 00:23:43,040
- I said O. - When?

657
00:23:43,040 --> 00:23:44,540
I said O, didn't I?

658
00:23:44,540 --> 00:23:46,310
I heard it and changed my mind.

659
00:23:46,310 --> 00:23:49,110
Exactly. I said O.

660
00:23:49,110 --> 00:23:52,780
You said you were going to pick spicy noodles...

661
00:23:52,780 --> 00:23:53,919
What?

662
00:23:53,919 --> 00:23:56,489
You said you were going to...

663
00:23:56,489 --> 00:23:58,219
- What? - Speak clearly.

664
00:23:58,219 --> 00:24:00,630
- You were craving spicy noodles. - I was,

665
00:24:00,630 --> 00:24:02,189
but the majority was choosing O.

666
00:24:02,189 --> 00:24:04,560
- Se Chan will have to... - Okay.

667
00:24:04,560 --> 00:24:06,830
- As her fan. - It's too sad.

668
00:24:07,669 --> 00:24:10,900
(Do you remember?)

669
00:24:10,999 --> 00:24:16,340
(You are my dream girl.)

670
00:24:16,610 --> 00:24:19,040
(With all my love...)

671
00:24:19,040 --> 00:24:21,209
(Thud)

672
00:24:21,209 --> 00:24:25,320
(She is hit hard by her fan.)

673
00:24:26,919 --> 00:24:28,590
It was out of my love for her.

674
00:24:29,050 --> 00:24:31,459
(He pulls out her head too.)

675
00:24:32,489 --> 00:24:35,290
(It looks scary.)

676
00:24:35,290 --> 00:24:36,360
How was it?

677
00:24:36,360 --> 00:24:39,300
I've never been hit like this since I became a grown-up.

678
00:24:39,929 --> 00:24:41,070
It's a new experience.

679
00:24:41,699 --> 00:24:43,429
Here is the last question.

680
00:24:43,499 --> 00:24:45,640
It will be a tricky one again.

681
00:24:45,640 --> 00:24:48,040
At a team dinner, what do you sing to brighten up the mood,

682
00:24:48,040 --> 00:24:50,409
a dance song or a trot song?

683
00:24:50,580 --> 00:24:53,709
(Not this again.)

684
00:24:53,709 --> 00:24:56,509
(It's another difficult choice.)

685
00:24:56,850 --> 00:24:59,679
(A dance song makes everyone dance.)

686
00:24:59,679 --> 00:25:03,689
(A trot song makes everyone sing along.)

687
00:25:03,689 --> 00:25:05,759
- It's hard. - A dance song or a trot song?

688
00:25:05,759 --> 00:25:07,159
It's hard.

689
00:25:07,159 --> 00:25:08,390
It's another hard one.

690
00:25:08,390 --> 00:25:10,390
O for a dance song, X for a trot song.

691
00:25:10,390 --> 00:25:11,860
1, 2, 3.

692
00:25:12,429 --> 00:25:15,999
(8 people choose O, 5 people choose X.)

693
00:25:15,999 --> 00:25:17,900
- It's a dance song. - No.

694
00:25:17,900 --> 00:25:19,499
(It's definitely a dance song.)

695
00:25:19,499 --> 00:25:20,509
It's a trot song.

696
00:25:20,509 --> 00:25:22,840
- It's a dance song. - It's a trot song.

697
00:25:22,840 --> 00:25:26,080
When someone sings a dance song, you're pressured to dance.

698
00:25:26,080 --> 00:25:27,110
It brightens up the mood.

699
00:25:27,110 --> 00:25:29,409
But a trot song is easy to sing along to.

700
00:25:29,409 --> 00:25:32,320
Trot songs are witty.

701
00:25:32,320 --> 00:25:35,320
- If you sing in an amusing way... - I'm tired now

702
00:25:35,320 --> 00:25:36,890
(Let us show you.)

703
00:25:37,689 --> 00:25:38,820
(Team Trot becomes one.)

704
00:25:38,820 --> 00:25:39,890
They sing along immediately.

705
00:25:40,489 --> 00:25:42,689
(Team Dance fights back.)

706
00:25:42,689 --> 00:25:45,360
(They start dancing immediately.)

707
00:25:45,759 --> 00:25:47,769
(Nothing brightens up the mood like a dance song.)

708
00:25:47,769 --> 00:25:48,929
All right.

709
00:25:48,929 --> 00:25:51,040
(Fill me with your love)

710
00:25:51,769 --> 00:25:53,840
(A trot song is better.)

711
00:25:54,540 --> 00:25:56,840
(This is it.)

712
00:25:57,509 --> 00:25:59,679
(It's not working.)

713
00:25:59,679 --> 00:26:01,909
Even though Jong Kook chose dance,

714
00:26:02,050 --> 00:26:03,919
he sang along to the trot song.

715
00:26:03,919 --> 00:26:04,979
Seriously.

716
00:26:04,979 --> 00:26:07,249
(You saw that?)

717
00:26:07,650 --> 00:26:09,419
(As soon as he hears Jin Young's song...)

718
00:26:09,419 --> 00:26:12,620
(Dancing)

719
00:26:12,620 --> 00:26:14,959
(Kwang Soo catches it.)

720
00:26:14,959 --> 00:26:16,090
Seriously.

721
00:26:16,259 --> 00:26:18,400
He reacted to Jin Young's song immediately.

722
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:20,870
- No. - Of course.

723
00:26:20,870 --> 00:26:23,169
When you go to a karaoke bar,

724
00:26:23,169 --> 00:26:25,570
what do you usually sing?

725
00:26:25,570 --> 00:26:27,610
Among trot songs,

726
00:26:27,769 --> 00:26:29,239
"Daring Woman".

727
00:26:30,580 --> 00:26:32,110
(It definitely brightens up the mood.)

728
00:26:32,110 --> 00:26:33,310
You clapped your hands.

729
00:26:33,310 --> 00:26:35,050
It suits her.

730
00:26:35,050 --> 00:26:37,320
- It suits her. - Can we hear it?

731
00:26:37,320 --> 00:26:38,449
- Please. - "Daring Woman".

732
00:26:38,449 --> 00:26:40,320
- Okay! - Play it!

733
00:26:40,479 --> 00:26:42,489
Kwang Soo, play it before she changes her mind.

734
00:26:42,489 --> 00:26:44,560
We'll show you how it brings everyone together.

735
00:26:44,820 --> 00:26:46,159
It'll bring us together?

736
00:26:46,159 --> 00:26:47,360
I love this song.

737
00:26:47,360 --> 00:26:48,689
- Ha Nee. - "Daring Woman".

738
00:26:48,689 --> 00:26:50,189
This song is nice.

739
00:26:50,189 --> 00:26:51,400
I love it.

740
00:26:51,400 --> 00:26:54,330
(What should I do? Something like this?)

741
00:26:54,999 --> 00:26:56,630
(Daring steps)

742
00:26:56,630 --> 00:26:58,570
(She is warming up.)

743
00:26:58,769 --> 00:27:00,840
Everyone, come forward!

744
00:27:01,810 --> 00:27:03,409
Now that we're here...

745
00:27:03,640 --> 00:27:05,780
We're here to promote "Extreme Job".

746
00:27:05,780 --> 00:27:09,610
Please send a lot of love to "Extreme Job"!

747
00:27:09,610 --> 00:27:11,479
(A brave knee slide)

748
00:27:11,550 --> 00:27:12,679
Let's go!

749
00:27:12,679 --> 00:27:14,850
(Ha Nee's cheerful intro gives Team Trot confidence.)

750
00:27:14,850 --> 00:27:16,820
- Go, Ha Nee! - Go, Ha Nee!

751
00:27:16,820 --> 00:27:18,459
- Okay! - Lee Ha Nee!

752
00:27:18,659 --> 00:27:19,959
(You're not smiling on purpose, right?)

753
00:27:19,959 --> 00:27:20,959
(Poking)

754
00:27:20,959 --> 00:27:22,030
- Right? - Right?

755
00:27:22,030 --> 00:27:23,890
(Everyone sings along.)

756
00:27:24,659 --> 00:27:26,699
(A trot song is fun, right?)

757
00:27:27,469 --> 00:27:29,199
(Even Team Dance sings along automatically.)

758
00:27:30,030 --> 00:27:33,900
(I know you're afraid of falling in love with trot)

759
00:27:34,340 --> 00:27:35,409
Lee Ha Nee!

760
00:27:36,610 --> 00:27:38,810
(Ha Nee shoots hearts at Kwang Soo.)

761
00:27:38,810 --> 00:27:40,310
You pretend uninterested

762
00:27:40,310 --> 00:27:42,110
(You want to join Team Trot?)

763
00:27:43,209 --> 00:27:45,219
- Eyes! - Kwang Soo.

764
00:27:45,219 --> 00:27:48,120
- Here it comes. - Love Giraffe!

765
00:27:48,120 --> 00:27:49,790
(He stares into space.)

766
00:27:49,790 --> 00:27:51,159
Ha Nee.

767
00:27:52,219 --> 00:27:53,390
She's amazing.

768
00:27:53,719 --> 00:27:55,390
(Seductive)

769
00:27:55,729 --> 00:27:57,630
(Cute)

770
00:27:57,630 --> 00:27:59,800
(She moves her shoulders in a cute way.)

771
00:28:00,459 --> 00:28:01,800
(Heavy shoulders)

772
00:28:01,800 --> 00:28:02,900
Lee Ha Nee!

773
00:28:02,929 --> 00:28:05,040
(Se Chan leaves Team Dance.)

774
00:28:05,769 --> 00:28:06,800
This is fun.

775
00:28:07,739 --> 00:28:09,810
(Her boldness explodes.)

776
00:28:09,810 --> 00:28:11,110
Let's go!

777
00:28:11,640 --> 00:28:12,909
(I can buy you anything.)

778
00:28:12,909 --> 00:28:14,209
I will!

779
00:28:14,209 --> 00:28:15,280
(Kwang Soo starts dancing.)

780
00:28:16,209 --> 00:28:19,179
(He has difficulty describing his feelings right now.)

781
00:28:19,179 --> 00:28:22,050
(His vigorous joint movements speak for them.)

782
00:28:22,820 --> 00:28:26,019
(This is what a trot song can do to you.)

783
00:28:26,590 --> 00:28:30,290
(Cute, sexy, and brave)

784
00:28:30,290 --> 00:28:32,729
(Daring woman Lee Ha Nee)

785
00:28:32,729 --> 00:28:33,900
Lee Ha Nee!

786
00:28:34,769 --> 00:28:36,300
(Will Ha Nee's performance affect the final result?)

787
00:28:36,300 --> 00:28:37,300
It was amazing.

788
00:28:37,300 --> 00:28:39,669
- Come on! - This is trot.

789
00:28:39,699 --> 00:28:42,070
- This is the power of trot. - Come on!

790
00:28:42,769 --> 00:28:45,540
(Proud)

791
00:28:45,840 --> 00:28:47,550
It's trot.

792
00:28:47,909 --> 00:28:49,110
This is trot.

793
00:28:49,110 --> 00:28:51,219
- It's trot. - I admit it.

794
00:28:51,219 --> 00:28:53,050
- I admit it. - Let's sing a dance song now.

795
00:28:53,050 --> 00:28:54,850
- Dong Hwi. - It's your song.

796
00:28:54,850 --> 00:28:57,019
This is it.

797
00:28:57,489 --> 00:28:58,489
Let's go!

798
00:28:58,489 --> 00:28:59,759
(Why did they give the microphone to Dong Hwi?)

799
00:29:00,590 --> 00:29:02,159
("Gimme Gimme" by Country Kko Kko)

800
00:29:03,030 --> 00:29:09,400
(Tak Jae Hoon of Country Kko Kko is a carbon copy of Dong Hwi.)

801
00:29:10,100 --> 00:29:12,600
(Team Dance warms up.)

802
00:29:12,840 --> 00:29:14,610
- Okay. - Seung Ryong.

803
00:29:14,709 --> 00:29:15,709
My back.

804
00:29:16,040 --> 00:29:18,509
- Here we go. - Let's go!

805
00:29:18,509 --> 00:29:19,509
(Let me dance.)

806
00:29:20,409 --> 00:29:22,179
(Flashy)

807
00:29:22,179 --> 00:29:23,780
(His flashy steps will definitely bring up the mood.)

808
00:29:23,780 --> 00:29:24,820
Look at that.

809
00:29:25,679 --> 00:29:29,419
(Show them the power of dance!)

810
00:29:30,120 --> 00:29:33,120
- He's amazing. - This is nice.

811
00:29:33,989 --> 00:29:35,090
There you go.

812
00:29:35,729 --> 00:29:36,830
Yes!

813
00:29:36,830 --> 00:29:39,360
- Look at him. - He is just like Jae Hoon.

814
00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:40,360
It's Tak Jae Hoon.

815
00:29:41,169 --> 00:29:42,330
It's perfect.

816
00:29:42,929 --> 00:29:45,269
(He is just like Tak Jae Hoon.)

817
00:29:45,739 --> 00:29:48,409
(Shocked)

818
00:29:48,769 --> 00:29:49,810
(A party needs a dance song.)

819
00:29:49,810 --> 00:29:51,140
Let's go!

820
00:29:52,739 --> 00:29:54,949
(Dong Hwi is sexy.)

821
00:29:55,179 --> 00:29:56,550
Here it comes.

822
00:29:56,550 --> 00:29:58,820
- Let's go! - Hands on shoulders.

823
00:29:59,580 --> 00:30:02,719
(Team Dance, are you ready?)

824
00:30:02,719 --> 00:30:04,419
(Let's dance together!)

825
00:30:04,419 --> 00:30:06,519
(They do the twist all together.)

826
00:30:06,519 --> 00:30:09,689
(This will make the majority vote for dance.)

827
00:30:09,689 --> 00:30:11,699
(Dancing)

828
00:30:12,429 --> 00:30:14,100
(Team Trot is having a meeting.)

829
00:30:14,530 --> 00:30:16,199
(We have to do something.)

830
00:30:16,199 --> 00:30:18,800
- Let's go! - Nice!

831
00:30:18,800 --> 00:30:21,540
(Team Trot will join Team Dance like destiny.)

832
00:30:22,570 --> 00:30:26,679
(Dong Hwi fought Ha Nee back with "Gimme Gimme".)

833
00:30:26,679 --> 00:30:27,909
Let's go!

834
00:30:28,009 --> 00:30:30,449
- Let's go, Team Trot! - Let's go!

835
00:30:30,709 --> 00:30:32,019
Let's go!

836
00:30:32,019 --> 00:30:33,120
Good!

837
00:30:33,749 --> 00:30:35,419
Nice!

838
00:30:35,620 --> 00:30:38,489
(Team Trot has Seok Jin...)

839
00:30:38,489 --> 00:30:41,530
(and Jin Sun Kyu, who looks just like Seok Jin.)

840
00:30:41,959 --> 00:30:43,989
(The trot twins will bring victory to the team.)

841
00:30:43,989 --> 00:30:45,300
Together!

842
00:30:45,300 --> 00:30:48,199
(Team Trot has to win!)

843
00:30:48,699 --> 00:30:51,900
(Call me when you need me)

844
00:30:51,900 --> 00:30:54,640
(I, who look just like you, will run to you)

845
00:30:55,239 --> 00:30:57,709
They might win.

846
00:30:57,880 --> 00:31:00,310
(As Team Trot is doing well,)

847
00:31:00,310 --> 00:31:01,780
(Seung Ryong changes teams.)

848
00:31:01,780 --> 00:31:03,810
- Together! - Let's go!

849
00:31:04,219 --> 00:31:06,179
(Singing)

850
00:31:06,179 --> 00:31:07,280
Jin Sun Kyu!

851
00:31:07,689 --> 00:31:09,419
(This is trot.)

852
00:31:09,989 --> 00:31:11,820
(It's pretty fun.)

853
00:31:12,560 --> 00:31:15,090
(We will run to victory.)

854
00:31:15,530 --> 00:31:17,259
(Trot is the best.)

855
00:31:17,259 --> 00:31:18,900
(It can't get more fun than this.)

856
00:31:18,900 --> 00:31:21,269
(We did a great job.)

857
00:31:21,269 --> 00:31:23,100
(The other team feels threatened.)

858
00:31:23,100 --> 00:31:26,499
(Team Trot seems to be winning.)

859
00:31:26,499 --> 00:31:29,009
- Trot! - Trot!

860
00:31:29,009 --> 00:31:31,610
- Trot! - Trot!

861
00:31:31,610 --> 00:31:33,280
Let's do this.

862
00:31:33,280 --> 00:31:35,209
Let's go.

863
00:31:35,209 --> 00:31:37,380
- We have to do this. - This is going to be crazy.

864
00:31:37,380 --> 00:31:38,620
- We have to. - Crazy.

865
00:31:39,179 --> 00:31:41,120
- You do the intro. - Okay.

866
00:31:41,120 --> 00:31:42,120
We have to put it on.

867
00:31:43,290 --> 00:31:46,290
("You in Vague Memory" by Hyun Jin Young)

868
00:31:47,360 --> 00:31:52,600
(The hoodie look is the key to this old Korean hip-hop dance song.)

869
00:31:52,600 --> 00:31:54,699
Put on the hood.

870
00:31:55,900 --> 00:31:58,699
You will have to join in.

871
00:31:58,699 --> 00:32:00,669
- Definitely. - Right.

872
00:32:00,669 --> 00:32:02,169
You will want to.

873
00:32:02,969 --> 00:32:04,810
(The light covers up my body)

874
00:32:04,810 --> 00:32:07,479
(They sing along.)

875
00:32:07,610 --> 00:32:09,009
It'll be hard not to sing along to this one.

876
00:32:10,280 --> 00:32:12,679
(They are done warming up.)

877
00:32:12,679 --> 00:32:13,919
Put on your hood!

878
00:32:14,449 --> 00:32:15,650
Let's go!

879
00:32:15,820 --> 00:32:17,320
(Disciplined movements...)

880
00:32:17,320 --> 00:32:19,519
(and rhythmic choreography are the key points.)

881
00:32:20,090 --> 00:32:23,159
(Perfectly...)

882
00:32:23,159 --> 00:32:25,199
(on...)

883
00:32:25,199 --> 00:32:26,729
(the beat)

884
00:32:27,969 --> 00:32:29,300
Let's go!

885
00:32:29,300 --> 00:32:31,199
(Who is this?)

886
00:32:31,199 --> 00:32:32,999
(Sun Kyu suddenly joins Team Trot.)

887
00:32:32,999 --> 00:32:33,999
Let's go!

888
00:32:34,199 --> 00:32:36,040
(Group hypnosis)

889
00:32:37,169 --> 00:32:38,610
What is Sun Kyu doing?

890
00:32:39,179 --> 00:32:40,679
Everyone is dancing.

891
00:32:40,679 --> 00:32:41,709
(Let me see.)

892
00:32:41,709 --> 00:32:43,409
(Even Team Trot is dancing.)

893
00:32:43,580 --> 00:32:44,580
Look at me!

894
00:32:44,580 --> 00:32:47,179
(It's too fun. Whatever.)

895
00:32:47,179 --> 00:32:49,120
(I'll just dance.)

896
00:32:49,120 --> 00:32:51,189
(The dance brings everyone together.)

897
00:32:52,590 --> 00:32:54,360
(This is why everyone loves dance songs.)

898
00:32:54,360 --> 00:32:55,360
Go!

899
00:32:55,360 --> 00:32:59,100
(My singing will bring up the mood even more.)

900
00:32:59,800 --> 00:33:01,630
(Team Trot is doomed.)

901
00:33:01,630 --> 00:33:02,630
Go!

902
00:33:03,300 --> 00:33:04,300
Haha.

903
00:33:04,300 --> 00:33:05,640
(He can't resist.)

904
00:33:05,640 --> 00:33:08,739
(Let me help you, So Min.)

905
00:33:09,370 --> 00:33:11,209
(Team Dance is the best.)

906
00:33:11,580 --> 00:33:13,310
(Frivolous)

907
00:33:14,110 --> 00:33:15,209
Jump!

908
00:33:15,209 --> 00:33:16,580
(Team Trot is being forgotten.)

909
00:33:17,650 --> 00:33:19,780
(We might lose.)

910
00:33:20,580 --> 00:33:22,050
Together!

911
00:33:22,050 --> 00:33:23,489
(Worried, Ji Hyo fights back.)

912
00:33:23,489 --> 00:33:25,419
(The "Love Battery" attack)

913
00:33:26,060 --> 00:33:28,390
(I might be leaning towards trot.)

914
00:33:29,229 --> 00:33:32,259
(Gong Myoung continues the attack with "Ddaeng Bul".)

915
00:33:32,259 --> 00:33:34,469
(Enjoy the dance as well.)

916
00:33:35,370 --> 00:33:37,769
(He sings at the top of his lungs.)

917
00:33:38,469 --> 00:33:40,840
(I might vote for trot after all.)

918
00:33:41,509 --> 00:33:42,769
(Team Trot has to win!)

919
00:33:42,769 --> 00:33:44,310
Team Trot wins!

920
00:33:44,310 --> 00:33:47,479
- I feel so happy today. - Sir, the first round is on you.

921
00:33:47,810 --> 00:33:49,509
- Let's go for another round. - No!

922
00:33:49,509 --> 00:33:51,219
Just go home.

923
00:33:51,219 --> 00:33:52,820
Go home after the first round.

924
00:33:52,820 --> 00:33:55,590
Director Ryu is still here too.

925
00:33:55,650 --> 00:33:58,560
- Ryu Seung Ryong! - Dance.

926
00:33:58,560 --> 00:33:59,689
(Seung Ryong will save his team with his dance song.)

927
00:33:59,689 --> 00:34:01,989
- Dance. - Let's go!

928
00:34:01,989 --> 00:34:03,159
(Seung Ryong will save his team with his dance song.)

929
00:34:03,390 --> 00:34:04,729
("Tarzan" by Yoon Do Hyun)

930
00:34:04,729 --> 00:34:05,759
Is this the song?

931
00:34:06,499 --> 00:34:08,699
(When I was little)

932
00:34:09,630 --> 00:34:11,699
(Director Ryu, you're amazing!)

933
00:34:11,699 --> 00:34:13,169
(Awkward)

934
00:34:13,900 --> 00:34:17,009
(I only had absurd dreams)

935
00:34:17,040 --> 00:34:19,310
Why are you not having fun?

936
00:34:19,780 --> 00:34:21,009
She is not having fun.

937
00:34:21,709 --> 00:34:22,780
They aren't either.

938
00:34:23,709 --> 00:34:25,019
No one is having fun.

939
00:34:25,019 --> 00:34:26,019
(Forced)

940
00:34:26,419 --> 00:34:28,019
(We're not having fun either.)

941
00:34:28,689 --> 00:34:31,060
(Only the director is having fun.)

942
00:34:31,820 --> 00:34:34,689
(This is why I love team dinners.)

943
00:34:35,330 --> 00:34:37,929
(Team Trot is chatting.)

944
00:34:37,929 --> 00:34:40,199
Hold on. I can't believe you guys.

945
00:34:40,199 --> 00:34:41,900
- Hey. - I'm sorry.

946
00:34:41,900 --> 00:34:43,469
- Hold on. - I'm sorry.

947
00:34:43,469 --> 00:34:45,039
How can you do this?

948
00:34:45,039 --> 00:34:46,999
Who is sleeping?

949
00:34:46,999 --> 00:34:49,369
Seung Ryong saw everything.

950
00:34:49,610 --> 00:34:51,309
Seung Ryong, but it was too boring.

951
00:34:51,309 --> 00:34:52,539
(I'm sorry, but it was boring.)

952
00:34:52,539 --> 00:34:53,910
(Even Manager Yu criticizes him.)

953
00:34:53,910 --> 00:34:55,280
- I mean... - Hold on.

954
00:34:55,280 --> 00:34:57,349
I've never heard a dance song this boring in my life.

955
00:34:57,610 --> 00:34:59,419
- Even I got bored. - I...

956
00:34:59,419 --> 00:35:01,619
(Team leaders should go home after the 1st round.)

957
00:35:01,990 --> 00:35:04,559
- Shall we take a vote? - It's really...

958
00:35:04,559 --> 00:35:06,019
I don't know anymore.

959
00:35:06,019 --> 00:35:09,289
I'm afraid we'll all choose trot.

960
00:35:09,289 --> 00:35:12,700
O for dance, X for trot.

961
00:35:12,760 --> 00:35:14,570
1, 2, 3.

962
00:35:14,570 --> 00:35:15,999
(The final decision)

963
00:35:16,729 --> 00:35:18,200
(In the 1st vote, the majority chose dance.)

964
00:35:18,200 --> 00:35:20,539
- It's dance. - No.

965
00:35:21,309 --> 00:35:22,910
2, 3.

966
00:35:23,769 --> 00:35:25,780
(Everyone chooses trot.)

967
00:35:25,780 --> 00:35:27,950
- What? - Are we unanimous?

968
00:35:28,010 --> 00:35:30,110
- We're unanimous. - Gosh.

969
00:35:30,479 --> 00:35:31,780
Trot was so fun.

970
00:35:31,780 --> 00:35:32,780
After singing it, we could see.

971
00:35:32,780 --> 00:35:34,919
Sadly, no one wins any points.

972
00:35:34,919 --> 00:35:36,619
Please hit the next person with the toy hammer.

973
00:35:36,619 --> 00:35:38,189
All right. Let's start from Haha.

974
00:35:38,189 --> 00:35:39,820
- Okay. - Here we go.

975
00:35:40,820 --> 00:35:42,059
Keep going.

976
00:35:43,430 --> 00:35:46,499
You have to hit harder than the person before you.

977
00:35:46,599 --> 00:35:48,970
If you don't hit hard...

978
00:35:50,030 --> 00:35:52,099
Don't worry. I've been hit many times.

979
00:35:52,099 --> 00:35:54,369
Are you sure? Will you be okay?

980
00:35:54,369 --> 00:35:56,209
Here?

981
00:35:56,209 --> 00:35:57,610
(Can I hit you here?)

982
00:35:57,939 --> 00:36:01,309
(Let me wake up the Wi Seong Rak inside me.)

983
00:36:02,180 --> 00:36:04,110
(If you're really okay...)

984
00:36:04,820 --> 00:36:05,820
Okay!

985
00:36:06,320 --> 00:36:07,950
(The Wi Seong Rak punch)

986
00:36:09,389 --> 00:36:12,059
(Oh, my. What did I do?)

987
00:36:12,619 --> 00:36:14,829
Her head went in a bit.

988
00:36:14,829 --> 00:36:16,889
- I'm sorry. - It's okay.

989
00:36:16,889 --> 00:36:19,200
- Are you okay? - It was...

990
00:36:19,200 --> 00:36:21,369
I'm okay. The thing is,

991
00:36:21,369 --> 00:36:23,369
it was a completely different kind of blow.

992
00:36:23,369 --> 00:36:24,769
Actors are different, right?

993
00:36:24,769 --> 00:36:26,470
- I mean... - It's Wi Seong Rak's blow.

994
00:36:26,470 --> 00:36:28,709
Usually, the top of your head hurts.

995
00:36:28,709 --> 00:36:31,610
But not this time. My teeth hurt instead.

996
00:36:31,610 --> 00:36:33,910
(My teeth hurt, not my head.)

997
00:36:33,910 --> 00:36:35,880
It means he's good.

998
00:36:36,050 --> 00:36:38,619
It went deep.

999
00:36:38,619 --> 00:36:39,820
- It did. - Yes.

1000
00:36:40,419 --> 00:36:41,820
Please do it properly.

1001
00:36:42,189 --> 00:36:43,419
Please do it properly.

1002
00:36:43,419 --> 00:36:44,419
(Thud)

1003
00:36:44,419 --> 00:36:46,059
- I'm sorry. - It's okay.

1004
00:36:46,059 --> 00:36:47,119
(I'm sorry.)

1005
00:36:47,119 --> 00:36:48,229
I'm sorry.

1006
00:36:48,990 --> 00:36:51,400
(Give as good as you get.)

1007
00:36:51,400 --> 00:36:53,999
(The love is passed down in the toy hammer relay.)

1008
00:36:54,360 --> 00:36:56,030
Jae Seok is pretty good.

1009
00:36:56,030 --> 00:36:57,729
Have you ever been hit with a toy hammer?

1010
00:36:57,729 --> 00:36:58,939
- Never. - Never?

1011
00:36:58,939 --> 00:37:00,869
I've been hit with a real hammer though.

1012
00:37:00,869 --> 00:37:03,209
(He wants to sound like a tough guy.)

1013
00:37:03,209 --> 00:37:04,510
(He might die after getting hit twice.)

1014
00:37:04,510 --> 00:37:06,079
A real hammer?

1015
00:37:06,079 --> 00:37:07,479
This is nothing then.

1016
00:37:08,209 --> 00:37:09,410
We're on a variety show.

1017
00:37:09,579 --> 00:37:10,709
Just look forward.

1018
00:37:10,809 --> 00:37:11,950
(He turns around.)

1019
00:37:12,050 --> 00:37:15,689
(Freaking out)

1020
00:37:15,689 --> 00:37:17,389
(It's only a toy hammer.)

1021
00:37:17,389 --> 00:37:19,419
- What's wrong? - Don't worry.

1022
00:37:19,590 --> 00:37:20,860
You're supposed to be a tough guy.

1023
00:37:20,860 --> 00:37:22,389
- Don't be like that. - Stop it.

1024
00:37:22,389 --> 00:37:23,660
It's so shameful.

1025
00:37:24,530 --> 00:37:26,400
Look at how manly your beard is.

1026
00:37:26,999 --> 00:37:28,729
I saw many people dodge once,

1027
00:37:28,729 --> 00:37:29,970
but he dodged three times.

1028
00:37:30,099 --> 00:37:31,669
Be charismatic, Seung Ryong.

1029
00:37:31,999 --> 00:37:33,470
You look great, Seung Ryong.

1030
00:37:33,470 --> 00:37:35,139
(Yes, I'll be charismatic.)

1031
00:37:35,139 --> 00:37:38,180
(Coward Seung Ryong comes back after getting hit.)

1032
00:37:38,180 --> 00:37:39,840
(He pumps charisma into him.)

1033
00:37:40,380 --> 00:37:41,709
Are you okay?

1034
00:37:42,079 --> 00:37:43,410
- Are you okay, Seung Ryong? - Is it my turn?

1035
00:37:43,410 --> 00:37:44,820
Aren't you a tough guy?

1036
00:37:44,820 --> 00:37:46,680
He hit with the opposite end.

1037
00:37:46,680 --> 00:37:47,849
Here comes the main part.

1038
00:37:47,849 --> 00:37:50,119
(Today's main event for toy hammer relay)

1039
00:37:50,119 --> 00:37:51,360
Here comes the main part.

1040
00:37:51,459 --> 00:37:53,419
- What's going on? - This is great.

1041
00:37:53,419 --> 00:37:55,030
(He climbs on his chair.)

1042
00:37:55,030 --> 00:37:56,630
- No. - You can do it.

1043
00:37:56,630 --> 00:37:58,599
- You can do it, Seung Ryong. - I'll pass it onto the next guy.

1044
00:37:58,599 --> 00:38:00,530
I'm worried you might hit me in the next round.

1045
00:38:02,300 --> 00:38:06,340
(Thud)

1046
00:38:07,070 --> 00:38:10,240
(We can feel the impact just by listening to its sound.)

1047
00:38:10,240 --> 00:38:12,180
That was hard.

1048
00:38:12,180 --> 00:38:13,780
(Jong Kook is red with anger.)

1049
00:38:13,840 --> 00:38:15,050
- Next is Kwang Soo. - Okay.

1050
00:38:15,050 --> 00:38:16,280
(He senses danger.)

1051
00:38:16,280 --> 00:38:17,450
It's over, Kwang Soo.

1052
00:38:17,450 --> 00:38:18,720
(Shuddering)

1053
00:38:18,720 --> 00:38:19,780
Okay.

1054
00:38:19,780 --> 00:38:22,650
(Okay!)

1055
00:38:23,349 --> 00:38:25,289
- It broke. - Okay.

1056
00:38:25,289 --> 00:38:27,459
(Will I also end up like that?)

1057
00:38:28,189 --> 00:38:30,630
- Did you see it? - The wave became much bigger.

1058
00:38:31,530 --> 00:38:32,829
Are you going up?

1059
00:38:32,829 --> 00:38:34,160
Yes, it's because...

1060
00:38:34,260 --> 00:38:36,400
- Seung Ryong went up. - That's right.

1061
00:38:36,630 --> 00:38:38,539
We should get first aid ready.

1062
00:38:39,099 --> 00:38:40,200
Is he allowed to do this?

1063
00:38:41,099 --> 00:38:42,269
Where are you going?

1064
00:38:42,910 --> 00:38:43,970
Do you want to come up too?

1065
00:38:43,970 --> 00:38:45,010
(Dragging)

1066
00:38:45,010 --> 00:38:47,079
(He climbs up on a chair as well.)

1067
00:38:47,079 --> 00:38:49,249
- We can stand on the chair, right? - Okay.

1068
00:38:50,809 --> 00:38:53,849
(Lifting up)

1069
00:38:54,119 --> 00:38:56,889
(I give back as much as I receive.)

1070
00:38:56,889 --> 00:38:58,260
He'll come down anyway.

1071
00:38:58,260 --> 00:38:59,990
- He might fall. - He came down.

1072
00:39:00,260 --> 00:39:01,389
Okay.

1073
00:39:01,389 --> 00:39:03,189
(I'm worried about Kwang Soo.)

1074
00:39:03,189 --> 00:39:04,700
I don't want to get hit.

1075
00:39:04,930 --> 00:39:05,999
Goodness.

1076
00:39:06,729 --> 00:39:09,070
(He aims at the target.)

1077
00:39:09,070 --> 00:39:11,769
(He hits with a toy hammer.)

1078
00:39:12,539 --> 00:39:14,200
- Thank you, everyone. - Okay.

1079
00:39:14,200 --> 00:39:15,570
(Thank you, everyone.)

1080
00:39:16,010 --> 00:39:18,340
(He wraps it up suddenly.)

1081
00:39:18,840 --> 00:39:20,979
(We should inverse the order now.)

1082
00:39:20,979 --> 00:39:23,280
If we start again, it won't end.

1083
00:39:23,749 --> 00:39:24,749
Do you want to continue?

1084
00:39:24,749 --> 00:39:27,119
- Did the wave end with me? - It did.

1085
00:39:27,180 --> 00:39:28,249
Okay.

1086
00:39:28,249 --> 00:39:29,720
The wave has to end at some point.

1087
00:39:29,720 --> 00:39:32,559
(Toy hammer relay ends by force.)

1088
00:39:32,720 --> 00:39:33,860
Let's play Race of Wits.

1089
00:39:33,860 --> 00:39:35,289
We'll stand up instead.

1090
00:39:35,289 --> 00:39:36,530
(Too many of their scores tied.)

1091
00:39:36,530 --> 00:39:39,760
(Those with the same score play Race of Wits.)

1092
00:39:39,760 --> 00:39:42,400
(People keep being eliminated.)

1093
00:39:42,630 --> 00:39:44,229
Okay, I'm the winner.

1094
00:39:44,229 --> 00:39:47,900
(The final winner is Jae Seok.)

1095
00:39:49,340 --> 00:39:51,110
I'll give you a hint that you want.

1096
00:39:51,110 --> 00:39:52,610
(Between a hint about thieves or police,)

1097
00:39:52,610 --> 00:39:54,110
(he may choose one.)

1098
00:39:54,880 --> 00:39:57,349
(He secretly asks for a hint.)

1099
00:39:57,349 --> 00:39:59,550
- He could be a thief asking. - Right.

1100
00:39:59,579 --> 00:40:00,749
If he's a thief,

1101
00:40:00,749 --> 00:40:02,550
- he'd ask for a hint about police. - Right.

1102
00:40:03,289 --> 00:40:04,320
I got it.

1103
00:40:04,320 --> 00:40:06,160
(Jae Seok chooses a hint.)

1104
00:40:06,559 --> 00:40:07,789
- Right? - Yes.

1105
00:40:08,260 --> 00:40:09,360
All right.

1106
00:40:09,459 --> 00:40:12,229
(Everyone watches him with curiosity.)

1107
00:40:12,229 --> 00:40:13,430
- Right? - Yes.

1108
00:40:13,860 --> 00:40:14,900
All right.

1109
00:40:14,900 --> 00:40:17,430
(He finally gets a hint.)

1110
00:40:18,340 --> 00:40:20,539
(If the hint is about the police,)

1111
00:40:20,539 --> 00:40:22,840
(it's likely that Jae Seok is a thief.)

1112
00:40:22,840 --> 00:40:25,610
(What is Jae Seok's identity?)

1113
00:40:25,840 --> 00:40:27,280
(He picks a hint about the police.)

1114
00:40:27,280 --> 00:40:28,749
(The police uses his real name.)

1115
00:40:28,809 --> 00:40:30,579
Here's a hint about the police that you asked for.

1116
00:40:30,709 --> 00:40:31,820
Okay.

1117
00:40:31,820 --> 00:40:35,419
(Jae Seok is a thief.)

1118
00:40:36,650 --> 00:40:37,650
Two of you are...

1119
00:40:37,919 --> 00:40:39,919
level thieves today.

1120
00:40:40,360 --> 00:40:42,289
Why do you always assign us as thieves?

1121
00:40:42,559 --> 00:40:44,260
Why do you always pick us?

1122
00:40:44,260 --> 00:40:46,200
(Yu Jae Seok is a level thief.)

1123
00:40:46,900 --> 00:40:47,959
Goodness.

1124
00:40:47,959 --> 00:40:51,030
(The police officer doesn't go by his or her stage name.)

1125
00:40:51,229 --> 00:40:54,240
(Who are the guests that use their real name?)

1126
00:40:54,240 --> 00:40:58,240
(It's 1 of these 4.)

1127
00:40:58,240 --> 00:41:00,039
- What is it? - He's thinking a lot,

1128
00:41:00,510 --> 00:41:01,510
so I think he's a citizen.

1129
00:41:01,650 --> 00:41:02,749
I don't think he's a thief.

1130
00:41:03,650 --> 00:41:05,119
All right.

1131
00:41:05,950 --> 00:41:09,590
(Thief Jae Seok narrows down the candidates for the police.)

1132
00:41:09,919 --> 00:41:13,789
(Divide into 2 groups and get in the car.)

1133
00:41:13,820 --> 00:41:15,329
In this car,

1134
00:41:15,329 --> 00:41:17,229
- there's a culprit. - Definitely.

1135
00:41:17,360 --> 00:41:18,999
- There's more than one. - There's more than one.

1136
00:41:19,300 --> 00:41:21,059
(She turns around.)

1137
00:41:22,530 --> 00:41:24,130
(Is it you?)

1138
00:41:24,130 --> 00:41:26,539
(I'm definitely not it. I'm a newcomer.)

1139
00:41:26,740 --> 00:41:29,840
I heard what Sun Kyu mumbled to himself.

1140
00:41:29,840 --> 00:41:33,610
(I heard what Sun Kyu mumbled to himself.)

1141
00:41:33,610 --> 00:41:35,309
- What did he say? - He said...

1142
00:41:35,550 --> 00:41:37,510
He said, "I'm bad at things like this."

1143
00:41:37,510 --> 00:41:38,680
I heard him say it.

1144
00:41:38,680 --> 00:41:40,680
They didn't give me any special instructions.

1145
00:41:40,680 --> 00:41:42,650
That's why I asked him a while go.

1146
00:41:42,650 --> 00:41:44,050
When did they tell you that?

1147
00:41:44,650 --> 00:41:46,619
Those who come early usually get the mission.

1148
00:41:46,619 --> 00:41:47,860
- That's usually the case. - He came the earliest.

1149
00:41:47,919 --> 00:41:49,789
- He did. - Then I arrived.

1150
00:41:50,459 --> 00:41:53,059
As you know, the shoot was delayed.

1151
00:41:53,200 --> 00:41:55,070
- Later... - I think I know.

1152
00:41:55,070 --> 00:41:58,240
- Dong Hwi is strange. - Dong Hwi.

1153
00:41:58,340 --> 00:42:00,740
He keeps cornering Sun Kyu.

1154
00:42:00,740 --> 00:42:02,439
- He does. - I see.

1155
00:42:02,439 --> 00:42:04,880
It's a habit of inexperienced criminals.

1156
00:42:05,010 --> 00:42:07,539
I don't think he's someone outgoing and talkative.

1157
00:42:07,539 --> 00:42:09,849
But he keeps cornering Sun Kyu.

1158
00:42:09,849 --> 00:42:11,950
I've always been strange.

1159
00:42:11,950 --> 00:42:13,249
No, Dong Hwi.

1160
00:42:13,249 --> 00:42:14,450
He feels cornered.

1161
00:42:14,450 --> 00:42:16,150
He must be very flustered.

1162
00:42:16,150 --> 00:42:17,950
(Is one of them a forger?)

1163
00:42:18,590 --> 00:42:20,220
We must get hints no matter what.

1164
00:42:20,360 --> 00:42:21,419
Yes, we should.

1165
00:42:21,419 --> 00:42:23,289
It's impossible without hints.

1166
00:42:23,289 --> 00:42:24,860
- What's the hint, Jae Seok? - Share it with us.

1167
00:42:24,860 --> 00:42:26,099
- Please. - It's too exposing.

1168
00:42:26,200 --> 00:42:27,860
As I said, if I share it,

1169
00:42:27,860 --> 00:42:30,570
- you might think I'm a thief. - Right.

1170
00:42:30,769 --> 00:42:32,269
It could be one of us,

1171
00:42:32,939 --> 00:42:34,039
so I can't.

1172
00:42:34,169 --> 00:42:37,309
- The first hint is too general. - Right.

1173
00:42:37,309 --> 00:42:39,010
- That's why. - Okay.

1174
00:42:39,010 --> 00:42:40,079
(He lets it slide.)

1175
00:42:40,079 --> 00:42:42,079
I bet Gong Myoung is a citizen no matter what.

1176
00:42:42,079 --> 00:42:43,249
It seems that way based on his face.

1177
00:42:43,249 --> 00:42:45,820
(It seems that way based on his face.)

1178
00:42:45,820 --> 00:42:46,919
He's definitely a citizen.

1179
00:42:46,919 --> 00:42:48,720
(His face looks that of a citizen.)

1180
00:42:48,720 --> 00:42:53,260
(I believe your face, Myoung.)

1181
00:42:53,260 --> 00:42:56,090
My goodness, So Min.

1182
00:42:56,090 --> 00:42:57,660
Seriously.

1183
00:42:57,860 --> 00:43:00,059
I'd love to have a son like him.

1184
00:43:00,200 --> 00:43:01,900
Come on.

1185
00:43:02,369 --> 00:43:04,229
He doesn't have the face of a forger.

1186
00:43:04,229 --> 00:43:05,900
- It's impossible. - His face?

1187
00:43:05,970 --> 00:43:07,470
Who has the face of a criminal?

1188
00:43:07,470 --> 00:43:09,010
(Who has the face of a criminal?)

1189
00:43:09,010 --> 00:43:11,340
You know what? Seung Ryong...

1190
00:43:11,340 --> 00:43:12,410
(She answers immediately.)

1191
00:43:12,410 --> 00:43:13,979
I'm sorry to say this,

1192
00:43:14,110 --> 00:43:17,349
but he has the look of a forger.

1193
00:43:17,349 --> 00:43:20,579
(He's already been proven guilty according to his face.)

1194
00:43:20,579 --> 00:43:23,550
I think he's either the police or the forger.

1195
00:43:23,550 --> 00:43:24,849
- He's one of them. - You fit the character.

1196
00:43:24,849 --> 00:43:25,990
You really do.

1197
00:43:25,990 --> 00:43:27,160
I don't understand...

1198
00:43:27,160 --> 00:43:29,289
what everyone is saying. It's my first time here.

1199
00:43:29,930 --> 00:43:32,729
Isn't it strange that he keeps smiling?

1200
00:43:33,099 --> 00:43:34,800
More importantly,

1201
00:43:34,800 --> 00:43:36,900
my team works so well as a team.

1202
00:43:37,829 --> 00:43:40,340
Our identities will be revealed later, right?

1203
00:43:40,340 --> 00:43:43,340
- I think I'll be extremely shocked. - Right.

1204
00:43:43,939 --> 00:43:46,410
(We'll leave Seung Ryong's worries behind for now.)

1205
00:43:46,939 --> 00:43:49,450
(Team Seung Ryong arrives at the restaurant.)

1206
00:43:49,450 --> 00:43:50,950
The smell is unbearable.

1207
00:43:50,950 --> 00:43:52,720
Everyone, here's a mission...

1208
00:43:53,220 --> 00:43:54,880
with a chance to win hints and meal cards.

1209
00:43:56,689 --> 00:43:58,590
It's Ultimate Cham Cham Cham.

1210
00:43:58,590 --> 00:44:00,059
(Ultimate Cham Cham Cham)

1211
00:44:00,919 --> 00:44:02,260
Based on the result of Cham Cham Cham,

1212
00:44:02,260 --> 00:44:03,860
if the offense is successful, you win.

1213
00:44:03,959 --> 00:44:06,200
The final winner of a tournament wins...

1214
00:44:06,200 --> 00:44:08,869
a meal card and a hint.

1215
00:44:08,869 --> 00:44:10,530
(The final winner gets a meal card and a hint.)

1216
00:44:10,570 --> 00:44:13,769
(Tournament matches)

1217
00:44:13,900 --> 00:44:15,439
This will be easy.

1218
00:44:15,439 --> 00:44:17,309
(Kwang Soo versus Jae Seok)

1219
00:44:17,470 --> 00:44:19,740
- Let's go. - You can do it.

1220
00:44:20,209 --> 00:44:22,709
- Seriously. - It's a big match.

1221
00:44:22,880 --> 00:44:24,709
I don't want to lose against him.

1222
00:44:25,320 --> 00:44:27,519
I wanted to play against him.

1223
00:44:27,849 --> 00:44:28,849
Okay.

1224
00:44:29,689 --> 00:44:31,519
Here we go. Get ready.

1225
00:44:32,289 --> 00:44:33,389
Start.

1226
00:44:33,389 --> 00:44:34,459
- Rock-paper-scissors. - Rock-paper-scissors.

1227
00:44:35,459 --> 00:44:36,530
Rock-paper-scissors.

1228
00:44:36,630 --> 00:44:39,130
(Kwang Soo gets to attack first.)

1229
00:44:39,130 --> 00:44:40,999
(What's going on?)

1230
00:44:42,229 --> 00:44:45,099
(He hits with the toy hammer.)

1231
00:44:45,099 --> 00:44:46,139
(What's going on?)

1232
00:44:46,139 --> 00:44:47,200
What are you doing?

1233
00:44:47,369 --> 00:44:49,209
- You should play Cham Cham Cham. - Play Cham Cham Cham.

1234
00:44:49,209 --> 00:44:50,309
Kwang Soo.

1235
00:44:50,410 --> 00:44:53,110
Listen, I'll explain. Play rock-paper-scissors.

1236
00:44:53,110 --> 00:44:54,380
- I'm sorry. - Then...

1237
00:44:54,410 --> 00:44:56,349
play Cham Cham Cham.

1238
00:44:56,510 --> 00:44:57,680
(Laughing)

1239
00:44:57,680 --> 00:44:59,349
Why did they play rock-paper-scissors?

1240
00:44:59,479 --> 00:45:00,749
I don't understand.

1241
00:45:01,380 --> 00:45:02,889
This is very upsetting.

1242
00:45:03,419 --> 00:45:04,820
We should play Cham Cham Cham.

1243
00:45:05,320 --> 00:45:06,389
Okay.

1244
00:45:07,289 --> 00:45:09,030
Here we go. Get ready.

1245
00:45:10,189 --> 00:45:11,289
- Rock-paper-scissors. - Rock-paper-scissors.

1246
00:45:11,459 --> 00:45:13,630
(Jae Seok gets to attack.)

1247
00:45:13,630 --> 00:45:14,660
I told you.

1248
00:45:15,300 --> 00:45:16,470
This is upsetting.

1249
00:45:16,470 --> 00:45:17,900
- I should've played something else. - You get one chance.

1250
00:45:19,599 --> 00:45:21,639
(I need to calm down.)

1251
00:45:21,639 --> 00:45:23,169
Jae Seok is very nervous.

1252
00:45:23,169 --> 00:45:24,439
He is.

1253
00:45:25,439 --> 00:45:26,479
Cham, Cham, Cham.

1254
00:45:26,610 --> 00:45:29,280
(Jae Seok fails to attack.)

1255
00:45:29,550 --> 00:45:31,209
- He didn't turn. - Did he turn?

1256
00:45:31,249 --> 00:45:32,280
Cham, Cham, Cham.

1257
00:45:33,419 --> 00:45:36,090
(I'll hit him first.)

1258
00:45:36,090 --> 00:45:37,950
- Did he turn the same way? - No, he didn't.

1259
00:45:37,950 --> 00:45:39,119
(He definitely failed during Cham, Cham, Cham.)

1260
00:45:39,119 --> 00:45:40,189
What happened, Jae Seok?

1261
00:45:40,189 --> 00:45:41,360
(Seung Ryong learns how to play dirty.)

1262
00:45:41,360 --> 00:45:42,430
Did he turn?

1263
00:45:42,430 --> 00:45:43,789
(The bigger rule breaker catches the rule breaker.)

1264
00:45:43,789 --> 00:45:44,829
I won.

1265
00:45:44,829 --> 00:45:45,900
Did he turn the same way?

1266
00:45:45,900 --> 00:45:46,930
- He didn't. - He didn't.

1267
00:45:46,930 --> 00:45:48,059
Do you win if you lie like this?

1268
00:45:48,059 --> 00:45:49,300
No.

1269
00:45:49,300 --> 00:45:51,200
(Do you win if you lie like this?)

1270
00:45:51,200 --> 00:45:52,700
You shouldn't learn from him.

1271
00:45:52,700 --> 00:45:54,240
- This doesn't count. - Don't learn from him.

1272
00:45:54,240 --> 00:45:55,539
He was joking.

1273
00:45:55,539 --> 00:45:57,470
We're veteran members.

1274
00:45:59,209 --> 00:46:01,979
- Jae Seok is quite flustered. - He's very flustered.

1275
00:46:02,010 --> 00:46:03,280
- He's very flustered. - Okay.

1276
00:46:03,309 --> 00:46:04,479
The score is 1 to 1.

1277
00:46:04,579 --> 00:46:06,919
- Okay, here's our last round. - It's 1 to 1.

1278
00:46:07,249 --> 00:46:08,320
Play rock-paper-scissors.

1279
00:46:08,320 --> 00:46:10,749
(This round will determine the real winner.)

1280
00:46:11,119 --> 00:46:13,689
(Jae Seok gets to attack.)

1281
00:46:13,919 --> 00:46:15,160
Cham, Cham, Cham.

1282
00:46:15,160 --> 00:46:17,329
(Kwang Soo turns toward Jae Seok's hand.)

1283
00:46:17,329 --> 00:46:19,729
(If he successfully attacks him, Jae Seok wins.)

1284
00:46:19,729 --> 00:46:22,869
(Is Jae Seok grabbing the pot?)

1285
00:46:23,930 --> 00:46:26,269
(He holds down the pot and attacks with the hammer.)

1286
00:46:26,269 --> 00:46:27,439
Just hit him.

1287
00:46:27,439 --> 00:46:29,639
Just hit his head.

1288
00:46:30,269 --> 00:46:31,309
(It's a dirty mess.)

1289
00:46:31,309 --> 00:46:32,410
Hit his shoulder.

1290
00:46:32,410 --> 00:46:33,610
(It's a dirty mess.)

1291
00:46:33,610 --> 00:46:39,119
(It's a demonstration of a dirty play.)

1292
00:46:40,380 --> 00:46:44,689
(They're too old for such nonsense.)

1293
00:46:44,689 --> 00:46:47,160
(Thud)

1294
00:46:47,160 --> 00:46:48,419
Game is over.

1295
00:46:48,789 --> 00:46:49,829
Kwang Soo lost.

1296
00:46:49,829 --> 00:46:51,559
(He's tattered.)

1297
00:46:51,559 --> 00:46:52,930
(He's the best in playing dirty.)

1298
00:46:52,930 --> 00:46:54,729
You should've been quicker to reach for the pot.

1299
00:46:55,269 --> 00:46:57,530
(You're amazing, Jae Seok.)

1300
00:46:57,530 --> 00:46:58,639
It was meaningful.

1301
00:46:59,300 --> 00:47:00,340
It was a great game.

1302
00:47:00,340 --> 00:47:02,869
(It was a great demonstration of how one can play dirty.)

1303
00:47:04,169 --> 00:47:06,340
Gosh, it's so irritating.

1304
00:47:06,610 --> 00:47:08,610
(He understands how Running Man works.)

1305
00:47:08,610 --> 00:47:09,680
Here we go.

1306
00:47:10,550 --> 00:47:11,849
Rock-paper-scissors.

1307
00:47:11,849 --> 00:47:13,150
(So Min versus Myoung)

1308
00:47:15,220 --> 00:47:17,119
I'm nervous. Why am I so nervous?

1309
00:47:17,749 --> 00:47:19,320
Why are you nervous?

1310
00:47:19,320 --> 00:47:20,959
(Why are you nervous?)

1311
00:47:20,959 --> 00:47:23,760
(Why are you nervous, Myoung?)

1312
00:47:23,760 --> 00:47:25,260
(Embarrassed and flustered)

1313
00:47:25,260 --> 00:47:27,300
Wait, are you on a date?

1314
00:47:27,300 --> 00:47:29,729
- What are they doing? - What are you doing?

1315
00:47:29,729 --> 00:47:31,530
- Just play rock-paper-scissors. - What?

1316
00:47:31,530 --> 00:47:32,639
Wait a minute.

1317
00:47:32,639 --> 00:47:34,539
"Why are you nervous?"

1318
00:47:34,539 --> 00:47:35,639
What's going on?

1319
00:47:35,639 --> 00:47:36,970
He said that he's nervous.

1320
00:47:36,970 --> 00:47:38,809
He keeps saying that he is.

1321
00:47:38,809 --> 00:47:39,880
(Myoung says that he feels nervous in front of me.)

1322
00:47:39,880 --> 00:47:42,209
(It must be good to be young.)

1323
00:47:42,209 --> 00:47:43,550
Start.

1324
00:47:44,150 --> 00:47:45,180
Cham, Cham, Cham.

1325
00:47:45,180 --> 00:47:47,450
(Myoung gets to attack.)

1326
00:47:47,450 --> 00:47:48,849
Why couldn't I grab it?

1327
00:47:48,849 --> 00:47:51,919
(He misses the toy hammer.)

1328
00:47:51,919 --> 00:47:53,019
Cham, Cham, Cham.

1329
00:47:53,320 --> 00:47:57,030
(Myoung makes a mistake with the toy hammer.)

1330
00:47:57,030 --> 00:47:58,700
(What's going on here?)

1331
00:47:58,700 --> 00:48:00,130
Myoung couldn't grab it.

1332
00:48:00,130 --> 00:48:02,430
- Myoung. - He's rather shy.

1333
00:48:02,669 --> 00:48:04,169
Are you going easy on her?

1334
00:48:04,169 --> 00:48:05,499
(Are you going easy on So Min?)

1335
00:48:05,499 --> 00:48:06,999
Are you going easy on me?

1336
00:48:06,999 --> 00:48:08,639
- Or... - I'm sure of it.

1337
00:48:08,639 --> 00:48:09,939
He could have finished it.

1338
00:48:09,939 --> 00:48:12,110
- It'd be finished already. - Is he going easy on her?

1339
00:48:12,439 --> 00:48:14,939
I think he's going easy on me.

1340
00:48:16,180 --> 00:48:18,619
(Look at these two.)

1341
00:48:19,380 --> 00:48:20,550
Rock-paper-scissors.

1342
00:48:20,550 --> 00:48:22,349
(They start to play seriously.)

1343
00:48:22,349 --> 00:48:23,689
Cham, Cham, Cham.

1344
00:48:24,689 --> 00:48:25,689
Rock-paper-scissors.

1345
00:48:25,689 --> 00:48:27,160
(Myoung gets to attack.)

1346
00:48:27,160 --> 00:48:28,220
Cham, Cham, Cham.

1347
00:48:28,490 --> 00:48:30,030
(Thud)

1348
00:48:30,289 --> 00:48:32,459
Myoung doesn't go easy on others during games.

1349
00:48:32,459 --> 00:48:33,530
Rock-paper-scissors.

1350
00:48:33,530 --> 00:48:34,559
Cham, Cham, Cham.

1351
00:48:34,559 --> 00:48:36,400
(Thud)

1352
00:48:36,400 --> 00:48:38,740
(Hold on. Myoung?)

1353
00:48:38,740 --> 00:48:40,039
Myoung is quick.

1354
00:48:41,070 --> 00:48:44,110
(Myoung is no longer suspected.)

1355
00:48:44,110 --> 00:48:45,780
He doesn't go easy.

1356
00:48:45,780 --> 00:48:47,039
He doesn't.

1357
00:48:47,039 --> 00:48:48,380
Why didn't you go easy on me?

1358
00:48:48,380 --> 00:48:49,410
(Goodness)

1359
00:48:49,410 --> 00:48:51,510
- It really hurt. - It's a game after all, So Min.

1360
00:48:51,510 --> 00:48:52,680
Myoung is quick.

1361
00:48:52,680 --> 00:48:54,579
I'm okay.

1362
00:48:54,579 --> 00:48:55,849
Myoung is quick.

1363
00:48:55,849 --> 00:48:58,389
Wait, hit me one more time and hug me.

1364
00:48:58,389 --> 00:49:01,490
(Will you hit me one more time and hug me?)

1365
00:49:01,820 --> 00:49:02,930
(I already lost, so I'll win something else.)

1366
00:49:02,930 --> 00:49:05,329
What are you doing?

1367
00:49:05,530 --> 00:49:07,329
What are you talking about?

1368
00:49:07,760 --> 00:49:09,130
It didn't hurt.

1369
00:49:09,729 --> 00:49:10,900
It didn't hurt.

1370
00:49:12,439 --> 00:49:13,599
(Seung Ryong versus...)

1371
00:49:13,599 --> 00:49:14,740
We met for the first time today.

1372
00:49:14,740 --> 00:49:15,840
We did.

1373
00:49:15,840 --> 00:49:17,939
It's best to play when we don't know each other.

1374
00:49:17,939 --> 00:49:19,840
- Let's see. - Don't hit with the pot.

1375
00:49:20,380 --> 00:49:21,709
Don't hit with the pot.

1376
00:49:22,249 --> 00:49:23,610
Next is Seung Ryong.

1377
00:49:24,249 --> 00:49:25,349
- Rock-paper-scissors. - Rock-paper-scissors.

1378
00:49:25,349 --> 00:49:27,349
(Se Chan gets to attack.)

1379
00:49:27,349 --> 00:49:28,689
(He leans forward.)

1380
00:49:29,720 --> 00:49:31,889
(He pushes out his face.)

1381
00:49:32,619 --> 00:49:34,590
(Seung Ryong is so cute.)

1382
00:49:34,590 --> 00:49:35,590
Cham, Cham, Cham.

1383
00:49:35,590 --> 00:49:37,760
(Bumping)

1384
00:49:39,099 --> 00:49:40,160
Cham, Cham, Cham.

1385
00:49:41,260 --> 00:49:42,369
(He hits his own face with the pot.)

1386
00:49:42,369 --> 00:49:43,729
Are you okay?

1387
00:49:43,999 --> 00:49:45,999
(Poor Seung Ryong.)

1388
00:49:47,070 --> 00:49:48,169
(He attacks himself with the shield.)

1389
00:49:48,169 --> 00:49:49,340
Are you okay?

1390
00:49:49,340 --> 00:49:50,510
- Oh, no. - Are you okay?

1391
00:49:50,510 --> 00:49:51,610
- Oh, no. - Are you okay?

1392
00:49:51,769 --> 00:49:53,240
Are you all right?

1393
00:49:53,240 --> 00:49:56,110
I never saw this happen during Cham, Cham, Cham.

1394
00:49:56,110 --> 00:49:57,510
(Hang in there, Seung Ryong.)

1395
00:49:57,510 --> 00:49:59,720
- I thought it was serious. - Get used to it, Seung Ryong.

1396
00:49:59,720 --> 00:50:01,320
I'm a little dizzy.

1397
00:50:01,320 --> 00:50:02,419
- Rock-paper-scissors. - Rock-paper-scissors.

1398
00:50:02,419 --> 00:50:04,519
(Se Chan gets to attack again.)

1399
00:50:04,519 --> 00:50:05,619
Cham, Cham, Cham.

1400
00:50:06,490 --> 00:50:08,930
(He turns towards Se Chan's hand.)

1401
00:50:08,930 --> 00:50:11,689
(If Seung Ryong doesn't block him, Se Chan wins.)

1402
00:50:11,689 --> 00:50:14,630
(Squeak)

1403
00:50:15,470 --> 00:50:16,530
Cham, Cham, Cham.

1404
00:50:16,900 --> 00:50:19,539
(His head lowers due to the impact.)

1405
00:50:19,840 --> 00:50:21,470
Oh, no.

1406
00:50:21,470 --> 00:50:22,840
- Why did you stand still? - Seung Ryong.

1407
00:50:22,840 --> 00:50:24,169
Why did you stand still?

1408
00:50:24,269 --> 00:50:26,539
He stood still for me to hit him.

1409
00:50:26,539 --> 00:50:28,639
(He gets hit by the pot and the toy hammer.)

1410
00:50:30,749 --> 00:50:31,979
It was a great game.

1411
00:50:31,979 --> 00:50:33,180
(Se Chan moves up to the final round.)

1412
00:50:33,720 --> 00:50:35,220
Are you okay, Seung Ryong?

1413
00:50:35,849 --> 00:50:37,919
(Variety shows are difficult.)

1414
00:50:38,119 --> 00:50:39,160
Cham, Cham, Cham.

1415
00:50:39,160 --> 00:50:40,760
(Cham, Cham, Cham semifinal continues.)

1416
00:50:41,419 --> 00:50:43,760
(As soon as they start, he hits with the toy hammer.)

1417
00:50:44,130 --> 00:50:46,160
- Myoung is quick. - Who lost?

1418
00:50:46,160 --> 00:50:47,200
Here's the final round.

1419
00:50:47,729 --> 00:50:49,829
- I have to win this. - He's quick.

1420
00:50:49,829 --> 00:50:50,970
Cham, Cham, Cham.

1421
00:50:51,269 --> 00:50:55,070
(With the snap of his wrist, the game is over.)

1422
00:50:55,070 --> 00:50:56,570
He's so quick.

1423
00:50:56,570 --> 00:50:58,369
(Myoung is undefeated during Cham, Cham, Cham.)

1424
00:50:58,369 --> 00:50:59,639
I knew it.

1425
00:50:59,639 --> 00:51:00,939
(Myoung gets a hint.)

1426
00:51:01,680 --> 00:51:02,849
(Team Ha Nee arrives at the restaurant.)

1427
00:51:02,849 --> 00:51:04,479
The smell is amazing.

1428
00:51:04,479 --> 00:51:05,650
It smells like jeon.

1429
00:51:05,650 --> 00:51:08,180
Your mission here is...

1430
00:51:09,019 --> 00:51:11,019
Leg Split.

1431
00:51:12,320 --> 00:51:15,459
The loser of rock-paper-scissors spreads his legs.

1432
00:51:15,590 --> 00:51:18,030
You lose when you can no longer spread your legs.

1433
00:51:18,229 --> 00:51:20,459
The final winner of the tournament...

1434
00:51:20,459 --> 00:51:23,229
wins a meal card and a hint.

1435
00:51:23,229 --> 00:51:24,800
(The final winner wins a meal card and a hint.)

1436
00:51:24,930 --> 00:51:26,840
We're doomed.

1437
00:51:26,840 --> 00:51:27,970
(Ha Nee versus Jong Kook)

1438
00:51:27,970 --> 00:51:30,240
Isn't Jong Kook very flexible?

1439
00:51:30,709 --> 00:51:32,579
- No. - Not as much as you think.

1440
00:51:32,709 --> 00:51:35,039
- Your legs are so long. - No.

1441
00:51:35,849 --> 00:51:37,380
Her legs are really long.

1442
00:51:37,380 --> 00:51:38,849
(We expect Jong Kook to struggle against Ha Nee.)

1443
00:51:39,349 --> 00:51:40,419
Jong Kook.

1444
00:51:40,419 --> 00:51:41,820
Her legs are long too.

1445
00:51:41,820 --> 00:51:44,450
(I'm quite flexible too.)

1446
00:51:45,590 --> 00:51:46,789
My legs.

1447
00:51:46,789 --> 00:51:48,119
Look at him.

1448
00:51:48,119 --> 00:51:51,229
You can't win just because you can split your legs.

1449
00:51:51,229 --> 00:51:53,160
(Spreading wide)

1450
00:51:54,360 --> 00:51:55,530
(During the warm-up,)

1451
00:51:55,530 --> 00:51:58,669
(she dominates him successfully.)

1452
00:51:59,539 --> 00:52:01,639
(Gaping)

1453
00:52:01,639 --> 00:52:05,410
(How is that possible?)

1454
00:52:06,280 --> 00:52:10,079
(He almost tears his muscles while trying to copy Ha Nee.)

1455
00:52:10,650 --> 00:52:13,119
Even if I can do it...

1456
00:52:13,119 --> 00:52:16,419
It doesn't matter if I lose rock-paper-scissors.

1457
00:52:16,419 --> 00:52:18,820
(Winning rock-paper-scissors is more important.)

1458
00:52:19,220 --> 00:52:20,419
Go a little farther.

1459
00:52:20,419 --> 00:52:21,889
- Jong Kook. - I think it's over.

1460
00:52:22,019 --> 00:52:23,630
- Rock-paper-scissors. - Rock-paper-scissors.

1461
00:52:23,630 --> 00:52:25,599
(Rock-paper-scissors)

1462
00:52:25,800 --> 00:52:30,499
(I can't go any farther.)

1463
00:52:31,400 --> 00:52:32,970
If he had won...

1464
00:52:33,900 --> 00:52:36,309
(Sun Kyu is her rival in acrobatics.)

1465
00:52:36,309 --> 00:52:37,470
Okay.

1466
00:52:37,470 --> 00:52:38,740
This is the final round.

1467
00:52:38,740 --> 00:52:40,979
- It's the final round. - It's the last.

1468
00:52:41,639 --> 00:52:45,110
(She barely reaches his toe, and Sun Kyu is nervous.)

1469
00:52:45,110 --> 00:52:46,579
Rock-paper-scissors.

1470
00:52:46,579 --> 00:52:49,289
(Their fate depends on this round.)

1471
00:52:50,050 --> 00:52:53,959
(Screaming)

1472
00:52:54,059 --> 00:52:55,459
Good job.

1473
00:52:55,630 --> 00:52:57,090
That's it.

1474
00:52:57,459 --> 00:52:59,660
It's about Han Ki Beom's height.

1475
00:53:00,260 --> 00:53:02,570
(Sun Kyu, can you do it?)

1476
00:53:02,829 --> 00:53:03,900
Let's see.

1477
00:53:04,269 --> 00:53:06,470
He might be able to do it.

1478
00:53:07,840 --> 00:53:10,209
- Okay, stop there. - It's as far as I can go.

1479
00:53:10,539 --> 00:53:12,039
Here he comes.

1480
00:53:12,240 --> 00:53:13,309
Did he reach?

1481
00:53:13,309 --> 00:53:14,410
He reached.

1482
00:53:14,410 --> 00:53:15,579
(His legs are split straight.)

1483
00:53:15,579 --> 00:53:16,849
He's so good.

1484
00:53:17,110 --> 00:53:18,650
- Be careful. - Did he reach?

1485
00:53:18,979 --> 00:53:20,550
- He reached. - Get longer.

1486
00:53:20,550 --> 00:53:22,220
(Will Sun Kyu succeed?)

1487
00:53:22,220 --> 00:53:23,519
He can stretch far.

1488
00:53:23,519 --> 00:53:25,289
- Seriously. - Be careful.

1489
00:53:25,289 --> 00:53:26,459
I lost.

1490
00:53:26,459 --> 00:53:29,229
(I lost.)

1491
00:53:29,229 --> 00:53:30,889
Okay, Ha Nee wins.

1492
00:53:31,289 --> 00:53:32,729
She's the winner.

1493
00:53:32,729 --> 00:53:34,160
It's what we expected.

1494
00:53:35,300 --> 00:53:37,200
- You know about Ha Nee, right? - She must be the forger.

1495
00:53:37,200 --> 00:53:39,970
- There's a forger? - We're watching you.

1496
00:53:40,269 --> 00:53:41,499
I have no idea.

1497
00:53:41,499 --> 00:53:42,510
(What kind of hint will it be?)

1498
00:53:42,510 --> 00:53:44,139
I'm watching you from the back.

1499
00:53:44,970 --> 00:53:48,579
(Ha Nee gets a hint.)

1500
00:53:48,579 --> 00:53:50,780
(Myoung also gets a hint.)

1501
00:53:50,950 --> 00:53:53,320
(What hint did the two of them get?)

1502
00:53:53,320 --> 00:53:56,389
(The forger made his debut before 2010.)

1503
00:53:56,689 --> 00:53:57,950
(Ha Nee in 2006, Sun Kyu in 2005,)

1504
00:53:57,950 --> 00:53:59,760
(and Seung Ryong in 2004)

1505
00:53:59,990 --> 00:54:02,789
(Who is the real forger out of these three?)

1506
00:54:03,860 --> 00:54:05,700
A quest has been discovered.

1507
00:54:06,200 --> 00:54:08,499
Here's a chance to arrest the thieves and the forger.

1508
00:54:08,700 --> 00:54:10,030
This is your last mission.

1509
00:54:10,169 --> 00:54:12,200
It's Ultimate Level Up War.

1510
00:54:12,200 --> 00:54:13,570
(Ultimate Level Up War)

1511
00:54:13,570 --> 00:54:16,010
Among current Running Man members,

1512
00:54:16,269 --> 00:54:20,479
three level badges have been forged.

1513
00:54:20,479 --> 00:54:21,979
- 3? - 3 of them?

1514
00:54:21,979 --> 00:54:23,110
It's three badges.

1515
00:54:23,110 --> 00:54:25,510
(Which ones are forged?)

1516
00:54:25,510 --> 00:54:28,180
Find hints that are hidden in this place.

1517
00:54:28,820 --> 00:54:31,249
If you eliminate thieves and the forger,

1518
00:54:31,519 --> 00:54:34,419
- the citizens and police win. - Okay.

1519
00:54:34,919 --> 00:54:36,590
Running Man citizens gain...

1520
00:54:36,590 --> 00:54:39,530
the level of a thief that you eliminated.

1521
00:54:39,800 --> 00:54:41,999
Police and guest citizens win...

1522
00:54:41,999 --> 00:54:43,970
a gold badge.

1523
00:54:43,970 --> 00:54:45,099
(Police and guest citizens win a gold badge.)

1524
00:54:45,099 --> 00:54:47,340
(They're determined.)

1525
00:54:47,340 --> 00:54:49,809
Once thieves are arrested,

1526
00:54:49,809 --> 00:54:52,209
their level goes to zero.

1527
00:54:52,209 --> 00:54:54,209
(Thieves' level goes to zero when they're eliminated.)

1528
00:54:54,209 --> 00:54:55,539
(It's over once they're arrested.)

1529
00:54:55,539 --> 00:54:56,880
They're placed last.

1530
00:54:57,010 --> 00:55:01,079
If the police and citizens are eliminated,

1531
00:55:01,519 --> 00:55:03,720
- the thieves will win. - What will happen to them?

1532
00:55:03,720 --> 00:55:07,320
Thieves' level will rise to 10.

1533
00:55:07,320 --> 00:55:08,919
(When thieves win, their level rises to 10.)

1534
00:55:09,229 --> 00:55:10,360
- Will it be over? - Really?

1535
00:55:10,360 --> 00:55:12,430
They will be the winner of this project.

1536
00:55:12,430 --> 00:55:13,660
(They'll be the final winner of Level Up Race.)

1537
00:55:13,660 --> 00:55:16,530
Only Kwang Soo would be willing to take such a risk.

1538
00:55:16,530 --> 00:55:18,470
- Why would I? - Kwang Soo.

1539
00:55:18,470 --> 00:55:19,900
- Why me? - You.

1540
00:55:19,900 --> 00:55:22,070
Only Kwang Soo would be willing...

1541
00:55:22,070 --> 00:55:23,709
to take such a risk.

1542
00:55:24,709 --> 00:55:26,809
That's such a groundless and sudden accusation.

1543
00:55:26,809 --> 00:55:28,079
Okay.

1544
00:55:28,240 --> 00:55:31,349
The police may discuss among themselves.

1545
00:55:31,349 --> 00:55:33,450
They can tell their identity to those...

1546
00:55:33,450 --> 00:55:34,780
whom they think are citizens.

1547
00:55:34,780 --> 00:55:36,119
They can reveal their identity.

1548
00:55:36,119 --> 00:55:38,619
They can't tell in case one of them is a thief.

1549
00:55:38,619 --> 00:55:39,619
- Right. - That's correct.

1550
00:55:39,619 --> 00:55:42,430
Please go to your places.

1551
00:55:42,789 --> 00:55:44,729
You'll start individually.

1552
00:55:46,160 --> 00:55:48,459
(Who's helping Jae Seok, the thief?)

1553
00:55:48,459 --> 00:55:50,829
The forger may be Seung Ryong,

1554
00:55:50,829 --> 00:55:54,639
Sun Kyu, or Ha Nee. There are three candidates.

1555
00:55:55,139 --> 00:55:57,669
I suspect Ha Nee.

1556
00:55:58,470 --> 00:56:03,380
I'm starting to see unusual sides of Ha Nee.

1557
00:56:03,910 --> 00:56:07,079
I have to remove Seung Ryong.

1558
00:56:07,220 --> 00:56:10,650
I think Sun Kyu is the forger. I think it's Jin Sun Kyu.

1559
00:56:11,050 --> 00:56:12,660
He keeps on avoiding making eye contacts with me.

1560
00:56:13,059 --> 00:56:14,820
He's not his usual self.

1561
00:56:14,820 --> 00:56:17,490
He's too nice to maintain a poker face.

1562
00:56:18,260 --> 00:56:21,760
Dong Hwi kept on doubting me.

1563
00:56:22,570 --> 00:56:25,070
Dong Hwi? He kept on pointing the finger at me.

1564
00:56:25,200 --> 00:56:26,240
He did.

1565
00:56:26,240 --> 00:56:27,340
(They are suspicious of one another.)

1566
00:56:28,340 --> 00:56:29,439
(Who's the forger out of these three?)

1567
00:56:29,439 --> 00:56:31,340
The race is about to start.

1568
00:56:31,769 --> 00:56:33,439
(There are 2 level thieves from Running Man,)

1569
00:56:33,439 --> 00:56:35,110
(and 3 level badges have been forged.)

1570
00:56:35,110 --> 00:56:38,280
(The police and forger are among the 5 guests.)

1571
00:56:38,280 --> 00:56:39,749
The race has started.

1572
00:56:39,749 --> 00:56:41,550
(The final race has started.)

1573
00:56:42,119 --> 00:56:43,119
(As soon as the race starts...)

1574
00:56:43,119 --> 00:56:44,320
Why is there nobody here?

1575
00:56:44,320 --> 00:56:45,760
(Thief Jae Seok is...)

1576
00:56:45,760 --> 00:56:47,189
(waiting for somebody.)

1577
00:56:47,189 --> 00:56:48,689
Nobody is here yet.

1578
00:56:48,689 --> 00:56:50,130
(He's waiting for somebody.)

1579
00:56:51,430 --> 00:56:53,260
(At that moment!)

1580
00:56:54,130 --> 00:56:57,829
(Jae Seok is glad to see somebody.)

1581
00:56:57,829 --> 00:57:00,800
(It's the other thief and the forger!)

1582
00:57:00,800 --> 00:57:03,639
How do we eliminate the others?

1583
00:57:04,110 --> 00:57:05,309
Do we rip their name tags off?

1584
00:57:05,639 --> 00:57:08,639
This is the hidden elimination rule for your team.

1585
00:57:08,639 --> 00:57:09,680
What is it?

1586
00:57:10,050 --> 00:57:12,180
Each person received a notebook and a pen...

1587
00:57:12,180 --> 00:57:14,579
to make notes.

1588
00:57:14,579 --> 00:57:15,579
(Everybody received a pen.)

1589
00:57:15,579 --> 00:57:17,150
Yes, I have it.

1590
00:57:18,320 --> 00:57:22,990
You must borrow the pen of the person you want to eliminate...

1591
00:57:23,189 --> 00:57:25,329
to eliminate their name tag.

1592
00:57:25,900 --> 00:57:29,030
(Jae Seok laughs after hearing about the hidden rule.)

1593
00:57:30,900 --> 00:57:32,999
- Hello. - Yes, hi.

1594
00:57:32,999 --> 00:57:36,709
You two are the level thieves for today.

1595
00:57:36,740 --> 00:57:39,979
Your job is to steal others' levels and reach Level 10.

1596
00:57:40,110 --> 00:57:41,939
I'm going to steal So Min's for sure.

1597
00:57:42,809 --> 00:57:44,910
I'll take Haha's level for sure.

1598
00:57:46,450 --> 00:57:47,880
Yes, I think so.

1599
00:57:48,150 --> 00:57:50,590
I think it's about time...

1600
00:57:50,590 --> 00:57:53,119
Jong Kook learns what it feels like to lose.

1601
00:57:53,119 --> 00:57:57,789
Then you have chosen So Min, Jong Kook, and Haha.

1602
00:57:58,130 --> 00:58:00,499
We have to run and rip their name tags off.

1603
00:58:00,499 --> 00:58:02,200
We can't hesitate.

1604
00:58:03,030 --> 00:58:04,570
Where are the hints?

1605
00:58:04,570 --> 00:58:06,200
(The thieves and the forger must find hints about the police.)

1606
00:58:06,200 --> 00:58:08,470
It won't be here, right?

1607
00:58:08,470 --> 00:58:10,369
(The police and civilians must find hints about thieves and forger.)

1608
00:58:10,369 --> 00:58:12,039
I need to find some hints.

1609
00:58:12,039 --> 00:58:14,280
(That's the only way to uncover each other's identities.)

1610
00:58:14,780 --> 00:58:17,809
(He searches fervently.)

1611
00:58:19,979 --> 00:58:21,550
Where are the hints?

1612
00:58:21,550 --> 00:58:22,550
(Dong Hwi is looking for the hints.)

1613
00:58:22,550 --> 00:58:24,150
- Who is that? - You scared me.

1614
00:58:24,150 --> 00:58:26,820
Where are you going, Dong Hwi? Why?

1615
00:58:26,820 --> 00:58:28,559
I'm not a thief.

1616
00:58:28,559 --> 00:58:29,559
I just...

1617
00:58:29,559 --> 00:58:30,959
(He's on full alert.)

1618
00:58:31,329 --> 00:58:32,559
Dong Hwi, I'm not...

1619
00:58:34,559 --> 00:58:36,930
(She finds a hint!)

1620
00:58:37,630 --> 00:58:39,570
(She takes it and goes away.)

1621
00:58:39,570 --> 00:58:41,700
Why is she doing that?

1622
00:58:42,099 --> 00:58:43,510
It's nothing.

1623
00:58:46,180 --> 00:58:48,979
She just took...

1624
00:58:49,349 --> 00:58:51,749
(He searches the scene of the incident.)

1625
00:58:52,380 --> 00:58:54,650
- So Min just... - Do you have anything?

1626
00:58:54,650 --> 00:58:57,490
- She... - You're not supposed to write that.

1627
00:58:57,490 --> 00:59:00,160
You're supposed to write about what you found. You don't write...

1628
00:59:00,160 --> 00:59:02,459
- "So Min opened the door." - She took it from here.

1629
00:59:02,490 --> 00:59:05,059
- So Min, can you share it? - No, not with you.

1630
00:59:05,559 --> 00:59:07,760
- I'm a civilian. - You're a suspect.

1631
00:59:07,760 --> 00:59:10,499
You're a suspect to me. No, not you.

1632
00:59:10,499 --> 00:59:12,570
- So Min... - You're kind of...

1633
00:59:13,439 --> 00:59:17,209
How did she know that there was a hint here?

1634
00:59:17,209 --> 00:59:18,539
(How did So Min know?)

1635
00:59:18,939 --> 00:59:20,280
(How did So Min know the location of the hint?)

1636
00:59:20,280 --> 00:59:22,610
She saw me from far away...

1637
00:59:23,010 --> 00:59:25,709
and said, "I'm not a thief."

1638
00:59:26,419 --> 00:59:28,050
Who are you talking to?

1639
00:59:29,180 --> 00:59:30,220
Dong Hwi.

1640
00:59:31,090 --> 00:59:32,119
- Well... - What are you doing?

1641
00:59:32,389 --> 00:59:34,289
Hold on.

1642
00:59:34,289 --> 00:59:35,490
(Dong Hwi's Mystery Files concludes abruptly.)

1643
00:59:35,820 --> 00:59:38,530
Why is he running away?

1644
00:59:39,559 --> 00:59:40,930
Why are you doing that?

1645
00:59:41,059 --> 00:59:43,300
Hey! Why are you... Did you find the hint?

1646
00:59:43,300 --> 00:59:44,470
(Why is Dong Hwi talking to himself and running away?)

1647
00:59:44,470 --> 00:59:45,729
What are you? Are you a thief?

1648
00:59:46,639 --> 00:59:48,639
What are you?

1649
00:59:48,639 --> 00:59:49,639
(He gets caught.)

1650
00:59:49,639 --> 00:59:51,139
- Did you find anything? - No.

1651
00:59:51,139 --> 00:59:52,639
I was a thief last week.

1652
00:59:52,639 --> 00:59:56,050
I finally found out.

1653
00:59:56,050 --> 00:59:57,650
Found out what?

1654
00:59:57,650 --> 01:00:01,079
I found two people...

1655
01:00:01,380 --> 01:00:04,590
who said they were thieves last week. Finally.

1656
01:00:04,650 --> 01:00:06,820
I was thinking about that the whole time.

1657
01:00:07,559 --> 01:00:10,329
Seok Jin and you...

1658
01:00:10,329 --> 01:00:11,889
- Did Seok Jin say that too? - Yes.

1659
01:00:12,430 --> 01:00:14,030
It was Seok Jin and me.

1660
01:00:14,030 --> 01:00:16,070
(Because it was Seok Jin and me.)

1661
01:00:16,070 --> 01:00:17,599
You were telling the truth.

1662
01:00:17,630 --> 01:00:18,769
Yes.

1663
01:00:18,930 --> 01:00:20,470
You should have watched the previous episode.

1664
01:00:20,470 --> 01:00:23,369
I take back what I said earlier.

1665
01:00:23,369 --> 01:00:26,510
- This isn't right. - Who are you talking to?

1666
01:00:27,439 --> 01:00:30,579
You're with me. Why are you talking to the camera?

1667
01:00:30,849 --> 01:00:32,479
This is not "Unanswered Questions".

1668
01:00:33,550 --> 01:00:35,349
I'm sorry. I wasted your time.

1669
01:00:36,249 --> 01:00:37,919
- Anyhow, see you later. - See you.

1670
01:00:37,919 --> 01:00:38,919
(They want to know who the thieves and the forger are.)

1671
01:00:39,459 --> 01:00:40,860
(Seung Ryong is a leading forger suspect.)

1672
01:00:40,860 --> 01:00:42,189
Hold on.

1673
01:00:43,430 --> 01:00:46,599
(If he's the forger, he needs hints about the police.)

1674
01:00:48,130 --> 01:00:49,669
(He finds one in the corner.)

1675
01:00:49,669 --> 01:00:50,729
This is it, right?

1676
01:00:51,669 --> 01:00:54,740
(Who is the hint about?)

1677
01:00:55,769 --> 01:00:59,039
(Thief B is unmarried.)

1678
01:00:59,880 --> 01:01:02,950
(That excludes Seok Jin.)

1679
01:01:04,050 --> 01:01:07,280
(He found a hint about the thief,)

1680
01:01:07,820 --> 01:01:10,550
(but he tries to destroy it.)

1681
01:01:11,749 --> 01:01:13,459
(Is he the forger...)

1682
01:01:13,459 --> 01:01:15,389
(who tries to destroy the hints about the thieves?)

1683
01:01:15,389 --> 01:01:17,189
Shall we go down?

1684
01:01:17,959 --> 01:01:20,860
Should I go this way? Since I'm here.

1685
01:01:21,459 --> 01:01:24,729
(Sun Kyu goes around with a failed poker face.)

1686
01:01:26,639 --> 01:01:28,539
I found it. This is it, right?

1687
01:01:30,669 --> 01:01:32,169
(What hint did he find?)

1688
01:01:32,169 --> 01:01:34,680
"Thief B is a male."

1689
01:01:35,240 --> 01:01:36,550
(If it's a male,)

1690
01:01:36,550 --> 01:01:39,950
(it's either one of these two.)

1691
01:01:41,479 --> 01:01:45,320
I hope I bump into somebody from my team.

1692
01:01:46,789 --> 01:01:49,360
Why are you here?

1693
01:01:49,360 --> 01:01:53,200
You're a suspect as well, so you should be careful.

1694
01:01:53,229 --> 01:01:55,860
You and Jae Seok are Level Two, right?

1695
01:01:55,959 --> 01:01:58,930
People with the lowest levels are...

1696
01:01:58,930 --> 01:02:01,669
probably the thieves. There's a high possibility.

1697
01:02:01,669 --> 01:02:03,970
- Are you doubting me? - Yes.

1698
01:02:04,269 --> 01:02:05,740
I'm doubting you too.

1699
01:02:05,740 --> 01:02:07,139
- Me? - Who is that?

1700
01:02:07,139 --> 01:02:08,510
(At that moment!)

1701
01:02:08,510 --> 01:02:09,709
You're both here.

1702
01:02:09,950 --> 01:02:11,650
- Are you Level Two? - My suspects...

1703
01:02:11,650 --> 01:02:14,780
- Yes. - Let's talk first.

1704
01:02:14,849 --> 01:02:17,689
He's Level Four, so he's so arrogant.

1705
01:02:17,849 --> 01:02:19,590
- What do you mean? - Come here, Jae Seok.

1706
01:02:19,590 --> 01:02:21,260
I know...

1707
01:02:22,220 --> 01:02:25,260
you want to turn the game around,

1708
01:02:25,260 --> 01:02:27,229
but this isn't the right way.

1709
01:02:27,430 --> 01:02:29,669
You should climb the ladder one level at a time.

1710
01:02:29,669 --> 01:02:31,930
Why would you steal?

1711
01:02:32,300 --> 01:02:33,639
Who are you talking about?

1712
01:02:33,639 --> 01:02:35,470
Are you a prosecutor or a judge? Why would you decide?

1713
01:02:35,470 --> 01:02:38,039
I'm already sad I have a low level, and you point the finger at us?

1714
01:02:38,039 --> 01:02:39,979
- Understood? - This is driving me nuts.

1715
01:02:40,180 --> 01:02:42,749
- You two... - I'm so upset.

1716
01:02:42,749 --> 01:02:44,950
- Did you find anything? - No.

1717
01:02:45,180 --> 01:02:46,220
Leave.

1718
01:02:46,220 --> 01:02:47,579
(Leave if you don't have any hints.)

1719
01:02:47,820 --> 01:02:49,820
- I'll leave too. - I'm mad.

1720
01:02:51,320 --> 01:02:54,760
(It's not easy borrowing his pen.)

1721
01:02:55,860 --> 01:02:57,959
(Will he be able to borrow Jong Kook's pen...)

1722
01:02:57,959 --> 01:02:59,829
(and eliminate his name tag?)

1723
01:02:59,829 --> 01:03:02,059
Jong Kook probably threw it away.

1724
01:03:03,630 --> 01:03:05,829
(He doesn't know what's going on.)

1725
01:03:05,829 --> 01:03:08,340
Jong Kook, is there anything you'd like to share?

1726
01:03:08,639 --> 01:03:10,970
This is my intuition. Se Chan...

1727
01:03:11,369 --> 01:03:14,539
behaved a little bit different.

1728
01:03:14,539 --> 01:03:17,280
That's my intuition. Anyhow,

1729
01:03:17,280 --> 01:03:19,249
Jae Seok is a bit strange.

1730
01:03:19,249 --> 01:03:20,320
(According to Jong Kook's logic, Kwang Soo can't be a thief.)

1731
01:03:20,320 --> 01:03:22,220
Oh, gosh. You scared me.

1732
01:03:22,220 --> 01:03:23,550
(It's Jae Seok again.)

1733
01:03:23,990 --> 01:03:25,090
Good luck.

1734
01:03:25,189 --> 01:03:28,519
Hold on. I'm going to the bathroom, but I'm upset about this.

1735
01:03:28,559 --> 01:03:32,360
Are you doubting me...

1736
01:03:32,360 --> 01:03:33,360
because I'm Level Two?

1737
01:03:33,360 --> 01:03:35,300
Do you have anything to prove us wrong?

1738
01:03:35,300 --> 01:03:37,630
If there's anything convincing, we'll trust you.

1739
01:03:38,530 --> 01:03:40,900
- Right? - I'm speechless.

1740
01:03:40,900 --> 01:03:42,039
Why are you pulling your sleeves up?

1741
01:03:42,039 --> 01:03:43,169
I'm going to the bathroom.

1742
01:03:43,639 --> 01:03:45,240
- For washing your hands? - Yes.

1743
01:03:45,240 --> 01:03:47,110
I mistook you when you pulled your sleeves up.

1744
01:03:47,110 --> 01:03:49,209
- It's the police! - You scared me.

1745
01:03:49,209 --> 01:03:50,209
(His heart almost drops.)

1746
01:03:50,209 --> 01:03:51,410
- Why did you get scared? - Why?

1747
01:03:51,410 --> 01:03:53,450
- Why did you get scared? - Why were you startled?

1748
01:03:53,450 --> 01:03:56,189
Is this when "a guilty conscience needs no accuser"?

1749
01:03:56,189 --> 01:03:58,050
All right. I got it.

1750
01:03:58,050 --> 01:04:00,459
- Excuse me. - Sure.

1751
01:04:01,260 --> 01:04:02,590
May I borrow your pen?

1752
01:04:02,590 --> 01:04:03,959
(May I borrow your pen?)

1753
01:04:04,430 --> 01:04:05,590
- My pen? - Yes.

1754
01:04:05,590 --> 01:04:09,400
I have to write down something. I let somebody borrow mine.

1755
01:04:09,400 --> 01:04:12,400
(Will he be able to borrow Jong Kooks' pen?)

1756
01:04:12,400 --> 01:04:13,740
Ask him.

1757
01:04:13,740 --> 01:04:15,300
(Borrow Kwang Soo's.)

1758
01:04:15,740 --> 01:04:18,709
Can I borrow yours? I'm dumbfounded.

1759
01:04:19,169 --> 01:04:20,439
(Jong Kook catches on fast. He's not easily manipulated.)

1760
01:04:20,439 --> 01:04:21,579
You really lent him your pen?

1761
01:04:21,579 --> 01:04:23,910
There's something I need to write.

1762
01:04:23,910 --> 01:04:26,150
You shouldn't lend your pen to just anyone.

1763
01:04:26,380 --> 01:04:29,119
He's going to catch you as soon as you run away.

1764
01:04:29,119 --> 01:04:30,919
- My gosh. - What are you writing down?

1765
01:04:31,119 --> 01:04:33,119
Hold on. I'm going to...

1766
01:04:33,119 --> 01:04:35,860
- Do you have something? - put together the hints I have.

1767
01:04:35,860 --> 01:04:38,430
I was going to the bathroom to do that when you stopped me.

1768
01:04:38,430 --> 01:04:39,959
Anyhow, thank you.

1769
01:04:39,959 --> 01:04:40,959
Hey...

1770
01:04:41,559 --> 01:04:44,070
Jae Seok is so strange today.

1771
01:04:44,269 --> 01:04:45,900
I think there's something going on.

1772
01:04:46,900 --> 01:04:47,939
(It's difficult borrowing other people's pens.)

1773
01:04:47,939 --> 01:04:49,269
This is difficult.

1774
01:04:50,369 --> 01:04:53,410
(How will he borrow three?)

1775
01:04:54,110 --> 01:04:55,209
Jae Seok.

1776
01:04:55,539 --> 01:04:57,450
- Yes? - I'm a civilian.

1777
01:04:57,650 --> 01:04:59,050
Catch the thief with me.

1778
01:04:59,050 --> 01:05:00,320
(That came out of nowhere.)

1779
01:05:00,550 --> 01:05:03,389
(Does she think I'm a civilian?)

1780
01:05:03,450 --> 01:05:04,689
Are you really a civilian?

1781
01:05:04,689 --> 01:05:06,820
Let me tell you my hint. Thief A is...

1782
01:05:06,820 --> 01:05:08,119
taller than 170cm.

1783
01:05:08,119 --> 01:05:10,959
Hold on. I'm going to write this down.

1784
01:05:10,959 --> 01:05:12,360
(So Min thinks Jae Seok is a civilian.)

1785
01:05:12,360 --> 01:05:13,860
Can you tell me one? Do you have anything?

1786
01:05:13,860 --> 01:05:16,160
- I don't have any. - You got one.

1787
01:05:16,160 --> 01:05:17,970
I don't have a pen.

1788
01:05:17,970 --> 01:05:20,039
You got one. Can you tell me?

1789
01:05:20,039 --> 01:05:21,369
(Will So Min...)

1790
01:05:21,369 --> 01:05:24,570
(give him the pen without question?)

1791
01:05:25,970 --> 01:05:28,939
Here.

1792
01:05:29,910 --> 01:05:32,809
(He borrowed So Min's pen!)

1793
01:05:32,950 --> 01:05:35,019
- Give me one hint. - I don't have any.

1794
01:05:35,019 --> 01:05:36,389
You got one earlier.

1795
01:05:36,389 --> 01:05:38,689
- It's too general. - I still want to know.

1796
01:05:39,119 --> 01:05:41,689
There are 5 guests. It's 1 of them.

1797
01:05:41,689 --> 01:05:44,059
- The thief? - No, what is that?

1798
01:05:44,059 --> 01:05:45,360
- The forger? - Yes.

1799
01:05:45,360 --> 01:05:47,860
You're lying to me, aren't you?

1800
01:05:48,329 --> 01:05:50,070
That's the hint I got.

1801
01:05:50,070 --> 01:05:53,400
(She gets anxious and looks around.)

1802
01:05:53,400 --> 01:05:54,700
No...

1803
01:05:57,039 --> 01:05:59,039
You're not a civilian.

1804
01:05:59,209 --> 01:06:01,510
- I am. - You're not.

1805
01:06:01,510 --> 01:06:03,150
(Jae Seok acts suspiciously.)

1806
01:06:03,150 --> 01:06:04,579
- My gosh. - Why aren't you telling me?

1807
01:06:05,150 --> 01:06:07,579
I'm going to look for more hints. I don't have enough.

1808
01:06:08,749 --> 01:06:10,919
I have to find another hint.

1809
01:06:12,959 --> 01:06:14,519
(At that moment!)

1810
01:06:14,519 --> 01:06:16,530
I'm getting thirsty.

1811
01:06:17,189 --> 01:06:18,789
This is thrilling.

1812
01:06:18,789 --> 01:06:19,959
(The forger suspects are on the move.)

1813
01:06:20,260 --> 01:06:22,930
I want to go up. I'll go later.

1814
01:06:23,099 --> 01:06:24,200
So Min.

1815
01:06:24,200 --> 01:06:25,499
(So Min doesn't know anything. Somebody is following her.)

1816
01:06:25,499 --> 01:06:27,340
(Who's calling me?)

1817
01:06:27,340 --> 01:06:28,539
Why is somebody following me?

1818
01:06:28,539 --> 01:06:30,470
(The person following her is...)

1819
01:06:30,470 --> 01:06:32,869
(Seung Ryong, who is a forger suspect.)

1820
01:06:32,869 --> 01:06:35,139
(He starts running all of a sudden!)

1821
01:06:36,610 --> 01:06:38,150
(He runs after her,)

1822
01:06:38,150 --> 01:06:39,479
(and she runs away.)

1823
01:06:39,479 --> 01:06:41,050
(It's a chase.)

1824
01:06:41,050 --> 01:06:42,050
So Min.

1825
01:06:42,349 --> 01:06:43,389
- Yes? - So Min.

1826
01:06:43,889 --> 01:06:44,990
Come here.

1827
01:06:44,990 --> 01:06:46,660
(She can't get away.)

1828
01:06:48,389 --> 01:06:49,559
Is there an exit here?

1829
01:06:49,689 --> 01:06:50,959
No, there isn't.

1830
01:06:50,959 --> 01:06:52,160
(It's a dead-end.)

1831
01:06:52,160 --> 01:06:53,260
What are you doing then?

1832
01:06:54,760 --> 01:06:56,059
- Are you running away? - Yes.

1833
01:06:56,059 --> 01:06:58,200
(Are you running away?)

1834
01:06:58,630 --> 01:07:02,169
(There's nowhere for her to hide.)

1835
01:07:02,240 --> 01:07:03,639
There's always a twist.

1836
01:07:03,639 --> 01:07:05,610
You have to help me.

1837
01:07:07,240 --> 01:07:08,340
(Ripping)

1838
01:07:09,410 --> 01:07:10,849
What was that?

1839
01:07:10,849 --> 01:07:14,050
Civilian Jeon So Min is out.

1840
01:07:14,050 --> 01:07:17,849
(According to Jae Seok's plan, So Min is out.)

1841
01:07:17,849 --> 01:07:21,019
You have chosen So Min, Jong Kook, and Haha.

1842
01:07:21,019 --> 01:07:22,860
(There are only Jong Kook and Haha left.)

1843
01:07:24,229 --> 01:07:25,360
For Jong Kook,

1844
01:07:25,360 --> 01:07:27,360
(Will he continue the momentum and eliminate Jong Kook as well?)

1845
01:07:27,360 --> 01:07:28,700
there's going to be a moment of chance.

1846
01:07:29,300 --> 01:07:30,999
"Can I borrow your pen?"

1847
01:07:31,369 --> 01:07:32,930
Then I have to rip his name tag off right away.

1848
01:07:32,930 --> 01:07:33,939
(Eliminating Jong Kook is their biggest dilemma.)

1849
01:07:33,939 --> 01:07:36,669
(Will he be successful?)

1850
01:07:37,510 --> 01:07:38,970
What are the hints?

1851
01:07:38,970 --> 01:07:41,579
- Do you want to hear me out? - Okay, let me hear you.

1852
01:07:41,579 --> 01:07:42,579
All right.

1853
01:07:42,740 --> 01:07:44,150
Let me show you.

1854
01:07:44,150 --> 01:07:45,780
You can calculate it.

1855
01:07:46,050 --> 01:07:48,749
For Levels 4 and 2, this person needs 6,

1856
01:07:48,749 --> 01:07:50,519
and this person needs eight.

1857
01:07:50,820 --> 01:07:53,019
So Min is Level Six, so they can steal hers,

1858
01:07:53,019 --> 01:07:54,689
and they can steal 2 Level 2s.

1859
01:07:54,860 --> 01:07:57,389
That or 1 Level 4...

1860
01:07:57,689 --> 01:07:59,130
and 2 Level 2s.

1861
01:07:59,160 --> 01:08:00,400
That's difficult.

1862
01:08:00,400 --> 01:08:02,030
Do you have a hint? Let's talk.

1863
01:08:02,030 --> 01:08:03,200
Do you have a hint?

1864
01:08:03,229 --> 01:08:05,700
Thief B is...

1865
01:08:05,700 --> 01:08:07,470
(Jae Seok and Kwang Soo are also speculating.)

1866
01:08:07,499 --> 01:08:08,840
unmarried.

1867
01:08:09,039 --> 01:08:10,110
Unmarried?

1868
01:08:10,110 --> 01:08:12,240
(Jae Seok, Se Chan, and Kwang Soo are in one spot.)

1869
01:08:12,240 --> 01:08:13,639
- Kwang Soo. - They scared me.

1870
01:08:13,639 --> 01:08:14,840
(Jae Seok, Se Chan, and Kwang Soo are in one spot.)

1871
01:08:14,840 --> 01:08:17,110
You probably have an insignificant hint.

1872
01:08:17,110 --> 01:08:18,709
Look at you trying to play us.

1873
01:08:18,849 --> 01:08:20,820
- Sorry. - Do you not have a pen?

1874
01:08:20,820 --> 01:08:22,119
I lost mine.

1875
01:08:22,119 --> 01:08:24,119
Where did you put yours?

1876
01:08:24,119 --> 01:08:26,090
- I'm begging for pens right now. - What are you?

1877
01:08:26,119 --> 01:08:27,760
They stole...

1878
01:08:27,760 --> 01:08:29,119
- They stole the levels. - the levels of three members...

1879
01:08:29,119 --> 01:08:30,729
- and achieved the highest level. - That's right.

1880
01:08:30,789 --> 01:08:32,030
Both of them?

1881
01:08:32,030 --> 01:08:34,200
Both of them will achieve the highest level...

1882
01:08:34,900 --> 01:08:36,499
if a Level Two...

1883
01:08:36,499 --> 01:08:38,329
- Level 4. - and a Level 4...

1884
01:08:39,169 --> 01:08:41,539
If Level Four take So Min's,

1885
01:08:41,669 --> 01:08:42,900
- they get Level 10. - Level 10.

1886
01:08:42,900 --> 01:08:44,610
- If Level 2... - And if Level 2...

1887
01:08:44,610 --> 01:08:46,539
takes 2 Level 4s, they reach Level 10.

1888
01:08:47,380 --> 01:08:48,639
That's how they win.

1889
01:08:48,680 --> 01:08:50,550
If they take a Level Four...

1890
01:08:50,650 --> 01:08:52,450
- and instead of two... - I have to find the hints.

1891
01:08:52,450 --> 01:08:53,820
- Ha Nee. - I have to find the hints.

1892
01:08:54,549 --> 01:08:57,750
(Ha Nee, another forger suspect, is here.)

1893
01:08:58,290 --> 01:09:00,759
I have to find the hints. They're nowhere to be found.

1894
01:09:00,759 --> 01:09:02,120
- Is it so hard to find? - Yes.

1895
01:09:02,189 --> 01:09:04,129
I can't find anything.

1896
01:09:04,460 --> 01:09:06,559
I looked in the trash.

1897
01:09:06,629 --> 01:09:09,500
Excuse me, but why are you angry?

1898
01:09:09,629 --> 01:09:11,629
(Why are you yelling at us?)

1899
01:09:11,629 --> 01:09:13,670
You'll find it. You'll get one. Don't worry.

1900
01:09:13,670 --> 01:09:14,939
There's nothing.

1901
01:09:14,939 --> 01:09:17,240
I kept on looking. I went through 1st to 3rd floors.

1902
01:09:17,570 --> 01:09:19,170
- You have to keep looking. - Goodness.

1903
01:09:19,240 --> 01:09:20,740
Do you have any hints?

1904
01:09:20,740 --> 01:09:22,040
I don't.

1905
01:09:22,040 --> 01:09:24,049
If you have any, please share.

1906
01:09:24,179 --> 01:09:26,580
It's not in the trash. Don't look in there.

1907
01:09:27,549 --> 01:09:28,620
(Se Chan leaves the conversation.)

1908
01:09:28,620 --> 01:09:30,049
There's a possibility.

1909
01:09:30,049 --> 01:09:31,490
The trash... What is it?

1910
01:09:32,250 --> 01:09:34,320
- It sounds credible, right? - Yes.

1911
01:09:34,320 --> 01:09:36,559
It does. It's very possible.

1912
01:09:36,689 --> 01:09:37,729
I'm certain.

1913
01:09:37,929 --> 01:09:40,259
- This makes sense. - What is it?

1914
01:09:40,299 --> 01:09:42,400
- What is it? - This works.

1915
01:09:43,370 --> 01:09:46,429
(Jae Seok was looking for a chance.)

1916
01:09:46,429 --> 01:09:47,570
Are there 3 Level 4s?

1917
01:09:47,599 --> 01:09:48,670
Can I borrow a pen?

1918
01:09:48,670 --> 01:09:51,210
(He tries to borrow Jong Kook's pen again.)

1919
01:09:51,439 --> 01:09:54,080
For Jong Kook, there's going to be a moment of chance.

1920
01:09:54,080 --> 01:09:56,309
(Can he borrow it this time?)

1921
01:09:56,309 --> 01:09:57,650
I'm sorry.

1922
01:09:58,349 --> 01:09:59,710
I'm sorry.

1923
01:09:59,710 --> 01:10:00,820
Why do you keep borrowing pens?

1924
01:10:00,820 --> 01:10:02,120
It's something we talked about.

1925
01:10:02,120 --> 01:10:04,049
Hold on. Let me figure this out.

1926
01:10:04,990 --> 01:10:06,589
Let me figure this one thing out.

1927
01:10:06,589 --> 01:10:07,589
(Please...)

1928
01:10:08,460 --> 01:10:09,960
(He has to take it out.)

1929
01:10:09,960 --> 01:10:11,759
- Let me figure this one thing out. - Is there...

1930
01:10:11,759 --> 01:10:14,559
a mission where you have to borrow everybody's pens?

1931
01:10:14,559 --> 01:10:15,830
(He catches on fast.)

1932
01:10:15,830 --> 01:10:17,500
Gosh, this is annoying.

1933
01:10:18,030 --> 01:10:21,700
(Will he not be able to borrow the pen?)

1934
01:10:21,799 --> 01:10:23,910
- My pen... - You get tricked all the time.

1935
01:10:23,910 --> 01:10:26,780
(Jong Kook hesitated, but he lets Jae Seok borrow it.)

1936
01:10:26,780 --> 01:10:28,780
- Hold on. My pen... - You get tricked all the time.

1937
01:10:28,839 --> 01:10:30,049
Hold on.

1938
01:10:30,049 --> 01:10:31,809
- Hold on. This... - We do that a lot.

1939
01:10:31,809 --> 01:10:33,519
Hold on. Let me figure this out.

1940
01:10:33,679 --> 01:10:35,080
- I trust you unconditionally. - Okay.

1941
01:10:35,920 --> 01:10:40,889
(The moment Jae Seok borrows the pen, he makes the move again.)

1942
01:10:41,620 --> 01:10:43,089
- I trust you unconditionally. - Okay.

1943
01:10:43,089 --> 01:10:44,229
(Will Jong Kook get eliminated like So Min?)

1944
01:10:44,229 --> 01:10:45,729
You have to trust me. You saw me.

1945
01:10:45,729 --> 01:10:47,330
- I know. - When's your birthday, Jong Kook?

1946
01:10:47,330 --> 01:10:50,129
- Would it be somewhere here? - April.

1947
01:10:51,070 --> 01:10:52,599
Can it be here?

1948
01:10:52,799 --> 01:10:55,500
Look. There are 3 Level 4s.

1949
01:10:57,839 --> 01:10:59,210
Haha...

1950
01:10:59,210 --> 01:11:00,379
You know it's not me, right?

1951
01:11:01,040 --> 01:11:03,309
If it's neither you nor me, there's no other Level Four.

1952
01:11:03,309 --> 01:11:04,349
(Like Se Chan said, is Level 4 the other thief?)

1953
01:11:04,349 --> 01:11:05,750
- Shouldn't it be here? - It's Haha.

1954
01:11:06,080 --> 01:11:07,219
What the...

1955
01:11:07,219 --> 01:11:09,379
(All of a sudden!)

1956
01:11:11,389 --> 01:11:14,420
(Ha Nee rips off Jong Kook's name tag.)

1957
01:11:15,189 --> 01:11:18,559
(Kwang Soo couldn't do anything.)

1958
01:11:18,889 --> 01:11:21,530
(Ripping)

1959
01:11:22,500 --> 01:11:25,530
(The second target, Jong Kook, is out.)

1960
01:11:25,670 --> 01:11:26,870
Sorry.

1961
01:11:26,870 --> 01:11:29,200
(What happened?)

1962
01:11:31,070 --> 01:11:33,139
Here's the assistant who'll help you ...

1963
01:11:33,309 --> 01:11:35,379
with the forged level badges.

1964
01:11:36,009 --> 01:11:38,450
- Is there an assistant? - Let me introduce the forger.

1965
01:11:38,450 --> 01:11:40,349
(The forger who'll help the thieves is...)

1966
01:11:40,349 --> 01:11:41,519
Hello.

1967
01:11:41,519 --> 01:11:44,150
(Ha Nee!)

1968
01:11:44,150 --> 01:11:45,920
- Hello. - Ha Nee.

1969
01:11:45,920 --> 01:11:47,519
- Oh, dear. - Hi.

1970
01:11:48,089 --> 01:11:51,229
(The truth gets uncovered.)

1971
01:11:52,189 --> 01:11:54,299
(Here was the thieves' strategy.)

1972
01:11:54,299 --> 01:11:56,460
Here. Give me one.

1973
01:11:57,400 --> 01:12:00,900
(Jae Seok borrowed the pen.)

1974
01:12:00,900 --> 01:12:05,139
(Ha Nee approached So Min without telling her she's the forger.)

1975
01:12:05,139 --> 01:12:07,540
(Ripping)

1976
01:12:08,839 --> 01:12:11,780
(That's how So Min got eliminated.)

1977
01:12:11,879 --> 01:12:13,750
(Sorry, So Min. I'm the forger.)

1978
01:12:13,750 --> 01:12:14,849
What are you?

1979
01:12:17,049 --> 01:12:18,150
- In any case... - Jong Kook,

1980
01:12:18,150 --> 01:12:20,059
I'm going to keep this at my house...

1981
01:12:20,059 --> 01:12:21,719
- as a family treasure. - All right.

1982
01:12:22,689 --> 01:12:23,830
I'll take this.

1983
01:12:23,860 --> 01:12:25,460
I love you, Jong Kook.

1984
01:12:25,460 --> 01:12:30,469
(Thanks to Ha Nee's perfect acting, Jong Kook is out.)

1985
01:12:30,469 --> 01:12:32,969
Civilian Kim Jong Kook is out.

1986
01:12:34,240 --> 01:12:40,110
(Seung Ryong was surprised to hear that. What is his identity?)

1987
01:12:42,639 --> 01:12:45,309
(SBS waiting room before filming)

1988
01:12:45,309 --> 01:12:46,610
- Hello. - You're...

1989
01:12:46,650 --> 01:12:50,150
a police officer who is on stakeout to catch the thieves and the forger.

1990
01:12:50,150 --> 01:12:52,549
(Seung Ryong is a police officer.)

1991
01:12:54,059 --> 01:12:55,889
(He was searching around...)

1992
01:12:55,889 --> 01:12:57,660
(and found a hint about the thieves.)

1993
01:12:57,660 --> 01:12:59,229
I have to do this for justice.

1994
01:12:59,229 --> 01:13:00,799
(Thief A is taller than 170cm.)

1995
01:13:00,799 --> 01:13:02,759
(Jae Seok, Seok Jin, Jong Kook, Kwang Soo, Se Chan)

1996
01:13:03,000 --> 01:13:04,099
So Min!

1997
01:13:04,370 --> 01:13:06,000
(So Min and Haha are shorter than 170cm,)

1998
01:13:06,000 --> 01:13:07,670
(so he tries to win them over.)

1999
01:13:07,799 --> 01:13:09,070
You have to help me.

2000
01:13:09,700 --> 01:13:11,769
I'm the police.

2001
01:13:11,769 --> 01:13:13,040
(You're the police?)

2002
01:13:13,040 --> 01:13:14,679
- Help me. - Are you the police?

2003
01:13:14,740 --> 01:13:16,280
- Are you serious? - I know.

2004
01:13:16,280 --> 01:13:18,009
- Are you the police? - Why can't you trust me?

2005
01:13:18,009 --> 01:13:19,580
(Do people lie to you all the time?)

2006
01:13:19,580 --> 01:13:20,580
Okay?

2007
01:13:20,950 --> 01:13:21,950
Seung Ryong.

2008
01:13:21,950 --> 01:13:22,979
Are you the police?

2009
01:13:23,219 --> 01:13:24,320
How did you know?

2010
01:13:24,519 --> 01:13:25,589
Salute.

2011
01:13:25,589 --> 01:13:26,759
First of all...

2012
01:13:26,759 --> 01:13:29,889
(He approached Haha as well and said he was the police.)

2013
01:13:30,089 --> 01:13:31,830
I'm so nervous.

2014
01:13:32,860 --> 01:13:34,629
Gong Myoung, come here.

2015
01:13:36,660 --> 01:13:37,830
What was the hint?

2016
01:13:38,000 --> 01:13:39,830
I'll give you one if you give me yours.

2017
01:13:39,830 --> 01:13:40,870
- Do you want a hint? - Yes.

2018
01:13:40,870 --> 01:13:42,540
- I'm the police. - Really?

2019
01:13:42,540 --> 01:13:43,610
(He won over people whom he was certain were the civilians.)

2020
01:13:43,610 --> 01:13:44,710
I'm the police.

2021
01:13:44,710 --> 01:13:47,580
(He formed a team to catch the thieves.)

2022
01:13:47,580 --> 01:13:49,280
You have to help me, okay?

2023
01:13:49,280 --> 01:13:50,509
Okay.

2024
01:13:51,950 --> 01:13:54,679
Civilian Kim Jong Kook is out.

2025
01:13:54,679 --> 01:13:55,849
(Civilian Kim Jong Kook is out.)

2026
01:13:57,320 --> 01:13:58,389
Then...

2027
01:13:58,389 --> 01:14:00,719
- Hold on. - He's an innocent civilian.

2028
01:14:00,790 --> 01:14:01,960
He is.

2029
01:14:01,960 --> 01:14:03,960
I figured it out now.

2030
01:14:04,689 --> 01:14:06,559
- Jae Seok has to be the thief. - Right.

2031
01:14:06,683 --> 01:14:10,083
<font color="#fcc89b">[VIU Ver] SBS E435 Running Man</font>

<font color="#ff5fa2">-♥ Ruo Xi ♥-</font>

2032
01:14:10,200 --> 01:14:15,400
(Gong Myoung found a hint.)

2033
01:14:17,469 --> 01:14:21,210
(Thief A is in their 40s. Jae Seok, Jong Kook, Haha)

2034
01:14:22,139 --> 01:14:23,139
What?

2035
01:14:23,139 --> 01:14:25,679
(The last hint said he's taller than 170cm.)

2036
01:14:25,679 --> 01:14:29,650
(Haha is not over 170cm, so he's excluded.)

2037
01:14:29,650 --> 01:14:31,950
(Jong Kook just got eliminated,)

2038
01:14:31,950 --> 01:14:33,460
(so Jae Seok has to be the thief.)

2039
01:14:33,460 --> 01:14:35,059
Jae Seok has to be the thief.

2040
01:14:35,059 --> 01:14:36,860
Right, I said it was him too.

2041
01:14:36,860 --> 01:14:38,729
We have to catch and eliminate him.

2042
01:14:38,759 --> 01:14:41,200
- Let's rip his name tag off first. - Okay.

2043
01:14:41,200 --> 01:14:42,259
He's the thief for sure.

2044
01:14:42,330 --> 01:14:43,700
Let's go. Be natural.

2045
01:14:43,769 --> 01:14:45,030
I can't be eliminated,

2046
01:14:45,030 --> 01:14:46,170
- so you two go. - Okay.

2047
01:14:47,769 --> 01:14:50,210
(I'm not saying this because I'm scared.)

2048
01:14:50,210 --> 01:14:52,439
(He prefers to be on a stakeout.)

2049
01:14:52,710 --> 01:14:53,740
This...

2050
01:14:54,379 --> 01:14:55,979
We're halfway there.

2051
01:14:55,979 --> 01:14:57,080
(Jae Seok doesn't know that his identity got uncovered.)

2052
01:14:57,080 --> 01:15:00,110
(Haha and Gong Myoung are looking for him.)

2053
01:15:00,920 --> 01:15:01,979
Jae Seok.

2054
01:15:02,080 --> 01:15:04,389
Who do you think it is? Who is it?

2055
01:15:05,049 --> 01:15:09,420
(They approach Jae Seok by asking him a question.)

2056
01:15:09,420 --> 01:15:11,229
(Jae Seok doesn't know his identity got uncovered.)

2057
01:15:11,229 --> 01:15:13,129
I thought...

2058
01:15:13,129 --> 01:15:15,259
it was Jong Kook and Se Chan.

2059
01:15:15,929 --> 01:15:17,269
But Jong Kook is out.

2060
01:15:17,269 --> 01:15:20,240
(Jae Seok doesn't know they're here for him.)

2061
01:15:20,240 --> 01:15:21,400
So Min is out too.

2062
01:15:21,400 --> 01:15:24,339
She's Level Six, so that was an easy guess.

2063
01:15:25,269 --> 01:15:27,110
- What are you? - What do you mean?

2064
01:15:27,580 --> 01:15:29,080
- Where were you? - What?

2065
01:15:29,809 --> 01:15:30,809
What do you mean?

2066
01:15:30,849 --> 01:15:32,049
Why are you guys...

2067
01:15:32,780 --> 01:15:35,719
(They start moving!)

2068
01:15:35,719 --> 01:15:38,950
(Jae Seok is cornered.)

2069
01:15:39,019 --> 01:15:42,420
(He realizes it and tries to get out.)

2070
01:15:42,420 --> 01:15:49,559
(Level thief Yu Jae Seok is out.)

2071
01:15:50,000 --> 01:15:51,030
We were right.

2072
01:15:51,729 --> 01:15:53,269
(Level 4 Haha eliminated Level 2 Jae Seok. He's Level 6.)

2073
01:15:53,269 --> 01:15:54,570
I'm so mad.

2074
01:15:55,370 --> 01:15:57,170
I'm mad.

2075
01:15:57,240 --> 01:15:59,269
- I'm mad. - You're Level Six.

2076
01:16:00,910 --> 01:16:02,740
(Haha succeeds to catch a thief and level up.)

2077
01:16:02,740 --> 01:16:05,210
Thief Yu Jae Seok is out.

2078
01:16:06,509 --> 01:16:09,620
(Jae Seok got caught.)

2079
01:16:11,389 --> 01:16:14,019
The race ends if the police gets caught, right?

2080
01:16:15,589 --> 01:16:16,860
What is going on?

2081
01:16:16,860 --> 01:16:20,330
(The remaining thief's identity is unknown.)

2082
01:16:23,030 --> 01:16:24,030
Okay.

2083
01:16:24,030 --> 01:16:26,500
(Seung Ryong apprehended a thief by using his agents.)

2084
01:16:26,729 --> 01:16:28,799
(Forger Ha Nee and Thief B...)

2085
01:16:28,799 --> 01:16:31,110
(versus Police Seung Ryong and civilians)

2086
01:16:32,469 --> 01:16:35,110
I made deductions until my notebook became tattered.

2087
01:16:35,110 --> 01:16:36,780
I knew Jae Seok was a thief.

2088
01:16:36,780 --> 01:16:37,849
(Dong Hwi wants to know.)

2089
01:16:37,849 --> 01:16:39,280
I will get to work.

2090
01:16:39,379 --> 01:16:43,250
Now, I only have my cold judgments to trust.

2091
01:16:46,920 --> 01:16:48,620
(What?)

2092
01:16:48,620 --> 01:16:49,620
Dong Hwi.

2093
01:16:50,019 --> 01:16:54,000
(Seok Jin is sitting down because he ran out of energy.)

2094
01:16:54,160 --> 01:16:55,960
Dong Hwi, I am exhausted.

2095
01:16:55,960 --> 01:16:57,729
- Do you... - I think you are a civilian.

2096
01:16:57,729 --> 01:16:58,969
Do you admit your deductions were wrong?

2097
01:16:58,969 --> 01:17:00,500
I am a civilian too.

2098
01:17:00,500 --> 01:17:01,570
- That's right. - You know, right?

2099
01:17:01,570 --> 01:17:02,839
I never thought you were anything else.

2100
01:17:02,839 --> 01:17:04,769
- Right? - Right.

2101
01:17:04,769 --> 01:17:06,139
Who do you think it is?

2102
01:17:06,139 --> 01:17:07,280
(Give me the answer.)

2103
01:17:07,280 --> 01:17:08,509
I figured it out.

2104
01:17:08,509 --> 01:17:09,610
(He used his deductive skills.)

2105
01:17:09,610 --> 01:17:10,750
How did you do that?

2106
01:17:11,379 --> 01:17:13,110
I combined the hints.

2107
01:17:13,110 --> 01:17:14,650
(I combined the hints.)

2108
01:17:14,650 --> 01:17:16,019
- Who is it? - The forger thinks...

2109
01:17:16,019 --> 01:17:17,689
I am being fooled.

2110
01:17:17,689 --> 01:17:18,689
It's Sun Kyu, right?

2111
01:17:18,689 --> 01:17:20,290
(Sun Kyu?)

2112
01:17:20,290 --> 01:17:22,219
- How did you know? - Because it isn't Ha Nee.

2113
01:17:22,990 --> 01:17:24,759
(He went with his hunch.)

2114
01:17:24,759 --> 01:17:26,889
I have been walking around with Sun Kyu.

2115
01:17:26,889 --> 01:17:28,200
He thinks you are on his side.

2116
01:17:28,200 --> 01:17:30,330
He thinks he got me fooled.

2117
01:17:30,330 --> 01:17:31,900
I figured it out.

2118
01:17:31,900 --> 01:17:33,030
(The clueless duo sets out to catch Sun Kyu.)

2119
01:17:33,030 --> 01:17:35,000
The civilians are doing all the work today.

2120
01:17:35,769 --> 01:17:38,939
(Meanwhile, Sun Kyu is tired of being suspected.)

2121
01:17:38,939 --> 01:17:42,610
(I really am a civilian.)

2122
01:17:43,679 --> 01:17:46,080
(The clueless duo spots him.)

2123
01:17:46,809 --> 01:17:48,080
- There is a civilian. - Yes.

2124
01:17:48,080 --> 01:17:49,549
- Dong Hwi. - Did you eliminate Ha Nee?

2125
01:17:50,150 --> 01:17:51,420
- Ha Nee. - No, I didn't.

2126
01:17:51,420 --> 01:17:52,549
We need to rip off Ha Nee's name tag.

2127
01:17:52,549 --> 01:17:55,290
- That's right. She is an assistant. - I am 100 percent sure.

2128
01:17:55,290 --> 01:17:56,689
- She is an assistant. - Let's go.

2129
01:17:57,330 --> 01:17:58,460
- That's right. - What?

2130
01:17:58,460 --> 01:17:59,729
What are you doing?

2131
01:17:59,729 --> 01:18:02,360
(The clueless duo begins to apprehend him.)

2132
01:18:02,360 --> 01:18:04,570
(Sun Kyu's name tag gets ripped off right away.)

2133
01:18:05,229 --> 01:18:06,370
Fools.

2134
01:18:06,370 --> 01:18:08,139
- Is he a civilian? - Jin Sun Kyu is out.

2135
01:18:08,599 --> 01:18:10,000
- Is he a civilian? - Fools.

2136
01:18:10,000 --> 01:18:11,670
(Jin Sun Kyu and Lee Dong Hwi are out.)

2137
01:18:11,670 --> 01:18:13,269
You said it's him.

2138
01:18:13,269 --> 01:18:14,809
You fool.

2139
01:18:15,839 --> 01:18:18,379
Civilian Jin Sun Kyu is out.

2140
01:18:18,379 --> 01:18:19,610
Thief Jin Sun Kyu?

2141
01:18:19,849 --> 01:18:21,450
Civilian Jin Sun Kyu.

2142
01:18:21,450 --> 01:18:25,650
(He collapses.)

2143
01:18:27,620 --> 01:18:29,889
Civilian Lee Dong Hwi is out.

2144
01:18:29,889 --> 01:18:32,089
Civilian Lee Dong Hwi is out.

2145
01:18:32,530 --> 01:18:34,759
Ha Nee, Ha Nee!

2146
01:18:34,759 --> 01:18:37,530
(So Ha Nee is the forger.)

2147
01:18:39,030 --> 01:18:42,540
(This is a disaster!)

2148
01:18:43,099 --> 01:18:46,240
I know for sure that five people are civilians.

2149
01:18:46,240 --> 01:18:47,339
(Seung Ryong made a list of civilians before the race.)

2150
01:18:47,339 --> 01:18:50,309
I think Ha Nee is a civilian...

2151
01:18:50,309 --> 01:18:51,549
for sure.

2152
01:18:53,009 --> 01:18:54,379
I am the police.

2153
01:18:54,849 --> 01:18:56,820
You are the police? Don't lie.

2154
01:18:56,820 --> 01:19:00,089
Why would I lie about it?

2155
01:19:01,320 --> 01:19:02,660
Help me, okay?

2156
01:19:02,660 --> 01:19:03,860
- Okay. - Okay.

2157
01:19:03,860 --> 01:19:05,729
- Don't tell anyone. - Are you really the police?

2158
01:19:05,729 --> 01:19:07,229
Of course I am.

2159
01:19:07,229 --> 01:19:08,799
(He trusted her.)

2160
01:19:09,629 --> 01:19:10,929
(His brain stopped working.)

2161
01:19:10,929 --> 01:19:12,129
This is a disaster.

2162
01:19:12,530 --> 01:19:16,070
(I revealed my identity to everyone.)

2163
01:19:16,269 --> 01:19:19,570
(How will I win when they know my identity?)

2164
01:19:19,670 --> 01:19:22,240
I need to rip off Haha's name tag.

2165
01:19:22,240 --> 01:19:24,009
(Ha Nee is looking for Haha, the last target.)

2166
01:19:24,610 --> 01:19:28,080
If I hold out until the end, I will survive.

2167
01:19:30,719 --> 01:19:34,290
(Se Chan is behind Haha.)

2168
01:19:37,259 --> 01:19:39,929
Se Chan is behind me.

2169
01:19:41,099 --> 01:19:42,229
Haha.

2170
01:19:42,229 --> 01:19:44,170
(Why is Se Chan following Haha?)

2171
01:19:44,170 --> 01:19:45,969
It's Se Chan.

2172
01:19:45,969 --> 01:19:47,000
(He is suspicious.)

2173
01:19:47,000 --> 01:19:48,170
(Haha suspects Se Chan.)

2174
01:19:48,170 --> 01:19:50,170
When you are cornered,

2175
01:19:50,299 --> 01:19:52,009
you begin to act in a strange way. That's what I am doing.

2176
01:19:52,210 --> 01:19:54,080
I don't know. Let him rip off my name tag.

2177
01:19:54,080 --> 01:19:56,979
(Se Chan's behavior turns Haha's suspicion into conviction.)

2178
01:19:56,979 --> 01:19:58,210
Se Chan.

2179
01:19:58,349 --> 01:19:59,750
- Okay. - Don't be mistaken.

2180
01:19:59,750 --> 01:20:00,920
- Haha. - See you later.

2181
01:20:00,920 --> 01:20:03,019
I won't rip off your name tag. I know you aren't a thief.

2182
01:20:03,019 --> 01:20:07,620
(Is Se Chan a thief?)

2183
01:20:11,559 --> 01:20:12,759
- What should we do? - It can't be helped.

2184
01:20:12,759 --> 01:20:14,229
I swear I am not a thief.

2185
01:20:14,299 --> 01:20:15,559
You look like you are telling the truth.

2186
01:20:15,559 --> 01:20:16,660
I am.

2187
01:20:17,330 --> 01:20:18,769
(Kwang Soo is under suspicion.)

2188
01:20:18,769 --> 01:20:21,240
Okay. Let me talk to Gong Myoung a bit more.

2189
01:20:22,339 --> 01:20:24,509
- I will look for hints. - Okay.

2190
01:20:25,809 --> 01:20:28,339
(Kwang Soo leaves to look for hints.)

2191
01:20:30,580 --> 01:20:33,080
Either Se Chan or Kwang Soo is a thief.

2192
01:20:36,349 --> 01:20:38,589
Civilian Haha is out.

2193
01:20:38,820 --> 01:20:41,420
- What? - Civilian Haha is out.

2194
01:20:42,219 --> 01:20:44,189
(Kwang Soo was with them just a moment ago.)

2195
01:20:44,189 --> 01:20:45,189
What was he?

2196
01:20:45,189 --> 01:20:46,189
(This means...)

2197
01:20:46,189 --> 01:20:47,299
Civilian?

2198
01:20:47,900 --> 01:20:49,429
Civilian Haha is out.

2199
01:20:49,429 --> 01:20:53,500
(Is Haha out?)

2200
01:20:56,099 --> 01:20:58,710
(It's time for me to step in.)

2201
01:20:58,710 --> 01:21:00,809
A good agent got eliminated.

2202
01:21:00,809 --> 01:21:02,009
(Is he acting?)

2203
01:21:02,540 --> 01:21:04,009
(What?)

2204
01:21:05,009 --> 01:21:07,080
(He suddenly begins to warm up.)

2205
01:21:07,080 --> 01:21:10,150
(Creaking)

2206
01:21:12,290 --> 01:21:15,219
(He stops due to back pain.)

2207
01:21:17,660 --> 01:21:20,089
Gosh, why is it so heavy?

2208
01:21:23,599 --> 01:21:25,429
(What?)

2209
01:21:26,769 --> 01:21:32,070
(He resumes warming up.)

2210
01:21:33,009 --> 01:21:36,610
(This is how an actor warms up.)

2211
01:21:36,780 --> 01:21:39,809
(He sets out to catch a thief.)

2212
01:21:40,210 --> 01:21:42,080
(Forger Ha Nee and Thief B...)

2213
01:21:42,080 --> 01:21:43,889
(versus Police Seung Ryong and civilians)

2214
01:21:43,889 --> 01:21:47,290
Seung Ryong can't be seen anywhere.

2215
01:21:48,259 --> 01:21:50,320
(1 forger, 1 thief,)

2216
01:21:50,320 --> 01:21:53,460
(1 police, and 4 civilians remain.)

2217
01:21:53,460 --> 01:21:56,160
Gong Myoung, I need to level up.

2218
01:21:56,160 --> 01:21:57,599
- Okay. - Help me.

2219
01:21:58,099 --> 01:22:00,740
(The thief and forger just need to catch the police.)

2220
01:22:01,139 --> 01:22:05,009
(Let's catch a thief.)

2221
01:22:06,240 --> 01:22:08,240
(Seung Ryong suddenly ties his shoelaces.)

2222
01:22:08,240 --> 01:22:11,780
(His preparations are neverending.)

2223
01:22:11,780 --> 01:22:13,309
My shoelaces keep coming undone.

2224
01:22:16,219 --> 01:22:17,549
I didn't think...

2225
01:22:17,549 --> 01:22:18,549
(At that moment)

2226
01:22:18,549 --> 01:22:19,790
Seung Ryong.

2227
01:22:19,790 --> 01:22:21,519
(Ha Nee spots Seung Ryong.)

2228
01:22:21,519 --> 01:22:22,660
Seung Ryong.

2229
01:22:22,660 --> 01:22:23,689
Ha Nee.

2230
01:22:24,689 --> 01:22:26,689
- Seriously... - What is it?

2231
01:22:27,160 --> 01:22:28,900
Sun Kyu got eliminated.

2232
01:22:29,759 --> 01:22:31,370
- Who? - Sun Kyu got eliminated.

2233
01:22:31,370 --> 01:22:32,469
Who eliminated him?

2234
01:22:33,170 --> 01:22:34,200
(How will I rip off his name tag?)

2235
01:22:34,200 --> 01:22:35,400
Come on.

2236
01:22:36,240 --> 01:22:37,540
Come on.

2237
01:22:37,769 --> 01:22:39,439
(They face each other at a dead-end.)

2238
01:22:39,439 --> 01:22:40,740
You are the police, right?

2239
01:22:40,740 --> 01:22:42,179
- Yes. - Be honest.

2240
01:22:42,179 --> 01:22:45,349
(Rip off the other's name tag or get your name tag ripped off.)

2241
01:22:45,349 --> 01:22:46,410
Come on.

2242
01:22:46,410 --> 01:22:49,019
(It's time to put an end to this.)

2243
01:22:49,019 --> 01:22:50,049
Come on.

2244
01:22:50,049 --> 01:22:52,290
(They begin.)

2245
01:22:53,820 --> 01:22:58,089
(If Seung Ryong's name tag gets removed, Team Thieves win.)

2246
01:22:58,830 --> 01:23:00,729
(To remove his name tag, she should have borrowed his pen.)

2247
01:23:00,729 --> 01:23:02,700
I need to write it down since I am stupid.

2248
01:23:02,700 --> 01:23:04,729
(Right after Seung Ryong confessed his identity to Ha Nee)

2249
01:23:05,929 --> 01:23:07,299
Let me borrow your pen.

2250
01:23:09,000 --> 01:23:10,710
Let me borrow your pen.

2251
01:23:10,710 --> 01:23:12,769
- Don't you have a pen? - No, I don't.

2252
01:23:12,769 --> 01:23:18,049
(Trusting Ha Nee to be a civilian, Seung Ryong let her use it.)

2253
01:23:18,809 --> 01:23:22,019
(Ha Nee made all preparations.)

2254
01:23:24,189 --> 01:23:26,650
(It's a golden opportunity.)

2255
01:23:28,219 --> 01:23:30,660
(She must seize it.)

2256
01:23:33,229 --> 01:23:35,330
(Grabbing)

2257
01:23:35,729 --> 01:23:37,500
(The one who grabbed Seung Ryong's name tag is...)

2258
01:23:37,500 --> 01:23:39,299
(Gong Myoung.)

2259
01:23:39,500 --> 01:23:43,469
(Gong Myoung comes to protect Seung Ryong's name tag.)

2260
01:23:43,469 --> 01:23:44,610
Hey.

2261
01:23:44,610 --> 01:23:45,969
- Come on. - Who is it?

2262
01:23:46,469 --> 01:23:47,679
Who is it?

2263
01:23:47,679 --> 01:23:48,939
Come on.

2264
01:23:48,939 --> 01:23:50,280
Get Ha Nee's name tag.

2265
01:23:50,280 --> 01:23:51,549
No. No!

2266
01:23:54,019 --> 01:23:56,650
(Forger Lee Ha Nee is out.)

2267
01:23:56,650 --> 01:23:57,889
I am sorry, Ha Nee.

2268
01:23:57,889 --> 01:23:59,150
All right.

2269
01:23:59,620 --> 01:24:01,120
Ha Nee, you...

2270
01:24:01,120 --> 01:24:03,889
(I was so close to ripping off his name tag.)

2271
01:24:03,960 --> 01:24:05,559
- What is she? - What is she?

2272
01:24:05,790 --> 01:24:07,700
Ha Nee is the forger.

2273
01:24:07,700 --> 01:24:09,129
- She is the forger. - Really?

2274
01:24:09,500 --> 01:24:11,570
Is it even possible to rip off your name tag?

2275
01:24:11,570 --> 01:24:12,969
- Ha Nee isn't the forger. - It won't come off.

2276
01:24:12,969 --> 01:24:14,240
- See? - Are you the forger?

2277
01:24:14,240 --> 01:24:15,299
I am the forger.

2278
01:24:15,469 --> 01:24:16,700
Help me up.

2279
01:24:17,370 --> 01:24:19,040
Ha Nee is the forger.

2280
01:24:19,040 --> 01:24:20,679
- It didn't get ripped off? - No, it didn't.

2281
01:24:20,979 --> 01:24:22,710
(Grabbing)

2282
01:24:24,009 --> 01:24:27,450
(Kwang Soo aims for Seung Ryong's name tag.)

2283
01:24:27,849 --> 01:24:30,790
(That means Kwang Soo is...)

2284
01:24:30,790 --> 01:24:32,719
(Thief)

2285
01:24:32,719 --> 01:24:37,019
(Kwang Soo is the other thief.)

2286
01:24:37,019 --> 01:24:38,790
I'll think of this as the last chance.

2287
01:24:39,759 --> 01:24:43,259
Those who were eliminated were So Min and...

2288
01:24:44,129 --> 01:24:46,570
Gosh, my legs hurt. Seung Ryong, Sun Kyu...

2289
01:24:46,570 --> 01:24:47,599
(Kwang Soo got to work when Ha Nee borrowed Haha's pen.)

2290
01:24:47,599 --> 01:24:49,299
- Ha Nee! Ha Nee! - What is going on?

2291
01:24:49,370 --> 01:24:51,370
What is going on? What are you doing?

2292
01:24:51,439 --> 01:24:53,040
- What are you doing? - Grab his body.

2293
01:24:53,040 --> 01:24:55,210
Grab his body. Grab his body.

2294
01:24:55,210 --> 01:24:57,910
(Kwang Soo and Ha Nee succeeded to remove Haha's name tag.)

2295
01:24:57,910 --> 01:24:59,110
Grab his body.

2296
01:24:59,610 --> 01:25:00,750
(Kwang Soo and Ha Nee's perfect teamwork)

2297
01:25:00,750 --> 01:25:01,920
What was that?

2298
01:25:04,650 --> 01:25:06,019
Is she the forger?

2299
01:25:06,719 --> 01:25:08,960
Hurry up and run away.

2300
01:25:09,189 --> 01:25:10,490
Hurry up and run away.

2301
01:25:12,290 --> 01:25:13,330
No, it didn't.

2302
01:25:14,559 --> 01:25:17,099
(He will win if he removes Seung Ryong's name tag.)

2303
01:25:20,070 --> 01:25:21,299
(Slipping)

2304
01:25:23,170 --> 01:25:25,269
(They protect Seung Ryong's name tag.)

2305
01:25:26,469 --> 01:25:28,809
(The tables are turned.)

2306
01:25:30,009 --> 01:25:31,309
I got his hands.

2307
01:25:33,379 --> 01:25:34,420
(Gong Myoung removes Kwang Soo's name tag.)

2308
01:25:34,420 --> 01:25:35,679
Did you rip it off?

2309
01:25:35,679 --> 01:25:38,490
- Hey! - Oh, you should have done it.

2310
01:25:38,589 --> 01:25:42,189
(The last thief, Kwang Soo is out.)

2311
01:25:42,189 --> 01:25:43,490
Gong Myoung removed it.

2312
01:25:43,889 --> 01:25:45,189
She didn't get to level up.

2313
01:25:45,189 --> 01:25:46,490
I was close.

2314
01:25:46,490 --> 01:25:48,129
- I see. - I was close.

2315
01:25:48,229 --> 01:25:49,900
I know. We were close.

2316
01:25:49,900 --> 01:25:51,229
It's okay.

2317
01:25:51,599 --> 01:25:53,269
You might be okay, but I'm...

2318
01:25:53,269 --> 01:25:54,299
(He grits his teeth.)

2319
01:25:55,339 --> 01:25:57,139
I am Level Zero now!

2320
01:25:57,139 --> 01:25:59,269
(How am I Level 0 despite working hard all day?)

2321
01:25:59,410 --> 01:26:00,469
I mean...

2322
01:26:00,639 --> 01:26:03,040
I was leading the race by myself.

2323
01:26:03,540 --> 01:26:04,910
That serves you right.

2324
01:26:04,910 --> 01:26:07,179
(You shouldn't have been greedy.)

2325
01:26:08,950 --> 01:26:11,420
It was the third episode of the Level Up Race.

2326
01:26:11,549 --> 01:26:14,259
The final victory of the Level Fabrication Incident...

2327
01:26:14,259 --> 01:26:15,960
goes to Team Civilian and Team Police.

2328
01:26:16,320 --> 01:26:17,629
We did it.

2329
01:26:18,490 --> 01:26:22,559
(This is the highlight of starring on Running Man.)

2330
01:26:22,559 --> 01:26:25,370
(That was so close. We almost had it.)

2331
01:26:25,370 --> 01:26:26,969
- We won. - We won in the end.

2332
01:26:27,330 --> 01:26:29,439
The hidden police officer was Ryu Seung Ryong.

2333
01:26:29,439 --> 01:26:31,370
This is a new style. He's the king of stakeouts.

2334
01:26:31,370 --> 01:26:32,469
Yes, I was on a stakeout.

2335
01:26:32,469 --> 01:26:33,540
I didn't see him once.

2336
01:26:33,540 --> 01:26:35,509
- I never saw him too. - He was so good.

2337
01:26:35,540 --> 01:26:37,439
Where were you hiding at?

2338
01:26:37,439 --> 01:26:39,879
He was in the darkest corner of the wardrobe department.

2339
01:26:40,650 --> 01:26:43,250
The thieves were Jae Seok and Kwang Soo.

2340
01:26:43,250 --> 01:26:44,450
(The thieves were Jae Seok and Kwang Soo.)

2341
01:26:44,450 --> 01:26:45,620
(Their levels reset to Level 0.)

2342
01:26:45,620 --> 01:26:47,820
- My goodness. - You did steal the levels,

2343
01:26:47,920 --> 01:26:50,689
but you failed to win the race. Your levels will be...

2344
01:26:50,820 --> 01:26:52,589
- zero. - My goodness.

2345
01:26:53,259 --> 01:26:54,729
No one reached Level 10, right?

2346
01:26:56,599 --> 01:27:00,330
- Okay. - And Haha eliminated Jae Seok.

2347
01:27:01,040 --> 01:27:04,339
You will be Level 6 as your level increased by 2.

2348
01:27:04,339 --> 01:27:06,839
(He reached Level 6 after getting Jae Seok's levels.)

2349
01:27:06,839 --> 01:27:08,080
This is so rewarding.

2350
01:27:13,110 --> 01:27:15,750
Even if our level is zero, we still have a chance, right?

2351
01:27:15,750 --> 01:27:18,349
- That's right. - Let me try this one more time.

2352
01:27:18,349 --> 01:27:20,150
(I still have one shot left.)

2353
01:27:20,960 --> 01:27:22,620
- One more shot. Okay! - I'm starting again!

2354
01:27:22,620 --> 01:27:24,860
- I'm starting afresh! - It counts starting now.

2355
01:27:24,860 --> 01:27:27,700
- Let's go, go, go! - Next week will be a new beginning!

2356
01:27:28,660 --> 01:27:33,229
The winning guests will receive a prize.

2357
01:27:33,969 --> 01:27:35,269
Here comes the pure gold.

2358
01:27:35,969 --> 01:27:38,610
I can still win a prize after doing such a bad job?

2359
01:27:38,740 --> 01:27:40,740
Four of them will get it except for Ha Nee.

2360
01:27:40,740 --> 01:27:42,339
I'm jealous.

2361
01:27:42,379 --> 01:27:44,549
- I'm jealous. - My goodness.

2362
01:27:44,549 --> 01:27:46,080
(The prize is a gold sheriff badge.)

2363
01:27:46,080 --> 01:27:48,019
- Hey, this is... - Gosh.

2364
01:27:48,019 --> 01:27:49,549
I'm sure they'll give you one too.

2365
01:27:49,549 --> 01:27:50,650
No.

2366
01:27:50,750 --> 01:27:52,389
(We thank the guests for running so hard with us since the morning.)

2367
01:27:52,389 --> 01:27:54,049
Thank you once again. Thank you.

2368
01:27:54,049 --> 01:27:55,320
Thank you.

2369
01:27:56,019 --> 01:27:57,990
- Level 0! - Level 0!

2370
01:27:57,990 --> 01:28:00,360
- Look forward to next week! - This is just the beginning!
