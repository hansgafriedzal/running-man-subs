1
00:00:06,823 --> 00:00:09,690
(The Year of the Golden Pig)

2
00:00:09,693 --> 00:00:15,355
(It unfolds at a traditional house where the tradition is evident.)

3
00:00:15,699 --> 00:00:17,460
- Soon, it will be... - Yes?

4
00:00:17,467 --> 00:00:18,930
- the Lunar New Year. - That's right.

5
00:00:18,935 --> 00:00:21,100
- We must offer our greetings. - Yes.

6
00:00:21,104 --> 00:00:23,600
It's 2019, the Year of the Golden Pig.

7
00:00:23,607 --> 00:00:25,700
- Happy New Year. - Happy New Year.

8
00:00:25,709 --> 00:00:28,640
(Why are they bowing down all of a sudden?)

9
00:00:28,645 --> 00:00:31,280
- Hold on. - Give us a heads-up.

10
00:00:31,281 --> 00:00:35,050
- Goodness, come on. Seriously. - Okay.

11
00:00:35,052 --> 00:00:37,880
- Happy New Year. - He caught us off guard.

12
00:00:37,888 --> 00:00:40,450
- This is at last... - Come on.

13
00:00:40,457 --> 00:00:42,490
- Seok Jin's year. He's 54. - Right.

14
00:00:42,492 --> 00:00:46,930
- It's started. - 54. Bring in happiness and luck.

15
00:00:46,930 --> 00:00:49,655
(Acting silly)

16
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:52,155
He's in a good mood today.

17
00:00:52,736 --> 00:00:54,770
- I think he'll get tired easily. - Hey, this was nothing.

18
00:00:54,771 --> 00:00:56,270
I think he'll get tired easily.

19
00:00:56,273 --> 00:00:57,870
- He's already tired. - He's tired.

20
00:00:57,874 --> 00:01:01,940
Right now, Haha caught a cold.

21
00:01:01,945 --> 00:01:04,680
- Right. Goodness. Poor him. - He's not in good health.

22
00:01:04,681 --> 00:01:06,280
- It's my fault. I wasn't careful. - Really?

23
00:01:06,283 --> 00:01:08,445
I was really worried as soon as I got here.

24
00:01:08,485 --> 00:01:11,075
That's why Jong Kook is standing far from him.

25
00:01:11,121 --> 00:01:12,680
- That's not it. - Usually...

26
00:01:12,689 --> 00:01:15,490
(Is it because he might catch it too?)

27
00:01:15,492 --> 00:01:17,690
- That's not it. - Usually, he's right next to Haha.

28
00:01:17,694 --> 00:01:19,690
When Haha came into the room this morning,

29
00:01:19,696 --> 00:01:22,230
he went, "Poor you. You caught a cold."

30
00:01:22,232 --> 00:01:24,660
- "Are you okay?" - No, no.

31
00:01:24,668 --> 00:01:27,825
When I said we should work hard, he just gently tapped my fist.

32
00:01:28,505 --> 00:01:30,240
- That disappointed me. - He doesn't want to catch a cold.

33
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:32,740
It's been a while since we wore these traditional clothes.

34
00:01:32,742 --> 00:01:34,940
- It really has been a while. - That's right.

35
00:01:34,945 --> 00:01:37,680
It's been a while since I saw you in the traditional dress.

36
00:01:37,681 --> 00:01:38,940
- It's been a while. - Yes.

37
00:01:38,949 --> 00:01:41,080
Did you two fight? Why aren't you standing together?

38
00:01:41,084 --> 00:01:44,645
(Did you two fight? Why aren't you standing together?)

39
00:01:44,654 --> 00:01:47,490
(Standing far)

40
00:01:47,491 --> 00:01:50,390
- They're cooling off on purpose. - From Jong Kook.

41
00:01:50,393 --> 00:01:52,260
- This is done on purpose? - They must take it slow.

42
00:01:52,262 --> 00:01:54,690
She's Jong Kook's first love interest on our show,

43
00:01:54,698 --> 00:01:56,425
- Jong Kook is her second. - That's right.

44
00:01:56,566 --> 00:01:58,560
That's not a bad thing. It's not.

45
00:01:58,568 --> 00:01:59,660
- Ji Hyo... - Jong Kook.

46
00:01:59,669 --> 00:02:02,270
Jong Kook was on our show even before that happened.

47
00:02:02,272 --> 00:02:05,470
Ji Hyo has to be a bit careful. She needs to be careful.

48
00:02:05,475 --> 00:02:06,810
Her previous love interest...

49
00:02:06,810 --> 00:02:08,370
- got married. - Yes, that's right.

50
00:02:08,378 --> 00:02:10,680
It's all neat. It is.

51
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:12,380
- But we must congratulate. - This is amazing.

52
00:02:12,382 --> 00:02:13,975
We should definitely congratulate them.

53
00:02:13,984 --> 00:02:15,980
Listen. Say that you pair up with a lady.

54
00:02:15,986 --> 00:02:18,180
Are you nice to them or not?

55
00:02:18,188 --> 00:02:19,850
- I'm nice to them. - I must obviously take care of her.

56
00:02:19,856 --> 00:02:20,950
Whenever I do something,

57
00:02:20,957 --> 00:02:23,520
- you go all like this. - You act tough, but you're gentle.

58
00:02:23,527 --> 00:02:25,855
(You're so coy.)

59
00:02:25,896 --> 00:02:28,430
(Everything ends with Jong Kook and Ji Hyo's love interest.)

60
00:02:28,431 --> 00:02:30,900
Love is power. Love is power.

61
00:02:30,901 --> 00:02:33,630
- Hold her hand! - Hold her hand!

62
00:02:33,637 --> 00:02:36,665
- Hold her hand! - He'll hit you.

63
00:02:36,740 --> 00:02:37,800
- He's a loving giraffe. - You won't hold hands?

64
00:02:37,807 --> 00:02:40,410
- I'll keep an eye on you. - Come on, Kwang Soo.

65
00:02:40,410 --> 00:02:43,340
- He wants everyone to be in love. - He's so interested in love.

66
00:02:43,346 --> 00:02:46,180
Today's special is for the Lunar New Year.

67
00:02:46,183 --> 00:02:48,580
Four special guests have come to our show.

68
00:02:48,585 --> 00:02:50,645
- Really? - Who are they?

69
00:02:50,887 --> 00:02:52,150
Are they coming out?

70
00:02:52,155 --> 00:02:53,590
What's going on? Look.

71
00:02:53,590 --> 00:02:55,220
I can't believe this.

72
00:02:55,225 --> 00:02:56,920
- My goodness. - It's been a while.

73
00:02:56,927 --> 00:02:58,990
- She's pretty. - Goodness.

74
00:02:58,995 --> 00:03:00,260
- What's going on? - Goodness.

75
00:03:00,263 --> 00:03:01,760
Il Woo. A Ra.

76
00:03:01,765 --> 00:03:05,060
- My gosh, she's pretty! - I can't believe this.

77
00:03:05,068 --> 00:03:06,930
- Kwon Yul and Park Hoon are here. - Unbelievable.

78
00:03:06,937 --> 00:03:09,000
- This is like a painting. - Goodness.

79
00:03:09,005 --> 00:03:11,270
I am that lowly prince.

80
00:03:11,274 --> 00:03:13,870
(It's life story of Yeongjo, )

81
00:03:13,877 --> 00:03:17,010
(a son of a lowly maid becoming the king.)

82
00:03:17,013 --> 00:03:22,475
(The drama, "Haechi" will premier on February 11.)

83
00:03:22,919 --> 00:03:24,650
- Hello. - Hi.

84
00:03:24,654 --> 00:03:27,320
- A Ra. Long time no see. - Goodness.

85
00:03:27,324 --> 00:03:28,650
- Have you been well? - Hello, A Ra.

86
00:03:28,658 --> 00:03:30,220
- Happy New Year. - Happy New Year.

87
00:03:30,227 --> 00:03:32,490
- Long time no see. - Happy New Year.

88
00:03:32,495 --> 00:03:35,085
- Hello. - Happy New Year.

89
00:03:35,098 --> 00:03:36,460
They look great in traditional outfits.

90
00:03:36,466 --> 00:03:37,660
- They look great in these outfits. - They look really nice.

91
00:03:37,667 --> 00:03:40,230
- They look great in these. - Exactly.

92
00:03:40,237 --> 00:03:42,730
- I agree. I agree. - The upper garment looks pretty.

93
00:03:42,739 --> 00:03:46,465
I would like the four of you to say hello to our viewers.

94
00:03:46,476 --> 00:03:48,470
- Hello. - Okay.

95
00:03:48,478 --> 00:03:51,510
- I haven't been here for a while. - It's been a while.

96
00:03:51,514 --> 00:03:54,010
(The queen of beauty, Go A Ra)

97
00:03:54,017 --> 00:03:55,680
Give it back!

98
00:03:55,685 --> 00:03:59,515
(Behind her beautiful looks, she has unexpected charms.)

99
00:03:59,990 --> 00:04:04,590
(This beautiful lady ruled the show with all of her hidden talents.)

100
00:04:04,594 --> 00:04:06,390
A Ra has been in the entertainment industry for 17 years.

101
00:04:06,396 --> 00:04:08,490
- 17 years? - It's been so long.

102
00:04:08,498 --> 00:04:10,400
- You're surprised too. - I didn't know either.

103
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:13,270
- You've had many roles so far. - Right.

104
00:04:13,270 --> 00:04:15,230
Is there a role you'd like to try out?

105
00:04:15,238 --> 00:04:18,270
- I want to do one with romance. - Romance.

106
00:04:18,275 --> 00:04:20,310
Your roles have never been in love?

107
00:04:20,310 --> 00:04:22,240
- You've never had those roles? - You've done it before.

108
00:04:22,245 --> 00:04:24,040
- Really? - You had a lot of those roles.

109
00:04:24,047 --> 00:04:25,940
- You had a lot of those roles. - I want passionate romance.

110
00:04:25,949 --> 00:04:27,945
I see.

111
00:04:28,184 --> 00:04:29,410
(That's a great genre.)

112
00:04:29,419 --> 00:04:31,620
- Like having a lot of kiss scenes? - Passionate romance.

113
00:04:31,621 --> 00:04:33,180
What about passionate romance?

114
00:04:33,189 --> 00:04:35,020
I'm Zo In Sung's fan.

115
00:04:35,025 --> 00:04:38,085
(That came out of nowhere.)

116
00:04:38,895 --> 00:04:40,790
- Why is she saying that now here? - What's going on?

117
00:04:40,797 --> 00:04:43,060
(She's revealing her support all of a sudden.)

118
00:04:43,066 --> 00:04:45,230
- You're his fan? - I would like to do the project...

119
00:04:45,235 --> 00:04:46,970
- with him. - With In Sung?

120
00:04:46,970 --> 00:04:50,040
- I would love to do it with him. - By the way,

121
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:51,300
from Il Woo's point of view,

122
00:04:51,308 --> 00:04:53,770
even if you disguise as a man in the drama,

123
00:04:53,777 --> 00:04:55,770
- he would've been offended. - I mean...

124
00:04:55,779 --> 00:04:57,780
- The romance... - Really.

125
00:04:57,781 --> 00:05:01,675
Even before the drama airs, you showed your support for In Sung.

126
00:05:01,785 --> 00:05:03,280
(And as for the passionate romance...)

127
00:05:03,286 --> 00:05:07,050
Actually, an actress from our show is in passionate romance now.

128
00:05:07,057 --> 00:05:08,650
- It's Jong Kook and Ji Hyo. - It's happening now.

129
00:05:08,658 --> 00:05:11,520
No, no. Not at all. It's not true.

130
00:05:11,528 --> 00:05:13,690
- It's Jong Kook and Ji Hyo. - This is completely not true.

131
00:05:13,697 --> 00:05:15,860
They started talking about this only since yesterday.

132
00:05:15,865 --> 00:05:17,160
It's not true?

133
00:05:17,167 --> 00:05:20,125
- Isn't this romantic comedy? - Kwang Soo...

134
00:05:20,203 --> 00:05:22,300
Il Woo, please say hello to our viewers.

135
00:05:22,305 --> 00:05:24,500
- It's been so long, Il Woo. - How long has it been?

136
00:05:24,507 --> 00:05:27,740
Right. After I got discharged from the military,

137
00:05:27,744 --> 00:05:30,210
Running Man is my first variety show.

138
00:05:30,213 --> 00:05:33,005
- Nice to see you. - That's great.

139
00:05:34,050 --> 00:05:38,545
(He has a 100 percent accuracy in winning over women's hearts.)

140
00:05:38,855 --> 00:05:40,590
Put it in. Put it in there.

141
00:05:40,590 --> 00:05:46,090
(With his fierce competitiveness, he won all of the games as well.)

142
00:05:46,096 --> 00:05:47,530
- Great. - That's it.

143
00:05:47,530 --> 00:05:50,460
(His competitiveness was evident in Dubai too.)

144
00:05:50,467 --> 00:05:54,370
(This manly guy takes it to the end when he starts something.)

145
00:05:54,371 --> 00:05:55,670
Hello, I'm Jung Il Woo.

146
00:05:55,672 --> 00:05:56,970
Congratulations on your discharge.

147
00:05:56,973 --> 00:06:00,470
All right. Tell us how you think. Is this your first time...

148
00:06:00,477 --> 00:06:02,210
- working with A Ra? - Yes, that's right.

149
00:06:02,212 --> 00:06:04,110
After working with her, what kind of actress do you think she is?

150
00:06:04,114 --> 00:06:06,180
- A Ra? - Describe her in three words.

151
00:06:06,182 --> 00:06:07,380
Go ahead.

152
00:06:07,384 --> 00:06:09,275
- Go A Ra is... - Go A Ra is?

153
00:06:09,419 --> 00:06:11,345
- A Ra is... - A Ra is?

154
00:06:13,590 --> 00:06:16,990
- Your time is up. - Okay.

155
00:06:16,993 --> 00:06:18,120
Is this it?

156
00:06:18,128 --> 00:06:19,120
(Is this it?)

157
00:06:19,129 --> 00:06:20,290
- All right. - Fine.

158
00:06:20,296 --> 00:06:22,790
There are a lot he could've said. "Cute, pretty, and kind".

159
00:06:22,799 --> 00:06:23,800
Is this it?

160
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:24,800
(Sorry, I couldn't think of anything.)

161
00:06:24,801 --> 00:06:27,930
Describe Il Woo from your point of view in three-syllable words.

162
00:06:27,937 --> 00:06:29,300
- 1, 2, 3. - He's good-looking.

163
00:06:29,305 --> 00:06:30,470
He's good-looking?

164
00:06:30,473 --> 00:06:31,870
(To her, he's good-looking.)

165
00:06:31,875 --> 00:06:33,140
- Three. - He's good-looking.

166
00:06:33,143 --> 00:06:35,870
(Yes, you are my love interest in the drama.)

167
00:06:35,879 --> 00:06:37,475
What about In Sung?

168
00:06:37,580 --> 00:06:38,580
I love you.

169
00:06:38,581 --> 00:06:42,405
(Her love for him doesn't falter.)

170
00:06:42,786 --> 00:06:43,880
That was perfect. It worked perfectly.

171
00:06:43,887 --> 00:06:46,650
- "I love you." - That had three syllables. Perfect.

172
00:06:46,656 --> 00:06:48,650
- It was perfect. - It was perfect.

173
00:06:48,658 --> 00:06:50,890
All of a sudden, I feel like crying.

174
00:06:50,894 --> 00:06:52,290
Look at his face. Hey.

175
00:06:52,295 --> 00:06:54,590
- Look at his face. - Right now...

176
00:06:54,597 --> 00:06:56,330
- This is passionate romance. - That was perfect.

177
00:06:56,332 --> 00:06:58,460
You star in a lot of historical dramas.

178
00:06:58,468 --> 00:06:59,560
Yes, this is my fourth one.

179
00:06:59,569 --> 00:07:01,370
- This genre suits you well. - I agree.

180
00:07:01,371 --> 00:07:04,870
What are charms of the historical dramas unlike modern-day dramas?

181
00:07:04,874 --> 00:07:07,940
We wear traditional clothes instead of modern-day clothes.

182
00:07:07,944 --> 00:07:09,910
And these clothes are comfortable.

183
00:07:09,913 --> 00:07:12,180
- They are comfortable? Really? - You wear traditional clothes.

184
00:07:12,182 --> 00:07:15,180
In winter, I can layer up a lot of clothes.

185
00:07:15,185 --> 00:07:17,250
I can wear about seven long johns underneath.

186
00:07:17,253 --> 00:07:19,680
If so, why are you wearing dressy shoes? You're the only one.

187
00:07:19,689 --> 00:07:23,590
(If so, why are you wearing dressy shoes? You're the only one.)

188
00:07:23,593 --> 00:07:25,120
- You were trying to look cool. - Hey.

189
00:07:25,128 --> 00:07:26,320
- Was it because it's uncomfortable? - Hey.

190
00:07:26,329 --> 00:07:27,760
Hey, he's trying to look cool.

191
00:07:27,764 --> 00:07:29,990
- I mean, listen. - Hey.

192
00:07:29,999 --> 00:07:31,730
No, he didn't wear them to look cool.

193
00:07:31,734 --> 00:07:34,130
- Will you make him cry today? - No.

194
00:07:34,137 --> 00:07:36,130
- I wondered if it's uncomfortable. - He's already having a hard time.

195
00:07:36,139 --> 00:07:38,400
- I thought he meant something else. - He's trying to look cool.

196
00:07:38,408 --> 00:07:40,070
- Because of A Ra... - Everyone else wore the same shoes.

197
00:07:40,076 --> 00:07:42,065
That style is from the late era of Joseon Dynasty.

198
00:07:42,145 --> 00:07:44,380
- We're wearing traditional ones. - No, it's like...

199
00:07:44,380 --> 00:07:46,480
- His is from the late era. - He looks like a butcher.

200
00:07:46,483 --> 00:07:48,505
His outfit is from the late era of Joseon Dynasty.

201
00:07:48,785 --> 00:07:51,315
- I'm about to lose it. - What's wrong with him?

202
00:07:51,321 --> 00:07:54,945
Il Woo just said that he's about to lose it.

203
00:07:55,358 --> 00:07:57,260
- He's attacked. - He's lost it.

204
00:07:57,260 --> 00:07:58,690
- He's attacked at full force. - Yes, he was.

205
00:07:58,695 --> 00:08:01,860
We'll stop interviewing Il Woo.

206
00:08:01,865 --> 00:08:03,730
- Will we stop here? - Yes, we will.

207
00:08:03,733 --> 00:08:06,730
We will stop interviewing Il Woo for the time being.

208
00:08:06,736 --> 00:08:07,730
We'll leave him in this state?

209
00:08:07,737 --> 00:08:09,870
- Next guest is Kwon Yul. - Kwon Yul.

210
00:08:09,873 --> 00:08:11,500
- He looks so cool. - He's the general.

211
00:08:11,508 --> 00:08:14,605
(Good-looking guy with many charms, Kwon Yul)

212
00:08:14,677 --> 00:08:17,675
(With his prince-like look, he releases all of his manly sides.)

213
00:08:18,147 --> 00:08:22,645
(He was all over the place when he was on our show 3 years ago.)

214
00:08:22,886 --> 00:08:29,185
(His unexpected charms threw the members into a frenzy.)

215
00:08:29,826 --> 00:08:32,715
- Nice to see you. I'm Kwon Yul. - Nice to see you.

216
00:08:32,795 --> 00:08:35,060
- Kwon Yul. His name is so cool. - He's so cool.

217
00:08:35,064 --> 00:08:36,430
He has a name of a general.

218
00:08:36,432 --> 00:08:38,895
Has it been three years for you too since the last time?

219
00:08:39,202 --> 00:08:41,030
(He's clapping all of a sudden by himself.)

220
00:08:41,037 --> 00:08:42,665
Gosh, what is this?

221
00:08:43,039 --> 00:08:45,200
(He's unpredictable.)

222
00:08:45,208 --> 00:08:46,470
Tell you what.

223
00:08:46,476 --> 00:08:48,310
- I read this about Yul. - Okay.

224
00:08:48,311 --> 00:08:50,710
He has gone viral with his sweet voice...

225
00:08:50,713 --> 00:08:52,435
- and great singing skills. - Really?

226
00:08:52,482 --> 00:08:54,980
Then could you sing us a song?

227
00:08:54,984 --> 00:08:56,110
That was sudden.

228
00:08:56,119 --> 00:08:57,150
- Let's hear you sing. - My gosh.

229
00:08:57,153 --> 00:08:58,780
He has a low-pitched voice.

230
00:08:58,788 --> 00:09:00,990
(If you want me to sing, I'll sing.)

231
00:09:00,990 --> 00:09:02,050
I'll sing Yoo Jae Ha's song.

232
00:09:02,058 --> 00:09:03,290
- Great. - Goodness.

233
00:09:03,293 --> 00:09:04,420
I love his songs.

234
00:09:04,427 --> 00:09:06,560
- "Myself Reflected in My Heart". - "Myself Reflected in My Heart".

235
00:09:06,563 --> 00:09:07,790
I love that song.

236
00:09:07,797 --> 00:09:09,130
(It's as if he prepared to sing.)

237
00:09:09,132 --> 00:09:12,460
(Pieces of dreams I cannot hold onto)

238
00:09:12,468 --> 00:09:14,600
- He has a great voice. - His voice sounds great.

239
00:09:14,604 --> 00:09:17,870
They disappear one by one

240
00:09:17,874 --> 00:09:19,000
(Getting into the song by himself)

241
00:09:19,008 --> 00:09:23,370
I keep getting lost without an end

242
00:09:23,379 --> 00:09:27,235
(Puzzled)

243
00:09:27,750 --> 00:09:32,015
(Everyone starts singing.)

244
00:09:32,689 --> 00:09:35,950
(Everyone is getting into the rhythm. This looks like...)

245
00:09:35,959 --> 00:09:38,985
It's "Challenge 1000 Songs" ' Lunar New Year Special.

246
00:09:39,963 --> 00:09:41,990
(Reply "Challenge 1000 Songs")

247
00:09:41,998 --> 00:09:44,855
- Yes, it's really nice. - The unfinished part

248
00:09:44,901 --> 00:09:47,930
(It's nice and all, )

249
00:09:47,937 --> 00:09:51,765
(but until when will he sing?)

250
00:09:52,875 --> 00:09:55,810
(He finishes the song after enjoying it alone.)

251
00:09:55,812 --> 00:09:57,440
He's great.

252
00:09:57,447 --> 00:10:00,010
- Actually, he has a great voice. - He has a great voice.

253
00:10:00,016 --> 00:10:01,310
He has such a great voice.

254
00:10:01,317 --> 00:10:03,010
- His voice is pleasing to hear. - That's right.

255
00:10:03,019 --> 00:10:04,620
What did you say?

256
00:10:04,621 --> 00:10:06,450
Be honest. You weren't sure earlier.

257
00:10:06,456 --> 00:10:08,120
- You didn't look impressed. - This is what you did.

258
00:10:08,124 --> 00:10:10,190
This is what Kwang Soo did, facing me.

259
00:10:10,193 --> 00:10:11,820
(Holding down his laughter)

260
00:10:11,828 --> 00:10:13,520
- That's what you did. - You tilted your head.

261
00:10:13,529 --> 00:10:15,285
It's not that. No.

262
00:10:16,132 --> 00:10:18,325
(Tilting his head)

263
00:10:18,601 --> 00:10:21,700
(I can't tell if he's good or not for sure.)

264
00:10:21,704 --> 00:10:23,130
You tilted your head.

265
00:10:23,139 --> 00:10:25,170
- It's not that. He's very good, - You did that.

266
00:10:25,174 --> 00:10:26,870
but I must've had high expectations.

267
00:10:26,876 --> 00:10:29,340
- If you're singing for everyone... - That's right.

268
00:10:29,345 --> 00:10:31,040
- I thought he'd be an opera singer. - I get what you mean.

269
00:10:31,047 --> 00:10:32,840
- I thought he'd sing like this. - Be quiet.

270
00:10:32,849 --> 00:10:34,975
- It didn't reach my expectations. - Be quiet.

271
00:10:34,984 --> 00:10:36,910
- That's right. - Be quiet.

272
00:10:36,919 --> 00:10:38,580
(Kwang Soo had high expectations, and he was overly sentimental.)

273
00:10:38,588 --> 00:10:40,150
When I was singing it, I wasn't sure either.

274
00:10:40,156 --> 00:10:42,885
(Tilting his head)

275
00:10:43,259 --> 00:10:45,890
I've never seen someone sing as long as he did.

276
00:10:45,895 --> 00:10:48,090
- People usually sing the hook. - Seriously.

277
00:10:48,097 --> 00:10:49,990
- He sang from the start. - He said he'd sing only one line.

278
00:10:49,999 --> 00:10:52,100
- He sang the whole verse. - He sang the first verse.

279
00:10:52,101 --> 00:10:53,800
Are you feeling better now?

280
00:10:53,803 --> 00:10:55,130
Yes, the song healed me.

281
00:10:55,138 --> 00:10:58,065
(I'm healed after listening to his singing.)

282
00:10:58,074 --> 00:10:59,700
(His medicinal voice can cure colds.)

283
00:10:59,709 --> 00:11:01,710
This is his first time on Running Man.

284
00:11:01,711 --> 00:11:02,870
- Park Hoon. - Yes.

285
00:11:02,879 --> 00:11:04,480
- Please say hello. - Okay.

286
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:05,710
Hello. I...

287
00:11:05,715 --> 00:11:07,850
Nice to meet you. I am...

288
00:11:07,850 --> 00:11:11,150
here to promote the SBS drama, "Haechi".

289
00:11:11,154 --> 00:11:12,820
- You can't be shy on variety shows. - Is that so?

290
00:11:12,822 --> 00:11:14,720
(Coaching how to be on variety shows)

291
00:11:14,724 --> 00:11:16,520
- He's shy. - You have to be louder.

292
00:11:16,526 --> 00:11:19,390
- That's all right. - My heart is about to explode.

293
00:11:19,395 --> 00:11:22,025
(The most charismatic actor, Park Hoon)

294
00:11:22,398 --> 00:11:24,300
(He's the formula for successful dramas such as...)

295
00:11:24,300 --> 00:11:25,860
("Descendants of the Sun" and "Memories of the Alhambra".)

296
00:11:25,868 --> 00:11:30,625
(His charismatic acting performance has no boundaries.)

297
00:11:30,773 --> 00:11:32,865
Hello, I'm Actor Park Hoon.

298
00:11:34,277 --> 00:11:35,310
Park Hoon.

299
00:11:35,311 --> 00:11:36,740
- He has a cool name. - He has a great voice.

300
00:11:36,746 --> 00:11:39,580
It was one of those names I wanted when I was young.

301
00:11:39,582 --> 00:11:40,950
- Hoon. - Hoon.

302
00:11:40,950 --> 00:11:41,980
- Kim Hoon. - Hoon.

303
00:11:41,984 --> 00:11:43,350
His name has just one syllable.

304
00:11:43,352 --> 00:11:44,950
I really like names like his.

305
00:11:44,954 --> 00:11:46,580
- That's why your nickname is Hyuk. - You have a nickname, Hyuk.

306
00:11:46,589 --> 00:11:48,690
- I'm Hyuk. Hoon. - He's also known as Hyuk.

307
00:11:48,691 --> 00:11:50,020
- I like names like yours. - That's right.

308
00:11:50,026 --> 00:11:51,960
- I love your name. - Me too. Hoon.

309
00:11:51,961 --> 00:11:54,260
I heard that Hoon's role in the drama...

310
00:11:54,263 --> 00:11:56,230
is a beggar.

311
00:11:56,232 --> 00:11:58,155
- I'm a beggar. - A beggar?

312
00:11:58,468 --> 00:12:00,400
If I were to put it in a playful way,

313
00:12:00,403 --> 00:12:02,695
I'm the king of the streets.

314
00:12:02,805 --> 00:12:05,200
It's a story how everyone becomes kings in their places.

315
00:12:05,208 --> 00:12:07,070
To borrow today's terms, I would be an influential blogger.

316
00:12:07,076 --> 00:12:11,010
(To borrow today's terms, I would be an influential blogger.)

317
00:12:11,013 --> 00:12:12,810
- That's right. - That was amazing.

318
00:12:12,815 --> 00:12:14,710
- He shapes the public opinion. - I get it.

319
00:12:14,717 --> 00:12:16,280
- Back in the days, - He's right.

320
00:12:16,285 --> 00:12:18,420
- he would circulate stories. - That's it.

321
00:12:18,421 --> 00:12:19,450
He is right.

322
00:12:19,455 --> 00:12:20,590
That's my role.

323
00:12:20,590 --> 00:12:22,750
(This newbie on variety shows is witty.)

324
00:12:22,759 --> 00:12:25,615
- Hoon has such a likable face. - I agree.

325
00:12:26,129 --> 00:12:27,390
- In what ways? - What?

326
00:12:27,396 --> 00:12:28,530
He has kind eyes.

327
00:12:28,531 --> 00:12:30,360
- I've seen you before. - Where?

328
00:12:30,366 --> 00:12:32,400
(I've seen you before.)

329
00:12:32,401 --> 00:12:34,930
- It has started. - Here we go again.

330
00:12:34,937 --> 00:12:37,440
- Someone saw Seok Jin again. - He can't remember again.

331
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:38,840
- Really? - Yes.

332
00:12:38,841 --> 00:12:40,270
- When? Where did you see him? - I saw him once.

333
00:12:40,276 --> 00:12:41,840
- This is my first time seeing him. - Where was that?

334
00:12:41,844 --> 00:12:43,210
We probably ran into one another.

335
00:12:43,212 --> 00:12:45,580
- No, no. - When did we meet?

336
00:12:45,581 --> 00:12:47,580
- I was on your radio show once. - My goodness.

337
00:12:47,583 --> 00:12:49,550
(I was on your radio show once.)

338
00:12:49,552 --> 00:12:51,320
- My goodness. - It's his radio show again?

339
00:12:51,320 --> 00:12:53,180
- You were on my radio show? - Yes.

340
00:12:53,189 --> 00:12:54,815
It's his radio show again?

341
00:12:54,891 --> 00:12:56,545
I got the goosebumps.

342
00:12:56,559 --> 00:12:58,560
- This is fascinating. - He was on the show with Jong Hyuk.

343
00:12:58,561 --> 00:13:01,090
- That explains. I know you. - Right.

344
00:13:01,097 --> 00:13:02,390
You're a musical actor.

345
00:13:02,398 --> 00:13:03,530
No, no. I'm a theater actor.

346
00:13:03,533 --> 00:13:05,500
(That's incorrect!)

347
00:13:05,501 --> 00:13:06,560
You're a musical actor.

348
00:13:06,569 --> 00:13:08,125
No, no. I'm a theater actor.

349
00:13:08,204 --> 00:13:11,740
(We're looking for his memories which has disappeared.)

350
00:13:11,741 --> 00:13:12,800
- He keeps getting it wrong. - A theater actor.

351
00:13:12,809 --> 00:13:14,970
(He is the victim of Seok Jin's bad memories.)

352
00:13:14,977 --> 00:13:16,610
He's very famous theater actor.

353
00:13:16,612 --> 00:13:17,980
He keeps getting it wrong.

354
00:13:17,980 --> 00:13:20,380
- He keeps forgetting. - This never ends.

355
00:13:20,383 --> 00:13:22,480
- You gave me your number too. - He gave you his number?

356
00:13:22,485 --> 00:13:25,350
- Really? - You said I should call you up.

357
00:13:25,354 --> 00:13:27,190
- I... - I called you after we finished.

358
00:13:27,190 --> 00:13:30,220
I only give out my number to people I really like.

359
00:13:30,226 --> 00:13:31,360
I gave it out only to a handful of people.

360
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:33,060
That doesn't matter. He doesn't remember.

361
00:13:33,062 --> 00:13:35,130
- Are you from Jeongseon? - Yes.

362
00:13:35,131 --> 00:13:36,990
- My goodness. - He's also from Jeongseon.

363
00:13:36,999 --> 00:13:38,400
(Nice to meet you, my fellow hometown friend.)

364
00:13:38,401 --> 00:13:40,400
That must have been why he gave you his number.

365
00:13:40,403 --> 00:13:41,730
You're also from Jeongseon.

366
00:13:41,737 --> 00:13:43,000
You talked about it on the radio show.

367
00:13:43,005 --> 00:13:45,600
(He stubbornly exposes Seok Jin for the 2nd time.)

368
00:13:45,608 --> 00:13:47,740
(Everything that happened today had happened that day.)

369
00:13:47,743 --> 00:13:48,810
We already talked about it.

370
00:13:48,811 --> 00:13:50,910
- You were born in Yeongwol, right? - This is unbelievable.

371
00:13:50,913 --> 00:13:52,110
You were born in Yeongwol.

372
00:13:52,114 --> 00:13:53,640
After listening to everything,

373
00:13:53,649 --> 00:13:55,810
I can tell why he got Seok Jin's number.

374
00:13:55,818 --> 00:13:57,850
- They were from the same place. - Right.

375
00:13:57,854 --> 00:13:59,180
It was because he was from Jeongseon.

376
00:13:59,188 --> 00:14:01,490
- But he thought... - We talked about it on the show.

377
00:14:01,490 --> 00:14:03,545
- he had never seen Hoon before. - He didn't recognize Hoon.

378
00:14:03,559 --> 00:14:06,460
He kept saying how he had kinds eyes.

379
00:14:06,462 --> 00:14:10,030
He said that Hoon had kind eyes. This is unbelievable.

380
00:14:10,032 --> 00:14:13,455
It was my first time meeting such a big celebrity like him.

381
00:14:13,703 --> 00:14:15,900
- What's going on lately? - He's another Seok Jin's fan.

382
00:14:15,905 --> 00:14:17,270
- Listen. - Remember Dong Hwi?

383
00:14:17,273 --> 00:14:19,440
- He was my fan too. - Seok Jin has a lot of male fans...

384
00:14:19,442 --> 00:14:22,405
- from the entertainment industry. - He's a celebrity of celebrities.

385
00:14:22,645 --> 00:14:24,740
- We've met too, Jae Seok. - Hey.

386
00:14:24,747 --> 00:14:26,180
(Another scandalous remark)

387
00:14:26,182 --> 00:14:27,180
(This newbie keeps on exposing people.)

388
00:14:27,183 --> 00:14:28,410
He even met Jae Seok?

389
00:14:28,417 --> 00:14:30,110
- No one remembers him. - My goodness.

390
00:14:30,119 --> 00:14:31,680
I usually remember people.

391
00:14:31,687 --> 00:14:33,250
- Jae Seok and I... - When did we meet?

392
00:14:33,256 --> 00:14:36,690
It was when Jung Jun Ha was on a musical.

393
00:14:36,692 --> 00:14:38,490
I was in the musical with him.

394
00:14:38,494 --> 00:14:40,830
- I see. You were in the play. - Yes.

395
00:14:40,830 --> 00:14:42,530
You were in the play.

396
00:14:42,531 --> 00:14:44,060
After meeting him that day,

397
00:14:44,066 --> 00:14:46,460
- he left a strong impression on me. - Why?

398
00:14:46,469 --> 00:14:47,630
- Why? - Did he do something good again?

399
00:14:47,637 --> 00:14:51,200
- A lot of people came for Jun Ha. - That's right.

400
00:14:51,207 --> 00:14:53,940
We were all nervous because we heard that he was here.

401
00:14:53,943 --> 00:14:55,310
We were waiting for Jae Seok,

402
00:14:55,311 --> 00:14:56,510
but he didn't come.

403
00:14:56,512 --> 00:14:57,580
We were wondering what was taking him long.

404
00:14:57,580 --> 00:14:59,210
When I went out of the room,

405
00:14:59,215 --> 00:15:02,605
he was saying hello to every single staff member.

406
00:15:03,386 --> 00:15:06,050
He went all the way to the back and said he enjoyed the show.

407
00:15:06,055 --> 00:15:08,250
He's being nosy. What would he do that?

408
00:15:08,257 --> 00:15:10,820
Why would he say hello to the staff of someone else's show?

409
00:15:10,826 --> 00:15:11,860
That's being nosy.

410
00:15:11,861 --> 00:15:14,890
Why would he say hi to the staff of a show he wasn't on?

411
00:15:14,897 --> 00:15:16,530
You should have met up with the actors.

412
00:15:16,532 --> 00:15:17,730
Goodness.

413
00:15:17,733 --> 00:15:19,260
- I can't understand him. - He's nervous about...

414
00:15:19,268 --> 00:15:20,600
- good stories about Jae Seok. - Goodness, Hoon.

415
00:15:20,603 --> 00:15:22,500
You were in the show with Jun Ha.

416
00:15:22,505 --> 00:15:23,600
I remember that now.

417
00:15:23,606 --> 00:15:25,900
Great. We finished interviewing Hoon now.

418
00:15:25,908 --> 00:15:27,270
- Hoon. - Yes?

419
00:15:27,276 --> 00:15:29,070
Since you were in a musical, could you sing us a song?

420
00:15:29,078 --> 00:15:30,170
- From the musical? - Yes.

421
00:15:30,179 --> 00:15:33,580
Assessing from the aura he's exuding,

422
00:15:33,582 --> 00:15:35,875
- I think he has a powerful voice. - I agree.

423
00:15:36,152 --> 00:15:38,415
Please sing us a snippet.

424
00:15:38,654 --> 00:15:43,520
(How will his 1st song on his 1st variety show sound?)

425
00:15:43,526 --> 00:15:46,655
(Clearing his throat)

426
00:15:46,829 --> 00:15:49,485
Thank you

427
00:15:49,665 --> 00:15:51,325
Father

428
00:15:51,400 --> 00:15:53,225
I'm sorry.

429
00:15:53,636 --> 00:15:55,000
Father

430
00:15:55,004 --> 00:15:57,670
(Shouting out for the priest in the middle of a variety show)

431
00:15:57,673 --> 00:15:59,470
- I'm sorry. - He's asking for the priest.

432
00:15:59,475 --> 00:16:01,670
- That was too religious, right? - That was religious.

433
00:16:01,677 --> 00:16:03,305
What was that? Was that a hymn?

434
00:16:03,479 --> 00:16:05,180
- I got shy when I was singing it. - A hymn?

435
00:16:05,181 --> 00:16:07,280
- Was that a hymn? - Which song is that?

436
00:16:07,283 --> 00:16:09,150
- I'm sorry. When I was singing it, - Excuse me.

437
00:16:09,151 --> 00:16:11,380
- it was too religious. I shouldn't. - He asked for the priest.

438
00:16:11,387 --> 00:16:13,020
- My goodness. - I'll sing a different song.

439
00:16:13,022 --> 00:16:14,750
When I was singing the song,

440
00:16:14,757 --> 00:16:17,120
- the song didn't suit the location. - You can sing religious songs.

441
00:16:17,126 --> 00:16:19,120
- Father as for the priest? - Yes, exactly.

442
00:16:19,128 --> 00:16:20,490
- When I was singing it, - Could you...

443
00:16:20,496 --> 00:16:22,460
- I startled myself. - sing a song we know?

444
00:16:22,465 --> 00:16:23,830
I shouldn't have sung this song.

445
00:16:23,833 --> 00:16:25,060
- Let's try again. - Okay.

446
00:16:25,067 --> 00:16:26,755
(He tries to sing again.)

447
00:16:27,169 --> 00:16:29,800
(From the musical, "All the Brothers were Valiant")

448
00:16:29,805 --> 00:16:31,070
("Crying")

449
00:16:31,073 --> 00:16:32,200
He's good.

450
00:16:32,208 --> 00:16:34,735
(They're impressed.)

451
00:16:35,378 --> 00:16:36,410
I'll stop here.

452
00:16:36,412 --> 00:16:38,310
(He sings a short and powerful snippet.)

453
00:16:38,314 --> 00:16:39,840
- I can't sing it anymore. - He's very good.

454
00:16:39,849 --> 00:16:41,610
This is how people usually sing when we ask.

455
00:16:41,617 --> 00:16:42,850
They sing a short snippet.

456
00:16:42,852 --> 00:16:45,945
No one sings the whole verse like he did.

457
00:16:46,222 --> 00:16:48,145
I've never heard of a song without a pause.

458
00:16:49,458 --> 00:16:52,055
Please give a round of applause to these four guests.

459
00:16:53,162 --> 00:16:54,785
That was great.

460
00:16:54,930 --> 00:16:57,430
- I can't wait for their drama. - They're fun.

461
00:16:57,433 --> 00:16:58,860
Today,

462
00:16:58,868 --> 00:17:00,360
- it's the Lunar New Year Special. - Okay.

463
00:17:00,369 --> 00:17:02,300
You can only win when you find the true king...

464
00:17:02,304 --> 00:17:04,170
and when the king sits on the throne.

465
00:17:04,173 --> 00:17:07,740
The race is called Will You Be the King or Nobody?

466
00:17:07,743 --> 00:17:09,370
(Will You Be the King or Nobody?)

467
00:17:09,378 --> 00:17:12,110
The candidates who can be the king are...

468
00:17:12,114 --> 00:17:16,145
Seok Jin, So Min, and Il Woo because last names all start with J.

469
00:17:17,853 --> 00:17:19,120
Hello.

470
00:17:19,121 --> 00:17:20,480
(Preliminary meeting before filming)

471
00:17:20,489 --> 00:17:22,250
All three of you...

472
00:17:22,258 --> 00:17:25,120
are candidates to become the king as your last names start with J.

473
00:17:25,127 --> 00:17:27,860
One of you is the real king.

474
00:17:27,863 --> 00:17:30,190
And the two of you are only pretenders.

475
00:17:30,199 --> 00:17:33,830
We'll choose the real king by a random draw.

476
00:17:33,836 --> 00:17:36,130
You will choose 1 of the 3 royal seals.

477
00:17:36,138 --> 00:17:37,600
You will stamp the seal,

478
00:17:37,606 --> 00:17:39,695
and if it says, "king", you will be the king.

479
00:17:39,842 --> 00:17:41,970
If it says, "nobody", then you will be pretenders.

480
00:17:41,977 --> 00:17:44,135
(Pretenders)

481
00:17:44,246 --> 00:17:47,750
(They start the draw to select the king.)

482
00:17:47,750 --> 00:17:50,480
Wouldn't the older-looking one be the real one?

483
00:17:50,486 --> 00:17:52,215
I will go with this one.

484
00:17:52,254 --> 00:17:53,750
(The identity of the king has been chosen randomly.)

485
00:17:53,756 --> 00:17:55,885
Please! Please.

486
00:17:55,925 --> 00:17:57,585
Let me be the king.

487
00:17:57,626 --> 00:18:01,130
(Which one of them will be the real king?)

488
00:18:01,130 --> 00:18:04,530
Today's race is a team match, and the three of you will...

489
00:18:04,533 --> 00:18:06,125
form your own teams.

490
00:18:06,402 --> 00:18:10,330
The king with the most number of civilians will take the throne.

491
00:18:10,339 --> 00:18:12,500
And if the real king takes the throne,

492
00:18:12,508 --> 00:18:14,110
the king's team will win the race.

493
00:18:14,110 --> 00:18:16,310
The king and the civilians will win a prize.

494
00:18:16,312 --> 00:18:19,140
If the pretender takes the throne, it will be the pretender's victory.

495
00:18:19,148 --> 00:18:22,045
The rest of you will face the penalty.

496
00:18:22,384 --> 00:18:25,680
Before we begin today's race, you will divide into teams.

497
00:18:25,688 --> 00:18:27,150
The maximum number of people...

498
00:18:27,156 --> 00:18:29,385
in each team is four including the king.

499
00:18:29,792 --> 00:18:32,690
You can choose the king you want to follow.

500
00:18:32,695 --> 00:18:33,920
We'll be choosing the team.

501
00:18:33,929 --> 00:18:35,430
I like that we get to choose our team.

502
00:18:35,431 --> 00:18:37,630
Everyone, line up.

503
00:18:37,633 --> 00:18:39,100
You have to pick the right line.

504
00:18:39,101 --> 00:18:40,995
Seok Jin, definitely.

505
00:18:41,237 --> 00:18:42,630
Welcome, Haha.

506
00:18:42,638 --> 00:18:44,340
Why is it only girls behind Il Woo?

507
00:18:44,340 --> 00:18:45,340
Why did so many choose Seok Jin?

508
00:18:45,341 --> 00:18:46,470
This is not a popularity contest.

509
00:18:46,475 --> 00:18:47,740
There was no one here.

510
00:18:47,743 --> 00:18:49,670
- There was no one. - This is not a popularity contest.

511
00:18:49,678 --> 00:18:51,810
Is this a popularity contest?

512
00:18:51,814 --> 00:18:53,740
So Min, you're a king. Come here.

513
00:18:53,749 --> 00:18:58,550
(I want to be Il Woo's civilian.)

514
00:18:58,554 --> 00:19:00,780
- You're a king. - I don't want to be.

515
00:19:00,789 --> 00:19:02,645
I don't want to be a king.

516
00:19:02,825 --> 00:19:05,660
Look at that. Do you know why they all chose Seok Jin?

517
00:19:05,661 --> 00:19:07,560
It's because he looks easy.

518
00:19:07,563 --> 00:19:09,030
There will be a coup.

519
00:19:09,031 --> 00:19:11,460
The king looks so easy.

520
00:19:11,467 --> 00:19:14,030
- That's why... - It's affecting me.

521
00:19:14,036 --> 00:19:15,830
It's bothering me.

522
00:19:15,838 --> 00:19:20,070
To help the kings to decide, this is who has the face...

523
00:19:20,075 --> 00:19:21,370
of a traitor.

524
00:19:21,377 --> 00:19:22,770
"The face of a traitor"?

525
00:19:22,778 --> 00:19:24,580
- I know already. - Okay.

526
00:19:24,580 --> 00:19:26,840
But we already know.

527
00:19:26,849 --> 00:19:28,250
- Kwang Soo. - We already know.

528
00:19:28,250 --> 00:19:30,680
No. There is nothing wrong with my face.

529
00:19:30,686 --> 00:19:32,580
- Who is it? - It's the most likely one.

530
00:19:32,588 --> 00:19:33,750
Isn't it Kwang Soo?

531
00:19:33,756 --> 00:19:36,145
- I don't look like a traitor. - It must be Kwang Soo.

532
00:19:36,425 --> 00:19:38,885
The person who has the face of a traitor.

533
00:19:39,261 --> 00:19:40,390
Kim Jong Kook.

534
00:19:40,396 --> 00:19:43,630
(Kim Jong Kook)

535
00:19:43,632 --> 00:19:44,960
- Jong Kook! - It gave me goosebumps.

536
00:19:44,967 --> 00:19:49,895
(The result surprises everyone.)

537
00:19:50,005 --> 00:19:52,565
- Me? - Unbelievable.

538
00:19:52,575 --> 00:19:54,100
- It gave me goosebumps. - Me?

539
00:19:54,109 --> 00:19:56,510
"His high cheekbones and strong jaw indicate..."

540
00:19:56,512 --> 00:19:59,680
"that he cannot stand dirty work."

541
00:19:59,682 --> 00:20:00,810
(Jong Kook's face analysis)

542
00:20:00,816 --> 00:20:02,850
"He is highly likely to stage a coup."

543
00:20:02,851 --> 00:20:04,850
- Oh, my. - "The more you try to oppress him,"

544
00:20:04,853 --> 00:20:07,650
"the more determined he will be..."

545
00:20:07,656 --> 00:20:09,190
- That's right. - "to overcome it."

546
00:20:09,191 --> 00:20:10,550
- That's right. - He rebels.

547
00:20:10,559 --> 00:20:11,790
Kim Jong Kook, how impertinent of you.

548
00:20:11,794 --> 00:20:13,515
Go away!

549
00:20:13,729 --> 00:20:14,830
Go away!

550
00:20:14,830 --> 00:20:16,790
- Me? - He has the face of a traitor.

551
00:20:16,799 --> 00:20:17,800
(Seok Jin decides to kick Jong Kook out.)

552
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:19,560
I have to get rid of him in the beginning.

553
00:20:19,568 --> 00:20:22,070
He doesn't sound like a king at all.

554
00:20:22,071 --> 00:20:23,530
Go away right now!

555
00:20:23,539 --> 00:20:24,800
"Me?"

556
00:20:24,807 --> 00:20:27,040
How dare you speak to the king that way?

557
00:20:27,042 --> 00:20:29,010
You're not my king.

558
00:20:29,011 --> 00:20:32,680
(He speaks his mind.)

559
00:20:32,681 --> 00:20:34,780
- You're not even my king. - It's a coup.

560
00:20:34,783 --> 00:20:36,010
You're others' king.

561
00:20:36,018 --> 00:20:37,410
- I don't care about you. - "Others' king".

562
00:20:37,419 --> 00:20:40,050
- That king is over now. - He is over.

563
00:20:40,055 --> 00:20:42,315
His whole country is over.

564
00:20:43,359 --> 00:20:44,890
What's that?

565
00:20:44,893 --> 00:20:46,320
(What is the first step to finding the real king?)

566
00:20:46,328 --> 00:20:48,785
What's that? It's my face.

567
00:20:49,064 --> 00:20:52,530
The first step towards finding the real king,

568
00:20:52,534 --> 00:20:54,825
King Son Byung Ho.

569
00:20:56,138 --> 00:20:58,640
- What's that? - "Fold a finger."

570
00:20:58,641 --> 00:21:00,000
(It's a game of folding fingers.)

571
00:21:00,009 --> 00:21:01,810
The three teams and the staff...

572
00:21:01,810 --> 00:21:04,070
will take turns in asking questions.

573
00:21:04,079 --> 00:21:08,110
If any member's answer is "yes",

574
00:21:08,117 --> 00:21:10,210
the team has to put down the picture of the king.

575
00:21:10,219 --> 00:21:11,580
The winning team will receive...

576
00:21:11,587 --> 00:21:15,185
a hint, a treason right, and a recruitment right.

577
00:21:15,524 --> 00:21:17,415
All three?

578
00:21:17,793 --> 00:21:18,860
That's generous.

579
00:21:18,861 --> 00:21:20,220
We need more people, right?

580
00:21:20,229 --> 00:21:22,590
- That's how we win. - We need to recruit more people.

581
00:21:22,598 --> 00:21:23,930
We should ask a question first.

582
00:21:23,932 --> 00:21:25,800
- That'd be better. - We should go first.

583
00:21:25,801 --> 00:21:28,670
- Can we recruit a king too? - No.

584
00:21:28,671 --> 00:21:31,100
(The civilian doesn't understand the rules yet.)

585
00:21:31,106 --> 00:21:32,140
Don't say that.

586
00:21:32,141 --> 00:21:34,295
- Can you go wash your face? - I'm your only king.

587
00:21:34,510 --> 00:21:35,770
- Do you want to go wash your face? - I'm your king.

588
00:21:35,778 --> 00:21:37,470
Go wash your face.

589
00:21:37,479 --> 00:21:38,880
He seems to want to leave.

590
00:21:38,881 --> 00:21:40,510
You can leave if you want.

591
00:21:40,516 --> 00:21:41,550
Go ahead.

592
00:21:41,550 --> 00:21:42,650
(Seok Jin's team will go first.)

593
00:21:42,651 --> 00:21:43,850
- That one? - Yes.

594
00:21:43,852 --> 00:21:45,520
Is that one good? Are you sure?

595
00:21:45,521 --> 00:21:47,120
Of course.

596
00:21:47,122 --> 00:21:49,450
(What is Seok Jin's team's first question?)

597
00:21:49,458 --> 00:21:51,020
- It will kill everyone. - Okay.

598
00:21:51,026 --> 00:21:52,060
- Then... - Okay.

599
00:21:52,061 --> 00:21:54,290
- Let's go with that one. - Let's do that.

600
00:21:54,296 --> 00:21:56,930
"While shooting a drama or something,"

601
00:21:56,932 --> 00:21:58,260
"my heart has never fluttered..."

602
00:21:58,267 --> 00:22:02,070
"because of a colleague."

603
00:22:02,071 --> 00:22:04,740
Even if you don't like that person, your heart can flutter.

604
00:22:04,740 --> 00:22:06,440
If your heart has ever fluttered... It's happened to me.

605
00:22:06,442 --> 00:22:08,905
My heart flutters every day.

606
00:22:08,911 --> 00:22:10,310
(Yul's heart flutters every day.)

607
00:22:10,312 --> 00:22:12,740
Yul's heart flutters every day.

608
00:22:12,748 --> 00:22:13,940
It's happened to me.

609
00:22:13,949 --> 00:22:15,680
- I think this one will just pass. - Don't fold your finger.

610
00:22:15,684 --> 00:22:16,780
No one will fold their fingers.

611
00:22:16,785 --> 00:22:20,520
If your heart has never fluttered, fold your finger.

612
00:22:20,522 --> 00:22:22,750
1, 2, 3.

613
00:22:22,758 --> 00:22:24,290
(Will any of the pictures be put down?)

614
00:22:24,293 --> 00:22:27,115
No one has folded their fingers? It's happened to everyone?

615
00:22:27,262 --> 00:22:29,360
Everyone? It's happened to everyone.

616
00:22:29,365 --> 00:22:31,030
My heart fluttered because of my wife.

617
00:22:31,033 --> 00:22:34,730
I met my wife during a show.

618
00:22:34,737 --> 00:22:36,925
You performed together?

619
00:22:36,972 --> 00:22:38,770
For the first time...

620
00:22:38,774 --> 00:22:40,670
- Your heart fluttered? - You felt something.

621
00:22:40,676 --> 00:22:44,335
I thought, "Is this not just a show?"

622
00:22:45,047 --> 00:22:48,480
(They met as an actor and an actress.)

623
00:22:48,484 --> 00:22:51,720
(Park Hoon and Park Min Jung share their lives now.)

624
00:22:51,720 --> 00:22:53,180
She is very beautiful.

625
00:22:53,188 --> 00:22:55,190
- She is? - She is really beautiful.

626
00:22:55,190 --> 00:22:57,520
I'm jealous.

627
00:22:57,526 --> 00:22:58,690
(That's when my heart fluttered the most.)

628
00:22:58,694 --> 00:23:00,420
That's amazing.

629
00:23:00,429 --> 00:23:02,285
For you, it was your wife.

630
00:23:02,564 --> 00:23:05,430
For Seok Jin, it was Yang Jung A.

631
00:23:05,434 --> 00:23:07,660
You told me your heart fluttered.

632
00:23:07,669 --> 00:23:09,300
Why...

633
00:23:09,304 --> 00:23:11,565
(Seok Jin's heart fluttered because of Jung A?)

634
00:23:12,508 --> 00:23:13,870
Why...

635
00:23:13,876 --> 00:23:15,710
(What are you talking about?)

636
00:23:15,711 --> 00:23:17,170
It's not like that.

637
00:23:17,179 --> 00:23:19,980
Since then, you've been talking about "Flaming Youth".

638
00:23:19,982 --> 00:23:21,150
(Haha is setting Seok Jin up.)

639
00:23:21,150 --> 00:23:22,150
(Seok Jin will not be able to go home tonight.)

640
00:23:22,151 --> 00:23:24,080
It's not like that. When my wife appeared on this show,

641
00:23:24,086 --> 00:23:26,850
she was wearing bridal makeup.

642
00:23:26,855 --> 00:23:28,320
(She made my heart flutter.)

643
00:23:28,323 --> 00:23:29,390
It's Seok Jin's wife.

644
00:23:29,391 --> 00:23:31,460
- Really? - Hi.

645
00:23:31,460 --> 00:23:34,020
- She is beautiful. - She is gorgeous.

646
00:23:34,029 --> 00:23:37,060
My heart skipped a beat. I was so excited.

647
00:23:37,065 --> 00:23:38,130
You're lying.

648
00:23:38,133 --> 00:23:39,860
(You're lying!)

649
00:23:39,868 --> 00:23:42,630
- After the shooting, - Your attack was so clumsy.

650
00:23:42,638 --> 00:23:46,135
he said his wife made him so uncomfortable.

651
00:23:46,508 --> 00:23:49,410
I had no idea she was coming.

652
00:23:49,411 --> 00:23:52,335
Suddenly...

653
00:23:52,414 --> 00:23:54,280
Yul, what about you?

654
00:23:54,283 --> 00:23:56,780
I shot "Let's Eat"...

655
00:23:56,785 --> 00:23:58,080
with Seo Hyun Jin.

656
00:23:58,086 --> 00:23:59,680
(The lovely actress, Seo Hyun Jin, made my heart flutter.)

657
00:23:59,688 --> 00:24:00,680
I love her.

658
00:24:00,689 --> 00:24:02,050
She made the viewers' hearts flutter too.

659
00:24:02,057 --> 00:24:03,720
- We agree. - Everyone's heart fluttered.

660
00:24:03,725 --> 00:24:05,320
She drives everyone crazy.

661
00:24:05,327 --> 00:24:06,560
Right. She's so attractive.

662
00:24:06,562 --> 00:24:09,460
Her charms make everyone's heart flutter.

663
00:24:09,465 --> 00:24:11,230
So Min, what about you?

664
00:24:11,233 --> 00:24:13,530
Well, most recently,

665
00:24:13,535 --> 00:24:15,730
Kim Ji Suk made my heart flutter.

666
00:24:15,737 --> 00:24:17,500
Doesn't Lee Sang Yeob appear too?

667
00:24:17,506 --> 00:24:19,270
He didn't make your heart flutter?

668
00:24:19,274 --> 00:24:20,470
He and I are a family.

669
00:24:20,476 --> 00:24:22,140
(Sang Yeob and I are a family.)

670
00:24:22,144 --> 00:24:24,270
In addition to Ji Suk, Gong Myoung as well.

671
00:24:24,279 --> 00:24:26,835
- Myoung. - Gong Myoung.

672
00:24:27,816 --> 00:24:31,850
(So Min approached Gong Myoung with her acrostic poem.)

673
00:24:31,854 --> 00:24:35,220
(His puppy-like charm stole So Min's heart.)

674
00:24:35,224 --> 00:24:37,090
- Gong Myoung... - When he appeared,

675
00:24:37,092 --> 00:24:40,285
- she was completely... - She kept talking about him.

676
00:24:40,996 --> 00:24:44,560
(Myoung, how are you doing?)

677
00:24:44,566 --> 00:24:46,495
She's shy.

678
00:24:46,635 --> 00:24:48,200
Ji Suk or Gong Myoung?

679
00:24:48,203 --> 00:24:49,370
(Choose one.)

680
00:24:49,371 --> 00:24:52,000
Well, Ji Suk or Gong Myoung?

681
00:24:52,007 --> 00:24:53,170
1, 2...

682
00:24:53,175 --> 00:24:55,770
They're completely different. Myoung is like a puppy,

683
00:24:55,777 --> 00:24:58,735
and Ji Suk is sexy.

684
00:24:58,747 --> 00:25:00,575
Ji Suk or Gong Myoung?

685
00:25:00,649 --> 00:25:06,320
(Everyone is with her in this important choice.)

686
00:25:06,321 --> 00:25:07,945
When will this air?

687
00:25:08,490 --> 00:25:09,920
February 3.

688
00:25:09,925 --> 00:25:11,220
Gong Myoung.

689
00:25:11,226 --> 00:25:13,190
(Then I choose Gong Myoung.)

690
00:25:13,195 --> 00:25:15,890
(Our drama will be over by then.)

691
00:25:15,898 --> 00:25:17,955
Your drama will be over, right?

692
00:25:18,233 --> 00:25:20,695
(That's a reasonable choice.)

693
00:25:21,236 --> 00:25:23,670
- Gong Myoung. - Suddenly...

694
00:25:23,672 --> 00:25:24,770
What about you?

695
00:25:24,773 --> 00:25:26,770
- For me... - You didn't fold your finger.

696
00:25:26,775 --> 00:25:28,370
Na Kyung Eun, of course.

697
00:25:28,377 --> 00:25:31,610
(Manly)

698
00:25:31,613 --> 00:25:33,210
How did it happen?

699
00:25:33,215 --> 00:25:34,550
No one knew about it.

700
00:25:34,550 --> 00:25:37,050
- We called her Ma Bong Chun. - We did.

701
00:25:37,052 --> 00:25:38,480
You didn't know it was Kyung Eun?

702
00:25:38,487 --> 00:25:40,620
- No. - We didn't.

703
00:25:40,622 --> 00:25:42,645
How did you find out alone?

704
00:25:42,758 --> 00:25:44,345
Because I loved her.

705
00:25:45,127 --> 00:25:47,560
(Passionate Romance Warning)

706
00:25:47,563 --> 00:25:49,360
- That's so cool. - "Because I loved her."

707
00:25:49,364 --> 00:25:50,690
- That's so cool. - How manly.

708
00:25:50,699 --> 00:25:52,200
(It makes everyone's heart flutter.)

709
00:25:52,200 --> 00:25:53,660
"Because I loved her."

710
00:25:53,669 --> 00:25:54,970
(It makes everyone's heart flutter.)

711
00:25:54,970 --> 00:25:56,570
- "Because I loved her." - Because I loved her.

712
00:25:56,572 --> 00:25:58,770
He's so manly.

713
00:25:58,774 --> 00:25:59,770
Because I loved her.

714
00:25:59,775 --> 00:26:01,470
What about you, Il Woo?

715
00:26:01,476 --> 00:26:04,265
For me, it was A Ra.

716
00:26:04,379 --> 00:26:06,305
I knew it.

717
00:26:06,315 --> 00:26:08,180
(The interrogation begins.)

718
00:26:08,183 --> 00:26:09,250
When did it start?

719
00:26:09,251 --> 00:26:11,505
When we started shooting this drama.

720
00:26:11,820 --> 00:26:13,780
Before, she was just a friend,

721
00:26:13,789 --> 00:26:15,790
but she is a girl now?

722
00:26:15,791 --> 00:26:19,055
If you didn't mean it that way, you have to fold your finger.

723
00:26:19,161 --> 00:26:21,790
(A friend? A girl?)

724
00:26:21,797 --> 00:26:24,630
Are there different ways?

725
00:26:24,633 --> 00:26:28,200
(He wants to protect his king.)

726
00:26:28,203 --> 00:26:29,630
Why are you picking a fight?

727
00:26:29,638 --> 00:26:31,400
We're both civilians.

728
00:26:31,406 --> 00:26:33,740
If he meant it that way, they'd be married by now.

729
00:26:33,742 --> 00:26:36,005
You're helping him?

730
00:26:36,278 --> 00:26:37,740
(Ji Hyo is suspected to trying to help Jong Kook.)

731
00:26:37,746 --> 00:26:40,005
She's helping him.

732
00:26:40,382 --> 00:26:41,910
She brought up marriage.

733
00:26:41,917 --> 00:26:43,150
(You want it to show?)

734
00:26:43,151 --> 00:26:44,380
I mean...

735
00:26:44,386 --> 00:26:46,280
We're a team.

736
00:26:46,288 --> 00:26:50,020
- I mean, your heart flutters... - You two... All right.

737
00:26:50,025 --> 00:26:51,760
- Ji Hyo. - I'm curious.

738
00:26:51,760 --> 00:26:52,820
Doesn't your heart flutter these days?

739
00:26:52,828 --> 00:26:55,460
Be honest. You didn't fold your finger.

740
00:26:55,464 --> 00:26:58,260
Ji Hyo's heart must have fluttered many times.

741
00:26:58,266 --> 00:27:00,655
Did your heart flutter more when Gary was here?

742
00:27:01,903 --> 00:27:04,725
- That... - Who is Gary?

743
00:27:06,041 --> 00:27:09,070
(She has moved on completely.)

744
00:27:09,077 --> 00:27:12,610
(Their supporters are excited.)

745
00:27:12,614 --> 00:27:14,540
- Okay. - Hold your hands!

746
00:27:14,549 --> 00:27:16,150
Gary has left.

747
00:27:16,151 --> 00:27:18,380
Why would I have feelings left for him?

748
00:27:18,387 --> 00:27:22,190
- Hold your hands! - Hold your hands!

749
00:27:22,190 --> 00:27:23,790
- Okay, good. - A girl's heart...

750
00:27:23,792 --> 00:27:25,120
Okay, good.

751
00:27:25,127 --> 00:27:27,190
So everyone proved it.

752
00:27:27,195 --> 00:27:28,330
Everyone proved it.

753
00:27:28,330 --> 00:27:30,090
- Is it our turn now? - Yes.

754
00:27:30,098 --> 00:27:31,825
We should...

755
00:27:32,067 --> 00:27:35,825
What kind of question will we be able to escape from?

756
00:27:36,138 --> 00:27:37,300
(What will So Min's team ask?)

757
00:27:37,305 --> 00:27:38,570
- We're ready. - We're confident.

758
00:27:38,573 --> 00:27:39,700
It'll definitely work.

759
00:27:39,708 --> 00:27:41,765
- Here we go. - Okay.

760
00:27:42,044 --> 00:27:43,840
If you have a girlfriend, fold your finger.

761
00:27:43,845 --> 00:27:45,240
(If you have a girlfriend, fold your finger.)

762
00:27:45,247 --> 00:27:47,380
(Girlfriend?)

763
00:27:47,382 --> 00:27:48,750
"If you have a girlfriend"?

764
00:27:48,750 --> 00:27:50,210
- What about a wife? - It doesn't count.

765
00:27:50,218 --> 00:27:53,250
- Not if you're married. - "If you have a girlfriend"?

766
00:27:53,255 --> 00:27:55,945
Call her and break up with her.

767
00:27:56,024 --> 00:27:57,150
Right now.

768
00:27:57,159 --> 00:27:58,420
(That doesn't count.)

769
00:27:58,427 --> 00:28:00,555
Call her and break up with her.

770
00:28:00,662 --> 00:28:02,930
You can meet her after this.

771
00:28:02,931 --> 00:28:03,990
(After thinking for a moment, )

772
00:28:03,999 --> 00:28:05,960
(he put down the picture.)

773
00:28:05,967 --> 00:28:07,830
He's so cool.

774
00:28:07,836 --> 00:28:10,100
(The romantic giraffe is back.)

775
00:28:10,105 --> 00:28:11,570
- He's a man. - He's a man.

776
00:28:11,573 --> 00:28:13,040
He's so cool.

777
00:28:13,041 --> 00:28:15,140
I couldn't escape.

778
00:28:15,143 --> 00:28:17,210
It was a trap.

779
00:28:17,212 --> 00:28:18,440
- Okay. - Okay.

780
00:28:18,447 --> 00:28:20,940
- They were going for us. - We did a good job.

781
00:28:20,949 --> 00:28:24,010
We're done. Let's move on.

782
00:28:24,019 --> 00:28:25,750
- Ask that one. - I will.

783
00:28:25,754 --> 00:28:26,950
Relax.

784
00:28:26,955 --> 00:28:28,445
(We already have a question ready.)

785
00:28:28,657 --> 00:28:29,990
If you're married, for your finger.

786
00:28:29,991 --> 00:28:33,520
(If you're married, for your finger.)

787
00:28:33,528 --> 00:28:34,560
This is not okay.

788
00:28:34,563 --> 00:28:36,730
Why is it different from the previous one?

789
00:28:36,732 --> 00:28:38,485
Okay. Put it down.

790
00:28:38,767 --> 00:28:40,200
I'm sorry. I'm married.

791
00:28:40,202 --> 00:28:41,870
- It's a good thing. - Okay.

792
00:28:41,870 --> 00:28:43,270
It's a good thing that you're married.

793
00:28:43,271 --> 00:28:45,940
I'm married. Put it down.

794
00:28:45,941 --> 00:28:47,040
(So Min and Seok Jin's teams have put down 1 each.)

795
00:28:47,042 --> 00:28:48,310
- This is annoying. - They have only one left.

796
00:28:48,310 --> 00:28:50,205
They picked the right target.

797
00:28:50,278 --> 00:28:52,880
If they put down one more,

798
00:28:52,881 --> 00:28:54,810
- they'll be out, right? - Yes.

799
00:28:54,816 --> 00:28:57,205
- It's the staff's turn now. - The staff's turn.

800
00:28:57,686 --> 00:28:59,380
Sing into the karaoke machine.

801
00:28:59,387 --> 00:29:00,820
All teams except the winning team will put down one.

802
00:29:00,822 --> 00:29:02,490
(All teams except the winning team will put down one.)

803
00:29:02,491 --> 00:29:05,020
- Guys, we have Yul. - Me?

804
00:29:05,026 --> 00:29:07,860
We have Yul.

805
00:29:07,863 --> 00:29:09,660
- Yul. - We have Hoon.

806
00:29:09,664 --> 00:29:10,960
- Right. - Seriously.

807
00:29:10,966 --> 00:29:12,900
Park Hoon. We have him.

808
00:29:12,901 --> 00:29:14,330
I got a high score in a karaoke bar recently.

809
00:29:14,336 --> 00:29:16,830
We have Jong Kook.

810
00:29:16,838 --> 00:29:19,300
Okay. Let's do this!

811
00:29:19,307 --> 00:29:21,100
- If you sing a dance song, - Let's do this.

812
00:29:21,109 --> 00:29:22,470
you'll definitely get a high score.

813
00:29:22,477 --> 00:29:24,340
- What should we sing? - Something fun.

814
00:29:24,346 --> 00:29:26,580
- Something fun would be nice. - Let's take off our jackets.

815
00:29:26,581 --> 00:29:29,210
- Turn around one by one. - How do we do it?

816
00:29:29,217 --> 00:29:30,810
- Like this. - How?

817
00:29:30,819 --> 00:29:32,780
(Team King Seok Jin goes first. The intro starts.)

818
00:29:32,788 --> 00:29:34,915
We have to sing something like that too.

819
00:29:35,457 --> 00:29:38,090
(The intro of "To You" by Infinite Track excites everyone.)

820
00:29:38,093 --> 00:29:39,420
Turn around.

821
00:29:39,427 --> 00:29:41,090
(The variety show newbie, Park Hoon)

822
00:29:41,096 --> 00:29:42,830
(Haha with a cold)

823
00:29:42,831 --> 00:29:44,430
(The weak king, Seok Jin)

824
00:29:44,432 --> 00:29:47,060
(The romantic civilian, Kwang Soo)

825
00:29:47,068 --> 00:29:48,100
Oh, my.

826
00:29:48,103 --> 00:29:51,295
(They show off amazing teamwork.)

827
00:29:51,406 --> 00:29:52,940
They picked a good song.

828
00:29:52,941 --> 00:29:54,600
- The color of Yonsei University. - Let's go!

829
00:29:54,609 --> 00:29:56,765
They're wearing the color of Yonsei University.

830
00:29:56,845 --> 00:29:59,810
Please send a lot of love to SBS's "Haechi".

831
00:29:59,815 --> 00:30:01,505
Arms around shoulders.

832
00:30:02,083 --> 00:30:03,080
So Min.

833
00:30:03,084 --> 00:30:04,780
(Perfect teamwork)

834
00:30:04,786 --> 00:30:05,780
Let's go!

835
00:30:05,787 --> 00:30:08,420
(He sings with a holy voice.)

836
00:30:08,423 --> 00:30:12,360
(With stable vocals and systematic moves, they start out nicely.)

837
00:30:12,360 --> 00:30:14,615
(What?)

838
00:30:14,896 --> 00:30:19,895
(They get too excited and forget about competition.)

839
00:30:20,135 --> 00:30:22,800
(Civilian Hoon leads, )

840
00:30:22,804 --> 00:30:24,870
(and the whole kingdom follows.)

841
00:30:24,873 --> 00:30:28,705
- What other songs are there? - What should we sing?

842
00:30:28,944 --> 00:30:30,910
(Even if I lose...)

843
00:30:30,912 --> 00:30:32,010
(everything...)

844
00:30:32,013 --> 00:30:33,710
(I have loved)

845
00:30:33,715 --> 00:30:34,850
Jump!

846
00:30:34,850 --> 00:30:36,250
(While Team King Seok Jin sings, )

847
00:30:36,251 --> 00:30:37,750
(they jump in again.)

848
00:30:37,752 --> 00:30:40,475
(The dancers intrude.)

849
00:30:40,755 --> 00:30:43,050
(Way to go!)

850
00:30:43,058 --> 00:30:45,790
(Explosive high notes)

851
00:30:45,794 --> 00:30:46,920
Together!

852
00:30:46,928 --> 00:30:50,760
(He has a cold.)

853
00:30:50,765 --> 00:30:53,360
They won't get a high score.

854
00:30:53,368 --> 00:30:55,400
(We won't?)

855
00:30:55,403 --> 00:30:57,930
(Then we'll gather around the microphone.)

856
00:30:57,939 --> 00:31:00,700
(We can feel the high score.)

857
00:31:00,709 --> 00:31:03,410
They won't get a high score.

858
00:31:03,411 --> 00:31:04,410
- They won't. - They won't.

859
00:31:04,412 --> 00:31:06,705
- They won't get a high score. - They won't.

860
00:31:06,781 --> 00:31:08,780
(They finished the song with great teamwork.)

861
00:31:08,783 --> 00:31:10,350
One person should have sung. Please.

862
00:31:10,352 --> 00:31:11,620
(What's their score?)

863
00:31:11,620 --> 00:31:17,985
(They only have 1 left. They have to win.)

864
00:31:18,660 --> 00:31:20,390
It's 93. It's high.

865
00:31:20,395 --> 00:31:22,730
(It's not bad.)

866
00:31:22,731 --> 00:31:24,830
- The machine is generous. - It's high.

867
00:31:24,833 --> 00:31:27,400
- It's generous with scores. - Okay.

868
00:31:27,402 --> 00:31:30,000
We have to win. Otherwise, we're out.

869
00:31:30,005 --> 00:31:32,440
- Let's go! Yul, let's go. - Let's go!

870
00:31:32,440 --> 00:31:33,440
Where is it?

871
00:31:33,441 --> 00:31:35,835
- Let's do this! - We danced so hard.

872
00:31:36,144 --> 00:31:37,910
"As I Told You"?

873
00:31:37,913 --> 00:31:38,910
(This song is strong.)

874
00:31:38,914 --> 00:31:41,710
- "As I Told You". - This song...

875
00:31:41,716 --> 00:31:43,880
("As I Told You" by Kim Sung Jae)

876
00:31:43,885 --> 00:31:47,815
(Here come the dancers.)

877
00:31:47,923 --> 00:31:50,215
(The pop dance expert, So Min)

878
00:31:50,358 --> 00:31:52,855
Rotate. Rotate around Yul.

879
00:31:53,295 --> 00:31:55,785
(The whole-verse singer, Yul)

880
00:31:56,164 --> 00:31:57,990
(Nervous)

881
00:31:57,999 --> 00:31:59,100
A Ra, what fun songs are there?

882
00:31:59,100 --> 00:32:01,755
"Wrongful Encounter" or...

883
00:32:01,903 --> 00:32:03,270
(Limp)

884
00:32:03,271 --> 00:32:05,265
(Turning)

885
00:32:06,308 --> 00:32:07,795
What's that?

886
00:32:08,643 --> 00:32:11,935
(It looks weird, but he is a good dancer.)

887
00:32:12,013 --> 00:32:14,840
(It's funny and cool at the same time.)

888
00:32:14,849 --> 00:32:15,880
Good!

889
00:32:15,884 --> 00:32:17,375
(I don't want them to get a high score.)

890
00:32:17,452 --> 00:32:18,920
(It's time to sing!)

891
00:32:18,920 --> 00:32:23,685
(He starts singing at the top of his lungs.)

892
00:32:24,059 --> 00:32:25,990
(This is fun.)

893
00:32:25,994 --> 00:32:28,330
(Korean songs are the best.)

894
00:32:28,330 --> 00:32:30,090
(Another day gone, )

895
00:32:30,098 --> 00:32:32,030
(and I am still...)

896
00:32:32,033 --> 00:32:34,860
(here)

897
00:32:34,869 --> 00:32:37,000
(Excited)

898
00:32:37,005 --> 00:32:39,200
(All the civilians team up.)

899
00:32:39,207 --> 00:32:43,235
(They make even their opponents have fun.)

900
00:32:43,311 --> 00:32:46,575
(His steps are fancier than his singing skills.)

901
00:32:47,148 --> 00:32:49,210
It's so flashy.

902
00:32:49,217 --> 00:32:50,250
His steps...

903
00:32:50,251 --> 00:32:52,480
(So Min's signature moves)

904
00:32:52,487 --> 00:32:54,820
(You did a good job, Your Majesty.)

905
00:32:54,823 --> 00:32:56,190
Sideways.

906
00:32:56,191 --> 00:32:58,620
(Will they get a high score?)

907
00:32:58,626 --> 00:33:01,320
(Yul seems to have danced a lot in the old days.)

908
00:33:01,329 --> 00:33:03,090
(Immersed)

909
00:33:03,098 --> 00:33:05,185
(Worried)

910
00:33:05,734 --> 00:33:07,860
(Here it comes.)

911
00:33:07,869 --> 00:33:10,795
(Yul's turning dance)

912
00:33:10,839 --> 00:33:13,865
(They're still deciding which song to sing.)

913
00:33:13,875 --> 00:33:16,270
(He sings the last line...)

914
00:33:16,277 --> 00:33:19,180
(at the top of his lungs.)

915
00:33:19,180 --> 00:33:20,910
(The passionate performance is over.)

916
00:33:20,915 --> 00:33:22,405
Please.

917
00:33:22,484 --> 00:33:28,445
(If their score is higher than 93, Team King Seok Jin will be out.)

918
00:33:31,259 --> 00:33:34,315
(Their score is 94, which is only 1 point higher.)

919
00:33:34,996 --> 00:33:37,925
(Team King Seok Jin is out.)

920
00:33:38,333 --> 00:33:39,860
We beat one team.

921
00:33:39,868 --> 00:33:41,100
- Good job. - Good job.

922
00:33:41,102 --> 00:33:42,770
- Yul. - Yul.

923
00:33:42,771 --> 00:33:44,100
- Good job. - It was nice.

924
00:33:44,105 --> 00:33:45,570
- A Ra. - It was amazing.

925
00:33:45,573 --> 00:33:47,095
(It's Team King Il Woo's turn.)

926
00:33:47,308 --> 00:33:48,410
- Good job. - Crying Nut?

927
00:33:48,410 --> 00:33:49,410
("Speed Up, Losers" by Crying Nut)

928
00:33:49,411 --> 00:33:52,010
- Right? - It usually gives you a high score.

929
00:33:52,013 --> 00:33:53,680
It's very fun.

930
00:33:53,681 --> 00:33:56,045
- It'll be amazing. - It's a fun song.

931
00:33:56,751 --> 00:34:00,820
(It starts out calm.)

932
00:34:00,822 --> 00:34:03,415
(Jong Kook warms up his voice.)

933
00:34:03,425 --> 00:34:04,550
(Let's go.)

934
00:34:04,559 --> 00:34:06,285
(Shut it!)

935
00:34:06,594 --> 00:34:08,785
(It's time to scream.)

936
00:34:08,997 --> 00:34:10,290
(It's getting more and more fun.)

937
00:34:10,298 --> 00:34:12,730
- It's getting fun. - Here we go.

938
00:34:12,734 --> 00:34:14,455
It's time.

939
00:34:14,803 --> 00:34:16,030
Let's go.

940
00:34:16,037 --> 00:34:19,300
(Let's speed up towards a high score.)

941
00:34:19,307 --> 00:34:20,965
(Running)

942
00:34:21,976 --> 00:34:24,410
What is he doing?

943
00:34:24,412 --> 00:34:26,880
(Even a member of the losing team is having fun.)

944
00:34:26,881 --> 00:34:29,050
(It's a mess.)

945
00:34:29,050 --> 00:34:31,880
(But it doesn't affect the singing and dancing.)

946
00:34:31,886 --> 00:34:33,620
What are you doing?

947
00:34:33,621 --> 00:34:37,020
(What are you all doing there?)

948
00:34:37,025 --> 00:34:38,190
(Splash)

949
00:34:38,193 --> 00:34:39,360
What are you doing?

950
00:34:39,360 --> 00:34:43,455
(They do their best to the end.)

951
00:34:43,898 --> 00:34:44,990
(Despite all the disturbance...)

952
00:34:44,999 --> 00:34:46,000
Is it over?

953
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:47,600
(They managed to finish the song.)

954
00:34:47,602 --> 00:34:53,400
(If their score is higher than 94, Team King Il Woo will win.)

955
00:34:53,408 --> 00:34:55,970
- Oh, my. - We win!

956
00:34:55,977 --> 00:34:58,410
(Team King Il Woo has to put down 1.)

957
00:34:58,413 --> 00:34:59,810
We won with "As I Told You"!

958
00:34:59,814 --> 00:35:02,010
- "As I Told You". - What's our score?

959
00:35:02,016 --> 00:35:04,610
- Team King Seok Jin... - 83.

960
00:35:04,619 --> 00:35:07,280
Hoon picked the song.

961
00:35:07,288 --> 00:35:09,785
(Complaining)

962
00:35:09,858 --> 00:35:10,890
Hoon...

963
00:35:10,892 --> 00:35:13,190
(You had fun.)

964
00:35:13,194 --> 00:35:14,760
- It's 2 to 2. - It's 2 to 2.

965
00:35:14,762 --> 00:35:16,090
- We have a chance. - All right.

966
00:35:16,097 --> 00:35:18,030
- Okay. - It's our turn to attack.

967
00:35:18,032 --> 00:35:19,400
Okay.

968
00:35:19,400 --> 00:35:20,955
Kim Jong Kook, fold your finger.

969
00:35:21,803 --> 00:35:25,595
(Straightforward)

970
00:35:26,708 --> 00:35:29,140
This is...

971
00:35:29,144 --> 00:35:31,740
Fold your finger.

972
00:35:31,746 --> 00:35:34,310
- Should we... - Let's go with facts.

973
00:35:34,315 --> 00:35:35,810
Those wearing glasses, fold your fingers.

974
00:35:35,817 --> 00:35:38,180
(They fight back with facts.)

975
00:35:38,186 --> 00:35:39,180
(Jae Seok takes off his glasses.)

976
00:35:39,187 --> 00:35:42,120
You should have taken them off before the question.

977
00:35:42,123 --> 00:35:44,845
You have such deep marks.

978
00:35:44,893 --> 00:35:46,790
What are those lines?

979
00:35:46,794 --> 00:35:48,360
Be quiet. Okay.

980
00:35:48,363 --> 00:35:49,490
- Put one down. - Okay.

981
00:35:49,497 --> 00:35:52,400
It's the staff's turn to ask a question.

982
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:53,500
- Okay. - Okay.

983
00:35:53,501 --> 00:35:55,270
- This will determine the result. - Be fair.

984
00:35:55,270 --> 00:35:57,600
The losers of a ddakji game will fold their fingers.

985
00:35:57,605 --> 00:35:59,170
Okay. Jae Seok.

986
00:35:59,174 --> 00:36:00,770
(The losers of a ddakji game will fold their fingers.)

987
00:36:00,775 --> 00:36:02,370
It's time for Yu Hyuk to step up.

988
00:36:02,377 --> 00:36:04,410
- Yu Hyuk. - Yu Hyuk. We trust you.

989
00:36:04,412 --> 00:36:06,510
Both teams have good players.

990
00:36:06,514 --> 00:36:07,680
(I'm good at it too.)

991
00:36:07,682 --> 00:36:09,210
Will they take turns?

992
00:36:09,217 --> 00:36:11,545
You have to beat all members. Okay.

993
00:36:12,420 --> 00:36:13,880
Hit the center.

994
00:36:13,888 --> 00:36:14,880
So Min, hit the center.

995
00:36:14,889 --> 00:36:16,820
It's not easy.

996
00:36:16,824 --> 00:36:17,920
Hit the center.

997
00:36:17,926 --> 00:36:19,920
Don't use too much force.

998
00:36:19,928 --> 00:36:21,930
(So Min attacks first.)

999
00:36:21,930 --> 00:36:24,460
(It's powerful.)

1000
00:36:24,465 --> 00:36:29,400
(A Ra's ddakji is flipped halfway. She might lose.)

1001
00:36:29,404 --> 00:36:30,400
Good.

1002
00:36:30,405 --> 00:36:32,200
(It didn't flip.)

1003
00:36:32,207 --> 00:36:33,400
- Okay. - Hit the center.

1004
00:36:33,408 --> 00:36:35,935
- The center? - Just hit it.

1005
00:36:35,944 --> 00:36:38,040
(It's A Ra's turn to attack.)

1006
00:36:38,046 --> 00:36:39,040
Stay calm.

1007
00:36:39,047 --> 00:36:40,775
(Her ddakji hits So Min's.)

1008
00:36:40,882 --> 00:36:44,180
(Will So Min's flip?)

1009
00:36:44,185 --> 00:36:46,680
(It flipped.)

1010
00:36:46,688 --> 00:36:48,080
- A Ra. - Okay!

1011
00:36:48,089 --> 00:36:50,190
(I'm the ddakji queen.)

1012
00:36:50,191 --> 00:36:52,290
- She is strong. - Good job.

1013
00:36:52,293 --> 00:36:54,690
- A Ra. - Good job.

1014
00:36:54,696 --> 00:36:56,590
- I knew it. - Good job.

1015
00:36:56,598 --> 00:36:58,130
- Yul. - Yes.

1016
00:36:58,132 --> 00:37:01,200
- It flipped. - A Ra knows how to do it.

1017
00:37:01,202 --> 00:37:03,570
- Yul will flip it at once. - What?

1018
00:37:03,571 --> 00:37:04,930
Yul will flip it at once.

1019
00:37:04,939 --> 00:37:07,570
(He hits the floor.)

1020
00:37:07,575 --> 00:37:10,070
What was that?

1021
00:37:10,078 --> 00:37:11,670
What did you do?

1022
00:37:11,679 --> 00:37:13,610
You surprised me.

1023
00:37:13,615 --> 00:37:15,580
Am I seeing things?

1024
00:37:15,583 --> 00:37:17,080
Next time, I'll flip it.

1025
00:37:17,085 --> 00:37:19,280
- I'm all set now. - Right?

1026
00:37:19,287 --> 00:37:20,280
(A Ra feels confident.)

1027
00:37:20,288 --> 00:37:21,320
She'll flip it.

1028
00:37:21,322 --> 00:37:23,085
(She attacks.)

1029
00:37:23,658 --> 00:37:26,460
(Yul's ddakji is lifted.)

1030
00:37:26,461 --> 00:37:28,490
- It's okay. You did well. - That was close.

1031
00:37:28,496 --> 00:37:30,785
- A Ra knows how to do it. - That was close.

1032
00:37:30,798 --> 00:37:32,300
Yul, are you all set?

1033
00:37:32,300 --> 00:37:34,860
- I am. - Be careful. It's dangerous.

1034
00:37:34,869 --> 00:37:36,570
Be careful. You might get hurt.

1035
00:37:36,571 --> 00:37:38,500
(Will he be able to flip the ddakji this time?)

1036
00:37:38,506 --> 00:37:40,635
- Yul... - He is athletic.

1037
00:37:41,976 --> 00:37:46,035
(He flipped the ddakji perfectly.)

1038
00:37:46,147 --> 00:37:47,610
- Nice! - Yul.

1039
00:37:47,615 --> 00:37:49,610
- Good job. - Once he is set...

1040
00:37:49,617 --> 00:37:52,020
- Good job. - It's 1 to 1.

1041
00:37:52,020 --> 00:37:53,580
Which one is ours? This one?

1042
00:37:53,588 --> 00:37:55,120
Move it to the center. Hold on.

1043
00:37:55,123 --> 00:37:57,315
(It has to be here.)

1044
00:37:57,558 --> 00:38:01,190
(Jong Kook kindly moves Ji Hyo's ddakji.)

1045
00:38:01,195 --> 00:38:03,890
Jong Kook, show her how you do it.

1046
00:38:03,898 --> 00:38:06,100
She's good. I'm not doing it because of you.

1047
00:38:06,100 --> 00:38:07,300
(I won't fall for it.)

1048
00:38:07,302 --> 00:38:09,300
(Exposed)

1049
00:38:09,304 --> 00:38:11,200
You'll tease me, right?

1050
00:38:11,205 --> 00:38:13,200
You'll start it again. I'm not doing it.

1051
00:38:13,207 --> 00:38:14,870
- I won't do it. - Jong Kook is bothered.

1052
00:38:14,876 --> 00:38:16,640
- He is bothered. - I'm not doing it.

1053
00:38:16,644 --> 00:38:18,270
Just hit it.

1054
00:38:18,279 --> 00:38:20,635
(Ji Hyo tries.)

1055
00:38:20,682 --> 00:38:22,280
- Good job. - She is all set now.

1056
00:38:22,283 --> 00:38:23,880
- Good job. - Good job.

1057
00:38:23,885 --> 00:38:26,350
- I'll flip it. - You should.

1058
00:38:26,354 --> 00:38:28,515
(You have to flip it.)

1059
00:38:28,723 --> 00:38:29,890
(He gets ready...)

1060
00:38:29,891 --> 00:38:30,990
(and hits the ddakji.)

1061
00:38:30,992 --> 00:38:32,620
Okay!

1062
00:38:32,627 --> 00:38:34,020
(He flips it this time too.)

1063
00:38:34,028 --> 00:38:35,660
- Nice! - Kwon Yul's power.

1064
00:38:35,663 --> 00:38:37,425
- Good job! - Yes!

1065
00:38:37,532 --> 00:38:39,000
- Okay. - Il Woo, are you good at it?

1066
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:40,760
- You should be better than me. - I never tried it.

1067
00:38:40,768 --> 00:38:42,370
- Never? - No.

1068
00:38:42,370 --> 00:38:43,800
That's great.

1069
00:38:43,805 --> 00:38:45,900
- Let's go. - Just hit it.

1070
00:38:45,907 --> 00:38:49,010
(King Il Woo comes out to stop So Min's kingdom from winning.)

1071
00:38:49,010 --> 00:38:50,140
Jong Kook is playing too.

1072
00:38:50,144 --> 00:38:54,240
(How skilled is King Il Woo?)

1073
00:38:54,248 --> 00:38:56,145
- He's never done it. - He never has.

1074
00:38:58,152 --> 00:39:00,220
(The way he plays is obviously awkward.)

1075
00:39:00,221 --> 00:39:01,750
- He's never done it. - He never has.

1076
00:39:01,756 --> 00:39:04,890
How could you hold ddakji like this? He grabbed it like this.

1077
00:39:04,892 --> 00:39:06,590
He's quite strong.

1078
00:39:06,594 --> 00:39:08,085
All right.

1079
00:39:08,730 --> 00:39:10,190
(Yul does it without hesitating.)

1080
00:39:10,198 --> 00:39:11,990
(Bam)

1081
00:39:11,999 --> 00:39:14,400
(It's 1 shot, 1 kill.)

1082
00:39:14,402 --> 00:39:15,430
(He eliminates 3 people instantly.)

1083
00:39:15,436 --> 00:39:17,170
- Yul is good. - All right.

1084
00:39:17,171 --> 00:39:22,140
- Yul is very good. - Just defeat Jong Kook.

1085
00:39:22,143 --> 00:39:23,710
(Only Jong Kook remains.)

1086
00:39:23,711 --> 00:39:26,775
(Is it time for me to take action?)

1087
00:39:27,014 --> 00:39:28,710
(His strength is enough to break the ground.)

1088
00:39:28,716 --> 00:39:31,345
(He's an authentic strong player who never fails to turn ddakji.)

1089
00:39:31,886 --> 00:39:33,850
(Will it be the strong player?)

1090
00:39:33,855 --> 00:39:36,645
(Will it be up-and-coming player?)

1091
00:39:36,958 --> 00:39:37,990
Let's go.

1092
00:39:37,992 --> 00:39:39,360
(There's no place to back down.)

1093
00:39:39,360 --> 00:39:40,760
Wait.

1094
00:39:40,762 --> 00:39:42,560
(Thud)

1095
00:39:42,563 --> 00:39:44,630
- Didn't he throw it? - That was strong.

1096
00:39:44,632 --> 00:39:46,955
(There's no practice.)

1097
00:39:48,269 --> 00:39:50,425
- Ji Hyo, encourage him. - It doesn't hit accurately.

1098
00:39:51,472 --> 00:39:54,100
(Thud)

1099
00:39:54,108 --> 00:39:56,810
(Victory of Il Woo's team depends on Jong Kook.)

1100
00:39:56,811 --> 00:40:00,480
(Will Jong Kook stop them from winning ddakji?)

1101
00:40:00,481 --> 00:40:03,010
(It didn't flip.)

1102
00:40:03,017 --> 00:40:04,610
That's unfortunate.

1103
00:40:04,619 --> 00:40:06,020
(One is happy, and the other is sad.)

1104
00:40:06,020 --> 00:40:09,285
- We still have a chance. - Come on, Yul.

1105
00:40:09,524 --> 00:40:10,690
If you succeed, we win.

1106
00:40:10,691 --> 00:40:12,585
- Right. - Yul, let's go.

1107
00:40:13,194 --> 00:40:15,490
(Without hesitation, )

1108
00:40:15,496 --> 00:40:17,560
(he throws his ddakji.)

1109
00:40:17,565 --> 00:40:21,500
(Will So Min's team win? Or will Il Woo's team get a chance?)

1110
00:40:21,502 --> 00:40:23,925
(He flips it again.)

1111
00:40:24,672 --> 00:40:27,370
(Il Woo conquers it all by himself.)

1112
00:40:27,375 --> 00:40:29,540
Is it over? Did Jong Kook lose?

1113
00:40:29,544 --> 00:40:30,810
(King of ddakji, Yul does a splendid job.)

1114
00:40:30,812 --> 00:40:32,565
He's very good.

1115
00:40:32,580 --> 00:40:34,710
- I got a hold of it. - Okay.

1116
00:40:34,715 --> 00:40:36,480
- Okay. - What happened?

1117
00:40:36,484 --> 00:40:37,880
(Didn't I tell you? I got a hold of it.)

1118
00:40:37,885 --> 00:40:39,920
The winner of this mission is...

1119
00:40:39,921 --> 00:40:42,175
Team King So Min.

1120
00:40:42,723 --> 00:40:45,250
- Our teamwork was great. - Pardon?

1121
00:40:45,259 --> 00:40:46,320
The king of the winning team is...

1122
00:40:46,327 --> 00:40:48,090
given a treason right, a hint,

1123
00:40:48,095 --> 00:40:50,290
- and a recruitment right. - To the king?

1124
00:40:50,298 --> 00:40:53,225
- Is it only the king? - I bet she's fake.

1125
00:40:53,634 --> 00:40:56,195
Keep it hidden. Let's look at it together.

1126
00:40:56,437 --> 00:40:59,900
(What hint does King So Min receive?)

1127
00:40:59,907 --> 00:41:01,340
"As his jaw is hard,"

1128
00:41:01,342 --> 00:41:05,035
"the real king is responsible, but he has more desire than luck."

1129
00:41:06,747 --> 00:41:09,135
Isn't it me?

1130
00:41:09,817 --> 00:41:13,250
(Is So Min the real king?)

1131
00:41:13,254 --> 00:41:15,950
(Which one of them is the real king?)

1132
00:41:15,957 --> 00:41:17,620
Who shall we recruit?

1133
00:41:17,625 --> 00:41:20,420
They're increasing. We should win games no matter what.

1134
00:41:20,428 --> 00:41:22,290
- Who is someone... - Easy to order around?

1135
00:41:22,296 --> 00:41:24,155
easy to order around?

1136
00:41:24,866 --> 00:41:26,855
- Someone who is... - Who do you recommend?

1137
00:41:27,735 --> 00:41:29,500
(Who's someone easy to order around?)

1138
00:41:29,504 --> 00:41:31,695
(The one who's standing)

1139
00:41:31,906 --> 00:41:33,340
- In that case... - King So Min.

1140
00:41:33,341 --> 00:41:35,340
- Please make the decision. - Okay.

1141
00:41:35,343 --> 00:41:36,440
I pick Kwang Soo.

1142
00:41:36,444 --> 00:41:37,540
(It's Lee Kwang Soo.)

1143
00:41:37,545 --> 00:41:38,570
(He's easy to order around.)

1144
00:41:38,579 --> 00:41:40,210
Give me the hint.

1145
00:41:40,214 --> 00:41:42,780
I knew that he'd be picked.

1146
00:41:42,783 --> 00:41:44,575
It couldn't be helped.

1147
00:41:44,652 --> 00:41:45,650
That's how he is.

1148
00:41:45,653 --> 00:41:47,780
(He changes his nationality without regrets.)

1149
00:41:47,788 --> 00:41:49,485
That's how he is.

1150
00:41:50,024 --> 00:41:51,520
- That's him. - You'll be the youngest.

1151
00:41:51,526 --> 00:41:52,990
- You'll be the youngest. - Thank you.

1152
00:41:52,994 --> 00:41:55,260
You'll be the youngest.

1153
00:41:55,263 --> 00:41:57,290
- You're the youngest. - Since you're the youngest,

1154
00:41:57,298 --> 00:41:59,260
- He's the youngest. - be good to us.

1155
00:41:59,267 --> 00:42:01,255
- They should like you. - Yes, sir.

1156
00:42:01,869 --> 00:42:02,930
How about the treason right?

1157
00:42:02,937 --> 00:42:04,800
- Who wants it? - The king may...

1158
00:42:04,805 --> 00:42:06,840
give out the treason right.

1159
00:42:06,841 --> 00:42:09,810
- Who do you trust the most? - Right.

1160
00:42:09,810 --> 00:42:12,070
He flipped most ddakji.

1161
00:42:12,079 --> 00:42:13,480
He's most accomplished.

1162
00:42:13,481 --> 00:42:14,680
(She gives Yul a treason right.)

1163
00:42:14,682 --> 00:42:16,750
- Thank you very much. - You're welcome.

1164
00:42:16,751 --> 00:42:18,545
That's the right thing to do.

1165
00:42:18,920 --> 00:42:20,080
Can you share the hint with me?

1166
00:42:20,087 --> 00:42:22,985
We'll decide after we discuss.

1167
00:42:23,591 --> 00:42:25,090
(Are they acting territorial?)

1168
00:42:25,092 --> 00:42:27,120
- What do you mean? - You don't get...

1169
00:42:27,128 --> 00:42:28,690
citizenship automatically.

1170
00:42:28,696 --> 00:42:29,990
- That will be later. - You aren't a citizen yet.

1171
00:42:29,997 --> 00:42:32,130
We need to review your identity first.

1172
00:42:32,133 --> 00:42:33,430
What about my ID?

1173
00:42:33,434 --> 00:42:35,670
- You're wearing blue. - Your color is different.

1174
00:42:35,670 --> 00:42:37,770
Let's move to the next mission.

1175
00:42:37,772 --> 00:42:38,940
(Current team status)

1176
00:42:38,940 --> 00:42:41,695
(Yul has a treason right.)

1177
00:42:41,943 --> 00:42:44,470
(After a new citizen is invited to So Min's kingdom...)

1178
00:42:44,478 --> 00:42:45,980
Gosh, what's this?

1179
00:42:45,980 --> 00:42:47,010
(King So Min finds a menu.)

1180
00:42:47,014 --> 00:42:48,440
Do we earn it?

1181
00:42:48,449 --> 00:42:49,450
That's right.

1182
00:42:49,450 --> 00:42:50,550
(Various dishes are written.)

1183
00:42:50,551 --> 00:42:51,910
By the way,

1184
00:42:51,919 --> 00:42:54,020
I don't know if I can say this.

1185
00:42:54,021 --> 00:42:56,120
Both the king...

1186
00:42:56,123 --> 00:42:58,490
and one of your people are sick.

1187
00:42:58,492 --> 00:43:00,520
There can be sick people.

1188
00:43:00,528 --> 00:43:02,960
One of your people feels awkward.

1189
00:43:02,964 --> 00:43:05,090
He doesn't feel awkward at all.

1190
00:43:05,099 --> 00:43:07,130
We're having so much fun.

1191
00:43:07,134 --> 00:43:10,165
(He gets very close to him.)

1192
00:43:10,738 --> 00:43:11,800
We're having so much fun.

1193
00:43:11,806 --> 00:43:13,470
(What was that?)

1194
00:43:13,474 --> 00:43:14,500
What?

1195
00:43:14,508 --> 00:43:16,440
- What are you doing? - We got close.

1196
00:43:16,444 --> 00:43:19,575
Hoon and I have known each other for a while.

1197
00:43:19,680 --> 00:43:20,710
He made a physical contact.

1198
00:43:20,715 --> 00:43:22,010
(King Seok Jin's physical contact)

1199
00:43:22,016 --> 00:43:23,450
Wait.

1200
00:43:23,451 --> 00:43:25,980
Our slave shouldn't use a sitting mat.

1201
00:43:25,987 --> 00:43:27,480
Move.

1202
00:43:27,488 --> 00:43:29,450
(It's already sad that he's a slave.)

1203
00:43:29,457 --> 00:43:30,450
(His sitting mat is taken.)

1204
00:43:30,458 --> 00:43:32,545
- Why? - Give it to me.

1205
00:43:33,494 --> 00:43:36,255
Why did you join their team?

1206
00:43:36,263 --> 00:43:37,890
Don't I look like a mercenary?

1207
00:43:37,898 --> 00:43:39,700
- No. - I'm not a slave.

1208
00:43:39,700 --> 00:43:41,000
- Watch it. - Watch it.

1209
00:43:41,002 --> 00:43:43,130
You should have sat in between two kingdoms.

1210
00:43:43,137 --> 00:43:44,995
You'll start an epidemic.

1211
00:43:45,339 --> 00:43:49,195
(It's a dangerous zone for an epidemic.)

1212
00:43:49,477 --> 00:43:51,365
That's why you're sitting there.

1213
00:43:51,579 --> 00:43:53,140
This is your next mission.

1214
00:43:53,147 --> 00:43:56,780
It's called Royal Table Coins.

1215
00:43:56,784 --> 00:43:58,050
(Royal Table Coins)

1216
00:43:58,052 --> 00:44:01,080
Each team will push a lid that you see in front of you.

1217
00:44:01,088 --> 00:44:04,350
You obtain a dish, and that will be your lunch menu.

1218
00:44:04,358 --> 00:44:06,520
- It's difficult. - It's very difficult.

1219
00:44:06,527 --> 00:44:09,655
There are no bad side dishes.

1220
00:44:09,664 --> 00:44:11,460
All members will play.

1221
00:44:11,465 --> 00:44:14,730
The team with the highest score wins.

1222
00:44:14,735 --> 00:44:17,530
Determine the order of play. The order is very important.

1223
00:44:17,538 --> 00:44:19,770
- It could bounce off. - Let me think.

1224
00:44:19,774 --> 00:44:21,340
- It's like curling. - This is important.

1225
00:44:21,342 --> 00:44:22,710
- The last team. - How about this way?

1226
00:44:22,710 --> 00:44:25,040
Let's play a simple team game...

1227
00:44:25,046 --> 00:44:26,510
and determine the order.

1228
00:44:26,514 --> 00:44:28,710
Is there any game you play, A Ra?

1229
00:44:28,716 --> 00:44:30,880
- No. - There isn't?

1230
00:44:30,885 --> 00:44:32,210
Is there a game you're good at, Hoon?

1231
00:44:32,219 --> 00:44:33,620
(What about Hoon?)

1232
00:44:33,621 --> 00:44:34,780
How about Initial Consonant Game?

1233
00:44:34,789 --> 00:44:36,320
- Initial Consonant Game? - That sounds good.

1234
00:44:36,323 --> 00:44:38,850
(They agree on Initial Consonant Game.)

1235
00:44:38,859 --> 00:44:39,920
Let's play in teams.

1236
00:44:39,927 --> 00:44:40,990
- That sounds good. - Initial Consonant Game?

1237
00:44:40,995 --> 00:44:42,660
Let's play that.

1238
00:44:42,663 --> 00:44:44,290
If it's K and S, each person plays.

1239
00:44:44,298 --> 00:44:46,100
- Then everyone takes a turn. - Right.

1240
00:44:46,100 --> 00:44:47,860
People who don't answer get eliminated.

1241
00:44:47,868 --> 00:44:50,000
As soon as someone is eliminated, the consonant changes.

1242
00:44:50,004 --> 00:44:51,670
- Okay. - That's right.

1243
00:44:51,672 --> 00:44:53,240
Start.

1244
00:44:53,240 --> 00:44:57,740
- Initial Consonant Game - Initial Consonant Game

1245
00:44:57,745 --> 00:44:59,840
(N and M)

1246
00:44:59,847 --> 00:45:01,410
Tree.

1247
00:45:01,415 --> 00:45:02,905
Tear.

1248
00:45:02,917 --> 00:45:04,405
Aged mother.

1249
00:45:04,552 --> 00:45:06,875
(They start off well.)

1250
00:45:07,288 --> 00:45:08,780
Aged mother.

1251
00:45:08,789 --> 00:45:10,315
Cold noodles.

1252
00:45:11,225 --> 00:45:13,255
I knew this would happen.

1253
00:45:13,527 --> 00:45:15,360
(N and M?)

1254
00:45:15,362 --> 00:45:18,130
(Let me think.)

1255
00:45:18,132 --> 00:45:21,130
(Ji Hyo from Team King Il Woo is eliminated.)

1256
00:45:21,135 --> 00:45:23,200
Ji Hyo is terrible at games.

1257
00:45:23,204 --> 00:45:24,470
That was expected.

1258
00:45:24,472 --> 00:45:27,470
- A Ra starts with new consonants. - Start with A Ra.

1259
00:45:27,475 --> 00:45:30,240
- Initial Consonant Game - Initial Consonant Game

1260
00:45:30,244 --> 00:45:32,740
(S and K)

1261
00:45:32,747 --> 00:45:33,910
Apple.

1262
00:45:33,914 --> 00:45:36,010
(She starts one beat later.)

1263
00:45:36,016 --> 00:45:38,305
- Effort. - The beat is off.

1264
00:45:38,619 --> 00:45:40,275
It's offbeat.

1265
00:45:40,321 --> 00:45:41,815
Thought.

1266
00:45:42,456 --> 00:45:43,890
Success.

1267
00:45:43,891 --> 00:45:45,320
Resident director.

1268
00:45:45,326 --> 00:45:46,790
Ginger.

1269
00:45:46,794 --> 00:45:48,320
Towel.

1270
00:45:48,329 --> 00:45:49,430
"Ginger" was strange.

1271
00:45:49,430 --> 00:45:51,390
- What's wrong with that? - A moment ago...

1272
00:45:51,398 --> 00:45:54,500
(Wasn't it strange a moment ago?)

1273
00:45:54,502 --> 00:45:56,100
What's the problem?

1274
00:45:56,103 --> 00:45:58,570
I thought "ginger" was repeated.

1275
00:45:58,572 --> 00:46:01,035
- No, it was "thought". - "Thought" and "ginger".

1276
00:46:01,542 --> 00:46:03,540
Oh, I see.

1277
00:46:03,544 --> 00:46:06,335
(Oh, I see.)

1278
00:46:06,714 --> 00:46:08,510
- You just ruined my turn. - Wait.

1279
00:46:08,516 --> 00:46:10,510
(What do you mean by that?)

1280
00:46:10,518 --> 00:46:12,180
- What? - How could you?

1281
00:46:12,186 --> 00:46:14,320
- We have to complain. - What's wrong with you?

1282
00:46:14,321 --> 00:46:17,220
I'll apologize.

1283
00:46:17,224 --> 00:46:18,450
Apologizing isn't enough.

1284
00:46:18,459 --> 00:46:19,920
My hearing isn't good.

1285
00:46:19,927 --> 00:46:21,320
Your hearing?

1286
00:46:21,328 --> 00:46:23,090
(Your hearing?)

1287
00:46:23,097 --> 00:46:25,190
(How could you?)

1288
00:46:25,199 --> 00:46:26,330
(That's what he says.)

1289
00:46:26,333 --> 00:46:27,330
Wait.

1290
00:46:27,334 --> 00:46:29,060
A Ra and Il Woo.

1291
00:46:29,069 --> 00:46:30,130
(Play with the right beat.)

1292
00:46:30,137 --> 00:46:32,070
"Ginger". Stay with the beat.

1293
00:46:32,072 --> 00:46:34,000
- Don't say "ginger". - Okay.

1294
00:46:34,008 --> 00:46:35,300
Does Seok Jin start?

1295
00:46:35,309 --> 00:46:36,470
- A Ra goes first. - No, it's your turn.

1296
00:46:36,477 --> 00:46:37,770
- Mine? - Yes.

1297
00:46:37,778 --> 00:46:39,940
We'll do it faster. 1, 2, 3, 4.

1298
00:46:39,947 --> 00:46:42,180
- Initial Consonant Game - Initial Consonant Game

1299

00:46:44,685 --> 00:46:45,780
Tuning.

1301
00:46:45,786 --> 00:46:46,950
Chang Ung.

1302
00:46:46,954 --> 00:46:48,150
Father-in-law.

1303
00:46:48,155 --> 00:46:49,490
Acupressure.

1304
00:46:49,490 --> 00:46:51,215
Jang Hwang?

1305
00:46:51,525 --> 00:46:54,860
(She was busy with the beat and coming up with a word.)

1306
00:46:54,862 --> 00:46:56,530
- What? - J and O are difficult.

1307
00:46:56,530 --> 00:46:58,430
J and O are difficult.

1308
00:46:58,432 --> 00:47:00,530
Here we go. We start with Il Woo.

1309
00:47:00,534 --> 00:47:01,830
- Start. - It's difficult.

1310
00:47:01,836 --> 00:47:04,330
- Initial Consonant Game - Initial Consonant Game

1311
00:47:04,338 --> 00:47:05,330
Freight vehicle.

1312
00:47:05,339 --> 00:47:06,835
(He ignores the beat.)

1313
00:47:06,941 --> 00:47:08,900
- Can't you follow the beat? - Keep the beat.

1314
00:47:08,909 --> 00:47:11,370
Keep the beat. It goes like this.

1315
00:47:11,378 --> 00:47:12,880
(Clap twice and say the word.)

1316
00:47:12,880 --> 00:47:13,910
Start.

1317
00:47:13,914 --> 00:47:16,250
(They restart the game starting with Il Woo.)

1318
00:47:16,250 --> 00:47:17,310
Freight vehicle.

1319
00:47:17,318 --> 00:47:18,750
(He ignores the beat again.)

1320
00:47:18,752 --> 00:47:19,920
- No. - Hey.

1321
00:47:19,920 --> 00:47:20,950
Freight vehicle.

1322
00:47:20,955 --> 00:47:22,320
(I can't hold it anymore.)

1323
00:47:22,323 --> 00:47:23,490
There's a beat.

1324
00:47:23,490 --> 00:47:25,915
- Clap, clap, freight vehicle. - Okay.

1325
00:47:25,926 --> 00:47:28,215
Is he bad with beats?

1326
00:47:28,395 --> 00:47:29,830
- Let's hurry. Get ready. - Did he do it...

1327
00:47:29,830 --> 00:47:30,990
- on purpose? - I got it.

1328
00:47:30,998 --> 00:47:32,130
- Start. - Initial Consonant Game

1329
00:47:32,132 --> 00:47:33,895

00:47:34,368 --> 00:47:35,730

00:47:35,736 --> 00:47:36,930

Black pepper.

1333
00:47:38,305 --> 00:47:39,570
Plant.

1334
00:47:39,573 --> 00:47:40,800
Form.

1335
00:47:40,808 --> 00:47:42,040
Hapcheon.

1336
00:47:42,042 --> 00:47:43,310
Red vinegar.

1337
00:47:43,310 --> 00:47:44,610
Haechi.

1338
00:47:44,612 --> 00:47:46,105
Iris.

1339
00:47:46,947 --> 00:47:48,780
(It's my turn.)

1340
00:47:48,782 --> 00:47:49,950
Wasn't it me?

1341
00:47:49,950 --> 00:47:51,775
He's eliminated.

1342
00:47:52,152 --> 00:47:54,180
(I'm the only one on my team.)

1343
00:47:54,188 --> 00:47:56,615
It's because Jong Kook doesn't want to sit next to me.

1344
00:47:56,790 --> 00:47:58,850
I'm disappointed in him.

1345
00:47:58,859 --> 00:48:00,390
He's been covering his face.

1346
00:48:00,394 --> 00:48:03,325
I thought that he wasn't there.

1347
00:48:03,697 --> 00:48:05,430
It's confusing who's eliminated.

1348
00:48:05,432 --> 00:48:07,060
Those who are eliminated should interlock their fingers.

1349
00:48:07,067 --> 00:48:09,630
(He brings up interlocking fingers again.)

1350
00:48:09,637 --> 00:48:12,025
(She agrees.)

1351
00:48:12,373 --> 00:48:13,940
All right.

1352
00:48:13,941 --> 00:48:16,210
- Who's next? - Haha.

1353
00:48:16,210 --> 00:48:18,070
Start.

Radish?

1357
00:48:23,951 --> 00:48:25,450
He's eliminated.

1358
00:48:25,452 --> 00:48:26,680
- What? - Radish.

1359
00:48:26,687 --> 00:48:28,050
It's one word.

1360
00:48:28,055 --> 00:48:29,820
- The pronunciation isn't long. - It's just radish.

1361
00:48:29,823 --> 00:48:31,550
Let's start with Il Woo.

1362
00:48:31,558 --> 00:48:33,560
Do it on the beat. If you don't, you're eliminated.

1363
00:48:33,560 --> 00:48:34,620
Start.

1364
00:48:34,628 --> 00:48:36,285
(They play again starting with Il Woo.)

1365
00:48:37,598 --> 00:48:38,790
Soo...

1366
00:48:38,799 --> 00:48:39,800
He's eliminated.

1367
00:48:39,800 --> 00:48:41,860
(He hesitates.)

1368
00:48:41,869 --> 00:48:43,400
(He wants to cry.)

1369
00:48:43,404 --> 00:48:45,530
- The red team is eliminated. - This is good.

1370
00:48:45,539 --> 00:48:47,665
I'm nervous.

1371
00:48:47,808 --> 00:48:49,910
- The red team is eliminated. - This is good.

1372
00:48:49,910 --> 00:48:52,880
- It's us and the blue team. Start. - Eliminate two more.

1378
00:49:00,587 --> 00:49:02,020
Unnecessary comment.

1379
00:49:02,022 --> 00:49:04,845
(Our team is so good.)

1380
00:49:05,259 --> 00:49:06,460
Unnecessary comment.

1381
00:49:06,460 --> 00:49:07,660
Exhausted.

1382
00:49:07,661 --> 00:49:09,155
Master.

1383
00:49:09,663 --> 00:49:11,325
I was eliminated.

1384
00:49:11,632 --> 00:49:13,930
(It's not my turn.)

1385
00:49:13,934 --> 00:49:15,455
Was it my turn?

1386
00:49:15,869 --> 00:49:16,900
(He fell in the black hole of the eliminated.)

1387
00:49:16,904 --> 00:49:19,125
He's out.

1388
00:49:19,173 --> 00:49:20,970
- You're out. - You are.

1389
00:49:20,975 --> 00:49:22,240
Move back.

1390
00:49:22,242 --> 00:49:24,070
Only two of us remain.

1391
00:49:24,078 --> 00:49:26,410
- The two of you. - Okay, this is good.

1392
00:49:26,413 --> 00:49:27,980
We need to defeat two people.

1393
00:49:27,982 --> 00:49:29,850
- Let's go. - We're the top.

1394
00:49:29,850 --> 00:49:31,380
This is great.

1395
00:49:31,385 --> 00:49:32,550
Here we go.

00:49:32,553 --> 00:49:33,550
Do I start?

00:49:33,554 --> 00:49:34,980

(K and O)

1403
00:49:43,697 --> 00:49:46,130
(How about gong?)

1404
00:49:46,133 --> 00:49:47,460
There's "common use".

1405
00:49:47,468 --> 00:49:49,060
- Pledge. - Sharing.

1406
00:49:49,069 --> 00:49:51,030
This game is quite difficult.

1407
00:49:51,038 --> 00:49:52,940
- Here we go. - You're out, right?

1408
00:49:52,940 --> 00:49:54,565
Yes, I'm eliminated.

1409
00:49:54,775 --> 00:49:58,005
- Start. Initial Consonant Game - Initial Consonant Game

1410
00:49:58,212 --> 00:49:59,210
Byung. Gosh.

1411
00:49:59,213 --> 00:50:03,305
(He sighs.)

1412
00:50:04,451 --> 00:50:06,775
- Come on. - It couldn't be helped.

1413
00:50:07,554 --> 00:50:09,715
This is too harsh.

1414
00:50:09,857 --> 00:50:12,120
It's 2 to 2. Let's go.

1415
00:50:12,126 --> 00:50:13,260
Okay, do it.

1416
00:50:13,260 --> 00:50:15,020
- Do it. - Okay.

1417

- Initial Consonant Game - Initial Consonant Game

1418
00:50:18,265 --> 00:50:20,725
Cucumber.

1419
00:50:21,001 --> 00:50:22,495
"Eung Eung".

1420
00:50:22,569 --> 00:50:24,470
("Eung Eung"?)

1421
00:50:24,471 --> 00:50:26,000
- What? - There's a song.

1422
00:50:26,006 --> 00:50:27,170
- "Eung Eung". - It's by Apink.

1423
00:50:27,174 --> 00:50:29,100
There's "Eung Eung" by Apink.

1424
00:50:29,109 --> 00:50:31,210
- It was released. - Okay.

1425
00:50:31,211 --> 00:50:33,380
We approve of it. Start.

1426
00:50:33,380 --> 00:50:36,305
- Initial Consonant Game - Initial Consonant Game

1427
00:50:36,483 --> 00:50:37,810
"Eung Eung".

1428
00:50:37,818 --> 00:50:40,315
Milk.

1429
00:50:40,320 --> 00:50:41,320
Cucumber.

1430
00:50:41,321 --> 00:50:43,120
- He already said it. - When?

1431
00:50:43,123 --> 00:50:45,520
(King So Min is eliminated.)

1432
00:50:45,526 --> 00:50:46,920
- When did you say it? - I said cucumber.

1433
00:50:46,927 --> 00:50:48,785
I said it the first time.

1434
00:50:48,896 --> 00:50:50,790
(Tables are turned.)

1435
00:50:50,798 --> 00:50:52,655
Only one remains.

1436
00:50:52,800 --> 00:50:54,060
Okay, Kwang Soo.

1437
00:50:54,068 --> 00:50:55,500
- Kwang Soo starts. - Start.

1438
00:50:55,502 --> 00:50:56,770
- Kwang Soo starts. - Hey.

1439
00:50:56,770 --> 00:50:58,965
- You have to win, Kwang Soo. - Okay.

1440
00:50:59,406 --> 00:51:01,070
- Start. - Kwang Soo.

1441
00:51:01,075 --> 00:51:03,865
- Initial Consonant Game - Initial Consonant Game

1442
00:51:04,578 --> 00:51:07,010
(Consonants given are H and H.)

1443
00:51:07,014 --> 00:51:09,675
(What will Kwang Soo's answer be for H and H?)

1444
00:51:13,487 --> 00:51:15,150
- Start. - Kwang Soo.

1445
00:51:15,155 --> 00:51:17,945
- Initial Consonant Game - Initial Consonant Game

1446
00:51:18,659 --> 00:51:21,090
(Consonants given are H and H.)

1447
00:51:21,095 --> 00:51:23,290
(What will Kwang Soo's answer be for H and H?)

1448
00:51:23,297 --> 00:51:24,785
Hong hong.

1449
00:51:25,566 --> 00:51:28,000
(He laughs.)

1450
00:51:28,001 --> 00:51:29,260
It's H and H.

1451
00:51:29,269 --> 00:51:30,330
(He fails in front of H and H.)

1452
00:51:30,337 --> 00:51:32,825
Seok Jin and Hoon win.

1453
00:51:32,840 --> 00:51:34,470
Hoon is doing well today.

1454
00:51:34,475 --> 00:51:36,605
- He's very good. - Hoon is good.

1455
00:51:36,877 --> 00:51:38,510
- Please determine the order. - We should go last.

1456
00:51:38,512 --> 00:51:40,040
- Am I deciding the order? - Yes.

1457
00:51:40,047 --> 00:51:41,310
(He forgot momentarily.)

1458
00:51:41,315 --> 00:51:43,905
(He just remembers.)

1459
00:51:44,051 --> 00:51:45,350
Decide the order.

1460
00:51:45,352 --> 00:51:47,745
- Order? - Do we get one point?

1461
00:51:48,322 --> 00:51:50,720
That team is our biggest enemy.

1462
00:51:50,724 --> 00:51:52,520
- They should go first. - Goodness.

1463
00:51:52,526 --> 00:51:53,890
(Team King So Min goes first.)

1464
00:51:53,894 --> 00:51:55,060
- We're second. - Okay.

1465
00:51:55,062 --> 00:51:56,960
This is good.

1466
00:51:56,964 --> 00:51:58,490
Decide the order of your players.

1467
00:51:58,499 --> 00:51:59,900
Are we white?

1468
00:51:59,900 --> 00:52:02,155
One of us can't play since there are four.

1469
00:52:02,202 --> 00:52:04,100
- All right. - How shall we do it?

1470
00:52:04,104 --> 00:52:05,770
- Who wants to go first? - By the way...

1471
00:52:05,772 --> 00:52:08,270
By the way, we didn't discuss at all.

1472
00:52:08,275 --> 00:52:10,770
- Will the four of you grab a piece? - Stay still.

1473
00:52:10,777 --> 00:52:12,810
What? I'm a team member too.

1474
00:52:12,813 --> 00:52:14,310
You aren't yet.

1475
00:52:14,314 --> 00:52:16,175
- Wait. - Wait.

1476
00:52:16,316 --> 00:52:17,550
"Wait"?

1477
00:52:17,551 --> 00:52:20,350
Let's have Yul go first.

1478
00:52:20,354 --> 00:52:22,415
- This is ours. - All right.

1479
00:52:22,623 --> 00:52:24,585
- Good luck. - Let's go.

1480
00:52:25,025 --> 00:52:26,090
What do you want to eat?

1481
00:52:26,093 --> 00:52:27,720
- Braised short ribs. - Or spicy stir-fried pork.

1482
00:52:27,728 --> 00:52:29,360
Can you place it where they want?

1483
00:52:29,363 --> 00:52:31,130
- Of course. - Stir-fried sausage sounds good.

1484
00:52:31,131 --> 00:52:32,430
- Sausage? - Stir-fried sausage.

1485
00:52:32,432 --> 00:52:34,560
- I'll go for sausage. - Throw it between sausage...

1486
00:52:34,568 --> 00:52:36,700
- Eggs are good too. - Eggs.

1487
00:52:36,703 --> 00:52:37,930
(Will Yul meet his teammates' expectation?)

1488
00:52:37,938 --> 00:52:39,370
Say start.

1489
00:52:39,373 --> 00:52:40,470
Start.

1490
00:52:40,474 --> 00:52:42,265
(Yul from Team King So Min starts.)

1491
00:52:42,943 --> 00:52:44,765
(Flicking)

1492
00:52:44,878 --> 00:52:48,140
(He throws it toward sausage.)

1493
00:52:48,148 --> 00:52:49,310
Goodness.

1494
00:52:49,316 --> 00:52:51,175
(It goes out.)

1495
00:52:51,318 --> 00:52:53,080
(It falls off the table.)

1496
00:52:53,086 --> 00:52:54,945
That was great.

1497
00:52:56,356 --> 00:52:58,590
- I'm sorry. - How did you do that?

1498
00:52:58,592 --> 00:53:00,090
(I'm sorry?)

1499
00:53:00,093 --> 00:53:02,560
It should have gone to the middle.

1500
00:53:02,563 --> 00:53:04,290
(He just laughs.)

1501
00:53:04,298 --> 00:53:06,255
He was so confident.

1502
00:53:06,400 --> 00:53:07,730
Next team.

1503
00:53:07,734 --> 00:53:09,700
- It's us. - Is it us?

1504
00:53:09,703 --> 00:53:11,670
- This could be good strategically. - We're in trouble.

1505
00:53:11,672 --> 00:53:13,200
Send it to the side.

1506
00:53:13,207 --> 00:53:14,970
We can push theirs off.

1507
00:53:14,975 --> 00:53:17,035
- Start. - You can do it.

1508
00:53:17,344 --> 00:53:19,210
Il Woo is quite bad at games.

1509
00:53:19,213 --> 00:53:20,910
- He's actually sloppy. - He couldn't follow the beat.

1510
00:53:20,914 --> 00:53:22,910
- Are you a bad dancer? - He has no sense of beat.

1511
00:53:22,916 --> 00:53:24,910
(Will he succeed despite being bothered?)

1512
00:53:24,918 --> 00:53:27,245
(Flicking)

1513
00:53:28,455 --> 00:53:30,450
That was good. We scored 10 points.

1514
00:53:30,457 --> 00:53:31,890
Is it zero?

1515
00:53:31,892 --> 00:53:33,620
(Soy sauce is 0 point.)

1516
00:53:33,627 --> 00:53:35,160
It's zero point.

1517
00:53:35,162 --> 00:53:37,890
He got soy sauce.

1518
00:53:37,898 --> 00:53:39,925
That's hilarious.

1519
00:53:39,933 --> 00:53:41,930
We have zero points.

1520
00:53:41,935 --> 00:53:43,100
This isn't safe.

1521
00:53:43,103 --> 00:53:45,195
- Let's go. - Let's go, Haha.

1522
00:53:45,672 --> 00:53:46,770
He has a cold.

1523
00:53:46,773 --> 00:53:49,765
Go for spicy stir-fried pork. It's the safest.

1524
00:53:50,644 --> 00:53:52,635
(Flicking)

1525
00:53:53,647 --> 00:53:54,740
(It goes out.)

1526
00:53:54,748 --> 00:53:56,250
Why are you so strong? Aren't you sick?

1527
00:53:56,250 --> 00:53:57,510
(My goodness)

1528
00:53:57,517 --> 00:53:58,580
It's difficult.

1529
00:53:58,585 --> 00:54:00,320
(It's Team King So Min's turn again.)

1530
00:54:00,320 --> 00:54:02,350
- Se Chan. - Show us, Se Chan.

1531
00:54:02,356 --> 00:54:03,690
Se Chan.

1532
00:54:03,690 --> 00:54:04,750
Let's do it.

1533
00:54:04,758 --> 00:54:06,390
I'm really good at this game.

1534
00:54:06,393 --> 00:54:08,785
(He mumbles to himself.)

1535
00:54:10,297 --> 00:54:12,030
(Be quiet.)

1536
00:54:12,032 --> 00:54:13,260
Be quiet.

1537
00:54:13,267 --> 00:54:14,560
(He's trying to concentrate.)

1538
00:54:14,568 --> 00:54:16,400
We didn't call you for this.

1539
00:54:16,403 --> 00:54:19,200
(He gets sad.)

1540
00:54:19,206 --> 00:54:20,695
(What?)

1541
00:54:22,776 --> 00:54:24,340
(It stops at stir-fried sausage.)

1542
00:54:24,344 --> 00:54:25,640
- Stir-fried sausage. - 1 point.

1543
00:54:25,646 --> 00:54:27,480
(This is amazing.)

1544
00:54:27,481 --> 00:54:29,010
This isn't bad.

1545
00:54:29,016 --> 00:54:30,280
That was amazing. Good job.

1546
00:54:30,284 --> 00:54:32,680
(Their piece could be pushed away. They must stay focused.)

1547
00:54:32,686 --> 00:54:33,950
- A Ra. - Let's go.

1548
00:54:33,954 --> 00:54:36,220
(Next is A Ra from Team King Il Woo.)

1549
00:54:36,223 --> 00:54:39,285
- Start. - I know

1550
00:54:40,727 --> 00:54:42,985
I know

1551
00:54:44,064 --> 00:54:45,130
(It pushes Il Woo's piece to rolled omelet.)

1552
00:54:45,132 --> 00:54:46,260
Soy sauce?

1553
00:54:46,266 --> 00:54:47,330
It landed on rolled omelet.

1554
00:54:47,334 --> 00:54:49,260
(Hers pushes Il Woo's piece to rolled omelet.)

1555
00:54:49,269 --> 00:54:51,430
- It landed on rolled omelet. - It's on rolled omelet.

1556
00:54:51,438 --> 00:54:52,930
- It's on rolled omelet. - A Ra.

1557
00:54:52,939 --> 00:54:55,940
- You pushed it. - She pushed it on purpose.

1558
00:54:55,942 --> 00:54:57,110
Next is Hoon.

1559
00:54:57,110 --> 00:54:58,370
(Hoon from Team King Seok Jin starts.)

1560
00:54:58,378 --> 00:55:00,540
- Hoon. - You can push the other piece.

1561
00:55:00,547 --> 00:55:01,910
That's not a bad tactic.

1562
00:55:01,915 --> 00:55:04,650
Soup or spicy stir-fried pork sounds good.

1563
00:55:04,651 --> 00:55:06,450
Soup or spicy stir-fried pork?

1564
00:55:06,453 --> 00:55:07,750
(Okay, he got it.)

1565
00:55:07,754 --> 00:55:10,590
(I'll give it a try.)

1566
00:55:10,590 --> 00:55:14,355
(His fingers used to handle knives.)

1567
00:55:14,594 --> 00:55:16,285
(Flicking)

1568
00:55:16,897 --> 00:55:19,560
(It lands on soy sauce.)

1569
00:55:19,566 --> 00:55:21,560
(It's far from spicy stir-fried pork.)

1570
00:55:21,568 --> 00:55:22,900
(It doesn't even go near soup.)

1571
00:55:22,903 --> 00:55:25,500
- No, it's soy sauce. - Soy sauce?

1572
00:55:25,505 --> 00:55:26,840
- My goodness. - It's soy sauce.

1573
00:55:26,840 --> 00:55:28,070
We should do it from here.

1574
00:55:28,075 --> 00:55:30,270
Is this it? I know how it feels now.

1575
00:55:30,277 --> 00:55:31,910
Why did you do that?

1576
00:55:31,912 --> 00:55:34,140
- Go, So Min. - Someone has to play.

1577
00:55:34,147 --> 00:55:35,180
- So Min. - We need to score.

1578
00:55:35,182 --> 00:55:36,280
It should go this way.

1579
00:55:36,283 --> 00:55:38,580
It might land on stir-fried sausage if you don't do it well.

1580
00:55:38,585 --> 00:55:40,950
Push it this way. Be careful on this side.

1581
00:55:40,954 --> 00:55:43,220
Do you have to put your bottom so close?

1582
00:55:43,223 --> 00:55:44,690
(Moving about)

1583
00:55:44,691 --> 00:55:46,960
(His bottom bothers him.)

1584
00:55:46,960 --> 00:55:48,520
- Listen. - Sit down.

1585
00:55:48,528 --> 00:55:50,290
My goodness.

1586
00:55:50,297 --> 00:55:51,885
Start.

1587
00:55:52,332 --> 00:55:54,225
I hope it doesn't fall off.

1588
00:55:54,334 --> 00:55:56,930
(For now, )

1589
00:55:56,937 --> 00:55:59,865
(she throws it.)

1590
00:55:59,973 --> 00:56:06,140
(It passes between the pieces in the front.)

1591
00:56:06,146 --> 00:56:09,675
(It lands on braised short ribs.)

1592
00:56:12,819 --> 00:56:15,520
(Is it really braised short ribs?)

1593
00:56:15,522 --> 00:56:16,520
(King So Min does it.)

1594
00:56:16,523 --> 00:56:18,415
Yes!

1595
00:56:19,860 --> 00:56:23,285
(They admit her success.)

1596
00:56:23,296 --> 00:56:25,490
She's our king.

1597
00:56:25,499 --> 00:56:28,260
So Min, So Min.

1598
00:56:28,268 --> 00:56:30,800
- So Min. - So Min.

1599
00:56:30,804 --> 00:56:32,465
She's our king after all.

1600
00:56:33,106 --> 00:56:35,865
- She did it. - That was amazing.

1601
00:56:35,976 --> 00:56:38,135
So Min is the real king.

1602
00:56:38,445 --> 00:56:39,540
Hit braised short ribs.

1603
00:56:39,546 --> 00:56:41,880
If she pushes off our piece, that would be incredible.

1604
00:56:41,882 --> 00:56:43,040
(Flicking)

1605
00:56:43,049 --> 00:56:44,050
Vegetable wraps are good too.

1606
00:56:44,050 --> 00:56:46,050
It's zero points. That's good.

1607
00:56:46,052 --> 00:56:47,845
Here's a pretender.

1608
00:56:47,954 --> 00:56:49,250
(He eliminates Ji Hyo's piece.)

1609
00:56:49,256 --> 00:56:50,320
What?

1610
00:56:50,323 --> 00:56:51,990
Did we lose vegetable wraps?

1611
00:56:51,992 --> 00:56:53,790
- Kwang Soo. - What?

1612
00:56:53,794 --> 00:56:55,890
(Is he giving the last chance to Kwang Soo?)

1613
00:56:55,896 --> 00:56:58,390
Don't lose our braised short ribs.

1614
00:56:58,398 --> 00:57:00,130
What if Kwang Soo pushes off our stir-fried sausage?

1615
00:57:00,133 --> 00:57:01,430
- Kwang Soo. - He might hit it.

1616
00:57:01,435 --> 00:57:04,000
- What if he creates a mess? - What mess?

1617
00:57:04,004 --> 00:57:05,100
Don't create any mess.

1618
00:57:05,105 --> 00:57:06,870
Can you do it? This time...

1619
00:57:06,873 --> 00:57:08,870
- Go for spicy stir-fried pork. - Let's go for that.

1620
00:57:08,875 --> 00:57:10,610
- How about something else? - Soup is good too.

1621
00:57:10,610 --> 00:57:12,040
- Get rolled omelet. - Right.

1622
00:57:12,045 --> 00:57:13,480
Okay? Don't be greedy.

1623
00:57:13,480 --> 00:57:15,810
We don't expect you to get something like ribs, okay?

1624
00:57:15,816 --> 00:57:17,975
We'll kick you out if you fail.

1625
00:57:18,318 --> 00:57:19,350
Here's Kwang Soo.

1626
00:57:19,352 --> 00:57:21,175
(But that's not how people think.)

1627
00:57:21,321 --> 00:57:22,520
I think he's looking at braised short ribs.

1628
00:57:22,522 --> 00:57:24,220
Don't. No.

1629
00:57:24,224 --> 00:57:26,620
- Don't go for it. - Seriously don't.

1630
00:57:26,626 --> 00:57:28,090
Leave it.

1631
00:57:28,094 --> 00:57:29,990
(Will Kwang Soo take the safe route?)

1632
00:57:29,996 --> 00:57:31,755
(Flicking)

1633
00:57:32,532 --> 00:57:34,725
(Is he going to blow the chance away?)

1634
00:57:35,669 --> 00:57:36,670
What?

1635
00:57:36,670 --> 00:57:39,670
(He didn't even reach "soy sauce".)

1636
00:57:39,673 --> 00:57:42,140
What did you just do?

1637
00:57:42,142 --> 00:57:44,040
- Are you a spy? - Kwang Soo.

1638
00:57:44,044 --> 00:57:45,270
Move.

1639
00:57:45,278 --> 00:57:48,540
- Is this why we accepted you? - I got too nervous.

1640
00:57:48,548 --> 00:57:50,075
Move.

1641
00:57:50,083 --> 00:57:52,050
- It's nothing. - "Move".

1642
00:57:52,052 --> 00:57:54,315
- "Move". - He blew it.

1643
00:57:54,554 --> 00:57:57,090
What should I do?

1644
00:57:57,090 --> 00:57:59,290
("Rolled omelet" and "soy sauce" are taken.)

1645
00:57:59,292 --> 00:58:01,585
You have to flick it far.

1646
00:58:01,728 --> 00:58:03,160
You can do it.

1647
00:58:03,163 --> 00:58:04,785
- Start. - Good luck.

1648
00:58:05,332 --> 00:58:07,425
(Flicking)

1649
00:58:08,335 --> 00:58:11,570
(It goes far.)

1650
00:58:11,571 --> 00:58:13,670
- Okay! - That was too strong.

1651
00:58:13,673 --> 00:58:15,100
(He went out.)

1652
00:58:15,108 --> 00:58:17,540
That was too strong. That went straight out.

1653
00:58:17,544 --> 00:58:19,640
Do you want to go? You go.

1654
00:58:19,646 --> 00:58:21,540
- Hoon. - He's...

1655
00:58:21,548 --> 00:58:24,580
- athletic. - Hoon,

1656
00:58:24,584 --> 00:58:25,910
(Listen to me.)

1657
00:58:25,919 --> 00:58:28,550
come in the middle and hit this.

1658
00:58:28,555 --> 00:58:30,450
- You can land on short ribs. - Should I do that?

1659
00:58:30,457 --> 00:58:32,220
Yes, come in the middle.

1660
00:58:32,225 --> 00:58:33,620
That would be insane.

1661
00:58:33,627 --> 00:58:35,760
- Come in the middle. - Stir-fried sausage is in the way.

1662
00:58:35,762 --> 00:58:38,160
- It's right here. - Hit it.

1663
00:58:38,164 --> 00:58:40,155
(This is their last chance. Can he do it?)

1664
00:58:44,404 --> 00:58:47,695
(He went in the middle!)

1665
00:58:50,744 --> 00:58:53,140
(If he keeps on going...)

1666
00:58:53,146 --> 00:58:58,580
(He hit So Min's piece!)

1667
00:58:58,585 --> 00:59:04,350
(If So Min's piece falls off, the game will turn around.)

1668
00:59:04,357 --> 00:59:05,450
(It stops on the edge.)

1669
00:59:05,458 --> 00:59:07,020
You did it!

1670
00:59:07,027 --> 00:59:09,060
(How is this possible?)

1671
00:59:09,062 --> 00:59:10,990
- We did it! - Oh, my.

1672
00:59:10,997 --> 00:59:12,130
(They almost did it!)

1673
00:59:12,132 --> 00:59:15,330
(Hoon played as Seok Jin instructed.)

1674
00:59:15,335 --> 00:59:17,200
- He did it. - He almost took her out.

1675
00:59:17,203 --> 00:59:19,100
- We did it! - Oh, my.

1676
00:59:19,105 --> 00:59:22,365
Oh, my. Hoon.

1677
00:59:22,709 --> 00:59:23,710
You did it.

1678
00:59:23,710 --> 00:59:26,410
(He didn't take her out but he landed on short ribs.)

1679
00:59:26,413 --> 00:59:28,375
He was saved because of me.

1680
00:59:28,381 --> 00:59:29,810
That's right. He was saved because of So Min.

1681
00:59:29,816 --> 00:59:31,180
He was saved because of me.

1682
00:59:31,184 --> 00:59:33,750
If it weren't for hers, it would have gone out.

1683
00:59:33,753 --> 00:59:35,180
This is unbelievable.

1684
00:59:35,188 --> 00:59:37,850
The winner is Team King So Min.

1685
00:59:37,857 --> 00:59:41,520
- King! She's our king. - I'm the king.

1686
00:59:41,528 --> 00:59:42,520
I'm the king.

1687
00:59:42,529 --> 00:59:45,525
A fake king dominates the world.

1688
00:59:45,532 --> 00:59:47,630
(That was so close!)

1689
00:59:47,634 --> 00:59:49,000
What's the hint?

1690
00:59:49,002 --> 00:59:50,430
(She obtains a hint, treason right, and recruitment right.)

1691
00:59:50,437 --> 00:59:51,770
You get too many things.

1692
00:59:51,771 --> 00:59:53,470
The hint is too good.

1693
00:59:53,473 --> 00:59:56,465
(They took another hint.)

1694
00:59:57,143 --> 00:59:58,440
Read it out loud.

1695
00:59:58,445 --> 01:00:04,010
(What is the hint about their king?)

1696
01:00:04,017 --> 01:00:06,345
"The real king lacks honor..."

1697
01:00:06,586 --> 01:00:08,250
He lacks it.

1698
01:00:08,254 --> 01:00:10,420
(Hold on.)

1699
01:00:10,423 --> 01:00:13,120
(The hint states...)

1700
01:00:13,126 --> 01:00:15,460
("The real king lacks honor but he has a developed nose...)

1701
01:00:15,462 --> 01:00:18,055
(which represents wealth, so he hesitates between wealth and fame.")

1702
01:00:18,365 --> 01:00:19,660
Hold on.

1703
01:00:19,666 --> 01:00:20,660
(He has a developed nose?)

1704
01:00:20,667 --> 01:00:23,325
Il Woo, can you look at us?

1705
01:00:23,670 --> 01:00:26,700
(Who has...)

1706
01:00:26,706 --> 01:00:28,500
Is it him?

1707
01:00:28,508 --> 01:00:31,465
(Who has the king's nose?)

1708
01:00:31,745 --> 01:00:34,040
- Do you agree? - Come. I'll explain.

1709
01:00:34,047 --> 01:00:35,110
- Hold on. - I'll explain.

1710
01:00:35,115 --> 01:00:36,650
The nation is being shaken.

1711
01:00:36,650 --> 01:00:39,250
(The nation is being shaken.)

1712
01:00:39,252 --> 01:00:41,050
- It's being shaken. - It's being shaken by the roots.

1713
01:00:41,054 --> 01:00:43,815
- My goodness. - It's starting to shake.

1714
01:00:44,524 --> 01:00:45,720
This one is good.

1715
01:00:45,725 --> 01:00:48,115
- This one is... - I'm curious.

1716
01:00:48,395 --> 01:00:50,360
I'm curious.

1717
01:00:50,363 --> 01:00:53,430
(What will happen to the three kings?)

1718
01:00:53,433 --> 01:00:57,665
(Team King So Min recruits Hoon.)

1719
01:00:57,937 --> 01:01:00,570
Can you not figure it out?

1720
01:01:00,573 --> 01:01:02,640
Our hint was too confusing.

1721
01:01:02,642 --> 01:01:04,140
- That was. - I know.

1722
01:01:04,144 --> 01:01:06,270
- Was it confusing? - The hint...

1723
01:01:06,279 --> 01:01:09,140
We were certain after the 1st hint. We're not sure about the 2nd one.

1724
01:01:09,149 --> 01:01:10,910
- How was it? - The 2nd hint...

1725
01:01:10,917 --> 01:01:12,350
How was the hint?

1726
01:01:12,352 --> 01:01:15,080
- It confused us. - It confused me.

1727
01:01:15,088 --> 01:01:16,450
What's it about?

1728
01:01:16,456 --> 01:01:18,690
- I convinced them. - We can't say.

1729
01:01:18,692 --> 01:01:22,285
- They won't say. - I'm certain.

1730
01:01:22,395 --> 01:01:24,360
(There's one nation that looks especially weak.)

1731
01:01:24,364 --> 01:01:27,160
- Excuse me. - Our kingdom is falling apart.

1732
01:01:27,167 --> 01:01:28,630
Are you guys the class president and the vice-president?

1733
01:01:28,635 --> 01:01:31,065
(Are you guys the class president and the vice-president?)

1734
01:01:31,304 --> 01:01:32,500
We're a kingdom.

1735
01:01:32,505 --> 01:01:33,570
I thought you were accepting money...

1736
01:01:33,573 --> 01:01:35,065
- at a wedding. - We're a kingdom.

1737
01:01:35,108 --> 01:01:36,870
What's wrong with this nation?

1738
01:01:36,876 --> 01:01:39,640
- There's an old man and just me. - My goodness.

1739
01:01:39,646 --> 01:01:42,380
This is the last mission...

1740
01:01:42,382 --> 01:01:44,750
where you can switch the members and check the identity...

1741
01:01:44,751 --> 01:01:46,080
of the real king.

1742
01:01:46,086 --> 01:01:47,915
This is the last mission.

1743
01:01:47,954 --> 01:01:49,720
It's The King's Tears.

1744
01:01:49,723 --> 01:01:51,190
"The King's Tears".

1745
01:01:51,191 --> 01:01:53,020
- What's this? - "The King's Tears".

1746
01:01:53,026 --> 01:01:55,355
I want to cry.

1747
01:01:57,363 --> 01:02:01,225
If one of the kings gets the answer,

1748
01:02:01,534 --> 01:02:04,670
they have to remove a stick from a member's cap...

1749
01:02:04,671 --> 01:02:06,770
and if the water falls, they can recruit that member.

1750
01:02:06,773 --> 01:02:08,670
- If the water falls? - It has to fall.

1751
01:02:08,675 --> 01:02:10,740
- I get what it is. - The water has to fall.

1752
01:02:10,744 --> 01:02:12,805
If a civilian gets the answer,

1753
01:02:13,146 --> 01:02:15,140
they can pick two kings...

1754
01:02:15,148 --> 01:02:18,045
and find out if the real king is one of them.

1755
01:02:18,251 --> 01:02:19,350
You're going to tell them?

1756
01:02:19,352 --> 01:02:21,245
(The civilian can pick two kings and find out who they are.)

1757
01:02:22,322 --> 01:02:24,745
- You're going to tell them? - Really?

1758
01:02:25,024 --> 01:02:26,590
Whether the king is there or not?

1759
01:02:26,593 --> 01:02:28,190
- Great. - That's good.

1760
01:02:28,194 --> 01:02:31,060
When So Min heard that, she laughed really hard.

1761
01:02:31,064 --> 01:02:33,390
(Hold on.)

1762
01:02:33,399 --> 01:02:35,700
I was happy. I'm the king.

1763
01:02:35,702 --> 01:02:38,070
I'm the king, Jong Kook. I'm certain.

1764
01:02:38,071 --> 01:02:40,470
- We'll know right away. - That's great.

1765
01:02:40,473 --> 01:02:43,340
However, the member can only be switched...

1766
01:02:43,343 --> 01:02:45,710
only the king removes the stick...

1767
01:02:45,712 --> 01:02:49,080
and the water falls on them.

1768
01:02:49,082 --> 01:02:51,250
- This is difficult. - We have to do well.

1769
01:02:51,251 --> 01:02:54,350
Their civilians are getting ready to escape.

1770
01:02:54,354 --> 01:02:56,950
(Why is that?)

1771
01:02:56,956 --> 01:02:58,520
What are you talking about?

1772
01:02:58,525 --> 01:02:59,850
Don't be mistaken.

1773
01:02:59,859 --> 01:03:02,290
They're just not telling us.

1774
01:03:02,295 --> 01:03:04,660
- They're getting ready to escape. - What are you talking about?

1775
01:03:04,664 --> 01:03:06,900
- This is So Min's demise. - I think I'm right.

1776
01:03:06,900 --> 01:03:08,500
What do you mean?

1777
01:03:08,501 --> 01:03:10,100
I think it'll be her demise at the end.

1778
01:03:10,103 --> 01:03:11,995
I'll serve you until the end.

1779
01:03:12,172 --> 01:03:13,670
Bring the table in.

1780
01:03:13,673 --> 01:03:14,670
(There are 5 sticks on the cap.)

1781
01:03:14,674 --> 01:03:15,940
Do we put them on?

1782
01:03:15,942 --> 01:03:17,370
(They need to remove the number of sticks as designated.)

1783
01:03:17,377 --> 01:03:18,865
Put it on.

1784
01:03:19,245 --> 01:03:21,540
I'm worried about this.

1785
01:03:21,548 --> 01:03:25,280
The theme of today's quiz is "king".

1786
01:03:25,285 --> 01:03:27,950
- "King". All right. - Okay.

1787
01:03:27,954 --> 01:03:30,620
Haha, let's build our kingdom. This won't do.

1788
01:03:30,623 --> 01:03:33,520
Here's the first question.

1789
01:03:33,526 --> 01:03:36,460
- There are two sticks involved. - Good.

1790
01:03:36,462 --> 01:03:38,160
You pick two sticks.

1791
01:03:38,164 --> 01:03:41,030
"Who is referred to..."

1792
01:03:41,034 --> 01:03:42,400
"as the King of Song?"

1793
01:03:42,402 --> 01:03:44,800
- "The King of Song". - "The King of Song"?

1794
01:03:44,804 --> 01:03:48,935
One, Franz Peter Schubert.

1795
01:03:49,709 --> 01:03:53,635
Two, Ludwig van Beethoven.

1796
01:03:53,813 --> 01:03:58,075
Three, Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart.

1797
01:03:58,151 --> 01:04:01,345
Four, Antonio Vivaldi.

1798
01:04:01,688 --> 01:04:04,020
- Answer. - Four.

1799
01:04:04,023 --> 01:04:05,790
Antonio Vivaldi.

1800
01:04:05,792 --> 01:04:07,860
Answer.

1801
01:04:07,861 --> 01:04:10,955
Four, Wolfgang Amadeus Vivaldi.

1802
01:04:11,231 --> 01:04:14,525
- What? - What are you talking about?

1803
01:04:14,567 --> 01:04:15,700
What are you talking about?

1804
01:04:15,702 --> 01:04:17,670
- No? - What was that?

1805
01:04:17,670 --> 01:04:20,265
- Answer. One, - Wasn't I right?

1806
01:04:20,673 --> 01:04:23,200
Wolfgang Tereus...

1807
01:04:23,209 --> 01:04:24,470
(Incorrect)

1808
01:04:24,477 --> 01:04:25,610
It's hard to memorize.

1809
01:04:25,612 --> 01:04:27,740
We have to memorize it.

1810
01:04:27,747 --> 01:04:30,175
Answer! One,

1811
01:04:30,316 --> 01:04:33,450
Franz Peteru Schubert.

1812
01:04:33,453 --> 01:04:34,820
Can you say it again?

1813
01:04:34,821 --> 01:04:37,120
Franz Peteru Schubert.

1814
01:04:37,123 --> 01:04:38,350
Answer!

1815
01:04:38,358 --> 01:04:40,020
(That was close.)

1816
01:04:40,026 --> 01:04:42,085
Answer.

1817
01:04:43,129 --> 01:04:45,060
- Frunch? - What?

1818
01:04:45,064 --> 01:04:46,530
He said "brunch".

1819
01:04:46,532 --> 01:04:48,400
- Answer! - Answer!

1820
01:04:48,401 --> 01:04:51,065
- Answer. - Ji Hyo.

1821
01:04:51,170 --> 01:04:52,825
Frenz?

1822
01:04:52,972 --> 01:04:54,870
Answer!

1823
01:04:54,874 --> 01:04:56,140
(It's King So Min's turn.)

1824
01:04:56,142 --> 01:04:58,840
One, Franz Peter Schubert.

1825
01:04:58,845 --> 01:05:00,535
(She pronounces it accurately.)

1826
01:05:01,281 --> 01:05:04,780
(She got the name right, but is it 1?)

1827
01:05:04,784 --> 01:05:07,350
(Who is referred to as the King of Song?)

1828
01:05:07,353 --> 01:05:08,650
We tried everything.

1829
01:05:08,655 --> 01:05:10,850
(She's correct.)

1830
01:05:10,857 --> 01:05:12,450
(He was an Austrian composer known for "Trout Quintet".)

1831
01:05:12,458 --> 01:05:15,790
I know he's the King of Song. Goodness.

1832
01:05:15,795 --> 01:05:17,160
- This is the day. - Let's grow...

1833
01:05:17,163 --> 01:05:20,500
- You're indeed the King. - Let's grow the kingdom, everybody.

1834
01:05:20,500 --> 01:05:22,060
I can't bow.

1835
01:05:22,068 --> 01:05:25,970
King, you should save a civilian from there.

1836
01:05:25,972 --> 01:05:29,040
There's only one here. Go there.

1837
01:05:29,042 --> 01:05:31,135
- Yes? - Take two sticks out.

1838
01:05:31,444 --> 01:05:33,810
Kwang Soo, this is your job.

1839
01:05:33,813 --> 01:05:36,640
- Take two out. - Why would you take my civilian?

1840
01:05:36,649 --> 01:05:38,250
- You're usually unlucky. - Okay.

1841
01:05:38,251 --> 01:05:40,080
Take one out. You're unlucky.

1842
01:05:40,086 --> 01:05:42,050
It's too lonely here.

1843
01:05:42,055 --> 01:05:43,120
Take one out.

1844
01:05:43,122 --> 01:05:44,850
Please.

1845
01:05:44,857 --> 01:05:46,090
Please work.

1846
01:05:46,092 --> 01:05:48,990
(What will happen to Civilian Haha?)

1847
01:05:48,995 --> 01:05:51,390
(He removes the first stick.)

1848
01:05:51,397 --> 01:05:52,790
Please.

1849
01:05:52,799 --> 01:05:56,155
(Please don't let water come out.)

1850
01:05:56,269 --> 01:05:58,595
- It didn't come out. - It's coming out.

1851
01:05:59,272 --> 01:06:00,470
(Dripping)

1852
01:06:00,473 --> 01:06:02,100
- It's coming out. - It came out.

1853
01:06:02,108 --> 01:06:04,740
- Yes! - I knew it.

1854
01:06:04,744 --> 01:06:06,640
(Welcome to Team King So Min.)

1855
01:06:06,646 --> 01:06:08,540
It's freedom!

1856
01:06:08,548 --> 01:06:09,810
(Thanks to Kwang Soo, Haha enters Team King So Min.)

1857
01:06:09,816 --> 01:06:13,005
- This kingdom is done. - What's going on?

1858
01:06:13,086 --> 01:06:15,350
The real king is alive.

1859
01:06:15,355 --> 01:06:17,015
You're on your own.

1860
01:06:17,023 --> 01:06:19,220
Isn't that nation done?

1861
01:06:19,225 --> 01:06:21,620
- I know. It is. - This is driving me nuts.

1862
01:06:21,627 --> 01:06:22,890
(Team King So Min has 6 civilians now.)

1863
01:06:22,895 --> 01:06:25,460
My nation is prosperous.

1864
01:06:25,465 --> 01:06:27,560
- I can't even take over. - We're in trouble.

1865
01:06:27,567 --> 01:06:30,000
Here's the second question.

1866
01:06:30,003 --> 01:06:32,300
- Second question. - This is not difficult.

1867
01:06:32,305 --> 01:06:35,665
There are two sticks assigned to this question too.

1868
01:06:35,942 --> 01:06:38,270
"Which actor didn't play..."

1869
01:06:38,277 --> 01:06:39,740
"the role of a king?"

1870
01:06:39,746 --> 01:06:41,810
- I watch many dramas, - All right.

1871
01:06:41,814 --> 01:06:43,635
so I know for sure.

1872
01:06:43,683 --> 01:06:47,680
One, Han Seok Kyu from "Deep Rooted Tree".

1873
01:06:47,687 --> 01:06:48,920
(Which actor didn't play the role of a king?)

1874
01:06:48,921 --> 01:06:53,515
Two, Jung Tae Woo from "Ladies of the Palace".

1875
01:06:53,526 --> 01:06:55,520
- What? - Three,

1876
01:06:55,528 --> 01:06:59,055
Yoo Dong Kun from "Daejoyoung".

1877
01:06:59,065 --> 01:07:03,730
Four, Ji Jin Hee from "The Great Seer".

1878
01:07:03,736 --> 01:07:05,100
- Answer. - Answer.

1879
01:07:05,104 --> 01:07:06,730
(It's King Il Woo's turn.)

1880
01:07:06,739 --> 01:07:09,170
Four, Ji Jin Hee from "The Great Seer".

1881
01:07:09,175 --> 01:07:10,540
Answer!

1882
01:07:10,543 --> 01:07:13,765
(His eyes shake.)

1883
01:07:13,846 --> 01:07:16,075
Answer!

1884
01:07:16,315 --> 01:07:19,605
Yoo Dong Kun from "Daejoyoung".

1885
01:07:19,852 --> 01:07:21,050
- What number? - Three.

1886
01:07:21,054 --> 01:07:22,380
(Which actor didn't play the role of a king?)

1887
01:07:22,388 --> 01:07:24,045
All right!

1888
01:07:24,724 --> 01:07:25,720
All right!

1889
01:07:25,725 --> 01:07:27,360
(Choi Su Jong played the king in "Daejoyoung".)

1890
01:07:27,360 --> 01:07:29,220
We're killing it today.

1891
01:07:29,228 --> 01:07:30,590
Oh, well.

1892
01:07:30,596 --> 01:07:31,760
I get to..

1893
01:07:31,764 --> 01:07:33,760
find out who the king is.

1894
01:07:33,766 --> 01:07:35,360
I can pick two.

1895
01:07:35,368 --> 01:07:37,500
That's right. That's the hint you get.

1896
01:07:37,503 --> 01:07:39,065
Please check.

1897
01:07:39,772 --> 01:07:41,570
Try Seok Jin.

1898
01:07:41,574 --> 01:07:44,070
(Which two kings does he want to know about?)

1899
01:07:44,077 --> 01:07:46,635
- Do I pick two? - Yes, go ahead.

1900
01:07:48,781 --> 01:07:52,850
(King Seok Jin insists he's the one.)

1901
01:07:52,852 --> 01:07:57,520
(King So Min has the most number of civilians.)

1902
01:07:57,523 --> 01:08:02,215
(King Il Woo is keeping quiet and looking for his chance.)

1903
01:08:05,865 --> 01:08:07,955
Seok Jin and Il Woo.

1904
01:08:09,802 --> 01:08:14,465
(Is one of them the real king?)

1905
01:08:15,241 --> 01:08:16,400
(The real king is...)

1906
01:08:16,409 --> 01:08:18,070
- Only Jae Seok gets to know. - One of them...

1907
01:08:18,077 --> 01:08:19,270
is the real king.

1908
01:08:19,278 --> 01:08:22,505
(The real king is either Seok Jin or Il Woo.)

1909
01:08:24,584 --> 01:08:26,250
(Really?)

1910
01:08:26,252 --> 01:08:27,520
Really?

1911
01:08:27,520 --> 01:08:29,245
- He's shocked. - Really?

1912
01:08:29,322 --> 01:08:30,490
He's shocked.

1913
01:08:30,490 --> 01:08:31,690
- There is? - Yes.

1914
01:08:31,691 --> 01:08:35,390
(If the real king is either Seok Jin or Il Woo, )

1915
01:08:35,394 --> 01:08:40,055
(So Min isn't the king.)

1916
01:08:40,133 --> 01:08:43,930
(Who's the real king then?)

1917
01:08:43,936 --> 01:08:45,630
- Why? - He's shocked.

1918
01:08:45,638 --> 01:08:48,070
(Why is he so shocked?)

1919
01:08:48,074 --> 01:08:51,070
If you want to switch to another team,

1920
01:08:51,077 --> 01:08:53,570
you can take two sticks out from another member's cap.

1921
01:08:53,579 --> 01:08:56,205
Jae Seok, come here.

1922
01:08:56,649 --> 01:08:58,480
I'm the real king.

1923
01:08:58,484 --> 01:09:02,320
(The real one usually stays quiet.)

1924
01:09:02,321 --> 01:09:04,685
- Goodness. - Jae Seok.

1925
01:09:04,924 --> 01:09:07,485
Your decision is very important right now.

1926
01:09:07,727 --> 01:09:10,260
But he has the treason right.

1927
01:09:10,263 --> 01:09:12,060
This doesn't mean anything to him.

1928
01:09:12,064 --> 01:09:14,060
- He can use it at the end. - He has treason right.

1929
01:09:14,066 --> 01:09:15,460
Should I go here?

1930
01:09:15,468 --> 01:09:16,900
(Then!)

1931
01:09:16,903 --> 01:09:18,370
(He picks King Seok Jin who looks easy.)

1932
01:09:18,371 --> 01:09:20,725
- It could be me, right? - Well.

1933
01:09:20,773 --> 01:09:23,595
If the water falls, then it'll be funny.

1934
01:09:23,910 --> 01:09:25,240
Two?

1935
01:09:25,244 --> 01:09:27,010
- Please fall. - You might not switch.

1936
01:09:27,013 --> 01:09:28,440
Hey.

1937
01:09:28,447 --> 01:09:30,275
Hold on to my head.

1938
01:09:30,316 --> 01:09:32,280
(The first stick is a fail.)

1939
01:09:32,285 --> 01:09:34,680
- Should I hold on to your head? - Your head?

1940
01:09:34,687 --> 01:09:36,180
- I'm sorry. - What do you mean?

1941
01:09:36,189 --> 01:09:37,320
- Hold on the helmet. - No, hold on to this.

1942
01:09:37,323 --> 01:09:38,650
You can hold on to it.

1943
01:09:38,658 --> 01:09:40,090
- That's true. - Right.

1944
01:09:40,092 --> 01:09:42,520
If no water comes out, then nothing changes.

1945
01:09:42,528 --> 01:09:43,760
- Nothing changes. - There's no water.

1946
01:09:43,763 --> 01:09:44,890
(The second stick is a fail too.)

1947
01:09:44,897 --> 01:09:46,230
You're usually good at this.

1948
01:09:46,232 --> 01:09:47,830
Nothing came out.

1949
01:09:47,833 --> 01:09:50,100
Jae Seok, you looked sad.

1950
01:09:50,102 --> 01:09:51,925
No way.

1951
01:09:52,438 --> 01:09:53,470
But...

1952
01:09:53,472 --> 01:09:55,095
(He's speechless.)

1953
01:09:55,942 --> 01:09:57,100
(Other civilians don't know what's going on.)

1954
01:09:57,109 --> 01:09:58,240
(They don't have the hint.)

1955
01:09:58,244 --> 01:10:00,335
I have no idea.

1956
01:10:01,314 --> 01:10:03,375
- Here we go. - Okay.

1957
01:10:03,382 --> 01:10:04,580
This is a short-answer question.

1958
01:10:04,584 --> 01:10:06,350
There are three sticks assigned to it.

1959
01:10:06,352 --> 01:10:08,345
I have to get this right.

1960
01:10:08,354 --> 01:10:10,845
- "In five seconds," - Oh, dear.

1961
01:10:10,856 --> 01:10:13,690
"name five movie titles that has "king" in them."

1962
01:10:13,693 --> 01:10:15,185
Answer.

1963
01:10:15,361 --> 01:10:17,390
"The King's Tears", "King and the Clown", "King's Lady",

1964
01:10:17,396 --> 01:10:19,925
Joey Wong's "A Chinese Ghost Story"...

1965
01:10:20,266 --> 01:10:21,530
Isn't it "Tears of the Dragon"?

1966
01:10:21,534 --> 01:10:22,930
(He only got "King and the Clown" right.)

1967
01:10:22,935 --> 01:10:24,630
Does Joey Wong count?

1968
01:10:24,637 --> 01:10:26,195
(What has "king" in it?)

1969
01:10:26,539 --> 01:10:27,540
Answer!

1970
01:10:27,540 --> 01:10:28,670
(It's Yul's turn.)

1971
01:10:28,674 --> 01:10:30,240
"King and the Clown", "The Foul King",

1972
01:10:30,243 --> 01:10:31,770
"Queen of Walking",

1973
01:10:31,777 --> 01:10:33,010
"King Arthur",

1974
01:10:33,012 --> 01:10:34,140
and "I am the King".

1975
01:10:34,146 --> 01:10:35,480
(Time over)

1976
01:10:35,481 --> 01:10:36,510
- Answer! - Answer.

1977
01:10:36,515 --> 01:10:38,280
(It's about who takes it first now.)

1978
01:10:38,284 --> 01:10:40,280
"I am the King", "The Foul King",

1979
01:10:40,286 --> 01:10:41,880
"Queen of Walking", "The King of Jokgu",

1980
01:10:41,887 --> 01:10:43,050
and "The King".

1981
01:10:43,055 --> 01:10:44,650
(He's correct!)

1982
01:10:44,657 --> 01:10:45,820
"Queen of Walking"?

1983
01:10:45,825 --> 01:10:47,390
- Is there "Queen of Walking"? - There is.

1984
01:10:47,393 --> 01:10:49,020
- There's a movie. - There's "Queen of Walking".

1985
01:10:49,028 --> 01:10:50,590
- Shim Eun Kyung is in it. - Right.

1986
01:10:50,596 --> 01:10:52,555
- Can I ask? - Go ahead.

1987
01:10:52,932 --> 01:10:53,960
Kwang Soo.

1988
01:10:53,966 --> 01:10:56,025
(Kwang Soo got the question right, so he gets to ask who the king is.)

1989
01:10:56,535 --> 01:10:58,095
Seok Jin...

1990
01:10:59,238 --> 01:11:00,765
and Il Woo.

1991
01:11:02,174 --> 01:11:05,105
(The pretender is anxious.)

1992
01:11:05,244 --> 01:11:07,640
One of them is the real king.

1993
01:11:07,647 --> 01:11:11,080
(The real king is either Seok Jin or Il Woo.)

1994
01:11:11,083 --> 01:11:12,380
(It's not So Min?)

1995
01:11:12,385 --> 01:11:13,850
He looks shocked.

1996
01:11:13,853 --> 01:11:15,320
(He reacts the same way as Jae Seok.)

1997
01:11:15,321 --> 01:11:18,045
Kwang Soo. You look shocked.

1998
01:11:18,424 --> 01:11:20,390
- Kwang Soo. - I was shocked too.

1999
01:11:20,393 --> 01:11:22,090
- He's shocked. - He's really shocked.

2000
01:11:22,094 --> 01:11:23,220
I was shocked too.

2001
01:11:23,229 --> 01:11:24,390
He's really shocked.

2002
01:11:24,397 --> 01:11:26,185
(It's either Seok Jin or Il Woo.)

2003
01:11:26,565 --> 01:11:28,560
(Kwang Soo's reasoning)

2004
01:11:28,567 --> 01:11:29,560
I knew it!

2005
01:11:29,568 --> 01:11:30,700
(The second hint stated that he has a developed nose.)

2006
01:11:30,703 --> 01:11:31,730
(Jae Seok picked Seok Jin as well.)

2007
01:11:31,737 --> 01:11:32,930
(That means...)

2008
01:11:32,938 --> 01:11:33,970
Really?

2009
01:11:33,973 --> 01:11:36,440
(Kwang Soo predicts the real king is...)

2010
01:11:36,442 --> 01:11:37,910
- Can I pick three? - Yes.

2011
01:11:37,910 --> 01:11:39,040
I pick Seok Jin!

2012
01:11:39,045 --> 01:11:42,305
(Seok Jin has a huge nose.)

2013
01:11:42,715 --> 01:11:44,450
(Will Seok Jin be the king...)

2014
01:11:44,450 --> 01:11:48,045
(as Kwang Soo predicted?)

2015
01:11:48,688 --> 01:11:50,420
(King Seok Jin has 3 sticks left.)

2016
01:11:50,423 --> 01:11:52,420
(Jae Seok removed 2.)

2017
01:11:52,425 --> 01:11:53,990
(He's so happy that he's flooded in tears.)

2018
01:11:53,993 --> 01:11:55,360
(He has a civilian.)

2019
01:11:55,361 --> 01:11:57,085
Do I get to escape?

2020
01:11:57,096 --> 01:11:58,360
(Kwang Soo heads to Team King Seok Jin.)

2021
01:11:58,364 --> 01:12:00,960
Kwang Soo escaped.

2022
01:12:00,966 --> 01:12:02,925
Goodness.

2023
01:12:03,302 --> 01:12:04,430
Come here.

2024
01:12:04,437 --> 01:12:06,530
(The civilians without any hints are confused.)

2025
01:12:06,539 --> 01:12:07,600
Everybody,

2026
01:12:07,606 --> 01:12:09,470
do you understand the flow now?

2027
01:12:09,475 --> 01:12:12,435
I'll save poor Civilian Kwang Soo.

2028
01:12:13,012 --> 01:12:15,210
- No. - Listen.

2029
01:12:15,214 --> 01:12:16,810
(There's no refusal.)

2030
01:12:16,816 --> 01:12:19,450
Civilians of Team King So Min,

2031
01:12:19,452 --> 01:12:21,950
bring Kwang Soo back.

2032
01:12:21,954 --> 01:12:23,420
(It's the king's will.)

2033
01:12:23,422 --> 01:12:25,420
- Yes, sir. - Yes, sir.

2034
01:12:25,424 --> 01:12:26,820
I don't know.

2035
01:12:26,826 --> 01:12:28,360
It might be So Min.

2036
01:12:28,361 --> 01:12:29,760
I'm not 100 percent sure.

2037
01:12:29,762 --> 01:12:31,760
- Make sure we bring him back. - Okay.

2038
01:12:31,764 --> 01:12:33,130
Here's the fourth question.

2039
01:12:33,132 --> 01:12:35,325
There are three sticks assigned to this as well.

2040
01:12:35,434 --> 01:12:37,230
This is a multiple question.

2041
01:12:37,236 --> 01:12:40,465
"What do you call a man..."

2042
01:12:40,573 --> 01:12:44,970
"who gains social status by marrying into a family of high status?"

2043
01:12:44,977 --> 01:12:46,340
A man?

2044
01:12:46,345 --> 01:12:48,710
One, Love Nobleman.

2045
01:12:48,714 --> 01:12:50,310
That's not it.

2046
01:12:50,316 --> 01:12:52,650
Two, Skirt Nobleman.

2047
01:12:52,651 --> 01:12:53,750
(They have to get a hint.)

2048
01:12:53,753 --> 01:12:56,545
Three, Government Post Nobleman.

2049
01:12:56,655 --> 01:12:58,420
Four, Outside Nobleman.

2050
01:12:58,424 --> 01:12:59,590
- Answer! - Answer!

2051
01:12:59,592 --> 01:13:00,690
(Se Chan tries for the first time.)

2052
01:13:00,693 --> 01:13:02,320
- Se Chan. - One, Love Nobleman.

2053
01:13:02,328 --> 01:13:04,155
Answer.

2054
01:13:04,163 --> 01:13:06,255
Two, Skirt Nobleman.

2055
01:13:06,565 --> 01:13:08,055
Two, Skirt Nobleman.

2056
01:13:08,367 --> 01:13:10,030
She's the king!

2057
01:13:10,035 --> 01:13:11,630
(Love Nobleman is the male head of the household.)

2058
01:13:11,637 --> 01:13:13,170
(Government Post Nobleman is a government official.)

2059
01:13:13,172 --> 01:13:16,970
Bring Kwang Soo back!

2060
01:13:16,976 --> 01:13:18,570
Hold on. Think about it.

2061
01:13:18,577 --> 01:13:19,840
Think about it.

2062
01:13:19,845 --> 01:13:21,210
Think about it carefully.

2063
01:13:21,213 --> 01:13:22,310
I...

2064
01:13:22,314 --> 01:13:23,710
This is so funny.

2065
01:13:23,716 --> 01:13:26,145
He comes right back.

2066
01:13:26,185 --> 01:13:27,850
Why are you doing this to me?

2067
01:13:27,853 --> 01:13:28,850
Come this way.

2068
01:13:28,854 --> 01:13:30,820
If no water comes out,

2069
01:13:30,823 --> 01:13:32,420
- I get to stay. - Right.

2070
01:13:32,425 --> 01:13:33,850
Jae Seok,

2071
01:13:33,859 --> 01:13:35,360
- please use your bad luck. - Yes.

2072
01:13:35,361 --> 01:13:37,660
- Please help me with your bad luck. - I have one civilian.

2073
01:13:37,663 --> 01:13:39,060
- This is my expertise. - Three.

2074
01:13:39,064 --> 01:13:40,330
- One. - You brat.

2075
01:13:40,332 --> 01:13:42,460
- One. - Our king treated you...

2076
01:13:42,468 --> 01:13:45,030
with kindness.

2077
01:13:45,037 --> 01:13:46,430
How dare you run away?

2078
01:13:46,439 --> 01:13:48,300
(He removes the first stick to bring Kwang Soo back.)

2079
01:13:48,307 --> 01:13:50,100
(There are 3 sticks to be removed.)

2080
01:13:50,109 --> 01:13:51,470
- You brat! - That was okay.

2081
01:13:51,477 --> 01:13:52,770
One.

2082
01:13:52,778 --> 01:13:54,340
(Gushing)

2083
01:13:54,346 --> 01:13:55,480
You brat!

2084
01:13:55,481 --> 01:13:59,380
(He only took one out.)

2085
01:13:59,385 --> 01:14:01,045
Welcome.

2086
01:14:01,120 --> 01:14:04,015
(Welcome back.)

2087
01:14:04,023 --> 01:14:07,285
- Come back! - The king treated you so nicely.

2088
01:14:07,426 --> 01:14:08,890
- Come. - I'm sorry!

2089
01:14:08,894 --> 01:14:10,190
(He gets dragged to Team King So Min.)

2090
01:14:10,196 --> 01:14:12,025
I'll never do that again!

2091
01:14:12,164 --> 01:14:13,360
This is driving me nuts.

2092
01:14:13,365 --> 01:14:15,330
(King Seok Jin was happy for a moment because he had a civilian.)

2093
01:14:15,334 --> 01:14:16,430
Gather.

2094
01:14:16,435 --> 01:14:18,900
(He's alone again.)

2095
01:14:18,904 --> 01:14:20,470
This is driving me nuts.

2096
01:14:20,473 --> 01:14:23,570
This is a short-answer question.

2097
01:14:23,576 --> 01:14:24,740
There are three sticks assigned.

2098
01:14:24,743 --> 01:14:26,735
I need to get this right.

2099
01:14:26,812 --> 01:14:28,210
"In five seconds..."

2100
01:14:28,214 --> 01:14:30,275
- This is difficult. - It's so hard.

2101
01:14:30,483 --> 01:14:32,310
"name five actors..."

2102
01:14:32,318 --> 01:14:33,650
"who played a king."

2103
01:14:33,652 --> 01:14:35,675
- Answer! - Answer!

2104
01:14:35,788 --> 01:14:37,420
Choi Min Sik, Han Seok Kyu,

2105
01:14:37,423 --> 01:14:38,990
Cho Joong Hoon...

2106
01:14:38,991 --> 01:14:40,420
Was it Park Joong Hoon?

2107
01:14:40,426 --> 01:14:41,860
- Answer! - Answer!

2108
01:14:41,861 --> 01:14:42,890
(It's Haha's turn.)

2109
01:14:42,895 --> 01:14:44,060
- Jung Tae Woo, Choi Su Jong, - Hong Suk Chun.

2110
01:14:44,063 --> 01:14:45,530
Yeo Jin Goo, Hong Suk Chun...

2111
01:14:45,531 --> 01:14:48,195
(Se Chan interferes.)

2112
01:14:48,267 --> 01:14:50,430
(Goodness)

2113
01:14:50,436 --> 01:14:52,100
(He's successful.)

2114
01:14:52,104 --> 01:14:53,400
Answer!

2115
01:14:53,405 --> 01:14:54,600
Han Seok Kyu, Song Joong Ki,

2116
01:14:54,607 --> 01:14:56,170
- Lee Kwang Soo, Lee Sang Yun, - Hong Suk Chun.

2117
01:14:56,175 --> 01:14:57,340
and Hong Suk Chun. Hey!

2118
01:14:57,343 --> 01:14:59,565
(He interferes again.)

2119
01:15:00,813 --> 01:15:04,635
(They can't overcome it.)

2120
01:15:05,184 --> 01:15:06,310
Answer.

2121
01:15:06,318 --> 01:15:08,150
Jung Il Woo, Lee Kwang Soo, Song Joong Ki,

2122
01:15:08,153 --> 01:15:09,450
Choi Su Jong, and Yeo Jin Goo.

2123
01:15:09,455 --> 01:15:11,620
(Jung Il Woo, Lee Kwang Soo, Song Joong Ki, )

2124
01:15:11,624 --> 01:15:14,585
(Choi Su Jong, and Yeo Jin Goo)

2125
01:15:15,227 --> 01:15:17,385
Haha. I almost had it.

2126
01:15:18,464 --> 01:15:20,060
I'm sad.

2127
01:15:20,065 --> 01:15:23,325
I would know for sure if I have another chance.

2128
01:15:23,702 --> 01:15:27,540
Is the king either...

2129
01:15:27,540 --> 01:15:29,095
Seok Jin or Il Woo?

2130
01:15:29,608 --> 01:15:32,110
One of them is the real king.

2131
01:15:32,111 --> 01:15:34,010
(One of them is the real king.)

2132
01:15:34,013 --> 01:15:36,480
I see. I knew it.

2133
01:15:36,482 --> 01:15:37,710
What is it?

2134
01:15:37,716 --> 01:15:39,210
(Is this why they were shocked?)

2135
01:15:39,218 --> 01:15:41,175
- Okay. - Haha.

2136
01:15:41,954 --> 01:15:43,720
Do you understand why I'm being quiet?

2137
01:15:43,722 --> 01:15:45,720
This is interesting.

2138
01:15:45,724 --> 01:15:47,920
- What is it? - I'm so curious.

2139
01:15:47,927 --> 01:15:49,420
(Is King Il Woo making a move?)

2140
01:15:49,428 --> 01:15:50,760
Do I pick?

2141
01:15:50,763 --> 01:15:51,890
Yes, pick three.

2142
01:15:51,897 --> 01:15:52,890
(He can pick 3 sticks. Who will he choose?)

2143
01:15:52,898 --> 01:15:55,055
They're all looking at Seok Jin.

2144
01:15:55,134 --> 01:15:56,260
(Jae Seok and Kwang Soo picked King Seok Jin...)

2145
01:15:56,268 --> 01:15:57,430
(after seeing the second hint.)

2146
01:15:57,436 --> 01:15:58,930
There must be a hint.

2147
01:15:58,938 --> 01:16:03,935
(King Il Woo finally broke silence.)

2148
01:16:04,443 --> 01:16:07,710
(Where will Haha go?)

2149
01:16:07,713 --> 01:16:09,435
Go. Come on.

2150
01:16:09,682 --> 01:16:11,305
- Seok Jin? - Go.

2151
01:16:11,584 --> 01:16:12,680
It's him.

2152
01:16:12,685 --> 01:16:14,320
I knew it. Three.

2153
01:16:14,320 --> 01:16:15,845
Come out.

2154
01:16:16,021 --> 01:16:17,850
(He removes the first stick.)

2155
01:16:17,856 --> 01:16:19,515
What if it doesn't come out?

2156
01:16:20,392 --> 01:16:22,720
(He removes the second stick.)

2157
01:16:22,728 --> 01:16:24,255
I did it.

2158
01:16:25,264 --> 01:16:27,130
(With King Seok Jin's tears, Haha returns to the team.)

2159
01:16:27,132 --> 01:16:28,760
I did it.

2160
01:16:28,767 --> 01:16:30,725
Haha went back.

2161
01:16:31,136 --> 01:16:32,300
- Okay. - Okay.

2162
01:16:32,304 --> 01:16:33,430
Move over, Kwang Soo.

2163
01:16:33,439 --> 01:16:36,400
I'm so curious. I have no idea.

2164
01:16:36,408 --> 01:16:38,535
- You have to get this right. - I know.

2165
01:16:38,611 --> 01:16:40,570
- This one's easy. - Okay.

2166
01:16:40,579 --> 01:16:43,680
There are three sticks assigned as well.

2167
01:16:43,682 --> 01:16:46,680
"In the Joseon Dynasty period, one of the state examinations..."

2168
01:16:46,685 --> 01:16:48,845
You can get this right. You've written them.

2169
01:16:48,854 --> 01:16:50,345
I did?

2170
01:16:50,723 --> 01:16:52,020
I took it three times.

2171
01:16:52,024 --> 01:16:53,320
You've taken the state examination.

2172
01:16:53,325 --> 01:16:56,590
Right, he took three pairs of straw shoes and went to Hanyang.

2173
01:16:56,595 --> 01:16:57,660
Hanyang.

2174
01:16:57,663 --> 01:16:59,230
You've taken the state examination.

2175
01:16:59,231 --> 01:17:00,460
I studied with Yi Mong Ryong.

2176
01:17:00,466 --> 01:17:01,700
(How old is he then?)

2177
01:17:01,700 --> 01:17:03,060
"In the Joseon Dynasty period,"

2178
01:17:03,068 --> 01:17:07,170
"one of the state examinations was Hwanggamje."

2179
01:17:07,172 --> 01:17:08,170
"Hwanggamje"?

2180
01:17:08,173 --> 01:17:12,910
"It was held to commemorate the event..."

2181
01:17:12,911 --> 01:17:15,305
"where people put this fruit at the king's feet."

2182
01:17:15,581 --> 01:17:17,080
What is this fruit?

2183
01:17:17,082 --> 01:17:18,810
- Answer. - Answer.

2184
01:17:18,817 --> 01:17:20,750
"Hwanggam" is "Yellow persimmon", so it must be a tangerine.

2185
01:17:20,753 --> 01:17:22,350
It's a multiple-choice question. What's the number?

2186
01:17:22,354 --> 01:17:24,320
(It's a multiple-choice question.)

2187
01:17:24,323 --> 01:17:25,850
Three, Tangerine.

2188
01:17:25,858 --> 01:17:27,490
- What's the number? - Three, Tangerine.

2189
01:17:27,493 --> 01:17:28,490
(Incorrect)

2190
01:17:28,494 --> 01:17:30,220
Answer! One, Tangerine.

2191
01:17:30,229 --> 01:17:31,590
(He steals the answer.)

2192
01:17:31,597 --> 01:17:32,890
(No way.)

2193
01:17:32,898 --> 01:17:34,560
- Please say it again. - One, Tangerine.

2194
01:17:34,566 --> 01:17:36,030
Is it tangerine?

2195
01:17:36,035 --> 01:17:37,995
It's tangerine.

2196
01:17:38,637 --> 01:17:40,125
It's tangerine.

2197
01:17:40,873 --> 01:17:42,940
What do I do now? Do I ask for a hint?

2198
01:17:42,941 --> 01:17:44,410
Do I ask for a hint first?

2199
01:17:44,410 --> 01:17:45,970
Okay.

2200
01:17:45,978 --> 01:17:47,510
That's good.

2201
01:17:47,513 --> 01:17:50,210
Is either Jung Il Woo or Jeon So Min...

2202
01:17:50,215 --> 01:17:51,805
a king?

2203
01:17:53,152 --> 01:17:56,280
(Three questions revealed that So Min is a fake king.)

2204
01:17:56,288 --> 01:17:58,850
Is either Jung Il Woo or Jeon So Min a king?

2205
01:17:58,857 --> 01:18:00,820
(If the answer is yes, Il Woo is the real king.)

2206
01:18:00,826 --> 01:18:04,455
(If the answer is no, Seok Jin is the real king.)

2207
01:18:05,664 --> 01:18:07,225
Neither of them...

2208
01:18:07,966 --> 01:18:09,230
is a king.

2209
01:18:09,234 --> 01:18:13,365
(Neither of them is a king.)

2210
01:18:14,973 --> 01:18:17,970
(The real king is...)

2211
01:18:17,976 --> 01:18:21,405
(Seok Jin.)

2212
01:18:22,414 --> 01:18:24,605
Do I pick one out of three?

2213
01:18:24,650 --> 01:18:26,280
(Only one is the real king's royal seal.)

2214
01:18:26,285 --> 01:18:27,845
Okay.

2215
01:18:28,253 --> 01:18:30,045
It will either say "King" or "Nobody", right?

2216
01:18:30,122 --> 01:18:33,220
(The royal seal Seok Jin chose...)

2217
01:18:33,225 --> 01:18:37,015
(belonged to the real king.)

2218
01:18:37,096 --> 01:18:39,260
My time has come.

2219
01:18:39,264 --> 01:18:41,125
(I can't believe I am the real king.)

2220
01:18:41,633 --> 01:18:44,500
(He suddenly becomes majestic.)

2221
01:18:44,503 --> 01:18:45,570
Okay.

2222
01:18:45,571 --> 01:18:46,870
Jee Seok Jin.

2223
01:18:46,872 --> 01:18:49,735
(He goes to remove the real king's sticks.)

2224
01:18:51,076 --> 01:18:53,570
Okay. Jee Seok Jin.

2225
01:18:53,579 --> 01:18:54,710
(He removes 3 sticks at the same time.)

2226
01:18:54,713 --> 01:18:56,505
Okay.

2227
01:18:56,782 --> 01:18:57,950
Okay.

2228
01:18:57,950 --> 01:18:59,650
(Jong Kook enters King Seok Jin's kingdom.)

2229
01:18:59,651 --> 01:19:02,945
I am saved.

2230
01:19:03,689 --> 01:19:06,285
Il Woo, do you have an excuse?

2231
01:19:06,558 --> 01:19:09,155
I don't want to die.

2232
01:19:09,528 --> 01:19:11,260
I don't want to die.

2233
01:19:11,263 --> 01:19:13,460
This kingdom is poor,

2234
01:19:13,465 --> 01:19:15,325
but the king is real.

2235
01:19:15,768 --> 01:19:16,930
It's just a poor kingdom.

2236
01:19:16,935 --> 01:19:18,530
Now you know the truth.

2237
01:19:18,537 --> 01:19:21,270
Here comes the last question.

2238
01:19:21,273 --> 01:19:22,940
I will get it right and leave.

2239
01:19:22,941 --> 01:19:25,070
The person who gets this question right will survive.

2240
01:19:25,077 --> 01:19:26,640
(The real king's civilians can sit still.)

2241
01:19:26,645 --> 01:19:28,940
This question is worth three sticks.

2242
01:19:28,947 --> 01:19:31,945
"In 'The Annals of the Joseon Dynasty'..."

2243
01:19:32,084 --> 01:19:34,050
"are records of a bird oil."

2244
01:19:34,052 --> 01:19:37,515
"It was a precious gift to the king from Pyeongan Province..."

2245
01:19:37,689 --> 01:19:41,590
"which was effective in treating skin diseases..."

2246
01:19:41,593 --> 01:19:43,560
"and various ailments."

2247
01:19:43,562 --> 01:19:45,960
"What is this bird?"

2248
01:19:45,964 --> 01:19:48,555
One, Flamingo.

2249
01:19:49,334 --> 01:19:51,700
Two, Pelican.

2250
01:19:51,703 --> 01:19:53,100
- What? - Did pelicans exist back then?

2251
01:19:53,105 --> 01:19:55,270
Three, Albatross.

2252
01:19:55,274 --> 01:19:57,765
Answer! One, Flamingo.

2253
01:19:57,843 --> 01:20:00,070
- Answer! - Answer!

2254
01:20:00,078 --> 01:20:02,140
(Haha gives it a try.)

2255
01:20:02,147 --> 01:20:04,610
(Will Haha get the answer right?)

2256
01:20:04,616 --> 01:20:06,010
Two, Pelican.

2257
01:20:06,018 --> 01:20:07,550
- Really? - I am right.

2258
01:20:07,553 --> 01:20:09,515
- Is he right? - I know I am right.

2259
01:20:09,855 --> 01:20:11,520
- Really? - All right!

2260
01:20:11,523 --> 01:20:13,485
(Pelican is the answer.)

2261
01:20:13,792 --> 01:20:15,860
You shouldn't have gotten it right. Now, you have to switch places.

2262
01:20:15,861 --> 01:20:18,260
- You have to switch places. - You have to switch places.

2263
01:20:18,263 --> 01:20:19,390
(He has to switch places with a civilian of another kingdom.)

2264
01:20:19,398 --> 01:20:21,760
(He is buffering.)

2265
01:20:21,767 --> 01:20:24,000
Haha, switch places with me!

2266
01:20:24,002 --> 01:20:25,700
- Switch places with me! - You have to switch places.

2267
01:20:25,704 --> 01:20:27,100
I don't mind the spilling water.

2268
01:20:27,105 --> 01:20:28,670
I want to wet my face with water.

2269
01:20:28,674 --> 01:20:29,870
I don't mind the spilling water.

2270
01:20:29,875 --> 01:20:31,940
- You have to switch places. - I want to get hit with water.

2271
01:20:31,944 --> 01:20:33,940
You should aim to pull out three sticks...

2272
01:20:33,946 --> 01:20:35,310
and have no water come out.

2273
01:20:35,314 --> 01:20:37,705
That's right. That's your only chance.

2274
01:20:38,517 --> 01:20:40,110
- Haha. - Haha.

2275
01:20:40,118 --> 01:20:42,045
Pick A Ra.

2276
01:20:42,120 --> 01:20:43,320
Pick A Ra.

2277
01:20:43,322 --> 01:20:44,350
(She looks the saddest.)

2278
01:20:44,356 --> 01:20:45,550
Pick A Ra.

2279
01:20:45,557 --> 01:20:47,390
- I will pick... - A Ra.

2280
01:20:47,392 --> 01:20:50,560
- Please. - A Ra, come to the paradise.

2281
01:20:50,562 --> 01:20:52,690
- I want to live. - Pull out three sticks.

2282
01:20:52,698 --> 01:20:53,960
- I want to live. - Three sticks.

2283
01:20:53,966 --> 01:20:55,760
- All right. - Three sticks.

2284
01:20:55,767 --> 01:20:58,100
- In 1, 2, 3. - Haha doesn't want water to spill.

2285
01:20:58,103 --> 01:21:00,425
(He removes the first stick.)

2286
01:21:00,939 --> 01:21:03,600
(A Ra needs the water to spill in order to escape.)

2287
01:21:03,609 --> 01:21:06,110
(Haha doesn't want water to spill.)

2288
01:21:06,111 --> 01:21:08,705
(Pouring out)

2289
01:21:09,481 --> 01:21:10,640
It only took one try.

2290
01:21:10,649 --> 01:21:13,810
I want to be hit with water. No, I want to be hit with water.

2291
01:21:13,819 --> 01:21:19,345
I want to be hit with water.

2292
01:21:19,558 --> 01:21:22,520
- Go, A Ra. Congratulations. - Il Woo.

2293
01:21:22,527 --> 01:21:23,760
Welcome.

2294
01:21:23,762 --> 01:21:25,030
Il Woo.

2295
01:21:25,030 --> 01:21:26,560
(Thus, the descendants said "Haha" whenever they were incredulous.)

2296
01:21:26,565 --> 01:21:28,430
- This is driving me crazy. - Let's now go...

2297
01:21:28,433 --> 01:21:30,795
to the platform of judgment.

2298
01:21:32,371 --> 01:21:34,030
(Current team status)

2299
01:21:34,039 --> 01:21:36,295
(Jae Seok and Yul have the treason rights.)

2300
01:21:36,775 --> 01:21:38,240
You are jealous, right?

2301
01:21:38,243 --> 01:21:41,440
Will You Be the King or Nobody?

2302
01:21:41,446 --> 01:21:43,140
Before the final judgment,

2303
01:21:43,148 --> 01:21:47,505
King So Min's Kingdom has five civilians,

2304
01:21:47,552 --> 01:21:48,750
which is the highest number.

2305
01:21:48,754 --> 01:21:52,015
We will now have the last treason time.

2306
01:21:52,424 --> 01:21:54,220
There is the treason time.

2307
01:21:54,226 --> 01:21:55,320
(Use treason time to choose one king to stand on the platform.)

2308
01:21:55,327 --> 01:21:59,260
Jae Seok and Yul have the treason right.

2309
01:21:59,264 --> 01:22:02,330
Move to the team you think has...

2310
01:22:02,334 --> 01:22:03,800
the real king.

2311
01:22:03,802 --> 01:22:05,530
Jae Seok, go first.

2312
01:22:05,537 --> 01:22:06,600
In one...

2313
01:22:06,605 --> 01:22:08,970
(What is Jae Seok's choice?)

2314
01:22:08,974 --> 01:22:10,070
My king.

2315
01:22:10,075 --> 01:22:12,110
(There is only one answer.)

2316
01:22:12,110 --> 01:22:13,840
(Seok Jin is the real king.)

2317
01:22:13,845 --> 01:22:15,610
Come here.

2318
01:22:15,614 --> 01:22:18,180
- You did it. - All right.

2319
01:22:18,183 --> 01:22:19,480
- All right. - He is wise.

2320
01:22:19,484 --> 01:22:21,350
- He is wise. - I will use my treason right.

2321
01:22:21,353 --> 01:22:23,045
Yul.

2322
01:22:23,188 --> 01:22:25,190
- I will use it. - We will win if he comes to us.

2323
01:22:25,190 --> 01:22:27,520
2, 3.

2324
01:22:27,526 --> 01:22:29,985
- My king. - Come here.

2325
01:22:30,462 --> 01:22:32,760
(Welcome to King Seok Jin's kingdom.)

2326
01:22:32,764 --> 01:22:34,900
- My king. - General Kwon Yul.

2327
01:22:34,900 --> 01:22:36,725
My king!

2328
01:22:36,935 --> 01:22:38,770
- My king! - General Kwon Yul.

2329
01:22:38,770 --> 01:22:40,595
My king!

2330
01:22:40,739 --> 01:22:41,900
My king!

2331
01:22:41,907 --> 01:22:44,640
The most number of civilians...

2332
01:22:44,643 --> 01:22:47,510
chose Seok Jin as the king.

2333
01:22:47,512 --> 01:22:50,105
- Please go up to the throne. - Okay.

2334
01:22:51,650 --> 01:22:54,610
- My king. - Follow me.

2335
01:22:54,619 --> 01:22:58,820
Let's hear a few words from our guests first.

2336
01:22:58,824 --> 01:23:01,390
It was nice to open 2019 with Running Man.

2337
01:23:01,393 --> 01:23:03,890
I had a fun time.

2338
01:23:03,895 --> 01:23:06,090
I received the energy of the king.

2339
01:23:06,098 --> 01:23:08,825
Happy New Year.

2340
01:23:08,967 --> 01:23:10,860
Please send a lot of love to "Haechi".

2341
01:23:10,869 --> 01:23:12,695
Thank you.

2342
01:23:13,739 --> 01:23:17,170
Will I be the king?

2343
01:23:17,175 --> 01:23:19,570
(Will I be the king?)

2344
01:23:19,578 --> 01:23:21,010
I was out of my mind!

2345
01:23:21,013 --> 01:23:23,440
(Two kingdoms that served pretenders are hit with a water bomb.)

2346
01:23:23,448 --> 01:23:24,480
My goodness.

2347
01:23:24,483 --> 01:23:26,805
(Splashing)

2348
01:23:27,252 --> 01:23:29,850
(Happy New Year.)

2349
01:23:29,855 --> 01:23:31,350
I am the king!

2350
01:23:31,356 --> 01:23:34,190
(We will work hard in the Year of the Golden Pig.)

2351
01:23:34,192 --> 01:23:38,055
(Roulette chose Jong Kook and Ji Hyo as the winning couple.)

2352
01:23:38,363 --> 01:23:40,760
(However, their partnership didn't last forever.)

2353
01:23:40,766 --> 01:23:43,055
(Monopoly)

2354
01:23:43,068 --> 01:23:45,270
(They have a showdown for the prize money.)

2355
01:23:45,270 --> 01:23:47,865
(Jong Kook and Ji Hyo go against each other.)

2356
01:23:48,473 --> 01:23:51,270
(For the first time in the history of Running Man, )

2357
01:23:51,276 --> 01:23:53,970
(the two best members will compete against each other.)

2358
01:23:53,979 --> 01:23:55,805
(Champion versus Ace)

2359
01:23:55,847 --> 01:23:58,650
(A legendary match begins to monopolize the prize money.)

2360
01:23:58,650 --> 01:24:01,550
(No one backs down in this neck-and-neck match.)

2361
01:24:01,553 --> 01:24:03,050
(Champion versus Ace)

2362
01:24:03,055 --> 01:24:04,720
(Between the Ace and Champion, )

2363
01:24:04,723 --> 01:24:07,320
(who will be the final winner of the legendary match?)

2364
01:24:07,325 --> 01:24:10,415
(Ace versus Champion)
