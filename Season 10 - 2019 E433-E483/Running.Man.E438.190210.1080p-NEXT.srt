1
00:00:06,790 --> 00:00:08,477
- Hello. - Hi.

2
00:00:08,790 --> 00:00:11,858
2019 New Year Project,

3
00:00:11,859 --> 00:00:13,374
- Level Up Race. - Yes.

4
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:16,732
- Congratulations on your winning. - Yes.

5
00:00:17,430 --> 00:00:18,468
Who will it be?

6
00:00:18,469 --> 00:00:21,898
(At the random roulette to reach the highest level from last race...)

7
00:00:21,899 --> 00:00:23,408
(Kim Jong Kook and Song Ji Hyo)

8
00:00:23,409 --> 00:00:27,854
(Jong Kook and Ji Hyo were chosen.)

9
00:00:27,879 --> 00:00:31,579
(The winners must decide if they'll use SBS' corporate card,)

10
00:00:31,580 --> 00:00:33,600
(their reward, together or not.)

11
00:00:35,879 --> 00:00:37,318
On the cards...

12
00:00:37,319 --> 00:00:38,848
(The time to decide has come at last.)

13
00:00:38,849 --> 00:00:42,223
"Alone" and "together" are written.

14
00:00:42,760 --> 00:00:45,486
- If both of you choose "together", - Yes.

15
00:00:46,229 --> 00:00:48,986
each of you will get to spend half of the credit limit.

16
00:00:49,930 --> 00:00:51,314
If both of you choose to spend it alone,

17
00:00:51,900 --> 00:00:54,738
you will go through a match, and only the winner...

18
00:00:54,739 --> 00:00:56,386
will get to spend the money on his or her own.

19
00:00:56,570 --> 00:00:57,984
- Only one of us will get it? - Yes.

20
00:00:58,040 --> 00:01:00,806
However, if one of you chooses to spend it together...

21
00:01:00,879 --> 00:01:03,274
and the other chooses to spend it alone,

22
00:01:03,650 --> 00:01:05,908
only the one who chose to spend it alone will get the reward.

23
00:01:05,909 --> 00:01:07,018
Goodness.

24
00:01:07,019 --> 00:01:08,219
(The one who chose to spend it alone will get the reward.)

25
00:01:08,220 --> 00:01:10,037
Okay. I got it.

26
00:01:10,390 --> 00:01:13,419
- Well... Okay. - Think very carefully.

27
00:01:13,420 --> 00:01:14,788
(But Jong Kook, do you remember?)

28
00:01:14,789 --> 00:01:16,059
I will think carefully about it.

29
00:01:16,060 --> 00:01:17,675
(But Jong Kook, do you remember?)

30
00:01:17,730 --> 00:01:21,235
(We were so happy then.)

31
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:23,988
Then we will check the cards now.

32
00:01:24,530 --> 00:01:25,799
(Yes, Ji Hyo. We won because we were together.)

33
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:28,368
1, 2...

34
00:01:28,369 --> 00:01:30,008
(What will happen to them and the prize money?)

35
00:01:30,009 --> 00:01:31,008
Three.

36
00:01:31,009 --> 00:01:32,485
(What will happen to them and the prize money?)

37
00:01:33,679 --> 00:01:34,689
Here.

38
00:01:35,539 --> 00:01:38,079
(Jong Kook chooses to spend the money alone.)

39
00:01:38,080 --> 00:01:40,543
(Ji Hyo also chooses to spend it alone.)

40
00:01:41,050 --> 00:01:42,090
"Alone"?

41
00:01:42,319 --> 00:01:43,618
- What did you choose? - "Alone".

42
00:01:43,619 --> 00:01:45,689
You also chose to spend it alone.

43
00:01:45,690 --> 00:01:48,318
- Hey, I couldn't let you take it. - You chose the same card.

44
00:01:48,319 --> 00:01:50,029
- I was thinking the same. - By the way,

45
00:01:50,030 --> 00:01:53,665
I thought that if I chose this "together" card,

46
00:01:54,129 --> 00:01:55,544
I knew that it wouldn't work well for us.

47
00:01:55,899 --> 00:01:57,748
We need to take a break.

48
00:01:57,800 --> 00:02:00,038
If we decide to spend the money together,

49
00:02:00,039 --> 00:02:01,768
- it would turn out weird. - I got it.

50
00:02:01,769 --> 00:02:03,839
- I thought I should get rid of it. - I got it.

51
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:05,688
- I'll spend it alone. - Same here.

52
00:02:05,769 --> 00:02:07,861
Since both of you chose to spend it alone,

53
00:02:08,340 --> 00:02:10,531
after going through a match, only one of you will...

54
00:02:10,679 --> 00:02:13,143
- get the entire prize money alone. - Great.

55
00:02:13,849 --> 00:02:16,850
If you were to get the entire prize money alone,

56
00:02:17,219 --> 00:02:18,402
is there anything you'd like to do?

57
00:02:19,189 --> 00:02:22,321
I've been telling you about this for a long time now.

58
00:02:22,689 --> 00:02:23,699
I think...

59
00:02:23,989 --> 00:02:26,453
I have to go to LA.

60
00:02:27,459 --> 00:02:29,398
(The City of Angels everyone dreams of going, LA)

61
00:02:29,399 --> 00:02:32,157
It's my second hometown which I love very much.

62
00:02:32,230 --> 00:02:34,966
I would like to go there.

63
00:02:35,369 --> 00:02:37,569
Even if we film for 24 hours,

64
00:02:37,570 --> 00:02:39,286
I would welcome it as long as it's in LA.

65
00:02:39,739 --> 00:02:42,437
I would be so happy even if we film for 24 hours.

66
00:02:43,709 --> 00:02:45,479
I want to go to LA.

67
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:46,561
(His dream and career align.)

68
00:02:47,380 --> 00:02:49,688
(How much does he love LA?)

69
00:02:49,689 --> 00:02:50,699
I also want to...

70
00:02:51,390 --> 00:02:53,859
- experience LA he's talking about. - Why would you go there?

71
00:02:53,860 --> 00:02:56,218
(I want to go to LA too!)

72
00:02:56,219 --> 00:02:57,528
Why would you go to LA?

73
00:02:57,529 --> 00:03:00,529
You've been there many times, but this would be my first time.

74
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:01,859
You've never been to LA?

75
00:03:01,860 --> 00:03:05,030
- No, I'd like to know about LA. - Really?

76
00:03:05,529 --> 00:03:07,199
I want to experience the city too.

77
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:09,609
I want to go to LA too!

78
00:03:09,610 --> 00:03:11,993
Goodness, this is weird.

79
00:03:14,209 --> 00:03:16,278
(A few days later)

80
00:03:16,279 --> 00:03:18,109
- Hello. - My goodness.

81
00:03:18,110 --> 00:03:19,321
- Gosh. - Hello.

82
00:03:19,820 --> 00:03:21,148
What's all this?

83
00:03:21,149 --> 00:03:22,678
- Hello. - Gosh, look at this.

84
00:03:22,679 --> 00:03:23,748
Hey, let's sit here.

85
00:03:23,749 --> 00:03:26,218
- What's this? - It smells so good.

86
00:03:26,219 --> 00:03:27,759
Everyone, what you're seeing now...

87
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:30,188
is a family meal from the South of the US.

88
00:03:30,189 --> 00:03:31,558
I was really hungry.

89
00:03:31,559 --> 00:03:34,829
Everyone, this is a meal...

90
00:03:34,830 --> 00:03:37,051
for the winners of Level Up Race.

91
00:03:37,100 --> 00:03:39,838
(Congratulations on your winning once again.)

92
00:03:39,839 --> 00:03:42,062
- Eat a lot. - Are you buying?

93
00:03:42,170 --> 00:03:43,368
Thank you for the food.

94
00:03:43,369 --> 00:03:44,539
(It's my treat.)

95
00:03:44,540 --> 00:03:46,479
- This is delicious. - Hey, it's good.

96
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:47,738
This is delicious.

97
00:03:47,739 --> 00:03:49,438
(The exotic flavors fill their mouths.)

98
00:03:49,439 --> 00:03:52,049
(It feels as if they are in the US at the moment.)

99
00:03:52,050 --> 00:03:53,635
- It's good. - It's so good.

100
00:03:53,880 --> 00:03:55,778
I guess I like the food from the South.

101
00:03:55,779 --> 00:03:57,148
(It's perfect for the members.)

102
00:03:57,149 --> 00:03:58,199
This is great.

103
00:03:59,189 --> 00:04:01,887
Did you see what Seok Jin posted on his social media recently?

104
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:04,988
- What did he upload? - He took a photo with Cha Eun Woo.

105
00:04:04,989 --> 00:04:07,484
- Eun Woo from his radio show? - Yes.

106
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:10,528
Why did you post that photo? There were other members too.

107
00:04:10,529 --> 00:04:12,268
Should you only mention Eun Woo in the post?

108
00:04:12,269 --> 00:04:13,998
It's not that. I just wrote that,

109
00:04:13,999 --> 00:04:16,463
"Out of all places, I stood next to the handsome guy, Eun Woo."

110
00:04:16,910 --> 00:04:18,139
- That's what I wrote. - I see.

111
00:04:18,140 --> 00:04:20,938
By the way, there's the ugliest guy next to a handsome guy.

112
00:04:20,939 --> 00:04:22,779
- Why am I the ugliest? - Yes, you are.

113
00:04:22,780 --> 00:04:25,578
- The comments are blowing up. - Why?

114
00:04:25,780 --> 00:04:28,219
They wrote that I must have looked great in my young days.

115
00:04:28,220 --> 00:04:31,289
(Why is he suddenly feeling proud of his looks?)

116
00:04:31,290 --> 00:04:33,118
- Really? - No way. We have your photo.

117
00:04:33,119 --> 00:04:35,488
They wrote that they didn't know how small my face was before.

118
00:04:35,489 --> 00:04:36,488
Here it is.

119
00:04:36,489 --> 00:04:38,580
(Providing Seok Jin's photo)

120
00:04:39,489 --> 00:04:40,540
Here it is.

121
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:44,198
(Given how old it is, the photo shows vivid colors.)

122
00:04:44,199 --> 00:04:45,998
- I can only see his nose. - Hey.

123
00:04:45,999 --> 00:04:48,138
- He was in his 20s. - Where did you get this photo?

124
00:04:48,139 --> 00:04:49,988
- Seok Jin was in his 20s. - I don't even have that photo.

125
00:04:50,170 --> 00:04:52,409
- He was one of a kind. - This is Seok Jin in his 20s.

126
00:04:52,410 --> 00:04:53,709
- What's wrong with you? - He actually looks younger now.

127
00:04:53,710 --> 00:04:55,638
- Doesn't he look better now? - You look younger now.

128
00:04:55,639 --> 00:04:57,209
- Exactly. - He aged very nicely.

129
00:04:57,210 --> 00:04:59,906
Today, we will determine...

130
00:04:59,949 --> 00:05:03,556
the final winner of Level Up Race. It's the Ace versus the Champion.

131
00:05:04,489 --> 00:05:07,219
It's the Ace versus the Champion. It's called La La Land Race.

132
00:05:07,220 --> 00:05:08,289
La La Land?

133
00:05:08,290 --> 00:05:10,006
(La La Land Race will determine the final winner.)

134
00:05:10,030 --> 00:05:11,948
After the match between them,

135
00:05:12,129 --> 00:05:15,059
we will cover all the expenses that will incur...

136
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:16,969
- during the winner's trip. - Yes!

137
00:05:16,970 --> 00:05:17,969
Really?

138
00:05:17,970 --> 00:05:20,698
As for the rest of the members,

139
00:05:20,699 --> 00:05:23,700
you will listen to Ji Hyo and Jong Kook's trip itineraries to LA.

140
00:05:24,439 --> 00:05:27,609
Pick the team leader with the trip that's more attractive to you.

141
00:05:27,610 --> 00:05:28,690
We'll get to choose.

142
00:05:28,809 --> 00:05:29,878
- We'll choose them? - Yes.

143
00:05:29,879 --> 00:05:32,606
- You'll play games together today. - Okay.

144
00:05:32,780 --> 00:05:35,881
The team leader of the winning team...

145
00:05:36,650 --> 00:05:39,318
can go to LA with only one teammate...

146
00:05:39,319 --> 00:05:40,618
of his or her choosing.

147
00:05:40,619 --> 00:05:43,115
Then it would be just the 2 of them, right? Just the 2 of them?

148
00:05:43,489 --> 00:05:45,188
- Just the two of them? - My gosh.

149
00:05:45,189 --> 00:05:46,188
It will be just the two of them?

150
00:05:46,189 --> 00:05:48,359
- If we were to go as a group... - What about three?

151
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:50,450
Seriously? Isn't this obvious?

152
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:52,628
No matter who wins, they can pick each other.

153
00:05:52,629 --> 00:05:55,327
(It's bound to be Jong Kook and Ji Hyo.)

154
00:05:55,369 --> 00:05:58,769
(This is a conspiracy of cornering them together.)

155
00:05:58,770 --> 00:06:00,426
This is a complete fraud!

156
00:06:01,710 --> 00:06:03,466
- Then... - A fraud.

157
00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:04,948
- I was just curious. - Great.

158
00:06:04,949 --> 00:06:07,546
- Interlock your fingers! - Interlock your fingers!

159
00:06:08,319 --> 00:06:10,137
(Kwang Soo gets excited and teases them.)

160
00:06:10,650 --> 00:06:12,943
Kwang Soo, you're making it dusty for our food.

161
00:06:14,020 --> 00:06:15,488
- That was too much. - Okay.

162
00:06:15,489 --> 00:06:16,975
The winner chooses only one person, right?

163
00:06:17,059 --> 00:06:18,100
That's right.

164
00:06:18,860 --> 00:06:20,459
If we want to win, a team with more members will win.

165
00:06:20,460 --> 00:06:21,799
A bigger team will be more advantageous.

166
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:23,529
But to get picked, a smaller team is better.

167
00:06:23,530 --> 00:06:25,799
(To win, a bigger team is better, but to get picked, vice versa.)

168
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:28,399
All right. Jong Kook and Ji Hyo.

169
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:31,137
Please present the itineraries you have prepared.

170
00:06:31,270 --> 00:06:33,361
- Okay. - Start the briefing now.

171
00:06:33,739 --> 00:06:35,932
Why are you going to LA though?

172
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:38,398
First of all, the weather is great.

173
00:06:39,050 --> 00:06:41,444
It's sunny for 300 days out of 365 days.

174
00:06:41,579 --> 00:06:42,779
It's like deja vu.

175
00:06:42,780 --> 00:06:45,174
When you wake up, it's just like yesterday.

176
00:06:45,389 --> 00:06:46,818
When you wake up again the next day, it's the same day.

177
00:06:46,819 --> 00:06:48,089
(It's nicknamed City of Angels for its weather.)

178
00:06:48,090 --> 00:06:49,907
That's true. That's totally true.

179
00:06:50,030 --> 00:06:52,428
- I think I might get bored. - Yes, I agree.

180
00:06:52,429 --> 00:06:53,928
(Trolling from the start)

181
00:06:53,929 --> 00:06:54,998
What? No, no.

182
00:06:54,999 --> 00:06:56,428
The weather has to be exciting.

183
00:06:56,429 --> 00:06:58,722
There must be rain, hail, and lightning.

184
00:06:58,929 --> 00:07:00,617
And the sky is very clear.

185
00:07:00,699 --> 00:07:02,568
- I like clouds in the sky. - Shouldn't there be some clouds?

186
00:07:02,569 --> 00:07:04,269
- There should be some clouds. - That's right.

187
00:07:04,270 --> 00:07:05,724
I think it might be boring.

188
00:07:05,770 --> 00:07:08,739
- It should rain and snow. - Do you like clouds?

189
00:07:08,879 --> 00:07:12,919
You should go to London then. Go to London then.

190
00:07:12,949 --> 00:07:13,948
(Go to London if you don't like LA.)

191
00:07:13,949 --> 00:07:15,818
- That would be great then. - How could you say that suddenly?

192
00:07:15,819 --> 00:07:18,011
- My goodness. - Hey, Jong Kook.

193
00:07:18,090 --> 00:07:20,917
You sound very angry. I mean, you're trying to gather members.

194
00:07:21,020 --> 00:07:23,058
- Hear me out. You must hear me out. - Sure, sure.

195
00:07:23,059 --> 00:07:25,252
All right. Here we go. I'll start.

196
00:07:25,290 --> 00:07:28,057
When you land in LA, you'll get hungry no matter what.

197
00:07:28,300 --> 00:07:30,723
The first place we'll go after we land is...

198
00:07:30,999 --> 00:07:32,009
A burger joint?

199
00:07:34,300 --> 00:07:40,037
(What is the first mouthwatering American dish they will have?)

200
00:07:40,780 --> 00:07:42,438
We'll go to Koreatown and have Korean food first.

201
00:07:42,439 --> 00:07:45,813
(The first meal will be Korean food.)

202
00:07:45,850 --> 00:07:47,394
- Soft tofu! - Yes!

203
00:07:48,179 --> 00:07:51,118
- It's amazing. If we eat... - Seafood soft tofu.

204
00:07:51,119 --> 00:07:52,589
American food right away, it'll be hard for us.

205
00:07:52,590 --> 00:07:54,789
The soft tofu place was right next to my lodging.

206
00:07:54,790 --> 00:07:57,428
- Have you had that? - I ate that every day.

207
00:07:57,429 --> 00:08:00,299
- I ate that as soon as I woke up. - Right.

208
00:08:00,300 --> 00:08:03,698
Will we get to eat that soft tofu? Will we get to eat that?

209
00:08:03,699 --> 00:08:05,868
- Of course. - By the way,

210
00:08:05,869 --> 00:08:08,269
I've been to LA with Jong Kook a lot of times.

211
00:08:08,270 --> 00:08:09,856
Korean food in LA is really good.

212
00:08:10,139 --> 00:08:12,159
I mean it. I'm serious.

213
00:08:12,210 --> 00:08:14,709
The best noodles in radish water kimchi...

214
00:08:14,710 --> 00:08:16,779
- I ever had was in LA. - Really?

215
00:08:16,780 --> 00:08:18,979
- Korean food there is exceptional. - Over hundreds of years...

216
00:08:18,980 --> 00:08:21,444
- Gosh, the ribs. - Yes, soft tofu.

217
00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:23,267
- I don't get this. - I'm serious.

218
00:08:23,590 --> 00:08:25,719
We eat Korean food all the time. I don't understand those people...

219
00:08:25,720 --> 00:08:27,638
who eat Korean food on their trips.

220
00:08:27,989 --> 00:08:30,655
Exactly. Some people might react like Seok Jin.

221
00:08:30,759 --> 00:08:33,299
This is the great thing about LA. If you go out of Koreatown,

222
00:08:33,300 --> 00:08:36,099
you can totally feel like you're in a foreign country.

223
00:08:36,100 --> 00:08:38,428
We'll go to the place you want next. It's the baseball stadium.

224
00:08:38,429 --> 00:08:39,828
We must go to the baseball stadium.

225
00:08:39,829 --> 00:08:42,465
Shouldn't we watch LA Dodgers' game?

226
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:47,181
(Home stadium of LA Dodgers, the prestigious team of MLB)

227
00:08:47,209 --> 00:08:50,209
I'll take you to the game that Ryu Hyun Jin will pitch.

228
00:08:50,250 --> 00:08:54,016
We'll go to the Dodger Stadium and watch their game.

229
00:08:55,250 --> 00:08:56,765
- Is that really possible? - We'll watch their game when we go?

230
00:08:57,790 --> 00:08:59,818
(Having great connections is the Champion's skill too.)

231
00:08:59,819 --> 00:09:02,289
- I do want this one. LA Dodgers. - That sounds fun.

232
00:09:02,290 --> 00:09:04,058
Isn't the stadium close to a Korean restaurant?

233
00:09:04,059 --> 00:09:07,299
(Is the Korean restaurant the merit of the trip?)

234
00:09:07,300 --> 00:09:08,945
- Yes, it's close. It's very close. - Right.

235
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,098
- If you... - After the game, you can go there.

236
00:09:10,099 --> 00:09:12,269
- crave kimchi stew, you can go. - Okay.

237
00:09:12,270 --> 00:09:13,654
- That sounds fun. - The baseball stadium sounds fun.

238
00:09:13,839 --> 00:09:15,718
Seok Jin should go. He should go.

239
00:09:15,870 --> 00:09:18,539
After that, we'll head to Santa Monica.

240
00:09:18,540 --> 00:09:20,009
(It doesn't end in LA. They'll visit Santa Monica.)

241
00:09:20,010 --> 00:09:21,578
- The itinerary is great. - Of course.

242
00:09:21,579 --> 00:09:23,903
We'll head over to the beach.

243
00:09:23,949 --> 00:09:25,526
When I said Santa Monica, I meant the beach.

244
00:09:25,979 --> 00:09:27,948
Gosh, the beach.

245
00:09:27,949 --> 00:09:29,566
(The beach exudes the romance of the West Coast.)

246
00:09:30,550 --> 00:09:32,749
Gosh, sashimi from there is really delicious.

247
00:09:32,750 --> 00:09:35,389
(His love for Korean food doesn't end.)

248
00:09:35,390 --> 00:09:37,529
- It's really good. - There's a Korean sashimi place.

249
00:09:37,530 --> 00:09:40,226
- That sashimi place, right? - Yes, that one.

250
00:09:40,260 --> 00:09:41,612
The marinated crabs are great too.

251
00:09:42,059 --> 00:09:44,499
- What is this? - The marinated crabs are great too.

252
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:46,146
- It's delicious. - Hey.

253
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,120
Will there be other guests on your trip?

254
00:09:49,300 --> 00:09:50,582
- What other guests? - Well...

255
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:52,525
When we go over there,

256
00:09:52,609 --> 00:09:55,740
I know a lot of healthy and great guys.

257
00:09:55,839 --> 00:09:56,890
- They're younger than you? - Yes.

258
00:09:57,280 --> 00:09:59,208
You desperately want romance...

259
00:09:59,209 --> 00:10:01,471
- in your trip, So Min. - Yes.

260
00:10:01,520 --> 00:10:02,862
It's definitely possible.

261
00:10:03,250 --> 00:10:04,360
There are a lot of guys.

262
00:10:04,550 --> 00:10:06,641
I know a lot of great friends in LA. I'm serious.

263
00:10:06,760 --> 00:10:09,259
He really does know a lot about LA.

264
00:10:09,260 --> 00:10:11,489
- Seriously. - I like many things on his trip.

265
00:10:11,490 --> 00:10:12,540
I'm serious.

266
00:10:13,599 --> 00:10:15,519
By the way, we can't rest...

267
00:10:15,660 --> 00:10:16,899
during Jong Kook's tour.

268
00:10:16,900 --> 00:10:19,526
(By the way, we can't rest during Jong Kook's tour.)

269
00:10:20,069 --> 00:10:21,988
- I've been there with him before. - Okay.

270
00:10:22,140 --> 00:10:23,725
There were so many things we wanted to talk about.

271
00:10:23,939 --> 00:10:25,121
I was so happy,

272
00:10:25,270 --> 00:10:27,039
but you come back about 7kg lighter.

273
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:30,241
(Beware of the side effect.)

274
00:10:30,510 --> 00:10:32,578
- It's effective in losing weight. - Exactly.

275
00:10:32,579 --> 00:10:34,336
That's exactly my point.

276
00:10:34,479 --> 00:10:37,149
- Ji Hyo, it's your turn. - I like many things from his trip.

277
00:10:37,150 --> 00:10:39,371
This is my first time going to LA,

278
00:10:39,719 --> 00:10:41,811
so I came up with a list of things to do.

279
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:44,008
Actually,

280
00:10:44,760 --> 00:10:48,335
I'm not a fan of going to tourist attractions.

281
00:10:49,130 --> 00:10:51,968
- I like lounging around. - Gosh.

282
00:10:51,969 --> 00:10:54,192
- You like zoning out. - Yes, I zone out.

283
00:10:54,300 --> 00:10:56,320
- That's more like my style. - Gosh.

284
00:10:56,569 --> 00:10:58,608
I hate following a strict schedule.

285
00:10:58,609 --> 00:10:59,909
- Same here. - Right.

286
00:10:59,910 --> 00:11:02,566
I don't want to go to a lot of places.

287
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:03,909
- And... - That's right.

288
00:11:03,910 --> 00:11:06,606
- I like that about her trip. - That's great. That's how I roll.

289
00:11:06,650 --> 00:11:08,218
If we have to do whatever has been scheduled,

290
00:11:08,219 --> 00:11:09,678
- Right. - I would get stressed out...

291
00:11:09,679 --> 00:11:11,448
when I have to think about where we'll have to go next.

292
00:11:11,449 --> 00:11:13,137
- You're right. - That's why...

293
00:11:13,250 --> 00:11:16,058
we can have free time until 5pm to 6pm.

294
00:11:16,059 --> 00:11:18,928
(Dropping a bombshell)

295
00:11:18,929 --> 00:11:20,558
- Until 5pm to 6pm? - Wait.

296
00:11:20,559 --> 00:11:22,215
If so, isn't it better off to stay in Korea?

297
00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:24,198
Should we rest when we have gone all the way to LA?

298
00:11:24,199 --> 00:11:25,685
If so, we can go separately. Why would we go there together?

299
00:11:25,729 --> 00:11:27,961
Why would we go to LA and rest until 5pm?

300
00:11:28,370 --> 00:11:30,509
The sun would set around 5pm or 6pm.

301
00:11:30,510 --> 00:11:31,608
(Yes, you guys are doing great.)

302
00:11:31,609 --> 00:11:33,039
Why would we go to LA then?

303
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:34,625
It's because you want to sleep at home.

304
00:11:35,010 --> 00:11:37,879
In a way, this trip might be better. We might have more freedom.

305
00:11:37,880 --> 00:11:38,960
And...

306
00:11:39,079 --> 00:11:41,443
as you all know, Jong Kook doesn't drink.

307
00:11:41,819 --> 00:11:43,549
Yes, I don't drink alcohol.

308
00:11:43,550 --> 00:11:45,389
We can go there and have drinks together with meals.

309
00:11:45,390 --> 00:11:46,789
Will we play truth or dare?

310
00:11:46,790 --> 00:11:48,818
- We'll play that too! - Yes!

311
00:11:48,819 --> 00:11:50,358
(Ji Hyo's trump card is having drinks together.)

312
00:11:50,359 --> 00:11:52,129
(Ji Hyo finishes it off with playing truth or dare.)

313
00:11:52,130 --> 00:11:54,958
(The atmosphere totally changes after the announcement of the game.)

314
00:11:54,959 --> 00:11:56,159
- I like this great. - Ji Hyo...

315
00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:57,369
Are there any deals you'll offer us?

316
00:11:57,370 --> 00:11:59,016
Like you'll tell us a secret or something?

317
00:11:59,469 --> 00:12:01,539
Will you tell us the part you skipped...

318
00:12:01,540 --> 00:12:03,015
when you told us about your Christmas?

319
00:12:03,140 --> 00:12:04,423
That day with the balloons?

320
00:12:04,469 --> 00:12:06,125
- Will you tell us that story? - She should.

321
00:12:06,170 --> 00:12:07,438
That day with the balloons?

322
00:12:07,439 --> 00:12:11,448
(Let us elaborate on the part that Ji Hyo skipped.)

323
00:12:11,449 --> 00:12:14,519
(Her ex-boyfriend filled the room with balloons for Christmas.)

324
00:12:14,520 --> 00:12:16,914
(Her ex-boyfriend filled the room with balloons for Christmas.)

325
00:12:17,189 --> 00:12:20,519
(They had a glass of wine while feeling the romance of the event.)

326
00:12:20,520 --> 00:12:24,029
(Everyone was utterly focused.)

327
00:12:24,030 --> 00:12:27,565
(She skipped the middle part and said it was morning then.)

328
00:12:27,660 --> 00:12:31,871
(This Skipping Incident has enraged everyone.)

329
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,899
- Will you tell us the story? - Will you tell us?

330
00:12:33,900 --> 00:12:35,415
- You'll tell us what you skipped? - Will you?

331
00:12:35,469 --> 00:12:36,568
I will share it!

332
00:12:36,569 --> 00:12:39,336
(The story of Ji Hyo's night that piqued everyone's curiosity...)

333
00:12:39,439 --> 00:12:40,925
- I'll tell you! - Yes!

334
00:12:41,179 --> 00:12:42,189
I have to choose hers.

335
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:43,563
I've decided.

336
00:12:44,050 --> 00:12:45,797
I have to listen to that story.

337
00:12:45,910 --> 00:12:48,142
I couldn't sleep for a week.

338
00:12:48,420 --> 00:12:50,818
- I even made up stories. You know? - I...

339
00:12:50,819 --> 00:12:51,919
- I made up stories. - I will...

340
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:54,489
What stands out the most from Ji Hyo's tour is...

341
00:12:54,490 --> 00:12:55,600
freedom.

342
00:12:55,760 --> 00:12:57,659
- We get to do what we want. - We can do what we want.

343
00:12:57,660 --> 00:13:00,358
- And we don't have to plan a trip. - I can do my own thing, right?

344
00:13:00,359 --> 00:13:02,759
- In a way, we get to rest up. - You only live once.

345
00:13:02,760 --> 00:13:04,921
- We'll divide into teams now. - Okay.

346
00:13:05,130 --> 00:13:06,999
Gosh, this is hard to decide.

347
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,899
(The briefing is over, and they'll choose their teams.)

348
00:13:08,900 --> 00:13:11,009
- Why don't you go 1st, Se Chan? - Should I go 1st?

349
00:13:11,010 --> 00:13:12,039
(Se Chan will choose his team first.)

350
00:13:12,040 --> 00:13:13,695
To tell you the truth,

351
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:16,478
one of their traveling styles...

352
00:13:16,479 --> 00:13:18,327
matches my style completely.

353
00:13:19,250 --> 00:13:20,919
It totally matches my style of traveling.

354
00:13:20,920 --> 00:13:24,448
(Whose traveling style matches Se Chan's completely?)

355
00:13:24,449 --> 00:13:27,218
I will go with this team.

356
00:13:27,219 --> 00:13:28,229
Okay!

357
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:30,504
- Okay! - Let me explain.

358
00:13:30,729 --> 00:13:34,129
I want to tell all of my colleagues about my trip.

359
00:13:34,130 --> 00:13:35,817
- That's right. - I want to share my memories.

360
00:13:36,859 --> 00:13:38,314
- So Min, it's your turn. - Me?

361
00:13:38,370 --> 00:13:39,511
So Min, go ahead.

362
00:13:40,469 --> 00:13:42,115
I really can't decide. It's really hard.

363
00:13:42,439 --> 00:13:44,269
So Min might not choose my team,

364
00:13:44,270 --> 00:13:45,755
but she'll regret a lot...

365
00:13:45,809 --> 00:13:48,233
because I know a lot of handsome guys in LA.

366
00:13:48,910 --> 00:13:50,409
- They are so handsome. - Actually,

367
00:13:50,410 --> 00:13:52,909
when I travel, I go on my own.

368
00:13:52,910 --> 00:13:55,218
I don't need to see a lot of stuff. That's my style.

369
00:13:55,219 --> 00:13:57,845
- Just go to Jong Kook now. - Go. Go.

370
00:13:58,790 --> 00:14:00,558
(You'll pick him. Don't stall time.)

371
00:14:00,559 --> 00:14:01,631
- Just go. - Fine.

372
00:14:02,120 --> 00:14:03,419
- Okay. - Great.

373
00:14:03,420 --> 00:14:04,928
(So Min chooses Team Champion.)

374
00:14:04,929 --> 00:14:06,928
- Great. - My goodness.

375
00:14:06,929 --> 00:14:09,358
- Ji Hyo looks really sad. - No.

376
00:14:09,359 --> 00:14:11,289
- You look sad as they chose him. - No, no.

377
00:14:11,370 --> 00:14:15,539
I have been neglecting that girl a lot lately.

378
00:14:15,540 --> 00:14:17,108
(Does he mean me?)

379
00:14:17,109 --> 00:14:18,108
"That girl"?

380
00:14:18,109 --> 00:14:19,808
I must listen to her story.

381
00:14:19,809 --> 00:14:21,438
(The part of her Christmas story she skipped)

382
00:14:21,439 --> 00:14:24,249
(Haha chooses Team Ace.)

383
00:14:24,250 --> 00:14:25,592
I bet it's new.

384
00:14:26,380 --> 00:14:27,848
Kwang Soo. Well, he will...

385
00:14:27,849 --> 00:14:30,348
Kwang Soo, why don't you choose now?

386
00:14:30,349 --> 00:14:32,814
- Okay. - Kwang Soo has been to LA with me.

387
00:14:32,849 --> 00:14:35,588
- That might happen. - I'll do everything I did then.

388
00:14:35,589 --> 00:14:38,259
(As he mentions he'll do everything he did from their last trip...)

389
00:14:38,260 --> 00:14:40,558
- Remember our beautiful memories? - Seriously?

390
00:14:40,559 --> 00:14:42,114
(He reminds Kwang Soo of their memories.)

391
00:14:43,099 --> 00:14:45,328
(Do you remember our beautiful memories together?)

392
00:14:45,329 --> 00:14:48,568
(Our friendship shone like the sun in LA.)

393
00:14:48,569 --> 00:14:50,326
Remember our beautiful memories?

394
00:14:51,709 --> 00:14:53,568
(He's reminded of his bromance memories.)

395
00:14:53,569 --> 00:14:54,739
I choose Jong Kook!

396
00:14:54,740 --> 00:14:57,305
(He has decided.)

397
00:14:58,579 --> 00:15:00,649
(Kwang Soo chooses Team Champion.)

398
00:15:00,650 --> 00:15:02,419
- Come. Come to me. - Gosh.

399
00:15:02,420 --> 00:15:03,718
This is no joke.

400
00:15:03,719 --> 00:15:05,389
I'll go with Ji Hyo.

401
00:15:05,390 --> 00:15:06,531
- Okay. - Okay!

402
00:15:07,490 --> 00:15:09,540
- Ji Hyo. - He didn't come for the freedom.

403
00:15:10,059 --> 00:15:11,989
To be honest, I'm really curious about that skipped part.

404
00:15:11,990 --> 00:15:13,228
(He only has one reason.)

405
00:15:13,229 --> 00:15:14,928
I will hear the rest of the story from Ji Hyo.

406
00:15:14,929 --> 00:15:16,529
- I'll make sure I hear it. - I will too.

407
00:15:16,530 --> 00:15:18,045
- We'll talk all night long. - Okay.

408
00:15:18,170 --> 00:15:19,328
- Come join us, Seok Jin. - Okay.

409
00:15:19,329 --> 00:15:21,421
- I'll have better chances there. - Okay.

410
00:15:21,469 --> 00:15:22,954
I'll go with that team.

411
00:15:23,270 --> 00:15:24,785
I can see disappointment on your face.

412
00:15:25,339 --> 00:15:26,539
- I'm happy. - Okay.

413
00:15:26,540 --> 00:15:28,078
(Team Ace and Team Champion)

414
00:15:28,079 --> 00:15:31,240
(The teams have been formed.)

415
00:15:32,510 --> 00:15:33,934
(Ace)

416
00:15:35,179 --> 00:15:36,519
(She's always chosen and always survives.)

417
00:15:36,520 --> 00:15:40,188
(She's the queen of luck at random draws.)

418
00:15:40,189 --> 00:15:41,977
(The Lucky Ace, Song Ji Hyo)

419
00:15:43,089 --> 00:15:44,403
(Champion)

420
00:15:45,290 --> 00:15:47,428
(He dominates the games with speed and power.)

421
00:15:47,429 --> 00:15:49,479
(He's the undefeated champion, Kim Jong Kook.)

422
00:15:50,030 --> 00:15:53,403
(The best members of the show will have their official match.)

423
00:15:54,170 --> 00:15:56,261
(Ace versus the Champion, who will be the winner?)

424
00:15:57,809 --> 00:16:00,194
Today, it's the Ace versus the Champion.

425
00:16:00,579 --> 00:16:01,993
- It's a team match. - Okay.

426
00:16:02,479 --> 00:16:04,600
The match will consist of three rounds in total.

427
00:16:04,910 --> 00:16:06,808
Isn't this the first time they're competing against each other?

428
00:16:06,809 --> 00:16:07,978
- Yes, it's the first time. - Goodness.

429
00:16:07,979 --> 00:16:11,088
Depending on the results of each round,

430
00:16:11,089 --> 00:16:13,210
you will be given the slots on the roulette accordingly.

431
00:16:13,390 --> 00:16:14,789
- The slots on the roulette? - We'll spin the roulette.

432
00:16:14,790 --> 00:16:16,810
- We'll spin that again? - My gosh, the roulette.

433
00:16:17,260 --> 00:16:19,885
After the third round, you'll spin the roulette.

434
00:16:19,959 --> 00:16:22,828
The chosen member will be the final winner.

435
00:16:23,359 --> 00:16:25,420
This is your first round.

436
00:16:26,500 --> 00:16:29,799
(Ace versus the Champion, Round 1)

437
00:16:29,800 --> 00:16:32,009
It's a quiz called the Fate of Go or Stop.

438
00:16:32,010 --> 00:16:33,555
- Okay! - It's a quiz?

439
00:16:34,179 --> 00:16:35,379
Is the quiz related to the card game?

440
00:16:35,380 --> 00:16:38,136
You'll hear the quiz. If you answer the quiz correctly,

441
00:16:38,449 --> 00:16:41,853
you will choose 1 of the 10 sets...

442
00:16:42,120 --> 00:16:43,866
- on the table. - Okay.

443
00:16:44,089 --> 00:16:47,797
In each set, there are points, varying from 1 to 5.

444
00:16:48,459 --> 00:16:50,137
And there are two cups that are duds.

445
00:16:50,890 --> 00:16:53,011
- Duds? My gosh, duds. - Okay.

446
00:16:53,059 --> 00:16:55,756
When you choose the cups and gain points,

447
00:16:55,800 --> 00:16:59,132
you will earn the chosen points and have a chance to choose again.

448
00:16:59,270 --> 00:17:01,896
If you pick a dud cup, your points will go back to zero.

449
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,635
- Your points will go back to 0. - It'll go back to 0?

450
00:17:04,740 --> 00:17:06,438
- We'll lose points we gathered? - Yes.

451
00:17:06,439 --> 00:17:08,938
(Choosing to stop before the dud is the key.)

452
00:17:08,939 --> 00:17:12,010
- There's Jae Seok, the Zero Guy. - There are so many unlucky ones.

453
00:17:12,379 --> 00:17:13,608
- There's Jae Seok. - You'll lose.

454
00:17:13,609 --> 00:17:15,118
- He was Level Zero. - Yu Zero.

455
00:17:15,119 --> 00:17:16,578
- We'll win no matter what. - My gosh.

456
00:17:16,579 --> 00:17:18,206
(He went back to Level 0 from Level 1.)

457
00:17:18,389 --> 00:17:21,116
After you open up cup and want to continue on,

458
00:17:21,319 --> 00:17:22,459
you can shout, "go".

459
00:17:22,460 --> 00:17:23,759
(The points will accumulate.)

460
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:24,989
Say that you have earned points,

461
00:17:24,990 --> 00:17:26,289
- The points will accumulate. - but if it's a dud, you get zero.

462
00:17:26,290 --> 00:17:27,699
- Okay. I got it. - I should keep going.

463
00:17:27,700 --> 00:17:29,199
- These two are great at that. - Stopping at the right time is god.

464
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:30,786
- We should keep going. - Okay, great.

465
00:17:30,970 --> 00:17:32,343
Let us tell you how this game came about.

466
00:17:32,970 --> 00:17:34,556
Jong Kook is good at solving quizzes.

467
00:17:35,339 --> 00:17:37,935
- Ji Hyo is great at random draws. - Random draws.

468
00:17:38,040 --> 00:17:39,079
Hold on.

469
00:17:39,710 --> 00:17:42,133
Hold on. Are you implying that Ji Hyo is bad at solving quizzes?

470
00:17:42,379 --> 00:17:43,521
Then is she good at it?

471
00:17:43,950 --> 00:17:45,279
- We didn't say that. - Ji Hyo?

472
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:46,592
Then is she good at it?

473
00:17:46,680 --> 00:17:48,479
(Come on, how dare you?)

474
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:50,078
- When did we say that? - Did we say that?

475
00:17:50,079 --> 00:17:51,318
- Listen. - You went over that.

476
00:17:51,319 --> 00:17:52,400
And you hurt her twice.

477
00:17:52,790 --> 00:17:54,019
- Ji Hyo chooses not to do it. - This kind of questioning...

478
00:17:54,020 --> 00:17:55,088
- would offend Ji Hyo. - Sit down.

479
00:17:55,089 --> 00:17:56,877
- You hurt me twice. - Ji Hyo.

480
00:17:57,089 --> 00:17:58,989
- You just choose not to answer it. - Sure.

481
00:17:58,990 --> 00:18:01,229
Ji Hyo answered the quizzes a few times,

482
00:18:01,230 --> 00:18:03,421
but it didn't air because her answers were too shocking.

483
00:18:04,300 --> 00:18:06,724
- She goes beyond quizzes. - Hey, stop it!

484
00:18:07,899 --> 00:18:10,465
The team with more points will get five slots on the roulette.

485
00:18:11,109 --> 00:18:12,989
- The losing team will get one slot. - Okay.

486
00:18:13,879 --> 00:18:15,679
Gosh, that's a huge difference.

487
00:18:15,680 --> 00:18:17,039
My goodness, this is serious.

488
00:18:17,040 --> 00:18:19,348
- Yes, there has to be a difference. - In my opinion,

489
00:18:19,349 --> 00:18:21,249
- this is why Ji Hyo's team... - Okay.

490
00:18:21,250 --> 00:18:22,592
is called Team Ace.

491
00:18:22,849 --> 00:18:23,949
- Even if they take 5, - That 1 slot...

492
00:18:23,950 --> 00:18:25,403
- might get chosen. - we can win with one slot.

493
00:18:25,849 --> 00:18:28,142
- That's the fun of having one slot. - We'll show you that.

494
00:18:29,119 --> 00:18:31,009
Here's why our team is great. Even though she's the team leader,

495
00:18:31,460 --> 00:18:32,470
she's quiet.

496
00:18:33,659 --> 00:18:35,215
- She doesn't make requests. - That's right.

497
00:18:35,559 --> 00:18:37,721
- Just like her traveling style. - She doesn't bother us.

498
00:18:37,730 --> 00:18:38,769
Our trip will be like that too.

499
00:18:38,770 --> 00:18:40,214
- That's our traveling style too. - She won't bother us.

500
00:18:40,369 --> 00:18:42,299
- We're the definition of freedom. - Our team centers around freedom.

501
00:18:42,300 --> 00:18:43,398
- Freedom. - Right.

502
00:18:43,399 --> 00:18:44,723
They're getting way ahead of themselves.

503
00:18:45,409 --> 00:18:46,481
As for your team,

504
00:18:46,609 --> 00:18:49,838
It seems like your team revolves around Jong Kook.

505
00:18:49,839 --> 00:18:50,848
Are you not happy right now?

506
00:18:50,849 --> 00:18:52,308
- No, I am. - You can tell us.

507
00:18:52,309 --> 00:18:54,019
- I'm doing great. - Be honest.

508
00:18:54,020 --> 00:18:56,219
We stay quiet if he does.

509
00:18:56,220 --> 00:18:58,348
I'm doing fine, don't worry.

510
00:18:58,349 --> 00:19:00,049
- Ji Hyo, let me take this off. - Sure.

511
00:19:00,050 --> 00:19:01,818
- Do as you please. - I'm going to pick my nose.

512
00:19:01,819 --> 00:19:02,989
Ji Hyo, I'm going to cross my legs.

513
00:19:02,990 --> 00:19:04,808
- I don't care. - Ji Hyo.

514
00:19:05,290 --> 00:19:06,572
I'll be natural.

515
00:19:07,260 --> 00:19:08,459
Just be casual.

516
00:19:08,460 --> 00:19:09,699
Okay, let's go!

517
00:19:09,700 --> 00:19:13,811
If you get it wrong, the other team will hit you with a toy hammer.

518
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,668
- Okay. - Okay.

519
00:19:15,669 --> 00:19:17,308
- Bring it on! - That's great.

520
00:19:17,309 --> 00:19:19,039
- That's great. - Bring it on.

521
00:19:19,040 --> 00:19:20,252
Show them your strength.

522
00:19:20,940 --> 00:19:22,078
(They revolt.)

523
00:19:22,079 --> 00:19:24,402
Hey, I'm only going to hit one person.

524
00:19:25,149 --> 00:19:26,179
Just one.

525
00:19:26,180 --> 00:19:27,949
(He gets hit.)

526
00:19:27,950 --> 00:19:29,465
- Darn it. - Sorry.

527
00:19:29,819 --> 00:19:32,517
(Jae Seok also only hits one person.)

528
00:19:32,790 --> 00:19:34,388
I was just swinging it.

529
00:19:34,389 --> 00:19:37,118
- Hey. Ji Hyo, look at him. - I was just swinging.

530
00:19:37,119 --> 00:19:38,489
- All right. - Ji Hyo...

531
00:19:38,490 --> 00:19:40,580
- doesn't comment on anything. - Whatever.

532
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:42,040
Just do what you need to do.

533
00:19:43,460 --> 00:19:45,368
- You're my role model. - That's great.

534
00:19:45,369 --> 00:19:47,359
He's a 54-year-old who gets hit on the head.

535
00:19:47,399 --> 00:19:49,539
(Nevertheless, he keeps smiling.)

536
00:19:49,540 --> 00:19:52,367
- You're so cool. - My eyes should've popped out.

537
00:19:52,569 --> 00:19:53,908
They should have.

538
00:19:53,909 --> 00:19:55,279
You're right.

539
00:19:55,280 --> 00:19:56,795
First question.

540
00:19:57,480 --> 00:20:00,949
Which of these words didn't originate from playing yut?

541
00:20:00,950 --> 00:20:02,918
- Yut? - All right.

542
00:20:02,919 --> 00:20:04,636
One, "cajole".

543
00:20:04,919 --> 00:20:05,949
- What? - What is that?

544
00:20:05,950 --> 00:20:07,778
Two, "only".

545
00:20:08,589 --> 00:20:10,882
Three, "competent".

546
00:20:11,460 --> 00:20:13,308
Four, "all the same".

547
00:20:14,059 --> 00:20:15,949
Let me answer. One.

548
00:20:16,599 --> 00:20:18,417
- Let me answer. 1. - I think it's 3.

549
00:20:19,129 --> 00:20:20,199
I thought so too.

550
00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:22,039
- I think it is. - I think so.

551
00:20:22,040 --> 00:20:23,212
"Cajole".

552
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:25,039
You don't use that word when you play yut.

553
00:20:25,040 --> 00:20:26,555
I don't think...

554
00:20:26,710 --> 00:20:27,921
- they use that word. - Right.

555
00:20:28,109 --> 00:20:30,463
- Okay! - Okay!

556
00:20:31,680 --> 00:20:33,108
(They get the first question...)

557
00:20:33,109 --> 00:20:35,402
(thanks to Kwang Soo.)

558
00:20:36,349 --> 00:20:37,918
(Did you see that?)

559
00:20:37,919 --> 00:20:39,019
(You will go down today.)

560
00:20:39,020 --> 00:20:41,010
Hey, Kwang Soo.

561
00:20:41,460 --> 00:20:44,661
(You're all dead.)

562
00:20:44,859 --> 00:20:46,328
Darn it.

563
00:20:46,329 --> 00:20:47,628
(Furious)

564
00:20:47,629 --> 00:20:49,029
You're amazing. Great.

565
00:20:49,030 --> 00:20:51,529
(Team Ace, what are you doing?)

566
00:20:51,530 --> 00:20:53,098
(I almost fell asleep.)

567
00:20:53,099 --> 00:20:54,484
How did you know?

568
00:20:55,839 --> 00:20:57,338
(You just wait and see.)

569
00:20:57,339 --> 00:20:59,329
- I'm so furious. - Me too.

570
00:20:59,369 --> 00:21:01,108
- Good job. - I thought it was "only".

571
00:21:01,109 --> 00:21:02,756
The question was easy.

572
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:05,632
- Next is Team Champion. - Let's go.

573
00:21:06,050 --> 00:21:08,479
- Please pick one and open it. - Dud, dud, dud

574
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:10,742
- Dud, dud, dud - Dud, dud, dud

575
00:21:10,790 --> 00:21:12,118
Let it be a dud.

576
00:21:12,119 --> 00:21:13,648
- 5 or 6? - I recommend Kwang Soo.

577
00:21:13,649 --> 00:21:15,034
- What do you think? - I think it's four.

578
00:21:15,690 --> 00:21:17,219
- Well... - Don't pick four.

579
00:21:17,220 --> 00:21:18,328
- Right. - I'm sure.

580
00:21:18,329 --> 00:21:21,127
Which one do you pick?

581
00:21:21,430 --> 00:21:22,658
Will you be helping us?

582
00:21:22,659 --> 00:21:24,598
- The opposing team will help. - He's the helper?

583
00:21:24,599 --> 00:21:26,168
You shouldn't touch them.

584
00:21:26,169 --> 00:21:27,868
- Don't pick 4 or 6. - Don't.

585
00:21:27,869 --> 00:21:29,111
He touched them.

586
00:21:29,169 --> 00:21:30,939
(They're positive those 2 will be duds.)

587
00:21:30,940 --> 00:21:32,808
- Right. - Because I touched them?

588
00:21:32,809 --> 00:21:33,969
How dare you?

589
00:21:33,970 --> 00:21:35,338
- Right. - Take those out.

590
00:21:35,339 --> 00:21:36,652
I'm flabbergasted.

591
00:21:37,109 --> 00:21:38,422
Do you think the first one will be a dud?

592
00:21:38,750 --> 00:21:40,063
- It could be. - One?

593
00:21:40,349 --> 00:21:41,449
- 7 or 8? - Let's go with 8.

594
00:21:41,450 --> 00:21:43,036
- 8? All right. - Yes.

595
00:21:43,649 --> 00:21:45,618
(Jong Kook doesn't care about their opinions.)

596
00:21:45,619 --> 00:21:47,759
Wait, hold on.

597
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:49,189
Didn't you want the first one?

598
00:21:49,190 --> 00:21:50,230
Yes, but I changed.

599
00:21:50,490 --> 00:21:52,207
He wanted to change.

600
00:21:52,690 --> 00:21:54,781
- His opinion matters. - Wait.

601
00:21:54,899 --> 00:21:56,243
- Let's pick eight. - Just...

602
00:21:56,300 --> 00:21:58,229
Just do as Jong Kook says.

603
00:21:58,230 --> 00:21:59,729
But we should still share our opinions.

604
00:21:59,730 --> 00:22:01,668
We all had different preferences, but we followed Jong Kook.

605
00:22:01,669 --> 00:22:02,799
- It's eight. - It is.

606
00:22:02,800 --> 00:22:03,969
(Jong Kook has the power over them.)

607
00:22:03,970 --> 00:22:05,408
- Then 8, it is. - 8, please.

608
00:22:05,409 --> 00:22:06,509
All right.

609
00:22:06,510 --> 00:22:08,239
(This was Jong Kook's choice.)

610
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:13,127
(Will he be able to avoid the dud?)

611
00:22:14,250 --> 00:22:15,418
- 5! - 5!

612
00:22:15,419 --> 00:22:18,046
(It's 5 points.)

613
00:22:19,790 --> 00:22:21,318
(They receive 5 points from the start.)

614
00:22:21,319 --> 00:22:22,789
- Jong Kook! - Five points!

615
00:22:22,790 --> 00:22:24,558
(He's surely amazing.)

616
00:22:24,559 --> 00:22:26,229
- Should we stop here? - You're amazing.

617
00:22:26,230 --> 00:22:27,658
- That'll be boring. - You should continue.

618
00:22:27,659 --> 00:22:29,558
- Be a man. - Come on.

619
00:22:29,559 --> 00:22:30,882
Shall we just stop here?

620
00:22:31,669 --> 00:22:33,549
If it were up to me, I'd just stop here.

621
00:22:33,599 --> 00:22:34,969
You should go on.

622
00:22:34,970 --> 00:22:36,868
- Let's do four. - What?

623
00:22:36,869 --> 00:22:39,269
- Let's try it. - I don't think that's right.

624
00:22:39,270 --> 00:22:40,908
Just once more. Let's pick the first one.

625
00:22:40,909 --> 00:22:43,263
- You should continue. - First one.

626
00:22:43,309 --> 00:22:44,764
- First one. - Go on.

627
00:22:44,980 --> 00:22:46,549
- You shouldn't stop here. - Go on.

628
00:22:46,550 --> 00:22:47,549
I pick eight.

629
00:22:47,550 --> 00:22:48,618
- Open it. - Go!

630
00:22:48,619 --> 00:22:50,366
(He continues.)

631
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:52,148
- All right. - Let's go!

632
00:22:52,149 --> 00:22:53,818
- Please. - All right.

633
00:22:53,819 --> 00:22:55,959
- Open it. - I think this one's not right.

634
00:22:55,960 --> 00:22:57,828
He already picked this one.

635
00:22:57,829 --> 00:23:00,229
Dud, dud, dud.ud

636
00:23:00,230 --> 00:23:02,987
(Is it a dud, or will they get points?)

637
00:23:03,930 --> 00:23:08,039
(Will he make the right choice once again?)

638
00:23:08,040 --> 00:23:09,857
- Dud! - Dud!

639
00:23:11,270 --> 00:23:12,308
- Dud! - Dud!

640
00:23:12,309 --> 00:23:16,739
(It's a dud, and their previous 5 points don't count.)

641
00:23:16,740 --> 00:23:19,235
- It's a dud - It's a dud

642
00:23:19,280 --> 00:23:20,420
I knew it.

643
00:23:20,819 --> 00:23:23,204
- I knew it. - How could it be a dud?

644
00:23:23,579 --> 00:23:24,648
I wanted to pick seven.

645
00:23:24,649 --> 00:23:26,918
- I wanted to pick one. - We should know when to stop.

646
00:23:26,919 --> 00:23:28,058
We learned a lesson.

647
00:23:28,059 --> 00:23:29,358
- Okay. - Okay.

648
00:23:29,359 --> 00:23:30,618
(Jong Kook shares his lesson,)

649
00:23:30,619 --> 00:23:31,759
(and Se Chan listens to him.)

650
00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:33,043
We learned a lesson.

651
00:23:33,089 --> 00:23:34,999
- We did. - You're so positive.

652
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:36,999
- You sound so generous. - I am.

653
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:38,299
Stop pretending.

654
00:23:38,300 --> 00:23:39,542
I learned a lesson.

655
00:23:39,730 --> 00:23:41,269
Let's win this time.

656
00:23:41,270 --> 00:23:42,957
Here's the second question.

657
00:23:43,240 --> 00:23:47,138
Which of these mountains doesn't exist in Korea?

658
00:23:47,139 --> 00:23:48,896
- All right. - I'm confident.

659
00:23:49,309 --> 00:23:51,734
One, "Mount Woo".

660
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:53,979
- One, "Mount Woo". - That's a mountain?

661
00:23:53,980 --> 00:23:55,332
- Mount Woo? - What?

662
00:23:55,450 --> 00:23:57,118
- Two... - Is this nonsensical?

663
00:23:57,119 --> 00:23:58,118
(He asks about the question.)

664
00:23:58,119 --> 00:23:59,148
No, no.

665
00:23:59,149 --> 00:24:01,411
- He said, "Mount Woo". - It must be a mountain.

666
00:24:01,419 --> 00:24:02,570
- No? - Okay.

667
00:24:03,619 --> 00:24:05,851
- I'm sorry. - I think it's number one.

668
00:24:06,159 --> 00:24:07,644
How does "Mount Woo" make sense?

669
00:24:08,099 --> 00:24:09,877
Two, "Mount Ttan".

670
00:24:10,099 --> 00:24:11,128
- What? - "Mount Ttan"?

671
00:24:11,129 --> 00:24:12,429
- "Mount Ttan"? - Come on.

672
00:24:12,430 --> 00:24:14,218
- This is nonsensical, right? - How can we pick one?

673
00:24:14,869 --> 00:24:17,299
- I don't get this. - They want us to guess.

674
00:24:17,300 --> 00:24:18,482
"Mount Meon".

675
00:24:18,740 --> 00:24:20,439
Let me answer.

676
00:24:20,440 --> 00:24:21,908
(Seok Jin attempts to answer.)

677
00:24:21,909 --> 00:24:23,193
Three, "Mount Meon".

678
00:24:23,309 --> 00:24:25,167
- 1 more time, please? - 3, "Mount Meon".

679
00:24:26,109 --> 00:24:27,119
"Mount Meon".

680
00:24:27,720 --> 00:24:30,148
(They get it right.)

681
00:24:30,149 --> 00:24:31,401
You're amazing.

682
00:24:32,050 --> 00:24:33,332
- He's amazing. - "Mount Meon"!

683
00:24:33,389 --> 00:24:34,471
He's amazing.

684
00:24:35,460 --> 00:24:36,789
(Hitting)

685
00:24:36,790 --> 00:24:37,839
Why are you hitting us?

686
00:24:38,589 --> 00:24:40,759
(He surprises them.)

687
00:24:40,760 --> 00:24:41,898
- Why did you hit me? - Why?

688
00:24:41,899 --> 00:24:43,358
- Why did he? - What?

689
00:24:43,359 --> 00:24:44,799
- What? - He need to get hit.

690
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:46,799
- You should get hit too. - Why?

691
00:24:46,800 --> 00:24:48,719
- Why did you hit us? - No.

692
00:24:48,970 --> 00:24:50,338
- Is he insane? - Come on.

693
00:24:50,339 --> 00:24:51,908
- I was just happy. - Why?

694
00:24:51,909 --> 00:24:53,838
- He needs to be hit. - Why did you hit them?

695
00:24:53,839 --> 00:24:55,439
- What's going on? - Why did you?

696
00:24:55,440 --> 00:24:56,638
- I'm not sure. - Hit him.

697
00:24:56,639 --> 00:24:57,908
- Just hit him. - I blocked it.

698
00:24:57,909 --> 00:24:59,808
- Hey, you should help me. - Let's take turns.

699
00:24:59,809 --> 00:25:00,949
- I blocked it. - Why did you hit us?

700
00:25:00,950 --> 00:25:02,679
- I was just happy. - Why did you do that?

701
00:25:02,680 --> 00:25:04,989
- I didn't mean to. - Be still.

702
00:25:04,990 --> 00:25:07,289
(He takes off Seok Jin's hat and glasses.)

703
00:25:07,290 --> 00:25:08,632
- Be still. - What?

704
00:25:08,690 --> 00:25:09,730
Be still.

705
00:25:09,790 --> 00:25:10,941
- Why? - I'm so confused.

706
00:25:11,290 --> 00:25:12,388
- Why did you do it? - Why?

707
00:25:12,389 --> 00:25:14,006
(Hitting)

708
00:25:14,530 --> 00:25:15,670
- Why? - Why?

709
00:25:15,800 --> 00:25:17,969
(He regrets his actions.)

710
00:25:17,970 --> 00:25:20,769
(It hurts him a lot.)

711
00:25:20,770 --> 00:25:21,910
Goodness.

712
00:25:22,099 --> 00:25:23,685
- It's give and take. - Hey.

713
00:25:23,899 --> 00:25:25,539
- You don't usually hit him. - I was...

714
00:25:25,540 --> 00:25:27,039
- I was just happy. - You don't usually do that.

715
00:25:27,040 --> 00:25:28,209
- I was happy. - You were?

716
00:25:28,210 --> 00:25:29,509
I thought you're supposed to hit when you're happy.

717
00:25:29,510 --> 00:25:30,779
- Okay. - I see.

718
00:25:30,780 --> 00:25:31,979
Hey, hit me.

719
00:25:31,980 --> 00:25:34,049
- Hit me. - Okay.

720
00:25:34,050 --> 00:25:35,049
One more left.

721
00:25:35,050 --> 00:25:36,479
(It's Kwang Soo's turn.)

722
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:38,549
(He hits him with the handle.)

723
00:25:38,550 --> 00:25:39,599
Oh, my.

724
00:25:40,419 --> 00:25:41,470
Why?

725
00:25:42,419 --> 00:25:44,828
(A dull sound was heard.)

726
00:25:44,829 --> 00:25:45,839
Goodness.

727
00:25:46,260 --> 00:25:48,653
I was so happy that I wanted to hit you with the handle.

728
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:50,678
- Okay. - I can't believe you.

729
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:52,229
Okay.

730
00:25:52,230 --> 00:25:54,269
- Why do I feel defeated? - Gosh.

731
00:25:54,270 --> 00:25:55,469
(They were the ones who got the question right.)

732
00:25:55,470 --> 00:25:56,868
My goodness.

733
00:25:56,869 --> 00:25:58,889
- I'm confused. - I was so shocked.

734
00:25:59,109 --> 00:26:00,709
I was just so happy.

735
00:26:00,710 --> 00:26:02,908
All right. Pick a dud for us.

736
00:26:02,909 --> 00:26:04,239
- All right. - All right.

737
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:05,808
I'm sure there will be a dud.

738
00:26:05,809 --> 00:26:06,908
I'll go since I got it right.

739
00:26:06,909 --> 00:26:08,496
Go with eight.

740
00:26:08,950 --> 00:26:10,279
- Pick eight. - Stay still.

741
00:26:10,280 --> 00:26:11,719
- There can't be consecutive duds. - Stay still.

742
00:26:11,720 --> 00:26:13,118
- Right. - Let Ji Hyo pick.

743
00:26:13,119 --> 00:26:15,519
Let her pick. Go.

744
00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:17,058
Are you the team leader?

745
00:26:17,059 --> 00:26:20,060
(Who are you to tell us what to do?)

746
00:26:20,159 --> 00:26:22,628
- You're not one either. - I know but...

747
00:26:22,629 --> 00:26:23,898
Ji Hyo should go.

748
00:26:23,899 --> 00:26:26,699
Do you think being nice to her will make her pick you?

749
00:26:26,700 --> 00:26:27,739
(I know your intentions.)

750
00:26:27,740 --> 00:26:28,838
You knew, didn't you?

751
00:26:28,839 --> 00:26:31,435
- He's so sly. - What is he?

752
00:26:31,540 --> 00:26:33,439
Ji Hyo, please pick.

753
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:36,238
If it's another dud, that'll be baffling.

754
00:26:36,409 --> 00:26:37,591
Let's play it safe.

755
00:26:37,639 --> 00:26:39,195
- Let's be safe. - Then...

756
00:26:39,250 --> 00:26:40,348
- I pick eight. - Okay!

757
00:26:40,349 --> 00:26:41,618
- Okay. - It won't be a dud.

758
00:26:41,619 --> 00:26:43,297
(Ji Hyo picks 8.)

759
00:26:43,950 --> 00:26:45,388
- I pick eight. - Open it.

760
00:26:45,389 --> 00:26:46,989
(Previously, 8 was a dud.)

761
00:26:46,990 --> 00:26:52,918
(Will Ji Hyo's prediction be correct?)

762
00:26:54,129 --> 00:26:56,558
(3 points)

763
00:26:56,559 --> 00:26:58,269
- All right. - Great start.

764
00:26:58,270 --> 00:27:00,825
- Let's go again. - All right.

765
00:27:01,240 --> 00:27:03,168
I want to stop here.

766
00:27:03,169 --> 00:27:04,269
(She's careful.)

767
00:27:04,270 --> 00:27:05,608
Let's do it.

768
00:27:05,609 --> 00:27:07,408
- Let's try one more time. - Wait.

769
00:27:07,409 --> 00:27:08,709
Let's go with eight once more!

770
00:27:08,710 --> 00:27:10,009
- Wait. - Pick eight again!

771
00:27:10,010 --> 00:27:12,679
- Ask her. - Ji Hyo, just go with it.

772
00:27:12,680 --> 00:27:13,779
- Let's not go with eight. - Wait.

773
00:27:13,780 --> 00:27:15,637
- Ji Hyo. - Are you the leader?

774
00:27:15,750 --> 00:27:16,962
- Go. - Ji Hyo.

775
00:27:17,790 --> 00:27:18,818
- Go! - Go.

776
00:27:18,819 --> 00:27:20,118
Let's go with eight.

777
00:27:20,119 --> 00:27:21,219
- Go! - Go.

778
00:27:21,220 --> 00:27:22,219
Let's go with eight.

779
00:27:22,220 --> 00:27:25,959
(Will they receive points once more?)

780
00:27:25,960 --> 00:27:30,658
(Will Jae Seok's choice make Ji Hyo smile?)

781
00:27:30,659 --> 00:27:33,328
(It's a dud.)

782
00:27:33,329 --> 00:27:34,838
- Okay! - Okay!

783
00:27:34,839 --> 00:27:38,009
(They forgot how unlucky Jae Seok is.)

784
00:27:38,010 --> 00:27:39,757
How could that happen?

785
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:41,592
There were 2 duds for 1 number.

786
00:27:42,040 --> 00:27:43,939
That means the rest of the cups...

787
00:27:43,940 --> 00:27:45,348
- They're safe. - are safe.

788
00:27:45,349 --> 00:27:47,279
- It's safe. - Right.

789
00:27:47,280 --> 00:27:48,949
- Let's pick that number. - We have to win.

790
00:27:48,950 --> 00:27:50,061
- We have to. - We must.

791
00:27:50,450 --> 00:27:51,719
- All right then. - Let's go.

792
00:27:51,720 --> 00:27:53,318
- We must see to it. - All right.

793
00:27:53,319 --> 00:27:54,558
- Go. - There are two duds.

794
00:27:54,559 --> 00:27:55,719
Number eight is a jackpot.

795
00:27:55,720 --> 00:27:57,058
Darn you all.

796
00:27:57,059 --> 00:27:58,099
Let's go.

797
00:27:58,230 --> 00:28:00,048
- We must get this one right. - We have to.

798
00:28:00,129 --> 00:28:01,746
- All right. - Third question.

799
00:28:02,129 --> 00:28:07,281
What is the word that refers to bluffers and liars?

800
00:28:09,069 --> 00:28:10,150
Lee Kwang Soo.

801
00:28:10,240 --> 00:28:11,987
Which number is it?

802
00:28:12,809 --> 00:28:13,908
It's right?

803
00:28:13,909 --> 00:28:16,001
(He was just guessing.)

804
00:28:17,010 --> 00:28:18,625
- I'm in the choices? - Hold on.

805
00:28:18,980 --> 00:28:20,378
- I'm not a bluffer. - It's in there?

806
00:28:20,379 --> 00:28:21,418
It is in here.

807
00:28:21,419 --> 00:28:22,949
Really? Truly?

808
00:28:22,950 --> 00:28:24,719
- That's the answer. - That's great.

809
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:26,033
- I'm in there? - Great.

810
00:28:26,220 --> 00:28:29,623
- One, "large-eyed herring". - That's wrong.

811
00:28:29,720 --> 00:28:31,789
Two, "Lee Kwang Soo".

812
00:28:31,790 --> 00:28:33,558
(He was really a part of it.)

813
00:28:33,559 --> 00:28:35,317
- Lee Kwang Soo? - He's really a part of it.

814
00:28:35,559 --> 00:28:36,872
I come after large-eyed herring?

815
00:28:37,460 --> 00:28:39,828
- He was in the choices. - He was.

816
00:28:39,829 --> 00:28:40,879
Yes.

817
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:42,499
Three, "a street singer".

818
00:28:42,500 --> 00:28:43,568
- Let me answer! - Let me answer!

819
00:28:43,569 --> 00:28:44,680
- No, no. - That's right.

820
00:28:44,740 --> 00:28:45,739
- Let me answer. - That's right.

821
00:28:45,740 --> 00:28:46,769
Three, "a street singer".

822
00:28:46,770 --> 00:28:48,539
(He is sure.)

823
00:28:48,540 --> 00:28:49,779
Isn't it right?

824
00:28:49,780 --> 00:28:52,908
(They change their answer.)

825
00:28:52,909 --> 00:28:54,719
- It's number four then. - I think it is.

826
00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:56,163
Use the toy hammer.

827
00:28:57,020 --> 00:28:59,388
Jong Kook, let's just hit Seok Jin.

828
00:28:59,389 --> 00:29:02,016
(Let's do the same thing he did.)

829
00:29:04,119 --> 00:29:06,628
- Seok Jin? - Hit the one who got it wrong.

830
00:29:06,629 --> 00:29:09,083
- If you don't care, I'll pick one. - What?

831
00:29:10,359 --> 00:29:11,368
Okay, they don't care.

832
00:29:11,369 --> 00:29:12,682
- Okay. - What?

833
00:29:14,740 --> 00:29:15,880
They don't care.

834
00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:18,368
(If they don't care, it'll be Seok Jin.)

835
00:29:18,369 --> 00:29:20,269
- Why me? - They don't care.

836
00:29:20,270 --> 00:29:22,199
- Hey. Stay still. - We pick you.

837
00:29:22,339 --> 00:29:23,808
- Wait a minute. - Why?

838
00:29:23,809 --> 00:29:25,549
- Aren't you afraid? - They said...

839
00:29:25,550 --> 00:29:27,979
- they don't care. - It doesn't matter.

840
00:29:27,980 --> 00:29:29,130
Hit him.

841
00:29:29,379 --> 00:29:33,156
I'll hit lighter than before.

842
00:29:33,450 --> 00:29:34,519
(Everyone pities him.)

843
00:29:34,520 --> 00:29:35,888
It's lighter, right?

844
00:29:35,889 --> 00:29:37,189
(They shouldn't get them wrong anymore.)

845
00:29:37,190 --> 00:29:38,459
(What is the word that refers to bluffers and liars?)

846
00:29:38,460 --> 00:29:40,529
- Four, "big talker". - Let me answer.

847
00:29:40,530 --> 00:29:42,699
(Kwang Soo was quick.)

848
00:29:42,700 --> 00:29:44,358
- Kwang Soo. - It's the last one.

849
00:29:44,359 --> 00:29:47,126
(Jong Kook thinks it's the last one.)

850
00:29:48,369 --> 00:29:52,808
(If they get it right, they'll receive 7 points.)

851
00:29:52,809 --> 00:29:54,039
One, "large-eyed herring".

852
00:29:54,040 --> 00:29:55,539
- What? Hey. - What?

853
00:29:55,540 --> 00:29:56,709
(All of a sudden?)

854
00:29:56,710 --> 00:29:59,982
- What? What are you doing? - Wait.

855
00:30:00,109 --> 00:30:01,179
What are you doing?

856
00:30:01,180 --> 00:30:02,219
- Let me answer. - Let me answer.

857
00:30:02,220 --> 00:30:04,573
- Let me answer. - Four, "big talker".

858
00:30:04,790 --> 00:30:06,219
- It's number four. - Okay!

859
00:30:06,220 --> 00:30:07,789
(The answer is "big talker".)

860
00:30:07,790 --> 00:30:09,405
We need to hit him.

861
00:30:09,460 --> 00:30:11,308
Hold on. One person from our team will...

862
00:30:12,129 --> 00:30:13,604
(He suddenly pops up and hits him.)

863
00:30:14,290 --> 00:30:15,999
(Fly like a butterfly and sting...)

864
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:17,558
(like a bee.)

865
00:30:17,559 --> 00:30:20,328
- Is this how it's going to be? - What? You lost.

866
00:30:20,329 --> 00:30:21,481
What's wrong with you?

867
00:30:21,899 --> 00:30:23,353
- What's wrong with you? - Why did you do that?

868
00:30:23,470 --> 00:30:25,469
- I didn't think it was number four. - Me neither.

869
00:30:25,470 --> 00:30:26,769
- It was right. - It was.

870
00:30:26,770 --> 00:30:27,769
- I thought it wasn't right. - It's not number one.

871
00:30:27,770 --> 00:30:29,627
- It was the right one. - Why did you hit me?

872
00:30:29,909 --> 00:30:31,679
(Why did he hit him?)

873
00:30:31,680 --> 00:30:33,164
- I need to hit 4 people? - 4?

874
00:30:33,950 --> 00:30:35,979
- He needs to hit four people. - I do.

875
00:30:35,980 --> 00:30:38,148
(Really?)

876
00:30:38,149 --> 00:30:40,118
- No, I need to hit 3 people. - No, it's 4.

877
00:30:40,119 --> 00:30:41,118
Wait.

878
00:30:41,119 --> 00:30:42,689
(He quickly changes the rules.)

879
00:30:42,690 --> 00:30:43,959
(He doesn't dare to hit Jong Kook.)

880
00:30:43,960 --> 00:30:45,729
- Wait, you changed it. - Hold on.

881
00:30:45,730 --> 00:30:47,345
- Hold on. - I want to hit him.

882
00:30:47,460 --> 00:30:49,098
- It's 4. - No, it's 3.

883
00:30:49,099 --> 00:30:51,269
- No, it's not. - It's three people.

884
00:30:51,270 --> 00:30:52,512
- What do you mean? - Don't be ridiculous.

885
00:30:52,569 --> 00:30:54,098
- It's 4 people. - It's 3 people.

886
00:30:54,099 --> 00:30:55,439
Forget it. It's three.

887
00:30:55,440 --> 00:30:56,999
- It's 4. - No, it's 3.

888
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:58,368
- No, it's 4. - No, I want 3.

889
00:30:58,369 --> 00:31:00,908
- Just make it four. - I don't want to.

890
00:31:00,909 --> 00:31:02,638
(He dodges it.)

891
00:31:02,639 --> 00:31:04,279
- He dodged it. - Let it go.

892
00:31:04,280 --> 00:31:05,319
Let it go.

893
00:31:06,409 --> 00:31:08,873
- Let it go. - He dodged it? Gosh.

894
00:31:09,379 --> 00:31:10,461
Fine, then.

895
00:31:10,619 --> 00:31:13,174
Did you see Seok Jin?

896
00:31:13,290 --> 00:31:14,289
He was afraid he'd get hit.

897
00:31:14,290 --> 00:31:16,489
(He surrendered.)

898
00:31:16,490 --> 00:31:18,580
- Okay, then. - That was hilarious.

899
00:31:18,790 --> 00:31:20,547
- Let's go with eight. - All right.

900
00:31:20,589 --> 00:31:22,346
- We choose 8. - 8, it is.

901
00:31:22,559 --> 00:31:24,158
- Shall we do both cups? - Sure.

902
00:31:24,159 --> 00:31:26,251
- Should I go? - There's no dud there.

903
00:31:26,300 --> 00:31:27,628
- Okay. - Yes!

904
00:31:27,629 --> 00:31:28,751
- Go! - Go!

905
00:31:28,940 --> 00:31:30,598
- It's a given. - Okay!

906
00:31:30,599 --> 00:31:31,769
- Six points. - Go?

907
00:31:31,770 --> 00:31:32,819
- Go! - Go!

908
00:31:33,540 --> 00:31:34,923
- Okay! - Yes!

909
00:31:35,740 --> 00:31:37,439
- Seven points. - Let's do one more.

910
00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:39,108
- Let's do one more. - Sure.

911
00:31:39,109 --> 00:31:40,209
- Let's go. - That's enough.

912
00:31:40,210 --> 00:31:42,019
- Let's go. - Calm down.

913
00:31:42,020 --> 00:31:43,648
Ji Hyo, let's go once more.

914
00:31:43,649 --> 00:31:45,719
- We should continue. - We should stop.

915
00:31:45,720 --> 00:31:46,749
- Let's go. - Let's stop.

916
00:31:46,750 --> 00:31:48,088
- You're the team leader. - Let's continue.

917
00:31:48,089 --> 00:31:49,858
- Don't forget that. - Go on.

918
00:31:49,859 --> 00:31:51,588
- Ji Hyo. - Let's go.

919
00:31:51,589 --> 00:31:52,888
- 9. - 9.

920
00:31:52,889 --> 00:31:54,628
- Okay. - If we get more points,

921
00:31:54,629 --> 00:31:56,259
- let's stop here. - Okay.

922
00:31:56,260 --> 00:31:57,858
- 1, 2, 3. - It must be 8 points.

923
00:31:57,859 --> 00:31:59,111
(Ji Hyo, who's always lucky, decides to continue.)

924
00:32:00,030 --> 00:32:02,423
(They wish for it to be a dud.)

925
00:32:03,169 --> 00:32:07,179
(Did she make the right choice?)

926
00:32:07,569 --> 00:32:09,196
- Okay. - What a relief.

927
00:32:09,280 --> 00:32:11,209
(They receive 1 more point.)

928
00:32:11,210 --> 00:32:12,967
- We got a point. - Let's do one more.

929
00:32:13,480 --> 00:32:15,166
- They've picked seven. - Last pick.

930
00:32:15,220 --> 00:32:16,479
- Okay, seven. - This will be our last one.

931
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:18,066
- Are you sure? - Seven.

932
00:32:18,119 --> 00:32:19,888
- Let's do it. It'll be all right. - 1, 2...

933
00:32:19,889 --> 00:32:20,899
1, 2, 3.

934
00:32:21,690 --> 00:32:24,388
(No one has picked 7 before.)

935
00:32:24,389 --> 00:32:28,399
(Will it be a lucky 7 or a tragic 7?)

936
00:32:28,800 --> 00:32:30,199
- 1, 2, 3. - Okay!

937
00:32:30,200 --> 00:32:31,199
- Let's stop here. - Let's stop.

938
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:32,583
- Great. - Amazing.

939
00:32:32,700 --> 00:32:34,215
- This is amazing. - 1, 2, 3.

940
00:32:34,869 --> 00:32:37,338
(Team Ace gets 10 points.)

941
00:32:37,339 --> 00:32:39,157
- Stop it. I'm so anxious. - All right.

942
00:32:39,770 --> 00:32:40,819
- 10 points. - 10 points.

943
00:32:41,109 --> 00:32:43,029
Look at what you've done.

944
00:32:43,579 --> 00:32:45,529
- What have you done? - We received 10 points.

945
00:32:45,780 --> 00:32:47,449
We could've gotten it.

946
00:32:47,450 --> 00:32:49,318
- Of course, it was number four. - He's telling him off.

947
00:32:49,319 --> 00:32:51,918
- Stop. - Fine. What's done is done.

948
00:32:51,919 --> 00:32:53,536
Sit down, Kwang Soo. Let's do this.

949
00:32:53,589 --> 00:32:54,802
Next question.

950
00:32:55,559 --> 00:32:58,358
The difference in 12 years of age is called zodiac similarity.

951
00:32:58,359 --> 00:32:59,844
- Right. - Correct.

952
00:32:59,889 --> 00:33:03,091
Then what's the word for...

953
00:33:03,329 --> 00:33:04,729
- one-year difference? - I know this one.

954
00:33:04,730 --> 00:33:06,245
- I know this. - This one's easy.

955
00:33:06,700 --> 00:33:08,962
One, "knee similarity".

956
00:33:09,569 --> 00:33:11,629
Two, "shoulder similarity".

957
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:14,230
Three, "eyebrow similarity".

958
00:33:14,470 --> 00:33:16,078
Four, "head similarity".

959
00:33:16,079 --> 00:33:17,422
Let me answer!

960
00:33:18,550 --> 00:33:20,709
(Hesitant, Haha raises his hand.)

961
00:33:20,710 --> 00:33:21,730
What is the answer?

962
00:33:22,280 --> 00:33:23,979
- What? - Don't you know everything?

963
00:33:23,980 --> 00:33:26,749
- I'm not sure. Maybe three? - I don't know either.

964
00:33:26,750 --> 00:33:31,358
I think it's either eyebrow or ankle. Let's do eyebrow.

965
00:33:31,359 --> 00:33:32,929
- There was no ankle. - It's knee.

966
00:33:32,930 --> 00:33:34,558
- It's knee. - There was no ankle.

967
00:33:34,559 --> 00:33:36,098
- I'm baffled. - That's like a ghost.

968
00:33:36,099 --> 00:33:38,726
There's no ankle. Four was "head similarity".

969
00:33:38,930 --> 00:33:40,990
- Pick 3. - 3, "eyebrow similarity".

970
00:33:41,770 --> 00:33:42,810
That's the right one.

971
00:33:43,569 --> 00:33:44,769
- Let me answer! - Let me answer!

972
00:33:44,770 --> 00:33:46,209
We need to hit them first.

973
00:33:46,210 --> 00:33:47,209
- Hit them. - Do that first.

974
00:33:47,210 --> 00:33:48,623
You should do it.

975
00:33:48,680 --> 00:33:49,751
Give it back later.

976
00:33:49,940 --> 00:33:51,648
(Who is his target?)

977
00:33:51,649 --> 00:33:53,249
What was the second choice?

978
00:33:53,250 --> 00:33:54,865
(He finds his target.)

979
00:33:56,319 --> 00:33:57,648
- Come on. - What do you mean?

980
00:33:57,649 --> 00:33:59,549
- Take off your hat. - Oh, okay.

981
00:33:59,550 --> 00:34:02,247
(He makes sure to teach him a lesson.)

982
00:34:03,490 --> 00:34:04,789
(Hitting)

983
00:34:04,790 --> 00:34:06,759
- Wait. - What's wrong?

984
00:34:06,760 --> 00:34:09,658
(Why is he hitting me?)

985
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:12,199
- Jong Kook! - What's going on?

986
00:34:12,200 --> 00:34:13,898
- Jae Seok! - What?

987
00:34:13,899 --> 00:34:15,268
- What was that? - What did you do?

988
00:34:15,269 --> 00:34:16,699
- What? - Why did you hit me?

989
00:34:16,700 --> 00:34:18,409
- How could you do that? - What's wrong?

990
00:34:18,410 --> 00:34:19,581
You're impossible.

991
00:34:19,640 --> 00:34:21,285
- He hit me! - Hey.

992
00:34:21,339 --> 00:34:23,228
- How could you? - It's not him.

993
00:34:23,379 --> 00:34:24,621
- How could you? - Wait.

994
00:34:24,810 --> 00:34:26,349
(While walking towards Jae Seok,)

995
00:34:26,350 --> 00:34:27,378
(Jong Kook makes an abrupt turn.)

996
00:34:27,379 --> 00:34:29,248
- It's not him. - How could you?

997
00:34:29,249 --> 00:34:31,018
(When a junior makes a mistake, his senior should take the blame.)

998
00:34:31,019 --> 00:34:33,119
- How many more hits? One? - Wait.

999
00:34:33,120 --> 00:34:34,977
- What's going on? - Okay.

1000
00:34:35,260 --> 00:34:36,918
- How could you do this? - Hey.

1001
00:34:36,919 --> 00:34:37,918
Goodness.

1002
00:34:37,919 --> 00:34:39,788
(He's been hit 5 times today.)

1003
00:34:39,789 --> 00:34:41,029
You won't get away with this!

1004
00:34:41,030 --> 00:34:43,080
(You should respect me.)

1005
00:34:43,200 --> 00:34:45,452
(What?)

1006
00:34:46,569 --> 00:34:48,029
How could you?

1007
00:34:48,030 --> 00:34:49,469
(He places his glasses upside down.)

1008
00:34:49,470 --> 00:34:51,055
How could you?

1009
00:34:51,140 --> 00:34:53,168
- Okay. - You've changed your glasses.

1010
00:34:53,169 --> 00:34:55,160
- All right. - You changed your style.

1011
00:34:55,510 --> 00:34:57,579
Let me hit him next.

1012
00:34:57,580 --> 00:34:59,327
- Sure, you can. - Let me answer.

1013
00:34:59,379 --> 00:35:00,478
- Let me answer. - All right.

1014
00:35:00,479 --> 00:35:03,076
- Two, "shoulder similarity". - "Shoulder similarity".

1015
00:35:04,280 --> 00:35:05,299
Okay!

1016
00:35:05,890 --> 00:35:07,219
It was the shoulder.

1017
00:35:07,220 --> 00:35:08,835
My brother and I are one-year apart.

1018
00:35:09,060 --> 00:35:11,585
- Because they're of similar height. - I get it.

1019
00:35:11,830 --> 00:35:13,951
They got 10 points. We have to get this.

1020
00:35:14,430 --> 00:35:15,641
You won't have our luck.

1021
00:35:15,700 --> 00:35:17,898
- Please. Pick 2. - We got 10 points.

1022
00:35:17,899 --> 00:35:19,498
- I think it's 4. - No, it's 2.

1023
00:35:19,499 --> 00:35:21,014
- I think... - I think it's two.

1024
00:35:21,069 --> 00:35:22,838
Was this the one they picked?

1025
00:35:22,839 --> 00:35:24,909
Yes, it's seven. Should we pick that...

1026
00:35:24,910 --> 00:35:26,758
- and then pick another one? - I think we can pick that one.

1027
00:35:26,870 --> 00:35:29,179
- I don't think it'll be a dud. - Me neither.

1028
00:35:29,180 --> 00:35:30,594
It has to be a dud.

1029
00:35:31,180 --> 00:35:32,765
The second one can't be a dud.

1030
00:35:33,479 --> 00:35:34,489
What do you think?

1031
00:35:34,709 --> 00:35:36,219
Let's trust Se Chan.

1032
00:35:36,220 --> 00:35:38,788
- 7. - We'll open 7.

1033
00:35:38,789 --> 00:35:40,668
I doubt it'll be a dud.

1034
00:35:41,890 --> 00:35:42,889
- It's a dud. - It's a dud.

1035
00:35:42,890 --> 00:35:46,465
(Team Champion needs to catch up.)

1036
00:35:46,490 --> 00:35:49,599
(Will they be able to avoid the dud?)

1037
00:35:49,600 --> 00:35:50,799
- Okay! - Okay!

1038
00:35:50,800 --> 00:35:53,224
(They receive 3 points.)

1039
00:35:53,930 --> 00:35:54,938
(Let's catch up now.)

1040
00:35:54,939 --> 00:35:56,239
- Let's continue. - It'll work out.

1041
00:35:56,240 --> 00:35:57,715
- Let's do 4. - Let's do 2.

1042
00:35:57,899 --> 00:35:59,509
- Let's do 4. - I'm not sure about 4.

1043
00:35:59,510 --> 00:36:01,156
- We should pick 2. - 2?

1044
00:36:01,470 --> 00:36:02,579
It won't be a dud from the start.

1045
00:36:02,580 --> 00:36:04,949
- Did you pick four? - Hold on.

1046
00:36:04,950 --> 00:36:07,879
Jae Seok touched the fourth one.

1047
00:36:08,379 --> 00:36:10,779
And Kwang Soo also wanted to pick four.

1048
00:36:10,780 --> 00:36:12,288
- Right. - Jae Seok touched it.

1049
00:36:12,289 --> 00:36:14,774
(4 seems ominous.)

1050
00:36:15,490 --> 00:36:17,559
It does feel like you shouldn't pick that one.

1051
00:36:17,560 --> 00:36:19,075
They both wanted four.

1052
00:36:19,959 --> 00:36:21,489
I'm not sure.

1053
00:36:21,490 --> 00:36:22,741
- Wait. - Okay.

1054
00:36:22,959 --> 00:36:24,898
We listened to Se Chan and picked seven.

1055
00:36:24,899 --> 00:36:26,141
- So pick yours. - I'll...

1056
00:36:26,269 --> 00:36:27,987
- I'll pick four. - All right, then.

1057
00:36:28,200 --> 00:36:29,916
- It feels ominous. - 2, 3.

1058
00:36:30,370 --> 00:36:33,068
(Cup number 4 is the one Jae Seok touched...)

1059
00:36:33,069 --> 00:36:36,412
(and Kwang Soo picked.)

1060
00:36:37,479 --> 00:36:39,279
(Will this go against their expectations?)

1061
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:43,896
(Will it give them points instead of a dud?)

1062
00:36:46,089 --> 00:36:48,887
- Dud! - It's like a miracle.

1063
00:36:49,319 --> 00:36:50,369
I can't believe this.

1064
00:36:50,819 --> 00:36:54,426
(Just like Kwang Soo, the cup turns out to be a dud.)

1065
00:36:54,629 --> 00:36:56,347
- It's a dud. - I'm sorry.

1066
00:36:56,359 --> 00:36:57,599
(He regrets believing in him.)

1067
00:36:57,600 --> 00:36:59,628
- I'm sorry. - You should've listened to me.

1068
00:36:59,629 --> 00:37:00,929
- It's over. - I'm sorry.

1069
00:37:00,930 --> 00:37:03,568
- I can't believe this. - This is impossible.

1070
00:37:03,569 --> 00:37:05,708
- How could that happen? - My goodness.

1071
00:37:05,709 --> 00:37:07,608
(None of them can believe it.)

1072
00:37:07,609 --> 00:37:09,079
- You know what? - It's so strange.

1073
00:37:09,080 --> 00:37:11,433
- I picked four as well. - How could this happen?

1074
00:37:11,979 --> 00:37:13,978
- I picked four as well. - Unbelievable.

1075
00:37:13,979 --> 00:37:15,748
- It really is. - Goodness.

1076
00:37:15,749 --> 00:37:18,588
- It's amazing. - I know.

1077
00:37:18,589 --> 00:37:20,489
- I can't believe this. - Me neither.

1078
00:37:20,490 --> 00:37:23,086
- It's all over. - How could this be?

1079
00:37:23,189 --> 00:37:25,389
- Okay, it's good for us. - That's why it didn't work out.

1080
00:37:25,390 --> 00:37:26,803
(They fail to gain any points.)

1081
00:37:27,229 --> 00:37:28,998
They have no points, right?

1082
00:37:28,999 --> 00:37:30,398
(Team Ace: 10, Team Champion: 0)

1083
00:37:30,399 --> 00:37:32,898
- We'll try harder next time. - It'll still be hard.

1084
00:37:32,899 --> 00:37:35,268
Those who frequent the US will have an advantageous.

1085
00:37:35,269 --> 00:37:36,987
- Okay. - That's good.

1086
00:37:36,999 --> 00:37:38,469
Who knows?

1087
00:37:38,470 --> 00:37:41,978
Whose face appears on the front side...

1088
00:37:41,979 --> 00:37:44,579
- of a one-dollar bill? - I know this.

1089
00:37:44,580 --> 00:37:46,779
One, "Abraham Lincoln".

1090
00:37:46,780 --> 00:37:48,719
Two, "Thomas Jefferson".

1091
00:37:48,720 --> 00:37:51,788
Three, "Franklin Delano Roosevelt".

1092
00:37:51,789 --> 00:37:53,049
Four, "George Washington".

1093
00:37:53,050 --> 00:37:54,619
- Let me answer! - Let me answer!

1094
00:37:54,620 --> 00:37:56,389
- Jae Seok. - Four, "George Washington".

1095
00:37:56,390 --> 00:37:57,688
I'm sure.

1096
00:37:57,689 --> 00:37:59,259
- I'm 100-percent sure. - Isn't it Abraham Lincoln?

1097
00:37:59,260 --> 00:38:01,059
No, it's George Washington.

1098
00:38:01,060 --> 00:38:02,259
(What is the answer?)

1099
00:38:02,260 --> 00:38:03,358
("George Washington" was the correct answer.)

1100
00:38:03,359 --> 00:38:04,814
(They get it right.)

1101
00:38:04,959 --> 00:38:06,514
I've never really looked at it.

1102
00:38:07,129 --> 00:38:09,261
- Please let it be a dud. - I pick four.

1103
00:38:09,470 --> 00:38:10,869
- Four. - No, no.

1104
00:38:10,870 --> 00:38:12,739
- We should pick four. - I think it'll be another dud.

1105
00:38:12,740 --> 00:38:14,369
- There are no consecutive duds. - He's right.

1106
00:38:14,370 --> 00:38:16,631
- There aren't any. - Who knows?

1107
00:38:16,640 --> 00:38:18,599
- It's possible. - Really?

1108
00:38:18,780 --> 00:38:20,223
I think it is.

1109
00:38:20,479 --> 00:38:21,878
Really? Which number grabs your attention?

1110
00:38:21,879 --> 00:38:24,273
- Right, you should pick. - Which number?

1111
00:38:24,919 --> 00:38:27,748
- 2. - 2.

1112
00:38:27,950 --> 00:38:31,389
(Neither team chose this number.)

1113
00:38:31,390 --> 00:38:34,759
(Will she be lucky this time as well?)

1114
00:38:34,760 --> 00:38:35,759
- All right. - Two points.

1115
00:38:35,760 --> 00:38:36,870
(She sure is lucky.)

1116
00:38:37,200 --> 00:38:38,311
- All right. - Two points.

1117
00:38:39,100 --> 00:38:40,644
Let's go. Pick again.

1118
00:38:41,069 --> 00:38:43,299
- I told you. - We should've picked two.

1119
00:38:43,300 --> 00:38:45,056
(Team Champion gets gloomier and gloomier.)

1120
00:38:45,410 --> 00:38:47,288
I have no motivation left.

1121
00:38:48,240 --> 00:38:50,239
- 1 more time? - What about number 4?

1122
00:38:50,240 --> 00:38:51,927
- Number four? - Right? No?

1123
00:38:52,310 --> 00:38:53,320
- Number 4. - Number 4.

1124
00:38:54,080 --> 00:38:56,018
(2 unlucky members had chosen number 4.)

1125
00:38:56,019 --> 00:38:57,378
(What will happen this time?)

1126
00:38:57,379 --> 00:38:59,318
- It can't be another dud. - It can't be.

1127
00:38:59,319 --> 00:39:01,309
(What will happen this time?)

1128
00:39:02,319 --> 00:39:05,360
(Dud)

1129
00:39:05,459 --> 00:39:06,742
It's a dud again.

1130
00:39:06,930 --> 00:39:08,259
- It's a dud again. - It's a dud again.

1131
00:39:08,260 --> 00:39:09,628
- It's another dud. - Okay!

1132
00:39:09,629 --> 00:39:10,628
(We still have hope.)

1133
00:39:10,629 --> 00:39:13,029
- It's a dud again. - It's a dud again.

1134
00:39:13,030 --> 00:39:14,180
Gosh.

1135
00:39:14,600 --> 00:39:17,023
We have to get the question right. All the duds have been removed.

1136
00:39:17,140 --> 00:39:19,108
- We have to. - We can get past them.

1137
00:39:19,109 --> 00:39:21,866
This time, we have to win.

1138
00:39:22,339 --> 00:39:23,349
All right.

1139
00:39:23,379 --> 00:39:25,198
Here is the question.

1140
00:39:25,550 --> 00:39:27,498
"In the ondol system,"

1141
00:39:27,850 --> 00:39:30,119
"what is the passage for fire and smoke..."

1142
00:39:30,120 --> 00:39:32,418
"called?"

1143
00:39:32,419 --> 00:39:34,648
Seok Jin definitely knows it.

1144
00:39:34,649 --> 00:39:36,336
(He has used ondol.)

1145
00:39:37,060 --> 00:39:38,529
For generations...

1146
00:39:38,530 --> 00:39:40,529
His father actually...

1147
00:39:40,530 --> 00:39:41,998
worked for an ondol company.

1148
00:39:41,999 --> 00:39:44,259
(His father worked for an ondol company.)

1149
00:39:44,260 --> 00:39:45,268
He didn't.

1150
00:39:45,269 --> 00:39:46,511
(I can't go along with that.)

1151
00:39:46,930 --> 00:39:47,969
He didn't.

1152
00:39:47,970 --> 00:39:49,568
(Leave my parents alone.)

1153
00:39:49,569 --> 00:39:51,357
- Gosh. - Get your facts straight.

1154
00:39:52,339 --> 00:39:53,380
I mean...

1155
00:39:53,870 --> 00:39:56,264
My father didn't.

1156
00:39:56,439 --> 00:39:58,009
He goes along with most jokes,

1157
00:39:58,010 --> 00:39:59,849
but he couldn't this time.

1158
00:39:59,850 --> 00:40:02,119
He changed my father's job.

1159
00:40:02,120 --> 00:40:03,219
(Jokes about family are not accepted.)

1160
00:40:03,220 --> 00:40:04,563
All right. "Number one,"

1161
00:40:05,519 --> 00:40:06,600
"gorae."

1162
00:40:07,289 --> 00:40:08,935
"Number two, geobuk."

1163
00:40:09,319 --> 00:40:11,612
- "Geobuk"? - "Number three, yeou."

1164
00:40:12,089 --> 00:40:13,358
"Number four, ori."

1165
00:40:13,359 --> 00:40:14,702
- Let me answer! - Let me answer!

1166
00:40:14,760 --> 00:40:15,759
Number one, "gorae".

1167
00:40:15,760 --> 00:40:17,011
- Let me answer! - Let me answer!

1168
00:40:17,060 --> 00:40:18,171
Number one, "gorae".

1169
00:40:18,260 --> 00:40:20,219
(It's a chance to win 15 points at once.)

1170
00:40:20,269 --> 00:40:21,310
"Gorae".

1171
00:40:21,470 --> 00:40:22,668
- Okay! - What did I say?

1172
00:40:22,669 --> 00:40:23,811
"Gorae".

1173
00:40:23,939 --> 00:40:25,555
- Trust me. - "Rae" means...

1174
00:40:25,609 --> 00:40:28,094
"Rae" means "passage".

1175
00:40:28,140 --> 00:40:30,309
What a shame. I knew it too.

1176
00:40:30,310 --> 00:40:31,390
This...

1177
00:40:31,609 --> 00:40:33,179
- All of number 4. - All of number 4.

1178
00:40:33,180 --> 00:40:34,463
- Open it! - It's "gorae".

1179
00:40:35,649 --> 00:40:37,119
- Five. - Okay!

1180
00:40:37,120 --> 00:40:39,248
(Their score goes up.)

1181
00:40:39,249 --> 00:40:40,401
- 8. - 8.

1182
00:40:41,419 --> 00:40:42,469
11.

1183
00:40:42,620 --> 00:40:43,619
- 7. - 7.

1184
00:40:43,620 --> 00:40:45,429
(Frustrated)

1185
00:40:45,430 --> 00:40:46,829
(The situation reversed at once.)

1186
00:40:46,830 --> 00:40:47,840
Unbelievable.

1187
00:40:48,330 --> 00:40:49,529
- 11. - 11.

1188
00:40:49,530 --> 00:40:50,628
(They win 15 points in total.)

1189
00:40:50,629 --> 00:40:51,711
15 points!

1190
00:40:51,830 --> 00:40:52,840
Nice!

1191
00:40:53,169 --> 00:40:54,268
- Stop! - Stop!

1192
00:40:54,269 --> 00:40:55,898
(We won't repeat the same mistake.)

1193
00:40:55,899 --> 00:40:57,555
(Stop)

1194
00:40:57,740 --> 00:40:58,809
- Go! - Go!

1195
00:40:58,810 --> 00:41:00,309
(They try to egg on their opponent.)

1196
00:41:00,310 --> 00:41:02,098
- You stop here? - Go! Kwang Soo!

1197
00:41:02,479 --> 00:41:04,258
You petty!

1198
00:41:04,280 --> 00:41:05,978
- Just one more round. - Stop!

1199
00:41:05,979 --> 00:41:07,525
- Just one more. - No. Stop.

1200
00:41:07,680 --> 00:41:09,396
- One more round. - If we make a mistake,

1201
00:41:09,479 --> 00:41:10,918
- we won't be able to recover. - Just one more round.

1202
00:41:10,919 --> 00:41:12,088
We won't be able to recover.

1203
00:41:12,089 --> 00:41:13,200
Okay. We have to win.

1204
00:41:13,589 --> 00:41:14,903
We have to win this time.

1205
00:41:15,019 --> 00:41:16,159
Here we go.

1206
00:41:16,160 --> 00:41:18,654
"The name of this island means..."

1207
00:41:19,390 --> 00:41:22,299
"'a beaming island'."

1208
00:41:22,300 --> 00:41:23,573
- "A beaming island"? - I know this one.

1209
00:41:23,859 --> 00:41:25,890
"Number one, Silmi Island."

1210
00:41:26,129 --> 00:41:28,290
"Number two, Anmyeon Island."

1211
00:41:29,339 --> 00:41:31,359
"Number three, Wan Island."

1212
00:41:31,910 --> 00:41:33,309
"Number four, Jeju Island."

1213
00:41:33,310 --> 00:41:34,469
- Let me answer! - Let me answer!

1214
00:41:34,470 --> 00:41:36,179
(Team Ace wants to answer right away.)

1215
00:41:36,180 --> 00:41:38,509
- What's your answer? - "Wan Island".

1216
00:41:38,510 --> 00:41:39,849
- "Wan Island"? - "Wan Island"?

1217
00:41:39,850 --> 00:41:41,748
- Isn't it "Anmyeon Island"? - Let me answer!

1218
00:41:41,749 --> 00:41:43,179
(Team Ace is not sure.)

1219
00:41:43,180 --> 00:41:44,362
Number four, "Jeju Island".

1220
00:41:45,289 --> 00:41:49,663
(While other members are not sure, Jae Seok says, "Jeju Island".)

1221
00:41:49,689 --> 00:41:54,628
(If it's correct, the situation might reverse.)

1222
00:41:54,629 --> 00:41:55,699
It's "Wan Island"!

1223
00:41:55,700 --> 00:41:56,771
(Frustrated)

1224
00:41:57,430 --> 00:41:58,529
- Let me answer! - Let me answer!

1225
00:41:58,530 --> 00:42:01,155
(It's Team Champion's turn.)

1226
00:42:02,999 --> 00:42:04,717
- Isn't it "Wan Island"? - Isn't it "Silmi Island"?

1227
00:42:04,899 --> 00:42:07,232
- I think it's number 3. - Isn't it number 1?

1228
00:42:07,510 --> 00:42:10,679
(Team Champion thinks the correct answer is "Wan Island".)

1229
00:42:10,680 --> 00:42:11,779
- Let me answer! - Let me answer!

1230
00:42:11,780 --> 00:42:12,949
Number one, "Silmi Island".

1231
00:42:12,950 --> 00:42:13,978
No.

1232
00:42:13,979 --> 00:42:15,494
- It's wrong. - It's wrong?

1233
00:42:16,080 --> 00:42:17,518
(Why did you suddenly say, "Silmi Island"?)

1234
00:42:17,519 --> 00:42:19,034
- It's wrong. - It's wrong?

1235
00:42:19,249 --> 00:42:20,703
It's "Wan Island".

1236
00:42:21,149 --> 00:42:22,271
- Let me answer! - Let me answer!

1237
00:42:22,760 --> 00:42:23,759
"Wan Island".

1238
00:42:23,760 --> 00:42:24,931
- What number? - Number Three.

1239
00:42:25,560 --> 00:42:26,599
Number three, "Wan Island".

1240
00:42:27,459 --> 00:42:29,659
(Seok Jin sounds confident. Is it correct?)

1241
00:42:29,660 --> 00:42:32,128
(Correct)

1242
00:42:32,129 --> 00:42:34,149
- We did it! - Nice!

1243
00:42:34,999 --> 00:42:36,639
- We knew it was number three. - Please.

1244
00:42:36,640 --> 00:42:37,851
Please discuss first.

1245
00:42:38,709 --> 00:42:40,338
I said it was "Wan Island" from the beginning.

1246
00:42:40,339 --> 00:42:42,804
- We just need 6 points. - 6 points.

1247
00:42:43,080 --> 00:42:44,595
- Six points. - I'm nervous.

1248
00:42:44,640 --> 00:42:46,164
- I'm nervous. Just six points. - Let's do this.

1249
00:42:46,910 --> 00:42:49,475
- They need six points. - Right.

1250
00:42:49,649 --> 00:42:51,918
They need more than five points,

1251
00:42:51,919 --> 00:42:53,389
so they'll have to keep trying.

1252
00:42:53,390 --> 00:42:54,763
Ji Hyo, just do whatever you want.

1253
00:42:54,819 --> 00:42:55,958
Gosh.

1254
00:42:55,959 --> 00:42:57,358
Just follow your gut.

1255
00:42:57,359 --> 00:42:58,858
Just do it.

1256
00:42:58,859 --> 00:43:01,788
(Will Ji Hyo manage to win more than 6 points?)

1257
00:43:01,789 --> 00:43:02,810
You have golden hands.

1258
00:43:05,300 --> 00:43:06,310
Go.

1259
00:43:07,069 --> 00:43:08,529
- Number 6. - Number 6.

1260
00:43:08,530 --> 00:43:09,651
- Okay. - Number six.

1261
00:43:09,800 --> 00:43:11,139
(No one has touched number 6 yet. What will be the result?)

1262
00:43:11,140 --> 00:43:12,708
- It's not a dud. - It has points.

1263
00:43:12,709 --> 00:43:13,938
- 3 points! - Just 1 more.

1264
00:43:13,939 --> 00:43:15,454
(Amazing)

1265
00:43:15,780 --> 00:43:17,527
- Just 1 more. - Just 1 more.

1266
00:43:17,680 --> 00:43:19,094
- Another 3 points. - Another 3 points.

1267
00:43:19,350 --> 00:43:20,478
- Another 3 points. - This doesn't feel right.

1268
00:43:20,479 --> 00:43:21,579
(If they choose a dud, they'll lose.)

1269
00:43:21,580 --> 00:43:22,660
Either number 1 or 10.

1270
00:43:23,019 --> 00:43:24,018
(They can't seem to decide.)

1271
00:43:24,019 --> 00:43:26,049
Would number seven be a dud?

1272
00:43:26,050 --> 00:43:27,464
I think it's a dud.

1273
00:43:28,550 --> 00:43:30,034
Either a dud or one point.

1274
00:43:30,220 --> 00:43:31,230
Please.

1275
00:43:31,660 --> 00:43:32,958
(What is her next choice?)

1276
00:43:32,959 --> 00:43:34,929
- Just relax. - Okay. I choose number five.

1277
00:43:34,930 --> 00:43:36,314
- Number 5. - Number 5.

1278
00:43:37,060 --> 00:43:38,128
(The ace's guess)

1279
00:43:38,129 --> 00:43:39,917
(Number 5 has not been opened either.)

1280
00:43:42,569 --> 00:43:43,599
Three points.

1281
00:43:43,600 --> 00:43:44,668
(Will they catch up?)

1282
00:43:44,669 --> 00:43:45,668
Please. One point.

1283
00:43:45,669 --> 00:43:47,689
(Or is it a dud?)

1284
00:43:47,870 --> 00:43:50,031
- I'll open it. 1, 2, 3. - Please.

1285
00:43:50,609 --> 00:43:51,639
One point.

1286
00:43:51,640 --> 00:43:53,094
(1 point)

1287
00:43:54,410 --> 00:43:56,399
- Okay. - This is not okay.

1288
00:43:56,580 --> 00:43:57,863
I can't do this.

1289
00:43:58,950 --> 00:44:01,288
I'm so nervous.

1290
00:44:01,289 --> 00:44:02,602
(Their life is prolonged.)

1291
00:44:02,990 --> 00:44:04,288
- I'm so nervous. - I can't do this.

1292
00:44:04,289 --> 00:44:05,573
- I don't like it. - My heart is going to burst.

1293
00:44:05,990 --> 00:44:07,040
Ji Hyo.

1294
00:44:07,260 --> 00:44:08,429
- My heart. - Please.

1295
00:44:08,430 --> 00:44:09,672
I'm so nervous.

1296
00:44:09,800 --> 00:44:11,759
- Here it comes. - Please!

1297
00:44:11,760 --> 00:44:13,548
- Here it comes. - Dud!

1298
00:44:13,899 --> 00:44:15,739
Why did it have to be one point?

1299
00:44:15,740 --> 00:44:16,739
- Please. - Here it comes.

1300
00:44:16,740 --> 00:44:19,234
- Dud! - Dud!

1301
00:44:19,269 --> 00:44:21,139
- Dud! - Ji Hyo, please.

1302
00:44:21,140 --> 00:44:22,139
It's up to you.

1303
00:44:22,140 --> 00:44:24,534
(It's all up to the ace now.)

1304
00:44:27,649 --> 00:44:30,079
(She has a hard time making up her mind.)

1305
00:44:30,080 --> 00:44:31,766
Ji Hyo, number 10.

1306
00:44:32,649 --> 00:44:35,851
(Ji Hyo, number 10.)

1307
00:44:36,789 --> 00:44:38,188
(Is he feeling something?)

1308
00:44:38,189 --> 00:44:39,402
(Jae Seok suddenly says, "number 10".)

1309
00:44:39,660 --> 00:44:43,559
(Number 10 has never been opened.)

1310
00:44:43,560 --> 00:44:45,728
- Number 10. - Don't listen. It's a dud.

1311
00:44:45,729 --> 00:44:48,356
(He can't be feeling something.)

1312
00:44:49,600 --> 00:44:51,239
I want them to listen to Jae Seok.

1313
00:44:51,240 --> 00:44:52,482
(The legendary unlucky man)

1314
00:44:53,169 --> 00:44:55,168
(Jae Seok makes Ji Hyo think.)

1315
00:44:55,169 --> 00:44:56,239
I choose number five.

1316
00:44:56,240 --> 00:44:58,378
(She chooses number 5.)

1317
00:44:58,379 --> 00:44:59,521
Number five?

1318
00:44:59,780 --> 00:45:01,309
- Please! - Number five?

1319
00:45:01,310 --> 00:45:02,679
- Number 5? - Suddenly number 5?

1320
00:45:02,680 --> 00:45:03,849
Let's go.

1321
00:45:03,850 --> 00:45:05,018
- Number five. - Kwang Soo, please!

1322
00:45:05,019 --> 00:45:06,261
- Number five. - Kwang Soo!

1323
00:45:06,990 --> 00:45:08,018
Kwang Soo!

1324
00:45:08,019 --> 00:45:09,272
If it's not a dud, we lose.

1325
00:45:10,220 --> 00:45:11,230
Kwang Soo, please!

1326
00:45:12,289 --> 00:45:13,489
Let's go!

1327
00:45:13,490 --> 00:45:14,600
(They're only one point apart.)

1328
00:45:15,600 --> 00:45:16,610
I'll open it.

1329
00:45:17,060 --> 00:45:18,070
One,

1330
00:45:18,729 --> 00:45:19,728
two...

1331
00:45:19,729 --> 00:45:22,668
(How will this tight game end?)

1332
00:45:22,669 --> 00:45:23,668
Three.

1333
00:45:23,669 --> 00:45:24,739
(2 points)

1334
00:45:24,740 --> 00:45:26,992
(She sure is the ace.)

1335
00:45:27,839 --> 00:45:30,465
(Final score, 16:15)

1336
00:45:31,010 --> 00:45:34,484
(Team Ace wins.)

1337
00:45:34,810 --> 00:45:37,172
(Unbelievable)

1338
00:45:38,149 --> 00:45:39,937
(Is it my fault?)

1339
00:45:40,749 --> 00:45:42,318
- Ji Hyo! - I knew it.

1340
00:45:42,319 --> 00:45:43,358
(Ji Hyo made the right choice.)

1341
00:45:43,359 --> 00:45:44,633
- Okay. - What's number 10?

1342
00:45:44,959 --> 00:45:45,969
Number 10?

1343
00:45:46,229 --> 00:45:47,989
- I chose number 10. - See?

1344
00:45:47,990 --> 00:45:49,659
(Jae Seok's choice, number 10, is a dud.)

1345
00:45:49,660 --> 00:45:52,527
(How do you do this?)

1346
00:45:53,069 --> 00:45:56,038
(Good that they didn't listen to him.)

1347
00:45:56,039 --> 00:45:58,019
Please listen to Jae Seok.

1348
00:45:58,870 --> 00:46:00,960
It's okay. We did well.

1349
00:46:01,339 --> 00:46:03,878
Okay! We won first round!

1350
00:46:03,879 --> 00:46:05,799
(Team Ace wins Round 1.)

1351
00:46:06,350 --> 00:46:08,248
- Yes! - We fought well.

1352
00:46:08,249 --> 00:46:10,049
I can't believe it.

1353
00:46:10,050 --> 00:46:13,321
(Team Ace: 5 slots, Team Champion:1 slot)

1354
00:46:13,890 --> 00:46:15,989
(The historic competition gets fiercer and fiercer.)

1355
00:46:15,990 --> 00:46:18,110
(What is the next game?)

1356
00:46:18,220 --> 00:46:20,008
Players are entering!

1357
00:46:20,160 --> 00:46:21,240
Let's go!

1358
00:46:22,030 --> 00:46:23,070
Ji Hyo is unbelievable.

1359
00:46:23,499 --> 00:46:24,640
She is...

1360
00:46:24,760 --> 00:46:28,102
More than 1 person wanted to choose number 10.

1361
00:46:28,169 --> 00:46:30,099
She is incredible.

1362
00:46:30,100 --> 00:46:31,312
Here is the Round Two.

1363
00:46:31,640 --> 00:46:34,740
Each team starts with five slots on the roulette wheel each.

1364
00:46:34,910 --> 00:46:37,565
In each round, you bet a number of slots.

1365
00:46:37,740 --> 00:46:40,709
The winning team of the round wins as many slots as they bet.

1366
00:46:41,080 --> 00:46:44,351
After hearing the keyword of each round, the team leaders will...

1367
00:46:44,379 --> 00:46:47,348
select players for that round...

1368
00:46:47,450 --> 00:46:51,226
and decide how many slots they will bet on those players.

1369
00:46:51,419 --> 00:46:52,788
Who can I trust?

1370
00:46:52,789 --> 00:46:54,809
Jong Kook hates thinking.

1371
00:46:55,800 --> 00:46:57,375
Here are the keywords.

1372
00:46:58,060 --> 00:46:59,545
First round, "water".

1373
00:46:59,700 --> 00:47:01,387
Second round, "fire".

1374
00:47:01,530 --> 00:47:03,257
Third round, "foot".

1375
00:47:04,370 --> 00:47:05,498
- Ji Hyo. - Yes?

1376
00:47:05,499 --> 00:47:06,651
Do you want to choose me for "water"?

1377
00:47:07,039 --> 00:47:09,463
- Okay. - Can't team leaders participate?

1378
00:47:09,910 --> 00:47:11,555
- They can. - They can.

1379
00:47:11,609 --> 00:47:13,779
Ji Hyo should play too.

1380
00:47:13,780 --> 00:47:15,295
(We need our ace to play.)

1381
00:47:15,680 --> 00:47:17,878
(Who will play for Team Ace?)

1382
00:47:17,879 --> 00:47:19,449
"Fire" might mean...

1383
00:47:19,450 --> 00:47:20,949
spicy food.

1384
00:47:20,950 --> 00:47:22,188
I can't eat spicy food.

1385
00:47:22,189 --> 00:47:23,318
- Right. - Right?

1386
00:47:23,319 --> 00:47:26,329
(They have to guess the games and select the right players.)

1387
00:47:26,330 --> 00:47:28,358
- Bet a lot on me. - Hold on.

1388
00:47:28,359 --> 00:47:30,147
(You trust me, right?)

1389
00:47:30,560 --> 00:47:32,059
(I love your confidence.)

1390
00:47:32,060 --> 00:47:33,917
Jong Kook for "foot" and Kwang Soo for "water".

1391
00:47:34,069 --> 00:47:35,469
We have to win this round.

1392
00:47:35,470 --> 00:47:37,863
- Next round... - We have to win.

1393
00:47:37,970 --> 00:47:39,108
Let's start.

1394
00:47:39,109 --> 00:47:40,668
(They have selected players and made bets.)

1395
00:47:40,669 --> 00:47:43,679
The keyword for the first round is "water".

1396
00:47:43,680 --> 00:47:44,838
The game is called...

1397
00:47:44,839 --> 00:47:47,335
Ball over the Water.

1398
00:47:48,310 --> 00:47:50,268
Blow the team's ping-pong ball.

1399
00:47:50,319 --> 00:47:51,865
The ball can only move...

1400
00:47:51,979 --> 00:47:54,171
to the cups in the team's color or white cups.

1401
00:47:54,220 --> 00:47:57,149
The team whose ball gets to the last cup first wins.

1402
00:47:58,859 --> 00:48:00,728
(It sounds hard.)

1403
00:48:00,729 --> 00:48:01,841
Jae Seok...

1404
00:48:01,930 --> 00:48:03,314
Let's hope they didn't choose Se Chan.

1405
00:48:04,600 --> 00:48:06,429
- Gosh. - It sounds hard.

1406
00:48:06,430 --> 00:48:07,599
(Who are the players?)

1407
00:48:07,600 --> 00:48:09,699
- Let me introduce the players. - Okay.

1408
00:48:09,700 --> 00:48:12,168
Yu Jae Seok for Team Ace.

1409
00:48:12,169 --> 00:48:13,168
(Team Ace chose Jae Seok.)

1410
00:48:13,169 --> 00:48:15,563
(Good that his mouth sticks out.)

1411
00:48:15,740 --> 00:48:16,909
For Team Champion...

1412
00:48:16,910 --> 00:48:19,148
(Team Champion)

1413
00:48:19,149 --> 00:48:20,492
Lee Kwang Soo.

1414
00:48:21,410 --> 00:48:22,679
(The cheater brothers will compete.)

1415
00:48:22,680 --> 00:48:24,079
I knew it'd be Kwang Soo.

1416
00:48:24,080 --> 00:48:25,292
(The cheater brothers will compete.)

1417
00:48:25,620 --> 00:48:28,588
(Every time they compete, something dirty happens.)

1418
00:48:28,589 --> 00:48:31,892
(The two are known for playing dirty.)

1419
00:48:32,060 --> 00:48:34,458
(They focus more on playing dirty than winning.)

1420
00:48:34,459 --> 00:48:36,722
(What will they do today?)

1421
00:48:36,830 --> 00:48:38,748
Okay. It'll be a dirty game.

1422
00:48:39,229 --> 00:48:40,299
- We'll... - All right.

1423
00:48:40,300 --> 00:48:41,398
- Kwang Soo. - Okay.

1424
00:48:41,399 --> 00:48:43,199
Today you can be as dirty...

1425
00:48:43,200 --> 00:48:44,483
- as you want. - Okay.

1426
00:48:44,800 --> 00:48:46,009
(You can be dirty too.)

1427
00:48:46,010 --> 00:48:48,869
- It's your day. - I choose the color green.

1428
00:48:48,870 --> 00:48:51,334
(Team Ace's Yu Jae Seok versus Team Champion's Lee Kwang Soo)

1429
00:48:52,140 --> 00:48:53,624
This cup?

1430
00:48:53,709 --> 00:48:55,579
We have to get there first? Okay.

1431
00:48:55,580 --> 00:48:56,918
You have to go diagonally.

1432
00:48:56,919 --> 00:48:58,767
1, 2, 3, 4. Do you understand?

1433
00:48:59,950 --> 00:49:01,489
We have advantage. Our player's mouth sticks out more.

1434
00:49:01,490 --> 00:49:03,358
Ready.

1435
00:49:03,359 --> 00:49:05,036
(The "water" game starts.)

1436
00:49:05,419 --> 00:49:06,469
Okay.

1437
00:49:07,129 --> 00:49:09,358
(Jae Seok cheats as soon as the game starts.)

1438
00:49:09,359 --> 00:49:11,319
He blew the other team's ball.

1439
00:49:12,030 --> 00:49:13,068
No.

1440
00:49:13,069 --> 00:49:14,128
(I stopped Kwang Soo.)

1441
00:49:14,129 --> 00:49:15,544
Good. Kwang Soo is doing well.

1442
00:49:15,839 --> 00:49:17,759
(Kwang Soo's ball moves on to the next cup.)

1443
00:49:18,300 --> 00:49:20,330
(Keep going!)

1444
00:49:20,839 --> 00:49:23,409
(But he fails to move the ball to the next cup.)

1445
00:49:23,410 --> 00:49:24,621
You should fill the cup with more water.

1446
00:49:25,209 --> 00:49:26,779
- Fill the cup. - There's not enough water.

1447
00:49:26,780 --> 00:49:27,809
There you go.

1448
00:49:27,810 --> 00:49:28,921
Kwang Soo, stop.

1449
00:49:29,680 --> 00:49:31,478
(I think it's coming.)

1450
00:49:31,479 --> 00:49:34,349
(The cheating spirit is coming.)

1451
00:49:34,350 --> 00:49:35,562
Here it comes.

1452
00:49:35,890 --> 00:49:37,059
Here it comes.

1453
00:49:37,060 --> 00:49:39,088
(The cheating spirit fills him.)

1454
00:49:39,089 --> 00:49:40,259
- He used his hand. - No.

1455
00:49:40,260 --> 00:49:41,259
His hand...

1456
00:49:41,260 --> 00:49:43,858
(He touched the ball.)

1457
00:49:43,859 --> 00:49:44,929
(Frustrated)

1458
00:49:44,930 --> 00:49:46,485
- His hand... - It wasn't intentional.

1459
00:49:46,830 --> 00:49:48,486
I didn't do it on purpose.

1460
00:49:48,930 --> 00:49:50,369
You can't blow the other's ball.

1461
00:49:50,370 --> 00:49:51,969
You can't, right?

1462
00:49:51,970 --> 00:49:54,333
- Kwang Soo used his hand. - He didn't mean to.

1463
00:49:54,939 --> 00:49:58,338
(They're still near the starting line.)

1464
00:49:58,339 --> 00:49:59,389
Relax.

1465
00:50:00,350 --> 00:50:01,562
Put your hand away.

1466
00:50:02,350 --> 00:50:04,378
(Jong Kook protects the ball with his hand.)

1467
00:50:04,379 --> 00:50:05,378
(Blowing)

1468
00:50:05,379 --> 00:50:06,461
There you go!

1469
00:50:06,990 --> 00:50:09,071
It worked! The ball moved over.

1470
00:50:09,760 --> 00:50:11,537
(Good job, Jae Seok.)

1471
00:50:12,830 --> 00:50:14,173
Okay. Good.

1472
00:50:14,560 --> 00:50:16,377
(Jae Seok keeps moving forward.)

1473
00:50:16,830 --> 00:50:18,429
(Continue to the last cup.)

1474
00:50:18,430 --> 00:50:19,480
Good. Keep going.

1475
00:50:20,100 --> 00:50:21,917
(I can't let you.)

1476
00:50:22,539 --> 00:50:23,568
Keep going.

1477
00:50:23,569 --> 00:50:25,139
(The cheater brothers...)

1478
00:50:25,140 --> 00:50:27,998
(play dirty as always.)

1479
00:50:29,180 --> 00:50:31,301
- My goodness. - It's flooding here.

1480
00:50:32,109 --> 00:50:34,503
(Flooding)

1481
00:50:36,080 --> 00:50:37,549
Is this how this game is played?

1482
00:50:37,550 --> 00:50:38,619
(Is this how this game is played?)

1483
00:50:38,620 --> 00:50:40,841
(Yes, it is.)

1484
00:50:40,950 --> 00:50:42,434
The game is too dirty.

1485
00:50:42,789 --> 00:50:44,607
- He did it! Kwang Soo! - He did it!

1486
00:50:45,359 --> 00:50:48,059
(Kwang Soo pulls himself together and moves forward.)

1487
00:50:48,060 --> 00:50:50,282
- He did it! Kwang Soo! - He did it!

1488
00:50:50,430 --> 00:50:51,759
He did it! When did you come this far?

1489
00:50:51,760 --> 00:50:52,841
- He's here! - Let's go.

1490
00:50:53,169 --> 00:50:54,529
Good. We can win.

1491
00:50:54,530 --> 00:50:56,199
(Will you get out of my way?)

1492
00:50:56,200 --> 00:50:57,512
(I don't think so.)

1493
00:50:58,269 --> 00:51:00,562
(Jae Seok splashes water on Kwang Soo.)

1494
00:51:01,209 --> 00:51:05,452
(It's as if they're playing the game in the water.)

1495
00:51:05,810 --> 00:51:07,549
- Jae Seok, why don't you come here? - Okay.

1496
00:51:07,550 --> 00:51:09,266
- Come here. - I'll try.

1497
00:51:10,050 --> 00:51:11,737
- Almost there. - Come here.

1498
00:51:12,050 --> 00:51:13,868
Good. Kwang Soo, just one more.

1499
00:51:13,919 --> 00:51:15,518
Kwang Soo, you can do this.

1500
00:51:15,519 --> 00:51:16,559
- Gosh. - Blow lightly.

1501
00:51:16,560 --> 00:51:17,559
Put your head away.

1502
00:51:17,560 --> 00:51:18,801
(Jae Seok hasn't moved.)

1503
00:51:19,089 --> 00:51:20,099
You're almost there.

1504
00:51:20,589 --> 00:51:22,245
- Okay! - Just one more!

1505
00:51:22,729 --> 00:51:24,759
(Kwang Soo's ball is only one cup away from the destination.)

1506
00:51:24,760 --> 00:51:27,029
- Good! Kwang Soo, just one more! - You can do this.

1507
00:51:27,030 --> 00:51:28,029
Just one more!

1508
00:51:28,030 --> 00:51:29,989
- Kwang Soo. - No.

1509
00:51:30,300 --> 00:51:31,538
Stop him.

1510
00:51:31,539 --> 00:51:32,823
(Jae Seok falls behind.)

1511
00:51:33,410 --> 00:51:35,531
Jae Seok, stop him!

1512
00:51:36,979 --> 00:51:38,091
Kwang Soo, focus.

1513
00:51:38,393 --> 00:51:41,035
(Kwang Soo's ball is right in front of the destination.)

1514
00:51:41,036 --> 00:51:43,056
(It's just one cup away.)

1515
00:51:44,560 --> 00:51:45,672
Kwang Soo, focus.

1516
00:51:46,267 --> 00:51:51,250
(Everything depends on Kwang Soo's one final blow. Can he finish it well?)

1517
00:51:51,806 --> 00:51:53,928
(Kwang Soo is preparing his final blow.)

1518
00:51:53,929 --> 00:51:55,029
Kwang Soo, focus.

1519
00:51:55,030 --> 00:51:59,759
(With Jae Seok lagging behind, I'll finish the game.)

1520
00:51:59,760 --> 00:52:00,999
(What?)

1521
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:02,040
He did it!

1522
00:52:03,469 --> 00:52:06,339
(Jae Seok moved over 3 cups at once...)

1523
00:52:06,340 --> 00:52:08,087
(and finished the game.)

1524
00:52:08,539 --> 00:52:12,578
(He blew hard enough to move over 3 cups.)

1525
00:52:12,579 --> 00:52:15,236
(It's so thrilling to come from behind and win.)

1526
00:52:16,949 --> 00:52:19,348
(Shocked)

1527
00:52:19,349 --> 00:52:20,919
Why weren't you blowing?

1528
00:52:20,920 --> 00:52:23,040
I couldn't see anything because of the water in my eyes.

1529
00:52:23,250 --> 00:52:26,658
(Team Champion loses.)

1530
00:52:26,659 --> 00:52:27,800
- I did it! - Hey.

1531
00:52:28,429 --> 00:52:30,198
Hold on. Where did it come from?

1532
00:52:30,199 --> 00:52:31,877
(Let me analyze my winning factors.)

1533
00:52:32,559 --> 00:52:33,669
(His protruding mouth helped.)

1534
00:52:33,670 --> 00:52:35,098
It jumped so high.

1535
00:52:35,099 --> 00:52:37,119
(Thanks to his mouth, he could blow hard.)

1536
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:39,081
This is amazing.

1537
00:52:39,800 --> 00:52:43,042
Team Ace wins the first round.

1538
00:52:43,710 --> 00:52:45,325
How many did they bet? That's important.

1539
00:52:45,610 --> 00:52:48,009
Let me tell you how many slots they bet.

1540
00:52:48,010 --> 00:52:49,249
- I hope it's 1. - Is it more than 2?

1541
00:52:49,250 --> 00:52:52,979
(How many slots did Team Ace bet on Jae Seok?)

1542
00:52:52,980 --> 00:52:54,018
3 slots.

1543
00:52:54,019 --> 00:52:55,518
(Team Ace wins 3 slots.)

1544
00:52:55,519 --> 00:52:56,702
(It was a good idea.)

1545
00:52:57,489 --> 00:52:58,529
We bet three slots.

1546
00:52:58,960 --> 00:53:00,980
Hold on. They bet three slots on Jae Seok only?

1547
00:53:01,159 --> 00:53:02,988
- How could they do that? - Three slots on Jae Seok?

1548
00:53:02,989 --> 00:53:04,342
Look at my team.

1549
00:53:04,400 --> 00:53:07,268
(You'll understand.)

1550
00:53:07,269 --> 00:53:09,368
(There are not many to rely on.)

1551
00:53:09,369 --> 00:53:10,768
He won, so I can't say anything.

1552
00:53:10,769 --> 00:53:13,294
Other than Jae Seok, there are not many...

1553
00:53:13,940 --> 00:53:15,151
- There are not... - We're like that.

1554
00:53:15,570 --> 00:53:17,427
- My team is like that. - We're like that.

1555
00:53:17,679 --> 00:53:20,709
The keyword for the second round is "fire".

1556
00:53:21,079 --> 00:53:23,779
The game is called One Candle.

1557
00:53:23,780 --> 00:53:25,669
(One Candle)

1558
00:53:25,980 --> 00:53:28,348
Hold a candle in one hand, and a plate in the other.

1559
00:53:28,349 --> 00:53:31,823
Put out the other's candle using your plate, and you win.

1560
00:53:32,659 --> 00:53:35,859
If you put out your own candle by mistake, you lose.

1561
00:53:35,860 --> 00:53:37,029
- Be careful. - It sounds fun.

1562
00:53:37,030 --> 00:53:39,299
You should have played this. You're so tall.

1563
00:53:39,300 --> 00:53:40,598
No one could have reached his candle.

1564
00:53:40,599 --> 00:53:41,841
(It could have protected my candle perfectly.)

1565
00:53:42,530 --> 00:53:44,387
If Kwang Soo played this, he would have won.

1566
00:53:45,269 --> 00:53:46,268
(We chose the wrong players.)

1567
00:53:46,269 --> 00:53:48,069
- It's a shame. - We chose the wrong players.

1568
00:53:48,070 --> 00:53:50,836
Let me introduce the players for the second round.

1569
00:53:50,909 --> 00:53:52,555
For Team Champion,

1570
00:53:53,809 --> 00:53:55,049
Jeon So Min.

1571
00:53:55,050 --> 00:53:56,049
Okay.

1572
00:53:56,050 --> 00:53:58,018
(So Min is the weakest one.)

1573
00:53:58,019 --> 00:53:59,379
- It's okay. You can do it. - And...

1574
00:53:59,380 --> 00:54:00,749
- for Team Ace... - We'll win.

1575
00:54:00,750 --> 00:54:02,589
(Who will compete against So Min?)

1576
00:54:02,590 --> 00:54:03,974
Song Ji Hyo.

1577
00:54:04,320 --> 00:54:05,976
How did we choose these two?

1578
00:54:06,190 --> 00:54:07,259
Good.

1579
00:54:07,260 --> 00:54:08,299
Unbelievable.

1580
00:54:09,960 --> 00:54:15,959
(Ji Hyo beat So Min twice in the past.)

1581
00:54:16,730 --> 00:54:23,002
(Will So Min be able to stop Ji Hyo's winning streak?)

1582
00:54:24,039 --> 00:54:25,979
- We still have a chance. - So Min.

1583
00:54:25,980 --> 00:54:28,131
- Let's do this! - So Min.

1584
00:54:28,380 --> 00:54:29,692
We'll teach you a lesson.

1585
00:54:30,349 --> 00:54:31,919
(The ace gets ready to fight.)

1586
00:54:31,920 --> 00:54:33,218
We'll definitely win.

1587
00:54:33,219 --> 00:54:35,846
Ji Hyo is tying her hair up. It's over.

1588
00:54:36,889 --> 00:54:38,919
Ji Hyo is tying her hair up. You can't even do that, can you?

1589
00:54:38,920 --> 00:54:40,488
(He's being childish.)

1590
00:54:40,489 --> 00:54:41,488
Ji Hyo...

1591
00:54:41,489 --> 00:54:43,823
"You can't even do that"?

1592
00:54:44,659 --> 00:54:47,729
You don't need to do that. Your hair is too short.

1593
00:54:48,570 --> 00:54:49,641
I'm taller.

1594
00:54:50,070 --> 00:54:51,109
I'm taller than her.

1595
00:54:51,170 --> 00:54:52,654
And my arms are strangely long.

1596
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:55,192
I think you'll be fine. Your arms are really long.

1597
00:54:55,239 --> 00:54:56,653
They're really long.

1598
00:54:56,940 --> 00:54:58,122
- Finish her. - Like this...

1599
00:54:58,280 --> 00:54:59,592
- and this? - Yes.

1600
00:55:00,179 --> 00:55:01,361
Finish her.

1601
00:55:02,980 --> 00:55:05,241
Stand in the middle with your backs against each other.

1602
00:55:05,420 --> 00:55:07,237
I'm nervous.

1603
00:55:07,320 --> 00:55:09,118
- Let's go. - Be careful.

1604
00:55:09,119 --> 00:55:10,558
- If we win this... - It can go out easily.

1605
00:55:10,559 --> 00:55:11,974
- You can do this. - If we win this, it's over.

1606
00:55:12,090 --> 00:55:13,288
We can't lose.

1607
00:55:13,289 --> 00:55:14,788
(Ji Hyo versus So Min)

1608
00:55:14,789 --> 00:55:17,325
So Min, relax. It's okay. There's nothing else you can do.

1609
00:55:17,599 --> 00:55:19,519
- Ji Hyo, relax. - Finish her.

1610
00:55:19,630 --> 00:55:20,640
Ready.

1611
00:55:20,769 --> 00:55:21,868
One.

1612
00:55:21,869 --> 00:55:23,069
(Careful)

1613
00:55:23,070 --> 00:55:24,109
Two.

1614
00:55:25,570 --> 00:55:26,569
Three.

1615
00:55:26,570 --> 00:55:32,034
(Put out the other's candle without putting out your own.)

1616
00:55:32,909 --> 00:55:34,209
(The "fire" game starts.)

1617
00:55:34,210 --> 00:55:35,709
So Min is a coward.

1618
00:55:35,710 --> 00:55:37,118
She is scared of the candle wax dripping.

1619
00:55:37,119 --> 00:55:38,160
(He attacks with childish words.)

1620
00:55:38,750 --> 00:55:39,932
So Min, try to put out Ji Hyo's candle.

1621
00:55:41,150 --> 00:55:42,462
Attack. Good.

1622
00:55:42,820 --> 00:55:44,204
Use the plate.

1623
00:55:45,059 --> 00:55:46,402
- Good. - Okay.

1624
00:55:46,460 --> 00:55:47,928
- There you go. - Nice.

1625
00:55:47,929 --> 00:55:49,089
(So Min defends her candle.)

1626
00:55:49,090 --> 00:55:51,888
So Min. Be careful. Move slowly.

1627
00:55:52,500 --> 00:55:54,893
(Her candle almost went out.)

1628
00:55:55,769 --> 00:55:58,022
- What are you doing? - Move your left hand slowly.

1629
00:55:58,469 --> 00:56:01,035
(Ji Hyo counterattacks.)

1630
00:56:01,940 --> 00:56:04,637
(So Min uses her long arms.)

1631
00:56:05,179 --> 00:56:06,808
(But...)

1632
00:56:06,809 --> 00:56:08,509
No. Raise it.

1633
00:56:08,510 --> 00:56:09,963
(So Min's candle flickers again.)

1634
00:56:10,349 --> 00:56:12,249
(She revives her candle...)

1635
00:56:12,250 --> 00:56:14,689
(and counterattacks.)

1636
00:56:14,690 --> 00:56:16,871
(Flickering)

1637
00:56:17,360 --> 00:56:18,936
If you move, your candle might go out.

1638
00:56:18,989 --> 00:56:20,171
You're doing well.

1639
00:56:20,530 --> 00:56:22,629
- Good. - Keep going.

1640
00:56:22,630 --> 00:56:24,299
- It's okay. - She can't reach your candle.

1641
00:56:24,300 --> 00:56:25,999
- It's okay. - Attack!

1642
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:27,383
You have to attack!

1643
00:56:27,800 --> 00:56:29,950
- Stop running away and attack! - Attack!

1644
00:56:30,199 --> 00:56:32,462
You have to attack. Stop running away.

1645
00:56:32,500 --> 00:56:34,126
- You have to attack. - Stop running away.

1646
00:56:34,570 --> 00:56:35,908
(Ji Hyo makes everyone run away.)

1647
00:56:35,909 --> 00:56:36,991
Good.

1648
00:56:37,710 --> 00:56:39,093
Good, Ji Hyo.

1649
00:56:39,340 --> 00:56:41,804
So Min, your candle is higher.

1650
00:56:41,980 --> 00:56:42,979
Yes.

1651
00:56:42,980 --> 00:56:44,319
Her arms are so long. Good.

1652
00:56:44,320 --> 00:56:47,350
(They take quick steps while waiving their plates.)

1653
00:56:47,920 --> 00:56:51,394
(It reminds you of the ballet, "Swan Lake".)

1654
00:56:52,219 --> 00:56:55,592
(Ji Hyo is an elegant and aggressive swan.)

1655
00:56:56,389 --> 00:57:00,136
(So Min is a black swan that escapes from Ji Hyo using her long wings.)

1656
00:57:00,500 --> 00:57:03,868
(It suddenly turns into "Black Swan".)

1657
00:57:03,869 --> 00:57:04,999
So Min has long arms.

1658
00:57:05,000 --> 00:57:06,081
Ji Hyo's arms and legs are short.

1659
00:57:06,840 --> 00:57:09,069
They're about the same height, but Ji Hyo's arms are shorter.

1660
00:57:09,070 --> 00:57:11,099
(Jae Seok attacks his team leader.)

1661
00:57:12,039 --> 00:57:13,509
(Why are you dissing me?)

1662
00:57:13,510 --> 00:57:15,196
- Jae Seok. Why... - It's your chance!

1663
00:57:15,550 --> 00:57:18,104
It's your chance, So Min! Attack!

1664
00:57:18,320 --> 00:57:20,168
Why would you attack your team member?

1665
00:57:21,190 --> 00:57:22,249
Ji Hyo is faltering.

1666
00:57:22,250 --> 00:57:23,876
(Unstable)

1667
00:57:24,090 --> 00:57:25,189
It might go out.

1668
00:57:25,190 --> 00:57:26,705
So Min, don't move too fast.

1669
00:57:26,860 --> 00:57:28,328
- Move slowly. - Ji Hyo.

1670
00:57:28,329 --> 00:57:29,844
(The black swan almost puts out her own candle.)

1671
00:57:30,030 --> 00:57:32,050
As you're about to go to the right, go to the left.

1672
00:57:33,059 --> 00:57:34,918
As you're about to go to the left, go to the right.

1673
00:57:35,030 --> 00:57:36,948
- Hit it with your knee. - Go.

1674
00:57:37,170 --> 00:57:39,463
So Min, be bold and start a physical fight.

1675
00:57:40,170 --> 00:57:41,268
Start a physical fight.

1676
00:57:41,269 --> 00:57:42,908
Ji Hyo, step on her foot.

1677
00:57:42,909 --> 00:57:44,960
- That's good. - You can step on her foot.

1678
00:57:45,079 --> 00:57:47,078
- That's good. - No, don't do that.

1679
00:57:47,079 --> 00:57:48,448
(She's better at running away.)

1680
00:57:48,449 --> 00:57:49,459
No.

1681
00:57:50,010 --> 00:57:53,348
(She runs away from the swan.)

1682
00:57:53,349 --> 00:57:56,520
(She's on her toes without realizing it.)

1683
00:57:56,550 --> 00:57:58,944
- No, don't do that. - Don't run away.

1684
00:58:00,429 --> 00:58:01,703
Don't run away.

1685
00:58:02,090 --> 00:58:04,756
- Just hit her. - I can't do it.

1686
00:58:06,360 --> 00:58:09,098
- Don't run away. - Their hands might hurt.

1687
00:58:09,099 --> 00:58:11,827
(Let's attack for real instead of running away.)

1688
00:58:12,170 --> 00:58:14,695
(Has the black swan started to flap?)

1689
00:58:15,110 --> 00:58:16,988
(Flapping)

1690
00:58:17,280 --> 00:58:18,839
Gosh, that's quite strong.

1691
00:58:18,840 --> 00:58:20,348
(The blow is quite strong.)

1692
00:58:20,349 --> 00:58:22,197
- That's good. - Goodness.

1693
00:58:22,579 --> 00:58:23,620
That's good.

1694
00:58:24,420 --> 00:58:25,518
(They're on their toes.)

1695
00:58:25,519 --> 00:58:27,307
- Hey. - Do it more.

1696
00:58:27,719 --> 00:58:30,073
(Stop running away.)

1697
00:58:30,289 --> 00:58:32,915
So Min's went out.

1698
00:58:33,190 --> 00:58:34,759
(While she was running away,)

1699
00:58:34,760 --> 00:58:36,689
(So Min's candle goes out.)

1700
00:58:36,690 --> 00:58:38,129
(Dignity of the ace of 9 years)

1701
00:58:38,130 --> 00:58:39,129
It went out.

1702
00:58:39,130 --> 00:58:40,899
(Her opponent loses for her.)

1703
00:58:40,900 --> 00:58:42,499
- That's amazing. - It went out as she ran away.

1704
00:58:42,500 --> 00:58:44,238
What's going on with our team?

1705
00:58:44,239 --> 00:58:46,598
- We're a perfect team. - Seriously.

1706
00:58:46,599 --> 00:58:48,731
(Team Champion loses again.)

1707
00:58:49,510 --> 00:58:50,879
We're in trouble.

1708
00:58:50,880 --> 00:58:53,038
How could she expose her back?

1709
00:58:53,039 --> 00:58:55,705
Jong Kook is very upset right now.

1710
00:58:56,610 --> 00:58:59,548
- Wait a minute. - Jong Kook is...

1711
00:58:59,650 --> 00:59:01,366
- Okay. - He's angry.

1712
00:59:01,519 --> 00:59:03,149
- Jong Kook. - It's over.

1713
00:59:03,150 --> 00:59:04,288
Good job.

1714
00:59:04,289 --> 00:59:07,118
The winner of the second round is...

1715
00:59:07,230 --> 00:59:08,946
- Team Ace. - Okay.

1716
00:59:09,059 --> 00:59:10,817
It's unbelievable.

1717
00:59:11,059 --> 00:59:12,529
- We won everything. - We keep winning.

1718
00:59:12,530 --> 00:59:14,721
I bet wind would come out if I stretch out my hand.

1719
00:59:15,329 --> 00:59:16,411
We win everything.

1720
00:59:17,199 --> 00:59:19,768
How many slots did the leader of Team Ace bet?

1721
00:59:19,769 --> 00:59:22,109
(Team Ace wins slots for the "fire" game.)

1722
00:59:22,110 --> 00:59:24,029
How many did they bet? That's more important.

1723
00:59:24,440 --> 00:59:26,879
(How many slots did she bet?)

1724
00:59:26,880 --> 00:59:28,209
- It's one slot. - Okay.

1725
00:59:28,210 --> 00:59:30,518
- What about you? - It's one slot.

1726
00:59:30,519 --> 00:59:32,348
- We need to get it back. - We should.

1727
00:59:32,349 --> 00:59:34,036
We have to get it no matter what.

1728
00:59:34,349 --> 00:59:36,774
Keyword for third round is feet.

1729
00:59:37,519 --> 00:59:40,418
- The category is... - Be something we're good at.

1730
00:59:40,829 --> 00:59:42,259
Give us a game that requires strength.

1731
00:59:42,260 --> 00:59:43,899
How about who kicks harder?

1732
00:59:43,900 --> 00:59:46,428
(They're confident about strength.)

1733
00:59:46,429 --> 00:59:47,428
Make it about strength.

1734
00:59:47,429 --> 00:59:49,187
Who can stomp harder?

1735
00:59:49,570 --> 00:59:51,038
- Goodness. - Stomping.

1736
00:59:51,039 --> 00:59:52,698
(It can't be a game like that.)

1737
00:59:52,699 --> 00:59:56,268
The game is called Why Can't You Eat?

1738
00:59:56,269 --> 00:59:57,492
(Foot game is Why Can't You Eat.)

1739
00:59:58,039 --> 00:59:59,554
- Do we eat with our feet? - Is it eating?

1740
01:00:00,210 --> 01:00:01,523
- Is it eating? - Do we eat with our feet?

1741
01:00:02,349 --> 01:00:05,718
While sitting, control a hanging piece of bread...

1742
01:00:05,719 --> 01:00:08,820
attached to a string with your toes.

1743
01:00:08,949 --> 01:00:11,686
The team that eats the bread first wins.

1744
01:00:12,219 --> 01:00:15,017
- We definitely can do it. - Goodness.

1745
01:00:16,289 --> 01:00:24,148
(The eldest Seok Jin is the hope of people in their middle age.)

1746
01:00:26,340 --> 01:00:33,146
(Jong kook is the champion who can do everything well.)

1747
01:00:34,210 --> 01:00:35,725
Goodness, okay.

1748
01:00:36,309 --> 01:00:38,067
Let's win everything.

1749
01:00:39,250 --> 01:00:41,488
Hang some chicken breast instead of bread.

1750
01:00:41,489 --> 01:00:42,488
(He asks for a change in food.)

1751
01:00:42,489 --> 01:00:44,018
(Jong Kook doesn't like flour.)

1752
01:00:44,019 --> 01:00:46,140
- Shake. - How about chicken shake?

1753
01:00:46,190 --> 01:00:47,189
Okay.

1754
01:00:47,190 --> 01:00:50,088
Usually Jong Kook and Seok Jin...

1755
01:00:50,130 --> 01:00:52,423
- don't compete with each other. - That's true.

1756
01:00:52,760 --> 01:00:55,268
Get ready.

1757
01:00:55,269 --> 01:00:56,986
(The "foot" game starts.)

1758
01:00:57,400 --> 01:00:58,611
He'll eat it.

1759
01:00:59,500 --> 01:01:01,339
(It lands immediately on his tongue.)

1760
01:01:01,340 --> 01:01:02,451
Jong Kook is eating it.

1761
01:01:02,840 --> 01:01:05,435
- Wait a minute, Jong Kook. - Jong Kook is eating it.

1762
01:01:05,679 --> 01:01:07,366
(Pushing)

1763
01:01:08,679 --> 01:01:10,149
He's angry right now.

1764
01:01:10,150 --> 01:01:12,574
(The eldest rookie is at east and cheats.)

1765
01:01:12,880 --> 01:01:14,232
Think of LA.

1766
01:01:14,619 --> 01:01:16,288
It's LA. He's eating it.

1767
01:01:16,289 --> 01:01:19,018
(His appetite increases at the thought of LA.)

1768
01:01:19,019 --> 01:01:20,777
Goodness, he looks scary.

1769
01:01:20,829 --> 01:01:22,042
- Do I eat more? - Does he have to eat all?

1770
01:01:22,130 --> 01:01:23,674
- He has to eat all. - Eat until where the cup is.

1771
01:01:24,099 --> 01:01:25,328
(Based on their performance...)

1772
01:01:25,329 --> 01:01:26,916
Seok Jin, you have to eat it.

1773
01:01:26,960 --> 01:01:29,494
(Only the champion might go to LA.)

1774
01:01:30,539 --> 01:01:32,198
- He only ate the end. - Jong Kook is impressive.

1775
01:01:32,199 --> 01:01:34,908
- Seok Jin. - Seok Jin, you got it.

1776
01:01:34,909 --> 01:01:36,688
(Seok Jin's bread is barely close to his mouth.)

1777
01:01:37,380 --> 01:01:39,096
That's good.

1778
01:01:39,309 --> 01:01:41,027
You got it.

1779
01:01:41,679 --> 01:01:42,761
- You're my role model. - You got it.

1780
01:01:43,579 --> 01:01:45,499
- You got it. - You got it.

1781
01:01:46,449 --> 01:01:48,749
He's melting it with his tongue.

1782
01:01:48,750 --> 01:01:50,919
(It's how the eldest member eats bread.)

1783
01:01:50,920 --> 01:01:52,689
- He soaks it while eating it. - It'll take a long time.

1784
01:01:52,690 --> 01:01:54,189
- It must be sweet. - He soaks it.

1785
01:01:54,190 --> 01:01:55,459
(He melts it with his tongue.)

1786
01:01:55,460 --> 01:01:57,399
Gosh, he finally ate it.

1787
01:01:57,400 --> 01:01:59,319
- More and more. - That's not bad.

1788
01:02:00,130 --> 01:02:01,645
He's eating it. He's smart.

1789
01:02:01,800 --> 01:02:03,499
(He's eating at a fast speed.)

1790
01:02:03,500 --> 01:02:05,015
A little bit more.

1791
01:02:05,139 --> 01:02:07,736
Use your foot. Even for Jong Kook,

1792
01:02:07,909 --> 01:02:09,138
it isn't easy.

1793
01:02:09,139 --> 01:02:10,593
It's neck-and-neck.

1794
01:02:11,210 --> 01:02:12,320
That's good.

1795
01:02:13,110 --> 01:02:14,209
(He fails to control it near his face.)

1796
01:02:14,210 --> 01:02:15,209
That's good.

1797
01:02:15,210 --> 01:02:17,098
(He's good at lifting his leg though.)

1798
01:02:18,719 --> 01:02:20,498
I feel bad for Seok Jin.

1799
01:02:20,619 --> 01:02:24,831
At his age, he'd be a director at a company.

1800
01:02:25,260 --> 01:02:27,987
- He's 54. - 54.

1801
01:02:28,030 --> 01:02:31,499
- 54, 54, 54. - 54, 54, 54.

1802
01:02:31,500 --> 01:02:35,198
(Instead of being a director, he pours his heart to entertainment.)

1803
01:02:35,199 --> 01:02:36,412
A little bit more.

1804
01:02:37,400 --> 01:02:40,298
(He makes a veteran's sound.)

1805
01:02:41,269 --> 01:02:42,868
Your nose made a loud sound. Are you okay?

1806
01:02:42,869 --> 01:02:43,939
(What was that sound?)

1807
01:02:43,940 --> 01:02:45,308
(Did he get injured?)

1808
01:02:45,309 --> 01:02:46,492
Jong Kook is laughing too.

1809
01:02:47,710 --> 01:02:50,003
Jong Kook is laughing because it's unbelievable.

1810
01:02:50,079 --> 01:02:52,979
It's a father's challenge.

1811
01:02:52,980 --> 01:02:55,189
(Suddenly, he becomes a father.)

1812
01:02:55,190 --> 01:02:56,564
That's good. You have one chance.

1813
01:02:56,789 --> 01:02:57,830
Pull.

1814
01:02:58,860 --> 01:03:02,259
(Dad, I brought bread. Why can't you eat it?)

1815
01:03:02,260 --> 01:03:03,299
Poor Seok Jin.

1816
01:03:03,559 --> 01:03:05,129
(While Seok Jin can't eat his bread...)

1817
01:03:05,130 --> 01:03:07,049
- He got it. - Goodness.

1818
01:03:07,599 --> 01:03:09,590
(He ate one-third of it.)

1819
01:03:10,000 --> 01:03:12,192
Poor Seok Jin, what do we do?

1820
01:03:12,239 --> 01:03:13,684
He got it. Okay.

1821
01:03:13,800 --> 01:03:15,069
A little more.

1822
01:03:15,070 --> 01:03:16,655
(He takes a big bite.)

1823
01:03:17,309 --> 01:03:19,279
(Jong Kook has one bite left.)

1824
01:03:19,280 --> 01:03:20,308
You're done after one more bite.

1825
01:03:20,309 --> 01:03:21,724
- He's almost done. - Come on.

1826
01:03:22,380 --> 01:03:23,924
Just eat it in one go.

1827
01:03:24,050 --> 01:03:26,348
Do you think it's possible?

1828
01:03:26,349 --> 01:03:28,118
(Kicking)

1829
01:03:28,119 --> 01:03:30,518
My role model kicked me.

1830
01:03:30,519 --> 01:03:31,569
(Is that how he is?)

1831
01:03:32,159 --> 01:03:33,589
(Focus on eating.)

1832
01:03:33,590 --> 01:03:34,600
Okay.

1833
01:03:34,829 --> 01:03:36,809
(I'm working on it.)

1834
01:03:38,099 --> 01:03:39,399
Come on. That's it.

1835
01:03:39,400 --> 01:03:40,999
My role model is cheating.

1836
01:03:41,000 --> 01:03:43,999
(His love for Seok Jin is destroyed.)

1837
01:03:45,440 --> 01:03:47,319
- Be quiet. - Be quiet.

1838
01:03:47,369 --> 01:03:49,339
Be quiet, Haha.

1839
01:03:49,340 --> 01:03:50,420
Just be quiet.

1840
01:03:51,179 --> 01:03:54,180
It's because my leg is too long.

1841
01:03:55,650 --> 01:03:57,109
(Shall we cheat a little too?)

1842
01:03:57,110 --> 01:03:58,494
Why doesn't it work when it worked before?

1843
01:03:58,619 --> 01:03:59,933
It should come down.

1844
01:04:01,150 --> 01:04:03,574
- It worked before. - It passed.

1845
01:04:03,989 --> 01:04:05,302
(Slapping)

1846
01:04:06,190 --> 01:04:08,715
(He catches their cheating.)

1847
01:04:09,260 --> 01:04:11,421
It's our team's business.

1848
01:04:11,500 --> 01:04:14,025
You pushed it in too much.

1849
01:04:14,599 --> 01:04:16,791
- I'm sorry. I didn't know. - What are you doing?

1850
01:04:17,599 --> 01:04:19,993
- It's right here. - Yes, it's right there.

1851
01:04:20,139 --> 01:04:22,534
(Ji Hyo is about to feed Seok Jin.)

1852
01:04:22,809 --> 01:04:24,022
- Eat it. - Goodness.

1853
01:04:24,539 --> 01:04:25,549
I got it.

1854
01:04:26,179 --> 01:04:27,392
A little bit closer.

1855
01:04:27,610 --> 01:04:28,979
(Jong Kook's bread descends vertically.)

1856
01:04:28,980 --> 01:04:30,020
It came down.

1857
01:04:30,309 --> 01:04:31,718
(He takes his last bite with all his might.)

1858
01:04:31,719 --> 01:04:33,649
- It's coming. - Come on.

1859
01:04:33,650 --> 01:04:34,730
Okay.

1860
01:04:34,820 --> 01:04:37,314
- Eat the long piece. - Suck it in.

1861
01:04:38,159 --> 01:04:39,906
(Chew it quickly.)

1862
01:04:40,760 --> 01:04:42,982
(Pull it, Team Leader.)

1863
01:04:43,329 --> 01:04:44,799
(At that time)

1864
01:04:44,800 --> 01:04:46,749
(Jong Kook tears it.)

1865
01:04:47,500 --> 01:04:49,229
(The champion wins.)

1866
01:04:49,230 --> 01:04:50,714
Okay!

1867
01:04:51,239 --> 01:04:52,638
You got it.

1868
01:04:52,639 --> 01:04:54,368
- You're sweating. - Jong Kook.

1869
01:04:54,369 --> 01:04:56,009
(We'll take you home.)

1870
01:04:56,010 --> 01:04:57,081
Good job.

1871
01:04:57,210 --> 01:04:59,408
(My leg hurts.)

1872
01:04:59,409 --> 01:05:00,509
(Massaging)

1873
01:05:00,510 --> 01:05:02,379
- My goodness. - That's impressive.

1874
01:05:02,380 --> 01:05:04,067
It didn't come off.

1875
01:05:04,349 --> 01:05:06,618
I didn't know Jong Kook liked bread so much.

1876
01:05:06,619 --> 01:05:07,761
(He gets annoying.)

1877
01:05:07,820 --> 01:05:10,214
(He forces a new palate on him.)

1878
01:05:10,789 --> 01:05:12,809
Jong Kook is enjoying the bread.

1879
01:05:13,019 --> 01:05:14,828
Why did you eat chicken breast until now?

1880
01:05:14,829 --> 01:05:16,344
(You turned into a lover of bread.)

1881
01:05:17,289 --> 01:05:19,459
(Despite Seok Jin's efforts, the champion wins.)

1882
01:05:19,460 --> 01:05:21,620
The winner of the third round is...

1883
01:05:21,670 --> 01:05:22,868
Team Champion.

1884
01:05:22,869 --> 01:05:23,868
Okay.

1885
01:05:23,869 --> 01:05:26,162
(It's the first win for Team Champion.)

1886
01:05:26,440 --> 01:05:27,738
They didn't bet four, did they?

1887
01:05:27,739 --> 01:05:29,169
That's impossible.

1888
01:05:29,170 --> 01:05:32,473
How many roulette slots did Jong Kook bet?

1889
01:05:32,980 --> 01:05:36,308
(How many slots will Team Champion gain?)

1890
01:05:36,309 --> 01:05:37,348
It's two slots.

1891
01:05:37,349 --> 01:05:39,319
(Team Champion wins 2 slots.)

1892
01:05:39,320 --> 01:05:41,470
(We're still way ahead.)

1893
01:05:41,719 --> 01:05:43,018
- They did well. - So Min.

1894
01:05:43,019 --> 01:05:44,759
The current total is...

1895
01:05:44,760 --> 01:05:47,961
Team Ace has 9 slots. Team Champion has 3 slots.

1896
01:05:48,559 --> 01:05:49,928
They're not even close.

1897
01:05:49,929 --> 01:05:51,475
Why do they have so little?

1898
01:05:51,800 --> 01:05:54,669
- It's okay. - Next is the last round.

1899
01:05:54,670 --> 01:05:55,899
- Let's go. - We can do it.

1900
01:05:55,900 --> 01:05:57,738
I'll bet my life.

1901
01:05:57,739 --> 01:05:59,083
(Who will be the winner?)

1902
01:06:00,139 --> 01:06:01,138
It's the last round.

1903
01:06:01,139 --> 01:06:03,609
Okay, it's the last. If we win this round,

1904
01:06:03,610 --> 01:06:05,879
we'll be one step closer to LA.

1905
01:06:05,880 --> 01:06:08,001
- That's true. - It's getting better.

1906
01:06:08,909 --> 01:06:11,445
Ace versus the Champion, La La Land Race.

1907
01:06:11,619 --> 01:06:14,104
It's the last round for a trip to LA as a prize.

1908
01:06:14,190 --> 01:06:15,988
Trust Me Half Way.

1909
01:06:15,989 --> 01:06:18,585
(Trust Me Half Way)

1910
01:06:19,460 --> 01:06:21,611
(Ace versus the Champion, Round 3)

1911
01:06:21,659 --> 01:06:24,224
Within the limited time, cut the given ingredient...

1912
01:06:24,260 --> 01:06:26,229
exactly in half.

1913
01:06:26,230 --> 01:06:28,491
The person who is more accurate wins.

1914
01:06:28,869 --> 01:06:31,870
You win two points if you cut it exactly in half.

1915
01:06:32,500 --> 01:06:33,510
Two points?

1916
01:06:34,739 --> 01:06:36,153
- Cut it exactly? - Really?

1917
01:06:36,239 --> 01:06:39,139
It's important to estimate well.

1918
01:06:39,280 --> 01:06:41,149
Everyone, this game is...

1919
01:06:41,150 --> 01:06:43,231
currently very popular abroad.

1920
01:06:43,610 --> 01:06:45,569
- It's popular. - Many people play this?

1921
01:06:45,880 --> 01:06:48,344
- Okay. - We must win insider game too.

1922
01:06:48,650 --> 01:06:50,819
For the first round,

1923
01:06:50,820 --> 01:06:53,759
pick a player from your team.

1924
01:06:53,760 --> 01:06:54,799
Who shall play first?

1925
01:06:55,190 --> 01:06:56,629
- Shall I go first? - Yes, go, Se Chan.

1926
01:06:56,630 --> 01:06:57,669
I'll start.

1927
01:06:57,760 --> 01:06:58,799
- How about Seok Jin? - I'll go.

1928
01:06:58,800 --> 01:06:59,810
Okay.

1929
01:07:00,159 --> 01:07:03,229
First round is Seok Jin versus Se Chan.

1930
01:07:03,500 --> 01:07:05,138
Here's the first ingredient.

1931
01:07:05,139 --> 01:07:06,857
Please bring the ingredient.

1932
01:07:07,500 --> 01:07:08,581
What could it be?

1933
01:07:08,769 --> 01:07:09,768
What's that?

1934
01:07:09,769 --> 01:07:11,022
(Surprised)

1935
01:07:11,510 --> 01:07:14,308
- They're eggplant. - That's good.

1936
01:07:15,449 --> 01:07:17,873
- The top and bottom are different. - Right.

1937
01:07:18,349 --> 01:07:19,864
I need to find the center of gravity.

1938
01:07:21,150 --> 01:07:23,745
Look how scientific Seok Jin is.

1939
01:07:23,989 --> 01:07:26,817
You have one minute from now.

1940
01:07:27,090 --> 01:07:30,059
Put the halves on the scales in one minute.

1941
01:07:30,489 --> 01:07:31,510
Get ready.

1942
01:07:32,329 --> 01:07:33,512
Start.

1943
01:07:33,566 --> 01:07:38,566
<font color="#fcc89b">[VIU Ver] SBS E438 Running Man</font>
<font color="#ff80ff">"the Ace versus the Champion"</font>
<font color="#ff5fa2">-♥ Ruo Xi ♥-</font>

1944
01:07:38,639 --> 01:07:42,246
(They both try to find the center of gravity.)

1945
01:07:42,610 --> 01:07:44,599
(Weighing)

1946
01:07:44,980 --> 01:07:47,649
(At that time)

1947
01:07:47,650 --> 01:07:49,326
This is it, but the left side is a bit heavier.

1948
01:07:49,880 --> 01:07:50,991
Seok Jin put it on his finger.

1949
01:07:51,420 --> 01:07:53,268
Seok Jin found the center.

1950
01:07:53,320 --> 01:07:55,168
He's like someone at KAIST.

1951
01:07:55,949 --> 01:07:57,030
Someone at NASA.

1952
01:07:58,360 --> 01:07:59,788
(Why can't I find the center of gravity?)

1953
01:07:59,789 --> 01:08:01,042
I'll try to guess.

1954
01:08:02,889 --> 01:08:04,717
- Here he goes. - Here he goes.

1955
01:08:05,400 --> 01:08:07,116
(I got it.)

1956
01:08:07,769 --> 01:08:08,999
You have 10 seconds left.

1957
01:08:09,000 --> 01:08:10,646
- 10 seconds. - 9.

1958
01:08:10,829 --> 01:08:11,850
- 8. - 8.

1959
01:08:12,070 --> 01:08:14,090
(Se Chan starts to cut as well.)

1960
01:08:14,969 --> 01:08:16,709
(Let's go, Seok Jin. Let's go, Se Chan.)

1961
01:08:16,710 --> 01:08:17,709
- 3. - 3.

1962
01:08:17,710 --> 01:08:19,709
(Careful)

1963
01:08:19,710 --> 01:08:23,446
(Seok Jin cuts confidently while Se Chan cuts carefully.)

1964
01:08:23,909 --> 01:08:25,768
Okay, you'll put it up 1 by 1.

1965
01:08:27,719 --> 01:08:29,089
Why did you cut it slanted?

1966
01:08:29,090 --> 01:08:32,288
(Wait a minute, why did you cut it slanted?)

1967
01:08:32,289 --> 01:08:33,632
That one is very slanted.

1968
01:08:33,920 --> 01:08:35,607
- Did you slice it diagonally? - Wait.

1969
01:08:36,230 --> 01:08:38,582
Why did you cut it slanted?

1970
01:08:39,099 --> 01:08:40,715
At least he didn't cut his finger.

1971
01:08:42,199 --> 01:08:44,361
It's very slanted.

1972
01:08:44,699 --> 01:08:47,038
Seok Jin will put them on the scales.

1973
01:08:47,039 --> 01:08:48,928
- Put them 1 by 1. - This one is heavier.

1974
01:08:49,069 --> 01:08:50,709
(Seok Jin's first eggplant's weight)

1975
01:08:50,710 --> 01:08:51,738
1 by 1.

1976
01:08:51,739 --> 01:08:52,821
It's exactly 70g.

1977
01:08:53,279 --> 01:08:54,289
Okay.

1978
01:08:54,909 --> 01:08:57,071
We don't know yet.

1979
01:08:57,180 --> 01:08:58,349
- We don't know. - Here I go.

1980
01:08:58,350 --> 01:08:59,379
I'll do this one.

1981
01:08:59,380 --> 01:09:01,919
(Se Chan's first eggplant's weight)

1982
01:09:01,920 --> 01:09:03,618
It's 66g.

1983
01:09:03,619 --> 01:09:05,089
That sounds good.

1984
01:09:05,090 --> 01:09:06,877
The sizes are similar. It's good.

1985
01:09:07,090 --> 01:09:09,282
- It'd be amazing if it's 70g. - That'd be amazing.

1986
01:09:09,789 --> 01:09:10,972
Let's see.

1987
01:09:11,829 --> 01:09:12,858
Let's see.

1988
01:09:12,859 --> 01:09:15,394
(How much does Seok Jin's second eggplant weigh?)

1989
01:09:15,500 --> 01:09:19,299
(The closer it is to 70g, he has a higher chance of winning.)

1990
01:09:19,300 --> 01:09:20,410
Let's see.

1991
01:09:21,710 --> 01:09:22,868
It's 60g.

1992
01:09:22,869 --> 01:09:24,021
The difference is 10g.

1993
01:09:25,210 --> 01:09:27,775
(Is the result 10g?)

1994
01:09:28,779 --> 01:09:30,578
- Why? - We don't know yet.

1995
01:09:30,579 --> 01:09:31,719
66g sounds good.

1996
01:09:31,720 --> 01:09:33,740
(Seok Jin's result is disappointing.)

1997
01:09:34,020 --> 01:09:35,019
I'll put it on.

1998
01:09:35,020 --> 01:09:37,448
(How much does Se Chan's second eggplant weigh?)

1999
01:09:37,449 --> 01:09:43,418
(If the difference is less than 10g, Se Chan wins.)

2000
01:09:45,399 --> 01:09:48,068
(Se Chan's difference is 2g.)

2001
01:09:48,069 --> 01:09:49,528
- Okay. - That was good.

2002
01:09:49,529 --> 01:09:51,398
(Is the difference really 2g?)

2003
01:09:51,399 --> 01:09:53,868
- Okay, it's 2g. - My goodness.

2004
01:09:53,869 --> 01:09:55,438
(Se Chan wins.)

2005
01:09:55,439 --> 01:09:56,669
- Did I do well? - You did.

2006
01:09:56,670 --> 01:09:57,992
- Tell me. - Good job.

2007
01:09:58,510 --> 01:10:00,738
(He cut it so well.)

2008
01:10:00,739 --> 01:10:03,102
- Se Chan wins the first round. - Okay.

2009
01:10:03,149 --> 01:10:05,544
- Okay. - I didn't have high expectations.

2010
01:10:05,819 --> 01:10:07,234
Our team is coming back.

2011
01:10:07,579 --> 01:10:09,134
- Scores tie if we win one more. - Who's next?

2012
01:10:10,090 --> 01:10:11,118
So Min or Kwang Soo?

2013
01:10:11,119 --> 01:10:12,503
- I'll go. - Okay, So Min.

2014
01:10:12,720 --> 01:10:14,788
- Who's next? - I'll go.

2015
01:10:14,789 --> 01:10:15,788
Haha.

2016
01:10:15,789 --> 01:10:17,546
- Cut it slowly. - I'm too anxious.

2017
01:10:17,930 --> 01:10:19,414
- That was so close. - Do it, Haha.

2018
01:10:19,899 --> 01:10:22,193
- It's Haha. - You're in the restaurant business.

2019
01:10:23,369 --> 01:10:25,319
However, I don't go in the kitchen.

2020
01:10:25,569 --> 01:10:27,387
Here's the second ingredient.

2021
01:10:27,500 --> 01:10:28,722
I hope it's an easy one.

2022
01:10:29,010 --> 01:10:30,182
That one is...

2023
01:10:30,409 --> 01:10:31,652
- What is it? - What?

2024
01:10:32,180 --> 01:10:33,523
What is it? Is it gimbap?

2025
01:10:34,140 --> 01:10:35,524
This one is difficult.

2026
01:10:35,710 --> 01:10:37,871
- Goodness. - The inside is protruding.

2027
01:10:37,920 --> 01:10:40,910
It's important where the rice is.

2028
01:10:41,319 --> 01:10:43,844
The timer will start. You have one minute.

2029
01:10:44,989 --> 01:10:46,778
It's nothing, but it's not easy.

2030
01:10:46,960 --> 01:10:48,848
- It makes us focused. - I'm nervous.

2031
01:10:49,560 --> 01:10:50,600
Trust your feeling.

2032
01:10:51,329 --> 01:10:54,187
- I went to many gimbap restaurants. - That's good.

2033
01:10:54,529 --> 01:10:55,913
I'm nervous.

2034
01:10:56,829 --> 01:10:57,910
This is interesting.

2035
01:10:58,100 --> 01:11:00,392
Try to feel the weight with the finger.

2036
01:11:00,439 --> 01:11:01,469
Adjust it.

2037
01:11:01,470 --> 01:11:03,428
If you squeeze it more, gimbap might burst.

2038
01:11:04,210 --> 01:11:05,725
- You'll be in trouble. - Right.

2039
01:11:05,779 --> 01:11:07,908
All right. 10, 9.

2040
01:11:07,909 --> 01:11:09,091
You have to decide.

2041
01:11:09,180 --> 01:11:10,309
- Decide, Haha. - Eight.

2042
01:11:10,310 --> 01:11:12,199
(Haha takes the knife.)

2043
01:11:13,079 --> 01:11:14,849
- Do it slowly. - Take your time.

2044
01:11:14,850 --> 01:11:16,032
(I'll show you what it means to work in the restaurant business.)

2045
01:11:16,489 --> 01:11:18,439
- I think this is it. - It is.

2046
01:11:18,489 --> 01:11:20,742
- You have to cut it carefully. - Cut it well.

2047
01:11:20,960 --> 01:11:23,211
- Cut it straight. - Cut it carefully.

2048
01:11:23,359 --> 01:11:25,248
- That's right. - Right.

2049
01:11:25,300 --> 01:11:26,915
- You got it. - It's neat.

2050
01:11:27,000 --> 01:11:28,769
That's right.

2051
01:11:28,770 --> 01:11:30,587
- You got it. - That was great.

2052
01:11:30,630 --> 01:11:31,839
You got it, So Min.

2053
01:11:31,840 --> 01:11:32,999
That's right.

2054
01:11:33,000 --> 01:11:34,756
(Slicing)

2055
01:11:35,140 --> 01:11:36,139
It's done.

2056
01:11:36,140 --> 01:11:38,309
(Haha shows his meticulous cutting.)

2057
01:11:38,310 --> 01:11:40,478
Let's start with Haha.

2058
01:11:40,479 --> 01:11:41,792
Put it on the scale.

2059
01:11:41,949 --> 01:11:43,192
- This is... - Right?

2060
01:11:43,949 --> 01:11:44,989
You did a good job.

2061
01:11:45,180 --> 01:11:47,478
(Haha's first gimbap's weight)

2062
01:11:47,479 --> 01:11:49,004
- 144g. - 144g.

2063
01:11:51,189 --> 01:11:52,704
- This looks heavier. - It's okay.

2064
01:11:52,960 --> 01:11:54,404
This one looks heavier too.

2065
01:11:55,189 --> 01:11:56,488
It just seems that way.

2066
01:11:56,489 --> 01:11:57,559
(So Min's first gimbap's weight)

2067
01:11:57,560 --> 01:11:58,772
Why are there two grains of rice?

2068
01:11:59,460 --> 01:12:00,671
134g.

2069
01:12:00,800 --> 01:12:02,068
- It's okay. - His was 144g.

2070
01:12:02,069 --> 01:12:05,201
- Both gimbap don't weigh the same. - No.

2071
01:12:05,369 --> 01:12:06,379
Weigh the other one.

2072
01:12:07,439 --> 01:12:10,438
(It's time to weigh the second piece.)

2073
01:12:10,439 --> 01:12:12,478
(Will the 2nd one weigh close to 144g?)

2074
01:12:12,479 --> 01:12:13,809
You're in the restaurant business.

2075
01:12:13,810 --> 01:12:16,537
(With Haha's senses)

2076
01:12:17,279 --> 01:12:18,419
- It's 136g. - 136g.

2077
01:12:18,420 --> 01:12:19,430
(Haha's difference is 8g.)

2078
01:12:19,949 --> 01:12:21,019
It's 136g.

2079
01:12:21,020 --> 01:12:22,767
(8g is a little risky.)

2080
01:12:22,949 --> 01:12:25,716
This is difficult. It's hard.

2081
01:12:26,289 --> 01:12:28,108
- Is it me? - It should be in 130s.

2082
01:12:28,159 --> 01:12:30,089
If it's 8g, we have a chance to win.

2083
01:12:30,090 --> 01:12:32,759
(How much does So Min's second gimbap weigh?)

2084
01:12:32,760 --> 01:12:33,898
Here we go, So Min.

2085
01:12:33,899 --> 01:12:34,999
You got it.

2086
01:12:35,000 --> 01:12:40,928
(So Min wins if the difference is less than 8g.)

2087
01:12:43,109 --> 01:12:45,432
- It's 136g. - It's 2g.

2088
01:12:45,680 --> 01:12:48,009
(The difference is 2g again.)

2089
01:12:48,010 --> 01:12:49,648
- The difference keeps being 2g. - 2g.

2090
01:12:49,649 --> 01:12:50,892
(So Min wins.)

2091
01:12:50,909 --> 01:12:52,838
- My goodness. - Why are they so good?

2092
01:12:53,619 --> 01:12:55,249
Okay, I'll go this time.

2093
01:12:55,250 --> 01:12:56,703
- Jae Seok? - I'll do it, Ji Hyo.

2094
01:12:56,890 --> 01:12:57,959
If you lose, it's over.

2095
01:12:57,960 --> 01:12:59,158
(If Team Ace loses again, they lose Round 3.)

2096
01:12:59,159 --> 01:13:00,300
- Kwang Soo. - That's right.

2097
01:13:00,489 --> 01:13:03,419
- Let's keep going. - Kwang Soo is good at it.

2098
01:13:04,390 --> 01:13:05,409
It isn't easy.

2099
01:13:05,560 --> 01:13:08,599
(Stop right there, Team Champion. Here comes the game expert.)

2100
01:13:08,600 --> 01:13:09,610
Sir.

2101
01:13:10,600 --> 01:13:12,760
(It's a war of nerves.)

2102
01:13:13,199 --> 01:13:14,381
He's a troublemaker.

2103
01:13:14,470 --> 01:13:15,823
Don't stab each other.

2104
01:13:16,039 --> 01:13:17,887
Here's the third ingredient.

2105
01:13:18,539 --> 01:13:20,038
- This one is difficult. - It's difficult.

2106
01:13:20,039 --> 01:13:22,448
- Here's the third ingredient. - This one is difficult.

2107
01:13:22,449 --> 01:13:23,489
It's difficult.

2108
01:13:24,250 --> 01:13:25,289
Goodness.

2109
01:13:26,079 --> 01:13:27,419
This one is too difficult.

2110
01:13:27,420 --> 01:13:28,500
Come on.

2111
01:13:29,090 --> 01:13:32,351
- It has a strange shape. - The shape isn't smooth.

2112
01:13:33,260 --> 01:13:34,370
It's cabbage.

2113
01:13:34,829 --> 01:13:35,839
It's difficult.

2114
01:13:36,430 --> 01:13:37,702
This one is too difficult.

2115
01:13:38,229 --> 01:13:39,340
How is it possible?

2116
01:13:39,430 --> 01:13:40,975
If your cut is slanted...

2117
01:13:42,000 --> 01:13:43,769
Do I have to cut it once with a knife?

2118
01:13:43,770 --> 01:13:44,810
Yes.

2119
01:13:44,899 --> 01:13:45,909
All right.

2120
01:13:46,039 --> 01:13:48,408
One minute on the clock starts now.

2121
01:13:48,409 --> 01:13:49,521
It's too difficult.

2122
01:13:50,039 --> 01:13:51,169
How do I do it?

2123
01:13:51,170 --> 01:13:52,452
- Is there a method? - It's difficult.

2124
01:13:52,579 --> 01:13:53,993
I can't find the middle either.

2125
01:13:54,409 --> 01:13:55,521
The shape is not even.

2126
01:13:55,550 --> 01:13:56,722
My goodness.

2127
01:13:57,079 --> 01:13:58,767
It's hard to find the center.

2128
01:13:59,949 --> 01:14:01,988
Shall I apply the Pythagorean theorem?

2129
01:14:01,989 --> 01:14:05,150
(Is he that educated?)

2130
01:14:05,560 --> 01:14:07,408
I'll use Newton's Laws.

2131
01:14:07,920 --> 01:14:08,970
"Newton's Laws"?

2132
01:14:09,229 --> 01:14:10,673
You should apply Murphy's law.

2133
01:14:11,189 --> 01:14:12,411
"Murphy's law"?

2134
01:14:13,029 --> 01:14:14,769
- It's confusing. - Isn't it protruding this way?

2135
01:14:14,770 --> 01:14:16,184
How about here?

2136
01:14:16,300 --> 01:14:17,429
There's no way.

2137
01:14:17,430 --> 01:14:19,117
Don't talk to him. Just trust your feeling.

2138
01:14:19,300 --> 01:14:20,855
Trust your feeling, Jae Seok.

2139
01:14:22,310 --> 01:14:23,482
(Kwang Soo searches with Newton's Laws.)

2140
01:14:23,539 --> 01:14:25,227
If you pin it, it will balance.

2141
01:14:25,279 --> 01:14:26,724
Wait.

2142
01:14:26,840 --> 01:14:28,798
- Don't make marks with the knife. - Don't do that.

2143
01:14:29,210 --> 01:14:30,448
Kwang Soo.

2144
01:14:30,449 --> 01:14:31,631
Don't make marks with the knife.

2145
01:14:32,149 --> 01:14:33,634
- Kwang Soo. - He cut it.

2146
01:14:34,050 --> 01:14:35,519
- He cut it. - What are you doing?

2147
01:14:35,520 --> 01:14:37,249
- You have to cut it right there. - Kwang Soo.

2148
01:14:37,250 --> 01:14:38,488
(What?)

2149
01:14:38,489 --> 01:14:40,004
What are you doing?

2150
01:14:40,920 --> 01:14:42,000
- Kwang Soo. - 10 seconds?

2151
01:14:42,590 --> 01:14:43,688
(It's time to cut it.)

2152
01:14:43,689 --> 01:14:45,619
- I'll slice it. - It's based on luck.

2153
01:14:46,199 --> 01:14:47,328
Cut well in the middle.

2154
01:14:47,329 --> 01:14:50,096
The one who cuts it well will win. Watch out.

2155
01:14:50,399 --> 01:14:51,481
It's too slanted.

2156
01:14:51,739 --> 01:14:54,224
You should cut it a little slanted.

2157
01:14:54,939 --> 01:14:56,669
- He cut it. - It's already done.

2158
01:14:56,670 --> 01:14:58,009
(There's no turning back.)

2159
01:14:58,010 --> 01:15:00,030
- Turn to the left. - To the left.

2160
01:15:00,510 --> 01:15:02,297
- To the left. - Yes, cut straight.

2161
01:15:03,149 --> 01:15:04,209
Just cut it.

2162
01:15:04,210 --> 01:15:06,098
- Okay, I got it. - He cut it well.

2163
01:15:06,380 --> 01:15:07,460
Everyone.

2164
01:15:07,619 --> 01:15:09,610
- Jae Seok, put it on first. - Goodness.

2165
01:15:09,920 --> 01:15:11,148
It's done.

2166
01:15:11,149 --> 01:15:13,358
- They weigh about the same. - Some fell off.

2167
01:15:13,359 --> 01:15:14,844
(Wait, some fell off.)

2168
01:15:15,659 --> 01:15:16,828
Put them on here.

2169
01:15:16,829 --> 01:15:17,971
They fell off.

2170
01:15:18,960 --> 01:15:20,071
Are you ready?

2171
01:15:20,199 --> 01:15:21,483
They weigh about the same.

2172
01:15:21,600 --> 01:15:22,640
If we lose, is it over?

2173
01:15:23,470 --> 01:15:26,025
If they weigh the same, you get two points.

2174
01:15:26,300 --> 01:15:28,238
- Put it on, Jae Seok. - Gosh.

2175
01:15:28,239 --> 01:15:30,128
(Will Jae Seok save his team?)

2176
01:15:30,170 --> 01:15:33,339
(Jae Seok's first cabbage's weight)

2177
01:15:33,340 --> 01:15:35,478
- It's 1,192g. - 1,192g.

2178
01:15:35,479 --> 01:15:36,620
Does it weigh 1kg?

2179
01:15:37,109 --> 01:15:38,261
All right, Kwang Soo.

2180
01:15:38,550 --> 01:15:40,148
Put it on, Kwang Soo.

2181
01:15:40,149 --> 01:15:43,448
(Kwang Soo's first cabbage's weight)

2182
01:15:43,449 --> 01:15:45,914
It's 1,278g. Jae Seok?

2183
01:15:45,989 --> 01:15:48,389
It's okay. We don't know who won.

2184
01:15:48,390 --> 01:15:49,559
(No one knows who the winner is.)

2185
01:15:49,560 --> 01:15:52,256
(They weigh the first piece of cabbage.)

2186
01:15:52,300 --> 01:15:53,541
If you think they're similar, you're right.

2187
01:15:54,359 --> 01:15:57,868
(The problem is the weight of the second piece.)

2188
01:15:57,869 --> 01:16:01,839
(How much does Jae Seok's second cabbage weigh?)

2189
01:16:01,840 --> 01:16:05,142
(The closer it is to 1,192g, he has a higher chance of winning.)

2190
01:16:05,979 --> 01:16:08,130
It's 1,254g. You did well.

2191
01:16:08,279 --> 01:16:09,278
It's not bad.

2192
01:16:09,279 --> 01:16:11,478
- You did well. - It's not bad.

2193
01:16:11,479 --> 01:16:12,530
It isn't bad, right?

2194
01:16:12,949 --> 01:16:14,909
- It's 62g. - The difference is 62g.

2195
01:16:15,020 --> 01:16:17,444
- Ours will be... - Kwang Soo's was 1,278g.

2196
01:16:17,520 --> 01:16:19,089
- It's a bit heavier. - I think so.

2197
01:16:19,090 --> 01:16:22,228
(If the difference is less than 62g, Team Champion wins.)

2198
01:16:22,229 --> 01:16:25,099
(Will Kwang Soo lead his team to victory?)

2199
01:16:25,100 --> 01:16:28,099
(Let's see how Team Champion does.)

2200
01:16:31,539 --> 01:16:32,938
- What? - What is it?

2201
01:16:32,939 --> 01:16:34,414
(Kwang Soo's difference is 68g.)

2202
01:16:34,840 --> 01:16:36,408
(Did we lose?)

2203
01:16:36,409 --> 01:16:37,924
- What's the difference? - 6g.

2204
01:16:38,010 --> 01:16:39,009
Did we win?

2205
01:16:39,010 --> 01:16:40,858
- We won. - Jae Seok won.

2206
01:16:40,909 --> 01:16:42,829
Okay, okay.

2207
01:16:43,079 --> 01:16:44,796
- Okay. - Good job.

2208
01:16:44,850 --> 01:16:46,234
It was difficult.

2209
01:16:46,479 --> 01:16:47,679
This saved us.

2210
01:16:47,680 --> 01:16:48,932
It was difficult.

2211
01:16:49,819 --> 01:16:51,162
- It's okay. - You did well.

2212
01:16:51,289 --> 01:16:53,380
- It couldn't be helped. - Good job.

2213
01:16:54,119 --> 01:16:55,589
If Ji Hyo wins, we go to the final round.

2214
01:16:55,590 --> 01:16:56,889
- Ji Hyo. - Let's go.

2215
01:16:56,890 --> 01:16:58,747
(Only two players remain.)

2216
01:16:59,300 --> 01:17:00,977
- It's a match between team leaders. - Yes.

2217
01:17:01,159 --> 01:17:02,999
- All right. - Let's go.

2218
01:17:03,000 --> 01:17:05,495
- Let's go. - If Jong Kook wins, game is over.

2219
01:17:05,539 --> 01:17:07,099
If Ji Hyo wins, we go to Round Five.

2220
01:17:07,100 --> 01:17:08,755
- Let's go, Ji Hyo. - Let's go.

2221
01:17:08,810 --> 01:17:09,969
Let's go to LA.

2222
01:17:09,970 --> 01:17:11,809
(What will be their ingredient?)

2223
01:17:11,810 --> 01:17:13,122
Next ingredient is...

2224
01:17:13,680 --> 01:17:14,709
eggs.

2225
01:17:14,710 --> 01:17:16,326
- Eggs? - Boiled eggs?

2226
01:17:16,550 --> 01:17:17,778
This one is difficult.

2227
01:17:17,779 --> 01:17:18,931
It's cooked.

2228
01:17:19,449 --> 01:17:21,318
(The ingredient is fragile.)

2229
01:17:21,319 --> 01:17:22,865
- How is it possible? - It's cooked.

2230
01:17:23,649 --> 01:17:24,933
It's dented.

2231
01:17:25,789 --> 01:17:27,459
(Key is that it's dented.)

2232
01:17:27,460 --> 01:17:29,812
How can you cut this in half?

2233
01:17:29,930 --> 01:17:31,759
Jong Kook has touched them countless times.

2234
01:17:31,760 --> 01:17:32,759
- Jong Kook. - But...

2235
01:17:32,760 --> 01:17:34,028
- You must have an idea. - This is a different matter.

2236
01:17:34,029 --> 01:17:36,499
It's a matter of figuring out...

2237
01:17:36,500 --> 01:17:37,528
- where the yolk leans. - That's right.

2238
01:17:37,529 --> 01:17:38,799
- Yes. - She is right.

2239
01:17:38,800 --> 01:17:41,365
The yolk could lean heavily to one side.

2240
01:17:41,710 --> 01:17:43,269
Ji Hyo, feel it lightly.

2241
01:17:43,270 --> 01:17:45,259
- Think about the shape. - You have a minute.

2242
01:17:46,279 --> 01:17:48,532
(The last round starts.)

2243
01:17:49,979 --> 01:17:52,374
Staring at it won't help you.

2244
01:17:52,420 --> 01:17:53,895
- She took the knife right away. - You can't go back once it's in.

2245
01:17:55,250 --> 01:17:56,703
Ji Hyo, go with your gut feeling.

2246
01:17:56,989 --> 01:17:58,358
There is no other way.

2247
01:17:58,359 --> 01:17:59,788
(Ji Hyo moves in with a knife.)

2248
01:17:59,789 --> 01:18:01,173
This is really hard.

2249
01:18:01,659 --> 01:18:02,871
Eggs are hard.

2250
01:18:02,930 --> 01:18:04,647
You can't make it stand.

2251
01:18:05,130 --> 01:18:07,322
(It's tricky.)

2252
01:18:08,159 --> 01:18:09,698
Move it a bit to the left.

2253
01:18:09,699 --> 01:18:11,368
- Ji Hyo is cutting it. - Is she cutting it already?

2254
01:18:11,369 --> 01:18:13,460
(At that moment)

2255
01:18:13,970 --> 01:18:15,309
- She is cutting it. - I can see the yolk.

2256
01:18:15,310 --> 01:18:17,865
- She is cutting it. - The left side seems a bit bigger.

2257
01:18:17,939 --> 01:18:19,478
Forget it. It's over.

2258
01:18:19,479 --> 01:18:20,778
- Go with it. - Which side has more yolk?

2259
01:18:20,779 --> 01:18:22,379
She cut it nearly in half.

2260
01:18:22,380 --> 01:18:23,460
I think she cut it nearly in half.

2261
01:18:24,109 --> 01:18:25,879
Ji Hyo cut it really well.

2262
01:18:25,880 --> 01:18:26,919
All right.

2263
01:18:26,920 --> 01:18:28,488
(Jong Kook was using the original tactics.)

2264
01:18:28,489 --> 01:18:29,849
- Jong Kook, the yolk... - I lost some of it.

2265
01:18:29,850 --> 01:18:31,019
It shouldn't be sticking out.

2266
01:18:31,020 --> 01:18:32,059
It lost some of it.

2267
01:18:32,060 --> 01:18:33,858
Why is there so much yolk on the knife?

2268
01:18:33,859 --> 01:18:36,384
(Why is there so much yolk on the knife?)

2269
01:18:36,789 --> 01:18:37,839
- What is this? - You got this.

2270
01:18:38,300 --> 01:18:39,299
- Gosh. - Let's go.

2271
01:18:39,300 --> 01:18:41,795
- Ji Hyo, put a piece on the scale. - We won.

2272
01:18:41,970 --> 01:18:43,445
- I think we lost. - Put a piece on the scale.

2273
01:18:43,800 --> 01:18:44,810
We won.

2274
01:18:46,140 --> 01:18:47,139
(What's the weight of the 1st half of Ji Hyo's egg?)

2275
01:18:47,140 --> 01:18:48,381
My goodness.

2276
01:18:48,739 --> 01:18:49,839
Put a piece on the scale.

2277
01:18:49,840 --> 01:18:51,238
(Ji Hyo's first egg’s weight)

2278
01:18:51,239 --> 01:18:52,391
18g.

2279
01:18:53,510 --> 01:18:55,065
- 18g. - I think we lost.

2280
01:18:55,350 --> 01:18:56,879
- I think we lost. - Ji Hyo.

2281
01:18:56,880 --> 01:18:58,078
We will put one on a scale.

2282
01:18:58,079 --> 01:18:59,160
Go ahead.

2283
01:19:00,720 --> 01:19:01,788
I think this one is heavy.

2284
01:19:01,789 --> 01:19:04,019
(Jong Kook’s first egg’s weight)

2285
01:19:04,020 --> 01:19:05,118
- I think this one is heavy. - 20g.

2286
01:19:05,119 --> 01:19:06,503
- It weighs 20g. - 20g.

2287
01:19:06,689 --> 01:19:09,759
Ji Hyo, put the second piece on the scale.

2288
01:19:11,659 --> 01:19:14,931
(Everything depends on the weight of the second half of her egg.)

2289
01:19:15,300 --> 01:19:17,320
If Ji Hyo wins, we will move on to the final round. Ji Hyo.

2290
01:19:17,529 --> 01:19:18,611
Let's go.

2291
01:19:19,399 --> 01:19:21,538
(What's the weight of the 2nd half of Ji Hyo's egg?)

2292
01:19:21,539 --> 01:19:22,751
Put the second piece on a scale.

2293
01:19:25,810 --> 01:19:27,038
20g. The difference is 2g.

2294
01:19:27,039 --> 01:19:28,038
- The difference is 2g. - We won.

2295
01:19:28,039 --> 01:19:29,249
She really is incredible.

2296
01:19:29,250 --> 01:19:31,299
(Ji Hyo really is incredible.)

2297
01:19:32,020 --> 01:19:33,837
If we win, we will have another round.

2298
01:19:33,949 --> 01:19:35,869
We won't be able to beat 2g.

2299
01:19:35,920 --> 01:19:37,263
You never know.

2300
01:19:37,289 --> 01:19:38,472
2g is...

2301
01:19:39,319 --> 01:19:42,521
(The 2nd half of Jong Kook's egg gets weighed.)

2302
01:19:42,960 --> 01:19:47,429
(If the difference is within 2g, Jong Kook will win.)

2303
01:19:47,430 --> 01:19:51,782
(What's the weight of the 2nd half of Jong Kook's egg?)

2304
01:19:55,470 --> 01:19:57,908
- What? It weighs 20g. - It weighs 20g.

2305
01:19:57,909 --> 01:19:58,990
20g.

2306
01:19:59,510 --> 01:20:01,772
20g! 20g!

2307
01:20:02,250 --> 01:20:03,866
(He cut it exactly in half.)

2308
01:20:04,609 --> 01:20:06,467
(The difference is 0g.)

2309
01:20:07,649 --> 01:20:09,002
We did it.

2310
01:20:09,319 --> 01:20:10,389
This is incredible.

2311
01:20:10,390 --> 01:20:12,589
(They can't help but admit defeat.)

2312
01:20:12,590 --> 01:20:14,389
We admit defeat.

2313
01:20:14,390 --> 01:20:16,129
- This is incredible. - My goodness.

2314
01:20:16,130 --> 01:20:18,110
The yolk on the knife did it.

2315
01:20:18,529 --> 01:20:20,999
- Seriously. - The yolk on the knife did it.

2316
01:20:21,000 --> 01:20:23,554
- We would have lost otherwise. - Seriously.

2317
01:20:24,229 --> 01:20:25,816
How is this possible?

2318
01:20:26,670 --> 01:20:27,969
We won two points.

2319
01:20:27,970 --> 01:20:29,108
(Team Champion gets 2 points.)

2320
01:20:29,109 --> 01:20:30,608
I can't believe it.

2321
01:20:30,609 --> 01:20:32,639
- How can it weigh 20g? - We admit defeat.

2322
01:20:32,640 --> 01:20:33,822
(The final score is 4 to 1.)

2323
01:20:34,210 --> 01:20:37,412
Team Champion gets five slots...

2324
01:20:37,779 --> 01:20:39,578
- and Team Ace gets one slot. - That's enough.

2325
01:20:39,579 --> 01:20:42,188
- Our chance is about the same. - It's enough.

2326
01:20:42,189 --> 01:20:45,089
- It's enough. - Team Ace has 10 slots...

2327
01:20:45,560 --> 01:20:46,959
and Team Champion has eight slots in total.

2328
01:20:46,960 --> 01:20:48,589
- Okay. We have more slots. - Our chance is about the same.

2329
01:20:48,590 --> 01:20:51,155
- It's enough. - We can do this.

2330
01:20:51,189 --> 01:20:52,411
It depends on luck.

2331
01:20:52,500 --> 01:20:54,499
Between the Ace and Champion, who will win?

2332
01:20:54,500 --> 01:20:56,398
I am curious about the result.

2333
01:20:56,399 --> 01:20:57,742
Who will be luckier?

2334
01:20:59,199 --> 01:21:00,599
The numbers are about the same, so let's take turns.

2335
01:21:00,600 --> 01:21:01,709
Okay.

2336
01:21:01,710 --> 01:21:03,759
(They fill up the slots on the final roulette.)

2337
01:21:04,039 --> 01:21:05,393
One slot at a time.

2338
01:21:06,279 --> 01:21:09,009
Between the Ace and Champion, who will win?

2339
01:21:09,010 --> 01:21:10,478
I am curious about the result.

2340
01:21:10,479 --> 01:21:12,019
Who will be luckier?

2341
01:21:12,020 --> 01:21:15,383
Ji Hyo is better with roulettes.

2342
01:21:15,720 --> 01:21:16,849
(Will it be Ji Hyo or Jong Kook?)

2343
01:21:16,850 --> 01:21:18,879
I am so nervous. I am so nervous.

2344
01:21:19,159 --> 01:21:20,988
- Okay. - There is no way of knowing.

2345
01:21:20,989 --> 01:21:22,429
Let's have three consecutive slots.

2346
01:21:22,430 --> 01:21:23,559
Gosh, that's...

2347
01:21:23,560 --> 01:21:25,198
That won't make us lose.

2348
01:21:25,199 --> 01:21:26,759
That might make us lose.

2349
01:21:26,760 --> 01:21:27,929
It will be incredible if it stops there.

2350
01:21:27,930 --> 01:21:29,469
- Goodness. - Okay.

2351
01:21:29,470 --> 01:21:31,550
I hope it stops at the three consecutive slots.

2352
01:21:31,670 --> 01:21:33,316
- It's a single take. - It's a single take, right?

2353
01:21:33,399 --> 01:21:34,538
- Spin it together. - Spin it together.

2354
01:21:34,539 --> 01:21:36,209
One should spin upward, and the other should spin downward.

2355
01:21:36,210 --> 01:21:37,839
Spin downward. I will spin upward.

2356
01:21:37,840 --> 01:21:39,022
Should I spin downward?

2357
01:21:39,939 --> 01:21:41,829
(How romantic!)

2358
01:21:42,710 --> 01:21:44,628
- What are you doing? - For goodness' sake.

2359
01:21:45,550 --> 01:21:47,337
- I will spin downward. - Spin downward. I will spin upward.

2360
01:21:48,550 --> 01:21:50,337
We get excited about the smallest things.

2361
01:21:50,420 --> 01:21:51,618
One.

2362
01:21:51,619 --> 01:21:53,438
(They still need to discern the winner.)

2363
01:21:53,720 --> 01:21:54,719
Two.

2364
01:21:54,720 --> 01:21:55,759
(The final round of Ace versus the Champion)

2365
01:21:55,760 --> 01:21:57,858
- Three. - Here it goes.

2366
01:21:57,859 --> 01:22:00,324
(They spun the final roulette together.)

2367
01:22:01,029 --> 01:22:02,068
Here it goes.

2368
01:22:02,069 --> 01:22:03,499
(Who will be chosen as the winner by the spirit of roulette?)

2369
01:22:03,500 --> 01:22:05,669
- I'm curious about the result. - I'm curious.

2370
01:22:05,670 --> 01:22:06,852
(Who will be chosen as the winner by the spirit of roulette?)

2371
01:22:08,239 --> 01:22:10,038
Ji Hyo. Ji Hyo.

2372
01:22:10,039 --> 01:22:11,408
- The three consecutive slots. - Ji Hyo.

2373
01:22:11,409 --> 01:22:12,679
(The roulette slows down.)

2374
01:22:12,680 --> 01:22:15,709
(Will the three consecutive slots be effective?)

2375
01:22:15,710 --> 01:22:17,093
- The three consecutive slots. - Ji Hyo.

2376
01:22:18,210 --> 01:22:21,249
(It passes Ji Hyo's three consecutive slots...)

2377
01:22:21,250 --> 01:22:25,019
(and goes towards the mixed slots.)

2378
01:22:25,020 --> 01:22:27,219
- The three consecutive slots. - Ji Hyo.

2379
01:22:27,220 --> 01:22:28,875
Ji Hyo, Ji Hyo. Will it go past this slot?

2380
01:22:29,130 --> 01:22:32,432
(It stops at Song Ji Hyo.)

2381
01:22:32,600 --> 01:22:34,548
Ji Hyo, Ji Hyo. Will it go past this slot?

2382
01:22:35,569 --> 01:22:38,299
(Team Ace wins.)

2383
01:22:38,300 --> 01:22:39,438
She is incredible.

2384
01:22:39,439 --> 01:22:40,698
(Ji Hyo always wins.)

2385
01:22:40,699 --> 01:22:42,009
She is incredible.

2386
01:22:42,010 --> 01:22:43,928
- Ji Hyo. - What is your deal?

2387
01:22:44,369 --> 01:22:46,663
I will sleep in LA!

2388
01:22:47,539 --> 01:22:49,578
(Ji Hyo is at the level to go to LA to sleep.)

2389
01:22:49,579 --> 01:22:51,709
- Ji Hyo is amazing. - Will you go there to sleep?

2390
01:22:51,710 --> 01:22:52,948
(I give honor to my team.)

2391
01:22:52,949 --> 01:22:54,078
This is incredible.

2392
01:22:54,079 --> 01:22:55,648
The Champion lost to Ace.

2393
01:22:55,649 --> 01:22:57,089
Ace is the best.

2394
01:22:57,090 --> 01:22:58,089
- She is the best at roulette. - You can't win...

2395
01:22:58,090 --> 01:23:00,559
- against Ace. - Ace is the best.

2396
01:23:00,560 --> 01:23:01,903
You are so lucky, Ji Hyo.

2397
01:23:02,090 --> 01:23:04,351
I was hoping that Jong Kook would go on a trip.

2398
01:23:05,130 --> 01:23:07,429
The roulette chose her.

2399
01:23:07,430 --> 01:23:09,599
The true ace, Song Ji Hyo!

2400
01:23:09,600 --> 01:23:10,929
(The true ace, Song Ji Hyo)

2401
01:23:10,930 --> 01:23:13,324
- I want her luck. - Seriously.

2402
01:23:14,140 --> 01:23:15,150
She is incredible.
