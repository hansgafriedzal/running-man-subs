1
00:00:06,340 --> 00:00:08,008
- Hello. - Hi.

2
00:00:08,009 --> 00:00:09,406
- Hello. - Hi.

3
00:00:09,439 --> 00:00:11,276
- Hi. - Hi.

4
00:00:11,580 --> 00:00:13,279
(Feeling fresh for the spring)

5
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:16,848
I asked you to put on a freshman's outfit.

6
00:00:16,849 --> 00:00:18,349
- Yes. - Do you feel like freshmen?

7
00:00:18,550 --> 00:00:19,948
- Not that much. - Well...

8
00:00:19,949 --> 00:00:21,245
- It's... - What's up with Haha?

9
00:00:21,789 --> 00:00:24,288
- I... - Isn't that for a night guest?

10
00:00:24,289 --> 00:00:25,319
(Looking dark)

11
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:27,488
- Isn't he a returning student? - Our outfits are so different.

12
00:00:27,489 --> 00:00:29,947
I think my stylist put some effort into this.

13
00:00:31,100 --> 00:00:33,344
You dressed like an IT specialist.

14
00:00:33,899 --> 00:00:35,628
- At the Electronics Market... - By the way,

15
00:00:35,629 --> 00:00:38,394
Seok Jin doesn't look like a freshman though.

16
00:00:38,799 --> 00:00:40,108
Why not? This is how they dress.

17
00:00:40,109 --> 00:00:41,169
- What? - He just put on whatever was there.

18
00:00:41,170 --> 00:00:42,508
This checkered pattern is a given.

19
00:00:42,509 --> 00:00:43,639
- You just look like... - Freshmen wear checkered shirts.

20
00:00:43,640 --> 00:00:45,108
an old man who can't dress well.

21
00:00:45,109 --> 00:00:48,249
(You just look like an old man who can't dress well.)

22
00:00:48,250 --> 00:00:50,618
- Hey, you. - But you are indeed my role model.

23
00:00:50,619 --> 00:00:52,864
- The role model of the year. - Look who's talking.

24
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:54,819
By the way, everyone's outfit is awful.

25
00:00:54,820 --> 00:00:56,158
- So Min looks like a freshman. - The jacket from the department.

26
00:00:56,159 --> 00:00:58,059
- She looks like a college student. - She looks like a freshman.

27
00:00:58,060 --> 00:01:00,389
(The jacket from the department completes the freshman outfit.)

28
00:01:00,390 --> 00:01:02,806
In my opinion, So Min's fashion is that of...

29
00:01:03,030 --> 00:01:06,293
a clueless senior student who tagged along to the orientation.

30
00:01:06,700 --> 00:01:08,433
Just that thought is suffocating.

31
00:01:08,929 --> 00:01:11,268
- She thought about the old times. - Yes, she looks like a senior.

32
00:01:11,269 --> 00:01:12,399
- She wanted to look young. - Right.

33
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:13,460
- She works at a company now. - The department jacket...

34
00:01:13,510 --> 00:01:15,839
She came here on her weekend.

35
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:17,471
- Manager Jeon. - She took a half-day off.

36
00:01:17,579 --> 00:01:19,345
- She's Manager Jeon. - She took a half-day off...

37
00:01:19,450 --> 00:01:20,809
and came to the orientation.

38
00:01:20,810 --> 00:01:23,649
And he became a successful thug.

39
00:01:23,650 --> 00:01:25,249
(He made it in the dark world early in his age.)

40
00:01:25,250 --> 00:01:27,698
(The big brother of the dark world, Kook)

41
00:01:28,120 --> 00:01:30,919
- Right. - There are people like him.

42
00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:32,718
- That's right. - This kind of people does exist.

43
00:01:32,719 --> 00:01:35,029
There's a major for Physical Fitness.

44
00:01:35,030 --> 00:01:37,375
- Physical Fitness? - I chose Physical Fitness.

45
00:01:37,629 --> 00:01:39,968
He opened up a billiard club in front of college.

46
00:01:39,969 --> 00:01:41,969
- Billiard club? Okay, okay. - He's a successful owner.

47
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,794
- He opened a billiard club. - A billiard club.

48
00:01:44,799 --> 00:01:47,968
We plan to hold an orientation for the freshmen...

49
00:01:47,969 --> 00:01:50,208
- to celebrate the spring. - Orientation.

50
00:01:50,209 --> 00:01:53,149
- That sounds fun. - It's the orientation.

51
00:01:53,150 --> 00:01:54,848
- I've never been to one. - Really?

52
00:01:54,849 --> 00:01:56,779
- No, never. - We will start...

53
00:01:56,780 --> 00:01:58,044
the orientation right away.

54
00:01:58,180 --> 00:01:59,889
Please take a look at your schedule today.

55
00:01:59,890 --> 00:02:01,289
- There's a schedule? - Please hold your orientation...

56
00:02:01,290 --> 00:02:02,789
- according to the schedule. - We're starting.

57
00:02:02,790 --> 00:02:04,358
That's the schedule for the orientation.

58
00:02:04,359 --> 00:02:06,729
We took this schedule from a real orientation of a college.

59
00:02:06,730 --> 00:02:07,811
- Really? - Yes.

60
00:02:08,090 --> 00:02:09,999
- This is the recent one. - "Lunch".

61
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,098
- "Lunch". - I'm looking forward to it.

62
00:02:11,099 --> 00:02:12,763
- "Introduction". - "Recreational activities".

63
00:02:12,930 --> 00:02:14,968
We are all freshmen today.

64
00:02:14,969 --> 00:02:17,598
Kwang Soo, you entered college in 2019.

65
00:02:17,599 --> 00:02:19,608
- Yes. - Please introduce yourself.

66
00:02:19,810 --> 00:02:20,839
Hello, guys.

67
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:22,440
(Nice to meet you.)

68
00:02:22,770 --> 00:02:23,908
Don't be so casual.

69
00:02:23,909 --> 00:02:25,339
(I had to take the college entrance exam again.)

70
00:02:25,340 --> 00:02:26,635
Right. How old are you?

71
00:02:26,810 --> 00:02:29,348
- We just started our school year. - We don't know each other.

72
00:02:29,349 --> 00:02:30,818
- Some are older than us. - Everyone here had their fun.

73
00:02:30,819 --> 00:02:32,961
I just said one line. "Hello, guys."

74
00:02:33,789 --> 00:02:35,489
- How could you... - You should realize...

75
00:02:35,490 --> 00:02:37,288
- you shouldn't call them "guys". - Okay, okay.

76
00:02:37,289 --> 00:02:38,585
- Okay. - All right.

77
00:02:38,620 --> 00:02:39,788
- Hello, everyone. - Okay.

78
00:02:39,789 --> 00:02:41,529
I'm Lee Kwang Soo. I'm a freshman.

79
00:02:41,530 --> 00:02:42,611
You sound so weak.

80
00:02:43,830 --> 00:02:47,568
Let's pour some oil onto one spoonful of your passion.

81
00:02:47,569 --> 00:02:48,869
(Complaining about his passion)

82
00:02:48,870 --> 00:02:50,299
(Chanting a slogan)

83
00:02:50,300 --> 00:02:53,269
(Hello, everyone.)

84
00:02:53,270 --> 00:02:54,309
Hello, everyone.

85
00:02:54,310 --> 00:02:56,638
(He came for an orientation, but he sounds like he's enlisting.)

86
00:02:56,639 --> 00:02:58,374
I entered college in 2019. My name is Lee Kwang Soo.

87
00:02:58,879 --> 00:03:02,175
As I'm shy, I didn't have a chance to talk in front of a group.

88
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:03,848
He said he's shy.

89
00:03:03,849 --> 00:03:05,074
(Laughing)

90
00:03:05,349 --> 00:03:06,718
My goal for this year is...

91
00:03:06,719 --> 00:03:09,318
Face forward and scream for three seconds.

92
00:03:09,319 --> 00:03:10,585
What is this place?

93
00:03:10,759 --> 00:03:12,627
(Screaming)

94
00:03:12,789 --> 00:03:13,953
Are we in the army or what?

95
00:03:14,789 --> 00:03:17,350
Seriously. I could hear the echo.

96
00:03:17,599 --> 00:03:19,899
Okay. I got it. Let's give it up for him.

97
00:03:19,900 --> 00:03:20,920
I hope we get along.

98
00:03:21,500 --> 00:03:23,336
- Why don't you introduce yourself? - Se Chan.

99
00:03:23,340 --> 00:03:24,391
Out of my way.

100
00:03:24,439 --> 00:03:28,008
Hello. I'm a freshman who entered college in 2019.

101
00:03:28,009 --> 00:03:29,132
What's up with his face?

102
00:03:29,810 --> 00:03:30,962
I'm Yang Se Chan.

103
00:03:31,009 --> 00:03:32,609
- He's so ugly. - I'm Yang Se Chan.

104
00:03:32,610 --> 00:03:33,649
- He's really a freshman? - He's really a freshman?

105
00:03:33,650 --> 00:03:36,718
Actually, I've never been to an orientation. It's my first one.

106
00:03:36,719 --> 00:03:38,249
Show me your special talent.

107
00:03:38,250 --> 00:03:39,788
- Can you show us a special talent. - Show us your special talent.

108
00:03:39,789 --> 00:03:41,348
Special talent? Okay.

109
00:03:41,349 --> 00:03:42,788
I do this a lot on "Comedy Big League".

110
00:03:42,789 --> 00:03:44,359
- Yes, do one for us. - I love that show.

111
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:45,359
- Okay. - What is it?

112
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:47,329
- Do you know this guy named Greg? - Yes.

113
00:03:47,330 --> 00:03:49,758
- This black guy sings soulfully. - Is that so?

114
00:03:49,759 --> 00:03:51,228
(This is the black soul of Greg.)

115
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:55,799
(Greg can express Korean rhythm and blues better than Koreans.)

116
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:57,568
(Because I love you)

117
00:03:57,569 --> 00:04:00,598
(Skipping a beat)

118
00:04:01,110 --> 00:04:04,079
(Singing the song a beat later with vibrato is the key point.)

119
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:05,978
- This black guy sings soulfully. - Is that so?

120
00:04:05,979 --> 00:04:08,008
I will impersonate him and sing "I Miss You".

121
00:04:08,009 --> 00:04:10,519
- I know him. I know Greg. - Do that for us. I know Greg.

122
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:12,111
- I know Greg. - He's a great singer.

123
00:04:12,180 --> 00:04:13,288
He's a great singer.

124
00:04:13,289 --> 00:04:17,298
(The memories of my deep love for you)

125
00:04:17,659 --> 00:04:19,220
(And those days)

126
00:04:20,189 --> 00:04:22,882
(The skipping-the-beat method makes him sound like Greg.)

127
00:04:23,430 --> 00:04:24,429
He's good.

128
00:04:24,430 --> 00:04:27,198
(I can't use my love as an excuse)

129
00:04:27,199 --> 00:04:28,352
(to hold you here)

130
00:04:30,839 --> 00:04:33,809
(The female students find his singing...)

131
00:04:33,810 --> 00:04:35,503
(hilarious.)

132
00:04:35,769 --> 00:04:37,208
Hold you here

133
00:04:37,209 --> 00:04:38,979
(He's killing it at the orientation.)

134
00:04:38,980 --> 00:04:40,249
- That's Greg. - Good job.

135
00:04:40,250 --> 00:04:42,749
- I love this kind of acts. - This is my impersonation of him.

136
00:04:42,750 --> 00:04:44,892
- Okay, great. Go back to your spot. - Okay.

137
00:04:45,050 --> 00:04:46,388
- Welcome. - Thank you.

138
00:04:46,389 --> 00:04:48,287
- That's totally my kind of act. - That was great.

139
00:04:48,649 --> 00:04:49,842
Hey, friend.

140
00:04:51,060 --> 00:04:54,088
I learned that I'm supposed to do this at orientation.

141
00:04:54,089 --> 00:04:55,088
Do what?

142
00:04:55,089 --> 00:04:56,324
I'll start now!

143
00:04:56,399 --> 00:04:59,099
Democracy to Running Man! Entertainment on TV!

144
00:04:59,100 --> 00:05:01,698
(This is an outdated method of introduction.)

145
00:05:01,699 --> 00:05:03,398
- What is she doing? - I'm a future star!

146
00:05:03,399 --> 00:05:04,599
20191756.

147
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:06,409
- Hold on. Wait. - I'm Jeon So Min.

148
00:05:06,410 --> 00:05:08,438
- This isn't going to air. - Accept my energetic greetings!

149
00:05:08,439 --> 00:05:09,469
- What are you doing? - Hey.

150
00:05:09,470 --> 00:05:10,907
Show me your acceptance letter.

151
00:05:11,079 --> 00:05:12,479
- What? - You didn't get accepted, right?

152
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:13,633
I did get accepted.

153
00:05:13,850 --> 00:05:15,339
- Stop lying! - Do your introduction again.

154
00:05:16,279 --> 00:05:17,749
Okay, then. Hello, guys.

155
00:05:17,750 --> 00:05:19,349
(Sounding like a freshman)

156
00:05:19,350 --> 00:05:21,489
I entered college this year. I'm Jeon So Min.

157
00:05:21,490 --> 00:05:23,498
I really want to go on a lot of group dates.

158
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:26,729
- Do you have a boyfriend? - No, I don't.

159
00:05:26,730 --> 00:05:27,750
She's a bit over-the-top.

160
00:05:28,430 --> 00:05:30,528
- She really wants blind dates. - Where did you go to school?

161
00:05:30,529 --> 00:05:31,599
She's too much.

162
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:33,469
- Why would she say that now? - Exactly.

163
00:05:33,470 --> 00:05:36,328
Ever since I was in high school,

164
00:05:36,329 --> 00:05:38,198
I wanted to date a student in the upper grade.

165
00:05:38,199 --> 00:05:39,369
Dating someone from my school is my dream.

166
00:05:39,370 --> 00:05:40,532
That means it's Seok Jin.

167
00:05:41,370 --> 00:05:43,179
- What do you think about me? - No.

168
00:05:43,180 --> 00:05:45,455
I don't want a returning student. I want a student in an upper grade.

169
00:05:45,540 --> 00:05:46,549
- I want a senior student. - What?

170
00:05:46,550 --> 00:05:49,058
- A student in a grade above mine. - I'm not a returning student.

171
00:05:49,079 --> 00:05:50,854
Do you think he'd keep coming back for 20 years?

172
00:05:51,980 --> 00:05:54,570
- What are you talking about? - I'm not a returning student.

173
00:05:54,819 --> 00:05:56,492
This is like "Whispering Corridors".

174
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:59,929
Anyway, like your dream, I wish you'd meet someone great.

175
00:05:59,930 --> 00:06:00,989
- Thank you. - Okay.

176
00:06:00,990 --> 00:06:01,989
(Date someone from the school.)

177
00:06:01,990 --> 00:06:03,599
- You're next. - Okay.

178
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:05,059
(The big brother of the dark world is next.)

179
00:06:05,060 --> 00:06:06,099
Guys.

180
00:06:06,100 --> 00:06:08,299
(Exuding a dark presence)

181
00:06:08,300 --> 00:06:09,999
- I can tell he'll be the boss. - He's scary.

182
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:10,999
He'll be the boss.

183
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,898
This is what I can do for you guys.

184
00:06:12,899 --> 00:06:15,215
If students from another school come at us,

185
00:06:15,509 --> 00:06:17,278
- I can stop them. - I feel so reassured.

186
00:06:17,279 --> 00:06:19,378
- Why would college students... - We're in college.

187
00:06:19,379 --> 00:06:20,479
- have group fights? - We don't do that here.

188
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:21,939
Really? College students don't fight?

189
00:06:22,610 --> 00:06:23,619
- We don't fight. - Listen.

190
00:06:23,620 --> 00:06:26,027
- It happened in my high school. - That doesn't happen at college.

191
00:06:26,050 --> 00:06:27,188
- There are no group fights... - People don't fight at college?

192
00:06:27,189 --> 00:06:28,984
- at college. - Why did he kill the mood?

193
00:06:29,149 --> 00:06:30,517
What? What did you say?

194
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:32,289
I wasn't talking to you, sir.

195
00:06:32,290 --> 00:06:34,888
(Acting scared)

196
00:06:34,889 --> 00:06:36,188
- He's in our grade. - He's in the same grade.

197
00:06:36,189 --> 00:06:37,898
- Why did you talk to him like that? - Hey, he's in the same grade.

198
00:06:37,899 --> 00:06:39,328
- We're the same age too? - Anyway,

199
00:06:39,329 --> 00:06:41,207
I'm good-natured.

200
00:06:41,430 --> 00:06:42,695
I'm cheerful too.

201
00:06:43,029 --> 00:06:44,039
Let's get along well.

202
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:45,732
Anyway, let's give it up for him.

203
00:06:46,509 --> 00:06:48,275
- Welcome. - Come back to your spot.

204
00:06:49,170 --> 00:06:51,077
He's next. Here he is.

205
00:06:51,379 --> 00:06:52,431
- All right. - Okay.

206
00:06:52,939 --> 00:06:53,969
Everyone.

207
00:06:54,810 --> 00:06:57,948
- You all think I'm old. - Yes.

208
00:06:57,949 --> 00:07:00,088
But I was born in the early year of 1999.

209
00:07:00,089 --> 00:07:01,749
(He makes a shocking statement.)

210
00:07:01,750 --> 00:07:02,872
- What? - That's why...

211
00:07:03,050 --> 00:07:04,419
Do you mean, 1899?

212
00:07:04,420 --> 00:07:05,989
(I get it!)

213
00:07:05,990 --> 00:07:07,588
Doesn't that mean he's a mummy?

214
00:07:07,589 --> 00:07:09,429
(This mysterious student, Seok Jin, has been showing for 121 years.)

215
00:07:09,430 --> 00:07:11,776
- 1999? - 1899.

216
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:13,369
It's 1999.

217
00:07:13,370 --> 00:07:14,398
(He turns out to be a dinosaur student.)

218
00:07:14,399 --> 00:07:15,729
It's 1999.

219
00:07:15,730 --> 00:07:18,758
- He looks young if it's 1899. - He does look young.

220
00:07:18,970 --> 00:07:21,239
(He looks like a 54-year-old guy.)

221
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:23,525
- Goodness. It's hilarious. - It's so funny.

222
00:07:23,709 --> 00:07:25,638
- Why don't you go next, Ji Hyo? - It's so funny.

223
00:07:25,639 --> 00:07:26,778
Do a brief introduction.

224
00:07:26,779 --> 00:07:28,148
- She's pretty. - She is indeed.

225
00:07:28,149 --> 00:07:29,230
She's pretty.

226
00:07:29,949 --> 00:07:31,448
Hello.

227
00:07:31,449 --> 00:07:34,785
My name is Song Ji Hyo. I entered college this year.

228
00:07:35,519 --> 00:07:36,888
She put on makeup.

229
00:07:36,889 --> 00:07:37,888
(She catches their attention.)

230
00:07:37,889 --> 00:07:40,848
I wanted to look pretty today. I even got a haircut.

231
00:07:41,189 --> 00:07:43,168
Ji Hyo, you look very tired today.

232
00:07:43,759 --> 00:07:45,392
Yes, I'm tired.

233
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:47,232
I think I've been standing up for too long.

234
00:07:47,269 --> 00:07:48,268
- Is that so? - Yes.

235
00:07:48,269 --> 00:07:50,922
Which introduction tired you out the most?

236
00:07:51,939 --> 00:07:53,409
The one before mine.

237
00:07:53,410 --> 00:07:56,679
(It's the one before hers. It means it's Seok Jin's.)

238
00:07:56,680 --> 00:07:57,833
I was really shocked.

239
00:07:58,009 --> 00:07:59,203
Do you have a boyfriend?

240
00:07:59,639 --> 00:08:01,108
I don't have a boyfriend now.

241
00:08:01,550 --> 00:08:02,578
I thought so.

242
00:08:02,579 --> 00:08:04,078
(A mean remark of a 54-year-old guy)

243
00:08:04,079 --> 00:08:06,278
(My gosh...)

244
00:08:06,279 --> 00:08:07,310
Seriously.

245
00:08:07,750 --> 00:08:08,811
Let's give it up for her.

246
00:08:09,620 --> 00:08:10,640
Thank you.

247
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:12,359
- She's pretty. - Great.

248
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:13,584
- She's pretty. - Next.

249
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:17,099
(Here comes the hipster of Running University.)

250
00:08:17,100 --> 00:08:18,120
- He already looks pretentious. - My gosh.

251
00:08:18,459 --> 00:08:20,028
- He already looks pretentious. - His outfit...

252
00:08:20,029 --> 00:08:22,198
(Fixing his front hair to intensify his hipster sentiment)

253
00:08:22,199 --> 00:08:23,239
He's acting pretentious.

254
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:27,338
(This is the comment of his impression.)

255
00:08:27,339 --> 00:08:29,138
(Sighing)

256
00:08:29,139 --> 00:08:30,278
(I didn't mean to say it out loud.)

257
00:08:30,279 --> 00:08:32,453
- What's up with your hair? - I'm sorry.

258
00:08:32,980 --> 00:08:34,809
Let's not get on each other's bad side.

259
00:08:34,810 --> 00:08:36,033
(Acting like a jerk for the 2nd time)

260
00:08:36,550 --> 00:08:37,549
Unbelievable.

261
00:08:37,550 --> 00:08:39,722
- Should I handle him? - That little jerk.

262
00:08:40,049 --> 00:08:41,148
- My gosh, that guy. - Hey.

263
00:08:41,149 --> 00:08:42,489
You should take care of him. I can't stand him.

264
00:08:42,490 --> 00:08:44,765
Anyway, let's not get on each other's bad side.

265
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:45,989
Let's get along well.

266
00:08:45,990 --> 00:08:47,284
Why don't you rap for us?

267
00:08:47,759 --> 00:08:48,788
Sure.

268
00:08:48,789 --> 00:08:52,604
(Responding to it right away)

269
00:08:53,230 --> 00:08:54,903
- That was good. - Is that a freestyle rap?

270
00:08:55,070 --> 00:08:56,428
- Give him a theme. - He's pretty good.

271
00:08:56,429 --> 00:08:57,439
- Rap for us. - Okay.

272
00:08:57,440 --> 00:08:58,668
Nothing ever stops me.

273
00:08:58,669 --> 00:09:00,751
- My gosh, he's good. - Okay, then.

274
00:09:01,070 --> 00:09:02,191
Give me a theme.

275
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:03,739
- Orientation. - Orientation.

276
00:09:03,740 --> 00:09:07,115
(The theme of the freestyle rap is the orientation.)

277
00:09:07,250 --> 00:09:08,330
OT

278
00:09:09,649 --> 00:09:10,669
Your face

279
00:09:10,820 --> 00:09:11,918
A fly in the ointment

280
00:09:11,919 --> 00:09:15,622
(Your face, a fly in the ointment)

281
00:09:18,220 --> 00:09:19,963
- Is this it? - That looks so cheap.

282
00:09:20,429 --> 00:09:21,511
I won.

283
00:09:22,059 --> 00:09:23,213
What did he win?

284
00:09:23,629 --> 00:09:24,924
- What did he win? - OT.

285
00:09:25,899 --> 00:09:27,528
- Come back in. Clap for him. - Thank you.

286
00:09:27,529 --> 00:09:28,999
- Your hair is great. - Welcome.

287
00:09:29,330 --> 00:09:30,930
- Welcome. - He's unique.

288
00:09:31,039 --> 00:09:32,599
- He's not like the others. - You're so cool.

289
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:33,638
- His hair is cool. - Welcome.

290
00:09:33,639 --> 00:09:36,469
- I have a list of new freshmen. - There's more?

291
00:09:36,470 --> 00:09:37,479
We have more freshmen.

292
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:38,530
- Goodness. - Gosh.

293
00:09:38,580 --> 00:09:40,588
- Other students are joining us. - What is this?

294
00:09:40,710 --> 00:09:42,678
- We have more freshmen. - We do?

295
00:09:42,679 --> 00:09:43,699
All right.

296
00:09:44,279 --> 00:09:45,341
This student.

297
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:48,640
This student used to be in a group.

298
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:50,518
(If the student used to be in a group...)

299
00:09:50,519 --> 00:09:52,189
Does that mean the student is a singer?

300
00:09:52,190 --> 00:09:54,230
- This student used to be a member. - Is it an idol singer?

301
00:09:54,860 --> 00:09:57,058
(Who is this mysterious freshman?)

302
00:09:57,059 --> 00:09:58,058
Hey!

303
00:09:58,059 --> 00:09:59,936
She made her debut 13 years ago. It's Hong Jin Young.

304
00:10:00,700 --> 00:10:01,853
- It's Jin Young. - Jin Young.

305
00:10:03,340 --> 00:10:07,638
(Welcome back to Running Man. She's the 9th member of the show.)

306
00:10:07,639 --> 00:10:10,434
(This passionate freshman comes with a thumbs-up.)

307
00:10:10,580 --> 00:10:13,479
Hello, I entered college this year. I'm Jin Young. I major in trot.

308
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:14,877
- You're majoring in trot. - Nice to meet you.

309
00:10:15,350 --> 00:10:16,819
She only looked at the camera, not us.

310
00:10:16,820 --> 00:10:18,849
- You're majoring in trot. - Yes.

311
00:10:18,850 --> 00:10:21,298
I want to be a singer...

312
00:10:21,590 --> 00:10:23,249
this year,

313
00:10:23,250 --> 00:10:25,564
and my first full-length album happen to come out this year.

314
00:10:26,090 --> 00:10:27,928
- Your full-length album? - Yes.

315
00:10:27,929 --> 00:10:29,658
This is your first full-length album.

316
00:10:29,659 --> 00:10:31,199
- This is your 1st? - Yes, it's my 1st one.

317
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:32,829
- You made your debut a long ago. - Then...

318
00:10:32,830 --> 00:10:34,928
Then will your 2nd full-length album come out after 10 years?

319
00:10:34,929 --> 00:10:36,199
(It took 13 years for the 1st one to come out.)

320
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:37,439
I didn't know it either.

321
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:38,999
- That's impressive. - This is my first one.

322
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,168
- You only released singles then. - Yes.

323
00:10:40,169 --> 00:10:41,209
By the way,

324
00:10:41,210 --> 00:10:42,969
I saw her for the first time...

325
00:10:42,970 --> 00:10:44,203
in a show called "Cider".

326
00:10:44,509 --> 00:10:46,949
It's not airing anymore. It was a KBS program.

327
00:10:46,950 --> 00:10:48,148
- That's right. - She acted on the show.

328
00:10:48,149 --> 00:10:49,178
- She acted on the show. - For the skits?

329
00:10:49,179 --> 00:10:52,119
I remember thinking that she was really good at acting then.

330
00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:54,129
- You did a great job with it. - Thank you.

331
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:56,489
I was Anna in "Anna's Mistake".

332
00:10:56,490 --> 00:10:57,558
- "Anna's Mistake" . - Yes.

333
00:10:57,559 --> 00:10:59,489
- "Anna's Mistake"? - You were Anna?

334
00:10:59,490 --> 00:11:00,489
- Really? - She was Anna.

335
00:11:00,490 --> 00:11:02,628
- I know the show. - You do? You know me?

336
00:11:02,629 --> 00:11:03,798
- "Anna's Mistake". - You were Anna?

337
00:11:03,799 --> 00:11:05,128
- Jin Young was Anna. - Really?

338
00:11:05,129 --> 00:11:08,398
My face did change slightly compared to before.

339
00:11:08,399 --> 00:11:09,522
- Right? - Yes.

340
00:11:09,570 --> 00:11:11,069
- No, no. - I am that Anna.

341
00:11:11,070 --> 00:11:12,599
- I know that show. - That's right.

342
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:13,739
Since we talked a lot about this,

343
00:11:13,740 --> 00:11:14,995
they'll definitely air the footage.

344
00:11:15,169 --> 00:11:16,189
They'll air the footage.

345
00:11:16,610 --> 00:11:18,178
By the way, Anna...

346
00:11:18,179 --> 00:11:19,308
(We will summon...)

347
00:11:19,309 --> 00:11:22,573
(Anna we liked back in the days.)

348
00:11:23,679 --> 00:11:25,516
- Anna, what are you doing? - I'm curious.

349
00:11:26,080 --> 00:11:27,446
Mr. Heat.

350
00:11:27,690 --> 00:11:29,076
I'm "kimming" up.

351
00:11:30,190 --> 00:11:33,258
(Anna with off-the-wall charms was Jin Young from her early days.)

352
00:11:33,259 --> 00:11:35,658
- I found out that it was Jin Young. - Right.

353
00:11:35,659 --> 00:11:37,199
All right. Jin Young is joining us today.

354
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:38,829
Okay. She's majoring in trot.

355
00:11:38,830 --> 00:11:40,229
I'll bring in the next student.

356
00:11:40,230 --> 00:11:41,768
I'll tell you after I bring the student in.

357
00:11:41,769 --> 00:11:42,789
All right. Come on out.

358
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,768
(This mysterious freshman is joining them late.)

359
00:11:45,769 --> 00:11:48,319
(Who is this student?)

360
00:11:49,009 --> 00:11:50,709
(The rookie of the film industry, Keum Sae Rok)

361
00:11:50,710 --> 00:11:52,208
- Keum Sae Rok. - Keum Sae Rok.

362
00:11:52,740 --> 00:11:54,687
Can I introduce myself a bit more?

363
00:11:54,879 --> 00:11:56,032
You don't need to...

364
00:11:56,080 --> 00:11:58,678
(Rapping)

365
00:11:58,679 --> 00:12:02,388
(This pretty actress has an unusual and unexpected swag.)

366
00:12:02,389 --> 00:12:04,558
(She was in "Believer" and "The Fiery Priest".)

367
00:12:04,559 --> 00:12:06,788
(She's a rising star the film industry is keeping its eyes on.)

368
00:12:06,789 --> 00:12:08,058
Hello.

369
00:12:08,059 --> 00:12:10,459
I'm a fresh newbie of Running Man. I'm Keum Sae Rok.

370
00:12:10,460 --> 00:12:13,590
(I'm a fresh newbie of Running Man. I'm Keum Sae Rok.)

371
00:12:14,700 --> 00:12:15,821
- A fresh newbie. - A fresh newbie.

372
00:12:16,940 --> 00:12:17,939
She's so fresh.

373
00:12:17,940 --> 00:12:19,599
She's like a real freshman.

374
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:21,099
- She's a real freshman. - I can feel that vibe from her.

375
00:12:21,139 --> 00:12:23,408
- She's elegant too. - This is her first time here.

376
00:12:23,409 --> 00:12:25,278
- In that sense, she's a freshman. - That's right.

377
00:12:25,279 --> 00:12:26,378
(Freshman of Running Man, Sae Rok.)

378
00:12:26,379 --> 00:12:28,247
I'll have fun today.

379
00:12:28,710 --> 00:12:30,119
- No, you must entertain us. - Okay.

380
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:33,349
(He corrects her mindset.)

381
00:12:33,350 --> 00:12:34,589
- You're so cold-hearted. - My goodness.

382
00:12:34,590 --> 00:12:35,749
- The leader is honest. - That was too mean.

383
00:12:35,750 --> 00:12:37,189
- Our leader is honest. - What's wrong with you?

384
00:12:37,190 --> 00:12:39,459
It's important that you have fun today, but you must...

385
00:12:39,460 --> 00:12:40,758
- entertain the viewers too. - That's right.

386
00:12:40,759 --> 00:12:42,259
- That's our request. - Okay.

387
00:12:42,389 --> 00:12:43,827
Is there a variety show you like?

388
00:12:43,960 --> 00:12:45,968
- Running Man. - Except for our program.

389
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,128
- Haha and I... - Okay.

390
00:12:48,129 --> 00:12:49,599
live in the same neighborhood.

391
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:51,869
- I'm also the guardian... - Do you live in Mapo-gu.

392
00:12:51,870 --> 00:12:53,038
- of Mapo-gu. - I'm the sheriff of Mapo-gu.

393
00:12:53,039 --> 00:12:54,439
- Are you the guardian? - Bang, bang, bang.

394
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:55,969
- Bang. - I'm also the sheriff.

395
00:12:55,970 --> 00:12:57,808
- You're the sheriff too. - Yes.

396
00:12:57,809 --> 00:13:00,008
- She lives in Mapo-gu too. - I live in Mapo-gu too.

397
00:13:00,009 --> 00:13:01,132
She's the guardian of Mapo-gu.

398
00:13:01,710 --> 00:13:02,709
(Sae Rok is the guardian of Mapo-gu.)

399
00:13:02,710 --> 00:13:04,819
- He's the sheriff of Mapo-gu. - I'm the sheriff.

400
00:13:04,820 --> 00:13:05,878
What about you?

401
00:13:05,879 --> 00:13:07,522
- She just lives there. - I live in Mapo-gu.

402
00:13:07,750 --> 00:13:08,788
- I see. - She's a civilian.

403
00:13:08,789 --> 00:13:10,018
I just live in Mapo-gu.

404
00:13:10,019 --> 00:13:11,219
- I see. - She's a civilian.

405
00:13:11,220 --> 00:13:13,158
- Ji Hyo lives in Mapo-gu. - She is the resident there.

406
00:13:13,389 --> 00:13:14,558
She's a resident.

407
00:13:14,559 --> 00:13:15,558
- Great. - I didn't know.

408
00:13:15,559 --> 00:13:18,456
I will bring in the last freshman after Sae Rok.

409
00:13:18,700 --> 00:13:19,798
Let me tell you about this student.

410
00:13:19,799 --> 00:13:21,534
We're very familiar with this student,

411
00:13:21,570 --> 00:13:23,969
but I bet you've never heard of the name.

412
00:13:23,970 --> 00:13:25,099
- Who is it? - All right.

413
00:13:25,100 --> 00:13:26,339
- This student... - We might not recognize the name?

414
00:13:26,340 --> 00:13:28,482
- We've never heard of the name? - Just like the name...

415
00:13:29,669 --> 00:13:32,939
(Who is this mysterious freshman that puzzles the members?)

416
00:13:32,940 --> 00:13:34,008
(The first queen of Drama Department)

417
00:13:34,009 --> 00:13:36,449
My goodness, my goodness.

418
00:13:36,450 --> 00:13:37,619
Hello.

419
00:13:37,620 --> 00:13:41,567
(She's a pretty and tall actress that never fails the viewers.)

420
00:13:43,049 --> 00:13:46,489
(It turns out she's a dancing queen.)

421
00:13:46,490 --> 00:13:48,528
(The queen of excitement)

422
00:13:48,529 --> 00:13:49,589
- My goodness. - Hello.

423
00:13:49,590 --> 00:13:50,628
My goodness.

424
00:13:50,629 --> 00:13:51,649
(The actress who knows how to have fun is back.)

425
00:13:52,100 --> 00:13:53,660
- Hello. - My gosh.

426
00:13:53,929 --> 00:13:55,663
- My gosh. - We'll have so much fun today!

427
00:13:56,129 --> 00:13:58,268
- It will be fun today. - And...

428
00:13:58,269 --> 00:13:59,499
(They are excited.)

429
00:13:59,500 --> 00:14:00,794
- Right. - I'm not sure if you know this.

430
00:14:01,070 --> 00:14:02,969
She changed her name to Han Da Gam.

431
00:14:02,970 --> 00:14:04,378
- Really? - She changed her name.

432
00:14:04,379 --> 00:14:05,378
(She changed her name to Han Da Gam.)

433
00:14:05,379 --> 00:14:06,378
She changed her name.

434
00:14:06,379 --> 00:14:08,548
- It's Han Da Gam. - I saw that trending up online.

435
00:14:08,549 --> 00:14:10,386
- I wanted to... - Okay.

436
00:14:10,950 --> 00:14:14,449
approach the public in a more friendly and affectionate manner.

437
00:14:14,450 --> 00:14:15,548
I'm trying my best.

438
00:14:15,549 --> 00:14:19,518
(She maximizes her friendliness.)

439
00:14:19,519 --> 00:14:21,264
She's scarier now. She's scarier.

440
00:14:21,289 --> 00:14:22,729
- She's a new person. She's scary. - She's weird.

441
00:14:22,730 --> 00:14:23,928
She's gotten weird.

442
00:14:23,929 --> 00:14:25,358
Excuse me. We can feel...

443
00:14:25,399 --> 00:14:27,528
that you're trying hard, so it makes us uncomfortable.

444
00:14:27,529 --> 00:14:28,798
Hello, guys.

445
00:14:28,799 --> 00:14:30,668
(Stubbornly acting friendly)

446
00:14:30,669 --> 00:14:32,739
- What's up with her hand gesture? - Don't force it.

447
00:14:32,740 --> 00:14:34,505
- I haven't seen this for a while. - You're making us uncomfortable.

448
00:14:34,840 --> 00:14:36,869
- It was so hard to change my name. - Pardon?

449
00:14:36,870 --> 00:14:38,178
- It was hard to change it. - Then why did you...

450
00:14:38,179 --> 00:14:39,839
- Try to embrace my new name. - But why did you choose...

451
00:14:39,840 --> 00:14:41,079
- Da Gam? - Why did you choose Da Gam?

452
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:42,610
- There are other names too. - There has to be a meaning.

453
00:14:42,950 --> 00:14:45,778
Bok Soon is a friendly name too. That name could've comforted us.

454
00:14:45,779 --> 00:14:47,219
- What did you say? - Bok Soon.

455
00:14:47,220 --> 00:14:48,288
There are names like that.

456
00:14:48,289 --> 00:14:50,319
My aunt's name is Bok Soon.

457
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:52,959
(My aunt's name is Bok Soon.)

458
00:14:52,960 --> 00:14:54,388
Is that so?

459
00:14:54,659 --> 00:14:56,904
- You're scaring me. - Your aunt...

460
00:14:57,529 --> 00:14:58,729
- Really? - Your aunt...

461
00:14:58,730 --> 00:15:00,607
- Da Gam is a great name. - Yes.

462
00:15:00,769 --> 00:15:01,829
- I like the name. - It's a great name.

463
00:15:01,830 --> 00:15:03,398
- The name has a nice ring to it. - People will criticize you a lot.

464
00:15:03,399 --> 00:15:06,069
Kwang Soo, Do you want to have a stage name?

465
00:15:06,070 --> 00:15:07,160
Well...

466
00:15:07,210 --> 00:15:10,069
If I were to, is there a name that suits me?

467
00:15:10,070 --> 00:15:11,100
What do you think, Da Gam?

468
00:15:11,409 --> 00:15:12,736
I used to hate this name when I was young.

469
00:15:12,980 --> 00:15:14,030
- Bo Gae. - How about...

470
00:15:14,309 --> 00:15:15,400
- Lee Bo Gae. - Lee Bo Gae.

471
00:15:15,549 --> 00:15:16,609
- That's... - Bo Gae.

472
00:15:16,610 --> 00:15:17,849
- I wanted a name. - Bo Gae.

473
00:15:17,850 --> 00:15:19,278
(Lee Bo Gae)

474
00:15:19,279 --> 00:15:21,749
(This has to be the friendliest name ever.)

475
00:15:21,750 --> 00:15:22,989
- I wanted a name. - Hey, that's great.

476
00:15:22,990 --> 00:15:24,119
- What a great name. - Lee Bo Gae.

477
00:15:24,120 --> 00:15:25,518
- Lee Bo Gae. - That's great.

478
00:15:25,519 --> 00:15:26,658

- Lee Bo Gae. - Lee Bo Gae.

481
00:15:29,559 --> 00:15:31,229
- Unbelievable. - Bo Gae.

482
00:15:31,230 --> 00:15:33,499
- Lee Bo Gae. - It's a friendly name for everyone.

483
00:15:33,500 --> 00:15:35,947
- Lee Bo Gae. - When you call his name,

484
00:15:35,970 --> 00:15:37,877
you must put your hands behind your back.

485
00:15:37,899 --> 00:15:39,668
- Lee Bo Gae. - Lee Bo Gae.

486
00:15:39,669 --> 00:15:40,869
- You should gather your hands. - Lee Bo Gae.

487
00:15:40,870 --> 00:15:42,109
- Lee Bo Gae. - "Yes."

488
00:15:42,110 --> 00:15:43,739
- This suits him. - Bo Gae is a nice name.

489
00:15:43,740 --> 00:15:45,515
- That name suits you. - Give So Min 50 dollars.

490
00:15:45,840 --> 00:15:48,079
- You really named him. - Right.

491
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:50,497
- Lee Bo Gae is a great name. - Lee Bo Gae.

492
00:15:50,519 --> 00:15:52,548
Since they're joining us today,

493
00:15:52,549 --> 00:15:54,488
just like I mentioned earlier,

494
00:15:54,690 --> 00:15:57,189
- we'll look at their talents. - Yes.

495
00:15:57,190 --> 00:16:00,148
- We showed our talents too. - Right.

496
00:16:00,190 --> 00:16:01,689
What's your special talent?

497
00:16:01,690 --> 00:16:05,096
I can change every song into a trot song.

498
00:16:05,399 --> 00:16:06,699
- That's my special talent. - She's majoring in trot.

499
00:16:06,700 --> 00:16:07,893
- My major is trot. - Is that so?

500
00:16:07,929 --> 00:16:09,168
- Should I sing "Listen"? - "Listen"?

501
00:16:09,169 --> 00:16:10,398
- "Listen". - "Listen".

502
00:16:10,399 --> 00:16:12,174
I love this song by Beyonce.

503
00:16:12,299 --> 00:16:13,319
Listen

504
00:16:13,639 --> 00:16:17,378
(Beyonce's "Listen"...)

505
00:16:17,379 --> 00:16:19,209
(requires the singer to move people and hit the high notes.)

506
00:16:19,210 --> 00:16:21,048
(It's the song with the highest difficulty level.)

507
00:16:21,049 --> 00:16:24,721
(She'll pull off this song after turning it into a trot song?)

508
00:16:25,679 --> 00:16:29,086
(Listen)

509
00:16:29,250 --> 00:16:30,288
That sounds so mellow.

510
00:16:30,289 --> 00:16:31,686
(Mellow)

511
00:16:32,360 --> 00:16:36,847
(Mellow sounds of "Listen" play all over Gapyeong.)

512
00:16:37,330 --> 00:16:40,569
(Can complete)

513
00:16:40,570 --> 00:16:42,668
(She demonstrates her voice vibration.)

514
00:16:42,669 --> 00:16:44,839
(Impressive)

515
00:16:44,840 --> 00:16:46,939
(Her magical singing of turning rhythm and blues to trot music.)

516
00:16:46,940 --> 00:16:48,138
I like this version better.

517
00:16:48,139 --> 00:16:49,638
- It's great. - I know.

518
00:16:49,639 --> 00:16:51,852
- I like it. - This is very sentimental.

519
00:16:52,210 --> 00:16:53,579
The highlight is important.

520
00:16:53,580 --> 00:16:54,808
(Climax is important.)

521
00:16:54,809 --> 00:16:58,648
(Here comes the part where the singing explodes.)

522
00:16:58,649 --> 00:17:02,788
(Listen)

523
00:17:02,789 --> 00:17:06,819
(Jin Young sings in 6 different tones.)

524
00:17:06,820 --> 00:17:09,089
- It's great. - She sings so well.

525
00:17:09,090 --> 00:17:10,959
(Singing hard)

526
00:17:10,960 --> 00:17:13,886
(She puts pressure on her voice.)

527
00:17:14,970 --> 00:17:17,169
(Vibration is the finishing stroke.)

528
00:17:17,170 --> 00:17:19,068
You pushed up your shoulders so much.

529
00:17:19,069 --> 00:17:20,868
She cringed a moment ago.

530
00:17:20,869 --> 00:17:22,169
When you sing high notes,

531
00:17:22,170 --> 00:17:23,669
you use your shoulders.

532
00:17:23,740 --> 00:17:25,679
- I do? - You pushed up your shoulders.

533
00:17:25,680 --> 00:17:28,679
(Is the secret to singing high notes her shoulders?)

534
00:17:28,680 --> 00:17:30,414
I thought she might disappear.

535
00:17:31,019 --> 00:17:34,110
(Her shoulders go up every time her voice vibrates.)

536
00:17:34,789 --> 00:17:39,175
(Squeezing her shoulders is the secret to her singing.)

537
00:17:39,890 --> 00:17:40,910
That's it.

538
00:17:42,730 --> 00:17:44,229
The trot music version is good too.

539
00:17:44,230 --> 00:17:46,328
- It was great. - It's because she's a good singer.

540
00:17:46,329 --> 00:17:48,598
Sae Rok, what's your talent?

541
00:17:48,599 --> 00:17:51,252
In a drama called "Marry Me Now",

542
00:17:51,269 --> 00:17:53,399
- I danced to "Ring Ring". - Did you?

543
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:55,209
I danced at a congratulatory ceremony.

544
00:17:55,210 --> 00:17:58,402
- Can we take a look? - I have to do it with Jin Young.

545
00:17:58,579 --> 00:17:59,661
- Really? - Yes.

546
00:17:59,710 --> 00:18:00,909
Let's see.

547
00:18:00,910 --> 00:18:02,848
(What will her dance to "Ring Ring" look like?)

548
00:18:02,849 --> 00:18:04,449
They're doing it together. They prepared it.

549
00:18:04,450 --> 00:18:05,778
- This is good. - You're doing well.

550
00:18:05,779 --> 00:18:07,048
- Awesome. - Good.

551
00:18:07,049 --> 00:18:08,447
- Here it comes. - Let's go.

552
00:18:08,490 --> 00:18:09,489
Ring Ring

553
00:18:09,490 --> 00:18:11,090
1, 2, to the right.

554
00:18:11,490 --> 00:18:13,189
(Let's go straight to the right.)

555
00:18:13,190 --> 00:18:14,924
To the right?

556
00:18:15,460 --> 00:18:18,528
(I'll be in charge of keeping this performance exciting.)

557
00:18:18,529 --> 00:18:21,969
(The new sheriff shoots cute bullets.)

558
00:18:21,970 --> 00:18:23,326
(She shoots again.)

559
00:18:23,430 --> 00:18:26,538
(The performance is getting more exciting.)

560
00:18:26,539 --> 00:18:28,338
(They dance in sync.)

561
00:18:28,339 --> 00:18:30,209
("Ring Ring" sisters)

562
00:18:30,210 --> 00:18:31,239
She's good.

563
00:18:31,240 --> 00:18:32,508
(She's quite good.)

564
00:18:32,509 --> 00:18:33,529
Start with the right.

565
00:18:34,450 --> 00:18:35,470
Left.

566
00:18:35,950 --> 00:18:38,469
(She imitates her twist step perfectly.)

567
00:18:38,849 --> 00:18:40,848
(She's new but experienced in dancing.)

568
00:18:40,849 --> 00:18:42,649
- She's a good dancer. - Gosh.

569
00:18:42,650 --> 00:18:44,425
- She's good. - Here it comes.

570
00:18:44,759 --> 00:18:46,588
Let's go.

571
00:18:46,589 --> 00:18:50,608
(The climax of "Ring Ring" is coming.)

572
00:18:51,759 --> 00:18:53,629
- Let's go. - "Ring Ring".

573
00:18:53,630 --> 00:18:55,729
(Are you ready for excitement?)

574
00:18:55,730 --> 00:18:57,881
(Ring Ring)

575
00:18:58,839 --> 00:19:01,664
(One more time)

576
00:19:02,539 --> 00:19:05,479
(I'll take care of this round, everyone.)

577
00:19:05,480 --> 00:19:08,641
- She's got the groove. - Dance together, everyone.

578
00:19:09,410 --> 00:19:11,078
She's a good dancer.

579
00:19:11,079 --> 00:19:14,283
(Ring, ring, I'm your older sister)

580
00:19:14,289 --> 00:19:17,655
(I'm the professional on stage today.)

581
00:19:17,990 --> 00:19:19,489
She knows the entire dance.

582
00:19:19,859 --> 00:19:21,588
(The older sister)

583
00:19:21,589 --> 00:19:24,459
(We're Ring Ring sisters.)

584
00:19:24,460 --> 00:19:25,887
They're good.

585
00:19:26,029 --> 00:19:27,169
They're good.

586
00:19:27,170 --> 00:19:29,342
- She was well prepared. - She knows how to dance.

587
00:19:29,369 --> 00:19:31,409
- It's obvious that she can dance. - It was good.

588
00:19:31,599 --> 00:19:35,038
Da Gam, do you have any talent?

589
00:19:35,039 --> 00:19:36,239
(What's Da Gam's talent?)

590
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:38,338
Everyone, I'm good at making acrostic poems.

591
00:19:38,339 --> 00:19:39,401
Really?

592
00:19:39,609 --> 00:19:41,209
- Making acrostic poem? - Yes.

593
00:19:41,210 --> 00:19:42,331
Acrostic poems?

594
00:19:43,480 --> 00:19:45,318
- How about Kim Jong Kook? - I'll try Kim Jong Kook.

595
00:19:45,319 --> 00:19:46,983
- Kim Jong Kook? - Yes.

596
00:19:47,119 --> 00:19:48,118
(She makes an acrostic poem with "Kim Jong Kook".)

597
00:19:48,119 --> 00:19:49,721
All right, please start.

598
00:19:50,019 --> 00:19:51,039
"Kim".

599
00:19:52,490 --> 00:19:54,889
Does he eat salty food like kimchi?

600
00:19:54,890 --> 00:19:56,489
That's good.

601
00:19:56,490 --> 00:19:58,828
"Does he eat salty food like kimchi?"

602
00:19:58,829 --> 00:20:00,084
- All right. - "Jong".

603
00:20:00,970 --> 00:20:03,999
He exercises all day long and only eats chicken breast.

604
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,090
"Kook".

605
00:20:08,339 --> 00:20:10,042
When will you get married?

606
00:20:12,609 --> 00:20:15,909
(When will you get married?)

607
00:20:15,910 --> 00:20:17,179
She made it with care.

608
00:20:17,180 --> 00:20:20,518
(Her acrostic poem is complete with her concern for him.)

609
00:20:20,519 --> 00:20:21,649
(Han Da Gam knows how to complete acrostic poems.)

610
00:20:21,650 --> 00:20:23,649
- The last one was good. - It was surprising.

611
00:20:23,650 --> 00:20:26,358
Let's give a round of applause to these three freshmen.

612
00:20:26,359 --> 00:20:27,379
Welcome.

613
00:20:28,660 --> 00:20:31,586
Today is Spring Orientation Special.

614
00:20:31,759 --> 00:20:33,901
It's Mysterious Returning Student Race.

615
00:20:33,970 --> 00:20:35,255
- What? - "Mysterious"?

616
00:20:35,430 --> 00:20:38,500
Among 11 freshmen invited to the orientation,

617
00:20:38,700 --> 00:20:40,669
there's someone who pretended to be a freshman.

618
00:20:40,670 --> 00:20:42,403
(He bursts out laughing.)

619
00:20:43,069 --> 00:20:46,838
(A returning student pretending to be a freshman?)

620
00:20:46,839 --> 00:20:49,358
There's one tactless returning student.

621
00:20:49,950 --> 00:20:50,979
I told you.

622
00:20:50,980 --> 00:20:52,318
- Lee Bo Gae. - I told you.

623
00:20:52,319 --> 00:20:53,379
Isn't it too easy?

624
00:20:53,380 --> 00:20:56,001
- Isn't it too easy? - You know that it's not me.

625
00:20:56,019 --> 00:20:57,048
You know that it isn't me.

626
00:20:57,049 --> 00:21:00,959
You'll play a total of three rounds of orientation games.

627
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:04,325
If you catch the returning student, freshmen win.

628
00:21:04,500 --> 00:21:05,989
- We must catch the student. - You'll receive prizes.

629
00:21:06,700 --> 00:21:08,606
During every round,

630
00:21:08,829 --> 00:21:11,961
the returning student will carry out a hidden mission.

631
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:14,249
Freshmen will listen to the hints...

632
00:21:14,470 --> 00:21:17,499
and select a student whom they suspect.

633
00:21:17,740 --> 00:21:19,749
If the selected student is the returning student,

634
00:21:19,980 --> 00:21:21,439
your prizes will be accumulated.

635
00:21:21,579 --> 00:21:23,548
If it's not, you'll be punished.

636
00:21:24,680 --> 00:21:27,179
The first game will start.

637
00:21:27,180 --> 00:21:28,548
Okay.

638
00:21:28,549 --> 00:21:30,354
- Let's start. - Okay.

639
00:21:30,519 --> 00:21:31,618
Let's do it.

640
00:21:31,619 --> 00:21:33,394
(What will be the first game?)

641
00:21:33,660 --> 00:21:35,489
(2019 Freshmen Orientation Schedule)

642
00:21:35,490 --> 00:21:37,673
(Orientation Game 1)

643
00:21:37,730 --> 00:21:40,399
We're at an orientation.

644
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:42,768
Our fellow students...

645
00:21:42,769 --> 00:21:45,218
(He uses an old-fashioned word.)

646
00:21:45,500 --> 00:21:46,699
- By the way... - "Fellow"?

647
00:21:46,700 --> 00:21:48,139
- "Fellow"? - That's so old-fashioned.

648
00:21:48,140 --> 00:21:49,567
All of us are returning students.

649
00:21:49,740 --> 00:21:51,820
Our student leader is too old.

650
00:21:52,109 --> 00:21:54,249
We're here together.

651
00:21:54,250 --> 00:21:57,269
People play a lot of games at orientation.

652
00:21:57,349 --> 00:21:59,578
It's called Insider Game these days.

653
00:21:59,579 --> 00:22:00,599
That sounds good.

654
00:22:00,990 --> 00:22:03,396
Insider Game? Let's play a round of I Am Ground.

655
00:22:03,849 --> 00:22:06,588
- Introduce yourself? - I am ground, introduce yourself

656
00:22:06,589 --> 00:22:07,929
It's been a long time.

657
00:22:07,930 --> 00:22:08,950
Cave expedition.

658
00:22:09,430 --> 00:22:10,481
Hotteok.

659
00:22:10,900 --> 00:22:12,058
Cave expedition.

660
00:22:12,059 --> 00:22:13,967
What's this? Is this cave expedition?

661
00:22:14,130 --> 00:22:15,935
- Do you know it, Sae Rok? - Yes.

662
00:22:15,970 --> 00:22:17,439
What is it?

663
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:18,460
Dig poop.

664
00:22:20,299 --> 00:22:22,818
(Dig what? It's shocking.)

665
00:22:23,039 --> 00:22:25,608
- Right. - That's right. I remember that.

666
00:22:25,609 --> 00:22:27,691
That's right.

667
00:22:27,880 --> 00:22:30,837
Only those who know will play. I don't know this.

668
00:22:30,950 --> 00:22:32,118
- You don't know? - Give it a try.

669
00:22:32,119 --> 00:22:34,598
- I am ground, introduce yourself - Start with Ji Hyo.

670
00:22:35,250 --> 00:22:36,310
King Kong shower.

671
00:22:36,589 --> 00:22:37,916
- Dig poop. - It's fun.

672
00:22:37,960 --> 00:22:39,159
Fool.

673
00:22:39,160 --> 00:22:40,281
Cave expedition.

674
00:22:40,460 --> 00:22:41,480
Hotteok.

675
00:22:41,730 --> 00:22:43,668
- Ground, it starts now - Start

676
00:22:45,599 --> 00:22:47,499
Cave expedition. Hotteok.

677
00:22:47,500 --> 00:22:49,469
(So Min calls for hotteok.)

678
00:22:49,470 --> 00:22:51,439
Hotteok. Dig poop.

679
00:22:51,970 --> 00:22:53,939
Dig poop. King Kong shower.

680
00:22:54,509 --> 00:22:55,508
(Ji Hyo is King Kong shower.)

681
00:22:55,509 --> 00:22:57,338
King Kong shower. Dig poop.

682
00:22:57,339 --> 00:23:00,078
(She calls for dig poop but makes a gesture for hotteok.)

683
00:23:00,079 --> 00:23:01,808
- That was hotteok. - She got it wrong.

684
00:23:01,809 --> 00:23:03,709
- She got it wrong. - This isn't easy.

685
00:23:03,710 --> 00:23:05,679
- Does this game still exist? - Does it?

686
00:23:05,680 --> 00:23:08,709
- This is an Insider Game? - This is such an old game.

687
00:23:10,289 --> 00:23:13,659
(It's a game played on "X-man" where insiders gathered 13 years ago.)

688
00:23:13,660 --> 00:23:18,626
(It's one of the games enjoyed by ancient insiders.)

689
00:23:18,759 --> 00:23:21,074
- When is I Am Ground from? - It's an old game.

690
00:23:21,569 --> 00:23:23,303
- It's not an Insider Game, right? - It's an old game.

691
00:23:23,329 --> 00:23:24,568
It's an old game.

692
00:23:24,569 --> 00:23:27,639
We prepared a game called Water Seat Game.

693
00:23:27,640 --> 00:23:28,691
Water Seat Game?

694
00:23:29,569 --> 00:23:30,568
"Water Seat"?

695
00:23:30,569 --> 00:23:34,278
(If you get penalized the least, you gain penalty exemption card.)

696
00:23:34,279 --> 00:23:36,422
- We'll give you calamansi extract. - It's sour.

697
00:23:36,609 --> 00:23:39,618
Those who lose drink a cup as a penalty.

698
00:23:39,619 --> 00:23:40,812
- Calamansi? - Gosh.

699
00:23:42,019 --> 00:23:43,417
It's an actual extract.

700
00:23:43,890 --> 00:23:45,489
It's really yellow.

701
00:23:45,490 --> 00:23:47,318
- The color is so bright. - Goodness.

702
00:23:47,319 --> 00:23:49,088
- It's the color of mustard. - It really is.

703
00:23:49,089 --> 00:23:50,588
Excuse me.

704
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:52,255
Are there substitutes?

705
00:23:52,430 --> 00:23:55,122
- There should be black knights. - Yes.

706
00:23:55,529 --> 00:23:57,162
I'll drink it for you.

707
00:23:57,700 --> 00:23:59,338
- Black knights? - They're allowed.

708
00:23:59,339 --> 00:24:01,348
You drink two cups if you get rejected.

709
00:24:01,369 --> 00:24:03,508
- Jin Young, I'll do it for you. - Will you drink it?

710
00:24:03,509 --> 00:24:04,703
(I'll give you a cup.)

711
00:24:05,009 --> 00:24:07,764
- You have to grant him a wish. - Right.

712
00:24:07,809 --> 00:24:09,709
Sae Rok, I'll drink it for you.

713
00:24:09,710 --> 00:24:10,975
(He sounds so cheesy.)

714
00:24:11,450 --> 00:24:13,662
Everyone. We have...

715
00:24:13,779 --> 00:24:16,489
Running Man's Insider Game Collection.

716
00:24:16,490 --> 00:24:17,510
Is that so?

717
00:24:19,420 --> 00:24:20,659
(2019 Running Man's Insider Game Collection)

718
00:24:20,660 --> 00:24:22,700
(Orange Game)

719
00:24:23,029 --> 00:24:24,324
It's Orange Game.

720
00:24:24,630 --> 00:24:27,761
The first player makes an imaginary small orange with hand movements.

721
00:24:27,829 --> 00:24:30,348
He throws it to the next player.

722
00:24:31,170 --> 00:24:33,648
- Orange, orange - Let's play Orange Game.

723
00:24:34,440 --> 00:24:36,768
- It should be small at first. - It should be small.

724
00:24:36,769 --> 00:24:38,208
Start. Let's start with you.

725
00:24:38,279 --> 00:24:42,594
- Orange, orange, orange - Orange, orange, orange. You.

726
00:24:42,680 --> 00:24:43,904
Here you go.

727
00:24:44,279 --> 00:24:47,176
(He must make an orange bigger than the previous player.)

728
00:24:47,250 --> 00:24:48,310
You.

729
00:24:48,490 --> 00:24:50,906
(Kwang Soo points to Haha.)

730
00:24:51,559 --> 00:24:54,415
(He makes an orange as big as a fist.)

731
00:24:55,259 --> 00:24:57,064
(Haha points to Ji Hyo.)

732
00:24:57,799 --> 00:24:58,929
(Is it bigger than a fist?)

733
00:24:58,930 --> 00:24:59,981
It got bigger.

734
00:25:01,400 --> 00:25:03,028
(It's getting bigger.)

735
00:25:03,029 --> 00:25:04,090
It's dangerous.

736
00:25:04,539 --> 00:25:07,439
(Ji Hyo points to So Min.)

737
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:08,592
(Moving about)

738
00:25:09,369 --> 00:25:11,308
It became much bigger all of a sudden.

739
00:25:11,309 --> 00:25:12,769
Orange, You.

740
00:25:12,980 --> 00:25:14,275
- Make it bigger. - Orange

741
00:25:15,210 --> 00:25:18,177
(The orange is as big as a ball of snow.)

742
00:25:18,950 --> 00:25:20,786
(Da Gam points to Jae Seok.)

743
00:25:21,490 --> 00:25:24,040
(He jumps to lift the orange.)

744
00:25:25,019 --> 00:25:26,018
Goodness.

745
00:25:26,019 --> 00:25:28,129
(Jae Seok points to Seok Jin.)

746
00:25:28,130 --> 00:25:30,332
(Orange, orange)

747
00:25:30,900 --> 00:25:33,888
(It's an orange that Class of 1919 would have.)

748
00:25:34,869 --> 00:25:40,038
(Seok Jin's pronunciation and movement seem old-fashioned.)

749
00:25:40,039 --> 00:25:41,508
Orange. You.

750
00:25:41,509 --> 00:25:43,808
Just do it slowly.

751
00:25:43,809 --> 00:25:45,179
Make it bigger.

752
00:25:45,180 --> 00:25:46,308
(Will Jong Kook make a bigger orange?)

753
00:25:46,309 --> 00:25:47,463
Roll it.

754
00:25:48,849 --> 00:25:50,921
(Shall I make one?)

755
00:25:52,250 --> 00:25:53,318
(It's a genetically modified giant orange.)

756
00:25:53,319 --> 00:25:54,339
That's right.

757
00:25:55,450 --> 00:25:57,490
Orange, orange. You.

758
00:25:57,990 --> 00:26:00,159
It's like the show "Family Game".

759
00:26:00,160 --> 00:26:01,788
(He needs to make an orange bigger than Jong Kook's.)

760
00:26:01,789 --> 00:26:03,328
Hurry up.

761
00:26:03,329 --> 00:26:05,778
(Otherwise, he gets penalized.)

762
00:26:07,029 --> 00:26:09,753
(Grunting)

763
00:26:09,930 --> 00:26:12,199
(He makes an orange planet.)

764
00:26:12,200 --> 00:26:14,338
Orange, orange, orange

765
00:26:14,339 --> 00:26:16,808
(We approve of it.)

766
00:26:16,809 --> 00:26:18,064
- That's good. - You.

767
00:26:19,009 --> 00:26:21,848
(He makes an orange as big as the Earth.)

768
00:26:21,849 --> 00:26:22,909
(He points to Sae Rok.)

769
00:26:22,910 --> 00:26:23,971
It's Sae Rok.

770
00:26:24,349 --> 00:26:26,749
(She's fully ready.)

771
00:26:26,750 --> 00:26:29,095
(What happened to her voice?)

772
00:26:29,589 --> 00:26:31,119
Orange.

773
00:26:31,359 --> 00:26:33,941
Orange, orange

774
00:26:34,289 --> 00:26:35,758
(What's wrong with her voice?)

775
00:26:35,759 --> 00:26:36,779
Who is she?

776
00:26:37,230 --> 00:26:38,760
This is good.

777
00:26:39,359 --> 00:26:41,868
(She makes a giant orange.)

778
00:26:41,869 --> 00:26:43,699
Orange. You.

779
00:26:43,700 --> 00:26:44,999
- Me? - Da Gam.

780
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:46,338
Next is Da Gam.

781
00:26:46,339 --> 00:26:48,176
(She's burning with determination.)

782
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:50,546
- Orange. - What's going on?

783
00:26:51,180 --> 00:26:53,139
(She rolls on the floor.)

784
00:26:53,140 --> 00:26:55,148
- Orange, orange - Da Gam.

785
00:26:55,880 --> 00:26:57,108
Stop it, Da Gam.

786
00:26:57,109 --> 00:26:58,919
(What is this?)

787
00:26:58,920 --> 00:27:01,219
(Orange Game is stopped.)

788
00:27:01,220 --> 00:27:04,149
This won't work. This game won't work.

789
00:27:04,150 --> 00:27:06,358
- We can't find the right game. - We can't find it.

790
00:27:06,359 --> 00:27:08,389
- She should be penalized. - It's my first cup.

791
00:27:08,390 --> 00:27:10,758
(She drinks calamansi that's good for the skin and losing weight.)

792
00:27:10,759 --> 00:27:13,921
Do other fellow students know of another game?

793
00:27:14,059 --> 00:27:16,344
I know one.

794
00:27:16,369 --> 00:27:18,169
Orange fart

795
00:27:18,170 --> 00:27:21,331
- Whose orange fart is it? - There's Orange Fart.

796
00:27:21,569 --> 00:27:24,239
You farted. Then you say, "Farting".

797
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:26,044
- Those next to you say, "It smells" - It smells

798
00:27:26,140 --> 00:27:27,909
- This is cute. - Who gets penalized?

799
00:27:27,910 --> 00:27:29,379
The one who laughs.

800
00:27:29,380 --> 00:27:31,249
- Okay, it sounds good. - It'll be fun.

801
00:27:31,250 --> 00:27:32,318
(They try Orange Fart.)

802
00:27:32,319 --> 00:27:33,578
- This is it. - Keep your face expressionless.

803
00:27:33,579 --> 00:27:34,743
- Keep your face expressionless. - Okay.

804
00:27:34,789 --> 00:27:37,149
- You can make others laugh. - This is it.

805
00:27:37,150 --> 00:27:38,959
Anyone who laughs...

806
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:39,959
- Anyone who shows their teeth. - will be penalized.

807
00:27:39,960 --> 00:27:42,376
- Okay, start. - Start with Kwang Soo.

808
00:27:42,759 --> 00:27:46,983
- Whose orange fart is it? - Whose orange fart is it?

809
00:27:47,130 --> 00:27:48,701
You farted

810
00:27:48,869 --> 00:27:50,767
Farting

811
00:27:50,869 --> 00:27:52,533
- It smells - It smells

812
00:27:52,799 --> 00:27:56,440
- Whose orange fart is it? - Whose orange fart is it?

813
00:27:56,539 --> 00:27:58,274
You farted

814
00:27:58,380 --> 00:28:00,008
Farting

815
00:28:00,009 --> 00:28:01,029
(Laughing)

816
00:28:01,450 --> 00:28:02,649
(She fails as she laughs.)

817
00:28:02,650 --> 00:28:03,848
It smells

818
00:28:03,849 --> 00:28:06,518
- I couldn't hold back. - That's a failure.

819
00:28:06,519 --> 00:28:09,069
It's embarrassing in case I really fart.

820
00:28:09,650 --> 00:28:11,318
(She's ready for calamansi.)

821
00:28:11,319 --> 00:28:12,339
So Min is out.

822
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:13,919
(It must be so sour.)

823
00:28:13,920 --> 00:28:14,950
Is it very sour?

824
00:28:15,759 --> 00:28:18,350
(It's a shot of sour and sweet calamansi.)

825
00:28:18,630 --> 00:28:21,180
I could have drunk it for you.

826
00:28:21,630 --> 00:28:22,729
- Start. - Start with So Min.

827
00:28:22,730 --> 00:28:26,615
- Whose orange fart is it? - Whose orange fart is it?

828
00:28:26,670 --> 00:28:28,301
You farted

829
00:28:28,440 --> 00:28:30,969
I fart

830
00:28:30,970 --> 00:28:32,949
("I fart"?)

831
00:28:34,140 --> 00:28:35,170
Wait.

832
00:28:35,380 --> 00:28:36,981
(It's a warning for laughter.)

833
00:28:37,380 --> 00:28:38,379
(Sae Rok got it wrong.)

834
00:28:38,380 --> 00:28:40,358
She was wrong. You can talk, Da Gam.

835
00:28:41,619 --> 00:28:42,949
(Sae Rok failed, so she must drink.)

836
00:28:42,950 --> 00:28:44,652
- Sae Rok. - "Farting".

837
00:28:44,920 --> 00:28:47,846
- Field by the village entrance - Orchard one shot

838
00:28:47,960 --> 00:28:50,358
- Do it again. - Yes, yes, yes

839
00:28:50,359 --> 00:28:51,899
- 21 shot - 21 shot

840
00:28:51,900 --> 00:28:53,399
- Did she drink it? - Goodness.

841
00:28:53,400 --> 00:28:54,798
(Sae Rok takes it in one shot.)

842
00:28:54,799 --> 00:28:56,839
- It must be bitter. - Start.

843
00:28:57,029 --> 00:29:00,915
- Whose orange fart is it? - Whose orange fart is it?

844
00:29:01,069 --> 00:29:02,874
You farted

845
00:29:03,410 --> 00:29:04,838
(What's wrong with her voice again?)

846
00:29:04,839 --> 00:29:06,542
Farting

847
00:29:06,609 --> 00:29:08,446
- It smells - It smells

848
00:29:08,549 --> 00:29:12,150
- Whose orange fart is it? - Whose orange fart is it?

849
00:29:12,319 --> 00:29:13,952
You farted

850
00:29:14,220 --> 00:29:16,219
Farting

851
00:29:16,220 --> 00:29:17,858
(She's extremely bubbly.)

852
00:29:17,859 --> 00:29:18,858
(She farts very close to his face.)

853
00:29:18,859 --> 00:29:20,689
- It smells - It smells

854
00:29:20,690 --> 00:29:23,995
- Whose orange fart is it? - Whose orange fart is it?

855
00:29:24,430 --> 00:29:26,758
(It's Da Gam's turn to point.)

856
00:29:26,759 --> 00:29:30,568
(She hums.)

857
00:29:30,569 --> 00:29:32,130
(You can talk.)

858
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:34,068
(You can't laugh, but you can talk.)

859
00:29:34,069 --> 00:29:35,909
- What is she doing? - Come on.

860
00:29:35,910 --> 00:29:37,169
- You are... - She's...

861
00:29:37,170 --> 00:29:40,409
Nothing changed other than her name.

862
00:29:40,410 --> 00:29:41,879
(You're right.)

863
00:29:41,880 --> 00:29:44,532
- Da Gam. - She's terrible.

864
00:29:46,380 --> 00:29:48,149
(She drinks her second cup of calamansi.)

865
00:29:48,150 --> 00:29:49,588
It must be sour.

866
00:29:49,589 --> 00:29:53,058
Let's play the K-pop Star Game.

867
00:29:53,059 --> 00:29:54,283
(2019 Running Man's Insider Game Collection)

868
00:29:54,319 --> 00:29:56,328
(K-pop Star Game)

869
00:29:56,930 --> 00:30:01,868
(Sing a song that contains the given word in order.)

870
00:30:01,869 --> 00:30:03,665
Is there any starting phrase?

871
00:30:03,970 --> 00:30:05,399
K-pop songs

872
00:30:05,400 --> 00:30:06,669
(It sounds mellow.)

873
00:30:06,670 --> 00:30:08,439
- K-pop songs - Wait.

874
00:30:08,440 --> 00:30:10,909
- Goodness. - The melody itself is terrible.

875
00:30:10,910 --> 00:30:11,961
(It's not like an Insider Game.)

876
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:14,173
The melody isn't like an insider.

877
00:30:14,279 --> 00:30:16,115
Let's just do this.

878
00:30:16,210 --> 00:30:18,015
Start by saying "K-pop".

879
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:19,949
(It feels so old-fashioned.)

880
00:30:19,950 --> 00:30:21,652
- Are you startled? - Let's do that.

881
00:30:21,920 --> 00:30:23,826
Come on, it's still an Insider Game.

882
00:30:24,119 --> 00:30:26,262
"K-pop" sounds silly.

883
00:30:26,759 --> 00:30:29,890
K-pop is good music

884
00:30:30,329 --> 00:30:32,808
(It's the returning student's perfect singing method.)

885
00:30:33,259 --> 00:30:35,268
(It's an old-fashioned phrase that an old man would sing.)

886
00:30:35,269 --> 00:30:37,199
He sounds like an old man.

887
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:39,568
- K-pop - What kind of Insider Game goes...

888
00:30:39,569 --> 00:30:42,739
- K-pop is good music? - K-pop is good music

889
00:30:42,740 --> 00:30:44,065
K-pop

890
00:30:44,109 --> 00:30:46,149
That's good. I start.

891
00:30:46,180 --> 00:30:47,710
Start.

892
00:30:47,740 --> 00:30:52,004
- K-pop is good music, K-pop - K-pop is good music, K-pop

893
00:30:52,049 --> 00:30:54,160
- The keyword is "Our". - "Our"?

894
00:30:55,420 --> 00:30:57,149
(Our meeting is)

895
00:30:57,150 --> 00:30:59,219
Goodness, this is insane.

896
00:30:59,220 --> 00:31:00,616
(I was going to sing this song.)

897
00:31:01,089 --> 00:31:08,138
("Meeting" by Noh Sa Yeon released in 1982 is an old song.)

898
00:31:08,700 --> 00:31:10,629
(Everyone panics.)

899
00:31:10,630 --> 00:31:11,894
I was going to sing this song.

900
00:31:12,069 --> 00:31:13,324
K-pop

901
00:31:13,940 --> 00:31:16,152
(Our river and mountain are good)

902
00:31:16,539 --> 00:31:19,008
(Suddenly it turns into a public service advertisement.)

903
00:31:19,009 --> 00:31:20,100
- You're out. - Come on.

904
00:31:20,180 --> 00:31:22,379
(Haha sings a song for a public service advertisement and fails.)

905
00:31:22,380 --> 00:31:23,878
I was going to sing his song.

906
00:31:24,009 --> 00:31:25,318
I'm serious.

907
00:31:25,319 --> 00:31:27,048
- Drink. - Drink, drink

908
00:31:27,049 --> 00:31:28,650
Drink, drink

909
00:31:28,690 --> 00:31:31,258
Drink today and tomorrow.

910
00:31:31,259 --> 00:31:32,858
Ask your Mapo-gu sibling.

911
00:31:32,859 --> 00:31:35,159
- She would drink it. - Ask your Mapo-gu sibling.

912
00:31:35,160 --> 00:31:37,403
- Ask her. - She'll do it for you.

913
00:31:37,660 --> 00:31:38,680
Mapo-gu.

914
00:31:39,660 --> 00:31:41,058
(Furtive)

915
00:31:41,059 --> 00:31:42,298
(Ask Sae Rok instead.)

916
00:31:42,299 --> 00:31:43,350
Sae Rok.

917
00:31:43,400 --> 00:31:44,768
Be my substitute.

918
00:31:44,769 --> 00:31:46,239
(Will you be my substitute?)

919
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:48,469
I'll protect Mapo-gu. I refuse.

920
00:31:48,470 --> 00:31:50,508
(I'll protect Mapo-gu. I refuse.)

921
00:31:50,509 --> 00:31:52,538
(The protector of Mapo-gu is firm.)

922
00:31:52,539 --> 00:31:54,038
- Okay. - Okay, two cups.

923
00:31:54,140 --> 00:31:55,638
- Drink 2 cups. - Drink 2.

924
00:31:56,410 --> 00:31:58,185
- Okay. - Drink two, Haha.

925
00:31:59,450 --> 00:32:00,479
Okay, Mapo-gu.

926
00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:03,018
(He tries again to the resident of Mapo-gu.)

927
00:32:03,019 --> 00:32:04,376
I got confused for a moment.

928
00:32:05,059 --> 00:32:07,118
- I beg you. - Okay, Mapo-gu.

929
00:32:07,119 --> 00:32:13,484
(He asks his long-time Mapo-gu sibling to drink 2 cups)

930
00:32:13,730 --> 00:32:15,298
- I refuse. - Okay.

931
00:32:15,299 --> 00:32:17,614
(She rejects after thinking.)

932
00:32:17,769 --> 00:32:20,045
- 4 cups. - 4 cups.

933
00:32:20,700 --> 00:32:21,730
Drink four.

934
00:32:21,940 --> 00:32:22,991
Try it again.

935
00:32:24,009 --> 00:32:25,917
Stop it and drink them yourself.

936
00:32:26,410 --> 00:32:27,439
You wait and see.

937
00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:29,749
(Sae Rok and Ji Hyo, wait and see.)

938
00:32:29,750 --> 00:32:31,515
(He drinks them with his eyes closed.)

939
00:32:31,680 --> 00:32:33,278
It makes my mouth water.

940
00:32:33,279 --> 00:32:35,548
- He should have drunk one. - Okay, okay.

941
00:32:35,549 --> 00:32:37,548
(We're sorry, Haha.)

942
00:32:37,549 --> 00:32:38,959
- All right. - Start with Haha.

943
00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:40,858
- Yes, let's start with Haha. - It starts now.

944
00:32:40,859 --> 00:32:42,229
- Here it comes. - "Her".

945
00:32:42,230 --> 00:32:44,258
- Okay, start. - "Her"?

946
00:32:44,259 --> 00:32:47,159
- K-pop is good music - K-pop is good music

947
00:32:47,160 --> 00:32:48,328
- K-pop - K-pop

948
00:32:48,329 --> 00:32:51,129
(It goes counterclockwise starting Haha. )

949
00:32:51,130 --> 00:32:52,538
(To her)

950
00:32:52,539 --> 00:32:54,610
(Which song has such an antique melody?)

951
00:32:55,470 --> 00:33:02,896
("Please Tell Her" by Firetruck was released in 1987.)

952
00:33:03,509 --> 00:33:04,679
(Go, Jong Kook.)

953
00:33:04,680 --> 00:33:05,945
K-pop

954
00:33:07,349 --> 00:33:10,002
(I know her better than anyone)

955
00:33:10,619 --> 00:33:14,741
(The lyrics include "her", but which song is it?)

956
00:33:15,559 --> 00:33:18,798
(I know her better than anyone)

957
00:33:18,799 --> 00:33:21,044
- It's my song. - K-pop

958
00:33:21,299 --> 00:33:22,528
(Jong Kook is an amazing singer.)

959
00:33:22,529 --> 00:33:23,929
He sings so well.

960
00:33:23,930 --> 00:33:25,169
(It was his own song.)

961
00:33:25,170 --> 00:33:26,221
It's nice.

962
00:33:26,839 --> 00:33:29,169
(It's Seok Jin's turn.)

963
00:33:29,170 --> 00:33:31,148
(She was very pretty)

964
00:33:31,940 --> 00:33:33,979
("She Was Pretty" by Park Jin Young)

965
00:33:33,980 --> 00:33:34,979
You don't know...

966
00:33:34,980 --> 00:33:37,356
(It's the song that everyone was thinking about.)

967
00:33:38,049 --> 00:33:39,650
You don't know the rest of the lyrics.

968
00:33:40,019 --> 00:33:41,749
- What? - What are the lyrics?

969
00:33:41,750 --> 00:33:43,348
(She was very pretty)

970
00:33:43,349 --> 00:33:44,548
(As if)

971
00:33:44,549 --> 00:33:47,318
(She might rise to the sky)

972
00:33:47,319 --> 00:33:49,533
(Does she suddenly rise to the sky?)

973
00:33:50,730 --> 00:33:52,668
What? What did he say?

974
00:33:53,559 --> 00:33:55,798
- Wait a minute. - What do you mean?

975
00:33:55,799 --> 00:33:57,910
Are you telling her to go to the underworld?

976
00:33:57,930 --> 00:33:59,598
Is she a fairy?

977
00:33:59,599 --> 00:34:01,538
"She was very pretty". How far do I have to sing?

978
00:34:01,539 --> 00:34:02,808
- Is it two verses? - No,

979
00:34:02,809 --> 00:34:04,849
- I got it. - but you should sing more.

980
00:34:05,180 --> 00:34:07,220
- Let's go around once. - Seriously.

981
00:34:07,309 --> 00:34:09,749
- Seriously. - We stop at the third player.

982
00:34:09,750 --> 00:34:11,008
Let's do this.

983
00:34:11,009 --> 00:34:12,179
- Fellow students. - Yes?

984
00:34:12,180 --> 00:34:14,291
- Let's work harder. - Okay.

985
00:34:14,650 --> 00:34:15,975
Let's go, Class of 2019.

986
00:34:16,389 --> 00:34:18,089
(We're freshmen.)

987
00:34:18,090 --> 00:34:19,793
- Let's go. - Here's the keyword.

988
00:34:20,019 --> 00:34:21,089
- Okay. - Let's go.

989
00:34:21,090 --> 00:34:22,110
"Man"?

990
00:34:22,159 --> 00:34:25,627
- Start, K-pop is good music - K-pop is good music

991
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:27,356
- K-pop - K-pop

992
00:34:27,559 --> 00:34:29,499
- There's a man - It was mine.

993
00:34:29,500 --> 00:34:30,598
(Seok Jin steals a song.)

994
00:34:30,599 --> 00:34:33,016
Wait, your tone isn't going up

995
00:34:33,800 --> 00:34:35,136
Listen to the original song.

996
00:34:35,570 --> 00:34:38,538
- How can I go any higher? - You shouldn't sing if you can't.

997
00:34:38,780 --> 00:34:40,638
(The original singer sings it correctly.)

998
00:34:40,639 --> 00:34:42,852
- Start. - K-pop

999
00:34:43,550 --> 00:34:45,649
(He pronounces clearly.)

1000
00:34:45,650 --> 00:34:46,670
It went up.

1001
00:34:47,349 --> 00:34:50,818
(There's a man who loved you very much)

1002
00:34:50,920 --> 00:34:55,129
(His blood pressure is at its top.)

1003
00:34:55,130 --> 00:34:57,229
(He hits his limit.)

1004
00:34:57,230 --> 00:34:58,759
(He's out of tune.)

1005
00:34:58,760 --> 00:35:00,029
What's this?

1006
00:35:00,030 --> 00:35:01,299
- K-pop - K-pop

1007
00:35:01,300 --> 00:35:03,370
(They approve of his singing.)

1008
00:35:04,670 --> 00:35:08,439
(You don't understand men)

1009
00:35:08,440 --> 00:35:09,908
(The melody sounds strange.)

1010
00:35:09,909 --> 00:35:10,929
What?

1011
00:35:11,639 --> 00:35:13,138
Wait, I'm serious.

1012
00:35:13,139 --> 00:35:15,479
(Does Kwang Soo not know the melody?)

1013
00:35:15,480 --> 00:35:17,009
That's enough. Wait.

1014
00:35:17,010 --> 00:35:18,218
(This is the original tune.)

1015
00:35:18,219 --> 00:35:19,271
Is it Buzz?

1016
00:35:19,949 --> 00:35:22,704
("You Don't Know Men" by Buzz)

1017
00:35:22,789 --> 00:35:27,513
(You don't know men)

1018
00:35:28,389 --> 00:35:30,928
(He tries again.)

1019
00:35:30,929 --> 00:35:32,082
What are you doing?

1020
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:33,799
(It's worse than before.)

1021
00:35:33,800 --> 00:35:35,298
That's wrong, Kwang Soo.

1022
00:35:35,730 --> 00:35:39,339
(A singer demonstrates. This is it.)

1023
00:35:39,340 --> 00:35:40,439
- Isn't it the same? - No.

1024
00:35:40,440 --> 00:35:41,638
- You don't know - You don't know

1025
00:35:41,639 --> 00:35:44,979
(He tries again.)

1026
00:35:44,980 --> 00:35:46,538
(Just drink it.)

1027
00:35:46,539 --> 00:35:48,284
(Is this it?)

1028
00:35:49,510 --> 00:35:50,948
(Kwang Soo doesn't know the tune.)

1029
00:35:50,949 --> 00:35:52,550
Don't do it if you don't know the song.

1030
00:35:52,650 --> 00:35:54,353
Let's start on the other side.

1031
00:35:54,449 --> 00:35:56,592
- You should start this time. - Me?

1032
00:35:56,619 --> 00:35:58,293
They keep getting wrong. Start.

1033
00:35:58,389 --> 00:36:01,259

That's good.

(It sounds very sweet.)

1045
00:36:23,650 --> 00:36:24,678
It's good.

00:36:56,679 --> 00:36:57,832
I love you

1059
00:36:58,579 --> 00:37:01,848
("Rain and Your Story" repeats "love" more than 20 times.)

1060
00:37:01,849 --> 00:37:03,042
- K-pop - K-pop

1061
00:37:03,349 --> 00:37:04,549
(Next is Haha.)

1062
00:37:04,550 --> 00:37:05,947
This is Lee Hyun Do's version.

1063
00:37:06,059 --> 00:37:08,689
- I love you - Right. I know.

1064
00:37:08,690 --> 00:37:10,529
(He mimics the dance as well.)

1065
00:37:10,530 --> 00:37:12,365
- 2, 3. K-pop - K-pop

1066
00:37:12,500 --> 00:37:16,681
I love you from your head to your toes

1067
00:37:17,599 --> 00:37:18,638
I forgot about that.

1068
00:37:18,639 --> 00:37:19,792
- K-pop - K-pop

1069
00:37:20,139 --> 00:37:21,138
(Next is Seok Jin.)

1070
00:37:21,139 --> 00:37:22,169
This is Yim Jae Beom.

1071
00:37:22,170 --> 00:37:24,923
Because of love

1072
00:37:25,380 --> 00:37:26,879
(His tune is unstable once again.)

1073
00:37:26,880 --> 00:37:28,818
(What is this song?)

1074
00:37:29,610 --> 00:37:31,249
(Because of love)

1075
00:37:31,250 --> 00:37:32,270
Don't you know?

1076
00:37:32,820 --> 00:37:36,488
(It's "Love" from the drama "City Hunter)

1077
00:37:36,489 --> 00:37:39,009
- Because of love - I know this song.

1078
00:37:39,460 --> 00:37:41,518
(Next is Kwang Soo.)

1079
00:37:41,519 --> 00:37:43,018
- Right? K-pop - K-pop

1080
00:37:43,489 --> 00:37:47,335
- I love you - Oh, right.

1081
00:37:47,400 --> 00:37:50,020
- I'm happy - He loves that song.

1082
00:37:50,199 --> 00:37:51,352
- K-pop - K-pop

1083
00:37:51,530 --> 00:37:54,293
I love you

1084
00:37:54,369 --> 00:37:56,709
I will follow my heart

1085
00:37:56,710 --> 00:37:58,609
Why do you sing so disgustingly?

1086
00:37:58,610 --> 00:38:01,339
(Jae Seok mocks him.)

1087
00:38:01,340 --> 00:38:02,779
- Hold on. - Why?

1088
00:38:02,780 --> 00:38:04,789
- Were you talking about me? - Goodness.

1089
00:38:04,880 --> 00:38:07,779
You did. You were singing disgustingly.

1090
00:38:07,780 --> 00:38:09,319
- What do you mean? - He looked really weird.

1091
00:38:09,320 --> 00:38:10,543
I love you

1092
00:38:10,650 --> 00:38:15,388
(He sang the ugly version of "Asparagus" by Kim Kyung Ho.)

1093
00:38:15,389 --> 00:38:16,858
It was too high.

1094
00:38:17,389 --> 00:38:19,267
Goodness. All right, then.

1095
00:38:19,360 --> 00:38:20,553
- K-pop - K-pop

1096
00:38:21,059 --> 00:38:22,928
(Next is Ji Hyo.)

1097
00:38:22,929 --> 00:38:25,399
I love you

1098
00:38:25,400 --> 00:38:27,306
(It's Jin Young's song.)

1099
00:38:27,739 --> 00:38:29,268
I love you

1100
00:38:29,269 --> 00:38:30,839
(They continue to get more songs right.)

1101
00:38:30,840 --> 00:38:32,982
- She sang English lyrics. - That's Position.

1102
00:38:33,510 --> 00:38:35,279
(With her outstanding singing skills,)

1103
00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:36,942
(Jin Young also gets it right.)

1104
00:38:37,210 --> 00:38:40,617
(So Min also gets it right with her perfect dance moves.)

1105
00:38:40,980 --> 00:38:44,897
(Da Gam sings an old song and gets it right.)

1106
00:38:44,989 --> 00:38:45,988
Goodness.

1107
00:38:45,989 --> 00:38:48,305
(It's his turn soon, but he's stuck.)

1108
00:38:48,460 --> 00:38:49,459
- K-pop - K-pop

1109
00:38:49,460 --> 00:38:51,265
This is Brown Eyed Girls.

1110
00:38:51,590 --> 00:38:52,928
- You need to sing it. - Sing it.

1111
00:38:52,929 --> 00:38:54,766
- I can't remember. - You must.

1112
00:38:54,800 --> 00:38:56,330
- 5. - 4.

1113
00:38:56,369 --> 00:38:58,899
- Three. - He's wrong.

1114
00:38:58,900 --> 00:38:59,961
He's wrong!

1115
00:39:00,139 --> 00:39:01,569
(He fails to sing the song.)

1116
00:39:01,570 --> 00:39:03,209
Goodness, I almost got it.

1117
00:39:03,210 --> 00:39:06,136
- All that you said was L, O, V, E. - No.

1118
00:39:06,280 --> 00:39:08,479
Your voice is tingling me

1119
00:39:08,480 --> 00:39:10,249
Do you hear me? I need you, I love you

1120
00:39:10,250 --> 00:39:11,301
Right.

1121
00:39:11,679 --> 00:39:13,819
- It's Brown Eyed Girls. - This is hard.

1122
00:39:13,820 --> 00:39:16,063
(He drinks the juice.)

1123
00:39:16,219 --> 00:39:17,948
We started off by playing insider's games,

1124
00:39:17,949 --> 00:39:20,162
but now, we're beginning to look like the "Family Game".

1125
00:39:20,289 --> 00:39:21,518
One bottle of soju, please.

1126
00:39:21,519 --> 00:39:24,385
(He's suffocated.)

1127
00:39:24,460 --> 00:39:26,744
- Can we play a game we know? - One bottle of soju, please.

1128
00:39:27,130 --> 00:39:28,730
Make sure you order an appetizer.

1129
00:39:29,130 --> 00:39:31,669
This could be the hidden mission. "Lose in the game."

1130
00:39:31,670 --> 00:39:33,399
(The returning student could be given this mission.)

1131
00:39:33,400 --> 00:39:34,499
- "Lose in the game." - The whole time?

1132
00:39:34,500 --> 00:39:36,038
Maybe they need to interrupt the game.

1133
00:39:36,039 --> 00:39:37,641
(The game failed because of a few of them.)

1134
00:39:38,539 --> 00:39:41,814
(Da Gam didn't bother to make an orange and rolled around.)

1135
00:39:42,449 --> 00:39:45,847
(During the Orange Game, she failed by talking mute.)

1136
00:39:46,250 --> 00:39:49,921
(Kwang Soo also failed by not getting the tune right.)

1137
00:39:49,989 --> 00:39:55,120
(Seok Jin kept failing due to incorrect lyrics.)

1138
00:39:55,329 --> 00:39:56,658
Who's the returning student?

1139
00:39:56,659 --> 00:39:58,388
(There are many suspicious candidates.)

1140
00:39:58,389 --> 00:39:59,960
You are the most suspicious one.

1141
00:40:00,659 --> 00:40:02,799
- Who is it? - There's something going on.

1142
00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:04,870
(What was the hidden mission? And who did it?)

1143
00:40:05,369 --> 00:40:09,038
(Amongst the suspicion, Water Seat Game begins.)

1144
00:40:09,039 --> 00:40:11,308
(They fail and drink.)

1145
00:40:11,309 --> 00:40:13,908
(They fail again...)

1146
00:40:13,909 --> 00:40:15,612
(and drink.)

1147
00:40:15,710 --> 00:40:18,819
(The game ends with none of them becoming insiders.)

1148
00:40:18,820 --> 00:40:21,634
(All that they've succeeded to do is drink the juice.)

1149
00:40:21,719 --> 00:40:22,988
- The winner is Se Chan. - Okay.

1150
00:40:22,989 --> 00:40:24,988
- What? - I didn't drink the juice at all.

1151
00:40:25,289 --> 00:40:26,788
- You're exempted. - Okay.

1152
00:40:26,789 --> 00:40:28,901
(Se Chan receives the penalty exemption card.)

1153
00:40:28,929 --> 00:40:31,689
Now, it's the first Apprehension Time.

1154
00:40:31,690 --> 00:40:33,332
(It's time to catch the returning student.)

1155
00:40:34,500 --> 00:40:35,729
I have no idea.

1156
00:40:35,730 --> 00:40:37,098
(Who is the returning student?)

1157
00:40:37,099 --> 00:40:38,670
What did that student do?

1158
00:40:39,500 --> 00:40:42,600
- Everyone. - I really have no idea.

1159
00:40:43,309 --> 00:40:47,138
Each of you will get a chance to guess who it is.

1160
00:40:47,139 --> 00:40:49,557
If that person turns out to be the returning student,

1161
00:40:49,679 --> 00:40:50,904
your prizes will be accumulated.

1162
00:40:51,110 --> 00:40:54,240
If you guessed wrong, your penalties will be accumulated.

1163
00:40:54,420 --> 00:40:56,089
On top of that, the returning student...

1164
00:40:56,090 --> 00:40:59,455
has failed the first mission.

1165
00:40:59,659 --> 00:41:00,658
They failed?

1166
00:41:00,659 --> 00:41:03,382
(The returning student has failed the first round.)

1167
00:41:03,690 --> 00:41:04,751
They failed?

1168
00:41:04,929 --> 00:41:07,276
- They failed. - The student failed.

1169
00:41:07,360 --> 00:41:11,408
Because of that, you will all be given a crucial hint.

1170
00:41:11,630 --> 00:41:15,169
The student mentioned often about age and rank.

1171
00:41:15,170 --> 00:41:16,363
(The student talked often about age and rank.)

1172
00:41:17,340 --> 00:41:18,360
Age and rank?

1173
00:41:20,039 --> 00:41:21,279
(Who was it?)

1174
00:41:21,280 --> 00:41:23,217
Seok Jin told Da Geum...

1175
00:41:23,550 --> 00:41:24,549
What was that?

1176
00:41:24,550 --> 00:41:27,130
(Ji Hyo gets Da Gam's name wrong.)

1177
00:41:28,690 --> 00:41:30,718
(She gets their guest's name wrong.)

1178
00:41:30,719 --> 00:41:31,859
Apologize.

1179
00:41:31,860 --> 00:41:33,459
Ji Hyo.

1180
00:41:33,460 --> 00:41:35,836
- I'm so sorry. - Goodness.

1181
00:41:36,030 --> 00:41:38,305
How could you get her name wrong?

1182
00:41:38,630 --> 00:41:40,598
Be at ease.

1183
00:41:40,599 --> 00:41:41,926
Seok Jin...

1184
00:41:42,230 --> 00:41:44,617
talked to Sae Rok about age.

1185
00:41:44,769 --> 00:41:46,038
To Da Geum, he...

1186
00:41:46,039 --> 00:41:47,339
(She gets it wrong once again.)

1187
00:41:47,340 --> 00:41:48,390
"Da Geum"?

1188
00:41:49,510 --> 00:41:50,509
("Da Geum" will be the most-searched keyword.)

1189
00:41:50,510 --> 00:41:51,638
Come on.

1190
00:41:51,639 --> 00:41:53,618
Why do you keep getting her name wrong?

1191
00:41:54,340 --> 00:41:56,523
That was hilarious.

1192
00:41:56,650 --> 00:41:57,649
Da Gam...

1193
00:41:57,650 --> 00:41:59,353
- You can relax. - Da Gam...

1194
00:41:59,380 --> 00:42:01,948
He talked to Da Gam about something.

1195
00:42:01,949 --> 00:42:03,479
He talked about how they used...

1196
00:42:03,949 --> 00:42:05,149
to be on TV together in the past.

1197
00:42:05,150 --> 00:42:07,056
I did. I wanted to ask her for a favor.

1198
00:42:07,590 --> 00:42:08,610
That's why.

1199
00:42:09,460 --> 00:42:10,928
Da Gam was on TV with me often...

1200
00:42:10,929 --> 00:42:12,658
- back in the day. - Okay.

1201
00:42:12,659 --> 00:42:14,974
Do you remember? Do you?

1202
00:42:15,059 --> 00:42:17,499
It was on KBS, Da Gam.

1203
00:42:17,500 --> 00:42:19,598
(He emphasized being her senior. Is he the one?)

1204
00:42:19,599 --> 00:42:21,609
You should all know that I'm not the returning student.

1205
00:42:22,469 --> 00:42:23,569
- I mean... - We need...

1206
00:42:23,570 --> 00:42:27,048
to remember who it was that sang many old songs.

1207
00:42:27,510 --> 00:42:28,530
I think...

1208
00:42:28,750 --> 00:42:30,948
- it's Da Gam. - Me, too.

1209
00:42:30,949 --> 00:42:32,511
- Right? - I think...

1210
00:42:33,550 --> 00:42:37,888
(The returning student mentioned things about age.)

1211
00:42:37,889 --> 00:42:44,458
(Da Gam sang many 80s songs, emphasizing her age.)

1212
00:42:45,429 --> 00:42:48,399
(Did she do that on purpose? Is she the returning student?)

1213
00:42:48,400 --> 00:42:52,368
But Haha also pretended to be our senior...

1214
00:42:52,369 --> 00:42:54,684
and said he could do this and that for us.

1215
00:42:55,170 --> 00:42:56,260
He said that.

1216
00:42:56,610 --> 00:42:58,548
(He suddenly offered to drink the juice.)

1217
00:42:59,510 --> 00:43:00,678
(Is he the returning student?)

1218
00:43:00,679 --> 00:43:02,749
- What? - It was weird for him to offer...

1219
00:43:02,750 --> 00:43:04,076
to drink for her.

1220
00:43:04,480 --> 00:43:06,218
What's so weird about that?

1221
00:43:06,219 --> 00:43:07,779
(She suspects Haha.)

1222
00:43:07,780 --> 00:43:09,177
Now, please pick...

1223
00:43:09,289 --> 00:43:11,054
one person each.

1224
00:43:11,250 --> 00:43:13,759
Jin Young, whose name was mentioned the most?

1225
00:43:13,760 --> 00:43:15,972
We picked Seok Jin and Haha.

1226
00:43:16,559 --> 00:43:17,928
(They picked Seok Jin and Haha the most.)

1227
00:43:17,929 --> 00:43:19,082
For us, it was Da Gam.

1228
00:43:19,829 --> 00:43:21,899
- So it boiled down to three. - All right.

1229
00:43:21,900 --> 00:43:23,268
- Let's vote. - Okay.

1230
00:43:23,269 --> 00:43:25,167
Wait. Who's the most talkative here?

1231
00:43:25,230 --> 00:43:26,268
It's you.

1232
00:43:26,269 --> 00:43:27,831
(You're the culprit.)

1233
00:43:28,599 --> 00:43:30,638
(If the most talkative one is the returning student,)

1234
00:43:30,639 --> 00:43:33,308
(it's definitely Seok Jin.)

1235
00:43:33,309 --> 00:43:35,114
- Don't make us suspect you. - Gosh.

1236
00:43:35,309 --> 00:43:37,085
- Oh, it's me. - Don't do that.

1237
00:43:37,110 --> 00:43:38,919
Usually, the most talkative one is the culprit.

1238
00:43:38,920 --> 00:43:40,480
Let's start with Haha.

1239
00:43:40,849 --> 00:43:43,319
1, 2, 3.

1240
00:43:43,320 --> 00:43:44,819
(The 1st candidate is Haha.)

1241
00:43:44,820 --> 00:43:46,391
- No one? - No.

1242
00:43:46,489 --> 00:43:47,618
Next is Seok Jin.

1243
00:43:47,619 --> 00:43:48,759
1, 2, 3.

1244
00:43:48,760 --> 00:43:51,529
(The 2nd candidate is Seok Jin.)

1245
00:43:51,530 --> 00:43:53,928
(He gets 3 votes.)

1246
00:43:53,929 --> 00:43:55,198
- 3 people. - 3.

1247
00:43:55,199 --> 00:43:56,251
Next is Da Gam.

1248
00:43:57,199 --> 00:43:59,107
Next is Da Gam. 1, 2, 3.

1249
00:43:59,139 --> 00:44:01,179
- She was obvious. - Da Gam.

1250
00:44:01,269 --> 00:44:02,609
Next is Da Gam.

1251
00:44:02,610 --> 00:44:06,250
(The 3rd candidate, Da Gam, receives 7 votes.)

1252
00:44:06,679 --> 00:44:08,209
- Da Gam. - Hey, how could you?

1253
00:44:08,380 --> 00:44:09,573
- Goodness. - All right.

1254
00:44:10,610 --> 00:44:12,379
(Sae Rok votes for her as well.)

1255
00:44:12,380 --> 00:44:14,749
- How could you? - Da Gam was...

1256
00:44:14,750 --> 00:44:16,453
quite suspicious today.

1257
00:44:17,119 --> 00:44:18,822
It's easy to see after hearing the hint.

1258
00:44:19,159 --> 00:44:21,566
We have chosen our returning student.

1259
00:44:21,820 --> 00:44:23,186
1, 2, 3.

1260
00:44:23,230 --> 00:44:24,259
- Han Da Gam! - Han Da Gam!

1261
00:44:24,260 --> 00:44:26,959
(The freshmen pick Da Gam.)

1262
00:44:26,960 --> 00:44:29,478
If that person turns out to be the returning student,

1263
00:44:29,670 --> 00:44:31,464
- your prizes will be accumulated. - Yes.

1264
00:44:31,969 --> 00:44:33,499
If you're wrong, your penalties...

1265
00:44:33,500 --> 00:44:34,939
- will be accumulated. - Okay.

1266
00:44:34,940 --> 00:44:39,631
(Will their prizes or penalties be accumulated?)

1267
00:44:40,139 --> 00:44:41,537
That's interesting.

1268
00:44:41,909 --> 00:44:43,709
- Is this foot volleyball? - How interesting.

1269
00:44:43,710 --> 00:44:45,209
- Are there three teams? - It'll be fun.

1270
00:44:45,210 --> 00:44:46,984
This time, we will play with a ball.

1271
00:44:47,480 --> 00:44:48,642
If you win this mission,

1272
00:44:48,920 --> 00:44:50,718
you'll be able to have lunch.

1273
00:44:50,719 --> 00:44:51,888
(Their lunch is at stake.)

1274
00:44:51,889 --> 00:44:53,624
- I'm hungry. - That'll be good.

1275
00:44:53,820 --> 00:44:56,058
- We need to do well. - We definitely should.

1276
00:44:56,059 --> 00:44:57,428
- We need to be serious. - I have to do well.

1277
00:44:57,429 --> 00:44:59,629
- I'm starving. - I'm hungry!

1278
00:44:59,630 --> 00:45:01,799
This is Three Team Gym Ball Foot Volleyball.

1279
00:45:01,800 --> 00:45:02,928
Gym ball?

1280
00:45:02,929 --> 00:45:04,357
- Gym ball? - What is that?

1281
00:45:04,769 --> 00:45:06,096
- Gym ball? - I'm done for.

1282
00:45:06,170 --> 00:45:07,499
- It's that big ball. - Gym ball.

1283
00:45:07,500 --> 00:45:08,768
They have them at the gyms.

1284
00:45:08,769 --> 00:45:10,401
- Gym ball? - Gym ball.

1285
00:45:10,670 --> 00:45:12,516
- Is it possible to play with that? - I'm done for.

1286
00:45:13,340 --> 00:45:15,339
(It won't be easy.)

1287
00:45:15,340 --> 00:45:16,981
You'll be divided 4, 4, and 3.

1288
00:45:17,409 --> 00:45:18,948
There will be three teams.

1289
00:45:18,949 --> 00:45:21,672
You'll all play simultaneously.

1290
00:45:22,349 --> 00:45:25,582
Every time you lose, you'll be deducted one point.

1291
00:45:25,820 --> 00:45:28,135
The team with 10 deduction points will lose.

1292
00:45:29,130 --> 00:45:31,158
- We can scheme against a team. - You're right.

1293
00:45:31,159 --> 00:45:32,259
That's possible.

1294
00:45:32,260 --> 00:45:33,299
The winning team...

1295
00:45:33,300 --> 00:45:34,399
(What will they get?)

1296
00:45:34,400 --> 00:45:35,593
will get pork belly.

1297
00:45:36,269 --> 00:45:37,423
Seriously?

1298
00:45:38,769 --> 00:45:40,698
(It'll be a party.)

1299
00:45:40,699 --> 00:45:42,408
(They'll have pork belly.)

1300
00:45:42,409 --> 00:45:44,038
No way. I'm craving pork belly.

1301
00:45:44,039 --> 00:45:45,879
- I want that fat. - It suits this occasion.

1302
00:45:45,880 --> 00:45:48,286
- It definitely does. - Yes, here in Chuncheon.

1303
00:45:48,510 --> 00:45:50,609
If we do grill them, it'll truly be an orientation.

1304
00:45:50,610 --> 00:45:51,773
The second team to win...

1305
00:45:52,380 --> 00:45:53,448
will have instant noodles.

1306
00:45:53,449 --> 00:45:55,152
That's still good.

1307
00:45:55,320 --> 00:45:57,049
I'd be happy with second place.

1308
00:45:57,050 --> 00:45:58,580
- He loves it. - I like that better.

1309
00:45:58,989 --> 00:46:00,550
- And last place? - The losing team...

1310
00:46:00,960 --> 00:46:02,388
- will have rice and lavers. - Okay.

1311
00:46:02,429 --> 00:46:04,164
- Rice and lavers. - Second place will be fine.

1312
00:46:04,559 --> 00:46:05,886
I'm fine with coming second.

1313
00:46:06,030 --> 00:46:07,359
Jong Kook prefers second or last.

1314
00:46:07,360 --> 00:46:08,553
- I want pork belly. - All right.

1315
00:46:08,760 --> 00:46:11,656
Even for this round, the returning student will be...

1316
00:46:11,900 --> 00:46:14,316
- doing their hidden mission. - Okay.

1317
00:46:14,340 --> 00:46:15,390
- Really? - Watch closely.

1318
00:46:16,010 --> 00:46:19,138
(What is the returning student's mission?)

1319
00:46:19,139 --> 00:46:20,238
It's the person who messes up.

1320
00:46:20,239 --> 00:46:22,908
(He guesses that the student will mess up on purpose.)

1321
00:46:22,909 --> 00:46:26,520
Okay, the returning student's hidden mission for this round...

1322
00:46:26,949 --> 00:46:28,817
- is not getting first place. - Seriously?

1323
00:46:29,320 --> 00:46:30,488
- Who is it? - Who is it?

1324
00:46:30,489 --> 00:46:31,744
(The student will prevent their team from getting 1st place.)

1325
00:46:32,519 --> 00:46:34,558
(The person who repeatedly makes mistakes...)

1326
00:46:34,559 --> 00:46:35,629
(is most likely the returning student.)

1327
00:46:35,630 --> 00:46:37,160
- We need to watch closely. - We do.

1328
00:46:37,260 --> 00:46:38,388
We need to be alert.

1329
00:46:38,389 --> 00:46:39,757
- Maybe it's Da Gam. - It could be Kwang Soo.

1330
00:46:40,530 --> 00:46:42,768
(Is one of them truly the returning student?)

1331
00:46:42,769 --> 00:46:44,268
(Team Sae Rok, Team Jin Young, Team Da Gam)

1332
00:46:44,269 --> 00:46:46,074
- Let's go now. - All right.

1333
00:46:47,369 --> 00:46:48,664
I'm nervous.

1334
00:46:49,409 --> 00:46:50,408
Who will serve?

1335
00:46:50,409 --> 00:46:51,808
- Over there. - Let's focus.

1336
00:46:51,809 --> 00:46:53,716
We'll do it. I'll serve.

1337
00:46:53,980 --> 00:46:55,908
(The match begins.)

1338
00:46:55,909 --> 00:46:56,948
Okay.

1339
00:46:56,949 --> 00:46:58,582
(Kwang Soo serves first.)

1340
00:47:00,880 --> 00:47:02,448
Okay. It's mine.

1341
00:47:02,449 --> 00:47:05,288
(He hits the ball towards Team Sae Rok.)

1342
00:47:05,289 --> 00:47:07,459
(Will they get the first point easily?)

1343
00:47:07,460 --> 00:47:08,859
- Okay. - Okay.

1344
00:47:08,860 --> 00:47:10,257
(It hits the net.)

1345
00:47:10,760 --> 00:47:12,259
What was that?

1346
00:47:12,360 --> 00:47:13,359
(Team Da Gam gets 1 point deducted.)

1347
00:47:13,360 --> 00:47:15,828
- Wait. - What was that?

1348
00:47:15,829 --> 00:47:18,098
- Okay! Good work. - Yes!

1349
00:47:18,099 --> 00:47:21,200
- I'm not used to that ball. - Come on.

1350
00:47:21,300 --> 00:47:22,666
Did we get a deduction?

1351
00:47:22,769 --> 00:47:24,035
We did.

1352
00:47:24,909 --> 00:47:25,979
Really?

1353
00:47:25,980 --> 00:47:26,979
(Se Chan serves.)

1354
00:47:26,980 --> 00:47:28,000
It's mine.

1355
00:47:28,840 --> 00:47:29,930
It's mine.

1356
00:47:30,050 --> 00:47:32,365
(Hitting)

1357
00:47:33,619 --> 00:47:34,819
(It hits his stomach.)

1358
00:47:34,820 --> 00:47:36,075
He's out.

1359
00:47:36,550 --> 00:47:38,121
That was very suspicious.

1360
00:47:38,389 --> 00:47:40,058
- That's not right. - Come on.

1361
00:47:40,059 --> 00:47:41,558
Wasn't that weird?

1362
00:47:41,559 --> 00:47:43,089
(He makes two mistakes in a row.)

1363
00:47:43,090 --> 00:47:44,328
- Hold on. - He's the returning student.

1364
00:47:44,329 --> 00:47:46,198
- Look, Bo Gae. - Is it really you?

1365
00:47:46,199 --> 00:47:47,299
- Isn't it him? - What?

1366
00:47:47,300 --> 00:47:48,328
- What's wrong with you? - The ball is hard to control.

1367
00:47:48,329 --> 00:47:49,868
- Are you serious? - It's hard.

1368
00:47:49,869 --> 00:47:50,999
It's hard to control it.

1369
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:52,669
- It's because of the ball. - This isn't right.

1370
00:47:52,670 --> 00:47:54,066
It's too hard to predict.

1371
00:47:54,199 --> 00:47:55,740
This makes no sense.

1372
00:47:56,210 --> 00:47:57,968
- This is... - We'll have to keep an eye on him.

1373
00:47:57,969 --> 00:47:59,643
- Wait. - Let's focus.

1374
00:48:00,309 --> 00:48:01,808
Do you want to try, Jin Young?

1375
00:48:01,809 --> 00:48:03,408
(Team Da Gam has two deduction points.)

1376
00:48:03,409 --> 00:48:04,704
- Do you want to try? - No, you can.

1377
00:48:06,349 --> 00:48:07,471
What are you two doing?

1378
00:48:08,519 --> 00:48:10,149
You're getting along well.

1379
00:48:10,150 --> 00:48:12,536
Hold on. This is that American couple.

1380
00:48:13,090 --> 00:48:15,710
- American couple? - That team's a bit weird.

1381
00:48:16,559 --> 00:48:18,466
The ladies are related to him.

1382
00:48:19,199 --> 00:48:20,529
- Oh, shush! - Let's go.

1383
00:48:20,530 --> 00:48:21,729
(They should keep it down.)

1384
00:48:21,730 --> 00:48:23,097
Focus.

1385
00:48:24,170 --> 00:48:25,638
(I'm on Ji Hyo's side.)

1386
00:48:25,639 --> 00:48:26,966
- Focus. - Focus.

1387
00:48:27,139 --> 00:48:28,496
- Focus. - Okay.

1388
00:48:28,800 --> 00:48:31,217
(Jong Kook kicks the ball to Kwang Soo.)

1389
00:48:32,139 --> 00:48:33,308
- Focus. - Okay.

1390
00:48:33,309 --> 00:48:34,308
Do a heading.

1391
00:48:34,309 --> 00:48:37,045
(If he fails once again, he'll be suspected for sure.)

1392
00:48:37,189 --> 00:48:38,416
- Focus. - Focus.

1393
00:48:38,489 --> 00:48:39,846
- Focus. - Okay.

1394
00:48:40,150 --> 00:48:42,567
(Jong Kook kicks the ball to Kwang Soo.)

1395
00:48:43,489 --> 00:48:44,658
- Focus. - Okay.

1396
00:48:44,659 --> 00:48:45,658
Do a heading.

1397
00:48:45,659 --> 00:48:46,999
(Will he be able to counterattack this time?)

1398
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:50,329
(It hits his head.)

1399
00:48:50,330 --> 00:48:51,428
- Hey! - Okay!

1400
00:48:51,429 --> 00:48:53,133
(The ball goes out.)

1401
00:48:53,330 --> 00:48:54,838
Do a heading. Hey!

1402
00:48:54,839 --> 00:48:56,468
(The other team would've lost had he not touched it.)

1403
00:48:56,469 --> 00:48:57,999
It touched his head.

1404
00:48:58,040 --> 00:48:59,609
- It's out. - It was out.

1405
00:48:59,610 --> 00:49:00,838
You should've been at the back.

1406
00:49:00,839 --> 00:49:03,579
- What were you doing? - I swear, the sun was blinding me.

1407
00:49:03,580 --> 00:49:05,793
- Seriously. - I swear.

1408
00:49:06,080 --> 00:49:08,088
- It was the sun. - Whatever.

1409
00:49:08,580 --> 00:49:10,078
- Okay. - Here we go.

1410
00:49:10,520 --> 00:49:11,570
Okay!

1411
00:49:13,089 --> 00:49:14,118
Good.

1412
00:49:14,119 --> 00:49:16,258
(Haha serves to Jin Young.)

1413
00:49:16,259 --> 00:49:17,616
- Good. - Get it.

1414
00:49:18,489 --> 00:49:21,458
(Jin Young unstably receives it.)

1415
00:49:22,299 --> 00:49:23,559
Kick it over. Good!

1416
00:49:23,560 --> 00:49:24,629
(Jong Kook had quick reflexes.)

1417
00:49:24,630 --> 00:49:25,691
Do a heading.

1418
00:49:26,369 --> 00:49:29,269
(The ball flies towards Kwang Soo.)

1419
00:49:29,270 --> 00:49:30,638
(Heading)

1420
00:49:30,639 --> 00:49:31,638
(It hits his face.)

1421
00:49:31,639 --> 00:49:32,761
Heading. Good.

1422
00:49:33,639 --> 00:49:34,638
(He defends with his face.)

1423
00:49:34,639 --> 00:49:36,579
- Get it. - It went out!

1424
00:49:36,580 --> 00:49:38,548
(It hits Jong Kook's foot and goes out.)

1425
00:49:38,909 --> 00:49:40,685
- It went out! - Okay!

1426
00:49:40,850 --> 00:49:42,419
(Even Jong Kook couldn't counterattack Kwang Soo's shot.)

1427
00:49:42,420 --> 00:49:44,153
- Okay. - They are doing nothing.

1428
00:49:44,989 --> 00:49:46,173
I know.

1429
00:49:46,319 --> 00:49:48,808
I thought it was out. It's longer than I thought.

1430
00:49:49,259 --> 00:49:50,452
The field is quite big.

1431
00:49:51,790 --> 00:49:54,206
I saw the infamous heading face of Kwang Soo's.

1432
00:49:55,130 --> 00:49:57,829
(His heading face...)

1433
00:49:57,830 --> 00:49:59,099
(is patented.)

1434
00:49:59,100 --> 00:50:01,894
(It's the face of a sad angel.)

1435
00:50:01,900 --> 00:50:03,138
All right.

1436
00:50:03,139 --> 00:50:04,434
(Team Da Gam: minus 3, Team Jin Young: minus 1)

1437
00:50:05,969 --> 00:50:06,968
(Haha serves.)

1438
00:50:06,969 --> 00:50:08,338
- It's mine. - It's mine.

1439
00:50:08,339 --> 00:50:09,638
(The ball flies towards the team with the least points.)

1440
00:50:09,639 --> 00:50:11,007
- Okay. Nice! - Good.

1441
00:50:12,350 --> 00:50:13,379
Good.

1442
00:50:13,380 --> 00:50:14,979
(Flustered, Haha kicks it towards Team Jin Young.)

1443
00:50:14,980 --> 00:50:17,469
It's okay. Darn it.

1444
00:50:18,319 --> 00:50:20,658
(The ball lands at an ambiguous spot.)

1445
00:50:20,659 --> 00:50:22,318
Sorry. I should've kicked it harder.

1446
00:50:22,319 --> 00:50:23,717
- Okay. - Okay.

1447
00:50:24,130 --> 00:50:25,528
- Good. - Hold on.

1448
00:50:25,529 --> 00:50:27,399
Why couldn't he kick it?

1449
00:50:27,400 --> 00:50:30,082
(She catches onto something.)

1450
00:50:30,230 --> 00:50:31,229
What?

1451
00:50:31,230 --> 00:50:32,760
Have you ever seen him fail to kick a ball?

1452
00:50:33,100 --> 00:50:34,169
- I know. - That's weird.

1453
00:50:34,170 --> 00:50:35,968
This wasn't that long of a distance.

1454
00:50:35,969 --> 00:50:38,591
Normally, he would've kicked it over.

1455
00:50:38,670 --> 00:50:40,372
- He couldn't do it? - It's not me.

1456
00:50:40,839 --> 00:50:43,008
- It's not me. It was a mistake. - He couldn't...

1457
00:50:43,009 --> 00:50:44,846
- kick it over? - It was my mistake.

1458
00:50:45,250 --> 00:50:46,408
Let's win this game.

1459
00:50:46,409 --> 00:50:47,818
(We'll see if it was a mistake or not.)

1460
00:50:47,819 --> 00:50:49,479
- I'll serve it. - He's odd.

1461
00:50:49,480 --> 00:50:51,189
(Was it truly a mistake?)

1462
00:50:51,190 --> 00:50:52,240
All right.

1463
00:50:52,290 --> 00:50:53,419
- Okay. - It'll come this way.

1464
00:50:53,420 --> 00:50:54,488
Get ready.

1465
00:50:54,489 --> 00:50:55,611
(Team Da Gam: minus 3, Team Jin Young: minus 2)

1466
00:50:56,819 --> 00:50:58,696
Good.

1467
00:50:59,130 --> 00:51:00,528
It's in. Good.

1468
00:51:00,529 --> 00:51:03,661
(The ball flies towards Jong Kook who just made a mistake.)

1469
00:51:04,130 --> 00:51:05,129
(He fails to kick it over.)

1470
00:51:05,130 --> 00:51:06,252
He's weird.

1471
00:51:06,730 --> 00:51:07,994
It's in. Good.

1472
00:51:08,299 --> 00:51:09,492
He's weird.

1473
00:51:10,400 --> 00:51:12,138
Hold on. Isn't he suspicious?

1474
00:51:12,139 --> 00:51:13,363
(He made two mistakes in a row.)

1475
00:51:13,540 --> 00:51:15,580
- That's a bit odd. - Why are you so bad?

1476
00:51:15,610 --> 00:51:16,939
That seemed intentional.

1477
00:51:16,940 --> 00:51:18,709
- It doesn't make any sense. - That was suspicious.

1478
00:51:18,710 --> 00:51:20,109
- Come on. - That's really weird.

1479
00:51:20,110 --> 00:51:21,446
You're suspicious.

1480
00:51:21,650 --> 00:51:23,579
Hear me out. I thought it was out.

1481
00:51:23,580 --> 00:51:25,519
- No, come here. - I thought it was out.

1482
00:51:25,520 --> 00:51:27,258
- No. - But it turned out I was wrong.

1483
00:51:27,259 --> 00:51:29,258
- You're making an excuse. - I thought it was out.

1484
00:51:29,489 --> 00:51:32,059
- He's suspicious. - If he thought it was out,

1485
00:51:32,060 --> 00:51:33,998
- he wouldn't have received it. - You're right.

1486
00:51:34,199 --> 00:51:35,761
I'm serious. It's not me.

1487
00:51:36,460 --> 00:51:37,521
It isn't me.

1488
00:51:39,330 --> 00:51:41,379
Bo Gae in this team and Jong Kook in that team.

1489
00:51:41,900 --> 00:51:43,908
Bo Gae is suspicious.

1490
00:51:43,940 --> 00:51:45,643
You're right. He's weird too.

1491
00:51:45,770 --> 00:51:47,408
All right. You can serve it.

1492
00:51:47,409 --> 00:51:49,348
- He's weird. - Let's go.

1493
00:51:49,940 --> 00:51:50,948
It's here.

1494
00:51:50,949 --> 00:51:52,008
(Haha's serve goes to suspicious Jong Kook.)

1495
00:51:52,009 --> 00:51:53,309
- Kick it. - Okay.

1496
00:51:53,310 --> 00:51:54,919
- Good. Nice. - Okay.

1497
00:51:54,920 --> 00:51:57,588
- Good. Go, Sae Rok. - Nice.

1498
00:51:57,589 --> 00:51:58,742
(Sae Rok counterattacks with a heading.)

1499
00:51:58,889 --> 00:52:00,318
Good job, Sae Rok.

1500
00:52:00,319 --> 00:52:02,218
(Jong Kook successfully kicks over the ball.)

1501
00:52:02,219 --> 00:52:03,995
- Nice, Jong Kook. - Head it!

1502
00:52:04,460 --> 00:52:05,729
(The ball flies.)

1503
00:52:05,730 --> 00:52:07,330
- Okay! - Okay!

1504
00:52:07,500 --> 00:52:09,729
(She flinches and moves away from the ball.)

1505
00:52:09,730 --> 00:52:11,463
- It didn't reach my head. - Wait.

1506
00:52:11,770 --> 00:52:14,115
Is it Da Gam? Why isn't she doing anything?

1507
00:52:14,400 --> 00:52:16,439
- She hasn't been doing anything. - She moved away from the ball.

1508
00:52:16,440 --> 00:52:18,539
- The ball didn't come to me. - She dodged the ball.

1509
00:52:18,540 --> 00:52:20,141
- I saw it. - Hey.

1510
00:52:20,440 --> 00:52:22,958
- Are you performing the mission? - No, the ball wasn't coming to me.

1511
00:52:24,179 --> 00:52:26,309
(She pretended to move towards the ball...)

1512
00:52:26,310 --> 00:52:28,767
(but didn't even reach out and rather avoided it.)

1513
00:52:29,549 --> 00:52:30,977
She moved away.

1514
00:52:31,089 --> 00:52:32,885
- I think it's her. - She dodged the ball.

1515
00:52:32,949 --> 00:52:35,019
One of us is currently performing their mission.

1516
00:52:35,020 --> 00:52:36,591
You're right. We need to keep an eye out.

1517
00:52:36,659 --> 00:52:39,343
- We need to toss it to everyone. - You're right.

1518
00:52:40,389 --> 00:52:43,011
- We need to observe all of them. - Da Gam is suspicious.

1519
00:52:44,369 --> 00:52:45,960
- Which way should I kick it? - Over there.

1520
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:47,193
- Over there? - Yes.

1521
00:52:48,299 --> 00:52:49,298
(Jae Seok serves.)

1522
00:52:49,299 --> 00:52:50,399
Get it!

1523
00:52:50,400 --> 00:52:53,539
(The ball flies to Da Gam.)

1524
00:52:53,540 --> 00:52:54,661
- Get it! - Go!

1525
00:52:56,739 --> 00:52:57,908
Okay.

1526
00:52:57,909 --> 00:52:59,379
- Get it! - Go!

1527
00:53:00,679 --> 00:53:02,249
(She keeps making mistakes.)

1528
00:53:02,250 --> 00:53:03,678
Are you being intentional?

1529
00:53:03,679 --> 00:53:05,019
- You're acting so strange. - It's her.

1530
00:53:05,020 --> 00:53:06,019
- What was that? - It's not me.

1531
00:53:06,020 --> 00:53:07,359
- Were you being intentional? - You're acting weird.

1532
00:53:07,360 --> 00:53:08,618
It's not me.

1533
00:53:08,619 --> 00:53:10,419
- Then you should serve. - Try it.

1534
00:53:10,420 --> 00:53:11,481
Gosh.

1535
00:53:11,630 --> 00:53:13,016
We'll know for sure this time.

1536
00:53:13,560 --> 00:53:15,359
- Something's fishy. - I think...

1537
00:53:15,360 --> 00:53:17,329
Doesn't she seem like the returning student?

1538
00:53:17,330 --> 00:53:19,104
(Another mistake, and everyone will suspect her even more.)

1539
00:53:20,429 --> 00:53:21,460
- Okay! - Good work.

1540
00:53:22,469 --> 00:53:23,908
(She lightly kicks it.)

1541
00:53:23,909 --> 00:53:24,939
It's out.

1542
00:53:24,940 --> 00:53:25,939
- Out. - It's out.

1543
00:53:25,940 --> 00:53:27,877
(The ball is out.)

1544
00:53:28,980 --> 00:53:30,749
Da Gam is very suspicious.

1545
00:53:30,750 --> 00:53:31,879
(She fails at serving the ball.)

1546
00:53:31,880 --> 00:53:34,718
- She's so weird. - Don't you think it's her?

1547
00:53:34,719 --> 00:53:36,413
(Thanks to her, they lose a total of 3 points.)

1548
00:53:36,779 --> 00:53:38,625
Let's beat them.

1549
00:53:39,549 --> 00:53:40,569
It's mine.

1550
00:53:41,089 --> 00:53:43,318
(4 more losses in points, and Team Da Gam will lose.)

1551
00:53:43,319 --> 00:53:44,729
Good, good.

1552
00:53:44,730 --> 00:53:45,985
(They need to be encouraged.)

1553
00:53:46,529 --> 00:53:48,129
(Da Gam compliments her teammates.)

1554
00:53:48,130 --> 00:53:49,150
Get it over the net.

1555
00:53:50,199 --> 00:53:51,468
- So Min! - Good.

1556
00:53:51,469 --> 00:53:52,489
Get it.

1557
00:53:53,869 --> 00:53:56,269
(The ball descends towards Da Gam's head.)

1558
00:53:56,270 --> 00:53:59,431
(Did she just catch it with her hand?)

1559
00:54:00,069 --> 00:54:04,334
(This time, she fails by playing with her hand.)

1561
00:54:07,949 --> 00:54:09,786
Hey, they have...

1562
00:54:09,850 --> 00:54:11,348
two returning students.

1563
00:54:11,549 --> 00:54:14,477
That side is full of returning students.

1564
00:54:15,089 --> 00:54:16,919
It's chaotic.

1565
00:54:16,920 --> 00:54:18,428
- It's a mess. - I'm so upset.

1566
00:54:18,429 --> 00:54:20,776
- Hey! - I'm certain!

1567
00:54:20,799 --> 00:54:23,359
- Da Gam, are you the one? - Yes?

1568
00:54:23,360 --> 00:54:25,868
- I was just scared of the ball. - Is that so?

1569
00:54:25,869 --> 00:54:27,669
- Yes. - Don't lie.

1570
00:54:27,670 --> 00:54:28,798
(Everyone has been suspecting her since the previous games.)

1571
00:54:28,799 --> 00:54:30,370
I'm scared of the ball.

1572
00:54:32,170 --> 00:54:34,908
(Are these two making mistakes intentionally?)

1573
00:54:34,909 --> 00:54:37,154
We need to find the returning student.

1574
00:54:38,509 --> 00:54:40,039
- Kick it. - Okay.

1575
00:54:40,080 --> 00:54:41,618
- It's out. - It's out.

1576
00:54:41,619 --> 00:54:43,385
- It's out. - Hey!

1577
00:54:44,049 --> 00:54:45,069
Let's go.

1578
00:54:45,549 --> 00:54:46,749

00:54:47,759 --> 00:54:49,494
(This time, it's Da Gam's turn to fail.)

1581
00:54:49,759 --> 00:54:51,524
- What did she just do? - Gosh, Da Gam.

1582
00:54:51,560 --> 00:54:52,783
She received it with her bottom.

1583
00:54:53,259 --> 00:54:54,959
She received it with her bottom.

1584
00:54:54,960 --> 00:54:56,298
Get it. Okay.

1585
00:54:56,299 --> 00:54:58,747
- Seok Jin! - I'll do it!

1586
00:54:59,330 --> 00:55:00,329
Okay!

1587
00:55:00,330 --> 00:55:02,198
(Thanks to the candidates, they lose.)

1588
00:55:02,199 --> 00:55:03,219
It's over.

1589
00:55:03,339 --> 00:55:04,737
- Okay. - Okay.

1590
00:55:06,770 --> 00:55:07,838
I'm so frustrated.

1591
00:55:07,839 --> 00:55:10,039
(Are these two returning students?)

1592
00:55:10,040 --> 00:55:11,172
Their team doesn't exist anymore, right?

1593
00:55:11,610 --> 00:55:13,344
- It's against the two teams. - We don't exist anymore.

1594
00:55:14,119 --> 00:55:15,609
We'll at least get instant noodles.

1595
00:55:16,279 --> 00:55:17,749
(For the finals, the winner needs to get 3 points.)

1596
00:55:17,750 --> 00:55:18,770
Serve it.

1597
00:55:19,290 --> 00:55:21,588
We should kick it towards those who are suspicious...

1598
00:55:21,589 --> 00:55:23,762
so we can observe their actions.

1599
00:55:24,159 --> 00:55:25,823
We need to observe them.

1600
00:55:26,429 --> 00:55:27,449
Okay.

1601
00:55:28,630 --> 00:55:29,829
(Jin Young serves.)

1602
00:55:29,830 --> 00:55:32,991
- Good. That was good. - Nice.

1603
00:55:33,100 --> 00:55:34,904
- I'm sorry! - Nice!

1604
00:55:36,270 --> 00:55:37,320
I'm sorry!

1605
00:55:38,110 --> 00:55:39,262
That makes no sense.

1606
00:55:40,069 --> 00:55:41,233
That's suspicious.

1607
00:55:41,679 --> 00:55:44,403
- I'm serious. I swear. - That was good.

1608
00:55:45,650 --> 00:55:47,109
I really swear.

1609
00:55:48,520 --> 00:55:49,519
(Team Jin Young: 0, Team Sae Rok: minus 1)

1610
00:55:49,520 --> 00:55:50,678
- That's right. - It's working.

1611
00:55:50,679 --> 00:55:52,933
Ji Hyo, hold on. Hurry.

1612
00:55:53,319 --> 00:55:54,588
Nice one.

1613
00:55:54,589 --> 00:55:56,459
(The ball that ace player Ji Hyo kicked...)

1614
00:55:56,460 --> 00:55:59,285
(goes to Haha once again.)

1615
00:55:59,429 --> 00:56:01,099
- Hold on. - It's out.

1616
00:56:01,100 --> 00:56:02,258
(His kicking skills fail.)

1617
00:56:02,259 --> 00:56:03,687
Okay. Nice one.

1618
00:56:04,270 --> 00:56:05,320
That's weird.

1619
00:56:05,770 --> 00:56:07,468
Haha, it's the second time in a row.

1620
00:56:07,469 --> 00:56:09,468
- It is weird. - That's quite strange.

1621
00:56:09,469 --> 00:56:11,653
No, it's really not. I'm sorry.

1622
00:56:12,009 --> 00:56:13,571
It's weird. I think it's a mission.

1623
00:56:14,110 --> 00:56:15,979
- This is driving me crazy. - You're usually good at acting.

1624
00:56:15,980 --> 00:56:18,223
He adapts to it well like that.

1625
00:56:18,250 --> 00:56:20,627
- We only have a point left. - We're in trouble.

1626
00:56:21,319 --> 00:56:23,048
We can do it. We can win this.

1627
00:56:23,049 --> 00:56:24,752
- Then you should do well. - Okay.

1628
00:56:25,819 --> 00:56:26,839
Okay, let's do this.

1629
00:56:28,060 --> 00:56:29,110
Nice one.

1630
00:56:29,319 --> 00:56:31,559
We should send it over to the candidate...

1631
00:56:31,560 --> 00:56:33,773
and see if that person is acting suspiciously.

1632
00:56:34,199 --> 00:56:35,829
We need to see if they're acting weird.

1633
00:56:35,830 --> 00:56:37,499
(The ball goes to Haha for the third time.)

1634
00:56:37,500 --> 00:56:39,129
(Will he receive it well this time?)

1635
00:56:39,130 --> 00:56:40,169
Oh, no.

1636
00:56:40,170 --> 00:56:41,238
(Bounces off)

1637
00:56:41,239 --> 00:56:42,669
Out. It's done.

1638
00:56:42,670 --> 00:56:44,302
(It goes out straight away.)

1639
00:56:44,839 --> 00:56:46,269
- Gosh. - Hey, you're the returning student.

1640
00:56:46,270 --> 00:56:47,579
- The returning student. - I'm really not.

1641
00:56:47,580 --> 00:56:49,879
- Why would I lose? - I can see that he is one now.

1642
00:56:49,880 --> 00:56:51,349
I'm telling you the truth.

1643
00:56:51,350 --> 00:56:53,678
- He's being weird. - Trust me.

1644
00:56:53,679 --> 00:56:55,349
No, listen to us.

1645
00:56:55,350 --> 00:56:57,634
He seemed suspicious, so we passed the ball to him a number of times.

1646
00:56:57,719 --> 00:56:58,888
He failed to receive them all.

1647
00:56:58,889 --> 00:57:01,409
It's hard to fail while heading.

1648
00:57:01,420 --> 00:57:02,918
Haha is being weird.

1649
00:57:03,420 --> 00:57:05,629
- No, it's because I closed my eyes. - He gave up.

1650
00:57:05,630 --> 00:57:07,899
We passed it to him a couple of times but...

1651
00:57:07,900 --> 00:57:10,559
- It seems like... - I honestly tried my best.

1652
00:57:10,560 --> 00:57:11,568
I tried my best.

1653
00:57:11,569 --> 00:57:14,539
- But this is... - They are even weirder than me.

1654
00:57:14,540 --> 00:57:16,698
In this group, Jong Kook is weird.

1655
00:57:16,699 --> 00:57:18,568
- Here, it's Da Gam. - It's Da Gam over here.

1656
00:57:18,569 --> 00:57:20,939
- Kwang Soo. - Kwang Soo and Da Gam.

1657
00:57:20,940 --> 00:57:22,948
This place is filled with returning students.

1658
00:57:24,949 --> 00:57:26,609
This really feels like an orientation.

1659
00:57:26,610 --> 00:57:28,718
- That looks delicious. - The sausage looks delicious.

1660
00:57:28,719 --> 00:57:30,861
They're cooking well. Look at the sausage.

1661
00:57:31,319 --> 00:57:32,371
Look at this.

1662
00:57:32,889 --> 00:57:35,031
I can smell it from here.

1663
00:57:35,060 --> 00:57:36,218
- It's here. - That looks delicious.

1664
00:57:36,219 --> 00:57:37,419
The sausage is ready.

1665
00:57:37,420 --> 00:57:38,715
(Cooling it before eating it.)

1666
00:57:39,589 --> 00:57:41,359
Yes, it's ready.

1667
00:57:41,360 --> 00:57:43,135
(2nd place will have an instant noodles party.)

1668
00:57:44,400 --> 00:57:45,928
(We could've eaten it if we didn't make a mistake.)

1669
00:57:45,929 --> 00:57:47,358
I can't hold it in anymore.

1670
00:57:48,299 --> 00:57:49,360
It's so good, right?

1671
00:57:50,199 --> 00:57:51,968
My team, let's not be like this.

1672
00:57:51,969 --> 00:57:55,173
- We look like losers. - This is all Da Gam's fault.

1673
00:57:55,339 --> 00:57:56,479
Why is it my fault?

1674
00:57:56,480 --> 00:57:59,233
Da Gam is the returning student. That's why we lost.

1675
00:57:59,310 --> 00:58:00,349
That's true.

1676
00:58:00,350 --> 00:58:02,278
(While Da Gam is being suspected for being the returning student.)

1677
00:58:02,279 --> 00:58:04,330
Let's find the returning student quickly.

1678
00:58:04,619 --> 00:58:06,221
Please turn yourselves in.

1679
00:58:06,350 --> 00:58:08,189
- No. - It's Da Gam.

1680
00:58:08,190 --> 00:58:11,428
It's been decided who the returning student is.

1681
00:58:11,429 --> 00:58:13,806
- Who is it? - We roughly know now.

1682
00:58:13,830 --> 00:58:16,788
It's Da Gam and Haha.

1683
00:58:17,060 --> 00:58:18,769
- Haha? - I'm really not.

1684
00:58:18,770 --> 00:58:20,871
- Jong Kook. - I really did my best.

1685
00:58:21,139 --> 00:58:23,269
- These are the suspicious members. - I really worked hard...

1686
00:58:23,270 --> 00:58:25,408
- for my team. - Haha did seem suspicious.

1687
00:58:25,409 --> 00:58:26,609
It's weird. He seems weird too.

1688
00:58:26,610 --> 00:58:28,210
In the second round,

1689
00:58:28,239 --> 00:58:29,738
the returning student's mission was...

1690
00:58:29,739 --> 00:58:31,107
(The returning student's mission in the last foot volleyball game.)

1691
00:58:31,949 --> 00:58:35,959
(To not place 1st in the game.)

1692
00:58:36,779 --> 00:58:38,349
(Who will it be?)

1693
00:58:38,350 --> 00:58:41,042
Wait. You need to tell us if they succeeded or not.

1694
00:58:41,060 --> 00:58:42,242
Yes, we need to hear that first.

1695
00:58:42,290 --> 00:58:44,988
The returning student...

1696
00:58:44,989 --> 00:58:47,859
(If they placed 1st, they failed. If they didn't, they succeeded.)

1697
00:58:47,860 --> 00:58:49,698
- did succeed. - That's right.

1698
00:58:49,699 --> 00:58:51,399
(The returning student's mission was successful.)

1699
00:58:51,400 --> 00:58:53,669
- Who placed first? - Did you really suspect me?

1700
00:58:53,670 --> 00:58:55,298
- Did you really suspect me? - Good job.

1701
00:58:55,299 --> 00:58:57,298
Jong Kook, Se Chan, Jin Young, and Ji Hyo...

1702
00:58:57,299 --> 00:58:59,207
- aren't the returning student. - It's Da Gam, Haha,

1703
00:58:59,440 --> 00:59:02,238
- and Lee Kwang Soo. - It's not me. I worked hard.

1704
00:59:02,239 --> 00:59:04,008
I think Kwang Soo is the most...

1705
00:59:04,009 --> 00:59:05,948
Yes, Kwang Soo was acting strange too.

1706
00:59:05,949 --> 00:59:07,079
- Kwang Soo? - He was being unblievable.

1707
00:59:07,080 --> 00:59:08,678
- Kwang Soo was weird. - It's not me.

1708
00:59:08,679 --> 00:59:10,079
- We were on the same team. - Kwang Soo...

1709
00:59:10,080 --> 00:59:12,988
- Are you all suspecting me again? - He was weird.

1710
00:59:12,989 --> 00:59:14,559
- Is it you, Kwang Soo? - It's really not me.

1711
00:59:14,560 --> 00:59:17,650
Everyone, to check off this round's returning student,

1712
00:59:17,860 --> 00:59:21,022
you need to avoid one member who is being suspected...

1713
00:59:21,029 --> 00:59:23,899
as the returning student and get into pairs.

1714
00:59:23,900 --> 00:59:27,169
(The rest of the members need to form a pair.)

1715
00:59:27,170 --> 00:59:29,139
- You can't pair up with them. - That's right.

1716
00:59:29,670 --> 00:59:32,238
- The four of us are safe. - We are safe.

1717
00:59:32,239 --> 00:59:34,320
You'll be doing the last round together...

1718
00:59:34,440 --> 00:59:38,048
- as a pair you choose to be. - Really?

1719
00:59:38,049 --> 00:59:41,039
The pair assignment is very important.

1720
00:59:41,080 --> 00:59:43,120
Honestly, Da Gam was the weirdest.

1721
00:59:43,449 --> 00:59:45,189
(Da Gam was the weirdest.)

1722
00:59:45,190 --> 00:59:47,548
- Honestly, Da Gam was the weirdest. - Da Gam really was.

1723
00:59:47,549 --> 00:59:50,359
- Da Gam was very strange. - She wasn't taking part.

1724
00:59:50,360 --> 00:59:52,189
- Ji Hyo... - Ji Hyo and Jin Young...

1725
00:59:52,190 --> 00:59:53,761
- are both safe. - We need to pair with them.

1726
00:59:53,790 --> 00:59:56,129
- I need to avoid Da Gam. - Ji Hyo and Jin Young.

1727
00:59:56,130 --> 00:59:58,528
- Se Chan, you can go first. - Am I first?

1728
00:59:58,529 --> 01:00:00,428
I guess I'll have to choose...

1729
01:00:00,429 --> 01:00:02,169
You need to choose someone who isn't the returning student.

1730
01:00:02,170 --> 01:00:03,362
He's a safe one.

1731
01:00:03,670 --> 01:00:05,780
I will choose...

1732
01:00:06,469 --> 01:00:07,561
Jin Young.

1733
01:00:08,279 --> 01:00:10,309
(Se Chan and Jin Young)

1734
01:00:10,310 --> 01:00:11,309
Sure.

1735
01:00:11,310 --> 01:00:12,579
(Confirmed)

1736
01:00:12,580 --> 01:00:15,843
(Se Chan and Jin Young form a pair.)

1737
01:00:16,319 --> 01:00:17,339
For me,

1738
01:00:18,020 --> 01:00:19,785
if you get rejected, you have to go last.

1739
01:00:19,819 --> 01:00:21,012
That's dangerous.

1740
01:00:21,790 --> 01:00:23,959
You should see that Jae Seok is also pretending to be...

1741
01:00:23,960 --> 01:00:25,289
- the class leader. - He's being weird too.

1742
01:00:25,290 --> 01:00:27,228
- He's being too passive. - Everyone.

1743
01:00:27,389 --> 01:00:29,359
Ji Hyo is certainly safe.

1744
01:00:29,360 --> 01:00:30,428
- You're right. - Yes, I'm certain.

1745
01:00:30,429 --> 01:00:31,568
- Ji Hyo. - Pass.

1746
01:00:31,569 --> 01:00:33,405
(Suspicious Jae Seok reaches out but is rejected by Ji Hyo.)

1747
01:00:33,500 --> 01:00:35,068
(You're rejected.)

1748
01:00:35,069 --> 01:00:37,138
You're last now.

1749
01:00:37,139 --> 01:00:39,138
- Hey, I'm... - Go to the back of the line.

1750
01:00:39,139 --> 01:00:40,169
- Hey. - Go back.

1751
01:00:40,170 --> 01:00:41,260
This is so unfair.

1752
01:00:43,080 --> 01:00:44,131
- Who's third? - Me.

1753
01:00:44,880 --> 01:00:46,582
- He's going to Ji Hyo. - Will they meet again?

1754
01:00:46,850 --> 01:00:48,948
(Jong Kook is obviously...)

1755
01:00:48,949 --> 01:00:50,618
(going to her.)

1756
01:00:50,619 --> 01:00:51,618
Honey.

1757
01:00:51,619 --> 01:00:54,919
(Honey, Jong Kook who's safe is here.)

1758
01:00:54,920 --> 01:00:56,019
(Jong Kook and Ji Hyo)

1759
01:00:56,020 --> 01:00:57,158
- Honey, let's go. - Okay.

1760
01:00:57,159 --> 01:01:00,118
(Ji Hyo accepts Jong Kook jauntily.)

1761
01:01:00,330 --> 01:01:01,625
I'm speechless.

1762
01:01:01,960 --> 01:01:03,428
- What? - You guys look good together.

1763
01:01:03,429 --> 01:01:04,729
- I'm speechless. - It's because...

1764
01:01:04,730 --> 01:01:06,368
- it's certain that he's safe. - It's certain. You can't do much.

1765
01:01:06,369 --> 01:01:07,899
- He's certainly safe. - My turn.

1766
01:01:08,500 --> 01:01:09,499
I'll choose you, So Min.

1767
01:01:09,500 --> 01:01:11,539
(Haha who's suspicious goes next.)

1768
01:01:11,540 --> 01:01:13,243
Haha is too suspicious though.

1769
01:01:14,009 --> 01:01:15,814
- Gosh. - She's...

1770
01:01:15,880 --> 01:01:17,809
- So Min is weird too. - Yes, I find So Min weird too.

1771
01:01:17,810 --> 01:01:19,579
- So Min is weird. - Sae Rok, trust me.

1772
01:01:19,580 --> 01:01:21,548
(I only have you, Sae Rok.)

1773
01:01:21,549 --> 01:01:22,548
Yes?

1774
01:01:22,549 --> 01:01:24,888
(Haha and Sae Rok)

1775
01:01:24,889 --> 01:01:26,144
- Sure. - Yes.

1776
01:01:26,719 --> 01:01:29,289
(Suspicious Haha and less suspicious Sae Rok form a pair.)

1777
01:01:29,290 --> 01:01:30,718
- But he's weird. - I knew it.

1778
01:01:31,360 --> 01:01:33,502
- At this rate, Da Gam will be left. - Gosh.

1779
01:01:33,630 --> 01:01:35,428
They're both weird.

1780
01:01:35,429 --> 01:01:37,368
If I avoid Da Gam, So Min is left.

1781
01:01:38,069 --> 01:01:39,868
If I avoid So Min, Da Gam is left.

1782
01:01:39,869 --> 01:01:41,298
So Min is a better choice though.

1783
01:01:41,299 --> 01:01:42,868
They're feeling the same way.

1784
01:01:42,869 --> 01:01:44,808
They might be feeling the same way.

1785
01:01:45,610 --> 01:01:46,769
Why?

1786
01:01:46,770 --> 01:01:48,309
(Who will Seok Jin choose as his pair?)

1787
01:01:48,310 --> 01:01:49,579
- Da Gam. - What?

1788
01:01:49,580 --> 01:01:50,600
Wait for the next person.

1789
01:01:51,350 --> 01:01:52,609
I'm sorry.

1790
01:01:52,610 --> 01:01:53,732
- Goodbye. - Okay.

1791
01:01:54,480 --> 01:01:56,278
(His worry was meaningless.)

1792
01:01:56,279 --> 01:01:58,189
- I'm sorry. - She said sorry.

1793
01:01:58,190 --> 01:01:59,617
She said sorry.

1794
01:01:59,819 --> 01:02:01,689
She apologized to Seok Jin.

1795
01:02:01,690 --> 01:02:02,689
(Rejected Seok Jin goes to the back.)

1796
01:02:02,690 --> 01:02:03,818
- I'm going to let it pass. - I'm sorry.

1797
01:02:03,819 --> 01:02:06,129
- It's not my first time. - I'm sorry.

1798
01:02:06,130 --> 01:02:09,087
- Kwang Soo has a chance now. - Kwang Soo.

1799
01:02:09,159 --> 01:02:11,037
- Wait. - Kwang Soo.

1800
01:02:11,100 --> 01:02:13,568
- He's suspicious. - Returning students should pair up.

1801
01:02:13,569 --> 01:02:15,507
It's really not me.

1802
01:02:15,969 --> 01:02:16,989
Okay.

1803
01:02:17,569 --> 01:02:19,238
Jeon So Min.

1804
01:02:19,239 --> 01:02:20,238
(Will Kwang Soo choose So Min?)

1805
01:02:20,239 --> 01:02:22,351
- Sure. - Okay. It's really not me.

1806
01:02:22,380 --> 01:02:24,899
- Nice to have you. - He's the most suspicious one.

1807
01:02:25,080 --> 01:02:28,211
- It's not me. - I suspected Haha...

1808
01:02:28,319 --> 01:02:29,349
and Jong Kook.

1809
01:02:29,350 --> 01:02:31,318
The important thing to do now is to leave out the returning student.

1810
01:02:31,319 --> 01:02:32,588
(Da Gam, Jae Seok, and Seok Jin are left.)

1811
01:02:32,589 --> 01:02:33,818
(It's Jae Seok's turn again.)

1812
01:02:33,819 --> 01:02:35,930
- I choose... - Wait.

1813
01:02:36,089 --> 01:02:40,189
How is she not the returning student when she has hands in the pocket?

1814
01:02:40,190 --> 01:02:42,059
(She seems suspicious to anyone.)

1815
01:02:42,060 --> 01:02:43,329
She's the returning student.

1816
01:02:43,330 --> 01:02:45,920
(It's the old school trend.)

1817
01:02:46,569 --> 01:02:47,868
She had her hands in her pockets like this.

1818
01:02:47,869 --> 01:02:49,338
Is Da Gam really the returning student?

1819
01:02:49,339 --> 01:02:50,568
She only had her thumbs in.

1820
01:02:50,569 --> 01:02:53,089
This is so unfair to me.

1821
01:02:53,310 --> 01:02:55,248
I saw with my own eyes. During the foot volleyball,

1822
01:02:55,409 --> 01:02:57,479
She had her hands in her pockets and said, "Look who's the boss."

1823
01:02:57,480 --> 01:02:58,579
I heard it.

1824
01:02:58,580 --> 01:03:00,678
(An old school slang used in middle and high school by rebels.)

1825
01:03:00,679 --> 01:03:02,479
- I heard it for sure. - She said it naturally.

1826
01:03:02,480 --> 01:03:03,718
- Really? - "Look who's the boss."

1827
01:03:03,719 --> 01:03:06,269
- Really? - "You were the boss."

1828
01:03:06,819 --> 01:03:08,696
As I said before,

1829
01:03:09,020 --> 01:03:10,489
instead of wanting to be a pair, we need to...

1830
01:03:10,589 --> 01:03:12,428
- avoid the returning student. - We need to do that.

1831
01:03:12,429 --> 01:03:13,481
- Leave the returning student. - The returning student.

1832
01:03:14,699 --> 01:03:16,158
So, I'll choose Jee Seok Jin.

1833
01:03:16,159 --> 01:03:17,258
(So, I'll choose Jee Seok Jin.)

1834
01:03:17,259 --> 01:03:20,228
(Jae Seok chooses Seok Jin instead of Da Gam)

1835
01:03:20,869 --> 01:03:22,439
- Wait. - It's really not me.

1836
01:03:22,440 --> 01:03:24,138
- You're the one. - You're going to regret this.

1837
01:03:24,139 --> 01:03:25,868
- We have to find the one. - Gosh.

1838
01:03:25,869 --> 01:03:27,879
We have to find the returning student.

1839
01:03:27,880 --> 01:03:29,809
This is the first time that a guest member is left out.

1840
01:03:29,810 --> 01:03:31,003
- It's the first time. - It is.

1841
01:03:31,139 --> 01:03:33,863
The last member left is Han Da Gam.

1842
01:03:34,310 --> 01:03:36,318
She's been suspected twice in a row.

1843
01:03:36,319 --> 01:03:37,618
- It's been twice in a row. - That's right.

1844
01:03:37,619 --> 01:03:39,118
She didn't try to fit in.

1845
01:03:39,119 --> 01:03:41,536
If all of you are correct,

1846
01:03:41,560 --> 01:03:43,158
the prizes will be accumulated twice.

1847
01:03:43,159 --> 01:03:44,658
If she's not the returning student,

1848
01:03:44,659 --> 01:03:46,363
the penalties will be accumulated twice.

1849
01:03:46,790 --> 01:03:49,921
This is the last mission to confirm who the returning student is.

1850
01:03:50,699 --> 01:03:51,751
The last mission is...

1851
01:03:51,869 --> 01:03:55,471
a tournament in men and women's division.

1852
01:03:55,500 --> 01:03:59,138
After tying the sleeves of your hoodie together,

1853
01:03:59,139 --> 01:04:01,935
you will have to stick two words on your back.

1854
01:04:01,940 --> 01:04:03,408
You need to find out the words of your opposing player,

1855
01:04:03,409 --> 01:04:05,929
and explain what it is to...

1856
01:04:05,949 --> 01:04:07,989
your partner who has their eyes covered.

1857
01:04:08,020 --> 01:04:09,048
The first pair to get it right wins.

1858
01:04:09,049 --> 01:04:10,650
(The pair who gets both words first wins.)

1859
01:04:11,389 --> 01:04:12,649
A word on the top and the other on the bottom.

1860
01:04:12,650 --> 01:04:14,758
This seems difficult.

1861
01:04:14,759 --> 01:04:15,984
(The list of matches)

1862
01:04:17,360 --> 01:04:18,380
Okay.

1863
01:04:19,259 --> 01:04:22,799
Yu Jae Seok.

1864
01:04:23,230 --> 01:04:26,565
- Lee Kwang Soo. - Yu Jae Seok.

1865
01:04:26,869 --> 01:04:29,368
Lee Bo Gae.

1866
01:04:29,369 --> 01:04:31,349
I want to just see the word.

1867
01:04:31,440 --> 01:04:33,138
I want to see them too but I can't.

1868
01:04:33,139 --> 01:04:34,439
We're starting. Ready.

1869
01:04:34,440 --> 01:04:36,724
- Let's go. - Set.

1870
01:04:37,080 --> 01:04:38,986
At first,

1871
01:04:39,250 --> 01:04:41,149
this is the war of nerves.

1872
01:04:41,150 --> 01:04:42,374
Look at their eyes.

1873
01:04:42,679 --> 01:04:44,791
Jae Seok, you're at a disadvantage if you stand still.

1874
01:04:45,350 --> 01:04:48,189
(Jae Seok starts lowering his height.)

1875
01:04:48,190 --> 01:04:49,189
Your head...

1876
01:04:49,190 --> 01:04:51,127
- They're like wild animals. - You need to turn your head.

1877
01:04:51,330 --> 01:04:53,388
The colors of a giraffe and a grasshopper.

1878
01:04:53,389 --> 01:04:57,059
- The colors suit them well. - They're starting.

1879
01:04:57,060 --> 01:05:00,568
(What are they doing?)

1880
01:05:00,569 --> 01:05:04,477
(They are in their own intense league)

1881
01:05:04,839 --> 01:05:05,890
Look at them.

1882
01:05:06,110 --> 01:05:08,079
I saw this on "Animal Kingdom".

1883
01:05:09,409 --> 01:05:12,164
The giraffe meets the grasshopper.

1884
01:05:12,580 --> 01:05:16,526
(Giraffe as known as Lee Kwang Soo. The eight-footer.)

1885
01:05:17,179 --> 01:05:19,332
(Look, it's a grasshopper.)

1886
01:05:19,690 --> 01:05:21,352
The grasshopper is smelling it.

1887
01:05:22,089 --> 01:05:24,588
(Smelly guy)

1888
01:05:24,589 --> 01:05:27,888
The female giraffe is heading toward the male grasshopper.

1889
01:05:27,889 --> 01:05:29,198
(The mysterious sight of a giraffe and grasshopper's exploration.)

1890
01:05:29,199 --> 01:05:30,251
They're starting.

1891
01:05:30,529 --> 01:05:33,223
The grasshopper is looking at its back.

1892
01:05:33,299 --> 01:05:35,968
Finally, it's the war of nerves.

1893
01:05:35,969 --> 01:05:37,068
They're using their strength now.

1894
01:05:37,069 --> 01:05:38,743
- They're both standing. - They stood up.

1895
01:05:38,869 --> 01:05:40,093
That's right. Quickly.

1896
01:05:40,670 --> 01:05:41,809
That's right. 1,2,3.

1897
01:05:41,810 --> 01:05:44,053
- It's like a mirror. - Move swiftly.

1898
01:05:44,880 --> 01:05:45,900
There you go.

1899
01:05:47,509 --> 01:05:49,249
- Go closer to his face. - There you go.

1900
01:05:49,250 --> 01:05:51,019
- Closer. - That's it.

1901
01:05:51,020 --> 01:05:52,689
(Jae Seok defenses with his flexibility.)

1902
01:05:52,690 --> 01:05:53,710
Good.

1903
01:05:54,190 --> 01:05:55,995
I wish I don't have to go up against those two.

1904
01:05:56,860 --> 01:05:58,287
Haven't you seen it yet, Jae Seok?

1905
01:05:59,389 --> 01:06:02,287
- Kwang Soo, you need more time? - He has a long way to go yet.

1906
01:06:02,699 --> 01:06:03,719
The giraffe...

1907
01:06:04,000 --> 01:06:05,068
versus...

1908
01:06:05,069 --> 01:06:06,269
(Look at these silly guys.)

1909
01:06:06,270 --> 01:06:10,738
(A dirty play between the giraffe and the grasshopper)

1910
01:06:10,739 --> 01:06:15,024
- I've seen this in a movie. - "Secret Garden".

1911
01:06:16,239 --> 01:06:19,178
(How much longer)

1912
01:06:19,179 --> 01:06:21,309
(Do I have to look only at you?)

1913
01:06:21,310 --> 01:06:22,448
- How much longer - Giraffe and the grasshopper.

1914
01:06:22,449 --> 01:06:26,048
(How much longer do they have to do this?)

1915
01:06:26,049 --> 01:06:27,344
- Do I - Do I

1916
01:06:27,949 --> 01:06:30,988
(Kwang Soo,)

1917
01:06:30,989 --> 01:06:34,875
(since when did you have such looks?)

1918
01:06:34,960 --> 01:06:38,629
(What an amazing face you have.)

1919
01:06:38,630 --> 01:06:41,496
(From "Animal Kingdom" to "Secret Garden",)

1920
01:06:41,869 --> 01:06:43,169
(there's no other game like this one.)

1921
01:06:43,170 --> 01:06:44,629
He lifted his back. Now flip him!

1922
01:06:45,770 --> 01:06:49,178
(Kwang Soo attacks Jae Seok's important part.)

1923
01:06:49,179 --> 01:06:50,231
Hey!

1924
01:06:50,679 --> 01:06:52,709
(Scanning the words)

1925
01:06:52,710 --> 01:06:53,709
He got it.

1926
01:06:53,710 --> 01:06:55,413
(So Min, catch this.)

1927
01:06:55,880 --> 01:06:57,448
(The answer is cuteness.)

1928
01:06:57,449 --> 01:06:58,919
Cuteness?

1929
01:06:58,920 --> 01:07:00,379
(She gets it right.)

1930
01:07:00,489 --> 01:07:02,888
Why did you have to meet me?

1931
01:07:02,889 --> 01:07:03,888
Revenge.

1932
01:07:03,889 --> 01:07:05,052
- Why... - "Temptation of Wife"?

1933
01:07:05,830 --> 01:07:07,012
(It's similar.)

1934
01:07:07,429 --> 01:07:08,599
(What on earth is that?)

1935
01:07:08,600 --> 01:07:09,599
So Min.

1936
01:07:09,600 --> 01:07:11,359
(The answer is temptation.)

1937
01:07:11,360 --> 01:07:13,001
- What? - Well...

1938
01:07:13,199 --> 01:07:14,526
- Temptation. - Okay!

1939
01:07:15,069 --> 01:07:16,089
That's right.

1940
01:07:16,699 --> 01:07:19,908
(Kwang Soo wins the match against Jae Seok.)

1941
01:07:19,909 --> 01:07:21,092
What happened?

1942
01:07:21,139 --> 01:07:22,507
- That was impressive. - Goodness.

1943
01:07:22,540 --> 01:07:23,979
- Good game. - Good game.

1944
01:07:23,980 --> 01:07:25,173
- You're good. - Thanks.

1945
01:07:25,650 --> 01:07:26,809
It was a fair play.

1946
01:07:26,810 --> 01:07:28,879
I should have done it.

1947
01:07:28,880 --> 01:07:30,277
(Kwang Soo advances to the next round.)

1948
01:07:30,480 --> 01:07:31,548
(Next round is Haha and Sae Rok versus Se Chan and Jin Young.)

1949
01:07:31,549 --> 01:07:32,818
I saw it.

1950
01:07:32,819 --> 01:07:35,472
- Okay, Jin Young. It's something... - I'm listening.

1951
01:07:35,690 --> 01:07:37,658
- that you do to someone you like. - Pretending?

1952
01:07:37,659 --> 01:07:39,658
(Se Chan easily dominates Haha and gets the first word right.)

1953
01:07:39,659 --> 01:07:42,198
(This time, he coils around Haha like a cobra.)

1954
01:07:42,199 --> 01:07:44,599
(With his merciless attack,)

1955
01:07:44,600 --> 01:07:46,798
(he catches the second word.)

1956
01:07:46,799 --> 01:07:48,798
(Jin Young quickly gets the word right.)

1957
01:07:48,799 --> 01:07:49,899
- This team wins. - Okay.

1958
01:07:49,900 --> 01:07:51,198
(Se Chan advances to the next round.)

1959
01:07:51,199 --> 01:07:52,309
Call me the little Kim Jong Kook.

1960
01:07:52,310 --> 01:07:54,410
(He's confident.)

1961
01:07:55,380 --> 01:07:56,379
Let's do this.

1962
01:07:56,380 --> 01:07:57,539
Show me you aren't a returning student.

1963
01:07:57,540 --> 01:07:59,548
- I'm not. - Then win this match.

1964
01:07:59,710 --> 01:08:01,109
I can't wait to watch this match.

1965
01:08:01,110 --> 01:08:02,349
This will be exciting.

1966
01:08:02,350 --> 01:08:03,880
This is going to be fun.

1967
01:08:03,949 --> 01:08:05,652
Is it the match between the tiger and the giraffe this time?

1968
01:08:05,719 --> 01:08:07,349
- Goodness. - The tiger and the giraffe.

1969
01:08:07,350 --> 01:08:09,868
(Will Kwang Soo, the tallest member, win this match?)

1970
01:08:10,190 --> 01:08:11,729
All right, get ready.

1971
01:08:11,730 --> 01:08:13,459
(The words for each team)

1972
01:08:13,460 --> 01:08:14,480
Get ready.

1973
01:08:14,759 --> 01:08:15,798
Set.

1974
01:08:15,799 --> 01:08:17,559
(The semi-final match starts.)

1975
01:08:17,560 --> 01:08:19,263
Okay, good.

1976
01:08:19,299 --> 01:08:20,298
(Jong Kook presses Kwang Soo with his strength.)

1977
01:08:20,299 --> 01:08:21,524
Jong Kook is enjoying it.

1978
01:08:22,100 --> 01:08:23,160
That's a nice move.

1979
01:08:24,270 --> 01:08:26,169
(The muscular tiger versus the tall giraffe)

1980
01:08:26,170 --> 01:08:27,231
Nice.

1981
01:08:27,270 --> 01:08:28,678
The penalty exemption card is on the line.

1982
01:08:28,679 --> 01:08:29,709
(Kwang Soo trips after jumping alone.)

1983
01:08:29,710 --> 01:08:30,908
My goodness.

1984
01:08:30,909 --> 01:08:32,277
- Hang on. - Kwang Soo.

1985
01:08:32,409 --> 01:08:33,735
Kwang Soo is mad.

1986
01:08:33,950 --> 01:08:35,102
There you go.

1987
01:08:35,620 --> 01:08:36,619
Jong Kook is going to lift him.

1988
01:08:36,620 --> 01:08:37,671
(Kicking)

1989
01:08:39,150 --> 01:08:40,680
All right, let's do this.

1990
01:08:41,089 --> 01:08:42,119
Let's do it.

1991
01:08:42,120 --> 01:08:43,119
(Kwang Soo jumps on him right at that moment.)

1992
01:08:43,120 --> 01:08:44,758
(Jong Kook is below him.)

1993
01:08:44,759 --> 01:08:45,928
What's going on?

1994
01:08:45,929 --> 01:08:47,029
Kwang Soo is making his counterattack.

1995
01:08:47,030 --> 01:08:48,498
(It's the beginning of his counterattack.)

1996
01:08:48,499 --> 01:08:50,366
The giraffe is dominating the tiger!

1997
01:08:51,969 --> 01:08:54,071
Their positions are shifted.

1998
01:08:54,499 --> 01:08:56,699
The giraffe mercilessly attacks the lion.

1999
01:08:56,700 --> 01:08:58,066
(The giraffe ruthlessly kicks the savage animal.)

2000
01:08:59,070 --> 01:09:01,078
(Do you want a beating?)

2001
01:09:01,310 --> 01:09:03,008
(But Jong Kook keeps a smile on his face.)

2002
01:09:03,009 --> 01:09:04,846
There's still a smile on his face.

2003
01:09:05,509 --> 01:09:07,578
You know, tigers play around with their quarry...

2004
01:09:07,579 --> 01:09:09,792
before killing it.

2005
01:09:09,919 --> 01:09:11,959
It must be Jong Kook's new toy.

2006
01:09:12,889 --> 01:09:14,623
He seems curious about his new toy.

2007
01:09:15,190 --> 01:09:17,359
(He doesn't want to play with Jong Kook.)

2008
01:09:17,360 --> 01:09:18,890
- Who's the returning student? - It's not me.

2009
01:09:19,030 --> 01:09:21,508
- Come out now. - Just say it's you, Da Gam.

2010
01:09:21,530 --> 01:09:23,601
- Let's end it here. - Kwang Soo.

2011
01:09:23,929 --> 01:09:25,123
Han Da Gam, come out.

2012
01:09:25,469 --> 01:09:26,856
- Han Da Gam. - Goodness.

2013
01:09:26,999 --> 01:09:28,199
"Han Da Gam, come out."

2014
01:09:28,200 --> 01:09:29,468
(It's time they suspect her, Han Da Gam.)

2015
01:09:29,469 --> 01:09:31,030
I didn't do anything.

2016
01:09:31,810 --> 01:09:33,609
(Jong Kook starts using force...)

2017
01:09:33,610 --> 01:09:35,446
(as no one comes forward to confess.)

2018
01:09:35,910 --> 01:09:37,538
(Just take a look at it.)

2019
01:09:37,539 --> 01:09:39,748
(He scans the words.)

2020
01:09:39,749 --> 01:09:41,078
- Stay still. - He's letting Jong Kook see it.

2021
01:09:41,079 --> 01:09:42,578
- He showed it all. - Jong Kook saw the words.

2022
01:09:42,579 --> 01:09:43,819
(The answer is single since birth.)

2023
01:09:43,820 --> 01:09:46,718
Those guys who were single since they were born.

2024
01:09:46,719 --> 01:09:48,588
(The answer is single since birth.)

2025
01:09:48,589 --> 01:09:49,859
- Single since birth. - Single since birth.

2026
01:09:49,860 --> 01:09:50,910
Single since birth.

2027
01:09:51,829 --> 01:09:53,788
(Kwang Soo wants Ji Hyo to get it right already,)

2028
01:09:53,789 --> 01:09:56,628
(so he reveals the answer faster than anyone else.)

2029
01:09:56,629 --> 01:09:57,758
He said it himself.

2030
01:09:57,759 --> 01:09:59,628
(Jong Kook and Ji Hyo get the first word right.)

2031
01:09:59,629 --> 01:10:00,721
What is going on?

2032
01:10:01,299 --> 01:10:03,033
Are they running?

2033
01:10:03,940 --> 01:10:05,838
His teammate better throw a white towel.

2034
01:10:05,839 --> 01:10:06,859
Goodness.

2035
01:10:07,169 --> 01:10:08,812
Kwang Soo, just show him.

2036
01:10:09,240 --> 01:10:10,361
That's enough!

2037
01:10:10,709 --> 01:10:11,801
Letter of apology!

2038
01:10:13,950 --> 01:10:16,078
(Jae Seok reveals the answer to stop the game.)

2039
01:10:16,079 --> 01:10:17,201
Letter of apology!

2040
01:10:17,650 --> 01:10:18,874
The answer is letter of apology!

2041
01:10:19,690 --> 01:10:21,831
Letter of apology, punk!

2042
01:10:22,160 --> 01:10:23,343
That's the answer.

2043
01:10:23,889 --> 01:10:25,083
Look at him.

2044
01:10:25,889 --> 01:10:27,012
He's turned to a wreck.

2045
01:10:27,389 --> 01:10:28,685
You write this when you did something wrong.

2046
01:10:29,160 --> 01:10:30,199
Letter of apology.

2047
01:10:30,200 --> 01:10:32,004
Not you. Say the answer, Ji Hyo.

2048
01:10:32,629 --> 01:10:34,729
(Ji Hyo, get the answer right already.)

2049
01:10:34,730 --> 01:10:35,798
Letter of apology.

2050
01:10:35,799 --> 01:10:36,891
When you did something wrong.

2051
01:10:37,600 --> 01:10:39,374
It's over.

2052
01:10:39,940 --> 01:10:41,367
- It's over. - What happened?

2053
01:10:42,280 --> 01:10:44,044
- Goodness. - I couldn't see.

2054
01:10:44,839 --> 01:10:45,849
(Jong Kook and Ji Hyo advance to the finals as expected.)

2055
01:10:45,850 --> 01:10:47,787
- My goodness. - I couldn't see.

2056
01:10:48,009 --> 01:10:49,142
Get ready right away, Se Chan.

2057
01:10:49,749 --> 01:10:50,801
You're up next.

2058
01:10:51,219 --> 01:10:52,319
Next is Se Chan.

2059
01:10:52,320 --> 01:10:53,677
I couldn't see the words.

2060
01:10:54,350 --> 01:10:56,019
Se Chan, you look so...

2061
01:10:56,020 --> 01:10:57,388
- Se Chan. - You look...

2062
01:10:57,389 --> 01:10:58,559
- so dark. - Goodness.

2063
01:10:58,560 --> 01:11:00,497
I was feeling cold a while ago, but I'm not anymore. It's nice.

2064
01:11:00,990 --> 01:11:02,199
You think it's nice?

2065
01:11:02,200 --> 01:11:03,798
(How to compete with the warmed-up tiger)

2066
01:11:03,799 --> 01:11:05,299
- Jong Kook. - How relaxed.

2067
01:11:05,629 --> 01:11:06,649
Jong Kook, just look at it.

2068
01:11:06,730 --> 01:11:09,168
- Do it now! - No.

2069
01:11:09,169 --> 01:11:10,802
(Take a peek and get it done already!)

2070
01:11:11,070 --> 01:11:12,838
- Proposal. - Okay.

2071
01:11:12,839 --> 01:11:14,069
- Hulk. - Okay.

2072
01:11:14,070 --> 01:11:16,109
(Jong Kook and Ji Hyo get the answers right in a second.)

2073
01:11:16,110 --> 01:11:18,017
- The winner is... - Okay.

2074
01:11:18,179 --> 01:11:19,548
Kim Jong Kook.

2075
01:11:19,549 --> 01:11:21,309
(Jong Kook wins the game as expected.)

2076
01:11:21,310 --> 01:11:23,678
(And the winner's partner is...)

2077
01:11:23,679 --> 01:11:26,619
- Ji Hyo is no joke. - Ji Hyo is strong.

2078
01:11:26,620 --> 01:11:29,109
- Say things out loud, Jin Young. - Okay.

2079
01:11:29,190 --> 01:11:30,210
Ready, set.

2080
01:11:30,889 --> 01:11:32,053
The first word.

2081
01:11:32,389 --> 01:11:33,859
(She catches the word as soon as the match starts.)

2082
01:11:33,860 --> 01:11:35,287
Jong Kook.

2083
01:11:35,530 --> 01:11:36,550
- It's what we do often. - Wait.

2084
01:11:36,700 --> 01:11:37,828
- Spy. - That's right.

2085
01:11:37,829 --> 01:11:39,665
(They easily get the first word right.)

2086
01:11:39,999 --> 01:11:41,769
(This ace member even controls Jin Young in a leisurely manner.)

2087
01:11:41,770 --> 01:11:43,943
- The first time you kiss someone. - First kiss.

2088
01:11:44,570 --> 01:11:45,691
- First kiss. - It's over.

2089
01:11:46,139 --> 01:11:49,378
(Ji Hyo advances to the finals too.)

2090
01:11:49,379 --> 01:11:50,378
It's crazy.

2091
01:11:50,379 --> 01:11:51,979
(At that time)

2092
01:11:51,980 --> 01:11:53,008
Ready, set.

2093
01:11:53,009 --> 01:11:54,779
(The new challenger appears.)

2094
01:11:54,780 --> 01:11:56,278
Sae Rok, what's wrong with you?

2095
01:11:57,219 --> 01:11:59,019
(The real tough cookie has appeared.)

2096
01:11:59,020 --> 01:12:00,088
What's wrong with you?

2097
01:12:00,089 --> 01:12:03,181
- Nice. - She's strong.

2098
01:12:03,820 --> 01:12:05,258
(So Min lies down to fight against this unexpectedly strong opponent.)

2099
01:12:05,259 --> 01:12:06,310
She's lying down on purpose.

2100
01:12:06,929 --> 01:12:08,836
(I've waited for this.)

2101
01:12:09,459 --> 01:12:12,229
(The frightening shadow of Sae Rok jumps on her.)

2102
01:12:12,230 --> 01:12:13,529
(I'll be easy on you, So Min.)

2103
01:12:13,530 --> 01:12:14,869
So Min might lose.

2104
01:12:14,870 --> 01:12:15,939
(Sae Rok attacks So Min on her.)

2105
01:12:15,940 --> 01:12:16,990
Sorry, So Min.

2106
01:12:17,740 --> 01:12:18,791
So Min!

2107
01:12:18,969 --> 01:12:20,030
Goodness.

2108
01:12:20,139 --> 01:12:21,168
Haha.

2109
01:12:21,169 --> 01:12:23,016
Jae Seok's nickname.

2110
01:12:23,179 --> 01:12:24,333
- Grasshopper. - Grasshopper!

2111
01:12:24,709 --> 01:12:26,852
(They immediately get the words right.)

2112
01:12:27,850 --> 01:12:29,410
Good job.

2113
01:12:29,650 --> 01:12:31,149
Good job.

2114
01:12:31,150 --> 01:12:32,649
(The strong girl, Sae Rok, and the original ace, Ji Hyo...)

2115
01:12:32,650 --> 01:12:34,149
(will be competing in the finals.)

2116
01:12:34,320 --> 01:12:35,850
It's the finals for the female members.

2117
01:12:35,860 --> 01:12:37,349
- Bring them the stickers. - Okay.

2118
01:12:37,959 --> 01:12:39,359
Get lost, Team Green!

2119
01:12:39,360 --> 01:12:40,513
(The members are upset about Team Green.)

2120
01:12:40,560 --> 01:12:41,713
Sae Rok, go for it.

2121
01:12:42,829 --> 01:12:44,159
- Let's do it. - You can do it.

2122
01:12:44,160 --> 01:12:45,328
- I can do it. - Go for it, Sae Rok.

2123
01:12:45,329 --> 01:12:46,498
- Beat Ji Hyo. - Goodness.

2124
01:12:46,499 --> 01:12:48,869
We can't let Ji Hyo become the winner too.

2125
01:12:48,870 --> 01:12:50,298
- Sae Rok, you have to win. - All right.

2126
01:12:50,299 --> 01:12:52,109
Ready, set.

2127
01:12:52,110 --> 01:12:53,741
(Who will be the winner of this big match?)

2128
01:12:54,240 --> 01:12:56,075
Ji Hyo isn't an easy opponent.

2129
01:12:56,079 --> 01:12:57,078
Sae Rok is really strong.

2130
01:12:57,079 --> 01:12:58,208
Really?

2131
01:12:58,209 --> 01:13:00,086
- But she's exhausted. - She's strong.

2132
01:13:00,310 --> 01:13:03,686
Look at Ji Hyo. She's strong too.

2133
01:13:03,719 --> 01:13:05,718
She's rolling the sleeves like Jong Kook did.

2134
01:13:05,719 --> 01:13:06,739
Goodness.

2135
01:13:07,120 --> 01:13:09,741
- Sae Rok is putting all her might. - Did you see it?

2136
01:13:10,490 --> 01:13:11,588
Not yet, sir.

2137
01:13:11,589 --> 01:13:13,599
(She's so polite.)

2138
01:13:14,060 --> 01:13:15,080
What...

2139
01:13:15,799 --> 01:13:17,023
She talks like she's really in college.

2140
01:13:17,100 --> 01:13:19,699
- "No, sir." - It's how freshmen talk.

2141
01:13:19,700 --> 01:13:20,769
"No, sir."

2142
01:13:20,770 --> 01:13:22,298
Go ahead and see it then.

2143
01:13:22,299 --> 01:13:24,074
(Do it, freshman.)

2144
01:13:25,139 --> 01:13:26,669
Yes, sir.

2145
01:13:27,009 --> 01:13:29,578
(She suddenly uses her Herculean strength.)

2146
01:13:29,579 --> 01:13:30,599
Sae Rok is no joke.

2147
01:13:33,179 --> 01:13:34,979
(She spots the word first.)

2148
01:13:34,980 --> 01:13:36,678
Haha.

2149
01:13:36,679 --> 01:13:38,048
- It's two words. - Okay.

2150
01:13:38,049 --> 01:13:40,059
Red light, yellow light.

2151
01:13:40,789 --> 01:13:42,288
Red light, yellow light? Traffic lights!

2152
01:13:42,289 --> 01:13:43,341
- That's right! - Gosh.

2153
01:13:43,759 --> 01:13:46,588
(Sae Rok gets one word right before Ji Hyo.)

2154
01:13:46,589 --> 01:13:49,059
- This is unpredictable. - Sae Rok is amazing.

2155
01:13:49,060 --> 01:13:50,590
- She's no joke. - She's good.

2156
01:13:51,030 --> 01:13:52,599
- Seriously? - Ji Hyo is...

2157
01:13:52,600 --> 01:13:54,742
(Ji Hyo starts her counterattack at that time.)

2158
01:13:55,100 --> 01:13:57,239
Take a look at the other word already.

2159
01:13:57,240 --> 01:13:58,269
(Sae Rok will win if they get one more word right.)

2160
01:13:58,270 --> 01:14:01,609
(But then Ji Hyo starts spinning her like a windmill.)

2161
01:14:01,610 --> 01:14:04,088
(How does it feel to spin around and around?)

2162
01:14:04,839 --> 01:14:06,178
(Sae Rok refuses to get spun anymore.)

2163
01:14:06,179 --> 01:14:07,506
Goodness.

2164
01:14:07,679 --> 01:14:09,048
(It's such a fierce match.)

2165
01:14:09,049 --> 01:14:10,178
My gosh.

2166
01:14:10,179 --> 01:14:11,578
(They don't give each other a slack.)

2167
01:14:11,579 --> 01:14:12,609
- They're good. - What is that?

2168
01:14:13,589 --> 01:14:15,619
- It's showing there. - What's that?

2169
01:14:15,620 --> 01:14:17,619
(Ji Hyo doesn't miss the slight second of her slack.)

2170
01:14:17,620 --> 01:14:18,782
- Goodness. - She saw it.

2171
01:14:19,490 --> 01:14:20,859
Jong Kook, what's other than jjamppong?

2172
01:14:20,860 --> 01:14:21,899
Jjajangmyeon.

2173
01:14:21,900 --> 01:14:23,458
(That's correct.)

2174
01:14:23,459 --> 01:14:24,582
They have one word left each.

2175
01:14:25,030 --> 01:14:27,008
Ji Hyo is different from So Min, isn't she?

2176
01:14:27,030 --> 01:14:28,805
- She's so different. - She's very different.

2177
01:14:29,270 --> 01:14:31,699
She's strong like a man.

2178
01:14:31,700 --> 01:14:33,648
She's trying to hide the other side.

2179
01:14:34,709 --> 01:14:35,965
- Really? - Gosh.

2180
01:14:36,009 --> 01:14:37,878
She gave up on one word to hide the other.

2181
01:14:37,879 --> 01:14:39,809
(Sae Rok is trying to defend the remaining word.)

2182
01:14:39,810 --> 01:14:41,003
Gosh.

2183
01:14:41,179 --> 01:14:43,526
(She's so smart.)

2184
01:14:44,179 --> 01:14:45,923
- How are you going to look though? - I know.

2185
01:14:46,650 --> 01:14:47,888
(It's a nice strategy,)

2186
01:14:47,889 --> 01:14:50,519
(but she can't look at the other's word this way.)

2187
01:14:50,520 --> 01:14:51,958
It's like a cape.

2188
01:14:51,959 --> 01:14:53,189
(Sae Rok somehow ended up in a defensive position.)

2189
01:14:53,190 --> 01:14:56,158
- Sae Rok is defending now. - I know.

2190
01:14:56,929 --> 01:14:57,980
Ji Hyo...

2191
01:14:58,329 --> 01:15:00,168
Ji Hyo is going aggressive.

2192
01:15:00,169 --> 01:15:01,229
(Ji Hyo spins her like a windmill again.)

2193
01:15:01,230 --> 01:15:02,739
- Goodness. - Sae Rok.

2194
01:15:02,740 --> 01:15:03,998
- This is enough. - Sae Rok.

2195
01:15:03,999 --> 01:15:05,192
- Stop it now. - Goodness, Sae Rok.

2196
01:15:05,270 --> 01:15:06,463
- Sae Rok. - Oh, no.

2197
01:15:06,709 --> 01:15:07,838
(She can't move.)

2198
01:15:07,839 --> 01:15:09,063
- Stop it now. - Please.

2199
01:15:09,310 --> 01:15:11,043
Give in now, Sae Rok.

2200
01:15:11,110 --> 01:15:12,436
- This is enough. - Sae Rok.

2201
01:15:12,480 --> 01:15:14,979
- Give in, Sae Rok. - Sae Rok.

2202
01:15:14,980 --> 01:15:17,418
(Ji Hyo scans the remaining word at that time.)

2203
01:15:17,419 --> 01:15:19,632
Jong Kook. It's your nickname.

2204
01:15:20,049 --> 01:15:21,141
- Tiger? - Not that one.

2205
01:15:21,919 --> 01:15:22,958
- What? - A thug.

2206
01:15:22,959 --> 01:15:24,011
Your nickname.

2207
01:15:24,490 --> 01:15:25,714
Other than Ace.

2208
01:15:26,259 --> 01:15:27,350
- Man of Power. - There you go.

2209
01:15:27,730 --> 01:15:28,953
(The answer is Man of Power.)

2210
01:15:29,030 --> 01:15:31,059
(They get the other answer right.)

2211
01:15:31,060 --> 01:15:35,128
(Jong Kook and Ji Hyo both become the winner of the final mission.)

2212
01:15:35,129 --> 01:15:36,338
Good work, Sae Rok.

2213
01:15:36,339 --> 01:15:38,512
- She held up so long. - I know.

2214
01:15:38,910 --> 01:15:39,909
Good work.

2215
01:15:39,910 --> 01:15:41,668
- We need to check the hint first. - Right.

2216
01:15:41,669 --> 01:15:44,127
It's time for the final judgment.

2217
01:15:44,709 --> 01:15:45,975
In the final round,

2218
01:15:46,780 --> 01:15:48,758
- the returning student... - What did the returning student do?

2219
01:15:49,150 --> 01:15:51,119
used an old buzzword.

2220
01:15:51,120 --> 01:15:53,292
(The returning student used an old buzzword.)

2221
01:15:54,020 --> 01:15:56,418
(An old buzzword?)

2222
01:15:56,419 --> 01:15:58,319
- An old buzzword? - Hold on.

2223
01:15:58,320 --> 01:15:59,958
- An old buzzword? - Hold on.

2224
01:15:59,959 --> 01:16:01,529
Earlier... What was it?

2225
01:16:01,530 --> 01:16:04,599
- What was it? - "Look who's the boss."

2226
01:16:04,600 --> 01:16:07,229
- "Look who's the boss." - Haha said it.

2227
01:16:07,230 --> 01:16:08,250
Jong Kook.

2228
01:16:08,639 --> 01:16:11,862
(Before the final round started...)

2229
01:16:12,139 --> 01:16:13,468
(She had her hands in her pockets and said,)

2230
01:16:13,469 --> 01:16:15,008
("Look who's the boss.")

2231
01:16:15,009 --> 01:16:16,609
- I heard it for sure. - "Look who's the boss"?

2232
01:16:16,610 --> 01:16:17,939
- Really? - "Look who's the boss."

2233
01:16:17,940 --> 01:16:19,508
(Haha claimed he heard Da Gam say, "Look who's the boss.")

2234
01:16:19,509 --> 01:16:20,779
- I meant... - Haha is suspicious.

2235
01:16:20,780 --> 01:16:22,178
I meant she said something along the line.

2236
01:16:22,179 --> 01:16:24,378
- Is Haha the returning student? - "Look who's the boss."

2237
01:16:24,379 --> 01:16:25,981
("Look who's the boss" came out of nowhere.)

2238
01:16:26,620 --> 01:16:28,689
If it were a mission,

2239
01:16:28,690 --> 01:16:31,004
he wouldn't have done it so openly.

2240
01:16:31,289 --> 01:16:34,388
I thought Da Gam was the returning student.

2241
01:16:34,389 --> 01:16:35,827
Maybe she isn't it.

2242
01:16:35,929 --> 01:16:38,786
She isn't nervous at all.

2243
01:16:38,829 --> 01:16:42,103
- She is enjoying the show with us. - She is relaxed.

2244
01:16:42,139 --> 01:16:43,769
Think about it.

2245
01:16:43,770 --> 01:16:46,138
- She didn't do anything. - I think it's Sae Rok.

2246
01:16:46,139 --> 01:16:47,769
- Earlier, - Watch her carefully.

2247
01:16:47,770 --> 01:16:49,279
when we played games...

2248
01:16:49,280 --> 01:16:50,708
(Why did she suddenly bring up Sae Rok?)

2249
01:16:50,709 --> 01:16:52,515
She is so scary.

2250
01:16:52,709 --> 01:16:53,729
She said to me...

2251
01:16:54,579 --> 01:16:56,979
- I am sure everyone heard her. - I think it's Da Gam.

2252
01:16:56,980 --> 01:16:58,580
"I think it's Sae Rok."

2253
01:16:59,749 --> 01:17:01,119
(Do you think it's me?)

2254
01:17:01,120 --> 01:17:02,385
"Watch her carefully."

2255
01:17:02,789 --> 01:17:05,328
- Look at her eyes. - It's Da Gam.

2256
01:17:05,329 --> 01:17:06,689
I personally think it's Da Gam.

2257
01:17:06,690 --> 01:17:08,029
It's Da Gam.

2258
01:17:08,030 --> 01:17:09,159
So Min, what do you think?

2259
01:17:09,160 --> 01:17:10,428
I also think it's Da Gam.

2260
01:17:10,429 --> 01:17:11,859
- Everyone thinks it's Da Gam. - Da Gam?

2261
01:17:11,860 --> 01:17:13,604
I also think it's Da Gam.

2262
01:17:14,469 --> 01:17:17,122
You will regret this!

2263
01:17:17,200 --> 01:17:18,708
It's Sae Rok!

2264
01:17:18,709 --> 01:17:20,609
(Is Da Gam the returning student?)

2265
01:17:20,610 --> 01:17:23,138
If Da Gam is the returning student,

2266
01:17:23,139 --> 01:17:26,444
you will divide three prizes among yourselves.

2267
01:17:27,179 --> 01:17:29,159
If Da Gam isn't the returning student,

2268
01:17:29,179 --> 01:17:32,005
you will divide three water bombs among yourselves.

2269
01:17:32,850 --> 01:17:34,277
Do we need to divide them among ourselves?

2270
01:17:34,320 --> 01:17:36,430
- Now, - Da Gam.

2271
01:17:36,459 --> 01:17:38,828
we will remove Da Gam's name tag and check her identity.

2272
01:17:38,829 --> 01:17:40,187
When did they prepare this?

2273
01:17:41,030 --> 01:17:43,298
- Please turn around. - I am really curious.

2274
01:17:43,299 --> 01:17:44,687
Da Gam, we will check your identity.

2275
01:17:44,860 --> 01:17:45,950
In 1, 2.

2276
01:17:47,370 --> 01:17:49,511
(She has to be the returning student.)

2277
01:17:51,139 --> 01:17:54,208
(Da Gam was suspected from the beginning.)

2278
01:17:54,209 --> 01:17:55,439
She acted strangely from the start.

2279
01:17:55,440 --> 01:17:59,080
(What could be Da Gam's identity?)

2280
01:18:00,709 --> 01:18:01,849
What?

2281
01:18:01,850 --> 01:18:04,218
(She isn't the returning student.)

2282
01:18:04,219 --> 01:18:06,535
- Are we wrong? - She isn't the returning student.

2283
01:18:07,049 --> 01:18:09,718
(She was an innocent student who entered the university in 2019.)

2284
01:18:09,719 --> 01:18:11,418
You should have denied it harder.

2285
01:18:11,419 --> 01:18:13,458
I told you I am not it!

2286
01:18:13,459 --> 01:18:15,128
Why didn't you listen to me?

2287
01:18:15,129 --> 01:18:17,628
- Da Gam. - Why didn't you listen to me?

2288
01:18:17,629 --> 01:18:19,168
The returning student is...

2289
01:18:19,169 --> 01:18:21,069
(Who could be the returning student...)

2290
01:18:21,070 --> 01:18:23,038
(who hid his or her identity until the end?)

2291
01:18:23,039 --> 01:18:24,569
- Haha. - My goodness.

2292
01:18:24,570 --> 01:18:26,069
(The returning student is Haha.)

2293
01:18:26,070 --> 01:18:28,638
- It's Haha. - I told you!

2294
01:18:28,639 --> 01:18:29,803
It's Haha.

2295
01:18:29,940 --> 01:18:32,122
- It's Haha. - How could you do this?

2296
01:18:32,610 --> 01:18:33,979
For goodness' sake.

2297
01:18:33,980 --> 01:18:36,718
- How could you? - I told you I am not it.

2298
01:18:36,719 --> 01:18:37,878
Look who's the boss.

2299
01:18:37,879 --> 01:18:40,501
(I did it!)

2300
01:18:41,620 --> 01:18:43,619
(Before the start of the shoot)

2301
01:18:43,620 --> 01:18:45,017
Gosh, this is...

2302
01:18:45,259 --> 01:18:46,758
Haha, you are the returning student...

2303
01:18:46,759 --> 01:18:48,698
who wants to hang out with the new students.

2304
01:18:49,400 --> 01:18:53,174
In Round One, use a style of speech of the returning students.

2305
01:18:53,299 --> 01:18:54,298
"I'll do so-and-so for you."

2306
01:18:54,299 --> 01:18:56,199
(A style of speech of the returning students)

2307
01:18:56,200 --> 01:19:00,595
Say that to all female members once.

2308
01:19:02,539 --> 01:19:05,058
Excuse me. Are there substitutes?

2309
01:19:05,509 --> 01:19:08,279
- I'll drink it for you. - Black Knights?

2310
01:19:08,280 --> 01:19:09,418
They're allowed.

2311
01:19:09,419 --> 01:19:11,619
- Jin Young, I'll do it for you. - Will you drink it?

2312
01:19:11,620 --> 01:19:13,150
(He succeeded to say it to Jin Young.)

2313
01:19:13,289 --> 01:19:15,258
Sae Rok, I'll drink it for you.

2314
01:19:15,789 --> 01:19:17,829
(He succeeded to say it to Sae Rok.)

2315
01:19:18,520 --> 01:19:21,111
(He failed to say it to Da Gam and Ji Hyo.)

2316
01:19:21,129 --> 01:19:23,298
(Haha failed the first hidden mission.)

2317
01:19:23,299 --> 01:19:24,962
In Round Two,

2318
01:19:25,429 --> 01:19:27,998
you must keep your team from placing the first.

2319
01:19:27,999 --> 01:19:31,509
(Keep your team from placing first in the foot volleyball match.)

2320
01:19:33,440 --> 01:19:35,779
(He kicked the wrong way.)

2321
01:19:35,780 --> 01:19:38,609
(He made a home run.)

2322
01:19:38,610 --> 01:19:40,678
(He headed the ball out of the field.)

2323
01:19:40,679 --> 01:19:42,248
- The returning student. - I'm really not.

2324
01:19:42,249 --> 01:19:43,779
- Why would I lose? - I can see that he is one now.

2325
01:19:43,780 --> 01:19:45,177
(He succeeded in the hidden mission.)

2326
01:19:46,719 --> 01:19:49,576
Your hidden mission for the final round...

2327
01:19:49,990 --> 01:19:51,189
is to use an old buzzword,

2328
01:19:51,190 --> 01:19:53,504
"Look who's the boss."

2329
01:19:53,829 --> 01:19:55,798
- "Look who's the boss?" - "Look who's the boss."

2330
01:19:55,900 --> 01:19:57,059
(He didn't know what to do.)

2331
01:19:57,060 --> 01:19:58,998
She had her hands in her pockets and said, "Look who's the boss."

2332
01:19:58,999 --> 01:20:00,029
I heard it for sure.

2333
01:20:00,030 --> 01:20:01,907
"Look who's the boss." I heard it for sure.

2334
01:20:02,200 --> 01:20:03,769
- Really? - "Look who's the boss."

2335
01:20:03,770 --> 01:20:05,199
- Really? - "Look who's the boss."

2336
01:20:05,200 --> 01:20:08,024
(He said "Look who's the boss" and succeeded in the last mission.)

2337
01:20:08,240 --> 01:20:09,667
I can't believe you!

2338
01:20:10,110 --> 01:20:12,979
He behaved strangely during the foot volleyball match.

2339
01:20:12,980 --> 01:20:14,407
I can't believe you.

2340
01:20:14,549 --> 01:20:16,315
You are so shameless.

2341
01:20:16,919 --> 01:20:20,112
Since you failed to catch the returning student,

2342
01:20:20,620 --> 01:20:21,844
you will get three water bombs.

2343
01:20:22,020 --> 01:20:23,958
- They are for 3 people. - Let's pick 3 people.

2344
01:20:23,959 --> 01:20:24,958
That will be neat.

2345
01:20:24,959 --> 01:20:26,458
- That will be neat. - Race of Wits?

2346
01:20:26,629 --> 01:20:27,788
Shall we play the Race of Wits?

2347
01:20:27,789 --> 01:20:29,055
Okay. Let's sit down.

2348
01:20:29,200 --> 01:20:30,729
- Shall we stand up? - Yes.

2349
01:20:30,730 --> 01:20:31,859
Okay.

2350
01:20:31,860 --> 01:20:32,921
Get ready.

2351
01:20:33,770 --> 01:20:34,923
Sit down.

2352
01:20:35,329 --> 01:20:36,421
- Start. - One.

2353
01:20:36,469 --> 01:20:37,520
- 2. - 3.

2354
01:20:40,810 --> 01:20:41,963
- Did you stand up? - All right.

2355
01:20:42,709 --> 01:20:45,979
(Seok Jin and Jae Seok stand up at 3 simultaneously.)

2356
01:20:45,980 --> 01:20:47,178
The two of them...

2357
01:20:47,179 --> 01:20:48,748
The two of them are out.

2358
01:20:48,749 --> 01:20:49,849
(Seok Jin and Jae Seok are out.)

2359
01:20:49,850 --> 01:20:52,063
Why did you stand up?

2360
01:20:52,450 --> 01:20:53,878
For goodness' sake. Why did you stand up?

2361
01:20:54,690 --> 01:20:56,353
One place remains.

2362
01:20:56,959 --> 01:20:59,359
Get ready. Start.

2363
01:20:59,360 --> 01:21:00,359
- 1. - 1.

2364
01:21:00,360 --> 01:21:01,818
(They stood up as soon as the race began.)

2365
01:21:02,030 --> 01:21:04,101
- They are out. - They are out.

2366
01:21:04,360 --> 01:21:07,052
(Kwang Soo and Da Gam stood up simultaneously.)

2367
01:21:07,730 --> 01:21:09,127
One of them will be chosen.

2368
01:21:09,270 --> 01:21:10,596
One of them will be chosen.

2369
01:21:11,339 --> 01:21:12,972
I struggled all day today!

2370
01:21:16,310 --> 01:21:19,370
Then we will have a vote.

2371
01:21:20,049 --> 01:21:21,878
- That came out of nowhere. - The two of us.

2372
01:21:21,879 --> 01:21:23,319
- What? - That came out of nowhere.

2373
01:21:23,320 --> 01:21:24,378
Listen.

2374
01:21:24,379 --> 01:21:25,502
You know,

2375
01:21:26,589 --> 01:21:28,449
having this experience on Running Man...

2376
01:21:28,450 --> 01:21:29,948
- will be a good memory. - Seok Jin.

2377
01:21:30,789 --> 01:21:33,758
(Da Gam hasn't experienced the water bomb.)

2378
01:21:33,759 --> 01:21:36,328
We need to think about the unfairness...

2379
01:21:36,329 --> 01:21:38,268
of having the same person take the water bomb.

2380
01:21:38,900 --> 01:21:40,998
(Kwang Soo always takes the water bomb.)

2381
01:21:40,999 --> 01:21:42,338
Seriously.

2382
01:21:42,339 --> 01:21:43,968
- It's the three of us again. - You are right.

2383
01:21:43,969 --> 01:21:45,638
- This is the same picture. - Yes.

2384
01:21:45,639 --> 01:21:46,690
(Everyone is tired of this picture.)

2385
01:21:47,139 --> 01:21:48,939
You know, having this experience on Running Man...

2386
01:21:48,940 --> 01:21:50,208
(Will they opt...)

2387
01:21:50,209 --> 01:21:54,085
(for a new picture with a new person?)

2388
01:21:54,379 --> 01:21:55,578
- Lee Kwang Soo. - Lee Kwang Soo.

2389
01:21:55,579 --> 01:21:57,048
(Let's make changes later.)

2390
01:21:57,049 --> 01:21:58,479
The penalty will be given to...

2391
01:21:58,480 --> 01:21:59,519
- Lee Kwang Soo. - Lee Kwang Soo.

2392
01:21:59,520 --> 01:22:01,967
(He is familiar with the penalty.)

2393
01:22:02,520 --> 01:22:05,344
Seok Jin, Jae Seok, and Kwang Soo, come to the water bombs.

2394
01:22:05,490 --> 01:22:07,159
It will help you have a fresh start in the New Year.

2395
01:22:07,160 --> 01:22:08,229
(It's a familiar sight.)

2396
01:22:08,230 --> 01:22:09,280
One.

2397
01:22:09,829 --> 01:22:10,951
- Two. - Let's go.

2398
01:22:12,100 --> 01:22:14,729
(Splashing)

2399
01:22:14,730 --> 01:22:16,699
(They get hit...)

2400
01:22:16,700 --> 01:22:19,239
(by a water bomb again.)

2401
01:22:19,240 --> 01:22:21,617
- My goodness. - My goodness.

2402
01:22:22,740 --> 01:22:24,474
Thank you for your hard work.

2403
01:22:24,780 --> 01:22:26,078
Thank you for your hard work.

2404
01:22:26,079 --> 01:22:28,018
(We thank Da Gam, Jin Young, and Sae Rok.)

2405
01:22:29,079 --> 01:22:32,038
(50 mysterious boxes are piled up in a room.)

2406
01:22:32,620 --> 01:22:34,449
(Inside the boxes...)

2407
01:22:34,450 --> 01:22:37,041
(is a big secret.)

2408
01:22:37,419 --> 01:22:40,082
(The moment they open the boxes, their journey begins.)

2409
01:22:41,089 --> 01:22:43,798
(It's a parade of rare items that have never been seen.)

2410
01:22:43,799 --> 01:22:46,369
(From an heirloom that could be a national treasure...)

2411
01:22:46,370 --> 01:22:48,135
(to a vinyl that is hard to find)

2412
01:22:49,169 --> 01:22:50,369
(The items are priced.)

2413
01:22:50,370 --> 01:22:51,625
(We could witness something spectacular.)

2414
01:22:51,870 --> 01:22:53,069
(A dollar?)

2415
01:22:53,070 --> 01:22:54,670
(Zero dollars?)

2416
01:22:54,810 --> 01:22:57,208
(There are more twists.)

2417
01:22:57,209 --> 01:22:58,508
(1,000,000 dollars?)

2418
01:22:58,509 --> 01:22:59,979
(What is the secret behind these boxes?)

2419
01:23:00,150 --> 01:23:01,884
(Unboxing, the Secret of the Boxes)
