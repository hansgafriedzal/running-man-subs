1
00:00:07,131 --> 00:00:09,140
(The show starts with full of energy on a spring day in March.)

2
00:00:09,141 --> 00:00:10,770
- Hello. Hi. - Hi.

3
00:00:10,771 --> 00:00:12,270
- Hello. - Hello.

4
00:00:12,271 --> 00:00:14,009
- Hello. - Hi.

5
00:00:14,010 --> 00:00:15,669
(Hello, everyone.)

6
00:00:15,670 --> 00:00:18,109
You're wearing matching outfits. You two planned it, right?

7
00:00:18,110 --> 00:00:19,949
(Is the theme of your outfit the twin look?)

8
00:00:19,950 --> 00:00:22,309
- It just happened this way. - It was a coincidence?

9
00:00:22,310 --> 00:00:23,594
I was going to change my outfit.

10
00:00:23,650 --> 00:00:25,850
But the clothing brands are different. It just happened.

11
00:00:25,851 --> 00:00:27,820
- You guys didn't plan this? - No, we didn't.

12
00:00:27,821 --> 00:00:29,608
They are like soulmates.

13
00:00:29,661 --> 00:00:32,789
- I think mine looks better. - This is embarrassing.

14
00:00:32,790 --> 00:00:35,660
(If I have to choose, I think mine is better.)

15
00:00:35,661 --> 00:00:37,760
- Hey. - I want us to vote for this.

16
00:00:37,761 --> 00:00:39,500
- His jacket looks great too. - Personally,

17
00:00:39,501 --> 00:00:42,055
I like Jae Seok's jacket more. I like his more than the yellow one.

18
00:00:42,270 --> 00:00:44,199
- My color combination is better. - Your jacket has better colors.

19
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:45,339
- Right. I agree. - His jacket is too much.

20
00:00:45,340 --> 00:00:46,582
Unbelievable.

21
00:00:46,810 --> 00:00:48,709
But with that jacket, you won't be in a car accident.

22
00:00:48,710 --> 00:00:49,779
If you wear that, you won't be.

23
00:00:49,780 --> 00:00:51,325
(It's a checkered jacket with neon-yellow.)

24
00:00:51,511 --> 00:00:53,849
(Safety first! Seok Jin, the Light Bar)

25
00:00:53,850 --> 00:00:55,580
- My goodness. - The colors pop.

26
00:00:55,581 --> 00:00:57,849
(I see. My jacket was for my protection.)

27
00:00:57,850 --> 00:00:59,335
Aren't I right? His jacket is great for that.

28
00:00:59,450 --> 00:01:02,889
We asked you to bring an object you don't need immediately,

29
00:01:02,890 --> 00:01:05,112
but you can't throw out because it's valuable.

30
00:01:05,460 --> 00:01:07,510
We asked you to bring an object each.

31
00:01:09,361 --> 00:01:12,869
(After last week's filming, their mission was given out in advance.)

32
00:01:12,870 --> 00:01:14,629
("To the members of Running Man"...)

33
00:01:14,630 --> 00:01:17,970
(What is the mission that was delivered to the members?)

34
00:01:17,971 --> 00:01:21,110
(It's to bring useless but valuable objects from home.)

35
00:01:21,111 --> 00:01:24,979
Let's check what kind of objects you brought today.

36
00:01:25,010 --> 00:01:26,950
- What's that? It's a mirror. - It's a full-length mirror.

37
00:01:26,951 --> 00:01:29,179
- Is that a snowboard? - It must be a snowboard.

38
00:01:29,180 --> 00:01:30,619
- It's a surfing board. - Isn't that a panel?

39
00:01:30,620 --> 00:01:32,165
- It's a surfing board. - What's that?

40
00:01:32,221 --> 00:01:33,361
Is that a golf club?

41
00:01:33,650 --> 00:01:35,050
- Are those skis? - Everything is so big.

42
00:01:35,051 --> 00:01:37,289
- Everyone brought big stuff. - What's that?

43
00:01:37,290 --> 00:01:38,675
- What's that? - All right.

44
00:01:38,721 --> 00:01:41,418
I was looking through my stuff.

45
00:01:42,161 --> 00:01:43,660
- I brought us a hat I made. - Let us see.

46
00:01:43,661 --> 00:01:44,959
It's pretty big.

47
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:46,000
(The fashion genius, Haha's hat?)

48
00:01:46,001 --> 00:01:47,486
- This is it. - That looks interesting.

49
00:01:48,831 --> 00:01:52,235
(Haha's item: a fedora hat, made by Haha.)

50
00:01:52,540 --> 00:01:54,170
- Didn't you wear that before? - I used to wear this a lot.

51
00:01:54,171 --> 00:01:55,940
- I think you wore that before. - I wore it often.

52
00:01:55,941 --> 00:01:57,628
- You wore that. - Yes, I wore this...

53
00:01:57,680 --> 00:01:59,979
- I remember that. - about 6 to 7 years ago.

54
00:01:59,980 --> 00:02:01,209
- Right, right. - I made this hat.

55
00:02:01,210 --> 00:02:03,479
- I wore this in different colors. - It looks great on him.

56
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:04,580
You look cute.

57
00:02:04,581 --> 00:02:05,763
The hats got crumpled, so I threw them out.

58
00:02:05,891 --> 00:02:07,467
- Does it look great on anyone? - Yes.

59
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:09,035
It looks great on anyone.

60
00:02:09,361 --> 00:02:11,613
- It doesn't look good on him. - It looks terrible on him.

61
00:02:12,691 --> 00:02:14,289
- It looks terrible on him. - What? It looks great on anyone?

62
00:02:14,290 --> 00:02:16,180
- Doesn't it look great on him? - No, it doesn't.

63
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:17,359
It really doesn't look good on him.

64
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:20,058
Are you the King of Beggars? Are you?

65
00:02:20,100 --> 00:02:21,140
Do I look okay?

66
00:02:22,130 --> 00:02:23,312
What do you think? Do I look good?

67
00:02:23,540 --> 00:02:25,669
Wear that to "Comedy Big League" and act as a beggar.

68
00:02:25,670 --> 00:02:27,810
With this hat? But this is fashion.

69
00:02:27,811 --> 00:02:29,557
What about you, Se Chan?

70
00:02:29,681 --> 00:02:30,680
Me?

71
00:02:30,681 --> 00:02:34,852
It's one of the things I always wanted to try out.

72
00:02:35,010 --> 00:02:37,404
I always fail to do this.

73
00:02:37,521 --> 00:02:39,409
I want to go on a diet.

74
00:02:40,050 --> 00:02:41,838
That's why I got ambitious...

75
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:43,490
- You bought it. - The supplement for your diet?

76
00:02:43,491 --> 00:02:45,308
Yes, I bought the supplement. It's brand new.

77
00:02:47,031 --> 00:02:50,061
(Se Chan's item: unopened protein powder)

78
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:51,560
- It's brand new. - That's the protein powder.

79
00:02:51,561 --> 00:02:53,400
- Protein. - It's protein.

80
00:02:53,401 --> 00:02:55,970
- Anyone who works out buys that. - I must buy this.

81
00:02:55,971 --> 00:02:57,470
- I bought this immediately. - I can totally relate.

82
00:02:57,471 --> 00:02:59,139
- That has nothing to do with that. - Right.

83
00:02:59,140 --> 00:03:00,810
- Is that strawberry-flavored? - Yes, it is.

84
00:03:00,811 --> 00:03:02,009
- Gosh, it's strawberry-flavored. - So...

85
00:03:02,010 --> 00:03:05,171
- this is easiest one to swallow. - The strawberry one is good.

86
00:03:05,411 --> 00:03:06,622
This says it's chocolate.

87
00:03:06,811 --> 00:03:08,150
- Chocolate? - This isn't strawberry-flavored.

88
00:03:08,151 --> 00:03:10,402
(No, you're wrong.)

89
00:03:11,121 --> 00:03:13,190
- I guess it's chocolate. - "Chocolate milkshake".

90
00:03:13,191 --> 00:03:14,590
- It's not opened. He doesn't know. - He has to open it to know.

91
00:03:14,591 --> 00:03:16,660
(He doesn't know.)

92
00:03:16,661 --> 00:03:17,690
- I never tasted it. - I thought it was strawberry.

93
00:03:17,691 --> 00:03:20,216
He thought it was strawberry because the bucket was red.

94
00:03:20,661 --> 00:03:22,550
- This is chocolate. - It's chocolate?

95
00:03:22,700 --> 00:03:24,229
Not everything in red is strawberry.

96
00:03:24,230 --> 00:03:26,856
- It had the strawberry color. - Not every supplement is like this.

97
00:03:27,700 --> 00:03:31,104
- He brought the protein supplement. - Yes.

98
00:03:31,371 --> 00:03:33,361
- Who's next? - Kwang Soo is the wild card.

99
00:03:33,640 --> 00:03:34,722
It was for the movie, "The Accidental Detective 2".

100
00:03:35,311 --> 00:03:36,492
I was promoting the movie.

101
00:03:36,580 --> 00:03:37,910
It was when I went to the screenings.

102
00:03:37,911 --> 00:03:39,830
- Come on. - Come on.

103
00:03:40,151 --> 00:03:41,150
It was when I went to the screenings.

104
00:03:41,151 --> 00:03:43,049
(Kwang Soo reveals his cherished item.)

105
00:03:43,050 --> 00:03:44,838
- It's because... No, no. - Come on.

106
00:03:45,950 --> 00:03:49,122
(Kwang Soo's item: life-size cutout of the Prince of Asia)

107
00:03:49,320 --> 00:03:50,889
- Let me explain. - Why did you bring this?

108
00:03:50,890 --> 00:03:53,460
- When I was promoting the movie, - What's wrong with you?

109
00:03:53,461 --> 00:03:54,960
- I used to bring this around. - What are you doing?

110
00:03:54,961 --> 00:03:56,678
After the promotion...

111
00:03:56,730 --> 00:03:57,799
Why did you bring that?

112
00:03:57,800 --> 00:03:59,417
I can't throw this out per se.

113
00:03:59,630 --> 00:04:02,327
Why did they choose this photo out of all those photos?

114
00:04:02,471 --> 00:04:05,039
You should handle this. Why did you bring it here?

115
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:06,050
Listen.

116
00:04:06,211 --> 00:04:07,523
It's a bit iffy to throw this out.

117
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:10,109
- This means a lot to throw it out. - Right.

118
00:04:10,110 --> 00:04:11,609
- You should give that to someone. - That's true.

119
00:04:11,610 --> 00:04:13,064
Some people can use that as a dartboard.

120
00:04:13,181 --> 00:04:14,509
You should give that to someone.

121
00:04:14,510 --> 00:04:16,020
Some people can use that as a dartboard.

122
00:04:16,021 --> 00:04:17,565
- Dartboard? - Why would they do that?

123
00:04:17,681 --> 00:04:19,549
- Get the nose, and it's 10 points. - Right.

124
00:04:19,550 --> 00:04:21,549
Or people can use this for the ironing board.

125
00:04:21,550 --> 00:04:23,641
- How can they use this for ironing? - The ironing board.

126
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:25,919
- My gosh. - It's a life-size cut-out.

127
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:27,809
He sure brought a life-size cut-out.

128
00:04:27,930 --> 00:04:29,516
Why did you say it like that?

129
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:30,912
He asked what you meant by it.

130
00:04:30,961 --> 00:04:32,669
What do you mean by that?

131
00:04:32,670 --> 00:04:33,999
(Please don't get the wrong idea.)

132
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,229
(Feeling insulted for some reason)

133
00:04:35,230 --> 00:04:36,999
- Why do I feel insulted? - No. Wait.

134
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,539
- I mean, it is a life-size cut-out. - But it is a life-size cut-out.

135
00:04:38,540 --> 00:04:39,783
- Right. It is. - Right.

136
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:42,410
- What did you bring, So Min? - I brought...

137
00:04:42,411 --> 00:04:44,510
- She brought memories again. - No, I didn't.

138
00:04:44,511 --> 00:04:45,939
My hobby is painting.

139
00:04:45,940 --> 00:04:48,809
- I used to go to an art academy. - Really?

140
00:04:48,810 --> 00:04:50,849
- This isn't my original painting. - Really?

141
00:04:50,850 --> 00:04:52,349
It's a copy. After looking at a painting,

142
00:04:52,350 --> 00:04:54,549
- I copied the painting. - You copied it.

143
00:04:54,550 --> 00:04:55,720
- You did a great job though. - Right.

144
00:04:55,721 --> 00:04:56,903
- Did you draw this? - Yes.

145
00:04:56,961 --> 00:04:58,419
- You drew that? - My gosh.

146
00:04:58,420 --> 00:04:59,945
You're good at painting.

147
00:04:59,990 --> 00:05:02,090
- My gosh. You really drew these? - Goodness.

148
00:05:02,091 --> 00:05:03,130
- Yes. - It looks like a print.

149
00:05:03,131 --> 00:05:04,299
- These are fantastic paintings. - I...

150
00:05:04,300 --> 00:05:05,559
There are parrots.

151
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:07,288
- Yes, there are parrots. - So Min, you drew them?

152
00:05:07,370 --> 00:05:09,169
- This is a watercolor painting. - You did a great job on them.

153
00:05:09,170 --> 00:05:10,299
I used acrylic paints for this.

154
00:05:10,300 --> 00:05:11,999
- How can you draw that well? - You're so cool.

155
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,470
You can do this once you learn how.

156
00:05:13,471 --> 00:05:14,925
- You did a great job. - She drew them very well.

157
00:05:14,971 --> 00:05:16,410
Did you like your art teacher or something?

158
00:05:16,411 --> 00:05:17,824
- They are great. - They are kissing. Look at this.

159
00:05:18,381 --> 00:05:19,650
- She is talented. - They're kissing.

160
00:05:19,651 --> 00:05:20,650
(Two parrots are kissing.)

161
00:05:20,651 --> 00:05:21,964
I bet there is a meaning behind this painting.

162
00:05:22,350 --> 00:05:24,179
In my opinion, I think So Min...

163
00:05:24,180 --> 00:05:25,880
brought all of her paintings on purpose.

164
00:05:25,881 --> 00:05:27,467
- She could've brought only one. - Right.

165
00:05:27,591 --> 00:05:29,106
I wonder why she brought all of them.

166
00:05:29,151 --> 00:05:31,443
I'd like to raise suspicions on why she brought all of them.

167
00:05:31,521 --> 00:05:33,359
- Did you bring them for someone? - No, no.

168
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:34,501
It's not that.

169
00:05:34,891 --> 00:05:36,880
Do you want your ex to watch this, so you can hurt him?

170
00:05:37,461 --> 00:05:38,900
- "I'll get rid of these." - I think...

171
00:05:38,901 --> 00:05:41,960
She films "Love on the Air" on our show.

172
00:05:42,201 --> 00:05:44,999
- Someone must be crying now. - Exactly.

173
00:05:45,141 --> 00:05:46,958
- You can't end things like this. - Right.

174
00:05:47,011 --> 00:05:48,587
She's driving me crazy.

175
00:05:49,110 --> 00:05:51,140
All right. We enjoyed looking at So Min's paintings.

176
00:05:51,141 --> 00:05:52,251
- As for me... - Okay.

177
00:05:53,050 --> 00:05:55,280
- Isn't that a guitar? - I brought a guitar.

178
00:05:55,281 --> 00:05:56,450
- Really? - Really?

179
00:05:56,451 --> 00:05:57,794
I wanted to learn how to play it back in the days.

180
00:05:58,250 --> 00:06:00,209
- Woo Seung Min gave me this. - Here.

181
00:06:00,651 --> 00:06:02,390
He gave me this as a present.

182
00:06:02,391 --> 00:06:03,390
- It's beautiful. - Really?

183
00:06:03,391 --> 00:06:05,077
- The guitar is very beautiful. - It's beautiful.

184
00:06:05,461 --> 00:06:06,542
- It's beautiful. - How pretty.

185
00:06:06,831 --> 00:06:10,530
(Jae Seok's item: an electric guitar for a wannabe rockstar)

186
00:06:10,531 --> 00:06:12,046
- It's a beautiful guitar. - Yes, so this is...

187
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:14,043
It's so cute.

188
00:06:14,201 --> 00:06:17,270
- If you can play the guitar well... - My gosh, how much is that?

189
00:06:17,271 --> 00:06:19,200
It's just collecting dust at my house.

190
00:06:19,201 --> 00:06:21,510
- And I feel terrible about it. - It's completely new.

191
00:06:21,511 --> 00:06:23,400
- I didn't play it at all. - My goodness.

192
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:25,360
- I really want that one. - It's better for the guitar too.

193
00:06:25,980 --> 00:06:27,364
This is the place. You just need to hook it up here.

194
00:06:27,610 --> 00:06:28,862
You can plug it in here.

195
00:06:29,180 --> 00:06:31,679
You can make it sound like this.

196
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:33,337
- I see. That? - You can do this with it.

197
00:06:33,490 --> 00:06:35,612
What? No, that's not the spot.

198
00:06:36,420 --> 00:06:38,744
(Transforming into a rockstar)

199
00:06:39,461 --> 00:06:41,148
- Doesn't that go there? - That's not the spot.

200
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:42,572
No, it goes here.

201
00:06:42,930 --> 00:06:44,160
- Wait, am I wrong? - That's not it.

202
00:06:44,161 --> 00:06:46,292
- If you're not sure, don't do that. - It has to go up.

203
00:06:46,401 --> 00:06:48,630
- That's for the cord. - That's the output jack.

204
00:06:48,631 --> 00:06:50,014
How can you plug that in there?

205
00:06:50,071 --> 00:06:51,181
He plugged it in the jack.

206
00:06:51,641 --> 00:06:52,680
Let me check.

207
00:06:53,810 --> 00:06:56,140
My gosh, he plugged it in the wrong spot and bragged.

208
00:06:56,141 --> 00:06:57,140
"Don't you know this?"

209
00:06:57,141 --> 00:07:00,179
(He's a star who's the best at bragging.)

210
00:07:00,180 --> 00:07:01,979
- Instruments have their owners. - That's right.

211
00:07:01,980 --> 00:07:03,597
- I want someone to take this. - Okay.

212
00:07:04,021 --> 00:07:05,799
I want someone who can play the guitar take this.

213
00:07:05,951 --> 00:07:07,364
It's my turn now.

214
00:07:07,420 --> 00:07:08,749
- Go ahead. - Okay!

215
00:07:08,750 --> 00:07:10,983
- Let me tell you what I brought. - Seok Jin.

216
00:07:11,461 --> 00:07:13,308
I thought long and hard about what to bring.

217
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:15,684
I have a guitar that I bought when I was in ninth grade.

218
00:07:16,430 --> 00:07:17,571
- I had the guitar. - From the 80s?

219
00:07:17,701 --> 00:07:18,999
- From the 70s? - It's a guitar.

220
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,999
I like everything about my wife,

221
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,192
but what I don't like about my wife is...

222
00:07:23,370 --> 00:07:24,411
that she throws out stuff too easily.

223
00:07:25,170 --> 00:07:26,484
She threw out the guitar.

224
00:07:26,540 --> 00:07:28,340
But she managed to keep you around when she throws out a lot of things.

225
00:07:28,341 --> 00:07:30,966
(He's brutally honest.)

226
00:07:32,341 --> 00:07:33,580
(All of a sudden, she became a dutiful wife.)

227
00:07:33,581 --> 00:07:34,924
Anyway, she's a saint.

228
00:07:34,980 --> 00:07:37,749
- He's so brutal. - You're unbelievable.

229
00:07:37,750 --> 00:07:39,689
I didn't think that far. In hindsight, I should be grateful.

230
00:07:39,690 --> 00:07:41,289
- Exactly. - I should be thankful.

231
00:07:41,290 --> 00:07:43,289
- She throws out a lot of things. - That was a hard blow.

232
00:07:43,290 --> 00:07:44,619
Anyway, she threw out the guitar,

233
00:07:44,620 --> 00:07:45,919
so I brought this after much thinking.

234
00:07:45,920 --> 00:07:47,143
- Back in the days, - What is it?

235
00:07:47,230 --> 00:07:49,999
there was a time when I was into fashion.

236
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,274
Back in the days, Seok Jin...

237
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:54,030
was very interested in fashion for some time.

238
00:07:54,031 --> 00:07:56,596
There was a phase when I bought a lot of clothes.

239
00:07:56,670 --> 00:07:59,064
- Really? - Was that in the 80s?

240
00:07:59,271 --> 00:08:02,470
But the thing about Seok Jin is that when he was interested in fashion,

241
00:08:02,471 --> 00:08:04,158
he would wear white pants.

242
00:08:04,310 --> 00:08:05,809
He was hooked on white clothes.

243
00:08:05,810 --> 00:08:06,950
(Seok Jin was the leader of all-white outfits.)

244
00:08:06,951 --> 00:08:08,597
When was that? That must've been...

245
00:08:08,750 --> 00:08:11,080
- During the white-clad folk times? - White-clad folk times?

246
00:08:11,081 --> 00:08:12,450
Are you talking about the white-clad folk times?

247
00:08:12,451 --> 00:08:13,632
How long was that?

248
00:08:13,790 --> 00:08:14,963
- A long time ago, - 70 or 80...

249
00:08:15,391 --> 00:08:17,713
I learned that we used to be white-clad people in school.

250
00:08:17,761 --> 00:08:19,852
- That must've been true. - White-clad folk?

251
00:08:20,631 --> 00:08:23,024
- White-clad folk. - His outfits were all white.

252
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:26,669
- What is it? - I thought I should dress better.

253
00:08:26,670 --> 00:08:27,882
I thought I should dress young.

254
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,415
So I bought clothes.

255
00:08:29,471 --> 00:08:31,187
- This isn't cheap. - Seriously.

256
00:08:31,300 --> 00:08:32,512
What's that?

257
00:08:32,870 --> 00:08:35,264
What's that?

258
00:08:35,310 --> 00:08:36,410
What is that?

259
00:08:36,411 --> 00:08:37,926
- This is my jacket. - It looks nice.

260
00:08:38,881 --> 00:08:40,410
(Seok Jin's item: blue vinyl jumper and white pants)

261
00:08:40,411 --> 00:08:41,865
(Memories of Fashionable Seok Jin)

262
00:08:42,950 --> 00:08:44,579
(Ta-da! That looks amazing!)

263
00:08:44,580 --> 00:08:46,196
- You think so? - It's nice, isn't it?

264
00:08:46,450 --> 00:08:48,250
- This... - People who can't dress well...

265
00:08:48,251 --> 00:08:49,250
think the jacket looks nice.

266
00:08:49,251 --> 00:08:51,490
(It suits the taste of people who don't know about fashion.)

267
00:08:51,491 --> 00:08:52,490
Why? It looks nice.

268
00:08:52,491 --> 00:08:54,589
People who can't dress well must think that's nice.

269
00:08:54,590 --> 00:08:56,045
I sort of thought it looked nice too.

270
00:08:56,261 --> 00:08:57,746
- This is... - I thought the same thing.

271
00:08:58,060 --> 00:09:00,000
- People like us find it nice. - Hey, this is...

272
00:09:00,001 --> 00:09:01,600
- I can... - It doesn't look cute.

273
00:09:01,601 --> 00:09:03,489
- It doesn't look cute. - Why not?

274
00:09:03,540 --> 00:09:05,288
- Look over here. - It's futuristic and nice.

275
00:09:05,401 --> 00:09:07,936
This is a cutting-edge jacket because inside, there is...

276
00:09:08,611 --> 00:09:10,832
- a hole to put your earphones. - Is that what it's for?

277
00:09:10,881 --> 00:09:12,610
- You didn't know? - My jacket had a hole,

278
00:09:12,611 --> 00:09:13,721
so I was about to get it refunded.

279
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:16,100
- I didn't know this was for that. - Why don't you try it on?

280
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:19,008
Why don't you put it on? We must check how it fits.

281
00:09:19,450 --> 00:09:20,865
My gosh, Seok Jin.

282
00:09:21,950 --> 00:09:23,089
It looks nice.

283
00:09:23,090 --> 00:09:26,394
I understand now why these two wore the matching outfits today.

284
00:09:26,430 --> 00:09:27,774
- During the opening segment? - Gosh.

285
00:09:27,830 --> 00:09:29,750
It's not easy to buy that with that much money.

286
00:09:30,631 --> 00:09:33,069
I'm supposed to zip up this jacket.

287
00:09:33,070 --> 00:09:34,270
You look great.

288
00:09:34,271 --> 00:09:35,815
- Doesn't he look like a mackerel? - My gosh.

289
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:39,199
(A happy mackerel outfit)

290
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:40,910
- He's a blue fish. - A blue fish like a herring.

291
00:09:40,911 --> 00:09:42,324
- A herring. - A herring.

292
00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:45,106
Anyway, I ended up buying this.

293
00:09:45,381 --> 00:09:47,067
- My gosh. - That's too much.

294
00:09:47,210 --> 00:09:48,579
- Se Chan wants to try it on. - I want to.

295
00:09:48,580 --> 00:09:50,150
- I really want that jacket. Yes. - Really?

296
00:09:50,151 --> 00:09:51,594
- Do you want to try it on? - Yes, Seok Jin. Let me.

297
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:52,949
But Seok Jin, that's...

298
00:09:52,950 --> 00:09:54,949
Gosh, paying that much for that jacket is too much.

299
00:09:54,950 --> 00:09:56,250
(Reckless Se Chan is digging his own hole.)

300
00:09:56,251 --> 00:09:57,372
As long as it fits...

301
00:09:57,560 --> 00:09:58,701
Hey, that's totally you!

302
00:09:58,920 --> 00:10:00,071
Hey, that belongs to you.

303
00:10:01,031 --> 00:10:03,260
(I'm a baby mackerel!)

304
00:10:03,261 --> 00:10:06,260
(Now, I'm the shabbiest mackerel!)

305
00:10:06,261 --> 00:10:08,523
- My gosh, look at me. - Give him the guitar.

306
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:09,912
- All right, Se Chan. - Okay.

307
00:10:10,241 --> 00:10:11,270
- Jae Seok. - Seriously.

308
00:10:11,271 --> 00:10:13,069
- He's the musician of the street. - Everything belongs to me.

309
00:10:13,070 --> 00:10:14,140
- Se Chan. - Are you serious?

310
00:10:14,141 --> 00:10:15,888
- My gosh. Today is your day. - I love it.

311
00:10:16,141 --> 00:10:17,939
I guess this guitar belonged to you.

312
00:10:17,940 --> 00:10:19,223
- My goodness. - You know?

313
00:10:19,540 --> 00:10:21,079
- It was Se Chan's. - It went to its owner at last.

314
00:10:21,080 --> 00:10:22,449
My gosh, this is crazy.

315
00:10:22,450 --> 00:10:25,419
(I'm the worst dresser of this area.)

316
00:10:25,420 --> 00:10:26,633
- Hey, stay right there. - Haha.

317
00:10:27,151 --> 00:10:28,200
Gosh, this is...

318
00:10:28,521 --> 00:10:29,732
That's yours.

319
00:10:30,121 --> 00:10:31,373
This is totally you.

320
00:10:31,521 --> 00:10:32,874
- Se Chan, it belongs to you. - Jae Seok.

321
00:10:32,920 --> 00:10:35,254
- My gosh. Are you serious? - You know...

322
00:10:35,391 --> 00:10:37,829
I was wondering who would take this, but it was you.

323
00:10:37,830 --> 00:10:40,000
- I love it. I'm serious. - I get what he likes.

324
00:10:40,001 --> 00:10:41,730
I can't believe he actually likes it.

325
00:10:41,731 --> 00:10:43,620
Great. It's Ji Hyo's turn.

326
00:10:43,741 --> 00:10:45,155
Actually...

327
00:10:45,771 --> 00:10:47,053
- What is it? - That's big.

328
00:10:47,241 --> 00:10:48,910
- Is that a golf club? - No.

329
00:10:48,911 --> 00:10:52,010
I'm sure you've never seen this before.

330
00:10:52,011 --> 00:10:53,209
- I... - What is it?

331
00:10:53,210 --> 00:10:55,079
- As you know, I'm scared of bugs. - Right.

332
00:10:55,080 --> 00:10:56,736
- I can't step on them... - You despise them.

333
00:10:56,881 --> 00:10:59,579
- or smack them to kill them. - That's true.

334
00:10:59,580 --> 00:11:02,319
I talked to my manager about this, and it took my manager...

335
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:03,789
- several days to find it. - He looked it up online.

336
00:11:03,790 --> 00:11:06,760
He bought it from overseas and gave it to me.

337
00:11:07,031 --> 00:11:08,606
I'm so embarrassed.

338
00:11:08,731 --> 00:11:11,429
My mom scolded me after my manager gave me this as a present.

339
00:11:11,430 --> 00:11:13,895
- Why? - She thought it was useless.

340
00:11:14,170 --> 00:11:15,169
This...

341
00:11:15,170 --> 00:11:16,383
- What is that? - What is it?

342
00:11:16,940 --> 00:11:18,799
- What is that? - What is that?

343
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:20,610
(What is that?)

344
00:11:20,611 --> 00:11:21,651
What is that?

345
00:11:22,070 --> 00:11:24,060
- That's a flame thrower. - Isn't that dangerous?

346
00:11:24,210 --> 00:11:25,756
It says, "Caution, Burn Hazard".

347
00:11:26,680 --> 00:11:29,205
(Everyone is shocked.)

348
00:11:29,881 --> 00:11:31,219
(It shocks everyone instantly.)

349
00:11:31,220 --> 00:11:33,039
(What is this unidentified object Ji Hyo took out?)

350
00:11:33,351 --> 00:11:36,089
(Ji Hyo's item: a flame thrower that catches bugs?)

351
00:11:36,090 --> 00:11:37,789
(No! It's a flame weeder that burns weed.)

352
00:11:37,790 --> 00:11:40,315
- That's a flame thrower. - Just to catch bugs?

353
00:11:41,161 --> 00:11:43,220
I really thought hard about it.

354
00:11:43,261 --> 00:11:45,160
- I almost bought a flame thrower. - Seriously?

355
00:11:45,161 --> 00:11:46,569
- You used that in your house? - To catch bugs?

356
00:11:46,570 --> 00:11:47,783
No, I use it outdoors.

357
00:11:47,830 --> 00:11:49,446
- Let me see. - And...

358
00:11:50,241 --> 00:11:52,361
the bugs fly away when I turn this on.

359
00:11:52,401 --> 00:11:53,770
- Unbelievable. - I see...

360
00:11:53,771 --> 00:11:55,427
cautionary signs for burns all over this thing.

361
00:11:55,771 --> 00:11:57,629
This is the only part I can actually grab this with.

362
00:11:58,180 --> 00:11:59,610
- Why did you... - Hey...

363
00:11:59,611 --> 00:12:01,772
This will look great on Jong Kook.

364
00:12:01,981 --> 00:12:03,480
It will look great on Jong Kook.

365
00:12:03,481 --> 00:12:05,944
- We should bring things like that. - Right.

366
00:12:06,521 --> 00:12:07,702
- This is it. - Right.

367
00:12:08,151 --> 00:12:10,289
- I'm in trouble now. - What did you bring, Jong Kook?

368
00:12:10,290 --> 00:12:11,431
Today,

369
00:12:11,690 --> 00:12:13,589
I brought RPR's CD.

370
00:12:13,590 --> 00:12:15,448
(Reggae, Peaceful Like a River)

371
00:12:15,891 --> 00:12:19,396
(Jong Kook's item: his number 1 butler, Haha's CD)

372
00:12:20,001 --> 00:12:21,949
I brought RPR's CD.

373
00:12:22,001 --> 00:12:23,030
Darn you.

374
00:12:23,031 --> 00:12:26,132
(The butler is mad.)

375
00:12:26,340 --> 00:12:27,770
- The thing is, - That's a bit...

376
00:12:27,771 --> 00:12:30,204
I don't need to use this CD.

377
00:12:30,641 --> 00:12:33,250
But I can't throw it out because it's precious to me.

378
00:12:33,251 --> 00:12:34,524
Isn't that right?

379
00:12:34,810 --> 00:12:36,949
I'm at a loss for words.

380
00:12:36,950 --> 00:12:38,850
I don't think I have one.

381
00:12:38,851 --> 00:12:40,719
- Me, neither. - It looks like a parcel.

382
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:43,390
I only gave them to those who came to my concert as guests.

383
00:12:43,391 --> 00:12:45,620
- I didn't make many of them. - It's a special edition.

384
00:12:45,621 --> 00:12:47,390
- You're right. - He signed it.

385
00:12:47,391 --> 00:12:50,260
There's a cassette tape and a badge.

386
00:12:50,261 --> 00:12:51,260
- Really? - Really?

387
00:12:51,261 --> 00:12:53,299
- It's a gift set. - You're right.

388
00:12:53,300 --> 00:12:55,018
- It must've been expensive. - It was.

389
00:12:55,170 --> 00:12:57,640
I'm glad you didn't sell it on a secondhand site.

390
00:12:57,641 --> 00:12:58,699
You had it with you.

391
00:12:58,700 --> 00:13:01,266
My name was written here, so I couldn't sell it.

392
00:13:02,040 --> 00:13:03,510
So you've thought of doing that.

393
00:13:03,511 --> 00:13:06,010
(Jong Kook thought about selling it.)

394
00:13:06,011 --> 00:13:08,737
No, it's not like that. I just had this on my mind.

395
00:13:09,151 --> 00:13:10,535
Why did you tell us to bring these?

396
00:13:10,851 --> 00:13:12,597
I'll explain it to you.

397
00:13:12,950 --> 00:13:15,274
Today, the team that can find out how to win...

398
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:18,422
after opening boxes will win.

399
00:13:18,590 --> 00:13:20,189
It's called the Unboxing Race.

400
00:13:20,190 --> 00:13:22,559
(Unboxing Race)

401
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:25,025
You'll be divided into three teams...

402
00:13:25,161 --> 00:13:28,069
and will have to bid for the boxes.

403
00:13:28,070 --> 00:13:31,778
You can sell or exchange the items you have brought...

404
00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:34,538
in order to get money for this mission.

405
00:13:34,940 --> 00:13:36,579
This is how you'll divide into teams.

406
00:13:36,580 --> 00:13:39,209
Have you registered your fingerprints on your phone?

407
00:13:39,210 --> 00:13:40,220
- Yes. - Yes.

408
00:13:40,981 --> 00:13:44,314
Unlike the previous phones, you can register at the front.

409
00:13:44,580 --> 00:13:45,949
(They registered their fingerprints.)

410
00:13:45,950 --> 00:13:47,419
Done. Look.

411
00:13:47,420 --> 00:13:49,774
- I'm all done. - Done.

412
00:13:50,060 --> 00:13:51,089
I'm finished.

413
00:13:51,090 --> 00:13:54,798
Your phones are being used to charge earphones.

414
00:13:54,960 --> 00:13:57,627
- You charge it at the back. - Right.

415
00:13:57,960 --> 00:14:00,091
Once the earphones are done charging,

416
00:14:00,371 --> 00:14:03,130
- they'll turn green. - How convenient.

417
00:14:03,131 --> 00:14:04,699
- Goodness. - Is it charging?

418
00:14:04,700 --> 00:14:06,185
- It is. - Wow.

419
00:14:06,970 --> 00:14:09,031
- They're just the right fit. - Goodness.

420
00:14:09,411 --> 00:14:10,450
They're perfect.

421
00:14:10,710 --> 00:14:12,356
She's right.

422
00:14:12,440 --> 00:14:13,561
It's very comfortable.

423
00:14:13,611 --> 00:14:15,368
- You put them on wrong. - Really?

424
00:14:16,281 --> 00:14:19,650
(Seok Jin needs to get used to technology.)

425
00:14:19,651 --> 00:14:21,609
This is how you'll split into teams.

426
00:14:21,751 --> 00:14:24,315
Each of you will call someone randomly.

427
00:14:24,790 --> 00:14:28,023
You'll partner up with the receiver on the other line.

428
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:30,130
I'll call now.

429
00:14:30,131 --> 00:14:32,282
(Seok Jin goes first.)

430
00:14:32,930 --> 00:14:35,230
I can press on any number from 1 to 8, right?

431
00:14:35,231 --> 00:14:36,770
(Whom will he call?)

432
00:14:36,771 --> 00:14:38,861
(Anticipating)

433
00:14:40,310 --> 00:14:41,855
- He's calling. - What?

434
00:14:42,310 --> 00:14:43,825
- What? - It's Se Chan.

435
00:14:43,881 --> 00:14:46,002
Tap, tap. Hello?

436
00:14:46,611 --> 00:14:47,661
Hello?

437
00:14:49,511 --> 00:14:52,207
- Why did you press six? - Who is this?

438
00:14:52,521 --> 00:14:53,620
Okay.

439
00:14:53,621 --> 00:14:55,350
- Come here. - I'll be on my way.

440
00:14:55,351 --> 00:14:57,077
This is nice.

441
00:14:57,190 --> 00:14:59,490
- Okay. - It's the protein and old clothes.

442
00:14:59,491 --> 00:15:01,683
- This will be a problem. - You'll be with Seok Jin.

443
00:15:01,761 --> 00:15:03,630
Since money matters,

444
00:15:03,631 --> 00:15:05,360
we'll need to partner up with those who have...

445
00:15:05,361 --> 00:15:06,829
- Expensive items. - good items.

446
00:15:06,830 --> 00:15:08,270
It's either Jae Seok or Ji Hyo.

447
00:15:08,271 --> 00:15:09,270
You're right.

448
00:15:09,271 --> 00:15:11,000
The worst is Kwang Soo.

449
00:15:11,001 --> 00:15:12,152
No, you're wrong.

450
00:15:12,371 --> 00:15:13,986
- He's the worst one. - Wait.

451
00:15:14,241 --> 00:15:15,856
Why do I feel insulted?

452
00:15:16,241 --> 00:15:17,524
It's... It's...

453
00:15:18,840 --> 00:15:19,839
Hello?

454
00:15:19,840 --> 00:15:20,922
Ji Hyo, it's me.

455
00:15:21,050 --> 00:15:22,263
Hi, Se Chan.

456
00:15:22,351 --> 00:15:24,819
- Seok Jin, Se Chan, and Ji Hyo. - We're a team.

457
00:15:24,820 --> 00:15:25,980
Them three?

458
00:15:25,981 --> 00:15:27,001
Who is this?

459
00:15:27,121 --> 00:15:28,520
It's So Min.

460
00:15:28,521 --> 00:15:29,803
So Min, hi.

461
00:15:30,121 --> 00:15:32,312
- Haha. - Hi, So Min.

462
00:15:32,920 --> 00:15:35,130
- Is this Haha? - Yes, it is.

463
00:15:35,131 --> 00:15:37,079
We can do it. We're best friends.

464
00:15:38,001 --> 00:15:40,526
Then are Jae Seok and I a team?

465
00:15:40,570 --> 00:15:41,611
Okay!

466
00:15:42,401 --> 00:15:43,439
(Jae Seok and Kwang Soo are a team.)

467
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:45,400
This is terrible.

468
00:15:45,401 --> 00:15:46,450
Okay!

469
00:15:47,070 --> 00:15:48,152
We'll definitely win!

470
00:15:48,570 --> 00:15:50,399
WIth Jae Seok's guitar, we'll win!

471
00:15:50,641 --> 00:15:54,246
(Team Jae Seok, Team Jong Kook, Team Seok Jin)

472
00:15:54,580 --> 00:15:56,719
Let's go to Sangam-dong since the stations are there.

473
00:15:56,720 --> 00:15:57,893
You're right.

474
00:15:58,080 --> 00:15:59,520
No one will buy mine.

475
00:15:59,521 --> 00:16:00,520
- Wait. - Ji Hyo.

476
00:16:00,521 --> 00:16:03,020
- The seller needs to speak well. - Right.

477
00:16:03,021 --> 00:16:04,020
- Right. - Se Chan.

478
00:16:04,021 --> 00:16:05,260
- I trust in you. - Don't worry.

479
00:16:05,261 --> 00:16:06,947
Yours won't be a problem.

480
00:16:07,261 --> 00:16:08,442
But you know what?

481
00:16:09,190 --> 00:16:10,413
I'm a bit worried about yours.

482
00:16:11,401 --> 00:16:12,929
(These stage costumes from the past aren't that tempting.)

483
00:16:12,930 --> 00:16:14,849
- Hey. - I understand why you picked them.

484
00:16:15,001 --> 00:16:17,039
But they're old-fashioned.

485
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:18,539
- I like them, but... - That's why...

486
00:16:18,540 --> 00:16:20,026
they're the best for idol singers.

487
00:16:20,210 --> 00:16:22,029
Idol singers will love them.

488
00:16:22,710 --> 00:16:24,428
- If we come across any, - Then...

489
00:16:24,540 --> 00:16:26,880
they'll definitely like these.

490
00:16:26,881 --> 00:16:28,770
We could meet them at the music shows.

491
00:16:28,881 --> 00:16:29,992
You're right.

492
00:16:30,580 --> 00:16:31,631
Let's go to Sangam-dong first.

493
00:16:31,981 --> 00:16:33,870
Right, let's go first.

494
00:16:35,420 --> 00:16:36,589
(Team Jong Kook is also going.)

495
00:16:36,590 --> 00:16:39,115
Is there anyone who'd swap with me?

496
00:16:39,220 --> 00:16:43,200
(Haha is reminded of someone.)

497
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:45,559
Hello?

498
00:16:45,560 --> 00:16:46,699
(The receiver has been sleeping.)

499
00:16:46,700 --> 00:16:47,741
Sang Yeob.

500
00:16:48,271 --> 00:16:50,140
(It's Lee Sang Yeob, a regular on this show.)

501
00:16:50,141 --> 00:16:51,180
- Are you alive? - Hi.

502
00:16:51,501 --> 00:16:53,459
- You're our substitute man. - Are you with So Min?

503
00:16:53,511 --> 00:16:55,770
- I'm your substitute man! - Yes, you are!

504
00:16:55,771 --> 00:16:57,910
(He is called the substitute man.)

505
00:16:57,911 --> 00:17:00,679
(The substitute man is a new character on the show.)

506
00:17:00,680 --> 00:17:03,719
(He's known to substitute for all painful penalties.)

507
00:17:03,720 --> 00:17:07,189
Do you have any items that aren't cheap...

508
00:17:07,190 --> 00:17:09,878
but that you want to throw away?

509
00:17:09,950 --> 00:17:12,560
It'd be nice if you give us some nice items since...

510
00:17:12,561 --> 00:17:15,489
- we can only call three people. - He's right.

511
00:17:15,930 --> 00:17:17,660
(He hints So Min to help.)

512
00:17:17,661 --> 00:17:20,458
- We called you first. - That's right.

513
00:17:20,801 --> 00:17:22,346
- Then... - Yes?

514
00:17:22,571 --> 00:17:23,840
I do have a good one.

515
00:17:23,841 --> 00:17:24,900
- Really? - Really?

516
00:17:24,901 --> 00:17:26,070
- Sang Yeob. - Okay!

517
00:17:26,071 --> 00:17:27,739
- This is your time... - Right.

518
00:17:27,740 --> 00:17:29,992
to show us how much you're worth.

519
00:17:30,210 --> 00:17:31,679
- Let's do it! - Okay!

520
00:17:31,680 --> 00:17:33,009
2019!

521
00:17:33,010 --> 00:17:34,009
(He asks So Min to help once more.)

522
00:17:34,010 --> 00:17:35,279
- World star! - The rising star of variety shows!

523
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:37,372
(They fail to be in sync.)

524
00:17:37,720 --> 00:17:39,467
- Once more. 2019! - 2019!

525
00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:41,265
- The rising star of variety shows! - The rising star of variety shows!

526
00:17:41,821 --> 00:17:44,790
- Lee Sang Yeob! - Lee Sang Yeob!

527
00:17:44,791 --> 00:17:47,517
(They praise him.)

528
00:17:47,690 --> 00:17:49,075
We love you, substitute man!

529
00:17:49,131 --> 00:17:51,019
Give us your address!

530
00:17:52,331 --> 00:17:53,529
(Meanwhile, where is Team Jae Seok?)

531
00:17:53,530 --> 00:17:55,370
Gosh, this is insane.

532
00:17:55,371 --> 00:17:56,499
I had no idea it'd be like this.

533
00:17:56,500 --> 00:17:58,239
(They haven't departed yet.)

534
00:17:58,240 --> 00:18:01,342
(Kwang Soo gets in first.)

535
00:18:03,480 --> 00:18:04,610
I don't know if it'll fit.

536
00:18:04,611 --> 00:18:06,458
(It's taking ages.)

537
00:18:07,210 --> 00:18:08,260
First...

538
00:18:08,811 --> 00:18:10,841
- Let's... - What is this?

539
00:18:11,750 --> 00:18:12,820
Your guitar.

540
00:18:12,821 --> 00:18:14,234
If that breaks, we're done for.

541
00:18:14,490 --> 00:18:16,470
- Be careful. - Okay.

542
00:18:16,651 --> 00:18:18,105
How do we do this?

543
00:18:18,821 --> 00:18:19,820
Goodness.

544
00:18:19,821 --> 00:18:21,429
(They're going through so much turmoil.)

545
00:18:21,430 --> 00:18:23,926
All right. Can you take us...

546
00:18:25,101 --> 00:18:27,453
to Hwanghak-dong?

547
00:18:28,101 --> 00:18:30,600
(Hwanghak-dong is known for its flea market.)

548
00:18:30,601 --> 00:18:34,681
(It's a treasure chest full of everything you can imagine.)

549
00:18:34,770 --> 00:18:37,032
Why did you bring this?

550
00:18:37,081 --> 00:18:38,152
Gosh.

551
00:18:38,641 --> 00:18:40,570
Did you really have to?

552
00:18:42,180 --> 00:18:43,580
I had no idea.

553
00:18:43,581 --> 00:18:46,146
If I knew better, I would've brought something else.

554
00:18:46,250 --> 00:18:48,311
Who'd buy yours?

555
00:18:48,420 --> 00:18:52,258
Sir, do you have any intention of buying this cut-out?

556
00:18:52,561 --> 00:18:53,944
Not in particular.

557
00:18:55,430 --> 00:18:57,248
Would you buy it for 50 cents?

558
00:18:57,430 --> 00:18:58,916
Well...

559
00:18:58,930 --> 00:19:00,229
I wouldn't buy it for 10 cents.

560
00:19:00,230 --> 00:19:02,830
(He's being honest.)

561
00:19:02,831 --> 00:19:04,239
(Only valuable items are worth selling.)

562
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:05,250
That hurt.

563
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:07,910
- I know what he means. - He was very...

564
00:19:07,911 --> 00:19:09,153
- He wouldn't buy it for 10 cents. - straightforward.

565
00:19:09,210 --> 00:19:11,735
- But I agree with him. - How could he?

566
00:19:11,811 --> 00:19:13,749
For someone who doesn't need this,

567
00:19:13,750 --> 00:19:15,569
this will be nothing but trash.

568
00:19:15,911 --> 00:19:18,080
All right. Let's just go to the flea market...

569
00:19:18,081 --> 00:19:19,949
- and find out its worth. - Okay.

570
00:19:19,950 --> 00:19:22,041
Okay? Let's go first.

571
00:19:22,651 --> 00:19:26,156
(They arrive in Hwanghak-dong's kitchen alley.)

572
00:19:26,591 --> 00:19:28,509
By the way...

573
00:19:29,891 --> 00:19:31,959
(They're lost.)

574
00:19:31,960 --> 00:19:33,112
No one will buy this.

575
00:19:33,801 --> 00:19:34,800
(No one in this kitchen alley will buy his item.)

576
00:19:34,801 --> 00:19:37,366
They sell kitchen utilities.

577
00:19:37,571 --> 00:19:39,157
I doubt anyone would buy this.

578
00:19:39,871 --> 00:19:41,509
- Hello. - Hello.

579
00:19:41,510 --> 00:19:42,939
- Hello. - Where are you going?

580
00:19:42,940 --> 00:19:44,179
(Let's see.)

581
00:19:44,180 --> 00:19:45,322
How about exchanging that with this basket?

582
00:19:46,740 --> 00:19:48,350
This is worth more than that.

583
00:19:48,351 --> 00:19:49,461
- What? - I'll give it for free.

584
00:19:49,581 --> 00:19:51,779
- But still. - Take it.

585
00:19:51,780 --> 00:19:53,194
(She's willing to give it for free.)

586
00:19:53,381 --> 00:19:56,886
- Ma'am, do you perhaps need this? - Ma'am.

587
00:19:57,220 --> 00:19:58,790
- That cut-out? - Yes.

588
00:19:58,791 --> 00:20:00,330
- No, I don't. - Okay.

589
00:20:00,331 --> 00:20:02,060
Do you want me to place it there and advertise it?

590
00:20:02,061 --> 00:20:04,830
(She asks if he needs help with his own PR.)

591
00:20:04,831 --> 00:20:06,719
No, that's not why.

592
00:20:06,970 --> 00:20:08,429
I don't need that.

593
00:20:08,430 --> 00:20:10,499
(She can set it up, but it's still not worth buying.)

594
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:12,117
I don't need that.

595
00:20:12,901 --> 00:20:15,439
We'll come back later if we need your help.

596
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:16,450
Thank you.

597
00:20:16,670 --> 00:20:18,528
- I can't believe she offered that. - See?

598
00:20:19,081 --> 00:20:22,110
- It's really of no use. - Don't say that.

599
00:20:22,111 --> 00:20:23,463
You heard her, right?

600
00:20:23,720 --> 00:20:25,600
She offered to advertise it for you.

601
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:28,439
Like what our driver said,

602
00:20:29,190 --> 00:20:30,560
it's not even worth 10 cents.

603
00:20:30,561 --> 00:20:31,701
That's not true.

604
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:33,090
- That can't be. - I'm frustrated.

605
00:20:33,091 --> 00:20:34,303
- Hello. - Hello.

606
00:20:34,361 --> 00:20:35,946
- Hello. - Hello.

607
00:20:36,230 --> 00:20:37,959
Goodness.

608
00:20:37,960 --> 00:20:39,160
(They arrive at a market.)

609
00:20:39,161 --> 00:20:40,817
Look at that.

610
00:20:40,930 --> 00:20:42,213
They might need it.

611
00:20:42,631 --> 00:20:45,570
Look at this. They have everything.

612
00:20:45,571 --> 00:20:46,914
(They have many cheap used goods.)

613
00:20:48,341 --> 00:20:50,603
- Goodness. Hello. - Hello.

614
00:20:51,381 --> 00:20:52,410
Why are you carrying that?

615
00:20:52,411 --> 00:20:54,198
- Why? - We'll sell it.

616
00:20:54,551 --> 00:20:56,580
(A lady becomes interested.)

617
00:20:56,581 --> 00:20:59,080
- We'd like to exchange this. - We're going to swap.

618
00:20:59,081 --> 00:21:01,716
Because we have a mission today.

619
00:21:01,950 --> 00:21:04,320
Would you be interested in setting this up...

620
00:21:04,321 --> 00:21:05,560
in front of your store?

621
00:21:05,561 --> 00:21:08,060
Since many tourists visit here...

622
00:21:08,061 --> 00:21:10,729
How much do you think this should be?

623
00:21:10,730 --> 00:21:12,852
- This cut-out? - Yes.

624
00:21:14,331 --> 00:21:20,969
(How much is this 2m-tall cut-out worth at this market?)

625
00:21:20,970 --> 00:21:23,070
The highest would be two dollars.

626
00:21:23,071 --> 00:21:24,091
Two dollars?

627
00:21:24,541 --> 00:21:27,479
(She'll offer 2 dollars at most.)

628
00:21:27,811 --> 00:21:30,719
- Two dollars? - Yes, then I'll be able to sell it.

629
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:32,367
- 2 dollars? - 2 dollars.

630
00:21:32,420 --> 00:21:34,550
- Okay, we'll be back. - Okay.

631
00:21:34,551 --> 00:21:36,439
- We'll be back. Thank you. - Two dollars?

632
00:21:36,591 --> 00:21:39,187
- Two dollars. - I won't sell it for that price.

633
00:21:39,591 --> 00:21:40,590
(He expects it to be more expensive.)

634
00:21:40,591 --> 00:21:42,348
I would've sold it for 30 dollars.

635
00:21:42,460 --> 00:21:45,561
It's worth two dollars as of now.

636
00:21:47,101 --> 00:21:49,019
They're shooting that show today.

637
00:21:49,101 --> 00:21:51,221
"The Show". It's a music program.

638
00:21:51,270 --> 00:21:52,870
(Which idol groups are present?)

639
00:21:52,871 --> 00:21:54,931
Seok Jin, look here. It's SF9.

640
00:21:56,111 --> 00:21:58,110
(SF9 has caught Se Chan's eye.)

641
00:21:58,111 --> 00:22:01,009
(SF9 is a group of 9 talented members.)

642
00:22:01,010 --> 00:22:05,060
(SF9 has been appearing on dramas and variety shows.)

643
00:22:05,081 --> 00:22:06,899
This is SF9. Wow.

644
00:22:06,950 --> 00:22:08,689
Please introduce yourselves.

645
00:22:08,690 --> 00:22:10,235
Okay. 2, 3.

646
00:22:10,291 --> 00:22:12,209
- To be a sensation. Hi, we're SF9. - To be a sensation. Hi, we're SF9.

647
00:22:12,490 --> 00:22:13,742
They're amazing.

648
00:22:13,791 --> 00:22:15,649
He was in "Sky Castle".

649
00:22:15,690 --> 00:22:16,989
He played the role of Woo Ju.

650
00:22:16,990 --> 00:22:18,647
- We loved the drama. - Thank you.

651
00:22:18,730 --> 00:22:20,870
I made sure to watch it every week.

652
00:22:20,871 --> 00:22:22,183
It was so good.

653
00:22:22,230 --> 00:22:24,189
It's nice to meet you. We're here...

654
00:22:24,500 --> 00:22:25,682
because...

655
00:22:26,500 --> 00:22:28,140
Take out your items.

656
00:22:28,141 --> 00:22:30,439
(He tells them to take out their items.)

657
00:22:30,440 --> 00:22:33,138
- All right. - We have quite a bit of stuff.

658
00:22:33,180 --> 00:22:34,810
- Hold on. - Which one should we do first?

659
00:22:34,811 --> 00:22:36,769
- Should we go with the pants? - Sure.

660
00:22:36,881 --> 00:22:38,719
All right. Check out these pants.

661
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:40,790
(He starts off confidently.)

662
00:22:40,791 --> 00:22:42,120
(They're not too excited.)

663
00:22:42,121 --> 00:22:43,919
Any one of you can wear them.

664
00:22:43,920 --> 00:22:45,273
- Goodness. - They're vintage.

665
00:22:45,420 --> 00:22:46,689
- Sorry? - They're vintage goods.

666
00:22:46,690 --> 00:22:47,929
- What? - Not at all.

667
00:22:47,930 --> 00:22:51,263
You may think that way, but it's a popular brand.

668
00:22:51,530 --> 00:22:53,969
It's not worn out. This is how it should look like.

669
00:22:53,970 --> 00:22:55,300
Chani, you'll look good in them.

670
00:22:55,301 --> 00:22:58,499
Do you want to try them on?

671
00:22:58,500 --> 00:22:59,540
(That?)

672
00:22:59,541 --> 00:23:01,040
- Just try them. - Wear them over yours.

673
00:23:01,041 --> 00:23:02,939
- Over mine? - Yes, try it.

674
00:23:02,940 --> 00:23:06,072
- My size is 29. - This is 30. It'll fit. Try them.

675
00:23:06,111 --> 00:23:08,978
Sizes 28 to 32 will all fit.

676
00:23:09,010 --> 00:23:10,020
Anyone can wear them.

677
00:23:10,280 --> 00:23:12,650
- I knew it. - It fits just right.

678
00:23:12,651 --> 00:23:15,449
(He looks good in them.)

679
00:23:15,450 --> 00:23:17,410
- You really do look good in them. - He's right.

680
00:23:17,460 --> 00:23:19,238
- It's like a stage outfit. - I'm not joking.

681
00:23:20,121 --> 00:23:22,281
You can wear them on stage. Just tighten the back.

682
00:23:22,891 --> 00:23:23,911
And...

683
00:23:24,631 --> 00:23:26,529
- Where is the jacket? - They're pretty.

684
00:23:26,530 --> 00:23:27,742
- Where is the jacket? - I'm wearing it.

685
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,687
- Oh, my. - Look at him.

686
00:23:30,230 --> 00:23:31,239
(Rowoon looks good in it.)

687
00:23:31,240 --> 00:23:32,800
Look at this.

688
00:23:32,801 --> 00:23:34,790
- Stand next to Chani. - That's the same jacket?

689
00:23:35,170 --> 00:23:36,669
It's the same jacket.

690
00:23:36,670 --> 00:23:39,540
(Rowoon makes it look better.)

691
00:23:39,541 --> 00:23:41,732
- They look so good. - It suits them.

692
00:23:41,881 --> 00:23:43,526
They make the clothes look better.

693
00:23:43,611 --> 00:23:45,820
Your stylist looks shocked.

694
00:23:45,821 --> 00:23:47,919
These clothes are better than her picks.

695
00:23:47,920 --> 00:23:49,708
(He tries to persuade them.)

696
00:23:50,391 --> 00:23:52,713
She feels like she needs to try harder.

697
00:23:53,190 --> 00:23:54,676
Do you have anything you can exchange them for?

698
00:23:54,730 --> 00:23:55,770
I do.

699
00:23:56,131 --> 00:23:57,160
I have a bluetooth speaker.

700
00:23:57,161 --> 00:23:59,383
- Really? - Seriously?

701
00:24:00,131 --> 00:24:02,100
- We've been using it. - Really?

702
00:24:02,101 --> 00:24:03,919
I can't believe it.

703
00:24:04,341 --> 00:24:06,826
Hold on. How much was this?

704
00:24:06,871 --> 00:24:09,233
- I'm not sure. - Roughly?

705
00:24:09,270 --> 00:24:11,310
But I'm sure it wasn't too expensive.

706
00:24:11,311 --> 00:24:12,479
Really?

707
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:14,370
Then I think you should take that off.

708
00:24:15,280 --> 00:24:17,502
(He won't sell the jacket.)

709
00:24:17,750 --> 00:24:19,179
- Seok Jin. - This jacket is worth a lot.

710
00:24:19,180 --> 00:24:21,676
- No way. - We need to sell it to him.

711
00:24:21,791 --> 00:24:23,489
- Not many people like it. - I can't!

712
00:24:23,490 --> 00:24:24,905
Most people don't like it.

713
00:24:25,020 --> 00:24:27,040
- Let's take back the pants then. - No.

714
00:24:27,091 --> 00:24:30,459
It's rare to find someone who looks good in them.

715
00:24:30,460 --> 00:24:32,060
They were so expensive.

716
00:24:32,061 --> 00:24:34,400
- It's rare, you know? - That's true.

717
00:24:34,401 --> 00:24:36,088
- Do you want these? - What?

718
00:24:36,770 --> 00:24:39,265
- This is really good. - It's a gift from us.

719
00:24:39,341 --> 00:24:41,340
Can you give us one more?

720
00:24:41,341 --> 00:24:43,188
- Is that a shaver? - It is.

721
00:24:43,311 --> 00:24:45,027
- What is this? - It's perfume.

722
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:46,521
Thank you.

723
00:24:46,641 --> 00:24:49,150
- Thank you. - Good luck, SF9!

724
00:24:49,151 --> 00:24:50,550
Good luck with your performance.

725
00:24:50,551 --> 00:24:51,580
- You can do it. - You can do it.

726
00:24:51,581 --> 00:24:53,080
You guys really look good.

727
00:24:53,081 --> 00:24:54,333
(They exchange the clothes with the members' belongings.)

728
00:24:54,891 --> 00:24:56,940
- I wonder what he'll bring. - I'm so curious.

729
00:24:56,990 --> 00:24:58,120
- I'm anticipating. - He's here!

730
00:24:58,121 --> 00:24:59,719
(They haven't seen him in a while.)

731
00:24:59,720 --> 00:25:02,290
Come in. What is that?

732
00:25:02,291 --> 00:25:03,946
(What did Sang Yeob bring?)

733
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:08,405
(Lee Sang Yeob, also known as the substitute man)

734
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:11,122
What have you brought?

735
00:25:11,401 --> 00:25:12,400
(What's in your hands?)

736
00:25:12,401 --> 00:25:14,540
- Hey, what is that? - What is that?

737
00:25:14,541 --> 00:25:16,489
- Isn't that a monitor? - What is that?

738
00:25:16,541 --> 00:25:18,701
Isn't that an antique?

739
00:25:18,940 --> 00:25:21,249
- Hey. - What is that?

740
00:25:21,250 --> 00:25:23,179
- It's heavy. - It's a very old item.

741
00:25:23,180 --> 00:25:24,820
It's our family heirloom.

742
00:25:24,821 --> 00:25:26,449
- This is good. - I like this one.

743
00:25:26,450 --> 00:25:27,935
How could you bring your family heirloom?

744
00:25:29,551 --> 00:25:33,631
(At a glance, you can see that it's a very old item.)

745
00:25:33,791 --> 00:25:37,062
(It's the oldest vintage item so far.)

746
00:25:37,260 --> 00:25:38,947
This is amazing.

747
00:25:39,301 --> 00:25:40,785
It's our family heirloom.

748
00:25:41,301 --> 00:25:43,429
If my parents find out, they'll kick me out.

749
00:25:43,430 --> 00:25:45,070
This could be several centuries old.

750
00:25:45,071 --> 00:25:46,469
Shouldn't this be placed in a museum?

751
00:25:46,470 --> 00:25:48,939
You're right. It's pretty much a national treasure.

752
00:25:48,940 --> 00:25:51,279
- What is this used for? - I don't know.

753
00:25:51,280 --> 00:25:52,957
- How do you use this? - What is this?

754
00:25:53,111 --> 00:25:55,410
- What is this? - This is used...

755
00:25:55,411 --> 00:25:57,228
as a heater.

756
00:25:58,351 --> 00:26:02,593
(Is it a brazier that was used to warm their bodies?)

757
00:26:02,821 --> 00:26:04,259
- You use those chopsticks. - You put charcoal in this.

758
00:26:04,260 --> 00:26:07,060
- You move it with the chopsticks. - That's correct.

759
00:26:07,061 --> 00:26:08,790
The reason why I brought this was because...

760
00:26:08,791 --> 00:26:10,630
- I wanted to know how much it was. - Right, you must be curious.

761
00:26:10,631 --> 00:26:12,259
- I am. - Do you like paintings?

762
00:26:12,260 --> 00:26:14,499
(She gets ready to sell their items.)

763
00:26:14,500 --> 00:26:15,844
- Paintings? All of a sudden? - Yes.

764
00:26:15,901 --> 00:26:17,800
We should give you something in return.

765
00:26:17,801 --> 00:26:19,214
This is an exchange.

766
00:26:19,270 --> 00:26:21,765
(You're going to give me a painting?)

767
00:26:22,740 --> 00:26:23,923
Do you feel lonely these days?

768
00:26:24,041 --> 00:26:25,610
How do you feel these days? We have several paintings.

769
00:26:25,611 --> 00:26:27,279
We have paintings for all moods.

770
00:26:27,280 --> 00:26:29,574
- I am lonely. - They're like talismans.

771
00:26:29,611 --> 00:26:31,650
We have paintings that bring someone helpful into your life,

772
00:26:31,651 --> 00:26:34,620
make you rich, or make you fall in love.

773
00:26:34,621 --> 00:26:37,176
There's also one that brings you peace.

774
00:26:37,220 --> 00:26:38,270
I'd like...

775
00:26:38,821 --> 00:26:39,902
a helpful person to come into my life.

776
00:26:39,960 --> 00:26:41,607
- A helpful person? Hold on. - Helpful person?

777
00:26:41,861 --> 00:26:43,590
- So Min. - Yes.

778
00:26:43,591 --> 00:26:44,759
Oh, really?

779
00:26:44,760 --> 00:26:46,199
(Let's see.)

780
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:47,199
That one.

781
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:48,529
(Ta-da)

782
00:26:48,530 --> 00:26:49,782
(Haha encourages him on.)

783
00:26:50,530 --> 00:26:53,196
- This one is quite nice. - What is this? "So Min"?

784
00:26:53,901 --> 00:26:56,410
- I painted it. - It's nice.

785
00:26:56,411 --> 00:26:58,057
- Isn't it nice? - Isn't this one too pricey?

786
00:26:58,141 --> 00:27:00,110
Still, he said he's lonely.

787
00:27:00,111 --> 00:27:02,910
(They talk as if her painting is worth just as much...)

788
00:27:02,911 --> 00:27:04,150
(as Sang Yeob's brazier.)

789
00:27:04,151 --> 00:27:06,179
But still, I think the painting is worth far more.

790
00:27:06,180 --> 00:27:07,850
- Right? - From what I've heard,

791
00:27:07,851 --> 00:27:10,315
she had a great love life when she had this painting.

792
00:27:10,351 --> 00:27:12,784
- Really? - It's truly a talisman.

793
00:27:13,161 --> 00:27:14,343
It is.

794
00:27:15,591 --> 00:27:17,246
And she's giving it to you. It's amazing.

795
00:27:17,291 --> 00:27:20,361
That's right. And a celebrity drew that, you see.

796
00:27:20,460 --> 00:27:22,929
I know that you guys fell in love in the drama.

797
00:27:22,930 --> 00:27:25,370
But in real life, do you really not feel anything for each other?

798
00:27:25,371 --> 00:27:26,439
We're just doing business.

799
00:27:26,440 --> 00:27:28,187
- Nothing at all? - It's just business.

800
00:27:28,341 --> 00:27:29,669
- It's just business. - Really? Nothing at all?

801
00:27:29,670 --> 00:27:30,720
We're like family.

802
00:27:30,811 --> 00:27:32,810
But I was slightly disappointed last time.

803
00:27:32,811 --> 00:27:34,669
She said that she and I were like family,

804
00:27:34,980 --> 00:27:36,679
and I could totally understand that.

805
00:27:36,680 --> 00:27:38,749
(She was asked if there was an actor she fell for recently.)

806
00:27:38,750 --> 00:27:40,367
(She said it was Kim Ji Suk.)

807
00:27:41,190 --> 00:27:42,949
(Isn't Sang Yeob in that drama too?)

808
00:27:42,950 --> 00:27:44,233
But for him...

809
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:46,290
(He's like family to me.)

810
00:27:46,291 --> 00:27:48,109
(Her reply was very brief.)

811
00:27:48,861 --> 00:27:50,981
Is there absolutely no way for you two to be dating?

812
00:27:51,131 --> 00:27:53,323
- Not at all. - She said we're like family.

813
00:27:53,430 --> 00:27:54,630
Sang Yeob seems to be disappointed.

814
00:27:54,631 --> 00:27:57,054
I'm not his style to begin with.

815
00:27:57,401 --> 00:27:59,188
- Really? - Whenever I say something,

816
00:27:59,371 --> 00:28:02,804
he says, "How could you say that as a woman?"

817
00:28:03,210 --> 00:28:06,472
("So Min, don't say such things!")

818
00:28:06,680 --> 00:28:07,850
He's the pure type.

819
00:28:07,851 --> 00:28:09,769
He's very pure.

820
00:28:10,250 --> 00:28:11,880
- He's very naive. - I see.

821
00:28:11,881 --> 00:28:13,479
- That's what makes him interesting. - Is he conservative?

822
00:28:13,480 --> 00:28:15,350
- Very. - Really?

823
00:28:15,351 --> 00:28:17,860
- Hey, no wonder. - You're right.

824
00:28:17,861 --> 00:28:18,890
(No wonder)

825
00:28:18,891 --> 00:28:21,790
(The item he brought seemed very conservative.)

826
00:28:21,791 --> 00:28:24,729
- It's our family heirloom. - Okay, we got it.

827
00:28:25,030 --> 00:28:26,060
Okay.

828
00:28:26,061 --> 00:28:27,929
- We understand. - That's conservative?

829
00:28:27,930 --> 00:28:29,921
He's very conservative.

830
00:28:30,071 --> 00:28:31,959
I finally found out my true personality.

831
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:34,040
- He's conservative. - He is.

832
00:28:34,041 --> 00:28:36,262
- He's conservative. - You're right.

833
00:28:36,641 --> 00:28:37,690
I had no idea.

834
00:28:37,911 --> 00:28:41,243
(So Min exchanges her painting with Sang Yeob's heirloom.)

835
00:28:41,911 --> 00:28:42,979
(Where are Jae Seok and Kwang Soo...)

836
00:28:42,980 --> 00:28:44,120
I feel helpless.

837
00:28:44,121 --> 00:28:45,620
(while the others are succeeding?)

838
00:28:45,621 --> 00:28:47,620
(They haven't been able to do much.)

839
00:28:47,621 --> 00:28:48,933
I'm going crazy. What should we do?

840
00:28:49,420 --> 00:28:52,551
(They've been wandering the streets for 30 minutes now.)

841
00:28:54,131 --> 00:28:56,029
I don't think anyone would buy yours.

842
00:28:56,030 --> 00:28:57,344
- Well... - I'm serious.

843
00:28:57,960 --> 00:28:59,212
I'm so embarrassed.

844
00:28:59,730 --> 00:29:02,428
(Suddenly)

845
00:29:03,500 --> 00:29:04,939
- Hello. - Hello.

846
00:29:04,940 --> 00:29:06,820
- It's a record store. - It's an LP store.

847
00:29:06,940 --> 00:29:08,960
(An LP store catches their attention.)

848
00:29:09,541 --> 00:29:12,167
It's an LP store. An old record store.

849
00:29:12,381 --> 00:29:14,350
That's Michael Jackson's old record.

850
00:29:14,351 --> 00:29:16,350
(This vintage store has many old records.)

851
00:29:16,351 --> 00:29:17,966
This is amazing.

852
00:29:18,450 --> 00:29:19,895
May we enter? Thank you.

853
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:22,812
If we exchange ours with these records, it'll be pricey.

854
00:29:22,920 --> 00:29:26,426
LP stores are popular among young people these days.

855
00:29:26,821 --> 00:29:28,306
- Hello. - Hello.

856
00:29:28,430 --> 00:29:30,653
- I was so startled. - Hello.

857
00:29:31,131 --> 00:29:33,786
You'd rather come here than stream songs online?

858
00:29:33,831 --> 00:29:35,951
It's my hobby.

859
00:29:36,230 --> 00:29:38,260
- Listening to LP records? - Yes.

860
00:29:38,500 --> 00:29:39,954
It's vintage.

861
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:42,669
They are examples of new-tro.

862
00:29:42,670 --> 00:29:45,033
- You're right. - We need to exchange something.

863
00:29:45,141 --> 00:29:47,301
Do you happen to need Kwang Soo's cut-out?

864
00:29:47,780 --> 00:29:50,305
Jae Seok, don't say that.

865
00:29:50,710 --> 00:29:52,350
(He didn't need to point out that it was Kwang Soo's.)

866
00:29:52,351 --> 00:29:54,919
You can just say that it's a cut-out.

867
00:29:54,920 --> 00:29:56,989
- It's my cut-out. - Our mission is...

868
00:29:56,990 --> 00:30:00,660
to exchange our items.

869
00:30:00,661 --> 00:30:02,429
Do you need his cut-out?

870
00:30:02,430 --> 00:30:04,060
(He asks them.)

871
00:30:04,061 --> 00:30:10,669
(Kwang Soo is known as the Asian Prince.)

872
00:30:10,670 --> 00:30:12,540
(Is she a fan of his as well?)

873
00:30:12,541 --> 00:30:13,540
No, thanks.

874
00:30:13,541 --> 00:30:15,834
(She rejects.)

875
00:30:16,041 --> 00:30:17,709
- Okay. - You don't need it.

876
00:30:17,710 --> 00:30:19,155
It was too sudden.

877
00:30:19,311 --> 00:30:20,654
Right. How old are you?

878
00:30:23,180 --> 00:30:24,850
(He asks them their age.)

879
00:30:24,851 --> 00:30:25,961
Why would you ask that?

880
00:30:26,450 --> 00:30:27,749
(Flustered)

881
00:30:27,750 --> 00:30:29,337
- Why would you ask that? - We're 18.

882
00:30:29,391 --> 00:30:31,208
You were born in 2002.

883
00:30:31,591 --> 00:30:33,790
You're so young, but you're listening to LP records.

884
00:30:33,791 --> 00:30:35,749
Anyway, you can enjoy listening.

885
00:30:35,831 --> 00:30:37,779
We need to talk to the owner.

886
00:30:38,030 --> 00:30:39,429
- Hello, sir. - Hello.

887
00:30:39,430 --> 00:30:41,187
- Hello, I'm Lee Kwang Soo. - Hello.

888
00:30:43,131 --> 00:30:45,540
We came here to exchange this cut-out...

889
00:30:45,541 --> 00:30:47,709
- with an item of yours. - My daughter is a big fan.

890
00:30:47,710 --> 00:30:48,883
Really?

891
00:30:49,071 --> 00:30:51,464
(His daughter is a big fan of Kwang Soo's.)

892
00:30:51,881 --> 00:30:53,410
- Seriously? - She loves him.

893
00:30:53,411 --> 00:30:54,763
- Thank you. - How old is she?

894
00:30:54,881 --> 00:30:55,891
She's in fourth grade.

895
00:30:55,950 --> 00:30:58,202
She only watches Running Man at home.

896
00:30:59,250 --> 00:31:01,290
My goodness.

897
00:31:01,291 --> 00:31:02,749
How much would you pay for this?

898
00:31:02,750 --> 00:31:06,660
(How much is his cut-out worth?)

899
00:31:06,661 --> 00:31:07,943
Since my daughter likes it,

900
00:31:08,831 --> 00:31:10,830
- I'll pay 50 dollars. - My goodness!

901
00:31:10,831 --> 00:31:13,029
(He's the highest bidder thus far.)

902
00:31:13,030 --> 00:31:14,600
It's too expensive.

903
00:31:14,601 --> 00:31:15,969
I could've actually given you a higher price.

904
00:31:15,970 --> 00:31:17,669
- 50 dollars is more than enough. - Thank you.

905
00:31:17,670 --> 00:31:19,469
- This is... - Do I pay you in money?

906
00:31:19,470 --> 00:31:21,169
There's only one of this in the world.

907
00:31:21,170 --> 00:31:22,958
There will never be a duplicate.

908
00:31:23,710 --> 00:31:26,040
- 50 dollars is too expensive. - Really?

909
00:31:26,041 --> 00:31:27,949
(Jae Seok stops him.)

910
00:31:27,950 --> 00:31:29,495
What kind of cut-out is worth 50 dollars?

911
00:31:30,450 --> 00:31:32,550
Is there a belonging of yours that you'd exchange with this?

912
00:31:32,551 --> 00:31:35,090
- Do you have any? - Then how about this?

913
00:31:35,091 --> 00:31:36,489
It's a bit old,

914
00:31:36,490 --> 00:31:38,390
but the Academy Awards ended recently.

915
00:31:38,391 --> 00:31:41,060
I have LP records of the "Bohemian Rhapsody".

916
00:31:41,061 --> 00:31:42,429
- Are you serious? - Yes.

917
00:31:42,430 --> 00:31:43,959
- It's not easy to get those. - Seriously?

918
00:31:43,960 --> 00:31:45,515
- Freddie Mercury? - Yes.

919
00:31:45,831 --> 00:31:48,729
- Can you show us? - How much do you sell those for?

920
00:31:49,030 --> 00:31:51,797
It's worth more than 50 dollars.

921
00:31:52,470 --> 00:31:54,709
I heard it's extremely difficult to find those these days.

922
00:31:54,710 --> 00:31:56,962
(He willingly offers it for his daughter.)

923
00:31:57,680 --> 00:32:00,771
- Isn't it too expensive? - Queen is on the rise.

924
00:32:01,151 --> 00:32:02,910
(They're in awe.)

925
00:32:02,911 --> 00:32:04,263
This is so rare.

926
00:32:04,651 --> 00:32:07,276
I had actually looked for one.

927
00:32:07,321 --> 00:32:08,836
It was so hard to get one.

928
00:32:09,091 --> 00:32:11,489
Since my daughter likes you, I can offer you that.

929
00:32:11,490 --> 00:32:13,620
But still, how could you exchange this with his cut-out?

930
00:32:13,621 --> 00:32:15,959
(Jae Seok still can't understand.)

931
00:32:15,960 --> 00:32:16,989
Come on.

932
00:32:16,990 --> 00:32:19,360
Don't say that.

933
00:32:19,361 --> 00:32:21,370
- That's true. - Stop saying that.

934
00:32:21,371 --> 00:32:23,029
You're really going to exchange this with that?

935
00:32:23,030 --> 00:32:24,040
(Trading Kwang Soo's cut-out is successful.)

936
00:32:24,601 --> 00:32:25,600
Thank you so much.

937
00:32:25,601 --> 00:32:27,621
This is unbelievable.

938
00:32:30,141 --> 00:32:31,840
Should we try using it here?

939
00:32:31,841 --> 00:32:33,739
We came here to use it.

940
00:32:33,740 --> 00:32:35,209
- Let's try it. - We should.

941
00:32:35,210 --> 00:32:36,979
We need to show a demonstration first.

942
00:32:36,980 --> 00:32:38,395
- I need to see if it has fuel. - Our clients.

943
00:32:39,051 --> 00:32:40,150
They're here.

944
00:32:40,151 --> 00:32:41,261
(They're finally here.)

945
00:32:42,391 --> 00:32:43,519
- They're coming. - Hey.

946
00:32:43,520 --> 00:32:45,090
(Who's the savior that came without knowing the trading item?)

947
00:32:45,091 --> 00:32:46,333
Hello.

948
00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:47,842
- Hello. - Come here.

949
00:32:47,891 --> 00:32:49,360
(Eating coach, Moon Se Yoon)

950
00:32:49,361 --> 00:32:50,644
(Indispensable man, Choi Seong Min)

951
00:32:51,260 --> 00:32:52,759
(Se Yoon and Seong Min,)

952
00:32:52,760 --> 00:32:56,568
(funny next door colleagues that Se Chan invited.)

953
00:32:56,930 --> 00:32:58,739
- We are... - Can you explain it to them?

954
00:32:58,740 --> 00:33:00,215
- What is this? - Well, this is...

955
00:33:00,270 --> 00:33:01,957
Would you like to see our item?

956
00:33:02,010 --> 00:33:03,070
Okay, let's see your item.

957
00:33:03,071 --> 00:33:04,540
- Are we trading with it? - Take it out.

958
00:33:04,541 --> 00:33:05,994
- The bigger one first? - Yes, the bigger one.

959
00:33:06,240 --> 00:33:07,392
- The bigger one. - Can we reject it?

960
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:08,965
Just have a look at it first.

961
00:33:09,010 --> 00:33:10,364
- Here we go. - We...

962
00:33:10,551 --> 00:33:12,550
(A flame weeder enters without a chance to reject it.)

963
00:33:12,551 --> 00:33:13,591
What is this?

964
00:33:13,651 --> 00:33:15,034
- Here we go. - We...

965
00:33:15,151 --> 00:33:16,719
- What is this? - We have more than one item.

966
00:33:16,720 --> 00:33:18,105
- Is this a bazooka? - No.

967
00:33:18,891 --> 00:33:19,890
What is it?

968
00:33:19,891 --> 00:33:21,630
Don't you like camping with your children?

969
00:33:21,631 --> 00:33:24,691
- Right. - When you're cooking the meat...

970
00:33:24,760 --> 00:33:26,029
as their father...

971
00:33:26,030 --> 00:33:28,499
"Kids, I'll show you a magic."

972
00:33:28,500 --> 00:33:30,100
(Your dad will cook the meat with a flame weeder.)

973
00:33:30,101 --> 00:33:31,818
The meat will be cooked straightaway.

974
00:33:32,240 --> 00:33:34,189
- This... - This is really good.

975
00:33:34,240 --> 00:33:37,410
This is going to cook a whole farm.

976
00:33:37,411 --> 00:33:39,509
- No. - No, but this...

977
00:33:39,510 --> 00:33:40,793
- With this... - We will...

978
00:33:41,151 --> 00:33:42,666
- show you how strong the flame is. - We will show you.

979
00:33:42,811 --> 00:33:44,650
- But... - This is locked.

980
00:33:44,651 --> 00:33:46,771
Am I allowed to reject this offer?

981
00:33:46,950 --> 00:33:48,890
- Have a look first. - Yes, have a look.

982
00:33:48,891 --> 00:33:50,719
- How do you work this? - Well...

983
00:33:50,720 --> 00:33:52,590
- Do you not know how to use it? - I'm telling you this first,

984
00:33:52,591 --> 00:33:54,890
we received permission from the fire station.

985
00:33:54,891 --> 00:33:57,489
- We have permission. - If you do take this,

986
00:33:57,490 --> 00:33:58,830
we will give you this for free.

987
00:33:58,831 --> 00:33:59,959
(If you take it, we will give you a fire extinguisher for free.)

988
00:33:59,960 --> 00:34:02,222
We will give it to you. It's for free.

989
00:34:02,530 --> 00:34:05,267
- Just in case. - Use it while you're cooking meat.

990
00:34:05,500 --> 00:34:07,669
Try it. It should work.

991
00:34:07,670 --> 00:34:09,560
(We will show it to you straightaway.)

992
00:34:10,911 --> 00:34:12,179
Is this how it works?

993
00:34:12,180 --> 00:34:13,610
- Wait. - Hold on.

994
00:34:13,611 --> 00:34:15,179
This works well.

995
00:34:15,180 --> 00:34:16,779
- Hold on. - Don't worry about it.

996
00:34:16,780 --> 00:34:18,639
I'm quite disappointed about the show.

997
00:34:18,820 --> 00:34:20,538
- Look. - You called to show me this?

998
00:34:20,981 --> 00:34:22,020
(Please work)

999
00:34:22,021 --> 00:34:23,989
- It's not even working. - You can't see because it's bright.

1000
00:34:23,990 --> 00:34:25,879
- It's working. - What is this?

1001
00:34:25,990 --> 00:34:28,253
What is this?

1002
00:34:28,360 --> 00:34:29,370
Wait, it's working.

1003
00:34:30,360 --> 00:34:32,259
It's working.

1004
00:34:32,260 --> 00:34:33,429
- It's working. - It is.

1005
00:34:33,430 --> 00:34:38,824
(A small fire ignited a flame successfully.)

1006
00:34:38,970 --> 00:34:40,183
- Do it again. - Try it again.

1007
00:34:40,300 --> 00:34:41,870
You have to keep pumping it.

1008
00:34:41,871 --> 00:34:43,870
- You have to pump it. - Do it.

1009
00:34:43,871 --> 00:34:44,910
(They're working hard together.)

1010
00:34:44,911 --> 00:34:47,980
You need three people for this.

1011
00:34:48,081 --> 00:34:49,222
Keep pumping.

1012
00:34:49,450 --> 00:34:51,009
The oil is dripping out.

1013
00:34:51,010 --> 00:34:52,263
It's too strong right now.

1014
00:34:53,521 --> 00:34:56,819
(After one fire show,)

1015
00:34:56,820 --> 00:34:57,920
(the flame weeder cools down.)

1016
00:34:57,921 --> 00:34:59,032
Is it broken?

1017
00:35:01,061 --> 00:35:03,460
(The oil drips out instead of a flame.)

1018
00:35:03,461 --> 00:35:05,016
The gas should come out.

1019
00:35:05,061 --> 00:35:07,221
Urine is coming out instead of gas.

1020
00:35:08,430 --> 00:35:11,096
(The flame weeder is urinating on the street.)

1021
00:35:12,041 --> 00:35:14,899
- I guess it was urgent. - What's happening with this?

1022
00:35:15,911 --> 00:35:18,163
- I guess it was urgent. - This isn't going to work.

1023
00:35:18,211 --> 00:35:20,080
- Just take out the next item. - I was worried about...

1024
00:35:20,081 --> 00:35:21,797
my item when I came along.

1025
00:35:22,251 --> 00:35:23,896
- But I can't do this trade. - Hold on.

1026
00:35:24,010 --> 00:35:26,049
- It's a bluetooth speaker. - That looks alright.

1027
00:35:26,050 --> 00:35:27,449
I like listening to music when I go camping.

1028
00:35:27,450 --> 00:35:30,350
- A member of SF9... - Really?

1029
00:35:30,351 --> 00:35:31,501
used it.

1030
00:35:31,621 --> 00:35:33,004
On top of that, we have perfume...

1031
00:35:33,121 --> 00:35:34,120
- The shaver. - Take the shaver.

1032
00:35:34,121 --> 00:35:35,343
He needs it.

1033
00:35:35,561 --> 00:35:37,177
It's difficult to shave when you go camping.

1034
00:35:37,231 --> 00:35:38,960
- That looks good. - It's a shaver.

1035
00:35:38,961 --> 00:35:41,429
- We will give them to you as a set. - By the way,

1036
00:35:41,430 --> 00:35:42,600
- I prepared this after the call. - We need to see it too.

1037
00:35:42,601 --> 00:35:44,600
- I know. - I brought these.

1038
00:35:44,601 --> 00:35:46,399
- What is it? - It'll be unbelievable.

1039
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:47,799
- What is this? - Well...

1040
00:35:47,800 --> 00:35:49,387
We haven't decided yet. We will after we have a look.

1041
00:35:49,740 --> 00:35:51,054
- Well... - Is this liquor?

1042
00:35:51,541 --> 00:35:53,179
They're all food.

1043
00:35:53,180 --> 00:35:54,665
(Se Yoon's item: Biscuits, nutritions, Chinese liquor)

1044
00:35:54,851 --> 00:35:56,109
It's around there.

1045
00:35:56,110 --> 00:35:57,750
I think we'll have to look into Se Yoon's bag.

1046
00:35:57,751 --> 00:36:00,709
(I think we'll have to look into Se Yoon's bag.)

1047
00:36:00,820 --> 00:36:02,319
- Sorry, but I heard everything. - Did you?

1048
00:36:02,320 --> 00:36:04,290
We just wanted to check what was in your bag.

1049
00:36:04,291 --> 00:36:05,319
This...

1050
00:36:05,320 --> 00:36:07,190
- Open it. - We have to blur out the bag.

1051
00:36:07,191 --> 00:36:09,989
- There's nothing to show in my bag. - Really?

1052
00:36:09,990 --> 00:36:11,799
There's something shiny in it.

1053
00:36:11,800 --> 00:36:12,973
- What is it? - What's that?

1054
00:36:13,561 --> 00:36:14,600
It's a golden ring.

1055
00:36:14,601 --> 00:36:16,699
(A hidden golden ring is discovered.)

1056
00:36:16,700 --> 00:36:18,040
(What is this?)

1057
00:36:18,041 --> 00:36:19,140
A golden ring.

1058
00:36:19,141 --> 00:36:21,121
- Was this on purpose? - No.

1059
00:36:21,411 --> 00:36:22,670
You took it off before coming here.

1060
00:36:22,671 --> 00:36:24,832
- This... - He has a reason behind this.

1061
00:36:24,880 --> 00:36:25,940
My mother...

1062
00:36:25,941 --> 00:36:27,410
told me that if...

1063
00:36:27,411 --> 00:36:29,774
I want more job offers from shows, I need to bring around gold.

1064
00:36:29,811 --> 00:36:32,275
I took off my wedding ring and wore it for two weeks.

1065
00:36:32,851 --> 00:36:35,890
- I lost two jobs after that. - Yes, that's right.

1066
00:36:35,891 --> 00:36:37,250
(A cursed golden ring that takes away jobs.)

1067
00:36:37,251 --> 00:36:38,735
- You took it off straightaway. - Yes, I did straightaway.

1068
00:36:39,061 --> 00:36:42,120
I was going to get rid of it or sell it. But I thought I should...

1069
00:36:42,331 --> 00:36:44,279
just carry it around, so I put it in my bag.

1070
00:36:44,530 --> 00:36:46,550
But since you have bad memories from it...

1071
00:36:47,630 --> 00:36:49,569
- You should... - You need to get rid of them.

1072
00:36:49,570 --> 00:36:51,116
Bad memories aren't good for the new year.

1073
00:36:51,570 --> 00:36:54,069
Since it's not a good memory, and my mother is okay with it.

1074
00:36:54,070 --> 00:36:55,640
- Are you sure it's okay? - It's okay.

1075
00:36:55,641 --> 00:36:58,210
Yes, I didn't even use it. It was mostly in the bag.

1076
00:36:58,211 --> 00:36:59,310
- Yes. - I see, okay.

1077
00:36:59,311 --> 00:37:00,980
Se Yoon, thank you.

1078
00:37:00,981 --> 00:37:02,829
- Thank you. - Thank you.

1079
00:37:03,081 --> 00:37:04,310
- Good luck. - Good luck.

1080
00:37:04,311 --> 00:37:05,319
- Thank you. - Thanks.

1081
00:37:05,320 --> 00:37:07,049
- Thank you. - Thank you.

1082
00:37:07,050 --> 00:37:09,950
(A golden ring and snacks are swapped with SF9's items.)

1083
00:37:10,590 --> 00:37:11,631
Is it here?

1084
00:37:12,220 --> 00:37:13,790
We're at Jong Kook's kid's cafe.

1085
00:37:13,791 --> 00:37:15,060
- Hey. - Looks who's here.

1086
00:37:15,061 --> 00:37:16,359
- Hello. - Hello.

1087
00:37:16,360 --> 00:37:18,730
- Hello, excuse us. - It's quite big.

1088
00:37:18,731 --> 00:37:19,799
(Which customer is waiting at Jong Kook's stage?)

1089
00:37:19,800 --> 00:37:20,841
Where is he?

1090
00:37:21,700 --> 00:37:23,129
Hello.

1091
00:37:23,130 --> 00:37:24,129
Are you faking it?

1092
00:37:24,130 --> 00:37:26,540
Why are you pretending to work hard?

1093
00:37:26,541 --> 00:37:28,170
Why are you standing like that?

1094
00:37:28,171 --> 00:37:29,221
(Actor Oh Chang Seok, Jong Kook's gym buddy.)

1095
00:37:29,570 --> 00:37:31,679
(A handsome and tall guy)

1096
00:37:31,680 --> 00:37:33,609
(A handsome actor with great acting skills.)

1097
00:37:33,610 --> 00:37:36,279
(He was also So Min's partner...)

1098
00:37:36,280 --> 00:37:38,949
(in the drama, "Princess Aurora".)

1099
00:37:38,950 --> 00:37:40,420
- Sorry for this Chang Seok. - No problem.

1100
00:37:40,421 --> 00:37:41,819
Sorry for disturbing when you're working out.

1101
00:37:41,820 --> 00:37:44,290
- I know how it feels... - Hello.

1102
00:37:44,291 --> 00:37:46,390
to be disturbed while you're at the gym.

1103
00:37:46,391 --> 00:37:48,652
- Not a problem. - You look like you were waiting.

1104
00:37:49,260 --> 00:37:51,654
- You look dressed up for this. - No, not at all.

1105
00:37:52,130 --> 00:37:54,199
(It's what I usually wear.)

1106
00:37:54,200 --> 00:37:55,830
- Really? While you listen to music? - I usually dress like this...

1107
00:37:55,831 --> 00:37:57,299
and always listen to music.

1108
00:37:57,300 --> 00:37:58,899
(Chang Seok is fashionable at the gym, and music is a must.)

1109
00:37:58,900 --> 00:38:00,052
Are you always dressed well?

1110
00:38:00,101 --> 00:38:01,687
- Yes, I do. - Hold on.

1111
00:38:02,141 --> 00:38:04,710
Chang Seok should be on our show properly.

1112
00:38:04,711 --> 00:38:06,009
- I know. - Exactly.

1113
00:38:06,010 --> 00:38:08,334
- I heard the rumors. - Why didn't you?

1114
00:38:08,380 --> 00:38:10,098
Well, I never got asked,

1115
00:38:10,251 --> 00:38:11,520
but I think featuring like this is enough.

1116
00:38:11,521 --> 00:38:13,520
- No, you have to come one day. - No, it's okay.

1117
00:38:13,521 --> 00:38:15,149
- You should... - I heard his sense of humor...

1118
00:38:15,150 --> 00:38:16,250
- He... - Not at all.

1119
00:38:16,251 --> 00:38:18,219
- He's not like how he looks. - He looks normal but...

1120
00:38:18,220 --> 00:38:19,589
he's actually very unique.

1121
00:38:19,590 --> 00:38:20,660
I'm cost-effective.

1122
00:38:20,661 --> 00:38:22,448
(I'm cost-effective.)

1123
00:38:22,461 --> 00:38:24,160
That was a great line.

1124
00:38:24,161 --> 00:38:25,259
- Chang Seok. - Yes.

1125
00:38:25,260 --> 00:38:26,660
If you have any good items...

1126
00:38:26,661 --> 00:38:27,799
- Like what I mentioned earlier... - But...

1127
00:38:27,800 --> 00:38:29,600
I got the call this morning.

1128
00:38:29,601 --> 00:38:32,870
I heard that others were bringing audio equipment.

1129
00:38:32,871 --> 00:38:35,568
I looked around the house the whole morning.

1130
00:38:35,871 --> 00:38:36,921
For me,

1131
00:38:36,941 --> 00:38:40,379
I used to like collecting shoes.

1132
00:38:40,380 --> 00:38:41,649
Yes, that's a well-known fact.

1133
00:38:41,650 --> 00:38:44,277
I don't buy them nowadays. But I still have them.

1134
00:38:44,351 --> 00:38:46,149
So I brought a few pairs.

1135
00:38:46,150 --> 00:38:47,736
- That's great. - Perfect.

1136
00:38:48,050 --> 00:38:50,171
- Is it okay if they're worn? - It's okay.

1137
00:38:50,191 --> 00:38:52,181
It's okay. Can we have a look?

1138
00:38:52,220 --> 00:38:53,574
Yes, sure.

1139
00:38:53,791 --> 00:38:55,750
- There they are. - There they are.

1140
00:38:55,930 --> 00:38:58,688
This isn't an expensive pair.

1141
00:38:58,900 --> 00:39:00,345
- It's just running shoes. - Running shoes.

1142
00:39:00,360 --> 00:39:02,723
But once you wear them,

1143
00:39:03,171 --> 00:39:05,399
This is a great item to those who collect shoes.

1144
00:39:05,400 --> 00:39:06,699
- Really? - Yes.

1145
00:39:06,700 --> 00:39:08,054
- Is it worth it? - Yes, it is.

1146
00:39:08,510 --> 00:39:10,631
This is a worthy item.

1147
00:39:11,581 --> 00:39:13,879
This is an approved item to those...

1148
00:39:13,880 --> 00:39:16,031
- who like collecting shoes. - Really?

1149
00:39:16,751 --> 00:39:17,891
We got something big from him.

1150
00:39:17,950 --> 00:39:20,250
- Yes, and our item... - Yes, our item.

1151
00:39:20,251 --> 00:39:21,819
You have to explain it properly.

1152
00:39:21,820 --> 00:39:24,759
- You like collections, right? - What kind of collections?

1153
00:39:24,760 --> 00:39:26,489
- You like collaborations too. - A collaboration...

1154
00:39:26,490 --> 00:39:27,632
To put it in simple words,

1155
00:39:27,820 --> 00:39:30,929
you like collecting items that are worthy.

1156
00:39:30,930 --> 00:39:32,244
Look at it this way.

1157
00:39:32,760 --> 00:39:35,799
- It's like how Bob Marley... - Bob Marley.

1158
00:39:35,800 --> 00:39:37,699
gave something to Michael Jackson.

1159
00:39:37,700 --> 00:39:40,297
- His signature is on it too. - Bob Marley signed it.

1160
00:39:41,570 --> 00:39:43,509
You can look at it that way.

1161
00:39:43,510 --> 00:39:45,126
- It's a limited edition. - Is it?

1162
00:39:45,180 --> 00:39:46,595
- It is limited. - Okay.

1163
00:39:46,840 --> 00:39:49,173
- I can't even purchase it. - None of us can.

1164
00:39:49,351 --> 00:39:51,949
You can't purchase it. There's only one of it in this world.

1165
00:39:51,950 --> 00:39:53,092
The only one...

1166
00:39:53,880 --> 00:39:55,567
But this is...

1167
00:39:55,621 --> 00:39:56,719
This...

1168
00:39:56,720 --> 00:39:59,290
(To Michael Jong Kook from Ha Marley)

1169
00:39:59,291 --> 00:40:02,260
This is Haha's RGP album.

1170
00:40:02,430 --> 00:40:04,310
- Haha gave this to me... - Is it a CD?

1171
00:40:04,930 --> 00:40:07,829
"Jong Kook, my only partner."

1172
00:40:07,961 --> 00:40:10,091
"I love you". He signed it for me.

1173
00:40:11,231 --> 00:40:13,839
It's like how Bob Marley signed an album for Michael Jackson.

1174
00:40:13,840 --> 00:40:16,032
That's how much it's worth.

1175
00:40:16,641 --> 00:40:18,339
(He's done with the promotion.)

1176
00:40:18,340 --> 00:40:20,360
There's no way I can listen...

1177
00:40:20,510 --> 00:40:21,592
to a CD as of now.

1178
00:40:21,711 --> 00:40:23,779
- But thank you very much. - You can listen to it in the car.

1179
00:40:23,780 --> 00:40:25,520
- You can't open it though. - That's right.

1180
00:40:25,521 --> 00:40:27,179
You have to keep it like this.

1181
00:40:27,180 --> 00:40:28,750
- Yes. - Just in case,

1182
00:40:28,751 --> 00:40:30,290
if something happens to one of us,

1183
00:40:30,291 --> 00:40:32,190
- It's going to be worthy. - It'll become worthy.

1184
00:40:32,191 --> 00:40:33,807
- You never know. - I guess.

1185
00:40:34,720 --> 00:40:36,529
- You never know. - I guess.

1186
00:40:36,530 --> 00:40:37,529
Yes.

1187
00:40:37,530 --> 00:40:39,622
(Feeling bitter)

1188
00:40:40,030 --> 00:40:42,199
Your expression tells us everything.

1189
00:40:42,200 --> 00:40:43,770
- I can't hide my feelings. - He's disappointed.

1190
00:40:43,771 --> 00:40:45,270
- He's an honest guy. - He can't hide anything.

1191
00:40:45,271 --> 00:40:46,299
I can't hide it.

1192
00:40:46,300 --> 00:40:48,492
- You have to show it. - Shorry took the hat.

1193
00:40:48,610 --> 00:40:51,095
He was actually going to take this, but...

1194
00:40:51,211 --> 00:40:52,440
- Did he change it? - I was handing it to him but...

1195
00:40:52,441 --> 00:40:53,854
he suddenly changed his mind.

1196
00:40:55,010 --> 00:40:57,233
The collaboration between Bob Marley and Michael Jackson.

1197
00:40:57,380 --> 00:40:58,733
The collaboration or...

1198
00:40:59,450 --> 00:41:00,834
the handmade hat.

1199
00:41:01,751 --> 00:41:03,034
Choose one.

1200
00:41:03,550 --> 00:41:04,960
(He didn't even look at the CD and chose the hat.)

1201
00:41:04,961 --> 00:41:06,304
He likes fashion.

1202
00:41:06,421 --> 00:41:08,037
Really...

1203
00:41:08,090 --> 00:41:10,330
I think I'll really love this hat.

1204
00:41:10,331 --> 00:41:11,815
(He feels bitter too.)

1205
00:41:13,661 --> 00:41:15,199
He suddenly wanted the hat.

1206
00:41:15,200 --> 00:41:17,129
I think anyone would've taken the hat instead.

1207
00:41:17,130 --> 00:41:18,339
(He says it firmly.)

1208
00:41:18,340 --> 00:41:20,967
(An honest confession)

1209
00:41:22,110 --> 00:41:24,261
You can at least use the hat.

1210
00:41:24,711 --> 00:41:25,994
That was a big blow.

1211
00:41:26,180 --> 00:41:28,777
- I don't have a CD player. - That's right.

1212
00:41:29,411 --> 00:41:30,810
I guess CDs are old-fashioned now.

1213
00:41:30,811 --> 00:41:33,549
- This is just a collected item. - Look at him.

1214
00:41:33,550 --> 00:41:35,219
He looks normal, but he's actually...

1215
00:41:35,220 --> 00:41:37,449
Inside this, there's a RGP badge.

1216
00:41:37,450 --> 00:41:40,460
- That's right. There's also a tape, - Yes, that's right.

1217
00:41:40,461 --> 00:41:42,884
It's also meaningful since it's a gift from me.

1218
00:41:42,961 --> 00:41:45,152
It's been passed on between us.

1219
00:41:45,331 --> 00:41:47,119
I really respect him as a friend.

1220
00:41:47,161 --> 00:41:48,529
I really like him.

1221
00:41:48,530 --> 00:41:50,230
Then you should do something together.

1222
00:41:50,231 --> 00:41:52,040
- Also... - Moreover,

1223
00:41:52,041 --> 00:41:54,040
- you'll receive... - That's right.

1224
00:41:54,041 --> 00:41:56,310
10 free lessons from coach Kim Jong Kook.

1225
00:41:56,311 --> 00:41:58,009
(10 free lessons from Coach Kim Jong Kook)

1226
00:41:58,010 --> 00:41:59,279
(Hold on)

1227
00:41:59,280 --> 00:42:01,850
I have something to say about this.

1228
00:42:01,851 --> 00:42:04,235
Jong Kook... To be honest...

1229
00:42:04,311 --> 00:42:05,330
People can...

1230
00:42:05,880 --> 00:42:07,049
People might think that I avoid you...

1231
00:42:07,050 --> 00:42:09,219
- because I dislike you. - I guess.

1232
00:42:09,220 --> 00:42:10,649
So please make no misunderstanding.

1233
00:42:10,650 --> 00:42:13,691
But that's not it. I really like him personally.

1234
00:42:13,961 --> 00:42:16,029
But at the gym...

1235
00:42:16,030 --> 00:42:17,243
- You haven't experienced it, right? - I haven't.

1236
00:42:17,490 --> 00:42:18,874
It's exhausting.

1237
00:42:19,300 --> 00:42:20,916
You don't know the limit.

1238
00:42:22,200 --> 00:42:24,399
(Jong Kook doesn't know when to stop.)

1239
00:42:24,400 --> 00:42:26,670
Son Heung Min limped off the field.

1240
00:42:26,671 --> 00:42:27,710
You're right.

1241
00:42:27,800 --> 00:42:30,170
If I had his body,

1242
00:42:30,171 --> 00:42:32,009
- I can't go to work. - Right.

1243
00:42:32,010 --> 00:42:33,425
I am not planning to be like him!

1244
00:42:33,481 --> 00:42:36,649
But it seems like he wants to make everyone like him.

1245
00:42:36,650 --> 00:42:39,954
(Jong Kook wants to turn everyone like him.)

1246
00:42:40,220 --> 00:42:41,589
That's what he wants.

1247
00:42:41,590 --> 00:42:43,790
I'm not exaggerating,

1248
00:42:43,791 --> 00:42:45,710
Jong Kook exercises like this.

1249
00:42:46,191 --> 00:42:48,686
He turns the volume to max, mostly hip-hop.

1250
00:42:48,961 --> 00:42:51,529
This is how he does it.

1251
00:42:51,530 --> 00:42:54,629
- Can I show them? - Yes, you can.

1252
00:42:54,630 --> 00:42:56,317
Do you think you can?

1253
00:42:56,501 --> 00:42:57,799
Show us, use the equipment.

1254
00:42:57,800 --> 00:42:59,770
Let's say he was using this.

1255
00:42:59,771 --> 00:43:01,892
And he'll be like...

1256
00:43:02,311 --> 00:43:03,511
I'm for real.

1257
00:43:03,512 --> 00:43:04,689
(Getting into position)

(Exclaiming weirdly)

1263
00:43:21,950 --> 00:43:23,566
Oh, that is tasty!

(3 sentences summary of Jong Kook's workout)

1265

(Weird shoutings and, "Oh, that is tasty!")

1266
00:43:30,861 --> 00:43:33,560
(The gym to Jong Kook is a five-star restaurant.)

1267
00:43:33,561 --> 00:43:34,914
Oh, that is tasty!

1268
00:43:35,760 --> 00:43:38,023
- He says that? - That is too tasty!

1269
00:43:38,200 --> 00:43:39,311
I mean,

1270
00:43:39,700 --> 00:43:40,969
Jong Kook.

1271
00:43:40,970 --> 00:43:42,384
You're not in a restaurant.

1272
00:43:42,970 --> 00:43:45,839
- Why are you saying it's tasty? - It is tasty, isn't it?

1273
00:43:46,010 --> 00:43:48,210
- That is tasty! - Wow, that's crazy.

1274
00:43:48,211 --> 00:43:50,059
So he's feeding his biceps,

1275
00:43:50,211 --> 00:43:51,726
and he thinks it's tasty.

1276
00:43:52,550 --> 00:43:54,179
Jong Kook!

1277
00:43:54,180 --> 00:43:55,820
- It's cool, isn't it? - It's very cool.

1278
00:43:55,821 --> 00:43:58,020
- It's very unique. - I'm in style.

1279
00:43:58,021 --> 00:43:59,031
Well, thank you.

1280
00:43:59,321 --> 00:44:01,920
(Chang Seok switched his collection of rare shoes...)

1281
00:44:01,921 --> 00:44:04,113
(with Jong Kook and Haha's CD.)

1282
00:44:05,160 --> 00:44:09,039
(All teams have exchanged their items.)

1283
00:44:09,100 --> 00:44:10,919
You're already here!

1284
00:44:10,930 --> 00:44:12,082
Hello.

1285
00:44:12,631 --> 00:44:15,099
Hi, I'm the host of today's unboxing auction,

1286
00:44:15,100 --> 00:44:16,699
Jo Jeong Sik, a newscaster of SBS.

1287
00:44:16,700 --> 00:44:18,085
(All the goods will be appraised with our special guest, Jeong Sik.)

1288
00:44:18,711 --> 00:44:20,070
He's good-looking.

1289
00:44:20,071 --> 00:44:21,710
First, I will introduce you to our evaluators...

1290
00:44:21,711 --> 00:44:24,033
who will help with the assessment.

1291
00:44:24,881 --> 00:44:26,294
Really?

1292
00:44:26,680 --> 00:44:28,337
He is a fair friend of mine.

1293
00:44:29,381 --> 00:44:32,920
We will begin with today's evaluation.

1294
00:44:32,921 --> 00:44:34,769
Which team would like to start?

1295
00:44:34,850 --> 00:44:36,460
- We'll be evaluated first. - Let's do that one first.

1296
00:44:36,461 --> 00:44:39,860
We have here that was eaten by Qin Shi Huang.

1297
00:44:39,861 --> 00:44:41,029
Qin Shi Huang?

1298
00:44:41,030 --> 00:44:43,021
(Team Seok Jin has the flame weeder, various supplements, and gold ring.)

1299
00:44:43,131 --> 00:44:45,151
We'd like to have this one evaluated first.

1300
00:44:45,401 --> 00:44:47,099
Many people have coveted this, but we didn't sell it.

1301
00:44:47,100 --> 00:44:49,940
- People did covet this. - Many people did.

1302
00:44:49,941 --> 00:44:51,639
It's a flame weeder.

1303
00:44:51,640 --> 00:44:55,316
It breathes flames and burns those little weeds.

1304
00:44:55,341 --> 00:44:58,909
We could've exchanged it with a costly bracelet,

1305
00:44:58,910 --> 00:45:01,449
- but we decided not to. - She's right.

1306
00:45:01,450 --> 00:45:02,750
This one will be evaluated by Park Ki Young.

1307
00:45:02,751 --> 00:45:03,949
This looks like scrap metal.

1308
00:45:03,950 --> 00:45:06,250
(This looks like scrap metal.)

1309
00:45:06,251 --> 00:45:07,820
(He takes the magnet to it.)

1310
00:45:07,821 --> 00:45:10,619
(The magnet stuck to it!)

1311
00:45:10,620 --> 00:45:11,641
Mr. Park.

1312
00:45:12,691 --> 00:45:14,960
Wait, he's using the magnet.

1313
00:45:14,961 --> 00:45:16,529
(It's magnetic scrap metal, will it affect the estimated value?)

1314
00:45:16,530 --> 00:45:17,759
He's using the magnet.

1315
00:45:17,760 --> 00:45:19,070
(It's magnetic scrap metal, will it affect the estimated value?)

1316
00:45:19,071 --> 00:45:20,716
- Did you figure out its material? - Yes, I did.

1317
00:45:20,870 --> 00:45:22,486
Let's weigh this.

1318
00:45:22,700 --> 00:45:23,770
- It should be weighing a lot. - It's heavy.

1319
00:45:23,771 --> 00:45:25,840
- It must be heavy. - Wow.

1320
00:45:25,841 --> 00:45:27,210
- It's almost 3kg. - 3kg?

1321
00:45:27,211 --> 00:45:28,779
(This flame weeder weighs almost 3kg!)

1322
00:45:28,780 --> 00:45:30,559
It's 3kg. Goodness.

1323
00:45:31,341 --> 00:45:32,794
- Are you finished? - Yes, that's it.

1324
00:45:33,410 --> 00:45:34,549
- Wait, that's it? - Yes.

1325
00:45:34,550 --> 00:45:36,020
(Evaluation was finished in a minute.)

1326
00:45:36,021 --> 00:45:37,192
That's it?

1327
00:45:37,481 --> 00:45:38,561
How is it over?

1328
00:45:39,091 --> 00:45:40,719
- Do some more! - It's over already?

1329
00:45:40,720 --> 00:45:42,290
- It's... - Please look at it again!

1330
00:45:42,291 --> 00:45:43,619
- That was it? - You're done?

1331
00:45:43,620 --> 00:45:46,190
Okay. 1, 2, 3, show us the price!

1332
00:45:46,191 --> 00:45:49,291
(All he did was stick a magnet and put it on a scale.)

1333
00:45:49,530 --> 00:45:51,599
(What will the price of the flame weeder be?)

1334
00:45:51,600 --> 00:45:52,969
- 1 dollar? - 1 dollar!

1335
00:45:52,970 --> 00:45:55,365
(It is priced 1 dollar.)

1336
00:45:56,370 --> 00:45:57,869
- One dollar? - That's just mean.

1337
00:45:57,870 --> 00:45:59,440
This kind of hurts.

1338
00:45:59,441 --> 00:46:00,840
Just one dollar?

1339
00:46:00,841 --> 00:46:02,139
You only estimated it as scrap metal?

1340
00:46:02,140 --> 00:46:03,679
Yes, unfortunately.

1341
00:46:03,680 --> 00:46:07,387
If you sold this on a secondhand site, you could get more.

1342
00:46:07,410 --> 00:46:09,349
- But for us, - Excuse me, sir.

1343
00:46:09,350 --> 00:46:11,920
Are all non-magnetic stuff of no use to you?

1344
00:46:11,921 --> 00:46:13,335
- Yes, this is only scrap metal. - It's just metal.

1345
00:46:13,620 --> 00:46:15,090
(If it's magnetic, it is useless to a recycling expert.)

1346
00:46:15,091 --> 00:46:16,908
How much if it wasn't magnetic?

1347
00:46:16,961 --> 00:46:18,529
If it wasn't,

1348
00:46:18,530 --> 00:46:21,419
I'd say about three dollars.

1349
00:46:21,861 --> 00:46:23,259
(So non-magnetic is better?)

1350
00:46:23,260 --> 00:46:24,500
- Non-magnetic is better? - Yes, it is.

1351
00:46:24,501 --> 00:46:25,699
Why is that?

1352
00:46:25,700 --> 00:46:27,519
Because then it means it's stainless.

1353
00:46:27,731 --> 00:46:30,369
If it's magnetic, it's junk.

1354
00:46:30,370 --> 00:46:31,599
- I see. - Yes.

1355
00:46:31,600 --> 00:46:33,732
So non-magnetic was better!

1356
00:46:34,771 --> 00:46:36,629
Okay, one dollar.

1357
00:46:37,211 --> 00:46:40,049
I think you will be surprised by this one.

1358
00:46:40,050 --> 00:46:41,279
(It's the gold ring from Se Yoon.)

1359
00:46:41,280 --> 00:46:42,719
- A ring? - Is that gold?

1360
00:46:42,720 --> 00:46:44,134
(It's the gold ring from Se Yoon.)

1361
00:46:44,921 --> 00:46:46,119
- A gold ring. - Is that gold?

1362
00:46:46,120 --> 00:46:47,719
- A gold ring. - This is real gold.

1363
00:46:47,720 --> 00:46:49,389
- It's 24 karat. - A 24 karat gold ring.

1364
00:46:49,390 --> 00:46:51,178
- Who gave you this? - What did you swap this with?

1365
00:46:51,220 --> 00:46:53,211
- It was... - Try this on.

1366
00:46:53,490 --> 00:46:54,642
Seok Jin, are you sure?

1367
00:46:54,830 --> 00:46:57,259
(It fits right into Jae Seok's finger.)

1368
00:46:57,260 --> 00:46:58,310
No, this is bad.

1369
00:46:58,631 --> 00:47:01,559
Se Yoon lost 2 shows after wearing this.

1370
00:47:01,870 --> 00:47:02,869
Oh, really?

1371
00:47:02,870 --> 00:47:04,890
(Se Yoon lost 2 shows after wearing this.)

1372
00:47:05,341 --> 00:47:06,540
So his plan was to put this ring...

1373
00:47:06,541 --> 00:47:09,439
on your finger so you can focus on Running Man only.

1374
00:47:09,441 --> 00:47:11,430
He wanted to make Running Man your one and only show.

1375
00:47:11,541 --> 00:47:14,711
We have a 24 karat gold ring on the table.

1376
00:47:15,010 --> 00:47:16,949
He pulled out a magnifying glass!

1377
00:47:16,950 --> 00:47:18,364
This is serious, he's serious.

1378
00:47:19,890 --> 00:47:21,103
He's got a flashlight, too!

1379
00:47:21,151 --> 00:47:22,575
It was about time.

1380
00:47:22,821 --> 00:47:24,420
What if it's fake?

1381
00:47:24,421 --> 00:47:26,029
It looks a bit crooked...

1382
00:47:26,030 --> 00:47:28,112
- I think it's real. - Yes, I think so, too.

1383
00:47:28,231 --> 00:47:29,775
What matters now is the weight.

1384
00:47:29,901 --> 00:47:31,376
It depends on its weight.

1385
00:47:32,330 --> 00:47:34,593
This one has taken the longest yet.

1386
00:47:34,671 --> 00:47:35,954
Should we use the magnet?

1387
00:47:36,970 --> 00:47:38,199
(The metal evaluator steps forward.)

1388
00:47:38,200 --> 00:47:39,250
The magnet?

1389
00:47:40,211 --> 00:47:41,570
- The magnet. - The magnet?

1390
00:47:41,571 --> 00:47:42,739
(It's supposed to be real gold.)

1391
00:47:42,740 --> 00:47:43,790
Does it stick?

1392
00:47:44,611 --> 00:47:46,095
- Does it stick? - No, it doesn't.

1393
00:47:47,010 --> 00:47:48,798
It could be just copper.

1394
00:47:49,220 --> 00:47:50,579
- You mean plated? - I hope that's the case.

1395
00:47:50,580 --> 00:47:52,590
- Just copper plated with gold. - Please reveal your price.

1396
00:47:52,591 --> 00:47:54,849
(It's definitely not junk. The price for the gold ring is...)

1397
00:47:54,850 --> 00:47:57,989
(420 dollars)

1398
00:47:57,990 --> 00:47:59,748
- 420 dollars! - 420 dollars?

1399
00:48:00,890 --> 00:48:01,900
(Se Yoon, you're the best!)

1400
00:48:01,901 --> 00:48:03,546
- 420 dollars! - 420 dollars?

1401
00:48:04,401 --> 00:48:07,770
(The high price of the gold ring rattles the nerves of other teams.)

1402
00:48:07,771 --> 00:48:08,781
That's expensive.

1403
00:48:08,970 --> 00:48:10,400
They have a total of 600 dollars.

1404
00:48:10,401 --> 00:48:13,905
(Team Seok Jin's total: 606 dollars.)

1405
00:48:14,111 --> 00:48:16,880
Let's move on to our second team's items.

1406
00:48:16,881 --> 00:48:18,901
These are our first items.

1407
00:48:19,080 --> 00:48:20,828
We will go with fashion items.

1408
00:48:21,211 --> 00:48:24,311
Young Jin, try to be more difficult.

1409
00:48:24,950 --> 00:48:27,374
Expert Oh Young Jin is up for the first time.

1410
00:48:27,651 --> 00:48:30,489
This one has Shorry's pride on the line.

1411
00:48:30,921 --> 00:48:33,415
You can't get these anywhere else, even if you wanted to.

1412
00:48:35,231 --> 00:48:36,775
(Rummaging through the clothes)

1413
00:48:37,160 --> 00:48:40,130
You can find these at vintage shops around Hongdae.

1414
00:48:40,131 --> 00:48:42,139
(You can find these at vintage shops around Hongdae.)

1415
00:48:42,140 --> 00:48:44,120
But not this particular brand.

1416
00:48:45,140 --> 00:48:46,787
- This brand... - You can't find it.

1417
00:48:46,941 --> 00:48:47,940
(Sighing)

1418
00:48:47,941 --> 00:48:49,279
He's tilting his head!

1419
00:48:49,280 --> 00:48:52,209
(He's trying to make up his mind.)

1420
00:48:52,950 --> 00:48:54,779
- He's tilting his head! - Just be straightforward.

1421
00:48:54,780 --> 00:48:55,790
Young Jin!

1422
00:48:56,050 --> 00:48:58,650
- You are on television. - I guess they are not worthy.

1423
00:48:58,651 --> 00:49:00,206
You're the expert, so just go ahead.

1424
00:49:01,620 --> 00:49:04,550
You can find this particular brand at vintage shops.

1425
00:49:04,691 --> 00:49:05,860
Where!

1426
00:49:05,861 --> 00:49:07,560
(He gets personal.)

1427
00:49:07,561 --> 00:49:09,159
- Haha. - Take it easy.

1428
00:49:09,160 --> 00:49:10,929
- We want fair evaluations! - Why would you say that?

1429
00:49:10,930 --> 00:49:11,929
No, I was just...

1430
00:49:11,930 --> 00:49:14,969
He can't make a fair decision if you act so childish.

1431
00:49:14,970 --> 00:49:16,860
- There are many places. - No, what I meant was...

1432
00:49:17,341 --> 00:49:19,491
why couldn't you find one for me the last time I asked?

1433
00:49:21,140 --> 00:49:23,060
- There's this exact brand at shops? - Not the bigger sizes, though.

1434
00:49:23,381 --> 00:49:26,239
You won't be able to find bigger sizes of these.

1435
00:49:26,510 --> 00:49:29,752
They usually have women's sizes.

1436
00:49:30,120 --> 00:49:31,719
Oh, this one's for women.

1437
00:49:31,720 --> 00:49:35,731
(It was for women.)

1438
00:49:35,861 --> 00:49:38,688
Okay! He's an expert for sure.

1439
00:49:38,861 --> 00:49:39,900
He's very honest.

1440
00:49:40,631 --> 00:49:42,000
He's just trying to make me feel bad.

1441
00:49:42,001 --> 00:49:43,159
(He feels hurt somehow.)

1442
00:49:43,160 --> 00:49:45,329
Please come up with the total price.

1443
00:49:45,330 --> 00:49:46,986
- Yes, of course. - The total of all those.

1444
00:49:47,131 --> 00:49:48,858
They have a ton of those at Dongmyo.

1445
00:49:49,600 --> 00:49:51,256
- Namdaemun and... - You'll find a ton of those...

1446
00:49:51,370 --> 00:49:53,633
- if you go to Dongmyo. - For like 2, 3 dollars.

1447
00:49:54,311 --> 00:49:56,139
I've seen a hundred people wearing those at Dongmyo market.

1448
00:49:56,140 --> 00:49:58,131
Dongmyo is a very hip place.

1449
00:49:58,180 --> 00:49:59,695
The evaluation is done.

1450
00:49:59,910 --> 00:50:00,949
It is?

1451
00:50:00,950 --> 00:50:02,079
(The total price of clothes from Shorry is...)

1452
00:50:02,080 --> 00:50:03,880
(155 dollars.)

1453
00:50:03,881 --> 00:50:06,174
155 dollars.

1454
00:50:07,521 --> 00:50:09,560
(Well, that's not too bad.)

1455
00:50:09,561 --> 00:50:10,874
That's actually a fine price.

1456
00:50:11,091 --> 00:50:12,475
How are those so expensive?

1457
00:50:13,530 --> 00:50:15,107
- Okay, alright. - Okay.

1458
00:50:15,330 --> 00:50:17,060
That's actually a generous price.

1459
00:50:17,061 --> 00:50:18,414
- It really is. - That's a bit too much.

1460
00:50:19,631 --> 00:50:21,015
Okay, we've got more.

1461
00:50:21,231 --> 00:50:23,524
We have an ace in the hole. Sang Yeob gave us...

1462
00:50:23,571 --> 00:50:25,099
his family heirloom.

1463
00:50:25,100 --> 00:50:27,540
(That is no ordinary item.)

1464
00:50:27,541 --> 00:50:29,965
- What is that? - It looks expensive.

1465
00:50:30,510 --> 00:50:33,682
Expert Jung Se Woon could be drooling over this one.

1466
00:50:34,010 --> 00:50:35,480
That looks genuine.

1467
00:50:35,481 --> 00:50:36,650
(It has a unique aura not like the previous items.)

1468
00:50:36,651 --> 00:50:37,679
This could be very expensive.

1469
00:50:37,680 --> 00:50:39,420
Look at the details on the legs.

1470
00:50:39,421 --> 00:50:41,542
(The detailed touch almost brings them to life.)

1471
00:50:42,191 --> 00:50:43,420
(He carefully begins to appraise.)

1472
00:50:43,421 --> 00:50:45,349
You can tell how old it is.

1473
00:50:46,291 --> 00:50:47,340
Is it magnetic?

1474
00:50:48,861 --> 00:50:49,871
Of course, it's not...

1475
00:50:50,001 --> 00:50:53,329
(It stuck. It is scrap metal!)

1476
00:50:53,330 --> 00:50:54,684
- It stuck! - It's magnetic?

1477
00:50:55,341 --> 00:50:57,563
It's magnetic! That must be cheap.

1478
00:50:57,870 --> 00:50:58,952
It's cheap when it's magnetic.

1479
00:50:59,771 --> 00:51:01,239
That can't be right.

1480
00:51:01,240 --> 00:51:02,380
(She's disappointed.)

1481
00:51:02,381 --> 00:51:03,840
Is the bottom one magnetic, too?

1482
00:51:03,841 --> 00:51:05,770
- No, it's not. - Thank goodness.

1483
00:51:06,350 --> 00:51:07,409
Please look at it carefully.

1484
00:51:07,410 --> 00:51:09,168
It's been used quite often.

1485
00:51:10,651 --> 00:51:13,719
This is made of iron,

1486
00:51:13,720 --> 00:51:15,438
but this is made of bronze.

1487
00:51:15,591 --> 00:51:16,630
Is it bronze?

1488
00:51:17,291 --> 00:51:19,190
- It's bronze. - It's really bronze.

1489
00:51:19,191 --> 00:51:20,675
Isn't it gold, silver, and bronze?

1490
00:51:21,291 --> 00:51:22,775
Is it really bronze?

1491
00:51:22,800 --> 00:51:24,429
How much is bronze?

1492
00:51:24,430 --> 00:51:26,894
(Opposite reactions make them excited about the appraised value.)

1493
00:51:27,100 --> 00:51:28,770
- What do you think? - They're discussing.

1494
00:51:28,771 --> 00:51:31,224
(They suddenly get serious about it.)

1495
00:51:32,211 --> 00:51:34,210
(They have high hopes.)

1496
00:51:34,211 --> 00:51:37,779
Please turn it around when I say so. Show us the price.

1497
00:51:37,780 --> 00:51:39,568
(The appraisal is done after a long time.)

1498
00:51:40,151 --> 00:51:42,079
(This is amazing.)

1499
00:51:42,080 --> 00:51:43,719
(He brought his family heirloom.)

1500
00:51:43,720 --> 00:51:45,020
If my parents find out, they'll kick me out.

1501
00:51:45,021 --> 00:51:48,520
(Sang Yeob brought it without telling his parents about it.)

1502
00:51:48,521 --> 00:51:52,130
(Looking rare and precious, it's hard to know how old it is.)

1503
00:51:52,131 --> 00:51:55,362
Sang Yeob's father is expecting a lot.

1504
00:51:56,260 --> 00:52:00,472
(How much is the price that everyone is hopeful about?)

1505
00:52:00,571 --> 00:52:01,581
It's 150 dollars.

1506
00:52:01,700 --> 00:52:03,993
(150 dollars?)

1507
00:52:04,300 --> 00:52:05,786
It's 150 dollars.

1508
00:52:06,870 --> 00:52:08,658
- We can still win. - It's worth about 150 dollars.

1509
00:52:08,711 --> 00:52:10,040
- We could win. - We'll win.

1510
00:52:10,041 --> 00:52:11,840
Could you explain?

1511
00:52:11,841 --> 00:52:14,809
There are many like this in Korea.

1512
00:52:15,280 --> 00:52:18,320
There are many, but this is clean.

1513
00:52:18,321 --> 00:52:19,449
(It's not rare, but it's well-kept.)

1514
00:52:19,450 --> 00:52:21,369
- Is it well-kept? - Yes.

1515
00:52:21,921 --> 00:52:24,489
If you keep it for a while, it'll be worth it...

1516
00:52:24,490 --> 00:52:26,177
to take to a museum.

1517
00:52:27,591 --> 00:52:29,460
(It's extremely valuable.)

1518
00:52:29,461 --> 00:52:30,659
- Really? - Yes.

1519
00:52:30,660 --> 00:52:32,114
For how long do you have to keep it?

1520
00:52:32,401 --> 00:52:33,900
It should be kept for over 50 years.

1521
00:52:33,901 --> 00:52:36,040
(It should be kept for over 50 years.)

1522
00:52:36,041 --> 00:52:37,283
- 10,050 years? - 50 years?

1523
00:52:37,401 --> 00:52:39,670
- About 50 years. - Right.

1524
00:52:39,671 --> 00:52:41,610
It'll be when Sang Yeob hands it...

1525
00:52:41,611 --> 00:52:42,853
down to his children.

1526
00:52:43,780 --> 00:52:46,079
- That's unfortunate. - It's okay.

1527
00:52:46,080 --> 00:52:48,778
(Team Jong Kook's appraisal is done.)

1528
00:52:48,981 --> 00:52:53,061
(Team Jong Kook's total: 526 dollars)

1529
00:52:53,321 --> 00:52:54,664
It's our turn.

1530
00:52:54,821 --> 00:52:56,376
We have antiques too.

1531
00:52:56,660 --> 00:52:59,286
I gave my cut-out for this.

1532
00:53:00,361 --> 00:53:01,790
- What's this? - This is...

1533
00:53:01,791 --> 00:53:03,144
It's very popular these days.

1534
00:53:03,231 --> 00:53:05,570
He brought this album.

1535
00:53:05,571 --> 00:53:06,699
(What is the item that he swapped his cut-out with?)

1536
00:53:06,700 --> 00:53:08,369
(LP record by Queen appears.)

1537
00:53:08,370 --> 00:53:09,885
It's an LP record by Queen.

1538
00:53:10,370 --> 00:53:11,840
(That's unbelievable.)

1539
00:53:11,841 --> 00:53:13,053
How did you get it?

1540
00:53:13,441 --> 00:53:16,540
(People get excited as they see Queen's album.)

1541
00:53:16,541 --> 00:53:18,873
- I saw this movie. - I see.

1542
00:53:18,910 --> 00:53:21,110
I found it terrible.

1543
00:53:21,111 --> 00:53:23,480
(This movie was terrible.)

1544
00:53:23,481 --> 00:53:25,400
Wait, was it terrible?

1545
00:53:25,591 --> 00:53:27,320
- It was terrible? - He was wearing a tank top.

1546
00:53:27,321 --> 00:53:29,138
It created a sensation all over the world.

1547
00:53:29,321 --> 00:53:32,529
It's a man who sings in a tank top.

1548
00:53:32,530 --> 00:53:35,389
Yes, but don't you know Freddie Mercury?

1549
00:53:35,390 --> 00:53:38,663
I know him, but he isn't my type.

1550
00:53:39,071 --> 00:53:40,848
What about as a recyclable?

1551
00:53:40,901 --> 00:53:42,170
I swapped it with cut-out.

1552
00:53:42,171 --> 00:53:43,369
- It's Queen's... - I'll weigh it.

1553
00:53:43,370 --> 00:53:44,570
- What are you doing? - Don't weigh it.

1554
00:53:44,571 --> 00:53:47,197
(I'll weigh it.)

1555
00:53:47,671 --> 00:53:49,279
(What are you doing?)

1556
00:53:49,280 --> 00:53:50,654
- What are you doing? - Don't weigh it.

1557
00:53:51,041 --> 00:53:54,110
What are you doing? You can't put it there.

1558
00:53:54,111 --> 00:53:56,349
- That's impossible. - That's harsh.

1559
00:53:56,350 --> 00:53:58,846
The whole world is crazy about Queen right now.

1560
00:53:59,050 --> 00:54:01,212
He puts everything on the scale.

1561
00:54:01,350 --> 00:54:03,520
Let's find out the price. Please turn it around.

1562
00:54:03,521 --> 00:54:05,814
(What's the price for LP record by Queen?)

1563
00:54:07,231 --> 00:54:08,442
- 40 dollars. - 40 dollars?

1564
00:54:09,160 --> 00:54:12,402
- We're satisfied with it. - Yes.

1565
00:54:13,030 --> 00:54:14,670
Does Team Jae Seok have two items?

1566
00:54:14,671 --> 00:54:15,710
No, we have one more.

1567
00:54:15,970 --> 00:54:18,597
(We have one more.)

1568
00:54:19,041 --> 00:54:21,293
- Do you have one more? - What did you change it to?

1569
00:54:21,671 --> 00:54:23,700
In the world... Be careful.

1570
00:54:23,740 --> 00:54:25,279
It could cause a sensation in the world.

1571
00:54:25,280 --> 00:54:27,936
Then why did you bring it in a plastic bag?

1572
00:54:27,981 --> 00:54:29,232
- Isn't that harsh? - Wait.

1573
00:54:29,780 --> 00:54:31,920
(Is the worldwide item inside a plastic bag?)

1574
00:54:31,921 --> 00:54:33,349
This is how people carry things in Dongmyo.

1575
00:54:33,350 --> 00:54:35,489
- He said it's a worldwide item. - Everyone hangs it on the wrist...

1576
00:54:35,490 --> 00:54:36,889
and carries it like this.

1577
00:54:36,890 --> 00:54:39,113
- Isn't it a worldwide item? - It's how it's done in Dongmyo.

1578
00:54:39,330 --> 00:54:40,371
Listen.

1579
00:54:40,961 --> 00:54:44,163
We're very careful about it.

1580
00:54:44,530 --> 00:54:45,540
What is it?

1581
00:54:46,330 --> 00:54:47,699
- Is it a brazier? - Is it incense burner?

1582
00:54:47,700 --> 00:54:49,519
Even the seller didn't know its value.

1583
00:54:49,571 --> 00:54:51,770
He gave it to us for the price that we asked for.

1584
00:54:51,771 --> 00:54:52,982
It's rusty.

1585
00:54:54,211 --> 00:54:55,639
- It means it's old. - Right.

1586
00:54:55,640 --> 00:54:56,650
(It looks more than 100 years old.)

1587
00:54:56,780 --> 00:54:58,357
He turned on the flashlight.

1588
00:54:58,481 --> 00:55:00,530
- Finally, he turned on the light. - He turned on the flashlight.

1589
00:55:01,280 --> 00:55:02,331
It should be weighed.

1590
00:55:03,381 --> 00:55:04,664
It should be tested with the magnet.

1591
00:55:05,080 --> 00:55:08,050
Sir, could you try and see if the magnet gets stuck?

1592
00:55:08,220 --> 00:55:09,219
Yes.

1593
00:55:09,220 --> 00:55:12,422
(The magnet sticks.)

1594
00:55:12,990 --> 00:55:14,590
(The magnet is...)

1595
00:55:14,591 --> 00:55:16,400
(stuck.)

1596
00:55:16,401 --> 00:55:17,472
Don't stick it.

1597
00:55:18,061 --> 00:55:19,570
- It sticks. - Don't stick it.

1598
00:55:19,571 --> 00:55:21,170
- Don't stick it. - Take it off.

1599
00:55:21,171 --> 00:55:22,555
- Come on. - Take it off now.

1600
00:55:22,841 --> 00:55:25,841
- Why would you stick the magnet? - Why would you?

1601
00:55:26,111 --> 00:55:27,639
- Why? - The sound was clear.

1602
00:55:27,640 --> 00:55:29,459
It could be a cultural asset.

1603
00:55:30,180 --> 00:55:32,250
- I was startled. - The magnet got stuck.

1604
00:55:32,251 --> 00:55:33,549
I was startled.

1605
00:55:33,550 --> 00:55:34,662
(He continues to appraise it carefully.)

1606
00:55:35,751 --> 00:55:37,449
- I'm curious about its value. - Me too.

1607
00:55:37,450 --> 00:55:39,520
(Those who are watching)

1608
00:55:39,521 --> 00:55:42,790
(Those who brought it)

1609
00:55:42,791 --> 00:55:45,960
(Everyone is curious.)

1610
00:55:45,961 --> 00:55:49,838
(How much is the item from Dongmyo worth?)

1611
00:55:51,861 --> 00:55:52,869
It's two dollars.

1612
00:55:52,870 --> 00:55:54,991
(2 dollars?)

1613
00:55:55,200 --> 00:55:57,840
(There must be an error.)

1614
00:55:57,841 --> 00:56:00,469
I knew it since you brought it in this bag.

1615
00:56:00,470 --> 00:56:02,461
- What is it? - Wait a minute.

1616
00:56:02,740 --> 00:56:03,953
- Why? - Listen.

1617
00:56:04,111 --> 00:56:05,968
We bought it for 13 dollars.

1618
00:56:06,381 --> 00:56:07,693
Isn't it quite old?

1619
00:56:08,111 --> 00:56:10,579
- It's about 10 years old. - 10 years?

1620
00:56:10,580 --> 00:56:11,894
(It's about 10 years old.)

1621
00:56:12,080 --> 00:56:14,290
- 10 years? - How is it so rusty?

1622
00:56:14,291 --> 00:56:16,512
- It's 10 years old. - Is it 10 years old?

1623
00:56:17,220 --> 00:56:19,179
Was it made when Running Man started?

1624
00:56:20,361 --> 00:56:22,560
It's made with iron, so when 10 years pass,

1625
00:56:22,561 --> 00:56:23,610
it gets damaged.

1626
00:56:24,030 --> 00:56:27,363
The total price is 742 dollars. It's the highest total.

1627
00:56:27,731 --> 00:56:28,982
742 dollars?

1628
00:56:29,271 --> 00:56:31,670
- I'm glad that we kept the guitar. - We did the right thing.

1629
00:56:31,671 --> 00:56:32,721
(We returned the items after the shoot.)

1630
00:56:33,711 --> 00:56:36,739
We'll start Unboxing Auction.

1631
00:56:36,740 --> 00:56:38,840
- What is unboxing? - What does unboxing mean?

1632
00:56:38,841 --> 00:56:41,779
It's an auction that takes place...

1633
00:56:41,780 --> 00:56:44,407
while we remove items from their boxes.

1634
00:56:45,720 --> 00:56:48,317
Gosh. He's an insider.

1635
00:56:48,490 --> 00:56:49,590
- He is. - Look behind you.

1636
00:56:49,591 --> 00:56:52,086
You'll see 50 boxes.

1637
00:56:52,490 --> 00:56:54,682
There are 40 types of items.

1638
00:56:54,731 --> 00:56:57,500
There are cellphones in 10 of them.

1639
00:56:57,501 --> 00:56:58,630
(There are cellphones in 10 of the boxes.)

1640
00:56:58,631 --> 00:56:59,842
- Cellphones? - Yes.

1641
00:57:00,830 --> 00:57:03,340
In 10 cellphones, there are 2 different instructions.

1642
00:57:03,341 --> 00:57:05,795
1 type of instruction is written on 5 cellphones.

1643
00:57:06,111 --> 00:57:08,091
Find cellphones with different instructions written on them.

1644
00:57:08,140 --> 00:57:09,779
Combine the sentences...

1645
00:57:09,780 --> 00:57:11,980
and clear the mission. Then you can go home.

1646
00:57:11,981 --> 00:57:13,210
(It's important to find cellphones with instructions written on them.)

1647
00:57:13,211 --> 00:57:15,332
- There are so many. - We have to find the instructions.

1648
00:57:15,580 --> 00:57:17,849
Discuss and decide which box...

1649
00:57:17,850 --> 00:57:19,506
- you'd like to start. - Shall we open a big box?

1650
00:57:19,651 --> 00:57:21,338
- All right. - Let's open up a big one.

1651
00:57:22,421 --> 00:57:24,060
- There's one in the back. - Seok Jin.

1652
00:57:24,061 --> 00:57:25,190
Hand it to me.

1653
00:57:25,191 --> 00:57:26,960
(Could it be in such a big box?)

1654
00:57:26,961 --> 00:57:27,971
This is great.

1655
00:57:28,361 --> 00:57:29,916
This is almost...

1656
00:57:29,961 --> 00:57:31,400
- It's in 1 of the 2. - It's very long.

1657
00:57:31,401 --> 00:57:33,670
Would you like to start with the big box?

1658
00:57:33,671 --> 00:57:35,691
- We'll start with a dollar. - One dollar.

1659
00:57:36,300 --> 00:57:37,840
- Jae Seok called a dollar. - Two dollars.

1660
00:57:37,841 --> 00:57:38,940
- 2 dollars. - 3 dollars.

1661
00:57:38,941 --> 00:57:40,688
3 dollars. 3 dollars?

1662
00:57:40,841 --> 00:57:42,285
- 4 dollars? - 5 dollars.

1663
00:57:42,841 --> 00:57:44,679
You can increase it by a lot.

1664
00:57:44,680 --> 00:57:46,049
13 dollars.

1665
00:57:46,050 --> 00:57:47,480
(Is he destroying his team?)

1666
00:57:47,481 --> 00:57:48,779
- Seok Jin. No. - 13 dollars?

1667
00:57:48,780 --> 00:57:51,648
- He doesn't have the right. - 13 dollars? Okay.

1668
00:57:51,680 --> 00:57:53,420
- 13 dollars? - We didn't call 13 dollars.

1669
00:57:53,421 --> 00:57:54,650
- How about 10 dollars? - 13 dollars?

1670
00:57:54,651 --> 00:57:56,389
- No. - Is 13 dollars the last call?

1671
00:57:56,390 --> 00:57:58,060
No, no.

1672
00:57:58,061 --> 00:58:00,889
20 dollars? We have 20 dollars.

1673
00:58:00,890 --> 00:58:02,244
- See? - 20 dollars?

1674
00:58:02,501 --> 00:58:04,860
- It could contain the instruction. - Right.

1675
00:58:04,861 --> 00:58:07,829
20 dollars? Anyone else? 1, 2, 3.

1676
00:58:08,470 --> 00:58:09,540
20 dollars? Okay.

1677
00:58:09,541 --> 00:58:11,639
(Team Jae Seok wins at 20 dollars.)

1678
00:58:11,640 --> 00:58:13,869
- We'll pay 20 dollars. - I wonder what's inside.

1679
00:58:13,870 --> 00:58:15,254
- This is why people watch unboxing. - Let's see.

1680
00:58:15,370 --> 00:58:16,980
- Unbox it now. - It'd be amazing if they get it.

1681
00:58:16,981 --> 00:58:18,079
That would be amazing.

1682
00:58:18,080 --> 00:58:20,000
(What will be in the first box?)

1683
00:58:20,850 --> 00:58:22,449
(What?)

1684
00:58:22,450 --> 00:58:24,441
(There's something inside.)

1685
00:58:25,220 --> 00:58:26,230
I told you that there was something inside.

1686
00:58:26,291 --> 00:58:29,522
(They find a cellphone and a mission card.)

1687
00:58:30,091 --> 00:58:31,939
Go to the gallery and check the instructions.

1688
00:58:32,120 --> 00:58:33,141
Were they inside?

1689
00:58:33,530 --> 00:58:36,259
(They can't believe that they found it in the first box.)

1690
00:58:36,260 --> 00:58:38,452
- Were they inside? - This is annoying.

1691
00:58:38,861 --> 00:58:40,245
We got it for 20 dollars.

1692
00:58:41,330 --> 00:58:43,340
- Seriously. - Were they inside?

1693
00:58:43,341 --> 00:58:44,699
(They get a cellphone with instructions.)

1694
00:58:44,700 --> 00:58:47,135
- That's amazing. - Go to the gallery.

1695
00:58:47,171 --> 00:58:48,469
Check the instructions.

1696
00:58:48,470 --> 00:58:50,610
- Okay. - I had a good feeling about it.

1697
00:58:50,611 --> 00:58:51,621
(What instructions will they find?)

1698
00:58:52,311 --> 00:58:54,880
(The sole of your left foot)

1699
00:58:54,881 --> 00:58:57,849
(What does it mean?)

1700
00:58:57,850 --> 00:58:59,150
(The sole of your left foot)

1701
00:58:59,151 --> 00:59:00,889
(Mysterious)

1702
00:59:00,890 --> 00:59:02,103
I see.

1703
00:59:02,561 --> 00:59:03,874
Is there something?

1704
00:59:04,220 --> 00:59:05,929
- One isn't enough. - You can't know with one.

1705
00:59:05,930 --> 00:59:06,960
You need to find both.

1706
00:59:06,961 --> 00:59:08,708
- We need to find them. - Then we have to connect them.

1707
00:59:09,361 --> 00:59:10,630
Let's stay put.

1708
00:59:10,631 --> 00:59:13,070
- Keep it a secret. - Did you find something?

1709
00:59:13,071 --> 00:59:15,170
- Is there something written on it? - But...

1710
00:59:15,171 --> 00:59:18,369
(Someone becomes impatient as unlucky brothers do well.)

1711
00:59:18,370 --> 00:59:19,670
What are you doing, Seok Jin?

1712
00:59:19,671 --> 00:59:20,770
We'll know if we find one more.

1713
00:59:20,771 --> 00:59:22,340
- I have a good feeling about it. - Do you?

1714
00:59:22,341 --> 00:59:25,110
Seok Jin brought a box. Shall we proceed with it?

1715
00:59:25,111 --> 00:59:27,069
- Yes, how about this? - Okay, let's go.

1716
00:59:27,251 --> 00:59:28,694
We'll start the auction.

1717
00:59:28,950 --> 00:59:30,920
- 15 dollars. - We have 15 dollars.

1718
00:59:30,921 --> 00:59:32,489
- 30 dollars. - 30 dollars.

1719
00:59:32,490 --> 00:59:33,690
- They have a lot of money. - 38 dollars.

1720
00:59:33,691 --> 00:59:35,750
- 38 dollars. - We'll raise it to 50 dollars.

1721
00:59:35,751 --> 00:59:37,060
50 dollars? 50 dollars.

1722
00:59:37,061 --> 00:59:38,707
- 52 dollars. - 52 dollars.

1723
00:59:38,760 --> 00:59:40,346
- 60 dollars. - 60 dollars.

1724
00:59:40,631 --> 00:59:42,500
- 60 dollars is a lot. - 62 dollars.

1725
00:59:42,501 --> 00:59:44,521
- 62 dollars. - It's expensive.

1726
00:59:45,061 --> 00:59:47,369
62 dollars, 1, 2...

1727
00:59:47,370 --> 00:59:48,441
64 dollars.

1728
00:59:48,470 --> 00:59:50,639
(64 dollars)

1729
00:59:50,640 --> 00:59:52,070
- We called 62 dollars. - 64 dollars.

1730
00:59:52,071 --> 00:59:53,670
(Why did he increase his own price?)

1731
00:59:53,671 --> 00:59:55,170
We called 62 dollars.

1732
00:59:55,171 --> 00:59:56,480
- Seok Jin, we called 62 dollars. - Why?

1733
00:59:56,481 --> 00:59:59,006
That was our price. What's wrong with you?

1734
00:59:59,041 --> 01:00:01,605
- He's an auction machine. - 62 dollars is enough.

1735
01:00:01,680 --> 01:00:03,779
- What's wrong with you? - Don't say anything.

1736
01:00:03,780 --> 01:00:05,420
- There's definitely a cellphone. - 1, 2.

1737
01:00:05,421 --> 01:00:06,905
- 70 dollars. - 70 dollars.

1738
01:00:07,151 --> 01:00:09,281
We have 70 dollars. Is there more than 70?

1739
01:00:09,321 --> 01:00:11,489
- 1, 2. - 73 dollars.

1740
01:00:11,490 --> 01:00:12,489
73 dollars.

1741
01:00:12,490 --> 01:00:13,630
Just increase it by two dollars.

1742
01:00:13,631 --> 01:00:16,085
I want you to go beyond yourself.

1743
01:00:16,430 --> 01:00:17,599
- Is there 74 dollars? - 76 dollars.

1744
01:00:17,600 --> 01:00:19,060
He's my role model indeed.

1745
01:00:19,061 --> 01:00:20,545
(He goes beyond himself.)

1746
01:00:21,430 --> 01:00:23,995
That's not how you do it. Don't listen to others.

1747
01:00:24,441 --> 01:00:25,670
- 80 dollars. - 80 dollars?

1748
01:00:25,671 --> 01:00:27,139
- Come on. - He's like Usain Bolt.

1749
01:00:27,140 --> 01:00:28,540
He breaks his own records.

1750
01:00:28,541 --> 01:00:31,079
It's better to raise it high all of a sudden.

1751
01:00:31,080 --> 01:00:33,070
- 80 dollars? 1, 2. - 80 dollars.

1752
01:00:34,080 --> 01:00:35,121
Three.

1753
01:00:35,481 --> 01:00:36,679
I can't go over 80 dollars.

1754
01:00:36,680 --> 01:00:38,420
(Team Seok Jin wins at 80 dollars.)

1755
01:00:38,421 --> 01:00:41,480
Seok Jin picked the box himself.

1756
01:00:41,521 --> 01:00:42,732
We can't go over 80 dollars.

1757
01:00:42,791 --> 01:00:44,710
I hope he'll find a brick inside.

1758
01:00:46,461 --> 01:00:49,159
(What is inside Team Seok Jin's first box?)

1759
01:00:49,160 --> 01:00:50,170
Okay.

1760
01:00:50,731 --> 01:00:53,901
(Is there a cellphone as Seok Jin predicted?)

1761
01:00:54,571 --> 01:00:55,570
What is it?

1762
01:00:55,571 --> 01:00:56,739
(There seems to be something inside.)

1763
01:00:56,740 --> 01:00:57,770
What is it?

1764
01:00:57,771 --> 01:00:59,940
(Is there another cellphone?)

1765
01:00:59,941 --> 01:01:01,021
What is it?

1766
01:01:01,041 --> 01:01:02,139
(Inside the box...)

1767
01:01:02,140 --> 01:01:03,340
- Wait. - There's something.

1768
01:01:03,341 --> 01:01:04,794
- What is it? - Wait.

1769
01:01:06,180 --> 01:01:07,880
"Guess what this item is used for."

1770
01:01:07,881 --> 01:01:09,150
"The team that wins this box..."

1771
01:01:09,151 --> 01:01:11,473
"has the right to answer the question first."

1772
01:01:11,580 --> 01:01:13,389
"If the team answers correctly,"

1773
01:01:13,390 --> 01:01:14,664
"they're paid two times more than the auction price."

1774
01:01:14,890 --> 01:01:16,290
"If the team doesn't answer correctly,"

1775
01:01:16,291 --> 01:01:17,705
"other teams get a chance to answer."

1776
01:01:17,890 --> 01:01:19,090
"If another team answers,"

1777
01:01:19,091 --> 01:01:21,384
"the auction price will be paid to the team."

1778
01:01:21,490 --> 01:01:23,420
This is the item.

1779
01:01:23,631 --> 01:01:24,670
What is it?

1780
01:01:24,800 --> 01:01:26,299
Do we guess what this is?

1781
01:01:26,300 --> 01:01:27,412
- Yes. - Let's see.

1782
01:01:27,930 --> 01:01:28,940
What is it?

1783
01:01:30,571 --> 01:01:33,509
Why did you buy it for 80 dollars?

1784
01:01:33,510 --> 01:01:35,289
If we answer correctly, we win 160 dollars.

1785
01:01:35,410 --> 01:01:36,509
Do we guess what it is?

1786
01:01:36,510 --> 01:01:38,096
- Yes. - I know.

1787
01:01:38,140 --> 01:01:39,909
- I think it's used this way. - What?

1788
01:01:39,910 --> 01:01:42,374
- Is it a mousepad? - Is it?

1789
01:01:42,751 --> 01:01:44,520
- Mouse? - It's for the mouse.

1790
01:01:44,521 --> 01:01:46,368
It can't be used as a mouse pad.

1791
01:01:46,421 --> 01:01:48,420
Isn't it used for bowling?

1792
01:01:48,421 --> 01:01:49,704
Do you put it on like this?

1793
01:01:50,861 --> 01:01:52,590
- Is it used for bowling? - That's amazing.

1794
01:01:52,591 --> 01:01:54,329
He's so smart.

1795
01:01:54,330 --> 01:01:55,977
(He tries to make Seok Jin believe him.)

1796
01:01:56,700 --> 01:01:59,000
He's gullible. Don't say things like that.

1797
01:01:59,001 --> 01:02:01,555
- That's amazing. - He's very clever.

1798
01:02:01,870 --> 01:02:04,598
- Give me your answer in 10 seconds. - What does it say?

1799
01:02:05,240 --> 01:02:07,040
10, 9.

1800
01:02:07,041 --> 01:02:08,525
(What does Team Seok Jin think it is?)

1801
01:02:09,841 --> 01:02:10,851
Seven.

1802
01:02:10,981 --> 01:02:12,496
(It's used for sports.)

1803
01:02:12,680 --> 01:02:13,949
- Five. - This is our answer.

1804
01:02:13,950 --> 01:02:15,496
It's to prevent your cellphone from slipping.

1805
01:02:16,080 --> 01:02:18,219
Is it a pad that is used to prevent your cellphone...

1806
01:02:18,220 --> 01:02:20,342
- from slipping? - Yes.

1807
01:02:20,390 --> 01:02:21,420
Is that your answer?

1808
01:02:21,421 --> 01:02:23,037
(Does it prevent the cellphone from slipping?)

1809
01:02:24,191 --> 01:02:25,201
Is that correct?

1810
01:02:25,791 --> 01:02:27,259
- You failed. - It's wrong.

1811
01:02:27,260 --> 01:02:28,690
(Team Seok Jin's answer is wrong.)

1812
01:02:28,691 --> 01:02:30,378
- Let me answer. - Let me answer.

1813
01:02:30,530 --> 01:02:31,560
Team Haha.

1814
01:02:31,561 --> 01:02:32,630
When you're exercising,

1815
01:02:32,631 --> 01:02:34,287
you put it on so that you don't get any callus.

1816
01:02:34,901 --> 01:02:36,099
Then you grab the weight.

1817
01:02:36,100 --> 01:02:37,555
If Team Haha answers correctly,

1818
01:02:37,941 --> 01:02:40,062
they'll take 80 dollars.

1819
01:02:40,271 --> 01:02:41,987
Jong Kook said that...

1820
01:02:42,041 --> 01:02:44,040
it protects the hand while lifting weights.

1821
01:02:44,041 --> 01:02:45,380
(Team Jong Kook's answer is a pad to prevent calluses.)

1822
01:02:45,381 --> 01:02:46,409
You failed.

1823
01:02:46,410 --> 01:02:48,066
(Team Jong Kook's answer is wrong.)

1824
01:02:48,311 --> 01:02:49,533
Let us take a look.

1825
01:02:50,151 --> 01:02:52,140
- Isn't it a pad? - I have no idea what it is.

1826
01:02:52,950 --> 01:02:55,042
You put it on your finger and use it.

1827
01:02:55,091 --> 01:02:56,101
Put it on like this.

1828
01:02:57,220 --> 01:02:58,230
Kwang Soo.

1829
01:02:58,821 --> 01:02:59,860
It's the foot.

1830
01:02:59,861 --> 01:03:01,779
(He changes the thinking.)

1831
01:03:01,830 --> 01:03:02,840
Isn't it for the foot?

1832
01:03:03,330 --> 01:03:04,500
You're right.

1833
01:03:04,501 --> 01:03:05,500
He's smart.

1834
01:03:05,501 --> 01:03:06,630
It's for the foot.

1835
01:03:06,631 --> 01:03:08,953
- It's to prevent you from slipping. - It's a foot pad.

1836
01:03:09,571 --> 01:03:10,610
Foot pad.

1837
01:03:10,941 --> 01:03:13,210
Foot pad? What is it used for?

1838
01:03:13,211 --> 01:03:15,210
It could prevent from slipping...

1839
01:03:15,211 --> 01:03:17,159
or getting calluses.

1840
01:03:17,481 --> 01:03:19,400
- That's it. - It's made with silicon.

1841
01:03:19,580 --> 01:03:21,196
Pad for the sole.

1842
01:03:21,311 --> 01:03:22,360
Pad for the sole.

1843
01:03:23,450 --> 01:03:24,480
That's correct.

1844
01:03:24,481 --> 01:03:26,814
(Foot pad is the right answer.)

1845
01:03:27,291 --> 01:03:29,483
Kwang Soo. This is insane.

1846
01:03:30,061 --> 01:03:31,171
It's insane.

1847
01:03:31,461 --> 01:03:33,409
It was a pad for the foot.

1848
01:03:33,930 --> 01:03:35,204
That's right.

1849
01:03:36,160 --> 01:03:37,159
Goodness.

1850
01:03:37,160 --> 01:03:38,829
- Kwang Soo. - Let's escape.

1851
01:03:38,830 --> 01:03:40,329
(After getting a cellphone, Team Jae Seok gets another chance.)

1852
01:03:40,330 --> 01:03:42,869
Team Jae Seok had a lot of money from the start.

1853
01:03:42,870 --> 01:03:44,070
(I went beyond my limit, but Jae Seok takes the money.)

1854
01:03:44,071 --> 01:03:45,369
- We keep winning. - Let's go.

1855
01:03:45,370 --> 01:03:46,570
You got it right for 20 dollars.

1856
01:03:46,571 --> 01:03:47,823
(I have a good feeling about today.)

1857
01:03:48,171 --> 01:03:49,579
- This is it. - There are 10.

1858
01:03:49,580 --> 01:03:50,590
- We should get one of them. - Let's get it right.

1859
01:03:51,010 --> 01:03:52,051
Let's get it right.

1860
01:03:52,580 --> 01:03:54,732
We'll proceed with this box.

1861
01:03:55,251 --> 01:03:56,462
20 dollars.

1862
01:03:56,481 --> 01:03:57,692
- 20 dollars. - 20 dollars.

1863
01:03:58,050 --> 01:03:59,636
- 20 dollars. - 26 dollars.

1864
01:03:59,950 --> 01:04:01,708
- 20? 26 dollars. - 26 dollars.

1865
01:04:01,950 --> 01:04:03,203
- 30 dollars. - 30 dollars.

1866
01:04:03,260 --> 01:04:05,007
- 32 dollars. - 32 dollars.

1867
01:04:05,191 --> 01:04:06,645
- 40 dollars. - 40 dollars.

1868
01:04:06,830 --> 01:04:08,389
- I call 50 dollars. - 50 dollars.

1869
01:04:08,390 --> 01:04:09,673
- Right. - We have 50 dollars.

1870
01:04:09,731 --> 01:04:12,053
- 80 dollars. - 80 dollars.

1871
01:04:12,260 --> 01:04:13,270
80 dollars?

1872
01:04:13,271 --> 01:04:14,699
(So Min calls 80 dollars.)

1873
01:04:14,700 --> 01:04:17,170
- 90 dollars. - Team Jae Seok called 90 dollars.

1874
01:04:17,171 --> 01:04:18,369
100 dollars.

1875
01:04:18,370 --> 01:04:19,521
- 100 dollars. - Yes.

1876
01:04:19,640 --> 01:04:20,681
Why am I getting angry?

1877
01:04:21,441 --> 01:04:23,258
- 100 dollars. - Let's stop.

1878
01:04:24,240 --> 01:04:26,776
100 dollars, 1, 2, 3.

1879
01:04:27,180 --> 01:04:29,210
(Team Jong Kook picks the third box.)

1880
01:04:29,211 --> 01:04:30,579
(Team Jong Kook wins at 100 dollars.)

1881
01:04:30,580 --> 01:04:31,630
- Okay. - Let's go.

1882
01:04:33,021 --> 01:04:34,049
Okay.

1883
01:04:34,050 --> 01:04:35,219
- It'll definitely be in it. - This is it.

1884
01:04:35,220 --> 01:04:36,372
(What is in the third box?)

1885
01:04:36,990 --> 01:04:40,525
(Cellphone? Chance?)

1886
01:04:41,160 --> 01:04:42,329
I hope they get mud.

1887
01:04:42,330 --> 01:04:44,279
- We pick the box next time. - Okay.

1888
01:04:44,861 --> 01:04:46,588
(Curious)

1889
01:04:47,901 --> 01:04:49,369
(She opens the box.)

1890
01:04:49,370 --> 01:04:52,329
(There's something inside.)

1891
01:04:53,470 --> 01:04:54,509
Is it a cellphone?

1892
01:04:54,510 --> 01:04:55,651
(Is it another cellphone?)

1893
01:04:57,041 --> 01:04:59,302
See? I told you.

1894
01:04:59,850 --> 01:05:02,210
(There's a cellphone inside.)

1895
01:05:02,211 --> 01:05:03,380
Really?

1896
01:05:03,381 --> 01:05:05,775
See? I told you that I had a good feeling about it.

1897
01:05:05,821 --> 01:05:07,033
Didn't I tell you?

1898
01:05:07,490 --> 01:05:08,703
You two are amazing.

1899
01:05:09,251 --> 01:05:12,049
- I should have kept going. - It's disappointing.

1900
01:05:12,390 --> 01:05:14,730
There are only 10 out of 50 boxes.

1901
01:05:14,731 --> 01:05:16,130
It's unfortunate.

1902
01:05:16,131 --> 01:05:17,699
If I called a higher price, we'd have gotten it.

1903
01:05:17,700 --> 01:05:20,457
(What's the set of instructions written on the cellphone?)

1904
01:05:20,970 --> 01:05:23,270
(Is it the same as what Team Jae Seok found?)

1905
01:05:23,271 --> 01:05:26,099
(Or is it a new set of instructions?)

1906
01:05:27,410 --> 01:05:29,440
(Unfortunately, they got the same instruction as Team Jae Seok.)

1907
01:05:29,441 --> 01:05:31,026
- Okay. - What does it mean?

1908
01:05:31,211 --> 01:05:33,432
- I know. - We need the second set.

1909
01:05:33,510 --> 01:05:36,106
They could have the same set of instructions.

1910
01:05:36,251 --> 01:05:37,261
Jong Kook.

1911
01:05:37,321 --> 01:05:38,795
We'll start the auction with a dollar.

1912
01:05:38,821 --> 01:05:39,961
- I'm getting this one. - Which team will it be?

1913
01:05:40,050 --> 01:05:41,435
- 30 dollars. - 30 dollars.

1914
01:05:41,490 --> 01:05:42,549
- 50 dollars. - 50 dollars.

1915
01:05:42,550 --> 01:05:43,920
- Goodness. - 60 dollars.

1916
01:05:43,921 --> 01:05:44,989
60 dollars?

1917
01:05:44,990 --> 01:05:46,429
- They have a lot. - 60 dollars?

1918
01:05:46,430 --> 01:05:47,905
- 80 dollars. - 80 dollars.

1919
01:05:48,061 --> 01:05:49,259
- 100 dollars. - All right.

1920
01:05:49,260 --> 01:05:50,799
That's too high.

1921
01:05:50,800 --> 01:05:52,630
We have to open a box.

1922
01:05:52,631 --> 01:05:54,029
Why did you increase it all of a sudden?

1923
01:05:54,030 --> 01:05:55,329
- 120 dollars. - 120 dollars.

1924
01:05:55,330 --> 01:05:57,040
(Team Jae Seok keeps other teams in check.)

1925
01:05:57,041 --> 01:05:58,699
- They're so certain. - Team Jae Seok called 120 dollars.

1926
01:05:58,700 --> 01:06:00,409
- 125 dollars. - 125 dollars.

1927
01:06:00,410 --> 01:06:01,840
Se Chan called 125 dollars.

1928
01:06:01,841 --> 01:06:02,980
128 dollars.

1929
01:06:02,981 --> 01:06:05,233
My goodness. I called it.

1930
01:06:05,541 --> 01:06:07,179
You're annoying me.

1931
01:06:07,180 --> 01:06:09,473
He likes to call higher than himself during the auction.

1932
01:06:09,821 --> 01:06:11,549
He punches his own face and passes out.

1933
01:06:11,550 --> 01:06:13,844
(It's the best comparison.)

1934
01:06:14,220 --> 01:06:15,449
128 dollars. 1.

1935
01:06:15,450 --> 01:06:16,976
- 100. - 2.

1936
01:06:17,021 --> 01:06:18,071
130 dollars.

1937
01:06:18,191 --> 01:06:19,645
130 dollars.

1938
01:06:20,131 --> 01:06:21,170
138 dollars.

1939
01:06:21,260 --> 01:06:22,947
- 138 dollars. - He doesn't listen to me.

1940
01:06:23,001 --> 01:06:24,818
- I'm sure about this. - Two.

1941
01:06:25,700 --> 01:06:26,811
- Three. - Okay.

1942
01:06:27,001 --> 01:06:28,130
138 dollars.

1943
01:06:28,131 --> 01:06:30,625
(Team Seok Jin wins at 138 dollars.)

1944
01:06:30,740 --> 01:06:31,750
It's taken.

1945
01:06:32,100 --> 01:06:33,139
I'll open it.

1946
01:06:33,140 --> 01:06:34,282
You don't have lucky hands.

1947
01:06:34,611 --> 01:06:36,560
(He opens the box.)

1948
01:06:37,240 --> 01:06:38,710
(There's something inside.)

1949
01:06:38,711 --> 01:06:39,791
I think they're doomed.

1950
01:06:40,180 --> 01:06:43,210
(It's a tangerine.)

1951
01:06:43,321 --> 01:06:44,331
Okay.

1952
01:06:44,620 --> 01:06:46,489
(No, there should be more.)

1953
01:06:46,490 --> 01:06:48,541
Good job, good job.

1954
01:06:49,220 --> 01:06:50,706
Good job, good job.

1955
01:06:51,620 --> 01:06:52,989
This is terrible.

1956
01:06:52,990 --> 01:06:54,489
It's a tangerine that cost 138 dollars.

1957
01:06:54,490 --> 01:06:56,278
Please enjoy it.

1958
01:06:56,430 --> 01:06:58,299
This is the charm of unboxing.

1959
01:06:58,300 --> 01:06:59,372
- Yes. - Of course.

1960
01:06:59,600 --> 01:07:01,500
Seok Jin is good at auctions.

1961
01:07:01,501 --> 01:07:03,040
He paid 80 dollars for a foot pad...

1962
01:07:03,041 --> 01:07:04,500
and 138 dollars for a tangerine.

1963
01:07:04,501 --> 01:07:05,915
(He wins 80-dollar foot pad and 138-dollar tangerine.)

1964
01:07:06,171 --> 01:07:08,369
- I'll try this. - Okay.

1965
01:07:08,370 --> 01:07:10,279
Next auction item is...

1966
01:07:10,280 --> 01:07:12,199
quite big.

1967
01:07:12,441 --> 01:07:14,210
We'll start the auction.

1968
01:07:14,211 --> 01:07:15,579
(What kind of item will be inside?)

1969
01:07:15,580 --> 01:07:17,439
- We bid 80 dollars. - What?

1970
01:07:18,381 --> 01:07:20,150
Kwang Soo bid 80 dollars.

1971
01:07:20,151 --> 01:07:21,231
- 80 dollars? - 80 dollars.

1972
01:07:21,321 --> 01:07:22,937
- Let's stop. - One.

1973
01:07:22,990 --> 01:07:24,000
Two.

1974
01:07:24,461 --> 01:07:26,409
3. It's 80 dollars.

1975
01:07:26,561 --> 01:07:28,106
- Okay. - Let's go.

1976
01:07:28,561 --> 01:07:30,599
(If they find the other set of instructions, the auction is over.)

1977
01:07:30,600 --> 01:07:32,549
He increased it up to 80 dollars all at once.

1978
01:07:35,470 --> 01:07:37,188
(What?)

1979
01:07:38,600 --> 01:07:40,009
- What is it? - Look at them.

1980
01:07:40,010 --> 01:07:41,670
- They're late. - They didn't get a cellphone.

1981
01:07:41,671 --> 01:07:43,296
(Is it a cellphone?)

1982
01:07:44,111 --> 01:07:46,849
(Inside the box is...)

1983
01:07:46,850 --> 01:07:47,980
80 dollars.

1984
01:07:47,981 --> 01:07:49,122
It's worth 80 dollars.

1985
01:07:49,350 --> 01:07:50,380
Delicious potato chips.

1986
01:07:50,381 --> 01:07:54,087
(They're potato chips instead of a cellphone.)

1987
01:07:54,720 --> 01:07:56,407
(Thank goodness)

1988
01:07:56,990 --> 01:07:59,546
(I thought it was a cellphone. That's unfortunate.)

1989
01:08:00,490 --> 01:08:01,529
I want some.

1990
01:08:01,530 --> 01:08:04,026
(Peekaboo)

1991
01:08:05,861 --> 01:08:08,969
(A snake that was hibernating appears.)

1992
01:08:08,970 --> 01:08:09,969
(That was surprising.)

1993
01:08:09,970 --> 01:08:11,011
It's a snake.

1994
01:08:11,841 --> 01:08:13,426
- I said that I wanted some. - That startled me.

1995
01:08:14,010 --> 01:08:15,040
This is upsetting.

1996
01:08:15,041 --> 01:08:16,182
This is upsetting.

1997
01:08:16,811 --> 01:08:17,921
Then...

1998
01:08:18,010 --> 01:08:19,009
how about this?

1999
01:08:19,010 --> 01:08:21,179
(The king of auction picks the sixth box.)

2000
01:08:21,180 --> 01:08:22,827
Have I ever been wrong?

2001
01:08:23,280 --> 01:08:24,836
We'll start the auction.

2002
01:08:25,321 --> 01:08:26,865
- We bid 30 dollars. - 30 dollars.

2003
01:08:27,120 --> 01:08:28,434
- 60 dollars. - 60 dollars.

2004
01:08:28,720 --> 01:08:29,790
63 dollars.

2005
01:08:29,791 --> 01:08:31,074
63 dollars.

2006
01:08:31,561 --> 01:08:33,408
- 65. - 65 dollars.

2007
01:08:33,590 --> 01:08:35,379
- 74. - 74 dollars. 1,

2008
01:08:35,491 --> 01:08:37,349
2, 3.

2009
01:08:37,831 --> 01:08:39,400
(Team Seok Jin wins at 74 dollars.)

2010
01:08:39,401 --> 01:08:40,499
Seok Jin picked...

2011
01:08:40,500 --> 01:08:41,870
- the box. - It has potential.

2012
01:08:41,871 --> 01:08:43,139
- This time... - We're sure.

2013
01:08:43,140 --> 01:08:44,252
Ji Hyo, you open it.

2014
01:08:44,371 --> 01:08:45,814
- Have some chips. - Why?

2015
01:08:47,640 --> 01:08:49,709
(Please fall for the trick.)

2016
01:08:49,710 --> 01:08:50,720
What?

2017
01:08:52,111 --> 01:08:54,939
(Peekaboo)

2018
01:08:56,821 --> 01:08:59,446
(It's so much fun to tease Seok Jin.)

2019
01:08:59,481 --> 01:09:00,520
Goodness.

2020
01:09:00,521 --> 01:09:02,450
(He calms down and focuses on unboxing.)

2021
01:09:02,451 --> 01:09:03,690
He got startled.

2022
01:09:03,691 --> 01:09:05,811
(He finds something.)

2023
01:09:06,430 --> 01:09:08,582
Seok Jin got startled by it.

2024
01:09:08,691 --> 01:09:09,690
He just got startled.

2025
01:09:09,691 --> 01:09:10,900
He got startled by this too.

2026
01:09:10,901 --> 01:09:13,669
(It's those potato chips again.)

2027
01:09:13,670 --> 01:09:14,943
He got startled by this too.

2028
01:09:15,500 --> 01:09:18,099
He got startled by this too.

2029
01:09:18,100 --> 01:09:19,454
(After being startled by the snake, he's startled by potato chips.)

2030
01:09:20,071 --> 01:09:23,111
(There were the same potato chips inside the box.)

2031
01:09:24,241 --> 01:09:25,756
It's so funny to see Seok Jin startled.

2032
01:09:27,010 --> 01:09:28,262
What's that box, sir?

2033
01:09:29,180 --> 01:09:30,849
There are two boxes.

2034
01:09:30,850 --> 01:09:32,219
- These? - You can choose them too.

2035
01:09:32,220 --> 01:09:34,371
What are those? They look special.

2036
01:09:34,521 --> 01:09:36,490
- I pick this one. - Please move it.

2037
01:09:36,491 --> 01:09:37,690
That's the box.

2038
01:09:37,691 --> 01:09:39,176
I shouldn't have said anything.

2039
01:09:39,991 --> 01:09:41,949
- Why was I curious? - It looks different.

2040
01:09:42,130 --> 01:09:43,140
We'll start the auction.

2041
01:09:43,760 --> 01:09:45,246
- 20 dollars. - 20 dollars.

2042
01:09:46,100 --> 01:09:47,212
60 dollars.

2043
01:09:47,271 --> 01:09:48,786
Team Haha bids 60 dollars.

2044
01:09:49,401 --> 01:09:50,440
I bid 100 dollars.

2045
01:09:50,441 --> 01:09:51,900
- 100 dollars? - Let's stay out of it.

2046
01:09:51,901 --> 01:09:52,940
- Let's stay out. - I agree.

2047
01:09:52,941 --> 01:09:53,969
It's 100 dollars in an instant.

2048
01:09:53,970 --> 01:09:55,810
They have a lot of money. Let them earn more.

2049
01:09:55,811 --> 01:09:57,296
- Okay. - 100 dollars?

2050
01:09:57,340 --> 01:09:59,198
- We'll stop. - 1, 2, 3.

2051
01:09:59,540 --> 01:10:02,237
(Team Jae Seok wins at 100 dollars.)

2052
01:10:02,581 --> 01:10:04,049
Please open it.

2053
01:10:04,050 --> 01:10:05,249
(What's inside the white box?)

2054
01:10:05,250 --> 01:10:06,280
1, 2.

2055
01:10:06,281 --> 01:10:08,239
(What's inside the white box?)

2056
01:10:08,821 --> 01:10:09,860
They get to choose again.

2057
01:10:09,861 --> 01:10:11,219
(There are three different boxes.)

2058
01:10:11,220 --> 01:10:12,230
What's this?

2059
01:10:12,361 --> 01:10:14,351
"Clear Lucky Box Mission."

2060
01:10:14,731 --> 01:10:17,226
"There's a Lucky Card in 1 of the 3 boxes."

2061
01:10:17,561 --> 01:10:18,743
"Dud in the other two boxes."

2062
01:10:19,130 --> 01:10:20,429
"If you pick the one with a Lucky Card,"

2063
01:10:20,430 --> 01:10:22,700
"you win two times your bidding amount."

2064
01:10:22,701 --> 01:10:23,940
(They win 2 times your bidding amount.)

2065
01:10:23,941 --> 01:10:25,099
It's two times the bidding amount.

2066
01:10:25,100 --> 01:10:27,091
I am not worried because both of them are unlucky.

2067
01:10:27,210 --> 01:10:28,339
I hope it's dud.

2068
01:10:28,340 --> 01:10:31,007
You and I will pick dud each.

2069
01:10:31,140 --> 01:10:33,150
- We'll pick the remaining one. - It'd be amazing if they get it.

2070
01:10:33,151 --> 01:10:35,610
- I'd respect them if they win. - Goodness.

2071
01:10:35,611 --> 01:10:36,661
Pick the one you want.

2072
01:10:36,821 --> 01:10:37,831
This one.

2073
01:10:38,180 --> 01:10:39,230
- You pick this one? - Yes.

2074
01:10:39,920 --> 01:10:42,243
- Take it out. - It's excluded.

2075
01:10:42,290 --> 01:10:44,482
Pick either 1 or 3.

2076
01:10:44,590 --> 01:10:48,089
(What will unlucky Jae Seok choose?)

2077
01:10:48,090 --> 01:10:49,343
I want to pick this one.

2078
01:10:49,790 --> 01:10:50,799
It's either 1 or 3.

2079
01:10:50,800 --> 01:10:51,999
- Please choose. - I'm confused.

2080
01:10:52,000 --> 01:10:53,141
I give you 10 seconds. 10,

2081
01:10:53,231 --> 01:10:55,049
9, 8, 7, 6.

2082
01:10:55,401 --> 01:10:56,411
Number three.

2083
01:10:57,271 --> 01:10:59,463
Number three is excluded.

2084
01:10:59,701 --> 01:11:01,458
We took out two duds.

2085
01:11:01,941 --> 01:11:03,910
- They picked number one. - Please.

2086
01:11:03,911 --> 01:11:04,910
One.

2087
01:11:04,911 --> 01:11:07,840
(Box 1 didn't get chosen by the unlucky brothers.)

2088
01:11:07,880 --> 01:11:09,879
In 1, 2...

2089
01:11:09,880 --> 01:11:12,445
(Will the unlucky brother's plan succeed?)

2090
01:11:13,121 --> 01:11:14,261
- The Lucky Card! - No way!

2091
01:11:15,050 --> 01:11:17,889
(They win the Lucky Card!)

2092
01:11:17,890 --> 01:11:19,607
- Are you serious? - My goodness.

2093
01:11:19,691 --> 01:11:21,681
They joined forces and found the Lucky Card.

2094
01:11:22,191 --> 01:11:23,860
- Unbelievable. - We picked two duds.

2095
01:11:23,861 --> 01:11:25,851
You and I... My goodness.

2096
01:11:26,100 --> 01:11:27,230
These are duds.

2097
01:11:27,231 --> 01:11:29,700
(The lucky brothers)

2098
01:11:29,701 --> 01:11:30,851
What is going on?

2099
01:11:31,441 --> 01:11:32,754
What is going on?

2100
01:11:33,470 --> 01:11:34,940
- We ruled these out. - This is incredible.

2101
01:11:34,941 --> 01:11:36,859
- Let's give them a big hand. - I got goosebumps.

2102
01:11:36,911 --> 01:11:38,379
(Haha got goosebumps.)

2103
01:11:38,380 --> 01:11:39,593
It's a good trick.

2104
01:11:39,951 --> 01:11:41,249
- No way. - It really is a good trick.

2105
01:11:41,250 --> 01:11:42,322
It's a good trick.

2106
01:11:42,510 --> 01:11:44,150
Two unlucky members turned the tables.

2107
01:11:44,151 --> 01:11:45,231
This is unbelievable.

2108
01:11:45,750 --> 01:11:47,406
This is crazy. This is unbelievable.

2109
01:11:48,121 --> 01:11:49,589
I am tearing up.

2110
01:11:49,590 --> 01:11:50,833
(He is moved.)

2111
01:11:50,991 --> 01:11:53,990
We will start the auction for this box.

2112
01:11:54,460 --> 01:11:56,190
- We bid 90 dollars. - 90 dollars.

2113
01:11:56,191 --> 01:11:57,499
- This is a disaster. - This is driving me crazy.

2114
01:11:57,500 --> 01:11:59,551
Kwang Soo bid 90 dollars. 1.

2115
01:12:00,470 --> 01:12:01,480
140 dollars.

2116
01:12:01,571 --> 01:12:03,519
- Haha bid 140 dollars. - 140 dollars.

2117
01:12:03,571 --> 01:12:05,389
- 150 dollars. - That's the highest bid.

2118
01:12:05,441 --> 01:12:06,652
This is driving me crazy.

2119
01:12:06,741 --> 01:12:07,781
152 dollars.

2120
01:12:08,771 --> 01:12:10,610
152 dollars. Seok Jin bid 152 dollars.

2121
01:12:10,611 --> 01:12:11,793
160 dollars.

2122
01:12:11,840 --> 01:12:13,980
- For goodness' sake. - It's the highest bid.

2123
01:12:13,981 --> 01:12:15,849
- 160 dollars. - Outbid us if you can.

2124
01:12:15,850 --> 01:12:17,538
- 160 dollars. - 165 dollars.

2125
01:12:17,651 --> 01:12:19,150
165 dollars.

2126
01:12:19,151 --> 01:12:20,150
180 dollars.

2127
01:12:20,151 --> 01:12:22,349
(How dare you!)

2128
01:12:22,350 --> 01:12:24,209
(My goodness.)

2129
01:12:24,390 --> 01:12:25,419
No, no.

2130
01:12:25,420 --> 01:12:26,419
(We can't outbid that.)

2131
01:12:26,420 --> 01:12:28,860
- 180 dollars. - 1, 2.

2132
01:12:28,861 --> 01:12:29,999
We shouldn't bid more.

2133
01:12:30,000 --> 01:12:30,999
Three.

2134
01:12:31,000 --> 01:12:32,230
That's a valuable box.

2135
01:12:32,231 --> 01:12:33,918
It seems that way.

2136
01:12:34,300 --> 01:12:35,499
That's a valuable box.

2137
01:12:35,500 --> 01:12:37,592
This is a 180-dollar box.

2138
01:12:37,901 --> 01:12:39,051
Please. Please.

2139
01:12:42,010 --> 01:12:43,082
- What? - Please.

2140
01:12:43,540 --> 01:12:44,810
(What?)

2141
01:12:44,811 --> 01:12:45,821
What is it?

2142
01:12:46,340 --> 01:12:47,849
What is it?

2143
01:12:47,850 --> 01:12:50,480
(Inside the box is a cellphone.)

2144
01:12:50,481 --> 01:12:51,491
What is it?

2145
01:12:51,680 --> 01:12:53,095
- Again? - It's a cellphone.

2146
01:12:53,220 --> 01:12:55,473
- Since we don't have money... - Let it have the same instruction.

2147
01:12:55,951 --> 01:12:56,959
Please let it have the same instruction.

2148
01:12:56,960 --> 01:12:59,589
Please let it have the same instruction.

2149
01:12:59,590 --> 01:13:00,789
(Did they get the same instruction?)

2150
01:13:00,790 --> 01:13:03,060
Team Jae Seok acquired the second cellphone.

2151
01:13:03,061 --> 01:13:04,615
It's the same instruction.

2152
01:13:04,701 --> 01:13:05,873
- Okay. - It's the same instruction.

2153
01:13:06,201 --> 01:13:07,988
- Thank goodness. - Hurry up and pick a box.

2154
01:13:08,031 --> 01:13:09,111
Okay. They are done.

2155
01:13:09,271 --> 01:13:11,499
- It's the same instruction. - It's the same instruction.

2156
01:13:11,500 --> 01:13:12,839
(Did they receive the same instruction?)

2157
01:13:12,840 --> 01:13:14,310
- It's the same instruction. - It's the same instruction.

2158
01:13:14,311 --> 01:13:16,509
(Are they acting after receiving the different instruction?)

2159
01:13:16,510 --> 01:13:17,996
They are acting.

2160
01:13:18,241 --> 01:13:20,450
Hold on, hold on.

2161
01:13:20,451 --> 01:13:22,480
Do they need to remove someone's name tag?

2162
01:13:22,481 --> 01:13:23,919
- Be careful. - It might be like that.

2163
01:13:23,920 --> 01:13:25,698
Be careful, everyone.

2164
01:13:26,481 --> 01:13:28,713
- Be careful, everyone. - This is hard.

2165
01:13:29,151 --> 01:13:30,907
Maybe it's their mission to remove Jong Kook's name tag.

2166
01:13:32,460 --> 01:13:35,889
We will start the bid for this box at a dollar.

2167
01:13:35,890 --> 01:13:36,929
20 dollars.

2168
01:13:36,930 --> 01:13:38,099
Team Seok Jin bid 20 dollars.

2169
01:13:38,100 --> 01:13:39,360
- 50 dollars. - 50 dollars.

2170
01:13:39,361 --> 01:13:41,219
- We bid 70 dollars. - 70 dollars.

2171
01:13:41,401 --> 01:13:42,583
- 80 dollars. - 90 dollars.

2172
01:13:42,901 --> 01:13:44,669
120 dollars. 120 dollars.

2173
01:13:44,670 --> 01:13:45,799
So Min bid 120 dollars.

2174
01:13:45,800 --> 01:13:47,286
Team Jae Seok, will you not place a bid?

2175
01:13:47,640 --> 01:13:48,810
- The highest bid is 120 dollars. - How much is it?

2176
01:13:48,811 --> 01:13:50,179
- 120 dollars. - It's too expensive.

2177
01:13:50,180 --> 01:13:51,179
120 dollars.

2178
01:13:51,180 --> 01:13:53,480
- We are not the type to overspend. - 120 dollars.

2179
01:13:53,481 --> 01:13:55,097
You have the most amount of money.

2180
01:13:55,210 --> 01:13:56,950
1, 2, 3.

2181
01:13:56,951 --> 01:13:58,450
- 150 dollars. - 150 dollars.

2182
01:13:58,451 --> 01:14:00,369
- 160 dollars? - 160 dollars.

2183
01:14:01,290 --> 01:14:02,650
- What? What is going on? - Stop him.

2184
01:14:02,651 --> 01:14:03,671
I think he is doing something.

2185
01:14:04,361 --> 01:14:06,389
(Kwang Soo suddenly gets up.)

2186
01:14:06,390 --> 01:14:08,814
(Jae Seok touches the sole of Kwang Soo's foot.)

2187
01:14:09,390 --> 01:14:11,249
The winners of this race are...

2188
01:14:11,960 --> 01:14:13,429
- Yu Jae Seok and Lee Kwang Soo. - Why?

2189
01:14:13,430 --> 01:14:15,629
(When their feet touched, the race ended.)

2190
01:14:15,630 --> 01:14:17,039
Yu Jae Seok and Lee Kwang Soo.

2191
01:14:17,040 --> 01:14:19,169
(Are Yu Jae Seok and Lee Kwang Soo the winners of this race?)

2192
01:14:19,170 --> 01:14:20,169
- Why? - What are you talking about?

2193
01:14:20,170 --> 01:14:21,509
(Why are they the winners?)

2194
01:14:21,510 --> 01:14:23,055
- What did they do? - Their feet...

2195
01:14:23,111 --> 01:14:24,339
Their feet touched.

2196
01:14:24,340 --> 01:14:25,339
The final mission was...

2197
01:14:25,340 --> 01:14:26,810
(The final mission was...)

2198
01:14:26,811 --> 01:14:28,379
What? Hold on.

2199
01:14:28,380 --> 01:14:30,719
(They received instruction through the first auction.)

2200
01:14:30,720 --> 01:14:33,044
(The sole of your left foot)

2201
01:14:33,590 --> 01:14:36,751
(Then they acquired a cellphone through the 8th auction.)

2202
01:14:37,491 --> 01:14:39,160
(Inside it...)

2203
01:14:39,161 --> 01:14:42,330
(was another instruction.)

2204
01:14:42,331 --> 01:14:43,412
(And the sole of another member's foot must clap.)

2205
01:14:43,630 --> 01:14:44,629
(The sole of your left foot...)

2206
01:14:44,630 --> 01:14:46,176
(and the sole of another member's foot must clap.)

2207
01:14:47,371 --> 01:14:48,629
It's the same instruction.

2208
01:14:48,630 --> 01:14:50,240
(To carry out the mission secretly,)

2209
01:14:50,241 --> 01:14:52,928
(they put on an act.)

2210
01:14:53,071 --> 01:14:55,339
(While the other members were focused on the auction)

2211
01:14:55,340 --> 01:14:57,679
(Clap)

2212
01:14:57,680 --> 01:15:00,337
(They succeeded to clap their feet.)

2213
01:15:01,811 --> 01:15:04,508
I was stopping Kwang Soo.

2214
01:15:04,680 --> 01:15:05,690
Is the race over?

2215
01:15:06,350 --> 01:15:07,990
Here is the prize of the day.

2216
01:15:07,991 --> 01:15:09,020
- What is it? - The prize.

2217
01:15:09,021 --> 01:15:12,160
Choose a box each from the remaining boxes.

2218
01:15:12,161 --> 01:15:14,429
We will give you what's inside the box.

2219
01:15:14,430 --> 01:15:16,030
(There are 41 remaining boxes.)

2220
01:15:16,031 --> 01:15:17,160
Even if there is a cellphone inside, will you give it to them?

2221
01:15:17,161 --> 01:15:18,259
Even if there is a cellphone inside,

2222
01:15:18,260 --> 01:15:19,499
- we will give it to them. - Really?

2223
01:15:19,500 --> 01:15:21,318
- That's incredible. - You must be happy.

2224
01:15:21,571 --> 01:15:23,299
- Really? - You must be happy.

2225
01:15:23,300 --> 01:15:24,299
That's incredible.

2226
01:15:24,300 --> 01:15:26,240
- I choose... - I am so jealous.

2227
01:15:26,241 --> 01:15:27,887
I choose the biggest box.

2228
01:15:28,071 --> 01:15:29,070
Okay.

2229
01:15:29,071 --> 01:15:31,333
How about the one on the bottom?

2230
01:15:31,380 --> 01:15:33,980
- Jae Seok is lucky these days. - He is lucky.

2231
01:15:33,981 --> 01:15:35,899
He chose a cellphone first.

2232
01:15:35,911 --> 01:15:37,320
- Right. - Seriously.

2233
01:15:37,321 --> 01:15:38,664
- That one. - This one?

2234
01:15:39,281 --> 01:15:40,990
(The lucky Jae Seok chooses a box after much deliberation.)

2235
01:15:40,991 --> 01:15:42,001
It's a small box.

2236
01:15:42,151 --> 01:15:43,959
(Will the box contain a cellphone?)

2237
01:15:43,960 --> 01:15:45,032
You never know.

2238
01:15:46,021 --> 01:15:48,060
Let's unbox in turns. Kwang Soo should go first.

2239
01:15:48,061 --> 01:15:49,360
(Kwang Soo unboxes first.)

2240
01:15:49,361 --> 01:15:50,799
- I am jealous. - I wonder what's inside.

2241
01:15:50,800 --> 01:15:52,517
- All right. - This is fun.

2242
01:15:52,561 --> 01:15:53,914
You will give them what's inside the box.

2243
01:15:54,130 --> 01:15:55,242
We will give them the entire thing.

2244
01:15:55,670 --> 01:15:58,629
(Will there be a cellphone inside?)

2245
01:15:58,941 --> 01:16:00,310
(He opens the box.)

2246
01:16:00,311 --> 01:16:01,570
There could be a person inside.

2247
01:16:01,571 --> 01:16:03,070
- There is nothing. - It's an empty box.

2248
01:16:03,071 --> 01:16:06,240
(Empty)

2249
01:16:06,241 --> 01:16:07,580
Take the box.

2250
01:16:07,581 --> 01:16:09,772
(They give him the entire thing.)

2251
01:16:10,220 --> 01:16:11,950
(Kwang Soo wins a huge box for a prize.)

2252
01:16:11,951 --> 01:16:14,419
- It's empty. - It could replace...

2253
01:16:14,420 --> 01:16:15,461
your cut-out that we exchanged.

2254
01:16:15,590 --> 01:16:17,408
Go inside the box to imitate the cut-out.

2255
01:16:17,821 --> 01:16:19,219
Go inside the box to imitate it.

2256
01:16:19,220 --> 01:16:20,644
(For goodness' sake.)

2257
01:16:20,890 --> 01:16:22,589
- Jae Seok. - All right.

2258
01:16:22,590 --> 01:16:24,160
I bet Jae Seok's box has something.

2259
01:16:24,161 --> 01:16:25,330
Jae Seok is lucky these days.

2260
01:16:25,331 --> 01:16:27,599
- I should win a prize... - That's right.

2261
01:16:27,600 --> 01:16:29,145
- if I am lucky. - That's right.

2262
01:16:29,800 --> 01:16:33,275
(There is a mission card inside the box.)

2263
01:16:34,571 --> 01:16:35,610
This is good.

2264
01:16:35,611 --> 01:16:37,701
- There must be a cellphone. - He is insane.

2265
01:16:38,441 --> 01:16:42,679
(Will he discard his old image and win a cellphone as a prize?)

2266
01:16:42,680 --> 01:16:43,879
It's a jump rope!

2267
01:16:43,880 --> 01:16:46,072
(A cellphone, my foot.)

2268
01:16:47,590 --> 01:16:49,150
It's a jump rope.

2269
01:16:49,151 --> 01:16:50,676
Jae Seok.

2270
01:16:51,220 --> 01:16:53,259
He is reverting back to his old self.

2271
01:16:53,260 --> 01:16:54,675
He is unlucky.

2272
01:16:54,930 --> 01:16:56,072
That was incredible.

2273
01:16:56,531 --> 01:16:58,015
That's Jae Seok.

2274
01:17:00,061 --> 01:17:01,748
(The door opens,)

2275
01:17:02,470 --> 01:17:05,530
(and a shocking sight unfolds before them.)

2276
01:17:06,470 --> 01:17:07,539
- Is it a room escape? - It's room escape game.

2277
01:17:07,540 --> 01:17:11,378
(Staff member A died in a mysterious way.)

2278
01:17:11,640 --> 01:17:12,679
Nobody move!

2279
01:17:12,680 --> 01:17:14,410
(The door gets locked again.)

2280
01:17:14,411 --> 01:17:16,879
(Is it a trap by the culprit?)

2281
01:17:16,880 --> 01:17:19,280
(Traces of the crime are scattered everywhere.)

2282
01:17:19,281 --> 01:17:21,371
(Find the clues and figure out the cause of death.)

2283
01:17:21,750 --> 01:17:24,750
(Search for the culprit begins in earnest.)

2284
01:17:24,960 --> 01:17:27,360
(The whole story gets revealed.)

2285
01:17:27,361 --> 01:17:29,351
(Who could be the culprit?)

2286
01:17:29,760 --> 01:17:30,759
(Case Number 444)

2287
01:17:30,760 --> 01:17:32,952
(The Invisible Danger)
