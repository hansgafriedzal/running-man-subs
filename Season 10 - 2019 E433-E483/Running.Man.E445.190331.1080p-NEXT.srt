00:00:06,645 --> 00:00:09,164
- Hello. - Hello.

2
00:00:09,184 --> 00:00:10,684
- Hello. - Are you working out these days?

3
00:00:10,685 --> 00:00:11,813
- Yes, I'm working out. - You are?

4
00:00:11,814 --> 00:00:13,783
- Look at your arms. - Of course.

5
00:00:13,784 --> 00:00:15,983
- Your biceps are getting big. - They are firm.

6
00:00:15,984 --> 00:00:17,593
- What's gotten into you? - I'm working out these days.

7
00:00:17,594 --> 00:00:18,675
He's looking to get younger.

8
00:00:18,754 --> 00:00:20,423
Look at this. Feel this part.

9
00:00:20,424 --> 00:00:22,763
I don't know about his chest, but his arms impressed me.

10
00:00:22,764 --> 00:00:24,763
But what's wrong with your legs?

11
00:00:24,764 --> 00:00:25,958
(But what's wrong with your legs?)

12
00:00:26,804 --> 00:00:28,164
- What happened to your legs? - I couldn't improve my leg muscles.

13
00:00:28,165 --> 00:00:30,803
Ji Hyo. Hey, isn't Ji Hyo's outfit today great?

14
00:00:30,804 --> 00:00:32,134
- You look cute. - When I said she looked good,

15
00:00:32,135 --> 00:00:33,873
- she said I was teasing her. - If there is a spy among us,

16
00:00:33,874 --> 00:00:34,925
it has to be her.

17
00:00:35,374 --> 00:00:36,713
No.

18
00:00:36,714 --> 00:00:37,974
- Ji Hyo. - She looks like Detective Conan.

19
00:00:37,975 --> 00:00:38,974
Her outfit looks great on her.

20
00:00:38,975 --> 00:00:41,184
She's Detective Conan. Ji Hyo is Detective Conan today.

21
00:00:41,185 --> 00:00:44,053
Everyone, you'd better be careful today.

22
00:00:44,054 --> 00:00:45,354
She's out to get everyone today.

23
00:00:45,355 --> 00:00:48,083
- So Min went to the Czech Republic. - She went to the Czech Republic.

24
00:00:48,084 --> 00:00:49,083
(She went on a trip recently.)

25
00:00:49,084 --> 00:00:51,675
Did you meet any guys in the Czech Republic?

26
00:00:51,795 --> 00:00:53,364
Romance on a trip.

27
00:00:53,365 --> 00:00:54,794
Tell us about Jack.

28
00:00:54,795 --> 00:00:56,133
- Jack? - Jack?

29
00:00:56,134 --> 00:00:57,663
(He suddenly exposes her.)

30
00:00:57,664 --> 00:00:58,763
- You met him at a club. - She met Jack?

31
00:00:58,764 --> 00:01:00,703
Tell us about Jack. You met him at a club.

32
00:01:00,704 --> 00:01:01,703
(Exposing her for the 2nd time)

33
00:01:01,704 --> 00:01:05,604
She went to a popular club in the Czech Republic.

34
00:01:05,605 --> 00:01:08,674
- She met Jack there. - So Min was dancing there.

35
00:01:08,675 --> 00:01:10,684
- A guy approached her. - Okay.

36
00:01:10,875 --> 00:01:14,180
When he spoke English to her, she said, "No English".

37
00:01:14,444 --> 00:01:16,413
When she said that, he used the translation application.

38
00:01:16,414 --> 00:01:17,683
(Using the app on his phone)

39
00:01:17,684 --> 00:01:18,713
- He showed his interest. - It said,

40
00:01:18,714 --> 00:01:20,583
"I like your dancing."

41
00:01:20,584 --> 00:01:23,145
(He uses the translation app after he approves of her dance.)

42
00:01:23,395 --> 00:01:24,693
- He liked this? - Did you dance like this?

43
00:01:24,694 --> 00:01:25,693
This?

44
00:01:25,694 --> 00:01:28,064
(Did you dance like this?)

45
00:01:28,065 --> 00:01:29,163
(Possible dance routines of So Min)

46
00:01:29,164 --> 00:01:30,364
She could have done this.

47
00:01:30,365 --> 00:01:32,293
(Shaking Her Bottom Dance)

48
00:01:32,294 --> 00:01:33,333
(Madonna's Shake-it Dance)

49
00:01:33,334 --> 00:01:34,404
Was it this?

50
00:01:34,405 --> 00:01:35,864
(Madonna's Shake-it Dance)

51
00:01:35,865 --> 00:01:37,433
Didn't she do this dance?

52
00:01:37,434 --> 00:01:42,073
(Twisting Her Pelvis Dance)

53
00:01:42,074 --> 00:01:43,174
(She ruled the clubs in the Czech Republic.)

54
00:01:43,175 --> 00:01:45,999
So this is what she said about the meeting.

55
00:01:46,684 --> 00:01:49,541
Under the colorful lights with loud music,

56
00:01:49,655 --> 00:01:51,858
there were only Jack and her.

57
00:01:51,884 --> 00:01:52,954
- Like in the movie "La Boum". - My gosh.

58
00:01:52,955 --> 00:01:54,892
- Right. It was like "La Boum". - Yes.

59
00:01:55,054 --> 00:01:57,394
(It was the moment Jack used the translation app.)

60
00:01:57,395 --> 00:01:59,394
He's like Jack from the movie, "Titanic".

61
00:01:59,395 --> 00:02:01,594
- That's how she described it. - Right.

62
00:02:01,595 --> 00:02:04,034
She went to a zoo the next day.

63
00:02:04,035 --> 00:02:05,234
- Did they meet again? - They ran into each other.

64
00:02:05,235 --> 00:02:07,064
- My gosh. - When you travel,

65
00:02:07,065 --> 00:02:08,564
- that happens. - Is that true? Did she get drunk?

66
00:02:08,565 --> 00:02:09,974
- Is that a lie? Was she drunk? - The itineraries are similar.

67
00:02:09,975 --> 00:02:12,034
No, no. We really met. The otter...

68
00:02:12,035 --> 00:02:15,173
I was looking at otters and thought that they were cute.

69
00:02:15,174 --> 00:02:17,513
It was a bright afternoon.

70
00:02:17,514 --> 00:02:19,274
When I was looking at the otters, I felt something weird.

71
00:02:19,275 --> 00:02:21,244
- That's your point of view. - The wind was blowing.

72
00:02:21,245 --> 00:02:25,294
When the wind was fluttering my hair romantically like this,

73
00:02:25,454 --> 00:02:26,983
- someone next to me said, - That was romantic.

74
00:02:26,984 --> 00:02:28,107
"Hey".

75
00:02:28,685 --> 00:02:30,524
(Laughing)

76
00:02:30,525 --> 00:02:31,678
Someone next to me said, "Hey".

77
00:02:32,794 --> 00:02:37,384
("Who is it? Is it you, Jack?")

78
00:02:37,864 --> 00:02:39,434
And I looked at him.

79
00:02:39,435 --> 00:02:42,304
- No one turns around like that. - "Hey!"

80
00:02:42,305 --> 00:02:43,804
(Starring So Min and Jack)

81
00:02:44,104 --> 00:02:46,274
When I looked at him, he said, "In the club".

82
00:02:46,275 --> 00:02:48,603
- He saw you at the club. - "Jack!" My gosh!

83
00:02:48,604 --> 00:02:50,774
(That's how So Min and Jack encountered again.)

84
00:02:50,775 --> 00:02:51,814
It's funny.

85
00:02:51,815 --> 00:02:52,883
(What's the ending of her romance in the Czech Republic?)

86
00:02:52,884 --> 00:02:54,714
So what happened? You have to tell us what happened.

87
00:02:54,715 --> 00:02:56,554
We exchanged email addresses.

88
00:02:56,555 --> 00:02:57,684
- Emails? - I got his email.

89
00:02:57,685 --> 00:03:00,823
We don't know what's going to happen with this.

90
00:03:00,824 --> 00:03:02,559
Can't we invite him as a guest?

91
00:03:02,685 --> 00:03:04,494
- Let's do that. It'd be awesome. - Sure.

92
00:03:04,495 --> 00:03:06,124
- I will share any news... - Great.

93
00:03:06,125 --> 00:03:08,663

- Secret Couple? - Yes.

(Secret Couple Amid the Battle of Singles )

100
00:03:20,275 --> 00:03:22,474
(If you say there is a secret couple,)

101
00:03:22,475 --> 00:03:24,274
(it has to be you, Lovesick Giraffe!)

102
00:03:24,275 --> 00:03:26,896
Why is that me all of a sudden? Why me all of a sudden?

103
00:03:27,085 --> 00:03:28,314
- Why is it me? - I got him.

104
00:03:28,315 --> 00:03:29,584
- It could be him. - Listen.

105
00:03:29,585 --> 00:03:31,314
- No, no. - He actually did it.

106
00:03:31,315 --> 00:03:33,254
- It's him. - He did keep it a secret.

107
00:03:33,255 --> 00:03:35,584
- How is that related to this? - You're acting funny.

108
00:03:35,585 --> 00:03:37,094
Kwang Soo is known for secret relationships.

109
00:03:37,095 --> 00:03:38,793
- "Secret couple?" - Look at him.

110
00:03:38,794 --> 00:03:40,594
- No, no. - I caught him.

111
00:03:40,595 --> 00:03:42,524
- I was surprised to hear that. - I got him.

112
00:03:42,525 --> 00:03:44,363
Hold on. You...

113
00:03:44,364 --> 00:03:46,404
- No, no. - Someone better not wear that hat.

114
00:03:46,405 --> 00:03:48,934
- No, no. - Someone better not wear that hat.

115
00:03:48,935 --> 00:03:50,774
- This hat... - It's so obvious.

116
00:03:50,775 --> 00:03:51,934
There has to be a theme for her outfit.

117
00:03:51,935 --> 00:03:53,543
- No one can wear a leather jacket. - No, no.

118
00:03:53,544 --> 00:03:54,573
- It's not me. - It's not?

119
00:03:54,574 --> 00:03:56,003
It's really not me.

120
00:03:56,174 --> 00:03:57,613
If someone wears a similar hat, it'd be so funny.

121
00:03:57,614 --> 00:04:01,043
Everyone, you are all single members.

122

- I... - He's not.

125
00:04:06,625 --> 00:04:08,929
- Did you see him screaming in joy? - It came out before I could stop.

126
00:04:10,625 --> 00:04:12,754
- It was that word, "single". - Everyone was quiet, but him.

There aren't that many doors.

(Three new single members will join the Battle of Singles.)

132

- It's been ages, Hee Jin. - It's been so long.

149
00:04:57,374 --> 00:04:58,673
- Yes, it's been a while. - Exactly.

150
00:04:58,674 --> 00:05:00,704
- After "X-Man"... - "X-Man".

151
00:05:00,705 --> 00:05:02,378
- "Of course". - She was popular during that era.

152

154
00:05:05,544 --> 00:05:07,248
- I haven't seen her after "X-Man". - "X-Man".

155
00:05:07,885 --> 00:05:09,584
- She hasn't changed. - People don't know that show now.

156
00:05:09,585 --> 00:05:10,884
What are you talking about? They all know that show.

157
00:05:10,885 --> 00:05:12,454
- I grew up watching "X-Man". - Really?

158
00:05:12,455 --> 00:05:13,553
- I saw you on the show. - Of course.

159
00:05:13,554 --> 00:05:16,053
- I grew up watching the show. - Her love interest was Jong Min.

160
00:05:16,054 --> 00:05:17,194
- That's right. - Really?

161
00:05:17,195 --> 00:05:19,553
- How did you know that? - I remember everything.

162
00:05:19,554 --> 00:05:21,224
- Really? - It was Jong Min?

163
00:05:21,225 --> 00:05:22,958
- Really? - I can remember everything.

164
00:05:24,164 --> 00:05:28,134
(In 2005, Young Hee Jin was a newbie on variety shows.)

165

- This is what he said to me. - What did he say?

169
00:05:36,674 --> 00:05:38,714
He said that he really liked Hee Jin.

170
00:05:39,244 --> 00:05:40,784
- He said he liked me? - He really liked you.

171
00:05:40,785 --> 00:05:43,784
I can't believe Hee Jin is joining us today.

172
00:05:43,785 --> 00:05:46,053
- It's so nice to see you again. - Same here.

173
00:05:46,054 --> 00:05:48,683
I saw you on telly too.

174
00:05:48,684 --> 00:05:50,993
- It's so nice to hear "telly". - What a charming word!

175
00:05:50,994 --> 00:05:52,654
- So nice to see you again! - "Telly"?

176
00:05:52,655 --> 00:05:54,224
- "Telly". She's an oldie. - I'm so glad to see her.

177
00:05:54,225 --> 00:05:55,293
(They're happy to see another oldie.)

178
00:05:55,294 --> 00:05:56,663
- She's an oldie. - She saw us on telly.

179
00:05:56,664 --> 00:05:58,964
- She used that word like a pro. - That's so nice to hear that.

180
00:05:58,965 --> 00:06:01,034
Not that many people use that word anymore.

181
00:06:01,035 --> 00:06:03,303
- It's so nice to see her again. - All right. Hee Jin is joining us.

182
00:06:03,304 --> 00:06:06,574
We'll bring in the next guest. Please come on out.

183
00:06:06,575 --> 00:06:08,344
(Who is the next new single member?)

184
00:06:08,345 --> 00:06:11,613
(They're looking forward to the second guest. Who is it?)

185
00:06:11,614 --> 00:06:12,940
Hello.

186
00:06:12,945 --> 00:06:14,613
- My gosh. - Bona!

187
00:06:14,614 --> 00:06:17,103
(A multitalented single, Bona of WJSN)

188
00:06:17,715 --> 00:06:20,284
(This lead dancer of WJSN is a talented idol singer.)

189
00:06:20,285 --> 00:06:23,553
(She dominated variety shows by starring on "The Law of Jungle".)

190
00:06:23,554 --> 00:06:26,793
(Bona is a versatile single member with many talents.)

191
00:06:26,794 --> 00:06:28,563
- Come here, Bona. - Bona.

192
00:06:28,564 --> 00:06:29,964
- Hello. - Hello.

193
00:06:29,965 --> 00:06:31,433
(Hi, Bona. Nice to see you again.)

194
00:06:31,434 --> 00:06:32,689
- Hello, Bona. - I can't believe I'm meeting Bona.

195
00:06:33,164 --> 00:06:34,531
Right.

196
00:06:34,765 --> 00:06:36,134
She and I went to the jungle.

197
00:06:36,135 --> 00:06:37,404
- Really? - You went to the jungle together?

198
00:06:37,405 --> 00:06:39,474
When you star on that show, you become such good friends.

199
00:06:39,475 --> 00:06:40,543
- Right. - Exactly.

200
00:06:40,544 --> 00:06:42,243
- I kept it a secret from you. - Why?

201
00:06:42,244 --> 00:06:43,344
I didn't tell you I was coming here today.

202
00:06:43,345 --> 00:06:44,373
Do you guys keep in touch?

203
00:06:44,374 --> 00:06:46,077
- There's a group chatroom. - There's a group chatroom.

204
00:06:46,414 --> 00:06:49,243
(Things are going well for you!)

205
00:06:49,244 --> 00:06:52,784
(Look at them. They're keeping in touch!)

206
00:06:53,554 --> 00:06:54,584
It's for "The Law of Jungle".

207
00:06:54,585 --> 00:06:56,154
Are you two the secret couple?

208
00:06:56,155 --> 00:06:58,062
- No, no. Never. - My gosh.

209
00:06:58,554 --> 00:07:00,224
- I can see his gums when he smiles. - I don't know.

210
00:07:00,225 --> 00:07:01,764
- He's smiling so broadly. - He's really blushing.

211
00:07:01,765 --> 00:07:03,663
- I hate things like this. - Why is your face getting red?

212
00:07:03,664 --> 00:07:05,878
- His gums doubled today. - Hey.

213
00:07:06,434 --> 00:07:07,764
- Why is your smile so big? - Why is it so big?

214
00:07:07,765 --> 00:07:08,933
- What? - Why is it so big?

215
00:07:08,934 --> 00:07:10,074
I guess my gums are growing.

216
00:07:10,075 --> 00:07:11,942
- Did you put on fake gums? - No.

217
00:07:12,335 --> 00:07:14,173
- Next guest. - Who's the next guest?

218
00:07:14,174 --> 00:07:16,514
(The last single member will be revealed.)

219
00:07:16,515 --> 00:07:20,563
(Who is the last single member that will follow after the ladies?)

220
00:07:21,145 --> 00:07:22,144
- I saw him... - My gosh.

221
00:07:22,145 --> 00:07:23,983
Seriously? He's too handsome.

222
00:07:23,984 --> 00:07:26,943
(Out-of-the-world handsome single guy, Kim Jae Young)

223
00:07:27,554 --> 00:07:28,584
(He's a top model...)

224
00:07:28,585 --> 00:07:30,194
(who's out of everyone's league with awesome walks and face.)

225
00:07:30,195 --> 00:07:32,954
(He gave off irresistible charms in "100 Days My Prince".)

226
00:07:32,955 --> 00:07:35,718
(He's a new movie star on the rise with "Golden Slumber" and "Money".)

227
00:07:35,965 --> 00:07:38,586
Let me introduce Kim Jae Young to you.

228
00:07:38,794 --> 00:07:40,538
- Come here. - He's so handsome.

229
00:07:40,664 --> 00:07:42,563
- This is my first time meeting him. - Right.

230
00:07:42,564 --> 00:07:44,933
- He's very handsome. - No, no.

231
00:07:44,934 --> 00:07:47,322
He looks like a hybrid of Yun Kyun Sang and Na Yoon Kwon.

232
00:07:48,004 --> 00:07:49,574
(Jae Young is a mix of these two men?)

233
00:07:49,575 --> 00:07:51,513
- Na Yoon Kwon? - You're right.

234
00:07:51,715 --> 00:07:52,714
Yes, he does resemble them.

235
00:07:52,715 --> 00:07:54,519
So Min is taking a step forward again.

236
00:07:55,244 --> 00:07:58,620
(She takes a step forward without realizing herself.)

237
00:07:58,814 --> 00:07:59,978
Go back to your spot.

238
00:08:00,085 --> 00:08:02,524
My gosh, So Min. You're unbelievable.

239
00:08:02,525 --> 00:08:05,423
Originally, you debuted as a model, right?

240
00:08:05,424 --> 00:08:06,863
- Yes, I started as a model. - Right.

241
00:08:06,864 --> 00:08:07,993
- He does look like a model. - He does.

242
00:08:07,994 --> 00:08:09,793
One of our comedians used to be...

243
00:08:09,794 --> 00:08:11,233
- a model too. - I see.

244
00:08:11,234 --> 00:08:13,094
(One of our comedians used to be a model too.)

245
00:08:13,095 --> 00:08:14,461
- Comedian? - What are you saying?

246
00:08:15,064 --> 00:08:16,942
- He was a model. - I'm not a comedian.

247
00:08:17,135 --> 00:08:18,274
You're my junior comedian.

248
00:08:18,275 --> 00:08:20,416
You're my and Seok Jin's junior comedian.

249
00:08:20,575 --> 00:08:21,774
Was it something like this?

250
00:08:21,775 --> 00:08:24,774
You know, for some projects, they only use the models' bodies.

251
00:08:24,775 --> 00:08:25,774
Was that what you did?

252
00:08:25,775 --> 00:08:27,621
Have you ever been on a runway?

253
00:08:27,684 --> 00:08:28,944
What have I done wrong?

254
00:08:28,945 --> 00:08:30,553
(He explodes with disappointment.)

255
00:08:30,554 --> 00:08:31,784
Have you been on one?

256
00:08:31,785 --> 00:08:33,483
- Of course, I have. - Really?

257
00:08:33,484 --> 00:08:34,654
Do it. Do the walk.

258
00:08:34,655 --> 00:08:36,353
- Do the walk. - You can't, can you?

259
00:08:36,354 --> 00:08:38,262
(Acting immature)

260
00:08:38,354 --> 00:08:40,523
- Do the walk. - Go do the walk. Do the walk.

261
00:08:40,524 --> 00:08:42,493
(Do you think I'll let you provoke me like a kid?)

262
00:08:42,494 --> 00:08:44,294
(Yes, he will fall for it.)

263
00:08:44,295 --> 00:08:45,763
Go do the walk. Do the walk.

264
00:08:45,935 --> 00:08:50,304
(I'm a top model of Asia with 13 years of experience.)

265
00:08:50,305 --> 00:08:51,773
(I'm Lee Kwang Soo.)

266
00:08:51,774 --> 00:08:52,804
- Kwang Soo. - Do it.

267
00:08:52,805 --> 00:08:54,474
- See? What is this? - Do the walk.

268
00:08:54,475 --> 00:08:57,143
(Is the top model doing a funny pose for the variety show?)

269
00:08:57,144 --> 00:08:58,674
- See? What is this? - Do the walk.

270
00:08:58,675 --> 00:08:59,765
Do the walk.

271
00:09:00,685 --> 00:09:02,928
- Do the model walk. - Do the model walk.

272
00:09:03,045 --> 00:09:04,554
- Walk. - Walk.

273
00:09:04,555 --> 00:09:07,653
(This is the funny walk for variety shows.)

274
00:09:07,654 --> 00:09:10,294
(I'll show you my 10-year experience on Running Man.)

275
00:09:10,295 --> 00:09:11,393
- What was that? - My gosh.

276
00:09:11,394 --> 00:09:12,824
- Do the walk. - Did you see that?

277
00:09:12,825 --> 00:09:14,694
(This comes from his 10 years of experience.)

278
00:09:14,695 --> 00:09:16,704
This is upsetting. It's so upsetting.

279
00:09:17,435 --> 00:09:18,863
- Jae Young. - Yes.

280
00:09:18,965 --> 00:09:21,617
Did you hear any stories about Kwang Soo from your model friends?

281
00:09:22,404 --> 00:09:24,853
He started way before I started.

282
00:09:25,274 --> 00:09:26,643
I didn't get to hear his stories.

283
00:09:26,644 --> 00:09:30,081
(Did the modeling industry forget about this dinosaur model?)

284
00:09:30,244 --> 00:09:32,356
- Models... - He's trying to make me look nice.

285
00:09:32,774 --> 00:09:34,213
- Okay. - He started way before I did.

286
00:09:34,244 --> 00:09:36,444
- He's very polite. - Yes, he does.

287
00:09:36,445 --> 00:09:37,753
Great. All right.

288
00:09:37,754 --> 00:09:40,353
Please tell us how it feels to be on our show today. I'm curious.

289
00:09:40,354 --> 00:09:42,292
First, I'm really nervous.

290
00:09:43,254 --> 00:09:45,194
- He doesn't sound nervous. - Don't be nervous.

291
00:09:45,195 --> 00:09:46,424
His voice sounds the most relaxed.

292
00:09:46,425 --> 00:09:47,794
- Is that so? - You never know.

293
00:09:47,795 --> 00:09:49,893
I will do my best to entertain the viewers.

294
00:09:49,894 --> 00:09:52,164
I'll do my best not to cause any harm.

295
00:09:52,165 --> 00:09:53,834
Okay. He says everything he wants to say.

296
00:09:53,835 --> 00:09:55,164
- He quietly says everything. - He doesn't hold back.

297
00:09:55,165 --> 00:09:56,388
Great.

298
00:09:56,565 --> 00:09:57,974
Let's give a round of applause to Jae Young.

299
00:09:57,975 --> 00:09:59,033
(Every new single member has joined.)

300
00:09:59,034 --> 00:10:00,504
All right. Right now,

301
00:10:00,845 --> 00:10:04,140
there are 11 single members. And among these members,

302
00:10:04,475 --> 00:10:06,555
there is one couple...

303
00:10:06,685 --> 00:10:08,582
- who are dating in secret. - It's just one couple.

304
00:10:08,945 --> 00:10:11,362
And a relationship virgin is hiding amongst you...

305
00:10:11,654 --> 00:10:13,924
to reveal the identities of the secret couple.

306
00:10:13,925 --> 00:10:15,054
- Relationship virgin? - Relationship virgin?

307
00:10:15,055 --> 00:10:17,778
(1 relationship virgin exists to catch the secret couple.)

308
00:10:18,154 --> 00:10:19,653
- There's a relationship virgin. - Who is the relationship virgin?

309
00:10:20,665 --> 00:10:21,763
(Here's the relationship virgin.)

310
00:10:21,764 --> 00:10:23,019
- He's the relationship virgin? - It's him.

311
00:10:23,295 --> 00:10:25,263
- He's the relationship virgin. - I get the feeling that he is.

312
00:10:25,264 --> 00:10:26,834
- Hey. - I get the feeling that he is.

313
00:10:26,835 --> 00:10:28,633
- So Min. - I can feel it right away.

314
00:10:28,634 --> 00:10:29,763
You're unbelievable.

315
00:10:29,764 --> 00:10:31,873
- Jae Seok. - It's him because he's ugly.

316
00:10:31,874 --> 00:10:33,503
(Even if he isn't one, he's known as the ugly one.)

317
00:10:33,504 --> 00:10:36,103
The single members must join forces with the relationship virgin...

318
00:10:36,104 --> 00:10:38,624
to catch the secret couple and eliminate them to win.

319
00:10:38,915 --> 00:10:40,169
Then, you'll win a prize.

320
00:10:40,345 --> 00:10:44,714
If the secret couple manages to hide their identities to the end...

321
00:10:44,715 --> 00:10:47,029
or find and eliminate the relationship virgin,

322
00:10:47,254 --> 00:10:48,886
the secret couple will win.

323
00:10:49,055 --> 00:10:50,724
Then, they will take the prize.

324
00:10:50,725 --> 00:10:51,893
(If even 1 of them survives, it's their win.)

325
00:10:51,894 --> 00:10:53,424
- It's simple. - Yes, it is.

326
00:10:53,764 --> 00:10:55,458
However, the secret couple...

327
00:10:55,565 --> 00:10:57,233
- must carry out hidden missions... - There are missions.

328
00:10:57,234 --> 00:10:58,662
without your knowledge.

329
00:10:59,565 --> 00:11:02,033
We must watch out for people who disappear.

330
00:11:02,034 --> 00:11:03,903
We should check people who are acting strange too.

331
00:11:03,904 --> 00:11:06,174
My gut feeling tells me that they're wearing matching outfits.

332
00:11:06,175 --> 00:11:07,474
(My gut feeling tells me that they're wearing matching outfits.)

333
00:11:07,475 --> 00:11:08,574
- Those two. - You're right.

334
00:11:08,575 --> 00:11:09,844
You're wearing matching outfits.

335
00:11:09,845 --> 00:11:12,190
- You're right. - It's those two.

336
00:11:12,315 --> 00:11:14,732
It made me wonder if they had a special theme or something.

337
00:11:14,784 --> 00:11:16,914
- We'll go to a restaurant. - Okay, okay.

338
00:11:16,915 --> 00:11:19,668
- You'll do your first mission. - Great, great.

339
00:11:19,784 --> 00:11:22,303
- Okay, let's go. - The three guests...

340
00:11:22,624 --> 00:11:24,554
already acquired top, middle, and low meal cards...

341
00:11:24,555 --> 00:11:27,685
through a preliminary mission in advance.

342
00:11:27,695 --> 00:11:28,724
A preliminary mission?

343
00:11:28,725 --> 00:11:30,334
They acquired top, middle, and low meal cards in advance.

344
00:11:30,335 --> 00:11:31,334
(What preliminary mission?)

345
00:11:31,335 --> 00:11:33,445
- They did a preliminary mission? - What did they do?

346
00:11:34,004 --> 00:11:36,363
We called the three of you before the filming because...

347
00:11:36,364 --> 00:11:37,403
(30 minutes before the opening segment)

348
00:11:37,404 --> 00:11:39,413
This is your first time joining our show.

349
00:11:39,734 --> 00:11:42,192
We called you in because of a special mission we'll give you.

350
00:11:42,575 --> 00:11:44,860
Without revealing your identity,

351
00:11:45,144 --> 00:11:47,153
you must carry out your mission to the members.

352
00:11:47,384 --> 00:11:49,013
Depending on the number of your successes,

353
00:11:49,014 --> 00:11:51,783
the appropriate meal cards for your lunch will be given out.

354
00:11:51,784 --> 00:11:52,954
(She's ready for the mission in disguise.)

355
00:11:52,955 --> 00:11:55,025
Hee Jin distributed the team uniforms...

356
00:11:55,185 --> 00:11:56,653
to you.

357
00:11:56,754 --> 00:11:58,182
- I saw her! - Really?

358
00:11:58,225 --> 00:11:59,347
I remember that!

359
00:11:59,425 --> 00:12:01,523
- I knew it! - I remember that!

360
00:12:01,524 --> 00:12:03,054
- It was when we were in that room! - She was in our room?

361
00:12:03,435 --> 00:12:04,993
You wore a black padded jacket.

362
00:12:04,994 --> 00:12:06,391
(When did Hee Jin carry out her mission?)

363
00:12:07,264 --> 00:12:09,464
- They don't know where I am, right? - Right.

364
00:12:09,465 --> 00:12:10,555
(15 minutes before the filming)

365
00:12:10,975 --> 00:12:12,300
I hope they don't recognize me.

366
00:12:13,404 --> 00:12:17,113
(She enters the waiting room with the team uniforms.)

367
00:12:17,114 --> 00:12:20,044
(Everyone is engrossed in the cellphone game.)

368
00:12:20,045 --> 00:12:24,383
(Hee Jin comes in at a nice timing.)

369
00:12:24,384 --> 00:12:26,153
(But at that moment,)

370
00:12:26,154 --> 00:12:28,924
(did Se Chan see her?)

371
00:12:28,925 --> 00:12:32,594
(Why is he looking at me? Did he already recognize me?)

372
00:12:32,595 --> 00:12:36,164
(Will she be exposed even before her mission?)

373
00:12:36,165 --> 00:12:37,664
I couldn't hide this.

374
00:12:37,665 --> 00:12:38,763
What?

375
00:12:38,764 --> 00:12:41,164
Give this to the first member.

376
00:12:41,165 --> 00:12:42,533
(She starts her mission after averting a crisis.)

377
00:12:42,534 --> 00:12:46,204
(She successfully gives it to Se Chan.)

378
00:12:46,205 --> 00:12:50,914
(With the momentum, she successfully hands it to Jae Seok too.)

379
00:12:50,915 --> 00:12:53,544
(It's 3 in a row. She successfully gives it to Ji Hyo.)

380
00:12:53,545 --> 00:12:55,483
(What?)

381
00:12:55,484 --> 00:12:58,853
(Did Jong Kook see Hee Jin?)

382
00:12:58,854 --> 00:13:01,954
(He did see her, but he didn't recognize her.)

383
00:13:01,955 --> 00:13:04,750
(Hee Jin successfully gave the uniforms to everyone.)

384
00:13:04,795 --> 00:13:06,194
- That was amazing. - No way.

385
00:13:06,195 --> 00:13:08,263
- What a surprise! - You were all talking.

386
00:13:08,264 --> 00:13:09,794
I knew it. She was too pretty!

387
00:13:11,364 --> 00:13:12,659
You were wearing a hat and glasses, right?

388
00:13:12,695 --> 00:13:14,564
- That's right. - The thing is that...

389
00:13:14,565 --> 00:13:16,298
- She turned her head too much. - No.

390
00:13:16,364 --> 00:13:18,271
- I looked at her twice. - No.

391
00:13:18,305 --> 00:13:19,356
- No way. - No.

392
00:13:19,435 --> 00:13:20,933
- I had no idea. - Really?

393
00:13:21,675 --> 00:13:22,844
- We kept playing games. - It was...

394
00:13:22,845 --> 00:13:23,865
That weird guy...

395
00:13:23,945 --> 00:13:25,643
who put on the microphone...

396
00:13:25,644 --> 00:13:26,971
Jae Young...

397
00:13:27,585 --> 00:13:29,522
- put microphones on you. - My gosh, it was you.

398
00:13:29,585 --> 00:13:31,954
- You! I knew it. - I knew something felt off.

399
00:13:31,955 --> 00:13:33,821
Something was off. It was off.

400
00:13:33,925 --> 00:13:36,623
(He perfectly transforms into an audio engineer.)

401
00:13:36,624 --> 00:13:37,919
Put on the microphones, please.

402
00:13:38,254 --> 00:13:40,294
(All right! It's time to set out!)

403
00:13:40,295 --> 00:13:42,523
Where? Where should I go?

404
00:13:42,524 --> 00:13:44,964
(He enters the waiting room when everyone is getting ready to film.)

405
00:13:44,965 --> 00:13:46,087
Hello.

406
00:13:46,435 --> 00:13:47,965
- Hello. - Hello.

407
00:13:49,534 --> 00:13:51,733
(Jae Seok stares right at him.)

408
00:13:51,734 --> 00:13:54,044
(But he fails to recognize Jae Young.)

409
00:13:54,045 --> 00:13:57,206
(My gosh, what a relief. Unlike his cool composure, he's nervous.)

410
00:13:58,345 --> 00:13:59,414
I'll put on the microphone.

411
00:13:59,415 --> 00:14:00,608
Okay, the microphone.

412
00:14:01,114 --> 00:14:03,513
(His next target is Seok Jin.)

413
00:14:03,514 --> 00:14:05,684
(After Seok Jin, he successfully puts it on everyone.)

414
00:14:05,685 --> 00:14:07,853
(Again, the members show no attention to him.)

415
00:14:07,854 --> 00:14:10,123
- You! I knew it. - I knew something felt off.

416
00:14:10,124 --> 00:14:13,094
(Just like Hee Jin, he gets the top meal card.)

417
00:14:13,095 --> 00:14:15,993
(That was you? You completely fooled me.)

418
00:14:15,994 --> 00:14:17,834
- I had no idea. - I...

419
00:14:17,835 --> 00:14:20,633
- Earlier, he put it on here. - Right, right.

420
00:14:20,634 --> 00:14:22,094
(It's very far from his mouth.)

421
00:14:23,134 --> 00:14:24,674
- Right, right. - He put it on here.

422
00:14:24,675 --> 00:14:25,704
I put it on you.

423
00:14:25,705 --> 00:14:26,755
Seriously.

424
00:14:27,374 --> 00:14:28,743
- You did, didn't you? - But...

425
00:14:28,744 --> 00:14:30,444
- Right? He put it here. - And I ran away.

426
00:14:30,445 --> 00:14:32,147
That's why I asked him if it should be here.

427
00:14:32,614 --> 00:14:33,767
But he...

428
00:14:33,845 --> 00:14:35,375
- I asked him that. - You did?

429
00:14:36,415 --> 00:14:39,084
(When Jae Young put the microphone on Seok Jin...)

430
00:14:39,085 --> 00:14:40,207
You're putting it here?

431
00:14:41,185 --> 00:14:43,554
(It's his first microphone next to his Adam's apple.)

432
00:14:43,555 --> 00:14:44,724
(This is weird.)

433
00:14:44,725 --> 00:14:46,123
- You're putting it here? - Yes.

434
00:14:46,124 --> 00:14:47,216
(He's flustered inside.)

435
00:14:48,524 --> 00:14:51,553
(Gosh, he almost got me.)

436
00:14:51,565 --> 00:14:52,694
That's why I asked him...

437
00:14:52,695 --> 00:14:54,775
if it should be here. I asked him that.

438
00:14:54,904 --> 00:14:56,503
- I asked him that. - You did?

439
00:14:56,504 --> 00:14:57,574
Yes, I did.

440
00:14:57,575 --> 00:14:58,873
- I asked him if it should be here. - I...

441
00:14:58,874 --> 00:15:00,174
When I asked him that,

442
00:15:00,175 --> 00:15:01,974
- I said yes and went away. - he just walked away.

443
00:15:01,975 --> 00:15:04,055
That's why I thought that...

444
00:15:04,075 --> 00:15:06,214
if I was going to sit here and talk to this side only.

445
00:15:06,215 --> 00:15:09,377
(Will I sit on the right and face right only?)

446
00:15:09,415 --> 00:15:10,613
(His calm composure brought a side effect.)

447
00:15:10,614 --> 00:15:11,814
He put it right here.

448
00:15:11,815 --> 00:15:13,513
Shouldn't you have figured it out then?

449
00:15:13,514 --> 00:15:14,523
But...

450
00:15:14,524 --> 00:15:15,954
You should've recognized him then.

451
00:15:15,955 --> 00:15:17,587
Hey, how could I?

452
00:15:17,654 --> 00:15:20,378
And Bona got autographs...

453
00:15:20,695 --> 00:15:22,194
- from you guys. - Right. I remember that.

454
00:15:22,195 --> 00:15:23,594
- When? - She did that.

455
00:15:23,595 --> 00:15:24,717
Really?

456
00:15:26,095 --> 00:15:30,003
(She transformed into a college student.)

457
00:15:30,004 --> 00:15:31,974
(The first member that showed up was...)

458
00:15:31,975 --> 00:15:34,830
(Ji Hyo with the Detective Conan outfit.)

459
00:15:35,805 --> 00:15:38,214
Ji Hyo, can you give me an autograph?

460
00:15:38,215 --> 00:15:40,743
(Rushing)

461
00:15:40,744 --> 00:15:42,044
- Please move back. - Au autograph, please.

462
00:15:42,045 --> 00:15:45,214
(Ji Hyo looks right at Bona.)

463
00:15:45,215 --> 00:15:46,314
Thank you.

464
00:15:46,315 --> 00:15:48,058
(She manages to get Ji Hyo's autograph.)

465
00:15:48,955 --> 00:15:52,393
(The next target is Seok Jin with his microphone on his neck.)

466
00:15:52,394 --> 00:15:53,454
Thank you.

467
00:15:53,455 --> 00:15:55,564
(She also manages to get an autograph.)

468
00:15:55,565 --> 00:15:57,934
I'm a huge fan. Can I get an autograph?

469
00:15:57,935 --> 00:15:58,955
Sure.

470
00:15:59,034 --> 00:16:00,494
March 1.

471
00:16:00,734 --> 00:16:02,744
- Thank you. - Sure.

472
00:16:03,104 --> 00:16:06,174
(Bona gets 3 autographs from Ji Hyo, Seok Jin, and Jong Kook.)

473
00:16:06,175 --> 00:16:07,844
- That's right! - I went, "An autograph, please."

474
00:16:07,845 --> 00:16:09,435
- I wore glasses. - Really?

475
00:16:09,975 --> 00:16:11,137
Therefore,

476
00:16:11,644 --> 00:16:13,348
Hee Jin and Jae Young...

477
00:16:13,445 --> 00:16:15,045
carried out their missions on all eight of the members.

478
00:16:15,585 --> 00:16:18,113
That's why they acquired the top meal cards.

479
00:16:18,114 --> 00:16:20,883
- She only got three autographs. - Oh, no.

480
00:16:20,884 --> 00:16:22,523
- She acquired a low meal card. - Oh, no.

481
00:16:22,524 --> 00:16:23,993
(Bona acquired a low meal card.)

482
00:16:23,994 --> 00:16:25,994
When you go down to the parking lot,

483
00:16:26,254 --> 00:16:28,664
- you'll see three cars. - Okay.

484
00:16:28,665 --> 00:16:30,980
When you get in the cars first,

485
00:16:31,134 --> 00:16:33,164
the guests will look at the members...

486
00:16:33,165 --> 00:16:35,653
and get in the cars of their choice.

487
00:16:35,764 --> 00:16:36,964
- My gosh. - I see.

488
00:16:36,965 --> 00:16:38,300
They'll see who's in the car?

489
00:16:38,835 --> 00:16:39,998
This is great.

490
00:16:40,504 --> 00:16:42,143
It depends on my decision today.

491
00:16:42,144 --> 00:16:43,950
If Bona gets in...

492
00:16:44,744 --> 00:16:46,714
I just have to avoid getting teamed up with Bona.

493
00:16:46,715 --> 00:16:48,785
(What's the result of the random car draw for teams and meal cards?)

494
00:16:49,685 --> 00:16:50,883
- We can't get in right away? - What is this?

495
00:16:50,884 --> 00:16:52,211
What is it? Do we just get in?

496
00:16:53,014 --> 00:16:54,853
Before you choose, break into 2 teams of 3 members...

497
00:16:54,854 --> 00:16:56,623
- and 1 team of 2 members. - 3, 3, and 2.

498
00:16:56,624 --> 00:16:59,072
- We just need to avoid Bona. - Right.

499
00:16:59,095 --> 00:17:00,594
Why don't we just mix it up?

500
00:17:00,595 --> 00:17:02,064
- Let's play rock-paper-scissors. - Yes, rock-paper-scissors.

501
00:17:02,065 --> 00:17:03,863
- Shall we? - We can do a random draw too.

502
00:17:03,864 --> 00:17:05,033
Let's do that because...

503
00:17:05,034 --> 00:17:07,664
- the couple might try to team up. - Right, right.

504
00:17:07,665 --> 00:17:09,064
- That's right. - Let's do a random draw.

505
00:17:09,065 --> 00:17:10,738
There is only one couple, right?

506
00:17:10,804 --> 00:17:13,558
- What? - It's a guy and a girl, right?

507
00:17:13,905 --> 00:17:15,204
- All right. - I can't tell you that.

508
00:17:15,205 --> 00:17:17,273
- But there could be two couples. - My gosh.

509
00:17:17,274 --> 00:17:20,334
- They could be the same gender. - They could be the same gender.

510
00:17:20,344 --> 00:17:22,426
There must be two couples then.

511
00:17:23,084 --> 00:17:26,753
(It's you, right?)

512
00:17:26,754 --> 00:17:27,877
What?

513
00:17:28,125 --> 00:17:29,354
- What? - What was that?

514
00:17:29,355 --> 00:17:30,793
- Are you picking a fight with me? - Were you flirting with him?

515
00:17:30,794 --> 00:17:32,630
- It's you, isn't it? - What? My gosh.

516
00:17:32,695 --> 00:17:33,847
That's why I did that.

517
00:17:33,994 --> 00:17:35,289
Unbelievable.

518
00:17:35,965 --> 00:17:38,444
(What is that? Is that a hidden mission?)

519
00:17:38,594 --> 00:17:39,993
(The members who pick the same numbers will make teams together.)

520
00:17:39,994 --> 00:17:42,075
- Right. - I see how it's set up.

521
00:17:42,264 --> 00:17:43,464
- Members... - They can choose members.

522
00:17:43,465 --> 00:17:44,874
- All right. - Please.

523
00:17:44,875 --> 00:17:46,604
(It's time to randomly draw for numbers.)

524
00:17:46,605 --> 00:17:47,767
I'm done.

525
00:17:48,274 --> 00:17:49,944
(Good teams have a better chance...)

526
00:17:49,945 --> 00:17:51,644
(of meeting guests with top meal cards.)

527
00:17:51,645 --> 00:17:53,073
Okay. Ji Hyo.

528
00:17:53,074 --> 00:17:55,243
(This is the random draw of spoons their lunch is at stake.)

529
00:17:55,244 --> 00:17:56,438
- All right. Jong Kook. - Okay.

530
00:17:56,484 --> 00:17:57,638
- Okay. - The middle one.

531
00:17:58,284 --> 00:17:59,642
I'll take whatever is left.

532
00:17:59,915 --> 00:18:01,184
I'll take whatever is left.

533
00:18:01,185 --> 00:18:03,061
- I'm not good at random draws. - I see.

534
00:18:03,125 --> 00:18:04,624
I hope Hee Jin chooses my team.

535
00:18:04,625 --> 00:18:05,817
What is it?

536
00:18:06,355 --> 00:18:07,517
- What is it? Hey. - Take the leftover one.

537
00:18:09,395 --> 00:18:10,934
(He puts down the leftovers.)

538
00:18:10,935 --> 00:18:12,033
Hey.

539
00:18:12,034 --> 00:18:14,333
You're so mean.

540
00:18:14,334 --> 00:18:15,934
I know. He needs to move a lot.

541
00:18:15,935 --> 00:18:17,634
- He does. - Yes.

542
00:18:17,635 --> 00:18:19,303
- He needs to move a lot. - Why?

543
00:18:19,304 --> 00:18:21,204
- Number 1 or 2? - Who got number 1?

544
00:18:21,205 --> 00:18:22,503
- Me. - Okay.

545
00:18:22,504 --> 00:18:23,944
- I'm with you. - All right.

546
00:18:23,945 --> 00:18:25,414
- Number one. - It's the comedian team.

547
00:18:25,415 --> 00:18:26,843
- You're right. - Yes.

548
00:18:26,844 --> 00:18:28,782
It's the comedian team.

549
00:18:29,044 --> 00:18:31,023
You guys got number two?

550
00:18:31,284 --> 00:18:33,427
We're the young team. What about you?

551
00:18:33,584 --> 00:18:35,583
(This makes the remaining 2 a team.)

552
00:18:35,584 --> 00:18:38,992
(They're Ji Hyo and Jong Kook.)

553
00:18:39,655 --> 00:18:41,063
I can't believe this!

554
00:18:41,064 --> 00:18:43,464
- It's you two? - What is this?

555
00:18:43,465 --> 00:18:46,364
- Come on. - People will think it's planned.

556
00:18:46,365 --> 00:18:48,577
- Don't do this. - This wasn't planned.

557
00:18:48,605 --> 00:18:51,492
- I don't like this. - They're a couple.

558
00:18:51,804 --> 00:18:54,144
(Are they the secret couple?)

559
00:18:54,145 --> 00:18:55,704
Is this fate?

560
00:18:55,705 --> 00:18:57,214
Let's do our chant.

561
00:18:57,215 --> 00:18:59,914
- Team Comedians! - Team Comedians!

562
00:18:59,915 --> 00:19:00,944
- Team Youth! - Team Youth!

563
00:19:00,945 --> 00:19:02,283
- Team Youth! Let's do it! - Let's do it!

564
00:19:02,284 --> 00:19:03,583
We're Team FC!

565
00:19:03,584 --> 00:19:04,614
What is that?

566
00:19:04,615 --> 00:19:05,954
Future Couple.

567
00:19:05,955 --> 00:19:08,583
(The 3rd team is called Team Future Couple.)

568
00:19:08,584 --> 00:19:10,253
That's great.

569
00:19:10,254 --> 00:19:11,654
- Ji Hyo. - That's nice.

570
00:19:11,655 --> 00:19:13,654
- She confessed her love for him. - She's...

571
00:19:13,655 --> 00:19:15,124
You received a mission, right?

572
00:19:15,125 --> 00:19:16,323
- Team FC! - You did, right?

573
00:19:16,324 --> 00:19:17,833
- No. - I knew it.

574
00:19:17,834 --> 00:19:20,503
How about "Hello, honey"?

575
00:19:20,504 --> 00:19:21,733
That sounds good.

576
00:19:21,734 --> 00:19:23,003
- Hello. - Honey.

577
00:19:23,004 --> 00:19:24,733
(Hello, honey.)

578
00:19:24,734 --> 00:19:26,733
(They decide on their team name.)

579
00:19:26,734 --> 00:19:28,642
He listened to her.

580
00:19:28,945 --> 00:19:30,474
- Shall we go? - Okay.

581
00:19:30,475 --> 00:19:32,243
How could we be divided like this?

582
00:19:32,244 --> 00:19:33,374
It's hilarious.

583
00:19:33,375 --> 00:19:34,644
It's strange.

584
00:19:34,645 --> 00:19:35,743
- It is. - It was just the two of them.

585
00:19:35,744 --> 00:19:37,384
It's always the two of them.

586
00:19:37,385 --> 00:19:40,036
- It's like fate. - How is that possible?

587
00:19:40,754 --> 00:19:42,254
We need to hide.

588
00:19:42,324 --> 00:19:44,027
I think they'll be coming soon.

589
00:19:45,054 --> 00:19:46,724
If Bona gets in, we're done for.

590
00:19:46,725 --> 00:19:47,894
You're right.

591
00:19:47,895 --> 00:19:49,293
She got the low meal card.

592
00:19:49,294 --> 00:19:51,130
I hope they get in one by one.

593
00:19:52,635 --> 00:19:54,093
Hee Jin's here!

594
00:19:54,304 --> 00:19:55,324
Please!

595
00:19:55,834 --> 00:19:57,033
She's here!

596
00:19:57,034 --> 00:19:59,333
(Hee Jin got the top meal card.)

597
00:19:59,334 --> 00:20:01,303
- She's here! - Please.

598
00:20:01,304 --> 00:20:02,743
- She's coming this way. - She is?

599
00:20:02,744 --> 00:20:05,013
- She needs to come here. - You're right.

600
00:20:05,014 --> 00:20:06,371
We need her.

601
00:20:07,685 --> 00:20:08,837
She's here.

602
00:20:10,244 --> 00:20:11,611
It's Hee Jin.

603
00:20:12,355 --> 00:20:14,976
- I wish Jae Young came. - Hee Jin's here.

604
00:20:15,984 --> 00:20:18,504
I want Jae Young. I wish he'd come.

605
00:20:18,554 --> 00:20:20,694
Do I just knock, check, and get in?

606
00:20:20,695 --> 00:20:22,224
You can choose not to.

607
00:20:22,225 --> 00:20:23,934
- You can choose not to. - She's coming this way.

608
00:20:23,935 --> 00:20:25,291
(Someone signals for her to come.)

609
00:20:25,935 --> 00:20:27,404
(Come here.)

610
00:20:27,405 --> 00:20:29,036
Aren't you Haha?

611
00:20:29,205 --> 00:20:31,071
I'm actually glad to see him.

612
00:20:31,804 --> 00:20:33,944
- I'm actually glad to see him. - Hee Jin, get in.

613
00:20:33,945 --> 00:20:35,474
You should get in here.

614
00:20:35,475 --> 00:20:37,374
Don't worry. It's the three of us.

615
00:20:37,375 --> 00:20:39,674
- This is a comfortable team. - We're Team Youth.

616
00:20:39,675 --> 00:20:40,944
- We're Team Youth. - You are.

617
00:20:40,945 --> 00:20:41,983
Team Youth!

618
00:20:41,984 --> 00:20:44,565
- We're... - But I don't like Kwang Soo.

619
00:20:45,185 --> 00:20:46,510
What do you mean?

620
00:20:48,225 --> 00:20:49,449
Thank goodness.

621
00:20:49,885 --> 00:20:51,557
Why are you relieved?

622
00:20:51,695 --> 00:20:53,793
She has the top meal card, so why are you relieved?

623
00:20:53,794 --> 00:20:55,293
(So Min's glad Hee Jin doesn't like Kwang Soo.)

624
00:20:56,395 --> 00:20:58,063
(She moves onto the middle car.)

625
00:20:58,064 --> 00:20:59,833
- Hee Jin. - Hello!

626
00:20:59,834 --> 00:21:01,333
It's nice to meet you.

627
00:21:01,334 --> 00:21:02,833
I'm a big fan of yours.

628
00:21:02,834 --> 00:21:04,634
This is a nice team.

629
00:21:04,635 --> 00:21:06,471
- Hello. - Why don't you hop in?

630
00:21:07,304 --> 00:21:10,404
- Is Jong Kook here? - He's back here.

631
00:21:10,405 --> 00:21:11,741
I'm scared of him.

632
00:21:12,715 --> 00:21:13,843
(She doesn't like Jong Kook.)

633
00:21:13,844 --> 00:21:15,083
She's afraid of me?

634
00:21:15,084 --> 00:21:17,634
- She's afraid of you. - Why would she be?

635
00:21:18,215 --> 00:21:19,785
I'm not a scary person.

636
00:21:20,084 --> 00:21:21,614
Goodness.

637
00:21:21,824 --> 00:21:24,547
Jong Kook is a nice person once you get to know him.

638
00:21:24,895 --> 00:21:29,023
(She arrives at the last car.)

639
00:21:29,024 --> 00:21:30,249
I'll hide.

640
00:21:30,395 --> 00:21:32,063
- Hello! - Hello!

641
00:21:32,064 --> 00:21:33,394
Hello!

642
00:21:33,395 --> 00:21:34,704
Get in!

643
00:21:34,705 --> 00:21:38,580
(In order to persuade her, they act extremely friendly.)

644
00:21:38,834 --> 00:21:40,333
- Hee Jin. - Get in.

645
00:21:40,405 --> 00:21:41,503
- Get in. - Hello.

646
00:21:41,504 --> 00:21:43,674
- This is your chance. - Just hop in.

647
00:21:43,675 --> 00:21:45,974
This is Team Comedians!

648
00:21:45,975 --> 00:21:46,974
(He pressures her.)

649
00:21:46,975 --> 00:21:48,743
Let me think about it.

650
00:21:48,744 --> 00:21:49,914
(Hesitant)

651
00:21:49,915 --> 00:21:51,483
(Their chant must not be too persuasive.)

652
00:21:51,484 --> 00:21:53,729
- Goodness. - I shouldn't have said that.

653
00:21:53,784 --> 00:21:56,624
- Why did you say that? - Why did you say our chant?

654
00:21:56,625 --> 00:21:58,823
- We lost some points. - We're a friendly team.

655
00:21:58,824 --> 00:22:00,222
I've made a mistake.

656
00:22:01,064 --> 00:22:02,563
Where should I go?

657
00:22:02,564 --> 00:22:05,287
(She's not interested in any of them.)

658
00:22:05,935 --> 00:22:07,364
My goodness.

659
00:22:07,365 --> 00:22:09,752
(They cry out for her.)

660
00:22:10,834 --> 00:22:12,434
- She's coming! - She's coming!

661
00:22:12,435 --> 00:22:14,382
- She's getting in! - She's getting in!

662
00:22:15,274 --> 00:22:17,589
(She tries to open the door.)

663
00:22:18,774 --> 00:22:21,083
(Why isn't it opening?)

664
00:22:21,084 --> 00:22:22,614
(She won't get in that easily.)

665
00:22:22,615 --> 00:22:24,317
- Get out! - What are you doing?

666
00:22:24,885 --> 00:22:26,753
(So Min locks the door.)

667
00:22:26,754 --> 00:22:28,424
(What are you doing?)

668
00:22:28,425 --> 00:22:29,955
Open the door! Hurry up!

669
00:22:30,024 --> 00:22:31,154
What's wrong with you?

670
00:22:31,155 --> 00:22:32,481
- Get in! - What's your problem?

671
00:22:32,695 --> 00:22:34,124
(Kwang Soo stops her.)

672
00:22:34,125 --> 00:22:35,552
What's gotten into her?

673
00:22:35,794 --> 00:22:37,964
(What's going on? I should leave.)

674
00:22:37,965 --> 00:22:39,063
I should go.

675
00:22:39,064 --> 00:22:40,634
- Hee Jin! - No, thanks.

676
00:22:40,635 --> 00:22:42,364
- Hee Jin! - Hee Jin!

677
00:22:42,365 --> 00:22:44,752
- No, thanks. - We want you!

678
00:22:45,475 --> 00:22:47,789
(They peek from the top.)

679
00:22:48,445 --> 00:22:50,743
- What are you hesitant about? - What is it?

680
00:22:50,744 --> 00:22:53,214
No, you can't get in.

681
00:22:53,215 --> 00:22:55,384
- I can't? - You should join us.

682
00:22:55,385 --> 00:22:56,684
Hee Jin!

683
00:22:56,685 --> 00:22:58,215
- Hee Jin! - Hee Jin!

684
00:22:58,314 --> 00:23:00,283
- Hee Jin! - Smile!

685
00:23:00,284 --> 00:23:02,483
- Smile, smile, smile. - Leave them.

686
00:23:02,484 --> 00:23:04,553
(They change their chant.)

687
00:23:04,554 --> 00:23:05,922
- I'm going to go to that team. - Leave them.

688
00:23:06,125 --> 00:23:07,464
- Where are you going? - Hey!

689
00:23:07,465 --> 00:23:08,793
Listen to me!

690
00:23:08,794 --> 00:23:10,864
- Hear me out! - Hee Jin, it's this way!

691
00:23:10,865 --> 00:23:12,533
- Hey! - Listen to me.

692
00:23:12,534 --> 00:23:14,934
- Hee Jin, it's this way! - Listen to me!

693
00:23:14,935 --> 00:23:16,204
Be quiet!

694
00:23:16,205 --> 00:23:18,104
- Please! - Listen to me!

695
00:23:18,105 --> 00:23:19,233
Welcome!

696
00:23:19,234 --> 00:23:20,533
- Hello. - Okay!

697
00:23:20,534 --> 00:23:23,144
(She picks Team Comedians.)

698
00:23:23,145 --> 00:23:24,743
- High five. - Smile, smile, smile.

699
00:23:24,744 --> 00:23:25,874
(They're happy to have her.)

700
00:23:25,875 --> 00:23:27,721
- You picked us? That's great. - Hello.

701
00:23:27,984 --> 00:23:29,714
- Okay! - Good thinking.

702
00:23:29,715 --> 00:23:32,013
- Close the door. - Okay!

703
00:23:32,014 --> 00:23:33,313
Please!

704
00:23:33,314 --> 00:23:35,161
(Hee Jin, please.)

705
00:23:35,524 --> 00:23:37,799
- So Min, you... - What's wrong with you? Hey.

706
00:23:37,994 --> 00:23:39,484
I mean...

707
00:23:40,655 --> 00:23:43,143
I just want Jae Young to come.

708
00:23:43,994 --> 00:23:45,694
- Haha. - How can we understand her?

709
00:23:45,695 --> 00:23:47,367
You're both in relationships.

710
00:23:47,465 --> 00:23:49,604
- After we finish filming... - She really likes him.

711
00:23:49,605 --> 00:23:52,374
Still, this isn't right.

712
00:23:52,375 --> 00:23:55,404
Hee Jin opened our door. She chose us.

713
00:23:55,405 --> 00:23:56,573
I mean...

714
00:23:56,574 --> 00:23:58,411
Darn it. I'm not doing this.

715
00:23:58,645 --> 00:24:00,582
- I won't do this. - Me neither.

716
00:24:00,715 --> 00:24:01,944
- Gosh. - I'm serious.

717
00:24:01,945 --> 00:24:03,644
Hee Jin came, but...

718
00:24:03,645 --> 00:24:06,061
- So Min locked the door. - She locked the door.

719
00:24:06,155 --> 00:24:09,653
I'm not going to do this. So Min wants to date all she wants.

720
00:24:10,355 --> 00:24:12,670
- I'm so mad that she's serious. - Me too!

721
00:24:12,824 --> 00:24:14,498
What's going on?

722
00:24:14,625 --> 00:24:17,664
- Hee Jin. You got it all wrong. - So Min wants Jae Young.

723
00:24:17,665 --> 00:24:19,634
- Don't be so pathetic. - I mean...

724
00:24:19,635 --> 00:24:21,704
- The door didn't open. - She...

725
00:24:21,705 --> 00:24:23,333
- She locked it. - I didn't.

726
00:24:23,334 --> 00:24:25,003
- So Min did? - She locked it?

727
00:24:25,004 --> 00:24:27,174
- She locked it? - She wanted Jae Young.

728
00:24:27,175 --> 00:24:29,843
No wonder. She told me that I couldn't get in the car.

729
00:24:29,844 --> 00:24:31,242
- Really? - She said that.

730
00:24:31,314 --> 00:24:33,214
So I thought I wasn't supposed to get in there.

731
00:24:33,215 --> 00:24:35,714
I'm sorry, but you can't become a couple with anyone here.

732
00:24:35,715 --> 00:24:37,550
(Seok Jin barges in all of a sudden.)

733
00:24:38,155 --> 00:24:39,644
- I'm sorry. - He's right.

734
00:24:39,784 --> 00:24:41,424
- I'm sorry. - I'm sorry.

735
00:24:41,425 --> 00:24:42,884
We are sorry about that.

736
00:24:42,885 --> 00:24:44,762
(All the men are taken.)

737
00:24:45,425 --> 00:24:46,793
(Sullen)

738
00:24:46,794 --> 00:24:48,120
What is this mess?

739
00:24:48,994 --> 00:24:50,224
I'm so frustrated.

740
00:24:50,225 --> 00:24:52,533
- What is this? - I'm actually irritated by you.

741
00:24:52,534 --> 00:24:54,763
What is this? What you did was really weird.

742
00:24:54,764 --> 00:24:58,447
- I don't get this. - Jae Young better come here.

743
00:24:58,475 --> 00:25:00,474
- Promise us. - Goodness.

744
00:25:00,475 --> 00:25:02,178
They better not be the secret couple.

745
00:25:02,945 --> 00:25:04,874
- I'm so vexed. - He's here. Dance.

746
00:25:04,875 --> 00:25:07,670
- Who is it? - It's Jae Young. He's here.

747
00:25:09,185 --> 00:25:10,409
Jae Young.

748
00:25:10,885 --> 00:25:12,253
Jae Young.

749
00:25:12,254 --> 00:25:14,654
Go talk to him up there.

750
00:25:14,655 --> 00:25:15,823
Jae Young.

751
00:25:15,824 --> 00:25:16,978
Hold on.

752
00:25:17,284 --> 00:25:19,334
(She seems timid.)

753
00:25:20,395 --> 00:25:22,263
- It's Bona! - Go up.

754
00:25:22,264 --> 00:25:23,958
- Go up. - Are they both here?

755
00:25:24,635 --> 00:25:26,733
(Next to Jae Young who's won the top meal card...)

756
00:25:26,734 --> 00:25:27,959
(is Bona with the low meal card.)

757
00:25:28,105 --> 00:25:29,767
Oh, do we go and pick?

758
00:25:29,935 --> 00:25:31,362
They're both here.

759
00:25:31,804 --> 00:25:33,404
Jae Young.

760
00:25:33,405 --> 00:25:34,944
- Hold on. - There she is.

761
00:25:34,945 --> 00:25:36,474
So Min, do you want me?

762
00:25:36,475 --> 00:25:38,148
- No. - Do you want me?

763
00:25:38,415 --> 00:25:39,813
- Hello. - So Min, do you want me?

764
00:25:39,814 --> 00:25:41,483
(No, not you.)

765
00:25:41,484 --> 00:25:43,688
Jae Young. I want you.

766
00:25:44,084 --> 00:25:45,313
- Who's in this car? - Jae Young.

767
00:25:45,314 --> 00:25:46,513
Hello.

768
00:25:46,514 --> 00:25:47,753
I've saved a spot for you.

769
00:25:47,754 --> 00:25:49,884
- Did you? - Who's in this car?

770
00:25:49,885 --> 00:25:52,170
No one's in here.

771
00:25:52,294 --> 00:25:53,518
Go.

772
00:25:54,094 --> 00:25:56,307
Bona wants to get in. What should we do?

773
00:25:56,625 --> 00:25:57,920
Jae Young.

774
00:25:58,465 --> 00:25:59,763
(He looks for another way.)

775
00:25:59,764 --> 00:26:01,664
- Jae Young. - Yes? Me?

776
00:26:01,665 --> 00:26:02,964
Jae Young!

777
00:26:02,965 --> 00:26:03,964
(Haha plays a song for him.)

778
00:26:03,965 --> 00:26:05,333
Let's eat together.

779
00:26:05,334 --> 00:26:07,273
(What is this song?)

780
00:26:07,274 --> 00:26:08,644
Come in!

781
00:26:08,645 --> 00:26:10,613
Jae Young, why are you hesitating?

782
00:26:11,244 --> 00:26:12,642
Let's dance.

783
00:26:13,175 --> 00:26:15,184
Jae Young, let's eat something delicious together!

784
00:26:15,314 --> 00:26:16,914
I have something to tell you.

785
00:26:16,915 --> 00:26:19,384
So Min told Haha that Bona was going to get in.

786
00:26:19,385 --> 00:26:21,184
And he wanted Bona to get lost.

787
00:26:21,185 --> 00:26:23,424
I'm serious. Seriously.

788
00:26:23,425 --> 00:26:24,993
I swear.

789
00:26:24,994 --> 00:26:26,523
Hey, hold on!

790
00:26:26,524 --> 00:26:29,224
(The plan backfires, and Bona is more determined to get in.)

791
00:26:29,225 --> 00:26:31,408
- Hold on. - I'm so dumbfounded.

792
00:26:32,635 --> 00:26:34,165
- I'll get in here. - Okay!

793
00:26:35,205 --> 00:26:38,704
(Jae Young picks Team Hello Honey.)

794
00:26:38,705 --> 00:26:40,374
- Nice! - Jae Young!

795
00:26:40,375 --> 00:26:41,503
- Jae Young! - Please!

796
00:26:41,504 --> 00:26:43,239
- What's wrong with you? - Darn it!

797
00:26:43,274 --> 00:26:44,573
Why?

798
00:26:44,574 --> 00:26:46,073
(They can't believe it.)

799
00:26:46,074 --> 00:26:47,843
They'll beat you up there!

800
00:26:47,844 --> 00:26:49,483
- He's already in here! - Back up.

801
00:26:49,484 --> 00:26:51,454
- Your seat's too close up. - Hello.

802
00:26:51,584 --> 00:26:53,013
- All right. - Good thinking.

803
00:26:53,014 --> 00:26:54,684
(They're exhilarated to have him.)

804
00:26:54,685 --> 00:26:55,954
Let me talk casually to you.

805
00:26:55,955 --> 00:26:57,454
Me too.

806
00:26:57,455 --> 00:26:58,793
Jae Young.

807
00:26:58,794 --> 00:27:00,194
(The three teams have been settled.)

808
00:27:00,195 --> 00:27:01,857
I liked you from the start.

809
00:27:02,165 --> 00:27:03,464
(Team Youth is on their way to eat.)

810
00:27:03,465 --> 00:27:06,933
What I find the most suspicious is that...

811
00:27:07,365 --> 00:27:09,507
So Min didn't allow Hee Jin to get in.

812
00:27:09,564 --> 00:27:13,233
I just really wanted Jae Young to get in.

813
00:27:13,234 --> 00:27:16,406
Then the secret couple could be So Min and Jae Young.

814
00:27:16,605 --> 00:27:19,777
To me, So Min is just a desperate girl.

815
00:27:20,475 --> 00:27:21,843
(It's obvious.)

816
00:27:21,844 --> 00:27:23,214
She wants to date.

817
00:27:23,215 --> 00:27:26,083
But I was rejected. He doesn't like me, right?

818
00:27:26,084 --> 00:27:28,369
- No, not yet. - I chose you guys first.

819
00:27:28,554 --> 00:27:30,753
He told me that I could choose first.

820
00:27:30,754 --> 00:27:31,793
Why did he do that?

821
00:27:31,794 --> 00:27:34,548
I think he chose Ji Hyo over me.

822
00:27:34,865 --> 00:27:36,252
Right, Haha?

823
00:27:36,594 --> 00:27:37,864
We don't know for certain yet.

824
00:27:37,865 --> 00:27:39,194
(So Min's filming a dating show.)

825
00:27:39,195 --> 00:27:41,653
I won't be able to see him for half a day.

826
00:27:41,734 --> 00:27:43,033
- No, you'll see him. - Aren't we going to the same place?

827
00:27:43,034 --> 00:27:44,573
- We're going to the same place. - We are?

828
00:27:44,574 --> 00:27:46,273
But we won't be able to eat.

829
00:27:46,274 --> 00:27:48,204
I didn't know that.

830
00:27:48,205 --> 00:27:51,611
Had I known, I would've allowed Hee Jin to get in.

831
00:27:51,844 --> 00:27:53,712
I didn't have to stop her.

832
00:27:54,514 --> 00:27:57,135
This is nice. This is all right.

833
00:27:57,445 --> 00:27:58,884
- You look happy now. - I am.

834
00:27:58,885 --> 00:28:01,454
(Meanwhile, how is Jae Young doing?)

835
00:28:01,455 --> 00:28:03,053
What's your personality like?

836
00:28:03,054 --> 00:28:05,093
Are you reserved? Or are you...

837
00:28:05,094 --> 00:28:07,593
I'm not really reserved, but I feel inhibited in front of strangers.

838
00:28:07,594 --> 00:28:10,394
It's been a while since I last appeared on on a variety show.

839
00:28:10,395 --> 00:28:12,945
- Right. - So it's difficult.

840
00:28:12,994 --> 00:28:15,263
People like Jae Young are perfect for acting slow...

841
00:28:15,264 --> 00:28:17,803
- when they have a mission. - Right.

842
00:28:17,804 --> 00:28:19,303
People don't usually suspect them.

843
00:28:19,304 --> 00:28:22,104
They bait us when we don't suspect them.

844
00:28:22,105 --> 00:28:25,847
But people who act are naturally good at pretending.

845
00:28:26,115 --> 00:28:27,214
The mission?

846
00:28:27,215 --> 00:28:29,513
When we get missions, we pretend that...

847
00:28:29,514 --> 00:28:31,422
we're not feeling well that day.

848
00:28:31,484 --> 00:28:33,414
We pretend like we're sick.

849
00:28:33,415 --> 00:28:34,476
You're right.

850
00:28:35,084 --> 00:28:36,083
- We act tired. - But...

851
00:28:36,084 --> 00:28:38,624
But you looked pretty sick when you came today.

852
00:28:38,625 --> 00:28:40,194
I'm not sick.

853
00:28:40,195 --> 00:28:42,194
- I was feeling... - You looked sick,

854
00:28:42,195 --> 00:28:43,419
and you're a bit slow.

855
00:28:43,594 --> 00:28:45,563
This is a strange combination.

856
00:28:45,564 --> 00:28:48,797
- I'm just not used to this. - Is that so?

857
00:28:49,105 --> 00:28:51,704
Don't pretend, and show us your real self.

858
00:28:51,705 --> 00:28:53,061
He's suspecting us.

859
00:28:53,905 --> 00:28:56,251
Wouldn't the secret couple want to get in the same car?

860
00:28:56,504 --> 00:28:57,573
- You're right. - Right?

861
00:28:57,574 --> 00:28:58,573
That's possible.

862
00:28:58,574 --> 00:29:01,848
Do we look strange to you?

863
00:29:02,385 --> 00:29:03,414
My goodness.

864
00:29:03,415 --> 00:29:06,311
If you two were a couple,

865
00:29:06,554 --> 00:29:09,283
then you guys probably have a mission to complete.

866
00:29:09,284 --> 00:29:11,823
- Right. - Right.

867
00:29:11,824 --> 00:29:13,793
- Go on, and do it. - We held hands.

868
00:29:14,225 --> 00:29:16,093
- Right? - We held hands.

869
00:29:16,094 --> 00:29:17,394
(Ji Hyo grabs his hand.)

870
00:29:17,395 --> 00:29:18,516
You did.

871
00:29:19,665 --> 00:29:21,733
Why did you do it? Why?

872
00:29:21,734 --> 00:29:23,503
- She just did it. - I just did.

873
00:29:23,504 --> 00:29:26,463
You're not the type to suddenly grab a guest's hand.

874
00:29:26,804 --> 00:29:28,174
- She just... - His skin looked soft.

875
00:29:28,175 --> 00:29:31,305
See? Come on. What's wrong with you?

876
00:29:31,744 --> 00:29:32,944
You've aged.

877
00:29:32,945 --> 00:29:33,944
(She's not making any sense.)

878
00:29:33,945 --> 00:29:36,283
- She'll be 40 soon. - I just grabbed it.

879
00:29:36,284 --> 00:29:37,917
She'll be turning 40 soon.

880
00:29:38,155 --> 00:29:41,154
I just did that because you were suspecting us.

881
00:29:41,155 --> 00:29:42,684
But there's nothing going on.

882
00:29:42,685 --> 00:29:43,806
You're suspicious.

883
00:29:44,084 --> 00:29:46,502
If this isn't a mission, you're interested in him.

884
00:29:47,794 --> 00:29:49,093
I think it's 1 of those 2.

885
00:29:49,094 --> 00:29:50,093
(She says something strange.)

886
00:29:50,094 --> 00:29:52,833
So it's 1 of those 2. Okay.

887
00:29:52,834 --> 00:29:55,434
- But it's really not me. - Sure.

888
00:29:55,435 --> 00:29:58,003
But you know what? He could be the relationship virgin.

889
00:29:58,004 --> 00:30:02,084
Right. Many good-looking people are relationship virgins.

890
00:30:02,375 --> 00:30:05,067
If Jae Seok was the relationship virgin,

891
00:30:05,415 --> 00:30:06,496
it'd be too obvious.

892
00:30:07,645 --> 00:30:09,083
- Jae Seok? - It was strange.

893
00:30:09,084 --> 00:30:11,328
He was distancing himself today.

894
00:30:11,984 --> 00:30:13,614
He acted a bit differently today.

895
00:30:13,615 --> 00:30:14,706
(Jae Seok seemed a bit off.)

896
00:30:15,054 --> 00:30:17,573
- We don't need to worry about food. - Right.

897
00:30:18,395 --> 00:30:20,772
You look 25 years old.

898
00:30:22,425 --> 00:30:23,664
- Really? - She looks really young.

899
00:30:23,665 --> 00:30:26,551
- She looks like a college student. - Why are you smirking?

900
00:30:26,695 --> 00:30:28,704
- Because... - She seems to be in her early 30s.

901
00:30:28,705 --> 00:30:30,775
- She looks really young. - Eat up, senior.

902
00:30:30,834 --> 00:30:32,104
"Eat up, senior"?

903
00:30:32,105 --> 00:30:33,573
- Did you hear her? - I'll eat a lot.

904
00:30:33,574 --> 00:30:36,104
- Okay. - Compared to the past,

905
00:30:36,105 --> 00:30:37,474
- you've become more brazen. - I know.

906
00:30:37,475 --> 00:30:39,214
I'm also an emcee now.

907
00:30:39,215 --> 00:30:40,644
- I used to. - Which program?

908
00:30:40,645 --> 00:30:42,083
I was on a beauty program.

909
00:30:42,084 --> 00:30:43,343
- You're right. - A beauty emcee!

910
00:30:43,344 --> 00:30:44,640
- I... - A beauty emcee.

911
00:30:44,685 --> 00:30:46,813
- I could understand you. - What do you mean?

912
00:30:46,814 --> 00:30:49,354
I knew how hard it was to have a guest...

913
00:30:49,355 --> 00:30:51,333
- like me. - Right.

914
00:30:51,355 --> 00:30:53,553
I replied in short sentences and wasn't too talkative.

915
00:30:53,554 --> 00:30:55,359
- Right. - And I didn't look at you.

916
00:30:56,465 --> 00:31:00,293
(She did her best, but she was still awkward.)

917
00:31:00,294 --> 00:31:04,204
(She was a difficult guest for Jae Seok.)

918
00:31:04,205 --> 00:31:06,503
Now, I understand how you felt.

919
00:31:06,504 --> 00:31:07,803
- It's too late. - What?

920
00:31:07,804 --> 00:31:10,444
(It's a pity.)

921
00:31:10,445 --> 00:31:12,214
- It's been way too long. - What?

922
00:31:12,215 --> 00:31:14,714
- I can't believe... - I did my best, though.

923
00:31:14,715 --> 00:31:16,444
you now understood me.

924
00:31:16,445 --> 00:31:17,770
It's too late.

925
00:31:17,984 --> 00:31:19,719
- I'm sorry. - We're here.

926
00:31:19,915 --> 00:31:21,036
So Min.

927
00:31:21,984 --> 00:31:23,484
This place looks tasty.

928
00:31:23,685 --> 00:31:25,793
- Goodness. - I want a dolsot.

929
00:31:25,794 --> 00:31:27,454
- I want a dolsot. - Hey.

930
00:31:27,455 --> 00:31:28,993
That looks good.

931
00:31:28,994 --> 00:31:30,924
Jae Young must be busy receiving a mission.

932
00:31:30,925 --> 00:31:32,669
- You're right. - He's finally here.

933
00:31:32,695 --> 00:31:35,111
- Jae Young. - It must be hard to do a mission.

934
00:31:35,304 --> 00:31:37,783
- Yes. - Right?

935
00:31:37,905 --> 00:31:39,833
- "Yes"? What was that? - "Yes"?

936
00:31:39,834 --> 00:31:41,477
Hold his hand, Ji Hyo.

937
00:31:41,744 --> 00:31:43,104
- Hey. - It's not like that.

938
00:31:43,105 --> 00:31:44,444
They're suspicious.

939
00:31:44,445 --> 00:31:45,944
- The two of them? - Really?

940
00:31:45,945 --> 00:31:47,983
What is it?

941
00:31:47,984 --> 00:31:49,543
- Hey. - They're the secret couple.

942
00:31:49,544 --> 00:31:51,043
Jong Kook will kill you if you get caught.

943
00:31:51,044 --> 00:31:53,354
You know very well what will happen.

944
00:31:53,355 --> 00:31:55,684
He's the type to dig in.

945
00:31:55,685 --> 00:31:56,983
- It's not me. - He is.

946
00:31:56,984 --> 00:31:58,194
Something happened, right?

947
00:31:58,195 --> 00:32:00,439
They got in the car.

948
00:32:01,195 --> 00:32:02,493
But you all know that...

949
00:32:02,494 --> 00:32:04,394
Ji Hyo's not the type to take care of the guests.

950
00:32:04,395 --> 00:32:06,741
- Right. - She's a loner.

951
00:32:07,195 --> 00:32:09,733
But she was taking good care of him and then held his hand.

952
00:32:09,734 --> 00:32:11,305
(She suddenly held his hand.)

953
00:32:11,705 --> 00:32:12,795
What?

954
00:32:13,375 --> 00:32:15,303
- What's going on? - She's not the type...

955
00:32:15,304 --> 00:32:17,803
- to do that. - I've never seen her do that.

956
00:32:17,804 --> 00:32:19,674
I didn't grab his hand all of a sudden.

957
00:32:19,675 --> 00:32:21,144
It's a bit strange.

958
00:32:21,145 --> 00:32:23,914
I didn't suddenly grab it.

959
00:32:23,915 --> 00:32:26,454
He asked if we were the secret couple with a mission.

960
00:32:26,455 --> 00:32:29,454
He kept cornering me, so I just did it.

961
00:32:29,455 --> 00:32:31,464
Maybe that was your mission.

962
00:32:31,925 --> 00:32:33,894
- No. He kept cornering me. - Right.

963
00:32:33,895 --> 00:32:35,293
One more thing.

964
00:32:35,294 --> 00:32:37,303
- He kept cornering me. - This one's crucial.

965
00:32:37,425 --> 00:32:38,965
Hey, say something.

966
00:32:40,365 --> 00:32:43,533
Ji Hyo doesn't immediately speak casually to anyone.

967
00:32:43,534 --> 00:32:44,657
Right.

968
00:32:44,905 --> 00:32:47,474
She talked to him casually even before he got on.

969
00:32:47,475 --> 00:32:50,003
But even I hadn't spoken casually to him.

970
00:32:50,004 --> 00:32:53,444
Hold on. Did Ji Hyo sleep in the car or not?

971
00:32:53,445 --> 00:32:55,144
(Did Ji Hyo sleep in the car or not?)

972
00:32:55,145 --> 00:32:57,444
- She didn't. - You're suspicious!

973
00:32:57,445 --> 00:32:58,684
(She didn't?)

974
00:32:58,685 --> 00:33:00,283
- You're suspicious! - Ji Hyo!

975
00:33:00,284 --> 00:33:02,083
- Come here. - She's suspicious.

976
00:33:02,084 --> 00:33:03,253
- Hey. - Come here.

977
00:33:03,254 --> 00:33:04,784
- You're caught. - Come here.

978
00:33:05,155 --> 00:33:06,582
She's either the relationship virgin or they're the secret couple.

979
00:33:06,794 --> 00:33:07,793
You didn't sleep?

980
00:33:07,794 --> 00:33:09,624
- It's you, right? You didn't sleep? - She didn't.

981
00:33:09,625 --> 00:33:11,263
- It's not me. - She was...

982
00:33:11,264 --> 00:33:13,364
- very talkative. - No.

983
00:33:13,365 --> 00:33:15,883
- I... - She didn't stop talking.

984
00:33:16,365 --> 00:33:21,204
But hear me out. If we're not the secret couple,

985
00:33:21,205 --> 00:33:22,644
then Jong Kook is being jealous.

986
00:33:22,645 --> 00:33:24,204
- Listen to me. - I'm serious.

987
00:33:24,205 --> 00:33:26,214
(If they're not the secret couple, Jong Kook is just being jealous.)

988
00:33:26,215 --> 00:33:27,295
I'm serious.

989
00:33:27,375 --> 00:33:29,283
- Right? - Yes, I understand.

990
00:33:29,284 --> 00:33:30,684
You need to acknowledge that.

991
00:33:30,685 --> 00:33:32,184
- You need to. - I acknowledge.

992
00:33:32,185 --> 00:33:36,083
Look at how she's saying that since she's being cornered.

993
00:33:36,084 --> 00:33:39,093
- Jong Kook... - That team is suspicious.

994
00:33:39,094 --> 00:33:40,093
(What's the truth?)

995
00:33:40,094 --> 00:33:41,452
You should all eat first.

996
00:33:41,625 --> 00:33:42,890
- Thank you for the meal. - We can eat?

997
00:33:43,064 --> 00:33:45,464
- Let's eat. - Hee Jin, eat up.

998
00:33:45,465 --> 00:33:48,303
- Enjoy. - Thank you.

999
00:33:48,304 --> 00:33:50,069
It's pumpkin rice!

1000
00:33:50,705 --> 00:33:54,204
It's been a while since I last had a nice, warm meal.

1001
00:33:54,205 --> 00:33:56,743
(It's a feast full of nutritious foods.)

1002
00:33:56,744 --> 00:34:00,644
(Beef jeongol)

1003
00:34:00,645 --> 00:34:02,384
(Grilled yellow corvina)

1004
00:34:02,385 --> 00:34:04,644
(Korean-style raw beef)

1005
00:34:04,645 --> 00:34:06,384
Thanks to Jae Young...

1006
00:34:06,385 --> 00:34:08,384
- I know. - No, it's thanks to Ji Hyo.

1007
00:34:08,385 --> 00:34:11,493
Thanks to her, we're having such a delicious meal.

1008
00:34:11,494 --> 00:34:13,093
This looks really good.

1009
00:34:13,094 --> 00:34:14,656
We can't eat that, but that's not because of you.

1010
00:34:14,694 --> 00:34:15,989
Never.

1011
00:34:16,764 --> 00:34:19,181
Bona, don't be sorry. Ever.

1012
00:34:19,464 --> 00:34:21,882
(He's still mad.)

1013
00:34:22,165 --> 00:34:25,776
(But it makes her feel sorrier.)

1014
00:34:26,475 --> 00:34:29,770
So Min said she wanted to eat this like this.

1015
00:34:30,275 --> 00:34:31,644
You're right.

1016
00:34:31,645 --> 00:34:33,013
So Min, would you like some?

1017
00:34:33,014 --> 00:34:35,126
(Se Chan suddenly offers his fish.)

1018
00:34:35,214 --> 00:34:36,265
- I want it. - Come here.

1019
00:34:36,284 --> 00:34:37,509
What is this?

1020
00:34:38,154 --> 00:34:40,153
Why is Se Chan being so nice to me today?

1021
00:34:40,355 --> 00:34:41,548
Are you being jealous?

1022
00:34:41,685 --> 00:34:42,908
What is she talking about?

1023
00:34:43,654 --> 00:34:44,653
Eat.

1024
00:34:44,654 --> 00:34:45,993
- What are you doing? - Why did you give it to her?

1025
00:34:45,994 --> 00:34:47,148
Is it a mission?

1026
00:34:47,255 --> 00:34:49,233
(He feeds her.)

1027
00:34:49,424 --> 00:34:50,423
Is this a mission?

1028
00:34:50,424 --> 00:34:52,168
- Hey. - Are you insane?

1029
00:34:52,565 --> 00:34:53,834
I'm just taking care of her as a friend.

1030
00:34:53,835 --> 00:34:56,263
- You can't. - You should go now.

1031
00:34:56,264 --> 00:34:57,968
This is definitely a mission.

1032
00:34:58,735 --> 00:35:00,704
- I'm certain. - What did you do?

1033
00:35:00,705 --> 00:35:02,203
This has to be a mission.

1034
00:35:02,304 --> 00:35:04,518
It doesn't make sense if it isn't.

1035
00:35:04,645 --> 00:35:06,814
- Why did you give it to her? - You can't be like that.

1036
00:35:06,815 --> 00:35:08,684
I just wanted her to taste it.

1037
00:35:08,685 --> 00:35:10,484
You can't do that.

1038
00:35:10,485 --> 00:35:12,283
- You're acting strange. - He's being nice to me.

1039
00:35:12,284 --> 00:35:13,948
He's very suspicious.

1040
00:35:14,884 --> 00:35:16,486
What's going on?

1041
00:35:16,855 --> 00:35:18,180
- What do you want? - What do you need?

1042
00:35:18,395 --> 00:35:19,618
I'd like a piece of the vegetable pancake.

1043
00:35:19,855 --> 00:35:23,129
(What? The vegetable pancake?)

1044
00:35:23,494 --> 00:35:25,894
- Oh, this one? - No, you can't!

1045
00:35:25,895 --> 00:35:27,193
(Why are you helping her?)

1046
00:35:27,194 --> 00:35:29,604
Why did you get it for her? Why?

1047
00:35:29,605 --> 00:35:30,604
Why did you?

1048
00:35:30,605 --> 00:35:32,204
I just want it.

1049
00:35:32,205 --> 00:35:33,374
Why did he get it for you?

1050
00:35:33,375 --> 00:35:35,004
- Because I wanted it. - What's going on?

1051
00:35:35,005 --> 00:35:36,704
Look at this.

1052
00:35:36,705 --> 00:35:38,814
She could reach it, but she didn't.

1053
00:35:38,815 --> 00:35:39,937
- She kept hesitating. - Jong Kook.

1054
00:35:40,174 --> 00:35:41,816
- So he got it for her. - Jong Kook.

1055
00:35:42,045 --> 00:35:43,914
Up until a while ago, I could understand you.

1056
00:35:43,915 --> 00:35:46,084
- But this is jealousy. - No, it isn't.

1057
00:35:46,085 --> 00:35:47,984
(I'm speaking objectively.)

1058
00:35:47,985 --> 00:35:49,883
- You're making us uncomfortable. - It's not true.

1059
00:35:49,884 --> 00:35:51,693
- Jong Kook. - She's not that type.

1060
00:35:51,694 --> 00:35:53,524
- You're being too jealous. - Look.

1061
00:35:53,525 --> 00:35:55,894
Look. She did this, but she didn't pick it up.

1062
00:35:55,895 --> 00:35:57,093
(She wouldn't just accept food from anyone.)

1063
00:35:57,094 --> 00:35:59,175
- She did that three times. - Just be quiet and eat.

1064
00:36:00,665 --> 00:36:02,564
(You're right. He's jealous.)

1065
00:36:02,565 --> 00:36:04,704
(She talks badly about Jong Kook...)

1066
00:36:04,705 --> 00:36:07,051
(and receives food in exchange.)

1067
00:36:07,505 --> 00:36:08,943
(Stealthily)

1068
00:36:08,944 --> 00:36:10,374
(She bites his food.)

1069
00:36:10,375 --> 00:36:11,374
She did that three times.

1070
00:36:11,375 --> 00:36:13,313
(She's happy.)

1071
00:36:14,444 --> 00:36:16,984
Jae Young gave this to me. He put it inside my mouth.

1072
00:36:16,985 --> 00:36:18,553
Everyone is suspicious today!

1073
00:36:18,554 --> 00:36:20,829
(He can't take it anymore.)

1074
00:36:20,915 --> 00:36:22,659
So Min isn't even focused.

1075
00:36:23,784 --> 00:36:26,477
(Snatching)

1076
00:36:26,525 --> 00:36:28,363
She said Jae Young fed her.

1077
00:36:28,364 --> 00:36:29,524
Hey!

1078
00:36:29,525 --> 00:36:31,096
And Kwang Soo stole it.

1079
00:36:31,364 --> 00:36:32,934
I'm actually a part of the secret couple!

1080
00:36:32,935 --> 00:36:34,164
As if! Sit down!

1081
00:36:34,165 --> 00:36:36,888
(Sit down, relationship virgin!)

1082
00:36:37,404 --> 00:36:39,476
You're the relationship virgin.

1083
00:36:40,275 --> 00:36:42,722
Jong Kook can't focus on anything other than those two.

1084
00:36:43,545 --> 00:36:45,943
I'm pretty sure that he's just jealous now.

1085
00:36:45,944 --> 00:36:47,673
- I hope so. - He's definitely jealous.

1086
00:36:47,674 --> 00:36:49,243
That is jealousy for sure.

1087
00:36:49,244 --> 00:36:50,243
- Hey. - He's obsessed with her.

1088
00:36:50,244 --> 00:36:52,254
If you're not jealous,

1089
00:36:52,255 --> 00:36:53,887
please give me some raw beef.

1090
00:36:54,384 --> 00:36:57,241
(She suddenly asks for some raw beef.)

1091
00:36:57,725 --> 00:36:59,423
- Jong Kook isn't that stupid. - Really?

1092
00:36:59,424 --> 00:37:01,025
He won't fall for that.

1093
00:37:01,094 --> 00:37:04,389
I heard you danced back in the jungle.

1094
00:37:04,725 --> 00:37:07,794
If Bona dances on behalf of her team,

1095
00:37:07,795 --> 00:37:09,504
- please give us some raw beef. - Well...

1096
00:37:09,505 --> 00:37:12,055
- Okay, we will. - If it's entertaining, we will.

1097
00:37:12,435 --> 00:37:14,374
All of us, including me, will be embarrassed.

1098
00:37:14,375 --> 00:37:15,943
It's nice. They like that.

1099
00:37:15,944 --> 00:37:18,046
- I'll give you the beat. - Really?

1100
00:37:18,074 --> 00:37:19,135
Yes.

1101
00:37:19,174 --> 00:37:21,113
- 1, 2, - 2.

1102
00:37:21,114 --> 00:37:23,283
- She's so adorable. - 1, 2, 3, 4.

1103
00:37:23,284 --> 00:37:25,513
(What is this fantastic dance that she'll be performing?)

1104
00:37:25,514 --> 00:37:26,783
- 2, 3, 4. - 2, 3, 4.

1105
00:37:26,784 --> 00:37:28,984
(She flails her arms around.)

1106
00:37:28,985 --> 00:37:31,953
(It looks complicated and fancy...)

1107
00:37:33,694 --> 00:37:34,847
(Everyone is embarrassed.)

1108
00:37:35,395 --> 00:37:37,843
(Why should her team members be embarrassed?)

1109
00:37:38,295 --> 00:37:40,463
(Nevertheless, she keeps going.)

1110
00:37:40,464 --> 00:37:41,633
Goodness.

1111
00:37:41,634 --> 00:37:43,337
- It's her choreography. - Yes.

1112
00:37:43,364 --> 00:37:44,463
It's the choreography.

1113
00:37:44,464 --> 00:37:45,831
(This dance is...)

1114
00:37:47,775 --> 00:37:50,905
(supposed to look splendid like so.)

1115
00:37:51,674 --> 00:37:55,051
(But without the music,)

1116
00:37:55,844 --> 00:37:58,232
(it looks rather embarrassing.)

1117
00:37:59,054 --> 00:38:00,153
- It's the choreography. - Goodness.

1118
00:38:00,154 --> 00:38:02,624
- Yes, it is. - She needs to be rewarded,

1119
00:38:02,625 --> 00:38:03,982
- Se Chan. - Bona.

1120
00:38:04,255 --> 00:38:05,354
You can take one of those shrimps marinated in say sauce.

1121
00:38:05,355 --> 00:38:07,493
Thank you for the food.

1122
00:38:07,494 --> 00:38:09,738
Bona, you can have this.

1123
00:38:10,464 --> 00:38:11,863
This is delicious.

1124
00:38:11,864 --> 00:38:12,986
It is.

1125
00:38:13,134 --> 00:38:14,234
Go on, try it, Bona.

1126
00:38:14,235 --> 00:38:15,363
(Mealtime is finished as a few suspects have revealed themselves.)

1127
00:38:15,364 --> 00:38:17,064
They're all good.

1128
00:38:17,065 --> 00:38:18,401
(Mealtime is finished as a few suspects have revealed themselves.)

1129
00:38:19,375 --> 00:38:21,604
- Did everyone enjoy the meal? - Yes!

1130
00:38:21,605 --> 00:38:23,715
Your first mission to get hints is...

1131
00:38:24,244 --> 00:38:26,613
Paradise for singles, fiery pit for couples.

1132
00:38:26,614 --> 00:38:28,613
(Paradise for singles, fiery pit for couples.)

1133
00:38:28,614 --> 00:38:30,584
We'll give you questions regarding relationships,

1134
00:38:30,744 --> 00:38:32,513
and the team with the right answer...

1135
00:38:32,514 --> 00:38:35,922
gets to pour two buckets of water...

1136
00:38:35,955 --> 00:38:38,493
into other teams' bowls of their choice.

1137
00:38:38,494 --> 00:38:42,323
The team with the bowl full is...

1138
00:38:42,324 --> 00:38:43,517
- Eliminated? - eliminated.

1139
00:38:44,464 --> 00:38:45,790
The two losing team...

1140
00:38:46,295 --> 00:38:48,963
will be soaked in water from the bucket.

1141
00:38:48,964 --> 00:38:50,763
You could say I'm a bit...

1142
00:38:50,764 --> 00:38:52,978
of a veteran coach of relationships.

1143
00:38:53,574 --> 00:38:55,584
He's my coach.

1144
00:38:55,705 --> 00:38:57,582
I did help Kwang Soo...

1145
00:38:57,605 --> 00:38:59,073
with his relationship.

1146
00:38:59,074 --> 00:39:00,814
I signed up for his class too.

1147
00:39:00,815 --> 00:39:02,013
(I signed up for his class too.)

1148
00:39:02,014 --> 00:39:03,743
- To get advice from him. - You'll be surprised...

1149
00:39:03,744 --> 00:39:06,437
by how many celebrities are taking advice from me.

1150
00:39:06,815 --> 00:39:08,110
He's my relationship compass.

1151
00:39:09,225 --> 00:39:10,755
First question.

1152
00:39:10,784 --> 00:39:13,794
According to the research team of the University of Exeter,

1153
00:39:13,795 --> 00:39:15,093
A research team, good.

1154
00:39:15,094 --> 00:39:19,294
Your lover's "this" makes you live longer.

1155
00:39:19,295 --> 00:39:20,559
- Bona! - Let me answer!

1156
00:39:20,634 --> 00:39:21,704
So Min.

1157
00:39:21,705 --> 00:39:22,734
Your lover's kiss.

1158
00:39:22,735 --> 00:39:24,744
(Your lover's kiss.)

1159
00:39:24,864 --> 00:39:26,405
- I was going to say that. - I think she's right.

1160
00:39:27,674 --> 00:39:30,154
- What? - Let me answer!

1161
00:39:31,145 --> 00:39:32,235
Nagging.

1162
00:39:32,674 --> 00:39:34,307
- Nagging? - Yes.

1163
00:39:35,315 --> 00:39:37,425
- What's he saying? - No, obsession!

1164
00:39:37,514 --> 00:39:39,383
- Obsession. - Nagging or obsession?

1165
00:39:39,384 --> 00:39:41,513
- Obsession! - 1, 2, 3.

1166
00:39:41,514 --> 00:39:42,584
Nagging.

1167
00:39:42,585 --> 00:39:45,205
(Nagging.)

1168
00:39:47,025 --> 00:39:49,664
(He does not stick to an answer.)

1169
00:39:49,665 --> 00:39:51,834
- Choose one. - I'll say your lover's nagging.

1170
00:39:51,835 --> 00:39:53,017
Nagging.

1171
00:39:53,364 --> 00:39:54,557
- Your lover's nagging? - Let's go with that.

1172
00:39:54,594 --> 00:39:55,828
Let me answer!

1173
00:39:55,964 --> 00:39:57,536
- Hug! - Hug?

1174
00:39:58,105 --> 00:39:59,334
Let her answer!

1175
00:39:59,335 --> 00:40:00,903
- She's got it. - Let's go, Hee Jin!

1176
00:40:00,904 --> 00:40:02,578
- Let's go! - The queen of love.

1177
00:40:02,904 --> 00:40:04,607
- Jealousy. - Jealousy?

1178
00:40:04,975 --> 00:40:06,168
Wrong answer.

1179
00:40:06,344 --> 00:40:07,364
Wrong answer?

1180
00:40:07,815 --> 00:40:09,943
Let me tell you one more time.

1181
00:40:09,944 --> 00:40:11,084
Listen carefully.

1182
00:40:11,085 --> 00:40:12,278
There's a hint in the question.

1183
00:40:12,585 --> 00:40:14,593
It's not "this between lovers".

1184
00:40:15,255 --> 00:40:18,923
It's "lover's this" lets you live longer.

1185
00:40:18,924 --> 00:40:20,077
Let me answer!

1186
00:40:20,525 --> 00:40:22,963
(What's he going to say now?)

1187
00:40:22,964 --> 00:40:24,087
Lover's...

1188
00:40:24,594 --> 00:40:25,693
fart.

1189
00:40:25,694 --> 00:40:27,673
(Fart lets you live longer?)

1190
00:40:27,895 --> 00:40:29,934
(What nonsense is he babbling?)

1191
00:40:29,935 --> 00:40:31,363
- Correct! - Really?

1192
00:40:31,364 --> 00:40:32,533
- For real? - No way!

1193
00:40:32,534 --> 00:40:34,234
- No way! - What?

1194
00:40:34,235 --> 00:40:35,803
It's correct!

1195
00:40:35,804 --> 00:40:37,443
- That can't be right. - Is this for real?

1196
00:40:37,444 --> 00:40:39,414
- I wasn't even trying. - No way.

1197
00:40:39,415 --> 00:40:41,713
They say the hydrogen sulfide in there...

1198
00:40:41,714 --> 00:40:43,443
protects our cells.

1199
00:40:43,444 --> 00:40:45,283
- That makes no sense. - It reduces the risk of...

1200
00:40:45,284 --> 00:40:48,549
cancer, heart attack, arthritis, and dementia.

1201
00:40:49,054 --> 00:40:50,984
I should fart more at home.

1202
00:40:50,985 --> 00:40:53,300
We gave out farts when we were little,

1203
00:40:53,324 --> 00:40:55,027
it was like giving them vitamins.

1204
00:40:55,264 --> 00:40:56,263
It was just vitamins.

1205
00:40:56,264 --> 00:40:57,794
You could say you're...

1206
00:40:57,795 --> 00:40:59,294
- giving a part of your life. - Right.

1207
00:40:59,295 --> 00:41:00,834
- Or your own nutrition. - Right.

1208
00:41:00,835 --> 00:41:02,363
Please choose and pour...

1209
00:41:02,364 --> 00:41:03,934
two buckets of water.

1210
00:41:03,935 --> 00:41:05,873
- That's one bucket. - This is surprising.

1211
00:41:06,304 --> 00:41:08,303
- I did not expect that answer. - You're giving it to us?

1212
00:41:08,304 --> 00:41:10,573
(You want to give it to us without hesitation?)

1213
00:41:10,574 --> 00:41:11,767
Bona.

1214
00:41:12,214 --> 00:41:13,337
Let go of your bowl.

1215
00:41:14,045 --> 00:41:15,442
She's really cute.

1216
00:41:15,714 --> 00:41:17,347
- She is. - Go easy on us.

1217
00:41:17,514 --> 00:41:18,684
You don't want to give it to us.

1218
00:41:18,685 --> 00:41:20,418
- I'll give you a pass. - Yes!

1219
00:41:20,554 --> 00:41:22,666
Here, hold it. I'll let Bona off the hook.

1220
00:41:23,255 --> 00:41:25,672
Splash it right on her face!

1221
00:41:26,295 --> 00:41:27,478
Splash it!

1222
00:41:27,824 --> 00:41:30,273
Help me, So Min. I'm giving one bucket for each team.

1223
00:41:30,364 --> 00:41:31,966
- One for each? - One for each?

1224
00:41:32,735 --> 00:41:34,367
Hee Jin will give the second bucket.

1225
00:41:34,395 --> 00:41:36,037
Give it to a suspicious team.

1226
00:41:36,105 --> 00:41:38,064
You have nothing to doubt us about.

1227
00:41:38,065 --> 00:41:39,431
You have nothing to doubt us about.

1228
00:41:40,134 --> 00:41:43,032
(Who she doubts as the secret couple is...)

1229
00:41:43,875 --> 00:41:45,241
Good, that's a good choice.

1230
00:41:45,315 --> 00:41:46,498
Why us?

1231
00:41:47,844 --> 00:41:49,144
(Jae Young and Ji Hyo look suspicious.)

1232
00:41:49,145 --> 00:41:50,614
- Fine. - Okay.

1233
00:41:51,784 --> 00:41:52,854
(Ji Hyo is depressed.)

1234
00:41:52,855 --> 00:41:54,283
Second question.

1235
00:41:54,355 --> 00:41:56,975
Who's gone through a breakup should know the answer to this.

1236
00:41:57,955 --> 00:42:00,193
According to the research team of Monmouth University in the US,

1237
00:42:00,194 --> 00:42:01,454
Monmouth?

1238
00:42:01,455 --> 00:42:03,463
- I've never heard of these names. - Monmouth?

1239
00:42:03,525 --> 00:42:06,931
- Monmouth University. - Monmouth.

1240
00:42:06,935 --> 00:42:10,638
It takes this long to get over...

1241
00:42:11,264 --> 00:42:14,599
a breakup with your lover.

1242
00:42:15,674 --> 00:42:17,474
How long is this?

1243
00:42:17,475 --> 00:42:18,566
Let me answer!

1244
00:42:19,114 --> 00:42:20,314
Six months!

1245
00:42:20,315 --> 00:42:21,644
(6 months.)

1246
00:42:21,645 --> 00:42:22,909
- Let me answer. - Let me answer.

1247
00:42:24,145 --> 00:42:25,584
- Ten years. - What?

1248
00:42:25,585 --> 00:42:26,707
(10 years.)

1249
00:42:27,185 --> 00:42:29,624
(I will not forget about you for a decade.)

1250
00:42:29,625 --> 00:42:30,783
- Seriously? - Let me answer!

1251
00:42:30,784 --> 00:42:32,053
- Let me answer! - Let me answer!

1252
00:42:32,054 --> 00:42:33,624
(10 years is the wrong answer.)

1253
00:42:33,625 --> 00:42:35,153
Let me answer! I'm sure about this.

1254
00:42:35,154 --> 00:42:36,420
3 months. It's 3 months.

1255
00:42:36,824 --> 00:42:38,323
- Why are you so sure about it? - What?

1256
00:42:38,324 --> 00:42:40,231
- Why are you so sure? - You know, just average...

1257
00:42:40,464 --> 00:42:42,363
Three months is...

1258
00:42:42,364 --> 00:42:44,403
- You register a gym for 3 months. - I think he's right.

1259
00:42:44,404 --> 00:42:45,557
And then it's six months.

1260
00:42:46,074 --> 00:42:47,474
(It's all about the gym for him. 3 months is correct!)

1261
00:42:47,475 --> 00:42:49,036
It's usually 3 months.

1262
00:42:49,074 --> 00:42:50,676
- That's correct? - Oh, really?

1263
00:42:50,775 --> 00:42:52,173
It took more than three months for me.

1264
00:42:52,174 --> 00:42:54,489
That can't be right. You guys forget after 3 months?

1265
00:42:54,545 --> 00:42:56,043
That's American style.

1266
00:42:56,284 --> 00:42:57,406
Three months on average?

1267
00:42:57,714 --> 00:42:59,417
But So Min said "10 years".

1268
00:42:59,554 --> 00:43:02,553
So you're seeing someone else, and you think about your ex?

1269
00:43:02,554 --> 00:43:04,783
But when I meet someone new,

1270
00:43:04,784 --> 00:43:06,325
I forget about my ex.

1271
00:43:06,395 --> 00:43:08,638
That was the case for me.

1272
00:43:08,665 --> 00:43:10,763
Bona, how long do you think...

1273
00:43:10,764 --> 00:43:12,498
you take to forget someone?

1274
00:43:12,835 --> 00:43:14,875
I'd say...

1275
00:43:15,335 --> 00:43:18,033
- I'd say... - I'd say...

1276
00:43:18,034 --> 00:43:20,734
(She's at a loss of words because of a sudden question.)

1277
00:43:20,735 --> 00:43:23,374
She claims that she hasn't met anyone,

1278
00:43:23,375 --> 00:43:25,104
- Right. - so she has nothing to say.

1279
00:43:25,105 --> 00:43:26,808
- She's got a lot on her mind. - I will...

1280
00:43:27,174 --> 00:43:28,501
tell you in 4 years.

1281
00:43:29,244 --> 00:43:31,243
- Your contract ends in 4 years? - Yes, my contract.

1282
00:43:31,244 --> 00:43:32,783
She's...

1283
00:43:32,784 --> 00:43:34,111
That was smart.

1284
00:43:35,014 --> 00:43:36,350
So, it's three months.

1285
00:43:36,784 --> 00:43:38,323
It takes 3 months on average.

1286
00:43:38,324 --> 00:43:39,784
I feel bitter.

1287
00:43:39,895 --> 00:43:41,754
- Why don't you give them around? - Me?

1288
00:43:41,755 --> 00:43:42,963
- You choose the teams. - Yes, you should.

1289
00:43:42,964 --> 00:43:44,463
We've never attacked your team.

1290
00:43:44,464 --> 00:43:45,993
- You should know that. - Jae Young!

1291
00:43:45,994 --> 00:43:47,633
- That team's a smarter choice. - Is it?

1292
00:43:47,634 --> 00:43:49,463
- No, choose his team! - I mean, that's not right.

1293
00:43:49,464 --> 00:43:51,204
- Jae Young. - You don't attack us,

1294
00:43:51,205 --> 00:43:52,601
- we don't attack you. - They need a bucket!

1295
00:43:52,634 --> 00:43:54,133
- We're going to choose... - No, no!

1296
00:43:54,134 --> 00:43:56,243
- the other team. - They want a bucket!

1297
00:43:56,244 --> 00:43:58,316
Now you can choose to pour one more there.

1298
00:43:58,375 --> 00:44:00,274
Jae Young, it's time for this team.

1299
00:44:00,275 --> 00:44:02,121
You don't attack us, we don't attack you.

1300
00:44:02,545 --> 00:44:04,421
- Jae Young. - Two buckets?

1301
00:44:04,444 --> 00:44:06,188
You pour that bucket in our bowl,

1302
00:44:06,255 --> 00:44:07,553
you go out with So Min.

1303
00:44:07,554 --> 00:44:09,883
(You pour that bucket here, you go out with So Min.)

1304
00:44:09,884 --> 00:44:11,660
Why did you say that?

1305
00:44:12,355 --> 00:44:14,153
(She's trying to keep a straight face.)

1306
00:44:14,154 --> 00:44:16,064
- Why! - You like it, don't you?

1307
00:44:16,065 --> 00:44:17,493
He's not okay with it!

1308
00:44:17,494 --> 00:44:19,234
- How do you know? - Jae Young.

1309
00:44:19,235 --> 00:44:21,463
You pour that bucket in our bowl,

1310
00:44:21,464 --> 00:44:22,863
Seok Jin will be your agent starting tomorrow.

1311
00:44:22,864 --> 00:44:25,048
(You pour that bucket in here, Seok Jin becomes your agent.)

1312
00:44:25,065 --> 00:44:27,334
(Hello, Jae Young. I'm your new agent.)

1313
00:44:27,335 --> 00:44:28,573
You'll have to take care of him then.

1314
00:44:28,574 --> 00:44:29,666
It must be awkward.

1315
00:44:29,705 --> 00:44:30,704
I'm coming to pick you up,

1316
00:44:30,705 --> 00:44:31,765
but you're driving.

1317
00:44:32,574 --> 00:44:34,243
Can you trust him with your car?

1318
00:44:34,244 --> 00:44:36,343
(Pour a bucket of water,)

1319
00:44:36,344 --> 00:44:39,783
(and date So Min.)

1320
00:44:39,784 --> 00:44:43,553
(Or pour a bucket of water, and drag your elderly agent around.)

1321
00:44:43,554 --> 00:44:45,153
(Jae Young will choose.)

1322
00:44:45,154 --> 00:44:46,724
- I'll pour here. - Good!

1323
00:44:46,725 --> 00:44:49,141
(He chose to date So Min.)

1324
00:44:49,525 --> 00:44:51,093
(It beats having Seok Jin as your agent.)

1325
00:44:51,094 --> 00:44:52,491
You and I are going out.

1326
00:44:52,565 --> 00:44:53,758
Pour it, Jae Young!

1327
00:44:53,895 --> 00:44:55,495
- A new couple! - A new couple!

1328
00:44:56,904 --> 00:44:58,303
(He found a lover with a bucket of water.)

1329
00:44:58,304 --> 00:44:59,426
Congratulations.

1330
00:44:59,605 --> 00:45:01,512
- Okay! - Get his number!

1331
00:45:01,605 --> 00:45:04,358
I didn't know pouring water could be this exciting.

1332
00:45:04,545 --> 00:45:05,874
(His heart is racing.)

1333
00:45:05,875 --> 00:45:08,274
She's excited. So Min likes it.

1334
00:45:08,275 --> 00:45:09,544
Kwang Soo is my role model.

1335
00:45:09,545 --> 00:45:10,943
(Kwang Soo is my role model.)

1336
00:45:10,944 --> 00:45:12,984
- As in dating your guest member? - What are you talking about?

1337
00:45:12,985 --> 00:45:17,411
(He broke the walls with the power of love.)

1338
00:45:17,455 --> 00:45:19,566
I heard Jae Seok was Kwang Soo's role model.

1339
00:45:19,855 --> 00:45:21,423
Because he found his wife at work.

1340
00:45:21,424 --> 00:45:22,423
Like the coach, like the student.

1341
00:45:22,424 --> 00:45:23,823
- That's right. - That's right.

1342
00:45:23,824 --> 00:45:25,090
Now I'm connecting the dots.

1343
00:45:25,165 --> 00:45:26,934
It all relates in the end.

1344
00:45:26,935 --> 00:45:28,363
(From Jae Seok to Kwang Soo, and now to So Min.)

1345
00:45:28,364 --> 00:45:30,272
- Next question. - Let's get this one right.

1346
00:45:30,304 --> 00:45:32,204
- So we can pour it to them. - To the pink team.

1347
00:45:32,205 --> 00:45:33,428
They only have about two buckets to go.

1348
00:45:33,475 --> 00:45:34,862
We're almost there.

1349
00:45:35,074 --> 00:45:36,166
According to...

1350
00:45:36,744 --> 00:45:38,843
the research team at the University of Sterling in the UK,

1351
00:45:38,844 --> 00:45:40,272
(According to the research team at the University of Sterling.)

1352
00:45:40,645 --> 00:45:41,743
(They're about to listen to all the reports on relationships.)

1353
00:45:41,744 --> 00:45:42,836
Another research?

1354
00:45:42,884 --> 00:45:44,312
Research is good.

1355
00:45:44,784 --> 00:45:48,324
When people find an attractive person of opposite sex,

1356
00:45:48,824 --> 00:45:51,374
this changes first.

1357
00:45:51,625 --> 00:45:52,778
- Male or female? - Me!

1358
00:45:52,855 --> 00:45:54,119
- What is this? - Let me answer!

1359
00:45:54,525 --> 00:45:55,820
My answer is their smile.

1360
00:45:56,395 --> 00:45:57,485
- Smile? - Yes.

1361
00:45:57,724 --> 00:45:59,258
- Let me answer! - Gender doesn't matter?

1362
00:45:59,394 --> 00:46:01,186
- Let me answer! - Gender doesn't matter?

Voice.

1367
00:46:12,805 --> 00:46:14,263
- She said "voice". - Their voice.

1368
00:46:14,504 --> 00:46:15,657
Correct!

1369
00:46:16,375 --> 00:46:17,974
That was easier than I thought.

1370
00:46:17,975 --> 00:46:19,881
- That was too easy. - Their voice changes?

1371
00:46:20,205 --> 00:46:21,674
- That's easy. - Oh, really?

1372
00:46:22,074 --> 00:46:23,135
Let's go.

1373
00:46:23,275 --> 00:46:24,570
Me again?

1374
00:46:24,645 --> 00:46:25,914
Yes, you go ahead.

1375
00:46:25,915 --> 00:46:27,821
- Me? - Yes, you choose.

1376
00:46:28,485 --> 00:46:30,392
- Fill up theirs. - Yes, fill it up.

1377
00:46:30,554 --> 00:46:33,206
- Let's start by eliminating a team. - Right.

1378
00:46:33,225 --> 00:46:34,254
Jae Young!

1379
00:46:34,255 --> 00:46:35,724
- Think about So Min. - Yes?

1380
00:46:35,725 --> 00:46:37,081
If you have a tiny bit of feelings for her...

1381
00:46:37,154 --> 00:46:39,124
Oh, please. Stop it.

1382
00:46:39,125 --> 00:46:40,323
If you have feelings...

1383
00:46:40,324 --> 00:46:42,231
You go watch a movie with her,

1384
00:46:42,694 --> 00:46:44,734
have a drink, and take her home, then fine.

1385
00:46:44,735 --> 00:46:45,734
(If you're going to ask her out on a date, we'll take it.)

1386
00:46:45,735 --> 00:46:46,887
We'll take it.

1387
00:46:47,955 --> 00:46:50,623
(Will they able to go...)

1388
00:46:50,624 --> 00:46:53,393
(on a date over a bucket of water?)

1389
00:46:53,394 --> 00:46:55,594
- I'll pour it over there. - Why?

1390
00:46:55,595 --> 00:46:56,920
(He practically asked her out on a date.)

1391
00:46:56,995 --> 00:46:58,595
- Why! - What does this mean?

1392
00:46:58,765 --> 00:47:01,040
- What does this mean? - He likes you!

1393
00:47:01,064 --> 00:47:02,264
Then, well...

1394
00:47:02,265 --> 00:47:04,134
- We have no choice but to take it. - Jae Young.

1395
00:47:04,135 --> 00:47:05,304
Pour it like a man.

1396
00:47:05,305 --> 00:47:06,395
- He did it like a man. - Like a man.

1397
00:47:07,334 --> 00:47:08,426
Good.

1398
00:47:09,604 --> 00:47:12,195
You have to do it this week.

1399
00:47:12,314 --> 00:47:13,943
- It's still not filled up. - It's not.

1400
00:47:13,944 --> 00:47:16,184
- It's not. - They need one more.

1401
00:47:16,185 --> 00:47:18,295
If we get it right this time, we'll pour it in there.

1402
00:47:18,385 --> 00:47:20,014
Allies for this round?

1403
00:47:20,015 --> 00:47:21,424
- Sure, allies. - Allies.

1404
00:47:21,425 --> 00:47:23,393
- Don't do that. - They need to be kept in check!

1405
00:47:23,524 --> 00:47:25,623
Think about the big picture here.

1406
00:47:25,624 --> 00:47:27,724
- I'll take them out to be sure. - We got his command.

1407
00:47:27,725 --> 00:47:28,893
Are you sure about this?

1408
00:47:28,894 --> 00:47:30,264
You pour it in there...

1409
00:47:30,265 --> 00:47:32,305
I think it's right to do so.

1410
00:47:32,535 --> 00:47:34,227
- Take them out. - No!

1411
00:47:35,104 --> 00:47:37,176
- It's far from full yet. - We need to get the next question.

1412
00:47:37,334 --> 00:47:38,629
We just have to guess the right answer.

1413
00:47:38,675 --> 00:47:40,134
Kwang Soo's going to try harder now.

1414
00:47:40,135 --> 00:47:41,399
- I'm going to get the right answer. - Let's get it.

1415
00:47:41,575 --> 00:47:42,870
He hurt my feelings.

1416
00:47:44,104 --> 00:47:45,165
Next question, please.

1417
00:47:45,774 --> 00:47:46,873
According to...

1418
00:47:46,874 --> 00:47:49,873
the research of the State University of New York...

1419
00:47:49,914 --> 00:47:51,240
Now I know the way Americans date.

1420
00:47:52,084 --> 00:47:56,424
When a small argument or conflict...

1421
00:47:56,425 --> 00:47:58,454
between a couple is leading up to a breakup,

1422
00:47:58,455 --> 00:47:59,454
- Yes. - Yes.

1423
00:47:59,455 --> 00:48:02,023
you can overcome the crisis with this solution.

1424
00:48:02,024 --> 00:48:05,233
What is this solution?

1425
00:48:05,234 --> 00:48:06,254
- I have an answer. - I have an answer.

1426
00:48:07,234 --> 00:48:08,503
(Kwang Soo who figured out the American relationship style.)

1427
00:48:08,504 --> 00:48:09,563
A passionate kiss.

1428
00:48:09,564 --> 00:48:11,204
(American relationship style, a passionate kiss.)

1429
00:48:11,205 --> 00:48:12,562
Incorrect.

1430
00:48:13,274 --> 00:48:14,703
- Like physical affection... - I have an answer.

1431
00:48:15,044 --> 00:48:16,166
I have an answer.

1432
00:48:16,805 --> 00:48:19,114
They swear at each other.

1433
00:48:19,115 --> 00:48:20,244
(They swear at each other.)

1434
00:48:20,245 --> 00:48:23,114
- I have an answer. - They can relieve their stress.

1435
00:48:23,115 --> 00:48:25,313
I have an answer. They watch a movie together.

1436
00:48:25,314 --> 00:48:26,384
- I can't think of an answer. - Wait.

1437
00:48:26,385 --> 00:48:27,554
- I have an answer. - I have an answer.

1438
00:48:27,555 --> 00:48:29,083
- I have an answer. - He has an answer.

1439
00:48:29,084 --> 00:48:30,379
- Jae Young? - A horror movie.

1440
00:48:30,484 --> 00:48:31,793
A horror movie?

1441
00:48:31,794 --> 00:48:32,853
(Specifically, watch a horror movie together.)

1442
00:48:32,854 --> 00:48:34,193
- That was quite close. - I have an answer.

1443
00:48:34,194 --> 00:48:35,224
I have an answer.

1444
00:48:35,225 --> 00:48:36,224
They watch a romantic movie.

1445
00:48:36,225 --> 00:48:37,293
A romantic movie.

1446
00:48:37,294 --> 00:48:39,163
(Watching a romantic movie together is correct.)

1447
00:48:39,164 --> 00:48:40,994
- Okay, a romantic movie. - A romantic movie.

1448
00:48:40,995 --> 00:48:42,503
(Based on research, they tend to look for something comforting.)

1449
00:48:42,504 --> 00:48:44,239
- I got it correct. - That's right.

1450
00:48:44,575 --> 00:48:45,574
I did it, Jong Kook.

1451
00:48:45,575 --> 00:48:47,340
- Thank you. - Good job.

1452
00:48:47,405 --> 00:48:48,844
Let's take them our first.

1453
00:48:48,845 --> 00:48:50,574
- I will. - Let's do that.

1454
00:48:50,575 --> 00:48:51,873
They need to be punished.

1455
00:48:51,874 --> 00:48:53,043
Let's not make it obvious.

1456
00:48:53,044 --> 00:48:54,373
- Is this enough? - Seriously.

1457
00:48:54,374 --> 00:48:56,114
You're getting married to me if you pour it in here.

1458
00:48:56,115 --> 00:48:57,543
- Okay, let's do that. - Wait.

1459
00:48:57,544 --> 00:48:59,454
(Let's do that.)

1460
00:48:59,455 --> 00:49:00,784
Okay, let's do that.

1461
00:49:00,785 --> 00:49:01,784
(The bucket promises their marriage.)

1462
00:49:01,785 --> 00:49:03,384
- That's good for me. - I don't want to.

1463
00:49:03,385 --> 00:49:04,523
I don't want to.

1464
00:49:04,524 --> 00:49:05,678
I don't want to.

1465
00:49:06,425 --> 00:49:08,193
- They're almost finished. - They are.

1466
00:49:08,194 --> 00:49:09,393
That team needs to be kept in check too.

1467
00:49:09,394 --> 00:49:11,463
- That team needs to be. - It's okay.

1468
00:49:11,464 --> 00:49:13,034
- It's okay. - Take them out.

1469
00:49:13,035 --> 00:49:14,233
- Hey. - Take them out.

1470
00:49:14,234 --> 00:49:16,503
- Pass a bucket to them. - Pass it to them too.

1471
00:49:16,504 --> 00:49:18,833
- Pass it to them too. - You should do that.

1472
00:49:18,834 --> 00:49:20,074
Let's not do that, everyone.

1473
00:49:20,075 --> 00:49:21,134
Pour it in.

1474
00:49:21,135 --> 00:49:23,244
You're violating our contract.

1475
00:49:23,245 --> 00:49:24,404
- Pour it in. - We got it.

1476
00:49:24,405 --> 00:49:25,744
Okay.

1477
00:49:25,745 --> 00:49:27,813
Pour our last bucket in there.

1478
00:49:27,814 --> 00:49:29,477
Hey, Team Youth.

1479
00:49:29,785 --> 00:49:31,413
- Let's unite. - Of course.

1480
00:49:31,414 --> 00:49:33,554
- Of course. - I've never felt...

1481
00:49:33,555 --> 00:49:34,884
negative towards your team.

1482
00:49:34,885 --> 00:49:36,184
- Okay go on. Unite then. - Unite.

1483
00:49:36,185 --> 00:49:37,753
Go on. We can still get our answers right.

1484
00:49:37,754 --> 00:49:40,101
We are going to get it right. We're relationship experts.

1485
00:49:40,294 --> 00:49:42,232
- Where? Who? - Here.

1486
00:49:43,294 --> 00:49:44,864
(Three dating experts)

1487
00:49:44,865 --> 00:49:45,994
They are here.

1488
00:49:45,995 --> 00:49:48,534
- They received degrees. - Really?

1489
00:49:48,535 --> 00:49:50,233
It hurts my pride that I didn't get anything correct.

1490
00:49:50,234 --> 00:49:53,833
To those who are at the age for marriage,

1491
00:49:53,834 --> 00:49:55,204
listen to this question carefully.

1492
00:49:55,205 --> 00:49:57,550
According to Britain's Daily Mail,

1493
00:49:58,115 --> 00:50:01,143
when both male and female look for their partners,

1494
00:50:01,144 --> 00:50:02,744
they look for those who look like this person.

1495
00:50:02,745 --> 00:50:03,813
- I have an answer. - I have an answer.

1496
00:50:03,814 --> 00:50:05,692
- I have an answer. - My mother.

1497
00:50:05,785 --> 00:50:07,413
- Their parents. - Their parents.

1498
00:50:07,414 --> 00:50:08,454
- Their parents. - Correct.

1499
00:50:08,455 --> 00:50:10,123
(That is the correct answer.)

1500
00:50:10,124 --> 00:50:11,154
(Their partners look like their parents.)

1501
00:50:11,155 --> 00:50:13,195
Finally.

1502
00:50:13,394 --> 00:50:16,193
That question was way too easy.

1503
00:50:16,194 --> 00:50:19,463
If we work together, they're finished.

1504
00:50:19,464 --> 00:50:21,134
We could've finished you before but we chose not to.

1505
00:50:21,135 --> 00:50:22,503
(We could've finished you before but we chose not to.)

1506
00:50:22,504 --> 00:50:24,300
We chose not to finish you.

1507
00:50:24,535 --> 00:50:25,873
Give it to that team.

1508
00:50:25,874 --> 00:50:28,474
- To that team. - Go on.

1509
00:50:28,475 --> 00:50:29,525
(We're going to backstab you guys like what Jae Young did to us.)

1510
00:50:29,705 --> 00:50:31,305
We promised to unite together.

1511
00:50:31,374 --> 00:50:32,574
Wait, no.

1512
00:50:32,575 --> 00:50:35,093
(They break their unification as soon as they unite.)

1513
00:50:35,944 --> 00:50:38,114
(Betrayal always comes back.)

1514
00:50:38,115 --> 00:50:39,613
Good job.

1515
00:50:40,015 --> 00:50:41,784
- Okay. - That's why you can't be nice.

1516
00:50:41,785 --> 00:50:43,254
You'll suffer from it.

1517
00:50:44,024 --> 00:50:45,853
(The second bucket...)

1518
00:50:45,854 --> 00:50:47,654
Let's go.

1519
00:50:47,655 --> 00:50:49,532
(goes to the Team Hello Honey who's known to be kind.)

1520
00:50:50,394 --> 00:50:53,264
Because that team is suspected to have a couple.

1521
00:50:53,265 --> 00:50:54,364
You're right.

1522
00:50:54,365 --> 00:50:56,405
- They're suspicious. - You're right.

1523
00:50:56,834 --> 00:50:59,487
Now you have to keep the promise.

1524
00:50:59,635 --> 00:51:00,934
Okay, everything looks great.

1525
00:51:00,935 --> 00:51:02,781
- Let's do this. - Let's do it.

1526
00:51:02,975 --> 00:51:05,259
This question requires an exact answer.

1527
00:51:05,374 --> 00:51:06,514
I'll be starting.

1528
00:51:06,515 --> 00:51:09,313
According to Professor Robin Dunbar of...

1529
00:51:09,314 --> 00:51:12,083
Evolutionary Psychology of Oxford in the UK,

1530
00:51:12,084 --> 00:51:14,154
people will lose this...

1531
00:51:14,155 --> 00:51:16,571
when they start dating.

1532
00:51:16,685 --> 00:51:18,054
- What is this? - I have an answer.

1533
00:51:18,055 --> 00:51:19,193
(Haha answers.)

1534
00:51:19,194 --> 00:51:20,393
- I have an answer. - It's so obvious.

1535
00:51:20,394 --> 00:51:22,864
(If Team Youth gets it correct, Team Hello Honey might be out.)

1536
00:51:22,865 --> 00:51:24,149
A close friend.

1537
00:51:24,365 --> 00:51:25,364
(Will "A close friend" be the answer?)

1538
00:51:25,365 --> 00:51:26,364
Best friend.

1539
00:51:26,365 --> 00:51:27,594
- Best friend. - Best friend.

1540
00:51:27,595 --> 00:51:28,904
- It has to be more precise. - Your closest friend.

1541
00:51:28,905 --> 00:51:30,733
- Your closest friend. - Best friend.

1542
00:51:30,734 --> 00:51:32,917
(Best friend is correct.)

1543
00:51:33,374 --> 00:51:34,660
(People focus on their partners, they neglect their close friends.)

1544
00:51:35,544 --> 00:51:36,974
- The answer... - That was...

1545
00:51:36,975 --> 00:51:38,744
- Really? - Women are sometimes like that.

1546
00:51:38,745 --> 00:51:40,652
Your team is so smart.

1547
00:51:40,845 --> 00:51:43,784
It is claimed that you'll lose your closest friend.

1548
00:51:43,785 --> 00:51:45,054
- That's quite common. - It is.

1549
00:51:45,055 --> 00:51:46,853
They have a bucket left but we have two left.

1550
00:51:46,854 --> 00:51:48,038
You should finish them quickly.

1551
00:51:48,185 --> 00:51:50,061
It's time for you to finish them.

1552
00:51:50,354 --> 00:51:52,054
- That's right. - We have one bucket left.

1553
00:51:52,055 --> 00:51:53,654
We have to finish them. Otherwise, we'll be at risk.

1554
00:51:53,655 --> 00:51:54,950
- Give it to us. - Firstly...

1555
00:51:55,164 --> 00:51:56,724
- What? - Give it to us.

1556
00:51:56,725 --> 00:51:57,793
(Give it to us.)

1557
00:51:57,794 --> 00:51:59,134
- What? - Give it to us.

1558
00:51:59,135 --> 00:52:00,463
Okay.

1559
00:52:00,464 --> 00:52:01,627
(Immediately)

1560
00:52:02,305 --> 00:52:03,563
(There's no reason not to if you asked for it.)

1561
00:52:03,564 --> 00:52:04,904
Give them a bucket.

1562
00:52:04,905 --> 00:52:06,536
They're finished if they get one more bucket.

1563
00:52:06,774 --> 00:52:08,304
Game is all about power.

1564
00:52:08,305 --> 00:52:10,181
(Think wise)

1565
00:52:10,975 --> 00:52:12,313
(He gets scared.)

1566
00:52:12,314 --> 00:52:14,913
- Hold on. - Kwang Soo.

1567
00:52:14,914 --> 00:52:16,643
Listen. Even after we're finished,

1568
00:52:16,644 --> 00:52:19,062
you need to be able to compete with them.

1569
00:52:19,214 --> 00:52:20,983
Look at the gap between yours and theirs.

1570
00:52:20,984 --> 00:52:22,753
You should give them two buckets.

1571
00:52:22,754 --> 00:52:24,184
You have to keep them in check.

1572
00:52:24,185 --> 00:52:25,393
You need to balance this out.

1573
00:52:25,394 --> 00:52:27,224
- You should've. - You need to balance it.

1574
00:52:27,225 --> 00:52:29,193
One bucket won't make a difference.

1575
00:52:29,194 --> 00:52:30,264
- We have a long way to go. - We have a long way.

1576
00:52:30,265 --> 00:52:31,324
- Wait. - Think carefully.

1577
00:52:31,325 --> 00:52:32,963
- You need to compete with them. - When we are out,

1578
00:52:32,964 --> 00:52:34,563
- you need to compete with them. - The difference is too big.

1579
00:52:34,564 --> 00:52:36,543
- They will win for sure. - That's right.

1580
00:52:37,464 --> 00:52:38,574
(Team Honey Hello seems to be saying the right thing.)

1581
00:52:38,575 --> 00:52:40,503
- You'll be done soon anyway. - It needs to be balanced.

1582
00:52:40,504 --> 00:52:41,974
- Think wise. - But...

1583
00:52:41,975 --> 00:52:44,574
- Should we trust you? - Really.

1584
00:52:44,575 --> 00:52:46,614
- We gave a lot before so... - Seriously.

1585
00:52:46,615 --> 00:52:48,443
- we will accept what you gave us. - Okay.

1586
00:52:48,444 --> 00:52:50,913
Let's make a deal this time. Give it to them.

1587
00:52:50,914 --> 00:52:52,583
- Really. - We will give it to them next time.

1588
00:52:52,584 --> 00:52:53,684
- We promise. - Okay, that's a promise.

1589
00:52:53,685 --> 00:52:55,824
If we win, we will win anyway after giving one bucket away.

1590
00:52:55,825 --> 00:52:57,454
- You'll be finished. - Yes, you will.

1591
00:52:57,455 --> 00:52:58,554
Let's do this.

1592
00:52:58,555 --> 00:52:59,880
We have to do this.

1593
00:52:59,995 --> 00:53:01,324
Let's go against them until the end.

1594
00:53:01,325 --> 00:53:03,994
We're finished anyway if Team Comedians gets it correct this time.

1595
00:53:03,995 --> 00:53:05,566
- Both teams will be done. - You're right.

1596
00:53:05,664 --> 00:53:07,893
If we get it correct this time,

1597
00:53:07,894 --> 00:53:09,563
we can give a bucket each to them.

1598
00:53:09,564 --> 00:53:10,864
Both teams will be finished.

1599
00:53:10,865 --> 00:53:12,574
Let's get it correct. Let's go, Team Honey Hello.

1600
00:53:12,575 --> 00:53:14,674
- We got this. - We just have to try our best.

1601
00:53:14,675 --> 00:53:15,695
Next question.

1602
00:53:15,905 --> 00:53:20,535
According to the National Centre for Biotechnology in the UK,

1603
00:53:20,774 --> 00:53:23,263
couples who have relationships of such...

1604
00:53:24,314 --> 00:53:28,184
gain an average of 2kg a year.

1605
00:53:28,185 --> 00:53:29,377
- I have an answer. - What kind of relationship is this?

1606
00:53:30,155 --> 00:53:31,348
A long distance relationship.

1607
00:53:31,925 --> 00:53:33,486
- This... - I have an answer.

1608
00:53:33,595 --> 00:53:36,482
A happy couple.

1609
00:53:36,694 --> 00:53:38,893
(A happy couple is the correct answer.)

1610
00:53:38,894 --> 00:53:40,063
A happy couple.

1611
00:53:40,064 --> 00:53:42,134
(Seok Jin gets the first and last one right, leading his team to win.)

1612
00:53:42,135 --> 00:53:43,364
It was a happy couple.

1613
00:53:43,365 --> 00:53:45,476
- A happy couple. - A happy couple who are in love.

1614
00:53:45,535 --> 00:53:47,340
- Goodness. - Good job.

1615
00:53:47,475 --> 00:53:48,873
- Let's do this. - Seok Jin.

1616
00:53:48,874 --> 00:53:50,273
- Give them a bucket each. - A bucket each.

1617
00:53:50,274 --> 00:53:51,543
- We need to finish them. - It was about happiness.

1618
00:53:51,544 --> 00:53:52,574
Yes, it was.

1619
00:53:52,575 --> 00:53:54,003
- Happiness. - A happy couple.

1620
00:53:54,144 --> 00:53:55,483
- A couple in love. - Well...

1621
00:53:55,484 --> 00:53:56,543
Goodness.

1622
00:53:56,544 --> 00:53:58,859
- It's going to overflow. - We have no choice.

1623
00:53:59,414 --> 00:54:01,424
- They're finished. - Are they finished?

1624
00:54:01,885 --> 00:54:03,724
Now, for the other team.

1625
00:54:03,725 --> 00:54:05,123
Go to the other team.

1626
00:54:05,124 --> 00:54:06,317
Are they not done yet?

1627
00:54:06,455 --> 00:54:08,094
- Finished. - They're the same,

1628
00:54:08,095 --> 00:54:09,695
(Followed by Team Youth, Team Hello Honey is out too.)

1629
00:54:10,325 --> 00:54:12,864
I have had faith in you now since the first question.

1630
00:54:12,865 --> 00:54:14,733
- I know, right. - Seriously.

1631
00:54:14,734 --> 00:54:17,404
Should we pass over the punishment to the loser through another match?

1632
00:54:17,405 --> 00:54:18,603
Go on.

1633
00:54:18,604 --> 00:54:20,204
- What else can we do? - Let's get it correct.

1634
00:54:20,205 --> 00:54:21,773
- Let's do it. - Let's get it right.

1635
00:54:21,774 --> 00:54:23,131
We have to get it right.

1636
00:54:23,175 --> 00:54:24,806
That'll be two buckets.

1637
00:54:24,975 --> 00:54:26,413
This is...

1638
00:54:26,414 --> 00:54:27,496
That will be too much.

1639
00:54:27,745 --> 00:54:32,054
According to Professor Hazan of Cornell University...

1640
00:54:32,055 --> 00:54:33,713
He has the same alphabet for his surname as me.

1641
00:54:33,714 --> 00:54:35,954
How long does a relationship last before its expiry date?

1642
00:54:35,955 --> 00:54:36,954
- I have an answer. - I have an answer.

1643
00:54:36,955 --> 00:54:38,280
Let me answer.

1644
00:54:38,655 --> 00:54:39,693
What?

1645
00:54:39,694 --> 00:54:40,714
Two years and a half?

1646
00:54:41,225 --> 00:54:42,424
A year and six months.

1647
00:54:42,425 --> 00:54:43,463
I think that's correct.

1648
00:54:43,464 --> 00:54:44,893
- I have an answer. - I have an answer.

1649
00:54:45,435 --> 00:54:46,494
(So Min, an expert of breakup answers.)

1650
00:54:46,495 --> 00:54:48,603
So Min, think about your experience.

1651
00:54:48,604 --> 00:54:49,634
When did you...

1652
00:54:49,635 --> 00:54:51,776
break up with him? When did he...

1653
00:54:52,305 --> 00:54:54,534
(What's wrong with her?)

1654
00:54:54,535 --> 00:54:56,744
What are you doing?

1655
00:54:56,745 --> 00:54:58,514
- I'll answer it. - That was scary.

1656
00:54:58,515 --> 00:54:59,873
- 3, 2... - Come on.

1657
00:54:59,874 --> 00:55:01,373
900 days.

1658
00:55:01,374 --> 00:55:02,711
900 days.

1659
00:55:02,984 --> 00:55:04,313
(Correct)

1660
00:55:04,314 --> 00:55:05,742
Is it 900 days?

1661
00:55:06,714 --> 00:55:09,682
(Goosebumps)

1662
00:55:10,024 --> 00:55:11,412
- Is it 900 days? - Is it for real?

1663
00:55:11,555 --> 00:55:13,324
Did you calculate that?

1664
00:55:13,325 --> 00:55:15,324
- She was calculating it. - Did you?

1665
00:55:15,325 --> 00:55:17,094
I'm getting goosebumps.

1666
00:55:17,095 --> 00:55:18,193
She calculated it.

1667
00:55:18,194 --> 00:55:19,494
No, that's not it.

1668
00:55:19,495 --> 00:55:21,663
I broke up twice after 900 days.

1669
00:55:21,664 --> 00:55:22,864
- Really? - My gosh.

1670
00:55:22,865 --> 00:55:24,976
Anyway, So Min did a good job.

1671
00:55:25,535 --> 00:55:26,860
Your experience helped us.

1672
00:55:27,075 --> 00:55:28,840
She is truly a dating expert.

1673
00:55:29,604 --> 00:55:31,913
That was incredible.

1674
00:55:31,914 --> 00:55:33,443
That was...

1675
00:55:33,444 --> 00:55:35,083
- Let's do this. - Sorry about this.

1676
00:55:35,084 --> 00:55:36,951
1, 2, 3.

1677
00:55:37,615 --> 00:55:40,031
(Splash)

1678
00:55:41,155 --> 00:55:42,175
Wait.

1679
00:55:42,584 --> 00:55:45,043
- Is this for real? - What was that?

1680
00:55:45,495 --> 00:55:47,293
- What was that? - What were you doing?

1681
00:55:47,294 --> 00:55:50,284
I didn't get a drop of it.

1682
00:55:50,325 --> 00:55:52,233
- What were you trying to do? - This is unbelievable.

1683
00:55:52,234 --> 00:55:53,994
- It was too obvious. - Wait, no...

1684
00:55:53,995 --> 00:55:55,503
- It was so heavy. - What did you do?

1685
00:55:55,504 --> 00:55:57,463
Aren't they the couple in real life?

1686
00:55:57,464 --> 00:55:58,904
- Wait. - Ji Hyo.

1687
00:55:58,905 --> 00:56:00,233
- Right. - It was so heavy that...

1688
00:56:00,234 --> 00:56:02,143
- I threw it in the wrong direction. - Okay, let's move on.

1689
00:56:02,144 --> 00:56:03,373
- Seriously. - Okay.

1690
00:56:03,374 --> 00:56:04,474
Okay, next please.

1691
00:56:04,475 --> 00:56:05,844
This is...

1692
00:56:05,845 --> 00:56:07,614
Are they a couple?

1693
00:56:07,615 --> 00:56:09,083
What's up with you and Jong Kook?

1694
00:56:09,084 --> 00:56:11,813
- They seem different. - What's going on?

1695
00:56:11,814 --> 00:56:13,080
Ji Hyo, why did you do that?

1696
00:56:13,155 --> 00:56:14,954
Look at that. Jong Kook looks very happy.

1697
00:56:14,955 --> 00:56:16,054
Listen.

1698
00:56:16,055 --> 00:56:17,684
- Seriously. - I didn't even think about it.

1699
00:56:17,685 --> 00:56:19,324
What was that?

1700
00:56:19,325 --> 00:56:20,523
Hey.

1701
00:56:20,524 --> 00:56:21,523
Don't go so hard.

1702
00:56:21,524 --> 00:56:22,749
Ji Hyo...

1703
00:56:22,925 --> 00:56:24,793
Both of you, that was unfair.

1704
00:56:24,794 --> 00:56:27,063
We need to suspect them. Do you get what I mean?

1705
00:56:27,064 --> 00:56:28,364
We will know after this round.

1706
00:56:28,365 --> 00:56:29,764
- We will be watching you. - Was it on purpose?

1707
00:56:29,765 --> 00:56:31,304
1, 2, 3.

1708
00:56:31,305 --> 00:56:32,702
(If she acts suspicious again, they're definitely a secret couple.)

1709
00:56:32,975 --> 00:56:34,056
What?

1710
00:56:34,435 --> 00:56:35,771
What are you doing?

1711
00:56:37,544 --> 00:56:39,114
(That seemed so suspicious.)

1712
00:56:39,115 --> 00:56:41,273
Wait. You should try holding this.

1713
00:56:41,274 --> 00:56:43,284
Does it make sense that Ji Hyo can't do this?

1714
00:56:43,285 --> 00:56:44,884
- I'm being serious. - Ji Hyo.

1715
00:56:44,885 --> 00:56:46,353
- I'm being serious. - That was too obvious.

1716
00:56:46,354 --> 00:56:47,583
- That was so unfair. - Try it yourself.

1717
00:56:47,584 --> 00:56:49,424
Okay then.

1718
00:56:49,425 --> 00:56:51,384
What kind of punishment is that?

1719
00:56:51,385 --> 00:56:53,094
Okay, we will ask for a hint.

1720
00:56:53,095 --> 00:56:55,193
Only one of the four of you come and get the hint.

1721
00:56:55,194 --> 00:56:56,193
I'll go.

1722
00:56:56,194 --> 00:56:57,793
Why would you go?

1723
00:56:57,794 --> 00:56:59,936
(I'll go then.)

1724
00:57:00,595 --> 00:57:02,777
- Let's make this fair. - Rock, scissors and paper.

1725
00:57:02,905 --> 00:57:04,163
Rock, scissors, paper.

1726
00:57:04,164 --> 00:57:06,204
(The result)

1727
00:57:06,205 --> 00:57:07,204
(Hee Jin is chosen.)

1728
00:57:07,205 --> 00:57:08,233
- I knew it. - I knew it.

1729
00:57:08,234 --> 00:57:09,344
Unbelievable.

1730
00:57:09,345 --> 00:57:10,974
- Gosh. - How did that happen?

1731
00:57:10,975 --> 00:57:11,974
I chose scissors.

1732
00:57:11,975 --> 00:57:13,273
That's annoying.

1733
00:57:13,274 --> 00:57:15,413
- That seems weird. - I don't understand...

1734
00:57:15,414 --> 00:57:16,643
- Hee Jin. - Yes?

1735
00:57:16,644 --> 00:57:18,413
- Let's share the hint. - We should.

1736
00:57:18,414 --> 00:57:20,114
- Hee Jin, you should check and... - Yes?

1737
00:57:20,115 --> 00:57:21,753
- I don't want to. - Do you not want to?

1738
00:57:21,754 --> 00:57:23,424
- "I don't want to" - I like that.

1739
00:57:23,425 --> 00:57:24,955
- I like the way she said. - She doesn't want to.

1740
00:57:25,095 --> 00:57:27,154
Here are the hints for the secret couple and the relationship virgin.

1741
00:57:27,155 --> 00:57:28,419
- You can choose one. - Look at her mouth.

1742
00:57:29,095 --> 00:57:31,063
If she picks the hint for the relationship virgin,

1743
00:57:31,064 --> 00:57:32,931
she's definitely one of the secret couple.

1744
00:57:33,365 --> 00:57:35,242
- He said "relationship virgin". - He did.

1745
00:57:35,504 --> 00:57:37,103
- Did she say "relationship virgin"? - I heard she said "virgin".

1746
00:57:37,104 --> 00:57:39,003
- I did hear "relationship". - I heard "virgin".

1747
00:57:39,004 --> 00:57:40,603
- I only heard that. - Yes.

1748
00:57:40,604 --> 00:57:42,443
- Right? - She mouthed "relationship virgin".

1749
00:57:42,444 --> 00:57:44,474
- I heard "virgin". - She should share it with us.

1750
00:57:44,475 --> 00:57:45,674
Hee Jin.

1751
00:57:45,675 --> 00:57:47,713
If you don't share it with us, you're the secret couple.

1752
00:57:47,714 --> 00:57:48,913
That makes sense.

1753
00:57:48,914 --> 00:57:51,244
- Hee Jin, share it with us. - Okay.

1754
00:57:51,245 --> 00:57:53,583
People will think you are the secret couple otherwise.

1755
00:57:53,584 --> 00:57:54,784
- The secret couple. - That's right.

1756
00:57:54,785 --> 00:57:56,559
- What? - You will be suspected.

1757
00:57:56,685 --> 00:57:57,954
- Come on. - I don't want to share it.

1758
00:57:57,955 --> 00:57:59,523
(She refuses to share the hint.)

1759
00:57:59,524 --> 00:58:01,253
I heard "Relationship virgin".

1760
00:58:01,254 --> 00:58:02,523
Okay.

1761
00:58:02,524 --> 00:58:03,824
She is the secret couple.

1762
00:58:03,825 --> 00:58:06,140
While you were solving the quiz,

1763
00:58:06,334 --> 00:58:09,497
the secret couple succeeded in the secret mission.

1764
00:58:09,734 --> 00:58:10,733
Really?

1765
00:58:10,734 --> 00:58:12,641
(The secret couple succeeded in the secret mission.)

1766
00:58:13,774 --> 00:58:15,376
With this suspicion,

1767
00:58:15,805 --> 00:58:17,508
- you'll move to the next location. - Okay.

1768
00:58:19,575 --> 00:58:21,349
I didn't know there is a school here.

1769
00:58:21,374 --> 00:58:23,587
The next mission is...

1770
00:58:23,785 --> 00:58:25,483
the Roulette of Fate.

1771
00:58:25,484 --> 00:58:26,884
(The Roulette of Fate)

1772
00:58:26,885 --> 00:58:27,954
What is that?

1773
00:58:27,955 --> 00:58:29,583
- Roulette? - Roulette?

1774
00:58:29,584 --> 00:58:32,094
Now, you will play a three-way tug-of-war...

1775
00:58:32,095 --> 00:58:34,523
with students.

1776
00:58:34,524 --> 00:58:37,163
(A three-way tug-of-war with students)

1777
00:58:37,164 --> 00:58:38,215
Tug-of-war...

1778
00:58:38,694 --> 00:58:39,693
(Recruit students and play a large-scale tug-of-war.)

1779
00:58:39,694 --> 00:58:43,641
Recruit students in a limited amount of time.

1780
00:58:43,805 --> 00:58:46,404
The more students you recruit, the more advantageous you will be.

1781
00:58:46,405 --> 00:58:48,720
(The team that rings the bell first wins.)

1782
00:58:49,075 --> 00:58:50,674
You can only recruit students...

1783
00:58:50,675 --> 00:58:53,043
who complete the mission.

1784
00:58:53,044 --> 00:58:54,043
(You can only recruit students who complete the mission.)

1785
00:58:54,044 --> 00:58:56,635
The mission will be chosen by the roulette.

1786
00:58:56,785 --> 00:58:58,344
- Okay. - However,

1787
00:58:58,345 --> 00:59:01,414
every team needs one student from a specific major.

1788
00:59:01,885 --> 00:59:04,684
- Musical major. Modeling major. - Military science major?

1789
00:59:04,685 --> 00:59:06,424
- Military science major. - Military science major.

1790
00:59:06,425 --> 00:59:07,793
You need at least one student from your designated major.

1791
00:59:07,794 --> 00:59:09,523
Other than that one student, we can recruit...

1792
00:59:09,524 --> 00:59:11,054
- as many students as we want. - The major doesn't matter.

1793
00:59:11,564 --> 00:59:13,333
- One student. - You can only recruit students...

1794
00:59:13,334 --> 00:59:14,634
who complete the mission.

1795
00:59:14,635 --> 00:59:16,804
- Let's go. - Okay.

1796
00:59:16,805 --> 00:59:18,103
- Let's go. - Let's go.

1797
00:59:18,104 --> 00:59:19,273
(Where are the students of designated majors?)

1798
00:59:19,274 --> 00:59:20,603
- Military science. - Military science.

1799
00:59:20,604 --> 00:59:22,614
- Military science. - Where is the department?

1800
00:59:22,874 --> 00:59:24,574
Where is the department?

1801
00:59:24,575 --> 00:59:25,873
Where is the department of military science?

1802
00:59:25,874 --> 00:59:27,043
- Military science. - Military science.

1803
00:59:27,044 --> 00:59:29,184
- Hello. - Hello.

1804
00:59:29,185 --> 00:59:31,443
(Running Man, salute!)

1805
00:59:31,444 --> 00:59:32,514
- Hello. - Are you a military science major?

1806
00:59:32,515 --> 00:59:34,013
- Yes, I am. - We found one!

1807
00:59:34,584 --> 00:59:36,684
(Team Comedians finds a military science major.)

1808
00:59:36,685 --> 00:59:38,454
- You are a military science major. - A military science major.

1809
00:59:38,455 --> 00:59:40,094
- Let's go. - Hello.

1810
00:59:40,095 --> 00:59:41,353
Is he really a military science major?

1811
00:59:41,354 --> 00:59:43,563
Military science majors wear a uniform.

1812
00:59:43,564 --> 00:59:45,063
- Really? - Yes.

1813
00:59:45,064 --> 00:59:46,693
Where is the department? Is it inside?

1814
00:59:46,694 --> 00:59:49,063
- Everyone is in the dormitory. - Are there a lot of them?

1815
00:59:49,064 --> 00:59:50,563
- Let's go. - Let's go.

1816
00:59:50,564 --> 00:59:52,103
- This is incredible. - Let's go.

1817
00:59:52,104 --> 00:59:54,503
- How did we get so lucky? - Is there a dormitory inside?

1818
00:59:54,504 --> 00:59:57,228
Yes, the first years must live in the dormitory.

1819
00:59:57,675 --> 00:59:59,474
- I see. - It took us no time.

1820
00:59:59,475 --> 01:00:00,773
It's here.

1821
01:00:00,774 --> 01:00:02,784
- This is the dormitory. - I can't believe it.

1822
01:00:02,785 --> 01:00:04,083
This is the department of military science.

1823
01:00:04,084 --> 01:00:06,154
- We met a student right away. - This is the best.

1824
01:00:06,155 --> 01:00:08,583
- It's this building. - Hey, beanpole!

1825
01:00:08,584 --> 01:00:10,324
(Kwang Soo, you must be jealous.)

1826
01:00:10,325 --> 01:00:12,160
The department of military science.

1827
01:00:12,595 --> 01:00:14,533
- Why is it so close? - It's in the separate building.

1828
01:00:14,794 --> 01:00:16,424
Where are the musical majors?

1829
01:00:16,425 --> 01:00:17,563
(It's their designated major.)

1830
01:00:17,564 --> 01:00:19,634
- Where... - This hill is so steep.

1831
01:00:19,635 --> 01:00:21,693
- Lee Kwang Soo is handsome! - Lee Kwang Soo is handsome!

1832
01:00:21,694 --> 01:00:24,463
(The students are generous.)

1833
01:00:24,464 --> 01:00:27,637
(Gosh, girls are following me.)

1834
01:00:28,604 --> 01:00:34,713
(Even the girls would be taken aback by his fake fan service.)

1835
01:00:34,714 --> 01:00:36,983
They love it.

1836
01:00:36,984 --> 01:00:38,616
(Fans, thank you always.)

1837
01:00:38,885 --> 01:00:41,884
(Is this a giraffe or a man?)

1838
01:00:41,885 --> 01:00:45,526
(He acts like he is in a young adult drama.)

1839
01:00:45,995 --> 01:00:48,054
- This is exhausting. - It's that way.

1840
01:00:48,055 --> 01:00:49,563
There is a scuba diving club.

1841
01:00:49,564 --> 01:00:50,693
That's cool.

1842
01:00:50,694 --> 01:00:52,470
- What is that? - Are they musical majors?

1843
01:00:52,794 --> 01:00:54,121
- Military science majors? - I think they are musical majors!

1844
01:00:54,564 --> 01:00:57,264
- Musical majors! - I think she is right.

1845
01:00:57,265 --> 01:00:59,474
Musical majors! Are you musical majors?

1846
01:00:59,475 --> 01:01:00,674
It's written on their backs.

1847
01:01:00,675 --> 01:01:02,074
- Musical majors. - They are musical majors.

1848
01:01:02,075 --> 01:01:03,404
Are you musical majors?

1849
01:01:03,405 --> 01:01:05,006
(They find a group of students.)

1850
01:01:05,314 --> 01:01:06,873
- Musical majors! - Are you musical majors?

1851
01:01:06,874 --> 01:01:08,721
- Come with us! - Are you serious?

1852
01:01:08,814 --> 01:01:10,043
They are here.

1853
01:01:10,044 --> 01:01:11,413
They are musical majors.

1854
01:01:11,414 --> 01:01:12,454
(They run into musical majors in the schoolyard.)

1855
01:01:12,455 --> 01:01:14,353
We need all of them.

1856
01:01:14,354 --> 01:01:15,623
- Hold on. - Are all of you musical majors?

1857
01:01:15,624 --> 01:01:17,083
- Yes! - Yes!

1858
01:01:17,084 --> 01:01:18,184
(They have a loud voice and a cheerful spirit.)

1859
01:01:18,185 --> 01:01:19,480
(Welcome, Running Man.)

1860
01:01:19,694 --> 01:01:23,061
Do you happen to be free? We need to play tug-of-war.

1861
01:01:23,064 --> 01:01:24,494
Yes!

1862
01:01:24,495 --> 01:01:25,585
(We are totally free!)

1863
01:01:26,495 --> 01:01:28,094
- There is a mission. - If you complete the mission...

1864
01:01:28,095 --> 01:01:30,482
- Then you can come with us. - Okay.

1865
01:01:31,205 --> 01:01:33,174
Since we picked modeling major,

1866
01:01:33,175 --> 01:01:34,633
let's go to the department of modeling.

1867
01:01:34,834 --> 01:01:36,508
- My goodness. - This is fascinating.

1868
01:01:36,675 --> 01:01:38,244
Maybe we can learn how to walk.

1869
01:01:38,245 --> 01:01:39,468
Let's go.

1870
01:01:39,714 --> 01:01:41,313
Why are there no students?

1871
01:01:41,314 --> 01:01:42,684
This is the department of modeling.

1872
01:01:42,685 --> 01:01:43,884
Let's go. Let's go.

1873
01:01:43,885 --> 01:01:46,638
- My goodness. - My goodness, this is...

1874
01:01:47,254 --> 01:01:48,274
My goodness.

1875
01:01:49,084 --> 01:01:50,784
Hello, this is...

1876
01:01:50,785 --> 01:01:53,623
- Hello. - They don't disappoint.

1877
01:01:53,624 --> 01:01:55,523
- They are tall. - I need to be on my tiptoes.

1878
01:01:55,524 --> 01:01:57,024
They are so tall.

1879
01:01:57,095 --> 01:01:58,869
- Hello. - Hello.

1880
01:01:59,495 --> 01:02:02,434
We need your help to complete...

1881
01:02:02,435 --> 01:02:04,270
the mission.

1882
01:02:05,405 --> 01:02:06,404
(We would love to help.)

1883
01:02:06,405 --> 01:02:08,503
It looks like you were practicing.

1884
01:02:08,504 --> 01:02:10,136
It looks like you were practicing for the runway.

1885
01:02:11,004 --> 01:02:12,983
We were practicing our walk.

1886
01:02:13,044 --> 01:02:15,443
Would you show us your walk?

1887
01:02:15,444 --> 01:02:16,583
(We want to see modeling majors' walk.)

1888
01:02:16,584 --> 01:02:18,114
That came out of nowhere.

1889
01:02:18,385 --> 01:02:20,154
We are curious.

1890
01:02:20,155 --> 01:02:22,083
(I will show you.)

1891
01:02:22,084 --> 01:02:23,787
(His stage manners are the best.)

1892
01:02:24,885 --> 01:02:26,690
He must be an ace.

1893
01:02:27,194 --> 01:02:28,582
He must be an ace.

1894
01:02:29,464 --> 01:02:33,094
(How good will be the walk of the confident ace?)

1895
01:02:33,095 --> 01:02:35,236
(He looks like a model.)

1896
01:02:36,365 --> 01:02:39,003
(He walks down the runway with his long legs.)

1897
01:02:39,004 --> 01:02:40,331
He is cool.

1898
01:02:40,635 --> 01:02:42,277
He is an ace.

1899
01:02:42,874 --> 01:02:44,074
He is handsome.

1900
01:02:44,075 --> 01:02:45,471
(The ace is chic.)

1901
01:02:46,675 --> 01:02:48,276
(Hs is the ace.)

1902
01:02:48,675 --> 01:02:50,684
Who else wants to go?

1903
01:02:50,685 --> 01:02:52,884
Here comes another one.

1904
01:02:52,885 --> 01:02:55,684
Here comes another one. My goodness.

1905
01:02:55,685 --> 01:02:58,384
(He has an impressive walk and a chic facial expression.)

1906
01:02:58,385 --> 01:03:00,027
(He has stage manners.)

1907
01:03:00,925 --> 01:03:02,933
Who else wants to go?

1908
01:03:04,064 --> 01:03:07,534
- Jae Young was a model. - He was a model.

1909
01:03:07,535 --> 01:03:09,543
(He is a senior model!)

1910
01:03:09,905 --> 01:03:11,364
Check out the senior model's walk.

1911
01:03:11,365 --> 01:03:12,704
- Senior model! - Walk down the runway.

1912
01:03:12,705 --> 01:03:14,204
- Senior model! - Show us.

1913
01:03:14,205 --> 01:03:16,142
- Senior model! - Music, please.

1914
01:03:16,345 --> 01:03:17,344
It has been years.

1915
01:03:17,345 --> 01:03:19,773
- Senior model! - Senior model!

1916
01:03:19,774 --> 01:03:21,916
- Senior model! - Here he comes.

1917
01:03:22,385 --> 01:03:23,567
Come on out.

1918
01:03:25,285 --> 01:03:26,983
(His steps are seasoned.)

1919
01:03:26,984 --> 01:03:30,697
(Your senior model is here.)

1920
01:03:31,124 --> 01:03:35,439
(He is as cool as he was on the runway.)

1921
01:03:36,265 --> 01:03:37,963
(He shows his talent.)

1922
01:03:37,964 --> 01:03:39,259
You are good!

1923
01:03:39,794 --> 01:03:42,463
(A senior model sure is different.)

1924
01:03:42,464 --> 01:03:44,035
You are cool!

1925
01:03:45,435 --> 01:03:48,034
(Walking powerfully)

1926
01:03:48,035 --> 01:03:49,273
For goodness' sake.

1927
01:03:49,274 --> 01:03:50,273
(For goodness' sake.)

1928
01:03:50,274 --> 01:03:51,804
(He becomes embarrassed.)

1929
01:03:51,805 --> 01:03:53,674
I am sorry.

1930
01:03:53,675 --> 01:03:56,642
It's okay. You are cool.

1931
01:03:56,814 --> 01:03:58,443
It has been years.

1932
01:03:58,444 --> 01:04:00,884
I am seeing a lot of beautiful people here.

1933
01:04:00,885 --> 01:04:03,083
- To be honest, our mission is... - It requires strength.

1934
01:04:03,084 --> 01:04:04,889
tug-of-war.

1935
01:04:05,185 --> 01:04:07,092
As soon as I walked in, I saw him.

1936
01:04:07,794 --> 01:04:10,344
(Burly)

1937
01:04:11,524 --> 01:04:12,893
(His big build is perfect for tug-of-war.)

1938
01:04:12,894 --> 01:04:14,087
Seriously.

1939
01:04:14,194 --> 01:04:16,833
He is so big. Is he a model?

1940
01:04:16,834 --> 01:04:18,977
What kind of model are you?

1941
01:04:19,175 --> 01:04:20,674
- I am a sports model. - I see.

1942
01:04:20,675 --> 01:04:22,603
That makes sense. I knew you weren't...

1943
01:04:22,604 --> 01:04:24,304
- a regular model. - He has a big build.

1944
01:04:24,305 --> 01:04:26,181
How broad are your shoulders?

1945
01:04:26,874 --> 01:04:28,713
- Your shoulders are so broad. - Seriously.

1946
01:04:28,714 --> 01:04:31,614
We have a mission. It won't be hard.

1947
01:04:31,615 --> 01:04:33,954
Please help us out.

1948
01:04:33,955 --> 01:04:36,623
(They can only recruit students who complete the chosen mission.)

1949
01:04:36,624 --> 01:04:38,824
Please spin it.

1950
01:04:38,825 --> 01:04:42,058
In 1, 2, 3. Okay. That's good.

1951
01:04:42,995 --> 01:04:44,264
"Fizzy Drink's Dignity".

1952
01:04:44,265 --> 01:04:46,407
(Fizzy Drink's Dignity)

1953
01:04:47,064 --> 01:04:49,603
(One member and a student will down a fizzy drink.)

1954
01:04:49,604 --> 01:04:51,904
(The mission is a success if they don't burp for 5 seconds.)

1955
01:04:51,905 --> 01:04:53,773
Since you work out, you wouldn't have fizzy drinks.

1956
01:04:53,774 --> 01:04:55,579
- I like them. - Really?

1957
01:04:55,975 --> 01:04:57,804
(He loves fizzy drinks.)

1958
01:04:57,805 --> 01:04:59,987
That was unexpected. He likes them.

1959
01:05:00,245 --> 01:05:02,143
Now... Okay.

1960
01:05:02,144 --> 01:05:03,884
- Don't be nervous. - Okay.

1961
01:05:03,885 --> 01:05:04,884
Drink slowly.

1962
01:05:04,885 --> 01:05:07,403
Otherwise, it might get caught in your throat.

1963
01:05:07,555 --> 01:05:09,523
- Drink slowly. - Drink slowly.

1964
01:05:09,524 --> 01:05:10,984
Get ready.

1965
01:05:11,524 --> 01:05:13,623
- Set. - Drink slowly.

1966
01:05:13,624 --> 01:05:14,676
Go.

1967
01:05:15,225 --> 01:05:18,050
Drink slowly. It's okay.

1968
01:05:18,624 --> 01:05:20,893
Since he is really big,

1969
01:05:20,894 --> 01:05:23,281
drinking a can of Coca-Cola won't be a problem.

1970
01:05:23,834 --> 01:05:25,712
We picked the perfect one.

1971
01:05:26,705 --> 01:05:27,827
Slowly.

1972
01:05:28,035 --> 01:05:29,043
He is fast.

1973
01:05:29,044 --> 01:05:31,421
- Check the can. - Are you done?

1974
01:05:32,774 --> 01:05:33,873
(He feels the fizz.)

1975
01:05:33,874 --> 01:05:36,087
- 3, 4, - It's okay.

1976
01:05:36,785 --> 01:05:38,543
- five. - Okay.

1977
01:05:38,544 --> 01:05:39,983
(He succeeded in holding it in.)

1978
01:05:39,984 --> 01:05:41,789
He did it.

1979
01:05:42,185 --> 01:05:43,583
- One, - I don't burp.

1980
01:05:43,584 --> 01:05:45,940
2, 3,

1981
01:05:46,555 --> 01:05:48,595
4, 5.

1982
01:05:48,624 --> 01:05:49,623
Okay.

1983
01:05:49,624 --> 01:05:50,724
(They succeed in recruiting 1 modeling major.)

1984
01:05:50,725 --> 01:05:51,994
(That was close.)

1985
01:05:51,995 --> 01:05:53,595
He said he doesn't burp.

1986
01:05:53,834 --> 01:05:55,804
(He can go and play tug-of-war.)

1987
01:05:55,805 --> 01:05:57,191
He said he doesn't burp.

1988
01:05:57,334 --> 01:05:58,974
- That's utter nonsense. - His lips...

1989
01:05:58,975 --> 01:06:01,503
- were trembling. - All right. Thank you.

1990
01:06:01,504 --> 01:06:02,543
- Thank you. - Thank you.

1991
01:06:02,544 --> 01:06:05,024
- It was nice to meet you. - Thank you.

1992
01:06:05,504 --> 01:06:07,713
- Everyone... - Hold on.

1993
01:06:07,714 --> 01:06:08,766
All right.

1994
01:06:09,584 --> 01:06:11,656
(Hold on. Don't go!)

1995
01:06:11,745 --> 01:06:13,184
(A student volunteers for the second mission.)

1996
01:06:13,185 --> 01:06:15,623
You should have come out sooner.

1997
01:06:15,624 --> 01:06:17,454
We don't know which mission you will get.

1998
01:06:17,455 --> 01:06:19,094
Spin it. In 1, 2, 3.

1999
01:06:19,095 --> 01:06:21,893
(What will be the second mission?)

2000
01:06:21,894 --> 01:06:23,527
From Feet to Waist.

2001
01:06:24,865 --> 01:06:28,264
(Using your lower body only, pull up a band on your ankles...)

2002
01:06:28,265 --> 01:06:30,682
(to your waist in 1 minute.)

2003
01:06:31,035 --> 01:06:32,474
You are so tall. How tall are you?

2004
01:06:32,475 --> 01:06:34,168
- I am 191cm tall. - 191cm tall?

2005
01:06:34,475 --> 01:06:35,674
He is as tall as Kwang Soo.

2006
01:06:35,675 --> 01:06:36,726
He is my role model.

2007
01:06:37,544 --> 01:06:39,244
(He wants to be a model-turned-actor who gets mistaken for a comedian.)

2008
01:06:39,245 --> 01:06:40,335
Kwang Soo is?

2009
01:06:40,975 --> 01:06:43,043
You resemble Kwang Soo.

2010
01:06:43,044 --> 01:06:44,813
My nickname has always been Lee Kwang Soo.

2011
01:06:44,814 --> 01:06:45,978
(Is it a good thing or a bad thing?)

2012
01:06:46,685 --> 01:06:49,184
People like him are strong.

2013
01:06:49,185 --> 01:06:50,384
- Let's go. - Let's go.

2014
01:06:50,385 --> 01:06:51,405
Get ready.

2015
01:06:51,624 --> 01:06:53,429
Set, go.

2016
01:06:53,455 --> 01:06:55,963
That's good. That's good.

2017
01:06:55,964 --> 01:06:58,364
(The band goes up fast thanks to his long legs.)

2018
01:06:58,365 --> 01:07:01,150
He is good. He really resembles Kwang Soo.

2019
01:07:01,435 --> 01:07:02,995
- It's on my waist. - It needs to go up higher.

2020
01:07:03,104 --> 01:07:04,563
(The band stops at his hips.)

2021
01:07:04,564 --> 01:07:06,174
- What should I do? - Roll on the floor.

2022
01:07:06,175 --> 01:07:07,534
Roll on the floor.

2023
01:07:07,535 --> 01:07:09,238
Come here. Come this way.

2024
01:07:09,444 --> 01:07:10,773
There you go. Use friction.

2025
01:07:10,774 --> 01:07:12,074
- Okay. - 10 seconds remain.

2026
01:07:12,075 --> 01:07:13,614
This is hard.

2027
01:07:13,615 --> 01:07:15,983
(Struggling)

2028
01:07:15,984 --> 01:07:17,943
- Is it not working? - Use the edge of the desk.

2029
01:07:17,944 --> 01:07:19,382
- Use the edge. - Use the edge.

2030
01:07:19,615 --> 01:07:20,684
(He tries to drag it up.)

2031
01:07:20,685 --> 01:07:22,929
That's good. The edge will do the trick.

2032
01:07:22,984 --> 01:07:25,850
- Hold on. Get it in your buttcrack. - 3, 2,

2033
01:07:25,995 --> 01:07:27,623
- Get it in your buttcrack. - one.

2034
01:07:27,624 --> 01:07:29,793
- Your buttcrack. - You did it!

2035
01:07:29,794 --> 01:07:31,063
(The band goes up at the last moment.)

2036
01:07:31,064 --> 01:07:33,063
You did it. It went up. It went up a lot.

2037
01:07:33,064 --> 01:07:34,393
- Count that as a success. - Seriously.

2038
01:07:34,394 --> 01:07:35,833
- It went up to the waist. - Count that as a success.

2039
01:07:35,834 --> 01:07:37,204
Count that as a success.

2040
01:07:37,205 --> 01:07:39,174
- He has short legs. - We will count it as a success.

2041
01:07:39,175 --> 01:07:40,664
- Okay. - Yes!

2042
01:07:41,705 --> 01:07:45,074
You did it. That was great.

2043
01:07:45,075 --> 01:07:46,543
You need to have that spirit.

2044
01:07:46,544 --> 01:07:48,656
It was nice to meet everyone. Thank you.

2045
01:07:49,444 --> 01:07:51,244
I hear some guys' voices.

2046
01:07:51,245 --> 01:07:52,437
(Team Comedians visits military science department.)

2047
01:07:52,685 --> 01:07:53,837
Hello.

2048
01:07:54,115 --> 01:07:56,572
- Hello, excuse us. - Hello.

2049
01:07:57,425 --> 01:07:58,623
(Military science students welcome them.)

2050
01:07:58,624 --> 01:08:00,052
- Goodness. - Hello.

2051
01:08:00,694 --> 01:08:02,358
- That's right. - Excuse us.

2052
01:08:02,694 --> 01:08:03,888
Let us take a moment.

2053
01:08:04,164 --> 01:08:06,102
We're shooting Running Man.

2054
01:08:06,194 --> 01:08:09,775
We need people to play tug-of-war with us.

2055
01:08:09,834 --> 01:08:11,663
Could you help us?

2056
01:08:11,664 --> 01:08:13,408
- Yes. - Yes.

2057
01:08:13,475 --> 01:08:15,474
Their voices are strong and loud.

2058
01:08:15,475 --> 01:08:16,525
All of them look...

2059
01:08:16,575 --> 01:08:18,143
- so strong. - They look strong.

2060
01:08:18,144 --> 01:08:19,614
Some of them are sturdy.

2061
01:08:19,615 --> 01:08:20,838
- They must be strong. - Jae Seok.

2062
01:08:20,874 --> 01:08:22,684
- Seriously. - Here's one.

2063
01:08:22,685 --> 01:08:24,581
He looks burly.

2064
01:08:24,685 --> 01:08:26,353
We need him.

2065
01:08:26,354 --> 01:08:30,554
(He checks his arm muscles.)

2066
01:08:30,555 --> 01:08:32,554
Seok Jin, we just met them.

2067
01:08:32,555 --> 01:08:33,645
So what?

2068
01:08:34,095 --> 01:08:35,823
What if we meet for the first time?

2069
01:08:35,824 --> 01:08:37,150
We just met...

2070
01:08:38,494 --> 01:08:39,586
By the way,

2071
01:08:39,635 --> 01:08:40,788
Seok Jin.

2072
01:08:41,964 --> 01:08:43,203
Seok Jin.

2073
01:08:43,204 --> 01:08:45,134
(His way of saying hello is physical.)

2074
01:08:45,135 --> 01:08:46,502
- Seok Jin... - I was testing him.

2075
01:08:46,504 --> 01:08:47,903
works out these days.

2076
01:08:47,904 --> 01:08:50,274
He tries to play arm wrestling whenever he meets someone.

2077
01:08:50,275 --> 01:08:51,373
It's to test the strength.

2078
01:08:51,374 --> 01:08:52,444
We need strong people.

2079
01:08:52,445 --> 01:08:54,713
- We'll spin the roulette. - Go ahead.

2080
01:08:54,714 --> 01:08:56,111
Let's spin it.

2081
01:08:56,185 --> 01:08:57,283
All right.

2082
01:08:57,284 --> 01:08:58,283
(What will be Team Comedians' first mission?)

2083
01:08:58,284 --> 01:08:59,354
- "Mouth gag"? - Mouth gag.

2084
01:08:59,355 --> 01:09:01,083
- It's Gag Speed Quiz. - Gag Speed Quiz.

2085
01:09:01,084 --> 01:09:02,452
(Gag Speed Quiz)

2086
01:09:03,084 --> 01:09:05,384
(Pass on a keyword with a gag and earplugs on.)

2087
01:09:05,385 --> 01:09:07,854
(They must get 6 or more keywords correct within 1 minute.)

2088
01:09:07,855 --> 01:09:08,854
(Success)

2089
01:09:08,855 --> 01:09:11,343
This is rarely used.

2090
01:09:11,794 --> 01:09:14,064
Except on variety shows,

2091
01:09:14,065 --> 01:09:16,757
- we don't get to use it. - No one uses it.

2092
01:09:16,805 --> 01:09:17,885
All right.

2093
01:09:18,204 --> 01:09:19,604
It's strange to wear it outside.

2094
01:09:19,605 --> 01:09:21,778
- Let's go. - Let's go.

2095
01:09:21,935 --> 01:09:23,128
- Let's go. - Let's go.

2096
01:09:23,845 --> 01:09:24,998
Please turn around.

2097
01:09:25,044 --> 01:09:26,344
Tap and turn around.

2098
01:09:26,345 --> 01:09:27,413
(Hee Jin answers, and Seok Jin gives keywords.)

2099
01:09:27,414 --> 01:09:29,107
Get ready.

2100
01:09:29,185 --> 01:09:31,514
(Sizzling)

2101
01:09:31,515 --> 01:09:33,187
"Sizzling".

2102
01:09:33,784 --> 01:09:35,213
"Sizzling".

2103
01:09:35,214 --> 01:09:37,366
(He hears the keyword.)

2104
01:09:37,725 --> 01:09:38,878
We don't have much time.

2105
01:09:39,254 --> 01:09:41,424
- "Gargling". - "Gargling"?

2106
01:09:41,425 --> 01:09:42,894
(He easily understands.)

2107
01:09:42,895 --> 01:09:44,016
"Sizzling".

2108
01:09:44,294 --> 01:09:45,385
Here it comes.

2109
01:09:45,425 --> 01:09:46,556
That was great.

2110
01:09:47,534 --> 01:09:48,694
Here it comes.

2111
01:09:48,695 --> 01:09:49,903
"Sizzling".

2112
01:09:49,904 --> 01:09:51,292
- "Sizzling". - Correct.

2113
01:09:52,065 --> 01:09:53,174
(They get 1 correct.)

2114
01:09:53,175 --> 01:09:54,807
That was great.

2115
01:09:54,975 --> 01:09:57,274
(They must get 5 more correct to succeed.)

2116
01:09:57,275 --> 01:09:59,814
"Gurgling".

2117
01:09:59,815 --> 01:10:01,202
(I got it.)

2118
01:10:02,275 --> 01:10:03,644
"Gurgling".

2119
01:10:03,645 --> 01:10:07,153
(What is he saying?)

2120
01:10:07,485 --> 01:10:09,046
That student, Joon Soo, is the problem.

2121
01:10:10,824 --> 01:10:13,554
(Thankfully, he understood the correct word.)

2122
01:10:13,555 --> 01:10:15,123
(It's a bit worrisome.)

2123
01:10:15,124 --> 01:10:18,424
"Gurgling".

2124
01:10:18,425 --> 01:10:21,094
"Sliding"?

2125
01:10:21,095 --> 01:10:22,833
(The second answer is wrong.)

2126
01:10:22,834 --> 01:10:24,058
Please, Joon Soo!

2127
01:10:24,404 --> 01:10:26,617
(I'll do better this time.)

2128
01:10:26,904 --> 01:10:28,503
"Crawling".

2129
01:10:28,504 --> 01:10:29,698
(It sounded accurate.)

2130
01:10:30,374 --> 01:10:33,404
"Smile radiantly".

2131
01:10:33,775 --> 01:10:35,040
Joon Soo!

2132
01:10:35,445 --> 01:10:37,963
(Joon Soo gets it wrong again.)

2133
01:10:38,815 --> 01:10:40,113
(He understands the correct keyword.)

2134
01:10:40,114 --> 01:10:41,283
"Crawling".

2135
01:10:41,284 --> 01:10:42,884
(It's interesting.)

2136
01:10:42,885 --> 01:10:44,618
- "Crawling". - Okay.

2137
01:10:45,154 --> 01:10:46,424
(They have 30 seconds left.)

2138
01:10:46,425 --> 01:10:47,955
Okay, you did well, Joon Soo.

2139
01:10:48,254 --> 01:10:49,323
(Get 4 more correct.)

2140
01:10:49,324 --> 01:10:50,344
We don't have time.

2141
01:10:50,794 --> 01:10:51,823
(Colorful)

2142
01:10:51,824 --> 01:10:53,194
(Sticking out his tongue)

2143
01:10:53,195 --> 01:10:55,064
"Colorful".

2144
01:10:55,065 --> 01:10:58,125
(His pronunciation is accurate, but his face is wrong.)

2145
01:10:58,765 --> 01:11:00,978
(They're shocked by his look.)

2146
01:11:01,404 --> 01:11:04,159
(I understand what it is.)

2147
01:11:04,404 --> 01:11:08,087
(Joon Soo says, "Flare up".)

2148
01:11:08,775 --> 01:11:11,089
(Please, Joon Soo!)

2149
01:11:11,914 --> 01:11:15,934
(Interestingly enough, he says the correct keyword.)

2150
01:11:16,824 --> 01:11:18,054
"Here and there"?

2151
01:11:18,055 --> 01:11:19,728
(The answer becomes wrong again.)

2152
01:11:20,754 --> 01:11:24,875
(What is he saying? They got this one wrong.)

2153
01:11:26,034 --> 01:11:27,134
What?

2154
01:11:27,135 --> 01:11:28,194
"Colorful"?

2155
01:11:28,195 --> 01:11:29,938
(Her answer is correct.)

2156
01:11:30,565 --> 01:11:31,703
That's amazing.

2157
01:11:31,704 --> 01:11:33,470
- What happened? - That was good. Keep going.

2158
01:11:34,504 --> 01:11:35,873
- What happened? - All right.

2159
01:11:35,874 --> 01:11:37,003
(They only have 20 seconds.)

2160
01:11:37,004 --> 01:11:38,127
(Gulping)

2161
01:11:38,445 --> 01:11:39,844
"Gulping".

2162
01:11:39,845 --> 01:11:41,474
(They must answer 3 more correct.)

2163
01:11:41,475 --> 01:11:42,943
"Gulping".

2164
01:11:43,714 --> 01:11:45,958
(They pass on the word accurately and quickly.)

2165
01:11:46,114 --> 01:11:48,022
"Gulping".

2166
01:11:48,084 --> 01:11:49,184
(They answer 4 correct.)

2167
01:11:49,185 --> 01:11:50,554
Answer two more.

2168
01:11:50,555 --> 01:11:52,694
(They must get 2 more correct in 15 seconds.)

2169
01:11:52,695 --> 01:11:54,594
- We need two more. - "Shivering".

2170
01:11:54,595 --> 01:11:55,694
(He also makes a movement.)

2171
01:11:55,695 --> 01:11:57,193
- We need two more. - "Shivering".

2172
01:11:57,395 --> 01:12:00,993
(Joon Soo passes it on accurately.)

2173
01:12:00,994 --> 01:12:02,194
"Daseul, daseul"?

2174
01:12:02,195 --> 01:12:03,434
(However it's wrong.)

2175
01:12:03,435 --> 01:12:06,234
("Shivering" turns into something incomprehensible.)

2176
01:12:06,235 --> 01:12:09,243
("Shivering" turns into something incomprehensible.)

2177
01:12:09,244 --> 01:12:11,104
(Will Hee Jin answer correctly?)

2178
01:12:11,105 --> 01:12:12,226
"Shivering"?

2179
01:12:13,044 --> 01:12:14,543
- "Daseul, daseul"? - "Shivering"?

2180
01:12:14,544 --> 01:12:15,814
(She's an expert at interpreting words through gags.)

2181
01:12:15,815 --> 01:12:16,936
What's going on?

2182
01:12:17,445 --> 01:12:18,536
How did you answer correctly?

2183
01:12:19,044 --> 01:12:20,884
(They need to answer 1 more in 7 seconds.)

2184
01:12:20,885 --> 01:12:21,905
Hurry up.

2185
01:12:21,914 --> 01:12:23,485
- What is it? - Here it comes.

2186
01:12:23,555 --> 01:12:24,583
"Panting and puffing".

2187
01:12:24,584 --> 01:12:27,854
(They immediately fail if there's an accident in passing on.)

2188
01:12:27,855 --> 01:12:29,048
"Panting and puffing".

2189
01:12:30,324 --> 01:12:31,594
It's the last one.

2190
01:12:31,595 --> 01:12:34,194
(If they answer correctly, they can invite 3 of them.)

2191
01:12:34,195 --> 01:12:35,387
"Panting and puffing".

2192
01:12:35,964 --> 01:12:37,003
"Panting and puffing".

2193
01:12:37,004 --> 01:12:38,863
(Her answer is correct.)

2194
01:12:38,864 --> 01:12:41,455
(They win Gag Speed Quiz.)

2195
01:12:42,074 --> 01:12:43,543
(They invite 3 students from the military science department.)

2196
01:12:43,544 --> 01:12:44,543
Good job.

2197
01:12:44,544 --> 01:12:46,483
(Team Comedians has recruited them.)

2198
01:12:46,914 --> 01:12:48,844
Can we take all of them? That's good.

2199
01:12:48,845 --> 01:12:50,844
- We got it. - The two work well together.

2200
01:12:50,845 --> 01:12:51,913
Goodness.

2201
01:12:51,914 --> 01:12:53,184
He kept making mistakes.

2202
01:12:53,185 --> 01:12:54,314
Seriously.

2203
01:12:54,315 --> 01:12:56,222
He made mistakes several times.

2204
01:12:56,284 --> 01:12:57,753
- Goodness. - Though he made mistakes,

2205
01:12:57,754 --> 01:12:59,050
she answered correctly.

2206
01:12:59,284 --> 01:13:00,694
We got three students.

2207
01:13:00,695 --> 01:13:01,924
- It's a success. - Success.

2208
01:13:01,925 --> 01:13:03,424
(After many ups and downs,)

2209
01:13:03,425 --> 01:13:04,995
(they finish recruiting military science majors.)

2210
01:13:06,095 --> 01:13:07,869
Only those who succeed can come with us.

2211
01:13:07,895 --> 01:13:09,064
We don't have time.

2212
01:13:09,065 --> 01:13:10,934
- Hurry. - We don't have time.

2213
01:13:10,935 --> 01:13:12,064
Who wants to go?

2214
01:13:12,065 --> 01:13:13,234
Come out if you're strong.

2215
01:13:13,235 --> 01:13:14,333
(Everyone who is strong should come out.)

2216
01:13:14,334 --> 01:13:15,763
One of you should come.

2217
01:13:16,374 --> 01:13:17,503
That's great.

2218
01:13:17,504 --> 01:13:19,004
(I want to go.)

2219
01:13:19,145 --> 01:13:21,286
Come this way.

2220
01:13:21,744 --> 01:13:22,944
Stand here for now.

2221
01:13:22,945 --> 01:13:24,107
- Spin it. - Spin it hard.

2222
01:13:25,015 --> 01:13:28,953
(Which mission will Team Youth get?)

2223
01:13:28,954 --> 01:13:30,280
"From Feet to Waist."

2224
01:13:31,685 --> 01:13:33,123
(They must raise the band from the ankles to the waist.)

2225
01:13:33,124 --> 01:13:34,451
It'll be better to take off your coat.

2226
01:13:34,855 --> 01:13:35,953
You can do it.

2227
01:13:35,954 --> 01:13:37,094
Be careful around the bottom.

2228
01:13:37,095 --> 01:13:39,064
- You can do it. - Okay, okay.

2229
01:13:39,164 --> 01:13:40,970
Start.

2230
01:13:41,364 --> 01:13:43,914
- Raise it up. - Raise it up.

2231
01:13:44,565 --> 01:13:46,203
- She's fast. - That's good.

2232
01:13:46,204 --> 01:13:47,373
You're doing well.

2233
01:13:47,374 --> 01:13:49,037
You're doing well.

2234
01:13:49,074 --> 01:13:50,330
That's great.

2235
01:13:50,805 --> 01:13:53,043
(Her dancing can be seen in her flexibility.)

2236
01:13:53,044 --> 01:13:54,708
- She's fast. - That's good.

2237
01:13:55,114 --> 01:13:56,307
Hurry.

2238
01:13:56,985 --> 01:13:58,106
It got stuck.

2239
01:13:58,914 --> 01:14:00,913
Please, please.

2240
01:14:00,914 --> 01:14:02,314
Please raise it up.

2241
01:14:02,315 --> 01:14:04,018
- I can't help you. - Raise it up.

2242
01:14:04,425 --> 01:14:05,547
I'm sorry.

2243
01:14:05,624 --> 01:14:06,848
I'm sorry.

2244
01:14:07,855 --> 01:14:10,394
- What is he doing? - You're doing well.

2245
01:14:10,395 --> 01:14:11,394
(My bottom is so annoying.)

2246
01:14:11,395 --> 01:14:13,764
- What's going on? - Haha.

2247
01:14:13,765 --> 01:14:14,963
- I got it. - Here you go, Haha.

2248
01:14:14,964 --> 01:14:16,291
- Please. - Use my foot.

2249
01:14:16,565 --> 01:14:17,604
Please.

2250
01:14:17,605 --> 01:14:19,474
(I'll raise it by hooking it around foot.)

2251
01:14:19,475 --> 01:14:21,412
- I got it. - Did you get it?

2252
01:14:21,775 --> 01:14:23,903
(This is it. Try it like this.)

2253
01:14:23,904 --> 01:14:25,073
Put out your foot for her.

2254
01:14:25,074 --> 01:14:26,441
Use her foot.

2255
01:14:26,744 --> 01:14:27,873
Use her foot.

2256
01:14:27,874 --> 01:14:29,583
(She uses Bona's foot as a stand.)

2257
01:14:29,584 --> 01:14:31,184
- You have 10 seconds. - 10 seconds.

2258
01:14:31,185 --> 01:14:32,644
Please, please.

2259
01:14:32,645 --> 01:14:34,814
(Struggling)

2260
01:14:34,815 --> 01:14:35,977
Be careful.

2261
01:14:36,584 --> 01:14:37,924
(Something hurts her.)

2262
01:14:37,925 --> 01:14:38,984
Hold on.

2263
01:14:38,985 --> 01:14:40,823
She said she would do it on her own.

2264
01:14:40,824 --> 01:14:43,594
(I'm sorry for what happened in front of the camera.)

2265
01:14:43,595 --> 01:14:45,462
She said she would do it on her own.

2266
01:14:45,824 --> 01:14:47,033
Do it yourself.

2267
01:14:47,034 --> 01:14:48,157
(It gets through.)

2268
01:14:48,735 --> 01:14:50,304
(She succeeds with a strange movement.)

2269
01:14:50,305 --> 01:14:51,903
It's a success.

2270
01:14:51,904 --> 01:14:53,833
- I'm sorry, I'm sorry. - It's okay.

2271
01:14:53,834 --> 01:14:55,234
I didn't mean it.

2272
01:14:55,235 --> 01:14:56,397
I'm sorry.

2273
01:14:56,544 --> 01:14:59,774
Bona, apologize to her. You only met her a moment ago.

2274
01:14:59,775 --> 01:15:01,873
(He feels very apologetic.)

2275
01:15:01,874 --> 01:15:03,043
Apologize.

2276
01:15:03,044 --> 01:15:04,384
- Apologize to her. - It's okay.

2277
01:15:04,385 --> 01:15:05,466
I'm sorry.

2278
01:15:05,685 --> 01:15:06,854
(The whole team bows to apologize.)

2279
01:15:06,855 --> 01:15:08,283
I'm very sorry.

2280
01:15:08,284 --> 01:15:09,653
No, it's okay.

2281
01:15:09,654 --> 01:15:11,052
Thank you.

2282
01:15:11,385 --> 01:15:13,253
Here it is.

2283
01:15:13,254 --> 01:15:14,323
(Another student gets ready to go.)

2284
01:15:14,324 --> 01:15:16,424
(Goodness)

2285
01:15:16,425 --> 01:15:18,505
This is very difficult.

2286
01:15:19,635 --> 01:15:21,434
(Something goes wrong during the mission.)

2287
01:15:21,435 --> 01:15:22,634
I'm sorry.

2288
01:15:22,635 --> 01:15:24,634
- I'm sorry. - Are you okay?

2289
01:15:24,635 --> 01:15:25,934
- Are you okay? - She sat down.

2290
01:15:25,935 --> 01:15:27,025
She sat down.

2291
01:15:27,074 --> 01:15:28,403
- I'm sorry. - It's okay.

2292
01:15:28,404 --> 01:15:30,174
Will you be okay? I'm sorry.

2293
01:15:30,175 --> 01:15:31,297
(The student wouldn't have known she'd show slapstick at school.)

2294
01:15:31,975 --> 01:15:32,974
(I'm sorry and thank you.)

2295
01:15:32,975 --> 01:15:34,953
- Did we succeed, didn't we? - Shall I go?

2296
01:15:35,175 --> 01:15:36,265
You go first.

2297
01:15:37,044 --> 01:15:38,884
- You can do it. - You can do it.

2298
01:15:38,885 --> 01:15:40,384
(Succeed and join us for tug-of-war.)

2299
01:15:40,385 --> 01:15:43,005
Let's go. Come with us.

2300
01:15:43,225 --> 01:15:44,959
Get ready.

2301
01:15:45,055 --> 01:15:46,105
Get ready.

2302
01:15:46,754 --> 01:15:48,632
Start.

2303
01:15:48,695 --> 01:15:50,163
- Keep going. - They're good.

2304
01:15:50,164 --> 01:15:51,216
(The time limit is 1 minute.)

2305
01:15:52,195 --> 01:15:55,694
(His long legs are useful for times like this.)

2306
01:15:55,695 --> 01:15:56,903
That's good.

2307
01:15:56,904 --> 01:15:59,974
(He uses his legs to raise the band.)

2308
01:15:59,975 --> 01:16:01,128
That's good.

2309
01:16:01,635 --> 01:16:03,674
- Is this it? - Put your bottoms together.

2310
01:16:03,675 --> 01:16:05,174
(He gives useful advice.)

2311
01:16:05,175 --> 01:16:06,243
(They get to it.)

2312
01:16:06,244 --> 01:16:07,413
Put your bottoms together.

2313
01:16:07,414 --> 01:16:09,894
(They put them together.)

2314
01:16:10,315 --> 01:16:12,613
(The contact of their bottoms seems mysterious.)

2315
01:16:12,614 --> 01:16:14,654
(It probably needs to be blurred.)

2316
01:16:14,784 --> 01:16:16,253
(What is going on?)

2317
01:16:16,254 --> 01:16:17,815
No.

2318
01:16:18,324 --> 01:16:20,059
Hook it if it doesn't work.

2319
01:16:20,525 --> 01:16:21,594
Hook it.

2320
01:16:21,595 --> 01:16:22,753
(He gives support with his foot.)

2321
01:16:22,754 --> 01:16:24,151
(Pulling up)

2322
01:16:24,664 --> 01:16:25,924
(He successfully raises the band.)

2323
01:16:25,925 --> 01:16:27,118
Hook it for Kwang Soo.

2324
01:16:27,334 --> 01:16:28,734
(I'll raise yours too.)

2325
01:16:28,735 --> 01:16:30,570
(Pushing)

2326
01:16:31,305 --> 01:16:34,203
(There's another accident.)

2327
01:16:34,204 --> 01:16:35,397
It's not done yet.

2328
01:16:36,775 --> 01:16:39,152
(They're speechless.)

2329
01:16:40,515 --> 01:16:41,913
It's gross.

2330
01:16:41,914 --> 01:16:43,113
(I'll do it properly.)

2331
01:16:43,114 --> 01:16:44,267
Your time is up.

2332
01:16:44,485 --> 01:16:46,854
- He got it. This is safe. - Good job.

2333
01:16:46,855 --> 01:16:47,984
We'll accept it.

2334
01:16:47,985 --> 01:16:49,443
(One more musical major succeeds.)

2335
01:16:50,725 --> 01:16:51,984
Thank goodness that you didn't fail.

2336
01:16:51,985 --> 01:16:53,554
- He was amazing. - He worked hard.

2337
01:16:53,555 --> 01:16:54,823
He did such a good job.

2338
01:16:54,824 --> 01:16:56,564
I was startled by how good you were.

2339
01:16:56,565 --> 01:16:58,095
(Team Youth recruits 2 students.)

2340
01:16:58,864 --> 01:17:01,077
From Feet to Waist.

2341
01:17:01,895 --> 01:17:02,985
Seung Woo is...

2342
01:17:03,105 --> 01:17:04,833
burly too.

2343
01:17:04,834 --> 01:17:07,674
(Se Chan plays with a military science student.)

2344
01:17:07,675 --> 01:17:09,134
Get ready.

2345
01:17:09,305 --> 01:17:10,426
Get ready.

2346
01:17:10,945 --> 01:17:12,025
Start.

2347
01:17:12,445 --> 01:17:13,597
- Move a lot. - That's right.

2348
01:17:13,945 --> 01:17:15,713
(They move their legs quickly.)

2349
01:17:15,714 --> 01:17:16,868
That's right.

2350
01:17:16,945 --> 01:17:18,617
- Raise it. - That's right.

2351
01:17:18,714 --> 01:17:20,551
- He got it. - Yes.

2352
01:17:21,055 --> 01:17:22,613
That's right. You're doing well.

2353
01:17:22,614 --> 01:17:25,032
That's good.

2354
01:17:25,124 --> 01:17:27,024
That's it. That's it.

2355
01:17:27,025 --> 01:17:28,932
(He twists fiercely.)

2356
01:17:28,994 --> 01:17:30,117
That's it.

2357
01:17:30,765 --> 01:17:32,123
- Hook it. - That's good.

2358
01:17:32,124 --> 01:17:33,293
(He uses the doorknob.)

2359
01:17:33,294 --> 01:17:34,662
You almost got it.

2360
01:17:34,735 --> 01:17:36,134
- Hook it. - You almost got it.

2361
01:17:36,135 --> 01:17:37,934
(Seung Woo becomes silent all of a sudden.)

2362
01:17:37,935 --> 01:17:39,566
Goodness. Your pants...

2363
01:17:39,874 --> 01:17:40,997
Time out.

2364
01:17:41,034 --> 01:17:42,636
Wait, his pants...

2365
01:17:42,834 --> 01:17:44,681
Seung Woo.

2366
01:17:44,904 --> 01:17:46,073
Are you okay?

2367
01:17:46,074 --> 01:17:48,930
(The back of his pants is open.)

2368
01:17:49,244 --> 01:17:50,844
This is not how to do it.

2369
01:17:50,845 --> 01:17:52,996
(His pants burst open due to his fierce twisting.)

2370
01:17:53,485 --> 01:17:54,713
Seung Woo.

2371
01:17:54,714 --> 01:17:55,837
Are you okay?

2372
01:17:55,954 --> 01:17:57,210
His pants...

2373
01:17:57,954 --> 01:18:01,524
(Comrade, you fought bravely.)

2374
01:18:01,754 --> 01:18:03,024
I'm sorry.

2375
01:18:03,025 --> 01:18:05,094
(The mission is stopped.)

2376
01:18:05,095 --> 01:18:07,104
(Poor student)

2377
01:18:07,364 --> 01:18:09,134
- I heard a loud noise. - Oh, no.

2378
01:18:09,135 --> 01:18:10,163
(He testifies it right away.)

2379
01:18:10,164 --> 01:18:12,934
We'll accept it as a success.

2380
01:18:12,935 --> 01:18:14,174
(His efforts are considered a success.)

2381
01:18:14,175 --> 01:18:15,604
You did a good job.

2382
01:18:15,605 --> 01:18:16,930
(Thank you.)

2383
01:18:17,074 --> 01:18:19,104
- Are you okay, Seung Woo? - Thank you.

2384
01:18:19,105 --> 01:18:20,573
Let's do it.

2385
01:18:20,574 --> 01:18:23,384
(They pick the last mission.)

2386
01:18:23,385 --> 01:18:24,771
- "Master of Facial Expression". - "Master of Facial Expression".

2387
01:18:24,815 --> 01:18:25,936
It's Master of Facial Expression.

2388
01:18:26,885 --> 01:18:30,684
(By using facial muscles, take off 10 sticky notes...)

2389
01:18:30,685 --> 01:18:32,323
(within one minute.)

2390
01:18:32,324 --> 01:18:34,753
- Master of Facial Expression. - I'll try.

2391
01:18:34,754 --> 01:18:36,394
(Someone volunteers.)

2392
01:18:36,395 --> 01:18:37,792
- That's good. - Come out.

2393
01:18:38,265 --> 01:18:39,524
- Play, Hee Jin. - Hee Jin.

2394
01:18:39,525 --> 01:18:40,734
Go, Hee Jin.

2395
01:18:40,735 --> 01:18:42,907
- Jang Hee Jin. - Let's go.

2396
01:18:43,464 --> 01:18:45,474
(Okay, I'll try.)

2397
01:18:45,864 --> 01:18:47,976
(They stick 10 sticky notes.)

2398
01:18:48,874 --> 01:18:50,444
His face is oily.

2399
01:18:50,445 --> 01:18:52,804
(This student's face is oily.)

2400
01:18:52,805 --> 01:18:54,743
When I stick it, it falls off.

2401
01:18:54,744 --> 01:18:56,444
They'll fall off easily.

2402
01:18:56,445 --> 01:18:58,213
The more oily his face is, the better it is.

2403
01:18:58,214 --> 01:18:59,713
(Is this a good thing?)

2404
01:18:59,714 --> 01:19:00,884
All right.

2405
01:19:00,885 --> 01:19:02,453
Here we go. Get ready.

2406
01:19:02,454 --> 01:19:04,253
- Get ready. - Start.

2407
01:19:04,254 --> 01:19:05,323
(The time limit is 1 minute.)

2408
01:19:05,324 --> 01:19:06,783
Make facial expressions.

2409
01:19:07,355 --> 01:19:10,024
(The sticky notes fall off easily as soon as he starts.)

2410
01:19:10,025 --> 01:19:11,524
- That's it. - That's good.

2411
01:19:11,525 --> 01:19:13,694
Make facial expressions.

2412
01:19:13,695 --> 01:19:15,493
Make a face. That's good.

2413
01:19:15,494 --> 01:19:16,764
You're doing well.

2414
01:19:16,765 --> 01:19:19,589
That's good. Use facial muscles.

2415
01:19:20,435 --> 01:19:22,174
Yes, frown your face. That's good.

2416
01:19:22,175 --> 01:19:23,531
- You're doing well. - Hee Jin.

2417
01:19:23,744 --> 01:19:25,377
Hee Jin, Hee Jin.

2418
01:19:27,145 --> 01:19:29,174
(She shakes her head violently.)

2419
01:19:29,175 --> 01:19:30,613
Seong Hwan.

2420
01:19:30,614 --> 01:19:32,413
- Seong Hwan. - Shake it.

2421
01:19:32,414 --> 01:19:33,913
Shake it and throw your head back.

2422
01:19:33,914 --> 01:19:36,484
(It must be the most difficult task he's ever had at school.)

2423
01:19:36,485 --> 01:19:40,094
(Take it off, comrade.)

2424
01:19:40,095 --> 01:19:41,349
- It's not working. - Kim Seong Hwan.

2425
01:19:41,754 --> 01:19:42,924
- They only have one. - Shake it.

2426
01:19:42,925 --> 01:19:44,264
No, I got it.

2427
01:19:44,265 --> 01:19:45,493
I got it.

2428
01:19:45,494 --> 01:19:47,333
- She got it. Next is Seong Hwan. - She got it.

2429
01:19:47,334 --> 01:19:48,694
- Seong Hwan. - Seong Hwan.

2430
01:19:48,695 --> 01:19:50,463
- I got it. - You have one left.

2431
01:19:50,464 --> 01:19:51,804
- Hurry. - You have one left.

2432
01:19:51,805 --> 01:19:53,533
- Hurry. - It's the last one.

2433
01:19:53,534 --> 01:19:55,203
- Only one left! - Let's go.

2434
01:19:55,204 --> 01:19:56,444
Wink.

2435
01:19:56,445 --> 01:19:57,804
Wink.

2436
01:19:57,805 --> 01:20:00,174
- Kim Seong Hwan. - Let's go.

2437
01:20:00,175 --> 01:20:01,571
- Kim Seong Hwan. - He got it.

2438
01:20:02,044 --> 01:20:03,444
(They blow on it.)

2439
01:20:03,445 --> 01:20:04,607
It's not working.

2440
01:20:04,815 --> 01:20:06,713
Go easy on him now.

2441
01:20:06,714 --> 01:20:08,014
I'm dizzy.

2442
01:20:08,015 --> 01:20:10,854
(He gives up.)

2443
01:20:10,855 --> 01:20:12,424
(He fails after shaking too much.)

2444
01:20:12,425 --> 01:20:14,872
- Goodness. - That was so close.

2445
01:20:15,225 --> 01:20:18,064
(You still did a good job.)

2446
01:20:18,065 --> 01:20:20,889
- Why was it completely stuck? - It wouldn't come off.

2447
01:20:21,534 --> 01:20:23,064
You worked hard, Seong Hwan.

2448
01:20:23,065 --> 01:20:24,463
Good job.

2449
01:20:24,464 --> 01:20:26,035
(They fail to recruit 1 more student.)

2450
01:20:26,404 --> 01:20:27,934
(Each team finishes recruiting students.)

2451
01:20:27,935 --> 01:20:29,200
Let's check...

2452
01:20:29,404 --> 01:20:32,404
the number of members on each team.

2453
01:20:32,475 --> 01:20:35,636
