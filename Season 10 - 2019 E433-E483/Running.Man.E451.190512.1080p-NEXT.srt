1
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,529
(The scents from flowers are heightened on this spring day.)

2
00:00:08,530 --> 00:00:10,477
- Hello. - Hi.

3
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:12,024
Hello.

4
00:00:12,840 --> 00:00:14,338
- Good morning. - Hi.

5
00:00:14,339 --> 00:00:16,859
All right. Please move back. You're too close.

6
00:00:16,940 --> 00:00:18,078
- You look aggressive. - Okay.

7
00:00:18,079 --> 00:00:19,978
- Right. I'm a bit excited. - You flustered me.

8
00:00:19,979 --> 00:00:21,008
We're starting separately today.

9
00:00:21,009 --> 00:00:22,713
- Yes. Everyone starts separately. - Okay.

10
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:25,532
- It's an individual race today. - It's an individual race.

11
00:00:26,049 --> 00:00:28,249
We prepared today's special episode...

12
00:00:28,250 --> 00:00:30,719
to celebrate the Great Teacher of Korea,

13
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:31,918
Sejong the Great.

14
00:00:31,919 --> 00:00:33,317
It's a special episode for the Teachers' Day.

15
00:00:33,389 --> 00:00:35,634
It's Sejong the Great's Riddle Race.

16
00:00:36,230 --> 00:00:37,559
Is that so?

17
00:00:37,560 --> 00:00:39,028
How is Sejong the Great relevant to the race?

18
00:00:39,029 --> 00:00:40,928
In 1965,

19
00:00:40,929 --> 00:00:44,234
we decided to celebrate Teachers' Day on May 15...

20
00:00:44,370 --> 00:00:47,009
- which was the king's birthday. - His birthday was on May 15.

21
00:00:47,010 --> 00:00:48,309
- Is that so? - Yes.

22
00:00:48,310 --> 00:00:49,439
Teachers' Day?

23
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:50,439
(The rules will be announced in light of his birthday.)

24
00:00:50,440 --> 00:00:54,108
In the final round, you will solve a riddle about Sejong the Great.

25
00:00:54,109 --> 00:00:56,418
The member that survives will win the race...

26
00:00:56,419 --> 00:00:58,278
and win the cash prize.

27
00:00:58,279 --> 00:00:59,370
My gosh.

28
00:00:59,450 --> 00:01:01,019
You will be able to win...

29
00:01:01,020 --> 00:01:03,918
Chance Cards at mission spots by accomplishing the missions...

30
00:01:03,919 --> 00:01:05,458
before anyone else.

31
00:01:05,459 --> 00:01:07,329
Chance Cards? Okay.

32
00:01:07,330 --> 00:01:08,629
Four spots for the Chance Cards...

33
00:01:08,630 --> 00:01:11,046
- are labeled by keywords. - Thank you.

34
00:01:11,159 --> 00:01:13,569
"Four Best Chance Cards. Choose a keyword from below..."

35
00:01:13,570 --> 00:01:15,028
"and move to the designated places."

36
00:01:15,029 --> 00:01:16,774
"Science, War, Korean Alphabets, and 10 Dollars".

37
00:01:17,439 --> 00:01:21,346
However, if you're the only one at the mission spot,

38
00:01:21,639 --> 00:01:24,039
you'll receive the Chance Card upon arrival.

39
00:01:24,040 --> 00:01:26,078
However, if there are other members at the mission spot,

40
00:01:26,079 --> 00:01:28,908
you'll have a match, and the member who wins the match...

41
00:01:28,909 --> 00:01:30,582
will only receive the Chance Card.

42
00:01:31,249 --> 00:01:32,518
It's about the mind game. I see.

43
00:01:32,519 --> 00:01:34,426
- If I'm alone, it's a guarantee. - Yes.

44
00:01:34,719 --> 00:01:37,989
I'm sure a lot of people will choose the Korean Alphabets or 10 Dollars.

45
00:01:37,990 --> 00:01:39,213
(Lady Luck thinks those two will be popular.)

46
00:01:39,359 --> 00:01:40,961
I bet a lot of people will go here.

47
00:01:41,529 --> 00:01:44,519
Money, money, money. Gosh, money.

48
00:01:44,900 --> 00:01:45,899
As for War...

49
00:01:45,900 --> 00:01:47,929
(Let's see which member will be compatible.)

50
00:01:47,930 --> 00:01:49,168
It's Jong Kook's.

51
00:01:49,169 --> 00:01:50,668
(He's the king when it comes to war.)

52
00:01:50,669 --> 00:01:51,791
I should...

53
00:01:51,939 --> 00:01:53,039
choose War.

54
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:54,569
(That's why he goes with War.)

55
00:01:54,570 --> 00:01:56,479
I will go and participate in a war.

56
00:01:56,480 --> 00:01:57,662
Just like that?

57
00:01:58,510 --> 00:02:00,141
I'm not supposed to make a quick decision?

58
00:02:00,249 --> 00:02:03,778
I'll get in the car and feel people out first.

59
00:02:03,779 --> 00:02:04,918
(Everyone heads to the mission spots.)

60
00:02:04,919 --> 00:02:06,786
The keyword, War, grabbed my eyes.

61
00:02:07,219 --> 00:02:10,351
All right. Let's call to find out where they'll be going to.

62
00:02:11,859 --> 00:02:12,888
(Whom will Se Chan call first?)

63
00:02:12,889 --> 00:02:13,929
Hey, punk.

64
00:02:13,930 --> 00:02:16,329
(It's Jong Kook, the most powerful member on the show.)

65
00:02:16,330 --> 00:02:20,307
(There's a man who loves you to the bits)

66
00:02:20,430 --> 00:02:22,265
- Hello, Jong Kook. - Hey.

67
00:02:22,330 --> 00:02:24,739
- Hey, which one will you pick? - Yes?

68
00:02:24,740 --> 00:02:27,831
Doesn't one of the keywords remind you of me?

69
00:02:28,170 --> 00:02:30,408
Remind of you? Is it War?

70
00:02:30,409 --> 00:02:31,408
(Suddenly, there's a riddle to solve.)

71
00:02:31,409 --> 00:02:32,408
(That's correct!)

72
00:02:32,409 --> 00:02:33,709
You'll go with War?

73
00:02:33,710 --> 00:02:35,179
I ought to go for War.

74
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:37,519
Whoever comes, there will be a war.

75
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:39,222
I chose the same keyword.

76
00:02:39,819 --> 00:02:43,019
I guess I'm destined to be crushed by you today.

77
00:02:43,020 --> 00:02:44,919
- Right. - Okay.

78
00:02:44,920 --> 00:02:47,133
If you try to survive, you'll die.

79
00:02:47,529 --> 00:02:49,929
- Okay. - If you try to die, you'll survive.

80
00:02:49,930 --> 00:02:50,929
(Come if you can handle me.)

81
00:02:50,930 --> 00:02:53,028
Jong Kook, I'll call you later.

82
00:02:53,029 --> 00:02:54,763
- See you later. - Okay, Jong Kook.

83
00:02:55,629 --> 00:02:57,985
My goodness, Se Chan.

84
00:03:00,110 --> 00:03:01,739
(Since I already checked on the strongest guy...)

85
00:03:01,740 --> 00:03:03,438
I should call the weakling of the weaklings.

86
00:03:03,439 --> 00:03:04,530
(I should call the weakling of the weaklings.)

87
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:07,709
- Hey, Se Chan. - Hey, Seok Jin.

88
00:03:07,710 --> 00:03:10,079
- Hey. - Where are you?

89
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:13,353
Don't be a sly rat, and tell me where you're going.

90
00:03:13,420 --> 00:03:16,072
I already talked to Jong Kook earlier.

91
00:03:16,319 --> 00:03:18,089
He said he's definitely going to the spot for Science.

92
00:03:18,090 --> 00:03:20,288
(Actually, he'll be heading to the spot for War.)

93
00:03:20,289 --> 00:03:22,258
(Se Chan gives him false information.)

94
00:03:22,259 --> 00:03:24,329
(Will Seok Jin fall for it?)

95
00:03:24,330 --> 00:03:26,829
If he said that, he'll go by all means.

96
00:03:26,830 --> 00:03:27,829
(His instincts are too weak.)

97
00:03:27,830 --> 00:03:29,899
Exactly. He said he's going there for sure.

98
00:03:29,900 --> 00:03:31,799
With that said, the only member...

99
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:34,639
I can easily beat is you.

100
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:35,839
(He's brutally honest.)

101
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:38,288
- Hey. Do you want to fight me? - I'll go up against you.

102
00:03:39,249 --> 00:03:41,209
- Hey. I might just crush you. - I want to go up against you.

103
00:03:41,210 --> 00:03:43,902
What about 10 Dollars? Meet me at the spot for 10 Dollars.

104
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:46,288
- Are you really going there? - I'm serious.

105
00:03:46,289 --> 00:03:47,619
I'm already on my way there.

106
00:03:47,620 --> 00:03:49,905
Seok Jin, wait for me. I'll be on my way.

107
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:51,491
- Okay. - Okay.

108
00:03:54,289 --> 00:03:56,359
Sir, please drive me to the spot for War.

109
00:03:56,360 --> 00:03:59,198
(He fell for Se Chan's trick.)

110
00:03:59,199 --> 00:04:00,628
(After getting tricked by Se Chan, at the spot for the War...)

111
00:04:00,629 --> 00:04:03,597
I suit the keyword well. It'll be war everywhere.

112
00:04:03,999 --> 00:04:06,080
I don't care if he comes or not. Someone is calling.

113
00:04:06,610 --> 00:04:07,908
(This strong guy's phone is ringing off the hook.)

114
00:04:07,909 --> 00:04:09,715
- Hey, Kwang Soo. - Hello.

115
00:04:09,909 --> 00:04:11,267
I chose War.

116
00:04:12,110 --> 00:04:13,248
It's been a while.

117
00:04:13,249 --> 00:04:14,549
I see. Jong Kook.

118
00:04:14,550 --> 00:04:15,549
(If you chose War...)

119
00:04:15,550 --> 00:04:16,919
Then, I can only choose from...

120
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:19,806
Science, Korean Alphabets, and 10 Dollars.

121
00:04:20,289 --> 00:04:21,443
Okay.

122
00:04:21,520 --> 00:04:23,719
When you say you'll do something, you follow through.

123
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:25,219
Of course. I'm on my way.

124
00:04:25,220 --> 00:04:27,929
Okay. Then, I decided to go to the spot for 10 Dollars.

125
00:04:27,930 --> 00:04:30,559
Yes, the keyword suits you well. It's totally you.

126
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:32,099
Enjoy the happiness 10 dollars can bring.

127
00:04:32,100 --> 00:04:34,169
- Okay, Jong Kook. - Okay.

128
00:04:34,170 --> 00:04:36,791
(The giraffe hangs up after finding out the tiger's destination.)

129
00:04:38,170 --> 00:04:39,261
I should...

130
00:04:39,939 --> 00:04:41,367
rip off War from this.

131
00:04:41,740 --> 00:04:43,279
He already decided on it.

132
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:44,738
(Let's not even consider that.)

133
00:04:45,780 --> 00:04:50,614
(Kwang Soo calls someone else after talking to Jong Kook.)

134
00:04:52,319 --> 00:04:53,982
- Hello. - Hi, Haha.

135
00:04:55,550 --> 00:04:56,619
Haha.

136
00:04:56,620 --> 00:05:00,029
Whenever we have these kinds of races, I always end up calling you.

137
00:05:00,030 --> 00:05:02,628
As a matter of fact, I was waiting for you like waiting for an alarm.

138
00:05:02,629 --> 00:05:05,415
- Haha. Where are you? Let's meet. - Yes?

139
00:05:05,629 --> 00:05:07,843
Are you trying to get back at me?

140
00:05:08,129 --> 00:05:09,299
(No good will come from our meeting.)

141
00:05:09,300 --> 00:05:11,033
If that's what you have in mind...

142
00:05:12,970 --> 00:05:17,279
(In Episode 440, the Dirty Brothers joined hands.)

143
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:18,909
(Snatching)

144
00:05:18,910 --> 00:05:23,518
(Kwang Soo dearly paid for Haha's last-minute revenge.)

145
00:05:23,519 --> 00:05:26,088
- Let's put that behind us. - Haha.

146
00:05:26,089 --> 00:05:28,568
Let bygone be bygone. Think about it.

147
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:31,458
I couldn't help myself back then because I was angry at you too.

148
00:05:31,459 --> 00:05:32,989
I'll apologize for that.

149
00:05:32,990 --> 00:05:36,059
(We should try living a clean life.)

150
00:05:36,199 --> 00:05:38,898
(Kwang Soo, will you accept my apology?)

151
00:05:38,899 --> 00:05:40,729
If you're still bitter about it,

152
00:05:40,730 --> 00:05:42,606
meet me at the mission spot for War.

153
00:05:43,139 --> 00:05:44,469
Let's meet there, Haha.

154
00:05:44,470 --> 00:05:47,809
(Let's meet there, Haha.)

155
00:05:47,810 --> 00:05:50,779
(He turns down a chance to turn over a new leaf.)

156
00:05:50,780 --> 00:05:53,609
(Will he say yes to this dirty, muddy fight?)

157
00:05:53,610 --> 00:05:56,719
I thought about this, but it's unlikely that I'll be the only one.

158
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:57,919
(I thought about this, but it's unlikely that I'll be the only one.)

159
00:05:57,920 --> 00:06:00,318
I want to go up against you and Seok Jin.

160
00:06:00,319 --> 00:06:01,349
(I want to go up against you and Seok Jin.)

161
00:06:01,350 --> 00:06:02,659
(Let's have a fair fight with the weaklings.)

162
00:06:02,660 --> 00:06:04,559
Sure. Let's do a tough one like real men.

163
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:05,559
I'd love to.

164
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:07,559
- Okay. - Meet me at War.

165
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:09,359
- Okay. - Sure.

166
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:10,757
(Come to the spot for War right now.)

167
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:13,463
Sir, please drive me to the spot for 10 Dollars.

168
00:06:14,399 --> 00:06:16,787
I won't get off there. I'll scope out the area.

169
00:06:17,540 --> 00:06:21,039
If someone gets lucky, he or she can be the only one there.

170
00:06:21,269 --> 00:06:22,289
It's Jae Seok.

171
00:06:23,180 --> 00:06:24,362
Hey, Jae Seok.

172
00:06:24,439 --> 00:06:25,969
Where are you, Seok Jin?

173
00:06:26,009 --> 00:06:29,008
Where do you think? I'm just in the car.

174
00:06:29,009 --> 00:06:31,779
Where are you heading to now?

175
00:06:31,780 --> 00:06:35,549
The guys seem to come to the spot that I'm going to.

176
00:06:35,550 --> 00:06:37,192
(I'm very popular today.)

177
00:06:37,790 --> 00:06:40,105
They don't want to go where Jong Kook is going to.

178
00:06:40,189 --> 00:06:42,229
Okay. Where is Jong Kook going?

179
00:06:42,230 --> 00:06:43,657
He's going to the spot for War.

180
00:06:43,829 --> 00:06:46,068
My gosh. Come on, seriously.

181
00:06:46,069 --> 00:06:49,469
(He lies that Jong Kook chose War, thinking Jong Kook chose Science.)

182
00:06:49,470 --> 00:06:50,768
You were going to choose War, right?

183
00:06:50,769 --> 00:06:52,469
I was about to go there.

184
00:06:52,470 --> 00:06:54,408
My gosh, you can't go there.

185
00:06:54,470 --> 00:06:55,765
Jong Kook will go to the spot for War?

186
00:06:55,769 --> 00:06:56,860
Yes, he will.

187
00:06:57,110 --> 00:06:59,239
We shouldn't let him take the Card all by himself.

188
00:06:59,240 --> 00:07:01,351
No. Just let him have that.

189
00:07:01,449 --> 00:07:03,183
- Okay. I got it. - We should let him.

190
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:04,371
Okay.

191
00:07:06,620 --> 00:07:08,527
Hey, I might be the only one at the mission spot for War.

192
00:07:09,689 --> 00:07:11,597
My gosh, I should...

193
00:07:11,860 --> 00:07:13,588
I should tell the other members.

194
00:07:13,589 --> 00:07:14,888
I should spread this rumor.

195
00:07:14,889 --> 00:07:16,628
(His plan is to spread the news, so no one comes to the spot.)

196
00:07:16,629 --> 00:07:18,191
Jong Kook is headed to the spot for War.

197
00:07:18,759 --> 00:07:21,279
Then, I'll avoid choosing War today.

198
00:07:21,300 --> 00:07:23,469
Jong Kook is heading to the mission spot for War. Just don't go there.

199
00:07:23,470 --> 00:07:24,623
Is that so?

200
00:07:24,870 --> 00:07:27,388
Then, I should avoid going there too.

201
00:07:27,709 --> 00:07:28,869
- Okay, Seok Jin. - Hey.

202
00:07:28,870 --> 00:07:30,909
See you at War. Wait, no. I won't be there.

203
00:07:30,910 --> 00:07:33,051
(He slips as he's not careful.)

204
00:07:33,079 --> 00:07:34,809
(However, the only downside is that Jong Kook is really headed there.)

205
00:07:34,810 --> 00:07:36,717
(However, the only downside is that Jong Kook is really headed there.)

206
00:07:37,420 --> 00:07:39,688
(The entrance of the mission spot for 10 Dollars is empty.)

207
00:07:39,689 --> 00:07:40,919
No one is really here.

208
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:45,274
(Kwang Soo arrives at an empty entrance of Dosan Park.)

209
00:07:45,819 --> 00:07:47,288
Staying here is a way too. Okay.

210
00:07:47,660 --> 00:07:48,852
I'm serious.

211
00:07:52,629 --> 00:07:54,429
(15 minutes before the time is up, he's at the spot for 10 Dollars.)

212
00:07:54,430 --> 00:07:56,068
I just need to stay here for 15 minutes.

213
00:07:56,069 --> 00:07:58,038
(15 minutes before the time is up, he's at the spot for 10 Dollars.)

214
00:07:58,499 --> 00:08:02,838
(If you think I'm a dirty player, go somewhere else.)

215
00:08:02,839 --> 00:08:03,900
What?

216
00:08:04,740 --> 00:08:08,993
(1 mysterious vehicle approaches the mission spot.)

217
00:08:09,209 --> 00:08:11,578
(Who is it?)

218
00:08:11,579 --> 00:08:12,670
Hey.

219
00:08:13,449 --> 00:08:14,518
Why did you come here?

220
00:08:14,519 --> 00:08:17,789
(Who is this member that showed up in front of Kwang Soo?)

221
00:08:17,790 --> 00:08:21,159
(Jae Seok the Rabbit ran away from Jong Kook the Tiger.)

222
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:22,455
My gosh.

223
00:08:23,100 --> 00:08:24,150
Why are you here?

224
00:08:24,459 --> 00:08:25,785
I'm guarding this place.

225
00:08:25,999 --> 00:08:27,669
- Why are you guarding this place? - I'm guarding this place.

226
00:08:27,670 --> 00:08:30,526
I'm going to win the Chance Card whatever it takes.

227
00:08:30,569 --> 00:08:32,099
- Get lost. - How could you say that?

228
00:08:32,100 --> 00:08:33,263
What are you talking about?

229
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:35,438
Let me wait here for a second.

230
00:08:35,439 --> 00:08:38,162
(Seok Jin arrives at the spot for War with 12 minutes left.)

231
00:08:39,380 --> 00:08:41,478
I think the rumor I spread worked.

232
00:08:41,479 --> 00:08:43,254
The rumor that Jong Kook is headed here.

233
00:08:44,550 --> 00:08:45,749
(Seok Jin's waiting at the spot.)

234
00:08:45,750 --> 00:08:47,718
I might be able to get this place all to myself.

235
00:08:47,719 --> 00:08:48,841
This might be all mine.

236
00:08:49,560 --> 00:08:50,919
(However, at that moment...)

237
00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:52,083
Someone is coming.

238
00:08:52,619 --> 00:08:53,853
Someone is coming.

239
00:08:55,459 --> 00:08:56,659
My gosh, who is it?

240
00:08:56,660 --> 00:08:58,159
(A mysterious vehicle approaches Seok Jin's car.)

241
00:08:58,160 --> 00:08:59,250
Who is it?

242
00:09:00,569 --> 00:09:01,854
Gosh, this is driving me crazy.

243
00:09:02,229 --> 00:09:03,269
Who is it?

244
00:09:03,270 --> 00:09:04,338
(I already got the word out.)

245
00:09:04,339 --> 00:09:05,368
Who is it?

246
00:09:05,369 --> 00:09:08,169
(This member bravely shows up at the mission spot for War.)

247
00:09:08,170 --> 00:09:12,260
(Who is the member that has arrived at this very spot?)

248
00:09:12,339 --> 00:09:13,509
(It's none other than...)

249
00:09:13,510 --> 00:09:17,600
(Jong Kook the Tiger who only had eyes for War.)

250
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:19,994
Sir. Sir.

251
00:09:20,390 --> 00:09:21,441
Sir.

252
00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:22,641
We must hurry.

253
00:09:22,920 --> 00:09:24,755
Please go to the closest mission spot from here.

254
00:09:24,859 --> 00:09:26,858
I don't care where it is. It just can't be here.

255
00:09:26,859 --> 00:09:28,529
(Take me anywhere that Jong Kook isn't at.)

256
00:09:28,530 --> 00:09:30,875
My gosh, I spread the rumor. Why...

257
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:33,264
Gosh, that wasn't a rumor.

258
00:09:36,140 --> 00:09:37,838
Let's check if anyone else is here.

259
00:09:37,839 --> 00:09:40,727
(Jong Kook arrives with 8 minutes left.)

260
00:09:41,369 --> 00:09:45,766
(And another car arrives at the spot for War.)

261
00:09:48,079 --> 00:09:51,049
(And the member that arrives this time is...)

262
00:09:51,050 --> 00:09:53,335
(Se Chan.)

263
00:09:53,750 --> 00:09:54,919
(And he spots someone.)

264
00:09:54,920 --> 00:09:56,010
Okay.

265
00:09:56,459 --> 00:09:59,059
(Seok Jin's stylist couldn't tag along.)

266
00:09:59,060 --> 00:10:01,538
Okay. The weakest guy is in there.

267
00:10:02,089 --> 00:10:04,506
Seok Jin is here. Okay.

268
00:10:06,270 --> 00:10:07,468
I hear noises.

269
00:10:07,469 --> 00:10:09,581
- Let's do this. - Someone came.

270
00:10:09,670 --> 00:10:10,669
Mr. 54-year-old.

271
00:10:10,670 --> 00:10:11,799
(Hello, my weak Mr. 54-year-old...)

272
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:12,799
(No, it's the strongest brother.)

273
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:14,738
- Hello. - Hey.

274
00:10:14,739 --> 00:10:16,066
You're not Seok Jin.

275
00:10:16,380 --> 00:10:17,909
Jong Kook, what happened?

276
00:10:17,910 --> 00:10:19,102
- Okay. - I mean...

277
00:10:19,380 --> 00:10:21,848
- You really chose this one. - You bet.

278
00:10:21,849 --> 00:10:23,043
You said...

279
00:10:23,250 --> 00:10:24,478
if I tried to survive, I'd die.

280
00:10:24,479 --> 00:10:25,978
- And vice versa. - Right.

281
00:10:25,979 --> 00:10:27,749
After hearing that, I came here to survive.

282
00:10:27,750 --> 00:10:29,049
- But I'll die in the end. - Right.

283
00:10:29,050 --> 00:10:30,590
- I'll die in the end. - See?

284
00:10:31,089 --> 00:10:33,059
- Okay. I don't know what it is. - It's just me?

285
00:10:33,060 --> 00:10:34,688
I'm not sure. Will we have more people?

286
00:10:34,689 --> 00:10:36,999
(Will they start the mission for War like this?)

287
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,399
(Hey! Someone else came.)

288
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:40,553
Gosh, why did he come here?

289
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:45,299
(Haha, another guy looking for his grave site)

290
00:10:45,300 --> 00:10:46,390
Gosh, Se Chan.

291
00:10:46,410 --> 00:10:49,269
- Haha is here. - Gosh.

292
00:10:49,270 --> 00:10:50,605
Why did you come here?

293
00:10:50,979 --> 00:10:53,009
I came here to have a war.

294
00:10:53,010 --> 00:10:55,498
This means one of the members will be alone.

295
00:10:56,180 --> 00:10:57,718
(So Min is almost at another mission spot.)

296
00:10:57,719 --> 00:10:59,454
Why are there so many people? Who is it?

297
00:10:59,989 --> 00:11:01,111
Who is it?

298
00:11:01,689 --> 00:11:02,842
Seok Jin didn't come?

299
00:11:03,060 --> 00:11:04,385
Isn't that Jae Seok?

300
00:11:04,589 --> 00:11:06,017
I thought he chose War.

301
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:08,188
- Rock-paper-scissors. - Rock-paper-scissors. Okay!

302
00:11:08,189 --> 00:11:10,882
(Clueless of So Min's arrival, these two keep bickering.)

303
00:11:11,329 --> 00:11:13,267
Wait. Hold up!

304
00:11:13,300 --> 00:11:14,320
Guys!

305
00:11:15,229 --> 00:11:16,596
So Min, why did you come here?

306
00:11:17,699 --> 00:11:18,822
I thought you...

307
00:11:19,099 --> 00:11:20,708
- So Min, listen. - were heading to War.

308
00:11:20,709 --> 00:11:21,862
That's where Jong Kook is.

309
00:11:24,439 --> 00:11:25,500
Why?

310
00:11:25,640 --> 00:11:26,803
Is this how we play this?

311
00:11:26,849 --> 00:11:27,978
- What are we doing? - Good.

312
00:11:27,979 --> 00:11:29,959
So Min, you'll do the mission for the keyword, 10 Dollars.

313
00:11:30,150 --> 00:11:31,179
What are we doing?

314
00:11:31,180 --> 00:11:32,679
(It's settled that three of them will do the mission.)

315
00:11:33,390 --> 00:11:36,928
I cannot believe that Jong Kook came. Seriously.

316
00:11:37,060 --> 00:11:38,389
(This 54-year-old rabbit is running away from the tiger.)

317
00:11:38,390 --> 00:11:40,059
I'm nervous. Who else will be here?

318
00:11:40,060 --> 00:11:42,289
I hope no one is here. Please.

319
00:11:42,290 --> 00:11:44,399
Please. Please.

320
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:45,429
(The spot for 10 dollars is empty.)

321
00:11:45,430 --> 00:11:46,450
No one is here.

322
00:11:47,270 --> 00:11:48,529
I think no one came.

323
00:11:48,530 --> 00:11:49,669
(He jumps to conclusions again.)

324
00:11:49,670 --> 00:11:50,720
No one came, right?

325
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,838
(He has no idea that the others already went in.)

326
00:11:52,839 --> 00:11:54,068
Where is the spot? Is this it?

327
00:11:54,069 --> 00:11:55,232
Should I go in?

328
00:11:55,339 --> 00:11:57,379
No one is here. Okay.

329
00:11:57,380 --> 00:11:59,043
(Seok Jin keeps assuming today.)

330
00:12:00,010 --> 00:12:01,708
I don't even see the cars. There are no cars here.

331
00:12:01,709 --> 00:12:03,078
(He's excited at the hope of getting the Chance Card.)

332
00:12:03,079 --> 00:12:04,171
No one is here.

333
00:12:04,849 --> 00:12:06,948
- Here. I got it. - Tell us the mission already.

334
00:12:06,949 --> 00:12:08,919
There it is. One more member will join you.

335
00:12:08,920 --> 00:12:10,088
- Who is that? - Is that Seok Jin?

336
00:12:10,089 --> 00:12:11,559
Why is he coming here?

337
00:12:11,560 --> 00:12:12,987
- Why did you come here? - Darn it.

338
00:12:13,089 --> 00:12:14,283
Seok Jin!

339
00:12:14,729 --> 00:12:16,629
Hey, why are you guys here?

340
00:12:16,630 --> 00:12:18,698
(The 54-year-old rabbit runs into the trap he set up.)

341
00:12:18,699 --> 00:12:20,026
Why are you guys here?

342
00:12:20,099 --> 00:12:22,899
- I thought you were taking a walk. - We're doomed.

343
00:12:22,900 --> 00:12:24,430
Why did you come here?

344
00:12:24,469 --> 00:12:25,999
It was because of Jong Kook.

345
00:12:26,300 --> 00:12:27,509
I came here to run away from him.

346
00:12:27,510 --> 00:12:29,309
What about the Korean Alphabets? You should've gone there.

347
00:12:29,310 --> 00:12:31,039
Gosh, this is exhausting.

348
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:33,909
This means that a Chance Card will be granted to someone right away.

349
00:12:33,910 --> 00:12:35,679
- Yes, that's right. - It's Jong Kook.

350
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:37,618
- You'll find out later. - Three spots are left.

351
00:12:37,619 --> 00:12:38,749
It's either Science or the Korean Alphabets.

352
00:12:38,750 --> 00:12:39,889
(Science, War, Korean Alphabets, and 10 Dollars)

353
00:12:39,890 --> 00:12:40,941
Is this the spot?

354
00:12:42,449 --> 00:12:44,519
(Ji Hyo arrives at the spot for Science with 4 minutes left.)

355
00:12:44,520 --> 00:12:45,588
Yes.

356
00:12:45,589 --> 00:12:47,559
(Ji Hyo arrives at the spot for Science with 4 minutes left.)

357
00:12:47,560 --> 00:12:50,858
Since you're the only one who's at the mission spot,

358
00:12:50,859 --> 00:12:52,458
you've acquired the Chance Card.

359
00:12:52,459 --> 00:12:55,899
I told you. Everyone tried to deceive each other.

360
00:12:55,900 --> 00:12:57,269
There's no point in going there.

361
00:12:57,270 --> 00:12:58,338
(She's indeed Lady Luck.)

362
00:12:58,339 --> 00:13:01,509
Among 4 Chance Cards, you can only choose 1.

363
00:13:01,510 --> 00:13:03,578
There's no dud, right? Are they all the same?

364
00:13:03,579 --> 00:13:04,804
(She can choose 1 out of 4.)

365
00:13:04,939 --> 00:13:05,978
Is this it?

366
00:13:05,979 --> 00:13:07,785
(Ji Hyo obtains the Chance Card which will help in the final race.)

367
00:13:08,180 --> 00:13:11,412
Starting my day with these minnows will be exhausting.

368
00:13:11,579 --> 00:13:14,139
The mission for the keyword, 10 Dollars,

369
00:13:14,420 --> 00:13:15,448
is...

370
00:13:15,449 --> 00:13:16,858
Blow for the Money.

371
00:13:16,859 --> 00:13:18,358
(Blow for the Money)

372
00:13:18,359 --> 00:13:19,389
- "Blow for the Money"? - All right.

373
00:13:19,390 --> 00:13:21,633
It will be a tournament in pairs.

374
00:13:21,890 --> 00:13:24,559
You will blow away the flour in the bowl.

375
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:26,999
And the member who figures out the amount of money...

376
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,498
under the flour will win the match.

377
00:13:29,130 --> 00:13:30,899
(Okay. We understood the rules.)

378
00:13:30,900 --> 00:13:32,022
Even before...

379
00:13:32,099 --> 00:13:34,048
we heard what the mission was, Seok Jin said,

380
00:13:34,469 --> 00:13:35,468
"Do it with me."

381
00:13:35,469 --> 00:13:37,418
(Whispering)

382
00:13:37,540 --> 00:13:40,108
(Just now, the rules were being announced to them.)

383
00:13:40,109 --> 00:13:41,149
(When he said it'd be done in pairs...)

384
00:13:41,150 --> 00:13:42,309
Do it with me.

385
00:13:42,310 --> 00:13:45,339
(Do it with me.)

386
00:13:45,349 --> 00:13:46,749
(The weakest guy picks the weakest girl.)

387
00:13:46,750 --> 00:13:47,943
I'm the weakest here.

388
00:13:48,119 --> 00:13:49,618
Everyone knows here that I'm the weakest.

389
00:13:49,619 --> 00:13:52,068
If this happened on a blind date...

390
00:13:52,119 --> 00:13:53,828
or in a situation like that,

391
00:13:53,829 --> 00:13:55,012
- Right, right. - It's a heart-fluttering moment.

392
00:13:55,130 --> 00:13:56,429
"Hey, do it with me."

393
00:13:56,430 --> 00:13:57,654
(It would've been heart-fluttering.)

394
00:13:58,430 --> 00:14:00,568
(Team up with me.)

395
00:14:00,569 --> 00:14:01,999
This is like...

396
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,438
- holding hands under the table. - Right.

397
00:14:03,439 --> 00:14:06,299
(This is like holding hands under the table in secret.)

398
00:14:06,300 --> 00:14:07,769
- It'd look like that. - But this is a competition.

399
00:14:07,770 --> 00:14:09,438
Gosh, you're so low.

400
00:14:09,439 --> 00:14:10,500
But this is a competition.

401
00:14:10,609 --> 00:14:14,353
Everyone, pair up with an opponent you'll compete against.

402
00:14:14,550 --> 00:14:15,630
All right.

403
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:17,549
- Should we flip for it? - Let's do that.

404
00:14:17,550 --> 00:14:19,417
- Why? You two can do it. - Let's flip for it.

405
00:14:19,650 --> 00:14:21,935
- Or rock-paper-scissors? - Okay.

406
00:14:22,119 --> 00:14:23,789
(They'll choose their opponent after playing rock-paper-scissors?)

407
00:14:23,790 --> 00:14:25,013
- Okay. That sounds good. - Okay.

408
00:14:25,790 --> 00:14:26,912
- Rock-paper-scissors. - Rock-paper-scissors.

409
00:14:27,329 --> 00:14:30,359
(Seok Jin and So Min lose.)

410
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:33,929
(He won't be able to pick So Min for his opponent.)

411
00:14:33,930 --> 00:14:35,122
I can't ever win.

412
00:14:35,300 --> 00:14:36,669
The winner gets to pick.

413
00:14:36,670 --> 00:14:37,968
(He confirms it once again.)

414
00:14:37,969 --> 00:14:39,438
- We'll pick our opponent. - Yes.

415
00:14:39,439 --> 00:14:40,468
(Looking determined)

416
00:14:40,469 --> 00:14:42,509
I'm very popular when it comes to choosing opponents, you know?

417
00:14:42,510 --> 00:14:43,509
(Weak So Min gets popular.)

418
00:14:43,510 --> 00:14:45,738
But both of you are popular today.

419
00:14:45,739 --> 00:14:47,719
Right. That's so true.

420
00:14:47,979 --> 00:14:49,988
- Both of you are popular. - Stop it.

421
00:14:50,020 --> 00:14:51,141
Get ready.

422
00:14:51,250 --> 00:14:52,371
Rock-paper-scissors.

423
00:14:53,319 --> 00:14:54,618
My gosh. This is intense.

424
00:14:54,619 --> 00:14:56,488
- It's intense for no reason. - Rock-paper-scissors.

425
00:14:56,489 --> 00:14:58,818
(Who will be the winner of this intense-for-no-reason match?)

426
00:14:58,819 --> 00:15:00,358
(Kwang Soo wins.)

427
00:15:00,359 --> 00:15:01,488
Okay! So Min!

428
00:15:01,489 --> 00:15:04,999
(Okay! So Min!)

429
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,110
I don't feel good about this at all. Not at all.

430
00:15:07,199 --> 00:15:08,934
You're so petty.

431
00:15:09,130 --> 00:15:12,169
- How could you choose her? - So Min.

432
00:15:12,170 --> 00:15:13,362
So Min!

433
00:15:13,640 --> 00:15:14,809
Okay. Seok Jin.

434
00:15:14,810 --> 00:15:16,645
- So Min and Kwang Soo will go 1st. - They'll go 1st.

435
00:15:16,709 --> 00:15:18,309
You can't be sure. So Min might win.

436
00:15:18,310 --> 00:15:19,738
- Yes, I might win. - You can't be sure.

437
00:15:19,739 --> 00:15:20,903
- Right. - Who knows?

438
00:15:21,280 --> 00:15:23,249
- How are we supposed to play? - The flour...

439
00:15:23,250 --> 00:15:24,443
(The game is set up now.)

440
00:15:24,520 --> 00:15:26,818
All right. Under the flour,

441
00:15:26,819 --> 00:15:28,962
- there's money. - I see.

442
00:15:29,089 --> 00:15:32,588
The one who writes down the amount in the back will win.

443
00:15:32,589 --> 00:15:34,259
(They must blow out the flour to figure out the amount.)

444
00:15:34,260 --> 00:15:35,289
Will there be coins?

445
00:15:35,290 --> 00:15:36,453
There will be coins.

446
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:38,259
- There are many types of bills. - That's hard.

447
00:15:38,260 --> 00:15:40,568
- The total amount? - Write down the total amount.

448
00:15:40,569 --> 00:15:41,598
That's hard.

449
00:15:41,599 --> 00:15:43,506
- My gosh, this sounds hard. - This isn't easy.

450
00:15:43,640 --> 00:15:44,691
Get ready.

451
00:15:45,239 --> 00:15:47,738
- Set. Go. - Get ready.

452
00:15:47,739 --> 00:15:48,963
(The mission for Chance Card starts.)

453
00:15:50,709 --> 00:15:52,608
(He attacks her with the powder as soon as they start.)

454
00:15:52,609 --> 00:15:56,353
(She'll play dirty too. She retaliates.)

455
00:15:56,680 --> 00:15:59,842
(Coughing)

456
00:16:00,420 --> 00:16:03,118
(The game has changed into Blow for the Flour.)

457
00:16:03,119 --> 00:16:05,519
(As they keep on blowing to ruin one another...)

458
00:16:05,520 --> 00:16:06,917
- I can see it. - I can see it.

459
00:16:07,790 --> 00:16:09,188
- I can see it. - I can see it.

460
00:16:09,189 --> 00:16:11,698
(They finally find their first dollar.)

461
00:16:11,699 --> 00:16:13,769
(Let me take a breath.)

462
00:16:13,770 --> 00:16:17,920
(She starts attacking him by exhaling into the white flour.)

463
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:20,608
- Hey, let's work together. - Yes, you have to.

464
00:16:20,609 --> 00:16:21,968
- Yes. - There's too much.

465
00:16:21,969 --> 00:16:23,238
- Let's work together. - How should we...

466
00:16:23,239 --> 00:16:25,524
(She wanted to look at him when they made up.)

467
00:16:26,140 --> 00:16:27,279
Look at him.

468
00:16:27,280 --> 00:16:28,649
(He can't be polite with this face.)

469
00:16:28,650 --> 00:16:30,485
I can't do this. I can't.

470
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:32,001
I'll choose War.

471
00:16:32,750 --> 00:16:35,049
Korean Alphabets. I'll choose the Korean Alphabet.

472
00:16:35,050 --> 00:16:36,149
(I'm done too.)

473
00:16:36,150 --> 00:16:38,858
(I'm so glad I didn't go up against them.)

474
00:16:38,859 --> 00:16:42,188
(Let's just blow out the flour instead of looking at ourselves.)

475
00:16:42,189 --> 00:16:44,137
- I can see it. I can see the money. - I see it.

476
00:16:45,500 --> 00:16:48,568
(They find the second dollar.)

477
00:16:48,569 --> 00:16:51,068
(And then, the third dollar.)

478
00:16:51,069 --> 00:16:52,198
Is it a foreign currency?

479
00:16:52,199 --> 00:16:53,338
(So Min attacks him.)

480
00:16:53,339 --> 00:16:54,368
No, it's a Korean dollar.

481
00:16:54,369 --> 00:16:55,608
My gosh.

482
00:16:55,609 --> 00:16:56,803
(He counterattacks.)

483
00:16:57,140 --> 00:16:58,879
(They fight for a while.)

484
00:16:58,880 --> 00:17:00,149
- There's one over there. - You're right.

485
00:17:00,150 --> 00:17:01,348
- There's a five-dollar bill. - There's a lot.

486
00:17:01,349 --> 00:17:02,509
(He finds a 50-dollar bill.)

487
00:17:02,510 --> 00:17:05,743
(They finally see all the bills.)

488
00:17:05,819 --> 00:17:07,118
There's money inside.

489
00:17:07,119 --> 00:17:08,789
(Kwang Soo writes 62 dollars.)

490
00:17:08,790 --> 00:17:09,989
(He's wrong.)

491
00:17:09,990 --> 00:17:11,059
- He's wrong. - He is wrong.

492
00:17:11,060 --> 00:17:12,489
(One 50-dollar bill, one 10-dollar bill, three 1-dollar bills.)

493
00:17:12,490 --> 00:17:13,755
So Min, hurry.

494
00:17:13,960 --> 00:17:14,959
There's no time to rest.

495
00:17:14,960 --> 00:17:16,286
(A coin falls.)

496
00:17:17,159 --> 00:17:19,608
(A coin falls from the tray.)

497
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,255
What? Something fell.

498
00:17:22,270 --> 00:17:23,699
(How much is that?)

499
00:17:23,700 --> 00:17:25,372
- What is this? - Is that a nickel?

500
00:17:25,800 --> 00:17:26,838
Is that a nickel?

501
00:17:26,839 --> 00:17:27,868
(She hides the coin.)

502
00:17:27,869 --> 00:17:29,608
Wait. How much was it?

503
00:17:29,609 --> 00:17:32,138
(He's irritated.)

504
00:17:32,139 --> 00:17:33,231
(She throws it.)

505
00:17:33,409 --> 00:17:34,479
How much was it?

506
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:36,417
(You can go there and find out.)

507
00:17:37,220 --> 00:17:38,606
They're playing...

508
00:17:38,750 --> 00:17:40,146
- It's a nickel. - very dirty.

509
00:17:40,790 --> 00:17:42,686
(She finds another coin.)

510
00:17:44,520 --> 00:17:45,682
55 cents?

511
00:17:46,060 --> 00:17:48,335
(She throws it before Kwang Soo arrives.)

512
00:17:48,790 --> 00:17:51,890
(They're glad to be watching.)

513
00:17:53,530 --> 00:17:55,229
(Clinking)

514
00:17:55,230 --> 00:17:56,898
(She finds another coin.)

515
00:17:56,899 --> 00:17:58,138
- What was it? - Hold on.

516
00:17:58,139 --> 00:17:59,638
(She picks it up.)

517
00:17:59,639 --> 00:18:00,709
There's so much money.

518
00:18:00,710 --> 00:18:02,009
How much was it? Was it a coin?

519
00:18:02,010 --> 00:18:06,019
(So Min writes down her answer.)

520
00:18:07,149 --> 00:18:08,608
(So Min writes 63 dollars and 65 cents.)

521
00:18:08,609 --> 00:18:09,949
63 dollars and 65 cents.

522
00:18:09,950 --> 00:18:13,591
(Is she right?)

523
00:18:13,919 --> 00:18:15,011
- No. - You're wrong.

524
00:18:15,950 --> 00:18:18,612
(How much did I stash away?)

525
00:18:20,490 --> 00:18:21,989
"63 dollars and 65 cents".

526
00:18:22,889 --> 00:18:24,029
- There's a lot of money. - My gosh.

527
00:18:24,030 --> 00:18:25,259
There's a lot.

528
00:18:25,260 --> 00:18:26,350
(There's quite a bit of money hidden.)

529
00:18:26,599 --> 00:18:29,354
(They need to dig in deeper.)

530
00:18:30,669 --> 00:18:31,996
63 dollars...

531
00:18:33,869 --> 00:18:34,961
63 dollars...

532
00:18:35,240 --> 00:18:36,974
How can I do this when she's stashing away the money?

533
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:39,452
You need to explain the rules to her!

534
00:18:39,909 --> 00:18:41,678
(Don't act like a newbie.)

535
00:18:41,679 --> 00:18:42,908
(A bunch of coins falls.)

536
00:18:42,909 --> 00:18:43,971
They fell.

537
00:18:44,419 --> 00:18:45,704
(The total amount of bills is 63 dollars.)

538
00:18:45,750 --> 00:18:46,749
Hey.

539
00:18:46,750 --> 00:18:49,911
(They need to figure out the amount of coins.)

540
00:18:50,319 --> 00:18:51,559
(Kwang Soo writes 63 dollars and 76 cents.)

541
00:18:51,560 --> 00:18:52,858
- Let me answer! - That's wrong.

542
00:18:52,859 --> 00:18:53,879
You're very close.

543
00:18:54,030 --> 00:18:55,088
(Kwang Soo is close?)

544
00:18:55,089 --> 00:18:56,729
It's not 76 cents.

545
00:18:56,730 --> 00:18:58,158
(Kwang Soo is close?)

546
00:18:58,159 --> 00:19:00,068
(So Min writes 63 dollars and 75 cents.)

547
00:19:00,069 --> 00:19:04,299
(If she's right, she'll be in the play-off.)

548
00:19:04,300 --> 00:19:05,493
So Min is right.

549
00:19:05,770 --> 00:19:07,370
Why did you write 76 cents?

550
00:19:07,970 --> 00:19:09,039
So Min is right.

551
00:19:09,040 --> 00:19:11,325
(That was the answer?)

552
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:13,648
(So Min will go to the play-off.)

553
00:19:13,649 --> 00:19:15,178
- I was a cent off? - I saw it.

554
00:19:15,179 --> 00:19:16,578
There was a nickel.

555
00:19:16,579 --> 00:19:19,049
(She hid the nickel.)

556
00:19:19,050 --> 00:19:21,090
(Thanks to this nickel, I've won.)

557
00:19:21,819 --> 00:19:24,543
Next time, reduce the number of bills and the amount of flour.

558
00:19:24,659 --> 00:19:26,802
What is the point of making such corrections now?

559
00:19:27,929 --> 00:19:28,959
(Pale)

560
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:30,459
- Okay. - Okay.

561
00:19:30,460 --> 00:19:32,328
I'm looking forward to this big match.

562
00:19:32,329 --> 00:19:33,828
(This is the 2nd round between 2 middle-aged men.)

563
00:19:33,829 --> 00:19:35,229
(It's Jae Seok versus...)

564
00:19:35,230 --> 00:19:36,250
(Seok Jin.)

565
00:19:36,669 --> 00:19:37,838
It's a big match.

566
00:19:37,839 --> 00:19:38,962
- Let's do this! - It's a big match.

567
00:19:39,240 --> 00:19:41,039
- Get ready. - Okay.

568
00:19:41,040 --> 00:19:42,608
I'll do this.

569
00:19:42,609 --> 00:19:44,009
(Suddenly,)

570
00:19:44,010 --> 00:19:45,408
What are you doing?

571
00:19:45,409 --> 00:19:47,491
(Jae Seok prepares himself.)

572
00:19:47,780 --> 00:19:49,709
We shouldn't have gone first.

573
00:19:49,710 --> 00:19:52,378
- It's important who goes first. - Yes, we could've been prepared.

574
00:19:52,379 --> 00:19:54,219
- We couldn't prepare at all. - After watching them,

575
00:19:54,220 --> 00:19:55,318
I got some tips.

576
00:19:55,319 --> 00:19:56,858
I had no idea...

577
00:19:56,859 --> 00:19:58,459
- the order was so crucial. - I know.

578
00:19:58,460 --> 00:20:00,531
You're right. We should cover ourselves.

579
00:20:01,690 --> 00:20:03,189
I doubt Seok Jin can blow that hard.

580
00:20:03,190 --> 00:20:05,067
I think he has weak lungs.

581
00:20:06,030 --> 00:20:07,090
Okay.

582
00:20:07,530 --> 00:20:10,868
(They're all ready now.)

583
00:20:10,869 --> 00:20:13,144
(Which one of them will win the victory?)

584
00:20:13,399 --> 00:20:14,638
Ready, set, go.

585
00:20:14,639 --> 00:20:15,638
(He blows the whistle.)

586
00:20:15,639 --> 00:20:16,934
You're strong.

587
00:20:17,579 --> 00:20:20,148
(After giving two strong blows,)

588
00:20:20,149 --> 00:20:21,944
(Seok Jin begins to cough.)

589
00:20:22,649 --> 00:20:25,178
(He's dazed.)

590
00:20:25,179 --> 00:20:27,495
(He's struggling.)

591
00:20:28,349 --> 00:20:32,908
(They feel sorry for him.)

592
00:20:33,490 --> 00:20:34,588
I'll do it instead.

593
00:20:34,589 --> 00:20:36,394
I'm afraid they'll pass out.

594
00:20:36,790 --> 00:20:38,358
- Let me. - Please.

595
00:20:38,359 --> 00:20:40,094
- Please make them stop! - Please stop!

596
00:20:40,569 --> 00:20:41,628
Please make them stop!

597
00:20:41,629 --> 00:20:44,068
(Amidst their painful exhales,)

598
00:20:44,069 --> 00:20:47,231
(a 10-dollar bill is found.)

599
00:20:48,040 --> 00:20:49,039
(Is this it?)

600
00:20:49,040 --> 00:20:50,539
- I can't bear... - Did you get one?

601
00:20:50,540 --> 00:20:51,709
- That's it? - to watch them do this.

602
00:20:51,710 --> 00:20:52,809
- Is that it? - What?

603
00:20:52,810 --> 00:20:53,878
That's it?

604
00:20:53,879 --> 00:20:56,809
(They both run towards their boards.)

605
00:20:56,810 --> 00:20:57,870
Wait.

606
00:20:58,480 --> 00:21:01,550
(Jae Seok finishes writing the answer first.)

607
00:21:02,119 --> 00:21:04,559
(Soon after, Seok Jin follows.)

608
00:21:04,560 --> 00:21:05,559
This is wrong, right?

609
00:21:05,560 --> 00:21:10,428
(Is Jae Seok's answer right?)

610
00:21:10,429 --> 00:21:11,529
- This is wrong, right? - Is that a dollar or 10 dollars?

611
00:21:11,530 --> 00:21:12,550
10 dollars.

612
00:21:12,730 --> 00:21:14,229
Jae Seok wins.

613
00:21:16,030 --> 00:21:17,039
- What? - That was it?

614
00:21:17,040 --> 00:21:19,598
(Jae Seok gets it right.)

615
00:21:19,599 --> 00:21:21,200
- What? - What is this?

616
00:21:21,470 --> 00:21:22,769
(There was only 10 dollars?)

617
00:21:22,770 --> 00:21:23,800
That was it?

618
00:21:24,740 --> 00:21:25,838
- What? - But when...

619
00:21:25,839 --> 00:21:26,838
- we did it, - What is this?

620
00:21:26,839 --> 00:21:28,378
- We had all those coins! - it was harder than this.

621
00:21:28,379 --> 00:21:29,509
- There was a nickel too. - It looked too hard,

622
00:21:29,510 --> 00:21:30,749
so we took it down a notch.

623
00:21:30,750 --> 00:21:32,618
This is why going first is a disadvantage.

624
00:21:32,619 --> 00:21:33,719
(This match was customized.)

625
00:21:33,720 --> 00:21:34,918
(Jae Seok will now have a match with So Min.)

626
00:21:34,919 --> 00:21:36,918
I wrote 10 dollars too, but I was late.

627
00:21:36,919 --> 00:21:39,673
(Which one of them will obtain a Chance Card?)

628
00:21:40,020 --> 00:21:43,529
This is your mission for obtaining a Chance Card.

629
00:21:43,530 --> 00:21:46,253
The mission that befits your keyword, War, is...

630
00:21:46,359 --> 00:21:48,068
Protect the Gate.

631
00:21:48,069 --> 00:21:49,120
"Gate"?

632
00:21:49,829 --> 00:21:52,624
It'll be a tournament with two players at a time.

633
00:21:52,669 --> 00:21:54,338
There will be an offense and a defense.

634
00:21:54,339 --> 00:21:56,739
The offense will need to penetrate a paper door...

635
00:21:56,740 --> 00:21:59,178
by shooting a rubber gun.

636
00:21:59,179 --> 00:22:01,832
The other player will play defense.

637
00:22:01,879 --> 00:22:04,022
The defense must protect the door with his body.

638
00:22:04,149 --> 00:22:06,628
Rubber gun? It's going to sting.

639
00:22:07,619 --> 00:22:09,289
- We'll be bruised. - What's wrong?

640
00:22:09,290 --> 00:22:10,858
- We'll get bruises. - Okay.

641
00:22:10,859 --> 00:22:12,759
This will hurt. This is a war, indeed.

642
00:22:12,760 --> 00:22:13,912
You're right.

643
00:22:14,089 --> 00:22:15,989
Only the last one standing...

644
00:22:15,990 --> 00:22:17,928
- will receive a Chance Card. - Okay.

645
00:22:17,929 --> 00:22:19,858
- But first, we'll play a mission... - Okay.

646
00:22:19,859 --> 00:22:21,229
that'll make you win by default.

647
00:22:21,230 --> 00:22:22,422
- We can do that? - Okay.

648
00:22:23,030 --> 00:22:24,868
- This is the most crucial game. - Yes.

649
00:22:24,869 --> 00:22:26,068
It is.

650
00:22:26,069 --> 00:22:27,269
This is the most important.

651
00:22:27,270 --> 00:22:28,463
It's the Pirate Roulette Game?

652
00:22:28,710 --> 00:22:30,168
- Okay. - This is good.

653
00:22:30,169 --> 00:22:31,567
- This? - Okay.

654
00:22:31,710 --> 00:22:32,965
Haha.

655
00:22:33,040 --> 00:22:34,249
- This is based on luck. - Okay.

656
00:22:34,250 --> 00:22:35,402
We can do this.

657
00:22:36,909 --> 00:22:37,949
This is based on luck.

658
00:22:37,950 --> 00:22:39,118
(Who will win by default?)

659
00:22:39,119 --> 00:22:42,289
The one who makes the pirate pop up will win.

660
00:22:42,290 --> 00:22:44,489
- Okay. - Which means, the order is crucial.

661
00:22:44,490 --> 00:22:46,418
- Play rock-paper-scissors. - Okay.

662
00:22:46,419 --> 00:22:47,789
- Rock-paper-scissors - Rock-paper-scissors

663
00:22:47,790 --> 00:22:49,421
(Haha loses.)

664
00:22:50,089 --> 00:22:51,732
(Gosh, I'm last.)

665
00:22:52,399 --> 00:22:53,598
- Rock-paper-scissors - Rock-paper-scissors

666
00:22:53,599 --> 00:22:54,928
(Se Chan wins.)

667
00:22:54,929 --> 00:22:56,299
Okay. I'm first.

668
00:22:56,300 --> 00:22:58,269
You must go with your first choice.

669
00:22:58,270 --> 00:22:59,499
- Okay. - You can't switch holes.

670
00:22:59,500 --> 00:23:01,141
I'm the one with the worst luck.

671
00:23:01,339 --> 00:23:02,696
- I'll start. - Okay.

672
00:23:02,909 --> 00:23:04,279
1, 2, 3.

673
00:23:04,280 --> 00:23:05,309
(How will his first attempt play out?)

674
00:23:05,310 --> 00:23:06,408
(The barrel makes a sound.)

675
00:23:06,409 --> 00:23:07,648
(But nothing happens.)

676
00:23:07,649 --> 00:23:09,108
- That's a disappointment. - Okay.

677
00:23:09,109 --> 00:23:11,323
(Go away.)

678
00:23:11,919 --> 00:23:13,102
Jong Kook.

679
00:23:13,149 --> 00:23:14,588
Why did you have to push me?

680
00:23:14,589 --> 00:23:16,549
(General Kim has appeared.)

681
00:23:16,550 --> 00:23:18,600
(I'll win this battle.)

682
00:23:18,690 --> 00:23:19,944
- This is war. - Yes.

683
00:23:20,829 --> 00:23:22,186
(He puts in a sword.)

684
00:23:23,960 --> 00:23:24,999
Okay.

685
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:26,029
(General Kim fails on his first attempt.)

686
00:23:26,030 --> 00:23:27,192
- Thank goodness. - Okay.

687
00:23:28,230 --> 00:23:29,392
- You can't switch holes. - All right.

688
00:23:29,470 --> 00:23:30,838
I will win.

689
00:23:30,839 --> 00:23:32,368
You can't go back...

690
00:23:32,369 --> 00:23:33,469
- on your choice. - No.

691
00:23:33,470 --> 00:23:35,448
Don't change. You can't.

692
00:23:36,270 --> 00:23:37,810
(He puts in a sword.)

693
00:23:38,179 --> 00:23:39,506
- No changing! - Darn it.

694
00:23:40,139 --> 00:23:42,479
(They each got a turn, and it's back to Se Chan.)

695
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:43,775
Okay!

696
00:23:44,020 --> 00:23:45,878
- What was that? We're the same. - I didn't hit you.

697
00:23:45,879 --> 00:23:47,216
- I was cheering you on. - Okay.

698
00:23:47,319 --> 00:23:48,473
I'll start.

699
00:23:49,149 --> 00:23:50,388
- You chose your hole. - 1, 2, 3.

700
00:23:50,389 --> 00:23:51,559
(He inserts the sword.)

701
00:23:51,560 --> 00:23:52,719
(He fails once again.)

702
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:53,789
Okay!

703
00:23:53,790 --> 00:23:54,858
- Just one. - Please!

704
00:23:54,859 --> 00:23:57,628
(There are only 4 holes remaining.)

705
00:23:57,629 --> 00:23:59,568
Just one. Let's just get it once!

706
00:23:59,829 --> 00:24:01,199
- Please! - Please!

707
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:02,328
I need to win!

708
00:24:02,329 --> 00:24:03,529
Okay, it's my turn!

709
00:24:03,530 --> 00:24:04,568
(General Kim fails again.)

710
00:24:04,569 --> 00:24:05,638
(It's Haha's turn.)

711
00:24:05,639 --> 00:24:07,338
If you fail, I win. It'll be me.

712
00:24:07,339 --> 00:24:08,908
- I hope they both fail. - This is thrilling.

713
00:24:08,909 --> 00:24:10,068
I hope they both lose.

714
00:24:10,069 --> 00:24:11,408
- Okay! - Where will you insert it?

715
00:24:11,409 --> 00:24:12,739
It's either 1 of those 2.

716
00:24:12,740 --> 00:24:14,280
- No, there are 3 holes. - There are 3?

717
00:24:14,310 --> 00:24:15,449
There are three holes.

718
00:24:15,450 --> 00:24:16,709
(Which hole is the door to victory?)

719
00:24:16,710 --> 00:24:17,848
- Please. - This is...

720
00:24:17,849 --> 00:24:19,144
very thrilling.

721
00:24:19,780 --> 00:24:20,848
Okay.

722
00:24:20,849 --> 00:24:22,789
(He inserts his sword.)

723
00:24:22,790 --> 00:24:24,059
Yes!

724
00:24:24,060 --> 00:24:25,658
(Haha wins by default.)

725
00:24:25,659 --> 00:24:27,261
I am the default winner!

726
00:24:29,030 --> 00:24:31,259
(I'm jealous.)

727
00:24:31,260 --> 00:24:32,759
Okay, then.

728
00:24:32,760 --> 00:24:34,898
Jong Kook and Se Chan will have a match.

729
00:24:34,899 --> 00:24:36,398
(These two will go against each other.)

730
00:24:36,669 --> 00:24:37,969
- These are the rubber bands. - We're using these?

731
00:24:37,970 --> 00:24:39,799
These are thick.

732
00:24:39,800 --> 00:24:40,993
My gosh.

733
00:24:41,109 --> 00:24:43,239
It's okay. I don't feel pain.

734
00:24:43,240 --> 00:24:45,321
(It's okay. I don't feel pain.)

735
00:24:45,940 --> 00:24:48,021
Please, Jong Kook. This isn't an actual war.

736
00:24:48,109 --> 00:24:50,017
It's just a Chance Card.

737
00:24:50,179 --> 00:24:51,618
- It's just a Chance Card. - It's okay.

738
00:24:51,619 --> 00:24:53,019
I don't feel pain.

739
00:24:53,020 --> 00:24:54,848
Let's decide on our positions.

740
00:24:54,849 --> 00:24:56,348
(They need to play rock-paper-scissors.)

741
00:24:56,349 --> 00:24:57,618
- Gosh. Rock-paper-scissors - Rock-paper-scissors

742
00:24:57,619 --> 00:24:59,318
(Jong Kook wins.)

743
00:24:59,319 --> 00:25:00,318
I won.

744
00:25:00,319 --> 00:25:01,858
Don't worry.

745
00:25:01,859 --> 00:25:03,259
If he attacks and gets a point,

746
00:25:03,260 --> 00:25:04,828
- you'll change positions... - I'll get a turn right?

747
00:25:04,829 --> 00:25:05,898
- and have a chance to make a tie. - Right.

748
00:25:05,899 --> 00:25:07,633
Okay. Do you want to go first?

749
00:25:07,700 --> 00:25:09,168
- No, I'll defend first. - What?

750
00:25:09,169 --> 00:25:10,199
- I want to. - Why?

751
00:25:10,200 --> 00:25:11,299
- Because I won. - Let's play rock-paper-scissors.

752
00:25:11,300 --> 00:25:12,568
- Let's do it again. - We just did.

753
00:25:12,569 --> 00:25:13,908
- When? - Just now.

754
00:25:13,909 --> 00:25:15,209
I didn't see it. The camera didn't record it.

755
00:25:15,210 --> 00:25:16,433
Right? Let's play.

756
00:25:16,609 --> 00:25:17,838
Do you want to go to a place where there are no cameras?

757
00:25:17,839 --> 00:25:19,009
Come on.

758
00:25:19,010 --> 00:25:20,338
Do you want to go to a place where there are no cameras?

759
00:25:20,339 --> 00:25:21,706
(Se Chan is terrified.)

760
00:25:21,980 --> 00:25:24,279
- Fine! We did play it! My gosh! - Right?

761
00:25:24,280 --> 00:25:25,749
We did it.

762
00:25:25,750 --> 00:25:27,586
You played scissors, and I played rock.

763
00:25:28,050 --> 00:25:29,618
Let me tell you something.

764
00:25:29,619 --> 00:25:31,323
When I was young, I could even...

765
00:25:31,389 --> 00:25:33,189
target a pen with a rubber band.

766
00:25:33,190 --> 00:25:34,259
- Really? - Yes.

767
00:25:34,260 --> 00:25:35,858
- You're good. - It was back in school.

768
00:25:35,859 --> 00:25:37,798
Look at his eyes. He's so determined.

769
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:40,285
He's intimidated. That's good.

770
00:25:41,030 --> 00:25:42,702
- Should I hit you in your knee? - Okay.

771
00:25:43,770 --> 00:25:45,401
- You're good. - Hold on.

772
00:25:46,040 --> 00:25:47,396
How about your face?

773
00:25:47,510 --> 00:25:49,071
- How does that sound? - Try it.

774
00:25:49,639 --> 00:25:51,279
Should I shoot now? Okay.

775
00:25:51,280 --> 00:25:52,279
Try it.

776
00:25:52,280 --> 00:25:53,908
(Shoot me in my face.)

777
00:25:53,909 --> 00:25:54,949
Okay.

778
00:25:54,950 --> 00:25:56,309
Se Chan pretended not to hear Jong Kook.

779
00:25:56,310 --> 00:25:57,348
(Haha is sharp.)

780
00:25:57,349 --> 00:25:59,449
(He feels guilty.)

781
00:25:59,450 --> 00:26:01,082
Come on. You could've ignored that!

782
00:26:01,119 --> 00:26:02,517
- He looked elsewhere. - Okay.

783
00:26:03,490 --> 00:26:07,459
(He needs to penetrate this sturdy defense.)

784
00:26:07,460 --> 00:26:08,551
(Shooting)

785
00:26:09,929 --> 00:26:11,969
(He misses.)

786
00:26:12,629 --> 00:26:14,159
(Haha curses at him.)

787
00:26:14,399 --> 00:26:16,199
It didn't work. I should've done this.

788
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:18,469
- We usually do this. - No, it doesn't fly out.

789
00:26:18,470 --> 00:26:19,499
That's great.

790
00:26:19,500 --> 00:26:20,769
What are you trying to do now?

791
00:26:20,770 --> 00:26:21,769
(Hold on.)

792
00:26:21,770 --> 00:26:22,994
How are you pulling it back?

793
00:26:23,069 --> 00:26:24,239
Like this.

794
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:26,338
(He's pulling back the rubber band as tight as he can.)

795
00:26:26,339 --> 00:26:27,400
You did this too.

796
00:26:27,510 --> 00:26:28,876
- Over here? - Yes.

797
00:26:29,280 --> 00:26:30,449
His looks more terrifying.

798
00:26:30,450 --> 00:26:31,449
(He's scared.)

799
00:26:31,450 --> 00:26:33,317
- Why does it look terrifying? - What's wrong?

800
00:26:33,849 --> 00:26:35,818
(He's ready.)

801
00:26:35,819 --> 00:26:37,088
Hold on.

802
00:26:37,089 --> 00:26:39,759
(Where should I shoot?)

803
00:26:39,760 --> 00:26:42,136
(Just don't shoot my body.)

804
00:26:42,429 --> 00:26:43,559
Look at his arm.

805
00:26:43,560 --> 00:26:44,759
(He focuses all his energy on his finger.)

806
00:26:44,760 --> 00:26:47,328
(It makes Se Chan dance.)

807
00:26:47,329 --> 00:26:48,758
My goodness.

808
00:26:49,230 --> 00:26:51,499
(This will be over soon.)

809
00:26:51,500 --> 00:26:53,581
(He aims and shoots.)

810
00:26:54,270 --> 00:26:55,942
(It hits his forearm.)

811
00:26:56,310 --> 00:26:59,779
(Jong Kook fails.)

812
00:26:59,780 --> 00:27:01,004
My gosh!

813
00:27:01,450 --> 00:27:04,519
It's so painful! Jong Kook!

814
00:27:04,520 --> 00:27:05,600
(It wasn't intentional.)

815
00:27:06,119 --> 00:27:08,918
(This is a real battle.)

816
00:27:08,919 --> 00:27:11,031
You did that on purpose, didn't you?

817
00:27:11,190 --> 00:27:12,459
You need to aim at the paper.

818
00:27:12,460 --> 00:27:14,328
Of course, I did.

819
00:27:14,329 --> 00:27:15,328
(They switch positions.)

820
00:27:15,329 --> 00:27:17,259
There? I hope this flies.

821
00:27:17,260 --> 00:27:18,484
(He shoots.)

822
00:27:18,929 --> 00:27:20,729
(It hits Jong Kook's lower abdomen.)

823
00:27:20,730 --> 00:27:21,769
(It's a sensitive area.)

824
00:27:21,770 --> 00:27:23,199
Okay. My turn.

825
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:25,999
He's fine.

826
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:27,979
- I was accurate. - It didn't make any noise.

827
00:27:28,669 --> 00:27:30,408
(General Kim is back.)

828
00:27:30,409 --> 00:27:32,279
It's not flying the way I want it to.

829
00:27:32,280 --> 00:27:34,648
(If Jong Kook succeeds, he'll go to the play-off.)

830
00:27:34,649 --> 00:27:36,779
Se Chan, put down everything.

831
00:27:36,780 --> 00:27:39,400
If I step forward, he won't have much space.

832
00:27:39,520 --> 00:27:42,519
But it'll hurt more.

833
00:27:42,520 --> 00:27:43,648
It will hurt more.

834
00:27:43,649 --> 00:27:46,489
(He sees Jong Kook's fingers.)

835
00:27:46,490 --> 00:27:48,978
(Dance all you want, you fool.)

836
00:27:49,060 --> 00:27:52,466
I don't think he's aiming at the paper door.

837
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:54,499
(Just watching him terrifies Haha.)

838
00:27:54,500 --> 00:27:55,499
I hate this.

839
00:27:55,500 --> 00:27:56,928
(The sound is intense.)

840
00:27:56,929 --> 00:27:57,960
What?

841
00:27:58,569 --> 00:27:59,589
Okay.

842
00:28:00,909 --> 00:28:02,209
(It hits the paper.)

843
00:28:02,210 --> 00:28:03,668
(Jong Kook succeeds.)

844
00:28:04,010 --> 00:28:05,009
Okay.

845
00:28:05,010 --> 00:28:07,009
(He aims at the available space...)

846
00:28:07,010 --> 00:28:10,309
(and penetrates the paper door.)

847
00:28:10,310 --> 00:28:13,513
(He crushes the paper.)

848
00:28:13,780 --> 00:28:15,489
I got hit with that!

849
00:28:15,490 --> 00:28:18,918
(Did it hurt a lot?)

850
00:28:18,919 --> 00:28:20,259
That's great.

851
00:28:20,260 --> 00:28:22,189
(Jong Kook goes to the play-off.)

852
00:28:22,190 --> 00:28:24,759
- Okay. - I hate winning by default!

853
00:28:24,760 --> 00:28:26,658
- That's great. - Jong Kook...

854
00:28:26,659 --> 00:28:28,333
- wins. - Okay!

855
00:28:28,730 --> 00:28:29,828
You need to succeed.

856
00:28:29,829 --> 00:28:31,039
I need to.

857
00:28:31,040 --> 00:28:32,365
(Haha is in the offense.)

858
00:28:33,270 --> 00:28:34,269
(He carefully chooses his weapon.)

859
00:28:34,270 --> 00:28:36,921
Get one that looks taut. Okay?

860
00:28:38,780 --> 00:28:40,039
(He picks one.)

861
00:28:40,040 --> 00:28:41,171
Let's do this!

862
00:28:42,579 --> 00:28:46,803
(Haha is no rookie.)

863
00:28:47,520 --> 00:28:50,549
(During practice time,)

864
00:28:50,550 --> 00:28:52,918
(he was just as good as Jong Kook.)

865
00:28:52,919 --> 00:28:54,562
(I can do this.)

866
00:28:55,329 --> 00:28:59,828
(He focuses all his energy on his fingers.)

867
00:28:59,829 --> 00:29:00,828
Do it.

868
00:29:00,829 --> 00:29:03,685
(Will he be able to penetrate this sturdy fortress?)

869
00:29:04,440 --> 00:29:06,714
Graze his skin, please.

870
00:29:07,740 --> 00:29:08,739
Okay.

871
00:29:08,740 --> 00:29:09,739
(The tension is high.)

872
00:29:09,740 --> 00:29:11,838
(Will he block successfully, or will he penetrate successfully?)

873
00:29:11,839 --> 00:29:13,339
Shoot it.

874
00:29:13,740 --> 00:29:14,749
Good.

875
00:29:14,750 --> 00:29:15,749
(He attempts to throw him into confusion...)

876
00:29:15,750 --> 00:29:18,197
(and then fires.)

877
00:29:19,079 --> 00:29:20,549
(Jong Kook blocks it.)

878
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:23,740
Okay!

879
00:29:24,159 --> 00:29:25,189
Move.

880
00:29:25,190 --> 00:29:27,127
(Did he just block it?)

881
00:29:27,319 --> 00:29:28,328
(If Jong Kook wins, it's game over.)

882
00:29:28,329 --> 00:29:30,029
The one who wins in this match...

883
00:29:30,030 --> 00:29:31,529
will acquire a Chance Card.

884
00:29:31,530 --> 00:29:32,828
- There are no more chances? - Okay.

885
00:29:32,829 --> 00:29:34,499
This is the final play-off.

886
00:29:34,500 --> 00:29:37,269
(Will Haha block successfully?)

887
00:29:37,270 --> 00:29:38,368
(If I block this, it'll be my turn again.)

888
00:29:38,369 --> 00:29:40,269
From my experience,

889
00:29:40,270 --> 00:29:43,239
you need to give him no space. You need to come forward.

890
00:29:43,240 --> 00:29:44,239
Right.

891
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:45,566
You need to move around.

892
00:29:45,940 --> 00:29:46,960
Come here.

893
00:29:47,649 --> 00:29:48,700
Come here.

894
00:29:49,050 --> 00:29:50,049
All right.

895
00:29:50,050 --> 00:29:51,610
(Jong Kook gets ready to fire.)

896
00:29:52,149 --> 00:29:53,272
Wait, wait, wait!

897
00:29:54,690 --> 00:29:57,515
(Haha suffers from the aftereffects of Jong Kook's fingers.)

898
00:29:58,290 --> 00:29:59,358
(I'll let you live.)

899
00:29:59,359 --> 00:30:00,858
Hurry up.

900
00:30:01,129 --> 00:30:02,628
(He gets into the defense position.)

901
00:30:02,629 --> 00:30:04,128
There's space below. Good.

902
00:30:04,659 --> 00:30:06,729
There's a lot of space around you. Move your arms.

903
00:30:06,730 --> 00:30:08,606
Put them to the side. Good.

904
00:30:09,669 --> 00:30:10,689
Good.

905
00:30:12,099 --> 00:30:14,894
Okay. Gosh, this is taut.

906
00:30:15,440 --> 00:30:16,638
It's so tight.

907
00:30:16,639 --> 00:30:17,863
(He charges his weapon.)

908
00:30:18,210 --> 00:30:21,473
(Where should I aim this time?)

909
00:30:22,349 --> 00:30:23,778
(Terrified)

910
00:30:24,079 --> 00:30:26,618
(If Jong Kook succeeds, he'll be the final winner.)

911
00:30:26,619 --> 00:30:29,489
(Will Haha block successfully, or will Jong Kook get the victory?)

912
00:30:29,490 --> 00:30:30,918
(While he flails his arms around,)

913
00:30:30,919 --> 00:30:32,918
(Jong Kook fires.)

914
00:30:32,919 --> 00:30:34,867
(What is the result?)

915
00:30:36,359 --> 00:30:37,628
(The paper is torn.)

916
00:30:37,629 --> 00:30:39,669
(Jong Kook succeeds.)

917
00:30:41,530 --> 00:30:43,128
Where? Where did it go?

918
00:30:43,129 --> 00:30:44,873
- It went through. - He penetrated it.

919
00:30:45,569 --> 00:30:46,864
(Darn it.)

920
00:30:47,240 --> 00:30:49,568
He's way too strong compared to us.

921
00:30:49,569 --> 00:30:52,466
Okay! That's great! You're both weaklings.

922
00:30:52,740 --> 00:30:54,408
So why did you pick War?

923
00:30:54,409 --> 00:30:56,143
(He performs a victory ceremony.)

924
00:30:56,349 --> 00:30:58,318
Didn't he just try to wage war?

925
00:30:58,319 --> 00:30:59,370
What?

926
00:30:59,579 --> 00:31:00,578
(So what?)

927
00:31:00,579 --> 00:31:01,609
You look charismatic.

928
00:31:02,319 --> 00:31:05,259
Do you want to do this? You need to do it.

929
00:31:05,260 --> 00:31:06,646
Go and throw it.

930
00:31:07,119 --> 00:31:08,229
- Try it. - Throw it.

931
00:31:08,230 --> 00:31:09,289
Have this.

932
00:31:09,290 --> 00:31:11,676
(This is my gift to you.)

933
00:31:12,099 --> 00:31:13,690
(Thanks)

934
00:31:14,169 --> 00:31:16,469
- Did Jong Kook win? - Okay.

935
00:31:16,470 --> 00:31:18,469
This is so unfair.

936
00:31:18,470 --> 00:31:19,490
(Jong Kook obtains a Chance Card.)

937
00:31:19,569 --> 00:31:23,385
Jae Seok and So Min will go to the play-off.

938
00:31:23,740 --> 00:31:25,239
- They're the final contestants? - It feels great.

939
00:31:25,240 --> 00:31:26,908
- My gosh. - This is unbelievable.

940
00:31:26,909 --> 00:31:28,479
- My pride is hurt. - This is why it's worth...

941
00:31:28,480 --> 00:31:31,049
coming here though the four of us are here.

942
00:31:31,050 --> 00:31:32,719
- Exactly. - This is the land of opportunity.

943
00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:34,618
Okay. The final winner...

944
00:31:34,619 --> 00:31:37,507
will be determined by a game of Line the Coins.

945
00:31:37,720 --> 00:31:40,035
- "Line the Coins"? - "Line the Coins"?

946
00:31:40,460 --> 00:31:41,888
The one who puts their coin...

947
00:31:41,889 --> 00:31:44,613
the closest to the line is the winner.

948
00:31:45,129 --> 00:31:46,628
This is the Coke and Sprite Game.

949
00:31:46,629 --> 00:31:48,027
You need to hit hard.

950
00:31:48,369 --> 00:31:50,029
- This means... - You win.

951
00:31:50,030 --> 00:31:51,598
(So Min's is closer to the line.)

952
00:31:51,599 --> 00:31:53,884
- You won that round. - I think I can win.

953
00:31:54,409 --> 00:31:55,491
Gosh.

954
00:31:56,369 --> 00:31:57,638
Here I go. Start.

955
00:31:57,639 --> 00:31:58,908
- Are you starting now? - You need to say, "start".

956
00:31:58,909 --> 00:32:01,093
(Their practice time is over.)

957
00:32:01,310 --> 00:32:02,330
Start!

958
00:32:02,679 --> 00:32:03,848
- He's starting. - Already?

959
00:32:03,849 --> 00:32:05,247
(How will Jae Seok do?)

960
00:32:05,550 --> 00:32:06,570
(Flicking)

961
00:32:08,889 --> 00:32:11,559
(His coin is almost at the line.)

962
00:32:11,560 --> 00:32:12,989
Gosh, I should've hit harder.

963
00:32:12,990 --> 00:32:14,289
(He's disappointed.)

964
00:32:14,290 --> 00:32:16,125
I should've hit harder.

965
00:32:16,530 --> 00:32:18,098
I should've put more strength into it.

966
00:32:18,099 --> 00:32:19,559
- You just need to pass this. - Well...

967
00:32:19,629 --> 00:32:20,680
Start.

968
00:32:21,899 --> 00:32:26,338
(If So Min's coin gets closer to the line than his, she wins.)

969
00:32:26,339 --> 00:32:28,039
(What will be the outcome?)

970
00:32:28,040 --> 00:32:29,805
I'm a bit concerned.

971
00:32:30,139 --> 00:32:33,474
(If the coin falls, it's a miss. Where did the coin go?)

972
00:32:34,450 --> 00:32:36,958
(She gets it right on the line.)

973
00:32:37,720 --> 00:32:39,019
(It shoots straight out and stops on the line.)

974
00:32:39,020 --> 00:32:40,957
- She won. - I won.

975
00:32:41,520 --> 00:32:44,070
I just won. What should we do?

976
00:32:44,619 --> 00:32:45,818
- This is unbelievable. - It's on the line.

977
00:32:45,819 --> 00:32:47,418
- It went on the line. - My goodness.

978
00:32:47,419 --> 00:32:49,128
No one can beat her.

979
00:32:49,129 --> 00:32:50,997
Mine went on the line. Goodness.

980
00:32:51,530 --> 00:32:53,499
Oh, my. I just won.

981
00:32:53,530 --> 00:32:55,467
(She gloats.)

982
00:32:55,829 --> 00:32:57,568
So Min wins.

983
00:32:57,569 --> 00:32:59,568
(So Min is the winner on this land of opportunity.)

984
00:32:59,569 --> 00:33:02,509
- It's understandable that she won. - Right.

985
00:33:02,510 --> 00:33:04,039
- It's only here where she can win. - This is where...

986
00:33:04,040 --> 00:33:05,774
- she can win. - It's the land of opportunity.

987
00:33:05,940 --> 00:33:07,309
This is the only place...

988
00:33:07,310 --> 00:33:09,009
- My gosh. - where she can win.

989
00:33:09,010 --> 00:33:10,581
I was happy to have been up against them.

990
00:33:11,319 --> 00:33:12,348
- All right. - Thank you.

991
00:33:12,349 --> 00:33:14,318
So Min, the final winner,

992
00:33:14,319 --> 00:33:18,388
will now pick 1 of the 3 Chance Cards.

993
00:33:18,389 --> 00:33:20,019
- She needs to pick? - Do I need to pick one?

994
00:33:20,020 --> 00:33:21,989
- Let them pick first. - You can pick first,

995
00:33:21,990 --> 00:33:23,417
and I'll get the one remaining.

996
00:33:23,629 --> 00:33:25,568
- You two can pick first. - My gosh.

997
00:33:25,929 --> 00:33:27,729
- She's using us. - It doesn't feel that good.

998
00:33:27,730 --> 00:33:29,328
I think the last one will be good.

999
00:33:29,329 --> 00:33:30,529
They're all unlucky.

1000
00:33:30,530 --> 00:33:33,138
Pick one each. Which one will you pick?

1001
00:33:33,139 --> 00:33:35,009
Then I'll pick this one. Okay.

1002
00:33:35,010 --> 00:33:36,138
(She picks the last one.)

1003
00:33:36,139 --> 00:33:38,309
- I'll pick this one. - Share it with me.

1004
00:33:38,310 --> 00:33:39,309
(What kinds of Chance Cards have they picked?)

1005
00:33:39,310 --> 00:33:40,840
- Is it good? - It's a very good one.

1006
00:33:40,950 --> 00:33:42,078
It's an excellent one.

1007
00:33:42,079 --> 00:33:43,609
(Their first missions come to an end.)

1008
00:33:43,849 --> 00:33:46,909
- This is your second mission. - Okay.

1009
00:33:47,250 --> 00:33:49,618
While governing, Sejong the Great...

1010
00:33:49,619 --> 00:33:53,495
listened to the minority's opinions as well.

1011
00:33:53,720 --> 00:33:56,029
Your second mission is called The Minority's Dignity.

1012
00:33:56,030 --> 00:33:57,928
- I like this. - Yes.

1013
00:33:57,929 --> 00:34:00,928
Sejong the Great's favorite dish was meat.

1014
00:34:00,929 --> 00:34:03,368
There are two dishes that go well with meat.

1015
00:34:03,369 --> 00:34:05,888
They're cold buckwheat noodles and mixed buckwheat noodles.

1016
00:34:06,500 --> 00:34:07,499
(They need to make a choice.)

1017
00:34:07,500 --> 00:34:10,638
The one who picks the least popular one wins, right?

1018
00:34:10,639 --> 00:34:15,649
The restaurant with the least number of members in the given time...

1019
00:34:15,650 --> 00:34:18,149
will be given Chance Cards and Meal Cards.

1020
00:34:18,150 --> 00:34:20,649
The restaurant with the majority of the members will not get to eat.

1021
00:34:20,650 --> 00:34:22,988
They will also be flogged.

1022
00:34:22,989 --> 00:34:24,019
We'll be flogged?

1023
00:34:24,020 --> 00:34:25,118
What did we do so wrong?

1024
00:34:25,119 --> 00:34:27,058
- We're flogged every week. - Why would you use violence?

1025
00:34:27,759 --> 00:34:29,129
- Which one should I pick? - Let's see.

1026
00:34:29,130 --> 00:34:31,258
Let me be completely honest.

1027
00:34:31,259 --> 00:34:33,880
I'm really craving cold buckwheat noodles.

1028
00:34:34,130 --> 00:34:35,328
- I do. - Me too.

1029
00:34:35,329 --> 00:34:36,900
I also want cold buckwheat noodles.

1030
00:34:37,029 --> 00:34:39,298
- Then... - I'm just going to go with that.

1031
00:34:39,299 --> 00:34:40,339
(Haha tries to act tough.)

1032
00:34:40,340 --> 00:34:41,669
(He begins his macho act.)

1033
00:34:41,670 --> 00:34:43,638
- Haha. - I...

1034
00:34:43,639 --> 00:34:44,839
- I'm sick of these scenarios. - What?

1035
00:34:44,840 --> 00:34:46,738
- I'm really tired of this. - Me too.

1036
00:34:46,739 --> 00:34:48,649
- That's why I'm going to be simple. - I'm going to go with the cold one.

1037
00:34:48,650 --> 00:34:49,848
- I already told you. - I'm going to go as well.

1038
00:34:49,849 --> 00:34:52,249
- I'm going. - Sure, you can come.

1039
00:34:52,250 --> 00:34:54,432
- Let's play rock-paper-scissors. - Whoever loses...

1040
00:34:54,489 --> 00:34:56,718
will be told where to go.

1041
00:34:56,719 --> 00:34:58,319
- Okay. - They'll have to obey us.

1042
00:34:58,320 --> 00:35:00,462
Then let's play a Race of Wits.

1043
00:35:00,719 --> 00:35:02,289
The last one or the one that overlaps with another...

1044
00:35:02,290 --> 00:35:04,028
- will be told where to go. - They have to.

1045
00:35:04,029 --> 00:35:05,499
- They must. - You have to obey.

1046
00:35:05,500 --> 00:35:06,499
- You must. - All right.

1047
00:35:06,500 --> 00:35:07,729
If you don't, you'll get disqualified.

1048
00:35:07,730 --> 00:35:08,769
- Okay? - Okay.

1049
00:35:08,770 --> 00:35:10,428
- You have to go. - There are no exceptions.

1050
00:35:10,429 --> 00:35:11,797
Ready, set, go.

1051
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:12,999
- 1. - 2.

1052
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:14,437
(Seok Jin grunts.)

1053
00:35:16,009 --> 00:35:17,029
(Grunting)

1054
00:35:19,040 --> 00:35:21,649
He grunted.

1055
00:35:21,650 --> 00:35:23,139
(He hates this game.)

1056
00:35:23,409 --> 00:35:25,919
What was that?

1057
00:35:25,920 --> 00:35:26,919
Jong Kook will choose...

1058
00:35:26,920 --> 00:35:27,919
- cold buckwheat noodles. - Hey.

1059
00:35:27,920 --> 00:35:29,319
- That's for sure. - He will choose that...

1060
00:35:29,320 --> 00:35:31,718
- For sure. - regardless of the game.

1061
00:35:31,719 --> 00:35:32,919
- "I don't care. I'm having it." - Seok Jin will go there.

1062
00:35:32,920 --> 00:35:34,218
- "I don't care." - He'll go there.

1063
00:35:34,219 --> 00:35:36,028
Okay. Seok Jin will go wherever Jong Kook goes.

1064
00:35:36,029 --> 00:35:37,828
- You're set. - Let's send one more there.

1065
00:35:37,829 --> 00:35:39,528
- Okay. - You're not going there?

1066
00:35:39,529 --> 00:35:40,828
- No, we're not. - Me neither.

1067
00:35:40,829 --> 00:35:43,528
How about we make two of the staff members play...

1068
00:35:43,529 --> 00:35:45,198
rock-paper-scissors...

1069
00:35:45,199 --> 00:35:46,738
- and guess who won? - Let's pick.

1070
00:35:46,739 --> 00:35:47,839
- Okay. - I like that.

1071
00:35:47,840 --> 00:35:48,930
- All right. - Okay.

1072
00:35:49,210 --> 00:35:51,109
- So Hyun. - Hyo Im and So Hyun can go.

1073
00:35:51,110 --> 00:35:52,539
- Yes. - We'll turn our backs.

1074
00:35:52,540 --> 00:35:53,560
(They won't look.)

1075
00:35:53,710 --> 00:35:54,800
I wonder who'll win.

1076
00:35:55,279 --> 00:35:56,709
Rock-paper-scissors

1077
00:35:56,710 --> 00:35:58,218
(They need to study their faces.)

1078
00:35:58,219 --> 00:35:59,505
- Are you done? - Are you done?

1079
00:36:00,119 --> 00:36:01,919
- Pick. - Look at their faces.

1080
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:03,143
(They study their faces.)

1081
00:36:04,659 --> 00:36:07,218
- Hey. - I'm so confused.

1082
00:36:07,219 --> 00:36:08,528
- I pick So Hyun. - Pick.

1083
00:36:08,529 --> 00:36:09,888
- I pick So Hyun. - Who?

1084
00:36:09,889 --> 00:36:11,123
Then go towards that side.

1085
00:36:11,829 --> 00:36:13,459
- I pick Hyo Im. - Hyo Im?

1086
00:36:13,460 --> 00:36:15,306
- Yes. - I pick her too.

1087
00:36:15,400 --> 00:36:16,399
I think...

1088
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:18,276
- I pick So Hyun. - Hyo Im has beaten So Hyun.

1089
00:36:19,639 --> 00:36:20,691
What's the result?

1090
00:36:21,340 --> 00:36:22,799
The winner of the game was...

1091
00:36:23,110 --> 00:36:24,109
Yang Hyo Im.

1092
00:36:24,110 --> 00:36:25,138
- Okay! - Okay!

1093
00:36:25,139 --> 00:36:26,138
(Kwang Soo and Jae Seok are correct.)

1094
00:36:26,139 --> 00:36:28,249
- You'll both go there! - Yes, you will.

1095
00:36:28,250 --> 00:36:30,749
Hold. If Jong Kook goes as well, there will be...

1096
00:36:30,750 --> 00:36:31,848
three people there.

1097
00:36:31,849 --> 00:36:33,991
- Right. - Jae Seok.

1098
00:36:34,219 --> 00:36:35,249
Let's have another match.

1099
00:36:35,250 --> 00:36:36,371
(Jae Seok! Let's have another match.)

1100
00:36:36,520 --> 00:36:38,618
- What did you say? - Let's have one last round.

1101
00:36:38,619 --> 00:36:39,639
(Kwang Soo makes a tempting offer.)

1102
00:36:40,219 --> 00:36:41,559
Yes, it's better to send...

1103
00:36:41,560 --> 00:36:43,428
- three people there. - It will be better.

1104
00:36:43,429 --> 00:36:46,028
- We should send three from here. - It will be better.

1105
00:36:46,029 --> 00:36:47,129
I will get a better chance of winning if I win again.

1106
00:36:47,130 --> 00:36:48,129
That's right.

1107
00:36:48,130 --> 00:36:49,368
You have to keep the promise.

1108
00:36:49,369 --> 00:36:50,399
- Let's play rock-paper-scissors. - Rock-paper-scissors?

1109
00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:52,276
- The loser must go with us. - Just one game?

1110
00:36:52,400 --> 00:36:53,461
One game.

1111
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:56,073
If I lose here, I'm done for.

1112
00:36:56,110 --> 00:36:57,844
- My last chance. - Let's go!

1113
00:36:57,880 --> 00:36:58,961
Rock-paper-scissors!

1114
00:36:59,940 --> 00:37:03,209
(Kwang Soo wins, Jae Seok has to go with cold buckwheat noodle.)

1115
00:37:03,210 --> 00:37:04,300
Yes!

1116
00:37:04,380 --> 00:37:05,470
I might win.

1117
00:37:05,480 --> 00:37:06,775
What if...

1118
00:37:06,849 --> 00:37:08,583
we went with cold buckwheat noodle,

1119
00:37:08,619 --> 00:37:10,048
but we win?

1120
00:37:10,349 --> 00:37:11,658
- There's no way. - That would be funny.

1121
00:37:11,659 --> 00:37:13,658
- There's no way. - That would be hilarious.

1122
00:37:13,659 --> 00:37:15,159
There are only two choices. It's impossible.

1123
00:37:15,489 --> 00:37:17,028
- It could be four to four. - Let's go.

1124
00:37:17,029 --> 00:37:18,658
- Let's go. - We never know.

1125
00:37:18,659 --> 00:37:20,229
- We never know - But...

1126
00:37:20,230 --> 00:37:21,525
(What will be the fate of Kwang Soo and the 3 losers?)

1127
00:37:21,730 --> 00:37:23,069
Are we going to have cold buckwheat noodles, then?

1128
00:37:23,070 --> 00:37:24,368
- Yes, - We have no other choice.

1129
00:37:24,369 --> 00:37:25,461
But I think...

1130
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:27,835
we shouldn't call the others...

1131
00:37:28,270 --> 00:37:30,209
and just surprise them on the spot.

1132
00:37:30,210 --> 00:37:31,238
- I think that will be better. - How does that sound?

1133
00:37:31,239 --> 00:37:32,379
Jae Seok...

1134
00:37:32,380 --> 00:37:33,939
- Yes? - To be honest,

1135
00:37:33,940 --> 00:37:35,714
- I like that better than winning. - Right?

1136
00:37:35,980 --> 00:37:36,979
Don't call them.

1137
00:37:36,980 --> 00:37:38,548
- Let's not tell them. - Okay.

1138
00:37:38,549 --> 00:37:40,948
- This isn't just any car. - It's a bomb.

1139
00:37:40,949 --> 00:37:42,319
- It's a bomb. - An atom bomb.

1140
00:37:42,320 --> 00:37:46,094
- The fusing is burning away. - It's a bomb.

1141
00:37:46,219 --> 00:37:48,300
- Let's go blast this bomb! - Yes!

1142
00:37:49,460 --> 00:37:52,459
(1st location, the cold buckwheat noodle restaurant.)

1143
00:37:52,960 --> 00:37:57,368
(The noodles that cool you down just by looking at it.)

1144
00:37:57,369 --> 00:38:00,198
(Ji Hyo enters first.)

1145
00:38:00,199 --> 00:38:03,868
(Ji Hyo, who's usually lucky, chose cold buckwheat noodles?)

1146
00:38:03,869 --> 00:38:05,078
No one is here yet?

1147
00:38:05,079 --> 00:38:06,335
No one arrived.

1148
00:38:06,509 --> 00:38:07,702
Please don't come here.

1149
00:38:08,079 --> 00:38:09,099
Please.

1150
00:38:09,650 --> 00:38:12,985
We discussed this once before,

1151
00:38:13,549 --> 00:38:16,375
and Jae Seok said that he liked spicy buckwheat noodles,

1152
00:38:16,389 --> 00:38:18,664
while Jong Kook said he liked cold buckwheat noodles.

1153
00:38:19,119 --> 00:38:20,388
(That's right. Jong Kook, who likes cold buckwheat noodles, enters.)

1154
00:38:20,389 --> 00:38:22,089
It smells good,

1155
00:38:22,090 --> 00:38:23,328
but I don't know if I'll be able to eat it.

1156
00:38:23,329 --> 00:38:24,459
(Talk of the devil...)

1157
00:38:24,460 --> 00:38:25,521
That sounds like Jong Kook.

1158
00:38:25,645 --> 00:38:28,845
<font color="#fcc89b">[VIU Ver] SBS E451 Running Man</font>

<font color="#ff5fa2">-♥ Ruo Xi ♥-</font>

1159
00:38:28,900 --> 00:38:30,129
I knew it.

1160
00:38:30,130 --> 00:38:31,129
(Jong Kook enters the cold buckwheat noodle restaurant.)

1161
00:38:31,130 --> 00:38:34,069
(His preference never changes.)

1162
00:38:34,070 --> 00:38:35,709
You have to be the last one.

1163
00:38:35,710 --> 00:38:37,368
It's just the two of you until now.

1164
00:38:37,369 --> 00:38:38,461
(2 people are at cold buckwheat noodles. How about the rest?)

1165
00:38:39,210 --> 00:38:42,311
(2nd location, the spicy buckwheat noodle restaurant.)

1166
00:38:43,049 --> 00:38:44,848
(Haha, who preferred cold buckwheat noodles, is here?)

1167
00:38:44,849 --> 00:38:46,308
No one's here yet!

1168
00:38:46,549 --> 00:38:48,018
No one's here yet.

1169
00:38:49,690 --> 00:38:50,948
Awesome!

1170
00:38:50,949 --> 00:38:51,959
(Am I the only one? Awesome!)

1171
00:38:51,960 --> 00:38:53,218
(It's a good thing I changed it to the spicy buckwheat noodles.)

1172
00:38:53,219 --> 00:38:54,280
Awesome!

1173
00:38:55,460 --> 00:38:56,613
Why, you...

1174
00:38:56,860 --> 00:38:58,155
- Great. No one is here. - Why, you...

1175
00:38:58,529 --> 00:39:00,162
Come on.

1176
00:39:00,599 --> 00:39:02,928
- You are just... - Come on.

1177
00:39:02,929 --> 00:39:05,098
You said you were going to choose the cold buckwheat noodles!

1178
00:39:05,099 --> 00:39:06,439
You said you had an upset stomach!

1179
00:39:06,440 --> 00:39:08,008
You said you were going to choose cold buckwheat noodles...

1180
00:39:08,009 --> 00:39:09,669
and I said I'll choose spicy buckwheat noodles!

1181
00:39:09,670 --> 00:39:12,393
- I hope no one else comes. - Please...

1182
00:39:12,509 --> 00:39:14,581
Jae Seok will come here, for sure.

1183
00:39:14,610 --> 00:39:16,037
I think he could go the other way, though.

1184
00:39:16,210 --> 00:39:17,508
Someone else is here!

1185
00:39:17,509 --> 00:39:18,978
(Someone else is here!)

1186
00:39:19,279 --> 00:39:22,176
(Another car arrived at the spicy buckwheat noodle restaurant?)

1187
00:39:22,989 --> 00:39:24,112
No!

1188
00:39:24,449 --> 00:39:25,510
Don't come here!

1189
00:39:25,560 --> 00:39:26,815
- Who is it? - Please!

1190
00:39:28,130 --> 00:39:29,258
You really came here?

1191
00:39:29,259 --> 00:39:30,657
(The unlucky Kwang Soo is here.)

1192
00:39:30,829 --> 00:39:31,928
You really came here?

1193
00:39:31,929 --> 00:39:33,258
- You really came here? - Come on!

1194
00:39:33,259 --> 00:39:34,298
(Adding Kwang Soo to the spicy buckwheat noodle restaurant.)

1195
00:39:34,299 --> 00:39:36,135
You guys usually go for cold buckwheat noodles!

1196
00:39:36,829 --> 00:39:37,921
Kwang Soo.

1197
00:39:38,599 --> 00:39:40,298
What's wrong with you?

1198
00:39:40,299 --> 00:39:41,636
I need to tell you something.

1199
00:39:42,040 --> 00:39:43,498
There were four of us...

1200
00:39:43,869 --> 00:39:46,209
and Jae Seok, Seok Jin, and So Min went to the spicy buckwheat noodles.

1201
00:39:46,210 --> 00:39:47,238
I mean, cold buckwheat noodles.

1202
00:39:47,239 --> 00:39:48,578
- Are you sure? How do you know? - Yes.

1203
00:39:48,579 --> 00:39:50,048
Because we played a game...

1204
00:39:50,049 --> 00:39:51,948
- and I won. - Ji Hyo changed her mind.

1205
00:39:51,949 --> 00:39:53,548
- She went for the cold. - She told me that too.

1206
00:39:53,549 --> 00:39:54,919
Jong Kook went there, for sure.

1207
00:39:54,920 --> 00:39:57,019
Since the three of us are here, it depends on Ji Hyo.

1208
00:39:57,020 --> 00:39:58,359
The last time Jae Seok called,

1209
00:39:58,360 --> 00:39:59,685
he said, "We changed our minds."

1210
00:40:00,460 --> 00:40:01,729
- He can't do that. - He said they're on their way.

1211
00:40:01,730 --> 00:40:02,729
But that can't be happening.

1212
00:40:02,730 --> 00:40:04,528
(During the phone call with Jae Seok a while ago...)

1213
00:40:04,529 --> 00:40:05,989
Kwang Soo, where are you headed?

1214
00:40:06,199 --> 00:40:07,598
I'm almost there.

1215
00:40:07,599 --> 00:40:08,854
- Kwang Soo. - Yes?

1216
00:40:09,130 --> 00:40:10,669
We thought about it, and I think we've changed our minds.

1217
00:40:10,670 --> 00:40:11,690
(Confident)

1218
00:40:11,900 --> 00:40:13,633
Don't play with me.

1219
00:40:14,040 --> 00:40:15,309
We're going for the spicy buckwheat noodles.

1220
00:40:15,310 --> 00:40:16,569
Stop it.

1221
00:40:16,570 --> 00:40:18,138
We just feel that way.

1222
00:40:18,139 --> 00:40:19,709
It just happened,

1223
00:40:19,710 --> 00:40:21,106
so you decide. I don't know anymore.

1224
00:40:21,179 --> 00:40:22,278
We're going for the spicy buckwheat noodles.

1225
00:40:22,279 --> 00:40:23,574
- Bye! - Jae Seok.

1226
00:40:23,880 --> 00:40:24,970
Fine!

1227
00:40:25,579 --> 00:40:27,348
(The bomb car decided to blow up...)

1228
00:40:27,349 --> 00:40:28,488
It's impossible.

1229
00:40:28,489 --> 00:40:30,089
Don't you think something's wrong, Haha?

1230
00:40:30,090 --> 00:40:32,334
Kwang Soo is here...

1231
00:40:32,619 --> 00:40:34,319
If they don't arrive in time,

1232
00:40:34,320 --> 00:40:35,488
- they're... - They'll be disqualified.

1233
00:40:35,489 --> 00:40:36,784
- It's their own fault. - Right.

1234
00:40:37,929 --> 00:40:38,981
What?

1235
00:40:39,659 --> 00:40:40,928
(Just then,)

1236
00:40:40,929 --> 00:40:43,215
(a woman's voice is heard outside!)

1237
00:40:44,369 --> 00:40:45,468
Do you usually like cold buckwheat noodles?

1238
00:40:45,469 --> 00:40:46,622
I always eat the cold one.

1239
00:40:47,940 --> 00:40:49,265
What? Someone's here!

1240
00:40:50,110 --> 00:40:53,609
(Is someone else here?)

1241
00:40:55,349 --> 00:40:57,247
- Why is there a camera? - There's a camera out there!

1242
00:40:57,650 --> 00:40:59,455
No! Come on!

1243
00:41:00,750 --> 00:41:01,912
The car turned away!

1244
00:41:02,290 --> 00:41:03,348
It a U-turn!

1245
00:41:03,349 --> 00:41:05,988
(The filming crew for another show goes in a different direction.)

1246
00:41:05,989 --> 00:41:07,519
(It was a U-turn!)

1247
00:41:07,520 --> 00:41:08,828
U-turn! U-turn!

1248
00:41:08,829 --> 00:41:10,658
- U-turn! - Why did they come this way?

1249
00:41:10,659 --> 00:41:12,945
Why are there so many vans that look like that in our country?

1250
00:41:13,460 --> 00:41:14,899
(While the cowards were being frightened...)

1251
00:41:14,900 --> 00:41:16,328
(in the spicy buckwheat noodles...)

1252
00:41:16,329 --> 00:41:17,697
(Knocking)

1253
00:41:18,799 --> 00:41:19,939
Right.

1254
00:41:19,940 --> 00:41:21,908
I knew it was a girl.

1255
00:41:22,340 --> 00:41:23,868
(What?)

1256
00:41:23,869 --> 00:41:25,209
(You're not...)

1257
00:41:25,210 --> 00:41:27,209
(here alone?)

1258
00:41:27,210 --> 00:41:28,309
Goodness.

1259
00:41:28,310 --> 00:41:29,609
(Cold buckwheat noodles lost, thanks to the three bombs.)

1260
00:41:29,610 --> 00:41:31,517
There were two people here.

1261
00:41:31,980 --> 00:41:34,019
- Ji Hyo, why do you look like that? - I see...

1262
00:41:34,020 --> 00:41:35,689
- So this is what happened? - I had no idea.

1263
00:41:35,690 --> 00:41:37,179
You guys aren't usually...

1264
00:41:37,250 --> 00:41:38,519
this obedient.

1265
00:41:38,520 --> 00:41:40,888
Well, rules are rules.

1266
00:41:40,889 --> 00:41:43,072
- The three of us... - Since when?

1267
00:41:43,759 --> 00:41:45,129
(They have never heard of them being so obedient.)

1268
00:41:45,130 --> 00:41:46,428
- Gosh. - We thought about it a lot.

1269
00:41:46,429 --> 00:41:48,428
- Since when? - We did think about it a lot.

1270
00:41:48,429 --> 00:41:51,356
Unbelievable. You usually do what you want to do.

1271
00:41:51,699 --> 00:41:53,368
So does that mean...

1272
00:41:53,369 --> 00:41:54,908
They're going to be enjoying it so much.

1273
00:41:54,909 --> 00:41:57,184
They must be screaming with joy.

1274
00:41:57,909 --> 00:42:00,326
(Correct.)

1275
00:42:00,579 --> 00:42:02,578
(The spicy buckwheat noodles trio unites.)

1276
00:42:02,579 --> 00:42:04,651
Ji Hyo went for the other one.

1277
00:42:05,219 --> 00:42:06,239
Nice!

1278
00:42:06,849 --> 00:42:08,589
I didn't even keep my hopes up...

1279
00:42:08,590 --> 00:42:10,319
after seeing these two.

1280
00:42:10,320 --> 00:42:11,717
Please serve us the food.

1281
00:42:12,119 --> 00:42:13,487
- Gosh. - Gosh.

1282
00:42:14,190 --> 00:42:16,028
- Thank you. - Do we get one each?

1283
00:42:16,029 --> 00:42:17,488
(The grilled barbecue bulgogi and chewy spicy buckwheat noodles.)

1284
00:42:17,489 --> 00:42:18,755
Gosh.

1285
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:20,081
Thank you for the meal!

1286
00:42:20,860 --> 00:42:24,338
(He slurps it up without a word.)

1287
00:42:24,630 --> 00:42:26,839
(The chopsticks move around constantly.)

1288
00:42:26,840 --> 00:42:27,992
It's so good.

1289
00:42:28,139 --> 00:42:31,339
(He regrets even thinking about going for cold buckwheat noodles.)

1290
00:42:31,340 --> 00:42:33,008
- The sweet and sour taste is good. - Sure.

1291
00:42:33,009 --> 00:42:34,234
(The winners get the sweet and sour taste of the noodles.)

1292
00:42:34,279 --> 00:42:35,809
Instead of a meal,

1293
00:42:35,810 --> 00:42:38,124
you will get flogged with a stick.

1294
00:42:38,150 --> 00:42:39,618
All of a sudden? Right here?

1295
00:42:39,619 --> 00:42:41,312
But we didn't even do anything wrong.

1296
00:42:41,349 --> 00:42:43,359
You will have to get...

1297
00:42:43,820 --> 00:42:44,983
five beatings in total.

1298
00:42:45,389 --> 00:42:46,543
Let's make one person get all.

1299
00:42:46,690 --> 00:42:48,258
Isn't one each easy enough?

1300
00:42:48,259 --> 00:42:49,328
No way.

1301
00:42:49,329 --> 00:42:50,451
It's best not to get beat at all.

1302
00:42:51,730 --> 00:42:53,059
- Jong Kook. - Then one person gets all five?

1303
00:42:53,060 --> 00:42:54,698
- All five. - All?

1304
00:42:54,699 --> 00:42:56,026
- All five. - How about 3 and 2?

1305
00:42:56,099 --> 00:42:58,298
- There are five spoons here. - Fine, 3 and 2.

1306
00:42:58,299 --> 00:42:59,839
Whoever picks 3 and 2...

1307
00:42:59,840 --> 00:43:01,098
- Sounds good. - How's that?

1308
00:43:01,099 --> 00:43:02,599
- Okay. - Good.

1309
00:43:03,369 --> 00:43:04,408
That sounds good.

1310
00:43:04,409 --> 00:43:05,508
(That is how the game of spoons started.)

1311
00:43:05,509 --> 00:43:07,377
- I'm holding the end. - There.

1312
00:43:07,779 --> 00:43:09,548
- Okay! - Okay!

1313
00:43:09,549 --> 00:43:11,519
- Jong Kook, show us first. - Me?

1314
00:43:11,520 --> 00:43:13,448
- Yes. - It's 3. Or 2.

1315
00:43:13,449 --> 00:43:15,591
- Please. You get the beating. - 3 or 2.

1316
00:43:15,690 --> 00:43:17,689
- 3 or 2! - Please.

1317
00:43:17,750 --> 00:43:18,984
Please get the beating.

1318
00:43:19,259 --> 00:43:20,859
- Is it going to be strong beatings? - Please.

1319
00:43:20,860 --> 00:43:23,289
- 3 or 2. - 1, 2, 3!

1320
00:43:23,290 --> 00:43:24,350
3 or 2.

1321
00:43:25,029 --> 00:43:26,229
What is it?

1322
00:43:26,230 --> 00:43:27,688
(It's an empty spoon, meaning he is excused.)

1323
00:43:28,060 --> 00:43:30,298
(Why does he get away with it all the time?)

1324
00:43:30,299 --> 00:43:31,492
Okay!

1325
00:43:32,040 --> 00:43:35,039
- This is too... - Why is this happening?

1326
00:43:35,040 --> 00:43:36,539
It's unbelievable!

1327
00:43:36,540 --> 00:43:38,138
- I just picked one. - I can't believe it.

1328
00:43:38,139 --> 00:43:39,479
Why does he get excused?

1329
00:43:39,480 --> 00:43:40,939
- I didn't... - So Min, it's your turn.

1330
00:43:40,940 --> 00:43:42,348
- So Min. - Froggie.

1331
00:43:42,349 --> 00:43:43,548
- Froggie. - Froggie.

1332
00:43:43,549 --> 00:43:44,600
(She already looks anxious.)

1333
00:43:45,049 --> 00:43:46,379
(It can't be 3...)

1334
00:43:46,380 --> 00:43:47,578
- 3 or 2. - 3!

1335
00:43:47,579 --> 00:43:49,283
- I want to go home. - 1, 2, 3!

1336
00:43:49,489 --> 00:43:50,589
- Don't touch it. - What is it?

1337
00:43:50,590 --> 00:43:52,324
(So Min gets 3 beatings.)

1338
00:43:53,360 --> 00:43:54,388
You shouldn't have seen it in advance.

1339
00:43:54,389 --> 00:43:56,470
(So Min got 3!)

1340
00:43:57,230 --> 00:43:59,698
Why does this happen to me?

1341
00:43:59,699 --> 00:44:01,459
- She got 3. - The 3 is out.

1342
00:44:01,460 --> 00:44:03,428
- Okay. - The 3 is out.

1343
00:44:03,429 --> 00:44:04,828
- I don't want to get hit. - 2.

1344
00:44:04,829 --> 00:44:06,138
- 2! - 2!

1345
00:44:06,139 --> 00:44:08,968
(Will Jae Seok be able to avoid 2?)

1346
00:44:08,969 --> 00:44:10,638
- Please! Please! - 2! 2!

1347
00:44:10,639 --> 00:44:11,731
- 2! - 2!

1348
00:44:13,940 --> 00:44:16,458
(Oh, no.)

1349
00:44:17,110 --> 00:44:19,832
(Jae Seok gets 2 beatings with the stick.)

1350
00:44:19,980 --> 00:44:22,642
(No one can beat his legendary unluckiness.)

1351
00:44:22,650 --> 00:44:23,848
How do you always get it?

1352
00:44:23,849 --> 00:44:25,390
- I can't believe this. - It's him!

1353
00:44:25,590 --> 00:44:26,589
Seok Jin!

1354
00:44:26,590 --> 00:44:29,007
(Wherever they go, whatever they do, the members are always similar.)

1355
00:44:29,130 --> 00:44:31,559
It's still your lucky day, though.

1356
00:44:31,560 --> 00:44:33,129
You took two beatings.

1357
00:44:33,130 --> 00:44:34,282
(It's your lucky day, since you got 2.)

1358
00:44:34,400 --> 00:44:36,629
You're lucky today!

1359
00:44:36,630 --> 00:44:39,352
- You should buy a lottery ticket. - I felt good for a moment there.

1360
00:44:40,139 --> 00:44:41,709
- Think positively! - Yes.

1361
00:44:41,710 --> 00:44:43,138
- What he said actually... - You're lucky.

1362
00:44:43,139 --> 00:44:45,479
- has a point there. - Exactly.

1363
00:44:45,480 --> 00:44:48,979
If I got 2 between 3 and 2, I should be happy about it.

1364
00:44:48,980 --> 00:44:51,109
- You should buy a lottery ticket. - It's my lucky day today.

1365
00:44:51,110 --> 00:44:52,178
It's your lucky day.

1366
00:44:52,179 --> 00:44:53,506
Amazing.

1367
00:44:53,820 --> 00:44:56,707
We need to pick well who's going to hit us, So Min.

1368
00:44:57,020 --> 00:45:00,689
So Min, who gets three beatings, will go first.

1369
00:45:00,690 --> 00:45:01,883
So Min.

1370
00:45:02,630 --> 00:45:04,424
What if So Min gets her own name?

1371
00:45:04,529 --> 00:45:06,999
- That can't happen. - She gets to choose for herself.

1372
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:08,733
- I get to choose? That's nice. - She gets to choose.

1373
00:45:09,070 --> 00:45:10,368
1, 2, 3!

1374
00:45:10,369 --> 00:45:12,441
(So Min spins the wheel.)

1375
00:45:14,139 --> 00:45:17,638
Please. Please let it be Jae Seok.

1376
00:45:17,639 --> 00:45:19,278
Please. Please.

1377
00:45:19,279 --> 00:45:20,979
- It's Jong Kook. - It's Jong Kook.

1378
00:45:20,980 --> 00:45:22,749
(What? Jong Kook?)

1379
00:45:22,750 --> 00:45:24,442
(Gosh, it's Jong Kook...)

1380
00:45:25,679 --> 00:45:27,379
(Jong Kook, the famous physical therapist, gets chosen.)

1381
00:45:27,380 --> 00:45:28,614
You're totally out of luck today.

1382
00:45:28,690 --> 00:45:29,913
It's the worst day.

1383
00:45:30,049 --> 00:45:31,919
- It's your worst day. - I guess it's a bad day for you.

1384
00:45:31,920 --> 00:45:33,755
- It's your worst day. - It is.

1385
00:45:33,890 --> 00:45:35,889
I still have to go.

1386
00:45:35,890 --> 00:45:36,988
- Here. - Let's go.

1387
00:45:36,989 --> 00:45:38,988
- What if he gets Jong Kook too? - No way.

1388
00:45:38,989 --> 00:45:40,758
Jong Kook!

1389
00:45:40,759 --> 00:45:41,789
(They hope Jae Seok gets Jong Kook.)

1390
00:45:41,790 --> 00:45:43,028
- Jong Kook! - It has to be Jong Kook!.

1391
00:45:43,029 --> 00:45:44,798
- Stop! Stop! - Jong Kook!

1392
00:45:44,799 --> 00:45:46,429
(Will Jong Kook get to hit Jae Seok as everyone is wishing?)

1393
00:45:46,430 --> 00:45:47,929
It has to be Jong Kook.

1394
00:45:47,930 --> 00:45:50,245
(Will Jong Kook get to hit Jae Seok, as everyone is wishing?)

1395
00:45:50,281 --> 00:45:51,188
I still have to go.

1396
00:45:51,189 --> 00:45:52,288
- Here. - Let's go.

1397
00:45:52,289 --> 00:45:54,299
- What if he gets Jong Kook too? - No way.

1398
00:45:54,300 --> 00:45:56,058
Jong Kook!

1399
00:45:56,059 --> 00:45:57,098
(They hope Jae Seok gets Jong Kook.)

1400
00:45:57,099 --> 00:45:58,328
- Jong Kook! - It has to be Jong Kook!

1401
00:45:58,329 --> 00:46:00,134
- Stop! Stop! - Jong Kook!

1402
00:46:01,240 --> 00:46:03,438
(Who will get to hit Jae Seok?)

1403
00:46:03,439 --> 00:46:04,969
It has to be Jong Kook.

1404
00:46:05,169 --> 00:46:06,339
- Is it Jong Kook? - Is it Jong Kook?

1405
00:46:06,340 --> 00:46:08,308
- It's So Min! - It's So Min!

1406
00:46:08,309 --> 00:46:09,329
It's So Min.

1407
00:46:09,840 --> 00:46:11,209
Why me?

1408
00:46:11,210 --> 00:46:12,779
- It's So Min. - Why me?

1409
00:46:12,780 --> 00:46:13,879
- It's So Min. - I can't go hard on her.

1410
00:46:13,880 --> 00:46:16,369
I'm upset because Jae Seok is so happy about it.

1411
00:46:16,579 --> 00:46:17,919
2 hits from So Min.

1412
00:46:17,920 --> 00:46:19,089
That's the best scenario possible.

1413
00:46:19,090 --> 00:46:20,219
- That's the best case. - Yes.

1414
00:46:20,220 --> 00:46:22,089
I'm fine as long as it's not Jong Kook.

1415
00:46:22,090 --> 00:46:23,518
- Right. - Ji Hyo would've been fine.

1416
00:46:23,519 --> 00:46:25,529
I don't want to hit So Min too hard.

1417
00:46:25,530 --> 00:46:27,295
- You have to. - Come on.

1418
00:46:27,690 --> 00:46:30,189
She's like a sister to me.

1419
00:46:30,190 --> 00:46:31,319
- You know what you said. - Hey!

1420
00:46:31,320 --> 00:46:33,769
- Hit hard as much as you care. - Hit hard as much as you care.

1421
00:46:34,360 --> 00:46:35,959
What is wrong with me today?

1422
00:46:35,960 --> 00:46:37,226
Where...

1423
00:46:37,500 --> 00:46:39,265
did it go wrong?

1424
00:46:40,029 --> 00:46:41,258
Jong Kook!

1425
00:46:41,259 --> 00:46:42,427
(Show us what you got.)

1426
00:46:42,428 --> 00:46:43,597
Do it properly.

1427
00:46:43,598 --> 00:46:44,867
- It's too narrow. - I don't like this.

1428
00:46:44,868 --> 00:46:46,664
- It's going to hurt. - I can't swing properly.

1429
00:46:46,868 --> 00:46:48,980
Why don't you move it further?

1430
00:46:49,098 --> 00:46:50,438
- Further? - Wait.

1431
00:46:50,439 --> 00:46:51,608
Jae Seok.

1432
00:46:51,609 --> 00:46:53,342
Aren't you getting a bit too involved?

1433
00:46:54,408 --> 00:46:56,438
(He created some space with his foot.)

1434
00:46:56,439 --> 00:46:58,378
- That's good. - Okay.

1435
00:46:58,379 --> 00:46:59,577
Very good.

1436
00:46:59,578 --> 00:47:00,847
- It looks good. - I'm scared.

1437
00:47:00,848 --> 00:47:02,677
- I'm scared. - Prepare yourself!

1438
00:47:02,678 --> 00:47:03,818
- You can't do that! - Prepare yourself.

1439
00:47:03,819 --> 00:47:04,918
I'm so scared.

1440
00:47:04,919 --> 00:47:06,188
(And that was...)

1441
00:47:06,189 --> 00:47:07,188
(the end of...)

1442
00:47:07,189 --> 00:47:09,707
(a neat physical therapy.)

1443
00:47:09,788 --> 00:47:10,988
- That was good. - Yes!

1444
00:47:10,989 --> 00:47:11,988
- Now, - Oh, no.

1445
00:47:11,989 --> 00:47:14,242
So Min, keep that anger inside you.

1446
00:47:14,759 --> 00:47:16,728
- Okay. - Okay.

1447
00:47:16,729 --> 00:47:18,028
- Okay. - Okay.

1448
00:47:18,029 --> 00:47:19,767
- Okay. - So Min,

1449
00:47:19,768 --> 00:47:20,997
don't break your paddle.

1450
00:47:20,998 --> 00:47:22,267
I'm going to squeeze my buttocks.

1451
00:47:22,268 --> 00:47:24,338
- Hold that anger. - Okay.

1452
00:47:24,339 --> 00:47:25,838
You have to hit harder because you're a woman.

1453
00:47:25,839 --> 00:47:27,308
- Okay! - So Min...

1454
00:47:27,578 --> 00:47:28,878
(Okay!)

1455
00:47:28,879 --> 00:47:30,307
Okay.

1456
00:47:30,408 --> 00:47:31,778
- Okay. - So Min.

1457
00:47:31,779 --> 00:47:33,074
Go easy on me.

1458
00:47:33,448 --> 00:47:34,847
So Min, try hitting...

1459
00:47:34,848 --> 00:47:36,577
- at the center. - That's the spot.

1460
00:47:36,578 --> 00:47:37,747
Hold it like this.

1461
00:47:37,748 --> 00:47:39,421
- Like this. - Hey, Jong Kook.

1462
00:47:39,689 --> 00:47:41,454
Why are you teaching her?

1463
00:47:41,558 --> 00:47:43,688
Why are you teaching her?

1464
00:47:43,689 --> 00:47:45,157
It hurts less if you hold it closer.

1465
00:47:45,158 --> 00:47:46,358
- You must hold it longer. - Hold it longer.

1466
00:47:46,359 --> 00:47:47,828
- It hurts more like this. - Hey!

1467
00:47:48,158 --> 00:47:49,458
- Stop giving her a lesson. - Hold it like this.

1468
00:47:49,459 --> 00:47:51,467
- Stand here and guide me. - Like this.

1469
00:47:51,468 --> 00:47:52,528
- Hold it like this. - Why are you teaching her?

1470
00:47:52,529 --> 00:47:53,938
- Like this. - Yes, teach me.

1471
00:47:53,939 --> 00:47:55,631
- I'm doing it! - Like this.

1472
00:47:55,868 --> 00:47:57,097
(What is she doing?)

1473
00:47:57,098 --> 00:47:58,807
I'm doing it.

1474
00:47:58,808 --> 00:47:59,867
Okay?

1475
00:47:59,868 --> 00:48:01,077
- I'm doing it. - Hold it like this,

1476
00:48:01,078 --> 00:48:02,577
- and go straight down. - Okay.

1477
00:48:02,578 --> 00:48:04,907
- Go up and come straight down. - 1, 2, 3.

1478
00:48:04,908 --> 00:48:05,947
(Spanks)

1479
00:48:05,948 --> 00:48:07,878
- You did well. - You did well.

1480
00:48:07,879 --> 00:48:09,648
(I mean, how hard could she...)

1481
00:48:09,649 --> 00:48:11,447
(He cries out in pain.)

1482
00:48:11,448 --> 00:48:13,253
- You did well. - You're good at this.

1483
00:48:13,319 --> 00:48:15,258
- So Min is good at it. - She's good.

1484
00:48:15,259 --> 00:48:16,387
She went straight down.

1485
00:48:16,388 --> 00:48:17,657
That felt great.

1486
00:48:17,658 --> 00:48:19,088
Go up and come down.

1487
00:48:19,089 --> 00:48:20,730
His lesson worked after all.

1488
00:48:21,058 --> 00:48:22,497
Why are you giving her a lesson?

1489
00:48:22,498 --> 00:48:23,728
- He's angry. - I have to.

1490
00:48:23,729 --> 00:48:24,927
Are you guys dating or something?

1491
00:48:24,928 --> 00:48:26,356
- No. - Then why?

1492
00:48:26,468 --> 00:48:28,568
- Why are you teaching her? - You need to be spanked funny.

1493
00:48:28,569 --> 00:48:29,619
Come on.

1494
00:48:29,739 --> 00:48:32,666
This isn't a billiard room, take off your gloves!

1495
00:48:32,709 --> 00:48:34,407
I mean, come on!

1496
00:48:34,408 --> 00:48:35,637
- Hey. - Come on.

1497
00:48:35,638 --> 00:48:37,677
- His lesson works. - Why is he doing that?

1498
00:48:37,678 --> 00:48:39,177
- Hold it tight. Go for the center. - Yes.

1499
00:48:39,178 --> 00:48:40,648
Go easy on me, So Min.

1500
00:48:40,649 --> 00:48:42,048
- Like this? - No, hold it closer.

1501
00:48:42,049 --> 00:48:43,148
Hold right here.

1502
00:48:43,149 --> 00:48:44,247
Hey!

1503
00:48:44,248 --> 00:48:46,288
I'm going to poop if you hit me too hard.

1504
00:48:46,788 --> 00:48:48,458
- Hold it like this. - You be careful, okay?

1505
00:48:48,459 --> 00:48:49,743
- One, - I'm serious.

1506
00:48:51,629 --> 00:48:52,887
- One, - I'm serious.

1507
00:48:52,888 --> 00:48:55,959
(He tosses the paddle to So Min right after.)

1508
00:48:56,498 --> 00:48:57,620
(They're showing perfect teamwork.)

1509
00:48:57,899 --> 00:48:59,295
- You did great. - You did great.

1510
00:48:59,569 --> 00:49:00,767
(This is why I spank.)

1511
00:49:00,768 --> 00:49:02,063
So Min, you're good at this.

1512
00:49:02,198 --> 00:49:03,596
So Min!

1513
00:49:03,799 --> 00:49:05,604
That was awesome. You did great.

1514
00:49:06,009 --> 00:49:07,508
- See why you should hold it longer? - I understand now.

1515
00:49:07,509 --> 00:49:09,778
- You have to hold it longer. - Right.

1516
00:49:09,779 --> 00:49:11,048
And you hit the center very accurately.

1517
00:49:11,049 --> 00:49:12,374
- I get it. - That hurt so much.

1518
00:49:13,078 --> 00:49:14,548
- Jae Seok! - That hurt so much.

1519
00:49:14,549 --> 00:49:15,976
(Today is Jae Seok's lucky day.)

1520
00:49:16,779 --> 00:49:17,988
(Meanwhile, at the spicy buckwheat noodles restaurant)

1521
00:49:17,989 --> 00:49:19,314
- This is so good. - It's tasty.

1522
00:49:19,518 --> 00:49:20,918
Don't forget...

1523
00:49:20,919 --> 00:49:22,258
(Only one of them can acquire the Chance Card.)

1524
00:49:22,259 --> 00:49:24,879
the fact that only one of you...

1525
00:49:25,089 --> 00:49:27,398
will be acquiring the Chance Card.

1526
00:49:27,399 --> 00:49:28,427
- Sure. - We know.

1527
00:49:28,428 --> 00:49:30,601
(They'll choose who gets it with the rock-paper-scissors.)

1528
00:49:31,698 --> 00:49:33,401
- Rock, paper, scissors! - Rock, paper, scissors!

1529
00:49:33,598 --> 00:49:35,338
(Haha wins on the first game.)

1530
00:49:35,339 --> 00:49:36,389
Okay!

1531
00:49:37,569 --> 00:49:38,762
So that was it for my luck.

1532
00:49:39,739 --> 00:49:41,508
(He realized his reality.)

1533
00:49:41,509 --> 00:49:43,344
This is why...

1534
00:49:43,939 --> 00:49:45,708
you need to know your place.

1535
00:49:45,709 --> 00:49:48,247
And you should know when to stop.

1536
00:49:48,248 --> 00:49:50,617
When people keep telling you you're good,

1537
00:49:50,618 --> 00:49:52,347
you're going to deceive yourself.

1538
00:49:52,348 --> 00:49:53,347
Right, you should know your place.

1539
00:49:53,348 --> 00:49:55,297
I was about to go to a rock-paper-scissors contest.

1540
00:49:56,489 --> 00:49:57,688
That was it for my luck.

1541
00:49:57,689 --> 00:49:59,157
- Okay. - Thank you!

1542
00:49:59,158 --> 00:50:00,958
Here's your Chance Card.

1543
00:50:00,959 --> 00:50:03,157
Look inside, but don't let them see it.

1544
00:50:03,158 --> 00:50:05,780
(This Chance Card will be useful in the final mission later.)

1545
00:50:06,899 --> 00:50:08,571
This looks amazing.

1546
00:50:08,638 --> 00:50:10,267
Now you've got your Chance Card,

1547
00:50:10,268 --> 00:50:12,308
let's move on to the final mission spot.

1548
00:50:12,638 --> 00:50:13,938
Let's go!

1549
00:50:13,939 --> 00:50:15,101
- Kwang Soo. - I'm nervous.

1550
00:50:15,638 --> 00:50:18,648
(They've all gathered at the final mission spot to win the prize.)

1551
00:50:18,649 --> 00:50:20,208
- What is all this? - What is that?

1552
00:50:20,209 --> 00:50:21,517
(What is that?)

1553
00:50:21,518 --> 00:50:22,617
What is all this?

1554
00:50:22,618 --> 00:50:23,778
Look at the size.

1555
00:50:23,779 --> 00:50:24,947
What is this?

1556
00:50:24,948 --> 00:50:26,315
What are we doing today?

1557
00:50:26,888 --> 00:50:27,918
What is this?

1558
00:50:27,919 --> 00:50:29,287
(What stands before them is...)

1559
00:50:29,288 --> 00:50:30,920
- What is this? - What's going on?

1560
00:50:31,759 --> 00:50:32,827
This looks scary.

1561
00:50:32,828 --> 00:50:34,868
It looks scary because I don't know what it does.

1562
00:50:35,259 --> 00:50:37,228
Look at the size. What is this?

1563
00:50:37,229 --> 00:50:38,597
(Each of the eight platforms is facing a cube.)

1564
00:50:38,598 --> 00:50:39,697
Look at that.

1565
00:50:39,698 --> 00:50:41,126
This is unbelievable.

1566
00:50:41,239 --> 00:50:43,411
What are we supposed to do here?

1567
00:50:43,698 --> 00:50:45,984
Stand on the platform with the number you like.

1568
00:50:46,009 --> 00:50:47,090
I'm scared.

1569
00:50:47,379 --> 00:50:48,837
There are cubes behind.

1570
00:50:48,839 --> 00:50:50,410
Are we bouncing off of it?

1571
00:50:50,509 --> 00:50:52,080
Do you see the cubes at the front?

1572
00:50:52,479 --> 00:50:53,648
What are those?

1573
00:50:53,649 --> 00:50:54,847
They're going to fly towards you.

1574
00:50:54,848 --> 00:50:55,940
Seriously?

1575
00:50:56,379 --> 00:50:58,735
(They cannot believe what they just heard.)

1576
00:50:58,788 --> 00:51:00,318
Are you trying to kill us?

1577
00:51:00,319 --> 00:51:01,318
(The safety is thoroughly checked.)

1578
00:51:01,319 --> 00:51:03,298
Wouldn't it hurt too much?

1579
00:51:03,359 --> 00:51:04,716
It's going to hurt.

1580
00:51:04,828 --> 00:51:06,288
It's going to hurt.

1581
00:51:06,359 --> 00:51:08,501
What's it going to be? I'm curious though.

1582
00:51:08,859 --> 00:51:10,184
(They're scared.)

1583
00:51:10,868 --> 00:51:12,697
(The cubes sway.)

1584
00:51:12,698 --> 00:51:14,401
(Swaying)

1585
00:51:15,138 --> 00:51:16,598
What is going on?

1586
00:51:17,038 --> 00:51:19,048
- It moved. - Those are...

1587
00:51:19,109 --> 00:51:20,291
really big.

1588
00:51:20,609 --> 00:51:22,169
It's going to be fine.

1589
00:51:22,638 --> 00:51:23,938
We're not going to die.

1590
00:51:23,939 --> 00:51:26,878
Some of you have gotten the Chance Card,

1591
00:51:26,879 --> 00:51:27,878
and some of you have not.

1592
00:51:27,879 --> 00:51:28,918
- Yes. - Yes.

1593
00:51:28,919 --> 00:51:29,947
Ji Hyo, Jong Kook,

1594
00:51:29,948 --> 00:51:31,581
So Min, and Haha has one.

1595
00:51:32,748 --> 00:51:35,034
I don't remember getting something like Chance Card?

1596
00:51:35,158 --> 00:51:37,157
We'll begin with our final round.

1597
00:51:37,558 --> 00:51:38,958
In this round,

1598
00:51:38,959 --> 00:51:41,815
you will solve riddles about Sejong the Great.

1599
00:51:42,899 --> 00:51:45,068
- I'm finished. - The one who survives...

1600
00:51:45,069 --> 00:51:47,241
to the last will be the champion.

1601
00:51:47,569 --> 00:51:48,798
- We're solving riddles. - Okay.

1602
00:51:48,799 --> 00:51:49,967
I should have studied.

1603
00:51:49,968 --> 00:51:51,438
In every round,

1604
00:51:51,439 --> 00:51:53,855
one of the members who didn't get the right answer...

1605
00:51:54,038 --> 00:51:55,843
will be eliminated.

1606
00:51:57,649 --> 00:51:59,478
And the member to be eliminated...

1607
00:51:59,479 --> 00:52:01,447
will be chosen by the one who got the right answer.

1608
00:52:01,448 --> 00:52:03,017
(They will be eliminated by the member who got it right.)

1609
00:52:03,018 --> 00:52:04,247
We're pointing one out?

1610
00:52:04,248 --> 00:52:05,387
I think we are.

1611
00:52:05,388 --> 00:52:07,247
The winner of each round will write...

1612
00:52:07,248 --> 00:52:09,738
one of the platform numbers where the other members are standing...

1613
00:52:09,919 --> 00:52:11,657
on the blackboard.

1614
00:52:11,658 --> 00:52:13,427
The cube will fly towards...

1615
00:52:13,428 --> 00:52:15,948
the appointed platform to eliminate the member on it.

1616
00:52:16,558 --> 00:52:18,197
Will the questions be difficult?

1617
00:52:18,198 --> 00:52:19,228
(So the cube will fly towards the appointed platform?)

1618
00:52:19,229 --> 00:52:20,327
That's harsh.

1619
00:52:20,328 --> 00:52:21,521
I'm scared.

1620
00:52:21,939 --> 00:52:23,537
But, the rest of the members...

1621
00:52:23,538 --> 00:52:26,108
may stay on their platforms...

1622
00:52:26,109 --> 00:52:28,307
or change their spots behind the winner.

1623
00:52:28,308 --> 00:52:29,608
(They can switch or stay on their platforms.)

1624
00:52:29,609 --> 00:52:33,407
(That means the winner cannot know who is standing on which platform.)

1625
00:52:33,408 --> 00:52:34,677
So the winner doesn't know...

1626
00:52:34,678 --> 00:52:35,973
who will be eliminated.

1627
00:52:36,118 --> 00:52:37,717
I might survive!

1628
00:52:37,718 --> 00:52:38,918
(If I'm lucky.)

1629
00:52:38,919 --> 00:52:41,258
Se Chan, you're supposed to try and guess the right answer.

1630
00:52:41,259 --> 00:52:42,789
(You're supposed to guess the right answer.)

1631
00:52:43,459 --> 00:52:44,657
You should be trying to guess the right answer.

1632
00:52:44,658 --> 00:52:46,028
I'm only trying to survive.

1633
00:52:46,029 --> 00:52:47,354
I know I'm not guessing the right answer.

1634
00:52:47,729 --> 00:52:48,898
You're only...

1635
00:52:48,899 --> 00:52:50,490
- trying to survive? - I got it.

1636
00:52:50,799 --> 00:52:52,839
Seok Jin, Jong Kook, and Jae Seok...

1637
00:52:52,968 --> 00:52:56,097
have some knowledge of history.

1638
00:52:56,098 --> 00:52:57,967
Jae Seok knows a lot,

1639
00:52:57,968 --> 00:52:59,601
- so we should get rid of him first. - But we don't know how...

1640
00:52:59,669 --> 00:53:01,037
- Come on! - He's right.

1641
00:53:01,038 --> 00:53:02,238
We have to get rid of him first.

1642
00:53:02,239 --> 00:53:03,778
We should eliminate the ones with Chance Cards.

1643
00:53:03,779 --> 00:53:04,778
The ones with Chance Cards.

1644
00:53:04,779 --> 00:53:06,379
I think that's a good idea!

1645
00:53:06,509 --> 00:53:08,278
We don't know anything even if we have the cards.

1646
00:53:08,279 --> 00:53:09,717
I still don't know anything.

1647
00:53:09,718 --> 00:53:10,717
(They're not so confident in solving riddles.)

1648
00:53:10,718 --> 00:53:11,717
This is crazy.

1649
00:53:11,718 --> 00:53:13,688
The riddles will not only be about history.

1650
00:53:13,689 --> 00:53:15,352
- There are other areas too. - Sure.

1651
00:53:15,518 --> 00:53:16,787
All of the riddles...

1652
00:53:16,788 --> 00:53:19,028
will be related to Sejong the Great.

1653
00:53:19,029 --> 00:53:20,088
Okay.

1654
00:53:20,089 --> 00:53:21,157
Are you ready?

1655
00:53:21,158 --> 00:53:22,628
- Let's go! - Let's go!

1656
00:53:22,629 --> 00:53:23,657
(Who will survive at last?)

1657
00:53:23,658 --> 00:53:24,953
I'll try my best.

1658
00:53:24,998 --> 00:53:27,028
Let's go. Let's go get it.

1659
00:53:27,029 --> 00:53:28,068
I'm nervous.

1660
00:53:28,069 --> 00:53:29,338
Here goes the first riddle.

1661
00:53:29,339 --> 00:53:30,562
I should have studied.

1662
00:53:30,669 --> 00:53:34,307
Which of these places do not have the statue...

1663
00:53:34,308 --> 00:53:35,608
of Sejong the Great?

1664
00:53:35,609 --> 00:53:36,978
- I already don't know. - Okay.

1665
00:53:36,979 --> 00:53:37,978
- I'm done. - That sounds difficult.

1666
00:53:37,979 --> 00:53:40,395
Number one, Apgujeong Elementary School.

1667
00:53:40,578 --> 00:53:43,986
Number two, National Hangeul Museum.

1668
00:53:44,718 --> 00:53:47,136
Number three, Yeouido Park.

1669
00:53:47,288 --> 00:53:49,787
Number four, King Sejong the Great Memorial Hall.

1670
00:53:49,788 --> 00:53:50,858
Let me answer!

1671
00:53:50,859 --> 00:53:52,358
(Jae Seok's attempt)

1672
00:53:52,359 --> 00:53:53,756
Number one, Apgujeong Elementary School.

1673
00:53:54,328 --> 00:53:56,497
I visit the school pretty often.

1674
00:53:56,498 --> 00:53:57,827
- Really? - Then he should be right.

1675
00:53:57,828 --> 00:54:00,668
Yes, and they have the statue of Admiral Yi Sun Shin.

1676
00:54:00,669 --> 00:54:02,535
(It must be the statue of Admiral Yi Sun Shin.)

1677
00:54:02,698 --> 00:54:03,838
It's wrong?

1678
00:54:03,839 --> 00:54:04,907
- Let me answer! - Let me answer!

1679
00:54:04,908 --> 00:54:06,068
(Seok Jin's attempt)

1680
00:54:06,069 --> 00:54:09,240
Number four, King Sejong the Great Memorial Hall.

1681
00:54:10,239 --> 00:54:11,636
- Let me answer! - Let me answer!

1682
00:54:11,709 --> 00:54:12,778
Let me answer.

1683
00:54:12,779 --> 00:54:14,277
Three, Yeouido Park.

1684
00:54:14,479 --> 00:54:15,570
- Let me answer! - Let me answer!

1685
00:54:15,718 --> 00:54:16,878
- Let me answer! - Let me answer!

1686
00:54:16,879 --> 00:54:18,785
(There's only number 2 left.)

1687
00:54:19,419 --> 00:54:20,572
There's only one left.

1688
00:54:20,649 --> 00:54:21,818
You don't know what it is.

1689
00:54:21,819 --> 00:54:22,858
(You don't know what it is.)

1690
00:54:22,859 --> 00:54:25,479
You need to say the number and the name of the place.

1691
00:54:25,629 --> 00:54:26,858
He can't remember it.

1692
00:54:26,859 --> 00:54:27,981
Wait.

1693
00:54:28,098 --> 00:54:29,660
I can't remember it either.

1694
00:54:29,729 --> 00:54:31,327
- Hold on. - Five!

1695
00:54:31,328 --> 00:54:32,767
- Four! - Wait up!

1696
00:54:32,768 --> 00:54:33,922
- I can't remember it either. - Let me answer.

1697
00:54:34,229 --> 00:54:35,493
Number two,

1698
00:54:35,638 --> 00:54:37,537
Hangeul Memorial Hall.

1699
00:54:37,538 --> 00:54:38,997
- Let me answer! - Let me answer!

1700
00:54:39,069 --> 00:54:40,208
- Let me answer! - Let me answer!

1701
00:54:40,209 --> 00:54:41,577
- Let me answer! - Kwang Soo, go ahead.

1702
00:54:41,578 --> 00:54:45,077
Korea Hangeul National Museum.

1703
00:54:45,078 --> 00:54:46,278
(Wrong answer)

1704
00:54:46,279 --> 00:54:47,478
Let me answer!

1705
00:54:47,479 --> 00:54:48,600
(Haha's attempt)

1706
00:54:49,049 --> 00:54:51,717
King Sejong the Great Korean National Museum.

1707
00:54:51,718 --> 00:54:53,918
(Another wrong answer)

1708
00:54:53,919 --> 00:54:56,887
Let me answer! National Hangeul Museum.

1709
00:54:56,888 --> 00:55:00,296
(That is precisely right.)

1710
00:55:00,828 --> 00:55:01,982
Okay!

1711
00:55:02,328 --> 00:55:03,827
(The rest of them has the statue of King Sejong the Great.)

1712
00:55:03,828 --> 00:55:04,920
That's what I said!

1713
00:55:04,928 --> 00:55:07,168
We are incredible. All of us avoided the right answer.

1714
00:55:07,169 --> 00:55:08,798
- Okay. - For goodness' sake.

1715
00:55:08,799 --> 00:55:11,568
Jae Seok, you are the winner. Please come forward.

1716
00:55:11,569 --> 00:55:12,767
Okay.

1717
00:55:12,768 --> 00:55:14,267
Jae Seok, I think...

1718
00:55:14,268 --> 00:55:16,378
you should eliminate those with Chance Cards.

1719
00:55:16,379 --> 00:55:17,775
- That's right. - Okay.

1720
00:55:17,779 --> 00:55:21,347
Please either change or maintain your place...

1721
00:55:21,348 --> 00:55:22,502
in the back.

1722
00:55:22,919 --> 00:55:24,387
(Jae Seok has his eyes covered.)

1723
00:55:24,388 --> 00:55:25,787
So Min is on Platform Five.

1724
00:55:25,788 --> 00:55:27,379
Kwang Soo is on Platform Five.

1725
00:55:27,888 --> 00:55:28,940
Please.

1726
00:55:28,989 --> 00:55:31,528
(Neither the ones on the platforms...)

1727
00:55:31,529 --> 00:55:32,728
(nor the winner who chooses the number...)

1728
00:55:32,729 --> 00:55:34,187
All of us should change places.

1729
00:55:34,288 --> 00:55:35,597
(knows who will get eliminated until the cube comes flying.)

1730
00:55:35,598 --> 00:55:39,528
- All of us should change places. - 3, 2, 1.

1731
00:55:39,529 --> 00:55:42,905
Now, you can neither move nor make a sound.

1732
00:55:42,998 --> 00:55:44,068
Jae Seok, take off your blindfold.

1733
00:55:44,069 --> 00:55:45,874
- I will look at the front. - Look at the front.

1734
00:55:46,439 --> 00:55:47,835
I don't know which number I should pick.

1735
00:55:48,279 --> 00:55:49,604
The numbers are from 1 to 8, right?

1736
00:55:49,879 --> 00:55:52,632
If you pick an empty platform,

1737
00:55:52,649 --> 00:55:54,778
- everyone will survive this round. - Really?

1738
00:55:54,779 --> 00:55:57,329
(If he picks an empty platform, everyone will survive this round.)

1739
00:55:58,248 --> 00:55:59,488
You wouldn't want that.

1740
00:55:59,489 --> 00:56:01,458
(Please don't let it be my number.)

1741
00:56:02,218 --> 00:56:05,088
(Jae Seok has only one goal.)

1742
00:56:05,089 --> 00:56:08,117
(It's the elimination of those with Chance Cards.)

1743
00:56:08,629 --> 00:56:13,770
(Will he be able to eliminate someone with the Chance Card?)

1744
00:56:14,439 --> 00:56:15,467
I wrote it down.

1745
00:56:15,468 --> 00:56:16,488
(He chose a number.)

1746
00:56:17,368 --> 00:56:19,108
(Among 7 members who didn't get the right answer,)

1747
00:56:19,109 --> 00:56:21,378
Here we go. He wrote a number down.

1748
00:56:21,379 --> 00:56:22,501
(who will be eliminated first?)

1749
00:56:23,479 --> 00:56:25,590
Who will it be? Shall I take off my glasses?

1750
00:56:26,248 --> 00:56:28,247
- Three, - Come on!

1751
00:56:28,248 --> 00:56:29,278
Two.

1752
00:56:29,279 --> 00:56:30,278
(Towards whom will the giant cube fly?)

1753
00:56:30,279 --> 00:56:31,308
One.

1754
00:56:31,819 --> 00:56:34,920
(Who will be the first person to get eliminated?)

1755
00:56:35,018 --> 00:56:36,038
One.

1756
00:56:36,419 --> 00:56:37,418
Shoot.

1757
00:56:37,419 --> 00:56:38,653
(The cube is launched.)

1758
00:56:38,729 --> 00:56:39,780
Shoot.

1759
00:56:41,158 --> 00:56:43,858
(The giant cube is powerful.)

1760
00:56:43,859 --> 00:56:44,888
Shoot.

1761
00:56:45,129 --> 00:56:48,943
(The first person to get eliminated is Kwang Soo.)

1762
00:56:52,768 --> 00:56:54,778
(Kwang Soo was standing on Platform Five.)

1763
00:56:54,779 --> 00:56:58,451
(Jae Seok wrote down 5 without knowing anything.)

1764
00:56:59,178 --> 00:57:01,177
- 5! - 5!

1765
00:57:01,178 --> 00:57:03,218
(Kwang Soo is eliminated.)

1766
00:57:03,678 --> 00:57:04,988
- 5! - 5!

1767
00:57:04,989 --> 00:57:06,273
Gosh, it's nerve-wracking.

1768
00:57:06,649 --> 00:57:09,036
How did you pick five?

1769
00:57:09,158 --> 00:57:10,858
Why were you there?

1770
00:57:10,859 --> 00:57:13,582
I am so annoyed. I was going to pick Platform Six.

1771
00:57:13,689 --> 00:57:14,958
I am so annoyed.

1772
00:57:14,959 --> 00:57:16,182
Seriously.

1773
00:57:17,058 --> 00:57:19,139
- Is this the end for me? - Kwang Soo.

1774
00:57:19,569 --> 00:57:20,798
- Is this the end for me? - It's the end.

1775
00:57:20,799 --> 00:57:21,997
Kwang Soo, take the stairs down.

1776
00:57:21,998 --> 00:57:23,835
I debated between 5 and 6.

1777
00:57:24,368 --> 00:57:26,552
- Kwang Soo, this is for the best. - Bye.

1778
00:57:26,908 --> 00:57:27,978
Your mind must be at ease now.

1779
00:57:27,979 --> 00:57:29,161
I am so annoyed.

1780
00:57:29,538 --> 00:57:31,177
(I could have gotten it right.)

1781
00:57:31,178 --> 00:57:32,247
I could have gotten it right.

1782
00:57:32,248 --> 00:57:35,478
Seok Jin has an advantage with this problem.

1783
00:57:35,479 --> 00:57:36,847
- Really? - What could it be?

1784
00:57:36,848 --> 00:57:39,296
Of course. He was alive in the time of Sejong the Great.

1785
00:57:40,419 --> 00:57:42,091
(I will get the next question right.)

1786
00:57:42,288 --> 00:57:43,588
Here comes the second question.

1787
00:57:43,589 --> 00:57:45,427
- Okay. - Please.

1788
00:57:45,428 --> 00:57:48,458
Which bill doesn't have...

1789
00:57:48,799 --> 00:57:50,327
Sejong the Great?

1790
00:57:50,328 --> 00:57:52,168
Which bill doesn't have Sejong the Great?

1791
00:57:52,169 --> 00:57:53,827
(Which bill doesn't have Sejong the Great?)

1792
00:57:53,828 --> 00:57:55,909
Number 1, 1,000 hwan.

1793
00:57:56,169 --> 00:57:58,585
- What's "Hwan"? - It must be the old currency.

1794
00:57:58,638 --> 00:58:00,546
Number 2, 50 jeon.

1795
00:58:01,009 --> 00:58:03,731
- I have no idea. - Number 3, 100 won.

1796
00:58:04,748 --> 00:58:06,478
Number 4, 10,000 won.

1797
00:58:06,479 --> 00:58:07,548
- I got it. - I got it.

1798
00:58:07,549 --> 00:58:08,617
Haha, go ahead.

1799
00:58:08,618 --> 00:58:10,778
- Number one. - What's the answer?

1800
00:58:10,779 --> 00:58:11,988
(Number 1!)

1801
00:58:11,989 --> 00:58:13,009
Hwan...

1802
00:58:13,649 --> 00:58:15,147
1,000 hwan.

1803
00:58:15,288 --> 00:58:17,400
- Number one, 1,000 hwan? - Yes. Number one, 1,000 hwan.

1804
00:58:18,529 --> 00:58:19,549
(Incorrect)

1805
00:58:19,989 --> 00:58:22,898
I got it. Number 3, 100 won.

1806
00:58:22,899 --> 00:58:24,767
(Number 3, 100 won!)

1807
00:58:24,768 --> 00:58:26,533
- 100 won? - Does it have Sejong the Great?

1808
00:58:27,428 --> 00:58:28,662
(Sejong the Great was in the bills that were used from 1965 to 1980.)

1809
00:58:28,799 --> 00:58:29,798
Does 100 won have Sejong the Great?

1810
00:58:29,799 --> 00:58:30,838
(100 won bill had Sejong the Great.)

1811
00:58:30,839 --> 00:58:33,867
I got it. Number 2, 50 jeon.

1812
00:58:33,868 --> 00:58:34,878
(Number 2, 50 jeon!)

1813
00:58:34,879 --> 00:58:35,899
- It's correct. - Yes!

1814
00:58:36,479 --> 00:58:37,878
I will survive for another round!

1815
00:58:37,879 --> 00:58:39,978
- My goodness. - This is driving me crazy.

1816
00:58:39,979 --> 00:58:42,117
- My goodness. - Number 2, 50 jeon.

1817
00:58:42,118 --> 00:58:43,978
- All other options have it. - How did it get it right?

1818
00:58:43,979 --> 00:58:45,723
I took a wild guess.

1819
00:58:45,848 --> 00:58:47,747
How would I know?

1820
00:58:47,748 --> 00:58:50,309
- I am jealous of Se Chan. - Okay.

1821
00:58:50,359 --> 00:58:51,827
What should I do?

1822
00:58:51,828 --> 00:58:53,628
I need to use the Chance Card.

1823
00:58:53,629 --> 00:58:55,535
What should I do if I don't get to use it?

1824
00:58:55,799 --> 00:58:57,697
It will be really annoying if you don't get to use it.

1825
00:58:57,698 --> 00:59:00,891
I hope I eliminate someone with the Chance Card.

1826
00:59:01,468 --> 00:59:03,597
There is no eight.

1827
00:59:03,598 --> 00:59:05,867
- Pick a number from 1 to 7. - Okay.

1828
00:59:05,868 --> 00:59:07,470
(7 members remain.)

1829
00:59:07,879 --> 00:59:09,108
I would rather get eliminated.

1830
00:59:09,109 --> 00:59:10,378
1 to 7.

1831
00:59:10,379 --> 00:59:11,775
My mind is at ease.

1832
00:59:12,848 --> 00:59:13,847
(You must overcome this tension...)

1833
00:59:13,848 --> 00:59:16,077
3. 2.

1834
00:59:16,078 --> 00:59:17,077
(in order to win.)

1835
00:59:17,078 --> 00:59:20,488
One. You can't move now.

1836
00:59:20,489 --> 00:59:21,539
Don't make a sound.

1837
00:59:22,689 --> 00:59:26,258
(Everyone waits with bated breath.)

1838
00:59:26,259 --> 00:59:28,850
(Se Chan chooses a number.)

1839
00:59:30,359 --> 00:59:33,868
(Which number did Se Chan choose?)

1840
00:59:33,928 --> 00:59:35,162
Which number is it?

1841
00:59:35,239 --> 00:59:36,769
Can't you tell us first?

1842
00:59:36,939 --> 00:59:38,008
One person will fly.

1843
00:59:38,009 --> 00:59:39,568
Can't you tell us first?

1844
00:59:39,569 --> 00:59:41,338
I am sorry. I don't know who it will be.

1845
00:59:41,339 --> 00:59:43,347
- Please tell us the number. - Here we go.

1846
00:59:43,538 --> 00:59:44,577
Three.

1847
00:59:44,578 --> 00:59:45,677
(The cube is ready.)

1848
00:59:45,678 --> 00:59:47,381
- Two. - Please.

1849
00:59:48,578 --> 00:59:51,747
(Will someone with the Chance Card get eliminated?)

1850
00:59:51,748 --> 00:59:53,075
One. Launch it.

1851
00:59:53,288 --> 00:59:54,992
(The cube is launched.)

1852
00:59:57,618 --> 01:00:00,057
- Is it Jong Kook? - Is it Jong Kook?

1853
01:00:00,058 --> 01:00:02,557
(The cube flies towards Jong Kook.)

1854
01:00:02,558 --> 01:00:03,628
Is it Jong Kook?

1855
01:00:03,629 --> 01:00:06,791
(Jong Kook, the one with Chance Card gets eliminated.)

1856
01:00:08,368 --> 01:00:11,537
(Se Chan picked 4.)

1857
01:00:11,538 --> 01:00:13,650
(Jong Kook was standing on Platform 4.)

1858
01:00:15,538 --> 01:00:17,637
(The powerful cube makes even the ace member fly.)

1859
01:00:17,638 --> 01:00:19,006
Is Jong Kook out?

1860
01:00:19,078 --> 01:00:21,118
- Was it five? - Is Jong Kook out?

1861
01:00:21,748 --> 01:00:23,577
- Was it four? - I was going to move.

1862
01:00:23,578 --> 01:00:24,598
What was the number?

1863
01:00:25,489 --> 01:00:26,918
I was going to move.

1864
01:00:26,919 --> 01:00:28,017
- Is Jong Kook really out? - This is nerve-wracking.

1865
01:00:28,018 --> 01:00:31,088
- This is so nerve-wracking. - I feel like I am going to die.

1866
01:00:31,089 --> 01:00:32,157
My heart is beating so fast.

1867
01:00:32,158 --> 01:00:33,923
I was going to go to Platform Two.

1868
01:00:34,359 --> 01:00:35,379
I eliminated the right one.

1869
01:00:36,098 --> 01:00:37,728
- Good job. - I eliminated the right one.

1870
01:00:37,729 --> 01:00:39,467
Is Jong Kook's Chance Card gone?

1871
01:00:39,468 --> 01:00:40,767
His Chance Card is gone.

1872
01:00:40,768 --> 01:00:42,467
- You did a good job. - I eliminated the right one.

1873
01:00:42,468 --> 01:00:43,488
Good job.

1874
01:00:43,538 --> 01:00:45,608
Can we use Chance Card only one?

1875
01:00:45,609 --> 01:00:46,966
You can use it only once.

1876
01:00:47,468 --> 01:00:50,977
The next one is a short answer question.

1877
01:00:50,979 --> 01:00:52,070
I am ruined.

1878
01:00:52,448 --> 01:00:53,500
I love short answer questions.

1879
01:00:54,248 --> 01:00:58,093
The following comes from the third verse...

1880
01:00:58,448 --> 01:01:00,734
of "100 People Who Made Korea Shine".

1881
01:01:01,788 --> 01:01:04,848
Please sing the lyrics in the blank.

1882
01:01:05,759 --> 01:01:07,088
Music, cue.

1883
01:01:07,089 --> 01:01:08,282
(Music starts.)

1884
01:01:08,658 --> 01:01:10,097
(Yulgok Yi with 100,000 soldiers)

1885
01:01:10,098 --> 01:01:13,097
(Their bodies react to the music.)

1886
01:01:13,098 --> 01:01:15,267
(I need to solve the problem.)

1887
01:01:15,268 --> 01:01:19,068
(The good fighters, Gwak Jae U, Jo Heon, and Kim Si Min)

1888
01:01:19,069 --> 01:01:22,637
(The man who saved the country, Yi Sun Shin)

1889
01:01:22,638 --> 01:01:24,066
- I got it! - I got it!

1890
01:01:24,078 --> 01:01:25,747
- Haha, go ahead. - Sejong the Great...

1891
01:01:25,748 --> 01:01:27,378
with "Hunminjeongeum"

1892
01:01:27,379 --> 01:01:28,548
(Sejong the Great with "Hunminjeongeum")

1893
01:01:28,549 --> 01:01:29,741
- That's too long. - I got it.

1894
01:01:30,448 --> 01:01:33,550
Ga, gya, geo, gyeo, go gyo

1895
01:01:34,589 --> 01:01:35,986
(This question is hard.)

1896
01:01:36,018 --> 01:01:37,057
Let me answer.

1897
01:01:37,058 --> 01:01:38,228
(Seok Jin gives it a try.)

1898
01:01:38,229 --> 01:01:41,597
(The way he sings is too old-fashioned.)

1899
01:01:41,598 --> 01:01:44,097
What is wrong with him? What was that?

1900
01:01:44,098 --> 01:01:46,210
He ruins the tension of the game.

1901
01:01:46,928 --> 01:01:47,967
Am I wrong?

1902
01:01:47,968 --> 01:01:49,267
(Seok Jin's song will anger Sejong the Great.)

1903
01:01:49,268 --> 01:01:50,338
Chance!

1904
01:01:50,339 --> 01:01:52,267
(She finally uses it.)

1905
01:01:52,268 --> 01:01:53,367
- What? - What is it?

1906
01:01:53,368 --> 01:01:55,317
Tell everyone what your chace is.

1907
01:01:55,339 --> 01:01:57,338
- The acronym chance. - Then we will be able to hear it.

1908
01:01:57,339 --> 01:01:59,847
Ji Hyo has the acronym chance.

1909
01:01:59,848 --> 01:02:01,478
- Can't we answer? - Ji Hyo, come on out...

1910
01:02:01,479 --> 01:02:03,347
- and check the acronym. - For goodness' sake.

1911
01:02:03,348 --> 01:02:06,173
- I am so jealous. - I wish I had that chance.

1912
01:02:06,689 --> 01:02:08,958
Once she says the answer, you will know the acronym.

1913
01:02:08,959 --> 01:02:11,335
It will be funny if they continue to fail.

1914
01:02:11,558 --> 01:02:13,588
- Then... - They are capable of doing that.

1915
01:02:13,589 --> 01:02:15,898
- She might know right away. - Is it that easy?

1916
01:02:15,899 --> 01:02:16,927
(Will she be able to get the right answer?)

1917
01:02:16,928 --> 01:02:18,938
She doesn't know. Ji Hyo doesn't know.

1918
01:02:20,468 --> 01:02:23,936
(What is this?)

1919
01:02:25,669 --> 01:02:27,036
I don't know.

1920
01:02:27,538 --> 01:02:29,926
- She doesn't know. - Really?

1921
01:02:30,178 --> 01:02:32,218
- Ji Hyo, give it to us. - Hand it over.

1922
01:02:32,479 --> 01:02:33,702
What is the acronym?

1923
01:02:33,779 --> 01:02:34,840
What is this?

1924
01:02:35,479 --> 01:02:37,356
- Don't you know? - I don't know.

1925
01:02:38,248 --> 01:02:40,563
Ji Hyo, say something that fits the acronym.

1926
01:02:40,888 --> 01:02:42,623
Ji Hyo, what's the answer?

1927
01:02:42,759 --> 01:02:43,787
The answer is...

1928
01:02:43,788 --> 01:02:44,858
(Ji Hyo gives it a try.)

1929
01:02:44,859 --> 01:02:45,858
What could it be?

1930
01:02:45,859 --> 01:02:50,798
(Everyone waits for the acronym with bated breath.)

1931
01:02:50,799 --> 01:02:52,528
"You are Sejong the Great".

1932
01:02:52,529 --> 01:02:54,697
(She feeds them the wrong hint.)

1933
01:02:54,698 --> 01:02:55,891
- I got it! - What?

1934
01:02:56,098 --> 01:02:57,967
- It's not "You are". - It can't be right.

1935
01:02:57,968 --> 01:02:59,845
- It's not "You are". - She didn't use the acronym.

1936
01:03:00,268 --> 01:03:01,288
"You are"?

1937
01:03:01,979 --> 01:03:03,378
(What could be the answer?)

1938
01:03:03,379 --> 01:03:05,177
What's the acronym?

1939
01:03:05,178 --> 01:03:08,978
All right. It might not say, "Sejong the Great".

1940
01:03:08,979 --> 01:03:10,847
I got it! Could this be the answer?

1941
01:03:10,848 --> 01:03:13,347
"Hunminjeongeum", Lee Bang Won

1942
01:03:13,348 --> 01:03:14,950
(That came out of nowhere.)

1943
01:03:16,158 --> 01:03:17,588
Lee Bang Won?

1944
01:03:17,589 --> 01:03:19,119
What are you doing?

1945
01:03:19,328 --> 01:03:21,458
- It's not "Sejong the Great". - Lee Bang Won?

1946
01:03:21,459 --> 01:03:22,827
Surprisingly,

1947
01:03:22,828 --> 01:03:25,697
Se Chan's wrong answer contains a hint.

1948
01:03:25,698 --> 01:03:27,198
Really? Is it Lee Bang Won?

1949
01:03:27,468 --> 01:03:29,478
No way. Lee Bang Won?

1950
01:03:29,598 --> 01:03:32,261
You will know the answer if you get the acronym.

1951
01:03:32,339 --> 01:03:33,537
- Do you know it? - Do you know it?

1952
01:03:33,538 --> 01:03:34,608
- We know the answer. - Do you know it?

1953
01:03:34,609 --> 01:03:35,677
We know the answer.

1954
01:03:35,678 --> 01:03:38,668
Kwang Soo, is this acronym correct? Please take a look.

1955
01:03:38,979 --> 01:03:40,108
Of course it is correct. I gave it to you.

1956
01:03:40,109 --> 01:03:42,219
- Oh, I forgot. - It's from the production crew!

1957
01:03:42,248 --> 01:03:44,077
- For goodness' sake, Ji Hyo. - I am sorry.

1958
01:03:44,078 --> 01:03:46,347
- I am sorry. - Ji Hyo.

1959
01:03:46,348 --> 01:03:48,939
This isn't a hidden camera prank for Song Ji Hyo.

1960
01:03:49,459 --> 01:03:51,728
I am sorry. I am sorry.

1961
01:03:51,729 --> 01:03:54,827
I will give you a really big hint.

1962
01:03:54,828 --> 01:03:56,858
This is directly related to the answer.

1963
01:03:56,859 --> 01:03:58,082
- Get ready. - Okay.

1964
01:03:58,229 --> 01:03:59,827
Spread your right hand.

1965
01:03:59,828 --> 01:04:01,094
(Here comes the hint.)

1966
01:04:01,129 --> 01:04:02,597
- What about the right hand? - Did you spread it?

1967
01:04:02,598 --> 01:04:03,690
- Yes. - Yes.

1968
01:04:03,799 --> 01:04:06,216
Fold your fingers one at a time.

1969
01:04:06,268 --> 01:04:08,478
- What? - Fold your fingers one at a time.

1970
01:04:08,479 --> 01:04:09,778
I got it!

1971
01:04:09,779 --> 01:04:11,577
Tae, Jong, Tae, Se, Mun, Dan, Se

1972
01:04:11,578 --> 01:04:12,732
Please say it clearly.

1973
01:04:12,879 --> 01:04:14,807
- Tae, Jong. - "Tae, Jong"?

1974
01:04:14,808 --> 01:04:17,548
- Tae, Jong, Tae, Se, Mun, Dan, Se. - I got it.

1975
01:04:17,549 --> 01:04:18,747
Isn't it right? It's right.

1976
01:04:18,748 --> 01:04:20,757
- I got it. - I got it.

1977
01:04:20,888 --> 01:04:24,617
Tae, Jung, Tae, Se, Mun, Dan, Se.

1978
01:04:24,618 --> 01:04:28,427
(Tae, Jung, Tae, Se, Mun, Dan, Se.)

1979
01:04:28,428 --> 01:04:29,427
It's not "Tae, Jong".

1980
01:04:29,428 --> 01:04:31,500
It's "Tae, Jung".

1981
01:04:31,998 --> 01:04:33,528
(She got it wrong because of one word.)

1982
01:04:33,529 --> 01:04:34,854
Tae, Jung.

1983
01:04:35,239 --> 01:04:36,493
It's Jung for King Jungjong.

1984
01:04:37,169 --> 01:04:39,267
Seok Jin is incredible for getting this right...

1985
01:04:39,268 --> 01:04:41,238
and Ji Hyo is incredible too for not getting this right.

1986
01:04:41,239 --> 01:04:43,320
(An eliminated member chimes in.)

1987
01:04:44,078 --> 01:04:45,478
I knew Mun, Dan, Se,

1988
01:04:45,479 --> 01:04:48,273
but I couldn't remember the first part.

1989
01:04:48,379 --> 01:04:50,765
Please stand on Platform 2 through 7.

1990
01:04:52,018 --> 01:04:54,945
(It will be a disaster if I get eliminated.)

1991
01:04:55,589 --> 01:04:58,327
(They move carefully so that their footsteps are silent.)

1992
01:04:58,328 --> 01:04:59,788
(He listens intently.)

1993
01:05:01,359 --> 01:05:03,258
Three. Two.

1994
01:05:03,259 --> 01:05:04,358
(Jae Seok moves quickly.)

1995
01:05:04,359 --> 01:05:05,449
One.

1996
01:05:05,868 --> 01:05:06,920
Did everyone take their place?

1997
01:05:07,029 --> 01:05:08,028
Telepathy.

1998
01:05:08,029 --> 01:05:09,263
(Everyone takes their position.)

1999
01:05:10,439 --> 01:05:11,497
Seok Jin?

2000
01:05:11,498 --> 01:05:13,243
Let's eliminate one.

2001
01:05:13,268 --> 01:05:14,563
Is it from 2 to 7?

2002
01:05:15,239 --> 01:05:16,431
Telepathy.

2003
01:05:16,939 --> 01:05:18,478
(Which number did Seok Jin choose?)

2004
01:05:18,479 --> 01:05:19,977
I made up my mind. I wrote it down.

2005
01:05:22,419 --> 01:05:24,152
(My goodness. No!)

2006
01:05:24,479 --> 01:05:26,588
(Did he choose the one who has a Chance Card?)

2007
01:05:26,589 --> 01:05:28,988
(Or one without a Chance Card?)

2008
01:05:28,989 --> 01:05:30,157
Three.

2009
01:05:30,158 --> 01:05:32,458
(Who will be the third to be eliminated?)

2010
01:05:32,459 --> 01:05:34,057
(The cube is ready.)

2011
01:05:34,058 --> 01:05:35,258
One, shoot.

2012
01:05:35,259 --> 01:05:36,830
(The cube is launched.)

2013
01:05:38,669 --> 01:05:39,967
- I moved at the last moment. - That's annoying.

2014
01:05:39,968 --> 01:05:41,294
(The cube goes to Platform 7 where there's no one.)

2015
01:05:42,839 --> 01:05:44,633
(Their hearts almost stopped.)

2016
01:05:45,239 --> 01:05:47,367
(Everyone survives in the third round.)

2017
01:05:47,368 --> 01:05:48,807
- I moved at the last moment. - That's annoying.

2018
01:05:48,808 --> 01:05:50,103
See? I moved at the last moment.

2019
01:05:50,279 --> 01:05:52,451
- I moved at the last moment. - Didn't you change?

2020
01:05:52,979 --> 01:05:54,307
(Jae Seok moved from Platform 7 to 5.)

2021
01:05:54,308 --> 01:05:55,778
How did you know?

2022
01:05:55,779 --> 01:05:58,094
- No way. - You made a good choice.

2023
01:05:58,888 --> 01:06:00,041
My heart is pounding.

2024
01:06:00,118 --> 01:06:01,271
I'd rather get eliminated.

2025
01:06:01,618 --> 01:06:02,918
I was so close.

2026
01:06:02,919 --> 01:06:04,458
I was very close.

2027
01:06:04,459 --> 01:06:06,188
Is no one eliminated then?

2028
01:06:06,189 --> 01:06:07,280
(He couldn't eliminate anyone.)

2029
01:06:07,689 --> 01:06:10,044
- It's a multiple-choice question. - Okay.

2030
01:06:10,959 --> 01:06:15,037
To his eighth son Yeongeung,

2031
01:06:15,038 --> 01:06:17,517
- It's too hard. - Sejong the Great gave...

2032
01:06:18,098 --> 01:06:22,117
- a pet that was out of ordinary. - How can we know?

2033
01:06:22,279 --> 01:06:24,624
What type of pet was it?

2034
01:06:24,979 --> 01:06:27,395
- It's a companion animal. - How would we know?

2035
01:06:27,509 --> 01:06:29,487
Number one, giraffe.

2036
01:06:29,819 --> 01:06:32,164
Number two, flying squirrel.

2037
01:06:32,788 --> 01:06:34,625
Three, turtle.

2038
01:06:35,288 --> 01:06:36,887
Four, tiger.

2039
01:06:36,888 --> 01:06:39,203
Number three! I mean, let me answer.

2040
01:06:39,288 --> 01:06:40,380
What's the answer?

2041
01:06:40,729 --> 01:06:42,157
Number three, flying squirrel.

2042
01:06:42,459 --> 01:06:45,223
(Number three is turtle.)

2043
01:06:45,629 --> 01:06:48,228
(Flying squirrel is number 2.)

2044
01:06:48,229 --> 01:06:49,391
What is she saying?

2045
01:06:49,569 --> 01:06:52,363
- Please concentrate, Ji Hyo. - Is it wrong?

2046
01:06:52,509 --> 01:06:54,108
- Let me answer. - Let me answer.

2047
01:06:54,109 --> 01:06:55,478
(Jae Seok gives a try.)

2048
01:06:55,479 --> 01:06:56,632
Number two, flying squirrel.

2049
01:06:56,739 --> 01:06:58,747
- Say it clearly. - Number two, flying squirrel.

2050
01:06:58,748 --> 01:06:59,947
(Jae Seok is certain about the answer.)

2051
01:06:59,948 --> 01:07:03,589
(Is number two, flying squirrel, correct?)

2052
01:07:04,279 --> 01:07:05,447
Chance.

2053
01:07:05,448 --> 01:07:06,787
(At that moment)

2054
01:07:06,788 --> 01:07:07,942
(What?)

2055
01:07:08,319 --> 01:07:09,409
Chance.

2056
01:07:09,959 --> 01:07:11,157
I will steal his answer.

2057
01:07:11,158 --> 01:07:12,618
(Chance Card for Stealing Answer?)

2058
01:07:12,729 --> 01:07:14,228
I will pick this.

2059
01:07:14,229 --> 01:07:18,258
(So Min obtained the Chance Card for Stealing Answer.)

2060
01:07:18,259 --> 01:07:20,398
(Chance Card for Stealing Answer)

2061
01:07:20,399 --> 01:07:25,672
(She uses her Chance Card when the answer seems correct.)

2062
01:07:26,968 --> 01:07:31,395
(Is number 2, flying squirrel, correct?)

2063
01:07:32,748 --> 01:07:33,807
(Flying squirrel is correct.)

2064
01:07:33,808 --> 01:07:34,869
Thank goodness.

2065
01:07:36,118 --> 01:07:39,787
(She uses the chance appropriately and answers correct.)

2066
01:07:39,788 --> 01:07:40,971
Thank you.

2067
01:07:41,618 --> 01:07:44,258
- I'm so annoyed. - She should use it later.

2068
01:07:44,259 --> 01:07:45,451
Goodness.

2069
01:07:48,089 --> 01:07:49,323
You may move.

2070
01:07:50,359 --> 01:07:51,458
Please move.

2071
01:07:51,459 --> 01:07:53,798
(They rearrange their positions.)

2072
01:07:53,799 --> 01:07:55,909
(Platform 2 should be safe, right?)

2073
01:07:56,138 --> 01:07:57,568
Here we go. Three.

2074
01:07:57,569 --> 01:08:00,058
(Don't let it be me.)

2075
01:08:00,569 --> 01:08:01,935
Take off your blindfold and write it.

2076
01:08:02,239 --> 01:08:03,666
This makes me nervous.

2077
01:08:04,339 --> 01:08:07,408
(It's time to choose a number.)

2078
01:08:08,279 --> 01:08:11,073
(Please save me one more time.)

2079
01:08:13,319 --> 01:08:17,517
(What will So Min's choice be?)

2080
01:08:17,518 --> 01:08:20,955
(Platform number 2)

2081
01:08:21,828 --> 01:08:23,827
(It's where Seok Jin is.)

2082
01:08:23,828 --> 01:08:24,920
All right.

2083
01:08:24,998 --> 01:08:26,803
(Gosh, Seok Jin.)

2084
01:08:26,828 --> 01:08:27,889
Is it Jae Seok?

2085
01:08:28,569 --> 01:08:30,467
1, 2.

2086
01:08:30,468 --> 01:08:31,738
(Goodbye, Seok Jin.)

2087
01:08:31,739 --> 01:08:32,891
Three, shoot.

2088
01:08:33,339 --> 01:08:34,367
It's me.

2089
01:08:34,368 --> 01:08:35,501
(The cube is launched.)

2090
01:08:35,808 --> 01:08:39,959
(Seok Jin is the third to be eliminated.)

2091
01:08:41,409 --> 01:08:42,500
Wait.

2092
01:08:42,619 --> 01:08:43,717
Seok Jin.

2093
01:08:43,718 --> 01:08:45,688
He jumped off when it didn't even touch him.

2094
01:08:46,018 --> 01:08:47,017
No, I didn't.

2095
01:08:47,018 --> 01:08:50,078
(The secret behind Seok Jin's elimination)

2096
01:08:50,319 --> 01:08:51,887
- We shouldn't let it slide. - I didn't.

2097
01:08:51,888 --> 01:08:53,184
- What's wrong with you? - No, I didn't.

2098
01:08:54,928 --> 01:08:57,127
(A moment ago)

2099
01:08:57,128 --> 01:08:59,467
(Before the cube hit him,)

2100
01:08:59,468 --> 01:09:02,324
(he pretends to get hit.)

2101
01:09:02,468 --> 01:09:03,621
Come on.

2102
01:09:03,798 --> 01:09:05,438
He didn't even blow flour today.

2103
01:09:05,439 --> 01:09:07,007
It's really scary.

2104
01:09:07,008 --> 01:09:08,207
Goodness.

2105
01:09:08,208 --> 01:09:09,228
(He's such a coward.)

2106
01:09:09,609 --> 01:09:11,618
- We managed to survive. - Okay.

2107
01:09:11,848 --> 01:09:13,888
It's a miracle that I'm still alive.

2108
01:09:14,048 --> 01:09:16,425
I can't accept that they haven't gotten eliminated yet.

2109
01:09:16,718 --> 01:09:17,738
Seriously.

2110
01:09:17,878 --> 01:09:19,417
How are they still up there?

2111
01:09:19,418 --> 01:09:21,417
- There's more luck involved. - Right.

2112
01:09:21,418 --> 01:09:22,816
- Correct answers aren't important. - Here we go.

2113
01:09:22,958 --> 01:09:25,713
The childhood name of Gojong of Korea was...

2114
01:09:25,729 --> 01:09:26,952
Dog Poop.

2115
01:09:27,289 --> 01:09:29,427
Minister Hwang Hwi's childhood name was...

2116
01:09:29,428 --> 01:09:30,597
Pig.

2117
01:09:30,598 --> 01:09:31,955
- "Pig"? - Pig.

2118
01:09:32,098 --> 01:09:34,169
We can't answer this question.

2119
01:09:34,729 --> 01:09:35,922
In that case,

2120
01:09:36,298 --> 01:09:39,038
what's the childhood name of Sejong the Great?

2121
01:09:39,039 --> 01:09:40,436
This is difficult.

2122
01:09:40,808 --> 01:09:41,931
Let me answer.

2123
01:09:42,008 --> 01:09:43,078
Dog Poop.

2124
01:09:43,079 --> 01:09:45,137
(Dog Poop?)

2125
01:09:45,138 --> 01:09:47,007
- It's been said. - It's been said.

2126
01:09:47,008 --> 01:09:48,177
What on earth?

2127
01:09:48,178 --> 01:09:50,347
- Is she okay? - Seriously.

2128
01:09:50,348 --> 01:09:51,808
I'm worried about her.

2129
01:09:52,689 --> 01:09:54,015
She's repeating what she heard.

2130
01:09:54,348 --> 01:09:56,022
I'm sorry. I was thinking only that.

2131
01:09:56,359 --> 01:09:57,644
Let me answer. Chil Deuk.

2132
01:09:58,119 --> 01:10:00,914
For your information, Sejong the Great was...

2133
01:10:00,958 --> 01:10:02,858
the third youngest son.

2134
01:10:02,859 --> 01:10:04,082
(It's a key hint.)

2135
01:10:04,329 --> 01:10:05,491
Let me answer.

2136
01:10:06,098 --> 01:10:07,427
It's The Youngest.

2137
01:10:07,428 --> 01:10:09,509
(His answer is The Youngest.)

2138
01:10:09,539 --> 01:10:11,538
- Say it clearly. - The Youngest.

2139
01:10:11,569 --> 01:10:12,762
"The Youngest" is incorrect.

2140
01:10:12,939 --> 01:10:14,029
Let me answer.

2141
01:10:14,369 --> 01:10:16,278
(Ji Hyo tries again.)

2142
01:10:16,279 --> 01:10:18,748
(It's obvious that she doesn't know the answer.)

2143
01:10:18,749 --> 01:10:21,148
Mak Dong?

2144
01:10:21,149 --> 01:10:22,239
Say it clearly.

2145
01:10:22,279 --> 01:10:23,605
- Mak Dong? - "Mak"?

2146
01:10:24,348 --> 01:10:25,717
- Ttong. - "Ttong"?

2147
01:10:25,718 --> 01:10:27,320
- Dong. - Which one is it?

2148
01:10:27,548 --> 01:10:28,557
(Is it Mak Dong or Mak Ttong?)

2149
01:10:28,558 --> 01:10:29,844
Is it Dong or Ttong?

2150
01:10:30,689 --> 01:10:32,457
- Dong. - "Dong"?

2151
01:10:32,458 --> 01:10:33,683
- "Mak Dong"? - Yes.

2152
01:10:34,088 --> 01:10:35,087
It's correct.

2153
01:10:35,088 --> 01:10:37,358
(Mak Dong is correct.)

2154
01:10:37,359 --> 01:10:38,694
Is it Mak Dong?

2155
01:10:39,428 --> 01:10:40,927
That was so close.

2156
01:10:40,928 --> 01:10:42,469
(He almost had the answer.)

2157
01:10:43,239 --> 01:10:44,767
It's impossible to guess.

2158
01:10:44,768 --> 01:10:46,165
(How can we know it?)

2159
01:10:46,308 --> 01:10:48,778
(Ji Hyo picks Platform 6.)

2160
01:10:48,779 --> 01:10:51,023
(Se Chan is at Platform 6.)

2161
01:10:51,039 --> 01:10:52,884
- Launch. - It must be my end.

2162
01:10:52,949 --> 01:10:54,132
Here it is.

2163
01:10:55,109 --> 01:10:57,648
(I'll be leaving first.)

2164
01:10:57,649 --> 01:11:00,587
(I enjoyed our time together.)

2165
01:11:00,588 --> 01:11:01,957
(Se Chan is the fourth to be eliminated.)

2166
01:11:01,958 --> 01:11:03,288
I still lasted long.

2167
01:11:03,289 --> 01:11:04,410
(I enjoyed it.)

2168
01:11:05,359 --> 01:11:06,887
- Now... - We lasted long.

2169
01:11:06,888 --> 01:11:08,858
- I'm getting greedy. - Let's go.

2170
01:11:08,859 --> 01:11:10,828
- I'm getting greedy too. - I'm getting greedy.

2171
01:11:10,829 --> 01:11:12,807
- Let's go. - I can do this.

2172
01:11:12,928 --> 01:11:14,092
This is great.

2173
01:11:14,268 --> 01:11:15,462
Here's your next question.

2174
01:11:16,069 --> 01:11:17,262
Sejong the Great is...

2175
01:11:17,838 --> 01:11:19,807
known for his sense of absolute pitch.

2176
01:11:19,808 --> 01:11:20,967
Really?

2177
01:11:20,968 --> 01:11:22,845
The original was a Chinese traditional instrument.

2178
01:11:23,208 --> 01:11:25,391
It was imported during Goryeo dynasty.

2179
01:11:25,909 --> 01:11:28,408
In the ninth year of Sejong, for the first time,

2180
01:11:28,409 --> 01:11:29,877
it was made as a Korean instrument.

2181
01:11:29,878 --> 01:11:32,061
What is the name of this instrument?

2182
01:11:32,518 --> 01:11:34,488
Number one, haegeum.

2183
01:11:35,289 --> 01:11:37,329
Number two, ajaeng.

2184
01:11:38,018 --> 01:11:39,763
Number three, gayageum.

2185
01:11:40,388 --> 01:11:42,266
- Number four, pyeongyeong. - Let me answer.

2186
01:11:43,058 --> 01:11:44,158
Number four, pyeongyeong.

2187
01:11:44,159 --> 01:11:46,677
(He's 100 percent certain.)

2188
01:11:47,229 --> 01:11:48,738
(He said the answer with confidence.)

2189
01:11:48,739 --> 01:11:51,962
(Will the answer be correct?)

2190
01:11:52,008 --> 01:11:53,090
It's correct.

2191
01:11:53,609 --> 01:11:56,026
I got it.

2192
01:11:57,039 --> 01:11:58,201
Really?

2193
01:11:58,848 --> 01:12:01,047
- What's the answer? - Pyeongyeong.

2194
01:12:01,048 --> 01:12:03,018
Pyeongyeong. It's the one that jangles.

2195
01:12:03,218 --> 01:12:04,504
Is it the sound we hear at a temple?

2196
01:12:04,718 --> 01:12:06,887
It's good to eliminate Haha.

2197
01:12:06,888 --> 01:12:07,887
Haven't he used his Chance Card yet?

2198
01:12:07,888 --> 01:12:09,118
(Jae Seok's target is Haha.)

2199
01:12:09,119 --> 01:12:12,934
(Haha still has his Chance Card.)

2200
01:12:13,758 --> 01:12:15,564
I have to eliminate Haha.

2201
01:12:15,999 --> 01:12:17,427
- 3, 4, 5, 6. - Please stand.

2202
01:12:18,399 --> 01:12:21,152
(Jae Seok picks a number.)

2203
01:12:22,039 --> 01:12:23,167
Here we go.

2204
01:12:23,168 --> 01:12:24,220
(Who will be the fifth to be eliminated?)

2205
01:12:24,399 --> 01:12:26,707
(Will it be Haha with a Chance Card?)

2206
01:12:26,708 --> 01:12:28,837
(Will it be 1 of the 2 who used their Chance Card?)

2207
01:12:28,838 --> 01:12:29,908
Launch.

2208
01:12:29,909 --> 01:12:31,917
(The cube is launched.)

2209
01:12:32,249 --> 01:12:33,408
(The cube flies towards Ji Hyo.)

2210
01:12:33,409 --> 01:12:34,448
Ji Hyo.

2211
01:12:34,449 --> 01:12:35,539
(The cube flies towards Ji Hyo.)

2212
01:12:35,848 --> 01:12:38,164
(The fifth to be eliminated is Ji Hyo.)

2213
01:12:38,518 --> 01:12:40,188
(How did I survive until now?)

2214
01:12:40,189 --> 01:12:41,270
This is crazy.

2215
01:12:42,159 --> 01:12:44,709
How can he succeed when he didn't answer a question?

2216
01:12:45,888 --> 01:12:48,276
I feel very greedy.

2217
01:12:48,289 --> 01:12:49,890
Haha might win.

2218
01:12:50,428 --> 01:12:52,061
We don't know yet.

2219
01:12:52,268 --> 01:12:53,492
I feel very greedy.

2220
01:12:53,699 --> 01:12:54,967
We must eliminate Haha no matter what.

2221
01:12:54,968 --> 01:12:57,040
- I want to be eliminated. - Listen carefully.

2222
01:12:57,168 --> 01:12:58,267
It's a multiple-choice question.

2223
01:12:58,268 --> 01:12:59,942
Among subordinates of Sejong the Great,

2224
01:13:00,039 --> 01:13:03,170
one of them gave him a headache.

2225
01:13:03,638 --> 01:13:05,877
There is a myth that...

2226
01:13:05,878 --> 01:13:08,717
his name became a word that means...

2227
01:13:08,718 --> 01:13:10,381
something wrong or displeasing.

2228
01:13:10,579 --> 01:13:13,343
What is the subordinate's name?

2229
01:13:13,918 --> 01:13:16,408
Number one, Go Yak Hae.

2230
01:13:16,588 --> 01:13:18,455
Number two, Go Yak Han.

2231
01:13:19,058 --> 01:13:20,996
Number three, Moo Rae Hae.

2232
01:13:21,458 --> 01:13:22,998
Number four, Moo Rae Han.

2233
01:13:22,999 --> 01:13:24,079
- Let me answer. - Let me answer.

2234
01:13:24,628 --> 01:13:25,728
Moo Rae Han.

2235
01:13:25,729 --> 01:13:27,028
- Which number? - Number four, Moo Rae Han.

2236
01:13:27,029 --> 01:13:28,167
(Number four is incorrect.)

2237
01:13:28,168 --> 01:13:29,297
Let me answer.

2238
01:13:29,298 --> 01:13:31,038
- Number one, Go Yak Hae. - Correct.

2239
01:13:31,039 --> 01:13:32,068
(Go Yak Hae is correct.)

2240
01:13:32,069 --> 01:13:33,130
You got it.

2241
01:13:33,569 --> 01:13:34,996
Number one, Go Yak Hae.

2242
01:13:35,739 --> 01:13:37,207
(Though So Min is a weak player,)

2243
01:13:37,208 --> 01:13:39,217
(she answered two.)

2244
01:13:42,418 --> 01:13:43,948
This is so upsetting.

2245
01:13:44,218 --> 01:13:45,248
Which number should I choose?

2246
01:13:45,249 --> 01:13:46,547
I answered another one.

2247
01:13:46,548 --> 01:13:47,773
(She's proud of herself.)

2248
01:13:48,189 --> 01:13:49,818
Stand from 4 to 6.

2249
01:13:49,819 --> 01:13:51,658
(They pick a platform from 4 to 6.)

2250
01:13:51,659 --> 01:13:54,953
(They can avoid the cube if they pick a good number.)

2251
01:13:55,458 --> 01:13:58,723
(I'm determined to eliminate one person.)

2252
01:13:59,668 --> 01:14:00,868
Please take your position.

2253
01:14:00,869 --> 01:14:02,137
(Right before the time is up,)

2254
01:14:02,138 --> 01:14:05,267
(Haha changes his position slowly.)

2255
01:14:05,268 --> 01:14:06,408
(Position is rearranged.)

2256
01:14:06,409 --> 01:14:07,489
Time is up, So Min.

2257
01:14:09,138 --> 01:14:11,377
(She has a chance to eliminate one person.)

2258
01:14:11,378 --> 01:14:14,248
(It's her golden opportunity.)

2259
01:14:14,249 --> 01:14:17,648
(Which number did So Min pick?)

2260
01:14:17,649 --> 01:14:18,788
It'll be his fate.

2261
01:14:18,789 --> 01:14:20,288
(It's what Jae Seok wrote earlier.)

2262
01:14:20,289 --> 01:14:24,188
(Number 6?)

2263
01:14:24,189 --> 01:14:25,358
It'll be his fate.

2264
01:14:25,359 --> 01:14:26,927
(Standing at Platform 6 is Jae Seok.)

2265
01:14:26,928 --> 01:14:28,528
I picked what was written here.

2266
01:14:28,529 --> 01:14:29,855
(It's Jae Seok.)

2267
01:14:30,699 --> 01:14:33,045
(Why does she looking at me?)

2268
01:14:33,829 --> 01:14:35,633
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

2269
01:14:36,098 --> 01:14:37,267
Launch.

2270
01:14:37,268 --> 01:14:38,422
(The cube is launched.)

2271
01:14:40,208 --> 01:14:42,931
(He only needed to last a little longer.)

2272
01:14:43,008 --> 01:14:45,599
(Jae Seok is the sixth to be eliminated.)

2273
01:14:45,779 --> 01:14:47,482
- I feel really greedy. - It's worth playing.

2274
01:14:47,548 --> 01:14:48,905
It's really worth playing.

2275
01:14:49,218 --> 01:14:50,478
It's worth playing.

2276
01:14:50,479 --> 01:14:53,047
- Okay. - It's worth playing today.

2277
01:14:53,048 --> 01:14:54,788
I didn't know he was good at quizzes.

2278
01:14:54,789 --> 01:14:56,043
He really is.

2279
01:14:56,758 --> 01:14:58,728
- Haha. - Your skills are amazing.

2280
01:14:58,758 --> 01:15:00,057
You're very smart.

2281
01:15:00,058 --> 01:15:01,252
You must have studied a lot.

2282
01:15:01,388 --> 01:15:02,858
I just can't believe this.

2283
01:15:02,859 --> 01:15:04,498
How can the two of them still be up there?

2284
01:15:04,499 --> 01:15:05,998
The funniest is...

2285
01:15:05,999 --> 01:15:07,254
Haha.

2286
01:15:07,428 --> 01:15:08,868
Did he answer any question?

2287
01:15:08,869 --> 01:15:10,068
He didn't answer any.

2288
01:15:10,069 --> 01:15:12,167
- He was just standing. - Right.

2289
01:15:12,168 --> 01:15:14,507
- How long has he been standing? - Seriously.

2290
01:15:14,508 --> 01:15:16,438
I participated in many quiz contests,

2291
01:15:16,439 --> 01:15:18,038
but this has never happened.

2292
01:15:18,039 --> 01:15:20,293
I never saw anyone small yet big.

2293
01:15:20,649 --> 01:15:22,555
She's giant compared to me.

2294
01:15:22,678 --> 01:15:24,818
This could be the last question.

2295
01:15:24,819 --> 01:15:26,482
Here it is.

2296
01:15:26,888 --> 01:15:28,011
Among the given choices,

2297
01:15:28,588 --> 01:15:33,228
which anecdote is not related to Sejong the Great?

2298
01:15:33,229 --> 01:15:35,728
Number one, when there was no meat on the table,

2299
01:15:35,729 --> 01:15:37,769
he pretended to be sick and pass out.

2300
01:15:37,798 --> 01:15:41,467
Number two, he gave a tangerine...

2301
01:15:41,468 --> 01:15:42,767
to a concubine he liked.

2302
01:15:42,768 --> 01:15:46,368
Number three, he lived in a thatched house for two years.

2303
01:15:46,369 --> 01:15:50,637
Number four, when he drank a lot, he would cry.

2304
01:15:50,638 --> 01:15:51,877
- Let me answer. - What's the answer?

2305
01:15:51,878 --> 01:15:52,948
(So Min gives a try.)

2306
01:15:52,949 --> 01:15:55,677
Number three, he lived in a thatched house for two years.

2307
01:15:55,678 --> 01:15:59,248
(So Min thinks number 3 is correct.)

2308
01:15:59,249 --> 01:16:00,718
- I just guessed. - Let me answer.

2309
01:16:01,048 --> 01:16:02,217
Here it comes.

2310
01:16:02,218 --> 01:16:03,358
(Haha makes an attempt.)

2311
01:16:03,359 --> 01:16:04,541
Number two, tangerine.

2312
01:16:04,758 --> 01:16:06,328
Say the exact answer.

2313
01:16:06,329 --> 01:16:09,557
He gave a tangerine to a concubine that he liked.

2314
01:16:09,558 --> 01:16:11,057
(Number two, he gave a tangerine to a concubine he liked.)

2315
01:16:11,058 --> 01:16:13,068
(Haha waited for this moment to answer this one question.)

2316
01:16:13,069 --> 01:16:15,028
- Haha. - Haha might win.

2317
01:16:15,029 --> 01:16:20,967
(Will he be able to win by answering one question?)

2318
01:16:20,968 --> 01:16:22,238
(Number 2 is incorrect.)

2319
01:16:22,239 --> 01:16:23,307
- Let me answer. - Let me answer.

2320
01:16:23,308 --> 01:16:24,307
Haha.

2321
01:16:24,308 --> 01:16:25,573
Please.

2322
01:16:25,979 --> 01:16:28,608
(Haha shouted earlier than So Min.)

2323
01:16:28,609 --> 01:16:30,248
No, didn't we call at the same time?

2324
01:16:30,249 --> 01:16:31,677
We called at the same time.

2325
01:16:31,678 --> 01:16:33,525
(If he answers wrong, So Min can get the correct answer.)

2326
01:16:35,319 --> 01:16:36,890
It's either number 1 or 4.

2327
01:16:37,018 --> 01:16:39,375
Whether they memorized the answer is important.

2328
01:16:39,729 --> 01:16:41,028
(Which anecdote is not related to Sejong the Great?)

2329
01:16:41,029 --> 01:16:42,079
Number four.

2330
01:16:42,458 --> 01:16:44,557
"When he drank a lot, he would cry."

2331
01:16:44,558 --> 01:16:46,967
(Haha remembers the exact words.)

2332
01:16:46,968 --> 01:16:51,038
(Is his answer correct this time?)

2333
01:16:51,039 --> 01:16:52,097
Correct.

2334
01:16:52,098 --> 01:16:53,637
(Number 4 is correct.)

2335
01:16:53,638 --> 01:16:54,658
I can't believe this.

2336
01:16:55,138 --> 01:16:57,382
(I'm doomed.)

2337
01:16:58,308 --> 01:16:59,377
Please!

2338
01:16:59,378 --> 01:17:00,677
(He wins a golden opportunity to be the winner.)

2339
01:17:00,678 --> 01:17:02,377
- I'll stand where it's empty. - Please.

2340
01:17:02,378 --> 01:17:03,448
I'll stand where it's empty.

2341
01:17:03,449 --> 01:17:04,917
- No. I still have a chance. - Here it is.

2342
01:17:04,918 --> 01:17:06,248
I have a chance.

2343
01:17:06,249 --> 01:17:08,387
Choose either Platform 4 or 5.

2344
01:17:08,388 --> 01:17:09,887
If she picks well, she can survive.

2345
01:17:09,888 --> 01:17:11,041
- She can. - Of course.

2346
01:17:11,518 --> 01:17:12,753
She definitely has a chance.

2347
01:17:12,888 --> 01:17:15,815
(So Min has to pick carefully.)

2348
01:17:16,428 --> 01:17:18,328
If I don't make it, we have to play again.

2349
01:17:18,329 --> 01:17:20,627
(Will she avoid the cube?)

2350
01:17:20,628 --> 01:17:23,392
(Or will he eliminate So Min?)

2351
01:17:25,808 --> 01:17:27,982
(So Min picks a platform.)

2352
01:17:28,308 --> 01:17:31,572
(Her final choice is Platform 4.)

2353
01:17:33,449 --> 01:17:37,630
Haha, take off the blindfold and write down your number.

2354
01:17:38,348 --> 01:17:40,717
(If So Min is eliminated, Haha is the final winner.)

2355
01:17:40,718 --> 01:17:46,032
(If she isn't, they'll compete again.)

2356
01:17:46,058 --> 01:17:48,457
(A number determines the winner.)

2357
01:17:48,458 --> 01:17:49,498
Have you decided?

2358
01:17:49,499 --> 01:17:50,658
(Haha picks a number.)

2359
01:17:50,659 --> 01:17:51,828
Here we go.

2360
01:17:51,829 --> 01:17:53,627
(Will it be over, or will there be a new round?)

2361
01:17:53,628 --> 01:17:54,648
One.

2362
01:17:55,229 --> 01:17:56,238
Two.

2363
01:17:56,239 --> 01:17:57,368
(Everyone holds their breath.)

2364
01:17:57,369 --> 01:17:58,467
Three.

2365
01:17:58,468 --> 01:18:02,110
(Where is the cube headed to?)

2366
01:18:02,308 --> 01:18:03,507
Three. Launch the cube.

2367
01:18:03,508 --> 01:18:05,580
(The cube is launched.)

2368
01:18:08,678 --> 01:18:11,678
(Two at the same time?)

2369
01:18:11,678 --> 01:18:12,788
What?

2370
01:18:12,789 --> 01:18:16,257
(Two cubes fly at the same time.)

2371
01:18:16,319 --> 01:18:17,746
I heard that...

2372
01:18:18,058 --> 01:18:21,358
Sejong the Great loved mixed buckwheat noodles and meat.

2373
01:18:21,359 --> 01:18:22,597
(What's the secret to the cube?)

2374
01:18:22,598 --> 01:18:24,728
I remembered that.

2375
01:18:24,729 --> 01:18:26,606
That's why I run a meat restaurant.

2376
01:18:27,229 --> 01:18:28,297
Correct.

2377
01:18:28,298 --> 01:18:31,538
(Haha won a Chance Card during a mission at the restaurant.)

2378
01:18:31,539 --> 01:18:33,767
(Targeting two people)

2379
01:18:33,768 --> 01:18:37,614
(He wins the card that allows him to launch two cubes.)

2380
01:18:37,878 --> 01:18:39,581
I think this is powerful.

2381
01:18:42,348 --> 01:18:45,918
(Before picking the final number, he uses his Chance Card.)

2382
01:18:46,888 --> 01:18:50,591
(It's a dramatic hit that he's been saving for.)

2383
01:18:51,489 --> 01:18:52,557
Haha.

2384
01:18:52,558 --> 01:18:54,587
I'm the king of quiz.

2385
01:18:54,588 --> 01:18:56,087
(Haha wins.)

2386
01:18:57,529 --> 01:18:58,998
It's Teachers' Day Special.

2387
01:18:58,999 --> 01:19:01,127
Sejong the Great's Riddle Race.

2388
01:19:01,128 --> 01:19:02,730
Surprisingly, today's winner is...

2389
01:19:02,939 --> 01:19:04,597
Haha.

2390
01:19:04,598 --> 01:19:05,807
(Today's final winner is Haha.)

2391
01:19:05,808 --> 01:19:07,038
The king of quiz.

2392
01:19:07,039 --> 01:19:08,038
You're amazing.

2393
01:19:08,039 --> 01:19:09,307
This is a human victory.

2394
01:19:09,308 --> 01:19:10,705
Nothing is impossible.

2395
01:19:10,878 --> 01:19:12,581
You gave a chance to everyone, Sejong the Great.

2396
01:19:12,878 --> 01:19:14,108
Thank you so much.

2397
01:19:14,109 --> 01:19:15,207
(Thank you, Sejong the Great.)

2398
01:19:15,208 --> 01:19:17,667
To the final winner,

2399
01:19:18,348 --> 01:19:19,748
the cash prize...

2400
01:19:19,749 --> 01:19:21,988
will be given immediately in cash.

2401
01:19:21,989 --> 01:19:23,110
This is amazing.

2402
01:19:24,018 --> 01:19:26,257
(Will it be given in cash?)

2403
01:19:26,258 --> 01:19:27,288
- Cash? - Goodness.

2404
01:19:27,289 --> 01:19:29,998
There are two money briefcases in front of you.

2405
01:19:29,999 --> 01:19:31,386
- Does he have to pick? - In one of them,

2406
01:19:32,058 --> 01:19:33,190
there are 10 dollars.

2407
01:19:33,428 --> 01:19:35,627
In the other, there are 1,000 dollars.

2408
01:19:35,628 --> 01:19:36,837
(There are two briefcases of a different amount.)

2409
01:19:36,838 --> 01:19:39,438
Pick one briefcase and open it.

2410
01:19:39,439 --> 01:19:41,467
- Seriously, Haha. - I hope he gets it.

2411
01:19:41,468 --> 01:19:42,837
I hope he wins 1,000 dollars.

2412
01:19:42,838 --> 01:19:44,837
- 1,000 dollars? - Try it alone, Haha.

2413
01:19:44,838 --> 01:19:46,685
Pick it on your own. You're lucky today.

2414
01:19:47,409 --> 01:19:49,517
(Haha won the quiz.)

2415
01:19:49,518 --> 01:19:50,547
Pick one.

2416
01:19:50,548 --> 01:19:51,677
(Will he still be lucky?)

2417
01:19:51,678 --> 01:19:53,219
- He's very lucky. - I think it's the right one.

2418
01:19:53,588 --> 01:19:54,711
I've made a decision.

2419
01:19:55,018 --> 01:19:57,099
1, 2, 3.

2420
01:19:57,718 --> 01:19:58,818
- Okay. - Goodness.

2421
01:19:58,819 --> 01:20:00,328
(He picks the briefcase on the right.)

2422
01:20:00,329 --> 01:20:01,427
- Isn't it the left one? - It's 100 percent certain.

2423
01:20:01,428 --> 01:20:02,658
- It's 100 percent. - Open it.

2424
01:20:02,659 --> 01:20:03,828
(Will there be 10 dollars?)

2425
01:20:03,829 --> 01:20:05,154
It will be written in it.

2426
01:20:08,428 --> 01:20:09,866
- Darn it. - See?

2427
01:20:10,499 --> 01:20:11,723
He thought it was the right one.

2428
01:20:11,999 --> 01:20:14,438
- His feeling was wrong. - Look at this.

2429
01:20:14,439 --> 01:20:16,207
There's a bundle of bills.

2430
01:20:16,208 --> 01:20:17,507
(There are 1,000 dollars in the other briefcase.)

2431
01:20:17,508 --> 01:20:18,938
Did you see that?

2432
01:20:18,939 --> 01:20:20,347
Congratulations.

2433
01:20:20,348 --> 01:20:21,408
You won 10 dollars.

2434
01:20:21,409 --> 01:20:22,578
You won 10 dollars.

2435
01:20:22,579 --> 01:20:24,717
The final winner today is Haha.

2436
01:20:24,718 --> 01:20:26,847
(Sejong the Great's Riddle Race is over.)

2437
01:20:26,848 --> 01:20:27,988
The king of quiz.

2438
01:20:27,989 --> 01:20:29,753
You never let us down.

2439
01:20:31,018 --> 01:20:32,865
(Jung Cheol Min, returning director)

2440
01:20:33,088 --> 01:20:34,618
(Iron Min is here.)

2441
01:20:34,689 --> 01:20:36,126
(We'll have a rough time.)

2442
01:20:36,399 --> 01:20:38,745
(The first rough task that we prepared)

2443
01:20:39,298 --> 01:20:42,461
(Running Man's 9th Anniversary Special)

2444
01:20:43,098 --> 01:20:46,337
(Running Man Meeting with Fans, Running Sweats Project)

2445
01:20:46,338 --> 01:20:47,738
(Meeting with fans in the country?)

2446
01:20:47,739 --> 01:20:50,377
(A special performance by Running Man members in 9 years)

2447
01:20:50,378 --> 01:20:52,827
(Running Sweats Concert with Fans)

2448
01:20:53,048 --> 01:20:55,248
(A special performance for fans in Korea)

2449
01:20:55,249 --> 01:20:56,448
If you lose...

2450
01:20:56,449 --> 01:20:58,517
(A shocking concert cue sheet from the director)

2451
01:20:58,518 --> 01:21:00,966
(Do they have to prepare an extremely difficult performance?)

2452
01:21:01,449 --> 01:21:04,457
(An intense competition with a special performance on the line)

2453
01:21:04,458 --> 01:21:06,228
We improved a lot in the meantime.

2454
01:21:06,229 --> 01:21:08,828
(8 Running Avengers heroes appear.)

2455
01:21:08,829 --> 01:21:11,158
(They've been working together for 9 years.)

2456
01:21:11,159 --> 01:21:13,576
(As long as they're together, they aren't afraid of any mission.)

2457
01:21:13,729 --> 01:21:16,438
(Even the contest is extremely difficult.)

2458
01:21:16,439 --> 01:21:19,499
(A nightmarish meeting with fans is very soon.)

2459
01:21:19,539 --> 01:21:21,807
(However)

2460
01:21:21,808 --> 01:21:24,408
(The competition until now was only the beginning.)

2461
01:21:24,409 --> 01:21:27,347
(The director's wicked whispers tempt the members.)

2462
01:21:27,348 --> 01:21:30,047
(Their choice can determine their win or loss.)

2463
01:21:30,048 --> 01:21:34,148
(Which members will take the hand of the demon?)

2464
