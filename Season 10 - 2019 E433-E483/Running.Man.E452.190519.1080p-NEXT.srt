1
00:00:06,903 --> 00:00:09,931
The weather is great. It's such a nice day today.

2
00:00:09,932 --> 00:00:11,632
- Hello. Hi. - Gosh.

3
00:00:11,633 --> 00:00:14,049
- Hey, what a nice day it is today. - Hello.

4
00:00:14,102 --> 00:00:15,372
- Is it? - You're wearing a summer outfit.

5
00:00:15,373 --> 00:00:16,801
(Jong Kook is the only one wearing a summer outfit.)

6
00:00:17,142 --> 00:00:19,211
- But... - He wears that outfit at home.

7
00:00:19,212 --> 00:00:20,609
This is so comfortable.

8
00:00:20,712 --> 00:00:22,141
That's the outfit he wears at home?

9
00:00:22,142 --> 00:00:23,781
- Hello. - Hi.

10
00:00:23,782 --> 00:00:26,160
- Hello. - Hi.

11
00:00:26,482 --> 00:00:28,054
The older members went to the restroom.

12
00:00:28,223 --> 00:00:30,051
- Who? - The older members. Seok Jin.

13
00:00:30,052 --> 00:00:33,010
When they get old, they have to watch out for their prostate.

14
00:00:33,522 --> 00:00:35,091
- They have to go there in advance. - Okay.

15
00:00:35,092 --> 00:00:37,691
They must go to the restroom before doing anything important.

16
00:00:37,692 --> 00:00:39,835
I can't talk about this because it's so true.

17
00:00:40,092 --> 00:00:42,346
- But Jong Kook just talks about it. - Of course.

18
00:00:42,632 --> 00:00:44,131
Shouldn't they wear diapers then?

19
00:00:44,132 --> 00:00:45,731
You were taking it slow. I see.

20
00:00:45,732 --> 00:00:46,801
Jae Seok.

21
00:00:46,802 --> 00:00:48,602
You were taking it easy.

22
00:00:48,603 --> 00:00:50,811
- We were just talking. - We were taking it easy.

23
00:00:50,812 --> 00:00:51,841
- You were taking it easy. - Come here.

24
00:00:51,842 --> 00:00:53,781
- I was filming for my channel. - That's great.

25
00:00:53,942 --> 00:00:55,311
- Kwang Soo held an event... - That's right.

26
00:00:55,312 --> 00:00:56,710
for the Children's Day?

27
00:00:57,052 --> 00:00:58,311
- Bumblebee? - Right.

28
00:00:58,312 --> 00:01:00,465
- I'm promoting my movie nowadays. - Bumblebee?

29
00:01:00,783 --> 00:01:02,792
- It was on the Children's Day. - You did it with Ha Kyun.

30
00:01:03,482 --> 00:01:05,721
- You were promoting the movie. - That's right.

31
00:01:05,722 --> 00:01:07,721
If you were wearing that costume, you should've come to my house...

32
00:01:07,722 --> 00:01:11,132
and played with my son, Ji Ho.

33
00:01:11,133 --> 00:01:12,632
- What? - That was an oversight on your end.

34
00:01:12,633 --> 00:01:13,653
Pardon?

35
00:01:13,732 --> 00:01:15,361
- Since you were wearing that... - I mean...

36
00:01:15,362 --> 00:01:17,132
Your house is not far from my place.

37
00:01:17,133 --> 00:01:18,832
- That's true, but... - It would've been nice...

38
00:01:18,833 --> 00:01:20,542
if you came and played with him.

39
00:01:20,543 --> 00:01:22,272
You've become a materialist.

40
00:01:22,273 --> 00:01:24,141
How much more do you want to make?

41
00:01:24,142 --> 00:01:25,744
(How much more do you want to make?)

42
00:01:25,872 --> 00:01:27,712
- Just tell us. Tell us. - "How much more?"

43
00:01:27,713 --> 00:01:29,212
- Gosh. - "How much more?"

44
00:01:29,213 --> 00:01:31,682
Since you wore that outfit, you should learn to share.

45
00:01:31,683 --> 00:01:32,682
You should apologize right now.

46
00:01:32,683 --> 00:01:34,481
I heard you wandered around with the costume on...

47
00:01:34,482 --> 00:01:35,676
after the event.

48
00:01:36,053 --> 00:01:38,500
- Yes, yes. I did that. - Why did you do that?

49
00:01:38,653 --> 00:01:39,822
- To make more money. - To get more attention.

50
00:01:39,823 --> 00:01:41,022
It's not about the money.

51
00:01:41,023 --> 00:01:42,561
(Haha turns him into a materialist again.)

52
00:01:42,562 --> 00:01:43,932
(Kwang Soo the Bumblebee explodes with rage.)

53
00:01:43,933 --> 00:01:45,261
- You wanted to make more money. - I have money.

54
00:01:45,262 --> 00:01:46,561
You wanted to charge 50 cents...

55
00:01:46,562 --> 00:01:47,902
- per photo. - That's enough.

56
00:01:47,903 --> 00:01:49,501
(50 cents per photo, even Ha Kyun and ESom took it)

57
00:01:49,502 --> 00:01:50,971
- 50 cents? - He keeps talking about money.

58
00:01:50,972 --> 00:01:52,001
- Stop it. - 50 cents per photo?

59
00:01:52,002 --> 00:01:53,701
- Why would you say that now? - That's enough.

60
00:01:53,702 --> 00:01:55,070
- You would've done it. - That's enough.

61
00:01:55,472 --> 00:01:56,701
- Unbelievable. - Don't do that next year.

62
00:01:56,702 --> 00:01:58,915
- It wasn't for the money. - Stop it. That's enough.

63
00:01:59,472 --> 00:02:01,859
- You and your money. - That's disappointing.

64
00:02:01,943 --> 00:02:03,309
Ji Hyo, how have you been?

65
00:02:03,512 --> 00:02:04,611
- Me? - She's filming a movie.

66
00:02:04,612 --> 00:02:06,184
- I've been in Jeonju. - The whole week in Jeonju?

67
00:02:06,383 --> 00:02:07,749
- I have to finish first. - When will you finish filming?

68
00:02:07,782 --> 00:02:09,952
- I think we'll finish soon. - Is that so?

69
00:02:09,953 --> 00:02:11,191
- We should go watch it. - Yes.

70
00:02:11,192 --> 00:02:13,291
You should wear that costume and go to the screening.

71
00:02:13,292 --> 00:02:14,962
Come to the movie screening with your costume on.

72
00:02:14,963 --> 00:02:16,591
- I should wear that to your movie? - Will he star in the movie?

73
00:02:16,592 --> 00:02:18,368
- You should go. - Yes, be her guest.

74
00:02:18,532 --> 00:02:20,093
Why do you only wear that for your movie?

75
00:02:20,903 --> 00:02:22,290
Then, whose movie should I wear it for?

76
00:02:22,963 --> 00:02:25,420
You can wear that and support her movie. You'll make money.

77
00:02:25,532 --> 00:02:27,072
Ji Hyo, give him like 50 cents.

78
00:02:27,472 --> 00:02:28,941
- Hey, why would I... - What's that jerk's deal?

79
00:02:28,942 --> 00:02:30,612
(Kwang Soo the Bumblebee explodes.)

80
00:02:30,613 --> 00:02:33,411
(He starts malfunctioning due to the heated discussion of money.)

81
00:02:33,412 --> 00:02:35,142
- I have money. - Stop it. That's enough.

82
00:02:35,143 --> 00:02:36,204
Hear me out.

83
00:02:36,442 --> 00:02:37,881
He keeps talking as if I need more money.

84
00:02:37,882 --> 00:02:39,381
- Just be the bigger man here. - That's enough.

85
00:02:39,382 --> 00:02:42,106
- I didn't do it for the money. - That's enough. Stop it.

86
00:02:42,282 --> 00:02:43,925
Gosh, he keeps bringing up money.

87
00:02:44,322 --> 00:02:46,158
- He keeps mentioning money. - It's because of money.

88
00:02:46,523 --> 00:02:47,951
Well,

89
00:02:48,122 --> 00:02:49,522
Hwan Jin is gone now.

90
00:02:49,523 --> 00:02:50,791
- Cheol Min is back. - Yes.

91
00:02:50,792 --> 00:02:51,932
(Producer Jung Cheol Min is back.)

92
00:02:51,933 --> 00:02:52,932
Cheers!

93
00:02:52,933 --> 00:02:54,661
- Iron Min is back. - Cheers?

94
00:02:54,662 --> 00:02:56,031
- "Iron Min"? - He came back.

95
00:02:56,032 --> 00:02:57,402
- Iron Min. - Iron Min.

96
00:02:57,403 --> 00:02:58,501
My gosh, Iron Min.

97
00:02:58,502 --> 00:02:59,829
You know he'll make this harder on us, right?

98
00:03:01,342 --> 00:03:02,871
- That's true. - He'll torture us.

99
00:03:02,872 --> 00:03:03,871
Yes, it'll be tough for us.

100
00:03:03,872 --> 00:03:05,341
We won't be able to get off work early now.

101
00:03:05,442 --> 00:03:07,656
- I bet he came back with plans. - I'm scared.

102
00:03:07,782 --> 00:03:09,680
Everyone, in May,

103
00:03:09,882 --> 00:03:13,147
families spend time together, and singles go on many dates.

104
00:03:13,213 --> 00:03:15,982
- There are many weddings too. - Right.

105
00:03:15,983 --> 00:03:18,721
I thought about giving you a chance for a special meeting.

106
00:03:18,722 --> 00:03:19,916
- Okay. - Meeting?

107
00:03:20,423 --> 00:03:22,942
("A special meeting?" She's blushing.)

108
00:03:23,622 --> 00:03:25,591
I've prepared a new project today.

109
00:03:25,592 --> 00:03:26,756
- Project? - What's it about?

110
00:03:26,763 --> 00:03:28,962
Running Man has been beloved by the fans for nine years.

111
00:03:28,963 --> 00:03:30,262
The members will prepare...

112
00:03:30,263 --> 00:03:32,832
a fan-meet for the fans. The project is called Nine Years of Running Man.

113
00:03:32,833 --> 00:03:34,535
(The fan-meet of Running Man: Nine Years of Running Man)

114
00:03:34,903 --> 00:03:36,871
- What did you say? - We'll do a fan-meet?

115
00:03:36,872 --> 00:03:37,963
A fan-meet in Korea?

116
00:03:38,572 --> 00:03:39,612
A fan-meet...

117
00:03:39,613 --> 00:03:42,642
You successfully held fan-meets in Asia like Taiwan and Hong Kong.

118
00:03:42,643 --> 00:03:44,682
(To return the generous love from the fans abroad,)

119
00:03:44,683 --> 00:03:46,452
(they held fan-meets in many Asian countries over the 9 years.)

120
00:03:46,453 --> 00:03:48,626
To celebrate the ninth year of the show,

121
00:03:48,953 --> 00:03:52,751
we plan to hold a fan-meet for the fans in Korea in two months.

122
00:03:52,752 --> 00:03:53,821
Really?

123
00:03:53,822 --> 00:03:55,691
We did have many fan-meets abroad,

124
00:03:55,692 --> 00:03:57,050
but we've never done one in Korea.

125
00:03:57,162 --> 00:03:59,061
First, the viewers might be curious about the fan-meets.

126
00:03:59,062 --> 00:04:01,661
I'll show you the schedule of fan-meet you did in Hong Kong.

127
00:04:01,662 --> 00:04:03,029
- This is the actual schedule. - Here it is.

128
00:04:03,203 --> 00:04:04,402
This is the actual schedule.

129
00:04:04,403 --> 00:04:06,105
- This really is our concert. - This really is ours.

130
00:04:06,673 --> 00:04:08,571
This is the concert we held this year.

131
00:04:08,572 --> 00:04:09,802
We did BTOB's "Only One for Me".

132
00:04:09,803 --> 00:04:11,371
(They started off the fan-meet with "Only One for Me".)

133
00:04:11,372 --> 00:04:12,596
We sang this song.

134
00:04:13,013 --> 00:04:14,642
(The much-anticipated first song to greet the foreign fans,)

135
00:04:14,643 --> 00:04:16,241
("Only One for Me")

136
00:04:16,242 --> 00:04:19,111
(Their singing wasn't on a par with their gratitude toward them.)

137
00:04:19,112 --> 00:04:22,693
(This magical song made them sound pretty good though.)

138
00:04:22,823 --> 00:04:24,149
We sang it when we came onto the stage.

139
00:04:24,352 --> 00:04:26,495
- We sang it when we entered. - Right.

140
00:04:26,592 --> 00:04:29,378
- After that, the concert started. - That's right.

141
00:04:29,563 --> 00:04:30,962
For this, Kwang Soo sang...

142
00:04:30,963 --> 00:04:32,900
- "Beautiful life." Do the walk. - "Beautiful life."

143
00:04:32,992 --> 00:04:35,402
I will stay by your side

144
00:04:35,403 --> 00:04:36,862
(He's very embarrassed.)

145
00:04:39,503 --> 00:04:43,929
(Only fans can put up with Kwang Soo's terrible high notes.)

146
00:04:45,172 --> 00:04:47,312
(When he wasn't happy with his singing,)

147
00:04:47,313 --> 00:04:49,761
(he fidgeted with the earbuds, pretending to have a problem.)

148
00:04:50,412 --> 00:04:52,851
(He could only perform thanks to his generous fans.)

149
00:04:52,852 --> 00:04:55,882
- Foreign fans think he's a prince. - That's right.

150
00:04:55,883 --> 00:04:57,721
- We were trying to keep that going. - Prince of Asia.

151
00:04:57,722 --> 00:05:00,962
He sang his own song, "Dang Diggi Bang".

152
00:05:00,963 --> 00:05:03,166
- Se Chan's and So Min's "New Face". - They're so good at that.

153
00:05:03,662 --> 00:05:05,462
- They were so good. - Those two were great.

154
00:05:05,463 --> 00:05:07,196
- Theirs was so much fun. - I thought Se Chan was PSY.

155
00:05:07,203 --> 00:05:08,223
They're good dancers.

156
00:05:09,963 --> 00:05:11,125
Both of them are good.

157
00:05:11,232 --> 00:05:12,572
- Right. - So Min is really good.

158
00:05:12,573 --> 00:05:15,942
And lastly, we do this part with the audience.

159
00:05:15,943 --> 00:05:17,442
- This is the crazy part. - Yes, the crazy part.

160
00:05:17,443 --> 00:05:19,310
- The finale. - Yes, the finale.

161
00:05:20,443 --> 00:05:21,681
We're going to do all of that?

162
00:05:21,682 --> 00:05:25,284
We used this schedule to come up with the fan-meet in Korea,

163
00:05:25,352 --> 00:05:27,392
but we came up with a different schedule.

164
00:05:28,182 --> 00:05:29,882
- You prepared what? - There's another schedule.

165
00:05:29,883 --> 00:05:31,381
- My gosh. - What's that?

166
00:05:31,852 --> 00:05:33,249
"Fan-Meet for Nine Years of Running Man."

167
00:05:33,623 --> 00:05:35,322
- There's a lot on that. - What's that?

168
00:05:35,323 --> 00:05:36,414
What's that?

169
00:05:37,362 --> 00:05:38,658
- What? - Hey, there's a lot.

170
00:05:38,732 --> 00:05:40,231
All right. To prepare for this project,

171
00:05:40,232 --> 00:05:42,578
- we'll have races for four weeks. - What's this?

172
00:05:42,732 --> 00:05:45,252
The new performances you must prepare...

173
00:05:45,333 --> 00:05:47,515
are the group dance of all eight members,

174
00:05:48,542 --> 00:05:51,062
a pair dance that only two of the members will participate,

175
00:05:51,443 --> 00:05:53,341
a joint performance that...

176
00:05:53,342 --> 00:05:54,770
each pair will do with other artists,

177
00:05:54,813 --> 00:05:57,882
and lastly, the group performance with a theme song of the show...

178
00:05:57,883 --> 00:05:58,952
which you will have to write.

179
00:05:58,953 --> 00:06:00,717
- We need to make a theme song too? - We'll write that?

180
00:06:00,953 --> 00:06:03,681
- I always wanted a theme song. - Right.

181
00:06:03,682 --> 00:06:04,692
- I did always want it. - That's true.

182
00:06:04,693 --> 00:06:07,192
Let's talk about the group dance in the first slot.

183
00:06:07,193 --> 00:06:09,762
Is there a group dance you'd like to show your fans?

184
00:06:09,763 --> 00:06:10,861
There's nothing for us to show them.

185
00:06:10,862 --> 00:06:12,591
Yes, there is. We can do a BTS' song.

186
00:06:12,592 --> 00:06:14,265
Their song is too hard to dance to.

187
00:06:14,302 --> 00:06:15,632
- It was so hard. - It's too challenging.

188
00:06:15,633 --> 00:06:16,632
We already learned it.

189
00:06:16,633 --> 00:06:17,928
- We can practice a little more. - Right.

190
00:06:18,373 --> 00:06:21,502
A long time ago, BTS was on our show.

191
00:06:21,503 --> 00:06:23,671
- They did such a terrible mission. - Exactly.

192
00:06:23,672 --> 00:06:25,872
- Right, in the handcart. - That memory still breaks my heart.

193
00:06:25,873 --> 00:06:27,541
(BTS had a tough time on the ground.)

194
00:06:27,542 --> 00:06:28,642
(Spare me, Jong Kook.)

195
00:06:28,643 --> 00:06:30,040
Why did I do that to them?

196
00:06:30,883 --> 00:06:33,382
- Why are you beating yourself up? - Why?

197
00:06:33,383 --> 00:06:34,582
I threw them away.

198
00:06:34,583 --> 00:06:36,252
You took away the handcart from them, right?

199
00:06:36,253 --> 00:06:37,722
But their fans liked it...

200
00:06:37,753 --> 00:06:39,997
because I took off Jungkook's shirt.

201
00:06:40,092 --> 00:06:41,622
- They saw his abs. - Really?

202
00:06:41,623 --> 00:06:44,132
So their fans, ARMY, loved it.

203
00:06:44,133 --> 00:06:46,000
(So their fans, ARMY, loved it.)

204
00:06:46,932 --> 00:06:48,262
- Why are you flattering them? - Hey.

205
00:06:48,263 --> 00:06:50,601
- Those aren't your fans. - You're flattering them.

206
00:06:50,602 --> 00:06:51,671
ARMY, the fans.

207
00:06:51,672 --> 00:06:54,325
We can do a cover for a BTS' song. Or we can research more.

208
00:06:54,773 --> 00:06:55,872
We have a lot of options.

209
00:06:55,873 --> 00:06:56,971
- We do. - However,

210
00:06:56,972 --> 00:06:58,942
you must beat the staff at a match...

211
00:06:58,943 --> 00:07:00,572
to do a performance of your choice.

212
00:07:00,573 --> 00:07:01,882
- We're going up against the staff? - I see.

213
00:07:01,883 --> 00:07:03,712
- What do we do if we lose? - What if we lose?

214
00:07:03,713 --> 00:07:05,382
I'll show you the dance video...

215
00:07:05,383 --> 00:07:07,085
- of the choreography you'll do. - What is it?

216
00:07:07,182 --> 00:07:09,082
- There's a video? - I'm sure it will be a Korean song.

217
00:07:09,083 --> 00:07:10,122
Please take a look.

218
00:07:10,123 --> 00:07:12,091
(What's the group dance recommended by the staff?)

219
00:07:16,422 --> 00:07:20,531
(Running Man's Fan-Meet: Nine Years of Running Man)

220
00:07:20,532 --> 00:07:23,132
(The First Mission: Group Dance)

221
00:07:23,133 --> 00:07:25,801
(1st Nominee: New Urban Dance)

222
00:07:25,802 --> 00:07:27,471
- Urban dance? - Urban dance?

223
00:07:27,472 --> 00:07:28,728
- I see. Urban dance. - My gosh.

224
00:07:30,172 --> 00:07:32,411
(For this dance, genres play no role.)

225
00:07:32,412 --> 00:07:34,781
(You use your own style to dance to trendy pop songs.)

226
00:07:34,782 --> 00:07:37,465
(The dynamic movements stand out in this fast-paced song.)

227
00:07:37,953 --> 00:07:40,155
- Come on. - Come on. That's really hard.

228
00:07:40,313 --> 00:07:42,424
- Jae Seok, this is really hard. - This is too hard.

229
00:07:43,222 --> 00:07:46,282
(The dance becomes more enticing when it's a group dance.)

230
00:07:46,653 --> 00:07:47,947
How are we supposed to do that?

231
00:07:48,292 --> 00:07:49,661
- That's going to be so hard. - It looks really hard.

232
00:07:49,662 --> 00:07:50,989
How are we supposed to do that?

233
00:07:51,063 --> 00:07:53,231
- I can never pull that off. - Only dancers can pull this off.

234
00:07:53,232 --> 00:07:55,262
Besides, our moves aren't going to look that cool.

235
00:07:55,263 --> 00:07:56,323
(The second nominee is introduced.)

236
00:07:56,662 --> 00:07:58,801
(2nd Nominee: Acrobatic Dance)

237
00:07:58,802 --> 00:08:00,128
- "Acrobatic"? - "Acrobatic"?

238
00:08:00,172 --> 00:08:01,541
- We have no chance at this. - Gosh.

239
00:08:01,542 --> 00:08:03,410
(Let us tell you about this dance with a scary name.)

240
00:08:03,443 --> 00:08:05,212
(The dance combines regular dance moves...)

241
00:08:05,213 --> 00:08:07,150
(with advanced gymnastic moves.)

242
00:08:07,782 --> 00:08:08,966
(Flying)

243
00:08:09,083 --> 00:08:10,674
- My goodness. - We can never pull that off!

244
00:08:11,052 --> 00:08:13,195
("What's that?" They've already given up.)

245
00:08:13,253 --> 00:08:15,803
(Teamwork is the most important factor for this dance.)

246
00:08:15,823 --> 00:08:18,522
If Seok Jin falls from there, it will be a falling accident.

247
00:08:18,523 --> 00:08:20,452
- It will be over for Seok Jin. - How can we do that?

248
00:08:20,453 --> 00:08:22,221
- We can never pull this off. - How can we do this?

249
00:08:22,222 --> 00:08:23,517
- This is impossible. - Who would do that?

250
00:08:23,563 --> 00:08:25,736
- Those are gymnastic moves. - We can't do this.

251
00:08:26,133 --> 00:08:27,764
We have to win the match.

252
00:08:27,802 --> 00:08:29,699
My goodness, we have to win no matter what.

253
00:08:30,063 --> 00:08:31,500
- Mime? - This one?

254
00:08:31,602 --> 00:08:33,031
What's that? It looks interesting.

255
00:08:33,973 --> 00:08:35,981
Hey, this is all about the detail. It's all about the detail.

256
00:08:38,072 --> 00:08:40,591
(Going down)

257
00:08:41,243 --> 00:08:43,660
Hey, this is going to take more than a year.

258
00:08:44,013 --> 00:08:45,181
This is so cool by the way.

259
00:08:45,182 --> 00:08:46,610
(Dancing)

260
00:08:47,452 --> 00:08:49,869
We can even do that now. Look at this. Come here. Come.

261
00:08:49,952 --> 00:08:51,852
Come here. We can do this. Look at this.

262
00:08:51,853 --> 00:08:53,484
Sit down, and try it. Left and right. Start.

263
00:08:53,523 --> 00:08:54,817
Left, right, left, and right.

264
00:08:54,863 --> 00:08:55,961
We did it. We can do this.

265
00:08:55,962 --> 00:08:57,362
- What are you talking? - We can do this one.

266
00:08:57,363 --> 00:08:58,924
- We can pull this off, Se Chan. - You're fooling yourself.

267
00:08:58,993 --> 00:08:59,992
- One. Start. - Start.

268
00:08:59,993 --> 00:09:01,161
Left, right, left, and right.

269
00:09:01,162 --> 00:09:02,762
- We can do this one. - What's this one?

270
00:09:02,763 --> 00:09:04,132
(The fourth dance is introduced.)

271
00:09:04,133 --> 00:09:05,296
That's so cool.

272

(4th Nominee: Dubstep)

273
00:09:08,442 --> 00:09:09,772
(The dance is based on robot-looking moves to electronic music.)

274
00:09:09,773 --> 00:09:11,242
- That's not in slow motion? - They're not sitting down, right?

275
00:09:11,243 --> 00:09:12,311
It's not in slow motion?

276
00:09:12,312 --> 00:09:14,485
- We have to look cool. - How are we going to do this?

277
00:09:14,712 --> 00:09:15,803
This is so hard.

278
00:09:15,843 --> 00:09:17,311
- But this one... - Hey, we can do this one.

279
00:09:17,312 --> 00:09:18,434
- We can do this. - Come here, Se Chan.

280
00:09:19,383 --> 00:09:20,382
(What?)

281
00:09:20,383 --> 00:09:21,451
See? We did it. Come here, Se Chan.

282
00:09:21,452 --> 00:09:23,852
(That looks somewhat similar.)

283
00:09:23,853 --> 00:09:24,951
- See? We did it. - We can pull this one off.

284
00:09:24,952 --> 00:09:26,152
- We can do this. - We can do it.

285
00:09:26,153 --> 00:09:27,191
- We can do this one. - Yes.

286
00:09:27,192 --> 00:09:28,691
- We can pull this off. - By the way,

287
00:09:28,692 --> 00:09:30,992
- this one is doable. - This one is doable.

288
00:09:30,993 --> 00:09:32,291
But it looks hard.

289
00:09:32,292 --> 00:09:34,914
(Other moves of dubstep intimidate Jae Seok and Se Chan.)

290
00:09:35,702 --> 00:09:38,385
(Starting this point, they can't even copy the moves.)

291
00:09:39,003 --> 00:09:41,201
- My gosh, what an awesome vibe. - This is so cool.

292
00:09:41,202 --> 00:09:43,314
If we can pull that off, we'd look pretty cool, right?

293
00:09:43,743 --> 00:09:47,485
(If the members lose, they will dance one of these at the fan-meet.)

294
00:09:48,282 --> 00:09:49,681
- My gosh. - It was really cool though.

295
00:09:49,682 --> 00:09:50,711
They looked cool when we watched.

296
00:09:50,712 --> 00:09:52,482
The dances looked really cool.

297
00:09:52,483 --> 00:09:55,081
- Watching them was fun. - It's cool because they're good.

298
00:09:55,082 --> 00:09:57,222
Anyway, if we win, we'll get to choose.

299
00:09:57,223 --> 00:09:59,191
- We can choose whatever, right? - If you win, you can choose.

300
00:09:59,192 --> 00:10:00,821
- We have to win no matter what. - We must win.

301
00:10:00,822 --> 00:10:02,362
You'll change into the team uniforms...

302
00:10:02,363 --> 00:10:04,632
and start the race for this project.

303
00:10:04,633 --> 00:10:06,592
- We have to win today. - I must do my best today.

304
00:10:06,593 --> 00:10:08,336
(Which group dance will they get to dance?)

305
00:10:09,532 --> 00:10:10,900
- Hey, Jong Kook. - Yes?

306
00:10:11,432 --> 00:10:12,872
You won't be in an accident, at least.

307
00:10:12,873 --> 00:10:14,128
(You won't be in an accident, at least.)

308
00:10:14,373 --> 00:10:15,941
(The achromatic-color lover came back in a neon color.)

309
00:10:15,942 --> 00:10:17,912
- None of us will be in an accident. - Right.

310
00:10:17,973 --> 00:10:20,071
You look nice all dressed up. You look like a celebrity.

311
00:10:20,072 --> 00:10:21,311
You look lively.

312
00:10:21,312 --> 00:10:23,016
- The uniform gave him a makeover. - Seriously.

313
00:10:23,743 --> 00:10:25,793
- The team uniform is nice. - It gave him a makeover.

314
00:10:26,353 --> 00:10:28,260
(Laughing)

315
00:10:29,383 --> 00:10:32,222
(So Min bursts into laughter as she wanders around in the middle.)

316
00:10:32,223 --> 00:10:33,344
We have to move more.

317
00:10:33,452 --> 00:10:34,921
That was really hurtful.

318
00:10:34,922 --> 00:10:36,362
I just stood there without giving much thought,

319
00:10:36,363 --> 00:10:38,762
but Seok Jin kept pushing me back.

320
00:10:38,763 --> 00:10:41,558
(But Seok Jin kept pushing me back.)

321
00:10:42,162 --> 00:10:44,031
- When did I do that? - Gosh, that was so mean.

322
00:10:44,032 --> 00:10:46,318
When did I do that? I don't remember that. Stop lying.

323
00:10:46,373 --> 00:10:48,483
You filmed that, right? I'm sure you got it on camera.

324
00:10:49,343 --> 00:10:51,541
(So Min stood there without giving it much thought.)

325
00:10:51,542 --> 00:10:53,654
(He tightly blocked the center position.)

326
00:10:54,483 --> 00:10:56,842
(Seok Jin pushed her to the end with his protective instinct.)

327
00:10:56,843 --> 00:10:57,951
- Seriously. - I know what it is.

328
00:10:57,952 --> 00:10:59,051
He pushes you with his shoulders.

329
00:10:59,052 --> 00:11:01,281
Why are you so greedy over petty things?

330
00:11:01,282 --> 00:11:02,852
It's not petty. I was already standing here.

331
00:11:02,853 --> 00:11:04,081
Why did you try to squeeze in?

332
00:11:04,082 --> 00:11:05,756
(Why did you try to squeeze in?)

333
00:11:05,952 --> 00:11:06,951
(Exploding with greed)

334
00:11:06,952 --> 00:11:08,451
Why did you say that?

335
00:11:08,723 --> 00:11:10,864
- Come on, don't be so greedy. - Hold on.

336
00:11:11,263 --> 00:11:12,592
Why is this spot so important?

337
00:11:12,593 --> 00:11:13,989
It's not that.

338
00:11:14,093 --> 00:11:15,183
Everyone.

339
00:11:15,233 --> 00:11:16,661
The group dance is at stake on first episode...

340
00:11:16,662 --> 00:11:19,071
- of the Nine Years of Running Man. - Nine Years of Running Man.

341
00:11:19,072 --> 00:11:20,531
It's Loyalty for the Collateral Race.

342
00:11:20,532 --> 00:11:21,562
What's that?

343
00:11:22,572 --> 00:11:23,742
- Loyalty? - Collateral Race?

344
00:11:23,743 --> 00:11:25,612
- There's "loyalty" again. - Loyalty? Will that work for us?

345
00:11:25,613 --> 00:11:27,101
I'm so nervous whenever I hear that term.

346
00:11:27,373 --> 00:11:29,483
- Can we stay loyal to each other? - My goodness, look at him.

347
00:11:29,613 --> 00:11:30,979
- My goodness, look at him. - No.

348
00:11:31,082 --> 00:11:32,711
- Let's see what it is first. - Come on.

349
00:11:32,712 --> 00:11:35,252
You are given 300 minutes.

350
00:11:35,253 --> 00:11:38,863
There will be eight stops, each with a mission.

351
00:11:38,922 --> 00:11:41,921
Look at the keywords at each stop.

352
00:11:41,922 --> 00:11:42,961
We can pick one.

353
00:11:42,962 --> 00:11:44,492
- If you like the keyword, - Right.

354
00:11:44,493 --> 00:11:46,125
- get off at the stop. - Okay.

355
00:11:46,662 --> 00:11:49,061
You will win if you complete three missions...

356
00:11:49,062 --> 00:11:50,201
in the given time.

357
00:11:50,202 --> 00:11:52,801
(The members will win if they accomplish 3 missions.)

358
00:11:52,802 --> 00:11:53,872
- Three? That's easy. - Seriously?

359
00:11:53,873 --> 00:11:55,041
- That easy? - Okay!

360
00:11:55,042 --> 00:11:56,142
We can spend 100 minutes on 1 mission.

361
00:11:56,143 --> 00:11:58,418
(Jae Seok suddenly barges in.)

362
00:11:58,572 --> 00:12:00,204
Why are you so happy today?

363
00:12:00,572 --> 00:12:02,112
I'm covering Seok Jin's face.

364
00:12:02,113 --> 00:12:03,203
Okay!

365
00:12:04,042 --> 00:12:05,252
Go over there.

366
00:12:05,253 --> 00:12:06,916
(Haha follows.)

367
00:12:06,983 --> 00:12:08,122
We can do it.

368
00:12:08,123 --> 00:12:10,551
(They all cheer in front of Seok Jin.)

369
00:12:10,552 --> 00:12:11,992
(He tries to act nonchalantly while peeking out.)

370
00:12:11,993 --> 00:12:13,176
Look at him.

371
00:12:13,292 --> 00:12:14,661
He peeked.

372
00:12:14,662 --> 00:12:16,050
It was shocking.

373
00:12:16,263 --> 00:12:21,061
You have unlimited attempts to accomplish each mission.

374
00:12:21,062 --> 00:12:22,102
We don't have a limit.

375
00:12:22,103 --> 00:12:24,331
- But we have limited time. - Right.

376
00:12:24,332 --> 00:12:25,602
Right, we do.

377
00:12:25,603 --> 00:12:28,153
If you want to give up on the mission,

378
00:12:28,273 --> 00:12:30,801
pick one member as collateral.

379
00:12:30,802 --> 00:12:33,211
(They can put up a member as collateral.)

380
00:12:33,212 --> 00:12:34,211
We can pick a member?

381
00:12:34,212 --> 00:12:36,842
If that member completes his or her given mission,

382
00:12:36,843 --> 00:12:38,451
it will be acknowledged as your mission accomplished.

383
00:12:38,452 --> 00:12:39,752
(Success of the collateral mission means the success of the game.)

384
00:12:39,753 --> 00:12:41,652
- That's nice. We can do that. - It is.

385
00:12:41,653 --> 00:12:42,722
- Hey. - We can do that.

386
00:12:42,723 --> 00:12:44,321
We should put up someone eligible.

387
00:12:44,322 --> 00:12:48,921
However, the collateral missions won't be easy for you to do.

388
00:12:48,922 --> 00:12:50,800
They will be something unimaginable,

389
00:12:50,893 --> 00:12:52,132
so make a wise decision.

390
00:12:52,133 --> 00:12:54,550
We should put up Seok Jin...

391
00:12:55,302 --> 00:12:56,362
and Kwang Soo as collateral.

392
00:12:56,363 --> 00:12:57,362
(They're the most unreliable members.)

393
00:12:57,363 --> 00:12:59,036
Collateral Yu, what are you talking about?

394
00:12:59,233 --> 00:13:00,936
"Collateral Yu"?

395
00:13:01,003 --> 00:13:02,166
- Collateral Yu sounds nice. - Collateral Yu?

396
00:13:02,373 --> 00:13:04,872
If you fail to succeed in the collateral mission,

397
00:13:04,873 --> 00:13:06,571
a fail sticker will be given.

398
00:13:06,572 --> 00:13:08,181
- Fail sticker? - Three fail stickers will result...

399
00:13:08,182 --> 00:13:09,482
- in the termination of the race. - What?

400
00:13:09,483 --> 00:13:10,711
- It will be the staff's victory. - It's our defeat, no?

401
00:13:10,712 --> 00:13:11,803
(3 fail stickers will end the race.)

402
00:13:12,212 --> 00:13:13,982
- We need to succeed. - The collateral member needs...

403
00:13:13,983 --> 00:13:15,073
to succeed.

404
00:13:15,182 --> 00:13:17,892
There's also a dud stop.

405
00:13:17,893 --> 00:13:19,551
If you choose that stop,

406
00:13:19,552 --> 00:13:21,161
you will immediately receive the fail sticker.

407
00:13:21,162 --> 00:13:22,722
- That's not good. - Does that mean...

408
00:13:22,723 --> 00:13:24,222
we can just pass by that stop?

409
00:13:24,223 --> 00:13:25,661
You can do that.

410
00:13:25,662 --> 00:13:28,232
- Really? - But you must finish three of them.

411
00:13:28,233 --> 00:13:29,262
(Walking)

412
00:13:29,263 --> 00:13:30,301
- We shouldn't get the dud stop. - Okay!

413
00:13:30,302 --> 00:13:31,301
Oh, yes!

414
00:13:31,302 --> 00:13:32,331
(They cheer a lot today.)

415
00:13:32,332 --> 00:13:33,597
We don't know if it'll be a dud.

416
00:13:34,873 --> 00:13:37,392
Hey, at least you're in the group shot.

417
00:13:38,042 --> 00:13:40,541
(Hey, at least you're in the group shot.)

418
00:13:40,542 --> 00:13:42,081
- Hey. - Right.

419
00:13:42,082 --> 00:13:43,311
- How could you say that? - It's okay.

420
00:13:43,312 --> 00:13:44,752
- I hate him the most. - He's in the group shot.

421
00:13:44,753 --> 00:13:45,882
That's right.

422
00:13:45,883 --> 00:13:47,612
That was the cruelest thing I've heard today.

423
00:13:47,613 --> 00:13:49,551
At least you're in the group shot.

424
00:13:49,552 --> 00:13:52,252
We'll head to the first stop now.

425
00:13:52,253 --> 00:13:53,352
- Okay! - Okay!

426
00:13:53,353 --> 00:13:55,871
(They cheer for the last time before getting into the vehicle.)

427
00:13:55,993 --> 00:13:57,461
(The race begins.)

428
00:13:57,462 --> 00:13:58,758
- He's hilarious. - Gosh.

429
00:13:59,263 --> 00:14:00,762
Please start the timer.

430
00:14:00,763 --> 00:14:02,031
- Already? - Already?

431
00:14:02,032 --> 00:14:03,661
- We haven't left yet. - It has started?

432
00:14:03,662 --> 00:14:05,602
(Will they be able to clear 3 missions in the given time?)

433
00:14:05,603 --> 00:14:07,232
Summer is finally here.

434
00:14:07,233 --> 00:14:08,396
It's getting hot.

435
00:14:09,003 --> 00:14:10,023
Seok Jin.

436
00:14:11,442 --> 00:14:13,451
Seok Jin is too weak.

437
00:14:13,572 --> 00:14:15,541
- I'm still stronger than you. - You're so weak.

438
00:14:15,542 --> 00:14:16,982
I'll always be stronger than you.

439
00:14:16,983 --> 00:14:18,211
"I'm still stronger than you."

440
00:14:18,212 --> 00:14:19,916
I'll always be stronger than you.

441
00:14:19,952 --> 00:14:21,992
But we've never actually fought for the past 20 years.

442
00:14:22,822 --> 00:14:25,036
We just keep teasing each other.

443
00:14:25,192 --> 00:14:26,951
"I'm still stronger than you."

444
00:14:26,952 --> 00:14:28,061
(They both hate to feel pain.)

445
00:14:28,062 --> 00:14:29,961
- I'll always be stronger than you. - You'd think...

446
00:14:29,962 --> 00:14:32,073
You'd think we'd fight at least once, but we never have.

447
00:14:32,093 --> 00:14:34,276
- We're here. - Already?

448
00:14:35,332 --> 00:14:38,842
(They arrive at their 1st stop.)

449
00:14:39,332 --> 00:14:41,201
- This is it? - It's the first stop.

450
00:14:41,202 --> 00:14:42,672
- It says "Lunch Telepathy". - Hey.

451
00:14:42,773 --> 00:14:44,342
- Let's go. - "Lunch Telepathy".

452
00:14:44,343 --> 00:14:47,012
(What is this stop's mission?)

453
00:14:47,013 --> 00:14:48,642
Maybe our thoughts...

454
00:14:48,643 --> 00:14:50,181
- need to align. - For example...

455
00:14:50,182 --> 00:14:51,335
Hold on.

456
00:14:51,452 --> 00:14:52,612
There's "lunch" as well.

457
00:14:52,613 --> 00:14:54,382
- I think we can eat here. - Shall we eat?

458
00:14:54,383 --> 00:14:55,652
- I think we're eating here. - We're eating lunch.

459
00:14:55,653 --> 00:14:57,081
- Let's have lunch. - All right.

460
00:14:57,082 --> 00:14:58,492
- Let's go! - Let's go!

461
00:14:58,493 --> 00:14:59,992
Please give me an official answer.

462
00:14:59,993 --> 00:15:01,821
Will you get out or pass?

463
00:15:01,822 --> 00:15:03,222
- We'll get out. - We'll go.

464
00:15:03,223 --> 00:15:05,609
Don't say "get out". Say "leave".

465
00:15:05,763 --> 00:15:08,331
(Don't you know it's forbidden to say that?)

466
00:15:08,332 --> 00:15:11,061
Ji Hyo and I don't like the term.

467
00:15:11,062 --> 00:15:12,571
I don't like it.

468
00:15:12,572 --> 00:15:13,756
(Ji Hyo supports him.)

469
00:15:14,032 --> 00:15:15,201
- I'll... - You just caught on.

470
00:15:15,202 --> 00:15:16,498
- I'm going to become cranky. - Hey.

471
00:15:17,243 --> 00:15:18,742
(Flustered)

472
00:15:18,743 --> 00:15:19,941
What do you mean?

473
00:15:19,942 --> 00:15:21,342
You didn't know what it meant!

474
00:15:21,343 --> 00:15:22,739
Will you please stop?

475
00:15:22,843 --> 00:15:24,681
You had no idea what we were talking about.

476
00:15:24,682 --> 00:15:25,951
Okay, let's go!

477
00:15:25,952 --> 00:15:26,951
- You've agreed to leave. - Shall we?

478
00:15:26,952 --> 00:15:27,982
- Okay. - 1, 2, 3.

479
00:15:27,983 --> 00:15:29,022
- We'll leave now. - We'll leave now.

480
00:15:29,023 --> 00:15:30,073
Okay.

481
00:15:30,353 --> 00:15:32,026
Are you sure this is right?

482
00:15:32,123 --> 00:15:33,448
- Let's find out. - Is this...

483
00:15:33,493 --> 00:15:34,821
- Is this... - Fine.

484
00:15:34,822 --> 00:15:37,138
(What kind of mission will be given to them?)

485
00:15:37,623 --> 00:15:38,732
Everyone.

486
00:15:38,733 --> 00:15:41,353
Please choose one person to come out.

487
00:15:42,302 --> 00:15:44,431
(Only one person is allowed to leave.)

488
00:15:44,432 --> 00:15:46,132
- What? - They just want one of us.

489
00:15:46,133 --> 00:15:47,372
- One? - Why?

490
00:15:47,373 --> 00:15:48,972
- Really? - That's how telepathy works.

491
00:15:48,973 --> 00:15:50,071
- Ji Hyo, get out. - Me?

492
00:15:50,072 --> 00:15:52,411
- I'm not good at quizzes. - Just get out.

493
00:15:52,412 --> 00:15:53,842
I'm sure it'll be a quiz.

494
00:15:53,843 --> 00:15:55,242
- Then... - You should leave, Jae Seok.

495
00:15:55,243 --> 00:15:56,843
(They push Jae Seok out.)

496
00:15:57,082 --> 00:15:58,112
(Pushing)

497
00:15:58,113 --> 00:15:59,174
Leave!

498
00:15:59,383 --> 00:16:00,411
Hey!

499
00:16:00,412 --> 00:16:01,821
(Jae Seok is pushed out...)

500
00:16:01,822 --> 00:16:03,321
(after standing in front of the door.)

501
00:16:03,322 --> 00:16:04,622
- Get out. - Hey!

502
00:16:04,623 --> 00:16:05,652
- Go. - Go!

503
00:16:05,653 --> 00:16:07,080
He got out!

504
00:16:07,192 --> 00:16:08,321
What is this?

505
00:16:08,322 --> 00:16:09,821
All right, come here.

506
00:16:09,822 --> 00:16:12,617
I didn't come out willingly. I was coerced.

507
00:16:12,932 --> 00:16:14,636
Please close the door.

508
00:16:15,302 --> 00:16:16,732
- What? - The door will close.

509
00:16:16,733 --> 00:16:18,304
- What is going on? - What should we do?

510
00:16:18,473 --> 00:16:20,339
- Let's watch from here. - Where is he?

511
00:16:21,702 --> 00:16:23,002
What's going on?

512
00:16:23,003 --> 00:16:24,512
(He's left all alone.)

513
00:16:24,513 --> 00:16:26,171
(What is his mission?)

514
00:16:26,172 --> 00:16:30,041
The mission you've chosen is called Lunch Telepathy.

515
00:16:30,042 --> 00:16:31,439
You can do it!

516
00:16:32,182 --> 00:16:33,752
(He cheers for him.)

517
00:16:33,753 --> 00:16:35,652
- You can do it. - Please close the window.

518
00:16:35,653 --> 00:16:37,622
- Please close it. - You can't eavesdrop.

519
00:16:37,623 --> 00:16:39,184
(He obeys.)

520
00:16:39,653 --> 00:16:41,222
He's flustered.

521
00:16:41,223 --> 00:16:42,549
Please choose...

522
00:16:42,822 --> 00:16:45,531
a member who won't come out next.

523
00:16:45,532 --> 00:16:47,400
You'll fail if they do come out.

524
00:16:47,532 --> 00:16:49,561
You'll succeed if they don't.

525
00:16:49,562 --> 00:16:51,701
All eight of you need to succeed.

526
00:16:51,702 --> 00:16:54,872
(They each need to pick someone who won't come out next.)

527
00:16:54,873 --> 00:16:56,701
If that member comes out, you fail immediately.

528
00:16:56,702 --> 00:16:58,541
- So they shouldn't come out. - Correct.

529
00:16:58,542 --> 00:16:59,837
- Then I pass? - Yes.

530
00:17:00,773 --> 00:17:03,311
All eight of you need to succeed.

531
00:17:03,312 --> 00:17:06,152
(Who is least likely to come out next?)

532
00:17:06,153 --> 00:17:07,812
- Yang Se Chan. - Yang Se Chan?

533
00:17:07,813 --> 00:17:08,852
(He picks Se Chan.)

534
00:17:08,853 --> 00:17:11,545
(Se Chan shouldn't come out next.)

535
00:17:12,093 --> 00:17:13,652
(Jae Seok sits down while he waits.)

536
00:17:13,653 --> 00:17:14,691
Please.

537
00:17:14,692 --> 00:17:17,141
(Don't come out, Se Chan.)

538
00:17:17,262 --> 00:17:19,392
Next member, please come out.

539
00:17:19,393 --> 00:17:21,461
(It's time for the next member to come out.)

540
00:17:21,462 --> 00:17:25,246
(Did Jae Seok make the right choice?)

541
00:17:25,732 --> 00:17:27,027
(Next person?)

542
00:17:27,103 --> 00:17:29,842
(Se Chan is spotted rising from his seat.)

543
00:17:29,843 --> 00:17:33,239
(Who will come out next?)

544
00:17:34,883 --> 00:17:38,993
(Fortunately, it's Ji Hyo.)

545
00:17:39,682 --> 00:17:41,282
- Ji Hyo, go next. - Go.

546
00:17:41,283 --> 00:17:42,782
Ji Hyo should go next.

547
00:17:42,783 --> 00:17:44,382
- Go. - Go, Ji Hyo.

548
00:17:44,383 --> 00:17:46,052
(Unaware of the mission, they pick Ji Hyo.)

549
00:17:46,053 --> 00:17:47,551
I hope it's not a quiz.

550
00:17:48,293 --> 00:17:50,991
(He's happy to see her.)

551
00:17:50,992 --> 00:17:52,797
(Jae Seok succeeds.)

552
00:17:52,863 --> 00:17:54,322
He's liking it.

553
00:17:54,462 --> 00:17:55,562
- What? - He's liking it.

554
00:17:55,563 --> 00:17:56,858
- Why is he smiling? - It must be a good thing.

555
00:17:57,262 --> 00:17:58,302
Okay.

556
00:17:58,303 --> 00:17:59,372
(The next candidate is Ji Hyo.)

557
00:17:59,373 --> 00:18:01,382
The mission you've chosen is called Lunch Telepathy.

558
00:18:01,702 --> 00:18:05,342
Please choose a member who won't come out next.

559
00:18:05,343 --> 00:18:07,352
You'll fail if they do come out.

560
00:18:07,412 --> 00:18:09,642
You'll succeed if they don't.

561
00:18:09,643 --> 00:18:10,711
- If they don't come out, I win? - Yes.

562
00:18:10,712 --> 00:18:12,721
- Pick the one who won't come out. - They shouldn't come out.

563
00:18:12,853 --> 00:18:14,582
You can't pick Jae Seok.

564
00:18:14,583 --> 00:18:16,622
- Whom will you pick? - Whom do you pick?

565
00:18:16,623 --> 00:18:17,782
(She needs to pick from the ones in the bus.)

566
00:18:17,783 --> 00:18:18,792
Me.

567
00:18:18,793 --> 00:18:20,292
No, you can't do that.

568
00:18:20,293 --> 00:18:22,892
(She brazenly picks herself.)

569
00:18:22,893 --> 00:18:24,362
- I can't pick myself? - No.

570
00:18:24,363 --> 00:18:25,822
You surprised me.

571
00:18:26,593 --> 00:18:28,133
What was that?

572
00:18:28,363 --> 00:18:29,934
- Ji Hyo. - Seok Jin?

573
00:18:30,103 --> 00:18:31,602
No, I think he'll come out.

574
00:18:31,972 --> 00:18:34,931
Who's sitting in the corner? Is it Jong Kook?

575
00:18:35,073 --> 00:18:36,102
Kwang...

576
00:18:36,103 --> 00:18:37,642
- The one in the very back. - So Min?

577
00:18:37,643 --> 00:18:39,102
I think it's Se Chan.

578
00:18:39,313 --> 00:18:41,072
Se Chan? I picked him too.

579
00:18:41,073 --> 00:18:43,441
(They think he's the least likely to come out.)

580
00:18:43,442 --> 00:18:44,941
- Yang Se Chan. - Okay.

581
00:18:45,313 --> 00:18:46,382
(Se Chan is picked once again.)

582
00:18:46,383 --> 00:18:47,473
Please sit over there.

583
00:18:48,823 --> 00:18:49,975
Please.

584
00:18:50,952 --> 00:18:52,247
Do you get the mission now?

585
00:18:52,922 --> 00:18:54,661
Next member, please come out.

586
00:18:54,662 --> 00:18:56,421
(It's time for the next candidate.)

587
00:18:56,422 --> 00:19:00,982
(If it's Se Chan, they'll all fail.)

588
00:19:02,202 --> 00:19:05,262
(Who has just got off the bus?)

589
00:19:05,502 --> 00:19:06,632
I was so surprised!

590
00:19:06,633 --> 00:19:08,701
- I was so surprised too. - Me too.

591
00:19:08,702 --> 00:19:09,842
(It's Haha.)

592
00:19:09,843 --> 00:19:10,902
Okay.

593
00:19:10,903 --> 00:19:12,342
(The members pick Haha.)

594
00:19:12,343 --> 00:19:13,771
- Haha. - Something feels ominous.

595
00:19:13,772 --> 00:19:15,181
I know. There's a problem.

596
00:19:15,182 --> 00:19:16,712
It feels so ominous.

597
00:19:17,412 --> 00:19:20,881
(The staff is the one who's in trouble.)

598
00:19:21,522 --> 00:19:23,421
(Ji Hyo succeeds.)

599
00:19:23,422 --> 00:19:26,860
Okay. Please pick the member who shouldn't come out next.

600
00:19:27,022 --> 00:19:28,930
You'll fail if they do come out.

601
00:19:29,192 --> 00:19:31,162
Hey, who do you think will come out next?

602
00:19:31,662 --> 00:19:32,988
How were you picked?

603
00:19:32,992 --> 00:19:34,802
This is unbelievable.

604
00:19:34,803 --> 00:19:36,562
We kind of decided on an order.

605
00:19:36,563 --> 00:19:37,684
What is the order?

606
00:19:38,232 --> 00:19:39,302
Should I go first?

607
00:19:39,303 --> 00:19:40,701
- Yes. - Okay.

608
00:19:40,702 --> 00:19:42,501
Should I follow after you?

609
00:19:42,502 --> 00:19:44,642
Yes. All the cunning ones should go first.

610
00:19:44,643 --> 00:19:45,711
Good.

611
00:19:45,712 --> 00:19:47,242
- You should go next. - I'll get ready.

612
00:19:47,472 --> 00:19:49,011
I should go after you.

613
00:19:49,012 --> 00:19:50,135
Okay.

614
00:19:51,043 --> 00:19:52,411
(All three of them said they'd come out next.)

615
00:19:52,412 --> 00:19:53,882
- Wait. - How about Jong Kook?

616
00:19:53,883 --> 00:19:54,921
- I think Seok Jin will come. - No.

617
00:19:54,922 --> 00:19:56,554
Jong Kook might come out next.

618
00:19:56,722 --> 00:19:59,100
I told all the cunning ones to follow after me.

619
00:19:59,123 --> 00:20:00,491
Se Chan.

620
00:20:00,492 --> 00:20:01,991
- He also wants to come out. - We both chose him.

621
00:20:01,992 --> 00:20:03,862
Everyone was getting ready to come out.

622
00:20:03,863 --> 00:20:05,032
(You don't get it.)

623
00:20:05,033 --> 00:20:06,318
This is driving me insane.

624
00:20:07,492 --> 00:20:09,604
What... What is this?

625
00:20:10,633 --> 00:20:11,632
- Jeon... - Whom should we pick?

626
00:20:11,633 --> 00:20:12,701
Jeon So Min.

627
00:20:12,702 --> 00:20:14,507
Don't you think she'll be safe?

628
00:20:14,972 --> 00:20:17,594
Please pick. 1, 2, 3.

629
00:20:17,603 --> 00:20:18,812
Jeon So Min.

630
00:20:18,813 --> 00:20:20,068
(Haha picks So Min.)

631
00:20:20,143 --> 00:20:21,411
(So Min shouldn't come out.)

632
00:20:21,412 --> 00:20:22,432
Jeon So Min.

633
00:20:22,543 --> 00:20:23,970
- Please. - I thought of her too.

634
00:20:24,182 --> 00:20:25,580
So Min will come after this one.

635
00:20:25,583 --> 00:20:26,979
Please, please.

636
00:20:27,012 --> 00:20:28,052
Please, please.

637
00:20:28,053 --> 00:20:30,603
(Who is coming out this time?)

638
00:20:31,353 --> 00:20:33,822
(The next member is...)

639
00:20:33,823 --> 00:20:36,592
(Jong Kook.)

640
00:20:36,593 --> 00:20:37,949
They don't look happy.

641
00:20:39,293 --> 00:20:41,750
(They're relieved.)

642
00:20:42,033 --> 00:20:43,766
- This is good. - Jong Kook.

643
00:20:44,002 --> 00:20:45,931
Please pick a member who shouldn't come out next.

644
00:20:45,932 --> 00:20:48,241
- My goodness. - You'll fail if they do come out.

645
00:20:48,242 --> 00:20:50,313
We chose Se Chan...

646
00:20:50,603 --> 00:20:51,941
and So Min.

647
00:20:51,942 --> 00:20:53,543
We've all succeeded so far.

648
00:20:53,613 --> 00:20:55,112
Whom did you guys decide to send out next?

649
00:20:55,113 --> 00:20:57,082
I was the last one we chose.

650
00:20:57,083 --> 00:20:58,112
- Right. - I told Haha...

651
00:20:58,113 --> 00:20:59,681
- that I'd go after him. - Right.

652
00:20:59,682 --> 00:21:00,782
I remembered correctly.

653
00:21:00,783 --> 00:21:02,109
- One... - Hold on.

654
00:21:02,853 --> 00:21:04,021
You can't look behind you.

655
00:21:04,022 --> 00:21:06,392
But seeing how Se Chan is seated at the corner,

656
00:21:06,393 --> 00:21:07,392
I don't think he'll come out next.

657
00:21:07,393 --> 00:21:08,821
- I think so too. - Pick him.

658
00:21:08,893 --> 00:21:10,524
- Really? Should I pick him? - Yes.

659
00:21:10,722 --> 00:21:12,365
So Min is looking at us.

660
00:21:12,492 --> 00:21:14,705
- She's the closest to the door. - Really?

661
00:21:15,033 --> 00:21:16,161
- Se Chan. - Se Chan.

662
00:21:16,162 --> 00:21:17,761
- Pick Se Chan? - I think that's our best bet.

663
00:21:17,762 --> 00:21:18,771
- Pick him. - Se Chan?

664
00:21:18,772 --> 00:21:20,771
- Yes. - I pick Yang Se Chan.

665
00:21:20,873 --> 00:21:22,201
- All right. - So Min will come out next.

666
00:21:22,202 --> 00:21:23,771
He's not the type to go first.

667
00:21:23,772 --> 00:21:25,751
He only does when he's told to.

668
00:21:26,212 --> 00:21:27,971
- They don't look happy. - Shall we do rock-paper-scissors?

669
00:21:27,972 --> 00:21:29,211
- Let's make it random. - Good thinking.

670
00:21:29,212 --> 00:21:30,642
- The winner goes first. - The winner goes next.

671
00:21:30,643 --> 00:21:31,711
(Why are they playing the rock-paper-scissors now?)

672
00:21:31,712 --> 00:21:33,612
- Rock-paper-scissors? - This is driving me crazy.

673
00:21:33,613 --> 00:21:36,580
Why are they doing that?

674
00:21:36,853 --> 00:21:38,082
- Rock-paper-scissors - Rock-paper-scissors

675
00:21:38,083 --> 00:21:39,852
(They suddenly decide to pick randomly.)

676
00:21:39,853 --> 00:21:45,392
(Who will come out this time?)

677
00:21:45,393 --> 00:21:48,461
(It's So Min.)

678
00:21:48,462 --> 00:21:51,563
What's wrong? Should I not have come out?

679
00:21:52,533 --> 00:21:53,553
It's So Min.

680
00:21:53,702 --> 00:21:55,372
- My heart skipped a beat. - That was close.

681
00:21:55,373 --> 00:21:58,001
- Good, good. - My goodness.

682
00:21:58,002 --> 00:21:59,676
You can't see anything from out here.

683
00:22:00,343 --> 00:22:01,441
- What's wrong? - All right.

684
00:22:01,442 --> 00:22:04,707
You need to pick a member who shouldn't come out next.

685
00:22:05,212 --> 00:22:07,048
- You'll fail if they do come out. - Seriously?

686
00:22:07,853 --> 00:22:09,451
So Min, how's the vibe in there?

687
00:22:09,452 --> 00:22:10,451
The vibe?

688
00:22:10,452 --> 00:22:14,166
It's suffocating inside, so Seok Jin is frustrated.

689
00:22:14,293 --> 00:22:15,894
- He's struggling in there. - I think...

690
00:22:16,162 --> 00:22:17,261
- you should pick Kwang Soo. - Yes.

691
00:22:17,262 --> 00:22:18,761
- Because of Se Chan... - Pick him.

692
00:22:18,762 --> 00:22:21,132
- They don't know what this is. - Pick him.

693
00:22:21,133 --> 00:22:22,731
But they must think that the last one...

694
00:22:22,732 --> 00:22:25,201
- to come out will lose. - Kwang Soo will want...

695
00:22:25,202 --> 00:22:26,631
to come out last.

696
00:22:27,073 --> 00:22:28,328
1, 2, 3.

697
00:22:28,442 --> 00:22:29,493
Lee Kwang Soo.

698
00:22:30,172 --> 00:22:32,080
(Kwang Soo shouldn't come out.)

699
00:22:32,672 --> 00:22:35,441
We can't control the outcome. Please.

700
00:22:35,442 --> 00:22:37,842
I don't think Kwang Soo will come out next.

701
00:22:37,843 --> 00:22:40,152
- That's the point. - He shouldn't come out.

702
00:22:40,153 --> 00:22:42,397
- He shouldn't? - No.

703
00:22:42,482 --> 00:22:43,951
(Everyone believes Kwang Soo won't come out.)

704
00:22:43,952 --> 00:22:45,392
Next member, please come out.

705
00:22:45,393 --> 00:22:48,453
(Who will come out this time?)

706
00:22:49,063 --> 00:22:50,062
Is it okay?

707
00:22:50,063 --> 00:22:51,862
(Se Chan comes out.)

708
00:22:51,863 --> 00:22:53,259
You seem to be relieved. What is this?

709
00:22:54,462 --> 00:22:56,632
- See? - So that's how this works?

710
00:22:56,633 --> 00:22:58,632
Yes. You need to pick the one who won't come out.

711
00:22:58,633 --> 00:22:59,731
(They've won 5 consecutive rounds so far.)

712
00:22:59,732 --> 00:23:01,431
(Se Chan is the last one to go.)

713
00:23:01,432 --> 00:23:02,523
- All right. - Okay.

714
00:23:02,903 --> 00:23:04,642
You need to pick either Seok Jin or Kwang Soo.

715
00:23:04,643 --> 00:23:05,971
- The one who'll come out? - If they come out, you fail.

716
00:23:05,972 --> 00:23:08,072
- Kwang Soo will be last. - The last one...

717
00:23:08,073 --> 00:23:09,741
- will be Kwang Soo. - He'll be the last one.

718
00:23:09,742 --> 00:23:11,926
But hear me out. The problem is...

719
00:23:12,982 --> 00:23:14,312
The one who loses the rock-paper-scissors...

720
00:23:14,313 --> 00:23:15,680
is planning to come out next.

721
00:23:16,022 --> 00:23:17,352
They shouldn't do that.

722
00:23:17,353 --> 00:23:18,451
They're planning to do that.

723
00:23:18,452 --> 00:23:20,257
Still, you should listen to us.

724
00:23:20,293 --> 00:23:21,925
- Seok Jin? - Listen to us. Yes.

725
00:23:22,662 --> 00:23:23,761
Kwang Soo.

726
00:23:23,762 --> 00:23:25,731
- Lee Kwang Soo? - Yes.

727
00:23:25,732 --> 00:23:28,416
(Se Chan chooses Kwang Soo who likes to appear last.)

728
00:23:29,633 --> 00:23:30,802
If you pass, the entire team will succeed.

729
00:23:30,803 --> 00:23:32,332
Send Kwang Soo to the corner.

730
00:23:32,333 --> 00:23:34,471
- Next member, please come out. - It can't be Kwang Soo.

731
00:23:34,472 --> 00:23:36,902
(If Se Chan wins, they will succeed in this mission.)

732
00:23:36,903 --> 00:23:40,072
(Who will come out last?)

733
00:23:40,073 --> 00:23:42,241
Already? Goodness.

734
00:23:42,242 --> 00:23:45,822
(If Seok Jin comes out, they'll win. If it's Kwang Soo, they'll lose.)

735
00:23:46,452 --> 00:23:49,380
- Gosh, I can't bear to watch. - I'm about to go insane.

736
00:23:49,452 --> 00:23:52,352
(The next one to come out is...)

737
00:23:52,353 --> 00:23:56,912
(Kwang Soo.)

738
00:23:57,492 --> 00:23:58,931
He's out.

739
00:23:58,932 --> 00:24:00,289
(He's out.)

740
00:24:00,533 --> 00:24:02,931
(They fail their mission.)

741
00:24:02,932 --> 00:24:05,001
(Why did you come out?)

742
00:24:05,002 --> 00:24:06,360
I should've picked Seok Jin.

743
00:24:06,903 --> 00:24:08,642
- What? - Goodness.

744
00:24:08,643 --> 00:24:10,441
(He's confused.)

745
00:24:10,442 --> 00:24:12,992
- He's the worst! - I know.

746
00:24:13,212 --> 00:24:14,211
Why did you come out?

747
00:24:14,212 --> 00:24:16,112
Seok Jin should've come out.

748
00:24:16,113 --> 00:24:17,382
- Go. - Why did you come out?

749
00:24:17,383 --> 00:24:18,943
- Why would you? - Go.

750
00:24:19,452 --> 00:24:20,941
- Go where? - Just go.

751
00:24:20,952 --> 00:24:22,352
- You have all failed. - Just go home.

752
00:24:22,353 --> 00:24:23,822
- What? Why? - Darn it.

753
00:24:23,823 --> 00:24:24,852
(He's lost.)

754
00:24:24,853 --> 00:24:26,921
- Why have we failed? - What was it?

755
00:24:26,922 --> 00:24:30,161
If the person they chose came out next, the team would fail.

756
00:24:30,162 --> 00:24:31,392
So why?

757
00:24:31,393 --> 00:24:33,092
The one you guys chose shouldn't have come out?

758
00:24:33,093 --> 00:24:34,661
- Yes. - And you all passed?

759
00:24:34,662 --> 00:24:36,977
- Yes. - So this was the last round.

760
00:24:37,033 --> 00:24:38,970
- That's right. - Gosh, I was the last one.

761
00:24:39,232 --> 00:24:40,832
(He criticizes him.)

762
00:24:40,833 --> 00:24:42,741
My family will be disappointed in you.

763
00:24:42,742 --> 00:24:44,610
Why are you bringing up your family?

764
00:24:45,313 --> 00:24:47,005
- Why would he say that? - Goodness.

765
00:24:47,742 --> 00:24:50,911
Will you go onto the next round or put up collateral?

766
00:24:50,912 --> 00:24:53,211
- Collateral? - Collateral?

767
00:24:53,212 --> 00:24:54,951
(Will they try again or put up collateral?)

768
00:24:54,952 --> 00:24:56,552
We'll put up collateral.

769
00:24:56,553 --> 00:24:58,181
- We'll pick one of them. - Hold on.

770
00:24:58,182 --> 00:24:59,191
(He points at them.)

771
00:24:59,192 --> 00:25:00,251
(It'll be one of us?)

772
00:25:00,252 --> 00:25:01,622
- Why is it one of us? - Wait a minute.

773
00:25:01,623 --> 00:25:03,562
- Hey! - We didn't know anything!

774
00:25:03,563 --> 00:25:05,132
- Hold on. - What did I do...

775
00:25:05,133 --> 00:25:06,491
- so wrong? - Let's go, Jae Seok!

776
00:25:06,492 --> 00:25:08,064
- Fine, put us up as collateral. - It's 1 of you 2.

777
00:25:08,262 --> 00:25:09,562
Whatever. Put me up as collation.

778
00:25:09,563 --> 00:25:11,878
(His tongue gets twisted.)

779
00:25:12,103 --> 00:25:13,868
- Collation? - What did he say?

780
00:25:14,002 --> 00:25:16,241
- What do you mean? - What's "collation"?

781
00:25:16,242 --> 00:25:17,701
- I meant collateral. - It's collateral.

782
00:25:17,702 --> 00:25:19,812
- Fine, let's put up collateral. - It's either you or Kwang Soo.

783
00:25:19,813 --> 00:25:20,812
Not me.

784
00:25:20,813 --> 00:25:22,241
- But listen to me. - Let me tell you.

785
00:25:22,242 --> 00:25:24,612
- The lateral that... - Lateral?

786
00:25:24,613 --> 00:25:27,011
(He keeps mispronouncing the word.)

787
00:25:27,012 --> 00:25:29,552
(He can't seem to come to his senses.)

788
00:25:29,553 --> 00:25:30,852
- But won't we succeed... - Let's do that.

789
00:25:30,853 --> 00:25:32,552
- Why did you have to play... - in round two?

790
00:25:32,553 --> 00:25:34,451
- rock-paper-scissors? - We were so close.

791
00:25:34,452 --> 00:25:36,461
Will round two be different?

792
00:25:36,492 --> 00:25:38,532
- Yes, it might be. - Right, it might.

793
00:25:39,363 --> 00:25:41,092
- Okay. - Let's move on for now.

794
00:25:41,093 --> 00:25:42,832
- Yes. - But for round two...

795
00:25:42,833 --> 00:25:44,062
(They decide to try again.)

796
00:25:44,063 --> 00:25:45,431
Why did you have to come out?

797
00:25:45,432 --> 00:25:47,952
Please decide on the order.

798
00:25:48,643 --> 00:25:51,977
This is round two of Lunch Telepathy.

799
00:25:52,212 --> 00:25:53,876
One member should come out.

800
00:25:53,912 --> 00:25:55,542
- Go, Kwang Soo. - We need to send him out first.

801
00:25:55,543 --> 00:25:56,981
- I'll be serious. - Kwang Soo.

802
00:25:56,982 --> 00:25:59,852
- Okay. - Hurry up. We have no time.

803
00:25:59,853 --> 00:26:01,652
- Okay. I'll do my best. - Hurry up.

804
00:26:01,653 --> 00:26:03,009
- Hey, hey. - Okay. Okay.

805
00:26:04,353 --> 00:26:07,852
(The first candidate is Kwang Soo.)

806
00:26:07,853 --> 00:26:09,118
I came out first.

807
00:26:10,462 --> 00:26:11,482
Okay.

808
00:26:11,623 --> 00:26:12,816
- Let's see. - Okay.

809
00:26:13,492 --> 00:26:14,491
Watch his reaction.

810
00:26:14,492 --> 00:26:16,261
Why did we send him out first?

811
00:26:16,262 --> 00:26:18,132
Because he's always the one who ruins things.

812
00:26:18,133 --> 00:26:19,632
- He should go first or last. - Right.

813
00:26:19,633 --> 00:26:21,532
- It's better to fail first. - Exactly.

814
00:26:21,533 --> 00:26:24,806
- Here is the mission. - Okay.

815
00:26:25,143 --> 00:26:27,622
You need to guess with which foot...

816
00:26:28,643 --> 00:26:30,082
the next member will step out.

817
00:26:30,083 --> 00:26:32,908
Number 1, left. Number 2, right. Number 3, both.

818
00:26:32,912 --> 00:26:35,382
If you can guess it right, you pass.

819
00:26:35,383 --> 00:26:37,021
If you get it wrong, you fail.

820
00:26:37,022 --> 00:26:40,082
(He's disheartened.)

821
00:26:40,992 --> 00:26:42,350
I shouldn't have come first.

822
00:26:43,192 --> 00:26:45,172
They will put me up as collateral if I don't pass this round.

823
00:26:45,192 --> 00:26:46,632
(He needs to get it right at all costs.)

824
00:26:46,633 --> 00:26:47,683
What should I do?

825
00:26:48,502 --> 00:26:50,166
Okay. Let's just guess.

826
00:26:50,363 --> 00:26:53,332
It's simple. Right, left, or landing on two feet.

827
00:26:53,333 --> 00:26:55,342
Landing on both feet is least likely.

828
00:26:57,103 --> 00:26:59,489
There are two stairs. That means...

829
00:26:59,543 --> 00:27:02,181
They'll turn right and step with their right foot first.

830
00:27:02,182 --> 00:27:04,711
(He thinks they'll land on their left foot.)

831
00:27:04,712 --> 00:27:05,732
Left.

832
00:27:06,083 --> 00:27:07,812
Number one, left. Okay.

833
00:27:07,813 --> 00:27:08,852
This is a scientific approach.

834
00:27:08,853 --> 00:27:10,822
- You can't show them your response. - Okay.

835
00:27:10,823 --> 00:27:12,721
- Don't react. Sit down. - Okay.

836
00:27:12,722 --> 00:27:13,721
(Is his scientific approach correct?)

837
00:27:13,722 --> 00:27:14,721
(He sits down.)

838
00:27:14,722 --> 00:27:16,562
Next candidate, please come out.

839
00:27:16,563 --> 00:27:18,572
This is a scientific approach.

840
00:27:18,662 --> 00:27:19,832
- Should I? - Yes.

841
00:27:19,833 --> 00:27:20,832
- Go. - Okay.

842
00:27:20,833 --> 00:27:22,032
(Haha is the next one.)

843
00:27:22,033 --> 00:27:23,062
Goodness.

844
00:27:23,063 --> 00:27:26,231
(Unaware of the mission, he steps out of the bus.)

845
00:27:26,232 --> 00:27:27,865
(Please land on your left foot.)

846
00:27:28,643 --> 00:27:31,342
(Which foot will he land on?)

847
00:27:31,343 --> 00:27:34,269
(He lands on his left foot as Kwang Soo predicted.)

848
00:27:34,643 --> 00:27:35,842
It's not the same game.

849
00:27:35,843 --> 00:27:38,181
(Kwang Soo's scientific approach was right.)

850
00:27:38,182 --> 00:27:39,407
The game has changed.

851
00:27:40,012 --> 00:27:41,686
(I told you it was scientific.)

852
00:27:42,252 --> 00:27:44,921
(It's Haha's turn.)

853
00:27:44,922 --> 00:27:47,646
For this mission,

854
00:27:47,752 --> 00:27:49,761
you need to guess on which foot the next member will land.

855
00:27:49,762 --> 00:27:51,562
- Number 1, left. Number 2, right. - Darn it!

856
00:27:51,563 --> 00:27:53,194
Number 3, both.

857
00:27:53,262 --> 00:27:55,931
And Kwang Soo guessed it right for you.

858
00:27:55,932 --> 00:27:57,023
Really?

859
00:27:57,063 --> 00:27:59,931
Think scientifically.

860
00:27:59,932 --> 00:28:02,391
- How can this be scientific? - Haha.

861
00:28:02,803 --> 00:28:05,628
Think about the formation of the bus.

862
00:28:05,942 --> 00:28:08,971
Left foot is the most likely one. Both feet are ridiculous.

863
00:28:09,383 --> 00:28:12,652
(He's gullible.)

864
00:28:12,653 --> 00:28:14,711
- Left foot. - Good job.

865
00:28:14,712 --> 00:28:16,386
(Haha chooses left foot.)

866
00:28:16,952 --> 00:28:18,075
You'll get it for sure.

867
00:28:18,553 --> 00:28:20,021
Next candidate, please come out.

868
00:28:20,053 --> 00:28:21,622
- Just try it. - Okay.

869
00:28:21,623 --> 00:28:23,622
- Don't make it too complicated. - I won't.

870
00:28:23,623 --> 00:28:24,744
(Seok Jin is next.)

871
00:28:26,192 --> 00:28:28,886
(Please land on your left foot.)

872
00:28:31,633 --> 00:28:34,897
(He comes down on his left.)

873
00:28:36,103 --> 00:28:37,542
(Suddenly, he switches feet...)

874
00:28:37,543 --> 00:28:41,795
(and safely lands on his left foot.)

875
00:28:42,643 --> 00:28:45,713
(They're relieved.)

876
00:28:46,283 --> 00:28:48,451
They watched him as he came out.

877
00:28:48,452 --> 00:28:50,422
Their reactions are similar to those from the last round.

878
00:28:50,452 --> 00:28:51,921
- I think I know. - They watched him come out.

879
00:28:51,922 --> 00:28:52,921
What is it?

880
00:28:52,922 --> 00:28:54,382
(What do you think it is?)

881
00:28:54,893 --> 00:28:57,122
- Guessing which foot. - What?

882
00:28:57,123 --> 00:28:59,862
They need to guess on which foot we'll land.

883
00:28:59,863 --> 00:29:01,698
I think so because...

884
00:29:01,863 --> 00:29:04,032
- Guessing which feet? - They looked at his feet.

885
00:29:04,033 --> 00:29:05,940
- But we can't do anything. - You're right.

886
00:29:05,972 --> 00:29:07,156
- They looked at his feet. - Right?

887
00:29:07,732 --> 00:29:10,102
- Guess which foot they'll land on. - What?

888
00:29:10,103 --> 00:29:11,271
(Seok Jin is listening to the mission.)

889
00:29:11,272 --> 00:29:12,842
Both of them got it right.

890
00:29:12,843 --> 00:29:14,142
I got it right.

891
00:29:14,143 --> 00:29:15,978
- It's almost always left. - Pick left.

892
00:29:16,113 --> 00:29:18,812
- Think about the bus' formation. - It's almost always left?

893
00:29:18,813 --> 00:29:20,485
The staff has made a mistake.

894
00:29:20,653 --> 00:29:22,751
(If that's so...)

895
00:29:22,752 --> 00:29:23,772
Okay.

896
00:29:25,053 --> 00:29:26,451
I'll choose left foot.

897
00:29:26,452 --> 00:29:27,472
(Seok Jin chooses left foot.)

898
00:29:27,992 --> 00:29:29,221
Left. Yes.

899
00:29:29,222 --> 00:29:30,921
You can't signal anything.

900
00:29:30,922 --> 00:29:32,661
If you say anything, you'll fail immediately.

901
00:29:32,662 --> 00:29:35,362
Even if you get it wrong, it won't be your fault.

902
00:29:35,363 --> 00:29:37,749
- Let's find out. - Next candidate, please come out.

903
00:29:38,133 --> 00:29:40,377
- Ji Hyo? - Go, Ji Hyo.

904
00:29:40,903 --> 00:29:42,372
- Ji Hyo. - Land on your right.

905
00:29:42,373 --> 00:29:43,642
- Look. - They're looking downwards.

906
00:29:43,643 --> 00:29:44,795
You're right.

907
00:29:47,212 --> 00:29:51,160
(She comes down on her right foot.)

908
00:29:52,752 --> 00:29:55,981
(Do you want this foot?)

909
00:29:55,982 --> 00:29:57,380
(Or do you want this one?)

910
00:29:57,883 --> 00:29:59,045
What's wrong with her?

911
00:29:59,492 --> 00:30:00,676
What's going on with her?

912
00:30:00,752 --> 00:30:02,395
I think she caught onto it.

913
00:30:02,623 --> 00:30:06,366
(What will be her decision?)

914
00:30:06,563 --> 00:30:07,562
Don't look.

915
00:30:07,563 --> 00:30:08,858
(Right? Left?)

916
00:30:10,462 --> 00:30:11,902
(She leaps down.)

917
00:30:11,903 --> 00:30:15,167
(She lands on both of her feet.)

918
00:30:15,643 --> 00:30:19,011
(As a consequence of knowing too much, she fails.)

919
00:30:19,012 --> 00:30:20,372
- What? - Both feet.

920
00:30:20,373 --> 00:30:22,042
- She landed on both feet. - What's wrong with her?

921
00:30:22,043 --> 00:30:23,980
- What are you doing? - What have you done?

922
00:30:24,212 --> 00:30:25,711
- Weren't you guessing which foot? - What have you done?

923
00:30:25,712 --> 00:30:27,711
- You should've just come down. - What is this?

924
00:30:27,712 --> 00:30:30,282
I thought it'd be either left or right, so I landed on both.

925
00:30:30,283 --> 00:30:32,552
- Why would you be weird like that? - Goodness.

926
00:30:32,553 --> 00:30:34,652
- You should've just chose one. - We knew it.

927
00:30:34,653 --> 00:30:35,761
Did she land on both feet?

928
00:30:35,762 --> 00:30:37,660
- I think she did. - She landed like this.

929
00:30:37,662 --> 00:30:39,961
You guys are amazing. They caught onto it.

930
00:30:39,962 --> 00:30:41,661
- How did you know? - How did you know?

931
00:30:41,662 --> 00:30:44,763
You guys kept looking downwards, so she guessed it.

932
00:30:44,803 --> 00:30:46,771
But then, she landed on both of her feet.

933
00:30:47,103 --> 00:30:48,372
My goodness.

934
00:30:48,373 --> 00:30:49,542
Shall we try again?

935
00:30:49,543 --> 00:30:50,802
We'd like to try once more.

936
00:30:50,803 --> 00:30:52,271
- All right, round three then. - Let's do it.

937
00:30:52,272 --> 00:30:53,271
- Let's hurry. - We can do it.

938
00:30:53,272 --> 00:30:54,542
- Let's do it. - Let's go.

939
00:30:54,543 --> 00:30:56,282
- We can win for sure. - Let's hurry.

940
00:30:56,283 --> 00:30:59,082
This is round three of Lunch Telepathy.

941
00:30:59,083 --> 00:31:00,745
One member should come out.

942
00:31:01,482 --> 00:31:02,822
- Go, Se Chan. - Yes, you go first.

943
00:31:02,823 --> 00:31:04,021
Go. Good luck!

944
00:31:04,022 --> 00:31:05,052
Going first is the most important.

945
00:31:05,053 --> 00:31:06,122
- Seriously. - Let's make it this time.

946
00:31:06,123 --> 00:31:07,122
- Okay. - Seriously.

947
00:31:07,123 --> 00:31:08,519
I'm landing on my left foot too.

948
00:31:09,962 --> 00:31:12,021
This is round three of Lunch Telepathy.

949
00:31:12,022 --> 00:31:13,594
(Pressured, Se Chan starts off.)

950
00:31:14,363 --> 00:31:17,231
We will give you a set of initial consonants.

951
00:31:17,232 --> 00:31:19,102
You must make up a word in three seconds.

952
00:31:19,103 --> 00:31:21,372
If you can't, you fail.

953
00:31:21,373 --> 00:31:23,642
And the words may not overlap with the others' answers.

954
00:31:23,643 --> 00:31:24,663
Wait a minute.

955
00:31:24,742 --> 00:31:26,112
- Get ready. - Hold on!

956
00:31:26,113 --> 00:31:27,441
- Get ready. - I don't know the consonants.

957
00:31:27,442 --> 00:31:29,142
- Get ready. No. I'll start. - Give me a minute.

958
00:31:29,143 --> 00:31:31,223
If you can't answer, you lose. Get ready.

959
00:31:31,482 --> 00:31:33,082
Get ready, go.

960
00:31:33,083 --> 00:31:34,082
One,

961
00:31:34,083 --> 00:31:36,322
- "Good job". - two, three, get back to your seat.

962
00:31:36,323 --> 00:31:37,421
I'm doomed.

963
00:31:37,422 --> 00:31:38,792
(I'm doomed.)

964
00:31:38,793 --> 00:31:39,874
This is...

965
00:31:40,323 --> 00:31:42,363
because I have little knowledge.

966
00:31:42,662 --> 00:31:43,887
It was so obvious.

967
00:31:44,422 --> 00:31:45,452
It was so obvious!

968
00:31:46,133 --> 00:31:47,418
Why did I do that?

969
00:31:47,533 --> 00:31:48,961
Next person!

970
00:31:48,962 --> 00:31:50,832
(Who will try next?)

971
00:31:50,833 --> 00:31:53,072
(It's the brain of Running Man, Yu Jae Seok.)

972
00:31:53,073 --> 00:31:54,225
Good.

973
00:31:55,702 --> 00:31:56,866
Get ready.

974
00:31:57,143 --> 00:31:58,846
Go.

975
00:31:58,942 --> 00:32:01,312
1, 2, 3.

976
00:32:01,313 --> 00:32:02,568
"Tabor"!

977
00:32:03,442 --> 00:32:05,422
(That's my Jae Seok.)

978
00:32:05,653 --> 00:32:06,774
"Tabor".

979
00:32:06,783 --> 00:32:07,975
That was difficult.

980
00:32:08,252 --> 00:32:09,481
Next person.

981
00:32:09,482 --> 00:32:10,911
(Se Chan and Jae Seok passed. Who's next?)

982
00:32:11,553 --> 00:32:14,450
(It's Haha. He's similar to Se Chan.)

983
00:32:14,752 --> 00:32:15,892
We're finished.

984
00:32:15,893 --> 00:32:17,086
(We're finished.)

985
00:32:18,293 --> 00:32:21,495
(Is it guessing the right foot again?)

986
00:32:21,762 --> 00:32:23,160
I knew this wasn't it.

987
00:32:23,563 --> 00:32:24,959
I'm going to do it simple.

988
00:32:25,533 --> 00:32:29,042
You all have to say different words with these initial consonants.

989
00:32:29,043 --> 00:32:30,501
(You all have to say different words with these initial consonants.)

990
00:32:30,972 --> 00:32:32,543
You also have to say it in three seconds.

991
00:32:33,143 --> 00:32:34,295
Get ready.

992
00:32:34,643 --> 00:32:36,243
Go.

993
00:32:36,313 --> 00:32:37,812
- One... - "Good job".

994
00:32:37,813 --> 00:32:39,681
(Haha said, "Good job".)

995
00:32:39,682 --> 00:32:40,681
(No!)

996
00:32:40,682 --> 00:32:41,911
- You have failed. - See?

997
00:32:41,912 --> 00:32:43,782
- I told you we're not smart. - Fail!

998
00:32:43,783 --> 00:32:46,251
- Open the door. - Why did you do that?

999
00:32:46,252 --> 00:32:47,721
You have failed round three.

1000
00:32:47,722 --> 00:32:49,062
There's "Apple"!

1001
00:32:49,063 --> 00:32:50,828
I was going to say that.

1002
00:32:51,022 --> 00:32:52,521
But that was the easiest answer.

1003
00:32:52,793 --> 00:32:55,761
Round Three was not saying the same words.

1004
00:32:55,762 --> 00:32:56,961
That was the mission.

1005
00:32:56,962 --> 00:32:59,372
They said, "Good job", "Tabor", and "Good job". And you've failed.

1006
00:32:59,373 --> 00:33:01,602
- Se Chan kept telling me... - I told him.

1007
00:33:01,603 --> 00:33:04,001
that the ones with little knowledge will say "Good job".

1008
00:33:04,002 --> 00:33:05,372
Then Haha said, "Good job" right after.

1009
00:33:05,373 --> 00:33:08,011
(Then Haha said the same word in an instant.)

1010
00:33:08,012 --> 00:33:09,104
Everyone.

1011
00:33:09,313 --> 00:33:11,281
Will you give up or put up collateral?

1012
00:33:11,712 --> 00:33:13,182
We're short of time.

1013
00:33:13,313 --> 00:33:14,475
We'll put up collateral.

1014
00:33:14,813 --> 00:33:16,721
- We have no choice. - Pick a member.

1015
00:33:16,722 --> 00:33:18,661
We have to pick the smartest member.

1016
00:33:18,752 --> 00:33:19,892
- No. - Seok Jin.

1017
00:33:19,893 --> 00:33:21,991
The difficulty depends on the person.

1018
00:33:21,992 --> 00:33:23,461
- It depends. - Rock-paper-scissors.

1019
00:33:23,462 --> 00:33:24,592
Or should we vote?

1020
00:33:24,593 --> 00:33:25,661
Okay, let's vote.

1021
00:33:25,662 --> 00:33:27,392
Let's do the whispering votes.

1022
00:33:27,393 --> 00:33:28,961
Is there a fixed question,

1023
00:33:28,962 --> 00:33:30,870
- or does it depend on the member? - It depends.

1024
00:33:31,162 --> 00:33:34,906
(Who will be chosen as the collateral member?)

1025
00:33:35,643 --> 00:33:37,743
(Whispering)

1026
00:33:37,972 --> 00:33:39,166
He said,

1027
00:33:39,272 --> 00:33:40,945
(He's flustered.)

1028
00:33:41,012 --> 00:33:42,011
"You do it, punk."

1029
00:33:42,012 --> 00:33:44,052
(He whispered, "You do it, punk.")

1030
00:33:44,583 --> 00:33:46,382
(He voted with a little push.)

1031
00:33:46,383 --> 00:33:47,911
Why did you tell them?

1032
00:33:47,912 --> 00:33:49,251
Why did you have to swear?

1033
00:33:49,252 --> 00:33:50,481
Why did you swear at me?

1034
00:33:50,482 --> 00:33:51,822
No one else could hear it.

1035
00:33:51,823 --> 00:33:53,690
3 members have 3, 3, and 1 votes each.

1036
00:33:53,752 --> 00:33:55,761
- What? - It's a tie?

1037
00:33:55,762 --> 00:33:57,120
Seok Jin has three votes,

1038
00:33:57,162 --> 00:33:58,661
I have three votes,

1039
00:33:58,662 --> 00:33:59,988
Jong Kook has one vote.

1040
00:34:00,162 --> 00:34:01,292
Someone picked Jong Kook?

1041
00:34:01,293 --> 00:34:02,761
Right, I didn't vote yet.

1042
00:34:02,962 --> 00:34:03,961
Yes.

1043
00:34:03,962 --> 00:34:05,062
I vote for Seok Jin.

1044
00:34:05,063 --> 00:34:07,041
(He did not think for a moment.)

1045
00:34:07,472 --> 00:34:08,501
(He shouldn't have sworn at Jae Seok earlier.)

1046
00:34:08,502 --> 00:34:10,032
Seok Jin will be...

1047
00:34:10,542 --> 00:34:12,472
- the collateral member. - Okay.

1048
00:34:12,473 --> 00:34:13,711
(Seok Jin has been decided as the collateral member.)

1049
00:34:13,712 --> 00:34:17,311
- Seok Jin's collateral is... - I wonder what it is.

1050
00:34:17,312 --> 00:34:18,567
(What will be his collateral?)

1051
00:34:19,082 --> 00:34:22,388
(Cheol Min has already warned them about the collateral.)

1052
00:34:22,852 --> 00:34:24,552
(Since they can put up collateral instead of doing a mission,)

1053
00:34:24,553 --> 00:34:27,857
(it will be far more difficult than what they can imagine.)

1054
00:34:28,653 --> 00:34:30,921
(It will be out of all knowledge.)

1055
00:34:30,922 --> 00:34:35,362
(What would be Seok Jin's collateral?)

1056
00:34:35,363 --> 00:34:37,504
He needs to call his wife right now,

1057
00:34:37,602 --> 00:34:39,612
and tell her the password to his secret account,

1058
00:34:39,633 --> 00:34:42,541
expenditures from that account, and one lie he told her.

1059
00:34:42,542 --> 00:34:43,594
(He has to confess to his wife.)

1060
00:34:44,403 --> 00:34:46,671
(The collateral is out of all knowledge.)

1061
00:34:46,672 --> 00:34:47,866
This is it.

1062
00:34:47,973 --> 00:34:49,041
(How would I do that?)

1063
00:34:49,042 --> 00:34:51,357
- That's too harsh. - That was it?

1064
00:34:51,982 --> 00:34:53,136
How is this...

1065
00:34:53,752 --> 00:34:55,652
- That's tough. - It is.

1066
00:34:55,653 --> 00:34:57,981
When I count to three, you can make your decision.

1067
00:34:57,982 --> 00:34:59,391
My secret bank account and what?

1068
00:34:59,392 --> 00:35:00,652
The expenditures from that account,

1069
00:35:00,653 --> 00:35:02,592
and one big lie you told her.

1070
00:35:02,593 --> 00:35:03,746
One big lie?

1071
00:35:03,892 --> 00:35:05,092
I never lied to her.

1072
00:35:05,093 --> 00:35:06,191
Seok Jin, you can't tell her that.

1073
00:35:06,192 --> 00:35:08,609
(You can't tell her that.)

1074
00:35:08,692 --> 00:35:09,886
Not that one.

1075
00:35:09,903 --> 00:35:11,188
Not the one we know.

1076
00:35:11,633 --> 00:35:13,632
- You can't say that on TV. - Seok Jin,

1077
00:35:13,633 --> 00:35:14,795
think about it.

1078
00:35:15,672 --> 00:35:17,472
- Take your time. - Even if you give up...

1079
00:35:17,473 --> 00:35:19,512
Stand by the bus stop and think about it.

1080
00:35:19,513 --> 00:35:21,104
Even if you give up,

1081
00:35:21,142 --> 00:35:22,782
we'll respect your decision.

1082
00:35:22,783 --> 00:35:25,481
- Seok Jin, take your time. - We'll understand.

1083
00:35:25,482 --> 00:35:26,737
That's really tough.

1084
00:35:26,783 --> 00:35:28,516
It really depends on the person.

1085
00:35:28,683 --> 00:35:29,921
(Will he cover everything and give up their mission?)

1086
00:35:29,922 --> 00:35:31,789
He seems more discreet than ever.

1087
00:35:32,493 --> 00:35:33,552
- He's serious. - Yes.

1088
00:35:33,553 --> 00:35:35,552
He's just enjoying the attention he's getting.

1089
00:35:35,553 --> 00:35:39,030
(He's enjoying all the cameras filming him.)

1090
00:35:39,593 --> 00:35:40,961
(Why did you have to say that?)

1091
00:35:40,962 --> 00:35:42,561
Come on!

1092
00:35:42,562 --> 00:35:44,032
- Seriously? - Why did you...

1093
00:35:44,033 --> 00:35:45,902
Look at him! He's enjoying it.

1094
00:35:45,903 --> 00:35:47,771
He's even posing from different angles.

1095
00:35:47,772 --> 00:35:50,322
Look, he's even changing his hand gestures.

1096
00:35:51,002 --> 00:35:52,807
Seok Jin, time is passing by.

1097
00:35:52,913 --> 00:35:54,238
- Hurry up! - Hurry up!

1098
00:35:54,343 --> 00:35:56,117
Secret bank account and a lie?

1099
00:35:56,413 --> 00:35:59,581
That's fine, the secret account is fine.

1100
00:35:59,582 --> 00:36:00,807
But are you going to tell her the lie?

1101
00:36:01,482 --> 00:36:02,722
What?

1102
00:36:02,723 --> 00:36:04,481
- You're making me look suspicious. - Don't make it bigger than it is.

1103
00:36:04,482 --> 00:36:06,222
I didn't told her any lies...

1104
00:36:06,223 --> 00:36:08,538
- He's good at fabricating things. - Come on.

1105
00:36:08,723 --> 00:36:10,391
Let's go, Seok Jin!

1106
00:36:10,392 --> 00:36:12,021
- Cheer up! - You can do this.

1107
00:36:12,022 --> 00:36:13,725
- You got this. - One...

1108
00:36:14,062 --> 00:36:15,317
I made my decision.

1109
00:36:15,703 --> 00:36:17,902
- Is it "O" or "X"? - Make an "O" above your head,

1110
00:36:17,903 --> 00:36:19,809
- or an "X" on your chest. - Okay.

1111
00:36:19,933 --> 00:36:21,001
One,

1112
00:36:21,002 --> 00:36:23,641
(What will he do?)

1113
00:36:23,642 --> 00:36:24,693
Three.

1114
00:36:26,913 --> 00:36:28,137
I understand.

1115
00:36:28,372 --> 00:36:31,066
(He refuses to put up collateral.)

1116
00:36:31,843 --> 00:36:33,682
(Now they get their first fail sticker.)

1117
00:36:33,683 --> 00:36:35,782
With three of these, the game is over.

1118
00:36:35,783 --> 00:36:36,921
Here's your first sticker.

1119
00:36:36,922 --> 00:36:39,339
- It's our first. - He does have a secret.

1120
00:36:39,453 --> 00:36:40,521
- He's hiding something. - So that lie...

1121
00:36:40,522 --> 00:36:42,021
was actually true?

1122
00:36:42,022 --> 00:36:43,222
(She's trying to tease him.)

1123
00:36:43,223 --> 00:36:44,222
That was true?

1124
00:36:44,223 --> 00:36:46,391
When he made the "X", we were all whispering.

1125
00:36:46,392 --> 00:36:47,556
What did he lie about?

1126
00:36:47,593 --> 00:36:49,262
- This is... - Seok Jin,

1127
00:36:49,263 --> 00:36:50,863
it's also weird to say no to this.

1128
00:36:50,903 --> 00:36:52,061
it's also weird to say no to this.

1129
00:36:52,062 --> 00:36:53,871
I'll call her.

1130
00:36:53,872 --> 00:36:55,331
- No. - I have to do this.

1131
00:36:55,332 --> 00:36:57,072
Now I see what was weird about it.

1132
00:36:57,073 --> 00:36:58,902
- What would she feel like? - I see.

1133
00:36:58,903 --> 00:37:00,972
- Right? - He does have a secret account!

1134
00:37:00,973 --> 00:37:02,711
It's wrong enough to have a secret bank account,

1135
00:37:02,712 --> 00:37:04,039
and you basically told her you won't tell the password.

1136
00:37:04,642 --> 00:37:06,412
And you won't tell her a big lie you told her.

1137
00:37:06,413 --> 00:37:07,811
- When your wife sees this, - Come to think of it,

1138
00:37:07,812 --> 00:37:10,182
- what would she think? - I'd look suspicious.

1139
00:37:10,183 --> 00:37:11,682
I don't have all that, honey!

1140
00:37:11,982 --> 00:37:13,222
I really don't.

1141
00:37:13,223 --> 00:37:15,395
You can keep your secrets.

1142
00:37:15,863 --> 00:37:17,657
No, I don't have any secrets!

1143
00:37:17,892 --> 00:37:19,492
They're all whispering.

1144
00:37:19,493 --> 00:37:20,583
I don't have any!

1145
00:37:21,232 --> 00:37:23,242
Honey, I'm as clear as crystal.

1146
00:37:23,363 --> 00:37:24,556
You know me!

1147
00:37:25,433 --> 00:37:26,494
All right?

1148
00:37:26,602 --> 00:37:28,271
Let's get on the bus to get to the next mission.

1149
00:37:28,272 --> 00:37:30,271
- Why did you do that? - It became all weird now.

1150
00:37:30,272 --> 00:37:31,936
Look at what you've done.

1151
00:37:32,102 --> 00:37:34,271
Seok Jin is finished for the day.

1152
00:37:34,272 --> 00:37:35,412
(They depart from their first stop.)

1153
00:37:35,413 --> 00:37:36,682
What kind of mission was that?

1154
00:37:36,683 --> 00:37:37,907
I have nothing to hide.

1155
00:37:38,142 --> 00:37:39,782
We should be careful with collateral.

1156
00:37:39,783 --> 00:37:41,012
- It's not as easy as we thought. - Yes.

1157
00:37:41,013 --> 00:37:42,112
If I told her...

1158
00:37:42,113 --> 00:37:46,021
just random numbers and password, how would you guys check it?

1159
00:37:46,022 --> 00:37:47,521
- You should have done that. - You should have done that.

1160
00:37:47,522 --> 00:37:49,225
Right, and call her afterwards,

1161
00:37:49,823 --> 00:37:51,822
and tell her it was just for the show.

1162
00:37:51,823 --> 00:37:53,592
That's what you should've done.

1163
00:37:53,593 --> 00:37:55,691
You all know how honest I can be.

1164
00:37:55,692 --> 00:37:57,875
(You all know how honest I can be.)

1165
00:37:58,462 --> 00:37:59,472
- Honest? - Are you serious?

1166
00:37:59,473 --> 00:38:01,238
Then why did you made the "X"?

1167
00:38:01,533 --> 00:38:03,001
You could have been honest and told her.

1168
00:38:03,002 --> 00:38:04,807
I said Cheol Min would make our missions harder.

1169
00:38:05,002 --> 00:38:06,641
Let's just move on.

1170
00:38:06,642 --> 00:38:07,941
- Yes. - Is it that simple and funny?

1171
00:38:07,942 --> 00:38:09,012
- Let's go. - Let's move on.

1172
00:38:09,013 --> 00:38:10,382
Let's move on. It's all done with.

1173
00:38:10,383 --> 00:38:12,342
Right. That's enough.

1174
00:38:12,343 --> 00:38:13,475
It was for the show.

1175
00:38:14,013 --> 00:38:15,182
I made the "X" for our show.

1176
00:38:15,183 --> 00:38:16,621
- Of course you did. - You were being funny.

1177
00:38:16,622 --> 00:38:18,765
- It wouldn't have been funny. - We're here.

1178
00:38:19,522 --> 00:38:21,291
(No one can hear him now.)

1179
00:38:21,292 --> 00:38:22,792
- it wouldn't have been funny. - We're here.

1180
00:38:22,823 --> 00:38:24,162
if I had told random stuff.

1181
00:38:24,163 --> 00:38:26,492
(Who am I talking to?)

1182
00:38:26,493 --> 00:38:28,691
What's the name? It says "Jeonju Table".

1183
00:38:28,692 --> 00:38:30,362
- A table? - There's food.

1184
00:38:30,363 --> 00:38:31,461
- It's food. - Everyone!

1185
00:38:31,462 --> 00:38:32,532
We have to do this.

1186
00:38:32,533 --> 00:38:33,802
Everyone, as we've said,

1187
00:38:33,803 --> 00:38:35,632
it could be a mission for lunch, or a dud.

1188
00:38:35,633 --> 00:38:38,001
If it's a dud, you get a fail sticker immediately.

1189
00:38:38,002 --> 00:38:39,072
Skip this.

1190
00:38:39,073 --> 00:38:42,682
There's nothing here, but a piece of paper on the table.

1191
00:38:42,683 --> 00:38:43,981
I think the name was a trick.

1192
00:38:43,982 --> 00:38:45,081
- Let's pass. - Now,

1193
00:38:45,082 --> 00:38:46,282
here's the official question.

1194
00:38:46,283 --> 00:38:50,722
Second stop, "Jeonju Table", will you get off, or pass?

1195
00:38:50,723 --> 00:38:52,322
- Pass! - Pass!

1196
00:38:52,323 --> 00:38:53,351
Okay, pass.

1197
00:38:53,352 --> 00:38:55,597
There's nothing but a table with a piece of paper.

1198
00:38:55,622 --> 00:38:57,222
- We'll pass by. - Dud?

1199
00:38:57,223 --> 00:38:58,896
(Was the 2nd stop a mission or a dud stop?)

1200
00:39:00,832 --> 00:39:02,262
(They move on to the 3rd stop.)

1201
00:39:02,263 --> 00:39:04,632
- We see things right through. - We're experts.

1202
00:39:04,633 --> 00:39:06,831
- We have to win this time. - Right.

1203
00:39:06,832 --> 00:39:08,501
Because if we fail again...

1204
00:39:08,502 --> 00:39:09,899
I can't do that dance!

1205
00:39:10,303 --> 00:39:12,138
You all heard about collateral.

1206
00:39:12,272 --> 00:39:14,371
- Right? - Right, it was tough.

1207
00:39:14,372 --> 00:39:15,612
It was really shocking.

1208
00:39:15,613 --> 00:39:16,782
It says, "Unified Lunch".

1209
00:39:16,783 --> 00:39:18,481
- Another lunch? - It's Unified Lunch.

1210
00:39:18,482 --> 00:39:19,981
- They're all about food. - Two times in a row.

1211
00:39:19,982 --> 00:39:21,081
I think I got it.

1212
00:39:21,082 --> 00:39:22,756
It says, "Unified", so we're choosing the same menu.

1213
00:39:22,883 --> 00:39:24,851
- Let's go! - Let's go!

1214
00:39:24,852 --> 00:39:26,722
- We can do this! - I think he's right.

1215
00:39:26,723 --> 00:39:29,561
Third stop, "Unified Lunch",

1216
00:39:29,562 --> 00:39:30,992
will you get off, or pass?

1217
00:39:30,993 --> 00:39:32,726
- We'll get off! - We'll get off!

1218
00:39:32,863 --> 00:39:34,259
- Are you sure? - Yes!

1219
00:39:34,433 --> 00:39:36,402
I think Haha has a point.

1220
00:39:36,403 --> 00:39:38,202
- We're choosing the same menu. - Right.

1221
00:39:38,203 --> 00:39:40,345
- Like jjajangmyeon. - Just like last time.

1222
00:39:40,403 --> 00:39:41,472
Let's go!

1223
00:39:41,473 --> 00:39:43,105
Could it be a dud stop?

1224
00:39:43,142 --> 00:39:44,802
You guys must be hungry.

1225
00:39:44,803 --> 00:39:45,802
- Yes. - Yes.

1226
00:39:45,803 --> 00:39:47,445
- Do you want lunch? - Yes.

1227
00:39:47,613 --> 00:39:50,539
At the stop you have chosen, "Unified Lunch",

1228
00:39:50,613 --> 00:39:52,173
you will be...

1229
00:39:52,243 --> 00:39:55,012
memorizing all 31 words that gets harder by each,

1230
00:39:55,013 --> 00:39:58,282
and each person has to say at least one word.

1231
00:39:58,283 --> 00:39:59,547
It's Loyalty 31.

1232
00:39:59,993 --> 00:40:02,452
- Did he say "memorize"? - Memorize 31 words?

1233
00:40:02,453 --> 00:40:03,461
This is bad.

1234
00:40:03,462 --> 00:40:07,032
Memorize 31 words that the staff gives you within 2 minutes,

1235
00:40:07,033 --> 00:40:10,101
and you win if you say all 31 words after that.

1236
00:40:10,102 --> 00:40:11,591
There are no limits...

1237
00:40:11,803 --> 00:40:14,202
to the number of words a person can say.

1238
00:40:14,203 --> 00:40:16,671
You can raise your right hand, and say 8, 9 words at once.

1239
00:40:16,672 --> 00:40:18,242
- We can divide. - No overlapping words?

1240
00:40:18,243 --> 00:40:20,612
But if you get one word wrong,

1241
00:40:20,613 --> 00:40:22,541
- you fail. - Come on.

1242
00:40:22,542 --> 00:40:25,877
All members must at least say one word each.

1243
00:40:26,613 --> 00:40:28,811
We're eight people, we can divide the words.

1244
00:40:28,812 --> 00:40:30,148
You have two minutes.

1245
00:40:30,183 --> 00:40:31,282
- Yes. - We're going to count down.

1246
00:40:31,283 --> 00:40:33,552
We can just memorize four words each.

1247
00:40:33,553 --> 00:40:37,362
- Right, and from you... - It's 4 words for 1 person.

1248
00:40:37,363 --> 00:40:38,413
Here are the words.

1249
00:40:38,593 --> 00:40:40,231
We're counting down. Get ready, go!

1250
00:40:40,232 --> 00:40:41,231
- Let's go. - What is it?

1251
00:40:41,232 --> 00:40:42,834
- Get ready, go! - What is it?

1252
00:40:43,203 --> 00:40:44,461
You memorize 1 to 4.

1253
00:40:44,462 --> 00:40:45,932
(They're going to memorize by the order of their seats.)

1254
00:40:45,933 --> 00:40:47,101
- 5 to 8 for me? - 5 to 8.

1255
00:40:47,102 --> 00:40:48,432
I'm memorizing from 29 to 31.

1256
00:40:48,433 --> 00:40:50,514
- I'm 21 to 24. - I'm 25 to 28.

1257
00:40:50,602 --> 00:40:51,601
What is this?

1258
00:40:51,602 --> 00:40:52,622
(What is this?)

1259
00:40:53,113 --> 00:40:54,171
They're the name of the colors.

1260
00:40:54,172 --> 00:40:55,366
(It's worrisome.)

1261
00:40:56,142 --> 00:40:57,441
What am I going to do?

1262
00:40:57,442 --> 00:40:58,534
(Full of difficult words)

1263
00:40:58,942 --> 00:41:00,112
- This is difficult. - You're 1 to 4, right?

1264
00:41:00,113 --> 00:41:01,552
- Yes. - Spring green.

1265
00:41:01,553 --> 00:41:02,848
- Goldenrod. - It's difficult.

1266
00:41:03,352 --> 00:41:05,621
(They're difficult, but 4 words in 2 minutes should be doable.)

1267
00:41:05,622 --> 00:41:07,662
Dark khaki, floral white.

1268
00:41:07,892 --> 00:41:09,279
Floral... This isn't easy.

1269
00:41:09,422 --> 00:41:10,621
Ocean, navy.

1270
00:41:10,622 --> 00:41:12,704
(They're using different methods of memorizing.)

1271
00:41:13,493 --> 00:41:15,879
(You have to make a song when you're memorizing.)

1272
00:41:16,303 --> 00:41:18,036
You have one minute remaining.

1273
00:41:18,502 --> 00:41:20,747
I'll say the words out loud for everyone.

1274
00:41:21,332 --> 00:41:22,601
(Cheol Min is trying to disturb.)

1275
00:41:22,602 --> 00:41:24,342
Stop! You're confusing me!

1276
00:41:24,343 --> 00:41:25,371
Slate gray.

1277
00:41:25,372 --> 00:41:26,912
- Be quiet! - Peach puff.

1278
00:41:26,913 --> 00:41:27,941
- Come on! - Stop that.

1279
00:41:27,942 --> 00:41:29,342
- Stop that. - You're confusing me.

1280
00:41:29,343 --> 00:41:30,641
(It's already confusing as it is.)

1281
00:41:30,642 --> 00:41:32,512
Saddle brown.

1282
00:41:32,513 --> 00:41:33,912
Orange red.

1283
00:41:33,913 --> 00:41:36,282
- Hollywood, burlywood. - All right.

1284
00:41:36,283 --> 00:41:37,476
Please remove the board.

1285
00:41:38,082 --> 00:41:39,246
Take them away!

1286
00:41:39,892 --> 00:41:40,952
I'd like to start.

1287
00:41:40,953 --> 00:41:42,791
Anyone who holds their right hand may begin.

1288
00:41:42,792 --> 00:41:43,884
You may begin, So Min.

1289
00:41:44,192 --> 00:41:46,609
Dark khaki, floral white,

1290
00:41:46,763 --> 00:41:49,383
and blue violet and burlywood.

1291
00:41:49,703 --> 00:41:51,497
- I have my hand up. - Me!

1292
00:41:51,703 --> 00:41:52,895
- What a relief. - One moment, please.

1293
00:41:53,172 --> 00:41:55,009
- Could you repeat that, So Min? - Sure.

1294
00:41:55,272 --> 00:41:58,141
Can't you just replay the audio recording?

1295
00:41:58,142 --> 00:41:59,672
(Just replay the audio recording!)

1296
00:41:59,872 --> 00:42:01,242
(She gets cranky at the request.)

1297
00:42:01,243 --> 00:42:03,353
We're all very sensitive at the moment.

1298
00:42:03,743 --> 00:42:05,141
- We are. - We're very sensitive.

1299
00:42:05,142 --> 00:42:06,512
Number 21, dark khaki.

1300
00:42:06,513 --> 00:42:07,882
Number 22, floral white.

1301
00:42:07,883 --> 00:42:10,322
Number 23, blue violet. Number 24...

1302
00:42:10,323 --> 00:42:11,914
Could you repeat number 22?

1303
00:42:12,283 --> 00:42:13,781
I'm asking you to repeat because of number 22.

1304
00:42:14,323 --> 00:42:15,492
Floral white.

1305
00:42:15,493 --> 00:42:16,862
- Again. - Come on...

1306
00:42:16,863 --> 00:42:17,961
- Come back in. - Don't do it.

1307
00:42:17,962 --> 00:42:19,262
Try again later. She'll try again later.

1308
00:42:19,263 --> 00:42:20,823
- I can say mine clearly. - Go head.

1309
00:42:21,232 --> 00:42:22,932
All right. Spring green.

1310
00:42:22,933 --> 00:42:24,061
Spring green. Next?

1311
00:42:24,062 --> 00:42:25,302
Goldenrod.

1312
00:42:25,303 --> 00:42:26,671
- Goldenrod? - Yes.

1313
00:42:26,672 --> 00:42:29,072
(He easily gets two of them correct.)

1314
00:42:29,073 --> 00:42:30,202
Olive drab.

1315
00:42:30,203 --> 00:42:31,342
(Number 11, olive drab.)

1316
00:42:31,343 --> 00:42:32,496
Olive drag.

1317
00:42:32,772 --> 00:42:34,041
Please say it clearly.

1318
00:42:34,042 --> 00:42:35,871
Take some time off, Jae Seok.

1319
00:42:35,872 --> 00:42:37,811
- I'll go next! - Olive...

1320
00:42:37,812 --> 00:42:38,965
Olive drab.

1321
00:42:39,343 --> 00:42:40,811
- Olive? - Yes. Olive drab.

1322
00:42:40,812 --> 00:42:42,211
- Drab. - What's the last letter?

1323
00:42:42,212 --> 00:42:43,452
- B. - B?

1324
00:42:43,453 --> 00:42:44,682
- Wait a minute! - Don't!

1325
00:42:44,683 --> 00:42:45,773
(Wait!)

1326
00:42:46,093 --> 00:42:47,222
(He gets confused as the producer teases him.)

1327
00:42:47,223 --> 00:42:48,751
- He'll do it over! - All right, all right!

1328
00:42:48,752 --> 00:42:50,291
- Time! - I'll go first.

1329
00:42:50,292 --> 00:42:51,362
- Try again later. - I'll go next.

1330
00:42:51,363 --> 00:42:52,647
- I'll do it later. - I don't think it's right.

1331
00:42:52,692 --> 00:42:54,121
- Are you sure it's the answer? - I'll go next.

1332
00:42:54,832 --> 00:42:56,535
Dark magenta.

1333
00:42:56,703 --> 00:42:58,762
- Deep pink. - Deep pink.

1334
00:42:58,763 --> 00:43:00,844
- Slate grey. - Slate grey.

1335
00:43:01,573 --> 00:43:03,441
- Crimson. - Crimson.

1336
00:43:03,442 --> 00:43:04,472
I'll go next!

1337
00:43:04,473 --> 00:43:05,572
I think I might forget them.

1338
00:43:05,573 --> 00:43:07,242
- I really want to go now. - This is my limit.

1339
00:43:07,243 --> 00:43:08,572
- Se Chan. - I can't hold on any longer!

1340
00:43:08,573 --> 00:43:09,842
- He had his hand up first. - I'm going to...

1341
00:43:09,843 --> 00:43:11,081
I'm going to relieve myself!

1342
00:43:11,082 --> 00:43:12,441
(He starts threatening.)

1343
00:43:12,442 --> 00:43:14,044
- I'm serious. - I'm going to forget them!

1344
00:43:14,183 --> 00:43:16,052
Pink, moccasin,

1345
00:43:16,053 --> 00:43:17,378
chartreuse,

1346
00:43:17,653 --> 00:43:20,121
and medium sea green.

1347
00:43:20,122 --> 00:43:21,722
- Okay. - Me. I'll go next.

1348
00:43:21,723 --> 00:43:22,987
- Seok Jin. - Me, too.

1349
00:43:23,192 --> 00:43:24,191
- I really need to go. - It's Seok Jin's turn.

1350
00:43:24,192 --> 00:43:25,244
Please...

1351
00:43:25,292 --> 00:43:26,331
Please!

1352
00:43:26,332 --> 00:43:27,384
Teal.

1353
00:43:28,292 --> 00:43:29,632
Sky blue.

1354
00:43:29,633 --> 00:43:32,162
(Teal, sky blue)

1355
00:43:32,163 --> 00:43:33,601
- What is he doing? - Come back in, Seok Jin.

1356
00:43:33,602 --> 00:43:34,702
Think about it again.

1357
00:43:34,703 --> 00:43:36,743
- Navy! Navy. - Navy.

1358
00:43:37,073 --> 00:43:38,368
Light blue.

1359
00:43:39,142 --> 00:43:40,295
Light blue.

1360
00:43:40,473 --> 00:43:42,003
There we go. I did it.

1361
00:43:42,613 --> 00:43:43,882
- Khaki. - Okay.

1362
00:43:43,883 --> 00:43:45,041
(Haha begins confidently.)

1363
00:43:45,042 --> 00:43:46,182
I need a minute.

1364
00:43:46,183 --> 00:43:48,552
(I need a minute.)

1365
00:43:48,553 --> 00:43:50,182
- You only have three! - What's wrong with you?

1366
00:43:50,183 --> 00:43:51,351
You can't even memorize three?

1367
00:43:51,352 --> 00:43:53,495
Please raise your right hand. Only those who do can go.

1368
00:43:53,553 --> 00:43:55,452
- Peach puff. - Peach puff.

1369
00:43:55,453 --> 00:43:57,492
- Make sure to get it right. - You have a good memory.

1370
00:43:57,493 --> 00:43:58,615
Come on.

1371
00:43:59,223 --> 00:44:00,386
And wait a minute.

1372
00:44:00,433 --> 00:44:01,891
You can't even memorize that?

1373
00:44:01,892 --> 00:44:03,566
Mine was really weird.

1374
00:44:03,703 --> 00:44:05,932
How do you even memorize your scripts?

1375
00:44:05,933 --> 00:44:07,871
I even managed and you're having a hard time?

1376
00:44:07,872 --> 00:44:10,250
You need to put it in a song to make it easy.

1377
00:44:10,372 --> 00:44:12,412
Cornflower blue.

1378
00:44:13,973 --> 00:44:16,972
Medium slate blue.

1379
00:44:16,982 --> 00:44:18,141
Okay!

1380
00:44:18,142 --> 00:44:19,204
(Haha gets his three words correct.)

1381
00:44:19,582 --> 00:44:22,030
(Kwang Soo, So Min, Jae Seok, and Ji Hyo are the only ones left.)

1382
00:44:22,613 --> 00:44:24,082
Saddle brown.

1383
00:44:24,723 --> 00:44:26,150
Orange red.

1384
00:44:27,553 --> 00:44:28,822
Chocolate.

1385
00:44:28,823 --> 00:44:30,121
Dodger blue.

1386
00:44:30,122 --> 00:44:32,335
(She says them carefully and gets it correct.)

1387
00:44:32,363 --> 00:44:33,391
Kwang Soo.

1388
00:44:33,392 --> 00:44:34,585
Medium...

1389
00:44:35,163 --> 00:44:36,432
Medium... The quoise?

1390
00:44:36,433 --> 00:44:37,932
- What? The quiett? - Medium...

1391
00:44:37,933 --> 00:44:39,635
Are you talking about the singer, The Quiett?

1392
00:44:39,772 --> 00:44:41,271
Wait a minute!

1393
00:44:41,272 --> 00:44:42,802
- Why are you mentioning The Quiett? - I'll go again later.

1394
00:44:42,803 --> 00:44:43,802
I'll go again later.

1395
00:44:43,803 --> 00:44:45,271
Someone else is bound to get it wrong before me.

1396
00:44:45,272 --> 00:44:46,292
I'll go again later.

1397
00:44:46,872 --> 00:44:48,271
I didn't get it wrong.

1398
00:44:48,272 --> 00:44:49,342
(He's trying to avoid criticism against him.)

1399
00:44:49,343 --> 00:44:51,627
- So Min, you have to go next. - No, I'm...

1400
00:44:51,683 --> 00:44:53,112
- You have to go next. - Jae Seok.

1401
00:44:53,113 --> 00:44:55,152
- Jae Seok will go first. - So Min.

1402
00:44:55,153 --> 00:44:56,452
- Next! - You can go first.

1403
00:44:56,453 --> 00:44:57,503
Jae Seok.

1404
00:44:57,752 --> 00:44:59,481
I'll begin with the next one.

1405
00:44:59,482 --> 00:45:00,751
(I'll begin with the next one instead.)

1406
00:45:00,752 --> 00:45:01,915
Fire brick.

1407
00:45:02,553 --> 00:45:03,722
- Fire brick. - Okay.

1408
00:45:03,723 --> 00:45:05,497
- I have one more left, right? - Yes.

1409
00:45:05,562 --> 00:45:06,731
I'll get back to that.

1410
00:45:06,732 --> 00:45:07,992
Get it over with!

1411
00:45:07,993 --> 00:45:09,032
I'll get back to that.

1412
00:45:09,033 --> 00:45:10,461
(He asks for a break after getting one correct.)

1413
00:45:10,462 --> 00:45:11,656
Come on!

1414
00:45:11,763 --> 00:45:12,926
- Hurry up. - Just do it.

1415
00:45:13,033 --> 00:45:14,302
- Hurry up and say it. - I know what it is.

1416
00:45:14,303 --> 00:45:16,036
Then hurry up and get it over with.

1417
00:45:16,602 --> 00:45:17,871
Olive...

1418
00:45:17,872 --> 00:45:20,371
(Olive...)

1419
00:45:20,372 --> 00:45:21,463
- Drab. - Drag?

1420
00:45:21,542 --> 00:45:23,711
- It's "drag". - Olive drab? Correct.

1421
00:45:23,712 --> 00:45:25,141
What? It's correct?

1422
00:45:25,142 --> 00:45:27,182
- You're the only one left, So Min. - You go first, Kwang Soo.

1423
00:45:27,183 --> 00:45:28,552
- Kwang Soo! - You go first.

1424
00:45:28,553 --> 00:45:29,952
I don't think it's "the quiett", Kwang Soo.

1425
00:45:29,953 --> 00:45:31,021
You go first. Please.

1426
00:45:31,022 --> 00:45:32,052
We're going to be collateral if we fail this time.

1427
00:45:32,053 --> 00:45:33,592
Let's hurry up and get it over with.

1428
00:45:33,593 --> 00:45:35,092
- It's nothing. - Go on, So Min.

1429
00:45:35,093 --> 00:45:36,121
- You can go first. - Go on.

1430
00:45:36,122 --> 00:45:38,306
- Let's play rock-paper-scissors. - Rock-paper-scissors!

1431
00:45:38,593 --> 00:45:39,891
(So Min wins.)

1432
00:45:39,892 --> 00:45:40,912
You go first.

1433
00:45:41,692 --> 00:45:42,961
- Start! - Medium...

1434
00:45:42,962 --> 00:45:44,532
(Medium...)

1435
00:45:44,533 --> 00:45:45,726
the quoise.

1436
00:45:46,163 --> 00:45:47,192
What are you saying?

1437
00:45:47,403 --> 00:45:48,601
(Medium the quoise.)

1438
00:45:48,602 --> 00:45:49,902
- That's not it. - What are you doing?

1439
00:45:49,903 --> 00:45:51,072
- That's not allowed. - What was that?

1440
00:45:51,073 --> 00:45:52,541
I think it's "medium the quoise"...

1441
00:45:52,542 --> 00:45:54,472
- Kwang Soo, please... - It's either "de" or "the".

1442
00:45:54,473 --> 00:45:55,541
I don't think it's "the".

1443
00:45:55,542 --> 00:45:57,811
- I think it's "de". - Maybe it's not "medium the",

1444
00:45:57,812 --> 00:45:59,311
- but "medium"... - It's "de".

1445
00:45:59,312 --> 00:46:00,452
- It's either "the" or "de". - It's "de".

1446
00:46:00,453 --> 00:46:02,251
"De" is more of a Europian language.

1447
00:46:02,252 --> 00:46:03,481
It's Europian. D, E.

1448
00:46:03,482 --> 00:46:04,982
"The" is English.

1449
00:46:05,183 --> 00:46:06,421
- Then, "de"? - By the way...

1450
00:46:06,422 --> 00:46:08,251
Kwang Soo, color names come from Europe.

1451
00:46:08,252 --> 00:46:11,021
You wouldn't be having a hard time if it was "the quoise".

1452
00:46:11,022 --> 00:46:12,092
- He has a point. - You would have gotten it right.

1453
00:46:12,093 --> 00:46:13,762
I remember it being hard. It must be "de".

1454
00:46:13,763 --> 00:46:14,891
- It's "de". - Go with "de".

1455
00:46:14,892 --> 00:46:16,702
- Medium de quoise. - Medium de quoise.

1456
00:46:16,703 --> 00:46:18,662
(His final choice is medium de quoise.)

1457
00:46:18,663 --> 00:46:20,773
(Incorrect.)

1458
00:46:22,002 --> 00:46:23,601
- What's the answer? - Medium turquoise.

1459
00:46:23,602 --> 00:46:25,171
- Kwang Soo... - Turquoise.

1460
00:46:25,172 --> 00:46:26,371
- It's "Tur"? - He got it wrong!

1461
00:46:26,372 --> 00:46:27,739
It's not even close.

1462
00:46:28,542 --> 00:46:29,706
You fool!

1463
00:46:29,843 --> 00:46:31,112
- His head is full of nothing. - Hey!

1464
00:46:31,113 --> 00:46:32,336
- Hey fool! - I'm sorry.

1465
00:46:32,383 --> 00:46:34,282
- I admit it, I'm sorry. - Wait a minute.

1466
00:46:34,283 --> 00:46:35,476
- Hold on. - I'm really sorry.

1467
00:46:35,812 --> 00:46:37,152
- Hold on. Come over here, you two. - You two...

1468
00:46:37,153 --> 00:46:38,581
I already got hit.

1469
00:46:38,582 --> 00:46:39,952
- I... - The three of you...

1470
00:46:39,953 --> 00:46:41,052
Either one of you will have to be the collateral.

1471
00:46:41,053 --> 00:46:42,121
Let's do that.

1472
00:46:42,122 --> 00:46:44,322
If we have to put up collateral, it's going to be either one of you.

1473
00:46:44,323 --> 00:46:45,362
Let's do this one more time!

1474
00:46:45,363 --> 00:46:47,061
Are you ready?

1475
00:46:47,062 --> 00:46:48,731
- Yes. - We can do this.

1476
00:46:48,732 --> 00:46:50,569
- We have to get it right this time. - We will.

1477
00:46:51,562 --> 00:46:54,184
(The next category is animals.)

1478
00:46:54,303 --> 00:46:55,572
Porcupine.

1479
00:46:55,573 --> 00:46:56,601
I got it!

1480
00:46:56,602 --> 00:46:58,786
Marmoset...

1481
00:46:59,073 --> 00:47:00,141
monkey.

1482
00:47:00,142 --> 00:47:01,311
Shrew.

1483
00:47:01,312 --> 00:47:02,441
Walrus.

1484
00:47:02,442 --> 00:47:03,711
How many do we have left? Are we finished?

1485
00:47:03,712 --> 00:47:05,041
- Seok Jin needs to go. - I'll start!

1486
00:47:05,042 --> 00:47:06,981
Tasmanian devil.

1487
00:47:06,982 --> 00:47:08,981
- "Tas"? - Tasmanian devil.

1488
00:47:08,982 --> 00:47:10,521
- Correct. - Okay!

1489
00:47:10,522 --> 00:47:11,849
(He gets the difficult one correct.)

1490
00:47:12,422 --> 00:47:14,322
We have to get this right.

1491
00:47:14,323 --> 00:47:15,923
There's one more left.

1492
00:47:17,192 --> 00:47:19,029
Is it humpback whale or backhump whale?

1493
00:47:19,363 --> 00:47:20,961
Is it humpback whale or backhump whale?

1494
00:47:20,962 --> 00:47:22,461
- What? - Humpback.

1495
00:47:22,462 --> 00:47:24,461
- It's humpback, right? - I'm 100 percent sure.

1496
00:47:24,462 --> 00:47:25,662
- It's humpback. - It's humpback.

1497
00:47:25,663 --> 00:47:26,972
- It's humpback. - Are you sure?

1498
00:47:26,973 --> 00:47:28,257
It must have a hump on its back.

1499
00:47:28,403 --> 00:47:31,601
Why are you asking us? You should be the one to memorize!

1500
00:47:31,602 --> 00:47:34,091
(Come to think of it, you should be the one to memorize!)

1501
00:47:34,513 --> 00:47:35,541
(Whimpering)

1502
00:47:35,542 --> 00:47:36,811
Jong Kook's going to get so mad if you get it wrong this time.

1503
00:47:36,812 --> 00:47:38,481
- It's humpback. - Is it right?

1504
00:47:38,482 --> 00:47:39,541
- Yes, it's humpback. - Don't fall for it.

1505
00:47:39,542 --> 00:47:41,351
Will you give me another chance to call my wife...

1506
00:47:41,352 --> 00:47:42,912
if I say the wrong answer?

1507
00:47:42,913 --> 00:47:45,198
(He suddenly tries to bargain.)

1508
00:47:46,153 --> 00:47:48,233
- What is he saying? - He wants to call his wife.

1509
00:47:49,022 --> 00:47:50,291
What do you think you're doing?

1510
00:47:50,292 --> 00:47:51,762
We're not going to choose you, anyways.

1511
00:47:51,763 --> 00:47:53,670
Can you be chosen the collateral twice?

1512
00:47:54,133 --> 00:47:55,591
- You're already done. - Okay.

1513
00:47:56,093 --> 00:47:57,532
- It's humpback. - Humpback is correct.

1514
00:47:57,533 --> 00:47:58,802
- Humpback whale. - Good job.

1515
00:47:58,803 --> 00:48:00,128
- He got it. - It's correct.

1516
00:48:00,973 --> 00:48:02,132
It's correct.

1517
00:48:02,133 --> 00:48:03,529
- Okay! - Okay!

1518
00:48:04,973 --> 00:48:08,012
(They complete "Unified Lunch".)

1519
00:48:08,013 --> 00:48:09,441
It's our first win!

1520
00:48:09,613 --> 00:48:10,612
We got one.

1521
00:48:10,613 --> 00:48:11,842
We need two more wins.

1522
00:48:11,843 --> 00:48:12,882
(The members win if they pass two more rounds!)

1523
00:48:12,883 --> 00:48:14,211
- You guys won fair and square. - Yes.

1524
00:48:14,212 --> 00:48:16,452
We will move on to the next stop.

1525
00:48:16,453 --> 00:48:17,452
- Let's go! - Okay!

1526
00:48:17,453 --> 00:48:19,390
(They move on to the next round after winning on the 3rd stop.)

1527
00:48:20,053 --> 00:48:21,652
(They have 3 hours left and they decides to skip the 4th stop.)

1528
00:48:21,653 --> 00:48:23,291
It's a snack bar.

1529
00:48:23,292 --> 00:48:25,162
- The next stop it, "Snack Bar". - Let's get off.

1530
00:48:25,163 --> 00:48:26,632
- Okay. - We'll get off.

1531
00:48:26,633 --> 00:48:28,231
- We need to do this round. - Let's get off.

1532
00:48:28,232 --> 00:48:30,132
I have a good feeling about this stop.

1533
00:48:30,133 --> 00:48:31,632
Will you be getting off at "Snack Bar",

1534
00:48:31,633 --> 00:48:33,061
or skipping?

1535
00:48:33,062 --> 00:48:34,331
- We will get off! - We will get off!

1536
00:48:34,332 --> 00:48:35,671
- It's a dud? - What?

1537
00:48:35,672 --> 00:48:37,202
(They got off without hesitation, but...)

1538
00:48:37,203 --> 00:48:38,293
(You may be angry, but why don't you eat at home?)

1539
00:48:38,872 --> 00:48:39,912
- It's a dud? - What is this?

1540
00:48:39,913 --> 00:48:41,871
"You may be angry, but why don't you eat at home".

1541
00:48:41,872 --> 00:48:43,239
- Is it a dud? - It's a dud!

1542
00:48:43,582 --> 00:48:44,909
- It's a dud. - What?

1543
00:48:45,042 --> 00:48:46,112
- Don't lie. - Come on.

1544
00:48:46,113 --> 00:48:47,552
The other stop wasn't the dud?

1545
00:48:47,553 --> 00:48:48,837
There was a cooking mission on that stop.

1546
00:48:49,082 --> 00:48:50,382
I told you!

1547
00:48:50,383 --> 00:48:51,953
- This stop is a dud. - You have two fails so far.

1548
00:48:52,553 --> 00:48:54,322
Please get on the bus so that we can move on to the next stop.

1549
00:48:54,323 --> 00:48:55,992
If we fail once again, then it's over, right?

1550
00:48:55,993 --> 00:48:57,262
- It's our last chance. - It's the end for good.

1551
00:48:57,263 --> 00:48:59,506
We have to practice acrobatics.

1552
00:48:59,522 --> 00:49:00,891
- We have to... - Jae Seok.

1553
00:49:00,892 --> 00:49:02,492
- We have to do acrobatics. - We need to win no matter what.

1554
00:49:02,493 --> 00:49:04,132
- How will we win? - We need to win two rounds.

1555
00:49:04,133 --> 00:49:05,762
Warm up your backs, everyone.

1556
00:49:05,763 --> 00:49:07,432
We need to spin three times in midair.

1557
00:49:07,433 --> 00:49:08,432
You should be prepared.

1558
00:49:08,433 --> 00:49:09,625
- What do we do? - Jae Seok!

1559
00:49:09,703 --> 00:49:10,702
Let's just go.

1560
00:49:10,703 --> 00:49:12,101
They said there's only one dud stop.

1561
00:49:12,102 --> 00:49:13,612
- There will be no more dud stop. - That's right.

1562
00:49:13,613 --> 00:49:14,972
- That's it. - Okay.

1563
00:49:14,973 --> 00:49:17,182
- I thought the other one was it. - This stop is the dud.

1564
00:49:17,183 --> 00:49:19,427
- I think we'll have... - It's time they gave us food.

1565
00:49:19,513 --> 00:49:21,152
- to win next time. - There will be food.

1566
00:49:21,153 --> 00:49:23,012
- They should not pass it. - I agree.

1567
00:49:23,013 --> 00:49:24,421
- We need to hurry. - Please step on it.

1568
00:49:24,422 --> 00:49:26,188
We've passed the dud stop in the first half,

1569
00:49:26,323 --> 00:49:27,851
- so now we can enjoy the rest. - That's right.

1570
00:49:27,852 --> 00:49:28,921
Great!

1571
00:49:28,922 --> 00:49:30,262
We have arrived.

1572
00:49:30,263 --> 00:49:31,445
- What's the name of the stop? - What is it?

1573
00:49:31,823 --> 00:49:33,932
The sixth stop is, "Food Truck".

1574
00:49:33,933 --> 00:49:35,061
- What? - "Food Truck"!

1575
00:49:35,062 --> 00:49:36,191
- It's "Food Truck"! - We're getting food.

1576
00:49:36,192 --> 00:49:37,231
Will you be getting off?

1577
00:49:37,232 --> 00:49:39,139
- Yes! - We're getting off!

1578
00:49:39,232 --> 00:49:41,202
- Okay! - Let's go.

1579
00:49:41,203 --> 00:49:42,331
- Thank you. - I think it's a restaurant.

1580
00:49:42,332 --> 00:49:43,424
I'm so hungry.

1581
00:49:43,942 --> 00:49:45,441
I'm sure it's going to be a restaurant.

1582
00:49:45,442 --> 00:49:46,842
(What kind of mission will be waiting for them?)

1583
00:49:46,843 --> 00:49:47,893
What's this?

1584
00:49:48,172 --> 00:49:49,912
- What's going on? - There's a train.

1585
00:49:49,913 --> 00:49:51,065
What's this?

1586
00:49:51,283 --> 00:49:52,436
What's this?

1587
00:49:52,613 --> 00:49:53,912
There's something fascinating here!

1588
00:49:53,913 --> 00:49:55,311
It says, "Rice", "Laver",

1589
00:49:55,312 --> 00:49:56,621
"Pork kimchi jjigae", "Chocolate", "Rolled omelette", "Green chilis",

1590
00:49:56,622 --> 00:49:58,152
"Ssamjang", "Black herbal tea", "Stir-fried pork"...

1591
00:49:58,153 --> 00:50:00,251
- I think that's what we're having. - I don't think so.

1592
00:50:00,252 --> 00:50:02,351
- I think we need to put them in. - We need to put the balls in.

1593
00:50:02,352 --> 00:50:03,722
I think we're putting ping pong balls in.

1594
00:50:03,723 --> 00:50:05,253
We have to get the balls in.

1595
00:50:05,522 --> 00:50:08,461
The keyword "Food Truck"...

1596
00:50:08,462 --> 00:50:09,789
is a lunch mission.

1597
00:50:10,803 --> 00:50:12,597
- "Food Truck"! - Let's eat!

1598
00:50:13,502 --> 00:50:14,702
We will get this.

1599
00:50:14,703 --> 00:50:16,202
- Let's do this! - Let's go!

1600
00:50:16,203 --> 00:50:18,171
The mission for "Food Truck"...

1601
00:50:18,172 --> 00:50:20,072
will be using the "Lunch-deciding Train".

1602
00:50:20,073 --> 00:50:22,418
(The 6th mission will go with the "Lunch-deciding Train".)

1603
00:50:22,573 --> 00:50:25,782
There are eight items on the moving train.

1604
00:50:25,783 --> 00:50:27,791
You will have to spin around five times,

1605
00:50:27,812 --> 00:50:29,882
and if all eight of you succeed in getting a ball in one of the items,

1606
00:50:29,883 --> 00:50:32,167
you will get the food.

1607
00:50:32,283 --> 00:50:34,230
However, if two or more balls fall in the same box,

1608
00:50:34,392 --> 00:50:35,492
the food will not be served.

1609
00:50:35,493 --> 00:50:37,291
(Overlapping items will be eliminated.)

1610
00:50:37,292 --> 00:50:38,461
Two or more than two?

1611
00:50:38,462 --> 00:50:39,592
It must not fall in the same box.

1612
00:50:39,593 --> 00:50:40,632
(It's a difficult mission.)

1613
00:50:40,633 --> 00:50:41,653
In addition,

1614
00:50:41,832 --> 00:50:43,362
you'll be given six ping pong balls...

1615
00:50:43,363 --> 00:50:45,302
and two iron balls.

1616
00:50:45,303 --> 00:50:46,601
The iron balls will have to fall...

1617
00:50:46,602 --> 00:50:48,932
in Coach 1 and Coach 8, in order for you to succeed.

1618
00:50:48,933 --> 00:50:49,941
Really?

1619
00:50:49,942 --> 00:50:51,842
The iron balls will make it difficult.

1620
00:50:51,843 --> 00:50:54,171
- This is too hard. - How will we get this?

1621
00:50:54,172 --> 00:50:56,041
- We need to get the timing right. - That's right.

1622
00:50:56,042 --> 00:50:57,112
It takes time to roll down.

1623
00:50:57,113 --> 00:50:58,643
We can try as many times as we wish, so let's give it a try.

1624
00:50:58,843 --> 00:51:00,382
- Start! - Start!

1625
00:51:00,383 --> 00:51:02,211
We have to roll it when the train is here.

1626
00:51:02,212 --> 00:51:03,232
Start!

1627
00:51:03,482 --> 00:51:04,604
Get ready.

1628
00:51:04,723 --> 00:51:05,722
- Around here. - Go!

1629
00:51:05,723 --> 00:51:07,351
- You have to begin! - One.

1630
00:51:07,352 --> 00:51:08,780
- We need to set the rules. - Two.

1631
00:51:08,852 --> 00:51:10,015
- 3. - 3.

1632
00:51:10,093 --> 00:51:11,391
- 4. - 4.

1633
00:51:11,392 --> 00:51:12,391
- 5! - 5!

1634
00:51:12,392 --> 00:51:13,861
- Put it in! - Hurry!

1635
00:51:14,492 --> 00:51:17,701
(What will be the result?)

1636
00:51:17,702 --> 00:51:19,660
- It's going to work. - It'll go in one of the coaches.

1637
00:51:19,847 --> 00:51:22,541
(They win the food of the coach the ball enters.)

1638
00:51:22,542 --> 00:51:24,740
(They fail the mission if the ball misses.)

1639
00:51:24,741 --> 00:51:27,371
(Will the ball go into a coach?)

1640
00:51:27,372 --> 00:51:29,110
(Haha wins chocolate.)

1641
00:51:29,111 --> 00:51:30,110
- Chocolate. - Chocolate.

1642
00:51:30,111 --> 00:51:31,611
- What? For goodness' sake. - Chocolate.

1643
00:51:31,852 --> 00:51:34,681
We will get the most number of balls in that coach.

1644
00:51:34,682 --> 00:51:35,780
Chocolate.

1645
00:51:35,781 --> 00:51:37,121
Chocolate.

1646
00:51:37,122 --> 00:51:38,320
I got the hang of it.

1647
00:51:38,321 --> 00:51:39,443
Who will go next?

1648
00:51:39,721 --> 00:51:41,621
- I will go next. - Good luck.

1649
00:51:41,622 --> 00:51:42,891
Kwang Soo, you need to spin.

1650
00:51:42,892 --> 00:51:44,758
- You need to spin. - Spin.

1651
00:51:45,031 --> 00:51:46,286
- Hurry up. One. - He started off too late.

1652
00:51:46,332 --> 00:51:47,331
- Two. - He is fast.

1653
00:51:47,332 --> 00:51:48,530
- Three. - Go slower.

1654
00:51:48,531 --> 00:51:49,831
- Four. - There you go.

1655
00:51:49,832 --> 00:51:51,228
- Five. - Go.

1656
00:51:51,531 --> 00:51:53,130
(Putting in)

1657
00:51:53,131 --> 00:51:54,700
- My goodness. - He did it.

1658
00:51:54,701 --> 00:51:56,340
This is good.

1659
00:51:56,341 --> 00:51:57,361
It will be rolled omelette.

1660
00:51:57,671 --> 00:52:00,570
(If it goes into Coach 4, they will lose chocolate.)

1661
00:52:00,571 --> 00:52:02,110
(What will be the result?)

1662
00:52:02,111 --> 00:52:03,481
- Green chilis. - Yes.

1663
00:52:03,482 --> 00:52:06,351
(They acquire green chilis and ssamjang.)

1664
00:52:06,352 --> 00:52:07,943
Green chilis. Green chilis.

1665
00:52:08,321 --> 00:52:09,450
(They succeeded, but...)

1666
00:52:09,451 --> 00:52:10,471
You did it.

1667
00:52:11,321 --> 00:52:13,291
- I am dizzy. - You are dizzy, right?

1668
00:52:13,921 --> 00:52:15,691
- Seok Jin. - Get pork kimchi jjigae.

1669
00:52:15,692 --> 00:52:17,521
It will be incredible if you succeed in one go.

1670
00:52:17,522 --> 00:52:19,161
Rolled omelette will be nice, too.

1671
00:52:19,162 --> 00:52:20,831
(The train runs towards Seok Jin.)

1672
00:52:20,832 --> 00:52:22,561
- Seok Jin. - You need to start.

1673
00:52:22,562 --> 00:52:23,661
- Start. - One.

1674
00:52:23,662 --> 00:52:25,170
- Two. - Go slowly.

1675
00:52:25,171 --> 00:52:26,431
- Three. - Go.

1676
00:52:26,432 --> 00:52:28,070
(He spins rather slowly.)

1677
00:52:28,071 --> 00:52:29,371
- Put it in. - It's too fast.

1678
00:52:29,372 --> 00:52:30,541
- Put it in. - Put it in.

1679
00:52:30,542 --> 00:52:31,641
(What?)

1680
00:52:31,642 --> 00:52:32,641
- Put it in. - I can't believe him!

1681
00:52:32,642 --> 00:52:35,010
- Hurry up and put it in. - Put it in.

1682
00:52:35,011 --> 00:52:36,981
(He falls down.)

1683
00:52:37,912 --> 00:52:40,809
- It hasn't gone in yet. - What is he doing?

1684
00:52:40,812 --> 00:52:41,841
No, no.

1685
00:52:42,921 --> 00:52:44,550
That seemed intentional.

1686
00:52:44,551 --> 00:52:45,571
No.

1687
00:52:46,122 --> 00:52:47,720
We could have gotten stir-fried pork.

1688
00:52:47,721 --> 00:52:49,061
That seemed intentional.

1689
00:52:49,062 --> 00:52:50,291
- Seok Jin. - Stir-fried pork.

1690
00:52:50,292 --> 00:52:51,931
It was strange that you couldn't put it in.

1691
00:52:51,932 --> 00:52:53,053
What?

1692
00:52:53,462 --> 00:52:55,061
Why couldn't you put it in?

1693
00:52:55,062 --> 00:52:57,431
- I was too dizzy. - My goodness.

1694
00:52:57,432 --> 00:52:59,831
- You haven't tried it. - You got enough screen time.

1695
00:52:59,832 --> 00:53:01,228
Go easy on the slapstick comedy.

1696
00:53:01,801 --> 00:53:03,570
Why are you so sensitive?

1697
00:53:03,571 --> 00:53:06,211
- He is sensitive. - He got enough screen time.

1698
00:53:06,212 --> 00:53:08,581
Seok Jin did many things.

1699
00:53:08,582 --> 00:53:10,840
Why does he try to be funny every single time?

1700
00:53:10,841 --> 00:53:12,239
Let the others get some screen time.

1701
00:53:12,412 --> 00:53:15,420
Let me tell you this. If you think this is impossible,

1702
00:53:15,421 --> 00:53:17,181
- pick a member as collateral. - No, we will complete this mission.

1703
00:53:17,182 --> 00:53:18,720
- We won't put up collateral. - You will get three side dishes...

1704
00:53:18,721 --> 00:53:21,220
if you succeed the collateral mission.

1705
00:53:21,221 --> 00:53:22,561
(3 side dishes for a successful collateral mission)

1706
00:53:22,562 --> 00:53:23,785
Three side dishes?

1707
00:53:24,221 --> 00:53:25,831
Let's try this. In my opinion...

1708
00:53:25,832 --> 00:53:27,360
- Let's go. - We can do this.

1709
00:53:27,361 --> 00:53:29,900
Haha, you should go first. Go.

1710
00:53:29,901 --> 00:53:31,161
(Haha will go 1st on the 2nd try)

1711
00:53:31,162 --> 00:53:32,431
Who will use the iron ball?

1712
00:53:32,432 --> 00:53:33,731
There are two iron balls.

1713
00:53:33,732 --> 00:53:35,470
We should try using it. I will do it.

1714
00:53:35,471 --> 00:53:37,271
- Give it a try. - Go.

1715
00:53:37,272 --> 00:53:38,741
- Go. - Go. One.

1716
00:53:38,942 --> 00:53:40,340
- Two. - I will put it...

1717
00:53:40,341 --> 00:53:42,110
- in the stir-fried coach. - 3. 4.

1718
00:53:42,111 --> 00:53:43,311
- 4. - The last one. 5.

1719
00:53:43,312 --> 00:53:45,015
- The iron ball will be fast. - Five.

1720
00:53:45,551 --> 00:53:46,711
- Hurry up. - Put it in there.

1721
00:53:46,712 --> 00:53:48,139
(Putting in)

1722
00:53:49,352 --> 00:53:50,952
- Hurry up. - Put it in there.

1723
00:53:51,892 --> 00:53:54,720
(The iron ball spins.)

1724
00:53:54,721 --> 00:53:56,320
- What? - What is going on?

1725
00:53:56,321 --> 00:53:57,749
(They didn't expect the delay.)

1726
00:53:59,192 --> 00:54:02,831
(The iron ball needs to go in the rice or stir-fried pork coach.)

1727
00:54:02,832 --> 00:54:06,095
(They didn't expect the iron ball to spin.)

1728
00:54:06,531 --> 00:54:09,570
(Will the spin work to their advantage?)

1729
00:54:09,571 --> 00:54:12,441
(What will be the result?)

1730
00:54:12,442 --> 00:54:16,155
(Haha acquires stir-fried pork.)

1731
00:54:16,682 --> 00:54:19,506
(The miracle of the spinning iron ball)

1732
00:54:20,051 --> 00:54:22,225
(The short man who makes the iron ball spin)

1733
00:54:22,852 --> 00:54:26,422
(The iron ball spun miraculously...)

1734
00:54:27,321 --> 00:54:30,021
(and went into the last coach.)

1735
00:54:30,022 --> 00:54:31,561
No way!

1736
00:54:31,562 --> 00:54:32,561
(Haha has magic hands.)

1737
00:54:32,562 --> 00:54:34,260
- No way. - You succeeded...

1738
00:54:34,261 --> 00:54:36,342
- because the iron ball spun. - Seriously.

1739
00:54:36,562 --> 00:54:38,030
- Go, go. - It was thrilling.

1740
00:54:38,031 --> 00:54:39,231
- It was a movie. - The train is slower now.

1741
00:54:39,232 --> 00:54:40,762
It was a movie.

1742
00:54:41,531 --> 00:54:43,340
- Seriously. - Go, go.

1743
00:54:43,341 --> 00:54:44,570
- Go. - It's time.

1744
00:54:44,571 --> 00:54:45,811
(So Min will try to put in a ping pong ball.)

1745
00:54:45,812 --> 00:54:47,740
- Go. - One.

1746
00:54:47,741 --> 00:54:48,761
Spin faster, So Min.

1747
00:54:48,912 --> 00:54:50,081
- 2. - 2.

1748
00:54:50,082 --> 00:54:52,150
- You are too slow. - You need to spin faster.

1749
00:54:52,151 --> 00:54:53,510
- Go. - Five.

1750
00:54:53,511 --> 00:54:54,531
Go.

1751
00:54:54,982 --> 00:54:57,780
Gosh, what are you doing?

1752
00:54:57,781 --> 00:54:59,420
(The train breaks.)

1753
00:54:59,421 --> 00:55:00,521
What is wrong with you?

1754
00:55:00,522 --> 00:55:01,720
I couldn't do it.

1755
00:55:01,721 --> 00:55:02,720
- So Min. - I...

1756
00:55:02,721 --> 00:55:05,241
- Are you serious? - I am really dizzy.

1757
00:55:06,091 --> 00:55:07,090
Hold on.

1758
00:55:07,091 --> 00:55:08,630
The iron ball...

1759
00:55:08,631 --> 00:55:10,130
- went into stir-fried pork. - Did I do that?

1760
00:55:10,131 --> 00:55:11,900
- Did I do that? - She broke everything.

1761
00:55:11,901 --> 00:55:13,094
Did I do that?

1762
00:55:13,701 --> 00:55:15,001
Who else do you think did it?

1763
00:55:15,002 --> 00:55:17,441
If the train is broken, you will fail the mission.

1764
00:55:17,442 --> 00:55:19,641
We can fix this.

1765
00:55:19,642 --> 00:55:21,041
We lost stir-fried pork.

1766
00:55:21,042 --> 00:55:22,240
That's too bad.

1767
00:55:22,241 --> 00:55:23,911
- We lost stir-fried pork. - That's right.

1768
00:55:23,912 --> 00:55:25,584
I won't get the timing right.

1769
00:55:25,611 --> 00:55:27,110
It won't happen again. It will be hard.

1770
00:55:27,111 --> 00:55:30,008
If we fail a few more times, we should put up collateral.

1771
00:55:30,721 --> 00:55:32,891
- This is... - That's our only hope.

1772
00:55:32,892 --> 00:55:34,150
We will need to pick someone...

1773
00:55:34,151 --> 00:55:36,161
- as collateral. - This mission is impossible.

1774
00:55:36,162 --> 00:55:39,497
It's about time we pick So Min as collateral.

1775
00:55:39,732 --> 00:55:41,431
If we fail one more time, it will be over.

1776
00:55:41,432 --> 00:55:43,331
- So Min... - So Min will succeed.

1777
00:55:43,332 --> 00:55:44,831
- It's moving. - Let's do this.

1778
00:55:44,832 --> 00:55:47,030
It's moving. Thank goodness it's fixed.

1779
00:55:47,031 --> 00:55:49,929
- You will start over. - Okay. Let's do this.

1780
00:55:50,341 --> 00:55:51,441
Let's go.

1781
00:55:51,442 --> 00:55:52,941
I will try the iron ball first.

1782
00:55:52,942 --> 00:55:54,777
- There are two iron balls. - I will try the iron ball first.

1783
00:55:54,942 --> 00:55:56,311
He will be a hero if he succeeds.

1784
00:55:56,312 --> 00:55:57,380
- Here it comes. - Here it comes.

1785
00:55:57,381 --> 00:55:58,510
- Shall I start? - No.

1786
00:55:58,511 --> 00:56:00,681
(The train moves toward Jong Kook.)

1787
00:56:00,682 --> 00:56:01,780
- Shall I start? - It's time.

1788
00:56:01,781 --> 00:56:03,320
- I will start. - Go.

1789
00:56:03,321 --> 00:56:05,331
- 1, 2. - He is fast.

1790
00:56:05,352 --> 00:56:06,677
- He is fast. - Three.

1791
00:56:07,091 --> 00:56:08,461
- Four. - Go.

1792
00:56:08,462 --> 00:56:10,291
- It's time. - Go.

1793
00:56:10,292 --> 00:56:12,291
- It's time. - Now is the time.

1794
00:56:12,292 --> 00:56:14,260
- All right. - I think it's too late.

1795
00:56:14,261 --> 00:56:15,331
Hurry up.

1796
00:56:15,332 --> 00:56:16,382
(Putting in)

1797
00:56:17,432 --> 00:56:20,226
(The iron ball spins again.)

1798
00:56:21,332 --> 00:56:22,361
What?

1799
00:56:22,772 --> 00:56:24,470
- It will work. - What?

1800
00:56:24,471 --> 00:56:26,240
(Will the spin lead to success again?)

1801
00:56:26,241 --> 00:56:28,041
- He did it! - He did it!

1802
00:56:28,042 --> 00:56:29,062
He did it!

1803
00:56:29,542 --> 00:56:31,755
(He spun the iron ball with his careful touch...)

1804
00:56:32,412 --> 00:56:34,962
(and got it into the stir-fried pork coach.)

1805
00:56:35,221 --> 00:56:37,150
- That was incredible. - I calculated it.

1806
00:56:37,151 --> 00:56:38,691
How did you calculate it?

1807
00:56:38,692 --> 00:56:39,720
That makes no sense.

1808
00:56:39,721 --> 00:56:41,251
I can't believe him.

1809
00:56:41,252 --> 00:56:43,057
- How did he do that? - I counted.

1810
00:56:43,122 --> 00:56:44,621
Jong Kook.

1811
00:56:44,622 --> 00:56:46,561
- He succeeded. - In that case...

1812
00:56:46,562 --> 00:56:48,805
We need to get rice now.

1813
00:56:48,832 --> 00:56:49,831
- Should I go next? - Go.

1814
00:56:49,832 --> 00:56:51,001
- Okay. - Go.

1815
00:56:51,002 --> 00:56:52,170
(Haha will try the iron ball.)

1816
00:56:52,171 --> 00:56:53,331
You need to hurry up.

1817
00:56:53,332 --> 00:56:54,900
Rice. Here I go.

1818
00:56:54,901 --> 00:56:56,070
- I know. - You are too late.

1819
00:56:56,071 --> 00:56:57,101
If you can't get rice...

1820
00:56:57,102 --> 00:56:58,240
- Two. - He is fast.

1821
00:56:58,241 --> 00:56:59,240
- Three. - Hold on.

1822
00:56:59,241 --> 00:57:00,271
- Four. - Go.

1823
00:57:00,272 --> 00:57:01,541
- It's time. - Put it in.

1824
00:57:01,542 --> 00:57:03,010
- Put it in now. - Okay.

1825
00:57:03,011 --> 00:57:04,981
(He spins fast and puts in the iron ball.)

1826
00:57:05,412 --> 00:57:06,738
- Okay. - My goodness.

1827
00:57:08,781 --> 00:57:11,181
(Haha spun the iron ball and got stir-fried pork before.)

1828
00:57:11,182 --> 00:57:14,282
(Will he succeed to get rice this time?)

1829
00:57:15,122 --> 00:57:16,720
(My goodness.)

1830
00:57:16,721 --> 00:57:18,048
It was too fast.

1831
00:57:18,832 --> 00:57:20,431
- Okay. - My goodness.

1832
00:57:20,432 --> 00:57:22,033
It was too fast.

1833
00:57:22,232 --> 00:57:23,630
- Why was it so fast? - It didn't spin.

1834
00:57:23,631 --> 00:57:24,958
Why didn't it spin?

1835
00:57:25,732 --> 00:57:27,700
- It spun before. - Is this a different iron ball?

1836
00:57:27,701 --> 00:57:29,441
- Why didn't it spin? - It didn't spin.

1837
00:57:29,442 --> 00:57:30,828
Is this remote controlled?

1838
00:57:31,002 --> 00:57:32,141
It didn't spin.

1839
00:57:32,142 --> 00:57:33,271
Had it spun, he would have gotten rice.

1840
00:57:33,272 --> 00:57:35,811
Haha dropped it in the middle.

1841
00:57:35,812 --> 00:57:37,641
The ball should have touched the wall.

1842
00:57:37,642 --> 00:57:39,181
Let's put up collateral.

1843
00:57:39,611 --> 00:57:41,181
- Maybe that's the only choice. - Let's put up collateral.

1844
00:57:41,182 --> 00:57:42,621
- Okay. - That's the only choice.

1845
00:57:42,622 --> 00:57:43,720
Let's put up collateral.

1846
00:57:43,721 --> 00:57:46,550
I have a suggestion. I will let you start...

1847
00:57:46,551 --> 00:57:48,791
with iron balls in stir-fried pork and rice coaches...

1848
00:57:48,792 --> 00:57:51,021
if you put up small collateral.

1849
00:57:51,022 --> 00:57:52,191
- Is there such thing? - Shall we do that?

1850
00:57:52,192 --> 00:57:54,831
The mission would be easier that way.

1851
00:57:54,832 --> 00:57:56,770
If we are going to go down either way, let's try it.

1852
00:57:57,002 --> 00:57:59,070
- We will put up small collateral. - Small collateral.

1853
00:57:59,071 --> 00:58:00,300
- All right. - Small collateral.

1854
00:58:00,301 --> 00:58:01,800
Which member will you pick?

1855
00:58:01,801 --> 00:58:02,800
So Min.

1856
00:58:02,801 --> 00:58:04,070
(So Min.)

1857
00:58:04,071 --> 00:58:05,271
(She must take responsibility for the train wreck.)

1858
00:58:05,272 --> 00:58:07,485
Small collateral? Okay.

1859
00:58:07,571 --> 00:58:09,112
So Min, here is your collateral mission.

1860
00:58:09,912 --> 00:58:11,340
(If she completes the collateral mission,)

1861
00:58:11,341 --> 00:58:12,739
(they will try the mission with iron balls in the coaches.)

1862
00:58:12,912 --> 00:58:15,010
(What will be So Min's collateral mission?)

1863
00:58:15,011 --> 00:58:16,820
When there is a male guest,

1864
00:58:16,821 --> 00:58:19,550
wear strange makeup alone for the opening three times.

1865
00:58:19,551 --> 00:58:20,550
- What? - Excuse me?

1866
00:58:20,551 --> 00:58:24,132
(Wear strange makeup alone for the opening 3 times.)

1867
00:58:24,292 --> 00:58:25,731
- Are you serious? - It's only for the opening.

1868
00:58:25,732 --> 00:58:27,431
- It's not small collateral. - Seriously.

1869
00:58:27,432 --> 00:58:28,461
It's big.

1870
00:58:28,462 --> 00:58:30,231
- Alone? I mean... - So Min, you can do it.

1871
00:58:30,232 --> 00:58:31,431
So Min, you might look cute.

1872
00:58:31,432 --> 00:58:32,470
- It will be better. - So Min,

1873
00:58:32,471 --> 00:58:34,431
they will fall for your charms.

1874
00:58:34,432 --> 00:58:36,740
Even if male guests come,

1875
00:58:36,741 --> 00:58:38,541
they will only work and leave.

1876
00:58:38,542 --> 00:58:40,641
I am on Running Man...

1877
00:58:40,642 --> 00:58:42,211
because I want to get married through this show.

1878
00:58:42,212 --> 00:58:43,740
(I want to get married through this show.)

1879
00:58:43,741 --> 00:58:45,311
(She dreams of getting married through a variety show.)

1880
00:58:45,312 --> 00:58:47,811
Don't do this to me. I am serious.

1881
00:58:47,812 --> 00:58:49,621
It will be hard to do that through Running Man.

1882
00:58:49,622 --> 00:58:51,621
This is where I meet male celebrities.

1883
00:58:51,622 --> 00:58:53,420
- 3 times. - How about 1 strong makeup?

1884
00:58:53,421 --> 00:58:54,720
- That's right. - One strong makeup.

1885
00:58:54,721 --> 00:58:56,161
If it's really bad, she can do it only once.

1886
00:58:56,162 --> 00:58:58,561
- The opening won't last long. - It doesn't concern you.

1887
00:58:58,562 --> 00:58:59,630
Don't say that. We are a family.

1888
00:58:59,631 --> 00:59:01,630
- I would do it. - I would do it, too.

1889
00:59:01,631 --> 00:59:03,700
- I would do it, too. - I would do it three times.

1890
00:59:03,701 --> 00:59:06,283
So Min. One...

1891
00:59:06,732 --> 00:59:08,262
Don't take pictures.

1892
00:59:08,272 --> 00:59:09,800
- There will be multiple cameras. - Two.

1893
00:59:09,801 --> 00:59:11,840
There will be dozens of cameras.

1894
00:59:11,841 --> 00:59:12,941
Three.

1895
00:59:12,942 --> 00:59:14,747
- Okay. - So Min is the best.

1896
00:59:14,912 --> 00:59:16,952
You will wear really strange makeup once.

1897
00:59:17,212 --> 00:59:19,251
Don't turn her into a sumo wrestler.

1898
00:59:19,252 --> 00:59:21,087
(Don't turn her into a sumo wrestler.)

1899
00:59:21,781 --> 00:59:23,413
- That's right. - It could be something like that.

1900
00:59:23,622 --> 00:59:25,450
(A sumo wrestler?)

1901
00:59:25,451 --> 00:59:28,021
- A sumo wrestler? - It could be something like that.

1902
00:59:28,022 --> 00:59:31,461
(She is perfectly in sync.)

1903
00:59:31,462 --> 00:59:32,990
(What kind of makeup will she wear?)

1904
00:59:32,991 --> 00:59:35,103
So Min will do a good job.

1905
00:59:35,232 --> 00:59:36,231
(The 2 iron balls are in the coaches.)

1906
00:59:36,232 --> 00:59:37,792
I suffered the same thing.

1907
00:59:37,832 --> 00:59:39,362
Let's start over.

1908
00:59:39,372 --> 00:59:40,627
- Kwang Soo, you should go. - Okay.

1909
00:59:41,002 --> 00:59:42,776
- Don't start yet. - Don't start yet.

1910
00:59:43,102 --> 00:59:45,340
- We will have lunch. - Let's have lunch.

1911
00:59:45,341 --> 00:59:46,811
Stand up.

1912
00:59:46,812 --> 00:59:48,141
(They will succeed if they put ping pong balls in the coaches.)

1913
00:59:48,142 --> 00:59:49,811
Here it comes.

1914
00:59:49,812 --> 00:59:51,811
- Check the speed. - Come on.

1915
00:59:51,812 --> 00:59:53,610
- Go. - That's too fast.

1916
00:59:53,611 --> 00:59:55,420
- Faster. - Five.

1917
00:59:55,421 --> 00:59:57,320
- It's coming. - Put it in.

1918
00:59:57,321 --> 00:59:59,024
(Putting in)

1919
00:59:59,892 --> 01:00:02,238
- There you go. - Pork kimchi jjigae!

1920
01:00:02,662 --> 01:00:04,990
(It looks like the ball will go in.)

1921
01:00:04,991 --> 01:00:07,891
(It's between chocolate and pork kimchi jjigae.)

1922
01:00:07,892 --> 01:00:11,731
(Will they get chocolate or pork kimchi jjigae?)

1923
01:00:11,732 --> 01:00:13,931
(What will be the result?)

1924
01:00:13,932 --> 01:00:15,371
- Pork kimchi jjigae! - Yes!

1925
01:00:15,372 --> 01:00:16,570
(They acquire pork kimchi jjigae.)

1926
01:00:16,571 --> 01:00:19,804
(The king of meals, pork kimchi jjigae)

1927
01:00:20,442 --> 01:00:21,492
You did it.

1928
01:00:21,741 --> 01:00:23,036
- You did it. - Okay.

1929
01:00:23,582 --> 01:00:25,141
Get rolled omelette.

1930
01:00:25,142 --> 01:00:26,450
- Rolled omelette. - Let's go.

1931
01:00:26,451 --> 01:00:28,013
Get rolled omelette.

1932
01:00:28,252 --> 01:00:29,812
When should I start spinning?

1933
01:00:30,352 --> 01:00:32,090
- When should I start spinning? - Now! Go!

1934
01:00:32,091 --> 01:00:33,214
- Go. - Go.

1935
01:00:33,252 --> 01:00:34,251
- Go slowly. - One.

1936
01:00:34,252 --> 01:00:35,251
- 2. - 2.

1937
01:00:35,252 --> 01:00:36,720
- Three. - Go slowly.

1938
01:00:36,721 --> 01:00:37,860
- Four. - Slowly.

1939
01:00:37,861 --> 01:00:39,891
- Five. - Go slowly, Se Chan.

1940
01:00:39,892 --> 01:00:41,090
- Go, put it in. - No.

1941
01:00:41,091 --> 01:00:42,431
- No, not yet. - Put it in.

1942
01:00:42,432 --> 01:00:43,828
I need to put it in.

1943
01:00:44,002 --> 01:00:45,231
He got it.

1944
01:00:45,232 --> 01:00:47,101
- It will be rolled omelet. - Rolled omelet.

1945
01:00:47,102 --> 01:00:48,530
(Menu is canceled if the ball drops in the same goal twice.)

1946
01:00:48,571 --> 01:00:51,254
(What's the result?)

1947
01:00:51,841 --> 01:00:53,240
Rolled omelet!

1948
01:00:53,241 --> 01:00:55,010
(He obtains rolled omelet.)

1949
01:00:55,011 --> 01:00:58,641
(Rolled omelet is the highlight of a meal.)

1950
01:00:58,642 --> 01:01:00,009
- Rolled omelet. - Rolled omelet.

1951
01:01:00,511 --> 01:01:02,287
- Nice. - That's insane.

1952
01:01:03,122 --> 01:01:04,785
This is like a buffet.

1953
01:01:04,852 --> 01:01:08,054
I'm happy. I wasn't sacrificed in vain.

1954
01:01:08,221 --> 01:01:10,490
- Next is Ji Hyo. - Ji Hyo.

1955
01:01:10,491 --> 01:01:12,431
- How about dried laver? - Go for green chilis.

1956
01:01:12,432 --> 01:01:14,360
- I'll go for green chilis. - Dried laver is good too.

1957
01:01:14,361 --> 01:01:16,561
- Get ready. - Black herbal tea is fine too.

1958
01:01:16,562 --> 01:01:17,684
Get ready.

1959
01:01:17,861 --> 01:01:19,070
- Start. - Go.

1960
01:01:19,071 --> 01:01:20,970
- 1, 2. - 1, 2.

1961
01:01:20,971 --> 01:01:22,641
- Go faster. - Three.

1962
01:01:22,642 --> 01:01:24,570
(Running Man's ace, Ji Hyo gives a try.)

1963
01:01:24,571 --> 01:01:25,911
- You're done. - Five.

1964
01:01:25,912 --> 01:01:26,911
- Wait. - Do I put it in?

1965
01:01:26,912 --> 01:01:28,010
Put it in.

1966
01:01:28,011 --> 01:01:29,010
No.

1967
01:01:29,011 --> 01:01:30,211
No, no.

1968
01:01:30,212 --> 01:01:32,050
(Other members' opinions on timing differ.)

1969
01:01:32,051 --> 01:01:33,181
- Hey. - It's too late.

1970
01:01:33,182 --> 01:01:35,293
- We're doomed. - It's stir-fried pork.

1971
01:01:35,522 --> 01:01:38,481
(If she fails, all dishes are canceled.)

1972
01:01:38,482 --> 01:01:40,320
(What's the result?)

1973
01:01:40,321 --> 01:01:42,161
(What?)

1974
01:01:42,162 --> 01:01:43,720
(Oh, no...)

1975
01:01:43,721 --> 01:01:45,118
- It missed. - It was too late.

1976
01:01:45,192 --> 01:01:46,589
She failed.

1977
01:01:46,591 --> 01:01:47,755
Why were you late?

1978
01:01:47,761 --> 01:01:51,431
She's the king of destruction today.

1979
01:01:51,432 --> 01:01:52,758
What's wrong with you?

1980
01:01:52,971 --> 01:01:54,431
She ruins every mission today.

1981
01:01:54,432 --> 01:01:57,001
- What's wrong with her? - You guys say different things.

1982
01:01:57,002 --> 01:01:58,429
- You should've listened to me. - Others said no.

1983
01:01:58,542 --> 01:02:00,347
You flipped the table when I was about to eat kimchi jjigae.

1984
01:02:01,741 --> 01:02:04,811
(She destroyed a feast that the others had prepared.)

1985
01:02:04,812 --> 01:02:06,240
She's the king of destruction.

1986
01:02:06,682 --> 01:02:08,078
Unbelievable, Ji Hyo.

1987
01:02:08,151 --> 01:02:09,713
Pick collateral.

1988
01:02:09,951 --> 01:02:11,553
- Pick collateral. - Collateral.

1989
01:02:11,852 --> 01:02:13,147
- Let's pick one. - Let's go.

1990
01:02:13,252 --> 01:02:14,950
Who will pick the collateral?

1991
01:02:14,951 --> 01:02:16,691
- Let's play rock-paper-scissors. - Let's be fair.

1992
01:02:16,692 --> 01:02:17,860
Rock-paper-scissors is a good idea.

1993
01:02:17,861 --> 01:02:19,086
- You play. - We'll just win.

1994
01:02:19,091 --> 01:02:20,231
- We can play. - Rock-paper-scissors.

1995
01:02:20,232 --> 01:02:21,456
Rock-paper-scissors.

1996
01:02:21,662 --> 01:02:22,760
Rock-paper-scissors.

1997
01:02:22,761 --> 01:02:25,001
(The king of destruction, Ji Hyo wins.)

1998
01:02:25,002 --> 01:02:26,530
- Ji Hyo won. - Only Ji Hyo won.

1999
01:02:26,531 --> 01:02:29,541
(After throwing over the table, she becomes the only winner.)

2000
01:02:29,542 --> 01:02:31,371
- What? - Get out.

2001
01:02:31,372 --> 01:02:32,541
- She won. - You're excluded.

2002
01:02:32,542 --> 01:02:33,670
- Ji Hyo won. - You're excluded.

2003
01:02:33,671 --> 01:02:35,010
You're excluded, Ji Hyo.

2004
01:02:35,011 --> 01:02:36,110
Take a rest, Ji Hyo.

2005
01:02:36,111 --> 01:02:37,280
This is so annoying.

2006
01:02:37,281 --> 01:02:38,740
- That's impressive. - She's good at this though.

2007
01:02:38,741 --> 01:02:39,911
You're really impressive.

2008
01:02:39,912 --> 01:02:41,033
- Rock-paper-scissors. - Rock-paper-scissors.

2009
01:02:41,651 --> 01:02:43,581
(Kwang Soo, Seok Jin, and So Min win.)

2010
01:02:43,582 --> 01:02:44,704
- Okay. - Okay.

2011
01:02:44,951 --> 01:02:46,217
I'm so relieved.

2012
01:02:46,951 --> 01:02:48,931
- Rock-paper-scissors. - Rock-paper-scissors.

2013
01:02:49,892 --> 01:02:51,320
(Jae Seok and Se Chan win.)

2014
01:02:51,321 --> 01:02:52,485
- Okay. - Yes.

2015
01:02:53,732 --> 01:02:55,191
- Okay. - I'm sorry.

2016
01:02:55,192 --> 01:02:56,661
- Here's what I feel. - Hurry.

2017
01:02:56,662 --> 01:02:58,365
- I think it'll be Haha. - Keep going.

2018
01:02:58,502 --> 01:03:00,164
- It'll be Haha. - I hope it's Haha.

2019
01:03:00,171 --> 01:03:01,355
Let it be Haha.

2020
01:03:01,471 --> 01:03:03,338
Rock-paper-scissors.

2021
01:03:04,002 --> 01:03:06,827
(Haha loses.)

2022
01:03:07,372 --> 01:03:09,177
I knew it'd be him.

2023
01:03:09,412 --> 01:03:10,635
It serves him right.

2024
01:03:11,482 --> 01:03:12,777
I knew it, Haha.

2025
01:03:13,051 --> 01:03:14,989
Here's your collateral, Haha.

2026
01:03:15,451 --> 01:03:18,420
(If they fail one more time, Team Running Man fails.)

2027
01:03:18,421 --> 01:03:21,150
(What is Haha's collateral that he must not fail?)

2028
01:03:21,151 --> 01:03:23,420
Go to one of your rival barbecue restaurants in Hongdae.

2029
01:03:23,421 --> 01:03:25,191
Upload a photo of you eating on your social media.

2030
01:03:25,192 --> 01:03:26,831
Write a comment, "It's very delicious."

2031
01:03:26,832 --> 01:03:28,630
(Upload a photo of himself and comment that it's delicious...)

2032
01:03:28,631 --> 01:03:30,331
(at his rival barbecue restaurant.)

2033
01:03:30,332 --> 01:03:31,422
Oh, no.

2034
01:03:32,002 --> 01:03:34,552
- It'll hurt his restaurant's sales. - Poor thing.

2035
01:03:34,631 --> 01:03:36,371
- That's so mean. - By the way,

2036
01:03:36,372 --> 01:03:37,771
you can do it.

2037
01:03:37,772 --> 01:03:39,505
- His sense of pride... - His neighborhood should thrive.

2038
01:03:39,571 --> 01:03:41,570
- Right. - Do you understand?

2039
01:03:41,571 --> 01:03:42,610
- That's right. - Right.

2040
01:03:42,611 --> 01:03:44,211
It doesn't work if only your restaurant is successful.

2041
01:03:44,212 --> 01:03:45,240
You can do it.

2042
01:03:45,241 --> 01:03:46,333
I'm sorry,

2043
01:03:46,451 --> 01:03:47,811
but here's what's most important.

2044
01:03:47,812 --> 01:03:48,832
Our barbecue restaurant...

2045
01:03:49,182 --> 01:03:50,986
has no rivals in Hongdae.

2046
01:03:51,551 --> 01:03:52,643
He's confident.

2047
01:03:53,022 --> 01:03:55,621
The restaurant at the end of the alley...

2048
01:03:55,622 --> 01:03:56,917
- is getting competitive. - Right?

2049
01:03:57,361 --> 01:03:59,198
- You should go there. - Go to that restaurant.

2050
01:03:59,261 --> 01:04:00,291
He should go there.

2051
01:04:00,292 --> 01:04:01,530
As Jae Seok said,

2052
01:04:01,531 --> 01:04:03,300
- your neighborhood should thrive. - Yes.

2053
01:04:03,301 --> 01:04:04,700
Their neighborhood is already thriving.

2054
01:04:04,701 --> 01:04:06,640
Is that so? Is it already thriving?

2055
01:04:06,772 --> 01:04:08,709
- Is it thriving? - This is not easy.

2056
01:04:09,071 --> 01:04:10,469
Then you should thrive more.

2057
01:04:11,241 --> 01:04:13,010
It's either "O" or "X".

2058
01:04:13,011 --> 01:04:15,112
- It should be "O". - Of course.

2059
01:04:15,582 --> 01:04:19,182
If you succeed, you get a meal with three side dishes.

2060
01:04:19,912 --> 01:04:22,521
(What if Haha fails his collateral mission?)

2061
01:04:22,522 --> 01:04:25,280
(Team Running Man will fail with 3 fail stickers.)

2062
01:04:25,281 --> 01:04:28,990
(They must show the hardest dance moves at the fan-meet.)

2063
01:04:28,991 --> 01:04:31,220
(What will Haha decide?)

2064
01:04:31,221 --> 01:04:32,384
Let's do it.

2065
01:04:32,432 --> 01:04:33,530
- Do it. - He's so cool.

2066
01:04:33,531 --> 01:04:34,583
He's cool.

2067
01:04:34,991 --> 01:04:36,083
- Okay. - Let's go.

2068
01:04:36,531 --> 01:04:37,931
- Let's go. - He's so cool.

2069
01:04:37,932 --> 01:04:40,271
This is the restaurant in front of my house.

2070
01:04:40,272 --> 01:04:42,280
It's delicious.

2071
01:04:42,502 --> 01:04:43,827
You can do it.

2072
01:04:44,071 --> 01:04:45,400
(He completes his collateral mission.)

2073
01:04:45,401 --> 01:04:46,470
It's delicious.

2074
01:04:46,471 --> 01:04:48,654
It's been a while since we obtained the food this easily.

2075
01:04:49,281 --> 01:04:50,780
We really have this kimchi jjigae.

2076
01:04:50,781 --> 01:04:52,923
I hope you'll be grateful to me.

2077
01:04:53,111 --> 01:04:55,702
- Pork kimchi jjigae is delicious. - This is really good.

2078
01:04:55,852 --> 01:04:57,790
Rolled omelet is amazing.

2079
01:04:58,151 --> 01:04:59,446
It's from a food truck.

2080
01:05:00,022 --> 01:05:01,112
- Really? - No.

2081
01:05:01,852 --> 01:05:02,942
- He said no. - No?

2082
01:05:03,421 --> 01:05:04,420
(It's not from a food truck.)

2083
01:05:04,421 --> 01:05:05,760
Does it hurt to say that it is?

2084
01:05:05,761 --> 01:05:07,860
(Does it hurt to say that it is?)

2085
01:05:07,861 --> 01:05:09,156
Does it hurt to say so?

2086
01:05:09,462 --> 01:05:10,760
(54-year-old Seok Jin is short-tempered these days.)

2087
01:05:10,761 --> 01:05:12,975
Come to think of it,

2088
01:05:13,031 --> 01:05:14,800
none of us says anything nice to Seok Jin...

2089
01:05:14,801 --> 01:05:16,067
- including me. - It's okay.

2090
01:05:16,301 --> 01:05:18,670
Everyone is alone in life. It's okay.

2091
01:05:18,671 --> 01:05:22,965
Including the staff and myself, we should compliment Seok Jin.

2092
01:05:22,982 --> 01:05:24,380
I don't like such money pity.

2093
01:05:24,381 --> 01:05:27,309
("Money pity"?)

2094
01:05:27,852 --> 01:05:29,045
It's not "money pity".

2095
01:05:29,781 --> 01:05:31,006
What do you mean by money?

2096
01:05:31,551 --> 01:05:33,791
- "Money pity"? - It's "pity".

2097
01:05:33,792 --> 01:05:34,950
I don't like pity.

2098
01:05:34,951 --> 01:05:37,134
Seok Jin hasn't changed at all.

2099
01:05:37,692 --> 01:05:39,891
When Seok Jin was a rookie,

2100
01:05:39,892 --> 01:05:41,831
he got upset at me because I made fun of him.

2101
01:05:41,832 --> 01:05:43,597
He cursed at me once.

2102
01:05:44,732 --> 01:05:45,800
What did I say?

2103
01:05:45,801 --> 01:05:46,831
(Do you remember what you said?)

2104
01:05:46,832 --> 01:05:47,871
(What did I say?)

2105
01:05:47,872 --> 01:05:52,053
You piece of garbage. I'll never see you again.

2106
01:05:52,912 --> 01:05:54,441
(He's honest about what he hates.)

2107
01:05:54,442 --> 01:05:55,911
(He hates pity and being made fun of.)

2108
01:05:55,912 --> 01:05:58,211
- Seok Jin... - It's because he made fun of him.

2109
01:05:58,212 --> 01:05:59,436
(His isolated life officially started back then.)

2110
01:05:59,451 --> 01:06:01,288
- Stop. What if he cries? - It really happened.

2111
01:06:01,352 --> 01:06:02,442
I don't cry.

2112
01:06:02,821 --> 01:06:04,107
I have no tears.

2113
01:06:04,221 --> 01:06:06,950
When I put onions on my eyes with Jong Kook, I didn't cry.

2114
01:06:06,951 --> 01:06:08,150
(He makes himself appealing.)

2115
01:06:08,151 --> 01:06:09,260
Shall I make you cry?

2116
01:06:09,261 --> 01:06:11,920
(Shall I make you cry?)

2117
01:06:11,921 --> 01:06:14,030
(He bursts out laughter.)

2118
01:06:14,031 --> 01:06:15,161
Jong Kook can.

2119
01:06:15,162 --> 01:06:17,303
What if Seok Jin cries to avoid getting hit?

2120
01:06:18,162 --> 01:06:19,701
It's the last round.

2121
01:06:19,732 --> 01:06:23,271
You have 35 minutes left.

2122
01:06:23,272 --> 01:06:24,394
- What? - What?

2123
01:06:24,502 --> 01:06:26,610
You have number 7 and 8 left.

2124
01:06:26,611 --> 01:06:28,271
- You can pass one. - Okay.

2125
01:06:28,272 --> 01:06:29,811
That's the current situation.

2126
01:06:30,042 --> 01:06:31,740
Let's get to the last number.

2127
01:06:31,741 --> 01:06:33,610
(Let's get to the last match.)

2128
01:06:33,611 --> 01:06:34,851
Let's try number eight.

2129
01:06:34,852 --> 01:06:35,920
I love number eight.

2130
01:06:35,921 --> 01:06:37,220
In China,

2131
01:06:37,221 --> 01:06:39,873
- eight is a lucky number. You know? - That's right.

2132
01:06:40,551 --> 01:06:42,391
If we fail, we fail. If we win, we win.

2133
01:06:42,392 --> 01:06:43,691
- Okay, let's go. - We can do it.

2134
01:06:43,692 --> 01:06:45,191
We must avoid doing the difficult dance moves.

2135
01:06:45,192 --> 01:06:46,630
(They arrive at number 8 bus stop.)

2136
01:06:46,631 --> 01:06:48,528
The bus stop name is strange.

2137
01:06:48,631 --> 01:06:49,784
Why?

2138
01:06:50,832 --> 01:06:52,331
(What's the name of the bus stop?)

2139
01:06:52,332 --> 01:06:53,900
It's called MSG.

2140
01:06:53,901 --> 01:06:56,070
(It's English all of a sudden. MSG?)

2141
01:06:56,071 --> 01:06:57,170
The bus stop is called MSG.

2142
01:06:57,171 --> 01:06:59,926
- We have to go anyway. - Go, go, go.

2143
01:06:59,942 --> 01:07:01,541
- Move. - Or...

2144
01:07:01,542 --> 01:07:03,311
- We must succeed this time. - We must win no matter what.

2145
01:07:03,312 --> 01:07:05,280
I have a bad feeling. I got hit with whipped cream here.

2146
01:07:05,642 --> 01:07:07,519
Will it be hard to avoid? There's a pull-up bar.

2147
01:07:08,111 --> 01:07:09,220
(A pull-up bar?)

2148
01:07:09,221 --> 01:07:10,711
- What is it? - What's the pull-up bar for?

2149
01:07:11,352 --> 01:07:13,024
- What is it? - There's a pull-up bar.

2150
01:07:14,221 --> 01:07:16,058
- What are they? - There are water balloons.

2151
01:07:16,162 --> 01:07:17,446
Why is this called MSG?

2152
01:07:17,761 --> 01:07:19,496
"Water Balloon Game".

2153
01:07:19,792 --> 01:07:21,330
Is that why it's MSG?

2154
01:07:21,331 --> 01:07:22,931
MSG means Water Balloon Game.

2155
01:07:22,932 --> 01:07:24,931
This is the mission that you picked.

2156
01:07:24,932 --> 01:07:26,870
MSG mission is...

2157
01:07:26,871 --> 01:07:28,071
Water Balloon Game.

2158
01:07:28,072 --> 01:07:30,489
Four members will stand in line on each side.

2159
01:07:30,942 --> 01:07:33,410
Throw the water balloon over the pull-up bar.

2160
01:07:33,411 --> 01:07:34,510
If it doesn't pop, you pass.

2161
01:07:34,511 --> 01:07:35,665
Over the pull-up bar?

2162
01:07:35,812 --> 01:07:39,688
You'll play in a relay. You'll win if water balloons don't pop.

2163
01:07:40,282 --> 01:07:41,750
Bend your knees as you catch.

2164
01:07:41,751 --> 01:07:43,781
- Bend at the same time. - You can't simply catch it.

2165
01:07:43,782 --> 01:07:45,964
- We can do it. - It's possible.

2166
01:07:46,392 --> 01:07:48,125
It's so windy right now.

2167
01:07:48,192 --> 01:07:50,361
This much wind won't affect us.

2168
01:07:50,362 --> 01:07:51,382
(What are you talking about?)

2169
01:07:51,791 --> 01:07:54,191
(Don't use the wind as an excuse.)

2170
01:07:54,192 --> 01:07:55,191
- Seriously. - Hey.

2171
01:07:55,192 --> 01:07:56,800
- Please compliment him. - Why wouldn't the wind affect us?

2172
01:07:56,801 --> 01:07:58,330
- These aren't regular balloons. - Be quiet.

2173
01:07:58,331 --> 01:07:59,830
- There's water in them. - Enough.

2174
01:07:59,831 --> 01:08:01,931
- Even a golf ball is affected. - Let him breathe.

2175
01:08:01,932 --> 01:08:04,042
- Let Seok Jin breathe. - Okay.

2176
01:08:04,102 --> 01:08:06,741
Seok Jin might pass out due to high blood pressure.

2177
01:08:06,742 --> 01:08:08,506
I have no high blood pressure. Mine is stable.

2178
01:08:09,142 --> 01:08:11,111
- Are you angry again? - I'm not.

2179
01:08:11,112 --> 01:08:12,642
(He grips his jaw.)

2180
01:08:12,812 --> 01:08:15,710
(He sounds angry.)

2181
01:08:15,711 --> 01:08:17,558
- Are you sure you aren't angry? - You sound angry.

2182
01:08:18,121 --> 01:08:19,321
- Seok Jin. - I'm not angry.

2183
01:08:19,322 --> 01:08:20,883
Are you sure that you aren't angry?

2184
01:08:21,051 --> 01:08:22,592
"I'm not angry."

2185
01:08:23,591 --> 01:08:26,830
The current time is 3:05 p.m. You have 25 minutes left.

2186
01:08:26,831 --> 01:08:28,590
- Let's hurry. - Come on. We can win.

2187
01:08:28,591 --> 01:08:29,660
Gather around.

2188
01:08:29,661 --> 01:08:31,263
- Let's go. - Okay.

2189
01:08:31,602 --> 01:08:33,672
- 1, 2, 3. - 1, 2, 3. We got this.

2190
01:08:33,732 --> 01:08:35,404
We'll make it no matter what.

2191
01:08:35,572 --> 01:08:37,030
We'll win no matter what.

2192
01:08:37,671 --> 01:08:38,723
Let's start right away.

2193
01:08:38,772 --> 01:08:40,781
All we have to do is finish in 20 minutes.

2194
01:08:40,841 --> 01:08:42,097
- Let's go. - Let's go.

2195
01:08:42,911 --> 01:08:44,003
Kwang Soo.

2196
01:08:44,182 --> 01:08:45,987
- Stay low like this. - Okay.

2197
01:08:46,112 --> 01:08:47,250
Go.

2198
01:08:47,251 --> 01:08:48,333
(Jae Seok throws a balloon to Kwang Soo.)

2199
01:08:48,581 --> 01:08:49,750
(If it doesn't go over the bar or it pops, they fail.)

2200
01:08:49,751 --> 01:08:50,821
It worked.

2201
01:08:50,822 --> 01:08:54,015
(Where they catch the balloon is also important.)

2202
01:08:54,751 --> 01:08:57,361
(He throws the water balloon with stability.)

2203
01:08:57,362 --> 01:08:59,660
(All he has to do is catch it.)

2204
01:08:59,661 --> 01:09:02,039
(He catches it.)

2205
01:09:02,432 --> 01:09:05,160
(From Jae Seok to Kwang Soo, they succeed.)

2206
01:09:05,161 --> 01:09:06,701
- Good job. - It's possible.

2207
01:09:06,702 --> 01:09:07,793
It is possible.

2208
01:09:08,572 --> 01:09:10,040
That's right.

2209
01:09:10,041 --> 01:09:11,500
(Kwang Soo to Seok Jin)

2210
01:09:11,501 --> 01:09:13,277
- I'll start right away. - All right.

2211
01:09:13,942 --> 01:09:15,910
(It draws a perfect parabola.)

2212
01:09:15,911 --> 01:09:18,289
(Then it pops.)

2213
01:09:18,511 --> 01:09:19,651
(Seok Jin fails.)

2214
01:09:19,652 --> 01:09:21,311
- Oh, no. - I told you.

2215
01:09:21,312 --> 01:09:22,402
Bend as you catch it.

2216
01:09:22,522 --> 01:09:25,050
(As soon as he catches it, the water balloon pops.)

2217
01:09:25,051 --> 01:09:26,652
I told you. Bend as you catch it.

2218
01:09:26,692 --> 01:09:28,290
- I bent with it. - Seok Jin.

2219
01:09:28,291 --> 01:09:29,861
(It won't be easy.)

2220
01:09:29,862 --> 01:09:31,991
You should hug it instead of catching it with your hands.

2221
01:09:31,992 --> 01:09:33,231
It can be misunderstood.

2222
01:09:33,232 --> 01:09:34,260
(The wet spot can be misunderstood.)

2223
01:09:34,261 --> 01:09:36,709
(The water balloon popped at a misunderstandable spot.)

2224
01:09:37,402 --> 01:09:38,500
He peed.

2225
01:09:38,501 --> 01:09:41,123
Things are going so terribly for Seok Jin today.

2226
01:09:41,432 --> 01:09:43,071
- Gosh. - You need to bend as you catch.

2227
01:09:43,072 --> 01:09:44,163
Let me try again.

2228
01:09:45,242 --> 01:09:47,840
- Jae Seok threw it so well. - Kwang Soo is good at catching.

2229
01:09:47,841 --> 01:09:49,678
- Start again. - Start.

2230
01:09:50,182 --> 01:09:52,966
(They succeeded in the first round.)

2231
01:09:53,051 --> 01:09:54,050
Goodness.

2232
01:09:54,051 --> 01:09:56,774
(They succeed again this time.)

2233
01:09:57,982 --> 01:10:00,337
(It's so high.)

2234
01:10:00,852 --> 01:10:01,872
Okay, good job.

2235
01:10:02,992 --> 01:10:05,950
(He caught it, but it's uncomfortable.)

2236
01:10:06,461 --> 01:10:07,561
Doesn't it pop?

2237
01:10:07,562 --> 01:10:09,931
- I was startled. It was so high. - Good job.

2238
01:10:09,932 --> 01:10:12,002
Kwang Soo, it was dangerous.

2239
01:10:12,062 --> 01:10:13,561
- Hold on. - Just let it go.

2240
01:10:13,772 --> 01:10:15,261
May I throw it to Jae Seok?

2241
01:10:16,001 --> 01:10:17,241
- No? - All right.

2242
01:10:17,242 --> 01:10:18,496
He was being mean to me.

2243
01:10:19,102 --> 01:10:20,265
- All right. - Let's go.

2244
01:10:20,671 --> 01:10:21,763
I'm scared.

2245
01:10:21,841 --> 01:10:23,168
You need to make it.

2246
01:10:23,942 --> 01:10:25,309
Don't stop looking at it.

What are you doing?

2250
01:10:33,251 --> 01:10:34,250
He got it.

- What is he doing? - Oh, no.

2252
01:10:36,892 --> 01:10:38,014

2253
01:10:38,091 --> 01:10:39,315

He's on camera a lot today.

2257
01:10:44,331 --> 01:10:45,627
What's wrong?

2258
01:10:45,661 --> 01:10:47,401
Can Seok Jin go home today?

2259
01:10:47,402 --> 01:10:49,031
- What's wrong with you? - What's wrong?

2260
01:10:49,032 --> 01:10:50,271
It was slippery.

2261
01:10:50,272 --> 01:10:51,670
What's the matter with you?

2262
01:10:51,671 --> 01:10:53,370
Do you want all the cameras to follow you all day?

2263
01:10:53,371 --> 01:10:55,571
- What's wrong with him? - What's wrong?

2264
01:10:55,572 --> 01:10:56,969
He's greedy.

2265
01:10:57,142 --> 01:10:59,250
- He's greedy. - He's extremely greedy.

2266
01:10:59,251 --> 01:11:00,981
- What's wrong with you? - It was slippery.

2267
01:11:00,982 --> 01:11:02,380
You want all the cameras to only film you.

2268
01:11:02,381 --> 01:11:04,750
I slipped. My shoes are slippery.

2269
01:11:04,751 --> 01:11:05,821
He's greedy about being on camera.

2270
01:11:05,822 --> 01:11:07,651
Seok Jin is just unbelievable.

2271
01:11:07,652 --> 01:11:09,966
I'll go last. This is so annoying.

2272
01:11:10,892 --> 01:11:12,891
You can't catch like this.

2273
01:11:12,892 --> 01:11:14,460
- Receive with the whole body. - Absorb the impact.

2274
01:11:14,461 --> 01:11:16,231
- It won't be easy. - Throw it to me.

2275
01:11:16,232 --> 01:11:18,000
(They start their third round.)

2276
01:11:18,001 --> 01:11:19,601
- Let's start. - Start.

2277
01:11:19,602 --> 01:11:21,948
(From Kwang Soo to Jae Seok)

2278
01:11:22,671 --> 01:11:23,741
(The balloon goes up high.)

2279
01:11:23,742 --> 01:11:24,925
It's too high.

2280
01:11:25,001 --> 01:11:27,111
- That was good. - Catch it like this.

2281
01:11:27,112 --> 01:11:28,192
(He catches the balloon that flies high with stability.)

2282
01:11:28,742 --> 01:11:31,741
(He did catch it.)

2283
01:11:31,982 --> 01:11:34,052
He threw it up too high.

2284
01:11:34,612 --> 01:11:35,851
(Did you catch that?)

2285
01:11:35,852 --> 01:11:37,178
- Like this. - Wait.

2286
01:11:37,482 --> 01:11:39,550
- You threw it too high on purpose. - Wait.

2287
01:11:39,551 --> 01:11:40,651
Why are you taken aback?

2288
01:11:40,652 --> 01:11:42,049
Why are you taken aback?

2289
01:11:42,322 --> 01:11:43,688
Why are you taken aback?

2290
01:11:43,791 --> 01:11:45,191
We saw through your intention.

2291
01:11:45,192 --> 01:11:46,313
- I knew it. - Like this.

2292
01:11:46,331 --> 01:11:48,535
- You have to go down to catch it. - He's right.

2293
01:11:48,932 --> 01:11:50,260
How did he catch that?

2294
01:11:50,261 --> 01:11:51,431
(It should have popped.)

2295
01:11:51,432 --> 01:11:52,731
He thought it would pop,

2296
01:11:52,732 --> 01:11:54,870
- but Jae Seok caught it. - He's impressive.

2297
01:11:54,871 --> 01:11:56,606
- Who's next? - Next.

2298
01:11:57,142 --> 01:11:58,870
Go, So Min. So Min will catch it.

2299
01:11:58,871 --> 01:12:00,811
- So Min? - She can't catch it.

2300
01:12:00,812 --> 01:12:01,892
I don't think she can.

2301
01:12:01,971 --> 01:12:03,580
- Absorb the impact. - You have to sit down.

2302
01:12:03,581 --> 01:12:05,111
Hug the water balloon.

2303
01:12:05,312 --> 01:12:06,475
Here I go.

2304
01:12:06,711 --> 01:12:07,904
Don't be scared.

2305
01:12:08,411 --> 01:12:10,220
(The water balloon goes over the bar...)

2306
01:12:10,221 --> 01:12:11,885
(and it free-falls.)

2307
01:12:12,692 --> 01:12:15,491
(It goes past her.)

2308
01:12:15,492 --> 01:12:16,660
Throw it nicely.

2309
01:12:16,661 --> 01:12:17,960
I should have thrown it closer.

2310
01:12:17,961 --> 01:12:20,644
So Min, you should step back and catch it.

2311
01:12:21,161 --> 01:12:22,590
Why don't the two of you play?

2312
01:12:22,591 --> 01:12:24,160
- Let's play. - Try it.

2313
01:12:24,161 --> 01:12:25,160
- Two of you should play. - Throw it.

2314
01:12:25,161 --> 01:12:26,401
We don't have time.

2315
01:12:26,402 --> 01:12:28,000
- We have to hurry. - We really have to hurry.

2316
01:12:28,001 --> 01:12:29,201
Keep going. Start.

2317
01:12:29,202 --> 01:12:30,241
- It was too high. - Start.

2318
01:12:30,242 --> 01:12:31,293
Hug it.

2319
01:12:32,142 --> 01:12:34,271
(Seok Jin throws it with all his might.)

2320
01:12:34,272 --> 01:12:35,944
- Stop it. - He's driving me up the wall.

2321
01:12:37,242 --> 01:12:39,904
(However)

2322
01:12:40,051 --> 01:12:42,050
- Stop it. - He's driving me up the wall.

2323
01:12:42,352 --> 01:12:45,681
(The water balloon pops.)

2324
01:12:45,682 --> 01:12:47,620
(They feel frustrated.)

2325
01:12:47,621 --> 01:12:48,821
Give us a water balloon.

2326
01:12:48,822 --> 01:12:50,191
Throw it over.

2327
01:12:50,192 --> 01:12:51,861
He can neither throw nor catch it.

2328
01:12:51,862 --> 01:12:53,219
(Seok Jin drives him up the wall.)

2329
01:12:54,192 --> 01:12:55,895
- It's frustrating. - I'll go again.

2330
01:12:56,402 --> 01:12:58,676
He can neither throw nor catch it.

2331
01:12:58,932 --> 01:13:00,299
- Stay back and step forward. - Throw it lightly.

2332
01:13:00,631 --> 01:13:01,701
That's right.

2333
01:13:01,702 --> 01:13:03,741
(Of course it wouldn't work this time.)

2334
01:13:03,742 --> 01:13:05,170
We're in trouble. This won't work.

2335
01:13:05,902 --> 01:13:07,040
This won't work.

2336
01:13:07,041 --> 01:13:08,241
(Will they be able to clear the mission?)

2337
01:13:08,242 --> 01:13:09,536
Try it, Haha.

2338
01:13:09,581 --> 01:13:11,010
Haha is good at things like this.

2339
01:13:11,011 --> 01:13:12,340
He's good at playing basketball.

2340
01:13:12,341 --> 01:13:14,729
(From Jae Seok to Haha)

2341
01:13:15,452 --> 01:13:19,226
(Can Haha catch the balloon when it's thrown with stability?)

2342
01:13:19,492 --> 01:13:20,750
All right.

2343
01:13:20,751 --> 01:13:22,691
(Nice catch)

2344
01:13:22,692 --> 01:13:23,885
Nice.

2345
01:13:24,062 --> 01:13:25,760
- What happened? - Haha.

2346
01:13:25,761 --> 01:13:27,017
What happened?

2347
01:13:27,331 --> 01:13:29,660
(After catching the balloon,)

2348
01:13:29,661 --> 01:13:32,260
(his hairstyle changed suddenly.)

2349
01:13:32,261 --> 01:13:33,531
- What happened? - That's your real look.

2350
01:13:33,532 --> 01:13:34,694
- What happened? - Suddenly...

2351
01:13:34,831 --> 01:13:36,370
- Wait. - What's going on today?

2352
01:13:36,371 --> 01:13:38,106
Are you trying a new hairstyle?

2353
01:13:38,702 --> 01:13:40,370
- Seriously. - This is terrible.

2354
01:13:40,371 --> 01:13:41,596
What just happened?

2355
01:13:41,742 --> 01:13:43,080
(Isn't it foul to entertain people with a funny hairstyle?)

2356
01:13:43,081 --> 01:13:44,611
You look like the one in "Drunken Master".

2357
01:13:44,682 --> 01:13:47,151
Everyone is laughing because his hairstyle changed.

2358
01:13:47,152 --> 01:13:48,981
- What's going on today? - What's wrong with you?

2359
01:13:48,982 --> 01:13:51,050
- We don't have time. - Let's hurry.

2360
01:13:51,051 --> 01:13:52,620
- I want to try. - Okay.

2361
01:13:52,621 --> 01:13:54,351
- Ji Hyo. - I don't think she can do it.

2362
01:13:54,352 --> 01:13:55,442
- I don't think I can. - With your body,

2363
01:13:55,452 --> 01:13:57,720
- you must absorb the impact. - It's not easy.

2364
01:13:57,721 --> 01:13:59,420
(Will they pass round 2?)

2365
01:13:59,421 --> 01:14:00,731
- Nice. - Here it comes.

2366
01:14:00,732 --> 01:14:02,431
(He throws the water balloon with stability.)

2367
01:14:02,432 --> 01:14:05,155
(All she has to do is catch it.)

2368
01:14:05,301 --> 01:14:07,004
(She catches it.)

2369
01:14:07,232 --> 01:14:09,300
(She's an ace after all.)

2370
01:14:09,301 --> 01:14:10,730
That's good. You throw it.

2371
01:14:10,772 --> 01:14:13,340
(Impressive)

2372
01:14:13,341 --> 01:14:14,771
- You throw it. - That was good.

2373
01:14:14,772 --> 01:14:16,241
That was amazing.

2374
01:14:16,242 --> 01:14:17,873
You have to throw it harder than you think.

2375
01:14:18,011 --> 01:14:19,781
- Move forward as you throw it. - Throwing will be hard.

2376
01:14:19,782 --> 01:14:21,853
(The water weight makes it hard to throw it.)

2377
01:14:21,952 --> 01:14:24,781
(When it comes to ace Ji Hyo,)

2378
01:14:24,782 --> 01:14:27,790
(she has a lot of strength to rock climb.)

2379
01:14:27,791 --> 01:14:32,248
(She's bold and fearless.)

2380
01:14:32,862 --> 01:14:33,960
(There's a reason why she's an ace.)

2381
01:14:33,961 --> 01:14:35,053
Here I go.

2382
01:14:36,461 --> 01:14:40,071
(She showed her talent in every crisis.)

2383
01:14:40,072 --> 01:14:43,305
(Will she show it again this time?)

2384
01:14:43,671 --> 01:14:44,763
Here it comes.

2385
01:14:44,871 --> 01:14:46,779
(Popping)

2386
01:14:47,742 --> 01:14:49,170
- What happened? - What?

2387
01:14:49,171 --> 01:14:50,311
What was that?

2388
01:14:50,312 --> 01:14:53,510
(The water balloon pops as soon as she throws it.)

2389
01:14:53,511 --> 01:14:54,781
What was that?

2390
01:14:54,782 --> 01:14:58,219
(He's gotten wet all of a sudden.)

2391
01:14:58,581 --> 01:14:59,847
What was that?

2392
01:15:00,022 --> 01:15:02,720
(You know how strong I am.)

2393
01:15:02,721 --> 01:15:04,120
- What happened? - What was that?

2394
01:15:04,121 --> 01:15:06,233
Why don't you just splash water on me instead?

2395
01:15:06,661 --> 01:15:07,861
What was that?

2396
01:15:07,862 --> 01:15:09,701
- You're the king of destruction. - Ji Hyo.

2397
01:15:09,702 --> 01:15:11,300
As soon as I threw it...

2398
01:15:11,301 --> 01:15:14,031
- She's the king of destruction. - I was startled.

2399
01:15:14,032 --> 01:15:16,941
- How did it pop? - You have a nickname.

2400
01:15:16,942 --> 01:15:18,641
- She's the king of destruction. - I was so startled.

2401
01:15:18,642 --> 01:15:20,508
- She breaks everything. - How did it pop?

2402
01:15:20,572 --> 01:15:22,271
She's the king of destruction.

2403
01:15:22,272 --> 01:15:23,981
You have seven minutes left.

2404
01:15:23,982 --> 01:15:25,410
No.

2405
01:15:25,411 --> 01:15:27,010
- Catch it. - You can catch it.

2406
01:15:27,011 --> 01:15:28,111
(They start their seventh attempt.)

2407
01:15:28,112 --> 01:15:29,151
Here it is.

2408
01:15:29,152 --> 01:15:30,752
- Nice. - She caught it.

2409
01:15:32,251 --> 01:15:33,420
(From Seok Jin to So Min is a success.)

2410
01:15:33,421 --> 01:15:35,124
- She caught it. - She did it.

2411
01:15:35,392 --> 01:15:38,861
(They have a good feeling about it.)

2412
01:15:38,862 --> 01:15:40,061
- She caught it. - So Min should throw it now.

2413
01:15:40,062 --> 01:15:41,931
(Is it up to me now?)

2414
01:15:41,932 --> 01:15:42,931
Wait.

2415
01:15:42,932 --> 01:15:44,061
Throw it carefully.

2416
01:15:44,062 --> 01:15:45,861
(It's time for So Min to throw it.)

2417
01:15:45,862 --> 01:15:48,401
(It's not easy to throw it.)

2418
01:15:48,402 --> 01:15:49,701
- It won't go up. - Can you do this?

2419
01:15:49,702 --> 01:15:50,741
- This. - Use both hands.

2420
01:15:50,742 --> 01:15:52,670
- Throw it like this. - Use both hands.

2421
01:15:52,671 --> 01:15:53,895
- That's right. - Throw it up all the way.

2422
01:15:53,971 --> 01:15:55,210
- You got it. - She did it.

2423
01:15:55,211 --> 01:15:56,340
- That's right. - Okay.

2424
01:15:56,341 --> 01:15:57,432
(She throws the balloon with two hands.)

2425
01:15:58,282 --> 01:16:00,903
(He catches it.)

2426
01:16:01,652 --> 01:16:05,599
(From So Min to Jae Seok is a success.)

2427
01:16:07,551 --> 01:16:09,021
(I did it.)

2428
01:16:09,791 --> 01:16:11,590
- It keeps bulging out. - It's bulging out.

2429
01:16:11,591 --> 01:16:12,590
It keeps coming out.

2430
01:16:12,591 --> 01:16:14,691
- So Min passed. - Okay.

2431
01:16:14,692 --> 01:16:15,916
We can make it.

2432
01:16:16,062 --> 01:16:17,795
Let's win. We don't have much time.

2433
01:16:18,331 --> 01:16:20,514
(I'll throw it well this time, Kwang Soo.)

2434
01:16:22,171 --> 01:16:23,370
(He catches it with stability.)

2435
01:16:23,371 --> 01:16:24,524
Nice.

2436
01:16:25,001 --> 01:16:26,441
(From Jae Seok to Kwang Soo is a success.)

2437
01:16:26,442 --> 01:16:28,450
- Is it Ji Hyo's turn to catch? - Yes.

2438
01:16:29,682 --> 01:16:30,941
(Please catch it, Ji Hyo.)

2439
01:16:30,942 --> 01:16:32,003
Everyone is ready.

2440
01:16:32,442 --> 01:16:34,080
(The balloon is thrown over.)

2441
01:16:34,081 --> 01:16:35,080
(Did she catch it?)

2442
01:16:35,081 --> 01:16:36,173
Catch it.

2443
01:16:37,581 --> 01:16:38,907
She caught it.

2444
01:16:39,221 --> 01:16:42,550
(She definitely caught it.)

2445
01:16:42,551 --> 01:16:43,790
She caught it.

2446
01:16:43,791 --> 01:16:45,321
This counts.

2447
01:16:45,492 --> 01:16:46,531
It's alive.

2448
01:16:46,532 --> 01:16:48,031
She's the king of destruction.

2449
01:16:48,032 --> 01:16:49,561
- She really is. - Wait.

2450
01:16:49,562 --> 01:16:51,561
- Look at this. - She's the king of destruction.

2451
01:16:51,562 --> 01:16:53,816
The balloon wasn't tied properly.

2452
01:16:54,202 --> 01:16:56,109
It's not the balloon's fault.

2453
01:16:56,772 --> 01:16:58,970
The balloon wasn't tied properly.

2454
01:16:58,971 --> 01:17:01,929
It was like an elephant that was peeing.

2455
01:17:02,272 --> 01:17:04,382
- It was like a peeing elephant. - Be quiet.

2456
01:17:04,442 --> 01:17:06,246
- I was startled. - I saw it too.

2457
01:17:06,782 --> 01:17:08,485
It was weak at the end.

2458
01:17:08,511 --> 01:17:09,821
We don't have time.

2459
01:17:09,822 --> 01:17:10,821
Start right away.

2460
01:17:10,822 --> 01:17:12,050
Do it just like before.

2461
01:17:12,051 --> 01:17:13,521
- Catch it, So Min. - Me?

2462
01:17:13,522 --> 01:17:14,715
(They make their eighth attempt.)

2463
01:17:14,791 --> 01:17:16,420
(From Seok Jin to So Min)

2464
01:17:16,421 --> 01:17:17,460
(Will they succeed?)

2465
01:17:17,461 --> 01:17:18,760
He got it.

2466
01:17:18,761 --> 01:17:19,830
She got it.

2467
01:17:19,831 --> 01:17:21,290
(She catches it.)

2468
01:17:21,291 --> 01:17:23,000
(From Seok Jin to So Min is a success.)

2469
01:17:23,001 --> 01:17:24,660
She's good at catching now.

2470
01:17:24,661 --> 01:17:26,000
- Hurry. - She's good.

2471
01:17:26,001 --> 01:17:27,124
- Do it slowly. - With two hands.

2472
01:17:27,272 --> 01:17:28,401
- She got it. - Okay.

2473
01:17:28,402 --> 01:17:30,170
- He caught it. - Who's next?

2474
01:17:30,171 --> 01:17:32,181
(They throw and catch successfully.)

2475
01:17:32,772 --> 01:17:34,240
- Who's next? - This is intense.

2476
01:17:34,841 --> 01:17:35,892
You can take your time.

2477
01:17:36,581 --> 01:17:37,580
Take your time.

2478
01:17:37,581 --> 01:17:38,641
That's right.

2479
01:17:38,642 --> 01:17:40,038
- It's Ji Hyo's turn. - That's right.

2480
01:17:40,152 --> 01:17:41,710
- Come on, Ji Hyo. - You can catch it.

2481
01:17:41,711 --> 01:17:43,451
- That's right. - Throw it carefully.

2482
01:17:43,452 --> 01:17:45,120
(Here comes Ji Hyo, the king of destruction, again.)

2483
01:17:45,121 --> 01:17:46,691
(They don't have much time left.)

2484
01:17:46,692 --> 01:17:48,119
- The balloon becomes fragile. - Okay.

2485
01:17:48,352 --> 01:17:50,521
(Unlike an ace,)

2486
01:17:50,522 --> 01:17:53,387
(Ji Hyo destroyed all the missions.)

2487
01:17:53,432 --> 01:17:56,861
(Will she clear her name, the king of destruction?)

2488
01:17:56,862 --> 01:18:00,130
(Will she come back to being an ace?)

2489
01:18:00,131 --> 01:18:01,170
Okay.

2490
01:18:01,171 --> 01:18:02,670
(Nice catch)

2491
01:18:02,671 --> 01:18:04,340
(From Kwang Soo to Ji Hyo is a success.)

2492
01:18:04,341 --> 01:18:05,870
- Change it. - We need to change it.

2493
01:18:05,871 --> 01:18:07,300
- Ji Hyo. - We need to change it.

2494
01:18:07,772 --> 01:18:09,111
Change the balloon, Ji Hyo.

2495
01:18:09,112 --> 01:18:10,281
You can't change it.

2496
01:18:10,282 --> 01:18:11,362
You can't change it.

2497
01:18:11,742 --> 01:18:14,050
(Changing the balloon is foul.)

2498
01:18:14,051 --> 01:18:16,010
We can't change it? That's the one.

2499
01:18:16,011 --> 01:18:17,351
You can't change it.

2500
01:18:17,352 --> 01:18:18,550
You can't change it.

2501
01:18:18,551 --> 01:18:20,225
(A warning has been issued.)

2502
01:18:20,291 --> 01:18:23,260
(They try to change it in secret.)

2503
01:18:23,261 --> 01:18:24,620
You can't change it.

2504
01:18:24,621 --> 01:18:26,021
- This is the one. - We can't?

2505
01:18:26,022 --> 01:18:27,130
(They work great as a team at times like this.)

2506
01:18:27,131 --> 01:18:28,790
- All right. - This is fine.

2507
01:18:28,791 --> 01:18:30,698
Jae Seok, bring that back.

2508
01:18:30,801 --> 01:18:32,000
Okay.

2509
01:18:32,001 --> 01:18:33,500
He's strict, you know.

2510
01:18:33,732 --> 01:18:34,996
He's strict.

2511
01:18:35,301 --> 01:18:37,791
(He's watching.)

2512
01:18:38,001 --> 01:18:39,141
I'll throw it lightly.

2513
01:18:39,142 --> 01:18:40,569
- Move forward. - You have three minutes.

2514
01:18:41,742 --> 01:18:45,353
(They don't have enough time to make another attempt.)

2515
01:18:45,442 --> 01:18:46,451
(The balloon is thrown.)

2516
01:18:46,452 --> 01:18:47,451
Hey.

2517
01:18:47,452 --> 01:18:49,552
(However)

2518
01:18:50,221 --> 01:18:52,975
(The water balloon gets caught on the pull-up bar.)

2519
01:18:53,022 --> 01:18:56,090
(If they fail, they have to perform a high-level dance.)

2520
01:18:56,091 --> 01:18:59,521
(Will they fail the mission?)

2521
01:18:59,522 --> 01:19:01,260
(He catches it.)

2522
01:19:01,261 --> 01:19:02,862
It might pop.

2523
01:19:03,301 --> 01:19:05,031
(He recognized that its path was short.)

2524
01:19:05,032 --> 01:19:07,480
(Haha moves forward and catches the balloon.)

2525
01:19:07,732 --> 01:19:11,649
(From Ji Hyo to Haha is a success.)

2526
01:19:12,001 --> 01:19:13,370
We got it.

2527
01:19:13,371 --> 01:19:15,657
- Start. - It almost popped.

2528
01:19:15,772 --> 01:19:17,040
Let's save it.

2529
01:19:17,041 --> 01:19:18,877
- We don't have time. - Let's save it.

2530
01:19:19,011 --> 01:19:20,408
Please.

2531
01:19:20,711 --> 01:19:22,380
(He throws it carefully.)

2532
01:19:22,381 --> 01:19:23,677
Okay.

2533
01:19:24,782 --> 01:19:26,790
Is it over once Se Chan catches and throws it?

2534
01:19:26,791 --> 01:19:27,790
Yes.

2535
01:19:27,791 --> 01:19:28,851
- Let's go, Se Chan. - It must hurt.

2536
01:19:28,852 --> 01:19:30,160
Don't throw it too high.

2537
01:19:30,161 --> 01:19:32,201
- I know. - Throw it lightly.

2538
01:19:32,392 --> 01:19:33,531
Lightly.

2539
01:19:33,532 --> 01:19:34,590
(He tosses it as safely as possible.)

2540
01:19:34,591 --> 01:19:36,020
- Yes. - He got it.

2541
01:19:36,732 --> 01:19:40,000
(From Jong Kook to Se Chan is a success.)

2542
01:19:40,001 --> 01:19:41,701
- Please, Seok Jin. - It's the last one.

2543
01:19:41,702 --> 01:19:42,931
Clap for him.

2544
01:19:42,932 --> 01:19:44,605
- Please, Seok Jin. - It's the last one.

2545
01:19:44,841 --> 01:19:46,198
- Is it over once I catch it? - It's the last one.

2546
01:19:46,511 --> 01:19:48,071
- We win if you succeed. - This is the last one.

2547
01:19:48,072 --> 01:19:49,470
It's over if you fail.

2548
01:19:49,471 --> 01:19:50,481
(Everything depends on him.)

2549
01:19:50,482 --> 01:19:52,929
(He has never succeeded.)

2550
01:19:53,782 --> 01:19:56,580
(He never threw it over the bar.)

2551
01:19:56,581 --> 01:19:58,781
(He never caught it.)

2552
01:19:58,782 --> 01:20:02,157
(He's the biggest failure.)

2553
01:20:03,161 --> 01:20:07,037
(He's determined to succeed this time.)

2554
01:20:07,161 --> 01:20:08,790
It's over if you fail.

2555
01:20:08,791 --> 01:20:11,077
(Only 1 minute remains.)

2556
01:20:11,532 --> 01:20:12,531
Please.

2557
01:20:12,532 --> 01:20:13,670
I want to make it.

2558
01:20:13,671 --> 01:20:14,931
(They might avoid performing a high-level dance.)

2559
01:20:14,932 --> 01:20:16,401
Put your arms forward...

2560
01:20:16,402 --> 01:20:17,500
before it comes.

2561
01:20:17,501 --> 01:20:20,092
(There's no other attempt.)

2562
01:20:20,942 --> 01:20:21,970
You got this.

2563
01:20:21,971 --> 01:20:25,653
(If he doesn't catch the water balloon,)

2564
01:20:26,812 --> 01:20:31,749
(4 types of group dances prepared by the staff are waiting for them.)

2565
01:20:32,581 --> 01:20:34,321
(To avoid this,)

2566
01:20:34,322 --> 01:20:38,166
(they've been trying so hard for 5 hours.)

2567
01:20:38,621 --> 01:20:42,467
(However, if they lose the race, they'll perform one of the dances.)

2568
01:20:43,702 --> 01:20:46,731
(In order to avoid performing difficult dance,)

2569
01:20:46,732 --> 01:20:50,500
(they must accomplish their mission no matter what.)

2570
01:20:50,501 --> 01:20:53,771
(Will they be able to pull this off?)

2571
01:20:53,772 --> 01:20:56,260
(No way! He got it!)

2572
01:20:56,742 --> 01:20:57,811
We got it!

2573
01:20:57,812 --> 01:21:00,380
(With 1 minute left, Seok Jin catches the balloon from Se Chan.)

2574
01:21:00,381 --> 01:21:02,380
(The members win the race by accomplishing 3 missions.)

2575
01:21:02,381 --> 01:21:03,401
- We did it! - We did it.

2576
01:21:04,022 --> 01:21:05,021
We did it.

2577
01:21:05,022 --> 01:21:07,031
- They're about to die. - Look at their faces.

2578
01:21:07,091 --> 01:21:08,250
- My gosh. - Look at your faces.

2579
01:21:08,251 --> 01:21:10,391
We did it. We pulled it off.

2580
01:21:10,392 --> 01:21:11,521
- We did it. - Poor staff.

2581
01:21:11,522 --> 01:21:12,786
We won't do those dances.

2582
01:21:13,362 --> 01:21:14,561
- I won't. - I wasn't going to do that either.

2583
01:21:14,562 --> 01:21:16,092
- We did it. - That was awesome.

2584
01:21:16,291 --> 01:21:18,601
- Never. - This was doable.

2585
01:21:18,602 --> 01:21:20,701
- Iron Min looks very disappointed. - Yes.

2586
01:21:20,702 --> 01:21:23,598
I bet he wanted us to perform one of those dances.

2587
01:21:23,602 --> 01:21:24,601
- We have no choice now. - We won the race.

2588
01:21:24,602 --> 01:21:25,901
It was bound to happen. Our teamwork is perfect.

2589
01:21:25,902 --> 01:21:27,370
And we got better in the meantime.

2590
01:21:27,371 --> 01:21:29,170
We improved. We definitely improved.

2591
01:21:29,171 --> 01:21:30,781
And Cheol Min forgot about that part.

2592
01:21:30,782 --> 01:21:32,111
- That's right. - Of course.

2593
01:21:32,112 --> 01:21:33,781
But rules are rules.

2594
01:21:33,782 --> 01:21:35,250
We want to give a great concert to the fans though.

2595
01:21:35,251 --> 01:21:37,080
- We want to do a cool concert too. - Right.

2596
01:21:37,081 --> 01:21:38,781
We'll discuss this among ourselves.

2597
01:21:38,782 --> 01:21:40,750
We'll come up with a group choreography.

2598
01:21:40,751 --> 01:21:42,720
- Let's come up with a cool one. - Let's think about this.

2599
01:21:42,721 --> 01:21:45,090
Okay. I want you to discuss the group dance...

2600
01:21:45,091 --> 01:21:46,931
and tell us during the opening segment next week.

2601
01:21:46,932 --> 01:21:47,931
- Okay. - Okay.

2602
01:21:47,932 --> 01:21:49,090
- Great. That's neat. - I got it.

2603
01:21:49,091 --> 01:21:50,800
- We got it. - Okay.

2604
01:21:50,801 --> 01:21:51,955
(Which dance will they choose?)

2605
01:21:52,501 --> 01:21:54,170
(To my grandchildren)

2606
01:21:54,171 --> 01:21:57,671
(Their grandparents whom they miss are waiting at home.)

2607
01:21:58,902 --> 01:22:02,890
(These 8 grandchildren finally visit their grandparents' house.)

2608
01:22:02,942 --> 01:22:04,513
(Grandma, we're here!)

2609
01:22:05,142 --> 01:22:06,910
(They welcome their grandchildren with overwhelming joy to see them.)

2610
01:22:06,911 --> 01:22:10,281
(Hip grandparents are here!)

2611
01:22:10,282 --> 01:22:11,475
(Kook Soon, the youngest, 8th grader)

2612
01:22:11,921 --> 01:22:14,604
(They're spending a happy time with their grandchildren.)

2613
01:22:14,892 --> 01:22:17,339
