1
00:00:05,706 --> 00:00:07,014
- Hello. - Hi.

2
00:00:07,015 --> 00:00:08,014
Hi.

3
00:00:08,015 --> 00:00:10,055
- Hello. - Hello.

4
00:00:10,445 --> 00:00:12,545
- Hi. - Hello. Good morning, everyone.

5
00:00:12,546 --> 00:00:14,454
- Hello. - "Good morning, everyone."

6
00:00:14,455 --> 00:00:15,608
Kwang Soo.

7
00:00:15,886 --> 00:00:17,252
You were generalizing it for everyone.

8
00:00:17,426 --> 00:00:18,507
- What? - "Generalizing".

9
00:00:18,525 --> 00:00:19,954
- You're overgeneralizing it. - Yes.

10
00:00:19,955 --> 00:00:21,024
- It can be a good morning for you. - It's a good morning for you.

11
00:00:21,025 --> 00:00:22,125
but it might not be the case for others.

12
00:00:22,126 --> 00:00:24,425
- That's right. He's right. - I want you to think about...

13
00:00:24,426 --> 00:00:26,741
a neutral greeting for other people.

14
00:00:27,595 --> 00:00:28,735
How am I supposed to respond?

15
00:00:28,736 --> 00:00:30,835
- It's morning. - Mind your own business.

16
00:00:30,836 --> 00:00:33,735
Besides, I watched the episode that...

17
00:00:33,736 --> 00:00:35,235
- aired yesterday. - Okay, okay.

18
00:00:35,236 --> 00:00:36,945
We were just using the restroom briefly.

19
00:00:36,946 --> 00:00:40,005
I had no idea they would talk about prostate on a variety show.

20
00:00:40,006 --> 00:00:41,138
(A prostate conversation made it to the show.)

21
00:00:41,416 --> 00:00:44,945
(2 weeks ago, Jae Seok and Seok Jin went to the restroom.)

22
00:00:44,946 --> 00:00:47,231
(When you get old, your prostate can be a problem.)

23
00:00:47,656 --> 00:00:50,409
(Because Jong Kook was nosy, they talked about urology.)

24
00:00:51,385 --> 00:00:52,424
That aired?

25
00:00:52,425 --> 00:00:53,924
- Yes, that aired. - Listen.

26
00:00:53,925 --> 00:00:55,625
- I was so surprised. - Really? It aired?

27
00:00:55,626 --> 00:00:57,524
- My goodness, this is... - I was shocked when I heard it.

28
00:00:57,525 --> 00:00:59,024
- It's all right. - It's not that.

29
00:00:59,025 --> 00:01:00,634
- We can talk about prostate on TV. - Listen.

30
00:01:00,635 --> 00:01:01,735
- It's a medical term. - Prostate...

31
00:01:01,736 --> 00:01:03,165
- That's a medical term. - It's a medical term.

32
00:01:03,166 --> 00:01:04,264
- I know that it's a medical term, - It's a medical term.

33
00:01:04,265 --> 00:01:08,212
but Myung Soo talked about it once on TV for the first time.

34
00:01:08,435 --> 00:01:10,234
- That's right. - This is what he said back then.

35
00:01:10,235 --> 00:01:13,074
He said he could donate two meters of his prostate for me.

36
00:01:13,075 --> 00:01:15,645
- After that... Yes. - Two meters?

37
00:01:15,646 --> 00:01:17,085
You must start taking care of it at the age of 12.

38
00:01:17,086 --> 00:01:18,145
Gosh, the prostate...

39
00:01:18,146 --> 00:01:20,399
- We do learn about this at school. - That's right.

40
00:01:21,086 --> 00:01:22,085
- Right. - We learn at school.

41
00:01:22,086 --> 00:01:24,684
By the way, do you remember the slush fund?

42
00:01:24,685 --> 00:01:26,425
- Yes. - Did your wife say anything?

43
00:01:26,426 --> 00:01:27,477
(Viewers were curious about what happened after his mission.)

44
00:01:28,125 --> 00:01:31,155
(Seok Jin did the Collateral Mission on everyone's behalf.)

45
00:01:31,525 --> 00:01:33,634
(He had to give his wife the passcode...)

46
00:01:33,635 --> 00:01:35,734
(to his slush fund account and show her the statement.)

47
00:01:35,735 --> 00:01:39,104
(After giving it a lot of thought,)

48
00:01:39,105 --> 00:01:40,634
(he decided not to try the mission.)

49
00:01:40,635 --> 00:01:42,434
(He suspiciously gave up on the mission as if he had a slush fund.)

50
00:01:42,435 --> 00:01:45,027
When she watched that part, she laughed out loud.

51
00:01:45,346 --> 00:01:47,151
- She just laughed? - And she asked me a question.

52
00:01:47,346 --> 00:01:49,145
She asked me if I really had a slush fund.

53
00:01:49,146 --> 00:01:50,645
- So what did you say? - You did this again.

54
00:01:50,646 --> 00:01:52,984
- I said, "Of course, I don't." - Seok Jin went like this.

55
00:01:52,985 --> 00:01:55,255
(This is neither yes nor no.)

56
00:01:55,256 --> 00:01:58,795
When I told her that, the corner of my mouth was shaking a little.

57
00:01:58,885 --> 00:02:01,609
I could feel it shake a little, and my wife didn't see it.

58
00:02:02,525 --> 00:02:03,695
- Now, she'd know. - She would know now.

59
00:02:03,696 --> 00:02:05,624
- Right. She'll know now. - Seok Jin, say no now.

60
00:02:05,625 --> 00:02:08,217
Actually, I even saw the balance of his secret account.

61
00:02:08,835 --> 00:02:09,864
- Really? - My gosh.

62
00:02:09,865 --> 00:02:11,264
- Hey. - You even saw his balance?

63
00:02:11,265 --> 00:02:12,905
- Really? - I didn't see it on purpose.

64
00:02:12,906 --> 00:02:14,134
- I bet he bragged about it. - Seok Jin.

65
00:02:14,135 --> 00:02:15,435
It's the one I accidentally saw, right?

66
00:02:15,436 --> 00:02:17,875
Exactly. How did you see it standing up? Your eyes must be good.

67
00:02:17,876 --> 00:02:19,845
I was just standing there, and you were like this.

68
00:02:19,846 --> 00:02:20,968
- So I saw it. - Right.

69
00:02:21,346 --> 00:02:24,446
Since his eyes are bad, he increases the brightness on his phone.

70
00:02:24,545 --> 00:02:25,912
Everyone can see it.

71
00:02:25,946 --> 00:02:28,014
- Stop it. - Hey, Jong Kook.

72
00:02:28,015 --> 00:02:30,054
- What did I do? - When he unlocks his phone,

73
00:02:30,055 --> 00:02:33,655
he says. "3, 2, 5, and 6".

74
00:02:33,656 --> 00:02:36,145
- That's what old men do. - Hey, punk. You're lying!

75
00:02:36,355 --> 00:02:37,723
Don't old men do that?

76
00:02:37,765 --> 00:02:38,864
- Hey. - That dachshund.

77
00:02:38,865 --> 00:02:40,595
I'll get you a necklace strap for your phone.

78
00:02:40,596 --> 00:02:42,400
- That's enough. - Necklace strap for phones?

79
00:02:43,166 --> 00:02:45,204
- Dachshund, you stop it too. - A present for an old parent.

80
00:02:45,205 --> 00:02:46,461
That dachshund.

81
00:02:47,635 --> 00:02:49,634
- During the same mission, Haha... - That's right.

82
00:02:49,635 --> 00:02:50,745
- I saw this one too. - Haha.

83
00:02:50,746 --> 00:02:51,875
- I went to the restaurant. - He posted the photo.

84
00:02:51,876 --> 00:02:53,544
- You did it? - He did post the photo.

85
00:02:53,545 --> 00:02:54,815
- Yes. I made good on my promise. - Good job.

86
00:02:54,816 --> 00:02:55,815
- That was so cool. - He really went.

87
00:02:55,816 --> 00:02:58,090
But that restaurant was really busy.

88
00:02:58,286 --> 00:03:00,114
- I was really nervous inside. - In your selfie,

89
00:03:00,115 --> 00:03:01,715
it looked similar to your restaurant.

90
00:03:01,716 --> 00:03:03,010
- "Your restaurant"? - Oh, I misspoke.

91
00:03:04,156 --> 00:03:07,460
(It's a shocking comment from his business partner, Mr. Kim.)

92
00:03:07,656 --> 00:03:08,879
There's a rift between them.

93
00:03:09,256 --> 00:03:11,061
- That's also your restaurant too. - They're fighting.

94
00:03:11,096 --> 00:03:12,294
This must disappoint him a lot.

95
00:03:12,295 --> 00:03:15,050
Are you embarrassed that you own a barbecue restaurant?

96
00:03:15,466 --> 00:03:17,764
- Are you that embarrassed? - No, no.

97
00:03:17,765 --> 00:03:19,704
Calling it "your restaurant" was so shocking.

98
00:03:19,705 --> 00:03:21,409
It's not that. I'm just used to calling it that.

99
00:03:22,235 --> 00:03:24,405
- Right. Why didn't I tell you this? - What?

100
00:03:24,406 --> 00:03:26,375
- You went on a trip... - Yes, yes.

101
00:03:26,376 --> 00:03:29,170
- with In Sung and D.O. - That must've been a lot of work.

102
00:03:29,246 --> 00:03:30,614
- Good work. - Great work.

103
00:03:30,615 --> 00:03:31,644
What do you mean?

104
00:03:31,645 --> 00:03:33,614
- I was on a trip for pleasure. - You were their butler.

105
00:03:33,615 --> 00:03:35,420
Kwang Soo went on the trip too, but the article...

106
00:03:35,485 --> 00:03:38,719
- only mentioned In Sung and D.O. - What are you saying?

107
00:03:38,726 --> 00:03:39,854
- No, no. - But Kwang Soo,

108
00:03:39,855 --> 00:03:41,936
you were carrying a lot compared to other guys.

109
00:03:42,055 --> 00:03:43,294
What are you saying?

110
00:03:43,295 --> 00:03:44,495
You were carrying a lot.

111
00:03:44,496 --> 00:03:46,495
- I packed a lot of stuff. - Was that all yours?

112
00:03:46,496 --> 00:03:47,495
- It was all mine. - It was all yours?

113
00:03:47,496 --> 00:03:49,536
What did you do in Japan? Did you put on a show?

114
00:03:49,865 --> 00:03:50,905
What show?

115
00:03:50,906 --> 00:03:52,435
My goodness, you made a lot of money,

116
00:03:52,436 --> 00:03:54,174
- but you're still stingy. - There he goes again.

117
00:03:54,175 --> 00:03:56,113
(Did you go there to make more money?)

118
00:03:56,135 --> 00:03:57,573
- Stop talking about money. - There he goes again.

119
00:03:57,976 --> 00:03:59,144
He's talking about money again.

120
00:03:59,145 --> 00:04:00,945
- That's not why I went. - This is Round Two.

121
00:04:00,946 --> 00:04:03,315
I'm not that materialistic.

122
00:04:03,316 --> 00:04:05,445
Did you do the Gundam Show this time?

123
00:04:05,446 --> 00:04:06,614
(Was that the follow-up after the Bumblebee Show?)

124
00:04:06,615 --> 00:04:07,854
I bet he asked for 50 cents.

125
00:04:07,855 --> 00:04:09,079
(You're unbelievable.)

126
00:04:09,485 --> 00:04:10,755
I drive an imported car.

127
00:04:10,756 --> 00:04:11,854
(I'm not poor.)

128
00:04:11,855 --> 00:04:13,125
(He brags about his car which makes him look cheaper.)

129
00:04:13,126 --> 00:04:14,482
- He drives an imported car. - Listen.

130
00:04:14,696 --> 00:04:16,854
I get it. You need more money for the gas.

131
00:04:16,855 --> 00:04:18,424
- Kwang Soo's car... - To pay for the gas,

132
00:04:18,425 --> 00:04:19,997
- you need more money. - I'm greedy over money.

133
00:04:20,695 --> 00:04:22,430
- This is driving me crazy. - I'm so sick of it.

134
00:04:23,136 --> 00:04:25,705
All right. You know that your fan-meet is coming up soon.

135
00:04:25,706 --> 00:04:27,475
- Yes. - We have only two months left.

136
00:04:27,476 --> 00:04:29,535
- We only have two months left? - Will we have enough time?

137
00:04:29,536 --> 00:04:31,279
- We didn't even start. - The dance...

138
00:04:31,346 --> 00:04:33,275
You're going to give out free merchandise...

139
00:04:33,276 --> 00:04:34,907
to the fans who will be at the fan-meet.

140
00:04:35,146 --> 00:04:36,575
- There's merchandise? - We'll have merchandise too?

141
00:04:36,576 --> 00:04:38,385
- Is that so? - That's so interesting.

142
00:04:38,386 --> 00:04:40,015
- This will be a gift, right? - That's right.

143
00:04:40,016 --> 00:04:41,614
Since it's a project with our program's title,

144
00:04:41,615 --> 00:04:43,585
we're going to make 3,000 shirts with our title on it.

145
00:04:43,586 --> 00:04:45,054
- 3,000 shirts? - That many?

146
00:04:45,055 --> 00:04:46,688
If we're making 3,000 shirts...

147
00:04:46,726 --> 00:04:48,052
- Will we have 3,000 fans? - How many fans will come?

148
00:04:48,255 --> 00:04:49,254
Will 3,000 fans come?

149
00:04:49,255 --> 00:04:50,494
We'll prepare a space big enough...

150
00:04:50,495 --> 00:04:51,725
- for 2,500 to 3,000 fans. - My goodness.

151
00:04:51,726 --> 00:04:52,725
- Really? - That's a lot.

152
00:04:52,726 --> 00:04:54,635
- It must be a huge place. - We're having that many fans?

153
00:04:54,636 --> 00:04:56,135
- But that's too many. - That's a lot.

154
00:04:56,136 --> 00:04:59,035
Today, we'll decide on a design for the Running Shirts.

155
00:04:59,036 --> 00:05:00,465
We'll have to come up with a design?

156
00:05:00,466 --> 00:05:03,075
It's Part Three of our project. It's Let's Make Merchandise Race.

157
00:05:03,076 --> 00:05:04,145
Okay.

158
00:05:04,146 --> 00:05:06,696
You will come up with your own design for the shirt.

159
00:05:06,776 --> 00:05:08,515
We'll make 3,000 Running Shirts...

160
00:05:08,516 --> 00:05:11,544
- with the design of the winner. - Really?

161
00:05:12,016 --> 00:05:14,841
- I already have a design in mind. - What is it?

162
00:05:14,985 --> 00:05:16,515
I'll go with the Avengers' theme.

163
00:05:16,855 --> 00:05:17,854
And we'll put on the disguises again?

164
00:05:17,855 --> 00:05:19,655
- He will be Groot. - There you have it.

165
00:05:19,656 --> 00:05:21,254
(Kwang Soo will be Groot.)

166
00:05:21,255 --> 00:05:23,194
- There you have it. - That's great.

167
00:05:23,195 --> 00:05:24,450
Jong Kook will be the Hulk.

168
00:05:24,495 --> 00:05:26,229
- Yes, there's the Hulk. - Jong Kook will be the Hulk.

169
00:05:26,425 --> 00:05:27,595
Jong Kook is the Hulk.

170
00:05:27,596 --> 00:05:29,197
And So Min will be...

171
00:05:29,266 --> 00:05:30,364
Doctor Strange.

172
00:05:30,365 --> 00:05:32,604
- Why? - Hey, he's a guy.

173
00:05:32,605 --> 00:05:34,105
She shaves her chin too.

174
00:05:35,206 --> 00:05:37,389
- She does? - She has a beard.

175
00:05:37,445 --> 00:05:38,670
- She has a beard. - She shaves it.

176
00:05:39,045 --> 00:05:40,065
Haha is Ant-Man.

177
00:05:40,146 --> 00:05:42,614
- Ant-Man. He's the Ant-Man. - Okay.

178
00:05:42,615 --> 00:05:43,775
(We found someone for Ant-Man.)

179
00:05:43,776 --> 00:05:46,114
(He's the perfect guy for the role. No questions asked.)

180
00:05:46,115 --> 00:05:47,585
- You're Ant-Man. - Why am I Ant-Man?

181
00:05:47,586 --> 00:05:49,187
- He's the original Ant-Man. - Ant-Man.

182
00:05:49,216 --> 00:05:50,756
- Why am I Ant-Man all of a sudden. - Ant-Man.

183
00:05:50,826 --> 00:05:52,325
- You're Ant-Man. - That's perfect for you.

184
00:05:52,326 --> 00:05:54,671
For your character, you don't even have to get smaller.

185
00:05:55,695 --> 00:05:57,257
- Anyway... - You don't have to.

186
00:05:57,826 --> 00:05:58,989
That's right.

187
00:06:00,026 --> 00:06:01,635
We already call you Ant-Man...

188
00:06:01,636 --> 00:06:02,890
when you're not here.

189
00:06:02,995 --> 00:06:04,205
You can be Ant-Man.

190
00:06:04,206 --> 00:06:06,786
(They already found out Ant-Man's identity.)

191
00:06:07,906 --> 00:06:10,304
Before we start today's race, we'll give you 30 minutes...

192
00:06:10,305 --> 00:06:12,345
- to draw your own designs. - That's great.

193
00:06:12,346 --> 00:06:13,804
- I'm already done with mine. - You'll take turns...

194
00:06:13,805 --> 00:06:16,161
- to present your designs. - I already have mine.

195
00:06:17,485 --> 00:06:18,984
(This is the Running T-Shirt.)

196
00:06:18,985 --> 00:06:20,715
These are the shirts for our merchandise.

197
00:06:20,716 --> 00:06:22,515
Hey, these are basketball jerseys.

198
00:06:22,516 --> 00:06:23,708
(They can draw their own design in the middle.)

199
00:06:23,716 --> 00:06:25,929
- What should I draw? - I don't know what to draw.

200
00:06:26,055 --> 00:06:29,095
Are there other characters except for the Avengers?

201
00:06:29,096 --> 00:06:30,278
I need someone for Seok Jin.

202
00:06:30,326 --> 00:06:33,223
- Yondu is the best one I have. - I think Yondu will be funny.

203
00:06:33,425 --> 00:06:35,740
Jae Seok, I want to be Captain Marvel.

204
00:06:35,795 --> 00:06:36,886
Captain Marvel?

205
00:06:37,466 --> 00:06:38,864
I haven't watched "The Avengers" yet.

206
00:06:38,865 --> 00:06:40,135
(Feeling left out)

207
00:06:40,136 --> 00:06:42,075
("Kwang Soo's 'Inseparable Bros' Competes Against 'The Avengers'")

208
00:06:42,076 --> 00:06:43,401
- I can't follow the conversation. - Oh, right.

209
00:06:43,576 --> 00:06:44,905
- Make Ji Hyo Gamora. - Right.

210
00:06:44,906 --> 00:06:46,303
Gosh, Black Widow is so pretty.

211
00:06:46,846 --> 00:06:48,344
I guess you all liked that movie.

212
00:06:49,346 --> 00:06:50,645
I guess it was that fun to watch.

213
00:06:50,646 --> 00:06:52,380
(Clenching his teeth)

214
00:06:52,786 --> 00:06:55,254
- I know that it was a fun movie. - Hey, Haha even cried.

215
00:06:55,255 --> 00:06:56,745
Haha cried even.

216
00:06:56,786 --> 00:06:58,418
You should draw one for your movie, "Inseparable Bros".

217
00:06:58,685 --> 00:07:01,144
Yes, you should do that. What do you think?

218
00:07:01,596 --> 00:07:02,749
That's lamer.

219
00:07:03,355 --> 00:07:06,354
Why don't you put the can in your chest?

220
00:07:06,466 --> 00:07:08,165
- Why would I do that? - People can drop 10-cent coins.

221
00:07:08,166 --> 00:07:10,073
(You like money.)

222
00:07:10,136 --> 00:07:11,265
He's all about money.

223
00:07:11,266 --> 00:07:12,535
I'm all for having a new character,

224
00:07:12,536 --> 00:07:14,335
- but this is not that cool. - Go with Greedy Millipede.

225
00:07:14,336 --> 00:07:15,975
- Greedy Millipede? Seriously? - My gosh, Greedy Millipede.

226
00:07:15,976 --> 00:07:17,345
- That's a great one. - Listen.

227
00:07:17,346 --> 00:07:18,645
Make everything about insects.

228
00:07:18,646 --> 00:07:19,744
Insects?

229
00:07:19,745 --> 00:07:20,845
(What have I done wrong?)

230
00:07:20,846 --> 00:07:21,944
That's right. That one is cool.

231
00:07:21,945 --> 00:07:24,614
I won't add perspective to my drawing for now.

232
00:07:24,615 --> 00:07:25,768
- Hold on. What is it? - Is that...

233
00:07:26,646 --> 00:07:28,684
- What is that? - What is that?

234
00:07:28,685 --> 00:07:29,885
This is Captain America.

235
00:07:29,886 --> 00:07:31,253
- That's Captain America? - Yes.

236
00:07:31,255 --> 00:07:32,525
(It's a simplified version of it.)

237
00:07:32,526 --> 00:07:33,725
Isn't that Anpanman?

238
00:07:33,726 --> 00:07:35,939
- This is Captain America. - That's totally Anpanman.

239
00:07:36,195 --> 00:07:37,564
He'd be placed last...

240
00:07:37,565 --> 00:07:38,994
- even among elementary school kids. - That's so true.

241
00:07:39,266 --> 00:07:41,765
I would believe it someone says that Ji Ho drew this.

242
00:07:41,766 --> 00:07:42,990
Ji Ho is better than me.

243
00:07:44,235 --> 00:07:45,388
This is Captain America.

244
00:07:45,906 --> 00:07:47,466
I want to go with Sherlock Holmes.

245
00:07:47,505 --> 00:07:48,730
- Sherlock Holmes? - Yes.

246
00:07:49,076 --> 00:07:50,667
- You'll be Sherlock Holmes? - Yes.

247
00:07:51,305 --> 00:07:52,544
Why?

248
00:07:52,545 --> 00:07:53,698
What?

249
00:07:54,545 --> 00:07:55,814
It's a project I couldn't complete.

250
00:07:55,815 --> 00:07:57,448
I see. What kind of project was it?

251
00:07:58,846 --> 00:08:00,682
- There he goes again. - I'm sure you know, punk.

252
00:08:00,985 --> 00:08:02,114
- Seok Jin... - I'm sure...

253
00:08:02,115 --> 00:08:04,624
- you know what I mean. - He's getting mad now.

254
00:08:04,625 --> 00:08:06,054
Why do you ask when you know what it is?

255
00:08:06,055 --> 00:08:07,254
You're annoying me.

256
00:08:07,255 --> 00:08:08,895
(Why do you ask when you know what it is? You're annoying me.)

257
00:08:08,896 --> 00:08:10,655
- He's angry now. - Why are you getting mad?

258
00:08:10,656 --> 00:08:12,093
- You just got mad, right? - Seok Jin is mad.

259
00:08:12,166 --> 00:08:13,625
- He got angry. - This is nothing to be mad about.

260
00:08:13,695 --> 00:08:15,369
- He's mad. - I'm not mad.

261
00:08:15,435 --> 00:08:17,405
- Are you sure? - He asked me when he knew. I got...

262
00:08:17,406 --> 00:08:18,535
I almost got angry.

263
00:08:18,536 --> 00:08:20,239
(I got... I almost got angry.)

264
00:08:20,605 --> 00:08:22,748
- You're not angry? - I'm glad you're not angry.

265
00:08:23,435 --> 00:08:24,804
(I'll tease him again later.)

266
00:08:24,805 --> 00:08:27,151
You're good. Jong Kook, you're good at drawing Jigsaw.

267
00:08:27,276 --> 00:08:28,614
It really looks like Jigsaw.

268
00:08:28,615 --> 00:08:30,015
You'll present in five minutes.

269
00:08:30,016 --> 00:08:31,954
(His drawing is high quality when it doesn't have to be.)

270
00:08:32,246 --> 00:08:33,776
I'm ready. I'm done with mine.

271
00:08:34,356 --> 00:08:36,192
- I'm done. - Take turns to present now.

272
00:08:36,215 --> 00:08:37,285
- Okay. - Shall we start?

273
00:08:37,286 --> 00:08:39,673
Mine is very simple.

274
00:08:40,085 --> 00:08:41,248
- Is it scary? - Let me see.

275
00:08:41,795 --> 00:08:43,121
- All right. - What's that?

276
00:08:43,295 --> 00:08:45,324
- Mine is very simple. - Everyone is bald.

277
00:08:45,325 --> 00:08:47,437
2019, 9 Years of Running Man.

278
00:08:47,736 --> 00:08:50,215
I thought about people who wore undershirts.

279
00:08:50,396 --> 00:08:51,486
Let me tell you who it is.

280
00:08:52,036 --> 00:08:53,665
There's this guy, the Beast in "Kung Fu Hustle".

281
00:08:53,666 --> 00:08:55,035
- That's right. - I know who it is.

282
00:08:55,036 --> 00:08:56,474
(The Beast from "Kung Fu Hustle")

283
00:08:56,475 --> 00:08:58,574
- I know him. - We'll dress up like him.

284
00:08:58,575 --> 00:08:59,775
- That guy from the movie? - That's right.

285
00:08:59,776 --> 00:09:02,015
Everyone will be dressed up as the Beast.

286
00:09:02,016 --> 00:09:03,444
- That's cute. This is fun. - And I'll wear a suit...

287
00:09:03,445 --> 00:09:04,745
like Stephen Chow.

288
00:09:04,746 --> 00:09:06,714
I'll stand in the front while looking cool. Behind me,

289
00:09:06,715 --> 00:09:08,855
- That sounds fun. - you'll wear the undershirts.

290
00:09:08,856 --> 00:09:11,155
You'll be running to the fans in slow motion like this.

291
00:09:11,156 --> 00:09:13,063
- Okay, I got what you mean. - I got it.

292
00:09:13,886 --> 00:09:15,794
- Mine is simple. - Great, great.

293
00:09:15,795 --> 00:09:17,765
- I'll make mine simple. - This is funny.

294
00:09:17,766 --> 00:09:18,846
Should I go next?

295
00:09:19,565 --> 00:09:22,218
In my drawing, Sherlock Holmes...

296
00:09:22,396 --> 00:09:25,425
is looking for culprits with his sharp eyes.

297
00:09:25,636 --> 00:09:29,144
He has profound detective skills and is very observant.

298
00:09:29,506 --> 00:09:30,804
Around Sherlock Holmes,

299
00:09:30,805 --> 00:09:32,875
- there are many... - Why are your arms uneven?

300
00:09:32,876 --> 00:09:34,814
- Which ones? - Sherlock's arms.

301
00:09:34,945 --> 00:09:36,405
I guess he's right-handed.

302
00:09:36,475 --> 00:09:38,885
- Is he Wreck-It Ralph? - No.

303
00:09:38,886 --> 00:09:40,954
- Is it Wreck-It Ralph? - No, it's not.

304
00:09:40,955 --> 00:09:42,385
No, my drawing is just off.

305
00:09:42,386 --> 00:09:43,986
Please be understanding.

306
00:09:44,085 --> 00:09:46,025
Sherlock Holmes...

307
00:09:46,026 --> 00:09:48,054
- I want to do... - There are... Let me finish.

308
00:09:48,055 --> 00:09:49,824
- just one thing. Can I do it? - What is it?

309
00:09:49,825 --> 00:09:51,525
(Booing)

310
00:09:51,526 --> 00:09:52,594
Hey!

311
00:09:52,595 --> 00:09:55,434
(The audience disapproves of his lengthy and boring storyline.)

312
00:09:55,435 --> 00:09:56,720
I'm...

313
00:09:56,795 --> 00:09:59,105
I only introduced my character. You can't disapprove of it yet.

314
00:09:59,106 --> 00:10:00,870
If I had eggs, I would've thrown them at you.

315
00:10:01,075 --> 00:10:02,934
- I would've done that. - I only introduced my character.

316
00:10:02,935 --> 00:10:03,934
How could you do that?

317
00:10:03,935 --> 00:10:05,745
What's the character on the far left?

318
00:10:05,746 --> 00:10:06,826
- This one? - Yes.

319
00:10:07,006 --> 00:10:08,372
This is a dachshund.

320
00:10:08,575 --> 00:10:09,902
- What? - It's a dachshund.

321
00:10:10,516 --> 00:10:13,515
(He was inspired by Haha for this dachshund character.)

322
00:10:13,516 --> 00:10:15,214
Is that from "Cabbage Guru and Radish Guru"?

323
00:10:15,215 --> 00:10:16,409
Isn't that Xuanzang?

324
00:10:16,756 --> 00:10:18,684
(His drawing flusters even him.)

325
00:10:18,685 --> 00:10:20,125
- It's a dachshund. - A dachshund.

326
00:10:20,126 --> 00:10:21,454
- Please be understanding. - I thought that it was you.

327
00:10:21,455 --> 00:10:22,822
And this one is a chicken.

328
00:10:23,626 --> 00:10:24,716
Lee Kwang Soo.

329
00:10:24,866 --> 00:10:26,724
- I'm a chicken? - You'll be dressed up as a chicken.

330
00:10:26,725 --> 00:10:28,500
He'll hold an umbrella like the light card.

331
00:10:28,695 --> 00:10:29,920
- A chicken will do that? - A chicken.

332
00:10:30,736 --> 00:10:32,164
How are they related?

333
00:10:32,406 --> 00:10:33,833
It's just my imagination.

334
00:10:34,205 --> 00:10:35,405
- You're not that imaginative. - It's just my imagination.

335
00:10:35,406 --> 00:10:37,775
- You have a poor imagination. - Yes, you're terrible.

336
00:10:37,776 --> 00:10:39,611
Your imagination is lacking.

337
00:10:39,675 --> 00:10:40,868
What do you mean?

338
00:10:41,315 --> 00:10:43,415
- Why doesn't he hold a can? - No, no.

339
00:10:43,416 --> 00:10:45,584
(Since it's Kwang Soo, why doesn't he hold a can?)

340
00:10:45,585 --> 00:10:47,932
Why does Haha keep bringing up the can?

341
00:10:48,585 --> 00:10:51,237
- That's not a bad idea. - Why does he keep bringing that up?

342
00:10:51,526 --> 00:10:53,668
Why do you keep mentioning the can and 50 cents?

343
00:10:54,756 --> 00:10:56,081
Hold on. That's a great idea.

344
00:10:56,156 --> 00:10:58,543
Kwang Soo will hold a can instead of an umbrella.

345
00:10:59,065 --> 00:11:00,765
- By the way, overall... - Okay.

346
00:11:00,766 --> 00:11:02,734
I'm sorry to say this during your presentation.

347
00:11:02,766 --> 00:11:03,995
But your design doesn't come together as a whole.

348
00:11:03,996 --> 00:11:05,265
It's all over the place.

349
00:11:05,266 --> 00:11:06,905
- Mine isn't related at all. - Why not?

350
00:11:06,906 --> 00:11:09,048
- They are culprits from everywhere. - Why?

351
00:11:09,335 --> 00:11:11,344
- It's just my idea. - The viewers have to relate to it.

352
00:11:11,345 --> 00:11:13,079
It doesn't matter if we can relate to it or not.

353
00:11:13,376 --> 00:11:14,714
(His tactic of using the viewers makes a compelling case.)

354
00:11:14,715 --> 00:11:15,899
Let's keep your idea for now.

355
00:11:16,845 --> 00:11:18,825
Come on. How could you do this to me?

356
00:11:19,085 --> 00:11:20,992
- Did you hear him? - "How could you..."

357
00:11:21,156 --> 00:11:22,615
What do you mean by that?

358
00:11:22,616 --> 00:11:23,885
(What happened to his confidence?)

359
00:11:23,886 --> 00:11:27,221
And I'll be Sharp Sherlock Holmes.

360
00:11:27,325 --> 00:11:28,580
Everyone...

361
00:11:29,526 --> 00:11:30,718
(Yawning)

362
00:11:31,496 --> 00:11:32,694
(Hitting)

363
00:11:32,695 --> 00:11:33,765
That really hurts.

364
00:11:33,766 --> 00:11:35,564
(Seok Jin was never violent.)

365
00:11:35,565 --> 00:11:37,095
(He attacks Haha with his paper.)

366
00:11:37,366 --> 00:11:38,665
- He really hit Haha. - He really hit Haha.

367
00:11:38,666 --> 00:11:39,931
He really hit Haha.

368
00:11:40,565 --> 00:11:42,412
- He's really angry. - He really hit Haha.

369
00:11:42,475 --> 00:11:44,405
I'm sorry. I was going to hit your face with this.

370
00:11:44,406 --> 00:11:45,405
I'm sorry.

371
00:11:45,406 --> 00:11:47,474
- He really got mad. - I'll be...

372
00:11:47,475 --> 00:11:48,515
I will be really sharp.

373
00:11:48,516 --> 00:11:49,698
- It will be obvious... - He did get angry, right?

374
00:11:49,975 --> 00:11:51,344
- Definitely. - A sharp detective...

375
00:11:51,345 --> 00:11:52,437
I'm not angry.

376
00:11:52,746 --> 00:11:53,814
(He's not angry yet.)

377
00:11:53,815 --> 00:11:55,212
Why would I be angry at this hour?

378
00:11:55,555 --> 00:11:56,714
All right. I will be...

379
00:11:56,715 --> 00:11:58,521
You can never get angry.

380
00:11:58,626 --> 00:12:00,525
- I will be... - I've known him for 20 years.

381
00:12:00,526 --> 00:12:01,755
I've never seen him get mad.

382
00:12:01,756 --> 00:12:02,816
That jerk.

383
00:12:04,825 --> 00:12:06,907
(He gives up.)

384
00:12:07,636 --> 00:12:10,094
- That was... - Didn't he say that before?

385
00:12:10,095 --> 00:12:11,187
I told you, didn't I?

386
00:12:11,366 --> 00:12:13,406
I told you that he curses at me when he gets mad.

387
00:12:13,805 --> 00:12:15,304
- That's what he said before. - Yes.

388
00:12:15,305 --> 00:12:16,733
My gosh, I'm so livid.

389
00:12:16,876 --> 00:12:18,273
I wasn't angry.

390
00:12:18,506 --> 00:12:20,544
- I have a temper. - He cursed at me. He wasn't mad.

391
00:12:20,545 --> 00:12:22,045
(He's not angry yet. He only cursed to show they're friendly.)

392
00:12:22,345 --> 00:12:24,252
- Okay. I'll stop here. - That's it.

393
00:12:24,585 --> 00:12:26,625
- Okay. - Okay.

394
00:12:27,215 --> 00:12:28,817
- Make it simple. - Look at his drawing.

395
00:12:29,185 --> 00:12:32,215
("The Avengers: Captain Yumerica")

396
00:12:32,225 --> 00:12:33,625
You can tell from my drawing that...

397
00:12:33,626 --> 00:12:35,755
- Which one is me? - there's Captain Yumerica.

398
00:12:35,756 --> 00:12:36,924
- "Yumerica"? - "Yumerica"?

399
00:12:36,925 --> 00:12:38,496
It's just an old man.

400
00:12:39,026 --> 00:12:40,830
- Isn't that Anpanman? - Is that necessary?

401
00:12:40,965 --> 00:12:43,395
These are the characters that fit...

402
00:12:43,396 --> 00:12:45,265
- our characters. - That's true.

403
00:12:45,266 --> 00:12:47,974
Who's that man in a hanbok?

404
00:12:47,975 --> 00:12:48,974
(Who is this?)

405
00:12:48,975 --> 00:12:50,204
(He looks charismatic with an eye patch on.)

406
00:12:50,205 --> 00:12:51,327
This is...

407
00:12:52,075 --> 00:12:53,095
Gung Ye.

408
00:12:53,646 --> 00:12:54,674
Gung Ye?

409
00:12:54,675 --> 00:12:55,745
This is Gung Ye.

410
00:12:55,746 --> 00:12:57,944
(Why is he there?)

411
00:12:57,945 --> 00:12:59,814
- It's a bit... - Why is he there?

412
00:12:59,815 --> 00:13:00,938
(What does he have to do with this?)

413
00:13:01,156 --> 00:13:04,216
- Why is Gung Ye there? - I was going to draw Nick Fury.

414
00:13:04,356 --> 00:13:07,324
- But I wanted something... - Right.

415
00:13:07,325 --> 00:13:09,724
more humorous in this.

416
00:13:09,725 --> 00:13:10,995
- He's detailed. - Right.

417
00:13:10,996 --> 00:13:13,025
As you all know,

418
00:13:13,026 --> 00:13:16,024
we need to help Seok Jin become a bit more famous.

419
00:13:16,236 --> 00:13:17,235
I know...

420
00:13:17,236 --> 00:13:20,061
(Jae Seok wants to make him into a bigger star.)

421
00:13:20,106 --> 00:13:23,134
I know it doesn't fit my theme, but I chose Gung Ye.

422
00:13:23,376 --> 00:13:25,574
Why me, though?

423
00:13:25,575 --> 00:13:26,775
I know.

424
00:13:26,776 --> 00:13:29,396
- He's similar to Nick Fury. - I don't want to read minds.

425
00:13:29,746 --> 00:13:32,015
And this is Yondu.

426
00:13:32,016 --> 00:13:33,616
It'll be So Min.

427
00:13:33,815 --> 00:13:36,355
Yondu. He controls his arrow.

428
00:13:36,356 --> 00:13:37,554
- He's cool. - Yondu.

429
00:13:37,555 --> 00:13:39,084
- He comes even cooler. - I believe...

430
00:13:39,085 --> 00:13:41,294
So Min will be able to play him well.

431
00:13:41,295 --> 00:13:42,683
- Is he completely blue? - Yes.

432
00:13:42,795 --> 00:13:44,051
He is.

433
00:13:44,295 --> 00:13:45,964
- He's blue. - I see.

434
00:13:45,965 --> 00:13:50,265
This is a collaboration between the Avengers and Gung Ye.

435
00:13:50,266 --> 00:13:52,959
I strongly recommend this.

436
00:13:53,636 --> 00:13:55,605
("Avengers: Om Mani Padme Hum")

437
00:13:55,606 --> 00:13:58,074
(This is Ant-Man.)

438
00:13:58,075 --> 00:13:59,105
He draws well.

439
00:13:59,106 --> 00:14:02,134
For mine, I will be standing in the middle.

440
00:14:02,445 --> 00:14:04,344
I will be holding a rod, and there will be a Jigsaw family.

441
00:14:04,345 --> 00:14:05,645
(A Jigsaw family?)

442
00:14:05,646 --> 00:14:09,185
("The Tiger Who Subdues Jigsaws")

443
00:14:09,286 --> 00:14:10,954
Jong Kook, it doesn't look...

444
00:14:10,955 --> 00:14:12,454
- like you. - It's me.

445
00:14:12,455 --> 00:14:13,855
What's the rod for?

446
00:14:13,856 --> 00:14:15,554
- What? - What's the rod for?

447
00:14:15,555 --> 00:14:17,324
I need to hit them.

448
00:14:17,325 --> 00:14:18,964
- The Jigsaws. - I see.

449
00:14:18,965 --> 00:14:19,964
This is the Jigsaw family.

450
00:14:19,965 --> 00:14:21,365
- This is Jae Seok. - He draws well.

451
00:14:21,366 --> 00:14:23,064
- This is Jae Seok. - You're good.

452
00:14:23,065 --> 00:14:24,934
And this is So Min.

453
00:14:24,935 --> 00:14:26,035
- Really? - She has short hair.

454
00:14:26,036 --> 00:14:28,074
This is Kwang Soo. He's bald.

455
00:14:28,075 --> 00:14:29,074
I see.

456
00:14:29,075 --> 00:14:31,304
- You have some hair on the side. - Okay.

457
00:14:31,305 --> 00:14:33,505
- Can you make me completely bald? - No.

458
00:14:33,506 --> 00:14:34,645
- No? - We need that bit of hair.

459
00:14:34,646 --> 00:14:36,645
- We need it. - He's a tall one.

460
00:14:36,646 --> 00:14:38,145
This is Ji Hyo.

461
00:14:38,185 --> 00:14:40,844
- Haha has reggae hair. - I see.

462
00:14:40,845 --> 00:14:42,447
- He's reggae Jigsaw. - Reggae.

463
00:14:42,815 --> 00:14:44,525
- This is... - That one's riding a bicycle.

464
00:14:44,526 --> 00:14:45,655
Seok Jin.

465
00:14:45,656 --> 00:14:47,655
- This is Seok Jin. - What?

466
00:14:47,656 --> 00:14:48,924
I forgot Se Chan.

467
00:14:48,925 --> 00:14:50,155
Where am I?

468
00:14:50,156 --> 00:14:52,094
- Wait. Where's me? - Hold on.

469
00:14:52,095 --> 00:14:53,350
I forgot about you.

470
00:14:53,565 --> 00:14:56,265
(He feels betrayed.)

471
00:14:56,266 --> 00:14:58,035
- It's scary. - Tell him that he's the bicycle.

472
00:14:58,036 --> 00:14:59,704
Se Chan, you're the bicycle.

473
00:14:59,705 --> 00:15:00,865
- That's me? - Yes.

474
00:15:00,866 --> 00:15:02,334
- That's me? - You're the bicycle.

475
00:15:02,335 --> 00:15:03,834
- I'm the bicycle? - Yes.

476
00:15:03,835 --> 00:15:05,742
- Your teeth protrude. - Right.

477
00:15:05,876 --> 00:15:08,444
He's the bicycle. And here's Seok Jin.

478
00:15:08,445 --> 00:15:09,574
He's riding me?

479
00:15:09,575 --> 00:15:12,544
I like this. It looks cool.

480
00:15:12,545 --> 00:15:13,943
I think that will be nice.

481
00:15:13,945 --> 00:15:15,925
- All right. - For my design,

482
00:15:16,185 --> 00:15:18,025
- I'll be surrounded... - What is that?

483
00:15:18,026 --> 00:15:21,045
by the staff members.

484
00:15:21,325 --> 00:15:22,655
- Are we the staff? - Are you...

485
00:15:22,656 --> 00:15:25,025
- Are you the star? - Yes, I am.

486
00:15:25,026 --> 00:15:27,934
I'll have my legs crossed in this drawing.

487
00:15:27,935 --> 00:15:29,934
Jae Seok is my makeup artist.

488
00:15:29,935 --> 00:15:30,995
- That's good. - Me?

489
00:15:30,996 --> 00:15:32,405
- Okay. - This is his back.

490
00:15:32,406 --> 00:15:33,905
- That's his back? - Is my face not shown?

491
00:15:33,906 --> 00:15:35,059
Yes, it's his back.

492
00:15:35,376 --> 00:15:38,344
Seok Jin is my manager.

493
00:15:38,345 --> 00:15:39,444
This will be it.

494
00:15:39,445 --> 00:15:40,496
(He's considerate.)

495
00:15:40,705 --> 00:15:41,868
It's his eye.

496
00:15:42,545 --> 00:15:43,875
- That's it? - And his nose.

497
00:15:43,876 --> 00:15:45,645
- That's it? - Yes, this much.

498
00:15:45,646 --> 00:15:46,745
(His nose is too big.)

499
00:15:46,746 --> 00:15:49,255
- 30 percent of his face is shown. - He's still in it.

500
00:15:49,256 --> 00:15:50,255
Where's Haha?

501
00:15:50,256 --> 00:15:52,837
He's here. He's Ant-Man.

502
00:15:53,585 --> 00:15:55,094
- All of a sudden? - Suddenly?

503
00:15:55,095 --> 00:15:58,224
(He's pretty much a dot.)

504
00:15:58,225 --> 00:15:59,449
Okay.

505
00:15:59,496 --> 00:16:01,334
I really love that character.

506
00:16:01,335 --> 00:16:03,165
- It suits him. - So...

507
00:16:03,166 --> 00:16:05,105
Give me a sketchbook. Let me draw something in a hurry.

508
00:16:05,106 --> 00:16:06,360
- No. - I can't stand this.

509
00:16:06,366 --> 00:16:08,007
He's a dot.

510
00:16:08,036 --> 00:16:09,405
- Okay. - He'll be small.

511
00:16:09,406 --> 00:16:11,038
("A Day of a Prince")

512
00:16:11,675 --> 00:16:15,317
I was inspired by Kwang Soo's drawing.

513
00:16:16,246 --> 00:16:17,949
We will be standing in a line in the order of our age.

514
00:16:18,416 --> 00:16:19,814
- We will be facing the rear. - And then?

515
00:16:19,815 --> 00:16:23,049
And this much of my face will be seen.

516
00:16:23,756 --> 00:16:25,388
What I want to portray is...

517
00:16:25,486 --> 00:16:27,219
that everyone...

518
00:16:27,526 --> 00:16:29,495
can be like us.

519
00:16:29,496 --> 00:16:31,054
- Our faces? - When we wear it?

520
00:16:31,055 --> 00:16:32,294
Yes.

521
00:16:32,295 --> 00:16:34,094
I was inspired to draw this.

522
00:16:34,095 --> 00:16:35,391
That's creative.

523
00:16:35,396 --> 00:16:37,273
By the way, it shouldn't have been that difficult...

524
00:16:37,496 --> 00:16:39,679
to line the feet when you were drawing this.

525
00:16:40,666 --> 00:16:42,775
(The line is ascending.)

526
00:16:42,776 --> 00:16:44,944
- It's rising. - Their feet became smaller.

527
00:16:44,945 --> 00:16:47,005
Is Haha the smallest?

528
00:16:47,006 --> 00:16:48,275
- I see. - Why me?

529
00:16:48,276 --> 00:16:49,275
(Ji Hyo is a true believer of realism.)

530
00:16:49,276 --> 00:16:50,944
- It just happened to be so. - He's Ant-Man, you see.

531
00:16:50,945 --> 00:16:51,944
You're right.

532
00:16:51,945 --> 00:16:54,740
- It'll be simple. - It is.

533
00:16:54,786 --> 00:16:56,714
- Who's next? - Go, So Min.

534
00:16:56,715 --> 00:16:58,355
Yours is colorful.

535
00:16:58,356 --> 00:17:00,019
Yes, it is.

536
00:17:00,256 --> 00:17:01,554
- What is that? - This is...

537
00:17:01,555 --> 00:17:02,554
- What is that? - Tinky-Winky?

538
00:17:02,555 --> 00:17:03,554
This is...

539
00:17:03,555 --> 00:17:06,626
("The Seven Colors of Running Man")

540
00:17:06,866 --> 00:17:08,964
This is like how when you go to the clubs,

541
00:17:08,965 --> 00:17:11,165
there are clothes that glow in the dark.

542
00:17:11,166 --> 00:17:12,734
They have purple lights at karaoke.

543
00:17:12,735 --> 00:17:15,875
Yes, I want to do that to you guys.

544
00:17:15,876 --> 00:17:21,674
I want them to wear tights or get painted in these colors.

545
00:17:21,675 --> 00:17:22,774
Body painting?

546
00:17:22,775 --> 00:17:24,214
- This is crazy. - I always say this,

547
00:17:24,215 --> 00:17:25,845
- but we can't let her do this. - I know.

548
00:17:25,846 --> 00:17:27,045
- We can't allow her to do that. - I'll stop her at all costs.

549
00:17:27,046 --> 00:17:28,688
- She can't do that. - I will stop her.

550
00:17:28,886 --> 00:17:30,313
- That's risky. - Body painting?

551
00:17:30,316 --> 00:17:32,325
It will be pitch-dark.

552
00:17:32,326 --> 00:17:33,655
I will receive the spotlight.

553
00:17:33,656 --> 00:17:35,924
You will surround me in rainbow colors...

554
00:17:35,925 --> 00:17:39,024
with body paint or tights.

555
00:17:39,025 --> 00:17:41,295
Since navy is similar to blue,

556
00:17:41,296 --> 00:17:43,395
Kwang Soo will just wear black tights.

557
00:17:43,396 --> 00:17:44,635
(Kwang Soo will wear black tights.)

558
00:17:44,636 --> 00:17:45,764
(Kwang Soo)

559
00:17:45,765 --> 00:17:48,034
Hold on. If I'm wearing black in the dark,

560
00:17:48,035 --> 00:17:49,674
I will be invisible.

561
00:17:49,675 --> 00:17:50,905
You can say that.

562
00:17:50,906 --> 00:17:52,645
- You'll be... - There's no black glow-in-the-dark.

563
00:17:52,646 --> 00:17:54,744
Right. Just consider yourself a part of the background.

564
00:17:54,745 --> 00:17:56,510
I'm not sure about this.

565
00:17:56,846 --> 00:17:57,944
Okay.

566
00:17:57,945 --> 00:17:59,014
Isn't it pretty?

567
00:17:59,015 --> 00:18:01,014
("The Seven Colors of Running Man", Annoyingness,)

568
00:18:01,015 --> 00:18:02,923
Mine is cute so that...

569
00:18:03,485 --> 00:18:05,325
- you will all like it. - What?

570
00:18:05,326 --> 00:18:07,825
- It is adorable. - This was my original drawing.

571
00:18:07,826 --> 00:18:08,994
It's cute.

572
00:18:08,995 --> 00:18:12,464
But after seeing your drawings, I got a bit upset.

573
00:18:12,465 --> 00:18:14,505
- Why? - I was nothing but a dot.

574
00:18:14,666 --> 00:18:16,194
- No, you're Ant-Man. - You're Ant-Man.

575
00:18:16,195 --> 00:18:18,072
- Come on. - So...

576
00:18:18,836 --> 00:18:20,605
- this is my new drawing. - What is it?

577
00:18:20,606 --> 00:18:22,818
(What could it be?)

578
00:18:22,975 --> 00:18:26,107
("I Sometimes Shed Tears")

579
00:18:26,205 --> 00:18:27,296
In this drawing,

580
00:18:27,576 --> 00:18:30,911
I will be the only one looking good in the center.

581
00:18:31,015 --> 00:18:32,645
Do you remember those photoshopped photos...

582
00:18:32,646 --> 00:18:34,315
of you all with Se Chan?

583
00:18:34,316 --> 00:18:36,954
I will use those photoshopped faces.

584
00:18:36,955 --> 00:18:39,085
- No. - I will use them.

585
00:18:39,086 --> 00:18:40,784
Your original faces won't be in this.

586
00:18:40,785 --> 00:18:43,194
- It's the worst. - "I don't care who it is."

587
00:18:43,195 --> 00:18:44,295
The order doesn't matter to me.

588
00:18:44,296 --> 00:18:45,622
- That's terrible. - However,

589
00:18:45,796 --> 00:18:48,346
Kwang Soo won't even have a photoshopped picture.

590
00:18:48,465 --> 00:18:50,934
- It will just be his neck. - That's my body?

591
00:18:50,935 --> 00:18:53,204
(It will just be his neck.)

592
00:18:53,205 --> 00:18:54,674
(He can't believe it.)

593
00:18:54,675 --> 00:18:56,605
- Why is he doing this? - This is too much.

594
00:18:56,606 --> 00:18:58,805
In case you guys don't like this,

595
00:18:58,806 --> 00:19:00,029
I drew myself only.

596
00:19:00,275 --> 00:19:02,774
- It's... - You don't look like that.

597
00:19:02,775 --> 00:19:05,233
- We've been in this for 10 years. - Why are you crying?

598
00:19:05,346 --> 00:19:07,283
We've received so much love...

599
00:19:07,816 --> 00:19:10,014
- for the past 10 years. - You're the only one in it?

600
00:19:10,015 --> 00:19:12,534
Since I'm so thankful,

601
00:19:12,656 --> 00:19:15,694
I'll pose with teary eyes and a smile.

602
00:19:15,695 --> 00:19:17,754
- Like this. - That's disgusting.

603
00:19:17,755 --> 00:19:19,224
- Like this. - That's terrible.

604
00:19:19,225 --> 00:19:22,335
(Dear fans, I'm always grateful for you.)

605
00:19:22,336 --> 00:19:23,565
Ma'am!

606
00:19:23,566 --> 00:19:25,234
What do bring up my mom suddenly?

607
00:19:25,235 --> 00:19:27,653
(Is that Haha's mother?)

608
00:19:27,765 --> 00:19:29,105
- That's Haha's mom! - How is it?

609
00:19:29,106 --> 00:19:30,774
- That's Haha's mom! - I'll have teary eyes.

610
00:19:30,775 --> 00:19:32,444
- You know what this is, right? - I do know.

611
00:19:32,445 --> 00:19:33,504
- I'll be emotional. - I get it.

612
00:19:33,505 --> 00:19:34,815
- And... - What's behind you?

613
00:19:34,816 --> 00:19:37,091
you will all be dots.

614
00:19:37,715 --> 00:19:39,045
You're just several of these countless dots.

615
00:19:39,046 --> 00:19:41,855
- So we don't come out? - I'm the only one visible.

616
00:19:41,856 --> 00:19:44,284
It'll be 1 of these 2.

617
00:19:44,285 --> 00:19:45,355
We're all dots.

618
00:19:45,356 --> 00:19:47,655
He's the only one in his drawings.

619
00:19:47,656 --> 00:19:51,327
("I Sometimes Shed Tears")

620
00:19:51,525 --> 00:19:54,264
(The Running T-Shirts will be chosen by the winner.)

621
00:19:54,265 --> 00:19:56,847
Today will be part three of Nine Years of Running Man,

622
00:19:56,866 --> 00:19:58,497
Burdensome Race.

623
00:19:59,636 --> 00:20:02,734
2 individuals will make a team. There will be 4 teams in total.

624
00:20:02,735 --> 00:20:03,774
Okay.

625
00:20:03,775 --> 00:20:05,575
The team with the most R Money wins.

626
00:20:05,576 --> 00:20:08,197
Among the 2 members, only 1 will be the final winner.

627
00:20:08,376 --> 00:20:10,645
Two teams with the lowest rank will be penalized.

628
00:20:10,646 --> 00:20:11,808
There's a penalty?

629
00:20:12,485 --> 00:20:13,615
- What is it? - What's the penalty?

630
00:20:13,616 --> 00:20:16,267
This is the back side of the merchandise.

631
00:20:16,616 --> 00:20:18,385
(On the back side of the Running T-Shirt,)

632
00:20:18,386 --> 00:20:20,085
(the losers will be drawn on the bottom.)

633
00:20:20,086 --> 00:20:23,555
The losers will be drawn on the bottom part.

634
00:20:23,556 --> 00:20:24,625
They will be crushed by the bottom.

635
00:20:24,626 --> 00:20:26,424
If you sit, the two members won't be seen.

636
00:20:26,425 --> 00:20:27,424
Oh, no.

637
00:20:27,425 --> 00:20:29,740
- It's the worst. - Only two?

638
00:20:30,366 --> 00:20:32,004
That must feel terrible.

639
00:20:32,005 --> 00:20:33,290
Goodness.

640
00:20:34,366 --> 00:20:36,674
The mission fund is crucial.

641
00:20:36,675 --> 00:20:39,174
You will be given either 30 dollars...

642
00:20:39,175 --> 00:20:41,375
or the chance to throw a die.

643
00:20:41,376 --> 00:20:43,545
You will be given the amount shown on the die.

644
00:20:43,546 --> 00:20:44,815
If you get a 6, you'll be given 60 dollars.

645
00:20:44,816 --> 00:20:46,415
If you don't want to throw it,

646
00:20:46,416 --> 00:20:48,155
- you'll be given 30 dollars. - All right.

647
00:20:48,156 --> 00:20:49,236
We will throw it.

648
00:20:49,485 --> 00:20:51,454
However, if you get a three,

649
00:20:51,455 --> 00:20:52,915
- you won't be getting any. - What?

650
00:20:53,126 --> 00:20:55,401
(Getting a 3 means you won't receive any money.)

651
00:20:56,025 --> 00:20:57,994
- We should avoid that. - We should.

652
00:20:57,995 --> 00:20:59,264
- We should avoid getting it. - Yes.

653
00:20:59,265 --> 00:21:00,795
- We shouldn't get it. - And one too.

654
00:21:00,796 --> 00:21:02,665
We can get 10 or 20 dollars.

655
00:21:02,666 --> 00:21:03,835
- Right. - Let's do it.

656
00:21:03,836 --> 00:21:05,263
Who'll throw a die first?

657
00:21:05,866 --> 00:21:06,865
I will.

658
00:21:06,866 --> 00:21:09,105
All right. Sorry, we're booked.

659
00:21:09,106 --> 00:21:11,012
(Someone else has booked to throw the die already.)

660
00:21:11,306 --> 00:21:12,428
What?

661
00:21:13,005 --> 00:21:14,444
- Here. - Is it for me? Thank you.

662
00:21:14,445 --> 00:21:15,774
It was booked.

663
00:21:15,775 --> 00:21:17,674
- The die was booked? - Yes.

664
00:21:17,675 --> 00:21:19,214
(He can't reserve on the spot.)

665
00:21:19,215 --> 00:21:21,868
Se Chan, what will you choose?

666
00:21:22,015 --> 00:21:23,280
I will throw the die.

667
00:21:23,656 --> 00:21:26,055
- We need to risk it. - Yes.

668
00:21:26,056 --> 00:21:27,825
- There's 4, 5, and 6. - Right.

669
00:21:27,826 --> 00:21:29,222
- Let's go! - Let's go.

670
00:21:29,995 --> 00:21:32,665
(Se Chan opts for the die instead of 30 dollars.)

671
00:21:32,666 --> 00:21:33,849
- Let's see. - Please. It's a high number!

672
00:21:34,525 --> 00:21:37,902
(He just needs to avoid getting a 3 or lower.)

673
00:21:38,435 --> 00:21:40,067
(Getting a 6 will be the best.)

674
00:21:41,136 --> 00:21:42,674
If you get a three, you won't be getting any.

675
00:21:42,675 --> 00:21:44,715
(He will receive no money.)

676
00:21:45,275 --> 00:21:47,305
(The die rolls and lands on 3.)

677
00:21:47,306 --> 00:21:48,397
You're getting no money!

678
00:21:48,975 --> 00:21:50,944
(They show different emotions.)

679
00:21:50,945 --> 00:21:53,056
- He gets nothing! - Nice shot!

680
00:21:53,245 --> 00:21:55,355
- Nice shot! - It's possible to get a three.

681
00:21:55,356 --> 00:21:56,784
- Nice shot. - Yes!

682
00:21:56,785 --> 00:21:57,877
He failed!

683
00:21:58,015 --> 00:21:59,689
I got a three?

684
00:22:00,455 --> 00:22:02,639
I shouldn't team up with him.

685
00:22:02,826 --> 00:22:04,994
I doubt another three would come out after that round.

686
00:22:04,995 --> 00:22:07,665
The possibility is extremely low.

687
00:22:07,666 --> 00:22:09,095
It won't come out.

688
00:22:09,096 --> 00:22:10,165
That's impossible.

689
00:22:10,166 --> 00:22:12,511
- He should get 3 or 1. - 1 is good too.

690
00:22:13,806 --> 00:22:16,575
(He slams the die.)

691
00:22:16,576 --> 00:22:17,831
- What? - That was cool.

692
00:22:19,005 --> 00:22:21,454
(Give me a 6!)

693
00:22:21,916 --> 00:22:23,885
(He's my role model.)

694
00:22:25,116 --> 00:22:27,984
(Will his powerful slamming reap fruits?)

695
00:22:27,985 --> 00:22:29,014
Six!

696
00:22:29,015 --> 00:22:31,415
(He gets a 6!)

697
00:22:31,416 --> 00:22:32,684
- Do it again. - Six!

698
00:22:32,685 --> 00:22:34,484
- Do it again. - That doesn't count.

699
00:22:34,485 --> 00:22:36,363
- You can't slam it. - Why again?

700
00:22:36,396 --> 00:22:37,924
- You can't do that. - You should've thrown it.

701
00:22:37,925 --> 00:22:38,994
- What game is he playing? - You slammed it.

702
00:22:38,995 --> 00:22:40,024
- You shouldn't do that. - It's just my style.

703
00:22:40,025 --> 00:22:41,424
- You shouldn't do that. - You should throw it.

704
00:22:41,425 --> 00:22:43,034
- It looked cool. - Seok Jin.

705
00:22:43,035 --> 00:22:44,365
Young fans will watch this and mimic you.

706
00:22:44,366 --> 00:22:45,565
- That's right. - It's dangerous.

707
00:22:45,566 --> 00:22:46,665
It's dangerous.

708
00:22:46,666 --> 00:22:48,335
- They could injure their faces. - It's too aggressive.

709
00:22:48,336 --> 00:22:49,934
- Why isn't this allowed? - It's too aggressive.

710
00:22:49,935 --> 00:22:52,944
My child gets scolded for throwing things too.

711
00:22:52,945 --> 00:22:54,274
This is rolling.

712
00:22:54,275 --> 00:22:55,815
- What you did was slamming. - Gosh.

713
00:22:55,816 --> 00:22:56,815
It's because...

714
00:22:56,816 --> 00:22:58,815
- I got a six. - Give him a round of applause.

715
00:22:58,816 --> 00:23:00,115
(They applaud him for not getting mad.)

716
00:23:00,116 --> 00:23:02,254
Let's laugh it off!

717
00:23:02,255 --> 00:23:03,284
- Smile! - Move on!

718
00:23:03,285 --> 00:23:05,091
- Laugh it off. - Laugh it off.

719
00:23:05,785 --> 00:23:06,924
- Laugh it off. - Okay, okay.

720
00:23:06,925 --> 00:23:08,691
- I'll throw it. - Okay.

721
00:23:10,025 --> 00:23:11,759
- What was that? - This is my style.

722
00:23:12,166 --> 00:23:14,264
- It's your style? - Yes.

723
00:23:14,265 --> 00:23:15,264
(Will he get a 6?)

724
00:23:15,265 --> 00:23:17,295
- 1! - 1! This is acceptable.

725
00:23:17,296 --> 00:23:18,693
(He gets a 1.)

726
00:23:19,606 --> 00:23:21,534
(Hold on.)

727
00:23:21,535 --> 00:23:22,674
- This is fun. - It is.

728
00:23:22,675 --> 00:23:24,335
That was cute.

729
00:23:24,336 --> 00:23:25,805
The kids will mimic me again.

730
00:23:25,806 --> 00:23:27,145
- They will mimic me. - Let them!

731
00:23:27,146 --> 00:23:29,012
- That was cute. - Laugh it off.

732
00:23:29,316 --> 00:23:30,601
Seok Jin will get 10 dollars.

733
00:23:30,616 --> 00:23:32,315
How could you allow this and not the other one?

734
00:23:32,316 --> 00:23:33,539
(Seok Jin gets 10 dollars.)

735
00:23:33,715 --> 00:23:34,815
Are you throwing it?

736
00:23:34,816 --> 00:23:36,693
I'm throwing it, of course.

737
00:23:39,656 --> 00:23:42,325
3. 3. It's a 3.

738
00:23:42,326 --> 00:23:44,335
1. 1. 3. 3.

739
00:23:45,995 --> 00:23:49,635
(What will it be?)

740
00:23:49,636 --> 00:23:50,795
3. 3.

741
00:23:50,796 --> 00:23:52,004
- 3. - 60 dollars!

742
00:23:52,005 --> 00:23:55,096
(Jae Seok gets 60 dollars.)

743
00:23:55,735 --> 00:23:56,734
(I thought I was unlucky.)

744
00:23:56,735 --> 00:23:58,345
- The die hit something. - 60 dollars.

745
00:23:58,346 --> 00:24:00,447
- He got a six. - I know.

746
00:24:00,546 --> 00:24:02,375
Hold on. Who said it was your turn?

747
00:24:02,376 --> 00:24:04,174
(Haha picks on him.)

748
00:24:04,175 --> 00:24:06,014
- No one. - You're right.

749
00:24:06,015 --> 00:24:08,145
(No one chose him to go next.)

750
00:24:08,146 --> 00:24:09,254
- Wait. - No one.

751
00:24:09,255 --> 00:24:10,885
- No one said you could go next. - I volunteered.

752
00:24:10,886 --> 00:24:12,524
- Listen. - I wanted to go next.

753
00:24:12,525 --> 00:24:13,984
- There's an order to this. - Give it to me.

754
00:24:13,985 --> 00:24:15,994
- I really wanted to go next. - I wanted to do it from the start.

755
00:24:15,995 --> 00:24:17,024
- Me too. - Get it from him!

756
00:24:17,025 --> 00:24:18,825
- Get it! - No.

757
00:24:18,826 --> 00:24:20,464
- This doesn't count. - This doesn't.

758
00:24:20,465 --> 00:24:21,795
(They take away the 60 dollars.)

759
00:24:21,796 --> 00:24:22,934
Why did you go first?

760
00:24:22,935 --> 00:24:24,795
- This doesn't count. - Who wants to go next?

761
00:24:24,796 --> 00:24:26,335
They stole the money from me!

762
00:24:26,336 --> 00:24:27,565
- Who wants to go next? - Hey!

763
00:24:27,566 --> 00:24:28,674
Play rock-paper-scissors.

764
00:24:28,675 --> 00:24:30,034
- Let's go this way. - Hold on.

765
00:24:30,035 --> 00:24:31,204
- We should do that. - Ji Hyo.

766
00:24:31,205 --> 00:24:33,286
- Haha. - I'm flabbergasted.

767
00:24:33,346 --> 00:24:34,702
- Okay. - Yes.

768
00:24:35,046 --> 00:24:37,375
- Okay. - I'm very thankful...

769
00:24:37,376 --> 00:24:38,585
that Jong Kook didn't get involved.

770
00:24:38,586 --> 00:24:41,345
You know I don't like unnatural things.

771
00:24:41,346 --> 00:24:43,048
(He's firm in his preference.)

772
00:24:43,856 --> 00:24:46,085
I don't care if he gets 60 dollars.

773
00:24:46,086 --> 00:24:47,788
- Here we go. - Okay.

774
00:24:47,925 --> 00:24:49,994
3. 3. What was that? 3.

775
00:24:49,995 --> 00:24:51,355
- He rolled it. - It's a three.

776
00:24:51,356 --> 00:24:53,295
(He's surprised by this new tactic.)

777
00:24:53,296 --> 00:24:54,622
It's a three.

778
00:24:55,096 --> 00:24:56,194
Okay!

779
00:24:56,195 --> 00:24:58,565
(Haha gets a 5.)

780
00:24:58,566 --> 00:25:01,288
- Okay! - You shouldn't have rolled it.

781
00:25:01,705 --> 00:25:03,004
- You shouldn't have rolled it. - You should've tossed it.

782
00:25:03,005 --> 00:25:04,004
You shouldn't have rolled it.

783
00:25:04,005 --> 00:25:06,964
Didn't you learn anything from what Seok Jin did?

784
00:25:07,406 --> 00:25:08,615
- Gosh. - I'm not supposed...

785
00:25:08,616 --> 00:25:10,774
- to roll a die? - You should toss it.

786
00:25:10,775 --> 00:25:12,714
Isn't the phrase, "roll a die"?

787
00:25:12,715 --> 00:25:14,184
You should toss it.

788
00:25:14,185 --> 00:25:15,315
My gosh.

789
00:25:15,316 --> 00:25:16,315
Be thankful you're not eliminated.

790
00:25:16,316 --> 00:25:17,815
It's "toss a die"?

791
00:25:17,816 --> 00:25:21,018
Who rolls a die? You toss it.

792
00:25:21,796 --> 00:25:24,224
(He's flabbergasted.)

793
00:25:24,225 --> 00:25:26,524
I thought you didn't like anything unnatural?

794
00:25:26,525 --> 00:25:27,625
- Listen. - No, no.

795
00:25:27,626 --> 00:25:29,295
- That's what he said. - This is right

796
00:25:29,296 --> 00:25:30,994
- You don't roll a die. - You do roll...

797
00:25:30,995 --> 00:25:32,434
- a die. Fine. - You toss a die.

798
00:25:32,435 --> 00:25:33,665
- I'll go again later. - You toss it.

799
00:25:33,666 --> 00:25:35,674
- Who's next? - Do I toss it like this?

800
00:25:35,675 --> 00:25:37,375
- Yes. - Upwards, right?

801
00:25:37,376 --> 00:25:38,405
Don't toss it too high.

802
00:25:38,406 --> 00:25:40,140
- Yes. That was perfect. - That's good.

803
00:25:40,445 --> 00:25:42,863
Please make it be a 3.

804
00:25:43,076 --> 00:25:45,085
- It's a three. - No, no.

805
00:25:45,086 --> 00:25:46,184
This is a three.

806
00:25:46,185 --> 00:25:47,415
- No, no. Please no. - It's rolling for so long.

807
00:25:47,416 --> 00:25:48,415
- This is a three. - What?

808
00:25:48,416 --> 00:25:49,754
- What? - When will it stop?

809
00:25:49,755 --> 00:25:52,949
(What is the number?)

810
00:25:54,656 --> 00:25:57,716
(After rolling for a long time, it stops at a 1.)

811
00:25:58,396 --> 00:26:00,334
(Why did it have to be a 1?)

812
00:26:01,195 --> 00:26:02,828
Gosh, that was nerve-racking.

813
00:26:03,465 --> 00:26:04,795
It's not a big difference with mine.

814
00:26:04,796 --> 00:26:05,835
Be serious this time.

815
00:26:05,836 --> 00:26:07,263
I'll go next.

816
00:26:07,636 --> 00:26:09,981
Toss the die!

817
00:26:10,576 --> 00:26:12,482
I'll toss it. Here I go!

818
00:26:12,705 --> 00:26:14,816
(He tosses it like he's supposed to.)

819
00:26:15,975 --> 00:26:20,315
(Will he be able to get a 6 like he did before?)

820
00:26:20,316 --> 00:26:23,376
(He gets a 1.)

821
00:26:24,015 --> 00:26:25,984
(Everyone is happy.)

822
00:26:25,985 --> 00:26:28,325
I no longer feel lonely!

823
00:26:28,326 --> 00:26:30,224
- Nice. - It could've been better...

824
00:26:30,225 --> 00:26:31,655
to just ask for 30 dollars.

825
00:26:31,656 --> 00:26:32,665
You're right.

826
00:26:32,666 --> 00:26:34,910
- 30 dollars is better. - I know.

827
00:26:35,235 --> 00:26:37,174
- Here. - Me?

828
00:26:37,336 --> 00:26:39,534
- Toss the die! - Toss the die!

829
00:26:39,535 --> 00:26:40,555
(Toss it, don't roll it.)

830
00:26:41,636 --> 00:26:43,573
(Knowing that she's lucky, she decides to do it.)

831
00:26:43,935 --> 00:26:45,578
It rolls a lot.

832
00:26:45,975 --> 00:26:47,645
(Will her luckiness work its charm this time as well?)

833
00:26:47,646 --> 00:26:49,411
(No way!)

834
00:26:50,346 --> 00:26:53,615
(What did she get?)

835
00:26:53,616 --> 00:26:55,415
- 1, please. - 1!

836
00:26:55,416 --> 00:26:57,496
(Ji Hyo also gets a 1.)

837
00:26:58,086 --> 00:26:59,513
- Everyone's getting a 1. - I know.

838
00:26:59,725 --> 00:27:02,378
What's going on? How is this possible?

839
00:27:02,425 --> 00:27:05,194
- Okay. - It's either 1 or 0.

840
00:27:05,195 --> 00:27:06,565
(Se Chan is the only one without any money.)

841
00:27:06,566 --> 00:27:08,934
But you see, it's about time for a 4, 5, or 6.

842
00:27:08,935 --> 00:27:11,095
- Right. - It's about time.

843
00:27:11,096 --> 00:27:13,207
We've had five 1s so far.

844
00:27:13,235 --> 00:27:15,004
- Right? - Just throw it.

845
00:27:15,005 --> 00:27:16,805
- Throw it. - If he opts for receiving...

846
00:27:16,806 --> 00:27:18,474
three dollars, then he's really greedy...

847
00:27:18,475 --> 00:27:20,145
- about money. - Okay.

848
00:27:20,146 --> 00:27:22,014
- Let's go. - I'm not greedy about money.

849
00:27:22,015 --> 00:27:23,615
- Okay, okay. - I'm going to toss it.

850
00:27:23,616 --> 00:27:24,645
Just toss it so you won't look like a Greedy Millipede.

851
00:27:24,646 --> 00:27:26,415
That's not why, but I'll toss it.

852
00:27:26,416 --> 00:27:27,545
- I'm tossing it. - You should.

853
00:27:27,546 --> 00:27:28,885
- Let's go. - Okay.

854
00:27:28,886 --> 00:27:30,211
Good. He's really tossing it.

855
00:27:31,015 --> 00:27:32,790
I should be getting a four.

856
00:27:33,556 --> 00:27:34,555
It's too low.

857
00:27:34,556 --> 00:27:35,555
(The Greedy Millipede...)

858
00:27:35,556 --> 00:27:36,555
(makes a timid toss.)

859
00:27:36,556 --> 00:27:39,963
I'm not alone. I'm not alone.

860
00:27:40,025 --> 00:27:41,249
Okay!

861
00:27:41,265 --> 00:27:43,683
(He gets a 3.)

862
00:27:43,896 --> 00:27:46,385
- Okay! - Okay!

863
00:27:46,465 --> 00:27:48,635
Okay, Jae Seok!

864
00:27:48,636 --> 00:27:49,829
- That's amazing. - I'm not alone.

865
00:27:49,836 --> 00:27:50,835
I'm not alone.

866
00:27:50,836 --> 00:27:52,375
It's just like him to get that. It's fascinating.

867
00:27:52,376 --> 00:27:53,645
Gosh, Kwang Soo.

868
00:27:53,646 --> 00:27:55,244
- He got a three. - How is this possible?

869
00:27:55,245 --> 00:27:57,014
Everyone else will get a 4, 5, or 6.

870
00:27:57,015 --> 00:27:58,014
- Okay! - This is unbelievable.

871
00:27:58,015 --> 00:28:00,145
Jong Kook. Jong Kook.

872
00:28:00,146 --> 00:28:01,214
- I'd like 30 dollars. - What?

873
00:28:01,215 --> 00:28:03,561
(He doesn't hesitate.)

874
00:28:03,755 --> 00:28:05,724
- What is this? - He didn't toss it?

875
00:28:05,725 --> 00:28:07,284
- What are you doing? - What is this?

876
00:28:07,285 --> 00:28:08,347
Okay!

877
00:28:08,796 --> 00:28:10,153
What is this?

878
00:28:11,025 --> 00:28:12,295
(Haha suddenly barges in.)

879
00:28:12,296 --> 00:28:14,464
- Hey, Haha. - I'd like 30 dollars too.

880
00:28:14,465 --> 00:28:15,734
(You can't do that.)

881
00:28:15,735 --> 00:28:17,234
- What are you doing? - You can't do that.

882
00:28:17,235 --> 00:28:18,665
- You already tossed it once. - You can't do that.

883
00:28:18,666 --> 00:28:20,105
- You already did it. - You did it.

884
00:28:20,106 --> 00:28:21,365
- You did it once. - Why can't I get 30 dollars?

885
00:28:21,366 --> 00:28:23,034
- You already did it. - You did it once.

886
00:28:23,035 --> 00:28:25,645
They can't do this to Jong Kook, so they're doing this to me!

887
00:28:25,646 --> 00:28:27,411
- You can't do that. - You've already done it once.

888
00:28:27,975 --> 00:28:28,974
Is there such a rule?

889
00:28:28,975 --> 00:28:31,075
You already tossed it once.

890
00:28:31,076 --> 00:28:33,915
- Jong Kook didn't start at all. - I didn't start, but you did.

891
00:28:33,916 --> 00:28:34,915
I thought you hated anything unnatural.

892
00:28:34,916 --> 00:28:36,184
This isn't unnatural.

893
00:28:36,185 --> 00:28:38,085
- Is there such a rule? - I didn't toss the die at all.

894
00:28:38,086 --> 00:28:39,625
- But you did. - So is there a rule?

895
00:28:39,626 --> 00:28:41,284
- Of course. - Okay.

896
00:28:41,285 --> 00:28:42,857
Sit down.

897
00:28:42,925 --> 00:28:43,945
Okay.

898
00:28:44,495 --> 00:28:46,363
- Toss the die! - Toss the die!

899
00:28:46,926 --> 00:28:49,445
- Can he use just one hand? - Of course.

901
00:28:55,836 --> 00:28:59,007
(He gets a 1.)

902
00:28:59,975 --> 00:29:01,026
Darn it!

903
00:29:01,376 --> 00:29:03,110
(He throws a fit.)

904
00:29:03,646 --> 00:29:05,645
(How could I get a 1?)

905
00:29:05,646 --> 00:29:07,415
- This is so irritating. - Wait.

906
00:29:07,416 --> 00:29:08,655
(Jong Kook is happy with this natural outcome.)

907
00:29:08,656 --> 00:29:10,714
- I'm so vexed. - Just laugh it off.

908
00:29:10,715 --> 00:29:12,024
- At least you got a 1. - I feel irritated.

909
00:29:12,025 --> 00:29:13,413
You at least got 10 dollars.

910
00:29:13,626 --> 00:29:14,951
- You should be grateful. - All right.

911
00:29:15,025 --> 00:29:16,655
Now, we will start the race. Like I said,

912
00:29:16,656 --> 00:29:18,395
- it's two members per team. - Okay.

913
00:29:18,396 --> 00:29:20,524
- You will pick out spoons. - Your teammate is important.

914
00:29:20,525 --> 00:29:21,994
Two members will become a team.

915
00:29:21,995 --> 00:29:23,534
- We should team up with Jong Kook. - We should.

916
00:29:23,535 --> 00:29:24,565
- We should. - Okay.

917
00:29:24,566 --> 00:29:26,402
- We have to team up with him. - Okay, it's Jong Kook.

918
00:29:26,435 --> 00:29:27,805
You and I have to split up.

919
00:29:27,806 --> 00:29:29,835
- We need to split up. - Or we're doomed.

920
00:29:29,836 --> 00:29:31,202
All right, Seok Jin.

921
00:29:32,005 --> 00:29:33,638
- It's matching colors, right? - Yes.

922
00:29:33,975 --> 00:29:36,014
It's the same color. All right.

923
00:29:36,015 --> 00:29:37,075
(Jong Kook picks out his spoon.)

924
00:29:37,076 --> 00:29:38,615
- Okay. - I'm done.

925
00:29:38,616 --> 00:29:39,915
Let's start with Seok Jin.

926
00:29:39,916 --> 00:29:41,415
(Members with the same color will become a team.)

927
00:29:41,816 --> 00:29:43,254
- Red. - Red.

928
00:29:43,255 --> 00:29:44,615
(Seok Jin's spoon is red.)

929
00:29:44,616 --> 00:29:46,224
- Jong Kook. - I hope it's not red.

930
00:29:46,225 --> 00:29:47,655
- Is it red? - It is.

931
00:29:47,656 --> 00:29:50,786
(Jong Kook's spoon is red.)

932
00:29:51,396 --> 00:29:52,424
What?

933
00:29:52,425 --> 00:29:54,125
(Jong Kook is teamed up with Seok Jin.)

934
00:29:54,126 --> 00:29:56,032
- Oh, no. - We're a team!

935
00:29:56,596 --> 00:29:57,665
Seriously.

936
00:29:57,666 --> 00:29:58,665
We needed him.

937
00:29:58,666 --> 00:30:00,335
- He was our last hope. - This is driving me crazy.

938
00:30:00,336 --> 00:30:01,835
But still...

939
00:30:01,836 --> 00:30:03,204
What color is yours?

940
00:30:03,205 --> 00:30:04,434
(Ji Hyo's spoon is...)

941
00:30:04,435 --> 00:30:06,925
- Blue. - Blue. Let's go this way.

942
00:30:07,205 --> 00:30:08,909
- This is important. - Don't pick blue.

943
00:30:08,975 --> 00:30:10,709
- All right. - 1, 2, 3.

944
00:30:10,916 --> 00:30:12,385
- It's green. - It's green?

945
00:30:12,386 --> 00:30:14,079
- Kwang Soo shouldn't pick green. - So Min.

946
00:30:15,656 --> 00:30:17,552
- They have no money. - Okay, show us.

947
00:30:17,656 --> 00:30:18,885
- 1, 2, 3. - What is it?

948
00:30:18,886 --> 00:30:20,355
- It's yellow. - Hold on.

949
00:30:20,356 --> 00:30:21,424
- Then what about you? - Those two are...

950
00:30:21,425 --> 00:30:23,639
- No! Not Kwang Soo! - No!

951
00:30:24,096 --> 00:30:25,424
- Goodness. - Oh, no.

952
00:30:25,425 --> 00:30:26,691
This will be fun.

953
00:30:27,096 --> 00:30:29,074
All right. Let's see.

954
00:30:29,235 --> 00:30:30,317
1, 2, 3.

955
00:30:31,695 --> 00:30:35,654
(Will he successfully avoid Se Chan who has no money?)

956
00:30:36,435 --> 00:30:37,805
(Haha's spoon is...)

957
00:30:37,806 --> 00:30:39,375
- Green. All right. - Okay!

958
00:30:39,376 --> 00:30:41,242
Okay! 10 dollars! Okay!

959
00:30:41,876 --> 00:30:42,915
Ant-Man!

960
00:30:42,916 --> 00:30:44,854
- Now... - Thank you so much.

961
00:30:45,245 --> 00:30:47,764
- Ji Hyo hasn't been teamed up yet. - Neither did So Min.

962
00:30:47,916 --> 00:30:49,454
- Ji Hyo and So Min. - I just...

963
00:30:49,455 --> 00:30:51,394
I just need to avoid zero dollars.

964
00:30:51,616 --> 00:30:53,524
I really want to team up with Jae Seok.

965
00:30:53,525 --> 00:30:55,325
Me too.

966
00:30:55,326 --> 00:30:56,625
- Jae Seok. - I want to team up with him.

967
00:30:56,626 --> 00:30:58,461
- Please. - Step back. One.

968
00:30:58,525 --> 00:31:01,165
- Kwang Soo, no. - Please, Jae Seok.

969
00:31:01,166 --> 00:31:02,696
1, 2, 3.

970
00:31:03,765 --> 00:31:05,165
(Jae Seok and Kwang Soo's spoons are...)

971
00:31:05,166 --> 00:31:06,565
(blue and yellow, respectively.)

972
00:31:06,566 --> 00:31:08,565
- Ji Hyo. Three. - What is this?

973
00:31:08,566 --> 00:31:11,084
(She's relieved that it's not Kwang Soo.)

974
00:31:11,636 --> 00:31:13,075
(I can't believe I'm partnered up with the Greedy Millipede.)

975
00:31:13,076 --> 00:31:14,371
Goodness, this is it.

976
00:31:15,175 --> 00:31:16,274
You got 10 dollars, So Min.

977
00:31:16,275 --> 00:31:18,835
- Okay. - We have 40 dollars.

978
00:31:19,185 --> 00:31:21,284
I know we have 40 dollars, but let's be clear.

979
00:31:21,285 --> 00:31:22,815
30 dollars is mine.

980
00:31:23,356 --> 00:31:24,815
- Hey, we're a team. - You know that, right?

981
00:31:24,816 --> 00:31:26,927
- I have 30, and you have 10. - We're a team.

982
00:31:28,185 --> 00:31:29,924
It's 20 dollars and 40 dollars.

983
00:31:29,925 --> 00:31:31,454
It's a 10-dollar difference.

984
00:31:31,455 --> 00:31:34,665
Shouldn't you help us out a little?

985
00:31:34,666 --> 00:31:36,895
- This is too little. - We have 10 dollars in total.

986
00:31:36,896 --> 00:31:40,201
Then you should've made a wiser decision.

987
00:31:40,566 --> 00:31:41,734
(They have nothing to say.)

988
00:31:41,735 --> 00:31:43,878
- He's right. - He's totally right.

989
00:31:43,935 --> 00:31:45,744
Take one each.

990
00:31:45,745 --> 00:31:46,944
- "Team's Land Price"? - "Team's Land Price"?

991
00:31:46,945 --> 00:31:48,444
- "Team's Land Price"? - What is this?

992
00:31:48,445 --> 00:31:49,639
(What could this be?)

993
00:31:49,816 --> 00:31:52,714
For today's Burdensome Race, you need to pick...

994
00:31:52,715 --> 00:31:55,415
- the right land to win. - Really?

995
00:31:55,416 --> 00:31:56,710
Your decision is what counts.

996
00:31:56,785 --> 00:31:59,184
Each team is given two pieces of land each...

997
00:31:59,185 --> 00:32:01,254
of 10, 20, and 30 dollars.

998
00:32:01,255 --> 00:32:03,325
You can freely place the 7 gold bars and 2 duds...

999
00:32:03,326 --> 00:32:05,845
on that board.

1000
00:32:05,925 --> 00:32:07,165
After every round,

1001
00:32:07,166 --> 00:32:08,895
the winning team can see two of the opposing team's.

1002
00:32:08,896 --> 00:32:11,135
The second place team can open one of them.

1003
00:32:11,136 --> 00:32:13,481
If you pay the price and purchase their land,

1004
00:32:14,005 --> 00:32:17,034
you will acquire their gold bars.

1005
00:32:17,235 --> 00:32:18,944
However, if you choose a dud,

1006
00:32:18,945 --> 00:32:21,805
you will have to hand over one of your gold bars to them.

1007
00:32:21,806 --> 00:32:23,545
(They need to pay them.)

1008
00:32:23,546 --> 00:32:24,545
- We should allocate them well. - It is of the utmost importance...

1009
00:32:24,546 --> 00:32:26,145
- where you put them. - You're right.

1010
00:32:26,146 --> 00:32:28,514
1 gold bar is worth 50 dollars.

1011
00:32:28,515 --> 00:32:30,815
- 50 dollars? - The value is high.

1012
00:32:30,816 --> 00:32:35,243
After the final mission, the team with the most R Money will win.

1013
00:32:35,386 --> 00:32:38,109
All teams will get 2 of each, 1 gold bar for 1 person.

1014
00:32:38,195 --> 00:32:40,409
- That's great. - We have money.

1015
00:32:40,525 --> 00:32:41,821
That is money.

1016
00:32:42,096 --> 00:32:43,835
- No, wait up. - What?

1017
00:32:43,836 --> 00:32:45,395
- We're on the same team. - I know that.

1018
00:32:45,396 --> 00:32:46,534
Come on!

1019
00:32:46,535 --> 00:32:47,805
(He explodes.)

1020
00:32:47,806 --> 00:32:48,905
I'm sick of this. Wait.

1021
00:32:48,906 --> 00:32:51,075
- We're on the same team! - I know that, so let me hold them.

1022
00:32:51,076 --> 00:32:53,422
It's exhausting to be on a team with So Min.

1023
00:32:53,445 --> 00:32:55,744
- You can have one each. - You can have one each.

1024
00:32:55,745 --> 00:32:57,306
Let's do rock-paper-scissors. Rock-paper-scissors.

1025
00:32:57,715 --> 00:32:58,774
(Kwang Soo wins.)

1026
00:32:58,775 --> 00:32:59,805
Okay.

1027
00:33:00,015 --> 00:33:01,415
What?

1028
00:33:01,416 --> 00:33:03,555
You have to spend your energy somewhere else other than games...

1029
00:33:03,556 --> 00:33:05,184
when you play with So Min.

1030
00:33:05,185 --> 00:33:06,784
He took it without even asking me.

1031
00:33:06,785 --> 00:33:08,684
Stop it! I was talking to myself.

1032
00:33:08,685 --> 00:33:09,724
(Jae Seok explodes too.)

1033
00:33:09,725 --> 00:33:11,185
Come on now.

1034
00:33:11,656 --> 00:33:13,494
Each team can discuss now,

1035
00:33:13,495 --> 00:33:15,300
- and place them cautiously. - Okay.

1036
00:33:15,666 --> 00:33:16,921
This is crazy.

1037
00:33:16,995 --> 00:33:18,290
Where should I put them?

1038
00:33:18,296 --> 00:33:21,905
So we have to anticipate where they will ask us to open,

1039
00:33:21,906 --> 00:33:24,075
and put duds in there.

1040
00:33:24,076 --> 00:33:25,402
You choose.

1041
00:33:26,205 --> 00:33:28,593
- First, 20 dollars. - 20 dollars.

1042
00:33:29,076 --> 00:33:30,444
(She places 1 gold bar on the 20-dollar land.)

1043
00:33:30,445 --> 00:33:32,045
This is where they won't open.

1044
00:33:32,046 --> 00:33:33,107
- What if we... - Or...

1045
00:33:33,886 --> 00:33:36,467
why don't we put 2 duds on the 30-dollar land?

1046
00:33:36,556 --> 00:33:38,728
They won't expect us to put both of them on here.

1047
00:33:38,785 --> 00:33:40,081
- Right. - Right?

1048
00:33:40,485 --> 00:33:42,434
But putting them in one place is dangerous.

1049
00:33:42,725 --> 00:33:44,155
You are a risk-taker.

1050
00:33:44,156 --> 00:33:46,441
- Let's put them in one place. - No.

1051
00:33:46,465 --> 00:33:47,694
Ji Hyo, let's put them together.

1052
00:33:47,695 --> 00:33:49,165
- You already know... - It's dangerous.

1053
00:33:49,166 --> 00:33:51,001
how good it feels when they pick an empty one.

1054
00:33:51,435 --> 00:33:53,067
- Don't you? - It's too dangerous.

1055
00:33:53,205 --> 00:33:54,464
- Let's do it. - Jae Seok.

1056
00:33:54,465 --> 00:33:55,904
- How about we put all of them here? - No.

1057
00:33:56,035 --> 00:33:58,474
I was afraid you might do that.

1058
00:33:58,475 --> 00:34:00,145
- I feel suffocated now. - No.

1059
00:34:00,146 --> 00:34:01,774
- It gives me stress... - No.

1060
00:34:01,775 --> 00:34:03,214
- just thinking about these. - No.

1061
00:34:03,215 --> 00:34:05,375
No, Jae Seok. Just hold on.

1062
00:34:05,376 --> 00:34:06,615
Ji Hyo, listen to me.

1063
00:34:06,616 --> 00:34:08,384
(They relocate the gold bars and duds...)

1064
00:34:08,385 --> 00:34:10,154
(thanks to Ji Hyo's rationality.)

1065
00:34:10,155 --> 00:34:11,441
It'll be hit or miss.

1066
00:34:12,015 --> 00:34:13,791
- How about one for each? - How about...

1067
00:34:14,055 --> 00:34:15,154
No.

1068
00:34:15,155 --> 00:34:16,348
Why don't we divide them by 6 and 1 gold bars?

1069
00:34:16,426 --> 00:34:18,058
6 and 1? Okay.

1070
00:34:18,296 --> 00:34:19,551
But don't you think it's risky?

1071
00:34:19,626 --> 00:34:21,605
5 and 2 sounds safer.

1072
00:34:21,666 --> 00:34:22,864
That sounds safer?

1073
00:34:22,865 --> 00:34:24,195
(It's not that safe.)

1074
00:34:24,196 --> 00:34:26,144
It's safer than 6 and 1.

1075
00:34:26,506 --> 00:34:27,526
So 6 and 1.

1076
00:34:27,566 --> 00:34:29,434
- 1 for number 2? - 1 for number 2.

1077
00:34:29,435 --> 00:34:30,496
(They put six gold bars in one place.)

1078
00:34:30,676 --> 00:34:31,726
And then what?

1079
00:34:32,075 --> 00:34:33,574
- How about number 4? - 20 dollars in number 4?

1080
00:34:33,575 --> 00:34:35,340
(They're thinking about where to put the rest 6.)

1081
00:34:36,176 --> 00:34:37,400
- How about here? - Good.

1082
00:34:38,276 --> 00:34:39,445
Isn't this too dangerous?

1083
00:34:39,446 --> 00:34:40,609
(It is a bit risky.)

1084
00:34:40,716 --> 00:34:42,113
Should we put just five of them?

1085
00:34:43,356 --> 00:34:46,355
- Should we put all of them here? - Yes. Let's do it.

1086
00:34:46,356 --> 00:34:48,324
(Kwang Soo is more of a risk-taker.)

1087
00:34:48,325 --> 00:34:49,478
If a team chooses that, they'll win.

1088
00:34:50,155 --> 00:34:51,494
If a team chooses that, they'll win.

1089
00:34:51,495 --> 00:34:52,617
What should we do?

1090
00:34:52,865 --> 00:34:53,895
Take them apart.

1091
00:34:53,896 --> 00:34:55,732
(Let's take them apart.)

1092
00:34:56,435 --> 00:34:57,864
We were being hasty. I'm sorry.

1093
00:34:57,865 --> 00:34:58,965
(His timidness surpassed his character of risk-taker.)

1094
00:34:58,966 --> 00:35:00,700
I don't know anymore.

1095
00:35:01,635 --> 00:35:02,799
You choose yourself.

1096
00:35:03,276 --> 00:35:04,806
Are they reflected on that car?

1097
00:35:05,336 --> 00:35:06,904
Something is reflected on it.

1098
00:35:06,905 --> 00:35:07,974
(You can barely see them.)

1099
00:35:07,975 --> 00:35:09,014
Right.

1100
00:35:09,015 --> 00:35:10,114
(Why are they watching at us right now?)

1101
00:35:10,115 --> 00:35:11,114
Wait.

1102
00:35:11,115 --> 00:35:13,244
(They cover with their bodies after noticing.)

1103
00:35:13,245 --> 00:35:15,021
Are you allowed to peek through the reflection?

1104
00:35:15,416 --> 00:35:17,114
- I wasn't trying to peek, - Isn't that cheating?

1105
00:35:17,115 --> 00:35:18,920
it just showed up on me.

1106
00:35:18,955 --> 00:35:20,109
Jae Seok.

1107
00:35:20,285 --> 00:35:21,755
Ji Hyo's eyes are so clear...

1108
00:35:21,756 --> 00:35:23,225
that we can see yours through the reflection in her eyes.

1109
00:35:23,856 --> 00:35:25,181
She likes it.

1110
00:35:25,796 --> 00:35:26,864
So Min.

1111
00:35:26,865 --> 00:35:29,465
Your skin is so transparent that yours is reflecting on it.

1112
00:35:29,466 --> 00:35:30,588
No.

1113
00:35:30,836 --> 00:35:32,034
- Kwang Soo. - Yes?

1114
00:35:32,035 --> 00:35:33,934
I can't see anything because your eyes seem muddy.

1115
00:35:33,935 --> 00:35:35,230
(I can't see anything because your eyes seem muddy.)

1116
00:35:35,466 --> 00:35:37,576
(Suppressing anger)

1117
00:35:37,776 --> 00:35:39,505
How about this?

1118
00:35:39,506 --> 00:35:41,280
I'll shake my hand up and down and you say, "Stop!"

1119
00:35:41,876 --> 00:35:43,140
What do you think?

1120
00:35:43,176 --> 00:35:44,875
Because when you're confused...

1121
00:35:44,876 --> 00:35:46,684
- Okay, I won't look. - Yes, don't look.

1122
00:35:46,685 --> 00:35:47,744
That's a simple strategy.

1123
00:35:47,745 --> 00:35:48,837
Say, "Stop."

1124
00:35:49,086 --> 00:35:50,855
(It's a manual system.)

1125
00:35:50,856 --> 00:35:52,181
- Stop. - Haha.

1126
00:35:52,216 --> 00:35:53,985
That's awesome. Let's put one here.

1127
00:35:53,986 --> 00:35:55,076
Yes.

1128
00:35:55,126 --> 00:35:56,584
I like it because it's simple.

1129
00:35:57,155 --> 00:35:58,554
Let's put ourselves in their shoes.

1130
00:35:58,555 --> 00:35:59,748
Let's say we choose another team's number.

1131
00:36:00,396 --> 00:36:02,835
Shouldn't we put a dud in the 10-dollar land?

1132
00:36:02,836 --> 00:36:04,804
If they open a dud with 10 dollars,

1133
00:36:04,896 --> 00:36:07,385
they have to give us a gold bar.

1134
00:36:07,666 --> 00:36:10,134
- Okay, let's do that. - Yes.

1135
00:36:10,135 --> 00:36:11,875
Because 10 dollars...

1136
00:36:11,876 --> 00:36:13,844
- is nothing. - It's nothing.

1137
00:36:14,205 --> 00:36:15,500
There's no pressure in choosing it.

1138
00:36:16,276 --> 00:36:17,366
Good.

1139
00:36:17,876 --> 00:36:19,823
Where should we put this dud?

1140
00:36:20,885 --> 00:36:22,211
How about the 20 dollar-land?

1141
00:36:22,245 --> 00:36:25,172
I think the 30-dollar land is the better choice.

1142
00:36:25,185 --> 00:36:26,889
Right.

1143
00:36:27,126 --> 00:36:28,925
If they pay 30 dollars, they have a better chance...

1144
00:36:28,926 --> 00:36:30,855
- of choosing number 6. - Right. Number 6.

1145
00:36:30,856 --> 00:36:33,722
- They would choose number 6. - Yes, number 6.

1146
00:36:34,196 --> 00:36:35,735
If they...

1147
00:36:35,736 --> 00:36:37,634
(He dropped a gold bar sticker while he was talking.)

1148
00:36:37,635 --> 00:36:39,235
Are you going to keep dropping these gold bars?

1149
00:36:39,236 --> 00:36:40,605
(Stop being so clumsy.)

1150
00:36:40,606 --> 00:36:41,665
- Hey. - What?

1151
00:36:41,666 --> 00:36:42,675
Hold on to them.

1152
00:36:42,676 --> 00:36:44,634
You're younger than me, why am I doing all the work?

1153
00:36:44,635 --> 00:36:45,844
I'm holding these.

1154
00:36:45,845 --> 00:36:47,172
- Why am I... - Hold on to it.

1155
00:36:47,475 --> 00:36:49,210
(He's very docile.)

1156
00:36:49,546 --> 00:36:50,875
- We're good. - We're good.

1157
00:36:50,876 --> 00:36:52,045
(It feels like it should be the other way around.)

1158
00:36:52,046 --> 00:36:53,445
Placement is finished.

1159
00:36:53,446 --> 00:36:54,585
Okay.

1160
00:36:54,586 --> 00:36:57,154
- We just don't have to be the last. - Right.

1161
00:36:57,155 --> 00:36:58,884
We just have to avoid being drawn on the bottom part.

1162
00:36:58,885 --> 00:37:00,855
I watched you before,

1163
00:37:00,856 --> 00:37:02,594
and you were doing everything Jong Kook told you to.

1164
00:37:02,595 --> 00:37:05,054
- That's not true. - He suggested some ideas.

1165
00:37:05,055 --> 00:37:07,239
Seok Jin looked like a parrot on Jong Kook's shoulder.

1166
00:37:07,566 --> 00:37:09,636
- That's not true. - You were just copying him.

1167
00:37:09,666 --> 00:37:11,764
- He's like a little brother to me. - You were talking a lot.

1168
00:37:11,765 --> 00:37:13,234
I was leading this team.

1169
00:37:14,255 --> 00:37:15,438
I'm planning to.

1170
00:37:16,326 --> 00:37:17,785
(We'll see, Seok Jin.)

1171
00:37:17,786 --> 00:37:20,142
I'll let him lead our team,

1172
00:37:20,196 --> 00:37:21,726
- and hold him responsible later. - Sure.

1173
00:37:21,895 --> 00:37:23,700
- That's better. - That sounds scary.

1174
00:37:23,966 --> 00:37:25,695
- That sounds scarier. - It's better that way.

1175
00:37:25,696 --> 00:37:27,368
- All teams can set off now. - Let's go.

1176
00:37:27,466 --> 00:37:29,434
- Should we sit by teams? - Yes, we should.

1177
00:37:29,435 --> 00:37:30,628
(Let's go start the mission.)

1178
00:37:31,306 --> 00:37:32,675
Can I ask you something?

1179
00:37:32,676 --> 00:37:34,368
Did anyone put everything in one place?

1180
00:37:34,605 --> 00:37:36,305
- Anyone? - You can't do it that way.

1181
00:37:36,306 --> 00:37:37,445
- I would never do that. - Who would do that?

1182
00:37:37,446 --> 00:37:40,115
- You did, didn't you? - Right. You put them in one place.

1183
00:37:40,116 --> 00:37:41,115
- Okay. - They took the bait.

1184
00:37:41,116 --> 00:37:42,544
I think...

1185
00:37:42,545 --> 00:37:44,555
Kwang Soo and So Min put everything in one place.

1186
00:37:45,045 --> 00:37:46,684
No, because our goal...

1187
00:37:46,685 --> 00:37:49,205
- was to avoid being the last. - That was our goal.

1188
00:37:49,226 --> 00:37:52,244
I think they put everything in number one.

1189
00:37:52,455 --> 00:37:56,124
(Coughing)

1190
00:37:56,125 --> 00:37:57,325
(The moment he mentioned number 1,)

1191
00:37:57,326 --> 00:37:58,564
(she started coughing.)

1192
00:37:58,565 --> 00:38:00,294
- Wait. - Why are you coughing?

1193
00:38:00,295 --> 00:38:01,794
- This is bad timing. - I'm not...

1194
00:38:01,795 --> 00:38:03,204
- What's going on? - It's nothing.

1195
00:38:03,205 --> 00:38:04,265
Why are you coughing now?

1196
00:38:04,266 --> 00:38:06,475
- It's either number 1 or 2. - Right.

1197
00:38:06,476 --> 00:38:08,234
They're flustered.

1198
00:38:08,235 --> 00:38:09,445
(Did they really put the gold bars in one place?)

1199
00:38:09,446 --> 00:38:10,604
It's just a slight cold.

1200
00:38:10,605 --> 00:38:13,475
Ji Hyo's face is actually smaller than So Min's.

1201
00:38:13,476 --> 00:38:18,885
(He suddenly talks about the fact about their faces.)

1202
00:38:18,886 --> 00:38:20,254
(And So Min tries to make her face look smaller.)

1203
00:38:20,255 --> 00:38:21,584
So Min is sitting closer to you.

1204
00:38:21,585 --> 00:38:24,207
Right. That would be the reason.

1205
00:38:24,556 --> 00:38:27,921
Seok Jin, your face looks way smaller than Kwang Soo's.

1206
00:38:27,955 --> 00:38:29,055
I do have a small face.

1207
00:38:29,056 --> 00:38:30,861
It's the size of an idol star.

1208
00:38:30,895 --> 00:38:32,253
Is your face as small as an idol star's?

1209
00:38:32,596 --> 00:38:34,865
- The style of an idol star? - No, an idol's look.

1210
00:38:34,866 --> 00:38:36,437
I have an idol's look.

1211
00:38:36,505 --> 00:38:37,734
Looks like you'll be dead soon.

1212
00:38:37,735 --> 00:38:39,635
(He puts an end to Seok Jin's absurd remarks.)

1213
00:38:39,636 --> 00:38:40,704
Jong Kook!

1214
00:38:40,705 --> 00:38:42,133
Hey!

1215
00:38:42,645 --> 00:38:45,808
I'm really going to hurt you soon.

1216
00:38:46,315 --> 00:38:47,570
He has a sad look.

1217
00:38:48,346 --> 00:38:50,253
- Looks like he'll be dead someday. - That sounds better.

1218
00:38:51,915 --> 00:38:53,282
How does that sound better?

1219
00:38:53,315 --> 00:38:55,152
- Still, he omitted "soon". - Seok Jin.

1220
00:38:55,185 --> 00:38:57,825
- Come on. - Hey, you brat.

1221
00:38:57,826 --> 00:38:59,024
How does that sound better?

1222
00:38:59,025 --> 00:39:00,854
You couldn't say anything to Jong Kook,

1223
00:39:00,855 --> 00:39:02,324
- and you're blaming me? - Why are you blaming him?

1224
00:39:02,665 --> 00:39:04,502
- You punk. - He's upset at Jong Kook.

1225
00:39:04,565 --> 00:39:05,994
What did I do?

1226
00:39:06,165 --> 00:39:07,695
(You little...)

1227
00:39:07,696 --> 00:39:09,234
He has anger issues.

1228
00:39:09,235 --> 00:39:11,204
- It's just me. - He has anger issues.

1229
00:39:11,766 --> 00:39:14,152
- Seok Jin. - You two are going to...

1230
00:39:15,335 --> 00:39:17,175
He's flustered.

1231
00:39:17,176 --> 00:39:19,204
You two are going to have juniors one day.

1232
00:39:19,205 --> 00:39:21,082
You have to be strict when you have to.

1233
00:39:21,116 --> 00:39:22,269
I wasn't able to do that.

1234
00:39:22,516 --> 00:39:24,314
- You have to when needed. - Who would you...

1235
00:39:24,315 --> 00:39:25,914
scold in order if you could?

1236
00:39:25,915 --> 00:39:27,242
In the future.

1237
00:39:27,815 --> 00:39:28,876
He's number one.

1238
00:39:29,656 --> 00:39:30,725
- Jae Seok? - Jae Seok?

1239
00:39:30,726 --> 00:39:32,695
- Then he's number two. - Jong Kook?

1240
00:39:32,696 --> 00:39:34,294
Yes, he should be next.

1241
00:39:34,295 --> 00:39:36,095
(Jong Kook is staring at Seok Jin.)

1242
00:39:36,096 --> 00:39:38,095
- And... - Look me in the eye and tell me.

1243
00:39:38,096 --> 00:39:40,834
(Don't be so frightened.)

1244
00:39:40,835 --> 00:39:43,934
I saw that his pupils were trembling.

1245
00:39:43,935 --> 00:39:45,405
(I can't even be in a staring contest against him.)

1246
00:39:45,406 --> 00:39:47,924
It looked like Jong Kook was sitting over here.

1247
00:39:49,205 --> 00:39:50,981
That was a genuine reaction.

1248
00:39:51,076 --> 00:39:52,504
I feel sorry for him.

1249
00:39:53,915 --> 00:39:55,609
What song are we going to choose for the couple's performance?

1250
00:39:56,415 --> 00:39:58,144
- The disco dance? - No.

1251
00:39:58,145 --> 00:39:59,144
(Jae Seok and Haha have to put on a couple performance.)

1252
00:39:59,145 --> 00:40:00,848
Is any kind of music okay?

1253
00:40:00,915 --> 00:40:04,024
And we can either just sing or dance, right?

1254
00:40:04,025 --> 00:40:05,885
- Are we allowed to... - Why don't you two do that?

1255
00:40:05,886 --> 00:40:08,914
get a song composed by a songwriter?

1256
00:40:08,996 --> 00:40:11,168
- That'd be great. - Right.

1257
00:40:11,196 --> 00:40:12,495
That's going to be awesome.

1258
00:40:12,496 --> 00:40:14,765
- Do you want me to write you one? - You?

1259
00:40:14,766 --> 00:40:16,334
- I'll write you one. - Why don't you write some checks?

1260
00:40:16,335 --> 00:40:17,704
(Don't write a song, write a check.)

1261
00:40:17,705 --> 00:40:18,865
- Please. - Hey,

1262
00:40:18,866 --> 00:40:20,232
I'll write you a song.

1263
00:40:20,406 --> 00:40:21,701
He said, "Write a check."

1264
00:40:22,235 --> 00:40:24,388
- I apologize. - I'll write you a song.

1265
00:40:24,645 --> 00:40:26,788
I already have a few songs I wrote.

1266
00:40:26,815 --> 00:40:28,015
- You wrote songs? - Yes.

1267
00:40:28,016 --> 00:40:29,414
(Did I mishear?)

1268
00:40:29,415 --> 00:40:30,745
- Why would you write songs? - Because...

1269
00:40:30,746 --> 00:40:32,245
I thought I'd need them someday.

1270
00:40:32,246 --> 00:40:37,055
They're melodies that came into my head at 2am.

1271
00:40:37,056 --> 00:40:38,483
But you go to bed early.

1272
00:40:38,855 --> 00:40:40,524
- You go to bed early. - You go to bed at 10pm.

1273
00:40:40,525 --> 00:40:42,087
Sometimes I wake up at that time.

1274
00:40:42,196 --> 00:40:43,552
So I wrote them.

1275
00:40:43,625 --> 00:40:44,993
- To go to the bathroom? - Yes.

1276
00:40:45,065 --> 00:40:48,195
Pee goes squirt, squirt Pee goes squirt, squirt

1277
00:40:48,196 --> 00:40:49,592
(Pee goes squirt, squirt Pee goes squirt, squirt)

1278
00:40:49,735 --> 00:40:51,734
(It's a song he wrote when he was going to the bathroom at 2am.)

1279
00:40:51,735 --> 00:40:53,004
I have to pee

1280
00:40:53,005 --> 00:40:54,305
I have to pee

1281
00:40:54,306 --> 00:40:57,144
Fart goes poop, poop Fart goes poop, poop

1282
00:40:57,145 --> 00:40:59,575
You're old enough not to say "Pee goes squirt, squirt."

1283
00:40:59,576 --> 00:41:01,045
Pee goes squirt, squirt

1284
00:41:01,116 --> 00:41:03,258
My prostate, stay healthy

1285
00:41:04,786 --> 00:41:08,081
(Stay healthy, Jae Seok's prostate.)

1286
00:41:08,085 --> 00:41:10,385
Stay healthy all the way

1287
00:41:10,386 --> 00:41:12,084
(The song was written to wish men's prostates to stay healthy.)

1288
00:41:12,085 --> 00:41:14,473
- That was... - "My prostate, stay healthy."

1289
00:41:15,525 --> 00:41:17,739
That was the best one among all the songs you wrote.

1290
00:41:17,966 --> 00:41:19,832
Soft and dry

1291
00:41:19,895 --> 00:41:22,650
- Let's be soft and dry today - Let's be soft and dry today

1292
00:41:22,696 --> 00:41:24,950
Soft and dry

1293
00:41:25,036 --> 00:41:27,381
Let's be soft and dry today

1294
00:41:28,705 --> 00:41:33,115
(He was expressing his wish of not getting wet.)

1295
00:41:33,116 --> 00:41:34,374
It's really addictive.

1296
00:41:34,375 --> 00:41:37,215
- Let's be soft and dry today - Let's be soft and dry today

1297
00:41:37,216 --> 00:41:38,885
I struggled with that song for two months.

1298
00:41:38,886 --> 00:41:39,885
I kept singing it in my head.

1299
00:41:39,886 --> 00:41:41,721
- It should be banned for SAT. - Right.

1300
00:41:41,815 --> 00:41:44,725
I'll come up with a melody with those lyrics.

1301
00:41:44,726 --> 00:41:47,306
It's going to be an EDM song.

1302
00:41:47,525 --> 00:41:48,725
Like this.

1303
00:41:48,726 --> 00:41:50,021
How does an EDM song sound?

1304
00:41:50,525 --> 00:41:52,095
(What was EDM?)

1305
00:41:52,096 --> 00:41:53,234
That's not...

1306
00:41:53,235 --> 00:41:54,899
It sounds like ajaeng or a small gong.

1307
00:41:55,766 --> 00:41:56,888
Right?

1308
00:41:57,205 --> 00:41:59,905
(This is what EDM sounds like.)

1309
00:41:59,906 --> 00:42:01,099
That's it.

1310
00:42:02,005 --> 00:42:03,945
Soft and dry

1311
00:42:03,946 --> 00:42:07,814
(He gets into the old rhythm.)

1312
00:42:07,815 --> 00:42:09,175
(He has no idea what EDM is.)

1313
00:42:09,176 --> 00:42:12,175
- That's samulnori. - That's not how you do it.

1314
00:42:12,185 --> 00:42:13,454
It sounds like samulnori.

1315
00:42:13,455 --> 00:42:15,814
(It's an incomplete fusion of samulnori and EDM.)

1316
00:42:15,815 --> 00:42:17,785
(I should help him listen to EDM songs.)

1317
00:42:17,786 --> 00:42:18,925
That was hilarious.

1318
00:42:18,926 --> 00:42:23,281
All my melodies in my head are still from the 90s.

1319
00:42:23,696 --> 00:42:24,817
We've arrived.

1320
00:42:25,096 --> 00:42:27,104
- What is that? - There's something here.

1321
00:42:27,196 --> 00:42:28,563
There's the bouncy thing.

1322
00:42:29,165 --> 00:42:30,504
- Is that a trampoline? - Yes, it's a trampoline.

1323
00:42:30,505 --> 00:42:31,604
(What will their missions be this time?)

1324
00:42:31,605 --> 00:42:33,105
It's higher than I thought.

1325
00:42:33,636 --> 00:42:35,339
It looks like egg yolks.

1326
00:42:35,536 --> 00:42:37,004
It's a trampoline.

1327
00:42:37,005 --> 00:42:38,271
It's a trampoline.

1328
00:42:38,306 --> 00:42:39,374
Isn't it called...

1329
00:42:39,375 --> 00:42:41,914
What's that in the middle?

1330
00:42:41,915 --> 00:42:43,987
It looks like egg yolks!

1331
00:42:44,116 --> 00:42:45,945
(The balloons look like they're about to burst...)

1332
00:42:45,946 --> 00:42:48,454
(and there is a mat underneath.)

1333
00:42:48,455 --> 00:42:50,184
(What in the world is it for?)

1334
00:42:50,185 --> 00:42:51,552
I don't think we're supposed to get on it.

1335
00:42:51,656 --> 00:42:52,794
- No? - No.

1336
00:42:52,795 --> 00:42:55,024
I think it has to do with the water.

1337
00:42:55,025 --> 00:42:56,393
I really have no idea.

1338
00:42:57,326 --> 00:42:59,294
I just sang the "Soft and Dry Song" on the way here.

1339
00:42:59,295 --> 00:43:01,234
- It's suites the song. - The weather is dry.

1340
00:43:01,235 --> 00:43:03,135
- Soft and dry - Soft and dry

1341
00:43:03,136 --> 00:43:05,504
- Let's be soft and dry today - Let's be soft and dry today

1342
00:43:05,505 --> 00:43:06,862
(Soft and dry, Let's be soft and dry today)

1343
00:43:07,235 --> 00:43:09,975
(They all sing the song since it might be their last chance.)

1344
00:43:09,976 --> 00:43:13,075
The first mission, which can get you both the gold bars and meal tickets,

1345
00:43:13,076 --> 00:43:15,144
will be Save Me.

1346
00:43:15,145 --> 00:43:16,484
(The mission to get the gold bars and meal tickets, Save Me.)

1347
00:43:16,485 --> 00:43:17,745
- Ji Hyo, we can... - Let's at least get some food.

1348
00:43:17,746 --> 00:43:19,346
- Exactly. - We need to eat.

1349
00:43:19,485 --> 00:43:22,015
Two teams will be playing at a time.

1350
00:43:22,016 --> 00:43:24,524
One person from each team will lie face down...

1351
00:43:24,525 --> 00:43:27,095
under the trampoline that has water balloons on top...

1352
00:43:27,096 --> 00:43:29,995
and the other person will have to solve the quiz within the time.

1353
00:43:29,996 --> 00:43:31,695
You may escape from under the trampoline...

1354
00:43:31,696 --> 00:43:34,164
only if your teammate gets the answer.

1355
00:43:34,165 --> 00:43:37,164
If the balloon hasn't popped yet, even when the opposite team...

1356
00:43:37,165 --> 00:43:39,144
gets the answer right, you can still try and answer.

1357
00:43:40,005 --> 00:43:41,975
It's a quiz, Haha. We're doomed.

1358
00:43:41,976 --> 00:43:43,004
- We're doomed! - I'm sorry.

1359
00:43:43,005 --> 00:43:44,104
We're doomed.

1360
00:43:44,105 --> 00:43:45,445
What do we do?

1361
00:43:45,446 --> 00:43:46,475
We can do it.

1362
00:43:46,476 --> 00:43:48,075
- What did he say, Ji Hyo? - Okay.

1363
00:43:48,076 --> 00:43:49,269
What?

1364
00:43:49,786 --> 00:43:51,484
This is driving me crazy.

1365
00:43:51,485 --> 00:43:52,785
What did he say, Ji Hyo?

1366
00:43:52,786 --> 00:43:53,854
I couldn't hear him.

1367
00:43:53,855 --> 00:43:55,555
- Could you repeat that? - How long haven't you heard him?

1368
00:43:55,556 --> 00:43:58,953
I think they are completely doomed.

1369
00:43:59,125 --> 00:44:01,454
They're doomed. You know how she is, right?

1370
00:44:01,455 --> 00:44:04,164
I don't think she ever understands the mission.

1371
00:44:04,165 --> 00:44:06,394
She just goes with the flow!

1372
00:44:06,395 --> 00:44:08,394
Do I have to understand? I can still play without understanding it.

1373
00:44:08,395 --> 00:44:09,564
- Exactly! - Wake up!

1374
00:44:09,565 --> 00:44:12,035
So the top two teams will get meal tickets,

1375
00:44:12,036 --> 00:44:13,841
and the top team gets two tickets to reveal other teams' territories,

1376
00:44:14,036 --> 00:44:16,905
- while the runner-up gets one. - Let's at least place second.

1377
00:44:16,906 --> 00:44:18,504
We need to get at least second place.

1378
00:44:18,505 --> 00:44:20,414
- This is... - We need to be at least second.

1379
00:44:20,415 --> 00:44:23,715
Third and fourth place will only get rice and dried laver.

1380
00:44:23,716 --> 00:44:25,515
- That's it? - Come on.

1381
00:44:25,516 --> 00:44:28,412
Whoever is going under, please lie face down.

1382
00:44:28,556 --> 00:44:29,624
(First Round, Kwang Soo and So Min versus Jae Seok and Ji Hyo)

1383
00:44:29,625 --> 00:44:30,706
Get it right.

1384
00:44:30,926 --> 00:44:33,195
- You have to get it right. - So Min, you're trusting Kwang Soo?

1385
00:44:33,196 --> 00:44:34,655
- You have to get it right. - She's trusting Kwang Soo on this.

1386
00:44:34,656 --> 00:44:36,794
Let's go, Kwang Soo! You can do this.

1387
00:44:36,795 --> 00:44:38,459
Show them what you've got, Kwang Soo!

1388
00:44:38,726 --> 00:44:40,765
The first one is about songs.

1389
00:44:40,766 --> 00:44:41,834
Songs? That sounds great.

1390
00:44:41,835 --> 00:44:42,894
- Let's go! - Hey!

1391
00:44:42,895 --> 00:44:45,405
- Ji Hyo! You can do this, right? - We can do it!

1392
00:44:45,406 --> 00:44:48,075
- Let's show them. We won't lose. - Okay.

1393
00:44:48,076 --> 00:44:49,704
Who will go first? Please play rock-paper-scissors.

1394
00:44:49,705 --> 00:44:51,408
Rock-paper-scissors!

1395
00:44:51,676 --> 00:44:53,582
(Ji Hyo goes first!)

1396
00:44:54,116 --> 00:44:55,675
I'm bad at being quick.

1397
00:44:55,676 --> 00:44:57,044
We will begin.

1398
00:44:57,045 --> 00:44:58,385
Name five song titles...

1399
00:44:58,386 --> 00:45:01,584
that contain breaking up with a lover.

1400
00:45:01,585 --> 00:45:04,925
(Five song titles that contain breaking up with a lover.)

1401
00:45:04,926 --> 00:45:06,254
Within five seconds. Begin!

1402
00:45:06,255 --> 00:45:08,235
- "Goodbye", - 5, 4,

1403
00:45:08,355 --> 00:45:10,195
"Say Goodbye", "Don't Say Goodbye"...

1404
00:45:10,196 --> 00:45:11,899
What are you doing? What was that?

1405
00:45:12,525 --> 00:45:14,035
(You're making me worried.)

1406
00:45:14,036 --> 00:45:16,405
- What is she... - What was that?

1407
00:45:16,406 --> 00:45:19,904
"Love Equation". "Saying Goodbye Is Sad"...

1408
00:45:20,306 --> 00:45:21,434
"Good"...

1409
00:45:21,435 --> 00:45:23,619
- There's "Star" by GB9. - "Farewell Taxi"

1410
00:45:24,005 --> 00:45:25,905
"Farewell Trip", "Love Equation",

1411
00:45:25,906 --> 00:45:27,140
"Farewell Taxi"...

1412
00:45:27,246 --> 00:45:28,470
- "Farewell Bus". - "Fare"...

1413
00:45:28,616 --> 00:45:30,044
Ji Hyo!

1414
00:45:30,045 --> 00:45:32,285
"Farewell Trip", "Farewell Taxi",

1415
00:45:32,286 --> 00:45:33,846
"If There was Practice in Farewells".

1416
00:45:34,315 --> 00:45:36,115
"If There was Practice in"...

1417
00:45:36,116 --> 00:45:38,024
In farewells! "If There was Practice in Farewells".

1418
00:45:38,025 --> 00:45:39,825
"Farewell", "Farewell Taxi", "Farewell Bus"...

1419
00:45:39,826 --> 00:45:40,995
No, not bus.

1420
00:45:40,996 --> 00:45:42,016
("Farewell Bus"? She failed.)

1421
00:45:42,255 --> 00:45:43,294
(She was doing well,)

1422
00:45:43,295 --> 00:45:45,570
(but she suddenly said "Farewell Bus".)

1423
00:45:46,096 --> 00:45:47,493
Let's take the bus!

1424
00:45:47,636 --> 00:45:48,865
- Ji Hyo! - 10 seconds!

1425
00:45:48,866 --> 00:45:51,252
"Farewell", "Farewell Taxi",

1426
00:45:51,335 --> 00:45:53,783
"If There was Practice in Farewells".

1427
00:45:54,235 --> 00:45:55,535
- "If You Need Practice"? - Five.

1428
00:45:55,536 --> 00:45:57,646
(His 5 seconds are up. We're doomed.)

1429
00:45:57,705 --> 00:46:00,345
- 4, 3, - "Farewell", "Farewell Taxi",

1430
00:46:00,346 --> 00:46:02,314
"Farewell Trip", "Love Equation"...

1431
00:46:02,815 --> 00:46:05,295
(Time is up.)

1432
00:46:06,716 --> 00:46:08,959
(Pop!)

1433
00:46:09,955 --> 00:46:12,913
(The water pours down after 100 seconds.)

1434
00:46:13,156 --> 00:46:16,564
(Watch out for heavy rain.)

1435
00:46:16,565 --> 00:46:17,825
What is this?

1436
00:46:17,826 --> 00:46:19,426
- It's a flood! - What's this?

1437
00:46:19,525 --> 00:46:20,535
That much?

1438
00:46:20,536 --> 00:46:22,294
(Did they have to go this far?)

1439
00:46:22,295 --> 00:46:23,564
What's this?

1440
00:46:23,565 --> 00:46:24,758
You're pouring this much?

1441
00:46:24,835 --> 00:46:26,064
This is...

1442
00:46:26,065 --> 00:46:27,075
(Miserable)

1443
00:46:27,076 --> 00:46:29,104
You look like you committed high treason.

1444
00:46:29,105 --> 00:46:31,975
(She kneels down like a criminal.)

1445
00:46:31,976 --> 00:46:33,515
You look like Ae Bong.

1446
00:46:33,516 --> 00:46:35,374
(Aren't you Ae Bong?)

1447
00:46:35,375 --> 00:46:36,609
She looks like me, doesn't she?

1448
00:46:37,185 --> 00:46:38,410
She looks like me now.

1449
00:46:38,786 --> 00:46:39,914
The water is...

1450
00:46:39,915 --> 00:46:41,155
It's unbelievable.

1451
00:46:41,156 --> 00:46:42,914
It keeps pouring down.

1452
00:46:42,915 --> 00:46:43,954
I know.

1453
00:46:43,955 --> 00:46:46,325
- There's so much water. - It doesn't come down together.

1454
00:46:46,326 --> 00:46:47,856
This is...

1455
00:46:48,355 --> 00:46:49,998
Let's put in less water now.

1456
00:46:52,096 --> 00:46:54,934
(Now I know what you're trying to do to us, so put in less water please.)

1457
00:46:54,935 --> 00:46:56,293
- Who are you talking to? - Put in less water please.

1458
00:46:57,435 --> 00:46:59,135
- What are you saying? - I mean...

1459
00:46:59,136 --> 00:47:01,523
- What are you doing? - Let's put in less water now.

1460
00:47:01,735 --> 00:47:03,075
This is hard.

1461
00:47:03,076 --> 00:47:04,175
Five seconds is hard.

1462
00:47:04,176 --> 00:47:05,745
- Let's move on. - Okay.

1463
00:47:05,746 --> 00:47:06,845
- Let's do this. - Let's go!

1464
00:47:06,846 --> 00:47:08,753
- We can do this. - Please play rock-paper-scissors.

1465
00:47:09,045 --> 00:47:10,385
Rock-paper-scissors!

1466
00:47:10,386 --> 00:47:11,544
(They play rock-paper-scissors to see who gets to go first.)

1467
00:47:11,545 --> 00:47:13,962
(So Min won and Jae Seok lost.)

1468
00:47:14,016 --> 00:47:15,240
I lost.

1469
00:47:15,485 --> 00:47:16,555
We will begin.

1470
00:47:16,556 --> 00:47:20,299
Tell me 5 great people in history who have 4-syllable names. Begin!

1471
00:47:20,455 --> 00:47:23,524
(5 great people in history who have 4-syllable names.)

1472
00:47:23,525 --> 00:47:24,664
5, 4,

1473
00:47:24,665 --> 00:47:26,064
- Je Gal Gong Myeong. - 3,

1474
00:47:26,065 --> 00:47:27,697
Sister Ryu Gwan Sun.

1475
00:47:29,266 --> 00:47:30,968
Sejong the Great, Park Hyeok Geo Se,

1476
00:47:31,165 --> 00:47:33,104
Je Gal Gong Myeong...

1477
00:47:33,105 --> 00:47:34,234
(5 seconds is up.)

1478
00:47:34,235 --> 00:47:35,632
- This is hard. - This is hard.

1479
00:47:36,136 --> 00:47:38,544
So Min, try to come up with foreigners.

1480
00:47:38,545 --> 00:47:39,644
(It's So Min's turn, but a while ago...)

1481
00:47:39,645 --> 00:47:40,945
(Say foreign people, So Min!)

1482
00:47:40,946 --> 00:47:42,575
(Hellen Keller!)

1483
00:47:42,576 --> 00:47:44,015
(Okay, Hellen Keller.)

1484
00:47:44,016 --> 00:47:45,066
I need one more!

1485
00:47:45,216 --> 00:47:47,184
Helen Keller, Park Hyeok Geo Se,

1486
00:47:47,185 --> 00:47:49,328
Je Gal Gong Myeong, Dokgo Young Jae?

1487
00:47:51,056 --> 00:47:53,124
(Dokgo Young Jae is a great person in history?)

1488
00:47:53,125 --> 00:47:54,394
What? Wait!

1489
00:47:54,395 --> 00:47:55,995
- "Dokgo Young Jae"? - "Dokgo Young Jae".

1490
00:47:55,996 --> 00:47:57,325
- Je Gal Gong Myeong, - Namgoong Ok Boon.

1491
00:47:57,326 --> 00:47:58,621
Namgoong Ok Boon.

1492
00:47:59,395 --> 00:48:00,793
Stop that.

1493
00:48:00,835 --> 00:48:01,965
Stop saying things from behind me.

1494
00:48:01,966 --> 00:48:03,905
Hellen Keller, Je Gal Gong Myeong,

1495
00:48:03,906 --> 00:48:05,129
Park Hyeok Geo Se...

1496
00:48:05,665 --> 00:48:06,805
Brother Jong Kook.

1497
00:48:06,806 --> 00:48:08,131
"Brother Jong Kook"?

1498
00:48:08,275 --> 00:48:10,675
(Brother Jong Kook is a great person in history?)

1499
00:48:10,676 --> 00:48:12,245
Sejong the Great, Park Hyeok Geo Se...

1500
00:48:12,246 --> 00:48:14,475
Sejong the Great, Park Hyeok Geo Se, Hellen Keller,

1501
00:48:14,476 --> 00:48:15,874
Je Gal Gong Myeong...

1502
00:48:15,875 --> 00:48:17,039
Hwangwoo Seul Hye.

1503
00:48:17,616 --> 00:48:19,515
Hellen Keller, Je Gal Gong Myeong,

1504
00:48:19,516 --> 00:48:22,115
- Sunwoo Jae Duk. - Sejong the Great.

1505
00:48:22,116 --> 00:48:24,024
Hellen Keller, Je Gal Gong Myeong, Sejong the Great,

1506
00:48:24,025 --> 00:48:25,454
Park Hyeok Geo Se, Pasteur.

1507
00:48:25,455 --> 00:48:27,598
But isn't Park Hyeok Geo Se a mythical character?

1508
00:48:27,855 --> 00:48:29,095
(Is Park Hyeok Geo Se a great person in history?)

1509
00:48:29,096 --> 00:48:30,195
- He's a great person in history. - And...

1510
00:48:30,196 --> 00:48:32,365
- No, he's not! - He is.

1511
00:48:32,366 --> 00:48:33,762
Okay!

1512
00:48:33,835 --> 00:48:34,989
- Jae Seok! - Hurry!

1513
00:48:36,065 --> 00:48:37,434
- Jae Seok! - Hurry!

1514
00:48:37,435 --> 00:48:38,704
- Hurry, So Min! - Jae Seok!

1515
00:48:38,705 --> 00:48:40,374
That was amazing!

1516
00:48:40,375 --> 00:48:41,630
Hurry, So Min!

1517
00:48:41,705 --> 00:48:42,905
Say the five people!

1518
00:48:42,906 --> 00:48:44,129
Say the five people!

1519
00:48:44,375 --> 00:48:45,445
Sejong the Great, Je Gal Gong Myeong,

1520
00:48:45,446 --> 00:48:47,044
- Park Hyeok Geo Se, Pasteur, - Dokgo Young Jae.

1521
00:48:47,045 --> 00:48:50,152
(She has 6 seconds left, and she has one more to go!)

1522
00:48:50,153 --> 00:48:52,193
(The last answer is .... )

1523
00:48:52,225 --> 00:48:53,480
Hurry, So Min!

1524
00:48:53,555 --> 00:48:54,755
Say the five people!

1525
00:48:54,756 --> 00:48:55,979
Say the five people!

1526
00:48:56,225 --> 00:48:57,295
Sejong the Great, Je Gal Gong Myeong,

1527
00:48:57,296 --> 00:48:58,918
- Park Hyeok Geo Se, Pasteur, - Dokgo Young Jae.

1528
00:48:58,919 --> 00:48:59,918
Dokgo Young Jae.

1529
00:48:59,919 --> 00:49:00,969
(Dokgo Young Jae?)

1530
00:49:01,024 --> 00:49:02,622
Just keep going, So Min!

1531
00:49:02,623 --> 00:49:04,352
Hellen Keller, Je Gal Gong Myeong,

1532
00:49:04,353 --> 00:49:05,753
Pasteur, Sejong the Great,

1533
00:49:05,754 --> 00:49:07,049
Je Gal Gong Myeong...

1534
00:49:07,293 --> 00:49:08,345
I'm sorry.

1535
00:49:08,663 --> 00:49:11,723
(The water pours down after 100 seconds.)

1536
00:49:11,893 --> 00:49:14,403
(I'll make those who sabotaged her pay for this!)

1537
00:49:14,404 --> 00:49:15,729
That's a nice facial expression.

1538
00:49:16,603 --> 00:49:19,562
(Let's watch it one more time.)

1539
00:49:21,043 --> 00:49:23,829
(It's so easy to make people laugh with your face, isn't it?)

1540
00:49:24,513 --> 00:49:26,553
(She is sorry, but it's funny.)

1541
00:49:27,143 --> 00:49:28,783
- That's a nice facial expression. - Okay!

1542
00:49:28,784 --> 00:49:31,113
- That's a great expression. - It's good.

1543
00:49:31,114 --> 00:49:32,383
I'm sorry.

1544
00:49:32,384 --> 00:49:34,053
Jae Seok already said all five! Why couldn't you...

1545
00:49:34,054 --> 00:49:35,483
(Jae Seok and Ji Hyo move up to the finals!)

1546
00:49:35,484 --> 00:49:37,055
We will continue on with the next team.

1547
00:49:37,123 --> 00:49:38,990
Don't worry, Jong Kook!

1548
00:49:39,324 --> 00:49:42,527
I'm already worried.

1549
00:49:42,623 --> 00:49:43,762
Don't worry.

1550
00:49:43,763 --> 00:49:45,533
Don't worry.

1551
00:49:45,534 --> 00:49:47,733
- We will begin. - Let's go, the king of quiz!

1552
00:49:47,734 --> 00:49:48,784
Let's go!

1553
00:49:48,833 --> 00:49:50,332
Please play rock-paper-scissors.

1554
00:49:50,333 --> 00:49:51,403
Rock-paper-scissors!

1555
00:49:51,404 --> 00:49:53,573
(Seok Jin wins.)

1556
00:49:53,574 --> 00:49:54,624
Okay.

1557
00:49:55,404 --> 00:49:56,742
- We will begin now. - Okay.

1558
00:49:56,743 --> 00:49:59,312
Give me five movie titles that have numbers in them...

1559
00:49:59,313 --> 00:50:00,343
in five seconds.

1560
00:50:00,344 --> 00:50:01,771
"Nine", "Se7en",

1561
00:50:02,513 --> 00:50:04,043
"666"...

1562
00:50:04,214 --> 00:50:05,582
(5 seconds is up.)

1563
00:50:05,583 --> 00:50:07,593
- "Miracle on 1st Street". - "666".

1564
00:50:07,784 --> 00:50:08,823
There's no such thing as "666".

1565
00:50:08,824 --> 00:50:10,392
"Nine", "Se7en", "666",

1566
00:50:10,393 --> 00:50:12,492
"Miracle on 1st Street", and "21".

1567
00:50:12,493 --> 00:50:14,292
("Nine", "Se7en", "666", "Miracle on 1st Street", and "21".)

1568
00:50:14,293 --> 00:50:18,963
(Will all his answers be correct?)

1569
00:50:18,964 --> 00:50:20,289
- Where they play Black Jack. "21". - That's right.

1570
00:50:20,464 --> 00:50:21,832
- It's a Hollywood movie. - Does it...

1571
00:50:21,833 --> 00:50:22,925
Really?

1572
00:50:23,234 --> 00:50:24,233
Haha!

1573
00:50:24,234 --> 00:50:25,832
(The posters of the movies he mentioned.)

1574
00:50:25,833 --> 00:50:27,945
- You're so great! - Amazing!

1575
00:50:28,143 --> 00:50:29,571
"Nine"! Wait! I'm sorry.

1576
00:50:29,844 --> 00:50:31,404
Isn't it "Miracle on 7th Street"?

1577
00:50:31,844 --> 00:50:33,273
It's not "Miracle on 1st Street".

1578
00:50:33,274 --> 00:50:34,912
- No, it's 1st. - It's correct.

1579
00:50:34,913 --> 00:50:36,042
- It exists. - The three of you...

1580
00:50:36,043 --> 00:50:37,312
- It's 1st Street. - Say it!

1581
00:50:37,313 --> 00:50:38,383
It's right.

1582
00:50:38,384 --> 00:50:39,404
"Nine", "Seven"...

1583
00:50:41,024 --> 00:50:43,023
"Seven", "11th Street"...

1584
00:50:43,024 --> 00:50:44,318
"11th Street"?

1585
00:50:44,493 --> 00:50:46,863
(The movie title is "11th Street"?)

1586
00:50:46,864 --> 00:50:47,863
- Are you going shopping? - "11th Street"?

1587
00:50:47,864 --> 00:50:49,323
Let's go shopping!

1588
00:50:49,324 --> 00:50:51,233
"11th Street"?

1589
00:50:51,234 --> 00:50:52,562
What are you saying?

1590
00:50:52,563 --> 00:50:54,133
- "Nine", "The Sixth Sense", - Ten!

1591
00:50:54,134 --> 00:50:55,432
The convenience store's name.

1592
00:50:55,433 --> 00:50:58,055
(Haha tries to sabotage Seok Jin.)

1593
00:50:58,304 --> 00:50:59,803
Twenty what?

1594
00:50:59,804 --> 00:51:00,894
Be quiet.

1595
00:51:02,404 --> 00:51:04,209
- "Nine", "The Sixth Sense", - Ten!

1596
00:51:05,174 --> 00:51:06,273
(5 seconds is up.)

1597
00:51:06,274 --> 00:51:08,528
- "666". - "Nine", "The Sixth Sense",

1598
00:51:08,643 --> 00:51:10,112
"Seven"!

1599
00:51:10,953 --> 00:51:12,582
You forgot "Seven"!

1600
00:51:12,583 --> 00:51:13,883
- Begin! - The Korean War movie.

1601
00:51:13,884 --> 00:51:16,026
"Nine", "The Secret of the Korean War"...

1602
00:51:18,293 --> 00:51:20,302
"The Secret of the Korean War"?

1603
00:51:20,623 --> 00:51:22,735
- I'm sorry, wait. - Go!

1604
00:51:22,864 --> 00:51:24,792
- 5, 4, - "Nine", "Sixth Sense",

1605
00:51:24,793 --> 00:51:26,292
- 3, 2, - "666",

1606
00:51:26,293 --> 00:51:28,503
("Nine", "Sixth Sense", "666")

1607
00:51:28,504 --> 00:51:29,686
- 1. - "61..."

1608
00:51:29,933 --> 00:51:31,673
- "61"? - "11th Street" is still on my mind.

1609
00:51:31,674 --> 00:51:33,163
(Bursting)

1610
00:51:35,743 --> 00:51:38,936
(I knew it.)

1611
00:51:39,243 --> 00:51:41,483
I was saved!

1612
00:51:41,484 --> 00:51:43,142
He is the king of quiz!

1613
00:51:43,143 --> 00:51:44,983
- Haha is good. - The married...

1614
00:51:44,984 --> 00:51:45,983
- king of quiz! - The king of quiz!

1615
00:51:45,984 --> 00:51:47,352
I am sorry, Jong Kook.

1616
00:51:47,353 --> 00:51:49,182
Seok Jin had no intention of getting this question right.

1617
00:51:49,183 --> 00:51:50,193
That's not true.

1618
00:51:50,194 --> 00:51:52,492
(Seok Jin had no intention of getting this question right.)

1619
00:51:52,493 --> 00:51:53,562
(That's not true.)

1620
00:51:53,563 --> 00:51:54,583
That's not true.

1621
00:51:54,793 --> 00:51:57,292
That was a barbed comment.

1622
00:51:57,293 --> 00:51:59,662
- I had no expectations. - That's not true.

1623
00:51:59,663 --> 00:52:02,051
- I had no expectations. - It's not like that.

1624
00:52:02,103 --> 00:52:03,972
Jong Kook, you are very angry.

1625
00:52:03,973 --> 00:52:05,360
- I had no expectations. - Seriously.

1626
00:52:05,504 --> 00:52:06,872
Jong Kook, you are very angry.

1627
00:52:06,873 --> 00:52:09,102
I will also answer the question in a relaxed way.

1628
00:52:09,103 --> 00:52:11,113
Jong Kook, you are the only one I can depend on.

1629
00:52:11,143 --> 00:52:12,713
You need to win for us to make it to the final match.

1630
00:52:12,714 --> 00:52:13,943
Let's do this in a relaxed way.

1631
00:52:13,944 --> 00:52:15,582
- Let's begin. - Seok Jin, go under the trampoline.

1632
00:52:15,583 --> 00:52:16,838
Okay.

1633
00:52:16,953 --> 00:52:18,253
Play rock-paper-scissors.

1634
00:52:18,254 --> 00:52:19,283
Rock-paper-scissors.

1635
00:52:19,284 --> 00:52:21,394
(They play rock-paper-scissors and Se Chan wins.)

1636
00:52:21,953 --> 00:52:23,311
- Let's begin. - Okay.

1637
00:52:23,484 --> 00:52:24,819
In five seconds,

1638
00:52:25,123 --> 00:52:27,963
name five movie titles with a region.

1639
00:52:27,964 --> 00:52:28,963
(Movie titles...)

1640
00:52:28,964 --> 00:52:30,863
(with a region?)

1641
00:52:30,864 --> 00:52:32,062
- A region? - Se Chan, you will lose.

1642
00:52:32,063 --> 00:52:33,932
- 4, 3, - You will lose.

1643
00:52:33,933 --> 00:52:35,433
- 2, 1. - A region?

1644
00:52:36,464 --> 00:52:38,503
- "The Power of Kangwon Province". - That's a good one.

1645
00:52:38,504 --> 00:52:39,900
"Gwangju..."

1646
00:52:40,873 --> 00:52:41,872
(5 seconds are up.)

1647
00:52:41,873 --> 00:52:42,925
"Milyang".

1648
00:52:43,473 --> 00:52:45,310
"Milyang", "Gokseong"...

1649
00:52:45,614 --> 00:52:46,971
"Leaving Las Vegas".

1650
00:52:47,114 --> 00:52:48,644
"The Memories of Las Vegas".

1651
00:52:48,714 --> 00:52:51,053
- "The Memories of Las Vegas"? - It's "Leaving Las Vegas".

1652
00:52:51,054 --> 00:52:52,783
(Jong Kook, it's "Leaving Las Vegas".)

1653
00:52:52,784 --> 00:52:54,384
"Leaving Las Vegas".

1654
00:52:54,683 --> 00:52:55,703
"Milyang" and "Gokseong".

1655
00:52:56,583 --> 00:52:58,352
What are you doing?

1656
00:52:58,353 --> 00:52:59,782
(Why aren't you answering?)

1657
00:53:00,094 --> 00:53:01,193
- "Milyang" and "Gokseong". - My goodness.

1658
00:53:01,194 --> 00:53:02,825
"Leaving Las Vegas".

1659
00:53:02,964 --> 00:53:04,697
Jong Kook has no intention of answering the question.

1660
00:53:04,864 --> 00:53:05,914
Hey, hey.

1661
00:53:06,563 --> 00:53:08,662
"Silmido", "The Power of Kangwon Province",

1662
00:53:08,663 --> 00:53:10,233
"Gokseong", "Milyang", and "Leaving Las Vegas".

1663
00:53:10,234 --> 00:53:11,233
(In 5 seconds, name 5 movie titles with a region.)

1664
00:53:11,234 --> 00:53:12,832
- Okay. - Okay.

1665
00:53:12,833 --> 00:53:14,102
- Haha. - Hey.

1666
00:53:14,103 --> 00:53:15,633
(Good job, Se Chan.)

1667
00:53:15,844 --> 00:53:17,649
(Running)

1668
00:53:18,313 --> 00:53:22,042
- Jong Kook won't answer. - No, he won't.

1669
00:53:22,043 --> 00:53:24,012
- Hey. - Two,

1670
00:53:24,013 --> 00:53:26,082
- one. - What are you doing?

1671
00:53:26,083 --> 00:53:28,266
"Milyang", "Gokseong", "Leaving Las Vegas",

1672
00:53:28,484 --> 00:53:30,182
and "The Power of Kangwon Province".

1673
00:53:30,183 --> 00:53:32,352
If you are so good at the quiz, why did you do that earlier?

1674
00:53:32,353 --> 00:53:34,593
(If you are so good at the quiz, why did you do that earlier?)

1675
00:53:34,594 --> 00:53:36,124
(His conscience is pricked.)

1676
00:53:36,464 --> 00:53:37,892
(Seok Jin got what he deserved.)

1677
00:53:37,893 --> 00:53:39,193
- 10, - Hurry up.

1678
00:53:39,194 --> 00:53:41,202
- 9, 8. - The time is ticking.

1679
00:53:41,203 --> 00:53:42,463
- "The Power of Kangwon Province". - "The Power of Kangwon Province",

1680
00:53:42,464 --> 00:53:43,733
- "Milyang", "Gokseong", - "Milyang".

1681
00:53:43,734 --> 00:53:44,903
- and "Leaving Las Vegas". - "Leaving Las Vegas".

1682
00:53:44,904 --> 00:53:46,637
- That's right. - "Gokseong".

1683
00:53:46,703 --> 00:53:48,377
He couldn't think of another one.

1684
00:53:48,404 --> 00:53:51,613
He just needed one more.

1685
00:53:51,614 --> 00:53:54,164
(It's time over and he gets drenched in water.)

1686
00:53:54,813 --> 00:53:56,983
- My goodness. - Why didn't his face get any water?

1687
00:53:56,984 --> 00:53:59,330
(What? Why is his face fine?)

1688
00:54:00,154 --> 00:54:01,383
Why didn't his face get any water?

1689
00:54:01,384 --> 00:54:02,547
Why is his face dry?

1690
00:54:02,924 --> 00:54:04,452
Hurry up and put your face under the water.

1691
00:54:04,453 --> 00:54:06,992
Why didn't your face get drenched?

1692
00:54:06,993 --> 00:54:09,023
It's not my fault the water fell this way!

1693
00:54:09,024 --> 00:54:11,440
(It's not my fault the water fell this way!)

1694
00:54:11,763 --> 00:54:13,562
Your face should have gotten drenched.

1695
00:54:13,563 --> 00:54:14,602
The water fell this way!

1696
00:54:14,603 --> 00:54:16,233
You should have moved.

1697
00:54:16,234 --> 00:54:17,972
Listen. It's not my fault the water fell this way.

1698
00:54:17,973 --> 00:54:19,202
That wasn't funny at all.

1699
00:54:19,203 --> 00:54:21,003
Don't be ridiculous. I don't care if it was funny or not.

1700
00:54:21,004 --> 00:54:24,142
(Try to be funny.)

1701
00:54:24,143 --> 00:54:26,012
My entire body is wet. Don't be ridiculous.

1702
00:54:26,013 --> 00:54:27,613
Your face should have gotten wet.

1703
00:54:27,614 --> 00:54:30,383
It's not my fault. I lied down next to Haha,

1704
00:54:30,384 --> 00:54:31,582
but the water fell to my butt.

1705
00:54:31,583 --> 00:54:33,283
He is sullen. He is sullen.

1706
00:54:33,284 --> 00:54:34,383
- He is sullen. - Is he a child?

1707
00:54:34,384 --> 00:54:35,883
- Seok Jin is annoyed. - He is sullen.

1708
00:54:35,884 --> 00:54:37,593
Seok Jin is sullen.

1709
00:54:37,594 --> 00:54:39,392
- Why are you picking on me? - That wasn't funny at all.

1710
00:54:39,393 --> 00:54:42,023
- Why didn't they move the balloons? - Your face should have gotten wet.

1711
00:54:42,024 --> 00:54:43,492
No one cares your butt got wet.

1712
00:54:43,493 --> 00:54:45,562
The balloons were at the wrong place!

1713
00:54:45,563 --> 00:54:46,562
I'm not talking about that.

1714
00:54:46,563 --> 00:54:49,359
(It's not my fault.)

1715
00:54:49,404 --> 00:54:50,972
He is angry.

1716
00:54:50,973 --> 00:54:52,003
Seok Jin is sullen.

1717
00:54:52,004 --> 00:54:54,042
- For goodness' sake. - The balloons were far back.

1718
00:54:54,043 --> 00:54:55,503
The 3rd and 4th place have been decided.

1719
00:54:55,504 --> 00:54:56,673
- Okay. - Okay.

1720
00:54:56,674 --> 00:54:57,999
It's time for the final match.

1721
00:54:58,214 --> 00:54:59,943
- Let's do this. - We can do it.

1722
00:54:59,944 --> 00:55:01,239
This is the final match to decide the 1st and 2nd place.

1723
00:55:01,614 --> 00:55:03,551
The 1st place gets 2 tickets to reveal other teams' land.

1724
00:55:03,813 --> 00:55:05,925
It's really important to place first.

1725
00:55:06,013 --> 00:55:07,352
Jae Seok, let's go.

1726
00:55:07,353 --> 00:55:08,608
- All right. - Please.

1727
00:55:08,654 --> 00:55:09,852
The king of knowledge, let's go.

1728
00:55:09,853 --> 00:55:11,392
- Let's begin. - Let's go.

1729
00:55:11,393 --> 00:55:12,823
Rock-paper-scissors.

1730
00:55:12,824 --> 00:55:13,992
(They play rock-paper-scissors...)

1731
00:55:13,993 --> 00:55:15,693
(and Haha wins.)

1732
00:55:15,694 --> 00:55:16,722
Gosh, I won.

1733
00:55:16,723 --> 00:55:18,392
No! Just don't answer it.

1734
00:55:18,393 --> 00:55:19,485
You can go first.

1735
00:55:19,734 --> 00:55:21,102
In five seconds,

1736
00:55:21,103 --> 00:55:22,102
(In five seconds...)

1737
00:55:22,103 --> 00:55:24,602
name 5 Korean movies with the 2-character title.

1738
00:55:24,603 --> 00:55:25,602
Korean movies?

1739
00:55:25,603 --> 00:55:29,042
(In 5 seconds, name 5 Korean movies with the 2-character title.)

1740
00:55:29,043 --> 00:55:30,972
- Five. - "Bloody Tie".

1741
00:55:30,973 --> 00:55:32,647
"Bloody Tie".

1742
00:55:33,614 --> 00:55:34,807
(5 seconds are up.)

1743
00:55:35,013 --> 00:55:36,912
"Bloody Tie", "The Unjust".

1744
00:55:36,913 --> 00:55:39,713
"The Unjust", "Bloody Tie", "Public Enemy", 1, 2.

1745
00:55:39,714 --> 00:55:41,968
(1, 2.)

1746
00:55:43,083 --> 00:55:44,952
"The Unjust", "Violent Prosecutor",

1747
00:55:44,953 --> 00:55:46,823
"Public Enemy", 1, 2.

1748
00:55:46,824 --> 00:55:48,802
Come on! Don't do that!

1749
00:55:48,924 --> 00:55:50,832
- "Madame Aema". - "Madame Aema".

1750
00:55:50,833 --> 00:55:52,133
"Madame Aema".

1751
00:55:52,134 --> 00:55:53,733
What? It works.

1752
00:55:53,734 --> 00:55:55,503
"Bloody Tie", "Madame Aema".

1753
00:55:55,504 --> 00:55:56,803
- "Madame Cow". - And...

1754
00:55:56,804 --> 00:56:00,943
Hold on. "Madame Cow", "Madame Aema", "Madame Cherry".

1755
00:56:00,944 --> 00:56:02,403
(He names all the sexy movies.)

1756
00:56:02,404 --> 00:56:03,702
- Hey, hey. - What?

1757
00:56:03,703 --> 00:56:05,274
(Don't do that, you punk.)

1758
00:56:05,373 --> 00:56:07,113
- What? - Those movies exist.

1759
00:56:07,114 --> 00:56:08,943
- 3, 2, - "Bloody Tie".

1760
00:56:08,944 --> 00:56:10,544
- one. - "Ideology..."

1761
00:56:11,254 --> 00:56:13,019
- "Red Hood". - "Red Fox".

1762
00:56:13,513 --> 00:56:15,122
My goodness.

1763
00:56:15,123 --> 00:56:16,409
Gosh, it's cold!

1764
00:56:18,123 --> 00:56:21,663
(Both teams failed to score, so they get drenched in water.)

1765
00:56:22,864 --> 00:56:24,932
(They get completely drenched.)

1766
00:56:24,933 --> 00:56:25,932
It's like a waterfall.

1767
00:56:25,933 --> 00:56:26,932
This is too hard.

1768
00:56:26,933 --> 00:56:29,033
There are so many Hong Kong movies which fit the condition.

1769
00:56:29,034 --> 00:56:31,788
"Bloody Tie", "The Unjust", and "Mamma Mia!"

1770
00:56:31,904 --> 00:56:32,903
"Mamma Mia!" isn't a Korean movie.

1771
00:56:32,904 --> 00:56:34,576
- We needed to name Korean movies. - Isn't "Mamma Mia!" a Korean movie?

1772
00:56:35,043 --> 00:56:37,115
What kind of question was that?

1773
00:56:37,413 --> 00:56:39,004
- Go under the trampoline. - Okay.

1774
00:56:39,114 --> 00:56:41,512
- Let's go. - Haha is completely dry.

1775
00:56:41,513 --> 00:56:42,666
Help me this once.

1776
00:56:43,114 --> 00:56:44,912
- Fine. - How will that help us?

1777
00:56:44,913 --> 00:56:47,283
If they place 1st, they can check 2 pieces of land.

1778
00:56:47,284 --> 00:56:48,283
That's right.

1779
00:56:48,284 --> 00:56:49,923
Promise us you won't check our land.

1780
00:56:49,924 --> 00:56:51,352
- Okay. - Promise us.

1781
00:56:51,353 --> 00:56:52,952
- We won't do it. - Then we will help you.

1782
00:56:52,953 --> 00:56:54,722
- We will do our best. - I trust you to keep your promise.

1783
00:56:54,723 --> 00:56:55,814
I will keep my promise.

1784
00:56:55,964 --> 00:56:57,392
Se Chan, let's stay dry.

1785
00:56:57,393 --> 00:56:59,193
Haha, I will try to be the king of quiz.

1786
00:56:59,194 --> 00:57:00,214
Play rock-paper-scissors.

1787
00:57:00,293 --> 00:57:02,363
Rock-paper-scissors.

1788
00:57:02,364 --> 00:57:04,133
(They play rock-paper-scissors and Ji Hyo wins.)

1789
00:57:04,134 --> 00:57:05,773
- Let's go. - Haha, we are going to lose.

1790
00:57:05,774 --> 00:57:06,832
Good luck. We will help you.

1791
00:57:06,833 --> 00:57:07,972
- Let's begin. - I don't know.

1792
00:57:07,973 --> 00:57:09,300
I don't know how the match between them will go.

1793
00:57:10,444 --> 00:57:11,872
(They are neck-and-neck.)

1794
00:57:11,873 --> 00:57:13,742
- I don't know. - The fight of a dragon and a tiger.

1795
00:57:13,743 --> 00:57:15,376
The fight of a dragon and a tiger.

1796
00:57:15,413 --> 00:57:18,213
I wouldn't know where to bet my money.

1797
00:57:18,214 --> 00:57:20,805
Preparing for the next game would be the wisest move.

1798
00:57:20,824 --> 00:57:22,352
That really would be the wisest move.

1799
00:57:22,353 --> 00:57:23,852
Ji Hyo, let's go.

1800
00:57:23,853 --> 00:57:25,292
- Okay. - Come on.

1801
00:57:25,293 --> 00:57:26,653
I can do it.

1802
00:57:26,654 --> 00:57:28,722
- I can do it. - You can do it.

1803
00:57:28,723 --> 00:57:29,784
In five seconds,

1804
00:57:30,194 --> 00:57:32,363
name five movie titles with a color.

1805
00:57:32,364 --> 00:57:33,516
Go.

1806
00:57:33,663 --> 00:57:34,932
"Red" and "Blue". "Red" and "Blue".

1807
00:57:34,933 --> 00:57:36,102
There are "Red" and "Blue".

1808
00:57:36,103 --> 00:57:38,202
- "Blue Door". - "Red" and "Blue".

1809
00:57:38,203 --> 00:57:39,972
- "Blue Door". - And...

1810
00:57:39,973 --> 00:57:41,268
"Anne of Green Cape".

1811
00:57:41,804 --> 00:57:43,843
"Anne of Green Cape"?

1812
00:57:43,844 --> 00:57:45,169
(Ji Hyo, now is your chance.)

1813
00:57:45,444 --> 00:57:47,312
"Red", "Blue", "Anne of Green Cape"...

1814
00:57:47,313 --> 00:57:48,915
- "Blue Valentine". - "Blue Valentine".

1815
00:57:49,683 --> 00:57:51,040
(Gosh, it isn't "Anne of Green Cape".)

1816
00:57:51,853 --> 00:57:54,168
"Black", "Red", "Blue",

1817
00:57:54,223 --> 00:57:56,091
- "Yellow"... - My goodness.

1818
00:57:56,583 --> 00:57:57,675
For goodness' sake.

1819
00:57:58,194 --> 00:58:00,452
"Blue Valentine", "Black".

1820
00:58:00,453 --> 00:58:01,823
"Black".

1821
00:58:01,824 --> 00:58:03,193
"Blue Valentine", "Anne of Green Gables",

1822
00:58:03,194 --> 00:58:04,562
"Blue", "Red", and "Black".

1823
00:58:04,563 --> 00:58:05,892
(In 5 seconds, name 5 movie titles with a color.)

1824
00:58:05,893 --> 00:58:07,903
(Ji Hyo succeeds first.)

1825
00:58:07,904 --> 00:58:10,363
How did this happen? How did this happen?

1826
00:58:10,364 --> 00:58:11,700
Ji Hyo did it.

1827
00:58:11,804 --> 00:58:13,673
Hurry up. Hurry up. Copy her answer.

1828
00:58:13,674 --> 00:58:15,503
"Anne of Green Gables",

1829
00:58:15,504 --> 00:58:18,166
"Blue", "Black", "Red"...

1830
00:58:18,243 --> 00:58:20,079
- Ji Hyo. - What was the last one?

1831
00:58:21,444 --> 00:58:22,483
I am sorry, Haha.

1832
00:58:22,484 --> 00:58:24,657
(I should have known.)

1833
00:58:25,313 --> 00:58:27,904
(The loser gets drenched in water.)

1834
00:58:28,453 --> 00:58:30,792
- It's a familiar look on Haha. - You must feel cool.

1835
00:58:30,793 --> 00:58:32,732
Haha's face turns that way when he gets drenched in water.

1836
00:58:33,024 --> 00:58:34,062
(The screenshots of all past videos look the same.)

1837
00:58:34,063 --> 00:58:36,722
The screenshots of all past videos would look the same.

1838
00:58:36,723 --> 00:58:37,916
Haha, I am sorry.

1839
00:58:38,293 --> 00:58:41,159
Thus, Team Jae Seok and Ji Hyo places first.

1840
00:58:41,864 --> 00:58:43,463
Congratulations. Congratulations.

1841
00:58:43,464 --> 00:58:45,233
- The second place isn't half bad. - Thank you.

1842
00:58:45,234 --> 00:58:46,872
So Min, I won't forget your help.

1843
00:58:46,873 --> 00:58:49,303
It's time to pick the land.

1844
00:58:49,304 --> 00:58:50,573
(It's time for the 1st and 2nd place to pick the land.)

1845
00:58:50,574 --> 00:58:52,673
I envy the first place.

1846
00:58:52,674 --> 00:58:54,113
Why don't you go first?

1847
00:58:54,114 --> 00:58:55,242
- Shall we do that? - Yes.

1848
00:58:55,243 --> 00:58:56,407
- All right. - Haha.

1849
00:58:56,614 --> 00:58:57,613
Let's go with that team.

1850
00:58:57,614 --> 00:58:58,983
(In that case...)

1851
00:58:58,984 --> 00:59:00,082
- That team? - Yes.

1852
00:59:00,083 --> 00:59:02,383
You shouldn't attack us.

1853
00:59:02,384 --> 00:59:03,812
If you attack us,

1854
00:59:03,853 --> 00:59:05,593
we will get back no matter what!

1855
00:59:05,594 --> 00:59:07,593
I bet they put two duds in one place...

1856
00:59:07,594 --> 00:59:09,222
unlike the others.

1857
00:59:09,223 --> 00:59:11,662
- We didn't do that. - We didn't do that.

1858
00:59:11,663 --> 00:59:13,562
(Did Kwang Soo and So Min put the duds in one slot?)

1859
00:59:13,563 --> 00:59:15,403
(When they distributed gold bars earlier,)

1860
00:59:15,404 --> 00:59:17,803
(they went all in.)

1861
00:59:17,804 --> 00:59:22,598
(They agreed to put nearly all gold bars in one slot.)

1862
00:59:22,973 --> 00:59:24,742
This is driving me crazy because they are risk-takers.

1863
00:59:24,743 --> 00:59:26,742
We won't stay still. We will retaliate.

1864
00:59:26,743 --> 00:59:28,142
- Let's go with number 6. - Number 6?

1865
00:59:28,143 --> 00:59:30,242
Shall we go with number six?

1866
00:59:30,243 --> 00:59:31,412
- Go ahead. - Go ahead.

1867
00:59:31,413 --> 00:59:33,087
- Shall we go with number one? - Go ahead.

1868
00:59:33,183 --> 00:59:34,478
- Number two? - Go ahead.

1869
00:59:34,484 --> 00:59:36,014
- How about number three? - Go ahead.

1870
00:59:36,183 --> 00:59:37,347
- How about number four? - Go ahead.

1871
00:59:38,493 --> 00:59:40,693
Okay. Let's go with number one. Her eyes shifted.

1872
00:59:40,694 --> 00:59:41,923
- Number one. - Are you sure?

1873
00:59:41,924 --> 00:59:42,944
Yes.

1874
00:59:43,123 --> 00:59:44,492
- Shall we go with number 5? - 5.

1875
00:59:44,493 --> 00:59:45,921
- Go ahead. - Four.

1876
00:59:45,964 --> 00:59:47,702
- Number 5. - Number 5.

1877
00:59:47,703 --> 00:59:49,363
Give them 30 dollars.

1878
00:59:49,364 --> 00:59:50,872
- Okay. - Give them 30 dollars.

1879
00:59:50,873 --> 00:59:52,573
Kwang Soo is happy.

1880
00:59:52,574 --> 00:59:54,602
Kwang Soo is happy. He can't wait to reveal it.

1881
00:59:54,603 --> 00:59:57,296
Let me reveal it right now.

1882
00:59:57,944 --> 00:59:59,142
It must be number one.

1883
00:59:59,143 --> 01:00:00,142
I got the money.

1884
01:00:00,143 --> 01:00:01,812
- Reveal number 5. In 1, 2, 3. - I will reveal it.

1885
01:00:01,813 --> 01:00:03,912
(If there are gold bars, Haha and Se Chan will beat them.)

1886
01:00:03,913 --> 01:00:07,283
(If there is a dud, they must give a gold bar to Kwang Soo and So Min.)

1887
01:00:07,284 --> 01:00:09,582
(What will be the result?)

1888
01:00:09,583 --> 01:00:12,193
(Haha and Se Chan get a dud.)

1889
01:00:12,194 --> 01:00:14,093
- A dud. - A dud.

1890
01:00:14,094 --> 01:00:16,236
(It's a dud.)

1891
01:00:16,663 --> 01:00:18,366
- It's a dud! - Give us a gold bar!

1892
01:00:19,094 --> 01:00:20,492
(Kwang Soo is the most excited.)

1893
01:00:20,493 --> 01:00:22,332
- Give them a gold bar. - My goodness.

1894
01:00:22,333 --> 01:00:23,602
(Although they placed 2nd, they lost money and a gold bar.)

1895
01:00:23,603 --> 01:00:25,003
- It's a dud. - What happens now?

1896
01:00:25,004 --> 01:00:26,602
- What? - Do we take this?

1897
01:00:26,603 --> 01:00:27,872
- We take this money and a gold bar. - Really?

1898
01:00:27,873 --> 01:00:29,003
That means we get 80 dollars.

1899
01:00:29,004 --> 01:00:30,003
(Kwang Soo and So Min get 30 dollars and 1 gold bar.)

1900
01:00:30,004 --> 01:00:32,472
- That's incredible. Thank you. - Thank you.

1901
01:00:32,473 --> 01:00:33,739
Thank you.

1902
01:00:34,043 --> 01:00:36,431
- Now, we will reveal two slots. - Yes.

1903
01:00:36,484 --> 01:00:37,637
You shouldn't pick us.

1904
01:00:38,013 --> 01:00:39,912
- We helped you. - We tried our best...

1905
01:00:39,913 --> 01:00:40,952
to help you.

1906
01:00:40,953 --> 01:00:43,352
I am certain they put all gold bars in one slot.

1907
01:00:43,353 --> 01:00:44,892
I recommend number one.

1908
01:00:44,893 --> 01:00:46,093
Ji Hyo thanked us.

1909
01:00:46,094 --> 01:00:48,193
- That's right. She did that. - Ji Hyo thanked us.

1910
01:00:48,194 --> 01:00:50,162
That's right. We are very thankful.

1911
01:00:50,964 --> 01:00:54,463
(The two teams had a deal before the game.)

1912
01:00:54,464 --> 01:00:58,202
(Jae Seok and Ji Hyo could place 1st thanks to their help.)

1913
01:00:58,203 --> 01:01:00,472
(You can trust me.)

1914
01:01:00,473 --> 01:01:02,573
Remember what happened 10 minutes ago.

1915
01:01:02,574 --> 01:01:03,972
- They lost a dud. - They lost a dud.

1916
01:01:03,973 --> 01:01:06,312
Even if we pick the slot with the other dud,

1917
01:01:06,313 --> 01:01:08,483
we have another chance to pick the slot with gold bars.

1918
01:01:08,484 --> 01:01:09,812
- That's right. - Ji Hyo.

1919
01:01:09,813 --> 01:01:11,113
The slot could be empty.

1920
01:01:11,114 --> 01:01:12,817
- That's right. - Yes. The slot could be empty.

1921
01:01:13,013 --> 01:01:14,823
But you still won't be a bum.

1922
01:01:14,824 --> 01:01:16,722
(But you still won't be a bum.)

1923
01:01:16,723 --> 01:01:17,823
"You still won't be a bum."

1924
01:01:17,824 --> 01:01:19,093
- "You still won't be a bum." - What?

1925
01:01:19,094 --> 01:01:20,859
- Use polite words. - Polite words.

1926
01:01:21,364 --> 01:01:22,892
You should've said, "You won't lose."

1927
01:01:22,893 --> 01:01:24,628
I can't think of a word.

1928
01:01:24,833 --> 01:01:27,108
What's another way of saying "You still won't be a bum."?

1929
01:01:27,194 --> 01:01:28,356
"You won't lose."

1930
01:01:28,364 --> 01:01:29,463
"You won't waste it."

1931
01:01:29,464 --> 01:01:30,484
(Haha knows it.)

1932
01:01:30,774 --> 01:01:32,702
Don't look them in the eye and take it off.

1933
01:01:32,703 --> 01:01:34,303
- You're paying for it. - It makes no sense.

1934
01:01:34,304 --> 01:01:37,073
If we don't do this, you'll help someone else.

1935
01:01:37,074 --> 01:01:38,196
- Number one. - Will we...

1936
01:01:38,313 --> 01:01:39,496
- Number one. - Us?

1937
01:01:40,243 --> 01:01:41,242
(Jae Seok and Ji Hyo pick number 1.)

1938
01:01:41,243 --> 01:01:42,783
- 10 dollars. - You have to pay 10 dollars.

1939
01:01:42,784 --> 01:01:44,912
- Us? - Do you mean us, Ji Hyo?

1940
01:01:44,913 --> 01:01:46,750
- Seriously? - I didn't expect...

1941
01:01:47,114 --> 01:01:49,093
Is Ji Hyo really doing this?

1942
01:01:50,254 --> 01:01:52,059
- Okay, okay. - Go.

1943
01:01:52,654 --> 01:01:54,423
Are you serious about ours?

1944
01:01:54,424 --> 01:01:55,923
- Ji Hyo. - We have no choice.

1945
01:01:55,924 --> 01:01:58,193
- Go, Ji Hyo. It's okay to get dud. - We will...

1946
01:01:58,194 --> 01:01:59,292
Go. 1, 2, 3.

1947
01:01:59,293 --> 01:02:04,709
(What's on land number 1?)

1948
01:02:06,274 --> 01:02:07,772
- It's empty. - There's nothing.

1949
01:02:09,203 --> 01:02:10,672
- There's nothing. - There's nothing.

1950
01:02:11,313 --> 01:02:13,047
They put them together.

1951
01:02:13,373 --> 01:02:14,742
Pick number two.

1952
01:02:14,743 --> 01:02:16,171
Pick number two.

1953
01:02:16,243 --> 01:02:18,053
- Stop it! - Stop it.

1954
01:02:18,054 --> 01:02:19,253
- Why? - Why are you bothering us?

1955
01:02:19,254 --> 01:02:21,059
Why is it only us?

1956
01:02:21,083 --> 01:02:23,182
- We don't have any power. - Change your mind.

1957
01:02:23,183 --> 01:02:24,923
We're in the last place anyway.

1958
01:02:24,924 --> 01:02:26,964
- We have no possibility. - Give us a chance.

1959
01:02:27,094 --> 01:02:28,144
It's only 10 dollars.

1960
01:02:28,364 --> 01:02:30,026
They definitely have a gold bar.

1961
01:02:30,163 --> 01:02:31,162
It's number two.

1962
01:02:31,163 --> 01:02:33,133
- We'll take revenge. - Please.

1963
01:02:33,134 --> 01:02:34,863
- If you take it off... - Jae Seok.

1964
01:02:34,864 --> 01:02:36,262
(If that's what you think...)

1965
01:02:36,263 --> 01:02:37,763
- I pick number two. - Okay.

1966
01:02:38,074 --> 01:02:39,503
(Jae Seok and Ji Hyo pick number 2.)

1967
01:02:39,504 --> 01:02:40,973
- Us? - That's enough.

1968
01:02:41,373 --> 01:02:43,005
Stop picking us.

1969
01:02:43,344 --> 01:02:44,512
I'll give you one last chance.

1970
01:02:44,513 --> 01:02:45,773
- Listen. - Number two.

1971
01:02:45,774 --> 01:02:46,895
- Number two? - Yes.

1972
01:02:47,784 --> 01:02:48,967
Take it off.

1973
01:02:49,413 --> 01:02:50,483
1, 2, 3.

1974
01:02:50,484 --> 01:02:55,828
(What's on land number 2?)

1975
01:02:56,754 --> 01:02:59,423
(They get one gold bar.)

1976
01:02:59,424 --> 01:03:01,023
- There it is. - There's one gold bar.

1977
01:03:01,024 --> 01:03:03,923
(Jae Seok and Ji Hyo win 1 gold bar.)

1978
01:03:03,924 --> 01:03:06,133
We got one.

1979
01:03:06,134 --> 01:03:07,562
Do they only have one?

1980
01:03:07,703 --> 01:03:10,458
- They put them together somewhere. - I wanted to get 20 dollars.

1981
01:03:10,534 --> 01:03:12,033
Their number 5, 6 are dud.

1982
01:03:12,404 --> 01:03:14,383
Let's win next time no matter what.

1983
01:03:14,404 --> 01:03:15,526
How?

1984
01:03:15,574 --> 01:03:17,273
- Let's go eat. - Okay.

1985
01:03:17,274 --> 01:03:19,042
- We can't even eat. - I know.

1986
01:03:19,043 --> 01:03:20,135
(They go to have a meal.)

1987
01:03:20,344 --> 01:03:25,514
(Each Team's Current Assets)

1988
01:03:25,554 --> 01:03:27,852
It looks so delicious.

1989
01:03:27,853 --> 01:03:30,283
- Thank you for the meal. - Thank you for the meal.

1990
01:03:30,284 --> 01:03:31,855
Thank you so much for the meal.

1991
01:03:32,453 --> 01:03:36,122
(He makes a wrap and takes a big bite.)

1992
01:03:36,123 --> 01:03:37,623
- It's delicious. - It's good.

1993
01:03:37,864 --> 01:03:39,934
- It's delicious here. - It smells good.

1994
01:03:40,094 --> 01:03:44,403
(Two teams that didn't clear the mission...)

1995
01:03:44,404 --> 01:03:45,403
(get rice and dried laver only.)

1996
01:03:45,404 --> 01:03:46,597
I'm hungry.

1997
01:03:47,574 --> 01:03:48,972
Can't we eat that?

1998
01:03:48,973 --> 01:03:50,142
It looks so delicious.

1999
01:03:50,143 --> 01:03:51,312
Thank you for the meal.

2000
01:03:51,313 --> 01:03:53,282
The soup looks good.

2001
01:03:54,284 --> 01:03:55,542
Kwang Soo, a wrap for five dollars.

2002
01:03:55,543 --> 01:03:57,852
(Kwang Soo, a wrap for five dollars.)

2003
01:03:57,853 --> 01:03:58,952
- Five dollars? - Yes.

2004
01:03:58,953 --> 01:04:00,553
- For how many? - It's too expensive.

2005
01:04:00,554 --> 01:04:02,359
How about 2 for 5 dollars?

2006
01:04:02,723 --> 01:04:03,753
One wrap each.

2007
01:04:03,754 --> 01:04:05,660
What? Thank you.

2008
01:04:05,824 --> 01:04:08,649
(While Se Chan tries to make money with meat,)

2009
01:04:08,864 --> 01:04:10,162
I want some too.

2010
01:04:10,163 --> 01:04:11,932
(Jae Seok gives them some meat.)

2011
01:04:11,933 --> 01:04:12,932
Thank you.

2012
01:04:12,933 --> 01:04:14,233
Shouldn't you make them pay?

2013
01:04:14,234 --> 01:04:16,262
We need to apologize to them.

2014
01:04:16,263 --> 01:04:18,073
(They're given two pieces of meat for free.)

2015
01:04:18,074 --> 01:04:20,173
(Stealthily)

2016
01:04:20,174 --> 01:04:21,632
(He takes it in one bite.)

2017
01:04:22,103 --> 01:04:25,642
(He's an old hyena who steals the youngest members' food.)

2018
01:04:25,643 --> 01:04:27,307
(He's unbelievable.)

2019
01:04:28,714 --> 01:04:30,912
I'm not kidding.

2020
01:04:30,913 --> 01:04:32,113
I want to put my hand in his mouth,

2021
01:04:32,114 --> 01:04:33,182
but I'm afraid that I'll pull out his tooth.

2022
01:04:33,183 --> 01:04:35,283
(I'm afraid that I'll pull out his tooth.)

2023
01:04:35,284 --> 01:04:36,923
- Be careful. - Hey.

2024
01:04:36,924 --> 01:04:38,792
- Seok Jin should be careful. - Hey.

2025
01:04:38,793 --> 01:04:39,952
(Her words hurt him.)

2026
01:04:39,953 --> 01:04:41,830
When I had a dog,

2027
01:04:42,123 --> 01:04:43,826
he lost his teeth.

2028
01:04:43,924 --> 01:04:45,830
When I touched them, they felt like artificial teeth.

2029
01:04:45,993 --> 01:04:47,360
They're hard.

2030
01:04:47,393 --> 01:04:48,633
For two dollars.

2031
01:04:48,634 --> 01:04:49,733
- What? - A big piece for two dollars.

2032
01:04:49,734 --> 01:04:50,803
This big one, Seok Jin.

2033
01:04:50,804 --> 01:04:52,303
- How much? - It's five dollars.

2034
01:04:52,873 --> 01:04:54,505
It was 5 dollars, but now it's 3 dollars.

2035
01:04:54,574 --> 01:04:56,614
- It's only for now. - You have to take this chance.

2036
01:04:56,643 --> 01:04:58,040
Give me one more.

2037
01:04:58,774 --> 01:04:59,936
I'll pay five dollars.

2038
01:04:59,973 --> 01:05:02,082
- 2 for 5 dollars. - Okay, okay.

2039
01:05:02,083 --> 01:05:03,338
Seok Jin.

2040
01:05:03,413 --> 01:05:05,218
Why are you making all the deals?

2041
01:05:05,853 --> 01:05:07,553
2 big pieces for 5 dollars? Okay.

2042
01:05:07,554 --> 01:05:08,981
Seok Jin, it's not okay.

2043
01:05:09,223 --> 01:05:10,283
It's my money.

2044
01:05:10,284 --> 01:05:12,496
(He announces his financial independence.)

2045
01:05:13,094 --> 01:05:15,001
- Hey. - You just said it was your money.

2046
01:05:15,864 --> 01:05:17,322
You said that it was your money.

2047
01:05:17,393 --> 01:05:18,893
- Five dollars. It's mine. - Okay.

2048
01:05:18,933 --> 01:05:20,363
- 5 dollars? - 5 dollars.

2049
01:05:20,364 --> 01:05:22,343
- We'll add it. - We got five dollars.

2050
01:05:22,504 --> 01:05:25,303
(Just then...)

2051
01:05:25,304 --> 01:05:29,142
(Kwang Soo takes meat away from Seok Jin.)

2052
01:05:29,143 --> 01:05:32,673
(He steals Seok Jin's meat for stealing his meat.)

2053
01:05:32,674 --> 01:05:35,213
He took it.

2054
01:05:35,214 --> 01:05:36,407
We got his money.

2055
01:05:37,083 --> 01:05:38,888
Spit it out.

2056
01:05:38,984 --> 01:05:40,717
Seok Jin lost.

2057
01:05:41,223 --> 01:05:42,283
- You should'be been careful. - It's really good.

2058
01:05:42,284 --> 01:05:43,923
You should have handed to me.

2059
01:05:43,924 --> 01:05:45,422
I did.

2060
01:05:45,694 --> 01:05:46,722
- I gave it to you. - It's so delicious.

2061
01:05:46,723 --> 01:05:47,762
You should have come near me.

2062
01:05:47,763 --> 01:05:49,252
Thanks to you, I had meat that he dropped.

2063
01:05:49,324 --> 01:05:50,423
Did you eat some?

2064
01:05:50,424 --> 01:05:51,593
It's so delicious.

2065
01:05:51,594 --> 01:05:53,762
(While they were fighting over the meat,)

2066
01:05:53,763 --> 01:05:57,233
(Seok Jin dropped a piece of meat.)

2067
01:05:57,234 --> 01:06:00,573
(She picks up meat that falls from the sky.)

2068
01:06:00,574 --> 01:06:02,773
(She eats it.)

2069
01:06:02,774 --> 01:06:05,497
(She gains unexpected meat.)

2070
01:06:06,043 --> 01:06:07,472
- Where's the other half of my meat? - It's delicious.

2071
01:06:07,473 --> 01:06:08,810
- I ate it. - It's delicious.

2072
01:06:09,984 --> 01:06:11,582
(He can't say anything because he stole hers.)

2073
01:06:11,583 --> 01:06:12,783
It's delicious.

2074
01:06:12,784 --> 01:06:13,936
It's very delicious.

2075
01:06:14,013 --> 01:06:15,153
- It's very good. - I know.

2076
01:06:15,154 --> 01:06:16,174
(He lost 5 dollars.)

2077
01:06:16,284 --> 01:06:17,925
This is two dollars, Seok Jin.

2078
01:06:19,024 --> 01:06:21,122
Do you want to pay 10 dollars with other things?

2079
01:06:21,123 --> 01:06:22,762
I need to keep a few dollars,

2080
01:06:22,763 --> 01:06:23,892
or Jong Kook will scold me.

2081
01:06:23,893 --> 01:06:25,362
(If I spend all the money, Jong Kook will scold me.)

2082
01:06:25,393 --> 01:06:26,964
10 dollars are yours, anyway.

2083
01:06:27,194 --> 01:06:29,233
- Do you want it for 10 dollars? - Show me a 3-dollar one.

2084
01:06:29,234 --> 01:06:31,111
- Okay. - How much is it for three dollars?

2085
01:06:31,134 --> 01:06:32,303
We're sharing the food,

2086
01:06:32,304 --> 01:06:33,702
you can't decide to give that much on your own.

2087
01:06:33,703 --> 01:06:34,903
Make it a wrap.

2088
01:06:34,904 --> 01:06:36,066
It's a lot.

2089
01:06:36,344 --> 01:06:37,364
It looks good.

2090
01:06:37,973 --> 01:06:39,213
- Kwang Soo. - Add some rice.

2091
01:06:39,214 --> 01:06:40,412
Kwang Soo seems to be experiencing the farm hardship period.

2092
01:06:40,413 --> 01:06:42,383
He keeps eating rice while looking over there.

2093
01:06:42,384 --> 01:06:44,653
(Kwang Soo is experiencing the farm hardship period.)

2094
01:06:44,654 --> 01:06:46,582
- He's looking over there. - I'm okay.

2095
01:06:46,583 --> 01:06:47,777
He's looking over there.

2096
01:06:47,984 --> 01:06:49,514
I'll put this on top.

2097
01:06:49,953 --> 01:06:51,045
How much is it?

2098
01:06:51,293 --> 01:06:53,130
- This is a bargain sale. - How much is it?

2099
01:06:53,293 --> 01:06:55,423
- It's 2.5 dollars. - How about 2 dollars?

2100
01:06:55,424 --> 01:06:56,523
No, it should be 2.5 dollars.

2101
01:06:56,524 --> 01:06:58,162
Why additional 50 cents?

2102
01:06:58,163 --> 01:06:59,561
- It's 3 dollars. - 3 dollars.

2103
01:06:59,594 --> 01:07:00,633
- How about 2 dollars? - 2 dollars?

2104
01:07:00,634 --> 01:07:02,234
- Is there four pieces? - Hurry up.

2105
01:07:02,304 --> 01:07:03,354
Deduct two dollars from my money.

2106
01:07:03,464 --> 01:07:04,573
- It's too expensive. - Two dollars.

2107
01:07:04,574 --> 01:07:05,972
- How much is it? - Two dollars.

2108
01:07:05,973 --> 01:07:08,502
Don't you need permission from Jong Kook?

2109
01:07:08,503 --> 01:07:09,642
It's my money.

2110
01:07:09,643 --> 01:07:10,929
- It's his money. - It's okay.

2111
01:07:11,003 --> 01:07:12,269
Do you keep your money separately?

2112
01:07:12,274 --> 01:07:13,538
We decided to keep it separately.

2113
01:07:13,574 --> 01:07:14,613
We do.

2114
01:07:14,614 --> 01:07:16,413
Can you give me a wrap?

2115
01:07:16,414 --> 01:07:18,083
I mean doenjang.

2116
01:07:18,084 --> 01:07:19,182
Doenjang is four dollars.

2117
01:07:19,183 --> 01:07:20,852
(You're a pushover.)

2118
01:07:20,853 --> 01:07:22,623
- Hey. - It's not good without doenjang.

2119
01:07:22,624 --> 01:07:23,722
I'm serious.

2120
01:07:23,723 --> 01:07:24,752
That's nonsense.

2121
01:07:24,753 --> 01:07:26,722
- Doenjang makes a huge difference. - It's important.

2122
01:07:26,723 --> 01:07:28,092
- Seok Jin, the taste is different. - It has no taste without doenjang.

2123
01:07:28,093 --> 01:07:29,222
Doenjang is good by itself.

2124
01:07:29,223 --> 01:07:30,284
That's true.

2125
01:07:30,763 --> 01:07:31,916
How about one dollar?

2126
01:07:32,234 --> 01:07:34,171
I'll buy it for a dollar.

2127
01:07:34,864 --> 01:07:35,863
- A dollar? - Are you a regular customer?

2128
01:07:35,864 --> 01:07:37,062
- Yes. - I'll give it for 1.5 dollars.

2129
01:07:37,063 --> 01:07:39,787
- How about 1 dollar? - I need to keep two dollars.

2130
01:07:39,834 --> 01:07:41,342
- You get one dip. - Okay.

2131
01:07:41,343 --> 01:07:42,496
- Okay. - For a dollar.

2132
01:07:43,244 --> 01:07:45,558
It's so cheap.

2133
01:07:45,614 --> 01:07:46,913
- It'll be salty. - Did you dip it?

2134
01:07:46,914 --> 01:07:48,821
- Salt isn't good for your health. - He took a lot.

2135
01:07:48,883 --> 01:07:50,583
Can we get more doenjang please?

2136
01:07:50,584 --> 01:07:53,083
(Can we get more doenjang please?)

2137
01:07:53,084 --> 01:07:54,983
(Goodness)

2138
01:07:54,984 --> 01:07:56,182
I could have asked for more doenjang like him.

2139
01:07:56,183 --> 01:07:58,352
(Gosh)

2140
01:07:58,353 --> 01:08:00,464
Hey, hey!

2141
01:08:01,923 --> 01:08:04,833
(Kwang Soo steals Seok Jin's meat again for the second time.)

2142
01:08:04,834 --> 01:08:06,905
(She picks up Seok Jin's meat again.)

2143
01:08:07,963 --> 01:08:09,962
(Stealing becomes fun.)

2144
01:08:09,963 --> 01:08:12,044
(Kwang Soo steals Seok Jin's meat consecutively.)

2145
01:08:12,274 --> 01:08:13,733
(The elderly wails.)

2146
01:08:13,734 --> 01:08:15,028
Hey.

2147
01:08:15,343 --> 01:08:16,873
He's very upset.

2148
01:08:16,874 --> 01:08:18,043
(Onlookers are having fun.)

2149
01:08:18,044 --> 01:08:19,312
I got some meat again.

2150
01:08:19,313 --> 01:08:21,073
- I never imagined he'd do it again. - It's great how you drop it.

2151
01:08:21,074 --> 01:08:22,543
What? Did I drop some?

2152
01:08:22,544 --> 01:08:23,842
- Yes, I ate it. - It's delicious.

2153
01:08:23,843 --> 01:08:25,012
I never imagined he'd do it again.

2154
01:08:25,013 --> 01:08:26,182
- It's delicious. - I'm full.

2155
01:08:26,183 --> 01:08:27,413
I'm full too. I finished the meat.

2156
01:08:27,414 --> 01:08:29,752
- Thank you, Seok Jin. - Thank you.

2157
01:08:29,753 --> 01:08:30,783
(Thank you for the food, Seok Jin.)

2158
01:08:30,784 --> 01:08:33,222
He yields to others.

2159
01:08:33,223 --> 01:08:35,029
- He's a great man. - He really is.

2160
01:08:35,923 --> 01:08:37,363
How about a big wrap for two dollars?

2161
01:08:37,364 --> 01:08:39,193
(He's obsessed.)

2162
01:08:39,194 --> 01:08:41,275
- That sounds good. - A big wrap for two dollars.

2163
01:08:41,534 --> 01:08:45,002
(He makes a wrap for 2 dollars.)

2164
01:08:45,003 --> 01:08:47,002
- This is upsetting. - I put doenjang in it.

2165
01:08:47,003 --> 01:08:48,809
- Seok Jin, it's 2 dollars. - 2 dollars?

2166
01:08:48,973 --> 01:08:51,217
- Two dollars. Did you add meat? - Yes.

2167
01:08:51,574 --> 01:08:53,212
- If not, don't take it. - Okay.

2168
01:08:53,213 --> 01:08:54,775
- Let me see the meat. - Here's the meat.

2169
01:08:54,914 --> 01:08:56,821
Should I keep my two dollars, Jong Kook?

2170
01:08:57,183 --> 01:08:59,312
Don't ask me. It's your life.

2171
01:08:59,313 --> 01:09:01,752
(He rejects.)

2172
01:09:01,753 --> 01:09:03,823
(The teammates become unfriendly as Seok Jin bought wraps.)

2173
01:09:03,824 --> 01:09:05,052
- He is sullen. - I know.

2174
01:09:05,053 --> 01:09:06,349
Jong Kook's mind has already turned away.

2175
01:09:06,393 --> 01:09:07,679
Since I feel bad for you, I'll add this.

2176
01:09:07,963 --> 01:09:09,062
- 2 dollars? - 2 dollars?

2177
01:09:09,063 --> 01:09:11,293
5, 4, 3, 2, 1.

2178
01:09:11,294 --> 01:09:13,375
- Deal! - Okay.

2179
01:09:14,093 --> 01:09:16,132
You still have a gold bar.

2180
01:09:16,133 --> 01:09:17,490
We have a gold bar that costs 50 dollars.

2181
01:09:18,003 --> 01:09:19,769
(Sudden attack)

2182
01:09:20,133 --> 01:09:23,743
(The thief makes a sudden attack.)

2183
01:09:23,744 --> 01:09:25,773
(Slapping)

2184
01:09:25,774 --> 01:09:28,283
(Seok Jin slaps Kwang Soo with a wrap.)

2185
01:09:28,284 --> 01:09:31,812
(Seok Jin explodes by slapping him with a wrap.)

2186
01:09:31,813 --> 01:09:33,283
(Eating)

2187
01:09:33,284 --> 01:09:35,182
Don't eat it. It's fish cake.

2188
01:09:35,183 --> 01:09:36,752
(Kwang Soo, it's fish cake.)

2189
01:09:36,753 --> 01:09:38,552
(He gets a fish cake wrap after getting slapped.)

2190
01:09:38,553 --> 01:09:40,852
Kwang Soo got ugly when he stole and ate it.

2191
01:09:40,853 --> 01:09:41,985
(He feels bitter.)

2192
01:09:42,194 --> 01:09:43,592
I never saw a lettuce slap.

2193
01:09:43,593 --> 01:09:44,889
I thought I was watching a morning soap opera.

2194
01:09:45,534 --> 01:09:47,262
(A water slap)

2195
01:09:47,263 --> 01:09:48,932
(A kimchi slap)

2196
01:09:48,933 --> 01:09:51,102
(A wrap slap)

2197
01:09:51,103 --> 01:09:52,403
How are you eating it?

2198
01:09:52,404 --> 01:09:55,472
(He's a rising star in soap operas.)

2199
01:09:55,473 --> 01:09:56,703
Look at the rice on his face.

2200
01:09:56,704 --> 01:09:58,873
(They finish a battle of revenge.)

2201
01:09:58,874 --> 01:10:00,709
Most of us are...

2202
01:10:01,313 --> 01:10:03,083
sitting with teammates.

2203
01:10:03,084 --> 01:10:05,562
However, Seok Jin insisted on sitting this seat.

2204
01:10:06,253 --> 01:10:08,052
(Seok Jin, Jong Kook, Jae Seok, and Ji Hyo sit separately...)

2205
01:10:08,053 --> 01:10:09,252
(as Seok Jin insists on his seat.)

2206
01:10:09,253 --> 01:10:10,352
Can you film this?

2207
01:10:10,353 --> 01:10:13,077
- He gets in my space. - He's a mess.

2208
01:10:13,154 --> 01:10:14,552
Scoot over.

2209
01:10:14,553 --> 01:10:16,762
It's such a mess today because of Seok Jin.

2210
01:10:16,763 --> 01:10:18,693
I don't want to lose to this team. They can't work as a team.

2211
01:10:18,694 --> 01:10:21,193
We're sitting separately because of Seok Jin.

2212
01:10:21,194 --> 01:10:23,407
Why don't you two exchange seats?

2213
01:10:23,433 --> 01:10:24,462
Don't you know?

2214
01:10:24,463 --> 01:10:26,233
This has been my seat. I lean to the right.

2215
01:10:26,234 --> 01:10:28,002
Why? Why is it your seat?

2216
01:10:28,003 --> 01:10:29,228
Tell us now.

2217
01:10:29,303 --> 01:10:30,943
Say it to the viewers. Why is it your seat?

2218
01:10:30,944 --> 01:10:33,073
- "Say it to the viewers". - Say it.

2219
01:10:33,074 --> 01:10:36,882
The viewers don't care whether I sit here or there.

2220
01:10:36,883 --> 01:10:39,113
- Why is it your seat? - Why are you obsessed?

2221
01:10:39,114 --> 01:10:40,613
- Tell us. - I feel suffocated.

2222
01:10:40,683 --> 01:10:42,382
Why do you have to sit here?

2223
01:10:42,383 --> 01:10:44,592
I notice that Seok Jin is...

2224
01:10:44,593 --> 01:10:45,993
arguing with four people.

2225
01:10:45,994 --> 01:10:47,625
(Seok Jin is arguing with 4 people.)

2226
01:10:48,164 --> 01:10:49,262
This is funny.

2227
01:10:49,263 --> 01:10:50,592
- He's arguing with four. - I just want to sit here.

2228
01:10:50,593 --> 01:10:52,500
What if I want to sit here? I want to.

2229
01:10:53,133 --> 01:10:54,262
Then take it first.

2230
01:10:54,263 --> 01:10:55,733
(He's being childish.)

2231
01:10:55,734 --> 01:10:57,002
That's childish.

2232
01:10:57,003 --> 01:10:58,373
It's so childish.

2233
01:10:58,374 --> 01:10:59,833
- Can I sit if I take it first? - Yes.

2234
01:10:59,834 --> 01:11:00,932
Okay.

2235
01:11:00,933 --> 01:11:02,443
Take it first.

2236
01:11:02,444 --> 01:11:04,514
This is why after the shoot,

2237
01:11:04,774 --> 01:11:06,443
- He becomes tired. - Seok Jin is very tired.

2238
01:11:06,444 --> 01:11:09,064
When I go home after the shoot,

2239
01:11:09,084 --> 01:11:10,951
I get annoyed with my wife over nothing.

2240
01:11:11,683 --> 01:11:12,939
That's because I get upset from the shoot and tired.

2241
01:11:13,284 --> 01:11:15,283
- You shouldn't do that. - Jong Kook is right.

2242
01:11:15,284 --> 01:11:18,092
You should give her a hug and cry.

2243
01:11:18,093 --> 01:11:19,653
It's because he gets very stressed out.

2244
01:11:19,654 --> 01:11:22,724
When she asks me twice if I have eaten, I get annoyed.

2245
01:11:23,393 --> 01:11:24,693
- Then, I go, "I ate." - He's mean.

2246
01:11:24,694 --> 01:11:26,062
"I said that I ate."

2247
01:11:26,063 --> 01:11:27,163
He causes family discord.

2248
01:11:27,164 --> 01:11:28,388
Then, my wife says, "Why are you annoyed?"

2249
01:11:29,003 --> 01:11:30,333
And I have to say, "I'm sorry."

2250
01:11:30,334 --> 01:11:32,802
(He apologizes immediately.)

2251
01:11:32,803 --> 01:11:34,609
That's because of work.

2252
01:11:34,774 --> 01:11:36,773
- Seok Jin is stressed out. - I'm sorry that...

2253
01:11:36,774 --> 01:11:39,512
I got stressed out from work.

2254
01:11:39,513 --> 01:11:41,583
For the first time, I want to help him.

2255
01:11:41,584 --> 01:11:43,212
I wanted to sympathize with him.

2256
01:11:43,213 --> 01:11:44,783
You could just say, "Let me sit here."

2257
01:11:44,784 --> 01:11:45,882
Then we'd say,

2258
01:11:45,883 --> 01:11:47,682
"Go ahead. You can sit here."

2259
01:11:47,683 --> 01:11:49,422
That's not it.

2260
01:11:49,423 --> 01:11:51,699
- You can take this seat first... - Ask each of us kindly.

2261
01:11:51,923 --> 01:11:53,592
Ask all the members.

2262
01:11:53,593 --> 01:11:55,993
Say, "I like to sit by myself."

2263
01:11:55,994 --> 01:11:57,421
- "Let me sit here." - I'm the eldest.

2264
01:11:58,694 --> 01:12:00,592
You have a lot of chances to sit here.

2265
01:12:00,593 --> 01:12:03,363
(You guys are still young.)

2266
01:12:03,364 --> 01:12:05,342
Don't say that.

2267
01:12:06,374 --> 01:12:07,373
(The youngsters feel bad for him being weak and vulnerable.)

2268
01:12:07,374 --> 01:12:08,403
What's wrong with you?

2269
01:12:08,404 --> 01:12:11,102
- Did you abandon your pride? - What's wrong?

2270
01:12:11,103 --> 01:12:12,312
If possible...

2271
01:12:12,313 --> 01:12:13,613
(The whole group gets sad.)

2272
01:12:13,614 --> 01:12:15,043
Ji Hyo.

2273
01:12:15,044 --> 01:12:16,512
I'm getting tears in my eyes.

2274
01:12:16,513 --> 01:12:17,842
Tears, my foot.

2275
01:12:17,843 --> 01:12:21,076
(He changes completely.)

2276
01:12:21,853 --> 01:12:23,182
(Why are you being mean to Ji Hyo?)

2277
01:12:23,183 --> 01:12:24,352
What's wrong with you?

2278
01:12:24,353 --> 01:12:26,693
- Why are you being mean to Ji Hyo? - Why?

2279
01:12:26,694 --> 01:12:28,262
Why are you being so mean to her?

2280
01:12:28,263 --> 01:12:29,722
- Just go home if you keep this up. - When you're at home,

2281
01:12:29,723 --> 01:12:32,333
- do you act like that? - Why are you being mean to Ji Hyo?

2282
01:12:32,334 --> 01:12:35,132
- Don't take it out on me. - She didn't do anything wrong.

2283
01:12:35,133 --> 01:12:36,733
You were faking it.

2284
01:12:36,734 --> 01:12:37,863
Don't do that to Ji Hyo.

2285
01:12:37,864 --> 01:12:39,073
- I got emotional. - It makes no sense...

2286
01:12:39,074 --> 01:12:42,302
- that you would cry for me. - Seriously.

2287
01:12:42,303 --> 01:12:43,943
That was so fake.

2288
01:12:43,944 --> 01:12:46,642
Saying that you're getting tears was going overboard.

2289
01:12:46,643 --> 01:12:47,972
(They arrive at the second mission spot.)

2290
01:12:47,973 --> 01:12:50,342
- Weren't we here before? - Right.

2291
01:12:50,343 --> 01:12:51,577
That's right.

2292
01:12:51,883 --> 01:12:53,750
We have to win no matter what.

2293
01:12:54,584 --> 01:12:56,083
We have to win.

2294
01:12:56,084 --> 01:12:57,409
- No matter what. - Otherwise...

2295
01:12:57,524 --> 01:12:58,717
We have to.

2296
01:12:58,753 --> 01:13:00,052
Something is waiting for us.

2297
01:13:00,053 --> 01:13:01,727
I think a variety of missions awaits us.

2298
01:13:02,664 --> 01:13:04,422
(Running Man, the variety show.)

2299
01:13:04,423 --> 01:13:07,320
(They stop Let's Make Merchandise Race for a while.)

2300
01:13:07,894 --> 01:13:09,633
(A week later, at a dance studio in Gangnam)

2301
01:13:09,634 --> 01:13:11,702
Isn't this place...

2302
01:13:11,703 --> 01:13:14,572
- It's a famous place. - I saw it often online.

2303
01:13:14,573 --> 01:13:15,843
- This place? - Is this the place?

2304
01:13:15,844 --> 01:13:17,103
Is this place famous?

2305
01:13:17,104 --> 01:13:19,542
People watch from the outside.

2306
01:13:19,543 --> 01:13:20,773
(This is the spot in a famous dance video.)

2307
01:13:20,774 --> 01:13:22,683
People were cheering.

2308
01:13:22,684 --> 01:13:24,383
People were dancing in here.

2309
01:13:24,384 --> 01:13:26,212
- Is that so? - Is this the place?

2310
01:13:26,213 --> 01:13:27,252
There was also a teacher.

2311
01:13:27,253 --> 01:13:28,344
It's a famous place.

2312
01:13:28,854 --> 01:13:33,593
All the people who teach us how to dance...

2313
01:13:33,594 --> 01:13:35,322
are the top instructors in Korea.

2314
01:13:35,323 --> 01:13:36,446
That's right.

2315
01:13:36,564 --> 01:13:38,593
They're also famous internationally.

2316
01:13:38,594 --> 01:13:40,063
- They must be. - J Black.

2317
01:13:40,064 --> 01:13:41,433
That's right.

2318
01:13:41,434 --> 01:13:43,433
There was also MMARY.

2319
01:13:43,434 --> 01:13:44,803
- They're the best. - Right.

2320
01:13:44,804 --> 01:13:46,603
Teaching us is probably a challenge for them.

2321
01:13:46,604 --> 01:13:49,202
Some instructors couldn't finish teaching us.

2322
01:13:49,203 --> 01:13:50,242
(Some instructors couldn't finish teaching us.)

2323
01:13:50,243 --> 01:13:52,513
I won't specify who, but some of them left...

2324
01:13:52,514 --> 01:13:54,513
without finishing their lesson.

2325
01:13:54,514 --> 01:13:55,843
It's an obstacle they must overcome.

2326
01:13:55,844 --> 01:13:57,643
- Won't you tell who they are? - I won't.

2327
01:13:57,644 --> 01:14:00,813
Even the top instructors...

2328
01:14:00,814 --> 01:14:02,211
They ignored me...

2329
01:14:02,323 --> 01:14:03,652
a few times.

2330
01:14:03,653 --> 01:14:05,723
- Are you good? - They left.

2331
01:14:05,724 --> 01:14:07,723
(Are you good?)

2332
01:14:07,724 --> 01:14:09,193
He didn't say who it was.

2333
01:14:09,194 --> 01:14:10,563
- Does he dance well? - Why are you getting angry?

2334
01:14:10,564 --> 01:14:12,604
To be honest, Jae Seok is...

2335
01:14:13,163 --> 01:14:14,862
- part of our group. - That's nonsense.

2336
01:14:14,863 --> 01:14:16,536
- That's right. - He's one of us.

2337
01:14:16,734 --> 01:14:18,032
I approve of him.

2338
01:14:18,033 --> 01:14:19,072
I approve of Jae Seok.

2339
01:14:19,073 --> 01:14:20,273
(I agree.)

2340
01:14:20,274 --> 01:14:21,843
- You can even do the insider dance. - Yes.

2341
01:14:21,844 --> 01:14:23,303
I can do many dances.

2342
01:14:23,674 --> 01:14:26,224
- Can you do the hipster dance? - 1, 2, 3, 4.

2343
01:14:26,814 --> 01:14:28,082
Look. He's very good.

2344
01:14:28,083 --> 01:14:31,042
(His feet movement is fancy.)

2345
01:14:31,043 --> 01:14:32,053
He can do it.

2346
01:14:32,054 --> 01:14:33,818
(An audience member interrupts.)

2347
01:14:34,354 --> 01:14:35,582
Come on, Seok Jin.

2348
01:14:35,583 --> 01:14:38,103
(What is this all of a sudden?)

2349
01:14:38,293 --> 01:14:39,322
(People freeze.)

2350
01:14:39,323 --> 01:14:40,721
- Come back in. - "Fire"?

2351
01:14:40,993 --> 01:14:42,626
He gave me the creeps.

2352
01:14:43,293 --> 01:14:45,099
When he started dancing, that creeped me out.

2353
01:14:45,533 --> 01:14:47,472
Wait, Seok Jin.

2354
01:14:48,104 --> 01:14:50,862
(BTS Old Men's Group Dinner Show)

2355
01:14:50,863 --> 01:14:52,433
- Isn't he a zombie? - Zombie?

2356
01:14:52,434 --> 01:14:53,973
Ji Hyo said you looked like a zombie.

2357
01:14:53,974 --> 01:14:55,637
Isn't he a zombie?

2358
01:14:56,144 --> 01:14:57,143
It's scary.

2359
01:14:57,144 --> 01:15:00,071
It's nice that he can move like this.

2360
01:15:01,043 --> 01:15:02,082
Goodness.

2361
01:15:02,083 --> 01:15:05,152
Regarding the group choreography,

2362
01:15:05,153 --> 01:15:08,041
- we defeated the staff. - Yes.

2363
01:15:08,984 --> 01:15:10,223
Let's go.

2364
01:15:10,224 --> 01:15:11,952
(In the competition against the staff,)

2365
01:15:11,953 --> 01:15:15,330
(Running Man members won dramatically.)

2366
01:15:17,024 --> 01:15:19,162
(Instead of the difficult choreography,)

2367
01:15:19,163 --> 01:15:22,774
(Running Man can prepare choreography that they want.)

2368
01:15:24,104 --> 01:15:26,173
(They want fun dance...)

2369
01:15:26,174 --> 01:15:28,316
(with a fast beat like Celeb Five's performance.)

2370
01:15:28,844 --> 01:15:31,513
(Please make a fun dance for us.)

2371
01:15:31,514 --> 01:15:33,112
Just like what you asked,

2372
01:15:33,113 --> 01:15:35,612
we asked the instructor to create a dance like Celeb Five's.

2373
01:15:35,613 --> 01:15:36,912
- Okay. - Did she?

2374
01:15:36,913 --> 01:15:39,782
The instructor choreographed dance to the music.

2375
01:15:39,783 --> 01:15:40,813
Is it done?

2376
01:15:40,814 --> 01:15:43,723
We'll invite the instructor now.

2377
01:15:43,724 --> 01:15:47,393
She's a globally popular dancer.

2378
01:15:47,394 --> 01:15:49,771
Here is Instructor Lia Kim.

2379
01:15:50,194 --> 01:15:51,633
We meet her in person.

2380
01:15:51,634 --> 01:15:52,960
Lia Kim.

2381
01:15:53,033 --> 01:15:54,362
Hello.

2382
01:15:54,363 --> 01:15:58,179
(She's the chief choreographer at 1Million Dance Studio.)

2383
01:15:59,104 --> 01:16:02,072
(She's good at popping.)

2384
01:16:02,073 --> 01:16:04,592
(She's a good dancer.)

2385
01:16:05,814 --> 01:16:09,148
(She dances all genres.)

2386
01:16:09,844 --> 01:16:12,082
(Her social network subscribers are over 12 million.)

2387
01:16:12,083 --> 01:16:15,491
(Globally popular choreographer)

2388
01:16:17,054 --> 01:16:21,962
She's choreographed dances all over the world.

2389
01:16:21,963 --> 01:16:23,862
I'll introduce her briefly.

2390
01:16:23,863 --> 01:16:26,093
Some people might not know.

2391
01:16:26,094 --> 01:16:27,393
- Seok Jin. - Yes?

2392
01:16:27,394 --> 01:16:29,679
Don't look at me suspiciously.

2393
01:16:30,434 --> 01:16:32,202
(He's full of distrust.)

2394
01:16:32,203 --> 01:16:33,773
Why do you suspect me when I said she's popular in many countries?

2395
01:16:33,774 --> 01:16:35,643
I don't know her well.

2396
01:16:35,644 --> 01:16:37,572
- I know that she's very famous. - I don't know...

2397
01:16:37,573 --> 01:16:40,513
- I heard that she's famous. - People line up for her.

2398
01:16:40,514 --> 01:16:43,843
- Not anyone can learn from her. - To learn from her,

2399
01:16:43,844 --> 01:16:45,452
you must line up.

2400
01:16:45,453 --> 01:16:47,902
She's famous for slapping her students if you don't dance well.

2401
01:16:48,554 --> 01:16:50,082
(I don't slap.)

2402
01:16:50,083 --> 01:16:53,723
Do you think that I'm a fool?

2403
01:16:53,724 --> 01:16:54,853
She does it while dancing.

2404
01:16:54,854 --> 01:16:55,945
In the middle of dancing.

2405
01:16:56,424 --> 01:16:58,362
She dances...

2406
01:16:58,363 --> 01:17:01,962
popping, modern dance, hip hop, locking, and classical dance.

2407
01:17:01,963 --> 01:17:04,687
She's one of the few dancers of all genres in Korea.

2408
01:17:05,934 --> 01:17:07,331
- She can do all. - Respect.

2409
01:17:08,003 --> 01:17:10,443
Let me tell about her achievements. This will catch your attention.

2410
01:17:10,444 --> 01:17:12,572
- "Gashina" by SUNMI. - "Gashina"?

2411
01:17:12,573 --> 01:17:14,572
"TT" and "Like OOH-AHH" by TWICE.

2412
01:17:14,573 --> 01:17:16,042
Did she create this?

2413
01:17:16,043 --> 01:17:17,313
"Very Very Very" by I.O.I.

2414
01:17:17,314 --> 01:17:19,212
- Very, very, very - You know this song, right?

2415
01:17:19,213 --> 01:17:21,112
"Fox" by BoA,

2416
01:17:21,113 --> 01:17:23,296
and "I Feel You" by Wonder Girls.

2417
01:17:23,924 --> 01:17:28,622
She created dances for many songs.

2418
01:17:28,623 --> 01:17:30,992
Will Running Man be part of her work experience?

2419
01:17:30,993 --> 01:17:32,157
That's right.

2420
01:17:32,694 --> 01:17:33,962
That's the best work experience.

2421
01:17:33,963 --> 01:17:34,962
It's the best.

2422
01:17:34,963 --> 01:17:39,665
Teaching us could be her first crisis in her career.

2423
01:17:40,203 --> 01:17:41,233
It could be her first crisis in her career.

2424
01:17:41,234 --> 01:17:42,303
(She's worried.)

2425
01:17:42,304 --> 01:17:43,973
You must overcome it...

2426
01:17:43,974 --> 01:17:46,343
- That's right. - to enter a whole new level.

2427
01:17:46,344 --> 01:17:48,412
She prepared a choreography...

2428
01:17:48,413 --> 01:17:50,383
- that fits your level. - That's good.

2429
01:17:50,384 --> 01:17:55,044
Those wearing white t-shirts in the video will be you guys.

2430
01:17:55,453 --> 01:17:56,709
What kind of dance is it?

2431
01:17:57,184 --> 01:17:59,053
- Let's see. - It looks amazing.

2432
01:17:59,054 --> 01:18:00,652
- White t-shirts. - The white t-shirts will be us.

2433
01:18:00,653 --> 01:18:01,822
It looks amazing.

2434
01:18:01,823 --> 01:18:04,523
(The formation looks cool from the beginning.)

2435
01:18:04,524 --> 01:18:05,962
The start isn't bad.

2436
01:18:06,863 --> 01:18:08,056
- What? - What is that?

2437
01:18:08,333 --> 01:18:09,603
Will we do that?

2438
01:18:09,604 --> 01:18:11,032
(They starts to feel...)

2439
01:18:11,033 --> 01:18:12,462
It's too difficult.

2440
01:18:12,533 --> 01:18:13,973
I don't think we can pull that off.

2441
01:18:13,974 --> 01:18:15,095
What should we do?

2442
01:18:15,243 --> 01:18:16,242
- This is... - No.

2443
01:18:16,243 --> 01:18:17,631
We can't do this.

2444
01:18:18,144 --> 01:18:19,273
I like the beat.

2445
01:18:19,274 --> 01:18:20,673
(The beat gets faster, and they start to dance in perfect sync.)

2446
01:18:20,674 --> 01:18:21,734
We can't do it.

2447
01:18:22,644 --> 01:18:24,313
(How can we do this?)

2448
01:18:24,314 --> 01:18:26,152
- How can we do it? - How?

2449
01:18:26,153 --> 01:18:28,398
- How can we do it? - We can't.

2450
01:18:29,953 --> 01:18:31,893
(They follow the faster beats.)

2451
01:18:31,894 --> 01:18:33,790
(Movements become powerful as the beat gets faster.)

2452
01:18:34,394 --> 01:18:36,162
Isn't this a choreography for a competition?

2453
01:18:36,163 --> 01:18:37,792
Is it for an international competition?

2454
01:18:37,793 --> 01:18:38,962
It's appropriate for competitions.

2455
01:18:38,963 --> 01:18:40,162
Those in white are us.

2456
01:18:40,163 --> 01:18:41,969
I know. That's us.

2457
01:18:42,033 --> 01:18:43,869
- What's that? - What's that?

2458
01:18:44,863 --> 01:18:46,072
(The rhythm changes.)

2459
01:18:46,073 --> 01:18:47,173
That was instant.

2460
01:18:47,174 --> 01:18:48,473
(Movements keep changing.)

2461
01:18:48,474 --> 01:18:50,072
- It's interesting. Goodness. - No way.

2462
01:18:50,073 --> 01:18:51,909
- I can't get up like that. - How?

2463
01:18:52,073 --> 01:18:53,612
- It looks amazing though. - We can't do it.

2464
01:18:53,613 --> 01:18:54,869
It does look amazing.

2465
01:18:55,083 --> 01:18:56,412
I want to do like Celeb Five.

2466
01:18:56,413 --> 01:18:58,219
This is not Celeb Five's dances.

2467
01:19:01,083 --> 01:19:02,523
My joints already hurt.

2468
01:19:02,524 --> 01:19:04,085
(Their joints hurt already.)

2469
01:19:05,453 --> 01:19:07,652
(Is it over?)

2470
01:19:07,653 --> 01:19:08,662
It's not over.

2471
01:19:08,663 --> 01:19:09,723
- Is there more? - There's more.

2472
01:19:09,724 --> 01:19:10,893
There is.

2473
01:19:10,894 --> 01:19:12,992
- No way. - It should be over.

2474
01:19:12,993 --> 01:19:14,116
- Is there more? - This is Ji Hyo's part.

2475
01:19:15,033 --> 01:19:16,940
(The beat becomes lighter.)

2476
01:19:17,264 --> 01:19:18,433
There are two. What?

2477
01:19:18,434 --> 01:19:19,502
(They work together.)

2478
01:19:19,503 --> 01:19:20,931
Do we have to do that?

2479
01:19:22,104 --> 01:19:23,572
So Min and Kwang Soo can do it.

2480
01:19:27,913 --> 01:19:29,985
Did you see them getting in formation without looking?

2481
01:19:32,814 --> 01:19:34,108
This is exciting.

2482
01:19:34,783 --> 01:19:36,150
It looks cool though.

2483
01:19:36,384 --> 01:19:38,152
- It looks amazing. - It's awesome.

2484
01:19:38,153 --> 01:19:39,523
Add some of these.

2485
01:19:39,524 --> 01:19:41,423
Let's keep that one.

2486
01:19:41,424 --> 01:19:43,607
- Kwang Soo can do it. - We can add this.

2487
01:19:43,924 --> 01:19:45,263
We can add this one.

2488
01:19:45,264 --> 01:19:47,884
- This is like a circus. - It is indeed.

2489
01:19:49,234 --> 01:19:51,872
The dance is well choreographed.

2490
01:19:51,873 --> 01:19:53,129
Seriously.

2491
01:19:53,434 --> 01:19:55,443
(Isn't this fun?)

2492
01:19:55,444 --> 01:19:56,742
Lia, this is...

2493
01:19:56,743 --> 01:19:59,912
(Speechless)

2494
01:19:59,913 --> 01:20:01,096
How can do we that?

2495
01:20:01,213 --> 01:20:02,643
- How can we pull that off? - They're just...

2496
01:20:02,644 --> 01:20:04,742
- They're just showing it to us. - Do you think so?

2497
01:20:04,743 --> 01:20:07,100
- There's no way. - They're just showing it to us.

2498
01:20:07,913 --> 01:20:09,077
They're just showing it to us.

2499
01:20:09,224 --> 01:20:10,383
(Group dance for the fan-meet)

2500
01:20:10,384 --> 01:20:12,452
- By the way... - It looks amazing though.

2501
01:20:12,453 --> 01:20:13,853
- Seriously, - There's no way.

2502
01:20:13,854 --> 01:20:15,423
- it does look cool. - It does.

2503
01:20:15,424 --> 01:20:16,763
It is an art.

2504
01:20:16,764 --> 01:20:17,992
Yes, indeed.

2505
01:20:17,993 --> 01:20:20,162
- If we could dance well, - It looks amazing.

2506
01:20:20,163 --> 01:20:21,433
- we'd love to do it. - That'd be good.

2507
01:20:21,434 --> 01:20:22,733
- That'd be very good. - But...

2508
01:20:22,734 --> 01:20:23,902
- we can't. - We can't do it.

2509
01:20:23,903 --> 01:20:27,811
I adjusted the level to Celeb Five's dances.

2510
01:20:29,873 --> 01:20:32,742
- I made it look like their style. - They're good dancers.

2511
01:20:32,743 --> 01:20:35,743
(Is it that level?)

2512
01:20:36,514 --> 01:20:38,313
(Isn't it more difficult?)

2513
01:20:38,314 --> 01:20:40,082
Celeb Five members dance well.

2514
01:20:40,083 --> 01:20:41,112
That's right.

2515
01:20:41,113 --> 01:20:42,923
Celeb Five's dances are very difficult.

2516
01:20:42,924 --> 01:20:44,252
- Right. - Even to me,

2517
01:20:44,253 --> 01:20:45,492
- They dance so well. - it's very fast.

2518
01:20:45,493 --> 01:20:47,553
- There are many movements. - They're good dancers.

2519
01:20:47,554 --> 01:20:48,992
Aren't you asking too much from us?

2520
01:20:48,993 --> 01:20:50,963
We have two months left.

2521
01:20:50,963 --> 01:20:52,733
We have two months.

2522
01:20:52,734 --> 01:20:55,933
I didn't add any movements that require technique.

2523
01:20:55,934 --> 01:20:58,902
You can do it by memorizing, but the movements are quick.

2524
01:20:58,903 --> 01:21:01,633
They're quick, but you can do the movements by memorizing them.

2525
01:21:01,634 --> 01:21:04,663
- Those came later seemed difficult. - I know.

2526
01:21:04,873 --> 01:21:07,143
If we can do it, it'll be a miracle.

2527
01:21:07,144 --> 01:21:10,887
(Will the members be able to pull off the group dance?)

2528
01:21:11,283 --> 01:21:12,680
(Next week)

2529
01:21:13,653 --> 01:21:15,592
(Eight members challenge themselves to create a miracle.)

2530
01:21:15,783 --> 01:21:18,884
(However, they keep making errors.)

2531
01:21:19,094 --> 01:21:22,093
(Repeated practice awaits them.)

2532
01:21:22,094 --> 01:21:23,693
(What? Look at that! They're starting to dance in sync.)

2533
01:21:23,694 --> 01:21:24,918
(Everyone can do it. My gosh!)

2534
01:21:25,663 --> 01:21:27,602
(Will the members have a miracle?)

2535
01:21:28,264 --> 01:21:29,457
(And...)

2536
01:21:29,604 --> 01:21:31,702
(the filming for the Running Shirts starts at last.)

2537
01:21:31,703 --> 01:21:33,979
(The makeup that shocks everyone will be revealed.)

2538
01:21:34,174 --> 01:21:36,826
(4th Episode for 9 Years of Running Man: There Was a Miracle)
