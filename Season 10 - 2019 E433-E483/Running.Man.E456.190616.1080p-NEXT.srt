1
00:00:05,809 --> 00:00:07,279
(Geumsan-gun, South Chungcheong Province)

2
00:00:07,280 --> 00:00:08,578
Hello.

3
00:00:08,579 --> 00:00:10,109
- Hello. - Hi.

4
00:00:10,110 --> 00:00:12,089
- Hi. - Hello, everyone.

5
00:00:12,149 --> 00:00:13,988
My gosh, that tree looks like ginseng.

6
00:00:13,989 --> 00:00:15,274
It's ginseng.

7
00:00:15,319 --> 00:00:16,448
That's homemade ginseng wine.

8
00:00:16,449 --> 00:00:19,119
- My gosh, that's so healthy. - We're at a ginseng museum.

9
00:00:19,120 --> 00:00:20,211
- This feels healthy. - Hello.

10
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:23,891
I have good news. It's about So Min.

11
00:00:23,929 --> 00:00:25,459
She moved again.

12
00:00:25,460 --> 00:00:26,480
(Too much information during the opening segment)

13
00:00:26,929 --> 00:00:28,068
- She moved to a bigger house. - Thank you.

14
00:00:28,069 --> 00:00:29,228
- It's a bigger house. - Where did you move to?

15
00:00:29,229 --> 00:00:31,568
- It's apartment next to old one. - It's apartment next to old one.

16
00:00:31,569 --> 00:00:34,208
It's five steps from my old place. It's right next to my old place.

17
00:00:34,209 --> 00:00:36,369
- Didn't you get one more room? - Yes.

18
00:00:36,370 --> 00:00:37,408
- How many rooms do you have? - Right.

19
00:00:37,409 --> 00:00:38,679
I have three rooms now.

20
00:00:38,680 --> 00:00:39,679
(Feeling proud)

21
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:42,378
So Min told me how big her place has gotten.

22
00:00:42,379 --> 00:00:43,778
The way she explained it to me...

23
00:00:43,779 --> 00:00:45,249
- was quite shocking. - How?

24
00:00:45,250 --> 00:00:47,901
She said she almost peed her pants on her way to the bathroom.

25
00:00:48,489 --> 00:00:50,289
- Your house is that big? - That's what she said.

26
00:00:50,290 --> 00:00:51,719
- Hey, So Min. - That's true.

27
00:00:51,720 --> 00:00:54,289
Her expression was too shocking.

28
00:00:54,290 --> 00:00:57,359
Actually, if it were Seok Jin, he probably did pee his pants.

29
00:00:57,360 --> 00:01:00,184
(Is this possible for Seok Jin?)

30
00:01:00,360 --> 00:01:02,879
- He would've peed on his way. - That's terrible.

31
00:01:03,169 --> 00:01:05,923
Hey, I'm still going strong. I'm still going strong.

32
00:01:06,440 --> 00:01:07,469
(Given the circumstance, he's almost Seok Jin's doctor.)

33
00:01:07,470 --> 00:01:08,839
Seok Jin has...

34
00:01:08,840 --> 00:01:10,268
- a new nickname. - What is it?

35
00:01:10,269 --> 00:01:11,878
Mr. Residual Urine.

36
00:01:11,879 --> 00:01:13,779
(Before the shoot, he got a new nickname, Mr. Residual Urine.)

37
00:01:13,780 --> 00:01:15,148
- Residual Urine. - Residual Urine.

38
00:01:15,149 --> 00:01:16,479
That's not true.

39
00:01:16,480 --> 00:01:18,378
- That's cute. - My gosh, I'm really upset.

40
00:01:18,379 --> 00:01:19,618
It sounds like he's a fairy.

41
00:01:19,619 --> 00:01:22,788
What he said infuriated me the most.

42
00:01:22,789 --> 00:01:25,359
Before the shoot, even if you don't need to go,

43
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:27,859
- you'd go to the restroom anyway. - That's understandable.

44
00:01:27,860 --> 00:01:30,458
After hearing it next to me, he told me I was...

45
00:01:30,459 --> 00:01:31,958
Jee Stream.

46
00:01:32,300 --> 00:01:34,881
- Right, right. - Did it just trickle down?

47
00:01:35,629 --> 00:01:38,628
- Seriously. He was quiet at first. - Jee Stream.

48
00:01:38,769 --> 00:01:39,839
Trickling.

49
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:41,109
(I was there too.)

50
00:01:41,110 --> 00:01:42,568
- I was standing there too. - That breaks my heart.

51
00:01:42,569 --> 00:01:45,178
- At one point... - Hey, hey.

52
00:01:45,179 --> 00:01:47,949
After talking about prostate,

53
00:01:47,950 --> 00:01:49,749
- our conversation has gotten weird. - Right.

54
00:01:49,750 --> 00:01:50,878
- It's unnecessary. - Right.

55
00:01:50,879 --> 00:01:52,148
- I'm sorry. - I'm sorry.

56
00:01:52,149 --> 00:01:53,889
- Jee Stream is funny. - That's right.

57
00:01:53,890 --> 00:01:55,749
- That was funny. - By the way, Jae Seok used...

58
00:01:55,750 --> 00:01:57,288
- the app for baby faces. - Oh, that.

59
00:01:57,289 --> 00:01:58,749
I did this with Sae Ho.

60
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:00,859
- I took one with Sae Ho. - I saw that photo.

61
00:02:00,860 --> 00:02:02,389
That's your mother.

62
00:02:02,390 --> 00:02:03,729
His mother looks just like that.

63
00:02:03,730 --> 00:02:06,029
He looks just like her mother. That's his mother.

64
00:02:06,030 --> 00:02:07,368
His mouth is the same.

65
00:02:07,369 --> 00:02:08,968
- Yes. - You have the same mouth.

66
00:02:08,969 --> 00:02:11,099
- It's the same with you too. - My mouth doesn't change with CG.

67
00:02:11,100 --> 00:02:12,569
Nothing can fix your mouth.

68
00:02:12,570 --> 00:02:14,238
- That's true. - My gosh.

69
00:02:14,239 --> 00:02:15,838
- Haha took one too. - Haha took one too.

70
00:02:15,839 --> 00:02:17,738
My wife uploaded that photo.

71
00:02:17,739 --> 00:02:18,879
- You look adorable. - Your wife did?

72
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:20,778
Seok Jin should take one too.

73
00:02:20,779 --> 00:02:23,196
(The members start looking for their baby photos.)

74
00:02:24,380 --> 00:02:25,879
I'm really surprised by Seok Jin's photo.

75
00:02:25,880 --> 00:02:27,684
- Why? - This app gives you the baby photo.

76
00:02:28,189 --> 00:02:30,188
- That's just Seok Jin. - It's just him.

77
00:02:31,260 --> 00:02:33,289
- It looks just like Seok Jin. - How can a baby look that old?

78
00:02:33,290 --> 00:02:34,329
- Let me see. - I can see his wrinkles.

79
00:02:34,330 --> 00:02:36,659
It just looks like you put on heavy makeup.

80
00:02:36,660 --> 00:02:39,659
- Ji Hyo, why don't you try it too? - Why are we using this app now?

81
00:02:39,860 --> 00:02:40,950
Ji Hyo will look pretty.

82
00:02:41,830 --> 00:02:43,129
(She smiles to look younger.)

83
00:02:43,130 --> 00:02:45,238
- Let me see. - Wait, hold on.

84
00:02:45,239 --> 00:02:47,639
- Ji Hyo... What is this? - Isn't that Wong Fei Hung?

85
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:49,445
Half of her face is her forehead.

86
00:02:50,010 --> 00:02:52,238
- Right. You really look like him. - Seriously.

87
00:02:52,239 --> 00:02:53,479
Her forehead takes up half of her face.

88
00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:55,009
She's definitely not from Korea.

89
00:02:55,010 --> 00:02:57,278
- She looks exotic. - She looks like a Chinese girl.

90
00:02:57,279 --> 00:02:58,979
- Hey. - She looks like a Chinese girl.

91
00:02:58,980 --> 00:03:00,018
Let's try one with Jong Kook.

92
00:03:00,019 --> 00:03:01,688
- Jong Kook. - No, no.

93
00:03:01,689 --> 00:03:03,688
- Jong Kook. - Jong Kook, look over here.

94
00:03:03,689 --> 00:03:05,558
- I won't do it. - Come on, try it.

95
00:03:05,559 --> 00:03:06,988
- Just try it once. - Come over here.

96
00:03:06,989 --> 00:03:08,458
- I bet his photo will look great. - His arm...

97
00:03:08,459 --> 00:03:09,659
(He smiles to look young after refusing to take one.)

98
00:03:09,660 --> 00:03:11,629
- You haven't changed at all. - My gosh.

99
00:03:11,630 --> 00:03:13,129
- Hey, he just looks like himself. - My gosh.

100
00:03:13,130 --> 00:03:14,829
This boy looks like a great fighter.

101
00:03:14,830 --> 00:03:17,998
He's only a boy, but he looks so mean.

102
00:03:17,999 --> 00:03:19,498
- This boy looks scary. - He's only a boy.

103
00:03:19,499 --> 00:03:21,139
- He's scary. - He looks scary.

104
00:03:21,140 --> 00:03:22,238
- That was fun. - This is so much fun.

105
00:03:22,239 --> 00:03:24,076
Do we have more news to share? There's none, right?

106
00:03:24,510 --> 00:03:26,212
- We'll just start. - Okay.

107
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:27,748
- "We'll just start." - The next one was yours,

108
00:03:27,749 --> 00:03:28,800
but we'll just start.

109
00:03:29,510 --> 00:03:30,778
Please talk about me once.

110
00:03:30,779 --> 00:03:32,049
Just one more news. Please.

111
00:03:32,050 --> 00:03:33,889
- People might be curious about me. - Just one more news.

112
00:03:33,890 --> 00:03:34,949
Do we have news about Kwang Soo?

113
00:03:34,950 --> 00:03:36,959
- We do have news about him. - You ripped it off.

114
00:03:37,189 --> 00:03:39,018
(This is the news.)

115
00:03:39,019 --> 00:03:40,458
- Okay, okay. - Kwang Soo didn't...

116
00:03:40,459 --> 00:03:42,259
- send a coffee truck from Ji Hyo. - Did you send one?

117
00:03:42,260 --> 00:03:44,659
Did you send one to Bo Young and Lee Si Eon?

118
00:03:44,660 --> 00:03:46,231
("Kwang Soo Sends a Coffee Truck for Si Eon and Bo Young")

119
00:03:46,499 --> 00:03:48,368
(I see. This was the news.)

120
00:03:48,369 --> 00:03:49,928
I didn't know that was the news. Okay, okay.

121
00:03:49,929 --> 00:03:51,468
- What was that? Why? - I'm sorry.

122
00:03:51,469 --> 00:03:54,768
I'm sorry, Ji Hyo. I'm sorry.

123
00:03:54,769 --> 00:03:56,268
- I'm sorry. Sorry. - That was so mean.

124
00:03:56,269 --> 00:03:57,509
You sent one to Bo Young.

125
00:03:57,510 --> 00:04:00,579
- But you do spend some money. - You know...

126
00:04:00,580 --> 00:04:03,109
(Haha summons his new character of Greedy Millipede again.)

127
00:04:03,110 --> 00:04:04,148
There he goes again.

128
00:04:04,149 --> 00:04:06,248
- He doesn't spend money on us. - Right, right. Okay.

129
00:04:06,249 --> 00:04:08,463
- That's nice to see. - He spends money for others.

130
00:04:08,589 --> 00:04:09,977
- There they go again. - You know what?

131
00:04:10,350 --> 00:04:12,659
You know what? I can understand that he'd send one to Bo Young.

132
00:04:12,660 --> 00:04:14,028
- We can understand that. - Say Ji Hyo can understand that.

133
00:04:14,029 --> 00:04:15,058
But Si Eon...

134
00:04:15,059 --> 00:04:16,388
They were filming the drama together.

135
00:04:16,389 --> 00:04:19,029
You sent one for Si Eon, but how could you not send one for Ji Hyo?

136
00:04:19,030 --> 00:04:21,828
Hold on. Didn't you send one to Min Young the other day?

137
00:04:21,829 --> 00:04:23,498
- Yes, I sent one to Min Young. - I did see that too.

138
00:04:23,499 --> 00:04:26,238
(Jae Seok sent a dessert truck to Min Young.)

139
00:04:26,239 --> 00:04:28,238
- Min Young... - Did you send one to Ji Hyo?

140
00:04:28,239 --> 00:04:30,238
("Jae Seok did that?" Her eyes shake.)

141
00:04:30,239 --> 00:04:33,238
Min Young sent me ginger tea, jujube tea, and kimchi.

142
00:04:33,239 --> 00:04:35,308
- She sent you half-dried herring. - Right.

143
00:04:35,309 --> 00:04:36,378
(She sent you half-dried herring every year.)

144
00:04:36,379 --> 00:04:38,113
- Right. - She sent you half-dried herring.

145
00:04:38,119 --> 00:04:39,878
- We got him. - She sent you that.

146
00:04:39,879 --> 00:04:41,318
- Jae Seok. - But you didn't send her a truck?

147
00:04:41,389 --> 00:04:43,519
Why didn't you send her one?

148
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:45,222
(When things aren't working out for him...)

149
00:04:45,819 --> 00:04:47,869
We have to discuss this.

150
00:04:47,989 --> 00:04:49,928
Ji Hyo sent him so much half-dried herring.

151
00:04:49,929 --> 00:04:51,558
She sent him so much half-dried herring.

152
00:04:51,559 --> 00:04:52,859
It's really upsetting me.

153
00:04:52,860 --> 00:04:54,128
Ji Hyo, I'm really sorry.

154
00:04:54,129 --> 00:04:57,638
Ji Hyo wasn't filming a drama when I thought about this.

155
00:04:57,770 --> 00:04:59,299
Why did you make this worse?

156
00:04:59,300 --> 00:05:01,717
His face is getting red. Now, I feel relieved.

157
00:05:01,939 --> 00:05:03,368
- Both of them are suffering. - Let's switch places.

158
00:05:03,369 --> 00:05:04,808
He wants to switch places.

159
00:05:05,579 --> 00:05:07,078
- Hey, move there. - Why?

160
00:05:07,079 --> 00:05:08,909
- Ji Hyo, just film a drama. - I mean it.

161
00:05:08,910 --> 00:05:10,748
(I can just easily go to you. Hello, Jae Seok.)

162
00:05:10,749 --> 00:05:11,748
(The ghost of coffee truck shows up.)

163
00:05:11,749 --> 00:05:13,878
- I should send one for her drama. - You should stand between them.

164
00:05:13,879 --> 00:05:16,019
- She's filming a movie nowadays. - Come here. It's uncomfortable.

165
00:05:16,020 --> 00:05:17,188
Why is she...

166
00:05:17,189 --> 00:05:18,258
Why aren't you filming a drama now?

167
00:05:18,259 --> 00:05:21,558
You don't send a coffee truck when you're really close.

168
00:05:21,559 --> 00:05:22,558
(Just like us)

169
00:05:22,559 --> 00:05:24,128
- You don't have to send a truck. - That's right.

170
00:05:24,129 --> 00:05:25,198
- I feel shy about that. - Right.

171
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:27,828
- All right. In that case... - Right. Don't do it.

172
00:05:27,829 --> 00:05:30,128
(The ghost of coffee truck is kicked out before she could speak.)

173
00:05:30,129 --> 00:05:31,998
Why would I send one to my family?

174
00:05:31,999 --> 00:05:34,568
- Right. Don't be so disappointed. - Yes, let's not do that.

175
00:05:34,569 --> 00:05:36,854
- I feel shy about that. - I see you every week.

176
00:05:36,970 --> 00:05:38,308
- It's telling Mom that I love her. - I see Min Young from time to time.

177
00:05:38,309 --> 00:05:40,109
- We see each other every week. - Right. We meet every week.

178
00:05:40,110 --> 00:05:41,109
- Right. - He doesn't see her often.

179
00:05:41,110 --> 00:05:43,049
- Forget about this whole thing. - We didn't do anything wrong.

180
00:05:43,050 --> 00:05:44,279
- I'm sorry. - Right.

181
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:45,748
- Pretend this never happened. - I'm sorry, Ji Hyo.

182
00:05:45,749 --> 00:05:47,178
I couldn't send one because I feel shy about it.

183
00:05:47,179 --> 00:05:50,488
I think you set the mood nicely before we start our race today.

184
00:05:50,489 --> 00:05:51,488
- Right. - Yes.

185
00:05:51,489 --> 00:05:54,029
Before we start the race, you will write down...

186
00:05:54,030 --> 00:05:57,459
more than one modifiers such as words or nicknames...

187
00:05:57,460 --> 00:06:00,459
that remind you of the members including yourself.

188
00:06:00,460 --> 00:06:01,628
- For all of us? - Everyone?

189
00:06:01,629 --> 00:06:02,669
- For everyone? - I see.

190
00:06:02,670 --> 00:06:04,299
Nickname? Like what they're known as?

191
00:06:04,300 --> 00:06:05,638
- Right. - All right.

192
00:06:05,639 --> 00:06:07,026
Okay, let's do this.

193
00:06:08,910 --> 00:06:11,531
"Write down words or phrases that remind you of each member."

194
00:06:12,079 --> 00:06:13,308
"Jee Seok Jin."

195
00:06:13,309 --> 00:06:14,649
(Everyone writes down nicknames for each member.)

196
00:06:14,650 --> 00:06:17,109
"Jee Seok Jin. He's very gentle."

197
00:06:17,110 --> 00:06:19,149
- Come on, are you serious? - "He's gentle."

198
00:06:19,150 --> 00:06:21,291
That's not even funny. Why would you write that?

199
00:06:21,949 --> 00:06:23,318
(Jong Kook is being brutally honest again.)

200
00:06:23,319 --> 00:06:24,615
He said that wasn't even funny.

201
00:06:24,619 --> 00:06:25,843
"English gentleman".

202
00:06:26,189 --> 00:06:28,258
- You're not an English gentleman. - "Gentleman".

203
00:06:28,259 --> 00:06:30,058
You're not like those English gentlemen at all.

204
00:06:30,059 --> 00:06:32,680
- Besides, that's an oldie's thing. - I'm...

205
00:06:32,900 --> 00:06:34,229
(An Outdated Thinking: Cool men are English gentlemen.)

206
00:06:34,230 --> 00:06:35,769
- Seriously. - James Bond.

207
00:06:35,770 --> 00:06:36,850
I'm serious.

208
00:06:36,970 --> 00:06:40,099
- "Lee Kwang Soo". - Kwang Soo? What should I write?

209
00:06:40,100 --> 00:06:41,308
"Ugly Long Legs".

210
00:06:41,309 --> 00:06:43,104
(Childish nickname)

211
00:06:45,579 --> 00:06:47,039
"Ugly Greedy Millipede".

212
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:48,248
(Or we can go with this.)

213
00:06:48,249 --> 00:06:49,678
Can you just choose one?

214
00:06:50,150 --> 00:06:51,884
Get rid of the millipede then.

215
00:06:52,780 --> 00:06:54,004
"Stage Four Actor Syndrome".

216
00:06:54,220 --> 00:06:55,270
What?

217
00:06:55,790 --> 00:06:57,089
What are you talking about?

218
00:06:57,090 --> 00:06:58,110
You don't have that?

219
00:07:00,119 --> 00:07:01,258
"Cherished Comedian".

220
00:07:01,259 --> 00:07:02,279
(This one will be nice.)

221
00:07:02,929 --> 00:07:04,128
Was Kwang Soo a comedian?

222
00:07:04,129 --> 00:07:05,159
Did you not know?

223
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:06,659
(He was my junior comedian.)

224
00:07:06,660 --> 00:07:08,229
- You were my junior comedian. - This feels weird.

225
00:07:08,230 --> 00:07:09,828
- You're getting special treatment. - This feels weird.

226
00:07:09,829 --> 00:07:11,068
- Cherished Comedian. - "Comedian".

227
00:07:11,069 --> 00:07:12,638
(Jae Seok's Cherished Comedian, Lee Kwang Soo)

228
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:15,469
- I'm happy about this. - That's hilarious.

229
00:07:15,470 --> 00:07:16,868
- This feels weird. - This is nice.

230
00:07:16,869 --> 00:07:18,279
Look at this. See how much I adore you.

231
00:07:18,280 --> 00:07:20,482
- That's not a bad one. - That's a nice one.

232
00:07:21,150 --> 00:07:22,842
"Jeon So Min, Crazy Poet".

233
00:07:23,509 --> 00:07:26,171
(Crazy Poet: She usually writes her poems late at night.)

234
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:27,589
- That's nice. - Yes.

235
00:07:27,590 --> 00:07:28,888
- That sounds charming. - Right. Crazy Poet.

236
00:07:28,889 --> 00:07:30,988
- I sound like a real artist. - Right.

237
00:07:30,989 --> 00:07:32,551
What should I go with Se Chan?

238
00:07:33,090 --> 00:07:36,058
"My Confidence Booster".

239
00:07:36,059 --> 00:07:37,258
(Se Chan is his Confidence Booster.)

240
00:07:37,259 --> 00:07:38,828
Okay.

241
00:07:38,829 --> 00:07:39,828
(He's the source of Jae Seok's confidence.)

242
00:07:39,829 --> 00:07:41,269
You'll get our looks involved?

243
00:07:41,270 --> 00:07:43,238
- You'll present after five minutes. - Okay.

244
00:07:43,869 --> 00:07:45,808
"Haha, The Last Con Artist".

245
00:07:46,270 --> 00:07:48,075
(Smiling)

246
00:07:48,470 --> 00:07:50,682
Great. I'll write down "Fool" under his name.

247
00:07:51,410 --> 00:07:52,638
(This fool who only cares about exercises...)

248
00:07:52,639 --> 00:07:53,839
(is his business partner.)

249
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:55,849
(All 8 of them finish writing down nicknames.)

250
00:07:55,850 --> 00:07:57,441
All right. Let's present now.

251
00:07:57,650 --> 00:07:59,313
- I'll start first. - Okay, Kwang Soo.

252
00:07:59,980 --> 00:08:03,349
I'll start with myself first. I call myself Abundance of Charms.

253
00:08:03,350 --> 00:08:04,359
- Kind of... - What?

254
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:06,219
(Kwang Soo wrote down Abundance of Charms for himself.)

255
00:08:06,220 --> 00:08:07,657
Isn't it more of Lack of Charms?

256
00:08:07,829 --> 00:08:09,988
No, Abundance of Charms. I'm Abundance of Charms.

257
00:08:09,989 --> 00:08:11,859
Kind and Comforting Face.

258
00:08:11,860 --> 00:08:13,900
Mine is pretty simple. This is for Seok Jin.

259
00:08:14,499 --> 00:08:15,568
Pees Like a Sparrow.

260
00:08:15,569 --> 00:08:17,969
(He wrote down Pees Like a Sparrow for Seok Jin.)

261
00:08:17,970 --> 00:08:21,336
That's cute. Sparrows are cute. Those birds are cute.

262
00:08:21,639 --> 00:08:24,779
Anyway, those birds pee too. So, he is Pees Like a Sparrow.

263
00:08:24,780 --> 00:08:26,508
- And the next one is Nolbu. - What?

264
00:08:26,509 --> 00:08:27,678
- Why? - Pardon?

265
00:08:27,679 --> 00:08:29,279
- Why? - Nolbu is famous for being greedy.

266
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:30,878
(He doesn't have a particular reason behind it.)

267
00:08:30,879 --> 00:08:32,749
You're basically criticizing him.

268
00:08:32,750 --> 00:08:34,078
- That's not a nickname. - No, that's not true.

269
00:08:34,079 --> 00:08:35,419
- This is Jae Seok's. - Okay.

270
00:08:35,420 --> 00:08:36,440
Ugly Guy.

271
00:08:36,689 --> 00:08:39,159
- My gosh, that's perfect for him. - Gosh, he's unbelievable.

272
00:08:39,160 --> 00:08:40,659
- He's gone mad. - Okay.

273
00:08:40,660 --> 00:08:42,858
And I wrote down Leggings Lover.

274
00:08:42,859 --> 00:08:44,358
- Leggings Lover. That makes sense. - Right?

275
00:08:44,359 --> 00:08:45,583
He's Yuggings.

276
00:08:45,660 --> 00:08:47,128
And for Jong Kook,

277
00:08:47,359 --> 00:08:48,369
I wrote Thug.

278
00:08:48,370 --> 00:08:49,900
(It's simple.)

279
00:08:50,270 --> 00:08:51,499
How could you call me that?

280
00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:53,407
It's just a nickname.

281
00:08:53,569 --> 00:08:54,869
- That just came to your mind. - Right.

282
00:08:54,870 --> 00:08:56,196
- This is Se Chan's. - Okay.

283
00:08:56,740 --> 00:09:01,249
Ugly Guy Number Two.

284
00:09:01,250 --> 00:09:02,504
- Hey. - Hey.

285
00:09:02,679 --> 00:09:03,848
- Don't clump me with him. - 1 and 2.

286
00:09:03,849 --> 00:09:05,578
- I can't believe his nerve. - Why am I number two though?

287
00:09:05,579 --> 00:09:07,416
(A unit of Ugly Guys is created.)

288
00:09:08,020 --> 00:09:09,149
I'll go.

289
00:09:09,150 --> 00:09:12,250
This is for Seok Jin. His nickname is Honey Punch.

290
00:09:12,459 --> 00:09:13,619
- Honey Punch. - That's right.

291
00:09:13,620 --> 00:09:14,629
- I haven't heard that for a while. - That's cute.

292
00:09:14,630 --> 00:09:16,828
- Honey Punch. - I really think it's really cute.

293
00:09:16,829 --> 00:09:17,849
Death Mole.

294
00:09:18,829 --> 00:09:20,129
- Death Mole. That's right. - I don't have that.

295
00:09:20,130 --> 00:09:22,029
I was just writing mine based on our discussion.

296
00:09:22,030 --> 00:09:24,968
Next up is Jong Kook. Kwang Soo's and mine overlapped.

297
00:09:24,969 --> 00:09:26,269
He wrote, "Thug".

298
00:09:26,270 --> 00:09:27,739
I wrote, "First Generation Thug".

299
00:09:27,740 --> 00:09:29,468
(He's not just ordinary thug. He's 1st Generation Thug.)

300
00:09:29,469 --> 00:09:30,663
(1st Generation Thug)

301
00:09:31,380 --> 00:09:32,478
Yes, he's the first generation.

302
00:09:32,479 --> 00:09:33,678
He's the original.

303
00:09:33,679 --> 00:09:35,689
That means that he's the original thug.

304
00:09:36,079 --> 00:09:37,779
- I wrote, "Romantic Punch". - "Romantic Punch".

305
00:09:37,780 --> 00:09:40,779
- Umigwan's Crew. - That one is nice.

306
00:09:40,780 --> 00:09:41,889
- Crew. - He's the Crew.

307
00:09:41,890 --> 00:09:43,919
- I see. - That's what I aimed for.

308
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:45,119
- It's Jae Seok's now. - Okay.

309
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:48,188
- Nutria. - That's perfect.

310
00:09:48,189 --> 00:09:50,029
(His nickname is totally based on facts.)

311
00:09:50,030 --> 00:09:51,629
- That little punk. - That's cute. It's cute.

312
00:09:51,630 --> 00:09:53,458
- I can't get rid of that one. - That's mean.

313
00:09:53,459 --> 00:09:55,061
- That's cute. - We have to include Nutria.

314
00:09:55,130 --> 00:09:56,293
My nickname is...

315
00:09:56,500 --> 00:09:58,305
Handsome Face without the Mouth.

316
00:09:58,339 --> 00:09:59,468
Hottie with Gums.

317
00:09:59,469 --> 00:10:00,591
- I'll approve. - My gosh.

318
00:10:00,670 --> 00:10:01,730
Right.

319
00:10:01,969 --> 00:10:03,949
- That's my list. - Great.

320
00:10:04,339 --> 00:10:06,678
First, I'll start with Jae Seok. It's Jae Seok's.

321
00:10:06,679 --> 00:10:07,904
Yu Brat.

322
00:10:07,979 --> 00:10:09,275
He's so bratty.

323
00:10:09,280 --> 00:10:11,919
He's bratty to the point where he gets annoying.

324
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:13,409
- This crossed my mind. - What is it?

325
00:10:13,650 --> 00:10:15,019
I thought that he could lend me 200,000 dollars...

326
00:10:15,020 --> 00:10:16,389
if I'm in a tight spot.

327
00:10:16,390 --> 00:10:18,735
(He's a colleague who can lend me up to 200,000 dollars.)

328
00:10:18,920 --> 00:10:20,317
- My gosh. Really? - Gosh.

329
00:10:20,420 --> 00:10:22,759
I think he'll wire me 200,000 to 300,000 dollars.

330
00:10:22,760 --> 00:10:24,188
- Right. - That crossed my mind.

331
00:10:24,189 --> 00:10:25,899
I would have to put your house up as collateral.

332
00:10:25,900 --> 00:10:28,583
(I would have to put your house up as collateral.)

333
00:10:29,130 --> 00:10:30,628
Right. That's the right way.

334
00:10:30,729 --> 00:10:32,468
Anyway, I'll lend him money.

335
00:10:32,469 --> 00:10:33,765
- I should do that. - Right.

336
00:10:33,900 --> 00:10:35,847
And this is Jong Kook's.

337
00:10:36,339 --> 00:10:40,052
I've been keeping this as a secret and haven't told anyone.

338
00:10:40,540 --> 00:10:42,178
Actually, I think I can get him with just one punch.

339
00:10:42,179 --> 00:10:44,379
(Actually, I think I can get him with just one punch.)

340
00:10:44,380 --> 00:10:45,879
(Responding to that is a hassle for him.)

341
00:10:45,880 --> 00:10:48,133
If I hit him at the vital point,

342
00:10:48,189 --> 00:10:50,188
- a punch will suffice. - Seok Jin.

343
00:10:50,189 --> 00:10:51,818
Think how many punches I can land on you when you punch me once.

344
00:10:51,819 --> 00:10:53,659
(Think how many punches I can land on you when you punch me once.)

345
00:10:53,660 --> 00:10:56,240
(A sharp comment from the 1st Generation Thug)

346
00:10:56,890 --> 00:10:57,928
- Hey. - Think about it.

347
00:10:57,929 --> 00:10:59,052
My left hand will be busy.

348
00:10:59,130 --> 00:11:00,899
When I punch you with my right hand, I'll stop your punches with my left.

349
00:11:00,900 --> 00:11:02,053
Like this.

350
00:11:02,270 --> 00:11:03,962
I had to think about this one. It's quite unexpected.

351
00:11:04,199 --> 00:11:06,338
- In my opinion, - Okay.

352
00:11:06,339 --> 00:11:08,411
Jong Kook will lend me up to 50,000 dollars.

353
00:11:08,870 --> 00:11:10,108
- Without any interests. - Me?

354
00:11:10,109 --> 00:11:11,773
- Why are you talking about this? - Why are we talking about money?

355
00:11:12,479 --> 00:11:14,348
- Why are you talking about this? - Why are we talking about money?

356
00:11:14,349 --> 00:11:16,043
- Why are we talking about money? - Did something happen to you?

357
00:11:16,050 --> 00:11:17,610
Seok Jin, do you need money?

358
00:11:17,750 --> 00:11:19,413
- Can't you lend me that much? - Of course.

359
00:11:19,550 --> 00:11:20,844
I lend money to a lot of people.

360
00:11:21,589 --> 00:11:23,762
But if you don't pay me back, you'll dearly pay for it.

361
00:11:24,459 --> 00:11:26,489
- Hey, I always pay it back. - Really?

362
00:11:26,490 --> 00:11:28,264
- He'll do everything to get it. - Really?

363
00:11:28,290 --> 00:11:29,584
He'll do everything to get it back.

364
00:11:29,660 --> 00:11:30,915
All right. This is Ji Hyo's.

365
00:11:31,130 --> 00:11:33,680
Whenever I look at her, she's always dozing off.

366
00:11:33,699 --> 00:11:35,269
Song Sleepy. Song Loner.

367
00:11:35,270 --> 00:11:36,928
- She likes to be alone. - Right.

368
00:11:36,929 --> 00:11:38,499
That's why her nickname is Song Van.

369
00:11:38,500 --> 00:11:41,239
(Her nickname is Song Van?)

370
00:11:41,240 --> 00:11:43,739
She's always resting in her van, so it's Song Van.

371
00:11:43,740 --> 00:11:45,678
(She's named Song Van because she's always resting in her van.)

372
00:11:45,679 --> 00:11:48,260
(Everyone agrees. It's the birth of a new nickname.)

373
00:11:48,449 --> 00:11:49,948
- That's funny. - Whenever she rests,

374
00:11:49,949 --> 00:11:51,448
- That's funny. - she's in the van.

375
00:11:51,449 --> 00:11:52,948
- That's a nice nickname. - I can understand why.

376
00:11:52,949 --> 00:11:54,718
- She's always resting in the van. - Song Van.

377
00:11:54,719 --> 00:11:56,188
- Song Van. - Song Van is funny.

378
00:11:56,189 --> 00:11:57,858
And I think Ji Hyo can...

379
00:11:57,859 --> 00:11:59,489
Since her parents take care of her finances,

380
00:11:59,490 --> 00:12:01,836
I think she can lend me about 20,000 dollars.

381
00:12:01,890 --> 00:12:03,489
Seok Jin, are you fleeing the country?

382
00:12:03,490 --> 00:12:05,259
(Seok Jin, are you fleeing the country?)

383
00:12:05,260 --> 00:12:06,698
(Comedian Jee is spotted from fleeing the country.)

384
00:12:06,699 --> 00:12:08,944
- Why are you talking about money? - Are you leaving with that money?

385
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,243
After talking about Jae Seok and how much he can lend me,

386
00:12:11,400 --> 00:12:13,838
I thought about how much each member could lend me.

387
00:12:13,839 --> 00:12:15,769
(Seok Jin finishes presenting the nicknames.)

388
00:12:15,770 --> 00:12:18,492
- I'll start from here. Me first. - Okay.

389
00:12:18,679 --> 00:12:19,832
"Haha".

390
00:12:19,910 --> 00:12:21,608
- "Stamina King". - What?

391
00:12:21,609 --> 00:12:23,478
(Haha nicknames himself as Stamina King.)

392
00:12:23,479 --> 00:12:24,478
(Haha, Stamina King)

393
00:12:24,479 --> 00:12:26,218
- What was that? - What do you mean?

394
00:12:26,219 --> 00:12:27,577
- Well, he has three children. - Why?

395
00:12:27,650 --> 00:12:28,649
It's Jae Seok's.

396
00:12:28,650 --> 00:12:29,818
AO.

397
00:12:29,819 --> 00:12:30,889
- What? - What's AO?

398
00:12:30,890 --> 00:12:32,159
(Jae Seok is AO.)

399
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:33,383
Apgujeong Oldie.

400
00:12:34,630 --> 00:12:36,529
- MF. - What's that?

401
00:12:36,530 --> 00:12:37,785
Messed-up Face.

402
00:12:38,459 --> 00:12:39,786
- I can't believe him. - My gosh.

403
00:12:40,429 --> 00:12:42,769
That's a nice word for his face.

404
00:12:42,770 --> 00:12:44,503
- JSG. - What's that?

405
00:12:44,699 --> 00:12:46,139
Jong Shin without Glasses.

406
00:12:46,140 --> 00:12:48,211
(Jong Shin without Glasses)

407
00:12:48,839 --> 00:12:51,009
- He's unbelievable. - Why did you shorten everything?

408
00:12:51,010 --> 00:12:52,673
He's definitely gone mad.

409
00:12:53,479 --> 00:12:55,009
- Jong Shin? - CB.

410
00:12:55,010 --> 00:12:56,049
What does that mean?

411
00:12:56,050 --> 00:12:57,279
Child's Body.

412
00:12:57,280 --> 00:12:59,055
(Child's Body)

413
00:12:59,520 --> 00:13:00,600
Right.

414
00:13:00,920 --> 00:13:03,019
All right. Mines are simple.

415
00:13:03,020 --> 00:13:05,232
Jae Seok is Goofball.

416
00:13:05,520 --> 00:13:07,458
Skeleton.

417
00:13:08,030 --> 00:13:09,759
(Skeleton)

418
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:11,258
- What? Skeleton? - Skeleton.

419
00:13:11,300 --> 00:13:12,728
- How could you say that? - To Jong Kook, he's a skeleton.

420
00:13:12,729 --> 00:13:13,799
- He's Skeleton. - Hey.

421
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:15,737
- Are we in elementary school now? - Skeleton.

422
00:13:15,829 --> 00:13:18,039
- Seriously? Skeleton? - I haven't heard that for a while.

423
00:13:18,040 --> 00:13:19,769
- That's original. - We used that a lot back then.

424
00:13:19,770 --> 00:13:21,608
And my nickname is One Man.

425
00:13:21,609 --> 00:13:24,638
(He calls Jae Seok Skeleton. And he calls himself One Man.)

426
00:13:25,010 --> 00:13:26,279
(He thinks he's so cool.)

427
00:13:26,280 --> 00:13:27,608
- That explains everything. - One Man.

428
00:13:27,609 --> 00:13:29,108
Ji Hyo's nickname is Ms. 40.

429
00:13:29,109 --> 00:13:31,619
(Welcome to your 40s. Her nickname is Ms. 40.)

430
00:13:31,620 --> 00:13:32,649
(She's 39 years old.)

431
00:13:32,650 --> 00:13:33,678
Ms. 40?

432
00:13:33,679 --> 00:13:35,688
- Is that Ms. Heart or Ms. 40? - Ms. 40.

433
00:13:35,689 --> 00:13:37,019
- I can't tease her with that. - Ms. 40.

434
00:13:37,020 --> 00:13:39,060
Coffee Truck Lover.

435
00:13:39,819 --> 00:13:41,900
I'll start with Kwang Soo's.

436
00:13:42,329 --> 00:13:43,989
- Loser. - Loser?

437
00:13:43,990 --> 00:13:46,243
(It's simple.)

438
00:13:46,329 --> 00:13:47,358
(Did I hear it wrong?)

439
00:13:47,359 --> 00:13:49,129
- That's so insulting. - Hey, Loser is here!

440
00:13:49,130 --> 00:13:50,628
(Picking on Kwang Soo)

441
00:13:50,770 --> 00:13:52,698
- It's short and insulting. - My gosh, Loser.

442
00:13:52,699 --> 00:13:54,269
It's like "Former Best Friend".

443
00:13:54,270 --> 00:13:55,509
Loser.

444
00:13:55,510 --> 00:13:56,608
And Super Loser.

445
00:13:56,609 --> 00:13:58,239
(He gets Super Loser after Loser.)

446
00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:00,608
(It's a somewhat of an upgrade from Loser.)

447
00:14:00,609 --> 00:14:02,049
She just wrote down curse words.

448
00:14:02,050 --> 00:14:03,049
(Can she do that?)

449
00:14:03,050 --> 00:14:04,049
My gosh, that was strong.

450
00:14:04,050 --> 00:14:05,610
And this is So Min's.

451
00:14:05,780 --> 00:14:07,105
Love Opportunist.

452
00:14:07,349 --> 00:14:09,249
- Love Opportunist. - Love Opportunist is nice.

453
00:14:09,250 --> 00:14:10,389
Love Opportunist.

454
00:14:10,390 --> 00:14:11,920
- He's an LO. - Come on.

455
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:13,188
Come to me, love.

456
00:14:13,189 --> 00:14:14,209
(Sounding depressed)

457
00:14:14,260 --> 00:14:16,778
- She's a local poet in Yongsan-gu. - Right.

458
00:14:17,689 --> 00:14:19,159
Cool Lady. That's for me.

459
00:14:19,160 --> 00:14:20,893
(She suddenly blurts it out.)

460
00:14:21,329 --> 00:14:23,369
Goosebumps. I got goosebumps.

461
00:14:23,370 --> 00:14:25,568
Seok Jin. Seok Jin's nickname is...

462
00:14:25,569 --> 00:14:28,068
- Don't Cross That River. - What?

463
00:14:28,069 --> 00:14:29,409
Don't Cross That River.

464
00:14:29,410 --> 00:14:30,568
That's a movie title.

465
00:14:30,569 --> 00:14:31,578
(A documentary that depicted last moments of an old couple)

466
00:14:31,579 --> 00:14:32,639
That's a movie title.

467
00:14:32,640 --> 00:14:33,779
(A documentary that depicted last moments of an old couple)

468
00:14:33,780 --> 00:14:35,238
- That's nice. - Add "Jin" in the front.

469
00:14:35,349 --> 00:14:37,678
Add "Jin". Jin...

470
00:14:37,679 --> 00:14:39,218
(Jin, don't cross that river.)

471
00:14:39,219 --> 00:14:42,209
Hey, if someone beckons to you, you can't go there, okay?

472
00:14:42,819 --> 00:14:44,149
- You'll be in big trouble. - Don't say that.

473
00:14:44,150 --> 00:14:46,200
- You can't cross that bridge. - Stop that.

474
00:14:46,660 --> 00:14:47,954
- Jin. - Jin.

475
00:14:48,030 --> 00:14:49,428
- This is Jae Seok's. - Okay.

476
00:14:49,429 --> 00:14:50,688
Yu Kid.

477
00:14:50,689 --> 00:14:51,781
Mouth Like Mount Baekdu.

478
00:14:52,130 --> 00:14:53,558
- "Mouth Like Mount Baekdu"? - "Mouth Like Mount Baekdu"?

479
00:14:54,099 --> 00:14:56,374
(Mouth Like Mount Baekdu)

480
00:14:57,099 --> 00:14:58,874

00:14:59,569 --> 00:15:00,739
- I like it. - That's really nice.

00:15:00,740 --> 00:15:01,830
(Outstanding poetic line)

483
00:15:01,910 --> 00:15:03,269
- Jae Seok. - She's unbelievable.

484
00:15:03,270 --> 00:15:05,217
Climber Um Hong Gil will contact you.

485
00:15:05,479 --> 00:15:07,071
He will want to climb your mouth.

486
00:15:07,679 --> 00:15:09,009
- Stop that. - What do you mean?

487
00:15:09,010 --> 00:15:10,540
- Stop teasing me. - What do you mean?

488
00:15:10,609 --> 00:15:12,119
How can she call me Mouth Like Mount Baekdu?

489
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:13,978
- I've never heard of this before. - She's too mean.

490
00:15:13,979 --> 00:15:15,649
- She's indeed a poet. - Mouth Like Mount Baekdu.

491
00:15:15,650 --> 00:15:16,749
- That's nice. - Mouth Like Mount Baekdu.

492
00:15:16,750 --> 00:15:18,493

I Don't Like You.

494
00:15:19,990 --> 00:15:21,244
Don't Pretend You Didn't Hear It.

495
00:15:22,390 --> 00:15:23,759
(His nicknames are...)

496
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:25,999
(I Don't Like You and Don't Pretend You Didn't Hear It.)

497
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,499
(So Min, Love Opportunist, gives soap-opera worthy nicknames.)

498
00:15:27,500 --> 00:15:28,499
Come on.

499
00:15:28,500 --> 00:15:31,029
- Are these really nicknames? - She just said whatever she wanted.

500
00:15:31,030 --> 00:15:33,345
She wrote these down to get them off her chest.

501
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:34,938
And Mouth Like Mount Halla.

502
00:15:34,939 --> 00:15:36,338
- Mouth Like Mount Halla. - Mouth Like Mount Halla?

503
00:15:36,339 --> 00:15:38,379
- I'm Mount Baekdu. - I'm Mount Halla. Mine is better.

504
00:15:38,380 --> 00:15:39,509
This is all.

505
00:15:39,510 --> 00:15:40,600
Mine is slightly better.

506
00:15:41,209 --> 00:15:44,578
I gave this a lot of thought. I thought about you a lot.

507
00:15:44,579 --> 00:15:45,742
That's why mine is packed.

508
00:15:45,880 --> 00:15:46,978
I'll start with Se Chan.

509
00:15:46,979 --> 00:15:48,959
My Confidence Booster.

510
00:15:49,719 --> 00:15:51,933
Mr. Gums. Se Hyeong's Brother.

511
00:15:51,959 --> 00:15:53,041
Model's Ex-Boyfriend.

512
00:15:53,260 --> 00:15:54,389
What? Model's Ex-Boyfriend?

513
00:15:54,390 --> 00:15:55,629
Wasn't your ex a model?

514
00:15:55,630 --> 00:15:57,029
- Was she a flight attendant? - No.

515
00:15:57,030 --> 00:15:58,129
Let me revise it.

516
00:15:58,130 --> 00:15:59,529
Flight Attendant's Ex.

517
00:15:59,530 --> 00:16:02,598
(Se Chan's nickname is Flight Attendant's Ex.)

518
00:16:02,599 --> 00:16:03,629
- Jae Seok. - No.

519
00:16:03,630 --> 00:16:04,739
That's you.

520
00:16:04,740 --> 00:16:06,568
(Getting up)

521
00:16:06,569 --> 00:16:07,669
Have you gone mad?

522
00:16:07,670 --> 00:16:09,914
(Have you gone mad?)

523
00:16:10,040 --> 00:16:12,864
(Will they start exposing each other's secrets?)

524
00:16:13,240 --> 00:16:14,708
- I'm going to write this down. - Stop it.

525
00:16:14,780 --> 00:16:16,208
- You know what? - Stop it. Stop it.

526
00:16:16,209 --> 00:16:17,678
- Stop it. - I'm going to write that down.

527
00:16:17,679 --> 00:16:18,872
- Stop it. - Don't do it.

528
00:16:18,979 --> 00:16:21,149
- Stop it. Don't dig your own grave. - You don't think I know?

529
00:16:21,150 --> 00:16:22,249
- Really? - This is interesting.

530
00:16:22,250 --> 00:16:23,519
- I'll write that down. - Easy, easy.

531
00:16:23,520 --> 00:16:25,662
(They barely manage to reconcile right before a big accident.)

532
00:16:26,719 --> 00:16:28,259
A lot of secrets will come out.

533
00:16:28,260 --> 00:16:30,025
- Should I write yours? - What? Stop it.

534
00:16:30,660 --> 00:16:32,537
- Should I write yours? - What? Stop it.

535
00:16:33,030 --> 00:16:34,386
Stop it. That's enough.

536
00:16:34,530 --> 00:16:37,049
- I know her name. I do. - My goodness.

537
00:16:37,599 --> 00:16:39,303
- Be quiet. - I know her name.

538
00:16:39,370 --> 00:16:40,739
(Before a bigger accident happens,)

539
00:16:40,740 --> 00:16:43,769
(8 of them finish presenting each other's nicknames.)

540
00:16:43,770 --> 00:16:46,900
All right. You wrote down nicknames for each other.

541
00:16:46,910 --> 00:16:48,279
Why did you make us write these?

542
00:16:48,280 --> 00:16:51,268
Today, you'll write down lyrics for the theme song.

543
00:16:51,309 --> 00:16:52,619
It's the 4th Episode of 9 Years of Running Man.

544
00:16:52,620 --> 00:16:53,879
It's the Knowing Your Place Race.

545
00:16:53,880 --> 00:16:55,655
(This will determine the lyrics for the theme song?)

546
00:16:55,750 --> 00:16:56,811
- Lyrics? - The theme song?

547
00:16:57,490 --> 00:16:58,558
Lyrics?

548
00:16:58,559 --> 00:17:00,019
(Is it possible that we might use the nicknames we just presented?)

549
00:17:00,020 --> 00:17:01,989
As for the theme song, professional songwriters...

550
00:17:01,990 --> 00:17:03,458
will be taking care of it.

551
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:06,343
But as for the nicknames for each member,

552
00:17:06,760 --> 00:17:09,890
we'll choose from the ones you just came up with.

553
00:17:10,700 --> 00:17:13,368
(They wrote down each other's weaknesses...)

554
00:17:13,369 --> 00:17:15,838
(without giving much thought.)

555
00:17:15,839 --> 00:17:19,539
(These nicknames may be used as lyrics for the theme song.)

556
00:17:19,540 --> 00:17:21,779
(The members were busy teasing each other.)

557
00:17:21,780 --> 00:17:22,779
- From these? - Messed-up Face.

558
00:17:22,780 --> 00:17:23,949
- Let's go with that. - We'll include these in the lyrics?

559
00:17:23,950 --> 00:17:25,041
That will be in our song?

560
00:17:25,550 --> 00:17:27,456
Mouth Like Mount Baekdu.

561
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:31,466
You're ginseng diggers who came to Geumsan, home for ginseng.

562
00:17:31,659 --> 00:17:33,519
You will start the race...

563
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:36,189
with 2 Ginseng Badges and 2 Venomous Snake Badges.

564
00:17:36,190 --> 00:17:37,689
- Ginseng and Venomous Snake? - Yes.

565
00:17:37,690 --> 00:17:40,178
Ginseng Badges mean good nicknames for you.

566
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:43,841
Venomous Snake Badges mean bad nicknames for you.

567
00:17:44,230 --> 00:17:46,398
At the end of the race, you'll remove Ginseng Badges...

568
00:17:46,399 --> 00:17:48,769
as many Venomous Snake Badges as you have.

569
00:17:48,770 --> 00:17:50,810
And that's how you'll end up with your nickname.

570
00:17:51,409 --> 00:17:52,539
Wait.

571
00:17:52,540 --> 00:17:54,580
What about Seok Jin's nickname, Jee Stream?

572
00:17:54,879 --> 00:17:55,878
Jee Stream.

573
00:17:55,879 --> 00:17:57,684
- This will go down in history. - That one is...

574
00:17:57,710 --> 00:17:58,719
This will be in the lyrics.

575
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:00,179
We have to get rid of that...

576
00:18:00,180 --> 00:18:02,291
because I didn't have to use the restroom then.

577
00:18:02,750 --> 00:18:05,065
I had a feeling that the shoot would last a long time.

578
00:18:05,419 --> 00:18:07,837
I didn't have to use the restroom back then!

579
00:18:07,960 --> 00:18:09,112
Jee Stream.

580
00:18:09,190 --> 00:18:10,459
At the end of the race,

581
00:18:10,460 --> 00:18:13,417
if you have the same number of both badges,

582
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:16,729
- we'll include your names. - Okay.

583
00:18:16,730 --> 00:18:19,168
For example, we'll just say so and so and Haha.

584
00:18:19,169 --> 00:18:20,838
- Jae Seok, so and so and Seok Jin. - Like this.

585
00:18:20,839 --> 00:18:23,168
- That's disappointing. - I'd rather have a nickname.

586
00:18:23,169 --> 00:18:25,016
After you change into the uniforms,

587
00:18:25,210 --> 00:18:26,606
we'll start the race.

588
00:18:26,639 --> 00:18:28,751
- Okay. - Let's go, everybody.

589
00:18:31,180 --> 00:18:32,241
Hurry.

590
00:18:32,750 --> 00:18:35,118
1, 2. 1, 2. 1, 2.

591
00:18:35,119 --> 00:18:37,058
- 1, 2. - It's the ginseng digger's outfit.

592
00:18:37,950 --> 00:18:41,458
(There are 8 mysterious bags on top of the table.)

593
00:18:41,859 --> 00:18:46,623
(Forget about the outfits. What are these bags?)

594
00:18:46,730 --> 00:18:49,269
I don't look good in this outfit no matter how much I try.

595
00:18:49,270 --> 00:18:50,368
It looks great on you.

596
00:18:50,369 --> 00:18:52,134
- Aren't you bedridden or something? - Right.

597
00:18:52,770 --> 00:18:54,299
(Does she look more like a patient than a ginseng digger?)

598
00:18:54,300 --> 00:18:55,338
- She's bedridden? - My gosh.

599
00:18:55,339 --> 00:18:57,788
- My gosh, woe is me. - It looks great on her.

600
00:18:57,809 --> 00:18:59,279
- People like her are sick in bed. - My gosh.

601
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:00,679
You'd be great in historical dramas.

602
00:19:00,680 --> 00:19:02,751
What an awful son I have. I told you not to get married.

603
00:19:03,079 --> 00:19:05,219
(Is she doing a skit out of nowhere?)

604
00:19:05,220 --> 00:19:06,449
- Go away. - But...

605
00:19:06,450 --> 00:19:08,019
why do you always start your skit with a curse word?

606
00:19:08,020 --> 00:19:09,989
(Why do you always start your skit with a curse word?)

607
00:19:10,619 --> 00:19:13,259
- And she hits me. - Why is that?

608
00:19:13,260 --> 00:19:15,959
- It's all her skits. - Your skits start with cursing.

609
00:19:15,960 --> 00:19:18,172
I wanted to do something I can't do in my skits.

610
00:19:18,500 --> 00:19:21,050
- All the diggers are here. - Okay.

611
00:19:21,569 --> 00:19:23,568
Before we go to our location for the first mission,

612
00:19:23,569 --> 00:19:26,456
- I'll tell you an extra rule. - What is it?

613
00:19:26,470 --> 00:19:27,591
There's an additional rule.

614
00:19:27,740 --> 00:19:29,168
In these eight bags...

615
00:19:29,169 --> 00:19:30,269
(8 of the mission bags are placed in front of them.)

616
00:19:30,270 --> 00:19:31,636
In these eight bags,

617
00:19:31,780 --> 00:19:34,666
- there is a Bomb Sticker. - My gosh.

618
00:19:35,409 --> 00:19:37,608
(There's a Bomb Sticker.)

619
00:19:37,609 --> 00:19:38,670
We have to choose one again?

620
00:19:38,950 --> 00:19:40,118
At the end of the race,

621
00:19:40,119 --> 00:19:42,088
as for the member with the Bomb Sticker,

622
00:19:42,089 --> 00:19:43,588
all the Badges the member has will become Venomous Snake Badges.

623
00:19:43,589 --> 00:19:44,844
- No, no. - My gosh.

624
00:19:45,290 --> 00:19:46,858
All the Badges the member has will become Venomous Snake Badges.

625
00:19:46,859 --> 00:19:48,429
(There will be a flood of bad nicknames.)

626
00:19:48,430 --> 00:19:50,429
- That's the worst. - Only the bad ones will remain.

627
00:19:50,430 --> 00:19:52,858
Therefore, the member who has the Bomb Sticker...

628
00:19:52,859 --> 00:19:55,499
must hide it on another member's body

629
00:19:55,500 --> 00:19:58,068
or bags within an hour.

630
00:19:58,069 --> 00:19:59,835
And if the member fails to give it to someone else,

631
00:20:00,300 --> 00:20:04,138
the member will get a Venomous Snake Badge every hour.

632
00:20:04,139 --> 00:20:05,608
(If the member fails, he or she will get the Venomous Snake Badge.)

633
00:20:06,809 --> 00:20:07,808
I didn't know about that.

634
00:20:07,809 --> 00:20:08,848
(Bomb Sticker and Venomous Snake Badge...)

635
00:20:08,849 --> 00:20:10,808
- That's terrible. - If you're caught...

636
00:20:10,809 --> 00:20:12,179
giving the Sticker to someone else,

637
00:20:12,180 --> 00:20:14,618
the member will get extra Venomous Snake Badge.

638
00:20:14,619 --> 00:20:15,639
(If caught, the member will get extra Venomous Snake Badge.)

639
00:20:15,990 --> 00:20:18,459
After every hour which is the time limit,

640
00:20:18,460 --> 00:20:20,689
everyone will find out if the member gave the Bomb Sticker...

641
00:20:20,690 --> 00:20:22,057
to another member.

642
00:20:22,190 --> 00:20:24,402
- Keep an eye out. - Okay.

643
00:20:24,659 --> 00:20:27,658
All right. You'll draw the bags including the Bomb Sticker now.

644
00:20:27,659 --> 00:20:29,469
Take a bag of your choice.

645
00:20:29,470 --> 00:20:30,668
- I'll take the leftover. - Me too.

646
00:20:30,669 --> 00:20:32,368
(Taking the leftover bags is the best.)

647
00:20:32,369 --> 00:20:33,727
I'm sure Kwang Soo will get it.

648
00:20:33,800 --> 00:20:35,473
- No, no. - I'll take this one.

649
00:20:36,040 --> 00:20:38,009
(When everyone is hesitant because of the Bomb Sticker,)

650
00:20:38,010 --> 00:20:39,808
(Jae Seok picks a bag without any hesitation.)

651
00:20:39,809 --> 00:20:41,473
Jae Seok already took the Bomb Sticker.

652
00:20:41,680 --> 00:20:42,934
We can relax now.

653
00:20:43,050 --> 00:20:44,209
You can relax now.

654
00:20:44,210 --> 00:20:46,519
- I don't feel confident about this. - It's always a lot of pressure.

655
00:20:46,520 --> 00:20:47,540
(Everyone picks a bag.)

656
00:20:47,950 --> 00:20:50,602
The Sticker already left. It left even before I chose mine.

657
00:20:51,659 --> 00:20:53,259
Does everyone have an envelope?

658
00:20:53,260 --> 00:20:55,942
(The members are carefully checking the bags.)

659
00:20:56,730 --> 00:20:57,985
I'm sure I don't have it.

660
00:20:58,129 --> 00:21:01,158
The probability is only 15 percent.

661
00:21:01,500 --> 00:21:02,755
It's 12 percent.

662
00:21:03,230 --> 00:21:06,539
All right. We'll start the timer for the hour.

663
00:21:06,540 --> 00:21:07,568
- Okay. - My gosh.

664
00:21:07,569 --> 00:21:08,838
The timer starts now.

665
00:21:08,839 --> 00:21:11,439
- We'll head there by bus. - Okay.

666
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:13,209
It's just an hour.

667
00:21:13,210 --> 00:21:14,638
But this will be so stressful today.

668
00:21:14,639 --> 00:21:15,878
It's definitely me.

669
00:21:15,879 --> 00:21:17,979
- For an hour... - They'll try to put it on me.

670
00:21:17,980 --> 00:21:19,611
- I have to keep an eye out. - Darn it.

671
00:21:19,750 --> 00:21:21,118
They'll try to put it on me.

672
00:21:21,119 --> 00:21:23,333
(Se Chan taps Jae Seok's back from behind.)

673
00:21:23,389 --> 00:21:24,519
(Keeping his guard)

674
00:21:24,520 --> 00:21:25,641
I just put my hand here.

675
00:21:25,859 --> 00:21:27,858
- Don't be nervous. - Look at him.

676
00:21:28,490 --> 00:21:29,529
Did you hear?

677
00:21:29,530 --> 00:21:30,588
(Everyone gets anxious whenever touched.)

678
00:21:30,589 --> 00:21:32,658
- Do we have to catch that person? - That doesn't matter.

679
00:21:32,659 --> 00:21:34,098
I want you to understand this today.

680
00:21:34,099 --> 00:21:35,529
If you try to put it on me,

681
00:21:35,530 --> 00:21:37,406
I might punch you before I could stop myself.

682
00:21:38,369 --> 00:21:39,699
(He's getting his Honey Punch ready.)

683
00:21:39,700 --> 00:21:42,368
- Your Honey Punch? - It's my reflex.

684
00:21:42,369 --> 00:21:45,297
I'll lick it if you punch me. I'll do that.

685
00:21:45,409 --> 00:21:47,009
- I'll do that if you punch me. - Listen.

686
00:21:47,010 --> 00:21:48,376
- I'll lick your Honey Punch. - Please.

687
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:50,692
- I'll lick it. - Punch in my mouth.

688
00:21:50,780 --> 00:21:51,848
- I'll lick it. - Listen.

689
00:21:51,849 --> 00:21:53,618
- I won't be able to stop myself. - I'll tell you that in advance too.

690
00:21:53,619 --> 00:21:55,589
- I might punch you. - I'll lick it if you do.

691
00:21:55,849 --> 00:21:57,789
(Which one of them has the Bomb Sticker?)

692
00:21:57,790 --> 00:21:58,911
This must be the place.

693
00:21:59,919 --> 00:22:01,347
Let's get off. Here we go.

694
00:22:01,619 --> 00:22:03,158
- I'm sure you have it. - Thank you.

695
00:22:03,159 --> 00:22:04,352
I'm sure you have it.

696
00:22:05,399 --> 00:22:06,999
(They're checking their bodies if they have the Bomb Sticker.)

697
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:08,499
What if I don't have it, Seok Jin?

698
00:22:08,500 --> 00:22:10,029
- I'm sure you have it. - What if I don't?

699
00:22:10,030 --> 00:22:12,009
- I'm 100 percent sure. - What if I don't?

700
00:22:12,270 --> 00:22:14,098
I'm too anxious to even walk around.

701
00:22:14,099 --> 00:22:15,539
- I'm really anxious too. - I don't have it, right?

702
00:22:15,540 --> 00:22:17,308
Why do you always make it hard for us to trust people?

703
00:22:17,309 --> 00:22:19,420
They yell at me when I just tapped them.

704
00:22:19,940 --> 00:22:21,918
Gosh, the sight of it looks so hot.

705
00:22:22,079 --> 00:22:23,908
(The ginseng costume is placed in front of the members.)

706
00:22:23,909 --> 00:22:26,279
(The ginseng costume is placed in front of the members.)

707
00:22:26,280 --> 00:22:28,055
- Goodness, seriously. - Gosh.

708
00:22:28,119 --> 00:22:29,918
- It must be so hot to be inside. - Seriously.

709
00:22:29,919 --> 00:22:31,219
- This is... - It's heavy too.

710
00:22:31,220 --> 00:22:32,858
Isn't this a dolphin?

711
00:22:32,859 --> 00:22:33,888
(At that moment when they're distracted...)

712
00:22:33,889 --> 00:22:35,767
(Surprised)

713
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:37,980
What is it?

714
00:22:38,260 --> 00:22:39,453
- What is it? - No way.

715
00:22:40,129 --> 00:22:41,398
- What? - The first mission is...

716
00:22:41,399 --> 00:22:44,224
You know what? The timing is so weird.

717
00:22:44,430 --> 00:22:46,668
- What do you mean? - I was just kidding.

718
00:22:46,669 --> 00:22:47,721
(What just happened?)

719
00:22:49,309 --> 00:22:50,739
(When Haha yelled earlier,)

720
00:22:50,740 --> 00:22:53,039
(everyone was focused on Haha.)

721
00:22:53,040 --> 00:22:54,739
(At that moment,)

722
00:22:54,740 --> 00:22:56,821
(Jae Seok put something on Seok Jin's bag.)

723
00:22:58,619 --> 00:23:02,464
(Everyone scattered around to check if they had the Bomb Sticker.)

724
00:23:02,950 --> 00:23:05,265
(Jae Seok gets the Bomb Sticker.)

725
00:23:05,619 --> 00:23:07,017
Okay.

726
00:23:07,159 --> 00:23:08,658
- My gosh, this is... - Hey!

727
00:23:08,659 --> 00:23:09,959
(Jae Seok was looking for a chance to move the Bomb Sticker.)

728
00:23:09,960 --> 00:23:11,959
(When Haha drew their attention,)

729
00:23:11,960 --> 00:23:15,265
(he managed to put the Bomb Sticker on Seok Jin.)

730
00:23:16,329 --> 00:23:17,668
- What is it? - No way.

731
00:23:17,669 --> 00:23:20,016
(Jae Seok had the Bomb Sticker.)

732
00:23:20,540 --> 00:23:21,769
(So Min also witnesses the transfer.)

733
00:23:21,770 --> 00:23:23,575
Can you move to the center here?

734
00:23:25,079 --> 00:23:26,915
(I put it on Seok Jin.)

735
00:23:28,210 --> 00:23:29,578
- He put the Sticker on him. - The first mission is...

736
00:23:29,579 --> 00:23:30,709
- On who? - On Seok Jin.

737
00:23:30,710 --> 00:23:32,147
What? Really?

738
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:34,279
(The first mission starts after the Bomb has been transferred.)

739
00:23:34,280 --> 00:23:36,249
You will form 2 teams of 4 members.

740
00:23:36,250 --> 00:23:37,949
You'll invite one merchant.

741
00:23:37,950 --> 00:23:40,689
It's a group match the five of you will have.

742
00:23:40,690 --> 00:23:42,058
- Merchant? - We'll invite a merchant?

743
00:23:42,059 --> 00:23:43,088
It's 4 to 4?

744
00:23:43,089 --> 00:23:44,789
- It will be 5 to 5. - That will be 5 to 5.

745
00:23:44,790 --> 00:23:47,029
The team leader will have a chance...

746
00:23:47,030 --> 00:23:49,628
- to wear the provided costume. - I'd hate that.

747
00:23:49,629 --> 00:23:51,429
(We can't wear that on this hot day.)

748
00:23:51,430 --> 00:23:53,398
- Seok Jin loves being the leader. - But...

749
00:23:53,399 --> 00:23:55,239
- Right? - It's about time he becomes one.

750
00:23:55,240 --> 00:23:57,009
- And he likes that. - Right.

751
00:23:57,010 --> 00:23:58,744
- No, no. I hate being the leader. - Right.

752
00:23:58,879 --> 00:24:00,679
- You must be the authority figure. - I hate being the team leader.

753
00:24:00,680 --> 00:24:02,308
- You should be the leader. - Yes, he ought to.

754
00:24:02,309 --> 00:24:04,217
- No, no. - Let's play Race of Wits.

755
00:24:04,879 --> 00:24:07,118
- It's to pick the team leaders. - Okay. For the team leaders.

756
00:24:07,119 --> 00:24:08,588
- I'll shout number one. - Two people must shout together.

757
00:24:08,589 --> 00:24:09,618
I'll shout number one too.

758
00:24:09,619 --> 00:24:11,249
- Get ready. - I'll say number seven.

759
00:24:11,250 --> 00:24:12,280
- Start. - Seven.

760
00:24:12,659 --> 00:24:13,858
(Hesitating)

761
00:24:13,859 --> 00:24:14,982
One.

762
00:24:15,859 --> 00:24:16,910
- 2. - 3.

763
00:24:17,089 --> 00:24:19,038
(Flinching)

764
00:24:19,800 --> 00:24:21,029
- 4. - 5.

765
00:24:21,030 --> 00:24:22,295
- 6. - 6.

766
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:28,138
(Kwang Soo and Se Chan shouted 6 at the same time.)

767
00:24:28,139 --> 00:24:29,669
Kwang Soo, why did you do that?

768
00:24:29,940 --> 00:24:31,368
Why did you do that?

769
00:24:31,369 --> 00:24:32,502
That was so close.

770
00:24:32,879 --> 00:24:34,308
That was so close.

771
00:24:35,109 --> 00:24:36,878
Okay. Good thing I held back.

772
00:24:36,879 --> 00:24:38,009
I'm glad I held back.

773
00:24:38,010 --> 00:24:39,779
(Team Soo's Ginseng and Team Chan's Ginseng)

774
00:24:39,780 --> 00:24:41,279
- All right. - The youngest members.

775
00:24:41,280 --> 00:24:42,689
Team Soo's Ginseng and Team Chan's Ginseng.

776
00:24:42,690 --> 00:24:43,944
- Team Soo's Ginseng. - Put that on now.

777
00:24:44,250 --> 00:24:46,401
Soo's Ginseng sounds so funny. Soo's Ginseng.

778
00:24:46,889 --> 00:24:49,358
But it's made so that the air is ventilated inside.

779
00:24:49,359 --> 00:24:51,489
- Air can't be ventilated inside! - Right here.

780
00:24:51,490 --> 00:24:53,199
- Right here. - It's so hot in here.

781
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:54,761
- Really? - Right here.

782
00:24:55,629 --> 00:24:57,262
(Just the sight of them is suffocating.)

783
00:24:57,399 --> 00:24:59,848
Gosh, this is so funny. It's so funny.

784
00:25:00,270 --> 00:25:01,901
- Can you move? - Can you move?

785
00:25:02,639 --> 00:25:03,690
Stop it.

786
00:25:04,470 --> 00:25:06,417
Hey. I can't even hear properly.

787
00:25:06,579 --> 00:25:08,170
Hey, Se Chan looks stable in the costume.

788
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:10,656
All right. Go and invite a merchant.

789
00:25:11,149 --> 00:25:13,078
- Come back here with them. - Do we just come back here?

790
00:25:13,079 --> 00:25:14,618
We don't know what we're going to play, right?

791
00:25:14,619 --> 00:25:15,773
- Right. - We don't know that yet.

792
00:25:15,849 --> 00:25:16,949
Let's get going first.

793
00:25:16,950 --> 00:25:18,449
- Who should we invite? - It's really stuffy inside.

794
00:25:18,450 --> 00:25:19,683
Let's go, Ginseng.

795
00:25:20,490 --> 00:25:21,689
There are a lot of interesting things here.

796
00:25:21,690 --> 00:25:23,689
There are a lot of medicinal herbs.

797
00:25:23,690 --> 00:25:24,729
Right.

798
00:25:24,730 --> 00:25:26,499
I've heard of fish mint a lot too.

799
00:25:26,500 --> 00:25:27,628
- Hello. - Gosh, look at that.

800
00:25:27,629 --> 00:25:29,429
- I see ginseng wine. - Right.

801
00:25:29,430 --> 00:25:30,827
There's a lot of stuff. Red ginseng jelly.

802
00:25:30,899 --> 00:25:32,239
- Jelly. - Red ginseng candy.

803
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:33,499
I see red ginseng crackers too.

804
00:25:33,500 --> 00:25:34,568
Crackers?

805
00:25:34,569 --> 00:25:37,239
They have fried ginseng. Let's go over there.

806
00:25:37,240 --> 00:25:38,908
Jae Seok, we have to...

807
00:25:38,909 --> 00:25:40,479
- Right. - invite a merchant.

808
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:42,308
- We just need 1, right? - Just 1.

809
00:25:42,309 --> 00:25:44,949
By the way, since we're here, we should taste one.

810
00:25:44,950 --> 00:25:46,856
I want to taste a fried ginseng. Just one.

811
00:25:46,950 --> 00:25:48,049
- Right? - Right.

812
00:25:48,050 --> 00:25:49,519
- They sell fried ginseng. - Sir, is fried ginseng ready?

813
00:25:50,349 --> 00:25:51,819
- That looks good. - How much is it?

814
00:25:51,889 --> 00:25:53,019
It's a dollar and a half per each.

815
00:25:53,020 --> 00:25:54,588
- Can we get one each? - Thank you.

816
00:25:54,589 --> 00:25:55,689
- Okay. - Thank you.

817
00:25:55,690 --> 00:25:57,729
- Seriously. You're so cool. - My gosh.

818
00:25:57,730 --> 00:25:58,799
Hello.

819
00:25:58,800 --> 00:26:00,055
- My gosh. - Goodness.

820
00:26:00,230 --> 00:26:01,858
Actually, we have to drink...

821
00:26:01,859 --> 00:26:04,529
- ginseng rice wine with this. - That's right. We ought to.

822
00:26:04,530 --> 00:26:05,598
(They also taste rice wine made with ginseng.)

823
00:26:05,599 --> 00:26:07,239
I bet he added ginseng extract.

824
00:26:07,240 --> 00:26:08,269
Look at the color.

825
00:26:08,270 --> 00:26:09,439
- Have a taste. - The color looks different.

826
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:11,918
- Try it with the fried ginseng. - It totally smells like ginseng.

827
00:26:13,579 --> 00:26:14,804
Drink it when the fried ginseng is ready.

828
00:26:16,079 --> 00:26:18,408
(She's drawn to the alcohol like a magnet.)

829
00:26:18,409 --> 00:26:19,979
- Wait for the food. That's a lot. - Drink it with the food.

830
00:26:19,980 --> 00:26:21,918
- Thank you. - These look beautiful.

831
00:26:21,919 --> 00:26:24,118
- I'm curious. - I can smell the ginseng.

832
00:26:24,119 --> 00:26:25,789
- Try it. - Is this made with red ginseng?

833
00:26:25,790 --> 00:26:27,019
- It's red ginseng marmalade. - Red ginseng marmalade.

834
00:26:27,020 --> 00:26:28,588
- Red ginseng marmalade. - That's red ginseng marmalade?

835
00:26:28,589 --> 00:26:29,650
It's not soy sauce.

836
00:26:29,960 --> 00:26:31,158
It's interesting.

837
00:26:31,159 --> 00:26:33,658
(How does it taste?)

838
00:26:33,659 --> 00:26:35,506
(This is awesome.)

839
00:26:36,700 --> 00:26:39,398
I can smell a hint of ginseng.

840
00:26:39,399 --> 00:26:40,469
(The fragrance softly spreads.)

841
00:26:40,470 --> 00:26:41,469
It's savory.

842
00:26:41,470 --> 00:26:43,808
I deep-fry the whole ginseng. The entire root of it.

843
00:26:43,809 --> 00:26:45,239
I've never tasted anything like this.

844
00:26:45,240 --> 00:26:46,667
- My gosh. - It's my first time too.

845
00:26:46,780 --> 00:26:48,108
What an interesting dish.

846
00:26:48,109 --> 00:26:51,078
If you eat the entire root of it, you'll be healthy for a year.

847
00:26:51,079 --> 00:26:52,418
(One root of ginseng for a year?)

848
00:26:52,419 --> 00:26:53,471
(Is he talking big?)

849
00:26:54,450 --> 00:26:57,088
(I know that this is healthy, but that's exaggerating.)

850
00:26:57,089 --> 00:27:00,048
Fried ginseng is no fattening no matter how many you eat.

851
00:27:00,159 --> 00:27:01,259
Ginseng?

852
00:27:01,260 --> 00:27:02,459
But fried food is fattening.

853
00:27:02,460 --> 00:27:03,658
But this isn't fattening.

854
00:27:03,659 --> 00:27:05,638
(He talks big again.)

855
00:27:06,230 --> 00:27:07,628
(He exaggerates about ginseng.)

856
00:27:07,629 --> 00:27:08,956
Fried ginseng isn't fattening.

857
00:27:09,030 --> 00:27:10,229
It's not fattening when it's fried?

858
00:27:10,230 --> 00:27:11,229
(The owner is funny.)

859
00:27:11,230 --> 00:27:12,939
- Sir. - But fried food...

860
00:27:12,940 --> 00:27:13,969
It's very healthy.

861
00:27:13,970 --> 00:27:15,068
- Really? - Yes.

862
00:27:15,069 --> 00:27:17,439
- He's exaggerating. - Since we're on the subject,

863
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:19,179
do you want to go and play a game with us?

864
00:27:19,180 --> 00:27:21,148
- Sure. - He can introduce this place too.

865
00:27:21,240 --> 00:27:23,249
Great. Why don't you join us?

866
00:27:23,250 --> 00:27:24,249
(Can the ginseng preacher show the power of ginseng?)

867
00:27:24,250 --> 00:27:26,219
- This way, please. - Let's go.

868
00:27:26,349 --> 00:27:29,859
All right. We've invited the merchants here.

869
00:27:29,889 --> 00:27:32,358
- Please introduce yourselves. - Okay.

870
00:27:32,359 --> 00:27:35,349
I work at the Fresh Ginseng Center. I'm Gil Tae Hwan.

871
00:27:35,559 --> 00:27:37,529
- Okay. - Mr. Gil.

872
00:27:37,530 --> 00:27:39,060
I'm his wife.

873
00:27:39,329 --> 00:27:41,259
- What's your name? - It's Son Eun Ji.

874
00:27:41,260 --> 00:27:42,529
Ms. Son.

875
00:27:42,530 --> 00:27:44,929
The mission you'll do here with the merchants...

876
00:27:44,930 --> 00:27:47,239
is called Our Drawing Link.

877
00:27:47,240 --> 00:27:49,045
(Our Drawing Link)

878
00:27:49,409 --> 00:27:51,469
It has nothing to do with athletic ability.

879
00:27:51,470 --> 00:27:53,316
- You never know. - Okay.

880
00:27:53,609 --> 00:27:55,039
(Ms. Son from Team Se Chan will play as she's artistic.)

881
00:27:55,040 --> 00:27:56,378
She was good at arts.

882
00:27:56,379 --> 00:27:57,949
If it's about drawing, Jae Seok...

883
00:27:57,950 --> 00:27:59,072
(We're doomed.)

884
00:27:59,349 --> 00:28:02,019
Hey, don't you know that I'm good at drawing?

885
00:28:02,020 --> 00:28:04,029
Everyone told me that my drawing has improved a lot.

886
00:28:04,250 --> 00:28:06,331
(I don't see any improvement.)

887
00:28:06,359 --> 00:28:08,588
And all of my people in the drawing are opening up their arms.

888
00:28:08,589 --> 00:28:09,588
(Everyone opens their arms.)

889
00:28:09,589 --> 00:28:11,229
- No one has joints. - Just like this.

890
00:28:11,230 --> 00:28:12,328
- Like this. - They are straight.

891
00:28:12,329 --> 00:28:13,799
Kwang Soo must be so hot.

892
00:28:13,800 --> 00:28:14,799
They are not team leaders.

893
00:28:14,800 --> 00:28:16,469
- They're doing a penalty. - I think so too.

894
00:28:16,470 --> 00:28:18,068
- It's so hot in here. - Why would team leaders do this?

895
00:28:18,069 --> 00:28:20,168
- They are not team leaders. - How are we the team leaders?

896
00:28:20,169 --> 00:28:22,368
Before we start, you can take off the costumes.

897
00:28:22,369 --> 00:28:24,144
- You guys are about to pass out. - Okay.

898
00:28:24,409 --> 00:28:26,279
- By the way, I've done this before. - Pull the head.

899
00:28:26,280 --> 00:28:27,378
- They are the team leaders. - Lower your head.

900
00:28:27,379 --> 00:28:28,439
Lower your head.

901
00:28:28,440 --> 00:28:29,479
(But Kwang Soo the Ginseng...)

902
00:28:29,480 --> 00:28:30,749
Let's dig out the wild ginseng. One.

903
00:28:30,750 --> 00:28:32,779
Two. I mean, ginseng.

904
00:28:32,780 --> 00:28:33,949
(Crawling)

905
00:28:33,950 --> 00:28:36,031
- Come on. - 1, 2.

906
00:28:36,619 --> 00:28:38,588
Why are you always so clumsy?

907
00:28:38,589 --> 00:28:40,318
(Why are you always so clumsy?)

908
00:28:40,319 --> 00:28:42,158
(How could you call me that?)

909
00:28:42,159 --> 00:28:44,429
You're always so clumsy. Goodness.

910
00:28:44,430 --> 00:28:45,552
Pull out your arms.

911
00:28:45,760 --> 00:28:47,999
- Seriously. - But he's the team leader.

912
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:49,499
- Right. - He's the team leader indeed.

913
00:28:49,500 --> 00:28:50,590
He's sweating a lot.

914
00:28:50,599 --> 00:28:52,028
- He does look like one. - Okay.

915
00:28:52,169 --> 00:28:53,699
All right. I'll give you the rule.

916
00:28:53,700 --> 00:28:56,087
Each team will randomly draw two questions.

917
00:28:56,309 --> 00:28:58,961
You must read the lyrics on the sketchbook.

918
00:28:59,109 --> 00:29:01,709
The four of you will come up with drawings for the lyrics.

919
00:29:01,710 --> 00:29:06,137
The last member must guess either the lyrics or the title.

920
00:29:06,849 --> 00:29:07,979
- Okay. - Okay.

921
00:29:07,980 --> 00:29:09,449
- Okay. Se Chan is good at this. - Hey.

922
00:29:09,450 --> 00:29:10,673
I know new songs.

923
00:29:10,919 --> 00:29:12,215
However,

924
00:29:12,290 --> 00:29:13,959
each member will have...

925
00:29:13,960 --> 00:29:15,828
- only 10 seconds to draw. - See?

926
00:29:15,829 --> 00:29:17,259
- It's so short. How can we do that? - We don't have much time.

927
00:29:17,260 --> 00:29:19,898
But I tend to draw the key features very quickly.

928
00:29:19,899 --> 00:29:22,143
Jae Seok, don't kid yourself. You'll answer the questions.

929
00:29:22,270 --> 00:29:23,898
How dare you think about drawing?

930
00:29:23,899 --> 00:29:25,358
- He'll draw. - Hey, I'm really good at it.

931
00:29:25,369 --> 00:29:27,439
- He always draws Anpanman. - Right.

932
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:28,868
- He was holding a tray. - Come on.

933
00:29:28,869 --> 00:29:30,209
- Do you remember that one? - Right.

934
00:29:30,210 --> 00:29:31,567
You're unbelievable.

935
00:29:32,180 --> 00:29:33,908
(Team Se Chan will start first.)

936
00:29:33,909 --> 00:29:36,648
All right. Everyone, turn around.

937
00:29:36,649 --> 00:29:39,049
We'll show this to the team in the back first.

938
00:29:39,050 --> 00:29:40,203
- Okay. - This is...

939
00:29:40,879 --> 00:29:42,989
the first question. These are the lyrics for it.

940
00:29:42,990 --> 00:29:45,061
(Team Se Chan's first song, "Alone" by Sistar)

941
00:29:45,559 --> 00:29:48,558
(The four of them must draw to express the lyrics in order.)

942
00:29:48,559 --> 00:29:52,658
(The last member must figure out the title or the provided lyrics.)

943
00:29:52,659 --> 00:29:53,679
(I eat alone, watch a movie alone, sing alone, and cry)

944
00:29:53,960 --> 00:29:55,568
(Oh, this is the song.)

945
00:29:55,569 --> 00:29:56,868
- It's hard. - Is it hard?

946
00:29:56,869 --> 00:29:57,929
- Please. - It's hard.

947
00:29:57,930 --> 00:29:58,939
(The lyrics will be hard to draw.)

948
00:29:58,940 --> 00:30:02,269
Each person has 10 seconds. Get ready. Set, go.

949
00:30:02,270 --> 00:30:03,568
("Alone" by SISTAR)

950
00:30:03,569 --> 00:30:05,509
Draw the important parts.

951
00:30:05,510 --> 00:30:06,808
(Oh, it's this song.)

952
00:30:06,809 --> 00:30:10,043
It won't be hard since Jong Kook...

953
00:30:10,349 --> 00:30:12,624
and Haha can draw.

954
00:30:13,149 --> 00:30:15,393
- 3, 2. - Time's up.

955
00:30:15,550 --> 00:30:16,648
- One. - Already?

956
00:30:16,649 --> 00:30:19,058
Time's up. Change. Now it's Haha's turn.

957
00:30:19,059 --> 00:30:21,466
(Jong Kook draws an angry stick figure.)

958
00:30:22,059 --> 00:30:23,658
- Add details to it. - I think...

959
00:30:23,659 --> 00:30:26,791
we should focus on what Jong Kook and Haha drew.

960
00:30:26,859 --> 00:30:28,868
7, 6.

961
00:30:30,069 --> 00:30:33,710
3, 2, 1. Time's up.

962
00:30:34,099 --> 00:30:37,469
(Haha drew a person who is eating alone.)

963
00:30:37,470 --> 00:30:38,469
What is it?

964
00:30:38,470 --> 00:30:39,539
(Seok Jin is next.)

965
00:30:39,540 --> 00:30:43,179
10, 9, 8.

966
00:30:43,180 --> 00:30:45,279
- Seok Jin. - What are you doing?

967
00:30:45,280 --> 00:30:46,779
(Motionless)

968
00:30:46,780 --> 00:30:48,049
- Six. - He doesn't know the song.

969
00:30:48,050 --> 00:30:49,249
- Five. - What is he doing?

970
00:30:49,250 --> 00:30:50,789
You need to keep going.

971
00:30:50,790 --> 00:30:52,728
- Maybe the words are too small. - You need to keep going.

972
00:30:53,260 --> 00:30:54,689
One. Time's up.

973
00:30:54,690 --> 00:30:56,057
What was that?

974
00:30:56,129 --> 00:30:58,959
- 10. - What are you doing?

975
00:30:58,960 --> 00:31:01,203
- 9, 8. - What are you doing?

976
00:31:01,530 --> 00:31:02,769
Seven.

977
00:31:02,770 --> 00:31:05,068
6, 5.

978
00:31:05,069 --> 00:31:06,299
- Four. - That's a nice detail.

979
00:31:06,300 --> 00:31:07,524
- Three. - That's a nice detail.

980
00:31:07,869 --> 00:31:09,668
(She adds a nice detail.)

981
00:31:09,669 --> 00:31:11,168
- That's a nice detail. - This one is hard.

982
00:31:11,169 --> 00:31:14,078
- 1. - The 1st question isn't easy.

983
00:31:14,079 --> 00:31:15,712
- Can I turn around? - You got this.

984
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:17,531
You got this.

985
00:31:18,579 --> 00:31:19,599
What is this?

986
00:31:20,480 --> 00:31:21,479
What is this?

987
00:31:21,480 --> 00:31:22,642
Don't you get it?

988
00:31:22,950 --> 00:31:25,449
Seriously. Although he knows a lot of songs,

989
00:31:25,450 --> 00:31:26,489
his brain doesn't work.

990
00:31:26,490 --> 00:31:28,805
How is my brain supposed to work upon seeing this drawing?

991
00:31:28,859 --> 00:31:32,123
It's a difficult question. It's okay.

992
00:31:32,329 --> 00:31:33,890
It's a difficult question.

993
00:31:33,960 --> 00:31:36,328
- What is 119? - No.

994
00:31:36,329 --> 00:31:37,529
Is there 119?

995
00:31:37,530 --> 00:31:39,398
- 119? - Is there 119?

996
00:31:39,399 --> 00:31:41,612
- 3, 2. - There is no 119.

997
00:31:41,770 --> 00:31:42,860
- One. - Sobangcha.

998
00:31:43,069 --> 00:31:44,969
- Which song? - Last night

999
00:31:44,970 --> 00:31:46,779
- I - It was hard.

1000
00:31:46,780 --> 00:31:48,179
It was "Alone".

1001
00:31:48,180 --> 00:31:49,949
You should have drawn...

1002
00:31:49,950 --> 00:31:51,578
- a television. - Seriously.

1003
00:31:51,579 --> 00:31:53,378
- He didn't do anything. - The lyrics are...

1004
00:31:53,379 --> 00:31:55,789
He behaved like a spy.

1005
00:31:55,790 --> 00:31:58,166
We can't write down numbers.

1006
00:31:58,649 --> 00:32:00,158
Then why did you just sit and stare?

1007
00:32:00,159 --> 00:32:01,547
(It seems like you know the rules very well.)

1008
00:32:02,059 --> 00:32:03,289
What did you do?

1009
00:32:03,290 --> 00:32:05,400
He sat and watched for six seconds.

1010
00:32:05,430 --> 00:32:07,299
- You failed. - This question was hard.

1011
00:32:07,300 --> 00:32:08,858
- It was hard. - Here comes the next question.

1012
00:32:08,859 --> 00:32:11,229
Would you like to change the order?

1013
00:32:11,230 --> 00:32:13,799
- Would you like to guess? - Yes. Because...

1014
00:32:13,800 --> 00:32:15,368
- He can't do it. - It's a bad idea, right?

1015
00:32:15,369 --> 00:32:16,868
Really? Then you should guess.

1016
00:32:17,440 --> 00:32:18,439
That was cute.

1017
00:32:18,440 --> 00:32:20,509
- Should I guess? - Yes.

1018
00:32:20,510 --> 00:32:22,878
- Haha is witty. - Haha is witty.

1019
00:32:22,879 --> 00:32:24,684
- It's the last chance, right? - All right.

1020
00:32:24,809 --> 00:32:26,549
This is the first line of the lyrics.

1021
00:32:26,550 --> 00:32:28,150
I will show you the question first.

1022
00:32:28,450 --> 00:32:31,588
(Team Se Chan's last question)

1023
00:32:31,589 --> 00:32:32,689
(I trusted my friend as much as I trusted you)

1024
00:32:32,690 --> 00:32:36,770
(The biggest hit of the 90s, "Wrongful Encounter" by Kim Gun Mo)

1025
00:32:37,960 --> 00:32:38,959
(Is it this song?)

1026
00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:40,529
- It's so famous. - How will they draw that?

1027
00:32:40,530 --> 00:32:42,529
- This is hard. - It's impossible to draw.

1028
00:32:42,530 --> 00:32:44,429
- Jong Kook, you should guess it. - It's impossible to draw.

1029
00:32:44,430 --> 00:32:46,568
Hold on. Shall we change seats?

1030
00:32:46,569 --> 00:32:47,763
Shall I guess it?

1031
00:32:47,770 --> 00:32:49,568
Would you like to do that? Okay. Let's change seats.

1032
00:32:49,569 --> 00:32:50,868
Okay. Okay.

1033
00:32:50,869 --> 00:32:51,969
- Time out. - Time out.

1034
00:32:51,970 --> 00:32:53,679
- Time out. I will guess it. - Let's change seats.

1035
00:32:53,680 --> 00:32:55,751
- Didn't he see the lyrics? - No, he didn't.

1036
00:32:56,510 --> 00:32:57,709
This is hard.

1037
00:32:57,710 --> 00:32:59,485
- How will they draw that? - Seriously.

1038
00:32:59,619 --> 00:33:01,679
Set, go.

1039
00:33:01,680 --> 00:33:05,627
(I trusted my friend as much as I trusted you)

1040
00:33:05,690 --> 00:33:07,495
- Let's get this right. - That's what you will draw.

1041
00:33:07,960 --> 00:33:10,071
- 5, 4. - This is hard.

1042
00:33:10,490 --> 00:33:12,295
3, 2.

1043
00:33:12,500 --> 00:33:14,396
- That's right. - One. Time's up.

1044
00:33:14,460 --> 00:33:15,521
Pass it to the next person.

1045
00:33:16,869 --> 00:33:20,338
(He drew "Wrongful Encounter" in a witty way.)

1046
00:33:20,339 --> 00:33:21,539
(It's Seok Jin's turn to draw.)

1047
00:33:21,540 --> 00:33:23,168
10, 9.

1048
00:33:23,169 --> 00:33:24,368
Why did you see that?

1049
00:33:24,369 --> 00:33:25,533
(Hold on.)

1050
00:33:27,409 --> 00:33:28,878
- What? - You saw the lyrics.

1051
00:33:28,879 --> 00:33:30,249
- He needs to see the lyrics. - Right.

1052
00:33:30,250 --> 00:33:31,279
(I am sorry.)

1053
00:33:31,280 --> 00:33:33,259
What is wrong with you?

1054
00:33:33,579 --> 00:33:35,219
- I am sorry. - What is wrong with you?

1055
00:33:35,220 --> 00:33:36,289
Why do you think everything Seok Jin does is wrong?

1056
00:33:36,290 --> 00:33:37,648
You did that on purpose, right?

1057
00:33:37,649 --> 00:33:38,918
- Time's up. - I am sorry.

1058
00:33:38,919 --> 00:33:40,489
Seok Jin couldn't draw anything!

1059
00:33:40,490 --> 00:33:41,789
I didn't do it on purpose.

1060
00:33:41,790 --> 00:33:43,289
- Come on. - I am serious.

1061
00:33:43,290 --> 00:33:45,269
I didn't do it on purpose. I am sorry.

1062
00:33:45,530 --> 00:33:48,519
- Seok Jin is a member of this team. - I know.

1063
00:33:48,629 --> 00:33:50,429
(It's Se Chan's turn to draw.)

1064
00:33:50,430 --> 00:33:52,328
- 5, 4. - Why are you drawing another one?

1065
00:33:52,329 --> 00:33:53,799
- Three. - He doesn't work at the market.

1066
00:33:53,800 --> 00:33:55,068
Three people.

1067
00:33:55,069 --> 00:33:56,844
One. Time's up.

1068
00:33:56,869 --> 00:33:58,469
- You didn't draw much. - What is wrong with you?

1069
00:33:58,470 --> 00:33:59,578
- Why did you draw that? - What did you do?

1070
00:33:59,579 --> 00:34:00,878
Ms. Son.

1071
00:34:00,879 --> 00:34:02,679
- What should I do? - Hold on.

1072
00:34:02,680 --> 00:34:04,408
Erase that. Erase the blue stick figure.

1073
00:34:04,409 --> 00:34:05,479
- This one? - Yes.

1074
00:34:05,480 --> 00:34:06,479
(She puts an X-sign over Se Chan's drawing.)

1075
00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:08,387
I can't believe Se Chan.

1076
00:34:08,419 --> 00:34:10,449
- 2, 1. - All right.

1077
00:34:10,450 --> 00:34:12,559
- Make sure you look carefully. - It's all in the drawing.

1078
00:34:12,560 --> 00:34:14,159
It's a national song.

1079
00:34:14,160 --> 00:34:15,788
- Did you draw well? - I drew the lyrics well.

1080
00:34:15,789 --> 00:34:17,259
- He really did. - Did you draw well?

1081
00:34:17,260 --> 00:34:18,588
It's a work of art, right?

1082
00:34:18,589 --> 00:34:20,759
I drew it by myself. No one else drew.

1083
00:34:20,760 --> 00:34:21,759
- That's right. - No one else drew.

1084
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:23,469
- You are right. - No one else drew.

1085
00:34:23,470 --> 00:34:25,408
The two of them should play the game.

1086
00:34:25,499 --> 00:34:27,668
5, 4.

1087
00:34:27,669 --> 00:34:28,668
(He looks at Haha's drawing.)

1088
00:34:28,669 --> 00:34:30,914
3, 2,

1089
00:34:31,370 --> 00:34:33,239
- one. - Kim Gun Mo's "Wrongful Encounter".

1090
00:34:33,240 --> 00:34:35,831
(Kim Gun Mo's "Wrongful Encounter")

1091
00:34:36,149 --> 00:34:37,781
How did he know?

1092
00:34:37,879 --> 00:34:40,648
(The quick-witted Jong Kook gets the answer right.)

1093
00:34:40,649 --> 00:34:42,219
- How did he know? - I got goosebumps.

1094
00:34:42,220 --> 00:34:43,748
- The rest of them didn't help. - I got goosebumps.

1095
00:34:43,749 --> 00:34:44,748
How did he get this right?

1096
00:34:44,749 --> 00:34:46,958
Why did you draw another person? In any case, Jong Kook got it right.

1097
00:34:46,959 --> 00:34:48,918
- Thank goodness. - You are the best.

1098
00:34:48,919 --> 00:34:51,159
Why did you become confused when I drew three people?

1099
00:34:51,160 --> 00:34:54,259
I was trying to draw a more wrongful encounter.

1100
00:34:54,260 --> 00:34:55,586
It's more wrongful if there are four people.

1101
00:34:55,800 --> 00:34:57,799
There are five members in this team,

1102
00:34:57,800 --> 00:34:59,196
but only four of them are happy.

1103
00:34:59,470 --> 00:35:01,599
Aren't you happy? Aren't you happy?

1104
00:35:01,600 --> 00:35:02,938
Let's do a cheer.

1105
00:35:02,939 --> 00:35:04,668
That was incredible.

1106
00:35:04,669 --> 00:35:06,179
Jong Kook is the best.

1107
00:35:06,180 --> 00:35:07,438
We can do this.

1108
00:35:07,439 --> 00:35:08,608
- Let's begin. - Let's go.

1109
00:35:08,609 --> 00:35:10,148
We just need to get two questions right.

1110
00:35:10,149 --> 00:35:12,016
Here comes the question.

1111
00:35:12,249 --> 00:35:14,697
(You watch my rough thoughts and nervous eyes)

1112
00:35:15,379 --> 00:35:19,746
(Yim Jae Beom's masterpiece from the 2000s, "For You")

1113
00:35:19,890 --> 00:35:22,688
My goodness. How will they get it right?

1114
00:35:22,689 --> 00:35:24,363
(What could it be?)

1115
00:35:24,589 --> 00:35:25,958
I will get this right.

1116
00:35:25,959 --> 00:35:27,958
Let's go. So Min, you are first.

1117
00:35:27,959 --> 00:35:29,059
Jae Seok will never get it right.

1118
00:35:29,060 --> 00:35:31,243
- How will they draw it? - Set, go.

1119
00:35:31,300 --> 00:35:33,268
- Do your best. - What?

1120
00:35:33,269 --> 00:35:35,599
(She reads the lyrics and draws quickly.)

1121
00:35:35,600 --> 00:35:38,118
How does she draw so fast?

1122
00:35:38,810 --> 00:35:41,594
(Rough thoughts and nervous eyes)

1123
00:35:41,740 --> 00:35:43,179
Time's up. Pass it to the next member.

1124
00:35:43,180 --> 00:35:44,505
(How did So Min describe the lyrics?)

1125
00:35:45,249 --> 00:35:47,748
(Crying eyes and staring eyes)

1126
00:35:47,749 --> 00:35:49,728
- 10 seconds seemed longer. - Right?

1127
00:35:50,050 --> 00:35:51,748
- Let's go. - 10 seconds seemed longer.

1128
00:35:51,749 --> 00:35:53,458
- Let's go. - Jae Seok won't get this right.

1129
00:35:53,459 --> 00:35:54,958
- One. Time's up. - If Jae Seok gets this right,

1130
00:35:54,959 --> 00:35:56,128
I will acknowledge him as a genius.

1131
00:35:56,129 --> 00:35:57,489
What is that?

1132
00:35:57,490 --> 00:35:58,788
- The singer. - What did he draw?

1133
00:35:58,789 --> 00:36:00,329
I see what he tried to draw.

1134
00:36:00,330 --> 00:36:01,759
It does look like him, but...

1135
00:36:01,760 --> 00:36:03,912
(It's Mr. Lee's turn.)

1136
00:36:05,100 --> 00:36:06,905
- Sir, you need to draw something. - Four.

1137
00:36:07,240 --> 00:36:09,075
Sir, draw something.

1138
00:36:09,310 --> 00:36:10,360
Mr. Lee.

1139
00:36:10,870 --> 00:36:12,369
Why did you draw eyelashes?

1140
00:36:12,370 --> 00:36:13,779
(Hold on.)

1141
00:36:13,780 --> 00:36:15,279
- It's for nervousness. - What?

1142
00:36:15,280 --> 00:36:17,079
- I see. Okay, okay. - 10.

1143
00:36:17,080 --> 00:36:18,279
Mr. Lee.

1144
00:36:18,280 --> 00:36:20,288
- Stop talking. - 8, 7.

1145
00:36:20,550 --> 00:36:22,688
(How will I wrap up this drawing?)

1146
00:36:22,689 --> 00:36:24,489
4, 3.

1147
00:36:24,490 --> 00:36:26,091
- What is Ji Hyo doing? - What is that?

1148
00:36:26,319 --> 00:36:27,759
- One. Time's up. - What is that?

1149
00:36:27,760 --> 00:36:28,913
It's about watching.

1150
00:36:29,890 --> 00:36:31,389
How will he get it right?

1151
00:36:31,390 --> 00:36:32,599
(Will Jae Seok be able to get this right?)

1152
00:36:32,600 --> 00:36:33,929
(It's a total disaster.)

1153
00:36:33,930 --> 00:36:35,659
- This is... - This is impossible.

1154
00:36:35,660 --> 00:36:37,301
- He won't get it right. - Jae Seok.

1155
00:36:37,370 --> 00:36:38,969
- I was in a hurry. - What is this?

1156
00:36:38,970 --> 00:36:39,969
How am I supposed to...

1157
00:36:39,970 --> 00:36:41,538
- Still... - It was the hardest question.

1158
00:36:41,539 --> 00:36:43,608
Jae Seok, look at the message.

1159
00:36:43,609 --> 00:36:44,969
Look. There are tears, right?

1160
00:36:44,970 --> 00:36:45,978
(He tries to gain information.)

1161
00:36:45,979 --> 00:36:47,478
You can't have a conversation.

1162
00:36:47,479 --> 00:36:49,079
(You can't have a conversation.)

1163
00:36:49,080 --> 00:36:51,248
- You can't exchange looks. - I didn't do anything.

1164
00:36:51,249 --> 00:36:52,648
Keep your eyes on the front and say the answer.

1165
00:36:52,649 --> 00:36:53,779
Seriously.

1166
00:36:53,780 --> 00:36:55,860
I need to solve this by myself.

1167
00:36:56,149 --> 00:36:58,549
Is this arrow for these eyes?

1168
00:36:58,550 --> 00:36:59,688
(Think differently.)

1169
00:36:59,689 --> 00:37:01,518
Hold on.

1170
00:37:01,519 --> 00:37:02,958
- Stop it. - Seriously.

1171
00:37:02,959 --> 00:37:04,759
What are you doing?

1172
00:37:04,760 --> 00:37:07,259
- Turn around. - Turn around. What are you doing?

1173
00:37:07,260 --> 00:37:10,168
5, 4, 3,

1174
00:37:10,169 --> 00:37:12,168
- two... - "With..."

1175
00:37:12,430 --> 00:37:14,168
- One. - "With My Tears".

1176
00:37:14,169 --> 00:37:15,168
("With My Tears")

1177
00:37:15,169 --> 00:37:16,409
(Incorrect)

1178
00:37:16,410 --> 00:37:17,568
It's incorrect.

1179
00:37:17,569 --> 00:37:19,878
(You watch my rough thoughts)

1180
00:37:19,879 --> 00:37:23,214
- How could this drawing be... - And nervous eyes

1181
00:37:24,450 --> 00:37:27,478
(Look at the drawing carefully.)

1182
00:37:27,479 --> 00:37:30,849
(There are nervous eyes...)

1183
00:37:30,850 --> 00:37:33,848
(and another set of eyes which watches on.)

1184
00:37:34,689 --> 00:37:37,688
(Why couldn't you figure it out?)

1185
00:37:37,689 --> 00:37:40,688
Is this the person who is watching?

1186
00:37:41,459 --> 00:37:43,068
- Look here. - What is this?

1187
00:37:43,069 --> 00:37:44,699
It's Yim Jae Beom.

1188
00:37:44,700 --> 00:37:46,066
(Kwang Soo is confident.)

1189
00:37:46,769 --> 00:37:48,699
(Is this Yim Jae Beom?)

1190
00:37:48,700 --> 00:37:49,893
It looks like him.

1191
00:37:49,970 --> 00:37:51,608
- That's right. - He has a mustache.

1192
00:37:51,609 --> 00:37:52,878
- It does look like him. - See?

1193
00:37:52,879 --> 00:37:55,838
Empty a seat. I will draw. Who will guess the answer?

1194
00:37:55,979 --> 00:37:57,779
- So Min, guess the answer. - Make it simple.

1195
00:37:57,780 --> 00:37:59,349
The first person is important.

1196
00:37:59,350 --> 00:38:00,549
- By the way, - So Min.

1197
00:38:00,550 --> 00:38:03,549
Sir. Why did you draw eyelashes?

1198
00:38:03,550 --> 00:38:05,748
- Tears. - They represent the state of mind.

1199
00:38:05,749 --> 00:38:07,788
- The nervousness. - Eyelashes are a bit...

1200
00:38:07,789 --> 00:38:09,588
- So Min, Mr. Lee's drawing is blue. - Okay.

1201
00:38:09,589 --> 00:38:10,788
(So Min, Mr. Lee's drawing is blue.)

1202
00:38:10,789 --> 00:38:12,288
- Pretend it's never there. - I will keep that in mind.

1203
00:38:12,289 --> 00:38:14,059
Hey, hey. Don't do that.

1204
00:38:14,060 --> 00:38:16,228
- The blue marker is transparent. - Okay.

1205
00:38:16,229 --> 00:38:17,668
Let's put our hands together.

1206
00:38:17,669 --> 00:38:18,799
- Let's go. - One.

1207
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:20,299
- Let's go. - 1, 2, 3.

1208
00:38:20,300 --> 00:38:22,038
- Let's go. - We will win.

1209
00:38:22,039 --> 00:38:23,438
It's a matter of getting one question right.

1210
00:38:23,439 --> 00:38:24,668
- Let's go. - Good luck.

1211
00:38:24,669 --> 00:38:26,618
This is the question.

1212
00:38:26,910 --> 00:38:29,239
(Team Kwang Soo's last question)

1213
00:38:29,240 --> 00:38:30,579
(Tonight, the star is me, pick me, pick me)

1214
00:38:30,580 --> 00:38:34,017
("Pick Me" by Wanna One was the hottest song in 2017.)

1215
00:38:34,749 --> 00:38:37,389
- Gosh, this one is easy. - This one is easy.

1216
00:38:37,390 --> 00:38:38,748
Is it really easy?

1217
00:38:38,749 --> 00:38:39,958
It's easy.

1218
00:38:39,959 --> 00:38:41,518
Jae Seok, you will go first. Get ready.

1219
00:38:41,519 --> 00:38:43,228
- All right. - How will he draw that?

1220
00:38:43,229 --> 00:38:44,587
- I wouldn't know what to do. - Go.

1221
00:38:44,789 --> 00:38:46,738
(Let's see.)

1222
00:38:47,499 --> 00:38:48,659
Gosh, it's this song.

1223
00:38:48,660 --> 00:38:50,068
- It's easy. - It's so easy.

1224
00:38:50,069 --> 00:38:51,568
- It's easy. - It's easy.

1225
00:38:51,569 --> 00:38:53,768
- So Min will get it right. - That drawing is a disaster.

1226
00:38:53,769 --> 00:38:55,299
(That drawing is a disaster.)

1227
00:38:55,300 --> 00:38:56,768
That drawing is a disaster.

1228
00:38:56,769 --> 00:38:58,668
- What is that? - One. Time's up.

1229
00:38:58,669 --> 00:38:59,779
- We are set. - We are set.

1230
00:38:59,780 --> 00:39:00,779
What is that?

1231
00:39:00,780 --> 00:39:05,679
(It does look like a person if you look closely.)

1232
00:39:05,680 --> 00:39:07,478
Is that person eating carp bread?

1233
00:39:07,479 --> 00:39:10,304
- He drew a carp. - That person is eating carp bread.

1234
00:39:10,519 --> 00:39:12,858
- Carp bread. - What is that?

1235
00:39:12,859 --> 00:39:13,879
One. Time's up.

1236
00:39:14,260 --> 00:39:15,759
- There you go. - What is that?

1237
00:39:15,760 --> 00:39:17,218
- The drawing is perfect now. - All right.

1238
00:39:17,430 --> 00:39:18,960
It was carp bread.

1239
00:39:20,260 --> 00:39:22,228
(It's Mr. Lee's turn.)

1240
00:39:22,229 --> 00:39:24,068
- Sir, draw. Draw something. - Sir.

1241
00:39:24,069 --> 00:39:25,929
Sir, draw something.

1242
00:39:25,930 --> 00:39:27,020
Do something.

1243
00:39:27,069 --> 00:39:28,369
- One. Time's up. - What?

1244
00:39:28,370 --> 00:39:30,349
- What is that? - What is that?

1245
00:39:30,569 --> 00:39:31,938
Sir, why did you do that?

1246
00:39:31,939 --> 00:39:33,337
(I am sorry I don't know the song.)

1247
00:39:34,010 --> 00:39:35,378
(Ji Hyo is the last member.)

1248
00:39:35,379 --> 00:39:37,349
- That person is eating carp bread. - My goodness.

1249
00:39:37,350 --> 00:39:38,509
(It looks like she drew the moon.)

1250
00:39:38,510 --> 00:39:39,549
What?

1251
00:39:39,550 --> 00:39:41,518
Out of all the shapes of the moon...

1252
00:39:42,149 --> 00:39:44,842
- So Min, guess the answer. - Is it my turn?

1253
00:39:45,289 --> 00:39:46,389
Look at the important parts.

1254
00:39:46,390 --> 00:39:47,759
Look at the background.

1255
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:48,788
- But... - It's easy.

1256
00:39:48,789 --> 00:39:50,217
- What is this? - You can get this right.

1257
00:39:50,859 --> 00:39:52,053
It's easy.

1258
00:39:52,899 --> 00:39:54,628
I'm the best.

1259
00:39:54,629 --> 00:39:55,659
Pick me.

1260
00:39:55,660 --> 00:39:57,299
I'm the best.

1261
00:39:57,300 --> 00:39:58,421
Pick me.

1262
00:40:00,399 --> 00:40:01,998
(Did So Min get it?)

1263
00:40:01,999 --> 00:40:03,090
Pick me

1264
00:40:03,169 --> 00:40:04,369
(That's it.)

1265
00:40:04,370 --> 00:40:06,338
You have to either sing the lyrics correctly...

1266
00:40:06,339 --> 00:40:07,708
or say the correct title.

1267
00:40:07,709 --> 00:40:11,147
- You have two options. - Tonight, the star is me

1268
00:40:12,819 --> 00:40:14,779
- Pick me, pick me - What comes next?

1269
00:40:14,780 --> 00:40:17,949
(She skipped the third line.)

1270
00:40:17,950 --> 00:40:19,897
(What were the lyrics?)

1271
00:40:19,990 --> 00:40:21,755
(You're almost there.)

1272
00:40:22,689 --> 00:40:25,858
Tonight, the star is me

1273
00:40:25,859 --> 00:40:26,958
Are you singing a round?

1274
00:40:26,959 --> 00:40:28,387
What are you doing?

1275
00:40:28,629 --> 00:40:30,029
You have to either say the title...

1276
00:40:30,030 --> 00:40:31,661
- or sing the whole lyrics. - Are you singing a round?

1277
00:40:31,769 --> 00:40:33,534
- Is it okay to say the title? - You can say the title too.

1278
00:40:33,839 --> 00:40:34,869
(It's okay to just say the title.)

1279
00:40:34,870 --> 00:40:35,920
Tonight...

1280
00:40:36,439 --> 00:40:38,409
I don't know the title. What should I do?

1281
00:40:38,410 --> 00:40:39,970
(I don't know the title. What should I do?)

1282
00:40:41,310 --> 00:40:43,217
- What? - I don't know the title.

1283
00:40:43,680 --> 00:40:44,935
What should I do?

1284
00:40:45,010 --> 00:40:46,349
- What? - Be quiet.

1285
00:40:46,350 --> 00:40:47,549
She doesn't know the title?

1286
00:40:47,550 --> 00:40:49,179
- Be quiet. - Isn't that strange?

1287
00:40:49,180 --> 00:40:51,518
Tonight, the star is me

1288
00:40:51,519 --> 00:40:52,889
(She repeats the same part over and over again.)

1289
00:40:52,890 --> 00:40:54,619
- Are you Ppak Gu? - Hurry up...

1290
00:40:54,620 --> 00:40:56,730
and make up your mind.

1291
00:40:56,760 --> 00:40:58,320
It's you, it's you

1292
00:40:58,330 --> 00:40:59,958
What's the title? I don't remember it.

1293
00:40:59,959 --> 00:41:01,398
- I don't know the title. - That's so funny.

1294
00:41:01,399 --> 00:41:03,134
- I don't know the title. - The title is...

1295
00:41:03,200 --> 00:41:05,067
- "Pick Me". - It's "Pick Me".

1296
00:41:05,569 --> 00:41:07,869
(She's been saying, "Pick me", so many times.)

1297
00:41:07,870 --> 00:41:09,430
She kept saying, "Pick me".

1298
00:41:09,669 --> 00:41:11,338
She kept saying, "Pick me".

1299
00:41:11,339 --> 00:41:12,739
That's so funny.

1300
00:41:12,740 --> 00:41:14,953
She said, "Pick me", more than 30 times.

1301
00:41:15,109 --> 00:41:16,978
What did you do?

1302
00:41:16,979 --> 00:41:18,009
The title...

1303
00:41:18,010 --> 00:41:19,049
You didn't know the title?

1304
00:41:19,050 --> 00:41:20,886
- Is the title "Pick Me"? - Yes.

1305
00:41:20,919 --> 00:41:22,889
- Kwang Soo did a good job. - My drawing was on point.

1306
00:41:22,890 --> 00:41:24,688
I figured it out thanks to this.

1307
00:41:24,689 --> 00:41:25,873
The hand? Kwang Soo drew it.

1308
00:41:26,120 --> 00:41:27,159
Jae Seok.

1309
00:41:27,160 --> 00:41:28,342
Is that a thumb?

1310
00:41:29,260 --> 00:41:30,515
Is that a thumb?

1311
00:41:30,560 --> 00:41:31,682
- It's a thumb. - That's so...

1312
00:41:31,830 --> 00:41:33,767
- This is a thumb? - Yes.

1313
00:41:33,899 --> 00:41:35,429
It says, "Pick me."

1314
00:41:35,499 --> 00:41:37,539
I thought he was holding a club.

1315
00:41:37,800 --> 00:41:39,840
- Isn't it a fried ginseng? - No.

1316
00:41:39,939 --> 00:41:41,038
It isn't.

1317
00:41:41,039 --> 00:41:42,672
I thought they were going to get it right.

1318
00:41:42,700 --> 00:41:44,810
- We win. - We win.

1319
00:41:45,269 --> 00:41:47,239
- We win again. - Okay.

1320
00:41:47,240 --> 00:41:49,409
The winning team of Our Drawing Link﻿ is...

1321
00:41:49,410 --> 00:41:51,449
Team Se Chan.

1322
00:41:51,450 --> 00:41:53,349
(Team Se Chan can take one Ginseng Badge.)

1323
00:41:53,350 --> 00:41:54,910
It's simple.

1324
00:41:55,149 --> 00:41:56,781
"Wrongful Encounter﻿" was incredible.

1325
00:41:57,350 --> 00:42:00,619
While you were enjoying the game, the time limit has passed.

1326
00:42:00,620 --> 00:42:02,150
- That's right. - Finally.

1327
00:42:02,189 --> 00:42:04,188
(It's been an hour...)

1328
00:42:04,189 --> 00:42:06,912
(since Jae Seok transferred the Bomb Sticker to Seok Jin.)

1329
00:42:07,800 --> 00:42:09,429
(If you carry the Bomb Sticker for an hour,)

1330
00:42:09,430 --> 00:42:11,337
(you automatically get another Venomous Snake Badge.)

1331
00:42:11,399 --> 00:42:13,668
(If the Bomb Sticker is still with Seok Jin,)

1332
00:42:13,669 --> 00:42:16,149
(he'll get another Venomous Snake Badge.)

1333
00:42:16,740 --> 00:42:17,861
The bomb...

1334
00:42:19,039 --> 00:42:20,909
has been transferred.

1335
00:42:20,910 --> 00:42:22,038
When?

1336
00:42:22,039 --> 00:42:23,748
(The Bomb Sticker has been transferred.)

1337
00:42:23,749 --> 00:42:24,878
When?

1338
00:42:24,879 --> 00:42:26,978
(Seok Jin transferred the bomb...)

1339
00:42:26,979 --> 00:42:29,079
(to another person.)

1340
00:42:29,080 --> 00:42:30,141
That was so fast.

1341
00:42:30,450 --> 00:42:32,288
- What? - What?

1342
00:42:32,289 --> 00:42:34,719
(Who is carrying the bomb?)

1343
00:42:34,720 --> 00:42:35,841
There was no time to transfer it.

1344
00:42:36,629 --> 00:42:40,129
(When Jae Seok transferred the Bomb Sticker to Seok Jin,)

1345
00:42:42,660 --> 00:42:44,628
(Seok Jin noticed it right away.)

1346
00:42:44,629 --> 00:42:46,869
(Seok Jin knows...)

1347
00:42:46,870 --> 00:42:49,145
(Jae Seok transferred the Bomb Sticker to him.)

1348
00:42:49,870 --> 00:42:52,168
(Before the mission started,)

1349
00:42:52,169 --> 00:42:54,608
(Seok Jin took action.)

1350
00:42:54,609 --> 00:42:59,373
(He transferred the bomb onto Kwang Soo's shoe.)

1351
00:43:00,749 --> 00:43:02,617
(You'll never figure it out.)

1352
00:43:03,620 --> 00:43:06,445
(As Seok Jin expected, Kwang Soo has no idea.)

1353
00:43:06,720 --> 00:43:08,518
- So fast? - The new person...

1354
00:43:08,519 --> 00:43:09,753
has an hour from now.

1355
00:43:10,060 --> 00:43:11,128
It's been transferred?

1356
00:43:11,129 --> 00:43:12,929
If the Bomb Sticker is not transferred within an hour,

1357
00:43:12,930 --> 00:43:15,029
the person will get another Venomous Snake Badge.

1358
00:43:15,030 --> 00:43:16,599
(If Kwang Soo fails, he'll get another Venomous Snake Badge.)

1359
00:43:16,600 --> 00:43:17,628
I have to find it.

1360
00:43:17,629 --> 00:43:18,690
(Will he be able to transfer the Bomb Sticker within an hour?)

1361
00:43:19,740 --> 00:43:22,290
(The time limit for Kwang Soo)

1362
00:43:23,039 --> 00:43:24,539
- Are we having lunch? - I'm hungry.

1363
00:43:24,740 --> 00:43:27,127
I laughed so much before we got on the bus.

1364
00:43:27,310 --> 00:43:29,217
- "You're not stupid!" - "You're not stupid!"

1365
00:43:29,439 --> 00:43:30,572
Who was she talking to?

1366
00:43:30,780 --> 00:43:31,779
Kwang Soo.

1367
00:43:31,780 --> 00:43:33,554
(What happened?)

1368
00:43:34,220 --> 00:43:35,248
(They were on their way to the next mission.)

1369
00:43:35,249 --> 00:43:36,647
You're not stupid!

1370
00:43:36,819 --> 00:43:38,451
You're not stupid!

1371
00:43:38,550 --> 00:43:41,088
"You're not stupid!"

1372
00:43:41,089 --> 00:43:42,088
Without realizing it,

1373
00:43:42,089 --> 00:43:43,109
I said, "Thank you!"

1374
00:43:43,189 --> 00:43:44,728
"You're not stupid!"

1375
00:43:44,729 --> 00:43:46,128
Why would she say such an obvious thing?

1376
00:43:46,129 --> 00:43:47,894
(Kwang Soo was touched by the female fan.)

1377
00:43:48,660 --> 00:43:49,869
(They start looking for the Bomb Sticker again.)

1378
00:43:49,870 --> 00:43:50,920
I don't have it.

1379
00:43:51,800 --> 00:43:52,891
Who has it?

1380
00:43:53,169 --> 00:43:54,221
It's been transferred.

1381
00:43:54,439 --> 00:43:55,668
Where could it be?

1382
00:43:55,669 --> 00:43:56,809
(I'm sorry, Kwang Soo. You won't be able to find it.)

1383
00:43:56,810 --> 00:43:58,838
- I want to know. - We can't see our backs.

1384
00:43:58,839 --> 00:44:01,509
- We can't ask others either. - Someone must be feeling nervous.

1385
00:44:01,510 --> 00:44:03,208
If the cameras are off...

1386
00:44:03,209 --> 00:44:05,779
and you don't film it with your phone...

1387
00:44:05,780 --> 00:44:06,818
It has to be filmed.

1388
00:44:06,819 --> 00:44:08,119
You have to film it with your phone at least.

1389
00:44:08,120 --> 00:44:09,688
It has to be filmed?

1390
00:44:09,689 --> 00:44:12,389
(Seok Jin suddenly asks a question.)

1391
00:44:12,390 --> 00:44:13,787
- It has to air. - Why?

1392
00:44:13,890 --> 00:44:14,940
Are you worried?

1393
00:44:15,620 --> 00:44:16,710
You didn't film it?

1394
00:44:17,030 --> 00:44:18,050
Well...

1395
00:44:18,660 --> 00:44:20,495
Don't think I did it.

1396
00:44:20,830 --> 00:44:22,085
Why are you so upset?

1397
00:44:22,229 --> 00:44:23,969
You should at least tell the producer.

1398
00:44:23,970 --> 00:44:25,029
- Right. - If...

1399
00:44:25,030 --> 00:44:27,794
Let's say it wasn't filmed. Do we have to retrieve the bomb?

1400
00:44:28,100 --> 00:44:29,299
Are you in that situation right now?

1401
00:44:29,300 --> 00:44:30,708
(Jae Seok teases Seok Jin.)

1402
00:44:30,709 --> 00:44:32,739
- Let's just assume that. - I'm sure it was filmed.

1403
00:44:32,740 --> 00:44:34,851
- You can see it if you zoom in. - Were there no cameras at all?

1404
00:44:35,339 --> 00:44:36,982
- What? - Were there no cameras at all?

1405
00:44:37,350 --> 00:44:39,248
Don't think I did it.

1406
00:44:39,249 --> 00:44:40,349
If the person...

1407
00:44:40,350 --> 00:44:41,809
It's too late now.

1408
00:44:42,050 --> 00:44:44,719
Who did you give it to and when?

1409
00:44:44,720 --> 00:44:46,119
Say, "If a friend of mine..."

1410
00:44:46,120 --> 00:44:48,989
If the person...

1411
00:44:48,990 --> 00:44:50,358
- Seok Jin. - Yes?

1412
00:44:50,359 --> 00:44:52,533
As long as the result is filmed, it'll be fine.

1413
00:44:52,830 --> 00:44:54,462
And you have to tell the staff.

1414
00:44:54,830 --> 00:44:56,289
- Of course. - You have to tell the staff.

1415
00:44:56,629 --> 00:44:57,668
"I transferred it."

1416
00:44:57,669 --> 00:44:59,465
I'm sure that friend told the staff.

1417
00:44:59,629 --> 00:45:01,498
- Did you? - I'm sure he did.

1418
00:45:01,499 --> 00:45:02,739
A friend of yours?

1419
00:45:02,740 --> 00:45:03,809
- I mean... - Your friend did it?

1420
00:45:03,810 --> 00:45:05,469
a friend of mine that I'm as close to as myself.

1421
00:45:05,470 --> 00:45:06,608
(He confesses.)

1422
00:45:06,609 --> 00:45:08,679
(Seok Jin's best friend is Seok Jin.)

1423
00:45:08,680 --> 00:45:10,383
- A close friend of yours? - Yes.

1424
00:45:11,249 --> 00:45:12,474
Where could it be?

1425
00:45:13,080 --> 00:45:14,712
Mouth Like Mount Baekdu was so funny.

1426
00:45:15,019 --> 00:45:17,334
Mouth Like Mount Baekdu and Mount Halla.

1427
00:45:17,649 --> 00:45:19,149
So Min sure is a poet.

1428
00:45:19,249 --> 00:45:20,442
It was amazing.

1429
00:45:20,519 --> 00:45:23,111
I didn't mean to see it, but...

1430
00:45:24,560 --> 00:45:25,814
(Did So Min see anything?)

1431
00:45:25,959 --> 00:45:27,592
I saw Seok Jin's phone.

1432
00:45:27,700 --> 00:45:29,057
- Be quiet. - What happened?

1433
00:45:29,629 --> 00:45:32,329
- Be quiet. - He was messaging...

1434
00:45:32,330 --> 00:45:34,135
Running Man Producer Jung Chul Min.

1435
00:45:34,169 --> 00:45:35,639
- Be quiet. - You just messaged him, right?

1436
00:45:35,640 --> 00:45:37,239
- I didn't. - You did.

1437
00:45:37,240 --> 00:45:38,309
Be quiet.

1438
00:45:38,310 --> 00:45:42,727
(He clenches his teeth.)

1439
00:45:42,780 --> 00:45:43,949
Seriously.

1440
00:45:43,950 --> 00:45:46,349
- What are you doing? - Please make it fun.

1441
00:45:46,350 --> 00:45:48,619
Please don't get caught.

1442
00:45:48,620 --> 00:45:49,619
I'm sorry to say this,

1443
00:45:49,620 --> 00:45:51,088
but just because your sight is dim...

1444
00:45:51,089 --> 00:45:52,518
doesn't mean that no one can see your phone.

1445
00:45:52,519 --> 00:45:54,764
It's just that your sight is dim.

1446
00:45:54,789 --> 00:45:57,389
- I saw it so clearly. - We all can see it clearly.

1447
00:45:57,390 --> 00:45:59,228
I couldn't help but see it.

1448
00:45:59,229 --> 00:46:01,811
Hide your phone more properly.

1449
00:46:01,830 --> 00:46:03,099
Seok Jin must have transferred the bomb...

1450
00:46:03,100 --> 00:46:05,329
to someone he thinks is easy.

1451
00:46:05,330 --> 00:46:06,398
Who could that be?

1452
00:46:06,399 --> 00:46:09,195
(Will Kwang Soo be able to find the bomb?)

1453
00:46:09,370 --> 00:46:11,409
- Hello. - Hello.

1454
00:46:11,410 --> 00:46:13,478
(They arrive at a restaurant with a nice view.)

1455
00:46:13,479 --> 00:46:14,632
Is it indoors?

1456
00:46:15,510 --> 00:46:17,309
Let me look in the mirror.

1457
00:46:17,310 --> 00:46:18,978
I want to go to the bathroom.

1458
00:46:18,979 --> 00:46:21,148
(Do I have the Bomb Sticker?)

1459
00:46:21,149 --> 00:46:22,404
Where could it be?

1460
00:46:24,950 --> 00:46:27,989
- Kwang Saeng. - Yam Saeng.

1461
00:46:27,990 --> 00:46:29,829
Yam Saeng. Kwang Saeng.

1462
00:46:29,830 --> 00:46:30,858
Nam Saeng.

1463
00:46:30,859 --> 00:46:32,696
Kwang Soo is suspicious of something.

1464
00:46:32,760 --> 00:46:37,216
- The time limit has passed again. - Again?

1465
00:46:37,430 --> 00:46:40,268
(The time limit has passed.)

1466
00:46:40,269 --> 00:46:42,168
- Again? - Already?

1467
00:46:42,169 --> 00:46:44,108
The Bomb Sticker has not been...

1468
00:46:44,109 --> 00:46:45,874
- transferred yet. - What?

1469
00:46:46,039 --> 00:46:47,815
- The person doesn't know? - The person doesn't know.

1470
00:46:47,839 --> 00:46:51,247
That person gets another Venomous Snake Badge in secret.

1471
00:46:51,280 --> 00:46:52,535
- What? - How can we not know?

1472
00:46:52,709 --> 00:46:53,779
That's absurd.

1473
00:46:53,780 --> 00:46:55,018
I can't understand it.

1474
00:46:55,019 --> 00:46:57,188
Anyway, I've just texted the person.

1475
00:46:57,189 --> 00:46:58,549
- You did? - Yes.

1476
00:46:58,550 --> 00:47:01,273
(The person with the bomb has been informed.)

1477
00:47:01,319 --> 00:47:02,619
(Everyone checks his or her phone anxiously.)

1478
00:47:02,620 --> 00:47:03,956
An hour has passed already?

1479
00:47:04,600 --> 00:47:07,323
(The person with the bomb has been informed.)

1480
00:47:07,369 --> 00:47:08,669
(Everyone checks his or her phone anxiously.)

1481
00:47:08,670 --> 00:47:10,006
An hour has passed already?

1482
00:47:10,448 --> 00:47:11,846
You better keep it secret...

1483
00:47:11,847 --> 00:47:13,521
if you want to transfer the bomb to another person.

1484
00:47:13,818 --> 00:47:14,987
(Kwang Soo's lips twitch.)

1485
00:47:14,988 --> 00:47:16,656
That person knows it now, right?

1486
00:47:16,657 --> 00:47:18,258
(Staring)

1487
00:47:18,457 --> 00:47:20,130
What's wrong with your lips?

1488
00:47:20,727 --> 00:47:21,982
- What's wrong? - What's wrong?

1489
00:47:22,298 --> 00:47:23,496
- What happened to your lips? - What happened?

1490
00:47:23,497 --> 00:47:25,467
- Is it you? - No.

1491
00:47:25,568 --> 00:47:27,366
If that person fails to find the Bomb Sticker within an hour,

1492
00:47:27,367 --> 00:47:28,496
he or she will get another Venomous Snake Badge.

1493
00:47:28,497 --> 00:47:29,536
(The producer tries hard not to laugh.)

1494
00:47:29,537 --> 00:47:30,936
Check the soles of your feet.

1495
00:47:30,937 --> 00:47:32,406
(Haha talks to Kwang Soo.)

1496
00:47:32,407 --> 00:47:34,177
What's wrong?

1497
00:47:34,178 --> 00:47:35,177
Can I use the bathroom?

1498
00:47:35,178 --> 00:47:36,947
(Let me look for the bomb.)

1499
00:47:36,948 --> 00:47:38,029
What's wrong?

1500
00:47:38,148 --> 00:47:39,817
- We're shooting. - Why?

1501
00:47:39,818 --> 00:47:41,116
- All right. - Okay.

1502
00:47:41,117 --> 00:47:42,147
You should focus on the shooting.

1503
00:47:42,148 --> 00:47:43,208
Focus.

1504
00:47:43,617 --> 00:47:45,218
I guess someone will have difficulty focusing.

1505
00:47:45,418 --> 00:47:47,717
In this mission, you'll compete...

1506
00:47:47,718 --> 00:47:49,116
for the badge exchange rights and a meal.

1507
00:47:49,117 --> 00:47:50,226
It's called Mystery Seller.

1508
00:47:50,227 --> 00:47:51,452
- What's that? - Let's eat.

1509
00:47:51,887 --> 00:47:54,897
Without knowing what's in the box,

1510
00:47:54,898 --> 00:47:57,897
one team will describe the item for three minutes.

1511
00:47:57,898 --> 00:48:00,723
The other team can see the item...

1512
00:48:00,767 --> 00:48:03,358
and ask the sellers questions about the item freely.

1513
00:48:03,367 --> 00:48:05,706
The staff will determine how well the sellers described the item.

1514
00:48:05,707 --> 00:48:07,849
The team with the highest score wins.

1515
00:48:09,207 --> 00:48:10,206
That sounds fun.

1516
00:48:10,207 --> 00:48:11,206
It's just like home shopping channels.

1517
00:48:11,207 --> 00:48:12,777
For example, you may ask,

1518
00:48:12,778 --> 00:48:14,217
"When do you give this as a present?"

1519
00:48:14,218 --> 00:48:15,917
- Okay. - It's going to be fun.

1520
00:48:15,918 --> 00:48:17,116
Kwang Soo, will you focus? What's wrong with you?

1521
00:48:17,117 --> 00:48:18,717
- Are you okay? - He wasn't focusing?

1522
00:48:18,718 --> 00:48:20,417
- Is something wrong? - No.

1523
00:48:20,418 --> 00:48:21,717
- Come on! - No, it's nothing.

1524
00:48:21,718 --> 00:48:23,487
- You need to focus! - Why aren't you getting along?

1525
00:48:23,488 --> 00:48:24,527
Get yourself together!

1526
00:48:24,528 --> 00:48:25,656
May I continue, Kwang Soo?

1527
00:48:25,657 --> 00:48:27,127
- Yes, I'm sorry. - May I continue?

1528
00:48:27,128 --> 00:48:30,025
Then please get into teams of two.

1529
00:48:30,028 --> 00:48:31,866
- Should we choose with the spoons? - Let's do that.

1530
00:48:31,867 --> 00:48:33,897
- Yes, that's the best way. - The spoons will be good.

1531
00:48:33,898 --> 00:48:36,865
(Team Results)

1532
00:48:37,267 --> 00:48:39,828
Now, we will reveal it.

1533
00:48:40,108 --> 00:48:41,306
- You two can't see it. - Okay.

1534
00:48:41,307 --> 00:48:42,377
Only we can.

1535
00:48:42,378 --> 00:48:44,316
(The mystery item is revealed.)

1536
00:48:44,407 --> 00:48:48,089
(Which item will they have to describe without knowing?)

1537
00:48:49,048 --> 00:48:50,241
What will it be?

1538
00:48:50,787 --> 00:48:51,917
That's hard.

1539
00:48:51,918 --> 00:48:55,079
(Enema)

1540
00:48:55,718 --> 00:48:57,156
(This won't be easy!)

1541
00:48:57,157 --> 00:48:59,127
- That? - That's hard.

1542
00:48:59,187 --> 00:49:03,096
Well, everyone, this item is something I don't...

1543
00:49:03,097 --> 00:49:05,167
- usually bring to the show. - Yes.

1544
00:49:05,168 --> 00:49:07,567
- I finally brought it to you. - It's something...

1545
00:49:07,568 --> 00:49:09,936
- we held back on. - It's that very item!

1546
00:49:09,937 --> 00:49:10,989
Why did you hold it back?

1547
00:49:11,168 --> 00:49:12,866
Well, it's great for newlyweds!

1548
00:49:12,867 --> 00:49:14,107
(Well, it's great for newlyweds!)

1549
00:49:14,108 --> 00:49:15,433
- It's so amazing. - "Newlyweds"?

1550
00:49:15,608 --> 00:49:17,514
- Yes, newlyweds. - Did you use this then?

1551
00:49:17,747 --> 00:49:19,543
We always had this at our house when we were newlyweds.

1552
00:49:20,178 --> 00:49:21,346
- Seok Jin! - Really?

1553
00:49:21,347 --> 00:49:23,717
This will make you love each other.

1554
00:49:23,718 --> 00:49:25,860
- With this? - For example,

1555
00:49:26,718 --> 00:49:28,317
if you have a fight with your wife...

1556
00:49:28,318 --> 00:49:29,987
It can happen, there can be tension...

1557
00:49:29,988 --> 00:49:31,620
- during the early years. - He's right, though.

1558
00:49:31,727 --> 00:49:33,186
Whenever I saw this,

1559
00:49:33,727 --> 00:49:35,956
I couldn't help but smile.

1560
00:49:35,957 --> 00:49:37,027
- Really? - Why?

1561
00:49:37,028 --> 00:49:38,527
- It made me so happy. - You feel refreshed?

1562
00:49:38,528 --> 00:49:40,967
It's one of my three favorite things.

1563
00:49:40,968 --> 00:49:42,937
When was the last time you used it?

1564
00:49:43,437 --> 00:49:44,507
- This? - When did you use it?

1565
00:49:44,508 --> 00:49:45,806
I used it with my child.

1566
00:49:45,807 --> 00:49:46,976
- With your child? - I used it with my child.

1567
00:49:46,977 --> 00:49:48,936
- When's the best time to use it? - What?

1568
00:49:48,937 --> 00:49:51,223
- When's the best time? - My child used it in the morning.

1569
00:49:51,977 --> 00:49:53,246
He...

1570
00:49:53,247 --> 00:49:54,877
was bored.

1571
00:49:54,878 --> 00:49:57,417
He can overcome his puberty with this.

1572
00:49:57,418 --> 00:49:58,487
That's possible.

1573
00:49:58,488 --> 00:50:00,457
- It makes people happy. - Yes.

1574
00:50:00,588 --> 00:50:02,903
If you don't know this,

1575
00:50:02,957 --> 00:50:04,726
then you don't know the happiness of life.

1576
00:50:04,727 --> 00:50:05,826
- Yes. - That's right.

1577
00:50:05,827 --> 00:50:08,056
I would even survive a deserted island...

1578
00:50:08,057 --> 00:50:09,096
with just this.

1579
00:50:09,097 --> 00:50:12,127
(I would even survive a deserted island with just this!)

1580
00:50:12,128 --> 00:50:13,436
- What? - Just this.

1581
00:50:13,437 --> 00:50:15,167
- You only need this to survive? - To be honest,

1582
00:50:15,168 --> 00:50:16,967
- this is all I need to survive. - Okay.

1583
00:50:16,968 --> 00:50:18,206
I don't need anything else.

1584
00:50:18,207 --> 00:50:19,809
I think I could last for three years...

1585
00:50:20,407 --> 00:50:21,837
only eating stew made out of this.

1586
00:50:21,838 --> 00:50:23,447
- Stew? - Really?

1587
00:50:23,448 --> 00:50:24,576
Stew made out of this?

1588
00:50:24,577 --> 00:50:26,917
- I love stew so much. - Why would you make stew?

1589
00:50:26,918 --> 00:50:28,479
Are you sure you can eat this?

1590
00:50:29,318 --> 00:50:30,417
I don't think you can.

1591
00:50:30,418 --> 00:50:32,417
(I don't think you can.)

1592
00:50:32,418 --> 00:50:34,151
- Nothing's inedible in this world. - Could you recommend it?

1593
00:50:34,588 --> 00:50:36,628
How did you feel when you first used it?

1594
00:50:37,057 --> 00:50:38,312
- For me... - Yes?

1595
00:50:39,028 --> 00:50:40,558
- How did you feel? - Be honest.

1596
00:50:40,628 --> 00:50:43,004
- We don't need to hide it anymore. - Right.

1597
00:50:44,298 --> 00:50:46,165
- If I have a child in the future, - Yes?

1598
00:50:46,398 --> 00:50:49,536
(If a Kwang Soo Junior were to be born...)

1599
00:50:49,537 --> 00:50:52,167
(as the result of love in the far future...)

1600
00:50:52,168 --> 00:50:53,476
I'd like to name it...

1601
00:50:53,477 --> 00:50:54,966
(The child's name.)

1602
00:50:55,878 --> 00:50:58,377
I'm thinking about naming it...

1603
00:50:58,378 --> 00:50:59,377
(His child's name will be Lee Enema.)

1604
00:50:59,378 --> 00:51:00,540
after this, for real.

1605
00:51:01,577 --> 00:51:03,047
- This is too much. - No way.

1606
00:51:03,048 --> 00:51:04,386
(He explained his first impressions with a tragedy for his child.)

1607
00:51:04,387 --> 00:51:06,969
Could you strongly recommend it one last time?

1608
00:51:07,088 --> 00:51:10,556
To those of you who are lonely,

1609
00:51:10,628 --> 00:51:12,527
to those of you who had a nightmare,

1610
00:51:12,528 --> 00:51:15,618
- if you kiss this in the morning, - Yes.

1611
00:51:15,898 --> 00:51:17,127
you will be very happy.

1612
00:51:17,128 --> 00:51:20,697
Also, to married couples who don't have a great relationship,

1613
00:51:20,698 --> 00:51:22,096
- Please don't. - or...

1614
00:51:22,097 --> 00:51:23,096
- That's too... - Please...

1615
00:51:23,097 --> 00:51:25,167
Families who haven't been talking too much lately.

1616
00:51:25,168 --> 00:51:26,306
- Yes. - If you're feeling awkward,

1617
00:51:26,307 --> 00:51:28,144
- You really will have a lot to say. - Right.

1618
00:51:28,238 --> 00:51:30,906
- You can give this as a present, - A present?

1619
00:51:30,907 --> 00:51:32,777
the negative tensions will melt away like snow.

1620
00:51:32,778 --> 00:51:35,705
- That was a good pitch. - Okay.

1621
00:51:35,747 --> 00:51:37,420
We will end the presentation.

1622
00:51:37,887 --> 00:51:39,746
Please check your item.

1623
00:51:39,747 --> 00:51:42,556
(Enema)

1624
00:51:42,557 --> 00:51:44,427
Your child's name will be Lee Enema.

1625
00:51:44,428 --> 00:51:45,448
(Your child's name will be Lee Enema.)

1626
00:51:46,028 --> 00:51:48,476
- You kiss it in the morning? - Every morning.

1627
00:51:48,528 --> 00:51:51,197
"I would even survive a deserted island with just this."

1628
00:51:51,198 --> 00:51:52,527
- I gave you points for that. - Okay.

1629
00:51:52,528 --> 00:51:54,167
"We always had this when we were newlyweds."

1630
00:51:54,168 --> 00:51:55,831
- I gave you points for that. - Okay.

1631
00:51:56,097 --> 00:51:57,467
How about the name?

1632
00:51:57,468 --> 00:51:58,732
"I'd like to name it after this." Yes.

1633
00:51:58,937 --> 00:52:00,076
- You have to name it that. - Lee Enema.

1634
00:52:00,077 --> 00:52:01,406
(Lee Enema)

1635
00:52:01,407 --> 00:52:02,507
- Lee Enema. - Lee Enema.

1636
00:52:02,508 --> 00:52:04,650
I gave you points for that.

1637
00:52:04,778 --> 00:52:07,226
- Let's go. - Now should we give it a go?

1638
00:52:07,847 --> 00:52:09,047
Please change the item.

1639
00:52:09,048 --> 00:52:12,087
You get points if you're specific.

1640
00:52:12,088 --> 00:52:13,686
- You have to be detailed. - Here you go.

1641
00:52:13,687 --> 00:52:16,286
- All right. - 1, 2, 3!

1642
00:52:16,287 --> 00:52:17,286
(The mystery item is revealed.)

1643
00:52:17,287 --> 00:52:19,186
Ta-da! Surprise!

1644
00:52:19,187 --> 00:52:20,357
(They have to explain the item without knowing what it is.)

1645
00:52:20,358 --> 00:52:23,734
(What is the item they will have to sell?)

1646
00:52:23,997 --> 00:52:30,597
(Dog food)

1647
00:52:31,468 --> 00:52:33,206
(That won't be easy, either!)

1648
00:52:33,207 --> 00:52:34,906
If you don't know this...

1649
00:52:34,907 --> 00:52:38,038
- If you don't know this, - Yes.

1650
00:52:38,048 --> 00:52:39,806
- there's no point in living. - That's right.

1651
00:52:39,807 --> 00:52:42,470
You'll regret later if you have to miss this chance.

1652
00:52:42,648 --> 00:52:43,987
- I think... - Do you like this?

1653
00:52:43,988 --> 00:52:45,016
- What? - Do you like this?

1654
00:52:45,017 --> 00:52:46,171
I'm crazy for it.

1655
00:52:48,117 --> 00:52:50,087
(I'm crazy for dog food.)

1656
00:52:50,088 --> 00:52:51,127
(News Flash, Yu Jae Seok is crazy for dog food.)

1657
00:52:51,128 --> 00:52:52,383
- You're crazy for it? - I...

1658
00:52:52,457 --> 00:52:54,397
- If it weren't for the show, - Yes?

1659
00:52:54,398 --> 00:52:57,458
I would even go further than that.

1660
00:52:57,468 --> 00:52:58,866
I go nuts for it.

1661
00:52:58,867 --> 00:53:00,866
- When do you go nuts for it? - Sorry?

1662
00:53:00,867 --> 00:53:03,766
- Well, when I'm going to bed, - Going to bed?

1663
00:53:03,767 --> 00:53:05,436
my eyes get wide open because of this.

1664
00:53:05,437 --> 00:53:06,507
- Really? - Yes.

1665
00:53:06,508 --> 00:53:08,140
When did you first get to know this?

1666
00:53:08,238 --> 00:53:10,346
I guess it was when I was in elementary school.

1667
00:53:10,347 --> 00:53:11,607
- Really? - Since elementary school?

1668
00:53:11,608 --> 00:53:12,947
- Yes. - Since back then?

1669
00:53:12,948 --> 00:53:14,476
- It's been so long. - Yes.

1670
00:53:14,477 --> 00:53:17,578
For those of you who have cold hands and feet,

1671
00:53:18,218 --> 00:53:20,156
- this is good for you. - For cold hands and feet?

1672
00:53:20,157 --> 00:53:21,286
Yes, when they're cold.

1673
00:53:21,287 --> 00:53:25,556
Everyone, do you know why I'm so fertile?

1674
00:53:25,557 --> 00:53:27,843
(Do you know why I'm so fertile?)

1675
00:53:28,428 --> 00:53:29,726
It's because of that?

1676
00:53:29,727 --> 00:53:31,797
(His secret to fertility has finally been revealed.)

1677
00:53:31,798 --> 00:53:33,093
It's because of that?

1678
00:53:33,367 --> 00:53:34,366
It's because of that?

1679
00:53:34,367 --> 00:53:36,172
- That? - It's all thanks to this.

1680
00:53:36,298 --> 00:53:37,939
- That? - Sure.

1681
00:53:38,437 --> 00:53:40,306
- You had your second child, too. - We have a total...

1682
00:53:40,307 --> 00:53:42,377
- of five children. - Yes.

1683
00:53:42,378 --> 00:53:43,476
(They have a total of five children.)

1684
00:53:43,477 --> 00:53:44,877
- We have a total of five children. - That's so funny.

1685
00:53:44,878 --> 00:53:46,147
- That was your secret? - It's this.

1686
00:53:46,148 --> 00:53:47,217
That's so scary.

1687
00:53:47,218 --> 00:53:50,756
My wife and mother-in-law are always so busy hiding this.

1688
00:53:51,148 --> 00:53:52,487
That's how great this is.

1689
00:53:52,488 --> 00:53:53,610
That's how great this is.

1690
00:53:53,718 --> 00:53:55,930
- This is... - I'm always asking for this,

1691
00:53:56,017 --> 00:53:57,456
so they're always afraid.

1692
00:53:57,457 --> 00:54:00,527
This is a method...

1693
00:54:00,528 --> 00:54:03,927
- that isn't widely known yet. - It's a secret.

1694
00:54:03,928 --> 00:54:04,967
That's amazing.

1695
00:54:04,968 --> 00:54:07,078
It's been passed on for generation to generation in my family.

1696
00:54:07,267 --> 00:54:09,766
- My ancestors have used this, too. - That's right.

1697
00:54:09,767 --> 00:54:10,906
- Your ancestors? - Yes.

1698
00:54:10,907 --> 00:54:13,377
- Your ancestors, too? - Why didn't you let me in on this?

1699
00:54:13,378 --> 00:54:14,677
That's why you shouldn't hesitate now.

1700
00:54:14,678 --> 00:54:17,377
There's only a limited amount.

1701
00:54:17,378 --> 00:54:19,076
How was it when you first tasted it?

1702
00:54:19,077 --> 00:54:20,116
How should I put it?

1703
00:54:20,117 --> 00:54:22,626
It can be kind of bitter at first.

1704
00:54:22,778 --> 00:54:25,879
But there's a sweetness to it the more you chew.

1705
00:54:25,948 --> 00:54:27,886
- I kept telling you. - You really tasted it.

1706
00:54:27,887 --> 00:54:31,456
I won't sell you anything that I haven't tried.

1707
00:54:31,457 --> 00:54:34,297
What's the best way to eat it?

1708
00:54:34,298 --> 00:54:35,553
You can just shovel it down,

1709
00:54:35,798 --> 00:54:37,297
- Or mix it with water. - or mix it with water.

1710
00:54:37,298 --> 00:54:39,697
You can put it on rice or sprinkle it in your stew.

1711
00:54:39,698 --> 00:54:42,217
(You can put it on rice or sprinkle it in your stew.)

1712
00:54:42,267 --> 00:54:43,607
- Sprinkle it in your stew. - Yes.

1713
00:54:43,608 --> 00:54:45,337
- It tastes heavenly. - Sprinkle it in your stew.

1714
00:54:45,338 --> 00:54:47,177
- You can have it in any way. - You can make rice balls, too.

1715
00:54:47,178 --> 00:54:48,877
(Their sales have come to an end.)

1716
00:54:48,878 --> 00:54:51,428
- It all made sense, though. - It did.

1717
00:54:51,448 --> 00:54:53,147
- It was right. - Jae Seok is a true fan.

1718
00:54:53,148 --> 00:54:54,677
- Please check your item. - I'm a big fan.

1719
00:54:54,678 --> 00:54:55,800
It seemed so real.

1720
00:54:56,477 --> 00:54:58,150
You put it on rice...

1721
00:54:58,287 --> 00:54:59,587
and sprinkle it in your stew?

1722
00:54:59,588 --> 00:55:00,843
And in your gimbap?

1723
00:55:00,988 --> 00:55:02,757
- It's good. - It all made sense.

1724
00:55:02,758 --> 00:55:05,027
It was funny when you said your wife hid it...

1725
00:55:05,028 --> 00:55:06,087
because you were crazy for it.

1726
00:55:06,088 --> 00:55:07,965
You're unbelievable, Haha.

1727
00:55:08,097 --> 00:55:10,797
- This team got a lot of points. - Did we?

1728
00:55:10,798 --> 00:55:12,567
"The secret to being fertile is dog food."

1729
00:55:12,568 --> 00:55:13,697
- I said that. - He said that.

1730
00:55:13,698 --> 00:55:15,436
- Both of us. - "My wife and mother-in-law..."

1731
00:55:15,437 --> 00:55:17,036
"are always so busy hiding this."

1732
00:55:17,037 --> 00:55:18,167
"It can be kind of bitter at first,"

1733
00:55:18,168 --> 00:55:20,136
- "but there's a sweetness to it." - Right.

1734
00:55:20,137 --> 00:55:22,737
You can't put it like this unless you've really tried it.

1735
00:55:22,738 --> 00:55:24,135
- He's tried it. - I've tried it.

1736
00:55:24,207 --> 00:55:26,406
Why don't Ji Hyo and Jong Kook go next?

1737
00:55:26,407 --> 00:55:27,516
- Okay. - Sure.

1738
00:55:27,517 --> 00:55:28,616
It was dog food.

1739
00:55:28,617 --> 00:55:29,677
- It was so funny. - It made sense.

1740
00:55:29,678 --> 00:55:31,016
- I thought they saw the word. - It all made sense somehow.

1741
00:55:31,017 --> 00:55:32,516
Me, too. I thought they knew it.

1742
00:55:32,517 --> 00:55:33,537
We didn't know.

1743
00:55:33,687 --> 00:55:35,556
Jong Kook and Ji Hyo.

1744
00:55:35,557 --> 00:55:36,587
(Jong Kook and Ji Hyo's mystery item is revealed.)

1745
00:55:36,588 --> 00:55:39,956
(What is the item the ace team will have to sell?)

1746
00:55:39,957 --> 00:55:41,397
(Diaper)

1747
00:55:41,398 --> 00:55:42,449
This is...

1748
00:55:42,928 --> 00:55:44,091
It's a new item.

1749
00:55:47,497 --> 00:55:50,832
(That's a difficult one.)

1750
00:55:51,008 --> 00:55:52,306
What kind of product is this?

1751
00:55:52,307 --> 00:55:53,777
It's cool, isn't it?

1752
00:55:53,778 --> 00:55:56,277
Many people are concerned about their weight, right?

1753
00:55:56,278 --> 00:55:57,635
I use this a lot...

1754
00:55:57,847 --> 00:56:00,346
when I work out.

1755
00:56:00,347 --> 00:56:02,746
(I use this a lot when I work out.)

1756
00:56:02,747 --> 00:56:04,042
- Is that true? - Yes.

1757
00:56:04,218 --> 00:56:05,417
(Shocking news, "I put a diaper on when I'm exercising.")

1758
00:56:05,418 --> 00:56:07,357
I used this too when I was on a diet,

1759
00:56:07,358 --> 00:56:09,296
because he recommended it.

1760
00:56:09,588 --> 00:56:11,362
- Really? - Amazing!

1761
00:56:11,657 --> 00:56:14,483
It's good for people who want to gain muscle mass...

1762
00:56:14,698 --> 00:56:17,667
and also for those who want to lose weight.

1763
00:56:17,668 --> 00:56:20,167
- You will build a great body. - Really?

1764
00:56:20,168 --> 00:56:22,067
- You need this in the summer. - The results are great.

1765
00:56:22,068 --> 00:56:24,688
I'm sure there are downsides. What are they?

1766
00:56:24,807 --> 00:56:28,142
Well, if you stop in the middle of using this,

1767
00:56:28,807 --> 00:56:30,976
(Looking odd)

1768
00:56:30,977 --> 00:56:32,579
it may get difficult.

1769
00:56:32,907 --> 00:56:33,976
What was that?

1770
00:56:33,977 --> 00:56:35,753
If you stop in the middle of using this...

1771
00:56:36,418 --> 00:56:38,786
(Twisting her body)

1772
00:56:38,787 --> 00:56:41,686
(It may get difficult.)

1773
00:56:41,687 --> 00:56:43,357
I think she knows what it is!

1774
00:56:43,358 --> 00:56:44,627
What was that face?

1775
00:56:44,628 --> 00:56:46,769
She's explaining it with her face.

1776
00:56:47,128 --> 00:56:48,357
(If you stop using it,)

1777
00:56:48,358 --> 00:56:50,847
(it may get difficult.)

1778
00:56:51,497 --> 00:56:53,783
You could practically be a model for that product.

1779
00:56:53,798 --> 00:56:56,011
What do you think of men who use this?

1780
00:56:56,597 --> 00:56:57,806
They're sexy.

1781
00:56:57,807 --> 00:56:58,837
(Men who use this are sexy.)

1782
00:56:58,838 --> 00:57:00,817
- To whom would you recommend this? - Well...

1783
00:57:01,477 --> 00:57:03,375
- Who would look good in this? - Is there anyone?

1784
00:57:03,977 --> 00:57:05,232
Kwang Soo.

1785
00:57:05,577 --> 00:57:06,647
- Kwang Soo would look good. - Yes.

1786
00:57:06,648 --> 00:57:08,417
If Kwang Soo wears this,

1787
00:57:08,418 --> 00:57:09,616
(I would look good in a diaper?)

1788
00:57:09,617 --> 00:57:11,286
her girlfriend might get anxious.

1789
00:57:11,287 --> 00:57:12,614
- But this... - If he wears this?

1790
00:57:12,687 --> 00:57:14,357
- She'd get anxious? - Sure she would.

1791
00:57:14,358 --> 00:57:16,152
- His girlfriend would get anxious. - Of course.

1792
00:57:16,928 --> 00:57:18,987
She'd get anxious if he wears this?

1793
00:57:18,988 --> 00:57:21,496
- For Seok Jin, - Yes?

1794
00:57:21,497 --> 00:57:23,914
you can wear it on your head for parties.

1795
00:57:24,198 --> 00:57:25,397
- Wear it on his head? - Yes.

1796
00:57:25,398 --> 00:57:26,627
He can wear it on his head.

1797
00:57:26,628 --> 00:57:28,596
- On my head? - Yes.

1798
00:57:28,597 --> 00:57:30,766
- At parties? - You will stand out.

1799
00:57:30,767 --> 00:57:32,266
- You'll be popular. - They're right.

1800
00:57:32,267 --> 00:57:33,266
- Sure. - It all makes sense.

1801
00:57:33,267 --> 00:57:36,107
What do you think about men who wear this to parties?

1802
00:57:36,108 --> 00:57:38,277
I'm going to date that man.

1803
00:57:38,278 --> 00:57:40,007
(Okay! I'll wear it to parties.)

1804
00:57:40,008 --> 00:57:41,547
- That man? - That man.

1805
00:57:41,548 --> 00:57:43,791
- It's very neat of him. - Will you share it with him?

1806
00:57:44,488 --> 00:57:45,915
Share it?

1807
00:57:46,488 --> 00:57:47,817
- Sure. - Will you really share it?

1808
00:57:47,818 --> 00:57:49,717
- Of course. That's possible. - Of course.

1809
00:57:49,718 --> 00:57:52,236
- Sure, why not? - I'll help him put it on nicely.

1810
00:57:52,827 --> 00:57:53,950
You will?

1811
00:57:54,358 --> 00:57:55,496
(Ji Hyo doesn't hesitate to reveal her odd tastes.)

1812
00:57:55,497 --> 00:57:56,752
Are you serious?

1813
00:57:57,497 --> 00:57:58,527
(Jong Kook and Ji Hyo's sales come to an end.)

1814
00:57:58,528 --> 00:58:00,201
- I highly recommend it. - Ji Hyo...

1815
00:58:00,398 --> 00:58:01,737
- She's quite bold. - was very fierce.

1816
00:58:01,738 --> 00:58:02,737
She was.

1817
00:58:02,738 --> 00:58:04,866
- She must know what this is. - Yes.

1818
00:58:04,867 --> 00:58:07,607
- You two were on point. - What is it?

1819
00:58:07,608 --> 00:58:08,737
- You may look. - Go on.

1820
00:58:08,738 --> 00:58:09,837
You may look inside.

1821
00:58:09,838 --> 00:58:10,877
(It is time to check the mystery item.)

1822
00:58:10,878 --> 00:58:13,224
(They turn their faces away.)

1823
00:58:14,548 --> 00:58:16,317
- You use it when you work out. - Why do you use it?

1824
00:58:16,318 --> 00:58:19,547
I use it because working out can be hard.

1825
00:58:19,548 --> 00:58:21,148
- You wear it and work out. - That's right.

1826
00:58:21,818 --> 00:58:23,456
- I might wet my pants. - Ji Hyo, you have to date...

1827
00:58:23,457 --> 00:58:25,027
a man in a diaper if you meet him at a party.

1828
00:58:25,028 --> 00:58:27,527
- This team scored many points. - Really?

1829
00:58:27,528 --> 00:58:30,366
Using it for workouts, using it after Jong Kook's recommendation...

1830
00:58:30,367 --> 00:58:31,996
Those comments scored a point.

1831
00:58:31,997 --> 00:58:35,200
She also made a sexy face and said it can be hard to stop using it.

1832
00:58:35,338 --> 00:58:37,036
That's right. That's right.

1833
00:58:37,037 --> 00:58:38,766
She said a man who wears this is sexy.

1834
00:58:38,767 --> 00:58:39,766
Kwang Soo looks good in it,

1835
00:58:39,767 --> 00:58:41,572
but his girlfriend becomes anxious when he wears it.

1836
00:58:41,707 --> 00:58:43,337
Of course she would become anxious.

1837
00:58:43,338 --> 00:58:44,906
- She would become anxious. - "Isn't he too young for this?"

1838
00:58:44,907 --> 00:58:46,177
- She would become anxious. - It's understandable.

1839
00:58:46,178 --> 00:58:48,817
Next come Se Chan and So Min.

1840
00:58:48,818 --> 00:58:51,266
- Love your colleagues and country. - Love your colleagues and country.

1841
00:58:52,448 --> 00:58:53,987
- Let's see the item. - I will open it.

1842
00:58:53,988 --> 00:58:55,317
In 1, 2, 3.

1843
00:58:55,318 --> 00:58:56,357
(The mystery item is revealed.)

1844
00:58:56,358 --> 00:58:59,987
(Which item will the youngest members describe?)

1845
00:58:59,988 --> 00:59:05,467
(A pair of handcuffs)

1846
00:59:05,468 --> 00:59:06,567
(It's an intense item.)

1847
00:59:06,568 --> 00:59:09,118
- It's expensive. - All right.

1848
00:59:09,238 --> 00:59:12,501
When you feel lonely and want to flirt with someone,

1849
00:59:12,508 --> 00:59:14,206
- please use this item. - When you are struggling,

1850
00:59:14,207 --> 00:59:15,777
- use this item. - Yes.

1851
00:59:15,778 --> 00:59:17,906
When should we use this item in a relationship?

1852
00:59:17,907 --> 00:59:20,246
I usually use it for the first meeting...

1853
00:59:20,247 --> 00:59:21,317
or...

1854
00:59:21,318 --> 00:59:22,917
- The first meeting? - Yes.

1855
00:59:22,918 --> 00:59:24,786
- I use it before the first meeting. - That's right.

1856
00:59:24,787 --> 00:59:27,056
- Before the first meeting? - Yes. When I do that,

1857
00:59:27,057 --> 00:59:28,917
- you know, women... - Do women love it?

1858
00:59:28,918 --> 00:59:30,016
Women love it.

1859
00:59:30,017 --> 00:59:31,863
"Gosh, did you use this?"

1860
00:59:32,428 --> 00:59:34,996
I always use this.

1861
00:59:34,997 --> 00:59:36,027
- Really? - Me, too.

1862
00:59:36,028 --> 00:59:37,797
- In a relationship? - I would die without it.

1863
00:59:37,798 --> 00:59:38,897
You always use it in a relationship.

1864
00:59:38,898 --> 00:59:40,367
When did you use it for the first time?

1865
00:59:40,367 --> 00:59:42,132
I used it for the 1st time in 3rd grade.

1866
00:59:42,597 --> 00:59:44,607
I used it for the 1st time in 3rd grade.

1867
00:59:44,608 --> 00:59:46,107
- Really? That's early. - Yes.

1868
00:59:46,108 --> 00:59:47,436
When did you start using it?

1869
00:59:47,437 --> 00:59:49,417
I started using it as an adult at the age of 20.

1870
00:59:49,508 --> 00:59:50,935
She is serious.

1871
00:59:50,977 --> 00:59:52,507
She is serious.

1872
00:59:52,508 --> 00:59:54,415
- She is serious. - She is serious.

1873
00:59:54,617 --> 00:59:56,987
- So Min is serious. - What is it?

1874
00:59:56,988 --> 00:59:58,717
I used it for the 1st time in 3rd grade.

1875
00:59:58,718 --> 00:59:59,717
- In third grade? - Yes.

1876
00:59:59,718 --> 01:00:02,357
- Some people are scared of it. - Yes.

1877
01:00:02,358 --> 01:00:04,427
What would you like to say to them?

1878
01:00:04,428 --> 01:00:06,326
- People are scared of it? - Some people are scared of it.

1879
01:00:06,327 --> 01:00:08,427
They should cover their eyes and use it.

1880
01:00:08,428 --> 01:00:10,427
- They should cover their eyes? - They should turn off the light.

1881
01:00:10,428 --> 01:00:12,028
- They should turn off the light? - They should turn off the light?

1882
01:00:12,097 --> 01:00:13,697
You saw the item, right?

1883
01:00:13,698 --> 01:00:16,096
(She must be serious.)

1884
01:00:16,097 --> 01:00:17,806
- You saw the item, right? - No!

1885
01:00:17,807 --> 01:00:20,316
- You saw the item, right? - Turn off the light.

1886
01:00:20,678 --> 01:00:23,177
When you turn off the light, it feels like a special event.

1887
01:00:23,178 --> 01:00:25,277
When you turn off the light, it feels like a special event.

1888
01:00:25,278 --> 01:00:27,817
(He says anything that comes to mind.)

1889
01:00:27,818 --> 01:00:29,817
- This can't air. - It feels like a special event.

1890
01:00:29,818 --> 01:00:31,616
What? Why? What is the item?

1891
01:00:31,617 --> 01:00:33,717
- What is the item? - What is the item?

1892
01:00:33,718 --> 01:00:35,056
I don't know what it is.

1893
01:00:35,057 --> 01:00:36,995
- I don't know what it is. - You saw it, right?

1894
01:00:37,088 --> 01:00:38,826
Let's check the item and change it.

1895
01:00:38,827 --> 01:00:40,456
- What is the item? - It's a pair of handcuffs.

1896
01:00:40,457 --> 01:00:41,927
(Startled)

1897
01:00:41,928 --> 01:00:44,266
I told you.

1898
01:00:44,267 --> 01:00:45,266
(Please forget everything I said.)

1899
01:00:45,267 --> 01:00:46,826
- This is insane. - There is no hope for So Min.

1900
01:00:46,827 --> 01:00:49,337
- Seriously. - There is no hope for So Min.

1901
01:00:49,338 --> 01:00:51,906
I really didn't know.

1902
01:00:51,907 --> 01:00:54,998
- There is no hope for So Min. - I really didn't know.

1903
01:00:57,247 --> 01:00:58,976
How did you get that kind of an item?

1904
01:00:58,977 --> 01:01:00,277
- We got a pair of handcuffs. - Seriously.

1905
01:01:00,278 --> 01:01:01,317
- I will reveal the item. - Okay.

1906
01:01:01,318 --> 01:01:02,541
In 1, 2, 3.

1907
01:01:03,678 --> 01:01:08,516
(What will be the new item for the youngest members?)

1908
01:01:08,517 --> 01:01:09,516
All right.

1909
01:01:09,517 --> 01:01:11,568
(Princess doll)

1910
01:01:11,692 --> 01:01:15,092
<font color="#fcc89b">[VIU Ver] SBS E456 Running Man</font>

<font color="#ff5fa2">-♥ Ruo Xi ♥-</font>

1911
01:01:15,198 --> 01:01:18,635
We will sell an item men and women of all ages can enjoy.

1912
01:01:19,327 --> 01:01:21,737
Isn't it nice? You should use it, Jong Kook.

1913
01:01:21,738 --> 01:01:22,797
I wouldn't say...

1914
01:01:22,798 --> 01:01:23,806
- it suits me. - Use it after a workout.

1915
01:01:23,807 --> 01:01:26,725
If Jong Kook buys this, he will get married.

1916
01:01:27,437 --> 01:01:29,306
- Should I carry it around? - Yes.

1917
01:01:29,307 --> 01:01:31,076
- If I carry it around... - It will be like a good luck charm.

1918
01:01:31,077 --> 01:01:33,406
It does suit Jong Kook...

1919
01:01:33,407 --> 01:01:35,076
- a bit. - It does suit him.

1920
01:01:35,077 --> 01:01:37,417
Why don't you tell us...

1921
01:01:37,418 --> 01:01:39,317
when each of us should use it?

1922
01:01:39,318 --> 01:01:41,217
In which situation should we use it?

1923
01:01:41,218 --> 01:01:43,317
- Kwang Soo should use it... - He should use it when he is drunk.

1924
01:01:43,318 --> 01:01:44,927
He should use it when he is drunk.

1925
01:01:44,928 --> 01:01:46,527
It will be nice.

1926
01:01:46,528 --> 01:01:48,326
- It suits him very well. - It really does.

1927
01:01:48,327 --> 01:01:49,996
That makes sense.

1928
01:01:49,997 --> 01:01:51,151
When should I use it?

1929
01:01:51,568 --> 01:01:52,897
Use it when you are lonely at night.

1930
01:01:52,898 --> 01:01:57,079
(Jae Seok should use it when he is lonely at night.)

1931
01:01:57,267 --> 01:01:58,306
You saw the item, right?

1932
01:01:58,307 --> 01:01:59,866
- Don't be like that. - I didn't see it.

1933
01:01:59,867 --> 01:02:01,177
- For goodness' sake. - I am serious.

1934
01:02:01,178 --> 01:02:02,206
It's true!

1935
01:02:02,207 --> 01:02:03,706
I didn't see it.

1936
01:02:03,707 --> 01:02:05,277
What are you playing at?

1937
01:02:05,278 --> 01:02:06,277
I am not...

1938
01:02:06,278 --> 01:02:08,217
Jae Seok looks like he got caught.

1939
01:02:08,218 --> 01:02:09,417
What are you playing at?

1940
01:02:09,418 --> 01:02:11,693
- His face turned red. - Are you crazy?

1941
01:02:11,718 --> 01:02:13,655
- How about Haha? - When he wants the fourth child.

1942
01:02:14,287 --> 01:02:16,286
He should use it when he wants the fourth child.

1943
01:02:16,287 --> 01:02:17,826
You must know something.

1944
01:02:17,827 --> 01:02:19,326
- Seriously. - How about Ji Hyo?

1945
01:02:19,327 --> 01:02:20,582
Ji Hyo should use it soon.

1946
01:02:20,727 --> 01:02:21,726
- Use it before you meet someone. - Soon.

1947
01:02:21,727 --> 01:02:24,627
- Use it soon. - Use it before you meet a crush.

1948
01:02:24,628 --> 01:02:25,897
- Then sparks will fly. - Then you will date him.

1949
01:02:25,898 --> 01:02:27,197
You will date him right away.

1950
01:02:27,198 --> 01:02:30,507
Before you go to bed, set it on fire and burn it.

1951
01:02:30,508 --> 01:02:34,107
(So Min's recommended use of the princess doll)

1952
01:02:34,108 --> 01:02:35,406
(Shocked)

1953
01:02:35,407 --> 01:02:37,406
- Then you will have... - It's so scary!

1954
01:02:37,407 --> 01:02:38,877
It's so scary.

1955
01:02:38,878 --> 01:02:40,246
- Go on. - It's a good use.

1956
01:02:40,247 --> 01:02:42,917
If you set it on fire and burn it before you go to bed,

1957
01:02:42,918 --> 01:02:45,186
- you will have a good dream. - It's so scary.

1958
01:02:45,187 --> 01:02:47,706
- Use a torch, not a lighter. - Burn it up.

1959
01:02:47,918 --> 01:02:49,217
- A torch? - That's right.

1960
01:02:49,218 --> 01:02:51,527
- A torch? - Then it will burn better.

1961
01:02:51,528 --> 01:02:53,730
When do you use it?

1962
01:02:54,057 --> 01:02:56,826
To be honest, I use it often at night.

1963
01:02:56,827 --> 01:02:58,197
- Why? - Why?

1964
01:02:58,198 --> 01:03:00,067
I get lonely at night.

1965
01:03:00,068 --> 01:03:01,237
(He is sentimental and crazy.)

1966
01:03:01,238 --> 01:03:02,536
- I get lonely at night. - My goodness.

1967
01:03:02,537 --> 01:03:04,866
- I use it on a trip. - You use it on a trip.

1968
01:03:04,867 --> 01:03:07,536
I use it when the scenery is nice.

1969
01:03:07,537 --> 01:03:10,136
- Then I feel... - I recommend it.

1970
01:03:10,137 --> 01:03:12,698
- All right. Check the item. - Check the item.

1971
01:03:12,807 --> 01:03:14,960
- Let's see it. - What is it?

1972
01:03:15,617 --> 01:03:17,246
What did I say?

1973
01:03:17,247 --> 01:03:18,339
(Incredulous)

1974
01:03:18,617 --> 01:03:20,320
(It shouldn't be burned.)

1975
01:03:20,347 --> 01:03:23,016
This team won points for comments about burning the item...

1976
01:03:23,017 --> 01:03:25,127
- for a good dream. - It was really scary.

1977
01:03:25,128 --> 01:03:27,056
- It was really scary. - Seriously.

1978
01:03:27,057 --> 01:03:29,097
They also won points for using it for a lonely night.

1979
01:03:29,097 --> 01:03:31,985
On the first place is...

1980
01:03:32,168 --> 01:03:33,197
Team Jong Kook and Ji Hyo.

1981
01:03:33,198 --> 01:03:34,797
- That's right. - They deserve it.

1982
01:03:34,798 --> 01:03:37,036
On the second place is Team Jae Seok and Haha.

1983
01:03:37,037 --> 01:03:39,109
(2nd place, Team Jae Seok and Haha)

1984
01:03:39,207 --> 01:03:41,277
- I guess we came in last. - That's impossible.

1985
01:03:41,278 --> 01:03:44,408
You came in last. On the third place is Team Seok Jin and Kwang Soo.

1986
01:03:44,707 --> 01:03:46,246
- Thank goodness. - The members of the winning team...

1987
01:03:46,247 --> 01:03:48,516
can either take someone's Ginseng Badges...

1988
01:03:48,517 --> 01:03:49,976
or give away your Venomous Snake Badges.

1989
01:03:49,977 --> 01:03:51,721
When the two of them team up...

1990
01:03:51,818 --> 01:03:53,417
- They are invincible. - Seriously.

1991
01:03:53,418 --> 01:03:56,317
You have a Venomous Snake Badge. Let's see who doesn't have it.

1992
01:03:56,318 --> 01:03:58,062
- Give one to Seok Jin. - What?

1993
01:03:58,187 --> 01:03:59,527
- Seok Jin doesn't have one. - No, he doesn't.

1994
01:03:59,528 --> 01:04:00,726
- He doesn't have one. - You are right.

1995
01:04:00,727 --> 01:04:02,627
At this rate, he will be an English gentleman.

1996
01:04:02,628 --> 01:04:04,726
- Seriously. - King of consideration, my foot.

1997
01:04:04,727 --> 01:04:06,027
- You are right. - You must stop him.

1998
01:04:06,028 --> 01:04:07,874
I will give you a Venomous Snake Badge.

1999
01:04:08,298 --> 01:04:10,436
For goodness' sake.

2000
01:04:10,437 --> 01:04:12,607
Okay. I hold grudges.

2001
01:04:12,608 --> 01:04:14,923
- To whom will you give the badge? - Seok Jin.

2002
01:04:15,678 --> 01:04:17,507
- Good job. - Don't do that.

2003
01:04:17,508 --> 01:04:19,607
I will give it to Seok Jin.

2004
01:04:19,608 --> 01:04:22,447
He picks on me so much.

2005
01:04:22,448 --> 01:04:24,917
- That's right. - From the team that placed second,

2006
01:04:24,918 --> 01:04:27,641
- only one member has a chance. - I'll give a Venomous Snake Badge.

2007
01:04:28,057 --> 01:04:29,116
Jae Seok has too many.

2008
01:04:29,117 --> 01:04:30,516
That's right., I have too many Venomous Snake Badges.

2009
01:04:30,517 --> 01:04:33,037
That's right. Haha has a lot of Ginseng Badges.

2010
01:04:33,187 --> 01:04:35,156
- How about Kwang Soo? - I got two just now.

2011
01:04:35,157 --> 01:04:37,297
He doesn't have many.

2012
01:04:37,298 --> 01:04:38,828
He doesn't have many Venomous Snake Badges.

2013
01:04:38,997 --> 01:04:40,067
Hold on.

2014
01:04:40,068 --> 01:04:41,974
I will be getting a Venomous Snake Badge.

2015
01:04:42,137 --> 01:04:43,297
- What? - He doesn't have many.

2016
01:04:43,298 --> 01:04:44,695
Why does he have such a few Venomous Snake Badges?

2017
01:04:44,807 --> 01:04:46,436
Another hour has passed.

2018
01:04:46,437 --> 01:04:48,507
- What? - For goodness' sake!

2019
01:04:48,508 --> 01:04:51,277
(It's past the time again.)

2020
01:04:51,278 --> 01:04:54,147
(Kwang Soo spent 2 hours without transferring the bomb.)

2021
01:04:54,148 --> 01:04:56,877
The Bomb Sticker hasn't been transferred.

2022
01:04:56,878 --> 01:04:58,347
For goodness' sake.

2023
01:04:58,718 --> 01:05:01,675
Did you plant it in my body?

2024
01:05:02,187 --> 01:05:04,126
(Kwang Soo, look carefully.)

2025
01:05:04,187 --> 01:05:06,357
I will give one to So Min.

2026
01:05:06,358 --> 01:05:08,056
- Me? - Okay.

2027
01:05:08,057 --> 01:05:09,056
(Jae Seok gives So Min a Venomous Snake Badge.)

2028
01:05:09,057 --> 01:05:12,230
(Mystery Seller ends without finding Kwang Soo's bomb.)

2029
01:05:13,198 --> 01:05:15,967
- My goodness. - Everything looks delicious.

2030
01:05:15,968 --> 01:05:17,670
Everything looks delicious.

2031
01:05:17,767 --> 01:05:19,607
This is the best meal.

2032
01:05:19,608 --> 01:05:21,546
- Everything looks delicious. - Gosh, this is...

2033
01:05:21,778 --> 01:05:23,470
(The 1st and 2nd places are happy. The 3rd and 4th places are envious.)

2034
01:05:23,907 --> 01:05:25,906
Gosh, he is slurping the noodles.

2035
01:05:25,907 --> 01:05:27,817
- My goodness. - He is slurping the noodles.

2036
01:05:27,818 --> 01:05:28,838
I will eat jeonbyeong.

2037
01:05:30,247 --> 01:05:32,417
Let's eat cleanly.

2038
01:05:32,418 --> 01:05:34,317
- That's right. - Give us some food.

2039
01:05:34,318 --> 01:05:35,817
Why don't you share the noodles?

2040
01:05:35,818 --> 01:05:37,156
I don't think I can do that.

2041
01:05:37,157 --> 01:05:38,686
I will make a tempting offer.

2042
01:05:38,687 --> 01:05:41,527
- What is it? - I will get a Venomous Snake Badge.

2043
01:05:41,528 --> 01:05:42,697
- Really? - Yes.

2044
01:05:42,698 --> 01:05:44,996
- Venomous Snake Badge? - I swear upon it.

2045
01:05:44,997 --> 01:05:48,067
Se Chan, I will give you a bite of makguksu...

2046
01:05:48,068 --> 01:05:49,697
and a dumpling. Will you take my badge?

2047
01:05:49,698 --> 01:05:50,806
Of course.

2048
01:05:50,807 --> 01:05:52,237
One Venomous Snake Badge won't make a difference.

2049
01:05:52,238 --> 01:05:53,258
Okay.

2050
01:05:55,137 --> 01:05:56,677
I will give you jeonbyeong, too.

2051
01:05:56,678 --> 01:05:57,806
Thank you.

2052
01:05:57,807 --> 01:05:59,306
(He gets a Venomous Snake Badge for delicious lunch.)

2053
01:05:59,307 --> 01:06:01,076
You can't give it back to me.

2054
01:06:01,077 --> 01:06:02,246
Don't worry, Ji Hyo.

2055
01:06:02,247 --> 01:06:03,441
Did you find the bomb?

2056
01:06:04,318 --> 01:06:05,447
No.

2057
01:06:05,448 --> 01:06:06,468
(It's been over 2 hours.)

2058
01:06:06,918 --> 01:06:08,141
Search inside your ears.

2059
01:06:09,617 --> 01:06:12,208
- Solar plexus. - Under your tongue.

2060
01:06:13,187 --> 01:06:14,527
(It's not inside my ears.)

2061
01:06:14,528 --> 01:06:15,826
Look at the top of your head.

2062
01:06:15,827 --> 01:06:17,527
I looked everywhere.

2063
01:06:17,528 --> 01:06:19,726
I will give you a Ginseng Badge.

2064
01:06:19,727 --> 01:06:20,860
Okay.

2065
01:06:20,937 --> 01:06:22,697
- Take it. - Where are you going?

2066
01:06:22,698 --> 01:06:24,337
- The restroom. - Where are you going?

2067
01:06:24,338 --> 01:06:25,561
The restroom.

2068
01:06:26,537 --> 01:06:28,806
(Instead of going to the restroom,)

2069
01:06:28,807 --> 01:06:32,107
(Kwang Soo looks at his shoes.)

2070
01:06:32,108 --> 01:06:34,495
- Okay. Ginseng Badge. - Okay.

2071
01:06:34,878 --> 01:06:36,776
(At that moment,)

2072
01:06:36,777 --> 01:06:38,757
(he finds the Bomb Sticker.)

2073
01:06:39,918 --> 01:06:42,202
(This is why he couldn't find it on his body.)

2074
01:06:42,588 --> 01:06:44,771
(Now, the Bomb Sticker is in Kwang Soo's hand.)

2075
01:06:45,558 --> 01:06:47,057
(Now that I have the Bomb Sticker,)

2076
01:06:47,058 --> 01:06:49,853
(everyone should be nervous.)

2077
01:06:50,298 --> 01:06:53,388
(Kwang Soo will begin to transfer the bomb.)

2078
01:06:54,067 --> 01:06:56,396
(Not too long after he found the bomb,)

2079
01:06:56,397 --> 01:06:58,580
(Kwang Soo gets up.)

2080
01:06:59,407 --> 01:07:02,977
(He comes back and sends a text message.)

2081
01:07:02,978 --> 01:07:04,706
(I transferred the Bomb Sticker.)

2082
01:07:04,707 --> 01:07:07,328
(Did he already transfer the Bomb Sticker?)

2083
01:07:08,077 --> 01:07:11,760
(On whom did he put the Bomb Sticker?)

2084
01:07:12,418 --> 01:07:13,717
(With only Kwang Soo knowing who has the Bomb Sticker,)

2085
01:07:13,718 --> 01:07:15,917
(they move to the location of the next mission.)

2086
01:07:15,918 --> 01:07:19,048
Okay. We have time.

2087
01:07:19,287 --> 01:07:21,326
(Why is he whistling?)

2088
01:07:21,327 --> 01:07:25,927
- Kwang Soo is whistling. - This is driving me crazy.

2089
01:07:25,928 --> 01:07:27,536
(It's proof he doesn't have the Bomb Sticker.)

2090
01:07:27,537 --> 01:07:30,396
- Don't make it so obvious. - Everyone does that.

2091
01:07:30,397 --> 01:07:34,106
It's similar to how you burp after drinking a soft drink.

2092
01:07:34,107 --> 01:07:35,507
It can't be helped.

2093
01:07:35,508 --> 01:07:38,159
- Let's check the shoes first. - Shoes.

2094
01:07:38,447 --> 01:07:41,507
We should check the insoles, too.

2095
01:07:41,718 --> 01:07:43,276
- Where is it? - There is no way...

2096
01:07:43,277 --> 01:07:44,917
I put it on your armpit.

2097
01:07:44,918 --> 01:07:46,958
(There is no way I put it on your armpit.)

2098
01:07:47,957 --> 01:07:49,314
You never know.

2099
01:07:49,457 --> 01:07:52,957
The members keep checking their bodies.

2100
01:07:53,628 --> 01:07:54,896
- Kwang Soo. - Yes?

2101
01:07:54,897 --> 01:07:56,427
I will give you 50 cents. Tell me who has it now.

2102
01:07:56,428 --> 01:07:58,066
I don't want your lousy 50 cents!

2103
01:07:58,067 --> 01:08:00,679
(He gets angry.)

2104
01:08:01,338 --> 01:08:03,066
Where did you get those 50 cents?

2105
01:08:03,067 --> 01:08:05,658
Gosh, I guess the price rose.

2106
01:08:05,668 --> 01:08:07,977
Here. I will add 10 cents. It's tempting, right?

2107
01:08:07,978 --> 01:08:09,307
Where are these coins coming from?

2108
01:08:09,308 --> 01:08:11,143
He seems like a baby octopus sometimes.

2109
01:08:11,678 --> 01:08:12,746
The way he behaves?

2110
01:08:12,747 --> 01:08:14,207
He seems like a baby octopus sometimes.

2111
01:08:15,048 --> 01:08:16,877
What? "Baby octopus"?

2112
01:08:16,878 --> 01:08:18,717
Is something wrong with his mentality?

2113
01:08:18,718 --> 01:08:19,738
"Baby octopus"?

2114
01:08:19,787 --> 01:08:22,307
- Why? - He acts like a baby octopus.

2115
01:08:22,317 --> 01:08:23,616
I'm not sure,

2116
01:08:23,617 --> 01:08:25,188
but he acts like a baby octopus sometimes.

2117
01:08:26,457 --> 01:08:27,996
On whom did Kwang Soo put the sticker?

2118
01:08:27,997 --> 01:08:29,731
(On whom did Kwang Soo put the sticker?)

2119
01:08:30,027 --> 01:08:31,526
(No one knows where the Bomb Sticker is.)

2120
01:08:31,527 --> 01:08:34,337
- This is your last mission. - Good.

2121
01:08:34,338 --> 01:08:36,097
After the last mission...

2122
01:08:36,098 --> 01:08:37,260
Will it be decided?

2123
01:08:37,367 --> 01:08:38,969
When I make the final announcement,

2124
01:08:39,067 --> 01:08:40,736
the time will be over.

2125
01:08:40,737 --> 01:08:41,837
(If you have a bomb, Ginseng Badges turn into Venomous Snake Badges.)

2126
01:08:41,838 --> 01:08:42,837
All right.

2127
01:08:42,838 --> 01:08:45,908
- The time limit has passed again. - Okay.

2128
01:08:46,207 --> 01:08:47,377
The Bomb Sticker has been...

2129
01:08:47,378 --> 01:08:48,746
(Kwang Soo had the bomb.)

2130
01:08:48,747 --> 01:08:50,377
transferred to someone else.

2131
01:08:50,378 --> 01:08:53,071
(The Bomb Sticker has been transferred to someone else.)

2132
01:08:53,388 --> 01:08:54,986
(There was a reason why he whistled.)

2133
01:08:54,987 --> 01:08:56,650
Now I see why he whistled.

2134
01:08:57,088 --> 01:08:58,210
I'm jealous of Kwang Soo.

2135
01:08:58,987 --> 01:09:00,620
To the person who has it,

2136
01:09:00,857 --> 01:09:03,407
- Will you text us? - I'll send a text message.

2137
01:09:04,027 --> 01:09:05,119
We're watching our phones.

2138
01:09:06,397 --> 01:09:08,597
(To whom did Kwang Soo transfer the bomb?)

2139
01:09:08,598 --> 01:09:09,667
I sent it.

2140
01:09:09,668 --> 01:09:11,064
(The message is sent.)

2141
01:09:11,808 --> 01:09:13,937
(Which member has the bomb?)

2142
01:09:13,938 --> 01:09:15,713
(Smirking)

2143
01:09:16,338 --> 01:09:18,622
(She can't hide that she's perplexed.)

2144
01:09:19,647 --> 01:09:21,209
Only one person laughed.

2145
01:09:21,848 --> 01:09:23,246
- Goodness. - Gosh.

2146
01:09:23,247 --> 01:09:24,880
- It must not be me. - It's not me.

2147
01:09:24,987 --> 01:09:27,232
The person who has the bomb...

2148
01:09:27,418 --> 01:09:29,656
must do something with it before the mission is over.

2149
01:09:29,657 --> 01:09:31,627
If you get caught, you get another Venomous Snake Badge.

2150
01:09:31,628 --> 01:09:33,087
- Yes. - If you get caught transferring.

2151
01:09:33,388 --> 01:09:34,417
Excuse me.

2152
01:09:34,628 --> 01:09:36,974
- I'm going to take a shower. - Now?

2153
01:09:37,397 --> 01:09:39,097
(A shower all of a sudden?)

2154
01:09:39,098 --> 01:09:40,251
I know.

2155
01:09:40,367 --> 01:09:41,459
Kwang Soo.

2156
01:09:41,938 --> 01:09:43,090
Where did you hide it?

2157
01:09:44,567 --> 01:09:45,807
No, no!

2158
01:09:45,808 --> 01:09:48,021
(He's really flustered.)

2159
01:09:48,308 --> 01:09:50,419
Are you out of your mind?

2160
01:09:51,008 --> 01:09:52,606
When did I?

2161
01:09:52,607 --> 01:09:53,877
- I mean... - What are you doing?

2162
01:09:53,878 --> 01:09:54,877
"When did I?"

2163
01:09:54,878 --> 01:09:55,977
Where did you hide it?

2164
01:09:55,978 --> 01:09:57,917
(I can't find it anywhere.)

2165
01:09:57,918 --> 01:09:59,550
Their acting is...

2166
01:09:59,647 --> 01:10:01,717
too extreme.

2167
01:10:01,718 --> 01:10:03,012
- You can't find it. - It's too extreme.

2168
01:10:03,018 --> 01:10:04,139
You can't find it.

2169
01:10:05,027 --> 01:10:06,227
(Where could it be?)

2170
01:10:06,228 --> 01:10:07,757
For Knowing Your Place Race,

2171
01:10:07,758 --> 01:10:09,257
here's the last mission.

2172
01:10:09,258 --> 01:10:11,326
It's Sit or Stand Race of Wits.

2173
01:10:11,327 --> 01:10:12,520
It's Race of Wits.

2174
01:10:13,798 --> 01:10:15,124
It's Jae Seok's game.

2175
01:10:15,168 --> 01:10:16,496
I love Race of Wits.

2176
01:10:16,497 --> 01:10:18,007
At the same time,

2177
01:10:18,008 --> 01:10:19,904
members decide whether to sit or stand.

2178
01:10:20,067 --> 01:10:21,977
The minority of members wins.

2179
01:10:21,978 --> 01:10:23,058
(The minority of members wins.)

2180
01:10:23,508 --> 01:10:24,776
(It's very simple.)

2181
01:10:24,777 --> 01:10:25,776
Winning members...

2182
01:10:25,777 --> 01:10:28,576
can take a Ginseng Badge from another member.

2183
01:10:28,577 --> 01:10:29,776
Or they can give one Venomous Snake Badge.

2184
01:10:29,777 --> 01:10:31,757
You can turn the tables here.

2185
01:10:31,848 --> 01:10:33,551
There will be a twist.

2186
01:10:33,588 --> 01:10:35,757
If all members sit or stand, or if it's 4 to 4,

2187
01:10:35,758 --> 01:10:37,156
there won't be any badge exchange.

2188
01:10:37,157 --> 01:10:38,586
(If it's 4 to 4, there's no badge exchange.)

2189
01:10:38,688 --> 01:10:40,687
- It will be decided here. - It will be decided.

2190
01:10:40,688 --> 01:10:43,496
- It's confusing. - We have many badges.

2191
01:10:43,497 --> 01:10:44,997
Focus, So Min.

2192
01:10:45,067 --> 01:10:47,196
(Focus, So Min.)

2193
01:10:47,197 --> 01:10:48,463
I worked hard to protect.

2194
01:10:48,938 --> 01:10:50,222
So Min is very busy.

2195
01:10:50,397 --> 01:10:51,807
She can't focus.

2196
01:10:51,808 --> 01:10:53,745
- She can't focus on this game. - We'll start.

2197
01:10:54,207 --> 01:10:55,276
Choose whether to sit or stand.

2198
01:10:55,277 --> 01:10:57,654
- Everyone chooses at the same time. - Okay.

2199
01:10:57,777 --> 01:10:59,146
If you stand up late, you're out.

2200
01:10:59,147 --> 01:11:00,406
That's right. Here we go.

2201
01:11:00,407 --> 01:11:01,540
One.

2202
01:11:01,817 --> 01:11:03,146
- Two. - I'll stand up.

2203
01:11:03,147 --> 01:11:04,246
Me too.

2204
01:11:04,247 --> 01:11:05,816
(If you win, you can take a Ginseng Badge...)

2205
01:11:05,817 --> 01:11:07,246
(or give a Venomous Snake Badge.)

2206
01:11:07,348 --> 01:11:08,356
Three.

2207
01:11:08,357 --> 01:11:11,489
(6 members stand, and 2 members sit.)

2208
01:11:12,888 --> 01:11:15,057
(Seok Jin and Ji Hyo win.)

2209
01:11:15,058 --> 01:11:16,179
I knew it.

2210
01:11:16,327 --> 01:11:17,526
Goodness.

2211
01:11:17,527 --> 01:11:18,967
(The lover of Game of Wits is disappointed.)

2212
01:11:18,968 --> 01:11:21,036
It's best not to move for a game like this.

2213
01:11:21,037 --> 01:11:22,191
You fools.

2214
01:11:23,237 --> 01:11:24,360
You fools.

2215
01:11:24,808 --> 01:11:25,906
(He pretends not to hear.)

2216
01:11:25,907 --> 01:11:27,167
"You're not stupid!"

2217
01:11:27,168 --> 01:11:29,776
(Kwang Soo, You're not stupid.)

2218
01:11:29,777 --> 01:11:31,377
- "You're not stupid!" - I'm really not.

2219
01:11:31,378 --> 01:11:32,646
"You're not stupid!"

2220
01:11:32,647 --> 01:11:34,035
I didn't know you would stand up.

2221
01:11:34,678 --> 01:11:35,677
Seok Jin and Ji Hyo.

2222
01:11:35,678 --> 01:11:39,359
You may give a Venomous Snake Badge or take a Ginseng Badge.

2223
01:11:39,447 --> 01:11:40,743
- Right now? - Yes.

2224
01:11:40,787 --> 01:11:41,786
You don't need to give to So Min.

2225
01:11:41,787 --> 01:11:43,456
Hers will turn into Venomous Snake Badges.

2226
01:11:43,457 --> 01:11:46,356
(Hers will turn into Venomous Snake Badges.)

2227
01:11:46,357 --> 01:11:47,356
So Min.

2228
01:11:47,357 --> 01:11:48,959
- Where is it? - Just imagine...

2229
01:11:49,027 --> 01:11:50,627
- Where is it? - So Min's badges...

2230
01:11:50,628 --> 01:11:51,727
will turn into Venomous Snake Badges.

2231
01:11:51,728 --> 01:11:52,920
You can't win.

2232
01:11:52,968 --> 01:11:55,996
If you find the bomb,

2233
01:11:55,997 --> 01:11:57,597
- I'll give you two Ginseng Badges. - Really?

2234
01:11:57,598 --> 01:11:59,066
(So Min makes a proposal.)

2235
01:11:59,067 --> 01:12:00,137
Yes.

2236
01:12:00,138 --> 01:12:01,337
So Min.

2237
01:12:01,338 --> 01:12:02,477
You can't win.

2238
01:12:02,478 --> 01:12:03,536
I'll explain.

2239
01:12:03,537 --> 01:12:05,343
(Kwang Soo raises his hand.)

2240
01:12:06,577 --> 01:12:07,628
Will you give me two Ginseng Badges?

2241
01:12:07,718 --> 01:12:09,411
- I will... - I'll tell you.

2242
01:12:09,817 --> 01:12:11,286
I'll give you two Ginseng Badges.

2243
01:12:11,287 --> 01:12:12,543
But there's a rule to follow.

2244
01:12:12,688 --> 01:12:13,739
So Min.

2245
01:12:13,947 --> 01:12:15,816
- Wait. - Yes?

2246
01:12:15,817 --> 01:12:19,286
I'll show you that you can win.

2247
01:12:19,287 --> 01:12:20,427
(How will he make So Min win?)

2248
01:12:20,428 --> 01:12:21,518
How?

2249
01:12:22,558 --> 01:12:23,597
Give me your Ginseng Badge.

2250
01:12:23,598 --> 01:12:25,261
(Bring me your Ginseng Badge.)

2251
01:12:25,728 --> 01:12:27,127
(Why mine?)

2252
01:12:27,128 --> 01:12:28,321
- Ginseng. - Ginseng?

2253
01:12:28,768 --> 01:12:29,819
- Ginseng? - Give it to me.

2254
01:12:30,367 --> 01:12:31,694
Seok Jin is being mischievous.

2255
01:12:31,768 --> 01:12:33,637
If So Min finds the bomb,

2256
01:12:33,638 --> 01:12:35,337
he makes it impossible for her to attack him.

2257
01:12:35,338 --> 01:12:37,929
(That's his trick.)

2258
01:12:38,048 --> 01:12:39,706
(Was that it?)

2259
01:12:39,707 --> 01:12:41,717
Seok Jin is sometimes...

2260
01:12:41,718 --> 01:12:43,076
(Jae Seok is too quick.)

2261
01:12:43,077 --> 01:12:44,217
Did you get your turn, Ji Hyo?

2262
01:12:44,218 --> 01:12:45,339
Me?

2263
01:12:45,888 --> 01:12:46,986
Give me one Ginseng.

2264
01:12:46,987 --> 01:12:49,587
(Seok Jin, give me one Ginseng.)

2265
01:12:49,588 --> 01:12:51,187
Why are you taking mine?

2266
01:12:51,188 --> 01:12:52,657
It doesn't matter, right?

2267
01:12:52,758 --> 01:12:54,356
- All right. - Okay.

2268
01:12:54,357 --> 01:12:55,456
- That's good. - What?

2269
01:12:55,457 --> 01:12:57,767
- What? I also won. - Fine.

2270
01:12:57,768 --> 01:12:58,896
(Ji Hyo takes back her Ginseng Badge.)

2271
01:12:58,897 --> 01:12:59,989
Nothing has changed for me.

2272
01:13:00,397 --> 01:13:01,764
- Here's the next round. - Okay.

2273
01:13:02,537 --> 01:13:03,767
1, 2, 3.

2274
01:13:03,768 --> 01:13:04,859
Great.

2275
01:13:05,237 --> 01:13:06,467
(Jae Seok, Ji Hyo, and So Min win.)

2276
01:13:06,468 --> 01:13:07,762
- Nice. - You win if you sit.

2277
01:13:07,838 --> 01:13:09,061
You're like my little brother.

2278
01:13:09,207 --> 01:13:11,246
- I'll take it from Jae Seok. - Okay.

2279
01:13:11,247 --> 01:13:15,531
(Current Badge Status)

2280
01:13:15,577 --> 01:13:17,790
So Min has a lot of Venomous Snake Badges.

2281
01:13:18,218 --> 01:13:19,442
It's not anywhere.

2282
01:13:19,617 --> 01:13:21,830
I can't find it anywhere.

2283
01:13:22,418 --> 01:13:25,038
I don't think he put it in here. It's clear.

2284
01:13:25,258 --> 01:13:27,557
- Take it off and check. - He didn't have the time.

2285
01:13:27,558 --> 01:13:28,823
Here's the last round.

2286
01:13:29,228 --> 01:13:31,982
Can we bet two badges this time?

2287
01:13:33,428 --> 01:13:35,713
(At that time)

2288
01:13:36,397 --> 01:13:39,120
(She finds the bomb inside her cell phone.)

2289
01:13:39,768 --> 01:13:42,226
(How did he hide it here?)

2290
01:13:43,577 --> 01:13:46,158
(During a break after their meal)

2291
01:13:46,747 --> 01:13:50,898
(So Min leaves her cell phone on the table.)

2292
01:13:52,447 --> 01:13:54,486
(She leaves without suspecting anything...)

2293
01:13:54,487 --> 01:13:56,559
(to brush her teeth.)

2294
01:13:56,918 --> 01:14:01,855
(At that time, Kwang Soo finds So Min's cell phone.)

2295
01:14:02,298 --> 01:14:03,927
(To leave a proof,)

2296
01:14:03,928 --> 01:14:05,703
(he even films it himself.)

2297
01:14:06,628 --> 01:14:09,758
(He almost put it inside the case.)

2298
01:14:10,567 --> 01:14:12,507
(Dreaming of a perfect crime,)

2299
01:14:12,508 --> 01:14:16,721
(he puts the bomb behind the sticker.)

2300
01:14:17,008 --> 01:14:19,395
(It's impressive that So Min found it.)

2301
01:14:20,008 --> 01:14:21,477
(Kwang Soo doesn't know that So Min found it.)

2302
01:14:21,478 --> 01:14:24,099
- Two badges are on the line. - Okay.

2303
01:14:24,317 --> 01:14:25,387
One.

2304
01:14:25,388 --> 01:14:26,847
(She pretends not to have found it.)

2305
01:14:26,848 --> 01:14:27,909
I'll stand up.

2306
01:14:27,957 --> 01:14:29,824
(No one noticed.)

2307
01:14:29,957 --> 01:14:30,956
Three.

2308
01:14:30,957 --> 01:14:33,610
(3 members stand, and 5 sit.)

2309
01:14:34,628 --> 01:14:38,239
(Jae Seok, Jong Kook, and So Min win.)

2310
01:14:38,397 --> 01:14:39,597
(How should I transfer the bomb?)

2311
01:14:39,598 --> 01:14:40,727
Congratulations.

2312
01:14:40,728 --> 01:14:42,536
- I should have stood up. - Seriously.

2313
01:14:42,537 --> 01:14:44,337
Let's see.

2314
01:14:44,338 --> 01:14:45,807
I'll give one to Seok Jin.

2315
01:14:45,808 --> 01:14:46,888
Okay.

2316
01:14:47,138 --> 01:14:48,228
Wait.

2317
01:14:48,978 --> 01:14:50,099
What's this?

2318
01:14:51,548 --> 01:14:54,047
(Something falls on Se Chan's hand.)

2319
01:14:54,048 --> 01:14:55,246
- What is it? - Poop fell on me.

2320
01:14:55,247 --> 01:14:57,084
What? Poop fell on you?

2321
01:14:57,247 --> 01:14:59,116
(Did poop fall on him suddenly?)

2322
01:14:59,117 --> 01:15:00,286
Goodness.

2323
01:15:00,287 --> 01:15:01,378
Why did poop fall on you?

2324
01:15:01,758 --> 01:15:03,727
It was yellow and long.

2325
01:15:03,857 --> 01:15:05,227
Even a bird came.

2326
01:15:05,228 --> 01:15:06,727
It looks like a different kind of poop.

2327
01:15:06,728 --> 01:15:07,982
(Kwang Soo goes to check.)

2328
01:15:08,657 --> 01:15:10,534
(This is a chance.)

2329
01:15:10,928 --> 01:15:12,167
What is it?

2330
01:15:12,168 --> 01:15:14,026
(She's about to take out the bomb from her bag.)

2331
01:15:14,027 --> 01:15:16,139
- Gosh! - What is it?

2332
01:15:16,338 --> 01:15:18,167
(She fails because he turned too quickly.)

2333
01:15:18,168 --> 01:15:19,290
Something just fell on me.

2334
01:15:20,037 --> 01:15:21,128
I'll give one to Kwang Soo.

2335
01:15:21,308 --> 01:15:22,665
- Did you give 2? - No, only 1.

2336
01:15:22,678 --> 01:15:24,064
You should give out yours.

2337
01:15:24,338 --> 01:15:25,606
There are six.

2338
01:15:25,607 --> 01:15:27,606
Be honest. If you tell me, I won't give it to you.

2339
01:15:27,607 --> 01:15:30,116
(She continues to act.)

2340
01:15:30,117 --> 01:15:32,286
- You won't find it. - Goodness.

2341
01:15:32,287 --> 01:15:33,646
It's your last chance. I won't give if you tell me.

2342
01:15:33,647 --> 01:15:34,757
(Kwang Soo approaches her.)

2343
01:15:34,758 --> 01:15:37,511
Listen. On page 23 of the book.

2344
01:15:37,817 --> 01:15:40,057
Stop kidding. Tell me just once.

2345
01:15:40,058 --> 01:15:41,352
Then I won't give it to you.

2346
01:15:41,798 --> 01:15:42,826
(Try to find it.)

2347
01:15:42,827 --> 01:15:43,980
Where?

2348
01:15:45,668 --> 01:15:46,891
- You will give me one? - Yes.

2349
01:15:47,428 --> 01:15:48,559
Fine.

2350
01:15:49,737 --> 01:15:51,507
(She couldn't stick the bomb.)

2351
01:15:51,508 --> 01:15:53,807
Everyone, I have no Venomous Snake Badge.

2352
01:15:53,808 --> 01:15:55,377
I have more Venomous Snake Badges.

2353
01:15:55,378 --> 01:15:56,663
(She doesn't have time.)

2354
01:15:56,777 --> 01:15:57,946
Let's play one more round.

2355
01:15:57,947 --> 01:16:00,706
(If it's not easy to stick it on Kwang Soo...)

2356
01:16:00,707 --> 01:16:03,124
(Will she change her target?)

2357
01:16:03,777 --> 01:16:07,898
(Haha is showing his back to So Min.)

2358
01:16:08,218 --> 01:16:09,387
(She's ready to load her bomb.)

2359
01:16:09,388 --> 01:16:11,224
- Last. - How many times will we play?

2360
01:16:11,327 --> 01:16:12,856
It's over.

2361
01:16:12,857 --> 01:16:15,857
(So Min stands behind Haha as naturally as possible.)

2362
01:16:17,058 --> 01:16:20,227
(If So Min secretly sticks it on Haha...)

2363
01:16:20,228 --> 01:16:22,196
For the member who has the Bomb Sticker,

2364
01:16:22,197 --> 01:16:24,381
all of his or her badges will turn into Venomous Snake Badges.

2365
01:16:25,907 --> 01:16:28,477
(Carefully)

2366
01:16:28,478 --> 01:16:31,405
(She tries to put the Bomb Sticker on him.)

2367
01:16:31,607 --> 01:16:34,677
(Will So Min successfully transfer the bomb?)

2368
01:16:34,678 --> 01:16:35,816
What?

2369
01:16:35,817 --> 01:16:37,276
(What was that?)

2370
01:16:38,447 --> 01:16:39,743
(You startled me.)

2371
01:16:40,287 --> 01:16:42,398
(What's going on?)

2372
01:16:43,058 --> 01:16:44,587
(He finds something on the ground.)

2373
01:16:44,588 --> 01:16:46,087
I caught her trying to stick it on me.

2374
01:16:46,088 --> 01:16:48,679
(Look at this.)

2375
01:16:48,997 --> 01:16:50,661
I caught her trying to stick it on me.

2376
01:16:50,827 --> 01:16:53,143
- No. - Look.

2377
01:16:53,527 --> 01:16:56,137
(I'm doomed.)

2378
01:16:56,138 --> 01:16:58,005
- No. - I was right here.

2379
01:16:58,237 --> 01:16:59,767
- Don't deny it. - That's not it.

2380
01:16:59,768 --> 01:17:01,440
- I even helped her. - Did you find it?

2381
01:17:01,478 --> 01:17:03,008
She approached me.

2382
01:17:03,037 --> 01:17:05,017
When I turned around, it was on the ground.

2383
01:17:05,207 --> 01:17:07,007
How could you?

2384
01:17:07,008 --> 01:17:08,343
How did you find it?

2385
01:17:08,848 --> 01:17:10,205
Something was strange.

2386
01:17:10,378 --> 01:17:12,591
- I didn't put it on you. - Wasn't it strange?

2387
01:17:12,617 --> 01:17:14,046
When did you find it?

2388
01:17:14,188 --> 01:17:15,687
I found it a while ago.

2389
01:17:15,688 --> 01:17:17,555
- It was behind my sticker... - That was almost...

2390
01:17:19,357 --> 01:17:21,286
I put it inside the sticker.

2391
01:17:21,287 --> 01:17:22,725
(She tries to stick it on again.)

2392
01:17:22,827 --> 01:17:24,257
She stuck it on me again.

2393
01:17:24,258 --> 01:17:25,492
No.

2394
01:17:26,428 --> 01:17:27,549
She stuck it on me again.

2395
01:17:28,338 --> 01:17:29,337
She did.

2396
01:17:29,338 --> 01:17:30,496
She stuck it on me. I can feel it.

2397
01:17:30,497 --> 01:17:32,139
Can you feel it?

2398
01:17:32,367 --> 01:17:34,036
- She got caught twice. - I put it very lightly.

2399
01:17:34,037 --> 01:17:36,017
- She has many Venomous Snakes. - Can you feel it?

2400
01:17:36,037 --> 01:17:37,057
Yes.

2401
01:17:37,138 --> 01:17:39,307
Everyone will say the last comment.

2402
01:17:39,308 --> 01:17:41,646
So Min, try to transfer it without getting caught.

2403
01:17:41,647 --> 01:17:43,106
Let's start.

2404
01:17:43,777 --> 01:17:45,276
- Say your last comment. - What do we do?

2405
01:17:45,418 --> 01:17:48,243
I have two Venomous Snake Badges.

2406
01:17:48,258 --> 01:17:50,217
- Ji Hyo. - I have three Ginseng Badges.

2407
01:17:50,218 --> 01:17:52,125
I have 3 Ginseng and 2 Venomous Snake Badges.

2408
01:17:52,428 --> 01:17:54,286
- Seok Jin... - She's coming.

2409
01:17:54,287 --> 01:17:55,858
(They stay away from So Min.)

2410
01:17:56,397 --> 01:17:58,815
If she gets caught, she gets another badge.

2411
01:17:59,027 --> 01:18:02,260
I have 1 Ginseng and 4 Venomous Snake Badges.

2412
01:18:02,367 --> 01:18:03,366
I have...

2413
01:18:03,367 --> 01:18:04,866
I can't stick it on.

2414
01:18:04,867 --> 01:18:06,667
This is not how we play it.

2415
01:18:06,668 --> 01:18:08,514
(She lets out an outcry.)

2416
01:18:09,107 --> 01:18:10,906
(How can you do this?)

2417
01:18:10,907 --> 01:18:12,007
Get away.

2418
01:18:12,008 --> 01:18:13,844
I have three Ginseng Badges.

2419
01:18:14,008 --> 01:18:15,375
I have three Ginseng Badges.

2420
01:18:15,617 --> 01:18:17,816
I have five Venomous Snake Badges.

2421
01:18:17,817 --> 01:18:20,367
(He's full of confidence.)

2422
01:18:20,647 --> 01:18:22,524
(Approaching)

2423
01:18:23,218 --> 01:18:26,522
(She tries to stick the bomb on Seok Jin.)

2424
01:18:27,357 --> 01:18:30,156
(Didn't Seok Jin notice at all?)

2425
01:18:30,157 --> 01:18:32,196
- So Min stuck it on here. - No.

2426
01:18:32,197 --> 01:18:33,493
(He was waiting for it.)

2427
01:18:33,968 --> 01:18:35,467
- Here it is. - She got caught.

2428
01:18:35,468 --> 01:18:36,937
- No. - Give her one more.

2429
01:18:36,938 --> 01:18:38,307
I could feel it. Give her one more.

2430
01:18:38,308 --> 01:18:39,437
No.

2431
01:18:39,438 --> 01:18:41,437
- I could feel it. - How could you know?

2432
01:18:41,438 --> 01:18:42,536
I felt it.

2433
01:18:42,537 --> 01:18:44,977
I thought he'd pretend not to know.

2434
01:18:44,978 --> 01:18:45,977
I thought he'd pretend not to know.

2435
01:18:45,978 --> 01:18:47,106
How could he...

2436
01:18:47,107 --> 01:18:48,883
I was hoping that she'd stick it on me.

2437
01:18:49,817 --> 01:18:51,684
- She stuck it on my clothes. - On your clothes?

2438
01:18:51,718 --> 01:18:52,717
On my clothes.

2439
01:18:52,718 --> 01:18:54,517
Let's finish up.

2440
01:18:54,518 --> 01:18:55,656
It'll be all over after So Min's ending comment.

2441
01:18:55,657 --> 01:18:57,356
I have 5 Venomous Snake Badges and 2 Ginseng Badges.

2442
01:18:57,357 --> 01:18:58,715
(So Min's badge status)

2443
01:18:58,957 --> 01:19:00,284
Her Ginseng Badges will change.

2444
01:19:00,857 --> 01:19:03,396
- Okay. - Today...

2445
01:19:03,397 --> 01:19:05,667
- Isn't it valid on the bag? - She stuck it on the bag.

2446
01:19:05,668 --> 01:19:08,351
(Wait a minute.)

2447
01:19:08,838 --> 01:19:11,388
(Did she stick the Bomb Sticker on the bag?)

2448
01:19:11,808 --> 01:19:14,286
(Before So Min made her ending comment,)

2449
01:19:15,308 --> 01:19:17,776
(she put the Bomb Sticker...)

2450
01:19:17,777 --> 01:19:20,206
(on someone's bag behind a stool.)

2451
01:19:20,207 --> 01:19:22,258
- Whose bag is it? - She stuck it on the bag.

2452
01:19:23,317 --> 01:19:25,939
(To whom does the bag belong?)

2453
01:19:26,487 --> 01:19:27,847
Whose bag is it?

2454
01:19:27,848 --> 01:19:29,257
- Who sat on the fourth stool? - Who was it?

2455
01:19:29,258 --> 01:19:30,986
(Whose bag is it?)

2456
01:19:30,987 --> 01:19:32,257
Isn't it Ji Hyo's?

2457
01:19:32,258 --> 01:19:33,656
- It's Ji Hyo's. - Mine was the third.

2458
01:19:33,657 --> 01:19:35,841
(The bag belongs to Ji Hyo.)

2459
01:19:36,527 --> 01:19:37,627
It's Ji Hyo's.

2460
01:19:37,628 --> 01:19:39,301
(Is it me?)

2461
01:19:40,027 --> 01:19:41,629
- It's Ji Hyo. - It is.

2462
01:19:41,938 --> 01:19:43,437
- Ji Hyo. - It's your bag, Ji Hyo.

2463
01:19:43,438 --> 01:19:44,458
Ji Hyo.

2464
01:19:44,697 --> 01:19:45,837
- Look. - It's Ji Hyo's bag.

2465
01:19:45,838 --> 01:19:47,234
How...

2466
01:19:47,407 --> 01:19:49,580
This is a twist.

2467
01:19:49,838 --> 01:19:51,137
Is it Ji Hyo's bag?

2468
01:19:51,138 --> 01:19:53,007
I put it on a random bag.

2469
01:19:53,008 --> 01:19:55,746
Ji Hyo has three Ginseng, but she got the bomb.

2470
01:19:55,747 --> 01:19:57,547
- 3 Venomous Snake Badges. - She has 3 Venomous Snake Badges.

2471
01:19:57,548 --> 01:19:59,995
(All three Ginseng Badges turn into Venomous Snake Badges.)

2472
01:20:01,388 --> 01:20:03,087
(Ji Hyo's final badge status is three Venomous Snake Badges.)

2473
01:20:03,088 --> 01:20:04,717
She transferred it at the last moment.

2474
01:20:04,718 --> 01:20:06,057
I didn't know that it was yours.

2475
01:20:06,058 --> 01:20:07,526
I had no idea.

2476
01:20:07,527 --> 01:20:09,627
You got tricked because you let down your guard.

2477
01:20:09,628 --> 01:20:10,856
Goodness.

2478
01:20:10,857 --> 01:20:11,918
(All of Ji Hyo's nicknames become negative.)

2479
01:20:13,897 --> 01:20:16,337
Jae Seok, the winner,

2480
01:20:16,338 --> 01:20:17,637
can pick a nickname for each member.

2481
01:20:17,638 --> 01:20:19,467
I'll pick Song Van for Ji Hyo.

2482
01:20:19,468 --> 01:20:20,762
Ms. 40, Song Van.

2483
01:20:20,938 --> 01:20:22,307
Not Close Friends with Kwang Soo.

2484
01:20:22,308 --> 01:20:24,481
(Ms 40, Song Van, and Not Close Friends with Kwang Soo)

2485
01:20:24,508 --> 01:20:26,007
One of them should be Cherished Comedian.

2486
01:20:26,008 --> 01:20:27,639
Add Be As Tall as 3m.

2487
01:20:27,777 --> 01:20:29,858
What if I get as tall as 3m?

2488
01:20:30,117 --> 01:20:31,246
Unloved Frog.

2489
01:20:31,247 --> 01:20:32,946
- Unloved Frog is cute. - Yes.

2490
01:20:32,947 --> 01:20:35,201
(Crazy Poet, Really Foolish, and Unloved Frog)

2491
01:20:35,218 --> 01:20:36,887
- Romantic Punch. - That's a good one.

2492
01:20:36,888 --> 01:20:38,627
- Yes, Romantic Punch. - Romantic Punch?

2493
01:20:38,628 --> 01:20:41,137
(Romantic Punch)

2494
01:20:41,258 --> 01:20:43,557
Add Sycophant and Petty Greedy.

2495
01:20:43,558 --> 01:20:46,127
(Jee Stream, Sycophant, and Petty Greedy)

2496
01:20:46,128 --> 01:20:47,861
I'll pick Young Jin's Imitator.

2497
01:20:48,567 --> 01:20:49,797
Come on.

2498
01:20:49,798 --> 01:20:52,667
(Young Jin is Haha's stylist.)

2499
01:20:52,668 --> 01:20:55,036
- I'll pick these 2 and 1. - Okay.

2500
01:20:55,037 --> 01:20:56,637
I like Mouth Like Mount Baekdu.

2501
01:20:56,638 --> 01:20:57,877
I'll include Mouth Like Mount Baekdu.

2502
01:20:57,878 --> 01:21:00,561
(Playful Child, Mouth Like Mount Baekdu, and Kind and Cool Man)

2503
01:21:00,808 --> 01:21:03,062
Se Chan is And Se Chan.

2504
01:21:03,077 --> 01:21:05,087
- Why? - "And Se Chan"?

2505
01:21:05,487 --> 01:21:06,746
Is it just my name?

2506
01:21:06,747 --> 01:21:07,917
(Se Chan's is "And Se Chan".)

2507
01:21:07,918 --> 01:21:09,182
Isn't that a worse punishment?

2508
01:21:09,357 --> 01:21:11,116
- It is funny. - Right.

2509
01:21:11,117 --> 01:21:13,286
Se Chan's nickname is funny.

2510
01:21:13,287 --> 01:21:15,496
The audience will say, "And Se Chan".

2511
01:21:15,497 --> 01:21:17,904
(Thousands of people will shout out his name.)

2512
01:21:18,128 --> 01:21:19,967
(He likes it as he hears it.)

2513
01:21:19,968 --> 01:21:21,066
It's done.

2514
01:21:21,067 --> 01:21:23,267
The nicknames for the lyrics have been picked.

2515
01:21:23,268 --> 01:21:26,470
- We'll discuss and make a song. - Then...

2516
01:21:27,168 --> 01:21:28,706
- we're leaving. - Where?

2517
01:21:28,707 --> 01:21:29,906
- See you tomorrow. - See you tomorrow.

2518
01:21:29,907 --> 01:21:31,036
- See you tomorrow. - We have work tomorrow.

2519
01:21:31,037 --> 01:21:32,408
- We'll see each other tomorrow. - Right.
