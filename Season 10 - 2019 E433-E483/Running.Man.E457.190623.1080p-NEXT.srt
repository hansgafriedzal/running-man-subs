1
00:00:05,434 --> 00:00:07,034
- Hello. - Hi.

2
00:00:07,035 --> 00:00:08,333
- Hi. - Hello.

3
00:00:08,334 --> 00:00:09,634
- Hello, Jong Kook. - Hi.

4
00:00:09,635 --> 00:00:11,073
- Hello. - Look at you, Jong Kook.

5
00:00:11,074 --> 00:00:12,333
- You're wearing a white shirt. - Look at his outfit.

6
00:00:12,334 --> 00:00:13,374
- You're wearing a white outfit. - What?

7
00:00:13,375 --> 00:00:15,274
- It has a picture too. - Goodness, Jong Kook.

8
00:00:15,275 --> 00:00:16,543
- That's so cute. - What a fancy shirt.

9
00:00:16,544 --> 00:00:18,014
- There's a picture? - What a cute outfit.

10
00:00:18,015 --> 00:00:20,136
When people get old, they like fancy outfits.

11
00:00:20,585 --> 00:00:21,821
(He can totally relate to it.)

12
00:00:21,945 --> 00:00:24,119
(What?)

13
00:00:24,315 --> 00:00:25,683
There's something Jae Seok...

14
00:00:25,684 --> 00:00:27,683
- has to apologize to So Min for? - Listen. I should apologize to her.

15
00:00:27,684 --> 00:00:29,624
I wasn't trying to set her up with a guy.

16
00:00:29,625 --> 00:00:30,624
(Did he set up a date for her?)

17
00:00:30,625 --> 00:00:31,854
I saw that. I saw the show.

18
00:00:31,855 --> 00:00:33,794
- Me too. I saw it too. - I heard Sae Ho was in the area.

19
00:00:33,795 --> 00:00:35,523
I was talking to Sae Ho.

20
00:00:35,524 --> 00:00:37,163
He said he was lonely, so I told him about So Min.

21
00:00:37,164 --> 00:00:38,533
But I didn't ask So Min if she wanted the date.

22
00:00:38,534 --> 00:00:39,834
You didn't ask her first.

23
00:00:39,835 --> 00:00:41,483
(What's the whole story behind the blind date incident?)

24
00:00:42,005 --> 00:00:44,273
(Jae Seok asked Sae Ho about how he thought about So Min.)

25
00:00:44,274 --> 00:00:45,954
(Trailing)

26
00:00:47,875 --> 00:00:50,111
(He suddenly recommends Nam Chang Hee.)

27
00:00:50,875 --> 00:00:53,800
(He feels bad to So Min for bringing her up.)

28
00:00:54,214 --> 00:00:55,843
- I was so flustered. - Really?

29
00:00:55,844 --> 00:00:57,213
I'm so sorry, So Min.

30
00:00:57,214 --> 00:00:59,626
- Did you watch that? - I did. Sae Ho...

31
00:00:59,714 --> 00:01:01,624
I mean when you're on a show, you try to be polite about it.

32
00:01:01,625 --> 00:01:03,054
- You should if you can. - That would be nice.

33
00:01:03,055 --> 00:01:04,594
But he looked he was totally offended.

34
00:01:04,595 --> 00:01:06,449
(He straightened his face.)

35
00:01:06,524 --> 00:01:08,245
- He did that? - Yes.

36
00:01:08,324 --> 00:01:09,424
- He looked offended? - So Min.

37
00:01:09,425 --> 00:01:11,034
- That's an exaggeration. - That was...

38
00:01:11,035 --> 00:01:14,334
So Min publicly announced that she's available and lonely.

39
00:01:14,335 --> 00:01:16,034
- Right. I'm on the market now. - That's why I asked.

40
00:01:16,035 --> 00:01:17,073
- I... - No one is making a move.

41
00:01:17,074 --> 00:01:19,933
- I thought about Jong Min. - No one made a move.

42
00:01:19,934 --> 00:01:21,144
Jong Min seemed to like the idea.

43
00:01:21,145 --> 00:01:22,144
- He liked it. - Really?

44
00:01:22,145 --> 00:01:24,144
- He said he liked her. - But I bet she doesn't like him.

45
00:01:24,145 --> 00:01:25,773
- But So Min doesn't like him. - Look at her.

46
00:01:25,774 --> 00:01:26,773
(Shaking her head)

47
00:01:26,774 --> 00:01:28,144
- No, he's great. - She knows her types too well.

48
00:01:28,145 --> 00:01:29,584
- Why do we keep setting her up... - He's not dumb.

49
00:01:29,585 --> 00:01:31,747
- with guys on variety shows? - He's not dumb.

50
00:01:32,555 --> 00:01:34,054
- Won't she... - Stop it.

51
00:01:34,055 --> 00:01:35,954
- Won't she be a comedienne soon? - No, listen.

52
00:01:35,955 --> 00:01:38,353
- She's switching like Kwang Soo. - But still.

53
00:01:38,354 --> 00:01:39,766
- Isn't she a comedienne? - Of course.

54
00:01:39,794 --> 00:01:42,094
So Min will have to pay the membership fee pretty soon.

55
00:01:42,095 --> 00:01:43,424
Right. She's almost a comedienne now.

56
00:01:43,425 --> 00:01:44,734
And Kwang Soo is behind his fees.

57
00:01:44,735 --> 00:01:45,834
I'm behind my fees?

58
00:01:45,835 --> 00:01:47,734
- You're behind your fees. - My goodness.

59
00:01:47,735 --> 00:01:48,963
You're unbelievable.

60
00:01:48,964 --> 00:01:50,932
Would you choose Sae Ho over Jong Min though?

61
00:01:51,434 --> 00:01:52,474
- Choose 1 between the 2. - All right.

62
00:01:52,475 --> 00:01:53,704
- Jong Min versus Sae Ho. - It's too hard.

63
00:01:53,705 --> 00:01:54,773
- Jong Min versus Sae Ho. - Jong Min versus Sae Ho.

64
00:01:54,774 --> 00:01:56,344
- One... You must choose right away. - Jong Min's a good guy.

65
00:01:56,345 --> 00:01:57,373
1, 2, 3.

66
00:01:57,374 --> 00:01:58,474
Nam Chang Hee.

67
00:01:58,475 --> 00:02:00,782
(She makes an unexpected decision.)

68
00:02:01,145 --> 00:02:02,413
- Nam Chang Hee? - He's nice too.

69
00:02:02,414 --> 00:02:04,513
- Nam Chang Hee. - He's a great singer.

70
00:02:04,514 --> 00:02:05,614
- I like guys who can sing. - Chang Hee is?

71
00:02:05,615 --> 00:02:06,924
- Is that so? - Jong Min is super good.

72
00:02:06,925 --> 00:02:08,604
- He can sing and dance. - Hey, Jong Min is...

73
00:02:08,754 --> 00:02:10,814
- a singer. - That's right. That's true.

74
00:02:10,855 --> 00:02:12,677
- My goodness. - He's such a great singer.

75
00:02:12,694 --> 00:02:14,620
Besides, Jong Min isn't stupid.

76
00:02:14,694 --> 00:02:16,394
- He's totally fine. - Hey, hey.

77
00:02:16,395 --> 00:02:18,042
It's Kwang Soo who's not stupid.

78
00:02:18,194 --> 00:02:20,193
- "You're not stupid!" - "You're not stupid."

79
00:02:20,194 --> 00:02:21,403
- "You're not stupid!" - I'm really not stupid.

80
00:02:21,404 --> 00:02:22,664
Isn't that obvious?

81
00:02:22,665 --> 00:02:24,736
- Both of them aren't stupid. - That's so obvious.

82
00:02:25,335 --> 00:02:26,777
You're not attracted...

83
00:02:27,444 --> 00:02:28,773
to Se Chan at all.

84
00:02:28,774 --> 00:02:29,903
- So Min? - Me?

85
00:02:29,904 --> 00:02:31,514
- There's no potential either. - I'm not interested in her.

86
00:02:31,515 --> 00:02:32,750
Seok Jin, we're done with that topic.

87
00:02:32,774 --> 00:02:33,843
When did that end?

88
00:02:33,844 --> 00:02:34,943
(Cutting him off)

89
00:02:34,944 --> 00:02:36,384
(Getting angry)

90
00:02:36,385 --> 00:02:37,713
- When did that end? - It's because the writer...

91
00:02:37,714 --> 00:02:38,984
flipped over the page.

92
00:02:38,985 --> 00:02:41,223
- We just started this topic. - We're on another topic now.

93
00:02:41,224 --> 00:02:43,696
- It was a bridge to another topic. - It ended with her answer.

94
00:02:43,895 --> 00:02:45,753
- It was over when she answered. - When she answered,

95
00:02:45,754 --> 00:02:47,523
- the conversation was over. - Right. It was over.

96
00:02:47,524 --> 00:02:48,523
By the way, how do you know Pogba?

97
00:02:48,524 --> 00:02:49,794
- You took a photo with him. - It was on your social media.

98
00:02:49,795 --> 00:02:51,234
I saw the photo on your social media.

99
00:02:51,235 --> 00:02:53,164
I've never seen him looking so small with someone else.

100
00:02:53,165 --> 00:02:54,933
I've never seen someone put his hand around his shoulder...

101
00:02:54,934 --> 00:02:56,704
- like he's a baby. - I know. That's the photo.

102
00:02:56,705 --> 00:02:57,704
Jong Kook looked like this.

103
00:02:57,705 --> 00:02:58,933
(Baby Jong Kook)

104
00:02:58,934 --> 00:03:00,373
By the way, I was really surprised.

105
00:03:00,374 --> 00:03:01,903
Pogba is as tall as Kwang Soo,

106
00:03:01,904 --> 00:03:03,110
but his body proportion is totally different.

107
00:03:03,374 --> 00:03:04,574
- Is that so? - What's wrong with my body?

108
00:03:04,575 --> 00:03:05,743
It's always different with Kwang Soo.

109
00:03:05,744 --> 00:03:07,804
This is the height I'm used to.

110
00:03:07,844 --> 00:03:09,255
But he didn't look the same.

111
00:03:09,444 --> 00:03:12,054
- Pogba has a muscular body. - It wasn't just his body.

112
00:03:12,055 --> 00:03:13,554
And his face was as small as this.

113
00:03:13,555 --> 00:03:15,584
(It wasn't just his body. And his face was as small as this.)

114
00:03:15,585 --> 00:03:16,623
I mean...

115
00:03:16,624 --> 00:03:19,253
- His body proportion must be great. - It's no joke.

116
00:03:19,254 --> 00:03:20,842
But Pogba isn't considered handsome.

117
00:03:21,564 --> 00:03:23,193
- Come on, Kwang Soo. - He's a world-class athlete.

118
00:03:23,194 --> 00:03:24,864
- No, he's handsome. - Right.

119
00:03:24,865 --> 00:03:27,033
He's not considered handsome, but if you're going to be tall,

120
00:03:27,034 --> 00:03:28,817
you should have his physical traits.

121
00:03:29,165 --> 00:03:30,634
- You're Bogba. - Not your physical traits.

122
00:03:30,635 --> 00:03:31,873
- You're Bogba. - Bogba.

123
00:03:31,874 --> 00:03:33,003
- Bogba. - What?

124
00:03:33,004 --> 00:03:34,743
- How do you know him? - I heard that he was...

125
00:03:34,744 --> 00:03:36,003
coming to Korea.

126
00:03:36,004 --> 00:03:37,179
Did he contact you?

127
00:03:37,374 --> 00:03:39,044
No, I got a call from someone who knows him.

128
00:03:39,045 --> 00:03:40,971
- From his agency? - I got a call from them.

129
00:03:41,045 --> 00:03:42,218
- Okay. - We filmed together.

130
00:03:42,344 --> 00:03:43,797
And we played soccer together.

131
00:03:44,015 --> 00:03:45,614
I went easy on him just in case he got injured.

132
00:03:45,615 --> 00:03:47,954
(I went easy on him just in case he got injured.)

133
00:03:49,624 --> 00:03:51,894
(This is a totally subjective opinion.)

134
00:03:51,895 --> 00:03:54,023
- Hey, you went easy on him? - I'm telling the truth.

135
00:03:54,024 --> 00:03:56,193
- He's unbelievable. - Jong Kook, I don't believe you.

136
00:03:56,194 --> 00:03:57,433
- Really? - I'm being serious.

137
00:03:57,434 --> 00:03:58,433
- You know what? - He's unbelievable.

138
00:03:58,434 --> 00:03:59,563
I fell during the match.

139
00:03:59,564 --> 00:04:00,764
I think that part probably will air.

140
00:04:00,765 --> 00:04:02,413
- He fell once. - Let me be perfectly clear.

141
00:04:02,635 --> 00:04:03,665
If you look closely,

142
00:04:04,034 --> 00:04:06,063
I kicked Pogba's foot by accident.

143
00:04:06,274 --> 00:04:08,850
I was so surprised, pulled back my foot, and fell.

144
00:04:09,004 --> 00:04:10,561
I'm telling the truth. You should watch it.

145
00:04:11,814 --> 00:04:13,287
I kicked Pogba's foot by accident.

146
00:04:13,684 --> 00:04:16,218
I was so surprised, pulled back my foot, and fell.

147
00:04:16,384 --> 00:04:20,269
(He did his best to go easy on a 200-million-dollar soccer player.)

148
00:04:20,384 --> 00:04:21,765
My goodness.

149
00:04:21,785 --> 00:04:23,183
All right. Today,

150
00:04:23,184 --> 00:04:25,094
we'll have a break from the Fan-meet Project.

151
00:04:25,095 --> 00:04:27,823
We've prepared this race for you who are preparing for the fan-meet.

152
00:04:27,824 --> 00:04:30,266
It's called Invigorating Food of Alley Restaurants Race.

153
00:04:30,894 --> 00:04:32,234
- Really? - Will Baek Jong Won join us today?

154
00:04:32,235 --> 00:04:34,161
- It's a reward. This is so nice. - Will Mr. Baek join us?

155
00:04:34,165 --> 00:04:35,987
- We ought to eat. - Yes, let's eat some food.

156
00:04:36,004 --> 00:04:37,333
- I ate the triangular gimbap. - Me too. I shouldn't have eaten it.

157
00:04:37,334 --> 00:04:38,474
- I ate the triangular gimbap. - Me too. I shouldn't have eaten it.

158
00:04:38,475 --> 00:04:39,703
To improve your health,

159
00:04:39,704 --> 00:04:42,765
two guests recommended restaurants in Mapo-gu and Seodaemun-gu.

160
00:04:43,504 --> 00:04:45,844
- Haha knows a lot of restaurants. - Right. He's from Mapo-gu.

161
00:04:45,845 --> 00:04:47,114
- There are many great restaurants. - He lives in Mapo.

162
00:04:47,115 --> 00:04:49,583
Two guests recommended restaurants in Mapo-gu...

163
00:04:49,584 --> 00:04:51,027
- and Seodaemun-gu. - Really?

164
00:04:51,084 --> 00:04:52,214
- They made the recommendations? - Is that so?

165
00:04:52,215 --> 00:04:54,924
Let me introduce you to two guests who will join you on the race.

166
00:04:54,925 --> 00:04:56,707
- Please come on out. - Who are they?

167
00:04:58,095 --> 00:04:59,193
- Who are they? - Where are they coming from?

168
00:04:59,194 --> 00:05:00,893
(Who are these guests...)

169
00:05:00,894 --> 00:05:03,933
(that will join the race with the members?)

170
00:05:03,934 --> 00:05:04,964
Who are they?

171
00:05:04,965 --> 00:05:07,133
Welcome Chungha and Seol In Ah.

172
00:05:07,134 --> 00:05:08,364
(Midnight Fairy, Chungha)

173
00:05:08,365 --> 00:05:09,672
(Master of Breakdance Freeze, Seol In Ah)

174
00:05:10,475 --> 00:05:13,133
(She showed groundbreaking freezes whenever she starred on the show.)

175
00:05:13,134 --> 00:05:16,235
(What will she show us today? "Freeze" your channel!)

176
00:05:17,045 --> 00:05:20,114
(When it hits midnight, everyone thinks of this singer.)

177
00:05:20,115 --> 00:05:23,284
(Chungha, this amazing dancer, changes when she starts dancing.)

178
00:05:23,285 --> 00:05:26,139
Why don't you introduce yourselves? In Ah. Chungha.

179
00:05:26,155 --> 00:05:27,854
Hello, my name is Seol In Ah.

180
00:05:27,855 --> 00:05:29,575
- I'm taking a break... - She's taking a break.

181
00:05:30,124 --> 00:05:31,794
after "Special Labor Inspector Jo Jang-Poong".

182
00:05:31,795 --> 00:05:33,763
- My goodness. - This is nice.

183
00:05:33,764 --> 00:05:36,063
- "Jo Jang-Poong". - She's taking a break.

184
00:05:36,064 --> 00:05:38,773
- Right. - You're on a break after the drama.

185
00:05:39,334 --> 00:05:41,133
I heard that this episode will air...

186
00:05:41,134 --> 00:05:42,904
- on June 23. - That's right.

187
00:05:42,905 --> 00:05:45,933
- My album will be out on June 24. - That's right.

188
00:05:45,934 --> 00:05:47,831
- My name is Chungha. - She must've come for a reason.

189
00:05:47,975 --> 00:05:50,035
- "She must've come for a reason." - I'm glad too.

190
00:05:50,105 --> 00:05:52,133
- You said she must have a reason. - Okay.

191
00:05:52,175 --> 00:05:54,719
With Chungha, we'll be exchanging favors.

192
00:05:54,845 --> 00:05:56,535
- That's right. - I hope you get what you came for.

193
00:05:56,985 --> 00:05:59,083
- What did you say? - I hope your song wins first place.

194
00:05:59,084 --> 00:06:01,024
- It will win first place. - Her songs always do well.

195
00:06:01,025 --> 00:06:02,054
- Her songs sweep the charts. - Right.

196
00:06:02,055 --> 00:06:04,854
- It's hard to be in the top 100. - Right.

197
00:06:04,855 --> 00:06:06,253
- Don't you agree? - That's right.

198
00:06:06,254 --> 00:06:07,502
What do you know about music?

199
00:06:07,925 --> 00:06:09,645
Kwang Soo is a comedian.

200
00:06:10,064 --> 00:06:11,579
Why are you two talking about music charts?

201
00:06:12,194 --> 00:06:13,904
- They have nothing to do with it. - Right.

202
00:06:13,905 --> 00:06:15,604
- Why are they talking about it? - I scolded him.

203
00:06:15,605 --> 00:06:18,073
What do you know about music? Didn't I tell you?

204
00:06:18,074 --> 00:06:19,372
Then should I have said it's easy then?

205
00:06:19,634 --> 00:06:20,736
Be quiet.

206
00:06:20,775 --> 00:06:21,907
Stay out of this.

207
00:06:23,045 --> 00:06:25,487
Chungha, let's talk about your new song.

208
00:06:25,675 --> 00:06:26,813
What's the title?

209
00:06:26,814 --> 00:06:29,643
- It's called "Snapping". - "Snacking"?

210
00:06:29,644 --> 00:06:30,714
"Snapping".

211
00:06:30,715 --> 00:06:33,083
- Can you show us a snippet? - Really?

212
00:06:33,355 --> 00:06:34,591
I bet this is going to be another great song.

213
00:06:35,124 --> 00:06:37,009
- I can't wait to see her dance. - Chungha...

214
00:06:38,394 --> 00:06:39,623
My gosh, it's nice.

215
00:06:39,624 --> 00:06:41,464
(What kind of performance will she put on for this song?)

216
00:06:41,465 --> 00:06:42,597
Didn't it start?

217
00:06:42,764 --> 00:06:44,133
- It hasn't started yet. - It didn't, right?

218
00:06:44,134 --> 00:06:45,741
- Not yet. You'll know. - It didn't start yet.

219
00:06:49,134 --> 00:06:50,604
(Her posture suddenly changes.)

220
00:06:50,605 --> 00:06:51,833
Did you see that just now?

221
00:06:51,834 --> 00:06:53,433
(No way! That was so cool!)

222
00:06:53,434 --> 00:06:54,608
This song sounds great.

223
00:06:56,175 --> 00:06:58,873
(She changes completely as she starts dancing.)

224
00:06:58,874 --> 00:07:00,636
- This is fantastic. - You didn't see it, did you?

225
00:07:02,485 --> 00:07:04,484
- How can she move like that? - This is so hard.

226
00:07:04,485 --> 00:07:07,090
(The girl with a small build exudes crazy energy.)

227
00:07:07,425 --> 00:07:09,284
- Haha, did you see the beginning? - I saw it.

228
00:07:09,285 --> 00:07:10,975
Hey, did you see her facial expression at first?

229
00:07:11,025 --> 00:07:12,424
She looked all shy in the beginning.

230
00:07:12,425 --> 00:07:13,724
- She went like this. - I got goosebumps.

231
00:07:13,725 --> 00:07:15,193
- I was so surprised. - Seriously.

232
00:07:15,194 --> 00:07:16,739
- Her facial expression... - It totally changed.

233
00:07:17,064 --> 00:07:20,712
You know what? I bet it will only take 10 minutes for Chungha...

234
00:07:21,264 --> 00:07:22,913
- to learn our group dance. - What? 10 minutes?

235
00:07:22,965 --> 00:07:24,304
- Right. - It will take her five minutes.

236
00:07:24,305 --> 00:07:25,674
- Hey. - That's so true.

237
00:07:25,704 --> 00:07:27,243
- She'd master it. - She's so good.

238
00:07:27,244 --> 00:07:28,943
- Her facial expression changed. - That was so nice.

239
00:07:28,944 --> 00:07:30,544
That was crazy.

240
00:07:30,545 --> 00:07:31,774
I bet it's a nice song.

241
00:07:31,775 --> 00:07:34,544
I heard that In Ah and Chungha went to the same dance school...

242
00:07:34,545 --> 00:07:36,943
- in high school. - Really?

243
00:07:36,944 --> 00:07:38,253
- Really? - That's right.

244
00:07:38,514 --> 00:07:40,583
Is this your first time meeting after the dance school?

245
00:07:40,584 --> 00:07:41,583
- No. - No.

246
00:07:41,584 --> 00:07:43,623
We hung out whenever we could while working.

247
00:07:43,624 --> 00:07:45,224
Are you two in the same age group?

248
00:07:45,225 --> 00:07:46,354
- Yes. We're the same age. - We're the same age.

249
00:07:46,355 --> 00:07:47,705
- You're the same age? - You're the same age?

250
00:07:48,564 --> 00:07:51,094
(I see. You're the same age.)

251
00:07:51,095 --> 00:07:52,640
Why are you surprised?

252
00:07:52,694 --> 00:07:54,148
- Why? - They're the same age?

253
00:07:54,504 --> 00:07:56,234
- We weren't surprised. - Why?

254
00:07:56,235 --> 00:07:58,073
- Don't look so surprised. - I was thinking of something else.

255
00:07:58,074 --> 00:08:00,372
- That was a habit. It's my habit. - Listen.

256
00:08:00,574 --> 00:08:02,104
I'm sorry. I react like that out of habit.

257
00:08:02,105 --> 00:08:04,073
- She just looks mature. - That's right.

258
00:08:04,074 --> 00:08:05,243
- In Ah looks like her age. - That's not important.

259
00:08:05,244 --> 00:08:06,573
- Chungha looks so young. - Let's give it up for her.

260
00:08:06,574 --> 00:08:07,784
(Let's give it up for In Ah who looks mature.)

261
00:08:07,785 --> 00:08:10,009
- This is pity applause. - No, no.

262
00:08:10,215 --> 00:08:12,626
- We're rooting for you. - Let's see when you turn 40.

263
00:08:12,754 --> 00:08:15,224
- Don't worry. It'll stop there. - Because... Right.

264
00:08:15,225 --> 00:08:17,728
- What you said made this weirder. - If you're serious, it's weirder.

265
00:08:17,754 --> 00:08:19,594
- Stop it. - I looked like this in Turbo.

266
00:08:19,595 --> 00:08:20,724
- Stop it. - I'm being serious.

267
00:08:20,725 --> 00:08:22,547
- That's not helping. - Why not?

268
00:08:22,795 --> 00:08:24,294
I'll be honest. We're just taking care of you.

269
00:08:24,295 --> 00:08:26,964
Soo Mi had the grandma role when she was young.

270
00:08:26,965 --> 00:08:28,664
(It's the nail in the coffin.)

271
00:08:28,665 --> 00:08:29,933
Come on. Don't say stuff like that.

272
00:08:29,934 --> 00:08:31,315
- How far will you go with this? - You bet.

273
00:08:31,374 --> 00:08:33,393
- How far will this go? - "Country Diaries".

274
00:08:33,434 --> 00:08:35,244
- That's right. - Your spectrum will widen.

275
00:08:35,245 --> 00:08:36,644
Listen. These two used to...

276
00:08:36,645 --> 00:08:39,324
- go to the same dance school. - Yes.

277
00:08:39,415 --> 00:08:41,753
They prepared a performance for "Gotta Go".

278
00:08:42,415 --> 00:08:45,238
- Let's give them a big hand. - All right.

279
00:08:45,584 --> 00:08:46,790
I can't wait.

280
00:08:48,814 --> 00:08:53,814

281
00:08:55,995 --> 00:08:58,672
(In Ah is good too!)

282
00:09:00,395 --> 00:09:04,114
(Her dancing skill is as good as Chungha's.)

283
00:09:05,474 --> 00:09:07,534
(In Ah is great.)

284
00:09:07,745 --> 00:09:09,145
- My gosh. - You guys are great.

285
00:09:09,245 --> 00:09:10,965
- She's a great dancer. - Great.

286
00:09:12,245 --> 00:09:14,407
(He's smiling broadly. "Both of them are great.")

287
00:09:15,684 --> 00:09:18,514
(The original singer is doing her best.)

288
00:09:18,515 --> 00:09:19,823
- That'll be enough. - She's like a machine.

289
00:09:20,484 --> 00:09:22,483
- The song is good any time. - You were great.

290
00:09:22,484 --> 00:09:23,924
- You are a great dancer. - No, no.

291
00:09:23,925 --> 00:09:25,851
- By the way, - This move was great.

292
00:09:26,055 --> 00:09:28,229
- they look different when dancing. - This was great.

293
00:09:28,324 --> 00:09:31,251
By the way, I was a bit disappointed by Chungha.

294
00:09:31,334 --> 00:09:33,394
- In Ah is a great dancer, you know. - Yes.

295
00:09:33,395 --> 00:09:35,333
- She danced harder to show off. - No.

296
00:09:35,334 --> 00:09:37,374
(She danced harder to show off.)

297
00:09:37,375 --> 00:09:38,973
She won't go easy on In Ah.

298
00:09:38,974 --> 00:09:41,066
- That made me root for In Ah more. - You did that, Chungha.

299
00:09:41,145 --> 00:09:43,103
- Chungha danced harder. - Right.

300
00:09:43,104 --> 00:09:45,278
Including these two guests,

301
00:09:45,444 --> 00:09:47,196
you will participate in the race as individuals.

302
00:09:47,245 --> 00:09:49,044
- It's an individual match? - It's an individual match?

303
00:09:49,045 --> 00:09:51,113
As long as you spend a lot of money, you can win the race.

304
00:09:51,114 --> 00:09:53,143
It's Zero Balance Race.

305
00:09:54,255 --> 00:09:55,490
- We have to spend money? - Zero Balance?

306
00:09:56,084 --> 00:09:58,154
We'll give out the cellphones for your mission.

307
00:09:58,155 --> 00:10:01,390
You can spend 30 dollars with your cellphones.

308
00:10:01,964 --> 00:10:04,264
The way you can spend the mission money is very simple.

309
00:10:04,265 --> 00:10:06,034
You will visit restaurants the guests recommended...

310
00:10:06,035 --> 00:10:07,961
and eat at the restaurants for your missions.

311
00:10:08,135 --> 00:10:10,534
After each round, you can pay as much as you want...

312
00:10:10,535 --> 00:10:13,004
for the bill the staff has set for you.

313
00:10:13,005 --> 00:10:14,962
And you will pay in secret.

314
00:10:15,305 --> 00:10:18,128
If the final amount isn't enough for the bill after everyone's turn,

315
00:10:18,344 --> 00:10:19,973
the last member to pay and the member who paid the least...

316
00:10:19,974 --> 00:10:21,544
the last member to pay and the member who paid the least...

317
00:10:21,545 --> 00:10:24,234
- will split the remaining amount. - My gosh.

318
00:10:24,285 --> 00:10:25,414
We have to be smart about this.

319
00:10:25,415 --> 00:10:26,654
- We can't pay too little. - I have to be in the middle.

320
00:10:26,655 --> 00:10:27,953
By the way, this will be hard.

321
00:10:27,954 --> 00:10:29,924
- We have to be in the middle. - We can't be too petty.

322
00:10:29,925 --> 00:10:31,754
If the final amount is more than the bill,

323
00:10:31,755 --> 00:10:33,154
the member who paid the most...

324
00:10:33,155 --> 00:10:35,875
will take the leftover money.

325
00:10:36,025 --> 00:10:37,124
The member who paid the most?

326
00:10:37,125 --> 00:10:38,294
This is another rule.

327
00:10:38,295 --> 00:10:39,733
Doesn't it mean whoever pays the most has the advantage?

328
00:10:39,734 --> 00:10:41,534
- This is confusing. - It's confusing.

329
00:10:41,535 --> 00:10:43,504
After the race, the member with the most amount of money left...

330
00:10:43,505 --> 00:10:44,947
in R Pay will win.

331
00:10:45,234 --> 00:10:47,404
The winner will receive a penalty exemption ticket.

332
00:10:47,405 --> 00:10:50,331
The member with the least amount of money in R Pay...

333
00:10:50,545 --> 00:10:52,414
will choose a member to carry out a penalty.

334
00:10:52,415 --> 00:10:54,313
They will face the water bomb.

335
00:10:54,314 --> 00:10:55,683
- The water bomb. - No matter how well you play,

336
00:10:55,684 --> 00:10:57,126
some people will face the penalty.

337
00:10:57,145 --> 00:10:58,754
- Iron Min. If you do this, - Exactly.

338
00:10:58,755 --> 00:11:00,583
Seok Jin, Kwang Soo, and I will...

339
00:11:00,584 --> 00:11:02,183
- probably get the penalty. - Kwang Soo.

340
00:11:02,184 --> 00:11:04,215
If you win the race, you will be exempted from this.

341
00:11:04,255 --> 00:11:06,124
That's the hard thing to do.

342
00:11:06,125 --> 00:11:08,123
- It's usually Jong Kook. - Goodness.

343
00:11:08,265 --> 00:11:09,924
Even if I'm not in last place, when these members lose,

344
00:11:09,925 --> 00:11:11,764
they always choose me.

345
00:11:11,765 --> 00:11:13,363
There's this strange attraction.

346
00:11:13,364 --> 00:11:14,933
(Jae Seok, potential member to face the penalty)

347
00:11:14,934 --> 00:11:17,103
- Goodness. - However, during the race,

348
00:11:17,104 --> 00:11:19,004
members who spend all of their money...

349
00:11:19,005 --> 00:11:20,755
will face the penalty by default.

350
00:11:20,775 --> 00:11:22,374
And they cannot pick another member for the penalty.

351
00:11:22,375 --> 00:11:23,573
(On top of that, they can't pick a member.)

352
00:11:23,574 --> 00:11:24,943
I'm getting a headache.

353
00:11:24,944 --> 00:11:27,683
- Headache? - Gosh, I need some acetaminophen.

354
00:11:27,684 --> 00:11:28,713
What?

355
00:11:28,714 --> 00:11:30,784
(He suddenly mentions acetaminophen.)

356
00:11:30,785 --> 00:11:32,299
- What is that? - Acetaminophen.

357
00:11:32,385 --> 00:11:34,650
- Is that a headache medicine? - It's one of the components.

358
00:11:35,084 --> 00:11:36,258
- You memorize that? - Acetaminophen...

359
00:11:36,324 --> 00:11:38,179
- You memorize that? - Why?

360
00:11:38,425 --> 00:11:41,382
- Why would you? - This isn't a health-related show.

361
00:11:41,425 --> 00:11:43,264
- Why would you? - It's not something complicated.

362
00:11:43,265 --> 00:11:45,463
You guys don't know what it is.

363
00:11:45,464 --> 00:11:46,933
I doubt many people know what it is.

364
00:11:46,934 --> 00:11:48,304
I seriously doubt that.

365
00:11:48,305 --> 00:11:50,534
Isn't acetone enough?

366
00:11:50,535 --> 00:11:52,473
- Nail polish remover? - Right.

367
00:11:52,474 --> 00:11:54,304
That's all that we need to know in life.

368
00:11:54,305 --> 00:11:55,703
- Nail polish remover. - Acetaminophen is unnecessary.

369
00:11:55,704 --> 00:11:57,943
I will reveal three tasty restaurants...

370
00:11:57,944 --> 00:11:59,727
that will serve you invigorating dishes.

371
00:11:59,745 --> 00:12:01,183
Here they are.

372
00:12:01,184 --> 00:12:02,983
We will go to all three of them.

373
00:12:02,984 --> 00:12:04,384
(Invigorating Food of Alley Restaurants)

374
00:12:04,385 --> 00:12:05,486
Goodness.

375
00:12:05,755 --> 00:12:07,483
- What is that? - It means "clams and ribs".

376
00:12:07,484 --> 00:12:08,483
I choose that one.

377
00:12:08,484 --> 00:12:09,853
- Clams and ribs? - Yes.

378
00:12:09,854 --> 00:12:11,323
Lobster, clams, and ribs.

379
00:12:11,324 --> 00:12:13,593
(It's a collaboration between ocean meat and land meat.)

380
00:12:13,594 --> 00:12:14,924
What is "beef steamed in hinoki cypress box"?

381
00:12:14,925 --> 00:12:16,718
- Beef is in a hinoki cypress box. - It's in a hinoki cypress box.

382
00:12:17,265 --> 00:12:18,333
- They put it inside. - You've tried it.

383
00:12:18,334 --> 00:12:19,833
- It must be fragrant. - It's nice.

384
00:12:19,834 --> 00:12:21,586
- All right. - I choose that one.

385
00:12:22,604 --> 00:12:24,534
There's also boiled chicken with neungi mushrooms.

386
00:12:24,535 --> 00:12:26,431
That one looks tasty.

387
00:12:26,535 --> 00:12:27,884
Neungi mushrooms.

388
00:12:28,104 --> 00:12:29,874
In Ah, which one do you like the most?

389
00:12:29,875 --> 00:12:31,843
I eat boiled chicken with neungi mushrooms often.

390
00:12:31,844 --> 00:12:33,313
- I see. - Actually, I had that...

391
00:12:33,314 --> 00:12:35,843
- with my grandparents yesterday. - Really?

392
00:12:35,844 --> 00:12:37,683
Seriously? You brought your grandparents?

393
00:12:37,684 --> 00:12:38,818
She's a great daughter.

394
00:12:38,854 --> 00:12:40,554
They loved it.

395
00:12:40,555 --> 00:12:43,024
- I bet Seok Jin will too. - Right.

396
00:12:43,025 --> 00:12:45,254
(I bet Seok Jin will like it just like my grandparents did.)

397
00:12:45,255 --> 00:12:46,737
Why are you mentioning me?

398
00:12:46,925 --> 00:12:48,093
That's right.

399
00:12:48,094 --> 00:12:49,463
I'm not a grandpa.

400
00:12:49,464 --> 00:12:51,233
He'll love it.

401
00:12:51,234 --> 00:12:53,223
I don't like stuff like that.

402
00:12:54,064 --> 00:12:56,664
- I like dishes like pasta. - Stop.

403
00:12:56,665 --> 00:12:58,833
- I like risottos too. - You get indigestion.

404
00:12:58,834 --> 00:13:00,973
I like Italian cuisine such as risotto and pasta.

405
00:13:00,974 --> 00:13:02,504
- Nurungji risotto. - You should eat that.

406
00:13:02,505 --> 00:13:04,121
- It's better for your digestion. - Right.

407
00:13:04,245 --> 00:13:05,544
Come on, Jee Stream.

408
00:13:05,545 --> 00:13:08,244
- His theme song has changed. - Really?

409
00:13:08,245 --> 00:13:09,644
It's no longer Park Jin Young's song.

410
00:13:09,645 --> 00:13:11,853
- It's a new song. - He went through the most changes.

411
00:13:11,854 --> 00:13:13,853
- He has many charms. - You're unique.

412
00:13:13,854 --> 00:13:15,483
Jee Stream is really something else.

413
00:13:15,484 --> 00:13:16,853
Jee Stream is a cute nickname.

414
00:13:16,854 --> 00:13:18,723
But when you made...

415
00:13:18,724 --> 00:13:21,264
that trickling sound, that was a bit too much.

416
00:13:21,265 --> 00:13:22,794
- Gosh. - The trickling sound.

417
00:13:22,795 --> 00:13:23,994
The trickling sound.

418
00:13:23,995 --> 00:13:25,534
- Am I an IV drop? - No.

419
00:13:25,535 --> 00:13:27,333
He's an IV drop. He's a dropping pipette.

420
00:13:27,334 --> 00:13:29,264
Jee Drop.

421
00:13:29,265 --> 00:13:30,542
Jee Drop?

422
00:13:30,564 --> 00:13:32,073
He has so many characters.

423
00:13:32,074 --> 00:13:33,269
Give me one, will you?

424
00:13:33,734 --> 00:13:35,940
Bed-Wetting Jee, Jee Stream, Jee Drop.

425
00:13:36,604 --> 00:13:39,113
He has so many nicknames related to peeing.

426
00:13:39,114 --> 00:13:41,514
- Shall we take our bags? - Okay.

427
00:13:41,515 --> 00:13:43,987
We'll gather again after you change.

428
00:13:44,885 --> 00:13:46,414
The weather is great.

429
00:13:46,415 --> 00:13:47,692
Let's go eat.

430
00:13:48,025 --> 00:13:49,983
Goodness.

431
00:13:49,984 --> 00:13:51,223
If we surpass the price,

432
00:13:51,224 --> 00:13:52,424
the first place will take the remainder?

433
00:13:52,425 --> 00:13:54,664
- Just listen to your conscience. - Right.

434
00:13:54,665 --> 00:13:56,593
- Paying enough is crucial. - Right.

435
00:13:56,594 --> 00:13:58,093
While we're busy fighting about it,

436
00:13:58,094 --> 00:14:00,534
- Jong Kook might win. - You're right.

437
00:14:00,535 --> 00:14:02,404
- That's right. - I'm going to pay enough.

438
00:14:02,405 --> 00:14:03,634
I bet he will.

439
00:14:03,635 --> 00:14:05,374
Jong Kook has changed these days.

440
00:14:05,375 --> 00:14:06,848
I'll pay what's due.

441
00:14:07,405 --> 00:14:09,404
He's a bit crafty now.

442
00:14:09,405 --> 00:14:12,213
(He's a bit crafty now.)

443
00:14:12,214 --> 00:14:13,943
- What do you mean? - He's a bit crafty now.

444
00:14:13,944 --> 00:14:15,813
- Me? - Yes.

445
00:14:15,814 --> 00:14:18,284
Not at all. It doesn't suit me.

446
00:14:18,285 --> 00:14:20,254
There's something I need to correct.

447
00:14:20,255 --> 00:14:22,083
"Drop" is not the correct.

448
00:14:22,084 --> 00:14:23,624
- It should be "IV drop". - "IV drop"?

449
00:14:23,625 --> 00:14:25,201
So he will be Jee IV Drop.

450
00:14:25,655 --> 00:14:27,193
(His nickname is changed.)

451
00:14:27,194 --> 00:14:29,063
- It's much better. - It's changed.

452
00:14:29,064 --> 00:14:31,433
- Jee IV Drop is... - It sounds weird.

453
00:14:31,434 --> 00:14:33,863
- But we need to be exact. - Okay.

454
00:14:33,864 --> 00:14:35,203
Call me Jee the IV Drop.

455
00:14:35,204 --> 00:14:37,193
- It's like that LA Dodgers player. - Jee IV Drop.

456
00:14:37,204 --> 00:14:38,473
Doesn't it?

457
00:14:38,474 --> 00:14:40,233
Isn't his name Cody Bellinger?

458
00:14:40,234 --> 00:14:42,404
- Yes. - Cody IV Drop.

459
00:14:42,405 --> 00:14:44,203
- That's nice. - It's perfect.

460
00:14:44,204 --> 00:14:47,542
- Cody IV Drop. - It sounds so wrong.

461
00:14:47,915 --> 00:14:51,180
(We hope you become healthy once again.)

462
00:14:51,885 --> 00:14:53,713
Chungha, what's your real name?

463
00:14:53,714 --> 00:14:54,884
- What? - What's your real name?

464
00:14:54,885 --> 00:14:56,924
- It's Chan Mi. - Chan Mi?

465
00:14:56,925 --> 00:14:58,554
- Yes. - That's a pretty name.

466
00:14:58,555 --> 00:15:00,054
It's pretty.

467
00:15:00,055 --> 00:15:01,823
In Ah isn't your real name either.

468
00:15:01,824 --> 00:15:04,093
Yes, I have a nice name. It's Bang Ye Rin.

469
00:15:04,094 --> 00:15:05,363
You're a Bang?

470
00:15:05,364 --> 00:15:06,593
Yes, I am.

471
00:15:06,594 --> 00:15:08,103
- The surnames are different. - Her English name...

472
00:15:08,104 --> 00:15:09,649
is more popular.

473
00:15:09,765 --> 00:15:11,274
What is it?

474
00:15:11,275 --> 00:15:12,874
- It sounds like Seol In Ah. - Right.

475
00:15:12,875 --> 00:15:14,304
- It's Serena. - It's Serena.

476
00:15:14,305 --> 00:15:16,174
- It's Serena. - Oh, Serena.

477
00:15:16,175 --> 00:15:17,504
- Serena. - Serena.

478
00:15:17,505 --> 00:15:18,943
- Serena. - How about you?

479
00:15:18,944 --> 00:15:21,083
- It's Annie. - Annie.

480
00:15:21,084 --> 00:15:22,795
- Annie. - Annie Kim.

481
00:15:23,184 --> 00:15:24,514
- I haven't heard that in a while. - I'm Alex.

482
00:15:24,515 --> 00:15:25,983
(Hi, Annie. My name is Alex.)

483
00:15:25,984 --> 00:15:27,554
- Hi, Alex. - Yes, I'm Alex.

484
00:15:27,555 --> 00:15:29,203
- Don't be silly. - I'm Alex.

485
00:15:29,324 --> 00:15:31,622
You already have an English name.

486
00:15:31,755 --> 00:15:33,783
- Cody. - You're Cody IV Drop.

487
00:15:34,324 --> 00:15:36,223
- It's Alex. - You're Cody IV Drop.

488
00:15:36,224 --> 00:15:38,863
- I'm Alex when I go abroad. - That's ridiculous.

489
00:15:38,864 --> 00:15:40,063
Cody IV Drop.

490
00:15:40,064 --> 00:15:42,164
- My gosh. - You already have a name.

491
00:15:42,165 --> 00:15:43,606
I'm Alex.

492
00:15:44,234 --> 00:15:46,304
- It's a nice name. - It sounds sophisticated.

493
00:15:46,305 --> 00:15:47,572
Not at all.

494
00:15:47,635 --> 00:15:49,144
Do you have an English name?

495
00:15:49,145 --> 00:15:50,603
- Yes, I do. - Even Lia Kim has one.

496
00:15:50,604 --> 00:15:51,843
- Perry. - They all had one.

497
00:15:51,844 --> 00:15:53,081
- Right. - "Perry"?

498
00:15:53,375 --> 00:15:56,126
- The sparkling water? - No, just Perry.

499
00:15:56,245 --> 00:15:58,313
- He has an English name. - You do?

500
00:15:58,314 --> 00:15:59,583
- Yes. - Tell me.

501
00:15:59,584 --> 00:16:00,813
- Perry. - Why?

502
00:16:00,814 --> 00:16:02,608
- Why is it Perry? - Dung Perry?

503
00:16:02,854 --> 00:16:04,624
- Dung Perry? - Dung Perry?

504
00:16:04,625 --> 00:16:06,924
(How dare he call the Prince of Asia Dung Perry?)

505
00:16:06,925 --> 00:16:08,542
- Dung Perry. - Jong Kook knows.

506
00:16:08,864 --> 00:16:10,593
- It's true, right? - Yes, it is.

507
00:16:10,594 --> 00:16:12,063
But Jae Seok called me Dung Perry!

508
00:16:12,064 --> 00:16:13,294
My gosh.

509
00:16:13,295 --> 00:16:15,664
- He says I'm Dung Perry. - "Dung Perry".

510
00:16:15,665 --> 00:16:17,534
- I'm seriously Perry. - You're Dung Perry.

511
00:16:17,535 --> 00:16:18,774
Come on.

512
00:16:18,775 --> 00:16:20,896
You pretended to look cool in front of me.

513
00:16:20,974 --> 00:16:23,137
Cody IV Drop and Dung Perry.

514
00:16:24,204 --> 00:16:26,101
Haha loves it.

515
00:16:26,645 --> 00:16:29,213
- It's perfect. - Cody IV Drop and Dung Perry.

516
00:16:29,214 --> 00:16:30,343
Dung Perry.

517
00:16:30,344 --> 00:16:31,416
Cody IV Drop.

518
00:16:31,454 --> 00:16:32,914
Dung Perry was a shock.

519
00:16:32,915 --> 00:16:34,054
What about you?

520
00:16:34,055 --> 00:16:35,908
I have one already. It's Sebastian.

521
00:16:36,625 --> 00:16:38,345
- It suits you! - I'm Sebastian.

522
00:16:38,354 --> 00:16:40,024
I'm Sebastian.

523
00:16:40,025 --> 00:16:41,823
- Your name is in it. - Your name is a part of it.

524
00:16:41,824 --> 00:16:42,994
My gosh.

525
00:16:42,995 --> 00:16:44,463
- It's the perfect name for me. - You're right.

526
00:16:44,464 --> 00:16:45,534
Sebastian.

527
00:16:45,535 --> 00:16:47,491
- Dung Perry was nice. - That was hilarious.

528
00:16:47,765 --> 00:16:49,144
I'm jealous.

529
00:16:50,535 --> 00:16:51,534
(They arrive at a restaurant in Mapo-gu.)

530
00:16:51,535 --> 00:16:52,976
This place looks delicious.

531
00:16:54,974 --> 00:16:56,304
- What? - What?

532
00:16:56,305 --> 00:16:57,603
(They spot something.)

533
00:16:57,604 --> 00:16:59,573
Is there food on the table? What is that?

534
00:17:00,145 --> 00:17:01,483
- What is that? - It's amazing.

535
00:17:01,484 --> 00:17:02,544
(Lobster, clams, and braised short ribs)

536
00:17:02,545 --> 00:17:05,501
- Look at that lobster. - It looks jaw-dropping.

537
00:17:05,814 --> 00:17:07,742
There are many abalones.

538
00:17:08,455 --> 00:17:10,224
- It looks good. - This is what we're eating?

539
00:17:10,225 --> 00:17:12,294
- There's octopus too. - I want this so badly.

540
00:17:12,295 --> 00:17:15,355
- Let's sit down. - This is amazing.

541
00:17:15,394 --> 00:17:17,724
Annie and Serena, sit down.

542
00:17:17,725 --> 00:17:19,063
Annie and Serena.

543
00:17:19,064 --> 00:17:21,785
- Dung Perry. - Dung Perry.

544
00:17:22,035 --> 00:17:23,234
Dung Perry.

545
00:17:23,235 --> 00:17:24,986
- Sophie. - Sophie.

546
00:17:25,235 --> 00:17:26,882
It's actually "pee" not "phie".

547
00:17:27,035 --> 00:17:28,343
"Sopee".

548
00:17:29,245 --> 00:17:32,544
If you win, you'll get the food and the order of paying.

549
00:17:32,545 --> 00:17:34,514
It's called Water and Fire Quiz.

550
00:17:34,515 --> 00:17:36,113
(Water and Fire Quiz)

551
00:17:36,114 --> 00:17:38,653
You'll be split into teams of 2 and playing simultaneously.

552
00:17:38,654 --> 00:17:40,113
They'll be multiple-choice questions.

553
00:17:40,114 --> 00:17:42,866
The team that knows the answer must say, "answer".

554
00:17:42,924 --> 00:17:44,912
Afterwards, they'll come up front and make their choice.

555
00:17:44,995 --> 00:17:46,954
In five seconds, they must use a water gun...

556
00:17:46,955 --> 00:17:48,563
to fill their teammate's mouth.

557
00:17:48,564 --> 00:17:50,423
His or her teammates must extinguish...

558
00:17:50,424 --> 00:17:53,063
as many candles as the number of the multiple choice answer.

559
00:17:53,064 --> 00:17:54,434
(If the answer is number 5, they need to extinguish 5 candles.)

560
00:17:54,435 --> 00:17:57,234
(They need to collect the water in their mouths...)

561
00:17:57,235 --> 00:17:59,233
(and extinguish the candles.)

562
00:17:59,634 --> 00:18:01,427
What kind of game is this?

563
00:18:01,775 --> 00:18:03,603
- With the water in our mouths? - How?

564
00:18:03,604 --> 00:18:05,843
For example, if the answer is number three...

565
00:18:05,844 --> 00:18:07,113
My gosh.

566
00:18:07,114 --> 00:18:08,444
This is so hard.

567
00:18:08,445 --> 00:18:10,684
- I have a big mouth. - He does.

568
00:18:10,685 --> 00:18:11,954
You should collect the water.

569
00:18:11,955 --> 00:18:13,768
Having a lot of water in your mouth isn't necessarily good.

570
00:18:14,015 --> 00:18:15,498
Why is he picking on me today?

571
00:18:16,725 --> 00:18:18,712
- Why? - Dung Perry,

572
00:18:18,795 --> 00:18:20,299
it's not necessarily good, okay?

573
00:18:20,695 --> 00:18:21,923
You'll be partnering up.

574
00:18:21,924 --> 00:18:24,363
If you get it right, you'll both receive a dollar each.

575
00:18:24,364 --> 00:18:25,434
Really?

576
00:18:25,435 --> 00:18:27,934
If you get it wrong or fail to extinguish the candles,

577
00:18:27,935 --> 00:18:29,891
a dollar will be deducted from both of you.

578
00:18:30,205 --> 00:18:31,474
We'll lose money.

579
00:18:31,475 --> 00:18:32,833
- We get deducted. - Yes.

580
00:18:32,834 --> 00:18:33,934
- There are three questions. - Okay.

581
00:18:33,935 --> 00:18:36,474
Only those who get it right may eat.

582
00:18:36,475 --> 00:18:38,194
I bet Jae Seok will win.

583
00:18:38,775 --> 00:18:39,974
One member of the team...

584
00:18:39,975 --> 00:18:41,143
that has the least amount of money...

585
00:18:41,144 --> 00:18:44,244
- will be the last one to pay. - Only one person?

586
00:18:44,245 --> 00:18:45,813
- I told you that the one... - One person?

587
00:18:45,814 --> 00:18:47,184
who paid the least and the last...

588
00:18:47,185 --> 00:18:49,883
- would split the bill, right? - Yes.

589
00:18:49,884 --> 00:18:51,781
I hope I don't partner up with Se Chan.

590
00:18:51,924 --> 00:18:54,160
If you become my partner, we're going to lose.

591
00:18:54,624 --> 00:18:55,623
(Here)

592
00:18:55,624 --> 00:18:57,224
What? Hey.

593
00:18:57,225 --> 00:18:59,863
(Just take this spoon.)

594
00:18:59,864 --> 00:19:01,534
What are you doing?

595
00:19:01,535 --> 00:19:02,764
You just handed him a spoon.

596
00:19:02,765 --> 00:19:03,964
You don't know how this works.

597
00:19:03,965 --> 00:19:05,273
He just handed it to him.

598
00:19:05,604 --> 00:19:07,458
The yellow looks good on you.

599
00:19:08,074 --> 00:19:09,204
My gosh.

600
00:19:09,205 --> 00:19:10,718
You don't know who your partner is.

601
00:19:10,745 --> 00:19:13,044
Mix them up. Make it interesting.

602
00:19:13,045 --> 00:19:14,444
I should be anticipating.

603
00:19:14,445 --> 00:19:16,133
I want to feel anxious.

604
00:19:16,644 --> 00:19:17,954
Okay.

605
00:19:17,955 --> 00:19:19,396
(After mixing the spoons, he hands him one.)

606
00:19:20,255 --> 00:19:21,665
How did you do it?

607
00:19:23,055 --> 00:19:24,284
- It must be the same one. - Let's do it again.

608
00:19:24,285 --> 00:19:26,224
- It's the same one. - How?

609
00:19:26,225 --> 00:19:28,764
- Hey. - He's good.

610
00:19:28,765 --> 00:19:30,269
He has quick fingers.

611
00:19:30,795 --> 00:19:32,794
- Hey, mix them up. - Fine.

612
00:19:33,164 --> 00:19:35,804
- Someone else can pick first. - All right.

613
00:19:35,805 --> 00:19:36,863
(They pick out their spoons fair and square.)

614
00:19:36,864 --> 00:19:38,073
I got white.

615
00:19:38,074 --> 00:19:39,650
- Okay. - Okay! Great.

616
00:19:40,134 --> 00:19:41,648
All right.

617
00:19:41,874 --> 00:19:44,613
If you know the answer, tell us.

618
00:19:44,614 --> 00:19:46,714
- Okay. - Then you can extinguish the fire.

619
00:19:46,715 --> 00:19:48,908
Here is the first question.

620
00:19:49,015 --> 00:19:52,514
Which of these choices is not mentioned by Jeong Yakyong...

621
00:19:52,515 --> 00:19:54,984
- In Namyangju... - as a way to spend the summer...

622
00:19:54,985 --> 00:19:58,524
according to his book "Eight Tips on How to Spend the Summer"?

623
00:19:58,525 --> 00:20:00,994
- This is hard. - It is.

624
00:20:00,995 --> 00:20:04,524
Number one, shooting arrows in a pine tree forest.

625
00:20:04,525 --> 00:20:07,434
Number two, swinging under a zelkova tree.

626
00:20:07,435 --> 00:20:10,934
Number three, playing pitch-pot alone at an empty gazebo.

627
00:20:10,935 --> 00:20:13,873
Number four, eating hot food.

628
00:20:13,874 --> 00:20:16,843
Number five, listening to the sounds of cicadas in a forest in the east.

629
00:20:16,844 --> 00:20:19,113
Number six, playing baduk on a bamboo mat.

630
00:20:19,114 --> 00:20:20,643
- Answer. - We said it first.

631
00:20:20,644 --> 00:20:21,643
Kwang Soo.

632
00:20:21,644 --> 00:20:23,747
(Kwang Soo and Ji Hyo get a chance to answer.)

633
00:20:23,844 --> 00:20:26,152
- Do this. - Okay.

634
00:20:26,414 --> 00:20:28,134
- What's your answer? - We choose...

635
00:20:29,225 --> 00:20:30,554
- Number 2! - Number 2?

636
00:20:30,555 --> 00:20:31,862
- I think that's right. - Which is?

637
00:20:32,124 --> 00:20:33,598
- What? - What is it?

638
00:20:34,394 --> 00:20:35,893
(They don't know.)

639
00:20:35,894 --> 00:20:36,994
- Number one. - Come out.

640
00:20:36,995 --> 00:20:38,231
- Which is? - Number one.

641
00:20:38,795 --> 00:20:41,618
- Pitching under a pine tree. - Under the pine tree...

642
00:20:41,705 --> 00:20:43,105
Come out.

643
00:20:43,334 --> 00:20:44,804
They don't remember it.

644
00:20:44,805 --> 00:20:46,373
A dollar has been deducted.

645
00:20:46,374 --> 00:20:47,633
- Answer! - Okay.

646
00:20:47,634 --> 00:20:49,736
- Which one is it? - Number three.

647
00:20:49,904 --> 00:20:51,544
Should I do it?

648
00:20:51,545 --> 00:20:52,974
- And what is it? - Which is?

649
00:20:52,975 --> 00:20:54,514
Playing pitch-pot alone at an empty gazebo.

650
00:20:54,515 --> 00:20:55,647
Okay.

651
00:20:55,745 --> 00:20:57,944
- What should I do? - Do it slowly.

652
00:20:57,945 --> 00:20:59,841
From this far away?

653
00:21:00,015 --> 00:21:02,044
Isn't this too far?

654
00:21:02,824 --> 00:21:04,794
Get ready. You're given five seconds.

655
00:21:04,795 --> 00:21:06,153
Ready, set, go.

656
00:21:06,154 --> 00:21:08,153
(She shoots the gun.)

657
00:21:08,664 --> 00:21:10,563
(In Ah is drenched from the start.)

658
00:21:10,564 --> 00:21:12,964
- Serena! - She has a big mouth.

659
00:21:12,965 --> 00:21:14,294
- 1, 2, 3. - My gosh.

660
00:21:14,295 --> 00:21:16,534
Why do you have such a big mouth?

661
00:21:16,535 --> 00:21:18,704
- Three candles. - She has a lot of water.

662
00:21:18,705 --> 00:21:19,833
(She needs to extinguish 3 candles.)

663
00:21:19,834 --> 00:21:22,173
(Will she be able to do it?)

664
00:21:22,174 --> 00:21:24,274
She has a lot of water.

665
00:21:24,275 --> 00:21:25,448
(She spits it out.)

666
00:21:27,015 --> 00:21:28,813
(However, she doesn't extinguish any of them.)

667
00:21:28,814 --> 00:21:30,083
- That was close. - Answer.

668
00:21:30,084 --> 00:21:31,284
- Answer. - Answer.

669
00:21:31,285 --> 00:21:32,714
- Are you okay? - Yes.

670
00:21:32,715 --> 00:21:34,454
It's not easy.

671
00:21:34,455 --> 00:21:35,883
(Kwang Soo and Ji Hyo try again.)

672
00:21:35,884 --> 00:21:36,955
Number three.

673
00:21:37,255 --> 00:21:39,054
Pitching in an empty gazebo.

674
00:21:39,055 --> 00:21:40,497
(She's confident.)

675
00:21:40,894 --> 00:21:41,923
- Pitching? - Pitching?

676
00:21:41,924 --> 00:21:43,194
What are you doing?

677
00:21:43,195 --> 00:21:44,503
Come on!

678
00:21:44,564 --> 00:21:47,234
(He explodes.)

679
00:21:47,235 --> 00:21:48,304
(She's embarrassed.)

680
00:21:48,305 --> 00:21:49,704
- We got it wrong last time. - This is hilarious.

681
00:21:49,705 --> 00:21:52,311
Are you talking about a helmet?

682
00:21:52,505 --> 00:21:53,603
What are you doing?

683
00:21:53,604 --> 00:21:54,943
Can we please play the game?

684
00:21:55,005 --> 00:21:57,403
You said that before.

685
00:21:57,404 --> 00:21:58,444
I was in a hurry.

686
00:21:58,445 --> 00:22:00,613
- That's the wrong answer. - Okay.

687
00:22:00,614 --> 00:22:02,544
- I was in a hurry. - Come on.

688
00:22:02,545 --> 00:22:04,613
How could you say that we were wrong right away?

689
00:22:04,614 --> 00:22:06,313
- The answer is number 3. - Number 3.

690
00:22:06,314 --> 00:22:08,798
Playing pitch-pot alone at an empty gazebo.

691
00:22:09,324 --> 00:22:10,623
(He's focused.)

692
00:22:10,624 --> 00:22:11,794
I'll start from... I'm sorry.

693
00:22:11,795 --> 00:22:13,454
- Hey. - I'm sorry!

694
00:22:13,455 --> 00:22:15,294
(He accidentally shoots...)

695
00:22:15,295 --> 00:22:17,423
(at Jong Kook's pants.)

696
00:22:17,424 --> 00:22:18,494
I'm sorry!

697
00:22:18,495 --> 00:22:20,234
(He makes a mistake.)

698
00:22:20,235 --> 00:22:21,804
- I'm sorry. I didn't mean it. - That was intentional.

699
00:22:21,805 --> 00:22:23,264
- That was, right? - I miscalculated.

700
00:22:23,265 --> 00:22:25,190
Hey, don't do that.

701
00:22:26,005 --> 00:22:27,333
Hold on.

702
00:22:27,334 --> 00:22:29,544
It's embarrassing to watch. Can you lower your shirt more?

703
00:22:29,545 --> 00:22:31,605
(It's embarrassing to watch. Can you lower your shirt more?)

704
00:22:31,975 --> 00:22:33,173
Hey!

705
00:22:33,174 --> 00:22:34,762
- You jerk! - I mean...

706
00:22:34,814 --> 00:22:36,514
- What have you done? - I didn't know.

707
00:22:36,515 --> 00:22:37,984
I didn't know that would happen.

708
00:22:37,985 --> 00:22:40,514
- Just wet all around it. - Wet all around it.

709
00:22:40,515 --> 00:22:42,684
- Do that. - Okay, mind your own business.

710
00:22:42,685 --> 00:22:44,083
- Jong Kook. - Mind your own business.

711
00:22:44,084 --> 00:22:46,084
- Use this to dry it. - Hey!

712
00:22:46,195 --> 00:22:48,388
(Use this fire.)

713
00:22:49,124 --> 00:22:50,815
- Use this. - It'll burn it!

714
00:22:51,465 --> 00:22:53,264
- It'll burn it! - My gosh, So Min.

715
00:22:53,265 --> 00:22:54,494
What if my pants burn?

716
00:22:54,495 --> 00:22:56,034
Don't do that!

717
00:22:56,035 --> 00:22:57,403
They shouldn't burn.

718
00:22:57,404 --> 00:22:58,804
It'll burn the pants, not dry them.

719
00:22:58,805 --> 00:22:59,804
Ready,

720
00:22:59,805 --> 00:23:01,234
- set, go. - Goodness.

721
00:23:01,235 --> 00:23:02,543
(Spraying)

722
00:23:02,604 --> 00:23:03,634
Oh, no!

723
00:23:04,005 --> 00:23:05,113
They're stable.

724
00:23:05,114 --> 00:23:06,244
They're good.

725
00:23:06,245 --> 00:23:07,714
(Now, he needs to extinguish 3 candles.)

726
00:23:07,715 --> 00:23:09,023
You shot his nose intentionally, right?

727
00:23:09,844 --> 00:23:12,019
Extinguish them one by one.

728
00:23:13,015 --> 00:23:14,514
(Suddenly,)

729
00:23:14,515 --> 00:23:16,054
- Two of them got extinguished. - Hold on.

730
00:23:16,055 --> 00:23:18,623
(2 of the candles are extinguished.)

731
00:23:18,624 --> 00:23:20,788
- They're extinguished. - What?

732
00:23:20,824 --> 00:23:21,823
Nice!

733
00:23:21,824 --> 00:23:23,617
I did that.

734
00:23:23,924 --> 00:23:25,434
- You just need to extinguish one. - That's right.

735
00:23:25,435 --> 00:23:26,434
Aim.

736
00:23:26,435 --> 00:23:29,216
(If he extinguishes more than one, they'll fail.)

737
00:23:29,965 --> 00:23:31,758
- Aim. - Aim.

738
00:23:31,805 --> 00:23:33,603
(What?)

739
00:23:33,604 --> 00:23:34,634
Aim.

740
00:23:35,005 --> 00:23:36,603
- A bit more. - What is that?

741
00:23:36,604 --> 00:23:37,903
- My gosh. - What is that?

742
00:23:37,904 --> 00:23:40,714
- What is that? - He did it!

743
00:23:40,715 --> 00:23:42,980
(He's a human water gun.)

744
00:23:43,185 --> 00:23:44,586
(What is that?)

745
00:23:44,955 --> 00:23:47,634
(He extinguishes 3 candles.)

746
00:23:47,785 --> 00:23:49,284
My gosh, Jong Kook!

747
00:23:49,285 --> 00:23:50,315
(He makes anything possible.)

748
00:23:50,424 --> 00:23:53,194
(What is going on?)

749
00:23:53,195 --> 00:23:55,388
(Why does he have a water gun in his mouth?)

750
00:23:56,094 --> 00:23:58,433
How is this possible?

751
00:23:58,495 --> 00:24:00,393
- All right. - All right.

752
00:24:00,394 --> 00:24:02,775
You chose number three.

753
00:24:04,765 --> 00:24:06,279
Gosh, we're wrong.

754
00:24:06,535 --> 00:24:08,403
(It wasn't number 3.)

755
00:24:08,404 --> 00:24:10,538
What he did was so cool.

756
00:24:11,104 --> 00:24:12,413
It was amazing.

757
00:24:12,414 --> 00:24:14,073
I used to do that back in middle school.

758
00:24:14,074 --> 00:24:15,613
He used to be a gangster.

759
00:24:15,614 --> 00:24:17,613
- Answer! - Eating hot food.

760
00:24:17,614 --> 00:24:19,335
Number four.

761
00:24:19,555 --> 00:24:21,954
- Okay. You may start. - Serena and Annie.

762
00:24:22,285 --> 00:24:23,870
- Go. - Here I go.

763
00:24:24,354 --> 00:24:26,524
- Goodness. - Here I go.

764
00:24:26,525 --> 00:24:27,923
(Staggering)

765
00:24:27,924 --> 00:24:29,464
- It's really strong. - Hey.

766
00:24:29,465 --> 00:24:31,093
(She moisturizes her skin for her comeback.)

767
00:24:31,094 --> 00:24:33,948
Do you really have to do this to her when she's making a comeback?

768
00:24:34,265 --> 00:24:35,704
- She collected a lot of water. - She did.

769
00:24:35,705 --> 00:24:37,333
- Extinguish 4 candles. - 4 candles.

770
00:24:37,334 --> 00:24:38,642
- Four candles. - I don't know if she can do it.

771
00:24:40,005 --> 00:24:41,930
(Murmuring)

772
00:24:43,705 --> 00:24:46,631
(What? Did she get four of them?)

773
00:24:46,874 --> 00:24:49,444
(The candles catch fire again.)

774
00:24:49,445 --> 00:24:50,714
(She lacks power.)

775
00:24:50,715 --> 00:24:52,113
- Answer! - Answer!

776
00:24:52,114 --> 00:24:53,784
Answer! Number four!

777
00:24:53,785 --> 00:24:55,054
- Answer! - Answer!

778
00:24:55,055 --> 00:24:56,806
Answer! Number five!

779
00:24:56,924 --> 00:24:58,524
- Which is? - Eating hot food.

780
00:24:58,525 --> 00:25:00,307
(She claims number 5 is "eating hot food".)

781
00:25:00,924 --> 00:25:03,294
("Eating hot food" is number 4.)

782
00:25:03,295 --> 00:25:04,355
Answer!

783
00:25:06,295 --> 00:25:07,994
She just did that one!

784
00:25:07,995 --> 00:25:09,920
What's her deal?

785
00:25:10,164 --> 00:25:12,873
- What's wrong with you? - You said number five.

786
00:25:12,874 --> 00:25:14,774
- Come on. - You said it was number five.

787
00:25:14,775 --> 00:25:17,278
- It's number five. - Ji Hyo, you're hilarious.

788
00:25:17,445 --> 00:25:19,274
Kwang Soo's team hasn't had the chance to do it.

789
00:25:19,275 --> 00:25:21,026
I want to get wet too!

790
00:25:21,545 --> 00:25:23,130
- Hey. - Come on.

791
00:25:23,314 --> 00:25:24,613
You're so dry.

792
00:25:24,614 --> 00:25:26,284
We haven't had the chance.

793
00:25:26,285 --> 00:25:27,613
(I want to play with the water gun too.)

794
00:25:27,614 --> 00:25:28,623
(Kwang Soo and Ji Hyo attempt again.)

795
00:25:28,624 --> 00:25:30,123
- Answer! - Answer!

796
00:25:30,124 --> 00:25:32,390
- Number four! - Yes, Ji Hyo and Kwang Soo?

797
00:25:33,455 --> 00:25:34,694
- Which one? - You should answer.

798
00:25:34,695 --> 00:25:36,093
- Number 4. - Number 4.

799
00:25:36,094 --> 00:25:38,463
- Eating... - Eating... Hold on. I'm sorry.

800
00:25:39,765 --> 00:25:41,393
(He stops her from talking.)

801
00:25:41,394 --> 00:25:43,103
Eating hot food.

802
00:25:43,104 --> 00:25:44,163
- Okay. - Okay.

803
00:25:44,164 --> 00:25:46,133
- Finally. - It's his first try.

804
00:25:46,134 --> 00:25:47,173
I know.

805
00:25:47,174 --> 00:25:48,304
Finally.

806
00:25:48,305 --> 00:25:49,544
(This is what he's been waiting for.)

807
00:25:49,545 --> 00:25:51,460
(I'll aim well.)

808
00:25:51,604 --> 00:25:52,613
Go.

809
00:25:52,614 --> 00:25:53,873
(She begins shooting.)

810
00:25:53,874 --> 00:25:55,313
(What's going on?)

811
00:25:55,314 --> 00:25:56,313
Oh, no.

812
00:25:56,314 --> 00:25:57,551
(I'll help you.)

813
00:25:58,084 --> 00:26:00,413
(Is this how it works?)

814
00:26:00,414 --> 00:26:02,517
- Collect the water! - Oh, no!

815
00:26:02,785 --> 00:26:04,254
(The water pressure is remarkable.)

816
00:26:04,255 --> 00:26:07,140
- Look at him. - Don't swallow!

817
00:26:07,195 --> 00:26:08,976
- Look at him. - Don't swallow it!

818
00:26:09,424 --> 00:26:10,764
He swallowed it.

819
00:26:10,795 --> 00:26:12,546
Don't throw up.

820
00:26:12,664 --> 00:26:14,415
- He drank a lot. - He's Groot.

821
00:26:15,404 --> 00:26:17,259
- Go, Groot. - Do what Jong Kook did.

822
00:26:18,205 --> 00:26:21,090
(Is this the only way they can win?)

823
00:26:21,174 --> 00:26:22,854
(Wriggling)

824
00:26:24,104 --> 00:26:25,514
- He can't aim. - It's working.

825
00:26:25,515 --> 00:26:26,873
- He can't aim. - He can't.

826
00:26:26,874 --> 00:26:27,913
(The water goes everywhere.)

827
00:26:27,914 --> 00:26:28,913
(The candles are burning strong.)

828
00:26:28,914 --> 00:26:30,784
- Where is it coming from? - It's not working.

829
00:26:30,785 --> 00:26:32,153
- Why does it come out like this? - Answer!

830
00:26:32,154 --> 00:26:33,514
- How is that possible? - Answer!

831
00:26:33,515 --> 00:26:34,784
(The water avoids the candles.)

832
00:26:34,785 --> 00:26:35,784
Ji Hyo should do it.

833
00:26:35,785 --> 00:26:37,184
- Answer. - Answer.

834
00:26:37,185 --> 00:26:38,454
- Go first. - Eating...

835
00:26:38,455 --> 00:26:39,454
- Number 4. - Number 4.

836
00:26:39,455 --> 00:26:41,309
- Eating hot food. - Eating hot food.

837
00:26:41,455 --> 00:26:43,363
I don't even know if this is the right answer.

838
00:26:43,364 --> 00:26:45,663
- It could be wrong. - It could be.

839
00:26:45,664 --> 00:26:47,446
- Right. - I think...

840
00:26:47,535 --> 00:26:49,976
(Jong Kook is the shooter this time.)

841
00:26:50,705 --> 00:26:52,004
Look at that skill.

842
00:26:52,005 --> 00:26:54,581
You look like a catfish.

843
00:26:54,874 --> 00:26:56,673
(Se Chan's mouth is just the right fit for this game.)

844
00:26:56,674 --> 00:26:59,703
- Done? - He's a fresh water catfish.

845
00:27:00,015 --> 00:27:01,282
- Good. - I've seen a fish like that before.

846
00:27:01,785 --> 00:27:02,813
(He's going to aim for the last 2.)

847
00:27:02,814 --> 00:27:04,214
Left first? Good.

848
00:27:04,215 --> 00:27:07,615
Then the right? All right. I understood everything.

849
00:27:08,384 --> 00:27:09,423
(Spitting)

850
00:27:09,424 --> 00:27:11,134
(Did he get all 4?)

851
00:27:11,624 --> 00:27:13,623
(They reignite.)

852
00:27:13,624 --> 00:27:15,524
It's okay. Stay calm.

853
00:27:15,525 --> 00:27:16,904
- You're aiming too low. - Let's do it.

854
00:27:17,765 --> 00:27:18,764
Okay!

855
00:27:18,765 --> 00:27:20,721
(He extinguishes 2 of them.)

856
00:27:20,894 --> 00:27:22,333
(I still have more water.)

857
00:27:22,334 --> 00:27:24,964
Okay. Just repeat what you did.

858
00:27:24,965 --> 00:27:26,774
Do the same thing.

859
00:27:26,775 --> 00:27:28,248
(This is his 3rd attempt.)

860
00:27:28,404 --> 00:27:29,603
- There's more. - There is?

861
00:27:29,604 --> 00:27:31,149
- How much more does he have? - Good.

862
00:27:31,604 --> 00:27:34,294
Does your body produce water?

863
00:27:34,445 --> 00:27:36,856
- Good. Go stronger. - Does your body produce water?

864
00:27:37,445 --> 00:27:39,268
(What?)

865
00:27:39,515 --> 00:27:41,029
You did it!

866
00:27:41,455 --> 00:27:43,724
(He extinguishes 4 candles.)

867
00:27:43,725 --> 00:27:45,623
- I still have more left. - Let's see if this is right.

868
00:27:45,624 --> 00:27:48,194
- Let's find out. - You chose number four.

869
00:27:48,195 --> 00:27:49,194
Is it right?

870
00:27:49,195 --> 00:27:50,363
(They get it right.)

871
00:27:50,364 --> 00:27:51,863
Jong Kook!

872
00:27:51,864 --> 00:27:54,368
(It was the right answer.)

873
00:27:55,364 --> 00:27:57,776
(Their cooperation has become a success.)

874
00:27:58,904 --> 00:28:00,759
- Jong Kook. - We did it.

875
00:28:01,134 --> 00:28:02,175
Good job.

876
00:28:02,674 --> 00:28:04,544
- Okay. That was good. - Okay.

877
00:28:04,545 --> 00:28:06,813
Since it seems like this is too hard...

878
00:28:06,814 --> 00:28:08,913
- It is. - How about getting three of them?

879
00:28:08,914 --> 00:28:10,784
- Wouldn't that be easier? - Yes.

880
00:28:10,785 --> 00:28:12,284
- We'll do that. - Okay.

881
00:28:12,285 --> 00:28:14,054
The number you choose doesn't matter.

882
00:28:14,055 --> 00:28:17,224
As long as you get at least three candles, you can answer.

883
00:28:17,225 --> 00:28:18,284
- Okay. - We'll start.

884
00:28:18,285 --> 00:28:19,554
We must succeed.

885
00:28:19,555 --> 00:28:20,554
Next question.

886
00:28:20,555 --> 00:28:22,794
Yang Guifei was the beautiful consort of China.

887
00:28:22,795 --> 00:28:24,370
I've heard about her.

888
00:28:24,564 --> 00:28:28,201
She rolled this in her mouth to cool herself down.

889
00:28:28,235 --> 00:28:30,604
- What? - What was it?

890
00:28:30,805 --> 00:28:32,587
Number one, a Korean cherry.

891
00:28:32,805 --> 00:28:34,484
Number two, a pearl.

892
00:28:34,604 --> 00:28:36,427
Number three, a jade marble.

893
00:28:36,545 --> 00:28:38,574
Number four, a gold ring.

894
00:28:38,614 --> 00:28:40,113
Number five, a steel marble.

895
00:28:40,114 --> 00:28:41,714
Number six, a silver spoon.

896
00:28:41,715 --> 00:28:43,143
- Answer! - Answer!

897
00:28:43,144 --> 00:28:44,544
- Answer! - Seok Jin.

898
00:28:44,545 --> 00:28:46,646
- Go. - Number four, a gold ring.

899
00:28:47,715 --> 00:28:49,323
- Go on. - Let's do it.

900
00:28:49,324 --> 00:28:50,454
It's number one, a Korean cherry.

901
00:28:50,455 --> 00:28:51,485
Go on.

902
00:28:51,924 --> 00:28:55,224
It must be gold. It's harmless to consume too.

903
00:28:55,225 --> 00:28:58,163
If it's pure gold, wouldn't it bend inside your mouth?

904
00:28:58,164 --> 00:28:59,663
- What? - Wouldn't it bend?

905
00:28:59,664 --> 00:29:01,828
It's a gold ring.

906
00:29:02,265 --> 00:29:05,221
So what if it bends? It's okay.

907
00:29:05,505 --> 00:29:08,304
Seok Jin, you need to hurry! Open your mouth!

908
00:29:08,305 --> 00:29:09,335
(Panicking)

909
00:29:11,074 --> 00:29:12,343
(He extinguishes 5 candles.)

910
00:29:12,344 --> 00:29:13,405
Okay!

911
00:29:14,245 --> 00:29:15,813
- I hope it's right. - It needs to be.

912
00:29:15,814 --> 00:29:17,613
You chose number four, a gold ring.

913
00:29:17,614 --> 00:29:18,714
- Is it right? - Please.

914
00:29:18,715 --> 00:29:20,153
- Answer! - Answer!

915
00:29:20,154 --> 00:29:21,184
- Answer! - Answer!

916
00:29:21,185 --> 00:29:22,287
Ji Hyo.

917
00:29:22,985 --> 00:29:24,684
- Go. - It's...

918
00:29:24,685 --> 00:29:26,756
- Which one is it? - It's number one.

919
00:29:27,324 --> 00:29:28,704
- Number one? - A Korean cherry.

920
00:29:29,124 --> 00:29:30,264
- A Korean cherry. - It's a cherry.

921
00:29:30,265 --> 00:29:31,295
It's a cherry.

922
00:29:31,594 --> 00:29:33,063
- A cherry? - Yes, it is.

923
00:29:33,064 --> 00:29:34,163
It's a cherry.

924
00:29:34,164 --> 00:29:35,204
Let her be.

925
00:29:35,205 --> 00:29:36,903
- Let her answer. - What is it?

926
00:29:36,904 --> 00:29:38,534
You heard it, right? I didn't.

927
00:29:38,535 --> 00:29:40,388
- What's your answer? - It's a cherry, Ji Hyo.

928
00:29:40,775 --> 00:29:42,351
- It's a cherry. - It's a cherry.

929
00:29:42,505 --> 00:29:43,903
- Number one. - Okay.

930
00:29:43,904 --> 00:29:45,173
- What is it? - A cherry.

931
00:29:45,174 --> 00:29:46,792
I thought you knew.

932
00:29:47,074 --> 00:29:48,913
You said it was number one for sure.

933
00:29:48,914 --> 00:29:49,913
Number one?

934
00:29:49,914 --> 00:29:51,842
(Ji Hyo doesn't want to be ridiculed anymore.)

935
00:29:52,255 --> 00:29:53,316
A cherry?

936
00:29:53,884 --> 00:29:55,623
Answer! Answer!

937
00:29:55,624 --> 00:29:57,850
(She's fallen in their trap.)

938
00:29:58,324 --> 00:29:59,354
Answer!

939
00:29:59,924 --> 00:30:00,923
A Korean cherry.

940
00:30:00,924 --> 00:30:01,954
(He steals her answer.)

941
00:30:02,225 --> 00:30:04,093
- Which number? - Number one, a Korean cherry.

942
00:30:04,094 --> 00:30:06,694
- Number one, a Korean cherry. - It's a Korean cherry. I was right.

943
00:30:06,695 --> 00:30:07,863
I was right.

944
00:30:07,864 --> 00:30:09,903
- You're duped again. - Ji Hyo.

945
00:30:09,904 --> 00:30:11,584
- Ji Hyo, that's enough. - You're so gullible.

946
00:30:12,035 --> 00:30:14,549
I thought it'd be either a Korean cherry or a jade marble.

947
00:30:14,805 --> 00:30:15,875
It must be correct.

948
00:30:16,404 --> 00:30:19,711
(The two steal Ji Hyo's answer and finally get a chance.)

949
00:30:20,215 --> 00:30:21,244
Okay!

950
00:30:21,245 --> 00:30:22,377
He extinguished them all.

951
00:30:23,144 --> 00:30:25,083
Everyone is getting the hang of it.

952
00:30:25,084 --> 00:30:27,254
- Answer! - What?

953
00:30:27,255 --> 00:30:28,724
- We're wrong? - Answer!

954
00:30:28,725 --> 00:30:29,724
- Answer! - Answer!

955
00:30:29,725 --> 00:30:31,024
- Answer! - In Ah was quicker.

956
00:30:31,025 --> 00:30:32,086
In Ah.

957
00:30:32,924 --> 00:30:34,093
Should I say it?

958
00:30:34,094 --> 00:30:35,694
- Number five. - Which is?

959
00:30:35,695 --> 00:30:37,264
- Steel marble. - Okay, go on.

960
00:30:37,265 --> 00:30:38,363
- Let me do it. - She put that in her mouth?

961
00:30:38,364 --> 00:30:40,593
- It's not good for you. - It's not.

962
00:30:40,594 --> 00:30:41,663
(They choose the least popular answer.)

963
00:30:41,664 --> 00:30:43,063
This is really difficult.

964
00:30:43,064 --> 00:30:44,704
- Serena! - She did it.

965
00:30:44,705 --> 00:30:49,343
- She passed. - Okay.

966
00:30:49,344 --> 00:30:51,204
- What is the answer? - A steel marble.

967
00:30:51,205 --> 00:30:52,313
Number five, a steel marble.

968
00:30:52,314 --> 00:30:53,962
(I'm next.)

969
00:30:54,814 --> 00:30:56,566
(They get it right.)

970
00:30:57,644 --> 00:30:59,214
(Does that even make sense?)

971
00:30:59,215 --> 00:31:00,413
How does that even make sense?

972
00:31:00,414 --> 00:31:02,238
It's dangerous if you swallow.

973
00:31:02,455 --> 00:31:03,684
What if it rusts?

974
00:31:03,685 --> 00:31:04,883
(They acquire the meal card and a dollar each.)

975
00:31:04,884 --> 00:31:06,440
A steel marble?

976
00:31:06,455 --> 00:31:08,731
Every time someone said a number, Ji Hyo would whisper,

977
00:31:08,795 --> 00:31:09,855
"This is the answer."

978
00:31:10,364 --> 00:31:12,534
When another person answered, she'd say, "It's this one."

979
00:31:12,535 --> 00:31:14,034
(Ji Hyo kept telling him the wrong answer.)

980
00:31:14,035 --> 00:31:15,704
Why did you do that?

981
00:31:15,705 --> 00:31:17,434
They all seemed right.

982
00:31:17,435 --> 00:31:18,873
Here's the last question.

983
00:31:18,874 --> 00:31:20,173
- Okay. - We need to get it.

984
00:31:20,174 --> 00:31:21,204
We should!

985
00:31:21,205 --> 00:31:23,338
- Number 4, Hongcheon. - Number 4, Hongcheon.

986
00:31:24,305 --> 00:31:25,974
(Jae Seok and Haha say the correct answer...)

987
00:31:25,975 --> 00:31:27,643
(after an amazing water show.)

988
00:31:27,644 --> 00:31:30,777
(All questions have been answered.)

989
00:31:31,084 --> 00:31:33,969
The members who can have lunch are...

990
00:31:34,154 --> 00:31:35,319
Jae Seok, Haha,

991
00:31:35,985 --> 00:31:37,364
Chungha, Seol In Ah,

992
00:31:37,854 --> 00:31:39,441
Jong Kook, and Se Chan.

993
00:31:40,094 --> 00:31:41,454
You can have lunch.

994
00:31:41,455 --> 00:31:43,113
- Let's eat first. - Let's do that.

995
00:31:43,225 --> 00:31:44,398
The members at the bottom are...

996
00:31:44,594 --> 00:31:45,694
Kwang Soo and Ji Hyo.

997
00:31:45,695 --> 00:31:47,264
(Kwang Soo and Ji Hyo are at the bottom.)

998
00:31:47,265 --> 00:31:48,804
(Us?)

999
00:31:48,805 --> 00:31:49,863
(We didn't end up at the bottom.)

1000
00:31:49,864 --> 00:31:51,034
- We're not at the bottom. - One of them...

1001
00:31:51,035 --> 00:31:52,858
- will pay for lunch. - They lost a dollar every time.

1002
00:31:53,134 --> 00:31:54,205
But they didn't try...

1003
00:31:54,435 --> 00:31:57,643
more than a couple of times.

1004
00:31:57,644 --> 00:31:58,880
I mean...

1005
00:31:58,914 --> 00:32:00,254
I wanted to try, but...

1006
00:32:01,745 --> 00:32:03,184
If you don't have enough money,

1007
00:32:03,185 --> 00:32:06,244
the one who paid the least will pay the rest.

1008
00:32:07,614 --> 00:32:08,823
You two...

1009
00:32:08,824 --> 00:32:10,122
This is important.

1010
00:32:10,154 --> 00:32:11,319
- Play rock-paper-scissors. - Or...

1011
00:32:11,654 --> 00:32:13,524
we fill one water gun with water...

1012
00:32:13,525 --> 00:32:14,833
- and leave the other empty. - Okay.

1013
00:32:15,025 --> 00:32:16,333
- You choose one of them. - All right.

1014
00:32:16,664 --> 00:32:17,900
We shoot each other in the face.

1015
00:32:18,564 --> 00:32:20,140
Choose one of...

1016
00:32:20,894 --> 00:32:22,464
the water guns we're holding.

1017
00:32:22,465 --> 00:32:25,004
The one who chooses the water gun filled with water...

1018
00:32:25,005 --> 00:32:26,241
- loses, right? - Yes.

1019
00:32:26,275 --> 00:32:28,366
It's definitely Jae Seok's water gun that's filled.

1020
00:32:28,475 --> 00:32:31,977
I choose Se Chan.

1021
00:32:32,374 --> 00:32:33,888
Why do you choose first?

1022
00:32:34,614 --> 00:32:36,437
- She has a point. - That's right.

1023
00:32:36,485 --> 00:32:38,083
Play rock-paper-scissors to decide who should choose first.

1024
00:32:38,084 --> 00:32:40,613
(They play rock-paper-scissors to decide who should choose first.)

1025
00:32:40,614 --> 00:32:43,613
(Ji Hyo will choose first.)

1026
00:32:44,354 --> 00:32:45,591
Jae Seok.

1027
00:32:46,394 --> 00:32:48,653
- No. I choose Se Chan. - Okay.

1028
00:32:48,654 --> 00:32:51,194
(Ji Hyo thinks Se Chan's water gun is empty.)

1029
00:32:51,195 --> 00:32:52,575
- Water... - What's going on?

1030
00:32:53,064 --> 00:32:54,133
(Water)

1031
00:32:54,134 --> 00:32:55,607
What's going on? What's wrong?

1032
00:32:55,965 --> 00:32:57,234
It suddenly released water.

1033
00:32:57,235 --> 00:32:58,296
Why...

1034
00:32:58,334 --> 00:33:00,540
- Water came out. - It suddenly...

1035
00:33:00,604 --> 00:33:01,833
(Wait, let me think.)

1036
00:33:01,834 --> 00:33:03,451
I choose Jae Seok.

1037
00:33:03,545 --> 00:33:05,120
(Then I have to choose Se Chan?)

1038
00:33:05,305 --> 00:33:07,746
- All right. 1, 2... - 1, 2...

1039
00:33:07,874 --> 00:33:08,945
Three.

1040
00:33:09,445 --> 00:33:10,613
It was Jae Seok's.

1041
00:33:10,614 --> 00:33:11,675
Okay!

1042
00:33:12,314 --> 00:33:13,784
(Although it released water,)

1043
00:33:13,785 --> 00:33:15,423
(Se Chan's water gun turns out to be empty.)

1044
00:33:15,424 --> 00:33:17,588
Ji Hyo, why did you choose mine?

1045
00:33:17,824 --> 00:33:19,752
It suddenly released water on its own.

1046
00:33:20,055 --> 00:33:21,640
Why did I change my mind?

1047
00:33:21,654 --> 00:33:23,757
Why did you choose mine?

1048
00:33:23,824 --> 00:33:25,689
Ji Hyo died while trying to live.

1049
00:33:25,795 --> 00:33:27,994
Right. I died while trying to live.

1050
00:33:27,995 --> 00:33:29,447
(They have lunch after Ji Hyo is confirmed to be at the bottom.)

1051
00:33:29,705 --> 00:33:32,517
(It's time to restore energy.)

1052
00:33:33,074 --> 00:33:35,548
(All kinds of fresh seafood are prepared.)

1053
00:33:36,574 --> 00:33:37,843
- 1 for 2 people? - Oh, my.

1054
00:33:37,844 --> 00:33:39,935
- It looks so tasty. - Oh, my gosh.

1055
00:33:40,644 --> 00:33:42,014
It's steaming.

1056
00:33:42,015 --> 00:33:44,146
This happens every time I'm with Kwang Soo.

1057
00:33:45,185 --> 00:33:47,481
- Hey, stay away from me. - You'll be penalized today.

1058
00:33:47,485 --> 00:33:51,984
For this round, you have to pay 25 dollars.

1059
00:33:51,985 --> 00:33:54,393
(The amount decided by the staff is 25 dollars.)

1060
00:33:54,394 --> 00:33:55,994
(If divided equally, it's 2 dollars and 50 cents per person.)

1061
00:33:55,995 --> 00:33:57,893
- That's not bad. - Then...

1062
00:33:57,894 --> 00:34:00,133
The person at the bottom should think a lot.

1063
00:34:00,134 --> 00:34:03,401
- And the person who paid the least. - Right.

1064
00:34:03,805 --> 00:34:05,865
If we pay more than 25 dollars, the person who paid the most...

1065
00:34:05,874 --> 00:34:06,873
- gets the extra money, right? - Right.

1066
00:34:06,874 --> 00:34:08,403
Do you think we'll pay more than 25 dollars?

1067
00:34:08,404 --> 00:34:10,538
Even if does, the extra money won't be much.

1068
00:34:10,774 --> 00:34:13,217
The food is already cooked. You can go ahead and start.

1069
00:34:13,274 --> 00:34:14,874
- Thank you. - Thank you.

1070
00:34:14,875 --> 00:34:16,698
(Lobster, clams, and braised short ribs)

1071
00:34:16,984 --> 00:34:18,798
(It tastes amazing.)

1072
00:34:19,815 --> 00:34:21,584
- It looks so tasty. - It's very savory.

1073
00:34:21,585 --> 00:34:22,789
(They put the plump lobster in their mouths.)

1074
00:34:24,484 --> 00:34:25,659
It tastes so good.

1075
00:34:26,094 --> 00:34:27,289
This...

1076
00:34:27,555 --> 00:34:29,759
That and a piece of lobster for a dollar.

1077
00:34:29,794 --> 00:34:31,023
I'll eat this.

1078
00:34:31,024 --> 00:34:32,593
(Don't be absurd.)

1079
00:34:32,594 --> 00:34:34,284
(What should I do with him?)

1080
00:34:35,165 --> 00:34:36,576
A piece of galbi for a dollar.

1081
00:34:37,565 --> 00:34:39,173
- I'll eat it. - A dollar.

1082
00:34:39,174 --> 00:34:40,411
- I'll eat it. - I'll give you a dollar.

1083
00:34:40,774 --> 00:34:41,773
- Two dollars. - I'll give you.

1084
00:34:41,774 --> 00:34:43,244
- I'll give you two dollars. - Play rock-paper-scissors.

1085
00:34:43,245 --> 00:34:44,474
You lose if you don't show anything.

1086
00:34:44,475 --> 00:34:45,613
- Rock-paper-scissors. - Rock-paper-scissors.

1087
00:34:45,614 --> 00:34:46,673
Hold on.

1088
00:34:46,674 --> 00:34:47,974
- Give it to Seok Jin. - Okay.

1089
00:34:47,975 --> 00:34:49,355
- How much? - Two dollars.

1090
00:34:49,444 --> 00:34:50,543
- Go away. - All right.

1091
00:34:50,544 --> 00:34:52,750
- Two dollars. - Go away.

1092
00:34:52,785 --> 00:34:55,329
- I'm giving Haha 2 dollars. - 2 dollars to Haha.

1093
00:34:55,384 --> 00:34:56,590
Hey, go away.

1094
00:34:56,654 --> 00:34:58,753
- Abalone looks tasty. - Go away.

1095
00:34:58,754 --> 00:35:00,403
I might drop it.

1096
00:35:01,024 --> 00:35:02,564
I might drop it.

1097
00:35:02,565 --> 00:35:03,664
Stop it. I might drop it.

1098
00:35:03,665 --> 00:35:05,725
Squid in gochujang... Gosh.

1099
00:35:05,895 --> 00:35:07,193
(Ji Hyo takes it.)

1100
00:35:07,194 --> 00:35:08,502
Hey!

1101
00:35:09,205 --> 00:35:10,834
(While Seok Jin was distracted by Kwang Soo,)

1102
00:35:10,835 --> 00:35:12,864
(Ji Hyo takes the lobster.)

1103
00:35:12,975 --> 00:35:14,773
- Give it to me. - Gosh.

1104
00:35:14,774 --> 00:35:15,876
(Kwang Soo steals the galbi and fishcake.)

1105
00:35:16,245 --> 00:35:18,161
- He must be so annoyed. - You said you'd share it with me.

1106
00:35:18,174 --> 00:35:19,349
You said you'd share it with me.

1107
00:35:19,745 --> 00:35:22,247
You... How could you...

1108
00:35:22,285 --> 00:35:24,787
- It tastes so good. - The fishcake tastes amazing.

1109
00:35:25,285 --> 00:35:27,414
I want the small octopus.

1110
00:35:27,415 --> 00:35:28,620
Small octopus for a dollar.

1111
00:35:29,125 --> 00:35:31,762
I didn't know you'd sell food.

1112
00:35:32,794 --> 00:35:34,576
- It sells so well. - Right.

1113
00:35:35,024 --> 00:35:36,064
It tastes amazing.

1114
00:35:36,065 --> 00:35:38,187
(A guest arrives.)

1115
00:35:38,824 --> 00:35:40,277
- Don't give her anything. - You're so good.

1116
00:35:41,134 --> 00:35:42,503
(The owner next door...)

1117
00:35:42,504 --> 00:35:44,833
(gives her a lobster shell.)

1118
00:35:45,165 --> 00:35:46,339
Hold on.

1119
00:35:46,935 --> 00:35:48,273
- Isn't it this? - Stop.

1120
00:35:48,404 --> 00:35:49,475
Isn't it this?

1121
00:35:49,745 --> 00:35:51,644
(It's the piece on Yondu's head.)

1122
00:35:51,645 --> 00:35:53,213
- Yondu. - Yondu.

1123
00:35:53,214 --> 00:35:54,814
- That's it. - Yondu.

1124
00:35:54,815 --> 00:35:56,431
- I thought it looked familiar. - It's Yondu.

1125
00:35:56,544 --> 00:35:57,613
Yondu.

1126
00:35:57,614 --> 00:35:59,645
I'm discouraged because you brought up Yondu.

1127
00:36:00,154 --> 00:36:01,391
I'm embarrassed.

1128
00:36:02,154 --> 00:36:04,684
Yondu even became the most searched word.

1129
00:36:04,685 --> 00:36:06,508
(Embarrassed)

1130
00:36:07,794 --> 00:36:08,928
The last.

1131
00:36:08,995 --> 00:36:10,064
5 seconds. 5...

1132
00:36:10,065 --> 00:36:12,334
Seok Jin, we'll play rock-paper-scissors...

1133
00:36:12,335 --> 00:36:14,291
- and the loser pays for the winner. - Okay.

1134
00:36:14,464 --> 00:36:15,633
- A dollar. - A dollar.

1135
00:36:15,634 --> 00:36:17,233
- Small octopus. - We'll buy small octopus.

1136
00:36:17,234 --> 00:36:18,363
I want it too.

1137
00:36:18,364 --> 00:36:20,539
- This too. - Okay. A dollar.

1138
00:36:21,234 --> 00:36:23,440
- Rock-paper-scissors. - Rock-paper-scissors.

1139
00:36:23,574 --> 00:36:25,986
(Kwang Soo wins.)

1140
00:36:26,044 --> 00:36:27,178
Okay!

1141
00:36:28,015 --> 00:36:30,724
(I can't let you eat.)

1142
00:36:31,315 --> 00:36:32,514
(Fighting)

1143
00:36:32,515 --> 00:36:34,369
Be careful! It's sharp.

1144
00:36:34,614 --> 00:36:36,274
(Stealing)

1145
00:36:37,384 --> 00:36:38,684
(While the two fight,)

1146
00:36:38,685 --> 00:36:41,095
(Ji Hyo steals the small octopus.)

1147
00:36:41,555 --> 00:36:43,664
(Ji Hyo is a habitual thief.)

1148
00:36:43,665 --> 00:36:44,859
Unbelievable.

1149
00:36:44,895 --> 00:36:47,574
This area is so rough.

1150
00:36:47,935 --> 00:36:50,434
Lunch time is over.

1151
00:36:50,435 --> 00:36:51,805
(The fierce lunch time is over.)

1152
00:36:53,274 --> 00:36:55,850
I can't guess what they'll do.

1153
00:36:56,004 --> 00:36:57,773
They have to pay even though they didn't eat anything.

1154
00:36:57,774 --> 00:36:59,052
(Thinking)

1155
00:36:59,074 --> 00:37:01,244
- That doesn't make sense. - Right?

1156
00:37:01,245 --> 00:37:03,084
- Their psychology... - They wouldn't want to pay.

1157
00:37:03,085 --> 00:37:05,284
They wouldn't pay a lot when they didn't eat much.

1158
00:37:05,285 --> 00:37:06,314
Still,

1159
00:37:06,315 --> 00:37:07,314
if we pay more than the bill,

1160
00:37:07,315 --> 00:37:09,554
the one who pays the most can get the extra money.

1161
00:37:09,555 --> 00:37:11,084
They might take a risk.

1162
00:37:11,085 --> 00:37:13,155
The most concerned ones...

1163
00:37:13,395 --> 00:37:15,023
- are the person at the bottom... - Right.

1164
00:37:15,024 --> 00:37:17,164
- and the person who pays the least. - Think about this.

1165
00:37:17,165 --> 00:37:19,873
If many people pay a small amount, it becomes equal.

1166
00:37:20,065 --> 00:37:22,193
- Right. - If 3 people pay a dollar...

1167
00:37:22,194 --> 00:37:23,834
It becomes equal.

1168
00:37:23,835 --> 00:37:26,534
I've sent each of you how much money you have.

1169
00:37:26,535 --> 00:37:27,633
Really?

1170
00:37:27,634 --> 00:37:28,633
I got it.

1171
00:37:28,634 --> 00:37:30,252
(They're informed of the amount of money they have.)

1172
00:37:30,475 --> 00:37:32,947
Seok Jin has the least amount of money right now.

1173
00:37:33,044 --> 00:37:34,073
What?

1174
00:37:34,074 --> 00:37:35,144
- Me? - It's because...

1175
00:37:35,145 --> 00:37:36,628
- you bought a lot of food for us. - You bought food for us.

1176
00:37:37,214 --> 00:37:38,863
Thank you. It was tasty.

1177
00:37:38,915 --> 00:37:40,089
My goodness.

1178
00:37:40,114 --> 00:37:41,351
- You're amazing. - I'm full, to be honest.

1179
00:37:41,614 --> 00:37:43,253
Everyone except Ji Hyo...

1180
00:37:43,254 --> 00:37:45,383
will pay one by one, in whatever order you want.

1181
00:37:45,384 --> 00:37:46,558
In whatever order we want?

1182
00:37:46,625 --> 00:37:48,753
- Say how much you want to pay. - I didn't even eat much.

1183
00:37:48,754 --> 00:37:49,959
I don't want to pay.

1184
00:37:49,995 --> 00:37:51,793
- Let me go first. - Okay.

1185
00:37:51,794 --> 00:37:54,233
- Let me pay a little. - How much will you pay?

1186
00:37:54,234 --> 00:37:56,564
- You're generous. - Pay a lot.

1187
00:37:56,565 --> 00:37:57,834
Pay about eight dollars.

1188
00:37:57,835 --> 00:37:59,733
- To make it easier for you, - 10 dollars?

1189
00:37:59,734 --> 00:38:01,898
- I'll pay about 10 dollars. - What?

1190
00:38:02,544 --> 00:38:03,678
Seriously?

1191
00:38:04,875 --> 00:38:07,800
Jae Seok, how much would you like to pay?

1192
00:38:09,245 --> 00:38:11,862
(Thinking)

1193
00:38:13,384 --> 00:38:17,354
(He accesses the payment page by scanning the QR code.)

1194
00:38:17,355 --> 00:38:19,153
All right. Should I enter the amount here?

1195
00:38:19,154 --> 00:38:22,463
(It's time to enter the amount on his phone.)

1196
00:38:22,464 --> 00:38:23,834
Jae Seok, pay a lot.

1197
00:38:24,094 --> 00:38:26,534
(Lobster, clams, and braised short ribs cost 25 dollars.)

1198
00:38:26,535 --> 00:38:29,064
To make it easier for you, I'll pay about 10 dollars.

1199
00:38:29,065 --> 00:38:31,785
(How much will the first person pay?)

1200
00:38:33,674 --> 00:38:36,972
(2 dollars)

1201
00:38:37,844 --> 00:38:40,213
(Jae Seok paid only 2 dollars.)

1202
00:38:40,214 --> 00:38:43,084
To pay two dollars and pay the least,

1203
00:38:43,085 --> 00:38:44,814
- the others have to pay 3 dollars. - 3 dollars.

1204
00:38:44,815 --> 00:38:47,123
But no one would want to take such a risk.

1205
00:38:47,384 --> 00:38:48,651
Two dollars would be safe.

1206
00:38:48,815 --> 00:38:50,019
Should I go next?

1207
00:38:50,555 --> 00:38:51,965
Pay just the right amount.

1208
00:38:52,254 --> 00:38:53,799
Jong Kook will definitely pay two dollars.

1209
00:38:55,924 --> 00:38:57,064
Two dollars.

1210
00:38:57,065 --> 00:38:58,323
(As expected, he pays 2 dollars.)

1211
00:38:58,324 --> 00:39:01,264
(Trusting the other members, he sticks to 2 dollars.)

1212
00:39:01,265 --> 00:39:02,434
Done.

1213
00:39:02,435 --> 00:39:04,010
- Annie. - Chungha.

1214
00:39:04,305 --> 00:39:05,952
- Show us some waacking. - Waacking.

1215
00:39:06,205 --> 00:39:08,090
- Show us some waacking. - Waack.

1216
00:39:10,074 --> 00:39:11,443
Two dollars.

1217
00:39:11,444 --> 00:39:12,608
(Chungha pays 2 dollars as expected.)

1218
00:39:12,975 --> 00:39:15,573
(Is everyone playing safe?)

1219
00:39:15,574 --> 00:39:18,383
(The members pay secretly one by one.)

1220
00:39:18,384 --> 00:39:20,518
- This is a gamble. - How much would you like to pay?

1221
00:39:21,185 --> 00:39:22,349
Five dollars.

1222
00:39:23,855 --> 00:39:26,494
(In Ah pays 5 dollars.)

1223
00:39:26,495 --> 00:39:29,593
(In Ah pays more than most of the other members.)

1224
00:39:29,594 --> 00:39:31,037
No one would pay 3 or 4 dollars, right?

1225
00:39:31,395 --> 00:39:33,805
Unless someone pays a lot...

1226
00:39:34,065 --> 00:39:35,991
to take the extra money...

1227
00:39:36,004 --> 00:39:38,334
If we pay more than the bill, someone can take the extra money.

1228
00:39:38,335 --> 00:39:40,806
- This is hard. - Let me know one person's amount.

1229
00:39:41,914 --> 00:39:45,112
(Ji Hyo pays last.)

1230
00:39:45,113 --> 00:39:47,052
Just go for it. Do it.

1231
00:39:47,053 --> 00:39:48,652
(If the total amount they pay is not enough for the bill,)

1232
00:39:48,653 --> 00:39:50,332
(Ji Hyo has to pay the rest.)

1233
00:39:51,883 --> 00:39:54,592
Regardless of whether I pay the least or not,

1234
00:39:54,593 --> 00:39:56,862
- I'll have to pay, right? - You'll have to pay.

1235
00:39:56,863 --> 00:39:57,993
If you guys pay more than 25 dollars,

1236
00:39:57,994 --> 00:39:59,167
there'll be no problem.

1237
00:39:59,193 --> 00:40:01,393
It's better to pay a lot. You'll pay anyway.

1238
00:40:01,394 --> 00:40:03,802
But you get only the extra, so think carefully.

1239
00:40:03,803 --> 00:40:06,072
It's better to pay less. Think about it.

1240
00:40:06,073 --> 00:40:07,672
Ji Hyo, no one can...

1241
00:40:07,673 --> 00:40:09,842
- No one can predict the result. - No one can predict the result.

1242
00:40:09,843 --> 00:40:11,072
You can't help it.

1243
00:40:11,073 --> 00:40:13,619
(Thinking)

1244
00:40:14,113 --> 00:40:15,309
I...

1245
00:40:16,383 --> 00:40:18,512
(Will she pay a lot to take the extra money...)

1246
00:40:18,513 --> 00:40:20,676
(or pay little and watch how it goes?)

1247
00:40:20,783 --> 00:40:21,813
(What is her choice?)

1248
00:40:21,814 --> 00:40:23,023
I have to pay anyway,

1249
00:40:23,024 --> 00:40:24,123
so I won't pay anything now.

1250
00:40:24,124 --> 00:40:26,123
(I won't pay anything now.)

1251
00:40:26,124 --> 00:40:28,353
(Ji Hyo does not pay anything.)

1252
00:40:28,354 --> 00:40:31,993
All of you have paid now.

1253
00:40:31,994 --> 00:40:34,163
Tell us if we paid more than the bill.

1254
00:40:34,164 --> 00:40:36,192
- Please. - I don't think we paid more.

1255
00:40:36,204 --> 00:40:39,944
- The total amount paid is... - How much is it?

1256
00:40:40,173 --> 00:40:42,273
(Did they pay more...)

1257
00:40:42,274 --> 00:40:44,405
(than 25 dollars or not?)

1258
00:40:44,644 --> 00:40:46,813
(How much did the 10 members pay in total?)

1259
00:40:46,814 --> 00:40:48,112
29 dollars.

1260
00:40:48,113 --> 00:40:49,212
- Oh, my. - It's over 25 dollars.

1261
00:40:49,213 --> 00:40:50,913
- 29 dollars. - Oh, my.

1262
00:40:50,914 --> 00:40:52,382
(It's 4 more dollars.)

1263
00:40:52,383 --> 00:40:53,691
How did it exceed 25 dollars?

1264
00:40:53,783 --> 00:40:55,353
I guess they paid a lot.

1265
00:40:55,354 --> 00:40:56,692
Did someone pay four dollars?

1266
00:40:56,754 --> 00:40:58,885
The extra four dollars go...

1267
00:40:58,923 --> 00:41:00,822
to the person who paid the most,

1268
00:41:00,823 --> 00:41:02,883
- So Min. - How much did you pay?

1269
00:41:03,294 --> 00:41:06,493
The person who paid the most, Jeon So Min.

1270
00:41:06,494 --> 00:41:07,592
How much did you pay?

1271
00:41:07,593 --> 00:41:09,063
(How much did So Min pay?)

1272
00:41:09,064 --> 00:41:11,532
- So Min would take a risk. - She would.

1273
00:41:11,533 --> 00:41:13,048
She'd take a risk.

1274
00:41:13,233 --> 00:41:14,402
10 dollars.

1275
00:41:14,403 --> 00:41:16,543
(10 dollars.)

1276
00:41:16,544 --> 00:41:19,643
(She paid as much as 10 dollars.)

1277
00:41:19,644 --> 00:41:20,842
I still lost money.

1278
00:41:20,843 --> 00:41:22,286
- What? - I lost money.

1279
00:41:22,584 --> 00:41:23,782
How much did you pay?

1280
00:41:23,783 --> 00:41:26,183
Did you pay a lot in order to win, didn't you?

1281
00:41:26,184 --> 00:41:27,451
Did you pay 10 dollars?

1282
00:41:27,983 --> 00:41:29,528
I don't know. How much did I pay?

1283
00:41:29,553 --> 00:41:31,982
In any case, four dollars which exceeded the total cost...

1284
00:41:31,983 --> 00:41:33,753
will go to So Min,

1285
00:41:33,754 --> 00:41:34,793
That's incredible.

1286
00:41:34,794 --> 00:41:37,091
Those who paid little...

1287
00:41:37,164 --> 00:41:38,893
also benefited from this round.

1288
00:41:38,894 --> 00:41:40,032
- That's right. - Who?

1289
00:41:40,033 --> 00:41:41,032
Who paid little?

1290
00:41:41,033 --> 00:41:42,262
I bet Ji Hyo paid a lot.

1291
00:41:42,263 --> 00:41:43,644
You didn't pay, did you?

1292
00:41:43,803 --> 00:41:46,072
- You didn't pay, did you? - Did anyone not pay?

1293
00:41:46,073 --> 00:41:47,340
- You didn't pay, did you? - I paid.

1294
00:41:47,633 --> 00:41:49,220
Everyone paid.

1295
00:41:49,374 --> 00:41:50,773
That's too ballsy.

1296
00:41:50,774 --> 00:41:52,172
You could end up paying the remaining amount.

1297
00:41:52,173 --> 00:41:54,342
Let's move on to the next location.

1298
00:41:54,343 --> 00:41:55,773
(It's time to eat the next invigorating food.)

1299
00:41:55,774 --> 00:41:56,916
Come on!

1300
00:41:59,854 --> 00:42:01,976
(The members' current amount of money)

1301
00:42:02,283 --> 00:42:04,180
Gosh, it already smells good.

1302
00:42:04,923 --> 00:42:06,793
I smell hinoki cypress.

1303
00:42:06,794 --> 00:42:08,123
- It smells good. - I know.

1304
00:42:08,124 --> 00:42:09,462
It smells good.

1305
00:42:09,463 --> 00:42:10,623
Can we open the lid?

1306
00:42:10,624 --> 00:42:12,623
- Let's go. - In 1, 2, 3.

1307
00:42:14,233 --> 00:42:16,632
(Beef steamed in hinoki cypress box)

1308
00:42:16,633 --> 00:42:19,163
It's bound to be tasty.

1309
00:42:19,164 --> 00:42:20,203
Is that beef brisket?

1310
00:42:20,204 --> 00:42:21,749
- It's beef brisket. - Gosh, it smells good.

1311
00:42:21,974 --> 00:42:24,442
This will reset our palate.

1312
00:42:24,443 --> 00:42:26,672
Gosh, the aroma is insane. I must eat it.

1313
00:42:26,673 --> 00:42:28,940
- I must eat it. - You can dip this...

1314
00:42:29,684 --> 00:42:31,671
- in a sauce. - I must eat it.

1315
00:42:31,783 --> 00:42:33,683
Beef steamed in hinoki cypress box...

1316
00:42:33,684 --> 00:42:35,922
and the order of payments are on the second mission,

1317
00:42:35,923 --> 00:42:38,354
Race of Witty Answers.

1318
00:42:39,224 --> 00:42:40,393
- Race of Witty Answers. - Race of Witty Answers.

1319
00:42:40,394 --> 00:42:41,793
It sounds like...

1320
00:42:41,794 --> 00:42:42,962
- my kind of a game. - It's about wits.

1321
00:42:42,963 --> 00:42:44,163
He loves games of wits.

1322
00:42:44,164 --> 00:42:45,987
You will play independently.

1323
00:42:46,033 --> 00:42:47,163
You will answer...

1324
00:42:47,164 --> 00:42:48,914
- in the methods of Race of Wits. - Okay.

1325
00:42:48,934 --> 00:42:51,032
When the production crew gives you a theme,

1326
00:42:51,033 --> 00:42:52,973
stand up and give an answer with the number of Korean letters...

1327
00:42:52,974 --> 00:42:54,072
that is in accordance with the order.

1328
00:42:54,073 --> 00:42:55,603
Use your wits to decide when to stand up.

1329
00:42:55,604 --> 00:42:58,014
(Members who stand up simultaneously will be eliminated.)

1330
00:42:58,843 --> 00:43:00,773
The faster you go, the easier it is.

1331
00:43:00,774 --> 00:43:02,743
The last person will have to give a 10-letter answer.

1332
00:43:02,744 --> 00:43:04,612
Only four people will get...

1333
00:43:04,613 --> 00:43:06,612
- to eat the beef. - Four people.

1334
00:43:06,613 --> 00:43:09,982
(Only four people will get to eat.)

1335
00:43:09,983 --> 00:43:11,152
- Let's do this. - I must eat this.

1336
00:43:11,153 --> 00:43:12,183
- Let's go. - I will go first.

1337
00:43:12,184 --> 00:43:13,893
- Okay. - Those who wait will win.

1338
00:43:13,894 --> 00:43:14,986
Let's begin.

1339
00:43:15,093 --> 00:43:17,822
Where do you want to go right now?

1340
00:43:17,823 --> 00:43:18,893
Guam.

1341
00:43:18,894 --> 00:43:21,762
(Where do you want to go right now?)

1342
00:43:21,763 --> 00:43:23,032
- Tokyo. - Ladies' room.

1343
00:43:23,033 --> 00:43:24,239
Israel.

1344
00:43:24,903 --> 00:43:26,582
(They are good.)

1345
00:43:27,903 --> 00:43:29,273
Budapest.

1346
00:43:29,274 --> 00:43:30,672
("Budapest" has 5 letters in Korean.)

1347
00:43:30,673 --> 00:43:31,837
(Hesitant)

1348
00:43:32,474 --> 00:43:34,572
(It's time to give a six-letter answer.)

1349
00:43:34,573 --> 00:43:35,603
Addis Ababa.

1350
00:43:36,084 --> 00:43:38,206
(Standing up)

1351
00:43:39,044 --> 00:43:40,836
(They stand up at the same time.)

1352
00:43:41,254 --> 00:43:42,282
They stood up at the same time, right?

1353
00:43:42,283 --> 00:43:43,683
- But... - Jong Kook.

1354
00:43:43,684 --> 00:43:44,753
- Hold on. - Thank goodness.

1355
00:43:44,754 --> 00:43:46,192
- Thank goodness. - Why?

1356
00:43:46,193 --> 00:43:47,753
Jong Kook didn't give an answer.

1357
00:43:47,754 --> 00:43:49,462
You stood up at the same time.

1358
00:43:49,463 --> 00:43:51,322
Is standing up together enough to get you eliminated?

1359
00:43:51,323 --> 00:43:52,962
- Listen. - I didn't know.

1360
00:43:52,963 --> 00:43:54,663
- You didn't know, right? - That's right.

1361
00:43:54,664 --> 00:43:55,893
I didn't know.

1362
00:43:55,894 --> 00:43:57,861
I didn't know. You didn't know, right?

1363
00:43:58,104 --> 00:43:59,873
(They shake hands.)

1364
00:43:59,874 --> 00:44:01,831
This is Race of Wits!

1365
00:44:01,834 --> 00:44:03,342
- Listen. - I didn't know.

1366
00:44:03,343 --> 00:44:05,473
I thought I had to give an answer. I didn't know.

1367
00:44:05,474 --> 00:44:07,813
- I didn't know. - We will accept if the rest agrees.

1368
00:44:07,814 --> 00:44:09,382
- Accept it. - Hold on.

1369
00:44:09,383 --> 00:44:10,682
- Accept it. - I didn't know.

1370
00:44:10,713 --> 00:44:12,877
- In Ah and Chungha, do you agree? - Yes.

1371
00:44:13,783 --> 00:44:14,982
(When Jae Seok asked them if they agree,)

1372
00:44:14,983 --> 00:44:16,282
(Chungha answered, "Yes".)

1373
00:44:16,283 --> 00:44:18,382
- She agrees. - Why did you say that?

1374
00:44:18,383 --> 00:44:19,393
She agrees.

1375
00:44:19,394 --> 00:44:20,922
Do you know what you agreed with?

1376
00:44:20,923 --> 00:44:22,152
- Chungha had no idea. - Chungha...

1377
00:44:22,153 --> 00:44:24,393
Chungha agreed without knowing what I asked.

1378
00:44:24,394 --> 00:44:25,962
- All right. - Let's play again.

1379
00:44:25,963 --> 00:44:28,063
- In Ah. - Let me be clear with the rules.

1380
00:44:28,064 --> 00:44:29,402
Standing up at the same time will get you eliminated.

1381
00:44:29,403 --> 00:44:31,663
How about shouting out an answer?

1382
00:44:31,664 --> 00:44:33,072
If you sit down and do it, I won't count it.

1383
00:44:33,073 --> 00:44:34,632
- Okay. - I will go first.

1384
00:44:34,633 --> 00:44:35,873
I will go third.

1385
00:44:35,874 --> 00:44:37,302
- All right. - Let's begin.

1386
00:44:37,303 --> 00:44:38,302
You will win if you wait.

1387
00:44:38,303 --> 00:44:40,743
What do you want to be in your next life?

1388
00:44:40,744 --> 00:44:42,373
- Hero. - Chicken.

1389
00:44:42,374 --> 00:44:43,482
- Hero. - Chicken.

1390
00:44:43,483 --> 00:44:44,612
(Ji Hyo and Haha are out.)

1391
00:44:44,613 --> 00:44:46,453
- I said I will go first. - Okay.

1392
00:44:46,454 --> 00:44:48,926
I almost shouted out, "Poop".

1393
00:44:49,013 --> 00:44:51,393
It was begging Jae Seok to answer.

1394
00:44:51,584 --> 00:44:53,393
The fourth question must be answered...

1395
00:44:53,394 --> 00:44:55,052
with a gesture.

1396
00:44:55,053 --> 00:44:56,762
- A gesture? - Okay. That's good.

1397
00:44:56,763 --> 00:44:59,063
Get ready. Set, go.

1398
00:44:59,064 --> 00:45:01,772
What do you say to seduce someone?

1399
00:45:03,033 --> 00:45:04,959
- Kiss. - Okay.

1400
00:45:05,064 --> 00:45:06,632
What's up?

1401
00:45:06,633 --> 00:45:07,973
I love you.

1402
00:45:08,533 --> 00:45:09,902
Be mine.

1403
00:45:09,903 --> 00:45:12,170
(It's an energetic way of seducing someone.)

1404
00:45:12,774 --> 00:45:14,572
(Is that how he seduces someone?)

1405
00:45:14,573 --> 00:45:15,644
It's scary.

1406
00:45:16,613 --> 00:45:17,921
You have my heart.

1407
00:45:18,013 --> 00:45:19,342
Have my child.

1408
00:45:19,343 --> 00:45:20,651
(A middle-aged man's way of seducing someone)

1409
00:45:22,883 --> 00:45:24,782
- It has six letters in Korean! - What was that?

1410
00:45:24,783 --> 00:45:27,152
It has six letters! I gave the right answer.

1411
00:45:27,153 --> 00:45:28,493
It does have 6 letters. The next one is a 7-letter answer.

1412
00:45:28,494 --> 00:45:29,563
A seven-letter answer.

1413
00:45:29,564 --> 00:45:31,063
I love you forever and ever.

1414
00:45:31,064 --> 00:45:34,132
(I love you forever and ever.)

1415
00:45:34,133 --> 00:45:35,563
It has eight words in Korean.

1416
00:45:35,564 --> 00:45:36,732
I can't believe him.

1417
00:45:36,733 --> 00:45:38,764
He is really bad at games.

1418
00:45:39,204 --> 00:45:41,232
- He is really bad at playing games. - I can't seduce, so I stayed quiet.

1419
00:45:41,233 --> 00:45:43,473
- Listen. - What do you have to say?

1420
00:45:43,474 --> 00:45:46,143
- I love you forever. - "I love you forever"?

1421
00:45:46,144 --> 00:45:48,646
- Just go. - Come here.

1422
00:45:48,744 --> 00:45:50,683
- You said "Forever and ever". - This is driving me crazy.

1423
00:45:50,684 --> 00:45:52,393
He can't even insist without Jong Kook.

1424
00:45:54,053 --> 00:45:56,320
(He can't even insist without Jong Kook.)

1425
00:45:56,684 --> 00:45:58,920
You were given a chance.

1426
00:45:58,923 --> 00:46:00,293
Please sit down.

1427
00:46:00,294 --> 00:46:01,922
- All right. - Please scoot to the middle.

1428
00:46:01,923 --> 00:46:02,922
Please scoot to the middle.

1429
00:46:02,923 --> 00:46:04,262
My goodness.

1430
00:46:04,263 --> 00:46:05,355
Let's resume.

1431
00:46:06,434 --> 00:46:09,902
Which nickname would you give to the person to your right?

1432
00:46:09,903 --> 00:46:11,202
Poop.

1433
00:46:11,334 --> 00:46:12,642
Beggar.

1434
00:46:13,104 --> 00:46:14,515
Cutie.

1435
00:46:15,303 --> 00:46:16,572
(Chungha is the best.)

1436
00:46:16,573 --> 00:46:17,572
Pot belly.

1437
00:46:17,573 --> 00:46:18,603
Marilyn Monroe.

1438
00:46:18,604 --> 00:46:19,675
("Marilyn Monroe" has five letters in Korean.)

1439
00:46:20,113 --> 00:46:22,743
(Seok Jin and In Ah remain.)

1440
00:46:22,744 --> 00:46:24,183
Eternal Sunshine.

1441
00:46:24,184 --> 00:46:25,996
(It's the title of a movie.)

1442
00:46:26,254 --> 00:46:27,712
- What did she say? - "Eternal Sunshine".

1443
00:46:27,713 --> 00:46:29,919
- Isn't that the title of a movie? - "Eternal Sunshine"?

1444
00:46:30,283 --> 00:46:31,870
- It makes sense, but... - It's not a nickname.

1445
00:46:32,084 --> 00:46:33,922
Can't it be a nickname?

1446
00:46:33,923 --> 00:46:35,322
- No. - She is right.

1447
00:46:35,323 --> 00:46:37,013
- Seok Jin, come here. - No!

1448
00:46:37,263 --> 00:46:38,393
(In Ah is right.)

1449
00:46:38,394 --> 00:46:40,163
(Seok Jin, come here.)

1450
00:46:40,164 --> 00:46:41,843
- It's not a nickname. - Come here.

1451
00:46:41,994 --> 00:46:43,477
- All right. - Come on.

1452
00:46:43,664 --> 00:46:46,003
It would be a shame to get eliminated right now.

1453
00:46:46,004 --> 00:46:47,402
(With Seok Jin out, 6 members remain.)

1454
00:46:47,403 --> 00:46:48,608
Let's go.

1455
00:46:48,733 --> 00:46:49,980
Get ready.

1456
00:46:50,244 --> 00:46:52,746
What do you say to break up?

1457
00:46:53,173 --> 00:46:54,615
- Go. - Get lost.

1458
00:46:55,613 --> 00:46:56,683
Stop it.

1459
00:46:56,684 --> 00:46:58,112
(Standing up)

1460
00:46:58,113 --> 00:47:00,183
(So Min and In Ah are out.)

1461
00:47:00,184 --> 00:47:02,007
- We are still in. - We have hope.

1462
00:47:02,584 --> 00:47:04,453
- In Ah and So Min, come here. - All right.

1463
00:47:04,454 --> 00:47:07,192
Get ready. Let's go.

1464
00:47:07,193 --> 00:47:08,842
What do you want to do before you die?

1465
00:47:10,064 --> 00:47:11,422
What do you want to do before you die?

1466
00:47:11,423 --> 00:47:12,453
(Kwang Soo stands up by himself.)

1467
00:47:13,263 --> 00:47:14,333
You stood up.

1468
00:47:14,334 --> 00:47:15,692
- Come here. - You have 5 seconds. 5,

1469
00:47:15,693 --> 00:47:17,333
4, 3, 2.

1470
00:47:17,334 --> 00:47:18,862
- He is out. - Okay.

1471
00:47:18,863 --> 00:47:20,232
(He gets eliminated for staying quiet.)

1472
00:47:20,233 --> 00:47:22,333
- Why didn't you answer? - You stood up.

1473
00:47:22,334 --> 00:47:23,743
You should have given an answer.

1474
00:47:23,744 --> 00:47:25,902
- How strange! - For goodness' sake.

1475
00:47:25,903 --> 00:47:27,831
We are almost there.

1476
00:47:28,173 --> 00:47:30,982
There are only three people left, so we will go speedily.

1477
00:47:30,983 --> 00:47:33,683
Get ready. Set, go.

1478
00:47:33,684 --> 00:47:34,953
What do you want to be in your next life?

1479
00:47:34,954 --> 00:47:36,012
King.

1480
00:47:36,013 --> 00:47:37,322
(Startled)

1481
00:47:37,323 --> 00:47:38,382
That was a good one.

1482
00:47:38,383 --> 00:47:40,223
(Se Chan can neither stand up nor sit down.)

1483
00:47:40,224 --> 00:47:41,322
Bat.

1484
00:47:41,323 --> 00:47:42,353
(My goodness.)

1485
00:47:42,653 --> 00:47:44,993
(He became startled after standing up a little.)

1486
00:47:44,994 --> 00:47:47,232
(I don't know what to do.)

1487
00:47:47,233 --> 00:47:49,163
What was that just now?

1488
00:47:49,164 --> 00:47:51,232
What are you, a zombie?

1489
00:47:51,233 --> 00:47:52,663
I stopped halfway.

1490
00:47:52,664 --> 00:47:54,456
(I am not a zombie.)

1491
00:47:54,504 --> 00:47:55,773
- I thought I had a cramp. - That startled me.

1492
00:47:55,774 --> 00:47:58,342
- That startled me. - It was like "Ju-On".

1493
00:47:58,343 --> 00:47:59,712
That startled me.

1494
00:47:59,713 --> 00:48:01,512
(Chungha and Jong Kook win the right to eat.)

1495
00:48:01,513 --> 00:48:04,643
Chungha and Jong Kook won the right to eat.

1496
00:48:04,644 --> 00:48:05,777
Okay.

1497
00:48:06,184 --> 00:48:07,522
This time,

1498
00:48:07,613 --> 00:48:10,322
the first place will also choose the last person to pay.

1499
00:48:10,323 --> 00:48:14,293
(The right to eat and choose the last person to pay)

1500
00:48:14,294 --> 00:48:17,251
The winners of the previous round will get a dollar if they win again.

1501
00:48:17,423 --> 00:48:20,163
Let's begin. Get ready. Set, go.

1502
00:48:20,164 --> 00:48:21,328
Which movie did you enjoy?

1503
00:48:21,633 --> 00:48:22,797
"Mulberry".

1504
00:48:23,064 --> 00:48:24,163
What?

1505
00:48:24,164 --> 00:48:25,402
Does it exist?

1506
00:48:25,403 --> 00:48:26,567
Yes, it does.

1507
00:48:26,733 --> 00:48:28,703
- Don't you know "Mulberry"? - Oh, "Mulberry"?

1508
00:48:28,704 --> 00:48:29,734
"Friend".

1509
00:48:29,843 --> 00:48:30,873
"Aladdin".

1510
00:48:30,874 --> 00:48:31,973
(Haha succeeded to buy some time.)

1511
00:48:31,974 --> 00:48:34,043
("Aladdin".)

1512
00:48:34,044 --> 00:48:35,280
- "The Predator". - "The Predator".

1513
00:48:36,283 --> 00:48:37,345
What?

1514
00:48:37,483 --> 00:48:38,482
What was that?

1515
00:48:38,483 --> 00:48:39,753
Did you watch it together?

1516
00:48:39,754 --> 00:48:41,535
("The Predator" reveals their love.)

1517
00:48:42,454 --> 00:48:43,723
(Flustered)

1518
00:48:43,724 --> 00:48:45,382
- Did you watch it together? - Did you watch it together?

1519
00:48:45,383 --> 00:48:47,001
I got goosebumps.

1520
00:48:48,153 --> 00:48:49,793
- What was that? - I guess they watched it together.

1521
00:48:49,794 --> 00:48:51,163
Jong Kook has problems.

1522
00:48:51,164 --> 00:48:52,322
The two of them are out.

1523
00:48:52,323 --> 00:48:53,362
(Jong Kook and In Ah are out.)

1524
00:48:53,363 --> 00:48:55,660
- Let's go. - I should have chosen "Titanic".

1525
00:48:57,604 --> 00:48:59,797
- Get ready. - Do you want to get eliminated?

1526
00:49:00,204 --> 00:49:01,703
I think he will get eliminated right away.

1527
00:49:01,704 --> 00:49:04,455
- Seriously. - I will stand up in 0.1 seconds.

1528
00:49:04,974 --> 00:49:06,072
Get ready.

1529
00:49:06,073 --> 00:49:08,043
Set, go.

1530
00:49:08,044 --> 00:49:09,382
How do you feel right now?

1531
00:49:09,783 --> 00:49:10,782
Best.

1532
00:49:10,783 --> 00:49:11,916
So good.

1533
00:49:13,053 --> 00:49:14,248
I am happy.

1534
00:49:14,713 --> 00:49:16,583
(I am happy.)

1535
00:49:16,584 --> 00:49:18,334
- I am quite upset. - Pretty good.

1536
00:49:22,153 --> 00:49:23,348
I am happy.

1537
00:49:24,013 --> 00:49:25,683
(I am happy.)

1538
00:49:25,684 --> 00:49:27,434
- I am quite upset. - Pretty good.

1539
00:49:28,686 --> 00:49:29,746
Very nice.

1540
00:49:29,885 --> 00:49:31,575
- Okay! - What?

1541
00:49:31,786 --> 00:49:34,355
("Very nice" has 5 letters in Korean.)

1542
00:49:34,356 --> 00:49:36,251
- It has five letters. - Okay.

1543
00:49:36,356 --> 00:49:38,524
- "Very nice" has five letters. - Very very nice.

1544
00:49:38,525 --> 00:49:40,070
- No. - Seok Jin.

1545
00:49:40,326 --> 00:49:41,943
- No. - Very very nice.

1546
00:49:41,996 --> 00:49:44,665
- Go. - Very very nice.

1547
00:49:44,666 --> 00:49:45,734
Go.

1548
00:49:45,735 --> 00:49:47,464
Seok Jin, you are really bad at this game.

1549
00:49:47,465 --> 00:49:48,805
You are bad at it, too.

1550
00:49:48,806 --> 00:49:50,114
It will be funny if they compete against each other.

1551
00:49:50,706 --> 00:49:53,475
What were you going to say after "Okay"?

1552
00:49:53,476 --> 00:49:54,944
What were you going to say after "Okay"?

1553
00:49:54,945 --> 00:49:57,005
I simply said it because Seok Jin got eliminated.

1554
00:49:57,215 --> 00:49:59,410
- It wasn't an answer. - No.

1555
00:49:59,985 --> 00:50:01,015
Get ready.

1556
00:50:01,715 --> 00:50:04,984
Set, go. What do you say to seduce someone?

1557
00:50:04,985 --> 00:50:07,924
(What do you say to seduce someone?)

1558
00:50:07,925 --> 00:50:09,294
- Muah. - Come on.

1559
00:50:09,295 --> 00:50:10,294
I love you.

1560
00:50:10,295 --> 00:50:11,707
Okay!

1561
00:50:11,795 --> 00:50:12,964
- Hold on. - What was that?

1562
00:50:12,965 --> 00:50:15,194
- "Okay" makes no sense. - What was that?

1563
00:50:15,195 --> 00:50:16,765
- Listen. - You are out.

1564
00:50:16,766 --> 00:50:18,805
- You are out. It makes no sense. - Stop it.

1565
00:50:18,806 --> 00:50:21,674
No one says that to seduce another person.

1566
00:50:21,675 --> 00:50:23,274
You are the worst man.

1567
00:50:23,275 --> 00:50:24,542
- It works, right? - What?

1568
00:50:24,646 --> 00:50:26,075
- "Okay" works, right? - It works.

1569
00:50:26,076 --> 00:50:27,375
- It works. - I would use it.

1570
00:50:27,376 --> 00:50:28,475
When you propose,

1571
00:50:28,476 --> 00:50:29,915
- will you say, "Okay"? - Okay.

1572
00:50:29,916 --> 00:50:30,915
It works.

1573
00:50:30,916 --> 00:50:32,491
- No way. - Listen.

1574
00:50:32,585 --> 00:50:33,645
- That's not the right example. - It works.

1575
00:50:33,646 --> 00:50:35,114
"Honey, would you buy me this?"

1576
00:50:35,115 --> 00:50:36,654
- "Okay." - Okay.

1577
00:50:36,655 --> 00:50:38,685
- "Would you buy me this?" - It works.

1578
00:50:38,686 --> 00:50:39,825
(No matter what she wants, he will say, "Okay.")

1579
00:50:39,826 --> 00:50:41,694
- "Honey." - It works in some situations.

1580
00:50:41,695 --> 00:50:43,455
- "I love you. Okay." - It does work.

1581
00:50:43,456 --> 00:50:44,595
- Jong Kook. - I told you it works.

1582
00:50:44,596 --> 00:50:46,024
- Okay. - Okay.

1583
00:50:46,025 --> 00:50:48,035
- Let's say she looks amazing. - It worked...

1584
00:50:48,036 --> 00:50:49,294
- back in our days. - "Okay."

1585
00:50:49,295 --> 00:50:50,595
It works.

1586
00:50:50,596 --> 00:50:52,805
- I told you it works. - Raise your hand...

1587
00:50:52,806 --> 00:50:54,453
if you don't think "Okay" works.

1588
00:50:55,036 --> 00:50:56,066
There is no one.

1589
00:50:56,275 --> 00:50:58,232
- When you think about it... - There is no one.

1590
00:50:58,576 --> 00:50:59,575
Jae Seok is out.

1591
00:50:59,576 --> 00:51:01,121
Chungha, how could you raise two hands?

1592
00:51:02,016 --> 00:51:03,544
(I am sorry, but I love you.)

1593
00:51:03,545 --> 00:51:04,984
"Okay" works.

1594
00:51:04,985 --> 00:51:06,845
We said that a lot back in the days.

1595
00:51:06,846 --> 00:51:08,555
"Okay" works at all times.

1596
00:51:08,556 --> 00:51:10,780
"Shall we go and eat meat?" "Okay."

1597
00:51:11,085 --> 00:51:12,702
Let's move on to the next question.

1598
00:51:13,326 --> 00:51:15,294
I can't believe they think "Okay" is incorrect.

1599
00:51:15,295 --> 00:51:18,798
Let's go. What do you say when your ex calls?

1600
00:51:19,096 --> 00:51:20,126
Why?

1601
00:51:20,195 --> 00:51:21,194
Get lost.

1602
00:51:21,195 --> 00:51:22,225
(What do you say when your ex calls?)

1603
00:51:22,695 --> 00:51:24,194
(Haha stands up.)

1604
00:51:24,195 --> 00:51:25,404
(For goodness' sake.)

1605
00:51:25,405 --> 00:51:26,605
They stood up at the same time.

1606
00:51:26,606 --> 00:51:27,975
(They stood up at the same time again.)

1607
00:51:27,976 --> 00:51:29,975
- Haha. - I twitched.

1608
00:51:29,976 --> 00:51:32,345
"Okay" works for this question, too.

1609
00:51:32,346 --> 00:51:33,845
How does it work?

1610
00:51:33,846 --> 00:51:34,876
Why doesn't it work?

1611
00:51:35,175 --> 00:51:36,544
How does it work?

1612
00:51:36,545 --> 00:51:38,605
Let's say your ex called. "Okay."

1613
00:51:39,846 --> 00:51:41,754
- My goodness. - "Okay."

1614
00:51:41,755 --> 00:51:43,084
- "Okay." - It works.

1615
00:51:43,085 --> 00:51:44,754
Let's say you were waiting for your ex to call.

1616
00:51:44,755 --> 00:51:46,084
"Okay."

1617
00:51:46,085 --> 00:51:47,084
"Okay."

1618
00:51:47,085 --> 00:51:49,362
- "Honey?" "Okay." - "Okay."

1619
00:51:50,695 --> 00:51:52,225
Then the ex will be happy.

1620
00:51:52,226 --> 00:51:53,395
I am telling you it works.

1621
00:51:53,396 --> 00:51:56,395
Let's go. Get ready. Set, go.

1622
00:51:56,396 --> 00:51:58,904
What do you want to choose as the family motto?

1623
00:51:58,905 --> 00:51:59,935
Best.

1624
00:52:00,206 --> 00:52:01,705
- Let's live. - "Okay."

1625
00:52:01,706 --> 00:52:03,014
Happy.

1626
00:52:03,335 --> 00:52:04,475
Chungha is out.

1627
00:52:04,476 --> 00:52:06,705
- Okay. - Shouldn't it be "Let's be happy"?

1628
00:52:06,706 --> 00:52:07,915
- "Happy". - Happiness.

1629
00:52:07,916 --> 00:52:09,645
- It's strange. - Happiness. Happiness.

1630
00:52:09,646 --> 00:52:10,714
So Min, you are out.

1631
00:52:10,715 --> 00:52:12,641
Okay, So Min.

1632
00:52:12,746 --> 00:52:13,745
You're back.

1633
00:52:13,746 --> 00:52:15,384
- Okay. - Okay, So Min.

1634
00:52:15,385 --> 00:52:16,685
I got eliminated in the end.

1635
00:52:16,686 --> 00:52:18,384
I will go first.

1636
00:52:18,385 --> 00:52:20,984
Look at those fools on Chungha's sides.

1637
00:52:20,985 --> 00:52:22,027
(Look at those fools on Chungha's sides.)

1638
00:52:22,726 --> 00:52:23,754
(They look like fools next to Chungha.)

1639
00:52:23,755 --> 00:52:24,895
- What are you saying? - Seriously.

1640
00:52:24,896 --> 00:52:26,095
Don't be mean.

1641
00:52:26,096 --> 00:52:28,734
The fools on Princess Chungha's sides.

1642
00:52:28,735 --> 00:52:29,995
Gosh, I am annoyed.

1643
00:52:29,996 --> 00:52:31,504
Chungha, you won the previous round.

1644
00:52:31,505 --> 00:52:33,875
That's right. You should let us win.

1645
00:52:34,106 --> 00:52:35,605
Get ready. Set, go.

1646
00:52:35,606 --> 00:52:37,174
Name a famous person you admire.

1647
00:52:37,175 --> 00:52:38,375
(Name a famous person you admire.)

1648
00:52:38,376 --> 00:52:39,375
One letter.

1649
00:52:39,376 --> 00:52:41,575
(A famous person?)

1650
00:52:41,576 --> 00:52:42,714
Is there a one-letter name?

1651
00:52:42,715 --> 00:52:44,174
(Name a famous person you admire.)

1652
00:52:44,175 --> 00:52:45,345
(Is there a one-letter name?)

1653
00:52:45,346 --> 00:52:46,859
Who invented the telephone?

1654
00:52:47,286 --> 00:52:48,316
- Bell! - Bell!

1655
00:52:49,416 --> 00:52:51,185
(They answer at the same time.)

1656
00:52:51,186 --> 00:52:52,984
(I am sick and tired of you.)

1657
00:52:52,985 --> 00:52:54,855
- I am sick and tired of you. - For goodness' sake.

1658
00:52:54,856 --> 00:52:56,885
- Bell. - It came to your mind, right?

1659
00:52:57,096 --> 00:52:58,665
- You are such a cheat. - For goodness' sake.

1660
00:52:58,666 --> 00:52:59,861
I can't believe you.

1661
00:52:59,865 --> 00:53:01,895
For goodness' sake. I am sick and tired of you.

1662
00:53:01,896 --> 00:53:03,998
All right. Mr. Gums and Mr. Fool are out.

1663
00:53:04,096 --> 00:53:05,105
(Se Chan and Kwang Soo are out.)

1664
00:53:05,106 --> 00:53:06,404
How did Bell come to mind as soon as I heard the hint?

1665
00:53:06,405 --> 00:53:08,105
Now, Chungha will choose one person...

1666
00:53:08,106 --> 00:53:10,269
to eat with. Then we will have the last round.

1667
00:53:10,376 --> 00:53:12,127
- Okay. - Four people will eat.

1668
00:53:12,445 --> 00:53:14,105
Chungha will choose one person to eat with.

1669
00:53:14,106 --> 00:53:16,237
We struggled until the end.

1670
00:53:16,376 --> 00:53:17,375
I choose "Okay."

1671
00:53:17,376 --> 00:53:18,745
Okay!

1672
00:53:18,746 --> 00:53:19,944
I contributed to that answer.

1673
00:53:19,945 --> 00:53:22,017
(She chooses Jae Seok without hesitation.)

1674
00:53:22,585 --> 00:53:24,234
(Sighing)

1675
00:53:24,356 --> 00:53:25,725
Okay. Thank you, Chungha.

1676
00:53:25,726 --> 00:53:27,786
- Chungha, he ate. - For goodness' sake.

1677
00:53:27,996 --> 00:53:29,995
You deserted your friend.

1678
00:53:29,996 --> 00:53:31,564
I feel bad about raising both hands earlier.

1679
00:53:31,565 --> 00:53:33,665
- I see. - People who will eat...

1680
00:53:33,666 --> 00:53:35,564
are Jae Seok, Jong Kook, and Chungha.

1681
00:53:35,565 --> 00:53:37,294
We will have another round to choose the last person.

1682
00:53:37,295 --> 00:53:38,882
- Okay. - Let's go.

1683
00:53:40,036 --> 00:53:42,334
Let's begin. Go.

1684
00:53:42,335 --> 00:53:44,745
What do you want to buy your love on an anniversary?

1685
00:53:44,746 --> 00:53:45,745
Tangerine.

1686
00:53:45,746 --> 00:53:47,250
- "Tangerine"? - Ring.

1687
00:53:47,675 --> 00:53:48,674
Necklace.

1688
00:53:48,675 --> 00:53:51,214
("Necklace" has 3 letters in Korean.)

1689
00:53:51,215 --> 00:53:52,997
Jae Seok, why aren't you saying "Okay"?

1690
00:53:53,385 --> 00:53:54,652
Okay.

1691
00:53:54,885 --> 00:53:56,785
Keychain.

1692
00:53:56,786 --> 00:53:57,814
Polaroid.

1693
00:53:57,815 --> 00:53:59,725
(What do you want to buy your love on an anniversary?)

1694
00:53:59,726 --> 00:54:00,984
(It's a witty answer.)

1695
00:54:00,985 --> 00:54:03,654
(What do you want to buy your love on an anniversary?)

1696
00:54:03,655 --> 00:54:04,924
SUV.

1697
00:54:04,925 --> 00:54:07,725
(It's time to give a six-letter answer.)

1698
00:54:07,726 --> 00:54:08,765
- What? - SUV?

1699
00:54:08,766 --> 00:54:09,930
Doesn't it have five letters?

1700
00:54:09,965 --> 00:54:11,404
- Okay. - SUV.

1701
00:54:11,405 --> 00:54:13,705
- Okay. - SUV is an English word,

1702
00:54:13,706 --> 00:54:15,322
- so it has three letters. - A vehicle.

1703
00:54:15,635 --> 00:54:17,975
SUV has three letters.

1704
00:54:17,976 --> 00:54:19,274
It has three letters.

1705
00:54:19,275 --> 00:54:21,174
It has more letters in Korean.

1706
00:54:21,175 --> 00:54:22,586
Sit on the floor.

1707
00:54:22,675 --> 00:54:24,444
- Sit on the floor, Se Chan. - I am an utter fool.

1708
00:54:24,445 --> 00:54:26,814
(He kicks himself.)

1709
00:54:26,815 --> 00:54:28,093
I am so annoyed.

1710
00:54:28,556 --> 00:54:29,855
- SUV. - It happens every time.

1711
00:54:29,856 --> 00:54:32,084
Even if you write it in Korean, it has five letters.

1712
00:54:32,085 --> 00:54:33,115
Get ready

1713
00:54:33,186 --> 00:54:36,833
How do you turn down the advances of someone you don't like?

1714
00:54:36,956 --> 00:54:37,955
- Sorry. - No.

1715
00:54:37,956 --> 00:54:39,955
- Okay. - My goodness.

1716
00:54:40,496 --> 00:54:42,453
What do you say when you want to go to the restroom?

1717
00:54:42,766 --> 00:54:43,964
- I want to poop. - Hey, hold on.

1718
00:54:43,965 --> 00:54:45,098
Hold on.

1719
00:54:45,666 --> 00:54:47,314
What did you say?

1720
00:54:48,306 --> 00:54:49,705
Which part of your body do you like the best?

1721
00:54:49,706 --> 00:54:51,075
- Ears. - Nostrils.

1722
00:54:51,076 --> 00:54:52,106
(Standing up)

1723
00:54:52,206 --> 00:54:54,029
- You stood up at the same time. - Haha didn't stand up.

1724
00:54:54,076 --> 00:54:55,375
- You are out. - No way.

1725
00:54:55,376 --> 00:54:56,774
You are out. Okay.

1726
00:54:56,775 --> 00:54:57,814
- Okay. - This is good.

1727
00:54:57,815 --> 00:54:59,714
Okay. I got this.

1728
00:54:59,715 --> 00:55:01,785
Since there are two people left,

1729
00:55:01,786 --> 00:55:04,484
you will alternate by adding a letter each time.

1730
00:55:04,485 --> 00:55:05,484
- Okay. - It's a death match.

1731
00:55:05,485 --> 00:55:06,584
Play rock-paper-scissors to decide who will go first.

1732
00:55:06,585 --> 00:55:08,095
- Rock-paper-scissors. - Rock-paper-scissors.

1733
00:55:08,096 --> 00:55:09,955
- They won't go beyond five letters. - It's "Dumb and Dumber".

1734
00:55:09,956 --> 00:55:12,336
It's "Dumb and Dumber". They are Fool 1 and Fool 2.

1735
00:55:12,365 --> 00:55:13,395
- Rock-paper-scissors. - Rock-paper-scissors.

1736
00:55:13,396 --> 00:55:14,464
(Kwang Soo will go first.)

1737
00:55:14,465 --> 00:55:15,702
Let's go.

1738
00:55:15,835 --> 00:55:19,030
What couldn't you say to the person next to you?

1739
00:55:19,835 --> 00:55:20,865
Hey.

1740
00:55:21,675 --> 00:55:22,705
Fool.

1741
00:55:23,576 --> 00:55:24,634
I will end you.

1742
00:55:24,635 --> 00:55:25,845
(I will end you.)

1743
00:55:25,846 --> 00:55:27,004
Their answers are becoming emotional.

1744
00:55:27,005 --> 00:55:28,274
(What couldn't you say to the person next to you?)

1745
00:55:28,275 --> 00:55:29,305
Orangutan.

1746
00:55:30,376 --> 00:55:31,550
Three.

1747
00:55:31,815 --> 00:55:32,944
Super ugly.

1748
00:55:32,945 --> 00:55:34,016
("Super ugly" has five letters in Korean.)

1749
00:55:34,545 --> 00:55:36,751
(Super ugly)

1750
00:55:37,485 --> 00:55:40,061
(He attacks Jae Seok's looks.)

1751
00:55:41,085 --> 00:55:42,294
(Flustered)

1752
00:55:42,295 --> 00:55:44,006
He doesn't know what to do.

1753
00:55:45,726 --> 00:55:46,797
Ugly.

1754
00:55:47,565 --> 00:55:49,395
- What? - You need six letters.

1755
00:55:49,396 --> 00:55:50,964
- What did he whisper? - Okay.

1756
00:55:50,965 --> 00:55:52,105
It's time for seven letters.

1757
00:55:52,106 --> 00:55:53,136
Hold on.

1758
00:55:53,606 --> 00:55:55,404
(How could you count that as an answer?)

1759
00:55:55,405 --> 00:55:56,705
How could you count that?

1760
00:55:56,706 --> 00:55:57,839
What did he say?

1761
00:55:57,976 --> 00:55:59,944
- What? - He used a swear word.

1762
00:55:59,945 --> 00:56:01,004
(Kwang Soo is annoyed.)

1763
00:56:01,005 --> 00:56:02,575
I will count that as an answer.

1764
00:56:02,576 --> 00:56:04,326
Seven letters.

1765
00:56:05,186 --> 00:56:06,345
Uglier than me.

1766
00:56:06,346 --> 00:56:07,814
(What couldn't you say to the person next to you?)

1767
00:56:07,815 --> 00:56:09,384
- He did it. - Eight letters.

1768
00:56:09,385 --> 00:56:12,654
Much uglier than Se Chan.

1769
00:56:12,655 --> 00:56:13,685
(Much uglier than Se Chan.)

1770
00:56:13,686 --> 00:56:14,933
Yes!

1771
00:56:14,996 --> 00:56:18,924
(It doesn't have the right number of letters.)

1772
00:56:18,925 --> 00:56:20,336
Yes!

1773
00:56:20,396 --> 00:56:21,895
You should have said, "Uglier than Se Chan".

1774
00:56:21,896 --> 00:56:22,926
"Uglier than Se Chan".

1775
00:56:23,295 --> 00:56:24,864
- Not "Much uglier". - Uglier...

1776
00:56:24,865 --> 00:56:26,143
than Se Chan.

1777
00:56:27,505 --> 00:56:29,639
Thus, people who will eat...

1778
00:56:29,835 --> 00:56:32,944
- are Kwang Soo, Jong Kook, Chungha, - Chungha.

1779
00:56:32,945 --> 00:56:34,475
and Jae Seok.

1780
00:56:34,476 --> 00:56:35,544
You were picked.

1781
00:56:35,545 --> 00:56:37,975
Chungha, choose the person who will pay last...

1782
00:56:37,976 --> 00:56:39,489
in this round.

1783
00:56:39,545 --> 00:56:40,987
Jong Kook has been exempt.

1784
00:56:41,556 --> 00:56:42,654
I forgot about that.

1785
00:56:42,655 --> 00:56:43,850
(Let's see.)

1786
00:56:45,485 --> 00:56:47,442
(They avoid her gaze.)

1787
00:56:48,126 --> 00:56:49,555
(Whom should I choose?)

1788
00:56:49,556 --> 00:56:51,095
I choose Se Can.

1789
00:56:51,096 --> 00:56:52,395
(I bet he has a lot of money.)

1790
00:56:52,396 --> 00:56:55,194
(She chooses Se Chan as the last person to pay.)

1791
00:56:55,195 --> 00:56:56,535
- Why? - There you go.

1792
00:56:57,295 --> 00:56:58,852
Good job.

1793
00:56:59,106 --> 00:57:01,134
- I avoided her gaze. - Se Chan will pay last...

1794
00:57:01,135 --> 00:57:02,504
in this round.

1795
00:57:02,505 --> 00:57:04,205
Beef steamed in hinoki cypress box will be served.

1796
00:57:04,206 --> 00:57:05,236
All right.

1797
00:57:05,945 --> 00:57:07,975
- It was freshly-made. - Okay.

1798
00:57:07,976 --> 00:57:09,475
(Steamed beef with the aroma of hinoki cypress)

1799
00:57:09,476 --> 00:57:10,711
Let's go.

1800
00:57:11,945 --> 00:57:13,484
This dish must be healthy.

1801
00:57:13,485 --> 00:57:15,413
We have to do something.

1802
00:57:16,215 --> 00:57:18,246
How is the soup?

1803
00:57:18,286 --> 00:57:19,418
It's like boiled meat.

1804
00:57:19,885 --> 00:57:21,285
(The 4 winners' tasty meal ends.)

1805
00:57:21,286 --> 00:57:23,151
- Is it good? - It's really good.

1806
00:57:24,126 --> 00:57:26,294
How much is the total?

1807
00:57:26,295 --> 00:57:28,194
I bet it's expensive. I bet it's about 20 dollars.

1808
00:57:28,195 --> 00:57:29,895
You finished the meal, right?

1809
00:57:29,896 --> 00:57:31,791
- Yes. - Thank you for the meal.

1810
00:57:32,005 --> 00:57:35,605
The total you must pay in this round...

1811
00:57:35,606 --> 00:57:36,935
is 19 dollars.

1812
00:57:36,936 --> 00:57:39,805
(The total is 19 dollars.)

1813
00:57:39,806 --> 00:57:43,444
(10 people must divide the total of 19 dollars.)

1814
00:57:43,445 --> 00:57:45,403
This is tricky.

1815
00:57:46,085 --> 00:57:47,527
If each person pays 2 dollars, the total will be 20 dollars.

1816
00:57:47,846 --> 00:57:49,084
Who will pay a dollar?

1817
00:57:49,085 --> 00:57:50,805
Someone won't pay.

1818
00:57:51,215 --> 00:57:53,584
You will be at risk if you only pay a dollar.

1819
00:57:53,585 --> 00:57:54,760
Keep that in mind.

1820
00:57:55,295 --> 00:57:57,459
There is no way someone will forgo a payment.

1821
00:57:57,655 --> 00:57:58,829
Who wants to go first?

1822
00:57:59,626 --> 00:58:01,194
- Haha. - Okay.

1823
00:58:01,195 --> 00:58:03,294
(The first person to pay is Haha.)

1824
00:58:03,295 --> 00:58:05,705
- I don't know. - Paying a dollar is risky.

1825
00:58:05,706 --> 00:58:06,900
(Haha, pay a lot.)

1826
00:58:07,965 --> 00:58:10,037
I think it will go over the bill.

1827
00:58:10,536 --> 00:58:13,533
I think it will go over the bill.

1828
00:58:13,905 --> 00:58:15,814
Then it doesn't matter who paid the least, right?

1829
00:58:15,815 --> 00:58:16,975
(The final amount could go over the bill.)

1830
00:58:16,976 --> 00:58:19,798
Your heart will be at ease if you pay three dollars.

1831
00:58:19,945 --> 00:58:21,810
Paying a dollar is risky.

1832
00:58:21,856 --> 00:58:24,359
Forgoing a payment can go either way.

1833
00:58:26,186 --> 00:58:27,225
I will forgo a payment.

1834
00:58:27,226 --> 00:58:29,855
(I will forgo a payment.)

1835
00:58:29,856 --> 00:58:31,395
(Thinking that the final amount will go over the bill,)

1836
00:58:31,396 --> 00:58:32,395
I think it will go over.

1837
00:58:32,396 --> 00:58:33,825
(Haha forgoes a payment.)

1838
00:58:33,826 --> 00:58:34,896
All right.

1839
00:58:36,465 --> 00:58:37,665
I will forgo a payment.

1840
00:58:37,666 --> 00:58:40,364
(I will forgo a payment.)

1841
00:58:40,365 --> 00:58:44,600
(Kwang Soo also forgoes a payment.)

1842
00:58:44,835 --> 00:58:46,475
It's best to put your heart at ease.

1843
00:58:46,476 --> 00:58:48,226
- It's your turn. - Okay.

1844
00:58:48,275 --> 00:58:49,409
It's best to put your heart at ease.

1845
00:58:49,976 --> 00:58:51,745
His action will be the opposite of his words.

1846
00:58:51,746 --> 00:58:52,984
I think...

1847
00:58:52,985 --> 00:58:55,285
You could either split the remaining amount...

1848
00:58:55,286 --> 00:58:56,785
as the last member to pay or...

1849
00:58:56,786 --> 00:58:58,785
Even if I take the leftover money as the member who paid the most,

1850
00:58:58,786 --> 00:59:00,084
the money I lose will be about the same.

1851
00:59:00,085 --> 00:59:03,225
I could take the leftover money as the member who paid the most.

1852
00:59:03,226 --> 00:59:05,995
- That's right. - Or I could make the member...

1853
00:59:05,996 --> 00:59:08,095
who paid the least split the remaining amount with me.

1854
00:59:08,096 --> 00:59:10,964
- Why are you pointing at me? - I am sorry.

1855
00:59:10,965 --> 00:59:12,705
(Why are you pointing at me?)

1856
00:59:12,706 --> 00:59:15,105
I am sorry. I am sorry.

1857
00:59:15,106 --> 00:59:16,205
- Me? - It's nothing.

1858
00:59:16,206 --> 00:59:17,475
- The target has been decided. - Yes.

1859
00:59:17,476 --> 00:59:20,274
- You want to make him pay, right? - Whoever paid the least...

1860
00:59:20,275 --> 00:59:22,174
How much should I pay?

1861
00:59:22,175 --> 00:59:25,944
(Their war of nerves becomes fiercer since the bill is small.)

1862
00:59:25,945 --> 00:59:29,006
(Everyone makes some calculations and pays.)

1863
00:59:29,215 --> 00:59:32,125
My bet was off the last time.

1864
00:59:32,126 --> 00:59:33,804
I will raise the money by two times...

1865
00:59:34,286 --> 00:59:35,595
and pay 10 dollars.

1866
00:59:35,596 --> 00:59:36,790
- 10 dollars. - Yes.

1867
00:59:38,525 --> 00:59:40,997
I will bet more daringly. I regretted my earlier decision.

1868
00:59:41,396 --> 00:59:43,294
(In Ah aims to be the member who paid the most.)

1869
00:59:43,295 --> 00:59:44,935
I am cool with this.

1870
00:59:44,936 --> 00:59:46,244
Thank you.

1871
00:59:47,806 --> 00:59:50,247
The amount of money I lose will be about the same.

1872
00:59:50,536 --> 00:59:53,565
(Paying the most amount of money versus paying enough)

1873
00:59:53,606 --> 00:59:56,460
(What will be Se Chan's choice?)

1874
00:59:56,815 --> 00:59:58,444
- All right. Let's go. - Let's go.

1875
00:59:58,445 --> 00:59:59,785
- Let's go. - Let's move on.

1876
00:59:59,786 --> 01:00:00,785
(Payment has been made.)

1877
01:00:00,786 --> 01:00:02,536
- All right. - What's the result?

1878
01:00:03,085 --> 01:00:06,384
I told you that the amount you have to pay is...

1879
01:00:06,385 --> 01:00:08,560
19 dollars.

1880
01:00:08,596 --> 01:00:11,172
The total amount that you paid is...

1881
01:00:12,065 --> 01:00:13,964
(If it's not enough,)

1882
01:00:13,965 --> 01:00:15,834
(the last and the one who paid the least pay the rest.)

1883
01:00:15,835 --> 01:00:17,464
(How much did 10 people pay?)

1884
01:00:17,465 --> 01:00:18,665
It's 29 dollars.

1885
01:00:18,666 --> 01:00:21,234
(29 dollars)

1886
01:00:21,235 --> 01:00:23,674
(It's 10 dollars more than what they owe.)

1887
01:00:23,675 --> 01:00:25,205
- Who is it? - 29 dollars?

1888
01:00:25,206 --> 01:00:26,575
- Who paid that much? - Why?

1889
01:00:26,576 --> 01:00:28,544
Someone paid a lot to win.

1890
01:00:28,545 --> 01:00:30,674
- Someone wanted to take it all. - It's a competition.

1891
01:00:30,675 --> 01:00:32,086
The winner takes 10 dollars.

1892
01:00:32,186 --> 01:00:34,483
- The ones who paid the most are... - Who is it?

1893
01:00:35,115 --> 01:00:36,558
- In Ah... - What?

1894
01:00:36,615 --> 01:00:37,814
and Ji Hyo.

1895
01:00:37,815 --> 01:00:41,484
(In Ah and Ji Hyo paid the highest amount.)

1896
01:00:41,485 --> 01:00:43,145
You may take five dollars each.

1897
01:00:43,226 --> 01:00:44,424
- It's a loss. - It's both of them.

1898
01:00:44,425 --> 01:00:46,395
It's a loss for them.

1899
01:00:46,396 --> 01:00:48,765
(They pay 10 dollars and lose 5 dollars.)

1900
01:00:48,766 --> 01:00:50,856
It's a loss.

1901
01:00:52,106 --> 01:00:53,205
(It's time for Ji Hyo to pay.)

1902
01:00:53,206 --> 01:00:54,564
It's either the winner or the loser.

1903
01:00:54,565 --> 01:00:56,375
(She paid nothing in Round 1.)

1904
01:00:56,376 --> 01:00:57,776
I'll pay 10 dollars.

1905
01:00:59,405 --> 01:01:00,745
(The least in Round 1 and the most in Round 2)

1906
01:01:00,746 --> 01:01:02,044
(Ji Hyo pays extreme amounts.)

1907
01:01:02,045 --> 01:01:03,714
- Did you think that only you won? - Yes.

1908
01:01:03,715 --> 01:01:05,015
(In Ah also makes a loss.)

1909
01:01:05,016 --> 01:01:06,245
The one who paid the least must be excited.

1910
01:01:06,246 --> 01:01:08,171
It's a gain for those who didn't pay.

1911
01:01:08,215 --> 01:01:09,415
Let's go.

1912
01:01:09,416 --> 01:01:10,484
(Is he admitting that he paid nothing?)

1913
01:01:10,485 --> 01:01:11,754
They didn't pay.

1914
01:01:11,755 --> 01:01:13,475
- They didn't pay. - They didn't.

1915
01:01:14,155 --> 01:01:16,555
- Let's go to the next place. - Okay.

1916
01:01:16,556 --> 01:01:17,924
(Payment has been made.)

1917
01:01:17,925 --> 01:01:19,024
(They go to eat their last invigorating food.)

1918
01:01:19,025 --> 01:01:22,229
(The members' current amount of money)

1919
01:01:22,266 --> 01:01:24,048
By the way,

1920
01:01:24,766 --> 01:01:26,454
did In Ah and Ji Hyo pay 10 dollars each?

1921
01:01:26,905 --> 01:01:28,831
- Yes. - You risked it to win.

1922
01:01:29,106 --> 01:01:32,274
- There must be two who didn't pay. - I know.

1923
01:01:32,275 --> 01:01:34,232
- They're so bold. - "Bold"?

1924
01:01:34,346 --> 01:01:37,145
- Unless you're very bold... - It must be Bold Kwang.

1925
01:01:37,146 --> 01:01:38,865
- It must be Bold Kwang. - It must be Bold Kwang.

1926
01:01:38,916 --> 01:01:40,345
"Bold Kwang".

1927
01:01:40,346 --> 01:01:41,902
- It's not me. - It's Bold Kwang.

1928
01:01:42,556 --> 01:01:43,754
(The victims of Bold Kwang)

1929
01:01:43,755 --> 01:01:44,919
I'm in trouble.

1930
01:01:44,956 --> 01:01:46,913
I want to eat neungi mushrooms no matter what.

1931
01:01:47,155 --> 01:01:49,725
Seok Jin, if you unclear the mission and don't get to eat again,

1932
01:01:49,726 --> 01:01:51,198
- you'll be in trouble. - I'll win.

1933
01:01:51,525 --> 01:01:52,825
If Seok Jin doesn't eat again,

1934
01:01:52,826 --> 01:01:54,236
he's on a sporadic diet.

1935
01:01:55,365 --> 01:01:57,095
(Seok Jin is on a sporadic diet.)

1936
01:01:57,096 --> 01:01:58,755
I'm famished.

1937
01:01:59,166 --> 01:02:00,474
I'll win no matter what.

1938
01:02:00,735 --> 01:02:02,075
Will you really win?

1939
01:02:02,076 --> 01:02:03,548
"Sporadic diet".

1940
01:02:05,545 --> 01:02:07,174
We'll be arriving soon.

1941
01:02:07,175 --> 01:02:09,101
The restaurant is small.

1942
01:02:09,115 --> 01:02:11,897
Only two of you will get out and bring takeout.

1943
01:02:12,545 --> 01:02:14,084
- Who will the two be? - How about...

1944
01:02:14,085 --> 01:02:15,285
we play a game?

1945
01:02:15,286 --> 01:02:16,758
Those who are in love should go.

1946
01:02:17,056 --> 01:02:18,147
"Those who are in love"?

1947
01:02:18,255 --> 01:02:20,024
Seok Jin and So Min.

1948
01:02:20,025 --> 01:02:22,455
(All of a sudden?)

1949
01:02:22,456 --> 01:02:23,995
Isn't it him and Ji Hyo?

1950
01:02:23,996 --> 01:02:26,024
(Fantastic water gun romance)

1951
01:02:26,025 --> 01:02:27,595
- Were you startled? - Seok Jin and So Min?

1952
01:02:27,596 --> 01:02:28,834
- It was out of the blue. - Why did you undo your seatbelt?

1953
01:02:28,835 --> 01:02:30,064
Why did you undo your seatbelt?

1954
01:02:30,065 --> 01:02:31,539
(He's trying to get off.)

1955
01:02:31,835 --> 01:02:33,411
- Seok Jin and So Min. - That's nonsense.

1956
01:02:33,706 --> 01:02:35,076
They look good together.

1957
01:02:35,275 --> 01:02:36,575
Goodness.

1958
01:02:36,576 --> 01:02:39,152
So Min hopes for romance.

1959
01:02:39,806 --> 01:02:41,393
- My goodness. - Anyway...

1960
01:02:42,115 --> 01:02:44,650
- Let's go. - Here it is. It looks delicious.

1961
01:02:45,016 --> 01:02:46,324
There it is.

1962
01:02:46,385 --> 01:02:48,044
- There it is. - It's the payment.

1963
01:02:48,045 --> 01:02:49,632
It's here too. Hello.

1964
01:02:49,655 --> 01:02:51,098
Hello.

1965
01:02:51,255 --> 01:02:53,055
May we order a takeout?

1966
01:02:53,056 --> 01:02:54,220
May we come in?

1967
01:02:54,326 --> 01:02:55,595
Is it already packed?

1968
01:02:55,596 --> 01:02:57,038
- Yes. - Thank you.

1969
01:02:57,295 --> 01:02:58,944
It looks delicious.

1970
01:02:58,996 --> 01:03:00,095
It's neungi mushrooms.

1971
01:03:00,096 --> 01:03:01,641
(Boiled chicken with neungi mushrooms)

1972
01:03:02,036 --> 01:03:03,096
This is amazing.

1973
01:03:03,235 --> 01:03:05,266
I'll pay with zero pay.

1974
01:03:05,865 --> 01:03:06,968
It worked.

1975
01:03:07,106 --> 01:03:08,674
- It worked. - Thank you.

1976
01:03:08,675 --> 01:03:10,797
- Thank you. - Did the payment go through?

1977
01:03:11,175 --> 01:03:14,061
It's made with herbal medicine.

1978
01:03:14,476 --> 01:03:17,020
You'll feel a lot of strength after eating this.

1979
01:03:17,576 --> 01:03:19,345
Eat this and get strength.

1980
01:03:19,346 --> 01:03:20,345
- Okay. - Thank you.

1981
01:03:20,346 --> 01:03:21,645
Please stay strong, Sir.

1982
01:03:21,646 --> 01:03:22,915
- Stay strong. - Thank you.

1983
01:03:22,916 --> 01:03:24,015
Thank you.

1984
01:03:24,016 --> 01:03:25,524
- Thank you for the food. - We'll be back.

1985
01:03:25,525 --> 01:03:26,825
- Stay strong, Sir. - Goodbye.

1986
01:03:26,826 --> 01:03:29,814
(They obtain boiled chicken with neungi mushrooms.)

1987
01:03:31,056 --> 01:03:33,084
This is incredible. What's this?

1988
01:03:33,126 --> 01:03:34,300
What?

1989
01:03:34,425 --> 01:03:35,599
What's this?

1990
01:03:35,996 --> 01:03:37,064
What's this?

1991
01:03:37,065 --> 01:03:38,495
Did this place exist before?

1992
01:03:38,496 --> 01:03:39,734
(It's a grand and circular stadium.)

1993
01:03:39,735 --> 01:03:41,558
- It's great here. - What's that?

1994
01:03:42,275 --> 01:03:43,676
It's soccer, Jong Kook.

1995
01:03:43,905 --> 01:03:45,699
I think we have to kick it and attach it.

1996
01:03:47,246 --> 01:03:49,543
"Dye hair with color spray, squeaky hammer".

1997
01:03:49,945 --> 01:03:51,182
What's this?

1998
01:03:52,146 --> 01:03:54,248
This is the final mission for boiled chicken with neungi mushrooms...

1999
01:03:54,545 --> 01:03:56,685
and the order of payment.

2000
01:03:56,686 --> 01:03:58,154
It's called Soccer King Shutdolyi.

2001
01:03:58,155 --> 01:04:00,154
(Soccer King Shutdolyi)

2002
01:04:00,155 --> 01:04:01,725
- "Soccer King Shutdolyi". - Shutdolyi.

2003
01:04:01,726 --> 01:04:03,816
It's an individual game.

2004
01:04:03,826 --> 01:04:06,855
A person will kick the ball towards the target.

2005
01:04:07,126 --> 01:04:10,329
You succeed if you attach the ball to the center.

2006
01:04:11,436 --> 01:04:13,305
The one who succeeds first...

2007
01:04:13,306 --> 01:04:15,334
gets the right to choose the loser...

2008
01:04:15,335 --> 01:04:16,818
and two people to eat with.

2009
01:04:17,706 --> 01:04:20,074
I really want some boiled chicken this time.

2010
01:04:20,646 --> 01:04:22,975
If the ball is attached to the penalty area,

2011
01:04:22,976 --> 01:04:26,944
you get a penalty from the person who went before you.

2012
01:04:26,945 --> 01:04:29,594
"Dye hair with color spray" is the worst.

2013
01:04:29,755 --> 01:04:31,114
You can't wash it off immediately.

2014
01:04:31,115 --> 01:04:32,185
It doesn't wash off easily.

2015
01:04:32,186 --> 01:04:33,565
Please start.

2016
01:04:33,755 --> 01:04:35,754
- Who's next? - It's So Min.

2017
01:04:35,755 --> 01:04:38,024
(So Min is up next.)

2018
01:04:38,025 --> 01:04:39,694
She's fast.

2019
01:04:39,695 --> 01:04:41,415
She's definitely fast.

2020
01:04:41,795 --> 01:04:43,589
You're so fast that I can't see you.

2021
01:04:44,735 --> 01:04:45,935
Let's go, So Min.

2022
01:04:45,936 --> 01:04:47,552
I hope it's attached in one try.

2023
01:04:47,806 --> 01:04:48,875
Kick.

2024
01:04:48,876 --> 01:04:50,864
(Will her warming up be effective?)

2025
01:04:51,135 --> 01:04:52,145
(It's attached right away.)

2026
01:04:52,146 --> 01:04:53,544
- "Put on a funny hat". - "Put on a funny hat".

2027
01:04:53,545 --> 01:04:55,884
That's a relief.

2028
01:04:55,976 --> 01:04:57,375
- That's a relief. - That isn't bad.

2029
01:04:57,376 --> 01:04:58,612
It's a relief.

2030
01:04:58,885 --> 01:05:00,018
This is great.

2031
01:05:00,445 --> 01:05:01,584
How about this?

2032
01:05:01,585 --> 01:05:03,337
- How about a swimming cap? - How about this?

2033
01:05:04,016 --> 01:05:05,468
Se Chan is an expert in this.

2034
01:05:07,085 --> 01:05:08,584
(The work of a master of makeup)

2035
01:05:08,585 --> 01:05:09,760
Wait.

2036
01:05:10,326 --> 01:05:14,415
Look at the back of So Min's head. Is she really okay?

2037
01:05:14,596 --> 01:05:16,492
Look at the back of her head.

2038
01:05:16,795 --> 01:05:17,964
Is she really okay?

2039
01:05:17,965 --> 01:05:19,734
How can the back of your head be so flat?

2040
01:05:19,735 --> 01:05:20,805
(Is this look real?)

2041
01:05:20,806 --> 01:05:22,834
It looks like a thumb in a thimble.

2042
01:05:22,835 --> 01:05:24,435
(How does it look?)

2043
01:05:24,436 --> 01:05:25,845
- I can't see. - Next is In Ah.

2044
01:05:25,846 --> 01:05:27,105
(We're glad that you can't see.)

2045
01:05:27,106 --> 01:05:29,516
I hope I don't get "put on a funny hat".

2046
01:05:30,076 --> 01:05:31,745
Next is In Ah. She's good.

2047
01:05:31,746 --> 01:05:33,314
- She's athletic. - Looks good.

2048
01:05:33,315 --> 01:05:36,200
(What will be the result for In Ah?)

2049
01:05:37,916 --> 01:05:40,024
(It heads towards the center.)

2050
01:05:40,025 --> 01:05:41,055
"Put on a funny hat".

2051
01:05:41,056 --> 01:05:42,879
("Put on a funny hat")

2052
01:05:43,425 --> 01:05:44,524
(I'm doomed.)

2053
01:05:44,525 --> 01:05:46,761
- It's the thing she didn't want. - Put it on.

2054
01:05:47,195 --> 01:05:48,265
Is it me?

2055
01:05:48,266 --> 01:05:49,367
Is it me?

2056
01:05:49,735 --> 01:05:51,435
How about a matching hat with mine?

2057
01:05:51,436 --> 01:05:52,935
Is this the same hat?

2058
01:05:52,936 --> 01:05:54,377
It looks good on In Ah.

2059
01:05:54,465 --> 01:05:55,610
Let's see.

2060
01:05:56,476 --> 01:05:58,745
(Does it look good on me?)

2061
01:05:58,746 --> 01:05:59,745
Look at her hair.

2062
01:05:59,746 --> 01:06:00,940
What happened to her hair?

2063
01:06:01,505 --> 01:06:02,886
What did you do to her hair?

2064
01:06:03,016 --> 01:06:05,828
So Min gets high-handed whenever we have actresses.

2065
01:06:06,585 --> 01:06:07,745
Is this necessary?

2066
01:06:07,746 --> 01:06:09,685
(They both look like Hulk.)

2067
01:06:09,686 --> 01:06:10,953
That's great.

2068
01:06:11,416 --> 01:06:12,517
You look good.

2069
01:06:12,655 --> 01:06:13,717
You look good together.

2070
01:06:13,885 --> 01:06:15,595
Do we have to target the center?

2071
01:06:15,596 --> 01:06:17,194
(No one could avoid penalties.)

2072
01:06:17,195 --> 01:06:19,329
(Will anyone succeed?)

2073
01:06:19,565 --> 01:06:20,864
(Next player is Jae Seok.)

2074
01:06:21,365 --> 01:06:23,291
(What's the result?)

2075
01:06:23,465 --> 01:06:24,935
(Attached)

2076
01:06:24,936 --> 01:06:27,099
- "Put on a funny hat". - "Put on a funny hat".

2077
01:06:27,135 --> 01:06:28,364
What funny hats are there?

2078
01:06:28,365 --> 01:06:29,776
- This is the only one. - The yellow swimming cap?

2079
01:06:30,005 --> 01:06:31,134
This is it.

2080
01:06:31,135 --> 01:06:33,166
- This is it. - That's right.

2081
01:06:34,775 --> 01:06:36,362
What? You startled me.

2082
01:06:36,815 --> 01:06:38,075
- What? - What's this?

2083
01:06:38,076 --> 01:06:39,944
(What did Kwang Soo see?)

2084
01:06:39,945 --> 01:06:42,285
(He makes everyone burst into laughter.)

2085
01:06:42,286 --> 01:06:44,625
(He's coming.)

2086
01:06:45,485 --> 01:06:47,957
(The front of his face is compressed.)

2087
01:06:48,525 --> 01:06:49,967
What? You startled me.

2088
01:06:50,326 --> 01:06:51,737
- What? - What's this?

2089
01:06:51,995 --> 01:06:53,365
Is he human?

2090
01:06:53,366 --> 01:06:54,457
It's a monster.

2091
01:06:55,465 --> 01:06:56,908
It's an alien.

2092
01:06:57,295 --> 01:06:58,810
- Is he? - Can you see?

2093
01:06:58,906 --> 01:07:00,765
In Ah screamed.

2094
01:07:00,766 --> 01:07:02,235
(The makeup turns him into something of a different race.)

2095
01:07:02,236 --> 01:07:03,674
Shouldn't I be able to see?

2096
01:07:03,675 --> 01:07:05,766
This is what this hat looks like.

2097
01:07:05,806 --> 01:07:07,145
This is funny.

2098
01:07:07,146 --> 01:07:09,588
- Shouldn't you look like me? - I didn't know.

2099
01:07:09,745 --> 01:07:10,945
Can you see, Jae Seok?

2100
01:07:10,946 --> 01:07:12,145
- Hey. - His eyes.

2101
01:07:12,146 --> 01:07:14,084
- His eyes look charismatic. - Jae Seok.

2102
01:07:14,085 --> 01:07:15,703
You look like a good fighter.

2103
01:07:16,056 --> 01:07:18,584
He looks similar to Myung Soo.

2104
01:07:18,585 --> 01:07:20,324
- It's Park Myung Soo. - "Don't touch me."

2105
01:07:20,325 --> 01:07:21,485
He looks like him.

2106
01:07:21,486 --> 01:07:22,824
(He's possessed by Myung Soo.)

2107
01:07:22,825 --> 01:07:24,025
- "Don't touch me!" - He looks just like him.

2108
01:07:24,026 --> 01:07:25,794
- It's Park Myung Soo. - "Shut it."

2109
01:07:25,795 --> 01:07:27,225
- "Shut it." - He looks so similar.

2110
01:07:27,226 --> 01:07:29,328
- Here I go. - You look like him.

2111
01:07:29,366 --> 01:07:31,394
(Next up is Haha.)

2112
01:07:31,965 --> 01:07:33,365
It's "put on a funny hat".

2113
01:07:33,366 --> 01:07:34,745
Why do we get that so many times?

2114
01:07:35,266 --> 01:07:36,975
(It's the funny hat penalty again.)

2115
01:07:36,976 --> 01:07:38,211
We should put them on as a group.

2116
01:07:38,276 --> 01:07:39,306
Okay.

2117
01:07:39,575 --> 01:07:40,945
(People keep putting hats on.)

2118
01:07:40,946 --> 01:07:42,593
You look like Myung Soo too.

2119
01:07:43,875 --> 01:07:45,015
"What are you looking at?"

2120
01:07:45,016 --> 01:07:46,145
(Possessed by Myung Soo)

2121
01:07:46,146 --> 01:07:48,175
- "What are you looking at?" - How many Myung Soos are there?

2122
01:07:49,316 --> 01:07:51,315
- "Hey." - "This looks fun."

2123
01:07:51,316 --> 01:07:52,458
"Watch what you say."

2124
01:07:52,656 --> 01:07:53,924
(It's hard to look at them.)

2125
01:07:53,925 --> 01:07:55,574
- "Close your mouth." - Okay.

2126
01:07:55,896 --> 01:07:57,543
How many Myung Soos are there?

2127
01:07:57,955 --> 01:08:00,161
- They look so scary. - "Hurry up and play."

2128
01:08:01,026 --> 01:08:02,395
(What on earth?)

2129
01:08:02,396 --> 01:08:03,435
"Doodle for three seconds".

2130
01:08:03,436 --> 01:08:04,877
(People keep getting a penalty.)

2131
01:08:05,165 --> 01:08:06,885
- Ji Hyo is angry. - She's angry.

2132
01:08:07,205 --> 01:08:08,365
- Ji Hyo. - What's wrong?

2133
01:08:08,366 --> 01:08:10,275
(They get a penalty every time they kick.)

2134
01:08:10,276 --> 01:08:11,676
- "Doodle on the face". - "For three seconds".

2135
01:08:11,875 --> 01:08:13,044
She looks like Woong's father.

2136
01:08:13,045 --> 01:08:14,621
(Woong's father appears.)

2137
01:08:14,776 --> 01:08:16,053
The concept of your new performance is sensational.

2138
01:08:16,575 --> 01:08:17,812
She almost had it.

2139
01:08:17,846 --> 01:08:19,020
If only it went to the side...

2140
01:08:19,486 --> 01:08:21,044
- Congratulations, Chungha. - You look pretty.

2141
01:08:21,045 --> 01:08:22,214
You look like The Statue of Liberty.

2142
01:08:22,215 --> 01:08:23,658
(She keeps her pretty looks.)

2143
01:08:24,156 --> 01:08:25,254
Here I go.

2144
01:08:25,255 --> 01:08:27,124
(People keep getting makeup as they play.)

2145
01:08:27,125 --> 01:08:28,284
Color spray.

2146
01:08:28,285 --> 01:08:29,799
Please stop spraying on my hair.

2147
01:08:30,096 --> 01:08:31,124
(Is it possible to succeed?)

2148
01:08:31,125 --> 01:08:32,259
He looks like a grass doll.

2149
01:08:33,066 --> 01:08:34,464
- He has become a hipster. - That looks good.

2150
01:08:34,465 --> 01:08:36,034
- Do I look like a hipster? - Seriously.

2151
01:08:36,035 --> 01:08:37,195
- You look good. - Do I?

2152
01:08:37,196 --> 01:08:39,638
- You look amazing. - You look like a celebrity.

2153
01:08:39,665 --> 01:08:41,665
- Look at him. - Now I look like a celebrity.

2154
01:08:41,936 --> 01:08:42,935
They look good on you.

2155
01:08:42,936 --> 01:08:44,305
I only put on a pair of sunglasses.

2156
01:08:44,306 --> 01:08:45,645
- All right. - This is great.

2157
01:08:46,146 --> 01:08:47,825
Please attach it to the center.

2158
01:08:48,306 --> 01:08:50,874
(Something makes him look pathetic.)

2159
01:08:50,875 --> 01:08:51,975
Can you see?

2160
01:08:51,976 --> 01:08:54,521
- Isn't there a similar emoji? - Yes.

2161
01:08:54,545 --> 01:08:56,155
- He looks so funny. - This is it.

2162
01:08:56,156 --> 01:08:57,392
- His face looks familiar. - Isn't there the same thing?

2163
01:08:58,116 --> 01:08:59,754
There's an emoticon with glasses on.

2164
01:08:59,755 --> 01:09:01,300
- Get out of my way. - He looks the same.

2165
01:09:01,325 --> 01:09:02,424
You can do it.

2166
01:09:02,425 --> 01:09:04,382
(He kicks the ball without expecting much.)

2167
01:09:04,696 --> 01:09:06,066
(Attached)

2168
01:09:06,325 --> 01:09:08,385
(It's attached in the center.)

2169
01:09:09,896 --> 01:09:11,095
(Is this possible?)

2170
01:09:11,096 --> 01:09:12,301
- He did it. - Success.

2171
01:09:13,106 --> 01:09:15,674
(The soccer ball is attached to the center like a magnet.)

2172
01:09:15,675 --> 01:09:18,179
(Jae Seok succeeds.)

2173
01:09:18,675 --> 01:09:20,345
(He made it with the power of compressed face.)

2174
01:09:20,346 --> 01:09:21,850
- Goodness. - What's this?

2175
01:09:21,946 --> 01:09:22,975
What?

2176
01:09:22,976 --> 01:09:25,418
He knows how to hit the target.

2177
01:09:25,545 --> 01:09:26,584
What?

2178
01:09:26,585 --> 01:09:28,044
(The final winner is Jae Seok.)

2179
01:09:28,045 --> 01:09:30,115
As the winner, Jae Seok will pick two...

2180
01:09:30,116 --> 01:09:31,835
to share boiled chicken with neungi mushrooms.

2181
01:09:32,686 --> 01:09:35,363
- Two? - Jae Seok, So Min and I haven't...

2182
01:09:35,486 --> 01:09:37,279
- eaten today. - You haven't?

2183
01:09:37,325 --> 01:09:38,754
- Neither has Seok Jin. - Me neither.

2184
01:09:38,755 --> 01:09:40,164
- Who hasn't eaten yet? - Me.

2185
01:09:40,165 --> 01:09:41,567
- Me. - There are three.

2186
01:09:41,995 --> 01:09:44,469
So Min, Seok Jin, and Ji Hyo.

2187
01:09:44,696 --> 01:09:46,003
I'll eat it with Ji Hyo and So Min.

2188
01:09:47,366 --> 01:09:48,365
Hey.

2189
01:09:48,366 --> 01:09:49,539
(He picks Ji Hyo and So Min.)

2190
01:09:50,135 --> 01:09:51,805
(Why did you even ask me?)

2191
01:09:51,806 --> 01:09:53,011
- Hey. - Seok Jin can't eat again?

2192
01:09:53,306 --> 01:09:54,480
I can't eat again?

2193
01:09:54,745 --> 01:09:59,515
When you pay, pick a member who will pay last.

2194
01:09:59,516 --> 01:10:01,185
- The one who'll pay last? - Yes.

2195
01:10:01,186 --> 01:10:02,954
(Slowly walking away)

2196
01:10:02,955 --> 01:10:04,428
You haven't eaten, Seok Jin, have you?

2197
01:10:05,986 --> 01:10:07,725
(Let's talk for a minute.)

2198
01:10:07,726 --> 01:10:10,168
It's okay. Don't worry about me.

2199
01:10:10,425 --> 01:10:11,940
You don't have to care about me.

2200
01:10:11,955 --> 01:10:13,395
Why do you care?

2201
01:10:13,396 --> 01:10:15,281
- I'll pick Seok Jin. - Goodness.

2202
01:10:16,096 --> 01:10:17,964
(Seok Jin will pay.)

2203
01:10:17,965 --> 01:10:19,204
Why?

2204
01:10:19,205 --> 01:10:20,235
(Without eating boiled chicken, Seok Jin pays.)

2205
01:10:20,236 --> 01:10:22,017
After the meal, we'll have the last payment time.

2206
01:10:22,135 --> 01:10:24,401
- Then we'll wrap up. - Okay.

2207
01:10:24,535 --> 01:10:25,744
Let's move.

2208
01:10:25,745 --> 01:10:27,456
I can't believe that I hit it.

2209
01:10:28,045 --> 01:10:29,724
I can smell food.

2210
01:10:30,915 --> 01:10:33,522
It looks so delicious.

2211
01:10:33,846 --> 01:10:35,315
I wanted to eat it.

2212
01:10:35,316 --> 01:10:37,155
(It's a table full of healthy food.)

2213
01:10:37,156 --> 01:10:38,655
It's invigorating food.

2214
01:10:38,656 --> 01:10:41,364
- Look at that. - It's made with neungi mushrooms.

2215
01:10:41,385 --> 01:10:42,591
It looks amazing.

2216
01:10:43,255 --> 01:10:44,655
The broth is great.

2217
01:10:44,656 --> 01:10:46,065
(The taste of healthy food is impressive.)

2218
01:10:46,066 --> 01:10:47,507
The broth is delicious.

2219
01:10:48,325 --> 01:10:50,565
I want to try some broth.

2220
01:10:50,566 --> 01:10:52,464
That's invigorating food.

2221
01:10:52,465 --> 01:10:54,216
We should eat it on a hot day.

2222
01:10:54,366 --> 01:10:56,704
Didn't you say that you'll show us?

2223
01:10:56,705 --> 01:10:57,767
(Didn't you say that you'll show us?)

2224
01:10:58,005 --> 01:10:59,074
- What? - What?

2225
01:10:59,075 --> 01:11:00,345
You said that you'll show us waacking.

2226
01:11:00,346 --> 01:11:02,044
- Right. - Show it to us properly.

2227
01:11:02,045 --> 01:11:03,044
- Show us properly. - That's right.

2228
01:11:03,045 --> 01:11:05,074
If you show us waacking, I'll give you some.

2229
01:11:05,075 --> 01:11:06,185
Chungha and In Ah.

2230
01:11:06,186 --> 01:11:07,865
- If they dance, is it for free? - Yes.

2231
01:11:08,045 --> 01:11:09,396
Come out.

2232
01:11:09,816 --> 01:11:10,855
Come out.

2233
01:11:10,856 --> 01:11:12,324
(Let's dance and eat boiled chicken with neungi mushrooms.)

2234
01:11:12,325 --> 01:11:14,138
I'm sorry, but I don't know waacking.

2235
01:11:14,486 --> 01:11:15,835
Just dance.

2236
01:11:15,925 --> 01:11:17,395
I wonder what music will play.

2237
01:11:17,396 --> 01:11:18,868
What's the basic move?

2238
01:11:18,995 --> 01:11:20,572
Just turn the arms.

2239
01:11:20,625 --> 01:11:21,934
Isn't this...

2240
01:11:22,566 --> 01:11:24,286
(However)

2241
01:11:24,335 --> 01:11:26,704
(The beat is familiar.)

2242
01:11:26,705 --> 01:11:30,004
- I know this dance. - This is the song for our dance.

2243
01:11:30,005 --> 01:11:31,634
(It's the song for their group dance at their fan-meet.)

2244
01:11:31,635 --> 01:11:32,905
What is it?

2245
01:11:32,906 --> 01:11:36,006
(What kind of dance will they show?)

2246
01:11:36,575 --> 01:11:38,575
(Chungha starts.)

2247
01:11:40,085 --> 01:11:41,985
(Explosive with power)

2248
01:11:41,986 --> 01:11:43,458
I can't do that.

2249
01:11:44,215 --> 01:11:45,454
(She breaks the beat for boiled chicken.)

2250
01:11:45,455 --> 01:11:46,725
Is this waacking?

2251
01:11:46,726 --> 01:11:48,405
She's a good dancer.

2252
01:11:49,056 --> 01:11:50,981
(So this is waacking.)

2253
01:11:52,156 --> 01:11:53,711
I can't do that.

2254
01:11:54,026 --> 01:11:55,464
What's with her?

2255
01:11:55,465 --> 01:11:56,494
Unbelievable.

2256
01:11:56,495 --> 01:11:57,875
She dances well.

2257
01:11:57,995 --> 01:11:59,034
It's incredible.

2258
01:11:59,035 --> 01:12:01,095
(Her arms and legs move on their own.)

2259
01:12:01,936 --> 01:12:04,275
She's dancing without thinking, but she looks better than us.

2260
01:12:04,276 --> 01:12:06,718
(She's dancing without thinking, but she looks better than us.)

2261
01:12:08,306 --> 01:12:09,975
She's dancing without thinking, but she looks much better.

2262
01:12:09,976 --> 01:12:11,902
(Chungha's fantastic solo dance)

2263
01:12:11,946 --> 01:12:13,325
Good job.

2264
01:12:13,486 --> 01:12:15,577
- That was amazing. - Okay.

2265
01:12:15,715 --> 01:12:16,714
(Speechless)

2266
01:12:16,715 --> 01:12:18,641
We practiced for several days,

2267
01:12:18,816 --> 01:12:20,355
but we can't dance like her.

2268
01:12:20,356 --> 01:12:22,324
Did you give her the song in advance?

2269
01:12:22,325 --> 01:12:24,124
What? How do you dance so well?

2270
01:12:24,125 --> 01:12:25,599
I danced however I wanted.

2271
01:12:25,866 --> 01:12:27,865
It was freestyle, and you danced so well.

2272
01:12:27,866 --> 01:12:29,334
She danced however she wanted.

2273
01:12:29,335 --> 01:12:30,964
Why aren't you dancing, In Ah?

2274
01:12:30,965 --> 01:12:33,231
I don't know anything about waacking.

2275
01:12:35,135 --> 01:12:38,092
(She doesn't seem confident.)

2276
01:12:38,976 --> 01:12:40,074
(What kind of dance will In Ah show?)

2277
01:12:40,075 --> 01:12:41,414
Let's go, In Ah.

2278
01:12:44,575 --> 01:12:48,048
(Her facial expression changes completely.)

2279
01:12:49,715 --> 01:12:51,315
She dances well.

2280
01:12:51,316 --> 01:12:52,521
(She moves exactly to the beat.)

2281
01:12:54,526 --> 01:12:57,132
(She does a cartwheel.)

2282
01:12:57,325 --> 01:13:01,725
(People get excited when they see an advanced move.)

2283
01:13:02,495 --> 01:13:03,695
(She deserves more than a whole boiled chicken.)

2284
01:13:03,696 --> 01:13:05,178
Look at her.

2285
01:13:06,165 --> 01:13:07,765
Show us breakdancing.

2286
01:13:07,766 --> 01:13:09,691
1, 2, 3, 4.

2287
01:13:12,976 --> 01:13:15,623
(It's a perfect finish.)

2288
01:13:16,516 --> 01:13:18,946
(Everyone gapes.)

2289
01:13:19,186 --> 01:13:21,044
(You deserve the whole boiled chicken, In Ah.)

2290
01:13:21,045 --> 01:13:22,185
She's a good dancer.

2291
01:13:22,186 --> 01:13:23,954
Hey, let's show them.

2292
01:13:23,955 --> 01:13:25,685
Show them what?

2293
01:13:25,686 --> 01:13:26,859
That was amazing.

2294
01:13:27,325 --> 01:13:29,294
- We'll use the same song. - You look like celebrities.

2295
01:13:29,295 --> 01:13:32,494
Seok Jin, go up and join them.

2296
01:13:32,495 --> 01:13:33,725
(Shall I warm up?)

2297
01:13:33,726 --> 01:13:36,565
- Should I dance too? - Seok Jin is "Train to Busan".

2298
01:13:36,566 --> 01:13:37,794
(Zombie dance on "Train to Busan")

2299
01:13:37,795 --> 01:13:39,935
We'll be serious. Take a look at us, Chungha.

2300
01:13:39,936 --> 01:13:41,034
Okay.

2301
01:13:41,035 --> 01:13:42,168
(What will they show me?)

2302
01:13:43,505 --> 01:13:45,275
(Excited)

2303
01:13:45,276 --> 01:13:46,996
(We'll show you properly.)

2304
01:13:47,346 --> 01:13:48,405
(He starts alone.)

2305
01:13:48,406 --> 01:13:49,785
That's not it.

2306
01:13:50,245 --> 01:13:51,924
(He makes a mistake from the start.)

2307
01:13:53,545 --> 01:13:56,543
(Their facial expressions are like dancers.)

2308
01:13:58,585 --> 01:14:02,541
(They dance together better than expected.)

2309
01:14:03,455 --> 01:14:04,866
(Their practice is paying off.)

2310
01:14:06,125 --> 01:14:07,774
(They dance well.)

2311
01:14:08,766 --> 01:14:09,930
How does it go?

2312
01:14:11,335 --> 01:14:13,605
(He starts to malfunction.)

2313
01:14:13,606 --> 01:14:14,834
There you go.

2314
01:14:14,835 --> 01:14:16,074
Good.

2315
01:14:16,075 --> 01:14:17,735
(It's a group dance, but they're out of sync.)

2316
01:14:17,736 --> 01:14:21,002
(Each person creates his own dance.)

2317
01:14:21,846 --> 01:14:24,493
(This is the original dance.)

2318
01:14:24,715 --> 01:14:26,284
- It's chaos. - I'm dizzy.

2319
01:14:26,285 --> 01:14:27,893
- It's chaos. - I'm dizzy.

2320
01:14:28,446 --> 01:14:30,685
What was that?

2321
01:14:30,686 --> 01:14:31,850
I can't remember at all.

2322
01:14:31,885 --> 01:14:33,584
I like the song.

2323
01:14:33,585 --> 01:14:35,234
Seok Jin, we practiced a lot.

2324
01:14:35,486 --> 01:14:37,754
- He can't remember. - I can't remember at all.

2325
01:14:37,755 --> 01:14:39,464
I couldn't help being nervous.

2326
01:14:39,465 --> 01:14:40,964
- I can't remember. - I'm nervous.

2327
01:14:40,965 --> 01:14:42,366
What do we do?

2328
01:14:43,096 --> 01:14:44,534
I can't remember at all.

2329
01:14:44,535 --> 01:14:46,049
We practiced for over 10 hours.

2330
01:14:46,866 --> 01:14:49,028
It's over.

2331
01:14:49,806 --> 01:14:51,174
- Everyone. - Yes?

2332
01:14:51,175 --> 01:14:52,174
(It's time to pay.)

2333
01:14:52,175 --> 01:14:53,605
I'll announce...

2334
01:14:53,606 --> 01:14:56,017
the amount you'll pay in this round.

2335
01:14:56,745 --> 01:14:58,084
- I think this will be expensive. - Will people pay?

2336
01:14:58,175 --> 01:15:00,445
The amount you will pay...

2337
01:15:00,446 --> 01:15:02,044
is 27 dollars.

2338
01:15:02,045 --> 01:15:04,754
(Boiled chicken with neungi mushrooms costs 27 dollars.)

2339
01:15:04,755 --> 01:15:05,924
It's expensive.

2340
01:15:05,925 --> 01:15:07,855
It's expensive. Is it the most expensive?

2341
01:15:07,856 --> 01:15:09,424
If we go for one chance...

2342
01:15:09,425 --> 01:15:10,695
(10 people should pay a total of 27 dollars.)

2343
01:15:10,696 --> 01:15:12,494
Right? That will be the last chance.

2344
01:15:12,495 --> 01:15:14,924
Go for one chance and take the rest.

2345
01:15:14,925 --> 01:15:15,935
(If they pay more, the one who pays the most wins the extra money.)

2346
01:15:15,936 --> 01:15:16,996
Let's start.

2347
01:15:17,866 --> 01:15:18,964
(Se Chan is the first to pay.)

2348
01:15:18,965 --> 01:15:21,747
How much will you pay?

2349
01:15:21,866 --> 01:15:23,204
Shall I take a risk?

2350
01:15:23,205 --> 01:15:25,234
(How much does Se Chan pay?)

2351
01:15:25,976 --> 01:15:27,345
Three dollars.

2352
01:15:27,346 --> 01:15:29,174
(3 dollars)

2353
01:15:29,175 --> 01:15:30,315
(If each person pays 3 dollars, they'll pay more than 27 dollars.)

2354
01:15:30,316 --> 01:15:31,845
Your payment was received.

2355
01:15:31,846 --> 01:15:33,414
(Se Chan makes a safe investment.)

2356
01:15:33,415 --> 01:15:34,992
This is difficult.

2357
01:15:35,715 --> 01:15:37,115
(How much will In Ah pay?)

2358
01:15:37,116 --> 01:15:38,414
I'll pay seven dollars.

2359
01:15:38,415 --> 01:15:40,324
(She pays 7 dollars.)

2360
01:15:40,325 --> 01:15:43,283
(As expected, In Ah pays a big amount.)

2361
01:15:44,325 --> 01:15:45,454
Kwang Soo.

2362
01:15:45,455 --> 01:15:47,924
(Next is Kwang Soo.)

2363
01:15:47,925 --> 01:15:50,542
Isn't it better to pay the most?

2364
01:15:50,866 --> 01:15:53,164
It's meaningless to be in the middle.

2365
01:15:53,165 --> 01:15:54,545
You either win or lose.

2366
01:15:55,266 --> 01:15:59,374
(He thinks hard because it's the last chance to pay.)

2367
01:15:59,375 --> 01:16:01,945
(During today's race)

2368
01:16:01,946 --> 01:16:05,815
(The one with the highest balance gets a penalty exemption ticket.)

2369
01:16:05,816 --> 01:16:09,084
(The one with the lowest balance is the loser.)

2370
01:16:09,085 --> 01:16:12,515
(The loser picks another member...)

2371
01:16:12,516 --> 01:16:15,155
(to get a water bomb together.)

2372
01:16:15,156 --> 01:16:18,494
(Except the winner, everyone else is at the risk of being penalized.)

2373
01:16:18,495 --> 01:16:21,895
(It's meaningless unless you win.)

2374
01:16:21,896 --> 01:16:23,164
I'll pay 21 dollars.

2375
01:16:23,165 --> 01:16:25,365
(21 dollars)

2376
01:16:25,366 --> 01:16:27,704
(What's the current total including Kwang Soo's payment?)

2377
01:16:27,705 --> 01:16:29,674
(3 dollars)

2378
01:16:29,675 --> 01:16:31,334
(3 dollars plus 7 dollars)

2379
01:16:31,335 --> 01:16:34,174
(3 plus 7 plus 21 dollars are 31 dollars.)

2380
01:16:34,175 --> 01:16:35,504
(The total is 27 dollars.)

2381
01:16:35,505 --> 01:16:37,505
(They've paid 4 dollars more than what they need to pay.)

2382
01:16:38,316 --> 01:16:41,945
(If 21 dollars is the highest, Kwang Soo gets the rest.)

2383
01:16:41,946 --> 01:16:46,210
(Will Kwang Soo be able to succeed?)

2384
01:16:47,186 --> 01:16:49,215
If I had a lot of money,

2385
01:16:49,755 --> 01:16:51,655
I would use everything. Then it's over.

2386
01:16:51,656 --> 01:16:53,595
(Someone will definitely put all his money in.)

2387
01:16:53,596 --> 01:16:55,625
(Someone will definitely put all his money in.)

2388
01:16:55,995 --> 01:16:59,055
(That's me, Jae Seok.)

2389
01:16:59,936 --> 01:17:03,273
(People are more careful since it's the last time.)

2390
01:17:03,535 --> 01:17:07,976
(Payment has been made.)

2391
01:17:08,545 --> 01:17:12,515
The amount that you should have paid...

2392
01:17:12,516 --> 01:17:14,544
- is 27 dollars. - Right.

2393
01:17:14,545 --> 01:17:16,751
- I bet it exceeded. - Definitely.

2394
01:17:16,885 --> 01:17:19,855
The total amount that you paid was...

2395
01:17:19,856 --> 01:17:21,725
It'll be shocking if it's 40 to 50 dollars.

2396
01:17:21,726 --> 01:17:23,755
- I think it'll be that much. - If it's 40 to 50 dollars...

2397
01:17:23,795 --> 01:17:25,895
It'll be creepy if it's over 50 dollars.

2398
01:17:25,896 --> 01:17:27,494
The total amount that you paid was...

2399
01:17:27,495 --> 01:17:29,124
(What's the total amount that they paid?)

2400
01:17:29,125 --> 01:17:30,395
It's 60 dollars.

2401
01:17:30,396 --> 01:17:33,435
(60 dollars)

2402
01:17:33,436 --> 01:17:35,052
How many are we?

2403
01:17:35,306 --> 01:17:38,572
(That's amazing.)

2404
01:17:39,306 --> 01:17:40,405
Everyone put everything in.

2405
01:17:40,406 --> 01:17:42,074
The winner will take it all.

2406
01:17:42,075 --> 01:17:43,244
It'll be the winner.

2407
01:17:43,245 --> 01:17:45,574
- It's someone who put everything. - It'll be one of them.

2408
01:17:45,575 --> 01:17:47,986
Who put everything in? I didn't have enough money.

2409
01:17:47,986 --> 01:17:52,214
One of you will the additional 33 dollars.

2410
01:17:52,215 --> 01:17:53,324
That's right.

2411
01:17:53,325 --> 01:17:56,034
The winner paid over 20 dollars.

2412
01:17:57,495 --> 01:17:59,349
- It must be you. - It's him.

2413
01:17:59,396 --> 01:18:01,324
- It's Chungha. - No.

2414
01:18:01,325 --> 01:18:02,424
- It's Chungha. - It's not me.

2415
01:18:02,425 --> 01:18:04,095
- Waacking... - It's not me.

2416
01:18:04,096 --> 01:18:05,294
It's Kwang Soo.

2417
01:18:05,295 --> 01:18:07,191
- How many did you pay, Kwang Soo? - That startled me.

2418
01:18:08,236 --> 01:18:09,409
Is it you?

2419
01:18:09,575 --> 01:18:10,805
Should I say it?

2420
01:18:10,806 --> 01:18:12,381
I have one last announcement to make.

2421
01:18:12,875 --> 01:18:13,945
I paid...

2422
01:18:13,946 --> 01:18:15,445
over 20 dollars.

2423
01:18:15,446 --> 01:18:16,574
(I paid over 20 dollars.)

2424
01:18:16,575 --> 01:18:19,015
Congratulations, the one who paid the most...

2425
01:18:19,016 --> 01:18:21,315
(Congratulations, the one who paid the most is...)

2426
01:18:21,316 --> 01:18:22,714
is Jae Seok, and he will get the extra money.

2427
01:18:22,715 --> 01:18:24,685
(Jae Seok will get the extra money.)

2428
01:18:24,686 --> 01:18:25,855
(Jae Seok is the final winner.)

2429
01:18:25,856 --> 01:18:27,954
He knew about it.

2430
01:18:27,955 --> 01:18:29,494
- He knew. - Jae Seok.

2431
01:18:29,495 --> 01:18:31,254
Did you have that much money?

2432
01:18:31,255 --> 01:18:32,794
I had 22 dollars.

2433
01:18:32,795 --> 01:18:34,624
- 22 dollars? - That's all?

2434
01:18:34,625 --> 01:18:36,235
I paid 21 dollars.

2435
01:18:36,236 --> 01:18:38,365
(He's about to lose it.)

2436
01:18:38,366 --> 01:18:42,487
(Jae Seok wins by just one dollar.)

2437
01:18:44,306 --> 01:18:45,675
I'll put everything in.

2438
01:18:46,705 --> 01:18:47,905
I'll take a risk.

2439
01:18:47,906 --> 01:18:49,204
(Jae Seok puts everything in like Kwang Soo.)

2440
01:18:49,205 --> 01:18:50,514
Here we go.

2441
01:18:52,075 --> 01:18:56,650
(He pays 22 dollars.)

2442
01:18:57,285 --> 01:19:00,964
(Jae Seok wins the race by just one dollar.)

2443
01:19:01,486 --> 01:19:02,924
Both of you paid most of it.

2444
01:19:02,925 --> 01:19:05,058
If Se Chan hadn't eaten and paid me a dollar,

2445
01:19:05,156 --> 01:19:06,265
I would have had 21 dollars.

2446
01:19:06,266 --> 01:19:08,265
- Because of the money from me? - Yes.

2447
01:19:08,266 --> 01:19:09,501
(Jae Seok would've had 21 dollars.)

2448
01:19:10,495 --> 01:19:12,164
As a result,

2449
01:19:12,165 --> 01:19:14,329
Jae Seok wins 33 dollars. He's the winner.

2450
01:19:15,035 --> 01:19:17,105
Kwang Soo has 0 dollars.

2451
01:19:17,106 --> 01:19:18,651
Oh, no.

2452
01:19:19,236 --> 01:19:21,100
Kwang Soo is in trouble.

2453
01:19:21,346 --> 01:19:22,674
In Ah, don't be so excited.

2454
01:19:22,675 --> 01:19:24,244
Excluding Kwang Soo,

2455
01:19:24,245 --> 01:19:26,414
you've placed last. You'll be penalized.

2456
01:19:26,415 --> 01:19:27,485
Pardon?

2457
01:19:27,486 --> 01:19:29,062
- In Ah. - Why is he excluded?

2458
01:19:29,346 --> 01:19:31,214
He went bankrupt, so he's excluded.

2459
01:19:31,215 --> 01:19:32,884
- I went bankrupt. - In Ah has placed last.

2460
01:19:32,885 --> 01:19:36,994
The one that In Ah picks will get a water bomb with her.

2461
01:19:36,995 --> 01:19:38,355
Jae Seok is exempt from the penalty.

2462
01:19:38,356 --> 01:19:39,664
(Jae Seok is exempt from the penalty.)

2463
01:19:39,665 --> 01:19:40,902
I got lucky today.

2464
01:19:41,165 --> 01:19:42,917
I was surprised in the end.

2465
01:19:43,335 --> 01:19:45,189
People who have gone bankrupt are exempt.

2466
01:19:45,535 --> 01:19:47,565
- So Min wanted to get a water bomb. - Right.

2467
01:19:47,566 --> 01:19:49,462
(Seok Jin tells on her.)

2468
01:19:49,776 --> 01:19:51,834
- Didn't So Min say... - No.

2469
01:19:51,835 --> 01:19:53,453
that she's hot?

2470
01:19:53,646 --> 01:19:55,356
She wanted to play in water.

2471
01:19:55,575 --> 01:19:57,145
- Who? - So Min.

2472
01:19:57,146 --> 01:19:59,044
(Avoiding eye contact)

2473
01:19:59,045 --> 01:20:00,148
And...

2474
01:20:00,715 --> 01:20:02,951
someone stole my fishcake.

2475
01:20:03,455 --> 01:20:04,959
(Feeling guilty)

2476
01:20:05,486 --> 01:20:07,855
(Why did you steal In Ah's fishcake earlier?)

2477
01:20:07,856 --> 01:20:08,954
The fishcake.

2478
01:20:08,955 --> 01:20:10,155
How dare you steal her fishcake?

2479
01:20:10,156 --> 01:20:11,655
Wait, I just changed my mind.

2480
01:20:11,656 --> 01:20:13,265
(Wait, I just changed my mind.)

2481
01:20:13,266 --> 01:20:14,501
I'll choose Kwang Soo.

2482
01:20:14,566 --> 01:20:16,760
- Kwang Soo has to get it anyway. - I have to get it anyway.

2483
01:20:17,366 --> 01:20:19,805
(He's set to face the penalty. Having no money is sad enough.)

2484
01:20:19,806 --> 01:20:21,515
(How could you choose me?)

2485
01:20:21,806 --> 01:20:23,731
I'll be facing the penalty with you anyway.

2486
01:20:24,306 --> 01:20:25,572
I don't have any money left.

2487
01:20:26,035 --> 01:20:27,044
(Are you making fun of me?)

2488
01:20:27,045 --> 01:20:28,415
(He's very sensitive.)

2489
01:20:28,505 --> 01:20:29,674
- Who will it be? - Have you decided?

2490
01:20:29,675 --> 01:20:31,544
- Yes. - 1, 2, 3.

2491
01:20:31,545 --> 01:20:34,784
Why are you doing this to me? Why?

2492
01:20:34,785 --> 01:20:36,454
(The penalty partner In Ah chooses is...)

2493
01:20:36,455 --> 01:20:38,055
(Seok Jin, the fishcake thief.)

2494
01:20:38,056 --> 01:20:40,884
- Why are you doing this to me? - This is neat.

2495
01:20:40,885 --> 01:20:42,555
Good job, today.

2496
01:20:42,556 --> 01:20:45,543
(Seok Jin, In Ah, and Kwang Soo will face the penalty.)

2497
01:20:47,066 --> 01:20:49,964
All right. The two of you dyed your hair nicely today.

2498
01:20:49,965 --> 01:20:52,565
- Yes. Both of them dyed their hair. - That's right.

2499
01:20:52,566 --> 01:20:54,153
Jae Seok is really annoying today.

2500
01:20:54,205 --> 01:20:55,765
Hey, you're next.

2501
01:20:55,766 --> 01:20:58,504
You guys look like a newer version of KOYOTE.

2502
01:20:58,505 --> 01:21:00,445
(It's 2019 version of KOYOTE.)

2503
01:21:00,446 --> 01:21:01,445
- Please. - Bbaekga.

2504
01:21:01,446 --> 01:21:02,445
No.

2505
01:21:02,446 --> 01:21:04,174
Seok Jin looks like Jong Min.

2506
01:21:04,175 --> 01:21:06,445
- He's Jong Min. - He resembles Jong Min.

2507
01:21:06,446 --> 01:21:08,945
- 1, 2, 3. - 2, 3.

2508
01:21:08,946 --> 01:21:09,954
(The water bomb is launched to get rid of the heat wave.)

2509
01:21:09,955 --> 01:21:11,604
(Splashing)

2510
01:21:12,356 --> 01:21:14,312
(Totally soaked)

2511
01:21:14,885 --> 01:21:16,091
Yellow water is dripping.

2512
01:21:17,156 --> 01:21:19,424
(Thank you for joining us for the break week.)

2513
01:21:19,425 --> 01:21:20,725
Good job today.

2514
01:21:20,726 --> 01:21:22,324
- Good job. - Good work.

2515
01:21:22,325 --> 01:21:24,602
(Thank you for joining us for the break week.)

2516
01:21:24,896 --> 01:21:27,894
(Unidentified people are singing trot songs behind the doors?)

2517
01:21:28,465 --> 01:21:29,534
(Singer)

2518
01:21:29,535 --> 01:21:30,634
(Keyboard)

2519
01:21:30,635 --> 01:21:31,665
(Lawn... Could it be...?)

2520
01:21:31,875 --> 01:21:35,039
(It's time to meet the artists for their joint performances.)

2521
01:21:35,776 --> 01:21:37,315
(They start preparing for the joint performances with other artists.)

2522
01:21:37,316 --> 01:21:38,346
(Finally!)

2523
01:21:38,675 --> 01:21:40,845
(If you're a group, how many of you are single?)

2524
01:21:40,846 --> 01:21:41,845
(They may be distracted.)

2525
01:21:41,846 --> 01:21:43,515
(What do you think about Kwang Soo?)

2526
01:21:43,516 --> 01:21:44,515
Hold on.

2527
01:21:44,516 --> 01:21:45,515
(They may be rejected.)

2528
01:21:45,516 --> 01:21:48,055
(However, they don't want to lose these artists.)

2529
01:21:48,056 --> 01:21:49,055
(The best lineup you can't give up on)

2530
01:21:49,056 --> 01:21:51,807
(The legion of the artists will be revealed soon.)

2531
01:21:52,026 --> 01:21:53,624
(5th Episode of 9 Years of Running Man)

2532
