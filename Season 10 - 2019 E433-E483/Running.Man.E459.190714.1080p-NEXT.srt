1
00:00:05,330 --> 00:00:07,094
(Last week)

2
00:00:08,260 --> 00:00:11,768
(The Teamwork Race will determine the partners of the members.)

3
00:00:11,769 --> 00:00:14,938
(The members were overly motivated before revealing the identities.)

4
00:00:14,939 --> 00:00:17,109
(At last, the artists for the joint performances were revealed.)

5
00:00:17,110 --> 00:00:18,838
(Gummy)

6
00:00:18,839 --> 00:00:20,778
(Code Kunst and Nucksal)

7
00:00:20,779 --> 00:00:23,055
(SORAN and Apink)

8
00:00:23,950 --> 00:00:27,346
(This awesome lineup reminds them of a festival.)

9
00:00:28,279 --> 00:00:30,431
(Current Partners)

10
00:00:31,189 --> 00:00:36,318
(They must win missions to team up with the artist of their choice.)

11
00:00:36,319 --> 00:00:40,129
(Teams in 1st and 2nd places will get cards to switch partners.)

12
00:00:40,130 --> 00:00:43,928
(If all 3 members pick the same card, the team will stay as it is.)

13
00:00:43,929 --> 00:00:49,448
(If one of them picks a different card, they'll switch partners.)

14
00:00:50,370 --> 00:00:51,431
What is this?

15
00:00:52,109 --> 00:00:53,263
I see water.

16
00:00:54,039 --> 00:00:55,232
What is this?

17
00:00:56,410 --> 00:00:57,430
What is this?

18
00:00:57,509 --> 00:00:58,804
Goodness, what is this?

19
00:00:59,480 --> 00:01:00,849
(Whipped cream, acupressure mats, a pool, and a karaoke machine)

20
00:01:00,850 --> 00:01:02,019
What's this?

21
00:01:02,020 --> 00:01:03,652
(What is the mission?)

22
00:01:04,319 --> 00:01:07,689
(Before the mission, everyone stands up with their teams.)

23
00:01:07,690 --> 00:01:09,618
(What?)

24
00:01:09,619 --> 00:01:11,529
- This isn't my team. - Over there.

25
00:01:11,530 --> 00:01:13,029
(Why did she suddenly stand next to Se Chan?)

26
00:01:13,030 --> 00:01:15,682
That was so natural. Why did you stand here?

27
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:17,529
- Right. - She stood right next to me.

28
00:01:17,530 --> 00:01:19,329
- You two had a thing... - But her team is over there.

29
00:01:19,330 --> 00:01:21,003
- a long time ago, right? - Yes.

30
00:01:22,270 --> 00:01:24,909
(Jae Seok said Na Eun belonged the mountain animal family.)

31
00:01:24,910 --> 00:01:26,208
(How could you say that?)

32
00:01:26,209 --> 00:01:28,861
(Na Eun is like Formosan sika deer.)

33
00:01:29,780 --> 00:01:34,105
(He confessed his feelings to her who resembled the beautiful deer.)

34
00:01:34,649 --> 00:01:35,948
She was my lady. Lady Na Eun.

35
00:01:35,949 --> 00:01:37,549
- I stood next to him. - What?

36
00:01:37,550 --> 00:01:39,219
- Lady Na Eun. - But Na Eun lets him believe...

37
00:01:39,220 --> 00:01:41,219
- there's a chance. - Exactly.

38
00:01:41,220 --> 00:01:42,618
(I do?)

39
00:01:42,619 --> 00:01:44,659
When she stood next to me, I almost rekindled our fling.

40
00:01:44,660 --> 00:01:46,728
- You never know. - I thought about it.

41
00:01:46,729 --> 00:01:48,599
- She makes him think he has a shot. - But I thought that wasn't right.

42
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:49,599
I almost went for it,

43
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:50,799
- but I'm going to get a grip. - Good job.

44
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:52,198
- After you thought about it? - Don't toy with him.

45
00:01:52,199 --> 00:01:54,076
Make it clear to him if you don't want him.

46
00:01:54,140 --> 00:01:57,838
By the way, is it a done deal that Kwang Soo will stay there?

47
00:01:57,839 --> 00:01:59,109
Of course.

48
00:01:59,110 --> 00:02:00,308
- Really? - We've gotten close now.

49
00:02:00,309 --> 00:02:01,870
Why aren't you answering?

50
00:02:02,380 --> 00:02:04,109
First of all, we've gotten close.

51
00:02:04,110 --> 00:02:06,379
- But... - What?

52
00:02:06,380 --> 00:02:07,818
- Of course, we got close. - I kept...

53
00:02:07,819 --> 00:02:09,578
- observing each team. - Okay.

54
00:02:09,579 --> 00:02:12,589
Kwang Soo kept hovering around Ji Yeon.

55
00:02:12,590 --> 00:02:14,318
- I'm her shadow. - Really?

56
00:02:14,319 --> 00:02:15,388
- He takes good care of me. - Right.

57
00:02:15,389 --> 00:02:17,758
Is that so? Code Kunst and Nucksal,

58
00:02:17,759 --> 00:02:20,034
it looked like you don't care about Seok Jin at all.

59
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:21,728
I don't care about them either.

60
00:02:21,729 --> 00:02:24,116
(Acting strong)

61
00:02:25,069 --> 00:02:27,339
No, no. No, no.

62
00:02:27,340 --> 00:02:29,899
- We talked after our meal. - What did you talk about?

63
00:02:29,900 --> 00:02:33,738
I asked him about our team. And he said not to even bring it up.

64
00:02:33,739 --> 00:02:35,341
(Don't even bring it up.)

65
00:02:36,109 --> 00:02:38,118
- He said not to bring it up. - "Don't even bring it up."

66
00:02:38,750 --> 00:02:41,119
Hey, there's always a challenge.

67
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:43,388
- How could you say that? - After observing him,

68
00:02:43,389 --> 00:02:45,736
he reminds me of a fairy who lives in a closet.

69
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:48,318
- You mean Dobby? - Right. He resembles Dobby.

70
00:02:48,319 --> 00:02:50,267
- He looks like Dobby. - Dobby...

71
00:02:50,389 --> 00:02:51,459
I resemble Dobby...

72
00:02:51,460 --> 00:02:53,469
- and the groom in "Corpse Bride". - Right.

73
00:02:54,329 --> 00:02:56,559
- He looks just like Dobby. - Dobby.

74
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:58,129
He looks like a character in horror movies.

75
00:02:58,130 --> 00:02:59,668
He didn't say that?

76
00:02:59,669 --> 00:03:01,439
- You resemble him too. - Who?

77
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:03,031
(Looking around)

78
00:03:03,069 --> 00:03:04,396
(Me?)

79
00:03:04,470 --> 00:03:06,008
- He resembles Dobby too. - How could you...

80
00:03:06,009 --> 00:03:09,309
You two belong to the same family. You're right. You resemble him.

81
00:03:09,310 --> 00:03:12,379
You will earn a chance to switch the partners with this mission.

82
00:03:12,380 --> 00:03:14,592
This mission will require your teamwork and singing skills.

83
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:16,312
It's called Athletic Singing Contest.

84
00:03:16,819 --> 00:03:18,219
- Great. - Three people...

85
00:03:18,220 --> 00:03:20,189
from each team will try out the mission.

86
00:03:20,190 --> 00:03:22,219
Each team will pick a song you're confident to sing...

87
00:03:22,220 --> 00:03:25,129
and connect each other's bodies while the song is playing.

88
00:03:25,130 --> 00:03:28,129
And the team with the highest score will win the mission.

89
00:03:28,130 --> 00:03:29,529
We have to connect our bodies.

90
00:03:29,530 --> 00:03:31,509
However, there's a rule you must follow to connect the bodies.

91
00:03:31,530 --> 00:03:34,732
Each person will roll the dice with six body parts written, twice.

92
00:03:34,799 --> 00:03:36,668
Only the selected body parts can touch the floor...

93
00:03:36,669 --> 00:03:37,996
when you connect the bodies.

94
00:03:38,009 --> 00:03:39,409
- What? - What if we get the face?

95
00:03:39,410 --> 00:03:40,608
What about the head?

96
00:03:40,609 --> 00:03:42,209
If a different part of the body touches the floor,

97
00:03:42,210 --> 00:03:44,179
a point will be deducted for every second.

98
00:03:44,180 --> 00:03:47,578
All right. Code Kunst and Nucksal, you can go first.

99
00:03:47,579 --> 00:03:48,578
All right.

100
00:03:48,579 --> 00:03:50,589
(They throw the dice to select body parts that can touch the floor.)

101
00:03:50,590 --> 00:03:51,589
- Head. - Head.

102
00:03:51,590 --> 00:03:53,818
Head. You can roll it one more time.

103
00:03:53,819 --> 00:03:55,146
(It would be easy if we get the back.)

104
00:03:56,220 --> 00:03:58,488
(What is Seok Jin's second body part?)

105
00:03:58,489 --> 00:03:59,683
- Bottom. - Bottom.

106
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:02,163
How can only his head and bottom touch the floor?

107
00:04:02,630 --> 00:04:05,298
- How is that even possible? - Only my head and bottom can touch?

108
00:04:05,299 --> 00:04:06,969
Isn't that the worst combination?

109
00:04:06,970 --> 00:04:08,601
Only my head and bottom can touch the floor?

110
00:04:08,940 --> 00:04:10,469
- That's really hard. - Ji Hyo.

111
00:04:10,470 --> 00:04:11,490
(They must keep their position during the 1st verse.)

112
00:04:11,769 --> 00:04:13,443
- She got the back. - Back.

113
00:04:13,780 --> 00:04:16,023
- She got a nice one. - That's the best one.

114
00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:18,808
- Back and bottom. Back and head. - That's good.

115
00:04:18,809 --> 00:04:20,758
- You can just lie down. - Go ahead.

116
00:04:22,479 --> 00:04:24,118
- Back. - I'm the only one with bad parts.

117
00:04:24,119 --> 00:04:25,418
Back and feet. Okay.

118
00:04:25,419 --> 00:04:27,819
- That's the best combination. - Back and feet.

119
00:04:27,820 --> 00:04:28,840
(Back and feet, back and head, and head and bottom)

120
00:04:29,220 --> 00:04:31,529
- Start when the song plays. - Okay.

121
00:04:31,530 --> 00:04:32,529
(Staying close to the microphone is advantageous.)

122
00:04:32,530 --> 00:04:34,428
- Let's go. - Let's go.

123
00:04:34,429 --> 00:04:35,829
Ji Hyo, follow the rules.

124
00:04:35,830 --> 00:04:37,095
I'm following the rules.

125
00:04:37,830 --> 00:04:39,668
- Your feet aren't touching. - They aren't touching.

126
00:04:39,669 --> 00:04:40,925
They aren't touching.

127
00:04:41,039 --> 00:04:43,416
- Feet. - Seok Jin, I can't reach.

128
00:04:43,910 --> 00:04:47,108
Seok Jin, you have to go into the water. You have no choice.

129
00:04:47,109 --> 00:04:49,038
(You have to do that to make your bodies touch.)

130
00:04:49,039 --> 00:04:51,209
- Right. Your bodies must touch. - Let's do it again.

131
00:04:51,210 --> 00:04:54,719
You should take turns since it's hard to connect all at once.

132
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:57,819
- My back has to be in the water. - Right. Just do it.

133
00:04:57,820 --> 00:04:59,687
You have to go into the water.

134
00:05:00,189 --> 00:05:02,261
I have to go into the water no matter what.

135
00:05:02,660 --> 00:05:05,688
How many times did say you have to go into the water?

136
00:05:05,689 --> 00:05:08,399
How many times did you tell me? Did you tell me dozens of times?

137
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:10,529
Hey, I thought they were having lovers' quarrel.

138
00:05:10,530 --> 00:05:11,798
Hey.

139
00:05:11,799 --> 00:05:14,399
- My gosh. Unbelievable. - You take my spot then.

140
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:16,538
You want to switch because you don't want your back to get wet.

141
00:05:16,539 --> 00:05:18,709
- That's right. I don't want that. - Ji Hyo sounds really angry.

142
00:05:18,710 --> 00:05:21,509
No, I don't want to. You go in. You picked back and head.

143
00:05:21,510 --> 00:05:23,855
- You're unbelievable. You... - No, I don't want to.

144
00:05:23,910 --> 00:05:24,949
Darn you.

145
00:05:24,950 --> 00:05:26,817
(He acts out since he can't win the argument.)

146
00:05:27,119 --> 00:05:28,279
- I can't. - Did you throw that?

147
00:05:28,280 --> 00:05:29,719
I can't sing the song.

148
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:30,949
Take care of Nucksal.

149
00:05:30,950 --> 00:05:33,019
- Hey. - Take care of Nucksal.

150
00:05:33,020 --> 00:05:34,389
- Take care of him. - Please take care of me.

151
00:05:34,390 --> 00:05:36,735
And he said that he's known for his considerate behaviors.

152
00:05:37,530 --> 00:05:39,876
- He said he's an English gentleman. - English gentleman.

153
00:05:39,929 --> 00:05:41,255
He said he's an English gentleman.

154
00:05:41,929 --> 00:05:43,123
We'll start now.

155
00:05:43,129 --> 00:05:44,149
Start.

156
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:45,599
Connect your bodies first.

157
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:47,436
(Go away. This is my spot.)

158
00:05:48,799 --> 00:05:50,126
She's set. You're next.

159
00:05:51,609 --> 00:05:53,375
(The song has already started. Only Ji Hyo is in position.)

160
00:05:54,410 --> 00:05:56,678
(Only his bottom and head can touch the floor.)

161
00:05:56,679 --> 00:05:58,449
- There you go. Yes. - They must touch his head. Good.

162
00:05:58,450 --> 00:05:59,808
(He gently lies down as he doesn't want to get wet.)

163
00:05:59,809 --> 00:06:01,687
(I will help you not to fall into the water.)

164
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:04,155
(Success! All three of their bodies are touching.)

165
00:06:04,989 --> 00:06:06,999
(He starts rapping now.)

166
00:06:07,590 --> 00:06:09,659
(Back and feet, head and bottom, and head and back)

167
00:06:09,660 --> 00:06:10,680
It's cold.

168
00:06:11,460 --> 00:06:13,468
(His diction is excellent.)

169
00:06:13,700 --> 00:06:15,434
(Screaming)

170
00:06:15,900 --> 00:06:17,099
His head is touching.

171
00:06:17,100 --> 00:06:18,497
(He tries his best not to get his hair wet.)

172
00:06:19,570 --> 00:06:20,569
Seok Jin.

173
00:06:20,570 --> 00:06:21,661
(He's trying so hard not to wet his hair.)

174
00:06:23,340 --> 00:06:24,666
Hey, don't pinch my scalp.

175
00:06:26,010 --> 00:06:27,234
Lift your head!

176
00:06:29,239 --> 00:06:30,607
He's struggling.

177
00:06:30,650 --> 00:06:32,006
He doesn't want to get wet.

178
00:06:34,020 --> 00:06:35,683
(Lifting up)

179
00:06:36,950 --> 00:06:39,367
(Ji Hyo kindly lifts up his head to save it from getting wet.)

180
00:06:39,989 --> 00:06:41,551
(Ji Hyo's feet have the strongest hold!)

181
00:06:41,919 --> 00:06:43,348
Hey, don't pinch!

182
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:46,474
- I'm holding you up. - Why are you doing that?

183
00:06:46,489 --> 00:06:48,061
I'm holding you up.

184
00:06:48,660 --> 00:06:49,858
- Your feet... - Seriously.

185
00:06:49,859 --> 00:06:51,227
(The 1st verse ends in the middle of their argument.)

186
00:06:51,570 --> 00:06:52,752
- Seriously. - Hey.

187
00:06:53,900 --> 00:06:56,623
That was more than the first verse. You kept playing until the bridge.

188
00:06:57,369 --> 00:06:58,608
What's the score?

189
00:06:58,609 --> 00:07:01,496
(His rapping was excellent. What's the score from the machine?)

190
00:07:02,109 --> 00:07:04,308
(The score for Team Nucksal and Code Kunst...)

191
00:07:04,309 --> 00:07:05,579
- My gosh. - 28 points.

192
00:07:05,580 --> 00:07:07,519
We can beat this. We have a shot!

193
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:08,877
(He was great, but the score was unexpectedly low.)

194
00:07:09,379 --> 00:07:11,634
(He's suddenly feeling confident.)

195
00:07:12,220 --> 00:07:14,127
- We can beat this. Are you ready? - Okay.

196
00:07:14,189 --> 00:07:16,118
- Gosh, 28 points? We can beat it. - What happened?

197
00:07:16,119 --> 00:07:18,829
All right. The score was 28 points.

198
00:07:18,830 --> 00:07:21,584
Nucksal's head touched the floor for 13 seconds. We deduced 13.

199
00:07:22,330 --> 00:07:24,981
And Ji Hyo's bottom touched, so we deducted 10 points.

200
00:07:25,030 --> 00:07:27,621
- The final score is five points. - I...

201
00:07:27,700 --> 00:07:29,740
Five points? That's the worst.

202
00:07:29,770 --> 00:07:32,339
We can win points as long as we keep our postures.

203
00:07:32,340 --> 00:07:33,639
Next up is...

204
00:07:33,640 --> 00:07:35,445
- SORAN, right? - Yes, we'll go next.

205
00:07:35,780 --> 00:07:37,207
- You can do this. - Let's do this.

206
00:07:38,150 --> 00:07:40,190
- Okay. - Tall guys, do the mission.

207
00:07:40,919 --> 00:07:42,276
They are the tallest in our team.

208
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:43,983
- They are the tallest guys. - They are the tallest.

209
00:07:44,549 --> 00:07:46,018
They aren't funny, but...

210
00:07:46,049 --> 00:07:48,263
- We'll win. We will. - They're not funny, but we'll win.

211
00:07:48,559 --> 00:07:49,558
Let's do this!

212
00:07:49,559 --> 00:07:50,682
(He's feeling enthusiastic too.)

213
00:07:51,460 --> 00:07:52,688
(He's feeling overly enthusiastic than usual.)

214
00:07:52,689 --> 00:07:54,128
What do you think about enthusiastic guys?

215
00:07:54,900 --> 00:07:56,699
He's every girl's ideal type.

216
00:07:56,700 --> 00:07:59,399
(He's every girl's ideal type.)

217
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:01,786
(The exemplary man of their ideal type)

218
00:08:02,470 --> 00:08:03,738
Great, great!

219
00:08:03,739 --> 00:08:05,749
(His enthusiasm explodes.)

220
00:08:05,869 --> 00:08:07,441
- Do well. - Nice!

221
00:08:08,039 --> 00:08:09,263
We're off to a great start.

222
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:11,079
We're off to a great start.

223
00:08:11,080 --> 00:08:12,178
(He doesn't stop cheering them on.)

224
00:08:12,179 --> 00:08:13,373
(Glancing)

225
00:08:14,150 --> 00:08:18,026
I just spotted this. Na Eun keeps glancing at you.

226
00:08:18,590 --> 00:08:19,688
Really?

227
00:08:19,689 --> 00:08:20,882
Just now, I asked...

228
00:08:21,119 --> 00:08:23,558
about enthusiastic guys, and she said they are her ideal types.

229
00:08:23,559 --> 00:08:26,889
You are our ideal type.

230
00:08:26,890 --> 00:08:30,358
All right. We're ready. Okay, go, go, go!

231
00:08:30,359 --> 00:08:31,829
(He stays enthusiastic for the beautiful deer.)

232
00:08:31,830 --> 00:08:34,797
Let's go!

233
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:37,250
(Her heart pounds.)

234
00:08:37,940 --> 00:08:40,309
(I will stay enthusiastic until my body breaks down,)

235
00:08:40,310 --> 00:08:42,930
(my dear lady.)

236
00:08:43,409 --> 00:08:44,573
Gosh, he's so theatrical.

237
00:08:46,149 --> 00:08:48,679
(He throws the dice in the midst of Se Chan's cheer.)

238
00:08:48,680 --> 00:08:49,778
Bottom.

239
00:08:49,779 --> 00:08:51,919
(Feet, bottom, head)

240
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:54,878
(Back and feet, head and bottom, and stomach and feet)

241
00:08:55,489 --> 00:08:57,469
My gosh, he's amazing.

242
00:08:58,029 --> 00:08:59,559
Se Chan looks like a coach.

243
00:08:59,560 --> 00:09:00,699
You can sit down.

244
00:09:00,700 --> 00:09:01,929
(His passion exudes even from his back.)

245
00:09:01,930 --> 00:09:03,599
- Do you have head and bottom? - Head and bottom.

246
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:05,128
- He's not talking. - He's not talking.

247
00:09:05,129 --> 00:09:07,067
- He's only mouthing it. - He has no idea what he's doing.

248
00:09:08,340 --> 00:09:10,308
(Mouthing)

249
00:09:11,009 --> 00:09:12,669
Wait, you're not saying anything.

250
00:09:12,670 --> 00:09:14,079
Can you lie down on your side with your head and bottom?

251
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:15,138
He has leadership skills.

252
00:09:15,139 --> 00:09:16,278
- That's right. - On your side.

253
00:09:16,279 --> 00:09:17,878
- You can do this, right? - Yes!

254
00:09:17,879 --> 00:09:19,008
Let's go!

255
00:09:19,009 --> 00:09:20,549
(His leadership skills explode.)

256
00:09:21,379 --> 00:09:22,807
We can do this!

257
00:09:23,180 --> 00:09:25,349
(Se Chan opened up a new horizon for ideal types.)

258
00:09:25,350 --> 00:09:26,951
- SORAN. - Okay.

259
00:09:27,290 --> 00:09:29,871
That really looked like a team-building trip from a company.

260
00:09:30,190 --> 00:09:31,312
- You can do this! - Where should I go?

261
00:09:32,290 --> 00:09:34,441
- "Love Is". Turbo's song. - "Love Is"?

262
00:09:35,029 --> 00:09:36,631
- Go! Start. - You can do this.

263
00:09:37,529 --> 00:09:39,161
- There you go. - You're doing great.

264
00:09:39,369 --> 00:09:40,939
- Go inside. - Nice!

265
00:09:40,940 --> 00:09:42,878
- There you go! - Head and bottom.

266
00:09:42,940 --> 00:09:44,132
Head... There you go.

267
00:09:44,170 --> 00:09:45,268
Great, great.

268
00:09:45,269 --> 00:09:46,841
- Great. - Great. Sing it!

269
00:09:46,940 --> 00:09:48,062
Your feet have to touch.

270
00:09:48,310 --> 00:09:49,439
(He has to sing now.)

271
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:51,347
- Not yet. - Not yet.

272
00:09:51,509 --> 00:09:53,408
- It's still the interlude. - The verse still hasn't started.

273
00:09:53,409 --> 00:09:55,184
- They picked a long one. - It's so long.

274
00:09:55,249 --> 00:09:57,596
- Was the interlude this long? - Why did you pick a long one?

275
00:09:57,649 --> 00:09:58,819
- Jump the interlude. - Hey.

276
00:09:58,820 --> 00:10:00,012
Why is the interlude so long?

277
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:02,113
When will it start?

278
00:10:02,220 --> 00:10:03,719
Why is the interlude so long?

279
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:04,829
- Hey. - It's too long.

280
00:10:04,830 --> 00:10:06,767
- Jung Nam didn't sing the song. - Here it goes.

281
00:10:06,889 --> 00:10:08,059
It's starting now.

282
00:10:08,060 --> 00:10:11,742
(The song starts at last.)

283
00:10:12,330 --> 00:10:14,169
(He sings in a stable manner with only his stomach touching.)

284
00:10:14,170 --> 00:10:15,393
He's singing now.

285
00:10:15,470 --> 00:10:16,569
The microphone is picking up his voice.

286
00:10:16,570 --> 00:10:17,895
(The posture is good and so is his voice.)

287
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:21,508
There you go!

288
00:10:21,509 --> 00:10:23,209
(They are holding perfect postures...)

289
00:10:23,210 --> 00:10:24,842
(while touching only the selected body parts.)

290
00:10:25,649 --> 00:10:27,549
By the way, they played the game by the book.

291
00:10:27,550 --> 00:10:29,824
- They're playing it by the book. - They are indeed.

292
00:10:34,220 --> 00:10:37,799
(They clap to cheer him on for 3 seconds.)

293
00:10:38,190 --> 00:10:39,455
They are even clapping.

294
00:10:41,100 --> 00:10:44,099
(His posture is stable as if he's lying on his bed.)

295
00:10:44,100 --> 00:10:45,834
- There you go. - This part isn't touching!

296
00:10:46,100 --> 00:10:47,365
This is totally by the book.

297
00:10:47,540 --> 00:10:50,253
- I'm serious. - Their postures are perfect.

298
00:10:51,170 --> 00:10:53,210
(He's at ease.)

299
00:10:53,269 --> 00:10:54,841
He's like a master.

300
00:10:54,879 --> 00:10:57,138
- There you go! - Lift your head up!

301
00:10:57,139 --> 00:10:59,291
(These new recruits are putting on a fierce battle of masters.)

302
00:10:59,879 --> 00:11:02,748
(As they hold precise postures from start to finish,)

303
00:11:02,749 --> 00:11:05,473
(he finishes the 1st verse.)

304
00:11:06,389 --> 00:11:07,991
- There you go. - Is it over?

305
00:11:08,119 --> 00:11:09,219
What's the score?

306
00:11:09,220 --> 00:11:12,689
(Their postures were perfect. What's their score?)

307
00:11:12,690 --> 00:11:13,829
What's the score?

308
00:11:13,830 --> 00:11:15,728
(Team SORAN's score is...)

309
00:11:15,729 --> 00:11:18,044
(53 points.)

310
00:11:18,700 --> 00:11:21,669
(It's almost twice higher than Team Nucksal and Code Kunst's.)

311
00:11:21,670 --> 00:11:22,799
- That's a high score. - Well done.

312
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:24,209
(We did it!)

313
00:11:24,210 --> 00:11:25,569
- They were amazing. - They were perfect.

314
00:11:25,570 --> 00:11:26,868
(Even the other teams approve. They were perfect.)

315
00:11:26,869 --> 00:11:28,638
We'll reveal their final score.

316
00:11:28,639 --> 00:11:30,169
They earned 53 points.

317
00:11:30,509 --> 00:11:31,608
And as for deductions...

318
00:11:31,609 --> 00:11:33,209
(Deductions...)

319
00:11:33,210 --> 00:11:34,349
There are none.

320
00:11:34,350 --> 00:11:36,390
(There are no deductions.)

321
00:11:36,950 --> 00:11:39,789
(The final score is 53.)

322
00:11:39,790 --> 00:11:41,618
- I agree. There were no deductions. - My gosh. They were...

323
00:11:41,619 --> 00:11:43,018
- They played by the book. - Right.

324
00:11:43,019 --> 00:11:45,335
I've never seen people who followed the rules perfectly.

325
00:11:45,359 --> 00:11:47,158
You have to do whatever it takes.

326
00:11:47,159 --> 00:11:48,228
Their teamwork is perfect.

327
00:11:48,229 --> 00:11:50,300
You should have them vet the game before we film.

328
00:11:50,700 --> 00:11:52,868
- Seriously. Incorporated SORAN... - Hey.

329
00:11:52,869 --> 00:11:54,125
makes the perfect team.

330
00:11:54,540 --> 00:11:56,101
- Good job. - Nice!

331
00:11:56,200 --> 00:11:57,290
Sit down.

332
00:11:57,840 --> 00:11:59,439
All right. As for this team,

333
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:01,778
there are three members which is perfect for this game.

334
00:12:01,779 --> 00:12:03,065
- Right. - Yes.

335
00:12:03,210 --> 00:12:05,508
One of them is trying so hard to cling onto this team.

336
00:12:05,509 --> 00:12:08,049
"Cling"? How could you say that?

337
00:12:08,050 --> 00:12:10,191
- I thought he was their agent. - Agent?

338
00:12:10,379 --> 00:12:12,589
When they say that I'll get kicked out, you should...

339
00:12:12,590 --> 00:12:14,457
- deny that. - I kept denying it. I did.

340
00:12:14,820 --> 00:12:15,919
This team will stay as it is to the end.

341
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:17,113
- Watch. I'm serious. - Okay.

342
00:12:17,290 --> 00:12:19,533
- Here I go. I'll take it seriously. - Okay.

343
00:12:19,759 --> 00:12:23,559
(As he hopes to stay in the team, he throws the dice.)

344
00:12:23,560 --> 00:12:25,058
- Stomach and feet. - Back and feet.

345
00:12:25,229 --> 00:12:28,637
(Stomach and feet, feet and back, and stomach and feet)

346
00:12:29,070 --> 00:12:30,669
(Everyone is anticipating Team Gummy's song pick.)

347
00:12:30,670 --> 00:12:32,069
It's starting. It started.

348
00:12:32,070 --> 00:12:33,335
"Unreasonable Reason".

349
00:12:33,409 --> 00:12:34,478
We can do this.

350
00:12:34,479 --> 00:12:35,735
I just have to lift my body, right?

351
00:12:36,739 --> 00:12:38,719
- Okay. - Hey, you can grab my feet.

352
00:12:39,249 --> 00:12:40,607
Yes, you can grab my feet.

353
00:12:40,749 --> 00:12:42,963
- She's really close. - My gosh.

354
00:12:43,050 --> 00:12:45,349
- There you go. - She's over the microphone.

355
00:12:45,350 --> 00:12:46,919
- It's because he's tall. - Right.

356
00:12:46,920 --> 00:12:49,089
- She is over the microphone. - Kwang Soo is contributing a lot.

357
00:12:49,090 --> 00:12:50,388
My gosh, she's at the microphone.

358
00:12:50,389 --> 00:12:51,583
Gosh, what is this?

359
00:12:51,830 --> 00:12:52,858
My feet have to touch.

360
00:12:52,859 --> 00:12:54,492
- I'm set. Okay. - She can reach the microphone.

361
00:12:54,629 --> 00:12:57,228
- Kwang Soo is amazing. - This is no joke.

362
00:12:57,229 --> 00:12:58,469
Kwang Soo contributed a lot.

363
00:12:58,470 --> 00:12:59,768
(It's a mix of Athletic Jong Kook, Tall Kwang Soo,)

364
00:12:59,769 --> 00:13:00,963
(and the Queen of Singers, Gummy.)

365
00:13:00,999 --> 00:13:02,499
This is like a concert.

366
00:13:03,470 --> 00:13:05,510
(What an amazing combination!)

367
00:13:06,340 --> 00:13:08,839
(Her scatting is enough to turn this place into a concert venue.)

368
00:13:08,840 --> 00:13:09,978
This is unfair.

369
00:13:09,979 --> 00:13:11,682
(My gosh, Gummy is singing really well!)

370
00:13:12,210 --> 00:13:13,402
Hey, don't shake!

371
00:13:13,810 --> 00:13:14,942
Don't shake me!

372
00:13:15,779 --> 00:13:17,689
(They forget about the mission for the moment...)

373
00:13:17,690 --> 00:13:20,750
(and begin enjoying the performance.)

374
00:13:22,389 --> 00:13:25,286
(Her voice and singing skills give them goosebumps.)

375
00:13:25,359 --> 00:13:28,869
- If you try to leave me - She's incredible.

376
00:13:29,359 --> 00:13:32,796
(When you said you loved me)

377
00:13:32,899 --> 00:13:35,339
(With the complete support from Jong Kook and Kwang Soo,)

378
00:13:35,340 --> 00:13:37,960
(she only focuses on her singing at ease.)

379
00:13:38,409 --> 00:13:41,266
(The song excites everyone.)

380
00:13:41,979 --> 00:13:44,294
(Given her singing skills, we'll definitely win 1st place.)

381
00:13:44,580 --> 00:13:46,179
Gummy, your hands are touching.

382
00:13:46,180 --> 00:13:47,301
(Only her stomach and feet can touch.)

383
00:13:47,519 --> 00:13:48,948
(Her hands are touching the floor.)

384
00:13:49,450 --> 00:13:50,789
(As she's too focused, she can't hear him.)

385
00:13:50,790 --> 00:13:51,789
Your hands!

386
00:13:51,790 --> 00:13:53,278
Gummy, you have to lift your hands!

387
00:13:53,820 --> 00:13:55,758
- Her hands are touching. - You must take off your hands!

388
00:13:55,759 --> 00:13:57,319
They'll get a lot of deductions.

389
00:13:57,320 --> 00:13:59,370
- Ji Yeon, take off your hands! - Your hands!

390
00:13:59,529 --> 00:14:02,488
Ji Yeon, you must take off your hands!

391
00:14:02,499 --> 00:14:03,826
She can't hear you.

392
00:14:03,899 --> 00:14:05,226
Yes, there you go. Lift your hands.

393
00:14:06,570 --> 00:14:08,638
- You can't hold the microphone. - No holding the microphone.

394
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:09,691
Why not?

395
00:14:10,070 --> 00:14:12,997
Look! She's holding it. She's holding it. Count the seconds!

396
00:14:13,409 --> 00:14:15,786
(She's still holding on to the microphone.)

397
00:14:16,509 --> 00:14:17,908
(Unfortunately, she finishes the 1st verse...)

398
00:14:17,909 --> 00:14:20,909
(while holding onto the microphone to the end.)

399
00:14:22,119 --> 00:14:23,349
What's the score?

400
00:14:23,350 --> 00:14:24,618
(Although her hands were touching...)

401
00:14:24,619 --> 00:14:25,742
That was hard.

402
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:29,459
(How many points did she get from the karaoke machine?)

403
00:14:29,460 --> 00:14:31,193
(That's amazing! Their jaws drop open.)

404
00:14:31,690 --> 00:14:34,699
(What on earth is her score?)

405
00:14:34,700 --> 00:14:36,898
- Okay! We won. - 84 points.

406
00:14:36,899 --> 00:14:38,531
(Team Gummy gets 84 points.)

407
00:14:38,930 --> 00:14:40,669
(We still have a shot even if we get deductions.)

408
00:14:40,670 --> 00:14:42,268
- You'll lose a lot of points. - But we'll lose points.

409
00:14:42,269 --> 00:14:43,596
- That's all right. - All right.

410
00:14:43,700 --> 00:14:45,669
Your score is 84 points.

411
00:14:45,670 --> 00:14:48,771
Your hands touched for a minute. So the final score is 24 points.

412
00:14:48,909 --> 00:14:51,049
(The final score is 24 points.)

413
00:14:51,050 --> 00:14:52,304
We deducted 60 points.

414
00:14:52,379 --> 00:14:54,562
- Your hands were touching. - You deducted 60 points?

415
00:14:54,820 --> 00:14:56,778
Really? You should have told me.

416
00:14:56,779 --> 00:14:57,949
We kept telling you.

417
00:14:57,950 --> 00:14:59,518
- We kept yelling, - I can't believe this.

418
00:14:59,519 --> 00:15:01,689
- "Hands, hands!" - I'm sorry.

419
00:15:01,690 --> 00:15:03,919
(Yelling at her was harder than getting into the positions.)

420
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:05,689
You should have looked around.

421
00:15:05,690 --> 00:15:07,388
- We yelled a lot. - I didn't hear anything at all.

422
00:15:07,389 --> 00:15:09,266
Ji Yeon is perfect,

423
00:15:09,399 --> 00:15:11,103
but she's not good at playing games.

424
00:15:11,430 --> 00:15:12,829
- By the way, Ji Yeon, - Yes?

425
00:15:12,830 --> 00:15:14,532
where did you get your slippers? They are so nice.

426
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:18,268
- They look like traditional socks. - I love your slippers.

427
00:15:18,269 --> 00:15:19,768
- Oh, no. - I do.

428
00:15:20,840 --> 00:15:23,238
- You should've told me sooner. - Great.

429
00:15:23,239 --> 00:15:25,549
Eun Ji, Ha Young, and Na Eun will give it a try.

430
00:15:25,550 --> 00:15:27,446
Eun Ji, do a good job and take me from this team!

431
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:29,778
- Eun Ji. - Yes?

432
00:15:29,779 --> 00:15:31,278
Win the game and take me to your team!

433
00:15:31,649 --> 00:15:32,813
Okay.

434
00:15:35,090 --> 00:15:37,742
Ha Young, take me from this team!

435
00:15:38,629 --> 00:15:39,789
(Who is that again?)

436
00:15:39,790 --> 00:15:40,983
I'll throw the dice.

437
00:15:41,129 --> 00:15:42,299
Ha Young.

438
00:15:42,300 --> 00:15:44,929
(They throw the dice to select the body parts that can touch.)

439
00:15:44,930 --> 00:15:46,268
- Head. - All right.

440
00:15:46,269 --> 00:15:47,839
(Head, hands, and stomach)

441
00:15:47,840 --> 00:15:49,998
(Back and head, hands and stomach, and stomach and feet)

442
00:15:49,999 --> 00:15:51,234
Let's do this!

443
00:15:52,009 --> 00:15:54,478
(Apink chooses their song.)

444
00:15:54,479 --> 00:15:55,638
(It's "Tears" by So Chan Whee.)

445
00:15:55,639 --> 00:15:57,138
- It's "Tears" by So Chan Whee. - They picked that?

446
00:15:57,239 --> 00:15:58,576
- Is it "Tears"? - That's amazing.

447
00:15:58,680 --> 00:15:59,801
I want to hear them sing.

448
00:16:00,149 --> 00:16:01,271
Hurry up!

449
00:16:01,550 --> 00:16:03,148
Ha Young, go farther.

450
00:16:03,149 --> 00:16:04,518
- More, more, more. - They might succeed.

451
00:16:04,519 --> 00:16:07,202
You can go farther down. Come up.

452
00:16:07,320 --> 00:16:10,289
Come up. Okay, okay.

453
00:16:10,290 --> 00:16:11,689
That's her hair.

454
00:16:11,690 --> 00:16:14,250
(He pulls on her hair.)

455
00:16:15,899 --> 00:16:19,266
(Is this the most comfortable they can be?)

456
00:16:19,430 --> 00:16:20,755
Here we go.

457
00:16:22,470 --> 00:16:24,172
(The microphone is too high.)

458
00:16:25,170 --> 00:16:27,148
(There's a leak.)

459
00:16:27,639 --> 00:16:30,309
If you don't touch it, you'll lose points.

460
00:16:30,310 --> 00:16:31,908
Na Eun doesn't want to grab her foot.

461
00:16:31,909 --> 00:16:33,338
Why not?

462
00:16:33,710 --> 00:16:35,485
- You're doing well. - You're doing well!

463
00:16:35,580 --> 00:16:37,355
Come a bit closer.

464
00:16:37,889 --> 00:16:39,786
Na Eun is hilarious.

465
00:16:41,320 --> 00:16:42,758
(Eun Ji's voice is stable.)

466
00:16:42,759 --> 00:16:44,189
- That's great! - Good work!

467
00:16:44,190 --> 00:16:45,210
(He's impressed.)

468
00:16:46,529 --> 00:16:47,753
The microphone is going down!

469
00:16:49,460 --> 00:16:52,325
(The microphone helps her sing better.)

470
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:56,221
(The microphone helped her.)

471
00:16:56,470 --> 00:16:58,479
Here we go!

472
00:16:58,639 --> 00:16:59,768
Let's go!

473
00:16:59,769 --> 00:17:01,278
(Let's enjoy this!)

474
00:17:01,279 --> 00:17:02,911
Don't call me

475
00:17:02,940 --> 00:17:04,786
A heartless woman

476
00:17:06,350 --> 00:17:08,549
(She sings well despite the unfavorable circumstances.)

477
00:17:08,550 --> 00:17:09,742
She's really good.

478
00:17:10,179 --> 00:17:12,148
Don't forget

479
00:17:12,149 --> 00:17:13,985
My love

480
00:17:15,419 --> 00:17:18,928
(She sings the high note.)

481
00:17:18,929 --> 00:17:22,029
(They forget that it's a competition and enjoy themselves.)

482
00:17:22,030 --> 00:17:25,191
(Even Code Kunst responds.)

483
00:17:25,629 --> 00:17:29,139
(This is their second time enjoying such a great performance.)

484
00:17:29,340 --> 00:17:31,339
(Her struggling team members...)

485
00:17:31,340 --> 00:17:35,083
(also gain strength through her amazing voice.)

486
00:17:36,879 --> 00:17:40,208
(She ends the song perfectly.)

487
00:17:40,209 --> 00:17:41,249
That was great.

488
00:17:41,250 --> 00:17:42,983
(Gummy approves.)

489
00:17:43,320 --> 00:17:44,371
That was great.

490
00:17:46,949 --> 00:17:48,158
(How well did they do?)

491
00:17:48,159 --> 00:17:50,639
- That's so amazing! - That's incredible!

492
00:17:53,929 --> 00:17:54,958
Great job!

493
00:17:54,959 --> 00:17:56,398
(Will you sing another song?)

494
00:17:56,399 --> 00:17:57,553
We got 98 points!

495
00:17:58,230 --> 00:17:59,321
That's amazing!

496
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,243
That's incredible! Good job!

497
00:18:02,340 --> 00:18:03,569
- My gosh. - That was excellent.

498
00:18:03,570 --> 00:18:04,936
Ha Young, good job.

499
00:18:05,270 --> 00:18:07,208
- Good job, Ha Young. - Good work.

500
00:18:07,209 --> 00:18:09,039
- You did so well. - Na Eun, gosh!

501
00:18:09,040 --> 00:18:11,456
Here is the final result.

502
00:18:11,780 --> 00:18:13,106
They received 98 points.

503
00:18:13,850 --> 00:18:16,501
But Na Eun's thighs kept touching the ground, so we'll deduct some.

504
00:18:17,050 --> 00:18:18,089
No, they weren't.

505
00:18:18,090 --> 00:18:20,849
We will deduct 30 points.

506
00:18:20,850 --> 00:18:22,958
(They get a 30-point deduction?)

507
00:18:22,959 --> 00:18:25,229
Your score is 68 points. You're still in 1st place.

508
00:18:25,230 --> 00:18:30,157
(Team Apink comes 1st place.)

509
00:18:30,530 --> 00:18:32,368
You guys sang so well.

510
00:18:32,369 --> 00:18:34,128
(The 1st 2 winning teams can switch teammates.)

511
00:18:34,129 --> 00:18:35,239
- Eun Ji! - Yes?

512
00:18:35,240 --> 00:18:36,260
Don't forget!

513
00:18:37,770 --> 00:18:40,565
(Guys, don't forget that I'm here!)

514
00:18:40,939 --> 00:18:42,079
That was incredible.

515
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:43,365
(We'll keep you in mind.)

516
00:18:44,379 --> 00:18:45,779
(Change One, Change Both)

517
00:18:45,780 --> 00:18:47,509
(If even 1 member picks a different card, they'll switch.)

518
00:18:47,510 --> 00:18:50,131
The winning team will pick their cards.

519
00:18:50,280 --> 00:18:51,289
Here we go.

520
00:18:51,290 --> 00:18:52,448
(The team switching begins.)

521
00:18:52,449 --> 00:18:55,417
1, 2, 3.

522
00:18:57,119 --> 00:18:58,158
- What? - What?

523
00:18:58,159 --> 00:18:59,789
(Jae Seok and Haha both choose Change Both.)

524
00:18:59,790 --> 00:19:03,928
(If Eun Ji also picks that card, the team will be maintained.)

525
00:19:03,929 --> 00:19:06,653
(What's her card?)

526
00:19:08,469 --> 00:19:11,039
(She picks Change One.)

527
00:19:11,040 --> 00:19:12,138
- What? - What?

528
00:19:12,139 --> 00:19:13,309
(Change Both: 2, Change One: 1)

529
00:19:13,310 --> 00:19:14,378
- They're different. - Okay!

530
00:19:14,379 --> 00:19:16,279
- Change One. - Change One.

531
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:17,565
My gosh.

532
00:19:18,510 --> 00:19:20,141
- Change One? - Do we change one member?

533
00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:23,289
- Are you serious? - Look at Se Chan.

534
00:19:24,119 --> 00:19:25,789
(Apink, are you watching me?)

535
00:19:25,790 --> 00:19:27,418
- Look at him. - He's waiting.

536
00:19:27,419 --> 00:19:28,519
What is this?

537
00:19:28,520 --> 00:19:31,829
Since Eun Ji chose a different one, she'll pick.

538
00:19:31,830 --> 00:19:35,266
There's someone who doesn't look like they belong there.

539
00:19:35,560 --> 00:19:38,299
I see one person.

540
00:19:38,300 --> 00:19:40,668
(Why is everyone looking at me?)

541
00:19:40,669 --> 00:19:42,739
- What? - He realized that it's him.

542
00:19:42,740 --> 00:19:44,228
By the way, Ji Yeon.

543
00:19:44,540 --> 00:19:46,815
Why were you looking at your feet?

544
00:19:47,070 --> 00:19:48,875
I was thinking, "No!"

545
00:19:49,780 --> 00:19:51,891
- Right. - Are you sure about that?

546
00:19:52,250 --> 00:19:53,908
- I mean... - Why didn't you say it?

547
00:19:53,909 --> 00:19:55,178
I said something.

548
00:19:55,179 --> 00:19:56,878
- She's so kind. - That's why I was doing this.

549
00:19:56,879 --> 00:19:58,889
She really is kind.

550
00:19:59,350 --> 00:20:00,418
Then...

551
00:20:00,419 --> 00:20:01,858
(Which one of them will be expelled?)

552
00:20:01,859 --> 00:20:04,104
- I'm fine either way. - Good work, Haha.

553
00:20:04,429 --> 00:20:06,229
- Good work, guys. - Judging by the combination...

554
00:20:06,230 --> 00:20:07,259
- I'm a fan. - Right?

555
00:20:07,260 --> 00:20:08,428
- You know that, right? - Right?

556
00:20:08,429 --> 00:20:09,858
If you're too happy about this,

557
00:20:09,859 --> 00:20:11,257
- we'll bring you back. - I'm not happy.

558
00:20:11,469 --> 00:20:12,769
I like you guys.

559
00:20:12,770 --> 00:20:15,799
If you're being too happy, we'll bring you back.

560
00:20:17,340 --> 00:20:18,736
What's wrong with you?

561
00:20:20,439 --> 00:20:22,378
- Calm down. - Look at her.

562
00:20:22,379 --> 00:20:23,579
She has a temper.

563
00:20:23,580 --> 00:20:26,108
She doesn't know when to back down.

564
00:20:26,109 --> 00:20:27,476
This is a new character.

565
00:20:27,609 --> 00:20:30,027
- She doesn't know when to stop. - Where have you been all along?

566
00:20:30,280 --> 00:20:31,718
Apink, go.

567
00:20:31,719 --> 00:20:32,912
- Over there. - Is it our turn?

568
00:20:33,290 --> 00:20:35,361
- The parasite. - "Parasite"?

569
00:20:35,719 --> 00:20:38,076
(Are you talking about me?)

570
00:20:38,830 --> 00:20:40,188
- She's talking about the movie. - "Parasite"?

571
00:20:40,189 --> 00:20:42,428
- Yes, the movie. - She's talking about the movie.

572
00:20:42,429 --> 00:20:43,729
This is a parasite.

573
00:20:43,730 --> 00:20:45,499
(A group of people living in unsuitable environments)

574
00:20:45,500 --> 00:20:46,551
"Parasite"?

575
00:20:46,969 --> 00:20:47,999
- Come on. - I'm talking about the movie.

576
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:49,702
Did you seriously call me a parasite?

577
00:20:50,270 --> 00:20:52,339
Apink, pick. 1, 2, 3.

578
00:20:52,340 --> 00:20:53,461
- Lee Kwang Soo. - Lee Kwang Soo.

579
00:20:53,810 --> 00:20:55,676
- Okay. - Gosh.

580
00:20:56,040 --> 00:20:58,208
- Oh, no. - Oh, no.

581
00:20:58,209 --> 00:21:00,453
- Hey. - It's Kwang Soo!

582
00:21:02,050 --> 00:21:03,178
(Welcome)

583
00:21:03,179 --> 00:21:04,199
This is great.

584
00:21:06,419 --> 00:21:08,218
(When will you call my name?)

585
00:21:08,219 --> 00:21:09,789
Team SORAN, please pick your cards.

586
00:21:09,790 --> 00:21:11,529
1, 2...

587
00:21:11,530 --> 00:21:13,059
(Will they switch or maintain?)

588
00:21:13,060 --> 00:21:14,080
Three.

589
00:21:15,800 --> 00:21:16,898
Change One.

590
00:21:16,899 --> 00:21:18,829
(Change Both: 2 Change One: 1)

591
00:21:18,830 --> 00:21:20,269
(Se Chan chooses Change One.)

592
00:21:20,270 --> 00:21:22,106
Who is it? Oh, it's me.

593
00:21:22,270 --> 00:21:24,137
- Hey. - I picked the wrong card. Really.

594
00:21:25,510 --> 00:21:27,478
(You're so mean.)

595
00:21:27,939 --> 00:21:30,734
To be honest,

596
00:21:31,109 --> 00:21:33,408
this team needs someone who'll stick with them.

597
00:21:33,409 --> 00:21:35,378
Hey, if you're talking about me, I refuse.

598
00:21:35,379 --> 00:21:37,797
I pretty much became one with Code Kunst.

599
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:39,589
- I'm serious. - Don't lie.

600
00:21:39,590 --> 00:21:42,458
Please say something!

601
00:21:42,459 --> 00:21:43,887
- We didn't become one. - Hold on.

602
00:21:44,060 --> 00:21:45,989
Hey, I'm not the only one. There's also Ji Hyo and him.

603
00:21:45,990 --> 00:21:47,759
No, Se Chan. You belong in that team.

604
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:52,968
If Seok Jin goes over there, they'll be called KORAN.

605
00:21:52,969 --> 00:21:56,638
All right, then. Let's create KORAN.

606
00:21:56,639 --> 00:21:58,108
(He chooses Seok Jin.)

607
00:21:58,109 --> 00:22:01,506
Seok Jin! Code Kunst is loving this.

608
00:22:01,909 --> 00:22:03,208
He's so happy.

609
00:22:03,209 --> 00:22:05,749
(Seok Jin and Se Chan switch places.)

610
00:22:05,750 --> 00:22:07,349
- Hey, aren't you being too happy? - Okay.

611
00:22:07,350 --> 00:22:09,878
- I'm just making it enjoyable. - SORAN!

612
00:22:09,879 --> 00:22:10,918
(He quickly lets go of his former team.)

613
00:22:10,919 --> 00:22:13,541
He didn't even look back.

614
00:22:15,290 --> 00:22:16,589
- We did it! - Let's go.

615
00:22:16,590 --> 00:22:17,658
Look.

616
00:22:17,659 --> 00:22:19,903
If I move to Gummy's team, it'll be a Grand Slam.

617
00:22:21,030 --> 00:22:23,956
- You're right. - I'm going to join that team.

618
00:22:24,159 --> 00:22:26,198
Once I go there, it's game over.

619
00:22:26,199 --> 00:22:27,526
He's right.

620
00:22:27,669 --> 00:22:29,938
- If he comes here, it's all over. - He's hilarious.

621
00:22:29,939 --> 00:22:31,266
(Current Partners)

622
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:33,269
What is this?

623
00:22:33,270 --> 00:22:35,108
That's deep. I almost slipped.

624
00:22:35,109 --> 00:22:36,178
It looks cool.

625
00:22:36,179 --> 00:22:38,779
It may be hot out, but the water is still cold.

626
00:22:38,780 --> 00:22:39,849
What is this?

627
00:22:39,850 --> 00:22:42,369
We need to fall in. Or maybe we need to stop midway.

628
00:22:42,919 --> 00:22:44,858
- Wait. - It's quite deep.

629
00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:47,182
Look at Code Kunst.

630
00:22:47,719 --> 00:22:49,218
(He shows a V.)

631
00:22:49,590 --> 00:22:51,803
He didn't play around like this with Seok Jin.

632
00:22:52,189 --> 00:22:54,474
- He became brighter. - I think it has finally begun.

633
00:22:54,830 --> 00:22:56,259
This feels like our very first game.

634
00:22:56,260 --> 00:22:57,759
Seok Jin is behind you.

635
00:22:58,699 --> 00:23:00,029
(Staring)

636
00:23:00,030 --> 00:23:01,254
So what? What can he do?

637
00:23:02,300 --> 00:23:03,320
He's hilarious.

638
00:23:03,639 --> 00:23:05,506
- He's so brave. - "What can he do?"

639
00:23:06,770 --> 00:23:08,616
- He can't hold back any longer. - Be patient. I'll come back.

640
00:23:09,340 --> 00:23:10,479
(I'm just kidding.)

641
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:12,927
By the way, Nucksal and Code Kunst are finally looking stable...

642
00:23:13,080 --> 00:23:14,749
now that Se Chan has joined the group.

643
00:23:14,750 --> 00:23:15,749
- I know. - You're right.

644
00:23:15,750 --> 00:23:17,448
- They changed. - They're finally smiling.

645
00:23:17,449 --> 00:23:18,688
I had no idea...

646
00:23:18,689 --> 00:23:20,388
how mischievous Code Kunst could be.

647
00:23:20,389 --> 00:23:22,789
He shows reactions. He's become so much brighter.

648
00:23:22,790 --> 00:23:24,799
- I did the same before as well. - Did what?

649
00:23:24,929 --> 00:23:26,490
- I joked around. - You joked around?

650
00:23:26,659 --> 00:23:29,398
But he told me to stay put.

651
00:23:29,399 --> 00:23:30,829
(Seok Jin banned him from playing around.)

652
00:23:30,830 --> 00:23:33,074
- Seok Jin said that? - He did?

653
00:23:33,429 --> 00:23:35,173
- Was he lording over him? - How could you do that?

654
00:23:35,240 --> 00:23:37,177
He told me to sit down because everyone else was standing.

655
00:23:38,340 --> 00:23:40,920
(He forced his surviving tips onto him.)

656
00:23:41,040 --> 00:23:42,039
That was funny.

657
00:23:42,040 --> 00:23:45,249
This is your last chance at picking your final partners.

658
00:23:45,250 --> 00:23:46,979
It's called Ride the Conveyor Belt and Answer.

659
00:23:46,980 --> 00:23:48,448
(Ride the Conveyor Belt and Answer)

660
00:23:49,280 --> 00:23:50,849
Two members from each team will participate.

661
00:23:50,850 --> 00:23:53,118
They will sit on this moving conveyor belt.

662
00:23:53,119 --> 00:23:55,740
They must complete the given, random missions.

663
00:23:56,459 --> 00:23:58,759
If they both succeed in making two rounds, they'll succeed.

664
00:23:58,760 --> 00:23:59,858
But if you fail midway,

665
00:23:59,859 --> 00:24:02,480
you will have to start from the beginning once again.

666
00:24:02,800 --> 00:24:03,880
It sounds difficult.

667
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:06,668
I will tell you what the four random missions are.

668
00:24:06,669 --> 00:24:08,698
First one is Color Game.

669
00:24:08,699 --> 00:24:10,097
- What is that? - What is that?

670
00:24:10,169 --> 00:24:12,839
If I say, "Red, blue, blue,"

671
00:24:12,840 --> 00:24:14,708
you must say, "apple, sea, sky".

672
00:24:14,709 --> 00:24:16,107
(Name things that are of those colors.)

673
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:18,493
- It sounds difficult. - It won't be easy.

674
00:24:18,649 --> 00:24:20,779
The second one is Lee Kwang Soo Game.

675
00:24:20,780 --> 00:24:22,075
- "Lee Kwang Soo Game"? - He has a game of his own?

676
00:24:22,280 --> 00:24:24,479
If I say, "gimbap," you must pick either "gim" or "bap".

677
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:25,718
In three seconds,

678
00:24:25,719 --> 00:24:27,759
you must answer what's opposite of mine.

679
00:24:28,159 --> 00:24:30,519
Look. Let's say he said, "a bus".

680
00:24:30,520 --> 00:24:31,589
- 1, 2, bus. - Bus.

681
00:24:31,590 --> 00:24:33,466
- Then you lose. - Got it.

682
00:24:33,889 --> 00:24:36,714
The third one is Speed Acrostic Poem.

683
00:24:36,959 --> 00:24:40,571
If I say, "Yu Jae Seok," you must make a logical poem.

684
00:24:40,600 --> 00:24:42,028
Elegant and fun...

685
00:24:42,570 --> 00:24:43,968
Elegant and fun...

686
00:24:43,969 --> 00:24:45,948
- Man. - Man.

687
00:24:46,510 --> 00:24:48,579
- It just needs to make sense? - If it makes sense, you succeed.

688
00:24:48,580 --> 00:24:51,160
You know Say It Backwards, right?

689
00:24:51,280 --> 00:24:52,349
Yes.

690
00:24:52,350 --> 00:24:54,009
Say it backwards. Piano.

691
00:24:54,010 --> 00:24:55,101
Anopi.

692
00:24:55,719 --> 00:24:57,688
- Noapi. - Noapi.

693
00:24:58,320 --> 00:25:00,430
If it's a wrong answer, please lower your voice.

694
00:25:01,320 --> 00:25:02,615
I was certain.

695
00:25:03,020 --> 00:25:04,388
Which team would like to go first?

696
00:25:04,389 --> 00:25:06,729
- Se Chan and Code Kunst, go. - What do you mean?

697
00:25:06,730 --> 00:25:08,229
- Go. - Se Chan and Code Kunst.

698
00:25:08,230 --> 00:25:09,329
Should we go? Are you ready?

699
00:25:09,330 --> 00:25:11,099
- Should we go first? - Code Kunst, go.

700
00:25:11,100 --> 00:25:12,293
Don't back away.

701
00:25:13,530 --> 00:25:15,799
(He nags and discourages him.)

702
00:25:15,800 --> 00:25:17,968
- Come on. - He got up.

703
00:25:17,969 --> 00:25:20,408
I was going to participate once you left our team.

704
00:25:20,409 --> 00:25:21,970
(He's now determined to win.)

705
00:25:23,379 --> 00:25:26,009
He's holding a grudge against Seok Jin.

706
00:25:26,010 --> 00:25:27,743
Don't try too hard.

707
00:25:27,750 --> 00:25:29,311
They might succeed at one go.

708
00:25:29,379 --> 00:25:30,849
- Right. - There's a chance.

709
00:25:31,080 --> 00:25:32,140
- Please! - All right.

710
00:25:32,449 --> 00:25:34,183
- Let's start with Code Kunst. - You can do it!

711
00:25:34,889 --> 00:25:36,489
- Watch me. - You must succeed!

712
00:25:36,490 --> 00:25:39,040
- He wants you to watch him. - I will. I'll watch you.

713
00:25:39,459 --> 00:25:40,489
Get ready.

714
00:25:40,490 --> 00:25:42,132
(He acts tough but prepares his body for the water.)

715
00:25:42,459 --> 00:25:44,162
Get ready, set, go.

716
00:25:44,659 --> 00:25:46,158
Lee Kwang Soo Game.

717
00:25:46,469 --> 00:25:48,099
Jjamppong. Jjam or ppong.

718
00:25:48,100 --> 00:25:49,968
1, 2, 3.

719
00:25:49,969 --> 00:25:52,208
- Jjam. - Ppong.

720
00:25:52,209 --> 00:25:53,668
Okay!

721
00:25:53,669 --> 00:25:54,979
(1 down, 3 to go.)

722
00:25:54,980 --> 00:25:57,692
Speed Acrostic Poem. Son Na Eun.

723
00:25:57,780 --> 00:26:00,768
Son Na Eun secretly thinks I'm attractive.

724
00:26:01,149 --> 00:26:02,779
Okay!

725
00:26:02,780 --> 00:26:05,789
(Son Na Eun secretly thinks I'm attractive.)

726
00:26:05,790 --> 00:26:06,789
I approve.

727
00:26:06,790 --> 00:26:08,489
(They pass the second round.)

728
00:26:08,490 --> 00:26:10,388
Speed Acrostic Poem with Yu Jae Seok.

729
00:26:10,389 --> 00:26:12,559
(Speed Acrostic Poem: Yu Jae Seok)

730
00:26:12,560 --> 00:26:15,999
Yu Jae Seok isn't as funny as Seok Jin.

731
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:18,868
(Yu Jae Seok isn't as funny as Seok Jin.)

732
00:26:18,869 --> 00:26:20,229
(Speed Acrostic Poem: Yu Jae Seok)

733
00:26:20,230 --> 00:26:22,499
(Has Code Kunst mastered variety shows?)

734
00:26:22,500 --> 00:26:24,099
(They only have one more game to complete.)

735
00:26:24,100 --> 00:26:25,976
Color Game. Red, red, yellow.

736
00:26:26,770 --> 00:26:30,247
(Color Game: Red, red, yellow)

737
00:26:31,010 --> 00:26:33,249
Kimchi stew, apple, and...

738
00:26:33,250 --> 00:26:35,321
(Color Game: Red, red, yellow)

739
00:26:36,149 --> 00:26:37,914
Just keep going!

740
00:26:38,080 --> 00:26:40,130
Color Game. Red, yellow, blue.

741
00:26:40,889 --> 00:26:42,089
Kimchi stew...

742
00:26:42,090 --> 00:26:44,303
(Code Kunst couldn't hold on any longer.)

743
00:26:45,260 --> 00:26:47,911
(He gets the full course variety show treatment.)

744
00:26:48,129 --> 00:26:50,099
(They're laughing their heads off.)

745
00:26:50,760 --> 00:26:53,421
Red, yellow, and... Darn it.

746
00:26:53,830 --> 00:26:56,420
(He takes a bath after grunting at the world.)

747
00:26:58,040 --> 00:26:59,569
(They almost made it though.)

748
00:26:59,570 --> 00:27:00,569
Is it over then?

749
00:27:00,570 --> 00:27:01,938
This is too hard.

750
00:27:01,939 --> 00:27:03,579
It's not easy at all.

751
00:27:03,580 --> 00:27:05,650
You guys were great though.

752
00:27:05,679 --> 00:27:07,484
We almost made it.

753
00:27:07,649 --> 00:27:09,282
We'll go next.

754
00:27:09,480 --> 00:27:11,789
The Tank Sisters. Nam Joo and...

755
00:27:11,790 --> 00:27:13,452
- Cho Rong. - Right.

756
00:27:14,250 --> 00:27:16,059
If you actually do this...

757
00:27:16,060 --> 00:27:17,825
- Hold on. - I can't wait.

758
00:27:17,990 --> 00:27:19,458
We can end it in this round.

759
00:27:19,560 --> 00:27:21,804
- We can win. - It's perfectly doable!

760
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:23,059
(Pondering)

761
00:27:23,060 --> 00:27:25,868
- Do we play one round each? - Nam Joo, fold your legs.

762
00:27:25,869 --> 00:27:27,999
- What? - Do we play one round each?

763
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:29,039
- No, twice. - I don't get it.

764
00:27:29,040 --> 00:27:31,299
You have to play two rounds each.

765
00:27:31,300 --> 00:27:32,769
If you get it wrong, you have to start over.

766
00:27:32,770 --> 00:27:35,378
I like how you're out there despite not knowing the rules.

767
00:27:35,379 --> 00:27:36,460
I love it.

768
00:27:36,679 --> 00:27:37,678
Just do as you wish!

769
00:27:37,679 --> 00:27:39,378
You are the Tank Sisters!

770
00:27:39,379 --> 00:27:40,940
- Gosh. - Just drive on.

771
00:27:41,080 --> 00:27:42,148
They don't even know the rules.

772
00:27:42,149 --> 00:27:43,609
- Get ready. - The Tank Sisters.

773
00:27:44,580 --> 00:27:46,996
Ready, go!

774
00:27:47,389 --> 00:27:50,959
Say It Backwards. Scandal.

775
00:27:51,119 --> 00:27:53,059
- "Ladnacs". - Nice.

776
00:27:53,060 --> 00:27:54,259
(1st round complete)

777
00:27:54,260 --> 00:27:55,759
- Nice. - That was great.

778
00:27:56,129 --> 00:27:57,762
Speed Acrostic Poem with Yu Jae Seok.

779
00:27:58,159 --> 00:27:59,729
Yu Jae Seok, Jae Seok...

780
00:27:59,730 --> 00:28:01,499
(Speed Acrostic Poem: Yu Jae Seok)

781
00:28:01,500 --> 00:28:03,839
Hey, you're better looking than Seok Jin!

782
00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:06,420
(Hey, you're better looking than Seok Jin!)

783
00:28:06,740 --> 00:28:09,208
Unbelievable. She's just throwing about words.

784
00:28:09,209 --> 00:28:12,049
Back to the start. Color Game. Red, yellow, blue.

785
00:28:12,050 --> 00:28:14,279
Kimchi, banana, water.

786
00:28:14,280 --> 00:28:15,646
- Nice. - You've got this!

787
00:28:15,649 --> 00:28:18,178
Lee Kwang Soo Game. Pajeon. "Pa" or "jeon".

788
00:28:18,179 --> 00:28:19,188
- Jeon! - 1, 2, 3.

789
00:28:19,189 --> 00:28:20,188
(Why are you saying it first?)

790
00:28:20,189 --> 00:28:21,188
- Jeon! - Jeon!

791
00:28:21,189 --> 00:28:22,489
That's not it!

792
00:28:22,490 --> 00:28:23,688
(She proves that she doesn't know the rules.)

793
00:28:23,689 --> 00:28:24,740
Seriously?

794
00:28:24,990 --> 00:28:26,059
Hey!

795
00:28:26,060 --> 00:28:28,610
- Tank Sisters! - Do you not care about winning?

796
00:28:29,730 --> 00:28:31,698
Speed Acrostic Poem with Kim Jong Kook.

797
00:28:31,699 --> 00:28:34,198
(Falling and screaming!)

798
00:28:34,199 --> 00:28:36,688
(She screams at the top of her lungs.)

799
00:28:37,300 --> 00:28:39,819
(Cho Rong is scared amid of all that.)

800
00:28:40,510 --> 00:28:41,867
Unbelievable.

801
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:44,579
Gosh, this is scary. Mom!

802
00:28:44,580 --> 00:28:47,779
Are you guys kidding me?

803
00:28:47,780 --> 00:28:50,401
How can she say the word first?

804
00:28:50,780 --> 00:28:51,948
It wasn't even a mind game.

805
00:28:51,949 --> 00:28:54,489
- I know. - What was she getting at?

806
00:28:54,490 --> 00:28:56,089
How can you just say your answer?

807
00:28:56,090 --> 00:28:57,486
Unbelievable.

808
00:28:57,689 --> 00:29:00,089
So next up is SORAN and...

809
00:29:00,090 --> 00:29:01,458
Sure, we'll go next.

810
00:29:01,459 --> 00:29:02,479
My teammates...

811
00:29:03,359 --> 00:29:04,450
Well, these two.

812
00:29:04,859 --> 00:29:06,729
(My teammates...)

813
00:29:06,730 --> 00:29:08,198
(Well, these two.)

814
00:29:08,199 --> 00:29:09,526
Have you forgotten their names?

815
00:29:09,669 --> 00:29:10,839
Really?

816
00:29:10,840 --> 00:29:12,239
(To Seok Jin, he's just a man in glasses.)

817
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:14,208
- What? - What's his name?

818
00:29:14,639 --> 00:29:16,108
He doesn't know his name?

819
00:29:16,109 --> 00:29:17,129
(CEO Jee doesn't care about his employees' names.)

820
00:29:17,980 --> 00:29:19,779
- Good luck. - Go, go!

821
00:29:19,780 --> 00:29:21,176
Even I feel sorry.

822
00:29:22,250 --> 00:29:24,218
If this team wins, Seok Jin will get the boot.

823
00:29:24,219 --> 00:29:25,953
I don't know to which team, but he'll be kicked out.

824
00:29:26,219 --> 00:29:27,546
Go, "Yang Bae".

825
00:29:27,649 --> 00:29:28,789
- Here we go. - I'm ready.

826
00:29:28,790 --> 00:29:30,118
So Min, good luck.

827
00:29:30,119 --> 00:29:31,388
(Seo Myun Ho, Lee Tae Wook, Pyeon Yu Il)

828
00:29:31,389 --> 00:29:33,532
Ready, go.

829
00:29:33,760 --> 00:29:36,045
Say It Backwards. The Netherlands.

830
00:29:36,859 --> 00:29:38,468
"Sdnal-Nether".

831
00:29:38,469 --> 00:29:39,999
(Incorrect)

832
00:29:40,270 --> 00:29:42,310
Say It Backwards. Shin Saimdang.

833
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:44,223
"Gnadmias Nihs".

834
00:29:44,600 --> 00:29:46,168
Speed Acrostic Poem with Jee Seok Jin.

835
00:29:46,169 --> 00:29:49,479
Jee Seok Jin truly hates Seok Jin.

836
00:29:49,480 --> 00:29:51,112
(Jee Seok Jin truly hates Seok Jin.)

837
00:29:51,379 --> 00:29:53,178
(They fail the 2nd round.)

838
00:29:53,179 --> 00:29:55,158
- What? - Gosh.

839
00:29:55,250 --> 00:29:56,607
Young Bae, come on.

840
00:29:57,379 --> 00:29:59,735
Say It Backwards. Africa.

841
00:29:59,990 --> 00:30:02,118
"Rica"... "Ricaf"...

842
00:30:02,119 --> 00:30:03,319
(Say It Backwards: Africa)

843
00:30:03,320 --> 00:30:04,358
(Rica!)

844
00:30:04,359 --> 00:30:06,229
(Ricaf!)

845
00:30:06,230 --> 00:30:08,658
(She spits out the incorrect answer as she throws herself.)

846
00:30:08,659 --> 00:30:11,128
(What was that wailing?)

847
00:30:11,129 --> 00:30:13,829
(Team SORAN fails its 1st attempt.)

848
00:30:13,830 --> 00:30:15,165
That was loud and bold.

849
00:30:15,199 --> 00:30:16,499
Four syllable words are difficult.

850
00:30:16,500 --> 00:30:18,785
- Say It Backwards is hard. - It's too difficult.

851
00:30:19,139 --> 00:30:21,468
Next up is Romantic Punch and Ant Man.

852
00:30:21,469 --> 00:30:23,408
- Good luck. - The game is on.

853
00:30:23,409 --> 00:30:24,408
- Okay. - Let's do this.

854
00:30:24,409 --> 00:30:25,948
Ready, go.

855
00:30:25,949 --> 00:30:27,613
Say It Backwards. Frog.

856
00:30:27,850 --> 00:30:28,940
"Gorf".

857
00:30:29,119 --> 00:30:30,986
Say It Backwards. Africa.

858
00:30:31,480 --> 00:30:33,254
(Laughing)

859
00:30:33,689 --> 00:30:35,423
(Africa, did you say?)

860
00:30:35,859 --> 00:30:36,858
Moving on!

861
00:30:36,859 --> 00:30:39,989
Lee Kwang Soo Game. Mushroom. "Mush" or "room". 1, 2, 3.

862
00:30:39,990 --> 00:30:41,958
- Mush. - Room.

863
00:30:41,959 --> 00:30:43,059

864
00:30:43,060 --> 00:30:46,628

866
00:30:47,730 --> 00:30:48,938
(Fails 2nd round)

867
00:30:48,939 --> 00:30:50,769
(I should've taken Haha's spot.)

868
00:30:50,770 --> 00:30:52,646
Say It Backwards. King Sejong.

869
00:30:52,810 --> 00:30:53,938
(Splash!)

870
00:30:53,939 --> 00:30:55,776
Say It Backwards. King Sejong.

871
00:30:55,840 --> 00:30:57,615
(He laughs when the question is too tricky.)

872
00:30:59,510 --> 00:31:01,926
(He's suddenly doing an impression of King Sejong.)

873
00:31:02,980 --> 00:31:05,049
(Why on earth does he keep on laughing?)

874
00:31:05,050 --> 00:31:06,789
(We're just as doomed.)

875
00:31:06,790 --> 00:31:09,166
Haha wasn't even participating.

876
00:31:09,659 --> 00:31:11,118
All he did was laugh the entire time.

877
00:31:11,119 --> 00:31:14,489
Now we're back to Nucksal and his sister.

878
00:31:14,490 --> 00:31:16,396
The two are so alike.

879
00:31:17,100 --> 00:31:18,283
- Let's go! - You've got this!

880
00:31:18,929 --> 00:31:21,499
Ready, go.

881
00:31:21,500 --> 00:31:23,947
Say It Backwards. South Korea.

882
00:31:24,570 --> 00:31:26,868
"Aerok Hyuos".

883
00:31:26,869 --> 00:31:28,579
(She took too long.)

884
00:31:28,580 --> 00:31:29,600
It's a tricky one.

885
00:31:29,840 --> 00:31:32,509
Lee Kwang Soo Game. Garlic. "Gar" or "lic".

886
00:31:32,510 --> 00:31:34,208
- 1, 2, 3. Lic. - Gar!

887
00:31:34,209 --> 00:31:35,301
That's it.

888
00:31:35,419 --> 00:31:38,307
(She said "lic" first and then shifted to "gar".)

889
00:31:38,949 --> 00:31:41,589
Lee Kwang Soo Game. Japchae. "Jap" or "chae".

890
00:31:41,590 --> 00:31:42,658
- 1, 2, 3. - Chae!

891
00:31:42,659 --> 00:31:43,688
- Jap. - Jap.

892
00:31:43,689 --> 00:31:45,089
(I won't be fooled this time.)

893
00:31:45,090 --> 00:31:46,358
(He tries the trick too.)

894
00:31:46,359 --> 00:31:47,759
(He fails.)

895
00:31:47,760 --> 00:31:50,207
- Nucksal, that's too bad. - It wasn't a bad idea.

896
00:31:50,230 --> 00:31:51,458
- Gosh. - Speed Acrostic Poem.

897
00:31:51,459 --> 00:31:52,796
(Yelping)

898
00:31:53,030 --> 00:31:54,868
(Ji Hyo ends up taking a dive.)

899
00:31:54,869 --> 00:31:56,168
(Speed Acrostic Poem: Yu Jae Seok)

900
00:31:56,169 --> 00:31:58,069
Yu Jae Seok, please...

901
00:31:58,070 --> 00:31:59,868
(Speed Acrostic Poem: Yu Jae Seok)

902
00:31:59,869 --> 00:32:01,164
Kneel in contrition.

903
00:32:02,740 --> 00:32:05,707
(Is he protesting so that he won't have to take a dive?)

904
00:32:06,109 --> 00:32:09,415
Hey, what did I do wrong to kneel in contrition?

905
00:32:09,480 --> 00:32:11,079
(He looks like the one who must apologize.)

906
00:32:11,080 --> 00:32:13,589
- That was charming of you. - I couldn't help it.

907
00:32:13,590 --> 00:32:15,966
- That was bold but friendly. - Shall we get going then?

908
00:32:16,060 --> 00:32:17,289
Seok Jin, it's our turn.

909
00:32:17,290 --> 00:32:18,489
- It's us. - Really?

910
00:32:18,490 --> 00:32:19,759
- It's our turn. - We're Apink.

911
00:32:19,760 --> 00:32:21,458
- It's our turn. - Oh, Apink.

912
00:32:21,459 --> 00:32:23,858
Seok Jin's been participating in every game so far,

913
00:32:23,859 --> 00:32:25,729
but he stays clear of the one that involves a dive.

914
00:32:25,730 --> 00:32:27,299
- He won't participate. - You're the only one...

915
00:32:27,300 --> 00:32:28,499
who's dry up here.

916
00:32:28,500 --> 00:32:30,739
- Dry and dry - Dry and dry

917
00:32:30,740 --> 00:32:34,075
(This is how Seok Jin survived on variety shows.)

918
00:32:34,469 --> 00:32:35,678
All right then.

919
00:32:35,679 --> 00:32:38,979
From our team, it'll be Na Eun and the giant.

920
00:32:38,980 --> 00:32:40,279
- Right. - All right.

921
00:32:40,280 --> 00:32:42,178
- I'll get it done. - Go on.

922
00:32:42,179 --> 00:32:44,464
- I think they'll beat the game. - It's Na Eun and the giant.

923
00:32:44,679 --> 00:32:45,944
We must win first place.

924
00:32:46,790 --> 00:32:48,519
I have a place to be, so let's go.

925
00:32:48,520 --> 00:32:50,601
- A place to be? - Let's do this!

926
00:32:50,689 --> 00:32:51,789
He has a place to be.

927
00:32:51,790 --> 00:32:53,462
- A place to be? - Yes.

928
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:54,983
Here we go then.

929
00:32:55,659 --> 00:32:57,928
Ready, go.

930
00:32:57,929 --> 00:32:59,868
Say It Backwards. Espana.

931
00:32:59,869 --> 00:33:02,938
(Say It Backwards: Espana)

932
00:33:02,939 --> 00:33:04,569
"Nas"...

933
00:33:04,570 --> 00:33:07,009
How can Kwang Soo get this right?

934
00:33:07,010 --> 00:33:08,579
Speed Acrostic Poem with Lee Kwang Soo.

935
00:33:08,580 --> 00:33:10,408
Lee Kwang Soo...

936
00:33:10,409 --> 00:33:13,079
is a manic swimmer.

937
00:33:13,080 --> 00:33:14,201
Nice!

938
00:33:14,679 --> 00:33:17,474
(She made a perfect sentence.)

939
00:33:17,580 --> 00:33:19,559
Speed Acrostic Poem with Son Na Eun.

940
00:33:19,750 --> 00:33:22,019
Son Na Eun is the nation's...

(Kwang Soo, hurry!)

942
00:33:24,260 --> 00:33:25,259
Tinfoil.

943
00:33:25,260 --> 00:33:26,280
(Son Na Eun is the nation's tinfoil?)

944
00:33:26,629 --> 00:33:28,658
(Son Na Eun, the nation's tinfoil)

945
00:33:28,659 --> 00:33:31,209
- What is he saying? - My gosh!

946
00:33:31,800 --> 00:33:34,044
(She ends up falling in anyways.)

947
00:33:34,570 --> 00:33:36,269
My gosh.

948
00:33:36,270 --> 00:33:38,198

Say It Backwards. Spain.

950
00:33:41,040 --> 00:33:43,779
"N"... "Niaps".

951
00:33:43,780 --> 00:33:45,891
I can't believe him.

952
00:33:47,510 --> 00:33:49,178
He's good for nothing, isn't he?

953
00:33:49,179 --> 00:33:51,378
What do you mean she's the nation's tinfoil?

954
00:33:51,379 --> 00:33:52,589
Gosh.

955
00:33:52,590 --> 00:33:54,630
Are you that bad at improvisations?

956
00:33:55,260 --> 00:33:56,789
Goodness.

957
00:33:56,790 --> 00:33:59,686
Next up is Corporation SORAN.

958
00:33:59,929 --> 00:34:01,388
Two of them!

959
00:34:01,389 --> 00:34:02,684
(Two from Corporation SORAN!)

960
00:34:03,260 --> 00:34:04,259
(You heard their names a few minutes ago.)

961
00:34:04,260 --> 00:34:06,868
- Two of them! - What are their names?

962
00:34:06,869 --> 00:34:08,028
Call them by their names.

963
00:34:08,029 --> 00:34:09,669
- Go. - Seo Myun Ho and Lee Tae Wook.

964
00:34:09,670 --> 00:34:11,499
- Myun Ho and Tae Wook. - "Myun Heo", cue!

965
00:34:11,500 --> 00:34:13,769
It's Myun Ho, not Myun Heo.

966
00:34:13,770 --> 00:34:15,922
- And Tae Wook. - Myun Ho and Tae Wook.

967
00:34:16,380 --> 00:34:18,725
They look like two robots up there.

968
00:34:18,779 --> 00:34:20,579
They are robots that play games.

969
00:34:20,580 --> 00:34:21,678
The machines...

970
00:34:21,679 --> 00:34:23,079
that do everything by the book.

971
00:34:23,080 --> 00:34:25,079
- All right! - I have a good feeling about this.

972
00:34:25,080 --> 00:34:27,639
I only accept loud voices from my employees.

973
00:34:27,690 --> 00:34:28,888
- Yes, sir! - Got it!

974
00:34:28,889 --> 00:34:30,216
It doesn't matter if we lose.

975
00:34:30,790 --> 00:34:32,085
Lose with dignity!

976
00:34:32,360 --> 00:34:33,890
The company's so old-fashioned.

977
00:34:34,029 --> 00:34:35,897
Okay, here we go.

978
00:34:36,500 --> 00:34:38,829
- Good luck. - Ready, go.

00:34:38,830 --> 00:34:40,838

00:34:41,130 --> 00:34:43,499

982
00:34:46,239 --> 00:34:47,238
Hurry!

983
00:34:47,239 --> 00:34:48,291
Hey!

984
00:34:48,980 --> 00:34:50,079
I can tell that he's nervous.

985
00:34:50,080 --> 00:34:51,946
Color Game. Blue, blue, green.

986
00:34:52,750 --> 00:34:54,048
(It's your turn.)

987
00:34:54,049 --> 00:34:55,209
Hurry.

988
00:34:55,210 --> 00:34:58,948
(Color Game: Blue, blue, green)

989
00:34:58,949 --> 00:35:00,244
What are you doing?

990
00:35:01,190 --> 00:35:03,118
(An error has occurred with Robot Number 2.)

991
00:35:03,119 --> 00:35:04,158
What's going on?

992
00:35:04,159 --> 00:35:05,559
Lee Kwang Soo Game.

993
00:35:05,560 --> 00:35:07,388
Sky. "Sk" or "Y". 1, 2, 3.

994
00:35:07,389 --> 00:35:08,388
- Y. - Y.

995
00:35:08,389 --> 00:35:09,420
(Incorrect!)

996
00:35:10,759 --> 00:35:12,669
(Corporation SORAN is close to bankruptcy.)

997
00:35:12,670 --> 00:35:15,269
Oh, no. I really thought they'd make it.

998
00:35:15,270 --> 00:35:16,269
It was adorable.

999
00:35:16,270 --> 00:35:17,468
(The game's too tricky for variety show rookies.)

1000
00:35:17,469 --> 00:35:19,568
I honestly can't tell those two apart.

1001
00:35:19,569 --> 00:35:21,508
They seem like twins.

1002
00:35:21,509 --> 00:35:23,309
- I... - Twins?

1003
00:35:23,310 --> 00:35:24,479
Don't you agree?

1004
00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:26,048
Which one is which?

1005
00:35:26,049 --> 00:35:29,180
Tae Wook and Myun Ho are true amateurs.

1006
00:35:29,480 --> 00:35:31,254
- Amateurs? - True amateurs.

1007
00:35:31,650 --> 00:35:32,888
- Right. - Of course.

1008
00:35:32,889 --> 00:35:35,092
Say whatever you want, but those two are amateurs.

1009
00:35:35,150 --> 00:35:37,434
I haven't seen amateurs like those two before.

1010
00:35:37,860 --> 00:35:40,459
Next time get ready. We'll only do three games this time.

1011
00:35:40,460 --> 00:35:42,295
- Sure. - Three games?

1012
00:35:42,500 --> 00:35:44,499
Ready, go.

1013
00:35:44,500 --> 00:35:46,916
Say It Backwards. Ukraine.

1014
00:35:47,770 --> 00:35:50,320
"Nei... Ark..."

1015
00:35:51,069 --> 00:35:52,262
Lee Kwang Soo Game.

1016
00:35:52,639 --> 00:35:55,008
Choose between "Jjam" and "bbong". 1, 2, 3.

1017
00:35:55,009 --> 00:35:56,238
- Jjam! - Jjam!

1018
00:35:56,239 --> 00:35:57,566
(He failed again.)

1019
00:35:57,639 --> 00:35:58,731
Goodness.

1020
00:35:59,049 --> 00:36:00,349
Doesn't it look like it got faster?

1021
00:36:00,350 --> 00:36:01,573
It's getting faster.

1022
00:36:01,850 --> 00:36:02,979
(In return for just three wins to succeed, the belt is moving faster.)

1023
00:36:02,980 --> 00:36:04,478
- It's faster. - Why is it going so fast?

1024
00:36:04,920 --> 00:36:06,649
What was that? Turn it back again.

1025
00:36:06,650 --> 00:36:08,118
- No way! - Turn it back.

1026
00:36:08,119 --> 00:36:09,218
Move.

1027
00:36:09,219 --> 00:36:11,519
(We'll move if you don't.)

1028
00:36:11,520 --> 00:36:13,129
(This is how the pros do it.)

1029
00:36:13,130 --> 00:36:15,629
- That's too much. - That's enough.

1030
00:36:15,630 --> 00:36:17,057
(Giving a self-advantage without even consulting the staff)

1031
00:36:17,330 --> 00:36:19,568
(How far back are you going?)

1032
00:36:19,569 --> 00:36:20,928
Lee Kwang Soo Game.

1033
00:36:20,929 --> 00:36:22,638
Mathematics. Say "Math" or "matics".

1034
00:36:22,639 --> 00:36:23,738
1, 2, 3.

1035
00:36:23,739 --> 00:36:24,968
- Math. - Math. What was that?

1036
00:36:24,969 --> 00:36:26,368
Why do you keep saying the first syllable only?

1037
00:36:26,369 --> 00:36:28,638
(Why do you keep saying the first syllable only?)

1038
00:36:28,639 --> 00:36:30,439
(Yelling at junior producers)

1039
00:36:30,440 --> 00:36:32,448
- What did the producer do wrong? - Say It Backwards.

1040
00:36:32,449 --> 00:36:33,530
Live to look good.

1041
00:36:34,380 --> 00:36:35,675
"Good look..."

1042
00:36:35,920 --> 00:36:37,379
"to live." This is too fast.

1043
00:36:37,380 --> 00:36:38,879
- It's too fast. - Why is it going so fast?

1044
00:36:38,949 --> 00:36:40,215
Why is it so fast?

1045
00:36:40,790 --> 00:36:42,656
Is this a highway or what?

1046
00:36:42,920 --> 00:36:45,030
- Is this a freeway or something? - Why is it going so fast?

1047
00:36:45,290 --> 00:36:46,488
(He's using his strength to hold onto the belt.)

1048
00:36:46,489 --> 00:36:47,509
It's working.

1049
00:36:48,799 --> 00:36:50,459
(It stopped. We're good.)

1050
00:36:50,460 --> 00:36:53,153
(This team gets through everything by using force.)

1051
00:36:54,600 --> 00:36:55,798
Say It Backwards.

1052
00:36:55,799 --> 00:36:56,860
"Anne of Green Gables".

1053
00:36:57,239 --> 00:36:58,423
You think I can do that?

1054
00:36:59,170 --> 00:37:02,008
(He was going to get it wrong, but he at least dove in nicely.)

1055
00:37:02,009 --> 00:37:03,178
Poor guys.

1056
00:37:03,179 --> 00:37:04,536
Look at him.

1057
00:37:04,839 --> 00:37:06,237
He's giving up again.

1058
00:37:06,549 --> 00:37:07,804
This is too hard.

1059
00:37:08,850 --> 00:37:11,266
- Let's go. - We have to do good.

1060
00:37:11,779 --> 00:37:12,972
Good luck Eun Ji!

1061
00:37:13,420 --> 00:37:15,806
- Here comes the king of improv. - It's the king of improv.

1062
00:37:15,989 --> 00:37:17,244
The emperor of improv.

1063
00:37:17,290 --> 00:37:19,371
- Just watch. - He's incredible.

1064
00:37:19,630 --> 00:37:21,190
Watch how good he is at Say It Backwards.

1065
00:37:21,330 --> 00:37:24,298
- He beats the game itself. - He's like a rapper.

1066
00:37:24,299 --> 00:37:26,920
You know how hip-hop artists play with the beat?

1067
00:37:27,130 --> 00:37:28,428
I do that with words.

1068
00:37:28,429 --> 00:37:30,099
(I play with words like hip-hop artists play with the beat.)

1069
00:37:30,100 --> 00:37:32,252
He's also a master in Say It Backwards.

1070
00:37:32,270 --> 00:37:34,138
- I'm serious. - Watch how I improvise.

1071
00:37:34,139 --> 00:37:36,046
He even says things backwards in his sleep.

1072
00:37:36,310 --> 00:37:38,309
(Mythical stories about Jae Seok are spilling out from everywhere.)

1073
00:37:38,310 --> 00:37:40,216
- We'll get started now. - Let's go.

1074
00:37:40,509 --> 00:37:42,212
Start.

1075
00:37:42,449 --> 00:37:44,388
Say It Backwards. Highlighter pen.

1076
00:37:44,719 --> 00:37:46,179
- "Pen highlighter". - Good.

1077
00:37:46,219 --> 00:37:47,546
Speed Acrostic Poem.

1078
00:37:47,949 --> 00:37:50,289
(It's finally the emperor's turn.)

1079
00:37:50,290 --> 00:37:52,359
(It's time for him to show his unbelievable wit...)

1080
00:37:52,360 --> 00:37:54,297
(to all the inexperienced rookies.)

1081
00:37:54,330 --> 00:37:55,599
Speed Acrostic Poem.

1082
00:37:55,600 --> 00:37:56,798
- Jee Seok Jin. - Jee Seok Jin.

1083
00:37:56,799 --> 00:37:58,054
Jee Seok Jin.

1084
00:37:58,100 --> 00:38:00,171
Seok Jin.

1085
00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:03,039
(Jee Seok Jin, Jee Seok Jin, Seok Jin.)

1086
00:38:03,040 --> 00:38:04,498
What was that?

1087
00:38:05,869 --> 00:38:07,609
What was that?

1088
00:38:07,610 --> 00:38:09,109
(It's too embarrassing to show our guests.)

1089
00:38:09,110 --> 00:38:10,945
Who are you trying to imitate?

1090
00:38:10,980 --> 00:38:13,048
Lee Kwang Soo Game. Meat pancakes. "Meat" or "pancakes".

1091
00:38:13,049 --> 00:38:14,611
- 1, 2, 3. Meat! - Pancakes!

1092
00:38:14,650 --> 00:38:15,919
- You got it. - Lee Kwang Soo Game.

1093
00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:18,379
Jjajang. "Jja" or "jang". 1, 2, 3.

1094
00:38:18,380 --> 00:38:19,572
- Jja. - Jja.

1095
00:38:19,850 --> 00:38:21,930
(The emperor fails again.)

1096
00:38:22,619 --> 00:38:24,419
Speed Acrostic Poem. Lee Kwang Soo.

1097
00:38:24,420 --> 00:38:25,440
(Trying to hold on)

1098
00:38:26,360 --> 00:38:29,624
Lee Kwang Soo, Kwang Soo...

1099
00:38:30,960 --> 00:38:32,028
Kwang Soo...

1100
00:38:32,029 --> 00:38:33,028
is trash.

1101
00:38:33,029 --> 00:38:34,764
(Kwang Soo is trash.)

1102
00:38:35,429 --> 00:38:36,899
(Kwang Soo is trash!)

1103
00:38:36,900 --> 00:38:38,225
She called him trash.

1104
00:38:38,540 --> 00:38:40,138
(She left some wise words...)

1105
00:38:40,139 --> 00:38:41,738
That was good.

1106
00:38:41,739 --> 00:38:43,167
Why is that a fail?

1107
00:38:43,239 --> 00:38:44,566
Speed Acrostic Poem. Lee Kwang Soo.

1108
00:38:44,610 --> 00:38:46,508
- We need to go again. - Speed Poem. Lee Kwang Soo.

1109
00:38:46,509 --> 00:38:47,778
- Who? - Lee Kwang Soo.

1110
00:38:47,779 --> 00:38:48,979
Lee Kwang Soo.

1111
00:38:48,980 --> 00:38:50,754
(Kwang Soo you brat!)

1112
00:38:52,819 --> 00:38:55,519
(He barely said anything but Kwang Soo feels insulted already.)

1113
00:38:55,520 --> 00:38:57,689
(What was that?)

1114
00:38:57,690 --> 00:39:00,310
(Jae Seok looked like such an amateur at this game.)

1115
00:39:00,330 --> 00:39:01,656
I called him trash.

1116
00:39:01,790 --> 00:39:02,952
Trash!

1117
00:39:04,259 --> 00:39:05,568
(We had no idea it could get worse than "manic swimmer".)

1118
00:39:05,569 --> 00:39:06,899
- Trash. - Trash.

1119
00:39:06,900 --> 00:39:08,968
- Kwang Soo the trash. - Kwang Soo the trash.

1120
00:39:08,969 --> 00:39:10,368
(Team Apink's third round is over just like that.)

1121
00:39:10,369 --> 00:39:13,039
- Let's go. - They understand the game now.

1122
00:39:13,040 --> 00:39:15,355
Ready, set, go.

1123
00:39:15,639 --> 00:39:17,546
Speed Acrostic Poem. Jee Seok Jin.

1124
00:39:18,679 --> 00:39:19,771
Ji Sang Yeol,

1125
00:39:19,880 --> 00:39:22,399
Seok Jin isn't nearly as funny as you are.

1126
00:39:22,449 --> 00:39:23,674
That's good.

1127
00:39:24,250 --> 00:39:25,749
Lee Kwang Soo Game. Seoul.

1128
00:39:25,750 --> 00:39:27,419
"Seo" or "ul". 1, 2, 3.

1129
00:39:27,420 --> 00:39:28,548
- Seo. - Ul.

1130
00:39:28,549 --> 00:39:30,118
- He's good. - They're good.

1131
00:39:30,119 --> 00:39:31,211
Just one more to go.

1132
00:39:31,589 --> 00:39:33,089
Speed Acrostic Poem. Kim Jong Kook.

1133
00:39:33,730 --> 00:39:36,178
(They'll be in the lead if he successfully makes up the poem.)

1134
00:39:36,560 --> 00:39:38,466
(Show us, Nucksal.)

1135
00:39:38,600 --> 00:39:39,698
Kim Jong Kook.

1136
00:39:39,699 --> 00:39:42,932
Kim Jong Kook...

1137
00:39:43,170 --> 00:39:44,868
does not drink soup from a saucer.

1138
00:39:44,869 --> 00:39:47,539
(Kim Jong Kook does not drink soup from a saucer.)

1139
00:39:47,540 --> 00:39:48,693
That was good.

1140
00:39:49,210 --> 00:39:51,138
(I didn't expect us to succeed!)

1141
00:39:51,139 --> 00:39:52,209
No way.

1142
00:39:52,210 --> 00:39:54,525
We did it!

1143
00:39:55,619 --> 00:39:56,649
No way.

1144
00:39:56,650 --> 00:39:58,965
(They succeeded just in three games, placing first.)

1145
00:39:59,420 --> 00:40:00,980
I finally met a good team.

1146
00:40:01,290 --> 00:40:02,953
They're so good.

1147
00:40:03,259 --> 00:40:04,859
(Code Kunst is all excited now.)

1148
00:40:04,860 --> 00:40:06,859
- They're so energetic. - They're full of energy.

1149
00:40:06,860 --> 00:40:08,522
They're loud kids like us.

1150
00:40:08,589 --> 00:40:10,499
- Good job! - Awesome!

1151
00:40:10,500 --> 00:40:12,265
(They can exchange a member and reject an order to exchange.)

1152
00:40:12,770 --> 00:40:15,147
Say It Backwards. Fight a hundred battles and win a hundred times.

1153
00:40:15,799 --> 00:40:17,024
Times hundred a win and battles hundred a fight.

1154
00:40:17,069 --> 00:40:18,669
"Trea" or "sure". 1, 2, 3.

1155
00:40:18,670 --> 00:40:19,908
- Trea. - Sure.

1156
00:40:19,909 --> 00:40:21,109
- Just one more to go. - Just one more.

1157
00:40:21,110 --> 00:40:22,838
Speed Acrostic Poem.

1158
00:40:22,839 --> 00:40:24,109
Jeon So Min.

1159
00:40:24,110 --> 00:40:26,455
The mighty So Min...

1160
00:40:27,350 --> 00:40:29,013
- is embarrassed. - That's right.

1161
00:40:29,319 --> 00:40:32,309
(It makes sense though it sounds weird, so they get a point.)

1162
00:40:32,389 --> 00:40:33,388
(Team SORAN is guaranteed second place.)

1163
00:40:33,389 --> 00:40:34,572
- That was good. - Okay.

1164
00:40:34,750 --> 00:40:36,045
So...

1165
00:40:36,560 --> 00:40:39,258
Team Nucksal and Code Kunst placed first.

1166
00:40:39,259 --> 00:40:40,629
We're in the lead.

1167
00:40:40,630 --> 00:40:41,959
Team SORAN is in second place.

1168
00:40:41,960 --> 00:40:44,203
(What will the first and the second place teams decide to do?)

1169
00:40:44,860 --> 00:40:47,399
Team Nucksal and Code Kunst, please come up first.

1170
00:40:47,400 --> 00:40:49,638
(There's no change if all teammates choose the same card.)

1171
00:40:49,639 --> 00:40:50,822
Are you all ready?

1172
00:40:51,239 --> 00:40:52,392
One.

1173
00:40:53,239 --> 00:40:54,408
Two.

1174
00:40:54,409 --> 00:40:56,109
(If they choose different cards, whoever chooses the wrong card...)

1175
00:40:56,110 --> 00:40:57,778
(receives the team member exchange card.)

1176
00:40:57,779 --> 00:40:58,908
Three.

1177
00:40:58,909 --> 00:41:01,479
(What did Team Nucksal and Code Kunst choose?)

1178
00:41:01,480 --> 00:41:04,048
(They all chose the same card.)

1179
00:41:04,049 --> 00:41:05,682
This team is set.

1180
00:41:05,989 --> 00:41:07,448
Get in here!

1181
00:41:07,449 --> 00:41:08,888
(Nobody can take anyone from this team anymore.)

1182
00:41:08,889 --> 00:41:10,919
Nobody can change this team now.

1183
00:41:10,920 --> 00:41:11,988
Team SORAN.

1184
00:41:11,989 --> 00:41:13,081
What should we do?

1185
00:41:13,860 --> 00:41:15,084
Let's all choose "Change Both".

1186
00:41:15,089 --> 00:41:16,428
Then we'll stay as we are.

1187
00:41:16,429 --> 00:41:17,528
(They've decided to choose the same card and stay together.)

1188
00:41:17,529 --> 00:41:18,758
- We're all staying, right? - Yes.

1189
00:41:18,759 --> 00:41:19,790
You like this team, right?

1190
00:41:19,929 --> 00:41:21,868
- You like us, right? - Of course, I do.

1191
00:41:21,869 --> 00:41:23,063
I love this team.

1192
00:41:23,139 --> 00:41:24,499
- Are you done discussing? - Yes.

1193
00:41:24,500 --> 00:41:25,561
Yes.

1194
00:41:25,639 --> 00:41:26,709
One.

1195
00:41:26,710 --> 00:41:28,039
(What will this team choose?)

1196
00:41:28,040 --> 00:41:29,060
Two.

1197
00:41:29,940 --> 00:41:32,387
- Three. - Here!

1198
00:41:33,310 --> 00:41:35,818
(Seok Jin and Young Bae chose the same card.)

1199
00:41:35,819 --> 00:41:37,789
(But wait.)

1200
00:41:38,449 --> 00:41:39,548
Changing one.

1201
00:41:39,549 --> 00:41:40,749
(So Min chose the member-changing card alone.)

1202
00:41:40,750 --> 00:41:42,048
- I didn't know that I chose this. - Seriously?

1203
00:41:42,049 --> 00:41:43,289
I really had no idea.

1204
00:41:43,290 --> 00:41:44,686
I seriously just picked the wrong card.

1205
00:41:44,759 --> 00:41:46,158
I really didn't know that it was this card.

1206
00:41:46,159 --> 00:41:47,829
I had no idea.

1207
00:41:47,830 --> 00:41:49,428
- I really didn't know. - No way.

1208
00:41:49,429 --> 00:41:50,551
So Min.

1209
00:41:51,130 --> 00:41:52,999
- I had no idea. - She planned this.

1210
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:54,669
- She knew all along. - I really didn't know.

1211
00:41:54,670 --> 00:41:56,439
- This was her plan. - I had no idea.

1212
00:41:56,440 --> 00:41:58,838
(I honestly had no idea.)

1213
00:41:58,839 --> 00:42:00,502
(Kneels down)

1214
00:42:01,009 --> 00:42:02,539
Are you insane?

1215
00:42:02,540 --> 00:42:03,678
Are you insane?

1216
00:42:03,679 --> 00:42:05,539
(After a long discussion, the Oldie CEO has decided to move.)

1217
00:42:05,540 --> 00:42:07,519
So Min, who do you want to bring to your team?

1218
00:42:07,810 --> 00:42:08,948
- We... - I can't believe this.

1219
00:42:08,949 --> 00:42:10,278
made our decision...

1220
00:42:10,279 --> 00:42:11,979
- after our long discussion. - Please.

1221
00:42:11,980 --> 00:42:13,318
We voted on this.

1222
00:42:13,319 --> 00:42:15,187
(Which team will Seok Jin end up in?)

1223
00:42:15,219 --> 00:42:17,658
(Will it be Team Gummy...)

1224
00:42:17,659 --> 00:42:20,988
(or Team Apink?)

1225
00:42:20,989 --> 00:42:24,229
(Seok Jin for...)

1226
00:42:24,230 --> 00:42:26,028
Jae Seok.

1227
00:42:26,029 --> 00:42:27,468
(for Jae Seok.)

1228
00:42:27,469 --> 00:42:29,269
(You're trading with our team?)

1229
00:42:29,270 --> 00:42:31,698
No, please don't.

1230
00:42:31,699 --> 00:42:35,368
(Team Gummy is staying as they are.)

1231
00:42:35,369 --> 00:42:36,461
Wow.

1232
00:42:36,580 --> 00:42:38,479
I didn't know that it was going to end up like this.

1233
00:42:38,480 --> 00:42:40,609
- We were the best team. - Now,

1234
00:42:40,610 --> 00:42:42,691
I present to you, the new CEO of Team SORAN.

1235
00:42:44,319 --> 00:42:46,048
You're here.

1236
00:42:46,049 --> 00:42:47,416
(Welcome, CEO Yu.)

1237
00:42:47,690 --> 00:42:49,318
Let's just be funny.

1238
00:42:49,319 --> 00:42:51,658
(Let's just be funny.)

1239
00:42:51,659 --> 00:42:52,829
(They've decided to be the funny team.)

1240
00:42:52,830 --> 00:42:54,053
Let's just be funny.

1241
00:42:54,529 --> 00:42:57,198
Hey, I released an album before.

1242
00:42:57,199 --> 00:42:59,311
Cho Rong, this is so sad.

1243
00:42:59,369 --> 00:43:00,625
Let's switch our uniforms now.

1244
00:43:01,100 --> 00:43:02,568
I can't even count how many times I've changed my uniforms.

1245
00:43:02,569 --> 00:43:04,579
(I've had to change too many times.)

1246
00:43:05,239 --> 00:43:07,554
- How many times have you changed? - You changed so many times.

1247
00:43:08,110 --> 00:43:10,047
It's amazing, really.

1248
00:43:10,339 --> 00:43:11,869
You're the biggest catch.

1249
00:43:12,179 --> 00:43:14,048
(Moving from one team to another is my forte.)

1250
00:43:14,049 --> 00:43:16,467
I'll try my best.

1251
00:43:16,819 --> 00:43:18,074
Great.

1252
00:43:18,679 --> 00:43:19,873
I'll try my best.

1253
00:43:20,350 --> 00:43:21,618
Team SORAN.

1254
00:43:21,619 --> 00:43:23,497
- Nice to meet you. - There's a frog here.

1255
00:43:23,719 --> 00:43:25,459
The frog and the grasshopper meet again.

1256
00:43:25,460 --> 00:43:26,612
(After the many exchanges, the teams are finally set.)

1257
00:43:27,029 --> 00:43:29,829
(A week later)

1258
00:43:29,830 --> 00:43:32,698
- Hello. - It's just as So Min described.

1259
00:43:32,699 --> 00:43:34,269
I told him that there were a lot of animals here.

1260
00:43:34,270 --> 00:43:35,468
This is Corporation SORAN.

1261
00:43:35,469 --> 00:43:36,999
(This is SORAN's place.)

1262
00:43:37,600 --> 00:43:40,057
- This is our first meeting. - Yes.

1263
00:43:40,670 --> 00:43:42,678
You all look good today.

1264
00:43:42,679 --> 00:43:44,039
(You all look good today.)

1265
00:43:44,040 --> 00:43:45,439
(They definitely tried harder to dress better this time.)

1266
00:43:45,440 --> 00:43:47,048
You're right. He even took his hat off.

1267
00:43:47,049 --> 00:43:48,379
I see...

1268
00:43:48,380 --> 00:43:50,766
a couple of awkward things here and there.

1269
00:43:51,179 --> 00:43:54,485
The awkward feeling in new clothes.

1270
00:43:54,790 --> 00:43:57,268
Look at your socks.

1271
00:43:57,889 --> 00:44:00,528
Did you match your socks with your guitar?

1272
00:44:00,529 --> 00:44:02,018
You're right.

1273
00:44:02,159 --> 00:44:03,629
I didn't know I'd be wearing these.

1274
00:44:03,699 --> 00:44:06,129
You really tried hard to look good today.

1275
00:44:06,130 --> 00:44:07,329
- Yes. - Anyway,

1276
00:44:07,330 --> 00:44:10,198
we ended the show off on a really bright note,

1277
00:44:10,199 --> 00:44:11,638
so I just didn't say anything,

1278
00:44:11,639 --> 00:44:12,868
but why did you have to get me on this team?

1279
00:44:12,869 --> 00:44:15,521
(Why did you have to get me on this team?)

1280
00:44:15,569 --> 00:44:16,939
Why did you do that?

1281
00:44:16,940 --> 00:44:18,714
(Why did you do that?)

1282
00:44:18,909 --> 00:44:22,622
I was going to be in a team with Apink.

1283
00:44:22,850 --> 00:44:25,125
I didn't complain then because I was busy laughing at Seok Jin.

1284
00:44:25,420 --> 00:44:26,847
I watched him go.

1285
00:44:27,589 --> 00:44:29,459
We really couldn't be on a team with Seok Jin.

1286
00:44:29,460 --> 00:44:31,388
(We really couldn't be on a team with Seok Jin.)

1287
00:44:31,389 --> 00:44:34,959
(We couldn't deal with that old-fashioned CEO.)

1288
00:44:34,960 --> 00:44:36,028
- Why? - We had a lot of clashes.

1289
00:44:36,029 --> 00:44:37,229
Why did you take me away from Apink?

1290
00:44:37,230 --> 00:44:39,129
- Do you know "Fake Love" by BTS? - Of course, I do.

1291
00:44:39,130 --> 00:44:40,322
Tae Wook played the guitar for that.

1292
00:44:40,869 --> 00:44:42,257
- Are you serious? - Yes.

1293
00:44:42,699 --> 00:44:45,399
Why didn't you tell me so earlier?

1294
00:44:45,400 --> 00:44:48,296
(Why didn't you tell me so earlier?)

1295
00:44:48,909 --> 00:44:50,031
Why didn't you?

1296
00:44:50,110 --> 00:44:51,539
You should've told me earlier.

1297
00:44:51,540 --> 00:44:54,029
This is exactly the type of things you need to tell me.

1298
00:44:54,810 --> 00:44:55,919
I told you.

1299
00:44:55,920 --> 00:44:57,448
- I'm sorry, but... - This is...

1300
00:44:57,449 --> 00:44:59,419
this is the key to my heart.

1301
00:44:59,420 --> 00:45:01,153
I'm disappointed in you.

1302
00:45:02,020 --> 00:45:03,794
Can you play a bit of "Fake Love" for me?

1303
00:45:04,389 --> 00:45:06,129
When I was recording the song,

1304
00:45:06,130 --> 00:45:07,829
I made the part so that it can't be played by just one person.

1305
00:45:07,830 --> 00:45:10,858
It's such a difficult part that he can't play it live.

1306
00:45:10,900 --> 00:45:11,999
The live version is played by someone else.

1307
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:13,698
(What does that mean?)

1308
00:45:13,699 --> 00:45:15,198
- Really? - So what is it?

1309
00:45:15,199 --> 00:45:17,036
You made the part, but can't play it live?

1310
00:45:17,469 --> 00:45:19,669
I've never played it live.

1311
00:45:19,670 --> 00:45:20,868
What about the recent song?

1312
00:45:20,869 --> 00:45:22,609
- That one... - What about "Boy With Luv"?

1313
00:45:22,610 --> 00:45:24,778
- That one... - Did you also play "Boy With Luv"?

1314
00:45:24,779 --> 00:45:26,177
Yes.

1315
00:45:26,549 --> 00:45:27,702
Can you play it now?

1316
00:45:27,779 --> 00:45:28,908
I can't remember how it goes.

1317
00:45:28,909 --> 00:45:32,079
(I can't remember how it goes.)

1318
00:45:32,080 --> 00:45:33,249
(What do you mean, you can't remember?)

1319
00:45:33,250 --> 00:45:34,443
What are you doing?

1320
00:45:35,589 --> 00:45:37,017
What are you trying to do?

1321
00:45:37,219 --> 00:45:38,758
You can't play "Fake Love"...

1322
00:45:38,759 --> 00:45:40,831
or "Boy With Luv" for us?

1323
00:45:41,360 --> 00:45:44,329
(Sorry, Tae Wook is a bit off because he's genius.)

1324
00:45:44,330 --> 00:45:45,499
Seriously.

1325
00:45:45,500 --> 00:45:47,269
Something sounds fishy.

1326
00:45:47,270 --> 00:45:48,554
You can't play at all?

1327
00:45:49,369 --> 00:45:50,638
Fine.

1328
00:45:50,639 --> 00:45:52,499
For now, let's hear...

1329
00:45:52,500 --> 00:45:56,338
a nice song you prepared.

1330
00:45:56,339 --> 00:45:58,859
There is a pretty cheerful song,

1331
00:45:59,009 --> 00:46:01,427
a medium-tempo ballad song that would have strong music sales,

1332
00:46:01,750 --> 00:46:04,433
and a totally cheerful song. There are three songs.

1333
00:46:04,719 --> 00:46:07,034
- You prepared different songs. - We prepared the outlines.

1334
00:46:07,719 --> 00:46:09,718
You should listen to them.

1335
00:46:09,719 --> 00:46:11,088
- Shall we do that? - Yes.

1336
00:46:11,089 --> 00:46:12,519
- A pretty cheerful song. - A pretty cheerful song.

1337
00:46:12,520 --> 00:46:14,059
It won't be half-bad for a performance.

1338
00:46:14,060 --> 00:46:15,926
- That's good. - We will play that first.

1339
00:46:16,500 --> 00:46:18,601
- A pretty cheerful song. - A pretty cheerful song.

1340
00:46:20,529 --> 00:46:24,272
(Playing the melody)

1341
00:46:25,270 --> 00:46:28,968
(He rides the rhythm and gets ready to show good cheer.)

1342
00:46:28,969 --> 00:46:30,774
(It feels good.)

1343
00:46:31,909 --> 00:46:33,746
(They are good.)

1344
00:46:35,949 --> 00:46:39,689
(Their hands and feet move to the rhythm.)

1345
00:46:39,690 --> 00:46:42,240
(They have the perfect teamwork.)

1346
00:46:43,989 --> 00:46:45,059
(The first song...)

1347
00:46:45,060 --> 00:46:48,229
(uplifts their mood with the varied beats and sweet melody.)

1348
00:46:48,230 --> 00:46:49,559
- That's how it goes. - It's really nice.

1349
00:46:49,560 --> 00:46:50,829
- That's the song. - It's really nice.

1350
00:46:50,830 --> 00:46:52,928
It's a bit like pop music.

1351
00:46:52,929 --> 00:46:54,129
- You are correct. - Right?

1352
00:46:54,130 --> 00:46:55,729
- It's like pop music. - It's like pop music.

1353
00:46:55,730 --> 00:46:58,568
It wouldn't be strange if it goes on the Billboard charts.

1354
00:46:58,569 --> 00:47:01,138
(He tries to sell the song.)

1355
00:47:01,139 --> 00:47:02,209
(The Billboard charts?)

1356
00:47:02,210 --> 00:47:03,230
That's right.

1357
00:47:04,310 --> 00:47:06,391
Your ambition exceeds your popularity.

1358
00:47:07,880 --> 00:47:10,979
(His ambition is big enough for the Billboard.)

1359
00:47:10,980 --> 00:47:12,478
(They can't deny it.)

1360
00:47:12,850 --> 00:47:14,289
Your ambition...

1361
00:47:14,290 --> 00:47:16,088
- I get that a lot. - Seriously.

1362
00:47:16,089 --> 00:47:18,262
I have always taken good care of my image...

1363
00:47:18,560 --> 00:47:20,528
in case I become a star.

1364
00:47:20,790 --> 00:47:24,428
I see that Yu Il can play the drums better than I expected.

1365
00:47:24,429 --> 00:47:25,528
- Thank you. - He is cool.

1366
00:47:25,529 --> 00:47:26,798
- You didn't expect that. - I thought...

1367
00:47:26,799 --> 00:47:30,238
the band was built on friendship.

1368
00:47:30,239 --> 00:47:33,638
(He thought SORAN was built on friendship.)

1369
00:47:33,639 --> 00:47:36,332
I had never witnessed your talent.

1370
00:47:36,679 --> 00:47:38,879
I now see that everyone is quite talented.

1371
00:47:38,880 --> 00:47:41,008
What's the song that will top digital music charts?

1372
00:47:41,009 --> 00:47:42,109
- That's... - The medium-tempo song.

1373
00:47:42,110 --> 00:47:43,249
Are you sure of it?

1374
00:47:43,250 --> 00:47:44,419
- It will be a mega-hit. - Really?

1375
00:47:44,420 --> 00:47:45,675
You won't be able to walk down the street.

1376
00:47:46,049 --> 00:47:47,349
- Is it that good? - If we pick this song,

1377
00:47:47,350 --> 00:47:48,746
we will need to form a group.

1378
00:47:48,949 --> 00:47:50,758
I am a bit afraid of that.

1379
00:47:50,759 --> 00:47:53,088
Has SORAN ever topped digital music charts?

1380
00:47:53,089 --> 00:47:54,282
We will do that with this song.

1381
00:47:55,190 --> 00:47:56,863
- This is the beginning. - That's right.

1382
00:47:57,230 --> 00:47:58,758
- We will top the charts. - This is the beginning.

1383
00:47:58,759 --> 00:47:59,769
That's right.

1384
00:47:59,770 --> 00:48:01,840
You will take the first step with us.

1385
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:03,396
The newborn on digital music charts.

1386
00:48:03,799 --> 00:48:06,408
Let's hear the song that will top...

1387
00:48:06,409 --> 00:48:07,609
- digital music charts. - All right.

1388
00:48:07,610 --> 00:48:08,732
We will play it.

1389
00:48:08,856 --> 00:48:13,056
<font color="#fcc89b">[VIU Ver] SBS E459 Running Man</font>

<font color="#ff5fa2">-♥ Ruo Xi ♥-</font>

1390
00:48:13,179 --> 00:48:15,508
(The mood is quite different from that of the first song.)

1391
00:48:15,509 --> 00:48:16,718
I am in tears already.

1392
00:48:16,719 --> 00:48:17,919
(He scoffs.)

1393
00:48:17,920 --> 00:48:19,649
- Are you in tears? - Yes.

1394
00:48:19,650 --> 00:48:23,536
(It's a melody that will captivate women's hearts.)

1395
00:48:33,199 --> 00:48:35,444
(This song is nice.)

1396
00:48:36,639 --> 00:48:37,669
I am getting ideas for the lyrics.

1397
00:48:37,670 --> 00:48:40,539
It could be the theme song for a movie.

1398
00:48:40,540 --> 00:48:42,109
I agree.

1399
00:48:42,110 --> 00:48:46,394
(The sentimental melody makes you recall a movie scene.)

1400
00:48:47,310 --> 00:48:50,349
(SORAN's ballad song that will top the digital music charts)

1401
00:48:50,350 --> 00:48:53,289
Gosh, this song...

1402
00:48:53,290 --> 00:48:54,677
I already have an idea for the lyrics.

1403
00:48:54,790 --> 00:48:57,588
Someone is watching from the sky.

1404
00:48:57,589 --> 00:48:58,588
- What? - Who is watching?

1405
00:48:58,589 --> 00:49:00,059
- Someone... - Grandpa?

1406
00:49:00,060 --> 00:49:02,899
It could be the grandpa, dad, or mom.

1407
00:49:02,900 --> 00:49:05,528
They make the rain fall or the sun shine.

1408
00:49:05,529 --> 00:49:06,798
I had that idea.

1409
00:49:06,799 --> 00:49:09,114
I think it could be a song about love.

1410
00:49:09,770 --> 00:49:10,891
That's a good idea.

1411
00:49:10,969 --> 00:49:13,081
Out of the songs we have,

1412
00:49:13,170 --> 00:49:16,939
I wrote one as I thought about my daughter.

1413
00:49:16,940 --> 00:49:18,204
- "Sunshine"? - Yes.

1414
00:49:18,679 --> 00:49:19,749
That song...

1415
00:49:19,750 --> 00:49:22,309
So Min, how involved are you in this band?

1416
00:49:22,310 --> 00:49:24,665
(So Min, how involved are you in this band?)

1417
00:49:25,480 --> 00:49:26,789
- She isn't involved. - Hold on.

1418
00:49:26,790 --> 00:49:28,789
- She just likes the band. - It seems like...

1419
00:49:28,790 --> 00:49:30,559
- My face turned red. - everyone else except for me...

1420
00:49:30,560 --> 00:49:31,886
is in the band.

1421
00:49:32,360 --> 00:49:33,528
("So Min Is Revealed As the 5th Member of SORAN")

1422
00:49:33,529 --> 00:49:35,758
- It looks like... - It's not like that.

1423
00:49:35,759 --> 00:49:37,738
the five of you are in the band.

1424
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:41,213
Why did you call me here?

1425
00:49:41,730 --> 00:49:43,169
What is going on?

1426
00:49:43,170 --> 00:49:44,292
(I knew something wasn't right.)

1427
00:49:44,440 --> 00:49:47,530
- You prepared three songs. - Yes.

1428
00:49:47,909 --> 00:49:49,368
This song is totally cheerful.

1429
00:49:50,080 --> 00:49:51,579
- It's very cheerful. - It's very cheerful.

1430
00:49:51,580 --> 00:49:53,548
- It's totally cheerful. - Okay. Let's hear it.

1431
00:49:53,549 --> 00:49:54,569
All right.

1432
00:49:55,679 --> 00:49:58,278
(The drum sound explodes from the start.)

1433
00:49:58,279 --> 00:50:00,799
(This is cheerful.)

1434
00:50:02,549 --> 00:50:06,189
(The beat and melody liven up the atmosphere.)

1435
00:50:06,190 --> 00:50:09,117
(They are in sync.)

1436
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:14,365
(SORAN's music is lively and cheerful.)

1437
00:50:15,569 --> 00:50:16,660
Sing anything.

1438
00:50:18,500 --> 00:50:22,212
(Singing)

1439
00:50:22,909 --> 00:50:24,809
(I knew you could do it!)

1440
00:50:24,810 --> 00:50:26,584
(I can't believe them.)

1441
00:50:27,080 --> 00:50:28,908
(Did So Min succeed to make a melody in one go?)

1442
00:50:28,909 --> 00:50:32,622
Hold on. Here is what I think.

1443
00:50:33,049 --> 00:50:35,218
You had a rehearsal, right?

1444
00:50:35,219 --> 00:50:36,218
Of course not.

1445
00:50:36,219 --> 00:50:38,942
How could you toss the microphone as if it's the most natural thing?

1446
00:50:39,460 --> 00:50:42,189
It's obvious that you had a rehearsal.

1447
00:50:42,190 --> 00:50:43,399
- That's not true. - Jeon So Min,

1448
00:50:43,400 --> 00:50:45,298
- how are you related to SORAN? - It's not like that.

1449
00:50:45,299 --> 00:50:46,368
Jeon SORAN.

1450
00:50:46,369 --> 00:50:47,798
("Band SORAN IS Actually Jeon SORAN")

1451
00:50:47,799 --> 00:50:50,085
Be quiet. Jae Seok will grow suspicious.

1452
00:50:50,739 --> 00:50:53,289
You will name the team Jeon SORAN and kick me out, right?

1453
00:50:53,509 --> 00:50:55,138
(Congratulations on forming Jeon SORAN)

1454
00:50:55,139 --> 00:50:56,405
For goodness' sake.

1455
00:50:57,040 --> 00:50:58,109
- Am I wrong? - Yes, you are.

1456
00:50:58,110 --> 00:50:59,338
- You are wrong. - You are wrong.

1457
00:50:59,339 --> 00:51:00,430
All right.

1458
00:51:00,610 --> 00:51:03,781
So Min, which song did you like?

1459
00:51:04,119 --> 00:51:07,318
If you don't like these three songs...

1460
00:51:07,319 --> 00:51:08,548
(He becomes a salesman.)

1461
00:51:08,549 --> 00:51:10,088
- There's more? - I could make three more songs...

1462
00:51:10,089 --> 00:51:11,140
and send them this week.

1463
00:51:11,759 --> 00:51:14,616
- That's incredible. - Is there a song factory?

1464
00:51:14,889 --> 00:51:18,258
Since we are a band, we can gather and work on songs anytime.

1465
00:51:18,259 --> 00:51:20,399
- Can you do that? - Jae Seok.

1466
00:51:20,400 --> 00:51:22,329
He doesn't even remember "Fake Love".

1467
00:51:22,330 --> 00:51:25,439
(He doesn't even remember "Fake Love".)

1468
00:51:25,440 --> 00:51:27,408
Can you really do that?

1469
00:51:27,710 --> 00:51:31,657
How can you do that when you don't even remember...

1470
00:51:32,040 --> 00:51:33,448
"Fake Love"?

1471
00:51:33,449 --> 00:51:34,979
- It's a different matter. - Really?

1472
00:51:34,980 --> 00:51:36,778
He can make new songs.

1473
00:51:36,779 --> 00:51:39,268
- He follows his feelings. - That's right.

1474
00:51:39,690 --> 00:51:42,249
Is there a keyword or a mood...

1475
00:51:42,250 --> 00:51:43,545
- Genre. - you want?

1476
00:51:43,619 --> 00:51:46,720
You could choose a genre or a part of the lyrics.

1477
00:51:46,830 --> 00:51:49,289
So Min, ask them to make a song for your poem.

1478
00:51:49,290 --> 00:51:50,459
If you recite your poem,

1479
00:51:50,460 --> 00:51:52,528
- we will make a song. - You wrote one at 2am.

1480
00:51:52,529 --> 00:51:54,203
Do you have a poem you wrote down?

1481
00:51:54,600 --> 00:51:55,798
Yes, I do. I have a lot of poems.

1482
00:51:55,799 --> 00:51:58,319
(Yes, I do. I have a lot of poems.)

1483
00:51:58,500 --> 00:51:59,561
Do you have a lot of poems?

1484
00:52:00,409 --> 00:52:01,634
She is not kidding.

1485
00:52:02,210 --> 00:52:03,913
- She has a lot of poems. - Which one should I use?

1486
00:52:04,139 --> 00:52:07,445
The nickname Jong Kook gave, Crazy Poet, suits her.

1487
00:52:07,779 --> 00:52:09,207
There are so many.

1488
00:52:09,650 --> 00:52:11,419
"Nothing to talk about but you."

1489
00:52:11,420 --> 00:52:12,847
It's too short.

1490
00:52:13,619 --> 00:52:15,218
- "Nothing to talk about but you." - "Nothing to talk about but you."

1491
00:52:15,219 --> 00:52:17,388
Yes. I wrote down that line.

1492
00:52:17,389 --> 00:52:18,818
"Nothing to talk about but you."

1493
00:52:19,089 --> 00:52:22,864
When I have a boyfriend, only my friends know about him.

1494
00:52:23,130 --> 00:52:26,158
After a breakup, I have nothing to talk about but him.

1495
00:52:26,159 --> 00:52:28,515
- It's only a line. - With your friends,

1496
00:52:28,830 --> 00:52:30,226
you talk about your ex.

1497
00:52:30,739 --> 00:52:32,499
That's the mood.

1498
00:52:32,500 --> 00:52:34,439
"Nothing to talk about but you."

1499
00:52:34,440 --> 00:52:35,970
Then it should be a bit melancholy.

1500
00:52:36,739 --> 00:52:38,508
"Nothing to talk about but you."

1501
00:52:38,509 --> 00:52:39,804
The key of B major.

1502
00:52:40,110 --> 00:52:41,349
I might cry.

1503
00:52:41,350 --> 00:52:44,149
"Nothing to talk about but you."

1504
00:52:44,150 --> 00:52:45,349
(The melody is produced right away.)

1505
00:52:45,350 --> 00:52:47,900
In 2, 3, 4.

1506
00:52:48,050 --> 00:52:50,749
"Nothing to talk about but you."

1507
00:52:50,750 --> 00:52:51,949
(The melody is produced right away.)

1508
00:52:51,950 --> 00:52:54,500
In 2, 3, 4.

1509
00:52:56,897 --> 00:52:59,351
2, 3, 4.

1510
00:52:59,352 --> 00:53:02,537
(They produce a ballad song after exchanging a few glances.)

1511
00:53:04,379 --> 00:53:05,838
Please turn off the camera so that I can cry.

1512
00:53:05,839 --> 00:53:07,548
I can't believe it.

1513
00:53:07,549 --> 00:53:09,548
(The melancholy melody suits the poem So Min wrote.)

1514
00:53:09,549 --> 00:53:10,702
It's fitting.

1515
00:53:11,120 --> 00:53:13,568
At a get-together with friends

1516
00:53:15,390 --> 00:53:19,258
There were many things I wanted to say

1517
00:53:19,259 --> 00:53:21,166
- This is fascinating. - Seriously.

1518
00:53:22,780 --> 00:53:28,431
Today, as always

1519
00:53:30,050 --> 00:53:34,458
I have nothing to talk about but you

1520
00:53:34,459 --> 00:53:36,531
(I have nothing to talk about but you)

1521
00:53:36,660 --> 00:53:39,828
(It's So Min's turn to sing...)

1522
00:53:39,829 --> 00:53:44,155
(to Yu Il's beats.)

1523
00:53:45,600 --> 00:53:51,046
I have nothing to talk about but you

1524
00:53:51,470 --> 00:53:52,538
All right.

1525
00:53:52,539 --> 00:53:53,559
(It's cringe-worthy.)

1526
00:53:54,180 --> 00:53:55,608
(SORAN's performance suits...)

1527
00:53:55,609 --> 00:53:57,449
For goodness' sake.

1528
00:53:57,450 --> 00:53:59,308
(the emotions So Min felt when she wrote the poem.)

1529
00:53:59,309 --> 00:54:00,849
(Embarrassed)

1530
00:54:00,850 --> 00:54:03,022
Stop tucking your hair behind your ear.

1531
00:54:03,550 --> 00:54:04,688
You will graze your skin.

1532
00:54:04,689 --> 00:54:05,949
(I am a woman with a past.)

1533
00:54:05,950 --> 00:54:07,755
You will graze your skin.

1534
00:54:08,419 --> 00:54:10,531
Stop tucking your hair behind your ear.

1535
00:54:10,990 --> 00:54:13,058
(Poet Jeon So Min and SORAN had a successful jam session.)

1536
00:54:13,059 --> 00:54:14,079
So Min.

1537
00:54:14,260 --> 00:54:15,998
It's so fascinating.

1538
00:54:15,999 --> 00:54:17,369
I know.

1539
00:54:17,370 --> 00:54:19,699
I have so many poems right here.

1540
00:54:19,700 --> 00:54:23,065
(I have so many poems right here.)

1541
00:54:24,870 --> 00:54:26,808
(Poet Jeon and SORAN could have endless collaborations.)

1542
00:54:26,809 --> 00:54:29,009
She has so many poems.

1543
00:54:29,010 --> 00:54:31,978
I have many poems. "You can call me at night."

1544
00:54:31,979 --> 00:54:33,148
That's one.

1545
00:54:33,149 --> 00:54:35,526
("You can call me at night"?)

1546
00:54:35,820 --> 00:54:36,989
In that case...

1547
00:54:36,990 --> 00:54:38,619
She is resolute.

1548
00:54:38,620 --> 00:54:40,788
- "You can call me at night." - The lyrics are very resolute.

1549
00:54:40,789 --> 00:54:42,589
"You can call me at night."

1550
00:54:42,590 --> 00:54:44,759
Here is another one. "I don't remember..."

1551
00:54:44,760 --> 00:54:47,898
"which ramyeon I had..."

1552
00:54:47,899 --> 00:54:48,998
"with you."

1553
00:54:48,999 --> 00:54:50,224
That's a good one.

1554
00:54:50,700 --> 00:54:52,328
"I don't remember which ramyeon I had with you".

1555
00:54:52,329 --> 00:54:53,901
I will start with that...

1556
00:54:54,200 --> 00:54:55,969
- and wrap up... - Okay.

1557
00:54:55,970 --> 00:54:57,468
- with "You can call me at night." - Okay.

1558
00:55:00,379 --> 00:55:02,139
This is so fascinating.

1559
00:55:02,140 --> 00:55:03,378
(The melody comes out right away.)

1560
00:55:03,379 --> 00:55:04,431
All right.

1561
00:55:07,019 --> 00:55:09,319
It's good. It's good.

1562
00:55:09,320 --> 00:55:11,288
(In a flash, they jump to the middle of the night.)

1563
00:55:13,249 --> 00:55:15,911
I will tell you this

1564
00:55:17,329 --> 00:55:20,699
Since you aren't drinking

1565
00:55:20,700 --> 00:55:22,058
It suits the mood.

1566
00:55:22,059 --> 00:55:23,182
- It's perfect. - Yes.

1567
00:55:23,370 --> 00:55:29,239
I don't remember which ramyeon I had with you

1568
00:55:29,240 --> 00:55:33,069
You can call me at night

1569
00:55:33,070 --> 00:55:36,987
(You can call me at night)

1570
00:55:37,280 --> 00:55:41,299
You can call me at night

1571
00:55:42,249 --> 00:55:44,738
- How should it go? - Give the microphone to So Min.

1572
00:55:45,090 --> 00:55:47,259
(So Min gets the microphone.)

1573
00:55:47,260 --> 00:55:50,589
You can call me at night

1574
00:55:50,590 --> 00:55:53,089
- I am singing out of tune. - You are doing well.

1575
00:55:53,090 --> 00:55:54,222
(Laughing)

1576
00:55:55,329 --> 00:55:59,582
It's okay because I am drunk

1577
00:56:02,070 --> 00:56:04,721
All right. All right. It seems like...

1578
00:56:05,070 --> 00:56:07,078
SORAN and So Min have good teamwork.

1579
00:56:07,079 --> 00:56:10,078
She is pretty good. I think she is better than me.

1580
00:56:10,079 --> 00:56:11,349
Seriously.

1581
00:56:11,350 --> 00:56:13,949
I can't believe you came up with a song right away.

1582
00:56:13,950 --> 00:56:15,478
- It's fascinating. - Then why can't you play...

1583
00:56:15,479 --> 00:56:16,748
"Fake Love"?

1584
00:56:16,749 --> 00:56:17,989
(Then why can't you play "Fake Love"?)

1585
00:56:17,990 --> 00:56:21,560
(You can have an impromptu jam session.)

1586
00:56:22,260 --> 00:56:23,891
You are talented enough to do this.

1587
00:56:24,260 --> 00:56:26,749
Why can't you play "Fake Love"?

1588
00:56:27,200 --> 00:56:28,958
He should practice, but...

1589
00:56:28,959 --> 00:56:30,599
- He doesn't practice. - He keeps saying he can't do it.

1590
00:56:30,600 --> 00:56:32,398
I will play a bit of it.

1591
00:56:32,399 --> 00:56:34,031
(I will play a bit of it.)

1592
00:56:34,269 --> 00:56:35,398
This is the first time.

1593
00:56:35,399 --> 00:56:36,899
- Seriously. - He never plays it.

1594
00:56:37,370 --> 00:56:40,022
- It will be really short. - It's okay.

1595
00:56:44,780 --> 00:56:47,677
(This melody is...)

1596
00:56:49,379 --> 00:56:55,714
(It's the guitar intro of "Fake Love" by BTS.)

1597
00:56:57,090 --> 00:57:00,628
(They hear the live performance of the guitar accompaniment...)

1598
00:57:00,629 --> 00:57:02,358
He can play it.

1599
00:57:02,359 --> 00:57:03,898
(Tae Wook recorded for the song.)

1600
00:57:03,899 --> 00:57:07,369
- Then it moves on. - Tae Wook is amazing.

1601
00:57:07,370 --> 00:57:10,869
- I heard it for the first time. - SORAN can do anything.

1602
00:57:10,870 --> 00:57:12,009
- That's right. - They cover all genres.

1603
00:57:12,010 --> 00:57:13,708
They cover all genres.

1604
00:57:13,709 --> 00:57:18,166
SORAN and So Min go well together in terms of sentimentality.

1605
00:57:18,709 --> 00:57:19,779
I'm the one who doesn't fit.

1606
00:57:19,780 --> 00:57:22,578
(That's the problem.)

1607
00:57:22,579 --> 00:57:24,389
(Jae Seok got fooled by the 5 members of Jeon SORAN.)

1608
00:57:24,390 --> 00:57:28,265
SORAN and So Min go well together, but I don't.

1609
00:57:28,590 --> 00:57:29,788
I am the problem.

1610
00:57:29,789 --> 00:57:32,339
(Will Jae Seok be able to perform with Jeon SORAN?)

1611
00:57:33,660 --> 00:57:35,498
(Meanwhile, a studio in Gangnam)

1612
00:57:35,499 --> 00:57:36,529
Hello.

1613
00:57:36,530 --> 00:57:37,969
- Hello. - Hello.

1614
00:57:37,970 --> 00:57:39,020
Hello.

1615
00:57:40,269 --> 00:57:42,869
- It has been a while. - It has been a while.

1616
00:57:42,870 --> 00:57:43,931
It has been a while.

1617
00:57:44,070 --> 00:57:46,208
It's an honor to work with you.

1618
00:57:46,209 --> 00:57:47,779
Their voices...

1619
00:57:47,780 --> 00:57:49,239
(He stops in the middle of high-fiving everyone...)

1620
00:57:49,240 --> 00:57:51,208
(and makes a U-turn.)

1621
00:57:51,209 --> 00:57:54,378
Why didn't you high-five me? High-five me.

1622
00:57:54,379 --> 00:57:56,319
It's enough that I high-fived half of the group.

1623
00:57:56,320 --> 00:57:57,319
(Shortened greetings)

1624
00:57:57,320 --> 00:57:59,563
- What? - We don't have much time.

1625
00:57:59,850 --> 00:58:01,145
For goodness' sake.

1626
00:58:01,390 --> 00:58:02,889
Let's sit down.

1627
00:58:02,890 --> 00:58:04,688
A bit later,

1628
00:58:04,689 --> 00:58:06,858
we will meet a composer who will help us.

1629
00:58:06,859 --> 00:58:08,328
- A composer? - Yes.

1630
00:58:08,329 --> 00:58:10,542
We are having a meeting for the theme today.

1631
00:58:11,100 --> 00:58:13,328
Are we have a meeting for the theme today?

1632
00:58:13,329 --> 00:58:15,199
(Is that what we are doing today?)

1633
00:58:15,200 --> 00:58:16,398
What did you think we were doing today?

1634
00:58:16,399 --> 00:58:18,108
- I had no idea. - I am so confused right now.

1635
00:58:18,109 --> 00:58:20,221
We dance when we are asked to dance.

1636
00:58:20,510 --> 00:58:22,958
- I wonder who the composer will be. - Hey!

1637
00:58:23,140 --> 00:58:25,978
(Who will be composing the song for Team Apink?)

1638
00:58:25,979 --> 00:58:30,610
Gosh, you look like a designer.

1639
00:58:31,019 --> 00:58:33,162
(Composer Nang)

1640
00:58:33,820 --> 00:58:36,589
(The melody you remember after hearing it only once.)

1641
00:58:36,590 --> 00:58:38,389
("LUV" by Apink)

1642
00:58:38,390 --> 00:58:41,599
("Bboom Bboom" by MOMOLAND)

1643
00:58:41,600 --> 00:58:44,762
("Up and Down" by EXID)

1644
00:58:45,329 --> 00:58:48,599
(Every song he composes makes it into the charts.)

1645
00:58:48,600 --> 00:58:51,168
Hello, I am Nang of B and N.

1646
00:58:51,169 --> 00:58:52,435
It's nice to meet you.

1647
00:58:53,169 --> 00:58:55,538
- Nang. - Nang.

1648
00:58:55,539 --> 00:58:58,009
I am nervous to meet a big-time composer.

1649
00:58:58,010 --> 00:58:59,378
- Really? - I am nervous.

1650
00:58:59,379 --> 00:59:01,119
- The two of us... - Seok Jin will realize his dream...

1651
00:59:01,120 --> 00:59:02,148
of becoming a singer.

1652
00:59:02,149 --> 00:59:05,319
I will put my life on the line for this.

1653
00:59:05,320 --> 00:59:07,360
- Seriously. - Really?

1654
00:59:07,490 --> 00:59:10,788
Let's hear you sing. I need to do a key check.

1655
00:59:10,789 --> 00:59:13,288
- I need to see how well... - What's a key check?

1656
00:59:13,289 --> 00:59:14,529
We...

1657
00:59:14,530 --> 00:59:16,199
(What kind of a key is he talking about?)

1658
00:59:16,200 --> 00:59:18,599
- It's to see your vocal range. - I see.

1659
00:59:18,600 --> 00:59:20,869
All right. How about...

1660
00:59:20,870 --> 00:59:23,389
- we sing in here? - Okay.

1661
00:59:23,539 --> 00:59:26,239
- I will sing "I Miss You". - Please go ahead.

1662
00:59:26,240 --> 00:59:27,978
It's his favorite song to sing.

1663
00:59:27,979 --> 00:59:29,846
(Will he really sing "I Miss You" by Kim Bum Soo?)

1664
00:59:30,510 --> 00:59:32,416
He also likes to sing "Love" by Jo Jang Hyuk.

1665
00:59:33,010 --> 00:59:35,119
- I will play the melody. - "The memories..."

1666
00:59:35,120 --> 00:59:36,303
(The test begins in earnest.)

1667
00:59:36,990 --> 00:59:37,989
(How well can Kwang Soo sing?)

1668
00:59:37,990 --> 00:59:39,418
In 2, 3.

1669
00:59:39,789 --> 00:59:43,259
The memories

1670
00:59:43,260 --> 00:59:45,535
(It's the perfect cacophony.)

1671
00:59:46,030 --> 00:59:47,498
Please let me start over.

1672
00:59:47,499 --> 00:59:48,898
(He quickly gives up.)

1673
00:59:48,899 --> 00:59:51,449
Please give me one more chance.

1674
00:59:51,899 --> 00:59:54,599
(He crushes their expectations.)

1675
00:59:54,600 --> 00:59:56,498
- Give me one more chance. - All right.

1676
00:59:56,499 --> 00:59:58,855
- I will sing properly this time. - Okay.

1677
00:59:59,410 --> 01:00:01,653
- You can do this. - Don't be nervous.

1678
01:00:01,709 --> 01:00:03,137
Don't be nervous.

1679
01:00:03,309 --> 01:00:04,881
- This is great. - You got this.

1680
01:00:05,379 --> 01:00:07,219
(He warms up his throat and goes again.)

1681
01:00:07,220 --> 01:00:08,912
In 2, 3.

1682
01:00:09,079 --> 01:00:13,719
The memories of loving you

1683
01:00:13,720 --> 01:00:16,719
Like crazy

1684
01:00:16,720 --> 01:00:19,106
(The memories of loving you like crazy)

1685
01:00:19,629 --> 01:00:22,046
(He can hit high notes.)

1686
01:00:23,200 --> 01:00:27,998
(The recollections)

1687
01:00:27,999 --> 01:00:31,580
(Look for you)

1688
01:00:31,870 --> 01:00:33,441
(I didn't think his voice would go up.)

1689
01:00:33,640 --> 01:00:36,438
(I can no longer)

1690
01:00:36,439 --> 01:00:39,449
(It sounds like he is herding cows.)

1691
01:00:39,450 --> 01:00:42,378
(He wraps up like a singer.)

1692
01:00:42,379 --> 01:00:44,491
You did a good job.

1693
01:00:44,890 --> 01:00:47,188
- It's was the original key, right? - Yes.

1694
01:00:47,189 --> 01:00:49,358
He sang better than I expected.

1695
01:00:49,359 --> 01:00:50,615
All right.

1696
01:00:50,859 --> 01:00:52,628
Is there a genre...

1697
01:00:52,629 --> 01:00:54,699
- or a concept you have in mind? - Is there?

1698
01:00:54,700 --> 01:00:56,498
There used to be a group called Sharp.

1699
01:00:56,499 --> 01:00:57,826
That's right.

1700
01:00:57,870 --> 01:00:58,998
"Sweety".

1701
01:00:58,999 --> 01:01:00,228
That's right.

1702
01:01:00,229 --> 01:01:02,369
I love it. I love it.

1703
01:01:02,370 --> 01:01:04,268
This is really nice.

1704
01:01:04,269 --> 01:01:07,575
(Cheerful music like Sharp's would go well with Team Apink.)

1705
01:01:08,309 --> 01:01:10,009
- It will be fun. - Girl groups need to have...

1706
01:01:10,010 --> 01:01:12,091
the right facial expressions on the stage.

1707
01:01:12,550 --> 01:01:15,578
(The right facial expressions matter as much as the singing skills.)

1708
01:01:15,579 --> 01:01:17,688
- That's right. - Acting skills.

1709
01:01:17,689 --> 01:01:19,628
We won't be able to look cute.

1710
01:01:19,789 --> 01:01:21,351
Right?

1711
01:01:21,590 --> 01:01:22,619
I have never tried it.

1712
01:01:22,620 --> 01:01:24,629
(We will give you a demonstration.)

1713
01:01:25,329 --> 01:01:28,185
(Such freshness is rare on Running Man.)

1714
01:01:28,760 --> 01:01:30,870
That was the facial expression!

1715
01:01:31,430 --> 01:01:33,699
(When she dances to the rhythm naturally,)

1716
01:01:33,700 --> 01:01:35,498
(her fresh charms explode.)

1717
01:01:35,499 --> 01:01:37,139
- That's how you do it. - She is really good.

1718
01:01:37,140 --> 01:01:38,802
Their facial expressions are a work of art.

1719
01:01:40,809 --> 01:01:43,532
Bo Mi, my goodness.

1720
01:01:45,010 --> 01:01:47,748
(She melts men's hearts...)

1721
01:01:47,749 --> 01:01:50,647
(with the alluring finale.)

1722
01:01:51,749 --> 01:01:54,889
(The epitome of perfection)

1723
01:01:54,890 --> 01:01:56,589
That was the facial expression!

1724
01:01:56,590 --> 01:01:58,188
We will be an eyesore if we try those facial expressions.

1725
01:01:58,189 --> 01:02:00,358
Would you do the chorus?

1726
01:02:00,359 --> 01:02:01,699
Their facial expressions changed...

1727
01:02:01,700 --> 01:02:03,199
in accordance with the lyrics.

1728
01:02:03,200 --> 01:02:05,498
They didn't only smile. They glared as well.

1729
01:02:05,499 --> 01:02:07,377
- There was a hint of sadness too. - Yes.

1730
01:02:07,769 --> 01:02:08,898
How do they change their facial expressions so fast?

1731
01:02:08,899 --> 01:02:10,509
I will play the song.

1732
01:02:10,510 --> 01:02:12,887
Let's see how it looks.

1733
01:02:13,410 --> 01:02:14,409
(They watched Apink's performance.)

1734
01:02:14,410 --> 01:02:17,449
1, 2, 3. Do you remember?

1735
01:02:17,450 --> 01:02:19,349
(He moves to the rhythm.)

1736
01:02:19,350 --> 01:02:22,134
(Please open the door.)

1737
01:02:22,879 --> 01:02:24,827
That's not our dance.

1738
01:02:24,950 --> 01:02:26,788
L, O, V, E, love

1739
01:02:26,789 --> 01:02:29,858
Are you having a seizure? Are you getting an electric shock?

1740
01:02:29,859 --> 01:02:31,328
(Electric shock dance)

1741
01:02:31,329 --> 01:02:33,188
An electric shock!

1742
01:02:33,189 --> 01:02:34,858
(His unique dance...)

1743
01:02:34,859 --> 01:02:37,684
(makes them scream.)

1744
01:02:39,470 --> 01:02:40,768
(How do I look?)

1745
01:02:40,769 --> 01:02:44,409
(I look refreshing, right?)

1746
01:02:44,410 --> 01:02:47,132
(It looks like he is channeling a spirit.)

1747
01:02:47,410 --> 01:02:48,908
He is good.

1748
01:02:50,979 --> 01:02:52,949
Gosh, I am sweating.

1749
01:02:53,850 --> 01:02:55,410
He is good.

1750
01:02:55,680 --> 01:02:57,748
(They have no words.)

1751
01:02:57,749 --> 01:03:00,619
This audition is necessary for the performance, right?

1752
01:03:00,620 --> 01:03:03,037
(This audition is necessary for the performance, right?)

1753
01:03:03,289 --> 01:03:06,429
- I had to ask. - Do we need to act cute?

1754
01:03:06,430 --> 01:03:08,367
(What kind of a song will be created?)

1755
01:03:08,959 --> 01:03:11,652
- My goodness. - Have you been well?

1756
01:03:11,970 --> 01:03:14,339
This is Code Kunst's company,

1757
01:03:14,340 --> 01:03:15,868
- You must have made a lot of money. - AOMG.

1758
01:03:15,869 --> 01:03:17,368
- That's right. - The building is very big.

1759
01:03:17,369 --> 01:03:18,509
- Let's sit down. - Okay.

1760
01:03:18,510 --> 01:03:20,308
So, what do you think?

1761
01:03:20,309 --> 01:03:21,534
Will things work out?

1762
01:03:21,740 --> 01:03:24,708
We have starred in a few audition programs.

1763
01:03:24,809 --> 01:03:26,748
Things always work out. Don't worry.

1764
01:03:26,749 --> 01:03:29,126
I have recorded rap verses...

1765
01:03:29,320 --> 01:03:30,379
a few times.

1766
01:03:30,380 --> 01:03:31,449
- Really? - Yes.

1767
01:03:31,450 --> 01:03:34,041
- You have never done it, right? - I have done it...

1768
01:03:34,260 --> 01:03:35,280
for Gary's...

1769
01:03:35,690 --> 01:03:36,984
"Turned off the TV".

1770
01:03:37,090 --> 01:03:40,118
- That's right. - I did Yoon Mi Rae's part.

1771
01:03:40,260 --> 01:03:41,859
Gary told me not to do it again.

1772
01:03:41,860 --> 01:03:43,899
(Gary told me not to do it again.)

1773
01:03:43,900 --> 01:03:46,368
(You should stay an actress.)

1774
01:03:46,369 --> 01:03:48,498
If Gary said that...

1775
01:03:48,499 --> 01:03:51,090
He was like, "Are you singing a children's song?"

1776
01:03:51,740 --> 01:03:54,228
Will you be able to fix her part, Code Kunst?

1777
01:03:54,880 --> 01:03:56,279
- I will be able to do that. - Really?

1778
01:03:56,280 --> 01:03:58,509
- It's the power of digital devices. - Computers are advanced these days.

1779
01:03:58,510 --> 01:04:00,248
- Really? - We can use technologies.

1780
01:04:00,249 --> 01:04:02,978
You can trust the power of digital devices.

1781
01:04:02,979 --> 01:04:04,788
- Really? I see. - The recording will be nice.

1782
01:04:04,789 --> 01:04:06,589
But we won't be allowed to lip-sync. We need to sing.

1783
01:04:06,590 --> 01:04:07,989
That's right.

1784
01:04:07,990 --> 01:04:10,288
There is such a thing as doubling.

1785
01:04:10,289 --> 01:04:11,788
- So we just overlap it? - Right.

1786
01:04:11,789 --> 01:04:14,043
- With everything in the background. - I just adjust it all.

1787
01:04:14,559 --> 01:04:15,987
- Or... - Look at these guys.

1788
01:04:16,030 --> 01:04:19,263
- They're like con artists. - For example...

1789
01:04:19,599 --> 01:04:20,669
What are you talking about?

1790
01:04:20,670 --> 01:04:22,569
- They're con artists. - That's not it.

1791
01:04:22,570 --> 01:04:24,069
I want someone else from AOMG.

1792
01:04:24,070 --> 01:04:25,609
- Get me someone else. - That's not it.

1793
01:04:25,610 --> 01:04:27,839
- That's not what we mean. - I see you're trying to con us.

1794
01:04:27,840 --> 01:04:29,538
- We were about to get fooled. - Wait a second.

1795
01:04:29,539 --> 01:04:31,178
- Did you do this every time? - No.

1796
01:04:31,179 --> 01:04:32,780
- Using tricks... - No, no.

1797
01:04:32,880 --> 01:04:35,149
- That's not it. - We don't need that trick.

1798
01:04:35,150 --> 01:04:36,248
- Right? - But...

1799
01:04:36,249 --> 01:04:38,348
- for amateurs like... - Oh, so you use that technique...

1800
01:04:38,349 --> 01:04:40,049
for amateurs.

1801
01:04:40,050 --> 01:04:42,288
- And you have to be good. - You have to be good to begin with.

1802
01:04:42,289 --> 01:04:43,719
- That's a given. - Right, right.

1803
01:04:43,720 --> 01:04:47,780
But even if you do things poorly, these techniques will cover for it.

1804
01:04:47,900 --> 01:04:49,498
That's all you need to know.

1805
01:04:49,499 --> 01:04:51,368
(Don't worry. Your ability can be boosted at any time.)

1806
01:04:51,369 --> 01:04:52,931
Gosh, it's confusing.

1807
01:04:52,970 --> 01:04:56,169
Don't you have a lot of songs in your flash drive, Code Kunst?

1808
01:04:56,170 --> 01:04:58,109
- You must have many hidden songs. - Right.

1809
01:04:58,110 --> 01:05:00,439
I think we still have to make a new song.

1810
01:05:00,440 --> 01:05:02,856
Right, based on something that's already been made.

1811
01:05:03,139 --> 01:05:05,760
I have one in mind. The kind of rap I want to do.

1812
01:05:05,809 --> 01:05:07,758
- In the middle of the performance, - What is it?

1813
01:05:07,820 --> 01:05:10,118
the lights would turn off,

1814
01:05:10,119 --> 01:05:11,788
and I'd rap like crazy without any accompaniment.

1815
01:05:11,789 --> 01:05:13,585
That's like BewhY.

1816
01:05:13,990 --> 01:05:16,319
(The way BewhY raps is to do it under the spotlight.)

1817
01:05:16,320 --> 01:05:19,089
I'd stand under the spotlight with the sound of heavy breathing.

1818
01:05:19,090 --> 01:05:20,388
(He wants the spotlight and the sound of heavy breathing.)

1819
01:05:20,389 --> 01:05:22,029
People would wonder what this is about.

1820
01:05:22,030 --> 01:05:23,630
- Then I'd start rapping. - With the light shining on you.

1821
01:05:23,900 --> 01:05:26,029
(Shooting out his rap)

1822
01:05:26,030 --> 01:05:27,899
- Like how BewhY does. - Like BewhY.

1823
01:05:27,900 --> 01:05:29,164
(Audience cheering)

1824
01:05:29,300 --> 01:05:31,408
Your mouth looks similar to that of BewhY.

1825
01:05:31,409 --> 01:05:32,664
- A bit, right? - Yes.

1826
01:05:32,740 --> 01:05:35,157
BewhY and Dok2.

1827
01:05:35,179 --> 01:05:36,908
(He wants to perform like BewhY and look like Dok2.)

1828
01:05:36,909 --> 01:05:37,971
"I'm Dok2."

1829
01:05:38,550 --> 01:05:40,722
"I'm Dok2. Get me a building."

1830
01:05:41,179 --> 01:05:44,518
(In short, he wants to do everything that's cool.)

1831
01:05:44,519 --> 01:05:47,518
I want something with a strong climax.

1832
01:05:47,519 --> 01:05:51,928
I'll bring some songs I have. Around three of them.

1833
01:05:51,929 --> 01:05:54,245
Let's see what your preference is by listening to them.

1834
01:05:54,260 --> 01:05:56,498
Just feel free to choose what you like.

1835
01:05:56,499 --> 01:05:57,928
Choose something that's easy to pull tricks.

1836
01:05:57,929 --> 01:05:59,428
(Don't be like that.)

1837
01:05:59,429 --> 01:06:00,699
Wouldn't that be good for us?

1838
01:06:00,700 --> 01:06:02,239
- A song that's easy to pull tricks. - I've brought songs...

1839
01:06:02,240 --> 01:06:03,699
- Let's do that. - with that in mind.

1840
01:06:04,610 --> 01:06:05,997
- Let's check your preference. - Okay.

1841
01:06:06,070 --> 01:06:07,138
Okay.

1842
01:06:07,139 --> 01:06:08,405
I've got everything here.

1843
01:06:08,510 --> 01:06:10,078
A bad guy, an excited guy,

1844
01:06:10,079 --> 01:06:11,808
- A strange guy, a sad guy. - and a sad guy.

1845
01:06:11,809 --> 01:06:13,483
What kind of guy do you want to be?

1846
01:06:13,679 --> 01:06:14,802
A crazy guy.

1847
01:06:15,920 --> 01:06:17,041
"A crazy guy"?

1848
01:06:17,950 --> 01:06:19,049
A mad guy.

1849
01:06:19,050 --> 01:06:21,819
(He wants to be crazy on stage.)

1850
01:06:21,820 --> 01:06:24,063
(It's beyond imagination.)

1851
01:06:24,459 --> 01:06:26,529
(His fiery eyes are full of madness.)

1852
01:06:26,530 --> 01:06:28,058
(I think his dream has already come true.)

1853
01:06:28,059 --> 01:06:29,428
People would cheer.

1854
01:06:29,429 --> 01:06:31,103
(Making weird sounds)

1855
01:06:31,269 --> 01:06:33,411
- That's wrestling. - No, I mean...

1856
01:06:33,429 --> 01:06:35,699
- What is this? - I've got to do it.

1857
01:06:35,700 --> 01:06:36,798
I've got to hear my audience shout.

1858
01:06:36,799 --> 01:06:38,065
Ji Hyo and I have to hear that.

1859
01:06:38,210 --> 01:06:39,638
"Ji Hyo!" Like this.

1860
01:06:39,910 --> 01:06:42,279
- I want madness. - Okay.

1861
01:06:42,280 --> 01:06:45,249
This would be good for festivals.

1862
01:06:45,250 --> 01:06:46,708
(The first beat prepared by Code Kunst)

1863
01:06:47,620 --> 01:06:49,997
- It's "Orange". This one's nice. - This is...

1864
01:06:50,150 --> 01:06:51,343
This one is really nice.

1865
01:06:51,650 --> 01:06:52,772
I'd make an appearance here.

1866
01:06:53,719 --> 01:06:55,800
- He's imagining the performance. - I am.

1867
01:06:56,089 --> 01:06:58,201
- Like this. - He's a professional.

1868
01:06:58,629 --> 01:07:00,527
You'd come up from the bottom of the stage.

1869
01:07:00,660 --> 01:07:01,829
I like this.

1870
01:07:01,830 --> 01:07:03,128
(It makes them imagine their performance just by listening.)

1871
01:07:03,129 --> 01:07:04,190
Then goes the rap.

1872
01:07:04,500 --> 01:07:05,652
Oh, yes.

1873
01:07:06,400 --> 01:07:07,798
(They love the beat.)

1874
01:07:07,799 --> 01:07:09,196
- Good. - This is one.

1875
01:07:10,040 --> 01:07:12,385
- This is one. - I love it.

1876
01:07:12,410 --> 01:07:14,109
- The second one has a theme. - What is it?

1877
01:07:14,110 --> 01:07:16,997
Its title is "Before the Club".

1878
01:07:17,040 --> 01:07:20,681
It's about the excitement right before you enter a club.

1879
01:07:21,019 --> 01:07:22,048
(She knows how it feels.)

1880
01:07:22,049 --> 01:07:23,274
Let's listen to it.

1881
01:07:23,849 --> 01:07:24,940
Good.

1882
01:07:25,349 --> 01:07:27,489
But the club is a bit classy.

1883
01:07:27,490 --> 01:07:29,119
- A high-class club. - With champagne served.

1884
01:07:29,120 --> 01:07:31,228
(He knows the feeling.)

1885
01:07:31,229 --> 01:07:32,888
(A luxurious champagne party)

1886
01:07:32,889 --> 01:07:34,796
This would be played in slow motion.

1887
01:07:34,860 --> 01:07:36,029
And I'd do this next to you.

1888
01:07:36,030 --> 01:07:37,253
(She'd do this beside him.)

1889
01:07:37,929 --> 01:07:41,336
(Showing off her luxurious body wave)

1890
01:07:41,370 --> 01:07:42,968
- It's nice. - I like this.

1891
01:07:42,969 --> 01:07:44,398
It feels like summer.

1892
01:07:44,769 --> 01:07:46,779
(Shall I go in now?)

1893
01:07:47,410 --> 01:07:50,674
(The player enters the club.)

1894
01:07:51,509 --> 01:07:52,673
Popping champagne.

1895
01:07:53,509 --> 01:07:55,548
(Champagne is popped, and the mood goes popping.)

1896
01:07:55,549 --> 01:07:58,289
(And her body wave as the finishing touch)

1897
01:07:58,290 --> 01:07:59,289
(Nucksal and Code Kunst's luxurious club party)

1898
01:07:59,290 --> 01:08:00,411
That looks good, Ji Hyo.

1899
01:08:00,990 --> 01:08:02,558
They're good.

1900
01:08:02,559 --> 01:08:04,829
(They've fallen in love with the second beat as well.)

1901
01:08:04,830 --> 01:08:06,058
This one's incredible too.

1902
01:08:06,059 --> 01:08:07,488
- Our fans would love it. - These kinds of mood...

1903
01:08:07,530 --> 01:08:09,193
- But... - "But"?

1904
01:08:09,400 --> 01:08:11,029
Because it's actually... Ji Hyo.

1905
01:08:11,030 --> 01:08:13,569
I'm worried so much to be honest.

1906
01:08:13,570 --> 01:08:15,439
What's making you worried?

1907
01:08:15,440 --> 01:08:17,204
- What's your biggest concern? - What is it?

1908
01:08:17,269 --> 01:08:20,138
- I feel like I have to do well. - I see.

1909
01:08:20,139 --> 01:08:22,424
- Just have fun. - That's the hip-hop spirit.

1910
01:08:22,479 --> 01:08:23,609
Why don't you...

1911
01:08:23,610 --> 01:08:26,466
show us how you do that part, Ji Hyo?

1912
01:08:26,679 --> 01:08:28,586
You mentioned you rapped in "Turned off the TV".

1913
01:08:28,780 --> 01:08:29,878
Right, I did.

1914
01:08:29,879 --> 01:08:31,619
- Do you remember the lyrics? - Yes.

1915
01:08:31,620 --> 01:08:33,078
- Did you memorize them? - Of course.

1916
01:08:33,650 --> 01:08:34,789
All right.

1917
01:08:34,790 --> 01:08:36,554
(They play the song first.)

1918
01:08:36,589 --> 01:08:38,935
It's a part that goes, "Why are you turning off the TV when it's hot?"

1919
01:08:39,990 --> 01:08:41,899
- It's here. - Why are you drawing the curtains?

1920
01:08:41,900 --> 01:08:44,369
I'm watching TV, so why are you turning it off?

1921
01:08:44,370 --> 01:08:47,029
Why are you looking at me like that again?

1922
01:08:47,030 --> 01:08:49,590
I'm tired, I just want to sleep

1923
01:08:50,269 --> 01:08:52,044
(This is why Gary told her never to rap again.)

1924
01:08:52,509 --> 01:08:53,609
(Mumbling)

1925
01:08:53,610 --> 01:08:55,808
It's so funny, I'll think about it

1926
01:08:55,809 --> 01:08:56,978
Go turn the lights off

1927
01:08:56,979 --> 01:08:58,173
- I'm so embarrassed - No.

1928
01:08:58,450 --> 01:09:00,010
- Ji Hyo. - Turn off the cameras.

1929
01:09:00,450 --> 01:09:02,518
- Turn off the cameras. - Goodness.

1930
01:09:02,519 --> 01:09:04,018
- Turn off the lights. - Lights off.

1931
01:09:04,019 --> 01:09:05,926
- Turn the lights off. - And the TV too.

1932
01:09:06,089 --> 01:09:09,119
(Her rapping skills make them want to turn everything off.)

1933
01:09:09,120 --> 01:09:11,231
- Turn them off. - Turn off every machine here.

1934
01:09:12,360 --> 01:09:13,513
Turn all the machines off.

1935
01:09:13,759 --> 01:09:15,361
Turn off your phones. Turn it all off.

1936
01:09:16,360 --> 01:09:17,654
Is that enough?

1937
01:09:17,799 --> 01:09:18,928
Oh, yes.

1938
01:09:18,929 --> 01:09:21,098
(Digital technology is their superpower.)

1939
01:09:21,099 --> 01:09:22,199
Are you serious?

1940
01:09:22,200 --> 01:09:23,268
As long as you can talk, it's good enough.

1941
01:09:23,269 --> 01:09:24,463
As long as we can hear your voice.

1942
01:09:25,040 --> 01:09:27,579
I don't think I can trust you guys.

1943
01:09:27,580 --> 01:09:30,027
- What's wrong with you? - Is this really a company?

1944
01:09:30,080 --> 01:09:32,457
I'm confused. Can I trust really them?

1945
01:09:32,509 --> 01:09:34,489
As long as you can stamp your feet and clap your hands,

1946
01:09:35,650 --> 01:09:36,918
we can make a song for you.

1947
01:09:36,919 --> 01:09:38,481
(Ji Hyo will be a digital rapper in the 21st century.)

1948
01:09:38,490 --> 01:09:40,764
We need to hear Se Chan rap properly too.

1949
01:09:41,120 --> 01:09:42,650
Me? All right.

1950
01:09:43,320 --> 01:09:44,989
- What can you do? - I'll do something I can show off.

1951
01:09:44,990 --> 01:09:46,357
Is there any song you enjoy singing at karaoke rooms?

1952
01:09:46,690 --> 01:09:48,770
- "Guilty". - "Guilty", okay.

1953
01:09:49,259 --> 01:09:51,778
(Rapping clearly)

1954
01:09:52,129 --> 01:09:56,995
(He shows an unexpected rapping ability with clear diction.)

1955
01:09:57,500 --> 01:09:59,109
(He eventually becomes out of breath.)

1956
01:09:59,110 --> 01:10:01,808
I think I have to break up with her today

1957
01:10:01,809 --> 01:10:03,002
He's out of breath.

1958
01:10:04,509 --> 01:10:08,835
(His rap suffocates the others as they watch.)

1959
01:10:09,419 --> 01:10:11,082
- He might end up dying. - I know.

1960
01:10:11,750 --> 01:10:12,871
It might kill him.

1961
01:10:13,389 --> 01:10:14,619
I can do this much.

1962
01:10:14,620 --> 01:10:16,088
- Okay. - What do you think? Is it okay?

1963
01:10:16,089 --> 01:10:17,258
These days,

1964
01:10:17,259 --> 01:10:19,289
hip-hop has changed a lot.

1965
01:10:19,290 --> 01:10:20,959
You shouldn't speak clearly.

1966
01:10:20,960 --> 01:10:22,399
- I see. - Oh, really?

1967
01:10:22,400 --> 01:10:24,228
People used to go, "Hello, I'm Nucksal."

1968
01:10:24,229 --> 01:10:25,668
- But not anymore. - "Hello, I'm Nucksal."

1969
01:10:25,669 --> 01:10:27,598
(A difference between old hip-hop and new hip-hop)

1970
01:10:27,599 --> 01:10:29,783
- Really? - Isn't that a bit too rude?

1971
01:10:29,969 --> 01:10:31,539
- That's... - It's too insincere.

1972
01:10:31,540 --> 01:10:33,814
It's too rude. We shouldn't be like that on TV.

1973
01:10:34,040 --> 01:10:36,325
You've got to record a song within three minutes after you wake up.

1974
01:10:36,809 --> 01:10:38,378
- Are you serious? - When your voice is...

1975
01:10:38,379 --> 01:10:39,848
- I can do a good job with that. - still down.

1976
01:10:39,849 --> 01:10:41,819
- Ji Hyo is confident. - Ji Hyo,

1977
01:10:41,879 --> 01:10:44,649
what you did wasn't bad. It sounded loose.

1978
01:10:44,650 --> 01:10:46,454
- My voice was... - It's trendier.

1979
01:10:46,519 --> 01:10:47,989
(Ji Hyo's rap is a bit trendier.)

1980
01:10:48,290 --> 01:10:49,411
What?

1981
01:10:49,660 --> 01:10:52,029
- I'm telling you. - Are you serious?

1982
01:10:52,030 --> 01:10:54,758
(Ms. 40, aka Trendy Rapper)

1983
01:10:54,759 --> 01:10:56,428
- What she did... - Hey.

1984
01:10:56,429 --> 01:10:58,369
- was trendy? - My style is trendier than yours.

1985
01:10:58,370 --> 01:11:00,869
- This is upsetting. - Sit back down.

1986
01:11:00,870 --> 01:11:03,317
- Sit down. - Her rap is more trendy?

1987
01:11:04,200 --> 01:11:05,975
Maybe I should play this for her.

1988
01:11:06,269 --> 01:11:07,338
Play what?

1989
01:11:07,339 --> 01:11:09,279
I'm playing this for Ji Hyo...

1990
01:11:09,280 --> 01:11:10,840
so that she learns from this person's confidence.

1991
01:11:11,280 --> 01:11:13,493
He fills the song only with sound words.

1992
01:11:14,179 --> 01:11:18,066
(He plays a song for Ji Hyo to regain her confidence.)

1993
01:11:18,750 --> 01:11:20,418
(Rapping)

1994
01:11:20,419 --> 01:11:22,159
(He catches it.)

1995
01:11:22,160 --> 01:11:23,859
(Making sounds)

1996
01:11:23,860 --> 01:11:25,186
You're good.

1997
01:11:26,190 --> 01:11:28,699
(Speaking sound words)

1998
01:11:28,700 --> 01:11:29,780
(Exclaiming)

1999
01:11:32,030 --> 01:11:33,728
What you just did...

2000
01:11:33,729 --> 01:11:35,168
- comes out in the later part. - What?

2001
01:11:35,169 --> 01:11:36,567
Try listening to this.

2002
01:11:36,740 --> 01:11:37,861
There.

2003
01:11:40,469 --> 01:11:42,959
(Woof, woof)

2004
01:11:43,080 --> 01:11:45,808
(Barking)

2005
01:11:45,809 --> 01:11:46,949
How was that?

2006
01:11:46,950 --> 01:11:48,878
(He's indeed a "want-to-be" crazy guy.)

2007
01:11:48,879 --> 01:11:51,649
They rap like this too. And it leads to my point.

2008
01:11:51,650 --> 01:11:54,489
You can pull it off if you have confidence.

2009
01:11:54,490 --> 01:11:55,917
- You heard the last part. - Don't you agree?

2010
01:11:56,160 --> 01:11:58,200
- This is about confidence. - Right.

2011
01:11:58,690 --> 01:11:59,959
Let's try doing it while we're at it.

2012
01:11:59,960 --> 01:12:01,561
Write what you will say here.

2013
01:12:01,599 --> 01:12:02,823
You mean, this?

2014
01:12:03,360 --> 01:12:04,756
- Why not? - We're doing this?

2015
01:12:04,769 --> 01:12:05,851
Let's give it a go.

2016
01:12:06,400 --> 01:12:08,378
This is about confidence. I can do it.

2017
01:12:08,870 --> 01:12:10,604
(Her eyes shake.)

2018
01:12:10,700 --> 01:12:12,607
- I'll write words for you. - Right, right.

2019
01:12:13,769 --> 01:12:14,978
(Nucksal will rap freestyle first, then Ji Hyo will follow.)

2020
01:12:14,979 --> 01:12:16,279
Try rapping.

2021
01:12:16,280 --> 01:12:18,390
(Nucksal will rap freestyle first, then Ji Hyo will follow.)

2022
01:12:19,049 --> 01:12:21,119
(Amazed)

2023
01:12:21,120 --> 01:12:23,079
(Sound words for Ji Hyo are complete too.)

2024
01:12:23,080 --> 01:12:24,273
When do I start?

2025
01:12:24,790 --> 01:12:25,942
Hold on.

2026
01:12:26,549 --> 01:12:28,865
Here it comes. 2, 3, 4.

2027
01:12:28,889 --> 01:12:30,789
- 1, 2, 3, 4. - Now.

2028
01:12:30,790 --> 01:12:32,329
(Giddy-up)

2029
01:12:32,330 --> 01:12:34,128
(Woot, woot)

2030
01:12:34,129 --> 01:12:36,098
(There you go.)

2031
01:12:36,099 --> 01:12:37,833
(Alright)

2032
01:12:38,500 --> 01:12:39,968
(Se Chan takes over.)

2033
01:12:39,969 --> 01:12:41,999
Just say it like this.

2034
01:12:42,000 --> 01:12:43,397
What is that?

2035
01:12:43,599 --> 01:12:45,273
I just wrote random words.

2036
01:12:45,370 --> 01:12:46,868
Don't hesitate.

2037
01:12:46,910 --> 01:12:48,236
What is that?

2038
01:12:48,440 --> 01:12:50,010
It's not bad.

2039
01:12:50,110 --> 01:12:51,149
I know.

2040
01:12:51,150 --> 01:12:53,526
- You can do it too. - Right.

2041
01:12:54,349 --> 01:12:56,319
- He's too hilarious. - Don't worry about backup sounds.

2042
01:12:56,320 --> 01:12:58,119
- You don't have to worry either. - It's good.

2043
01:12:58,120 --> 01:12:59,374
I have 500 of these.

2044
01:13:00,019 --> 01:13:01,213
Various ones.

2045
01:13:01,259 --> 01:13:02,989
- You're an artist. - Don't you worry.

2046
01:13:02,990 --> 01:13:04,284
- I've got it. - That's improvisation.

2047
01:13:04,320 --> 01:13:05,920
Why don't we just record a song now?

2048
01:13:06,259 --> 01:13:08,198
- Let's go with it. - You can do it too, Ji Hyo.

2049
01:13:08,259 --> 01:13:09,688
- Right, everyone can do it. - I'm telling you.

2050
01:13:09,900 --> 01:13:12,480
In my opinion,

2051
01:13:12,729 --> 01:13:14,968
we should include what we just listened to.

2052
01:13:14,969 --> 01:13:18,069
Then I'll make a group chat for us...

2053
01:13:18,070 --> 01:13:20,180
and share three songs with you...

2054
01:13:20,210 --> 01:13:21,539
- including what we just listened. - Let's share songs that way.

2055
01:13:21,540 --> 01:13:23,344
I'm sorry,

2056
01:13:23,379 --> 01:13:25,215
but she can't be in that group chat.

2057
01:13:25,910 --> 01:13:28,123
- You don't have the messenger app? - She doesn't have it.

2058
01:13:28,479 --> 01:13:30,348
- Then... - She's 40.

2059
01:13:30,349 --> 01:13:32,665
(Whispering that she's 40)

2060
01:13:33,519 --> 01:13:35,559
(You little...)

2061
01:13:36,259 --> 01:13:37,544
So it's illegal from the age of 40.

2062
01:13:37,620 --> 01:13:38,659
- Hey. - Right.

2063
01:13:38,660 --> 01:13:40,464
What are you talking about?

2064
01:13:40,490 --> 01:13:43,254
Then we'll record the songs on a tape and hand it to you, Se Chan.

2065
01:13:43,330 --> 01:13:46,084
- You have a cassette player, right? - You've got all these machines.

2066
01:13:46,269 --> 01:13:48,513
- She might use a messenger swallow. - "Swallow".

2067
01:13:48,599 --> 01:13:49,996
That's centuries ago.

2068
01:13:50,099 --> 01:13:51,263
Or a letter.

2069
01:13:51,540 --> 01:13:53,239
- Goodness. - We'll share them with you somehow.

2070
01:13:53,240 --> 01:13:55,321
(Code Kunst's beat will be delivered via cassette tape.)

2071
01:13:56,280 --> 01:13:58,320
- I've been to this studio before. - Oh, really?

2072
01:13:58,410 --> 01:13:59,603
Have a seat here.

2073
01:14:00,080 --> 01:14:01,218
What do we do?

2074
01:14:01,219 --> 01:14:02,478
- Have you been well? - Yes.

2075
01:14:02,479 --> 01:14:04,119
- And you? - Did you write any songs?

2076
01:14:04,120 --> 01:14:05,189
(Asking out of the blue)

2077
01:14:05,190 --> 01:14:06,689
(Flustered)

2078
01:14:06,690 --> 01:14:08,918
- Nothing has been decided yet. - Oh, really?

2079
01:14:08,919 --> 01:14:09,959
Yes, of course.

2080
01:14:09,960 --> 01:14:11,588
Gummy, we have all our trust in you.

2081
01:14:11,589 --> 01:14:12,888
- We're depending on you. - Really?

2082
01:14:12,889 --> 01:14:15,306
I was depending on you guys.

2083
01:14:15,500 --> 01:14:18,387
- I didn't think about anything. - I thought about it,

2084
01:14:18,830 --> 01:14:21,695
and even after giving it a lot of thought,

2085
01:14:22,240 --> 01:14:24,199
I can't think of anything because Haha is in our group.

2086
01:14:24,200 --> 01:14:27,228
(I can't think of anything because Haha is in our group.)

2087
01:14:27,440 --> 01:14:29,579
Me too.

2088
01:14:29,580 --> 01:14:34,579
Honestly, I don't know how I can fit between you two.

2089
01:14:34,580 --> 01:14:36,619
- Honestly, - And it's not like I can sit out.

2090
01:14:36,620 --> 01:14:38,588
things were easier when we had Kwang Soo in our group.

2091
01:14:40,219 --> 01:14:41,619
I agree.

2092
01:14:41,620 --> 01:14:43,659
Things got harder when you joined our team.

2093
01:14:43,660 --> 01:14:44,829
- It's puzzling, isn't it? - Yes.

2094
01:14:44,830 --> 01:14:46,054
- We have different colors. - You have such a distinct voice...

2095
01:14:46,389 --> 01:14:47,899
and color.

2096
01:14:47,900 --> 01:14:50,042
Then maybe you should just leave the song preparation to me.

2097
01:14:50,830 --> 01:14:52,128
Why don't I make it my style?

2098
01:14:52,129 --> 01:14:53,802
- Reggae? - No.

2099
01:14:54,030 --> 01:14:55,798
To be honest,

2100
01:14:55,799 --> 01:14:58,085
since I'm in this group,

2101
01:14:58,339 --> 01:15:01,008
I thought a traditional ballad would be nice.

2102
01:15:01,009 --> 01:15:03,079
But what's important...

2103
01:15:03,080 --> 01:15:05,449
is that I've never heard you sing a ballad before.

2104
01:15:05,450 --> 01:15:07,418
I need to hear you sing...

2105
01:15:07,710 --> 01:15:09,018
- seriously. - But...

2106
01:15:09,019 --> 01:15:12,049
I get shy when I get put on the spot.

2107
01:15:12,290 --> 01:15:13,918
I need to feel comfortable first.

2108
01:15:13,919 --> 01:15:15,758
- Get used to the surroundings? - Yes, and then...

2109
01:15:15,759 --> 01:15:17,799
maybe we can talk about love.

2110
01:15:18,030 --> 01:15:19,763
- What's a good ballad? - Or...

2111
01:15:19,960 --> 01:15:21,159
- maybe a Shin Seung Hun song? - What's something recent?

2112
01:15:21,160 --> 01:15:22,928
- Sure, a Seung Hun song is good. - Those are high.

2113
01:15:22,929 --> 01:15:24,529
What about "Reflection of You in My Smile".

2114
01:15:24,530 --> 01:15:26,263
"Reflection of You in My Smile".

2115
01:15:26,330 --> 01:15:27,899
- Do you have the lyrics? - Yes.

2116
01:15:27,900 --> 01:15:30,598
("Reflection of You in My Smile" by Shin Seung Hun is...)

2117
01:15:30,599 --> 01:15:33,039
(one of the legendary songs in the history of Korean ballads.)

2118
01:15:33,040 --> 01:15:36,239
(It was a debut album that sold over a million copies.)

2119
01:15:36,240 --> 01:15:41,687
(How will a traditional ballad by Haha sound?)

2120
01:15:43,549 --> 01:15:45,848
More than a rose

2121
01:15:45,849 --> 01:15:46,910
Hold on.

2122
01:15:48,160 --> 01:15:50,088
- Hold on. Sorry. - Keep going. You can do it.

2123
01:15:50,089 --> 01:15:51,518
(Don't worry. Keep going.)

2124
01:15:51,790 --> 01:15:52,789
This is good.

2125
01:15:52,790 --> 01:15:54,088
(Continuing on with the song with Gummy's support)

2126
01:15:54,089 --> 01:15:57,428
A fragrant stronger than that

2127
01:15:57,429 --> 01:15:59,469
Seems like your voice isn't that low, either.

2128
01:16:00,599 --> 01:16:05,975
(Haha is surprising everyone with his ballad-singing skills.)

2129
01:16:06,940 --> 01:16:08,062
Don't just throw the note into the air.

2130
01:16:08,809 --> 01:16:11,400
You are warmer than that

2131
01:16:11,610 --> 01:16:14,098
- You're really good. - This is good.

2132
01:16:14,879 --> 01:16:16,918
Why did you do that again?

2133
01:16:16,919 --> 01:16:18,112
Don't do that.

2134
01:16:18,450 --> 01:16:20,289
(Blushing)

2135
01:16:20,290 --> 01:16:22,258
Think of it as projecting thinner sounds.

2136
01:16:22,559 --> 01:16:24,976
(Think of it as projecting thinner sounds.)

2137
01:16:25,330 --> 01:16:27,777
Okay, this is good.

2138
01:16:27,929 --> 01:16:29,928
That's all I need to hear.

2139
01:16:29,929 --> 01:16:33,398
(Running away)

2140
01:16:34,030 --> 01:16:35,699
I can't do this!

2141
01:16:35,700 --> 01:16:36,899
(I can't do this at all!)

2142
01:16:36,900 --> 01:16:39,838
We're good. I see hope.

2143
01:16:39,839 --> 01:16:41,039
- He's... - Let's do a ballad.

2144
01:16:41,040 --> 01:16:44,239
You're just very stubborn...

2145
01:16:44,240 --> 01:16:46,321
- with the syllables you emphasize. - That's right.

2146
01:16:46,580 --> 01:16:48,249
- Let's do a ballad. - This is embarrassing.

2147
01:16:48,250 --> 01:16:49,811
You're really good.

2148
01:16:49,879 --> 01:16:52,236
- Can I be honest? - Sure.

2149
01:16:52,389 --> 01:16:54,970
I was the lead of the alto section in the YMCA choir.

2150
01:16:57,190 --> 01:16:58,720
Alto?

2151
01:16:58,990 --> 01:17:01,509
Since we've all tested me,

2152
01:17:01,629 --> 01:17:03,459
I'm going to test you.

2153
01:17:03,460 --> 01:17:05,298
I know you two are good,

2154
01:17:05,299 --> 01:17:06,758
- but let's hear it. - A duet?

2155
01:17:07,129 --> 01:17:09,968
- Can you do a duet? - I've never done one with a lady.

2156
01:17:09,969 --> 01:17:10,999
Can you do a duet?

2157
01:17:11,000 --> 01:17:12,508
Do you know "Scars Deeper than Love"?

2158
01:17:12,509 --> 01:17:15,079
I know the song.

2159
01:17:15,080 --> 01:17:16,138
Do you know "The Blue in You"?

2160
01:17:16,139 --> 01:17:17,779
- I need to see the lyrics. - That's fine.

2161
01:17:17,780 --> 01:17:19,789
You can read the lyrics as you go. You can sit here.

2162
01:17:20,049 --> 01:17:21,752
This is such an honor.

2163
01:17:21,919 --> 01:17:23,819
- I've never done this, but... - This is such an honor.

2164
01:17:23,820 --> 01:17:26,471
- This is incredible. - Let's do a song that you know.

2165
01:17:26,549 --> 01:17:30,701
(How will the best ballad artists of Korea sound together?)

2166
01:17:34,389 --> 01:17:35,756
Maybe we should've just met up at a karaoke place.

2167
01:17:36,259 --> 01:17:41,431
I close my eyes

2168
01:17:41,940 --> 01:17:47,110
The light and the sight of you are fading away

2169
01:17:47,910 --> 01:17:49,847
Now in the darkness

2170
01:17:49,910 --> 01:17:55,693
(The queen of RnB is ringing through everyone's souls.)

2171
01:17:56,049 --> 01:18:00,986
In the deep blue

2172
01:18:01,419 --> 01:18:07,142
Why are you slipping away

2173
01:18:07,690 --> 01:18:10,484
The world

2174
01:18:11,500 --> 01:18:17,762
Is still standing by you

2175
01:18:19,070 --> 01:18:25,434
- Although it is not love - Although it is not love

2176
01:18:25,509 --> 01:18:29,630
- When we met - When we met

2177
01:18:29,879 --> 01:18:34,173
- It lifted the darkness - It lifted the darkness

2178
01:18:35,290 --> 01:18:40,989
(The perfect harmonies make it hard to believe that this is an improv.)

2179
01:18:40,990 --> 01:18:46,885
(This is how an improvised duet of the two best ballad singers sound.)

2180
01:18:46,900 --> 01:18:54,897
- The sight of you in my eyes - In my eyes

2181
01:18:55,639 --> 01:18:58,649
(Harmony that heals your soul)

2182
01:18:58,650 --> 01:19:01,097
There's no way this is the first time you sang together.

2183
01:19:01,950 --> 01:19:03,408
You definitely met up last week.

2184
01:19:03,849 --> 01:19:05,145
That's incredible.

2185
01:19:05,450 --> 01:19:08,048
- You're being too nice. - There's no place for me here.

2186
01:19:08,049 --> 01:19:10,888
No, why don't we try singing this together, the two of us?

2187
01:19:10,889 --> 01:19:12,726
(Try singing the song with me.)

2188
01:19:13,389 --> 01:19:15,399
Come on.

2189
01:19:15,400 --> 01:19:17,573
- It's going to sound funny. - Not at all.

2190
01:19:17,900 --> 01:19:22,428
(How will the reggae kid and the queen of ballad sound together?)

2191
01:19:23,040 --> 01:19:28,709
I'm dreaming

2192
01:19:28,710 --> 01:19:33,911
My time with you has stopped

2193
01:19:34,950 --> 01:19:37,279
(It's almost Haha's time to sing.)

2194
01:19:37,280 --> 01:19:38,348
This is crazy.

2195
01:19:38,349 --> 01:19:40,052
(It's almost Haha's time to sing.)

2196
01:19:42,860 --> 01:19:45,950
(Rain)

2197
01:19:48,059 --> 01:19:49,998
(You're doing fine.)

2198
01:19:51,129 --> 01:19:54,569
(He's trying to sing as gently as possible.)

2199
01:19:54,570 --> 01:19:55,638
- That's good. - That's it.

2200
01:19:55,639 --> 01:19:58,047
Let's sing all together. Jong Kook, sing in unison with Haha.

2201
01:19:58,540 --> 01:20:01,294
(Although it isn't love)

2202
01:20:03,139 --> 01:20:04,838
You can lower the octave if it's too high for you.

2203
01:20:04,839 --> 01:20:08,318
(When we met)

2204
01:20:09,820 --> 01:20:14,174
(They sound much more stable, thanks to Gummy's advice.)

2205
01:20:16,759 --> 01:20:21,349
(Their different voices actually sound great together.)

2206
01:20:26,070 --> 01:20:32,638
The sight of me in your eyes

2207
01:20:34,070 --> 01:20:39,384
The sight of you

2208
01:20:41,280 --> 01:20:46,043
- In my eyes - In my eyes

2209
01:20:51,190 --> 01:20:52,859
(Team Gummy has a very unique blend of voices.)

2210
01:20:52,860 --> 01:20:54,359
That's awesome.

2211
01:20:54,389 --> 01:20:56,529
(Team Gummy has a very unique blend of voices.)

2212
01:20:56,530 --> 01:20:58,437
I know I sang it, but that was absolutely beautiful.

2213
01:20:59,500 --> 01:21:00,668
I got goosebumps.

2214
01:21:00,669 --> 01:21:02,811
Honestly, that was just too beautiful.

2215
01:21:03,639 --> 01:21:05,342
This was my first time singing in harmony since YMCA.

2216
01:21:06,240 --> 01:21:08,878
- First time harmonizing. - You are singing an octave lower...

2217
01:21:08,879 --> 01:21:11,138
but still in unison with us...

2218
01:21:11,139 --> 01:21:12,449
- that made it sound perfect. - I liked it too.

2219
01:21:12,450 --> 01:21:14,653
- Right? - Let's settle with a ballad.

2220
01:21:14,809 --> 01:21:17,749
Let's take some time to decide whether we'll go traditional...

2221
01:21:17,750 --> 01:21:20,341
- or something different. - This is incredible.

2222
01:21:21,320 --> 01:21:22,584
This is unbelievable.

2223
01:21:23,790 --> 01:21:26,588
(They're locked inside a building deep inside the mountains?)

2224
01:21:26,589 --> 01:21:29,829
(The members are locked inside a building.)

2225
01:21:29,830 --> 01:21:32,369
(The only hope is the five exits.)

2226
01:21:32,370 --> 01:21:33,899
(Another escapee, Cho Jung Seok, is here.)

2227
01:21:33,900 --> 01:21:35,704
(A charming lady, Yoon A)

2228
01:21:36,099 --> 01:21:38,762
(Right then, as soon as someone opened the first exit,)

2229
01:21:38,839 --> 01:21:42,175
(the other exits began disappearing.)

2230
01:21:42,240 --> 01:21:46,054
(In a mess of mysterious things being spotted one by one,)

2231
01:21:46,150 --> 01:21:48,833
(will the members be able to escape safely?)

2232
01:21:49,320 --> 01:21:50,619
There must be something else.

2233
01:21:50,620 --> 01:21:52,833
(Five Exits: Escape to Live)
