1
00:00:05,506 --> 00:00:07,015
- Hello. - Hi.

2
00:00:07,016 --> 00:00:08,475
- Hi. - Hello.

3
00:00:08,476 --> 00:00:10,175
- This place is beautiful. - Hello.

4
00:00:10,176 --> 00:00:12,184
- This is such a beautiful place. - Okay!

5
00:00:12,185 --> 00:00:13,205
Good morning.

6
00:00:13,656 --> 00:00:16,655
Kwang Soo, you shouldn't wear your pajama pants to the filming.

7
00:00:16,656 --> 00:00:18,955
No. They aren't pajama pants.

8
00:00:18,956 --> 00:00:20,795
I get that you feel comfortable, but you shouldn't wear those.

9
00:00:20,796 --> 00:00:22,795
- They aren't pajama pants. - Hey, what is that?

10
00:00:22,796 --> 00:00:25,141
- Right here... - What's crawling on your pants?

11
00:00:25,325 --> 00:00:28,435
Jong Kook wouldn't have allowed this if this happened back in the days.

12
00:00:28,436 --> 00:00:29,734
- That's right, I wouldn't have. - You know?

13
00:00:29,735 --> 00:00:32,388
These aren't pajama pants. We weren't even in our spots yet!

14
00:00:33,135 --> 00:00:34,575
- They aren't pajama pants. - You just rolled out of bed.

15
00:00:34,576 --> 00:00:36,304
- No, no. - Why did you wear that?

16
00:00:36,305 --> 00:00:38,794
By the way, why are you wearing sunglasses now?

17
00:00:39,245 --> 00:00:40,775
Your eyes are pretty, you know.

18
00:00:42,216 --> 00:00:44,115
(Take off your sunglasses.)

19
00:00:44,116 --> 00:00:47,155
Seok Jin. What was that?

20
00:00:47,156 --> 00:00:48,890
(It was a compliment.)

21
00:00:49,156 --> 00:00:51,225
Here's what really happened. After talking about her sunglasses,

22
00:00:51,226 --> 00:00:53,424
- Ji Hyo didn't look happy. - he saw she wasn't happy about it.

23
00:00:53,425 --> 00:00:55,424
- He saw that she wasn't happy. - Seok Jin.

24
00:00:55,425 --> 00:00:56,694
- Seok Jin. - He catches on really fast.

25
00:00:56,695 --> 00:00:58,164
Your eyes are awful, you know.

26
00:00:58,165 --> 00:01:00,267
He threw the carrot as soon as he gave her stick.

27
00:01:00,595 --> 00:01:02,795
- He's not good at improvising. - Exactly.

28
00:01:02,796 --> 00:01:04,435
He can think on his feet now.

29
00:01:04,436 --> 00:01:06,534
I'm really good at improvising.

30
00:01:06,535 --> 00:01:08,435
I bet he can do this because of his wife.

31
00:01:08,436 --> 00:01:09,834
- My gosh. - Right.

32
00:01:09,835 --> 00:01:12,344
"What are you doing, honey? Honey, this is beautiful."

33
00:01:12,345 --> 00:01:14,945
He says these lines to survive.

34
00:01:14,946 --> 00:01:16,644
Let me tell you a story about my wife.

35
00:01:16,645 --> 00:01:20,114
Yesterday, she gave me some food. It was fried tofu rice balls.

36
00:01:20,115 --> 00:01:23,484
I asked if we had... I saw the fried tofu a long time ago.

37
00:01:23,485 --> 00:01:24,811
I asked if it was old fried tofu.

38
00:01:24,826 --> 00:01:27,695
She said, "Just eat it. You're the oldest thing in our house."

39
00:01:27,696 --> 00:01:29,424
(Just eat it. You're the oldest thing in our house.)

40
00:01:29,425 --> 00:01:32,424
(He's the oldest person and thing.)

41
00:01:33,196 --> 00:01:35,165
(His wife's line struck hard at the picky eater.)

42
00:01:35,166 --> 00:01:36,834
- My gosh, his wife... - Goodness.

43
00:01:36,835 --> 00:01:39,605
- She's the best. - Her improvisation is much better.

44
00:01:39,606 --> 00:01:41,734
- It was awesome. - The family of improvisation.

45
00:01:41,735 --> 00:01:44,445
I was so wounded inside. I couldn't say anything.

46
00:01:44,446 --> 00:01:45,474
(That's true.)

47
00:01:45,475 --> 00:01:46,545
I couldn't say anything.

48
00:01:46,546 --> 00:01:49,474
- She has a similar sense of humor. - That was amazing.

49
00:01:49,475 --> 00:01:51,761
That was great.

50
00:01:52,246 --> 00:01:54,555
- Are you curious about the race? - Yes.

51
00:01:54,556 --> 00:01:56,784
Before I tell you about your mission today,

52
00:01:56,785 --> 00:01:58,325
- you'll welcome guests today. - I see.

53
00:01:58,326 --> 00:02:00,355
- They will come through the door. - It's been a while.

54
00:02:00,356 --> 00:02:01,355
It's been a while.

55
00:02:01,356 --> 00:02:02,855
Please come on out.

56
00:02:03,326 --> 00:02:04,325
- Who is it? - This is...

57
00:02:04,326 --> 00:02:05,651
(Today's guests came all the way here in this heatwave.)

58
00:02:06,026 --> 00:02:07,734
- It's a concert hall. - It's been a long time.

59
00:02:07,735 --> 00:02:09,535
(Cho Jung Seok, the ideal handsome guy)

60
00:02:09,536 --> 00:02:11,334
(Yoon A, perfect idol singer and actress)

61
00:02:11,335 --> 00:02:12,464
(These two familiar guests are visiting Running Man today.)

62
00:02:12,465 --> 00:02:14,434
- Jung Seok. - It's Yoon A.

63
00:02:14,435 --> 00:02:15,834
- My goodness. - Jung Seok.

64
00:02:15,835 --> 00:02:18,345
- Jung Seok. - Jung Seok. My brother-in-law.

65
00:02:18,346 --> 00:02:20,345
- What do we call him? - What's going on?

66
00:02:20,346 --> 00:02:22,345
- Call him brother. - Brother.

67
00:02:22,346 --> 00:02:24,590
- Brother. My goodness. - Gosh.

68
00:02:24,916 --> 00:02:26,285
- Brother. - Hello.

69
00:02:26,286 --> 00:02:27,714
- Have you been well? - Yoon A.

70
00:02:27,715 --> 00:02:29,592
- Have you been well? - Hello.

71
00:02:29,615 --> 00:02:31,225
- Hi. - Hello, Yoon A.

72
00:02:31,226 --> 00:02:32,725
- Hey, it's been a while. - Yes, it's been so long.

73
00:02:32,726 --> 00:02:34,954
- Hello. - I'm happy to see Jung Seok,

74
00:02:34,955 --> 00:02:37,265
- but now that we filmed with her, - Right. We filmed...

75
00:02:37,266 --> 00:02:38,795
- with Gummy. - I'm happy to see you even more.

76
00:02:38,796 --> 00:02:41,165
- I heard the news. - We wanted to invite you out.

77
00:02:41,166 --> 00:02:44,005
A while ago, Gummy was on Running Man.

78
00:02:44,006 --> 00:02:45,434
- She filmed an episode with us. - Yes.

79
00:02:45,435 --> 00:02:47,005
Did she say anything about her experience?

80
00:02:47,006 --> 00:02:49,035
Well, she... Can I be honest?

81
00:02:49,036 --> 00:02:50,644
- Yes, be honest. - Okay.

82
00:02:50,645 --> 00:02:54,174
I was driving and brought up the show.

83
00:02:54,175 --> 00:02:56,053
I told her that she had the dream team.

84
00:02:56,215 --> 00:02:58,484
I said that if Jong Kook and she could sing...

85
00:02:58,485 --> 00:03:01,311
and Haha could rap, it would be awesome.

86
00:03:01,386 --> 00:03:02,654
This is what she said.

87
00:03:02,655 --> 00:03:03,654
(This is Gummy's answer to that.)

88
00:03:03,655 --> 00:03:05,255
(Shaking her head)

89
00:03:05,256 --> 00:03:07,125
Haha wants to sing.

90
00:03:07,126 --> 00:03:08,553
(Haha wants to sing.)

91
00:03:09,096 --> 00:03:12,195
(Haha's unyielding persistence wasn't what she expected.)

92
00:03:12,196 --> 00:03:14,095
That punk. Goodness, he should know his place.

93
00:03:14,096 --> 00:03:16,535
- My gosh. - You don't know your place.

94
00:03:16,536 --> 00:03:18,065
- There was a talk about that. - She looked different.

95
00:03:18,066 --> 00:03:19,265
You don't know your place.

96
00:03:19,266 --> 00:03:22,334
Sorry to say this but after she said that,

97
00:03:22,335 --> 00:03:24,111
our conversation ended there.

98
00:03:24,745 --> 00:03:26,045
She didn't say anything.

99
00:03:26,046 --> 00:03:27,677
- Haha, you should leave the team. - She didn't say anything.

100
00:03:27,816 --> 00:03:29,274
- Go to another team. - No.

101
00:03:29,275 --> 00:03:32,479
You only mentioned Haha, and things got bad in the car.

102
00:03:32,745 --> 00:03:34,285
Gosh, this is unbelievable.

103
00:03:34,286 --> 00:03:37,225
- I'll sing more passionately then. - She sighed.

104
00:03:37,226 --> 00:03:39,184
By the way, you two...

105
00:03:39,185 --> 00:03:41,195
filmed a movie together, right?

106
00:03:41,196 --> 00:03:42,195
- A movie? - I see.

107
00:03:42,196 --> 00:03:43,625
- Really? - What's the movie about?

108
00:03:43,626 --> 00:03:45,964
- It's called "Exit". - "Exit".

109
00:03:45,965 --> 00:03:48,108
- "Exit". - It's about escaping a disaster.

110
00:03:48,796 --> 00:03:51,213
Movies about disasters are entertaining.

111
00:03:51,835 --> 00:03:54,635
Isn't this your first time working together on a project?

112
00:03:54,636 --> 00:03:55,635
- Yes. - Yes.

113
00:03:55,636 --> 00:03:57,105
How was working with one another?

114
00:03:57,106 --> 00:03:58,644
- I... - It was great.

115
00:03:58,645 --> 00:04:00,204
Come on.

116
00:04:00,205 --> 00:04:02,389
(She didn't even breathe before answering.)

117
00:04:02,745 --> 00:04:04,445
- You didn't sound sincere at all. - No.

118
00:04:04,446 --> 00:04:06,345
- Don't say what you memorized. - Come on.

119
00:04:06,346 --> 00:04:07,915
- You're unbelievable. - Stop teasing me!

120
00:04:07,916 --> 00:04:10,755
- You didn't sound sincere. - Yoon A has gotten weird.

121
00:04:10,756 --> 00:04:12,084
- What was that? - Come on.

122
00:04:12,085 --> 00:04:15,325
Besides, what was this just now? She screamed like this.

123
00:04:15,326 --> 00:04:17,055
- What was that? - Come on.

124
00:04:17,056 --> 00:04:18,195
(She still answers like an idol singer.)

125
00:04:18,196 --> 00:04:21,534
Anyway, Yoon A and Jung Seok will be joining us...

126
00:04:21,535 --> 00:04:23,034
for today's episode.

127
00:04:23,035 --> 00:04:25,107
- Let's give them a hand. - Yes!

128
00:04:26,705 --> 00:04:29,034
Today, it'll be an individual match. It's ECN for short.

129
00:04:29,035 --> 00:04:30,305
Escape with Cards,

130
00:04:30,306 --> 00:04:32,344
- Then It'll Be Nice. - We have to escape.

131
00:04:32,345 --> 00:04:34,844
Today, you'll be locked inside the building.

132
00:04:34,845 --> 00:04:36,344
(An unexpected warning)

133
00:04:36,345 --> 00:04:38,914
(They will get locked up from the start?)

134
00:04:38,915 --> 00:04:41,214
(The moment they enter the building,)

135
00:04:41,215 --> 00:04:43,021
(all the exits will be closed.)

136
00:04:43,186 --> 00:04:45,584
Let me tell you how you can escape.

137
00:04:45,585 --> 00:04:48,425
The race will begin with three cards.

138
00:04:48,426 --> 00:04:50,190
You'll draw those cards shortly.

139
00:04:50,725 --> 00:04:52,524
Throughout the building,

140
00:04:52,525 --> 00:04:55,464
there are five exits where you can escape the building from.

141
00:04:55,465 --> 00:04:56,464
There are only five.

142
00:04:56,465 --> 00:04:58,334
Each exit has a different condition...

143
00:04:58,335 --> 00:04:59,735
- you must meet to escape. - Is that so?

144
00:04:59,736 --> 00:05:02,075
If you think you meet the condition of the exit,

145
00:05:02,076 --> 00:05:03,945
you can escape at any time.

146
00:05:03,946 --> 00:05:05,245
- Together? - Is that it then?

147
00:05:05,246 --> 00:05:09,075
If a member escapes through the exit, the exit will be closed.

148
00:05:09,076 --> 00:05:10,644
That means only five of us can make it out.

149
00:05:10,645 --> 00:05:13,344
That's correct. The condition for 1 of the 4 exits is...

150
00:05:13,345 --> 00:05:15,985
the member with the biggest sum of the three cards.

151
00:05:15,986 --> 00:05:17,724
It's the member with the biggest sum of the three cards.

152
00:05:17,725 --> 00:05:18,745
(The member with the biggest sum of the cards)

153
00:05:19,126 --> 00:05:21,625
And the member with three consecutive numbers.

154
00:05:21,626 --> 00:05:24,277
(The member with three consecutive numbers)

155
00:05:24,566 --> 00:05:26,964
And the member with 3 multiples of 5.

156
00:05:26,965 --> 00:05:29,382
(The member with 3 multiples of 5)

157
00:05:29,436 --> 00:05:32,404
And the member with 4 of the same number from the 3 cards.

158
00:05:32,405 --> 00:05:34,675
For example, if someone has 1, 11, and 21,

159
00:05:34,676 --> 00:05:36,104
that means that person has 4 1s.

160
00:05:36,176 --> 00:05:38,420
These members can escape through these four exits.

161
00:05:39,176 --> 00:05:41,274
The members who successfully escape from the building...

162
00:05:41,275 --> 00:05:42,704
will enter Good Place.

163
00:05:43,016 --> 00:05:44,209
"Good Place".

164
00:05:44,686 --> 00:05:45,945
It's quite self-explanatory.

165
00:05:45,946 --> 00:05:49,584
You can enjoy all the privileges on the menu as much as you want.

166
00:05:49,585 --> 00:05:50,755
(Various services and meals are unlimited.)

167
00:05:50,756 --> 00:05:52,153
(When they escape, they can enjoy the luxury of the place.)

168
00:05:52,225 --> 00:05:53,825
My gosh, I want the massage.

169
00:05:53,826 --> 00:05:54,954
You can get your eyes massaged.

170
00:05:54,955 --> 00:05:57,475
Gosh, there's tiramisu too. There's a lot on the menu.

171
00:05:57,525 --> 00:05:58,724
The scalp treatment is 100 dollars.

172
00:05:58,725 --> 00:06:00,500
- I have to get that. - Okay. I'm in.

173
00:06:00,566 --> 00:06:03,626
The members who failed to escape and members who get eliminated...

174
00:06:03,895 --> 00:06:07,068
will have to pay the tab at Good Place together.

175
00:06:07,405 --> 00:06:08,731
- My gosh. - We have to pay.

176
00:06:09,105 --> 00:06:10,360
We have to pay for it.

177
00:06:10,506 --> 00:06:12,844
The losing members will have to split the tab and pay.

178
00:06:12,845 --> 00:06:14,175
(That will be a lot of money.)

179
00:06:14,176 --> 00:06:15,297
However,

180
00:06:16,176 --> 00:06:19,414
I told you that there are only five exits you can escape from.

181
00:06:19,415 --> 00:06:20,986
I've explained to you about only four exits.

182
00:06:21,016 --> 00:06:22,484
Let me tell you about the last exit.

183
00:06:22,516 --> 00:06:24,524
- The last exit is... - What is it?

184
00:06:24,525 --> 00:06:25,685
the Hunter's door.

185
00:06:25,686 --> 00:06:27,665
(The 5th exit is the Hunter's door.)

186
00:06:27,955 --> 00:06:30,555
(The Hunter's door is somewhere in the basement.)

187
00:06:30,556 --> 00:06:32,964
- There must be a Hunter. - Among 10 of you,

188
00:06:32,965 --> 00:06:35,076
two of you are Hunters.

189
00:06:36,465 --> 00:06:38,604
(The two Hunters, who already got the mission, are among them.)

190
00:06:38,605 --> 00:06:40,164
- Come on. Kwang Soo. - Who are they?

191
00:06:40,165 --> 00:06:41,736
I knew that it was you by the pajama pants.

192
00:06:42,275 --> 00:06:44,445
- You still must be sleepy. - These aren't pajama pants.

193
00:06:44,446 --> 00:06:45,905
- I'm totally awake. - One of them is the Hunter.

194
00:06:46,045 --> 00:06:48,175
- One of them has to be the Hunter. - It's either Yoon A or Jung Seok.

195
00:06:48,176 --> 00:06:49,196
- One of them is the Hunter. - This is crazy.

196
00:06:49,345 --> 00:06:51,284
- One of them must be the Hunter. - Definitely.

197
00:06:51,285 --> 00:06:54,651
You will find three lights in front of the Hunter's door.

198
00:06:54,955 --> 00:06:58,015
When the Hunters complete the secret missions during the race,

199
00:06:58,256 --> 00:06:59,816
the lights will come on one at a time.

200
00:07:00,025 --> 00:07:01,594
And when all three lights are turned on,

201
00:07:01,595 --> 00:07:03,755
the Hunters can escape through the Door.

202
00:07:03,756 --> 00:07:04,925
(They must complete 3 secret missions.)

203
00:07:04,926 --> 00:07:07,164
The moment Hunters escape, the race will end.

204
00:07:07,165 --> 00:07:10,021
And the members who failed to escape will face the penalty.

205
00:07:10,335 --> 00:07:12,365
Hunters? I see. We need to stop them from getting out.

206
00:07:12,366 --> 00:07:13,435
However,

207
00:07:13,436 --> 00:07:16,375
the Hunters can only complete hidden missions when they obtain...

208
00:07:16,376 --> 00:07:18,588
specific numbers the staff selected randomly.

209
00:07:18,946 --> 00:07:22,745
The Hunters have already chosen 3 missions out of the10.

210
00:07:22,746 --> 00:07:25,163
I will give you this list.

211
00:07:25,246 --> 00:07:27,985
Remember these missions when you observe other members later.

212
00:07:27,986 --> 00:07:30,055
You'll let us know what the missions are in advance?

213
00:07:30,056 --> 00:07:31,854
- What is that? - Out of these missions,

214
00:07:31,855 --> 00:07:32,925
- You'll show us the missions? - there are three.

215
00:07:32,926 --> 00:07:34,495
- Secret missions. - "Order and eat jjajangmyeon."

216
00:07:34,496 --> 00:07:37,154
- "Take someone's drink and burp." - "10-second eye contact".

217
00:07:37,155 --> 00:07:39,511
- "Get furiously mad." - They chose 3 of these 10 missions.

218
00:07:39,525 --> 00:07:40,834
- They did? - They were randomly chosen.

219
00:07:40,835 --> 00:07:42,135
- They were random. - "Steal someone's..."

220
00:07:42,136 --> 00:07:43,565
"Do the signature dance of the song, 'Gee'." That's too much.

221
00:07:43,566 --> 00:07:45,370
"Put your hand on someone's shoulder for over five seconds."

222
00:07:46,465 --> 00:07:48,075
- Did you start, Seok Jin? - No, no.

223
00:07:48,076 --> 00:07:49,875
- Wait, but you just did. - No, no.

224
00:07:49,876 --> 00:07:51,375
- He just started the mission. - I was just trying it out.

225
00:07:51,376 --> 00:07:52,945
- Hold on. He started. - He did.

226
00:07:52,946 --> 00:07:54,315
I was just trying it out.

227
00:07:54,316 --> 00:07:56,375
- He just did the mission. - I didn't!

228
00:07:56,376 --> 00:07:57,745
- "Get furiously mad." - "Get furiously mad."

229
00:07:57,746 --> 00:07:58,885
He just did that.

230
00:07:58,886 --> 00:08:01,414
(It's obvious that he's furiously mad.)

231
00:08:01,415 --> 00:08:03,015
- No. - What was that?

232
00:08:03,016 --> 00:08:04,892
- He just did the mission. - You want to finish them now?

233
00:08:04,955 --> 00:08:06,454
Wait, "Change into different pants."

234
00:08:06,455 --> 00:08:08,770
- Didn't Kwang Soo already do that? - No, I didn't.

235
00:08:09,025 --> 00:08:10,219
I didn't change.

236
00:08:11,266 --> 00:08:13,612
Anyway, the missions were chosen randomly.

237
00:08:13,766 --> 00:08:15,876
- Two Hunters chose them randomly. - They were randomly chosen.

238
00:08:17,936 --> 00:08:18,964
- What's that? - What?

239
00:08:18,965 --> 00:08:20,305
I see. The cards are here.

240
00:08:20,306 --> 00:08:22,534
I see. We have to draw the cards here.

241
00:08:22,535 --> 00:08:24,107
We can't show the cards, right?

242
00:08:24,176 --> 00:08:25,368
Right.

243
00:08:25,905 --> 00:08:27,675
I'm sure there will be hints for us...

244
00:08:27,676 --> 00:08:29,774
to figure out what kind of cards other people have, right?

245
00:08:29,775 --> 00:08:31,815
But where are Jae Seok and Yoon A?

246
00:08:31,816 --> 00:08:32,968
Are they the Hunters?

247
00:08:33,086 --> 00:08:34,955
- Isn't that too obvious? - It must be those two.

248
00:08:34,956 --> 00:08:36,855
- Are they getting the missions now? - It could be Yoon A.

249
00:08:36,856 --> 00:08:38,824
- They are late. - I bet they'll come together.

250
00:08:38,825 --> 00:08:39,985
There's a reason for being late.

251
00:08:39,986 --> 00:08:41,524
- Did you get the missions or what? - Did you get the missions?

252
00:08:41,525 --> 00:08:43,125
- Okay. - He's acting.

253
00:08:43,126 --> 00:08:44,495
- Okay. - We'll play along.

254
00:08:44,496 --> 00:08:45,751
It's about time you do a special episode.

255
00:08:47,295 --> 00:08:48,434
Oh, boy.

256
00:08:48,435 --> 00:08:50,098
(Oh, boy.)

257
00:08:50,905 --> 00:08:52,705
"Oh, boy"? Okay.

258
00:08:52,706 --> 00:08:54,304
It's been so long I heard someone say that.

259
00:08:54,305 --> 00:08:56,135
That usually comes up in books, you know?

260
00:08:56,136 --> 00:08:57,434
- Oh, boy. - "Oh, dear."

261
00:08:57,435 --> 00:08:59,205
- Oh, dear. Oh, boy. - Oh, dear.

262
00:08:59,206 --> 00:09:00,444
- Yoon A. - Yoon A.

263
00:09:00,445 --> 00:09:01,741
Did you understand the missions?

264
00:09:01,976 --> 00:09:03,301
- You're not confused anymore. - What?

265
00:09:03,346 --> 00:09:04,885
- Okay. - It's better with explanations.

266
00:09:04,886 --> 00:09:06,715
(Do they really have secret missions?)

267
00:09:06,716 --> 00:09:09,284
Draw one card, show it to them, and put it on your back.

268
00:09:09,285 --> 00:09:13,154
(Jong Kook's back number is 5.)

269
00:09:13,155 --> 00:09:15,645
(His back number is 5. And his numbers are 21 and 32.)

270
00:09:15,795 --> 00:09:18,694
(All 10 of them drew 3 cards.)

271
00:09:18,695 --> 00:09:19,848
All right, everyone.

272
00:09:19,925 --> 00:09:21,832
We'll choose the number for the Hunters now.

273
00:09:22,466 --> 00:09:24,564
The Hunters can complete their missions...

274
00:09:24,565 --> 00:09:25,965
only when they have this number.

275
00:09:25,966 --> 00:09:27,105
(The Hunters can start the mission when they have the number.)

276
00:09:27,106 --> 00:09:28,534
We will randomly draw this number.

277
00:09:28,535 --> 00:09:30,235
If the Hunters have this number, they can start.

278
00:09:30,236 --> 00:09:32,404
If they don't have the number, they must do their best to get it...

279
00:09:32,405 --> 00:09:33,404
for their mission,

280
00:09:33,405 --> 00:09:35,415
- so you must win the games. - Look for who wants to get this.

281
00:09:35,675 --> 00:09:36,767
I'll draw the number now.

282
00:09:37,275 --> 00:09:40,712
(However, only the Hunters will know this number via text message.)

283
00:09:41,155 --> 00:09:43,023
All right. This is the number.

284
00:09:43,086 --> 00:09:45,737
(The number in the tens place won't be revealed.)

285
00:09:45,825 --> 00:09:49,024
(If the Hunters have this number, they can start right away.)

286
00:09:49,025 --> 00:09:53,177
(They have number cards which have 3 in the tens place.)

287
00:09:53,525 --> 00:09:56,350
I will send the Hunters this number through text messages.

288
00:09:56,395 --> 00:09:59,465
If the Hunters have this number, they can start right away.

289
00:09:59,466 --> 00:10:01,954
- But if they don't have it... - I see. The number he just drew...

290
00:10:01,976 --> 00:10:04,034
If they try to do the missions, it means they already have it.

291
00:10:04,035 --> 00:10:05,304
For example, something like this.

292
00:10:05,305 --> 00:10:06,845
- Did you start? - No, no.

293
00:10:06,846 --> 00:10:08,579
- I was giving you an example. - Did you just start?

294
00:10:08,716 --> 00:10:09,767
Hey.

295
00:10:10,145 --> 00:10:12,491
You've never put your hand on my shoulder.

296
00:10:12,886 --> 00:10:14,215
My gosh, he put his hand on my shoulder.

297
00:10:14,216 --> 00:10:15,337
(Getting close)

298
00:10:15,586 --> 00:10:16,707
What are you looking at?

299
00:10:17,055 --> 00:10:18,255
What happened?

300
00:10:18,256 --> 00:10:20,324
(Jae Seok stares at him without trying to hide it.)

301
00:10:20,325 --> 00:10:22,805
(Have eye contact with a member for longer than 10 seconds.)

302
00:10:22,856 --> 00:10:24,024
(What do you take me for?)

303
00:10:24,025 --> 00:10:25,125
Why are you staring at me?

304
00:10:25,126 --> 00:10:27,024
- Jae Seok surprised me. - How dare you stare at me?

305
00:10:27,025 --> 00:10:28,095
(I can stare at whomever I want.)

306
00:10:28,096 --> 00:10:30,104
- How dare you stare at me? - He wants to do it for 10 seconds.

307
00:10:30,295 --> 00:10:31,795
- He wants to do it for 10 seconds. - 1, 2...

308
00:10:32,236 --> 00:10:34,304
(I want to do that too. Counting...)

309
00:10:34,305 --> 00:10:36,173
- Stop it! - 5, 6, 7...

310
00:10:36,606 --> 00:10:37,901
- I didn't look at him. - I think it's him.

311
00:10:38,175 --> 00:10:39,400
Why is your face so red?

312
00:10:40,775 --> 00:10:42,245
I didn't stare at him. I didn't.

313
00:10:42,376 --> 00:10:44,283
All right. As for your first mission,

314
00:10:44,415 --> 00:10:47,015
you will divide into 2 teams of 5.

315
00:10:47,016 --> 00:10:49,855
The first place member of each team will get to switch cards.

316
00:10:49,856 --> 00:10:51,885
(It means selection of the teams is very important.)

317
00:10:51,886 --> 00:10:53,524
I have to get the Exchange Card.

318
00:10:53,525 --> 00:10:56,106
Since the members of your team will play an important role,

319
00:10:56,126 --> 00:10:58,125
the winner of a preliminary mission...

320
00:10:58,126 --> 00:11:00,338
will have a chance to choose his or her team.

321
00:11:00,895 --> 00:11:02,965
Everyone is beatable except for Jong Kook.

322
00:11:02,966 --> 00:11:04,189
They are about the same.

323
00:11:04,905 --> 00:11:06,735
The preliminary mission is an upgraded version of Race of Wits.

324
00:11:06,736 --> 00:11:08,505
It's Upgraded Race of Witty Answers.

325
00:11:08,506 --> 00:11:09,774
- What's that? - Race of Witty Answers?

326
00:11:09,775 --> 00:11:11,674
You will listen to the question provided by the staff.

327
00:11:11,675 --> 00:11:13,245
And whoever gets up first will answer...

328
00:11:13,246 --> 00:11:14,715
the question in two syllables.

329
00:11:14,716 --> 00:11:16,816
If you can ask a question in five seconds, it means you've passed.

330
00:11:16,915 --> 00:11:19,085
The next person will answer in three syllables and ask a question.

331
00:11:19,086 --> 00:11:20,715
And the next person will answer in four syllables.

332
00:11:20,716 --> 00:11:22,314
- It's got upgraded again. - And you can ask a question then.

333
00:11:22,315 --> 00:11:24,054
- We have to ask questions? - You must answer and ask.

334
00:11:24,055 --> 00:11:25,284
(If two people answer at the same time,)

335
00:11:25,285 --> 00:11:26,485
(or if they fail to ask a question in 5 seconds, they lose.)

336
00:11:26,486 --> 00:11:28,159
Even this short game is hard.

337
00:11:29,055 --> 00:11:31,024
(Since it's their first time, it might be hard.)

338
00:11:31,025 --> 00:11:32,861
- Okay. - All right. Here we go.

339
00:11:32,925 --> 00:11:35,064
You'll learn as you play Upgraded Race of Witty Answers.

340
00:11:35,065 --> 00:11:36,525
- This is hard. - Here we go.

341
00:11:37,565 --> 00:11:38,962
Go.

342
00:11:39,136 --> 00:11:41,735
What term of endearment do you call your significant other with?

343
00:11:41,736 --> 00:11:42,774
Honey.

344
00:11:42,775 --> 00:11:45,223
(Two syllables)

345
00:11:46,075 --> 00:11:47,197
You must ask a question right away.

346
00:11:47,305 --> 00:11:48,475
What's your mother's name?

347
00:11:48,476 --> 00:11:49,496
- Jung Ran. - My gosh.

348
00:11:49,915 --> 00:11:51,184
Okay. You're out.

349
00:11:51,185 --> 00:11:52,314
What's your mother's name?

350
00:11:52,315 --> 00:11:54,684
(Se Chan, Jong Kook, and Haha get up at the same time.)

351
00:11:54,685 --> 00:11:56,554
(3 of them are eliminated with just 1 question.)

352
00:11:56,555 --> 00:11:57,749
You're out.

353
00:11:57,956 --> 00:12:00,169
- Darn it. - Okay, you're out.

354
00:12:01,055 --> 00:12:02,350
I said my mom's name.

355
00:12:03,256 --> 00:12:04,965
- I said my mom's name. - Darn it.

356
00:12:04,966 --> 00:12:07,735
I guess fools are somehow connected.

357
00:12:07,736 --> 00:12:08,735
Why didn't you get up? Seriously.

358
00:12:08,736 --> 00:12:10,135
- Why didn't you get up? - Why didn't you get up?

359
00:12:10,136 --> 00:12:11,505
No. I'm not a fool.

360
00:12:11,506 --> 00:12:14,774
Ready, set, go.

361
00:12:14,775 --> 00:12:17,530
What's the title of your favorite song? Two syllables.

362
00:12:18,106 --> 00:12:19,941
- "Soaring". - Ask them a question.

363
00:12:20,275 --> 00:12:21,643
What's the tastiest fruit?

364
00:12:21,775 --> 00:12:23,755
- Banana. - Darn it.

365
00:12:24,116 --> 00:12:26,431
- Gosh, this is hard. - Name one memorable film.

366
00:12:26,586 --> 00:12:28,289
"Titanic".

367
00:12:28,785 --> 00:12:30,856
(Even Jung Seok is good.)

368
00:12:31,785 --> 00:12:35,090
What's your favorite English song?

369
00:12:35,525 --> 00:12:36,625
Four syllables.

370
00:12:36,626 --> 00:12:38,625
(The members don't know much about British and American culture.)

371
00:12:38,626 --> 00:12:39,794
My gosh, good job.

372
00:12:39,795 --> 00:12:40,948
"Yesterday".

373
00:12:42,636 --> 00:12:44,404
"Yesterday". It works.

374
00:12:44,405 --> 00:12:46,710
(Gosh, I approve.)

375
00:12:46,766 --> 00:12:47,975
I did it.

376
00:12:47,976 --> 00:12:49,097
(Feeling proud)

377
00:12:49,606 --> 00:12:51,745
- Do I ask a question now? - 5, 4,

378
00:12:51,746 --> 00:12:54,005
3, 2, 1.

379
00:12:54,006 --> 00:12:56,215
- Your time is up. - Go.

380
00:12:56,216 --> 00:12:57,544
(He's out as 5 seconds are up.)

381
00:12:57,545 --> 00:12:58,914
- What was that? - I got it.

382
00:12:58,915 --> 00:13:00,585
- What was that? - You have to ask a question.

383
00:13:00,586 --> 00:13:01,654
- What was that? - Wait.

384
00:13:01,655 --> 00:13:02,808
Go.

385
00:13:03,415 --> 00:13:05,803
You were supposed to ask a question.

386
00:13:05,886 --> 00:13:07,154
It's hard to think of a question.

387
00:13:07,155 --> 00:13:08,858
My goodness. Come on.

388
00:13:09,655 --> 00:13:10,675
- Gosh. - Ready,

389
00:13:11,425 --> 00:13:12,865
set, go.

390
00:13:12,866 --> 00:13:14,631
What's your charm?

391
00:13:15,096 --> 00:13:16,972
Eyebrows.

392
00:13:17,295 --> 00:13:19,173
Come on. That's a lie. That's not true.

393
00:13:20,466 --> 00:13:21,659
What's your favorite food?

394
00:13:22,905 --> 00:13:24,098
- Favorite food. - Tangsuyuk.

395
00:13:25,206 --> 00:13:29,122
What was the most entertaining book you read?

396
00:13:31,815 --> 00:13:34,345
(A four-syllable title?)

397
00:13:34,346 --> 00:13:36,191
No one can get up. Ji Hyo can't get up.

398
00:13:36,256 --> 00:13:37,541
She can't ever get up.

399
00:13:37,856 --> 00:13:39,955
(Gosh, books...)

400
00:13:39,956 --> 00:13:41,934
- "Madam Gurie". - "Madam Gurie"?

401
00:13:42,456 --> 00:13:43,649
I meant, "Madam Curie".

402
00:13:43,825 --> 00:13:45,024
"Madam Gurie".

403
00:13:45,025 --> 00:13:47,865
(What? "Madam Gurie"? Not, Madam Curie"?)

404
00:13:47,866 --> 00:13:49,735
(The Nobel Prize recipient becomes oats which are good for dieting.)

405
00:13:49,736 --> 00:13:51,704
- Isn't that "Madam Curie"? - What kind of book is that?

406
00:13:51,905 --> 00:13:53,190
- What kind of book is that? - Why Madam Gurie?

407
00:13:53,266 --> 00:13:54,388
Ji Hyo.

408
00:13:54,935 --> 00:13:56,934
- Gurie sounds like oats, the food. - What are you saying?

409
00:13:56,935 --> 00:13:58,074
What do you mean by Madam Gurie?

410
00:13:58,075 --> 00:14:00,249
- I was thinking, Madam Curie. - Hey.

411
00:14:00,476 --> 00:14:01,975
You're unbelievable.

412
00:14:01,976 --> 00:14:04,144
Did she only grow oats all her life?

413
00:14:04,145 --> 00:14:05,885
I was in a rush.

414
00:14:05,886 --> 00:14:07,314
(Was her common knowledge that shallow?)

415
00:14:07,315 --> 00:14:09,324
I'm sorry. Sir.

416
00:14:09,586 --> 00:14:11,684
Was there a video that goes by, "Madam Gurie"?

417
00:14:11,685 --> 00:14:12,924
No.

418
00:14:12,925 --> 00:14:14,965
- There's none? - Come on. Ji Hyo.

419
00:14:15,256 --> 00:14:16,480
That was funny. "Madam Gurie".

420
00:14:16,756 --> 00:14:18,995
All right. This is how you play this game.

421
00:14:18,996 --> 00:14:20,596
- Okay. - Okay. Great.

422
00:14:21,535 --> 00:14:23,025
Here we go. Get ready.

423
00:14:23,236 --> 00:14:25,064
I'm going to get up no matter what. Consider yourselves informed.

424
00:14:25,065 --> 00:14:26,465
All right. Go.

425
00:14:26,466 --> 00:14:28,904
What's the most upsetting thing you've heard in your life?

426
00:14:28,905 --> 00:14:30,058
Idiot.

427
00:14:30,636 --> 00:14:32,440
Who is your favorite actor?

428
00:14:33,746 --> 00:14:34,914
- Yu Jae Seok. - Jeon So Min.

429
00:14:34,915 --> 00:14:36,068
(Three syllables)

430
00:14:37,175 --> 00:14:38,920
(They answer at the same time.)

431
00:14:39,285 --> 00:14:40,541
Okay, okay.

432
00:14:41,216 --> 00:14:43,885
Come on. Why do we keep ending up together?

433
00:14:43,886 --> 00:14:46,125
- This is driving me crazy. - It's always you and me.

434
00:14:46,126 --> 00:14:47,755
- Why does this happen? - I have no idea.

435
00:14:47,756 --> 00:14:48,824
Ready,

436
00:14:48,825 --> 00:14:50,495
set, go.

437
00:14:50,496 --> 00:14:52,164
What do you want to be in your next life?

438
00:14:52,165 --> 00:14:54,324
(What do you want to be in your next life?)

439
00:14:54,325 --> 00:14:55,534
Dino.

440
00:14:55,535 --> 00:14:56,794
(She dreams of becoming a dinosaur.)

441
00:14:56,795 --> 00:14:57,927
You want to be a dinosaur?

442
00:14:58,206 --> 00:14:59,235
A dinosaur?

443
00:14:59,236 --> 00:15:00,434
That's two syllables.

444
00:15:00,435 --> 00:15:01,934
Why didn't you say "gino" instead?

445
00:15:01,935 --> 00:15:03,537
(Why didn't you say "gino" instead?)

446
00:15:03,636 --> 00:15:05,308
Whom do you want to see the most right now?

447
00:15:05,846 --> 00:15:06,926
My mother.

448
00:15:07,606 --> 00:15:09,644
What do you want to say to your loved one?

449
00:15:09,645 --> 00:15:11,175
(What do you want to say to your loved one?)

450
00:15:11,246 --> 00:15:12,414
I love you.

451
00:15:12,415 --> 00:15:13,710
- What? - I love you.

452
00:15:14,616 --> 00:15:16,799
What's a foreign destination you want to go right now?

453
00:15:17,356 --> 00:15:18,611
Croatia.

454
00:15:18,825 --> 00:15:19,907
What?

455
00:15:19,986 --> 00:15:21,178
(Five syllables)

456
00:15:21,356 --> 00:15:22,579
(What did you say?)

457
00:15:22,626 --> 00:15:24,154
- Croatia. - Croatia.

458
00:15:24,155 --> 00:15:25,552
- Hurry up. - Ask your question.

459
00:15:26,325 --> 00:15:29,865
How do you address your lover?

460
00:15:29,866 --> 00:15:30,956
Time's over.

461
00:15:31,266 --> 00:15:32,865
How do you address your lover?

462
00:15:32,866 --> 00:15:34,404
(His 5 seconds are up.)

463
00:15:34,405 --> 00:15:35,705
- What? - It took too long.

464
00:15:35,706 --> 00:15:36,859
Yoon A...

465
00:15:37,606 --> 00:15:39,345
- You failed. - She asked once again!

466
00:15:39,346 --> 00:15:41,794
- You failed. - I pronounced it clearly.

467
00:15:42,415 --> 00:15:43,574
(His answer was audible.)

468
00:15:43,575 --> 00:15:44,845
- Hey. - What was wrong...

469
00:15:44,846 --> 00:15:46,015
- with my pronunciation? - You can't waste any time.

470
00:15:46,016 --> 00:15:47,314
- You failed. - You failed.

471
00:15:47,315 --> 00:15:49,314
- You failed. - What was wrong?

472
00:15:49,315 --> 00:15:51,121
You failed.

473
00:15:51,586 --> 00:15:52,625
- Nightingale! - Night...

474
00:15:52,626 --> 00:15:54,085
(Jong Kook and Jung Seok talk simultaneously.)

475
00:15:54,086 --> 00:15:55,657
What are you afraid of?

476
00:15:55,756 --> 00:15:57,894
(They stand up together.)

477
00:15:57,895 --> 00:15:59,293
They failed.

478
00:15:59,795 --> 00:16:00,846
What did you do?

479
00:16:01,165 --> 00:16:03,635
I was just about to say, "ghost."

480
00:16:03,636 --> 00:16:05,265
But she stood up.

481
00:16:05,266 --> 00:16:06,531
All right.

482
00:16:06,866 --> 00:16:08,263
Let's go!

483
00:16:08,376 --> 00:16:10,135
- This is doable! - Let's do it!

484
00:16:10,136 --> 00:16:11,205
- This is doable! - Let's go!

485
00:16:11,206 --> 00:16:12,475
I'm going to win.

486
00:16:12,476 --> 00:16:14,105
- Okay. - I know for sure.

487
00:16:14,106 --> 00:16:15,914
If two people fail this round, the last one is the winner, right?

488
00:16:15,915 --> 00:16:17,174
- Right. - Okay, let's go.

489
00:16:17,175 --> 00:16:18,215
All right.

490
00:16:18,216 --> 00:16:19,236
Ready,

491
00:16:19,586 --> 00:16:20,885
set, go.

492
00:16:20,886 --> 00:16:22,313
What do you say to seduce the opposite gender?

493
00:16:23,356 --> 00:16:24,611
Okay!

494
00:16:25,825 --> 00:16:28,610
(So Min and Jae Seok fail so easily.)

495
00:16:28,825 --> 00:16:30,355
I didn't say anything.

496
00:16:30,356 --> 00:16:31,424
(They were doing so well.)

497
00:16:31,425 --> 00:16:32,524
(The final winner arises.)

498
00:16:32,525 --> 00:16:34,330
Gosh, Seok Jin.

499
00:16:34,425 --> 00:16:35,660
Okay!

500
00:16:35,895 --> 00:16:36,995
I won.

501
00:16:36,996 --> 00:16:40,534
The winner of this game is Seok Jin.

502
00:16:40,535 --> 00:16:41,835
(He has the right to choose the teams.)

503
00:16:41,836 --> 00:16:44,944
Now, you can pick 2 teams of 5...

504
00:16:44,945 --> 00:16:46,845
- however you want. - Okay.

505
00:16:46,846 --> 00:16:48,069
He won't pick me.

506
00:16:48,275 --> 00:16:50,153
Here's your mission.

507
00:16:50,376 --> 00:16:52,485
Your first mission which will give you hints about your numbers

508
00:16:52,486 --> 00:16:53,615
and grant you an Exchange Card...

509
00:16:53,616 --> 00:16:54,885
is Drink to Live.

510
00:16:54,886 --> 00:16:56,211
(Drink to Live)

511
00:16:56,285 --> 00:16:58,855
There will be one less drink on the round table...

512
00:16:58,856 --> 00:17:00,585
than the members participating.

513
00:17:00,586 --> 00:17:02,595
Go around the table and dance to the music.

514
00:17:02,596 --> 00:17:04,255
You win if you can down a drink each...

515
00:17:04,256 --> 00:17:05,652
to the sound of the whistle.

516
00:17:06,025 --> 00:17:07,695
However,

517
00:17:07,696 --> 00:17:10,665
one of the drinks is salted sikhye.

518
00:17:10,666 --> 00:17:11,765
Oh, no.

519
00:17:11,766 --> 00:17:14,604
If you can't down it and smile,

520
00:17:14,605 --> 00:17:15,804
you will lose.

521
00:17:15,805 --> 00:17:18,374
There's also a special stage.

522
00:17:18,375 --> 00:17:20,445
You can take turns dancing there.

523
00:17:20,446 --> 00:17:21,645
If you down...

524
00:17:21,646 --> 00:17:23,945
the sikhye, you will pass.

525
00:17:23,946 --> 00:17:26,332
The better you dance, the more advantage you'll gain.

526
00:17:26,385 --> 00:17:28,515
We need to form a competent team, right?

527
00:17:28,516 --> 00:17:29,576
Okay.

528
00:17:30,016 --> 00:17:31,106
Who can drink well?

529
00:17:31,355 --> 00:17:32,925
I'm good at that.

530
00:17:32,926 --> 00:17:34,185
- It's me. - Kwang Soo.

531
00:17:34,186 --> 00:17:35,195
Okay!

532
00:17:35,196 --> 00:17:36,522
(I'm good at drinking.)

533
00:17:37,095 --> 00:17:38,932
- So Min is good at dancing. - Okay!

534
00:17:39,095 --> 00:17:40,665
I'm good at dancing!

535
00:17:40,666 --> 00:17:41,961
Jong Kook.

536
00:17:42,166 --> 00:17:43,492
- Jong Kook. - Okay.

537
00:17:43,635 --> 00:17:44,962
I'm good at drinking.

538
00:17:45,406 --> 00:17:46,564
I am.

539
00:17:46,565 --> 00:17:47,759
This is a team?

540
00:17:47,865 --> 00:17:51,905
No, they will be competing against you.

541
00:17:51,906 --> 00:17:53,812
- They're your rivals. - We're going against each other.

542
00:17:55,216 --> 00:17:56,915
(Shocked)

543
00:17:56,916 --> 00:17:59,084
Hold on. We're not a team?

544
00:17:59,085 --> 00:18:00,114
I told you.

545
00:18:00,115 --> 00:18:02,084
- They're your rivals. - He didn't understand properly!

546
00:18:02,085 --> 00:18:03,155
(They're happy.)

547
00:18:03,156 --> 00:18:05,324
(He ended up forming the most formidable team.)

548
00:18:05,325 --> 00:18:07,354
I didn't get why you looked so happy.

549
00:18:07,355 --> 00:18:08,824
What are you saying?

550
00:18:08,926 --> 00:18:10,294
You told me to choose my team.

551
00:18:10,295 --> 00:18:11,765
I told you to choose the members you'll go against.

552
00:18:11,766 --> 00:18:12,925
Members I'll go against?

553
00:18:12,926 --> 00:18:15,852
You, you, you, you didn't get it again!

554
00:18:17,295 --> 00:18:18,734
Wait, we're going against each other?

555
00:18:19,035 --> 00:18:22,136
You, you, you, you didn't get it again!

556
00:18:23,676 --> 00:18:25,374
What have I done?

557
00:18:25,375 --> 00:18:26,804
This is irritating.

558
00:18:26,805 --> 00:18:27,896
Pick your last member.

559
00:18:28,746 --> 00:18:30,175
- Ji Hyo. - Okay.

560
00:18:30,176 --> 00:18:31,215
(He picks Ji Hyo.)

561
00:18:31,216 --> 00:18:33,344
You're a team.

562
00:18:33,345 --> 00:18:35,253
(Team members)

563
00:18:35,585 --> 00:18:36,943
My gosh.

564
00:18:37,016 --> 00:18:38,412
I picked all the wrong ones.

565
00:18:39,385 --> 00:18:41,524
Hold on. Why are there only three cups?

566
00:18:41,525 --> 00:18:43,330
- There's 1 over there. - There are 4 in total.

567
00:18:43,456 --> 00:18:45,435
The one who doesn't drink fails.

568
00:18:45,896 --> 00:18:47,195
If you drink the salted sikhye...

569
00:18:47,196 --> 00:18:49,294
- We just hold it in, right? - If you don't smile...

570
00:18:49,295 --> 00:18:50,765
or finish it, you fail.

571
00:18:50,766 --> 00:18:53,034
Seeing how big the cup is,

572
00:18:53,035 --> 00:18:54,834
they must've added a lot of salt.

573
00:18:54,835 --> 00:18:57,134
- Yes, it looks very salty. - My gosh.

574
00:18:57,135 --> 00:18:58,328
Here we go.

575
00:18:59,446 --> 00:19:00,802
- Let's go! - Do we walk around?

576
00:19:02,375 --> 00:19:03,539
It's techno music.

577
00:19:04,946 --> 00:19:06,680
(Dancing)

578
00:19:07,545 --> 00:19:08,739
I bet Seok Jin will fail.

579
00:19:11,016 --> 00:19:12,185
(Dancing)

580
00:19:12,186 --> 00:19:13,524
I bet Seok Jin will fail.

581
00:19:13,525 --> 00:19:15,699
(He dances like a loser.)

582
00:19:16,355 --> 00:19:18,405
So Min, go to the center.

583
00:19:19,365 --> 00:19:21,024
(She goes to the front...)

584
00:19:21,025 --> 00:19:23,165
(and shows off her patented dance.)

585
00:19:23,166 --> 00:19:24,664
(Shaking)

586
00:19:25,035 --> 00:19:26,189
(He can't bear to watch her.)

587
00:19:27,035 --> 00:19:28,361
(Next up is the giraffe.)

588
00:19:28,436 --> 00:19:29,628
(Swinging)

589
00:19:29,706 --> 00:19:30,961
I'm sick of that dance.

590
00:19:32,506 --> 00:19:33,800
Try a new move.

591
00:19:34,075 --> 00:19:36,289
(Get out of my way.)

592
00:19:36,345 --> 00:19:38,284
(It's Gurie time.)

593
00:19:41,045 --> 00:19:42,114
- Hey. - You have a certain vibe.

594
00:19:42,115 --> 00:19:43,442
It's Madam Gurie!

595
00:19:43,785 --> 00:19:45,185
You have a certain vibe.

596
00:19:45,186 --> 00:19:46,324
(Gurie shake)

597
00:19:46,325 --> 00:19:47,855
It's Madam Gurie!

598
00:19:48,156 --> 00:19:49,421
It's Madam Gurie!

599
00:19:50,295 --> 00:19:51,455
(She can't lose to her.)

600
00:19:51,456 --> 00:19:53,225
What is that?

601
00:19:53,226 --> 00:19:55,031
Gosh, So Min.

602
00:19:56,196 --> 00:19:57,797
(She's mimicking something.)

603
00:19:58,035 --> 00:19:59,364
(She shakes her legs.)

604
00:19:59,365 --> 00:20:00,385
Look.

605
00:20:00,835 --> 00:20:02,274
It's that dance, right?

606
00:20:02,275 --> 00:20:03,604
It's the crab dance.

607
00:20:03,605 --> 00:20:07,757
(Is she a Hunter doing her mission?)

608
00:20:08,375 --> 00:20:10,559
That's not true. Oh, no.

609
00:20:10,845 --> 00:20:14,044
(Jong Kook, Kwang Soo, and Ji Hyo get to drink.)

610
00:20:14,045 --> 00:20:15,054
Oh, no.

611
00:20:15,055 --> 00:20:16,340
I'll drink this.

612
00:20:17,016 --> 00:20:18,964
(She drinks the sweet sikhye.)

613
00:20:19,426 --> 00:20:20,685
Were we allowed to drink that?

614
00:20:20,686 --> 00:20:22,024
Seok Jin, you're out.

615
00:20:22,025 --> 00:20:23,076
What?

616
00:20:23,426 --> 00:20:25,159
Who got the salted one?

617
00:20:25,726 --> 00:20:28,334
(Which one of them drank the salted sikhye?)

618
00:20:28,335 --> 00:20:29,417
You need to smile.

619
00:20:29,766 --> 00:20:31,469
One of them drank the salted one, right?

620
00:20:31,936 --> 00:20:33,159
It's not me.

621
00:20:33,666 --> 00:20:35,304
(It's 1 of these 2.)

622
00:20:35,305 --> 00:20:36,935
I bet it's Gurie.

623
00:20:36,936 --> 00:20:38,638
Ji Hyo has a strange face.

624
00:20:39,275 --> 00:20:41,344
(Jong Kook downs it and smiles.)

625
00:20:41,345 --> 00:20:43,274
- What? - Who was it?

626
00:20:43,275 --> 00:20:44,344
(They both finish their drinks and smile.)

627
00:20:44,345 --> 00:20:46,223
Everyone except Seok Jin succeeds.

628
00:20:46,345 --> 00:20:47,614
- Who drank it? - It was you, right?

629
00:20:47,615 --> 00:20:49,084
No, it wasn't me.

630
00:20:49,085 --> 00:20:50,380
- It wasn't you? - It wasn't me either.

631
00:20:50,916 --> 00:20:52,324
It's you! You smell of salt!

632
00:20:52,325 --> 00:20:53,509
It was you!

633
00:20:54,156 --> 00:20:56,524
(He's caught because of the salty smell.)

634
00:20:56,525 --> 00:20:57,719
Gosh, that stinks!

635
00:20:58,295 --> 00:20:59,395
Was this the salted one?

636
00:20:59,396 --> 00:21:00,564
- It was. - Right.

637
00:21:00,565 --> 00:21:01,688
He smells like salted dry fish.

638
00:21:01,996 --> 00:21:03,395
(The taste disgusts him.)

639
00:21:03,396 --> 00:21:05,735
- He endured that? - It's completely salt.

640
00:21:05,736 --> 00:21:08,274
It's okay. We need sodium during the summer.

641
00:21:08,275 --> 00:21:10,449
(He's laidback.)

642
00:21:11,406 --> 00:21:12,445
My gosh.

643
00:21:12,446 --> 00:21:13,475
(Terrified)

644
00:21:13,476 --> 00:21:15,114
You guys all lost.

645
00:21:15,115 --> 00:21:16,515
He's amazing.

646
00:21:16,516 --> 00:21:19,015
Does this mean Seok Jin won the previous game for nothing?

647
00:21:19,016 --> 00:21:20,137
For nothing?

648
00:21:21,516 --> 00:21:22,584
Is it over?

649
00:21:22,585 --> 00:21:24,985
He formed a team and left the team himself.

650
00:21:24,986 --> 00:21:26,556
- He did. - How great.

651
00:21:26,756 --> 00:21:28,225
I can't believe him.

652
00:21:28,226 --> 00:21:29,824
He's like Bruce Willis in "Armageddon".

653
00:21:29,825 --> 00:21:31,425
Let's move onto round two.

654
00:21:31,426 --> 00:21:33,465
Please play the music.

655
00:21:33,466 --> 00:21:34,465
(4 of them remain.)

656
00:21:34,466 --> 00:21:36,195
(It's "Gee".)

657
00:21:36,196 --> 00:21:37,195
Let's go!

658
00:21:37,196 --> 00:21:39,102
(She anticipates their dances.)

659
00:21:40,506 --> 00:21:41,862
(Squirming)

660
00:21:42,575 --> 00:21:45,044
(All focus is on So Min.)

661
00:21:45,045 --> 00:21:46,304
I can't bear to watch her.

662
00:21:46,305 --> 00:21:48,865
I hate it when she does that!

663
00:21:49,746 --> 00:21:51,684
(She approaches the stage.)

664
00:21:52,216 --> 00:21:53,847
(After approaching the stage...)

665
00:21:54,216 --> 00:21:56,455
I hate those things!

666
00:21:56,456 --> 00:21:58,221
(If you can't prevent it, enjoy it.)

667
00:21:59,226 --> 00:22:01,155
(Take this.)

668
00:22:01,156 --> 00:22:03,093
(She acts cute.)

669
00:22:03,855 --> 00:22:05,564
- Does she think she's an idol? - She's good.

670
00:22:05,565 --> 00:22:07,943
I thought those were the original dance moves.

671
00:22:08,067 --> 00:22:12,567
<font color="#fcc89b">[VIU Ver] SBS E460 Running Man</font>

<font color="#ff5fa2">-♥ Ruo Xi ♥-</font>

672
00:22:12,736 --> 00:22:13,735
(She does the crab dance.)

673
00:22:13,736 --> 00:22:14,804
Hold on.

674
00:22:14,805 --> 00:22:16,134
(Wait a minute.)

675
00:22:16,135 --> 00:22:17,227
It's a mission.

676
00:22:17,605 --> 00:22:19,945
(Did she just do her mission?)

677
00:22:19,946 --> 00:22:21,507
No, it's not me.

678
00:22:21,676 --> 00:22:23,574
This is the dance.

679
00:22:23,575 --> 00:22:25,014
Wasn't that your mission?

680
00:22:25,146 --> 00:22:26,410
Am I right?

681
00:22:27,045 --> 00:22:28,245
(The whistle is blown.)

682
00:22:28,246 --> 00:22:30,021
So Min succeeds again.

683
00:22:30,055 --> 00:22:32,054
So Min was so passionate at dancing.

684
00:22:32,055 --> 00:22:33,185
(So Min drinks the sweet sikhye.)

685
00:22:33,186 --> 00:22:35,878
(Ji Hyo and Kwang Soo drink the remaining two.)

686
00:22:37,496 --> 00:22:38,564
(Trembling)

687
00:22:38,565 --> 00:22:39,995
- It's Kwang Soo. - It is.

688
00:22:39,996 --> 00:22:41,352
- It's him. - It's him.

689
00:22:42,466 --> 00:22:44,134
It's Kwang Soo.

690
00:22:44,135 --> 00:22:45,737
It's so obvious.

691
00:22:47,305 --> 00:22:49,244
I don't think the salt melted properly.

692
00:22:49,906 --> 00:22:51,945
Don't spit it out.

693
00:22:51,946 --> 00:22:53,005
(He hates it.)

694
00:22:53,006 --> 00:22:54,245
(He fails to finish it.)

695
00:22:54,246 --> 00:22:55,398
It looks so salty.

696
00:22:56,775 --> 00:22:58,175
It must be really salty.

697
00:22:58,176 --> 00:22:59,981
Kwang Soo, you're not a professional.

698
00:23:00,246 --> 00:23:01,306
What?

699
00:23:01,446 --> 00:23:02,986
(What did you say?)

700
00:23:03,156 --> 00:23:04,614
If I were you, I would've downed it.

701
00:23:04,615 --> 00:23:06,054
Let's find out in five minutes.

702
00:23:06,055 --> 00:23:07,524
It's impossible.

703
00:23:07,525 --> 00:23:09,594
- How bad is it? - Is it that horrible?

704
00:23:09,595 --> 00:23:11,054
- I drank it. - It's impossible.

705
00:23:11,055 --> 00:23:12,594
- How bad is it? - Here's the last round.

706
00:23:12,595 --> 00:23:13,789
- Is it that salty? - Hey!

707
00:23:13,926 --> 00:23:16,342
- Stealing water. - Stealing water.

708
00:23:17,095 --> 00:23:19,364
(Jong Kook suddenly steals Kwang Soo's water.)

709
00:23:19,365 --> 00:23:20,405
The mission was to steal someone else's water.

710
00:23:20,406 --> 00:23:22,134
He drank a lot of water already.

711
00:23:22,135 --> 00:23:24,624
- He drank twice. - I just drank it. I swear.

712
00:23:25,045 --> 00:23:26,606
Wasn't it stealing someone's soda?

713
00:23:26,845 --> 00:23:28,814
I remember it being "soda".

714
00:23:28,815 --> 00:23:30,114
Why are you drinking again?

715
00:23:30,115 --> 00:23:32,685
(Everyone is suspicious of him.)

716
00:23:32,686 --> 00:23:33,685
(Gulping)

717
00:23:33,686 --> 00:23:35,348
- What's wrong with you? - Why are you drinking it?

718
00:23:35,516 --> 00:23:37,255
You're drinking it because you stole it from Jong Kook.

719
00:23:37,256 --> 00:23:38,284
- What? - What?

720
00:23:38,285 --> 00:23:40,570
(He steals the water back from Jong Kook.)

721
00:23:41,325 --> 00:23:42,995
(He chokes.)

722
00:23:42,996 --> 00:23:44,124
You're right.

723
00:23:44,125 --> 00:23:45,364
- Right? - Yes.

724
00:23:45,365 --> 00:23:46,395
(I was sharp, wasn't I?)

725
00:23:46,396 --> 00:23:47,665
Try drinking salted sikhye then.

726
00:23:47,666 --> 00:23:49,981
(Kwang Soo is upset.)

727
00:23:50,196 --> 00:23:51,634
Try it,

728
00:23:51,635 --> 00:23:53,503
and let's see if you drink water afterward or not.

729
00:23:54,166 --> 00:23:55,534
We keep craving water.

730
00:23:55,535 --> 00:23:56,574
We can't help but drink it.

731
00:23:56,575 --> 00:23:58,035
That was a sharp observation.

732
00:23:58,275 --> 00:23:59,366
Let's find out.

733
00:23:59,575 --> 00:24:02,044
Let's move onto the next round. If it's okay with you,

734
00:24:02,045 --> 00:24:03,915
if the person who drank the salted sikhye can endure it,

735
00:24:03,916 --> 00:24:05,784
the one who didn't drink it will fail.

736
00:24:05,785 --> 00:24:06,985
- Okay. - That's good.

737
00:24:06,986 --> 00:24:08,015
(Endure the saltiness and you win.)

738
00:24:08,016 --> 00:24:09,685
It must be that strong.

739
00:24:09,686 --> 00:24:10,981
- It really must be. - I like that.

740
00:24:11,615 --> 00:24:12,808
Here we go.

741
00:24:12,926 --> 00:24:14,762
Please play the music.

742
00:24:15,355 --> 00:24:16,495
Let's go.

743
00:24:16,496 --> 00:24:19,965
(This song this time is "Mr. Chu".)

744
00:24:19,966 --> 00:24:21,455
It's "Mr. Chu" by Apink.

745
00:24:22,396 --> 00:24:24,334
(Madam Gurie steps up first.)

746
00:24:24,335 --> 00:24:25,661
(This is Gurie's chu.)

747
00:24:26,236 --> 00:24:27,256
(They sing along.)

748
00:24:27,936 --> 00:24:31,067
(It's as if Apink is here.)

749
00:24:32,146 --> 00:24:33,574
(Dancing)

750
00:24:33,575 --> 00:24:36,880
Her dance moves are accurate, but she's dancing halfheartedly.

751
00:24:37,775 --> 00:24:39,215
That's how our mothers dance.

752
00:24:39,216 --> 00:24:40,415
This is Madam Gurie's style.

753
00:24:40,416 --> 00:24:42,155
All her moves were correct.

754
00:24:42,156 --> 00:24:43,185
- That's right. - It's Madam Gurie's style.

755
00:24:43,186 --> 00:24:45,429
- But it looks halfhearted. - Come on.

756
00:24:45,785 --> 00:24:47,524
At least, I'm still dancing.

757
00:24:47,525 --> 00:24:48,794
(The fake idol member steals the stage.)

758
00:24:48,795 --> 00:24:50,020
I hate it when she does that.

759
00:24:50,456 --> 00:24:51,648
My gosh.

760
00:24:51,825 --> 00:24:53,600
She's just too much.

761
00:24:55,565 --> 00:24:57,134
(Madam Gurie and fake idol member)

762
00:24:57,135 --> 00:24:58,435
My gosh.

763
00:24:58,436 --> 00:25:01,165
(Who will be the final winner?)

764
00:25:01,166 --> 00:25:03,374
- We don't know who will win. - They just need to endure it.

765
00:25:03,375 --> 00:25:04,705
We don't know who will win yet.

766
00:25:04,706 --> 00:25:06,044
(If you endure the saltiness, you can win.)

767
00:25:06,045 --> 00:25:08,304
- It must be So Min. - I have no clue.

768
00:25:08,305 --> 00:25:10,044
You guys are incredible.

769
00:25:10,045 --> 00:25:11,544
Who got the salted sikhye?

770
00:25:11,545 --> 00:25:13,814
- It's So Min. - I think it's Ji Hyo.

771
00:25:13,815 --> 00:25:15,314
- It's So Min. - You need to smile.

772
00:25:15,315 --> 00:25:16,884
It's So Min. She can't finish it.

773
00:25:16,885 --> 00:25:18,054
She's done.

774
00:25:18,055 --> 00:25:19,124
It the salted sikhye if you need to pat it.

775
00:25:19,125 --> 00:25:20,380
This is incredible.

776
00:25:21,156 --> 00:25:22,482
She's crying.

777
00:25:22,555 --> 00:25:23,953
She's crying.

778
00:25:24,295 --> 00:25:26,495
(I sometimes cry.)

779
00:25:26,496 --> 00:25:28,324
(Smiling?)

780
00:25:28,325 --> 00:25:30,509
This isn't that type of a game.

781
00:25:30,896 --> 00:25:32,843
Why is she doing that?

782
00:25:34,506 --> 00:25:35,831
She's sad.

783
00:25:35,906 --> 00:25:37,104
This is true sadness.

784
00:25:37,105 --> 00:25:39,727
So Min wins.

785
00:25:39,906 --> 00:25:41,304
I agree.

786
00:25:41,305 --> 00:25:43,915
Let's get prepared for the next round.

787
00:25:43,916 --> 00:25:45,171
This team...

788
00:25:45,946 --> 00:25:47,685
is made of people who Seok Jin didn't pick.

789
00:25:47,686 --> 00:25:50,368
- That's right. - What have I done?

790
00:25:50,785 --> 00:25:52,050
We'll get started now.

791
00:25:52,085 --> 00:25:53,524
You need to pick that cup.

792
00:25:53,525 --> 00:25:55,229
That's the one to drink.

793
00:25:55,456 --> 00:25:58,862
(Who will win this round?)

794
00:25:59,295 --> 00:26:04,029
(It's "Genie" by Girls' Generation and the famous kicking dance.)

795
00:26:04,795 --> 00:26:08,465
Jung Seok, you seem determined for this round.

796
00:26:08,466 --> 00:26:09,700
(Taking one step at a time)

797
00:26:10,575 --> 00:26:12,443
(Getting started)

798
00:26:13,275 --> 00:26:14,374
Jung Seok...

799
00:26:14,375 --> 00:26:15,947
is ready to win.

800
00:26:17,476 --> 00:26:19,586
(Fancy move)

801
00:26:20,345 --> 00:26:21,509
(Even Yoon A agrees that his dance is good.)

802
00:26:22,486 --> 00:26:24,884
(Jae Seok tries to take over the mat.)

803
00:26:24,885 --> 00:26:26,084
Don't be greedy.

804
00:26:26,085 --> 00:26:27,105
(Kicks him out)

805
00:26:27,785 --> 00:26:29,530
(Get out of my way, grandpa!)

806
00:26:29,926 --> 00:26:31,695
(Kicking)

807
00:26:31,696 --> 00:26:33,624
(Get out of my way.)

808
00:26:33,625 --> 00:26:36,114
(Now it just seems like everyone is kicking each other.)

809
00:26:36,666 --> 00:26:38,848
That's pretty funny.

810
00:26:39,266 --> 00:26:40,705
(Exhausted from getting kicked)

811
00:26:40,706 --> 00:26:41,858
There she goes.

812
00:26:42,635 --> 00:26:43,675
She's the real one.

813
00:26:43,676 --> 00:26:45,787
(Seductive)

814
00:26:47,375 --> 00:26:48,947
She's so cool.

815
00:26:49,746 --> 00:26:51,445
When are you going to stop dancing?

816
00:26:51,446 --> 00:26:53,690
The original is different.

817
00:26:54,416 --> 00:26:56,558
She's so good.

818
00:26:56,686 --> 00:26:58,185
(This is not good.)

819
00:26:58,186 --> 00:27:00,123
(Barges onto the stage)

820
00:27:01,355 --> 00:27:03,395
(A disaster)

821
00:27:04,256 --> 00:27:06,465
(Kicking each other in the butt again)

822
00:27:06,466 --> 00:27:08,710
(Kicking is the trend.)

823
00:27:08,966 --> 00:27:11,342
- They're hilarious. - It's funny.

824
00:27:11,365 --> 00:27:12,385
(Their team is a disaster too.)

825
00:27:13,135 --> 00:27:14,634
My butt hurts.

826
00:27:14,635 --> 00:27:16,804
It hurts so much!

827
00:27:16,805 --> 00:27:17,959
(Blow the whistle already!)

828
00:27:19,006 --> 00:27:21,005
(I'm not just going to let others take my spotlight.)

829
00:27:21,006 --> 00:27:22,015
(The sikhye is mine.)

830
00:27:22,016 --> 00:27:23,444
Come on.

831
00:27:24,075 --> 00:27:25,136
No!

832
00:27:25,716 --> 00:27:26,745
It's spilling over.

833
00:27:26,746 --> 00:27:27,884
(The winner of the sweet sikhye...)

834
00:27:27,885 --> 00:27:30,584
(is Yoon A the dancing queen.)

835
00:27:30,585 --> 00:27:33,824
(Jung Seok, Jae Seok, and Se Chan took the leftover cups.)

836
00:27:33,825 --> 00:27:35,054
(Which one took the salty sikhye?)

837
00:27:35,055 --> 00:27:36,455
What a merciless team.

838
00:27:36,456 --> 00:27:37,455
(Which one took the salty sikhye?)

839
00:27:37,456 --> 00:27:38,995
Who is it?

840
00:27:38,996 --> 00:27:40,395
It's Jae Seok!

841
00:27:40,396 --> 00:27:41,487
It's him.

842
00:27:42,065 --> 00:27:43,695
(Chocking)

843
00:27:43,696 --> 00:27:45,602
(Panicking)

844
00:27:46,835 --> 00:27:49,763
- Just give up. - Just give up.

845
00:27:49,906 --> 00:27:51,205
- Two. - It's Jae Seok.

846
00:27:51,206 --> 00:27:52,981
- One. - Jae Seok?

847
00:27:53,105 --> 00:27:55,145
(Spits out the drink)

848
00:27:55,875 --> 00:28:00,215
(He wasn't professional enough to drink the salty sikhye. He's out.)

849
00:28:00,216 --> 00:28:03,011
- I can't win with my dancing. - You have to dance full-out.

850
00:28:03,186 --> 00:28:06,215
The next round begins now.

851
00:28:06,625 --> 00:28:09,155
(It's a song by TWICE.)

852
00:28:09,156 --> 00:28:12,053
I'm not good at dancing to cute songs like this.

853
00:28:12,696 --> 00:28:13,794
(Then get out of my way.)

854
00:28:13,795 --> 00:28:14,815
Wait.

855
00:28:15,065 --> 00:28:16,735
(She's the expert of cute dances.)

856
00:28:16,736 --> 00:28:18,094
(Yoon A takes over the stage again.)

857
00:28:18,095 --> 00:28:19,799
It's my turn!

858
00:28:20,506 --> 00:28:22,104
- Why are you dancing? - How can we dance?

859
00:28:22,105 --> 00:28:24,104
I can't dance with her taking over the stage.

860
00:28:24,105 --> 00:28:26,604
(Yoon A's never-ending solo)

861
00:28:26,605 --> 00:28:27,804
How can I dance when Yoon A is always taking over the stage?

862
00:28:27,805 --> 00:28:29,244
(Hey!)

863
00:28:30,075 --> 00:28:32,156
(It's my turn, Yoon A.)

864
00:28:33,646 --> 00:28:35,389
(Let me have my turn too.)

865
00:28:36,656 --> 00:28:38,255
(What are they doing?)

866
00:28:38,256 --> 00:28:39,581
- Se Chan, get out of the way. - Get out.

867
00:28:41,186 --> 00:28:43,195
(He's not getting off the stage anytime soon.)

868
00:28:43,726 --> 00:28:46,665
(Copy me if you can.)

869
00:28:46,666 --> 00:28:47,824
Come on.

870
00:28:47,825 --> 00:28:48,958
(Challenge accepted.)

871
00:28:49,896 --> 00:28:51,773
Jung Seok, what a funny guy.

872
00:28:52,406 --> 00:28:53,833
(The whistle blows)

873
00:28:53,966 --> 00:28:55,465
Yoon A.

874
00:28:56,206 --> 00:28:58,604
(There are two cups left on the other table.)

875
00:28:58,605 --> 00:29:00,274
- You still have a chance. - There's one behind you.

876
00:29:00,275 --> 00:29:01,274
Yours might be the sweet one.

877
00:29:01,275 --> 00:29:02,915
I don't have a good feeling about this.

878
00:29:02,916 --> 00:29:04,139
There are three left.

879
00:29:04,446 --> 00:29:05,945
(Which one will be the unfortunate loser?)

880
00:29:06,416 --> 00:29:08,017
(Spits out the drink)

881
00:29:08,585 --> 00:29:11,779
(Screaming in agony)

882
00:29:12,355 --> 00:29:13,455
You were the first one to grab the drink too.

883
00:29:13,456 --> 00:29:15,455
There's no way you can drink that.

884
00:29:15,456 --> 00:29:16,624
(I survived.)

885
00:29:16,625 --> 00:29:17,779
Yours wasn't salty?

886
00:29:18,996 --> 00:29:19,995
(Unlucky Se Chan fails.)

887
00:29:19,996 --> 00:29:21,117
It's way too salty.

888
00:29:21,696 --> 00:29:23,395
Those two are so good.

889
00:29:23,396 --> 00:29:24,465
They're the last two standing.

890
00:29:24,466 --> 00:29:26,104
- They're survivors. - It's their first time playing.

891
00:29:26,105 --> 00:29:27,505
They're really good.

892
00:29:27,506 --> 00:29:29,405
They're also both great dancers.

893
00:29:29,406 --> 00:29:31,853
There's no way of interrupting them.

894
00:29:31,906 --> 00:29:33,645
The last round is the same.

895
00:29:33,646 --> 00:29:36,215
If you can finish the salty sikhye, you survive.

896
00:29:36,216 --> 00:29:37,415
I don't think I can.

897
00:29:37,416 --> 00:29:39,252
- Me neither. - I don't think so.

898
00:29:40,085 --> 00:29:42,941
(This round, the song is "Gotta Go" by Chungha.)

899
00:29:43,585 --> 00:29:46,003
It's Chungha's song.

900
00:29:46,785 --> 00:29:49,141
(Dancing with so much energy)

901
00:29:50,996 --> 00:29:52,395
She's so good.

902
00:29:52,396 --> 00:29:54,404
Impressive.

903
00:29:55,065 --> 00:29:57,004
She's really good.

904
00:29:57,436 --> 00:29:58,721
(There's no way I can win.)

905
00:29:59,635 --> 00:30:00,665
What's he doing?

906
00:30:00,666 --> 00:30:02,604
(What is Jung Seok doing on the floor?)

907
00:30:02,605 --> 00:30:04,205
(Taking something out)

908
00:30:04,206 --> 00:30:05,226
What?

909
00:30:05,275 --> 00:30:06,735
(Here you go.)

910
00:30:08,045 --> 00:30:10,114
(Here comes Heart Jung Seok.)

911
00:30:10,115 --> 00:30:12,544
(Gummy, are you watching?)

912
00:30:12,545 --> 00:30:16,515
(Heart Jung Seok is stealing Yoon A's spotlight with his heart.)

913
00:30:16,516 --> 00:30:17,784
That was good.

914
00:30:17,785 --> 00:30:19,554
- So good. - You're doing great.

915
00:30:19,555 --> 00:30:20,824
You're doing great.

916
00:30:20,825 --> 00:30:21,925
Do it together.

917
00:30:21,926 --> 00:30:24,711
(Nobody can predict who will be the final winner at this point.)

918
00:30:24,926 --> 00:30:26,118
(Whistle blows)

919
00:30:26,926 --> 00:30:28,524
At this point, whoever can stand the salty sikhye wins.

920
00:30:28,525 --> 00:30:29,695
The final round.

921
00:30:29,696 --> 00:30:30,695
(One of them are drinking salty sikhye.)

922
00:30:30,696 --> 00:30:31,895
(Drink the salty one and you win.)

923
00:30:31,896 --> 00:30:33,364
One of them has salty sikhye.

924
00:30:33,365 --> 00:30:34,834
Which one of you is it?

925
00:30:34,835 --> 00:30:35,834
Is this real?

926
00:30:35,835 --> 00:30:37,435
- That's impressive. - Which one is it?

927
00:30:37,436 --> 00:30:39,675
(Who's drinking the salty sikhye?)

928
00:30:39,676 --> 00:30:41,685
(I can't drink it anymore.)

929
00:30:43,146 --> 00:30:44,515
(Flinches)

930
00:30:44,516 --> 00:30:47,199
(He surrenders to the salty sikhye.)

931
00:30:48,186 --> 00:30:49,716
(It was Jung Seok.)

932
00:30:50,785 --> 00:30:52,784
It's impossible to drink.

933
00:30:52,785 --> 00:30:54,084
So,

934
00:30:54,085 --> 00:30:56,425
the winners of each round...

935
00:30:56,426 --> 00:30:57,925
are So Min and Yoon A.

936
00:30:57,926 --> 00:30:59,895
(The winners of the first mission are So Min and Yoon A.)

937
00:30:59,896 --> 00:31:01,925
- Great. - You're really a great dancer.

938
00:31:01,926 --> 00:31:03,265
I have a chance now.

939
00:31:03,266 --> 00:31:05,665
So Min and Yoon A...

940
00:31:05,666 --> 00:31:07,951
can switch cards with a member of your choice.

941
00:31:08,706 --> 00:31:10,574
Choose a member that you want to switch cards with...

942
00:31:10,575 --> 00:31:13,405
and choose one of their cards to switch after looking at them.

943
00:31:13,406 --> 00:31:15,544
That gives so much leverage.

944
00:31:15,545 --> 00:31:16,544
(They get to see before they choose.)

945
00:31:16,545 --> 00:31:17,614
(Who will So Min choose?)

946
00:31:17,615 --> 00:31:18,945
I pick Dong Hoon.

947
00:31:18,946 --> 00:31:20,985
(So Min is choosing to switch with Haha.)

948
00:31:20,986 --> 00:31:24,626
(So Min currently has 22, 30 and 8.)

949
00:31:25,416 --> 00:31:28,425
(So Min can either choose to switch a card with Haha or leave as is.)

950
00:31:28,426 --> 00:31:29,755
It was worth the salty sikhye.

951
00:31:29,756 --> 00:31:32,265
- I made the right choice. - Please show So Min your cards.

952
00:31:32,266 --> 00:31:33,294
(Let's see.)

953
00:31:33,295 --> 00:31:34,999
My cards are amazing.

954
00:31:35,595 --> 00:31:39,104
My numbers are amazing. I can exit right now.

955
00:31:39,105 --> 00:31:42,064
(Haha has 2 cards in the 30s.)

956
00:31:42,906 --> 00:31:46,883
(The Hunter's ball was also in the 30s.)

957
00:31:47,446 --> 00:31:54,452
(What if all the weird things he did were for the Hunter's missions?)

958
00:31:55,385 --> 00:31:57,284
(If Haha is a Hunter, he could lose a card in the 30s.)

959
00:31:57,285 --> 00:31:59,624
Choose one to take and another to give.

960
00:31:59,625 --> 00:32:00,824
- Don't do it. - Of course, I will.

961
00:32:00,825 --> 00:32:01,925
- Of course, I will. - Don't do it.

962
00:32:01,926 --> 00:32:03,294
- Do I switch the cards now? - Yes, you can switch now.

963
00:32:03,295 --> 00:32:05,255
- Don't do it. - Give me 38.

964
00:32:05,256 --> 00:32:06,929
(Give me 38.)

965
00:32:07,696 --> 00:32:09,572
(So Min chose to switch cards with Haha.)

966
00:32:10,065 --> 00:32:11,973
- Show the card you're giving me. - This one.

967
00:32:12,635 --> 00:32:14,165
- And here you go. - Darn it.

968
00:32:14,166 --> 00:32:16,317
(So Min gave her 22 for Haha's 38.)

969
00:32:16,575 --> 00:32:18,208
How good is the card?

970
00:32:18,805 --> 00:32:20,744
I'm going to win today for sure.

971
00:32:20,746 --> 00:32:22,475
(So Min took Haha's biggest card, which was 38.)

972
00:32:22,476 --> 00:32:25,067
(So Min already had a card in the 30s,)

973
00:32:25,416 --> 00:32:28,751
(but during the mission, So Min also did weird stuff like the leg dance.)

974
00:32:29,956 --> 00:32:34,922
(She's willing to cry to win.)

975
00:32:36,295 --> 00:32:39,624
(If the Hunter's number is 30, could So Min be a Hunter?)

976
00:32:39,625 --> 00:32:41,563
(Could she be a Hunter?)

977
00:32:42,166 --> 00:32:43,421
They've switched now.

978
00:32:43,795 --> 00:32:45,294
Yoon A is up next.

979
00:32:45,295 --> 00:32:46,325
Okay.

980
00:32:46,635 --> 00:32:48,197
Aren't my cards amazing?

981
00:32:48,766 --> 00:32:49,826
I...

982
00:32:50,275 --> 00:32:51,435
choose Jae Seok.

983
00:32:51,436 --> 00:32:52,772
(I choose Jae Seok.)

984
00:32:53,805 --> 00:32:57,895
(Yoon A currently has 35, 36 and 3.)

985
00:32:58,986 --> 00:33:00,241
Jae Seok.

986
00:33:00,646 --> 00:33:03,033
Yoon A is choosing to look at your cards.

987
00:33:03,186 --> 00:33:05,584
Why are you doing this to me?

988
00:33:05,585 --> 00:33:07,255
(Yoon A can choose to either switch cards or not.)

989
00:33:07,256 --> 00:33:09,094
You're so mean.

990
00:33:09,095 --> 00:33:10,584
(Let me see your cards.)

991
00:33:11,825 --> 00:33:13,193
Seriously?

992
00:33:13,565 --> 00:33:15,465
- Then I'm... - Will you switch or will you pass?

993
00:33:15,466 --> 00:33:17,294
going to switch.

994
00:33:17,295 --> 00:33:18,662
- You're switching? - Yes.

995
00:33:18,936 --> 00:33:22,985
(Yoon A already has 2 cards in the 30s.)

996
00:33:23,476 --> 00:33:27,005
(She came late today, which is why everyone thinks she's a Hunter.)

997
00:33:27,006 --> 00:33:30,749
(Was it really because she was getting the Hunter's mission?)

998
00:33:32,216 --> 00:33:34,715
(Yoon A chooses...)

999
00:33:34,716 --> 00:33:36,084
- with the number on my back. - On your back?

1000
00:33:36,085 --> 00:33:37,784
Seriously?

1001
00:33:37,785 --> 00:33:39,524
Okay.

1002
00:33:39,525 --> 00:33:42,284
(Yoon A now has 35, 36 and 25.)

1003
00:33:42,285 --> 00:33:45,764
(If we add up all the 3 cards that Yoon A has,)

1004
00:33:47,095 --> 00:33:51,175
(she's the most likely one to be able to take the first exit.)

1005
00:33:52,095 --> 00:33:55,104
- The first round is now over. - Okay.

1006
00:33:55,105 --> 00:33:57,475
I'd be really shocked...

1007
00:33:57,476 --> 00:33:59,005
if the Hunters succeeded.

1008
00:33:59,006 --> 00:34:01,320
- I have no idea who it is. - Same.

1009
00:34:01,375 --> 00:34:03,691
(Did the Hunters succeed with their secret missions?)

1010
00:34:05,416 --> 00:34:07,114
What are these? People and situations?

1011
00:34:07,115 --> 00:34:10,685
Everyone, the second round will begin shortly.

1012
00:34:10,686 --> 00:34:13,102
Before that, I have an announcement.

1013
00:34:13,255 --> 00:34:15,995
There's a red light on the Hunter's door.

1014
00:34:15,996 --> 00:34:17,526
- The Hunters succeeded. - Did they?

1015
00:34:17,655 --> 00:34:21,525
(One of the Hunters succeeded in doing their secret mission.)

1016
00:34:21,526 --> 00:34:24,094
(Could it have been 1 of these 3?)

1017
00:34:24,095 --> 00:34:26,105
But the Hunters wouldn't have been able to do all the things we did.

1018
00:34:26,106 --> 00:34:28,705
Everyone drank water and put their hands on others' shoulders.

1019
00:34:28,706 --> 00:34:31,154
- I think... - Here's what happened.

1020
00:34:31,206 --> 00:34:32,399
A Hunter...

1021
00:34:33,675 --> 00:34:36,315
(The light only comes on when a Hunter clears a secret mission.)

1022
00:34:36,316 --> 00:34:38,795
(Which mission did the Hunter execute?)

1023
00:34:39,046 --> 00:34:40,545
One of the Hunters succeeded in secretly stealing...

1024
00:34:40,546 --> 00:34:41,614
something from a member.

1025
00:34:41,615 --> 00:34:43,784
- Steal? - They stole someone's belonging?

1026
00:34:43,785 --> 00:34:45,484
Did anyone lose anything?

1027
00:34:45,485 --> 00:34:46,710
(Before filming, during the Hunters meeting)

1028
00:34:47,655 --> 00:34:48,884
(Hunters chose...)

1029
00:34:48,885 --> 00:34:53,194
(three secret missions.)

1030
00:34:53,195 --> 00:34:55,495
(Change into a different pair of pants.)

1031
00:34:55,496 --> 00:34:57,935
(Steal one of the members' belongings.)

1032
00:34:57,936 --> 00:35:02,189
(These missions are all so difficult.)

1033
00:35:02,675 --> 00:35:04,674
(A Hunter stole someone's belongings.)

1034
00:35:04,675 --> 00:35:06,004
- Who is it? - I didn't lose anything.

1035
00:35:06,005 --> 00:35:07,205
Me neither.

1036
00:35:07,206 --> 00:35:09,358
- I didn't lose anything. - We don't have a lot of items.

1037
00:35:09,746 --> 00:35:10,844
What did you steal?

1038
00:35:10,845 --> 00:35:13,670
(What did you steal?)

1039
00:35:14,416 --> 00:35:16,214
What are you talking about?

1040
00:35:16,215 --> 00:35:17,440
What did he steal?

1041
00:35:17,655 --> 00:35:21,052
The second mission for card switching is...

1042
00:35:21,285 --> 00:35:22,554
- Action School. - What is that?

1043
00:35:22,555 --> 00:35:23,694
What's Action School?

1044
00:35:23,695 --> 00:35:25,295
It's a game played in pairs.

1045
00:35:25,296 --> 00:35:28,295
One person chooses a situation and a person without looking.

1046
00:35:28,296 --> 00:35:30,464
The other person acts out the words.

1047
00:35:30,465 --> 00:35:33,464
You're given three minutes to say the correct answer.

1048
00:35:33,465 --> 00:35:35,565
If the player gives the wrong answer,

1049
00:35:35,566 --> 00:35:38,335
shoot the player with your water gun without hesitation.

1050
00:35:38,336 --> 00:35:39,944
(Give the wrong answer, and you'll be shot with a water gun.)

1051
00:35:39,945 --> 00:35:42,915
Two teams with the most correct answers will be rewarded.

1052
00:35:42,916 --> 00:35:44,069
Second place is good too.

1053
00:35:44,146 --> 00:35:46,214
Now it's time to decide teams.

1054
00:35:46,215 --> 00:35:47,645
Your partner is important.

1055
00:35:47,646 --> 00:35:49,492
I'm good at guessing.

1056
00:35:49,516 --> 00:35:50,780
Draw one.

1057
00:35:52,356 --> 00:35:55,924
(Team Results)

1058
00:35:55,925 --> 00:35:57,863
Ready, and...

1059
00:35:59,396 --> 00:36:01,265
(Jong Kook picks two cards.)

1060
00:36:01,266 --> 00:36:02,346
All right.

1061
00:36:03,465 --> 00:36:05,335
(What?)

1062
00:36:05,336 --> 00:36:07,713
Is it even possible to act out those words?

1063
00:36:08,336 --> 00:36:09,804
(Jong Kook picked...)

1064
00:36:09,805 --> 00:36:12,457
("Talking back" and "Principal".)

1065
00:36:12,805 --> 00:36:14,344
(The player has to act out the words almost without talking.)

1066
00:36:14,345 --> 00:36:16,457
This is impossible. No way.

1067
00:36:16,776 --> 00:36:17,875
What?

1068
00:36:17,876 --> 00:36:19,212
(Panicking)

1069
00:36:19,316 --> 00:36:20,944
(He starts acting.)

1070
00:36:20,945 --> 00:36:22,924
(Testing the microphone)

1071
00:36:23,456 --> 00:36:24,781
That's clever.

1072
00:36:25,385 --> 00:36:27,984
(He is mimicking a principal making a speech.)

1073
00:36:27,985 --> 00:36:29,025
A microphone.

1074
00:36:29,026 --> 00:36:30,395
(I'm describing a person.)

1075
00:36:30,396 --> 00:36:31,395
A principal.

1076
00:36:31,396 --> 00:36:32,594
(Correct)

1077
00:36:32,595 --> 00:36:35,585
(Thanks to Se Chan's clever mime, Jong Kook gets the person right.)

1078
00:36:35,766 --> 00:36:39,539
(Se Chan has to mime "talking back" now.)

1079
00:36:39,905 --> 00:36:41,742
(Hilarious)

1080
00:36:42,266 --> 00:36:44,040
(Miming)

1081
00:36:44,706 --> 00:36:46,004
A complaining principal?

1082
00:36:46,005 --> 00:36:47,781
(You're getting close.)

1083
00:36:47,976 --> 00:36:50,158
- Gosh. - A principal picking a fight?

1084
00:36:51,316 --> 00:36:52,444
A frustrated principal?

1085
00:36:52,445 --> 00:36:53,537
(Se Chan is using his whole body.)

1086
00:36:53,916 --> 00:36:57,149
(I hate this. What? Do you have a problem?)

1087
00:36:57,316 --> 00:36:58,714
(It's something like this.)

1088
00:36:58,715 --> 00:36:59,725
Something like this.

1089
00:36:59,726 --> 00:37:01,654
Giving an excuse? What should I say?

1090
00:37:01,655 --> 00:37:02,754
I'm not allowed?

1091
00:37:02,755 --> 00:37:04,295
(Se Chan catches a chance.)

1092
00:37:04,296 --> 00:37:07,165
(He is literally talking back.)

1093
00:37:07,166 --> 00:37:08,795
- A rebelling principal? - Do you think I'm rebelling?

1094
00:37:08,796 --> 00:37:10,464
(He keeps talking back.)

1095
00:37:10,465 --> 00:37:12,265
- A principal acting up? - Am I acting up?

1096
00:37:12,266 --> 00:37:14,634
- That's brilliant. - I'm not acting up.

1097
00:37:14,635 --> 00:37:16,777
You say this to me all the time!

1098
00:37:17,305 --> 00:37:18,304
A lecturing principal?

1099
00:37:18,305 --> 00:37:19,344
I wasn't lecturing!

1100
00:37:19,345 --> 00:37:20,745
(He talks back again.)

1101
00:37:20,746 --> 00:37:22,684
This is the answer!

1102
00:37:23,175 --> 00:37:25,145
(It really is the answer.)

1103
00:37:25,146 --> 00:37:26,166
Well...

1104
00:37:26,586 --> 00:37:28,384
(Time's up.)

1105
00:37:28,385 --> 00:37:29,614
Jong Kook, "Talking back".

1106
00:37:29,615 --> 00:37:31,452
(Jong Kook and Se Chan fail.)

1107
00:37:31,615 --> 00:37:32,951
Jong Kook, "Talking back".

1108
00:37:35,086 --> 00:37:36,194
Hold on.

1109
00:37:36,195 --> 00:37:37,625
In this case...

1110
00:37:37,626 --> 00:37:39,084
- He's scolding Se Chan. - Look.

1111
00:37:39,266 --> 00:37:40,999
All right. "Talking".

1112
00:37:43,336 --> 00:37:44,620
You should have done this.

1113
00:37:44,635 --> 00:37:46,472
Then I would have known.

1114
00:37:46,666 --> 00:37:48,435
Otherwise, it's too hard.

1115
00:37:48,436 --> 00:37:49,803
It was difficult.

1116
00:37:50,805 --> 00:37:51,935
It's not easy.

1117
00:37:51,936 --> 00:37:53,434
It's too hard.

1118
00:37:53,675 --> 00:37:56,045
Why don't we say this was just practice?

1119
00:37:56,046 --> 00:37:57,375
- Good. - All right.

1120
00:37:57,376 --> 00:37:58,444
It's hard.

1121
00:37:58,445 --> 00:38:00,119
- All right. - Okay.

1122
00:38:00,516 --> 00:38:02,179
This is how you play.

1123
00:38:02,186 --> 00:38:03,815
You can return them.

1124
00:38:03,816 --> 00:38:05,111
- Okay, let's do this. - Jae Seok.

1125
00:38:05,115 --> 00:38:06,125
You act out the words.

1126
00:38:06,126 --> 00:38:07,308
I'm going to get them soaking wet.

1127
00:38:07,325 --> 00:38:09,192
I'm going to kill them.

1128
00:38:09,396 --> 00:38:10,824
- I'll take revenge. - Definitely.

1129
00:38:10,825 --> 00:38:12,630
Someone kept shooting me even after the game was over.

1130
00:38:12,965 --> 00:38:14,725
- And I saw who it was. - Kwang Soo.

1131
00:38:14,726 --> 00:38:16,065
(I saw who it was.)

1132
00:38:16,066 --> 00:38:17,666
(Surprised)

1133
00:38:18,066 --> 00:38:19,666
Seriously...

1134
00:38:20,405 --> 00:38:21,630
I'll...

1135
00:38:21,706 --> 00:38:23,775
I'll soak him completely.

1136
00:38:23,776 --> 00:38:25,335
(Indoor heavy rain warning)

1137
00:38:25,336 --> 00:38:26,444
This is...

1138
00:38:26,445 --> 00:38:28,139
(Jong Kook warns Kwang Soo that he'll take revenge.)

1139
00:38:28,146 --> 00:38:29,745
Please pick good cards.

1140
00:38:29,746 --> 00:38:31,475
I'll just go with my gut.

1141
00:38:31,476 --> 00:38:32,745
(What are the words for Jae Seok and Jung Seok?)

1142
00:38:32,746 --> 00:38:34,582
("Running into your first love on the street", "Shaman")

1143
00:38:34,646 --> 00:38:36,695
That's good. It's easy.

1144
00:38:36,885 --> 00:38:38,455
- Ready, and... - Start with this one.

1145
00:38:38,456 --> 00:38:39,679
Start with the person.

1146
00:38:40,586 --> 00:38:41,924
(He starts with exorcism.)

1147
00:38:41,925 --> 00:38:43,017
A psychic?

1148
00:38:44,055 --> 00:38:45,075
A psychic?

1149
00:38:45,226 --> 00:38:46,347
Three syllables.

1150
00:38:48,666 --> 00:38:51,534
(Let me splash some water on you.)

1151
00:38:51,535 --> 00:38:53,442
A shaman.

1152
00:38:53,735 --> 00:38:55,304
(Now it's time to get the situation right.)

1153
00:38:55,305 --> 00:38:56,907
A shaman...

1154
00:38:58,305 --> 00:39:01,574
(He is walking on the street.)

1155
00:39:01,575 --> 00:39:03,214
- Wait. - You ran into someone you know.

1156
00:39:03,215 --> 00:39:04,704
- Did we go to the same high school? - A shaman...

1157
00:39:04,876 --> 00:39:06,722
A shaman ran into his high school friend.

1158
00:39:06,746 --> 00:39:08,316
"Did we go to the same school?"

1159
00:39:08,385 --> 00:39:10,700
"Are you my high school first love?"

1160
00:39:11,316 --> 00:39:12,725
("High school first love" and "shaman")

1161
00:39:12,726 --> 00:39:13,984
(He just needs to combine the words right.)

1162
00:39:13,985 --> 00:39:16,094
(That's right.)

1163
00:39:16,095 --> 00:39:17,955
- He might get it right. - He'll get it right.

1164
00:39:17,956 --> 00:39:19,903
(Will Jae Seok get it right?)

1165
00:39:20,066 --> 00:39:22,025
"Did we go to high school together?"

1166
00:39:22,026 --> 00:39:24,765
(Jae Seok is too focused on high school.)

1167
00:39:24,766 --> 00:39:26,565
(He ends up acting instead of answering.)

1168
00:39:26,566 --> 00:39:28,734
I mean... Look.

1169
00:39:28,735 --> 00:39:31,153
Where am I right now?

1170
00:39:31,206 --> 00:39:32,777
You ran into your high school first love on the street.

1171
00:39:33,246 --> 00:39:35,448
A shaman's first love who he ran into on the street.

1172
00:39:35,476 --> 00:39:38,145
Say the person and the situation.

1173
00:39:38,146 --> 00:39:40,444
- A shaman's... - No.

1174
00:39:40,445 --> 00:39:41,914
A shaman is the person.

1175
00:39:42,146 --> 00:39:45,214
A shaman you ran into on the street who is your first love.

1176
00:39:45,215 --> 00:39:47,979
(Let me try.)

1177
00:39:48,126 --> 00:39:50,324
(Your first love has become a shaman.)

1178
00:39:50,325 --> 00:39:52,397
- What is that? - What are you talking about?

1179
00:39:53,166 --> 00:39:55,441
Gosh, this is frustrating.

1180
00:39:56,095 --> 00:39:57,795
- Why did you do that? - Is it really wrong?

1181
00:39:57,796 --> 00:39:59,295
It was almost correct.

1182
00:39:59,336 --> 00:40:02,058
You ran into your first love, and she became a shaman.

1183
00:40:02,876 --> 00:40:04,674
My first love became a shaman.

1184
00:40:04,675 --> 00:40:06,844
(Team Jae Seok fails because of Jae Seok's imagination.)

1185
00:40:06,845 --> 00:40:07,926
- Shall we give it a go? - Okay.

1186
00:40:08,646 --> 00:40:09,768
All right.

1187
00:40:10,345 --> 00:40:11,344
It's not easy.

1188
00:40:11,345 --> 00:40:13,049
- It's hard. - One correct answer is enough.

1189
00:40:13,845 --> 00:40:15,752
Ready, and...

1190
00:40:17,055 --> 00:40:18,382
- Knock, knock. - Knock, knock.

1191
00:40:18,985 --> 00:40:20,557
- Hello. - Greeting.

1192
00:40:20,655 --> 00:40:22,767
Keep watching. Hello.

1193
00:40:22,856 --> 00:40:24,254
Let me start.

1194
00:40:24,255 --> 00:40:26,424
(Auditioning)

1195
00:40:26,425 --> 00:40:28,506
- Auditioning. - Don't look for me

1196
00:40:28,595 --> 00:40:29,795
- An occupation. - An occupation?

1197
00:40:29,796 --> 00:40:31,495
An idol.

1198
00:40:31,496 --> 00:40:33,301
- An idol auditioning... - I mean...

1199
00:40:34,005 --> 00:40:36,275
I'm sorry. I'll do better next time.

1200
00:40:36,276 --> 00:40:37,500
- Bye. - An idol who failed an audition.

1201
00:40:38,706 --> 00:40:40,645
An idol failed an audition?

1202
00:40:40,646 --> 00:40:42,915
(Is that right?)

1203
00:40:42,916 --> 00:40:45,344
(Seok Jin says the wrong answer while making sure it's right.)

1204
00:40:45,345 --> 00:40:47,660
Next.

1205
00:40:47,916 --> 00:40:49,619
(Trumpeting)

1206
00:40:50,186 --> 00:40:51,236
No!

1207
00:40:51,485 --> 00:40:53,725
(She relies on...)

1208
00:40:53,726 --> 00:40:55,052
(onomatopoeia.)

1209
00:40:55,186 --> 00:40:57,324
(A performing elephant...)

1210
00:40:57,325 --> 00:40:59,464
(disciplined by the circus leader)

1211
00:40:59,465 --> 00:41:00,792
An elephant...

1212
00:41:00,896 --> 00:41:01,924
who failed an audition.

1213
00:41:01,925 --> 00:41:03,464
No. Try again.

1214
00:41:03,465 --> 00:41:05,464
(So Min succeeded in describing an elephant.)

1215
00:41:05,465 --> 00:41:07,234
A zookeeper who failed an audition.

1216
00:41:07,235 --> 00:41:08,593
No. Look.

1217
00:41:08,936 --> 00:41:10,775
(So Min switches to acrobatics.)

1218
00:41:10,776 --> 00:41:12,713
Someone failed an audition.

1219
00:41:12,845 --> 00:41:14,784
Uncle Tong.

1220
00:41:15,246 --> 00:41:16,415
(Uncle Tong appears in So Min's circus.)

1221
00:41:16,416 --> 00:41:17,671
- Uncle Tong. - No.

1222
00:41:17,816 --> 00:41:20,233
So Min, what happened to your hair?

1223
00:41:20,646 --> 00:41:23,085
(Her wet hair makes her look like...)

1224
00:41:23,086 --> 00:41:24,584
She looks like The Undertaker.

1225
00:41:25,385 --> 00:41:26,610
The Undertaker.

1226
00:41:27,385 --> 00:41:28,782
- Is this right? - Yes.

1227
00:41:29,055 --> 00:41:30,194
Gosh.

1228
00:41:30,195 --> 00:41:31,795
(Time's up.)

1229
00:41:31,796 --> 00:41:33,665
This one was right.

1230
00:41:33,666 --> 00:41:34,694
(Seok Jin and So Min got nothing right.)

1231
00:41:34,695 --> 00:41:35,765
- Just one... - That was close.

1232
00:41:35,766 --> 00:41:37,499
You just have to get one right.

1233
00:41:37,766 --> 00:41:39,935
- Who's next? - Kwang Soo.

1234
00:41:39,936 --> 00:41:41,165
(It's Kwang Soo and Yoon A's turn.)

1235
00:41:41,166 --> 00:41:43,004
I should fill up my water gun again.

1236
00:41:43,005 --> 00:41:44,770
- Fill it up, please. - Fill it up, please.

1237
00:41:44,876 --> 00:41:45,975
No.

1238
00:41:45,976 --> 00:41:47,231
Can I get another water gun?

1239
00:41:47,746 --> 00:41:50,145
- We almost got it right. - Give me one more water gun.

1240
00:41:50,146 --> 00:41:51,401
Unbelievable.

1241
00:41:51,816 --> 00:41:54,601
Jong Kook has two water guns.

1242
00:41:54,715 --> 00:41:55,844
It's Kwang Soo's turn.

1243
00:41:55,845 --> 00:41:56,984
(Because I love him so much.)

1244
00:41:56,985 --> 00:41:58,515
I got two water guns for him.

1245
00:41:59,155 --> 00:42:00,717
Aim at his shoes.

1246
00:42:01,155 --> 00:42:02,787
Get just one right, and you'll win.

1247
00:42:02,956 --> 00:42:04,254
Let's do this!

1248
00:42:04,255 --> 00:42:06,163
- Let's get just one right. - Let's do this.

1249
00:42:06,166 --> 00:42:08,725
You won't be able to see anything. There's no way you'll get it right.

1250
00:42:08,726 --> 00:42:11,895
(Try your best.)

1251
00:42:11,896 --> 00:42:13,265
(With Jong Kook's warning, Kwang Soo and Yoon A start.)

1252
00:42:13,266 --> 00:42:14,428
Ready,

1253
00:42:14,666 --> 00:42:15,756
and...

1254
00:42:17,405 --> 00:42:19,475
(What are the words for Kwang Soo and Yoon A?)

1255
00:42:19,476 --> 00:42:20,904
That's too easy.

1256
00:42:21,575 --> 00:42:22,729
Unbelievable.

1257
00:42:22,776 --> 00:42:23,875
This is the easiest so far.

1258
00:42:23,876 --> 00:42:25,650
(It's easier because it's only one word each.)

1259
00:42:25,715 --> 00:42:26,970
Food.

1260
00:42:27,046 --> 00:42:28,844
Rice.

1261
00:42:28,845 --> 00:42:31,099
Side dishes. Soup.

1262
00:42:31,816 --> 00:42:34,233
You should eat a balanced diet.

1263
00:42:34,255 --> 00:42:35,346
Say something.

1264
00:42:35,956 --> 00:42:37,077
Say something.

1265
00:42:37,595 --> 00:42:40,482
- Side dishes. Soup. - Say something.

1266
00:42:41,126 --> 00:42:42,694
This food is good for you.

1267
00:42:42,695 --> 00:42:43,990
- Eat this too. - A chef?

1268
00:42:46,635 --> 00:42:48,034
(He finally says the wrong answer.)

1269
00:42:48,035 --> 00:42:50,375
(The shooting starts.)

1270
00:42:50,376 --> 00:42:53,444
(As warned, Jong Kook pours water on Kwang Soo so that he can't see.)

1271
00:42:53,445 --> 00:42:55,344
- Baek Jong Won! - It's...

1272
00:42:55,345 --> 00:42:56,475
A cook.

1273
00:42:56,476 --> 00:42:57,475
(He's getting close.)

1274
00:42:57,476 --> 00:43:00,815
(Regional heavy rain warning)

1275
00:43:00,816 --> 00:43:03,100
No one is shooting Yoon A though.

1276
00:43:03,485 --> 00:43:05,214
(No one is shooting Yoon A though.)

1277
00:43:05,215 --> 00:43:07,025
- I can't... - Wait.

1278
00:43:07,026 --> 00:43:08,185
Keep going.

1279
00:43:08,186 --> 00:43:09,654
I'm eating this, this, and this.

1280
00:43:09,655 --> 00:43:10,754
But I don't want to eat this.

1281
00:43:10,755 --> 00:43:12,591
- She's talking too much. - You can't talk.

1282
00:43:12,626 --> 00:43:15,043
- You talked too much. - Did I?

1283
00:43:15,496 --> 00:43:17,765
(We failed?)

1284
00:43:17,766 --> 00:43:20,565
(You're allowed to say only the necessary things.)

1285
00:43:20,566 --> 00:43:21,835
Try again.

1286
00:43:21,836 --> 00:43:23,074
(I'm sorry, Kwang Soo.)

1287
00:43:23,075 --> 00:43:24,234
"Try again"?

1288
00:43:24,235 --> 00:43:25,975
(They pick a new pair of cards and try again.)

1289
00:43:25,976 --> 00:43:27,231
Yoon A is so funny.

1290
00:43:27,305 --> 00:43:28,304
Ready.

1291
00:43:28,305 --> 00:43:30,375
(They switch places.)

1292
00:43:30,376 --> 00:43:31,947
(What are the new words?)

1293
00:43:32,615 --> 00:43:33,815
- That's hard. - That's hard.

1294
00:43:33,816 --> 00:43:35,484
(Eating rice with ramyeon, A mother-in-law)

1295
00:43:35,485 --> 00:43:37,114
(Wedding march)

1296
00:43:37,115 --> 00:43:39,125
- Marriage. - "Marriage". Okay.

1297
00:43:40,255 --> 00:43:41,378
(Screaming)

1298
00:43:42,586 --> 00:43:44,594
(The water guns make her scream.)

1299
00:43:44,595 --> 00:43:46,565
Yoon A, look at me!

1300
00:43:46,566 --> 00:43:48,025
Come over here!

1301
00:43:48,266 --> 00:43:49,835
- You come here! - Look at me!

1302
00:43:49,836 --> 00:43:51,295
- Come here! - You have to look at me!

1303
00:43:51,296 --> 00:43:52,418
- No! - Yoon A!

1304
00:43:52,796 --> 00:43:53,959
Be careful.

1305
00:43:54,666 --> 00:43:56,542
- A microphone. - No.

1306
00:43:57,035 --> 00:43:58,157
Ramyeon.

1307
00:43:58,976 --> 00:44:00,332
- Ramyeon. - Well...

1308
00:44:01,106 --> 00:44:03,214
- Can I see the cards again? - Sorry.

1309
00:44:03,215 --> 00:44:05,545
(Can I see the cards again?)

1310
00:44:05,546 --> 00:44:08,850
(Yoon A hasn't recovered from the water guns.)

1311
00:44:10,055 --> 00:44:11,054
It's hot?

1312
00:44:11,055 --> 00:44:12,185
(It's time to describe rice.)

1313
00:44:12,186 --> 00:44:15,287
- Cooking starts - What?

1314
00:44:15,356 --> 00:44:16,525
(He sings the song from the rice cooker commercial.)

1315
00:44:16,526 --> 00:44:17,625
A fool!

1316
00:44:17,626 --> 00:44:18,694
(Yoon A says what she sees.)

1317
00:44:18,695 --> 00:44:20,725
A fool eating alone.

1318
00:44:20,726 --> 00:44:22,837
(Yoon A hurts Kwang Soo without meaning to.)

1319
00:44:23,135 --> 00:44:25,105
Have another bite.

1320
00:44:25,865 --> 00:44:27,105
- This... - Ramyeon.

1321
00:44:27,106 --> 00:44:28,605
- Gosh. - It's ramyeon.

1322
00:44:28,606 --> 00:44:29,799
I'm not full yet.

1323
00:44:30,876 --> 00:44:31,975
What should I do?

1324
00:44:31,976 --> 00:44:34,659
(I'm not full yet. It means he wants rice.)

1325
00:44:35,776 --> 00:44:37,444
My ramyeon is finished.

1326
00:44:37,445 --> 00:44:38,915
(It means it's time for rice.)

1327
00:44:38,916 --> 00:44:41,815
(If you've ever eaten ramyeon, you understand what he means.)

1328
00:44:41,816 --> 00:44:43,856
What? Rice in ramyeon?

1329
00:44:44,615 --> 00:44:46,625
(Time's up.)

1330
00:44:46,626 --> 00:44:48,424
It was too hard.

1331
00:44:48,425 --> 00:44:49,824
(Kwang Soo and Yoon A didn't get any right.)

1332
00:44:49,825 --> 00:44:51,630
It's hard to describe a mother-in-law.

1333
00:44:51,996 --> 00:44:53,424
All right.

1334
00:44:53,425 --> 00:44:55,058
I'll take off my shoes.

1335
00:44:55,266 --> 00:44:57,034
- He's smart. - He's well prepared.

1336
00:44:57,035 --> 00:44:58,134
I'm sure I'll get soaked.

1337
00:44:58,135 --> 00:44:59,594
- Ready. - Okay!

1338
00:44:59,595 --> 00:45:00,728
And...

1339
00:45:02,305 --> 00:45:06,252
(Panicking over a clogged toilet, Good-for-nothing)

1340
00:45:06,345 --> 00:45:07,805
That's easy.

1341
00:45:08,746 --> 00:45:11,327
(Se Chan starts describing a clogged toilet.)

1342
00:45:12,345 --> 00:45:14,444
(Gushing)

1343
00:45:14,445 --> 00:45:16,078
(Shocked)

1344
00:45:16,215 --> 00:45:17,254
This.

1345
00:45:17,255 --> 00:45:19,152
Jong Kook isn't saying anything to avoid getting sprayed.

1346
00:45:19,516 --> 00:45:21,056
- He isn't saying anything. - He isn't saying anything.

1347
00:45:21,356 --> 00:45:23,225
(You!)

1348
00:45:23,226 --> 00:45:25,654
(Me!)

1349
00:45:25,655 --> 00:45:27,165
(Se Chan means Jong Kook is a good-for-nothing.)

1350
00:45:27,166 --> 00:45:28,565
(He gets his point across.)

1351
00:45:28,566 --> 00:45:30,473
Kim Jong Kook with an overflowing toilet?

1352
00:45:31,396 --> 00:45:32,895
(They stand up and shoot with their water guns.)

1353
00:45:32,896 --> 00:45:34,205
Stop it. Stop it.

1354
00:45:34,206 --> 00:45:35,335
What about the toilet?

1355
00:45:35,336 --> 00:45:36,734
Stop it.

1356
00:45:36,735 --> 00:45:38,265
(What is he doing?)

1357
00:45:38,635 --> 00:45:39,634
(Those are the shoes Jong Kook took off.)

1358
00:45:39,635 --> 00:45:40,869
He is shooting at Jong Kook's shoes.

1359
00:45:42,445 --> 00:45:44,674
(He changed the target.)

1360
00:45:44,675 --> 00:45:48,083
(I will make sure they are soggy even after the game.)

1361
00:45:48,416 --> 00:45:49,782
Look at me! Look at me!

1362
00:45:51,055 --> 00:45:53,225
- Surprised? - It's something like that.

1363
00:45:53,226 --> 00:45:54,355
(It's hard to describe "Panicking".)

1364
00:45:54,356 --> 00:45:55,554
A clogged toilet.

1365
00:45:55,555 --> 00:45:57,725
(They shoot without stopping.)

1366
00:45:57,726 --> 00:45:59,908
Is this a water bomb festival?

1367
00:46:00,066 --> 00:46:01,364
Seriously.

1368
00:46:01,365 --> 00:46:03,170
Is this a water bomb festival?

1369
00:46:03,735 --> 00:46:05,734
So the toilet is clogged. Explain the rest!

1370
00:46:05,735 --> 00:46:06,765
Look at me.

1371
00:46:06,766 --> 00:46:08,565
What about the clogged toilet, you jerk?

1372
00:46:08,566 --> 00:46:10,634
(He gets annoyed since he isn't close to the answer.)

1373
00:46:10,635 --> 00:46:11,860
This is it.

1374
00:46:12,836 --> 00:46:14,105
What is this?

1375
00:46:14,106 --> 00:46:15,575
Panicking.

1376
00:46:15,805 --> 00:46:16,944
Kim Jong Kook.

1377
00:46:16,945 --> 00:46:17,944
(Kim Jong Kook who is panicking over a clogged toilet)

1378
00:46:17,945 --> 00:46:19,015
A good-for-nothing.

1379
00:46:19,016 --> 00:46:20,984
(A good-for-nothing who is panicking over a clogged toilet)

1380
00:46:20,985 --> 00:46:22,618
- Correct. - Is that correct?

1381
00:46:23,356 --> 00:46:26,154
Seeing Se Chan point at him,

1382
00:46:26,155 --> 00:46:27,585
he understood "good-for-nothing".

1383
00:46:27,586 --> 00:46:28,585
(He agrees he's a "good-for-nothing" of Running Man.)

1384
00:46:28,586 --> 00:46:30,391
He did a good job.

1385
00:46:30,496 --> 00:46:31,625
We need two minutes.

1386
00:46:31,626 --> 00:46:33,765
The microphones aren't working properly.

1387
00:46:33,766 --> 00:46:37,367
(They get their microphones fixed.)

1388
00:46:38,566 --> 00:46:40,634
Did someone shoot water in my shoes?

1389
00:46:40,635 --> 00:46:42,335
(This is strange.)

1390
00:46:42,336 --> 00:46:44,475
(Startled)

1391
00:46:44,476 --> 00:46:46,875
(Kwang Soo acts like he doesn't know anything.)

1392
00:46:46,876 --> 00:46:49,145
(You did this.)

1393
00:46:49,146 --> 00:46:51,563
Okay. I got it.

1394
00:46:51,646 --> 00:46:54,444
(What? Me?)

1395
00:46:54,445 --> 00:46:56,455
My shoes are very wet.

1396
00:46:56,456 --> 00:46:57,455
(It's all thanks to Kwang Soo.)

1397
00:46:57,456 --> 00:46:58,515
(I did my best.)

1398
00:46:58,516 --> 00:47:00,463
Seriously. Okay.

1399
00:47:00,856 --> 00:47:02,585
(At that moment)

1400
00:47:02,586 --> 00:47:04,694
(Looking around)

1401
00:47:04,695 --> 00:47:07,746
(He looks around before he leaves the studio.)

1402
00:47:07,746 --> 00:47:10,545
You prepared two pairs of jeans, right?

1403
00:47:10,570 --> 00:47:12,810
(Jung Seok suddenly looks for a pair of jeans.)

1404
00:47:14,546 --> 00:47:17,369
You prepared two pairs of jeans, right?

1405
00:47:17,370 --> 00:47:19,655
(Jung Seok suddenly looks for a pair of jeans.)

1406
00:47:19,783 --> 00:47:22,303
(One of the secret missions the Hunters need to carry out is...)

1407
00:47:22,584 --> 00:47:25,543
("Change into different pants.")

1408
00:47:25,544 --> 00:47:28,164
That's one of the secret missions.

1409
00:47:28,987 --> 00:47:30,282
My goodness.

1410
00:47:30,797 --> 00:47:33,040
- All right. - Let's go.

1411
00:47:33,167 --> 00:47:34,495
- Let's go. - Let's go.

1412
00:47:34,496 --> 00:47:35,765
(Jung Seok returns to his seat.)

1413
00:47:35,766 --> 00:47:37,166
- Jung Seok. - My goodness.

1414
00:47:37,167 --> 00:47:38,236
The microphone.

1415
00:47:38,237 --> 00:47:40,166
(On his pants,)

1416
00:47:40,167 --> 00:47:43,336
(the wet spots have changed.)

1417
00:47:43,337 --> 00:47:44,905
- Get ready. - Let's go.

1418
00:47:44,906 --> 00:47:46,641
Set, go.

1419
00:47:46,906 --> 00:47:48,783
- Okay. - Jung Seok,

1420
00:47:49,107 --> 00:47:50,605
you are a Hunter of this race.

1421
00:47:52,317 --> 00:47:54,115
(The first Hunter, Cho Jung Seok)

1422
00:47:54,116 --> 00:47:56,256
This is my third visit to the show.

1423
00:47:56,257 --> 00:47:58,555
If I do something I haven't done before,

1424
00:47:58,556 --> 00:48:00,016
they will know.

1425
00:48:00,426 --> 00:48:01,586
We are almost there.

1426
00:48:01,587 --> 00:48:04,825
(This Hunter completed a hidden mission with ease.)

1427
00:48:04,826 --> 00:48:06,765
(During the game,)

1428
00:48:06,766 --> 00:48:10,765
(he shoots the water at his own pants.)

1429
00:48:10,766 --> 00:48:12,535
(He is daring and meticulous beyond expectations.)

1430
00:48:12,536 --> 00:48:14,765
I have an announcement to make.

1431
00:48:14,766 --> 00:48:16,571
At this point...

1432
00:48:16,636 --> 00:48:17,931
- What? - Did someone complete a mission?

1433
00:48:18,107 --> 00:48:19,330
Did someone complete a mission?

1434
00:48:19,507 --> 00:48:21,506
If a Hunter has the Hunter's number,

1435
00:48:21,507 --> 00:48:23,115
they will be attempting their secret missions.

1436
00:48:23,116 --> 00:48:24,216
- That's right. - Really?

1437
00:48:24,217 --> 00:48:25,975
If a Hunter doesn't have the Hunter's number,

1438
00:48:25,976 --> 00:48:27,845
completing a mission is meaningless.

1439
00:48:27,846 --> 00:48:29,216
(The mission is pointless.)

1440
00:48:29,217 --> 00:48:31,155
(The secret mission doesn't count without the number.)

1441
00:48:31,156 --> 00:48:32,785
(Thus, "Change into different pants" didn't count.)

1442
00:48:32,786 --> 00:48:35,555
What does that mean? It's a message to the Hunters.

1443
00:48:35,556 --> 00:48:37,055
- Right? - I guess a Hunter did a mission...

1444
00:48:37,056 --> 00:48:38,626
- without the Hunter's number. - It seems that way.

1445
00:48:38,627 --> 00:48:41,421
Who is it? It must be one of the fools.

1446
00:48:41,996 --> 00:48:43,995
You are right. This Hunter is a fool.

1447
00:48:43,996 --> 00:48:45,166
A foolish Hunter.

1448
00:48:45,167 --> 00:48:47,206
All right. Which team will go next?

1449
00:48:47,207 --> 00:48:48,737
Since you don't have...

1450
00:48:48,806 --> 00:48:51,276
the Hunter's number yet, doing the missions is meaningless.

1451
00:48:51,277 --> 00:48:54,062
Why do you keep saying I'm a Hunter? For goodness' sake.

1452
00:48:54,607 --> 00:48:55,800
Let's go.

1453
00:48:55,906 --> 00:48:57,975
Kwang Soo thinks I am a Hunter.

1454
00:48:57,976 --> 00:49:00,466
(He wishes he wasn't a Hunter.)

1455
00:49:00,516 --> 00:49:01,515
Get ready.

1456
00:49:01,516 --> 00:49:03,385
(Haha and Ji Hyo are up for the last game.)

1457
00:49:03,386 --> 00:49:05,324
(Awake and late for school, Middle school girl)

1458
00:49:05,616 --> 00:49:07,290
I want to go to high school.

1459
00:49:07,357 --> 00:49:09,325
When will I attend high school?

1460
00:49:09,826 --> 00:49:10,918
A middle school student.

1461
00:49:12,027 --> 00:49:13,862
A middle school student. A girl?

1462
00:49:14,326 --> 00:49:15,495
Combine.

1463
00:49:15,496 --> 00:49:16,666
(Combine the two!)

1464
00:49:16,667 --> 00:49:17,788
A middle school girl.

1465
00:49:18,897 --> 00:49:20,192
She woke up but is late.

1466
00:49:20,406 --> 00:49:21,559
She is late.

1467
00:49:21,766 --> 00:49:23,817
A middle school girl who up and is late.

1468
00:49:24,007 --> 00:49:25,006
Haha.

1469
00:49:25,007 --> 00:49:26,405
(They fail because they didn't get the "For school" part.)

1470
00:49:26,406 --> 00:49:27,475
Okay.

1471
00:49:27,476 --> 00:49:29,245
She is late for school.

1472
00:49:29,246 --> 00:49:31,345
Thus, the first place goes...

1473
00:49:31,346 --> 00:49:32,845
- to Team Jong Kook and Se Chan. - Okay.

1474
00:49:32,846 --> 00:49:33,885
Okay.

1475
00:49:33,886 --> 00:49:35,515
The second place goes to Team Haha and Ji Hyo.

1476
00:49:35,516 --> 00:49:36,615
Okay.

1477
00:49:36,616 --> 00:49:37,856
(Haha and Ji Hyo came close to the answer.)

1478
00:49:37,857 --> 00:49:39,756
(It's time to switch cards.)

1479
00:49:39,757 --> 00:49:41,155
One at a time.

1480
00:49:41,156 --> 00:49:43,952
Either Jong Kook or Se Chan should come forward first.

1481
00:49:44,096 --> 00:49:46,566
It's meaningless unless you come in first.

1482
00:49:46,567 --> 00:49:47,822
You can't escape.

1483
00:49:47,826 --> 00:49:50,651
I will exchange my card with Yoon A's card.

1484
00:49:50,766 --> 00:49:52,035
- Yoon A? - Yes.

1485
00:49:52,036 --> 00:49:53,805
Se Chan chose Yoon A.

1486
00:49:53,806 --> 00:49:54,960
- What? - All right.

1487
00:49:55,607 --> 00:49:57,635
You must need the number on Yoon A's back.

1488
00:49:57,636 --> 00:49:58,656
What?

1489
00:49:58,676 --> 00:50:00,305
Does he need the number on Yoon A's back?

1490
00:50:00,306 --> 00:50:02,006
- Is this what you want? - You need to give that to him.

1491
00:50:02,007 --> 00:50:03,445
- This one? - Yes.

1492
00:50:04,717 --> 00:50:06,001
Is this the right number?

1493
00:50:06,246 --> 00:50:07,573
(Se Chan took 35 from Yoon A.)

1494
00:50:07,647 --> 00:50:08,785
(If Yoon A is a Hunter, did she lose the Hunter's number?)

1495
00:50:08,786 --> 00:50:09,785
I am done.

1496
00:50:09,786 --> 00:50:11,215
You can go back to your seat.

1497
00:50:11,286 --> 00:50:13,626
I just need one card...

1498
00:50:13,627 --> 00:50:15,055
to exit.

1499
00:50:15,687 --> 00:50:16,796
I choose So Min.

1500
00:50:16,797 --> 00:50:17,856
(Jong Kook choose So Min.)

1501
00:50:17,857 --> 00:50:19,765
So Min, please come forward.

1502
00:50:19,766 --> 00:50:20,896
(A lot of people think So Min is a Hunter.)

1503
00:50:20,897 --> 00:50:23,518
It's not like that. I didn't know I could exit during all this.

1504
00:50:23,567 --> 00:50:25,127
- I should have exited. - I didn't know either.

1505
00:50:25,536 --> 00:50:26,606
Hold on.

1506
00:50:26,607 --> 00:50:27,765
- She didn't know? - So Min.

1507
00:50:27,766 --> 00:50:29,501
You aren't at a resort.

1508
00:50:30,377 --> 00:50:32,175
- Do you think... - You look like...

1509
00:50:32,176 --> 00:50:34,046
you are on a vacation at Haeundae.

1510
00:50:34,047 --> 00:50:35,646
So Min, what are you doing?

1511
00:50:35,647 --> 00:50:37,646
I am so upset.

1512
00:50:37,647 --> 00:50:38,870
I will exchange the number on my back...

1513
00:50:39,076 --> 00:50:40,885
- with this. - Then he will know everything.

1514
00:50:40,886 --> 00:50:42,245
I will exchange the number on my back with this.

1515
00:50:42,246 --> 00:50:43,756
Then he will know everything.

1516
00:50:43,757 --> 00:50:45,885
- Hurry up. - This is a disaster.

1517
00:50:45,886 --> 00:50:47,486
I won't be able to leave!

1518
00:50:47,487 --> 00:50:49,285
(Did So Min get the Hunter's number taken away?)

1519
00:50:49,286 --> 00:50:51,234
- This is incredible. - Okay.

1520
00:50:51,326 --> 00:50:53,264
I think I can exit right now with these numbers.

1521
00:50:53,627 --> 00:50:54,995
He must have 40.

1522
00:50:54,996 --> 00:50:56,236
(Jong Kook has 38, 21, and 32. Does anyone have a higher total?)

1523
00:50:56,237 --> 00:50:57,767
I wonder if anyone has a higher total.

1524
00:50:57,967 --> 00:50:59,874
I will take this one.

1525
00:51:00,207 --> 00:51:01,535
Okay.

1526
00:51:01,536 --> 00:51:03,376
(Ji Hyo exchanges her 4 with Jung Seok's 28.)

1527
00:51:03,377 --> 00:51:05,135
- Give it to her. - Okay.

1528
00:51:05,136 --> 00:51:06,646
This is driving me crazy.

1529
00:51:06,647 --> 00:51:08,075
- You can go back to your seats. - Let's go.

1530
00:51:08,076 --> 00:51:09,376
They are done.

1531
00:51:09,377 --> 00:51:11,376
Currently, there are five exits left.

1532
00:51:11,377 --> 00:51:13,086
The member with the biggest sum of the three cards.

1533
00:51:13,087 --> 00:51:15,316
The member with three consecutive numbers.

1534
00:51:15,317 --> 00:51:17,555
The member with 3 multiples of 5.

1535
00:51:17,556 --> 00:51:20,356
The member with 4 of the same number from the 3 cards.

1536
00:51:20,357 --> 00:51:22,126
The last exit is...

1537
00:51:22,127 --> 00:51:23,225
the Hunter's door.

1538
00:51:23,226 --> 00:51:24,456
(The members and Hunters must meet the conditions and escape.)

1539
00:51:24,457 --> 00:51:27,322
- Okay. - The Hunters must be anxious.

1540
00:51:27,326 --> 00:51:29,265
We can leave during the third round, right?

1541
00:51:29,266 --> 00:51:30,868
You can leave anytime.

1542
00:51:30,937 --> 00:51:32,195
Okay. I understood.

1543
00:51:32,196 --> 00:51:34,512
- Let's go. - Let me get changed first.

1544
00:51:36,107 --> 00:51:38,585
- Let's go. - No one is leaving, right?

1545
00:51:38,806 --> 00:51:40,046
I need to use the restroom.

1546
00:51:40,047 --> 00:51:41,475
(Everyone goes to get changed.)

1547
00:51:41,476 --> 00:51:43,281
I need to get changed.

1548
00:51:44,676 --> 00:51:46,727
(At that moment!)

1549
00:51:48,016 --> 00:51:49,515
(Exit 2, The member with 3 consecutive numbers)

1550
00:51:49,516 --> 00:51:50,856
All right.

1551
00:51:50,857 --> 00:51:54,662
(At Exit 2 is Yang Se Chan.)

1552
00:51:55,687 --> 00:51:57,896
(The numbers Se Chan has are...)

1553
00:51:57,897 --> 00:51:59,765
I have 33, 34...

1554
00:51:59,766 --> 00:52:02,026
(33, 34,)

1555
00:52:02,027 --> 00:52:04,239
(and 35.)

1556
00:52:04,297 --> 00:52:06,736
(He got 35 from Yoon A and made 3 consecutive numbers.)

1557
00:52:06,737 --> 00:52:08,604
I will go and enjoy the day.

1558
00:52:10,337 --> 00:52:12,336
(He goes out through Exit 2...)

1559
00:52:12,337 --> 00:52:14,376
(and becomes the first person to escape.)

1560
00:52:14,377 --> 00:52:17,615
(He enters Good Place.)

1561
00:52:17,616 --> 00:52:19,546
(Good Place)

1562
00:52:19,547 --> 00:52:21,885
(It's a luxurious place only the escapees can enjoy.)

1563
00:52:21,886 --> 00:52:23,416
My goodness.

1564
00:52:23,417 --> 00:52:26,086
(Food for the hungry stomach and services for the tired body)

1565
00:52:26,087 --> 00:52:28,637
Then... I can enjoy anything, right?

1566
00:52:29,357 --> 00:52:30,418
I can enjoy everything?

1567
00:52:30,596 --> 00:52:31,725
Really?

1568
00:52:31,726 --> 00:52:33,166
(The members who escaped don't need to pay.)

1569
00:52:33,167 --> 00:52:35,237
I will show you how much money I can spend.

1570
00:52:35,467 --> 00:52:38,066
I have an announcement to make before we start the race.

1571
00:52:38,067 --> 00:52:39,666
Se Chan...

1572
00:52:39,667 --> 00:52:41,035
Did he escape?

1573
00:52:41,036 --> 00:52:44,137
He used the exit that requires three consecutive numbers.

1574
00:52:45,536 --> 00:52:47,546
(The news of Se Chan's escape...)

1575
00:52:47,547 --> 00:52:48,575
(shocks everyone.)

1576
00:52:48,576 --> 00:52:50,276
- Did he escape? - Three consecutive numbers.

1577
00:52:50,277 --> 00:52:51,345
No way.

1578
00:52:51,346 --> 00:52:52,845
I thought he was going for 3 multiples of 5.

1579
00:52:52,846 --> 00:52:54,546
- Me too. - That exit is closed, right?

1580
00:52:54,547 --> 00:52:57,285
That's right. If you were going for three consecutive numbers,

1581
00:52:57,286 --> 00:52:59,186
you should find a different way.

1582
00:52:59,187 --> 00:53:00,686
(Exit 2 is closed.)

1583
00:53:00,687 --> 00:53:02,225
- I got goosebumps. - I can't believe it.

1584
00:53:02,226 --> 00:53:03,655
(He just needed to get 28.)

1585
00:53:03,656 --> 00:53:05,425
Se Chan is lucky these days.

1586
00:53:05,426 --> 00:53:07,666
For your information, the amount of money...

1587
00:53:07,667 --> 00:53:09,736
Se Chan purchased in this short period of time...

1588
00:53:09,737 --> 00:53:12,419
Why did he get this done? He got a basic manicure.

1589
00:53:13,136 --> 00:53:14,666
(Did he get a manicure?)

1590
00:53:14,667 --> 00:53:15,993
- What? - Why?

1591
00:53:16,266 --> 00:53:17,836
Did he get a manicure?

1592
00:53:17,837 --> 00:53:20,675
He got a facial massage and ordered the Korean beef special.

1593
00:53:20,676 --> 00:53:22,646
He also ordered a tiramisu. He used 156 dollars so far.

1594
00:53:22,647 --> 00:53:23,816
He is crazy.

1595
00:53:23,817 --> 00:53:25,174
(He used 156 dollars in 15 minutes.)

1596
00:53:25,717 --> 00:53:27,416
- I need to hurry up and escape. - He is crazy.

1597
00:53:27,417 --> 00:53:29,515
- What? 156 dollars? - He's spoiling himself.

1598
00:53:29,516 --> 00:53:30,515
Also,

1599
00:53:30,516 --> 00:53:33,055
Currently, two of the Hunter's lights have come on.

1600
00:53:33,056 --> 00:53:35,456
(Two of Hunter's lights came on.)

1601
00:53:35,457 --> 00:53:37,293
- When did they do the missions? - Seriously.

1602
00:53:37,897 --> 00:53:39,284
That Hunter...

1603
00:53:39,496 --> 00:53:40,865
changed his or her pants.

1604
00:53:40,866 --> 00:53:42,225
It was necessary.

1605
00:53:42,226 --> 00:53:43,396
- Hold on. - Everyone's pants were wet.

1606
00:53:43,397 --> 00:53:45,095
Everyone's pants were wet.

1607
00:53:45,096 --> 00:53:49,066
- Everyone changed except for you. - I didn't get changed.

1608
00:53:49,067 --> 00:53:51,236
That means I am not a Hunter. I am not a Hunter.

1609
00:53:51,237 --> 00:53:53,388
Jong Kook isn't a Hunter.

1610
00:53:53,906 --> 00:53:56,629
(Who is the other Hunter besides Jung Seok?)

1611
00:53:56,676 --> 00:53:59,646
Since a Hunter completed a mission, we will pick the number again.

1612
00:53:59,647 --> 00:54:01,515
If they succeed again, the Hunters will escape.

1613
00:54:01,516 --> 00:54:02,975
That's right. Then it will be the end.

1614
00:54:03,087 --> 00:54:05,155
I don't care about the Hunters. I am going to escape.

1615
00:54:05,156 --> 00:54:06,856
We will pick the ball again.

1616
00:54:06,857 --> 00:54:09,885
(The Hunter's number is 24.)

1617
00:54:10,127 --> 00:54:14,396
I will send the number via text message to the Hunters.

1618
00:54:14,397 --> 00:54:16,396
If you have the number, you can attempt the mission right away.

1619
00:54:16,397 --> 00:54:18,666
If you don't have the number, you need to work for it.

1620
00:54:18,667 --> 00:54:20,370
It all depends on how much you work for it.

1621
00:54:20,467 --> 00:54:23,405
The final mission that will help you to get cards and escape...

1622
00:54:23,406 --> 00:54:25,141
is the Card Escape Show.

1623
00:54:25,937 --> 00:54:28,106
Currently, four exits remain.

1624
00:54:28,107 --> 00:54:30,932
(Exit 2 has been closed.)

1625
00:54:30,976 --> 00:54:33,515
There are 1 to 4 number cards hidden...

1626
00:54:33,516 --> 00:54:35,526
throughout the building.

1627
00:54:36,687 --> 00:54:38,285
If you get the card you want,

1628
00:54:38,286 --> 00:54:41,026
you can exchange it with one of your cards.

1629
00:54:41,027 --> 00:54:42,760
(Exchange it with one of your cards.)

1630
00:54:42,786 --> 00:54:45,510
If you remove the name tag of a member,

1631
00:54:45,656 --> 00:54:48,865
you can check his or her cards and exchange one with yours.

1632
00:54:48,866 --> 00:54:51,035
If you don't like the choices, you can keep your cards.

1633
00:54:51,036 --> 00:54:52,365
- Okay. - My goodness.

1634
00:54:52,366 --> 00:54:54,666
Removing the name tag doesn't eliminate the member.

1635
00:54:54,667 --> 00:54:57,075
Said member can put it back on after the exchange.

1636
00:54:57,076 --> 00:54:59,776
If you think someone is a Hunter,

1637
00:54:59,777 --> 00:55:01,445
you can remove his or her name tag...

1638
00:55:01,446 --> 00:55:03,075
and check using the judging stand by the Hunter Door.

1639
00:55:03,076 --> 00:55:04,075
Who could be the Hunters?

1640
00:55:04,076 --> 00:55:05,416
If that person is a Hunter, he or she is out,

1641
00:55:05,417 --> 00:55:06,745
and the member who removed the name tag can escape.

1642
00:55:06,746 --> 00:55:08,686
If not, the member who removed the name tag is out...

1643
00:55:08,687 --> 00:55:11,885
and an additional light will come on at the Hunter's door.

1644
00:55:11,886 --> 00:55:13,015
(An additional light will come on at the Hunter's door.)

1645
00:55:13,016 --> 00:55:15,555
If one of the Hunters succeeds to escape...

1646
00:55:15,556 --> 00:55:18,381
or both Hunters are out, the race ends.

1647
00:55:18,757 --> 00:55:21,666
- Move to the location of the race. - Let's go.

1648
00:55:21,667 --> 00:55:24,625
Let's do this. Where do we need to go?

1649
00:55:25,737 --> 00:55:28,491
I think I have the biggest sum.

1650
00:55:28,567 --> 00:55:31,236
If I see the numbers on their backs, Haha's 17 is the highest.

1651
00:55:31,237 --> 00:55:33,175
(Haha's number is the highest at 17.)

1652
00:55:33,176 --> 00:55:36,746
Unless the rest of the numbers he has...

1653
00:55:36,777 --> 00:55:40,825
are above 30...

1654
00:55:41,886 --> 00:55:44,515
Yoon A has 22 on her back. I will remove her name tag...

1655
00:55:44,516 --> 00:55:46,586
and get 4 digits of 2.

1656
00:55:46,587 --> 00:55:48,729
Then I will go...

1657
00:55:49,257 --> 00:55:51,756
to the exit that requires four of the same number.

1658
00:55:51,757 --> 00:55:54,011
(He plans to escape with 4 of the same number.)

1659
00:55:54,226 --> 00:55:56,836
I wish I had a clue on the Hunters' identities.

1660
00:55:56,837 --> 00:55:57,865
(The members who can't meet the conditions for the exits...)

1661
00:55:57,866 --> 00:56:00,365
(aim to escape by removing a Hunter's name tag.)

1662
00:56:00,366 --> 00:56:02,784
I have no idea who the Hunters are.

1663
00:56:03,576 --> 00:56:06,290
Jeon So Min. So Min.

1664
00:56:06,676 --> 00:56:09,376
Where is So Min? She has to be a Hunter.

1665
00:56:09,377 --> 00:56:10,498
(Is So Min a Hunter?)

1666
00:56:10,777 --> 00:56:14,490
Who are the Hunters? I am suspicious of Yoon A.

1667
00:56:15,417 --> 00:56:18,756
(Did Yoon A come late because she received missions?)

1668
00:56:18,757 --> 00:56:22,224
Aren't the Hunters Yoon A and Jung Seok?

1669
00:56:22,857 --> 00:56:24,925
(Meanwhile, Hunter Jung Seok...)

1670
00:56:24,926 --> 00:56:26,566
Hold on.

1671
00:56:26,567 --> 00:56:27,566
(He needs to get 24 and complete the jjajangmyeon mission.)

1672
00:56:27,567 --> 00:56:28,666
Number 24.

1673
00:56:28,667 --> 00:56:31,625
(The Hunter's number is 24.)

1674
00:56:31,696 --> 00:56:34,566
The Hunter's number is 24,

1675
00:56:34,567 --> 00:56:36,505
but I don't know who has it.

1676
00:56:36,676 --> 00:56:37,836
I will have to remove everyone's name tag.

1677
00:56:37,837 --> 00:56:40,106
(Will the Hunters be able to get Jae Seok's 24?)

1678
00:56:40,107 --> 00:56:42,376
Let's begin the race.

1679
00:56:42,377 --> 00:56:44,376
(The members who are out or fail to escape...)

1680
00:56:44,377 --> 00:56:46,376
(must pay for the expenses at Good Place.)

1681
00:56:46,377 --> 00:56:50,385
(They must catch a Hunter or escape in order to avoid paying.)

1682
00:56:50,386 --> 00:56:52,294
(The race starts.)

1683
00:56:53,886 --> 00:56:55,155
Hold on.

1684
00:56:55,156 --> 00:56:56,756
(The Hunters gather as soon as the race starts.)

1685
00:56:56,757 --> 00:56:58,555
(How about we do this?)

1686
00:56:58,556 --> 00:57:01,352
(Let's call the manager and order jjajangmyeon.)

1687
00:57:02,027 --> 00:57:03,365
(How many jjajangmyeon should we order?)

1688
00:57:03,366 --> 00:57:04,661
(Just in case, let's order 5.)

1689
00:57:05,996 --> 00:57:09,466
(That's a good idea. If you get 24,)

1690
00:57:09,467 --> 00:57:12,740
(I will eat jjajangmyeon at the gate.)

1691
00:57:13,507 --> 00:57:17,454
(This Hunter will eat jjajangmyeon. What is this plan?)

1692
00:57:18,047 --> 00:57:20,362
I will give this a try.

1693
00:57:21,147 --> 00:57:22,982
I need to hurry up.

1694
00:57:24,257 --> 00:57:27,011
(He runs to the exit for the biggest sum.)

1695
00:57:27,826 --> 00:57:30,141
(He arrives at Exit 1.)

1696
00:57:30,957 --> 00:57:32,825
Please check my numbers. I will give this a try.

1697
00:57:32,826 --> 00:57:37,166
I have 38, 32, and 21.

1698
00:57:37,167 --> 00:57:41,186
Jong Kook, the sum of your numbers...

1699
00:57:42,306 --> 00:57:47,376
(Will Jong Kook be able to escape with the biggest sum?)

1700
00:57:47,377 --> 00:57:48,405
isn't the biggest.

1701
00:57:48,406 --> 00:57:50,558
(His 91 isn't the biggest sum.)

1702
00:57:50,817 --> 00:57:52,046
(I don't have the biggest sum?)

1703
00:57:52,047 --> 00:57:53,385
I am so annoyed.

1704
00:57:53,386 --> 00:57:57,155
You will be taken to the Bad Place right away.

1705
00:57:57,156 --> 00:57:58,819
Are you sure I don't have the biggest sum?

1706
00:57:59,016 --> 00:58:00,996
(Who has the biggest sum?)

1707
00:58:02,087 --> 00:58:03,155
(When Jong Kook was headed to the exit,)

1708
00:58:03,156 --> 00:58:04,155
Are you serious?

1709
00:58:04,156 --> 00:58:05,195
(Just a moment ago, Seok Jin ran into So Min.)

1710
00:58:05,196 --> 00:58:06,583
(Ripping)

1711
00:58:07,266 --> 00:58:10,091
(Seok Jin removed So Min's name tag.)

1712
00:58:10,167 --> 00:58:11,195
I got it.

1713
00:58:11,196 --> 00:58:13,296
(Seok Jin could check her numbers and make an exchange.)

1714
00:58:13,297 --> 00:58:15,786
Let's see your numbers.

1715
00:58:17,676 --> 00:58:20,276
I am sorry, So Min. I have a plan.

1716
00:58:20,277 --> 00:58:21,532
This one.

1717
00:58:22,207 --> 00:58:23,206
All right.

1718
00:58:23,207 --> 00:58:25,146
Now, the sum of my numbers is 101.

1719
00:58:25,147 --> 00:58:26,175
(The sum of Seok Jin's numbers is 101.)

1720
00:58:26,176 --> 00:58:29,919
Let's escape. I have the biggest sum.

1721
00:58:30,587 --> 00:58:33,015
Where is the exit? What is this?

1722
00:58:33,016 --> 00:58:34,026
(He was looking for the exit...)

1723
00:58:34,027 --> 00:58:36,536
(when he finds it right in front of him.)

1724
00:58:37,457 --> 00:58:39,456
(He is about to escape.)

1725
00:58:39,457 --> 00:58:40,865
Where are you going?

1726
00:58:40,866 --> 00:58:42,495
(Jae Seok comes out of nowhere.)

1727
00:58:42,496 --> 00:58:44,095
What? Why?

1728
00:58:44,096 --> 00:58:46,411
(He gets caught by Jae Seok in front of the exit.)

1729
00:58:46,536 --> 00:58:47,635
- Where are you going? - Why?

1730
00:58:47,636 --> 00:58:48,688
Are you going to escape?

1731
00:58:48,766 --> 00:58:49,786
No.

1732
00:58:49,937 --> 00:58:52,575
Don't be like that. I don't have anything you need.

1733
00:58:52,576 --> 00:58:53,945
I think you do.

1734
00:58:53,946 --> 00:58:55,106
I need a number.

1735
00:58:55,107 --> 00:58:57,932
Hold on. I need to escape with the biggest sum.

1736
00:58:59,047 --> 00:59:00,845
Hold on. I just need to exit...

1737
00:59:00,846 --> 00:59:02,825
through that door!

1738
00:59:02,946 --> 00:59:05,874
- Okay. - You leave me with no choice.

1739
00:59:05,886 --> 00:59:08,099
(Ripping)

1740
00:59:08,656 --> 00:59:09,655
(Jae Seok removed Seok Jin's name tag.)

1741
00:59:09,656 --> 00:59:11,084
You jerk!

1742
00:59:11,397 --> 00:59:13,813
(You jerk!)

1743
00:59:14,127 --> 00:59:16,747
All right. Show me your cards.

1744
00:59:16,996 --> 00:59:19,365
Give me this one.

1745
00:59:19,366 --> 00:59:21,006
Why would you take 40?

1746
00:59:21,007 --> 00:59:23,627
(Seok Jin is frustrated.)

1747
00:59:24,076 --> 00:59:26,475
(I am trying to keep you from escaping.)

1748
00:59:26,476 --> 00:59:27,732
You little...

1749
00:59:27,777 --> 00:59:29,479
Why would you take 40?

1750
00:59:29,507 --> 00:59:32,403
Why would you do that? For goodness' sake.

1751
00:59:32,676 --> 00:59:34,379
I will need to remove someone's name tag.

1752
00:59:35,047 --> 00:59:38,963
He took 40. For goodness' sake. I knew this would happen.

1753
00:59:40,687 --> 00:59:41,707
My goodness.

1754
00:59:42,786 --> 00:59:43,995
- Jong Kook. - Yes?

1755
00:59:43,996 --> 00:59:45,996
Where do I go? Here?

1756
00:59:46,357 --> 00:59:48,666
Yes. You have arrived at the Bad Place.

1757
00:59:48,667 --> 00:59:49,765
(There is a clear divider between them.)

1758
00:59:49,766 --> 00:59:52,095
What am I supposed to do here? Is this paradise and the underworld?

1759
00:59:52,096 --> 00:59:56,466
You can watch Se Chan enjoy Good Place.

1760
00:59:56,467 --> 00:59:57,598
For goodness' sake.

1761
00:59:58,877 --> 01:00:00,146
Why did you do that?

1762
01:00:00,147 --> 01:00:01,778
(Jong Kook, why did you do that?)

1763
01:00:02,476 --> 01:00:04,675
I told you not to do that.

1764
01:00:04,676 --> 01:00:05,776
(Se Chan feels bad for Jong Kook during the visit.)

1765
01:00:05,777 --> 01:00:08,336
You shouldn't have been so obsessed with the numbers.

1766
01:00:08,647 --> 01:00:10,350
I will give you some coffee. Come over here.

1767
01:00:10,687 --> 01:00:12,385
You should suck on some coffee.

1768
01:00:12,386 --> 01:00:13,416
Do you think I am in prison?

1769
01:00:13,417 --> 01:00:15,885
(Do you think I am in prison?)

1770
01:00:15,886 --> 01:00:17,856
Is there a smaller straw?

1771
01:00:17,857 --> 01:00:19,655
- What? - Is there a narrower straw?

1772
01:00:19,656 --> 01:00:21,808
(This is like "Prison Playbook".)

1773
01:00:22,726 --> 01:00:24,164
Are you seriously doing this?

1774
01:00:24,337 --> 01:00:25,336
Drink.

1775
01:00:25,337 --> 01:00:26,495
(He enjoys a sweet sip of coffee.)

1776
01:00:26,496 --> 01:00:27,527
Are you getting it?

1777
01:00:27,806 --> 01:00:30,035
(It's really tasty.)

1778
01:00:30,036 --> 01:00:31,776
- Is it good? - It's tasty.

1779
01:00:31,777 --> 01:00:32,836
It's tasty, right?

1780
01:00:32,837 --> 01:00:33,968
(He soothes his heart with the sweet coffee.)

1781
01:00:34,507 --> 01:00:35,845
I will be out soon.

1782
01:00:35,846 --> 01:00:37,175
(I will be out soon.)

1783
01:00:37,176 --> 01:00:38,776
- Make sure you come out. - I will be out soon.

1784
01:00:38,777 --> 01:00:40,115
- It's paradise over here. - Okay.

1785
01:00:40,116 --> 01:00:41,486
Don't hit anyone in there.

1786
01:00:41,487 --> 01:00:42,812
(Then you will get a heavier sentence.)

1787
01:00:44,656 --> 01:00:45,676
Hello.

1788
01:00:46,386 --> 01:00:48,672
Call a Chinese restaurant...

1789
01:00:49,286 --> 01:00:52,655
and order five jjajangmyeon.

1790
01:00:52,656 --> 01:00:55,365
(He asks his manager to order jjajangmyeon as planned.)

1791
01:00:55,366 --> 01:00:57,304
(He finishes ordering jjajangmyeon.)

1792
01:00:57,996 --> 01:01:00,405
(He just needs to find 24, the Hunter's number.)

1793
01:01:00,406 --> 01:01:01,458
Let's go.

1794
01:01:01,967 --> 01:01:04,048
(Kwang Soo is in search of Yoon A since she has 22.)

1795
01:01:04,277 --> 01:01:07,132
I need to find Yoon A. Yoon A.

1796
01:01:07,147 --> 01:01:08,228
Yoon A.

1797
01:01:09,007 --> 01:01:10,376
(What is that sound? I don't see Yoon A.)

1798
01:01:10,377 --> 01:01:11,845
It's the sound from the audio team.

1799
01:01:11,846 --> 01:01:14,703
Gosh, that startled me.

1800
01:01:15,187 --> 01:01:16,543
You can hear everything from here.

1801
01:01:17,286 --> 01:01:18,756
- I mean... - Why do you...

1802
01:01:18,757 --> 01:01:20,586
- It's not like that. - Come here.

1803
01:01:20,587 --> 01:01:23,256
- No. - Come here.

1804
01:01:23,257 --> 01:01:24,582
I don't hear Yoon A's voice.

1805
01:01:25,426 --> 01:01:27,262
Can you turn up the volume for Yoon A's voice?

1806
01:01:27,866 --> 01:01:30,009
Yoon A's voice. I didn't know about this.

1807
01:01:30,266 --> 01:01:31,828
Can you turn up the volume for Yoon A's voice?

1808
01:01:32,136 --> 01:01:35,879
Numbers 20, 21... Any numbers in the 20s will do.

1809
01:01:36,007 --> 01:01:37,475
"Any numbers in the 20s will do."

1810
01:01:37,476 --> 01:01:39,405
I need to get two numbers in the 20s.

1811
01:01:39,406 --> 01:01:41,405
(Kwang Soo gets an idea of Yoon A's numbers.)

1812
01:01:41,406 --> 01:01:43,416
She doesn't have any numbers with 2 besides 22.

1813
01:01:43,576 --> 01:01:45,475
What does Haha have?

1814
01:01:45,476 --> 01:01:47,180
"What does Haha have?"

1815
01:01:47,386 --> 01:01:48,977
She must have met Haha.

1816
01:01:49,846 --> 01:01:51,315
She must have met Haha.

1817
01:01:51,487 --> 01:01:52,507
Thank you.

1818
01:01:52,786 --> 01:01:53,856
She must have met Haha.

1819
01:01:53,857 --> 01:01:55,986
(Hey!)

1820
01:01:55,987 --> 01:01:58,506
(Yoon A appears before his eyes.)

1821
01:01:58,696 --> 01:02:00,765
- My goodness. - You are scary.

1822
01:02:00,766 --> 01:02:02,225
- Yoon A! - What?

1823
01:02:02,226 --> 01:02:04,035
I got goosebumps.

1824
01:02:04,036 --> 01:02:05,566
You were there just now. When did you...

1825
01:02:05,567 --> 01:02:06,736
- What? - Yoon A.

1826
01:02:06,737 --> 01:02:08,847
- Yoon A. - What is going on?

1827
01:02:09,036 --> 01:02:10,736
- Yoon A, I am sorry. - You are a Hunter, right?

1828
01:02:10,737 --> 01:02:12,511
- You are a Hunter, right? - What? I am not a Hunter.

1829
01:02:12,777 --> 01:02:15,075
- I heard that... - Okay.

1830
01:02:15,076 --> 01:02:18,208
you need 2 numbers with 2.

1831
01:02:18,217 --> 01:02:19,646
- Really? - Yes.

1832
01:02:19,647 --> 01:02:20,686
That must be the case with you.

1833
01:02:20,687 --> 01:02:21,707
So...

1834
01:02:22,116 --> 01:02:23,819
That must be the case with you.

1835
01:02:24,386 --> 01:02:25,686
(Ji Hyo suddenly appears.)

1836
01:02:25,687 --> 01:02:26,707
What are you doing?

1837
01:02:27,487 --> 01:02:28,586
I am watching.

1838
01:02:28,587 --> 01:02:29,686
Ji Hyo,

1839
01:02:29,687 --> 01:02:32,356
two lions could lose a deer by fighting over it.

1840
01:02:32,357 --> 01:02:33,626
What are you saying?

1841
01:02:33,627 --> 01:02:35,125
You have somewhere else to be, right?

1842
01:02:35,667 --> 01:02:37,195
- I... - This is my last chance.

1843
01:02:37,196 --> 01:02:38,236
(This lion is desperate.)

1844
01:02:38,237 --> 01:02:40,506
If I don't get this number, I need to pay.

1845
01:02:40,507 --> 01:02:43,006
Both of you want to remove my name tag!

1846
01:02:43,007 --> 01:02:44,231
Go ahead.

1847
01:02:44,377 --> 01:02:46,518
(The desperate lion attacks the deer.)

1848
01:02:47,207 --> 01:02:49,623
(Will the deer become the lion's prey?)

1849
01:02:50,877 --> 01:02:51,897
I got it!

1850
01:02:53,047 --> 01:02:55,260
(Kwang Soo succeeded in removing Yoon A's name tag.)

1851
01:02:55,886 --> 01:02:58,586
So you removed my name tag. What do you want?

1852
01:02:58,587 --> 01:02:59,856
Give me the number on your back.

1853
01:02:59,857 --> 01:03:01,182
- The number on my back? - Yes.

1854
01:03:01,286 --> 01:03:02,825
What will you give me?

1855
01:03:02,826 --> 01:03:04,195
I will give you the number on my back.

1856
01:03:04,196 --> 01:03:05,495
(I will give you the number on my back.)

1857
01:03:05,496 --> 01:03:06,853
- The number on your back? - Yes.

1858
01:03:08,127 --> 01:03:09,865
For goodness' sake.

1859
01:03:09,866 --> 01:03:11,635
I don't know what it is, but I will give it to you.

1860
01:03:11,636 --> 01:03:14,006
- You are too much! - Give me your number.

1861
01:03:14,007 --> 01:03:15,129
What is it?

1862
01:03:15,366 --> 01:03:16,566
(Kwang Soo exchanges 1 with 22.)

1863
01:03:16,567 --> 01:03:18,780
Thank you. I will leave now.

1864
01:03:19,237 --> 01:03:22,205
I hope you escape safely.

1865
01:03:22,676 --> 01:03:24,991
There is something I am aiming for too.

1866
01:03:25,746 --> 01:03:27,216
(What is Yoon A aiming for?)

1867
01:03:27,217 --> 01:03:28,385
- Yoon A. - Yes?

1868
01:03:28,386 --> 01:03:29,846
Let me see your back.

1869
01:03:30,016 --> 01:03:32,465
Let me see your back.

1870
01:03:32,786 --> 01:03:34,486
- Gosh. - Let me see your back.

1871
01:03:34,487 --> 01:03:36,322
(They show each other the numbers on their backs.)

1872
01:03:37,056 --> 01:03:40,086
We don't want each other's number.

1873
01:03:40,496 --> 01:03:42,873
(Ji Hyo watches them.)

1874
01:03:43,366 --> 01:03:44,865
(They are the strong Hunter candidates.)

1875
01:03:44,866 --> 01:03:46,265
Jung Seok, who are you looking for?

1876
01:03:46,266 --> 01:03:47,837
(Screaming)

1877
01:03:48,136 --> 01:03:49,236
Who are you looking for?

1878
01:03:49,237 --> 01:03:52,501
(He looks towards Ji Hyo then suddenly attacks Yoon A.)

1879
01:03:53,846 --> 01:03:56,506
(He attacks suddenly as soon as he sees Ji Hyo.)

1880
01:03:56,507 --> 01:03:58,617
- There's one more. - Stop it.

1881
01:04:01,616 --> 01:04:03,453
(Tearing)

1882
01:04:03,857 --> 01:04:04,885
Okay.

1883
01:04:04,886 --> 01:04:06,716
(Hunter Jung Seok tears off Yoon A's name tag.)

1884
01:04:06,717 --> 01:04:07,856
All right.

1885
01:04:07,857 --> 01:04:09,325
Let me see your cards.

1886
01:04:09,326 --> 01:04:10,655
- You want to see my cards? - Yes.

1887
01:04:10,656 --> 01:04:12,655
(Is their goal exchanging cards?)

1888
01:04:12,656 --> 01:04:14,808
(Or are they acting because they're hunters?)

1889
01:04:14,996 --> 01:04:17,135
(Kwang Soo tried to get four of the same number.)

1890
01:04:17,136 --> 01:04:20,236
(As people take off each other's name tags, he fails to escape.)

1891
01:04:20,237 --> 01:04:23,876
(Jae Seok has 11, 23, 40, and Kwang Soo has 22, 24, and 37.)

1892
01:04:23,877 --> 01:04:25,100
I will exchange this...

1893
01:04:25,437 --> 01:04:26,675
with the one I have on my back.

1894
01:04:26,676 --> 01:04:28,002
- That one? - Yes.

1895
01:04:28,076 --> 01:04:29,646
(How many times has he exchanged?)

1896
01:04:29,647 --> 01:04:30,840
Take it.

1897
01:04:30,917 --> 01:04:33,276
(Number that will be on Jae Seok's back)

1898
01:04:33,277 --> 01:04:35,285
Do I have to put one of mine in there?

1899
01:04:36,147 --> 01:04:39,013
(Hunter's number 24)

1900
01:04:40,087 --> 01:04:43,147
(No one knows about it except the Hunters.)

1901
01:04:43,187 --> 01:04:45,026
I'm still chasing after number 24.

1902
01:04:45,027 --> 01:04:47,342
(Hunter Jung Seok is still chasing after number 24.)

1903
01:04:48,426 --> 01:04:50,265
(The Hunter number appeared.)

1904
01:04:50,266 --> 01:04:51,796
I'll get going.

1905
01:04:52,067 --> 01:04:55,504
(Will the Hunters be able to steal Jae Seok's number 24?)

1906
01:04:57,437 --> 01:05:00,946
The Hunter's number is 24.

1907
01:05:01,777 --> 01:05:05,825
(Number 24 is on Jae Seok's back.)

1908
01:05:06,846 --> 01:05:10,254
(The Hunters realized where the Hunter's number is.)

1909
01:05:10,786 --> 01:05:13,235
(Jae Seok becomes the Hunters' target.)

1910
01:05:13,957 --> 01:05:15,026
Where is Jae Seok?

1911
01:05:15,027 --> 01:05:16,655
(If he clears the jjajangmyeon mission,)

1912
01:05:16,656 --> 01:05:17,655
(he can escape.)

1913
01:05:17,656 --> 01:05:19,195
Have you seen Jae Seok?

1914
01:05:19,196 --> 01:05:21,796
(Hunter candidates become busy.)

1915
01:05:21,797 --> 01:05:24,622
Where's Jae Seok?

1916
01:05:24,766 --> 01:05:25,966
Where am I right now?

1917
01:05:25,967 --> 01:05:27,836
(Yoon A also looks for Jae Seok all of a sudden.)

1918
01:05:27,837 --> 01:05:29,865
(What?)

1919
01:05:29,866 --> 01:05:31,876
Jae Seok. Jae Seok.

1920
01:05:33,136 --> 01:05:35,006
(Is Yoon A calling me?)

1921
01:05:35,007 --> 01:05:36,146
Is that Jae Seok?

1922
01:05:36,147 --> 01:05:37,876
(She checks that the one faraway is Jae Seok.)

1923
01:05:37,877 --> 01:05:39,515
It's Jae Seok. Jae Seok.

1924
01:05:39,516 --> 01:05:41,745
(She takes big steps towards Jae Seok.)

1925
01:05:41,746 --> 01:05:44,337
(Then she starts to run towards him.)

1926
01:05:44,886 --> 01:05:47,325
(Hunter Jung Seok who is chasing after Jae Seok)

1927
01:05:47,326 --> 01:05:48,325
Where should I go?

1928
01:05:48,326 --> 01:05:49,612
- Jae Seok. - Wait.

1929
01:05:49,726 --> 01:05:51,925
(Jae Seok senses danger and runs away.)

1930
01:05:51,926 --> 01:05:52,978
Jae Seok.

1931
01:05:54,326 --> 01:05:57,224
(Hunter Jung Seok chases right after Jae Seok.)

1932
01:05:59,096 --> 01:06:01,585
(He goes back inside the stadium where there's nowhere to hide.)

1933
01:06:02,107 --> 01:06:05,475
(He gives all his might to run away.)

1934
01:06:05,476 --> 01:06:07,575
(However, he remains in the hands of Jung Seok.)

1935
01:06:07,576 --> 01:06:08,805
There's no way to go down.

1936
01:06:08,806 --> 01:06:10,075
(He's flustered.)

1937
01:06:10,076 --> 01:06:11,316
There's no way to go down.

1938
01:06:11,317 --> 01:06:12,376
What do I do?

1939
01:06:12,377 --> 01:06:14,586
(At the moment he's looking for a way out,)

1940
01:06:14,587 --> 01:06:15,686
Don't worry.

1941
01:06:15,687 --> 01:06:18,675
(he's caught by Haha.)

1942
01:06:19,987 --> 01:06:21,756
(At that time)

1943
01:06:21,757 --> 01:06:22,956
(Tearing)

1944
01:06:22,957 --> 01:06:24,095
He tore it.

1945
01:06:24,096 --> 01:06:25,524
(Kwang Soo tears off Haha's name tag.)

1946
01:06:25,757 --> 01:06:27,562
(Name tags keep getting torn off.)

1947
01:06:27,667 --> 01:06:29,054
Two of you can fight.

1948
01:06:29,596 --> 01:06:30,657
What is it?

1949
01:06:30,766 --> 01:06:32,865
What about these two?

1950
01:06:32,866 --> 01:06:35,806
(Haha gets 11, and Kwang Soo gets 29.)

1951
01:06:35,807 --> 01:06:37,061
I could have defended this way.

1952
01:06:37,436 --> 01:06:38,735
You got all of them.

1953
01:06:38,736 --> 01:06:40,266
(Kwang Soo collects 4 of the same number.)

1954
01:06:40,547 --> 01:06:41,700
Have a seat.

1955
01:06:42,007 --> 01:06:43,128
Wait.

1956
01:06:43,276 --> 01:06:45,176
- Wait. - Actually...

1957
01:06:45,177 --> 01:06:46,315
(He looks for a chance to tear of Jae Seok's name tag.)

1958
01:06:46,316 --> 01:06:48,019
Do you know what numbers you have on your back?

1959
01:06:48,047 --> 01:06:49,240
- What? - Can you tell me?

1960
01:06:49,286 --> 01:06:50,485
(Yoon A shows interest in Jae Seok's numbers.)

1961
01:06:50,486 --> 01:06:51,485
Listen.

1962
01:06:51,486 --> 01:06:53,659
- You're irrelevant. - I know.

1963
01:06:54,057 --> 01:06:55,964
About the name tags...

1964
01:06:56,156 --> 01:06:57,155
Wait.

1965
01:06:57,156 --> 01:06:58,217
(At that moment)

1966
01:06:58,597 --> 01:07:00,605
(Tearing)

1967
01:07:01,097 --> 01:07:03,495
(Jung Seok tears off Jae Seok's name tag.)

1968
01:07:03,496 --> 01:07:05,026
My goodness.

1969
01:07:05,496 --> 01:07:07,710
Change my number with the number on his back.

1970
01:07:09,866 --> 01:07:11,235
Goodness.

1971
01:07:11,236 --> 01:07:12,256
(Hunter Jung Seok has only one goal.)

1972
01:07:13,137 --> 01:07:15,245
(He finally obtains the Hunter's number.)

1973
01:07:15,246 --> 01:07:16,502
You should get out.

1974
01:07:18,177 --> 01:07:20,046
(With the Hunter's number, he can clear the hidden mission.)

1975
01:07:20,047 --> 01:07:21,285
Tell me the location.

1976
01:07:21,286 --> 01:07:22,546
(He finds out where jjajangmyeon is located.)

1977
01:07:22,547 --> 01:07:23,709
I got it.

1978
01:07:24,457 --> 01:07:25,615
(He succeeds if he eats jjajangmyeon secretly.)

1979
01:07:25,616 --> 01:07:26,780
The main gate.

1980
01:07:27,087 --> 01:07:28,325
Let's go.

1981
01:07:28,326 --> 01:07:30,226
(Let's go eat jjajangmyeon.)

1982
01:07:30,227 --> 01:07:34,275
(Will he clear the last hidden mission and escape successfully?)

1983
01:07:35,127 --> 01:07:36,266
We need to catch him.

1984
01:07:36,267 --> 01:07:39,266
(Kwang Soo obtains 4 of the same number.)

1985
01:07:39,267 --> 01:07:41,449
"The one with four of the same number".

1986
01:07:42,436 --> 01:07:44,235
(Among hidden numbers)

1987
01:07:44,236 --> 01:07:45,359
It's 37.

1988
01:07:45,477 --> 01:07:47,206
(He obtains number 37.)

1989
01:07:47,207 --> 01:07:49,113
It's 37. Let's get out.

1990
01:07:49,347 --> 01:07:50,445
What's this?

1991
01:07:50,446 --> 01:07:53,302
(He has the highest sum of the numbers.)

1992
01:07:53,717 --> 01:07:55,175
Okay, I got out.

1993
01:07:56,347 --> 01:07:58,086
(Only 2 doors remain to escape.)

1994
01:07:58,087 --> 01:07:59,514
(Multiple of 5 Door and Hunter's door)

1995
01:08:00,257 --> 01:08:03,155
Those who can't escape, let's catch the Hunters.

1996
01:08:03,156 --> 01:08:04,452
I have no way to escape.

1997
01:08:05,097 --> 01:08:06,655
- Aren't you a Hunter? - Pardon?

1998
01:08:06,656 --> 01:08:08,156
- Aren't you? - No.

1999
01:08:08,196 --> 01:08:09,319
Aren't you a Hunter?

2000
01:08:10,127 --> 01:08:11,391
I swear that I'm not.

2001
01:08:11,436 --> 01:08:13,296
- Aren't you a Hunter? - It's definitely not me.

2002
01:08:13,297 --> 01:08:15,235
- I always thought it was you. - It's definitely not me.

2003
01:08:15,236 --> 01:08:16,636
I swear that I'm not.

2004
01:08:16,637 --> 01:08:18,645
Okay, I'll let you pass.

2005
01:08:18,936 --> 01:08:20,406
- You know that I'm not, right? - Okay.

2006
01:08:20,847 --> 01:08:22,641
What's this? Can we eat it?

2007
01:08:23,646 --> 01:08:25,615
(Why is there jjajangmyeon?)

2008
01:08:25,616 --> 01:08:27,445
- Is it for a Hunter? - Jjajangmyeon.

2009
01:08:27,446 --> 01:08:29,346
This is a mission for the Hunters.

2010
01:08:29,347 --> 01:08:30,744
"Eat jjajangmyeon".

2011
01:08:31,087 --> 01:08:33,716
(Why is it here?)

2012
01:08:33,717 --> 01:08:34,855
There it is.

2013
01:08:34,856 --> 01:08:36,928
(Jung Seok goes to look for jjajangmyeon.)

2014
01:08:37,186 --> 01:08:39,556
(He discovers jjajangmyeon.)

2015
01:08:39,557 --> 01:08:42,495
(Jjajangmyeon was placed in various places.)

2016
01:08:42,496 --> 01:08:46,395
(He leaves jjajangmyeon as bait and obtains it elsewhere.)

2017
01:08:46,396 --> 01:08:47,998
I should take it away.

2018
01:08:48,167 --> 01:08:50,003
- Are you a Hunter? - I'm not.

2019
01:08:50,036 --> 01:08:52,876
Let's just eat it. Come here.

2020
01:08:52,877 --> 01:08:54,206
(Just eat it?)

2021
01:08:54,207 --> 01:08:55,370
I'm not it.

2022
01:08:55,977 --> 01:08:58,846
(During the Hunters' strategy meeting a moment ago...)

2023
01:08:58,847 --> 01:09:00,784
(I'll eat it in front of the door.)

2024
01:09:01,146 --> 01:09:04,355
(Another Hunter intends to eat jjajangmyeon openly.)

2025
01:09:04,356 --> 01:09:08,126
(Was the strategy to draw attention?)

2026
01:09:08,127 --> 01:09:11,796
(Does that mean So Min is the other Hunter?)

2027
01:09:11,797 --> 01:09:13,051
It's so delicious.

2028
01:09:13,196 --> 01:09:17,042
(So Min's behavior is suspicious in many ways.)

2029
01:09:17,436 --> 01:09:18,495
(So Min's action draws attention.)

2030
01:09:18,496 --> 01:09:19,690
Haha.

2031
01:09:20,167 --> 01:09:21,493
- Haha. - Yes.

2032
01:09:21,606 --> 01:09:23,006
So Min is a Hunter.

2033
01:09:23,007 --> 01:09:24,405
She's eating jjajangmyeon.

2034
01:09:24,406 --> 01:09:25,529
(Was it So Min and Jung Seok's plan?)

2035
01:09:26,576 --> 01:09:27,945
She's a Hunter.

2036
01:09:27,946 --> 01:09:29,405
(Is So Min the other Hunter?)

2037
01:09:29,406 --> 01:09:31,354
- She's a Hunter. - Isn't she?

2038
01:09:33,076 --> 01:09:34,269
So Min.

2039
01:09:34,717 --> 01:09:36,011
Why are you eating jjajangmyeon?

2040
01:09:36,816 --> 01:09:38,016
I didn't eat any.

2041
01:09:38,017 --> 01:09:40,285
- It was to get rid of the evidence. - Only she ate it.

2042
01:09:40,286 --> 01:09:42,123
- What? - If I eat jjajangmyeon...

2043
01:09:43,427 --> 01:09:44,681
Why are you eating jjajangmyeon?

2044
01:09:45,127 --> 01:09:47,269
If I eat it, the light goes on, and the Hunter will leave.

2045
01:09:50,066 --> 01:09:53,331
(Their interrogation makes her choke.)

2046
01:09:54,667 --> 01:09:56,035
Why are you eating it?

2047
01:09:56,036 --> 01:09:57,087
To get rid of the evidence.

2048
01:09:58,137 --> 01:09:59,905
- It's to eliminate evidence. - She was eating jjajangmyeon.

2049
01:09:59,906 --> 01:10:01,176
She was eating it.

2050
01:10:01,177 --> 01:10:02,745
- This is unfair. - Tear off her name tag.

2051
01:10:02,746 --> 01:10:04,376
(At that moment)

2052
01:10:04,377 --> 01:10:06,355
Wait, I'm really not it.

2053
01:10:07,217 --> 01:10:09,225
Wait, I'm really not it.

2054
01:10:09,347 --> 01:10:11,216
- I'm not a Hunter. - Why did you eat jjajangmyeon?

2055
01:10:11,217 --> 01:10:12,386
- Hunter... - She ate it.

2056
01:10:12,387 --> 01:10:13,611
Listen, Haha.

2057
01:10:14,257 --> 01:10:16,226
(So Min is suspicious indeed.)

2058
01:10:16,227 --> 01:10:18,296
(She can be identified if her name tag is placed on the judging stand.)

2059
01:10:18,297 --> 01:10:19,525
- Seriously. - Currently,

2060
01:10:19,526 --> 01:10:21,566
- the Hunter's light didn't turn on. - See?

2061
01:10:22,866 --> 01:10:24,565
(The Hunter's light didn't come on.)

2062
01:10:24,566 --> 01:10:25,892
The light didn't turn on?

2063
01:10:26,297 --> 01:10:29,704
(Jung Seok is still eating the jjajangmyeon.)

2064
01:10:30,566 --> 01:10:31,903
See? This is evidence.

2065
01:10:32,007 --> 01:10:34,105
If the light turned because I ate this then I'm a Hunter.

2066
01:10:34,106 --> 01:10:35,306
I ate it.

2067
01:10:35,307 --> 01:10:36,346
- I believe you. - Okay.

2068
01:10:36,347 --> 01:10:38,661
I just ate it. I have evidence.

2069
01:10:38,977 --> 01:10:41,536
Then I'll eat some too.

2070
01:10:41,587 --> 01:10:43,861
Look if the light turns on or not.

2071
01:10:44,957 --> 01:10:46,815
(It's no use if the Hunter doesn't have his number.)

2072
01:10:46,816 --> 01:10:48,226
Wait, did you eat some?

2073
01:10:48,227 --> 01:10:49,410
I ate some.

2074
01:10:50,026 --> 01:10:51,655
(The light doesn't turn on since Jung Seok has the Hunter's number.)

2075
01:10:51,656 --> 01:10:52,825
Did the light turn on or not?

2076
01:10:52,826 --> 01:10:54,765
- Take a look. - I want some too.

2077
01:10:55,526 --> 01:10:57,302
- Really? - Neither of us are Hunters.

2078
01:10:57,566 --> 01:10:58,735
I ate some.

2079
01:10:58,736 --> 01:11:00,035
(The rest of them gather to eat jjajangmyeon.)

2080
01:11:00,036 --> 01:11:01,292
What's wrong?

2081
01:11:01,707 --> 01:11:04,065
Only two of the Hunter's lights are on.

2082
01:11:04,066 --> 01:11:05,127
See?

2083
01:11:06,877 --> 01:11:08,676
(4 members eat jjajangmyeon to avoid suspicion.)

2084
01:11:08,677 --> 01:11:10,105
- I'll eat some. - Wait.

2085
01:11:10,106 --> 01:11:11,216
I'm not it.

2086
01:11:11,217 --> 01:11:13,445
(Someone is acting in order to help Jung Seok.)

2087
01:11:13,446 --> 01:11:14,843
How can we find out?

2088
01:11:15,517 --> 01:11:20,617
(Which one of the 4 is a Hunter?)

2089
01:11:21,156 --> 01:11:24,726
As 3 of his cards are multiples of 5,

2090
01:11:24,856 --> 01:11:27,856
Jae Seok has escaped successfully.

2091
01:11:28,066 --> 01:11:30,126
- Jae Seok? - Did Jae Seok escape?

2092
01:11:30,127 --> 01:11:31,564
- Is it Jae Seok? - In the midst of all this?

2093
01:11:32,467 --> 01:11:34,303
(Thud)

2094
01:11:35,566 --> 01:11:38,330
(What's that sound?)

2095
01:11:39,177 --> 01:11:43,006
(He's struggling to eat jjajangmyeon without being noticed.)

2096
01:11:43,007 --> 01:11:46,341
(It's not easy being a Hunter.)

2097
01:11:46,977 --> 01:11:49,185
(It's the Hunter's last hidden mission.)

2098
01:11:49,186 --> 01:11:51,838
(He finishes eating jjajangmyeon in secret.)

2099
01:11:53,116 --> 01:11:56,452
(All of Hunter's lights are turned on.)

2100
01:11:56,686 --> 01:12:00,572
Hunters may escape through Hunter's door.

2101
01:12:00,656 --> 01:12:02,941
See? Someone cleared the mission.

2102
01:12:02,967 --> 01:12:04,126
The mission is cleared.

2103
01:12:04,127 --> 01:12:06,340
Where's the door? It's over once the Hunter goes out.

2104
01:12:06,366 --> 01:12:07,866
It's over once the Hunter goes out.

2105
01:12:08,406 --> 01:12:10,306
- I have no idea. - Hey.

2106
01:12:10,307 --> 01:12:11,806
Everyone, hold hands.

2107
01:12:11,807 --> 01:12:13,368
No one can leave.

2108
01:12:13,936 --> 01:12:15,546
(Hold hands all of a sudden?)

2109
01:12:15,547 --> 01:12:17,077
Hold hands. Hold hands.

2110
01:12:17,246 --> 01:12:19,052
Hold each other's hands.

2111
01:12:19,576 --> 01:12:21,279
Let's go over there.

2112
01:12:21,347 --> 01:12:23,516
A Hunter may be going over there.

2113
01:12:23,517 --> 01:12:26,138
(They move to the Hunter's door to block the other Hunter.)

2114
01:12:27,186 --> 01:12:28,285
Is it Jung Seok?

2115
01:12:28,286 --> 01:12:29,450
It is.

2116
01:12:29,887 --> 01:12:31,726
(They find out about one Hunter.)

2117
01:12:31,727 --> 01:12:33,429
Jung Seok will leave now.

2118
01:12:34,127 --> 01:12:36,718
(Jung Seok moves towards the Hunter's door.)

2119
01:12:36,727 --> 01:12:38,495
One of us is also a Hunter.

2120
01:12:38,496 --> 01:12:40,136
I know, but it could be you.

2121
01:12:40,137 --> 01:12:41,258
It could be you too.

2122
01:12:41,936 --> 01:12:43,035
How can you?

2123
01:12:43,036 --> 01:12:44,811
- How can you act? - How can you?

2124
01:12:45,036 --> 01:12:47,321
- Yoon A. - You're so good at acting.

2125
01:12:47,677 --> 01:12:49,506
Who is it?

2126
01:12:49,507 --> 01:12:50,846
- Seriously. - I don't know who it is,

2127
01:12:50,847 --> 01:12:52,714
- but the Hunter is good at acting. - I know.

2128
01:12:53,146 --> 01:12:54,952
- Haha. - It's the Hunter's door.

2129
01:12:55,547 --> 01:12:58,456
(They arrive in front of the Hunter's door.)

2130
01:12:58,457 --> 01:13:01,956
(Will they be able to stop the Hunters from escaping?)

2131
01:13:01,957 --> 01:13:04,680
(Jung Seok gets to the front of the Hunter's door.)

2132
01:13:06,196 --> 01:13:11,163
(He sees the members and hides himself.)

2133
01:13:12,797 --> 01:13:14,136
Isn't it you, Haha?

2134
01:13:14,137 --> 01:13:16,336
You're about to drive me crazy.

2135
01:13:16,337 --> 01:13:17,836
Are you cornering me again?

2136
01:13:17,837 --> 01:13:21,518
(How can I get out?)

2137
01:13:22,576 --> 01:13:24,945
Ji Hyo, we must decide. Let's put up someone's name tag.

2138
01:13:24,946 --> 01:13:26,916
All three lights are on.

2139
01:13:27,276 --> 01:13:29,285
- We can put someone up. - Lights are on anyway.

2140
01:13:29,286 --> 01:13:30,613
Let's play rock-paper-scissors.

2141
01:13:30,646 --> 01:13:31,738
The loser will go.

2142
01:13:31,786 --> 01:13:32,785
- Then... - Seriously.

2143
01:13:32,786 --> 01:13:34,285
you two are suspicious, so play rock-paper-scissors.

2144
01:13:34,286 --> 01:13:35,355
Listen to her.

2145
01:13:35,356 --> 01:13:36,726
Why does she keep cornering me?

2146
01:13:36,727 --> 01:13:39,104
Listen to her. Why does she keep cornering me?

2147
01:13:39,297 --> 01:13:41,643
- She keeps accusing others. - Right?

2148
01:13:42,026 --> 01:13:43,393
Seriously.

2149
01:13:44,337 --> 01:13:45,622
(Is it really unfair?)

2150
01:13:45,667 --> 01:13:46,695
(Or is she acting?)

2151
01:13:46,696 --> 01:13:48,405
Please believe me. I'm not a Hunter.

2152
01:13:48,406 --> 01:13:50,806
You can post the photo of me as Yondu on social media.

2153
01:13:50,807 --> 01:13:52,476
My mom wears a cotton flannel dress.

2154
01:13:52,477 --> 01:13:54,275
(My mom wears a cotton flannel dress.)

2155
01:13:54,276 --> 01:13:55,605
(A battle of Yondu and cotton flannel?)

2156
01:13:55,606 --> 01:13:57,075
You can post my Yondu photo.

2157
01:13:57,076 --> 01:13:58,645
I look like a blue egg.

2158
01:13:58,646 --> 01:14:00,575
I have one of hers.

2159
01:14:00,576 --> 01:14:02,346
I'm really not a Hunter. If I am, you can post that photo.

2160
01:14:02,347 --> 01:14:04,245
- I swear that I'm not it. - You scare me so much.

2161
01:14:04,246 --> 01:14:05,685
I swear that I'm not a hunter.

2162
01:14:05,686 --> 01:14:07,456
I swear that I'm not.

2163
01:14:07,457 --> 01:14:09,355
I'm not it.

2164
01:14:09,356 --> 01:14:11,091
If I were strong...

2165
01:14:11,326 --> 01:14:14,466
Only if I were strong... I'll exercise starting today.

2166
01:14:14,467 --> 01:14:15,895
Current price is 600 dollars.

2167
01:14:15,896 --> 01:14:17,025
That's ridiculous.

2168
01:14:17,026 --> 01:14:18,296
Current price is 600 dollars.

2169
01:14:18,297 --> 01:14:19,935
(The tab at Good Place keeps going up.)

2170
01:14:19,936 --> 01:14:21,235
Do it now. Someone should go.

2171
01:14:21,236 --> 01:14:22,905
Someone should start even if you're eliminated.

2172
01:14:22,906 --> 01:14:24,263
It increased to 640 dollars.

2173
01:14:24,677 --> 01:14:26,006
- Hurry. - Stop it.

2174
01:14:26,007 --> 01:14:27,884
Let's play rock-paper-scissors.

2175
01:14:28,047 --> 01:14:29,745
I'm really not it.

2176
01:14:29,746 --> 01:14:31,857
- Why am I doing this? - That's right.

2177
01:14:31,946 --> 01:14:33,445
Why don't we do this?

2178
01:14:33,446 --> 01:14:35,846
Jung Seok is definitely it, so let's catch him first.

2179
01:14:35,847 --> 01:14:37,386
Are you stalling for time?

2180
01:14:37,387 --> 01:14:38,655
No way!

2181
01:14:38,656 --> 01:14:40,916
(What did he say?)

2182
01:14:40,917 --> 01:14:42,126
You're crazy.

2183
01:14:42,127 --> 01:14:43,985
Look at him. I guess he isn't it.

2184
01:14:43,986 --> 01:14:45,557
- He's really not it. - You're annoying.

2185
01:14:45,757 --> 01:14:47,495
(At that time)

2186
01:14:47,496 --> 01:14:48,495
(So Min tries to take off Yoon A's name tag.)

2187
01:14:48,496 --> 01:14:49,525
You startled me.

2188
01:14:49,526 --> 01:14:51,235
(So Min tries to take off Yoon A's name tag.)

2189
01:14:51,236 --> 01:14:52,336
Isn't Yoon A?

2190
01:14:52,337 --> 01:14:54,235
I won't take off your name tag. I worried about your hair.

2191
01:14:54,236 --> 01:14:55,532
Is it her?

2192
01:14:55,767 --> 01:14:56,806
- Listen. - She's being strange.

2193
01:14:56,807 --> 01:14:58,979
- What's wrong with you? - Someone should do it.

2194
01:14:59,036 --> 01:15:01,188
(Tearing)

2195
01:15:02,307 --> 01:15:04,645
I'm really not it, Ji Hyo.

2196
01:15:04,646 --> 01:15:06,976
Ji Hyo, will you put it up for verdict or not?

2197
01:15:06,977 --> 01:15:08,046
I will.

2198
01:15:08,047 --> 01:15:10,315
(She decides to put up So Min's name tag for a verdict.)

2199
01:15:10,316 --> 01:15:11,485
If she's a Hunter, the light will turn green.

2200
01:15:11,486 --> 01:15:13,386
If not, the light will remain red.

2201
01:15:13,387 --> 01:15:15,626
(If So Min is a Hunter, the light will turn green.)

2202
01:15:15,627 --> 01:15:19,370
(If she's not a Hunter, Ji Hyo will be eliminated.)

2203
01:15:19,396 --> 01:15:20,395
So Min.

2204
01:15:20,396 --> 01:15:21,692
I'm not it.

2205
01:15:22,026 --> 01:15:24,893
(So Min's name tag goes on the judging stand.)

2206
01:15:25,996 --> 01:15:30,087
(So Min tried hard to win even by drinking salted sikhye.)

2207
01:15:31,076 --> 01:15:32,403
(Why is she doing that?)

2208
01:15:33,436 --> 01:15:37,916
(She was also the first to eat jjajangmyeon.)

2209
01:15:37,917 --> 01:15:41,185
(So Min was suspicious throughout the day.)

2210
01:15:41,186 --> 01:15:44,886
(Who is So Min?)

2211
01:15:44,887 --> 01:15:46,314
I'm not it.

2212
01:15:47,616 --> 01:15:49,355
(It turned red?)

2213
01:15:49,356 --> 01:15:51,096
(So Min isn't a Hunter.)

2214
01:15:51,097 --> 01:15:53,355
So Min is not a Hunter.

2215
01:15:53,356 --> 01:15:55,203
- Ji Hyo is eliminated. - See?

2216
01:15:55,396 --> 01:15:58,906
(So Min and Ji Hyo are not Hunters.)

2217
01:15:59,797 --> 01:16:02,724
(Yoon A and Haha remain.)

2218
01:16:03,007 --> 01:16:04,190
I'm not it.

2219
01:16:04,637 --> 01:16:06,238
I can't figure out who it is.

2220
01:16:09,007 --> 01:16:11,315
(In the first game, Yoon A exchanged numbers with Jae Seok.)

2221
01:16:11,316 --> 01:16:12,476
- You want to exchange? - Yes.

2222
01:16:12,477 --> 01:16:13,846
- With the number on my back. - On your back?

2223
01:16:13,847 --> 01:16:15,550
Seriously?

2224
01:16:16,116 --> 01:16:19,086
(The sum of Yoon A's numbers was the highest.)

2225
01:16:19,087 --> 01:16:23,778
(Instead of escaping, she chose Round 2.)

2226
01:16:24,356 --> 01:16:29,192
(Yoon A kept looking for Jae Seok. Is she a Hunter?)

2227
01:16:29,797 --> 01:16:33,296
(Haha acted suspiciously all day.)

2228
01:16:33,297 --> 01:16:36,265
(Those who can't escape, let's catch the Hunters.)

2229
01:16:36,936 --> 01:16:39,806
(Haha gave up on his numbers.)

2230
01:16:39,807 --> 01:16:41,605
(Haha gave up too early.)

2231
01:16:41,606 --> 01:16:45,216
(Did he stay in order to help the other Hunter?)

2232
01:16:45,217 --> 01:16:48,716
(Is Haha the other Hunter?)

2233
01:16:48,717 --> 01:16:49,846
I'm really not it.

2234
01:16:49,847 --> 01:16:52,132
I swear that I'm not.

2235
01:16:52,856 --> 01:16:54,825
(Jung Seok waits for his chance.)

2236
01:16:54,826 --> 01:16:56,185
I swear to you.

2237
01:16:56,186 --> 01:16:58,426
- I'm really not it. - I can't figure out who it is.

2238
01:16:58,427 --> 01:16:59,426
It's really not me.

2239
01:16:59,427 --> 01:17:00,456
(At that time)

2240
01:17:00,457 --> 01:17:04,097
(Yoon A goes after Haha's name tag.)

2241
01:17:04,536 --> 01:17:05,565
It's really not me.

2242
01:17:05,566 --> 01:17:06,565
(Haha runs away.)

2243
01:17:06,566 --> 01:17:08,235
- It's really not me. - It must be him.

2244
01:17:08,236 --> 01:17:10,143
- It's not me. - Why are you running away?

2245
01:17:10,337 --> 01:17:11,706
It's because it's not me.

2246
01:17:11,707 --> 01:17:13,035
It's definitely not me.

2247
01:17:13,036 --> 01:17:14,984
I swear to you. I'm not it.

2248
01:17:15,246 --> 01:17:16,506
(Tearing)

2249
01:17:16,507 --> 01:17:18,275
(Haha)

2250
01:17:18,276 --> 01:17:20,745
(She tore of Haha's name tag.)

2251
01:17:20,746 --> 01:17:22,846
I said that I'm not it.

2252
01:17:22,847 --> 01:17:24,009
Haha.

2253
01:17:24,246 --> 01:17:26,615
- I'm not a Hunter. - You'll regret it.

2254
01:17:26,616 --> 01:17:27,850
(It's unclear who the Hunter is.)

2255
01:17:28,257 --> 01:17:29,256
(She goes towards the Hunter's door.)

2256
01:17:29,257 --> 01:17:31,164
Trust my feelings.

2257
01:17:31,356 --> 01:17:32,754
- Are you really not it? - You aren't?

2258
01:17:33,496 --> 01:17:34,895
- I'm not it. - Hurry!

2259
01:17:34,896 --> 01:17:37,172
(At that moment)

2260
01:17:38,137 --> 01:17:40,735
(He takes his chance.)

2261
01:17:40,736 --> 01:17:42,006
- I'm not it. - Hurry!

2262
01:17:42,007 --> 01:17:43,065
Hurry.

2263
01:17:43,066 --> 01:17:45,376
(They spot Jung Seok who comes running.)

2264
01:17:45,377 --> 01:17:49,145
(They run after Jung Seok.)

2265
01:17:49,146 --> 01:17:52,339
(Jung Seok already arrives at the door.)

2266
01:17:54,587 --> 01:17:58,870
(Hunter Jung Seok escapes.)

2267
01:17:59,257 --> 01:18:00,888
Put it on.

2268
01:18:01,656 --> 01:18:03,126
I'm not it.

2269
01:18:03,127 --> 01:18:05,296
(The game is already over.)

2270
01:18:05,297 --> 01:18:07,195
A Hunter went out of Hunter's door.

2271
01:18:07,196 --> 01:18:09,409
The Hunters have cleared their mission.

2272
01:18:10,727 --> 01:18:13,535
(Team Hunters clears the mission, and the race is over.)

2273
01:18:13,536 --> 01:18:15,365
How many times do I have to tell you that I'm not it?

2274
01:18:15,366 --> 01:18:16,631
"How many times"?

2275
01:18:16,736 --> 01:18:18,035
How can I believe you?

2276
01:18:18,036 --> 01:18:19,770
You always say that you're not it.

2277
01:18:19,877 --> 01:18:21,075
Goodness.

2278
01:18:21,076 --> 01:18:22,605
- Are you a Hunter? - I'm not it.

2279
01:18:22,606 --> 01:18:24,046
- Then who is it? - I'm not it.

2280
01:18:24,047 --> 01:18:25,416
- Is it Ji Hyo? - Goodness.

2281
01:18:25,417 --> 01:18:28,446
(Then who's the other Hunter?)

2282
01:18:29,017 --> 01:18:31,285
- Good job, everyone. - Please come out.

2283
01:18:31,286 --> 01:18:33,155
Let's find out...

2284
01:18:33,156 --> 01:18:34,626
if Haha is a Hunter or not.

2285
01:18:34,627 --> 01:18:36,056
- I'll be surprised if he is. - Try it.

2286
01:18:36,057 --> 01:18:37,185
I'm really not it.

2287
01:18:37,186 --> 01:18:38,296
I won't ever believe you again.

2288
01:18:38,297 --> 01:18:39,626
I'm really not it.

2289
01:18:39,627 --> 01:18:41,126
- Are you a Hunter? - I'm not.

2290
01:18:41,127 --> 01:18:42,657
(Neither of them say that they're a Hunter.)

2291
01:18:42,927 --> 01:18:43,966
One.

2292
01:18:43,967 --> 01:18:45,296
(If the light turns green, Haha is a Hunter.)

2293
01:18:45,297 --> 01:18:46,495
- Two. - It's definitely not me.

2294
01:18:46,496 --> 01:18:47,965
(If the light turns green, Haha is a Hunter.)

2295
01:18:48,337 --> 01:18:49,405
Three.

2296
01:18:49,406 --> 01:18:50,967
(If the light turns red, Yoon A is a Hunter.)

2297
01:18:51,036 --> 01:18:53,556
(Which one of them is a real Hunter?)

2298
01:18:55,177 --> 01:18:56,245
Goodness.

2299
01:18:56,246 --> 01:18:57,776
(The light is green.)

2300
01:18:58,276 --> 01:19:02,092
(The other Hunter is Haha.)

2301
01:19:02,887 --> 01:19:05,416
(She feels betrayed again today.)

2302
01:19:05,417 --> 01:19:06,785
(We were fooled.)

2303
01:19:06,786 --> 01:19:08,010
Good job.

2304
01:19:08,986 --> 01:19:10,822
- Hurray to Hunters. - Hurray to Hunters.

2305
01:19:10,986 --> 01:19:12,526
Hurray.

2306
01:19:14,196 --> 01:19:15,553
- Hello. - Goodness.

2307
01:19:16,196 --> 01:19:17,195
Gosh.

2308
01:19:17,196 --> 01:19:18,895
(Haha and Jung Seok are assigned as Hunters.)

2309
01:19:18,896 --> 01:19:20,395
Number 24 is...

2310
01:19:20,597 --> 01:19:22,806
on the back of Jae Seok.

2311
01:19:22,807 --> 01:19:25,306
I'll be eating it openly by the front gate.

2312
01:19:25,307 --> 01:19:26,376
(Haha drew attention.)

2313
01:19:26,377 --> 01:19:27,376
I'm not it.

2314
01:19:27,377 --> 01:19:28,575
(He spots Jung Seok.)

2315
01:19:28,576 --> 01:19:31,546
(He leads other members so that Jung Seok can escape.)

2316
01:19:31,547 --> 01:19:34,476
(With Haha's help, Jung Seok could escape safely.)

2317
01:19:34,477 --> 01:19:37,386
(Hurray for Hunters.)

2318
01:19:37,387 --> 01:19:38,716
In summary,

2319
01:19:38,717 --> 01:19:40,615
the first mission was stealing people's belongings.

2320
01:19:40,616 --> 01:19:41,984
Who stole it?

2321
01:19:42,627 --> 01:19:44,855
- What did you take? - Se Chan helped me.

2322
01:19:44,856 --> 01:19:46,254
Se Chan helped me.

2323
01:19:46,326 --> 01:19:47,550
Me? How?

2324
01:19:47,927 --> 01:19:49,325
- Me? How? - Where's your name tag...

2325
01:19:49,326 --> 01:19:51,029
on your bag, Kwang Soo?

2326
01:19:51,396 --> 01:19:52,695
(Where is...)

2327
01:19:52,696 --> 01:19:53,735
(my name tag?)

2328
01:19:53,736 --> 01:19:56,358
- Your name tag is missing. - His name tag was missing.

2329
01:19:56,707 --> 01:19:59,136
(Who took his name tag?)

2330
01:19:59,137 --> 01:20:00,228
Haha, did you take it...

2331
01:20:00,337 --> 01:20:02,418
from the sole of my foot?

2332
01:20:04,146 --> 01:20:05,346
We'll pick a number.

2333
01:20:05,347 --> 01:20:07,897
(The Hunter's number is picked.)

2334
01:20:08,717 --> 01:20:10,785
(The Hunter's number is 37.)

2335
01:20:10,786 --> 01:20:12,485
Everyone is flustered.

2336
01:20:12,486 --> 01:20:15,893
(Haha had number 37.)

2337
01:20:17,026 --> 01:20:18,025
(Steal a member's belonging.)

2338
01:20:18,026 --> 01:20:21,158
(He was waiting for his chance to clear the mission.)

2339
01:20:21,667 --> 01:20:23,636
- I know that it's not you. - I should stand there.

2340
01:20:24,267 --> 01:20:27,664
(What?)

2341
01:20:28,467 --> 01:20:29,636
I know that it's not you.

2342
01:20:29,637 --> 01:20:33,248
(Kwang Soo's name tag gets stuck on Se Chan's shirt.)

2343
01:20:34,406 --> 01:20:39,679
(The name tag falls on the floor, and he keeps playing the game.)

2344
01:20:41,887 --> 01:20:43,546
- We're next. Okay. - Let's go.

2345
01:20:43,547 --> 01:20:48,321
(Kwang Soo's name tag is on the sole of Se Chan's shoe.)

2346
01:20:49,457 --> 01:20:51,655
(The game is quite physical,)

2347
01:20:51,656 --> 01:20:54,482
(but the name tag stays on his foot.)

2348
01:21:01,707 --> 01:21:05,613
(Haha sees the name tag.)

2349
01:21:06,276 --> 01:21:10,051
(Haha obtains the name tag naturally.)

2350
01:21:10,807 --> 01:21:12,888
(I can't believe this.)

2351
01:21:14,276 --> 01:21:16,346
Look, here it is.

2352
01:21:16,347 --> 01:21:20,485
(He hands Kwang Soo's name tag and clears his first mission.)

2353
01:21:20,486 --> 01:21:22,185
I did it while smiling.

2354
01:21:22,186 --> 01:21:23,656
That's amazing.

2355
01:21:23,786 --> 01:21:24,825
I got goosebumps again.

2356
01:21:24,826 --> 01:21:25,956
If you look carefully,

2357
01:21:25,957 --> 01:21:27,863
- there are people who help them. - Right.

2358
01:21:28,496 --> 01:21:29,895
(They're 3 assistants.)

2359
01:21:29,896 --> 01:21:31,636
- Kwang Soo, Se Chan, and So Min. - No.

2360
01:21:31,637 --> 01:21:32,735
Me?

2361
01:21:32,736 --> 01:21:34,166
Why you...

2362
01:21:34,167 --> 01:21:35,563
Goodness.

2363
01:21:35,736 --> 01:21:38,286
Also the cost of Good Place was...

2364
01:21:38,436 --> 01:21:40,212
646 dollars.

2365
01:21:41,377 --> 01:21:43,346
(646 dollars)

2366
01:21:43,347 --> 01:21:44,346
Really?

2367
01:21:44,347 --> 01:21:46,998
So Min and Yoon A who failed to escape...

2368
01:21:47,116 --> 01:21:48,645
and eliminated Ji Hyo and Jong Kook will...

2369
01:21:48,646 --> 01:21:49,745
share the cost.

2370
01:21:49,746 --> 01:21:51,886
Yoon A is here as a guest.

2371
01:21:51,887 --> 01:21:53,315
- She should pay what she owes. - Right.

2372
01:21:53,316 --> 01:21:54,655
Just pay 15.

2373
01:21:54,656 --> 01:21:56,485
I hope that we will see...

2374
01:21:56,486 --> 01:21:58,056
- Yoon A again. - Right.

2375
01:21:58,057 --> 01:21:59,355
- I don't know when it'll be. - Their movie seems fun.

2376
01:21:59,356 --> 01:22:01,296
They worked on a movie together called "Exit".

2377
01:22:01,297 --> 01:22:03,096
- Be sure to watch it. - Thank you.

2378
01:22:03,097 --> 01:22:04,595
"Exit"!
