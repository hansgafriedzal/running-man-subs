1
00:00:05,800 --> 00:00:08,270
(So Min's raw voice resonates at the vintage cafe.)

2
00:00:08,271 --> 00:00:10,261
- Hello. - Hi.

3
00:00:10,440 --> 00:00:12,158
- Hello. - My goodness.

4
00:00:12,340 --> 00:00:13,509
- Did you release a new song? - Hello.

5
00:00:13,510 --> 00:00:14,753
- Hello. - I...

6
00:00:14,840 --> 00:00:16,880
- I had to film a show that day. - Okay.

7
00:00:16,881 --> 00:00:19,650
But So Min and Ko Young Bae decided to have a meeting...

8
00:00:19,651 --> 00:00:21,349
and already finished the lyrics.

9
00:00:21,350 --> 00:00:22,919
She went to see him in private.

10
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:24,319
- Exactly. - Right.

11
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:25,319
I'm all for having meetings,

12
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:28,927
but why did you meet when I wasn't free and write the lyrics?

13
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:30,303
- Why did you do that? - Hey.

14
00:00:30,661 --> 00:00:33,260
But your team doesn't have a group chatroom...

15
00:00:33,261 --> 00:00:34,847
since you don't have that app.

16
00:00:34,860 --> 00:00:36,029
- Go on. - But...

17
00:00:36,030 --> 00:00:39,069
The songwriter, Gummy, and Jong Kook have their own group chatroom.

18
00:00:39,070 --> 00:00:40,787
(But I have the application too.)

19
00:00:41,500 --> 00:00:42,870
- Really? - By the way,

20
00:00:42,871 --> 00:00:43,940
- you guys are awful. - Is that true?

21
00:00:43,941 --> 00:00:45,370
Just hearing about it is upsetting.

22
00:00:45,371 --> 00:00:46,370
- Really? - I didn't know he wasn't in it.

23
00:00:46,371 --> 00:00:47,779
You guys are terrible.

24
00:00:47,780 --> 00:00:50,080
- We were talking, - That was too mean.

25
00:00:50,081 --> 00:00:51,550
but he was so silent. I thought that he didn't even try to help us.

26
00:00:51,551 --> 00:00:52,950
- Really? - But he wasn't in the chatroom.

27
00:00:52,951 --> 00:00:54,749
- Come on, Jong Kook. - Hey.

28
00:00:54,750 --> 00:00:57,120
- That's too sad. - That was so mean.

29
00:00:57,121 --> 00:00:59,090
He wasn't in it. I wondered why he wasn't.

30
00:00:59,091 --> 00:01:02,760
Kwang Soo, we don't have a group chatroom, right?

31
00:01:02,761 --> 00:01:04,230
We don't have their numbers.

32
00:01:04,231 --> 00:01:05,371
(We don't have Apink members' phone number.)

33
00:01:05,460 --> 00:01:08,360
I saw them when we filmed together. I don't know what they're up to now.

34
00:01:08,361 --> 00:01:10,429
- That's the worst. - Right. We don't have a chatroom.

35
00:01:10,430 --> 00:01:11,770
We don't have their numbers.

36
00:01:11,771 --> 00:01:13,770
What about your team, Seok Jin?

37
00:01:13,771 --> 00:01:16,369
Apink sent us a song first.

38
00:01:16,370 --> 00:01:18,170
Let me tell you about the first song.

39
00:01:18,171 --> 00:01:20,069
Kwang Soo's part lasted 3 seconds, and mine lasted 6 seconds.

40
00:01:20,070 --> 00:01:22,332
So our parts lasted nine seconds in total.

41
00:01:22,441 --> 00:01:24,349
- I said we couldn't do that. - I thought you were bad singers.

42
00:01:24,350 --> 00:01:25,580
They treated you like bad singers.

43
00:01:25,581 --> 00:01:28,050
When I got the guide track, a woman was singing the song.

44
00:01:28,051 --> 00:01:31,420
And a guy sang next. "Blah blah." That was it.

45
00:01:31,421 --> 00:01:32,550
- "What?" - Oh, no.

46
00:01:32,551 --> 00:01:34,690
- And we'll dance... - Nine seconds are too short.

47
00:01:34,691 --> 00:01:36,459
for 3 minutes and 20 seconds next to them.

48
00:01:36,460 --> 00:01:37,459
(We'll dance for the rest of the song.)

49
00:01:37,460 --> 00:01:39,759
- Are you a dancer or what? - We'll keep dancing.

50
00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:40,943
I'm so sick of dancing!

51
00:01:41,131 --> 00:01:42,929
- I said we couldn't do that. - Dancing...

52
00:01:42,930 --> 00:01:44,869
Hey, things are better with me.

53
00:01:44,870 --> 00:01:46,670
- They gave me a longer part. - That's great.

54
00:01:46,671 --> 00:01:49,428
By the way, Haha's third child was born recently.

55
00:01:49,570 --> 00:01:51,839
- Congratulations. - Congratulations.

56
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:53,610
- Congratulations. - Congratulations.

57
00:01:53,611 --> 00:01:54,910
You have a big responsibility.

58
00:01:54,911 --> 00:01:56,140
You'll be crazy about your daughter.

59
00:01:56,141 --> 00:01:58,349
- He's the perfect dad. - He desperately wanted a daughter.

60
00:01:58,350 --> 00:01:59,849
- Yes, I did. - Right.

61
00:01:59,850 --> 00:02:01,520
You're having babies for the sake of Jong Kook too.

62
00:02:01,521 --> 00:02:02,550
- Right. - My gosh.

63
00:02:02,551 --> 00:02:03,849
Thank you.

64
00:02:03,850 --> 00:02:05,649
That's why Jong Kook uploaded a post on his social media account.

65
00:02:05,650 --> 00:02:07,759
- What did he say? - That's right.

66
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:10,219
He wrote that she should show her boyfriend to him first.

67
00:02:10,220 --> 00:02:12,059
- Right. He did write that. - Once she gets a boyfriend,

68
00:02:12,060 --> 00:02:14,029
I wrote that she should show him to me first.

69
00:02:14,030 --> 00:02:16,929
- I wonder how old he'll be by then. - Right.

70
00:02:16,930 --> 00:02:17,969
He can still probably beat the guy.

71
00:02:17,970 --> 00:02:19,070
Anyway,

72
00:02:19,071 --> 00:02:21,170
I don't know which jerk will be my daughter's boyfriend.

73
00:02:21,171 --> 00:02:22,939
- Why? - He's already hostile.

74
00:02:22,940 --> 00:02:23,939
- He's done for. - He's already hostile.

75
00:02:23,940 --> 00:02:26,339
- She's a baby yet. - We should scare him first.

76
00:02:26,340 --> 00:02:27,709
- And we'll get started. - We can crush him.

77
00:02:27,710 --> 00:02:29,309
Right. He's dead meat.

78
00:02:29,310 --> 00:02:31,679
Now that summer is in full swing,

79
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:34,320
we've prepared a couples race you'll do with guests today.

80
00:02:34,321 --> 00:02:36,450
- Couples race. - That's nice.

81
00:02:36,451 --> 00:02:39,420
For your information, today will be all of the guests'...

82
00:02:39,421 --> 00:02:40,820
first time to be on our show.

83
00:02:40,821 --> 00:02:42,589
- Really? - That doesn't happen often.

84
00:02:42,590 --> 00:02:44,860
- Right. - Compared to their amazing careers,

85
00:02:44,861 --> 00:02:46,659
- they are not as well-known. - I see.

86
00:02:46,660 --> 00:02:48,230
- So... - Their popularity is low.

87
00:02:48,231 --> 00:02:50,659
There's an actor who was in a movie that sold 16 million tickets.

88
00:02:50,660 --> 00:02:52,129
- Really? - But why wouldn't we know?

89
00:02:52,130 --> 00:02:53,230
- We would know that actor. - And there's a guest who filmed...

90
00:02:53,231 --> 00:02:55,570
- over 60 commercials. - Over 60 commercials?

91
00:02:55,571 --> 00:02:57,510
- That person is a celebrity. - That person must be so famous.

92
00:02:57,511 --> 00:02:59,591
If that person filmed 60, is he or she old?

93
00:02:59,870 --> 00:03:00,879
- What? - Will there be an old celebrity?

94
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:02,640
If that person filmed a commercial every year...

95
00:03:02,641 --> 00:03:04,832
There's a genius guest who debuted at the age of 11.

96
00:03:05,111 --> 00:03:06,409
- A genius? - At the age of 11?

97
00:03:06,410 --> 00:03:08,820
And there's a guest who was the most searched person online.

98
00:03:08,821 --> 00:03:10,950
- But... - I'd know. I watch TV a lot.

99
00:03:10,951 --> 00:03:13,649
If they are distinguished, we would know them.

100
00:03:13,650 --> 00:03:15,689
- I'm on a lot of social media. - Right.

101
00:03:15,690 --> 00:03:17,659
- I'll bring them in now. - Shall we?

102
00:03:17,660 --> 00:03:19,260
- Please come on in. - All right.

103
00:03:19,261 --> 00:03:21,929
- Who are they? - They'll come out at once.

104
00:03:21,930 --> 00:03:23,981
- Here they are. - Here they come.

105
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:27,439
Hello.

106
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:29,270
- Hello. - Hello.

107

- Hello. - Hi.

114
00:03:38,951 --> 00:03:40,749
- Hi. - Hello.

115
00:03:40,750 --> 00:03:43,279
- We recognize some of them. - Right.

116
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:44,420
I know Seung Hee.

117
00:03:44,421 --> 00:03:46,219
- We know Seung Hee. - We know Seung Hee.

118
00:03:46,220 --> 00:03:50,559
I am so sorry, but I don't know them.

119
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:53,257
Hey. Just don't say that out loud.

120
00:03:53,590 --> 00:03:55,600
Haha, stop it.

121
00:03:55,601 --> 00:03:57,830
Why don't you introduce yourself first?

122
00:03:57,831 --> 00:04:00,399
Hello, I'm an actress. My name is Song Ji In.

123
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:01,670
All right!

124
00:04:01,671 --> 00:04:02,782
(Looking innocent and bubbly)

125

(An actress who can pull off a wide array of roles)

127
00:04:17,221 --> 00:04:18,949
- I see. - Right.

128

- I'm such a fan. - I remember her now.

129
00:04:20,750 --> 00:04:22,220
- I recognize her now. - I'm such a huge fan.

130

- Others... - You don't know her.

131

- You don't know her. - I'm a huge fan.

132
00:04:24,591 --> 00:04:27,759
All right. Just like I said earlier, Ji In debuted in 2008...

133
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:30,791
through Davichi's music video for "Love and War".

134
00:04:30,901 --> 00:04:33,230
- What? - Hey, it's me.

135
00:04:33,231 --> 00:04:35,199
- "Love and War". - I featured in the song.

136

"You don't recognize me?"

142
00:04:45,810 --> 00:04:47,094
You were in a historical drama very recently, right?

143
00:04:47,250 --> 00:04:49,920
- Yes, I was in "Haechi". - Really?

144
00:04:49,921 --> 00:04:51,220
- "Haechi". - Stop pretending to know her.

145
00:04:51,221 --> 00:04:52,850
- "Haechi"? - I told you that.

146
00:04:52,851 --> 00:04:54,689
I told you that.

147
00:04:54,690 --> 00:04:56,119
- I told you that. - Wait.

148
00:04:56,120 --> 00:04:57,759
Isn't Ji In in your agency?

149
00:04:57,760 --> 00:04:59,507
- Yes, she is. - We're in the same agency.

150
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:02,199
Now, I can put the pieces together.

151
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:04,569
- I can put the pieces together now. - Hey.

152
00:05:04,570 --> 00:05:06,829
All right. We'll go inside now.

- So Min can bring in people? - You are in the same agency?

157

- That's not true. - I get it.

158

- Go, So Min! - My goodness.

159
00:05:17,750 --> 00:05:19,249
- Seriously. - Goodness.

160
00:05:19,250 --> 00:05:21,280
- You've crossed paths before. - What?

161
00:05:21,281 --> 00:05:22,420
What? I filmed a commercial with you?

162
00:05:22,421 --> 00:05:24,650
That's why we shouldn't just criticize Haha.

163
00:05:24,651 --> 00:05:25,749
- My gosh. - Gosh.

164
00:05:25,750 --> 00:05:27,050
- You filmed a commercial with her. - He can't remember her.

165
00:05:27,051 --> 00:05:28,460
- You filmed it with her. - When did I...

166
00:05:28,461 --> 00:05:30,860
- When was that? - It was with Lee Young Ae.

- Lee Young Ae... - I know that commercial.

170
00:05:35,060 --> 00:05:36,829
When we filmed the commercial, "Infinite Challenge" came to film.

171
00:05:36,830 --> 00:05:39,269
- Right. We went to film a show too. - They came too.

172
00:05:39,270 --> 00:05:40,369
You were there too.

173
00:05:40,370 --> 00:05:41,369
(Haha, you were there too.)

174
00:05:41,370 --> 00:05:42,369
Right.

175
00:05:42,370 --> 00:05:43,970
- Hello. - Right.

176
00:05:43,971 --> 00:05:44,970
- It's been a while. - Sure.

177
00:05:44,971 --> 00:05:47,069
- She has a fun story about it. - What was it?

178
00:05:47,070 --> 00:05:49,679
That's when I had just started my career.

179
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:51,579
I didn't have an agent then.

180
00:05:51,580 --> 00:05:53,710
I went to the set to film the commercial alone.

181
00:05:53,711 --> 00:05:54,963
Go on.

182
00:05:55,320 --> 00:05:57,949
You were sitting down there and eating gimbap.

183
00:05:57,950 --> 00:06:00,019
- I think I remember that. - Go on.

184
00:06:00,020 --> 00:06:03,798
When I said that I came in to check the outfit,

185
00:06:03,961 --> 00:06:05,981
you thought that I was from the advertiser.

186
00:06:06,130 --> 00:06:08,600
You got up right away when you were eating gimbap.

187
00:06:08,601 --> 00:06:09,812
"My gosh."

188
00:06:10,060 --> 00:06:11,300
Did Jae Seok behave like that too?

189
00:06:11,301 --> 00:06:12,670
- Jae Seok. - Did he do that too?

190
00:06:12,671 --> 00:06:14,470
- He gets up quickly too. - You were insecure too.

191
00:06:14,471 --> 00:06:16,170
- He did that? - You used to be insecure too.

192
00:06:16,171 --> 00:06:17,670
- You were insecure. - "How is this outfit?"

193
00:06:17,671 --> 00:06:19,410
- "Is this okay?" - "Shall we go with this?"

194
00:06:19,411 --> 00:06:20,569
"My goodness."

195
00:06:20,570 --> 00:06:22,157
- "I'll do my best." - "Do you not like it?"

196
00:06:22,341 --> 00:06:24,850
Jong Kook wasn't like that before. But he's teasing me a lot lately.

197
00:06:24,851 --> 00:06:26,910
- "Is this okay for you?" - Jae Seok.

198
00:06:26,911 --> 00:06:28,566
- "I'll do my best!" - My goodness.

199
00:06:28,851 --> 00:06:31,290
- I did that? - Yes, you were just like that.

200
00:06:31,291 --> 00:06:33,239
- My goodness. - That's funny.

201
00:06:33,351 --> 00:06:36,590
All right. Let me introduce the next guest to you.

202
00:06:36,591 --> 00:06:39,186
First off, give a round of applause to Jang Jin Hee.

203
00:06:39,190 --> 00:06:41,080
(Looking shy)

204
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,730
(She made a glorious debut as a model at the age of 16.)

205
00:06:44,731 --> 00:06:47,499
(Jang Jin Hee, an actress with the perfect body proportion)

206
00:06:47,500 --> 00:06:50,040
(She was beloved for her role as Ha Kyun's favorite killer...)

207
00:06:50,041 --> 00:06:52,696
(in "Extreme Job" which sold 16 million tickets in theaters.)

208
00:06:53,741 --> 00:06:56,741
("How far should I cut?", Jin Hee's famous line)

209
00:06:57,041 --> 00:06:58,650
You were the killer in "Extreme Job".

210
00:06:58,651 --> 00:07:00,249
- Right. Sun Hee. - By the way,

211
00:07:00,250 --> 00:07:03,988
- Jin Hee. - she'll be a match to Jong Kook.

212
00:07:04,851 --> 00:07:05,962
I can see that.

213
00:07:06,020 --> 00:07:07,505
(Scowling)

214
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:08,920
She's tall.

215
00:07:08,921 --> 00:07:10,689
- She's the best fighter. - Seriously.

216
00:07:10,690 --> 00:07:13,129
She can do jujitsu and walk like a model.

217
00:07:13,130 --> 00:07:16,160
She debuted at a young age of 16 as a model.

218
00:07:16,161 --> 00:07:18,595
Can you show us your walk?

219
00:07:18,671 --> 00:07:20,821
- My gosh. - Can you walk down from over there?

220
00:07:21,341 --> 00:07:22,600
She's really tall.

221
00:07:22,601 --> 00:07:24,610
- Play the music. - She's cool.

222
00:07:24,611 --> 00:07:25,670
Total girl crush.

223
00:07:25,671 --> 00:07:27,185
(How will the former model walk?)

224
00:07:28,781 --> 00:07:30,599
(Looking chic)

225
00:07:31,481 --> 00:07:32,749
Her posture is different to begin with.

226
00:07:32,750 --> 00:07:34,420
- How could she do that? - Look at her.

227
00:07:34,421 --> 00:07:36,066
She changed completely.

228
00:07:36,250 --> 00:07:37,650
She's so cool.

229
00:07:37,651 --> 00:07:39,569
(Looking confident)

230
00:07:40,421 --> 00:07:42,759
(She turns the spot she's standing on into a runway.)

231
00:07:42,760 --> 00:07:44,990
- Her eyes changed completely. - She's so good.

232
00:07:44,991 --> 00:07:46,090
She was a model indeed.

233
00:07:46,091 --> 00:07:47,504
She's so cool.

234
00:07:48,031 --> 00:07:49,860
Jin Hee, please dance after your walk.

235
00:07:49,861 --> 00:07:51,042
(Smiling)

236
00:07:51,070 --> 00:07:52,747
- She's different. - She has to turn around.

237
00:07:53,330 --> 00:07:55,740
- Her pose is different. - Yes, indeed. She's done it before.

238
00:07:55,741 --> 00:07:56,740
(I'm Jang Jin Hee.)

239
00:07:56,741 --> 00:07:58,487
(Doing a traditional dance)

240
00:07:59,070 --> 00:08:01,807
(Dancing away)

241
00:08:02,341 --> 00:08:03,379
(She comes back to her shy self.)

242
00:08:03,380 --> 00:08:05,379
- She made it fun. - By the way,

243
00:08:05,380 --> 00:08:07,430
- That was impressive. - her walk was different indeed.

244
00:08:07,580 --> 00:08:09,480
- She looked like a foreign model. - Right.

245
00:08:09,481 --> 00:08:11,915
- She did the facial expression too. - How did you change it so quickly?

246
00:08:12,190 --> 00:08:14,119
- She's impressive. - She's cool.

247
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:15,290
Next.

248
00:08:15,291 --> 00:08:18,360
- She's next to Seung Hee. - My gosh.

249
00:08:18,361 --> 00:08:19,490
I know her.

250
00:08:19,491 --> 00:08:20,590
- You know her? What does she do? - Really?

251
00:08:20,591 --> 00:08:22,829
- She is Shin Seung Hun's... - Yes.

252
00:08:22,830 --> 00:08:24,369
Seung Hun is helping her become a singer.

253
00:08:24,370 --> 00:08:25,400
(She's known as his muse and a hotshot singer.)

254
00:08:25,401 --> 00:08:26,730
This is Rothy.

255
00:08:26,731 --> 00:08:27,982
Hello.

256
00:08:29,471 --> 00:08:34,580
(Rothy is a new singer Shin Seung Hun discovered.)

257
00:08:34,581 --> 00:08:37,210
(Last week, on a TV competition show, )

258
00:08:37,211 --> 00:08:43,109
(her outstanding singing made her go viral online.)

259
00:08:44,351 --> 00:08:46,350
- She must be a great singer... - I guess so.

260
00:08:46,351 --> 00:08:48,389
- Seung Hun... - if he gives her private lessons.

261
00:08:48,390 --> 00:08:50,006
He has high standards.

262
00:08:50,091 --> 00:08:52,730
Could you tell us a few things that your teacher, Seung Hun,

263
00:08:52,731 --> 00:08:54,159
taught you?

264
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:55,960
As for variety shows...

265
00:08:55,961 --> 00:08:57,399
- He taught you about variety shows? - He taught you...

266
00:08:57,400 --> 00:08:58,570
- about variety shows? - But he's not entertaining.

267
00:08:58,571 --> 00:09:01,369
So he didn't tell me a lot since he's not on variety shows.

268
00:09:01,370 --> 00:09:04,340
- When I'm on music shows, - Okay.

269
00:09:04,341 --> 00:09:06,259
he told me about the jawline of a ballad singer.

270
00:09:07,071 --> 00:09:08,539
He told me to make my jawline stand out.

271
00:09:08,540 --> 00:09:10,879
- His jawline isn't sharp anymore. - Come on, that's enough.

272
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:13,536
(His jawline isn't sharp anymore.)

273
00:09:13,681 --> 00:09:15,119
- Don't say that. - I saw him recently.

274
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:16,919
I agree with you on that.

275
00:09:16,920 --> 00:09:18,320
Goodness.

276
00:09:18,321 --> 00:09:19,720
All right. Next.

277
00:09:19,721 --> 00:09:21,090
"We found them, OH MY GIRL."

278
00:09:21,091 --> 00:09:22,460
This is Seung Hee from OH MY GIRL.

279
00:09:22,461 --> 00:09:25,057
(The last guest is Seung Hee from OH MY GIRL.)

280
00:09:25,491 --> 00:09:30,200
(She's the main vocalist in a girl group, full of fairies.)

281
00:09:30,201 --> 00:09:34,330
(Actually, her talent and singing skills...)

282
00:09:34,331 --> 00:09:38,369
(have been confirmed on various TV show at the age of 11.)

283
00:09:38,370 --> 00:09:44,036
(The prodigy singer is joining Running Man today!)

284
00:09:44,650 --> 00:09:45,950
She's the best.

285
00:09:45,951 --> 00:09:47,820
Hello, I'm from OH MY GIRL.

286
00:09:47,821 --> 00:09:50,019
As you all know, she debuted...

287
00:09:50,020 --> 00:09:52,119
- on "National Singing Contest". - Right.

288
00:09:52,120 --> 00:09:53,820
- She was young too. - At the age of 11.

289
00:09:53,821 --> 00:09:55,820
- She was the prodigy singer. - Right. She was.

290
00:09:55,821 --> 00:09:57,220
She used to sing folk songs, so she can turn...

291
00:09:57,221 --> 00:09:59,129
- pop songs into folk songs. - She's good.

292
00:09:59,130 --> 00:10:00,730
Or she can turn children's songs into folk songs.

293
00:10:00,731 --> 00:10:01,960
Can you sing some folk songs?

294
00:10:01,961 --> 00:10:03,799
Which song should I turn into a folk song?

295
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:05,200
I can change any song.

296
00:10:05,201 --> 00:10:08,299
- Try it with "One Man". - You can change it?

297
00:10:08,300 --> 00:10:13,361
("One Man" is a masterpiece ballad song. How will it sound?)

298
00:10:13,770 --> 00:10:16,539
(There's a man)

299
00:10:16,540 --> 00:10:17,793
Oh, goodness.

300
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:22,680
(He loves you dearly)

301
00:10:22,681 --> 00:10:23,820
- That sounded to sorrowful. - "Loves you dearly".

302
00:10:23,821 --> 00:10:25,149
Did you hear her lilting voice?

303
00:10:25,150 --> 00:10:28,291
- That sounded so colorful. - She'd be great with trot songs.

304
00:10:28,461 --> 00:10:31,830
She loves animals to the point that her hobby is watching animal videos.

305
00:10:31,831 --> 00:10:34,284
Are there any animals that resemble us?

306
00:10:34,530 --> 00:10:37,060
Kwang Soo stands out the most since he's the tallest.

307
00:10:37,061 --> 00:10:39,100
- There's a monkey named sifaka. - What?

308
00:10:39,101 --> 00:10:40,570
(That's Kwang Soo's lookalike.)

309
00:10:40,571 --> 00:10:41,700
- What? - She scared me for a second.

310
00:10:41,701 --> 00:10:43,039
- I was so shocked just now. - That was the name.

311
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:44,687
- What? - It was a weird name.

312
00:10:44,941 --> 00:10:47,169
- What did she say? - It suits him so well.

313
00:10:47,170 --> 00:10:49,210
- Does that really exist? - How does that monkey look?

314
00:10:49,211 --> 00:10:50,279
- A sifaka monkey. - It's a white monkey.

315
00:10:50,280 --> 00:10:51,866
I know which one she's talking about.

316
00:10:52,550 --> 00:10:54,096
(Unable to talk)

317
00:10:54,520 --> 00:10:56,580
- What about me? - Nutria.

318
00:10:56,581 --> 00:10:58,649
You? You resemble your mother.

319
00:10:58,650 --> 00:11:01,320
(You? You resemble your mother.)

320
00:11:01,321 --> 00:11:03,411
- You're the spitting image of her. - When you asked that question...

321
00:11:03,561 --> 00:11:05,289
When you asked that question,

322
00:11:05,290 --> 00:11:07,249
you were trying to look handsome. That was so annoying.

323
00:11:07,390 --> 00:11:09,753
- That was so annoying. - Seriously. He's...

324
00:11:09,900 --> 00:11:11,700
- He's unbelievable. - He tried to look handsome.

325
00:11:11,701 --> 00:11:12,899
You wanted to look handsome.

326
00:11:12,900 --> 00:11:15,340
- He looks just like nutria. - I totally agree.

327
00:11:15,341 --> 00:11:16,799
However, I always say this.

328
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:19,269
I really believe that there must be...

329
00:11:19,270 --> 00:11:20,909
- a lot of opportunities... - Yes, there must be.

330
00:11:20,910 --> 00:11:22,440
- for these talented individuals. - Right.

331
00:11:22,441 --> 00:11:24,779
They don't have a lot of chances to show their talent these days.

332
00:11:24,780 --> 00:11:28,215
Today, a prize and a penalty are at stake on this couples race.

333
00:11:28,420 --> 00:11:32,119
Before we start the race, you will pair up first.

334
00:11:32,120 --> 00:11:34,444
To decide your partners, you'll cast the Talent Dice.

335
00:11:35,321 --> 00:11:38,490
The female members will receive a dice with photos...

336
00:11:38,491 --> 00:11:40,159
of the male members on each side.

337
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:42,600
Everyone will challenge to win the talent the female members...

338
00:11:42,601 --> 00:11:44,115
submitted beforehand.

339
00:11:44,231 --> 00:11:45,930
If the female member wins her own talent match,

340
00:11:45,931 --> 00:11:47,788
she can choose a male member that she wants.

341
00:11:47,900 --> 00:11:50,039
But if she loses, the winner can switch two of the photos...

342
00:11:50,040 --> 00:11:51,710
on the dice.

343
00:11:51,711 --> 00:11:53,310
We can switch the photo stickers.

344
00:11:53,311 --> 00:11:55,740
- Ladies, please take your dice. - Okay.

345
00:11:55,741 --> 00:11:57,124
Go ahead and take it.

346
00:11:57,481 --> 00:11:59,850
My gosh, there are no male guests.

347
00:11:59,851 --> 00:12:02,709
(She talks to herself very loudly.)

348
00:12:02,981 --> 00:12:04,768
We're here. You have us.

349
00:12:04,851 --> 00:12:06,419
Since there are no male guests today,

350
00:12:06,420 --> 00:12:08,119
Ji Hyo and So Min seem...

351
00:12:08,120 --> 00:12:09,720
- I don't feel motivated. - look exhausted all of a sudden.

352
00:12:09,721 --> 00:12:11,105
Come on, cheer us up.

353
00:12:11,831 --> 00:12:15,100
But I do feel sorry.

354
00:12:15,101 --> 00:12:16,413
What do you mean?

355
00:12:16,561 --> 00:12:18,086
Their side dishes aren't that attractive.

356
00:12:18,500 --> 00:12:20,389
Side dishes? Don't call us that.

357
00:12:20,770 --> 00:12:23,100
All right. To play this game,

358
00:12:23,101 --> 00:12:24,940
- you wrote down your talent. - Yes.

359
00:12:24,941 --> 00:12:28,580
We're going to reveal one at a time.

360
00:12:28,581 --> 00:12:29,980
- Yes. - Who wants to draw first?

361
00:12:29,981 --> 00:12:32,030
- So Min, do you want to go first? - Me?

362
00:12:32,211 --> 00:12:34,450
- So Min's talent must be in there. - Exactly.

363
00:12:34,451 --> 00:12:35,820
(If she wins the talent match, she can switch the photos herself.)

364
00:12:35,821 --> 00:12:37,537
I'm curious about her talent.

365
00:12:38,321 --> 00:12:39,749
I read what she wrote down.

366
00:12:39,750 --> 00:12:40,820
- It was hilarious. - So Min...

367
00:12:40,821 --> 00:12:42,779
- So Min has a lot of talents. - What?

368
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:45,590
- What is it? - I picked this one.

369
00:12:45,591 --> 00:12:46,730
What is it? What are you good at?

370
00:12:46,731 --> 00:12:47,789
I chose my own.

371
00:12:47,790 --> 00:12:48,930
"Happy Virus"?

372
00:12:48,931 --> 00:12:51,200
(So Min's Talent: Happy Virus)

373
00:12:51,201 --> 00:12:52,600
- What do you mean by that? - Well, I can make you laugh...

374
00:12:52,601 --> 00:12:53,899
in five seconds.

375
00:12:53,900 --> 00:12:55,639
(That's my talent.)

376
00:12:55,640 --> 00:12:57,600
- How? - You can make us laugh?

377
00:12:57,601 --> 00:12:59,110
- I won't laugh. I don't laugh. - Isn't this too hard?

378
00:12:59,111 --> 00:13:00,169
This is hard.

379
00:13:00,170 --> 00:13:02,240
It's hard to make us laugh after saying that you will.

380
00:13:02,241 --> 00:13:04,080
If you're going to give this a try,

381
00:13:04,081 --> 00:13:05,810
you can challenge So Min at this talent match.

382
00:13:05,811 --> 00:13:08,648
But So Min has to choose one person...

383
00:13:08,780 --> 00:13:10,437
and make that person laugh in five seconds.

384
00:13:10,481 --> 00:13:11,749
Jae Seok.

385
00:13:11,750 --> 00:13:13,019
(I choose Jae Seok.)

386
00:13:13,020 --> 00:13:14,820
I think he's going to laugh more easily.

387
00:13:14,821 --> 00:13:16,990
- Right. He does laugh easily. - He can't hold it back.

388
00:13:16,991 --> 00:13:19,354
- I can hold out if I wanted. - He's already laughing.

389
00:13:19,461 --> 00:13:20,730
You can do it if you put your mind to it.

390
00:13:20,731 --> 00:13:21,799
- Give it a try. - He's already laughing.

391
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:24,230
- It's funny that she'd try this. - Is that so?

392
00:13:24,231 --> 00:13:26,570
(Why would an actress try to make us laugh?)

393
00:13:26,571 --> 00:13:28,600
- I mean... Hold on. - How can she be so gutsy?

394
00:13:28,601 --> 00:13:29,769
Why would she?

395
00:13:29,770 --> 00:13:31,299
Even comedians don't do this a lot.

396
00:13:31,300 --> 00:13:33,669
(Even comedians don't do this a lot.)

397
00:13:33,670 --> 00:13:37,110
Even the professionals don't do stuff like this. They don't.

398
00:13:37,111 --> 00:13:38,879
Why would professionals set this up?

399
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:40,310
(No professionals would declare to be funny.)

400
00:13:40,311 --> 00:13:43,119
It's ridiculous how she called herself Happy Virus.

401
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:44,519
Are you sure you can pull it off?

402
00:13:44,520 --> 00:13:46,066
Yes, I am sure.

403
00:13:46,150 --> 00:13:48,220
Don't be disappointed when I don't laugh.

404
00:13:48,221 --> 00:13:49,659
- I'm serious. - I can do this.

405
00:13:49,660 --> 00:13:52,090
Jae Seok, come closer. No, come closer.

406
00:13:52,091 --> 00:13:54,090
- I'll lower the card and start. - Okay.

407
00:13:54,091 --> 00:13:55,848
- Look at my face closely. - Okay.

408
00:13:55,900 --> 00:13:57,200
In 1, 2, 3.

409
00:13:57,201 --> 00:13:58,700
(Flaring her nostrils)

410
00:13:58,701 --> 00:14:00,399
(Well, this is...)

411
00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:02,669
- Come on. - What was that?

412
00:14:02,670 --> 00:14:04,869
(He was looking at So Min's face up close.)

413
00:14:04,870 --> 00:14:07,496
(Her nostrils knock him down.)

414
00:14:07,770 --> 00:14:08,840
- What was that? - What?

415
00:14:08,841 --> 00:14:10,639
- How did that work? - Why did you laugh at that?

416
00:14:10,640 --> 00:14:12,450
- She just flared her nostrils. - Hey.

417
00:14:12,451 --> 00:14:14,680
She was right in front of me. She did this right in front of me.

418
00:14:14,681 --> 00:14:15,964
(Did you see that?)

419
00:14:16,221 --> 00:14:18,019
- Look at that. She's... - Is that funny?

420
00:14:18,020 --> 00:14:19,519
It's your fault for laughing at that.

421
00:14:19,520 --> 00:14:21,519
- Seok Jin, you should try it. - Try it on me.

422
00:14:21,520 --> 00:14:22,990
- Do it on me. - Go ahead.

423
00:14:22,991 --> 00:14:24,090
- Look. - Okay.

424
00:14:24,091 --> 00:14:25,129
She was...

425
00:14:25,130 --> 00:14:27,730
- Goodness. What's wrong with her? - Okay.

426
00:14:27,731 --> 00:14:29,799
- In 1, 2, 3. - She's so weird.

427
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:35,658
(Can So Min make Seok Jin laugh?)

428
00:14:37,770 --> 00:14:39,427
What if he falls in love with her?

429
00:14:41,410 --> 00:14:43,835
(What if he falls in love with her?)

430
00:14:43,981 --> 00:14:46,505
- Seok Jin, why did you turn red? - Hey!

431
00:14:47,351 --> 00:14:48,850
Why did your face turn red?

432
00:14:48,851 --> 00:14:51,019
- Why did you get red? - "Pounding, pounding".

433
00:14:51,020 --> 00:14:54,049
- Seok Jin lifted his heels. - Stop that.

434
00:14:54,050 --> 00:14:55,560
- What's wrong with you? - Nothing is wrong with me.

435
00:14:55,561 --> 00:14:57,590
Why do you... Why do you keep turning red?

436
00:14:57,591 --> 00:14:59,490
- I didn't laugh. What is it? - Seok Jin.

437
00:14:59,491 --> 00:15:01,230
- You guys are the weird ones. - Seriously.

438
00:15:01,231 --> 00:15:02,730
All of a sudden, you close your eyes.

439
00:15:02,731 --> 00:15:03,999
(He keeps cornering Seok Jin.)

440
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,730
(The new love interest is important, not verifying the talent.)

441
00:15:06,731 --> 00:15:08,084
Happy Virus.

442
00:15:08,170 --> 00:15:10,399
- All right. - It should've been Laughter Virus.

443
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:12,039
So Min succeeded for now.

444
00:15:12,040 --> 00:15:13,656
- I did it. - So Min succeeded.

445
00:15:13,811 --> 00:15:15,195
- I'll try it. - You'll try it?

446
00:15:16,280 --> 00:15:17,810
(Which member will Rothy pick?)

447
00:15:17,811 --> 00:15:19,480
I can choose? I'll choose you.

448
00:15:19,481 --> 00:15:20,925
- Me? - Yes.

449
00:15:21,181 --> 00:15:22,779
(You'll try to make me laugh?)

450
00:15:22,780 --> 00:15:25,346
Comedians don't laugh if they set their mind to it.

451
00:15:26,591 --> 00:15:28,539
- Can you step back and do it? - I can just do anything.

452
00:15:29,020 --> 00:15:30,159
(Se Chan tries to keep a safe distance.)

453
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:31,360
- I can just do anything. - Wait.

454
00:15:31,361 --> 00:15:32,430
- Come here. - I know for sure.

455
00:15:32,431 --> 00:15:33,860
He'll laugh if she says she loves him.

456
00:15:33,861 --> 00:15:35,999
He'll laugh if she says that. Look. He's already laughing.

457
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,999
- He laughed when I said it. - Stop it.

458
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,919
- He laughed when I said it. - Please stop it.

459
00:15:40,071 --> 00:15:42,192
- I'm going to hide my gums. - Tell him you love him.

460
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:45,535
Rothy. First, face the back and turn around like this.

461
00:15:45,670 --> 00:15:46,669
Like this?

462
00:15:46,670 --> 00:15:48,802
- Use your hair. - Hit him with your hair.

463
00:15:48,841 --> 00:15:49,940
Show me.

464
00:15:49,941 --> 00:15:53,649
(Show me your gums.)

465
00:15:53,650 --> 00:15:59,049
(Will she be able to make Se Chan, the man who never laughs, laugh?)

466
00:15:59,050 --> 00:16:00,504
(Laughing)

467
00:16:00,890 --> 00:16:02,860
(At Rothy's tactic with her hair, )

468
00:16:02,861 --> 00:16:05,029
(he shows her his gums.)

469
00:16:05,030 --> 00:16:06,747
(That's it. Well done.)

470
00:16:06,890 --> 00:16:08,360
- Hey. - I can't help it.

471
00:16:08,361 --> 00:16:10,060
- I'm so disappointed. - I can't help it.

472
00:16:10,061 --> 00:16:11,529
- I'm happy. What can I do? - Hey.

473
00:16:11,530 --> 00:16:13,999
You should have flared your nostrils like So Min.

474
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,688
(She tries her cute moves on Se Chan.)

475
00:16:16,601 --> 00:16:17,899
She didn't do anything.

476
00:16:17,900 --> 00:16:20,470
I laughed at her because it was ridiculous.

477
00:16:20,471 --> 00:16:22,680
(Rothy beats So Min and wins with the help of Haha.)

478
00:16:22,681 --> 00:16:24,701
Does anyone want to give it a go?

479
00:16:24,981 --> 00:16:26,279
Perhaps, I shouldn't have. Kwang Soo.

480
00:16:26,280 --> 00:16:28,220
(Jin Hee will try to make Kwang Soo laugh.)

481
00:16:28,221 --> 00:16:29,493
Okay.

482
00:16:29,550 --> 00:16:30,879
Kwang Soo is good at holding back.

483
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:32,720
- I'm good at that. - He's good at that.

484
00:16:32,721 --> 00:16:34,049
(Can she make Kwang Soo laugh?)

485
00:16:34,050 --> 00:16:35,820
- I'll be really objective. - Why are you so far away?

486
00:16:35,821 --> 00:16:37,320
- But you know, he's... - Yes?

487
00:16:37,321 --> 00:16:38,573
I'll give you a tip.

488
00:16:39,160 --> 00:16:40,949
- He laughs when he's in pain. - What?

489
00:16:41,431 --> 00:16:43,047
(Whispering)

490
00:16:43,461 --> 00:16:45,129
- He laughs when he's hurt. - In that case,

491
00:16:45,130 --> 00:16:47,029
can I make him cry in five seconds?

492
00:16:47,030 --> 00:16:50,030
(She sounds so innocent.)

493
00:16:51,400 --> 00:16:53,210
- You'll make him cry? - Kwang Soo.

494
00:16:53,211 --> 00:16:54,624
Kwang Soo looks nervous.

495
00:16:54,741 --> 00:16:56,296
- Are you going to hit him? - You'll make him cry?

496
00:16:56,410 --> 00:16:58,805
- She'll make me shed tears? - She'll hurt you.

497
00:16:59,211 --> 00:17:01,779
Jin Hee, can you tell me what you're planning to do?

498
00:17:01,780 --> 00:17:02,980
I'll do a low kick.

499
00:17:02,981 --> 00:17:04,294
Where are you pointing at?

500
00:17:04,921 --> 00:17:06,220
(Kwang Soo is sensitive.)

501
00:17:06,221 --> 00:17:07,534
(Flinching)

502
00:17:07,991 --> 00:17:09,909
- Where will your low kick land on? - Jin Hee.

503
00:17:10,360 --> 00:17:12,089
- Within five seconds... - Shouldn't she make him laugh?

504
00:17:12,090 --> 00:17:14,586
Aren't you supposed to make him laugh within five seconds?

505
00:17:14,901 --> 00:17:17,890
- He said he laughs when he's hurt. - I see.

506
00:17:18,500 --> 00:17:21,230
Well, I've gotten a lot of kicks before.

507
00:17:21,231 --> 00:17:23,039
(She's ready to launch her low kick.)

508
00:17:23,040 --> 00:17:24,314
I'll try it now.

509
00:17:25,810 --> 00:17:27,528
Kwang Soo is good at enduring the pain.

510
00:17:28,310 --> 00:17:29,539
I've gotten a lot of kicks before.

511
00:17:29,540 --> 00:17:33,994
(Can Jin Hee make Kwang Soo laugh with her low kick?)

512
00:17:34,211 --> 00:17:35,319
Here I go.

513
00:17:35,320 --> 00:17:36,493
(Kicking hard)

514
00:17:38,891 --> 00:17:41,315
(Screaming and laughing)

515
00:17:42,290 --> 00:17:44,513
He laughed. Kwang Soo laughed.

516
00:17:44,760 --> 00:17:46,144
That must've hurt.

517
00:17:47,290 --> 00:17:49,018
Jin Hee wins.

518
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:51,448
I could feel his pain.

519
00:17:51,500 --> 00:17:52,884
Are you sure he laughed?

520
00:17:53,231 --> 00:17:55,493
It surely must be a virus. He's still smiling.

521
00:17:56,270 --> 00:17:58,200
Doesn't the person who smiles the longest win?

522
00:17:58,201 --> 00:17:59,352
You're right.

523
00:17:59,510 --> 00:18:00,710
It's fun.

524
00:18:00,711 --> 00:18:01,940
He keeps smiling.

525
00:18:01,941 --> 00:18:04,539
Jin Hee won.

526
00:18:04,540 --> 00:18:05,779
She won.

527
00:18:05,780 --> 00:18:08,620
You can remove two stickers from So Min's die...

528
00:18:08,621 --> 00:18:10,620
and switch them with others' faces.

529
00:18:10,621 --> 00:18:12,019
She'll remove the people she wants to partner up with, right?

530
00:18:12,020 --> 00:18:13,849
That's right.

531
00:18:13,850 --> 00:18:15,589
- This... - She's looking at you.

532
00:18:15,590 --> 00:18:17,420
(She removes Kwang Soo's face.)

533
00:18:17,421 --> 00:18:19,147
- I need to remove 2, right? - Yes, 1 more.

534
00:18:20,830 --> 00:18:22,559
(She removes Jong Kook's face.)

535
00:18:22,560 --> 00:18:23,559
She took the good ones.

536
00:18:23,560 --> 00:18:25,318
Whose faces would you like?

537
00:18:25,671 --> 00:18:27,822
- Mister Seok Jin and... - Why?

538
00:18:28,401 --> 00:18:30,370
(She picks Seok Jin.)

539
00:18:30,371 --> 00:18:31,612
She called you mister.

540
00:18:31,971 --> 00:18:33,140
- And? - Seok Jin and...

541
00:18:33,141 --> 00:18:34,757
- Oh, 2 of his? - You want 2 of his?

542
00:18:34,911 --> 00:18:36,193
- Yes. - What?

543
00:18:36,780 --> 00:18:39,234
Is that possible?

544
00:18:39,610 --> 00:18:42,377
- I'll end up with him. - Hey.

545
00:18:42,750 --> 00:18:45,477
Their relationship is hilarious.

546
00:18:45,691 --> 00:18:47,420
This is something new.

547
00:18:47,421 --> 00:18:50,220
There are so many pictures of Seok Jin on my die. Look.

548
00:18:50,221 --> 00:18:53,359
Ji In, please pick.

549
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:56,259
(She will pick the second talent.)

550
00:18:56,260 --> 00:18:58,130
- "Thigh Wrestling". - Who wrote this?

551
00:18:58,131 --> 00:18:59,370
- Who was it? - Who was it?

552
00:18:59,371 --> 00:19:00,599
Me.

553
00:19:00,600 --> 00:19:01,853
- You? - Yes.

554
00:19:02,371 --> 00:19:04,769
She's really good at squeezing.

555
00:19:04,770 --> 00:19:05,952
How good is she?

556
00:19:06,371 --> 00:19:08,866
(Her squeezes are suffocating.)

557
00:19:09,681 --> 00:19:12,407
(They force you to kneel down.)

558
00:19:12,951 --> 00:19:14,880
- Yes, she is strong. - This is...

559
00:19:14,881 --> 00:19:17,480
I think Jin Hee will beat her.

560
00:19:17,481 --> 00:19:19,450
Let's try Ji Hyo's talent, "Thigh Wrestling".

561
00:19:19,451 --> 00:19:21,450
If it's another female member, they can have a match.

562
00:19:21,451 --> 00:19:23,319
If a male member wants to compete,

563
00:19:23,320 --> 00:19:26,190
they must carry her on their back while she squeezes their sides.

564
00:19:26,191 --> 00:19:27,630
- My gosh. - You'll win...

565
00:19:27,631 --> 00:19:28,700
- That's impossible. - if you can withstand five seconds.

566
00:19:28,701 --> 00:19:30,175
Ji Hyo and Jin Hee can have a match.

567
00:19:30,500 --> 00:19:32,269
This is going to be a big match.

568
00:19:32,270 --> 00:19:34,724
But you see, Ji Hyo is really strong.

569
00:19:35,540 --> 00:19:36,599
I'm curious.

570
00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:37,853
(Ji Hyo the Destroyer is a champion.)

571
00:19:38,171 --> 00:19:42,049
(No one could withstand her squeezes.)

572
00:19:42,340 --> 00:19:44,734
(Everyone kneeled before her.)

573
00:19:45,411 --> 00:19:48,177
I bet she'll be no match for Jin Hee.

574
00:19:48,211 --> 00:19:50,342
- Me too. - I think so.

575
00:19:50,721 --> 00:19:54,659
(She's full of muscles and experience.)

576
00:19:54,991 --> 00:19:57,284
(Who else needs to laugh?)

577
00:19:57,391 --> 00:19:59,108
Perhaps, it's because she's wearing black,

578
00:19:59,231 --> 00:20:00,759
but she looks much stronger...

579
00:20:00,760 --> 00:20:02,029
- than usual. - Right.

580
00:20:02,030 --> 00:20:03,200
Get ready.

581
00:20:03,201 --> 00:20:04,312
(Ji Hyo will attack first.)

582
00:20:05,270 --> 00:20:08,069
(Will she still be the champion or will Jin Hee take her spot?)

583
00:20:08,070 --> 00:20:09,569
Set, go.

584
00:20:09,570 --> 00:20:10,783
(The match begins.)

585
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:13,224
(Squeezing)

586
00:20:13,371 --> 00:20:15,480
- Ji Hyo, go. - Please use your strength.

587
00:20:15,481 --> 00:20:16,579
- Ji Hyo. - Is she doing it?

588
00:20:16,580 --> 00:20:17,940
- Ji Hyo. - Focus.

589
00:20:17,941 --> 00:20:20,049
- I don't think... - Ji Hyo.

590
00:20:20,050 --> 00:20:21,249
Don't joke around.

591
00:20:21,250 --> 00:20:22,450
- Ji Hyo. - This is your game.

592
00:20:22,451 --> 00:20:24,650
- Don't joke around. - You came up with this game.

593
00:20:24,651 --> 00:20:26,973
If you were going to lose, why did you choose it?

594
00:20:27,151 --> 00:20:28,460
Done.

595
00:20:28,461 --> 00:20:29,819
Let's switch positions.

596
00:20:29,820 --> 00:20:31,336
- You can counterattack. - Show us.

597
00:20:31,461 --> 00:20:33,259
- You can withstand it. - You can.

598
00:20:33,260 --> 00:20:34,589
- You can. - If you do, it'll be a draw.

599
00:20:34,590 --> 00:20:35,829
Ji Hyo, you need to withstand it.

600
00:20:35,830 --> 00:20:37,214
Get ready.

601
00:20:37,260 --> 00:20:38,769
Ji Hyo, squeeze.

602
00:20:38,770 --> 00:20:39,799
(Will she be able to save face?)

603
00:20:39,800 --> 00:20:41,099
Squeeze. Set, go.

604
00:20:41,100 --> 00:20:42,918
(Ji Hyo will be defending now.)

605
00:20:44,070 --> 00:20:45,758
(Her legs spread immediately.)

606
00:20:48,070 --> 00:20:49,240
(They're shocked.)

607
00:20:49,241 --> 00:20:50,725
She's so strong.

608
00:20:50,881 --> 00:20:53,173
She's a beast!

609
00:20:53,850 --> 00:20:55,049
She's shocked.

610
00:20:55,050 --> 00:20:56,868
She's insane!

611
00:20:57,320 --> 00:20:58,650
That's it. Jin Hee wins.

612
00:20:58,651 --> 00:21:00,950
(Jin Hee wins both rounds.)

613
00:21:00,951 --> 00:21:02,202
Hey.

614
00:21:02,360 --> 00:21:04,420
She had no idea someone so strong would come out.

615
00:21:04,421 --> 00:21:06,859
Jin Hee must be extremely strong.

616
00:21:06,860 --> 00:21:08,059
She'll remove all the stickers.

617
00:21:08,060 --> 00:21:09,960
Did she win the entire game?

618
00:21:09,961 --> 00:21:12,099
- She's too strong. - I know.

619
00:21:12,100 --> 00:21:14,696
- She's like a bullfrog. - A bullfrog?

620
00:21:15,141 --> 00:21:17,299
She's upgraded her level.

621
00:21:17,300 --> 00:21:18,509
She's at the highest level.

622
00:21:18,510 --> 00:21:19,670
She's too strong.

623
00:21:19,671 --> 00:21:22,609
Then how about the men compete?

624
00:21:22,610 --> 00:21:25,277
- Show us. - Show us, Ji Hyo.

625
00:21:25,411 --> 00:21:27,450
If we can withstand it, can we switch their partners?

626
00:21:27,451 --> 00:21:28,680
- Yes. - Right.

627
00:21:28,681 --> 00:21:30,150
(If they win, they can switch the stickers on her die.)

628
00:21:30,151 --> 00:21:31,849
Like this.

629
00:21:31,850 --> 00:21:33,103
(Squeezing)

630
00:21:33,850 --> 00:21:35,890
(He falls immediately.)

631
00:21:35,891 --> 00:21:37,089
I heard something break.

632
00:21:37,090 --> 00:21:39,050
- He's smiling again. - Are you okay?

633
00:21:39,290 --> 00:21:40,829
It's the virus again!

634
00:21:40,830 --> 00:21:42,259
- It is! - It's scary!

635
00:21:42,260 --> 00:21:43,513
It's happening again.

636
00:21:43,530 --> 00:21:44,900
Where did that sound come from?

637
00:21:44,901 --> 00:21:46,370
He's laughing so often today.

638
00:21:46,371 --> 00:21:47,470
Then...

639
00:21:47,471 --> 00:21:48,700
Kwang Soo is a bit...

640
00:21:48,701 --> 00:21:50,039
- Should I do it? - Will it hurt?

641
00:21:50,040 --> 00:21:51,339
- Does it really hurt? - Okay.

642
00:21:51,340 --> 00:21:52,769
This is okay.

643
00:21:52,770 --> 00:21:54,710
- If I can... - Withstand?

644
00:21:54,711 --> 00:21:55,809
- withstand it, - Here.

645
00:21:55,810 --> 00:21:56,880
I can switch the stickers, right?

646
00:21:56,881 --> 00:21:58,609
- Yes, you can switch Ji Hyo's. - Got it.

647
00:21:58,610 --> 00:22:00,226
You should be able to carry her first.

648
00:22:00,750 --> 00:22:02,349
Can you even carry me?

649
00:22:02,350 --> 00:22:03,720
(She provokes him.)

650
00:22:03,721 --> 00:22:05,749
- Can you even carry me? - Of course.

651
00:22:05,750 --> 00:22:06,962
Come on.

652
00:22:07,020 --> 00:22:08,839
He has his pride, you know?

653
00:22:09,621 --> 00:22:11,589
- He's strong. - He's still a man.

654
00:22:11,590 --> 00:22:13,752
You almost hurt my feelings.

655
00:22:14,731 --> 00:22:16,477
What if he falls ill tomorrow?

656
00:22:17,401 --> 00:22:18,573
My gosh.

657
00:22:18,600 --> 00:22:20,550
Did you hear him grunt?

658
00:22:20,871 --> 00:22:21,970
My gosh.

659
00:22:21,971 --> 00:22:23,240
(Staggering)

660
00:22:23,241 --> 00:22:24,999
Smile. Smile.

661
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:26,710
- My gosh. - Put your legs around him.

662
00:22:26,711 --> 00:22:27,852
Get ready.

663
00:22:28,471 --> 00:22:30,210
- Get ready. - Have we not begun yet?

664
00:22:30,211 --> 00:22:31,494
Ready, set, go.

665
00:22:31,641 --> 00:22:33,009
(Squeezing)

666
00:22:33,010 --> 00:22:34,666
No, no!

667
00:22:36,651 --> 00:22:38,220
(She just squeezed a little bit.)

668
00:22:38,221 --> 00:22:40,169
(Screaming)

669
00:22:41,050 --> 00:22:42,190
(Rolling)

670
00:22:42,191 --> 00:22:44,110
Oh, no! Smile!

671
00:22:44,560 --> 00:22:46,660
- Happy virus! - He's smiling!

672
00:22:46,661 --> 00:22:48,759
- That's good! It's the virus! - Hey.

673
00:22:48,760 --> 00:22:50,821
Everyone is smiling today.

674
00:22:52,100 --> 00:22:53,485
My gosh!

675
00:22:53,901 --> 00:22:56,769
- I almost died! - Don't die!

676
00:22:57,600 --> 00:22:59,170
- She must be so strong. - I'm curious.

677
00:22:59,171 --> 00:23:00,710
- I almost died! - I know how you feel.

678
00:23:00,711 --> 00:23:02,039
Is it that bad?

679
00:23:02,040 --> 00:23:03,609
How bad is this?

680
00:23:03,610 --> 00:23:04,880
- He said, "No, no!" - Se Chan.

681
00:23:04,881 --> 00:23:06,830
- This is... - It's crazy.

682
00:23:06,951 --> 00:23:08,779
Your ribs might shatter.

683
00:23:08,780 --> 00:23:10,771
It's like 100 anacondas are squeezing you.

684
00:23:11,381 --> 00:23:12,532
Try it.

685
00:23:12,621 --> 00:23:13,819
I was shocked.

686
00:23:13,820 --> 00:23:15,941
- Oh, hold on. - Wait.

687
00:23:16,760 --> 00:23:18,660
(As soon as he carries her, it feels ominous.)

688
00:23:18,661 --> 00:23:20,490
- My gosh. - I was shocked here as well.

689
00:23:20,491 --> 00:23:21,589
(He can sympathize with him.)

690
00:23:21,590 --> 00:23:23,700
- Right? - Once you carry her,

691
00:23:23,701 --> 00:23:25,387
you get shocked.

692
00:23:26,231 --> 00:23:28,640
- You think the game has started. - Really?

693
00:23:28,641 --> 00:23:29,984
My gosh.

694
00:23:30,171 --> 00:23:31,958
- Try your best. - It hasn't started yet.

695
00:23:32,471 --> 00:23:34,269
- My gosh. - He's quite resilient.

696
00:23:34,270 --> 00:23:36,039
You're right.

697
00:23:36,040 --> 00:23:39,279
Get ready, set, go.

698
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:40,594
(Squeezing)

699
00:23:41,580 --> 00:23:43,620
- What was that? - He collapsed.

700
00:23:43,621 --> 00:23:45,611
Get ready, set, go.

701
00:23:45,651 --> 00:23:48,993
(He couldn't withstand 0.1 seconds and collapse.)

702
00:23:50,590 --> 00:23:52,690
He's smiling.

703
00:23:52,691 --> 00:23:54,680
- It's really painful. - It's the happy virus.

704
00:23:55,461 --> 00:23:57,400
- How bad is it? - My gosh.

705
00:23:57,401 --> 00:23:58,670
Your ribs might break.

706
00:23:58,671 --> 00:23:59,970
- Jae Seok. - Why are you getting up there?

707
00:23:59,971 --> 00:24:01,889
- Why? - Why do you keep climbing?

708
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:03,870
(She climbs on top of the stool as if nothing happened.)

709
00:24:03,871 --> 00:24:04,940
(Why do you keep climbing?)

710
00:24:04,941 --> 00:24:06,440
You can barely breathe.

711
00:24:06,441 --> 00:24:08,509
- Come on. - Try it, then.

712
00:24:08,510 --> 00:24:10,804
- Try it. - You can barely breathe.

713
00:24:10,941 --> 00:24:13,202
I almost swore.

714
00:24:13,411 --> 00:24:16,047
(Seok Jin disappears from the monitor.)

715
00:24:18,651 --> 00:24:20,890
(He fails to pass the 1st obstacle.)

716
00:24:20,891 --> 00:24:23,089
(He gets on all fours like a sinner.)

717
00:24:23,090 --> 00:24:24,960
- Go home. - It's over.

718
00:24:24,961 --> 00:24:26,160
That's the end.

719
00:24:26,161 --> 00:24:29,160
- I'm done. - It's over.

720
00:24:29,731 --> 00:24:31,660
Some may think we're overreacting.

721
00:24:31,661 --> 00:24:33,230
- Tell the producer to try it. - Seriously.

722
00:24:33,231 --> 00:24:34,430
- Come here, Bo Pil. - Hurry.

723
00:24:34,431 --> 00:24:37,740
- Come here. - Since we're entertainers,

724
00:24:37,741 --> 00:24:39,440
some might think that we're overreacting.

725
00:24:39,441 --> 00:24:41,894
- Try it and see for yourself. - Try it.

726
00:24:42,241 --> 00:24:44,279
Express only what you feel.

727
00:24:44,280 --> 00:24:45,462
Don't pretend.

728
00:24:45,850 --> 00:24:48,033
- He's known to be honest. - You're right.

729
00:24:48,451 --> 00:24:50,680
You should bend your knees a bit.

730
00:24:50,681 --> 00:24:51,819
My gosh.

731
00:24:51,820 --> 00:24:53,789
He's not the type to show a lot of reactions.

732
00:24:53,790 --> 00:24:55,220
- Get ready. - Get ready.

733
00:24:55,221 --> 00:24:57,210
Get ready, set, go.

734
00:24:58,661 --> 00:25:00,650
(Screaming)

735
00:25:01,731 --> 00:25:05,367
(He lets out a single cry and collapses.)

736
00:25:07,830 --> 00:25:12,170
(Thanks to his genuine response, the happy virus spreads even more.)

737
00:25:12,171 --> 00:25:13,370
That didn't last long.

738
00:25:13,371 --> 00:25:14,710
He collapsed.

739
00:25:14,711 --> 00:25:17,266
Take the day off and go home.

740
00:25:17,711 --> 00:25:19,480
He just got married.

741
00:25:19,481 --> 00:25:20,910
That was a genuine reaction.

742
00:25:20,911 --> 00:25:23,547
- His cry was so sincere. - You're right.

743
00:25:24,080 --> 00:25:26,220
Jin Hee wins this round as well.

744
00:25:26,221 --> 00:25:27,664
She won again.

745
00:25:27,750 --> 00:25:30,084
You can remove the faces on Ji Hyo's die.

746
00:25:30,290 --> 00:25:31,876
- Ji Hyo's. - She's incredible.

747
00:25:32,391 --> 00:25:33,976
- She removed Se Chan's face. - Se Chan.

748
00:25:34,560 --> 00:25:36,115
Kwang Soo.

749
00:25:36,461 --> 00:25:38,855
She picked Kwang Soo every time.

750
00:25:39,070 --> 00:25:41,269
Whose face would you like to add to her die?

751
00:25:41,270 --> 00:25:42,599
Jae Seok's.

752
00:25:42,600 --> 00:25:43,799
Mine?

753
00:25:43,800 --> 00:25:46,569
Two of my faces will be attached to Ji Hyo's die.

754
00:25:46,570 --> 00:25:47,740
Shall we move on?

755
00:25:47,741 --> 00:25:49,440
Jin Hee has been winning every time.

756
00:25:49,441 --> 00:25:51,210
- You're on the lead. - She's amazing.

757
00:25:51,211 --> 00:25:52,210
Seriously.

758
00:25:52,211 --> 00:25:53,927
- Jin Hee. - No one can beat her.

759
00:25:55,211 --> 00:25:56,650
(The third talent is...)

760
00:25:56,651 --> 00:25:57,994
- "Unusual Children's Song"? - "Unusual Children's Song"?

761
00:25:58,151 --> 00:25:59,433
Whose is this?

762
00:25:59,721 --> 00:26:01,650
- It's mine. - It's yours?

763
00:26:01,651 --> 00:26:03,720
(This is Seung Hee's talent.)

764
00:26:03,721 --> 00:26:05,390
- What is this? - It's fascinating.

765
00:26:05,391 --> 00:26:07,329
Literally, it's about a children's song.

766
00:26:07,330 --> 00:26:10,529
It's a North Korean song called "Peekaboo".

767
00:26:10,530 --> 00:26:11,799
- Peekaboo? - Yes.

768
00:26:11,800 --> 00:26:13,670
- That sounds cute. - Shall we see the video first?

769
00:26:13,671 --> 00:26:14,700
Shall we?

770
00:26:14,701 --> 00:26:15,999
(It sure does look unusual.)

771
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:18,263
- It's the one with kids. - What does it mean?

772
00:26:18,701 --> 00:26:20,039
- What does it mean? - I know this.

773
00:26:20,040 --> 00:26:21,283
She's so cute.

774
00:26:24,310 --> 00:26:25,809
(I come home cheerfully)

775
00:26:25,810 --> 00:26:27,063
She's so cute.

776
00:26:28,451 --> 00:26:31,519
(The cute movements are key.)

777
00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:32,720
This is hilarious.

778
00:26:32,721 --> 00:26:33,720
(Says peekaboo to me)

779
00:26:33,721 --> 00:26:35,236
She's so cute.

780
00:26:35,790 --> 00:26:37,089
- How cute. - How cute.

781
00:26:37,090 --> 00:26:38,160
(The girl is so cute.)

782
00:26:38,161 --> 00:26:39,829
That was so adorable.

783
00:26:39,830 --> 00:26:42,053
- How cute. - My goodness.

784
00:26:42,161 --> 00:26:43,400
- My gosh! - How cute.

785
00:26:43,401 --> 00:26:45,529
- She's so pretty. - How do we do this?

786
00:26:45,530 --> 00:26:46,670
How cute.

787
00:26:46,671 --> 00:26:48,569
- Do we need to mimic her? - She is adorable.

788
00:26:48,570 --> 00:26:49,970
- Are we mimicking her? - It suits her.

789
00:26:49,971 --> 00:26:51,099
- Yes. - Right?

790
00:26:51,100 --> 00:26:52,940
- Here we go. - OH MY GIRL.

791
00:26:52,941 --> 00:26:54,539
(Seung Hee goes first.)

792
00:26:54,540 --> 00:26:56,561
(Singing)

793
00:26:57,080 --> 00:27:00,716
(I carry a rabbit backpack)

794
00:27:00,981 --> 00:27:03,849
(She's exactly like the girl.)

795
00:27:05,651 --> 00:27:06,833
She's so adorable.

796
00:27:07,350 --> 00:27:08,502
(He smiles at her like a dad would.)

797
00:27:09,590 --> 00:27:11,220
(Says peekaboo to me)

798
00:27:11,221 --> 00:27:12,829
She was so cute.

799
00:27:12,830 --> 00:27:14,029
(Says peekaboo to me)

800
00:27:14,030 --> 00:27:15,390
This is the highlight.

801
00:27:15,391 --> 00:27:16,460
(It doesn't look cute when he does it.)

802
00:27:16,461 --> 00:27:18,829
- That was so adorable. - How do we beat her?

803
00:27:18,830 --> 00:27:20,970
How... Gosh, she's brave.

804
00:27:20,971 --> 00:27:23,526
I bet So Min's ready.

805
00:27:24,441 --> 00:27:25,910
- You're right. - Can you do it?

806
00:27:25,911 --> 00:27:27,170
- Can you? - I think I can.

807
00:27:27,171 --> 00:27:28,927
She's good at such things.

808
00:27:29,040 --> 00:27:30,727
- How did it go again? - She's good at such things.

809
00:27:30,941 --> 00:27:32,140
(Wriggling)

810
00:27:32,141 --> 00:27:33,828
Why does she look so unctuous?

811
00:27:34,580 --> 00:27:36,920
(It's definitely different.)

812
00:27:36,921 --> 00:27:38,667
Do it in your own style.

813
00:27:38,791 --> 00:27:42,191
<font color="#fcc89b">[VIU Ver] SBS E461 Running Man</font>
<font color="#ff80ff">"The Couple Race"</font>
<font color="#ff5fa2">-♥ Ruo Xi ♥-</font>

814
00:27:42,260 --> 00:27:43,634
She doesn't want to lose.

815
00:27:45,560 --> 00:27:47,611
(She takes a firm stand until the end.)

816
00:27:47,691 --> 00:27:48,759
She has to dance too.

817
00:27:48,760 --> 00:27:53,446
(Says peekaboo to me)

818
00:27:54,931 --> 00:27:57,299
(I'd like to unsee that.)

819
00:27:57,300 --> 00:27:58,499
(Shaking his head)

820
00:27:58,500 --> 00:28:00,140
- Did it work? No? - How about Ji Hyo?

821
00:28:00,141 --> 00:28:02,069
- I look forward to this one. - Ji Hyo.

822
00:28:02,070 --> 00:28:03,410
- Go for it. - Ji Hyo.

823
00:28:03,411 --> 00:28:05,279
- You have to act cute. - You need to focus.

824
00:28:05,280 --> 00:28:06,809
Think back to first grade.

825
00:28:06,810 --> 00:28:08,749
I'm an elementary student.

826
00:28:08,750 --> 00:28:09,950
- An elementary student. - That's right.

827
00:28:09,951 --> 00:28:11,049
You're five years old.

828
00:28:11,050 --> 00:28:13,819
(Brainwashing herself to become an elementary student.)

829
00:28:13,820 --> 00:28:15,390
That's right.

830
00:28:15,391 --> 00:28:16,502
(She is possessed into an elementary student.)

831
00:28:16,691 --> 00:28:21,003
Wearing my rabbit

832
00:28:21,161 --> 00:28:22,817
Gosh, I can't watch this.

833
00:28:23,431 --> 00:28:24,430
I skip

834
00:28:24,431 --> 00:28:25,700
What's wrong with her?

835
00:28:25,701 --> 00:28:26,730
Anyway, she has to finish the song.

836
00:28:26,731 --> 00:28:30,437
- Seriously, what's wrong? - Guys, it's all right.

837
00:28:30,800 --> 00:28:32,053
Says peekaboo to me

838
00:28:32,441 --> 00:28:35,170
(Says peekaboo to me)

839
00:28:35,171 --> 00:28:36,710
(A mix of cuteness and awfulness)

840
00:28:36,711 --> 00:28:37,952
But you made it.

841
00:28:38,580 --> 00:28:39,849
- Hey. - You're almost 40 years old.

842
00:28:39,850 --> 00:28:40,849
Seriously.

843
00:28:40,850 --> 00:28:42,579
You shouldn't do that. Your age ends with a nine.

844
00:28:42,580 --> 00:28:44,220
When you were doing this...

845
00:28:44,221 --> 00:28:45,279
You're right.

846
00:28:45,280 --> 00:28:47,019
I thought you were asking for a cigarette.

847
00:28:47,020 --> 00:28:48,519
- Everyone. - I was asking for two.

848
00:28:48,520 --> 00:28:50,620
- Let's vote on this one. - Okay.

849
00:28:50,621 --> 00:28:52,220
- I vote Seung Hee. - I vote Seung Hee.

850
00:28:52,221 --> 00:28:53,589
- Seung Hee. - I vote Seung Hee.

851
00:28:53,590 --> 00:28:55,900
Seung Hee wins this round.

852
00:28:55,901 --> 00:28:57,230
(Seung Hee is the winner for this talent.)

853
00:28:57,231 --> 00:28:58,759
That was an obvious one.

854
00:28:58,760 --> 00:29:01,154
You can't beat that.

855
00:29:01,330 --> 00:29:04,870
Who would you like to swap, Seung Hee?

856
00:29:04,871 --> 00:29:06,992
I choose Se Chan and...

857
00:29:07,241 --> 00:29:09,339
- Jong Kook. - She chose Jong Kook.

858
00:29:09,340 --> 00:29:11,880
She chose Se Chan and Jong Kook.

859
00:29:11,881 --> 00:29:12,880
Thank you.

860
00:29:12,881 --> 00:29:15,009
Now, it's Rothy's turn who's also known as Kang Joo Hee.

861
00:29:15,010 --> 00:29:16,720
- It's my turn. - Rothy.

862
00:29:16,721 --> 00:29:17,749
Joo Hee.

863
00:29:17,750 --> 00:29:19,289
- Mimicking a singer. - Mimicking a singer.

864
00:29:19,290 --> 00:29:20,836
(The next talent that Rothy picked is to mimic singers.)

865
00:29:21,820 --> 00:29:23,059
Who's talent is this?

866
00:29:23,060 --> 00:29:24,220
It's her own.

867
00:29:24,221 --> 00:29:25,319
It's Rothy's.

868
00:29:25,320 --> 00:29:27,930
(Rothy's talent is to mimic singers.)

869
00:29:27,931 --> 00:29:29,160
- Are you good at that too? - Sounds fun.

870
00:29:29,161 --> 00:29:30,329
- Her talent. - I see.

871
00:29:30,330 --> 00:29:31,660
Who are you going to mimic?

872
00:29:31,661 --> 00:29:33,970
First, I'll mimic IU.

873
00:29:33,971 --> 00:29:35,130
(She mimics IU first.)

874
00:29:35,131 --> 00:29:38,140
When she first made her debut,

875
00:29:38,141 --> 00:29:39,940
she had that fresh voice of a rookie...

876
00:29:39,941 --> 00:29:42,680
- and had a sweet voice too. - You're right.

877
00:29:42,681 --> 00:29:46,387
The main point you have to grasp is to tell yourself...

878
00:29:46,411 --> 00:29:49,480
- that you're the cutest. - Sounds good.

879
00:29:49,721 --> 00:29:51,569
- I'll give it a go. - Go for it.

880
00:29:51,681 --> 00:29:53,019
In 1,2,3...

881
00:29:53,020 --> 00:29:54,890
Marshmallow

882
00:29:54,891 --> 00:29:56,476
- Marshmallow - She sounds very similar.

883
00:29:56,820 --> 00:29:57,960
It's so sweet

884
00:29:57,961 --> 00:29:59,607
(She sounds just like IU.)

885
00:30:00,891 --> 00:30:03,930
(The freshness of IU as a rookie and an enthusiastic voice...)

886
00:30:03,931 --> 00:30:07,102
(is the main point of "Marshmallow")

887
00:30:07,431 --> 00:30:09,299
Marshmallow

888
00:30:09,300 --> 00:30:10,451
(She mimics IU perfectly.)

889
00:30:11,741 --> 00:30:13,962
(Synchronised 200 percent)

890
00:30:14,340 --> 00:30:16,410
They sound similar.

891
00:30:16,411 --> 00:30:17,652
You sound exactly like her.

892
00:30:18,211 --> 00:30:20,210
- Who else can you mimic? - Show us more.

893
00:30:20,211 --> 00:30:22,210
- Show us, Joo Hee. - There's no end to it.

894
00:30:22,211 --> 00:30:23,920
- Who? - Soyou.

895
00:30:23,921 --> 00:30:25,220
Soyou.

896
00:30:25,221 --> 00:30:26,720
The half air and half sound technique.

897
00:30:26,721 --> 00:30:30,759
Soyou tends to give a twist with her falsetto.

898
00:30:30,760 --> 00:30:32,430
They call it the falsetto of afterlife.

899
00:30:32,431 --> 00:30:35,230
- Afterlife? - Falsetto of afterlife.

900
00:30:35,231 --> 00:30:36,442
(What is the falsetto of afterlife?)

901
00:30:36,961 --> 00:30:40,029
These days it feels like you're mine

902
00:30:40,030 --> 00:30:41,170
It seems like

903
00:30:41,171 --> 00:30:42,655
You're mine but not

904
00:30:43,701 --> 00:30:47,170
(That's the falsetto of another world.)

905
00:30:47,171 --> 00:30:48,670
I get what you mean.

906
00:30:48,671 --> 00:30:50,380
You can barely hear it.

907
00:30:50,381 --> 00:30:52,140
When you're just about to enter another world.

908
00:30:52,141 --> 00:30:54,579
(The high-pitched voice...)

909
00:30:54,580 --> 00:30:55,833
(aims for another world.)

910
00:30:56,881 --> 00:31:00,285
(A skilled song mimicker is born.)

911
00:31:00,491 --> 00:31:01,490
Goodness.

912
00:31:01,491 --> 00:31:03,541
- I didn't expect that. - I get it.

913
00:31:03,790 --> 00:31:05,620
- You got this. - Good job.

914
00:31:05,621 --> 00:31:06,930
That was good.

915
00:31:06,931 --> 00:31:08,529
- She's good. - Well done.

916
00:31:08,530 --> 00:31:10,230
- She's good. - She's something.

917
00:31:10,231 --> 00:31:11,730
Do you have more, Joo Hee?

918
00:31:11,731 --> 00:31:16,013
With Hwasa, you need a sexy voice.

919
00:31:16,441 --> 00:31:18,170
- Yes. - I like your explanations.

920
00:31:18,171 --> 00:31:19,740
- You need to be briefed first. - You have to...

921
00:31:19,741 --> 00:31:21,609
throw your voice downwards.

922
00:31:21,610 --> 00:31:24,279
- As if you're messing around. - That's right.

923
00:31:24,280 --> 00:31:25,796
(Mimicking Hwasa's singing)

924
00:31:26,610 --> 00:31:28,398
(I'm looking forward to this.)

925
00:31:28,580 --> 00:31:29,732
She's doing it.

926
00:31:30,421 --> 00:31:32,845
(Stupid)

927
00:31:34,250 --> 00:31:37,490
(She sounds more like Hwasa than Hwasa.)

928
00:31:37,491 --> 00:31:38,602
She won again.

929
00:31:38,691 --> 00:31:39,730
- Hey. - Wait.

930
00:31:39,731 --> 00:31:41,130
- She's so good. - You're good.

931
00:31:41,131 --> 00:31:43,529
- You're good. - Stupid

932
00:31:43,530 --> 00:31:44,743
- She's good. - Stupid

933
00:31:45,901 --> 00:31:48,557
- She's good. - I loved it.

934
00:31:48,800 --> 00:31:50,900
- I loved it. - That was fun.

935
00:31:50,901 --> 00:31:51,900
(So Min can't miss out on this.)

936
00:31:51,901 --> 00:31:53,688
So Min, why don't you give it a try?

937
00:31:54,340 --> 00:31:55,539
- You choose to mimic IU. - Like how you were taught.

938
00:31:55,540 --> 00:31:57,210
Try to sound the same.

939
00:31:57,211 --> 00:31:59,150
(Rothy shows an example first.)

940
00:31:59,151 --> 00:32:00,262
Give it a go.

941
00:32:00,510 --> 00:32:02,097
She's doing it.

942
00:32:02,211 --> 00:32:03,937
(Stupid)

943
00:32:05,381 --> 00:32:06,865
You really looked stupid.

944
00:32:07,691 --> 00:32:09,490
- You looked stupid. - I thought that was Joo Hyun.

945
00:32:09,491 --> 00:32:10,890
"You fool!"

946
00:32:10,891 --> 00:32:12,490
"You fool!"

947
00:32:12,491 --> 00:32:13,660
(Stupid! You fool!)

948
00:32:13,661 --> 00:32:14,859
That was it.

949
00:32:14,860 --> 00:32:17,059
Would someone like to compete against her?

950
00:32:17,060 --> 00:32:18,630
- This is... - It's impossible to beat.

951
00:32:18,631 --> 00:32:19,769
You can't go against this.

952
00:32:19,770 --> 00:32:20,870
It's unbeatable.

953
00:32:20,871 --> 00:32:22,029
In 1, 2, 3.

954
00:32:22,030 --> 00:32:23,181
- Joo Hee. - Joo Hee.

955
00:32:23,441 --> 00:32:25,039
My goodness.

956
00:32:25,040 --> 00:32:26,710
- What a relief. - Rothy.

957
00:32:26,711 --> 00:32:28,069
- Well, that was... - Can I just take it off?

958
00:32:28,070 --> 00:32:30,109
- "Stupid". - You won with that one word.

959
00:32:30,110 --> 00:32:32,109
- Stupid - A lot of talented people.

960
00:32:32,110 --> 00:32:33,910
- I'm jealous. - She took off Jong Kook.

961
00:32:33,911 --> 00:32:35,210
She chose Jong Kook.

962
00:32:35,211 --> 00:32:37,779
Last time when Seung Hun asked me this favor,

963
00:32:37,780 --> 00:32:41,819
I gladly promoted your new song. Didn't you know?

964
00:32:41,820 --> 00:32:43,390
- She stuck it back on. - That was sudden.

965
00:32:43,391 --> 00:32:44,859
What are you doing so suddenly?

966
00:32:44,860 --> 00:32:46,329
- You can't do that. - You can take it off.

967
00:32:46,330 --> 00:32:47,829
- Why did you do that? - You can take it off.

968
00:32:47,830 --> 00:32:49,799
- What's wrong with you? - I'm just messing with you.

969
00:32:49,800 --> 00:32:52,130
- He won't lay a finger on you. - "Didn't you know?"

970
00:32:52,131 --> 00:32:54,858
- Rothy... - This is difficult.

971
00:32:55,030 --> 00:32:56,499
It's difficult, but you chose me straightaway.

972
00:32:56,500 --> 00:32:57,640
(It's difficult, but you chose me straightaway.)

973
00:32:57,641 --> 00:33:00,140
- Hey. - That was so abrupt.

974
00:33:00,141 --> 00:33:01,787
Choose another one.

975
00:33:01,810 --> 00:33:03,339
- It's mine. - She chose Jae Seok.

976
00:33:03,340 --> 00:33:06,309
- Okay. - I choose Kwang Soo and Se Chan.

977
00:33:06,310 --> 00:33:08,109
Se Chan is popular.

978
00:33:08,110 --> 00:33:10,720
Kwang Soo and Se Chan.

979
00:33:10,721 --> 00:33:12,519
- Thank you. - We have two more left to go.

980
00:33:12,520 --> 00:33:13,819
We have two left.

981
00:33:13,820 --> 00:33:15,519
Whose talent is "before and after"?

982
00:33:15,520 --> 00:33:17,176
It's mine.

983
00:33:17,961 --> 00:33:20,589
(Ji In's talent, Before and After)

984
00:33:20,590 --> 00:33:21,890
It's the theatre of situations.

985
00:33:21,891 --> 00:33:23,400
(Talent from shooting over 60 adverts)

986
00:33:23,401 --> 00:33:24,759
This is before.

987
00:33:24,760 --> 00:33:25,911
(Before using fabric deodorizer)

988
00:33:26,431 --> 00:33:27,670
And after?

989
00:33:27,671 --> 00:33:29,130
(The perfect act of the after situation.)

990
00:33:29,131 --> 00:33:31,440
(The expressions that we saw from adverts.)

991
00:33:31,441 --> 00:33:33,240
Are you trying to extend your advert contract?

992
00:33:33,241 --> 00:33:35,261
(Haha catches why Ji In decided to do it as her talent.)

993
00:33:36,211 --> 00:33:37,480
(Her goal is to extend her contract.)

994
00:33:37,481 --> 00:33:38,955
She's trying to look good for the advertiser.

995
00:33:39,280 --> 00:33:40,650
- I remember it. - She wants a call from them.

996
00:33:40,651 --> 00:33:42,009
She did a good job.

997
00:33:42,010 --> 00:33:43,849
Ji In did a good job with this.

998
00:33:43,850 --> 00:33:45,870
Let's come to the conclusion and let Ji In be the winner.

999
00:33:47,391 --> 00:33:48,849
- This is the last one. - Yes.

1000
00:33:48,850 --> 00:33:50,638
- What's "arm talent"? - Arm talent.

1001
00:33:51,860 --> 00:33:54,230
(Jin Hee can cross back her arms and let her fingers touch.)

1002
00:33:54,231 --> 00:33:55,289
That is no joke.

1003
00:33:55,290 --> 00:33:57,599
Try it, So Min. I think you'll be able to do it.

1004
00:33:57,600 --> 00:33:59,970
- Hold it up here. - You're quite close.

1005
00:33:59,971 --> 00:34:01,430
Hold it there.

1006
00:34:01,431 --> 00:34:02,940
Doesn't this look risque?

1007
00:34:02,941 --> 00:34:05,839
Why is your hand down here?

1008
00:34:05,840 --> 00:34:07,410
(PG19 hand movement)

1009
00:34:07,411 --> 00:34:08,410
Why is your hand down here?

1010
00:34:08,411 --> 00:34:10,140
(Why is your hand down here?)

1011
00:34:10,141 --> 00:34:11,879
Goodness.

1012
00:34:11,880 --> 00:34:12,879
Can you push it down?

1013
00:34:12,880 --> 00:34:14,509
Seok Jin can do it.

1014
00:34:14,510 --> 00:34:15,680
- Can he? - Seok Jin.

1015
00:34:15,681 --> 00:34:17,720
(Seok Jin can do it?)

1016
00:34:17,721 --> 00:34:19,033
I'm doing it.

1017
00:34:19,391 --> 00:34:20,390
Stay still.

1018
00:34:20,391 --> 00:34:21,490
(A successful illusion)

1019
00:34:21,491 --> 00:34:22,859
Seok Jin.

1020
00:34:22,860 --> 00:34:26,324
You're a true comedian.

1021
00:34:26,331 --> 00:34:28,529
- I was taken aback. - They're alive.

1022
00:34:28,530 --> 00:34:30,729
- So now... - What happens to Jin Hee?

1023
00:34:30,730 --> 00:34:32,700
Jin Hee is the winner again.

1024
00:34:32,701 --> 00:34:33,912
(Jin Hee is a true conman, winning 3 games out of 6.)

1025
00:34:35,230 --> 00:34:38,169
We will start throwing the dice which will decide your partners.

1026
00:34:38,170 --> 00:34:39,339
- Rothy. - Rothy can go first.

1027
00:34:39,340 --> 00:34:41,734
- Rothy. - In 1, 2, 3.

1028
00:34:42,710 --> 00:34:44,910
(A male member who will become Rothy's partner is...)

1029
00:34:44,911 --> 00:34:45,910
(Lee Kwang Soo)

1030
00:34:45,911 --> 00:34:47,800
Lee Kwang Soo is out now.

1031
00:34:48,681 --> 00:34:50,919
Seok Jin is all over this dice.

1032
00:34:50,920 --> 00:34:53,520
- So Min, just come here. - Seok Jin.

1033
00:34:53,521 --> 00:34:56,419
- Jee Seok Jin. - Yang Se Chan.

1034
00:34:56,420 --> 00:34:59,623
Yang Se Chan.

1035
00:34:59,931 --> 00:35:02,529
(With 50 percent chance, nothing has changed.)

1036
00:35:02,530 --> 00:35:04,160
(Seok Jin is chosen.)

1037
00:35:04,161 --> 00:35:06,330
- Hey. - Well...

1038
00:35:06,331 --> 00:35:08,997
- You had no choice. - I'm satisfied.

1039
00:35:09,130 --> 00:35:10,500
I'll accept it quickly.

1040
00:35:10,501 --> 00:35:14,439
Get together as teams and we'll start introducing the games.

1041
00:35:14,440 --> 00:35:18,076
All I know is that our team will win all the games.

1042
00:35:18,510 --> 00:35:19,609
You have no rival in the world.

1043
00:35:19,610 --> 00:35:23,319
Winners will get a prize but losers will receive a big penalty.

1044
00:35:23,320 --> 00:35:24,720
It's a couple race where you stay together to survive,

1045
00:35:24,721 --> 00:35:26,319
but get apart if you want to do better alone.

1046
00:35:26,320 --> 00:35:28,341
I want to do better alone.

1047
00:35:28,951 --> 00:35:30,419
You have to get apart from each other?

1048
00:35:30,420 --> 00:35:32,419
There will be a total 4 rounds with 6 couples.

1049
00:35:32,420 --> 00:35:35,729
Every round, the winning couple will select a prize badge...

1050
00:35:35,730 --> 00:35:38,330
while the losers will select a penalty badge.

1051
00:35:38,331 --> 00:35:39,430
When the whole game finishes,

1052
00:35:39,431 --> 00:35:42,799
you will minus the number of penalty badge from the prize badge.

1053
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:44,470
The winning team will receive a Korean beef set...

1054
00:35:44,471 --> 00:35:46,310
and be exempted from the penalty.

1055
00:35:46,311 --> 00:35:47,939
- Exempted from the penalty. - Korean beef set.

1056
00:35:47,940 --> 00:35:50,040
- Let's have some Korean beef. - I'm excited about this.

1057
00:35:50,041 --> 00:35:52,810
On the other hand, the losing team...

1058
00:35:52,811 --> 00:35:55,109
will choose another team...

1059
00:35:55,110 --> 00:35:56,720
to go through the penalty together.

1060
00:35:56,721 --> 00:35:58,120
You have to be nice to each other.

1061
00:35:58,121 --> 00:36:00,790
I'm worried that people will want to choose you.

1062
00:36:00,791 --> 00:36:02,819
- You're the problem. - They will choose you.

1063
00:36:02,820 --> 00:36:05,319
We will reveal the video that shows the penalty.

1064
00:36:05,320 --> 00:36:06,890
- Why are you doing this? - There's a video?

1065
00:36:06,891 --> 00:36:08,229
What is it that they even prepared a video clip for this?

1066
00:36:08,230 --> 00:36:09,846
Come on.

1067
00:36:10,860 --> 00:36:12,011
- What? - My goodness.

1068
00:36:12,230 --> 00:36:13,412
- What? - What is it?

1069
00:36:13,931 --> 00:36:16,566
(The penalty of the losing couple and the chosen couple.)

1070
00:36:17,101 --> 00:36:18,514
Where are you going up until?

1071
00:36:18,541 --> 00:36:20,894
- That's so high. - That's too high.

1072
00:36:22,840 --> 00:36:25,040
Don't you do that to practice your skydive?

1073
00:36:25,041 --> 00:36:26,049
Gosh.

1074
00:36:26,050 --> 00:36:27,109
Really?

1075
00:36:27,110 --> 00:36:28,109
(Indoor skydiving)

1076
00:36:28,110 --> 00:36:31,009
(The high-tech penalty that is perfect for cowardly members.)

1077
00:36:32,181 --> 00:36:35,150
(Which two couples will have to go through this?)

1078
00:36:36,590 --> 00:36:39,020
Were they screaming?

1079
00:36:39,021 --> 00:36:40,430
Is it safe for your bones?

1080
00:36:40,431 --> 00:36:41,490
But...

1081
00:36:41,491 --> 00:36:43,319
How are we supposed to do that?

1082
00:36:43,661 --> 00:36:45,959
You'll be able to experience what skydiving is like.

1083
00:36:45,960 --> 00:36:48,970
Losers will have to complete the indoor skydive.

1084
00:36:48,971 --> 00:36:50,399
Indoor skydiving?

1085
00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:51,870
Don't you bump into walls?

1086
00:36:51,871 --> 00:36:54,310
We will move to our first location.

1087
00:36:54,311 --> 00:36:55,339
- Let's go. - Let's go.

1088
00:36:55,340 --> 00:36:56,592
Let's go.

1089
00:36:57,741 --> 00:37:00,109
(Today's first mission with prizes and penalties.)

1090
00:37:00,110 --> 00:37:01,868
What is this?

1091
00:37:02,411 --> 00:37:04,945
- What is this? - What's going on today?

1092
00:37:05,050 --> 00:37:07,919
This is the first mission that will give you the chance to obtain...

1093
00:37:07,920 --> 00:37:10,520
a prize badge. "Endure the weight if you want the prize."

1094
00:37:10,521 --> 00:37:12,160
Yes, endure the weight.

1095
00:37:12,161 --> 00:37:15,029
You will team up with two other couples.

1096
00:37:15,030 --> 00:37:18,600
A male member from each team will lie down on the benches.

1097
00:37:18,601 --> 00:37:21,500
The female member will have to bring as many objects...

1098
00:37:21,501 --> 00:37:24,339
within two minutes and place it on top of the male member.

1099
00:37:24,340 --> 00:37:27,540
We will only measure the total weight...

1100
00:37:27,541 --> 00:37:29,864
of the objects that are placed on top of the body.

1101
00:37:30,141 --> 00:37:32,009
- Objects that are on the body? - That's correct.

1102
00:37:32,010 --> 00:37:33,850
We have to endure that weight.

1103
00:37:33,851 --> 00:37:36,950
However, a couple from each team can distract the male members...

1104
00:37:36,951 --> 00:37:39,689
and tickle their feet.

1105
00:37:39,690 --> 00:37:43,020
Objects that have fallen off the body will be excluded.

1106
00:37:43,021 --> 00:37:44,390
I'm sure Jae Seok won't be able to win this game.

1107
00:37:44,391 --> 00:37:47,729
Let's first divide you into two groups.

1108
00:37:47,730 --> 00:37:51,229
(Jae-Ha-Kwang versus Seok-Jong-Se)

1109
00:37:51,230 --> 00:37:53,270
Will one couple from each team please step forward?

1110
00:37:53,271 --> 00:37:54,614
It hurts.

1111
00:37:54,871 --> 00:37:56,870
- It really hurts. - Get ready.

1112
00:37:56,871 --> 00:37:57,939
I know where to poke.

1113
00:37:57,940 --> 00:37:59,140
Don't lift your leg up.

1114
00:37:59,141 --> 00:38:00,540
- We didn't poke you yet. - It hurts.

1115
00:38:00,541 --> 00:38:01,870
We didn't do anything yet.

1116
00:38:01,871 --> 00:38:02,879
Okay.

1117
00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:04,109
How can I grab them?

1118
00:38:04,110 --> 00:38:05,740
Like this.

1119
00:38:05,741 --> 00:38:08,310
I can't stack anything if he's here.

1120
00:38:08,311 --> 00:38:09,979
- You can't be there. - Hey.

1121
00:38:09,980 --> 00:38:11,365
You can't be here.

1122
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:14,773
(Move! Jong Kook kicks Kwang Soo's butt as a punishment.)

1123
00:38:14,920 --> 00:38:16,359
Like I said, you can't be here.

1124
00:38:16,360 --> 00:38:17,560
- Oh, dear. - Move.

1125
00:38:17,561 --> 00:38:18,589
(Why does he let himself get targeted like that?)

1126
00:38:18,590 --> 00:38:19,759
Are you sure about this?

1127
00:38:19,760 --> 00:38:21,390
It's still possible, right?

1128
00:38:21,391 --> 00:38:22,529
Be my guest then.

1129
00:38:22,530 --> 00:38:24,146
(His butt gets punished again.)

1130
00:38:24,260 --> 00:38:26,017
Be my guest.

1131
00:38:26,230 --> 00:38:28,998
- Go ahead. - Okay. I'll try another way.

1132
00:38:29,601 --> 00:38:31,540
- I won't do that. - No?

1133
00:38:31,541 --> 00:38:32,914
I trust you, Kwang Soo.

1134
00:38:33,141 --> 00:38:34,424
You'll only play a single game.

1135
00:38:35,271 --> 00:38:36,379
Get ready...

1136
00:38:36,380 --> 00:38:38,379
(Ji In and Ji Hyo will go head to head.)

1137
00:38:38,380 --> 00:38:39,649
(They only have 2 minutes.)

1138
00:38:39,650 --> 00:38:41,149
Go, Ji In!

1139
00:38:41,150 --> 00:38:42,493
(Tightly grabbing)

1140
00:38:43,621 --> 00:38:46,290
(Ji Hyo starts off by stopping her opponent.)

1141
00:38:46,291 --> 00:38:47,919
(What?)

1142
00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:49,980
(Things are getting wilder.)

1143
00:38:50,920 --> 00:38:53,759
(Is this how it's supposed to be?)

1144
00:38:53,760 --> 00:38:55,060
Be careful, guys.

1145
00:38:55,061 --> 00:38:56,677
What's going on? Guys?

1146
00:38:56,831 --> 00:38:58,720
Guys, what are you doing?

1147
00:38:59,101 --> 00:39:00,313
Make sure you win!

1148
00:39:00,800 --> 00:39:03,339
(Song Ji In versus Song Ji Hyo)

1149
00:39:03,340 --> 00:39:04,654
What's gotten into you two?

1150
00:39:04,940 --> 00:39:05,970
What is this?

1151
00:39:05,971 --> 00:39:07,339
(Everyone forgets about the game and watch them.)

1152
00:39:07,340 --> 00:39:08,410
What are you doing?

1153
00:39:08,411 --> 00:39:09,723
Somebody please stop them.

1154
00:39:10,081 --> 00:39:11,640
(It's a new interpretation of the game.)

1155
00:39:11,641 --> 00:39:13,549
- What... - Be careful.

1156
00:39:13,550 --> 00:39:14,779
What are you two doing?

1157
00:39:14,780 --> 00:39:17,049
Just go and get the items!

1158
00:39:17,050 --> 00:39:18,120
(After fighting for the better spot, they go over to the items.)

1159
00:39:18,121 --> 00:39:19,180
(Ji Hyo, hurry!)

1160
00:39:19,181 --> 00:39:20,301
That's it.

1161
00:39:21,590 --> 00:39:23,189
Wait, why are you grabbing that?

1162
00:39:23,190 --> 00:39:25,390
- My gosh. - Stack them up.

1163
00:39:25,391 --> 00:39:26,875
- Come on. - What a mess.

1164
00:39:27,760 --> 00:39:29,359
(Ji In isn't good at playing games though.)

1165
00:39:29,360 --> 00:39:31,724
Hold on. At least let my face show!

1166
00:39:32,331 --> 00:39:34,229
(The first item covers Haha's face.)

1167
00:39:34,230 --> 00:39:35,745
It hurts!

1168
00:39:36,541 --> 00:39:38,490
(Just then)

1169
00:39:39,141 --> 00:39:41,370
(Ji Hyo brings in a mattress.)

1170
00:39:41,371 --> 00:39:42,824
Stack it on you.

1171
00:39:42,871 --> 00:39:45,209
Still... Okay, you're good.

1172
00:39:45,210 --> 00:39:46,509
(We should make it harder for him!)

1173
00:39:46,510 --> 00:39:49,136
- It hurts! - What now?

1174
00:39:49,820 --> 00:39:51,568
Kwang Soo's in the way.

1175
00:39:52,081 --> 00:39:53,189
Hold on.

1176
00:39:53,190 --> 00:39:54,390
Fine, I won't do it!

1177
00:39:54,391 --> 00:39:56,620
Rothy, don't. Hey, we've stopped.

1178
00:39:56,621 --> 00:39:58,319
We won't do it anymore.

1179
00:39:58,320 --> 00:40:00,179
(Why? Just do what you want.)

1180
00:40:00,360 --> 00:40:01,529
(Haha screams and makes a big fuss.)

1181
00:40:01,530 --> 00:40:02,629
It hurts.

1182
00:40:02,630 --> 00:40:04,399
How can this hurt? Stop lying.

1183
00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:05,500
It's only a feather.

1184
00:40:05,501 --> 00:40:07,029
It's a feather!

1185
00:40:07,030 --> 00:40:08,445
How can a feather hurt?

1186
00:40:08,530 --> 00:40:10,964
What do you think you're doing? Where did she go?

1187
00:40:12,340 --> 00:40:13,470
Hey, it's a ballpoint pen.

1188
00:40:13,471 --> 00:40:14,810
It's really a pen.

1189
00:40:14,811 --> 00:40:18,839
(They thought it was rubber.)

1190
00:40:18,840 --> 00:40:20,295
That's why I said it hurts!

1191
00:40:20,780 --> 00:40:22,149
I said it hurts!

1192
00:40:22,150 --> 00:40:23,379
It was a pen all along.

1193
00:40:23,380 --> 00:40:24,549
(So he wasn't faking it.)

1194
00:40:24,550 --> 00:40:25,879
(Both teams only have 5 seconds left.)

1195
00:40:25,880 --> 00:40:27,335
Don't help the items stay on there.

1196
00:40:27,521 --> 00:40:29,712
(Ji Hyo even stacked an iron pot.)

1197
00:40:30,121 --> 00:40:31,160
- One! - Time's up.

1198
00:40:31,161 --> 00:40:33,251
(Both ladies did their best during the 2 minutes.)

1199
00:40:33,690 --> 00:40:35,060
Time's up.

1200
00:40:35,061 --> 00:40:36,445
Time's up. Stop.

1201
00:40:36,860 --> 00:40:38,259
- There we go. - You have to stop now.

1202
00:40:38,260 --> 00:40:39,459
I'm not holding onto them.

1203
00:40:39,460 --> 00:40:40,899
- Look. - My gosh.

1204
00:40:40,900 --> 00:40:41,930
I see a similar amount.

1205
00:40:41,931 --> 00:40:43,100
Do we just weigh these?

1206
00:40:43,101 --> 00:40:44,169
Help her with the other end.

1207
00:40:44,170 --> 00:40:45,799
(He breathes fresh air for the first time in 2 minutes.)

1208
00:40:45,800 --> 00:40:47,993
Are you sure this is how the game is played?

1209
00:40:48,710 --> 00:40:50,629
(The sole of his foot is a mess.)

1210
00:40:51,181 --> 00:40:52,310
Unbelievable.

1211
00:40:52,311 --> 00:40:54,098
A few holes have been drilled.

1212
00:40:54,980 --> 00:40:56,738
It was good for blood circulation though.

1213
00:40:57,021 --> 00:40:58,495
It's good for your health.

1214
00:40:58,650 --> 00:41:00,020
Do you know...

1215
00:41:00,021 --> 00:41:01,750
what we should focus on though?

1216
00:41:01,751 --> 00:41:03,660
At the beginning, Ji Hyo and Ji In...

1217
00:41:03,661 --> 00:41:05,120
- really went for it. - I know.

1218
00:41:05,121 --> 00:41:06,560
- It was for real. - Yes, it was.

1219
00:41:06,561 --> 00:41:08,580
- They meant it. - It was truly on.

1220
00:41:08,960 --> 00:41:10,959
It began here, but the game continued over there.

1221
00:41:10,960 --> 00:41:12,229
They weren't kidding.

1222
00:41:12,230 --> 00:41:13,870
I haven't seen girls fight like this since middle school.

1223
00:41:13,871 --> 00:41:15,430
I don't know which schools they're from,

1224
00:41:15,431 --> 00:41:17,669
but the two best fighters went head to head.

1225
00:41:17,670 --> 00:41:19,709
(I'm the best in this neighborhood.)

1226
00:41:19,710 --> 00:41:21,609
Jin Hee just laughed though with her arms crossed.

1227
00:41:21,610 --> 00:41:22,870
(When the two of them went for it, Jin Hee laughed.)

1228
00:41:22,871 --> 00:41:25,479
(They seem adorable.)

1229
00:41:25,480 --> 00:41:26,549
(The real winner is yet to be revealed.)

1230
00:41:26,550 --> 00:41:28,009
Here's the last one.

1231
00:41:28,010 --> 00:41:29,526
You didn't stack much.

1232
00:41:29,780 --> 00:41:32,350
We managed 81kg.

1233
00:41:32,351 --> 00:41:34,319
(Jae-Ha-Kwang managed 81kg.)

1234
00:41:34,320 --> 00:41:37,390
(Ji Hyo must've stacked more items to win.)

1235
00:41:37,391 --> 00:41:38,790
(What's the result?)

1236
00:41:38,791 --> 00:41:39,830
65.5kg.

1237
00:41:39,831 --> 00:41:41,390
(Seok-Jong-Se managed 65.5kg.)

1238
00:41:41,391 --> 00:41:42,859
(81kg versus 65.5kg)

1239
00:41:42,860 --> 00:41:46,259
(Jae-Ha-Kwang wins!)

1240
00:41:46,260 --> 00:41:48,229
(We lost.)

1241
00:41:48,230 --> 00:41:49,370
(We lost, but it was a good game.)

1242
00:41:49,371 --> 00:41:50,500
Good job.

1243
00:41:50,501 --> 00:41:51,799
What time is it?

1244
00:41:51,800 --> 00:41:53,387
Rothy!

1245
00:41:53,911 --> 00:41:55,658
It doesn't end here.

1246
00:41:55,871 --> 00:41:57,640
The winning three teams...

1247
00:41:57,641 --> 00:41:59,609
will choose the prize OX card.

1248
00:41:59,610 --> 00:42:01,109
The losing three teams...

1249
00:42:01,110 --> 00:42:03,250
will choose the penalty OX card.

1250
00:42:03,251 --> 00:42:04,620
(What do these cards mean?)

1251
00:42:04,621 --> 00:42:05,850
What are these OX cards?

1252
00:42:05,851 --> 00:42:07,490
Let me give you an example.

1253
00:42:07,491 --> 00:42:11,189
Every time you win, you will choose a prize OX card.

1254
00:42:11,190 --> 00:42:13,615
If all three teams choose O card,

1255
00:42:13,891 --> 00:42:16,152
then you'll all receive a prize badge.

1256
00:42:16,291 --> 00:42:18,029
If you all choose an X card,

1257
00:42:18,030 --> 00:42:19,529
you will receive nothing.

1258
00:42:19,530 --> 00:42:21,470
If one couple choose a different card,

1259
00:42:21,471 --> 00:42:23,569
no matter what that card is,

1260
00:42:23,570 --> 00:42:26,740
that couple will receive two prize badges...

1261
00:42:26,741 --> 00:42:28,169
while the others receive nothing.

1262
00:42:28,170 --> 00:42:30,009
- We might not receive anything. - Exactly.

1263
00:42:30,010 --> 00:42:31,410
- Meanwhile... - Kwang Soo, gosh.

1264
00:42:31,411 --> 00:42:34,810
The losing three couples will also choose a card.

1265
00:42:34,811 --> 00:42:37,319
If all three couples chooses X card,

1266
00:42:37,320 --> 00:42:39,774
then you'll all receive a penalty badge.

1267
00:42:40,221 --> 00:42:42,549
If you all choose O card,

1268
00:42:42,550 --> 00:42:44,378
you'll receive nothing.

1269
00:42:44,891 --> 00:42:46,490
That will never happen though.

1270
00:42:46,491 --> 00:42:49,459
However, if one team chooses a different card,

1271
00:42:49,460 --> 00:42:51,985
that couple will receive a prize badge instead.

1272
00:42:52,831 --> 00:42:54,029
You can win a prize badge even if you lose.

1273
00:42:54,030 --> 00:42:56,029
The other two couples will receive two penalty badges.

1274
00:42:56,030 --> 00:42:58,200
The options are very tempting today.

1275
00:42:58,201 --> 00:43:00,569
It's all about not being greedy.

1276
00:43:00,570 --> 00:43:02,339
(Being the odd one out will be rewarding.)

1277
00:43:02,340 --> 00:43:05,279
(O or X Card Choice Scenario)

1278
00:43:05,280 --> 00:43:07,877
Does everyone remember the rules?

1279
00:43:08,251 --> 00:43:10,720
- X, X, and O. - The team with a different card...

1280
00:43:10,721 --> 00:43:12,720
will receive two prize badges.

1281
00:43:12,721 --> 00:43:14,390
I'm sure that team will lose.

1282
00:43:14,391 --> 00:43:16,885
Just look at Kwang Soo.

1283
00:43:17,721 --> 00:43:18,959
This is what we should choose.

1284
00:43:18,960 --> 00:43:20,589
I'll hold onto this one.

1285
00:43:20,590 --> 00:43:22,689
(Kwang Soo emits a feeling of betrayal.)

1286
00:43:22,690 --> 00:43:24,129
We should choose O card for now.

1287
00:43:24,130 --> 00:43:25,500
Doesn't it look like Jin Hee's warming up?

1288
00:43:25,501 --> 00:43:26,914
(Kwang Soo, take a look.)

1289
00:43:26,971 --> 00:43:28,330
She's a human weapon.

1290
00:43:28,331 --> 00:43:29,939
(The human weapon awaits to punish the traitor.)

1291
00:43:29,940 --> 00:43:31,820
What will you do if I choose O card?

1292
00:43:32,001 --> 00:43:33,509
- Jin Hee? - That should be your only choice.

1293
00:43:33,510 --> 00:43:35,339
- Can you kick up high? - A high kick?

1294
00:43:35,340 --> 00:43:36,795
- Show him. - Okay.

1295
00:43:37,780 --> 00:43:40,609
That'll really hurt.

1296
00:43:40,610 --> 00:43:42,095
- Even I'm scared. - She only needs to kick once.

1297
00:43:42,351 --> 00:43:43,836
Let us discuss again.

1298
00:43:46,081 --> 00:43:48,211
Let's just each win a badge.

1299
00:43:48,550 --> 00:43:50,106
You know what that kick will do to you.

1300
00:43:50,920 --> 00:43:52,304
(Screeching)

1301
00:43:52,721 --> 00:43:53,890
- What's that? - The sound you'll make.

1302
00:43:53,891 --> 00:43:55,229
- That's how I'll sound? - Yes.

1303
00:43:55,230 --> 00:43:56,745
I heard a wailing sound.

1304
00:43:57,230 --> 00:43:59,830
Kwang Soo, don't give in so easily.

1305
00:43:59,831 --> 00:44:02,497
You shouldn't get scared on TV like this.

1306
00:44:03,440 --> 00:44:06,875
(Kwang Soo, I know you're a decent man.)

1307
00:44:07,510 --> 00:44:08,669
(Kwang Soo's biggest dilemma)

1308
00:44:08,670 --> 00:44:09,939
All right then. In 1...

1309
00:44:09,940 --> 00:44:13,040
(Receiving two badges alone can save them from receiving a penalty.)

1310
00:44:13,041 --> 00:44:14,310
(Will Kwang Soo choose to be loyal instead?)

1311
00:44:14,311 --> 00:44:16,269
- In 1... - In 1, 2, 3!

1312
00:44:17,050 --> 00:44:18,049
Show it to the camera.

1313
00:44:18,050 --> 00:44:20,390
(Haha and Ji In, Jae Seok and Jin Hee)

1314
00:44:20,391 --> 00:44:24,400
(Kwang Soo and Rothy)

1315
00:44:24,460 --> 00:44:26,220
- They chose X card. - Who?

1316
00:44:26,221 --> 00:44:27,371
(Kwang Soo and Rothy betrayed the others.)

1317
00:44:27,460 --> 00:44:28,990
So you chose X card.

1318
00:44:28,991 --> 00:44:30,060
I knew it.

1319
00:44:30,061 --> 00:44:31,399
- He chose X card. - It's an X card.

1320
00:44:31,400 --> 00:44:32,844
He chose the X card.

1321
00:44:32,931 --> 00:44:34,970
I knew it. He's in the lead now.

1322
00:44:34,971 --> 00:44:37,100
- He's in the lead now. - You're right.

1323
00:44:37,101 --> 00:44:38,413
He's in the lead.

1324
00:44:39,141 --> 00:44:41,240
I tagged him on social media with this phrase,

1325
00:44:41,241 --> 00:44:43,339
but he earned his money by betraying people.

1326
00:44:43,340 --> 00:44:45,839
(He's earning money by betraying others yet again.)

1327
00:44:45,840 --> 00:44:47,810
This is his job, so we should understand.

1328
00:44:47,811 --> 00:44:49,830
You three should choose your cards too.

1329
00:44:49,980 --> 00:44:51,971
We've already made our choice.

1330
00:44:52,050 --> 00:44:53,720
No one's hitting anyone on our side.

1331
00:44:53,721 --> 00:44:56,990
No one will receive a penalty badge if we all choose O card.

1332
00:44:56,991 --> 00:44:58,303
Let's keep the peace.

1333
00:44:58,460 --> 00:45:00,060
Are you ready? One...

1334
00:45:00,061 --> 00:45:02,229
Be kind and generous. Only O card is the right choice.

1335
00:45:02,230 --> 00:45:04,180
- Let's be a team. - In 1, 2,

1336
00:45:04,260 --> 00:45:05,614
and 3, show the camera.

1337
00:45:06,491 --> 00:45:08,346
- Let's be a team. - In 1, 2,

1338
00:45:08,347 --> 00:45:09,702
and 3, show the camera.

1339
00:45:10,378 --> 00:45:13,409
(Only Seok Jin and So Min chose X card.)

1340
00:45:15,619 --> 00:45:16,917
- See? - What happened?

1341
00:45:16,918 --> 00:45:18,048
(The other two teams receive 2 penalty badges.)

1342
00:45:18,049 --> 00:45:20,087
What did I tell you?

1343
00:45:20,088 --> 00:45:22,048
Congratulations!

1344
00:45:22,759 --> 00:45:25,058
(Betrayal is everywhere just like a normal day in Running Man.)

1345
00:45:25,059 --> 00:45:26,443
I should've changed it at the last minute.

1346
00:45:28,059 --> 00:45:30,267
The couple in the last place will choose...

1347
00:45:30,268 --> 00:45:31,837
another couple to receive the penalty too.

1348
00:45:31,838 --> 00:45:33,638
- They'll choose another couple? - Right.

1349
00:45:33,639 --> 00:45:35,138
- They'll choose? - I see.

1350
00:45:35,139 --> 00:45:36,138
So one can be a target.

1351
00:45:36,139 --> 00:45:38,837
- Let's head to our next location. - Let's go!

1352
00:45:38,838 --> 00:45:40,477
(What other mission awaits them this time?)

1353
00:45:40,478 --> 00:45:41,720
Let's go!

1354
00:45:42,179 --> 00:45:44,228
- Are we off to eat? - Let's go, everybody.

1355
00:45:44,279 --> 00:45:45,591
Okay, everybody.

1356
00:45:45,878 --> 00:45:48,504
- Okay, Okay. - Okay, everybody.

1357
00:45:49,088 --> 00:45:52,219
Seung Hee, your mouth is getting similar to Se Chan's.

1358
00:45:52,588 --> 00:45:53,917
Right?

1359
00:45:53,918 --> 00:45:55,201
Seriously?

1360
00:45:55,489 --> 00:45:57,407
Is that how far my mouth sticks out?

1361
00:45:57,429 --> 00:45:58,610
She apologized.

1362
00:45:58,659 --> 00:46:00,397
Se Chan's popular among the ladies.

1363
00:46:00,398 --> 00:46:01,698
- What? - The ladies...

1364
00:46:01,699 --> 00:46:03,727
I was popular among women at that age as well.

1365
00:46:03,728 --> 00:46:04,928
- So Min. - Yes?

1366
00:46:04,929 --> 00:46:06,150
You're one of them.

1367
00:46:06,199 --> 00:46:08,320
- Me? You think I like Se Chan? - Yes.

1368
00:46:08,338 --> 00:46:10,490
(She likes him!)

1369
00:46:10,639 --> 00:46:12,408
- So Min likes him. - As if.

1370
00:46:12,409 --> 00:46:13,578
You like him.

1371
00:46:13,579 --> 00:46:14,820
Do I?

1372
00:46:16,648 --> 00:46:18,408
- What do you like about him? - Guys, stop it.

1373
00:46:18,409 --> 00:46:20,065
You're making Seok Jin jealous.

1374
00:46:21,378 --> 00:46:23,618
She's supposed to be having a love line with Seok Jin.

1375
00:46:23,619 --> 00:46:26,245
I'm not sure if it will work out, though.

1376
00:46:26,759 --> 00:46:29,052
Our country isn't that...

1377
00:46:29,059 --> 00:46:30,928
It's not that open.

1378
00:46:30,929 --> 00:46:33,258
I've been doing variety shows for a long time,

1379
00:46:33,259 --> 00:46:35,698
- but I've never done one like this. - It's a first.

1380
00:46:35,699 --> 00:46:37,098
- It's a first. - I've never seen it on TV.

1381
00:46:37,099 --> 00:46:38,543
So Min actually...

1382
00:46:38,838 --> 00:46:41,138
- does have feelings for Se Chan. - She likes him.

1383
00:46:41,139 --> 00:46:44,107
I personally think they look cute together.

1384
00:46:44,108 --> 00:46:45,408
- No. - No.

1385
00:46:45,409 --> 00:46:47,138
They don't look cute together.

1386
00:46:47,139 --> 00:46:49,207
Are you getting jealous?

1387
00:46:49,208 --> 00:46:51,078
I'm not even saying anything.

1388
00:46:51,079 --> 00:46:52,377
(I'm not even saying anything.)

1389
00:46:52,378 --> 00:46:55,076
And So Min can't make Se Chan fall for her.

1390
00:46:55,489 --> 00:46:56,618
- Me? - Yes.

1391
00:46:56,619 --> 00:46:58,687
Me? I'm just not trying.

1392
00:46:58,688 --> 00:47:00,072
Really? Can you seduce him?

1393
00:47:00,518 --> 00:47:02,488
Will he fall for you if you try?

1394
00:47:02,489 --> 00:47:03,758
I can seduce him in a day.

1395
00:47:03,759 --> 00:47:05,758
(I can seduce him in a day.)

1396
00:47:05,759 --> 00:47:06,798
Just one day.

1397
00:47:06,799 --> 00:47:08,767
Haha,

1398
00:47:08,768 --> 00:47:10,198
- I can say for sure... - Hey.

1399
00:47:10,199 --> 00:47:11,397
that it will only take me half a day.

1400
00:47:11,398 --> 00:47:12,868
Come over to my place later on.

1401
00:47:12,869 --> 00:47:15,037
(Come over to my place later on!)

1402
00:47:15,038 --> 00:47:16,707
(They will open up a seducing class after the shoot.)

1403
00:47:16,708 --> 00:47:18,368
I'll show you.

1404
00:47:18,369 --> 00:47:20,025
- How exciting. - I'm dumbfounded.

1405
00:47:20,639 --> 00:47:23,448
So Min's family really likes Se Chan.

1406
00:47:23,449 --> 00:47:25,317
- Her mother really likes him. - Yes.

1407
00:47:25,318 --> 00:47:27,618
My mom thinks of all single men...

1408
00:47:27,619 --> 00:47:29,218
as a candidate for my spouse.

1409
00:47:29,219 --> 00:47:30,817
- What about Jong Kook? - She really likes...

1410
00:47:30,818 --> 00:47:32,917
- She likes him. - Jong Kook.

1411
00:47:32,918 --> 00:47:34,058
What about Kwang Soo?

1412
00:47:34,059 --> 00:47:35,328
(So Min's mother's favorite is Jong Kook.)

1413
00:47:35,329 --> 00:47:36,357
- She likes him. - What about Kwang Soo?

1414
00:47:36,358 --> 00:47:38,328
Wook Min really likes him.

1415
00:47:38,329 --> 00:47:40,658
- Her little brother. - I think men...

1416
00:47:40,659 --> 00:47:43,667
- like him in particular. - I know why Wook Min likes him.

1417
00:47:43,668 --> 00:47:46,098
- Why? - It's nice to know a naive guy.

1418
00:47:46,099 --> 00:47:48,493
(It's nice to know a naive guy.)

1419
00:47:48,568 --> 00:47:49,808
It is.

1420
00:47:49,809 --> 00:47:50,908
I'm not naive!

1421
00:47:50,909 --> 00:47:53,308
Wook Min would feel pressured around me.

1422
00:47:53,309 --> 00:47:54,738
Yes, he's a bit difficult.

1423
00:47:54,739 --> 00:47:57,809
He could even talk him into buying him a new gym.

1424
00:47:57,878 --> 00:47:59,118
(They move on to the new mission with the naive Kwang Soo.)

1425
00:47:59,119 --> 00:48:01,603
It's nice to know a guy like him.

1426
00:48:01,719 --> 00:48:03,031
A pushover.

1427
00:48:03,688 --> 00:48:05,357
(The next mission and lunch await them at the restaurant.)

1428
00:48:05,358 --> 00:48:08,627
We will have lunch at an all-you-can-eat barbecue place.

1429
00:48:08,628 --> 00:48:11,658
Wow, I used to love pork ribs when I was young.

1430
00:48:11,659 --> 00:48:13,298
It smells so good.

1431
00:48:13,299 --> 00:48:15,058
(All-you-can-eat pork ribs with its amazing partner naengmyeon.)

1432
00:48:15,059 --> 00:48:16,928
- Isn't this crazy? - Naengmyeon with grilled meat.

1433
00:48:16,929 --> 00:48:18,738
This is amazing!

1434
00:48:18,739 --> 00:48:20,516
Don't cut the noodles.

1435
00:48:20,568 --> 00:48:21,667
- Is it pork ribs? - Yes.

1436
00:48:21,668 --> 00:48:23,638
(Yummy)

1437
00:48:23,639 --> 00:48:25,738
(At the same time...)

1438
00:48:25,739 --> 00:48:26,877
(The three teams have to watch them eat.)

1439
00:48:26,878 --> 00:48:28,454
This is driving me crazy.

1440
00:48:29,349 --> 00:48:30,448
The next mission...

1441
00:48:30,449 --> 00:48:33,178
is called "Telepathic Four-Letter Words".

1442
00:48:33,179 --> 00:48:34,218
"Four-Letter Words"?

1443
00:48:34,219 --> 00:48:36,218
- Say... - Hello.

1444
00:48:36,219 --> 00:48:37,787
(They will take turns to say a 4-letter word with the initials.)

1445
00:48:37,788 --> 00:48:39,857
Crazy!

1446
00:48:39,858 --> 00:48:41,201
(They have great chemistry.)

1447
00:48:41,518 --> 00:48:43,851
- Pacific ocean... - It is.

1448
00:48:44,829 --> 00:48:46,445
- Kitchen... - Towel.

1449
00:48:46,929 --> 00:48:48,227
- Butterfly... - Effect.

1450
00:48:48,228 --> 00:48:49,298
(Correct)

1451
00:48:49,299 --> 00:48:51,116
- Battle of... - Yeonpyeong.

1452
00:48:51,938 --> 00:48:53,468
She knows that?

1453
00:48:53,469 --> 00:48:55,767
Jong Kook, Haha, and Se Chan's teams...

1454
00:48:55,768 --> 00:48:58,037
can begin eating all they want.

1455
00:48:58,038 --> 00:48:59,078
Okay!

1456
00:48:59,079 --> 00:49:00,508
(That is how they were able to have a great meal.)

1457
00:49:00,509 --> 00:49:02,498
I'm so happy!

1458
00:49:03,079 --> 00:49:05,301
The smell is driving me crazy.

1459
00:49:05,949 --> 00:49:09,448
Pork ribs taste best on top of rice.

1460
00:49:09,449 --> 00:49:11,218
Dipped in doenjang jjigae.

1461
00:49:11,219 --> 00:49:12,718
That's good.

1462
00:49:12,719 --> 00:49:14,435
(A piece of grilled meat with seasoned green onions)

1463
00:49:14,619 --> 00:49:17,416
- Ji Hyo, did you know that... - Hey!

1464
00:49:18,958 --> 00:49:20,428
(Hey! Stop that!)

1465
00:49:20,429 --> 00:49:21,658
I was flipping it for you.

1466
00:49:21,659 --> 00:49:23,828
I was flipping it so you could enjoy it.

1467
00:49:23,829 --> 00:49:25,738
- I'm going to flip you over. - I wouldn't eat...

1468
00:49:25,739 --> 00:49:27,997
(I'm going to flip you over.)

1469
00:49:27,998 --> 00:49:29,167
(Startled)

1470
00:49:29,168 --> 00:49:30,537
- You're being so mean. - Don't even think about it.

1471
00:49:30,538 --> 00:49:32,638
- Leave it. - You're being so mean.

1472
00:49:32,639 --> 00:49:34,037
I was always like this.

1473
00:49:34,038 --> 00:49:38,493
Now, a plate full of meat...

1474
00:49:38,549 --> 00:49:39,718
and this.

1475
00:49:39,719 --> 00:49:41,578
Do what you wanted to do.

1476
00:49:41,579 --> 00:49:42,787
(A plate of pork ribs and naengmyeon)

1477
00:49:42,788 --> 00:49:45,414
Get kicked by Jin Hee, and you can take this.

1478
00:49:46,119 --> 00:49:47,758
- Okay. - "Get kicked"?

1479
00:49:47,759 --> 00:49:49,087
I'll get kicked.

1480
00:49:49,088 --> 00:49:50,573
Go ahead, Jin Hee.

1481
00:49:50,688 --> 00:49:52,798
But you're on the same team.

1482
00:49:52,799 --> 00:49:54,142
She'll go easy on you.

1483
00:49:54,228 --> 00:49:57,267
I've been kicked by Bo Mi and many others,

1484
00:49:57,268 --> 00:49:59,437
but she's worse than you can ever imagine.

1485
00:49:59,438 --> 00:50:01,598
(She's worse than you can ever imagine.)

1486
00:50:01,599 --> 00:50:02,808
Fine, Jin Hee.

1487
00:50:02,809 --> 00:50:04,337
- It's going to hurt. - He's really going to get kicked.

1488
00:50:04,338 --> 00:50:05,578
- I'm ready to kick. - Okay, kick.

1489
00:50:05,579 --> 00:50:06,852
I'll kick.

1490
00:50:07,509 --> 00:50:09,008
He's trembling.

1491
00:50:09,009 --> 00:50:10,292
(How hard will Jin Hee's kick be?)

1492
00:50:10,509 --> 00:50:11,720
He's trembling.

1493
00:50:11,779 --> 00:50:13,698
(Smack)

1494
00:50:15,648 --> 00:50:16,718
Gosh...

1495
00:50:16,719 --> 00:50:18,417
(Smack)

1496
00:50:18,418 --> 00:50:19,888
- Gosh... - I was so surprised!

1497
00:50:19,889 --> 00:50:21,534
I think she kicked his bone.

1498
00:50:21,688 --> 00:50:23,227
Help me.

1499
00:50:23,228 --> 00:50:24,258
Jae Seok.

1500
00:50:24,259 --> 00:50:25,328
(This looks like...)

1501
00:50:25,329 --> 00:50:27,598
- Gosh, gosh. - "Gosh".

1502
00:50:27,599 --> 00:50:29,298
(His thoughts on Jin Hee's kick, "Gosh".)

1503
00:50:29,299 --> 00:50:31,767
- Gosh. - I approve. I really do.

1504
00:50:31,768 --> 00:50:33,098
Gosh...

1505
00:50:33,099 --> 00:50:34,837
- "Gosh"? - I approve.

1506
00:50:34,838 --> 00:50:37,067
(They leave behind the memory and arrive at the third mission.)

1507
00:50:37,068 --> 00:50:38,437
Why is it so grand?

1508
00:50:38,438 --> 00:50:40,037
- What is this? - What is this?

1509
00:50:40,038 --> 00:50:41,138
(The place is filled with second-hand cars.)

1510
00:50:41,139 --> 00:50:42,247
What is this?

1511
00:50:42,248 --> 00:50:46,389
(What kind of mission will they have to accomplish?)

1512
00:50:46,779 --> 00:50:49,548
We will begin the actual game, which is a battle.

1513
00:50:49,549 --> 00:50:51,917
You will take turns for each round.

1514
00:50:51,918 --> 00:50:53,878
The mission is called "Fly on Our Car".

1515
00:50:54,489 --> 00:50:56,888
The offense team will sit in front with their eyes covered,

1516
00:50:56,889 --> 00:50:58,328
and hit the other team...

1517
00:50:58,329 --> 00:50:59,758
with a fly swatter while they get through.

1518
00:50:59,759 --> 00:51:01,598
The defense team has to dodge the fly swatters...

1519
00:51:01,599 --> 00:51:04,198
and get through the back seat within 60 seconds.

1520
00:51:04,199 --> 00:51:05,837
Once you take a turn swatting,

1521
00:51:05,838 --> 00:51:07,897
you can take another turn after singing...

1522
00:51:07,898 --> 00:51:09,508
"says peekaboo to me".

1523
00:51:09,509 --> 00:51:11,337
- Says peekaboo to me - Says peekaboo to me

1524
00:51:11,338 --> 00:51:12,837
Then we will proceed.

1525
00:51:12,838 --> 00:51:14,090
(Since they know the rules, the games will begin!)

1526
00:51:14,538 --> 00:51:16,607
- Are you ready? - Yes!

1527
00:51:16,608 --> 00:51:17,820
Go!

1528
00:51:18,049 --> 00:51:19,747
I'll make sure you don't get through.

1529
00:51:19,748 --> 00:51:22,374
We have to sing it after one swat, right?

1530
00:51:22,389 --> 00:51:23,732
We can't do it at the same time.

1531
00:51:23,748 --> 00:51:25,517
- We will begin! - One minute is plenty of time.

1532
00:51:25,518 --> 00:51:26,758
(They have to go through without getting swatted.)

1533
00:51:26,759 --> 00:51:28,102
Slowly. Take your time.

1534
00:51:28,159 --> 00:51:29,587
Let's go!

1535
00:51:29,588 --> 00:51:30,687
- We will begin! - Let's go!

1536
00:51:30,688 --> 00:51:32,828
One minute! Ready, get set...

1537
00:51:32,829 --> 00:51:34,328
(Time limit of 60 seconds...)

1538
00:51:34,329 --> 00:51:36,127
(Start!)

1539
00:51:36,128 --> 00:51:39,098
- Says peekaboo to me - Says peekaboo to me

1540
00:51:39,299 --> 00:51:42,138
- Says peekaboo to me - Says peekaboo to me

1541
00:51:42,139 --> 00:51:44,008
- He's so fast. - Says peekaboo to me

1542
00:51:44,009 --> 00:51:45,408
- Says peekaboo to me - Says peekaboo...

1543
00:51:45,409 --> 00:51:47,477
- Says peekaboo to me - We have to get through that?

1544
00:51:47,478 --> 00:51:49,498
- Says peekaboo to me - What is that?

1545
00:51:50,049 --> 00:51:51,747
(It won't be easy...)

1546
00:51:51,748 --> 00:51:53,637
- You have to do the gestures. - I'm scared.

1547
00:51:54,679 --> 00:51:56,388
Says peekaboo to me

1548
00:51:56,389 --> 00:51:58,517
(Rothy, who was looking for the right time, goes for it!)

1549
00:51:58,518 --> 00:52:01,791
(She has to dodge the fly swatter and gets through the back seat.)

1550
00:52:02,059 --> 00:52:04,388
(Will she be able to succeed?)

1551
00:52:04,389 --> 00:52:06,397
(Swat)

1552
00:52:06,398 --> 00:52:07,528
My goodness.

1553
00:52:07,529 --> 00:52:09,386
Says peekaboo to me

1554
00:52:09,829 --> 00:52:12,868
(A fly swatter slap)

1555
00:52:12,869 --> 00:52:14,368
(No...)

1556
00:52:14,369 --> 00:52:17,167
(This soon?)

1557
00:52:17,168 --> 00:52:18,937
- Says peekaboo to me - Did she get hit?

1558
00:52:18,938 --> 00:52:20,638
- Is it over? - Says peekaboo to me

1559
00:52:20,639 --> 00:52:21,707
Fail.

1560
00:52:21,708 --> 00:52:23,647
(Rothy fails at her first try at variety shows.)

1561
00:52:23,648 --> 00:52:25,295
Says peekaboo to me

1562
00:52:25,449 --> 00:52:27,417
(They're fully ready to attack Kwang Soo.)

1563
00:52:27,418 --> 00:52:29,488
(Stretch)

1564
00:52:29,489 --> 00:52:30,988
You have to together.

1565
00:52:30,989 --> 00:52:32,957
(He jumps!)

1566
00:52:32,958 --> 00:52:35,787
(He goes for the short gap in between swings and jumps.)

1567
00:52:35,788 --> 00:52:38,028
(Long)

1568
00:52:38,029 --> 00:52:39,098
Says peekaboo to me

1569
00:52:39,099 --> 00:52:42,627
(He passed easily.)

1570
00:52:42,628 --> 00:52:43,667
(Look at his length!)

1571
00:52:43,668 --> 00:52:44,982
Says peekaboo to me

1572
00:52:45,469 --> 00:52:47,098
(It is the end of Seok Jin and So Min's offense.)

1573
00:52:47,099 --> 00:52:48,098
Did they succeed?

1574
00:52:48,099 --> 00:52:49,468
- Kwang Soo succeeded alone. - Okay!

1575
00:52:49,469 --> 00:52:51,489
What? Seriously?

1576
00:52:51,608 --> 00:52:53,037
I hit someone, didn't I?

1577
00:52:53,038 --> 00:52:55,238
So Min slapped Rothy with the fly swatter.

1578
00:52:55,239 --> 00:52:56,678
Did I?

1579
00:52:56,679 --> 00:52:57,991
(Was that her cheek? I'm sorry.)

1580
00:52:58,449 --> 00:52:59,647
Is this how you do it?

1581
00:52:59,648 --> 00:53:01,877
Only one of them succeeded, so do we win if we both succeed?

1582
00:53:01,878 --> 00:53:03,838
(The offense and defense change places.)

1583
00:53:04,518 --> 00:53:05,618
Let's both get through.

1584
00:53:05,619 --> 00:53:06,988
Where do we have to go through?

1585
00:53:06,989 --> 00:53:08,634
- Gosh! - That's going to hurt!

1586
00:53:09,628 --> 00:53:10,971
What is that?

1587
00:53:11,559 --> 00:53:13,357
- Gosh! - That's going to hurt!

1588
00:53:13,358 --> 00:53:15,227
(The tallest member Kwang Soo's terrifying attacking range.)

1589
00:53:15,228 --> 00:53:16,411
Ready...

1590
00:53:17,128 --> 00:53:18,167
(The game starts.)

1591
00:53:18,168 --> 00:53:19,638
Says peekaboo to me

1592
00:53:19,639 --> 00:53:20,698
- Do the gestures too. - Says peekaboo to me

1593
00:53:20,699 --> 00:53:22,207
Says peekaboo to me

1594
00:53:22,208 --> 00:53:24,633
- Says peekaboo to me - Says peekaboo to me

1595
00:53:25,038 --> 00:53:27,937
(Seok Jin goes in during the short gap.)

1596
00:53:27,938 --> 00:53:29,292
- Says peekaboo to me - Says peekaboo to me

1597
00:53:29,978 --> 00:53:33,618
(He is swift despite his model year.)

1598
00:53:33,619 --> 00:53:36,017
(Will he be able to get through?)

1599
00:53:36,018 --> 00:53:38,038
(My gosh...)

1600
00:53:40,458 --> 00:53:42,488
(Swat)

1601
00:53:42,489 --> 00:53:44,658
- Says peekaboo to me - Says peekaboo to me

1602
00:53:44,659 --> 00:53:48,028
(He couldn't dodge Kwang Soo's super reach and got a fatal blow.)

1603
00:53:48,029 --> 00:53:50,198
(Oh, my goodness.)

1604
00:53:50,199 --> 00:53:51,897
(He tries to get out, but...)

1605
00:53:51,898 --> 00:53:54,098
(Swat)

1606
00:53:54,099 --> 00:53:55,397
(Swat)

1607
00:53:55,398 --> 00:53:57,707
(It is full of fly swatters.)

1608
00:53:57,708 --> 00:53:59,578
- Says peekaboo to me - Says peekaboo to me

1609
00:53:59,579 --> 00:54:02,377
- Says peekaboo to me - Says peekaboo to me

1610
00:54:02,378 --> 00:54:04,025
(It is So Min's turn.)

1611
00:54:05,409 --> 00:54:08,778
(She leaps up as soon as it begins!)

1612
00:54:08,779 --> 00:54:10,001
- Says peekaboo to me - Says peekaboo to me

1613
00:54:11,049 --> 00:54:13,078
(She dodged it!)

1614
00:54:13,818 --> 00:54:15,950
(Swat)

1615
00:54:16,228 --> 00:54:18,028
- She got hit. - Says peekaboo to me

1616
00:54:18,029 --> 00:54:20,987
(So Min is out.)

1617
00:54:21,659 --> 00:54:23,198
(Seok Jin and So Min failed to get through.)

1618
00:54:23,199 --> 00:54:24,828
Both failed. Kwang Soo's team won!

1619
00:54:24,829 --> 00:54:26,437
Okay!

1620
00:54:26,438 --> 00:54:27,468
(Kwang Soo and Rothy win.)

1621
00:54:27,469 --> 00:54:28,968
Kwang Soo hits so hard.

1622
00:54:28,969 --> 00:54:30,167
Seriously...

1623
00:54:30,168 --> 00:54:32,377
Were you trying to kill a fly or a human?

1624
00:54:32,378 --> 00:54:33,638
It's because I couldn't see.

1625
00:54:33,639 --> 00:54:34,951
- I couldn't see. - Next up,

1626
00:54:34,978 --> 00:54:36,278
- Jong Kook... - Yes!

1627
00:54:36,279 --> 00:54:37,607
and Ji Hyo.

1628
00:54:37,608 --> 00:54:39,048
- Yes. - And...

1629
00:54:39,049 --> 00:54:41,178
(Jong Kook and Ji Hyo versus Haha and Ji In)

1630
00:54:41,179 --> 00:54:43,068
This game is hard.

1631
00:54:44,418 --> 00:54:45,718
I really want to do well.

1632
00:54:45,719 --> 00:54:47,317
- Do I go like this? - I want to be a hero.

1633
00:54:47,318 --> 00:54:48,687
(Swish)

1634
00:54:48,688 --> 00:54:50,558
- This is going to hurt. - This is going to hurt so bad.

1635
00:54:50,559 --> 00:54:52,528
- He could slit open the flesh. - Says peekaboo to me

1636
00:54:52,529 --> 00:54:53,598
(You're going to go that far?)

1637
00:54:53,599 --> 00:54:55,298
- Says peekaboo to me - Says peekaboo to me

1638
00:54:55,299 --> 00:54:56,868
- He's fast! - Says peekaboo to me

1639
00:54:56,869 --> 00:54:58,828
- Says peekaboo to me - He's too fast.

1640
00:54:58,829 --> 00:55:00,067
- Says peekaboo to me - Says peekaboo to me

1641
00:55:00,068 --> 00:55:01,837
- The seats are about to burst open! - Says peekaboo to me

1642
00:55:01,838 --> 00:55:03,107
- Gosh! - Says peekaboo to me

1643
00:55:03,108 --> 00:55:04,207
Have we started?

1644
00:55:04,208 --> 00:55:05,955
How are they supposed to get through that?

1645
00:55:06,179 --> 00:55:07,552
Ready...

1646
00:55:09,248 --> 00:55:11,329
Says peekaboo to me

1647
00:55:11,779 --> 00:55:14,444
- Says peekaboo to me - Says peekaboo to me

1648
00:55:14,818 --> 00:55:16,187
- Says peekaboo to me - Says peekaboo to me

1649
00:55:16,188 --> 00:55:17,687
Why did he push the car?

1650
00:55:17,688 --> 00:55:20,142
To pretend that he got on.

1651
00:55:20,219 --> 00:55:22,087
- Says peekaboo to me - Says peekaboo to me

1652
00:55:22,088 --> 00:55:24,227
- Says peekaboo to me - Says peekaboo to me

1653
00:55:24,228 --> 00:55:25,388
(The terrifying speed)

1654
00:55:25,389 --> 00:55:26,828
Says peekaboo to me

1655
00:55:26,829 --> 00:55:28,198
Says peekaboo to me

1656
00:55:28,199 --> 00:55:29,428
Says peekaboo to me

1657
00:55:29,429 --> 00:55:30,868
- It's too fast! - Says peekaboo to me

1658
00:55:30,869 --> 00:55:32,368
It's so scary!

1659
00:55:32,369 --> 00:55:33,968
- Says peekaboo to me - Says peekaboo to me

1660
00:55:33,969 --> 00:55:36,667
- Says peekaboo to me - Says peekaboo to me

1661
00:55:36,668 --> 00:55:37,951
(Even though the swatting was fast, he jumps.)

1662
00:55:38,538 --> 00:55:40,537
- Says peekaboo to me - Says peekaboo to me

1663
00:55:40,538 --> 00:55:42,468
(He flies up with all his might...)

1664
00:55:43,409 --> 00:55:45,499
(and dodged it.)

1665
00:55:47,179 --> 00:55:49,340
(And dodged it again.)

1666
00:55:49,349 --> 00:55:50,948
- Says peekaboo to me - Says peekaboo to me

1667
00:55:50,949 --> 00:55:53,584
(He passed through.)

1668
00:55:54,159 --> 00:55:56,627
(Haha succeeded.)

1669
00:55:56,628 --> 00:55:57,758
He didn't get hit?

1670
00:55:57,759 --> 00:55:58,928
(He dodged the fly swatter like Neo dodging bullets.)

1671
00:55:58,929 --> 00:56:00,313
He didn't get hit.

1672
00:56:00,858 --> 00:56:03,222
- Says peekaboo to me - Says peekaboo to me

1673
00:56:03,268 --> 00:56:04,868
- You have 15 seconds left. - I hit someone.

1674
00:56:04,869 --> 00:56:06,397
- Says peekaboo to me - Says peekaboo to me

1675
00:56:06,398 --> 00:56:07,968
- Says peekaboo to me - Says peekaboo to me

1676
00:56:07,969 --> 00:56:09,037
Says peekaboo to me

1677
00:56:09,038 --> 00:56:10,808
(Jump, swat)

1678
00:56:10,809 --> 00:56:13,377
(Ji In failed.)

1679
00:56:13,378 --> 00:56:14,977
- She got hit. - Ji Hyo got her.

1680
00:56:14,978 --> 00:56:16,808
- That's a shame. - Haha got through.

1681
00:56:16,809 --> 00:56:17,848
Really?

1682
00:56:17,849 --> 00:56:19,839
It was like a scene from a movie.

1683
00:56:20,119 --> 00:56:21,548
It was "Mission: Impossible".

1684
00:56:21,549 --> 00:56:23,017
Says peekaboo to me right?

1685
00:56:23,018 --> 00:56:24,388
Says peekaboo to me.

1686
00:56:24,389 --> 00:56:26,479
While I'm blocking...

1687
00:56:26,818 --> 00:56:28,102
Do we have to go one by one?

1688
00:56:28,559 --> 00:56:31,328
It doesn't matter. You can do whatever within 60 seconds.

1689
00:56:31,329 --> 00:56:32,328
But...

1690
00:56:32,329 --> 00:56:34,247
Jong Kook says scary things sometimes.

1691
00:56:34,659 --> 00:56:36,447
His way of thinking is unique.

1692
00:56:36,869 --> 00:56:38,990
Is he going to throw Ji Hyo?

1693
00:56:39,599 --> 00:56:40,837
Those guys...

1694
00:56:40,838 --> 00:56:41,980
Ready.

1695
00:56:42,639 --> 00:56:43,851
And...

1696
00:56:44,338 --> 00:56:46,258
(The game starts.)

1697
00:56:46,409 --> 00:56:47,408
Says peekaboo to me...

1698
00:56:47,409 --> 00:56:49,266
(Ji Hyo is waiting for the right moment.)

1699
00:56:50,049 --> 00:56:51,377
- Says peekaboo to me - Says peekaboo to me

1700
00:56:51,378 --> 00:56:54,247
(Fast)

1701
00:56:54,248 --> 00:56:56,848
(Both the timing and speed were fabulous.)

1702
00:56:56,849 --> 00:56:59,283
(This is who Ji Hyo is.)

1703
00:56:59,559 --> 00:57:02,214
- 20 seconds has passed. - Says peekaboo to me

1704
00:57:02,259 --> 00:57:03,904
I'll wait.

1705
00:57:04,829 --> 00:57:06,546
(The car moves.)

1706
00:57:07,128 --> 00:57:11,127
(Right after their attack, )

1707
00:57:11,128 --> 00:57:13,567
(Jong Kook jumps up.)

1708
00:57:13,568 --> 00:57:16,164
(Will Jong Kook's jump pay off?)

1709
00:57:16,639 --> 00:57:19,770
(Jong Kook passes through.)

1710
00:57:20,639 --> 00:57:22,396
What happened? Did something happen?

1711
00:57:22,648 --> 00:57:23,647
Says peekaboo to me...

1712
00:57:23,648 --> 00:57:26,073
(He passes very quickly.)

1713
00:57:26,478 --> 00:57:28,398
(By jumping, )

1714
00:57:28,818 --> 00:57:30,868
(he escapes right away.)

1715
00:57:31,889 --> 00:57:33,857
(Shocked)

1716
00:57:33,858 --> 00:57:35,030
Both of them succeeded.

1717
00:57:35,358 --> 00:57:36,500
Incredible.

1718
00:57:37,059 --> 00:57:38,357
Jong Kook and Ji Hyo win.

1719
00:57:38,358 --> 00:57:39,428
(Jong Kook and Ji Hyo win.)

1720
00:57:39,429 --> 00:57:41,258
What's with these two?

1721
00:57:41,259 --> 00:57:42,598
It's impossible.

1722
00:57:42,599 --> 00:57:44,368
- What's with them? - Let's not compete against them.

1723
00:57:44,369 --> 00:57:45,497
- It's our turn. - It's our turn.

1724
00:57:45,498 --> 00:57:47,598
Do you want to attack or defend?

1725
00:57:47,599 --> 00:57:48,598
- We'll attack. - Okay.

1726
00:57:48,599 --> 00:57:49,951
- Should we try to pass first? - Yes.

1727
00:57:50,139 --> 00:57:52,267
She has long arms.

1728
00:57:52,268 --> 00:57:53,490
Ready.

1729
00:57:54,938 --> 00:57:56,207
- Says peekaboo to me - Says peekaboo to me

1730
00:57:56,208 --> 00:57:59,783
(Jae Seok and Jin Hee take turns.)

1731
00:58:00,918 --> 00:58:01,948
Says peekaboo to me

1732
00:58:01,949 --> 00:58:03,048
(Dodging)

1733
00:58:03,049 --> 00:58:04,604
(Dodging again)

1734
00:58:04,648 --> 00:58:06,658
(Like a flying squirrel, )

1735
00:58:06,659 --> 00:58:08,388
(she escaped so easily.)

1736
00:58:08,389 --> 00:58:09,457
(Amazed)

1737
00:58:09,458 --> 00:58:10,587
Oh, my.

1738
00:58:10,588 --> 00:58:12,658
(Seung Hee is a versatile flying squirrel.)

1739
00:58:12,659 --> 00:58:14,857
(It's Se Chan's turn.)

1740
00:58:14,858 --> 00:58:17,167
- Says peekaboo to me - Says peekaboo to me

1741
00:58:17,168 --> 00:58:18,167
(Hesitating)

1742
00:58:18,168 --> 00:58:19,767
(Hit)

1743
00:58:19,768 --> 00:58:21,182
(Screaming)

1744
00:58:22,068 --> 00:58:23,408
(Perfect strike)

1745
00:58:23,409 --> 00:58:24,937
- What happened? - Hey.

1746
00:58:24,938 --> 00:58:26,424
- What's wrong? - The timing...

1747
00:58:26,438 --> 00:58:28,802
(My goodness.)

1748
00:58:28,938 --> 00:58:31,503
What happened? What's wrong?

1749
00:58:32,009 --> 00:58:33,578
- I mean... - Gosh.

1750
00:58:33,579 --> 00:58:36,417
I looked, and Jin Hee wasn't doing anything.

1751
00:58:36,418 --> 00:58:37,862
Only Seung Hee passed.

1752
00:58:38,018 --> 00:58:40,118
- Did Seung Hee pass? - She passed right away.

1753
00:58:40,119 --> 00:58:41,917
- Okay. - Good job.

1754
00:58:41,918 --> 00:58:43,302
She was like a flying squirrel.

1755
00:58:43,958 --> 00:58:45,878
I caught a huge fly.

1756
00:58:46,858 --> 00:58:49,868
(It's Se Chan and Seung Hee's turn to attack.)

1757
00:58:49,869 --> 00:58:51,950
(Says peekaboo to me)

1758
00:58:53,469 --> 00:58:55,155
(He waits for a moment before attacking.)

1759
00:58:55,239 --> 00:58:56,837
We haven't started yet, Se Chan.

1760
00:58:56,838 --> 00:58:58,107
(The producer holds back his laughter.)

1761
00:58:58,108 --> 00:58:59,738
He's weird.

1762
00:58:59,739 --> 00:59:01,657
Ready, and...

1763
00:59:03,049 --> 00:59:05,433
(The game starts.)

1764
00:59:05,809 --> 00:59:07,448
Says peekaboo to me

1765
00:59:07,449 --> 00:59:10,647
(As they're the youngest, they're especially fast.)

1766
00:59:10,648 --> 00:59:13,357
(Slow)

1767
00:59:13,358 --> 00:59:14,457
Says peekaboo to me

1768
00:59:14,458 --> 00:59:16,227
(What is he doing?)

1769
00:59:16,228 --> 00:59:18,127
- Says peekaboo to me - Says peekaboo to me

1770
00:59:18,128 --> 00:59:21,058
- Says peekaboo to me - Says peekaboo to me

1771
00:59:21,059 --> 00:59:22,158
Says peekaboo to me

1772
00:59:22,159 --> 00:59:25,868
(Se Chan's strategy is to wait for a moment before attacking.)

1773
00:59:25,869 --> 00:59:28,537
(Meanwhile, the sloth stands on his both feet.)

1774
00:59:28,538 --> 00:59:31,467
(What is he going to do?)

1775
00:59:32,108 --> 00:59:35,107
(He is standing right in the middle.)

1776
00:59:35,108 --> 00:59:36,578
Says peekaboo to me

1777
00:59:36,579 --> 00:59:39,247
(Here, neither fly swatter reaches Jae Seok.)

1778
00:59:39,248 --> 00:59:40,663
(He sure is smart.)

1779
00:59:41,248 --> 00:59:43,067
(What the heck is going on?)

1780
00:59:43,619 --> 00:59:45,747
(Jae Seok waits for the right moment.)

1781
00:59:45,748 --> 00:59:46,817
Says peekaboo to me

1782
00:59:46,818 --> 00:59:50,457
(Jumping)

1783
00:59:50,458 --> 00:59:51,658
(Jae Seok passes by waiting in the middle.)

1784
00:59:51,659 --> 00:59:52,658
- He passed. - Next.

1785
00:59:52,659 --> 00:59:53,658
(Jae Seok passes by waiting in the middle.)

1786
00:59:53,659 --> 00:59:55,158
Says peekaboo to me

1787
00:59:55,159 --> 00:59:57,289
- Now, 10 seconds left. - Says peekaboo to me

1788
00:59:57,668 --> 01:00:00,937
(If she passes within 10 seconds, Jae Seok and Jin Hee win.)

1789
01:00:00,938 --> 01:00:03,667
- Says peekaboo to me - In 6, 5, 4...

1790
01:00:03,668 --> 01:00:05,961
(To tell you about Jin Hee...)

1791
01:00:06,338 --> 01:00:09,647
(She even defeated the ace easily.)

1792
01:00:09,648 --> 01:00:12,107
(She also made a man kneel down.)

1793
01:00:12,108 --> 01:00:14,502
(There has been no stronger guest than she is.)

1794
01:00:14,549 --> 01:00:17,719
(Will she prove her ability again?)

1795
01:00:17,748 --> 01:00:18,747
- Four... - Says peekaboo to me

1796
01:00:18,748 --> 01:00:19,957
(Hit)

1797
01:00:19,958 --> 01:00:21,687
(Hit again)

1798
01:00:21,688 --> 01:00:23,476
Gosh. What happened?

1799
01:00:23,829 --> 01:00:24,940
(Screaming)

1800
01:00:25,029 --> 01:00:26,028
What happened?

1801
01:00:26,029 --> 01:00:29,428
(She is knocked out by two consecutive hits.)

1802
01:00:29,429 --> 01:00:31,267
I took too long, Jin Hee.

1803
01:00:31,268 --> 01:00:32,497
- I'm sorry. - It's okay.

1804
01:00:32,498 --> 01:00:33,968
I thought you weren't doing anything.

1805
01:00:33,969 --> 01:00:34,968
I was hit on the leg.

1806
01:00:34,969 --> 01:00:37,037
One member of each team passed,

1807
01:00:37,038 --> 01:00:39,377
but Seung Hee was a lot faster, taking only 10 seconds.

1808
01:00:39,378 --> 01:00:40,408
(Se Chan and Seung Hee win.)

1809
01:00:40,409 --> 01:00:42,537
The winning teams are, Jong Kook and Ji Hyo, Kwang Soo and Rothy,

1810
01:00:42,538 --> 01:00:44,147
and Se Chan and Seung Hee.

1811
01:00:44,148 --> 01:00:46,278
(Jong Kook and Ji Hyo, Kwang Soo and Rothy, and Se Chan and Seung Hee)

1812
01:00:46,279 --> 01:00:47,647
We lost again.

1813
01:00:47,648 --> 01:00:49,348
The winning teams will receive cards.

1814
01:00:49,349 --> 01:00:50,348
- The winning teams... - Okay!

1815
01:00:50,349 --> 01:00:51,460
Three.

1816
01:00:51,949 --> 01:00:53,417
- What? - It's all O cards.

1817
01:00:53,418 --> 01:00:54,658
- Three O cards. - Did I do a good job?

1818
01:00:54,659 --> 01:00:55,857
You did a great job.

1819
01:00:55,858 --> 01:00:57,677
- Three. - Here we go.

1820
01:00:57,829 --> 01:00:59,677
(Only Seok Jin and So Min picked O card.)

1821
01:00:59,958 --> 01:01:01,069
Did we pick it?

1822
01:01:01,599 --> 01:01:04,067
Kwang Soo and Rothy are in the lead now.

1823
01:01:04,068 --> 01:01:05,198
(Kwang Soo and Rothy are in the lead.)

1824
01:01:05,199 --> 01:01:06,397
Congratulations.

1825
01:01:06,398 --> 01:01:07,883
(Kwang Soo and Rothy are in the lead.)

1826
01:01:08,699 --> 01:01:10,167
(They arrive at a pool in Suwon for the last mission.)

1827
01:01:10,168 --> 01:01:11,738
- Oh, my. - Oh, no.

1828
01:01:11,739 --> 01:01:14,233
We're in trouble. They're flying chairs.

1829
01:01:14,378 --> 01:01:15,578
It's this again.

1830
01:01:15,579 --> 01:01:18,548
We'll be flying off the chairs. Gosh.

1831
01:01:18,549 --> 01:01:20,147
This is not okay.

1832
01:01:20,148 --> 01:01:21,917
Even the weather is perfect for flying though.

1833
01:01:21,918 --> 01:01:23,232
You're right, but still...

1834
01:01:24,188 --> 01:01:27,896
The last mission where you get to turn the tables is Flying Quiz.

1835
01:01:28,259 --> 01:01:29,457
(Flying Quiz)

1836
01:01:29,458 --> 01:01:30,857
- Okay. - It's a quiz.

1837
01:01:30,858 --> 01:01:33,198
We've never won except for the first round.

1838
01:01:33,199 --> 01:01:35,428
Let's win this time, Jin Hee.

1839
01:01:35,429 --> 01:01:39,298
For this mission, men, and women will play separate rounds.

1840
01:01:39,299 --> 01:01:42,267
The quiz is about situations that couples can face.

1841
01:01:42,268 --> 01:01:44,638
You're to give an answer appropriate for the situation.

1842
01:01:44,639 --> 01:01:48,477
If more than half of the judges show an O card,

1843
01:01:48,478 --> 01:01:49,548
it counts as a correct answer.

1844
01:01:49,549 --> 01:01:50,848
If more than half show an X card,

1845
01:01:50,849 --> 01:01:53,848
the answer is wrong, and the partner will be penalized.

1846
01:01:53,849 --> 01:01:55,578
After all rounds are finished,

1847
01:01:55,579 --> 01:01:58,048
the couples with more correct answers will win.

1848
01:01:58,049 --> 01:01:59,687
The top three teams will get a chance to win a prize badge,

1849
01:01:59,688 --> 01:02:02,058
and the bottom three teams a penalty badge.

1850
01:02:02,059 --> 01:02:03,587
The judges have to agree with our answers.

1851
01:02:03,588 --> 01:02:04,928
- That's right. - Okay.

1852
01:02:04,929 --> 01:02:06,198
Is there no one correct answer?

1853
01:02:06,199 --> 01:02:08,280
- You have to steal their hearts. - There's no right or wrong.

1854
01:02:08,559 --> 01:02:10,828
- This is hard. - Gosh.

1855
01:02:10,829 --> 01:02:12,397
The judges have to agree.

1856
01:02:12,398 --> 01:02:14,490
Ji Hyo doesn't use a messenger.

1857
01:02:15,438 --> 01:02:18,267
(Ji Hyo doesn't use a messenger and is bad at couple situations.)

1858
01:02:18,869 --> 01:02:21,238
I bet Seok Jin will be the worst at this game.

1859
01:02:21,239 --> 01:02:23,178
You have to make the judges sympathize with you.

1860
01:02:23,179 --> 01:02:25,329
I understand women well.

1861
01:02:26,418 --> 01:02:28,317
- You understand women well? - Of course.

1862
01:02:28,318 --> 01:02:30,267
But your wife is always unhappy.

1863
01:02:31,049 --> 01:02:33,317
Male members will play first.

1864
01:02:33,318 --> 01:02:35,417
- Let the female judges enter. - Okay.

1865
01:02:35,418 --> 01:02:36,601
(The final mission starts.)

1866
01:02:36,958 --> 01:02:38,878
Female judges, please come in.

1867
01:02:39,728 --> 01:02:41,727
- Who are they? - Hyung Seon?

1868
01:02:41,728 --> 01:02:43,098
- What? - Hyung Seon?

1869
01:02:43,099 --> 01:02:44,198
Ha Neul?

1870
01:02:44,199 --> 01:02:45,397
- Wait. - Our staff members?

1871
01:02:45,398 --> 01:02:47,037
- Is that Hyung Seon? - Ha Neul too?

1872
01:02:47,038 --> 01:02:48,537
(Female staff members become the judges.)

1873
01:02:48,538 --> 01:02:49,908
Hyung Seon. Ha Neul.

1874
01:02:49,909 --> 01:02:53,170
As far as I know, Hyung Seon is not normal.

1875
01:02:53,679 --> 01:02:55,396
(I'm not normal?)

1876
01:02:55,538 --> 01:02:57,326
- When it comes to relationships... - Wait.

1877
01:02:57,378 --> 01:02:59,267
You look a bit like Guan Yu today.

1878
01:03:00,349 --> 01:03:02,218
(Like Guan Yu, she looks aggressive.)

1879
01:03:02,219 --> 01:03:04,247
You look like a really good fighter.

1880
01:03:04,248 --> 01:03:05,747
- Hyung Seon. - The guard has appeared before.

1881
01:03:05,748 --> 01:03:07,317
- That's right. - That's right.

1882
01:03:07,318 --> 01:03:09,017
- She's very strict. - She's appeared before.

1883
01:03:09,018 --> 01:03:10,258
Ha Neul...

1884
01:03:10,259 --> 01:03:12,158
I don't recognize the one at the end. Who are you?

1885
01:03:12,159 --> 01:03:13,857
- Who? - The one on the far right.

1886
01:03:13,858 --> 01:03:15,658
She's the one who puts microphones on you every week.

1887
01:03:15,659 --> 01:03:16,667
It's Hae In.

1888
01:03:16,668 --> 01:03:19,167
(She's the one who puts microphones on you every week.)

1889
01:03:19,168 --> 01:03:21,219
- It's Hae In. - It's been more than five years.

1890
01:03:21,239 --> 01:03:22,267
I wasn't serious.

1891
01:03:22,268 --> 01:03:23,368
- Please sit down. - Okay.

1892
01:03:23,369 --> 01:03:24,937
Hae In must feel so hurt.

1893
01:03:24,938 --> 01:03:27,238
- Please don't feel offended. - She must be dumbfounded.

1894
01:03:27,239 --> 01:03:29,437
I can read women's minds.

1895
01:03:29,438 --> 01:03:30,948
(What is he saying?)

1896
01:03:30,949 --> 01:03:32,848
Say "start" before you answer.

1897
01:03:32,849 --> 01:03:33,848
- Okay. - Start!

1898
01:03:33,849 --> 01:03:36,949
Here's the first couple's chat.

1899
01:03:38,018 --> 01:03:39,187
(Honey, drive safe. Tell me when you arrive.)

1900
01:03:39,188 --> 01:03:41,658
(I'm sorry. I tried to be careful, but I scratched your car.)

1901
01:03:41,659 --> 01:03:42,957
(I know how much you care about your car. I must have been crazy.)

1902
01:03:42,958 --> 01:03:45,287
"Honey, drive safe. Tell me when you arrive."

1903
01:03:45,288 --> 01:03:47,428
"I'm sorry. I tried to be careful, but I scratched your car."

1904
01:03:47,429 --> 01:03:50,267
"I know how much you care about your car. I must have been crazy."

1905
01:03:50,268 --> 01:03:51,428
"I'm so sorry."

1906
01:03:51,429 --> 01:03:52,741
Start!

1907
01:03:53,338 --> 01:03:54,337
Start!

1908
01:03:54,338 --> 01:03:55,798
- Isn't it too early? - No.

1909
01:03:55,799 --> 01:03:56,949
Okay.

1910
01:03:57,108 --> 01:04:00,168
Honey, don't worry about my car.

1911
01:04:00,478 --> 01:04:03,408
Scratching it once is not enough. Go scratch it a few more times.

1912
01:04:03,409 --> 01:04:04,408
It's okay.

1913
01:04:04,409 --> 01:04:07,417
(Scratching it once is not enough. Go scratch it a few more times.)

1914
01:04:07,418 --> 01:04:08,548
- That's so lovely. - That sounds...

1915
01:04:08,549 --> 01:04:11,287
- a bit sarcastic. - I'm trying to be humorous.

1916
01:04:11,288 --> 01:04:13,658
- I'm just being humorous. - In 1, 2, 3.

1917
01:04:13,659 --> 01:04:14,758
- That's sarcastic. - Oh, my.

1918
01:04:14,759 --> 01:04:17,158
(What do the female judges think of his humorous reply?)

1919
01:04:17,159 --> 01:04:19,512
(All X cards)

1920
01:04:20,759 --> 01:04:22,415
- It was the worst. - It was the worst.

1921
01:04:22,458 --> 01:04:23,968
- Oh, my. - Wasn't it nice?

1922
01:04:23,969 --> 01:04:26,167
- It was so sarcastic. - I'm making her feel better.

1923
01:04:26,168 --> 01:04:27,337
Here we go.

1924
01:04:27,338 --> 01:04:29,267
- Don't worry. - In 1, 2, 3.

1925
01:04:29,268 --> 01:04:30,408
Don't worry.

1926
01:04:30,409 --> 01:04:31,549
(Flying)

1927
01:04:33,038 --> 01:04:37,207
(She spreads her arms out like wings.)

1928
01:04:37,208 --> 01:04:40,647
(I'm flying today too.)

1929
01:04:40,648 --> 01:04:42,317
My goodness.

1930
01:04:42,318 --> 01:04:44,287
- I know. - Hae In, why...

1931
01:04:44,288 --> 01:04:45,647
Why did you show an X card?

1932
01:04:45,648 --> 01:04:47,857
It sounded like he was mocking me.

1933
01:04:47,858 --> 01:04:49,131
It hurt my feelings.

1934
01:04:49,418 --> 01:04:51,127
- It hurt her feelings. - Wait.

1935
01:04:51,128 --> 01:04:52,127
What about you?

1936
01:04:52,128 --> 01:04:54,522
He was telling me to have an accident.

1937
01:04:54,559 --> 01:04:56,012
That's not what I meant.

1938
01:04:56,228 --> 01:04:57,828
He asked for an accident.

1939
01:04:57,829 --> 01:04:59,198
- Okay. Start! - Start!

1940
01:04:59,199 --> 01:05:00,198
- Start! - Let me answer!

1941
01:05:00,199 --> 01:05:01,855
- Jae Seok. - Let me answer.

1942
01:05:02,538 --> 01:05:06,238
Please call me.

1943
01:05:06,239 --> 01:05:08,437
(Why does he want a call?)

1944
01:05:08,438 --> 01:05:10,327
- It's a messenger. - It's a messenger.

1945
01:05:10,549 --> 01:05:12,448
(Were we talking about a messenger?)

1946
01:05:12,449 --> 01:05:13,848
Use a messenger.

1947
01:05:13,849 --> 01:05:16,048
He doesn't use a messenger.

1948
01:05:16,049 --> 01:05:17,448
Use a messenger.

1949
01:05:17,449 --> 01:05:18,817
- I'm sorry. - He doesn't use a messenger.

1950
01:05:18,818 --> 01:05:21,849
You must have been surprised. Are you okay?

1951
01:05:21,918 --> 01:05:24,328
You must have been very surprised.

1952
01:05:24,329 --> 01:05:25,874
Try to calm down.

1953
01:05:25,958 --> 01:05:27,698
Don't worry too much about the scratches.

1954
01:05:27,699 --> 01:05:29,275
Maybe you should just call.

1955
01:05:29,358 --> 01:05:30,868
This is not...

1956
01:05:30,869 --> 01:05:33,567
(Is this not how you message?)

1957
01:05:33,568 --> 01:05:35,067
You should just call.

1958
01:05:35,068 --> 01:05:37,138
How can you write...

1959
01:05:37,139 --> 01:05:38,138
How long are you going to write?

1960
01:05:38,139 --> 01:05:39,896
You must have been surprised.

1961
01:05:40,009 --> 01:05:42,238
Is he sending this long message?

1962
01:05:42,239 --> 01:05:45,106
To read that, you'd have to click on "See All".

1963
01:05:45,208 --> 01:05:46,948
- I hate it. - It's too long.

1964
01:05:46,949 --> 01:05:48,578
You have to write short.

1965
01:05:48,579 --> 01:05:51,017
My answer is, "You must have been surprised."

1966
01:05:51,018 --> 01:05:52,017
But...

1967
01:05:52,018 --> 01:05:53,287
"Calm down."

1968
01:05:53,288 --> 01:05:55,317
"You must have been surprised. Try to calm down."

1969
01:05:55,318 --> 01:05:57,308
In 1, 2, 3.

1970
01:05:58,628 --> 01:06:00,658
(2 O cards and 3 X cards)

1971
01:06:00,659 --> 01:06:01,828
(Jae Seok failed to win a majority.)

1972
01:06:01,829 --> 01:06:03,468
- 2 O cards. - His partner has to fly.

1973
01:06:03,469 --> 01:06:05,598
(His partner, Jin Hee, has to fly off her chair.)

1974
01:06:05,599 --> 01:06:06,710
I'm sorry.

1975
01:06:06,739 --> 01:06:08,283
(Flying)

1976
01:06:09,239 --> 01:06:12,269
(It looks somehow stable.)

1977
01:06:12,538 --> 01:06:14,238
She didn't fly so far.

1978
01:06:14,239 --> 01:06:16,548
She didn't fly very far.

1979
01:06:16,549 --> 01:06:18,366
(Relaxed)

1980
01:06:18,978 --> 01:06:20,017
- Let me answer. - Let me answer.

1981
01:06:20,018 --> 01:06:21,178
- Let me answer. - Start.

1982
01:06:21,179 --> 01:06:22,548
(Haha gets the chance.)

1983
01:06:22,549 --> 01:06:24,618
- Give me just one chance. - Sit down. I figured it out.

1984
01:06:24,619 --> 01:06:26,087
- Just one chance. - This actually happened to me.

1985
01:06:26,088 --> 01:06:27,118
I have the perfect answer.

1986
01:06:27,119 --> 01:06:29,542
She sent those messages...

1987
01:06:29,829 --> 01:06:31,202
because some of it is dealt with.

1988
01:06:31,358 --> 01:06:32,570
So I replied,

1989
01:06:33,398 --> 01:06:34,842
"My car!"

1990
01:06:35,199 --> 01:06:37,298
- What? - With crying emojis.

1991
01:06:37,299 --> 01:06:38,783
My car!

1992
01:06:38,869 --> 01:06:41,191
(What?)

1993
01:06:41,199 --> 01:06:42,267
You said that first?

1994
01:06:42,268 --> 01:06:43,551
"But are you okay?"

1995
01:06:44,139 --> 01:06:46,578
- What? - It's, "My car!"

1996
01:06:46,579 --> 01:06:48,837
- It's not even worth to find out. - In 1, 2, 3.

1997
01:06:48,838 --> 01:06:50,566
(Will Haha's answer be right?)

1998
01:06:51,208 --> 01:06:52,678
- You only got two. - See?

1999
01:06:52,679 --> 01:06:54,018
That wasn't the answer.

2000
01:06:54,019 --> 01:06:55,247
I needed just one more person.

2001
01:06:55,248 --> 01:06:56,417
Shall we move on to the next question?

2002
01:06:56,418 --> 01:06:57,518
The females can go this time.

2003
01:06:57,519 --> 01:06:59,758
- I definitely had the answer. - Good luck.

2004
01:06:59,759 --> 01:07:01,071
I got this.

2005
01:07:01,319 --> 01:07:02,772
Good luck, Jin Hee.

2006
01:07:03,458 --> 01:07:05,527
- I'm confident I can do this. - I think you'll be good at this.

2007
01:07:05,528 --> 01:07:06,657
I'm confident.

2008
01:07:06,658 --> 01:07:08,157
It's the same for you guys.

2009
01:07:08,158 --> 01:07:10,798
The females have to answer the questions...

2010
01:07:10,799 --> 01:07:13,337
which the males would be able to identify with.

2011
01:07:13,338 --> 01:07:14,551
Here we go.

2012
01:07:15,038 --> 01:07:16,237
I'm sure she can do.

2013
01:07:16,238 --> 01:07:17,508
(Baby, where are you?)

2014
01:07:17,509 --> 01:07:18,737
(Do you know what time it is? Where are you?)

2015
01:07:18,738 --> 01:07:20,108
(We were supposed to meet at 2 o'clock, it's 3 o'clock.)

2016
01:07:20,109 --> 01:07:21,478
(You're not even answering my phone call. What are you doing?)

2017
01:07:21,479 --> 01:07:22,877
(I'm so sorry, baby.)

2018
01:07:22,878 --> 01:07:24,178
(I lost track of time playing games.)

2019
01:07:24,179 --> 01:07:25,308
(I'll finish up and leave right after.)

2020
01:07:25,309 --> 01:07:27,048
This makes me annoyed.

2021
01:07:27,049 --> 01:07:28,648
(Her boyfriend is late as he was playing games.)

2022
01:07:28,649 --> 01:07:30,087
- This will make you annoyed. - Let me answer.

2023
01:07:30,088 --> 01:07:31,704
Take it slow!

2024
01:07:32,219 --> 01:07:33,518
(Let me answer!)

2025
01:07:33,519 --> 01:07:35,188
(Why are you so impatient?)

2026
01:07:35,189 --> 01:07:36,358
Let me answer.

2027
01:07:36,359 --> 01:07:37,428
(It's a difficult situation.)

2028
01:07:37,429 --> 01:07:39,728
"You can come when you're finished."

2029
01:07:39,729 --> 01:07:42,586
"Or should I go to the PC cafe you're at?"

2030
01:07:42,698 --> 01:07:44,689
You would say that? Stop lying!

2031
01:07:44,698 --> 01:07:45,728
You would never say that!

2032
01:07:45,729 --> 01:07:48,798
(She's being criticized for her fake response.)

2033
01:07:48,799 --> 01:07:50,037
(He's still rooting for her as he's on the same team with her.)

2034
01:07:50,038 --> 01:07:51,207
That's very kind.

2035
01:07:51,208 --> 01:07:53,277
The last, "Should I go to the PC cafe you're at?"...

2036
01:07:53,278 --> 01:07:54,478
could be the giveaway for them.

2037
01:07:54,479 --> 01:07:56,508
It sounded a bit scary.

2038
01:07:56,509 --> 01:07:58,777
Because she's only going so she can check who he's with.

2039
01:07:58,778 --> 01:08:00,548
- Wait a minute. - That was her answer.

2040
01:08:00,549 --> 01:08:01,848
In 1, 2, 3.

2041
01:08:01,849 --> 01:08:04,888
(What will the panels say about her answer?)

2042
01:08:04,889 --> 01:08:06,231
In 1, 2, 3.

2043
01:08:07,088 --> 01:08:09,287
(She got 4 X cards and 1 O card.)

2044
01:08:09,288 --> 01:08:10,787
- She has more X cards. - Why?

2045
01:08:10,788 --> 01:08:12,558
(She failed to get the majority vote.)

2046
01:08:12,559 --> 01:08:14,457
I want to play games with my boyfriend.

2047
01:08:14,458 --> 01:08:16,228
It's because they haven't met a girlfriend like her!

2048
01:08:16,229 --> 01:08:17,627
That means she's coming to see you.

2049
01:08:17,628 --> 01:08:18,798
I wanted to play together.

2050
01:08:18,799 --> 01:08:19,837
It sounded threatening.

2051
01:08:19,838 --> 01:08:20,898
It was a bit threatening.

2052
01:08:20,899 --> 01:08:23,237
- You sounded upset. - I told you not to go first.

2053
01:08:23,238 --> 01:08:25,662
In 1, 2, 3.

2054
01:08:25,668 --> 01:08:27,224
(He's flying in the air.)

2055
01:08:28,439 --> 01:08:31,577
(With a stabilized pose and a calm expression, )

2056
01:08:31,578 --> 01:08:35,791
(that was a perfect example of Flying Chairs.)

2057
01:08:35,948 --> 01:08:37,117
That was really amazing.

2058
01:08:37,118 --> 01:08:38,487
You guys don't love her enough.

2059
01:08:38,488 --> 01:08:39,648
It's too threatening for her to come.

2060
01:08:39,649 --> 01:08:41,688
- It's frightening. - Yes.

2061
01:08:41,689 --> 01:08:43,274
- Let me answer! - What are you doing?

2062
01:08:43,828 --> 01:08:45,058
You don't know beans about men!

2063
01:08:45,059 --> 01:08:48,558
(You don't know beans about men!)

2064
01:08:48,559 --> 01:08:50,068
I do know men.

2065
01:08:50,069 --> 01:08:51,310
Let me answer.

2066
01:08:51,599 --> 01:08:54,397
"I only have one last game left. Can I come when it's over?"

2067
01:08:54,538 --> 01:08:55,768
I say, "All right, Baby."

2068
01:08:55,769 --> 01:08:57,008
"You said it's one last game,"

2069
01:08:57,009 --> 01:08:59,008
"so promise you'll play just one more."

2070
01:08:59,009 --> 01:09:01,178
("Promise you'll play just one more.")

2071
01:09:01,179 --> 01:09:04,048
- I swear if she got those texts, - She would never say that.

2072
01:09:04,049 --> 01:09:06,271
she would have replied, "You little punk."

2073
01:09:06,948 --> 01:09:07,978
Hey!

2074
01:09:07,979 --> 01:09:10,412
("You little punk.")

2075
01:09:10,549 --> 01:09:12,018
- I would never say that. - I can imagine.

2076
01:09:12,019 --> 01:09:14,388
(He's framing her for her fake response.)

2077
01:09:14,389 --> 01:09:15,858
In 1, 2, 3.

2078
01:09:15,859 --> 01:09:17,374
(What will the panels say about Ji Hyo's unusual answer?)

2079
01:09:18,429 --> 01:09:20,520
(She got 3 O cards and 2 X cards.)

2080
01:09:20,859 --> 01:09:22,298
(Ji Hyo succeeds with the majority vote.)

2081
01:09:22,299 --> 01:09:23,783
Okay!

2082
01:09:23,828 --> 01:09:25,041
This is unbelievable.

2083
01:09:25,069 --> 01:09:27,098
- I did good, right? - Ji Hyo actually got it.

2084
01:09:27,099 --> 01:09:28,298
I did well.

2085
01:09:28,299 --> 01:09:30,733
- Ji Hyo actually got it. - Let me answer!

2086
01:09:31,009 --> 01:09:32,167
(Now everyone wants to say their answers.)

2087
01:09:32,168 --> 01:09:33,724
Stop it!

2088
01:09:35,078 --> 01:09:36,522
Let me answer.

2089
01:09:36,948 --> 01:09:38,090
Don't be too cheesy.

2090
01:09:38,349 --> 01:09:41,377
"I see, Baby. I was worried since you weren't calling back."

2091
01:09:41,378 --> 01:09:42,518
That's a fake respond.

2092
01:09:42,519 --> 01:09:45,048
(That's a fake respond.)

2093
01:09:45,049 --> 01:09:47,785
(Booing)

2094
01:09:48,118 --> 01:09:49,287
That's a fake respond.

2095
01:09:49,288 --> 01:09:51,027
(They're all booing for her disingenuous reply.)

2096
01:09:51,028 --> 01:09:53,887
- "Call me when you're finished." - That's good.

2097
01:09:54,729 --> 01:09:56,890
That's good. It's not uncomfortable at all.

2098
01:09:57,528 --> 01:09:59,938
(What will the panels say about Ji In's reply?)

2099
01:09:59,939 --> 01:10:01,919
- In 1, 2, 3. - Her reply was so innocent.

2100
01:10:02,569 --> 01:10:03,907
(She got 3 O cards and 2 X cards.)

2101
01:10:03,908 --> 01:10:05,438
- Yes! - She got it.

2102
01:10:05,439 --> 01:10:07,126
(She succeeds with the majority vote.)

2103
01:10:08,238 --> 01:10:09,377
Wait a second.

2104
01:10:09,378 --> 01:10:11,631
Don't think about it like she's your actual girlfriend.

2105
01:10:13,418 --> 01:10:15,218
It has to be from someone you actually dated...

2106
01:10:15,219 --> 01:10:17,848
or the one you're currently seeing.

2107
01:10:17,849 --> 01:10:19,018
That was a good answer.

2108
01:10:19,019 --> 01:10:20,718
Start. Let me answer.

2109
01:10:20,719 --> 01:10:21,987
Let me answer.

2110
01:10:21,988 --> 01:10:23,888
(He cannot hide his anxiety.)

2111
01:10:23,889 --> 01:10:24,957
Do well.

2112
01:10:24,958 --> 01:10:27,157
Imagine that we've been a couple for a few years.

2113
01:10:27,158 --> 01:10:28,774
She can't go up to them, can she?

2114
01:10:28,799 --> 01:10:30,898
- It's cool out here, isn't it? - It is.

2115
01:10:30,899 --> 01:10:33,362
"Okay. Come when you're done."

2116
01:10:34,238 --> 01:10:35,398
She's so cute!

2117
01:10:35,399 --> 01:10:37,732
"Okay. Come when you're done."

2118
01:10:37,908 --> 01:10:39,508
(Giggling)

2119
01:10:39,509 --> 01:10:42,508
- She's so cute! - What I just did was an emoji.

2120
01:10:42,509 --> 01:10:44,747
She's just trying to make it the right answer.

2121
01:10:44,748 --> 01:10:46,008
That was great.

2122
01:10:46,009 --> 01:10:48,117
Our lighting director laughed.

2123
01:10:48,118 --> 01:10:50,311
- In 1, 2, 3. - In 1, 2, 3.

2124
01:10:50,988 --> 01:10:53,786
(She got all X cards.)

2125
01:10:54,219 --> 01:10:56,318
(So Min failed because of too much cuteness.)

2126
01:10:56,319 --> 01:10:58,228
- Why! - Stop doing that.

2127
01:10:58,229 --> 01:11:00,457
- That's enough. - Why is it okay for them to do it?

2128
01:11:00,458 --> 01:11:02,045
Why is it okay for them to do it?

2129
01:11:02,229 --> 01:11:03,468
Why won't you give me an O card?

2130
01:11:03,469 --> 01:11:05,327
Go look into the mirror.

2131
01:11:05,328 --> 01:11:07,068
Just stay put!

2132
01:11:07,069 --> 01:11:08,697
So Min, stop doing that.

2133
01:11:08,698 --> 01:11:10,588
(So Min, stop doing that.)

2134
01:11:12,109 --> 01:11:13,422
I'm sorry.

2135
01:11:14,139 --> 01:11:17,108
(He flies in the air skillfully one more time.)

2136
01:11:17,278 --> 01:11:21,548
(This is the class of a Flying Chair veteran.)

2137
01:11:21,549 --> 01:11:23,318
- Let's switch males and females. - Yes.

2138
01:11:23,319 --> 01:11:24,388
(They switch seats for the males to do the quiz.)

2139
01:11:24,389 --> 01:11:26,672
- Ji Hyo. - Good job.

2140
01:11:26,859 --> 01:11:28,518
Here's the next question.

2141
01:11:28,519 --> 01:11:30,428
(Will the male group succeed this time?)

2142
01:11:30,429 --> 01:11:32,228
You have just found out...

2143
01:11:32,229 --> 01:11:35,188
that the lottery you bought your girlfriend won the grand prize.

2144
01:11:35,498 --> 01:11:38,024
"This is awesome. I won the lottery."

2145
01:11:38,729 --> 01:11:40,354
"I can't believe this. What should I do?"

2146
01:11:40,399 --> 01:11:41,782
- Let me answer. - Let me answer.

2147
01:11:42,069 --> 01:11:43,351
This is quite difficult.

2148
01:11:43,738 --> 01:11:47,617
"It's dangerous for you to be alone right now."

2149
01:11:49,208 --> 01:11:50,390
"Trust me."

2150
01:11:50,578 --> 01:11:51,963
You sound like a fraud.

2151
01:11:52,009 --> 01:11:53,160
"Trust me."

2152
01:11:53,208 --> 01:11:55,247
- You sound like a fraud. - Hey.

2153
01:11:55,248 --> 01:11:56,617
Is this a thriller film?

2154
01:11:56,618 --> 01:11:58,018
(Who would trust you?)

2155
01:11:58,019 --> 01:11:59,735
It sounds like you're going to kidnap her.

2156
01:12:02,189 --> 01:12:03,542
I'm sorry, Seung Hee.

2157
01:12:03,658 --> 01:12:05,728
(His partner, Seung Hee flies into the air.)

2158
01:12:05,729 --> 01:12:07,928
(Goodbye, Seung Hee.)

2159
01:12:07,929 --> 01:12:08,997
Let me answer.

2160
01:12:08,998 --> 01:12:10,644
I won't be too cheesy.

2161
01:12:10,799 --> 01:12:12,587
This is my not-so-cheesy reply.

2162
01:12:13,229 --> 01:12:14,837
(She's anxious.)

2163
01:12:14,838 --> 01:12:16,237
"Congratulations, Baby."

2164
01:12:16,238 --> 01:12:17,337
"Just give me 300 dollars."

2165
01:12:17,338 --> 01:12:20,907
("Congratulations, Baby. Just give me 300 dollars.")

2166
01:12:20,908 --> 01:12:22,837
- Did he say, "300 dollars"? - That wasn't cheesy at all.

2167
01:12:22,838 --> 01:12:24,207
- That was cute. - That wasn't cheesy.

2168
01:12:24,208 --> 01:12:25,508
In 1, 2, 3.

2169
01:12:25,509 --> 01:12:26,777
(What will the panels say about Jae Seok's reply?)

2170
01:12:26,778 --> 01:12:29,000
(He got 4 O cards and 1 X card.)

2171
01:12:29,748 --> 01:12:31,087
(Jae Seok succeeds with the majority vote.)

2172
01:12:31,088 --> 01:12:32,417
That actually worked?

2173
01:12:32,418 --> 01:12:34,657
- How did that work? - Let me answer.

2174
01:12:34,658 --> 01:12:36,405
Can we listen to their thought? Shouldn't we?

2175
01:12:36,889 --> 01:12:38,558
I would be willing to give 300 dollars.

2176
01:12:38,559 --> 01:12:39,770
See?

2177
01:12:40,128 --> 01:12:41,815
- Let me answer. - Let me answer.

2178
01:12:41,958 --> 01:12:43,058
I said it first.

2179
01:12:43,059 --> 01:12:46,977
I'll be calming the minds of the panels.

2180
01:12:47,069 --> 01:12:49,337
"Wow. Amazing. What? Good luck."

2181
01:12:49,338 --> 01:12:50,925
"That's amazing."

2182
01:12:51,738 --> 01:12:52,768
And lastly, "We're splitting it in half, right?"

2183
01:12:52,769 --> 01:12:55,233
("We're splitting it in half, right?")

2184
01:12:55,578 --> 01:12:57,063
(It made her sigh.)

2185
01:12:57,109 --> 01:12:58,348
What did he just say?

2186
01:12:58,349 --> 01:13:01,077
"We're splitting it in half, right?"

2187
01:13:01,078 --> 01:13:03,218
- In 1, 2, 3. - It sounds relaxing, isn't it?

2188
01:13:03,219 --> 01:13:04,663
(What will the panels say about his reply?)

2189
01:13:05,088 --> 01:13:07,341
- In 1, 2, 3. - It sounds relaxing, isn't it?

2190
01:13:07,788 --> 01:13:10,283
(He got all X cards.)

2191
01:13:10,488 --> 01:13:12,287
You can't ask for money.

2192
01:13:12,288 --> 01:13:14,258
You can't ask them for money.

2193
01:13:14,259 --> 01:13:15,527
It's all theirs.

2194
01:13:15,528 --> 01:13:17,298
They won't give us a penny!

2195
01:13:17,299 --> 01:13:19,697
(They won't give us a penny!)

2196
01:13:19,698 --> 01:13:22,497
They're greedy people!

2197
01:13:22,498 --> 01:13:23,907
They know nothing but money!

2198
01:13:23,908 --> 01:13:26,797
- The panels are mean. - I bought you that lottery!

2199
01:13:26,809 --> 01:13:30,142
(So Min flies into the air.)

2200
01:13:31,479 --> 01:13:34,548
Haha and Ji In are in the first place.

2201
01:13:34,849 --> 01:13:36,318
Jong Kook and Ji Hyo are in the second place.

2202
01:13:36,319 --> 01:13:37,417
That's a relief.

2203
01:13:37,418 --> 01:13:39,872
Seok Jin and So Min are in third place.

2204
01:13:40,658 --> 01:13:42,982
- All right. - We were not that terrible.

2205
01:13:43,088 --> 01:13:44,587
It's time to draw the last card.

2206
01:13:44,588 --> 01:13:45,901
It's the last one?

2207
01:13:45,988 --> 01:13:48,457
Haha, Ji In,

2208
01:13:48,458 --> 01:13:50,627
Jong Kook, Ji Hyo, Seok Jin, and So Min...

2209
01:13:50,628 --> 01:13:52,167
will draw the cards first.

2210
01:13:52,168 --> 01:13:53,381
Are you going first?

2211
01:13:53,469 --> 01:13:54,811
- Come here. - Like this?

2212
01:13:55,399 --> 01:13:56,837
How many do you have?

2213
01:13:56,838 --> 01:13:58,608
- I have... - We have...

2214
01:13:58,609 --> 01:14:00,308
- We don't have that many. - How many do you have?

2215
01:14:00,309 --> 01:14:02,207
- We have a bad one. - You have one disadvantage?

2216
01:14:02,208 --> 01:14:04,431
- We should all go with O cards. - Yes, please.

2217
01:14:04,778 --> 01:14:06,877
(They can all win a prize badge each when they all submit O cards.)

2218
01:14:06,878 --> 01:14:08,263
- Yes. - Let's do it.

2219
01:14:08,278 --> 01:14:09,518
- Yes. - Let's win one.

2220
01:14:09,519 --> 01:14:10,518
Then we're back to zero.

2221
01:14:10,519 --> 01:14:12,318
So Min, if you deceive me,

2222
01:14:12,319 --> 01:14:13,758
I'm serious about this.

2223
01:14:13,759 --> 01:14:15,233
I won't be mad at you,

2224
01:14:15,719 --> 01:14:17,457
- but I'll remember it forever. - Why would you say that?

2225
01:14:17,458 --> 01:14:20,963
Okay, in 1, 2, 3.

2226
01:14:22,799 --> 01:14:26,568
(The final winner wins an exclusive Korean beef gift set.)

2227
01:14:26,569 --> 01:14:32,325
(The last place team has to do an indoor skydiving.)

2228
01:14:32,769 --> 01:14:33,938
Three!

2229
01:14:33,939 --> 01:14:35,678
(What will the top 3 teams choose?)

2230
01:14:35,679 --> 01:14:37,207
We all chose O cards!

2231
01:14:37,208 --> 01:14:39,678
(They all chose O cards.)

2232
01:14:39,679 --> 01:14:41,777
- We all chose O cards. - See?

2233
01:14:41,778 --> 01:14:43,218
- See? - I was going to choose an X card.

2234
01:14:43,219 --> 01:14:45,388
The three teams in the first place are...

2235
01:14:45,389 --> 01:14:47,957
Seok Jin and So Min, Kwang Soo and Rothy,

2236
01:14:47,958 --> 01:14:50,383
and Haha and Ji In each with one prize badge.

2237
01:14:50,528 --> 01:14:52,307
- What if... - The teams in the last place...

2238
01:14:52,328 --> 01:14:53,844
If we choose a different one from them,

2239
01:14:54,158 --> 01:14:56,968
- then we're the sole number one. - Yes.

2240
01:14:56,969 --> 01:14:58,928
If either Se Chan or Jae Seok's team choose...

2241
01:14:58,929 --> 01:15:01,398
the minority card, you will be tied in the first place.

2242
01:15:01,399 --> 01:15:02,667
(If they choose a different card, they won't be in the last place.)

2243
01:15:02,668 --> 01:15:04,907
- In one... - Just choose any card you like.

2244
01:15:04,908 --> 01:15:06,438
In 1, 2, 3.

2245
01:15:06,439 --> 01:15:08,732
(Which team will win the prize badge by choosing a different one?)

2246
01:15:09,838 --> 01:15:13,747
(Kwang Soo and Rothy: O card)

2247
01:15:13,748 --> 01:15:17,153
(Jae Seok and Jin Hee: X card)

2248
01:15:17,788 --> 01:15:21,929
(The result is up to the choice of Se Chan and Seung Hee.)

2249
01:15:22,559 --> 01:15:23,688
It's an X card!

2250
01:15:23,689 --> 01:15:27,062
(Se Chan: O card, Kwang Soo: O card, Jae Seok: X card)

2251
01:15:28,198 --> 01:15:31,968
(Jae Seok and Jin Hee win 1 prize badge.)

2252
01:15:31,969 --> 01:15:34,798
(Jae Seok and Jin Hee are no longer in the last place.)

2253
01:15:34,799 --> 01:15:35,837
That's awesome.

2254
01:15:35,838 --> 01:15:37,323
He's in the last place now.

2255
01:15:37,368 --> 01:15:40,407
Se Chan and Seung Hee are the only ones in the last place right now.

2256
01:15:40,408 --> 01:15:42,963
That's the worst.

2257
01:15:44,849 --> 01:15:47,445
Now, Seok Jin and So Min, and Haha and Ji In...

2258
01:15:47,748 --> 01:15:49,218
will play a game to be number one.

2259
01:15:49,219 --> 01:15:50,764
- In 1, 2, 3. - In 1, 2, 3.

2260
01:15:51,849 --> 01:15:53,018
(Seok Jin and So Min: X card)

2261
01:15:53,019 --> 01:15:54,758
(Haha and Ji In: O card)

2262
01:15:54,759 --> 01:15:55,931
It's an O card!

2263
01:15:56,458 --> 01:15:57,957
She's the queen of O cards.

2264
01:15:57,958 --> 01:15:59,327
(Haha and Ji In wins the grand prize by drawing an O card.)

2265
01:15:59,328 --> 01:16:00,844
(I thought we could finally win this time.)

2266
01:16:01,599 --> 01:16:04,098
This team will be given Korean beef gift sets and penalty exemption.

2267
01:16:04,099 --> 01:16:05,987
Gosh, it's Korean beef.

2268
01:16:06,969 --> 01:16:08,568
(Thank you for the beef.)

2269
01:16:08,569 --> 01:16:10,037
It's time for the last penalty.

2270
01:16:10,038 --> 01:16:12,008
- Se Chan and Seung Hee... - Yes.

2271
01:16:12,009 --> 01:16:14,462
may choose a couple to take with you guys.

2272
01:16:14,578 --> 01:16:16,225
They were so happy.

2273
01:16:16,738 --> 01:16:19,777
It was difficult to watch.

2274
01:16:19,778 --> 01:16:21,548
Can you choose the teams that are ruled out first?

2275
01:16:21,549 --> 01:16:22,848
- Please do. - The teams that are excluded.

2276
01:16:22,849 --> 01:16:24,117
So that we can be at peace.

2277
01:16:24,118 --> 01:16:26,987
First off, since we've been working together...

2278
01:16:26,988 --> 01:16:28,718
with Ji Hyo and Jong Kook, they're safe from the penalty.

2279
01:16:28,719 --> 01:16:30,218
- Thank you so much. - Yes.

2280
01:16:30,219 --> 01:16:31,428
- Thank you. - I guess...

2281
01:16:31,429 --> 01:16:33,087
you get back what you give.

2282
01:16:33,088 --> 01:16:34,428
We worked hard for it.

2283
01:16:34,429 --> 01:16:37,934
The team that picks an X card will receive the penalty with us.

2284
01:16:38,069 --> 01:16:39,298
Seok Jin, pick one.

2285
01:16:39,299 --> 01:16:40,551
I'll pick one.

2286
01:16:40,569 --> 01:16:41,638
Seok Jin.

2287
01:16:41,639 --> 01:16:43,907
I wish you pick the cross straightaway.

2288
01:16:43,908 --> 01:16:45,907
- Please. - Seriously.

2289
01:16:45,908 --> 01:16:47,707
- Please. - Make it hilarious for us.

2290
01:16:47,708 --> 01:16:49,052
Seok Jin, I beg you.

2291
01:16:49,208 --> 01:16:51,348
I really don't want the penalty today.

2292
01:16:51,349 --> 01:16:53,648
I even reached the finals for So Min.

2293
01:16:53,649 --> 01:16:54,818
Show it to us.

2294
01:16:54,819 --> 01:16:56,394
(Seok Jin and So Min choose their card.)

2295
01:16:57,219 --> 01:16:59,188
- Let's do this. - I'm anxious.

2296
01:16:59,189 --> 01:17:00,318
- I feel uneasy. - Show it to us.

2297
01:17:00,319 --> 01:17:01,975
In 1, 2...

2298
01:17:04,189 --> 01:17:06,612
(Desperate for him to choose the X card.)

2299
01:17:07,059 --> 01:17:11,947
(Which card did Seok Jin and So Min pick?)

2300
01:17:15,498 --> 01:17:19,913
(Seok Jin and So Min chose the O card.)

2301
01:17:20,738 --> 01:17:23,304
(We're doomed.)

2302
01:17:24,849 --> 01:17:26,525
- No. - We're safe.

2303
01:17:26,649 --> 01:17:28,193
Ji Hyo.

2304
01:17:28,679 --> 01:17:30,031
Didn't I do well?

2305
01:17:30,078 --> 01:17:31,648
The person who loses picks first.

2306
01:17:31,649 --> 01:17:33,002
Rock-paper-scissors.

2307
01:17:34,819 --> 01:17:36,030
You pick first.

2308
01:17:36,519 --> 01:17:37,802
Just pick any of them.

2309
01:17:37,929 --> 01:17:39,127
All right, the other team now.

2310
01:17:39,128 --> 01:17:40,613
Show them to us at the same time.

2311
01:17:41,059 --> 01:17:42,798
- I'm curious about this. - I'm so nervous.

2312
01:17:42,799 --> 01:17:44,213
Two...

2313
01:17:44,628 --> 01:17:45,667
Three.

2314
01:17:45,668 --> 01:17:48,466
(Which team will be left back when others can head back home?)

2315
01:17:49,738 --> 01:17:51,082
We're done.

2316
01:17:52,109 --> 01:17:54,277
(Kwang Soo and Rothy choose the penalty X card.)

2317
01:17:54,278 --> 01:17:55,777
- We're safe. - We're done.

2318
01:17:55,778 --> 01:17:57,971
We're safe.

2319
01:17:57,979 --> 01:18:00,108
We didn't plan this.

2320
01:18:00,109 --> 01:18:01,617
- We didn't. - We didn't plan this at all.

2321
01:18:01,618 --> 01:18:03,437
(Kwang Soo and Rothy receive the final penalty.)

2322
01:18:03,988 --> 01:18:05,348
(After the shoot, when everyone left...)

2323
01:18:05,349 --> 01:18:06,518
- Don't tell me this is a dream. - My goodness.

2324
01:18:06,519 --> 01:18:07,718
Is this it?

2325
01:18:07,719 --> 01:18:10,117
(Indoor skydiving with a top speed of 360km per hour)

2326
01:18:10,118 --> 01:18:12,279
(The first runner is Se Chan.)

2327
01:18:13,528 --> 01:18:14,842
He's going.

2328
01:18:14,899 --> 01:18:16,110
You can do it!

2329
01:18:16,628 --> 01:18:19,861
(He gets uglier because of the pressure for being first.)

2330
01:18:20,229 --> 01:18:24,107
(He enters the range with assistance from the coach.)

2331
01:18:26,069 --> 01:18:28,108
(But...)

2332
01:18:28,109 --> 01:18:29,725
He looks so ugly.

2333
01:18:29,939 --> 01:18:31,827
(Kwang Soo is shocked by his appearance.)

2334
01:18:33,349 --> 01:18:35,873
- He looks so funny. - Just look at him.

2335
01:18:35,979 --> 01:18:38,787
(His nose starts running as soon as he enters.)

2336
01:18:38,788 --> 01:18:40,232
You have a runny nose!

2337
01:18:40,988 --> 01:18:42,705
Please close your mouth.

2338
01:18:43,059 --> 01:18:44,342
You have a runny nose!

2339
01:18:44,828 --> 01:18:46,827
His snot is reaching his lips.

2340
01:18:46,828 --> 01:18:49,021
(Screaming)

2341
01:18:49,929 --> 01:18:51,919
How does his mouth look like that?

2342
01:18:52,429 --> 01:18:53,768
He's going up.

2343
01:18:53,769 --> 01:18:56,526
(He shoots up vertically straightaway.)

2344
01:18:56,799 --> 01:18:58,667
(Like getting sucked into a black hole, )

2345
01:18:58,668 --> 01:19:00,053
(he shoots up to 20m high.)

2346
01:19:00,269 --> 01:19:02,577
(The higher he goes, the wider his mouth opens.)

2347
01:19:02,578 --> 01:19:03,992
He's spinning. Where's he going?

2348
01:19:04,748 --> 01:19:07,000
(Jaw dropping)

2349
01:19:07,748 --> 01:19:09,133
Look at his face.

2350
01:19:10,448 --> 01:19:12,818
- He's smiling. - He made eye contact with me.

2351
01:19:12,819 --> 01:19:14,374
That was frightening.

2352
01:19:14,819 --> 01:19:17,688
(After Se Chan's skydive that might appear in your nightmare, )

2353
01:19:17,689 --> 01:19:19,327
(Seung Hee and Rothy try their best to maintain their looks.)

2354
01:19:19,328 --> 01:19:20,672
Off she goes.

2355
01:19:21,099 --> 01:19:22,228
(Seung Hee shows...)

2356
01:19:22,229 --> 01:19:24,327
(an example of a perfect skydive.)

2357
01:19:24,328 --> 01:19:25,439
She's good.

2358
01:19:25,868 --> 01:19:27,197
How is that possible?

2359
01:19:27,198 --> 01:19:28,968
Why doesn't her mouth open?

2360
01:19:28,969 --> 01:19:30,407
What's this?

2361
01:19:30,408 --> 01:19:32,367
It looks easy right? Just wait for your turn.

2362
01:19:32,368 --> 01:19:34,407
(It's finally alien Kwang Soo's turn.)

2363
01:19:34,408 --> 01:19:35,752
He's starting.

2364
01:19:36,139 --> 01:19:38,478
- He looks pale. - That's what happens to your lips.

2365
01:19:38,479 --> 01:19:39,907
- You're right. - That's what happens.

2366
01:19:39,908 --> 01:19:41,577
- His mouth is opening. - He has his mouth opened.

2367
01:19:41,578 --> 01:19:42,848
He's too tall.

2368
01:19:42,849 --> 01:19:43,947
What's happening?

2369
01:19:43,948 --> 01:19:45,987
(He hasn't even entered yet but his expression changes first.)

2370
01:19:45,988 --> 01:19:47,048
What's wrong with his face?

2371
01:19:47,049 --> 01:19:48,157
My goodness.

2372
01:19:48,158 --> 01:19:49,688
What's wrong with his face? Did I look the same?

2373
01:19:49,689 --> 01:19:50,787
- Yes. - Did I?

2374
01:19:50,788 --> 01:19:51,928
You were worse.

2375
01:19:51,929 --> 01:19:53,388
I think you looked similar to him.

2376
01:19:53,389 --> 01:19:54,510
(He tries to rely on the wind.)

2377
01:19:55,628 --> 01:19:57,072
I think you looked similar to him.

2378
01:19:57,899 --> 01:20:00,050
(An alien of 2m falls down.)

2379
01:20:01,038 --> 01:20:03,190
That's hilarious. Look at his lips.

2380
01:20:05,269 --> 01:20:06,337
He's about to go up.

2381
01:20:06,338 --> 01:20:07,691
Doesn't he have to get ready first?

2382
01:20:07,809 --> 01:20:09,223
This is shocking.

2383
01:20:09,708 --> 01:20:11,466
His face is shocking.

2384
01:20:12,578 --> 01:20:14,568
(Why am I sinking?)

2385
01:20:14,778 --> 01:20:16,877
(Look at his face. Did we look as bad as him?)

2386
01:20:16,878 --> 01:20:18,388
- Was I that bad? - Well...

2387
01:20:18,389 --> 01:20:20,884
- You were worse. - He's drooling.

2388
01:20:20,988 --> 01:20:22,433
He's drooling.

2389
01:20:22,658 --> 01:20:24,305
I feel bad for the coach.

2390
01:20:24,658 --> 01:20:26,058
He's about to go up.

2391
01:20:26,059 --> 01:20:27,327
He's going up.

2392
01:20:27,328 --> 01:20:28,742
Off he goes.

2393
01:20:29,458 --> 01:20:31,650
(He shoots up.)

2394
01:20:33,838 --> 01:20:35,516
Weren't you scared up there?

2395
01:20:35,838 --> 01:20:37,707
(Screaming)

2396
01:20:37,708 --> 01:20:40,308
(His face tells us how scary it is.)

2397
01:20:40,309 --> 01:20:42,938
(Thankfully, the 2m-tall alien seems to be doing fine.)

2398
01:20:42,939 --> 01:20:44,222
Did my mouth look like that too?

2399
01:20:45,109 --> 01:20:46,594
What's wrong with his mouth.

2400
01:20:51,649 --> 01:20:53,718
(The alien makes an emergency landing.)

2401
01:20:53,719 --> 01:20:56,415
(It's a complete gift set from the ugly man.)

2402
01:20:56,988 --> 01:20:58,157
Goodness.

2403
01:20:58,158 --> 01:21:00,612
He keeps doing that.

2404
01:21:00,828 --> 01:21:03,354
Why am I not done yet?

2405
01:21:03,868 --> 01:21:04,928
(The coach will give up soon.)

2406
01:21:04,929 --> 01:21:06,848
The coach is going to give up on him.

2407
01:21:07,399 --> 01:21:10,842
(Why am I not done yet?)

2408
01:21:11,338 --> 01:21:12,682
Look at him.

2409
01:21:14,878 --> 01:21:16,907
(Why are you laughing at me?)

2410
01:21:16,908 --> 01:21:19,201
He seems more relaxed now.

2411
01:21:19,479 --> 01:21:22,074
(Kwang Soo just managed to complete his flight.)

2412
01:21:22,618 --> 01:21:24,537
(Gosh)

2413
01:21:24,719 --> 01:21:26,840
You have to watch this episode to see your face.

2414
01:21:26,918 --> 01:21:29,587
- You have to. - You just escaped your aquarium.

2415
01:21:29,588 --> 01:21:31,058
What do you mean by that?

2416
01:21:31,059 --> 01:21:32,558
- That was scary. - Now...

2417
01:21:32,559 --> 01:21:34,627
You have completed today's penalty.

2418
01:21:34,628 --> 01:21:37,598
(We would like to thank Song Ji In, Jang Jin Hee, Seung Hee, and Rothy.)

2419
01:21:39,328 --> 01:21:41,997
(We would like to invite our viewers to the Running Man Fan-Meet.)

2420
01:21:41,998 --> 01:21:45,169
(More details on our official website.)
