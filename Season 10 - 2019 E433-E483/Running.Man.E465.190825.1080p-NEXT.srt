1
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,944
(On one rainy day that subsided the heatwave,)

2
00:00:09,470 --> 00:00:11,869
(there are...)

3
00:00:11,869 --> 00:00:14,915
(mysterious-looking wigs.)

4
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:16,840
(Who do these wigs belong to?)

5
00:00:16,840 --> 00:00:18,485
- Hello. - Hello.

6
00:00:19,410 --> 00:00:21,250
Are those for me?

7
00:00:21,250 --> 00:00:22,849
- Those are my wigs? - Yes.

8
00:00:22,849 --> 00:00:24,780
There are a lot of wigs indeed.

9
00:00:24,780 --> 00:00:26,264
(Seok Jin became the owner of the wigs because...)

10
00:00:26,449 --> 00:00:29,864
(Seok Jin was last in a race 3 weeks ago.)

11
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:33,235
(As the penalty, he will put on a costume for an opening segment.)

12
00:00:34,759 --> 00:00:37,000
I feel empty without the makeup.

13
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:38,329
The shape of your head is nice.

14
00:00:38,329 --> 00:00:39,469
(The shape of your head is nice.)

15
00:00:39,469 --> 00:00:40,575
- Hey. - Yes?

16
00:00:40,729 --> 00:00:42,145
- Really? - Yes.

17
00:00:42,439 --> 00:00:44,414
No, you're being nice.

18
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:45,944
I mean it.

19
00:00:46,769 --> 00:00:48,269
(As he shows off his nice head,)

20
00:00:48,269 --> 00:00:51,654
(his head is getting bald little by little.)

21
00:00:52,450 --> 00:00:54,350
(When Seok Jin is getting ready...)

22
00:00:54,350 --> 00:00:55,350
You're here.

23
00:00:55,350 --> 00:00:56,495
(Door sliding)

24
00:00:57,049 --> 00:00:59,525
(Someone is coming into the makeup room.)

25
00:01:00,350 --> 00:01:02,360
(Another member who will face the penalty with Seok Jin)

26
00:01:02,360 --> 00:01:05,159
(So Min is here.)

27
00:01:05,159 --> 00:01:08,334
(She only laughs out loud.)

28
00:01:09,159 --> 00:01:12,034
(She's about to go home as soon as she comes to work.)

29
00:01:12,769 --> 00:01:15,674
("What have I just seen?" She can't believe her eyes.)

30
00:01:16,769 --> 00:01:18,640
I just saw an egg in there.

31
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:20,445
(I just saw an egg in there.)

32
00:01:20,870 --> 00:01:23,984
Whatever. She doesn't know what's coming for her.

33
00:01:24,409 --> 00:01:26,250
- Why do you look like an egg? - What?

34
00:01:26,250 --> 00:01:28,349
- Hey, come here. - You look like a warty sea squirt.

35
00:01:28,349 --> 00:01:29,855
Hey, this is your future.

36
00:01:31,349 --> 00:01:33,989
(3 months ago, So Min put this down as the penalty.)

37
00:01:33,989 --> 00:01:37,635
(Leading the opening segment with a weird costume on for a male guest)

38
00:01:38,319 --> 00:01:42,635
(She will wear the worst costume only once for her acting career.)

39
00:01:43,159 --> 00:01:44,560
Please make me look pretty.

40
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:46,945
Hey, pretty? Jigsaw can't look pretty.

41
00:01:47,530 --> 00:01:49,069
It's embarrassing that only two of us are doing it.

42
00:01:49,069 --> 00:01:50,170
It's really embarrassing.

43
00:01:50,170 --> 00:01:51,799
They are going to make fun of me a lot.

44
00:01:51,799 --> 00:01:53,115
They'll make fun of you.

45
00:01:54,340 --> 00:01:57,140
But it's comforting. I don't think I could have done this alone.

46
00:01:57,140 --> 00:02:00,079
I don't know why Seok Jin and I are getting clumped up together.

47
00:02:00,079 --> 00:02:01,924
(I don't know why Seok Jin and I are getting clumped up together.)

48
00:02:02,620 --> 00:02:05,689
(Forbidden shot of So Min and Seok Jin together)

49
00:02:05,689 --> 00:02:08,620
Lately, whenever we draw for pairs, I end up pairing with you.

50
00:02:08,620 --> 00:02:10,989
Right. Why is that happening? Seriously.

51
00:02:10,989 --> 00:02:13,305
(The forbidden couple's makeup is about done.)

52
00:02:14,230 --> 00:02:15,559
(Meanwhile, without knowing anything...)

53
00:02:15,559 --> 00:02:18,059
- Hello. - It's raining today.

54
00:02:18,059 --> 00:02:19,630
It's nice to film indoors today.

55
00:02:19,630 --> 00:02:21,170
- Hello. - It's cool in here.

56
00:02:21,170 --> 00:02:22,600
This is nice.

57
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:23,769
- I'm sure you remember this place. - This place...

58
00:02:23,769 --> 00:02:24,970
- Of course. - It was for the hopscotch.

59
00:02:24,970 --> 00:02:26,610
- Right. We played hopscotch. - Back then,

60
00:02:26,610 --> 00:02:28,269
- That's right. - it was Se Chan's first appearance.

61
00:02:28,269 --> 00:02:29,480
- Right. - Really?

62
00:02:29,480 --> 00:02:30,715
(Se Chan filmed the show as a guest for the first time here.)

63
00:02:30,839 --> 00:02:32,809
- He's indeed the ace. - Na Rae was on the show with us.

64
00:02:32,809 --> 00:02:33,809
That's right.

65
00:02:33,809 --> 00:02:35,350
- I was first! - How did you know that?

66
00:02:35,350 --> 00:02:38,895
(Back then, winning the race was the focus instead of being funny.)

67
00:02:39,220 --> 00:02:41,350
Se Chan didn't do much during that episode.

68
00:02:41,350 --> 00:02:42,360
- Right. - It's because...

69
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:44,260
- I was with Seok Jin and Kwang Soo. - he was with me and Seok Jin.

70
00:02:44,260 --> 00:02:46,860
The thing is that I was a big fan of him,

71
00:02:46,860 --> 00:02:48,959
but when he was on our show, he wasn't funny.

72
00:02:48,959 --> 00:02:50,874
(Being brutally honest for the 2nd time)

73
00:02:51,459 --> 00:02:53,269
- I was very nervous back then. - Right now...

74
00:02:53,269 --> 00:02:55,230
I was wondering why he wasn't funny.

75
00:02:55,230 --> 00:02:56,470
(But he's funny now, so it's all right.)

76
00:02:56,470 --> 00:02:59,914
Anyway, I don't see Seok Jin...

77
00:03:00,010 --> 00:03:01,269
- and So Min. - So Min isn't here.

78
00:03:01,269 --> 00:03:04,679
Do you remember that they had the penalty of wearing a costume?

79
00:03:04,679 --> 00:03:05,880
Right.

80
00:03:05,880 --> 00:03:07,809
Today is the day.

81
00:03:07,809 --> 00:03:08,850
They will be doing it together.

82
00:03:08,850 --> 00:03:12,079
That must mean that So Min might be interested in this guest.

83
00:03:12,079 --> 00:03:13,249
- Is that so? - In the guest?

84
00:03:13,249 --> 00:03:15,220
Seriously. You are such a viper.

85
00:03:15,220 --> 00:03:16,360
This serves her right.

86
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:18,360
- I guess we're having guests today. - Of course.

87
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:20,059
- By the way... - All right.

88
00:03:20,059 --> 00:03:21,989
- We should... Yes. - Let's call them out.

89
00:03:21,989 --> 00:03:23,260
- Come on out. - Where are they?

90
00:03:23,260 --> 00:03:24,730
- Where are they? - Come on out.

91
00:03:24,730 --> 00:03:26,874
- I'm curious about their costume. - Same here.

92
00:03:27,070 --> 00:03:29,970
Oh, my!

93
00:03:29,970 --> 00:03:31,269
(Goodness!)

94
00:03:31,269 --> 00:03:32,269
Who is that?

95
00:03:32,269 --> 00:03:34,914
(Who is So Min dressed up as?)

96
00:03:35,809 --> 00:03:37,209
(So Min the Jigsaw)

97
00:03:37,209 --> 00:03:40,149
(Starting now, the penalty will begin.)

98
00:03:40,149 --> 00:03:42,420
- So Min, you're Jigsaw. - Goodness.

99
00:03:42,420 --> 00:03:43,720
Look at her.

100
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:45,820
- That was scary. - What was that?

101
00:03:45,820 --> 00:03:47,720
(It makes their jaws drop.)

102
00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:49,664
Hey, Seok Jin is the highlight.

103
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:51,760
- He's the highlight. - So Min.

104
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:53,760
- What is that? Oh, my. - Let me see.

105
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:55,335
- What is that? - He scared me.

106
00:03:55,899 --> 00:03:57,134
Who are you?

107
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:59,470
- He's the highlight. - Come here, So Min.

108
00:03:59,470 --> 00:04:00,829
- That's too harsh. - He's the highlight

109
00:04:00,829 --> 00:04:02,600
Hey, he's the highlight of the segment.

110
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:04,839
(Who on earth is Seok Jin dressed up as?)

111
00:04:04,839 --> 00:04:06,545
Hey, he's the highlight of the segment.

112
00:04:06,809 --> 00:04:08,070
(He's from the underworld.)

113
00:04:08,070 --> 00:04:11,140
(King Byeonseong)

114
00:04:11,140 --> 00:04:13,149
What is that? Goodness.

115
00:04:13,149 --> 00:04:14,685
- What is that? - He scared me.

116
00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:16,779
He's the highlight.

117
00:04:16,779 --> 00:04:18,989
- He's the highlight. - I wonder who the guests are...

118
00:04:18,989 --> 00:04:21,420
- for him to go such lengths. - This is amazing.

119
00:04:21,420 --> 00:04:22,759
Come here.

120
00:04:22,759 --> 00:04:24,259
You have brought the sin upon yourself.

121
00:04:24,259 --> 00:04:25,619
- He's so scary. What is that? - What is that?

122
00:04:25,619 --> 00:04:27,559
Wait, isn't that character in "Along with the Gods"?

123
00:04:27,559 --> 00:04:28,960
(Taking a selfie with King Byeonseong)

124
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:30,259
- What did he use for the makeup? - It looks nice.

125
00:04:30,259 --> 00:04:31,830
Hey, I've already forgotten about So Min.

126
00:04:31,830 --> 00:04:33,170
What's the name?

127
00:04:33,170 --> 00:04:34,569
- It's King Byeonseong. - "Along with the Gods".

128
00:04:34,569 --> 00:04:36,840
- He was in "Along with the Gods". - King Byeonseong in the movie.

129
00:04:36,840 --> 00:04:38,670
- Right, right. - "Along with the Gods"?

130
00:04:38,670 --> 00:04:40,439
They did a great job with that.

131
00:04:40,439 --> 00:04:41,840
Seok Jin, this is the real deal.

132
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:44,340
You think you won't look that awful next to Seok Jin.

133
00:04:44,340 --> 00:04:45,949
But yours is terrible too.

134
00:04:45,949 --> 00:04:47,410
For you, it has to be more shocking than Yondu.

135
00:04:47,410 --> 00:04:49,819
- That's true. - Right, no one can beat that.

136
00:04:49,819 --> 00:04:51,650
First, you need to be bald.

137
00:04:51,650 --> 00:04:54,324
Unbelievable. I didn't know I'd have to go this far.

138
00:04:54,749 --> 00:04:55,759
(Screaming)

139
00:04:55,759 --> 00:04:57,360
- This is so uncomfortable. - Come on.

140
00:04:57,360 --> 00:04:59,535
Seok Jin is trying to get all of his airtime in the opening segment.

141
00:04:59,629 --> 00:05:00,759
It took two hours.

142
00:05:00,759 --> 00:05:01,905
(Trying to get as much airtime as he can)

143
00:05:02,129 --> 00:05:03,274
That's not how you do it.

144
00:05:03,629 --> 00:05:05,629
Seok Jin, that's not how you do it.

145
00:05:05,629 --> 00:05:06,770
You guys,

146
00:05:06,770 --> 00:05:08,470
welcome to the underworld.

147
00:05:08,470 --> 00:05:09,615
(He hasn't seen "Along with the Gods".)

148
00:05:09,670 --> 00:05:12,770
First of all, our penalty isn't important right now.

149
00:05:12,770 --> 00:05:14,470
- We have guests today. - We're having guests now?

150
00:05:14,470 --> 00:05:16,214
- We should bring them in now. - Yes.

151
00:05:16,610 --> 00:05:20,084
We have special guests who have come to join Running Man today.

152
00:05:20,179 --> 00:05:21,410
- How can I greet them like this? - Are they coming out?

153
00:05:21,410 --> 00:05:23,194
Guests, please come on out.

154
00:05:23,619 --> 00:05:26,049
I think they invited guests So Min likes today.

155
00:05:26,049 --> 00:05:28,064
- I can't wait to find out. - Are you here?

156
00:05:28,189 --> 00:05:29,819
Guests, please come on out.

157
00:05:29,819 --> 00:05:31,520
- Are they coming out? - It's Ji Yeon.

158
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:34,059
- Lim Ji Yeon. It's been a while. - Hello.

159
00:05:34,059 --> 00:05:35,900
(Lim Ji Yeon, Park Jung Min, and Choi Yu Hwa)

160
00:05:35,900 --> 00:05:37,435
- Ji Yeon. - It's been a while.

161
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:38,629
(As soon as they enter,)

162
00:05:38,629 --> 00:05:41,504
(they are shocked.)

163
00:05:42,939 --> 00:05:45,144
(Here comes King Byeonseong. Move out of his way.)

164
00:05:45,699 --> 00:05:47,739
(They are shocked by his appearance.)

165
00:05:47,739 --> 00:05:48,840
They are shocked.

166
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:50,540
- This is the least I can do. - Ji Yeon.

167
00:05:50,540 --> 00:05:52,449
- It's been a while. - After all, it took two hours.

168
00:05:52,449 --> 00:05:54,179
(When a male guest, Jung Min, enters...)

169
00:05:54,179 --> 00:05:56,155
- Hello. Come this way. - It's been a while.

170
00:05:56,619 --> 00:05:58,425
- It's been a while, Ji Yeon. - Hello.

171
00:05:58,679 --> 00:06:00,749
- Ji Yeon. - Hello.

172
00:06:00,749 --> 00:06:03,090
- Hello, come this way. - Hello.

173
00:06:03,090 --> 00:06:04,819
- So Min, hurry up and say hi. - Please look at So Min.

174
00:06:04,819 --> 00:06:06,960
- Hello. - Ji Yeon.

175
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:08,989
- What's up with the makeup? - "What's up with the makeup?"

176
00:06:08,989 --> 00:06:10,259
- "What's up with the makeup?" - Why?

177
00:06:10,259 --> 00:06:11,905
Today's guests are an actor and actresses.

178
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:14,144
- So Min is a bit embarrassed. - Right.

179
00:06:14,330 --> 00:06:16,040
- Hello. - She heard you were coming.

180
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:18,074
She wanted to look especially pretty, so hence the makeup.

181
00:06:18,369 --> 00:06:21,270
- These three guests are joining us. - What about us?

182
00:06:21,270 --> 00:06:23,055
- We'll do the segment like this? - Yes, of course.

183
00:06:23,639 --> 00:06:26,249
Kwang Soo and the guests are back with "Tazza: One Eyed Jack".

184
00:06:26,249 --> 00:06:27,555
- It's the third one. - We have many actors and actresses.

185
00:06:27,949 --> 00:06:29,819
They are joining us today.

186
00:06:29,819 --> 00:06:32,790
By the way, I didn't see Kwang Soo in the trailer.

187
00:06:32,790 --> 00:06:33,949
- Is he in the movie? - I'm in the movie.

188
00:06:33,949 --> 00:06:35,694
- He's in the movie. - He is?

189
00:06:35,860 --> 00:06:37,889
- He has a small part. - I saw all three of you.

190
00:06:37,889 --> 00:06:39,330
But I didn't see him in the trailer.

191
00:06:39,330 --> 00:06:41,889
That's how secretive and important my role is.

192
00:06:41,889 --> 00:06:43,830
You got fooled once again.

193
00:06:43,830 --> 00:06:45,405
- From what I've heard, - I wasn't fooled.

194
00:06:45,460 --> 00:06:47,369
Kwang Soo is only making a cameo appearance.

195
00:06:47,369 --> 00:06:48,429
No, I'm not.

196
00:06:48,429 --> 00:06:50,574
- But he's promoting it with you. - No, no.

197
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:51,699
He wanted to join us, so we let him.

198
00:06:51,699 --> 00:06:53,514
- What are you talking about? - I knew it.

199
00:06:54,309 --> 00:06:55,809
You should just focus on your career.

200
00:06:55,809 --> 00:06:56,910
- Comedian? - What's my career?

201
00:06:56,910 --> 00:06:58,639
Focus on being a better comedian.

202
00:06:58,639 --> 00:07:00,379
(Not a movie actor)

203
00:07:00,379 --> 00:07:01,910
Join projects as a comedian.

204
00:07:01,910 --> 00:07:04,249
- What's the matter with him? - You're doing a good job.

205
00:07:04,249 --> 00:07:06,989
Shouldn't he stand in the middle? Since he's in the movie too?

206
00:07:06,989 --> 00:07:08,824
- No, no. Stand over there. - Stand there.

207
00:07:09,220 --> 00:07:11,235
- What's wrong with him? - Jae Seok.

208
00:07:11,759 --> 00:07:13,189
- You will stand there. - He hates seeing Kwang Soo.

209
00:07:13,189 --> 00:07:15,689
- Jung Min is joining us today too. - Yes.

210
00:07:15,689 --> 00:07:18,699
It's our first time having him on our show.

211
00:07:18,699 --> 00:07:20,170
Please introduce yourself.

212
00:07:20,170 --> 00:07:22,600
Hello, my name is Park Jung Min.

213
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:25,770
Kwang Soo and I worked on a movie called "Tazza: One Eyed Jack".

214
00:07:25,770 --> 00:07:27,670
Our movie is soon to be released, so I came here to have fun.

215
00:07:27,670 --> 00:07:29,685
(This is his first time on our show through an official invitation.)

216
00:07:30,110 --> 00:07:33,454
(A real blue chip with awe-inspiring acting performances)

217
00:07:34,110 --> 00:07:36,819
(He can perfectly pull off any types of roles.)

218
00:07:36,819 --> 00:07:40,119
(He's the genius actor whose acting spectrum is endless.)

219
00:07:40,119 --> 00:07:42,495
(Park Jung Min!)

220
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:45,989
Jung Min,

221
00:07:45,989 --> 00:07:48,530
you even published a book. You have a lot of talents, don't you?

222
00:07:48,530 --> 00:07:49,629
Right.

223
00:07:49,629 --> 00:07:51,030
He attended Korea University...

224
00:07:51,030 --> 00:07:52,400
- Stop it. - at first and transferred.

225
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:53,530
- Really? - Really?

226
00:07:53,530 --> 00:07:55,600
Don't you know the times we live in? Why bring up schools?

227
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:58,745
(Sharp advice)

228
00:07:59,739 --> 00:08:00,970
Why did you mention his school?

229
00:08:00,970 --> 00:08:02,509
- That wasn't my purpose. - Why did you mention that?

230
00:08:02,509 --> 00:08:04,410
- What did you major in? - At first...

231
00:08:04,410 --> 00:08:05,855
I was in liberal arts for a short time.

232
00:08:06,179 --> 00:08:07,309
You must've gotten good grades.

233
00:08:07,309 --> 00:08:08,410
- No. - Your grades must've been good.

234
00:08:08,410 --> 00:08:10,495
- He indeed has many talents. - He's versatile.

235
00:08:10,619 --> 00:08:12,549
In the movie, "Sunset in My Hometown",

236
00:08:12,549 --> 00:08:13,949
- He rapped in the movie. - he even rapped.

237
00:08:13,949 --> 00:08:15,020
- I saw it. - He rapped.

238
00:08:15,020 --> 00:08:17,394
- He asked us not to make him rap. - Of course.

239
00:08:17,619 --> 00:08:18,860
Rap for us.

240
00:08:18,860 --> 00:08:19,960
- No, no. - I'm awful.

241
00:08:19,960 --> 00:08:21,905
- Why not? - We were instructed not to ask.

242
00:08:22,460 --> 00:08:25,559
Until when will we follow orders from the guests?

243
00:08:25,559 --> 00:08:28,274
(King Byeonseong explodes.)

244
00:08:28,970 --> 00:08:30,170
- That's right. - We must get them to do things.

245
00:08:30,170 --> 00:08:31,499
- Seok Jin, don't be so angry. - He's so scary.

246
00:08:31,499 --> 00:08:32,814
I think he should rap.

247
00:08:32,939 --> 00:08:34,270
You should rap. Now.

248
00:08:34,270 --> 00:08:35,309
(King Byeonseong shows no mercy.)

249
00:08:35,309 --> 00:08:36,910
- Hurry. - Stop it.

250
00:08:36,910 --> 00:08:38,584
This is an order from King Byeonseong.

251
00:08:38,710 --> 00:08:39,980
- What's wrong with you? - Rap for us.

252
00:08:39,980 --> 00:08:41,480
- Why are you doing a skit? - What's wrong with you?

253
00:08:41,480 --> 00:08:43,980
- Until when will we let them? - You should show him.

254
00:08:43,980 --> 00:08:45,155
Listen up.

255
00:08:45,279 --> 00:08:46,519
- You're here, Jung Min - Stop it.

256
00:08:46,519 --> 00:08:48,994
(You're here, Jung Min)

257
00:08:50,019 --> 00:08:51,619
- Listen. - Why are you doing a skit now?

258
00:08:51,619 --> 00:08:53,529
- He was about to do it. - Why did you do that? Stop it.

259
00:08:53,529 --> 00:08:56,704
I want to take that from his head and twist his legs.

260
00:08:57,529 --> 00:08:59,730
- Rapping is the most embarrassing. - Exactly.

261
00:08:59,730 --> 00:09:02,104
Although he didn't rap, we discussed it for a long time.

262
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:04,814
It's because of Seok Jin.

263
00:09:04,840 --> 00:09:05,899
It's because of that clueless guy.

264
00:09:05,899 --> 00:09:08,610
Right. Jung Min just introduced himself.

265
00:09:08,610 --> 00:09:10,180
Why don't you go next?

266
00:09:10,180 --> 00:09:12,879
Hello, I'm Lim Ji Yeon. I'm Kwang Soo's partner...

267
00:09:12,879 --> 00:09:15,249
in the movie, "Tazza: One Eyed Jack".

268
00:09:15,249 --> 00:09:17,155
Ji Yeon, it's been a while.

269
00:09:17,619 --> 00:09:21,395
(Lim Ji Yeon, movie actress of refreshing candor)

270
00:09:21,950 --> 00:09:25,964
(An irresistible actress that dominated the movie screens)

271
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:27,830
Actually, as for Ji Yeon,

272
00:09:27,830 --> 00:09:29,629
- she's on the show several times. - Yes.

273
00:09:29,629 --> 00:09:31,330
- This is my 3rd time. - It's your 3rd time.

274
00:09:31,330 --> 00:09:32,769
- Really? - That's amazing.

275
00:09:32,769 --> 00:09:34,899
Since the last time, it's been about two years.

276
00:09:34,899 --> 00:09:36,769
- Right? It's been a while. - Yes, it's been a while.

277
00:09:36,769 --> 00:09:38,700
Jung Min and Ji Yeon went to the same college.

278
00:09:38,700 --> 00:09:39,710
Who and who?

279
00:09:39,710 --> 00:09:41,614
- Jung Min and Ji Yeon. - They attended the same college?

280
00:09:41,810 --> 00:09:43,009
- They went to the same college. - She went to Korea University too?

281
00:09:43,009 --> 00:09:44,480
- No. - I didn't go to Korea University.

282
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:46,480
Why were you shocked when you asked if she went to Korea University?

283
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:48,484
(I saw that.)

284
00:09:48,680 --> 00:09:50,324
Not Korea University. He transferred to another school.

285
00:09:50,450 --> 00:09:51,720
Why are you doing that to me?

286
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:52,850
"Why are you doing that to me?"

287
00:09:52,850 --> 00:09:54,665
Ji Yeon said, "Why are you doing that to me?"

288
00:09:55,850 --> 00:09:57,659
Have you worked on a project with So Min?

289
00:09:57,659 --> 00:09:59,730
- No. We just had drinks together. - So Min...

290
00:09:59,730 --> 00:10:01,690
- We just had drinks together. - Really?

291
00:10:01,690 --> 00:10:03,935
Ji Yeon, have you seen how So Min behaves when she gets drunk?

292
00:10:04,029 --> 00:10:06,574
- When she gets drunk, - Go on.

293
00:10:06,730 --> 00:10:08,430
she picks up a fight.

294
00:10:08,430 --> 00:10:11,074
(She's honest.)

295
00:10:12,070 --> 00:10:14,210
She picks a lot of fights. Her eyes...

296
00:10:14,210 --> 00:10:16,139
- That's the worst. - shoot a laser beam.

297
00:10:16,139 --> 00:10:17,379
- Right? - Why do you do that?

298
00:10:17,379 --> 00:10:19,354
Pretend you didn't hear her when she talks to you drunk.

299
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:21,149
- If you go along with that... - Once your eyes meet...

300
00:10:21,149 --> 00:10:22,580
What does she pick a fight about?

301
00:10:22,580 --> 00:10:24,450
A long time ago,

302
00:10:24,450 --> 00:10:27,464
So Min called me at night when I was working out.

303
00:10:27,749 --> 00:10:29,119
- I did? - Really?

304
00:10:29,119 --> 00:10:30,590
She told me that she was filming Running Man.

305
00:10:30,590 --> 00:10:31,989
- At night? - She was in the middle of a game.

306
00:10:31,989 --> 00:10:33,860
- She told me to come to her. - At night?

307
00:10:33,860 --> 00:10:35,659
- We don't film at night. - We don't film at night nowadays.

308
00:10:35,659 --> 00:10:37,629
It was past 9 p.m.

309
00:10:37,629 --> 00:10:39,629
I told her that I couldn't go. I was sweaty too.

310
00:10:39,629 --> 00:10:40,944
- Oh, no. - I told her I couldn't make it.

311
00:10:41,570 --> 00:10:43,669
- She kept calling me. - Why?

312
00:10:43,669 --> 00:10:45,739
- But she wasn't filming the show. - Kwang Soo made me call him.

313
00:10:45,739 --> 00:10:47,369
- Kwang Soo made me call him. - I'm sorry about that.

314
00:10:47,369 --> 00:10:48,869
- Se Chan... - Me? I wasn't there.

315
00:10:48,869 --> 00:10:50,340
No, you were with me then.

316
00:10:50,340 --> 00:10:52,415
- What are you talking about? - What?

317
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:53,610
Are you drunk? Are you all right?

318
00:10:53,610 --> 00:10:55,210
- You dropped the show's name? - No...

319
00:10:55,210 --> 00:10:57,279
- You used the show as an excuse. - Never. I never call when I drink.

320
00:10:57,279 --> 00:10:58,625
Hey, look at your face.

321
00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:01,094
Get a grip.

322
00:11:01,389 --> 00:11:02,419
(I'm glad that I have you.)

323
00:11:02,419 --> 00:11:04,460
- Get a grip. - My gosh, they were with me.

324
00:11:04,460 --> 00:11:05,889
They were with me when I made the call.

325
00:11:05,889 --> 00:11:07,334
- Why are you angry? - We were with you that night?

326
00:11:07,389 --> 00:11:08,629
We were drinking together then.

327
00:11:08,629 --> 00:11:10,405
- All of us. - What? That's not true.

328
00:11:10,430 --> 00:11:12,200
You look meaner with the makeup on.

329
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:13,769
(You look meaner with the Jigsaw makeup on.)

330
00:11:13,769 --> 00:11:14,869
You look meaner.

331
00:11:14,869 --> 00:11:16,915
Don't fix your hair. It's so weird.

332
00:11:17,940 --> 00:11:20,614
- You look so weird. - Don't do it. Why are you doing it?

333
00:11:21,139 --> 00:11:22,685
Why don't you introduce yourself next?

334
00:11:22,779 --> 00:11:25,484
Hello, my name is Choi Yu Hwa.

335
00:11:25,610 --> 00:11:26,854
Yu Hwa.

336
00:11:28,110 --> 00:11:29,980
(She became an actress after debuting as a model...)

337
00:11:29,980 --> 00:11:31,925
(at the age of 20 with her sole passion for acting.)

338
00:11:32,279 --> 00:11:35,450
(It's already been 10 years since her debut.)

339
00:11:35,450 --> 00:11:38,519
So Min has the nickname of Crazy Poet.

340
00:11:38,519 --> 00:11:39,560
She writes many emotional posts...

341
00:11:39,560 --> 00:11:40,860
- on her social media. - That's right.

342
00:11:40,860 --> 00:11:44,074
- Yu Hwa writes such posts too. - I see.

343
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:45,935
- Let's take a look. - Yes.

344
00:11:46,499 --> 00:11:48,704
Yu Hwa uploaded this post.

345
00:11:49,669 --> 00:11:51,769
"There are times when I look for a word..."

346
00:11:51,769 --> 00:11:53,769
"or a sentence to be hooked on."

347
00:11:53,769 --> 00:11:55,314
- She's pretty good. - Yes.

348
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:58,055
"I'm not ready to get snowed on yet."

349
00:11:58,480 --> 00:11:59,954
What's wrong with her?

350
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:03,094
(She's not ready to get snowed on yet!)

351
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:05,050
- She's not ready yet. - What was that?

352
00:12:05,050 --> 00:12:06,190
- What did she write? - Right.

353
00:12:06,190 --> 00:12:07,289
(That was too much.)

354
00:12:07,289 --> 00:12:08,450
- Yu Hwa. - Yes?

355
00:12:08,450 --> 00:12:09,690
- What does this mean? - What is it?

356
00:12:09,690 --> 00:12:11,360
- What on earth happened? - For posts like this,

357
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:13,529
our Crazy Poet should interpret the post.

358
00:12:13,529 --> 00:12:15,135
- Interpret it. - What is this about?

359
00:12:15,330 --> 00:12:16,830
- It has double meanings. - Like what?

360
00:12:16,830 --> 00:12:18,259
It could mean she's not ready to face the snow or...

361
00:12:18,259 --> 00:12:20,169
- to connect with someone else. - Is that correct?

362
00:12:20,169 --> 00:12:23,515
It means that she's not ready.

363
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:25,600
She's totally spot on.

364
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:26,844
She is?

365
00:12:27,009 --> 00:12:28,669
I guess crazy girls see eye to eye.

366
00:12:28,669 --> 00:12:30,915
(Feeling creeped out)

367
00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:32,954
I guess crazy people have their own language.

368
00:12:33,610 --> 00:12:35,279
Is there a club where crazy poets assemble?

369
00:12:35,279 --> 00:12:36,980
Seeing how she posted it on her social media,

370
00:12:36,980 --> 00:12:38,779
- it means she wants attention. - No.

371
00:12:38,779 --> 00:12:40,525
No, this is just creative writing.

372
00:12:40,820 --> 00:12:41,820
- With this... - I think...

373
00:12:41,820 --> 00:12:43,364
you might have forgotten how you look right now.

374
00:12:44,259 --> 00:12:46,665
- Should I show you a mirror? - Do you know how you look now?

375
00:12:46,690 --> 00:12:48,265
By the way, Yu Hwa...

376
00:12:48,330 --> 00:12:50,604
- is the same age as Kwang Soo. - Yes, we're the same age.

377
00:12:51,499 --> 00:12:54,029
- She looks she's younger than him. - She looks younger than her age.

378
00:12:54,029 --> 00:12:56,244
You're older than me. You were born in 1985?

379
00:12:56,340 --> 00:12:58,169
How old are you, Ji Yeon?

380
00:12:58,169 --> 00:13:00,070
I'm five years younger than her.

381
00:13:00,070 --> 00:13:01,244
She's older than you?

382
00:13:01,470 --> 00:13:03,009
(Exchanging eye contact)

383
00:13:03,009 --> 00:13:05,039
(Ji Yeon is 5 years younger than her?)

384
00:13:05,039 --> 00:13:08,084
Ji Yeon also looks younger than her age.

385
00:13:08,149 --> 00:13:09,350
But five years younger?

386
00:13:09,350 --> 00:13:11,525
(But five year younger?)

387
00:13:12,080 --> 00:13:13,389
- Why are you being so mean? - Ji Yeon.

388
00:13:13,389 --> 00:13:14,864
- Listen. - She's young.

389
00:13:15,149 --> 00:13:17,094
- That's meaner. - "Five years?"

390
00:13:17,119 --> 00:13:18,619
- Oh, my. - "Five years?"

391
00:13:18,619 --> 00:13:21,005
What are you talking about? Five years?

392
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:23,129
(Let's stop talking about age now.)

393
00:13:23,129 --> 00:13:25,300
- She looks younger than her age. - Yes, she does.

394
00:13:25,300 --> 00:13:26,970
- She looks really young. - I was so surprised.

395
00:13:26,970 --> 00:13:29,744
Today's race will be an individual match for all 11 of you.

396
00:13:30,039 --> 00:13:34,739
Today's race is called Deity of Games, Betrayed by Your Trust.

397
00:13:34,739 --> 00:13:36,285
Okay.

398
00:13:36,409 --> 00:13:38,954
Hey, he wasn't done.

399
00:13:39,340 --> 00:13:41,224
I think I've been quiet.

400
00:13:42,009 --> 00:13:44,279
You can accumulate R Coins through missions.

401
00:13:44,279 --> 00:13:47,364
The more coins you gather, the bigger benefits you'll have.

402
00:13:47,450 --> 00:13:49,395
Bring in the prizes and the board.

403
00:13:49,419 --> 00:13:51,234
- Prize? - There are prizes?

404
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:53,765
- Here they come. - Be careful.

405
00:13:54,060 --> 00:13:55,289
That's Korean beef set.

406
00:13:55,289 --> 00:13:57,029
(Awesome prizes from an LED mask to a Korean beef set)

407
00:13:57,029 --> 00:13:58,704
There's that prize.

408
00:13:59,570 --> 00:14:01,675
- What is it? - This is amazing.

409
00:14:01,700 --> 00:14:03,539
- Look at that. - I'll look like a hero.

410
00:14:03,539 --> 00:14:05,570
- You'll look like a hero? - My kids will love this.

411
00:14:05,570 --> 00:14:07,084
Haha loves gadgets like that.

412
00:14:07,239 --> 00:14:08,385
What's that?

413
00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:10,454
- You need to press this here. - Press it.

414
00:14:11,009 --> 00:14:12,110
It's working now.

415
00:14:12,110 --> 00:14:13,909
This is awesome. I can see right through this.

416
00:14:13,909 --> 00:14:16,249
This is amazing.

417
00:14:16,249 --> 00:14:18,379
This is really pretty.

418
00:14:18,379 --> 00:14:19,619
- This is "pretty"? - That's nice.

419
00:14:19,619 --> 00:14:21,594
I bet the kids will love it too.

420
00:14:21,850 --> 00:14:24,395
Stop it. Why would kids put this on?

421
00:14:24,619 --> 00:14:28,104
This is something the whole family can enjoy. This is amazing!

422
00:14:29,289 --> 00:14:31,875
Hey, that's not how you advertise a product!

423
00:14:33,300 --> 00:14:34,369
(A capitalist fool who can't advertise a product)

424
00:14:34,369 --> 00:14:35,974
- Advertisement? - They'll pull back the offer.

425
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:39,169
- Check the prizes and penalties. - What are the prizes?

426
00:14:39,169 --> 00:14:42,685
If you get more than 51 R Coins, you'll get the LED mask.

427
00:14:43,080 --> 00:14:45,180
With R Coins between 31 and 50, you'll get the Korean beef set.

428
00:14:45,180 --> 00:14:46,685
- I want the LED mask. - Between 11 and 31, it's a juicer.

429
00:14:46,810 --> 00:14:48,925
For R Coins between 0 to 10, you'll get a portable fan.

430
00:14:49,619 --> 00:14:50,779
- The makeup and the costume. - We have penalties.

431
00:14:50,779 --> 00:14:52,025
That again?

432
00:14:52,220 --> 00:14:53,820
- It's the opening disguise. - Our points will be accumulated.

433
00:14:53,820 --> 00:14:54,950
You better not get that one.

434
00:14:54,950 --> 00:14:57,619
If you do well, you'll receive the gifts.

435
00:14:57,619 --> 00:15:00,690
If you don't do well, you'll be penalized.

436
00:15:00,690 --> 00:15:02,230
- Let me continue. - There's more.

437
00:15:02,230 --> 00:15:03,830
There are two ways to acquire R Coins.

438
00:15:03,830 --> 00:15:06,060
There are many rules.

439
00:15:06,060 --> 00:15:08,145
You can either win games that have the coins at stake.

440
00:15:08,330 --> 00:15:09,800
You can also pick colored coins...

441
00:15:09,800 --> 00:15:11,314
during the Full House after the mission.

442
00:15:11,340 --> 00:15:13,739
According to the result, you'll be able to acquire the coins.

443
00:15:13,739 --> 00:15:16,785
There are blue, red, and black R Coins.

444
00:15:16,909 --> 00:15:19,655
You can each pick one.

445
00:15:20,210 --> 00:15:22,149
If everyone picks black,

446
00:15:22,149 --> 00:15:23,919
you each get 10 R Coins.

447
00:15:23,919 --> 00:15:26,489
If only one of you picks black,

448
00:15:26,489 --> 00:15:28,190
that individual will receive 20 R Coins.

449
00:15:28,190 --> 00:15:31,234
If there are two or more people who pick black,

450
00:15:31,389 --> 00:15:35,204
those who pick blue or red will receive five R Coins each.

451
00:15:35,430 --> 00:15:39,129
Those who pick black will have to give five R Coins.

452
00:15:39,129 --> 00:15:41,230
If no one picks black,

453
00:15:41,230 --> 00:15:43,669
those who pick the majority...

454
00:15:43,669 --> 00:15:45,970
will receive five R Coins each.

455
00:15:45,970 --> 00:15:48,470
After the final round, depending on the R Coins you have,

456
00:15:48,470 --> 00:15:51,015
you'll be either rewarded or penalized.

457
00:15:51,779 --> 00:15:53,210
(Current Number of R Coins)

458
00:15:53,210 --> 00:15:54,279
(They already played a mission beforehand.)

459
00:15:54,279 --> 00:15:55,480
What is this?

460
00:15:55,480 --> 00:15:56,854
What is this?

461
00:15:57,519 --> 00:15:59,249
- What is this? - What is this?

462
00:15:59,249 --> 00:16:00,824
It's like a karaoke.

463
00:16:01,419 --> 00:16:02,489
A karaoke?

464
00:16:02,489 --> 00:16:03,759
Let me explain.

465
00:16:03,759 --> 00:16:07,759
For this round, you'll be divided into teams of 3, 4, and 4.

466
00:16:07,759 --> 00:16:08,964
Team of 3, 4, and 4?

467
00:16:08,989 --> 00:16:11,830
This first mission is called Mic High Low.

468
00:16:11,830 --> 00:16:15,169
(Mic High Low)

469
00:16:15,169 --> 00:16:17,369
- High Low? - You'll be singing.

470
00:16:17,369 --> 00:16:19,710
The team with the highest score will win.

471
00:16:19,710 --> 00:16:22,909
But if both digits are the same number,

472
00:16:22,909 --> 00:16:24,440
that team will win.

473
00:16:24,440 --> 00:16:27,149
Instead of getting 93 points, you'll win with 77 points.

474
00:16:27,149 --> 00:16:28,354
(He gives an example.)

475
00:16:28,610 --> 00:16:30,519
In other words, it's called a "ddaeng".

476
00:16:30,519 --> 00:16:32,249
(In other words, it's called a "ddaeng".)

477
00:16:32,249 --> 00:16:33,425
"Ddaeng".

478
00:16:33,789 --> 00:16:35,119
(He uses a gambling term.)

479
00:16:35,119 --> 00:16:37,119
That's a gambling term.

480
00:16:37,119 --> 00:16:38,720
- "Ddaeng". - All right.

481
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:40,230
You'll win if you get a "ddaeng".

482
00:16:40,230 --> 00:16:41,259
You need the same number.

483
00:16:41,259 --> 00:16:42,860
What if you get 38 points?

484
00:16:42,860 --> 00:16:44,330
(It's the highest "ddaeng".)

485
00:16:44,330 --> 00:16:45,399
- It's a "gwangddaeng". - It's a "gwangddaeng".

486
00:16:45,399 --> 00:16:46,600
Does that work?

487
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:48,200
No, it doesn't count.

488
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:51,039
The amount of coins you'll receive will equal...

489
00:16:51,039 --> 00:16:52,800
the first digit of your score.

490
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:54,214
For example, if you get 93 points,

491
00:16:54,310 --> 00:16:56,169
you'll each receive nine coins.

492
00:16:56,169 --> 00:16:57,840
If you get a pair,

493
00:16:57,840 --> 00:17:00,379
the staff will reward you with the amount of the first digit.

494
00:17:00,379 --> 00:17:02,954
For the last digit, you may pick a member...

495
00:17:03,009 --> 00:17:04,779
- to receive that amount from. - Oh, no.

496
00:17:04,779 --> 00:17:05,854
We'll steal from them.

497
00:17:06,050 --> 00:17:07,590
Let's say you got 99 points.

498
00:17:07,590 --> 00:17:10,590
Then we'll reward each of you with nine coins.

499
00:17:10,590 --> 00:17:12,159
If you want to take the remaining nine coins from Kwang Soo,

500
00:17:12,159 --> 00:17:13,764
you can do that.

501
00:17:14,290 --> 00:17:15,929
Even your example involves Kwang Soo.

502
00:17:15,929 --> 00:17:17,399
(He's happy.)

503
00:17:17,399 --> 00:17:18,774
(He has nothing to say.)

504
00:17:19,300 --> 00:17:20,469
Because he has 10 coins.

505
00:17:20,469 --> 00:17:22,770
- We should pick him. - Seok Jin and I are in first place.

506
00:17:22,770 --> 00:17:24,244
- You're right. - We should target them.

507
00:17:24,639 --> 00:17:26,810
Each team will get to sing once.

508
00:17:26,810 --> 00:17:29,310
We'll start in five minutes.

509
00:17:29,310 --> 00:17:31,280
The remaining two teams...

510
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:33,510
will hide for five minutes.

511
00:17:33,510 --> 00:17:35,750
(They will hide before the song begins.)

512
00:17:35,750 --> 00:17:38,449
- And? - You're allowed to hide anywhere.

513
00:17:38,449 --> 00:17:39,754
This is hide-and-seek.

514
00:17:40,889 --> 00:17:42,189
Where could we hide?

515
00:17:42,189 --> 00:17:45,419
Two members from the singing team have to find the members in hiding.

516
00:17:45,419 --> 00:17:47,429
They must touch and eliminate them.

517
00:17:47,429 --> 00:17:48,830
Every time they eliminate a member,

518
00:17:48,830 --> 00:17:51,500
the microphone will come down.

519
00:17:51,500 --> 00:17:54,875
(The microphone will come lower.)

520
00:17:55,270 --> 00:17:56,540
The team members will matter.

521
00:17:56,540 --> 00:17:59,300
It's best to pick people who are good at singing or hiding.

522
00:17:59,300 --> 00:18:01,185
(The guests will play rock-paper-scissors.)

523
00:18:01,209 --> 00:18:02,810
Those who are good at singing or hiding?

524
00:18:02,810 --> 00:18:05,040
- Rock-paper-scissors - Rock-paper-scissors

525
00:18:05,040 --> 00:18:07,080
(Ji Yeon wins.)

526
00:18:07,080 --> 00:18:08,080
Yes.

527
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:09,610
- Rock-paper-scissors - Kwang Soo.

528
00:18:09,610 --> 00:18:11,325
(You lose, Kwang Soo.)

529
00:18:13,189 --> 00:18:15,189
- Kwang Soo, come this way. - Come.

530
00:18:15,189 --> 00:18:16,290
Who won?

531
00:18:16,290 --> 00:18:17,635
- She did. - You did?

532
00:18:17,820 --> 00:18:19,020
Ji Hyo.

533
00:18:19,020 --> 00:18:22,189
(Yu Hwa picks Ji Hyo.)

534
00:18:22,189 --> 00:18:24,360
She's neither good at hiding nor singing.

535
00:18:24,360 --> 00:18:27,345
(Jong Kook states a fact.)

536
00:18:27,729 --> 00:18:28,929
She needs to be good at singing.

537
00:18:28,929 --> 00:18:31,274
- I'm sure I'm good at one of them. - You don't get the rules, do you?

538
00:18:31,869 --> 00:18:33,385
You've failed already.

539
00:18:33,570 --> 00:18:34,570
(Team Members)

540
00:18:34,570 --> 00:18:37,185
- Have you picked your team members? - Yes.

541
00:18:37,310 --> 00:18:39,510
Team Red will go first.

542
00:18:39,510 --> 00:18:42,524
- Please wear these eye masks. - Okay.

543
00:18:42,550 --> 00:18:44,355
We need to hide well.

544
00:18:44,619 --> 00:18:45,619
(Where should I hide?)

545
00:18:45,619 --> 00:18:47,320
If they spot us but haven't touched us,

546
00:18:47,320 --> 00:18:48,490
we're not out, right?

547
00:18:48,490 --> 00:18:50,689
- Right. - I'll make sure I do.

548
00:18:50,689 --> 00:18:52,994
(I'll make sure I do.)

549
00:18:53,689 --> 00:18:56,335
- If it's you... - I can do it.

550
00:18:56,360 --> 00:18:58,860
Please pick two members who will sing...

551
00:18:58,860 --> 00:19:00,469
and two members who will eliminate the others.

552
00:19:00,469 --> 00:19:02,544
We'll eliminate the others, and they'll sing.

553
00:19:02,729 --> 00:19:03,800
We'll eliminate them.

554
00:19:03,800 --> 00:19:05,340
You two can sing.

555
00:19:05,340 --> 00:19:06,540
Get ready.

556
00:19:06,540 --> 00:19:07,744
Get ready.

557
00:19:07,909 --> 00:19:08,969
(It's 5 minutes before the search team goes out.)

558
00:19:08,969 --> 00:19:10,010
Set.

559
00:19:10,010 --> 00:19:11,179
(It's 5 minutes before the search team goes out.)

560
00:19:11,179 --> 00:19:13,214
(The other two teams begin hiding.)

561
00:19:14,110 --> 00:19:15,550
(They need to hide before Team Red begins singing.)

562
00:19:15,550 --> 00:19:16,750
Can they not see for sure?

563
00:19:16,750 --> 00:19:18,395
(They need to hide before Team Red begins singing.)

564
00:19:19,250 --> 00:19:21,694
(Hesitating)

565
00:19:22,290 --> 00:19:23,919
There aren't that many places to hide.

566
00:19:23,919 --> 00:19:25,335
You're right.

567
00:19:25,590 --> 00:19:28,459
I bet there's someone hiding among the staff.

568
00:19:28,459 --> 00:19:30,304
(His sixth sense is at work.)

569
00:19:31,159 --> 00:19:32,459
I bet.

570
00:19:32,459 --> 00:19:33,629
I'm certain.

571
00:19:33,629 --> 00:19:35,375
They probably changed into a staff member's clothes.

572
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:38,744
They're probably holding onto a camera.

573
00:19:40,209 --> 00:19:42,514
(She runs away.)

574
00:19:43,310 --> 00:19:44,580
- Where should I hide? - Ji Yeon.

575
00:19:44,580 --> 00:19:45,979
Hurry up and hide.

576
00:19:45,979 --> 00:19:47,224
(Hurrying)

577
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:49,825
Let me go behind.

578
00:19:50,250 --> 00:19:51,925
(They probably won't find me here.)

579
00:19:54,689 --> 00:19:56,095
My neck hurts.

580
00:19:57,119 --> 00:19:59,034
Right now, 2 minutes and 30 seconds have passed.

581
00:19:59,659 --> 00:20:00,760
How much?

582
00:20:00,760 --> 00:20:02,689
(They don't know where to hide.)

583
00:20:02,689 --> 00:20:03,875
By the way...

584
00:20:04,729 --> 00:20:06,234
Can you raise me up?

585
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:08,300
Can you raise me up?

586
00:20:08,300 --> 00:20:10,000
(Kwang Soo attempts to go on top of the mattresses.)

587
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,115
1, 2, 3.

588
00:20:12,699 --> 00:20:14,570
Raise me up. 1, 2, 3.

589
00:20:14,570 --> 00:20:16,010
More, more.

590
00:20:16,010 --> 00:20:17,610
You can do it. When did you become so weak?

591
00:20:17,610 --> 00:20:19,409
Step on me.

592
00:20:19,409 --> 00:20:21,754
- Here. Step on me. - Step on you?

593
00:20:21,979 --> 00:20:23,619
(Pressing)

594
00:20:23,619 --> 00:20:24,694
Go up!

595
00:20:25,050 --> 00:20:26,625
- Go up! - Endure it.

596
00:20:27,290 --> 00:20:28,619
- What are you doing? - Help me up.

597
00:20:28,619 --> 00:20:30,189
- Hurry. - Go.

598
00:20:30,189 --> 00:20:31,565
- Goodness. - Hurry!

599
00:20:32,459 --> 00:20:33,964
They won't be able to touch me.

600
00:20:35,060 --> 00:20:37,199
(He successfully goes on top of the mattresses.)

601
00:20:37,199 --> 00:20:38,530
(They won't see me up here.)

602
00:20:38,530 --> 00:20:40,570
Can you see me? No, right?

603
00:20:40,570 --> 00:20:43,204
You have a minute left.

604
00:20:43,570 --> 00:20:44,915
How much?

605
00:20:45,369 --> 00:20:47,345
There's a lot of electromagnetic waves in here.

606
00:20:49,139 --> 00:20:50,340
I'm going to lie down here.

607
00:20:50,340 --> 00:20:51,554
(He goes behind it.)

608
00:20:52,810 --> 00:20:55,080
(I'll hide here.)

609
00:20:55,080 --> 00:20:59,719
5, 4, 3, 2, 1.

610
00:20:59,719 --> 00:21:00,990
Time's over.

611
00:21:00,990 --> 00:21:02,619
(Their time is up.)

612
00:21:02,619 --> 00:21:06,219
You can take off your eye masks. We'll start once you pick your song.

613
00:21:06,219 --> 00:21:07,530
We'll sing "Tatata" by Kim Kook Hwan.

614
00:21:07,530 --> 00:21:08,865
"Tatata".

615
00:21:08,929 --> 00:21:10,959
Do we need to sing to that?

616
00:21:10,959 --> 00:21:12,060
(They need to sing to the mic on the ceiling.)

617
00:21:12,060 --> 00:21:13,229
Here it starts.

618
00:21:13,229 --> 00:21:14,229
(How will Team Red manage?)

619
00:21:14,229 --> 00:21:15,474
Jung Min.

620
00:21:16,399 --> 00:21:17,915
- Go, go, go. - Jung Min.

621
00:21:18,399 --> 00:21:19,469
(We'll sing our hearts out.)

622
00:21:19,469 --> 00:21:21,145
This will come down once they eliminate the others.

623
00:21:21,610 --> 00:21:23,169
(You don't know me)

624
00:21:23,169 --> 00:21:24,510
He has a loud voice.

625
00:21:24,510 --> 00:21:26,179
(You don't know me)

626
00:21:26,179 --> 00:21:27,885
He has a loud voice.

627
00:21:27,909 --> 00:21:30,449
(Screaming)

628
00:21:30,449 --> 00:21:31,655
(Giggling)

629
00:21:33,490 --> 00:21:36,250
(She can't believe she's singing a duet with him.)

630
00:21:36,250 --> 00:21:40,534
(This is a love duet for her.)

631
00:21:41,159 --> 00:21:43,290
(There's no harmony.)

632
00:21:43,290 --> 00:21:46,560
(She forgets about their search team.)

633
00:21:46,560 --> 00:21:49,244
(This is very nice.)

634
00:21:50,469 --> 00:21:55,444
(While the two are singing, the search team is...)

635
00:21:58,679 --> 00:22:00,224
(Let's see.)

636
00:22:04,149 --> 00:22:05,350
(He touches him.)

637
00:22:05,350 --> 00:22:06,520
What was that?

638
00:22:06,520 --> 00:22:07,889
(Se Chan was hiding under the sheets.)

639
00:22:07,889 --> 00:22:09,419
(Jong Kook eliminates him.)

640
00:22:09,419 --> 00:22:10,520
I'm out already?

641
00:22:10,520 --> 00:22:12,395
I eliminated one!

642
00:22:13,530 --> 00:22:15,129
(Thanks to Jong Kook,)

643
00:22:15,129 --> 00:22:17,734
(the microphone comes down.)

644
00:22:18,659 --> 00:22:19,959
Can you lift me up?

645
00:22:19,959 --> 00:22:21,030
(Of course)

646
00:22:21,030 --> 00:22:22,530
Can you lift me up?

647
00:22:22,530 --> 00:22:24,899
(So Min, get on top.)

648
00:22:24,899 --> 00:22:26,439
Just give me a piggyback ride.

649
00:22:26,439 --> 00:22:27,639
No, just get on my shoulders.

650
00:22:27,639 --> 00:22:28,810
Really?

651
00:22:28,810 --> 00:22:30,409
- I'm heavy. - It's okay.

652
00:22:30,409 --> 00:22:31,709
- I'm really heavy. - Here I go.

653
00:22:31,709 --> 00:22:32,740
Hold on!

654
00:22:32,740 --> 00:22:34,080
Hold on!

655
00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:35,179
Here I go.

656
00:22:35,179 --> 00:22:37,395
(This is a movie about a young couple.)

657
00:22:37,550 --> 00:22:38,750
Sing!

658
00:22:38,750 --> 00:22:39,879
Sing!

659
00:22:39,879 --> 00:22:41,550
(She chokes him.)

660
00:22:41,550 --> 00:22:42,794
Hold on.

661
00:22:43,189 --> 00:22:44,389
(It turns into a wrestling match.)

662
00:22:44,389 --> 00:22:46,565
I'm sorry.

663
00:22:46,590 --> 00:22:48,565
- I was too heavy. - Did they catch one person?

664
00:22:49,290 --> 00:22:52,229
(Meanwhile, Jong Kook, who looks like a pro wrestler, is searching.)

665
00:22:52,229 --> 00:22:54,774
(Where are you all hiding?)

666
00:22:58,369 --> 00:22:59,869
How are they hidden so well?

667
00:22:59,869 --> 00:23:01,744
(Be quiet. Look over there.)

668
00:23:10,379 --> 00:23:12,054
(Peeking)

669
00:23:15,290 --> 00:23:17,189
(I will now begin the hunt.)

670
00:23:17,189 --> 00:23:19,135
Haha, she's going that way.

671
00:23:19,389 --> 00:23:21,464
(She tries to escape.)

672
00:23:21,929 --> 00:23:23,189
- Which way? - She's going.

673
00:23:23,189 --> 00:23:24,500
- It's Ji Yeon. - Where?

674
00:23:24,500 --> 00:23:26,274
Come here. We need to stop her.

675
00:23:26,560 --> 00:23:28,300
(They corner her.)

676
00:23:28,300 --> 00:23:29,969
(Jong Kook eliminates her.)

677
00:23:29,969 --> 00:23:31,439
- She's out. - Done. Are you okay?

678
00:23:31,439 --> 00:23:33,340
(Ji Yeon is out.)

679
00:23:33,340 --> 00:23:34,444
Done. Are you okay?

680
00:23:34,840 --> 00:23:36,469
- Hold on. - Are you okay?

681
00:23:36,469 --> 00:23:39,709
(After eliminating her, they continue their search.)

682
00:23:39,709 --> 00:23:40,850
Come out.

683
00:23:40,850 --> 00:23:42,585
(Let's see.)

684
00:23:42,879 --> 00:23:43,919
(Screaming)

685
00:23:43,919 --> 00:23:46,054
Come out. I caught him.

686
00:23:46,550 --> 00:23:47,649
He's eliminated.

687
00:23:47,649 --> 00:23:48,649
(I'm out.)

688
00:23:48,649 --> 00:23:50,194
(Is anyone else in here?)

689
00:23:50,959 --> 00:23:52,665
(The song is nearing the end.)

690
00:23:53,389 --> 00:23:54,665
(Singing)

691
00:23:55,090 --> 00:23:56,464
(Singing)

692
00:23:57,800 --> 00:23:59,875
What are they doing?

693
00:24:00,429 --> 00:24:01,575
What are you doing?

694
00:24:01,669 --> 00:24:02,699
No way.

695
00:24:02,699 --> 00:24:04,474
Let's hope that we get a pair.

696
00:24:04,500 --> 00:24:06,474
Right, we should hope for that.

697
00:24:08,010 --> 00:24:09,040
That's the worst score ever.

698
00:24:09,040 --> 00:24:11,155
(They're ruined.)

699
00:24:12,179 --> 00:24:13,415
It's the worst. You're done for.

700
00:24:14,780 --> 00:24:16,185
- They're done? - It's over?

701
00:24:16,850 --> 00:24:18,979
(Where are the rest?)

702
00:24:18,979 --> 00:24:20,524
Gosh, you startled me.

703
00:24:20,919 --> 00:24:22,825
(Peekaboo)

704
00:24:23,520 --> 00:24:24,590
(You were there?)

705
00:24:24,590 --> 00:24:26,764
- I was so startled. - He was there.

706
00:24:27,030 --> 00:24:28,665
I barely managed to survive.

707
00:24:29,459 --> 00:24:30,760
You weren't eliminated, right?

708
00:24:30,760 --> 00:24:32,060
No.

709
00:24:32,060 --> 00:24:33,335
I wasn't.

710
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:37,415
Your score is...

711
00:24:37,469 --> 00:24:38,845
28 points.

712
00:24:39,570 --> 00:24:41,944
(It's a very low score.)

713
00:24:42,139 --> 00:24:43,639
- They just caught two. - They sang?

714
00:24:43,639 --> 00:24:44,984
Good work.

715
00:24:45,179 --> 00:24:46,840
We wasted so much time over there.

716
00:24:46,840 --> 00:24:47,879
We did.

717
00:24:47,879 --> 00:24:49,754
All right, next team, please.

718
00:24:50,010 --> 00:24:51,919
They caught me hiding under the sheets.

719
00:24:51,919 --> 00:24:53,790
So who should sing? How about Ji Yeon?

720
00:24:53,790 --> 00:24:55,590
- Ji Yeon, go ahead. - Shouldn't it be Kwang Soo?

721
00:24:55,590 --> 00:24:57,689
- No, because... - The others need...

722
00:24:57,689 --> 00:24:59,189
to catch those running away.

723
00:24:59,189 --> 00:25:01,560
More than anything though, I want to hear you sing.

724
00:25:01,560 --> 00:25:02,729
(Straightforward)

725
00:25:02,729 --> 00:25:03,959
(Me?)

726
00:25:03,959 --> 00:25:05,300
That's the biggest reason.

727
00:25:05,300 --> 00:25:07,199
We should hear the guests sing.

728
00:25:07,199 --> 00:25:08,199
Ji Yeon, come on.

729
00:25:08,199 --> 00:25:10,439
Then I'll sing "Love Battery".

730
00:25:10,439 --> 00:25:11,740
- That's a good one. - It's upbeat.

731
00:25:11,740 --> 00:25:12,740
I like her choice.

732
00:25:12,740 --> 00:25:15,570
- Charge me with love - It starts when the masks are on.

733
00:25:15,570 --> 00:25:17,979
Ready, set...

734
00:25:17,979 --> 00:25:19,514
(What will be the result?)

735
00:25:21,550 --> 00:25:22,724
Where do I hide?

736
00:25:23,379 --> 00:25:24,494
It's Se Chan.

737
00:25:25,649 --> 00:25:27,794
(I'm good at guessing.)

738
00:25:28,050 --> 00:25:30,959
- At least one went this way. - Right.

739
00:25:30,959 --> 00:25:33,365
- Some went behind us. - Exactly.

740
00:25:34,990 --> 00:25:36,065
(A single blow)

741
00:25:36,689 --> 00:25:37,774
(Thump!)

742
00:25:37,899 --> 00:25:38,929
It's Haha.

743
00:25:38,929 --> 00:25:40,845
(His second guess)

744
00:25:41,469 --> 00:25:43,274
(So where should I hide?)

745
00:25:44,169 --> 00:25:45,969
Everyone here ended up getting caught.

746
00:25:45,969 --> 00:25:47,169
Let's just hide though.

747
00:25:47,169 --> 00:25:50,355
Getting caught isn't the issue. Not getting touched is the key.

748
00:25:51,080 --> 00:25:53,179
(Meanwhile, Yu Hwa is in the closest waiting room.)

749
00:25:53,179 --> 00:25:55,655
(She decides on the classic move.)

750
00:25:56,479 --> 00:25:58,179
Kwang Soo, you run the other way.

751
00:25:58,179 --> 00:25:59,754
I'll run to the end first.

752
00:25:59,919 --> 00:26:01,895
- Take a look around as you go. - Sure.

753
00:26:03,590 --> 00:26:05,719
You have another 30 seconds.

754
00:26:05,719 --> 00:26:07,790
(What?)

755
00:26:07,790 --> 00:26:10,804
(Laughing)

756
00:26:11,659 --> 00:26:14,600
(Haha kept thinking of a place to hide.)

757
00:26:14,600 --> 00:26:16,544
(Can I borrow your shirt?)

758
00:26:17,270 --> 00:26:20,014
(He transforms right in front of them.)

759
00:26:20,709 --> 00:26:22,469
(They won't know, right?)

760
00:26:22,469 --> 00:26:26,209
(And so he transforms into the show's main writer.)

761
00:26:26,209 --> 00:26:27,954
(The beacon does not shine on its own base.)

762
00:26:28,510 --> 00:26:29,784
(Prim)

763
00:26:29,850 --> 00:26:34,865
5, 4, 3, 2, 1.

764
00:26:35,090 --> 00:26:36,524
(The search begins.)

765
00:26:38,919 --> 00:26:41,360
(Did Kwang Soo already spot Haha?)

766
00:26:41,360 --> 00:26:43,304
(What's that?)

767
00:26:44,560 --> 00:26:45,659
It's taking longer than I expected.

768
00:26:45,659 --> 00:26:47,204
You can run once the song begins.

769
00:26:48,199 --> 00:26:49,869
(Who says he has good hunches?)

770
00:26:49,869 --> 00:26:51,199
How do I get up there?

771
00:26:51,199 --> 00:26:52,570
(Ji Yeon thinks of using her surroundings.)

772
00:26:52,570 --> 00:26:54,484
- Ji Yeon, sing it well. - Sure.

773
00:26:54,570 --> 00:26:56,639
(Hold on!)

774
00:26:56,639 --> 00:27:00,185
(Kwang Soo suddenly heads to the waiting room.)

775
00:27:03,179 --> 00:27:06,350
(He guesses that someone's in here.)

776
00:27:06,350 --> 00:27:08,990
(Yu Hwa is right behind the door.)

777
00:27:08,990 --> 00:27:13,659
(Will Kwang Soo be able to tell that she's there?)

778
00:27:13,659 --> 00:27:14,764
(Swoosh)

779
00:27:15,389 --> 00:27:18,075
(There's no one here. I'm out!)

780
00:27:18,600 --> 00:27:19,959
(She now begins to sing.)

781
00:27:19,959 --> 00:27:23,544
Charge me with love

782
00:27:23,800 --> 00:27:25,875
(At the top of her lungs)

783
00:27:27,540 --> 00:27:28,840
(Bouncing)

784
00:27:28,840 --> 00:27:31,014
(They probably won't find me.)

785
00:27:31,080 --> 00:27:32,179
I can't live without you

786
00:27:32,179 --> 00:27:34,625
(She's in bed with the enemy.)

787
00:27:35,479 --> 00:27:37,754
(She keeps singing without realizing anything.)

788
00:27:38,750 --> 00:27:41,949
(Meanwhile, the perceptive Kwang Soo...)

789
00:27:41,949 --> 00:27:43,165
There's no one here.

790
00:27:46,889 --> 00:27:48,034
What?

791
00:27:48,929 --> 00:27:50,760
(What startled him like that?)

792
00:27:50,760 --> 00:27:53,435
(It's Jong Kook who's way up there.)

793
00:27:54,300 --> 00:27:55,474
There's no one here.

794
00:27:56,699 --> 00:27:58,815
(He pretends to not have seen anything.)

795
00:27:59,639 --> 00:28:01,685
Is this really necessary?

796
00:28:02,010 --> 00:28:03,340
Why...

797
00:28:03,340 --> 00:28:04,885
How on earth did he get up there?

798
00:28:06,110 --> 00:28:08,080
(When the others went into hiding,)

799
00:28:08,080 --> 00:28:11,080
(Jong Kook chose to go somewhere where he'd be unreachable.)

800
00:28:11,080 --> 00:28:13,254
(He's on top of a wall.)

801
00:28:14,850 --> 00:28:16,449
(Catch me if you can.)

802
00:28:16,449 --> 00:28:18,135
You just can't help yourself.

803
00:28:18,760 --> 00:28:21,565
(Kwang Soo pretends not to have seen Jong Kook.)

804
00:28:22,490 --> 00:28:26,300
(Meanwhile, Jae Seok is where Yu Hwa is hiding.)

805
00:28:26,300 --> 00:28:28,175
(Where is everyone?)

806
00:28:28,369 --> 00:28:29,675
Is there no other exit?

807
00:28:30,939 --> 00:28:33,915
(Swish)

808
00:28:34,409 --> 00:28:36,010
(Screaming)

809
00:28:36,010 --> 00:28:37,840
What are you doing here, Yu Hwa?

810
00:28:37,840 --> 00:28:38,954
Yu Hwa's out.

811
00:28:40,280 --> 00:28:42,709
- There's someone here. - Where?

812
00:28:42,709 --> 00:28:43,750
(Jae Seok continues...)

813
00:28:43,750 --> 00:28:45,425
(to find another victim.)

814
00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:47,794
It's Seok Jin.

815
00:28:48,490 --> 00:28:49,625
Seok Jin's out.

816
00:28:50,490 --> 00:28:52,895
Still, I managed to stay hidden for quite a while.

817
00:28:53,490 --> 00:28:56,365
(The microphone has come down quite a bit.)

818
00:28:57,929 --> 00:28:59,474
(They're good at finding people.)

819
00:29:01,229 --> 00:29:04,315
(They won't find me though.)

820
00:29:05,439 --> 00:29:07,169
(The song is now almost at the end.)

821
00:29:07,169 --> 00:29:10,270
- There's no one here. - If I'm by your side

822
00:29:10,270 --> 00:29:11,415
Were you caught?

823
00:29:11,516 --> 00:29:15,116
<font color="#fcc89b">[VIU Ver] SBS E465 Running Man</font>

00:29:15,280 --> 00:29:16,385
(What?)

825
00:29:17,750 --> 00:29:19,294
(Gosh, I'm caught.)

826
00:29:20,449 --> 00:29:23,490
- There's someone outside! - The song is almost over.

827
00:29:23,490 --> 00:29:24,990
(Hurry!)

828
00:29:24,990 --> 00:29:26,860
- Hurry up. - He's out there.

829
00:29:26,860 --> 00:29:28,264
(The top agent is coming for you.)

830
00:29:29,090 --> 00:29:30,600
(Jung Min, just you wait.)

831
00:29:30,600 --> 00:29:31,774
Jae Seok!

832
00:29:32,229 --> 00:29:33,635
(The song is over.)

833
00:29:33,929 --> 00:29:35,229
- It's over. - Unbelievable.

834
00:29:35,229 --> 00:29:37,675
- The song's over. - Unbelievable.

835
00:29:37,899 --> 00:29:39,544
This isn't how the game is supposed to go!

836
00:29:40,399 --> 00:29:42,169
- What's her score? - How did she do?

837
00:29:42,169 --> 00:29:43,169
(The song is over. What's here score?)

838
00:29:43,169 --> 00:29:48,379
(It must be higher than 43 or have two same numbers.)

839
00:29:48,379 --> 00:29:49,585
Don't let it be a pair.

840
00:29:49,780 --> 00:29:50,780
- What? - It's only 22.

841
00:29:50,780 --> 00:29:52,054
It's 2 and 2!

842
00:29:52,080 --> 00:29:54,219
(They scores a pair.)

843
00:29:54,219 --> 00:29:56,719
- It's a pair! - It's 2 and 2!

844
00:29:56,719 --> 00:29:57,889
I can't believe it.

845
00:29:57,889 --> 00:30:00,234
- Ji Yeon. - It's a pair of two.

846
00:30:01,560 --> 00:30:02,729
They scored a pair.

847
00:30:02,729 --> 00:30:03,835
(No way...)

848
00:30:04,899 --> 00:30:06,760
- Is it a pair? - Yes, we scored 22.

849
00:30:06,760 --> 00:30:09,229
- Okay! - Our score is 22.

850
00:30:09,229 --> 00:30:10,939
(A pair can nullify poor searching and singing.)

851
00:30:10,939 --> 00:30:13,800
The song is over, so ask everyone here.

852
00:30:13,800 --> 00:30:16,939
- It'll be a while for Jong Kook. - Do you know where Jong Kook was?

853
00:30:16,939 --> 00:30:19,379
He was close to the ceiling.

854
00:30:19,379 --> 00:30:21,754
It's as if he was way up there.

855
00:30:22,179 --> 00:30:24,095
How are we supposed to catch him up there?

856
00:30:24,679 --> 00:30:25,979
(Just thinking about it makes him angry.)

857
00:30:25,979 --> 00:30:27,790
What on earth is wrong with him?

858
00:30:27,790 --> 00:30:29,494
You can see him, but you can't touch him.

859
00:30:29,820 --> 00:30:31,790
Isn't it great to be on the same team with him?

860
00:30:31,790 --> 00:30:33,534
Yes, it's not bad.

861
00:30:33,590 --> 00:30:35,290
- Jong Kook's here. - What was your score?

862
00:30:35,290 --> 00:30:37,189
- They scored 22. - Really?

863
00:30:37,189 --> 00:30:38,899
Really? They scored a pair?

864
00:30:38,899 --> 00:30:41,300
- It worked out. - But they only had three members.

865
00:30:41,300 --> 00:30:45,639
So only Haha seems to still be missing. Haha?

866
00:30:45,639 --> 00:30:46,770
(Standing up)

867
00:30:46,770 --> 00:30:48,714
Did you say 22?

868
00:30:49,639 --> 00:30:50,810
Wasn't it Mi Yeon?

869
00:30:50,810 --> 00:30:52,054
22 points?

870
00:30:52,810 --> 00:30:54,185
Was your score 22?

871
00:30:54,750 --> 00:30:55,909
I thought it was Mi Yeon!

872
00:30:55,909 --> 00:30:58,219
- 22 points? - No way.

873
00:30:58,219 --> 00:30:59,919
Gosh, I really didn't know.

874
00:30:59,919 --> 00:31:02,449
I was sitting here the entire time.

875
00:31:02,449 --> 00:31:04,565
I really thought it was our writer.

876
00:31:04,820 --> 00:31:05,990
No way.

877
00:31:05,990 --> 00:31:09,304
You will receive two R Coins each.

878
00:31:09,389 --> 00:31:13,030
Also, you can take two coins from any person you want.

879
00:31:13,030 --> 00:31:14,300
(Since they received a pair, they can steal 2 coins each.)

880
00:31:14,300 --> 00:31:15,469
- Two each? - Yes.

881
00:31:15,469 --> 00:31:17,270
I'll take two from Seok Jin.

882
00:31:17,270 --> 00:31:18,944
(He didn't even hesitate.)

883
00:31:19,340 --> 00:31:21,014
- Seriously? - Then...

884
00:31:21,570 --> 00:31:23,070
- I'll take Se Chan's. - What if...

885
00:31:23,070 --> 00:31:25,540
Mine? Okay, fine.

886
00:31:25,540 --> 00:31:27,850
Kwang Soo, who would you take the coins from?

887
00:31:27,850 --> 00:31:30,580
I'll take Jong Kook's.

888
00:31:30,580 --> 00:31:33,020
- You fool, I don't have any. - Then you'll have minus two coins.

889
00:31:33,020 --> 00:31:34,490
- Really? - Yes.

890
00:31:34,490 --> 00:31:36,665
(Jong Kook now has minus 2 coins.)

891
00:31:37,760 --> 00:31:39,790
(Kwang Soo got the best of him.)

892
00:31:39,790 --> 00:31:41,165
(He's trying to hold back a smile.)

893
00:31:41,490 --> 00:31:43,459
I see you were quite annoyed with me.

894
00:31:43,459 --> 00:31:45,004
(Earlier...)

895
00:31:46,459 --> 00:31:48,544
Yes, I just couldn't let you get away with it.

896
00:31:48,969 --> 00:31:50,229
So you were pretty annoyed.

897
00:31:50,229 --> 00:31:51,770
Okay.

898
00:31:51,770 --> 00:31:53,369
So everything's been sorted out.

899
00:31:53,369 --> 00:31:56,810
Now it's time for Full House where extra coins can be won.

900
00:31:56,810 --> 00:31:58,554
- Full House? - Full House.

901
00:31:58,639 --> 00:31:59,915
Full House.

902
00:32:00,580 --> 00:32:01,679
We'll start with Team Red...

903
00:32:01,679 --> 00:32:03,909
who scored the lowest in the previous round.

904
00:32:03,909 --> 00:32:07,490
You will head over to the Full House and each choose a coin.

905
00:32:07,490 --> 00:32:10,860
If none chooses black and you either choose red or blue,

906
00:32:10,860 --> 00:32:13,389
those who chose the majority color will receive five coins.

907
00:32:13,389 --> 00:32:16,360
If you all choose the black coin, you'll receive 10 coins each.

908
00:32:16,360 --> 00:32:18,804
But what if all three coins were chosen?

909
00:32:18,899 --> 00:32:21,469
If more than two people choose the black coin...

910
00:32:21,469 --> 00:32:23,699
- The odds are low. - Those who chose black...

911
00:32:23,699 --> 00:32:26,014
will be robbed of 5 coins while the others receive 5.

912
00:32:26,540 --> 00:32:28,209
If only a single person chooses the black coin,

913
00:32:28,209 --> 00:32:32,080
that person will win 20 coins.

914
00:32:32,080 --> 00:32:34,780
(The only person who chooses black will win 20 coins.)

915
00:32:34,780 --> 00:32:36,709
It's quite the temptation.

916
00:32:36,709 --> 00:32:38,580
- You'll be a front-runner. - If we unite,

917
00:32:38,580 --> 00:32:40,689
we can all receive 10 coins each.

918
00:32:40,689 --> 00:32:42,590
Kwang Soo wouldn't risk it and choose the black coin.

919
00:32:42,590 --> 00:32:43,590
He already has a lot.

920
00:32:43,590 --> 00:32:44,665
I already have a lot.

921
00:32:44,990 --> 00:32:46,219
There's no reason for me to take that risk.

922
00:32:46,219 --> 00:32:48,065
No, Kwang Soo will take the risk.

923
00:32:48,229 --> 00:32:50,899
There's a higher chance of losing if you choose the black coin.

924
00:32:50,899 --> 00:32:52,030
But Kwang Soo will still choose it.

925
00:32:52,030 --> 00:32:54,000
You...

926
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:56,399
(What are you saying?)

927
00:32:56,399 --> 00:32:58,270
You shouldn't have got on Jong Kook's bad side.

928
00:32:58,270 --> 00:32:59,300
Kwang Soo will.

929
00:32:59,300 --> 00:33:02,110
- I would if I were him. - You're on Jong Kook's bad side.

930
00:33:02,110 --> 00:33:03,909
- He would. - Jong Kook...

931
00:33:03,909 --> 00:33:05,810
- If I were him... - He stole two coins from Jong Kook.

932
00:33:05,810 --> 00:33:07,825
Can I return what I took from him?

933
00:33:08,479 --> 00:33:10,550
- Can I? - You made the wrong move.

934
00:33:10,550 --> 00:33:12,294
The Kwang Soo I know would choose black.

935
00:33:12,379 --> 00:33:15,649
Just so you know, he'll hold this against you even next week.

936
00:33:15,649 --> 00:33:16,794
Next week?

937
00:33:16,850 --> 00:33:17,959
No, this month.

938
00:33:17,959 --> 00:33:18,990
- This month. - What?

939
00:33:18,990 --> 00:33:20,135
How suffocating.

940
00:33:20,290 --> 00:33:22,659
- He said "this month" just now. - You shouldn't have.

941
00:33:22,659 --> 00:33:23,790
- He's now a target. - You should apologize.

942
00:33:23,790 --> 00:33:26,030
- Then until the fan meet-and-greet? - Exactly.

943
00:33:26,030 --> 00:33:28,199
Then let's just all choose the black coin.

944
00:33:28,199 --> 00:33:30,199
- Exactly. - We'll all receive 10 coins.

945
00:33:30,199 --> 00:33:31,570
Let's begin the race fair and square.

946
00:33:31,570 --> 00:33:32,714
Let's choose the black coin.

947
00:33:32,770 --> 00:33:34,469
We'll all choose the black coin, all right?

948
00:33:34,469 --> 00:33:36,085
- Everyone's going black? - Yes.

949
00:33:36,110 --> 00:33:37,979
(Should I trust him?)

950
00:33:37,979 --> 00:33:39,879
- I'm not kidding. - Okay.

951
00:33:39,879 --> 00:33:41,479
- Let's do this. - Time's up, guys.

952
00:33:41,479 --> 00:33:43,080
Jung Min, will you choose the black coin?

953
00:33:43,080 --> 00:33:44,979
Yes, I'm on board.

954
00:33:44,979 --> 00:33:46,179
Okay, let's choose the black coin.

955
00:33:46,179 --> 00:33:48,389
(After coming to an agreement, Haha goes to choose the coin first.)

956
00:33:48,389 --> 00:33:51,635
Please choose a coin between the black, the blue, or the red.

957
00:33:53,119 --> 00:33:56,304
I'll be mad if only one ends up choosing the black coin.

958
00:33:57,560 --> 00:33:58,830
I doubt it.

959
00:33:58,830 --> 00:34:00,635
(He chooses one after pondering.)

960
00:34:01,869 --> 00:34:02,869
(I don't know what'll happen.)

961
00:34:02,869 --> 00:34:05,645
I have no idea how this will pan out.

962
00:34:05,969 --> 00:34:07,840
I'm sure he chose the red coin.

963
00:34:07,840 --> 00:34:09,840
No, I kept my promise.

964
00:34:09,840 --> 00:34:13,454
I do think that many will end up choosing the black one.

965
00:34:13,539 --> 00:34:15,355
No one will dare do this.

966
00:34:15,479 --> 00:34:17,695
Only I can make this choice because I'm rich with coins.

967
00:34:17,950 --> 00:34:20,454
Gosh, my pouch is bursting with coins.

968
00:34:20,950 --> 00:34:23,490
It took you that long to choose the black coin?

969
00:34:23,490 --> 00:34:24,519
That's not it.

970
00:34:24,519 --> 00:34:25,959
(You're mistaken.)

971
00:34:25,959 --> 00:34:27,590
- Just watch me. - Okay, go ahead.

972
00:34:27,590 --> 00:34:29,590
- Sure. - See how long it takes me.

973
00:34:29,590 --> 00:34:31,574
I'll see if you're a coward or not.

974
00:34:32,399 --> 00:34:34,099
Do I just take it?

975
00:34:34,099 --> 00:34:35,930
We're watching you, Jae Seok.

976
00:34:35,930 --> 00:34:37,145
So what you said...

977
00:34:37,370 --> 00:34:38,574
You chose the red coin.

978
00:34:39,470 --> 00:34:40,915
The pouch seems red.

979
00:34:41,570 --> 00:34:43,370
- He chose the red one. - It's definitely not the black one.

980
00:34:43,370 --> 00:34:45,054
Unbelievable.

981
00:34:45,180 --> 00:34:49,025
(Everyone chooses a coin while distrust swirls over them.)

982
00:34:49,180 --> 00:34:50,479
The result is in.

983
00:34:50,479 --> 00:34:52,149
We'll open it 1 by 1...

984
00:34:52,149 --> 00:34:53,979
- Is the result interesting? - starting from Haha.

985
00:34:53,979 --> 00:34:56,525
- It is very interesting. - Is it?

986
00:34:56,550 --> 00:34:58,320
- Let's see. - Haha said he'd pick black.

987
00:34:58,320 --> 00:34:59,465
(Is the result interesting?)

988
00:34:59,620 --> 00:35:02,390
I'm serious. I really did.

989
00:35:02,390 --> 00:35:03,605
Let me see.

990
00:35:03,660 --> 00:35:06,030
- I'm serious. - Just take it out.

991
00:35:06,030 --> 00:35:07,669
(What's Haha's coin?)

992
00:35:07,669 --> 00:35:10,129
- Here. - I knew it.

993
00:35:10,129 --> 00:35:12,215
- My gosh. - I had no expectations of him.

994
00:35:12,300 --> 00:35:13,470
That's good.

995
00:35:13,470 --> 00:35:15,870
- I can get 20 coins this way. - I'm sure he picked red.

996
00:35:15,870 --> 00:35:17,585
Why would he pick blue when he's wearing a red vest?

997
00:35:18,180 --> 00:35:20,884
(Jong Kook picked red.)

998
00:35:21,149 --> 00:35:22,309
I don't understand him.

999
00:35:22,309 --> 00:35:24,494
- Okay. So Min, you're up. - You're unbelievable.

1000
00:35:25,950 --> 00:35:27,019
I'll tell you later.

1001
00:35:27,019 --> 00:35:28,090
(So Min picked blue.)

1002
00:35:28,090 --> 00:35:29,364
You're wearing a red vest.

1003
00:35:29,419 --> 00:35:30,525
Jung Min.

1004
00:35:30,649 --> 00:35:32,094
(He shows blue bashfully.)

1005
00:35:32,990 --> 00:35:34,890
(Park Jung Min picked blue too.)

1006
00:35:34,890 --> 00:35:36,034
Se Chan?

1007
00:35:36,059 --> 00:35:38,174
- Okay? Did you pick blue? - I picked black.

1008
00:35:38,200 --> 00:35:39,430
- Jong Kook. - Okay!

1009
00:35:39,430 --> 00:35:40,729
This is good.

1010
00:35:40,729 --> 00:35:41,970
I picked red.

1011
00:35:41,970 --> 00:35:43,930
No one picked black?

1012
00:35:43,930 --> 00:35:45,145
(There's no one who picked black.)

1013
00:35:46,039 --> 00:35:47,169
- Red? - Good.

1014
00:35:47,169 --> 00:35:49,240
The score is 3 to 3 now.

1015
00:35:49,240 --> 00:35:50,445
It's Yu Hwa's turn.

1016
00:35:50,879 --> 00:35:52,510
(Yu Hwa picked blue.)

1017
00:35:52,510 --> 00:35:54,410
- What if someone picked black? - This is amazing.

1018
00:35:54,410 --> 00:35:56,309
You'll finally get to see black here.

1019
00:35:56,309 --> 00:35:57,824
(What are the remaining 4 people's choices?)

1020
00:35:58,019 --> 00:36:00,120
(If no one chooses black,)

1021
00:36:00,120 --> 00:36:01,849
(those who choose the majority color will receive 5 coins.)

1022
00:36:01,849 --> 00:36:04,720
(If only a single person chooses the black coin,)

1023
00:36:04,720 --> 00:36:07,764
(that person will win 20 coins.)

1024
00:36:08,260 --> 00:36:09,459
Red!

1025
00:36:09,459 --> 00:36:10,959
It's 4 to 4.

1026
00:36:10,959 --> 00:36:14,269
(With a score is 4 to 4,)

1027
00:36:14,269 --> 00:36:16,300
(Ji Yeon shows a red coin.)

1028
00:36:16,300 --> 00:36:18,539
(4 blue coins to 5 red coins)

1029
00:36:18,539 --> 00:36:20,399
All right. We have two people left.

1030
00:36:20,399 --> 00:36:21,470
Will there be one black coin?

1031
00:36:21,470 --> 00:36:22,610
They will show their coins at the same time.

1032
00:36:22,610 --> 00:36:24,110
I said I picked black.

1033
00:36:24,110 --> 00:36:26,280
(What did Kwang Soo and Jae Seok choose?)

1034
00:36:26,280 --> 00:36:28,355
Jae Seok, open yours first.

1035
00:36:29,079 --> 00:36:30,994
The score is 5 to 5 now.

1036
00:36:31,249 --> 00:36:34,255
(The current score is 5 blue coins to 5 red coins.)

1037
00:36:34,720 --> 00:36:36,849
Depending on the last person's coin...

1038
00:36:36,849 --> 00:36:38,220
(If Kwang Soo chose black, he will get 20 coins alone.)

1039
00:36:38,220 --> 00:36:39,360
Is it black?

1040
00:36:39,360 --> 00:36:41,030
(If Kwang Soo chose blue or red, his team will get 5 coins.)

1041
00:36:41,030 --> 00:36:42,090
Open it.

1042
00:36:42,090 --> 00:36:44,189
(Yes!)

1043
00:36:44,189 --> 00:36:47,634
(Kwang Soo is the only person who chose black.)

1044
00:36:48,070 --> 00:36:49,070
I can't believe this.

1045
00:36:49,070 --> 00:36:50,370
(Speechless)

1046
00:36:50,370 --> 00:36:51,970
He's a hoodwinker.

1047
00:36:51,970 --> 00:36:53,344
- This is unbelievable. - Yes!

1048
00:36:53,470 --> 00:36:55,169
Did you receive instructions or what?

1049
00:36:55,169 --> 00:36:57,209
- He took a risk. - If Kwang Soo doesn't lose coins,

1050
00:36:57,209 --> 00:36:58,479
he will at least get Korean beef set.

1051
00:36:58,479 --> 00:36:59,640
(He has 34 coins now.)

1052
00:36:59,640 --> 00:37:02,324
- That's good enough. - But I just can't stop here.

1053
00:37:02,910 --> 00:37:04,355
I want the LED mask.

1054
00:37:05,249 --> 00:37:07,280
No, I can't let you have it.

1055
00:37:07,280 --> 00:37:08,625
I'll give it to my mom.

1056
00:37:08,820 --> 00:37:11,435
- I'll make my family happy. - Kwang Soo is unbelievable.

1057
00:37:12,120 --> 00:37:13,364
This is amazing.

1058
00:37:13,419 --> 00:37:14,559
I told you.

1059
00:37:14,559 --> 00:37:16,005
He has a lot of coins, so...

1060
00:37:16,090 --> 00:37:18,634
(Mom, I'll make sure to win the LED mask.)

1061
00:37:18,930 --> 00:37:22,744
(Current Number of R Coins)

1062
00:37:23,499 --> 00:37:25,875
(After the fierce mission...)

1063
00:37:26,039 --> 00:37:28,815
(They get on the van to move to the next destination.)

1064
00:37:29,110 --> 00:37:30,269
(They all sit where they want.)

1065
00:37:30,269 --> 00:37:31,884
Have a seat. It's okay.

1066
00:37:32,340 --> 00:37:34,384
It's funny. It's a funny seat.

1067
00:37:35,280 --> 00:37:37,795
(Is this a funny seat?)

1068
00:37:38,620 --> 00:37:39,820
Let's go.

1069
00:37:39,820 --> 00:37:40,919
(She just takes a seat without knowing anything.)

1070
00:37:40,919 --> 00:37:42,025
Hey.

1071
00:37:42,220 --> 00:37:43,849
(Seok Jin is getting in.)

1072
00:37:43,849 --> 00:37:45,695
(Letting out a single cry)

1073
00:37:45,959 --> 00:37:47,090
(Yu Hwa is...)

1074
00:37:47,090 --> 00:37:49,565
(in my seat.)

1075
00:37:50,090 --> 00:37:52,174
(Hesitant)

1076
00:37:52,930 --> 00:37:55,775
(He sits in front of Yu Hwa after hesitating a little.)

1077
00:37:56,399 --> 00:37:57,430
What?

1078
00:37:57,430 --> 00:37:58,645
(That's my seat.)

1079
00:37:58,840 --> 00:38:00,744
(Seok Jin just lost his seat.)

1080
00:38:01,340 --> 00:38:02,740
(Why are they laughing?)

1081
00:38:02,740 --> 00:38:03,870
Why do you think it is?

1082
00:38:03,870 --> 00:38:05,454
- What's funny? - Look at her.

1083
00:38:05,680 --> 00:38:07,315
- Seok Jin is... - She's so cute.

1084
00:38:07,510 --> 00:38:09,724
- Yu Hwa's sitting there. - He hesitated for five seconds.

1085
00:38:09,849 --> 00:38:12,054
- I see. - This is so funny.

1086
00:38:12,349 --> 00:38:14,424
I haven't seen anything like this for the past 10 years.

1087
00:38:14,519 --> 00:38:16,950
I didn't even go to the restroom.

1088
00:38:16,950 --> 00:38:18,059
For your seat?

1089
00:38:18,059 --> 00:38:19,289
This is good. Yu Hwa, I'm glad you're sitting there.

1090
00:38:19,289 --> 00:38:21,764
He was standing next to Yu Hwa for about five seconds.

1091
00:38:22,360 --> 00:38:24,599
Anyway, Kwang Soo was unbelievable.

1092
00:38:24,599 --> 00:38:26,574
I have 34 coins.

1093
00:38:26,760 --> 00:38:28,769
I think I'm done here.

1094
00:38:28,769 --> 00:38:30,800
This is just the beginning.

1095
00:38:30,800 --> 00:38:32,114
I should've picked black.

1096
00:38:32,240 --> 00:38:33,970
I was going to pick black.

1097
00:38:33,970 --> 00:38:36,269
But I didn't want to lose 10 coins.

1098
00:38:36,269 --> 00:38:38,315
Seok Jin, do you want to go home? Why are you looking out the window?

1099
00:38:38,740 --> 00:38:40,815
What are you thinking about?

1100
00:38:40,910 --> 00:38:42,149
I don't think it's about your wife.

1101
00:38:42,149 --> 00:38:43,379
Who are you thinking about?

1102
00:38:43,379 --> 00:38:45,050
- Why are you looking out? - I don't think it's your wife.

1103
00:38:45,050 --> 00:38:46,519
No. I wasn't thinking...

1104
00:38:46,519 --> 00:38:47,924
Why?

1105
00:38:48,550 --> 00:38:50,050
Why are you thinking about my wife?

1106
00:38:50,050 --> 00:38:51,519
No, I was thinking about R Money.

1107
00:38:51,519 --> 00:38:52,820
You seem flustered.

1108
00:38:52,820 --> 00:38:54,260
Why did you think about Byul?

1109
00:38:54,260 --> 00:38:56,530
It's not that I thought about Byul.

1110
00:38:56,530 --> 00:38:57,559
You just said Byul.

1111
00:38:57,559 --> 00:38:58,760
I thought this was a star.

1112
00:38:58,760 --> 00:39:00,930
Don't you know that you're my role model?

1113
00:39:00,930 --> 00:39:02,105
I do, you punk.

1114
00:39:02,700 --> 00:39:04,614
(I do, you punk.)

1115
00:39:05,640 --> 00:39:06,669
You know what?

1116
00:39:06,669 --> 00:39:09,740
I haven't found anyone attractive for a long time.

1117
00:39:09,740 --> 00:39:11,709
I only care about my wife.

1118
00:39:11,709 --> 00:39:13,510
So Min is crying looking out the window.

1119
00:39:13,510 --> 00:39:15,985
(So Min is crying looking out the window.)

1120
00:39:17,149 --> 00:39:18,594
"What am I then?"

1121
00:39:18,749 --> 00:39:20,849
Honestly, I wanted to be the last one to leave the waiting room,

1122
00:39:20,849 --> 00:39:22,665
but Jae Seok wouldn't leave.

1123
00:39:23,349 --> 00:39:24,959
(There she goes again.)

1124
00:39:24,959 --> 00:39:26,059
Can we do this?

1125
00:39:26,059 --> 00:39:28,835
(He's not even sure if they can make jokes like this.)

1126
00:39:29,689 --> 00:39:32,160
(Seok Jin and So Min's forbidden love)

1127
00:39:32,160 --> 00:39:33,959
- Can we do this? - As long as his wife is okay,

1128
00:39:33,959 --> 00:39:35,229
I like this joke.

1129
00:39:35,229 --> 00:39:37,704
I don't think we can do this in Korea.

1130
00:39:38,269 --> 00:39:40,300
We can't, but So Min keeps making that joke.

1131
00:39:40,300 --> 00:39:42,614
(We can't, but So Min keeps making that joke.)

1132
00:39:43,410 --> 00:39:45,180
- I can't say anything. - No, you can't.

1133
00:39:45,180 --> 00:39:47,180
So I just stay quiet.

1134
00:39:47,180 --> 00:39:49,379
Even when you're quiet, I can see your heart is fluttering.

1135
00:39:49,379 --> 00:39:51,795
(Even when you're quiet, I can see your heart is fluttering.)

1136
00:39:52,019 --> 00:39:54,280
- You seem excited. - He's blushing.

1137
00:39:54,280 --> 00:39:55,465
His cheeks are red.

1138
00:39:56,249 --> 00:39:58,789
My heart is filled only with my wife.

1139
00:39:58,789 --> 00:40:00,120
That's romantic.

1140
00:40:00,120 --> 00:40:02,729
Jung Min doesn't appear in a lot of variety shows.

1141
00:40:02,729 --> 00:40:04,030
I want him to talk a lot.

1142
00:40:04,030 --> 00:40:05,899
Jung Min died in the movie.

1143
00:40:05,899 --> 00:40:07,729
- What movie? - What's the one with Lee Byung Hun?

1144
00:40:07,729 --> 00:40:09,430
- "Keys to the Heart". - It was fun.

1145
00:40:09,430 --> 00:40:11,514
He played the piano in the movie.

1146
00:40:11,599 --> 00:40:13,445
- What? - He played the piano himself.

1147
00:40:13,740 --> 00:40:14,840
How did you do that?

1148
00:40:14,840 --> 00:40:15,970
He must've practiced so hard.

1149
00:40:15,970 --> 00:40:17,915
I practiced hard.

1150
00:40:17,979 --> 00:40:19,340
- That's amazing. - For how long?

1151
00:40:19,340 --> 00:40:20,979
For about six months.

1152
00:40:20,979 --> 00:40:22,079
- Six months? - Yes.

1153
00:40:22,079 --> 00:40:23,910
You played the song for six months?

1154
00:40:23,910 --> 00:40:25,795
- Did you play the piano before? - No.

1155
00:40:26,149 --> 00:40:28,519
- That's impressive. - He's amazing.

1156
00:40:28,519 --> 00:40:30,395
(Jung Min is unbelievable.)

1157
00:40:30,620 --> 00:40:31,895
What is this place?

1158
00:40:31,990 --> 00:40:33,435
I smell sesame oil.

1159
00:40:33,590 --> 00:40:35,864
- It smells so good. - It smells delicious.

1160
00:40:35,959 --> 00:40:37,530
They have seafood stew here.

1161
00:40:37,530 --> 00:40:39,829
- Seafood stew? I love it. - It sounds delicious.

1162
00:40:39,829 --> 00:40:40,959
It must be really good.

1163
00:40:40,959 --> 00:40:44,204
You will be divided into three teams here.

1164
00:40:44,269 --> 00:40:45,300
It's a team game again.

1165
00:40:45,300 --> 00:40:48,039
The second mission is...

1166
00:40:48,039 --> 00:40:49,370
Call My Name.

1167
00:40:49,370 --> 00:40:50,715
- Call My Name? - Call My Name.

1168
00:40:51,039 --> 00:40:54,079
It's a match among three leaders of each team.

1169
00:40:54,079 --> 00:40:56,079
Each of you will pick one card...

1170
00:40:56,079 --> 00:40:58,620
and put it on your hat without looking at it.

1171
00:40:58,620 --> 00:41:00,919
You should guess who the figure in your card is...

1172
00:41:00,919 --> 00:41:04,324
by asking questions and answering to each other.

1173
00:41:04,390 --> 00:41:07,490
If you give a wrong answer, you'll be hit with a toy hammer.

1174
00:41:07,490 --> 00:41:09,729
The team with the highest score wins the game,

1175
00:41:09,729 --> 00:41:11,930
and they get five coins each.

1176
00:41:11,930 --> 00:41:14,329
They also get to steal five coins...

1177
00:41:14,329 --> 00:41:16,974
from a member you want.

1178
00:41:17,129 --> 00:41:18,870
The team in second place don't get coins,

1179
00:41:18,870 --> 00:41:20,070
but they will get to eat a meal.

1180
00:41:20,070 --> 00:41:22,740
The losing team gets only rice and laver.

1181
00:41:22,740 --> 00:41:24,110
Let's win the game and eat.

1182
00:41:24,110 --> 00:41:26,309
Now you should divide yourselves into three teams.

1183
00:41:26,309 --> 00:41:27,439
All right then.

1184
00:41:27,439 --> 00:41:28,879
I'll divide you guys into three teams.

1185
00:41:28,879 --> 00:41:30,180
(I'll divide you guys into three teams.)

1186
00:41:30,180 --> 00:41:32,494
Why would you do that?

1187
00:41:32,820 --> 00:41:35,189
(He pretends to be generous.)

1188
00:41:35,189 --> 00:41:36,665
- Who do you think you are? - Excuse me.

1189
00:41:36,820 --> 00:41:38,490
You don't even have many coins.

1190
00:41:38,490 --> 00:41:39,990
- Let's give it a try though. - All right.

1191
00:41:39,990 --> 00:41:41,360
- Let me... - Who do you think you are?

1192
00:41:41,360 --> 00:41:43,165
With my big data,

1193
00:41:43,229 --> 00:41:46,430
I'll make the best teams.

1194
00:41:46,430 --> 00:41:47,559
Jong Kook, stand there.

1195
00:41:47,559 --> 00:41:49,229
- Me? Okay. - Yes, please.

1196
00:41:49,229 --> 00:41:52,344
This is based on the number of R Coins.

1197
00:41:52,539 --> 00:41:53,539
That's important.

1198
00:41:53,539 --> 00:41:55,840
- I'll form good teams. - Okay. That's good.

1199
00:41:55,840 --> 00:41:57,215
- Jong Kook. - Yes.

1200
00:41:57,669 --> 00:41:59,809
Let me check the big data again.

1201
00:41:59,809 --> 00:42:02,249
- You should trust me. - Okay. We will.

1202
00:42:02,249 --> 00:42:03,879
- Is that the big data you have? - Yes.

1203
00:42:03,879 --> 00:42:06,280
(Is that the big data you have?)

1204
00:42:06,280 --> 00:42:07,780
This is the big data.

1205
00:42:07,780 --> 00:42:09,550
- Is that it? - I thought there'd be more.

1206
00:42:09,550 --> 00:42:11,490
This is big. It's big data.

1207
00:42:11,490 --> 00:42:12,919
That's the only thing you have.

1208
00:42:12,919 --> 00:42:15,490
- This is big data. - Okay. Good.

1209
00:42:15,490 --> 00:42:17,304
- It's cutting edge. - First,

1210
00:42:17,390 --> 00:42:20,005
- Jong Kook should be there. - Okay.

1211
00:42:21,700 --> 00:42:22,829
Jung Min.

1212
00:42:22,829 --> 00:42:24,399
(Jung Min joins Jong Kook's team.)

1213
00:42:24,399 --> 00:42:25,470
- Jung Min. - They're in the same team?

1214
00:42:25,470 --> 00:42:26,939
- Okay. - Jung Min is there.

1215
00:42:26,939 --> 00:42:28,244
Let me see.

1216
00:42:28,610 --> 00:42:29,815
And Yu Hwa.

1217
00:42:30,970 --> 00:42:32,284
- Gosh. - What's wrong?

1218
00:42:32,809 --> 00:42:34,979
(Letting out a sigh)

1219
00:42:34,979 --> 00:42:36,884
Wait. You don't like her?

1220
00:42:37,209 --> 00:42:38,979
- What was that about? - His reaction was...

1221
00:42:38,979 --> 00:42:41,590
He didn't seem too happy in his reaction.

1222
00:42:41,590 --> 00:42:43,025
- Jung Min. - That's not true.

1223
00:42:43,050 --> 00:42:44,120
It's surprising.

1224
00:42:44,120 --> 00:42:46,764
I have two guests on my team.

1225
00:42:46,990 --> 00:42:49,634
And there's Seok Jin.

1226
00:42:50,559 --> 00:42:51,775
Jee Seok Jin.

1227
00:42:52,160 --> 00:42:54,674
- And Jeon So Min. - No, I don't want to.

1228
00:42:55,430 --> 00:42:57,404
(No, I don't want to.)

1229
00:42:57,499 --> 00:42:58,945
Don't do this.

1230
00:42:59,070 --> 00:43:01,045
- Stop it. - It's just the big data.

1231
00:43:01,070 --> 00:43:02,340
It's from the big data.

1232
00:43:02,340 --> 00:43:03,539
It's just from the big data.

1233
00:43:03,539 --> 00:43:04,939
- This is good. - What data is that?

1234
00:43:04,939 --> 00:43:06,079
- Is there any ground? - He has 10...

1235
00:43:06,079 --> 00:43:07,510
He has 10 coins and So Min has minus 5.

1236
00:43:07,510 --> 00:43:08,709
That's good.

1237
00:43:08,709 --> 00:43:10,709
- No. - Just join his team.

1238
00:43:10,709 --> 00:43:12,320
- Go, So Min. - It sounds perfect.

1239
00:43:12,320 --> 00:43:13,879
- In total... - Let me join them.

1240
00:43:13,879 --> 00:43:15,494
The three teams need to have similar numbers of coins.

1241
00:43:15,749 --> 00:43:16,990
Okay. Come here.

1242
00:43:16,990 --> 00:43:18,395
- It's done. - This is it.

1243
00:43:19,559 --> 00:43:21,890
You should put the card on your head.

1244
00:43:21,890 --> 00:43:23,704
You shouldn't look at it though.

1245
00:43:23,760 --> 00:43:25,704
We can't lie about the cards.

1246
00:43:25,760 --> 00:43:27,430
Can we ask direct questions?

1247
00:43:27,430 --> 00:43:30,174
Like "Is it a man or a woman?" Can we do that? Is it okay?

1248
00:43:30,499 --> 00:43:32,174
Please put it on your forehead.

1249
00:43:32,899 --> 00:43:34,145
You guess the name on your head.

1250
00:43:35,539 --> 00:43:38,415
(Song Ji Hyo is IU.)

1251
00:43:39,010 --> 00:43:40,079
All right.

1252
00:43:40,079 --> 00:43:42,654
(Jee Seok Jin is Bruce Lee.)

1253
00:43:43,280 --> 00:43:46,755
(Choi Yu Hwa is General Yi Sun Sin.)

1254
00:43:46,820 --> 00:43:47,979
This is hard.

1255
00:43:47,979 --> 00:43:49,550
(The first person to give the right answer gets 3 points.)

1256
00:43:49,550 --> 00:43:51,890
Am I attractive?

1257
00:43:51,890 --> 00:43:54,364
(Am I attractive?)

1258
00:43:54,959 --> 00:43:56,435
- Am I attractive? - Yes.

1259
00:43:56,530 --> 00:43:57,629
(He's so attractive.)

1260
00:43:57,629 --> 00:43:58,760
Very attractive.

1261
00:43:58,760 --> 00:44:00,375
Am I a man?

1262
00:44:00,700 --> 00:44:01,870
Yes.

1263
00:44:01,870 --> 00:44:02,999
An old man?

1264
00:44:02,999 --> 00:44:04,229
(Am I an old man?)

1265
00:44:04,229 --> 00:44:05,769
I've never thought that way.

1266
00:44:05,769 --> 00:44:07,174
But he is quite old.

1267
00:44:08,169 --> 00:44:09,570
Wait. The question is...

1268
00:44:09,570 --> 00:44:10,870
Am I a man?

1269
00:44:10,870 --> 00:44:12,809
(Am I a man?)

1270
00:44:12,809 --> 00:44:14,824
She has very little chance of being a man.

1271
00:44:15,379 --> 00:44:16,654
What was that?

1272
00:44:16,979 --> 00:44:19,519
(She has very little chance of being a man?)

1273
00:44:19,519 --> 00:44:20,680
What was that?

1274
00:44:20,680 --> 00:44:22,220
You should just say no.

1275
00:44:22,220 --> 00:44:24,324
- What is he talking about? - You can't do that.

1276
00:44:24,959 --> 00:44:27,419
What am I supposed to say then?

1277
00:44:27,419 --> 00:44:29,735
Am I alive now?

1278
00:44:29,829 --> 00:44:31,335
- Yes, you are. - I'm alive now?

1279
00:44:31,499 --> 00:44:32,860
Am I alive?

1280
00:44:32,860 --> 00:44:33,959
It might be a man?

1281
00:44:33,959 --> 00:44:35,070
Am I alive?

1282
00:44:35,070 --> 00:44:36,344
Am I alive now?

1283
00:44:39,439 --> 00:44:41,470
You can't just ask Seok Jin questions...

1284
00:44:41,470 --> 00:44:42,610
and ignore his questions.

1285
00:44:42,610 --> 00:44:45,185
(You should answer his questions too.)

1286
00:44:45,510 --> 00:44:46,809
How can he guess?

1287
00:44:46,809 --> 00:44:49,284
Why aren't you answering Seok Jin's questions?

1288
00:44:49,849 --> 00:44:51,795
How could you pretend not to hear him?

1289
00:44:52,620 --> 00:44:53,919
Please answer my question.

1290
00:44:53,919 --> 00:44:55,789
Please meet Seok Jin's eyes...

1291
00:44:55,789 --> 00:44:57,349
and answer his question.

1292
00:44:57,349 --> 00:44:58,419
No one answered his question.

1293
00:44:58,419 --> 00:44:59,559
Am I alive?

1294
00:44:59,559 --> 00:45:00,660
No, you aren't.

1295
00:45:00,660 --> 00:45:01,689
(She finally answers.)

1296
00:45:01,689 --> 00:45:03,189
How old am I?

1297
00:45:03,189 --> 00:45:04,660
(How old am I?)

1298
00:45:04,660 --> 00:45:06,360
How old are you?

1299
00:45:06,360 --> 00:45:07,574
(That's a good question!)

1300
00:45:08,169 --> 00:45:09,599
You are less than 40 years old.

1301
00:45:09,599 --> 00:45:12,375
(You are less than 40 years old.)

1302
00:45:12,669 --> 00:45:13,740
My goodness.

1303
00:45:13,740 --> 00:45:15,610
- It's true. - That's right.

1304
00:45:15,610 --> 00:45:17,209
- This is insane. - It's true.

1305
00:45:17,209 --> 00:45:18,439
- It's true. - It's true.

1306
00:45:18,439 --> 00:45:20,715
- It's true. - He didn't lie.

1307
00:45:21,010 --> 00:45:22,110
- This is insane. - It's true.

1308
00:45:22,110 --> 00:45:23,809
It's true.

1309
00:45:23,809 --> 00:45:25,120
- Am I a comedian? - What?

1310
00:45:25,120 --> 00:45:26,120
A comedian.

1311
00:45:26,120 --> 00:45:27,954
No, you aren't.

1312
00:45:27,979 --> 00:45:30,050
Thank goodness we made her go first.

1313
00:45:30,050 --> 00:45:31,295
We have no expectations for her.

1314
00:45:31,519 --> 00:45:33,559
I have seen a comedian play this man.

1315
00:45:33,559 --> 00:45:34,930
- That's right. - He is right.

1316
00:45:34,930 --> 00:45:36,459
- Good job. - What's my last name?

1317
00:45:36,459 --> 00:45:38,375
I can't give you your last name.

1318
00:45:39,059 --> 00:45:40,459
Ask about your profession,

1319
00:45:40,459 --> 00:45:41,999
not your last name.

1320
00:45:41,999 --> 00:45:43,829
- What's my profession? - Your profession?

1321
00:45:43,829 --> 00:45:44,945
(Flustered)

1322
00:45:45,240 --> 00:45:46,240
(What should I say?)

1323
00:45:46,240 --> 00:45:47,640
- What? - Say it.

1324
00:45:47,640 --> 00:45:49,070
- Your profession? - Yes.

1325
00:45:49,070 --> 00:45:50,685
You are a civil servant.

1326
00:45:50,939 --> 00:45:51,939
A civil servant.

1327
00:45:51,939 --> 00:45:54,240
(General Yi Sun Sin was a civil servant.)

1328
00:45:54,240 --> 00:45:56,585
- A civil servant. - Don't be like that!

1329
00:45:57,180 --> 00:45:58,579
- It's true! - Just tell her the profession.

1330
00:45:58,579 --> 00:45:59,820
It's true. A civil servant.

1331
00:45:59,820 --> 00:46:01,079
It's true, but...

1332
00:46:01,079 --> 00:46:03,724
- Tell her the profession. - I will do that. Okay.

1333
00:46:03,919 --> 00:46:05,660
- You are a soldier. - That's right.

1334
00:46:05,660 --> 00:46:07,160
You are a soldier.

1335
00:46:07,160 --> 00:46:09,090
- What's my profession? - Your profession?

1336
00:46:09,090 --> 00:46:10,260
(What's my profession?)

1337
00:46:10,260 --> 00:46:12,129
You are a multitalented entertainer.

1338
00:46:12,129 --> 00:46:13,629
- That's right. - It's true.

1339
00:46:13,629 --> 00:46:14,629
What's my profession?

1340
00:46:14,629 --> 00:46:16,404
(It's my turn.)

1341
00:46:17,329 --> 00:46:19,614
Why won't anyone answer my question?

1342
00:46:21,669 --> 00:46:23,740
Hey! Answer his question!

1343
00:46:23,740 --> 00:46:26,610
- Everyone ignoring me! - He doesn't know anything.

1344
00:46:26,610 --> 00:46:27,910
Yu Hwa.

1345
00:46:27,910 --> 00:46:29,780
- You aren't telling him anything. - Seriously.

1346
00:46:29,780 --> 00:46:30,879
You need to answer his questions.

1347
00:46:30,879 --> 00:46:32,749
I don't know anything.

1348
00:46:32,749 --> 00:46:35,019
- Tell him the profession. - Please do that.

1349
00:46:35,019 --> 00:46:36,525
Give him a clear answer.

1350
00:46:36,820 --> 00:46:38,260
He only has one profession.

1351
00:46:38,260 --> 00:46:39,459
- No, he doesn't. - What's my profession?

1352
00:46:39,459 --> 00:46:41,419
- A multitalented entertainer. - That's right.

1353
00:46:41,419 --> 00:46:43,134
- A multitalented entertainer. - You are really good at sports.

1354
00:46:43,729 --> 00:46:45,204
- Let me answer. - Go ahead.

1355
00:46:45,229 --> 00:46:48,645
(Did Ji Hyo figure out that she is IU?)

1356
00:46:48,930 --> 00:46:50,145
Baek Jong Won.

1357
00:46:51,899 --> 00:46:53,045
Baek Jong Won.

1358
00:46:53,640 --> 00:46:55,244
He told you that you aren't a man.

1359
00:46:55,809 --> 00:46:56,840
What is wrong with her?

1360
00:46:56,840 --> 00:46:58,910
Ji Hyo asks questions but forgets the answers.

1361
00:46:58,910 --> 00:47:00,680
- She forgets the answers. - I know. This is driving me crazy.

1362
00:47:00,680 --> 00:47:01,924
Oh, I am not a man.

1363
00:47:02,079 --> 00:47:03,280
- Am I alive? - What?

1364
00:47:03,280 --> 00:47:04,585
Am I alive?

1365
00:47:05,180 --> 00:47:06,879
(That's a sharp question.)

1366
00:47:06,879 --> 00:47:08,324
That would be hard.

1367
00:47:08,649 --> 00:47:10,689
What is your problem?

1368
00:47:10,689 --> 00:47:13,795
That would be more than hard.

1369
00:47:14,160 --> 00:47:17,360
- "That would be hard"? - Give a clear answer.

1370
00:47:17,360 --> 00:47:18,430
- You... - Let me answer.

1371
00:47:18,430 --> 00:47:19,499
- If he is alive... - Go ahead.

1372
00:47:19,499 --> 00:47:20,800
General Yi Sun Sin.

1373
00:47:20,800 --> 00:47:24,605
(She isn't sure but...)

1374
00:47:24,629 --> 00:47:26,415
- He was a soldier. - Correct.

1375
00:47:27,140 --> 00:47:28,840
No way! No way!

1376
00:47:28,840 --> 00:47:30,410
(Yu Hwa guessed the answer, "Yi Sun Sin",)

1377
00:47:30,410 --> 00:47:32,014
(from "A middle-aged soldier who passed away".)

1378
00:47:32,379 --> 00:47:33,610
How did you know?

1379
00:47:33,610 --> 00:47:35,180
- How did you know? - Yi Sun Sin.

1380
00:47:35,180 --> 00:47:37,054
He was a soldier...

1381
00:47:37,180 --> 00:47:38,979
from back in the days.

1382
00:47:38,979 --> 00:47:41,349
- "A soldier who passed away". - No way.

1383
00:47:41,349 --> 00:47:42,789
- She realized he was someone great. - That's right.

1384
00:47:42,789 --> 00:47:44,990
It was a hard one.

1385
00:47:44,990 --> 00:47:46,465
The team gets three points.

1386
00:47:48,459 --> 00:47:50,364
We need to place second.

1387
00:47:50,829 --> 00:47:52,700
- We can eat that way, right? - Let's place second.

1388
00:47:52,700 --> 00:47:55,530
What do I do these days?

1389
00:47:55,530 --> 00:47:56,700
(Bruce Lee asks, "What do I do these days?")

1390
00:47:56,700 --> 00:47:57,945
You are on hiatus.

1391
00:47:59,439 --> 00:48:01,574
(I am on hiatus?)

1392
00:48:02,140 --> 00:48:04,340
- Ji Hyo! - It's true!

1393
00:48:04,340 --> 00:48:05,939
What else am I supposed to say?

1394
00:48:05,939 --> 00:48:07,510
- That's too much. - He is on a hiatus.

1395
00:48:07,510 --> 00:48:08,649
Am I alive?

1396
00:48:08,649 --> 00:48:11,209
Oh, I passed away.

1397
00:48:11,209 --> 00:48:12,525
I answered that question.

1398
00:48:12,579 --> 00:48:14,720
- Didn't you ask that question? - Didn't you know?

1399
00:48:14,720 --> 00:48:16,249
- I answered that question. - I don't remember.

1400
00:48:16,249 --> 00:48:17,519
I was sullen...

1401
00:48:17,519 --> 00:48:18,519
because everyone ignored my question.

1402
00:48:18,519 --> 00:48:20,065
Would it be okay if I throw in a white towel?

1403
00:48:20,490 --> 00:48:22,105
- Seriously. - We have...

1404
00:48:22,129 --> 00:48:23,729
- He is really bad at this game. - We have...

1405
00:48:23,729 --> 00:48:24,829
no hope.

1406
00:48:24,829 --> 00:48:26,505
Am I a foreigner?

1407
00:48:26,999 --> 00:48:28,099
Yes, you are.

1408
00:48:28,099 --> 00:48:29,829
You should ask another question.

1409
00:48:29,829 --> 00:48:31,505
Am I a foreigner?

1410
00:48:32,099 --> 00:48:33,300
Your name sounds foreign, but...

1411
00:48:33,300 --> 00:48:34,815
I mean...

1412
00:48:35,510 --> 00:48:38,510
(He mistakenly shares a valuable piece of information.)

1413
00:48:38,510 --> 00:48:39,939
- It's a big hint. - Why did you tell her that?

1414
00:48:39,939 --> 00:48:41,255
It's a big hint.

1415
00:48:42,550 --> 00:48:44,479
I made a mistake.

1416
00:48:44,479 --> 00:48:46,749
- Ji Hyo, use this hint. - I made a mistake.

1417
00:48:46,749 --> 00:48:48,094
I am a woman...

1418
00:48:48,720 --> 00:48:50,519
whose name sounds foreign, right?

1419
00:48:50,519 --> 00:48:52,220
Seok Jin tried to twist his answer.

1420
00:48:52,220 --> 00:48:53,289
Let me answer.

1421
00:48:53,289 --> 00:48:55,204
(What will be Ji Hyo's answer?)

1422
00:48:56,270 --> 00:48:58,069
whose name sounds foreign, right?

1423
00:48:58,069 --> 00:48:59,770
Seok Jin tried to twist his answer.

1424
00:48:59,770 --> 00:49:00,839
Let me answer.

1425
00:49:00,839 --> 00:49:02,754
(What will be Ji Hyo's answer?)

1426
00:49:02,810 --> 00:49:03,940
IU.

1427
00:49:03,940 --> 00:49:05,440
(Correct)

1428
00:49:05,440 --> 00:49:06,580
Correct.

1429
00:49:06,580 --> 00:49:07,609
Okay!

1430
00:49:07,609 --> 00:49:08,684
(Ji Hyo places 2nd.)

1431
00:49:08,710 --> 00:49:11,294
(He hits her because he is annoyed.)

1432
00:49:11,949 --> 00:49:13,925
- Okay. - That was too easy.

1433
00:49:14,120 --> 00:49:15,649
- It couldn't be helped. - Bruce Lee.

1434
00:49:15,649 --> 00:49:17,160
It couldn't be helped.

1435
00:49:17,160 --> 00:49:18,620
Seok Jin wouldn't have been able to get it right.

1436
00:49:18,620 --> 00:49:20,735
- I thought it was a Westerner. - He didn't have a chance.

1437
00:49:21,489 --> 00:49:22,629
Now, pick...

1438
00:49:22,629 --> 00:49:23,874
- the next set of members. - I will go next.

1439
00:49:24,299 --> 00:49:25,299
Sit down.

1440
00:49:25,299 --> 00:49:27,170
(Jung Min is Sejong the Great.)

1441
00:49:27,170 --> 00:49:30,745
(So Min is Cinderella.)

1442
00:49:30,899 --> 00:49:32,069
Who wants to ask a question first?

1443
00:49:32,069 --> 00:49:33,985
(Se Chan is...)

1444
00:49:34,339 --> 00:49:37,379
(Ah Gwi?)

1445
00:49:37,379 --> 00:49:39,140
(Ah Gwi is a character in his 40s or 50s...)

1446
00:49:39,140 --> 00:49:40,879
(with a knack for gambling and a coldhearted personality.)

1447
00:49:40,879 --> 00:49:42,719
(Will Se Chan be able to get it right?)

1448
00:49:42,719 --> 00:49:44,454
Who wants to ask a question first?

1449
00:49:44,620 --> 00:49:46,219
- All right. - So Min, you can go first.

1450
00:49:46,219 --> 00:49:47,365
All right.

1451
00:49:47,850 --> 00:49:48,890
Am I alive?

1452
00:49:48,890 --> 00:49:51,120
(Cinderella asks, "Am I alive?")

1453
00:49:51,120 --> 00:49:52,489
(She isn't a real person.)

1454
00:49:52,489 --> 00:49:53,830
It's hard to say.

1455
00:49:53,830 --> 00:49:55,259
- Is it hard to say? - It's really hard to say.

1456
00:49:55,259 --> 00:49:56,830
- What's hard to say? - It's not hard to say.

1457
00:49:56,830 --> 00:49:58,299
Can your answer be like,

1458
00:49:58,299 --> 00:50:00,129
- "You are alive in my heart"? - That's right.

1459
00:50:00,129 --> 00:50:01,170
Of course.

1460
00:50:01,170 --> 00:50:02,569
- You are alive... - That's the perfect answer.

1461
00:50:02,569 --> 00:50:04,199
- You are alive in our hearts. - You are alive in our hearts.

1462
00:50:04,199 --> 00:50:05,644
You are forever alive in my heart.

1463
00:50:06,440 --> 00:50:08,485
Am I not a person? I'm a person, right?

1464
00:50:09,069 --> 00:50:10,480
Would you go out with me?

1465
00:50:10,480 --> 00:50:12,655
- What? - Would you go out with me?

1466
00:50:12,779 --> 00:50:15,080
Gosh, if you would give me a chance...

1467
00:50:15,080 --> 00:50:17,024
(He grabs his chance.)

1468
00:50:17,750 --> 00:50:19,425
I would go for it.

1469
00:50:19,920 --> 00:50:22,449
- Anyone would go for it. - I would go for it.

1470
00:50:22,449 --> 00:50:24,660
- Anyone would go for it. - Even if I spend all of my money...

1471
00:50:24,660 --> 00:50:26,230
It's strange to see Se Chan say that...

1472
00:50:26,230 --> 00:50:27,359
to So Min.

1473
00:50:27,359 --> 00:50:28,934
I would go for it.

1474
00:50:29,160 --> 00:50:30,460
Am I a man?

1475
00:50:30,460 --> 00:50:32,104
- Yes. - Yes.

1476
00:50:32,330 --> 00:50:34,029
Am I...

1477
00:50:34,029 --> 00:50:35,830
in the entertainment business?

1478
00:50:35,830 --> 00:50:37,845
(Ah Gwi asks, "Am I in the entertainment business?")

1479
00:50:38,640 --> 00:50:39,940
You know,

1480
00:50:39,940 --> 00:50:41,945
- it's hard to say. - That's a bit...

1481
00:50:42,440 --> 00:50:44,055
Was that a sharp question?

1482
00:50:45,080 --> 00:50:46,480
I don't know which side of you I should focus on.

1483
00:50:46,480 --> 00:50:48,779
- Is it hard to say? - To be honest... No, no.

1484
00:50:48,779 --> 00:50:50,620
You have nothing to do with the entertainment business.

1485
00:50:50,620 --> 00:50:51,879
I have nothing to do with it.

1486
00:50:51,879 --> 00:50:53,420
- You have nothing to do with it. - He is a separate character.

1487
00:50:53,420 --> 00:50:55,350
- Thus, - That's right.

1488
00:50:55,350 --> 00:50:56,560
- he has nothing to do with it. - That's right.

1489
00:50:56,560 --> 00:50:57,790
He isn't in this industry.

1490
00:50:57,790 --> 00:50:58,965
Really?

1491
00:50:59,790 --> 00:51:02,164
- Jung Min, ask a question. - Ask a question.

1492
00:51:02,859 --> 00:51:04,000
Am I a character?

1493
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:05,429
(Sejong the Great asks, "Am I a character?")

1494
00:51:05,429 --> 00:51:07,929
You are a character at times.

1495
00:51:07,929 --> 00:51:09,940
- Yes. - There could be merchandise.

1496
00:51:09,940 --> 00:51:11,739
- That's right. - Don't give away too much.

1497
00:51:11,739 --> 00:51:13,670
I have a hunch.

1498
00:51:13,670 --> 00:51:15,370
I think this question will tell me everything.

1499
00:51:15,370 --> 00:51:16,410
(He is certain.)

1500
00:51:16,410 --> 00:51:17,839
I think this question will tell me everything.

1501
00:51:17,839 --> 00:51:19,580
(What is Se Chan's crucial question?)

1502
00:51:19,580 --> 00:51:21,024
I am popular these days, right?

1503
00:51:21,250 --> 00:51:22,425
No.

1504
00:51:23,219 --> 00:51:24,679
(He doesn't have a clue.)

1505
00:51:24,679 --> 00:51:26,620
No. No.

1506
00:51:26,620 --> 00:51:29,394
It was so funny to see you act like you have a hunch.

1507
00:51:30,620 --> 00:51:31,690
I must be popular these days.

1508
00:51:31,690 --> 00:51:33,004
- No. - It was so...

1509
00:51:33,230 --> 00:51:35,529
- He makes me laugh. - Se Chan, you were an eyesore.

1510
00:51:35,529 --> 00:51:37,529
Our faces are turning red.

1511
00:51:37,529 --> 00:51:39,035
Okay. The answer is no.

1512
00:51:39,060 --> 00:51:40,629
I thought I had a hunch.

1513
00:51:40,629 --> 00:51:43,500
In my case, what is my nationality?

1514
00:51:43,500 --> 00:51:45,440
- Nationality? - Which country am I from?

1515
00:51:45,440 --> 00:51:46,569
- It's important. - That's right.

1516
00:51:46,569 --> 00:51:48,414
It's a sharp question.

1517
00:51:48,509 --> 00:51:50,509
- Can I make a guess? - Yes.

1518
00:51:50,509 --> 00:51:52,679
I think you are British.

1519
00:51:52,679 --> 00:51:54,055
(That's my guess.)

1520
00:51:54,850 --> 00:51:56,080
(Is that because she uses English in the animated movie?)

1521
00:51:56,080 --> 00:51:57,149
Say what you think.

1522
00:51:57,149 --> 00:51:58,649
- That's what I think. - That's right.

1523
00:51:58,649 --> 00:51:59,649
I think you are British.

1524
00:51:59,649 --> 00:52:00,649
What do you think?

1525
00:52:00,649 --> 00:52:02,224
I think...

1526
00:52:03,160 --> 00:52:05,120
- she is Norwegian. - Our answers are close.

1527
00:52:05,120 --> 00:52:06,604
- Really? - Norwegian?

1528
00:52:06,690 --> 00:52:08,660
Is it Xylitol Gum? "Hyva, hyva."

1529
00:52:08,660 --> 00:52:09,730
(Shouting)

1530
00:52:09,730 --> 00:52:11,600
- Ignore that. - Stop it.

1531
00:52:11,600 --> 00:52:13,569
(Hyva, hyva?)

1532
00:52:13,569 --> 00:52:15,100
Don't get fooled.

1533
00:52:15,100 --> 00:52:16,899
- Don't get fooled. - Don't pay any attention to him.

1534
00:52:16,899 --> 00:52:18,239
Don't get fooled.

1535
00:52:18,239 --> 00:52:19,509
Haha is lying...

1536
00:52:19,509 --> 00:52:21,285
- when he does something like that. - Don't look at him.

1537
00:52:21,310 --> 00:52:23,285
- Don't get fooled. - Don't pay any attention to him.

1538
00:52:23,379 --> 00:52:25,385
Don't... Don't pay any attention to me.

1539
00:52:25,540 --> 00:52:27,555
Jung Min, ask a question.

1540
00:52:28,649 --> 00:52:30,449
I am...

1541
00:52:30,449 --> 00:52:32,620
(I am...)

1542
00:52:32,620 --> 00:52:34,664
Did you say I am a celebrity?

1543
00:52:34,750 --> 00:52:36,865
He lost his focus.

1544
00:52:36,890 --> 00:52:39,095
- Jung Min, what are you doing? - Jung Min, eat some chocolate.

1545
00:52:39,219 --> 00:52:40,830
- Jung Min. - Would you like some chocolate?

1546
00:52:40,830 --> 00:52:41,965
(Okay, okay.)

1547
00:52:42,390 --> 00:52:44,460
Am I... Am I a person?

1548
00:52:44,460 --> 00:52:45,500
- Yes. - Yes.

1549
00:52:45,500 --> 00:52:46,929
- My goodness. - Of course, you are.

1550
00:52:46,929 --> 00:52:48,230
Jung Min, what are you doing?

1551
00:52:48,230 --> 00:52:49,600
- What is your problem? - Seriously.

1552
00:52:49,600 --> 00:52:52,339
- He isn't as smart as I thought. - I know.

1553
00:52:52,339 --> 00:52:53,969
- Go and wash your face. - Everyone is a person.

1554
00:52:53,969 --> 00:52:55,239
Your eyes are unfocused.

1555
00:52:55,239 --> 00:52:56,980
- He isn't as smart as I thought. - Hey.

1556
00:52:56,980 --> 00:52:58,509
Everyone is a person.

1557
00:52:58,509 --> 00:52:59,580
You know,

1558
00:52:59,580 --> 00:53:02,124
I had intentionally saved him for later.

1559
00:53:02,679 --> 00:53:04,350
- All right. - I was mistaken.

1560
00:53:04,350 --> 00:53:08,649
I made a mistake earlier, but I have a good hunch now.

1561
00:53:08,649 --> 00:53:09,765
You have a good hunch.

1562
00:53:10,219 --> 00:53:11,489
Let's focus.

1563
00:53:11,489 --> 00:53:12,560
Please ask...

1564
00:53:12,560 --> 00:53:13,660
- a sharp question. - Please refresh us.

1565
00:53:13,660 --> 00:53:15,089
- Please refresh us. - Okay.

1566
00:53:15,089 --> 00:53:16,230
(One question that will refresh the frustrated onlookers' hearts)

1567
00:53:16,230 --> 00:53:17,504
I am young, right?

1568
00:53:17,600 --> 00:53:18,830
No.

1569
00:53:18,830 --> 00:53:20,399
(I am young, right?)

1570
00:53:20,399 --> 00:53:21,604
No.

1571
00:53:22,100 --> 00:53:24,239
- You aren't young. - You were young once.

1572
00:53:24,239 --> 00:53:25,469
That's right.

1573
00:53:25,469 --> 00:53:26,509
(He doesn't have a clue.)

1574
00:53:26,509 --> 00:53:27,940
- He doesn't have a clue. - Seriously.

1575
00:53:27,940 --> 00:53:29,710
- What is he doing? - Seriously.

1576
00:53:29,710 --> 00:53:31,080
He doesn't have a clue.

1577
00:53:31,080 --> 00:53:32,414
- What are you doing? - He doesn't have a clue.

1578
00:53:32,810 --> 00:53:34,410
Give me two turns.

1579
00:53:34,410 --> 00:53:36,250
(Okay!)

1580
00:53:36,250 --> 00:53:38,779
After two turns, I will give the right answer.

1581
00:53:38,779 --> 00:53:40,089
Just you wait.

1582
00:53:40,089 --> 00:53:41,390
- Give me two turns. - He is ridiculous.

1583
00:53:41,390 --> 00:53:43,064
It's so funny to see him pretend to be sharp.

1584
00:53:43,890 --> 00:53:45,660
- Okay. - You are nowhere near the answer.

1585
00:53:45,660 --> 00:53:47,060
- Jung Min, ask a question. - Ask a question.

1586
00:53:47,060 --> 00:53:48,865
- What's my profession? - There you go!

1587
00:53:49,029 --> 00:53:50,575
You write.

1588
00:53:51,299 --> 00:53:53,305
- I write? - Yes.

1589
00:53:53,629 --> 00:53:55,805
Here is the thing.

1590
00:53:55,899 --> 00:53:57,140
- What people say... Jung Min? - Yes?

1591
00:53:57,140 --> 00:54:00,040
People twist the words to drive you further away...

1592
00:54:00,040 --> 00:54:01,370
- from the answer. - Really?

1593
00:54:01,370 --> 00:54:02,640
- You write. - Don't take them literally.

1594
00:54:02,640 --> 00:54:04,379
Jong Kook won't let you come back if you fail.

1595
00:54:04,379 --> 00:54:06,250
Jung Min, I will speak to you casually.

1596
00:54:06,250 --> 00:54:08,080
- Okay. - He is angry right now.

1597
00:54:08,080 --> 00:54:10,655
He is a bit annoyed. You need to concentrate.

1598
00:54:10,879 --> 00:54:12,965
Jung Min, you are doing a good job. Okay.

1599
00:54:13,390 --> 00:54:14,465
You are...

1600
00:54:15,319 --> 00:54:18,259
a high-ranking civil servant.

1601
00:54:18,259 --> 00:54:19,319
(Here is a hint.)

1602
00:54:19,319 --> 00:54:20,560
That's not half bad.

1603
00:54:20,560 --> 00:54:22,790
- I put it bluntly. - That's not half bad.

1604
00:54:22,790 --> 00:54:23,859
Listen to that answer.

1605
00:54:23,859 --> 00:54:26,029
- It's true. - Jung Min, combine the two hints.

1606
00:54:26,029 --> 00:54:27,429
That's right.

1607
00:54:27,429 --> 00:54:29,175
What do I write?

1608
00:54:29,270 --> 00:54:30,270
What do I write?

1609
00:54:30,270 --> 00:54:31,474
You write Korean.

1610
00:54:32,440 --> 00:54:34,084
- You write Korean. - What?

1611
00:54:34,109 --> 00:54:35,140
(It's a daring hint.)

1612
00:54:35,140 --> 00:54:36,215
My goodness.

1613
00:54:37,009 --> 00:54:38,839
(A high-ranking civil servant who writes Korean?)

1614
00:54:38,839 --> 00:54:41,850
- Let's go. - Jung Min, let's go.

1615
00:54:41,850 --> 00:54:43,254
Did I live back in the days?

1616
00:54:43,920 --> 00:54:44,920
- Yes. - Yes.

1617
00:54:44,920 --> 00:54:46,549
(Jung Min also figures out that he lived back in the days.)

1618
00:54:46,549 --> 00:54:48,850
(Did he figure out the answer?)

1619
00:54:48,850 --> 00:54:49,920
Han Seok Bong.

1620
00:54:49,920 --> 00:54:51,635
(The best calligrapher of Joseon, Han Seok Bong)

1621
00:54:52,060 --> 00:54:55,204
(He ruined his chance.)

1622
00:54:55,390 --> 00:54:58,135
Han Seok Bong.

1623
00:54:58,859 --> 00:55:01,504
Han Seok Bong! Han Seok Bong!

1624
00:55:01,670 --> 00:55:03,115
I can't believe him!

1625
00:55:04,140 --> 00:55:06,540
- Hey! - No, he could think that.

1626
00:55:06,540 --> 00:55:08,739
- For goodness' sake. - He could think that.

1627
00:55:08,739 --> 00:55:09,739
Did I go in the wrong direction?

1628
00:55:09,739 --> 00:55:11,009
- A high-ranking civil servant. - That's right.

1629
00:55:11,009 --> 00:55:12,949
- I gave all the hints. - The three of you...

1630
00:55:12,949 --> 00:55:14,925
should make a show.

1631
00:55:14,949 --> 00:55:16,425
This is the best.

1632
00:55:17,149 --> 00:55:18,925
- Hey. - Jung Min.

1633
00:55:19,379 --> 00:55:20,690
"The Fools' Show".

1634
00:55:20,690 --> 00:55:22,449
I will ask a question.

1635
00:55:22,449 --> 00:55:24,020
Please ask a sharp question this time.

1636
00:55:24,020 --> 00:55:26,460
I got an idea when I heard his answer.

1637
00:55:26,460 --> 00:55:29,535
- Really? - I was like, "That's right!"

1638
00:55:31,429 --> 00:55:33,170
How much do I make in a year?

1639
00:55:33,170 --> 00:55:36,245
(How much do I make in a year?)

1640
00:55:37,600 --> 00:55:39,969
- It's the worst. - It's the worst.

1641
00:55:39,969 --> 00:55:42,615
- It's the worst. - It's the worst question.

1642
00:55:42,640 --> 00:55:44,414
- What? - It's performance-based.

1643
00:55:44,580 --> 00:55:45,839
- Performance-based? - Yes.

1644
00:55:45,839 --> 00:55:46,949
Do I have a performance-based salary?

1645
00:55:46,949 --> 00:55:48,785
- For goodness' sake. - Performance-based?

1646
00:55:49,210 --> 00:55:50,949
Performance-based?

1647
00:55:50,949 --> 00:55:52,649
- Jung Min, that was a good one. - Performance-based?

1648
00:55:52,649 --> 00:55:55,489
- That was a good one. - A performance-based salary.

1649
00:55:55,489 --> 00:55:57,759
- Good job. - I have a performance-based salary.

1650
00:55:57,759 --> 00:55:59,660
- That means... - Jung Min, that was a good one.

1651
00:55:59,660 --> 00:56:01,859
It's a big hint.

1652
00:56:01,859 --> 00:56:03,460
- A performance-based is? - That's right.

1653
00:56:03,460 --> 00:56:04,460
(A performance-based salary)

1654
00:56:04,460 --> 00:56:06,230
So Min, ask a sharp question.

1655
00:56:06,230 --> 00:56:08,299
Is there a song I sing?

1656
00:56:08,299 --> 00:56:10,799
Is there a song about me?

1657
00:56:10,799 --> 00:56:12,144
I have heard it.

1658
00:56:12,239 --> 00:56:13,739
- There is a song. - Please sing it.

1659
00:56:13,739 --> 00:56:15,670
- You can hum it. - That's right.

1660
00:56:15,670 --> 00:56:16,910
I don't know the song.

1661
00:56:16,910 --> 00:56:18,015
I will sing it.

1662
00:56:18,239 --> 00:56:22,850
(Some time)

1663
00:56:22,850 --> 00:56:23,949
Hey!

1664
00:56:23,949 --> 00:56:25,920
What? What?

1665
00:56:25,920 --> 00:56:27,520
What? I was singing the song.

1666
00:56:27,520 --> 00:56:29,120
If you don't know it, just say so.

1667
00:56:29,120 --> 00:56:31,060
- If you don't know it, just say so. - I was singing the song.

1668
00:56:31,060 --> 00:56:33,164
If you sing it as you please...

1669
00:56:33,259 --> 00:56:34,259
I was singing the song.

1670
00:56:34,259 --> 00:56:35,790
Where did "Some time" come from?

1671
00:56:35,790 --> 00:56:38,660
Kwang Soo, sit down.

1672
00:56:38,660 --> 00:56:39,770
Let me answer.

1673
00:56:39,770 --> 00:56:41,270
- A high-ranking civil servant. - Cinderella?

1674
00:56:41,270 --> 00:56:43,245
(Cinderella?)

1675
00:56:43,770 --> 00:56:45,069
I can't believe it.

1676
00:56:45,069 --> 00:56:46,410
Cinderella.

1677
00:56:46,410 --> 00:56:47,515
Correct.

1678
00:56:47,670 --> 00:56:50,354
(Team Blue gets 3 points.)

1679
00:56:50,739 --> 00:56:52,509
- How did you know? - It just occurred to me.

1680
00:56:52,509 --> 00:56:53,624
My goodness.

1681
00:56:53,910 --> 00:56:55,149
How did you know?

1682
00:56:55,149 --> 00:56:56,679
It just occurred to me.

1683
00:56:56,679 --> 00:56:58,319
Jung Min, let's place second.

1684
00:56:58,319 --> 00:56:59,825
- Let's place second. - Jung Min.

1685
00:56:59,850 --> 00:57:01,195
You are almost there.

1686
00:57:01,219 --> 00:57:02,325
Am I alive?

1687
00:57:02,420 --> 00:57:03,660
- No. - I am dead.

1688
00:57:03,660 --> 00:57:05,420
You know you lived back in the days!

1689
00:57:05,420 --> 00:57:07,465
(You know you lived back in the days!)

1690
00:57:07,660 --> 00:57:08,805
Jong Kook.

1691
00:57:09,330 --> 00:57:10,500
He already said you lived back in the days!

1692
00:57:10,500 --> 00:57:11,560
It was basically the same question.

1693
00:57:11,560 --> 00:57:13,670
- Jung Min, don't lose to Se Chan. - You are almost there.

1694
00:57:13,670 --> 00:57:15,799
Jung Min, I told you everything.

1695
00:57:15,799 --> 00:57:17,339
- You are almost there. - Let me answer.

1696
00:57:17,339 --> 00:57:19,670
- Sejong the Great. - All right.

1697
00:57:19,670 --> 00:57:21,509
(Jung Min beats Se Chan and gets 1 point.)

1698
00:57:21,509 --> 00:57:22,910
So Min shouldn't have said anything.

1699
00:57:22,910 --> 00:57:25,310
- All right, Jung Min. - You almost had it.

1700
00:57:25,310 --> 00:57:26,509
- You could have won. - Look at yours.

1701
00:57:26,509 --> 00:57:28,555
- You surprised us. - Look at yours.

1702
00:57:29,649 --> 00:57:30,679
Ah Gwi?

1703
00:57:30,679 --> 00:57:31,850
(He never imagined it.)

1704
00:57:31,850 --> 00:57:34,865
How are we supposed to know how much he makes in a year?

1705
00:57:36,020 --> 00:57:38,120
That's right.

1706
00:57:38,120 --> 00:57:39,759
(After the 2nd and 3rd round)

1707
00:57:39,759 --> 00:57:41,330
All right. This is the last round.

1708
00:57:41,330 --> 00:57:43,660
I won't joke around this time.

1709
00:57:43,660 --> 00:57:46,235
I will show you what I can do, Jong Kook.

1710
00:57:47,000 --> 00:57:48,104
Okay.

1711
00:57:48,500 --> 00:57:50,239
(Jae Seok is Count Dracula.)

1712
00:57:50,239 --> 00:57:51,969
(Count Dracula is a fictional character...)

1713
00:57:51,969 --> 00:57:53,239
(who was based on a Romanian king.)

1714
00:57:53,239 --> 00:57:54,739
(He is a rich man...)

1715
00:57:54,739 --> 00:57:56,184
(who lives the life of a vampire at night.)

1716
00:57:56,339 --> 00:57:57,940
My goodness.

1717
00:57:57,940 --> 00:58:00,850
(Se Chan is Freddie Mercury.)

1718
00:58:00,850 --> 00:58:03,724
(He is receiving more love thanks to "Bohemian Rhapsody".)

1719
00:58:04,250 --> 00:58:06,279
- This is... - Go, go, go! Look.

1720
00:58:06,279 --> 00:58:08,124
- Look at Se Chan. - You can do it.

1721
00:58:08,449 --> 00:58:10,465
- Kwang Soo. - Let's go, Kwang Soo.

1722
00:58:10,560 --> 00:58:12,520
- Let's place 1st. - If we place 1st this time,

1723
00:58:12,520 --> 00:58:13,690
we will receive the coins.

1724
00:58:13,690 --> 00:58:14,960
Let's play rock-paper-scissors.

1725
00:58:14,960 --> 00:58:16,060
- Rock-paper-scissors! - Rock-paper-scissors!

1726
00:58:16,060 --> 00:58:17,429
- Rock-paper-scissors! - Rock-paper-scissors!

1727
00:58:17,429 --> 00:58:18,735
I'll go first.

1728
00:58:19,770 --> 00:58:20,770
- What? - You lost.

1729
00:58:20,770 --> 00:58:22,245
- I will ask... - Why would you do that?

1730
00:58:22,500 --> 00:58:23,670
- We never decided on it. - The winner goes first.

1731
00:58:23,670 --> 00:58:25,040
We never decided that the winner goes first.

1732
00:58:25,040 --> 00:58:26,969
All right. Let's go in this direction.

1733
00:58:26,969 --> 00:58:27,969
Okay.

1734
00:58:27,969 --> 00:58:29,184
In this direction?

1735
00:58:29,670 --> 00:58:30,679
Shouldn't it be clockwise?

1736
00:58:30,679 --> 00:58:32,940
No, we are righthanded. We should go in this direction.

1737
00:58:32,940 --> 00:58:34,250
Do you want to go first? Go ahead.

1738
00:58:34,250 --> 00:58:35,885
- Go first. - Okay.

1739
00:58:36,379 --> 00:58:37,649
Am I alive?

1740
00:58:37,649 --> 00:58:40,325
(Jae Seok asks, "Am I alive?")

1741
00:58:41,690 --> 00:58:43,690
(He is well and alive before your eyes.)

1742
00:58:43,690 --> 00:58:45,865
- You are alive. - Yes.

1743
00:58:46,219 --> 00:58:48,334
- You are alive. - You are alive.

1744
00:58:49,390 --> 00:58:50,960
Read the first letter.

1745
00:58:50,960 --> 00:58:52,799
(Read the first letter.)

1746
00:58:52,799 --> 00:58:54,230
- For goodness' sake. - What?

1747
00:58:54,230 --> 00:58:56,129
- You can't do that. - What?

1748
00:58:56,129 --> 00:58:57,770
- Who am I? - Read the first letter.

1749
00:58:57,770 --> 00:58:59,985
- Then I could ask the same thing. - Read it.

1750
00:59:00,410 --> 00:59:02,440
Asking you to read the entire thing would be against the rules.

1751
00:59:02,440 --> 00:59:03,580
Just read one letter.

1752
00:59:03,580 --> 00:59:06,754
- I will give you a crucial hint. - Okay.

1753
00:59:08,250 --> 00:59:10,624
- If I tell you the first letter, - What?

1754
00:59:10,920 --> 00:59:13,589
you will be able to guess the full name.

1755
00:59:13,589 --> 00:59:14,894
The full name.

1756
00:59:14,920 --> 00:59:17,020
Then I will cancel this question.

1757
00:59:17,020 --> 00:59:18,765
(Is that so?)

1758
00:59:19,120 --> 00:59:20,390
- What? - You can't cancel it.

1759
00:59:20,390 --> 00:59:22,160
- What is your problem? - You didn't read the first letter.

1760
00:59:22,160 --> 00:59:24,104
- Don't be ridiculous. - In that case,

1761
00:59:24,259 --> 00:59:25,405
what's my profession?

1762
00:59:25,799 --> 00:59:27,374
- Your profession? - Yes.

1763
00:59:28,029 --> 00:59:30,170
I will know the answer after a few questions.

1764
00:59:30,170 --> 00:59:31,515
- Your profession? - Yes.

1765
00:59:31,699 --> 00:59:33,814
You run a business.

1766
00:59:34,009 --> 00:59:36,015
- No, he doesn't. - He does too!

1767
00:59:36,140 --> 00:59:37,580
- What? - He doesn't run a business.

1768
00:59:37,580 --> 00:59:40,410
I will end you if I later find that this information is wrong.

1769
00:59:40,410 --> 00:59:41,624
I can tell you.

1770
00:59:42,109 --> 00:59:44,850
- You are rich. You are rich. - That's right.

1771
00:59:44,850 --> 00:59:46,420
You do something bad.

1772
00:59:46,420 --> 00:59:47,420
- I do? - Yes.

1773
00:59:47,420 --> 00:59:49,520
- I do something bad? - Stop sharing information.

1774
00:59:49,520 --> 00:59:50,759
Why are you telling him everything?

1775
00:59:50,759 --> 00:59:51,759
Each question is taking an hour.

1776
00:59:51,759 --> 00:59:54,004
I will ask a question. What's my profession?

1777
00:59:54,529 --> 00:59:56,759
- You are... - It's very clear.

1778
00:59:56,759 --> 00:59:57,859
in a popular field.

1779
00:59:57,859 --> 01:00:00,069
That's not a profession. Am I a singer or...

1780
01:00:00,069 --> 01:00:01,569
You can't word a question that way!

1781
01:00:01,569 --> 01:00:03,170
(You can't word a question that way!)

1782
01:00:03,170 --> 01:00:04,170
(What?)

1783
01:00:04,170 --> 01:00:06,399
What did I do?

1784
01:00:06,399 --> 01:00:07,569
You can't do that.

1785
01:00:07,569 --> 01:00:08,569
What's my profession?

1786
01:00:08,569 --> 01:00:10,480
- A celebrity. - A celebrity?

1787
01:00:10,480 --> 01:00:11,679
Am I a singer?

1788
01:00:11,679 --> 01:00:12,739
(He has a hunch.)

1789
01:00:12,739 --> 01:00:13,850
(Hesitant)

1790
01:00:13,850 --> 01:00:15,055
The thing is...

1791
01:00:16,480 --> 01:00:18,695
- Personally, - Go on.

1792
01:00:19,149 --> 01:00:21,995
I have seen him sing.

1793
01:00:22,219 --> 01:00:24,595
- Is that allowed? - This is driving me crazy.

1794
01:00:26,160 --> 01:00:28,230
"I have seen him sing."

1795
01:00:28,230 --> 01:00:29,960
Seok Jin, are you going to drink coffee?

1796
01:00:29,960 --> 01:00:31,429
(What?)

1797
01:00:31,429 --> 01:00:33,770
(Am I seeing things?)

1798
01:00:33,770 --> 01:00:35,469
He wanted a cup of coffee.

1799
01:00:35,469 --> 01:00:36,745
(Is he getting coffee in the middle of the shoot?)

1800
01:00:36,770 --> 01:00:38,600
- What are you doing? - That was so sudden.

1801
01:00:38,600 --> 01:00:39,799
- Keep going. - That was so sudden.

1802
01:00:39,799 --> 01:00:41,469
- What was that? - Don't mind me.

1803
01:00:41,469 --> 01:00:43,640
- I thought I was seeing things. - What are you doing?

1804
01:00:43,640 --> 01:00:46,649
- What are you doing? - We are having a shoot!

1805
01:00:46,649 --> 01:00:48,750
How could you get coffee in the middle of the shoot?

1806
01:00:48,750 --> 01:00:50,925
Just keep going!

1807
01:00:51,049 --> 01:00:53,325
(The members of Running Man are strange.)

1808
01:00:53,790 --> 01:00:54,920
Have you seen me sing?

1809
01:00:54,920 --> 01:00:56,960
Just tell me that.

1810
01:00:56,960 --> 01:00:58,560
- I have seen you sing. - That gives you...

1811
01:00:58,560 --> 01:01:00,589
the answer.

1812
01:01:00,589 --> 01:01:01,589
I am a singer. Okay.

1813
01:01:01,589 --> 01:01:02,790
- I have a question. - Okay.

1814
01:01:02,790 --> 01:01:03,799
Tell me...

1815
01:01:03,799 --> 01:01:05,160
(I have a question.)

1816
01:01:05,160 --> 01:01:07,069
if you have met me.

1817
01:01:07,069 --> 01:01:08,699
(Jae Seok asks, "Tell me if you have met me.")

1818
01:01:08,699 --> 01:01:09,845
I haven't.

1819
01:01:12,069 --> 01:01:13,814
(Thinking)

1820
01:01:14,640 --> 01:01:16,485
Why won't he answer?

1821
01:01:16,640 --> 01:01:17,739
Hurry up and tell him.

1822
01:01:17,739 --> 01:01:18,779
Answer the question.

1823
01:01:18,779 --> 01:01:20,250
Tell him honestly.

1824
01:01:20,250 --> 01:01:21,410
- Have you met me? - Hurry up.

1825
01:01:21,410 --> 01:01:23,149
- Yes, I have. - Have you met me?

1826
01:01:23,149 --> 01:01:24,555
Yes, I have.

1827
01:01:24,679 --> 01:01:25,850
(Does that mean I am a celebrity?)

1828
01:01:25,850 --> 01:01:28,390
What's my nickname?

1829
01:01:28,390 --> 01:01:30,259
- What do you think is my nickname? - It's a sharp question.

1830
01:01:30,259 --> 01:01:32,290
- Your answer must make sense. - It's a sharp question.

1831
01:01:32,290 --> 01:01:33,660
- Your answer must make sense. - It could be...

1832
01:01:33,660 --> 01:01:35,330
a nickname from childhood.

1833
01:01:35,330 --> 01:01:36,434
What's my nickname?

1834
01:01:36,929 --> 01:01:38,874
- I don't know. - I think it's Tiny.

1835
01:01:39,330 --> 01:01:41,170
- Tiny? - Yes, Tiny.

1836
01:01:41,170 --> 01:01:43,799
(How is my nickname Tiny?)

1837
01:01:43,799 --> 01:01:45,799
Tell the truth!

1838
01:01:45,799 --> 01:01:48,310
- That's how he is called. - Yes.

1839
01:01:48,310 --> 01:01:51,710
I have heard that nickname.

1840
01:01:51,710 --> 01:01:55,009
- All right. Let me ask a question. - Do I have a tiny body part?

1841
01:01:55,009 --> 01:01:56,580
- Is it about a body part? - It's not like that.

1842
01:01:56,580 --> 01:01:57,954
It could be about their height.

1843
01:01:58,219 --> 01:02:00,219
- He doesn't know. - Tiny?

1844
01:02:00,219 --> 01:02:01,294
Let me answer!

1845
01:02:02,920 --> 01:02:04,589
- Haha. - You jerk!

1846
01:02:04,589 --> 01:02:06,219
(Haha)

1847
01:02:06,219 --> 01:02:07,429
(Haha gets dragged into this.)

1848
01:02:07,429 --> 01:02:08,929
That's right. That's right.

1849
01:02:08,929 --> 01:02:10,035
That came out of nowhere.

1850
01:02:10,199 --> 01:02:12,129
- If my nickname is Tiny... - Don't be like that.

1851
01:02:12,129 --> 01:02:13,870
I was just thinking about the nickname.

1852
01:02:13,870 --> 01:02:15,600
I can't believe you.

1853
01:02:15,600 --> 01:02:18,069
- I will give you a hint. - Okay.

1854
01:02:18,069 --> 01:02:19,069
Sticky Rice.

1855
01:02:19,069 --> 01:02:20,310
Sticky Rice.

1856
01:02:20,310 --> 01:02:21,540
(Does Jae Seok have that nickname?)

1857
01:02:21,540 --> 01:02:22,739
- Sticky Rice. - That's right.

1858
01:02:22,739 --> 01:02:24,540
- I have heard of it. - Why Sticky Rice?

1859
01:02:24,540 --> 01:02:26,509
- He was called that for a while. - Sticky Rice and Tiny.

1860
01:02:26,509 --> 01:02:27,850
- Sticky Rice? - That's right.

1861
01:02:27,850 --> 01:02:29,084
Tiny Sticky Rice?

1862
01:02:30,120 --> 01:02:32,655
All right. What do I wear?

1863
01:02:33,489 --> 01:02:36,589
(It's a sharp question about Count Dracula's attire.)

1864
01:02:36,589 --> 01:02:38,934
You wear something like Song Hae's outfit.

1865
01:02:39,560 --> 01:02:41,230
You wear something like Song Hae's outfit.

1866
01:02:41,230 --> 01:02:43,129
(Something like Song Hae's outfit?)

1867
01:02:43,129 --> 01:02:44,160
Song Hae?

1868
01:02:44,160 --> 01:02:45,699
Isn't that right?

1869
01:02:45,699 --> 01:02:48,429
Something like Song Hae's outfit?

1870
01:02:48,429 --> 01:02:50,540
- Is there a certain style? - Well...

1871
01:02:50,540 --> 01:02:52,699
Tell me what kind of clothes I wear.

1872
01:02:52,699 --> 01:02:54,469
You wear oversized clothes.

1873
01:02:54,469 --> 01:02:55,469
- Oversized clothes? - Yes.

1874
01:02:55,469 --> 01:02:56,940
(You wear oversized clothes.)

1875
01:02:56,940 --> 01:02:58,679
(Oversized clothes?)

1876
01:02:58,679 --> 01:02:59,679
That's right.

1877
01:02:59,679 --> 01:03:01,750
He does wear oversized clothes.

1878
01:03:01,750 --> 01:03:03,520
- All right. - Oversized clothes!

1879
01:03:03,520 --> 01:03:04,549
Oversized clothes!

1880
01:03:04,549 --> 01:03:06,149
He said oversized clothes!

1881
01:03:06,149 --> 01:03:07,290
Let me ask a question.

1882
01:03:07,290 --> 01:03:10,765
Sing a line of my famous song.

1883
01:03:10,960 --> 01:03:12,920
(This is a disaster.)

1884
01:03:12,920 --> 01:03:14,560
It's a good one.

1885
01:03:14,560 --> 01:03:17,374
You have to get the melody right.

1886
01:03:17,660 --> 01:03:19,604
You can go first.

1887
01:03:20,600 --> 01:03:22,529
(Running Man)

1888
01:03:22,529 --> 01:03:24,040
Running Man?

1889
01:03:24,040 --> 01:03:25,069
What?

1890
01:03:25,069 --> 01:03:27,609
(A famous song by Freddie Mercury, "Running Man")

1891
01:03:27,609 --> 01:03:28,609
What?

1892
01:03:28,609 --> 01:03:30,140
What was that?

1893
01:03:30,140 --> 01:03:31,640
Sing the lyrics.

1894
01:03:31,640 --> 01:03:33,850
- I sang the part I remember. - You sang that song.

1895
01:03:33,850 --> 01:03:35,949
- You know the song, right? - It's that song.

1896
01:03:35,949 --> 01:03:37,120
- I sang it. - That's right.

1897
01:03:37,120 --> 01:03:39,624
- I was going to sing that part. - Really?

1898
01:03:40,489 --> 01:03:42,724
- We heard it. - Okay.

1899
01:03:43,920 --> 01:03:46,589
(Safe)

1900
01:03:46,589 --> 01:03:48,859
(Hey, yo)

1901
01:03:48,859 --> 01:03:50,129
- "Hey, yo"? - Does that song really exist?

1902
01:03:50,129 --> 01:03:51,460
Hey, yo

1903
01:03:51,460 --> 01:03:53,770
(Does Freddie Mercury have that kind of a song?)

1904
01:03:53,770 --> 01:03:55,104
- "Hey, yo"? - "Hey, yo"?

1905
01:03:56,069 --> 01:03:57,699
(Hey, yo)

1906
01:03:57,699 --> 01:03:58,845
- "Hey, yo"? - "Hey, yo"?

1907
01:03:59,500 --> 01:04:00,540
Isn't it that song?

1908
01:04:00,540 --> 01:04:02,469
(Isn't it the line that symbolizes the singer, "Ay-oh"?)

1909
01:04:02,469 --> 01:04:04,279
He sang it well.

1910
01:04:04,279 --> 01:04:05,679
- Okay. - Kwang Soo told him everything.

1911
01:04:05,679 --> 01:04:07,580
- It's a very nice hint. - I am almost there.

1912
01:04:07,580 --> 01:04:09,509
I am almost there.

1913
01:04:09,509 --> 01:04:10,995
What's my nationality?

1914
01:04:11,620 --> 01:04:14,024
They don't know that.

1915
01:04:14,089 --> 01:04:15,719
- I don't know if it's true, - You have to tell him if you know.

1916
01:04:15,719 --> 01:04:16,794
but maybe a Czech.

1917
01:04:16,960 --> 01:04:19,219
(Dracula is Romanian but Kwang Soo thinks he's Czech.)

1918
01:04:19,219 --> 01:04:20,589
I'll ask a question.

1919
01:04:20,589 --> 01:04:21,790
Let me answer. Dracula?

1920
01:04:21,790 --> 01:04:24,199
(Let me answer! Dracula?)

1921
01:04:24,199 --> 01:04:25,560
- Hold on. - Correct.

1922
01:04:25,560 --> 01:04:27,270
(Jae Seok wins 1st place.)

1923
01:04:27,270 --> 01:04:28,600
(He took "Czech Republic" as a hint and deduced the answer.)

1924
01:04:28,600 --> 01:04:30,414
I did that to confuse him.

1925
01:04:30,770 --> 01:04:34,115
(Team White scores 1st place with 7 points.)

1926
01:04:34,170 --> 01:04:35,969
They're a singer and not in an idol group.

1927
01:04:35,969 --> 01:04:38,084
Kwang Soo, focus on the nickname.

1928
01:04:38,239 --> 01:04:40,354
- That's the most certain hint. - Sticky rice.

1929
01:04:40,679 --> 01:04:42,724
- It's my turn. - Tiny.

1930
01:04:42,810 --> 01:04:44,319
- Tiny. - Answer me.

1931
01:04:44,319 --> 01:04:45,580
How many characters is it?

1932
01:04:45,580 --> 01:04:48,620
- That's too direct. - Number of characters.

1933
01:04:48,620 --> 01:04:49,649
Number of characters?

1934
01:04:49,649 --> 01:04:51,695
- He won't know. - He won't know.

1935
01:04:51,790 --> 01:04:53,190
He won't know.

1936
01:04:53,190 --> 01:04:55,305
- Tell me the number of characters. - He won't know regardless.

1937
01:04:55,460 --> 01:04:56,560
Six characters.

1938
01:04:56,560 --> 01:04:57,805
What?

1939
01:04:57,830 --> 01:04:58,929
Six characters?

1940
01:04:58,929 --> 01:05:00,100
He's shocked.

1941
01:05:00,100 --> 01:05:01,305
See?

1942
01:05:01,699 --> 01:05:03,004
I'll ask a question.

1943
01:05:03,270 --> 01:05:05,715
Do you personally think... Be honest.

1944
01:05:06,299 --> 01:05:07,440
Is this person handsome?

1945
01:05:07,440 --> 01:05:10,040
(Am I handsome?)

1946
01:05:10,040 --> 01:05:11,754
(Give him a good answer, Se Chan.)

1947
01:05:12,109 --> 01:05:15,679
- Personally, okay? - Tell him!

1948
01:05:15,679 --> 01:05:17,354
- Do people think he's handsome? - Yes.

1949
01:05:18,049 --> 01:05:19,219
No.

1950
01:05:19,219 --> 01:05:21,564
(No.)

1951
01:05:23,620 --> 01:05:24,890
(Goodness, Se Chan.)

1952
01:05:24,890 --> 01:05:26,095
Okay!

1953
01:05:26,319 --> 01:05:29,190
People don't think this person is handsome?

1954
01:05:29,190 --> 01:05:30,334
That's enough.

1955
01:05:30,500 --> 01:05:31,699
You got everything.

1956
01:05:31,699 --> 01:05:33,305
Think about it carefully. You got everything.

1957
01:05:33,330 --> 01:05:35,374
It's an ugly, tiny, Glutinous Rice,

1958
01:05:35,699 --> 01:05:37,640
an all-around entertainer, and a man.

1959
01:05:37,640 --> 01:05:38,699
(Kwang Soo accumulated many hints.)

1960
01:05:38,699 --> 01:05:40,000
- Can I ask more... - Let me answer.

1961
01:05:40,000 --> 01:05:41,739
- What is it? - Haha.

1962
01:05:41,739 --> 01:05:43,044
I mean...

1963
01:05:43,540 --> 01:05:45,454
(Haha is surprised.)

1964
01:05:46,080 --> 01:05:48,454
No, that's not what I meant.

1965
01:05:48,810 --> 01:05:50,224
Goodness.

1966
01:05:50,319 --> 01:05:51,794
That's the answer.

1967
01:05:51,879 --> 01:05:53,750
- This can't be Haha. - He got me.

1968
01:05:53,750 --> 01:05:55,164
That's the answer.

1969
01:05:55,719 --> 01:05:56,894
Question.

1970
01:05:57,290 --> 01:05:58,690
Has he been on Running Man?

1971
01:05:58,690 --> 01:06:00,259
(Have I been on Running Man?)

1972
01:06:00,259 --> 01:06:02,004
- Yes. - He has.

1973
01:06:02,230 --> 01:06:04,060
Was he a guest?

1974
01:06:04,060 --> 01:06:05,374
- He has. - Yes.

1975
01:06:05,600 --> 01:06:07,345
It was a tiny man?

1976
01:06:07,899 --> 01:06:09,199
- He's ugly and tiny. - This is so frustrating.

1977
01:06:09,199 --> 01:06:11,600
- He's close. - He's so close.

1978
01:06:11,600 --> 01:06:12,974
Is this one person?

1979
01:06:13,569 --> 01:06:15,385
- Is it one person? - Yes.

1980
01:06:15,710 --> 01:06:16,770
- What is it? - It's one person.

1981
01:06:16,770 --> 01:06:17,810
- Wait a minute. - His name has six characters?

1982
01:06:17,810 --> 01:06:19,914
He was a guest, but Jae Seok hasn't met him?

1983
01:06:21,109 --> 01:06:22,325
No.

1984
01:06:22,679 --> 01:06:25,319
He was a guest on Running Man, but Jae Seok hasn't met him?

1985
01:06:25,319 --> 01:06:26,819
(Are you sure?)

1986
01:06:26,819 --> 01:06:27,819
Oh, gosh.

1987
01:06:27,819 --> 01:06:29,449
(The secret behind the unseen guest)

1988
01:06:29,449 --> 01:06:31,735
He was an ugly kid on Running Man,

1989
01:06:32,259 --> 01:06:33,890
but he hasn't met Jae Seok?

1990
01:06:33,890 --> 01:06:35,060
He hasn't.

1991
01:06:35,060 --> 01:06:36,230
He hasn't met me.

1992
01:06:36,230 --> 01:06:38,799
- You're so close. - Kwang Soo.

1993
01:06:38,799 --> 01:06:41,469
- Question. - Let me answer.

1994
01:06:41,469 --> 01:06:43,940
(Se Chan sounds confident.)

1995
01:06:43,940 --> 01:06:47,684
(It's one person with six characters in their name who sings "Ay-Yo".)

1996
01:06:48,009 --> 01:06:49,339
Freddie Mercury.

1997
01:06:49,339 --> 01:06:51,914
(Freddie Mercury)

1998
01:06:52,679 --> 01:06:53,779
Correct.

1999
01:06:53,779 --> 01:06:55,754
(Se Chan wins 2nd place.)

2000
01:06:56,410 --> 01:06:58,825
(He beats Kwang Soo and saves his face.)

2001
01:06:59,120 --> 01:07:01,394
How did you know?

2002
01:07:02,120 --> 01:07:03,420
Hey!

2003
01:07:03,420 --> 01:07:04,589
(Who am I?)

2004
01:07:04,589 --> 01:07:05,934
That was frustrating.

2005
01:07:06,790 --> 01:07:08,365
- Hey! - Idiot.

2006
01:07:08,489 --> 01:07:11,004
That was frustrating. Tiny.

2007
01:07:11,600 --> 01:07:13,199
I had many nicknames,

2008
01:07:13,199 --> 01:07:15,204
but when I used to eat a lot of sweet rice donuts,

2009
01:07:15,330 --> 01:07:16,704
my friend called me...

2010
01:07:17,069 --> 01:07:18,945
Sticky Rice momentarily.

2011
01:07:20,270 --> 01:07:22,084
I had no idea.

2012
01:07:22,410 --> 01:07:24,279
So first place is...

2013
01:07:24,279 --> 01:07:26,515
Jung Min, Jong Kook, Yu Hwa, and Jae Seok.

2014
01:07:26,879 --> 01:07:29,055
You'll get five R Coins.

2015
01:07:29,449 --> 01:07:32,779
As a bonus, you can pick people to steal five coins from.

2016
01:07:32,779 --> 01:07:34,164
You can steal the coins.

2017
01:07:34,850 --> 01:07:37,020
We did so well.

2018
01:07:37,020 --> 01:07:39,089
Whose coins do you want to steal?

2019
01:07:39,089 --> 01:07:41,759
- I'll steal Kwang Soo's. - Of course.

2020
01:07:41,759 --> 01:07:42,934
All four of you?

2021
01:07:43,359 --> 01:07:45,305
Hold on. Is that allowed?

2022
01:07:45,960 --> 01:07:47,929
- Is this allowed? - It's up to them.

2023
01:07:47,929 --> 01:07:49,305
I had black.

2024
01:07:49,370 --> 01:07:51,199
Will he have four left?

2025
01:07:51,199 --> 01:07:52,370
- He'll have four left? - He will.

2026
01:07:52,370 --> 01:07:53,575
Is this allowed?

2027
01:07:53,670 --> 01:07:54,870
How many will they take?

2028
01:07:54,870 --> 01:07:57,080
- He still has 4 left. - I started with 34.

2029
01:07:57,080 --> 01:08:00,055
I'll deduct 20 from Kwang Soo.

2030
01:08:00,179 --> 01:08:01,580
He lost all he had.

2031
01:08:01,580 --> 01:08:03,954
You still have four left.

2032
01:08:03,980 --> 01:08:05,894
Jae Seok has 19.

2033
01:08:05,920 --> 01:08:07,465
We'll keep moving along.

2034
01:08:07,489 --> 01:08:09,649
This is your chance to win additional coins.

2035
01:08:09,649 --> 01:08:11,719
Let's proceed with Full House.

2036
01:08:11,719 --> 01:08:13,489
Let's all go for black.

2037
01:08:13,489 --> 01:08:14,759
All black?

2038
01:08:14,759 --> 01:08:17,160
- Kwang Soo will go for black. - I'm certainly going for black.

2039
01:08:17,160 --> 01:08:18,730
Please step up one-by-one.

2040
01:08:18,730 --> 01:08:20,774
(What will the result be this time?)

2041
01:08:21,129 --> 01:08:24,115
(Se Chan picks the coin first.)

2042
01:08:25,000 --> 01:08:27,969
(Everybody picks.)

2043
01:08:27,969 --> 01:08:29,609
Okay, should we turn this around?

2044
01:08:29,609 --> 01:08:30,710
Okay!

2045
01:08:30,710 --> 01:08:31,910
- Okay! - This time,

2046
01:08:31,910 --> 01:08:34,010
- when I count down, - I won't let everybody win.

2047
01:08:34,010 --> 01:08:36,384
- raise it over your head. - Okay.

2048
01:08:37,180 --> 01:08:38,319
- 1... - 1...

2049
01:08:38,319 --> 01:08:40,019
(They can get anything from plus 20 coins to minus 5 coins.)

2050
01:08:40,019 --> 01:08:41,224
two,

2051
01:08:41,590 --> 01:08:42,819
three!

2052
01:08:42,819 --> 01:08:44,795
(What is the result?)

2053
01:08:45,090 --> 01:08:47,134
- I'm relieved. - How many blacks are there?

2054
01:08:48,130 --> 01:08:50,599
(Haha, Se Chan, Ji Hyo, and So Min for red coins)

2055
01:08:50,599 --> 01:08:53,945
(Ji Yeon, Yu Hwa, and Jong Kook for blue coins)

2056
01:08:54,670 --> 01:08:57,370
(Jung Min and Jae Seok chose black.)

2057
01:08:57,370 --> 01:08:58,470
(Kwang Soo and Seok Jin as well.)

2058
01:08:58,470 --> 01:08:59,500
- Black... - Good.

2059
01:08:59,500 --> 01:09:01,069
Since we have black,

2060
01:09:01,069 --> 01:09:02,540
blue and red will receive five coins.

2061
01:09:02,540 --> 01:09:04,239
- Okay! - Yes!

2062
01:09:04,239 --> 01:09:06,979
- Black is minus five. - Since there's black.

2063
01:09:06,979 --> 01:09:09,210
Four of you. Kwang Soo, Seok Jin,

2064
01:09:09,210 --> 01:09:12,155
- Jung Min, and Jae Seok. - He's kind.

2065
01:09:12,250 --> 01:09:14,064
Kwang Soo, you get a penalty.

2066
01:09:14,449 --> 01:09:17,019
Kwang Soo is falling to the bottom.

2067
01:09:17,019 --> 01:09:18,559
- Did I have four? - You did.

2068
01:09:18,559 --> 01:09:20,064
- Is he minus now? - He is.

2069
01:09:20,689 --> 01:09:22,529
Let's go eat.

2070
01:09:22,529 --> 01:09:24,160
- Okay! - Okay!

2071
01:09:24,160 --> 01:09:25,199
I knew it.

2072
01:09:25,199 --> 01:09:27,630
- This looks good. - This is awesome.

2073
01:09:27,630 --> 01:09:29,344
There are crab and soybean.

2074
01:09:29,370 --> 01:09:30,970
This is all crab.

2075
01:09:30,970 --> 01:09:33,040
(Crab and clam bibimbap are great with rice.)

2076
01:09:33,040 --> 01:09:34,309
That looks good.

2077
01:09:34,309 --> 01:09:35,915
This is driving me nuts.

2078
01:09:36,069 --> 01:09:37,814
That looks so good. This is driving me nuts.

2079
01:09:39,840 --> 01:09:41,854
- This is good. - Seaweed soup is really good.

2080
01:09:42,449 --> 01:09:44,455
- This is awesome. - Try one.

2081
01:09:44,479 --> 01:09:45,720
I feel sorry for those who can't eat.

2082
01:09:45,720 --> 01:09:47,594
This is a delicacy.

2083
01:09:47,620 --> 01:09:49,695
I like all everything that's served.

2084
01:09:49,920 --> 01:09:51,389
Seaweed soup is really good.

2085
01:09:51,389 --> 01:09:52,634
Kwang Soo.

2086
01:09:52,889 --> 01:09:54,564
(Ta-da)

2087
01:09:54,760 --> 01:09:57,005
(How's my card-flipping skill?)

2088
01:09:57,229 --> 01:09:59,304
- "One Eyed Jack". - "One Eyed Jack".

2089
01:09:59,960 --> 01:10:01,945
(He's happy they're promoting his movie.)

2090
01:10:02,069 --> 01:10:03,804
What are you doing on September 11?

2091
01:10:03,840 --> 01:10:05,014
Why?

2092
01:10:05,239 --> 01:10:06,340
"One Eyed Jack".

2093
01:10:06,340 --> 01:10:07,470
(Let's all go watch it.)

2094
01:10:07,470 --> 01:10:09,115
(Sliding)

2095
01:10:09,639 --> 01:10:11,354
You're unbelievable.

2096
01:10:12,410 --> 01:10:13,849
- I want to give him some. - Shouldn't we give him some?

2097
01:10:13,849 --> 01:10:14,955
(Should we give him too?)

2098
01:10:15,910 --> 01:10:17,080
What are you doing on September 11?

2099
01:10:17,080 --> 01:10:18,354
Me? Watching "One Eyed Jack".

2100
01:10:19,019 --> 01:10:21,495
(He pays the promotion fee.)

2101
01:10:21,550 --> 01:10:22,720
Is it out already?

2102
01:10:22,720 --> 01:10:23,934
(Thank you but it's so random.)

2103
01:10:24,660 --> 01:10:26,365
Does it taste like "One Eyed Jack"?

2104
01:10:27,760 --> 01:10:29,290
Gosh, "One Eyed Jack".

2105
01:10:29,290 --> 01:10:31,005
(Gosh, "One Eyed Jack".)

2106
01:10:31,500 --> 01:10:34,005
(He's buying time so that Se Chan can keep doing it.)

2107
01:10:35,269 --> 01:10:36,729
The seafood soup tastes like...

2108
01:10:36,729 --> 01:10:38,214
- "One Eyed Jack". - "One Eyed Jack".

2109
01:10:38,699 --> 01:10:40,199
The seafood soup is so good.

2110
01:10:40,199 --> 01:10:41,985
(They promote the movie and finish eating.)

2111
01:10:42,809 --> 01:10:44,554
We're here.

2112
01:10:44,580 --> 01:10:45,785
What's this?

2113
01:10:46,439 --> 01:10:48,109
- What's this now? - What's this?

2114
01:10:48,109 --> 01:10:49,180
What's this?

2115
01:10:49,180 --> 01:10:50,354
We're going to get wet.

2116
01:10:51,220 --> 01:10:52,819
This is it.

2117
01:10:52,819 --> 01:10:54,550
We have to reach the other end without falling in.

2118
01:10:54,550 --> 01:10:57,189
- Is this a quiz? - Yes, it is.

2119
01:10:57,189 --> 01:10:58,359
It's a quiz.

2120
01:10:58,359 --> 01:11:01,859
The last mission will be conducted in three teams.

2121
01:11:01,859 --> 01:11:03,260
It's Poker Face Quiz.

2122
01:11:03,260 --> 01:11:04,500
(Last Mission: Poker Face Quiz)

2123
01:11:04,500 --> 01:11:05,660
Is this the last one?

2124
01:11:05,660 --> 01:11:07,769
Choose one person to represent each team.

2125
01:11:07,769 --> 01:11:10,199
One person from each team will do somersaults,

2126
01:11:10,199 --> 01:11:12,739
and whoever reaches the buzzer first...

2127
01:11:12,739 --> 01:11:14,670
will get to answer the question.

2128
01:11:14,670 --> 01:11:16,710
If they cannot reach the buzzer in five seconds,

2129
01:11:16,710 --> 01:11:19,380
the entire team will get one coin deducted each per second.

2130
01:11:19,380 --> 01:11:22,449
(The entire team will get 1 coin deducted per second.)

2131
01:11:22,449 --> 01:11:23,585
We're in trouble.

2132
01:11:23,609 --> 01:11:25,849
The rest of the team can fill out the answers...

2133
01:11:25,849 --> 01:11:27,349
according to the questions.

2134
01:11:27,349 --> 01:11:29,290
The person representing each team...

2135
01:11:29,290 --> 01:11:31,489
can pick one person from a different team...

2136
01:11:31,489 --> 01:11:34,729
and guess whether their answer is right or wrong.

2137
01:11:34,729 --> 01:11:37,599
If the person is correct, they will get two R Coins...

2138
01:11:37,599 --> 01:11:40,359
and get to pick another person.

2139
01:11:40,359 --> 01:11:43,729
(Team Red, Blue, and White)

2140
01:11:43,729 --> 01:11:46,699
- Let's go. - If you are over five seconds,

2141
01:11:46,699 --> 01:11:48,644
you get one coin deducted for every second.

2142
01:11:48,840 --> 01:11:51,285
So Min, roll fast.

2143
01:11:51,340 --> 01:11:52,639
So Min, roll fast.

2144
01:11:52,639 --> 01:11:53,739
Let's go.

2145
01:11:53,739 --> 01:11:55,609
(The entire team gets 1 coin deducted for every second over.)

2146
01:11:55,609 --> 01:11:56,750
Ready...

2147
01:11:56,750 --> 01:11:57,880
(They get to answer questions in the order they press the buzzer.)

2148
01:11:57,880 --> 01:11:59,224
Set...

2149
01:11:59,479 --> 01:12:01,964
(The game starts.)

2150
01:12:02,550 --> 01:12:04,090
(They are on standby and start doing somersaults.)

2151
01:12:04,090 --> 01:12:05,090
So Min...

2152
01:12:05,090 --> 01:12:06,535
Good job. Hurry, Jung Min.

2153
01:12:07,059 --> 01:12:08,934
(Splashing)

2154
01:12:10,229 --> 01:12:11,260
(Jung Min can do somersaults.)

2155
01:12:11,260 --> 01:12:12,634
Good job.

2156
01:12:12,660 --> 01:12:14,430
(Next is Haha.)

2157
01:12:14,430 --> 01:12:15,599
Oh, gosh.

2158
01:12:15,599 --> 01:12:17,745
(Splashing)

2159
01:12:19,199 --> 01:12:20,945
(Canon ball)

2160
01:12:21,870 --> 01:12:24,680
(She rolls sideways and falls butt first in the water.)

2161
01:12:24,680 --> 01:12:28,424
(This is her specialty.)

2162
01:12:28,510 --> 01:12:30,010
(At that moment,)

2163
01:12:30,010 --> 01:12:31,649
(Jung Min charges ahead.)

2164
01:12:31,649 --> 01:12:33,695
Good job. Hurry, Jung Min.

2165
01:12:34,449 --> 01:12:35,689
(He reaches the buzzer first.)

2166
01:12:35,689 --> 01:12:37,050
Press it. There's no time.

2167
01:12:37,050 --> 01:12:39,260
(He touches the buzzer.)

2168
01:12:39,260 --> 01:12:41,989
(He gets to pick first.)

2169
01:12:41,989 --> 01:12:44,130
So Min, go. Hurry up.

2170
01:12:44,130 --> 01:12:45,604
Hurry up.

2171
01:12:46,359 --> 01:12:48,674
(She falls in the water again.)

2172
01:12:50,269 --> 01:12:51,300
(She was lined up correctly,)

2173
01:12:51,300 --> 01:12:53,340
(but goes off course.)

2174
01:12:53,340 --> 01:12:54,639
(She can't go straight when she does somersaults.)

2175
01:12:54,639 --> 01:12:56,439
She has no sense of balance.

2176
01:12:56,439 --> 01:12:57,655
I think she's so funny.

2177
01:12:58,880 --> 01:13:00,649
(Meanwhile,)

2178
01:13:00,649 --> 01:13:02,309
(Haha touches the buzzer.)

2179
01:13:02,309 --> 01:13:03,609
(This is a battle with herself.)

2180
01:13:03,609 --> 01:13:05,380
She has no sense of balance.

2181
01:13:05,380 --> 01:13:06,649
I think she's so funny.

2182
01:13:06,649 --> 01:13:07,689
(She falls in the water the 3rd time.)

2183
01:13:07,689 --> 01:13:09,420
- Are you all right? - I think she's so funny.

2184
01:13:09,420 --> 01:13:13,295
(She repeatedly rolls sideways.)

2185
01:13:14,489 --> 01:13:16,790
(1 splash)

2186
01:13:16,790 --> 01:13:19,130
(2 splashes)

2187
01:13:19,130 --> 01:13:20,945
(3 splashes)

2188
01:13:21,000 --> 01:13:22,144
Are you okay?

2189
01:13:22,300 --> 01:13:23,300
So Min.

2190
01:13:23,300 --> 01:13:24,540
(She consistently rolls sideways.)

2191
01:13:24,540 --> 01:13:25,814
So Min, you're awesome.

2192
01:13:27,340 --> 01:13:28,745
She fell all three times.

2193
01:13:29,510 --> 01:13:30,710
So Min, you're awesome.

2194
01:13:30,710 --> 01:13:31,910
(Haha: 5 seconds over, So Min: 15 seconds over.)

2195
01:13:31,910 --> 01:13:33,979
So Min, you have to guess right.

2196
01:13:33,979 --> 01:13:35,149
I'll guess right.

2197
01:13:35,149 --> 01:13:37,109
I only fell here, not there.

2198
01:13:37,109 --> 01:13:38,319
Here's the question.

2199
01:13:38,319 --> 01:13:41,090
In this novel,

2200
01:13:41,090 --> 01:13:43,920
this person's step-mother is Ppaengdeok.

2201
01:13:43,920 --> 01:13:46,094
Who is this person?

2202
01:13:46,559 --> 01:13:49,389
I learn so much on variety shows.

2203
01:13:49,389 --> 01:13:51,535
I'm serious. I used to be the worst.

2204
01:13:51,899 --> 01:13:53,705
I'm slightly confused.

2205
01:13:54,300 --> 01:13:56,304
I'm sure everybody knows. Kids know too.

2206
01:13:56,630 --> 01:13:58,370
(Peeking)

2207
01:13:58,370 --> 01:14:00,639
(He covers his answer.)

2208
01:14:00,639 --> 01:14:02,109
Here's the answer.

2209
01:14:02,109 --> 01:14:04,554
Ppaengdeok's step-daughter is...

2210
01:14:05,739 --> 01:14:07,340
- Shim Cheong. - Right.

2211
01:14:07,340 --> 01:14:08,979
I knew. I knew too.

2212
01:14:08,979 --> 01:14:11,779
- Everybody knew. - Please pick one person, Jung Min.

2213
01:14:11,779 --> 01:14:13,220
(Jung Min gets to pick one person.)

2214
01:14:13,220 --> 01:14:14,720
(He has to guess whether they got the question right or wrong.)

2215
01:14:14,720 --> 01:14:16,464
This is tricky.

2216
01:14:17,189 --> 01:14:18,859
Ji Hyo, did you know?

2217
01:14:18,859 --> 01:14:20,634
She asked me.

2218
01:14:20,689 --> 01:14:23,205
She asked if it's the story where they slap with a rice scoop.

2219
01:14:23,859 --> 01:14:25,000
"Heungbu and Nolbu"?

2220
01:14:25,000 --> 01:14:26,099
Seok Jin, isn't it that?

2221
01:14:26,099 --> 01:14:27,500
Where they get rice...

2222
01:14:27,500 --> 01:14:29,205
They hit his face...

2223
01:14:30,029 --> 01:14:31,699
(It's still bad to mistreat Heungbu or Shim Cheong.)

2224
01:14:31,699 --> 01:14:34,014
So I told her she was incorrect.

2225
01:14:34,510 --> 01:14:35,939
Yes, I'm confident.

2226
01:14:35,939 --> 01:14:37,580
(I'm confident unlike Ji Hyo.)

2227
01:14:37,580 --> 01:14:38,779
Seok Jin is...

2228
01:14:38,779 --> 01:14:39,910
(Seok Jin is...)

2229
01:14:39,910 --> 01:14:41,024
incorrect.

2230
01:14:41,279 --> 01:14:42,354
Me?

2231
01:14:42,510 --> 01:14:44,649
- He might be incorrect. - Incorrect for this?

2232
01:14:44,649 --> 01:14:46,279
- It's possible. - Who doesn't know this?

2233
01:14:46,279 --> 01:14:50,019
(If Seok Jin is incorrect, Team White wins 2 coins each.)

2234
01:14:50,019 --> 01:14:52,720
(What is his answer?)

2235
01:14:52,720 --> 01:14:53,819
(Shim Cheong)

2236
01:14:53,819 --> 01:14:56,330
(He's correct.)

2237
01:14:56,330 --> 01:14:58,430
(Jung Min's turn concludes, and he wins no coins.)

2238
01:14:58,430 --> 01:15:00,199
I hesitated whether to change it or not.

2239
01:15:00,199 --> 01:15:01,399
I almost wrote "Shim Shim".

2240
01:15:01,399 --> 01:15:04,029
What did Ji Yeon write?

2241
01:15:04,029 --> 01:15:05,639
I was certain about the answer.

2242
01:15:05,639 --> 01:15:06,670
She doesn't know.

2243
01:15:06,670 --> 01:15:09,739
(He's lying.)

2244
01:15:09,739 --> 01:15:11,580
- She doesn't know. - Really? How is she?

2245
01:15:11,580 --> 01:15:12,755
I'm really curious.

2246
01:15:13,010 --> 01:15:14,625
She's a little bit more...

2247
01:15:15,050 --> 01:15:16,580
- than Ji Hyo. - Really?

2248
01:15:16,580 --> 01:15:17,720
I'm serious.

2249
01:15:17,720 --> 01:15:19,149
(She's very pure.)

2250
01:15:19,149 --> 01:15:20,750
(Ji Yeon wins.)

2251
01:15:20,750 --> 01:15:22,090
It's hard to believe, right?

2252
01:15:22,090 --> 01:15:23,920
- I'm serious. - Don't say that.

2253
01:15:23,920 --> 01:15:25,735
Ask Jung Min. I'm serious.

2254
01:15:26,019 --> 01:15:28,260
There's more that she doesn't know than she does.

2255
01:15:28,260 --> 01:15:29,760
(There's a witness.)

2256
01:15:29,760 --> 01:15:31,399
(He understands how Ji Yeon is now.)

2257
01:15:31,399 --> 01:15:33,729
Ji Yeon, you're correct.

2258
01:15:33,729 --> 01:15:35,300
You're correct, right?

2259
01:15:35,300 --> 01:15:37,439
(Was she right or wrong?)

2260
01:15:37,439 --> 01:15:39,500
(She's incorrect with "Kongjwi".)

2261
01:15:39,500 --> 01:15:40,739
- Kongjwi. - Incorrect.

2262
01:15:40,739 --> 01:15:41,840
(Haha's turn concludes, and he wins no coins.)

2263
01:15:41,840 --> 01:15:43,214
She didn't know.

2264
01:15:43,309 --> 01:15:45,479
Ji Yeon meant it.

2265
01:15:45,479 --> 01:15:46,554
She was serious.

2266
01:15:46,739 --> 01:15:48,380
(Thanks to Ji Yeon's purity, it's So Min's turn to pick.)

2267
01:15:48,380 --> 01:15:51,479
Kwang Soo, you knew, right?

2268
01:15:51,479 --> 01:15:53,854
I didn't fool around.

2269
01:15:54,019 --> 01:15:55,050
Okay.

2270
01:15:55,050 --> 01:15:56,495
Kwang Soo is incorrect.

2271
01:15:56,889 --> 01:15:58,434
- All right. - Okay.

2272
01:15:58,889 --> 01:16:00,059
In 1, 2, 3.

2273
01:16:00,059 --> 01:16:01,989
(Was Kwang Soo right or wrong?)

2274
01:16:01,989 --> 01:16:04,130
(Chun Hyang)

2275
01:16:04,130 --> 01:16:05,460
I knew it.

2276
01:16:05,460 --> 01:16:07,674
I'll tell you a funny story.

2277
01:16:07,830 --> 01:16:10,745
Kwang Soo whispered this to me just now...

2278
01:16:10,870 --> 01:16:11,945
quietly.

2279
01:16:12,500 --> 01:16:15,139
"Shim Cheong and Chun Hyang are different people, right?"

2280
01:16:15,139 --> 01:16:16,540
(That was a shocking question.)

2281
01:16:16,540 --> 01:16:17,639
I got confused.

2282
01:16:17,639 --> 01:16:18,880
You're incredible.

2283
01:16:18,880 --> 01:16:20,010
(When the answer was revealed)

2284
01:16:20,010 --> 01:16:21,550
- Are they different people? - What?

2285
01:16:21,550 --> 01:16:22,880
Are they different people?

2286
01:16:22,880 --> 01:16:24,080
- Yes. - They're not the same, right?

2287
01:16:24,080 --> 01:16:25,519
(Shim Cheong and Chun Hyang are not the same, right?)

2288
01:16:25,519 --> 01:16:27,790
(He's Korea's most purist celebrity.)

2289
01:16:27,790 --> 01:16:30,920
- You shouldn't criticize Ji Yeon. - I just got confused.

2290
01:16:30,920 --> 01:16:33,819
Then was Jong Kook correct?

2291
01:16:33,819 --> 01:16:35,665
- He's incorrect. - I think he's incorrect.

2292
01:16:35,930 --> 01:16:37,960
- Then Jong Kook is incorrect. - Incorrect.

2293
01:16:37,960 --> 01:16:39,059
(She thinks Jong Kook is incorrect.)

2294
01:16:39,059 --> 01:16:40,205
I wrote "Chun Sik".

2295
01:16:40,430 --> 01:16:41,870
- Was he incorrect? - All right.

2296
01:16:41,870 --> 01:16:42,870
(Team Blue earns 2 coins.)

2297
01:16:42,870 --> 01:16:44,939
Ji Hyo knows this much. Ji Hyo is correct!

2298
01:16:44,939 --> 01:16:46,639
(She thinks Ji Hyo is correct.)

2299
01:16:46,639 --> 01:16:48,769
(Ji Hyo is correct.)

2300
01:16:48,769 --> 01:16:50,139
Yu Hwa is incorrect.

2301
01:16:50,139 --> 01:16:51,710
(She thinks Yu Hwa is incorrect.)

2302
01:16:51,710 --> 01:16:54,054
(Yu Hwa is correct.)

2303
01:16:54,210 --> 01:16:55,384
See?

2304
01:16:55,510 --> 01:16:56,880
I still guessed a lot.

2305
01:16:56,880 --> 01:16:58,479
- Good job. - Good job.

2306
01:16:58,479 --> 01:16:59,479
- Good job. - Good job.

2307
01:16:59,479 --> 01:17:01,550
(Current Number of R Coins)

2308
01:17:01,550 --> 01:17:03,420
(5th to 10th places will get punished.)

2309
01:17:03,420 --> 01:17:06,519
Let's conduct Full House one-by-one.

2310
01:17:06,519 --> 01:17:08,930
If there are only blue and red coins and no black,

2311
01:17:08,930 --> 01:17:11,559
the majority wins five coins.

2312
01:17:11,559 --> 01:17:14,274
If everybody picks black, you all win 10 coins each.

2313
01:17:15,199 --> 01:17:18,000
If there are more than two blacks with some blue and red,

2314
01:17:18,000 --> 01:17:20,639
black gets minus 5, and the rest gets plus 5.

2315
01:17:20,639 --> 01:17:22,370
If there's one black,

2316
01:17:22,370 --> 01:17:24,410
only that person...

2317
01:17:24,410 --> 01:17:25,955
wins 20 coins.

2318
01:17:26,239 --> 01:17:29,424
Please go up one-by-one, and make your last decision.

2319
01:17:29,649 --> 01:17:32,894
(Kwang Soo picks first.)

2320
01:17:32,949 --> 01:17:35,165
I'm going to do blue or black.

2321
01:17:35,389 --> 01:17:37,094
This is driving me nuts.

2322
01:17:37,660 --> 01:17:39,389
(He had 34 at maximum, but he's at minus 3 now.)

2323
01:17:39,389 --> 01:17:42,064
There can't be just one black.

2324
01:17:42,090 --> 01:17:43,529
This is driving me nuts.

2325
01:17:43,529 --> 01:17:45,660
(This is his last chance to change his destiny.)

2326
01:17:45,660 --> 01:17:49,405
(What did he pick?)

2327
01:17:50,630 --> 01:17:52,939
All the games today were...

2328
01:17:52,939 --> 01:17:54,714
mental games.

2329
01:17:55,739 --> 01:17:57,239
(It's Seok Jin's turn to pick.)

2330
01:17:57,239 --> 01:17:58,854
This is driving me nuts.

2331
01:17:59,010 --> 01:18:01,155
I have to decide.

2332
01:18:01,779 --> 01:18:03,410
(He picks one.)

2333
01:18:03,410 --> 01:18:05,724
I have to do this. I have to decide.

2334
01:18:06,279 --> 01:18:09,050
(What did he decide to do?)

2335
01:18:09,050 --> 01:18:10,519
Will I get some green juice?

2336
01:18:10,519 --> 01:18:12,090
(They continue to take turns.)

2337
01:18:12,090 --> 01:18:13,559
(Everybody is done.)

2338
01:18:13,559 --> 01:18:15,559
The last Full House is over.

2339
01:18:15,559 --> 01:18:17,905
When I count down,

2340
01:18:17,930 --> 01:18:19,760
please raise your coin...

2341
01:18:19,760 --> 01:18:22,144
over your head.

2342
01:18:22,300 --> 01:18:23,575
Let's do this.

2343
01:18:24,130 --> 01:18:25,170
One,

2344
01:18:25,170 --> 01:18:26,399
(This vote will determine their destinies.)

2345
01:18:26,399 --> 01:18:27,470
two,

2346
01:18:27,470 --> 01:18:30,410
(What is the last Full House result?)

2347
01:18:30,410 --> 01:18:31,485
three!

2348
01:18:32,010 --> 01:18:33,710
(Yu Hwa picks blue, and Ji Hyo picks red.)

2349
01:18:33,710 --> 01:18:34,710
Please.

2350
01:18:34,710 --> 01:18:36,149
(Jae Seok picks blue.)

2351
01:18:36,149 --> 01:18:38,319
(There are red and blue intermixed in close proportions.)

2352
01:18:38,319 --> 01:18:40,149
Is there a black coin?

2353
01:18:40,149 --> 01:18:41,295
Three!

2354
01:18:41,849 --> 01:18:43,995
(Seok Jin picks black.)

2355
01:18:44,149 --> 01:18:45,220
There's a black coin.

2356
01:18:45,220 --> 01:18:46,859
(If he's the only one, he gets 20 coins and wins the prize.)

2357
01:18:46,859 --> 01:18:48,205
There's black everywhere.

2358
01:18:48,260 --> 01:18:49,630
There's black everywhere.

2359
01:18:49,630 --> 01:18:51,729
There's black everywhere.

2360
01:18:51,729 --> 01:18:53,634
Why did you two pick black?

2361
01:18:54,330 --> 01:18:56,569
(Jung Min was safe from penalties, but he still picked black.)

2362
01:18:56,569 --> 01:18:59,199
Four of you will get five coins deducted.

2363
01:18:59,199 --> 01:19:00,739
Rest of you will get...

2364
01:19:00,739 --> 01:19:02,545
- plus five coins. - Yes!

2365
01:19:03,069 --> 01:19:06,014
- Why did you do that, Jung Min? - I'll take the portable fan.

2366
01:19:06,040 --> 01:19:08,750
He wasn't supposed to get penalties, but he does now.

2367
01:19:08,750 --> 01:19:10,255
Why did you do that, Jung Min?

2368
01:19:10,979 --> 01:19:13,920
We'll bring the prizes first.

2369
01:19:13,920 --> 01:19:16,420
Noni is really good for gout.

2370
01:19:16,420 --> 01:19:18,590
- This. - It's popular these days.

2371
01:19:18,590 --> 01:19:20,394
I'm envious.

2372
01:19:21,130 --> 01:19:23,130
Thank you. I didn't expect anything.

2373
01:19:23,130 --> 01:19:24,699
- Congratulations. - Jong Kook...

2374
01:19:24,699 --> 01:19:26,800
- cares about his health a lot. - I like this.

2375
01:19:26,800 --> 01:19:27,930
- I wish you good health. - This is good.

2376
01:19:27,930 --> 01:19:31,075
Jae Seok, Yu Hwa, and Se Chan, please take the fans.

2377
01:19:31,300 --> 01:19:32,670
Does Jae Seok get a fan too?

2378
01:19:32,670 --> 01:19:35,639
(He thought Jae Seok had bad luck.)

2379
01:19:35,639 --> 01:19:37,714
There are penalties left now.

2380
01:19:37,840 --> 01:19:39,085
However,

2381
01:19:39,180 --> 01:19:41,809
we didn't know so many people would be getting the penalties.

2382
01:19:41,809 --> 01:19:42,955
There's only one whipped cream,

2383
01:19:43,149 --> 01:19:45,279
- and 2 water bombs. - There are 2.

2384
01:19:45,279 --> 01:19:47,250
We'll save two people...

2385
01:19:47,250 --> 01:19:48,964
from 5th to 7th places,

2386
01:19:49,050 --> 01:19:51,835
and save 1 person from 8th to 10th places.

2387
01:19:52,590 --> 01:19:53,960
The rules are simple.

2388
01:19:53,960 --> 01:19:55,489
I'm getting my hopes up again.

2389
01:19:55,489 --> 01:19:58,729
There are blue, red, and black coins in the bags.

2390
01:19:58,729 --> 01:19:59,899
Rock-paper-scissors

2391
01:19:59,899 --> 01:20:02,970
(The person who chooses a black coin gets the whipped cream penalty.)

2392
01:20:02,970 --> 01:20:05,699
Out of this group, the person who gets black...

2393
01:20:05,699 --> 01:20:07,139
will get the penalty.

2394
01:20:07,139 --> 01:20:09,939
I started at Korean beef set. That's where I started.

2395
01:20:09,939 --> 01:20:11,014
I'm different from them.

2396
01:20:11,279 --> 01:20:13,380
In three, raise it above your head.

2397
01:20:13,380 --> 01:20:14,510
Let's go.

2398
01:20:14,510 --> 01:20:15,655
One,

2399
01:20:16,010 --> 01:20:17,155
two,

2400
01:20:17,779 --> 01:20:18,819
three.

2401
01:20:18,819 --> 01:20:20,250
(The person who pulls out black gets the whipped cream penalty.)

2402
01:20:20,250 --> 01:20:21,319
What?

2403
01:20:21,319 --> 01:20:23,889
(Who will it be that 1 person?)

2404
01:20:23,889 --> 01:20:25,989
(Jung Min is exempt.)

2405
01:20:25,989 --> 01:20:28,330
(Who will it be from these two?)

2406
01:20:28,330 --> 01:20:29,460
Who is it?

2407
01:20:29,460 --> 01:20:30,630
It's Kwang Soo.

2408
01:20:30,630 --> 01:20:34,104
(Kwang Soo gets the penalty.)

2409
01:20:34,130 --> 01:20:36,069
(It was going to be him anyway.)

2410
01:20:36,069 --> 01:20:37,199
I'm not even shocked.

2411
01:20:37,199 --> 01:20:39,269
- Kwang Soo. - It was going to be him.

2412
01:20:39,269 --> 01:20:41,769
He almost had Korean beef set.

2413
01:20:41,769 --> 01:20:42,870
This is not fun.

2414
01:20:42,870 --> 01:20:44,010
It's us now.

2415
01:20:44,010 --> 01:20:45,010
(It's time to decide the water bomb penalties.)

2416
01:20:45,010 --> 01:20:46,210
This.

2417
01:20:46,210 --> 01:20:47,955
No, this one.

2418
01:20:48,349 --> 01:20:49,949
I don't know. There's only one spot.

2419
01:20:49,949 --> 01:20:52,849
Only one person survives. The person who gets black survives.

2420
01:20:52,849 --> 01:20:54,080
- Only one person survives. - One,

2421
01:20:54,080 --> 01:20:55,224
two,

2422
01:20:55,389 --> 01:20:56,389
three.

2423
01:20:56,389 --> 01:20:58,689
(What is the result?)

2424
01:20:58,689 --> 01:21:00,720
(Seok Jin gets black.)

2425
01:21:00,720 --> 01:21:02,930
(He's exempt.)

2426
01:21:02,930 --> 01:21:05,000
(I won't get soaked today!)

2427
01:21:05,000 --> 01:21:06,205
It's raining.

2428
01:21:06,300 --> 01:21:08,430
- Let's hurry. - We have to hurry.

2429
01:21:08,430 --> 01:21:10,144
Congratulations, Seok Jin.

2430
01:21:10,830 --> 01:21:13,699
(He won't be completely dry because of the rain.)

2431
01:21:13,699 --> 01:21:15,340
We'll start at the same time.

2432
01:21:15,340 --> 01:21:17,040
We'll do the whipped cream and water bomb at once.

2433
01:21:17,040 --> 01:21:18,939
- Let's go. Good luck! - Let's go. Good luck!

2434
01:21:18,939 --> 01:21:19,979
Here we go.

2435
01:21:19,979 --> 01:21:23,054
1, 2, 3.

2436
01:21:23,210 --> 01:21:25,550
(The penalties are launched.)

2437
01:21:25,550 --> 01:21:27,224
Goodness.

2438
01:21:27,420 --> 01:21:29,050
(Exploding)

2439
01:21:29,050 --> 01:21:31,695
(You never get used to this face.)

2440
01:21:32,319 --> 01:21:33,519
Yes!

2441
01:21:33,519 --> 01:21:34,590
(This washes away the heat.)

2442
01:21:34,590 --> 01:21:36,665
So Min got pushed forward.

2443
01:21:37,899 --> 01:21:39,804
She got short.

2444
01:21:40,830 --> 01:21:42,130
Good luck with "Tazza: One Eyed Jack".

2445
01:21:42,130 --> 01:21:43,370
Thank you.

2446
01:21:43,370 --> 01:21:45,399
- Good work. - Good work.

2447
01:21:45,399 --> 01:21:47,214
(Jung Min, Ji Yeon, and Yu Hwa, thank you for joining us.)

2448
01:21:47,470 --> 01:21:49,870
(They're glad to see Sunny...)

2449
01:21:49,870 --> 01:21:51,540
(and SUNMI.)

2450
01:21:51,540 --> 01:21:53,615
(Actress Kim Ye Won and Announcer Jang Ye Won)

2451
01:21:53,880 --> 01:21:56,050
(They display their charms during dance time.)

2452
01:21:56,050 --> 01:21:58,019
(The dance party gets heated.)

2453
01:21:58,019 --> 01:21:59,779
(So Min and Ji Hyo intrude.)

2454
01:21:59,779 --> 01:22:01,394
(This is part of initiation on Running Man.)

2455
01:22:01,420 --> 01:22:03,090
(And...)

2456
01:22:03,090 --> 01:22:06,464
(They suddenly get handed a mysterious book of prophecy.)

2457
01:22:06,889 --> 01:22:09,304
(Is there a dark force among them?)

2458
01:22:09,790 --> 01:22:12,505
(They start doubting each other in order to find the dark force.)

2459
01:22:13,130 --> 01:22:14,359
