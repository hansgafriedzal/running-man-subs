1
00:00:05,670 --> 00:00:10,378
(Running Man has been airing for 9 years without a break.)

2
00:00:10,379 --> 00:00:14,209
(So many of the fans have supported the members of Running Man.)

3
00:00:14,210 --> 00:00:16,579
(We have prepared this special episode to repay their support.)

4
00:00:16,580 --> 00:00:18,965
(The very first fan-meet in Korea, Running Man's Fan-Meet)

5
00:00:19,390 --> 00:00:20,749
(Opening song by all 8 members)

6
00:00:20,750 --> 00:00:25,864
(The first performance was a grand opening of the fan-meet.)

7
00:00:28,329 --> 00:00:33,844
(The opening song by the members was about gratitude for the fans.)

8
00:00:35,170 --> 00:00:37,245
(And there are more performances to come.)

9
00:00:37,899 --> 00:00:39,468
(It's time to show off their charms.)

10
00:00:39,469 --> 00:00:42,455
(The members of Running Man will perform separately.)

11
00:00:43,539 --> 00:00:47,008
(Apink, Nucksal and Code Kunst, SORAN, and Gummy)

12
00:00:47,009 --> 00:00:50,319
(Joint performances with the best lineup of musicians)

13
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:51,349
(Group choreography)

14
00:00:51,350 --> 00:00:54,048
(And the highlight of the fan-meet, the group choreography)

15
00:00:54,049 --> 00:00:56,559
(Group choreography)

16
00:00:56,560 --> 00:00:57,718
(Theme song, "I Like You")

17
00:00:57,719 --> 00:01:00,428
(The show's first theme song will make the grand finale!)

18
00:01:00,429 --> 00:01:03,974
(The fan-meet of Running Man starts now.)

19
00:01:06,569 --> 00:01:09,968
(They went on a long journey of 100 days in preparing it.)

20
00:01:09,969 --> 00:01:13,244
(The fan-meet begins at last.)

21
00:01:13,570 --> 00:01:15,479
(Utterly nervous)

22
00:01:15,480 --> 00:01:16,908
(However...)

23
00:01:16,909 --> 00:01:19,078
- "a spy among you." - Come on!

24
00:01:19,079 --> 00:01:20,078
(There is a spy among you today.)

25
00:01:20,079 --> 00:01:23,119
(One of them is a spy?)

26
00:01:23,120 --> 00:01:26,748
(We asked the spy to be the most passionate today.)

27
00:01:26,749 --> 00:01:29,358
(The audience already knows who the spy is.)

28
00:01:29,359 --> 00:01:30,388
(There are hints?)

29
00:01:30,389 --> 00:01:31,718
you finish your performance,

30
00:01:31,719 --> 00:01:33,358
(When the members finish their performance,)

31
00:01:33,359 --> 00:01:36,805
(if the shout from the audience is over 120dB, they get a hint.)

32
00:01:38,059 --> 00:01:40,275
(Why are you doing this?)

33
00:01:40,329 --> 00:01:41,399
With your expectations...

34
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:45,044
(After learning about the mission, they finish the opening segment.)

35
00:01:45,370 --> 00:01:46,408
(The race...)

36
00:01:46,409 --> 00:01:49,184
(starts!)

37
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:51,039
(It's time for the members' individual performances.)

38
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:52,908
You're so handsome, Se Chan!

39
00:01:52,909 --> 00:01:56,124
(Which member will start off the performance?)

40
00:01:59,549 --> 00:02:00,964
(Getting splashed)

41
00:02:02,719 --> 00:02:06,104
(Haha)

42
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:09,734
(The shortest villain who never hesitates)

43
00:02:10,730 --> 00:02:12,129
(He throws things,)

44
00:02:12,130 --> 00:02:13,199
(hits people,)

45
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:14,305
(and runs!)

46
00:02:15,070 --> 00:02:17,898
(He even disregards BTS as if they're nothing.)

47
00:02:17,899 --> 00:02:22,284
(What kind of performance will Haha show the fans?)

48
00:02:26,310 --> 00:02:28,994
(Exploding with anticipation)

49
00:02:29,250 --> 00:02:31,349
We have to give it our all today.

50
00:02:31,350 --> 00:02:33,295
Since this is going to air on TV, make sure you give it your all.

51
00:02:34,220 --> 00:02:36,434
Just like the old times. Give it your all.

52
00:02:37,089 --> 00:02:38,464
Let's give it our 100 percent.

53
00:02:39,190 --> 00:02:42,135
(Utterly nervous)

54
00:02:43,329 --> 00:02:45,105
Get them hyped up to the max.

55
00:02:45,669 --> 00:02:46,868
Don't let them rest for a second.

56
00:02:46,869 --> 00:02:49,744
(He can't conceal the nervousness although he's a veteran performer.)

57
00:02:52,109 --> 00:02:54,039
We can go out now.

58
00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:55,615
Go out now.

59
00:02:56,839 --> 00:02:58,979
(Haha will perform first.)

60
00:02:58,980 --> 00:03:01,224
(What kind of performance will he show the fans?)

61
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:08,094
("Dang Diggi Bang" by RGP: Haha, Skull, and M.Tyson)

62
00:03:08,989 --> 00:03:10,789
(Even their appearance...)

63
00:03:10,790 --> 00:03:13,504
(is enough to get them excited.)

64
00:03:14,230 --> 00:03:16,129
(Don't I look pretty cool?)

65
00:03:16,130 --> 00:03:17,404
- Get up! - Okay.

66
00:03:17,530 --> 00:03:18,904
It's "Dang Diggi Bang".

67
00:03:19,269 --> 00:03:20,368
"Dang Diggi Bang".

68
00:03:20,369 --> 00:03:21,775
(Dancing timidly)

69
00:03:23,470 --> 00:03:24,814
- Get up! - Okay.

70
00:03:32,250 --> 00:03:36,224
(The reggae master, Skull, starts off the song like a pro.)

71
00:03:38,619 --> 00:03:40,964
(It's Haha's turn now!)

72
00:03:41,089 --> 00:03:44,395
(Rapping furiously)

73
00:03:45,019 --> 00:03:47,129
(Haha's furious rapping makes the audience go wild!)

74
00:03:47,130 --> 00:03:49,474
(If it goes over 120dB, they will get a hint.)

75
00:03:55,230 --> 00:03:58,015
(Haha proves himself to be a singer.)

76
00:03:58,299 --> 00:04:00,108
(Raise them up above your heads)

77
00:04:00,109 --> 00:04:02,615
(I feel like V in BTS)

78
00:04:02,639 --> 00:04:04,784
- Put your hands up and clap! - Clap now!

79
00:04:05,549 --> 00:04:06,724
Raise them higher!

80
00:04:06,750 --> 00:04:08,355
- Keep going! - Let's go.

81
00:04:09,320 --> 00:04:12,765
(The heat of the performance reaches the green room.)

82
00:04:13,489 --> 00:04:15,295
(Feeling excited)

83
00:04:15,919 --> 00:04:17,689
(His nervous face is gone,)

84
00:04:17,690 --> 00:04:19,534
(and he makes the audience join like a pro.)

85
00:04:19,929 --> 00:04:21,604
(His secret weapon, his jump)

86
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:25,974
(Thanks to his wild jumps, it goes over 115dB.)

87
00:04:27,469 --> 00:04:30,299
(His confidence explodes along with the thundering shouts.)

88
00:04:30,300 --> 00:04:33,185
(His confidence explodes along with the thundering shouts.)

89
00:04:33,570 --> 00:04:38,515
(It's like a revival meeting for Haha.)

90
00:04:40,649 --> 00:04:43,224
Since this is what he used to, he seems relaxed.

91
00:04:44,550 --> 00:04:46,249
The beach woman

92
00:04:46,250 --> 00:04:47,419
(The green room is busy for the next performance.)

93
00:04:47,420 --> 00:04:48,864
With her

94
00:04:49,190 --> 00:04:52,065
(Utterly nervous)

95
00:04:52,760 --> 00:04:55,598
(Even though the audience is going wild with Haha,)

96
00:04:55,599 --> 00:04:59,044
(the other members keep on practicing.)

97
00:05:00,700 --> 00:05:01,828
Louder!

98
00:05:01,829 --> 00:05:04,044
(The next members are ever so nervous.)

99
00:05:05,370 --> 00:05:09,714
(Haha is more passionate than his usual self. Is he the spy?)

100
00:05:11,310 --> 00:05:12,509
(Say, "Oh, yes!")

101
00:05:12,510 --> 00:05:13,755
(Oh, yes!)

102
00:05:14,250 --> 00:05:15,354
(Yes!)

103
00:05:16,719 --> 00:05:19,348
One more time. Scream, everyone!

104
00:05:19,349 --> 00:05:22,395
(Haha and Skull's performance was wild to the end.)

105
00:05:22,459 --> 00:05:24,559
Scream, everyone!

106
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:26,828
(The audience went wild.)

107
00:05:26,829 --> 00:05:30,804
(Did it go over 120dB?)

108
00:05:31,260 --> 00:05:34,044
(Haha, you're the best!)

109
00:05:35,229 --> 00:05:37,669
(Haha's performance lingers even with these talented musicians.)

110
00:05:37,670 --> 00:05:40,445
(Haha's performance lingers even with these talented musicians.)

111
00:05:41,610 --> 00:05:43,614
(Haha, you're the best!)

112
00:05:44,909 --> 00:05:46,708
Stang, digi, digi, ding, dang, digi, bang, bang

113
00:05:46,709 --> 00:05:48,249
Digi, digi, dang, digi, dang, digi, bang

114
00:05:48,250 --> 00:05:49,478
Hello, we're a new group.

115
00:05:49,479 --> 00:05:51,718
- I'm Skull of RGP. - I'm Haha.

116
00:05:51,719 --> 00:05:54,018
- Yes! - Yes!

117
00:05:54,019 --> 00:05:55,525
Yes!

118
00:05:55,659 --> 00:05:59,189
All right. We'll bring in the next performer to the stage.

119
00:05:59,190 --> 00:06:00,228
(They are disappointed.)

120
00:06:00,229 --> 00:06:01,804
Running Man's...

121
00:06:04,099 --> 00:06:09,699
(The kind audience cares about the performer's feeling.)

122
00:06:09,700 --> 00:06:13,468
(He has never experienced such support from anywhere.)

123
00:06:13,469 --> 00:06:15,685
(He's enjoying it to the fullest thanks to the kind audience.)

124
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:17,809
(Thank you for the support. From The Gang)

125
00:06:17,810 --> 00:06:19,049
- You'll see me again. - But...

126
00:06:19,050 --> 00:06:21,609
- You'll see me again. - there are more great performances.

127
00:06:21,610 --> 00:06:23,825
These two worked really hard.

128
00:06:24,349 --> 00:06:25,594
My role model.

129
00:06:26,649 --> 00:06:29,234
(Haha's role model?)

130
00:06:29,889 --> 00:06:32,094
The big brother of Running Man, Seok Jin.

131
00:06:32,329 --> 00:06:34,364
Although she's about to turn 40, she's still adorable.

132
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:36,398
It's the joint performance by Ji Hyo and Seok Jin.

133
00:06:36,399 --> 00:06:38,528
- Go! - Yes!

134
00:06:38,529 --> 00:06:41,404
(Full of expectations)

135
00:06:42,500 --> 00:06:45,375
(Haha heads to the backstage after his performance.)

136
00:06:46,339 --> 00:06:48,015
- Well done. - Good job.

137
00:06:48,440 --> 00:06:49,955
- Haha. That way. - Well done.

138
00:06:52,110 --> 00:06:53,525
I have so much to do right now.

139
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:55,654
Hurry. I have to pick one?

140
00:06:56,250 --> 00:06:57,395
Is that the hint?

141
00:06:58,019 --> 00:07:00,689
Yes. The decibels of your audience was...

142
00:07:00,690 --> 00:07:02,224
(It must go over 120dB for him to get a hint.)

143
00:07:03,190 --> 00:07:04,588
Scream, everyone!

144
00:07:04,589 --> 00:07:08,458
(The audience went wild.)

145
00:07:08,459 --> 00:07:12,974
(How high did the decibels go up?)

146
00:07:13,570 --> 00:07:14,904
(Let's reach 120dB!)

147
00:07:15,269 --> 00:07:18,699
The audience's cheer for your performance reached 123dB.

148
00:07:18,700 --> 00:07:20,069
You successfully obtained a hint.

149
00:07:20,070 --> 00:07:21,708
There are 3 hints. Choose 1.

150
00:07:21,709 --> 00:07:22,815
(Haha gets a hint.)

151
00:07:23,339 --> 00:07:25,309
Who on earth is the spy?

152
00:07:25,310 --> 00:07:26,455
(Who on earth is the spy?)

153
00:07:26,979 --> 00:07:30,218
"The spy suits Friday, but doesn't suit Sunday."

154
00:07:30,219 --> 00:07:33,588
(The spy suits Friday, but doesn't suit Sunday.)

155
00:07:33,589 --> 00:07:35,018
"The spy suits Friday,"

156
00:07:35,019 --> 00:07:36,435
"but not Sunday"?

157
00:07:37,459 --> 00:07:39,158
(He still needs more information. Who is the spy?)

158
00:07:39,159 --> 00:07:40,559
Okay. I'll think about it.

159
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:42,265
(He still needs more information. Who is the spy?)

160
00:07:42,829 --> 00:07:45,259
(The audience is still hyped up after Haha's performance.)

161
00:07:45,260 --> 00:07:46,445
I'm slightly nervous, you know?

162
00:07:46,930 --> 00:07:48,069
Aren't you nervous?

163
00:07:48,070 --> 00:07:49,338
I'm a bit nervous.

164
00:07:49,339 --> 00:07:52,945
(Even the veteran entertainers can't conceal their nervousness.)

165
00:07:53,139 --> 00:07:55,214
Should I wear sunglasses?

166
00:07:55,810 --> 00:07:56,955
No?

167
00:07:58,440 --> 00:08:00,654
Don't get wet

168
00:08:00,909 --> 00:08:02,949
I'll go home nice and dry today

169
00:08:02,950 --> 00:08:06,424
(Jee Seok Jin)

170
00:08:07,289 --> 00:08:08,848
(As the oldest member of Running Man,)

171
00:08:08,849 --> 00:08:10,995
(he always gets splashed first to set a good example.)

172
00:08:11,260 --> 00:08:12,505
(Squeaking)

173
00:08:13,329 --> 00:08:15,489
(Seok Jin is indeed the first-tier entertainer.)

174
00:08:15,490 --> 00:08:17,904
(He doesn't spare his body to make people laugh.)

175
00:08:19,599 --> 00:08:21,044
- That's me. - My gosh. Bo Mi.

176
00:08:22,469 --> 00:08:24,815
- Start the race. - The race has started.

177
00:08:25,670 --> 00:08:28,945
(He's the official starter of the race.)

178
00:08:29,979 --> 00:08:32,784
(We'll look forward to it today.)

179
00:08:35,510 --> 00:08:36,755
Madam Gurie.

180
00:08:37,149 --> 00:08:40,324
(Song Ji Hyo)

181
00:08:41,219 --> 00:08:42,794
(Get lost.)

182
00:08:43,420 --> 00:08:45,034
(She looks pretty even when she curses.)

183
00:08:46,129 --> 00:08:50,105
(The strong lady everyone recognizes and legend of girl crush)

184
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:54,845
(Regardless of the location, she's always brave and daring.)

185
00:08:57,369 --> 00:08:58,539
It's higher than you thought?

186
00:08:58,540 --> 00:09:00,569
(She's an incredibly pretty all-around member.)

187
00:09:00,570 --> 00:09:02,654
(She's an incredibly pretty all-around member.)

188
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:05,355
(She's amazing.)

189
00:09:05,509 --> 00:09:07,184
She's amazing. Seriously.

190
00:09:08,150 --> 00:09:11,495
(Ace of Running Man, Song Ji Hyo!)

191
00:09:12,180 --> 00:09:13,748
Why did you choose this?

192
00:09:13,749 --> 00:09:15,649
- I mean... - It's so hard.

193
00:09:15,650 --> 00:09:17,019
(Seok Jin and Ji Hyo got together for the performance.)

194
00:09:17,020 --> 00:09:19,304
- You... - Hear me out, Seok Jin.

195
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:20,934
She chose it. She did.

196
00:09:20,959 --> 00:09:21,988
- My gosh. - She chose it.

197
00:09:21,989 --> 00:09:23,235
- She chose it. - Listen.

198
00:09:23,499 --> 00:09:26,299
Both of us have to sing the song alone.

199
00:09:26,300 --> 00:09:27,968
- Right. - But we have so much to do though.

200
00:09:27,969 --> 00:09:30,345
- So we can perform as a pair. - My gosh.

201
00:09:30,700 --> 00:09:32,769
I chose this song...

202
00:09:32,770 --> 00:09:35,639
because I wanted to get the audience excited.

203
00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:37,279
- You... - You just woke up, didn't you?

204
00:09:37,280 --> 00:09:38,508
- You said you were okay with it. - You just woke up, right?

205
00:09:38,509 --> 00:09:39,684
Yes.

206
00:09:40,609 --> 00:09:42,595
I only put on the sunscreen.

207
00:09:42,849 --> 00:09:44,618
You said you were okay with the song.

208
00:09:44,619 --> 00:09:46,848
But you have to do a really good job with the song.

209
00:09:46,849 --> 00:09:47,924
(What's the song they chose?)

210
00:09:48,619 --> 00:09:52,495
(Sexy song, "Don't Give It to Me" by Loco and Hwasa)

211
00:09:53,790 --> 00:09:55,934
(Chatting among themselves)

212
00:09:56,300 --> 00:09:58,005
(They will sing "Don't Give It to Me"?)

213
00:09:58,030 --> 00:09:59,828
This is such a hard song.

214
00:09:59,829 --> 00:10:01,044
Don't you agree, M.Tyson?

215
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:03,544
Isn't it really hard to sing like Hwasa?

216
00:10:03,739 --> 00:10:05,169
It's a very difficult song.

217
00:10:05,170 --> 00:10:06,715
It's very difficult.

218
00:10:06,839 --> 00:10:07,939
What are we going to do?

219
00:10:07,940 --> 00:10:10,508
Shouldn't she sound like she's in pain when she's singing it?

220
00:10:10,509 --> 00:10:11,539
- Yes. - In pain?

221
00:10:11,540 --> 00:10:12,549
Pretend you're sick.

222
00:10:12,550 --> 00:10:15,348
- You must get into the song. - You know?

223
00:10:15,349 --> 00:10:17,149
- You really must get into the song. - Exactly.

224
00:10:17,150 --> 00:10:18,919
(An advanced acting skill to convey the fling is needed.)

225
00:10:18,920 --> 00:10:21,625
I'm sorry

226
00:10:22,219 --> 00:10:24,019
(Sounding in pain)

227
00:10:24,020 --> 00:10:25,294
You must be in pain like this.

228
00:10:27,359 --> 00:10:30,128
(What is that? I guess he's really in pain.)

229
00:10:30,129 --> 00:10:33,228
- You're trying to cut me out - I don't want to hear it.

230
00:10:33,229 --> 00:10:35,429
- You have to sing it like this. - Why don't you switch the roles?

231
00:10:35,430 --> 00:10:37,569
- Why don't you switch the roles? - Do you want to switch the roles?

232
00:10:37,570 --> 00:10:39,468
- I'm Ko Sa. - Ko Sa.

233
00:10:39,469 --> 00:10:40,845
- "Ko Sa". - "Ko Sa"?

234
00:10:40,869 --> 00:10:42,914
- Sleeping Co. - Sleeping Co.

235
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:45,679
It's not bad. Ko Sa and Sleeping Co.

236
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:46,855
I(t's not bad. Ko Sa and Sleeping Co.)

237
00:10:47,479 --> 00:10:49,319
- It's nice. - Ko Sa and Sleeping Co.

238
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:50,824
(He loves his own joke.)

239
00:10:52,050 --> 00:10:53,549
(Ko Sa and Sleeping Co start recording the song!)

240
00:10:53,550 --> 00:10:55,064
(Ko Sa and Sleeping Co start recording the song!)

241
00:10:55,890 --> 00:10:58,534
(Ji Hyo's singing suddenly comes into their minds.)

242
00:10:59,829 --> 00:11:07,199
(The memory of loving you like crazy)

243
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:09,615
(Did someone ride a horse here?)

244
00:11:10,369 --> 00:11:13,215
(Song Ji Hyo is out.)

245
00:11:14,109 --> 00:11:17,454
(She's known to be an awful actor.)

246
00:11:18,180 --> 00:11:21,284
(Ji Hyo carefully gets into the rhythms.)

247
00:11:22,209 --> 00:11:23,578
It's dangerous

248
00:11:23,579 --> 00:11:27,025
I'm on the edge when I barely managed to stop myself

249
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:29,389
(Her sexy vibrato pulls off Hwasa's sexy intro part.)

250
00:11:29,390 --> 00:11:31,595
(Is this a new discovery of her talent?)

251
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:35,064
(Everyone is surprised.)

252
00:11:36,459 --> 00:11:37,758
She's better than I thought.

253
00:11:37,759 --> 00:11:38,834
(He's surprised.)

254
00:11:40,329 --> 00:11:43,139
(The weakling, Seok Jin's rap)

255
00:11:43,140 --> 00:11:46,809
(The ace member, Ji Hyo's singing)

256
00:11:46,810 --> 00:11:48,439
(Unexpectedly, they make a nice pair.)

257
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:50,154
(How will their performance pan out?)

258
00:11:51,140 --> 00:11:55,208
("Don't Give It to Me" by Seok Jin and Ji Hyo)

259
00:11:55,209 --> 00:11:57,078
(A bottle of wine and glasses are set up on the stage.)

260
00:11:57,079 --> 00:11:59,924
(A man and a woman are having a fling.)

261
00:12:00,349 --> 00:12:03,819
(Ji Hyo exudes a voluptuous beauty.)

262
00:12:03,820 --> 00:12:06,988
(And he's looking at Ji Hyo.)

263
00:12:06,989 --> 00:12:09,034
(Seok Jin, his first time having a fling)

264
00:12:09,359 --> 00:12:11,574
(He dressed up to the nines.)

265
00:12:12,969 --> 00:12:15,328
(It's dangerous.)

266
00:12:15,329 --> 00:12:17,745
(I'm on the edge when I barely managed to stop myself.)

267
00:12:18,040 --> 00:12:20,439
(The number hikes up thanks to Ji Hyo's sexy looks.)

268
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:23,154
(Ji Hyo is pretty today as always.)

269
00:12:23,410 --> 00:12:26,385
(Her first line captivates him.)

270
00:12:27,379 --> 00:12:31,049
(The tension and mood are elevated.)

271
00:12:31,050 --> 00:12:32,924
(Look at me.)

272
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:36,934
(She's close to bursting into laughter.)

273
00:12:39,530 --> 00:12:41,204
(What's wrong with him?)

274
00:12:42,359 --> 00:12:46,128
(She warns him.)

275
00:12:46,129 --> 00:12:49,975
(Don't step over the boundary.)

276
00:12:52,540 --> 00:12:53,838
(Don't give me.)

277
00:12:53,839 --> 00:12:56,708
(Don't give me alcohol.)

278
00:12:56,709 --> 00:13:00,355
(If I get drunk, I might make a move on you.)

279
00:13:00,450 --> 00:13:02,578
(He's mesmerized.)

280
00:13:02,579 --> 00:13:04,618
(He tries to stay calm.)

281
00:13:04,619 --> 00:13:06,519
She doesn't look awkward at all...

282
00:13:06,520 --> 00:13:07,848
when she's all dolled up.

283
00:13:07,849 --> 00:13:09,194
- Right. - It suits her.

284
00:13:09,219 --> 00:13:11,358
- She's acting. - Right.

285
00:13:11,359 --> 00:13:12,465
She's good.

286
00:13:13,859 --> 00:13:16,498
- Seok Jin... - Don't sway to the beat.

287
00:13:16,499 --> 00:13:17,834
He did this.

288
00:13:18,999 --> 00:13:21,944
(Squirming)

289
00:13:22,599 --> 00:13:23,769
He's the type...

290
00:13:23,770 --> 00:13:25,715
who'd go home alone at 4am.

291
00:13:27,670 --> 00:13:30,115
(He gets ready to sing.)

292
00:13:31,540 --> 00:13:34,225
(What is this?)

293
00:13:35,280 --> 00:13:39,424
(Surprisingly, he does well.)

294
00:13:43,219 --> 00:13:44,735
He's good.

295
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:50,098
(He continues to rap well.)

296
00:13:50,099 --> 00:13:54,975
(But he brings up too much emotion.)

297
00:13:57,099 --> 00:13:59,485
He's good at rapping, but his gestures are too old-school.

298
00:14:01,839 --> 00:14:05,615
(Despite his old-school gestures, they don't look bad together.)

299
00:14:06,209 --> 00:14:09,679
(They're getting in the mood.)

300
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:11,694
(What is this alcohol?)

301
00:14:14,989 --> 00:14:17,135
(What is that?)

302
00:14:18,489 --> 00:14:20,689
(They get in the mood.)

303
00:14:20,690 --> 00:14:23,235
(Cheers)

304
00:14:25,629 --> 00:14:28,628
(They make the crowd cheer.)

305
00:14:28,629 --> 00:14:32,245
(The decibels rise.)

306
00:14:42,109 --> 00:14:43,819
(It was a surprising harmony...)

307
00:14:43,820 --> 00:14:47,294
(between the 50-year-old Seok Jin and the horrible singer, Ji Hyo.)

308
00:14:47,950 --> 00:14:50,218
(2019 version of "Don't Give It to Me"...)

309
00:14:50,219 --> 00:14:52,458
(by the sexy Ji Hyo and the confident Seok Jin)

310
00:14:52,459 --> 00:14:53,804
Thank you!

311
00:14:56,430 --> 00:14:57,659
(The audience is elated by this unexpected duet.)

312
00:14:57,660 --> 00:14:58,699
Thank you!

313
00:14:58,700 --> 00:15:00,245
(The audience is elated by this unexpected duet.)

314
00:15:01,900 --> 00:15:05,345
(Great work!)

315
00:15:07,009 --> 00:15:08,108
They're good.

316
00:15:08,109 --> 00:15:09,314
That was amazing.

317
00:15:09,910 --> 00:15:11,314
You see...

318
00:15:11,979 --> 00:15:14,708
We prepared so much for this, but we were so anxious back there.

319
00:15:14,709 --> 00:15:16,225
I'm not sure if we did a good job.

320
00:15:16,879 --> 00:15:18,449
(You did well.)

321
00:15:18,450 --> 00:15:20,088
It was so nerve-racking.

322
00:15:20,089 --> 00:15:21,889
- It really was. - Yes.

323
00:15:21,890 --> 00:15:23,265
Isn't Ji Hyo so beautiful?

324
00:15:23,759 --> 00:15:25,595
- Yes! - Yes!

325
00:15:25,820 --> 00:15:27,564
Isn't he so good-looking?

326
00:15:27,759 --> 00:15:29,059
- Yes! - Yes!

327
00:15:29,060 --> 00:15:30,605
Doesn't he look like Loco?

328
00:15:30,759 --> 00:15:31,899
(They hesitate.)

329
00:15:31,900 --> 00:15:34,429
- What? Is that a no? - That's a no.

330
00:15:34,430 --> 00:15:36,368
- I'm Koco. - He's Koco.

331
00:15:36,369 --> 00:15:37,699
The next performance...

332
00:15:37,700 --> 00:15:40,145
will be given by the youngest members.

333
00:15:40,640 --> 00:15:41,784
They're the youngest.

334
00:15:42,410 --> 00:15:44,838
Our three babies have prepared a song...

335
00:15:44,839 --> 00:15:47,309
that you will definitely love.

336
00:15:47,310 --> 00:15:49,748
Let's give it up for them!

337
00:15:49,749 --> 00:15:51,324
(Please welcome them with applause!)

338
00:15:52,280 --> 00:15:55,389
(Seok Jin and Ji Hyo finish everything without any mistakes.)

339
00:15:55,390 --> 00:15:56,988
- Good work. - You did well.

340
00:15:56,989 --> 00:15:58,258
You were terrific.

341
00:15:58,259 --> 00:15:59,929
- Seok Jin. - You were excellent.

342
00:15:59,930 --> 00:16:01,889
(They compliment each other and go backstage.)

343
00:16:01,890 --> 00:16:03,375
I was so nervous.

344
00:16:03,459 --> 00:16:04,958
It was really nerve-racking.

345
00:16:04,959 --> 00:16:06,128
(Now, they'll find out.)

346
00:16:06,129 --> 00:16:07,468
- Your hint. - What hint?

347
00:16:07,469 --> 00:16:08,699
- Did we... - Did we surpass it?

348
00:16:08,700 --> 00:16:10,515
- Did we? Seok Jin! - Okay, okay!

349
00:16:12,869 --> 00:16:16,755
(What was the highest decibels they got?)

350
00:16:16,780 --> 00:16:19,508
(It's 120dB.)

351
00:16:19,509 --> 00:16:21,309
Please pick 1 of the 3 hints.

352
00:16:21,310 --> 00:16:22,424
Do we each pick one?

353
00:16:22,780 --> 00:16:23,978
(Which hints will they receive?)

354
00:16:23,979 --> 00:16:25,654
This one? I pick the one you previously chose.

355
00:16:27,349 --> 00:16:29,958
(The spy likes cafes but not restaurants.)

356
00:16:29,959 --> 00:16:34,534
(The spy likes cafes but not restaurants?)

357
00:16:34,959 --> 00:16:37,775
Shouldn't you give us pens and paper?

358
00:16:37,829 --> 00:16:39,399
I think we need to use reasoning.

359
00:16:39,400 --> 00:16:41,328
(Who are these hints pointing at?)

360
00:16:41,329 --> 00:16:43,639
(The spy suits Friday, but doesn't suit Sunday.)

361
00:16:43,640 --> 00:16:44,845
(The spy likes cafes but not restaurants.)

362
00:16:45,900 --> 00:16:49,015
(This time, it's the 3 youngest members' stage.)

363
00:16:49,339 --> 00:16:52,108
(The prince appears.)

364
00:16:52,109 --> 00:16:55,008
(The audience cheers for him.)

365
00:16:55,009 --> 00:16:57,978
(Running Man in-depth exploration)

366
00:16:57,979 --> 00:17:00,995
(Lee Kwang Soo)

367
00:17:01,450 --> 00:17:03,289
(Everything he picks is a dud.)

368
00:17:03,290 --> 00:17:05,118
(Everything he chooses is a dud.)

369
00:17:05,119 --> 00:17:07,529
(Kwang Soo's mother)

370
00:17:07,530 --> 00:17:08,529
(Everything that he touches...)

371
00:17:08,530 --> 00:17:10,728
(turns into a dud.)

372
00:17:10,729 --> 00:17:13,405
(Kwang Soo is always the one who receives the penalties.)

373
00:17:13,799 --> 00:17:15,068
(Everyone is shocked at the penalties.)

374
00:17:15,069 --> 00:17:16,068
What is that?

375
00:17:16,069 --> 00:17:17,644
(Laughing)

376
00:17:17,870 --> 00:17:18,899
(It's an extreme-level penalty.)

377
00:17:18,900 --> 00:17:21,139
(And it's an extreme-level face.)

378
00:17:21,140 --> 00:17:23,238
(Is Kwang Soo a junior comedian?)

379
00:17:23,239 --> 00:17:25,109
(He's so ugly.)

380
00:17:25,110 --> 00:17:26,708
(I can't do it!)

381
00:17:26,709 --> 00:17:28,124
(I just can't!)

382
00:17:28,279 --> 00:17:29,748
(It's hard to say no...)

383
00:17:29,749 --> 00:17:33,394
(to this charming man.)

384
00:17:34,090 --> 00:17:37,765
(She's another person subjected to in-depth exploration.)

385
00:17:38,519 --> 00:17:41,304
(Jeon So Min)

386
00:17:41,890 --> 00:17:44,429
(Everyone cheers for her.)

387
00:17:44,430 --> 00:17:45,505
(So Min's parents)

388
00:17:45,999 --> 00:17:48,629
(Let's dig into So Min.)

389
00:17:48,630 --> 00:17:51,044
(She's known to be crazy.)

390
00:17:51,269 --> 00:17:54,738
(She has committed some unprecedented humiliation.)

391
00:17:54,739 --> 00:17:56,609
(In order to induce laughter,)

392
00:17:56,610 --> 00:17:57,679
(at times,)

393
00:17:57,680 --> 00:17:58,915
(she even shows some skin.)

394
00:17:59,580 --> 00:18:01,525
(She's known to sacrifice herself.)

395
00:18:01,979 --> 00:18:06,925
(She sacrifices herself to do what's right.)

396
00:18:07,549 --> 00:18:10,794
(I can't do this show anymore.)

397
00:18:11,190 --> 00:18:13,929
(She's the epitome of someone who's selfless.)

398
00:18:13,930 --> 00:18:16,134
(Mom, take out the deposit.)

399
00:18:16,759 --> 00:18:20,475
(Those in the green room burst into laughter.)

400
00:18:20,870 --> 00:18:22,629
(BS)

401
00:18:22,630 --> 00:18:26,215
(Yang Se Chan)

402
00:18:26,709 --> 00:18:29,339
(This is the last, youngest member.)

403
00:18:29,340 --> 00:18:31,755
(The audience is hyper.)

404
00:18:32,110 --> 00:18:34,854
(Let's dig into Se Chan this time.)

405
00:18:35,650 --> 00:18:37,525
(He's a comedian to the bone.)

406
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:40,089
(Having a runny nose is nothing.)

407
00:18:40,090 --> 00:18:43,534
(He's the number 1 lowly singer.)

408
00:18:43,690 --> 00:18:47,005
(The true comedian is finally here.)

409
00:18:47,660 --> 00:18:50,199
(He's known for his wits and for being reckless.)

410
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:53,245
(He always induces laughter.)

411
00:18:53,430 --> 00:18:54,429
You're out.

412
00:18:54,430 --> 00:18:57,314
(23 days before the fan-meet.)

413
00:18:57,440 --> 00:18:59,439
Will Kwang Soo sing Lee Jae Hoon's parts?

414
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:01,614
- Yes, he's the main vocalist. - Yes.

415
00:19:02,140 --> 00:19:03,978
I'll sing Kim Sung Su's parts.

416
00:19:03,979 --> 00:19:05,114
She'll sing Yu Ri's parts.

417
00:19:05,410 --> 00:19:07,054
Yesterday,

418
00:19:07,350 --> 00:19:09,008
we filmed a horror special.

419
00:19:09,009 --> 00:19:10,218
We overworked our throats.

420
00:19:10,219 --> 00:19:12,478
- Our throats are sore. - We screamed so much.

421
00:19:12,479 --> 00:19:13,518
(They're not in their best conditions.)

422
00:19:13,519 --> 00:19:15,949
It's not like you have to sing well anyway.

423
00:19:15,950 --> 00:19:18,294
(He tells the truth.)

424
00:19:18,890 --> 00:19:20,429
- What do you mean? - What do you mean?

425
00:19:20,430 --> 00:19:22,028
You said you trusted us.

426
00:19:22,029 --> 00:19:23,435
It's only an event.

427
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:25,699
- It'll work out. - Right.

428
00:19:25,700 --> 00:19:27,568
- He'll help out. - Yes, he will.

429
00:19:27,569 --> 00:19:29,544
- All right. - Thank you in advance.

430
00:19:30,100 --> 00:19:32,544
(Kwang Soo begins recording first.)

431
00:19:33,269 --> 00:19:37,114
(I struggled just as much as you did.)

432
00:19:38,739 --> 00:19:40,248
You have absolutely no emotions.

433
00:19:40,249 --> 00:19:42,485
(He tells the truth once more.)

434
00:19:43,009 --> 00:19:44,248
What are "emotions"?

435
00:19:44,249 --> 00:19:47,225
(English isn't Kwang Soo's specialty.)

436
00:19:47,350 --> 00:19:49,324
He's talking about your feelings.

437
00:19:50,390 --> 00:19:51,495
He's talking about your feelings.

438
00:19:51,890 --> 00:19:53,265
I got it.

439
00:19:53,430 --> 00:19:55,288
- All right, I got it. - You lack strength.

440
00:19:55,289 --> 00:19:57,604
Do you want to continue or take a rest?

441
00:19:58,299 --> 00:20:03,005
How... How... How about... How about I take a break?

442
00:20:03,029 --> 00:20:04,199
- Come out. - Okay.

443
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:05,439
Go on.

444
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:06,439
- Kwang Soo, sit down. - You did well.

445
00:20:06,440 --> 00:20:08,308
You truly live up to your name.

446
00:20:08,309 --> 00:20:11,114
- You said your throat was sore. - You sang well.

447
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:12,978
Your voice wasn't hoarse at all.

448
00:20:12,979 --> 00:20:15,079
Your voice was great, but your skin looks terrible.

449
00:20:15,080 --> 00:20:16,695
- You look really dry. - Seriously.

450
00:20:17,150 --> 00:20:20,089
Hold on. I'm the only one who got my makeup done,

451
00:20:20,090 --> 00:20:21,218
but my skin looks bad?

452
00:20:21,219 --> 00:20:22,619
(Hold on. I'm the only one who got my makeup done,)

453
00:20:22,620 --> 00:20:24,018
(but my skin looks bad?)

454
00:20:24,019 --> 00:20:27,659
(Even the Prince of Asia is getting old.)

455
00:20:27,660 --> 00:20:28,735
What is that?

456
00:20:29,999 --> 00:20:31,129
Is that a speaker?

457
00:20:31,130 --> 00:20:32,604
(What is he curious about?)

458
00:20:32,930 --> 00:20:35,945
(It's a machine used to treat your skin.)

459
00:20:36,430 --> 00:20:37,568
What is that?

460
00:20:37,569 --> 00:20:39,199
How could that be a speaker?

461
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:41,144
- Is it light? It looks like so. - Yes.

462
00:20:41,739 --> 00:20:42,939
What is that?

463
00:20:42,940 --> 00:20:44,185
(He looks dignified.)

464
00:20:45,779 --> 00:20:47,109
Is this right?

465
00:20:47,110 --> 00:20:48,854
- I can hear something. - What?

466
00:20:48,979 --> 00:20:50,449
- What is that? - I can see your face.

467
00:20:50,450 --> 00:20:51,624
I can see your face.

468
00:20:51,880 --> 00:20:53,695
- You can see me? - I can see your mouth too.

469
00:20:54,890 --> 00:20:56,089
Is this working?

470
00:20:56,090 --> 00:20:57,458
- Yes, I think so. - Yes.

471
00:20:57,459 --> 00:20:59,334
- Is it off? - It's off.

472
00:20:59,590 --> 00:21:01,235
Wouldn't it be too blinding...

473
00:21:01,430 --> 00:21:02,629
if the light doesn't turn off?

474
00:21:02,630 --> 00:21:05,028
No, you need the UV rays to have better skin.

475
00:21:05,029 --> 00:21:06,228
Infrared rays.

476
00:21:06,229 --> 00:21:07,429
(They're not UV rays.)

477
00:21:07,430 --> 00:21:09,099
- Right, that. - Infrared rays.

478
00:21:09,100 --> 00:21:11,245
- They shouldn't be UV rays. - You're right.

479
00:21:11,340 --> 00:21:12,869
- Wake up. - Okay.

480
00:21:12,870 --> 00:21:14,909
- I'll focus. - You must concentrate.

481
00:21:14,910 --> 00:21:16,015
(This mask company could go bankrupt thanks to you!)

482
00:21:16,410 --> 00:21:17,554
What?

483
00:21:17,779 --> 00:21:19,515
(Please focus, Se Chan.)

484
00:21:19,680 --> 00:21:21,478
(Fascinated)

485
00:21:21,479 --> 00:21:22,778
I think it's...

486
00:21:22,779 --> 00:21:24,579
- It's pink. - It's pink.

487
00:21:24,580 --> 00:21:26,119
- What is that? - It must be something else.

488
00:21:26,120 --> 00:21:27,894
Isn't this for clubbing?

489
00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:30,859
(After taking a rest,)

490
00:21:30,860 --> 00:21:33,859
(Kwang Soo continues recording.)

491
00:21:33,860 --> 00:21:37,359
(This time, he puts in his emotions.)

492
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:39,034
(Meanwhile, Se Chan puts in too much emotion.)

493
00:21:40,600 --> 00:21:43,415
(His blood vessels are visible.)

494
00:21:45,539 --> 00:21:49,955
(So Min finishes recording as well.)

495
00:21:50,479 --> 00:21:52,685
(They practice the choreography.)

496
00:21:53,180 --> 00:21:55,579
(They do their best to bring out the vibes from 1997.)

497
00:21:55,580 --> 00:21:56,978
That's good.

498
00:21:56,979 --> 00:21:58,124
(They do their best to bring out the vibes from 1997.)

499
00:21:58,350 --> 00:22:02,149
(They hope they can give COOL a rebirth.)

500
00:22:02,150 --> 00:22:03,488
We're going to make a parody.

501
00:22:03,489 --> 00:22:04,619
They're going to be exactly the same.

502
00:22:04,620 --> 00:22:06,265
I'm going to have the same hairstyle too.

503
00:22:06,890 --> 00:22:08,329
Her hairstyle used to be trendy back then.

504
00:22:08,330 --> 00:22:10,034
Sung Su wore a fedora.

505
00:22:10,600 --> 00:22:12,175
Kwang Soo would look hilarious.

506
00:22:12,600 --> 00:22:18,314
(How will their "Woman on the Beach" look?)

507
00:22:19,100 --> 00:22:22,745
("Woman on the Beach" by Kwang Soo, So Min, and Se Chan)

508
00:22:22,769 --> 00:22:25,685
(Only the dancers are seen on stage.)

509
00:22:27,110 --> 00:22:28,784
They're coming out from behind.

510
00:22:32,819 --> 00:22:35,495
(The real oldies begin.)

511
00:22:36,759 --> 00:22:41,235
(Hey, it's summer!)

512
00:22:41,959 --> 00:22:44,528
(Screaming)

513
00:22:44,529 --> 00:22:46,304
(So Min's father)

514
00:22:46,670 --> 00:22:49,775
(They start off with raised energy.)

515
00:22:50,440 --> 00:22:53,268
(Welcome to 1997.)

516
00:22:53,269 --> 00:22:56,215
(COOL has been reborn.)

517
00:22:57,209 --> 00:23:00,048
They're dressed just like what COOL used to dress.

518
00:23:00,049 --> 00:23:02,485
I thought they cut of the sleeves the prisoner outfits.

519
00:23:02,709 --> 00:23:03,925
(Laughing)

520
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:12,788
She's adorable.

521
00:23:12,789 --> 00:23:14,165
(She's adorable.)

522
00:23:21,529 --> 00:23:24,314
(The lead vocalist enters.)

523
00:23:28,370 --> 00:23:29,745
What are the clothes?

524
00:23:30,340 --> 00:23:31,655
He looks like Rain.

525
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:35,425
(Cool Kwang Soo)

526
00:23:38,819 --> 00:23:41,818
(Its familiar melody...)

527
00:23:41,819 --> 00:23:44,794
(quickly brings all generations together.)

528
00:23:51,330 --> 00:23:55,304
(Let's hurry off!)

529
00:23:58,039 --> 00:24:02,068
(The decibels rise as they reach the hook.)

530
00:24:02,069 --> 00:24:04,415
(The youngest of Running Man, go, go!)

531
00:24:19,620 --> 00:24:21,829
(Kwang Soo is the leader of the three,)

532
00:24:21,830 --> 00:24:23,998
(and So Min and Se Chan...)

533
00:24:23,999 --> 00:24:26,205
(join him for an adorable retro performance.)

534
00:24:27,330 --> 00:24:29,945
(The overly emotional Se Chan is up.)

535
00:24:30,670 --> 00:24:32,745
(Screaming)

536
00:24:33,610 --> 00:24:36,485
(Back and forth)

537
00:24:37,840 --> 00:24:39,985
(Perfect chemistry)

538
00:24:41,150 --> 00:24:43,624
(They're all in love with the two.)

539
00:24:54,989 --> 00:24:58,058
Make some noise!

540
00:24:58,059 --> 00:25:00,005
(Screaming)

541
00:25:00,330 --> 00:25:03,515
(Se Chan's plan worked and they're at 125dB.)

542
00:25:03,739 --> 00:25:05,538
During practice, Se Chan kept asking...

543
00:25:05,539 --> 00:25:07,415
when he should add that.

544
00:25:08,069 --> 00:25:10,215
- He really likes doing that. - Exactly.

545
00:25:10,309 --> 00:25:12,079
Make some noise!

546
00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:16,685
(The chant he prepared elevates the tension and mood.)

547
00:25:20,049 --> 00:25:24,718
(We'll forever be in love with our fans.)

548
00:25:24,719 --> 00:25:26,435
(We promise.)

549
00:25:27,590 --> 00:25:31,834
(Retro So Min, Lead vocalist Kwang Soo, Cheerleader Se Chan)

550
00:25:34,769 --> 00:25:38,844
(The three of them show off perfect harmony.)

551
00:25:39,069 --> 00:25:43,515
(Thanks to them, we went on a trip down memory lane.)

552
00:25:45,340 --> 00:25:47,824
(We're back to present time again.)

553
00:25:47,910 --> 00:25:51,025
(Great job!)

554
00:25:51,850 --> 00:25:54,048
(Even the recording artists agree.)

555
00:25:54,049 --> 00:25:55,124
It was perfect.

556
00:25:55,920 --> 00:25:57,235
(You guys are the best.)

557
00:25:59,160 --> 00:26:00,558
- Gosh, I'm so embarrassed. - Hello, everyone.

558
00:26:00,559 --> 00:26:02,089
- It's good to see you. - Hi.

559
00:26:02,090 --> 00:26:03,528
(The get a grip on themselves and greet the audience.)

560
00:26:03,529 --> 00:26:05,359
Let us properly say hello.

561
00:26:05,360 --> 00:26:06,705
Hello, I'm Kwang Soo.

562
00:26:06,759 --> 00:26:08,798
Hi, I'm So Min.

563
00:26:08,799 --> 00:26:12,175
Hi, I'm Se Chan. In 2, 3.

564
00:26:12,440 --> 00:26:13,609
We're GHOUL!

565
00:26:13,610 --> 00:26:16,114
(Not COOL but GHOUL)

566
00:26:16,509 --> 00:26:17,614
Right.

567
00:26:17,640 --> 00:26:19,609
Not COOL but GHOUL.

568
00:26:19,610 --> 00:26:21,048
- It's GHOUL. - That's right.

569
00:26:21,049 --> 00:26:24,048
From what I heard, this is supposed to air...

570
00:26:24,049 --> 00:26:26,449
- in September. - In the fall.

571
00:26:26,450 --> 00:26:28,349
- But... - We sang a summer song.

572
00:26:28,350 --> 00:26:30,594
- A summer song. - We said it so loudly too.

573
00:26:30,660 --> 00:26:32,318
- I know. - We didn't know...

574
00:26:32,319 --> 00:26:33,758
- it'll air in the fall. - It's still hot outside for us.

575
00:26:33,759 --> 00:26:35,205
We admit our wrongdoing...

576
00:26:35,229 --> 00:26:37,159
and promise that we'll never make this mistake again.

577
00:26:37,160 --> 00:26:38,359
We're very sorry.

578
00:26:38,360 --> 00:26:39,498
Did you have fun?

579
00:26:39,499 --> 00:26:41,228
- Yes. - Yes.

580
00:26:41,229 --> 00:26:44,139
Because of all the cheers and chants,

581
00:26:44,140 --> 00:26:45,139
I had a blast on stage as well.

582
00:26:45,140 --> 00:26:46,869
Me too.

583
00:26:46,870 --> 00:26:49,439
(Have some more then.)

584
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:51,038
- Thank you. - It's been insane.

585
00:26:51,039 --> 00:26:53,038
- Good. - So we should introduce who's next.

586
00:26:53,039 --> 00:26:54,124
- Right. - That's right.

587
00:26:54,410 --> 00:26:56,179
I see that a few things have been set up.

588
00:26:56,180 --> 00:26:57,548
- Four chairs. - Those indicate...

589
00:26:57,549 --> 00:26:58,919
a grand performance.

590
00:26:58,920 --> 00:27:02,048
Right, but less than four people are performing next from what I know.

591
00:27:02,049 --> 00:27:04,134
I know it as just one person.

592
00:27:04,459 --> 00:27:06,318
One person?

593
00:27:06,319 --> 00:27:07,689
Could it be him?

594
00:27:07,690 --> 00:27:11,359
Running Man's Sparta-Kook.

595
00:27:11,360 --> 00:27:14,498
The man with the muscles. It's his turn.

596
00:27:14,499 --> 00:27:16,228
- That's right. - Small chested.

597
00:27:16,229 --> 00:27:17,839
"Small," did you say?

598
00:27:17,840 --> 00:27:19,839
(Watch it, Kwang Soo.)

599
00:27:19,840 --> 00:27:21,708
- He can be petty. - Oh, I get it.

600
00:27:21,709 --> 00:27:23,068
That's why it's small?

601
00:27:23,069 --> 00:27:26,155
- He can be petty, that's all. - I know him as the opposite.

602
00:27:26,309 --> 00:27:28,824
So Min always takes the joke as far as she can.

603
00:27:28,979 --> 00:27:31,149
- So let's introduce him up here. - Sure.

604
00:27:31,150 --> 00:27:35,149
Please put it together for Kim Jong Kook.

605
00:27:35,150 --> 00:27:36,965
(Here is the muscular but petty Kim Jong Kook.)

606
00:27:37,390 --> 00:27:38,419
Thank you!

607
00:27:38,420 --> 00:27:40,134
(They applaud even when they're leaving the stage.)

608
00:27:40,459 --> 00:27:42,189
- I... - You were great.

609
00:27:42,190 --> 00:27:43,465
Was I any good?

610
00:27:43,630 --> 00:27:44,758
Did we do well?

611
00:27:44,759 --> 00:27:46,899
- We were amazing. - Kwang Soo, So Min, Se Chan,

612
00:27:46,900 --> 00:27:48,675
you reached 125dB,

613
00:27:48,799 --> 00:27:51,399
- which earns you a hint. - It was 125dB.

614
00:27:51,400 --> 00:27:53,475
- Nice. - We did really well.

615
00:27:53,610 --> 00:27:54,839
I asked them to scream during the song.

616
00:27:54,840 --> 00:27:56,808
Please choose 1 out of the 3.

617
00:27:56,809 --> 00:27:58,238
- Kwang Soo, go ahead. - You choose.

618
00:27:58,239 --> 00:27:59,238
(They treat him as the leader at times like this.)

619
00:27:59,239 --> 00:28:00,384
You're our leader.

620
00:28:00,549 --> 00:28:02,025
- Leader Lee. - Well...

621
00:28:02,549 --> 00:28:03,718
How about this?

622
00:28:03,719 --> 00:28:05,179
- This one? - The choice is yours.

623
00:28:05,180 --> 00:28:06,248
(Which hint did they choose?)

624
00:28:06,249 --> 00:28:08,449
- "The spy..." - "The spy..."

625
00:28:08,450 --> 00:28:09,649
"can be with balls",

626
00:28:09,650 --> 00:28:11,058
"but not dice".

627
00:28:11,059 --> 00:28:12,834
What does this mean?

628
00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:15,159
A ball is round while dice is a square.

629
00:28:15,160 --> 00:28:16,864
Could it be the Running Ball?

630
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:18,899
It can be with balls,

631
00:28:18,900 --> 00:28:20,344
- but not dice. - Not dice.

632
00:28:20,600 --> 00:28:21,599
- This... - It's too difficult.

633
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:22,975
The hints are tricky today.

634
00:28:23,299 --> 00:28:25,114
Do we keep this for now?

635
00:28:25,340 --> 00:28:27,538
- We need another one. - What do the numbers add up to?

636
00:28:27,539 --> 00:28:29,038
From 6 to 1, I mean.

637
00:28:29,039 --> 00:28:31,308
Well... 6 plus 5 plus 4 plus 3 plus 2 plus 1.

638
00:28:31,309 --> 00:28:34,308
Don't you think that's a bit too complicated for us?

639
00:28:34,309 --> 00:28:37,179
(Don't you think that's a bit too complicated for us?)

640
00:28:37,180 --> 00:28:38,619
That isn't the answer anyway.

641
00:28:38,620 --> 00:28:40,548
- Let's go for now. - Sure, let's go.

642
00:28:40,549 --> 00:28:41,548
(They aren't any closer to identifying the spy.)

643
00:28:41,549 --> 00:28:44,458
It can be with balls but not dice.

644
00:28:44,459 --> 00:28:45,834
(They aren't any closer to identifying the spy.)

645
00:28:47,830 --> 00:28:48,958
Want to see some tears?

646
00:28:48,959 --> 00:28:50,034
(Who's taking the stage after GHOUL?)

647
00:28:50,930 --> 00:28:52,334
(It's the man who can do anything.)

648
00:28:53,130 --> 00:28:54,129
Want to see some tears?

649
00:28:54,130 --> 00:28:57,574
(Kim Jong Kook)

650
00:28:57,900 --> 00:28:59,515
(It's not like I can mince you instead.)

651
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:00,945
(I could boil you guys, you know.)

652
00:29:02,410 --> 00:29:03,808
(A half-hearted joke...)

653
00:29:03,809 --> 00:29:06,515
(never feels like a joke with Jong Kook.)

654
00:29:06,709 --> 00:29:08,149
Behind you.

655
00:29:08,150 --> 00:29:11,894
(His history of victories had no hitches.)

656
00:29:13,019 --> 00:29:18,265
(Not even a player in the Major League could stop him.)

657
00:29:20,059 --> 00:29:22,965
(Who are we? We're Running Man!)

658
00:29:24,499 --> 00:29:27,804
(The man who only knows victories was challenged though.)

659
00:29:28,499 --> 00:29:31,844
(His opponent was the gold-medalist Yun Sung Bin.)

660
00:29:32,900 --> 00:29:34,839
- He couldn't possibly win. - Yun Sung Bin's fast.

661
00:29:34,840 --> 00:29:36,314
- That's impossible. - Get set...

662
00:29:36,670 --> 00:29:37,955
On your marks.

663
00:29:38,610 --> 00:29:41,525
(He challenges the gold-medalist to a 10m sprint.)

664
00:29:41,950 --> 00:29:45,425
(Will he keep his winning streak?)

665
00:29:46,479 --> 00:29:49,394
(A national team athlete versus Kim Jong Kook)

666
00:29:51,090 --> 00:29:52,735
(Tensions are high.)

667
00:29:53,959 --> 00:29:57,435
(A close match)

668
00:29:58,559 --> 00:30:00,034
- What? - That was fast.

669
00:30:00,299 --> 00:30:02,104
(Who won?)

670
00:30:03,529 --> 00:30:07,215
(Neck and neck)

671
00:30:09,140 --> 00:30:12,155
(Jong Kook won!)

672
00:30:13,039 --> 00:30:15,349
(Gosh...)

673
00:30:15,350 --> 00:30:16,425
How is that possible?

674
00:30:17,549 --> 00:30:20,324
(It's absurd, but he still won.)

675
00:30:21,090 --> 00:30:23,919
(Jong Kook even beat the gold-medalist.)

676
00:30:23,920 --> 00:30:25,334
Good job.

677
00:30:25,860 --> 00:30:28,435
(He's really good.)

678
00:30:29,489 --> 00:30:33,735
(He makes us forget that he's a singer sometimes.)

679
00:30:34,400 --> 00:30:38,738
(The famous soundtrack from the movie "Aladdin")

680
00:30:38,739 --> 00:30:41,415
("Speechless" featuring Princess Jasmine)

681
00:30:42,870 --> 00:30:48,624
(It's the song that was covered by female singers with high pitches.)

682
00:30:50,680 --> 00:30:54,225
(During the dry run)

683
00:30:56,090 --> 00:30:58,864
(They film Jong Kook as he sings.)

684
00:30:59,819 --> 00:31:05,505
(He fully prepares for the stage by checking sound and movement.)

685
00:31:05,559 --> 00:31:10,399
(What spin will he give to the song?)

686
00:31:10,400 --> 00:31:14,884

(He captivates the ladies' hearts.)

690

(He mesmerizes the audience with his sweet voice.)

691

(I am a singer.)

692
00:32:01,749 --> 00:32:06,134
(Jong Kook's voice is brought to us on top of string instruments.)

693
00:32:06,319 --> 00:32:11,134

(His beautiful voice is a treat to the ear.)

703

00:34:14,989 --> 00:34:18,195
His vocal cords must be squeezed by all his muscles.

712
00:34:19,089 --> 00:34:20,559
His key is so high.

713
00:34:20,560 --> 00:34:21,965
- Right? - It's a key for women.

714
00:34:23,259 --> 00:34:26,035
Hello, I'm Kim Jong Kook.

715
00:34:26,529 --> 00:34:27,599
Well...

716
00:34:27,600 --> 00:34:29,229
(Thanks for the beautiful song.)

717
00:34:29,230 --> 00:34:31,144
Your cheering was so loud...

718
00:34:31,939 --> 00:34:33,769
that I couldn't even hear the music well.

719
00:34:33,770 --> 00:34:35,544
Thank you so much.

720
00:34:35,770 --> 00:34:37,039
Running Man has...

721
00:34:37,040 --> 00:34:42,108
many young fans.

722
00:34:42,109 --> 00:34:45,179
That's why I sang a song from a movie loved by many people.

723
00:34:45,180 --> 00:34:46,449
Did you like it?

724
00:34:46,450 --> 00:34:48,718
- Yes! - I see.

725
00:34:48,719 --> 00:34:49,894
I was so nervous.

726
00:34:50,660 --> 00:34:51,865
Thank you.

727
00:34:51,890 --> 00:34:53,535
(Be my boyfriend.)

728
00:34:53,560 --> 00:34:54,829
This was...

729
00:34:54,830 --> 00:34:57,405
the last individual performance...

730
00:34:57,859 --> 00:34:59,374
we prepared.

731
00:34:59,600 --> 00:35:01,275
The next performance...

732
00:35:01,399 --> 00:35:03,974
is actually a penalty.

733
00:35:04,100 --> 00:35:05,999
Jae Seok and Haha...

734
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:09,309
prepared an amazing performance.

735
00:35:09,310 --> 00:35:11,285
Are you excited?

736
00:35:11,640 --> 00:35:13,238
- Yes! - Yes!

737
00:35:13,239 --> 00:35:14,525
Please enjoy.

738
00:35:14,549 --> 00:35:15,679
See you in a bit.

739
00:35:15,680 --> 00:35:19,624
(The performance starts shorty. Stay tuned.)

740
00:35:21,089 --> 00:35:22,318
(I'm still nervous.)

741
00:35:22,319 --> 00:35:23,564
Be careful.

742
00:35:23,919 --> 00:35:25,159
- Be careful. - Let's do it here.

743
00:35:25,160 --> 00:35:26,595
Here?

744
00:35:26,989 --> 00:35:28,164
Jong Kook.

745
00:35:28,189 --> 00:35:29,664
See how much you've got.

746
00:35:30,430 --> 00:35:32,459
The audience's cheering exceeded 120dB.

747
00:35:32,460 --> 00:35:34,168
- You won a hint. - It did?

748
00:35:34,169 --> 00:35:35,374
(He met the goal of 120dB.)

749
00:35:36,500 --> 00:35:40,039
(The audience's cheering...)

750
00:35:40,040 --> 00:35:43,644
(the loudest at the climax of the song.)

751
00:35:44,609 --> 00:35:46,539
(I did it.)

752
00:35:46,540 --> 00:35:47,679
All right.

753
00:35:47,680 --> 00:35:49,354
(What hint has he chosen?)

754
00:35:49,379 --> 00:35:51,354
I picked the one that dropped.

755
00:35:52,879 --> 00:35:55,418
"The spy likes cafes..."

756
00:35:55,419 --> 00:35:58,264
"but not restaurants."

757
00:35:58,689 --> 00:35:59,894
What?

758
00:36:00,520 --> 00:36:02,535
(The hints are confusing. Who is the spy?)

759
00:36:02,890 --> 00:36:03,988
All right.

760
00:36:03,989 --> 00:36:06,575
(The hints are confusing. Who is the spy?)

761
00:36:07,770 --> 00:36:09,599
(The audience is still filled with emotions after Jong Kook's ballad.)

762
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:11,414
(Jae Seok appears.)

763
00:36:11,870 --> 00:36:14,309
(Jae Seok appears on the screen with the theme song.)

764
00:36:14,310 --> 00:36:17,385
(The audience is excited.)

765
00:36:18,710 --> 00:36:22,224
(Yu Jae Seok)

766
00:36:23,710 --> 00:36:26,255
(His dance moves are hard to watch.)

767
00:36:26,879 --> 00:36:30,064
(He always does his best to be frivolous.)

768
00:36:30,649 --> 00:36:34,334
(And no one beats him when it comes to ugliness.)

769
00:36:34,960 --> 00:36:36,059
(His looks stir up the waiting room.)

770
00:36:36,060 --> 00:36:37,905
I love him.

771
00:36:38,399 --> 00:36:41,229
(He creates fun scenes with just one touch.)

772
00:36:41,230 --> 00:36:43,199
(By both luck and effort,)

773
00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:45,215
(he's become the number one entertainer.)

774
00:36:45,239 --> 00:36:46,369
Cameras, come!

775
00:36:46,370 --> 00:36:48,244
Cameras, come with us!

776
00:36:49,210 --> 00:36:54,878
(You don't want to miss a second. He is the best of the best.)

777
00:36:54,879 --> 00:36:56,409
(It's supposed to be a duet performance.)

778
00:36:56,410 --> 00:36:57,818
(Why is there only Jae Seok?)

779
00:36:57,819 --> 00:36:59,679
(Jae Seok's video is over.)

780
00:36:59,680 --> 00:37:02,119
(Just then)

781
00:37:02,120 --> 00:37:06,159
(We'll decide which members will do a duet performance.)

782
00:37:06,160 --> 00:37:09,088
(The race will determine which 2 members...)

783
00:37:09,089 --> 00:37:11,575
(will prepare a performance by themselves.)

784
00:37:11,660 --> 00:37:14,298
(No one wants to be chosen.)

785
00:37:14,299 --> 00:37:17,775
(Haha is chosen for the duet performance.)

786
00:37:18,739 --> 00:37:20,244
(And)

787
00:37:20,839 --> 00:37:23,985
(Jae Seok is chosen as Haha's partner.)

788
00:37:24,439 --> 00:37:26,438
(Yes! It's Jae Seok!)

789
00:37:26,439 --> 00:37:28,608
(This is how...)

790
00:37:28,609 --> 00:37:31,255
(Super-X's performance was decided.)

791
00:37:31,379 --> 00:37:35,195
(Duet performance by Super-X composed of Haha and Jae Seok)

792
00:37:35,390 --> 00:37:38,688
(The audience is excited to see the two sexy men's performance.)

793
00:37:38,689 --> 00:37:41,635
(The two sexy men are worried.)

794
00:37:41,730 --> 00:37:43,659
- Hi. - Oh, my.

795
00:37:43,660 --> 00:37:44,999
(Three months ago, Super-X met a songwriter.)

796
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:45,999
- Hello. - Hi.

797
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:47,329
He's the best songwriter.

798
00:37:47,330 --> 00:37:48,945
Haha chose him.

799
00:37:48,969 --> 00:37:52,738
(Songwriter Lim Kwang Wook)

800
00:37:52,739 --> 00:37:56,238
I'm the main producer of the songwriter group,

801
00:37:56,239 --> 00:37:59,385
Devine Channel. My name is Lim Kwang Wook.

802
00:37:59,410 --> 00:38:01,209
- Kwang Kook? - Lim Kwang Wook.

803
00:38:01,210 --> 00:38:02,555
- Kwang Wook? - Yes.

804
00:38:02,779 --> 00:38:04,954
Let me tell you how amazing he is.

805
00:38:05,020 --> 00:38:06,224
His songwriting is...

806
00:38:06,850 --> 00:38:09,865
world-class.

807
00:38:10,489 --> 00:38:13,164
In Korea, he writes songs for idol groups...

808
00:38:13,219 --> 00:38:14,789
I'm sure...

809
00:38:14,790 --> 00:38:16,459
he is very famous.

810
00:38:16,460 --> 00:38:19,128
That must be why you contacted him.

811
00:38:19,129 --> 00:38:21,668
But it'd be easiest if you tell me...

812
00:38:21,669 --> 00:38:23,468
- what songs he wrote. - Of course.

813
00:38:23,469 --> 00:38:24,639
- Exactly. - I'm curious.

814
00:38:24,640 --> 00:38:25,668
First of all,

815
00:38:25,669 --> 00:38:29,008
"Fire" by BTS.

816
00:38:29,009 --> 00:38:30,168
("Fire" by BTS)

817
00:38:30,169 --> 00:38:31,608
I wrote it...

818
00:38:31,609 --> 00:38:33,914
together with my colleagues.

819
00:38:33,980 --> 00:38:36,278
Stand up and greet him properly.

820
00:38:36,279 --> 00:38:38,249
Hit songs make us stand up.

821
00:38:38,250 --> 00:38:39,425
(Excuse my rudeness.)

822
00:38:39,779 --> 00:38:41,849
(Jae Seok automatically bows.)

823
00:38:41,850 --> 00:38:43,889
- I had no idea. - I'm so proud of him.

824
00:38:43,890 --> 00:38:46,664
You should have told me...

825
00:38:47,060 --> 00:38:49,465
"Fire"?

826
00:38:50,359 --> 00:38:52,305
- Did you... - So this is how it works.

827
00:38:52,529 --> 00:38:53,999
- What else? - And...

828
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:55,329
(If you need more information...)

829
00:38:55,330 --> 00:38:57,369
I wrote many songs for EXO.

830
00:38:57,370 --> 00:38:58,398
Stand up.

831
00:38:58,399 --> 00:39:01,184
(He wrote songs for EXO?)

832
00:39:01,540 --> 00:39:02,938
Shake hands.

833
00:39:02,939 --> 00:39:04,108
Who else? EXO?

834
00:39:04,109 --> 00:39:05,479
For EXO,

835
00:39:05,480 --> 00:39:07,539
I wrote, "Tender Love",

836
00:39:07,540 --> 00:39:09,548
"Baby, Don't Cry", "El Dorado", and so on.

837
00:39:09,549 --> 00:39:10,854
We should go see him.

838
00:39:11,020 --> 00:39:12,095
Let's do that.

839
00:39:12,850 --> 00:39:15,224
My goodness.

840
00:39:15,719 --> 00:39:18,334
- He's incredible. - He is.

841
00:39:18,359 --> 00:39:20,659
(And I contacted him.)

842
00:39:20,660 --> 00:39:22,159
You know Haha, right?

843
00:39:22,160 --> 00:39:23,628
How do you know each other?

844
00:39:23,629 --> 00:39:26,035
First of all,

845
00:39:26,060 --> 00:39:27,798
we don't know what to do ourselves.

846
00:39:27,799 --> 00:39:29,144
We're completely lost.

847
00:39:29,399 --> 00:39:32,068
The thing is, there aren't many male duos these days.

848
00:39:32,069 --> 00:39:33,338
You're right.

849
00:39:33,339 --> 00:39:35,338
- We used to have so many. - Deux.

850
00:39:35,339 --> 00:39:37,008
- Ryang Hyun Ryang Ha. - These days,

851
00:39:37,009 --> 00:39:39,584
the market is dominated by idol groups.

852
00:39:39,640 --> 00:39:41,954
It's hard to find male duos anymore.

853
00:39:42,149 --> 00:39:43,579
We can't find...

854
00:39:43,580 --> 00:39:46,095
any examples we can give you.

855
00:39:46,450 --> 00:39:49,648
(To find out their preferences, they listen to some songs.)

856
00:39:49,649 --> 00:39:52,164
This sounds so trendy.

857
00:39:53,660 --> 00:39:54,758
This is...

858
00:39:54,759 --> 00:39:56,128
(The electronic beat is a bit too trendy for them.)

859
00:39:56,129 --> 00:39:57,999
(Haha pretends to be enjoying the beat.)

860
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:00,135
It's so annoying when he does this.

861
00:40:01,870 --> 00:40:04,104
- It doesn't even suit him. - Gosh. This...

862
00:40:04,270 --> 00:40:05,738
To imagine I'd perform this with Jae Seok...

863
00:40:05,739 --> 00:40:07,039
This is not okay. Kwang Wook.

864
00:40:07,040 --> 00:40:09,014
This is too high-quality for us.

865
00:40:10,770 --> 00:40:13,285
All your music is so cool.

866
00:40:15,009 --> 00:40:16,048
If we perform this...

867
00:40:16,049 --> 00:40:17,108
(If we perform this...)

868
00:40:17,109 --> 00:40:18,278
If we do this...

869
00:40:18,279 --> 00:40:19,454
It'd be so annoying.

870
00:40:19,680 --> 00:40:20,849
It'd be terrible.

871
00:40:20,850 --> 00:40:22,624
(It'd be clumsy and comical.)

872
00:40:23,919 --> 00:40:27,119
(They keep listening to more music.)

873
00:40:27,120 --> 00:40:28,188
To be honest...

874
00:40:28,189 --> 00:40:29,329
(They're afraid the music is too trendy.)

875
00:40:29,330 --> 00:40:30,635
I love the music, but...

876
00:40:30,930 --> 00:40:32,099
I'll be honest.

877
00:40:32,100 --> 00:40:33,235
I'm not sure if we can pull this off.

878
00:40:33,500 --> 00:40:35,628
- Is it too difficult? - It's too difficult for us.

879
00:40:35,629 --> 00:40:38,414
You stopped grooving to the rhythm after a while too.

880
00:40:38,700 --> 00:40:40,115
I'll put it simply.

881
00:40:40,469 --> 00:40:42,668
We're very close anyway.

882
00:40:42,669 --> 00:40:43,869
Do you have any disco music?

883
00:40:43,870 --> 00:40:46,238
(They're old-fashioned.)

884
00:40:46,239 --> 00:40:47,278
(Is that what you wanted?)

885
00:40:47,279 --> 00:40:48,425
Hey.

886
00:40:48,680 --> 00:40:50,878
You shouldn't say that.

887
00:40:50,879 --> 00:40:53,479
I recently wrote...

888
00:40:53,480 --> 00:40:55,994
- some old-school music. - That sounds amazing.

889
00:40:56,689 --> 00:40:57,818
(Now he knows what they want.)

890
00:40:57,819 --> 00:40:59,918
- It's getting popular again. - The previous songs...

891
00:40:59,919 --> 00:41:01,564
are too high-quality for us.

892
00:41:02,430 --> 00:41:05,499
(What old-school song will the duo perform?)

893
00:41:05,500 --> 00:41:06,628
The main...

894
00:41:06,629 --> 00:41:07,699
- Hi. - Hi.

895
00:41:07,700 --> 00:41:09,028
I'm sorry, Kwang Wook.

896
00:41:09,029 --> 00:41:10,845
We were just penalized.

897
00:41:10,969 --> 00:41:12,575
We should have taken a shower before coming here.

898
00:41:12,939 --> 00:41:14,514
- The thing is... - How have you been?

899
00:41:14,540 --> 00:41:17,738
- We didn't have much time. - Right.

900
00:41:17,739 --> 00:41:19,008
So we just came straight here.

901
00:41:19,009 --> 00:41:20,039
(They're recording the song today.)

902
00:41:20,040 --> 00:41:21,325
This song...

903
00:41:21,410 --> 00:41:22,749
- It's the best. - This song...

904
00:41:22,750 --> 00:41:25,378
I'm not sure if we can pull it off. I'm sorry.

905
00:41:25,379 --> 00:41:27,055
I believe you can.

906
00:41:27,620 --> 00:41:29,218
(I trust you.)

907
00:41:29,219 --> 00:41:30,619
As soon as I played it, I got goosebumps.

908
00:41:30,620 --> 00:41:31,718
It's fantastic.

909
00:41:31,719 --> 00:41:33,758
The song is too good for us.

910
00:41:33,759 --> 00:41:36,035
It's too high-quality.

911
00:41:36,089 --> 00:41:37,905
In my opinion,

912
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:41,474
we should sing this in an obnoxious way.

913
00:41:41,629 --> 00:41:43,104
In an obnoxious way?

914
00:41:43,230 --> 00:41:44,539
(In an obnoxious way?)

915
00:41:44,540 --> 00:41:46,139
I think we should.

916
00:41:46,140 --> 00:41:48,938
Focus on delivering the feeling.

917
00:41:48,939 --> 00:41:50,945
- Okay. Let's listen to it. - Okay.

918
00:41:51,609 --> 00:41:53,639
I can't sing high notes these days.

919
00:41:53,640 --> 00:41:55,055
- It's not good. - First of all...

920
00:41:55,710 --> 00:41:58,818
(The song sounds amazing even from the very beginning.)

921
00:41:58,819 --> 00:42:00,755
(Guide vocal)

922
00:42:01,319 --> 00:42:03,849
(This is the first time the fans hear this song.)

923
00:42:03,850 --> 00:42:07,394
(They like it.)

924
00:42:08,359 --> 00:42:11,499
(The addictive intro is followed...)

925
00:42:11,500 --> 00:42:14,405
(by singing.)

926
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:18,244
When the fun rhythm starts flowing out

927
00:42:18,669 --> 00:42:20,345
A thrill passes through my body

928
00:42:21,270 --> 00:42:23,968
(The song doesn't only satisfy Generation X.)

929
00:42:23,969 --> 00:42:25,938
(All generations think it's a great song.)

930
00:42:25,939 --> 00:42:27,014
I like this song.

931
00:42:29,509 --> 00:42:31,825
(Hands above your head)

932
00:42:33,080 --> 00:42:35,064
(Why does he sound so hoarse?)

933
00:42:36,189 --> 00:42:37,789
- This part is... - We have to lower the key.

934
00:42:37,790 --> 00:42:39,459
(He can't hit the high notes.)

935
00:42:39,460 --> 00:42:40,535
Excuse me.

936
00:42:41,060 --> 00:42:42,434
- We have to lower the key. - Right.

937
00:42:42,960 --> 00:42:45,175
You can't hit the high notes at all.

938
00:42:45,600 --> 00:42:47,635
I told you as soon as we got this song.

939
00:42:48,870 --> 00:42:52,945
(We were going to do ballads.)

940
00:42:53,469 --> 00:42:56,008
(Haha starts recording first.)

941
00:42:56,009 --> 00:42:58,179
(Sing loudly after me.)

942
00:42:58,180 --> 00:42:59,354
I'm sorry.

943
00:42:59,379 --> 00:43:02,349
(Sing loudly after me.)

944
00:43:02,350 --> 00:43:03,709
I can only do this three times.

945
00:43:03,710 --> 00:43:05,695
(Haha's warning him.)

946
00:43:06,350 --> 00:43:07,519
My neck feels sore.

947
00:43:07,520 --> 00:43:09,025
(There are only 3 chances to record the high notes.)

948
00:43:09,589 --> 00:43:12,159
(He keeps on trying the high part.)

949
00:43:12,160 --> 00:43:14,059
(His voice is not in a good condition,)

950
00:43:14,060 --> 00:43:15,988
(so he's not satisfied.)

951
00:43:15,989 --> 00:43:17,628
Let's warm up your voice.

952
00:43:17,629 --> 00:43:19,758
- Okay. - Try the beginning.

953
00:43:19,759 --> 00:43:22,204
(Let's go, Jae Seok.)

954
00:43:23,069 --> 00:43:27,499
(His voice sounds stable.)

955
00:43:27,500 --> 00:43:29,744
(He's good.)

956
00:43:30,169 --> 00:43:32,709
(Is he rapping all of a sudden?)

957
00:43:32,710 --> 00:43:33,809
(He transforms from the main vocalist to a rapper.)

958
00:43:33,810 --> 00:43:36,249
This part feels rushed.

959
00:43:36,250 --> 00:43:38,979
- It's difficult to pronounce. - I agree.

960
00:43:38,980 --> 00:43:40,318
Can we change this?

961
00:43:40,319 --> 00:43:41,918
(That was random.)

962
00:43:41,919 --> 00:43:44,048
(He tries to negotiate with the songwriter.)

963
00:43:44,049 --> 00:43:45,159
Shake until you get tired

964
00:43:45,160 --> 00:43:46,519
How's this? We can omit "wildly".

965
00:43:46,520 --> 00:43:48,465
(He didn't hear Jae Seok.)

966
00:43:49,330 --> 00:43:50,389
(He tries again with the original lyrics.)

967
00:43:50,390 --> 00:43:51,559
I'll try again.

968
00:43:51,560 --> 00:43:53,229
(He tries again with the original lyrics.)

969
00:43:53,230 --> 00:43:54,628
(He's not confident.)

970
00:43:54,629 --> 00:43:55,668
Shake wildly

971
00:43:55,669 --> 00:43:58,499
- You have to emphasize that part. - Shake wildly

972
00:43:58,500 --> 00:44:00,499
Shake wildly until you get tired

973
00:44:00,500 --> 00:44:02,244
This is hard.

974
00:44:02,640 --> 00:44:03,914
Shake wildly

975
00:44:04,410 --> 00:44:06,209
(This is the next high part.)

976
00:44:06,210 --> 00:44:07,354
(Easily)

977
00:44:07,540 --> 00:44:09,385
- Let's go one more time. - Okay.

978
00:44:09,609 --> 00:44:11,918
(We don't know each other.)

979
00:44:11,919 --> 00:44:13,218
This is...

980
00:44:13,219 --> 00:44:14,249
(He was confident in the beginning,)

981
00:44:14,250 --> 00:44:18,258
(but he makes more mistakes as the parts get complicated.)

982
00:44:18,259 --> 00:44:20,619
It's easy like a midsummer night's dream

983
00:44:20,620 --> 00:44:22,164
(He's having a hard time.)

984
00:44:22,430 --> 00:44:25,505
(Will Jae Seok be okay?)

985
00:44:25,529 --> 00:44:27,459
(His condition doesn't improve.)

986
00:44:27,460 --> 00:44:28,945
This part is hard.

987
00:44:29,270 --> 00:44:30,968
I'll just use my voice,

988
00:44:30,969 --> 00:44:32,568
and if it doesn't work, I'll give up.

989
00:44:32,569 --> 00:44:34,275
(Will Jae Seok and Haha be okay?)

990
00:44:34,710 --> 00:44:36,568
(The members are practicing the group dance.)

991
00:44:36,569 --> 00:44:38,909
I can't do this.

992
00:44:38,910 --> 00:44:41,325
Five, six, shake it, shake it.

993
00:44:43,279 --> 00:44:47,119
(It's break time after a run-through.)

994
00:44:47,120 --> 00:44:48,394
That was awesome.

995
00:44:49,020 --> 00:44:52,559
(Jae Seok is practicing the couple performance.)

996
00:44:52,560 --> 00:44:56,934
(He practices while everybody else takes a break.)

997
00:44:57,160 --> 00:44:59,604
Do you know what time we're doing it with Apink?

998
00:44:59,799 --> 00:45:03,068
I think it's 5:30pm.

999
00:45:03,069 --> 00:45:04,329
One...

1000
00:45:04,330 --> 00:45:08,184
(They go over the dance moves together.)

1001
00:45:08,910 --> 00:45:11,684
(Watch the giraffe in the back.)

1002
00:45:12,779 --> 00:45:14,479
(The older members are working hard,)

1003
00:45:14,480 --> 00:45:16,785
(so he can't just watch.)

1004
00:45:17,680 --> 00:45:20,195
(Fluttering)

1005
00:45:20,680 --> 00:45:23,425
(I did my best.)

1006
00:45:24,549 --> 00:45:28,905
(They practice after the others leave.)

1007
00:45:29,560 --> 00:45:31,229
(They lean the microphone stands...)

1008
00:45:31,230 --> 00:45:34,035
(at the same time.)

1009
00:45:35,770 --> 00:45:38,445
(Their movements are not the same.)

1010
00:45:39,739 --> 00:45:43,639
(They didn't bring the stand back at the same time.)

1011
00:45:43,640 --> 00:45:44,909
Let's try again.

1012
00:45:44,910 --> 00:45:46,838
Listen to the first part.

1013
00:45:46,839 --> 00:45:48,249
Memorize the song.

1014
00:45:48,250 --> 00:45:49,608
(Memorize the movements with the song.)

1015
00:45:49,609 --> 00:45:50,724
I'm getting confused.

1016
00:45:50,910 --> 00:45:54,479
(Jae Seok tries by himself.)

1017
00:45:54,480 --> 00:45:56,394
- 1, 2? - Yes.

1018
00:45:56,489 --> 00:45:57,749
(He tries the 2nd time.)

1019
00:45:57,750 --> 00:46:00,389
- 1, 2. - You were too fast.

1020
00:46:00,390 --> 00:46:04,135
(He tries the 3rd time with the producer.)

1021
00:46:04,700 --> 00:46:07,229
(He's accurate.)

1022
00:46:07,230 --> 00:46:10,269
(Jae Seok misses it the 3rd time.)

1023
00:46:10,270 --> 00:46:11,938
Count for him in the back.

1024
00:46:11,939 --> 00:46:14,514
He needs it.

1025
00:46:14,839 --> 00:46:17,639
I focus on hearing the song too much.

1026
00:46:17,640 --> 00:46:20,938
(Will Super-X be fine during the actual performance?)

1027
00:46:20,939 --> 00:46:22,925
(Good luck, Jae Seok!)

1028
00:46:23,750 --> 00:46:27,124
(Dress rehearsal, the day before the concert)

1029
00:46:27,819 --> 00:46:29,619
(Jae Seok is trying out the moves.)

1030
00:46:29,620 --> 00:46:31,488
- This is too close. - Is it too close?

1031
00:46:31,489 --> 00:46:32,764
(He expresses his opinion.)

1032
00:46:33,520 --> 00:46:34,934
Jae Seok.

1033
00:46:34,989 --> 00:46:37,789
You look more excited here than when you are with me and SORAN.

1034
00:46:37,790 --> 00:46:40,298
- What? - You look more excited here.

1035
00:46:40,299 --> 00:46:41,405
Right.

1036
00:46:41,969 --> 00:46:44,204
(He doesn't deny it.)

1037
00:46:44,469 --> 00:46:45,798
He agreed.

1038
00:46:45,799 --> 00:46:47,269
I'm a guest in that group,

1039
00:46:47,270 --> 00:46:49,068
- and here, - He's the main vocalist.

1040
00:46:49,069 --> 00:46:50,269
I'm the main vocalist.

1041
00:46:50,270 --> 00:46:51,738
This is my main group.

1042
00:46:51,739 --> 00:46:52,838
(This is actually my main group.)

1043
00:46:52,839 --> 00:46:53,909
- Main group. - Jae Seok.

1044
00:46:53,910 --> 00:46:56,179
(He makes the distinction clearly.)

1045
00:46:56,180 --> 00:46:58,979
(The rehearsal starts.)

1046
00:46:58,980 --> 00:47:00,918
(This is the part that gave them trouble.)

1047
00:47:00,919 --> 00:47:03,294
(He's a beat too fast.)

1048
00:47:04,419 --> 00:47:07,918
(It's perfect this time.)

1049
00:47:07,919 --> 00:47:11,164
(They're an exact copy of each other.)

1050
00:47:14,100 --> 00:47:17,044
(This song is fun.)

1051
00:47:18,540 --> 00:47:22,215
(The rehearsal is over.)

1052
00:47:23,569 --> 00:47:25,115
- One more time? - Awesome.

1053
00:47:25,180 --> 00:47:27,479
(He's passionate as the main vocalist.)

1054
00:47:27,480 --> 00:47:29,809
(They practice again for a better performance.)

1055
00:47:29,810 --> 00:47:31,525
It's such a great song.

1056
00:47:32,080 --> 00:47:33,595
It's really good.

1057
00:47:35,020 --> 00:47:37,289
If you're ready, let's get started.

1058
00:47:37,290 --> 00:47:38,389
Stand by.

1059
00:47:38,390 --> 00:47:40,664
(They are passionate about the song. How will Super-X's performance be?)

1060
00:47:41,730 --> 00:47:44,088
(The performance begins.)

1061
00:47:44,089 --> 00:47:47,434
(Jae Seok and Haha are nervous as they wait.)

1062
00:47:48,299 --> 00:47:50,568
(They're very nervous,)

1063
00:47:50,569 --> 00:47:54,275
(and the fans cheer for them.)

1064
00:47:55,969 --> 00:48:00,115
("Hollywood" by Super-X)

1065
00:48:01,699 --> 00:48:03,968
(They're very nervous,)

1066
00:48:03,969 --> 00:48:08,475
(and the fans cheer for them.)

1067
00:48:10,169 --> 00:48:14,239
("Hollywood" by Super-X)

1068
00:48:14,240 --> 00:48:17,824
(They lean at the same time.)

1069
00:48:19,949 --> 00:48:22,049
(They touch their chests, and straighten the microphone stands.)

1070
00:48:22,050 --> 00:48:24,689
(They point their toes.)

1071
00:48:24,690 --> 00:48:27,189
(That was perfect teamwork.)

1072
00:48:27,190 --> 00:48:28,665
(That was amazing!)

1073
00:48:43,940 --> 00:48:45,738
- Haha's so good. - He's good.

1074
00:48:45,739 --> 00:48:47,515
That outfits suit them perfectly.

1075
00:48:49,179 --> 00:48:53,154
(Their colorful outfits suit their Generation X vibe.)

1076
00:48:53,179 --> 00:48:54,718
(We're...)

1077
00:48:54,719 --> 00:48:57,524
(the Super-X generation.)

1078
00:49:07,730 --> 00:49:10,605
(The cheer almost reaches 110dB.)

1079
00:49:15,940 --> 00:49:17,109
This is really good.

1080
00:49:17,110 --> 00:49:18,238
(This song is really good.)

1081
00:49:18,239 --> 00:49:19,785
(She copies the wiper movement.)

1082
00:49:19,980 --> 00:49:21,709
(This is...)

1083
00:49:21,710 --> 00:49:24,055
(the old sexy.)

1084
00:49:24,380 --> 00:49:27,995
(You somehow fall for these middle-aged men.)

1085
00:49:44,500 --> 00:49:47,714
(Now it's the footwork part.)

1086
00:49:49,639 --> 00:49:54,055
(They tap dance to the beat.)

1087
00:49:54,210 --> 00:49:56,249
(They show off their controlled footwork,)

1088
00:49:56,250 --> 00:49:58,908
(and turn away nonchalantly.)

1089
00:49:58,909 --> 00:50:01,625
(Let's go!)

1090
00:50:03,090 --> 00:50:05,819
(They move forward.)

1091
00:50:05,820 --> 00:50:07,959
(Raise the volume)

1092
00:50:07,960 --> 00:50:10,904
(The decibels rise above 110.)

1093
00:50:33,619 --> 00:50:36,125
(Here's the chorus.)

1094
00:50:41,889 --> 00:50:43,765
(This is so much fun.)

1095
00:50:44,929 --> 00:50:47,875
(They show off their old dance moves.)

1096
00:50:48,429 --> 00:50:52,105
(The super duo excites the fans.)

1097
00:51:01,280 --> 00:51:05,848
(However, the audience's cheer hasn't surpassed 120dB.)

1098
00:51:05,849 --> 00:51:08,649
(He hits high notes.)

1099
00:51:08,650 --> 00:51:10,419
(And then,)

1100
00:51:10,420 --> 00:51:13,618
(he moves his hips.)

1101
00:51:13,619 --> 00:51:16,165
- Make some noise! - Let's go!

1102
00:51:16,929 --> 00:51:21,305
(This is the real climax.)

1103
00:51:21,530 --> 00:51:25,098
(They summon the Generation X dance moves.)

1104
00:51:25,099 --> 00:51:27,198
(The decibels rise again at the climax.)

1105
00:51:27,199 --> 00:51:29,308
(They surpassed 120dB.)

1106
00:51:29,309 --> 00:51:31,138
(This is awesome.)

1107
00:51:31,139 --> 00:51:33,185
(This is getting heated.)

1108
00:51:33,809 --> 00:51:37,408
(Jae Seok and Haha are excited, and the mood is cheerful.)

1109
00:51:37,409 --> 00:51:38,984
Five, six.

1110
00:51:39,210 --> 00:51:40,654
(They pause.)

1111
00:51:42,219 --> 00:51:44,765
(They both move their hips.)

1112
00:51:45,019 --> 00:51:48,935
(The atmosphere peaks with the double body waves.)

1113
00:51:49,730 --> 00:51:50,788
(That's old sexy.)

1114
00:51:50,789 --> 00:51:51,828
Is this how they dance?

1115
00:51:51,829 --> 00:51:54,975
(The fans are in love with Super-X already.)

1116
00:51:55,460 --> 00:51:57,268
("Hollywood" reflected the Generation X vibe.)

1117
00:51:57,269 --> 00:51:58,745
Super-X.

1118
00:52:02,070 --> 00:52:03,614
That was nice.

1119
00:52:05,809 --> 00:52:07,154
That was very nice.

1120
00:52:07,179 --> 00:52:08,915
The dance moves they showed at the end were modern.

1121
00:52:09,079 --> 00:52:10,355
They did this.

1122
00:52:10,809 --> 00:52:12,549
- Thank you. - Thank you.

1123
00:52:12,550 --> 00:52:14,749
I am sorry for pretending to be sexy.

1124
00:52:14,750 --> 00:52:17,549
We are Super-X.

1125
00:52:17,550 --> 00:52:18,848
That's right. Super-X.

1126
00:52:18,849 --> 00:52:20,464
We resist the existing regulations.

1127
00:52:20,519 --> 00:52:21,734
We are the X-generation.

1128
00:52:22,219 --> 00:52:25,629
It's time to wrap up Part One.

1129
00:52:25,630 --> 00:52:28,799
That's right. Three months of work is passing by so quickly.

1130
00:52:28,800 --> 00:52:31,069
- I know. - I feel disappointed...

1131
00:52:31,070 --> 00:52:33,069
and sentimental at the same time.

1132
00:52:33,070 --> 00:52:35,899
All right. When this episode airs, I won't be home.

1133
00:52:35,900 --> 00:52:37,509
(When this episode airs, I won't be home.)

1134
00:52:37,510 --> 00:52:38,509
(He is too embarrassed to watch the performances.)

1135
00:52:38,510 --> 00:52:40,339
- I already made appointments. - I see.

1136
00:52:40,340 --> 00:52:44,049
All right. For Running Man's fan-meet,

1137
00:52:44,050 --> 00:52:46,319
- we invited guest singers. - That's right.

1138
00:52:46,320 --> 00:52:48,448
- Who are they? - Part One will be wrapped up...

1139
00:52:48,449 --> 00:52:49,848
by the artists who are the most popular these days.

1140
00:52:49,849 --> 00:52:51,948
Please give them a round of applause.

1141
00:52:51,949 --> 00:52:53,759
(Which guest singers ran over for Running Man's fan-meet?)

1142
00:52:53,760 --> 00:52:55,094
(Running Man's Fan-Meet: Nine Years of Running Man)

1143
00:52:55,659 --> 00:52:56,765
Who are they?

1144
00:52:57,489 --> 00:53:00,299
(The couple performance they worked hard on is over.)

1145
00:53:00,300 --> 00:53:01,299
We did a good job.

1146
00:53:01,300 --> 00:53:02,629
- Jae Seok and Haha, - What is this?

1147
00:53:02,630 --> 00:53:05,029
the cheer for your performance reached 121dB.

1148
00:53:05,030 --> 00:53:06,768
You succeeded to acquire a hint.

1149
00:53:06,769 --> 00:53:08,669
- Please choose a hint. - All right.

1150
00:53:08,670 --> 00:53:09,785
(Which hint did Jae Seok and Haha pick?)

1151
00:53:10,039 --> 00:53:12,245
(The spy likes cafes but not restaurants.)

1152
00:53:12,539 --> 00:53:14,439
"The spy likes cafes..." What is this?

1153
00:53:14,440 --> 00:53:15,515
(The spy likes cafes but not restaurants.)

1154
00:53:16,449 --> 00:53:18,254
I know who the spy is. Okay.

1155
00:53:19,050 --> 00:53:20,178
What is it?

1156
00:53:20,179 --> 00:53:21,419
(Did Haha figure out who the spy is?)

1157
00:53:21,420 --> 00:53:22,524
What does this mean?

1158
00:53:22,719 --> 00:53:23,794
- Okay. - Cafes?

1159
00:53:23,820 --> 00:53:25,049
What does this mean?

1160
00:53:25,050 --> 00:53:26,294
I know who the spy is.

1161
00:53:26,619 --> 00:53:28,218
Let's find the spy.

1162
00:53:28,219 --> 00:53:29,319
Yes.

1163
00:53:29,320 --> 00:53:31,158
- Everyone received a hint, right? - That's right.

1164
00:53:31,159 --> 00:53:32,229
Shall we share the hints?

1165
00:53:32,230 --> 00:53:34,305
But the hints...

1166
00:53:34,699 --> 00:53:36,205
- I will tell you mine. - What is it?

1167
00:53:36,829 --> 00:53:39,169
(It's rare for Seok Jin to share his hint so readily.)

1168
00:53:39,170 --> 00:53:40,799
"Monday..."

1169
00:53:40,800 --> 00:53:42,439
("Monday...")

1170
00:53:42,440 --> 00:53:43,439
Gosh, I forgot.

1171
00:53:43,440 --> 00:53:44,509
Seok Jin.

1172
00:53:44,510 --> 00:53:45,509
What was it?

1173
00:53:45,510 --> 00:53:46,808
- Didn't you receive the same hint? - What was it?

1174
00:53:46,809 --> 00:53:48,808
I received the same hint, right?

1175
00:53:48,809 --> 00:53:50,549
- What was it? - I became suspicious of him now...

1176
00:53:50,550 --> 00:53:52,049
- since he said something different. - I forgot.

1177
00:53:52,050 --> 00:53:53,848
- "The spy suits Friday..." - Seok Jin.

1178
00:53:53,849 --> 00:53:56,364
This is a fan-meet. This isn't the right time...

1179
00:53:56,920 --> 00:53:58,049
to seek attention.

1180
00:53:58,050 --> 00:53:59,348
- "The spy doesn't suit Sunday." - What?

1181
00:53:59,349 --> 00:54:01,859
"The spy likes Friday, but doesn't like Monday."

1182
00:54:01,860 --> 00:54:03,229
Doesn't that apply to everyone?

1183
00:54:03,230 --> 00:54:05,229
- That's right. - Everyone likes Friday.

1184
00:54:05,230 --> 00:54:07,605
- Seriously. - I will share another hint.

1185
00:54:07,760 --> 00:54:10,229
"The spy likes cafes, but not restaurants."

1186
00:54:10,230 --> 00:54:12,274
- Did you receive that hint? - Yes.

1187
00:54:12,429 --> 00:54:13,839
What was the hint we received?

1188
00:54:13,840 --> 00:54:14,939
What was it?

1189
00:54:14,940 --> 00:54:17,638
"The spy suits balls, but not dice."

1190
00:54:17,639 --> 00:54:18,745
What?

1191
00:54:19,340 --> 00:54:21,015
I have no idea who the spy is.

1192
00:54:21,710 --> 00:54:23,685
(As the deductions continue, the guest singers enter the stage.)

1193
00:54:24,150 --> 00:54:26,419
(This is incredible.)

1194
00:54:26,420 --> 00:54:30,419
(The surprise guest singers are ITZY.)

1195
00:54:30,420 --> 00:54:32,325
(I can't believe ITZY is here.)

1196
00:54:33,989 --> 00:54:38,504
("Dalla Dalla" by ITZY)

1197
00:54:42,829 --> 00:54:44,044
(Speechless)

1198
00:54:53,179 --> 00:54:59,424
(Running Man's fan-meet has a variety of performances.)

1199
00:54:59,849 --> 00:55:01,995
(I am so excited.)

1200
00:55:06,760 --> 00:55:08,134
(I am different.)

1201
00:55:09,489 --> 00:55:11,705
- Hello. - Hello.

1202
00:55:12,230 --> 00:55:13,499
(The members and artists finally come together.)

1203
00:55:13,500 --> 00:55:14,629
All right.

1204
00:55:14,630 --> 00:55:16,029
- Good job. - Hello.

1205
00:55:16,030 --> 00:55:18,069
- I bet you were really lonely. - I was so bored.

1206
00:55:18,070 --> 00:55:19,375
You were bored, right?

1207
00:55:19,699 --> 00:55:21,299
(Ji Hyo and Se Chan changed into the stage costumes.)

1208
00:55:21,300 --> 00:55:23,645
- Ji Hyo. - You look cool.

1209
00:55:23,840 --> 00:55:25,038
How was my rap?

1210
00:55:25,039 --> 00:55:26,654
It was amazing.

1211
00:55:26,809 --> 00:55:27,879
(I will show you one more time.)

1212
00:55:27,880 --> 00:55:29,178
- It was okay, right? - It was amazing.

1213
00:55:29,179 --> 00:55:30,448
- It was a live performance. - We screamed.

1214
00:55:30,449 --> 00:55:32,879
- Really? - We were so surprised.

1215
00:55:32,880 --> 00:55:34,094
I practiced so hard.

1216
00:55:34,150 --> 00:55:36,325
You did a good job.

1217
00:55:36,519 --> 00:55:37,749
It was great.

1218
00:55:37,750 --> 00:55:39,959
I am so embarrassed. It's driving me crazy.

1219
00:55:39,960 --> 00:55:41,089
It was great.

1220
00:55:41,090 --> 00:55:42,928
Se Chan, you did a great job.

1221
00:55:42,929 --> 00:55:44,529
- You are too kind. Let's sit down. - You did a great job.

1222
00:55:44,530 --> 00:55:46,029
Let's sit down.

1223
00:55:46,030 --> 00:55:47,959
I didn't get to watch the beginning.

1224
00:55:47,960 --> 00:55:49,375
How did you channel Hwasa?

1225
00:55:49,429 --> 00:55:50,629
Ji Hyo, you were so pretty.

1226
00:55:50,630 --> 00:55:52,205
Seriously.

1227
00:55:52,230 --> 00:55:53,538
We became a fan.

1228
00:55:53,539 --> 00:55:55,439
- Don't be like that. - Seriously.

1229
00:55:55,440 --> 00:55:56,638
- My goodness. - You are so cool.

1230
00:55:56,639 --> 00:55:57,738
They tease relentlessly.

1231
00:55:57,739 --> 00:55:59,408
Stop it already.

1232
00:55:59,409 --> 00:56:00,979
Stop teasing her.

1233
00:56:00,980 --> 00:56:02,509
- Stop it. - Don't be like that.

1234
00:56:02,510 --> 00:56:04,808
Didn't Ji Hyo and Seok Jin make a mistake?

1235
00:56:04,809 --> 00:56:06,718
- We made many small mistakes. - Like what?

1236
00:56:06,719 --> 00:56:09,055
He suddenly poured real alcohol.

1237
00:56:09,320 --> 00:56:11,089
- That's right. - I was so surprised.

1238
00:56:11,090 --> 00:56:13,435
I poured wine. I didn't do that during rehearsal.

1239
00:56:14,289 --> 00:56:16,194
(Seok Jin did something that was unplanned.)

1240
00:56:16,860 --> 00:56:18,589
(Pouring)

1241
00:56:18,590 --> 00:56:21,605
(It was an ad-lib that came from the good mood.)

1242
00:56:22,059 --> 00:56:24,004
Running Man is for those who are 12 years old and older.

1243
00:56:24,030 --> 00:56:25,428
It was grape juice.

1244
00:56:25,429 --> 00:56:26,439
(Don't be mistaken.)

1245
00:56:26,440 --> 00:56:28,499
- Really? - It was grape juice, not wine.

1246
00:56:28,500 --> 00:56:31,145
I want to talk to that man in the middle.

1247
00:56:31,309 --> 00:56:33,408
- Yes? - Do you practice martial arts?

1248
00:56:33,409 --> 00:56:35,754
Yes. Hello.

1249
00:56:36,449 --> 00:56:38,249
That's not how you do a kick.

1250
00:56:38,250 --> 00:56:40,049
- Really? Did I do it wrong? - Yes.

1251
00:56:40,050 --> 00:56:41,448
Maybe he was copying "The Gang".

1252
00:56:41,449 --> 00:56:43,518
- "The Gang". - Maybe he was copying "The Gang".

1253
00:56:43,519 --> 00:56:44,618
(Were you copying me?)

1254
00:56:44,619 --> 00:56:47,265
- "The Gang". - Why would I copy that?

1255
00:56:47,659 --> 00:56:50,689
It looked as if you were holding something.

1256
00:56:50,690 --> 00:56:52,234
In the performance of a COOL's song,

1257
00:56:52,329 --> 00:56:54,598
Kwang Soo wore a vest.

1258
00:56:54,599 --> 00:56:56,129
He did it to show off his muscles.

1259
00:56:56,130 --> 00:56:58,029
I didn't show off. Lee Jae Hoon of COOL...

1260
00:56:58,030 --> 00:56:59,428
Then why did you get tanned?

1261
00:56:59,429 --> 00:57:00,968
- There were no muscles to show off. - What?

1262
00:57:00,969 --> 00:57:02,538
- I didn't show off. - What were you showing off?

1263
00:57:02,539 --> 00:57:03,609
I didn't show off.

1264
00:57:03,610 --> 00:57:05,808
Why did you do push-ups in the waiting room?

1265
00:57:05,809 --> 00:57:07,779
- Did he do push-ups? - I didn't do push-ups!

1266
00:57:07,780 --> 00:57:09,439
- I did it since I was nervous. - You were determined to show off.

1267
00:57:09,440 --> 00:57:11,078
- Seriously. - I was nervous.

1268
00:57:11,079 --> 00:57:12,549
- Did you do push-ups? - He was pumping up his muscles.

1269
00:57:12,550 --> 00:57:13,618
- Yes. - My goodness.

1270
00:57:13,619 --> 00:57:15,049
- I will be honest. - I hope you succeed.

1271
00:57:15,050 --> 00:57:16,448
(I will be honest.)

1272
00:57:16,449 --> 00:57:18,718
I did do push-ups. But next to me...

1273
00:57:18,719 --> 00:57:22,558
(I will reveal everything.)

1274
00:57:22,559 --> 00:57:24,058
So Min did push-ups too.

1275
00:57:24,059 --> 00:57:26,058
(Kwang Soo drags So Min down with him.)

1276
00:57:26,059 --> 00:57:27,698
- Why did you do push-ups? - Who?

1277
00:57:27,699 --> 00:57:28,759
So Min did push-ups too.

1278
00:57:28,760 --> 00:57:30,928
- I can explain. - Did So Min do push-ups?

1279
00:57:30,929 --> 00:57:32,169
The neckline of my outfit was a bit low,

1280
00:57:32,170 --> 00:57:33,638
- so I wanted to pump up my muscles. - So Min...

1281
00:57:33,639 --> 00:57:35,038
- isn't used to such outfits. - For two days,

1282
00:57:35,039 --> 00:57:37,015
So Min didn't have a proper meal.

1283
00:57:37,039 --> 00:57:38,808
- She might collapse on the stage. - I am hungry.

1284
00:57:38,809 --> 00:57:40,585
So Min pumped up her muscles.

1285
00:57:41,239 --> 00:57:44,285
I wore a prisoner's uniform for the opening.

1286
00:57:44,309 --> 00:57:46,178
I was so embarrassed.

1287
00:57:46,179 --> 00:57:47,848
I forgot about it at first because of the audience's cheer.

1288
00:57:47,849 --> 00:57:50,549
Everyone in the audience knows the color of your underwear now.

1289
00:57:50,550 --> 00:57:51,625
My goodness.

1290
00:57:51,920 --> 00:57:53,419
You could see the color, right?

1291
00:57:53,420 --> 00:57:54,518
That's right.

1292
00:57:54,519 --> 00:57:56,888
The audience cheered so loudly...

1293
00:57:56,889 --> 00:57:59,029
- that I forgot for a second. - Upon seeing the underwear,

1294
00:57:59,030 --> 00:58:00,658
a lot of people became disappointed.

1295
00:58:00,659 --> 00:58:02,035
(Haha keeps going.)

1296
00:58:02,400 --> 00:58:04,598
(Dear fans, I am sorry for disappointing you.)

1297
00:58:04,599 --> 00:58:06,439
Haha. My goodness.

1298
00:58:06,440 --> 00:58:07,669
- Jae Seok. - What?

1299
00:58:07,670 --> 00:58:09,274
- Didn't you hear the sound? - What sound?

1300
00:58:09,469 --> 00:58:11,509
(I am disappointed.)

1301
00:58:11,510 --> 00:58:12,585
For goodness' sake.

1302
00:58:13,139 --> 00:58:14,939
- Didn't you hear the sound? - What are you talking about?

1303
00:58:14,940 --> 00:58:16,448
All of us heard it.

1304
00:58:16,449 --> 00:58:18,549
- For goodness' sake. - The moment they saw it,

1305
00:58:18,550 --> 00:58:20,154
they were like...

1306
00:58:20,320 --> 00:58:22,149
The three of you should react.

1307
00:58:22,150 --> 00:58:23,319
(He takes out his anger on other people.)

1308
00:58:23,320 --> 00:58:24,319
(They get yelled at for no reason.)

1309
00:58:24,320 --> 00:58:27,259
From the back, it looks like...

1310
00:58:27,260 --> 00:58:28,835
SORAN is at a wedding.

1311
00:58:29,119 --> 00:58:30,928
Seriously. It looks like they are waiting...

1312
00:58:30,929 --> 00:58:34,029
for the wedding to end so that they can eat.

1313
00:58:34,030 --> 00:58:35,875
You are an employee at the wedding hall.

1314
00:58:36,500 --> 00:58:38,328
- That's right. - I have seen such employees.

1315
00:58:38,329 --> 00:58:39,738
- Me too. - He shows people to their seats.

1316
00:58:39,739 --> 00:58:41,138
- An employee for the event. - Yes.

1317
00:58:41,139 --> 00:58:43,868
They are the guests at the wedding.

1318
00:58:43,869 --> 00:58:46,169
So Min is a guest...

1319
00:58:46,170 --> 00:58:48,154
who dressed up more than the bride.

1320
00:58:48,539 --> 00:58:50,509
She is here for the after-party.

1321
00:58:50,510 --> 00:58:52,609
I am determined to meet my future husband here.

1322
00:58:52,610 --> 00:58:55,424
That's right. You dressed up excessively.

1323
00:58:55,750 --> 00:58:57,348
By the way, the hints are too difficult.

1324
00:58:57,349 --> 00:58:58,718
Yes, they are. They are like riddles.

1325
00:58:58,719 --> 00:59:00,518
- There is a spy. Did you hear? - Yes.

1326
00:59:00,519 --> 00:59:01,859
- Who is the spy? - Isn't it you?

1327
00:59:01,860 --> 00:59:03,765
Which member is working the hardest?

1328
00:59:03,829 --> 00:59:05,058
That member is the spy.

1329
00:59:05,059 --> 00:59:06,158
Seok Jin didn't work hard, did he?

1330
00:59:06,159 --> 00:59:08,229
He keeps rapping by himself.

1331
00:59:08,230 --> 00:59:10,705
This is hard. All of us are working hard.

1332
00:59:10,829 --> 00:59:12,868
Apink thinks the member...

1333
00:59:12,869 --> 00:59:14,968
who is working the hardest is Haha.

1334
00:59:14,969 --> 00:59:16,169
- I see. - My goodness.

1335
00:59:16,170 --> 00:59:18,908
- They think Haha could be the spy. - I am not the spy.

1336
00:59:18,909 --> 00:59:20,939
- I am 100 percent sure. - I was the spy...

1337
00:59:20,940 --> 00:59:22,314
for the last two weeks. I am not the spy.

1338
00:59:22,539 --> 00:59:25,509
It must be someone who suits a circle.

1339
00:59:25,510 --> 00:59:27,779
Maybe "Balls" represent the Korean letter, ieung.

1340
00:59:27,780 --> 00:59:30,189
Then the spy's name would have ieung,

1341
00:59:30,190 --> 00:59:32,049
but not mieum.

1342
00:59:32,050 --> 00:59:33,859
Ieung looks like a circle and mieum looks like a square.

1343
00:59:33,860 --> 00:59:34,959
(Do "Balls" represent ieung and "Dice" represent mieum?)

1344
00:59:34,960 --> 00:59:37,388
- I think you are right! - Everyone's name has ieung...

1345
00:59:37,389 --> 00:59:38,689
- except for yours. - My name doesn't have it.

1346
00:59:38,690 --> 00:59:40,058
- My name doesn't have it. - You are the only one.

1347
00:59:40,059 --> 00:59:41,328
Jee Seok Jin doesn't have ieung.

1348
00:59:41,329 --> 00:59:42,328
Everyone else's name has it.

1349
00:59:42,329 --> 00:59:44,575
- Everyone else's name has it. - How about So Min?

1350
00:59:44,670 --> 00:59:47,069
- Haha. - Jong Kook's name has it.

1351
00:59:47,070 --> 00:59:48,138
(Is the hint about the spy's name?)

1352
00:59:48,139 --> 00:59:50,138
- We are ITZY. - ITZY.

1353
00:59:50,139 --> 00:59:51,814
- Thank you. - Thank you.

1354
00:59:52,170 --> 00:59:54,779
(Part 1 came to an end!)

1355
00:59:54,780 --> 00:59:56,848
- Let's go! - Apink!

1356
00:59:56,849 --> 00:59:58,308
- Apink, let's go! - You can do it!

1357
00:59:58,309 --> 00:59:59,785
Apink, let's go!

1358
01:00:00,179 --> 01:00:01,348
- Kwang Soo. - Good luck.

1359
01:00:01,349 --> 01:00:03,364
- Good luck. - Do a good job.

1360
01:00:04,519 --> 01:00:05,919
(The joint performances...)

1361
01:00:05,920 --> 01:00:07,165
(with Apink, Nucksal, Code Kunst, SORAN, and Gummy.)

1362
01:00:07,659 --> 01:00:10,629
(What kind of joint performances will we see?)

1363
01:00:10,630 --> 01:00:11,629
(Pink Nose Light, Hyo Chan Park,)

1364
01:00:11,630 --> 01:00:12,734
(Jeon SORAN and Yu Jae Seok, and F-Killer)

1365
01:00:13,329 --> 01:00:14,698
It will be fun.

1366
01:00:14,699 --> 01:00:16,328
Please standby.

1367
01:00:16,329 --> 01:00:18,529
I think I will forget the dance.

1368
01:00:18,530 --> 01:00:20,245
- Don't do that. - I am so nervous.

1369
01:00:20,670 --> 01:00:21,975
This is driving me crazy.

1370
01:00:22,239 --> 01:00:24,939
Why are you nervous? Do you get nervous when you act?

1371
01:00:24,940 --> 01:00:27,509
I haven't performed on a stage.

1372
01:00:27,510 --> 01:00:30,049
I feel like it will be over if I make a mistake.

1373
01:00:30,050 --> 01:00:31,308
(The pressure comes from knowing he only has one chance.)

1374
01:00:31,309 --> 01:00:32,754
How fascinating!

1375
01:00:33,150 --> 01:00:35,154
To be honest, I could puke right now.

1376
01:00:35,250 --> 01:00:36,665
I am serious.

1377
01:00:36,989 --> 01:00:38,265
I am holding it back.

1378
01:00:39,619 --> 01:00:42,435
(Seok Jin and Kwang Soo are on standby on the stage.)

1379
01:00:42,659 --> 01:00:44,364
(Screaming)

1380
01:00:45,030 --> 01:00:46,029
There they are.

1381
01:00:46,030 --> 01:00:47,029
(Other artists watch with anticipation.)

1382
01:00:47,030 --> 01:00:48,134
It's Apink!

1383
01:00:48,699 --> 01:00:51,328
Will I be able to wear that kind of pink before I die?

1384
01:00:51,329 --> 01:00:52,368
There they are.

1385
01:00:52,369 --> 01:00:55,169
(These men are wearing pink outfits, which is Code Kunst's dream.)

1386
01:00:55,170 --> 01:00:57,439
(Their hearts are about to burst.)

1387
01:00:57,440 --> 01:00:59,908
(Apink watches them worriedly.)

1388
01:00:59,909 --> 01:01:02,138
(What kind of performance did they prepare?)

1389
01:01:02,139 --> 01:01:03,979
(Apink)

1390
01:01:03,980 --> 01:01:05,448
(Jee Seok Jin)

1391
01:01:05,449 --> 01:01:07,149
(Lee Kwang Soo)

1392
01:01:07,150 --> 01:01:11,794
(Pink Nose Light)

1393
01:01:12,150 --> 01:01:13,689
- Hello. - Hello.

1394
01:01:13,690 --> 01:01:15,359
- Hello. - Hello.

1395
01:01:15,360 --> 01:01:16,888
This is the kind of song we would never have received.

1396
01:01:16,889 --> 01:01:18,928
Are you satisfied with the song?

1397
01:01:18,929 --> 01:01:20,399
Do you think it's good?

1398
01:01:20,400 --> 01:01:22,799
- I did my best. - Right? It's really nice.

1399
01:01:22,800 --> 01:01:25,299
- I hope we can pull this off. - I know.

1400
01:01:25,300 --> 01:01:26,868
You might become disappointed today.

1401
01:01:26,869 --> 01:01:29,038
- We'll do out best. - You might become disappointed.

1402
01:01:29,039 --> 01:01:30,908
Nang only gives compliments.

1403
01:01:30,909 --> 01:01:33,038
- Really? - He does that even if you are bad.

1404
01:01:33,039 --> 01:01:34,408
- Really? - Yes.

1405
01:01:34,409 --> 01:01:36,439
I have low expectations.

1406
01:01:36,440 --> 01:01:38,408
I take what I can in a short amount of time.

1407
01:01:38,409 --> 01:01:39,749
Nang.

1408
01:01:39,750 --> 01:01:41,678
Did you compliment us in the past to take what you could?

1409
01:01:41,679 --> 01:01:43,348
I didn't mean that.

1410
01:01:43,349 --> 01:01:45,348
I complimented you in the past because you did a good job.

1411
01:01:45,349 --> 01:01:48,618
- I am glad we met a good man. - Seriously.

1412
01:01:48,619 --> 01:01:50,229
I want to ask you...

1413
01:01:50,230 --> 01:01:51,805
not to give up on us.

1414
01:01:51,929 --> 01:01:53,529
I will make it work.

1415
01:01:53,530 --> 01:01:54,928
If the notes become mushy...

1416
01:01:54,929 --> 01:01:55,928
"Mushy"?

1417
01:01:55,929 --> 01:01:58,129
(His tongue gets twisted already.)

1418
01:01:58,130 --> 01:01:59,968
(You'll tune our recording with the computer, right?)

1419
01:01:59,969 --> 01:02:01,538
He is the repair shop of the music industry.

1420
01:02:01,539 --> 01:02:03,408
(Don't worry because Nang is a veteran composer.)

1421
01:02:03,409 --> 01:02:05,038
- Should we decide on a team name? - That's right.

1422
01:02:05,039 --> 01:02:06,808
- The others already made theirs. - That's right.

1423
01:02:06,809 --> 01:02:08,078
What should we use?

1424
01:02:08,079 --> 01:02:10,024
Since our last names are Lee and Jee,

1425
01:02:10,050 --> 01:02:11,609
we go by LeeJee Brothers.

1426
01:02:11,610 --> 01:02:13,109
Then we could be Pink LeeJee.

1427
01:02:13,110 --> 01:02:14,578
(Then we could be Pink LeeJee.)

1428
01:02:14,579 --> 01:02:15,995
- Pink LeeJee. - Pink LeeJee.

1429
01:02:16,650 --> 01:02:17,718
It's cute.

1430
01:02:17,719 --> 01:02:18,788
Pink Nosebleed.

1431
01:02:18,789 --> 01:02:19,959
- Pink Nosebleed? - Pink Nosebleed?

1432
01:02:19,960 --> 01:02:20,988
- Why? - We want people to get nosebleeds.

1433
01:02:20,989 --> 01:02:22,658
You are "Pink", he is "Nose", and I am "Bleed"?

1434
01:02:22,659 --> 01:02:23,935
You don't want that name.

1435
01:02:24,329 --> 01:02:25,558
(If not Pink LeeJee or Pink Nosebleed...)

1436
01:02:25,559 --> 01:02:27,328
I think Pink Nose Light would be good.

1437
01:02:27,329 --> 01:02:28,928
- Pink Nose Light. - Pink Nose Light.

1438
01:02:28,929 --> 01:02:30,245
- "Kwang" means "Light". - Pink Nose Light.

1439
01:02:30,670 --> 01:02:32,569
- Pink Nose Light. - It's a good one.

1440
01:02:32,570 --> 01:02:34,645
- Pink Nose Light is cute. - It's a good one.

1441
01:02:34,699 --> 01:02:36,908
- We are Pink Nose Light. - Pink Nose Light.

1442
01:02:36,909 --> 01:02:38,368
(They decided on Pink Nose Light.)

1443
01:02:38,369 --> 01:02:40,439
- Shall we listen to the song? - Yes.

1444
01:02:40,440 --> 01:02:41,515
(It's time to listen to the song.)

1445
01:02:42,780 --> 01:02:45,825
(We gonna party, I like that.)

1446
01:02:46,349 --> 01:02:47,819
(We gonna party.)

1447
01:02:47,820 --> 01:02:49,319
(I like that.)

1448
01:02:49,320 --> 01:02:50,488
It suits him.

1449
01:02:50,489 --> 01:02:52,395
(He is pretty good.)

1450
01:02:52,690 --> 01:02:53,919
It sounds like he is singing the guide track.

1451
01:02:53,920 --> 01:02:55,194
(Seok Jin's throat is in good condition.)

1452
01:02:55,889 --> 01:02:57,988
(Good cheer)

1453
01:02:57,989 --> 01:02:59,705
Nang, let's record the song now.

1454
01:03:01,500 --> 01:03:05,245
(Humming)

1455
01:03:06,130 --> 01:03:07,645
The bridge.

1456
01:03:07,670 --> 01:03:09,114
It's your part.

1457
01:03:09,800 --> 01:03:11,544
(Gather around! Right now!)

1458
01:03:13,170 --> 01:03:15,678
(Gather around! Right now!)

1459
01:03:15,679 --> 01:03:17,649
(That's incredible.)

1460
01:03:17,650 --> 01:03:19,424
(Yeah!)

1461
01:03:20,280 --> 01:03:22,218
(Seok Jin and Kwang Soo are good.)

1462
01:03:22,219 --> 01:03:23,279
That part was funny.

1463
01:03:23,280 --> 01:03:24,864
(The enthusiastic response gives them confidence.)

1464
01:03:25,719 --> 01:03:27,464
- The song is really nice. - I know.

1465
01:03:27,489 --> 01:03:29,594
It's refreshing.

1466
01:03:29,860 --> 01:03:33,035
- You are good. - Until the sun rises

1467
01:03:33,159 --> 01:03:36,058
- Eun Ji, warm up your throat first. - Okay.

1468
01:03:36,059 --> 01:03:37,399
She will warm up her throat.

1469
01:03:37,400 --> 01:03:39,145
(The main vocalist of Apink, Eun Ji warms up her throat.)

1470
01:03:39,800 --> 01:03:41,939
(When the sun sets.)

1471
01:03:41,940 --> 01:03:44,145
(When the stars rise.)

1472
01:03:45,809 --> 01:03:48,078
(Baby, baby, right here.)

1473
01:03:48,079 --> 01:03:49,955
(Impressed)

1474
01:03:50,579 --> 01:03:52,408
- My goodness. - Her voice suits the song.

1475
01:03:52,409 --> 01:03:54,455
- Her voice suits the song. - Gosh, it's so nice.

1476
01:03:54,920 --> 01:03:57,448
- He always does that. - That's right.

1477
01:03:57,449 --> 01:03:58,718
- That's his style. - Nang.

1478
01:03:58,719 --> 01:04:00,419
(Nang's compliment makes Eun Ji embarrassed.)

1479
01:04:00,420 --> 01:04:02,794
- It was okay, right? - It was really nice.

1480
01:04:04,230 --> 01:04:06,388
(Baby, baby, right here)

1481
01:04:06,389 --> 01:04:08,835
- That's good. We are set. - Are we set?

1482
01:04:09,230 --> 01:04:10,475
That's good.

1483
01:04:10,829 --> 01:04:14,814
(Eun Ji's recording goes without a hitch.)

1484
01:04:15,070 --> 01:04:16,238
- It's nice. - Okay.

1485
01:04:16,239 --> 01:04:17,709
It's nice, but...

1486
01:04:17,710 --> 01:04:19,444
He says "It's nice" first.

1487
01:04:19,510 --> 01:04:20,678
That's how he starts off.

1488
01:04:20,679 --> 01:04:22,614
It seemed like he was angry.

1489
01:04:22,710 --> 01:04:24,348
"It's nice, but..."

1490
01:04:24,349 --> 01:04:25,578
(There are many emotions within "It's nice.")

1491
01:04:25,579 --> 01:04:26,609
It's not like that.

1492
01:04:26,610 --> 01:04:27,678
Good!

1493
01:04:27,679 --> 01:04:28,794
(It means he really likes it.)

1494
01:04:29,050 --> 01:04:30,249
Gosh, it's nice.

1495
01:04:30,250 --> 01:04:31,794
(It means he likes it so much that he is going crazy.)

1496
01:04:32,019 --> 01:04:33,734
- Nang. - That's his style.

1497
01:04:34,559 --> 01:04:36,089
I am gaining confidence.

1498
01:04:36,090 --> 01:04:37,158
I know.

1499
01:04:37,159 --> 01:04:38,864
- Seeing Nang gives me confidence. - I know.

1500
01:04:39,329 --> 01:04:40,859
- Kwang Soo. - Yes?

1501
01:04:40,860 --> 01:04:42,274
I feel nervous in here.

1502
01:04:42,360 --> 01:04:44,268
- Please sing comfortably. - Good luck.

1503
01:04:44,269 --> 01:04:45,504
All right.

1504
01:04:45,530 --> 01:04:46,875
It's Seok Jin's turn.

1505
01:04:47,099 --> 01:04:48,198
I can't wait.

1506
01:04:48,199 --> 01:04:49,439
(He pulled off the intro perfectly a moment ago.)

1507
01:04:49,440 --> 01:04:51,939
(We gonna party.)

1508
01:04:51,940 --> 01:04:53,044
(That...)

1509
01:04:53,170 --> 01:04:55,839
(We gonna party.)

1510
01:04:55,840 --> 01:04:57,149
(He missed the beat.)

1511
01:04:57,150 --> 01:04:58,355
My goodness.

1512
01:04:58,550 --> 01:04:59,725
Let's start over.

1513
01:04:59,949 --> 01:05:01,149
My goodness.

1514
01:05:01,150 --> 01:05:02,424
(They burst out laughing.)

1515
01:05:02,519 --> 01:05:03,825
It's nice. It's nice.

1516
01:05:03,849 --> 01:05:04,964
It's very nice.

1517
01:05:04,989 --> 01:05:06,964
He will lose his confidence.

1518
01:05:07,190 --> 01:05:08,564
- It's nice. - When that happens,

1519
01:05:08,619 --> 01:05:10,634
his back becomes hunched.

1520
01:05:10,659 --> 01:05:11,828
He will soon sing like this.

1521
01:05:11,829 --> 01:05:13,265
(He did a good job earlier.)

1522
01:05:13,699 --> 01:05:15,035
I am nervous.

1523
01:05:15,559 --> 01:05:17,504
- Good luck. - Please sing comfortably.

1524
01:05:17,829 --> 01:05:20,274
(With Apink's support, his 2nd attempt begins.)

1525
01:05:21,369 --> 01:05:24,585
(I like that.)

1526
01:05:27,510 --> 01:05:28,709
I am less nervous now.

1527
01:05:28,710 --> 01:05:30,384
(He suddenly becomes arrogant.)

1528
01:05:30,710 --> 01:05:34,024
Your vocalization became freer.

1529
01:05:34,420 --> 01:05:36,725
(How about this?)

1530
01:05:36,989 --> 01:05:40,024
(That's incredible!)

1531
01:05:40,889 --> 01:05:42,535
That's incredible.

1532
01:05:43,320 --> 01:05:44,388
Thank you.

1533
01:05:44,389 --> 01:05:45,488
I don't know if we are complimenting him...

1534
01:05:45,489 --> 01:05:46,705
or making fun of him.

1535
01:05:46,800 --> 01:05:48,975
- Are we complimenting him? - Yes.

1536
01:05:49,360 --> 01:05:51,975
- Let's warm up your throat first. - Okay.

1537
01:05:57,610 --> 01:06:00,839
(Until today becomes tomorrow morning)

1538
01:06:00,840 --> 01:06:02,085
(My goodness!)

1539
01:06:02,280 --> 01:06:04,279
(They cheer loudly.)

1540
01:06:04,280 --> 01:06:06,049
- It wasn't half bad. - Bravo.

1541
01:06:06,050 --> 01:06:07,819
He is happy. He is happy.

1542
01:06:07,820 --> 01:06:08,924
(Look at Kwang Soo.)

1543
01:06:08,980 --> 01:06:10,194
He is happy.

1544
01:06:10,590 --> 01:06:11,765
Stop it!

1545
01:06:13,190 --> 01:06:14,218
Let's stop it.

1546
01:06:14,219 --> 01:06:15,564
If we tease him too much, he will catch on.

1547
01:06:16,559 --> 01:06:17,689
It's nice.

1548
01:06:17,690 --> 01:06:19,064
- It's nice, right? - Yes.

1549
01:06:19,929 --> 01:06:22,629
(Pink Nose Light sings "Party" together.)

1550
01:06:22,630 --> 01:06:25,529
(The song that will welcome the refreshing breeze of fall...)

1551
01:06:25,530 --> 01:06:27,774
(will be revealed soon.)

1552
01:06:28,300 --> 01:06:30,808
(Pink Nose Light practices dance 3 weeks before the fan-meet.)

1553
01:06:30,809 --> 01:06:32,785
(Jo Ah Ra, Choreographer of "Party")

1554
01:06:33,139 --> 01:06:34,209
(A dance battle between Kwang Soo and Seok Jin...)

1555
01:06:34,210 --> 01:06:35,209
(is a key point of the dance routine.)

1556
01:06:35,210 --> 01:06:37,078
(Na Eun, Eun Ji, Bo Mi, and Kwang Soo...)

1557
01:06:37,079 --> 01:06:38,984
(versus Ha Young, Nam Joo, Cho Rong, and Seok Jin)

1558
01:06:40,150 --> 01:06:42,424
(When the two of them have a fight,)

1559
01:06:42,719 --> 01:06:44,848
(Bo Mi does a silly dance...)

1560
01:06:44,849 --> 01:06:47,035
(and wraps up the situation.)

1561
01:06:47,489 --> 01:06:49,594
Here is the important thing.

1562
01:06:49,789 --> 01:06:51,035
You shouldn't dance to the beat.

1563
01:06:51,130 --> 01:06:53,359
Don't dance to the beat.

1564
01:06:53,360 --> 01:06:54,859
Dance however you want.

1565
01:06:54,860 --> 01:06:57,004
It will be better that way.

1566
01:06:57,699 --> 01:06:59,198
(Bo Mi's offbeat and silly dance begins.)

1567
01:06:59,199 --> 01:07:00,774
(Laughing)

1568
01:07:02,269 --> 01:07:04,785
(How about this dance?)

1569
01:07:07,280 --> 01:07:08,538
(The vending machine of silly dances...)

1570
01:07:08,539 --> 01:07:09,884
(begins to work.)

1571
01:07:13,719 --> 01:07:16,154
(Bo Mi showed a new dance at every practice.)

1572
01:07:17,019 --> 01:07:20,294
(Which dance will she show on stage?)

1573
01:07:21,789 --> 01:07:22,859
Shall we begin?

1574
01:07:22,860 --> 01:07:24,305
Pink Nose Light, good luck. Let's go.

1575
01:07:24,329 --> 01:07:26,265
Kwang Soo.

1576
01:07:26,860 --> 01:07:29,029
When you sing "This honest feeling",

1577
01:07:29,030 --> 01:07:31,768
- you move to the back. - Yes.

1578
01:07:31,769 --> 01:07:33,999
The camera will zoom in on you then,

1579
01:07:34,000 --> 01:07:36,114
- so please look to the front. - Okay.

1580
01:07:36,400 --> 01:07:37,968
Music, start.

1581
01:07:37,969 --> 01:07:39,544
(The rehearsal that serves as the final practice begins.)

1582
01:07:43,949 --> 01:07:46,379
(They do relatively well until Kwang Soo's solo part.)

1583
01:07:46,380 --> 01:07:50,254
(He just needs to fall back as he looks to the front.)

1584
01:07:56,789 --> 01:07:59,435
(He bumps into Bo Mi.)

1585
01:07:59,789 --> 01:08:02,274
(He lifts up Bo Mi to hide his embarrassment.)

1586
01:08:03,329 --> 01:08:05,305
(This is a disaster.)

1587
01:08:05,929 --> 01:08:07,669
(The final practice ends that way.)

1588
01:08:07,670 --> 01:08:09,169
- Good work, everyone. - Are you okay?

1589
01:08:09,170 --> 01:08:10,169
(You fell down.)

1590
01:08:10,170 --> 01:08:12,968
(The last rehearsal ended on a shaky note.)

1591
01:08:12,969 --> 01:08:15,109
(In that nervousness,)

1592
01:08:15,110 --> 01:08:18,955
(these two men prepare for the performance.)

1593
01:08:19,949 --> 01:08:23,765
("Party" by Pink Nose Light)

1594
01:08:29,760 --> 01:08:31,689
(The refreshing intro improves...)

1595
01:08:31,690 --> 01:08:33,705
(the two men's musical-like performance.)

1596
01:08:34,230 --> 01:08:35,528
They are so cool.

1597
01:08:35,529 --> 01:08:36,599
They are so cool.

1598
01:08:36,600 --> 01:08:38,429
It's like a youthful drama.

1599
01:08:38,430 --> 01:08:40,745
- "Tree Blooming with Love". - "Grease".

1600
01:08:42,000 --> 01:08:44,514
(The female leads of the youthful drama enter.)

1601
01:08:59,319 --> 01:09:00,559
I need to stand up.

1602
01:09:00,560 --> 01:09:01,889
- I can't see very well. - Me neither.

1603
01:09:01,890 --> 01:09:03,694
(The two uncle fans watch reverently.)

1604
01:09:09,399 --> 01:09:12,304
(Na Eun's performance heats up the atmosphere.)

1605
01:09:12,930 --> 01:09:15,715
(It's Seok Jin's solo part.)

1606
01:09:16,100 --> 01:09:17,938
(Seok Jin will forget about his age today.)

1607
01:09:17,939 --> 01:09:19,238
For Seok Jin,

1608
01:09:19,239 --> 01:09:21,255
this is like "Dad's Challenge".

1609
01:09:21,640 --> 01:09:23,885
(My son, are you watching?)

1610
01:09:31,050 --> 01:09:33,589
(Gather around! Right now!)

1611
01:09:33,590 --> 01:09:34,919
(They burst out laughing.)

1612
01:09:34,920 --> 01:09:36,194
What was this?

1613
01:09:36,319 --> 01:09:37,705
(He is proud.)

1614
01:09:56,939 --> 01:09:59,054
(She keeps her eyes on the camera.)

1615
01:09:59,449 --> 01:10:01,795
She is so relaxed.

1616
01:10:01,819 --> 01:10:03,965
How does she look at the camera with such ease?

1617
01:10:15,960 --> 01:10:18,444
(It's time for Kwang Soo's problematic part.)

1618
01:10:18,670 --> 01:10:21,169
(Will he take a risk for a closeup shot...)

1619
01:10:21,170 --> 01:10:24,045
(or stick to safety even if it's cowardly?)

1620
01:10:25,840 --> 01:10:27,778
(He looks at the back.)

1621
01:10:27,779 --> 01:10:30,255
(He took the cowardly route and looked at the back.)

1622
01:10:31,579 --> 01:10:34,019
(The sun goes to the sea.)

1623
01:10:34,020 --> 01:10:35,825
(The stars go to the sky.)

1624
01:10:36,579 --> 01:10:38,795
(Bo Mi flies.)

1625
01:10:39,850 --> 01:10:41,835
(Kwang Soo lifts her up as powerfully as he can.)

1626
01:10:42,060 --> 01:10:44,604
(Bo Mi's jump excites the audience.)

1627
01:11:09,550 --> 01:11:11,694
(It's for Kwang Soo and Seok Jin to get sexy.)

1628
01:11:14,859 --> 01:11:16,759
(Dancing)

1629
01:11:16,760 --> 01:11:18,734
(Men cheer even louder.)

1630
01:11:18,989 --> 01:11:21,658
(It's time for the climax, the dance battle.)

1631
01:11:21,659 --> 01:11:24,175
(Check out my Mosquito Dance!)

1632
01:11:27,199 --> 01:11:28,774
(Stop it!)

1633
01:11:34,439 --> 01:11:36,785
(She is the queen.)

1634
01:11:39,479 --> 01:11:41,519
(Bo Mi's silly dance wraps up the situation.)

1635
01:11:41,520 --> 01:11:43,278
- Oh, Bo Mi. - She is cute.

1636
01:11:43,279 --> 01:11:44,589
Bo Mi.

1637
01:11:44,590 --> 01:11:46,165
(She is so cute.)

1638
01:11:46,289 --> 01:11:48,295
(Bo Mi.)

1639
01:11:49,319 --> 01:11:52,835
(We gonna party, I like that.)

1640
01:11:56,029 --> 01:11:58,769
(Put everything down and party.)

1641
01:11:58,770 --> 01:12:00,999
(I like that.)

1642
01:12:01,000 --> 01:12:04,385
(Thanks to Apink's lead, they look like a cute coed group.)

1643
01:12:09,979 --> 01:12:11,778
They're cute.

1644
01:12:11,779 --> 01:12:13,278
(They clap along with the bubbly and cute song.)

1645
01:12:13,279 --> 01:12:14,425
Kwang Soo.

1646
01:12:16,579 --> 01:12:19,519
(This is the 1st collaboration performance of the night,)

1647
01:12:19,520 --> 01:12:23,234
(so Pink Nose Light members practiced hard for 3 months.)

1648
01:12:26,659 --> 01:12:29,375
(That was Pink Nose Light.)

1649
01:12:31,069 --> 01:12:33,974
(That was a perfect performance to start Part Two of the fan-meet.)

1650
01:12:35,000 --> 01:12:37,885
(The audience loves it.)

1651
01:12:38,470 --> 01:12:40,385
Thank you.

1652
01:12:40,710 --> 01:12:42,679
- We should have gone first. - Let's go.

1653
01:12:42,680 --> 01:12:44,184
They were so good.

1654
01:12:45,149 --> 01:12:46,684
Thank you very much.

1655
01:12:47,979 --> 01:12:49,795
- Are you all right, Kwang Soo? - I am.

1656
01:12:50,550 --> 01:12:52,625
- Are you okay? - I'm okay.

1657
01:12:52,819 --> 01:12:54,864
Please give him a round of applause.

1658
01:12:55,090 --> 01:12:56,394
Thank you.

1659
01:12:57,460 --> 01:12:58,858
(His parents are proud.)

1660
01:12:58,859 --> 01:13:01,259
We practiced so much, but I made a mistake.

1661
01:13:01,260 --> 01:13:02,528
I was so nervous.

1662
01:13:02,529 --> 01:13:03,728
I was supposed to do this,

1663
01:13:03,729 --> 01:13:04,769
but I did this.

1664
01:13:04,770 --> 01:13:05,898
(He did a hula dance.)

1665
01:13:05,899 --> 01:13:07,099
This dance...

1666
01:13:07,100 --> 01:13:08,845
Everybody, we are...

1667
01:13:08,899 --> 01:13:12,868
- Pink - Nose Light

1668
01:13:12,869 --> 01:13:13,908
Excuse us.

1669
01:13:13,909 --> 01:13:14,984
(He gives up fast.)

1670
01:13:15,210 --> 01:13:17,984
(Pink Nose Light is better at performing than singing.)

1671
01:13:18,710 --> 01:13:20,349
(It's all right.)

1672
01:13:20,350 --> 01:13:24,064
We tried our best not to hurt Apink's reputation.

1673
01:13:24,090 --> 01:13:26,194
I don't know if we did okay.

1674
01:13:26,220 --> 01:13:27,419
I'm worried.

1675
01:13:27,420 --> 01:13:28,519
How were the past three months?

1676
01:13:28,520 --> 01:13:31,228
I was the oldest in this group...

1677
01:13:31,229 --> 01:13:33,389
for the past eight years,

1678
01:13:33,390 --> 01:13:35,499
but I got rid of that title for the first time...

1679
01:13:35,500 --> 01:13:38,068
in eight years,

1680
01:13:38,069 --> 01:13:40,499
- so I was very happy. - It's difficult...

1681
01:13:40,500 --> 01:13:41,568
- to have somebody this old. - Right.

1682
01:13:41,569 --> 01:13:42,644
- Right? - Yes.

1683
01:13:42,840 --> 01:13:44,169
When I found out...

1684
01:13:44,170 --> 01:13:45,738
that we were on the same team,

1685
01:13:45,739 --> 01:13:50,009
I was ready to dance with Seok Jin on my back.

1686
01:13:50,010 --> 01:13:51,309
Because of me,

1687
01:13:51,310 --> 01:13:53,879
you were far from the oldest.

1688
01:13:53,880 --> 01:13:54,879
- You were far from it. - Thank you.

1689
01:13:54,880 --> 01:13:55,978
Thank you very much.

1690
01:13:55,979 --> 01:13:57,549
Let's introduce the next team.

1691
01:13:57,550 --> 01:13:59,988
I heard Se Chan is into hip hop now.

1692
01:13:59,989 --> 01:14:01,264
- Hip hop? - Yes.

1693
01:14:01,420 --> 01:14:04,465
(MC Se Chan is ready.)

1694
01:14:06,659 --> 01:14:07,959
The next collaboration team is...

1695
01:14:07,960 --> 01:14:12,129
Ji Hyo, Se Chan, Nucksal,

1696
01:14:12,130 --> 01:14:13,828
(Ji Hyo, Se Chan, Nucksal...)

1697
01:14:13,829 --> 01:14:15,014
and...

1698
01:14:15,069 --> 01:14:17,245
Code Kunst.

1699
01:14:17,970 --> 01:14:20,444
I heard that...

1700
01:14:20,510 --> 01:14:22,738
somebody incredible is coming.

1701
01:14:22,739 --> 01:14:24,209
There's a hidden card.

1702
01:14:24,210 --> 01:14:25,278
There's a hidden card again?

1703
01:14:25,279 --> 01:14:27,224
You can look forward to it.

1704
01:14:27,979 --> 01:14:29,194
Everybody,

1705
01:14:29,880 --> 01:14:32,148
are you ready to have fun?

1706
01:14:32,149 --> 01:14:34,089
- Yes! - Yes!

1707
01:14:34,090 --> 01:14:35,988
Make some noise!

1708
01:14:35,989 --> 01:14:38,335
(Seok Jin emcees the old way.)

1709
01:14:38,789 --> 01:14:42,129
That concludes Pink Nose Light's performance.

1710
01:14:42,130 --> 01:14:43,604
- Cho Rong, do you want to end? - Okay.

1711
01:14:43,699 --> 01:14:45,198
Let's say goodbye.

1712
01:14:45,199 --> 01:14:46,398
That was...

1713
01:14:46,399 --> 01:14:51,339
- Pink - Nose Light

1714
01:14:51,340 --> 01:14:54,309
- Thank you. - Thank you.

1715
01:14:54,310 --> 01:14:55,614
Thank you.

1716
01:14:56,510 --> 01:14:58,554
There's so much excitement out there.

1717
01:14:59,210 --> 01:15:00,478
This is no joke.

1718
01:15:00,479 --> 01:15:03,394
- Great work, everybody. - Great work.

1719
01:15:03,420 --> 01:15:04,825
Are you all right?

1720
01:15:05,020 --> 01:15:06,965
Did you vomit on stage?

1721
01:15:06,989 --> 01:15:08,295
Drink some water.

1722
01:15:08,489 --> 01:15:10,519
Everybody, let's check the hint.

1723
01:15:10,520 --> 01:15:12,688
(It's time to check the decibels to earn the hint on the spy.)

1724
01:15:12,689 --> 01:15:16,175
(What were their highest decibels?)

1725
01:15:16,300 --> 01:15:18,528
The cheer from the audience reached 126dB.

1726
01:15:18,529 --> 01:15:19,799
The cheer from the audience...

1727
01:15:19,800 --> 01:15:20,868
reached 126dB.

1728
01:15:20,869 --> 01:15:22,774
- so you've earned the hint. - Okay.

1729
01:15:23,000 --> 01:15:25,014
(The highest decibels came from this part.)

1730
01:15:25,539 --> 01:15:29,114
(Thanks to Bo Mi's dance, they scored 126.8dB.)

1731
01:15:29,810 --> 01:15:31,854
- Okay. - Please choose 1 out of 3.

1732
01:15:32,409 --> 01:15:34,818
This is the hint. It's a hint about the spy.

1733
01:15:34,819 --> 01:15:38,064
(The spy buys coffee sometimes.)

1734
01:15:38,189 --> 01:15:39,249
What's this?

1735
01:15:39,250 --> 01:15:40,318
(The spy buys coffee sometimes.)

1736
01:15:40,319 --> 01:15:41,495
- What is it? - Let me see.

1737
01:15:43,090 --> 01:15:45,288
- They buy coffee. - Does anybody own a coffee shop?

1738
01:15:45,289 --> 01:15:47,188
- No. - Great work.

1739
01:15:47,189 --> 01:15:48,604
- They buy coffee. - They do.

1740
01:15:48,630 --> 01:15:50,804
Did nobody pay for coffee?

1741
01:15:51,430 --> 01:15:53,304
I don't think we did.

1742
01:15:53,329 --> 01:15:54,614
Wait.

1743
01:15:54,640 --> 01:15:56,175
So Min paid for coffee today.

1744
01:15:56,300 --> 01:15:57,644
Did she?

1745
01:15:57,939 --> 01:15:59,839
- It was her first time paying. - Really?

1746
01:15:59,840 --> 01:16:01,184
(So Min paid for coffee today.)

1747
01:16:01,710 --> 01:16:04,148
(She usually don't get coffee.)

1748
01:16:04,149 --> 01:16:06,455
(Who is the spy?)

1749
01:16:07,079 --> 01:16:08,919
(This is the second collaboration performance.)

1750
01:16:08,920 --> 01:16:10,618
(Nucksal and Code Kunst appear,)

1751
01:16:10,619 --> 01:16:12,364
(and the audience's expectations rise.)

1752
01:16:12,550 --> 01:16:14,264
(They look relaxed.)

1753
01:16:14,890 --> 01:16:16,719
(They dominate the stage...)

1754
01:16:16,720 --> 01:16:19,165
(with their bright auras.)

1755
01:16:20,659 --> 01:16:21,934
Nucksal.

1756
01:16:22,100 --> 01:16:23,505
He looks cool.

1757
01:16:23,600 --> 01:16:25,045
He looks cool.

1758
01:16:25,729 --> 01:16:27,099
Are you ready to have fun?

1759
01:16:27,100 --> 01:16:28,845
(They're ready to have fun.)

1760
01:16:29,840 --> 01:16:33,245
(They're professionals who have been in competitions.)

1761
01:16:34,279 --> 01:16:37,309
(He's a rookie who is not relaxed at all.)

1762
01:16:37,310 --> 01:16:40,325
(They're really nervous.)

1763
01:16:42,180 --> 01:16:44,564
(The video plays before the performance.)

1764
01:16:45,390 --> 01:16:48,658
(How was this performance made?)

1765
01:16:48,659 --> 01:16:50,118
(Song Ji Hyo)

1766
01:16:50,119 --> 01:16:51,858
(Yang Se Chan)

1767
01:16:51,859 --> 01:16:56,299
(Hyo Chan Park)

1768
01:16:56,300 --> 01:16:59,469
- What are we going to do? - I think the important thing is...

1769
01:16:59,470 --> 01:17:01,398
to discuss the lyrics you and Ji Hyo wrote.

1770
01:17:01,399 --> 01:17:02,868
That's the most important part.

1771
01:17:02,869 --> 01:17:05,469
- We need a theme. - That's what we'll talk about.

1772
01:17:05,470 --> 01:17:07,009
Like you mentioned last time,

1773
01:17:07,010 --> 01:17:10,108
is this going to feel like a night club...

1774
01:17:10,109 --> 01:17:12,948
or something else? I wrote my lyrics to feel like that.

1775
01:17:12,949 --> 01:17:14,255
Let's hear it first.

1776
01:17:14,949 --> 01:17:16,024
- Here? - Yes.

1777
01:17:16,149 --> 01:17:17,988
- I'm so embarrassed. - Come on.

1778
01:17:17,989 --> 01:17:20,288
You can read to the beat.

1779
01:17:20,289 --> 01:17:22,059
This is a night club,

1780
01:17:22,060 --> 01:17:24,118
and everybody is having fun together.

1781
01:17:24,119 --> 01:17:25,129
You can read.

1782
01:17:25,130 --> 01:17:27,698
"Raise the volume and excitement".

1783
01:17:27,699 --> 01:17:30,358
"Soak your body with sweat".

1784
01:17:30,359 --> 01:17:33,099
"Those who are tired from studying, tired from looking for jobs",

1785
01:17:33,100 --> 01:17:35,644
"and those who are stressed and losing confidence".

1786
01:17:35,739 --> 01:17:37,908
"Spray the perfume, add the insoles",

1787
01:17:37,909 --> 01:17:40,238
"and use every penny you have to have fun. Let's go".

1788
01:17:40,239 --> 01:17:42,679
(and use every penny you have to have fun. Let's go.)

1789
01:17:42,680 --> 01:17:45,125
(It's fun to squander.)

1790
01:17:45,149 --> 01:17:47,578
- "Use every penny you have." - You have to.

1791
01:17:47,579 --> 01:17:48,978
- "Use every penny you have." - Let's go

1792
01:17:48,979 --> 01:17:50,419
- This is nice. - That's the feel.

1793
01:17:50,420 --> 01:17:53,419
"You don't know how to run, so you are suffocated".

1794
01:17:53,420 --> 01:17:55,559
"I'll provide the solution. I'm Baek Jong Won".

1795
01:17:55,560 --> 01:17:58,434
(I'll provide the solution. I'm Baek Jong Won.)

1796
01:17:58,960 --> 01:18:00,528
- "Baek Jong Won"? - That's the last part.

1797
01:18:00,529 --> 01:18:02,474
He rhymed it.

1798
01:18:03,000 --> 01:18:05,429
(This is MC Se Chan's newly discovered hip hop DNA.)

1799
01:18:05,430 --> 01:18:06,669
That's what I wrote.

1800
01:18:06,670 --> 01:18:08,368
- Then Ji Hyo. - Well,

1801
01:18:08,369 --> 01:18:09,938
mine's too dark.

1802
01:18:09,939 --> 01:18:11,269
That's good. That's better.

1803
01:18:11,270 --> 01:18:12,608
- That's better. - That is.

1804
01:18:12,609 --> 01:18:13,984
- Read it. - Please read it.

1805
01:18:14,109 --> 01:18:15,484
This is mine.

1806
01:18:16,140 --> 01:18:19,984
"When I started Running Man at 30, it was a hot day in July".

1807
01:18:20,380 --> 01:18:23,478
"I didn't know anything. I just ran, searched, and rolled".

1808
01:18:23,479 --> 01:18:26,595
"I am 39 now. It's a hot day in July again".

1809
01:18:27,050 --> 01:18:28,835
- "A grave"? - Hey.

1810
01:18:29,220 --> 01:18:30,959
(She said "hot" not "grave".)

1811
01:18:30,960 --> 01:18:33,688
Why would she go to a grave after nine years?

1812
01:18:33,689 --> 01:18:35,228
- Why would you do that to me? - Hot.

1813
01:18:35,229 --> 01:18:36,459
- You said it was dark. - Hot.

1814
01:18:36,460 --> 01:18:38,804
- That sounded scary. - I thought she said "grave'.

1815
01:18:39,430 --> 01:18:43,375
"I spent my 30s and one-third of my life on Running Man".

1816
01:18:43,539 --> 01:18:45,438
"Every moment and memory".

1817
01:18:45,439 --> 01:18:47,608
"Running Man is a part of everything".

1818
01:18:47,609 --> 01:18:48,984
That's nice.

1819
01:18:49,539 --> 01:18:52,654
"Kids go from kindergarten to high school".

1820
01:18:53,109 --> 01:18:55,179
"They smile and come say hi to me".

1821
01:18:55,180 --> 01:18:56,618
"I learn about myself".

1822
01:18:56,619 --> 01:18:57,788
"And I learn about you".

1823
01:18:57,789 --> 01:18:58,788
"And I learn about us".

1824
01:18:58,789 --> 01:19:00,894
"And we protect and lead each other".

1825
01:19:01,090 --> 01:19:03,219
You really like "and", Ji Hyo.

1826
01:19:03,220 --> 01:19:05,858
- You really do. - I didn't know how to end it.

1827
01:19:05,859 --> 01:19:07,358
- You don't have to. - It's nice.

1828
01:19:07,359 --> 01:19:09,205
That's why you have us.

1829
01:19:09,229 --> 01:19:11,345
They're writing something.

1830
01:19:11,430 --> 01:19:12,728
They wrote something. Are you done?

1831
01:19:12,729 --> 01:19:14,205
(Look at this.)

1832
01:19:14,569 --> 01:19:16,599
- Why? - What did he write?

1833
01:19:16,600 --> 01:19:18,309
- Did he write "grave"? - He said you failed.

1834
01:19:18,310 --> 01:19:19,509
We failed?

1835
01:19:19,510 --> 01:19:20,984
(Code Kunst said you failed.)

1836
01:19:22,310 --> 01:19:24,379
- At the end, - We failed.

1837
01:19:24,380 --> 01:19:25,854
I wrote, "We're in trouble".

1838
01:19:27,180 --> 01:19:28,219
Both of us.

1839
01:19:28,220 --> 01:19:29,325
(If this was an audition, they would have been eliminated.)

1840
01:19:29,720 --> 01:19:31,049
Okay.

1841
01:19:31,050 --> 01:19:32,194
What's our team name?

1842
01:19:32,750 --> 01:19:34,364
- The team name is important. - Right.

1843
01:19:34,420 --> 01:19:36,658
It's nice to combine our names.

1844
01:19:36,659 --> 01:19:38,059
I kind of wanted to do...

1845
01:19:38,060 --> 01:19:40,129
- Ji Hyo and Friends. - "Ji Hyo and Friends"?

1846
01:19:40,130 --> 01:19:42,459
No, we're not friends. We're much younger. What do you mean?

1847
01:19:42,460 --> 01:19:43,499
Ji Hyo and...

1848
01:19:43,500 --> 01:19:44,969
(Ms. 40 is mad.)

1849
01:19:44,970 --> 01:19:46,028
- You're not much younger. - Ji Hyo,

1850
01:19:46,029 --> 01:19:48,368
- the team name is important. - You're not much younger.

1851
01:19:48,369 --> 01:19:49,499
The team name is important.

1852
01:19:49,500 --> 01:19:50,738
You're the oldest.

1853
01:19:50,739 --> 01:19:52,345
- Hyo Chan. - I'm right.

1854
01:19:52,569 --> 01:19:54,245
- Ji Hyo and... - Hyo Chan Park.

1855
01:19:54,310 --> 01:19:55,879
- Hyo Chan. - Hyo Chan.

1856
01:19:55,880 --> 01:19:58,078
- Se Chan. - Hyo Chan Park.

1857
01:19:58,079 --> 01:20:00,009
- Hyo Chan Park? - That's good.

1858
01:20:00,010 --> 01:20:01,618
- One word each from their names? - Yes.

1859
01:20:01,619 --> 01:20:02,978
Are we a park?

1860
01:20:02,979 --> 01:20:04,179
- We are. - Yes, it's nice.

1861
01:20:04,180 --> 01:20:06,448
We let people play.

1862
01:20:06,449 --> 01:20:09,318
(We let people play.)

1863
01:20:09,319 --> 01:20:11,288
(Goodness)

1864
01:20:11,289 --> 01:20:13,259
(That's amazing.)

1865
01:20:13,260 --> 01:20:15,629
- That's awesome. I respect you! - I knew it.

1866
01:20:15,630 --> 01:20:17,434
(They respect Code Kunst.)

1867
01:20:17,729 --> 01:20:19,898
You are a park.

1868
01:20:19,899 --> 01:20:21,299
This is nice.

1869
01:20:21,300 --> 01:20:23,045
- Let's listen to it on the phone. - Okay.

1870
01:20:24,439 --> 01:20:25,809
(They listen to the melody of the song they'll be performing.)

1871
01:20:25,810 --> 01:20:27,238
So we'll take this song,

1872
01:20:27,239 --> 01:20:28,738
then you rap, I rap,

1873
01:20:28,739 --> 01:20:29,908
and she raps.

1874
01:20:29,909 --> 01:20:32,478
Do we just tell the story?

1875
01:20:32,479 --> 01:20:34,318
- I have a basic idea... - Are we going to work on that?

1876
01:20:34,319 --> 01:20:36,325
about the composition.

1877
01:20:37,050 --> 01:20:39,549
First of all, Ji Hyo...

1878
01:20:39,550 --> 01:20:40,818
(This is the first composition.)

1879
01:20:40,819 --> 01:20:42,118
will be the center.

1880
01:20:42,119 --> 01:20:44,019
- The center? - That's the chorus.

1881
01:20:44,020 --> 01:20:46,528
- You're moving her to the back. - No, I'm not.

1882
01:20:46,529 --> 01:20:48,299
(You're moving her to the back.)

1883
01:20:48,300 --> 01:20:49,728
You're unsure about letting her sing in the beginning,

1884
01:20:49,729 --> 01:20:51,429
- so you're moving her to the back. - She's not in the beginning.

1885
01:20:51,430 --> 01:20:53,999
I want to make her entrance impactful.

1886
01:20:54,000 --> 01:20:56,314
Are you saying that after you heard my lyrics?

1887
01:20:56,600 --> 01:20:59,684
- That's not what I meant. - Okay.

1888
01:20:59,810 --> 01:21:01,778
Being the center is even better.

1889
01:21:01,779 --> 01:21:04,078
That's the chorus part. The chorus is important.

1890
01:21:04,079 --> 01:21:05,379
Can she do it by herself?

1891
01:21:05,380 --> 01:21:07,054
So this is the second suggestion.

1892
01:21:07,079 --> 01:21:09,419
If I leave it up to Ji Hyo,

1893
01:21:09,420 --> 01:21:11,519
she might feel too pressured.

1894
01:21:11,520 --> 01:21:13,549
If you're not a vocalist,

1895
01:21:13,550 --> 01:21:14,889
- it's tough. - Right.

1896
01:21:14,890 --> 01:21:16,059
Can we give that part...

1897
01:21:16,060 --> 01:21:17,929
to somebody else?

1898
01:21:17,930 --> 01:21:20,104
- Somebody else? - Yes.

1899
01:21:20,159 --> 01:21:21,698
Like a vocalist?

1900
01:21:21,699 --> 01:21:22,959
So this is the idea.

1901
01:21:22,960 --> 01:21:24,104
In hip hop,

1902
01:21:24,199 --> 01:21:25,929
there's a featuring culture.

1903
01:21:25,930 --> 01:21:28,469
The songs can be diverse.

1904
01:21:28,470 --> 01:21:29,499
(For featuring,)

1905
01:21:29,500 --> 01:21:30,568
(how's that team?)

1906
01:21:30,569 --> 01:21:31,845
- Really? - What do you think?

1907
01:21:32,039 --> 01:21:34,514
(Can we ask them?)

1908
01:21:34,939 --> 01:21:38,684
(Who is them?)

1909
01:21:38,779 --> 01:21:40,908
- They're too huge. - The audience doesn't need us then.

1910
01:21:40,909 --> 01:21:42,995
(The audience doesn't need us then.)

1911
01:21:43,020 --> 01:21:47,788
It'll be more fun if they do it without us.

1912
01:21:47,789 --> 01:21:49,488
- It'll become a big party. - Is that right?

1913
01:21:49,489 --> 01:21:50,818
- That's not it. - They don't need us.

1914
01:21:50,819 --> 01:21:52,528
They won't come out in the beginning.

1915
01:21:52,529 --> 01:21:53,959
It'll be just us to start.

1916
01:21:53,960 --> 01:21:55,528
If the song is three minutes long,

1917
01:21:55,529 --> 01:21:58,099
we'll do 2 minutes and 30 seconds of it.

1918
01:21:58,100 --> 01:21:59,969
They just want us to be funny.

1919
01:21:59,970 --> 01:22:01,438
And that person will do the grand finale.

1920
01:22:01,439 --> 01:22:03,269
- You just want us to be funny. - That's not true.

1921
01:22:03,270 --> 01:22:04,868
- I'm so disappointed in you guys. - No.

1922
01:22:04,869 --> 01:22:07,038
- All of us will do it together. - All of us.

1923
01:22:07,039 --> 01:22:10,139
The appearance itself will improve the performance.

1924
01:22:10,140 --> 01:22:11,209
Right.

1925
01:22:11,210 --> 01:22:12,654
(Next week)

1926
01:22:13,210 --> 01:22:16,625
(A special guest joins the joint performance.)

1927
01:22:16,779 --> 01:22:19,448
(When Ji Hyo and Se Chan's performance is wild enough,)

1928
01:22:19,449 --> 01:22:22,118
(this guest has come to make them go wilder.)

1929
01:22:22,119 --> 01:22:24,858
(Burning excitement)

1930
01:22:24,859 --> 01:22:28,099
(The band and the members put on playful performances.)

1931
01:22:28,100 --> 01:22:31,205
(And they put on performances, full of emotions too.)

1932
01:22:32,000 --> 01:22:34,915
(Their sharp group choreography will be revealed.)

1933
01:22:36,239 --> 01:22:38,709
(And this song will be the grand finale.)

1934
01:22:38,710 --> 01:22:42,278
(It will be remembered in a corner of their heart for a long time.)

1935
01:22:42,279 --> 01:22:44,749
(And it's time to arrest the spy at last.)

1936
01:22:44,750 --> 01:22:47,848
(Many accounts of the spy will be reported.)

1937
01:22:47,849 --> 01:22:49,018
Is it Se Chan?

1938
01:22:49,019 --> 01:22:51,548
(Members who seemed unusual will be pointed out.)

1939
01:22:51,549 --> 01:22:52,888
I really wasn't sure.

1940
01:22:52,889 --> 01:22:57,119
(Will they be able to finish the fan-meet successfully?)

1941
01:22:57,120 --> 01:22:59,764
(Nine Years of Running Man: The Grand Finale)
