1
00:00:05,740 --> 00:00:08,085
- Hello. - Hi.

2
00:00:08,309 --> 00:00:09,838
Hello.

3
00:00:09,839 --> 00:00:11,139
- Hi. - Hello.

4
00:00:11,140 --> 00:00:12,479
- Hi. - Hi.

5
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:14,048
Is it nice to meet us?

6
00:00:14,049 --> 00:00:15,779
(Is it nice to meet us?)

7
00:00:15,780 --> 00:00:17,349
- "Is it nice to meet us?" - Hold on.

8
00:00:17,350 --> 00:00:18,648
- Be quiet. - "Is it nice to meet us?"

9
00:00:18,649 --> 00:00:20,548
They didn't hear me. Be quiet.

10
00:00:20,549 --> 00:00:22,348
Let's go inside and take a seat.

11
00:00:22,349 --> 00:00:23,718
Hey, Ji Hyo.

12
00:00:23,719 --> 00:00:25,019
(He spots something.)

13
00:00:25,020 --> 00:00:26,628
- What? - Your pants...

14
00:00:26,629 --> 00:00:28,828
- It's fashionable. - It's like you downsized the jeans.

15
00:00:28,829 --> 00:00:30,159
You just put a button over here.

16
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:31,904
- No. - You just pulled it hard.

17
00:00:32,160 --> 00:00:33,369
Your jeans look unique.

18
00:00:33,370 --> 00:00:34,968
I see. That's how it's designed.

19
00:00:34,969 --> 00:00:36,544
- Yes, that's right. - That's how it was designed?

20
00:00:36,870 --> 00:00:39,068
- It looks like something is off. - It was designed this way.

21
00:00:39,069 --> 00:00:40,668
They don't look weird.

22
00:00:40,669 --> 00:00:43,108
By the way, you don't feel nervous, do you?

23
00:00:43,109 --> 00:00:44,839
- What do you mean? - The fan-meet is over.

24
00:00:44,840 --> 00:00:46,884
No, I've been nervous continuously.

25
00:00:47,379 --> 00:00:48,649
How should I put it?

26
00:00:48,650 --> 00:00:50,954
He's a professional. He really is.

27
00:00:51,080 --> 00:00:52,949
- You ought to be on your toes. - Right.

28
00:00:52,950 --> 00:00:54,049
- Of course. - That's just me.

29
00:00:54,050 --> 00:00:55,918
- I don't mean that. - We ought to be on our best game.

30
00:00:55,919 --> 00:00:57,918
A part of my chest felt nervous for some reason.

31
00:00:57,919 --> 00:01:00,388
That's not where your chest is. Isn't that where your pancreas is?

32
00:01:00,389 --> 00:01:03,034
(That's not where your chest is. Isn't that where your pancreas is?)

33
00:01:03,099 --> 00:01:04,528
- Or ribs. - Do you have a bad pancreas?

34
00:01:04,529 --> 00:01:05,659
That's terrible.

35
00:01:05,660 --> 00:01:07,168
- Which organ is that? - They are driving me crazy.

36
00:01:07,169 --> 00:01:09,028
- This is where my chest is. - I see.

37
00:01:09,029 --> 00:01:11,069
This is where my heart is, so my chest should be here.

38
00:01:11,070 --> 00:01:13,108
It's because you pointed out that your heart is at the bottom.

39
00:01:13,109 --> 00:01:15,268
- Why are you joining in? - What?

40
00:01:15,269 --> 00:01:17,479
(Why are you joining in?)

41
00:01:17,480 --> 00:01:18,979
- When he's talking, be quiet. - What do you mean?

42
00:01:18,980 --> 00:01:21,149
You were pointing to some weird part, that's why.

43
00:01:21,150 --> 00:01:22,649
I just went like this.

44
00:01:22,650 --> 00:01:24,048
(Taking turns teasing Seok Jin.)

45
00:01:24,049 --> 00:01:25,248
Actually,

46
00:01:25,249 --> 00:01:27,349
we recorded the fan-meet quite a long time ago,

47
00:01:27,350 --> 00:01:29,819
- but the final one aired yesterday. - That's right.

48
00:01:29,820 --> 00:01:32,434
- I like that song. SORAN's song. - Which one?

49
00:01:33,059 --> 00:01:34,259
(Jeon SORAN and Yu Jae Seok feel proud.)

50
00:01:34,260 --> 00:01:35,459
I see.

51
00:01:35,460 --> 00:01:37,658
- The lyrics were really good. - I told you.

52
00:01:37,659 --> 00:01:39,058
- I told you it was the best song. - Right. Their song was great.

53
00:01:39,059 --> 00:01:42,268
The lyrics were completely based on So Min's experience.

54
00:01:42,269 --> 00:01:44,168
By the way, you wrote such great lyrics.

55
00:01:44,169 --> 00:01:45,268
The lyrics were great.

56
00:01:45,269 --> 00:01:47,308
The lyrics were trendy.

57
00:01:47,309 --> 00:01:49,578
You should write the lyrics for Jong Kook's new album.

58
00:01:49,579 --> 00:01:50,979
- What? - For Jong Kook's new album.

59
00:01:50,980 --> 00:01:52,138
- No, no. - Jong Kook...

60
00:01:52,139 --> 00:01:53,879
- Jong Kook. - That'd be great.

61
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:56,255
He talks like that when he really hates something.

62
00:01:56,650 --> 00:01:58,918
Her lyrics are great, but they don't match me.

63
00:01:58,919 --> 00:02:00,089
- She can make it work. - They don't suit my song.

64
00:02:00,090 --> 00:02:01,289
Why don't you like them?

65
00:02:01,290 --> 00:02:02,388
- No, they are great. - I really liked them.

66
00:02:02,389 --> 00:02:03,959
I asked her to write lyrics for my song.

67
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:05,619
- For your song? - He wanted them for a reggae song.

68
00:02:05,620 --> 00:02:07,904
I asked her to write lyrics for a reggae song.

69
00:02:07,960 --> 00:02:10,058
Haha, there's one about fried chicken.

70
00:02:10,059 --> 00:02:12,099
- Fried chicken? - Is that for a ballad song?

71
00:02:12,100 --> 00:02:14,099
Yes, it's for a ballad song or a song with a medium tempo.

72
00:02:14,100 --> 00:02:16,069
- "Medium tempo"? - "Medium tempo"?

73
00:02:16,070 --> 00:02:18,444
- "Medium tempo"? - She's a lyricist now.

74
00:02:19,169 --> 00:02:21,738
I'm glad So Min wrote the lyrics with her past relationships.

75
00:02:21,739 --> 00:02:23,039
Ji Hyo has a lot to talk about too,

76
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:24,309
- but she doesn't talk about them. - Right.

77
00:02:24,310 --> 00:02:26,279
Ji Hyo, your lyrics were great too.

78
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:29,048
I listened to your lyrics once. They sounded like they were rated R.

79
00:02:29,049 --> 00:02:30,224
"Rated R"?

80
00:02:30,679 --> 00:02:31,925
They are rated R?

81
00:02:32,350 --> 00:02:33,849
Yes, mine is lethal.

82
00:02:33,850 --> 00:02:35,548
- It's lethal? That's great. - right.

83
00:02:35,549 --> 00:02:37,365
(It's lethal)

84
00:02:37,919 --> 00:02:39,928
(It's lethal)

85
00:02:39,929 --> 00:02:42,729
(The "Don't Give It to Me" pair returns.)

86
00:02:42,730 --> 00:02:44,305
What's he doing? My gosh.

87
00:02:44,359 --> 00:02:45,759
- I thought it was another song. - That killed the mood.

88
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:47,129
It didn't sound like a recent song.

89
00:02:47,130 --> 00:02:48,768
He killed the mood with just one line.

90
00:02:48,769 --> 00:02:51,168
We were having fun. Things were going great, but you killed it.

91
00:02:51,169 --> 00:02:52,914
- You ruined the mood. - That was...

92
00:02:53,109 --> 00:02:55,638
- That clip... - Okay.

93
00:02:55,639 --> 00:02:58,178
Everyone went crazy, talking about how pretty she looked.

94
00:02:58,179 --> 00:02:59,724
No one talked about you at all.

95
00:03:00,380 --> 00:03:02,849
- Seriously. - You should look for a comment.

96
00:03:02,850 --> 00:03:04,618
- No one talked about you. - You know what?

97
00:03:04,619 --> 00:03:06,249
- People said I was a great rapper. - "Ji Hyo is pretty."

98
00:03:06,250 --> 00:03:08,719
- No. - Did you know that?

99
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:10,388
- Goodness. - Even our fans knew...

100
00:03:10,389 --> 00:03:12,358
- that he tried hard. - People said he tried hard.

101
00:03:12,359 --> 00:03:13,759
- Seriously. - Goodness.

102
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:16,828
Everyone, try to remember the choreography.

103
00:03:16,829 --> 00:03:18,705
Let's perform again on Seok Jin's 80th birthday.

104
00:03:19,929 --> 00:03:21,368
- I'm serious. - Can you guys do it?

105
00:03:21,369 --> 00:03:23,474
- You'll be in your 60s and 70s. - We can pull this off...

106
00:03:23,639 --> 00:03:27,268
We can pull this off even on his 80th birthday.

107
00:03:27,269 --> 00:03:28,368
- That's right. - Let's start on his 60th birthday.

108
00:03:28,369 --> 00:03:30,479
- We can do the turns on the table. - Exactly.

109
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:32,539
- Let's start on his 60th birthday. - Yes.

110
00:03:32,540 --> 00:03:34,409
He will turn 60 pretty soon.

111
00:03:34,410 --> 00:03:36,048
- There are only 6 years left? - 6 years.

112
00:03:36,049 --> 00:03:37,555
- Yes. - Seven years.

113
00:03:37,649 --> 00:03:38,819
- 6 years. - Until your 60th birthday.

114
00:03:38,820 --> 00:03:39,949
- 7 years. - 6 years.

115
00:03:39,950 --> 00:03:41,148
- It's 6 years. You're 54. - By the way...

116
00:03:41,149 --> 00:03:43,018
- There are 7 years left. - You're 54 years old.

117
00:03:43,019 --> 00:03:45,159
- International age-wise... - Don't count international age.

118
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:47,388
- Don't count international age. - You're supposed to count that!

119
00:03:47,389 --> 00:03:48,858
Besides, you were born in February.

120
00:03:48,859 --> 00:03:51,135
- Chan Hee, am I wrong or what? - Lately...

121
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:55,029
Chan Hee. Don't we count international age for that?

122
00:03:55,030 --> 00:03:57,898
- He's 54. - Why did you bring him into this?

123
00:03:57,899 --> 00:03:59,738
- 61 years old. - I have 8 years to go.

124
00:03:59,739 --> 00:04:02,145
That's unbelievable.

125
00:04:02,209 --> 00:04:05,379
In autumn, the sky is high, and the horses grow fat.

126
00:04:05,380 --> 00:04:07,208
You laugh at the rolling leaves. And the fleeting breeze...

127
00:04:07,209 --> 00:04:08,548
I don't think Kwang Soo knows what that means.

128
00:04:08,549 --> 00:04:10,178
- No, I know what it means. - "High sky and plump horses".

129
00:04:10,179 --> 00:04:12,654
- "High sky and plump horses". - It doesn't mean literally.

130
00:04:12,750 --> 00:04:14,618
- "High sky and plump horses". - I really know what this means.

131
00:04:14,619 --> 00:04:17,289
Isn't it when horses' ears get fat or something?

132
00:04:17,290 --> 00:04:18,618
- It's not the ears. - Not the ears...

133
00:04:18,619 --> 00:04:20,964
(Isn't it when horses' ears get fat or something?)

134
00:04:21,359 --> 00:04:22,528
- You're the worst. - No way.

135
00:04:22,529 --> 00:04:24,929
- Are you serious? You don't know? - Kwang Soo. You don't know?

136
00:04:24,930 --> 00:04:27,499
- You two shouldn't mock me. - Hey.

137
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:29,838
- No, we know what this means. - You two shouldn't tease me.

138
00:04:29,839 --> 00:04:30,999
- It's the trio of dummies. - You really don't know?

139
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,939
This is such basic knowledge. I can't write them, but I know them.

140
00:04:32,940 --> 00:04:34,009
- I see. - Do you know what that means?

141
00:04:34,010 --> 00:04:36,978
- What does that mean? - It means the weather is great now.

142
00:04:36,979 --> 00:04:38,208
That's right.

143
00:04:38,209 --> 00:04:40,249
(I survived.)

144
00:04:40,250 --> 00:04:41,978
Since the weather is great in autumn,

145
00:04:41,979 --> 00:04:43,518
you laugh at the rolling leaves.

146
00:04:43,519 --> 00:04:45,978
And the fleeting breeze inspires you to write poems.

147
00:04:45,979 --> 00:04:46,989
- What? - Poems?

148
00:04:46,990 --> 00:04:48,189
It's the season of men.

149
00:04:48,190 --> 00:04:51,359
Before we start the race, to satisfy your flooding inspirations,

150
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:54,458
- we'll have a poetry contest. - Poetry contest?

151
00:04:54,459 --> 00:04:56,028
Gosh, I'm terrible at these.

152
00:04:56,029 --> 00:04:57,559
- This is perfect for So Min. - So Min.

153
00:04:57,560 --> 00:04:59,259
- No. - This special is for you.

154
00:04:59,260 --> 00:05:01,468
- So Min is great at writing poems. - That's right.

155
00:05:01,469 --> 00:05:05,268
Please write a poem about the member sitting next to you.

156
00:05:05,269 --> 00:05:07,169
I have the best member sitting next to me today.

157
00:05:07,170 --> 00:05:08,468
I have Seok Jin.

158
00:05:08,469 --> 00:05:09,908
Then I write about Jae Seok, right?

159
00:05:09,909 --> 00:05:11,309
- That's right. - I'll write about Haha.

160
00:05:11,310 --> 00:05:13,408
- I'll write about Kwang Soo, right? - That's right.

161
00:05:13,409 --> 00:05:16,919
Do I have to write the poem, following the rules of poetry?

162
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:19,354
- You can write however you want. - That was...

163
00:05:19,550 --> 00:05:21,619
Are we at a school right now? Some school in Cheonghak-dong?

164
00:05:21,620 --> 00:05:22,819
"Although I do this..."

165
00:05:22,820 --> 00:05:25,319
With the evaluation, three of you will end up with only eat rice...

166
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:26,859
- and dried lavers. - No!

167
00:05:26,860 --> 00:05:28,935
The five of you will have chicken kalguksu.

168
00:05:29,289 --> 00:05:31,458
- It's already a meal mission? - Who will be the judge?

169
00:05:31,459 --> 00:05:32,658
(The opening segment starts with a meal mission?)

170
00:05:32,659 --> 00:05:33,745
All right.

171
00:05:34,029 --> 00:05:36,315
- Can I play music while I write? - Music?

172
00:05:36,570 --> 00:05:37,869
(Streaming his song)

173
00:05:37,870 --> 00:05:39,838
- Why are you suddenly playing that? - I need to get inspired.

174
00:05:39,839 --> 00:05:41,268
Why are you suddenly promoting the song?

175
00:05:41,269 --> 00:05:42,268
- I mean... - That will confuse us.

176
00:05:42,269 --> 00:05:44,354
- I'm not trying to promote it. - It's going to confuse us.

177
00:05:45,110 --> 00:05:46,749
- Is this how you'll promote it? - Hey.

178
00:05:46,750 --> 00:05:48,049
- Seok Jin. - What's this?

179
00:05:48,050 --> 00:05:49,154
(Seok Jin, let's promote our song.)

180
00:05:50,050 --> 00:05:51,449
(Pink Nose Light gets up.)

181
00:05:51,450 --> 00:05:53,749
(He streams the song by singing.)

182
00:05:53,750 --> 00:05:56,518
(Are you watching this, Apink?)

183
00:05:56,519 --> 00:05:58,594
Gosh, seriously. That's so terrible.

184
00:05:59,060 --> 00:06:00,505
That's nasty.

185
00:06:01,089 --> 00:06:03,958
(Promoting Brothers for "Party")

186
00:06:03,959 --> 00:06:05,629
(Please stream "Party" a lot.)

187
00:06:05,630 --> 00:06:07,275
All right. Get your papers.

188
00:06:08,570 --> 00:06:10,638
You usually write poems at night.

189
00:06:10,639 --> 00:06:13,114
- That's when you feel emotional. - "Song Ji Hyo".

190
00:06:13,570 --> 00:06:15,208
(Everyone focuses on writing their poem.)

191
00:06:15,209 --> 00:06:16,208
- The title... - "Kwang Soo."

192
00:06:16,209 --> 00:06:17,984
Do I have to write a title?

193
00:06:19,039 --> 00:06:20,385
Hold on.

194
00:06:20,409 --> 00:06:23,294
This is awesome. You have to thank me later.

195
00:06:23,779 --> 00:06:25,094
Can I write a long one?

196
00:06:25,149 --> 00:06:26,695
Gosh, an acrostic poem...

197
00:06:26,849 --> 00:06:29,759
"You, punk. Kwang Soo, you punk. You're like a sorghum straw."

198
00:06:29,760 --> 00:06:30,895
Is that it?

199
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:32,189
This is it.

200
00:06:32,190 --> 00:06:35,629
This is a poem. Don't make it complicated, Kwang Soo.

201
00:06:35,630 --> 00:06:36,629
(That's a poem?)

202
00:06:36,630 --> 00:06:39,275
(Zealously writing his poem)

203
00:06:39,700 --> 00:06:41,174
Hey, that was terrible.

204
00:06:41,269 --> 00:06:44,138
"I saw your eyes spinning after you drank." What's that?

205
00:06:44,139 --> 00:06:45,999
- Come on. - It's just a poem.

206
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,669
(That's a poem about So Min?)

207
00:06:48,670 --> 00:06:51,638
- Let me explain. I'm practicing. - When did that happen?

208
00:06:51,639 --> 00:06:53,949
- "Your eyes spinning after..." - It's because...

209
00:06:53,950 --> 00:06:55,125
You...

210
00:06:55,149 --> 00:06:58,278
When we drink together, I sometimes see only the whites of her eyes.

211
00:06:58,279 --> 00:06:59,619
It's when you get mad.

212
00:06:59,620 --> 00:07:03,195
(They finish writing the poems while expressing their affection.)

213
00:07:03,690 --> 00:07:04,888
Shall I go first?

214
00:07:04,889 --> 00:07:06,505
- Jae Seok will go first. - Okay.

215
00:07:06,659 --> 00:07:08,759
If you think it's complicated, you can't write poems.

216
00:07:08,760 --> 00:07:09,759
Right, right.

217
00:07:09,760 --> 00:07:11,398
Title, "Lee Kwang Soo".

218
00:07:11,399 --> 00:07:12,658
(Title: "Lee Kwang Soo")

219
00:07:12,659 --> 00:07:14,904
"What do you do?"

220
00:07:15,130 --> 00:07:16,674
"Are you an actor?"

221
00:07:17,269 --> 00:07:18,674
"Are you a model?"

222
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,614
"Are you a comedian?"

223
00:07:20,839 --> 00:07:23,078
"What do you do?"

224
00:07:23,079 --> 00:07:24,638
"I get it."

225
00:07:24,639 --> 00:07:28,749
- "You're just Sun Bin's boyfriend." - What was that?

226
00:07:28,750 --> 00:07:30,348
(You're just Sun Bin's boyfriend.)

227
00:07:30,349 --> 00:07:31,854
That's not a poem.

228
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:33,388
- No, it is. - That can't be a poem.

229
00:07:33,389 --> 00:07:34,888
This is trendy nowadays.

230
00:07:34,889 --> 00:07:36,458
There has to be a punch line at the end.

231
00:07:36,459 --> 00:07:38,359
You had a twist at the end. It was a poem with a twist.

232
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:41,259
Jae Seok, that was nice. It was good.

233
00:07:41,260 --> 00:07:42,898
This is the trend nowadays.

234
00:07:42,899 --> 00:07:45,104
There must be a punch line at the end.

235
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:49,169
You set it up in the beginning and had a twist at the end.

236
00:07:49,170 --> 00:07:51,038
- That's right. - That's the trend.

237
00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:53,268
- Here's my next poem. - He wrote a letter.

238
00:07:53,269 --> 00:07:54,638
- You wrote a lot of short poems. - Yes.

239
00:07:54,639 --> 00:07:56,208
- "Lee Kwang Soo". - "Lee Kwang Soo".

240
00:07:56,209 --> 00:07:57,955
"I can tell you now."

241
00:07:58,209 --> 00:07:59,455
"You are..."

242
00:08:00,010 --> 00:08:02,224
"I can tell you now."

243
00:08:02,409 --> 00:08:04,654
"Actually, you..."

244
00:08:05,180 --> 00:08:06,724
"look better with your mustache."

245
00:08:06,990 --> 00:08:08,094
That's a poem?

246
00:08:08,490 --> 00:08:11,794
(I can only tell you now.)

247
00:08:12,159 --> 00:08:13,804
That was so well-written.

248
00:08:13,889 --> 00:08:15,359
It started off nicely, but I love your twist at the end.

249
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:16,734
Yes, there's a twist.

250
00:08:17,260 --> 00:08:20,129
This is how people write poems. I included images people have...

251
00:08:20,130 --> 00:08:22,028
- Kids would write better than you. - of Kwang Soo in the poems.

252
00:08:22,029 --> 00:08:23,138
This is a trendy poem.

253
00:08:23,139 --> 00:08:25,544
He can write poems so quickly.

254
00:08:25,670 --> 00:08:26,939
This is it.

255
00:08:26,940 --> 00:08:29,385
Jae Seok's poems make me wait for the twist.

256
00:08:30,010 --> 00:08:32,009
Title, "So Min".

257
00:08:32,010 --> 00:08:33,179
(Title: "So Min")

258
00:08:33,180 --> 00:08:34,455
"I saw..."

259
00:08:34,779 --> 00:08:36,495
"your eyes spinning after you drank."

260
00:08:37,219 --> 00:08:39,649
(Come on.)

261
00:08:39,650 --> 00:08:40,865
"I saw..."

262
00:08:41,390 --> 00:08:43,365
"your words getting rough after you drank."

263
00:08:43,959 --> 00:08:45,595
- When did I... - "I saw..."

264
00:08:46,119 --> 00:08:47,758
"your hands throwing the table after you drank."

265
00:08:47,759 --> 00:08:49,904
- Really? - I saw that too.

266
00:08:49,999 --> 00:08:54,145
"You have spinning eyes, a rough mouth, and violent hands,"

267
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:55,304
"so you're crazy."

268
00:08:56,570 --> 00:08:58,468
(In the end, she's just crazy.)

269
00:08:58,469 --> 00:09:01,368
There's no twist here. His poem doesn't have a twist.

270
00:09:01,369 --> 00:09:03,039
I thought he'd put in a twist.

271
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:05,309
- I made the ending cute. - I thought he'd put in a twist.

272
00:09:05,310 --> 00:09:06,625
That was nice.

273
00:09:06,950 --> 00:09:09,584
Kwang Soo, I can totally relate to that.

274
00:09:10,050 --> 00:09:12,855
By the way, this story is really sad for me.

275
00:09:13,550 --> 00:09:15,525
So you guys don't even call me now?

276
00:09:16,690 --> 00:09:20,029
(You're not calling me since I'm married?)

277
00:09:20,030 --> 00:09:21,258
- You're 40 now. - Hey.

278
00:09:21,259 --> 00:09:23,828
- You're with us now. - You're 40 now.

279
00:09:23,829 --> 00:09:24,998
- Hey. - Hey, you should roll with us now.

280
00:09:24,999 --> 00:09:26,498
- I probably won't join anyway... - Don't join them.

281
00:09:26,499 --> 00:09:28,529
I probably won't join, but now you won't even call?

282
00:09:28,530 --> 00:09:29,569
(Feeling upset)

283
00:09:29,570 --> 00:09:31,899
- Hey, that's better. - "That's better"?

284
00:09:31,900 --> 00:09:34,885
I got a video call around 1 a.m...

285
00:09:35,009 --> 00:09:36,654
- from Kwang Soo. He missed me. - Why?

286
00:09:37,180 --> 00:09:39,309
He asked me if I wanted to come out, and I said I would.

287
00:09:39,310 --> 00:09:41,084
I told him to send me the address and I would head out then.

288
00:09:41,379 --> 00:09:42,649
After that, he didn't answer my call.

289
00:09:42,650 --> 00:09:44,919
(After that, he didn't answer my call.)

290
00:09:44,920 --> 00:09:47,794
(When he said he would come out, he couldn't reach Kwang Soo.)

291
00:09:47,989 --> 00:09:49,525
I kept calling him,

292
00:09:49,619 --> 00:09:51,059
and I got mad.

293
00:09:51,060 --> 00:09:53,164
- I'm sorry. - Why do you do that?

294
00:09:53,359 --> 00:09:54,664
- I'm sorry. - Why are you so mean?

295
00:09:54,989 --> 00:09:57,674
- "Did he play me or what?" - He does that when he gets drunk.

296
00:09:57,859 --> 00:09:59,769
- Hey, are you making fun of him? - I'm sorry.

297
00:09:59,770 --> 00:10:01,098
- No, no. It's not that. - Is that it?

298
00:10:01,099 --> 00:10:02,304
I'm sorry.

299
00:10:02,499 --> 00:10:04,074
He wouldn't answer my call after he said he missed me.

300
00:10:04,499 --> 00:10:07,069
You just wanted to say you missed him, but Seok Jin was going to join.

301
00:10:07,070 --> 00:10:09,208
- I didn't know he'd come out. - So he was uncomfortable.

302
00:10:09,209 --> 00:10:10,909
(They resume presenting the poems.)

303
00:10:10,910 --> 00:10:12,084
So Min.

304
00:10:12,680 --> 00:10:13,878
Actually...

305
00:10:13,879 --> 00:10:15,679
- She's our official poet. - No, no.

306
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:16,954
Crazy Poet.

307
00:10:17,280 --> 00:10:18,495
"A flower has blossomed."

308
00:10:18,920 --> 00:10:22,248
"No one knows when the flower blossomed."

309
00:10:22,249 --> 00:10:24,059
"But a small flower has blossomed."

310
00:10:24,060 --> 00:10:25,159
"Matured in time,"

311
00:10:25,160 --> 00:10:27,334
"it withers away and blossoms. And it repeats."

312
00:10:27,829 --> 00:10:29,728
(She's indeed a poet.)

313
00:10:29,729 --> 00:10:33,304
"When fallen flowers cover it up like dots,"

314
00:10:33,570 --> 00:10:35,669
- "the flowers..." - Hey.

315
00:10:35,670 --> 00:10:37,368
Hold on. Are you trying to...

316
00:10:37,369 --> 00:10:38,699
bid farewell to Seok Jin?

317
00:10:38,700 --> 00:10:41,215
By "dots", do you mean the end?

318
00:10:41,910 --> 00:10:44,654
- Isn't this like a eulogy? - I mean...

319
00:10:45,079 --> 00:10:46,809
- Let me finish. - You're suddenly sending him off.

320
00:10:46,810 --> 00:10:48,284
- What was that? - Okay.

321
00:10:48,479 --> 00:10:51,324
"Traces of life, Jee Seok Jin".

322
00:10:51,379 --> 00:10:53,848
- "Traces of life"? - "Jee Seok Jin".

323
00:10:53,849 --> 00:10:54,889
What is it?

324
00:10:54,890 --> 00:10:57,194
"Tread on it lightly and go on your path."

325
00:10:57,489 --> 00:10:58,965
- I know what she's doing. - What is it?

326
00:10:59,259 --> 00:11:01,889
In "Along with the Gods", when your name is called thrice,

327
00:11:01,890 --> 00:11:03,275
- you go to the underworld. - Really?

328
00:11:03,700 --> 00:11:07,098
(If the Grim Reaper calls your name thrice, you leave this world.)

329
00:11:07,099 --> 00:11:08,944
- "Jee Seok Jin". - This?

330
00:11:09,900 --> 00:11:12,069
- Jee Seok Jin. - Really?

331
00:11:12,070 --> 00:11:13,508
Have you gone mad?

332
00:11:13,509 --> 00:11:14,669
Why are you sending me away?

333
00:11:14,670 --> 00:11:16,008
The title is "Flower in the Underworld".

334
00:11:16,009 --> 00:11:17,378
(She's definitely sending him off.)

335
00:11:17,379 --> 00:11:20,149
(So Min's poem gave him a chance to look back on his life.)

336
00:11:20,150 --> 00:11:22,309
- This is making me cry. - I actually cried.

337
00:11:22,310 --> 00:11:24,348
Our show definitely moves people's hearts.

338
00:11:24,349 --> 00:11:25,924
I wrote a short one.

339
00:11:26,550 --> 00:11:27,664
Actually,

340
00:11:28,150 --> 00:11:32,334
a lot of people want to know about Ji Hyo.

341
00:11:32,390 --> 00:11:33,804
They want to know what she's like.

342
00:11:34,459 --> 00:11:36,034
She's so mysterious.

343
00:11:36,290 --> 00:11:39,304
I don't think anyone is listening to him.

344
00:11:39,499 --> 00:11:41,044
- You're listening, right? - Ji Hyo.

345
00:11:41,300 --> 00:11:42,968
- This is about you. - Okay.

346
00:11:42,969 --> 00:11:44,814
- Jae Seok, you're listening, right? - Yes.

347
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:46,639
Listen up. Listen to my poem.

348
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:48,515
I was listening. I just got inspired.

349
00:11:48,910 --> 00:11:49,978
"Song Ji Hyo".

350
00:11:49,979 --> 00:11:51,279
(He begins whether they listen or not.)

351
00:11:51,280 --> 00:11:54,824
"You're a quiet child."

352
00:11:55,579 --> 00:11:57,218
"However, when you yell out of anger,"

353
00:11:57,219 --> 00:11:58,625
"you become Freddie Mercury."

354
00:12:00,119 --> 00:12:01,895
"You're considerate."

355
00:12:02,589 --> 00:12:05,095
"However, I'm the only one you didn't send the dried herring."

356
00:12:05,959 --> 00:12:08,228
(He's asking her about the dried herring years ago.)

357
00:12:08,229 --> 00:12:09,735
He's so petty.

358
00:12:09,959 --> 00:12:11,174
That was ages ago.

359
00:12:11,229 --> 00:12:12,574
"You're beautiful."

360
00:12:13,300 --> 00:12:14,574
"I can't deny your beauty."

361
00:12:14,969 --> 00:12:18,145
"The most beautiful lady on Running Man, Song Ji Hyo."

362
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:20,414
This is it.

363
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:23,238
- I don't know how to respond to it. - That's it?

364
00:12:23,239 --> 00:12:24,738
- That was... - This is all.

365
00:12:24,739 --> 00:12:26,078
- He likes... - What?

366
00:12:26,079 --> 00:12:27,855
eating rice with dried laver.

367
00:12:29,310 --> 00:12:30,919
You're almost addicted to dried laver.

368
00:12:30,920 --> 00:12:31,978
(Seok Jin aimed for last place.)

369
00:12:31,979 --> 00:12:34,965
("Song Ji Hyo")

370
00:12:34,989 --> 00:12:36,019
All right.

371
00:12:36,020 --> 00:12:37,934
"Autumn is known for its good weather."

372
00:12:38,290 --> 00:12:41,105
"The sky is high, and the man of autumn, Jong Kook,"

373
00:12:41,589 --> 00:12:44,674
"is raising his standards. And his muscles are getting fatter."

374
00:12:45,859 --> 00:12:48,745
"He just needs to meet the one who will warm his cold winter..."

375
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:51,569
"and starts a new life while fluttering the wedding veil..."

376
00:12:51,570 --> 00:12:53,174
Is your last line, "That's me"?

377
00:12:53,469 --> 00:12:54,715
Jae Seok.

378
00:12:54,739 --> 00:12:56,115
- What's happening? - No.

379
00:12:56,140 --> 00:12:58,485
- I didn't write that. - Right?

380
00:12:58,910 --> 00:13:00,584
"That's me."

381
00:13:01,079 --> 00:13:02,149
That's a twist.

382
00:13:02,150 --> 00:13:04,919
"When the autumn comes back again,"

383
00:13:04,920 --> 00:13:08,324
"I wish that you would spend the rest of your life..."

384
00:13:08,390 --> 00:13:12,395
"in warmth with a muscular child that resembles you."

385
00:13:13,259 --> 00:13:14,564
"And I'm right next to you."

386
00:13:14,660 --> 00:13:16,334
- "And I'm right next to you." - "And I'm right next to you."

387
00:13:16,359 --> 00:13:17,875
Read the last line.

388
00:13:18,129 --> 00:13:20,245
- "That's me." - Read it.

389
00:13:20,469 --> 00:13:21,944
- Read it. - Read it.

390
00:13:21,999 --> 00:13:25,375
(That's me.)

391
00:13:26,540 --> 00:13:30,414
("Kim Jong Kook")

392
00:13:30,839 --> 00:13:32,355
- All right. - Should I go next?

393
00:13:32,379 --> 00:13:33,679
- All right. - She wrote a letter.

394
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:34,824
I should get married.

395
00:13:35,050 --> 00:13:36,725
I should get married and be on "Same Life, Unlike Dreams".

396
00:13:37,650 --> 00:13:38,748
I don't think you can.

397
00:13:38,749 --> 00:13:40,118
(He sounds firm.)

398
00:13:40,119 --> 00:13:41,889
- Why not? - It will be hard.

399
00:13:41,890 --> 00:13:44,064
(Jae Seok's diagnosis after watching him on "Mom's Dairy")

400
00:13:44,089 --> 00:13:46,659
I should be doing this while I look at him.

401
00:13:46,660 --> 00:13:47,929
The title is "Se Cha Ni".

402
00:13:47,930 --> 00:13:49,635
It's "Se Cha Ni".

403
00:13:49,660 --> 00:13:51,034
- "Se Cha Ni". - I'll read it now.

404
00:13:51,129 --> 00:13:53,199
- That sounds cute. - I bet there's a punch line.

405
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:54,345
That sounds friendly.

406
00:13:54,629 --> 00:13:56,574
"Although his mouth is protruding,"

407
00:13:56,670 --> 00:13:58,314
"he tries not to stand out."

408
00:13:59,570 --> 00:14:01,015
"Although his knowledge is short,"

409
00:14:01,170 --> 00:14:02,684
"his thoughts are deep."

410
00:14:03,009 --> 00:14:04,478
That's a compliment.

411
00:14:04,479 --> 00:14:05,914
"My kind friend, Se Cha Ni".

412
00:14:05,940 --> 00:14:07,154
"Se Cha Ni".

413
00:14:07,950 --> 00:14:09,684
"As it's getting chilly,"

414
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:12,478
"just like this strong wind, I want Se Cha Ni..."

415
00:14:12,479 --> 00:14:13,765
"to push forward zealously."

416
00:14:15,020 --> 00:14:17,319
- What was that? - Jong Kook.

417
00:14:17,320 --> 00:14:18,988
- That was such a word of blessing. - My gosh.

418
00:14:18,989 --> 00:14:20,029
- I mean... - What was that?

419
00:14:20,030 --> 00:14:22,258
Imagine if Kwang Soo, Seok Jin, and I were sitting next to him.

420
00:14:22,259 --> 00:14:23,375
He wouldn't write something like that for us.

421
00:14:23,759 --> 00:14:25,899
- He's two-faced. - This is so infuriating.

422
00:14:25,900 --> 00:14:27,674
- I should expose you to the world. - Seriously.

423
00:14:28,530 --> 00:14:30,674
- You're unbelievable. - This is so upsetting.

424
00:14:30,839 --> 00:14:32,944
You made us look terrible with your poem.

425
00:14:33,670 --> 00:14:35,515
- That was so moving. - No, listen.

426
00:14:35,839 --> 00:14:38,039
Personally, I really cherish him.

427
00:14:38,040 --> 00:14:40,684
- My heart is pounding. - He's my guy, you know.

428
00:14:41,280 --> 00:14:42,608
I can write one like that.

429
00:14:42,609 --> 00:14:44,049
"Ji Hyo, you have short legs,"

430
00:14:44,050 --> 00:14:45,149
"but your thoughts aren't short-sighted."

431
00:14:45,150 --> 00:14:46,895
It's easy.

432
00:14:47,290 --> 00:14:48,848
Why would you say that I have short legs?

433
00:14:48,849 --> 00:14:50,458
- That's not how it goes. - What?

434
00:14:50,459 --> 00:14:52,465
"You have short-sighted thoughts, but you have a long waist."

435
00:14:53,790 --> 00:14:56,059
(She gets mad at their mention of her short legs and long waist.)

436
00:14:56,060 --> 00:14:57,505
Come on.

437
00:14:58,629 --> 00:15:02,404
("Se Cha Ni")

438
00:15:02,670 --> 00:15:04,838
After hearing Jong Kook's poem,

439
00:15:04,839 --> 00:15:06,314
- my poem sounds... - Hurry up.

440
00:15:06,339 --> 00:15:07,968
- Just go ahead. It's all right. - It's about Haha.

441
00:15:07,969 --> 00:15:09,069
Title,

442
00:15:09,070 --> 00:15:10,255
"Haha".

443
00:15:10,640 --> 00:15:12,515
"Grow big, grow big,"

444
00:15:12,540 --> 00:15:13,885
"I want everything to grow big."

445
00:15:14,709 --> 00:15:17,054
- That's like a magic spell. - "Shave it, shave it,"

446
00:15:17,249 --> 00:15:18,995
"I want you to shave that dirty mustache of yours."

447
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:22,218
(Shave it, shave it.)

448
00:15:22,219 --> 00:15:24,618
(I want you to shave that dirty mustache of yours.)

449
00:15:24,619 --> 00:15:26,258
(What was that?)

450
00:15:26,259 --> 00:15:28,029
(Everyone cracks up.)

451
00:15:28,030 --> 00:15:30,128
- It's dirty. - That's funny.

452
00:15:30,129 --> 00:15:32,904
"Stop it, stop it, stop acting young."

453
00:15:33,530 --> 00:15:35,475
(Feeling upset)

454
00:15:35,570 --> 00:15:37,074
"Yes, you are. Yes, you are."

455
00:15:37,170 --> 00:15:38,775
"You're also 40."

456
00:15:40,839 --> 00:15:42,608
- That was nice. - That was my poem.

457
00:15:42,609 --> 00:15:43,639
Great, great.

458
00:15:43,640 --> 00:15:45,108
- You wrote a nice one. - I went after Jong Kook.

459
00:15:45,109 --> 00:15:46,279
No, it was great.

460
00:15:46,280 --> 00:15:48,654
- It's my turn now. - I enjoyed that.

461
00:15:49,150 --> 00:15:52,054
The poem had advice Haha should listen to.

462
00:15:52,719 --> 00:15:54,465
- I'm looking forward to it. - I can't wait.

463
00:15:54,489 --> 00:15:55,794
- I can't wait. - Title,

464
00:15:56,719 --> 00:15:57,895
"Yu Jae Seok".

465
00:15:58,859 --> 00:16:00,605
"Hey, look."

466
00:16:01,190 --> 00:16:02,659
"Where are you going in a hurry?"

467
00:16:02,660 --> 00:16:04,828
What did he say? What's he talking about now?

468
00:16:04,829 --> 00:16:07,404
"Wherever I look,"

469
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:09,699
"you pop up ubiquitously."

470
00:16:09,700 --> 00:16:11,269
(He's on every TV station.)

471
00:16:11,270 --> 00:16:13,544
"It's as if you will be leaving tomorrow."

472
00:16:13,709 --> 00:16:15,515
"What's the rush in taking on everything?"

473
00:16:16,410 --> 00:16:19,084
"At this rate, you might have your own news segment."

474
00:16:20,349 --> 00:16:22,225
- "Hey, look." - News does suit him though.

475
00:16:22,910 --> 00:16:24,595
"I will chat with you,"

476
00:16:24,920 --> 00:16:26,654
"so you won't be lonely on your way out."

477
00:16:27,550 --> 00:16:29,265
"Hire me."

478
00:16:31,190 --> 00:16:33,965
(Hire me.)

479
00:16:34,989 --> 00:16:37,235
(Are they promising to be partners?)

480
00:16:38,329 --> 00:16:41,074
- The ending was the twist. - That was great.

481
00:16:41,369 --> 00:16:44,098
- My gosh. - That was funny.

482
00:16:44,099 --> 00:16:45,715
You're the best.

483
00:16:45,869 --> 00:16:47,584
That was the best.

484
00:16:47,670 --> 00:16:49,169
And he read the poem well too.

485
00:16:49,170 --> 00:16:51,215
- His voice was nice. He did well. - Right.

486
00:16:51,879 --> 00:16:55,449
- Now, we have eight of your poems. - Okay.

487
00:16:55,450 --> 00:16:58,319
Today will be a special episode to celebrate Hangeul Day.

488
00:16:58,320 --> 00:17:00,819
We have checked your spelling and spacing.

489
00:17:00,820 --> 00:17:03,088
- Really? - I almost thought about doing them.

490
00:17:03,089 --> 00:17:04,258
(Spelling and spacing are the criteria?)

491
00:17:04,259 --> 00:17:05,334
"Spelling"?

492
00:17:06,060 --> 00:17:08,328
We graded each poem based on spelling and spacing.

493
00:17:08,329 --> 00:17:10,498
Members in 1st place to 5th place will eat delicious chicken kalguksu.

494
00:17:10,499 --> 00:17:12,429
And the rest three members will only eat rice and dried lavers.

495
00:17:12,430 --> 00:17:14,899
But spelling and spacing are really hard.

496
00:17:14,900 --> 00:17:16,998
- The spacing is really hard. - It's really hard.

497
00:17:16,999 --> 00:17:20,245
And we asked you to write it by hand today for a reason.

498
00:17:20,269 --> 00:17:21,639
To celebrate Hangeul Day,

499
00:17:21,640 --> 00:17:23,639
you'll be creating a handwriting font.

500
00:17:23,640 --> 00:17:24,778
"A handwriting font"?

501
00:17:24,779 --> 00:17:27,708
Based on the handwriting from your poems,

502
00:17:27,709 --> 00:17:29,379
we plan to make a font out of it.

503
00:17:29,380 --> 00:17:31,149
And the winner of the race...

504
00:17:31,150 --> 00:17:33,079
will have the chance to create a font named after them.

505
00:17:33,080 --> 00:17:36,349
And we plan to distribute the font online, so anyone can download it.

506
00:17:36,350 --> 00:17:37,919
- Our own handwriting? - The name of the font...

507
00:17:37,920 --> 00:17:40,534
will have the member's name in it when distributed.

508
00:17:40,930 --> 00:17:43,699
I'm doomed. I didn't put any spacings in my lines.

509
00:17:43,700 --> 00:17:45,435
I don't usually put in spacings to begin with.

510
00:17:45,729 --> 00:17:46,874
It's not because you don't know how?

511
00:17:47,529 --> 00:17:48,528
I just don't add them.

512
00:17:48,529 --> 00:17:49,528
- You don't? - Why not?

513
00:17:49,529 --> 00:17:51,574
- So we have the result. - What is it?

514
00:17:51,969 --> 00:17:54,985
Jae Seok got 1 spelling wrong and missed 5 spacings.

515
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:56,915
- Really? - That's a lot.

516
00:17:56,940 --> 00:17:58,139
Why did I get so many errors?

517
00:17:58,140 --> 00:17:59,985
That's the total number of errors from the poems you submitted.

518
00:18:00,549 --> 00:18:02,884
Seok Jin, you missed five spacings.

519
00:18:03,080 --> 00:18:04,725
- He got all the spellings right. - Which ones did I get wrong?

520
00:18:05,479 --> 00:18:07,149
Jong Kook might find this unfair,

521
00:18:07,150 --> 00:18:09,324
- you wrote, "Se Cha Ni". - Why? I see.

522
00:18:09,519 --> 00:18:11,488
You misspelled 2 words and missed 1 spacing.

523
00:18:11,489 --> 00:18:13,859
- You have a total of three errors. - That's not a lot.

524
00:18:13,860 --> 00:18:15,465
- You didn't get anything wrong. - That's not a lot.

525
00:18:15,759 --> 00:18:17,998
Haha, you misspelled 1 word and missed 2 spacings.

526
00:18:17,999 --> 00:18:19,175
You have a total of three errors.

527
00:18:19,630 --> 00:18:22,044
- Hold on. - Haha wrote a long poem too.

528
00:18:22,370 --> 00:18:24,344
And Ji Hyo, you misspelled two words...

529
00:18:24,370 --> 00:18:25,614
and missed seven spacings.

530
00:18:26,840 --> 00:18:27,985
Spelling?

531
00:18:28,039 --> 00:18:29,708
- Which words did she misspell? - What did I get wrong?

532
00:18:29,709 --> 00:18:30,915
(Feeling embarrassed)

533
00:18:30,979 --> 00:18:32,084
She got the spelling wrong?

534
00:18:32,410 --> 00:18:33,909
- What did I get wrong? - That's a bit embarrassing.

535
00:18:33,910 --> 00:18:36,225
- You should know how to spell. - It's funny to see her flustered.

536
00:18:36,249 --> 00:18:37,495
She's flustered.

537
00:18:38,249 --> 00:18:40,589
Kwang Soo, you misspelled 1 word and missed 4 spacings.

538
00:18:40,590 --> 00:18:41,824
You have a total of five errors.

539
00:18:43,219 --> 00:18:45,488
So Min, you misspelled 2 words and missed 1 spacing.

540
00:18:45,489 --> 00:18:46,689
You have a total of three errors.

541
00:18:46,690 --> 00:18:47,958
- Really? - She did?

542
00:18:47,959 --> 00:18:49,359
Se Chan...

543
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:50,958
(Laughing)

544
00:18:50,959 --> 00:18:52,599
- What is it? - He misspelled only one word.

545
00:18:52,600 --> 00:18:54,175
But he missed 12 spacings.

546
00:18:55,100 --> 00:18:56,968
- You're the worst. - You should learn to write again.

547
00:18:56,969 --> 00:18:58,399
- Hey, I lost my affection. - Are you serious?

548
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:00,939
- Let's learn again. - This is crazy.

549
00:19:00,940 --> 00:19:03,978
- You should study it every day. - I really should.

550
00:19:03,979 --> 00:19:05,139
- 12? - So...

551
00:19:05,140 --> 00:19:07,308
The members who will only eat rice and dried lavers are...

552
00:19:07,309 --> 00:19:09,985
Jae Seok, Ji Hyo, and Se Chan. You'll get rice and dried lavers.

553
00:19:10,049 --> 00:19:11,978
- The rest of you will eat kalguksu. - Oh, my.

554
00:19:11,979 --> 00:19:13,354
- Yes! - It's kalguksu.

555
00:19:14,019 --> 00:19:15,294
- That sounds good. - Goodness.

556
00:19:16,450 --> 00:19:17,518
(This is a mouthwatering portion.)

557
00:19:17,519 --> 00:19:19,294
It's baby ginseng.

558
00:19:19,390 --> 00:19:22,064
The ginseng smells so good.

559
00:19:22,330 --> 00:19:23,929
- Look at the dumplings. - What should I do?

560
00:19:23,930 --> 00:19:25,905
This is amazing.

561
00:19:26,759 --> 00:19:28,369
This is good just with kimchi.

562
00:19:28,370 --> 00:19:29,369
(Thank you for the food.)

563
00:19:29,370 --> 00:19:30,568
This is so good.

564
00:19:30,569 --> 00:19:32,074
Potatoes?

565
00:19:32,499 --> 00:19:33,669
(He forgets about the camera and inhales the food.)

566
00:19:33,670 --> 00:19:34,884
This is good just with kimchi.

567
00:19:35,539 --> 00:19:36,644
Oh, dear.

568
00:19:38,140 --> 00:19:40,114
This kimchi is really good.

569
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:42,255
- What's wrong? - Kimchi.

570
00:19:42,509 --> 00:19:43,854
- Well... - Kimchi.

571
00:19:44,650 --> 00:19:46,195
- Dumplings... - Is it good?

572
00:19:46,319 --> 00:19:48,995
- The dumplings are so good. - Be quiet. Just eat.

573
00:19:49,019 --> 00:19:50,218
(Why are you picking on me?)

574
00:19:50,219 --> 00:19:51,334
Why?

575
00:19:52,019 --> 00:19:53,265
Be quiet.

576
00:19:53,420 --> 00:19:55,929
Let's start the race.

577
00:19:55,930 --> 00:19:58,604
(Today's race is about producing a font. The race starts.)

578
00:19:59,299 --> 00:20:01,975
Look at the rice maturing. It must really be fall.

579
00:20:01,999 --> 00:20:03,528
The persimmons too.

580
00:20:03,529 --> 00:20:05,768
As I told you earlier,

581
00:20:05,769 --> 00:20:08,538
this is a Hangeul Day Special at Cheongdo, known for persimmons.

582
00:20:08,539 --> 00:20:11,084
The race is called Those with Persimmons.

583
00:20:11,209 --> 00:20:13,314
There's an older member here with no good sense.

584
00:20:13,340 --> 00:20:14,525
An older member?

585
00:20:14,910 --> 00:20:16,849
- There's only one. - I'm the only older member.

586
00:20:16,850 --> 00:20:18,318
- Why? - There's only one.

587
00:20:18,319 --> 00:20:20,079
- Why is there only one? - I'm full of good senses.

588
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:22,689
I consider Jong Kook an older member sometimes.

589
00:20:22,690 --> 00:20:24,894
- Whatever. - I'm serious.

590
00:20:25,690 --> 00:20:28,258
There are four guests today.

591
00:20:28,259 --> 00:20:30,758
There will be four teams today for the race.

592
00:20:30,759 --> 00:20:33,058
- The guests are waiting. - Is that right?

593
00:20:33,059 --> 00:20:35,629
- Let's invite them first. - Let's have them join us.

594
00:20:35,630 --> 00:20:37,498
Guests, please come on out.

595
00:20:37,499 --> 00:20:38,814
They are inside the hanok.

596
00:20:38,940 --> 00:20:40,669
- Are they coming out at once? - Who is it?

597
00:20:40,670 --> 00:20:42,415
- Who is it? - Who is it?

598
00:20:42,969 --> 00:20:44,685
Yu Na! Mina!

599
00:20:45,279 --> 00:20:47,308
- Tiffany! - It's Tiffany.

600
00:20:47,309 --> 00:20:49,208
- It's been such a long time. - Chi Yeul.

601
00:20:49,209 --> 00:20:50,849
(Singer and Actress Kang Mina, Actress Park Yu Na,)

602
00:20:50,850 --> 00:20:52,349
(Singer and Musical Actress Tiffany, Singer Hwang Chi Yeul)

603
00:20:52,350 --> 00:20:54,119
- Hello. - My gosh.

604
00:20:54,120 --> 00:20:55,364
- Chi Yeul. - Hello.

605
00:20:55,390 --> 00:20:57,288
- It's been a while, Chi Yeul. - We meet again.

606
00:20:57,289 --> 00:20:59,258
- It's been such a long time. - He lost so much weight.

607
00:20:59,259 --> 00:21:01,558
- He's back. - You look even more handsome now.

608
00:21:01,559 --> 00:21:03,089
- Stand in the middle. - You lost so much weight.

609
00:21:03,090 --> 00:21:04,359
You lost weight.

610
00:21:04,360 --> 00:21:06,528
How long has it been?

611
00:21:06,529 --> 00:21:09,068
It's been such a long time, Mina.

612
00:21:09,069 --> 00:21:10,439
- Yes. - Right.

613
00:21:10,440 --> 00:21:13,074
In January 2018,

614
00:21:13,100 --> 00:21:15,008
- she joined us on Jeju Island. - Right.

615
00:21:15,009 --> 00:21:16,869
That's right.

616
00:21:16,870 --> 00:21:20,755
She was in a drama that finished recently.

617
00:21:20,779 --> 00:21:24,478
Yu Na was in it as well.

618
00:21:24,479 --> 00:21:26,955
- It was "Hotel Del Luna". - Yes, right.

619
00:21:27,090 --> 00:21:29,025
This drama got the whole country excited.

620
00:21:29,219 --> 00:21:30,359
(Kwang Soo proves himself to be a devoted fan.)

621
00:21:30,360 --> 00:21:32,094
- I didn't watch it. - Did you watch it?

622
00:21:32,289 --> 00:21:34,905
Isn't it your backside that has the whole country excited?

623
00:21:35,690 --> 00:21:37,374
- Jong Kook. - Don't mention that.

624
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:39,558
We decided not to talk about it.

625
00:21:39,559 --> 00:21:41,568
- Don't mention that. - Goodness.

626
00:21:41,569 --> 00:21:42,728
Dooly's grandpa.

627
00:21:42,729 --> 00:21:43,998
I agree.

628
00:21:43,999 --> 00:21:45,869
- What's that? - Dooly's grandpa.

629
00:21:45,870 --> 00:21:46,869
You're scrawny.

630
00:21:46,870 --> 00:21:48,568
- That totally suits him. - Scrawny man.

631
00:21:48,569 --> 00:21:51,609
I told you not to take your shirt off.

632
00:21:51,610 --> 00:21:52,738
What?

633
00:21:52,739 --> 00:21:55,554
Hold on. Mina, excuse me,

634
00:21:55,680 --> 00:21:56,949
but aren't you of legal age now?

635
00:21:56,950 --> 00:21:59,419
Yes, I turned 21 this year.

636
00:21:59,420 --> 00:22:00,765
- She turned 21. - Oh, dear.

637
00:22:00,789 --> 00:22:03,248
- 21. - She's 21 already.

638
00:22:03,249 --> 00:22:06,394
You can drink beer now with your colleagues.

639
00:22:06,660 --> 00:22:08,829
(That's right.)

640
00:22:08,830 --> 00:22:10,189
- 21. - Goodness.

641
00:22:10,190 --> 00:22:11,958
That sounded like a morning talk show.

642
00:22:11,959 --> 00:22:13,905
(He got goosebumps.)

643
00:22:14,170 --> 00:22:16,604
What's the best thing about being an adult?

644
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:19,814
- Why are you having a conversation? - Let's talk about the top three.

645
00:22:20,709 --> 00:22:22,409
It's nice.

646
00:22:22,410 --> 00:22:24,485
It's great when you first become an adult.

647
00:22:24,610 --> 00:22:26,439
Is it that funny?

648
00:22:26,440 --> 00:22:28,485
(He gets mad all of a sudden.)

649
00:22:28,850 --> 00:22:30,748
- It's not that funny. - Why are you saying that to him?

650
00:22:30,749 --> 00:22:33,018
- Chi Yeul. - It totally suits you.

651
00:22:33,019 --> 00:22:35,119
- "Jee Seok Jin at the Fortress". - It's been a while.

652
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:37,018
I like that title.

653
00:22:37,019 --> 00:22:39,258
Next is Yu Na.

654
00:22:39,259 --> 00:22:40,558
(This is Yu Na's first time on Running Man.)

655
00:22:40,559 --> 00:22:42,735
- This is her first time. - Right.

656
00:22:42,930 --> 00:22:47,629
(She was a fake Harvard student on "Sky Castle".)

657
00:22:47,630 --> 00:22:50,839
(She's widening her spectrum as an actress with diverse roles.)

658
00:22:50,840 --> 00:22:53,544
You were Fake Harvard.

659
00:22:53,809 --> 00:22:57,639
You used to be an idol trainee, right?

660
00:22:57,640 --> 00:22:58,915
Yes.

661
00:22:58,940 --> 00:23:01,824
Yu Na, can we ask you for a dance?

662
00:23:02,309 --> 00:23:03,455
Yu Na.

663
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:05,225
Se Ri.

664
00:23:05,920 --> 00:23:07,079
This is hip-hop.

665
00:23:07,080 --> 00:23:08,564
(She enjoyed clubbing on "Sky Castle" as well.)

666
00:23:08,789 --> 00:23:11,294
- Bruno Mars. - She looks cool.

667
00:23:13,295 --> 00:23:16,995
<font color="#fcc89b">[VIU Ver] SBS E471 Running Man</font>

<font color="#ff5fa2">-♥ Ruo Xi ♥-</font>

668
00:23:18,160 --> 00:23:20,544
(She starts with sophisticated movements.)

669
00:23:20,670 --> 00:23:22,705
She's good. I knew it.

670
00:23:24,370 --> 00:23:25,975
She's playing with the beat.

671
00:23:26,170 --> 00:23:28,784
- She's good. - Her eyes changed.

672
00:23:30,910 --> 00:23:34,025
(Her father will approve of her dance skills.)

673
00:23:34,809 --> 00:23:36,579
- She looks relaxed. - I know.

674
00:23:36,580 --> 00:23:38,155
These are simple dance moves, but she makes it look good.

675
00:23:38,680 --> 00:23:40,018
She's good.

676
00:23:40,019 --> 00:23:43,195
(She has a great vibe.)

677
00:23:44,690 --> 00:23:46,288
You look arrogant.

678
00:23:46,289 --> 00:23:48,765
- You look more arrogant. - Se Ri!

679
00:23:49,229 --> 00:23:51,599
- Isn't she really good? - Se Ri.

680
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:53,558
- Se Ri. - Se Ri.

681
00:23:53,559 --> 00:23:54,705
(She's shy as soon as the music stops.)

682
00:23:55,900 --> 00:23:57,798
- That was awesome. - That was really good.

683
00:23:57,799 --> 00:23:58,869
- That was awesome. - Good job.

684
00:23:58,870 --> 00:24:01,185
- You were good. - That was amazing.

685
00:24:02,469 --> 00:24:05,185
- Goodness. - Amazing.

686
00:24:07,279 --> 00:24:08,755
She's good.

687
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:11,818
All right. Next is Tiffany. It's been a while.

688
00:24:11,819 --> 00:24:14,149
- Tiffany. - So nice to see you again.

689
00:24:14,150 --> 00:24:16,294
She has good news.

690
00:24:16,350 --> 00:24:18,788
You bought a house in America.

691
00:24:18,789 --> 00:24:20,988
(She bought a house in America.)

692
00:24:20,989 --> 00:24:24,175
- Yes. - Buying a house in America is...

693
00:24:24,229 --> 00:24:26,028
He said it was good news.

694
00:24:26,029 --> 00:24:29,268
I thought he was going to mention my new song.

695
00:24:29,269 --> 00:24:32,768
That too, but there's no better news than having your own house.

696
00:24:32,769 --> 00:24:34,508
That's true.

697
00:24:34,509 --> 00:24:36,738
- LA? - Yes, in LA.

698
00:24:36,739 --> 00:24:39,379
Haven't you seen Jong Kook in LA? He goes there often.

699
00:24:39,380 --> 00:24:41,849
We have a mutual friend.

700
00:24:41,850 --> 00:24:43,919
I know where you stay.

701
00:24:43,920 --> 00:24:45,818
- Where does he stay? - Is it somewhere weird?

702
00:24:45,819 --> 00:24:48,488
- No, it's not. - Don't talk about his daughter.

703
00:24:48,489 --> 00:24:49,689
(Be quiet.)

704
00:24:49,690 --> 00:24:50,758
(They're suspicious about his hidden daughter.)

705
00:24:50,759 --> 00:24:52,419
- His daughter? - We covered it up.

706
00:24:52,420 --> 00:24:54,189
- I don't have a daughter. - He doesn't.

707
00:24:54,190 --> 00:24:56,389
People think I really have one because of you.

708
00:24:56,390 --> 00:24:59,929
They're his close friends. He has many friends in the area.

709
00:24:59,930 --> 00:25:03,329
You bought a house in LA,

710
00:25:03,330 --> 00:25:04,968
and like we mentioned earlier...

711
00:25:04,969 --> 00:25:07,268
- On October 11. - You have a new song?

712
00:25:07,269 --> 00:25:08,339
- Yes. - "Run for You".

713
00:25:08,340 --> 00:25:12,255
- I didn't know. - I am touring 18 cities in America.

714
00:25:12,840 --> 00:25:15,379
- She performs in the US. - Global star.

715
00:25:15,380 --> 00:25:17,949
- 18? - Before I went on a bus tour,

716
00:25:17,950 --> 00:25:19,449
I wanted to say hi.

717
00:25:19,450 --> 00:25:21,018
What's a bus tour?

718
00:25:21,019 --> 00:25:24,689
You see it in the movies. For 4 to 6 weeks,

719
00:25:24,690 --> 00:25:25,919
- you travel by bus... - You complete the tour on a bus.

720
00:25:25,920 --> 00:25:28,028
to 18 cities.

721
00:25:28,029 --> 00:25:29,228
That's awesome.

722
00:25:29,229 --> 00:25:30,659
Can you sleep in it as well?

723
00:25:30,660 --> 00:25:32,958
Yes, during 4 to 6 weeks...

724
00:25:32,959 --> 00:25:36,099
Did you think it was like a bus we ride on?

725
00:25:36,100 --> 00:25:37,669
Like those seats.

726
00:25:37,670 --> 00:25:40,538
You can turn the seats around.

727
00:25:40,539 --> 00:25:42,839
- It's not like a bus we ride on. - "Let's get off."

728
00:25:42,840 --> 00:25:43,839
"Ring".

729
00:25:43,840 --> 00:25:45,079
It's not like that.

730
00:25:45,080 --> 00:25:47,579
Do the seats turn around to face other seats?

731
00:25:47,580 --> 00:25:49,824
- Next is Chi Yeul. - Chi Yeul.

732
00:25:49,850 --> 00:25:51,318
He's like family now.

733
00:25:51,319 --> 00:25:52,978
- Windmill brother. - It hasn't been that long.

734
00:25:52,979 --> 00:25:55,919
Chi Yeul is part of the Running Man family.

735
00:25:55,920 --> 00:25:56,988
Right.

736
00:25:56,989 --> 00:25:59,189
- So Min and I won last time. - Right.

737
00:25:59,190 --> 00:26:02,089
- You did the windmill too. - I took a gift set.

738
00:26:02,090 --> 00:26:04,899
- What was the gift? - It was an assorted gift set.

739
00:26:04,900 --> 00:26:06,475
(He doesn't remember.)

740
00:26:07,769 --> 00:26:10,129
- It was assorted. - Was it red ginseng?

741
00:26:10,130 --> 00:26:11,568
- It was nice. - It's the best.

742
00:26:11,569 --> 00:26:13,798
- It was nice. - Assorted gift sets are not bad.

743
00:26:13,799 --> 00:26:15,169
- Those are the best. - It's nice.

744
00:26:15,170 --> 00:26:19,238
Are you releasing a new song as well?

745
00:26:19,239 --> 00:26:22,284
I had a concert in Vancouver, Canada.

746
00:26:22,950 --> 00:26:24,818
You guys are all awesome.

747
00:26:24,819 --> 00:26:27,349
- That's so awesome. - You're awesome, Chi Yeul.

748
00:26:27,350 --> 00:26:30,988
Was the concert sold out in Vancouver?

749
00:26:30,989 --> 00:26:32,619
No, it wasn't sold out.

750
00:26:32,620 --> 00:26:34,458
(No, it wasn't sold out.)

751
00:26:34,459 --> 00:26:35,905
(I see.)

752
00:26:36,029 --> 00:26:38,758
I'm a solo singer, so my fans...

753
00:26:38,759 --> 00:26:40,528
- That's right. - He changed a lot.

754
00:26:40,529 --> 00:26:43,245
In the past, he would have said it was sold out.

755
00:26:43,430 --> 00:26:46,639
- You're very honest. - Yes.

756
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:49,839
Each team will have 3 people plus a guest. There will be 4 teams.

757
00:26:49,840 --> 00:26:52,978
There will be three rounds to obtain persimmon badges.

758
00:26:52,979 --> 00:26:56,478
At the end of the race, the team with the most badges win.

759
00:26:56,479 --> 00:26:58,548
A new font will be named after a Running Man member...

760
00:26:58,549 --> 00:27:00,478
with the most number of badges.

761
00:27:00,479 --> 00:27:04,119
If a guest has the most badges, they'll win the R ring.

762
00:27:04,120 --> 00:27:06,159
The team with the least number of badges...

763
00:27:06,160 --> 00:27:09,359
has to take off the tops of 100 persimmons and peel them.

764
00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:11,534
- Peel them? - There's a machine for them.

765
00:27:11,700 --> 00:27:13,228
We have to peel them?

766
00:27:13,229 --> 00:27:15,528
What if you don't know how to do it?

767
00:27:15,529 --> 00:27:17,344
We'll give you tools to work.

768
00:27:17,469 --> 00:27:20,175
- Better not come in last. - Let's make the teams.

769
00:27:20,239 --> 00:27:22,109
We'll play a very simple game.

770
00:27:22,110 --> 00:27:24,439
A guest will shout out initial consonants of a word,

771
00:27:24,440 --> 00:27:27,179
and if a Running Man member wants to be on that team,

772
00:27:27,180 --> 00:27:29,079
you can say the word and act it out.

773
00:27:29,080 --> 00:27:31,419
If the guest likes that member, they can approve.

774
00:27:31,420 --> 00:27:33,255
If they don't like the member, they can disapprove...

775
00:27:33,279 --> 00:27:34,894
and reject you.

776
00:27:34,989 --> 00:27:37,659
- Let's start with Chi Yeul. - Me?

777
00:27:37,660 --> 00:27:39,665
I'll go with an easy one.

778
00:27:39,959 --> 00:27:42,329
Bieup, giyok.

779
00:27:42,330 --> 00:27:43,859
- What? - Bieup, giyok.

780
00:27:43,860 --> 00:27:45,829
- Bieup, giyok? - Bieup, giyok.

781
00:27:45,830 --> 00:27:47,005
What is there?

782
00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:48,798
Fart.

783
00:27:48,799 --> 00:27:50,374
(He got one!)

784
00:27:51,269 --> 00:27:52,515
Fart.

785
00:27:54,340 --> 00:27:57,344
(On his first try?)

786
00:27:58,479 --> 00:27:59,909
- You're a team. - Did he recruit me?

787
00:27:59,910 --> 00:28:01,008
He got recruited?

788
00:28:01,009 --> 00:28:02,149
If he plays the bell once...

789
00:28:02,150 --> 00:28:03,949
(Kwang Soo and Chi Yeul are a couple.)

790
00:28:03,950 --> 00:28:05,478
- Is this over? - No,

791
00:28:05,479 --> 00:28:07,248
I didn't want to be on his team. I just remembered a word.

792
00:28:07,249 --> 00:28:08,589
- It's been decided. - Go ahead.

793
00:28:08,590 --> 00:28:11,718
If that's not a word you're thinking of, play the bell once.

794
00:28:11,719 --> 00:28:13,064
You got chosen.

795
00:28:13,259 --> 00:28:14,429
You're on Chi Yeul's team.

796
00:28:14,430 --> 00:28:15,629
Did you shout out a word without thinking?

797
00:28:15,630 --> 00:28:16,689
(There are three female guests.)

798
00:28:16,690 --> 00:28:18,998
It's not about any random word. This is not how it goes!

799
00:28:18,999 --> 00:28:20,929
- Good. - Kwang Soo.

800
00:28:20,930 --> 00:28:22,068
We got rid of Kwang Soo. Go ahead.

801
00:28:22,069 --> 00:28:25,114
Chi Yeul, don't even think about winning today.

802
00:28:25,340 --> 00:28:26,768
It's okay.

803
00:28:26,769 --> 00:28:28,339
I like him.

804
00:28:28,340 --> 00:28:29,968
Tiffany is next.

805
00:28:29,969 --> 00:28:31,584
Fany, Tiffany.

806
00:28:31,840 --> 00:28:34,478
Bieup, siot.

807
00:28:34,479 --> 00:28:35,748
- Bieup, siot? - What's that?

808
00:28:35,749 --> 00:28:37,818
Goodness, you should do this one.

809
00:28:37,819 --> 00:28:38,949
- You do it. You're good at this. - Goodness.

810
00:28:38,950 --> 00:28:40,318
- What is it? - You're good.

811
00:28:40,319 --> 00:28:41,824
I don't know.

812
00:28:42,420 --> 00:28:43,689
That's the only word I can think of.

813
00:28:43,690 --> 00:28:44,718
Me too.

814
00:28:44,719 --> 00:28:45,758
(It's a strong word they can't help but think of.)

815
00:28:45,759 --> 00:28:46,788
Goodness.

816
00:28:46,789 --> 00:28:48,389
I'm not thinking what you're thinking.

817
00:28:48,390 --> 00:28:50,258
There are many words. What are you thinking of?

818
00:28:50,259 --> 00:28:51,359
Clapping.

819
00:28:51,360 --> 00:28:52,498
There's "clapping".

820
00:28:52,499 --> 00:28:53,675
Clapping.

821
00:28:55,029 --> 00:28:56,968
(Did she get it in one try?)

822
00:28:56,969 --> 00:28:58,998
She got it? Is it an easy pass every time?

823
00:28:58,999 --> 00:29:00,068
Clapping?

824
00:29:00,069 --> 00:29:01,738
They're not rejecting anybody.

825
00:29:01,739 --> 00:29:03,044
I'm happy, Ji Hyo.

826
00:29:03,110 --> 00:29:04,409
Tiffany.

827
00:29:04,410 --> 00:29:05,579
Let's win today.

828
00:29:05,580 --> 00:29:06,978
- It's Mina. - Mina.

829
00:29:06,979 --> 00:29:08,008
(It's Mina's turn.)

830
00:29:08,009 --> 00:29:09,725
Mieum, chieut.

831
00:29:09,749 --> 00:29:10,894
Mieum, chieut?

832
00:29:11,120 --> 00:29:12,619
- Mieum, chieut? - Mieum and chieut.

833
00:29:12,620 --> 00:29:14,349
Macho!

834
00:29:14,350 --> 00:29:15,995
(I got it!)

835
00:29:16,450 --> 00:29:18,165
(The first rejection)

836
00:29:18,390 --> 00:29:19,518
She says you're wrong.

837
00:29:19,519 --> 00:29:20,659
(I thought everyone got an easy pass.)

838
00:29:20,660 --> 00:29:21,765
But macho makes sense.

839
00:29:22,130 --> 00:29:23,228
Hold on.

840
00:29:23,229 --> 00:29:24,735
(The judges raise their standards for Seok Jin.)

841
00:29:25,130 --> 00:29:27,099
I got it. The pit of the stomach.

842
00:29:27,100 --> 00:29:28,445
(He pulls up his shirt.)

843
00:29:28,900 --> 00:29:30,044
The pit of the stomach.

844
00:29:30,499 --> 00:29:32,015
Are you kidding me?

845
00:29:32,340 --> 00:29:34,068
What? That made sense!

846
00:29:34,069 --> 00:29:35,909
- Why pull up your shirt? - Gosh.

847
00:29:35,910 --> 00:29:37,339
The pit of the stomach.

848
00:29:37,340 --> 00:29:39,515
(It's as if they've been struck in the pit of the stomach.)

849
00:29:40,309 --> 00:29:41,485
I got it.

850
00:29:41,580 --> 00:29:42,849
Anchovy!

851
00:29:42,850 --> 00:29:44,624
(Anchovy!)

852
00:29:45,350 --> 00:29:48,318
(So Min sells an anchovy and joins Team Mina.)

853
00:29:48,319 --> 00:29:49,665
You're accepting "anchovy"?

854
00:29:50,620 --> 00:29:52,018
Anchovy.

855
00:29:52,019 --> 00:29:53,518
"The pit of the stomach" is better.

856
00:29:53,519 --> 00:29:55,089
Yu Na's next.

857
00:29:55,090 --> 00:29:56,228
(Lastly, it's Yu Na.)

858
00:29:56,229 --> 00:29:57,728
Giyok, jieut.

859
00:29:57,729 --> 00:29:59,505
- Giyok, jieut? - Giyok, jieut.

860
00:29:59,830 --> 00:30:01,399
I got it. Stiff.

861
00:30:01,400 --> 00:30:03,228
(Stiff)

862
00:30:03,229 --> 00:30:04,238
(That was clever.)

863
00:30:04,239 --> 00:30:05,515
That was witty of him.

864
00:30:05,799 --> 00:30:07,245
You have to accept that.

865
00:30:07,469 --> 00:30:08,584
Okay!

866
00:30:10,469 --> 00:30:12,439
Why can't I think of anything?

867
00:30:12,440 --> 00:30:13,639
I didn't say anything on purpose.

868
00:30:13,640 --> 00:30:15,308
- It's our turn to choose. - The tables have turned.

869
00:30:15,309 --> 00:30:16,909
Please give them the xylophones.

870
00:30:16,910 --> 00:30:17,995
Hand them over.

871
00:30:18,219 --> 00:30:19,818
Only those picky are left.

872
00:30:19,819 --> 00:30:20,965
Nice.

873
00:30:21,719 --> 00:30:24,364
You're right about them all being difficult.

874
00:30:24,489 --> 00:30:25,818
I'm already suffocating.

875
00:30:25,819 --> 00:30:27,765
They all do as they please.

876
00:30:27,930 --> 00:30:28,929
The stubborn ones.

877
00:30:28,930 --> 00:30:31,034
- Are you ready? - Yes.

878
00:30:31,830 --> 00:30:33,329
- Giyok, nieun. - Sorry?

879
00:30:33,330 --> 00:30:34,498
Giyok, nieun.

880
00:30:34,499 --> 00:30:35,669
(Jae Seok's consonants: Giyok, nieun)

881
00:30:35,670 --> 00:30:37,044
(Me!)

882
00:30:38,069 --> 00:30:39,245
Agony.

883
00:30:39,269 --> 00:30:40,675
(Incorrect)

884
00:30:41,640 --> 00:30:43,245
(He's strict.)

885
00:30:45,610 --> 00:30:46,609
Giyok, nieun?

886
00:30:46,610 --> 00:30:47,884
(Before Kwang Soo even does anything)

887
00:30:49,450 --> 00:30:51,255
What? Hold on.

888
00:30:51,420 --> 00:30:52,919
Why? He didn't even do anything.

889
00:30:52,920 --> 00:30:54,349
- Jae Seok! - What?

890
00:30:54,350 --> 00:30:56,695
Go. He doesn't want you on his team.

891
00:30:57,219 --> 00:30:59,389
(I don't want to be on that team.)

892
00:30:59,390 --> 00:31:00,634
What?

893
00:31:00,819 --> 00:31:01,929
- Get back in line. - What was it?

894
00:31:01,930 --> 00:31:03,089
Well...

895
00:31:03,090 --> 00:31:04,929
- Everyone gets one chance. - Okay.

896
00:31:04,930 --> 00:31:06,228
Giyok, rieul.

897
00:31:06,229 --> 00:31:10,475
(Seok Jin's consonants: Giyok, rieul)

898
00:31:15,110 --> 00:31:16,784
Will no one come forward?

899
00:31:17,269 --> 00:31:19,639
- You have five seconds. - It's a difficult combination.

900
00:31:19,640 --> 00:31:20,738
- Giyok, rieul. - Three...

901
00:31:20,739 --> 00:31:23,255
The combination is a tricky one.

902
00:31:23,410 --> 00:31:25,218
- What... - I can't think of anything.

903
00:31:25,219 --> 00:31:27,018
- What can it be? - Please remember me, guys.

904
00:31:27,019 --> 00:31:28,488
- I don't know. - Let's move on.

905
00:31:28,489 --> 00:31:29,695
Jong Kook's next.

906
00:31:30,749 --> 00:31:32,818
- I'm sure you can think of one. - Jong Kook?

907
00:31:32,819 --> 00:31:35,534
- I'll get back to you guys. - Joon Kook, you're next.

908
00:31:35,759 --> 00:31:38,034
Guys, it's time to put your brains to work.

909
00:31:38,400 --> 00:31:40,205
- What? - Ieung,

910
00:31:40,729 --> 00:31:42,699
- giyok. - Ieung, giyok.

911
00:31:42,700 --> 00:31:44,169
(Jong Kook's consonants: Ieung, giyok)

912
00:31:44,170 --> 00:31:46,268
(Crying like a baby)

913
00:31:46,269 --> 00:31:47,909
- A baby. - A baby.

914
00:31:47,910 --> 00:31:49,738
(He hates it when people act cute.)

915
00:31:49,739 --> 00:31:50,844
A baby.

916
00:31:50,910 --> 00:31:53,155
- Yu Na's got it. - Yu Na's up.

917
00:31:53,880 --> 00:31:54,909
Poop.

918
00:31:54,910 --> 00:31:56,579
(Very simple)

919
00:31:56,580 --> 00:31:58,018
- What? - It's a good one.

920
00:31:58,019 --> 00:32:00,079
- Just like that? - Okay.

921
00:32:00,080 --> 00:32:01,725
(That was good enough?)

922
00:32:02,350 --> 00:32:03,748
Wasn't "baby" a good answer?

923
00:32:03,749 --> 00:32:05,189
How is that a good one?

924
00:32:05,190 --> 00:32:08,488
- It was good. - No, I liked Yu Na's.

925
00:32:08,489 --> 00:32:10,534
- Jong Kook's on our team. - Do I join them?

926
00:32:11,029 --> 00:32:12,859
Bieup, giyok.

927
00:32:12,860 --> 00:32:13,859
(Haha's consonants: Bieup, giyok)

928
00:32:13,860 --> 00:32:15,099
Bieup...

929
00:32:15,100 --> 00:32:16,268
(Haha's consonants: Bieup, giyok)

930
00:32:16,269 --> 00:32:17,405
Wait, I know.

931
00:32:18,200 --> 00:32:20,245
(Guns blaring)

932
00:32:20,569 --> 00:32:21,685
More intensely!

933
00:32:22,469 --> 00:32:24,784
- What is this? - Yes, exactly.

934
00:32:24,940 --> 00:32:26,685
(Are they in a battle?)

935
00:32:27,580 --> 00:32:29,284
Mina, shoot me.

936
00:32:29,580 --> 00:32:31,054
- What? - What is this?

937
00:32:31,479 --> 00:32:32,478
"Battlegrounds."

938
00:32:32,479 --> 00:32:34,119
(An online shooting game, "Battlegrounds")

939
00:32:34,120 --> 00:32:35,548
"Battlegrounds"?

940
00:32:35,549 --> 00:32:36,818
"Battlegrounds"...

941
00:32:36,819 --> 00:32:39,488
No can do. I don't even have an account.

942
00:32:39,489 --> 00:32:40,859
He doesn't play that game.

943
00:32:40,860 --> 00:32:42,359
Why won't you accept it?

944
00:32:42,360 --> 00:32:43,558
Haha, come on.

945
00:32:43,559 --> 00:32:46,599
He's 40 and old, so he doesn't know that game.

946
00:32:46,600 --> 00:32:47,728
He doesn't know "Battlegrounds".

947
00:32:47,729 --> 00:32:49,968
- Okay, I accept. - He accepts it.

948
00:32:49,969 --> 00:32:52,544
(Haha accepts "Battlegrounds" and joins Team Mina)

949
00:32:52,739 --> 00:32:55,114
- All right. - You're running out of chances.

950
00:32:55,370 --> 00:32:57,515
There are only two teams left...

951
00:32:57,640 --> 00:32:59,109
and one should take me.

952
00:32:59,110 --> 00:33:00,685
- Right. - All right.

953
00:33:00,739 --> 00:33:02,425
If not, you'll end up with me.

954
00:33:02,580 --> 00:33:04,725
- Giyok, giyok. - Giyok, giyok.

955
00:33:04,819 --> 00:33:06,955
- Giyok, giyok? - Giyok, giyok?

956
00:33:08,219 --> 00:33:10,094
(Coughing)

957
00:33:11,120 --> 00:33:12,518
- What are you doing? - What's that?

958
00:33:12,519 --> 00:33:13,935
Is this for real or not?

959
00:33:14,830 --> 00:33:15,829
A cold.

960
00:33:15,830 --> 00:33:16,829
(A cold.)

961
00:33:16,830 --> 00:33:18,359
(It's not bad...)

962
00:33:18,360 --> 00:33:19,528
You fooled all of us.

963
00:33:19,529 --> 00:33:21,329
- Meat! - We fell for it.

964
00:33:21,330 --> 00:33:22,599
- A cold. - Are you kidding me?

965
00:33:22,600 --> 00:33:24,599
- I'm not sure. - Tell me about it.

966
00:33:24,600 --> 00:33:26,399
- They're both a little weak. - I know.

967
00:33:26,400 --> 00:33:28,784
(Yelling)

968
00:33:29,039 --> 00:33:30,109
Madness.

969
00:33:30,110 --> 00:33:31,185
(Madness)

970
00:33:31,380 --> 00:33:32,485
Nice!

971
00:33:32,979 --> 00:33:36,308
- Okay. - Give Seok Jin a chance too.

972
00:33:36,309 --> 00:33:38,119
- It's all right. - I just ended it.

973
00:33:38,120 --> 00:33:39,594
It's fine.

974
00:33:40,120 --> 00:33:43,389
You'll get changed and begin the race then.

975
00:33:43,390 --> 00:33:44,518
- Please get changed. - Okay.

976
00:33:44,519 --> 00:33:45,665
(The teams)

977
00:33:45,959 --> 00:33:47,829
(Their first mission takes place at Cheongdo Fortress.)

978
00:33:47,830 --> 00:33:49,564
Check out the view.

979
00:33:49,930 --> 00:33:51,298
Our team though...

980
00:33:51,299 --> 00:33:52,374
What's wrong?

981
00:33:52,400 --> 00:33:53,558
I hate this.

982
00:33:53,559 --> 00:33:55,445
- Why? - I love our team.

983
00:33:55,670 --> 00:33:56,998
You guys look great together.

984
00:33:56,999 --> 00:33:58,699
- You do. - Really?

985
00:33:58,700 --> 00:33:59,699
That color suits you as well.

986
00:33:59,700 --> 00:34:01,208
- Even your caps are the same color. - It's perfect.

987
00:34:01,209 --> 00:34:03,068
We thought that we made a great team.

988
00:34:03,069 --> 00:34:04,538
- We'll win for sure today. - Of course.

989
00:34:04,539 --> 00:34:07,755
It's funny how the teams give off different vibes.

990
00:34:07,850 --> 00:34:09,579
Team Yu Na...

991
00:34:09,580 --> 00:34:12,919
looks as if a distant niece of Jong Kook's...

992
00:34:12,920 --> 00:34:16,289
who he doesn't even remember...

993
00:34:16,290 --> 00:34:18,389
came to the broadcasting station with him.

994
00:34:18,390 --> 00:34:20,519
To remedy the awkwardness, he called Se Chan.

995
00:34:20,520 --> 00:34:21,858
Yes, to keep things fun.

996
00:34:21,859 --> 00:34:23,128
- That's how it feels. - "Yu Na, are you having fun?"

997
00:34:23,129 --> 00:34:24,429
I always ask friends over when things get awkward.

998
00:34:24,430 --> 00:34:25,929
Right? That's how you are.

999
00:34:25,930 --> 00:34:28,005
Well, that's how it feels. Meanwhile...

1000
00:34:28,129 --> 00:34:29,468
This is the team that'll peel persimmons.

1001
00:34:29,469 --> 00:34:31,615
(The team that'll peel persimmons)

1002
00:34:32,700 --> 00:34:34,909
- They must, right? - I'm getting that vibe too.

1003
00:34:34,910 --> 00:34:36,338
We don't have any advantage.

1004
00:34:36,339 --> 00:34:38,255
I can already smell the persimmons on my hands.

1005
00:34:38,910 --> 00:34:41,209
- It's driving me crazy. - Persimmons have a strong smell.

1006
00:34:41,210 --> 00:34:42,525
What about us then?

1007
00:34:43,109 --> 00:34:45,255
- We... - The tall one,

1008
00:34:45,279 --> 00:34:47,119
- the fool, and... - The three losers.

1009
00:34:47,120 --> 00:34:48,749
That's what you are. The three losers.

1010
00:34:48,750 --> 00:34:50,849
(Losers?)

1011
00:34:50,850 --> 00:34:53,188
How can you call us losers?

1012
00:34:53,189 --> 00:34:55,088
The tall one and the fool?

1013
00:34:55,089 --> 00:34:57,628
- The tall one and the fool? - That's what she said.

1014
00:34:57,629 --> 00:34:58,999
- Together, we're the losers. - No way.

1015
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:02,769
The first game is Find the Word.

1016
00:35:02,770 --> 00:35:03,929
Find the Word?

1017
00:35:03,930 --> 00:35:05,269
One member from each team...

1018
00:35:05,270 --> 00:35:08,769
will randomly open the dictionary and choose a word.

1019
00:35:08,770 --> 00:35:10,468
The entire team will then...

1020
00:35:10,469 --> 00:35:13,008
try and locate the word within the area. The first team back wins.

1021
00:35:13,009 --> 00:35:14,184
Are you ready?

1022
00:35:14,210 --> 00:35:16,579
All right. Ready, set...

1023
00:35:16,580 --> 00:35:18,749
(It's important to open to a page where there are many common words.)

1024
00:35:18,750 --> 00:35:19,854
Go!

1025
00:35:20,219 --> 00:35:21,718
- Look. - There's "dog."

1026
00:35:21,719 --> 00:35:23,818
- Dog. - Yes, dog.

1027
00:35:23,819 --> 00:35:26,019
There's "dog."

1028
00:35:26,020 --> 00:35:27,289
(Let's find a dog!)

1029
00:35:27,290 --> 00:35:28,488
- A dog? - You'll bring a puppy?

1030
00:35:28,489 --> 00:35:30,088
A dog won't be easy.

1031
00:35:30,089 --> 00:35:32,028
You can't bring a puppy. It has to be a dog.

1032
00:35:32,029 --> 00:35:33,659
The two are different.

1033
00:35:33,660 --> 00:35:34,929
Right, they're different.

1034
00:35:34,930 --> 00:35:36,829
Over here, buddy. Good job.

1035
00:35:36,830 --> 00:35:38,999
That's it. Come on.

1036
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:41,168
Over here. Good dog.

1037
00:35:41,169 --> 00:35:43,709
They actually brought a dog.

1038
00:35:43,710 --> 00:35:45,278
- Come on. - It's an actual dog.

1039
00:35:45,279 --> 00:35:46,738
It's a real dog.

1040
00:35:46,739 --> 00:35:48,349
- Over here. - Come on.

1041
00:35:48,350 --> 00:35:49,409
It's a dog.

1042
00:35:49,410 --> 00:35:51,278
- Here it comes. - They found an actual dog?

1043
00:35:51,279 --> 00:35:53,195
They brought a real dog.

1044
00:35:53,279 --> 00:35:54,318
That was fast.

1045
00:35:54,319 --> 00:35:55,588
I found "car."

1046
00:35:55,589 --> 00:35:57,488
- How can we bring a car? - Right?

1047
00:35:57,489 --> 00:35:59,418
How are you going to bring a car?

1048
00:35:59,419 --> 00:36:00,735
- A car? - Hey!

1049
00:36:00,989 --> 00:36:04,628
They can have my respect if they manage to bring a car here.

1050
00:36:04,629 --> 00:36:05,729
(Fools...)

1051
00:36:05,730 --> 00:36:07,229
- Wait, it made a right turn. - Here it comes.

1052
00:36:07,230 --> 00:36:10,269
- That's what they're in? - Here comes a car.

1053
00:36:10,270 --> 00:36:11,874
(Here comes a car.)

1054
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:13,914
- A car? - It's a real car.

1055
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:16,615
- Here comes a car. - I salute them.

1056
00:36:16,810 --> 00:36:17,909
Sir!

1057
00:36:17,910 --> 00:36:19,579
(They received help from a nearby citizen.)

1058
00:36:19,580 --> 00:36:22,008
Sir, could you briefly give us a ride?

1059
00:36:22,009 --> 00:36:24,624
They brought a dog and a car.

1060
00:36:24,750 --> 00:36:26,479
They're bringing the big guns.

1061
00:36:26,480 --> 00:36:28,624
(Imposing)

1062
00:36:29,719 --> 00:36:31,818
(They brought a car right in front of the director.)

1063
00:36:31,819 --> 00:36:32,818
This definitely counts.

1064
00:36:32,819 --> 00:36:34,595
- I agree. - Me too.

1065
00:36:34,960 --> 00:36:36,434
This is hilarious.

1066
00:36:36,629 --> 00:36:38,559
- Look. - See?

1067
00:36:38,560 --> 00:36:40,858
- Nice. - This round is ours.

1068
00:36:40,859 --> 00:36:41,945
(Team Tiffany is in 1st place.)

1069
00:36:42,500 --> 00:36:43,729
Thread.

1070
00:36:43,730 --> 00:36:46,568
A short thread. Let's look for that.

1071
00:36:46,569 --> 00:36:48,108
- A thread? - It's on our clothes.

1072
00:36:48,109 --> 00:36:49,738
- A thread. - Right.

1073
00:36:49,739 --> 00:36:52,008
- An undershirt. - An undershirt.

1074
00:36:52,009 --> 00:36:53,555
An undershirt?

1075
00:36:53,609 --> 00:36:54,785
Hold on.

1076
00:36:54,850 --> 00:36:56,378
- Come with us. - Take him with us.

1077
00:36:56,379 --> 00:36:57,849
- What? - A thread.

1078
00:36:57,850 --> 00:36:59,449
- Wait... - Here it is!

1079
00:36:59,450 --> 00:37:00,849
- Here. - A thread.

1080
00:37:00,850 --> 00:37:02,918
Look, he's wearing an undershirt.

1081
00:37:02,919 --> 00:37:04,858
Where? Okay, take it off him.

1082
00:37:04,859 --> 00:37:06,818
Why? What's going on?

1083
00:37:06,819 --> 00:37:08,235
- Hurry. - Why?

1084
00:37:08,359 --> 00:37:09,505
What are you doing?

1085
00:37:09,930 --> 00:37:11,599
- Guys! - Hold on.

1086
00:37:11,600 --> 00:37:12,834
What is this?

1087
00:37:14,230 --> 00:37:15,704
(What are you doing?)

1088
00:37:16,129 --> 00:37:17,244
(Smooth)

1089
00:37:17,669 --> 00:37:19,945
Why are you doing this to me?

1090
00:37:20,069 --> 00:37:21,639
- Hey! - An undershirt.

1091
00:37:21,640 --> 00:37:23,108
Here's an undershirt.

1092
00:37:23,109 --> 00:37:25,514
- It's an undershirt. - What is this?

1093
00:37:26,310 --> 00:37:27,378
My gosh.

1094
00:37:27,379 --> 00:37:29,108
- Good job. - Here you go.

1095
00:37:29,109 --> 00:37:30,608
Goodness.

1096
00:37:30,609 --> 00:37:32,648
We have his undershirt.

1097
00:37:32,649 --> 00:37:34,624
Kwang Soo, here you go.

1098
00:37:34,750 --> 00:37:36,088
- A thread. - It's on his sweatshirt.

1099
00:37:36,089 --> 00:37:37,088
- I accept that. - Yes!

1100
00:37:37,089 --> 00:37:38,188
Again?

1101
00:37:38,189 --> 00:37:39,318
(He enters a coffee shop to find a charger.)

1102
00:37:39,319 --> 00:37:41,019
- Hello. - Hello.

1103
00:37:41,020 --> 00:37:42,628
Could we perhaps borrow a charger?

1104
00:37:42,629 --> 00:37:43,988
A charger.

1105
00:37:43,989 --> 00:37:45,128
Your phone would be nice too.

1106
00:37:45,129 --> 00:37:46,229
Thank you.

1107
00:37:46,230 --> 00:37:47,929
- We'll bring it back shortly. - It won't be long.

1108
00:37:47,930 --> 00:37:49,568
- This will put us in the lead. - It's over now.

1109
00:37:49,569 --> 00:37:50,599
That's what we need?

1110
00:37:50,600 --> 00:37:51,744
We won.

1111
00:37:51,770 --> 00:37:52,999
- I accept. - Okay!

1112
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:54,099
Are we good?

1113
00:37:54,100 --> 00:37:55,438
They're done then.

1114
00:37:55,439 --> 00:37:56,709
- Are you done? - We're good.

1115
00:37:56,710 --> 00:37:58,885
- You're done? - We're done.

1116
00:37:59,540 --> 00:38:01,179
Are we in last place then?

1117
00:38:01,180 --> 00:38:02,479
Nice!

1118
00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:04,918
(Except for the team in last place, the three play for the badges.)

1119
00:38:04,919 --> 00:38:06,918
(Current Number of Persimmon Badges)

1120
00:38:06,919 --> 00:38:08,894
(Team Yu Na, Team Tiffany, Team Chi Yeul, Team, Mina)

1121
00:38:08,919 --> 00:38:10,519
Three Losers.

1122
00:38:10,520 --> 00:38:11,818
I like the nickname.

1123
00:38:11,819 --> 00:38:13,865
- Three Losers. - There it is.

1124
00:38:14,290 --> 00:38:15,505
I always say this,

1125
00:38:15,560 --> 00:38:18,858
but one day, someone we wave to today...

1126
00:38:18,859 --> 00:38:21,999
will come up to us and say that they were here...

1127
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:23,628
- after becoming a celebrity. - You're right.

1128
00:38:23,629 --> 00:38:24,628
That's true.

1129
00:38:24,629 --> 00:38:27,269
You all know Son Yeon Jae, right?

1130
00:38:27,270 --> 00:38:28,909
- When she was young... - Son Yeon Jae?

1131
00:38:28,910 --> 00:38:30,709
She wanted my autograph, so I signed her one.

1132
00:38:30,710 --> 00:38:31,738
That's right.

1133
00:38:31,739 --> 00:38:35,849
- He told her to go first though. - So she came back with her friends.

1134
00:38:35,850 --> 00:38:38,084
- And that was Yeon Jae? - So I told her to go away.

1135
00:38:38,419 --> 00:38:40,155
That girl became the Son Yeon Jae we know.

1136
00:38:40,180 --> 00:38:42,019
It really happens. Yu Na...

1137
00:38:42,020 --> 00:38:43,188
- It happened to me too. - Right?

1138
00:38:43,189 --> 00:38:44,718
- So... - Who was it for you?

1139
00:38:44,719 --> 00:38:47,358
I took a photo with you in middle school.

1140
00:38:47,359 --> 00:38:48,389
What?

1141
00:38:48,390 --> 00:38:51,128
You were filming an episode of Running Man.

1142
00:38:51,129 --> 00:38:52,499
What did I tell you?

1143
00:38:52,500 --> 00:38:53,758
- No way. - These things happen.

1144
00:38:53,759 --> 00:38:56,499
Why did you take one with him of all people?

1145
00:38:56,500 --> 00:38:57,599
I'm a fan.

1146
00:38:57,600 --> 00:38:59,298
- Of his? - Yu Na, where was it?

1147
00:38:59,299 --> 00:39:01,215
- Where did we take it? - At Dongdaemun.

1148
00:39:01,339 --> 00:39:03,709
- Dongdaemun? - Which episode was it?

1149
00:39:03,710 --> 00:39:05,179
It's been so long.

1150
00:39:05,180 --> 00:39:06,838
Jackie Chan was a guest.

1151
00:39:06,839 --> 00:39:08,008
- What? - Jackie Chan was with you.

1152
00:39:08,009 --> 00:39:09,249
It could happen, right?

1153
00:39:09,250 --> 00:39:11,025
I'm a fan.

1154
00:39:11,649 --> 00:39:13,449
(6 years ago in Dongdaemun,)

1155
00:39:13,450 --> 00:39:15,425
(Running Man was running around as usual.)

1156
00:39:16,819 --> 00:39:22,064
(The guest was Jackie Chan, and Yu Na was there too.)

1157
00:39:24,029 --> 00:39:25,405
- Were you there? - That's unbelievable.

1158
00:39:26,200 --> 00:39:28,229
- That's crazy. - Seriously.

1159
00:39:28,230 --> 00:39:30,298
And today,

1160
00:39:30,299 --> 00:39:32,168
- Yu Na is here on Running Man. - Exactly.

1161
00:39:32,169 --> 00:39:33,845
Give her a big hand!

1162
00:39:34,600 --> 00:39:36,568
- That's beautiful. - Her dream came true.

1163
00:39:36,569 --> 00:39:39,338
This happens sometimes.

1164
00:39:39,339 --> 00:39:40,979
- That's incredible. - Really.

1165
00:39:40,980 --> 00:39:43,508
When Jae Seok had just debuted,

1166
00:39:43,509 --> 00:39:45,894
some people were getting his autograph.

1167
00:39:45,950 --> 00:39:47,925
And Shim Sin passed by.

1168
00:39:47,980 --> 00:39:49,418
Jae Seok was giving his autograph,

1169
00:39:49,419 --> 00:39:52,889
and the people took the paper away from him.

1170
00:39:52,890 --> 00:39:53,918
(Jae Seok remembers that day.)

1171
00:39:53,919 --> 00:39:55,858
- Jae Seok was willing to sign... - I wanted to give it,

1172
00:39:55,859 --> 00:39:57,564
but they took the paper away.

1173
00:39:57,790 --> 00:39:59,805
When that happens,

1174
00:39:59,859 --> 00:40:00,898
- it hurts. - That's sad.

1175
00:40:00,899 --> 00:40:02,329
"Give me the paper. I'm almost done."

1176
00:40:02,330 --> 00:40:03,644
"Just give it to me."

1177
00:40:04,839 --> 00:40:05,898
That's so sad.

1178
00:40:05,899 --> 00:40:07,238
(It's when he was an unknown grasshopper.)

1179
00:40:07,239 --> 00:40:10,414
Back then, you didn't look so good.

1180
00:40:10,739 --> 00:40:13,209
Looking back, my looks weren't the problem.

1181
00:40:13,210 --> 00:40:14,338
My skills weren't good either.

1182
00:40:14,339 --> 00:40:15,349
(He reflects on himself.)

1183
00:40:15,350 --> 00:40:17,608
- As a host... - You were nervous.

1184
00:40:17,609 --> 00:40:20,318
I didn't know how to smooth things out.

1185
00:40:20,319 --> 00:40:22,494
- I want to know when that was. - I think we're here.

1186
00:40:22,750 --> 00:40:24,164
(They arrive at the second mission.)

1187
00:40:24,419 --> 00:40:26,258
- It's really big. - It's huge.

1188
00:40:26,259 --> 00:40:27,434
That's Haha.

1189
00:40:27,620 --> 00:40:29,128
- That's Haha. - It looks just like him.

1190
00:40:29,129 --> 00:40:30,628
That's Haha, and that's Seok Jin.

1191
00:40:30,629 --> 00:40:32,405
- It looks exactly like him. - They look like them.

1192
00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:36,275
- It really looks like me. - This is Haha.

1193
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:38,675
Over here. Exactly.

1194
00:40:39,770 --> 00:40:44,244
In the second mission, you can earn persimmon badges...

1195
00:40:44,540 --> 00:40:46,079
by singing.

1196
00:40:46,080 --> 00:40:48,479
- It's the Korean Song Contest. - Korean Song Contest?

1197
00:40:48,480 --> 00:40:50,278
- We have Mina. - Mina is a good singer, right?

1198
00:40:50,279 --> 00:40:51,525
English probably isn't allowed.

1199
00:40:51,850 --> 00:40:55,188
Out of the four songs prepared by the production team,

1200
00:40:55,189 --> 00:40:57,088
one song will be randomly picked.

1201
00:40:57,089 --> 00:41:00,289
You have to change any foreign lyrics to Korean.

1202
00:41:00,290 --> 00:41:02,229
The team with the lowest score loses.

1203
00:41:02,230 --> 00:41:04,159
- You need to know English. - Chi Yeul...

1204
00:41:04,160 --> 00:41:05,974
I have no chance at this.

1205
00:41:06,460 --> 00:41:07,929
I could change the lyrics, but...

1206
00:41:07,930 --> 00:41:10,898
Each time you fail to change foreign words to Korean,

1207
00:41:10,899 --> 00:41:14,298
- you lose five points. - Tiffany has an advantage.

1208
00:41:14,299 --> 00:41:16,108
- Tiffany will be good at it. - We have Tiffany.

1209
00:41:16,109 --> 00:41:18,979
- She'll be able to translate. - But it'll come up suddenly.

1210
00:41:18,980 --> 00:41:21,709
Se Chan, you can't translate English into Korean.

1211
00:41:21,710 --> 00:41:22,849
- What? - Can you?

1212
00:41:22,850 --> 00:41:25,179
But I know all the famous songs.

1213
00:41:25,180 --> 00:41:27,025
You'll have to translate things like "cheer up" into Korean.

1214
00:41:27,049 --> 00:41:29,789
You can look up the lyrics for 30 seconds before you start singing.

1215
00:41:29,790 --> 00:41:31,735
Seok Jin hadn't talked in a long time.

1216
00:41:32,060 --> 00:41:33,389
Why did you have to cut in?

1217
00:41:33,390 --> 00:41:35,159
- Why did you do that? - Why?

1218
00:41:35,160 --> 00:41:37,005
- I was talking. - I mean...

1219
00:41:37,029 --> 00:41:38,204
I'm sorry.

1220
00:41:38,500 --> 00:41:39,758
I'm so sorry.

1221
00:41:39,759 --> 00:41:41,459
- I wanted to speed things up. - Seok Jin is going to...

1222
00:41:41,460 --> 00:41:42,999
text me later.

1223
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:44,269
- What is he going to say? - "What do you think..."

1224
00:41:44,270 --> 00:41:47,414
"was Chul Min's intention?"

1225
00:41:48,810 --> 00:41:51,814
Chul Min made it clear that he was going to edit it out.

1226
00:41:51,910 --> 00:41:53,139
Don't do that.

1227
00:41:53,140 --> 00:41:54,755
You got the wrong idea.

1228
00:41:55,310 --> 00:41:57,454
This is so funny.

1229
00:41:57,649 --> 00:41:59,718
After looking up the lyrics for 30 seconds,

1230
00:41:59,719 --> 00:42:01,218
you'll start singing.

1231
00:42:01,219 --> 00:42:02,218
We can look up the lyrics?

1232
00:42:02,219 --> 00:42:04,218
Because you don't know how much of the lyrics are in English...

1233
00:42:04,219 --> 00:42:05,564
Let's decide the order.

1234
00:42:05,989 --> 00:42:07,834
Pick 1 from these 4 songs.

1235
00:42:08,120 --> 00:42:09,389
Pick one and show it to the camera.

1236
00:42:09,390 --> 00:42:11,564
- Mina is a good singer. - Please!

1237
00:42:12,359 --> 00:42:14,374
That team has Tiffany.

1238
00:42:15,029 --> 00:42:16,244
What happened?

1239
00:42:17,870 --> 00:42:20,168
(Mina's song is "Pick Me" by I.O.I.)

1240
00:42:20,169 --> 00:42:21,514
"Pick Me" by I.O.I!

1241
00:42:23,210 --> 00:42:25,785
("Pick Me" is I.O.I's most famous song.)

1242
00:42:26,239 --> 00:42:29,124
(Including the title, the song has many English words.)

1243
00:42:29,710 --> 00:42:33,019
(Will she be able to change all the English words to Korean?)

1244
00:42:33,020 --> 00:42:34,825
- Hold on. - "Pick Me".

1245
00:42:34,919 --> 00:42:37,619
You have 30 seconds to look up the lyrics.

1246
00:42:37,620 --> 00:42:40,059
- Start. - Hold on.

1247
00:42:40,060 --> 00:42:41,729
Can't we see the English lyrics?

1248
00:42:41,730 --> 00:42:43,659
"We're girls with a dream..."

1249
00:42:43,660 --> 00:42:45,135
What's "shining light" in Korean?

1250
00:42:45,759 --> 00:42:47,505
- Shining light - Shining light

1251
00:42:48,259 --> 00:42:49,374
Soft light

1252
00:42:49,600 --> 00:42:51,168
- Pick me, pick me - Should we step back?

1253
00:42:51,169 --> 00:42:52,199
Hold on.

1254
00:42:52,200 --> 00:42:54,044
- What's with your moves? - Is this wrong?

1255
00:42:54,700 --> 00:42:56,608
- I'm a pushover. - Is that it?

1256
00:42:56,609 --> 00:42:58,378
- I'm a pushover. - This is Apink.

1257
00:42:58,379 --> 00:42:59,438
Is this Apink?

1258
00:42:59,439 --> 00:43:01,479
(It's pushover dance.)

1259
00:43:01,480 --> 00:43:03,749
Get your microphone.

1260
00:43:03,750 --> 00:43:05,048
- "Feel me..." - "Beautiful..."

1261
00:43:05,049 --> 00:43:06,695
"Show you my paradise..."

1262
00:43:06,879 --> 00:43:08,688
- "Show you my paradise." - "Show you my paradise."

1263
00:43:08,689 --> 00:43:10,325
- Get your microphone. - All right.

1264
00:43:10,419 --> 00:43:11,965
I.O.I!

1265
00:43:12,489 --> 00:43:15,264
- Mina is one of them. - We get to hear this!

1266
00:43:15,460 --> 00:43:17,735
(Mina feels shy.)

1267
00:43:18,230 --> 00:43:19,298
That's Mina!

1268
00:43:19,299 --> 00:43:20,535
(Mina winks.)

1269
00:43:20,629 --> 00:43:22,099
(This is the moment we share our dreams)

1270
00:43:22,100 --> 00:43:24,369
- For you who is sweet - For you who is sweet

1271
00:43:24,370 --> 00:43:26,838
(She has to translate "shining light" into Korean.)

1272
00:43:26,839 --> 00:43:28,075
Shining light

1273
00:43:29,210 --> 00:43:31,184
(She did well.)

1274
00:43:31,210 --> 00:43:33,838
(It's your day, hey baby)

1275
00:43:33,839 --> 00:43:35,048
Hey baby

1276
00:43:35,049 --> 00:43:37,124
Show you my paradise

1277
00:43:37,810 --> 00:43:39,718
(She successfully translated all the English words.)

1278
00:43:39,719 --> 00:43:40,994
It has a lot of English words.

1279
00:43:42,149 --> 00:43:44,564
- I want you - I want you, pick me up

1280
00:43:44,589 --> 00:43:46,434
Pick me, pick me, pick me up

1281
00:43:46,819 --> 00:43:49,564
(She sings in Korean instead.)

1282
00:43:50,029 --> 00:43:53,729
Pick me, pick me, pick me up

1283
00:43:53,730 --> 00:43:55,704
- Pick me, pick me, pick me up - I love this!

1284
00:43:55,730 --> 00:43:57,644
- This is amazing! - I like it!

1285
00:43:57,930 --> 00:43:59,244
- Pick me, pick me... - This is nice!

1286
00:43:59,969 --> 00:44:02,014
You can't help but sing in English.

1287
00:44:02,210 --> 00:44:03,309
Show us the dance.

1288
00:44:03,310 --> 00:44:05,084
(They dance during the interlude.)

1289
00:44:05,640 --> 00:44:07,454
- This is hard. - Look at So Min.

1290
00:44:07,739 --> 00:44:09,579
Way to go!

1291
00:44:09,580 --> 00:44:11,878
(So Min shows off her moves.)

1292
00:44:11,879 --> 00:44:13,255
Look at So Min's hips.

1293
00:44:13,379 --> 00:44:14,825
So Min...

1294
00:44:16,189 --> 00:44:18,325
(So Min moves her hips.)

1295
00:44:19,089 --> 00:44:21,635
(The best dancer ever)

1296
00:44:21,660 --> 00:44:22,929
The song won't start!

1297
00:44:22,930 --> 00:44:24,405
(So Min's dance is so cute.)

1298
00:44:24,830 --> 00:44:26,699
- Pick me, pick me, pick me up - Pick me, pick me, pick me up

1299
00:44:26,700 --> 00:44:28,644
- Pick me, pick me, pick me up - Pick me, pick me, pick me up

1300
00:44:29,200 --> 00:44:31,345
(She keeps moving her hips.)

1301
00:44:31,430 --> 00:44:32,575
(She's doing the same moves the whole time.)

1302
00:44:33,370 --> 00:44:35,909
(So Min's boring moves continue.)

1303
00:44:35,910 --> 00:44:38,314
(The song is nearing its end.)

1304
00:44:38,910 --> 00:44:40,438
So Min is hilarious.

1305
00:44:40,439 --> 00:44:41,854
Pick me, pick me, pick me up

1306
00:44:42,180 --> 00:44:43,209
That was funny.

1307
00:44:43,210 --> 00:44:45,555
Pick me up

1308
00:44:45,980 --> 00:44:47,624
"Pick me up"?

1309
00:44:48,450 --> 00:44:50,218
- Pick me up - I want you

1310
00:44:50,219 --> 00:44:52,218
- Pick me up - Pick me up

1311
00:44:52,219 --> 00:44:53,365
(So Min shows off her talent.)

1312
00:44:54,089 --> 00:44:56,789
Pick me, pick me, pick me up

1313
00:44:56,790 --> 00:44:58,135
- They got 95 points. - 95 points.

1314
00:44:59,230 --> 00:45:00,704
- They got 95 points. - 95 points.

1315
00:45:00,960 --> 00:45:02,769
- Pick me, pick me, pick me up - Pick me, pick me, pick me up

1316
00:45:02,770 --> 00:45:06,238
- Pick me, pick me, pick me up - Pick me, pick me, pick me up

1317
00:45:06,239 --> 00:45:07,898
- So Min is so funny. - Look at her.

1318
00:45:07,899 --> 00:45:10,385
- That's not how you dance! - Pick me, pick me, pick me up

1319
00:45:10,569 --> 00:45:11,814
No?

1320
00:45:11,980 --> 00:45:13,255
It's so annoying.

1321
00:45:13,410 --> 00:45:14,655
It's ridiculous.

1322
00:45:14,839 --> 00:45:17,224
You got 95 points.

1323
00:45:17,279 --> 00:45:19,095
And you failed to translate...

1324
00:45:20,120 --> 00:45:22,218
(Each time you fail, you lose 5 points.)

1325
00:45:22,219 --> 00:45:23,918
4 times, so you lose 20 points.

1326
00:45:23,919 --> 00:45:25,318
- 4 times? - Your final score is 75 points.

1327
00:45:25,319 --> 00:45:27,059
- We did well. I'm relieved. - It was hard.

1328
00:45:27,060 --> 00:45:28,218
It was really hard.

1329
00:45:28,219 --> 00:45:30,305
- Pick me up - Pick me up

1330
00:45:30,589 --> 00:45:32,199
(It's addictive.)

1331
00:45:32,200 --> 00:45:33,229
That's perfect.

1332
00:45:33,230 --> 00:45:35,369
- Whose turn is it now? - It's my turn.

1333
00:45:35,370 --> 00:45:37,369
- It's better to go first. - We have Tiffany.

1334
00:45:37,370 --> 00:45:40,215
(What song will Team Tiffany sing?)

1335
00:45:40,370 --> 00:45:42,568
- What song is it? - "Gangnam Style".

1336
00:45:42,569 --> 00:45:44,385
(Team Tiffany will sing "Gangnam Style".)

1337
00:45:45,210 --> 00:45:47,755
("Gangnam Style" by PSY was loved all over the world.)

1338
00:45:48,210 --> 00:45:50,479
(Foreigners could easily sing along...)

1339
00:45:50,480 --> 00:45:53,155
(because the song has many English words.)

1340
00:45:53,379 --> 00:45:54,918
Does this song have English words too?

1341
00:45:54,919 --> 00:45:56,619
- It doesn't have many. - "Style"...

1342
00:45:56,620 --> 00:45:58,048
- How should we translate "style"? - You have 30 seconds.

1343
00:45:58,049 --> 00:45:59,365
- What's "style" in Korean? - What's "style"?

1344
00:45:59,489 --> 00:46:00,695
Gangnam "meot-jaeng-i"

1345
00:46:01,359 --> 00:46:03,204
- "Mo-yang-sae". - "Mo-yang-sae".

1346
00:46:03,230 --> 00:46:04,764
- Gangnam "maep-si" - Gangnam "maep-si"

1347
00:46:06,730 --> 00:46:08,075
I'm Gangnam "maep-si"

1348
00:46:09,330 --> 00:46:11,329
("Maep-si" is a Korean word that means a "nice appearance".)

1349
00:46:11,330 --> 00:46:12,575
I'm Gangnam "maep-si"

1350
00:46:12,899 --> 00:46:14,244
I'm Gangnam "maep-si"

1351
00:46:14,870 --> 00:46:16,845
I'm Gangnam "maep-si"

1352
00:46:16,910 --> 00:46:18,068
Try Gangnam "mo-yang-sae".

1353
00:46:18,069 --> 00:46:19,938
- "Mo-yang-sae". - Yes.

1354
00:46:19,939 --> 00:46:22,378
In 10 seconds, the song will start.

1355
00:46:22,379 --> 00:46:24,025
How should we translate coffee? Bean water?

1356
00:46:24,250 --> 00:46:25,349
- Bean water? - Here we go.

1357
00:46:25,350 --> 00:46:27,055
- The music starts. - What should we do?

1358
00:46:27,120 --> 00:46:28,249
"Mo-yang-sae".

1359
00:46:28,250 --> 00:46:29,825
("Gangnam Style")

1360
00:46:30,419 --> 00:46:32,088
(Foreign words are spread throughout the song.)

1361
00:46:32,089 --> 00:46:34,564
(Will they be able to translate them all into Korean?)

1362
00:46:34,790 --> 00:46:38,229
A woman who is kind and friendly in the day

1363
00:46:38,230 --> 00:46:40,434
A woman who can enjoy a cup of bean water

1364
00:46:40,700 --> 00:46:43,144
(He translate "coffee" as "bean water".)

1365
00:46:43,830 --> 00:46:46,414
- A woman with that kind of twist - A woman with that kind of twist

1366
00:46:47,339 --> 00:46:49,039
I'm a man

1367
00:46:49,040 --> 00:46:51,979
In the day, I'm just as kind as you are

1368
00:46:51,980 --> 00:46:54,209
- Bean water! - I'm that kind of man

1369
00:46:54,210 --> 00:46:56,378
I "one-shot" my bean water before it cools down

1370
00:46:56,379 --> 00:46:58,925
("One-shot")

1371
00:46:59,049 --> 00:47:00,449
That's English!

1372
00:47:00,450 --> 00:47:01,818
(She said English words.)

1373
00:47:01,819 --> 00:47:03,294
(They missed it!)

1374
00:47:03,719 --> 00:47:06,418
(She should have translated it into Korean.)

1375
00:47:06,419 --> 00:47:07,488
I'm Gangnam "mo-yang-sae"

1376
00:47:07,489 --> 00:47:09,204
(The part with English words begins.)

1377
00:47:10,639 --> 00:47:12,248
- Gangnam style. - Gangnam style.

1378
00:47:12,249 --> 00:47:13,824
I'm Gangnam "mo-yang-sae"

1379
00:47:14,510 --> 00:47:16,078
- Gangnam "mo-yang-sae"? - Gangnam style.

1380
00:47:16,079 --> 00:47:17,324
Gangnam "mo-yang-sae"

1381
00:47:17,450 --> 00:47:18,824
Gangnam "maep-si"!

1382
00:47:19,220 --> 00:47:20,949
I'm Gangnam "mo-yang-sae"

1383
00:47:20,950 --> 00:47:22,835
He's such an old man.

1384
00:47:22,959 --> 00:47:24,494
- He looks so old. - Gangnam "mo-yang-sae"

1385
00:47:25,189 --> 00:47:26,335
What's with his moves?

1386
00:47:26,959 --> 00:47:28,065
He looks so old.

1387
00:47:28,430 --> 00:47:29,558
(What's with Ji Hyo?)

1388
00:47:29,559 --> 00:47:30,728
What's that?

1389
00:47:30,729 --> 00:47:32,399
I've never seen moves like those.

1390
00:47:32,400 --> 00:47:33,469
Gangnam "mo-yang-sae"

1391
00:47:33,470 --> 00:47:35,275
What are those moves?

1392
00:47:36,070 --> 00:47:37,299
(Their moves look weird.)

1393
00:47:37,300 --> 00:47:38,574
What's that?

1394
00:47:39,039 --> 00:47:41,339
(Sexy lady)

1395
00:47:41,340 --> 00:47:43,415
Sexy lady

1396
00:47:44,110 --> 00:47:46,255
(He translated "sexy lady" into Korean.)

1397
00:47:46,410 --> 00:47:48,578
(Sexy lady)

1398
00:47:48,579 --> 00:47:50,755
Sexy lady

1399
00:47:51,220 --> 00:47:53,165
- Is this a trot song? - He's good.

1400
00:47:53,789 --> 00:47:56,864
Baby, baby, I know something

1401
00:47:57,860 --> 00:48:00,235
(The next part has a lot of English words.)

1402
00:48:02,360 --> 00:48:05,399
(Will Seok Jin be able to translate the words into Korean?)

1403
00:48:05,400 --> 00:48:07,828
- I know something - You know what?

1404
00:48:07,829 --> 00:48:10,899
You know what I'm saying? I'm Gangnam "mo-yang-sae"!

1405
00:48:10,900 --> 00:48:14,185
(You know what I'm saying? I'm Gangnam "mo-yang-sae"!)

1406
00:48:14,740 --> 00:48:16,554
(Perfect)

1407
00:48:16,809 --> 00:48:18,879
(Seok Jin pulled that off?)

1408
00:48:18,880 --> 00:48:20,554
(This was actually incredible.)

1409
00:48:21,380 --> 00:48:22,748
(They finished "Gangnam Style" without making many mistakes.)

1410
00:48:22,749 --> 00:48:24,455
- I'm Gangnam "mo-yang-sae" - I'm Gangnam "mo-yang-sae"

1411
00:48:26,019 --> 00:48:27,388
(You did a good job.)

1412
00:48:27,389 --> 00:48:29,319
- That was hard. - You struggled in the beginning.

1413
00:48:29,320 --> 00:48:30,388
That was incredible.

1414
00:48:30,389 --> 00:48:32,759
(What will be the karaoke score?)

1415
00:48:32,760 --> 00:48:35,359
- "Baby". - 91 points.

1416
00:48:35,360 --> 00:48:37,904
You scored 91 points.

1417
00:48:38,229 --> 00:48:40,944
- You got six parts wrong. - We missed the beginning.

1418
00:48:41,900 --> 00:48:43,768
With 6 wrong parts, you scored 61 points.

1419
00:48:43,769 --> 00:48:44,915
We missed the beginning.

1420
00:48:44,999 --> 00:48:46,739
- You scored 61 points. - We missed the beginning.

1421
00:48:46,740 --> 00:48:48,239
- We have one team below us. - As long as we're not last.

1422
00:48:48,240 --> 00:48:50,679
- We didn't place last. - Take points off for their dance.

1423
00:48:50,680 --> 00:48:52,679
- Don't be ridiculous. - What was this?

1424
00:48:52,680 --> 00:48:54,149
- Hey. - What was this?

1425
00:48:54,150 --> 00:48:56,478
- How was I supposed to dance? - Ji Hyo looked like Ppak Gu.

1426
00:48:56,479 --> 00:48:57,779
You looked like...

1427
00:48:57,780 --> 00:48:58,949
- Ma Ppak. - The dance looked ridiculous.

1428
00:48:58,950 --> 00:49:01,049
The dance looked ridiculous.

1429
00:49:01,050 --> 00:49:02,489
- How was I supposed to dance? - Ma Ppak.

1430
00:49:02,490 --> 00:49:03,558
The third team.

1431
00:49:03,559 --> 00:49:04,618
Ma Ppak.

1432
00:49:04,619 --> 00:49:06,565
- Yu Na. - Take the center.

1433
00:49:06,789 --> 00:49:08,065
Go forward.

1434
00:49:08,090 --> 00:49:10,235
- Please let it be... - Let's go.

1435
00:49:10,329 --> 00:49:12,469
- It's a hard one. - It's a hard one.

1436
00:49:12,470 --> 00:49:13,469
- Girls' hip-hop song. - What is it?

1437
00:49:13,470 --> 00:49:14,868
- What is it? - Give them a hip-hop song.

1438
00:49:14,869 --> 00:49:15,998
"Heartbeat" by 2PM.

1439
00:49:15,999 --> 00:49:17,844
("Heartbeat" by 2PM)

1440
00:49:18,669 --> 00:49:19,969
(English)

1441
00:49:19,970 --> 00:49:23,009
(More English)

1442
00:49:23,010 --> 00:49:24,955
(It might as well be a pop song.)

1443
00:49:25,139 --> 00:49:26,578
I don't know the rap.

1444
00:49:26,579 --> 00:49:27,808
Music, please.

1445
00:49:27,809 --> 00:49:30,319
- "It's beating for you." - Grab the microphone and begin.

1446
00:49:30,320 --> 00:49:31,918
"It's beating for you."

1447
00:49:31,919 --> 00:49:34,125
- We need to start! - We're waiting for you.

1448
00:49:34,389 --> 00:49:36,288
(The song has already begun.)

1449
00:49:36,289 --> 00:49:37,458
- The intro passed in a blur. - We need to start!

1450
00:49:37,459 --> 00:49:39,105
- We're waiting for you. - We need to begin now!

1451
00:49:39,360 --> 00:49:41,129
(Heartbeat)

1452
00:49:41,130 --> 00:49:42,605
Heartbeat

1453
00:49:42,800 --> 00:49:44,659
"Heartbeat"!

1454
00:49:44,660 --> 00:49:46,828
- Heartbeat - Let's go!

1455
00:49:46,829 --> 00:49:48,328
You are good.

1456
00:49:48,329 --> 00:49:49,839
Why is this song depressing?

1457
00:49:49,840 --> 00:49:51,399
You are good.

1458
00:49:51,400 --> 00:49:54,009
(I don't know the rap.)

1459
00:49:54,010 --> 00:49:57,239
No matter how hard I try to forget No matter how many people I meet

1460
00:49:57,240 --> 00:49:58,239
There you go!

1461
00:49:58,240 --> 00:50:00,708
(She fires off the rap without any emotions.)

1462
00:50:00,709 --> 00:50:01,808
There you go!

1463
00:50:01,809 --> 00:50:04,554
(They copy the dance perfectly.)

1464
00:50:06,119 --> 00:50:08,194
(They are good.)

1465
00:50:08,249 --> 00:50:09,458
It's Korean.

1466
00:50:09,459 --> 00:50:11,034
- Come on. - It's Korean.

1467
00:50:12,130 --> 00:50:14,764
(They sing together because the lyrics are Korean.)

1468
00:50:15,360 --> 00:50:16,799
They are good.

1469
00:50:16,800 --> 00:50:18,259
Read the lyrics.

1470
00:50:18,260 --> 00:50:19,498
(I don't know why I think you might come)

1471
00:50:19,499 --> 00:50:21,145
Here it comes.

1472
00:50:22,070 --> 00:50:24,038
- Here it comes. - Come on.

1473
00:50:24,039 --> 00:50:25,098
Here comes English.

1474
00:50:25,099 --> 00:50:27,685
Listen to my heartbeat

1475
00:50:27,910 --> 00:50:30,255
- "For you". - For you. Listen to my heartbeat.

1476
00:50:31,180 --> 00:50:33,149
(They continue to get points deducted.)

1477
00:50:33,150 --> 00:50:34,585
"Listen to my heartbeat."

1478
00:50:36,079 --> 00:50:37,379
(They continue to get points deducted,)

1479
00:50:37,380 --> 00:50:39,319
(but Se Chan is excited.)

1480
00:50:39,320 --> 00:50:40,864
(What is up with him?)

1481
00:50:42,289 --> 00:50:43,395
Se Chan.

1482
00:50:43,990 --> 00:50:46,005
(Overly emotional)

1483
00:50:46,590 --> 00:50:48,899
(Not knowing what lies ahead of him,)

1484
00:50:48,900 --> 00:50:51,235
(he becomes absorbed in the song.)

1485
00:50:52,030 --> 00:50:54,844
(The most difficult English part awaits Se Chan.)

1486
00:50:58,769 --> 00:51:02,185
(How will he get by?)

1487
00:51:02,910 --> 00:51:04,509
Otherwise, I will die

1488
00:51:04,510 --> 00:51:06,185
- Stop - No.

1489
00:51:06,479 --> 00:51:07,949
- Woman - No! No!

1490
00:51:07,950 --> 00:51:09,125
(Stop)

1491
00:51:09,550 --> 00:51:11,225
- Woman - No! No!

1492
00:51:11,419 --> 00:51:13,225
(It's game over for that team.)

1493
00:51:13,419 --> 00:51:15,018
Hey, come on.

1494
00:51:15,019 --> 00:51:16,518
Oh, no.

1495
00:51:16,519 --> 00:51:17,558
What are you doing?

1496
00:51:17,559 --> 00:51:19,105
He missed so many lines.

1497
00:51:19,860 --> 00:51:21,629
She erased all of me

1498
00:51:21,630 --> 00:51:23,159
Why can't I do the same?

1499
00:51:23,160 --> 00:51:24,435
"Listen to my heartbeat."

1500
00:51:24,660 --> 00:51:26,875
(It's another English part.)

1501
00:51:27,070 --> 00:51:28,598
- My heartbeat - "Listen to my heartbeat."

1502
00:51:28,599 --> 00:51:31,214
- "It's beating for you." - For you!

1503
00:51:33,010 --> 00:51:34,538
- "It's beating for you." - It's waiting for you!

1504
00:51:34,539 --> 00:51:35,685
(I still don't know it's over)

1505
00:51:35,979 --> 00:51:38,114
(It looks like they gave up.)

1506
00:51:38,950 --> 00:51:40,554
(I give up.)

1507
00:51:41,150 --> 00:51:43,879
I don't understand why it's like that

1508
00:51:43,880 --> 00:51:44,879
"Listen to my heartbeat."

1509
00:51:44,880 --> 00:51:47,288
- Listen to my heart - "For me".

1510
00:51:47,289 --> 00:51:50,759
- "It's beating for you." - It's beating for you... Me

1511
00:51:50,760 --> 00:51:51,835
(Thoughts of you)

1512
00:51:52,229 --> 00:51:54,159
Me! You!

1513
00:51:54,160 --> 00:51:55,799
Thoughts of you

1514
00:51:55,800 --> 00:51:57,435
(What are they going to do?)

1515
00:51:58,030 --> 00:51:59,429
- Heart - "My heart is beating."

1516
00:51:59,430 --> 00:52:00,998
My heart is beating faster

1517
00:52:00,999 --> 00:52:02,775
- "Faster and faster." - Faster and faster

1518
00:52:03,070 --> 00:52:05,645
Come on. Let him do it alone.

1519
00:52:06,309 --> 00:52:07,339
It's almost over.

1520
00:52:07,340 --> 00:52:08,614
- Let him do it alone. - Keep going.

1521
00:52:08,740 --> 00:52:10,114
It's almost over.

1522
00:52:10,510 --> 00:52:13,549
"Faster and faster."

1523
00:52:13,550 --> 00:52:15,279
(Se Chan tries to sing,)

1524
00:52:15,280 --> 00:52:16,795
(but the song ends.)

1525
00:52:17,780 --> 00:52:20,725
(His heart stops.)

1526
00:52:21,050 --> 00:52:24,089
- Bravo, bravo. - Bravo.

1527
00:52:24,090 --> 00:52:26,989
"Me! You! You!"

1528
00:52:26,990 --> 00:52:28,029
"Me!"

1529
00:52:28,030 --> 00:52:30,904
- 36 points! - They got 36 points!

1530
00:52:31,829 --> 00:52:34,828
(Their karaoke score is 36 points.)

1531
00:52:34,829 --> 00:52:36,969
- They will get a negative score. - We won't place last.

1532
00:52:36,970 --> 00:52:38,469
We definitely won't place last.

1533
00:52:38,470 --> 00:52:40,739
You will get 75 points deducted for getting 15 parts wrong.

1534
00:52:40,740 --> 00:52:42,179
You got 15 parts wrong.

1535
00:52:42,180 --> 00:52:44,284
- Come on out. - How did we do so badly?

1536
00:52:44,410 --> 00:52:46,255
There was cardiac arrest.

1537
00:52:46,349 --> 00:52:47,909
- At the end of the song... - Beep.

1538
00:52:47,910 --> 00:52:49,748
- That's right. - At the end of the song...

1539
00:52:49,749 --> 00:52:50,848
We died.

1540
00:52:50,849 --> 00:52:52,395
- Seriously. - The last team.

1541
00:52:52,490 --> 00:52:53,864
We need to read the lyrics.

1542
00:52:53,990 --> 00:52:56,159
- I hope it has English lyrics. - We need to look up the words.

1543
00:52:56,160 --> 00:52:58,118
"Red Flavor" by Red Velvet.

1544
00:52:58,119 --> 00:52:59,364
("Red Flavor" by Red Velvet)

1545
00:53:00,729 --> 00:53:03,259
(It's much easier than "Heartbeat".)

1546
00:53:03,260 --> 00:53:07,768
(However, there are English words that are written in Korean.)

1547
00:53:07,769 --> 00:53:09,538
- "The corner candy shop" - "The corner candy shop"

1548
00:53:09,539 --> 00:53:11,138
- "The corner candy shop" - "The corner candy shop"

1549
00:53:11,139 --> 00:53:12,609
- "Look for it" - "Look for it"

1550
00:53:12,610 --> 00:53:14,714
Stop using the phone.

1551
00:53:15,539 --> 00:53:17,938
(Red flavor, I am curious)

1552
00:53:17,939 --> 00:53:19,485
- "Baby". - Baby

1553
00:53:20,110 --> 00:53:21,985
(They have a shaky start.)

1554
00:53:22,519 --> 00:53:23,594
"Baby"?

1555
00:53:24,680 --> 00:53:26,989
(The corner candy shop)

1556
00:53:26,990 --> 00:53:29,034
(Look for it, baby)

1557
00:53:29,119 --> 00:53:31,494
It's "The corner candy shop", not "The corner shop".

1558
00:53:31,619 --> 00:53:33,288
They translated "Honey" wrong too.

1559
00:53:33,289 --> 00:53:34,429
1, 2, 3.

1560
00:53:34,430 --> 00:53:35,458
(Red flavor)

1561
00:53:35,459 --> 00:53:36,598
"Honey".

1562
00:53:36,599 --> 00:53:38,058
(I am curious, honey)

1563
00:53:38,059 --> 00:53:40,475
- When I bite into it - "The taste of strawberry".

1564
00:53:40,800 --> 00:53:42,399
- The taste of strawberry spreads - The taste of strawberry spreads

1565
00:53:42,400 --> 00:53:44,839
- The corner candy shop - The corner candy shop

1566
00:53:44,840 --> 00:53:46,909
- "Look for it, baby." - What I like the best is

1567
00:53:46,910 --> 00:53:48,668
(We are doing great!)

1568
00:53:48,669 --> 00:53:50,585
The taste of summer

1569
00:53:51,079 --> 00:53:52,578
(Peach)

1570
00:53:52,579 --> 00:53:53,748
What?

1571
00:53:53,749 --> 00:53:55,125
What is this?

1572
00:53:55,410 --> 00:53:57,248
- Hold on. - Here it comes.

1573
00:53:57,249 --> 00:53:58,679
Here it comes.

1574
00:53:58,680 --> 00:54:00,118
(Peach juice, sweet and sour mix)

1575
00:54:00,119 --> 00:54:01,525
(Mood, brew red to make a cocktail for you)

1576
00:54:01,650 --> 00:54:02,735
What?

1577
00:54:03,559 --> 00:54:05,058
(Brew red to make a cocktail for you)

1578
00:54:05,059 --> 00:54:06,335
What?

1579
00:54:06,860 --> 00:54:08,558
- Hold on. - Here it comes.

1580
00:54:08,559 --> 00:54:10,134
Here it comes.

1581
00:54:10,360 --> 00:54:11,498
What is this?

1582
00:54:11,499 --> 00:54:14,299
The feelings beyond imagination Up and down, bang

1583
00:54:14,300 --> 00:54:16,444
Let's shout, I like you to be honest

1584
00:54:16,939 --> 00:54:18,368
Gosh, what is this?

1585
00:54:18,369 --> 00:54:19,938
We fall in love

1586
00:54:19,939 --> 00:54:21,784
(We might not place last!)

1587
00:54:22,010 --> 00:54:24,315
Please get it even if I don't use words

1588
00:54:24,610 --> 00:54:26,324
He is using a dialect.

1589
00:54:26,950 --> 00:54:28,884
(The cheerful song suddenly takes on a homey vibe.)

1590
00:54:29,249 --> 00:54:33,449
What I like the best is the taste of summer

1591
00:54:33,450 --> 00:54:37,319
What I like the best is you in summer

1592
00:54:37,320 --> 00:54:38,764
We might not place last.

1593
00:54:38,789 --> 00:54:40,464
- This is good. - We might not place last.

1594
00:54:40,689 --> 00:54:42,399
- The karaoke score. - What's the score?

1595
00:54:42,400 --> 00:54:43,458
What's the score?

1596
00:54:43,459 --> 00:54:45,174
(What could be Team Chi Yeul's karaoke score?)

1597
00:54:45,769 --> 00:54:46,998
It will be okay as long as we don't place last.

1598
00:54:46,999 --> 00:54:48,505
(Please let it be a low score.)

1599
00:54:50,300 --> 00:54:51,538
- 81 points. - It's good.

1600
00:54:51,539 --> 00:54:53,109
It's a good score.

1601
00:54:53,110 --> 00:54:54,469
(Their karaoke score is 81 points.)

1602
00:54:54,470 --> 00:54:55,879
It's a good score.

1603
00:54:55,880 --> 00:54:57,708
It makes no sense that we scored 36 points.

1604
00:54:57,709 --> 00:54:59,525
How did we get a score in the 30s?

1605
00:54:59,550 --> 00:55:01,909
From 81 points, you will get 55 points deducted...

1606
00:55:01,910 --> 00:55:04,379
- since you got 11 parts wrong. - We placed 1st!

1607
00:55:04,380 --> 00:55:05,824
Your score is 26 points.

1608
00:55:06,720 --> 00:55:08,319
(We managed to avoid placing last.)

1609
00:55:08,320 --> 00:55:09,589
We placed first!

1610
00:55:09,590 --> 00:55:10,918
(Team Mina placed 1st.)

1611
00:55:10,919 --> 00:55:14,159
Thus, Team Yu Na placed last.

1612
00:55:14,160 --> 00:55:15,388
(Team Yu Na placed last.)

1613
00:55:15,389 --> 00:55:17,804
I'm speechless.

1614
00:55:18,430 --> 00:55:19,598
(The current number of persimmon badges)

1615
00:55:19,599 --> 00:55:20,868
- Okay. - Okay.

1616
00:55:20,869 --> 00:55:22,875
(Team Yu Na, Team Chi Yeul, Team Tiffany, Team Mina)

1617
00:55:23,470 --> 00:55:25,714
Let's move on to the final mission.

1618
00:55:25,910 --> 00:55:27,038
What is this?

1619
00:55:27,039 --> 00:55:28,114
(Four boards suddenly enter.)

1620
00:55:28,570 --> 00:55:30,755
Rip off other teams' name tags...

1621
00:55:31,240 --> 00:55:32,679
(Rip off other teams' name tags)

1622
00:55:32,680 --> 00:55:35,779
to obtain a letter you need in the Korean Letters on My Back.

1623
00:55:35,780 --> 00:55:36,779
Is it the Name Tag Elimination?

1624
00:55:36,780 --> 00:55:37,994
(Korean Letters on My Back)

1625
00:55:38,450 --> 00:55:40,864
All four teams will play the Name Tag Elimination.

1626
00:55:41,249 --> 00:55:44,759
Each team will choose 1 out of 4 sentences.

1627
00:55:44,760 --> 00:55:47,429
Fill in the blanks by ripping off name tags...

1628
00:55:47,430 --> 00:55:48,659
and obtaining a letter at a time.

1629
00:55:48,660 --> 00:55:52,098
Complete the sentence so that it makes sense.

1630
00:55:52,099 --> 00:55:54,944
The team that completes the sentence last places last.

1631
00:55:55,229 --> 00:55:56,299
(It will be hard.)

1632
00:55:56,300 --> 00:55:58,399
If you need multiple letters from one name,

1633
00:55:58,400 --> 00:56:00,668
you need to rip off the name tag multiple times.

1634
00:56:00,669 --> 00:56:01,768
(You need to rip off the name tag multiple times.)

1635
00:56:01,769 --> 00:56:03,978
- No one gets eliminated. - No.

1636
00:56:03,979 --> 00:56:05,279
If you need another letter from So Min's name,

1637
00:56:05,280 --> 00:56:06,649
rip off her name tag again.

1638
00:56:06,650 --> 00:56:09,125
Seok Jin's words were hilarious.

1639
00:56:09,650 --> 00:56:11,348
(What did I say?)

1640
00:56:11,349 --> 00:56:13,449
After listening for a while, he went, "What is he saying?"

1641
00:56:13,450 --> 00:56:15,565
(What is he saying?)

1642
00:56:15,889 --> 00:56:18,489
(The producer was explaining the rules.)

1643
00:56:18,490 --> 00:56:19,558
- What is he saying? - For example...

1644
00:56:19,559 --> 00:56:20,665
(What is he saying?)

1645
00:56:21,459 --> 00:56:23,429
Getting your name tag ripped off doesn't remove you from the game.

1646
00:56:23,430 --> 00:56:26,429
However, everyone must stop for a few seconds.

1647
00:56:26,430 --> 00:56:28,929
Even if you complete your sentence,

1648
00:56:28,930 --> 00:56:32,098
you must participate in the game...

1649
00:56:32,099 --> 00:56:33,909
until the last team is decided.

1650
00:56:33,910 --> 00:56:35,815
You need to provide the name tags.

1651
00:56:35,979 --> 00:56:38,284
The team that finishes first...

1652
00:56:38,340 --> 00:56:41,149
- could decide to help other teams. - I see.

1653
00:56:41,150 --> 00:56:44,018
Are we allowed to rip off our team members' name tags?

1654
00:56:44,019 --> 00:56:46,618
(Are we allowed to rip off our team members' name tags?)

1655
00:56:46,619 --> 00:56:47,719
(Can we finish off our team members?)

1656
00:56:47,720 --> 00:56:49,464
Of course not.

1657
00:56:49,619 --> 00:56:51,764
Did you have to embarrass Ji Hyo like that?

1658
00:56:51,990 --> 00:56:53,558
- For goodness' sake. - Don't be mistaken.

1659
00:56:53,559 --> 00:56:55,034
My face turned red.

1660
00:56:55,160 --> 00:56:57,399
This team is really slow.

1661
00:56:57,400 --> 00:56:59,868
(This team is really slow.)

1662
00:56:59,869 --> 00:57:00,929
(They don't know the rules.)

1663
00:57:00,930 --> 00:57:02,538
They drive me crazy.

1664
00:57:02,539 --> 00:57:04,168
I bet you don't know the rules either.

1665
00:57:04,169 --> 00:57:05,368
They are so slow.

1666
00:57:05,369 --> 00:57:07,839
Let's check the sentences.

1667
00:57:07,840 --> 00:57:08,944
Okay.

1668
00:57:09,610 --> 00:57:11,409
(Team Tiffany's sentence)

1669
00:57:11,410 --> 00:57:12,509
"She..."

1670
00:57:12,510 --> 00:57:16,179
"She likes 'Blank',"

1671
00:57:16,180 --> 00:57:17,649
"so her nickname is 'Blank'."

1672
00:57:17,650 --> 00:57:19,694
"There was no 'Blank' for the date,"

1673
00:57:20,220 --> 00:57:21,748
"so I borrowed 'Blank'."

1674
00:57:21,749 --> 00:57:23,418
"I met my date at 'Blank'..."

1675
00:57:23,419 --> 00:57:25,395
"and became surprised since she resembled 'Blank'."

1676
00:57:25,590 --> 00:57:27,089
"I like my lover's 'Blank', but I hate my lover's 'Blank."

1677
00:57:27,090 --> 00:57:28,359
(Team Mina's sentence)

1678
00:57:28,360 --> 00:57:30,498
- We need to fill in both blanks. - Yes.

1679
00:57:30,499 --> 00:57:31,828
(All teams check the sentences.)

1680
00:57:31,829 --> 00:57:33,444
We need to complete this sentence...

1681
00:57:33,530 --> 00:57:35,844
with the letters from other people's names.

1682
00:57:36,400 --> 00:57:38,638
Young... Young... Youngkwang!

1683
00:57:38,639 --> 00:57:40,168
- What? - Youngkwang!

1684
00:57:40,169 --> 00:57:41,339
(Young from Mi Young and Kwang from Kwang Soo)

1685
00:57:41,340 --> 00:57:42,938
- Okay, okay. - We are set.

1686
00:57:42,939 --> 00:57:45,585
- We are set. This is great. - We are set.

1687
00:57:46,050 --> 00:57:48,208
Whose name contains "Kwang"?

1688
00:57:48,209 --> 00:57:50,054
(He makes his intentions clear.)

1689
00:57:50,249 --> 00:57:51,418
Run from me.

1690
00:57:51,419 --> 00:57:52,748
(He gives a warning.)

1691
00:57:52,749 --> 00:57:55,364
If your name contains Kwang, Soo, or Lee,

1692
00:57:55,590 --> 00:57:57,034
I will teach you a lesson.

1693
00:57:57,160 --> 00:57:58,319
It's a warning.

1694
00:57:58,320 --> 00:58:00,005
- Hey. - My goodness.

1695
00:58:00,289 --> 00:58:01,464
What?

1696
00:58:02,329 --> 00:58:03,598
(Slapping)

1697
00:58:03,599 --> 00:58:05,868
- What? - You have Jong Kook on your side?

1698
00:58:05,869 --> 00:58:06,929
Be careful.

1699
00:58:06,930 --> 00:58:08,944
Move to your spot.

1700
00:58:09,470 --> 00:58:13,085
(Words to fill in the blanks)

1701
00:58:14,110 --> 00:58:16,714
We should try to get all the letters from one team.

1702
00:58:16,910 --> 00:58:19,384
- Let's rip the name tags. - Yes.

1703
00:58:20,150 --> 00:58:22,879
Hold on. Isn't Haha's last name Ha?

1704
00:58:22,880 --> 00:58:25,518
- Jeon. - Jeon and Ha. Then we need Jee...

1705
00:58:25,519 --> 00:58:26,888
to make "Basement".

1706
00:58:26,889 --> 00:58:29,025
(Team Yu Na can get three letters from Team Mina!)

1707
00:58:29,090 --> 00:58:30,665
That's right.

1708
00:58:30,820 --> 00:58:32,828
We just need to go after that team.

1709
00:58:32,829 --> 00:58:35,235
- Last letter for "basement" is... - That's right.

1710
00:58:35,590 --> 00:58:37,029
I'm Jan So Min.

1711
00:58:37,030 --> 00:58:38,674
(I'm Jan So Min?)

1712
00:58:38,760 --> 00:58:40,069
We just need theirs.

1713
00:58:40,070 --> 00:58:41,205
I'm annoyed.

1714
00:58:41,530 --> 00:58:43,799
Once we get the names from that team, we're done.

1715
00:58:43,800 --> 00:58:45,909
I like my lover's "teeth",

1716
00:58:45,910 --> 00:58:48,284
- but I hate my lover's "plaque". - I hate my lover's "plaque".

1717
00:58:48,439 --> 00:58:51,239
We just need Team Fools' name tags.

1718
00:58:51,240 --> 00:58:54,884
Those fools are strong.

1719
00:58:54,910 --> 00:58:56,819
She likes "teeth", so it's "plaque".

1720
00:58:56,820 --> 00:58:58,618
(Team Tiffany is going after the same letters.)

1721
00:58:58,619 --> 00:58:59,848
All right.

1722
00:58:59,849 --> 00:59:01,319
- Jae Seok. - It's perfect.

1723
00:59:01,320 --> 00:59:02,735
Hurry.

1724
00:59:02,760 --> 00:59:05,388
There were no "side dishes", so we borrowed "fritters".

1725
00:59:05,389 --> 00:59:06,605
(They complete the sentence with Jae Seok's idea.)

1726
00:59:06,930 --> 00:59:08,404
(He realizes something important.)

1727
00:59:09,499 --> 00:59:10,899
Chi Yeul.

1728
00:59:10,900 --> 00:59:12,498
You don't have to smile.

1729
00:59:12,499 --> 00:59:14,728
- Go after "chan" and "jeon". - This is great.

1730
00:59:14,729 --> 00:59:15,899
It's the best.

1731
00:59:15,900 --> 00:59:17,239
Who should we go after?

1732
00:59:17,240 --> 00:59:18,899
Se Chan and So Min.

1733
00:59:18,900 --> 00:59:19,938
(Team Chi Yeul's targets are Se Chan and So Min.)

1734
00:59:19,939 --> 00:59:22,145
I'll count down for the race. 10,

1735
00:59:22,439 --> 00:59:24,339
- We have to do it quickly. - nine,

1736
00:59:24,340 --> 00:59:25,638
- eight, - Let's go after So Min first.

1737
00:59:25,639 --> 00:59:26,725
- So Min? - seven,

1738
00:59:27,309 --> 00:59:29,154
- So Min. - Four.

1739
00:59:29,419 --> 00:59:32,618
Use your looks and tear like this.

1740
00:59:32,619 --> 00:59:34,319
Race starts.

1741
00:59:34,320 --> 00:59:36,165
Let's start from there.

1742
00:59:36,760 --> 00:59:38,589
Race starts.

1743
00:59:38,590 --> 00:59:39,705
(Race starts.)

1744
00:59:40,329 --> 00:59:42,328
We're going after each other.

1745
00:59:42,329 --> 00:59:43,529
(They go to look for their prey.)

1746
00:59:43,530 --> 00:59:45,674
There are letters that overlap.

1747
00:59:46,829 --> 00:59:49,815
If that's the color I see over there,

1748
00:59:49,970 --> 00:59:51,498
- it's Haha. - It's Haha.

1749
00:59:51,499 --> 00:59:52,985
- We have to tear it. - Go after So Min.

1750
00:59:53,039 --> 00:59:54,244
Jae Seok.

1751
00:59:54,869 --> 00:59:57,884
For every name tag you give me, I'll hand over a letter.

1752
00:59:58,309 --> 01:00:00,909
(He'll exchange a name tag with a letter?)

1753
01:00:00,910 --> 01:00:02,848
We should exchange name tags.

1754
01:00:02,849 --> 01:00:04,279
Which letter do you need?

1755
01:00:04,280 --> 01:00:05,748
- What? - Whose name tag do you need?

1756
01:00:05,749 --> 01:00:08,118
For now, I need Chi Yeul's.

1757
01:00:08,119 --> 01:00:09,149
- Mine? - Yes.

1758
01:00:09,150 --> 01:00:11,219
(He's after Chi Yeul.)

1759
01:00:11,220 --> 01:00:13,688
Okay, then give us one as well.

1760
01:00:13,689 --> 01:00:15,429
- I won't betray you. - Really?

1761
01:00:15,430 --> 01:00:17,859
- Yes, sir. - We don't need anything else...

1762
01:00:17,860 --> 01:00:19,058
except for one person's.

1763
01:00:19,059 --> 01:00:20,228
- Whose is it? - So Min's.

1764
01:00:20,229 --> 01:00:21,969
- Really? Do you need "jeon"? - Yes.

1765
01:00:21,970 --> 01:00:23,638
- We only need "jeon". - Right?

1766
01:00:23,639 --> 01:00:26,069
Hey, are you working as a team?

1767
01:00:26,070 --> 01:00:27,538
- By the way, - You can't do that.

1768
01:00:27,539 --> 01:00:30,284
Haha, we have two women on our team.

1769
01:00:30,309 --> 01:00:32,478
You also have two women on your team.

1770
01:00:32,479 --> 01:00:34,025
(They keep a distance.)

1771
01:00:35,079 --> 01:00:37,455
- We hid it. - Are you targeting us?

1772
01:00:38,780 --> 01:00:40,895
(The prey came on its own.)

1773
01:00:42,289 --> 01:00:43,388
(Team Tiffany is after "lee", "chi", and "seok".)

1774
01:00:43,389 --> 01:00:44,688
(Lee Kwang Soo)

1775
01:00:44,689 --> 01:00:45,719
(Hwang Chi Yeul)

1776
01:00:45,720 --> 01:00:47,034
(Yu Jae Seok)

1777
01:00:47,590 --> 01:00:49,759
(Their target is the entire Team Fools.)

1778
01:00:49,760 --> 01:00:51,058
Kwang Soo, they're looking at you.

1779
01:00:51,059 --> 01:00:53,328
- I'm not it, am I? - Kwang Soo.

1780
01:00:53,329 --> 01:00:56,138
Jessica looked at you.

1781
01:00:56,139 --> 01:00:58,239
(Jessica looked at you.)

1782
01:00:58,240 --> 01:01:00,069
She's not Jessica. She's Tiffany.

1783
01:01:00,070 --> 01:01:02,038
(Her real name is Hwang Mi Young.)

1784
01:01:02,039 --> 01:01:04,679
- I'm sorry. - She's not Jessica.

1785
01:01:04,680 --> 01:01:06,255
Mi Young, I'm sorry.

1786
01:01:06,280 --> 01:01:07,509
I'm sorry.

1787
01:01:07,510 --> 01:01:09,949
(I caught you.)

1788
01:01:09,950 --> 01:01:12,594
(He attacks Chi Yeul while he bows.)

1789
01:01:12,789 --> 01:01:15,094
(He turns around quickly.)

1790
01:01:15,990 --> 01:01:17,264
I'm sorry.

1791
01:01:17,720 --> 01:01:18,719
(He's startled.)

1792
01:01:18,720 --> 01:01:21,228
- Are you after Chi Yeul? - No, I just gave it a try.

1793
01:01:21,229 --> 01:01:23,429
- By the way, - His name doesn't work.

1794
01:01:23,430 --> 01:01:24,799
we have two women on our team.

1795
01:01:24,800 --> 01:01:26,228
- Be careful of Haha. - Do something about it.

1796
01:01:26,229 --> 01:01:27,645
Do you need something?

1797
01:01:27,869 --> 01:01:29,244
Do you need something?

1798
01:01:29,329 --> 01:01:30,839
They're all over there.

1799
01:01:30,840 --> 01:01:32,438
Everyone is over there. Wait.

1800
01:01:32,439 --> 01:01:33,868
Should we get Haha's first?

1801
01:01:33,869 --> 01:01:35,438
- Wouldn't that be best? - I think so.

1802
01:01:35,439 --> 01:01:36,978
Go after Haha.

1803
01:01:36,979 --> 01:01:38,739
- Haha. - You startled me.

1804
01:01:38,740 --> 01:01:41,109
- Hey, be careful. - Protect me.

1805
01:01:41,110 --> 01:01:42,279
- Be careful. - Protect me.

1806
01:01:42,280 --> 01:01:44,918
- Protect me. - They're going around that way.

1807
01:01:44,919 --> 01:01:46,788
(Jong Kook)

1808
01:01:46,789 --> 01:01:48,719
- Be careful. - Whose name do you need?

1809
01:01:48,720 --> 01:01:49,964
Whose do you need?

1810
01:01:50,389 --> 01:01:51,859
- They're making a move. - What's wrong with you?

1811
01:01:51,860 --> 01:01:52,859
Why is everyone...

1812
01:01:52,860 --> 01:01:54,489
- staying together? - What's wrong with you?

1813
01:01:54,490 --> 01:01:56,799
(Right then)

1814
01:01:56,800 --> 01:01:59,744
(Haha's bad hand starts to move.)

1815
01:02:00,169 --> 01:02:01,168
Go.

1816
01:02:01,169 --> 01:02:03,339
(He attacks Chi Yeul for his name tag.)

1817
01:02:03,340 --> 01:02:04,768
Come here.

1818
01:02:04,769 --> 01:02:07,739
(He tore it.)

1819
01:02:07,740 --> 01:02:09,239
I got it.

1820
01:02:09,240 --> 01:02:11,638
(This is what betrayal is.)

1821
01:02:11,639 --> 01:02:12,808
(The joy of betrayal is sweet.)

1822
01:02:12,809 --> 01:02:13,955
Goodness.

1823
01:02:14,780 --> 01:02:17,679
Aren't they fools? I knew that he'd tear their name tag.

1824
01:02:17,680 --> 01:02:18,949
Which letter will you take, Haha?

1825
01:02:18,950 --> 01:02:20,118
"Chi".

1826
01:02:20,119 --> 01:02:22,888
(He gets "chi" from Chi Yeul's name tag.)

1827
01:02:22,889 --> 01:02:25,159
(I hate my lover's "chi" something.)

1828
01:02:25,160 --> 01:02:28,828
As he obtained "chi", the race will stop temporarily.

1829
01:02:28,829 --> 01:02:31,304
(They stop for 10 seconds.)

1830
01:02:31,829 --> 01:02:33,069
Haha.

1831
01:02:33,070 --> 01:02:34,328
- How could you? - I'll do it.

1832
01:02:34,329 --> 01:02:35,328
- I'll keep my promise. - Wait.

1833
01:02:35,329 --> 01:02:36,868
I'll keep my promise.

1834
01:02:36,869 --> 01:02:38,498
- You promise? - I promise.

1835
01:02:38,499 --> 01:02:39,538
Keep your promise.

1836
01:02:39,539 --> 01:02:40,708
She's hiding.

1837
01:02:40,709 --> 01:02:42,514
(Is Haha doing well?)

1838
01:02:43,410 --> 01:02:44,938
I promised you, so trust me.

1839
01:02:44,939 --> 01:02:47,125
- I gave it to you out of trust. - I know.

1840
01:02:47,209 --> 01:02:48,625
I promise you.

1841
01:02:49,249 --> 01:02:51,955
(He laughs at those fools.)

1842
01:02:52,519 --> 01:02:56,094
In 10 seconds, the race starts again. 10.

1843
01:02:56,519 --> 01:02:58,118
Let's hurry and go up.

1844
01:02:58,119 --> 01:02:59,888
Jong Kook, shall we separate ways?

1845
01:02:59,889 --> 01:03:01,634
We can move together. It doesn't matter.

1846
01:03:01,930 --> 01:03:03,574
- Wait. - 10.

1847
01:03:03,829 --> 01:03:05,775
- You have to run away fast. - Why?

1848
01:03:05,829 --> 01:03:06,969
I'm powerless.

1849
01:03:06,970 --> 01:03:08,328
- Eight. - Keep quiet.

1850
01:03:08,329 --> 01:03:09,815
- Okay. - Seven.

1851
01:03:09,840 --> 01:03:12,138
Jong Kook, can you make Seok Jin be the last?

1852
01:03:12,139 --> 01:03:14,538
(The traitor approaches his predators.)

1853
01:03:14,539 --> 01:03:15,538
Okay.

1854
01:03:15,539 --> 01:03:18,038
- Okay. - Then I'll help you.

1855
01:03:18,039 --> 01:03:19,985
- Four. - Do you need me?

1856
01:03:20,079 --> 01:03:21,509
(Do you need me?)

1857
01:03:21,510 --> 01:03:23,355
(Look at him.)

1858
01:03:23,820 --> 01:03:25,319
(Temporary pause is over.)

1859
01:03:25,320 --> 01:03:27,388
- Temporary pause is over. - What do you need?

1860
01:03:27,389 --> 01:03:30,859
Wait a minute. Let's talk. What do you need?

1861
01:03:30,860 --> 01:03:32,864
(They attack him without saying anything.)

1862
01:03:33,329 --> 01:03:34,565
(Tearing)

1863
01:03:34,729 --> 01:03:37,129
(Jong Kook tears Haha's name tag.)

1864
01:03:37,130 --> 01:03:39,328
- I got it. - My goodness.

1865
01:03:39,329 --> 01:03:40,899
(What traitor Haha says)

1866
01:03:40,900 --> 01:03:42,804
My goodness.

1867
01:03:42,939 --> 01:03:44,168
He got his taken so easily.

1868
01:03:44,169 --> 01:03:45,399
(That's unbelievable.)

1869
01:03:45,400 --> 01:03:46,668
It's because he was alone.

1870
01:03:46,669 --> 01:03:48,708
Okay, I'll take "dong".

1871
01:03:48,709 --> 01:03:50,679
(He obtains "dong" from Dong Hoon's name tag.)

1872
01:03:50,680 --> 01:03:52,014
(I was surprised by "dong" something.)

1873
01:03:52,180 --> 01:03:55,384
Gosh, that team is merciless.

1874
01:03:55,510 --> 01:03:56,848
Temporary pause is over.

1875
01:03:56,849 --> 01:03:58,879
- Five. - We need his name tag again, right?

1876
01:03:58,880 --> 01:04:00,888
- Yes, once more. - Don't we need "ha"?

1877
01:04:00,889 --> 01:04:02,819
Okay, let's go.

1878
01:04:02,820 --> 01:04:03,935
(They go after Haha again.)

1879
01:04:04,990 --> 01:04:07,205
Are they after us? Let watch this.

1880
01:04:08,760 --> 01:04:09,835
Wait.

1881
01:04:10,900 --> 01:04:12,159
(Hey, Seok Jin.)

1882
01:04:12,160 --> 01:04:13,429
- We need you. - Is it me?

1883
01:04:13,430 --> 01:04:15,328
- Yes. - Why is it me again?

1884
01:04:15,329 --> 01:04:16,899
(Is it me?)

1885
01:04:16,900 --> 01:04:18,438
(Why is it me again?)

1886
01:04:18,439 --> 01:04:20,138
Why is it me again?

1887
01:04:20,139 --> 01:04:22,145
(Traitor Haha gets his name tag taken again.)

1888
01:04:22,240 --> 01:04:23,638
Darn it.

1889
01:04:23,639 --> 01:04:24,909
(Darn it!)

1890
01:04:24,910 --> 01:04:26,779
What's wrong with you?

1891
01:04:26,780 --> 01:04:28,455
(Haha is very popular.)

1892
01:04:29,010 --> 01:04:30,779
(It's his second time.)

1893
01:04:30,780 --> 01:04:32,219
What's wrong with you?

1894
01:04:32,220 --> 01:04:34,719
- Temporary pause. - We want "ha".

1895
01:04:34,720 --> 01:04:36,864
(Team Yu Na gets "ha" from Haha.)

1896
01:04:37,059 --> 01:04:38,688
My goodness.

1897
01:04:38,689 --> 01:04:39,929
(He's in tatters.)

1898
01:04:39,930 --> 01:04:41,735
I'm so sad.

1899
01:04:43,300 --> 01:04:44,498
Please do the countdown.

1900
01:04:44,499 --> 01:04:46,744
- We have to go again. - 10.

1901
01:04:47,630 --> 01:04:49,598
Is it me again? No, right?

1902
01:04:49,599 --> 01:04:51,045
(There's no way.)

1903
01:04:52,200 --> 01:04:53,985
Where is So Min?

1904
01:04:54,639 --> 01:04:56,978
So Min.

1905
01:04:56,979 --> 01:04:58,839
Jae Seok, shall we go that way?

1906
01:04:58,840 --> 01:05:00,149
- Shall we? - So Min.

1907
01:05:00,150 --> 01:05:01,308
Shall we go around?

1908
01:05:01,309 --> 01:05:03,795
- We need to get at least one. - We do.

1909
01:05:04,019 --> 01:05:05,018
Hey.

1910
01:05:05,019 --> 01:05:06,819
We have "dong" and "ha".

1911
01:05:06,820 --> 01:05:08,065
- "Dong, ha". - Right.

1912
01:05:08,289 --> 01:05:10,034
Should we pretend to go after Jong Kook's?

1913
01:05:10,320 --> 01:05:12,464
Should we?

1914
01:05:12,519 --> 01:05:13,958
Yes, that would be better.

1915
01:05:13,959 --> 01:05:15,859
Haha's name has both letters?

1916
01:05:15,860 --> 01:05:17,205
(They approach them secretly.)

1917
01:05:17,959 --> 01:05:20,605
(Chi Yeul's plan starts.)

1918
01:05:21,970 --> 01:05:24,045
(He approaches Jong Kook.)

1919
01:05:24,139 --> 01:05:27,239
- Wait a minute. - Go away.

1920
01:05:27,240 --> 01:05:31,014
(As planned, Chi Yeul attacks Jong Kook.)

1921
01:05:31,910 --> 01:05:33,455
(He's after Jong Kook.)

1922
01:05:33,780 --> 01:05:36,518
(Se Chan is vulnerable.)

1923
01:05:36,519 --> 01:05:37,918
(Now is our chance.)

1924
01:05:37,919 --> 01:05:40,288
- Wait. - We have to tear off Jong Kook's.

1925
01:05:40,289 --> 01:05:41,364
Jong Kook's.

1926
01:05:41,389 --> 01:05:43,835
(Their fake hunting starts.)

1927
01:05:44,019 --> 01:05:45,418
- Wait. - Tear it.

1928
01:05:45,419 --> 01:05:47,228
- Wait. - Tear it.

1929
01:05:47,229 --> 01:05:48,589
Be careful, Jong Kook.

1930
01:05:48,590 --> 01:05:50,705
(Two teams are facing each other.)

1931
01:05:51,099 --> 01:05:52,505
(Be careful, Jong Kook.)

1932
01:05:53,430 --> 01:05:55,304
(He catches him.)

1933
01:05:56,539 --> 01:05:59,038
(They steer their attention to Jong Kook.)

1934
01:05:59,039 --> 01:06:02,714
(He tears it off.)

1935
01:06:03,410 --> 01:06:05,014
(He first fakes him.)

1936
01:06:05,510 --> 01:06:08,384
I got it. Stop, stop, Jae Seok.

1937
01:06:08,849 --> 01:06:10,219
(Did they trick us?)

1938
01:06:10,220 --> 01:06:12,025
You should have been careful.

1939
01:06:12,220 --> 01:06:13,895
Which letter do you choose?

1940
01:06:14,019 --> 01:06:15,094
Are you talking to us?

1941
01:06:15,389 --> 01:06:16,518
- Which letter? - "Chan".

1942
01:06:16,519 --> 01:06:17,719
- "Chan". - "Chan"?

1943
01:06:17,720 --> 01:06:19,859
(They obtain "chan" from Se Chan's name tag.)

1944
01:06:19,860 --> 01:06:21,835
Pause.

1945
01:06:21,959 --> 01:06:23,429
We'll resume in 10 seconds.

1946
01:06:23,430 --> 01:06:24,429
Let's hurry.

1947
01:06:24,430 --> 01:06:25,899
- I'll do it. - 10.

1948
01:06:25,900 --> 01:06:27,728
Let's go first.

1949
01:06:27,729 --> 01:06:29,205
We have to meet up.

1950
01:06:29,229 --> 01:06:30,438
Eight.

1951
01:06:30,439 --> 01:06:31,899
(The remaining three teams are in a hurry.)

1952
01:06:31,900 --> 01:06:33,415
Hurry up.

1953
01:06:33,439 --> 01:06:34,915
They're almost done.

1954
01:06:35,439 --> 01:06:36,538
The letters...

1955
01:06:36,539 --> 01:06:37,538
(Team Chi Yeul only needs one more letter.)

1956
01:06:37,539 --> 01:06:39,784
Two, race starts.

1957
01:06:39,950 --> 01:06:41,379
- Me again? - Go that way.

1958
01:06:41,380 --> 01:06:42,685
Why is it me?

1959
01:06:43,220 --> 01:06:45,649
(As soon as the race resumes, they hunt down Haha.)

1960
01:06:45,650 --> 01:06:47,395
(Why is it me?)

1961
01:06:48,019 --> 01:06:49,518
Why me?

1962
01:06:49,519 --> 01:06:50,935
(Yes, it's you again.)

1963
01:06:51,959 --> 01:06:54,105
(We can say that we met in "Hadong".)

1964
01:06:54,889 --> 01:06:56,605
(That makes sense.)

1965
01:06:56,900 --> 01:06:59,404
(Let's take Haha's name tag three times.)

1966
01:06:59,630 --> 01:07:02,105
(Our goal is you.)

1967
01:07:02,570 --> 01:07:05,514
(Why? Why is it me?)

1968
01:07:05,900 --> 01:07:06,938
(What's going on over there?)

1969
01:07:06,939 --> 01:07:09,514
What? How many times is that?

1970
01:07:10,139 --> 01:07:11,438
Which letter do you want?

1971
01:07:11,439 --> 01:07:12,839
We'll take "dong".

1972
01:07:12,840 --> 01:07:13,848
- Okay. - You took it before.

1973
01:07:13,849 --> 01:07:15,955
- There's another one. We need it. - There's another one.

1974
01:07:16,519 --> 01:07:17,518
("I met my blind date in Hadong.")

1975
01:07:17,519 --> 01:07:20,025
(They complete Hadong with their second "dong".)

1976
01:07:20,090 --> 01:07:22,788
I thought about it, and I verified it.

1977
01:07:22,789 --> 01:07:23,888
It works.

1978
01:07:23,889 --> 01:07:26,605
She likes "fritters",

1979
01:07:26,689 --> 01:07:28,228
so her nickname is "Jeon".

1980
01:07:28,229 --> 01:07:30,529
"Jeon"? "She likes fritters, so her nickname is Jeon"?

1981
01:07:30,530 --> 01:07:31,859
- Is that possible? - Yes.

1982
01:07:31,860 --> 01:07:34,529
- We need So Min. - We have to tear hers twice.

1983
01:07:34,530 --> 01:07:36,129
Where's So Min?

1984
01:07:36,130 --> 01:07:37,574
You rip off her name tag, okay?

1985
01:07:37,700 --> 01:07:38,938
Come out, So Min.

1986
01:07:38,939 --> 01:07:40,708
(We need Jeon from So Min.)

1987
01:07:40,709 --> 01:07:41,938
She isn't here.

1988
01:07:41,939 --> 01:07:43,609
It might end while we look for her.

1989
01:07:43,610 --> 01:07:45,315
(Everyone's number 1 target is So Min.)

1990
01:07:46,010 --> 01:07:47,279
Where is So Min?

1991
01:07:47,280 --> 01:07:48,409
(Where is So Min?)

1992
01:07:48,410 --> 01:07:50,295
So Min!

1993
01:07:50,720 --> 01:07:51,924
(He yells her name.)

1994
01:07:53,119 --> 01:07:56,764
(It's like searching for Mr. Kim in the middle of Seoul.)

1995
01:07:57,619 --> 01:07:59,958
Stay hiding. I'll go out first.

1996
01:07:59,959 --> 01:08:03,529
If I don't come back,

1997
01:08:03,530 --> 01:08:05,659
you should run away secretly.

1998
01:08:05,660 --> 01:08:07,105
(So Min goes to see what's going on.)

1999
01:08:07,329 --> 01:08:08,605
(Will it be okay?)

2000
01:08:09,840 --> 01:08:11,899
(Moving quietly)

2001
01:08:11,900 --> 01:08:14,339
(She doesn't know that she's everyone's target.)

2002
01:08:14,340 --> 01:08:18,208
(She moves carefully towards the group.)

2003
01:08:18,209 --> 01:08:19,848
- 10. - You rip off her name tag.

2004
01:08:19,849 --> 01:08:21,754
- Nine. - Where is she?

2005
01:08:23,519 --> 01:08:28,119
(When everyone is looking for So Min)

2006
01:08:28,120 --> 01:08:30,264
- Hey. - There she is!

2007
01:08:31,160 --> 01:08:33,088
(I told you to stay hidden.)

2008
01:08:33,089 --> 01:08:34,264
Let's go and catch her.

2009
01:08:34,290 --> 01:08:35,388
Don't get caught!

2010
01:08:35,389 --> 01:08:36,798
(Team Yu Na begins the hunt.)

2011
01:08:36,799 --> 01:08:39,374
(Are they coming after me?)

2012
01:08:40,570 --> 01:08:41,628
Why me?

2013
01:08:41,629 --> 01:08:42,945
You fool!

2014
01:08:43,370 --> 01:08:45,975
(She instantly becomes prey after coming out of hiding.)

2015
01:08:46,769 --> 01:08:49,714
Why are they coming after me?

2016
01:08:50,379 --> 01:08:52,615
(Stop right there, Jeon So Min.)

2017
01:08:52,780 --> 01:08:55,084
(They run after her.)

2018
01:08:55,849 --> 01:08:58,454
(My legs, save me.)

2019
01:08:59,920 --> 01:09:03,895
(While giving chase, Se Chan takes a different route.)

2020
01:09:04,759 --> 01:09:08,388
(I got you!)

2021
01:09:08,389 --> 01:09:10,334
Haha! Haha!

2022
01:09:11,360 --> 01:09:15,105
(So Min gets cornered.)

2023
01:09:15,729 --> 01:09:16,945
Haha!

2024
01:09:17,200 --> 01:09:18,699
(You didn't know I could do this.)

2025
01:09:18,700 --> 01:09:20,584
Haha!

2026
01:09:21,570 --> 01:09:22,638
Haha!

2027
01:09:22,639 --> 01:09:24,438
- Come here. - Why are you doing this?

2028
01:09:24,439 --> 01:09:25,985
- Why are you doing this? - Rip off her name tag.

2029
01:09:26,240 --> 01:09:28,209
(Haha joins the group.)

2030
01:09:28,210 --> 01:09:30,619
(Will she get her name tag ripped off?)

2031
01:09:30,620 --> 01:09:33,054
- Which letter do you need? - Rip off her name tag.

2032
01:09:35,049 --> 01:09:36,464
Okay!

2033
01:09:36,719 --> 01:09:39,859
(Yu Na succeeds in ripping off her name tag.)

2034
01:09:39,860 --> 01:09:41,628
- I should have held out. - I came this way.

2035
01:09:41,629 --> 01:09:43,834
- Good job. - I got mine ripped off three times.

2036
01:09:44,559 --> 01:09:46,334
I came out because you were nowhere to be seen.

2037
01:09:47,099 --> 01:09:49,105
- We will take "Jeon". - Why do you need "Jeon"?

2038
01:09:49,629 --> 01:09:51,214
- "I met my date..." - "I met my date..."

2039
01:09:51,599 --> 01:09:53,709
- "at Hadong..." - "at Hadong..."

2040
01:09:53,710 --> 01:09:55,615
"and became surprised since she resembled a coin."

2041
01:09:55,910 --> 01:09:59,655
Jong Kook's team has completed the first sentence.

2042
01:09:59,879 --> 01:10:02,008
- But you are still in the game. - We know.

2043
01:10:02,009 --> 01:10:03,655
- Help us. - What do you need?

2044
01:10:03,719 --> 01:10:05,678
- Who do you need? - We need...

2045
01:10:05,679 --> 01:10:08,065
Kwang Soo and either Seok Jin or Jae Seok.

2046
01:10:08,089 --> 01:10:09,218
Okay.

2047
01:10:09,219 --> 01:10:10,565
- We will catch them. - We will catch them.

2048
01:10:10,589 --> 01:10:11,764
Thank you.

2049
01:10:12,019 --> 01:10:13,405
Mina should come out now.

2050
01:10:13,629 --> 01:10:16,605
(The current status of the sentences)

2051
01:10:16,759 --> 01:10:19,834
Jeon Seo Min. There she is.

2052
01:10:20,469 --> 01:10:22,445
Jeon So Min. Let's rip off her name tag twice.

2053
01:10:22,830 --> 01:10:24,945
There is Seok Jin.

2054
01:10:25,700 --> 01:10:27,014
Let's join forces.

2055
01:10:27,309 --> 01:10:28,485
We can't do this by ourselves.

2056
01:10:28,639 --> 01:10:30,514
- We need "Chi". - We need "Chi" too.

2057
01:10:31,339 --> 01:10:33,909
- You need a letter from us, right? - It seems that way.

2058
01:10:33,910 --> 01:10:35,878
- Do you need a letter from us? - We are done.

2059
01:10:35,879 --> 01:10:36,978
What do you mean?

2060
01:10:36,979 --> 01:10:38,348
- Are you done? Then help us. - We are done.

2061
01:10:38,349 --> 01:10:40,065
(Haha and So Min attack first.)

2062
01:10:40,420 --> 01:10:42,218
(Team Yu Na helps Team Mina as promised.)

2063
01:10:42,219 --> 01:10:45,619
- Are you done? Then help us. - We are done.

2064
01:10:45,620 --> 01:10:48,164
Come on. Help us.

2065
01:10:48,189 --> 01:10:49,489
Rip off his name tag.

2066
01:10:49,490 --> 01:10:52,499
(It's 2 against 1.)

2067
01:10:52,500 --> 01:10:53,999
Haha! Haha! Hurry up!

2068
01:10:54,000 --> 01:10:57,438
(Haha grabs the name tag.)

2069
01:10:57,439 --> 01:10:58,899
Haha, hurry up and rip it off.

2070
01:10:58,900 --> 01:10:59,968
- Rip it off. - He ripped it off.

2071
01:10:59,969 --> 01:11:03,714
(Seok Jin rips off a name tag first.)

2072
01:11:04,839 --> 01:11:05,838
- Rip it off. - He ripped it off.

2073
01:11:05,839 --> 01:11:07,054
- All right. - I ripped it off.

2074
01:11:07,650 --> 01:11:09,124
How could you fail?

2075
01:11:09,650 --> 01:11:11,594
- Gosh, it hurts. - How could you fail?

2076
01:11:11,620 --> 01:11:13,548
- Are you okay? - Game is on pause.

2077
01:11:13,549 --> 01:11:15,264
- Game is on pause. - For goodness' sake.

2078
01:11:15,290 --> 01:11:16,895
Everyone is over there.

2079
01:11:18,719 --> 01:11:19,758
"Jeon".

2080
01:11:19,759 --> 01:11:23,035
(Seok Jin gets "Jeon".)

2081
01:11:23,700 --> 01:11:26,134
We just need to rip off So Min's name tag once more.

2082
01:11:27,599 --> 01:11:28,628
Haha.

2083
01:11:28,629 --> 01:11:32,145
(This team's target is So Min too.)

2084
01:11:32,370 --> 01:11:33,909
(We need Kwang Soo.)

2085
01:11:33,910 --> 01:11:36,308
When you run into Kwang Soo, use yourself as bait...

2086
01:11:36,309 --> 01:11:37,514
and rip off his name tag.

2087
01:11:37,740 --> 01:11:39,454
He might rip off my name tag first.

2088
01:11:39,710 --> 01:11:41,378
- We need to avoid placing last. - Haha.

2089
01:11:41,379 --> 01:11:43,279
(The two teams meet.)

2090
01:11:43,280 --> 01:11:44,518
What?

2091
01:11:44,519 --> 01:11:45,779
I will give you my name tag.

2092
01:11:45,780 --> 01:11:47,319
- We made a deal earlier. - When did we do that?

2093
01:11:47,320 --> 01:11:49,725
We made a deal earlier.

2094
01:11:50,360 --> 01:11:52,594
Haha! Haha!

2095
01:11:52,620 --> 01:11:54,628
- Haha! - Rip off the name tag first.

2096
01:11:54,629 --> 01:11:57,199
(Rip off the name tag first to get a letter.)

2097
01:11:57,200 --> 01:11:58,499
(It's 2 against 2.)

2098
01:11:58,500 --> 01:11:59,968
- Haha! - Rip off the name tag first.

2099
01:11:59,969 --> 01:12:02,228
- Me? Me? - No, no.

2100
01:12:02,229 --> 01:12:04,539
I didn't get my name tag ripped off.

2101
01:12:04,540 --> 01:12:07,308
(So Min protects her name tag and Haha and Mina attack.)

2102
01:12:07,309 --> 01:12:10,514
(It's the final match between the two teams.)

2103
01:12:10,839 --> 01:12:13,279
(Whose name tag will come off first?)

2104
01:12:13,280 --> 01:12:15,685
(So Min's or Kwang Soo's?)

2105
01:12:16,379 --> 01:12:17,749
I didn't get my name tag ripped off.

2106
01:12:17,750 --> 01:12:18,848
- I did it! - I ripped it off!

2107
01:12:18,849 --> 01:12:21,449
(Did they rip off the name tags at the same time?)

2108
01:12:21,450 --> 01:12:23,065
- I did it! - I ripped it off!

2109
01:12:24,120 --> 01:12:27,228
- I did it! - I ripped it off!

2110
01:12:27,229 --> 01:12:28,565
Rock-paper-scissors.

2111
01:12:28,929 --> 01:12:30,035
Gosh, I did it first.

2112
01:12:30,129 --> 01:12:32,134
You need to win. You need to win.

2113
01:12:32,160 --> 01:12:33,329
- Rock-paper-scissors. - I will go.

2114
01:12:33,330 --> 01:12:34,499
Mina, are you good at rock-paper-scissors?

2115
01:12:34,500 --> 01:12:36,645
- One round. - Hold on.

2116
01:12:36,670 --> 01:12:38,338
- Come on. - Men pick rock!

2117
01:12:38,339 --> 01:12:39,815
(It's a psychological attack.)

2118
01:12:40,439 --> 01:12:42,285
(Chi Yeul, please win.)

2119
01:12:42,710 --> 01:12:44,878
(What will be the result?)

2120
01:12:44,879 --> 01:12:46,454
Men pick rock! Rock-paper-scissors!

2121
01:12:46,639 --> 01:12:48,878
(Rock versus Scissors)

2122
01:12:48,879 --> 01:12:50,249
Okay!

2123
01:12:50,250 --> 01:12:52,525
(We won!)

2124
01:12:53,280 --> 01:12:55,195
(For goodness' sake.)

2125
01:12:56,719 --> 01:12:58,834
Did he play scissors? Is he a fool?

2126
01:12:58,990 --> 01:13:00,829
- Is he a fool? - What a loser!

2127
01:13:00,830 --> 01:13:02,035
Chi Yeul, you are a loser.

2128
01:13:02,429 --> 01:13:03,634
What a loser!

2129
01:13:03,929 --> 01:13:05,428
Which letter would you like?

2130
01:13:05,429 --> 01:13:06,945
- We want "Lee". - "Lee".

2131
01:13:07,229 --> 01:13:08,374
- "Lee". - Yes.

2132
01:13:08,400 --> 01:13:09,804
You got "Lee".

2133
01:13:09,870 --> 01:13:11,044
Thank you.

2134
01:13:11,469 --> 01:13:14,315
(I like my lover's "teeth", but I hate my lover's "Blank".)

2135
01:13:14,339 --> 01:13:16,214
- Please count down. - 10.

2136
01:13:16,939 --> 01:13:18,638
- Seok Jin. - Seok Jin?

2137
01:13:18,639 --> 01:13:20,685
- We need Seok Jin. - Please protect So Min.

2138
01:13:20,710 --> 01:13:22,655
- We need So Min. - So Min.

2139
01:13:22,679 --> 01:13:24,478
- We need So Min. - Yes.

2140
01:13:24,479 --> 01:13:25,924
We need to get So Min.

2141
01:13:26,420 --> 01:13:28,048
So Min, run away.

2142
01:13:28,049 --> 01:13:30,195
If you protect So Min, they won't be able to win.

2143
01:13:30,790 --> 01:13:31,888
Where should I go?

2144
01:13:31,889 --> 01:13:33,164
(Let's hide.)

2145
01:13:33,790 --> 01:13:35,289
- Jeon So Min. Jeon So Min. - So Min.

2146
01:13:35,290 --> 01:13:36,489
- So Min. - So Min.

2147
01:13:36,490 --> 01:13:38,798
- So Min is running away. - Hey.

2148
01:13:38,799 --> 01:13:40,128
Let's go. Let's join them.

2149
01:13:40,129 --> 01:13:41,699
We need to rip off her name tag.

2150
01:13:41,700 --> 01:13:43,975
(It's a matter of who catches So Min first.)

2151
01:13:44,799 --> 01:13:46,575
Haha promised to hand So Min over.

2152
01:13:46,740 --> 01:13:48,315
- Haha promised. - Are you sure about that?

2153
01:13:48,339 --> 01:13:49,638
Come on.

2154
01:13:49,639 --> 01:13:51,539
- We got it! - We got it!

2155
01:13:51,540 --> 01:13:52,985
- Are you sure about that? - Come on.

2156
01:13:53,379 --> 01:13:54,779
- We got it! - We got it!

2157
01:13:54,780 --> 01:13:56,995
(Kwang Soo ripped off Jong Kook's name tag.)

2158
01:13:57,280 --> 01:13:59,119
- Jae Seok! - What was that?

2159
01:13:59,120 --> 01:14:00,365
Jae Seok!

2160
01:14:00,519 --> 01:14:02,218
(They changed the target to Jong Kook.)

2161
01:14:02,219 --> 01:14:04,464
- Which letter would you like? - "Kook"!

2162
01:14:04,490 --> 01:14:05,489
Did you rip it off?

2163
01:14:05,490 --> 01:14:06,758
- "Kook"! - "Kook"!

2164
01:14:06,759 --> 01:14:08,628
(We got "Kook"!)

2165
01:14:08,629 --> 01:14:09,728
Let's complete the sentence.

2166
01:14:09,729 --> 01:14:11,098
(Team Chi Yeul got "Kook" instead of "Jeon".)

2167
01:14:11,099 --> 01:14:12,775
"There was no side dish for the date..."

2168
01:14:13,000 --> 01:14:14,369
(Did they complete the sentence?)

2169
01:14:14,370 --> 01:14:15,869
"There was no side dish for the date,"

2170
01:14:15,870 --> 01:14:17,145
- "so I borrowed soup." - "So I borrowed soup."

2171
01:14:18,639 --> 01:14:20,369
- We will accept that. - Okay!

2172
01:14:20,370 --> 01:14:21,968
(They successfully complete the sentence.)

2173
01:14:21,969 --> 01:14:24,014
(We came in 2nd!)

2174
01:14:24,509 --> 01:14:26,384
Now, it's a match to decide who comes in last.

2175
01:14:27,150 --> 01:14:28,384
Where is she?

2176
01:14:28,710 --> 01:14:29,749
Where is So Min?

2177
01:14:29,750 --> 01:14:31,094
(The first team to acquire a letter will avoid placing last.)

2178
01:14:31,479 --> 01:14:34,065
(Team Tiffany's target is So Min.)

2179
01:14:34,820 --> 01:14:35,949
Let's go.

2180
01:14:35,950 --> 01:14:37,334
(We just need "Seok".)

2181
01:14:37,620 --> 01:14:39,334
Start! Congratulations.

2182
01:14:40,429 --> 01:14:43,134
It's incredible that you used only two letters.

2183
01:14:43,160 --> 01:14:45,374
- I am disappointed in you. - Haha.

2184
01:14:45,799 --> 01:14:47,174
You didn't keep your promise.

2185
01:14:47,229 --> 01:14:48,298
I am sorry,

2186
01:14:48,299 --> 01:14:49,968
but would you help me so that I won't place last?

2187
01:14:49,969 --> 01:14:51,239
What do you want me to do?

2188
01:14:51,240 --> 01:14:54,714
- If your team wins... - What do you need?

2189
01:14:54,939 --> 01:14:55,938
What do you need?

2190
01:14:55,939 --> 01:14:57,338
Me? I need Jae Seok.

2191
01:14:57,339 --> 01:14:59,138
(I need Jae Seok.)

2192
01:14:59,139 --> 01:15:00,348
- Hold on. - We can't give you his name tag.

2193
01:15:00,349 --> 01:15:01,409
Hold on.

2194
01:15:01,410 --> 01:15:02,949
- You can't do this. - You can't do this.

2195
01:15:02,950 --> 01:15:04,478
(Jong Kook continues to help his ally.)

2196
01:15:04,479 --> 01:15:07,294
(Will they acquire "Seok"?)

2197
01:15:08,420 --> 01:15:10,164
Jeon So Min! Where is she?

2198
01:15:10,860 --> 01:15:12,035
Where is she?

2199
01:15:12,559 --> 01:15:13,704
She disappeared.

2200
01:15:14,360 --> 01:15:17,304
Focus on her name tag no matter what.

2201
01:15:19,030 --> 01:15:20,499
(She was right in front of them.)

2202
01:15:20,500 --> 01:15:21,899
My goodness.

2203
01:15:21,900 --> 01:15:23,798
(It seems like they didn't see her.)

2204
01:15:23,799 --> 01:15:26,145
The three of them are together.

2205
01:15:26,200 --> 01:15:28,069
- You can't do this. - You can't do this.

2206
01:15:28,070 --> 01:15:29,239
Come on.

2207
01:15:29,240 --> 01:15:30,954
- You can't do this. - Let go of me.

2208
01:15:31,040 --> 01:15:33,185
- You can't do this. - Let go of me.

2209
01:15:33,280 --> 01:15:35,109
(Right then)

2210
01:15:35,110 --> 01:15:38,579
(Team Mina just needs "Seok".)

2211
01:15:38,580 --> 01:15:43,088
(Will they acquire the letter before Team Tiffany?)

2212
01:15:43,089 --> 01:15:44,258
I got it! I got it!

2213
01:15:44,259 --> 01:15:46,495
(Haha ripped off the name tag!)

2214
01:15:46,719 --> 01:15:48,388
- I got it! I got it! - You can't do this.

2215
01:15:48,389 --> 01:15:51,435
(They succeeded to acquire the last letter first.)

2216
01:15:53,099 --> 01:15:54,169
(I can't believe I handed over the name tag like this.)

2217
01:15:54,170 --> 01:15:55,544
I got it! I got it!

2218
01:15:55,570 --> 01:15:56,844
You can't do this.

2219
01:15:57,040 --> 01:15:58,975
- What was that? - Look at...

2220
01:15:59,439 --> 01:16:01,714
- What was that? - Look at Seok Jin's face.

2221
01:16:01,969 --> 01:16:04,155
How could you hand over your name tag like that?

2222
01:16:04,339 --> 01:16:05,985
Which letter would you like?

2223
01:16:06,179 --> 01:16:07,884
- "Seok". - "Seok".

2224
01:16:07,910 --> 01:16:09,685
"Seok". Please complete the sentence.

2225
01:16:09,879 --> 01:16:12,395
"I like my lover's teeth,"

2226
01:16:12,519 --> 01:16:15,164
"but I hate my lover's plaque."

2227
01:16:15,889 --> 01:16:16,919
We will accept it.

2228
01:16:16,920 --> 01:16:18,518
(They completed the sentence as they planned.)

2229
01:16:18,519 --> 01:16:19,834
It was perfect.

2230
01:16:20,259 --> 01:16:22,334
- Does that mean we placed last? - Yes.

2231
01:16:22,629 --> 01:16:25,199
- So Min! - Yes?

2232
01:16:25,200 --> 01:16:26,329
(So Min shows up belatedly.)

2233
01:16:26,330 --> 01:16:27,329
Where were you?

2234
01:16:27,330 --> 01:16:29,029
She hid from us.

2235
01:16:29,030 --> 01:16:31,115
Thank goodness you hid from them.

2236
01:16:31,299 --> 01:16:32,445
Thank goodness.

2237
01:16:32,599 --> 01:16:33,808
Do we need to peel persimmons?

2238
01:16:33,809 --> 01:16:35,008
There is the last step.

2239
01:16:35,009 --> 01:16:36,508
(It's time to decide which team places last.)

2240
01:16:36,509 --> 01:16:38,638
So Min, you ran away so diligently.

2241
01:16:38,639 --> 01:16:39,785
Good job, So Min.

2242
01:16:40,080 --> 01:16:41,754
Please bring in the persimmon badge trees.

2243
01:16:42,009 --> 01:16:45,554
The top three teams will choose the tree.

2244
01:16:46,019 --> 01:16:48,794
You can choose 1 of the 5 persimmon trees.

2245
01:16:48,820 --> 01:16:51,018
The persimmon badges will be divided equally...

2246
01:16:51,019 --> 01:16:53,664
among the members who choose the same persimmon tree.

2247
01:16:53,960 --> 01:16:55,365
You play as a team and for yourself.

2248
01:16:55,389 --> 01:16:59,235
If 1 member chooses number 1, he or she will get 20 badges.

2249
01:16:59,259 --> 01:17:03,145
If more members choose it, they will get zero badges.

2250
01:17:05,700 --> 01:17:07,008
(Persimmon tree number 1 is important.)

2251
01:17:07,009 --> 01:17:10,245
The team that placed last will guess which tree will be...

2252
01:17:10,439 --> 01:17:11,938
the most popular.

2253
01:17:11,939 --> 01:17:12,978
We have six badges.

2254
01:17:12,979 --> 01:17:14,949
You might have more badges than us after this.

2255
01:17:14,950 --> 01:17:17,124
If a member of Team Mina gets all the badges of number one...

2256
01:17:17,219 --> 01:17:19,878
Would you let us have number one?

2257
01:17:19,879 --> 01:17:22,794
(Speaking politely)

2258
01:17:22,820 --> 01:17:24,264
- All right. - Number one.

2259
01:17:24,620 --> 01:17:26,359
Pick me, pick me, pick me up

2260
01:17:26,360 --> 01:17:28,329
(Pick me, pick me, pick me up.)

2261
01:17:28,330 --> 01:17:29,859
(We need to do something too.)

2262
01:17:29,860 --> 01:17:32,258
- We are Gangnam "mo-yang-sae". - Gangnam "mo-yang-sae"

2263
01:17:32,259 --> 01:17:33,768
Sexy woman

2264
01:17:33,769 --> 01:17:36,268
(Singing)

2265
01:17:36,269 --> 01:17:37,598
Sexy woman

2266
01:17:37,599 --> 01:17:39,069
(The two teams at the bottom act cute to avoid losing.)

2267
01:17:39,070 --> 01:17:40,239
This is bad. I don't know what to do.

2268
01:17:40,240 --> 01:17:41,645
I don't know what to do.

2269
01:17:42,939 --> 01:17:46,054
(The four teams think hard before making the last choice.)

2270
01:17:46,540 --> 01:17:48,685
We don't need to put ourselves at risk.

2271
01:17:48,849 --> 01:17:50,478
- Let's stay safe. - Number 3 or 4.

2272
01:17:50,479 --> 01:17:51,655
Number 2, 3, or 4.

2273
01:17:51,849 --> 01:17:53,848
Multiple people will choose number one.

2274
01:17:53,849 --> 01:17:55,264
- Is anyone choosing number 1? - Number 2, 3, or 4.

2275
01:17:55,349 --> 01:17:56,594
I can't tell you that.

2276
01:17:56,849 --> 01:17:58,435
Let's go. Number five.

2277
01:17:59,219 --> 01:18:00,504
Number five was chosen by...

2278
01:18:01,290 --> 01:18:02,558
(Number 5 has 4 badges.)

2279
01:18:02,559 --> 01:18:06,935
- one person, Lee Kwang Soo. - Okay!

2280
01:18:07,500 --> 01:18:08,768
- Okay. - I knew it!

2281
01:18:08,769 --> 01:18:10,004
- Let's go. - This is good.

2282
01:18:10,070 --> 01:18:12,069
Kwang Soo didn't choose number one!

2283
01:18:12,070 --> 01:18:13,315
Kwang Soo didn't choose number one!

2284
01:18:13,469 --> 01:18:14,838
Thank goodness I didn't choose number five.

2285
01:18:14,839 --> 01:18:15,968
I almost chose it.

2286
01:18:15,969 --> 01:18:18,338
- This is good. Let's go up. - Let's go up.

2287
01:18:18,339 --> 01:18:19,554
- Let's go. - Number four...

2288
01:18:19,639 --> 01:18:21,355
with six badges was chosen by...

2289
01:18:22,080 --> 01:18:23,249
one member, Park Yu Na.

2290
01:18:23,250 --> 01:18:25,355
(Number 4 with 6 badges was chosen by Yu Na.)

2291
01:18:25,379 --> 01:18:27,289
- How are you so good at this? - That's incredible.

2292
01:18:27,290 --> 01:18:28,588
How are you so good at this?

2293
01:18:28,589 --> 01:18:30,819
- Goodness. - How could she?

2294
01:18:30,820 --> 01:18:32,119
- I know. - She turned the tables around.

2295
01:18:32,120 --> 01:18:33,728
Good job.

2296
01:18:33,729 --> 01:18:34,928
Yu Na.

2297
01:18:34,929 --> 01:18:36,228
Number three.

2298
01:18:36,229 --> 01:18:39,634
Number 3 with 8 persimmon badges...

2299
01:18:39,830 --> 01:18:41,275
I hope that it's only two.

2300
01:18:42,129 --> 01:18:44,098
was picked by three people, Jong Kook, Haha, and Chi Yeul.

2301
01:18:44,099 --> 01:18:45,968
(Three people pick tree number 3.)

2302
01:18:45,969 --> 01:18:47,414
Okay, it's okay.

2303
01:18:47,639 --> 01:18:49,739
3 to 3 to 2. 1 person gets 2.

2304
01:18:49,740 --> 01:18:51,508
- Let's play rock-paper-scissors. - 1 person gets 2.

2305
01:18:51,509 --> 01:18:52,779
It's better to take three.

2306
01:18:52,780 --> 01:18:53,848
Rock-paper-scissors

2307
01:18:53,849 --> 01:18:55,109
- Okay. - Haha.

2308
01:18:55,110 --> 01:18:58,079
(Haha wins and gets 3 persimmon badges.)

2309
01:18:58,080 --> 01:18:59,819
(Team Yu Na wins three more.)

2310
01:18:59,820 --> 01:19:01,995
- Rock-paper-scissors - Rock-paper-scissors

2311
01:19:02,150 --> 01:19:03,624
Men play rock.

2312
01:19:03,650 --> 01:19:05,419
I don't know how it'll turn out.

2313
01:19:05,420 --> 01:19:07,464
There are four of you left.

2314
01:19:07,559 --> 01:19:08,789
Number two.

2315
01:19:08,790 --> 01:19:09,859
(4 members and 2 persimmon trees remain.)

2316
01:19:09,860 --> 01:19:11,399
Those who picked 10.

2317
01:19:11,400 --> 01:19:13,098
It's over if everyone picked number two.

2318
01:19:13,099 --> 01:19:14,128
(Number 2 has 10 persimmon badges.)

2319
01:19:14,129 --> 01:19:16,069
Jae Seok, Mina, and Se Chan.

2320
01:19:16,070 --> 01:19:18,669
(3 people picked number 2 tree.)

2321
01:19:18,670 --> 01:19:20,569
(Only So Min remains.)

2322
01:19:20,570 --> 01:19:21,638
So Min.

2323
01:19:21,639 --> 01:19:23,109
So Min picked number one.

2324
01:19:23,110 --> 01:19:25,815
(She takes 20 persimmon badges.)

2325
01:19:26,009 --> 01:19:29,449
(This is amazing.)

2326
01:19:29,450 --> 01:19:30,518
(Team Mina gets 20 more.)

2327
01:19:30,519 --> 01:19:32,924
(How is this possible?)

2328
01:19:33,120 --> 01:19:34,949
Did no one pick number one?

2329
01:19:34,950 --> 01:19:36,348
- Did you not? - Why didn't you?

2330
01:19:36,349 --> 01:19:38,495
I definitely thought that you picked it.

2331
01:19:39,189 --> 01:19:40,959
- I thought too much. - What's your place?

2332
01:19:40,960 --> 01:19:42,058
We didn't place first.

2333
01:19:42,059 --> 01:19:43,388
- No. - It's not possible.

2334
01:19:43,389 --> 01:19:44,529
Goodness.

2335
01:19:44,530 --> 01:19:45,558
As a result,

2336
01:19:45,559 --> 01:19:47,374
the winner changed.

2337
01:19:48,070 --> 01:19:49,768
With a difference of one, the winner changed.

2338
01:19:49,769 --> 01:19:51,268
Team Mina won 32 badges.

2339
01:19:51,269 --> 01:19:52,798
(Team Mina turns the tables around.)

2340
01:19:52,799 --> 01:19:54,239
Team Yu Na won 31 badges.

2341
01:19:54,240 --> 01:19:55,268
- We did? - 31 badges.

2342
01:19:55,269 --> 01:19:56,338
We won so many.

2343
01:19:56,339 --> 01:19:58,185
You won 31 badges, and they won 32.

2344
01:19:58,410 --> 01:20:00,548
(We can't believe that we won.)

2345
01:20:00,549 --> 01:20:03,124
Congratulations. Team Tiffany placed last with 21 badges.

2346
01:20:03,349 --> 01:20:06,449
The one with the most badges in the winning team gets...

2347
01:20:06,450 --> 01:20:08,919
- to register her handwriting. - That's amazing.

2348
01:20:08,920 --> 01:20:12,159
So Min will register her handwriting.

2349
01:20:12,160 --> 01:20:13,659
(So Min gets to register her handwriting.)

2350
01:20:13,660 --> 01:20:15,029
Congratulations.

2351
01:20:15,030 --> 01:20:16,464
I'm about to cry.

2352
01:20:16,530 --> 01:20:17,758
You're the winner.

2353
01:20:17,759 --> 01:20:20,428
- Life can change in one go. - You're impressive, So Min.

2354
01:20:20,429 --> 01:20:21,499
I'm about to cry.

2355
01:20:21,500 --> 01:20:23,669
So Min might make her debut as a writer.

2356
01:20:23,670 --> 01:20:25,445
Yes, it might be soon.

2357
01:20:25,700 --> 01:20:27,938
College reports can be written in So Min's handwriting.

2358
01:20:27,939 --> 01:20:28,938
Really?

2359
01:20:28,939 --> 01:20:30,539
Team Mina won.

2360
01:20:30,540 --> 01:20:31,878
(The final winner is Team Mina.)

2361
01:20:31,879 --> 01:20:34,409
Except for those to be penalized, you may go home.

2362
01:20:34,410 --> 01:20:35,978
- Thank you for your work. - Good job.

2363
01:20:35,979 --> 01:20:38,054
- Thank you. - Thank you.

2364
01:20:38,120 --> 01:20:39,119
(There are 100 persimmons.)

2365
01:20:39,120 --> 01:20:40,949
- Seriously. - It's a mess.

2366
01:20:40,950 --> 01:20:43,018
I didn't think that I'd be penalized.

2367
01:20:43,019 --> 01:20:45,888
I'll think that both of you helped me be on TV longer.

2368
01:20:45,889 --> 01:20:48,859
Yes, when else would you peel persimmons?

2369
01:20:48,860 --> 01:20:50,128
- Right. - I can't believe I'm peeling them.

2370
01:20:50,129 --> 01:20:53,029
You can't peel persimmons when you're in the US.

2371
01:20:53,030 --> 01:20:54,174
You're right.

2372
01:20:54,269 --> 01:20:56,899
I didn't know that I had such a talent.

2373
01:20:56,900 --> 01:20:58,174
Look at how I peeled it.

2374
01:20:58,540 --> 01:21:00,098
- Isn't it pretty? - It's very pretty.

2375
01:21:00,099 --> 01:21:01,138
It's so pretty.

2376
01:21:01,139 --> 01:21:03,315
We might finish before So Min.

2377
01:21:04,110 --> 01:21:05,579
This is a penalty.

2378
01:21:05,580 --> 01:21:08,178
I didn't know that I had to study the rest.

2379
01:21:08,179 --> 01:21:10,924
What I wanted was to go home early.

2380
01:21:11,120 --> 01:21:12,279
That's funny.

2381
01:21:12,280 --> 01:21:13,888
You shouldn't write carelessly.

2382
01:21:13,889 --> 01:21:16,048
That's the charm of handwriting.

2383
01:21:16,049 --> 01:21:17,758
I think we're at 100. How many are there?

2384
01:21:17,759 --> 01:21:18,819
I'll count.

2385
01:21:18,820 --> 01:21:20,628
- 99. - 99.

2386
01:21:20,629 --> 01:21:21,704
- 100. - 100.

2387
01:21:21,889 --> 01:21:23,029
Success.

2388
01:21:23,030 --> 01:21:25,128
Three of you who have finished the penalty...

2389
01:21:25,129 --> 01:21:26,735
- may go home. - Okay.

2390
01:21:26,900 --> 01:21:28,069
So Min.

2391
01:21:28,070 --> 01:21:30,844
- See you. - Being the winner isn't good.

2392
01:21:31,269 --> 01:21:33,315
I still have a lot left.

2393
01:21:33,439 --> 01:21:35,315
- Thank you. - Okay.

2394
01:21:35,670 --> 01:21:37,069
1, 2, 3.

2395
01:21:37,070 --> 01:21:38,239
Thank you for your work.

2396
01:21:38,240 --> 01:21:40,924
- How did I write L? - Good job.

2397
01:21:41,080 --> 01:21:43,348
Make sure to fill the blanks.

2398
01:21:43,349 --> 01:21:44,525
Wait,

2399
01:21:44,549 --> 01:21:46,124
I'm the winner.

2400
01:21:53,460 --> 01:21:56,735
(A tour of tasty restaurants with Jong Kook)

2401
01:21:56,889 --> 01:21:59,075
(Stir-fried sundae)

2402
01:21:59,160 --> 01:22:01,344
(While they're set on going to the tasty restaurant,)

2403
01:22:02,200 --> 01:22:04,414
(something happened.)

2404
01:22:05,469 --> 01:22:07,745
(Those who run away all of a sudden)

2405
01:22:08,070 --> 01:22:10,138
(Those who can't get caught)

2406
01:22:10,139 --> 01:22:11,808
(One who is after them)

2407
01:22:11,809 --> 01:22:12,884
(Get down.)

2408
01:22:13,580 --> 01:22:16,285
(If they're careless for a moment,)

2409
01:22:16,679 --> 01:22:19,518
(everything will disappear.)

2410
01:22:19,519 --> 01:22:21,495
(What will be the result of the chase?)

2411
01:22:21,920 --> 01:22:23,764
(What Happened in Anyang?)
