1
00:00:06,620 --> 00:00:08,619
(A cool autumn breeze and cool sculptures greet them...)

2
00:00:08,620 --> 00:00:10,058
(at Anyang Art Park.)

3
00:00:10,059 --> 00:00:11,528
- Hello. - Hi.

4
00:00:11,529 --> 00:00:12,898
Hi.

5
00:00:12,899 --> 00:00:14,958
- Hello. - Good morning. Sitting cushions.

6
00:00:14,959 --> 00:00:16,245
What's going on?

7
00:00:16,730 --> 00:00:18,645
Haha...

8
00:00:18,769 --> 00:00:21,374
- What's wrong with him? - He got a flat tire.

9
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:23,669
- Really? - He's changing the tire.

10
00:00:23,670 --> 00:00:24,969
- Really? - It's taking him some time.

11
00:00:24,970 --> 00:00:26,838
- It could've been bad. - I'm glad he's okay.

12
00:00:26,839 --> 00:00:28,879
He'll be here soon. He's almost here.

13
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:30,609
What about Seok Jin?

14
00:00:30,610 --> 00:00:32,849
- Seok Jin is already here. - I'm sorry.

15
00:00:32,850 --> 00:00:34,419
- Why? You didn't see me here? - I mean...

16
00:00:34,420 --> 00:00:35,949
- You're so mean. - What's wrong with you?

17
00:00:35,950 --> 00:00:37,048
It's a misunderstanding.

18
00:00:37,049 --> 00:00:38,724
I can't stand this.

19
00:00:39,319 --> 00:00:41,258
(You'll have to translate things like "cheer up" into Korean.)

20
00:00:41,259 --> 00:00:43,504
(You can look up the lyrics for 30 seconds before you sing.)

21
00:00:43,959 --> 00:00:45,934
(Seok Jin hadn't talked in a long time.)

22
00:00:46,029 --> 00:00:48,328
- Why did you have to cut in? - Why did you do that?

23
00:00:48,329 --> 00:00:50,745
(Feeling utterly disappointed)

24
00:00:50,969 --> 00:00:52,175
(Seok Jin is going to text me later.)

25
00:00:52,399 --> 00:00:54,315
(What do you think Chul Min's intention was?)

26
00:00:55,370 --> 00:00:58,538
(Since the last filming, Seok Jin has been disregarded a lot.)

27
00:00:58,539 --> 00:00:59,839
You just don't think about me, do you?

28
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:03,248
Does it mean the restructuring is around the corner in fall?

29
00:01:03,249 --> 00:01:04,248
(Is it time to change the cast?)

30
00:01:04,249 --> 00:01:06,995
- What did you say? - Is it supposed to be this obvious?

31
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:09,864
Are you giving us hints every week?

32
00:01:10,319 --> 00:01:11,749
- It's a misunderstanding. - He's pretending.

33
00:01:11,750 --> 00:01:13,418
- By the way, Seok Jin... - Just talk to me.

34
00:01:13,419 --> 00:01:15,118
- quit his radio program. - So I can look for other shows.

35
00:01:15,119 --> 00:01:16,489
- Really? - Really?

36
00:01:16,490 --> 00:01:18,159
- Yes. - I read the article.

37
00:01:18,160 --> 00:01:19,958
- Why did you quit? - Why did you?

38
00:01:19,959 --> 00:01:22,504
Well, I did enough for the show.

39
00:01:23,199 --> 00:01:24,529
Are you sure it was your decision to quit?

40
00:01:24,530 --> 00:01:26,215
(Are you sure it was your decision to quit?)

41
00:01:26,839 --> 00:01:28,499
- Really? You were fired? - Was it the restructuring?

42
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:29,784
Was it the restructuring?

43
00:01:29,839 --> 00:01:31,084
- You didn't quit? - Was it?

44
00:01:31,470 --> 00:01:33,838
- It's breaking my heart. - Seok Jin.

45
00:01:33,839 --> 00:01:35,939
- What are you talking about? - You got red in the face.

46
00:01:35,940 --> 00:01:37,549
- No, I didn't. - Seok Jin, let's grab a drink.

47
00:01:37,550 --> 00:01:39,779
I guess he really was let go.

48
00:01:39,780 --> 00:01:41,579
Why? I really liked the show.

49
00:01:41,580 --> 00:01:43,749
- Exactly. - Everyone.

50
00:01:43,750 --> 00:01:46,418
I gathered you here to give you a mission in advance.

51
00:01:46,419 --> 00:01:49,219
Jong Kook isn't here yet, and Haha is still working on his car.

52
00:01:49,220 --> 00:01:50,359
I'm supposed to give you...

53
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:52,235
- the mission without Jong Kook. - Really?

54
00:01:52,330 --> 00:01:53,834
(Without Jong Kook?)

55
00:01:54,229 --> 00:01:56,129
Today, we'll be pretending to go on a tour of...

56
00:01:56,130 --> 00:01:58,928
popular places in Anyang, chosen by Jong Kook, the son of Anyang.

57
00:01:58,929 --> 00:02:01,538
It's Find Kim Jong Kook Race.

58
00:02:01,539 --> 00:02:02,815
(Find Kim Jong Kook Race, a chase in Anyang)

59
00:02:03,039 --> 00:02:04,208
It's Find Kim Jong Kook Race.

60
00:02:04,209 --> 00:02:05,208
(Find Kim Jong Kook Race?)

61
00:02:05,209 --> 00:02:07,139
What is this about? "Find Kim Jong Kook Race"?

62
00:02:07,140 --> 00:02:09,409
There will be a cash prize of 3,000 dollars.

63
00:02:09,410 --> 00:02:11,724
(There will be a cash prize of 3,000 dollars.)

64
00:02:12,050 --> 00:02:14,619
You will divide into 2 groups of 3 runaways and 5 chasers...

65
00:02:14,620 --> 00:02:16,488
to proceed with the race.

66
00:02:16,489 --> 00:02:17,619
There are three runaways?

67
00:02:17,620 --> 00:02:20,788
Right now, Jong Kook has no idea about this mission.

68
00:02:20,789 --> 00:02:23,689
During the opening segment, we plan to inform you that...

69
00:02:23,690 --> 00:02:26,529
only 1st, 2nd, and 3rd places of the fake mission will be able...

70
00:02:26,530 --> 00:02:28,659
to eat at a restaurant, recommended by Jong Kook.

71
00:02:28,660 --> 00:02:29,668
Only three?

72
00:02:29,669 --> 00:02:32,029
However, the meal isn't the goal of those three members.

73
00:02:32,030 --> 00:02:34,499
(1st, 2nd, and 3rd places will be runaways.)

74
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:36,209
You'll be chosen as runaways.

75
00:02:36,210 --> 00:02:37,568
- Runaway? - There are three runaways...

76
00:02:37,569 --> 00:02:40,679
and 5 chasers. And 5 chasers will be in Jong Kook's team.

77
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:43,084
- Chasers? - Chasers are in Jong Kook's team?

78
00:02:43,579 --> 00:02:45,679
Three runaways must run away.

79
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:48,679
Their advantage is that they will split 3,000 dollars among them.

80
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:50,925
So they will be getting a bigger cut of the cash prize.

81
00:02:51,620 --> 00:02:53,358
- 3,000 dollars. - Right.

82
00:02:53,359 --> 00:02:55,159
- We should go for runaways. - Right.

83
00:02:55,160 --> 00:02:57,059
- All right. We'll move then. - Okay.

84
00:02:57,060 --> 00:02:58,758
(Will they be runaways or chasers? That's the question.)

85
00:02:58,759 --> 00:03:00,559
(Haha, who joined late, was also informed of this.)

86
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:02,129
- Hello. - Hello.

87
00:03:02,130 --> 00:03:03,505
Hello.

88
00:03:03,930 --> 00:03:05,629
Today's weather is amazing.

89
00:03:05,630 --> 00:03:07,999
- This is Jong Kook's turf. - Hello.

90
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,038
I didn't know about this place.

91
00:03:09,039 --> 00:03:10,939
Haha's pants are dangling.

92
00:03:10,940 --> 00:03:12,538
Be quiet.

93
00:03:12,539 --> 00:03:14,955
(They start the opening segment by criticizing each other's outfit.)

94
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:17,779
(It's impossible not to criticize his outfit though.)

95
00:03:17,780 --> 00:03:18,809
Be quiet.

96
00:03:18,810 --> 00:03:20,795
Everything including the weather is great today.

97
00:03:20,850 --> 00:03:21,849
My gosh, he's...

98
00:03:21,850 --> 00:03:24,488
- Look at Haha's pants. - What's wrong with him?

99
00:03:24,489 --> 00:03:26,858
You're not supposed to make it so obvious.

100
00:03:26,859 --> 00:03:28,758
I don't get his style.

101
00:03:28,759 --> 00:03:30,689
- But... - By the way, I didn't know...

102
00:03:30,690 --> 00:03:32,358
- Anyang developed this much. - Isn't this a nice place?

103
00:03:32,359 --> 00:03:33,629
- Anyang is such a nice place. - Jong Kook's hometown.

104
00:03:33,630 --> 00:03:36,705
Back then, this used to be the amusement park in Anyang.

105
00:03:36,930 --> 00:03:39,568
We used to play Diving Beetle Game in the front over there.

106
00:03:39,569 --> 00:03:41,038
- To see which one would be faster? - No.

107
00:03:41,039 --> 00:03:42,839
- It would choose a slot. - I know what it is.

108
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:45,839
It would just go into a slot. We played that game a lot here.

109
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:47,309
- So when I heard that... - Back in the day...

110
00:03:47,310 --> 00:03:50,409
we were filming in Anyang, I knew this was for Jong Kook.

111
00:03:50,410 --> 00:03:51,578
- Right. - By the way,

112
00:03:51,579 --> 00:03:53,149
it's so nice to come here after such a long time.

113
00:03:53,150 --> 00:03:54,619
- It's gotten so much nicer. - If it's Anyang, it Jong Kook.

114
00:03:54,620 --> 00:03:55,948
- If it's Jong Kook, it's Anyang. - Anyang.

115
00:03:55,949 --> 00:03:57,048
- Anyang Tiger. - Yes.

116
00:03:57,049 --> 00:03:58,649
- He is. - Hello.

117
00:03:58,650 --> 00:04:00,488
I'm from Jeongseon.

118
00:04:00,489 --> 00:04:03,559
- By the way... Anyang's celebrity? - Some say I'm Anyang's celebrity.

119
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:06,675
(Seok Jin becomes invisible as they pretend not to hear him.)

120
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:09,668
- They're not listening to Seok Jin. - Hold on.

121
00:04:09,669 --> 00:04:11,828
- This won't air anyway. - I mean... He's in the middle.

122
00:04:11,829 --> 00:04:12,939
Even the cameraman didn't get him.

123
00:04:12,940 --> 00:04:14,999
When he said, "Hello, I'm from Jeongseon",

124
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,439
- no one paid attention. - Here's a thing.

125
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:17,469
- Se Chan. - Yes?

126
00:04:17,470 --> 00:04:19,138
- I've been to Jeongseon with him. - Okay.

127
00:04:19,139 --> 00:04:21,038
- And people there don't know him. - Exactly.

128
00:04:21,039 --> 00:04:22,678
(People in Jeongseon don't know him.)

129
00:04:22,679 --> 00:04:24,048
Besides, you didn't live there...

130
00:04:24,049 --> 00:04:25,209
- for a long time. - I'm serious.

131
00:04:25,210 --> 00:04:27,019
- Seriously. They didn't know him. - You didn't live there for long.

132
00:04:27,020 --> 00:04:28,878
- I went there with Seok Jin before. - Fine.

133
00:04:28,879 --> 00:04:30,548
I came to Seoul when I was three.

134
00:04:30,549 --> 00:04:32,959
- People there don't know. - I came to Seoul when I was three.

135
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:34,019
But I was born in Jeongseon.

136
00:04:34,020 --> 00:04:35,889
People like him always go back...

137
00:04:35,890 --> 00:04:37,889
and say they are from there when they are running for office.

138
00:04:37,890 --> 00:04:39,529
I won't run for office.

139
00:04:39,530 --> 00:04:40,959
(He'll win votes as the guy from Jeongseon.)

140
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:42,159
- You'd shake hands at the markets. - I'm serious.

141
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:43,628
- I won't run for office. - You'd go to the markets.

142
00:04:43,629 --> 00:04:44,668
You don't need to worry about him.

143
00:04:44,669 --> 00:04:46,599
I won't be able to pass the hearing.

144
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:48,839
(Suddenly reflecting on himself)

145
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:52,715
(The guy from Jeongseon isn't that upright.)

146
00:04:53,010 --> 00:04:54,238
I can't do it.

147
00:04:54,239 --> 00:04:55,878
- Seok Jin. - I can't.

148
00:04:55,879 --> 00:04:57,748
- Even if you don't pass it... - He's criticizing himself.

149
00:04:57,749 --> 00:04:58,779
(That won't happen in this life.)

150
00:04:58,780 --> 00:05:00,378
- That's funny. - Right.

151
00:05:00,379 --> 00:05:02,649
Are we going to do something with Jong Kook?

152
00:05:02,650 --> 00:05:04,949
Today, we'll be filming the whole episode in Anyang.

153
00:05:04,950 --> 00:05:06,759
We will be going on a tour of popular places,

154
00:05:06,760 --> 00:05:09,159
recommended by Jong Kook, the son of Anyang.

155
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:10,329
(Giving them a fake mission)

156
00:05:10,330 --> 00:05:12,529
(Reacting zealously to the fake mission)

157
00:05:12,530 --> 00:05:14,228
- Nice. Popular places. - The whole episode is in Anyang?

158
00:05:14,229 --> 00:05:16,374
- Popular places? - The whole episode is in Anyang.

159
00:05:16,499 --> 00:05:17,498
- My gosh. - The whole episode in Anyang.

160
00:05:17,499 --> 00:05:19,645
We'll be visiting some back alleys today.

161
00:05:19,700 --> 00:05:21,298
I want to share my memories about the alleys.

162
00:05:21,299 --> 00:05:23,545
- Anyang First Street. - But those stories can't air on TV.

163
00:05:23,640 --> 00:05:25,108
Take us to the places that can air on TV.

164
00:05:25,109 --> 00:05:26,839
Will we go to restaurants that you handled too?

165
00:05:26,840 --> 00:05:29,085
- Be quiet. - "Handled"?

166
00:05:29,239 --> 00:05:31,548
If you're going to talk today, change your pants first.

167
00:05:31,549 --> 00:05:33,525
(He's banned from talking.)

168
00:05:33,619 --> 00:05:35,219
Okay. Put up with this for the opening segment.

169
00:05:35,220 --> 00:05:36,589
(He can't talk in sagging pants.)

170
00:05:36,590 --> 00:05:40,235
Is there a place you'd like to go in Anyang with the members?

171
00:05:40,520 --> 00:05:42,159
I have a few places in mind.

172
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:44,659
When you come to a different area, restaurants are important.

173
00:05:44,660 --> 00:05:45,959
- Right. Food is important. - Right.

174
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:47,259
- So I thought about it. - But...

175
00:05:47,260 --> 00:05:49,358
When I was in school, I didn't...

176
00:05:49,359 --> 00:05:51,228
- have that much money. - Right.

177
00:05:51,229 --> 00:05:53,545
- But I was reminded of this place. - Which one?

178
00:05:53,640 --> 00:05:56,485
Back in the days, Tripe Alley was famous in Anyang.

179
00:05:57,239 --> 00:05:59,509
Back then, for just five dollars,

180
00:05:59,510 --> 00:06:01,938
- the four of us could eat a meal. - Let's eat a lot.

181
00:06:01,939 --> 00:06:03,349
- And we stir-fried rice too. - Five dollars?

182
00:06:03,350 --> 00:06:04,649
- It was that cheap? - Yes.

183
00:06:04,650 --> 00:06:06,579
Wasn't that only for you and your friends?

184
00:06:06,580 --> 00:06:08,595
(Slandering him for the 2nd time)

185
00:06:09,119 --> 00:06:10,118
(That's not it.)

186
00:06:10,119 --> 00:06:12,488
- I don't believe you. - Back then, it was traditional.

187
00:06:12,489 --> 00:06:14,688
But now, it's been modernized.

188
00:06:14,689 --> 00:06:17,228
- It's been around for a long time. - It was like a shantytown.

189
00:06:17,229 --> 00:06:18,628
- There was a second floor. - I bet it was quite scenic.

190
00:06:18,629 --> 00:06:20,628
There was a second floor.

191
00:06:20,629 --> 00:06:22,329
- It sounds like the real deal. - We would go upstairs.

192
00:06:22,330 --> 00:06:25,928
Back in the days, I got into a lot of fights there.

193
00:06:25,929 --> 00:06:28,668
Most of Jong Kook's old memories in Anyang...

194
00:06:28,669 --> 00:06:31,038
end with a fight, at least 50 percent of them.

195
00:06:31,039 --> 00:06:32,839
- Every story ends with a fight. - It's all about fighting.

196
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:34,738
It was bound to happen. Back then, we were...

197
00:06:34,739 --> 00:06:37,009
- full of energy. - That's right.

198
00:06:37,010 --> 00:06:39,279
- It was a city of youth. - Right, right.

199
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:40,378
Places like Anyang First Street.

200
00:06:40,379 --> 00:06:42,048
If you come here at like 5 or 6 a.m.,

201
00:06:42,049 --> 00:06:43,089
the place is still crowded.

202
00:06:43,090 --> 00:06:44,219
- Even now? - Yes.

203
00:06:44,220 --> 00:06:45,589
(It's famous for having a lot of fun places for the youth.)

204
00:06:45,590 --> 00:06:48,165
There's this interesting place right next to here.

205
00:06:48,189 --> 00:06:49,259
- All right. Let's stop. - All of...

206
00:06:49,260 --> 00:06:51,358
(Cutting)

207
00:06:51,359 --> 00:06:53,535
(Why are we stopping all of a sudden?)

208
00:06:53,700 --> 00:06:55,475
- My gosh, nice timing. - Right.

209
00:06:55,499 --> 00:06:56,868
- Nice timing. - The story was getting long.

210
00:06:56,869 --> 00:06:58,475
- It was getting long. - That was perfect.

211
00:06:58,970 --> 00:07:00,668
It's because the neighborhood is...

212
00:07:00,669 --> 00:07:01,868
(Feigned laughter)

213
00:07:01,869 --> 00:07:02,868
- This is fun. - Yes, just laugh.

214
00:07:02,869 --> 00:07:04,469
- Laugh it off. - It was funny.

215
00:07:04,470 --> 00:07:06,538
- It was funny. - Number three.

216
00:07:06,539 --> 00:07:08,378
All right.

217
00:07:08,379 --> 00:07:11,108
While we reserve a restaurant in the alley,

218
00:07:11,109 --> 00:07:14,719
you will carry out a mission that only the top three members...

219
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:16,488
will get to benefit from.

220
00:07:16,489 --> 00:07:17,764
- What is this? - What is it?

221
00:07:18,619 --> 00:07:20,434
(Pretending to be clueless)

222
00:07:20,989 --> 00:07:24,058
(Actually, Jong Kook is the only one who doesn't know about the race.)

223
00:07:24,059 --> 00:07:28,899
(Only the top 3 members will get to have the meal as promised.)

224
00:07:28,900 --> 00:07:32,275
(Actually, those 3 members will be 3 runaways.)

225
00:07:32,669 --> 00:07:37,969
(In other words, this is a mission to choose 3 runaways.)

226
00:07:37,970 --> 00:07:39,139
- Three? - What is it?

227
00:07:39,140 --> 00:07:40,438
(Pretending to hear it for the first time)

228
00:07:40,439 --> 00:07:44,378
Jong Kook, you must also be 1 of the top 3 members to eat as well.

229
00:07:44,379 --> 00:07:45,409
(If he's in the top 3, the member in 4th place will be a runway.)

230
00:07:45,410 --> 00:07:47,225
So only a few of us will get to eat.

231
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:49,554
Only three of you will get to eat.

232
00:07:50,320 --> 00:07:52,319
- Stir-fried sundae is really good. - Tripe?

233
00:07:52,320 --> 00:07:53,389
It's no joke.

234
00:07:53,390 --> 00:07:54,459
- Stir-fried sundae. - That sounds delicious.

235
00:07:54,460 --> 00:07:56,259
- Stir-fried sundae is the best. - That sounds good.

236
00:07:56,260 --> 00:07:58,358
- It's so good. - After you get into team uniforms,

237
00:07:58,359 --> 00:08:01,399
- we'll start the mission. - Alrighty.

238
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:03,029
- "Alrighty"? - Come on, Seok Jin.

239
00:08:03,030 --> 00:08:04,675
- Let's go. - The guy from Jeongseon.

240
00:08:06,700 --> 00:08:10,514
(The fake mission set is prepared in the best way it can be.)

241
00:08:10,910 --> 00:08:13,779
(20 bowling pins...)

242
00:08:13,780 --> 00:08:15,554
(and a huge slingshot)

243
00:08:15,710 --> 00:08:16,849
(What kind of mission will unfold?)

244
00:08:16,850 --> 00:08:18,384
Se Chan!

245
00:08:18,879 --> 00:08:20,494
Se Chan!

246
00:08:21,479 --> 00:08:22,949
Se Chan!

247
00:08:22,950 --> 00:08:23,988
- What's wrong with her? - What's with her?

248
00:08:23,989 --> 00:08:26,165
(Acting cheerful for no reason)

249
00:08:26,489 --> 00:08:28,795
You're going mad because the weather is great.

250
00:08:29,090 --> 00:08:30,735
She's like an elementary school kid.

251
00:08:31,689 --> 00:08:34,159
(Getting excited before the fake mission)

252
00:08:34,160 --> 00:08:35,428
- What's wrong with her? - Are you having fun?

253
00:08:35,429 --> 00:08:37,399
Perhaps, Anyang suits her. She's in a good mood.

254
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:39,868
- I guess so. - Hey, Anyang must suit her well.

255
00:08:39,869 --> 00:08:43,608
Actually, she stepped in poop earlier.

256
00:08:43,609 --> 00:08:45,969
- You did? It means you'll be lucky. - She did.

257
00:08:45,970 --> 00:08:47,608
- It will be your lucky day. - She'll be lucky today.

258
00:08:47,609 --> 00:08:48,709
- I stepped in dog poop. - On human feces?

259
00:08:48,710 --> 00:08:50,349
- You really did? - Gosh, So Min.

260
00:08:50,350 --> 00:08:52,049
Stepping in poop doesn't happen that often nowadays.

261
00:08:52,050 --> 00:08:53,419
- It's not that easy. - Right.

262
00:08:53,420 --> 00:08:55,179
Nowadays, there isn't much poop on the streets.

263
00:08:55,180 --> 00:08:57,118
- It happened when we were kids. - Right.

264
00:08:57,119 --> 00:08:59,758
- I guess I'm that unlucky. - No, it means you're really lucky.

265
00:08:59,759 --> 00:09:02,658
I told you that only the top three members can eat the meal.

266
00:09:02,659 --> 00:09:03,988
- I have to eat. - Let's win this!

267
00:09:03,989 --> 00:09:05,358
- This place serves great food. - I'm hungry.

268
00:09:05,359 --> 00:09:08,329
- Please. - The mission for the meal is...

269
00:09:08,330 --> 00:09:10,628
- Fly, Grocery Basket. - Okay!

270
00:09:10,629 --> 00:09:11,768
Fly what?

271
00:09:11,769 --> 00:09:12,799
Grocery Basket?

272
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:14,069
(What's that? Fly, Grocery Basket?)

273
00:09:14,070 --> 00:09:15,998
With the time limit, 10 minutes, you have to put objects...

274
00:09:15,999 --> 00:09:18,745
- around you in the basket. - Around us?

275
00:09:18,940 --> 00:09:20,339
After 10 minutes, you'll take turns...

276
00:09:20,340 --> 00:09:22,809
to fly your grocery basket with this huge slingshot.

277
00:09:22,810 --> 00:09:25,554
The three members that knock down the most pins will win.

278
00:09:25,649 --> 00:09:27,778
The whole basket? The stuff inside will fly out too.

279
00:09:27,779 --> 00:09:28,949
We shouldn't put in heavy things...

280
00:09:28,950 --> 00:09:30,365
- because they won't fly far. - Right.

281
00:09:30,389 --> 00:09:33,819
- Fill your basket for 10 minutes. - Where?

282
00:09:33,820 --> 00:09:36,365
In this case, wouldn't water bottles or beverage bottles be the best?

283
00:09:37,029 --> 00:09:39,135
This is the best. They are hard.

284
00:09:39,159 --> 00:09:40,434
How heavy should it be?

285
00:09:40,930 --> 00:09:42,059
It's heavy.

286
00:09:42,060 --> 00:09:44,228
(These 3 members go straight to a grocery store nearby.)

287
00:09:44,229 --> 00:09:46,204
- This will be more than enough. - Yes. It will be.

288
00:09:46,540 --> 00:09:47,569
(Silver trays and 5 referee uniforms)

289
00:09:47,570 --> 00:09:48,638
Nice.

290
00:09:48,639 --> 00:09:49,714
Okay.

291
00:09:49,810 --> 00:09:51,008
You filled it up.

292
00:09:51,009 --> 00:09:52,245
(He chose 5 toy hammers which suit him well.)

293
00:09:52,340 --> 00:09:54,584
- They'll scatter and fly. - Right.

294
00:09:54,609 --> 00:09:56,214
This will be more than enough.

295
00:09:56,950 --> 00:09:58,309
- Okay. Great. - Okay!

296
00:09:58,310 --> 00:09:59,625
(Order of Members' Turns)

297
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:01,625
This looks like fun.

298
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:04,425
- Move back. - Is that how you load it?

299
00:10:04,489 --> 00:10:06,148
Whether it goes well or not,

300
00:10:06,149 --> 00:10:07,858
- it depends on your luck. - Right.

301
00:10:07,859 --> 00:10:10,165
- It's all about luck. - You only get one chance.

302
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:12,388
Actually, if the basket lands in the center, it's a strike.

303
00:10:12,389 --> 00:10:14,074
- Of course. - If it falls, it's over.

304
00:10:14,499 --> 00:10:15,658
That looks good.

305
00:10:15,659 --> 00:10:17,169
(Pulling the basket)

306
00:10:17,170 --> 00:10:18,505
- That looks good. - Good.

307
00:10:18,629 --> 00:10:19,728
- My gosh. - Good.

308
00:10:19,729 --> 00:10:20,915
(Aiming for the bowling pins.)

309
00:10:21,769 --> 00:10:23,115
Right. I should move it this way.

310
00:10:24,639 --> 00:10:25,939
Okay.

311
00:10:25,940 --> 00:10:26,978
One.

312
00:10:26,979 --> 00:10:28,579
(Haha's basket is full of ice cream.)

313
00:10:28,580 --> 00:10:29,679
- There you go. - Two.

314
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:31,554
(This will be a strike.)

315
00:10:32,479 --> 00:10:35,795
(How many bowling pins will Haha knock down?)

316
00:10:36,249 --> 00:10:37,319
Darn it!

317
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:38,594
(What was that?)

318
00:10:39,220 --> 00:10:40,789
(With full of energy,)

319
00:10:40,790 --> 00:10:42,765
(he fails the mission.)

320
00:10:43,930 --> 00:10:46,365
(Rolling)

321
00:10:47,060 --> 00:10:49,505
- We have to aim higher. - We have to pull harder.

322
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:52,599
- You need to pull downwards more. - That's why the order matters.

323
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:54,199
- I have to pull harder? - You have to pull harder.

324
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:55,599
I was going to tell you, but I didn't.

325
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:57,285
(Haha gets 0 pins.)

326
00:10:57,509 --> 00:10:58,745
My gosh, this...

327
00:10:58,869 --> 00:11:01,354
Jong Kook's basket looks really light.

328
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:02,809
Jong Kook taped up his basket.

329
00:11:02,810 --> 00:11:04,778
(To make sure it flies as a whole, he wrapped it in tape.)

330
00:11:04,779 --> 00:11:06,478
(Pulling)

331
00:11:06,479 --> 00:11:08,179
Actually, that might be better.

332
00:11:08,180 --> 00:11:09,919
- Will the tape make it better? - I'll go.

333
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:11,064
Okay.

334
00:11:11,389 --> 00:11:14,765
(How many bowling pins will Jong Kook knock down?)

335
00:11:15,220 --> 00:11:18,064
(It accurately flew toward the bowling pins.)

336
00:11:24,070 --> 00:11:26,204
(It landed right in front of the bowling pins.)

337
00:11:26,869 --> 00:11:28,699
(I was so close!)

338
00:11:28,700 --> 00:11:29,939
Had he pulled a bit harder...

339
00:11:29,940 --> 00:11:31,539
- It fell in front of the pins. - Right in front of the pins.

340
00:11:31,540 --> 00:11:34,278
- Had his basket heavier... - That was close.

341
00:11:34,279 --> 00:11:36,079
- I thought it was a strike. - I should pull harder.

342
00:11:36,080 --> 00:11:38,484
- Same here. - I thought it'd fall in the center.

343
00:11:38,509 --> 00:11:40,319
I thought I was pulling it too hard,

344
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:43,324
so I moved a bit forward at the last minute.

345
00:11:44,149 --> 00:11:46,125
- I get it now. - Okay.

346
00:11:46,619 --> 00:11:48,388
(Loading the basket, full of plastic plates)

347
00:11:48,389 --> 00:11:49,518
- Here he goes. - My gosh. If the plates...

348
00:11:49,519 --> 00:11:51,234
- fly all over the place, - If they come at us...

349
00:11:51,290 --> 00:11:53,474
- it would be a mess. - Kwang Soo.

350
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:55,405
I think they might come all the way here.

351
00:11:56,060 --> 00:11:57,944
(Launching a pile of plates)

352
00:11:58,399 --> 00:11:59,745
They all broke.

353
00:12:00,570 --> 00:12:02,515
(Crazy party with plates)

354
00:12:02,769 --> 00:12:04,138
(He still knocks down the pins.)

355
00:12:04,139 --> 00:12:05,844
- He got three pins. - Okay.

356
00:12:06,409 --> 00:12:08,339
(With a large number of plates,)

357
00:12:08,340 --> 00:12:11,079
(he knocks down 3 pins.)

358
00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:13,184
- Okay. I'm in first place for now. - Three?

359
00:12:14,779 --> 00:12:16,278
- What is this? - Hey, clean this up.

360
00:12:16,279 --> 00:12:17,865
- What is all this? - Clean your mess up.

361
00:12:17,989 --> 00:12:19,549
- I'm sorry. - You broke all the plates.

362
00:12:19,550 --> 00:12:21,194
I'm sorry.

363
00:12:21,519 --> 00:12:23,118
But somehow, you knocked down some pins.

364
00:12:23,119 --> 00:12:24,388
I'm so glad.

365
00:12:24,389 --> 00:12:25,758
He got three pins.

366
00:12:25,759 --> 00:12:27,028
(Kwang Soo is in 1st place with 3 pins.)

367
00:12:27,029 --> 00:12:28,505
Three is a pretty good score.

368
00:12:28,830 --> 00:12:30,104
That's not a bad score.

369
00:12:30,300 --> 00:12:31,474
All right, Seok Jin.

370
00:12:31,970 --> 00:12:33,439
- You must give back the ball. - Okay.

371
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:37,368
(Seok Jin filled his basket with snacks and props.)

372
00:12:37,369 --> 00:12:39,069
(I'll knock them all down with this.)

373
00:12:39,070 --> 00:12:41,439
He's aiming it higher, so the objects will fall from above.

374
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:42,939
- Right. - Pull it more.

375
00:12:42,940 --> 00:12:45,155
- Pull it more. There you go. - Great, great.

376
00:12:45,550 --> 00:12:46,954
(Launching)

377
00:12:47,619 --> 00:12:50,665
(The snacks are charging at the pins just like the plates.)

378
00:12:51,050 --> 00:12:52,224
Seok Jin.

379
00:12:54,119 --> 00:12:56,535
(Rolling)

380
00:12:56,619 --> 00:12:58,635
- It's food! - Yes!

381
00:12:59,759 --> 00:13:02,474
(This time, it's a crazy snack party.)

382
00:13:03,229 --> 00:13:04,675
This is dalgona.

383
00:13:04,700 --> 00:13:05,829
- This is red bean jelly. - Yes!

384
00:13:05,830 --> 00:13:07,145
(What a generous game.)

385
00:13:07,570 --> 00:13:08,915
(Picking up)

386
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:10,339
Hey, although...

387
00:13:10,340 --> 00:13:12,508
Seok Jin failed, it was entertaining.

388
00:13:12,509 --> 00:13:13,655
- Darn it. - You know?

389
00:13:14,040 --> 00:13:15,709
- Gosh, Seok Jin. - Darn it.

390
00:13:15,710 --> 00:13:17,679
- I want the chocolate biscuits. - You can have it.

391
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:18,954
Yes, chocolate biscuits.

392
00:13:19,350 --> 00:13:21,618
- Snacks fell from the sky. - My grandpa liked this.

393
00:13:21,619 --> 00:13:23,495
By the way, this is a festival today.

394
00:13:23,950 --> 00:13:26,464
- Hey, it's Seok Jin's gift for us. - The ultimate gift set.

395
00:13:26,649 --> 00:13:28,995
I should have taped it together.

396
00:13:29,019 --> 00:13:30,304
I'll show you.

397
00:13:30,960 --> 00:13:32,758
By the way, today's game is nice.

398
00:13:32,759 --> 00:13:34,234
- We can have snacks in between. - Right.

399
00:13:34,960 --> 00:13:36,675
- He threw us snacks. - Everyone.

400
00:13:37,129 --> 00:13:39,344
I won't be petty. I'll do it in one go.

401
00:13:39,930 --> 00:13:42,069
You've been living a petty life up to now.

402
00:13:42,070 --> 00:13:44,814
(You've been living a petty life up to now.)

403
00:13:45,540 --> 00:13:46,745
- I'll show you. - What do you mean?

404
00:13:46,840 --> 00:13:48,278
- I'll show you, Jong Kook. - Okay.

405
00:13:48,279 --> 00:13:50,449
- You should aim it higher. - Okay.

406
00:13:50,450 --> 00:13:52,579
(He filled up the basket with noise-making junk.)

407
00:13:52,580 --> 00:13:53,679
Okay.

408
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:54,748
(Pulling)

409
00:13:54,749 --> 00:13:56,018
- Nice. - I think I can do better now.

410
00:13:56,019 --> 00:13:57,165
Be careful.

411
00:13:57,389 --> 00:13:58,689
He looks really determined.

412
00:13:58,690 --> 00:14:00,658
- Here I go. - He's determined to win.

413
00:14:00,659 --> 00:14:02,265
All right. Here I go. I'll let go now.

414
00:14:02,989 --> 00:14:04,988
(You want to be a runaway, too?)

415
00:14:04,989 --> 00:14:06,365
(Surprised)

416
00:14:07,029 --> 00:14:10,035
(How many bowling pins did Jae Seok knock down?)

417
00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:12,974
- 3. - 3.

418
00:14:14,040 --> 00:14:16,645
(He got 3 pins with maraca's handle.)

419
00:14:17,210 --> 00:14:18,738
(I could've gotten more. I only got 3?)

420
00:14:18,739 --> 00:14:19,915
- Jae Seok. - Goodness.

421
00:14:20,609 --> 00:14:21,684
Jae Seok!

422
00:14:22,409 --> 00:14:23,908
This saved you.

423
00:14:23,909 --> 00:14:24,984
Is that so?

424
00:14:25,279 --> 00:14:27,219
(This small maraca saved him.)

425
00:14:27,220 --> 00:14:28,425
This got you all three pins.

426
00:14:29,879 --> 00:14:32,064
(This clip shows that one maraca got all the pins.)

427
00:14:32,790 --> 00:14:33,934
(Hitting)

428
00:14:33,960 --> 00:14:35,919
(The lucky attack from the handle)

429
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:38,128
- This saved you. - Is that so?

430
00:14:38,129 --> 00:14:40,199
This got you all three pins. You didn't need anything else.

431
00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:43,204
- I should have opened the basket. - You should have kept it open.

432
00:14:43,999 --> 00:14:45,699
It's Se Chan's turn? I don't think it will work.

433
00:14:45,700 --> 00:14:47,015
That looks promising.

434
00:14:47,470 --> 00:14:48,638
(A bomb with a tray)

435
00:14:48,639 --> 00:14:49,844
This is heavy.

436
00:14:49,970 --> 00:14:51,539
Look at his basket. Do you think that will fly?

437
00:14:51,540 --> 00:14:53,108
Don't forget about the wind resistance.

438
00:14:53,109 --> 00:14:55,184
Because of the wind, it will fall right here. Just watch.

439
00:14:55,840 --> 00:14:57,755
Or it will get stuck and fall right there instead.

440
00:14:58,409 --> 00:15:00,054
Or it will go back and hit you.

441
00:15:00,220 --> 00:15:02,554
I think we're the best at criticizing each other.

442
00:15:02,749 --> 00:15:04,648
How did you guys pull this back?

443
00:15:04,649 --> 00:15:06,349
(This is harder than it looks.)

444
00:15:06,350 --> 00:15:07,765
Figure it out yourself, punk.

445
00:15:09,359 --> 00:15:10,728
(He sounds cold.)

446
00:15:10,729 --> 00:15:11,728
(Hold on.)

447
00:15:11,729 --> 00:15:12,905
Why are you asking us?

448
00:15:13,060 --> 00:15:15,175
Really? You're disappointing me.

449
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:16,699
- This is a competition. - The thing is...

450
00:15:16,700 --> 00:15:19,074
now that they are in Anyang, they're feeling the vibe here.

451
00:15:19,399 --> 00:15:20,699
I guess everyone is feeling it.

452
00:15:20,700 --> 00:15:22,138
- Just like Anyang Hothead. - Right.

453
00:15:22,139 --> 00:15:23,714
I hope the band snaps and hits your face.

454
00:15:24,409 --> 00:15:25,508
- There you go. - Move.

455
00:15:25,509 --> 00:15:27,015
Hey, why are you helping him?

456
00:15:28,580 --> 00:15:29,679
(Surprised)

457
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:31,408
- Move. - Hey, why are you helping him?

458
00:15:31,409 --> 00:15:32,908
(How many bowling pins did Se Chan knock down?)

459
00:15:32,909 --> 00:15:34,094
(Hitting)

460
00:15:36,519 --> 00:15:37,849
(4 pins are knocked down.)

461
00:15:37,850 --> 00:15:39,295
- 4. - 4.

462
00:15:40,290 --> 00:15:41,988
(He gets in 1st place with Jae Seok's help.)

463
00:15:41,989 --> 00:15:42,988
I got four pins!

464
00:15:42,989 --> 00:15:44,429
(I'm in 1st place!)

465
00:15:44,430 --> 00:15:45,934
- 4 pins. - So he's in 1st place.

466
00:15:46,729 --> 00:15:48,074
- What? - Hey.

467
00:15:48,729 --> 00:15:50,398
- You know I helped you, right? - I'll remember that.

468
00:15:50,399 --> 00:15:51,768
- That's cheating. - You know that, right?

469
00:15:51,769 --> 00:15:53,128
- No, this is okay. - It's not cheating.

470
00:15:53,129 --> 00:15:54,375
(Why did he help? To get food from him?)

471
00:15:54,840 --> 00:15:56,238
(The remaining runaways will be decided after the last 2 members.)

472
00:15:56,239 --> 00:15:57,309
Gosh, So Min.

473
00:15:57,310 --> 00:15:58,569
(The remaining runaways will be decided after the last 2 members.)

474
00:15:58,570 --> 00:16:01,054
She probably can't even pull it. Just leave her alone. Don't help.

475
00:16:01,180 --> 00:16:02,954
- Come on, Seok Jin. - I'll help you.

476
00:16:03,080 --> 00:16:04,648
(I'll be a runaway too.)

477
00:16:04,649 --> 00:16:06,525
(Looking somewhat determined)

478
00:16:07,379 --> 00:16:09,454
- You might fly with the basket. - Ground your feet.

479
00:16:09,580 --> 00:16:11,025
- You have a good angle. - There you go.

480
00:16:11,950 --> 00:16:13,789
(She sits down to aim unlike the other members.)

481
00:16:13,790 --> 00:16:15,395
- That's good. - 1, 2, 3.

482
00:16:18,060 --> 00:16:20,734
(Falling)

483
00:16:21,460 --> 00:16:22,599
2, 3.

484
00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:24,704
(The objects hit the slingshot and fall in front of her.)

485
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:25,944
2, 3.

486
00:16:25,999 --> 00:16:28,214
(Look at that.)

487
00:16:28,239 --> 00:16:30,169
- Good job. - What were you doing?

488
00:16:30,170 --> 00:16:31,539
- You're the best. - What?

489
00:16:31,540 --> 00:16:32,868
- Wasn't that pretty good? - You're the best.

490
00:16:32,869 --> 00:16:35,454
- What was that? - This flew the farthest.

491
00:16:35,879 --> 00:16:38,184
- Right here. - The gum flew the farthest.

492
00:16:38,379 --> 00:16:40,518
Wasn't I good? Why didn't it fly?

493
00:16:40,519 --> 00:16:41,925
She's the last one.

494
00:16:42,580 --> 00:16:45,724
If she can't hit 3 or more, it's us 3 who win.

495
00:16:45,749 --> 00:16:47,064
- Okay. - You're right.

496
00:16:47,359 --> 00:16:48,995
She just needs to hit less than three.

497
00:16:50,019 --> 00:16:51,089
(I will get 3.)

498
00:16:51,090 --> 00:16:52,358
I think it'll be difficult.

499
00:16:52,359 --> 00:16:53,934
Are you working at a laundromat or something?

500
00:16:54,159 --> 00:16:55,635
She'll either fail horribly or win with flying colors.

501
00:16:55,759 --> 00:16:57,505
She's strong.

502
00:16:57,970 --> 00:16:59,429
(Struggling)

503
00:16:59,430 --> 00:17:02,214
She's acting weak. Don't pretend.

504
00:17:02,300 --> 00:17:04,969
- Sit down. - That's good.

505
00:17:04,970 --> 00:17:07,554
- Am I good? - That's a good angle.

506
00:17:07,739 --> 00:17:09,238
Count to three.

507
00:17:09,239 --> 00:17:10,349
One...

508
00:17:10,350 --> 00:17:11,509
(The runaways' fate could change.)

509
00:17:11,510 --> 00:17:12,579
Two...

510
00:17:12,580 --> 00:17:17,948
(If she can't get 3, the runaways will be decided.)

511
00:17:17,949 --> 00:17:19,418
1, 2, 3.

512
00:17:19,419 --> 00:17:20,994
(What will be the result?)

513
00:17:24,290 --> 00:17:26,405
(Is it a strike?)

514
00:17:27,230 --> 00:17:29,835
(The package flies towards the bowling pins.)

515
00:17:30,629 --> 00:17:31,744
(She misses.)

516
00:17:32,969 --> 00:17:35,339
(She misses by an inch.)

517
00:17:35,340 --> 00:17:37,638
- Your direction was a bit off. - You were slightly off.

518
00:17:37,639 --> 00:17:39,069
It could've been a strike.

519
00:17:39,070 --> 00:17:40,539
- You could've gotten a strike. - It could've been a strike.

520
00:17:40,540 --> 00:17:42,684
Since it's lighter, it flies farther away.

521
00:17:42,980 --> 00:17:46,279
- You're right. - We got the top three.

522
00:17:46,280 --> 00:17:47,678
That's amazing.

523
00:17:47,679 --> 00:17:50,519
They're Jae Seok, Se Chan, and Kwang Soo.

524
00:17:50,520 --> 00:17:51,794
- Okay! - Okay.

525
00:17:52,020 --> 00:17:54,234
(We're the runaways!)

526
00:17:54,490 --> 00:17:58,605
Now, you three will be runaways.

527
00:17:59,030 --> 00:18:01,204
You will begin running.

528
00:18:01,800 --> 00:18:03,135
What?

529
00:18:03,359 --> 00:18:05,099
You will begin running.

530
00:18:05,100 --> 00:18:06,474
(They will run?)

531
00:18:07,139 --> 00:18:08,138
(Hold on.)

532
00:18:08,139 --> 00:18:09,539
- What did you say? - What's going on?

533
00:18:09,540 --> 00:18:11,309
Please start.

534
00:18:11,310 --> 00:18:12,368
You're so blatant.

535
00:18:12,369 --> 00:18:13,438
Wait.

536
00:18:13,439 --> 00:18:15,708
- It was a secret. - What is this?

537
00:18:15,709 --> 00:18:17,408
- Go on. - Come on.

538
00:18:17,409 --> 00:18:18,708
- This isn't right. - We'll catch you soon.

539
00:18:18,709 --> 00:18:20,395
All right, please begin.

540
00:18:20,550 --> 00:18:21,754
Are they running?

541
00:18:22,020 --> 00:18:23,849
They're running because they won?

542
00:18:23,850 --> 00:18:25,549
Why are we running?

543
00:18:25,550 --> 00:18:26,549
I'm irritated.

544
00:18:26,550 --> 00:18:28,218
They look like runaways.

545
00:18:28,219 --> 00:18:29,658
You're right.

546
00:18:29,659 --> 00:18:31,059
I can't believe this.

547
00:18:31,060 --> 00:18:33,559
I'm good at catching people, but I do it better in Anyang.

548
00:18:33,560 --> 00:18:34,805
Are we running out in the open?

549
00:18:35,330 --> 00:18:36,805
- I thought we're having tripe? - What's going on?

550
00:18:36,859 --> 00:18:38,044
Are we eating it?

551
00:18:38,800 --> 00:18:39,944
I have no idea.

552
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:43,115
I'll tell you about the real race.

553
00:18:43,139 --> 00:18:44,769
It's about the son of Anyang...

554
00:18:44,770 --> 00:18:46,684
who knows Anyang like the back of his hand.

555
00:18:46,909 --> 00:18:49,055
It's a pursuit done by Jong Kook.

556
00:18:49,080 --> 00:18:50,779
It's called Find Kim Jong Kook Race.

557
00:18:50,780 --> 00:18:52,079
- Find Kim Jong Kook Race? - Find Kim Jong Kook Race?

558
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:54,519
Jong Kook and the rest of you are chasers.

559
00:18:54,520 --> 00:18:55,549
Okay.

560
00:18:55,550 --> 00:18:56,625
(The 5 of them are the chasers.)

561
00:18:56,679 --> 00:18:58,749
You are the runaways.

562
00:18:58,750 --> 00:18:59,948
Come on.

563
00:18:59,949 --> 00:19:02,618
Before the chasers catch you,

564
00:19:02,619 --> 00:19:05,489
you must find three places that are sentimental to Jong Kook...

565
00:19:05,490 --> 00:19:07,128
- and have them verified to succeed. - What?

566
00:19:07,129 --> 00:19:09,099
You can search online,

567
00:19:09,100 --> 00:19:11,229
ask his acquaintances, family, and shop owners.

568
00:19:11,230 --> 00:19:12,398
They must be based on their testimonies.

569
00:19:12,399 --> 00:19:14,999
The method of verification will be explained once you get there.

570
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:16,039
(The method will be revealed once they arrive there.)

571
00:19:16,040 --> 00:19:17,845
You're eliminated if they rip off your name tags.

572
00:19:18,040 --> 00:19:20,638
If even one of you survives and gets all three places verified,

573
00:19:20,639 --> 00:19:22,115
you win.

574
00:19:22,310 --> 00:19:25,908
However, you must move around together.

575
00:19:25,909 --> 00:19:27,724
We need to be together.

576
00:19:27,879 --> 00:19:31,618
If you rip off all of their name tags,

577
00:19:31,619 --> 00:19:33,688
you will acquire 3,000 dollars.

578
00:19:33,689 --> 00:19:36,658
(They will be given the reward immediately.)

579
00:19:36,659 --> 00:19:39,789
And it will be allocated by Jong Kook himself.

580
00:19:39,790 --> 00:19:40,858
- Really? - Yes.

581
00:19:40,859 --> 00:19:42,128
He can choose how much he'll give.

582
00:19:42,129 --> 00:19:44,774
Please change into uniforms for the race.

583
00:19:45,030 --> 00:19:46,504
- Are we changing again? - We're changing?

584
00:19:46,629 --> 00:19:48,069
Tell them to change.

585
00:19:48,070 --> 00:19:49,269
(He's lazy.)

586
00:19:49,270 --> 00:19:50,539
- They already ran away. - Really?

587
00:19:50,540 --> 00:19:51,908
- Got it. - Okay.

588
00:19:51,909 --> 00:19:53,044
Okay.

589
00:19:53,780 --> 00:19:55,208
The surviving runaway...

590
00:19:55,209 --> 00:19:57,655
can allocate the reward as he wishes.

591
00:19:58,179 --> 00:19:59,878
- Are we not allowed to split up? - Wait.

592
00:19:59,879 --> 00:20:00,918
If one of us gets caught, it'll be the end of us.

593
00:20:00,919 --> 00:20:03,125
- Let's do this. - What?

594
00:20:03,719 --> 00:20:05,188
At least one of us should survive...

595
00:20:05,189 --> 00:20:06,648
- and protect the money. - Right.

596
00:20:06,649 --> 00:20:08,294
- And we'll split it equally. - Okay.

597
00:20:08,520 --> 00:20:10,464
(Laughing)

598
00:20:10,990 --> 00:20:12,329
I can see that you're lying.

599
00:20:12,330 --> 00:20:14,305
- I'm serious. - I can see through you.

600
00:20:14,330 --> 00:20:16,198
- Hey. - You're smiling.

601
00:20:16,199 --> 00:20:18,468
Seriously? You guys are frightening.

602
00:20:18,469 --> 00:20:20,915
We're a bunch of petty criminals.

603
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:24,085
Okay? One of us needs to survive.

604
00:20:24,209 --> 00:20:26,208
Whether it be me, Kwang Soo, or Se Chan.

605
00:20:26,209 --> 00:20:27,938
Let's look it up online.

606
00:20:27,939 --> 00:20:29,839
- Search up "Jong Kook, Anyang". - We could visit his school.

607
00:20:29,840 --> 00:20:31,585
How about Sinsung High School?

608
00:20:32,149 --> 00:20:34,294
No, they'll find us.

609
00:20:34,619 --> 00:20:36,049
I looked it up,

610
00:20:36,050 --> 00:20:38,065
and "Jong Kook fighting" is a related keyword.

611
00:20:38,590 --> 00:20:41,434
I've heard many rumors about him when I was young.

612
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:42,958
Where did you hear them?

613
00:20:42,959 --> 00:20:44,089
On First Street?

614
00:20:44,090 --> 00:20:45,805
He did go to Anyang First Street often.

615
00:20:47,359 --> 00:20:49,974
Look here. He had a signing event in Anyang before.

616
00:20:50,060 --> 00:20:51,875
- Where? - Jong Kook's signing event.

617
00:20:51,969 --> 00:20:53,698
- Was it recent? - Is this possible?

618
00:20:53,699 --> 00:20:54,938
- Yes. - Really?

619
00:20:54,939 --> 00:20:55,999
- Should we go there? - Let's go there.

620
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:57,239
I doubt they'll think of this place.

621
00:20:57,240 --> 00:20:58,645
Of course not.

622
00:20:58,840 --> 00:21:01,279
- They'd think of schools. - Right.

623
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:02,539
Right? Let's go here.

624
00:21:02,540 --> 00:21:04,454
Then we'll go there.

625
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:06,408
They wouldn't remember the signing event.

626
00:21:06,409 --> 00:21:07,718
- Of course not. - Right.

627
00:21:07,719 --> 00:21:08,718
I doubt they will.

628
00:21:08,719 --> 00:21:11,989
I can't believe I'm always with them...

629
00:21:11,990 --> 00:21:13,718
when I'm running away.

630
00:21:13,719 --> 00:21:15,918
But it suits us.

631
00:21:15,919 --> 00:21:18,065
- We're petty criminals. - You're right.

632
00:21:19,060 --> 00:21:22,099
I'm not the type to run away.

633
00:21:22,100 --> 00:21:24,299
I'm not the type to make such bold actions.

634
00:21:24,300 --> 00:21:25,375
I'm sure you all know that.

635
00:21:25,969 --> 00:21:27,105
I'm...

636
00:21:27,270 --> 00:21:29,668
In a few hours, he'll be hiding behind a minivan.

637
00:21:29,669 --> 00:21:30,708
(He'll be peeking out.)

638
00:21:30,709 --> 00:21:31,845
He'll be afraid.

639
00:21:32,369 --> 00:21:34,039
- Kwang Soo. - "I'm here."

640
00:21:34,040 --> 00:21:35,714
I'm not like that.

641
00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:39,355
(But it actually happened.)

642
00:21:40,109 --> 00:21:43,494
If I was one of the chasers, you guys would be terrified.

643
00:21:44,550 --> 00:21:46,448
- Why do you think that? - If you were a chaser,

644
00:21:46,449 --> 00:21:48,789
you'd team up with Seok Jin and So Min.

645
00:21:48,790 --> 00:21:50,489
Right. He's disposable.

646
00:21:50,490 --> 00:21:51,529
(It's obvious.)

647
00:21:51,530 --> 00:21:53,388
(While the runaways are headed towards Anyang Station...)

648
00:21:53,389 --> 00:21:55,704
All right, then.

649
00:21:55,830 --> 00:21:58,128
There are a few places I can think of off the top of my head.

650
00:21:58,129 --> 00:21:59,244
I have memories...

651
00:21:59,570 --> 00:22:01,039
- of the underground shopping area. - Right.

652
00:22:01,040 --> 00:22:02,239
The underground shopping area.

653
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:04,608
That's because...

654
00:22:04,609 --> 00:22:05,769
(This shopping area was where many residents used to work.)

655
00:22:05,770 --> 00:22:07,579
(What is his memory of this place?)

656
00:22:07,580 --> 00:22:08,809
- Well... - Did you have a date there?

657
00:22:08,810 --> 00:22:10,438
The mother of my girlfriend in high school...

658
00:22:10,439 --> 00:22:11,608
had a restaurant there.

659
00:22:11,609 --> 00:22:14,279
- Did you eat there? - Whenever we went downtown,

660
00:22:14,280 --> 00:22:16,378
- we'd eat there. - Did you have gimbap?

661
00:22:16,379 --> 00:22:18,789
- We had kimchi fried rice. - That's the place.

662
00:22:18,790 --> 00:22:21,218
- We should go downtown. - Yes, we should.

663
00:22:21,219 --> 00:22:22,395
What about the hair salon?

664
00:22:22,990 --> 00:22:24,089
- What? - The bus station.

665
00:22:24,090 --> 00:22:26,128
That lady who worked there had a crush on you.

666
00:22:26,129 --> 00:22:27,958
(Haha mentions the past.)

667
00:22:27,959 --> 00:22:29,398
- That's it. - He was your first lover.

668
00:22:29,399 --> 00:22:31,805
That was across my school, not downtown.

669
00:22:31,869 --> 00:22:33,829
Is the underground shopping area a sure thing?

670
00:22:33,830 --> 00:22:35,599
I'm pretty sure it's one of them.

671
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:39,615
So it's the shopping area and the police station.

672
00:22:39,740 --> 00:22:40,938
(I don't have memories there.)

673
00:22:40,939 --> 00:22:42,138
School.

674
00:22:42,139 --> 00:22:44,079
- Your school. - Your school.

675
00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:46,155
- I bet they'll be there. - Do you think they'll go that far?

676
00:22:46,209 --> 00:22:47,754
Isn't your school in Anyang?

677
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:49,579
- Of course. - Then they'll be there.

678
00:22:49,580 --> 00:22:50,648
They will be there.

679
00:22:50,649 --> 00:22:53,648
Search up news articles online.

680
00:22:53,649 --> 00:22:55,658
- Se Chan may know many places. - I'm sure Kwang Soo is...

681
00:22:55,659 --> 00:22:56,718
up to something.

682
00:22:56,719 --> 00:22:58,089
I think Se Chan will know some places.

683
00:22:58,090 --> 00:23:00,605
- You must be lost. - Yes.

684
00:23:01,100 --> 00:23:03,529
You have chance cards to find out their whereabouts.

685
00:23:03,530 --> 00:23:04,605
- How? - How?

686
00:23:04,770 --> 00:23:07,128
There's the 30-second Listen-in Card.

687
00:23:07,129 --> 00:23:08,339
(30-second Listen-in Card)

688
00:23:08,340 --> 00:23:10,099
Photo of Their Current Whereabouts.

689
00:23:10,100 --> 00:23:12,608
Then there's Runaways Freeze for 20 Seconds.

690
00:23:12,609 --> 00:23:14,239
Every time you succeed in a mission,

691
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:15,438
you can randomly pick one.

692
00:23:15,439 --> 00:23:17,239
- Okay. That's good. - That's good.

693
00:23:17,240 --> 00:23:18,749
That's good. That works.

694
00:23:18,750 --> 00:23:20,878
- We should do the missions. - Yes.

695
00:23:20,879 --> 00:23:22,754
Your first mission is...

696
00:23:22,949 --> 00:23:24,665
Add or Minus Rock-Paper-Scissors.

697
00:23:24,889 --> 00:23:27,218
You will play rock-paper-scissors with the staff.

698
00:23:27,219 --> 00:23:31,188
All five of you must win or make a draw.

699
00:23:31,189 --> 00:23:32,559
That sounds easy.

700
00:23:32,560 --> 00:23:34,734
If one of you fails, you all fail.

701
00:23:34,800 --> 00:23:36,175
- Really? - You can attempt...

702
00:23:36,199 --> 00:23:37,999
the challenge as many times as you want.

703
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:39,375
- As many times? - As many times?

704
00:23:39,899 --> 00:23:42,368
However, it's not your average game.

705
00:23:42,369 --> 00:23:46,269
For example, if the staff says "without rock, rock-paper-scissors",

706
00:23:46,270 --> 00:23:49,315
you must omit rock and play either scissors or paper.

707
00:23:49,409 --> 00:23:51,448
And you must win or make a draw.

708
00:23:51,449 --> 00:23:53,148
If the staff says, with scissors, rock-paper-scissors,

709
00:23:53,149 --> 00:23:54,694
you must only play scissors.

710
00:23:55,379 --> 00:23:56,878
Then you'll win.

711
00:23:56,879 --> 00:23:58,188
- How could you lose? - Right, how?

712
00:23:58,189 --> 00:24:00,759
It's impossible to lose. We'll win no matter what.

713
00:24:00,760 --> 00:24:02,158
They must think we're fools.

714
00:24:02,159 --> 00:24:03,958
- You're right. - That's what they think.

715
00:24:03,959 --> 00:24:05,759
If rock is omitted, we need to play scissors.

716
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:06,829
- It's easy. - Wait.

717
00:24:06,830 --> 00:24:08,099
- Let's say it's without scissors. - Without scissors.

718
00:24:08,100 --> 00:24:09,635
Rock-paper-scissors

719
00:24:10,230 --> 00:24:12,029
(They need to play paper.)

720
00:24:12,030 --> 00:24:14,415
(She can't play scissors.)

721
00:24:15,500 --> 00:24:16,999
- We need to play this. - Paper.

722
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:18,208
- Exactly. It's tricky. - It is.

723
00:24:18,209 --> 00:24:20,039
- It's tricky. - Hey.

724
00:24:20,040 --> 00:24:22,615
- Then... - Without rock, rock-paper-scissors

725
00:24:23,179 --> 00:24:26,049
(They both need to play scissors.)

726
00:24:26,050 --> 00:24:27,519
(Silence sweeps across the area.)

727
00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:28,994
- We needed to play this. - Scissors.

728
00:24:29,020 --> 00:24:31,418
- This is hard. - It's confusing.

729
00:24:31,419 --> 00:24:33,349
- Hold on. Seok Jin. - When I hear without rock,

730
00:24:33,350 --> 00:24:35,759
- I try to beat rock. - With scissors,

731
00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:36,819
- rock-paper-scissors. - Rock-paper-scissors.

732
00:24:36,820 --> 00:24:38,829
(They can only play scissors.)

733
00:24:38,830 --> 00:24:40,635
- See? You're a fool. - Oh, right.

734
00:24:40,760 --> 00:24:42,305
- It's not easy. - It's confusing.

735
00:24:42,359 --> 00:24:43,474
Haha goes first.

736
00:24:44,199 --> 00:24:45,599
Let's start.

737
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:47,799
With paper, rock-paper-scissors

738
00:24:47,800 --> 00:24:49,875
(Play paper.)

739
00:24:50,070 --> 00:24:51,938
Gosh. Here it is!

740
00:24:51,939 --> 00:24:53,368
(He just needs to play paper.)

741
00:24:53,369 --> 00:24:55,239
(But he plays scissors.)

742
00:24:55,240 --> 00:24:56,539
(He quickly changes to paper.)

743
00:24:56,540 --> 00:24:58,349
Gosh. Here it is!

744
00:24:58,350 --> 00:24:59,749
(He's brazen.)

745
00:24:59,750 --> 00:25:01,454
- I did it. - Again.

746
00:25:02,179 --> 00:25:03,425
This is bad.

747
00:25:03,619 --> 00:25:05,118
With rock, rock-paper-scissors

748
00:25:05,119 --> 00:25:07,595
(With rock, rock-paper-scissors.)

749
00:25:08,020 --> 00:25:10,565
(He needs to play rock, but he fails.)

750
00:25:11,659 --> 00:25:12,989
It was "with", so I'm right.

751
00:25:12,990 --> 00:25:14,358
- You should've played rock. - You lost.

752
00:25:14,359 --> 00:25:15,928
- It was "with scissors". - You did it.

753
00:25:15,929 --> 00:25:16,999
- With scissors. - With rock.

754
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:18,128
Didn't you hear "with scissors"?

755
00:25:18,129 --> 00:25:19,128
(What?)

756
00:25:19,129 --> 00:25:20,599
(It was "with rock"?)

757
00:25:20,600 --> 00:25:22,539
- You said, "scissors". - You said, "scissors".

758
00:25:22,540 --> 00:25:24,044
- It was scissors. - I swear.

759
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:27,115
(They protest.)

760
00:25:27,780 --> 00:25:29,339
- I heard scissors as well. - I swear.

761
00:25:29,340 --> 00:25:31,108
- I swear. - Me too.

762
00:25:31,109 --> 00:25:32,349
- I'll do it again. - I swear.

763
00:25:32,350 --> 00:25:33,448
Yes, me too.

764
00:25:33,449 --> 00:25:35,549
- I heard scissors too. - Me too.

765
00:25:35,550 --> 00:25:37,849
Then let's say paper instead of rock.

766
00:25:37,850 --> 00:25:39,925
(Then let's say paper instead of rock.)

767
00:25:40,090 --> 00:25:41,858
(What?)

768
00:25:41,859 --> 00:25:43,918
- Let's say paper. - Hey, wait.

769
00:25:43,919 --> 00:25:45,405
- This is rock. - This is paper.

770
00:25:45,429 --> 00:25:47,029
She's stupid.

771
00:25:47,030 --> 00:25:48,299
Why is it so confusing?

772
00:25:48,300 --> 00:25:50,575
- Wait. Rock-paper-scissors. - This is paper.

773
00:25:51,899 --> 00:25:53,405
What's wrong with you?

774
00:25:53,770 --> 00:25:54,839
- I just... - What's wrong with her?

775
00:25:54,840 --> 00:25:56,698
- Just pronounce it clearly. - Rock.

776
00:25:56,699 --> 00:25:58,908
- Rock. - That's good.

777
00:25:58,909 --> 00:26:00,878
- We're good at this. - Rock.

778
00:26:00,879 --> 00:26:02,079
- Okay. - We have great teamwork.

779
00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:03,309
(They start again.)

780
00:26:03,310 --> 00:26:05,055
Start. Without paper, rock-paper-scissors

781
00:26:06,010 --> 00:26:07,625
(He needs to play rock, but he fails.)

782
00:26:08,350 --> 00:26:09,655
You lose.

783
00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:11,489
(What should I say this time?)

784
00:26:11,490 --> 00:26:13,249
- This is so tricky. - Let's start with So Min.

785
00:26:13,250 --> 00:26:14,358
Haha can't do it.

786
00:26:14,359 --> 00:26:16,559
- Do you think she's any better? - Who knows.

787
00:26:16,560 --> 00:26:18,034
I don't even know rock-paper-scissors.

788
00:26:18,429 --> 00:26:19,989
Start.

789
00:26:19,990 --> 00:26:21,358
Without paper, rock-paper-scissors

790
00:26:21,359 --> 00:26:23,905
(She plays scissors like Haha and fails.)

791
00:26:24,129 --> 00:26:26,868
(She was concentrating, but she fails once again.)

792
00:26:26,869 --> 00:26:28,815
(He's not smiling.)

793
00:26:29,469 --> 00:26:31,069
- Will you please get it right? - Get it right.

794
00:26:31,070 --> 00:26:32,069
(She feels wronged.)

795
00:26:32,070 --> 00:26:34,438
- I just did it once. - Do better.

796
00:26:34,439 --> 00:26:36,585
- Exactly. What are you doing? - Let's go again.

797
00:26:37,040 --> 00:26:38,224
I'm getting stressed.

798
00:26:38,409 --> 00:26:40,579
- Get a grip on yourself. - Stay frosty.

799
00:26:40,580 --> 00:26:41,579
Start.

800
00:26:41,580 --> 00:26:43,079
Without paper, rock-paper-scissors

801
00:26:43,080 --> 00:26:45,148
(Scissors again?)

802
00:26:45,149 --> 00:26:47,294
(Just so you know, this isn't a replay.)

803
00:26:48,020 --> 00:26:49,519
Gosh, it's all right.

804
00:26:49,520 --> 00:26:50,789
- Without paper... - It's without paper.

805
00:26:50,790 --> 00:26:52,428
So Min, seriously?

806
00:26:52,429 --> 00:26:54,089
- What's wrong with us? - So Min!

807
00:26:54,090 --> 00:26:56,059
- This is frustrating. - Seriously?

808
00:26:56,060 --> 00:26:57,428
What on earth are you doing?

809
00:26:57,429 --> 00:26:58,698
Rock loses to scissors.

810
00:26:58,699 --> 00:27:00,198
This is so frustrating!

811
00:27:00,199 --> 00:27:02,115
I'm sorry too, you know.

812
00:27:02,399 --> 00:27:03,868
- We're... - Again.

813
00:27:03,869 --> 00:27:05,668
Let's practice first. And go.

814
00:27:05,669 --> 00:27:07,415
Without paper, rock-paper-scissors

815
00:27:07,709 --> 00:27:10,284
(A shy pair of scissors)

816
00:27:10,609 --> 00:27:12,049
- With scissors... - Rock was the answer.

817
00:27:12,050 --> 00:27:14,618
- It's rock. - Without paper...

818
00:27:14,619 --> 00:27:16,049
You got it wrong?

819
00:27:16,050 --> 00:27:17,319
Yes, instead of what wins.

820
00:27:17,320 --> 00:27:18,948
I think I've got it.

821
00:27:18,949 --> 00:27:20,718
- What is it? - If it's without rock,

822
00:27:20,719 --> 00:27:22,888
put out the one that loses to rock.

823
00:27:22,889 --> 00:27:24,089
Try me.

824
00:27:24,090 --> 00:27:26,405
Without rock, rock-paper-scissors

825
00:27:27,129 --> 00:27:29,075
Without paper, rock-paper-scissors

826
00:27:29,560 --> 00:27:31,468
- Okay, I got it. - Me too.

827
00:27:31,469 --> 00:27:32,668
- I get it now. - We'll go again.

828
00:27:32,669 --> 00:27:34,099
- I'll go first. - Sure.

829
00:27:34,100 --> 00:27:35,099
Okay, go ahead.

830
00:27:35,100 --> 00:27:36,499
Without paper, rock-paper-scissors

831
00:27:36,500 --> 00:27:38,039
(Once again)

832
00:27:38,040 --> 00:27:39,868
(Scissors?)

833
00:27:39,869 --> 00:27:43,108
We lost. Game over.

834
00:27:43,109 --> 00:27:45,325
(He's totally embarrassed.)

835
00:27:45,709 --> 00:27:47,479
- But... - Are you kidding me?

836
00:27:47,480 --> 00:27:50,019
You put out the one that loses to the one taken out.

837
00:27:50,020 --> 00:27:51,918
- Right. - Don't think of it like that.

838
00:27:51,919 --> 00:27:53,249
- But... - I can't believe we can't get this.

839
00:27:53,250 --> 00:27:55,865
It's confusing to think what loses to what.

840
00:27:56,659 --> 00:27:59,229
This couldn't be more gratifying. He was like this.

841
00:27:59,230 --> 00:28:00,734
He seemed so confident but...

842
00:28:00,760 --> 00:28:02,428
(He ended up looking like a fool.)

843
00:28:02,429 --> 00:28:04,004
- I get it now. - We'll go again.

844
00:28:04,730 --> 00:28:06,204
With paper, rock-paper-scissors

845
00:28:06,270 --> 00:28:08,575
(He should've put out paper this time.)

846
00:28:09,070 --> 00:28:10,198
- Paper... - Didn't you hear "with"?

847
00:28:10,199 --> 00:28:11,608
- Come on. - With paper!

848
00:28:11,609 --> 00:28:13,208
- With paper. - What?

849
00:28:13,209 --> 00:28:14,479
With paper?

850
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:15,608
- But... - With paper?

851
00:28:15,609 --> 00:28:17,579
Just so you know...

852
00:28:17,580 --> 00:28:19,148
Why are you pretending not to have heard this?

853
00:28:19,149 --> 00:28:21,655
So we just have to put out "paper" in this case?

854
00:28:21,679 --> 00:28:23,079
Let's be honest. You knew.

855
00:28:23,080 --> 00:28:24,688
- I didn't. - You knew...

856
00:28:24,689 --> 00:28:26,218
- this certain rule. - Earlier...

857
00:28:26,219 --> 00:28:28,358
- I'm disappointed in you. - You and I...

858
00:28:28,359 --> 00:28:30,688
Why isn't anyone saying anything?

859
00:28:30,689 --> 00:28:32,805
I've been telling him off.

860
00:28:32,889 --> 00:28:34,858
It was an honest mistake.

861
00:28:34,859 --> 00:28:36,229
(It was an honest mistake.)

862
00:28:36,230 --> 00:28:37,628
(Nodding)

863
00:28:37,629 --> 00:28:39,128
It's as if we've become fools.

864
00:28:39,129 --> 00:28:40,668
Why are we so bad at this?

865
00:28:40,669 --> 00:28:41,868
We'll start with Ji Hyo this time.

866
00:28:41,869 --> 00:28:44,468
Ready... Go.

867
00:28:44,469 --> 00:28:46,115
With scissors, rock-paper-scissors

868
00:28:46,310 --> 00:28:48,009
(She fails by presenting paper.)

869
00:28:48,010 --> 00:28:49,608
- Scissors. - With scissors!

870
00:28:49,609 --> 00:28:51,479
- Scissors. - Let's get her through this first.

871
00:28:51,480 --> 00:28:52,948
We'll start with Ji Hyo.

872
00:28:52,949 --> 00:28:54,479
This is a practice round.

873
00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:56,519
This is flustering. Okay, I'll go first.

874
00:28:56,520 --> 00:28:58,249
I can't believe this. We'll never be able to leave here.

875
00:28:58,250 --> 00:29:00,019
- Again. - We're doomed.

876
00:29:00,020 --> 00:29:01,718
- I can do it now. - Come on.

877
00:29:01,719 --> 00:29:02,865
(Will they be able to successfully win a hint?)

878
00:29:03,290 --> 00:29:05,128
Must the chasers stick together?

879
00:29:05,129 --> 00:29:06,829
Yes, if one gets caught,

880
00:29:06,830 --> 00:29:08,229
the other two may run for it.

881
00:29:08,230 --> 00:29:09,698
Of course, we should run.

882
00:29:09,699 --> 00:29:12,329
However, you must head to the same location next.

883
00:29:12,330 --> 00:29:14,569
That's why we need to decide on where to go in advance.

884
00:29:14,570 --> 00:29:16,299
- I found a cutlet diner. - Search the web.

885
00:29:16,300 --> 00:29:18,108
Secretaries, get to work.

886
00:29:18,109 --> 00:29:19,815
Search the Internet.

887
00:29:20,070 --> 00:29:22,014
You should too unless you want a beating.

888
00:29:22,810 --> 00:29:23,809
(You jerks...)

889
00:29:23,810 --> 00:29:26,878
I can't believe this. What a nice world it is.

890
00:29:26,879 --> 00:29:30,418
After you search online, I'll give you 10 dollars.

891
00:29:30,419 --> 00:29:32,125
(Please shut it.)

892
00:29:32,719 --> 00:29:34,319
- Manage with that. - Buy a beverage.

893
00:29:34,320 --> 00:29:35,395
(By yourself something to drink.)

894
00:29:35,490 --> 00:29:37,158
Let's see. Kim Jong Kook...

895
00:29:37,159 --> 00:29:38,729
Nothing's coming up.

896
00:29:38,730 --> 00:29:40,999
It's because he's not much of a foodie.

897
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:42,158
Exactly.

898
00:29:42,159 --> 00:29:43,905
I found a pork cutlet diner.

899
00:29:44,530 --> 00:29:46,029
- Pork cutlet? - Anyang Loser.

900
00:29:46,030 --> 00:29:48,214
Is that the name of a restaurant?

901
00:29:48,840 --> 00:29:52,684
There's a hangover soup restaurant near his house.

902
00:29:53,070 --> 00:29:55,079
- That's right. - I'll ask his stylist.

903
00:29:55,080 --> 00:29:57,509
Yes, ask her. She'll know.

904
00:29:57,510 --> 00:29:58,885
(They'll ask Ji Seon, Jong Kook's stylist of 5 years.)

905
00:30:00,409 --> 00:30:02,595
- Yes? - Ji Seon.

906
00:30:02,619 --> 00:30:05,118
- We're looking for a restaurant. - Right.

907
00:30:05,119 --> 00:30:07,464
There's a gukbap place Jong Kook goes to often.

908
00:30:08,260 --> 00:30:10,819
I don't know where that is.

909
00:30:10,820 --> 00:30:12,729
(Stylist Ji Seon)

910
00:30:12,730 --> 00:30:14,329
- Hey. - Just tell me.

911
00:30:14,330 --> 00:30:15,599
I really don't know.

912
00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:17,599
- Ji Seon, hold on. - Sorry?

913
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:19,128
- Ji Seon. - Yes?

914
00:30:19,129 --> 00:30:20,799
- It's me. - Right.

915
00:30:20,800 --> 00:30:23,075
You can tell me what you can't tell Kwang Soo.

916
00:30:24,340 --> 00:30:26,968
- There might be a place... - Hold on a second.

917
00:30:26,969 --> 00:30:30,055
Are you perhaps with Jong Kook at the moment?

918
00:30:30,139 --> 00:30:31,779
He's in front of me.

919
00:30:31,780 --> 00:30:33,309
He's in front of you? I'm hanging up.

920
00:30:33,310 --> 00:30:34,418
(Stylist Ji Seon)

921
00:30:34,419 --> 00:30:36,849
(Startled)

922
00:30:36,850 --> 00:30:38,789
Are you insane? Jong Kook's there with her.

923
00:30:38,790 --> 00:30:39,948
They're together?

924
00:30:39,949 --> 00:30:41,259
Jong Kook's right there.

925
00:30:41,260 --> 00:30:43,019
(They almost revealed their destination.)

926
00:30:43,020 --> 00:30:44,019
Why did you call Ji Seon?

927
00:30:44,020 --> 00:30:46,729
- Why Ji Seon of all people? - Why did you call Ji Seon?

928
00:30:46,730 --> 00:30:48,858
(You're so clueless.)

929
00:30:48,859 --> 00:30:50,999
- No one ordered you. - You...

930
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:52,468
You don't think, do you?

931
00:30:52,469 --> 00:30:53,805
You told me to call.

932
00:30:54,500 --> 00:30:56,898
- Unbelievable. - You almost called Kwak Jin.

933
00:30:56,899 --> 00:30:59,585
- That was close. - So who should we call?

934
00:30:59,669 --> 00:31:01,184
Should we call Jong Myung?

935
00:31:01,409 --> 00:31:02,438
Right.

936
00:31:02,439 --> 00:31:04,908
- My eyebrow... - That's right.

937
00:31:04,909 --> 00:31:07,108
- He made it good as new. - I'll call him.

938
00:31:07,109 --> 00:31:08,694
Yes, call him.

939
00:31:08,780 --> 00:31:10,148
Do you know his number?

940
00:31:10,149 --> 00:31:11,464
I'm calling his workplace.

941
00:31:11,719 --> 00:31:12,948
- Wait... - His workplace?

942
00:31:12,949 --> 00:31:14,395
Don't you know his number?

943
00:31:15,060 --> 00:31:17,395
Jong Kook would never guess that we called his brother.

944
00:31:18,330 --> 00:31:19,888
- Maybe he's with a patient. - Hello?

945
00:31:19,889 --> 00:31:21,829
- Jong Myung. - Yes, hi, Jae Seok.

946
00:31:21,830 --> 00:31:23,259
It's me. What were you up to?

947
00:31:23,260 --> 00:31:24,529
I'm waiting for a patient.

948
00:31:24,530 --> 00:31:26,569
Is that so? Well, I'm glad we have some time.

949
00:31:26,570 --> 00:31:28,645
Thanks to you, my eyebrow is as good as new.

950
00:31:28,800 --> 00:31:30,398
- Really? - Thank you so much.

951
00:31:30,399 --> 00:31:33,385
Thanks to you, my sister is living a new life.

952
00:31:33,510 --> 00:31:35,484
- Oh, gosh. - Thank you so much.

953
00:31:35,609 --> 00:31:37,849
- Just stay quiet. - Unbelievable.

954
00:31:37,850 --> 00:31:41,618
Jong Myung, we must go to three places in Anyang...

955
00:31:41,619 --> 00:31:44,019
that are meaningful to Jong Kook.

956
00:31:44,020 --> 00:31:47,249
In high school, he used to go to Anyang First Street...

957
00:31:47,250 --> 00:31:49,218
- a lot. - Anyang First Street?

958
00:31:49,219 --> 00:31:52,029
So the restaurant is there?

959
00:31:52,030 --> 00:31:55,928
- That's right. - Also, if Jong Kook calls,

960
00:31:55,929 --> 00:31:57,729
please tell him that we didn't call you.

961
00:31:57,730 --> 00:31:59,668
- Of course. - Thank you.

962
00:31:59,669 --> 00:32:01,569
- Have a good day then. - You too.

963
00:32:01,570 --> 00:32:03,299
We should search for restaurants on Anyang First Street.

964
00:32:03,300 --> 00:32:04,608
- Right. - We should ask around.

965
00:32:04,609 --> 00:32:07,815
Jong Kook mentioned Anyang First Street a lot.

966
00:32:07,840 --> 00:32:11,108
Let's head their first. All we need is a photo.

967
00:32:11,109 --> 00:32:12,678
(The shopping mall where Jong Kook's signing event took place)

968
00:32:12,679 --> 00:32:14,079
They might not guess this place.

969
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:15,425
Right.

970
00:32:15,520 --> 00:32:18,989
You have arrived at a meaningful spot for Jong Kook.

971
00:32:18,990 --> 00:32:21,358
In order to have this place validated...

972
00:32:21,359 --> 00:32:22,519
There must be a certain way.

973
00:32:22,520 --> 00:32:25,059
You must do exactly what Jong Kook did here.

974
00:32:25,060 --> 00:32:26,264
What?

975
00:32:26,429 --> 00:32:28,799
What on earth are you saying?

976
00:32:28,800 --> 00:32:30,698
I just read this,

977
00:32:30,699 --> 00:32:33,599
but he signed autographs for 110 people that day.

978
00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:34,599
(He signed autographs for 110 people that day.)

979
00:32:34,600 --> 00:32:36,398
He signed autographs for 110 people that day.

980
00:32:36,399 --> 00:32:38,408
Before you're caught by the chasers...

981
00:32:38,409 --> 00:32:41,138
How can we hold a signing event when we're on the run?

982
00:32:41,139 --> 00:32:42,779
You must sign 110 autographs combined.

983
00:32:42,780 --> 00:32:44,108
Who suggested that we come here?

984
00:32:44,109 --> 00:32:45,849
(In anger)

985
00:32:45,850 --> 00:32:47,579
- What? - It was you!

986
00:32:47,580 --> 00:32:48,655
What...

987
00:32:48,879 --> 00:32:52,065
- With the people here? - You thought you were so smart.

988
00:32:52,750 --> 00:32:55,065
(20 minutes ago)

989
00:32:55,260 --> 00:32:58,004
(He kept fussing over the signing event venue.)

990
00:32:58,230 --> 00:33:00,764
- You said no one would think of it. - I should've known.

991
00:33:01,600 --> 00:33:02,799
- But... - At a restaurant,

992
00:33:02,800 --> 00:33:03,999
all we have to do is eat.

993
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:08,444
Before I make rash decisions, you should stop me.

994
00:33:08,669 --> 00:33:09,769
- Right? - But...

995
00:33:09,770 --> 00:33:10,999
- We're done for. - If you went to his school,

996
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:12,339
- you would've taken a class. - Why didn't you tell us?

997
00:33:12,340 --> 00:33:13,509
A class?

998
00:33:13,510 --> 00:33:14,579
I'm glad we didn't go to his high school.

999
00:33:14,580 --> 00:33:16,608
Isn't it a relief that we didn't go to his school?

1000
00:33:16,609 --> 00:33:17,779
It really is.

1001
00:33:17,780 --> 00:33:19,148
If we took a class,

1002
00:33:19,149 --> 00:33:21,418
- we would've been caught. - As if Jong Kook took classes.

1003
00:33:21,419 --> 00:33:22,418
(As if Jong Kook took classes.)

1004
00:33:22,419 --> 00:33:24,519
- In high school... - He probably played soccer.

1005
00:33:24,520 --> 00:33:25,989
Do we hold the signing event inside?

1006
00:33:25,990 --> 00:33:28,589
- The singing event... - We're being chased though.

1007
00:33:28,590 --> 00:33:31,688
Have you ever seen people on the run sign autographs?

1008
00:33:31,689 --> 00:33:33,928
Once we enter the shopping mall,

1009
00:33:33,929 --> 00:33:36,029
our photos will be all over social media.

1010
00:33:36,030 --> 00:33:37,628
In real-time too.

1011
00:33:37,629 --> 00:33:39,774
- We'll get caught immediately. - Then let's hurry.

1012
00:33:39,830 --> 00:33:42,615
- Where do we hold the event? - We'll get caught immediately.

1013
00:33:43,600 --> 00:33:46,444
I'll just sign as many as I can.

1014
00:33:46,709 --> 00:33:49,108
Hello. Did Kim Jong Kook hold...

1015
00:33:49,109 --> 00:33:50,708
a signing event here recently?

1016
00:33:50,709 --> 00:33:51,948
- A signing event. - Where?

1017
00:33:51,949 --> 00:33:53,249
- On the 2nd floor. - 2nd floor?

1018
00:33:53,250 --> 00:33:54,618
- The second floor? - Right down there.

1019
00:33:54,619 --> 00:33:55,979
Right down there? Thank you.

1020
00:33:55,980 --> 00:33:57,519
It was downstairs.

1021
00:33:57,520 --> 00:33:59,349
- Was it here? - Hello.

1022
00:33:59,350 --> 00:34:00,888
- Come and get your autographs. - There?

1023
00:34:00,889 --> 00:34:02,918
- The stairs? Thanks. - Thank you.

1024
00:34:02,919 --> 00:34:04,628
We're here to hold a signing event too.

1025
00:34:04,629 --> 00:34:06,128
- You should come by. - Please spread the word.

1026
00:34:06,129 --> 00:34:07,628
If it's all right with the customers, I mean.

1027
00:34:07,629 --> 00:34:09,329
About 100 will do.

1028
00:34:09,330 --> 00:34:11,099
We need pen and paper.

1029
00:34:11,100 --> 00:34:12,569
Where are the pen and paper?

1030
00:34:12,570 --> 00:34:14,075
Must we get some ourselves?

1031
00:34:14,299 --> 00:34:16,468
- Where are they? - Shouldn't you provide that?

1032
00:34:16,469 --> 00:34:17,798
Try and get them yourselves.

1033
00:34:17,799 --> 00:34:19,769
- Paper... - Guys, sit for now.

1034
00:34:19,770 --> 00:34:21,655
- But the paper... - Have a seat.

1035
00:34:21,909 --> 00:34:23,609
Where do we get paper?

1036
00:34:23,610 --> 00:34:25,309
- Here you go. - Hold on.

1037
00:34:25,310 --> 00:34:27,109
- Who has paper? - Slowly, please.

1038
00:34:27,110 --> 00:34:29,079
- Hello. - Gosh, thank you.

1039
00:34:29,080 --> 00:34:30,979
Thank you so much.

1040
00:34:30,980 --> 00:34:33,318
(The Paper Angel comes forward.)

1041
00:34:33,319 --> 00:34:35,694
Thank you so much. She gave us paper.

1042
00:34:35,889 --> 00:34:36,919
- My gosh. - Hold on.

1043
00:34:36,920 --> 00:34:39,229
We're good. Let's get this started.

1044
00:34:39,230 --> 00:34:42,075
Also, keep an eye out for the chasers.

1045
00:34:42,130 --> 00:34:43,774
Kwang Soo, come on.

1046
00:34:43,900 --> 00:34:46,669
I'm sorry, but we need to rush this a little bit.

1047
00:34:46,670 --> 00:34:47,669
(The random signing event is a success though.)

1048
00:34:47,670 --> 00:34:50,298
We're being chased, so...

1049
00:34:50,299 --> 00:34:51,609
- we're sorry. - Sorry.

1050
00:34:51,610 --> 00:34:53,068
- Thank you. - Thank you.

1051
00:34:53,069 --> 00:34:54,238
Thank you!

1052
00:34:54,239 --> 00:34:56,079
- Here you go. - Thank you.

1053
00:34:56,080 --> 00:34:58,084
- We're in trouble. - Thank you.

1054
00:34:58,610 --> 00:35:00,709
- Hello, ma'am. - Hello.

1055
00:35:00,710 --> 00:35:02,095
Thank you.

1056
00:35:02,350 --> 00:35:03,419
Always stay healthy.

1057
00:35:03,420 --> 00:35:04,765
My goodness.

1058
00:35:05,719 --> 00:35:07,425
We don't have the time.

1059
00:35:07,489 --> 00:35:09,365
- Thank you. - Here you go.

1060
00:35:09,619 --> 00:35:10,689
Thank you.

1061
00:35:10,690 --> 00:35:13,229
We're being chased, so we could run for it at any time.

1062
00:35:13,230 --> 00:35:14,698
We apologize in advance.

1063
00:35:14,699 --> 00:35:15,859
Thank you.

1064
00:35:15,860 --> 00:35:16,935
(Will they be able to finish the signing event?)

1065
00:35:17,360 --> 00:35:19,129
Hold on a second.

1066
00:35:19,130 --> 00:35:21,198
Haha, get a grip on yourself.

1067
00:35:21,199 --> 00:35:23,039
- We need to do this. - What loses to scissors?

1068
00:35:23,040 --> 00:35:24,939
- Scissors? - It's paper.

1069
00:35:24,940 --> 00:35:26,338
Without scissors, rock-paper-scissors

1070
00:35:26,339 --> 00:35:27,785
(Without scissors, rock-paper-scissors.)

1071
00:35:28,239 --> 00:35:31,138
(Finally, Haha wins by drawing with paper!)

1072
00:35:31,139 --> 00:35:33,508
Finally, we got it.

1073
00:35:33,509 --> 00:35:35,919
- This is so annoying. - Is this something to celebrate?

1074
00:35:35,920 --> 00:35:37,519
- This should've been easy. - It was annoying.

1075
00:35:37,520 --> 00:35:39,048
I'm actually dizzy.

1076
00:35:39,049 --> 00:35:41,164
You can pick a card then.

1077
00:35:42,089 --> 00:35:44,118
The one that tells us their whereabouts is best.

1078
00:35:44,119 --> 00:35:45,488
So...

1079
00:35:45,489 --> 00:35:49,305
(Which card did they select?)

1080
00:35:50,029 --> 00:35:51,729
- Conversation... - The Listen-in Card.

1081
00:35:51,730 --> 00:35:53,099
- Okay, good. - What a bummer.

1082
00:35:53,100 --> 00:35:54,405
(What a bummer.)

1083
00:35:54,799 --> 00:35:57,198
(30-second Listen-in Card)

1084
00:35:57,199 --> 00:35:59,468
A place that is meaningful to me?

1085
00:35:59,469 --> 00:36:01,555
(It's not what they wanted, but they call the chasers.)

1086
00:36:03,310 --> 00:36:04,925
- I should listen. - Right.

1087
00:36:05,810 --> 00:36:08,419
- All right. - You're down to 30 people.

1088
00:36:08,420 --> 00:36:10,419
What? 30 people?

1089
00:36:10,420 --> 00:36:12,789
- Yes, you're down to 30 people. - My gosh.

1090
00:36:12,790 --> 00:36:15,618
(Why are they saying they have 30 people left?)

1091
00:36:15,619 --> 00:36:16,919
30 people left?

1092
00:36:16,920 --> 00:36:17,919
(Why are they saying they have 30 people left?)

1093
00:36:17,920 --> 00:36:19,405
My gosh.

1094
00:36:19,429 --> 00:36:22,428
(The runaways were signing autographs.)

1095
00:36:22,429 --> 00:36:24,975
(The call was connected at a crucial moment.)

1096
00:36:25,029 --> 00:36:27,198
Gosh, this isn't easy.

1097
00:36:27,199 --> 00:36:28,414
A signing event.

1098
00:36:28,600 --> 00:36:30,298
(They have 30 people left?)

1099
00:36:30,299 --> 00:36:31,669
(A signing event)

1100
00:36:31,670 --> 00:36:33,939
- "Thank you." - A signing event.

1101
00:36:33,940 --> 00:36:35,479
It sounds like their signing autographs.

1102
00:36:35,480 --> 00:36:36,939
- "They are 30 people left." - Thank you!

1103
00:36:36,940 --> 00:36:38,325
- I heard you, I'll give it back. - It's a place with a lot of people.

1104
00:36:39,110 --> 00:36:40,209
I'll give it back.

1105
00:36:40,210 --> 00:36:41,209
(Haha takes his time.)

1106
00:36:41,210 --> 00:36:42,948
Don't you think they're doing a signing event?

1107
00:36:42,949 --> 00:36:44,055
It's a signing event.

1108
00:36:44,380 --> 00:36:45,919
- It's a signing event. - "There are 30 people left."

1109
00:36:45,920 --> 00:36:47,318
- Someone said, "Thank you." - A signing event?

1110
00:36:47,319 --> 00:36:48,689
Have you ever done a signing event here?

1111
00:36:48,690 --> 00:36:49,988
- I did it recently. - Where was it?

1112
00:36:49,989 --> 00:36:51,464
- You did one here too. - Yes.

1113
00:36:51,730 --> 00:36:53,588
- Near Anyang Station. - Near Anyang Station.

1114
00:36:53,589 --> 00:36:54,859
When was it? Was it recent?

1115
00:36:54,860 --> 00:36:56,258
- Let's go to Anyang Station then. - It was near Anyang Station.

1116
00:36:56,259 --> 00:36:57,629
Let's hurry.

1117
00:36:57,630 --> 00:36:59,075
We have to hurry and catch them.

1118
00:36:59,569 --> 00:37:01,675
- Hi. - Hi.

1119
00:37:01,839 --> 00:37:03,338
(The signing event is being held at a mall near Anyang Station.)

1120
00:37:03,339 --> 00:37:04,515
- Here you go. - Thank you.

1121
00:37:04,569 --> 00:37:06,214
Aren't we supposed to be on the run?

1122
00:37:08,409 --> 00:37:10,385
We're runaways.

1123
00:37:10,409 --> 00:37:12,425
- But everyone can see us. - We're sorry.

1124
00:37:12,549 --> 00:37:13,809
If they find us, everything will be over.

1125
00:37:13,810 --> 00:37:15,218
We won't be able to do anything.

1126
00:37:15,219 --> 00:37:16,925
We're so exposed.

1127
00:37:17,020 --> 00:37:18,749
If you see other Running Man members,

1128
00:37:18,750 --> 00:37:20,218
please tell us.

1129
00:37:20,219 --> 00:37:23,234
(We don't care who comes. We're busy taking photos.)

1130
00:37:23,520 --> 00:37:25,028
Check social media.

1131
00:37:25,029 --> 00:37:26,705
We're allowed to use it.

1132
00:37:27,230 --> 00:37:29,205
Why did he say, "There are 30 people left"?

1133
00:37:30,029 --> 00:37:32,175
- What? - 11 minutes ago...

1134
00:37:32,299 --> 00:37:34,499
- Someone posted an autograph. - Were we right?

1135
00:37:34,500 --> 00:37:36,374
- Where? - It's at the shopping mall.

1136
00:37:36,500 --> 00:37:37,599
- Is it? - Look at the floor.

1137
00:37:37,600 --> 00:37:39,408
- That's right. It's at the mall. - Someone posted an autograph.

1138
00:37:39,409 --> 00:37:40,968
- Unbelievable. How did you find it? - Three people did.

1139
00:37:40,969 --> 00:37:42,338
Let's go.

1140
00:37:42,339 --> 00:37:43,484
(The chasers even have evidence now.)

1141
00:37:44,139 --> 00:37:46,349
We have to leave soon.

1142
00:37:46,350 --> 00:37:47,425
How many people are left?

1143
00:37:48,279 --> 00:37:49,725
Five people to go.

1144
00:37:49,779 --> 00:37:51,024
We have to hurry.

1145
00:37:51,179 --> 00:37:53,048
We have to hurry. Thank you.

1146
00:37:53,049 --> 00:37:55,495
We can give our autographs to only five more people. Sorry.

1147
00:37:55,860 --> 00:37:57,194
We're sorry.

1148
00:37:57,659 --> 00:37:59,504
We'll get out here.

1149
00:37:59,589 --> 00:38:00,905
The car should go to the parking lot.

1150
00:38:00,989 --> 00:38:02,104
Let's go.

1151
00:38:02,199 --> 00:38:03,975
I think we should run to the parking lot now.

1152
00:38:04,560 --> 00:38:05,928
- Over there. - Are we going up?

1153
00:38:05,929 --> 00:38:07,944
Ask people if they've seen the other members.

1154
00:38:08,069 --> 00:38:09,975
- Here you go. Thank you. - Thank you.

1155
00:38:10,139 --> 00:38:11,714
(Worried)

1156
00:38:12,110 --> 00:38:14,544
- Over there. - Have you seen Yu Jae Seok?

1157
00:38:15,339 --> 00:38:16,615
Have you seen Yu Jae Seok?

1158
00:38:17,580 --> 00:38:19,854
(The runaways speed up.)

1159
00:38:20,080 --> 00:38:21,948
- Have you seen Yu Jae Seok? - I saw him on the third floor.

1160
00:38:21,949 --> 00:38:23,849
- They're on the 3rd floor! - The 3rd floor?

1161
00:38:23,850 --> 00:38:25,194
(They received an important piece of information.)

1162
00:38:25,219 --> 00:38:26,365
Let's go now.

1163
00:38:26,889 --> 00:38:27,964
The last one.

1164
00:38:27,989 --> 00:38:29,765
Would they have gone straight to the basement?

1165
00:38:29,920 --> 00:38:31,635
- That was the last one. - That was the last one.

1166
00:38:31,690 --> 00:38:32,789
- We're sorry. - Thank you.

1167
00:38:32,790 --> 00:38:34,705
We're so sorry. We have to run.

1168
00:38:35,759 --> 00:38:38,745
(I must be getting closer.)

1169
00:38:38,929 --> 00:38:40,899
Isn't this the place?

1170
00:38:40,900 --> 00:38:44,568
(Will the chasers catch the runaways?)

1171
00:38:44,569 --> 00:38:46,615
- Isn't this the place? - Is it here?

1172
00:38:47,310 --> 00:38:48,508
What...

1173
00:38:48,509 --> 00:38:49,579
(What?)

1174
00:38:49,580 --> 00:38:51,555
- I saw these stairs in the picture. - Was it here?

1175
00:38:51,779 --> 00:38:53,385
Have you seen Yu Jae Seok?

1176
00:38:53,509 --> 00:38:55,079
- Have they left? - They did a signing event here.

1177
00:38:55,080 --> 00:38:56,349
- They did? - They've already left.

1178
00:38:56,350 --> 00:38:57,524
When did they leave?

1179
00:38:57,580 --> 00:38:59,225
- 10 minutes ago. - 5 minutes ago?

1180
00:38:59,350 --> 00:39:01,124
- They left five minutes ago. - Let's leave.

1181
00:39:01,190 --> 00:39:02,459
We should leave.

1182
00:39:02,460 --> 00:39:03,734
- Five minutes ago. - We should go.

1183
00:39:03,819 --> 00:39:06,758
Your mission was a success at this place.

1184
00:39:06,759 --> 00:39:08,059
- Yes! - Let's hurry.

1185
00:39:08,060 --> 00:39:09,734
We're really sorry.

1186
00:39:09,960 --> 00:39:12,599
- We have to run now. - We're sorry.

1187
00:39:12,600 --> 00:39:14,499
- We're sorry. Bye! - Thank you!

1188
00:39:14,500 --> 00:39:15,975
- Bye! - Thank you.

1189
00:39:16,069 --> 00:39:18,175
- Bye! - Thank you very much.

1190
00:39:19,409 --> 00:39:22,109
- I can feel them near. - Guys, see?

1191
00:39:22,110 --> 00:39:23,955
(The 3 petty criminals successfully held a signing event on the run.)

1192
00:39:24,480 --> 00:39:25,584
I've never been...

1193
00:39:25,650 --> 00:39:27,624
so nervous at a signing event.

1194
00:39:28,949 --> 00:39:30,425
I don't even know how we did it.

1195
00:39:30,920 --> 00:39:33,464
- Should we go to First Street? - Let's go.

1196
00:39:33,489 --> 00:39:35,289
We should ask as soon as we enter...

1197
00:39:35,290 --> 00:39:36,865
- if Jong Kook has been there. - Right.

1198
00:39:36,989 --> 00:39:38,234
We have to be strategic.

1199
00:39:39,190 --> 00:39:40,528
There you go again.

1200
00:39:40,529 --> 00:39:42,274
Jae Seok is doing it again.

1201
00:39:42,299 --> 00:39:44,599
Don't talk so confidently.

1202
00:39:44,600 --> 00:39:46,475
Why are we here in the first place?

1203
00:39:46,500 --> 00:39:48,175
Our mission succeeded because I brought you guys here.

1204
00:39:48,199 --> 00:39:50,499
If I had let you do whatever you wanted,

1205
00:39:50,500 --> 00:39:51,968
you'd both be out by now.

1206
00:39:51,969 --> 00:39:53,185
At the signing event, you were like this.

1207
00:39:53,440 --> 00:39:54,944
(Nervous)

1208
00:39:55,810 --> 00:39:59,024
(He was obviously scared.)

1209
00:39:59,509 --> 00:40:01,649
Please take us to Anyang First Street.

1210
00:40:01,650 --> 00:40:03,024
(The 3 runaways are on their way to Anyang First Street.)

1211
00:40:03,119 --> 00:40:04,479
I'll make sure you guys take 1,000 dollars home each.

1212
00:40:04,480 --> 00:40:05,564
(Jae Seok is still confident.)

1213
00:40:05,920 --> 00:40:07,919
They might show up out of nowhere and stop our car.

1214
00:40:07,920 --> 00:40:09,718
(They're on alert.)

1215
00:40:09,719 --> 00:40:11,365
- Do you see anything? - Isn't that their van?

1216
00:40:11,730 --> 00:40:12,905
They're here.

1217
00:40:12,929 --> 00:40:14,559
- They're going up. - Turn off all the lights.

1218
00:40:14,560 --> 00:40:18,175
(The runaways even turn off their lights.)

1219
00:40:19,600 --> 00:40:21,738
- What's wrong? - They're on the other side.

1220
00:40:21,739 --> 00:40:24,515
- It says, "SBS". - Lock the doors.

1221
00:40:24,569 --> 00:40:25,714
They're here?

1222
00:40:26,469 --> 00:40:27,685
Hey, let's hide.

1223
00:40:29,040 --> 00:40:31,984
(They're scared.)

1224
00:40:32,850 --> 00:40:34,309
- Guys. - Let's hurry.

1225
00:40:34,310 --> 00:40:35,579
We almost got caught.

1226
00:40:35,580 --> 00:40:36,655
(They're extremely nervous.)

1227
00:40:37,219 --> 00:40:38,689
We should go somewhere else.

1228
00:40:38,690 --> 00:40:39,789
(The chasers are circling around the building.)

1229
00:40:39,790 --> 00:40:42,258
They might be done earlier than we thought.

1230
00:40:42,259 --> 00:40:44,294
Exactly. We have to catch them soon.

1231
00:40:44,389 --> 00:40:46,035
We should catch two first.

1232
00:40:46,589 --> 00:40:47,905
So Min, give them a call.

1233
00:40:48,900 --> 00:40:50,698
They asked Jong Kook's friends too.

1234
00:40:50,699 --> 00:40:53,399
- They might go to Jong Kook's home. - My home?

1235
00:40:53,400 --> 00:40:54,428
Why?

1236
00:40:54,429 --> 00:40:55,714
It's possible.

1237
00:40:55,799 --> 00:40:57,368
- I don't think so. - Se Chan.

1238
00:40:57,369 --> 00:40:58,944
- Se Chan. - Yes?

1239
00:40:59,409 --> 00:41:00,644
What are you doing?

1240
00:41:01,110 --> 00:41:02,709
- Well... - Listen up.

1241
00:41:02,710 --> 00:41:04,008
(Haha sees something.)

1242
00:41:04,009 --> 00:41:05,948
If you want to catch us, bring 4,000 dollars.

1243
00:41:05,949 --> 00:41:07,055
What?

1244
00:41:07,080 --> 00:41:08,624
Do you guys see us?

1245
00:41:08,650 --> 00:41:09,778
What? Where?

1246
00:41:09,779 --> 00:41:11,425
Do you guys see us?

1247
00:41:11,449 --> 00:41:12,548
What? Where?

1248
00:41:12,549 --> 00:41:14,164
- Is that their van? - Don't you see us?

1249
00:41:14,520 --> 00:41:16,734
- Where? - That's their van.

1250
00:41:18,159 --> 00:41:19,305
- What? - There they are.

1251
00:41:20,290 --> 00:41:21,874
What should we do?

1252
00:41:22,330 --> 00:41:23,635
They saw us.

1253
00:41:23,730 --> 00:41:24,935
We have to hurry.

1254
00:41:25,069 --> 00:41:27,198
- Where? - That's their van.

1255
00:41:27,199 --> 00:41:29,745
- Is that their van? - You guys see us, right?

1256
00:41:30,299 --> 00:41:31,468
- It's their van. - Really?

1257
00:41:31,469 --> 00:41:32,609
Let's follow them.

1258
00:41:32,610 --> 00:41:34,238
- It's definitely their van. - It is.

1259
00:41:34,239 --> 00:41:35,379
Are you sure?

1260
00:41:35,380 --> 00:41:37,584
- Do you see us? There they are! - There they are!

1261
00:41:37,610 --> 00:41:40,084
- Should we chase them down? - They're leaving.

1262
00:41:40,679 --> 00:41:42,718
- Where are they heading? - Where are they heading?

1263
00:41:42,719 --> 00:41:43,778
They're heading downtown.

1264
00:41:43,779 --> 00:41:45,624
Let me see where they turn. Are they turning right?

1265
00:41:45,719 --> 00:41:46,894
Where are they going?

1266
00:41:47,089 --> 00:41:48,294
We have to speed up.

1267
00:41:48,560 --> 00:41:49,794
Oh, wait.

1268
00:41:50,290 --> 00:41:51,694
Don't honk like that.

1269
00:41:51,730 --> 00:41:53,135
They'll find us.

1270
00:41:53,589 --> 00:41:56,175
If you honk, they'll find us.

1271
00:41:57,199 --> 00:41:58,368
This is not good.

1272
00:41:58,369 --> 00:42:00,245
They saw us. If we continue this way,

1273
00:42:00,369 --> 00:42:02,439
they'll know we're heading to First Street.

1274
00:42:02,440 --> 00:42:04,075
We have no choice.

1275
00:42:04,100 --> 00:42:05,638
- They turned in that direction. - They turned in that direction.

1276
00:42:05,639 --> 00:42:07,138
- Where are they heading? - It gave me goosebumps.

1277
00:42:07,139 --> 00:42:08,885
- They're heading downtown. - Downtown?

1278
00:42:10,110 --> 00:42:11,408
- Get in. - Okay.

1279
00:42:11,409 --> 00:42:12,908
Is that really their van?

1280
00:42:12,909 --> 00:42:14,825
- It is. - Gosh.

1281
00:42:14,909 --> 00:42:17,349
- I'm 100 percent sure. - It gave me goosebumps.

1282
00:42:17,350 --> 00:42:18,618
How did they pass right by us?

1283
00:42:18,619 --> 00:42:20,218
- This is frustrating. - It was like a movie.

1284
00:42:20,219 --> 00:42:22,059
We'll have to follow them in that direction too.

1285
00:42:22,060 --> 00:42:23,318
They must have circled around...

1286
00:42:23,319 --> 00:42:24,789
- to see if we were here. - Probably.

1287
00:42:24,790 --> 00:42:27,234
- Or were they watching us? - That's possible.

1288
00:42:27,989 --> 00:42:29,899
So they went in that direction?

1289
00:42:29,900 --> 00:42:33,129
(Jong Kook is thinking hard.)

1290
00:42:33,130 --> 00:42:35,644
Can you think of any places in that direction?

1291
00:42:36,040 --> 00:42:37,698
(Where would they go in Anyang?)

1292
00:42:37,699 --> 00:42:38,944
Did they go to a pool hall?

1293
00:42:40,810 --> 00:42:42,809
(The runaways successfully escaped.)

1294
00:42:42,810 --> 00:42:45,408
If we go to First Street, we'll be exposed, right?

1295
00:42:45,409 --> 00:42:46,609
- Definitely. - Let me tell you something.

1296
00:42:46,610 --> 00:42:48,185
So Min just messaged me.

1297
00:42:49,679 --> 00:42:52,024
"If you promise me half of your prize money,"

1298
00:42:52,319 --> 00:42:54,488
"I'll make sure..."

1299
00:42:54,489 --> 00:42:56,559
"you survive."

1300
00:42:56,560 --> 00:42:57,789
She wants to be a spy?

1301
00:42:57,790 --> 00:42:59,705
That's the message she sent me.

1302
00:42:59,889 --> 00:43:01,059
- Kwang Soo. - But I said no.

1303
00:43:01,060 --> 00:43:02,499
- Let me see. - Let me see.

1304
00:43:02,500 --> 00:43:03,734
(Kwang Soo refused to betray his team members?)

1305
00:43:03,759 --> 00:43:05,599
- "It doesn't sound bad"? Hold on. - That's not it.

1306
00:43:05,600 --> 00:43:07,004
"It doesn't sound bad"? Let me see.

1307
00:43:07,029 --> 00:43:08,774
Kwang Soo. Seriously.

1308
00:43:08,900 --> 00:43:11,414
- Look. "It doesn't sound bad." - Gosh.

1309
00:43:11,500 --> 00:43:14,609
- Look. Kwang Soo. - "It doesn't sound bad"?

1310
00:43:14,610 --> 00:43:16,778
- Gosh. What is this? - Are you serious?

1311
00:43:16,779 --> 00:43:19,149
How could you do this?

1312
00:43:19,150 --> 00:43:21,185
I was going to say no.

1313
00:43:22,619 --> 00:43:23,894
- We're here. - Where are we?

1314
00:43:24,049 --> 00:43:25,818
You are now at First Street.

1315
00:43:25,819 --> 00:43:27,425
I think we'll get caught.

1316
00:43:28,790 --> 00:43:30,664
- Gosh. - By the way,

1317
00:43:30,989 --> 00:43:34,164
- They saw where we were going. - we'll waste too much time, right?

1318
00:43:34,190 --> 00:43:36,658
Think about it.

1319
00:43:36,659 --> 00:43:39,504
Let's say we eat something here.

1320
00:43:40,170 --> 00:43:42,868
It'll be the same even if we go to the seolleongtang restaurant.

1321
00:43:42,869 --> 00:43:46,345
(The seolleongtang restaurant?)

1322
00:43:47,440 --> 00:43:48,908
(The runaways had contacted Jong Kook's manager.)

1323
00:43:48,909 --> 00:43:50,484
- Hi, Se Chan. - Hi. Are you busy?

1324
00:43:50,810 --> 00:43:52,008
No, I'm not.

1325
00:43:52,009 --> 00:43:54,209
Do you know if there are any restaurants...

1326
00:43:54,210 --> 00:43:55,894
Jong Kook often goes to in Anyang?

1327
00:43:56,049 --> 00:43:57,178
Or any shops?

1328
00:43:57,179 --> 00:43:58,919
There's a seolleongtang restaurant...

1329
00:43:58,920 --> 00:44:00,419
near the intersection.

1330
00:44:00,420 --> 00:44:02,095
- A seolleongtang restaurant? - Yes.

1331
00:44:02,190 --> 00:44:04,118
- Really? - Yes.

1332
00:44:04,119 --> 00:44:05,959
- He goes there often. - Ask him if there's another place.

1333
00:44:05,960 --> 00:44:08,528
It's open 24 hours a day, so he often goes there after work.

1334
00:44:08,529 --> 00:44:10,205
Which high school did Jong Kook go to?

1335
00:44:10,230 --> 00:44:11,705
- Sinsung High School. - Sinsung High School.

1336
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:13,245
Then let's go there.

1337
00:44:13,270 --> 00:44:14,329
Okay. Thank you.

1338
00:44:14,330 --> 00:44:16,738
(They made the manager believe they were heading to the school.)

1339
00:44:16,739 --> 00:44:18,568
- Let's go. - Let's go to the restaurant.

1340
00:44:18,569 --> 00:44:19,785
- That'd be better. - The thing is,

1341
00:44:19,969 --> 00:44:21,444
if we go in here,

1342
00:44:21,469 --> 00:44:23,678
we'll get lost and waste time.

1343
00:44:23,679 --> 00:44:25,254
Also, they already saw where we were going.

1344
00:44:26,310 --> 00:44:27,624
My IQ is over 100.

1345
00:44:27,679 --> 00:44:30,495
(Why does he suddenly reveal his IQ?)

1346
00:44:30,580 --> 00:44:32,124
Whose IQ isn't over 100?

1347
00:44:32,350 --> 00:44:34,194
I bet not all of us have an IQ over 100.

1348
00:44:34,549 --> 00:44:36,218
It's possible.

1349
00:44:36,219 --> 00:44:37,635
- Mine is over 100. - It's definitely possible.

1350
00:44:37,719 --> 00:44:39,059
I'm on Jae Seok's side.

1351
00:44:39,060 --> 00:44:40,829
What are you talking about? There's a reason for suspicion.

1352
00:44:40,830 --> 00:44:43,635
- If we divide... - Let's put it this way.

1353
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:45,669
The sum of our IQs might not be over 300.

1354
00:44:45,670 --> 00:44:47,305
(It's simple.)

1355
00:44:47,400 --> 00:44:48,528
Right?

1356
00:44:48,529 --> 00:44:50,274
- Do you feel better now? - I feel better now.

1357
00:44:50,569 --> 00:44:52,144
- It's possible. - Okay.

1358
00:44:52,409 --> 00:44:53,838
It might not be over 300.

1359
00:44:53,839 --> 00:44:55,414
(Feeling better, they head to the seolleongtang restaurant.)

1360
00:44:55,739 --> 00:44:57,439
Gosh, this is frustrating.

1361
00:44:57,440 --> 00:45:01,325
(Not knowing where to go, the chasers call someone.)

1362
00:45:01,509 --> 00:45:02,649
Let's catch them soon.

1363
00:45:02,650 --> 00:45:04,349
- Hi, Haha. - Hi, Gap Jin.

1364
00:45:04,350 --> 00:45:06,064
- Hi, Gap Jin. - Yes?

1365
00:45:06,250 --> 00:45:08,564
- I have many questions for you. - You do?

1366
00:45:08,619 --> 00:45:10,964
You want to go home early today, don't you?

1367
00:45:11,319 --> 00:45:12,559
- Me? - Yes.

1368
00:45:12,560 --> 00:45:13,865
I always do.

1369
00:45:14,360 --> 00:45:17,059
- Then give us some information. - It's tempting.

1370
00:45:17,060 --> 00:45:18,305
What did you tell them?

1371
00:45:18,770 --> 00:45:20,444
- What did I tell them? - Yes.

1372
00:45:20,830 --> 00:45:23,568
- Jong Kook's favorite restaurant. - A restaurant?

1373
00:45:23,569 --> 00:45:25,345
(He tells them everything.)

1374
00:45:25,739 --> 00:45:27,408
- Oh, that place. - You know which one?

1375
00:45:27,409 --> 00:45:28,838
Of course, I do.

1376
00:45:28,839 --> 00:45:30,579
Isn't it near Jong Kook's home?

1377
00:45:30,580 --> 00:45:31,738
It's right next to my home.

1378
00:45:31,739 --> 00:45:34,249
- What else did you tell them? - What did you tell them?

1379
00:45:34,250 --> 00:45:35,955
That Jong Kook...

1380
00:45:36,250 --> 00:45:39,548
- went to Sinsung High School. - That's right.

1381
00:45:39,549 --> 00:45:40,919
(He even mentions the school, which was a bait.)

1382
00:45:40,920 --> 00:45:43,289
- They probably went to the school. - That must be it.

1383
00:45:43,290 --> 00:45:44,988
I love it.

1384
00:45:44,989 --> 00:45:46,329
Gap Jin, thank you.

1385
00:45:46,330 --> 00:45:49,734
Gap Jin, call me if you remember anything else.

1386
00:45:49,860 --> 00:45:50,928
Okay, I will.

1387
00:45:50,929 --> 00:45:53,205
Thank you. Get ready to go home early!

1388
00:45:53,270 --> 00:45:55,368
- Okay! - Okay!

1389
00:45:55,369 --> 00:45:58,169
It's either the restaurant or Sinsung High School.

1390
00:45:58,170 --> 00:46:00,584
- What's in that direction? - Is your home there?

1391
00:46:00,670 --> 00:46:01,738
Yes, my home is in that direction.

1392
00:46:01,739 --> 00:46:03,238
- Let's go there. - The thing is,

1393
00:46:03,239 --> 00:46:04,885
it's one p.m. right now.

1394
00:46:04,909 --> 00:46:06,079
- They must be going for lunch. - It's lunchtime.

1395
00:46:06,080 --> 00:46:07,709
- Should we check the restaurant? - Yes.

1396
00:46:07,710 --> 00:46:09,854
- They must be stalling for time. - Let's go there.

1397
00:46:10,449 --> 00:46:11,778
(They both head to the same place. What will happen?)

1398
00:46:11,779 --> 00:46:13,765
We won't even have time to enjoy the seolleongtang.

1399
00:46:13,790 --> 00:46:15,164
We have to drink it.

1400
00:46:15,759 --> 00:46:17,865
- Even if we burn our mouths. - Right.

1401
00:46:18,190 --> 00:46:20,664
(Glancing)

1402
00:46:21,560 --> 00:46:24,035
(Se Chan fiddles with his phone.)

1403
00:46:24,360 --> 00:46:26,599
Even if they win...

1404
00:46:26,600 --> 00:46:28,169
Hey. What are you doing? Let me see.

1405
00:46:28,170 --> 00:46:29,374
It's nothing.

1406
00:46:29,900 --> 00:46:30,939
(Se Chan is panicking.)

1407
00:46:30,940 --> 00:46:32,269
- It's nothing. - Let me see.

1408
00:46:32,270 --> 00:46:33,468
- I swear. - Give it to me.

1409
00:46:33,469 --> 00:46:35,914
I wasn't doing anything. Come on.

1410
00:46:36,040 --> 00:46:37,285
- Gosh. - "Haha, tell me where you are."

1411
00:46:37,409 --> 00:46:39,879
- Seriously, you're unbelievable. - It's not like that.

1412
00:46:39,880 --> 00:46:41,879
- It's not me. - If you continue to be this way,

1413
00:46:41,880 --> 00:46:43,579
- we will confiscate your cellphone. - Are you going to be this way?

1414
00:46:43,580 --> 00:46:45,149
Why did you ask?

1415
00:46:45,150 --> 00:46:46,849
I wanted to help the team...

1416
00:46:46,850 --> 00:46:49,359
by obtaining information.

1417
00:46:49,360 --> 00:46:50,519
Were you going to go there?

1418
00:46:50,520 --> 00:46:52,329
- Don't be ridiculous. - Were you?

1419
00:46:52,330 --> 00:46:54,658
Hey, I am the youngest member of this team.

1420
00:46:54,659 --> 00:46:56,329
No funny businesses. Confiscate his phone.

1421
00:46:56,330 --> 00:46:57,829
- This is driving me crazy. - Don't contact anyone.

1422
00:46:57,830 --> 00:46:59,845
Then give me your phone.

1423
00:46:59,900 --> 00:47:01,245
Give me your phone.

1424
00:47:02,139 --> 00:47:03,274
- Give me your phone. - Jae Seok.

1425
00:47:03,339 --> 00:47:05,015
Why are you fiddling with your phone?

1426
00:47:05,069 --> 00:47:06,914
What are you doing on your phone?

1427
00:47:07,339 --> 00:47:09,309
Someone contacted you, right?

1428
00:47:09,310 --> 00:47:10,939
- Did someone contact you? - Of course not.

1429
00:47:10,940 --> 00:47:12,655
Let's do this. Let's keep our phones,

1430
00:47:13,150 --> 00:47:16,024
but keep it out of sight. We need to call if we split up.

1431
00:47:16,420 --> 00:47:17,879
That's true.

1432
00:47:17,880 --> 00:47:18,888
We need to call each other.

1433
00:47:18,889 --> 00:47:19,988
Don't come up with a dirty scheme.

1434
00:47:19,989 --> 00:47:21,588
- I will keep my phone in my bag. - I won't take mine out.

1435
00:47:21,589 --> 00:47:24,059
Being a runaway is hard enough.

1436
00:47:24,060 --> 00:47:26,988
I don't want to have a war of nerves with you guys.

1437
00:47:26,989 --> 00:47:29,734
- I wanted to obtain information. - Let's not waste our energy.

1438
00:47:30,230 --> 00:47:31,675
Okay?

1439
00:47:32,170 --> 00:47:34,644
There is no way to obtain information.

1440
00:47:35,199 --> 00:47:37,198
Jong Kook, is there a story related to this place?

1441
00:47:37,199 --> 00:47:40,309
This underpass. It looks a bit...

1442
00:47:40,310 --> 00:47:41,408
Every place has a story.

1443
00:47:41,409 --> 00:47:42,709
(Of course, there is.)

1444
00:47:42,710 --> 00:47:46,084
Tell us. Before these apartments got built...

1445
00:47:46,179 --> 00:47:48,524
- This place was farmland. - Really?

1446
00:47:48,710 --> 00:47:50,379
You know Pyeongchon-dong in Anyang, right?

1447
00:47:50,380 --> 00:47:51,894
When I was in school,

1448
00:47:52,089 --> 00:47:54,894
Pyeongchon-dong was farmland.

1449
00:47:54,989 --> 00:47:58,019
People who owned that land must have become rich.

1450
00:47:58,020 --> 00:47:59,988
Is that the only thing you think about?

1451
00:47:59,989 --> 00:48:01,935
Seriously, Seok Jin.

1452
00:48:01,989 --> 00:48:03,758
It's great that you have such information.

1453
00:48:03,759 --> 00:48:06,245
That area became a new town.

1454
00:48:06,270 --> 00:48:08,329
If we turn right, we will reach Anyang Stream.

1455
00:48:08,330 --> 00:48:10,939
Cherry blossoms are beautiful there.

1456
00:48:10,940 --> 00:48:12,908
- They must be beautiful. - He is the guide of Anyang.

1457
00:48:12,909 --> 00:48:14,769
Cherry blossoms are beautiful there.

1458
00:48:14,770 --> 00:48:17,039
(Cherry blossoms make a grand sight along Anyang Stream.)

1459
00:48:17,040 --> 00:48:18,309
Cherry blossoms are beautiful there.

1460
00:48:18,310 --> 00:48:19,484
Have you had a date there?

1461
00:48:19,549 --> 00:48:21,048
- Of course, he has. - Yes, I have.

1462
00:48:21,049 --> 00:48:22,425
- When? In high school? - Did you wear a school uniform?

1463
00:48:22,480 --> 00:48:23,694
No, no.

1464
00:48:23,719 --> 00:48:25,988
- It was after I became an adult. - I see.

1465
00:48:25,989 --> 00:48:28,124
With how many people did you take a walk there?

1466
00:48:28,750 --> 00:48:30,189
I took a walk there with one person.

1467
00:48:30,190 --> 00:48:31,265
I see.

1468
00:48:31,290 --> 00:48:32,829
There is Anyang Stream to your right.

1469
00:48:32,830 --> 00:48:34,258
It must be beautiful in the spring.

1470
00:48:34,259 --> 00:48:37,774
Cherry blossoms are amazing here.

1471
00:48:37,860 --> 00:48:39,729
Cherry blossoms are beautiful here.

1472
00:48:39,730 --> 00:48:41,169
- This side used to be farmland? - Yes.

1473
00:48:41,170 --> 00:48:42,374
(He ruins the atmosphere again.)

1474
00:48:43,170 --> 00:48:44,169
(Seok Jin only cares about real estate.)

1475
00:48:44,170 --> 00:48:46,285
He only cares about real estate.

1476
00:48:46,940 --> 00:48:48,709
I only care about love...

1477
00:48:48,710 --> 00:48:50,285
and Seok Jin only cares about real estate.

1478
00:48:50,310 --> 00:48:53,325
There's a Starbucks.

1479
00:48:53,850 --> 00:48:55,718
A Twosome Place too.

1480
00:48:55,719 --> 00:48:56,879
"I should have invested in this piece of land."

1481
00:48:56,880 --> 00:48:59,265
- It's a drive-through. - I know.

1482
00:48:59,350 --> 00:49:02,789
To your left is Anyang Sports Complex.

1483
00:49:02,790 --> 00:49:06,865
We used to have school events at Anyang Sports Complex.

1484
00:49:06,929 --> 00:49:09,104
It seems like you liked your school a lot.

1485
00:49:09,699 --> 00:49:11,374
My school was a paradise.

1486
00:49:11,500 --> 00:49:12,599
I really liked my school.

1487
00:49:12,600 --> 00:49:13,669
(His face lights up when he talks about his school.)

1488
00:49:13,670 --> 00:49:16,138
Sinsung Festival was really famous.

1489
00:49:16,139 --> 00:49:18,099
- I see. - We were like celebrities.

1490
00:49:18,100 --> 00:49:19,539
Did singers come to perform at the festival?

1491
00:49:19,540 --> 00:49:22,254
No, they didn't. But we were like celebrities.

1492
00:49:22,380 --> 00:49:23,809
- Really? - Some students took the stage.

1493
00:49:23,810 --> 00:49:25,408
- Did you take the stage? - Of course, I did.

1494
00:49:25,409 --> 00:49:27,349
- I was a member of D.L. Boys. - D.L. Boys.

1495
00:49:27,350 --> 00:49:29,678
- It was a dance team. - Did you do the b-boying dance?

1496
00:49:29,679 --> 00:49:31,448
When D.L. Boys...

1497
00:49:31,449 --> 00:49:33,088
- danced... - What does D.L. stand for?

1498
00:49:33,089 --> 00:49:35,325
- It has to be about dance. - Dancing Little Boys.

1499
00:49:35,860 --> 00:49:37,459
How cute! Dancing Little Boys.

1500
00:49:37,460 --> 00:49:38,488
Why did you add "Little"?

1501
00:49:38,489 --> 00:49:41,035
The teachers called us...

1502
00:49:41,159 --> 00:49:43,905
Dirty and Lazy Boys.

1503
00:49:44,360 --> 00:49:46,399
- Dirty and lazy. - Dirty and lazy.

1504
00:49:46,400 --> 00:49:48,468
(His memories are scattered across Anyang.)

1505
00:49:48,469 --> 00:49:53,314
(Jong Kook's school days make up the biggest part of the memories.)

1506
00:49:53,639 --> 00:49:55,314
Dancing Little Boys.

1507
00:49:55,839 --> 00:49:57,079
How cute!

1508
00:49:57,080 --> 00:49:58,278
(Kim Jong Kook)

1509
00:49:58,279 --> 00:49:59,754
My school was a paradise.

1510
00:49:59,980 --> 00:50:03,495
I really liked my school. I was proud of my school.

1511
00:50:05,150 --> 00:50:07,225
- Is this the restaurant? - We need to park and eat quickly.

1512
00:50:07,889 --> 00:50:09,834
(They get out before the chasers arrive.)

1513
00:50:10,460 --> 00:50:11,919
Hello.

1514
00:50:11,920 --> 00:50:13,559
- Hello. - Hello.

1515
00:50:13,560 --> 00:50:15,004
Is there a back door?

1516
00:50:15,529 --> 00:50:16,698
Is there a back door?

1517
00:50:16,699 --> 00:50:18,499
There is a back door that is connected to the kitchen.

1518
00:50:18,500 --> 00:50:20,169
If something happens later,

1519
00:50:20,170 --> 00:50:21,874
may we escape through the back door?

1520
00:50:22,270 --> 00:50:23,338
Sure.

1521
00:50:23,339 --> 00:50:24,338
Is it this way?

1522
00:50:24,339 --> 00:50:25,908
What's the mission?

1523
00:50:25,909 --> 00:50:27,368
You can just eat.

1524
00:50:27,369 --> 00:50:29,354
- We can just eat. - Three seolleongtang.

1525
00:50:29,380 --> 00:50:31,638
Since the tables are too close to the entrance,

1526
00:50:31,639 --> 00:50:32,979
someone should keep a lookout.

1527
00:50:32,980 --> 00:50:35,455
We should take turns keeping a lookout.

1528
00:50:35,549 --> 00:50:38,225
- That would be for the best. - I will keep a lookout first.

1529
00:50:38,250 --> 00:50:39,618
Tell me when seolleongtang is served.

1530
00:50:39,619 --> 00:50:41,249
Three seolleongtang, please.

1531
00:50:41,250 --> 00:50:42,664
- Okay. - Three seolleongtang, please.

1532
00:50:43,520 --> 00:50:46,035
(He is very wary.)

1533
00:50:46,159 --> 00:50:48,135
There is no escape route.

1534
00:50:48,759 --> 00:50:50,604
We would like to pay first.

1535
00:50:51,060 --> 00:50:52,745
We might need to run away.

1536
00:50:53,130 --> 00:50:55,104
Isn't that a van? There is a van.

1537
00:50:55,900 --> 00:50:58,414
(He looks to all directions.)

1538
00:50:59,369 --> 00:51:00,939
- Jae Seok, run away! - Catch him!

1539
00:51:00,940 --> 00:51:02,169
(Jae Seok, run away!)

1540
00:51:02,170 --> 00:51:03,479
(Seok Jin suddenly appears.)

1541
00:51:03,480 --> 00:51:04,579
- Run away! - Catch him!

1542
00:51:04,580 --> 00:51:05,908
Catch him!

1543
00:51:05,909 --> 00:51:08,178
(It's a disaster! Let's run away!)

1544
00:51:08,179 --> 00:51:09,825
- Run away! - This is the restroom.

1545
00:51:10,080 --> 00:51:12,118
Hurry up. Hurry up.

1546
00:51:12,119 --> 00:51:13,888
- There they are. - Run away!

1547
00:51:13,889 --> 00:51:17,237
(The chasers approach the entrance of the restaurant.)

1548
00:51:17,380 --> 00:51:19,418
Hurry up. Hurry up.

1549
00:51:19,419 --> 00:51:21,188
- There they are. - Run away!

1550
00:51:21,189 --> 00:51:23,688
(The chasers approach the entrance of the restaurant.)

1551
00:51:23,689 --> 00:51:25,019
Where is the back door?

1552
00:51:25,020 --> 00:51:26,535
- Excuse me. - Where is the exit?

1553
00:51:27,189 --> 00:51:28,659
(The chasers who were approaching the restaurant...)

1554
00:51:28,660 --> 00:51:31,028
(begin to go after Se Chan.)

1555
00:51:31,029 --> 00:51:32,305
Run away!

1556
00:51:32,650 --> 00:51:34,125
- Run away! - Catch him!

1557
00:51:35,050 --> 00:51:36,524
- Catch him! - Run away!

1558
00:51:37,090 --> 00:51:38,589
- Where is the back door? - Excuse me.

1559
00:51:38,590 --> 00:51:39,964
Where is the exit? I am sorry.

1560
00:51:39,989 --> 00:51:41,459
The floor is slippery.

1561
00:51:41,460 --> 00:51:42,794
(They try to escape through the back door.)

1562
00:51:44,360 --> 00:51:45,705
Run away!

1563
00:51:45,730 --> 00:51:47,298
We need to catch him.

1564
00:51:47,299 --> 00:51:48,834
We need to catch Se Chan.

1565
00:51:50,245 --> 00:51:51,443
Run away!

1566
00:51:51,444 --> 00:51:53,050
(They run through the staff members' cars.)

1567
00:51:53,814 --> 00:51:56,014
(Haha is right behind Se Chan.)

1568
00:51:56,015 --> 00:51:57,389
Run away!

1569
00:51:57,745 --> 00:51:59,144
(In the end,)

1570
00:51:59,145 --> 00:52:02,059
(he gets his name tag ripped off.)

1571
00:52:03,455 --> 00:52:05,360
- We caught him! - Haha caught him.

1572
00:52:05,424 --> 00:52:07,354
- Haha caught him. - Yang Se Chan.

1573
00:52:07,355 --> 00:52:08,653
- Did we catch him? - Yes.

1574
00:52:08,654 --> 00:52:09,793
Where are the others?

1575
00:52:09,794 --> 00:52:10,970
Come here.

1576
00:52:12,294 --> 00:52:14,633
(Jae Seok and Kwang Soo escape through the back door.)

1577
00:52:14,634 --> 00:52:16,463
Jong Kook is over there. Jong Kook is over there.

1578
00:52:16,464 --> 00:52:18,003
- Hurry up and come here. - He is over there.

1579
00:52:18,004 --> 00:52:19,479
(They are less than 50m apart!)

1580
00:52:19,734 --> 00:52:20,974
Where is Jong Kook?

1581
00:52:20,975 --> 00:52:22,534
Come here.

1582
00:52:22,535 --> 00:52:24,474
Hide over here. What are we going to do?

1583
00:52:24,475 --> 00:52:26,150
Se Chan is out.

1584
00:52:26,174 --> 00:52:27,613
What is going on?

1585
00:52:27,614 --> 00:52:29,043
- As soon as we entered... - What is this?

1586
00:52:29,044 --> 00:52:30,320
Is this poop?

1587
00:52:32,415 --> 00:52:33,860
Hide, hide.

1588
00:52:35,415 --> 00:52:36,559
This is driving me crazy.

1589
00:52:36,924 --> 00:52:38,184
- Where are the other two? - Did you eat?

1590
00:52:38,185 --> 00:52:39,700
- What? - Did you eat?

1591
00:52:39,884 --> 00:52:41,224
- Did you eat lunch? - Where are the others?

1592
00:52:41,225 --> 00:52:42,570
- Let's go. - Where are the others?

1593
00:52:42,654 --> 00:52:44,994
- They must be inside the van! - They could be inside.

1594
00:52:44,995 --> 00:52:46,769
They could be inside the restaurant.

1595
00:52:46,995 --> 00:52:49,340
(They run towards the restaurant again.)

1596
00:52:52,134 --> 00:52:55,650
(I think I hear people running.)

1597
00:52:56,274 --> 00:53:00,990
(Jae Seok and Kwang Soo are behind the building to their right.)

1598
00:53:02,114 --> 00:53:05,419
(However, a truck blocks their view.)

1599
00:53:05,645 --> 00:53:07,030
Roll down the window.

1600
00:53:07,314 --> 00:53:08,454
They aren't inside, are they?

1601
00:53:08,455 --> 00:53:09,990
(They search the staff members' vehicles.)

1602
00:53:10,785 --> 00:53:12,184
Let's go up the building.

1603
00:53:12,185 --> 00:53:13,400
(Now is our chance!)

1604
00:53:13,895 --> 00:53:16,224
(They try to enter the building while they search the vehicles.)

1605
00:53:16,225 --> 00:53:17,970
It's over here.

1606
00:53:18,265 --> 00:53:20,939
(Are they in here?)

1607
00:53:22,364 --> 00:53:24,503
(They safely enter the building!)

1608
00:53:24,504 --> 00:53:26,039
There she is. So Min is over there.

1609
00:53:27,605 --> 00:53:29,173
There she is.

1610
00:53:29,174 --> 00:53:30,843
- I see Se Chan. - Jong Kook.

1611
00:53:30,844 --> 00:53:32,304
Thank goodness we didn't go outside.

1612
00:53:32,305 --> 00:53:33,843
Then we would have gotten caught.

1613
00:53:33,844 --> 00:53:35,419
(They barely manage to hide.)

1614
00:53:36,044 --> 00:53:37,914
We can't go to the places...

1615
00:53:37,915 --> 00:53:39,184
we talked about so far.

1616
00:53:39,185 --> 00:53:40,959
Se Chan will tell them everything.

1617
00:53:41,685 --> 00:53:44,124
(He can't help but laugh.)

1618
00:53:44,125 --> 00:53:45,700
For goodness' sake.

1619
00:53:45,785 --> 00:53:48,329
I can't believe the biggest tattletale got caught.

1620
00:53:49,194 --> 00:53:50,570
There are enemies everywhere.

1621
00:53:50,665 --> 00:53:52,400
How did they come right away?

1622
00:53:53,395 --> 00:53:55,133
They came here instead of the high school.

1623
00:53:55,134 --> 00:53:56,209
(Their feint didn't work.)

1624
00:53:56,564 --> 00:53:58,003
(What should we do?)

1625
00:53:58,004 --> 00:53:59,479
Earlier,

1626
00:53:59,504 --> 00:54:01,479
you hid only your head in the alley.

1627
00:54:02,234 --> 00:54:04,474
You have no talent in running.

1628
00:54:04,475 --> 00:54:06,074
Speak for yourself.

1629
00:54:06,075 --> 00:54:08,550
"Gosh, is this poop?"

1630
00:54:09,075 --> 00:54:11,113
What was that?

1631
00:54:11,114 --> 00:54:12,713
You saw how confident I was, right?

1632
00:54:12,714 --> 00:54:14,653
- Confident? - You saw, right?

1633
00:54:14,654 --> 00:54:17,383
Did you think they wouldn't see you if you don't see them?

1634
00:54:17,384 --> 00:54:18,459
Be quiet.

1635
00:54:18,654 --> 00:54:19,954
(He ignores Kwang Soo.)

1636
00:54:19,955 --> 00:54:21,900
Let's wait for them to leave...

1637
00:54:22,395 --> 00:54:23,523
and go back into the restaurant.

1638
00:54:23,524 --> 00:54:24,669
(Will they be able to succeed the mission?)

1639
00:54:25,464 --> 00:54:27,534
They escaped through the back door.

1640
00:54:27,535 --> 00:54:29,269
- I knew it. - They ordered seolleongtang.

1641
00:54:29,335 --> 00:54:31,063
They ordered seolleongtang, but couldn't eat it.

1642
00:54:31,064 --> 00:54:32,133
Really?

1643
00:54:32,134 --> 00:54:34,403
We should have come straight to the restaurant...

1644
00:54:34,404 --> 00:54:35,704
instead of chasing after Se Chan.

1645
00:54:35,705 --> 00:54:37,374
They didn't complete the mission.

1646
00:54:37,375 --> 00:54:38,903
- No, they didn't. - No.

1647
00:54:38,904 --> 00:54:41,450
Then we should go to Sinsung High School next.

1648
00:54:41,875 --> 00:54:43,273
You must have information.

1649
00:54:43,274 --> 00:54:45,983
- What information? - You aren't on their side anymore.

1650
00:54:45,984 --> 00:54:47,213
You are on our side.

1651
00:54:47,214 --> 00:54:49,054
You can't get their money anymore. We will share our money.

1652
00:54:49,055 --> 00:54:50,054
Really?

1653
00:54:50,055 --> 00:54:51,624
Oh, you will get goosebumps when you hear this.

1654
00:54:51,625 --> 00:54:53,483
There is a spy among you.

1655
00:54:53,484 --> 00:54:55,700
(He makes a shocking confession.)

1656
00:54:56,355 --> 00:54:58,264
Didn't you know? There is a spy among you.

1657
00:54:58,265 --> 00:55:00,093
Look at her eyes! Look at her eyes!

1658
00:55:00,094 --> 00:55:01,994
When he mentioned the spy...

1659
00:55:01,995 --> 00:55:03,293
What is going on?

1660
00:55:03,294 --> 00:55:04,579
When he mentioned the spy, she went...

1661
00:55:05,234 --> 00:55:06,463
There is a spy among you.

1662
00:55:06,464 --> 00:55:08,304
Gosh, So Min.

1663
00:55:08,305 --> 00:55:10,704
I will remember everything...

1664
00:55:10,705 --> 00:55:12,343
and deduct money later.

1665
00:55:12,344 --> 00:55:14,443
- You will give me points, right? - Of course.

1666
00:55:14,444 --> 00:55:15,943
I will deduct from your share later.

1667
00:55:15,944 --> 00:55:18,914
Call the runaways...

1668
00:55:18,915 --> 00:55:20,184
on the speakerphone.

1669
00:55:20,185 --> 00:55:22,113
- I will give it a try. - This team is much better.

1670
00:55:22,114 --> 00:55:24,054
In any case,

1671
00:55:24,055 --> 00:55:26,184
I can take money from the spy...

1672
00:55:26,185 --> 00:55:28,093
- and give it to you. - Actually, there are two spies.

1673
00:55:28,094 --> 00:55:30,394
I will reveal one of them while we finish eating here.

1674
00:55:30,395 --> 00:55:31,724
- There are two spies? - What was that?

1675
00:55:31,725 --> 00:55:33,369
(Spitting out)

1676
00:55:34,535 --> 00:55:36,534
What's wrong, So Min? Eat slowly.

1677
00:55:36,535 --> 00:55:37,733
It's not like that.

1678
00:55:37,734 --> 00:55:39,834
- Don't be flustered. - I am not a spy.

1679
00:55:39,835 --> 00:55:40,834
He didn't say anything.

1680
00:55:40,835 --> 00:55:42,880
He keeps looking at me.

1681
00:55:42,935 --> 00:55:44,003
Kwang Soo.

1682
00:55:44,004 --> 00:55:45,304
- Hello? - Yes.

1683
00:55:45,305 --> 00:55:47,744
- Where are you? - I'm elsewhere.

1684
00:55:47,745 --> 00:55:49,113
Kwang Soo,

1685
00:55:49,114 --> 00:55:51,514
I'm stuck here,

1686
00:55:51,515 --> 00:55:53,014
but you sound very calm.

1687
00:55:53,015 --> 00:55:55,030
That was expected.

1688
00:55:55,285 --> 00:55:56,954
Follow through with our plan, okay?

1689
00:55:56,955 --> 00:55:58,700
(He butts in.)

1690
00:55:59,384 --> 00:56:00,394
What did you say, Jae Seok?

1691
00:56:00,395 --> 00:56:02,523
- Follow through with our plan. - Right now...

1692
00:56:02,524 --> 00:56:03,624
Don't say anything else.

1693
00:56:03,625 --> 00:56:05,840
Don't say anything else. Follow our plan. That's it.

1694
00:56:06,064 --> 00:56:08,593
I'm in jail. He hung up.

1695
00:56:08,594 --> 00:56:09,934
(He hung up.)

1696
00:56:09,935 --> 00:56:11,903
- What's your plan? - Tell us.

1697
00:56:11,904 --> 00:56:13,604
What's your plan?

1698
00:56:13,605 --> 00:56:16,950
Sorry. Let's turn the cameras off. In 1, 2, 3.

1699
00:56:17,044 --> 00:56:19,144
Let's turn them back on. Turn them back on.

1700
00:56:19,145 --> 00:56:20,943
- Hold on. Turn them back on. - I'm going to block the cameras.

1701
00:56:20,944 --> 00:56:22,773
Turn them back on.

1702
00:56:22,774 --> 00:56:25,260
I'll close the door to the secret room.

1703
00:56:25,915 --> 00:56:27,153
(While Se Chan's life is threatened for what Jae Seok said...)

1704
00:56:27,154 --> 00:56:28,713
They'll suspect him.

1705
00:56:28,714 --> 00:56:31,059
I think...

1706
00:56:31,325 --> 00:56:33,930
you're the best in the world with things like this.

1707
00:56:34,225 --> 00:56:36,729
I got eliminated several times because of him.

1708
00:56:37,225 --> 00:56:38,894
You cause them to fight among themselves.

1709
00:56:38,895 --> 00:56:39,923
(That's an idiom.)

1710
00:56:39,924 --> 00:56:41,834
Look one way and row another. You know, right?

1711
00:56:41,835 --> 00:56:43,563
This is a season of high sky and plump horses.

1712
00:56:43,564 --> 00:56:45,664
(He replies with another idiom.)

1713
00:56:45,665 --> 00:56:47,133
(That's the only idiom he knows.)

1714
00:56:47,134 --> 00:56:49,610
When will you stop saying that one?

1715
00:56:49,805 --> 00:56:51,003
I won't.

1716
00:56:51,004 --> 00:56:52,003
(I'll use it next fall as well.)

1717
00:56:52,004 --> 00:56:54,914
We have to finish the seolleongtang and forget about one place.

1718
00:56:54,915 --> 00:56:58,220
It's too difficult to do two.

1719
00:56:59,015 --> 00:57:01,014
There's no mission easier than this.

1720
00:57:01,015 --> 00:57:02,660
- Right? - Right.

1721
00:57:02,685 --> 00:57:04,224
There's nothing easier than this.

1722
00:57:04,225 --> 00:57:08,293
Should we get seolleongtang delivered here?

1723
00:57:08,294 --> 00:57:09,324
That works.

1724
00:57:09,325 --> 00:57:10,669
- Call. - Should I call?

1725
00:57:10,694 --> 00:57:13,423
We can take it to go from the back.

1726
00:57:13,424 --> 00:57:15,309
- We can go secretly. - Right.

1727
00:57:15,464 --> 00:57:17,034
We don't need any side dishes. Just radish kimchi.

1728
00:57:17,035 --> 00:57:19,003
- Hello. - Can we...

1729
00:57:19,004 --> 00:57:21,479
- order to go? - Yes.

1730
00:57:22,305 --> 00:57:25,673
Sorry, but if you can pack them in plastic bowls,

1731
00:57:25,674 --> 00:57:28,514
we can pick them up in the back by the kitchen.

1732
00:57:28,515 --> 00:57:29,874
We'll eat and return them to you.

1733
00:57:29,875 --> 00:57:31,584
- Through the back? - Yes, through the back.

1734
00:57:31,585 --> 00:57:32,883
- Please call me. - All right.

1735
00:57:32,884 --> 00:57:33,914
- Excuse me. - Thank you.

1736
00:57:33,915 --> 00:57:35,914
Can you give us a lot of soup in the radish kimchi?

1737
00:57:35,915 --> 00:57:37,900
Can we get one radish kimchi?

1738
00:57:38,024 --> 00:57:39,324
Okay.

1739
00:57:39,325 --> 00:57:41,023
(They're done ordering seolleongtang to go.)

1740
00:57:41,024 --> 00:57:42,530
This is driving me insane.

1741
00:57:43,055 --> 00:57:44,700
Plan one.

1742
00:57:44,895 --> 00:57:48,340
What's the plan? There's none. But where were we going to go?

1743
00:57:48,794 --> 00:57:49,939
His house.

1744
00:57:50,404 --> 00:57:52,503
- See? - We were going to go there.

1745
00:57:52,504 --> 00:57:55,280
And then his high school.

1746
00:57:55,375 --> 00:57:56,704
We only talked about those two.

1747
00:57:56,705 --> 00:57:58,650
And Anyang First Street.

1748
00:57:58,674 --> 00:58:01,313
We were going to go around Anyang First Street...

1749
00:58:01,314 --> 00:58:03,043
and ask people whether Jong Kook came or not.

1750
00:58:03,044 --> 00:58:05,644
We were going to start the mission wherever he had been.

1751
00:58:05,645 --> 00:58:08,713
So what he's saying is that they didn't pick a certain place.

1752
00:58:08,714 --> 00:58:10,624
They were going to decide when they got there.

1753
00:58:10,625 --> 00:58:11,624
However,

1754
00:58:11,625 --> 00:58:14,293
these places were related to Jong Kook.

1755
00:58:14,294 --> 00:58:15,499
(They have no idea that the runaways ordered seolleongtang.)

1756
00:58:16,154 --> 00:58:18,894
Here. Be quiet.

1757
00:58:18,895 --> 00:58:20,124
Hello?

1758
00:58:20,125 --> 00:58:21,563
Yes, hello?

1759
00:58:21,564 --> 00:58:24,934
It's ready. Do you want to come to the back door?

1760
00:58:24,935 --> 00:58:26,104
Yes, thank you.

1761
00:58:26,105 --> 00:58:28,503
Can you put the bowls outside the back door...

1762
00:58:28,504 --> 00:58:32,503
like they're jjajangmyeon? We'll eat right there.

1763
00:58:32,504 --> 00:58:36,374
- The members aren't there, right? - They're not. I'll put it outside.

1764
00:58:36,375 --> 00:58:38,713
- We have to bring it here. - I'll do that right now.

1765
00:58:38,714 --> 00:58:40,483
- Thank you. - Thank you.

1766
00:58:40,484 --> 00:58:41,653
No problem.

1767
00:58:41,654 --> 00:58:43,383
This is driving me insane.

1768
00:58:43,384 --> 00:58:44,653
(The 1st hurdle is picking up the seolleongtang.)

1769
00:58:44,654 --> 00:58:46,729
Hey.

1770
00:58:47,024 --> 00:58:48,400
Let's ask him.

1771
00:58:49,024 --> 00:58:51,023
- Can you pick it up for us? - Can you pick it up?

1772
00:58:51,024 --> 00:58:52,300
We're sorry.

1773
00:58:52,495 --> 00:58:53,593
I'll take the camera.

1774
00:58:53,594 --> 00:58:55,494
Can you pick it up for us?

1775
00:58:55,495 --> 00:58:56,693
We're sorry.

1776
00:58:56,694 --> 00:58:58,764
- I can do it. - Okay, go.

1777
00:58:58,765 --> 00:59:00,510
Hurry up. Sorry.

1778
00:59:01,805 --> 00:59:04,304
(The cameraman leaves to pick up the seolleongtang.)

1779
00:59:04,305 --> 00:59:07,180
If they follow Yoon Sang back, we're dead.

1780
00:59:08,674 --> 00:59:10,990
(They're very anxious.)

1781
00:59:11,714 --> 00:59:14,189
(He makes it to the back door hidden from the members.)

1782
00:59:14,754 --> 00:59:17,014
(He contacts the employee stealthily...)

1783
00:59:17,015 --> 00:59:19,099
(and picks up the seolleongtang.)

1784
00:59:20,125 --> 00:59:22,923
(He has to deliver it safely.)

1785
00:59:22,924 --> 00:59:24,200
We're in trouble.

1786
00:59:24,665 --> 00:59:25,664
- Yoon Sang. - He's back.

1787
00:59:25,665 --> 00:59:26,894
Thank you.

1788
00:59:26,895 --> 00:59:28,334
(He delivered it safely!)

1789
00:59:28,335 --> 00:59:30,340
Yoon Sang, are they around?

1790
00:59:30,805 --> 00:59:31,804
- They're not. - You didn't see them?

1791
00:59:31,805 --> 00:59:32,979
Are they not inside?

1792
00:59:33,004 --> 00:59:34,704
- I didn't look inside. - Okay.

1793
00:59:34,705 --> 00:59:36,474
I went to the backdoor.

1794
00:59:36,475 --> 00:59:38,079
He's a coward as well.

1795
00:59:39,205 --> 00:59:41,090
He probably had no courage to look inside.

1796
00:59:41,145 --> 00:59:43,490
(Kwang Soo and his cameraman are alike.)

1797
00:59:44,015 --> 00:59:46,220
(They start eating.)

1798
00:59:46,884 --> 00:59:49,813
It's been 30 minutes since you completed a mission.

1799
00:59:49,814 --> 00:59:52,324
Here's the Chance Card Mission.

1800
00:59:52,325 --> 00:59:53,559
- Okay. - Okay.

1801
00:59:53,685 --> 00:59:57,023
This Chance Card Mission is called, Dice Up and Down.

1802
00:59:57,024 --> 00:59:59,664
All five of you will toss a die.

1803
00:59:59,665 --> 01:00:02,809
You need to guess whether the total will be greater or lesser than 17.

1804
01:00:03,794 --> 01:00:05,903
- Am I not in? - No.

1805
01:00:05,904 --> 01:00:07,380
(He's firm.)

1806
01:00:07,904 --> 01:00:09,034
He doesn't get to play?

1807
01:00:09,035 --> 01:00:10,979
- No. - Five of us?

1808
01:00:11,044 --> 01:00:12,043
It's less then.

1809
01:00:12,044 --> 01:00:14,273
Will you pick greater or lesser than 17?

1810
01:00:14,274 --> 01:00:15,914
- Lesser. - Should we go with that?

1811
01:00:15,915 --> 01:00:17,514
- Lesser is better. - I agree.

1812
01:00:17,515 --> 01:00:18,813
Isn't there a better chance?

1813
01:00:18,814 --> 01:00:19,843
5 times 3 is 15.

1814
01:00:19,844 --> 01:00:22,383
I think the chances are similar. That's why they're suggesting it.

1815
01:00:22,384 --> 01:00:23,483
- Lesser. - Lesser.

1816
01:00:23,484 --> 01:00:24,883
- Should we go with that? - Lesser than 17.

1817
01:00:24,884 --> 01:00:26,459
Ji Hyo, get one.

1818
01:00:26,725 --> 01:00:28,124
She always gets what she wants.

1819
01:00:28,125 --> 01:00:29,394
Here's a die. Go one at a time.

1820
01:00:29,395 --> 01:00:31,769
- Who's going first? Should I go? - Try it.

1821
01:00:31,964 --> 01:00:33,324
Lesser than 17.

1822
01:00:33,325 --> 01:00:35,563
- It's less. - Yes, it's less.

1823
01:00:35,564 --> 01:00:37,639
This is awkward to throw.

1824
01:00:38,364 --> 01:00:39,363
This is...

1825
01:00:39,364 --> 01:00:40,979
(He has to get a small number for a better chance to succeed.)

1826
01:00:42,575 --> 01:00:43,673
- 4. - 4.

1827
01:00:43,674 --> 01:00:45,144
- Okay. - 4.

1828
01:00:45,145 --> 01:00:46,644
(Jong Kook tosses 4.)

1829
01:00:46,645 --> 01:00:48,450
- Ji Hyo, go last. - You can't...

1830
01:00:48,515 --> 01:00:50,684
toss it all you want, so it's weird.

1831
01:00:50,685 --> 01:00:51,820
(Haha is next.)

1832
01:00:52,214 --> 01:00:53,244
That's true.

1833
01:00:53,245 --> 01:00:55,414
(Haha)

1834
01:00:55,415 --> 01:00:56,584
Four.

1835
01:00:56,585 --> 01:00:57,999
(Haha tosses 4.)

1836
01:00:58,085 --> 01:01:00,383
- 4 times 5 is 20. - Haha got 4.

1837
01:01:00,384 --> 01:01:02,394
This isn't good. You have to get 2 or 3.

1838
01:01:02,395 --> 01:01:03,800
You can do it.

1839
01:01:03,855 --> 01:01:05,039
You have to toss it lightly.

1840
01:01:06,225 --> 01:01:07,593
- 4. - 4.

1841
01:01:07,594 --> 01:01:09,293
(Seok Jin tosses 4.)

1842
01:01:09,294 --> 01:01:10,633
Why is it all 4? Is it the deadly 4?

1843
01:01:10,634 --> 01:01:11,903
- How's this possible? - Go.

1844
01:01:11,904 --> 01:01:13,264
- 4 times 3 is 12. - It's 12.

1845
01:01:13,265 --> 01:01:14,709
- We're at 12. - It's 12.

1846
01:01:15,305 --> 01:01:19,403
(So Min and Ji Hyo are left. Their sum has to be less than 5.)

1847
01:01:19,404 --> 01:01:20,403
Yes.

1848
01:01:20,404 --> 01:01:22,043
(So Min gets 1.)

1849
01:01:22,044 --> 01:01:23,414
Jong Kook, my level of contribution.

1850
01:01:23,415 --> 01:01:25,144
- 13. - My level of contribution.

1851
01:01:25,145 --> 01:01:26,843
- Less than 4. - You have to get less than 4.

1852
01:01:26,844 --> 01:01:28,113
Four is okay too.

1853
01:01:28,114 --> 01:01:29,630
4 is okay too. It's less than 17.

1854
01:01:30,285 --> 01:01:35,300
(Will she get less than 4 and win the mission?)

1855
01:01:35,354 --> 01:01:39,354

1856
01:01:39,464 --> 01:01:41,934
(They win with a total of 16.)

1857
01:01:41,935 --> 01:01:43,494
- We got it, right? - Ji Hyo got three,

1858
01:01:43,495 --> 01:01:44,664
so the total is 16. You win.

1859
01:01:44,665 --> 01:01:45,764
Okay.

1860
01:01:45,765 --> 01:01:47,474
- Ji Hyo. - You did it.

1861
01:01:47,475 --> 01:01:49,809
- Pick one. - Go ahead, Se Chan.

1862
01:01:50,234 --> 01:01:51,843
I have a good feeling.

1863
01:01:51,844 --> 01:01:52,843
(What Chance Card did he pick?)

1864
01:01:52,844 --> 01:01:53,950
Okay.

1865
01:01:54,774 --> 01:01:56,113
This is good.

1866
01:01:56,114 --> 01:01:58,289
(Photo of Their Current Whereabouts)

1867
01:01:58,714 --> 01:02:00,284
Wasn't that good?

1868
01:02:00,285 --> 01:02:02,054
Will it be a full frame shot?

1869
01:02:02,055 --> 01:02:04,584
It has to be a wide shot. It can't be a small one.

1870
01:02:04,585 --> 01:02:06,224
(They don't know that the chasers won.)

1871
01:02:06,225 --> 01:02:08,124
- This is really good. - I'm going to miss this.

1872
01:02:08,125 --> 01:02:09,724
(They're drinking the soup.)

1873
01:02:09,725 --> 01:02:11,164
(They cleared the bowl.)

1874
01:02:11,165 --> 01:02:12,300
That was really good.

1875
01:02:12,524 --> 01:02:15,334
We have to clean up.

1876
01:02:15,335 --> 01:02:18,903
Here's a commemorative photo. In 1, 2, 3.

1877
01:02:18,904 --> 01:02:20,403
(Clicking)

1878
01:02:20,404 --> 01:02:22,610
What? Why did you take a picture of us?

1879
01:02:22,904 --> 01:02:26,019
(Why did he take a picture?)

1880
01:02:26,504 --> 01:02:28,313
(They don't know why their picture was taken.)

1881
01:02:28,314 --> 01:02:29,389
Here it is.

1882
01:02:29,575 --> 01:02:31,144
- Is this where they are now? - Where is this?

1883
01:02:31,145 --> 01:02:32,644
- What is this? - Where are they? You look.

1884
01:02:32,645 --> 01:02:34,189
No way.

1885
01:02:34,314 --> 01:02:36,490
- Where is this? What did they do? - They ordered food.

1886
01:02:36,515 --> 01:02:37,523
Is that ramyeon?

1887
01:02:37,524 --> 01:02:38,923
See where they got it from.

1888
01:02:38,924 --> 01:02:40,660
- It's stew. - It wasn't delivered.

1889
01:02:41,024 --> 01:02:44,224
- They had it to go. - They ordered from here.

1890
01:02:44,225 --> 01:02:46,023
Are they in the back?

1891
01:02:46,024 --> 01:02:47,494
The beacon does not shine on its own base.

1892
01:02:47,495 --> 01:02:49,034
- That... Hey. - They were going to do the mission.

1893
01:02:49,035 --> 01:02:52,003
I think so. They win if they eat this food.

1894
01:02:52,004 --> 01:02:53,133
- Right. - That's it.

1895
01:02:53,134 --> 01:02:55,834
I think it's the building behind us.

1896
01:02:55,835 --> 01:02:58,380
We can go and ask. Let's head out.

1897
01:02:58,745 --> 01:03:00,403
This is nearby.

1898
01:03:00,404 --> 01:03:04,689
Excuse me. Are these your containers? These?

1899
01:03:05,015 --> 01:03:07,284
- This is from here, right? - They had it delivered, right?

1900
01:03:07,285 --> 01:03:08,483
- It wasn't delivery. - Delivery.

1901
01:03:08,484 --> 01:03:10,414
- They ordered it to go. - We were right.

1902
01:03:10,415 --> 01:03:11,883
When was it?

1903
01:03:11,884 --> 01:03:13,729
They ordered 15 minutes ago.

1904
01:03:13,955 --> 01:03:15,753
What? We were here.

1905
01:03:15,754 --> 01:03:17,023
We were here.

1906
01:03:17,024 --> 01:03:19,423
- We were eating. - Did they order...

1907
01:03:19,424 --> 01:03:20,423
when we were inside?

1908
01:03:20,424 --> 01:03:21,434
They called to order.

1909
01:03:21,435 --> 01:03:23,193
- Did they call and then pick it up? - Yes.

1910
01:03:23,194 --> 01:03:24,304
They picked it up?

1911
01:03:24,305 --> 01:03:26,280
While we were inside?

1912
01:03:26,805 --> 01:03:28,773
- They're nearby. - My gosh.

1913
01:03:28,774 --> 01:03:30,003
This building.

1914
01:03:30,004 --> 01:03:31,503
This building. Jong Kook, this building.

1915
01:03:31,504 --> 01:03:33,650
Tell everybody to come.

1916
01:03:33,844 --> 01:03:36,289
Hold on. We're close.

1917
01:03:36,375 --> 01:03:39,389
Were the bowls empty?

1918
01:03:39,884 --> 01:03:41,213
- Were they empty? - They already ate.

1919
01:03:41,214 --> 01:03:42,590
They already ate? They were done?

1920
01:03:42,714 --> 01:03:43,753
Hey.

1921
01:03:43,754 --> 01:03:46,653
(They cleaned up, and they're going to go down.)

1922
01:03:46,654 --> 01:03:48,224
If we go now, we might get caught.

1923
01:03:48,225 --> 01:03:50,200
This is insane. I don't know what's going to happen.

1924
01:03:50,864 --> 01:03:53,840
There's a good chance they didn't move from here.

1925
01:03:54,335 --> 01:03:55,994
(Where did they hide?)

1926
01:03:55,995 --> 01:03:58,304
What? It's the same floor!

1927
01:03:58,305 --> 01:04:01,010
(What? It's the same floor!)

1928
01:04:01,605 --> 01:04:04,304
(Did So Min find the right building?)

1929
01:04:04,305 --> 01:04:06,019
Isn't this the same floor?

1930
01:04:06,875 --> 01:04:09,490
(It looks similar, but it's a different building.)

1931
01:04:09,814 --> 01:04:11,383
It's here!

1932
01:04:11,384 --> 01:04:12,644
(The chasers are certain this is the right building.)

1933
01:04:12,645 --> 01:04:13,990
Hey, block the entrance.

1934
01:04:14,015 --> 01:04:16,030
This is unbelievable.

1935
01:04:16,654 --> 01:04:20,599
(The runaways try to escape from the building across.)

1936
01:04:22,024 --> 01:04:26,300
(While the chasers go up to look...)

1937
01:04:27,935 --> 01:04:30,880
(He sees the chasers in front of the building.)

1938
01:04:31,605 --> 01:04:35,579
(They go inside without noticing Jae Seok.)

1939
01:04:35,805 --> 01:04:37,010
This is the place?

1940
01:04:37,904 --> 01:04:39,003
This is driving me nuts.

1941
01:04:39,004 --> 01:04:40,990
(He sees the chasers go inside and runs in the opposite direction.)

1942
01:04:41,314 --> 01:04:42,943
Hold on. Isn't it the basement?

1943
01:04:42,944 --> 01:04:44,660
(They have no idea the runaways are outside.)

1944
01:04:45,185 --> 01:04:48,360
(Kwang Soo runs away in the opposite direction as well.)

1945
01:04:49,585 --> 01:04:50,999
They're so clever.

1946
01:04:51,625 --> 01:04:52,760
Jae Seok.

1947
01:04:53,154 --> 01:04:54,793
Kwang Soo!

1948
01:04:54,794 --> 01:04:56,023
(When they exit the building,)

1949
01:04:56,024 --> 01:04:57,423
(Jae Seok gets in the car.)

1950
01:04:57,424 --> 01:04:59,169
They're nearby.

1951
01:04:59,864 --> 01:05:02,669
(Kwang Soo gets in as well.)

1952
01:05:03,564 --> 01:05:04,780
Isn't this it?

1953
01:05:06,205 --> 01:05:08,304
(They finally find the right building.)

1954
01:05:08,305 --> 01:05:09,633
Jae Seok is here.

1955
01:05:09,634 --> 01:05:11,749
- They left. - They left.

1956
01:05:12,344 --> 01:05:13,374
They left.

1957
01:05:13,375 --> 01:05:17,119
(They missed the runaways by a second.)

1958
01:05:18,085 --> 01:05:20,559
We're finally going to Anyang First Street.

1959
01:05:21,114 --> 01:05:22,713
We're so close getting the 3,000 dollars.

1960
01:05:22,714 --> 01:05:25,684
- We just have to eat pork cutlet. - We just have to eat it.

1961
01:05:25,685 --> 01:05:26,760
(We just have to eat pork cutlet.)

1962
01:05:27,024 --> 01:05:28,430
Where should we go next?

1963
01:05:29,294 --> 01:05:31,869
(The runaways are contemplating their next destination.)

1964
01:05:31,895 --> 01:05:35,970
He lived 40 years in Anyang and barely went anywhere.

1965
01:05:36,134 --> 01:05:38,563
He has a problem.

1966
01:05:38,564 --> 01:05:39,934
(It's difficult to find Jong Kook's favorite spots.)

1967
01:05:39,935 --> 01:05:41,604
(He looks up "Anyang" and "Jong Kook".)

1968
01:05:41,605 --> 01:05:42,780
Did you find anything?

1969
01:05:44,375 --> 01:05:48,150
(They find the pork cutlet diner Jong Kook approves of.)

1970
01:05:48,975 --> 01:05:53,014
(That's how they headed to Anyang First Street.)

1971
01:05:53,015 --> 01:05:55,789
- Let's rely on our friendship. - Let's do that.

1972
01:05:55,955 --> 01:05:57,660
- It's about time we do that. - Jae Seok.

1973
01:05:58,085 --> 01:05:59,860
- Let's divide the money in half. - Okay.

1974
01:06:00,725 --> 01:06:03,869
I feel bad for Se Chan, but he is with the chasers now.

1975
01:06:04,694 --> 01:06:06,693
It was Se Chan's fate.

1976
01:06:06,694 --> 01:06:08,209
(They cut ties with Se Chan.)

1977
01:06:09,564 --> 01:06:11,439
(What's this!)

1978
01:06:11,835 --> 01:06:13,010
It's Seok Jin.

1979
01:06:13,734 --> 01:06:15,474
- Answer it. - Should I answer it?

1980
01:06:15,475 --> 01:06:16,633
(It's a call from Seok Jin.)

1981
01:06:16,634 --> 01:06:18,273
- Hello. - Jae Seok.

1982
01:06:18,274 --> 01:06:19,403
Hey.

1983
01:06:19,404 --> 01:06:20,780
There are too many people on this team.

1984
01:06:22,015 --> 01:06:23,650
I am inclined to join your team.

1985
01:06:23,714 --> 01:06:25,744
What do you think? Do you need my help?

1986
01:06:25,745 --> 01:06:28,584
(What do you think? Do you need my help?)

1987
01:06:28,585 --> 01:06:29,829
Are you really alone?

1988
01:06:29,984 --> 01:06:31,554
I am really alone.

1989
01:06:31,555 --> 01:06:33,630
- Let's have a video call. - Let's have a video call.

1990
01:06:34,125 --> 01:06:35,269
Where are you?

1991
01:06:35,694 --> 01:06:36,930
Where are you? Switch over to a video call.

1992
01:06:37,094 --> 01:06:38,269
Do you see me?

1993
01:06:39,464 --> 01:06:40,669
I don't see you.

1994
01:06:41,165 --> 01:06:42,470
How do I do this?

1995
01:06:42,935 --> 01:06:44,434
Press the button for video call.

1996
01:06:44,435 --> 01:06:45,579
There is a button that is shaped like a camera.

1997
01:06:45,904 --> 01:06:47,610
- I am alone. - Where are you? Make a turn.

1998
01:06:48,335 --> 01:06:50,050
I am alone. I am on the roof.

1999
01:06:50,435 --> 01:06:52,604
- I am alone. Here. - You really are telling the truth.

2000
01:06:52,605 --> 01:06:54,450
Hold on. Maybe they're hiding. Tilt the camera to the floor.

2001
01:06:54,475 --> 01:06:56,289
I don't have time. I need to go.

2002
01:06:56,375 --> 01:06:57,619
What is it going to be?

2003
01:06:57,685 --> 01:06:59,320
Seok Jin, how are you going to help us?

2004
01:06:59,484 --> 01:07:01,414
We will go to 1 of the 2 places.

2005
01:07:01,415 --> 01:07:03,014
- We haven't made a decision yet. - Where will you go?

2006
01:07:03,015 --> 01:07:05,454
Anyang First Street or Sinsung High School.

2007
01:07:05,455 --> 01:07:08,030
If you lead the team to Sinsung High School...

2008
01:07:08,495 --> 01:07:10,400
- Okay. I will do that. - Okay.

2009
01:07:11,495 --> 01:07:14,410
Then let's take 1,000 dollars each.

2010
01:07:14,435 --> 01:07:15,669
We can't do that.

2011
01:07:15,794 --> 01:07:17,369
That's absurd.

2012
01:07:17,964 --> 01:07:19,539
You can't do that?

2013
01:07:19,665 --> 01:07:21,773
We can't do that when we are struggling this much.

2014
01:07:21,774 --> 01:07:23,403
- Seok Jin. - Give me 800 dollars.

2015
01:07:23,404 --> 01:07:25,144
The roof of my mouth is burnt.

2016
01:07:25,145 --> 01:07:27,650
Take 1,100 dollars each and give me 800 dollars.

2017
01:07:28,044 --> 01:07:30,019
Okay. They are coming. I am hanging up.

2018
01:07:30,645 --> 01:07:33,744
If this is for real, he will be a big help.

2019
01:07:33,745 --> 01:07:36,130
- He will be a big help. - Seriously.

2020
01:07:36,984 --> 01:07:38,229
If I take their side,

2021
01:07:38,924 --> 01:07:41,454
I would get 500 dollars at the very least.

2022
01:07:41,455 --> 01:07:43,829
(Will the runaways and Seok Jin's strategy succeed?)

2023
01:07:45,325 --> 01:07:46,999
They are daring.

2024
01:07:47,294 --> 01:07:48,934
- They are daring. - While we were in the room,

2025
01:07:48,935 --> 01:07:51,164
- they ordered takeout. - They ordered takeout.

2026
01:07:51,165 --> 01:07:53,434
It suits their style.

2027
01:07:53,435 --> 01:07:55,374
In any case, they completed two missions.

2028
01:07:55,375 --> 01:07:56,434
- My goodness. - They have one left.

2029
01:07:56,435 --> 01:07:58,249
They ridiculed us.

2030
01:07:58,774 --> 01:08:00,780
This is what Se Chan said to me.

2031
01:08:01,274 --> 01:08:02,443
When I asked him, "Who are you?"

2032
01:08:02,444 --> 01:08:03,619
He said, "We are a team."

2033
01:08:03,944 --> 01:08:05,043
"The runaways and I are a team."

2034
01:08:05,044 --> 01:08:06,820
- Stop lying. - He said that.

2035
01:08:07,214 --> 01:08:09,260
- So Min. - It's on the camera.

2036
01:08:09,285 --> 01:08:10,813
You will know once this episode airs.

2037
01:08:10,814 --> 01:08:12,554
Don't you remember what you said to me?

2038
01:08:12,555 --> 01:08:14,499
Do you know what she said to me?

2039
01:08:15,024 --> 01:08:16,224
She asked me to give her 300 dollars.

2040
01:08:16,225 --> 01:08:17,923
(She said she will be a spy.)

2041
01:08:17,924 --> 01:08:20,200
- When did I say that? - My goodness.

2042
01:08:21,194 --> 01:08:24,309
What is going on? Did they abandon you or what?

2043
01:08:24,364 --> 01:08:26,039
- We are a team. - Hold on.

2044
01:08:26,305 --> 01:08:27,510
Then I will help you.

2045
01:08:27,835 --> 01:08:29,910
Give me 300 dollars. Each of you can give me 100 dollars each.

2046
01:08:30,575 --> 01:08:31,803
(So Min made an offer to be a spy.)

2047
01:08:31,804 --> 01:08:33,473
Gosh, I can't trust So Min.

2048
01:08:33,474 --> 01:08:34,643
- Hey. - My goodness.

2049
01:08:34,644 --> 01:08:36,544
- Hey. - Gosh, I can't trust So Min.

2050
01:08:36,545 --> 01:08:37,714
You asked me to give you 300 dollars.

2051
01:08:37,715 --> 01:08:39,483
- Hey. - When did I do that?

2052
01:08:39,484 --> 01:08:41,053
Are you really going to be this way?

2053
01:08:41,054 --> 01:08:42,853
Shouldn't we hurry up and go somewhere?

2054
01:08:42,854 --> 01:08:45,023
I recommend Anyang First Street.

2055
01:08:45,024 --> 01:08:46,153
(The former runaway recommends Anyang First Street.)

2056
01:08:46,154 --> 01:08:47,353
(I have to lead them to Sinsung High School.)

2057
01:08:47,354 --> 01:08:49,994
Jong Kook's memories as a student would be at the school.

2058
01:08:49,995 --> 01:08:51,294
They wouldn't go there. I am 100 percent sure of it.

2059
01:08:51,295 --> 01:08:52,424
(They don't want to take a class.)

2060
01:08:52,425 --> 01:08:56,094
How are we supposed to trust you? We shouldn't trust a captive.

2061
01:08:56,095 --> 01:08:57,509
- Let me tell you this. - You know,

2062
01:08:57,835 --> 01:09:00,103
he will get some money...

2063
01:09:00,104 --> 01:09:01,179
- if they win. - No, I won't!

2064
01:09:01,774 --> 01:09:03,004
I don't think it's Anyang First Street.

2065
01:09:03,005 --> 01:09:04,334
We have to do the opposite of what Se Chan says.

2066
01:09:04,335 --> 01:09:06,479
- The school. - Let's go to the school.

2067
01:09:06,575 --> 01:09:09,113
I think we should hurry over to Sinsung High School.

2068
01:09:09,114 --> 01:09:10,420
We would be able to check right away.

2069
01:09:10,444 --> 01:09:11,943
Let's check and hit the road if we are wrong.

2070
01:09:11,944 --> 01:09:13,259
That would be for the best.

2071
01:09:14,715 --> 01:09:17,353
I think they went to Sinsung High School. It's close.

2072
01:09:17,354 --> 01:09:19,284
(The chasers set out for Sinsung High School.)

2073
01:09:19,285 --> 01:09:20,460
- When you get off, - Yes?

2074
01:09:20,854 --> 01:09:23,200
make sure people don't notice you.

2075
01:09:23,325 --> 01:09:25,599
- You know what I mean, right? - Of course.

2076
01:09:26,064 --> 01:09:27,693
We will go to the left.

2077
01:09:27,694 --> 01:09:29,664
- Please get moving right away. - Okay.

2078
01:09:29,665 --> 01:09:30,910
(They don't want to leave any evidence.)

2079
01:09:31,104 --> 01:09:35,403
(The 2 runaways run to the pork cutlet diner.)

2080
01:09:35,404 --> 01:09:36,580
Hurry up.

2081
01:09:36,875 --> 01:09:38,803
(They will succeed if they eat the pork cutlet Jong Kook ate.)

2082
01:09:38,804 --> 01:09:40,349
- No way. - Hello.

2083
01:09:40,474 --> 01:09:41,544
- Hello. - No way.

2084
01:09:41,545 --> 01:09:42,620
Ma'am,

2085
01:09:42,644 --> 01:09:44,744
this is the only exit, right?

2086
01:09:44,745 --> 01:09:46,759
- There is another exit. - Is there another exit?

2087
01:09:46,785 --> 01:09:48,714
Please give us two pork cutlets.

2088
01:09:48,715 --> 01:09:49,860
- All right. - Thank you.

2089
01:09:50,484 --> 01:09:52,099
Kwang Soo, the exit is here.

2090
01:09:52,184 --> 01:09:53,784
There is a back door.

2091
01:09:53,785 --> 01:09:55,523
(They find an emergency exit at the back.)

2092
01:09:55,524 --> 01:09:57,294
- This is good. - There is a back door.

2093
01:09:57,295 --> 01:09:58,393
There is a back door.

2094
01:09:58,394 --> 01:09:59,939
(The back door and the front door)

2095
01:10:00,125 --> 01:10:03,164
It's hard to track them down this way.

2096
01:10:03,165 --> 01:10:04,294
(The chasers are on their way to Sinsung High School.)

2097
01:10:04,295 --> 01:10:06,704
(They try to call the runaways.)

2098
01:10:06,705 --> 01:10:08,049
They wouldn't answer.

2099
01:10:08,535 --> 01:10:10,179
They wouldn't answer your call.

2100
01:10:10,675 --> 01:10:13,179
I am annoyed because we came so close to catching them.

2101
01:10:13,944 --> 01:10:15,820
It's a call from Haha.

2102
01:10:16,444 --> 01:10:17,620
- Kwang Soo. - Haha.

2103
01:10:18,285 --> 01:10:20,389
I could see that you didn't skip a meal.

2104
01:10:20,814 --> 01:10:23,013
(Oh, that's right.)

2105
01:10:23,014 --> 01:10:24,360
Did you enjoy the seolleongtang?

2106
01:10:25,455 --> 01:10:27,160
It was so good.

2107
01:10:27,255 --> 01:10:29,469
We will be done after we eat this here.

2108
01:10:30,255 --> 01:10:31,664
I have a question, Kwang Soo.

2109
01:10:31,665 --> 01:10:33,670
We will be done after we eat this here.

2110
01:10:33,724 --> 01:10:36,393
(What did you say just now?)

2111
01:10:36,394 --> 01:10:38,410
Do you really think you will win?

2112
01:10:39,864 --> 01:10:41,580
Why did you say that?

2113
01:10:42,175 --> 01:10:44,280
We will be done after we eat this here.

2114
01:10:44,604 --> 01:10:46,704
- I have a question, Kwang Soo. - Yes?

2115
01:10:46,705 --> 01:10:49,214
- Do you really think you will win? - He hung up.

2116
01:10:49,215 --> 01:10:51,719
- What? - Jae Seok keeps hanging up.

2117
01:10:51,745 --> 01:10:53,013
(Flustered)

2118
01:10:53,014 --> 01:10:54,320
Are you insane?

2119
01:10:55,684 --> 01:10:57,414
(Flustered)

2120
01:10:57,415 --> 01:10:59,460
You gave them a hint!

2121
01:11:00,854 --> 01:11:03,099
- Did I do that? - You talked about eating.

2122
01:11:03,154 --> 01:11:04,500
- Did I do that? - For goodness' sake.

2123
01:11:05,925 --> 01:11:07,023
How could you...

2124
01:11:07,024 --> 01:11:09,040
(He confessed that he is at a restaurant.)

2125
01:11:10,035 --> 01:11:11,204
Did...

2126
01:11:11,205 --> 01:11:13,780
Did Kwang Soo just give me a hint over the phone?

2127
01:11:14,064 --> 01:11:15,933
I think he said it without thinking but...

2128
01:11:15,934 --> 01:11:17,334
"We will be done after we eat this here."

2129
01:11:17,335 --> 01:11:19,250
If he was telling the truth,

2130
01:11:19,404 --> 01:11:21,103
they aren't at Sinsung High School.

2131
01:11:21,104 --> 01:11:23,150
- That's right. - Gap Jin didn't tell them...

2132
01:11:23,314 --> 01:11:25,313
- about Sinsung Festival. - They don't know about it.

2133
01:11:25,314 --> 01:11:26,544
He didn't tell them about the festival.

2134
01:11:26,545 --> 01:11:30,084
(They don't know that Jong Kook gave a performance at the festival.)

2135
01:11:30,085 --> 01:11:31,360
Why don't we go to Anyang First Street?

2136
01:11:32,184 --> 01:11:35,254
(Will they go to Anyang First Street?)

2137
01:11:35,255 --> 01:11:36,954
If we turn right, we will reach Anyang First Street.

2138
01:11:36,955 --> 01:11:38,170
Let's go to Anyang First Street.

2139
01:11:38,194 --> 01:11:40,200
Please turn right and go to Anyang First Street.

2140
01:11:40,264 --> 01:11:42,939
They are at Anyang First Street.

2141
01:11:42,995 --> 01:11:44,410
At the entrance,

2142
01:11:44,804 --> 01:11:47,363
we should ask people if they saw them.

2143
01:11:47,364 --> 01:11:48,650
Then we will know where they headed.

2144
01:11:48,734 --> 01:11:51,473
Let's get off at the entrance. That's the main street.

2145
01:11:51,474 --> 01:11:52,844
- Let's do that. - That's the main street.

2146
01:11:52,845 --> 01:11:55,513
We will hit the main street right away.

2147
01:11:55,514 --> 01:11:56,973
This is Anyang First Street.

2148
01:11:56,974 --> 01:11:59,089
We should get off here. Let's get off.

2149
01:11:59,314 --> 01:12:00,490
The pork cutlet is here.

2150
01:12:01,045 --> 01:12:02,284
- Thank you. - Here you go.

2151
01:12:02,285 --> 01:12:03,460
Thank you.

2152
01:12:04,285 --> 01:12:05,454
It's a hearty dish.

2153
01:12:05,455 --> 01:12:07,353
(This famous pork cutlet was approved by the son of Anyang.)

2154
01:12:07,354 --> 01:12:09,500
(The runaways will win once they eat it.)

2155
01:12:09,995 --> 01:12:11,324
You know how I eat pork cutlet, right?

2156
01:12:11,325 --> 01:12:13,040
I eat one piece by itself and mix the other piece.

2157
01:12:13,864 --> 01:12:15,710
I wish there was some corn.

2158
01:12:16,764 --> 01:12:18,034
(Peeking)

2159
01:12:18,035 --> 01:12:19,834
(They're not here, right?)

2160
01:12:19,835 --> 01:12:21,679
Let's pay first.

2161
01:12:22,675 --> 01:12:24,780
- We would like to pay. - Okay.

2162
01:12:25,075 --> 01:12:26,544
Do you have any corn?

2163
01:12:26,545 --> 01:12:28,574
(Do you have any corn?)

2164
01:12:28,575 --> 01:12:30,074
- Why are you looking for corn? - We would like to pay.

2165
01:12:30,075 --> 01:12:31,250
(We are runaways.)

2166
01:12:31,885 --> 01:12:33,214
I usually mix it with rice.

2167
01:12:33,215 --> 01:12:35,559
(Running away should come after eating.)

2168
01:12:35,684 --> 01:12:37,089
To run away,

2169
01:12:37,385 --> 01:12:38,799
we need to pay in advance.

2170
01:12:39,684 --> 01:12:41,893
(The chasers search Anyang First Street.)

2171
01:12:41,894 --> 01:12:43,030
This street is...

2172
01:12:43,394 --> 01:12:45,063
(There is a fast-food restaurant Jong Kook used to frequent.)

2173
01:12:45,064 --> 01:12:46,900
They aren't here, are they?

2174
01:12:47,564 --> 01:12:49,134
- I don't think they are here. - Did Yu Jae Seok come?

2175
01:12:49,135 --> 01:12:50,263
- No. - My goodness.

2176
01:12:50,264 --> 01:12:52,009
Is he on the second floor?

2177
01:12:52,205 --> 01:12:53,410
- Is no one here? - No one is here.

2178
01:12:54,904 --> 01:12:59,450
(The runaways begins to cut the pork cutlet.)

2179
01:13:02,075 --> 01:13:03,790
- We need to eat everything, right? - Yes.

2180
01:13:04,415 --> 01:13:05,820
You succeed as soon as you are done.

2181
01:13:06,085 --> 01:13:07,820
Has anyone seen Yu Jae Seok?

2182
01:13:08,514 --> 01:13:09,929
Has anyone seen Lee Kwang Soo?

2183
01:13:10,785 --> 01:13:13,124
(While the chasers look for them)

2184
01:13:13,125 --> 01:13:16,070
(Peeking)

2185
01:13:16,524 --> 01:13:18,070
Let's take a peek outside between bites.

2186
01:13:18,425 --> 01:13:21,000
(Peeking)

2187
01:13:21,595 --> 01:13:23,134
Look closely.

2188
01:13:23,135 --> 01:13:26,509
(The chasers begin to close in on them.)

2189
01:13:27,804 --> 01:13:31,303
Why is there a crowd?

2190
01:13:31,304 --> 01:13:32,879
There is a crowd.

2191
01:13:33,675 --> 01:13:36,244
(The street of Anyang is pretty empty,)

2192
01:13:36,245 --> 01:13:38,714
(but there is a crowd at one spot.)

2193
01:13:38,715 --> 01:13:39,889
They must be over there!

2194
01:13:40,845 --> 01:13:43,754
(Something doesn't feel right.)

2195
01:13:43,755 --> 01:13:46,030
At this rate, I would get an upset stomach.

2196
01:13:47,255 --> 01:13:49,629
- Why is there a crowd? Why? - Why is there a crowd?

2197
01:13:49,825 --> 01:13:51,670
What is it? Are they up there?

2198
01:13:52,364 --> 01:13:53,594
Up there?

2199
01:13:53,595 --> 01:13:55,094
(The residents of Anyang point to one place.)

2200
01:13:55,095 --> 01:13:56,269
This is it.

2201
01:13:56,864 --> 01:13:59,210
(It's the pork cutlet diner.)

2202
01:14:00,505 --> 01:14:01,634
(Startled)

2203
01:14:01,635 --> 01:14:02,879
They're here!

2204
01:14:03,175 --> 01:14:04,534
(He spots the chasers.)

2205
01:14:04,535 --> 01:14:05,973
They're here! Let's move!

2206
01:14:05,974 --> 01:14:07,844
(Jae Seok and Kwang Soo escape through the back door.)

2207
01:14:07,845 --> 01:14:08,990
Jong Kook is here.

2208
01:14:10,014 --> 01:14:11,389
What? There they are!

2209
01:14:12,215 --> 01:14:14,643
- Where are they? - Where?

2210
01:14:14,644 --> 01:14:15,830
Run away!

2211
01:14:16,385 --> 01:14:18,584
(Running)

2212
01:14:18,585 --> 01:14:20,884
(At that moment)

2213
01:14:20,885 --> 01:14:22,129
My goodness.

2214
01:14:23,495 --> 01:14:26,040
(Jong Kook enters through the back door.)

2215
01:14:26,224 --> 01:14:28,464
(They get caught!)

2216
01:14:28,465 --> 01:14:29,534
(Jong Kook charges forward.)

2217
01:14:29,535 --> 01:14:30,834
Run!

2218
01:14:30,835 --> 01:14:32,710
Get them!

2219
01:14:33,535 --> 01:14:36,603
(They run back into the pork cutlet diner.)

2220
01:14:36,604 --> 01:14:38,420
(My goodness!)

2221
01:14:39,575 --> 01:14:43,143
(Kwang Soo locked the door.)

2222
01:14:43,144 --> 01:14:45,683
(I have to survive!)

2223
01:14:45,684 --> 01:14:49,030
(The master of betrayal tries to escape through the front door.)

2224
01:14:49,814 --> 01:14:51,059
I got you!

2225
01:14:51,215 --> 01:14:52,924
(Jae Seok is apprehended.)

2226
01:14:52,925 --> 01:14:54,124
So this is where you were.

2227
01:14:54,125 --> 01:14:55,954
They were eating.

2228
01:14:55,955 --> 01:14:57,170
My goodness.

2229
01:14:57,255 --> 01:14:59,200
Kwang Soo locked the door.

2230
01:14:59,795 --> 01:15:01,763
(The man who fell behind cries out in desperation.)

2231
01:15:01,764 --> 01:15:03,009
Kwang Soo!

2232
01:15:03,394 --> 01:15:05,263
- Come here. - Kwang Soo locked the door.

2233
01:15:05,264 --> 01:15:06,634
(After showing the true side of their friendship,)

2234
01:15:06,635 --> 01:15:10,134
(Kwang Soo escapes the pork cutlet diner.)

2235
01:15:10,135 --> 01:15:13,280
(He runs away without the production crew.)

2236
01:15:13,904 --> 01:15:17,574
(The production crew filmed this with a cellphone.)

2237
01:15:17,575 --> 01:15:20,889
(Kwang Soo-Papillon of Anyang)

2238
01:15:21,144 --> 01:15:22,784
- He got out this way. - That's right.

2239
01:15:22,785 --> 01:15:24,313
- He's out of the building. - He's out of the building.

2240
01:15:24,314 --> 01:15:25,784
- Did he come out? - He came out.

2241
01:15:25,785 --> 01:15:27,924
- Did Kwang Soo leave? - Which way did he go?

2242
01:15:27,925 --> 01:15:29,424
- Which way did he go? - That way.

2243
01:15:29,425 --> 01:15:30,530
He went that way.

2244
01:15:30,724 --> 01:15:32,523
(Kwang Soo managed to lose the chasers.)

2245
01:15:32,524 --> 01:15:33,839
I remember what Jong Kook said.

2246
01:15:34,524 --> 01:15:36,939
He said the mother of the woman he dated in the past...

2247
01:15:37,734 --> 01:15:40,240
ran a restaurant there.

2248
01:15:41,165 --> 01:15:44,973
(There are a few places I can think of off the top of my head.)

2249
01:15:44,974 --> 01:15:47,174
(I have memories of the underground shopping area.)

2250
01:15:47,175 --> 01:15:50,443
(His ex-girlfriend's mom ran a restaurant there.)

2251
01:15:50,444 --> 01:15:52,820
I can ask people in one of these old buildings.

2252
01:15:53,345 --> 01:15:54,490
Hello.

2253
01:15:54,545 --> 01:15:57,089
Did Jong Kook ever buy shoes here?

2254
01:15:57,154 --> 01:15:58,500
Okay, thank you.

2255
01:15:58,984 --> 01:16:01,553
- He's gone far from here. - I think so too.

2256
01:16:01,554 --> 01:16:03,000
He won't stay nearby.

2257
01:16:03,255 --> 01:16:05,799
Hello, did Jong Kook ever come here?

2258
01:16:05,864 --> 01:16:07,240
He didn't come today.

2259
01:16:07,295 --> 01:16:09,534
- Did he ever come? - No.

2260
01:16:09,535 --> 01:16:10,710
Thank you.

2261
01:16:11,135 --> 01:16:12,839
- Hey. - Hey.

2262
01:16:12,864 --> 01:16:14,134
- Jae Seok. - He's right there.

2263
01:16:14,135 --> 01:16:16,334
- He's right there. - There he is.

2264
01:16:16,335 --> 01:16:17,403
Right there.

2265
01:16:17,404 --> 01:16:19,643
(Kwang Soo got caught.)

2266
01:16:19,644 --> 01:16:21,813
- There. It's Kwang Soo. - There he is.

2267
01:16:21,814 --> 01:16:22,950
Darn it.

2268
01:16:23,144 --> 01:16:24,143
Good luck!

2269
01:16:24,144 --> 01:16:27,183
(He needs one more place to win.)

2270
01:16:27,184 --> 01:16:28,254
There!

2271
01:16:28,255 --> 01:16:29,714
(The chasers run after him across the street.)

2272
01:16:29,715 --> 01:16:31,660
Haha, the traffic light!

2273
01:16:32,825 --> 01:16:34,200
(Gosh!)

2274
01:16:34,724 --> 01:16:37,254
(The chasers are across the street.)

2275
01:16:37,255 --> 01:16:39,624
(They dash across the crosswalk.)

2276
01:16:39,625 --> 01:16:40,863
He's too fast!

2277
01:16:40,864 --> 01:16:43,339
(7 Running Man members versus Kwang Soo in the middle of the day)

2278
01:16:43,535 --> 01:16:46,103
(They're only 50m away from him.)

2279
01:16:46,104 --> 01:16:47,534
(Will he get caught...)

2280
01:16:47,535 --> 01:16:49,549
(or get away?)

2281
01:16:50,505 --> 01:16:52,679
Kwang Soo! It's me.

2282
01:16:52,845 --> 01:16:54,019
Kwang Soo!

2283
01:16:54,505 --> 01:16:58,049
(He doesn't look back once.)

2284
01:16:58,245 --> 01:16:59,313
Opposite side.

2285
01:16:59,314 --> 01:17:01,120
Go to the opposite side.

2286
01:17:01,215 --> 01:17:03,330
Opposite side! Go to the opposite side.

2287
01:17:03,755 --> 01:17:05,284
So Min, go the opposite way.

2288
01:17:05,285 --> 01:17:06,353
Opposite side?

2289
01:17:06,354 --> 01:17:08,370
- Where? - Right!

2290
01:17:09,295 --> 01:17:11,070
Go right, So Min.

2291
01:17:11,524 --> 01:17:12,740
Come this way!

2292
01:17:13,364 --> 01:17:15,464
(Runaway Kwang Soo enters the underground shopping area.)

2293
01:17:15,465 --> 01:17:16,763
Give me money.

2294
01:17:16,764 --> 01:17:19,479
Give me money or a credit card. Hurry. Anything.

2295
01:17:19,864 --> 01:17:24,150
(The last runaway enters the underground shopping area.)

2296
01:17:25,474 --> 01:17:26,574
Excuse me.

2297
01:17:26,575 --> 01:17:28,004
(Jae Seok is right after him.)

2298
01:17:28,005 --> 01:17:31,820
(They enter through different entrances.)

2299
01:17:34,245 --> 01:17:35,360
Food.

2300
01:17:35,484 --> 01:17:37,189
Where's the tteokbokki place?

2301
01:17:37,484 --> 01:17:39,759
Tteokbokki place.

2302
01:17:40,224 --> 01:17:42,294
(He needs to copy one thing Jong Kook did here to win.)

2303
01:17:42,295 --> 01:17:43,599
- Where's Kwang Soo? - He went there.

2304
01:17:43,795 --> 01:17:46,870
(Will Kwang Soo accomplish the mission?)

2305
01:17:46,894 --> 01:17:47,969
Sir!

2306
01:17:48,125 --> 01:17:50,410
Anything. Here.

2307
01:17:50,635 --> 01:17:53,063
(Jong Kook is sprinting.)

2308
01:17:53,064 --> 01:17:54,363
What should I get?

2309
01:17:54,364 --> 01:17:56,049
(Jong Kook probably got something from the general store.)

2310
01:17:56,304 --> 01:17:57,403
Hurry. Anything.

2311
01:17:57,404 --> 01:17:58,903
(Will he buy Jong Kook's favorite toy and win?)

2312
01:17:58,904 --> 01:17:59,943
Anything.

2313
01:17:59,944 --> 01:18:01,943
(The son of Anyang is here.)

2314
01:18:01,944 --> 01:18:03,049
Anything!

2315
01:18:04,774 --> 01:18:06,344
(Ripping)

2316
01:18:06,345 --> 01:18:09,353
(Kwang Soo is caught.)

2317
01:18:09,354 --> 01:18:13,759
(Jong Kook catches Kwang Soo 1 second before he buys something.)

2318
01:18:14,854 --> 01:18:16,969
Will you or I win? This is to be continued.

2319
01:18:17,154 --> 01:18:18,469
You call yourself a person?

2320
01:18:19,064 --> 01:18:20,393
The chasers win!

2321
01:18:20,394 --> 01:18:22,170
- All right! - I just had to pay.

2322
01:18:22,465 --> 01:18:24,370
I just had to pay.

2323
01:18:25,335 --> 01:18:27,910
- Goodness. - Spies are the scariest.

2324
01:18:28,165 --> 01:18:30,549
This is the 3,000 dollars as promised.

2325
01:18:30,705 --> 01:18:32,004
- Really? - Goodness.

2326
01:18:32,005 --> 01:18:33,473
They weren't lying?

2327
01:18:33,474 --> 01:18:34,744
I'll give it to you, Jong Kook.

2328
01:18:34,745 --> 01:18:36,519
Really? Okay.

2329
01:18:37,144 --> 01:18:40,360
Give them 1,000 dollars. That's too much.

2330
01:18:40,444 --> 01:18:42,229
Why would you give them 3,000 dollars?

2331
01:18:42,354 --> 01:18:45,824
That's why you ran so hard too.

2332
01:18:45,825 --> 01:18:48,393
I thought this was so funny.

2333
01:18:48,394 --> 01:18:49,799
"Kwang Soo, it's me."

2334
01:18:50,154 --> 01:18:51,740
(As soon as the tables were turned)

2335
01:18:51,995 --> 01:18:53,439
"Kwang Soo, it's me."

2336
01:18:53,595 --> 01:18:54,893
(Let's split the prize money.)

2337
01:18:54,894 --> 01:18:57,210
(Don't forget.)

2338
01:18:57,795 --> 01:18:59,664
- 3,000 dollars? - He was so close.

2339
01:18:59,665 --> 01:19:02,479
For a moment, I didn't know which side to take.

2340
01:19:02,705 --> 01:19:04,773
- I didn't know. - Right?

2341
01:19:04,774 --> 01:19:06,074
That's what I thought.

2342
01:19:06,075 --> 01:19:07,844
- Seok Jin, - I sped up then slowed down.

2343
01:19:07,845 --> 01:19:10,214
you're the worst person, so go to the end.

2344
01:19:10,215 --> 01:19:12,344
(You're the worst person, so go to the end.)

2345
01:19:12,345 --> 01:19:13,384
(You won't get any money.)

2346
01:19:13,385 --> 01:19:14,983
- Do you trust him? - Do I get a chance?

2347
01:19:14,984 --> 01:19:16,553
If you have a conscience, come here.

2348
01:19:16,554 --> 01:19:18,214
- Do I get a chance? - Yes.

2349
01:19:18,215 --> 01:19:20,683
Se Chan was on that team,

2350
01:19:20,684 --> 01:19:22,824
and it felt like he cared about them,

2351
01:19:22,825 --> 01:19:24,523
- Still. - but he kept saying First Street.

2352
01:19:24,524 --> 01:19:25,863
I kept on saying we had to go there.

2353
01:19:25,864 --> 01:19:27,863
- You brat. - What?

2354
01:19:27,864 --> 01:19:29,334
(I kept on saying we had to go there.)

2355
01:19:29,335 --> 01:19:31,393
(Hitting)

2356
01:19:31,394 --> 01:19:33,563
- You betrayed me in the beginning. - Look at this brat.

2357
01:19:33,564 --> 01:19:34,733
We didn't betray you.

2358
01:19:34,734 --> 01:19:35,910
Let me say one thing.

2359
01:19:36,035 --> 01:19:37,679
Who locked the door?

2360
01:19:38,404 --> 01:19:40,674
When Jae Seok got eliminated, who locked the door?

2361
01:19:40,675 --> 01:19:42,943
Are you human? Hey.

2362
01:19:42,944 --> 01:19:45,513
The three of us...

2363
01:19:45,514 --> 01:19:47,113
- Three of us? - will get 1,000 dollars each.

2364
01:19:47,114 --> 01:19:48,830
- What? - All right.

2365
01:19:49,184 --> 01:19:50,754
- It's over. - It's over then.

2366
01:19:50,755 --> 01:19:52,653
We'll do what we want with the money?

2367
01:19:52,654 --> 01:19:54,059
- It's up to you. - Okay.

2368
01:19:54,085 --> 01:19:56,794
- Can I get 100 dollars? - You're valuable.

2369
01:19:56,795 --> 01:19:57,900
Go ahead.

2370
01:19:58,125 --> 01:19:59,740
That's generous.

2371
01:19:59,825 --> 01:20:01,339
- You guys. - That's generous.

2372
01:20:01,625 --> 01:20:02,933
Share, okay?

2373
01:20:02,934 --> 01:20:04,233
(Be good friends.)

2374
01:20:04,234 --> 01:20:06,063
- What's wrong with you? - I'll give you 100 dollars.

2375
01:20:06,064 --> 01:20:07,903
- What's wrong with him? - Share.

2376
01:20:07,904 --> 01:20:09,634
I can't give you more.

2377
01:20:09,635 --> 01:20:10,773
You don't have to join if you don't want it.

2378
01:20:10,774 --> 01:20:11,803
- Jong Kook. - Yes.

2379
01:20:11,804 --> 01:20:13,849
Give me enough to pay for my gas back to Seoul.

2380
01:20:14,705 --> 01:20:15,914
Submit a receipt.

2381
01:20:15,915 --> 01:20:18,519
(Submit a receipt.)

2382
01:20:19,085 --> 01:20:21,013
- I'll send you the money. - What is he saying?

2383
01:20:21,014 --> 01:20:22,830
- Submit a receipt. - Is he for real?

2384
01:20:22,885 --> 01:20:24,553
- Haha, but I... - Look at the colors.

2385
01:20:24,554 --> 01:20:26,754
- I only did my best. - I kept on mentioning First Street.

2386
01:20:26,755 --> 01:20:27,884
Isn't this unfair?

2387
01:20:27,885 --> 01:20:29,330
- Come here, Se Chan. - Okay.

2388
01:20:29,625 --> 01:20:30,924
- He deserves something. - Great work.

2389
01:20:30,925 --> 01:20:32,424
- Good job. - Thank you!

2390
01:20:32,425 --> 01:20:33,939
- You can go home. - Thank you.

2391
01:20:34,524 --> 01:20:36,994
What did he do?

2392
01:20:36,995 --> 01:20:39,580
- Hey, why? - He behaves well.

2393
01:20:41,064 --> 01:20:43,034
(He behaves well.)

2394
01:20:43,035 --> 01:20:45,303
(I'll behave nicely too.)

2395
01:20:45,304 --> 01:20:47,643
(Am I cute?)

2396
01:20:47,644 --> 01:20:49,189
Who should we pick?

2397
01:20:49,715 --> 01:20:53,143
(Pick me.)

2398
01:20:53,144 --> 01:20:54,414
Pick, pick

2399
01:20:54,415 --> 01:20:57,914
(She tries to act cute using her hips.)

2400
01:20:57,915 --> 01:21:01,030
(Pick me up, lift me)

2401
01:21:02,095 --> 01:21:03,353
No, not you.

2402
01:21:03,354 --> 01:21:04,624
He said it's not you.

2403
01:21:04,625 --> 01:21:07,464
(After he's seen everything)

2404
01:21:07,465 --> 01:21:10,193
I can't give you any. You're so nasty.

2405
01:21:10,194 --> 01:21:12,204
- Thank you. - Thank you.

2406
01:21:12,205 --> 01:21:13,540
(Find Kim Jong Kook Race is over.)

2407
01:21:13,804 --> 01:21:15,250
Thank you for the money!

2408
01:21:16,535 --> 01:21:19,450
(It's getting chilly out, so they film inside.)

2409
01:21:19,505 --> 01:21:20,950
(Food is everything.)

2410
01:21:21,644 --> 01:21:24,790
(Each with their embellished dreams, they enter...)

2411
01:21:24,974 --> 01:21:26,513
(the Joker's house.)

2412
01:21:26,514 --> 01:21:28,983
(The Joker has started playing a game.)

2413
01:21:28,984 --> 01:21:31,189
(They can't laugh.)

2414
01:21:31,415 --> 01:21:34,454
(They've been doing this on Running Man for 9 years.)

2415
01:21:34,455 --> 01:21:35,700
(That was close.)

2416
01:21:35,995 --> 01:21:37,853
(Do you think this is over?)

2417
01:21:37,854 --> 01:21:39,900
(This is the first time he cried too.)

2418
01:21:41,064 --> 01:21:43,863
(Can they resist laughing and find the Joker?)

2419
01:21:43,864 --> 01:21:45,634
- What's wrong? - Don't do this.

2420
01:21:45,635 --> 01:21:46,979
(Joker's House)
