1
00:00:06,470 --> 00:00:08,308
- Hello, Ji Hyo. - Hi, Ji Hyo.

2
00:00:08,309 --> 00:00:09,909
My gosh, this is such a nice house.

3
00:00:09,910 --> 00:00:12,008
- This is a rich person's house. - Goodness.

4
00:00:12,009 --> 00:00:15,279
Turbo had its first practice right here in Yeonhui-dong.

5
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:16,579
- Really? - Really?

6
00:00:16,580 --> 00:00:18,548
- In Yeonhui-dong. - How many has that been?

7
00:00:18,549 --> 00:00:20,689
- About 20 years ago. - That was in 1995.

8
00:00:20,690 --> 00:00:22,359
(An old story 24 years ago)

9
00:00:22,360 --> 00:00:23,359
Gosh, that was in the 1990s.

10
00:00:23,360 --> 00:00:26,828
Most of our memories we talk about...

11
00:00:26,829 --> 00:00:28,159
- happened over 20 years ago. - They are from 20 years ago.

12
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:29,159
You came a long way.

13
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:30,999
It has to be more than 20 years to be called a memory.

14
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,429
- Right. That's so true. - Of course. Exactly.

15
00:00:33,430 --> 00:00:35,229
Seok Jin has memories from 50 years ago.

16
00:00:35,230 --> 00:00:36,238
That's right.

17
00:00:36,239 --> 00:00:37,445
(Seok Jin has memories from 50 years ago.)

18
00:00:37,569 --> 00:00:39,009
- That's right. - Of course.

19
00:00:39,010 --> 00:00:40,168
During the Korean War?

20
00:00:40,169 --> 00:00:42,479
He used to carry around three pairs of straw shoes.

21
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:46,125
- He'd change when they got old. - They would change into new ones.

22
00:00:46,209 --> 00:00:48,678
When all three of them wore down, he'd weave them all together again.

23
00:00:48,679 --> 00:00:51,095
Seok Jin's nickname is Straw Seok Jin.

24
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:53,089
- He always wore straw shoes. - Exactly.

25
00:00:53,090 --> 00:00:55,049
- Straw shoes. - I've been observing this,

26
00:00:55,050 --> 00:00:57,358
but Seok Jin gets attacked when he hasn't done anything.

27
00:00:57,359 --> 00:00:59,528
- That's true. - No, I don't see it that way.

28
00:00:59,529 --> 00:01:01,735
(No, I don't see it that way.)

29
00:01:02,059 --> 00:01:03,659
Why do you assume that?

30
00:01:03,660 --> 00:01:05,628
- I like it. I'm getting attention. - Do you like it?

31
00:01:05,629 --> 00:01:07,428
- Yes, we're giving him attention. - That's right.

32
00:01:07,429 --> 00:01:09,668
- Of course. - He's an attention-seeker.

33
00:01:09,669 --> 00:01:10,798
Yes, I'm an attention-seeker.

34
00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:13,308
By the way, So Min and SORAN finally...

35
00:01:13,309 --> 00:01:15,455
- started to perform together. - My gosh.

36
00:01:15,579 --> 00:01:16,854
- Without Jae Seok. - Right.

37
00:01:17,510 --> 00:01:19,209
You're going to events without us? That's not fair.

38
00:01:19,210 --> 00:01:22,748
- Jae Seok isn't joining you? - My position is very flexible.

39
00:01:22,749 --> 00:01:24,048
- You don't need to perform? - But So Min and SORAN will perform.

40
00:01:24,049 --> 00:01:26,248
- Someone can easily take your spot. - Right.

41
00:01:26,249 --> 00:01:28,188
Besides, Ko Young Bae adjusted the key to his, to begin with.

42
00:01:28,189 --> 00:01:29,695
Right, right.

43
00:01:29,990 --> 00:01:33,929
For the fan-meet, he divided it into three parts.

44
00:01:33,930 --> 00:01:35,975
But he already adjusted the key to his.

45
00:01:36,100 --> 00:01:38,558
By the way, they can perform this song at events now.

46
00:01:38,559 --> 00:01:40,168
Jong Kook, you can perform that alone, can't you?

47
00:01:40,169 --> 00:01:41,199
- Yes, I can. - Yes.

48
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:43,544
- I have a year-end tour. - You'll sing it there?

49
00:01:43,639 --> 00:01:45,709
I'll try to sing it with Haha during that concert.

50
00:01:45,710 --> 00:01:48,268
- We'll sing another song too. - Anyone can sing his part, right?

51
00:01:48,269 --> 00:01:50,184
(Anyone can sing his part, right?)

52
00:01:50,909 --> 00:01:53,849
Get someone from the street and practice for an hour and a half.

53
00:01:53,850 --> 00:01:55,518
- I think that could work. - But there should be...

54
00:01:55,519 --> 00:01:57,518
- a comic relief in that song. - Is that so?

55
00:01:57,519 --> 00:01:59,149
- Well, I see. - It's entertaining for my audience.

56
00:01:59,150 --> 00:02:00,449
- Okay. - He needs to do it.

57
00:02:00,450 --> 00:02:01,918
Did you meet Byul?

58
00:02:01,919 --> 00:02:03,218
- Did you meet Byul? - She...

59
00:02:03,219 --> 00:02:04,789
(A surprise meeting between So Min and Byul)

60
00:02:04,790 --> 00:02:07,289
- She wanted to treat me to a meal. - I saw it on your social media.

61
00:02:07,290 --> 00:02:09,828
So we met up because she wanted to treat me to a meal.

62
00:02:09,829 --> 00:02:10,929
All of a sudden? How did that happen?

63
00:02:10,930 --> 00:02:13,398
- Why did they meet? - We wanted to have a meal together,

64
00:02:13,399 --> 00:02:15,499
but we never got to for the past 2 or 3 years.

65
00:02:15,500 --> 00:02:18,368
And she asked me when I would be coming to see her.

66
00:02:18,369 --> 00:02:21,439
I see. So Byul gave you advice on dating when you shared your problem.

67
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:22,539
She...

68
00:02:22,540 --> 00:02:24,108
- Can I share this? She said, - What?

69
00:02:24,109 --> 00:02:26,178
"So Min, men are all foolish."

70
00:02:26,179 --> 00:02:29,078
"You need to find a less foolish man among foolish men."

71
00:02:29,079 --> 00:02:30,418
- Really? - That's what she said.

72
00:02:30,419 --> 00:02:31,979
Then why did she marry such a fool?

73
00:02:31,980 --> 00:02:34,918
If I'm following her logic, she found the most foolish man.

74
00:02:34,919 --> 00:02:35,988
She got the most foolish one.

75
00:02:35,989 --> 00:02:36,988
(According to her, she found the most foolish one.)

76
00:02:36,989 --> 00:02:38,659
(He only cares about his wife.)

77
00:02:38,660 --> 00:02:39,888
- He's the fool of the fools. - Right.

78
00:02:39,889 --> 00:02:42,358
And she scolded me a lot. She said, "Cut down on drinking."

79
00:02:42,359 --> 00:02:43,874
From what she told us,

80
00:02:43,929 --> 00:02:45,129
I think...

81
00:02:45,130 --> 00:02:46,729
she's a bit bossy.

82
00:02:46,730 --> 00:02:48,699
- Yes, she is. - Yes, she's bossy.

83
00:02:48,700 --> 00:02:49,914
- Right? - She's bossy.

84
00:02:49,940 --> 00:02:51,575
I didn't peg her to be bossy.

85
00:02:51,669 --> 00:02:53,009
- She's bossy. - She can be quite bossy.

86
00:02:53,010 --> 00:02:55,208
You know that I talk a lot, right?

87
00:02:55,209 --> 00:02:56,678
During the meal, I couldn't get a word in.

88
00:02:56,679 --> 00:02:57,708
Right.

89
00:02:57,709 --> 00:02:58,708
- Is she chatty? - Yes.

90
00:02:58,709 --> 00:03:00,509
- She talks... - Does she talk a lot?

91
00:03:00,510 --> 00:03:01,754
- so much. - Byul...

92
00:03:02,149 --> 00:03:04,425
- She does the same thing. - When it comes to dating,

93
00:03:04,750 --> 00:03:06,548
she has a lot of wisdom to share.

94
00:03:06,549 --> 00:03:08,719
- She's confident in that area. - Yes, she is.

95
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:10,135
(She's almost an expert.)

96
00:03:10,359 --> 00:03:12,289
- All right. - Everyone,

97
00:03:12,290 --> 00:03:14,534
- it's pretty hot today, right? - It's so hot.

98
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:16,874
Since it's hot today,

99
00:03:17,060 --> 00:03:18,874
you will stay inside the house...

100
00:03:18,970 --> 00:03:21,768
- until 6 p.m. - What?

101
00:03:21,769 --> 00:03:22,939
(The current time is 12 p.m.)

102
00:03:22,940 --> 00:03:24,039
- Really? - That's nice.

103
00:03:24,040 --> 00:03:25,545
- I like that we don't need to move. - That's nice.

104
00:03:26,139 --> 00:03:27,569
- Let's order jjajangmyeon. - Yes.

105
00:03:27,570 --> 00:03:29,178
- That sounds delicious. - You'll stay inside the house.

106
00:03:29,179 --> 00:03:31,939
You will discuss the schedule that you will follow today.

107
00:03:31,940 --> 00:03:33,309
Come up with more than five activities.

108
00:03:33,310 --> 00:03:36,219
- Please come up with a schedule. - That sounds fun.

109
00:03:36,220 --> 00:03:37,618
- Five? - Then...

110
00:03:37,619 --> 00:03:39,618
let's take Byul's crash course on dating one more time.

111
00:03:39,619 --> 00:03:40,949
- Let's invite her over. - Right.

112
00:03:40,950 --> 00:03:42,434
- Like a guest? - Yes.

113
00:03:42,459 --> 00:03:45,018
She can go on for six hours all by herself.

114
00:03:45,019 --> 00:03:46,404
- She'll need more time. - I'm sure of it.

115
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:47,689
- Suit yourself. - She can talk by herself.

116
00:03:47,690 --> 00:03:49,059
To start today's race,

117
00:03:49,060 --> 00:03:50,458
- you'll enter the house. - Okay!

118
00:03:50,459 --> 00:03:52,205
(To start today's race, they enter the house.)

119
00:03:53,570 --> 00:03:55,368
They turned the house into a studio set.

120
00:03:55,369 --> 00:03:57,599
- It's not a house, but a set. - It's like a vacation rental house.

121
00:03:57,600 --> 00:03:59,409
- This is a beautiful house. - There are a lot of houses...

122
00:03:59,410 --> 00:04:00,439
in Yeonhui-dong.

123
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:02,039
Gosh, this is a nice house with a nice view.

124
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:03,784
I'll give you the paper for your schedule.

125
00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:06,548
You're making us write a lot these days.

126
00:04:06,549 --> 00:04:08,254
It's not like we're at a school.

127
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:09,849
All right. "Schedule".

128
00:04:09,850 --> 00:04:11,325
Let's see.

129
00:04:11,350 --> 00:04:12,819
We should eat first.

130
00:04:12,820 --> 00:04:13,819
- Lunch. - We should.

131
00:04:13,820 --> 00:04:15,289
I'll go with jjamppong.

132
00:04:15,290 --> 00:04:16,358
- In that case, - Okay.

133
00:04:16,359 --> 00:04:17,488
- let's get jjajangmyeon. - Yes.

134
00:04:17,489 --> 00:04:18,719
- I like it. - Chinese food.

135
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:21,328
- Let's get jjamppong and tangsuyuk. - Tangsuyuk.

136
00:04:21,329 --> 00:04:22,705
- I like that. - Let's dip it in the sauce.

137
00:04:22,829 --> 00:04:24,328
- Let's get a rice dish. - No, let's get jjajangmyeon.

138
00:04:24,329 --> 00:04:25,768
This area is famous for burgers.

139
00:04:25,769 --> 00:04:27,468
- All right then. - Let's get a rice dish.

140
00:04:27,469 --> 00:04:29,245
- Let's gather everyone's opinions. - Okay.

141
00:04:29,300 --> 00:04:31,268
- Let's speak one at a time. - Okay.

142
00:04:31,269 --> 00:04:32,708
On a day like this,

143
00:04:32,709 --> 00:04:34,038
I think Chinese food will be perfect.

144
00:04:34,039 --> 00:04:35,809
- Like jjajangmyeon and jjamppong? - Yes, jjajangmyeon and jjamppong.

145
00:04:35,810 --> 00:04:37,414
- You can go next, Haha. - Yes.

146
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:39,179
I'd like to get a burger. We can get burgers...

147
00:04:39,180 --> 00:04:41,249
- and wings. - Wings?

148
00:04:41,250 --> 00:04:43,518
- I'll go with Chinese food. - Chinese food.

149
00:04:43,519 --> 00:04:44,549
I want to get tacos.

150
00:04:44,550 --> 00:04:47,495
(I want to get tacos.)

151
00:04:47,789 --> 00:04:49,018
Why not?

152
00:04:49,019 --> 00:04:50,518
Tacos are great. Let's get tacos.

153
00:04:50,519 --> 00:04:52,228
- We can get Mexican food. - I like tacos.

154
00:04:52,229 --> 00:04:53,388
- That's great. - Burritos are good too.

155
00:04:53,389 --> 00:04:54,534
- I can get a burrito. - Right.

156
00:04:54,829 --> 00:04:55,898
What else?

157
00:04:55,899 --> 00:04:57,559
- I want to get Chinese food. - Chinese food.

158
00:04:57,560 --> 00:04:58,974
- We have three votes. - What else?

159
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,174
- Vote for burgers. - I actually want to cook lunch.

160
00:05:01,329 --> 00:05:02,799
- You want to cook lunch? - On this hot day?

161
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:03,898
We're here, after all.

162
00:05:03,899 --> 00:05:05,768
I see a rice cooker there. And we're here together.

163
00:05:05,769 --> 00:05:07,408
Hey, ramyeon would be good.

164
00:05:07,409 --> 00:05:10,109
We can cook ramyeon and fried rice. We can eat them together.

165
00:05:10,110 --> 00:05:12,284
- We can put a fried egg on top. - Fried egg and ketchup.

166
00:05:12,950 --> 00:05:14,449
- That sounds good too. - Yes.

167
00:05:14,450 --> 00:05:15,978
All right, then. We've got a decision, Seok Jin.

168
00:05:15,979 --> 00:05:17,119
What about my vote?

169
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:18,379
(Chinese food gets 4 votes.)

170
00:05:18,380 --> 00:05:19,888
(Seok Jin's vote won't matter.)

171
00:05:19,889 --> 00:05:21,395
We're following the majority rule.

172
00:05:21,490 --> 00:05:22,819
- Seok Jin, why did you sit there? - Hey, ask my opinion too.

173
00:05:22,820 --> 00:05:24,234
- I've been thinking the whole time. - But...

174
00:05:24,289 --> 00:05:26,059
- You come here. - Why did you sit at the end?

175
00:05:26,060 --> 00:05:27,088
Okay.

176
00:05:27,089 --> 00:05:28,559
- Let's try this again. - Yes, try it again.

177
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:30,059
- What do you want? - I wanted to eat kalguksu.

178
00:05:30,060 --> 00:05:31,734
How about kalguksu?

179
00:05:32,930 --> 00:05:34,768
- Forget about that. - The noodles will get soggy.

180
00:05:34,769 --> 00:05:35,768
Let me tell you.

181
00:05:35,769 --> 00:05:37,838
I'll give you a chance to think...

182
00:05:37,839 --> 00:05:38,945
of a dish that will change our minds.

183
00:05:39,170 --> 00:05:40,914
- I don't need to think. - Go ahead.

184
00:05:40,969 --> 00:05:45,284
I make really mean kimchi fried rice.

185
00:05:45,610 --> 00:05:47,348
- I can cook kimchi fried rice. - You'll cook that?

186
00:05:47,349 --> 00:05:48,708
- You're going to cook? - I'll cook it.

187
00:05:48,709 --> 00:05:50,179
- If you're cooking... - Fine, I'll eat it.

188
00:05:50,180 --> 00:05:51,995
- I can cook it. - We don't need to help at all?

189
00:05:52,149 --> 00:05:53,619
- I'll eat it if you cook it. - You don't need to help.

190
00:05:53,620 --> 00:05:54,864
- I'll cook it. - Really?

191
00:05:54,920 --> 00:05:56,164
You'll wash the dishes too?

192
00:05:56,360 --> 00:05:58,765
- No, someone must wash the dishes. - Wait, no.

193
00:05:58,789 --> 00:06:00,205
- Do I have to do that too? - Wait.

194
00:06:00,529 --> 00:06:01,958
- Hey. - You're disappointing us.

195
00:06:01,959 --> 00:06:03,958
- He got mad at washing the dishes. - He's really mad.

196
00:06:03,959 --> 00:06:05,199
You're disappointing us.

197
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:07,199
- Why are you so mad? - I wasn't mad.

198
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:08,799
- They want me to wash dishes too. - Why are you angry?

199
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:10,468
The chef has to clean up too.

200
00:06:10,469 --> 00:06:12,468
No, I'll just cook.

201
00:06:12,469 --> 00:06:13,784
- You'll really cook everything? - Kimchi...

202
00:06:14,070 --> 00:06:15,439
I can cook kimchi fried rice.

203
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:17,278
- We don't have to help at all. - Right.

204
00:06:17,279 --> 00:06:19,749
All right. Set some time for lunch on the paper.

205
00:06:19,750 --> 00:06:21,379
- You can decide on the menu later. - Okay, let's do that.

206
00:06:21,380 --> 00:06:22,549
My gosh.

207
00:06:22,550 --> 00:06:24,648
It took that long to decide on food?

208
00:06:24,649 --> 00:06:26,419
We can eat for an hour, right?

209
00:06:26,420 --> 00:06:28,218
- We at least need two hours. - We need to digest the food too.

210
00:06:28,219 --> 00:06:30,718
- We need to buy food and all. - Right. We get to decide.

211
00:06:30,719 --> 00:06:33,458
Let's eat until 2 p.m. What should we do until 3 p.m. then?

212
00:06:33,459 --> 00:06:34,788
- We should have fun. It's a break. - Snack.

213
00:06:34,789 --> 00:06:36,328
We can play games during the break.

214
00:06:36,329 --> 00:06:38,429
- Let's play table tennis. - Then...

215
00:06:38,430 --> 00:06:39,929
- let's write an indoor activity. - Indoor activity.

216
00:06:39,930 --> 00:06:41,069
- We don't what it is. - Indoor activity.

217
00:06:41,070 --> 00:06:42,199
- Indoor activity. - Indoor activity.

218
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:45,544
From 3 p.m. to 4 p.m., we'll have snacks and desserts.

219
00:06:46,339 --> 00:06:47,369
- We keep eating. - Of course.

220
00:06:47,370 --> 00:06:49,538
- We eat and play. - Hey, when you go on a trip,

221
00:06:49,539 --> 00:06:52,208
- eating is all you do. - That's nice though.

222
00:06:52,209 --> 00:06:54,249
- From 4 p.m. to 5 p.m... - Games.

223
00:06:54,250 --> 00:06:55,424
Let's play Truth or Dare.

224
00:06:55,579 --> 00:06:57,049
- Truth or Dare? - Fine.

225
00:06:57,050 --> 00:06:59,718
- You like playing Truth or Dare. - Let's do it. Let's play a game.

226
00:06:59,719 --> 00:07:01,489
- Indoor game. - It's an indoor game.

227
00:07:01,490 --> 00:07:03,419
Wait. What's the difference between indoor activity and indoor game?

228
00:07:03,420 --> 00:07:05,164
- They are different. - They are?

229
00:07:05,190 --> 00:07:07,028
- Meals and desserts are different. - They are different.

230
00:07:07,029 --> 00:07:08,288
- "Indoor activity". - Indoor game.

231
00:07:08,289 --> 00:07:10,929
Won't we be hungry after we play an indoor game?

232
00:07:10,930 --> 00:07:11,999
- Right. - Right.

233
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,075
We should eat.

234
00:07:13,430 --> 00:07:14,528
- Refreshments. - Yes.

235
00:07:14,529 --> 00:07:16,544
(They are not snacks or desserts. They are refreshments.)

236
00:07:16,899 --> 00:07:18,398
(Refreshments: a general term for tea and snacks)

237
00:07:18,399 --> 00:07:19,908
- Hey, we eat and sleep. - Refreshments.

238
00:07:19,909 --> 00:07:24,038
"Lunch, an indoor activity, snacks, an indoor game, and snacks"?

239
00:07:24,039 --> 00:07:25,214
- Refreshments. - Refreshments.

240
00:07:25,339 --> 00:07:26,379
Refreshments.

241
00:07:26,380 --> 00:07:28,224
- Are you set until 6 p.m.? - Yes.

242
00:07:28,349 --> 00:07:29,978
- We're done. - All we'll do is eat and play.

243
00:07:29,979 --> 00:07:32,565
- We eat, play, and go home. - All we'll do is eat and play.

244
00:07:33,450 --> 00:07:34,619
Everyone,

245
00:07:34,620 --> 00:07:36,489
- please look at the TV. - Okay.

246
00:07:36,490 --> 00:07:38,765
(What? Look at the TV all of a sudden?)

247
00:07:38,820 --> 00:07:40,728
We just received this breaking news.

248
00:07:40,729 --> 00:07:41,958
(Goodness. What's going on?)

249
00:07:41,959 --> 00:07:43,174
- What is this? - What?

250
00:07:43,260 --> 00:07:45,174
(Breaking news?)

251
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:49,145
A mysterious virus has been rapidly spreading mainly in Seoul.

252
00:07:49,370 --> 00:07:51,214
It's called the REA Virus.

253
00:07:51,539 --> 00:07:52,614
"REA"?

254
00:07:53,310 --> 00:07:54,369
- "REA"? - "REA"?

255
00:07:54,370 --> 00:07:55,638
(What's that?)

256
00:07:55,639 --> 00:07:57,138
Once you are infected by the virus,

257
00:07:57,139 --> 00:07:59,408
it will wipe out your emotions and appetites.

258
00:07:59,409 --> 00:08:02,025
It will reset everything in your bio-system.

259
00:08:02,250 --> 00:08:03,619
It will get rid of our appetites?

260
00:08:03,620 --> 00:08:05,125
It will reset everything.

261
00:08:06,019 --> 00:08:08,419
As the route of the infection hasn't been located yet,

262
00:08:08,420 --> 00:08:09,788
refrain from going outside...

263
00:08:09,789 --> 00:08:11,794
and when you do, you must be especially careful.

264
00:08:12,789 --> 00:08:15,189
(Everyone is panicking at this breaking news.)

265
00:08:15,190 --> 00:08:16,299
However,

266
00:08:16,300 --> 00:08:17,728
the bio-terrorist...

267
00:08:17,729 --> 00:08:20,369
that spread the virus to the whole world...

268
00:08:20,370 --> 00:08:22,645
- is among you. - I knew it.

269
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:24,945
I knew it.

270
00:08:25,700 --> 00:08:27,484
What? It's not me.

271
00:08:27,639 --> 00:08:29,309
- Hey. - I have nothing to do with that.

272
00:08:29,310 --> 00:08:30,778
- You spoil my appetite. - Wait.

273
00:08:30,779 --> 00:08:31,908
- You ruin my appetite. - What?

274
00:08:31,909 --> 00:08:33,585
Wait, your singing kills my appetite.

275
00:08:33,709 --> 00:08:35,249
- Why me? - Your singing kills my appetite.

276
00:08:35,250 --> 00:08:36,625
- Why me? It's not me. - You know?

277
00:08:36,820 --> 00:08:38,248
I think it's Se Chan.

278
00:08:38,249 --> 00:08:39,649
- It's because... - No, it's not.

279
00:08:39,650 --> 00:08:41,019
your singing kills my appetite.

280
00:08:41,020 --> 00:08:43,258
I agree with that, but it's really not me.

281
00:08:43,259 --> 00:08:46,034
Within six hours, you must carry out everything on your schedule.

282
00:08:46,089 --> 00:08:48,128
And if you expose the bio-terrorist and eliminate him,

283
00:08:48,129 --> 00:08:50,758
surviving members will win the race and win a prize.

284
00:08:50,759 --> 00:08:53,569
And the bio-terrorist and infected members will face a penalty.

285
00:08:53,570 --> 00:08:55,998
If all of the members are infected,

286
00:08:55,999 --> 00:08:58,875
or if you fail to do everything on the schedule within the time limit,

287
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:00,584
the bio-terrorist will win.

288
00:09:00,609 --> 00:09:02,679
Two of the infected members, chosen by the bio-terrorist,

289
00:09:02,680 --> 00:09:04,454
will face the penalty.

290
00:09:04,609 --> 00:09:08,355
And outside this house, there are four mission routes.

291
00:09:08,979 --> 00:09:11,149
If you cannot carry out the activities in the house,

292
00:09:11,150 --> 00:09:14,765
one of the members can choose a route and go outside.

293
00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:18,988
But if you fail, you may be infected with the REA Virus, so be careful.

294
00:09:18,989 --> 00:09:20,965
You can find out how the infection spreads by going outside.

295
00:09:21,060 --> 00:09:22,628
Once you are infected by the virus,

296
00:09:22,629 --> 00:09:25,059
- there will be a mark on your face. - On the face?

297
00:09:25,060 --> 00:09:28,299
The infected member will come back home and follow the schedule.

298
00:09:28,300 --> 00:09:30,338
Once infected, you must rip off the name tag with your mouth...

299
00:09:30,339 --> 00:09:32,838
- to spread the virus. - With our mouth?

300
00:09:32,839 --> 00:09:34,238
(Remove the name tag with your mouth to spread the virus.)

301
00:09:34,239 --> 00:09:36,478
(We have to use our mouth to do it?)

302
00:09:36,479 --> 00:09:37,478
- How could we do that? - Those of you...

303
00:09:37,479 --> 00:09:39,149
with a protruding mouth...

304
00:09:39,150 --> 00:09:40,885
Jae Seok and me?

305
00:09:41,209 --> 00:09:43,519
However, if you're bothered by the infected member,

306
00:09:43,520 --> 00:09:44,519
remove the name tag with your hand.

307
00:09:44,520 --> 00:09:46,919
And the member will stand against the wall for five minutes.

308
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:50,618
I see. We'll be able to tell if someone is infected. We'll know.

309
00:09:50,619 --> 00:09:52,858
- That person will be a zombie. - For five minutes.

310
00:09:52,859 --> 00:09:55,105
Can the bio-terrorist infect us?

311
00:09:55,329 --> 00:09:56,628
- I would think so. - What can...

312
00:09:56,629 --> 00:09:57,958
- the bio-terrorist do? - The bio-terrorist...

313
00:09:57,959 --> 00:10:00,074
can't infect the other members.

314
00:10:00,229 --> 00:10:01,399
The bio-terrorist has to go outside.

315
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:04,069
Actually, the bio-terrorist is immune to the virus.

316
00:10:04,070 --> 00:10:06,939
(The bio-terrorist won't be infected by the REA Virus.)

317
00:10:06,940 --> 00:10:08,539
- He or she won't be infected? - Even if that person goes out?

318
00:10:08,540 --> 00:10:10,108
It'll be obvious if someone comes back without getting infected.

319
00:10:10,109 --> 00:10:12,608
- Right. - We should suspect that person.

320
00:10:12,609 --> 00:10:14,985
- If that's the case, we should. - Right.

321
00:10:15,009 --> 00:10:16,519
That person could have succeeded in the mission.

322
00:10:16,520 --> 00:10:18,118
My gosh, you added a twist.

323
00:10:18,119 --> 00:10:20,865
As for a way to eliminate the bio-terrorist,

324
00:10:20,890 --> 00:10:24,088
I'll tell you if you use all four of the mission routes.

325
00:10:24,089 --> 00:10:25,235
We have to do all of them.

326
00:10:25,759 --> 00:10:28,559
- You can follow your schedule now. - My gosh.

327
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:31,034
Bio-terrorist...

328
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:33,769
(Seok Jin is stuttering from the start.)

329
00:10:33,770 --> 00:10:34,828
Do they know who they are?

330
00:10:34,829 --> 00:10:36,498
It must be your first time hearing the word.

331
00:10:36,499 --> 00:10:38,275
So you're going to get rid of Seok Jin first?

332
00:10:38,900 --> 00:10:40,515
I just remembered this.

333
00:10:40,540 --> 00:10:42,885
I saw him in the room this morning, and when I went inside,

334
00:10:43,079 --> 00:10:45,855
the stylist kept drawing his eyebrows after seeing me.

335
00:10:46,479 --> 00:10:47,784
His eyebrows were already drawn though.

336
00:10:48,579 --> 00:10:50,419
- The stylist kept drawing... - Seok Jin...

337
00:10:50,420 --> 00:10:52,824
- his eyebrows again and again. - Seok Jin...

338
00:10:52,849 --> 00:10:55,488
- As if he just got started? - I have a photo.

339
00:10:55,489 --> 00:10:57,588
I have one too. It was really odd.

340
00:10:57,589 --> 00:10:58,694
What's this?

341
00:10:59,160 --> 00:11:00,704
- My eyebrows were that dark? - Look at this, everyone.

342
00:11:00,959 --> 00:11:02,735
- His are darker than Sin Chan's. - Really?

343
00:11:04,129 --> 00:11:06,769
Then, we have no choice but to go outside.

344
00:11:06,770 --> 00:11:07,799
Do we have to?

345
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:09,204
Don't we, if we want to eat?

346
00:11:09,300 --> 00:11:10,998
I hope the bio-terrorist goes out for us...

347
00:11:10,999 --> 00:11:12,314
- I mean, - if someone has to go out.

348
00:11:12,339 --> 00:11:13,738
to cook ramyeon...

349
00:11:13,739 --> 00:11:15,139
- We have to go out and buy it. - If...

350
00:11:15,140 --> 00:11:16,338
We can find food in the house.

351
00:11:16,339 --> 00:11:18,715
- Right here. - Let's look for food.

352
00:11:19,709 --> 00:11:21,378
(Will there be food inside the fridge?)

353
00:11:21,379 --> 00:11:23,419
See? I knew it. There's nothing to eat.

354
00:11:23,420 --> 00:11:24,694
(Empty refrigerator)

355
00:11:24,979 --> 00:11:26,095
There's nothing.

356
00:11:26,489 --> 00:11:27,549
In that case...

357
00:11:27,550 --> 00:11:28,848
Hey, I found rice here.

358
00:11:28,849 --> 00:11:29,858
(He found rice in the cabinet.)

359
00:11:29,859 --> 00:11:31,034
- We have rice? - Let's cook rice.

360
00:11:31,219 --> 00:11:32,958
- Let's cook rice. - We need more food though.

361
00:11:32,959 --> 00:11:34,858
- We can't just eat rice. - We need side dishes.

362
00:11:34,859 --> 00:11:37,228
We should go out and buy tteokbokki or something.

363
00:11:37,229 --> 00:11:38,659
All right. Here's my opinion.

364
00:11:38,660 --> 00:11:40,044
We should go to the convenience store...

365
00:11:40,329 --> 00:11:42,105
- and raid the store. - We need to buy food.

366
00:11:42,300 --> 00:11:44,039
- We have no choice. One of us... - Right.

367
00:11:44,040 --> 00:11:45,299
Let's choose someone suspicious.

368
00:11:45,300 --> 00:11:46,944
Someone who's not likely to succeed the mission.

369
00:11:47,239 --> 00:11:48,515
- Seok Jin. - Someone like Seok Jin.

370
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:51,279
- I think you should go out. - Why would I do that?

371
00:11:51,280 --> 00:11:53,179
- He's our prime suspect. - Right.

372
00:11:53,180 --> 00:11:54,924
- So we should make him go. - We ought to.

373
00:11:55,079 --> 00:11:57,118
I think he might end up facing the wall the whole time.

374
00:11:57,119 --> 00:11:59,519
If you come back after getting infected,

375
00:11:59,520 --> 00:12:01,019
we can just feel sorry.

376
00:12:01,020 --> 00:12:03,458
(It's so simple.)

377
00:12:03,459 --> 00:12:05,895
(I'm sorry, Seok Jin.)

378
00:12:06,530 --> 00:12:08,328
- All right. - It was a close call.

379
00:12:08,329 --> 00:12:09,358
It's not me.

380
00:12:09,359 --> 00:12:11,059
But you're the safest bet.

381
00:12:11,060 --> 00:12:12,628
I'm not the bio-terrorist.

382
00:12:12,629 --> 00:12:15,529
- Come on. - Can you go and buy ramyeon?

383
00:12:15,530 --> 00:12:16,998
- Seok Jin, buy tteokbokki. - Tuna.

384
00:12:16,999 --> 00:12:18,939
- Eggs. - Triangle gimbap.

385
00:12:18,940 --> 00:12:20,338
- Tuna. - How about dumplings?

386
00:12:20,339 --> 00:12:21,338
Get frozen ones.

387
00:12:21,339 --> 00:12:22,939
- And they sell cheese too. - I know.

388
00:12:22,940 --> 00:12:24,179
- Go raid the convenience store. - Buy some buns too.

389
00:12:24,180 --> 00:12:25,939
- Buy some eggs. - Crabmeat too.

390
00:12:25,940 --> 00:12:27,779
Seok Jin, you need to ramyeon for us to have lunch.

391
00:12:27,780 --> 00:12:29,248
And buy a bottle of cooking oil too.

392
00:12:29,249 --> 00:12:30,718
Seok Jin, buy some snacks too.

393
00:12:30,719 --> 00:12:32,248
- Snacks? - Hey, I like Snack Noodles.

394
00:12:32,249 --> 00:12:33,988
- Okay. - And jjajang ramyeon too.

395
00:12:33,989 --> 00:12:35,424
Okay!

396
00:12:35,650 --> 00:12:37,294
That's enough! I'll buy them.

397
00:12:37,619 --> 00:12:38,718
(Calm down and come back safe.)

398
00:12:38,719 --> 00:12:39,728
Seok Jin, go buy some food.

399
00:12:39,729 --> 00:12:42,034
Gosh. Why did they pick me?

400
00:12:43,129 --> 00:12:45,628
(What kinds of missions are awaiting?)

401
00:12:45,629 --> 00:12:46,699
What is this?

402
00:12:46,700 --> 00:12:48,304
(He spots something right away.)

403
00:12:49,070 --> 00:12:50,939
(There are 4 phones in front of him.)

404
00:12:50,940 --> 00:12:52,238
What are these?

405
00:12:52,239 --> 00:12:55,885
Please pick your route from 1 to 4.

406
00:12:56,379 --> 00:12:58,279
Do the routes differ depending on what I pick?

407
00:12:58,280 --> 00:12:59,355
Yes.

408
00:12:59,950 --> 00:13:02,895
(The route he'll take depends on which phone he picks.)

409
00:13:04,219 --> 00:13:05,878
(He's in a dilemma.)

410
00:13:05,879 --> 00:13:07,519
- This? - I pick this one.

411
00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:08,848
(He picks the farthest right.)

412
00:13:08,849 --> 00:13:10,758
You picked the first one.

413
00:13:10,759 --> 00:13:11,995
Route One.

414
00:13:12,589 --> 00:13:16,975
(What mission will it have?)

415
00:13:19,499 --> 00:13:23,699
(He checks the hidden mission.)

416
00:13:23,700 --> 00:13:26,039
(Curious)

417
00:13:26,040 --> 00:13:27,539
(Don't Laugh.)

418
00:13:27,540 --> 00:13:29,784
What? "Don't laugh."

419
00:13:30,310 --> 00:13:32,949
"If you don't laugh until you arrive at the destination, you pass."

420
00:13:32,950 --> 00:13:35,848
On your way to the convenience store,

421
00:13:35,849 --> 00:13:37,919
you won't be infected if you don't laugh.

422
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:40,625
But if you do, you will be infected immediately.

423
00:13:40,650 --> 00:13:41,988
I'll succeed if I don't laugh?

424
00:13:41,989 --> 00:13:43,858
(He'll pass if he doesn't laugh.)

425
00:13:43,859 --> 00:13:45,194
That's easy.

426
00:13:45,759 --> 00:13:48,059
I'm confident. This will be easy.

427
00:13:48,060 --> 00:13:49,505
(Will he truly succeed?)

428
00:13:50,129 --> 00:13:52,204
I think four cups will be enough.

429
00:13:52,229 --> 00:13:53,269
Will we eat this much?

430
00:13:53,270 --> 00:13:55,128
- This is more than enough. - Is this enough?

431
00:13:55,129 --> 00:13:56,899
Trust me. I can do this.

432
00:13:56,900 --> 00:13:58,299
I'll make stir-fried rice.

433
00:13:58,300 --> 00:13:59,508
Where's Kwang Soo?

434
00:13:59,509 --> 00:14:00,814
(By the way...)

435
00:14:01,810 --> 00:14:03,179
(Kwang Soo has disappeared.)

436
00:14:03,180 --> 00:14:04,838
Keep an eye on him.

437
00:14:04,839 --> 00:14:05,985
Where is he?

438
00:14:06,079 --> 00:14:07,378
Kwang Soo.

439
00:14:07,379 --> 00:14:08,549
(Where did he go?)

440
00:14:08,550 --> 00:14:09,819
Where is he?

441
00:14:09,820 --> 00:14:11,025
Hold on.

442
00:14:11,420 --> 00:14:13,424
(Is he upstairs?)

443
00:14:15,190 --> 00:14:16,789
- Kwang Soo, what are you doing? - Yes?

444
00:14:16,790 --> 00:14:19,164
(They find him at the terrace.)

445
00:14:19,729 --> 00:14:21,164
I was just looking around.

446
00:14:22,089 --> 00:14:24,975
(Why was he upstairs alone?)

447
00:14:25,229 --> 00:14:29,005
- I was just looking around. - Guys.

448
00:14:29,070 --> 00:14:30,399
- Hey, you're the bio-terrorist. - Come here.

449
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:32,039
- It's not me. - You're the virus.

450
00:14:32,040 --> 00:14:33,368
It's not me.

451
00:14:33,369 --> 00:14:36,069
- He's acting strange. - What is it?

452
00:14:36,070 --> 00:14:38,554
There was a camera with him.

453
00:14:38,640 --> 00:14:40,309
He was wandering around.

454
00:14:40,310 --> 00:14:42,954
- He probably has a mission. - I think he was marking things.

455
00:14:43,079 --> 00:14:44,748
It's nothing suspicious.

456
00:14:44,749 --> 00:14:46,049
I was just looking around.

457
00:14:46,050 --> 00:14:47,289
- He's Kwang Virus. - He's Kwang Virus.

458
00:14:47,290 --> 00:14:49,659
- You're related to it. - What do you mean?

459
00:14:49,660 --> 00:14:50,735
What did you do upstairs?

460
00:14:50,790 --> 00:14:52,488
I was just looking around. There was stuff up there?

461
00:14:52,489 --> 00:14:53,659
Why would you go up there?

462
00:14:53,660 --> 00:14:54,804
Just in case.

463
00:14:55,459 --> 00:14:57,934
(Is he being suspicious because he's the bio-terrorist?)

464
00:14:58,359 --> 00:15:00,199
The mission starts now, right?

465
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:01,228
You'll be infected the moment you laugh.

466
00:15:01,229 --> 00:15:02,475
That's easy.

467
00:15:02,700 --> 00:15:05,115
I'm confident.

468
00:15:06,410 --> 00:15:08,515
This is too easy.

469
00:15:08,869 --> 00:15:11,008
"Route Four".

470
00:15:11,009 --> 00:15:13,184
The routes are here. Here's Route One.

471
00:15:13,780 --> 00:15:15,208
Okay, Route One.

472
00:15:15,209 --> 00:15:16,554
(He finds his route.)

473
00:15:16,920 --> 00:15:19,118
(Why are they telling me not to laugh?)

474
00:15:19,119 --> 00:15:20,824
Don't laugh.

475
00:15:21,719 --> 00:15:23,419
- No way! - Please give me your autograph.

476
00:15:23,420 --> 00:15:24,694
Sure.

477
00:15:25,259 --> 00:15:27,904
(No way! Please give me your autograph.)

478
00:15:27,959 --> 00:15:29,128
- Sure. - Hold on.

479
00:15:29,129 --> 00:15:30,529
- I'm sorry. - Can we take a photo?

480
00:15:30,530 --> 00:15:31,958
- Sure. - One time.

481
00:15:31,959 --> 00:15:33,769
- Han Byul, come here. - Hurry up.

482
00:15:33,770 --> 00:15:35,669
- I can't smile or laugh. - Really?

483
00:15:35,670 --> 00:15:38,574
- Hello! - Hello.

484
00:15:38,869 --> 00:15:39,939
Hello!

485
00:15:39,940 --> 00:15:41,468
(Han Byul arrives.)

486
00:15:41,469 --> 00:15:45,184
(She has nose hair.)

487
00:15:45,910 --> 00:15:48,525
(Hello, I'm Han Byul.)

488
00:15:48,910 --> 00:15:50,649
(She arrives while boasting her long nose hair.)

489
00:15:50,650 --> 00:15:52,154
Please take a photo with me.

490
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:54,694
(They lock eyes, and he's in a crisis.)

491
00:15:54,920 --> 00:15:58,488
Hold on. I need to tidy up my nose hair.

492
00:15:58,489 --> 00:15:59,988
How do I look? Am I pretty?

493
00:15:59,989 --> 00:16:01,858
- Please look at me. - You're pretty.

494
00:16:01,859 --> 00:16:03,029
Really?

495
00:16:03,030 --> 00:16:04,735
- You're pretty. - He said I'm pretty.

496
00:16:04,829 --> 00:16:06,429
Let's take a photo.

497
00:16:06,430 --> 00:16:07,429
Excuse me.

498
00:16:07,430 --> 00:16:10,275
Come on, let's take a photo.

499
00:16:10,940 --> 00:16:12,944
1, 2, 3.

500
00:16:13,609 --> 00:16:15,544
(He's trying hard not to laugh.)

501
00:16:15,640 --> 00:16:17,779
- Okay, goodbye. - You're so handsome!

502
00:16:17,780 --> 00:16:19,108
I hear that often.

503
00:16:19,109 --> 00:16:20,549
(He leaves them.)

504
00:16:20,550 --> 00:16:21,684
My gosh.

505
00:16:21,810 --> 00:16:23,595
I almost laughed there.

506
00:16:24,379 --> 00:16:26,225
That was crazy.

507
00:16:26,520 --> 00:16:27,848
I barely held it in.

508
00:16:27,849 --> 00:16:29,525
I get it now.

509
00:16:29,759 --> 00:16:31,694
I was startled.

510
00:16:32,890 --> 00:16:35,304
(He purses his lips and gets ready.)

511
00:16:36,300 --> 00:16:38,434
(But he spots something.)

512
00:16:39,400 --> 00:16:41,799
(He spots someone making fish-shaped buns.)

513
00:16:41,800 --> 00:16:43,639
Have some fish-shaped buns.

514
00:16:43,640 --> 00:16:45,975
(It's lady Yondu.)

515
00:16:47,070 --> 00:16:48,238
(She's a strong match.)

516
00:16:48,239 --> 00:16:49,338
Have some.

517
00:16:49,339 --> 00:16:52,015
I have red beans and choux cream.

518
00:16:52,140 --> 00:16:54,684
Please try some.

519
00:16:55,009 --> 00:16:56,248
Which one would you like?

520
00:16:56,249 --> 00:16:58,578
Which flavor would you like?

521
00:16:58,579 --> 00:16:59,794
Which one?

522
00:17:00,219 --> 00:17:02,324
Which one do you want?

523
00:17:02,989 --> 00:17:05,034
What? Which one?

524
00:17:05,290 --> 00:17:07,465
Come on. Pick one.

525
00:17:08,290 --> 00:17:09,874
Which one do you want?

526
00:17:10,600 --> 00:17:11,798
Which one?

527
00:17:11,799 --> 00:17:13,629
- Which one? - I want both.

528
00:17:13,630 --> 00:17:15,429
(He bursts into laughter.)

529
00:17:15,430 --> 00:17:16,745
You fail.

530
00:17:16,940 --> 00:17:18,369
- You laughed. - I want both.

531
00:17:18,370 --> 00:17:20,238
(He fails in stage 2.)

532
00:17:20,239 --> 00:17:21,784
Are you a lady?

533
00:17:21,870 --> 00:17:23,854
- Yes. - Are you female?

534
00:17:23,979 --> 00:17:26,008
- You are? - Yes, I am.

535
00:17:26,009 --> 00:17:28,778
(It's too funny that his legs become weary.)

536
00:17:28,779 --> 00:17:31,824
I'm a female, and I'm like this. What should I do?

537
00:17:32,180 --> 00:17:33,788
You look so hilarious.

538
00:17:33,789 --> 00:17:36,064
(She's just as funny-looking as So Min.)

539
00:17:36,190 --> 00:17:37,564
My gosh.

540
00:17:37,660 --> 00:17:39,258
You are infected.

541
00:17:39,259 --> 00:17:40,458
What are you doing?

542
00:17:40,459 --> 00:17:42,558
- You get your face drawn on. - Look up.

543
00:17:42,559 --> 00:17:46,104
(Seok Jin is infected by the virus.)

544
00:17:46,670 --> 00:17:49,715
(The others don't know.)

545
00:17:49,969 --> 00:17:51,715
Do you want to have a quiz competition?

546
00:17:52,140 --> 00:17:54,485
1-on-1? Kwang Soo should play too.

547
00:17:54,709 --> 00:17:56,268
- No. - You should play.

548
00:17:56,269 --> 00:17:57,339
Don't include me.

549
00:17:57,340 --> 00:18:00,208
Not you. You should beat him first.

550
00:18:00,209 --> 00:18:02,609
For the indoor game,

551
00:18:02,610 --> 00:18:04,449
- Let's do a quiz. - we'll play this quiz.

552
00:18:04,450 --> 00:18:06,218
And Ji Hyo should...

553
00:18:06,219 --> 00:18:08,564
- also participate. - You're right.

554
00:18:08,590 --> 00:18:10,558
- You should show them. - You should.

555
00:18:10,559 --> 00:18:13,089
Show us how stupid you are.

556
00:18:13,090 --> 00:18:15,235
A member from the losing team will go outside.

557
00:18:15,259 --> 00:18:16,359
All right.

558
00:18:16,360 --> 00:18:19,235
What is taking Seok Jin so long?

559
00:18:19,459 --> 00:18:21,968
- Maybe... - No, we made the right choice.

560
00:18:21,969 --> 00:18:24,238
- Yes. - We thought a lot about this.

561
00:18:24,239 --> 00:18:26,508
His eyebrows will be drawn.

562
00:18:26,509 --> 00:18:29,639
If he comes back with nothing,

563
00:18:29,640 --> 00:18:31,579
I won't think he's passed.

564
00:18:31,580 --> 00:18:32,939
You think he'll be infected?

565
00:18:32,940 --> 00:18:35,208
I'd think he was the bio-terrorist.

566
00:18:35,209 --> 00:18:36,518
(He'll suspect him as the bio-terrorist.)

567
00:18:36,519 --> 00:18:38,354
(But he's not.)

568
00:18:39,080 --> 00:18:40,818
(Suddenly...)

569
00:18:40,819 --> 00:18:42,389
I can't believe this.

570
00:18:42,390 --> 00:18:43,665
(He suddenly acts like a zombie when no one asked him to.)

571
00:18:43,959 --> 00:18:46,804
(He's too into it.)

572
00:18:47,190 --> 00:18:50,028
(Due to the actor being immersed in it, we won't use CG.)

573
00:18:50,029 --> 00:18:51,874
I'll infect everyone else.

574
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:54,445
I'll infect everyone else.

575
00:18:56,499 --> 00:18:59,169
- He's here. He's a zombie. - He's here?

576
00:18:59,170 --> 00:19:00,308
- He's here? - Did he not buy anything?

577
00:19:00,309 --> 00:19:01,808
- He's infected. - Look carefully.

578
00:19:01,809 --> 00:19:03,015
- He didn't buy anything. - Seok Jin.

579
00:19:05,209 --> 00:19:07,679
(The zombie is back.)

580
00:19:07,680 --> 00:19:09,185
- My gosh. - No way.

581
00:19:10,920 --> 00:19:12,149
(He's horrible at acting.)

582
00:19:12,150 --> 00:19:13,718
- Look at him acting. - What is this?

583
00:19:13,719 --> 00:19:14,748
Seok Jin.

584
00:19:14,749 --> 00:19:16,689
- What is that? - Look under his eyes.

585
00:19:16,690 --> 00:19:18,034
What is that?

586
00:19:18,759 --> 00:19:20,389
- What is that? - What's going on?

587
00:19:20,390 --> 00:19:21,804
What's wrong with your eyes?

588
00:19:22,360 --> 00:19:24,228
(He runs towards Kwang Soo.)

589
00:19:24,229 --> 00:19:26,498
Rip off his name tag and make him stay still for five minutes.

590
00:19:26,499 --> 00:19:27,528
What happens now?

591
00:19:27,529 --> 00:19:29,745
(His name tag is torn off.)

592
00:19:30,039 --> 00:19:31,468
He needs to stand by a wall for five minutes.

593
00:19:31,469 --> 00:19:32,738
You need to.

594
00:19:32,739 --> 00:19:34,038
- I'm sorry. - He's not it.

595
00:19:34,039 --> 00:19:36,185
You should've told us.

596
00:19:36,370 --> 00:19:38,508
He loves being in the center of attention.

597
00:19:38,509 --> 00:19:39,538
My gosh.

598
00:19:39,539 --> 00:19:41,849
Did you not buy anything?

599
00:19:41,850 --> 00:19:43,248
(He's still into his character.)

600
00:19:43,249 --> 00:19:45,394
You can talk.

601
00:19:45,950 --> 00:19:47,748
- I couldn't. - What?

602
00:19:47,749 --> 00:19:49,958
What happened?

603
00:19:49,959 --> 00:19:51,235
You should find out for yourself.

604
00:19:51,519 --> 00:19:53,058
- What happened? - You should go yourself.

605
00:19:53,059 --> 00:19:54,089
(He's confident that Jae Seok will fail as well.)

606
00:19:54,090 --> 00:19:55,159
- He couldn't buy anything. - This is driving me crazy.

607
00:19:55,160 --> 00:19:57,334
Does that mean we can't eat anything?

608
00:19:57,360 --> 00:19:58,958
Do I have to stand still for the entire day?

609
00:19:58,959 --> 00:20:00,468
- It's for 5 minutes. - Just for 5 minutes.

610
00:20:00,469 --> 00:20:01,669
Five minutes?

611
00:20:01,670 --> 00:20:04,745
You don't have to grunt like a zombie.

612
00:20:04,799 --> 00:20:06,669
- What? I'm going to. - You don't need to.

613
00:20:06,670 --> 00:20:08,768
- What do you mean? - Don't sulk.

614
00:20:08,769 --> 00:20:10,778
- We'll see how long you'll do it. - I'm going to act like a zombie.

615
00:20:10,779 --> 00:20:11,879
Let's see how long you'll do it for.

616
00:20:11,880 --> 00:20:14,079
Your acting is so awkward.

617
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:15,109
I'll do it from time to time.

618
00:20:15,110 --> 00:20:16,649
- Sure, do that. - I will.

619
00:20:16,650 --> 00:20:18,278
- Fine. - Fine, I'll do that.

620
00:20:18,279 --> 00:20:19,889
My gosh.

621
00:20:19,890 --> 00:20:22,089
This was useless.

622
00:20:22,090 --> 00:20:23,089
Who's next?

623
00:20:23,090 --> 00:20:26,034
For the stir-fried rice, we need eggs and ham.

624
00:20:26,420 --> 00:20:27,589
(The rice is ready.)

625
00:20:27,590 --> 00:20:28,788
The rice is ready.

626
00:20:28,789 --> 00:20:30,329
- One person should go. - Do rock-paper-scissors.

627
00:20:30,330 --> 00:20:31,498
- Jae Seok. - Do rock-paper-scissors.

628
00:20:31,499 --> 00:20:32,899
(Ripping)

629
00:20:32,900 --> 00:20:33,998
- Jae Seok. - Do rock-paper-scissors.

630
00:20:33,999 --> 00:20:36,028
(Seok Jin tries to rip his name tag.)

631
00:20:36,029 --> 00:20:37,238
You must've gone insane!

632
00:20:37,239 --> 00:20:38,768
Don't do that!

633
00:20:38,769 --> 00:20:40,738
(He barely saves himself.)

634
00:20:40,739 --> 00:20:42,185
Hey, you...

635
00:20:43,340 --> 00:20:44,715
Stand there.

636
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:46,038
This is upsetting.

637
00:20:46,039 --> 00:20:48,278
- This sure is. - Stay still.

638
00:20:48,279 --> 00:20:49,624
How dare you try to rip off my name tag?

639
00:20:49,749 --> 00:20:51,495
You were in front of me.

640
00:20:51,650 --> 00:20:53,849
I'll set the timer...

641
00:20:53,850 --> 00:20:55,465
and rip it off every five minutes.

642
00:20:55,850 --> 00:20:57,419
(They plan to make it endless.)

643
00:20:57,420 --> 00:20:58,458
You're right.

644
00:20:58,459 --> 00:21:00,488
(I'm going to do that.)

645
00:21:00,489 --> 00:21:03,304
(He sets the timer for 5 minutes.)

646
00:21:03,959 --> 00:21:05,359
Who should go?

647
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:06,728
I pick Jae Seok.

648
00:21:06,729 --> 00:21:09,329
Jae Seok is overall good at missions.

649
00:21:09,330 --> 00:21:11,238
- You're right. - Should I go, then?

650
00:21:11,239 --> 00:21:12,998
But if I get infected...

651
00:21:12,999 --> 00:21:16,538
If you pick the same route as I did, you'll get infected for sure.

652
00:21:16,539 --> 00:21:17,579
What about me?

653
00:21:17,580 --> 00:21:19,185
For you,

654
00:21:19,209 --> 00:21:20,548
you'll have a 30-percent chance.

655
00:21:20,549 --> 00:21:21,808
- You should go. - You should

656
00:21:21,809 --> 00:21:23,679
- Go. - You should go.

657
00:21:23,680 --> 00:21:25,949
If another person gets infected, it will put us at a disadvantage.

658
00:21:25,950 --> 00:21:28,649
I don't suspect you because he said you had a 30-percent chance.

659
00:21:28,650 --> 00:21:30,564
So you might succeed.

660
00:21:31,920 --> 00:21:35,189
(He goes for Jae Seok's name tag once again.)

661
00:21:35,190 --> 00:21:38,104
My gosh, you startled me!

662
00:21:38,660 --> 00:21:39,945
(Kwang Soo rips his name tag once again.)

663
00:21:40,330 --> 00:21:42,699
(He gets punished.)

664
00:21:42,700 --> 00:21:43,798
(He spanks him.)

665
00:21:43,799 --> 00:21:45,899
- I just... - My gosh!

666
00:21:45,900 --> 00:21:48,114
I just did it without realizing it.

667
00:21:48,140 --> 00:21:50,284
I can't help it.

668
00:21:50,440 --> 00:21:52,314
He surprised me!

669
00:21:52,539 --> 00:21:54,649
- Yours almost came off. - I know! Put it back on!

670
00:21:54,650 --> 00:21:55,708
Make sure it's on well.

671
00:21:55,709 --> 00:21:57,394
- Should I go? - Yes.

672
00:21:58,350 --> 00:21:59,579
- Se Chan. - Yes?

673
00:21:59,580 --> 00:22:01,518
- Succeed and buy ramyeon. - Buy...

674
00:22:01,519 --> 00:22:02,548
- delicious ones. - Got it.

675
00:22:02,549 --> 00:22:03,818
- I'll buy ramyeon. - And ice cream.

676
00:22:03,819 --> 00:22:05,258
- I know what to buy. - Cooking oil.

677
00:22:05,259 --> 00:22:07,205
- Eggs. - Eggs. Don't worry.

678
00:22:07,529 --> 00:22:08,889
(He sets out.)

679
00:22:08,890 --> 00:22:10,735
I must succeed.

680
00:22:10,799 --> 00:22:13,528
- What is that? - Since Seok Jin chose Route One,

681
00:22:13,529 --> 00:22:16,304
you'll go with the same one. It's simple.

682
00:22:17,039 --> 00:22:18,339
You must not laugh.

683
00:22:18,340 --> 00:22:19,675
- I shouldn't laugh? - No.

684
00:22:19,769 --> 00:22:21,114
Isn't that too easy?

685
00:22:21,340 --> 00:22:22,409
Let's go.

686
00:22:22,410 --> 00:22:23,755
That's so simple.

687
00:22:24,910 --> 00:22:27,784
It's easy for me not to laugh.

688
00:22:28,450 --> 00:22:30,655
Will someone touch me?

689
00:22:32,749 --> 00:22:34,189
The rice looks good.

690
00:22:34,190 --> 00:22:37,058
- It's already done? - It smells nice.

691
00:22:37,059 --> 00:22:38,089
- You can't eat it. - Seok Jin.

692
00:22:38,090 --> 00:22:39,929
- You don't have an appetite. - You don't have an appetite.

693
00:22:39,930 --> 00:22:41,364
- I don't? - That's right.

694
00:22:41,459 --> 00:22:43,189
Let me keep my appetite.

695
00:22:43,190 --> 00:22:45,775
You're not supposed to. That's where the name comes from.

696
00:22:46,229 --> 00:22:47,669
You're not supposed to have emotions or an appetite.

697
00:22:47,670 --> 00:22:49,399
- You're back to factory settings. - Virus, virus.

698
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:50,869
You're not supposed to have emotions or an appetite.

699
00:22:50,870 --> 00:22:53,175
(Virus, virus)

700
00:22:54,039 --> 00:22:55,869
(Seok Jin suddenly starts murmuring something.)

701
00:22:55,870 --> 00:22:57,038
Virus, virus.

702
00:22:57,039 --> 00:22:58,854
(What's going on?)

703
00:22:59,080 --> 00:23:02,649
If you repeat the word "virus" to the bio-terrorist,

704
00:23:02,650 --> 00:23:05,425
the bio-terrorist will reply by saying "vinegar".

705
00:23:06,549 --> 00:23:08,748
(The infected must work with the terrorist...)

706
00:23:08,749 --> 00:23:11,034
(to infect as many people as they can.)

707
00:23:12,019 --> 00:23:15,089
(Seok Jin is checking to see if Jong Kook is the terrorist.)

708
00:23:15,090 --> 00:23:16,798
(Is Jong Kook the bio-terrorist?)

709
00:23:16,799 --> 00:23:18,134
Virus, virus.

710
00:23:18,860 --> 00:23:21,644
(Jong Kook only repeated what Seok Jin said.)

711
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:23,939
Do you want some rice?

712
00:23:23,940 --> 00:23:25,568
- Just warm it up... - So Min,

713
00:23:25,569 --> 00:23:27,609
- I think it's Jae Seok. - It's too dry.

714
00:23:27,610 --> 00:23:29,415
- Why? - It's a hunch.

715
00:23:29,709 --> 00:23:32,909
Well, you suspecting him seems suspicious to me.

716
00:23:32,910 --> 00:23:34,978
Even your sunglasses are suspicious.

717
00:23:34,979 --> 00:23:37,379
Seriously? Haven't I played the villain enough?

718
00:23:37,380 --> 00:23:39,594
Also, viruses are small.

719
00:23:40,590 --> 00:23:43,359
Wait, that's actually a big clue.

720
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:44,488
Viruses are small.

721
00:23:44,489 --> 00:23:45,788
That means it's Jae Seok.

722
00:23:45,789 --> 00:23:47,228
(Jae Seok's the small one.)

723
00:23:47,229 --> 00:23:48,659
(Running Man's official Mr. Tiny?)

724
00:23:48,660 --> 00:23:50,435
Is it Jae Seok or Haha?

725
00:23:50,799 --> 00:23:52,099
Jae Seok, of course.

726
00:23:52,100 --> 00:23:53,905
He made me a man.

727
00:23:54,370 --> 00:23:56,028
Everyone in Mapo-gu knows about him.

728
00:23:56,029 --> 00:23:57,314
(Everyone in Mapo-gu knows about him.)

729
00:23:57,499 --> 00:23:59,675
I'm the least jealous of Jae Seok when it comes to my neighbors.

730
00:24:00,509 --> 00:24:01,945
Right?

731
00:24:02,370 --> 00:24:03,909
I'm not kidding about the rumors.

732
00:24:03,910 --> 00:24:05,584
(I want to laugh with them too.)

733
00:24:06,410 --> 00:24:07,909
Hold on a second. You can't laugh.

734
00:24:07,910 --> 00:24:09,278
- Wait. - You can't laugh.

735
00:24:09,279 --> 00:24:10,879
- You shouldn't laugh. - Don't laugh!

736
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:13,119
- But it's funny. - You should be emotionless.

737
00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:14,718
It's been five minutes, so join us.

738
00:24:14,719 --> 00:24:16,919
Stop biting our name tags though.

739
00:24:16,920 --> 00:24:18,195
I won't.

740
00:24:18,219 --> 00:24:20,189
This is too easy though.

741
00:24:20,190 --> 00:24:21,364
(The younger comedian is confident about his mission.)

742
00:24:24,029 --> 00:24:27,445
- Can we get your autograph? - We love you so much.

743
00:24:27,469 --> 00:24:30,675
(The girls come from the alley like before.)

744
00:24:31,940 --> 00:24:34,215
(He's figuring out what's going on.)

745
00:24:34,610 --> 00:24:36,208
Hold on. Han Byul, come on.

746
00:24:36,209 --> 00:24:37,409
Can our friend get one too?

747
00:24:37,410 --> 00:24:38,814
- Sure. - Han Byul, come on.

748
00:24:39,239 --> 00:24:41,025
I get it now.

749
00:24:43,650 --> 00:24:45,624
- All right. - I get it now.

750
00:24:45,779 --> 00:24:46,864
Why?

751
00:24:47,690 --> 00:24:49,988
(Did someone call for Han Byul?)

752
00:24:49,989 --> 00:24:51,364
(He turns away.)

753
00:24:51,789 --> 00:24:53,288
(Han Byul runs over with her nose hair flying.)

754
00:24:53,289 --> 00:24:54,359
Come on.

755
00:24:54,360 --> 00:24:57,359
Hello, I'm a huge fan of yours.

756
00:24:57,360 --> 00:24:58,958
- My gosh. - It's nice to meet you.

757
00:24:58,959 --> 00:25:00,199
- No way. - It's a pleasure.

758
00:25:00,200 --> 00:25:01,498
Can we take a photo?

759
00:25:01,499 --> 00:25:02,975
- Yes, of course. - Awesome.

760
00:25:03,100 --> 00:25:05,238
Hold on a second. Let's put this side up.

761
00:25:05,239 --> 00:25:07,038
No, she looks prettier with it left down.

762
00:25:07,039 --> 00:25:08,238
Hold on.

763
00:25:08,239 --> 00:25:09,409
(They attack him by tucking her nose hair.)

764
00:25:09,410 --> 00:25:10,978
(2nd critical moment)

765
00:25:10,979 --> 00:25:12,879
(The staff snorts.)

766
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:14,455
(Laughing)

767
00:25:14,580 --> 00:25:16,978
- You're more handsome in person. - Really?

768
00:25:16,979 --> 00:25:19,179
- Goodness. - You're pretty too.

769
00:25:19,180 --> 00:25:20,218
- Really? - Really?

770
00:25:20,219 --> 00:25:21,919
- Yes. - What if I got a perm?

771
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:23,919
- A perm? Sounds good. - Right?

772
00:25:23,920 --> 00:25:26,829
You'll look even prettier if they came down the middle.

773
00:25:26,830 --> 00:25:27,935
Exactly.

774
00:25:29,229 --> 00:25:30,758
(Ms. Nose Hair, be a comedian someday.)

775
00:25:30,759 --> 00:25:32,359
Thanks, guys.

776
00:25:32,360 --> 00:25:34,099
- Good luck. - Thanks.

777
00:25:34,100 --> 00:25:35,798
Thank you so much.

778
00:25:35,799 --> 00:25:37,074
No way.

779
00:25:37,100 --> 00:25:39,099
(That was close.)

780
00:25:39,100 --> 00:25:40,784
Did Seok Jin laugh at the sight of her?

781
00:25:41,309 --> 00:25:42,685
I can't tell you.

782
00:25:44,479 --> 00:25:45,854
That was stage one?

783
00:25:47,080 --> 00:25:48,554
Think sad thoughts.

784
00:25:49,049 --> 00:25:51,294
(He collects himself before reaching stage 2.)

785
00:25:54,219 --> 00:25:56,265
(Inhaling)

786
00:25:57,360 --> 00:25:59,458
Have a fish-shaped bun.

787
00:25:59,459 --> 00:26:00,935
(A fish-shaped bun sold by Yondu?)

788
00:26:01,489 --> 00:26:03,735
There's red bean flavor and choux cream flavor.

789
00:26:04,059 --> 00:26:06,458
(I must not laugh.)

790
00:26:06,459 --> 00:26:07,498
- Please try one. - Okay.

791
00:26:07,499 --> 00:26:09,644
- It's really good. - I see.

792
00:26:10,140 --> 00:26:11,445
How is it?

793
00:26:11,900 --> 00:26:13,745
- It's good. - Is it?

794
00:26:14,239 --> 00:26:16,044
- This must not be easy. - Right.

795
00:26:17,009 --> 00:26:20,579
(It's best not to look at her.)

796
00:26:20,580 --> 00:26:23,818
(She's wearing all that makeup in this hot weather.)

797
00:26:23,819 --> 00:26:25,925
Taking off the makeup is actually harder.

798
00:26:26,420 --> 00:26:27,718
(She relates to his words and lets her guard down.)

799
00:26:27,719 --> 00:26:28,849
- I'm not kidding. - I know.

800
00:26:28,850 --> 00:26:30,788
- I wish you a good day then. - Oh, no.

801
00:26:30,789 --> 00:26:31,818
(You too.)

802
00:26:31,819 --> 00:26:32,859
May I keep going then?

803
00:26:32,860 --> 00:26:35,389
(Se Chan relates to the lady and passes without laughing.)

804
00:26:35,390 --> 00:26:37,804
Unbelievable. You guys are unbelievable.

805
00:26:38,029 --> 00:26:40,768
(He carries onto the convenience store.)

806
00:26:40,769 --> 00:26:42,129
They all seem like hired actors.

807
00:26:42,130 --> 00:26:43,205
(He keeps his guard up.)

809
00:26:47,469 --> 00:26:48,814
Hello.

810
00:26:51,209 --> 00:26:54,278
(A random lady is standing in the alley.)

811
00:26:54,279 --> 00:26:55,748
- I'm a fan. - Thank you.

812
00:26:55,749 --> 00:26:57,894
- Can we take a photo? - Sure.

813
00:26:57,950 --> 00:26:59,425
(He's about to take a photo with the lady.)

814
00:27:00,049 --> 00:27:01,089
Here we go.

815
00:27:01,090 --> 00:27:02,089
- I got it. - Thank you.

816
00:27:02,090 --> 00:27:06,488
- Where did you get this phone? - This?

817
00:27:06,489 --> 00:27:07,829
(She winds up.)

818
00:27:07,830 --> 00:27:09,958
(The phone is kicked away.)

819
00:27:09,959 --> 00:27:12,199
(After kicking the phone away)

820
00:27:12,200 --> 00:27:13,874
(Yippee!)

821
00:27:14,430 --> 00:27:16,199
(What?)

822
00:27:16,200 --> 00:27:17,939
(Yippee!)

823
00:27:17,940 --> 00:27:19,044
(Yippee!)

824
00:27:20,039 --> 00:27:24,284
(The staff bursts out laughing at the sight of her cartwheels.)

825
00:27:24,680 --> 00:27:27,255
(See you!)

826
00:27:27,549 --> 00:27:29,978
(He's close to laughing.)

827
00:27:29,979 --> 00:27:31,824
(Get a grip on yourself.)

828
00:27:31,920 --> 00:27:34,824
(The cartwheels almost sent him over the edge.)

829
00:27:35,850 --> 00:27:37,735
Everyone will probably laugh at this.

830
00:27:38,120 --> 00:27:39,488
I almost laughed too.

831
00:27:39,489 --> 00:27:40,564
(Stage 3 almost got me.)

832
00:27:40,789 --> 00:27:42,389
She just kicked the phone.

833
00:27:42,390 --> 00:27:44,074
It's one that actually works though.

834
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:47,298
I'm finally here.

835
00:27:47,299 --> 00:27:49,498
(All he has to do is buy the ingredients.)

836
00:27:49,499 --> 00:27:52,199
- Judging by how late he is... - He must've succeeded.

837
00:27:52,200 --> 00:27:53,298
He might succeed.

838
00:27:53,299 --> 00:27:54,745
Or he could be the bio-terrorist.

839
00:27:55,039 --> 00:27:58,609
Isn't it about time that Ji Hyo was the villain?

840
00:27:58,610 --> 00:28:00,478
- It's not me. - There must be a reason...

841
00:28:00,479 --> 00:28:01,854
why you're so quiet today.

842
00:28:02,009 --> 00:28:03,278
A bad day?

843
00:28:03,279 --> 00:28:04,849
Is it something personal?

844
00:28:04,850 --> 00:28:07,818
Are you burdened by the upcoming quiz?

845
00:28:07,819 --> 00:28:09,818
(Are you burdened by the upcoming quiz?)

846
00:28:09,819 --> 00:28:11,958
- No. - It won't be you.

847
00:28:11,959 --> 00:28:13,394
You don't have to do it.

848
00:28:13,660 --> 00:28:15,929
- You don't have to. - Is it really the quiz?

849
00:28:15,930 --> 00:28:18,005
(Just then)

850
00:28:18,959 --> 00:28:20,745
(Ripping)

851
00:28:21,729 --> 00:28:24,339
(Zombie Seok Jin rips So Min's name tag off.)

852
00:28:24,340 --> 00:28:26,869
(If your name tag is ripped off, it means you've been infected.)

853
00:28:26,870 --> 00:28:28,084
This fast?

854
00:28:29,670 --> 00:28:30,978
(Ripping)

855
00:28:30,979 --> 00:28:32,978
- Seriously? - That was so out of the blue.

856
00:28:32,979 --> 00:28:34,324
It felt so random.

857
00:28:34,950 --> 00:28:36,854
I shouldn't have sat next to him.

858
00:28:37,380 --> 00:28:39,525
I think it would've been wiser to keep So Min uninfected.

859
00:28:40,489 --> 00:28:43,548
That was really fast though.

860
00:28:43,549 --> 00:28:44,958
- What's with her? - My gosh.

861
00:28:44,959 --> 00:28:46,765
What does she have on her cheeks?

862
00:28:47,130 --> 00:28:48,129
What's that?

863
00:28:48,130 --> 00:28:49,129
(An infected zombie enters.)

864
00:28:49,130 --> 00:28:51,298
That's not how zombies are.

865
00:28:51,299 --> 00:28:52,505
I'm dizzy.

866
00:28:52,559 --> 00:28:55,205
Oh, dear.

867
00:28:55,400 --> 00:28:57,238
- "REA Virus" is written on her. - What?

868
00:28:57,239 --> 00:28:58,238
(Wait!)

869
00:28:58,239 --> 00:29:01,139
(Why is "REA Virus" written on her cheek?)

870
00:29:01,140 --> 00:29:02,409
(Is she the bio-terrorist?)

871
00:29:02,410 --> 00:29:03,839
- What's this? - What's going on?

872
00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:05,609
She wrote it herself. That's why it's reversed.

873
00:29:05,610 --> 00:29:08,079
Friend. Family.

874
00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:10,354
Dad.

875
00:29:11,049 --> 00:29:12,255
No.

876
00:29:12,549 --> 00:29:14,018
She's drawing a line.

877
00:29:14,019 --> 00:29:15,748
- What? - She's drawing the line.

878
00:29:15,749 --> 00:29:17,834
- Dad. - No.

879
00:29:17,860 --> 00:29:20,189
- I'm not your dad. - Wait...

880
00:29:20,190 --> 00:29:21,228
I'm finally here.

881
00:29:21,229 --> 00:29:23,435
(Meanwhile, Se Chan's almost at the convenience store.)

882
00:29:24,200 --> 00:29:26,074
(However)

883
00:29:28,100 --> 00:29:31,839
(A suspicious man is standing in front of it.)

884
00:29:31,840 --> 00:29:33,985
You will receive money to complete this mission first.

885
00:29:34,670 --> 00:29:35,745
From him?

886
00:29:36,440 --> 00:29:38,755
Here's your money.

887
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:39,879
(He takes his glasses off.)

888
00:29:39,880 --> 00:29:42,255
(Another pair is drawn on his face.)

889
00:29:42,709 --> 00:29:43,949
(The glasses almost made him laugh.)

890
00:29:43,950 --> 00:29:46,124
Here you go.

891
00:29:46,279 --> 00:29:47,349
Hold on a second.

892
00:29:47,350 --> 00:29:48,465
(He takes off his cap.)

893
00:29:48,920 --> 00:29:50,564
(He's bald!)

894
00:29:50,819 --> 00:29:51,919
(Se Chan almost laughed.)

895
00:29:51,920 --> 00:29:54,728
Here you go. And now...

896
00:29:54,729 --> 00:29:56,089
(Hold it back a little more.)

897
00:29:56,090 --> 00:29:57,374
(Snorting)

898
00:29:58,299 --> 00:30:00,074
(He's close to bursting into laughter.)

899
00:30:00,630 --> 00:30:02,775
(He seemed normal on the outside.)

900
00:30:02,799 --> 00:30:05,099
(But he has a face of an angel.)

901
00:30:05,100 --> 00:30:07,669
(Se Chan had no idea the director was this sweet.)

902
00:30:07,670 --> 00:30:09,609
(His angelic face...)

903
00:30:09,610 --> 00:30:11,738
(makes Se Chan lower his guard.)

904
00:30:11,739 --> 00:30:13,879
(Laughing)

905
00:30:13,880 --> 00:30:15,784
(He rolls on the ground.)

906
00:30:16,110 --> 00:30:18,054
(The comedian gives up.)

907
00:30:18,350 --> 00:30:21,364
(He shows his gums which is like a white flag.)

908
00:30:21,519 --> 00:30:23,465
Did you have to go this far?

909
00:30:24,390 --> 00:30:26,558
(You people...)

910
00:30:26,559 --> 00:30:30,064
(Do your parents know that you're working this hard to earn a living?)

911
00:30:31,400 --> 00:30:33,435
What on earth is this?

912
00:30:34,499 --> 00:30:37,215
(It's for the second time, but he still laughs.)

913
00:30:38,170 --> 00:30:39,298
Seriously?

914
00:30:39,299 --> 00:30:40,298
(Se Chan fails at stage 4.)

915
00:30:40,299 --> 00:30:42,814
Se Chan, you've been infected.

916
00:30:43,009 --> 00:30:44,755
The baldness I could take,

917
00:30:44,940 --> 00:30:46,808
but that face...

918
00:30:46,809 --> 00:30:48,925
(Se Chan has been infected.)

919
00:30:48,950 --> 00:30:50,748
(Still, he gets to buy the ingredients.)

920
00:30:50,749 --> 00:30:51,949
Unbelievable.

921
00:30:51,950 --> 00:30:54,165
(He walks into the convenience store.)

922
00:30:56,190 --> 00:30:58,094
(He bursts into laughter.)

923
00:31:00,789 --> 00:31:03,089
(Laughing)

924
00:31:03,090 --> 00:31:05,435
(The staff is unbelievable.)

925
00:31:06,499 --> 00:31:08,568
(Laughing)

926
00:31:08,569 --> 00:31:10,675
(This I must film.)

927
00:31:11,640 --> 00:31:13,985
(Laughing hysterically)

928
00:31:15,009 --> 00:31:17,584
(He can't hold it back anymore.)

929
00:31:17,880 --> 00:31:19,839
Are you kidding me?

930
00:31:19,840 --> 00:31:21,079
(What is stage 5 of the Don't Laugh challenge?)

931
00:31:21,080 --> 00:31:22,449
- He's back. - Is he?

932
00:31:22,450 --> 00:31:23,579
He's here.

933
00:31:23,580 --> 00:31:25,218
- Did he buy the ingredients? - He did.

934
00:31:25,219 --> 00:31:26,425
He has the ingredients!

935
00:31:27,489 --> 00:31:28,824
- Nice. - Let's boil the water.

936
00:31:29,090 --> 00:31:30,218
Amazing.

937
00:31:30,219 --> 00:31:31,988
- Se Chan. - His face is clean.

938
00:31:31,989 --> 00:31:34,558
- Hold on. Him too. - He's infected!

939
00:31:34,559 --> 00:31:36,028
- Really? - He's infected.

940
00:31:36,029 --> 00:31:37,165
You're infected?

941
00:31:38,299 --> 00:31:39,498
(Se Chan has been infected.)

942
00:31:39,499 --> 00:31:40,604
What?

943
00:31:40,670 --> 00:31:42,869
- We're family. - Family.

944
00:31:42,870 --> 00:31:43,939
- Family. - There are three of them now.

945
00:31:43,940 --> 00:31:44,968
Why are you infected?

946
00:31:44,969 --> 00:31:46,314
(He bursts into laughter.)

947
00:31:46,969 --> 00:31:49,485
(He meets another family member who is also a weak link.)

948
00:31:50,410 --> 00:31:51,778
Why were you infected?

949
00:31:51,779 --> 00:31:53,778
Don't. No one should go.

950
00:31:53,779 --> 00:31:55,379
- What... - You won't believe...

951
00:31:55,380 --> 00:31:57,155
what they have in store for us.

952
00:31:57,219 --> 00:31:59,525
- He still bought these. - Right.

953
00:31:59,850 --> 00:32:01,165
Let's make them.

954
00:32:01,390 --> 00:32:03,488
- But... - Three zombies make it dangerous.

955
00:32:03,489 --> 00:32:05,265
We really are in danger.

956
00:32:05,989 --> 00:32:08,028
I survived until the final stage, but gosh.

957
00:32:08,029 --> 00:32:09,028
Is it that funny?

958
00:32:09,029 --> 00:32:10,634
You have no idea.

959
00:32:10,999 --> 00:32:12,298
No one can beat the final stage.

960
00:32:12,299 --> 00:32:14,205
It's been designed for us to fail.

961
00:32:15,469 --> 00:32:17,874
- It's fine. - Let me take them.

962
00:32:18,039 --> 00:32:19,599
- The rice... - No.

963
00:32:19,600 --> 00:32:21,284
- It was cooked perfectly. - Virus, virus.

964
00:32:22,469 --> 00:32:25,939
(So Min says "virus" to Haha.)

965
00:32:25,940 --> 00:32:27,455
Vinegar, vinegar.

966
00:32:28,080 --> 00:32:31,978
(Haha replied by saying "vinegar.")

967
00:32:31,979 --> 00:32:34,849
(Only the bio-terrorist knows the code.)

968
00:32:34,850 --> 00:32:38,165
(Is Haha the bio-terrorist then?)

969
00:32:39,620 --> 00:32:40,935
- Who do you think it is? - Not even water?

970
00:32:41,390 --> 00:32:42,965
Try saying "virus" to Dong Hoon.

971
00:32:42,989 --> 00:32:44,735
I did.

972
00:32:46,799 --> 00:32:48,199
(Haha came to Seok Jin while Se Chan was out.)

973
00:32:48,200 --> 00:32:50,498
You need to tell me.

974
00:32:50,499 --> 00:32:51,814
- Virus, virus. - What?

975
00:32:52,200 --> 00:32:54,308
- You need to tell me. - Virus, virus.

976
00:32:54,309 --> 00:32:56,344
(The code of the bio-terrorist, virus)

977
00:32:56,709 --> 00:32:57,814
Virus, virus.

978
00:32:59,410 --> 00:33:00,778
It's not him.

979
00:33:00,779 --> 00:33:02,748
- No, he said "vinegar' to me. - He did?

980
00:33:02,749 --> 00:33:03,925
(Haha said "virus", not "vinegar".)

981
00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:11,265
(Is Haha the bio-terrorist, or was it just a coincidence?)

982
00:33:12,360 --> 00:33:13,988
Look at this. I cooked it so well.

983
00:33:13,989 --> 00:33:15,064
Where?

984
00:33:15,660 --> 00:33:16,788
Gosh, look...

985
00:33:16,789 --> 00:33:18,604
Look at this.

986
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:21,369
(Quietly)

987
00:33:21,370 --> 00:33:22,445
Go away.

988
00:33:22,999 --> 00:33:24,874
Oh my gosh! I thought...

989
00:33:25,739 --> 00:33:26,998
Go away.

990
00:33:26,999 --> 00:33:28,738
I just want to watch.

991
00:33:28,739 --> 00:33:29,844
(Ripping)

992
00:33:30,709 --> 00:33:32,284
We need to start eating.

993
00:33:32,779 --> 00:33:34,525
- Go away. - He's right.

994
00:33:34,809 --> 00:33:36,849
Zombies have the right to eat.

995
00:33:36,850 --> 00:33:37,955
Go away.

996
00:33:38,180 --> 00:33:39,849
Please, stay in character!

997
00:33:39,850 --> 00:33:41,449
- Maybe you haven't heard, - Stay in character!

998
00:33:41,450 --> 00:33:42,765
- but zombies get hungry. - You need to get your own.

999
00:33:43,150 --> 00:33:44,294
Let's try it.

1000
00:33:44,319 --> 00:33:45,435
You're so mean.

1001
00:33:45,590 --> 00:33:46,794
I bought that.

1002
00:33:48,559 --> 00:33:50,435
(Slurping)

1003
00:33:50,729 --> 00:33:52,005
He's the neighborhood fool.

1004
00:33:52,130 --> 00:33:53,275
Isn't that Dong Goo?

1005
00:33:53,600 --> 00:33:54,968
- Why do you look so... - That's Dong Goo.

1006
00:33:54,969 --> 00:33:56,844
- It's Dong Goo. - Dong Goo!

1007
00:33:57,400 --> 00:33:58,839
What do you mean?

1008
00:33:58,840 --> 00:34:00,515
Can you say, "It's hot"?

1009
00:34:01,110 --> 00:34:03,409
(He blows on the food and looks just like Dong Goo.)

1010
00:34:03,410 --> 00:34:05,208
- See? He's even blowing on it. - It's Dong Goo.

1011
00:34:05,209 --> 00:34:06,538
He's even blowing on it.

1012
00:34:06,539 --> 00:34:08,208
- No, I'm just eating. - It's Dong Goo.

1013
00:34:08,209 --> 00:34:09,584
- You're acting like Dong Goo. - This is just me eating.

1014
00:34:10,479 --> 00:34:12,995
Don't you need to hurry if you want to take all four routes?

1015
00:34:13,450 --> 00:34:16,365
Don't you wish they all took our route?

1016
00:34:16,689 --> 00:34:17,794
Why?

1017
00:34:17,859 --> 00:34:20,459
I was eliminated before I could get to the end.

1018
00:34:20,460 --> 00:34:23,764
I heard from him that in the end, it was no joke.

1019
00:34:24,200 --> 00:34:25,635
- I can bet my whole fortune on it. - Really?

1020
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:27,099
Then how does this sound?

1021
00:34:27,100 --> 00:34:29,898
We can wager one crucial clue about the bio-terrorist...

1022
00:34:29,899 --> 00:34:31,369
and two people can challenge...

1023
00:34:31,370 --> 00:34:33,775
- the route they just took. - Okay.

1024
00:34:34,140 --> 00:34:36,539
It has to be someone who said they're not the bio-terrorist.

1025
00:34:36,540 --> 00:34:39,084
The bio-terrorist can fail it.

1026
00:34:39,410 --> 00:34:40,925
So that we can't get the clue.

1027
00:34:41,049 --> 00:34:43,179
- So you have to do it. - I guess I should do it.

1028
00:34:43,180 --> 00:34:44,679
- You and Kwang Soo. - You're right.

1029
00:34:44,680 --> 00:34:45,925
To be honest...

1030
00:34:46,419 --> 00:34:48,825
I don't know what it is, but if I try hard enough, I can...

1031
00:34:49,149 --> 00:34:51,459
Then Kwang Soo and Jong Kook will go.

1032
00:34:51,460 --> 00:34:52,559
- Yes, you two should go. - Okay.

1033
00:34:52,560 --> 00:34:55,965
(Kwang Soo and Jong Kook decide to attempt the mission.)

1034
00:34:56,589 --> 00:34:59,499
- Then, Jong Kook and Kwang Soo. - Do they go together?

1035
00:34:59,500 --> 00:35:01,269
- Let's try it. - I'm curious, though.

1036
00:35:01,270 --> 00:35:02,528
Can't we just watch?

1037
00:35:02,529 --> 00:35:04,914
- Yes, let's get that clue. - We'll be back.

1038
00:35:05,770 --> 00:35:07,369
That vinegar-man... What was it again?

1039
00:35:07,370 --> 00:35:08,814
- The bio-terrorist. - The bio-terrorist.

1040
00:35:09,770 --> 00:35:11,514
Let's just get him sorted.

1041
00:35:11,810 --> 00:35:13,608
- I will explain Route One. - Yes, sir!

1042
00:35:13,609 --> 00:35:15,579
You will have to go to the convenience store and back...

1043
00:35:15,580 --> 00:35:18,354
within 30 minutes, without running.

1044
00:35:18,879 --> 00:35:20,579
- However, - There's something else.

1045
00:35:20,580 --> 00:35:22,525
you cannot laugh.

1046
00:35:23,149 --> 00:35:24,519
I think I can do that.

1047
00:35:24,520 --> 00:35:25,664
Me too.

1048
00:35:25,790 --> 00:35:28,688
You will just have to buy a drink.

1049
00:35:28,689 --> 00:35:29,789
I think there is something else.

1050
00:35:29,790 --> 00:35:31,905
It's making me nervous.

1051
00:35:33,100 --> 00:35:34,099
(Smirking)

1052
00:35:34,100 --> 00:35:35,405
We should laugh it out now.

1053
00:35:37,069 --> 00:35:39,945
Gosh, I keep laughing because we can't laugh.

1054
00:35:40,239 --> 00:35:42,338
Get angry. Think of something that makes you angry.

1055
00:35:42,339 --> 00:35:43,909
(They try to get angry so that they won't laugh.)

1056
00:35:43,910 --> 00:35:45,985
Jong Kook, should we slap each other?

1057
00:35:46,410 --> 00:35:48,124
- I'm serious. To get a bit... - Sure.

1058
00:35:48,980 --> 00:35:50,184
(Then I'll go first...)

1059
00:35:50,310 --> 00:35:51,449
(Slap!)

1060
00:35:51,450 --> 00:35:53,055
Jong Kook.

1061
00:35:53,819 --> 00:35:57,095
Jong Kook. This is for a really important clue.

1062
00:35:57,219 --> 00:35:58,365
Yes.

1063
00:35:58,620 --> 00:36:00,088
Right? It's because...

1064
00:36:00,089 --> 00:36:03,164
- Why else would I hit you? - Sure.

1065
00:36:03,230 --> 00:36:06,204
We need to feel a bit offended.

1066
00:36:06,430 --> 00:36:07,945
I'm offended a lot.

1067
00:36:08,569 --> 00:36:10,329
I'll be offended,

1068
00:36:10,330 --> 00:36:11,798
but you might not be able to walk.

1069
00:36:11,799 --> 00:36:14,345
(I'll be offended, but you might not be able to walk.)

1070
00:36:15,370 --> 00:36:16,615
To be honest,

1071
00:36:16,839 --> 00:36:18,238
I was a bit startled by the sound.

1072
00:36:18,239 --> 00:36:19,454
(To be honest, I was a bit startled by the sound.)

1073
00:36:19,609 --> 00:36:22,655
I didn't put any makeup on, so my face is sticky.

1074
00:36:22,810 --> 00:36:24,148
I won't hit you hard.

1075
00:36:24,149 --> 00:36:26,124
(It is Kwang Soo's turn to get slapped for the mission.)

1076
00:36:26,379 --> 00:36:29,025
(Slap!)

1077
00:36:29,319 --> 00:36:30,588
(Let's see...)

1078
00:36:30,589 --> 00:36:33,235
It's weird because it wasn't that loud, but it hurts.

1079
00:36:33,589 --> 00:36:34,588
(He is the best at this.)

1080
00:36:34,589 --> 00:36:36,365
No! It wasn't loud, right?

1081
00:36:36,529 --> 00:36:37,599
Right? It wasn't loud.

1082
00:36:37,600 --> 00:36:39,035
- Are you sure it wasn't your fist? - Yes.

1083
00:36:39,200 --> 00:36:40,429
Why? Did that upset you?

1084
00:36:40,430 --> 00:36:41,505
DO you need another slap?

1085
00:36:41,700 --> 00:36:44,314
(You're the one who hit me. Can't you tell?)

1086
00:36:44,669 --> 00:36:45,838
Let's go. Now is the moment.

1087
00:36:45,839 --> 00:36:47,238
All right, wait.

1088
00:36:47,239 --> 00:36:48,338
(While the two stifled their laughter with anger...)

1089
00:36:48,339 --> 00:36:49,644
What is it?

1090
00:36:49,710 --> 00:36:50,885
It's...

1091
00:36:51,710 --> 00:36:53,139
trying not to laugh.

1092
00:36:53,140 --> 00:36:54,548
- You can't laugh, but... - And?

1093
00:36:54,549 --> 00:36:57,755
These high schoolers come and ask for your autograph,

1094
00:36:57,779 --> 00:36:59,195
and the third girl...

1095
00:36:59,480 --> 00:37:01,849
has a unibrow and a mustache out of her nose hairs like this.

1096
00:37:01,850 --> 00:37:05,164
She has a mustache, and she tucks it behind her ears.

1097
00:37:05,560 --> 00:37:07,564
I wouldn't have been able to hold it back.

1098
00:37:07,589 --> 00:37:10,735
They're professionals. The kids know how to make it funny.

1099
00:37:10,899 --> 00:37:12,659
They're really great.

1100
00:37:12,660 --> 00:37:14,135
I couldn't hold back at the second stage...

1101
00:37:14,270 --> 00:37:16,604
because some woman was making fish-shaped buns...

1102
00:37:17,299 --> 00:37:19,615
with her face painted blue.

1103
00:37:19,669 --> 00:37:22,338
- She looked like Yondu. - She was smiling like Yondu.

1104
00:37:22,339 --> 00:37:23,814
I asked, "What are you doing dressed like this?"

1105
00:37:23,939 --> 00:37:26,084
She said, "I know. I don't know why I'm here like this either."

1106
00:37:26,640 --> 00:37:27,809
(She suddenly realized her situation.)

1107
00:37:27,810 --> 00:37:29,025
Was that where you laughed?

1108
00:37:29,410 --> 00:37:30,508
I burst into laughter at that point.

1109
00:37:30,509 --> 00:37:31,579
The buns were really good too.

1110
00:37:31,580 --> 00:37:33,179
- Was that what you ate? - They were good.

1111
00:37:33,180 --> 00:37:35,595
It was really good and that made it even funnier.

1112
00:37:36,390 --> 00:37:37,389
Everything was funny.

1113
00:37:37,390 --> 00:37:39,035
(They hope Kwang Soo and Jong Kook hold out.)

1114
00:37:39,520 --> 00:37:40,619
I'm very upset right now.

1115
00:37:40,620 --> 00:37:42,664
- Kwang Soo, I... - What is it?

1116
00:37:42,859 --> 00:37:45,258
I'm very upset right now.

1117
00:37:45,259 --> 00:37:46,699
I can keep myself from laughing.

1118
00:37:46,700 --> 00:37:47,798
- Of course! - I tend to keep it in.

1119
00:37:47,799 --> 00:37:50,144
- You had that part in the movie. - Yes.

1120
00:37:50,169 --> 00:37:52,144
- When you had your ankle cut. - Yes.

1121
00:37:53,569 --> 00:37:55,539
- We're huge fans! - We're huge fans!

1122
00:37:55,540 --> 00:37:57,854
- Could I get your autograph? - Could I get your autograph?

1123
00:37:57,980 --> 00:37:59,954
- Can we also take your picture? - Of course.

1124
00:38:00,009 --> 00:38:01,008
Wait a minute.

1125
00:38:01,009 --> 00:38:03,449
- Han Byul! Come here, quick! - Han Byul! Come here.

1126
00:38:03,450 --> 00:38:06,019
- They have a friend. - She looks suspicious. Be careful.

1127
00:38:06,020 --> 00:38:07,378
(He sensed it coming.)

1128
00:38:07,379 --> 00:38:09,048
(Han Byul gets ready.)

1129
00:38:09,049 --> 00:38:10,148
What is it?

1130
00:38:10,149 --> 00:38:11,334
(What is it, guys?)

1131
00:38:11,560 --> 00:38:12,794
- Come here. - Oh my gosh!

1132
00:38:12,819 --> 00:38:13,988
Han Byul.

1133
00:38:13,989 --> 00:38:16,465
(He has his first crisis as Han Byul appears.)

1134
00:38:16,589 --> 00:38:18,775
- It's her nose hair. - Hello.

1135
00:38:19,330 --> 00:38:21,999
- Let me put my nose hair aside. - Han Byul, stop.

1136
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:24,204
Hello. It's my nose hair.

1137
00:38:24,270 --> 00:38:25,438
Oh my gosh!

1138
00:38:25,439 --> 00:38:26,845
(Her nose hair flies around with her excitement.)

1139
00:38:26,899 --> 00:38:28,544
- You can't close your eyes. - No?

1140
00:38:30,140 --> 00:38:32,854
I'm a huge fan, Kwang Soo.

1141
00:38:33,680 --> 00:38:35,755
Oh my gosh, you look even more like a giraffe!

1142
00:38:37,080 --> 00:38:38,979
(Why is "giraffe" so funny today?)

1143
00:38:38,980 --> 00:38:40,249
You're so handsome.

1144
00:38:40,250 --> 00:38:42,148
Han Byul, let's take a picture.

1145
00:38:42,149 --> 00:38:44,019
Let's take a picture!

1146
00:38:44,020 --> 00:38:45,418
Look here.

1147
00:38:45,419 --> 00:38:47,394
(Stop, Han Byul.)

1148
00:38:48,560 --> 00:38:49,764
Your nose hairs are so long.

1149
00:38:50,390 --> 00:38:51,635
Your nose hairs are so long.

1150
00:38:51,960 --> 00:38:53,128
(Kwang Soo?)

1151
00:38:53,129 --> 00:38:55,244
- You look prettier like this. - Really?

1152
00:38:55,270 --> 00:38:56,599
(His random comment makes the third crisis.)

1153
00:38:56,600 --> 00:38:58,175
- I grew them out. - Han Byul, this looks better.

1154
00:38:58,469 --> 00:39:00,075
Don't you think we should go already, Kwang Soo?

1155
00:39:00,239 --> 00:39:02,715
1, 2, 3!

1156
00:39:07,609 --> 00:39:08,679
1, 2, 3!

1157
00:39:08,680 --> 00:39:10,778
I almost laughed while taking the picture.

1158
00:39:10,779 --> 00:39:12,195
(Spin)

1159
00:39:12,319 --> 00:39:13,579
Oh my gosh.

1160
00:39:13,580 --> 00:39:14,664
But...

1161
00:39:14,919 --> 00:39:17,695
It's not funny at all...

1162
00:39:18,060 --> 00:39:20,019
when our members do it, but...

1163
00:39:20,020 --> 00:39:21,434
- This is so. - But...

1164
00:39:21,759 --> 00:39:24,064
I didn't expect nose hairs.

1165
00:39:24,529 --> 00:39:26,099
- Kwang Soo, - Yes?

1166
00:39:26,100 --> 00:39:29,005
I'm concerned about something these days.

1167
00:39:29,969 --> 00:39:30,968
Well...

1168
00:39:30,969 --> 00:39:33,075
My nose hair keeps falling out these days.

1169
00:39:33,239 --> 00:39:34,845
I don't know what to do.

1170
00:39:35,169 --> 00:39:36,285
Thank you.

1171
00:39:36,839 --> 00:39:37,938
If it falls out,

1172
00:39:37,939 --> 00:39:39,215
try eating lots of black beans.

1173
00:39:40,439 --> 00:39:42,325
- Are you sure that will help? - Of course.

1174
00:39:42,379 --> 00:39:44,108
- Black beans... - My uncle uses a wig.

1175
00:39:44,109 --> 00:39:45,994
- helps with hair loss. - A wig.

1176
00:39:46,149 --> 00:39:47,255
Does he?

1177
00:39:48,120 --> 00:39:50,925
- Why won't you look at us? - Let's go. We should go.

1178
00:39:51,819 --> 00:39:53,959
- Goodbye. - Good luck.

1179
00:39:53,960 --> 00:39:56,104
- Good luck! - Here's your autograph.

1180
00:39:56,330 --> 00:39:57,358
Goodbye.

1181
00:39:57,359 --> 00:39:59,459
- You're so handsome! - Goodbye!

1182
00:39:59,460 --> 00:40:00,599
- Thank you. - Thank you.

1183
00:40:00,600 --> 00:40:02,544
- Goodbye. - Goodbye.

1184
00:40:03,299 --> 00:40:04,845
Kwang Soo, to be honest,

1185
00:40:05,239 --> 00:40:07,199
that was really hard for me.

1186
00:40:07,200 --> 00:40:08,409
- It really was. - I know.

1187
00:40:08,410 --> 00:40:09,869
- I wanted to give up. - I know.

1188
00:40:09,870 --> 00:40:12,155
I could tell by the look on your face.

1189
00:40:12,509 --> 00:40:14,885
That was the first time I felt like crying for stifling a laugh.

1190
00:40:15,310 --> 00:40:16,584
- Promise me one thing. - What?

1191
00:40:17,609 --> 00:40:18,825
Don't try to make any funny comments.

1192
00:40:19,180 --> 00:40:20,579
- What do you... - Just...

1193
00:40:20,580 --> 00:40:22,488
- don't answer them. - Don't say anything back?

1194
00:40:22,489 --> 00:40:24,735
- Okay. - I keep laughing...

1195
00:40:24,859 --> 00:40:25,959
at the comments you make.

1196
00:40:25,960 --> 00:40:27,289
Are we not allowed to laugh now?

1197
00:40:27,290 --> 00:40:28,588
- You cannot laugh at all. - Okay.

1198
00:40:28,589 --> 00:40:31,535
- Don't make any comments. - Okay. I get it.

1199
00:40:32,029 --> 00:40:34,159
- Why was that funny? - I don't get why that was funny.

1200
00:40:34,160 --> 00:40:36,374
- We see that all the time. - I know.

1201
00:40:36,669 --> 00:40:38,275
- Where is the convenience store? - Wait.

1202
00:40:38,439 --> 00:40:40,075
Get ready.

1203
00:40:40,799 --> 00:40:43,068
- Why? - Just get ready.

1204
00:40:43,069 --> 00:40:44,679
(Unlike her makeup, she looks very calm.)

1205
00:40:44,680 --> 00:40:47,885
It's just funny to have you next to me.

1206
00:40:48,509 --> 00:40:49,854
Will you slap me again?

1207
00:40:50,109 --> 00:40:51,394
- Let's do that. - Okay.

1208
00:40:51,850 --> 00:40:53,124
(Slap me as well.)

1209
00:40:53,549 --> 00:40:56,494
(They get ready in front of the fish-shaped bun stand.)

1210
00:40:56,549 --> 00:40:58,119
You cannot laugh here.

1211
00:40:58,120 --> 00:40:59,535
(Don't make any comments.)

1212
00:40:59,859 --> 00:41:02,088
- Hold it in. - Okay. I'll hold it in.

1213
00:41:02,089 --> 00:41:03,735
- We're very angry. - Yes.

1214
00:41:04,460 --> 00:41:05,874
- We're angry. - We're almost there.

1215
00:41:07,060 --> 00:41:08,199
We're very angry.

1216
00:41:08,200 --> 00:41:09,505
(She slowly looks their way.)

1217
00:41:09,730 --> 00:41:10,845
Oh, gosh...

1218
00:41:11,500 --> 00:41:13,474
Would you like some fish-shaped buns?

1219
00:41:15,469 --> 00:41:18,108
I have both choux cream flavor and red bean flavor.

1220
00:41:18,109 --> 00:41:19,108
(She is too kind.)

1221
00:41:19,109 --> 00:41:21,825
Come on here and try some.

1222
00:41:22,810 --> 00:41:25,019
- But... - Why are you just watching me?

1223
00:41:25,020 --> 00:41:26,854
Come over here.

1224
00:41:27,379 --> 00:41:29,624
(He looks at the sky. He closes his eyes.)

1225
00:41:31,390 --> 00:41:33,059
Why are you closing your eyes?

1226
00:41:33,060 --> 00:41:35,005
Come here and try some.

1227
00:41:35,290 --> 00:41:36,758
(Stubborn)

1228
00:41:36,759 --> 00:41:37,959
Are your eyes open now?

1229
00:41:37,960 --> 00:41:39,334
Just try crying.

1230
00:41:40,730 --> 00:41:42,945
Open your eyes and take a bun.

1231
00:41:43,529 --> 00:41:44,699
(No matter how angry or sad he gets, the woman looks calm.)

1232
00:41:44,700 --> 00:41:46,644
I don't think I can do this. What do I do?

1233
00:41:46,770 --> 00:41:48,445
I actually have something I really want to say.

1234
00:41:48,969 --> 00:41:50,744
Me too. If I say it,

1235
00:41:50,939 --> 00:41:52,454
- We're going to laugh for sure. - Why I'm... Yes.

1236
00:41:52,609 --> 00:41:53,639
I'm going to laugh for sure.

1237
00:41:53,640 --> 00:41:54,925
I'm a fan!

1238
00:41:56,509 --> 00:41:57,778
I'm a fan!

1239
00:41:57,779 --> 00:42:00,095
(Stop...)

1240
00:42:00,680 --> 00:42:03,048
Let me see your face. I'm a fan.

1241
00:42:03,049 --> 00:42:04,988
(They weep. She's a fan.)

1242
00:42:04,989 --> 00:42:08,035
(Wailing)

1243
00:42:10,430 --> 00:42:13,358
(She's a professional who won't budge at all.)

1244
00:42:13,359 --> 00:42:14,898
(Let's just go.)

1245
00:42:14,899 --> 00:42:18,514
Don't cry. Why would you cry when I'm a fan?

1246
00:42:18,600 --> 00:42:20,744
(Freeze)

1247
00:42:21,569 --> 00:42:24,144
(Think sad thoughts.)

1248
00:42:24,339 --> 00:42:25,954
- Which one would you like? - We need to cry.

1249
00:42:26,310 --> 00:42:27,715
Red bean or choux cream?

1250
00:42:28,810 --> 00:42:29,885
Which one?

1251
00:42:30,180 --> 00:42:32,619
Choux cream or red bean?

1252
00:42:32,620 --> 00:42:33,718
I can't stand it!

1253
00:42:33,719 --> 00:42:34,894
(Please stop.)

1254
00:42:36,219 --> 00:42:37,664
(Punch)

1255
00:42:38,259 --> 00:42:39,559
(We are angry right now!)

1256
00:42:39,560 --> 00:42:40,688
Red bean flavor?

1257
00:42:40,689 --> 00:42:42,389
- Let's go. - Red bean flavor?

1258
00:42:42,390 --> 00:42:44,159
Would you like the red bean flavor or the choux cream puff flavor?

1259
00:42:44,160 --> 00:42:46,704
- Any flavor is fine. - Don't cry.

1260
00:42:46,899 --> 00:42:49,329
- Which one... - Any flavor is fine.

1261
00:42:49,330 --> 00:42:50,769
- Choux flavor? - Take the red bean flavor.

1262
00:42:50,770 --> 00:42:51,874
Red bean flavor?

1263
00:42:52,239 --> 00:42:55,039
Why won't you look at me? I am a fan.

1264
00:42:55,040 --> 00:42:56,108
(A long-time fan begs Kwang Soo to look at her.)

1265
00:42:56,109 --> 00:42:57,838
I looked, I looked.

1266
00:42:57,839 --> 00:42:59,278
- Did you look? - I looked.

1267
00:42:59,279 --> 00:43:01,479
Kwang Soo, won't you look at me?

1268
00:43:01,480 --> 00:43:02,909
(Taking a peek)

1269
00:43:02,910 --> 00:43:04,108
What's wrong?

1270
00:43:04,109 --> 00:43:06,624
- Kwang Soo, cry. - Why won't you look at me?

1271
00:43:06,750 --> 00:43:09,195
(I shouldn't have looked.)

1272
00:43:09,750 --> 00:43:10,789
1, 2, 3.

1273
00:43:10,790 --> 00:43:12,494
(Bawling)

1274
00:43:13,020 --> 00:43:15,088
Did something bad happen?

1275
00:43:15,089 --> 00:43:16,459
Why are you crying?

1276
00:43:16,460 --> 00:43:18,628
- I guess something bad happened. - We will get going now.

1277
00:43:18,629 --> 00:43:20,229
- Thank you. - Thank you.

1278
00:43:20,230 --> 00:43:22,099
- Ma'am, we are sorry. - We are sorry.

1279
00:43:22,100 --> 00:43:23,769
What's wrong?

1280
00:43:23,770 --> 00:43:24,914
(They suppress their laughter with tears and pass stage 2.)

1281
00:43:25,299 --> 00:43:26,898
(I came close.)

1282
00:43:26,899 --> 00:43:29,285
Crying really works.

1283
00:43:30,910 --> 00:43:32,579
I wouldn't have passed that stage without crying.

1284
00:43:32,580 --> 00:43:33,715
(They stop crying and eat the tear-soaked fish-shaped bun.)

1285
00:43:36,779 --> 00:43:38,418
(What is this taste?)

1286
00:43:38,419 --> 00:43:39,624
It's tasty.

1287
00:43:40,350 --> 00:43:41,994
The fact that it's tasty makes me want to laugh.

1288
00:43:43,020 --> 00:43:45,588
(She is the master of the fish-shaped bun.)

1289
00:43:45,589 --> 00:43:46,834
Don't laugh.

1290
00:43:47,790 --> 00:43:49,064
You know,

1291
00:43:49,259 --> 00:43:50,789
she really seems like a food cart owner.

1292
00:43:50,790 --> 00:43:52,635
(It seems that way.)

1293
00:43:54,259 --> 00:43:56,769
(Crying)

1294
00:43:56,770 --> 00:43:59,499
(We are sorry, ma'am.)

1295
00:43:59,500 --> 00:44:01,215
Are you laughing?

1296
00:44:01,439 --> 00:44:03,084
We are crying.

1297
00:44:04,310 --> 00:44:05,854
It really seems like she sells fish-shaped buns.

1298
00:44:06,379 --> 00:44:07,979
- Stop it. - Okay. Let's go.

1299
00:44:07,980 --> 00:44:09,555
- Stop with your comments. - Okay. Let's go.

1300
00:44:09,680 --> 00:44:10,925
Okay.

1301
00:44:11,419 --> 00:44:13,525
Seok Jin went pretty far.

1302
00:44:13,950 --> 00:44:16,889
Doing this task as a group of two makes it worse.

1303
00:44:16,890 --> 00:44:18,659
- Everything seems funnier. - I know.

1304
00:44:18,660 --> 00:44:20,258
Had I been alone, I wouldn't have had a problem.

1305
00:44:20,259 --> 00:44:22,289
That's why I am not looking at you.

1306
00:44:22,290 --> 00:44:24,599
- Seeing you suppress laughter... - I know.

1307
00:44:24,600 --> 00:44:26,499
Doing this task as a group of two makes it worse.

1308
00:44:26,500 --> 00:44:27,604
You are right.

1309
00:44:27,629 --> 00:44:29,229
Se Chan even made it through here.

1310
00:44:29,230 --> 00:44:30,345
There is...

1311
00:44:31,100 --> 00:44:33,275
I sense something from the right. Get ready.

1312
00:44:34,100 --> 00:44:35,968
- Hello. - Hello.

1313
00:44:35,969 --> 00:44:38,378
- I am a fan. May I take a photo? - Sure.

1314
00:44:38,379 --> 00:44:39,378
Thank you.

1315
00:44:39,379 --> 00:44:42,008
(All of my fans are in this neighborhood.)

1316
00:44:42,009 --> 00:44:43,285
Cry.

1317
00:44:43,379 --> 00:44:44,508
This is...

1318
00:44:44,509 --> 00:44:45,648
(They aren't sure if she is a real fan or a hired actress.)

1319
00:44:45,649 --> 00:44:47,318
- What is this? - I want a photo.

1320
00:44:47,319 --> 00:44:49,394
(Jong Kook cries already.)

1321
00:44:49,489 --> 00:44:50,894
Thank you.

1322
00:44:51,660 --> 00:44:53,095
(Kicking)

1323
00:44:53,290 --> 00:44:54,318
Thank you.

1324
00:44:54,319 --> 00:44:55,688
(She takes a selfie...)

1325
00:44:55,689 --> 00:44:57,434
(and kicks the phone without hesitation.)

1326
00:44:58,029 --> 00:45:02,874
(Cartwheeling)

1327
00:45:04,169 --> 00:45:06,275
(Oh, no!)

1328
00:45:07,069 --> 00:45:08,769
(Like a fool,)

1329
00:45:08,770 --> 00:45:11,314
(he ended up looking at the woman!)

1330
00:45:11,739 --> 00:45:14,684
(The intense way she goes home is unforgettable.)

1331
00:45:15,580 --> 00:45:17,479
(Antsy)

1332
00:45:17,480 --> 00:45:19,425
(Get a hold of yourself, Kwang Soo!)

1333
00:45:20,850 --> 00:45:22,449
(Suppressing laughter)

1334
00:45:22,450 --> 00:45:23,925
You didn't see her leave, did you?

1335
00:45:24,520 --> 00:45:27,394
(Don't talk about it.)

1336
00:45:30,029 --> 00:45:32,135
She cartwheeled down the street.

1337
00:45:34,830 --> 00:45:36,369
(You could have walked comfortably.)

1338
00:45:36,370 --> 00:45:39,345
(Why did you use such a difficult method?)

1339
00:45:39,600 --> 00:45:41,345
(Cartwheeling)

1340
00:45:41,569 --> 00:45:43,709
I thought I was seeing things.

1341
00:45:43,710 --> 00:45:44,778
(Crying)

1342
00:45:44,779 --> 00:45:47,485
She tumbled her way back home.

1343
00:45:48,410 --> 00:45:50,909
(Please stop talking!)

1344
00:45:50,910 --> 00:45:53,019
(Trudging)

1345
00:45:53,020 --> 00:45:55,064
She looked like a regular woman, but she tumbled...

1346
00:45:56,250 --> 00:45:58,059
(It's etched on my mind.)

1347
00:45:58,060 --> 00:46:00,818
(They pass stage 3 as they bawl.)

1348
00:46:00,819 --> 00:46:02,104
When I arrived at the convenience store...

1349
00:46:02,759 --> 00:46:04,699
- What? - I was so startled.

1350
00:46:04,700 --> 00:46:08,275
The employee at the convenience store...

1351
00:46:08,469 --> 00:46:11,474
(Is the employee surprising?)

1352
00:46:14,710 --> 00:46:15,738
(They burst out laughing.)

1353
00:46:15,739 --> 00:46:16,945
They will laugh for sure.

1354
00:46:16,969 --> 00:46:19,285
He stood like this.

1355
00:46:19,310 --> 00:46:21,679
I had no choice but to laugh.

1356
00:46:21,680 --> 00:46:22,925
Seriously.

1357
00:46:23,649 --> 00:46:24,718
Seriously.

1358
00:46:24,719 --> 00:46:26,718
They'll definitely laugh.

1359
00:46:26,719 --> 00:46:28,124
I couldn't hold it in.

1360
00:46:28,719 --> 00:46:29,749
You should go and see.

1361
00:46:29,750 --> 00:46:31,818
I already feel like I have been there.

1362
00:46:31,819 --> 00:46:34,519
We keep crying after a short conversation.

1363
00:46:34,520 --> 00:46:35,735
I know.

1364
00:46:35,890 --> 00:46:37,389
This is driving me crazy.

1365
00:46:37,390 --> 00:46:39,528
- This is where Se Chan failed. - We came so far.

1366
00:46:39,529 --> 00:46:40,805
Se Chan? Okay.

1367
00:46:40,930 --> 00:46:42,798
- Okay. - There are two of us. You...

1368
00:46:42,799 --> 00:46:44,398
- I won't open my mouth. - Get ready.

1369
00:46:44,399 --> 00:46:45,945
What? There is a convenience store!

1370
00:46:46,799 --> 00:46:48,068
You startled me.

1371
00:46:48,069 --> 00:46:49,568
Be careful when you enter the convenience store.

1372
00:46:49,569 --> 00:46:52,155
There has to be something inside.

1373
00:46:52,710 --> 00:46:55,449
(They set their minds once again.)

1374
00:46:55,450 --> 00:46:56,655
Okay.

1375
00:46:56,879 --> 00:46:58,755
I am angry. I am very angry right now.

1376
00:46:59,350 --> 00:47:01,195
(For goodness' sake!)

1377
00:47:03,750 --> 00:47:05,535
(Crying)

1378
00:47:06,819 --> 00:47:09,405
(An overly solemn assistant producer makes an appearance.)

1379
00:47:09,930 --> 00:47:12,235
(Let's have sad thoughts.)

1380
00:47:12,830 --> 00:47:15,675
(They can sense that stage 4 is extraordinary.)

1381
00:47:16,799 --> 00:47:19,438
(Feeling nervous, they approach the assistant producer.)

1382
00:47:19,439 --> 00:47:21,115
- Is that the assistant producer? - Be careful.

1383
00:47:21,140 --> 00:47:22,945
Hurry up and cry, Kwang Soo. 1, 2.

1384
00:47:23,040 --> 00:47:25,679
(Bawling)

1385
00:47:25,680 --> 00:47:28,249
(Okay. We are almost there!)

1386
00:47:28,250 --> 00:47:30,655
I will give you money for the mission.

1387
00:47:32,120 --> 00:47:33,755
(Hurry up and give it to me!)

1388
00:47:34,549 --> 00:47:35,794
Hold on.

1389
00:47:36,549 --> 00:47:38,294
Here you go.

1390
00:47:44,290 --> 00:47:46,505
(Cute)

1391
00:47:46,830 --> 00:47:49,505
(Why did they go to this extent?)

1392
00:47:50,069 --> 00:47:52,374
(Get your anger level up!)

1393
00:47:54,040 --> 00:47:55,668
Please get a cash receipt.

1394
00:47:55,669 --> 00:47:58,139
(The assistant producer worries about totaling the payments later.)

1395
00:47:58,140 --> 00:47:59,985
(I won't look.)

1396
00:48:00,279 --> 00:48:03,084
(They barely manage to pass stage 4.)

1397
00:48:03,810 --> 00:48:06,048
(Only the grand stage 5 remains.)

1398
00:48:06,049 --> 00:48:08,019
Be careful. There must be something inside.

1399
00:48:08,020 --> 00:48:09,188
Keep your guard up.

1400
00:48:09,189 --> 00:48:10,548
(They will succeed if they buy a bottle of water.)

1401
00:48:10,549 --> 00:48:14,419
(Will they be able to pass stage 5 without laughing?)

1402
00:48:16,410 --> 00:48:18,648
(Only the grand stage 5 remains.)

1403
00:48:18,649 --> 00:48:20,619
Be careful. There must be something inside.

1404
00:48:20,620 --> 00:48:21,788
Keep your guard up.

1405
00:48:21,789 --> 00:48:23,148
(They will succeed if they buy a bottle of water.)

1406
00:48:23,149 --> 00:48:27,094
(Will they be able to pass stage 5 without laughing?)

1407
00:48:29,229 --> 00:48:31,259
(Kwang Soo bursts out laughing.)

1408
00:48:31,260 --> 00:48:32,335
What is it?

1409
00:48:33,399 --> 00:48:35,168
(He collapses as soon as he takes a look.)

1410
00:48:35,169 --> 00:48:37,244
What is it? What is it?

1411
00:48:38,600 --> 00:48:41,445
(What could be stage 5?)

1412
00:48:42,589 --> 00:48:44,805
(Who is this man?)

1413
00:48:45,460 --> 00:48:48,559
(Han Ki Bum, Ex-basketball player and Kwang Soo's doppelganger)

1414
00:48:48,560 --> 00:48:50,274
(Sultry)

1415
00:48:52,429 --> 00:48:55,044
(A single glance knocks Kwang Soo out.)

1416
00:48:55,670 --> 00:48:57,785
What is it? What is it?

1417
00:48:58,239 --> 00:49:00,644
(Kwang Soo fails at stage 5.)

1418
00:49:03,210 --> 00:49:05,584
(What could it be?)

1419
00:49:05,880 --> 00:49:08,394
(Beyond imagination)

1420
00:49:09,480 --> 00:49:11,118
(Rolling on the floor)

1421
00:49:11,119 --> 00:49:13,325
Don't. Please don't.

1422
00:49:13,449 --> 00:49:15,095
Don't go in.

1423
00:49:16,219 --> 00:49:17,459
Don't go in.

1424
00:49:17,460 --> 00:49:18,758
Give up right here and now.

1425
00:49:18,759 --> 00:49:20,205
Don't go in.

1426
00:49:20,860 --> 00:49:23,604
(The boss of stage 5, Han Ki Bum)

1427
00:49:24,230 --> 00:49:25,868
- I am too scared to go in. - I can't believe it.

1428
00:49:25,869 --> 00:49:27,599
This is cheating!

1429
00:49:27,600 --> 00:49:29,345
I am too scared to go in. Is it that bad?

1430
00:49:29,600 --> 00:49:31,385
- Is it that bad? - I mean,

1431
00:49:31,409 --> 00:49:34,354
it might be rude to say it's bad, but...

1432
00:49:34,540 --> 00:49:36,484
What is he doing there?

1433
00:49:36,610 --> 00:49:38,584
- Jong Kook, go in. - What is he...

1434
00:49:39,009 --> 00:49:40,948
I will succeed no matter what.

1435
00:49:40,949 --> 00:49:43,024
Seriously. Don't come in.

1436
00:49:43,150 --> 00:49:46,789
We suffered too much to fail here. Don't laugh.

1437
00:49:46,790 --> 00:49:48,419
Is it funny? Is it funny?

1438
00:49:48,420 --> 00:49:49,488
Jong Kook.

1439
00:49:49,489 --> 00:49:51,234
(Give up.)

1440
00:49:52,389 --> 00:49:54,798
It will be beyond your imagination.

1441
00:49:54,799 --> 00:49:56,935
You won't be able to guess. I am serious.

1442
00:49:57,100 --> 00:49:59,144
Buy a bottle of water and come on out.

1443
00:49:59,199 --> 00:50:00,499
- Jong Kook. - I just need to buy water.

1444
00:50:00,500 --> 00:50:02,068
You just need to buy water. It's not hard.

1445
00:50:02,069 --> 00:50:03,138
I ask for water,

1446
00:50:03,139 --> 00:50:04,368
- Buy water and come out. - hand him cash,

1447
00:50:04,369 --> 00:50:06,008
- and he rings me up. - Yes, then walk out.

1448
00:50:06,009 --> 00:50:07,115
(It's the easiest mission in the world.)

1449
00:50:07,210 --> 00:50:09,838
(A strong man)

1450
00:50:09,839 --> 00:50:11,984
(A weak man)

1451
00:50:12,650 --> 00:50:14,919
(If he perseveres and succeeds, he will receive a crucial hint.)

1452
00:50:14,920 --> 00:50:17,318
Just get a bottle of water. Get it first.

1453
00:50:17,319 --> 00:50:18,448
Okay. Water.

1454
00:50:18,449 --> 00:50:21,234
(He walks over to get a bottle of water.)

1455
00:50:23,089 --> 00:50:24,535
(Halting)

1456
00:50:25,690 --> 00:50:27,758
I think I saw him in the corner of my eye.

1457
00:50:27,759 --> 00:50:29,774
(I think I saw him in the corner of my eye.)

1458
00:50:30,060 --> 00:50:31,129
(Bawling)

1459
00:50:31,130 --> 00:50:34,638
Water. Where is water? Water.

1460
00:50:34,639 --> 00:50:36,345
(I saw a big silhouette.)

1461
00:50:36,569 --> 00:50:39,468
(Kwang Soo is still suffering.)

1462
00:50:39,469 --> 00:50:41,584
He is like a cheat code.

1463
00:50:43,339 --> 00:50:44,955
This is cheating.

1464
00:50:46,179 --> 00:50:47,655
Did he see him? Did Jong Kook see him?

1465
00:50:48,219 --> 00:50:49,218
Water.

1466
00:50:49,219 --> 00:50:51,495
(Jong Kook is desperately searching for water.)

1467
00:50:52,790 --> 00:50:54,318
(He loads up his tears...)

1468
00:50:54,319 --> 00:50:57,635
(and marches towards the cashier.)

1469
00:50:59,830 --> 00:51:02,099
(He can't do it.)

1470
00:51:02,100 --> 00:51:03,205
(Bawling)

1471
00:51:05,000 --> 00:51:07,104
(Kwang Soo can't breathe.)

1472
00:51:07,500 --> 00:51:10,175
(You did your best. Just give up.)

1473
00:51:10,940 --> 00:51:13,345
(He's calm.)

1474
00:51:15,139 --> 00:51:16,314
Why?

1475
00:51:16,980 --> 00:51:19,185
(He braces himself and tries again.)

1476
00:51:19,650 --> 00:51:22,225
(He retreats again.)

1477
00:51:22,750 --> 00:51:25,564
I can't do it. I can't go in.

1478
00:51:25,719 --> 00:51:27,419
(He can only watch.)

1479
00:51:27,420 --> 00:51:28,694
Go inside.

1480
00:51:29,520 --> 00:51:32,805
(He breathes rapidly as if he has heartburn.)

1481
00:51:34,029 --> 00:51:36,075
How much is it?

1482
00:51:36,659 --> 00:51:39,075
(They finally meet.)

1483
00:51:40,130 --> 00:51:42,399
It's 7.77 dollars.

1484
00:51:42,400 --> 00:51:43,475
(It's 7.77 dollars.)

1485
00:51:44,909 --> 00:51:47,444
(He's flustered by the unexpected joke.)

1486
00:51:48,380 --> 00:51:50,638
Hey, that's wrong.

1487
00:51:50,639 --> 00:51:53,155
(Female owner: Hey, that's wrong.)

1488
00:51:53,210 --> 00:51:55,048
You're in high school, and you still can't do math?

1489
00:51:55,049 --> 00:51:56,548
(You're in high school, and you still can't do math?)

1490
00:51:56,549 --> 00:51:58,448
(He's in high school?)

1491
00:51:58,449 --> 00:52:00,289
- I'm sorry. - You should be.

1492
00:52:00,290 --> 00:52:02,158
You're a student. You should be able to calculate that.

1493
00:52:02,159 --> 00:52:03,294
I'm sorry.

1494
00:52:03,489 --> 00:52:04,729
He's a student.

1495
00:52:04,730 --> 00:52:05,729
(He's a student.)

1496
00:52:05,730 --> 00:52:06,988
He's a student.

1497
00:52:06,989 --> 00:52:08,705
(The man's identity is a mystery.)

1498
00:52:09,100 --> 00:52:10,405
I'm sorry.

1499
00:52:12,469 --> 00:52:16,214
(A huge mosquito bit me!)

1500
00:52:16,569 --> 00:52:20,084
<i>It was itchy</i>

1501
00:52:20,509 --> 00:52:23,309
<i>A huge mosquito bit me!</i>

1502
00:52:23,310 --> 00:52:24,725
<i>It was itchy</i>

1503
00:52:24,750 --> 00:52:26,225
(It was really...)

1504
00:52:27,409 --> 00:52:28,519
I forgot the lines.

1505
00:52:28,520 --> 00:52:29,825
(He's jolly.)

1506
00:52:30,750 --> 00:52:31,749
Let me try again.

1507
00:52:31,750 --> 00:52:34,464
(A huge mosquito bit my foot!)

1508
00:52:34,560 --> 00:52:37,318
(He chants passionately with blood vessels in his neck showing.)

1509
00:52:37,319 --> 00:52:38,964
(He feels much better.)

1510
00:52:39,029 --> 00:52:42,028
(Why are you trying so hard, my hero?)

1511
00:52:42,029 --> 00:52:44,428
<i>It was itchy</i>

1512
00:52:44,429 --> 00:52:45,568
But...

1513
00:52:45,569 --> 00:52:47,669
(He attacks again.)

1514
00:52:47,670 --> 00:52:50,374
(Quit it now.)

1515
00:52:51,739 --> 00:52:53,039
Is it still not funny?

1516
00:52:53,040 --> 00:52:55,338
(Student: Is it still not funny?)

1517
00:52:55,339 --> 00:52:56,338
No.

1518
00:52:56,339 --> 00:52:57,678
- What? - Is it still not funny?

1519
00:52:57,679 --> 00:52:58,749
(Jong Kook struggles to count bills. He's vulnerable.)

1520
00:52:58,750 --> 00:53:00,124
How much is it?

1521
00:53:00,250 --> 00:53:01,778
7.77 dollars.

1522
00:53:01,779 --> 00:53:03,379
- 7 dollars! - 70...

1523
00:53:03,380 --> 00:53:04,995
7.77 dollars.

1524
00:53:05,119 --> 00:53:06,595
Here!

1525
00:53:07,860 --> 00:53:09,658
(He tries to leave in a hurry.)

1526
00:53:09,659 --> 00:53:11,359
- Do the math. - Take your change.

1527
00:53:11,360 --> 00:53:12,834
- I don't need it! - Take your change.

1528
00:53:13,560 --> 00:53:14,999
I don't need it!

1529
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:17,435
- Take seven cents back. - Keep it.

1530
00:53:18,270 --> 00:53:19,374
What do we do?

1531
00:53:20,429 --> 00:53:23,044
Why is he there?

1532
00:53:23,100 --> 00:53:24,984
(Staggering)

1533
00:53:25,139 --> 00:53:26,769
(Laughing)

1534
00:53:26,770 --> 00:53:29,379
He's a strong opponent.

1535
00:53:29,380 --> 00:53:30,439
- Jong Kook. - Am I okay?

1536
00:53:30,440 --> 00:53:32,624
- It's over. - I'm going to tear up.

1537
00:53:33,580 --> 00:53:35,455
- How did you resist that? - Goodness.

1538
00:53:35,619 --> 00:53:38,164
I got water and walked up to him.

1539
00:53:38,190 --> 00:53:39,548
I almost died.

1540
00:53:39,549 --> 00:53:40,888
As soon as I got inside...

1541
00:53:40,889 --> 00:53:42,535
(He came out in 1 second.)

1542
00:53:43,759 --> 00:53:45,459
Hello.

1543
00:53:45,460 --> 00:53:47,559
I almost died of laughter.

1544
00:53:47,560 --> 00:53:50,205
He's intense. He didn't laugh.

1545
00:53:51,330 --> 00:53:52,428
I was shocked.

1546
00:53:52,429 --> 00:53:53,975
He's so intense.

1547
00:53:54,369 --> 00:53:55,669
- Have you been well? - Yes.

1548
00:53:55,670 --> 00:53:58,368
- It's been a very long time. - My brother Kwang Soo.

1549
00:53:58,369 --> 00:54:01,138
- As soon as I saw him... - He drove me nuts.

1550
00:54:01,139 --> 00:54:02,908
Even if I resisted in the beginning,

1551
00:54:02,909 --> 00:54:03,908
I wailed.

1552
00:54:03,909 --> 00:54:05,749
I would have collapsed at the student part.

1553
00:54:05,750 --> 00:54:06,825
(I would have collapsed at the student part.)

1554
00:54:08,119 --> 00:54:09,149
Thank you.

1555
00:54:09,150 --> 00:54:11,988
Kwang Soo failed, but Jong Kook succeeded.

1556
00:54:11,989 --> 00:54:14,595
- I'm relieved. - You passed. I'll give you a hint.

1557
00:54:15,020 --> 00:54:16,088
Thank you.

1558
00:54:16,089 --> 00:54:17,519
Great work.

1559
00:54:17,520 --> 00:54:20,359
He should have come first. You came before him.

1560
00:54:20,360 --> 00:54:22,175
(We would like to thank Ki Bum for helping despite his busy schedule.)

1561
00:54:23,130 --> 00:54:25,099
- Are they back? - Jong Kook.

1562
00:54:25,100 --> 00:54:26,405
- Wasn't that insane? - Hey.

1563
00:54:26,469 --> 00:54:27,729
I'm drained.

1564
00:54:27,730 --> 00:54:28,944
- Why? - Why are you drained?

1565
00:54:29,500 --> 00:54:30,499
For trying not to laugh.

1566
00:54:30,500 --> 00:54:32,039
- You didn't laugh? - I...

1567
00:54:32,040 --> 00:54:33,609
- You failed, right? - I did.

1568
00:54:33,610 --> 00:54:34,914
He did it.

1569
00:54:35,210 --> 00:54:36,885
How did you not laugh?

1570
00:54:37,110 --> 00:54:38,854
- It was really hard. - He held it in.

1571
00:54:39,110 --> 00:54:41,394
- How did you do it? - I can usually stop myself.

1572
00:54:41,549 --> 00:54:43,595
I almost cried this time.

1573
00:54:43,650 --> 00:54:47,118
I resisted until the end, but as soon as I opened the door...

1574
00:54:47,119 --> 00:54:48,988
(He collapsed as soon as he opened the door.)

1575
00:54:48,989 --> 00:54:51,528
As soon as he opened the door, he rolled out.

1576
00:54:51,529 --> 00:54:53,265
(It was like a laughing gas chamber.)

1577
00:54:53,429 --> 00:54:54,629
Give us a hint.

1578
00:54:54,630 --> 00:54:56,729
I'll give you a hint.

1579
00:54:56,730 --> 00:55:00,129
I'll give it to you during the final judgment.

1580
00:55:00,130 --> 00:55:01,198
It's a decisive hint.

1581
00:55:01,199 --> 00:55:02,539
We know this now.

1582
00:55:02,540 --> 00:55:04,539
Jong Kook succeeded,

1583
00:55:04,540 --> 00:55:06,008
so he's not the bio-terrorist.

1584
00:55:06,009 --> 00:55:07,008
- Right. - He can't be.

1585
00:55:07,009 --> 00:55:08,479
It can be you.

1586
00:55:08,480 --> 00:55:10,008
- This is a hint. - It is.

1587
00:55:10,009 --> 00:55:13,155
It's a hint, so it can't be me.

1588
00:55:13,310 --> 00:55:15,349
I personally think it's 1 of these 3.

1589
00:55:15,350 --> 00:55:17,548
I went with Jong Kook, and I don't think it's him.

1590
00:55:17,549 --> 00:55:18,618
Why can't it be you?

1591
00:55:18,619 --> 00:55:19,725
Why is it not you?

1592
00:55:19,750 --> 00:55:21,258
- Exactly. - Your personal thoughts?

1593
00:55:21,259 --> 00:55:24,829
He resisted but laughed in the end. If I were him,

1594
00:55:24,830 --> 00:55:26,559
I wouldn't have been able to stop myself either.

1595
00:55:26,560 --> 00:55:28,975
I actually peed myself.

1596
00:55:29,460 --> 00:55:30,829
I'm serious. As soon as I saw him.

1597
00:55:30,830 --> 00:55:32,129
Weren't you startled?

1598
00:55:32,130 --> 00:55:33,198
(The bio-terrorist's identity is still unclear.)

1599
00:55:33,199 --> 00:55:35,769
Don't forget. You have to finish everything by 6 p.m.

1600
00:55:35,770 --> 00:55:37,198
- We have to do an indoor activity. - Indoor activity.

1601
00:55:37,199 --> 00:55:38,638
What time is it? It's past 2 p.m.

1602
00:55:38,639 --> 00:55:41,039
After the indoor activity, we have to get dessert.

1603
00:55:41,040 --> 00:55:42,579
- A quiz. - Let's do a quiz.

1604
00:55:42,580 --> 00:55:44,008
- In teams. - Let's do that.

1605
00:55:44,009 --> 00:55:46,579
The losing team has to do the next mission.

1606
00:55:46,580 --> 00:55:47,649
Right.

1607
00:55:47,650 --> 00:55:49,919
The zombies have to be among us too.

1608
00:55:49,920 --> 00:55:52,718
Let's have Jae Seok and Seok Jin's teams.

1609
00:55:52,719 --> 00:55:53,718
- Sure. - Okay.

1610
00:55:53,719 --> 00:55:55,019
Do rock-paper-scissors. Pick your teammates.

1611
00:55:55,020 --> 00:55:57,318
The infected members can't go even if they lose.

1612
00:55:57,319 --> 00:55:58,765
We can't go.

1613
00:55:59,089 --> 00:56:00,564
- That's true. <i>- Rock-paper-scissors</i>

1614
00:56:00,960 --> 00:56:02,229
(Seok Jin wins.)

1615
00:56:02,230 --> 00:56:03,405
Pick one person.

1616
00:56:04,330 --> 00:56:05,499
Jong Kook.

1617
00:56:05,500 --> 00:56:06,675
<i>- Rock-paper-scissors - Rock-paper-scissors</i>

1618
00:56:07,029 --> 00:56:08,838
(Jae Seok has to pick one person.)

1619
00:56:08,839 --> 00:56:10,575
Hey!

1620
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:12,908
(So Min bites his name tag.)

1621
00:56:12,909 --> 00:56:14,838
Oh, my goodness. Look at her.

1622
00:56:14,839 --> 00:56:17,678
- Goodness. - She almost had it.

1623
00:56:17,679 --> 00:56:19,609
- She almost had it. - Oh, gosh.

1624
00:56:19,610 --> 00:56:21,548
- Jae Seok, did you see me? - Goodness.

1625
00:56:21,549 --> 00:56:24,124
Jae Seok. Jae Seok!

1626
00:56:24,520 --> 00:56:26,995
Hey, hold on.

1627
00:56:27,119 --> 00:56:28,995
You could have ripped off his name tag.

1628
00:56:29,719 --> 00:56:31,388
Kwang Soo came pretty late.

1629
00:56:31,389 --> 00:56:32,729
No, Jong Kook.

1630
00:56:32,730 --> 00:56:33,829
- Really? - No.

1631
00:56:33,830 --> 00:56:35,528
- I thought he was out. - If I were the bio-terrorist,

1632
00:56:35,529 --> 00:56:37,559
I wouldn't have blocked her with my body.

1633
00:56:37,560 --> 00:56:39,368
- Kwang Soo, that was... - Hey, you.

1634
00:56:39,369 --> 00:56:40,705
(The suspicion grows.)

1635
00:56:40,770 --> 00:56:42,539
(Team Seok Jin: Jong Kook, So Min, Kwang Soo)

1636
00:56:42,540 --> 00:56:44,575
(Team Jae Seok: Haha, Ji Hyo, Se Chan)

1637
00:56:45,369 --> 00:56:47,039
Pick one person from each team.

1638
00:56:47,040 --> 00:56:48,209
So Min.

1639
00:56:48,210 --> 00:56:49,638
- Me? - Is it So Min?

1640
00:56:49,639 --> 00:56:51,984
- Let's do Ji Hyo then. - It's Ji Hyo.

1641
00:56:52,679 --> 00:56:54,479
Good luck!

1642
00:56:54,480 --> 00:56:56,055
Good luck, So Min.

1643
00:56:56,179 --> 00:56:57,618
Here's the question.

1644
00:56:57,619 --> 00:57:00,448
A farmer with 20 bananas sold all but 7 bananas.

1645
00:57:00,449 --> 00:57:01,758
How many does he have left?

1646
00:57:01,759 --> 00:57:03,318
Let me answer.

1647
00:57:03,319 --> 00:57:06,604
(She raised her hand as soon as she heard the question.)

1648
00:57:06,659 --> 00:57:07,729
18.

1649
00:57:07,730 --> 00:57:09,374
- Incorrect. - No.

1650
00:57:09,929 --> 00:57:11,544
20 and 7.

1651
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:13,104
13.

1652
00:57:13,330 --> 00:57:15,399
- Incorrect. - What's the question?

1653
00:57:15,400 --> 00:57:17,738
- What's the question? - Let me repeat the question.

1654
00:57:17,739 --> 00:57:20,309
A farmer with 20 bananas sold all but 7 bananas.

1655
00:57:20,310 --> 00:57:21,309
How many does he have left?

1656
00:57:21,310 --> 00:57:22,939
- Let me answer. - Let me answer. 13.

1657
00:57:22,940 --> 00:57:24,908
- Incorrect. - Let me answer. Seven.

1658
00:57:24,909 --> 00:57:27,408
- Correct. - It's seven, Ji Hyo.

1659
00:57:27,409 --> 00:57:29,024
(It's 7, Ji Hyo.)

1660
00:57:29,520 --> 00:57:30,655
Right.

1661
00:57:30,719 --> 00:57:31,919
- What did he say? - It's a play-on-words.

1662
00:57:31,920 --> 00:57:34,894
He sold all but seven.

1663
00:57:35,089 --> 00:57:36,734
That's confusing.

1664
00:57:37,119 --> 00:57:38,758
- Go, Se Chan. - Okay.

1665
00:57:38,759 --> 00:57:39,829
Kwang Soo.

1666
00:57:39,830 --> 00:57:41,329
This is the final match.

1667
00:57:41,330 --> 00:57:42,774
I must win.

1668
00:57:43,460 --> 00:57:45,368
- He sold all but seven. - It's a play-on-words.

1669
00:57:45,369 --> 00:57:46,669
I'll use all the knowledge I have.

1670
00:57:46,670 --> 00:57:47,669
Good luck!

1671
00:57:47,670 --> 00:57:48,745
(He's the rising power of ignorance.)

1672
00:57:48,940 --> 00:57:50,499
- Se Chan doesn't know anything. - I'm not kidding.

1673
00:57:50,500 --> 00:57:51,669
Don't worry.

1674
00:57:51,670 --> 00:57:53,468
- It's Se Chan. - It's unpleasant for me to hear it.

1675
00:57:53,469 --> 00:57:55,908
- I know. - Your pride will crumble...

1676
00:57:55,909 --> 00:57:57,914
- if you lose to him. - Here's the question.

1677
00:57:58,150 --> 00:57:59,885
- In the solar system... - What?

1678
00:58:00,049 --> 00:58:01,419
- Solar system. - Solar system?

1679
00:58:01,420 --> 00:58:03,249
- In the solar system... - You know what it is, right?

1680
00:58:03,250 --> 00:58:04,988
On the rooftop,

1681
00:58:04,989 --> 00:58:05,988
(He's flustered times 100.)

1682
00:58:05,989 --> 00:58:08,359
- there are boards. - Those are solar panels, you punk.

1683
00:58:08,360 --> 00:58:09,388
Hey.

1684
00:58:09,389 --> 00:58:11,928
(He's annoyed.)

1685
00:58:11,929 --> 00:58:13,388
- Hey! - Oh, gosh.

1686
00:58:13,389 --> 00:58:14,734
He's on our team.

1687
00:58:15,259 --> 00:58:17,129
- Mars and Jupiter? - Those are solar panels.

1688
00:58:17,130 --> 00:58:18,269
- Mars and Jupiter. - Good luck!

1689
00:58:18,270 --> 00:58:19,829
I got this.

1690
00:58:19,830 --> 00:58:21,999
What am I doing sitting here?

1691
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:23,238
Here's the question.

1692
00:58:23,239 --> 00:58:26,338
A submarine made out of lead can hold 60 people.

1693
00:58:26,339 --> 00:58:29,209
30 men and 29 women got on it,

1694
00:58:29,210 --> 00:58:30,838
but it sank. Why?

1695
00:58:30,839 --> 00:58:31,925
Let me answer.

1696
00:58:32,679 --> 00:58:33,908
They were too heavy.

1697
00:58:33,909 --> 00:58:35,118
(They were too heavy.)

1698
00:58:35,119 --> 00:58:36,519
- Incorrect. - Let me answer.

1699
00:58:36,520 --> 00:58:39,218
It's made out of lead, so it sinks. Because it's lead?

1700
00:58:39,219 --> 00:58:40,318
(It's lead, so it sinks. Because it's lead?)

1701
00:58:40,319 --> 00:58:41,818
- Incorrect. - What?

1702
00:58:41,819 --> 00:58:42,894
It's not correct?

1703
00:58:43,520 --> 00:58:44,618
Let me answer.

1704
00:58:44,619 --> 00:58:48,198
When you add 30 to 29, it's 59,

1705
00:58:48,199 --> 00:58:49,504
but the lead is 60.

1706
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:51,405
What are you saying?

1707
00:58:51,969 --> 00:58:53,829
- Incorrect. - I'm not sure either.

1708
00:58:53,830 --> 00:58:56,439
- I don't get it. - 30 men and 29 women?

1709
00:58:56,440 --> 00:58:58,515
- Let me repeat the question. - Okay.

1710
00:58:58,540 --> 00:59:01,209
- I got it. - A submarine made out of lead...

1711
00:59:01,210 --> 00:59:02,539
can hold 60 people. 30 men and 29 women got on it,

1712
00:59:02,540 --> 00:59:04,379
- but it sank. - It's a submarine, so it sinks.

1713
00:59:04,380 --> 00:59:05,579
Why?

1714
00:59:05,580 --> 00:59:06,579
(Right, it's a submarine.)

1715
00:59:06,580 --> 00:59:07,655
That's true.

1716
00:59:08,449 --> 00:59:09,749
That's right.

1717
00:59:09,750 --> 00:59:10,879
- Let me answer. - Yes?

1718
00:59:10,880 --> 00:59:12,088
One woman is missing.

1719
00:59:12,089 --> 00:59:13,164
Incorrect.

1720
00:59:13,920 --> 00:59:15,718
This is really...

1721
00:59:15,719 --> 00:59:16,964
Let me answer.

1722
00:59:17,489 --> 00:59:18,888
There was a pregnant woman.

1723
00:59:18,889 --> 00:59:20,329
- Incorrect. - No.

1724
00:59:20,330 --> 00:59:21,928
- You're wrong. - No. Don't you get it?

1725
00:59:21,929 --> 00:59:23,305
Think about it carefully.

1726
00:59:23,330 --> 00:59:26,575
Hey, listen to the question.

1727
00:59:27,330 --> 00:59:29,338
Someone didn't wear any lead.

1728
00:59:29,339 --> 00:59:31,769
Hey!

1729
00:59:31,770 --> 00:59:33,738
(He says whatever.)

1730
00:59:33,739 --> 00:59:35,238
So...

1731
00:59:35,239 --> 00:59:36,385
- So... - It's because...

1732
00:59:36,739 --> 00:59:38,749
The correct answer is that it was a submarine.

1733
00:59:38,750 --> 00:59:40,778
- Goodness. - It's a lead submarine.

1734
00:59:40,779 --> 00:59:42,979
- It's a submarine. - Submarines sink.

1735
00:59:42,980 --> 00:59:45,488
He said it's a submarine. They sink.

1736
00:59:45,489 --> 00:59:47,818
- Don't give them these questions. - I thought I had to use knowledge.

1737
00:59:47,819 --> 00:59:48,988
I get it now.

1738
00:59:48,989 --> 00:59:50,559
Are you verifying how stupid you are?

1739
00:59:50,560 --> 00:59:52,104
He said one person is pregnant.

1740
00:59:52,889 --> 00:59:54,164
(He's embarrassed.)

1741
00:59:54,290 --> 00:59:55,604
Here's the question.

1742
00:59:55,630 --> 00:59:59,428
This paper is used to see if a solution is acidic or basic.

1743
00:59:59,429 --> 01:00:02,039
It turns red for acidic solutions and turns blue for basic solutions.

1744
01:00:02,040 --> 01:00:03,399
Don't you know this?

1745
01:00:03,400 --> 01:00:05,468
- This is so easy. - They should know.

1746
01:00:05,469 --> 01:00:06,544
Let me answer.

1747
01:00:07,139 --> 01:00:10,285
- Pita... - This is so easy.

1748
01:00:10,380 --> 01:00:12,249
- Go. - Spoize?

1749
01:00:12,250 --> 01:00:14,349
What is it? Spo...

1750
01:00:14,350 --> 01:00:15,579
Spoize?

1751
01:00:15,580 --> 01:00:17,194
No.

1752
01:00:17,750 --> 01:00:20,064
It's something like that.

1753
01:00:20,420 --> 01:00:23,164
- Silence. - The one that changes colors.

1754
01:00:23,259 --> 01:00:24,888
- Here's a hint. - A hint?

1755
01:00:24,889 --> 01:00:26,265
- It has "s" in it. - Hey.

1756
01:00:26,489 --> 01:00:28,528
- It has four characters. - "S" is at the end.

1757
01:00:28,529 --> 01:00:30,175
Four characters.

1758
01:00:31,230 --> 01:00:32,769
He's never heard of it.

1759
01:00:32,770 --> 01:00:34,229
Here's another hint.

1760
01:00:34,230 --> 01:00:35,838
- The first character is... - You have to get it.

1761
01:00:35,839 --> 01:00:37,044
- "li". - Let me answer!

1762
01:00:37,540 --> 01:00:39,008
(He yelled out as soon as heard the hint.)

1763
01:00:39,009 --> 01:00:40,568
- He doesn't know. - He doesn't.

1764
01:00:40,569 --> 01:00:43,055
- He doesn't? - It's "li".

1765
01:00:43,239 --> 01:00:44,508
- It starts with that. - "Li".

1766
01:00:44,509 --> 01:00:46,048
- It ends with "s". - Four characters. "S".

1767
01:00:46,049 --> 01:00:48,278
- 4 characters. You only need 2. - "Li", blank, blank, and "s".

1768
01:00:48,279 --> 01:00:49,548
- "Li", blank, blank, and "s". - Kleenex.

1769
01:00:49,549 --> 01:00:52,294
(Kleenex)

1770
01:00:53,719 --> 01:00:55,088
Kleenex? Do you think I'm stupid?

1771
01:00:55,089 --> 01:00:57,495
(Kleenex? Do you think I'm stupid?)

1772
01:00:59,159 --> 01:01:00,528
I am annoyed.

1773
01:01:00,529 --> 01:01:02,675
(I am not stupid.)

1774
01:01:02,960 --> 01:01:05,274
- I don't think this is the answer. - Give it a try.

1775
01:01:05,369 --> 01:01:06,475
Let me answer.

1776
01:01:06,500 --> 01:01:08,374
Rimowa.

1777
01:01:08,900 --> 01:01:10,214
Rimowa!

1778
01:01:10,639 --> 01:01:12,785
- That's a luggage brand. - That's a luggage brand.

1779
01:01:12,810 --> 01:01:14,609
Rimowa is a luggage brand.

1780
01:01:14,610 --> 01:01:17,484
Adding "s" at the end would make Rimowas.

1781
01:01:18,449 --> 01:01:20,825
- I will give you the third letter. - Okay.

1782
01:01:20,909 --> 01:01:22,095
The third letter is...

1783
01:01:22,750 --> 01:01:23,778
- M. - M.

1784
01:01:23,779 --> 01:01:25,064
- So you have L, blank, M, and S. - You have everything.

1785
01:01:25,520 --> 01:01:28,535
Let me answer. Is it "Litmus"?

1786
01:01:28,920 --> 01:01:29,919
Correct.

1787
01:01:29,920 --> 01:01:32,428
(Litmus is correct.)

1788
01:01:32,429 --> 01:01:34,588
- I did it! - You fool!

1789
01:01:34,589 --> 01:01:35,829
(I won!)

1790
01:01:35,830 --> 01:01:37,428
- For goodness' sake. - For goodness' sake.

1791
01:01:37,429 --> 01:01:38,868
- For goodness' sake. - You fool!

1792
01:01:38,869 --> 01:01:39,968
(I can't believe I lost to Se Chan.)

1793
01:01:39,969 --> 01:01:41,175
I did it!

1794
01:01:41,199 --> 01:01:42,338
- All right. - I can't believe you.

1795
01:01:42,339 --> 01:01:44,198
I brought that up from the corner of my brain.

1796
01:01:44,199 --> 01:01:46,414
- The score is 1 to 1. - Litmus.

1797
01:01:46,440 --> 01:01:47,544
1 to 1.

1798
01:01:48,040 --> 01:01:49,354
Let's have a group match.

1799
01:01:49,380 --> 01:01:50,908
- Okay. Let's have a group match. - It's time for a group match.

1800
01:01:50,909 --> 01:01:53,055
- Okay. Okay. - A group match.

1801
01:01:53,580 --> 01:01:55,095
Let's have a quiz on four-character idioms.

1802
01:01:55,219 --> 01:01:57,854
If you give us the meaning of the idiom,

1803
01:01:57,980 --> 01:01:59,964
- we will say the four characters. - A character each.

1804
01:01:59,989 --> 01:02:01,325
The order will be important.

1805
01:02:01,819 --> 01:02:03,234
Here comes the question.

1806
01:02:03,319 --> 01:02:05,729
The literal meaning of the idiom is, "A mantis blocks a wagon."

1807
01:02:05,730 --> 01:02:09,374
It depicts the weak who foolishly challenges the strong.

1808
01:02:09,900 --> 01:02:11,198
Let me answer. "Sa".

1809
01:02:11,199 --> 01:02:12,444
- Incorrect. - Let me answer. "Dang".

1810
01:02:14,130 --> 01:02:15,338
- Is it right? - It must be right.

1811
01:02:15,339 --> 01:02:16,414
It's right!

1812
01:02:16,569 --> 01:02:17,868
- Really? - Is "Dang" correct?

1813
01:02:17,869 --> 01:02:19,609
- Jae Seok. - "Dang".

1814
01:02:19,610 --> 01:02:20,685
"Rang".

1815
01:02:20,710 --> 01:02:21,785
"Dang" and "Rang".

1816
01:02:22,139 --> 01:02:23,914
- 3, 2... - "Dang", "Rang"...

1817
01:02:24,580 --> 01:02:26,385
- "Kwon". - Incorrect.

1818
01:02:27,449 --> 01:02:29,754
("Kwon" makes no sense.)

1819
01:02:30,020 --> 01:02:31,155
Let me answer.

1820
01:02:31,690 --> 01:02:33,464
- "Dang". - "Rang".

1821
01:02:33,619 --> 01:02:34,888
- "Bang". - Incorrect.

1822
01:02:34,889 --> 01:02:35,888
- "Dang". - "Rang".

1823
01:02:35,889 --> 01:02:36,888
- "Geo". - "Ji".

1824
01:02:36,889 --> 01:02:38,964
- Incorrect. - "Dangranggeoji".

1825
01:02:39,089 --> 01:02:40,729
- "Geo" - Incorrect.

1826
01:02:40,730 --> 01:02:41,729
- "Dang". - "Rang".

1827
01:02:41,730 --> 01:02:42,834
"Geo".

1828
01:02:43,529 --> 01:02:44,935
- Boom! - Incorrect.

1829
01:02:46,199 --> 01:02:47,968
(She uses a palm blast.)

1830
01:02:47,969 --> 01:02:49,738
What character could there be?

1831
01:02:49,739 --> 01:02:50,845
- I will give you a hint. - Okay.

1832
01:02:51,400 --> 01:02:52,508
The character starts with C.

1833
01:02:52,509 --> 01:02:54,015
- C? - C.

1834
01:02:54,509 --> 01:02:55,508
- "Dang". - "Rang".

1835
01:02:55,509 --> 01:02:56,685
"Geo".

1836
01:02:56,980 --> 01:02:58,484
- "Cha". - Incorrect.

1837
01:02:58,610 --> 01:02:59,609
- "Chu". - Incorrect.

1838
01:02:59,610 --> 01:03:00,609
- "Chang". - "Cho".

1839
01:03:00,610 --> 01:03:01,825
- "Cheon". - "Cheo".

1840
01:03:01,850 --> 01:03:02,979
- "Chang". - Incorrect.

1841
01:03:02,980 --> 01:03:04,048
No, no.

1842
01:03:04,049 --> 01:03:05,265
I will give you the last hint.

1843
01:03:06,219 --> 01:03:07,595
- Okay. - The last character...

1844
01:03:08,560 --> 01:03:09,765
is right in front of your eyes.

1845
01:03:11,159 --> 01:03:12,405
Right in front of our eyes? Look.

1846
01:03:12,560 --> 01:03:13,734
It's right in front of our eyes.

1847
01:03:13,759 --> 01:03:15,099
- Right in front of our eyes? - That's right.

1848
01:03:15,100 --> 01:03:16,405
Camera.

1849
01:03:16,429 --> 01:03:18,705
- Camera, producer, writer... - Hey!

1850
01:03:19,069 --> 01:03:20,099
Right in front of our eyes?

1851
01:03:20,100 --> 01:03:21,698
(They scan the scene in front of them.)

1852
01:03:21,699 --> 01:03:23,845
- Camera, producer, writer... - Hey!

1853
01:03:25,369 --> 01:03:27,214
Hey! There is Chul Min.

1854
01:03:27,239 --> 01:03:28,238
- "Dang". - "Dang".

1855
01:03:28,239 --> 01:03:29,238
- "Dang". - "Rang".

1856
01:03:29,239 --> 01:03:30,238
- "Geo". - "Chul".

1857
01:03:30,239 --> 01:03:31,385
Correct.

1858
01:03:32,049 --> 01:03:34,149
(Dangranggeochul is correct.)

1859
01:03:34,150 --> 01:03:35,649
I see.

1860
01:03:35,650 --> 01:03:36,649
I have never heard of that before.

1861
01:03:36,650 --> 01:03:39,718
- I forgot Chul Min's name. - I've never heard of that before.

1862
01:03:39,719 --> 01:03:40,925
I am sorry,

1863
01:03:41,119 --> 01:03:43,995
but this is making us look stupid. Let's play something else.

1864
01:03:45,460 --> 01:03:47,789
Seriously. This is making us look stupid.

1865
01:03:47,790 --> 01:03:49,834
We were yelling out "Cha", "Chya", "Cho", and "Chyo".

1866
01:03:51,000 --> 01:03:52,999
- All right. - Do you want one more question?

1867
01:03:53,000 --> 01:03:54,405
- Go ahead. - One more question.

1868
01:03:54,469 --> 01:03:55,539
Here it comes.

1869
01:03:55,540 --> 01:03:56,539
(The last question)

1870
01:03:56,540 --> 01:03:58,539
The literal meaning is "Unable to forget night and day".

1871
01:03:58,540 --> 01:04:00,209
This idiom depicts the situation where one can't fall sleep...

1872
01:04:00,210 --> 01:04:02,939
due to longing or too many thoughts and worries.

1873
01:04:02,940 --> 01:04:04,178
(The answer is Ohmaebulmang.)

1874
01:04:04,179 --> 01:04:05,685
Say "Let me answer" first.

1875
01:04:06,179 --> 01:04:07,885
(Ji Hyo, here is the answer.)

1876
01:04:08,110 --> 01:04:09,225
Let me answer.

1877
01:04:09,420 --> 01:04:10,725
- "Son". - For goodness' sake!

1878
01:04:11,250 --> 01:04:12,425
(Wasn't that what you told me?)

1879
01:04:12,690 --> 01:04:13,794
Let me answer.

1880
01:04:13,889 --> 01:04:14,995
- "Bi". - Incorrect.

1881
01:04:16,420 --> 01:04:17,559
(Ji Hyo, look again.)

1882
01:04:17,560 --> 01:04:18,664
(Oh, I get it now!)

1883
01:04:18,889 --> 01:04:20,028
Let me answer. "Deung".

1884
01:04:20,029 --> 01:04:21,959
- For goodness' sake. - Come on!

1885
01:04:21,960 --> 01:04:24,374
(Is "Deung" incorrect as well?)

1886
01:04:25,600 --> 01:04:27,798
(O)

1887
01:04:27,799 --> 01:04:28,868
(A?)

1888
01:04:28,869 --> 01:04:30,044
Let me answer.

1889
01:04:30,170 --> 01:04:31,245
- "Oh". - That's right!

1890
01:04:31,440 --> 01:04:32,515
"Mae".

1891
01:04:33,040 --> 01:04:34,115
"Bul".

1892
01:04:34,540 --> 01:04:35,539
"Geo".

1893
01:04:35,540 --> 01:04:36,638
("Geo"?)

1894
01:04:36,639 --> 01:04:38,115
- Incorrect. - Come on!

1895
01:04:38,380 --> 01:04:39,778
- "Geo". - Incorrect.

1896
01:04:39,779 --> 01:04:40,849
Come on!

1897
01:04:40,850 --> 01:04:42,624
(He ruined it again.)

1898
01:04:43,150 --> 01:04:44,649
Let me answer. "Oh".

1899
01:04:44,650 --> 01:04:45,825
"Mae".

1900
01:04:46,250 --> 01:04:47,618
- "Bul". - "Mang".

1901
01:04:47,619 --> 01:04:49,064
Okay!

1902
01:04:49,659 --> 01:04:50,818
- Correct. - Okay.

1903
01:04:50,819 --> 01:04:52,059
(Ohmaebulmang is correct.)

1904
01:04:52,060 --> 01:04:54,464
- "Ohmaebulgeo"! - "Ohmaebulgeo"!

1905
01:04:54,630 --> 01:04:56,935
- I am sorry. - What's "Ohmaebulgeo"?

1906
01:04:57,460 --> 01:04:58,774
It was "Ohmaebulmang".

1907
01:05:00,569 --> 01:05:02,468
When I pointed at Ji Hyo's hand,

1908
01:05:02,469 --> 01:05:03,714
she said,

1909
01:05:03,839 --> 01:05:05,075
"Son".

1910
01:05:05,869 --> 01:05:06,908
(She is the type to look at the tree, not the forest.)

1911
01:05:06,909 --> 01:05:08,185
When I pointed again, she said,

1912
01:05:08,369 --> 01:05:09,515
"Deung".

1913
01:05:09,540 --> 01:05:11,354
- Was that what it was? - Yes.

1914
01:05:11,580 --> 01:05:12,685
Ji Hyo.

1915
01:05:12,750 --> 01:05:15,149
- The score is... - It's tied.

1916
01:05:15,150 --> 01:05:16,455
- tied. - One last question.

1917
01:05:16,679 --> 01:05:18,149
- One last question. - Let's go.

1918
01:05:18,150 --> 01:05:19,249
One last question.

1919
01:05:19,250 --> 01:05:20,425
Here comes the question.

1920
01:05:20,949 --> 01:05:22,318
The literal meaning is...

1921
01:05:22,319 --> 01:05:23,919
"Lying on firewood and swallowing bile".

1922
01:05:23,920 --> 01:05:26,258
It's a four-character idiom about...

1923
01:05:26,259 --> 01:05:28,575
enduring all kinds of hardships to take revenge.

1924
01:05:28,600 --> 01:05:30,859
(The answer is Washinsangdam.)

1925
01:05:30,860 --> 01:05:32,329
- Let me answer. - I know the answer.

1926
01:05:32,330 --> 01:05:33,669
- Go ahead. - "Wa".

1927
01:05:33,670 --> 01:05:34,944
- That's right. - "Wa".

1928
01:05:36,299 --> 01:05:38,039
- Incorrect. - Hey!

1929
01:05:38,040 --> 01:05:39,414
(What a surprise.)

1930
01:05:39,770 --> 01:05:41,039
Think of bile.

1931
01:05:41,040 --> 01:05:42,138
"Swallowing bile"?

1932
01:05:42,139 --> 01:05:43,379
Think of bile.

1933
01:05:43,380 --> 01:05:45,249
- Hurry up. - Think of bile.

1934
01:05:45,250 --> 01:05:46,955
- "Wa". - "Shin".

1935
01:05:47,250 --> 01:05:48,455
- "Bile". - Incorrect.

1936
01:05:49,580 --> 01:05:50,579
What comes next?

1937
01:05:50,580 --> 01:05:51,649
(Team Seok Jin fails.)

1938
01:05:51,650 --> 01:05:53,564
- Go ahead. - Let me answer. "Wa".

1939
01:05:53,790 --> 01:05:55,394
- "Shin". - "Sang".

1940
01:05:55,690 --> 01:05:56,919
- "Gan". - Incorrect.

1941
01:05:56,920 --> 01:05:59,334
("Washinsanggan"?)

1942
01:05:59,730 --> 01:06:01,464
What even is "Washinsanggan"?

1943
01:06:01,560 --> 01:06:03,298
- Bile. - What's the answer?

1944
01:06:03,299 --> 01:06:04,975
(The mention of bile threw him off.)

1945
01:06:05,869 --> 01:06:07,468
Again. Again.

1946
01:06:07,469 --> 01:06:08,999
(Their livers hurt from laughing.)

1947
01:06:09,000 --> 01:06:10,198
- What even is "Washinsanggan"? - Let's go.

1948
01:06:10,199 --> 01:06:11,238
All right.

1949
01:06:11,239 --> 01:06:12,944
- Think of something that pours out. - Think of bile.

1950
01:06:13,009 --> 01:06:15,144
Think of bile.

1951
01:06:15,210 --> 01:06:16,738
- "Wa". - "Shin".

1952
01:06:16,739 --> 01:06:17,809
"Sang".

1953
01:06:17,810 --> 01:06:18,908
"Juice".

1954
01:06:18,909 --> 01:06:20,925
("Washinsangjuice"!)

1955
01:06:21,810 --> 01:06:23,649
- What even is... - All right.

1956
01:06:23,650 --> 01:06:25,664
- Let me answer. - We won't tell her.

1957
01:06:25,750 --> 01:06:26,865
What's bile?

1958
01:06:27,250 --> 01:06:29,359
Does it come from the liver?

1959
01:06:29,360 --> 01:06:30,464
Let's go.

1960
01:06:30,759 --> 01:06:31,789
- "Wa". - Don't tell her.

1961
01:06:31,790 --> 01:06:32,865
- "Shin". - We didn't tell her.

1962
01:06:33,159 --> 01:06:34,405
"Sang".

1963
01:06:34,929 --> 01:06:36,734
- Hold on. - Leave him be.

1964
01:06:36,960 --> 01:06:38,868
- Let him try. - 5, 4...

1965
01:06:38,869 --> 01:06:41,805
(Se Chan points to his gallbladder.)

1966
01:06:42,100 --> 01:06:44,745
(Will Se Chan be able to complete the answer?)

1967
01:06:45,869 --> 01:06:46,908
"Lung".

1968
01:06:46,909 --> 01:06:48,144
(Take this.)

1969
01:06:48,310 --> 01:06:50,885
(No one imagined such a lousy answer.)

1970
01:06:51,380 --> 01:06:52,749
He drives me insane.

1971
01:06:52,750 --> 01:06:55,024
You will name all the organs at this rate.

1972
01:06:56,179 --> 01:06:57,178
Go.

1973
01:06:57,179 --> 01:06:58,479
- "Wa". - "Shin".

1974
01:06:58,480 --> 01:07:00,419
- "Sang". - "Dam".

1975
01:07:00,420 --> 01:07:03,365
("Washinsangdam")

1976
01:07:03,989 --> 01:07:05,189
- Correct. - Okay!

1977
01:07:05,190 --> 01:07:06,258
How did you know?

1978
01:07:06,259 --> 01:07:07,658
- "Dam" is a character for "Bile". - That's it.

1979
01:07:07,659 --> 01:07:08,798
(The final score is 2 to 3.)

1980
01:07:08,799 --> 01:07:11,999
Thus, Seok Jin, Jong Kook, Kwang Soo, and So Min's team wins.

1981
01:07:12,000 --> 01:07:13,104
Yes!

1982
01:07:14,130 --> 01:07:16,175
To be honest,

1983
01:07:16,569 --> 01:07:17,939
I was startled two times.

1984
01:07:17,940 --> 01:07:19,845
The first time was when I said "Wa" and Ji Hyo said "Wa".

1985
01:07:20,270 --> 01:07:21,984
The second time was when Se Chan said "Gan".

1986
01:07:22,210 --> 01:07:23,385
"Washinsanggan".

1987
01:07:23,839 --> 01:07:24,939
"Wawasanggan".

1988
01:07:24,940 --> 01:07:25,948
(It was a hilarious match.)

1989
01:07:25,949 --> 01:07:27,285
- Unbelievable. - "Wa" and "Wa".

1990
01:07:27,350 --> 01:07:28,448
Let's play rock-paper-scissors.

1991
01:07:28,449 --> 01:07:29,548
Rock-paper-scissors.

1992
01:07:29,549 --> 01:07:30,725
<i>- Rock-paper-scissors - Rock-paper-scissors</i>

1993
01:07:31,819 --> 01:07:32,919
Okay.

1994
01:07:32,920 --> 01:07:34,448
- You don't get to participate. - You don't get to participate.

1995
01:07:34,449 --> 01:07:35,559
Oh, I am a zombie.

1996
01:07:35,560 --> 01:07:36,618
- Okay. - Rock-paper-scissors.

1997
01:07:36,619 --> 01:07:38,765
<i>Rock-paper-scissors Rock-paper-scissors</i>

1998
01:07:39,529 --> 01:07:40,629
(Jae Seok will go out to buy snacks!)

1999
01:07:40,630 --> 01:07:41,689
Jae Seok.

2000
01:07:41,690 --> 01:07:42,698
Is it Jae Seok?

2001
01:07:42,699 --> 01:07:44,734
- He was the most suspicious anyway. - Okay.

2002
01:07:47,529 --> 01:07:48,738
I will be back.

2003
01:07:48,739 --> 01:07:49,814
Bye.

2004
01:07:49,940 --> 01:07:51,468
- Good luck. - Good luck.

2005
01:07:51,469 --> 01:07:53,084
(Jae Seok leaves the house by himself.)

2006
01:07:53,810 --> 01:07:56,209
- Humans should sit together. - That's right.

2007
01:07:56,210 --> 01:07:58,515
- Come on. Let's mingle. - We should mingle.

2008
01:07:58,540 --> 01:08:00,124
Mingle, my foot!

2009
01:08:00,150 --> 01:08:01,178
This isn't a group date.

2010
01:08:01,179 --> 01:08:02,349
(This isn't a group date.)

2011
01:08:02,350 --> 01:08:03,479
Send the zombies away.

2012
01:08:03,480 --> 01:08:05,789
- Go down. Sit on the floor. - You could take off our name tags.

2013
01:08:05,790 --> 01:08:07,064
So Min, hurry up and sit on the floor.

2014
01:08:07,549 --> 01:08:08,919
- Sit on the floor. - Sit on the floor.

2015
01:08:08,920 --> 01:08:10,419
That's right. Sit on the floor and lean against the sofa.

2016
01:08:10,420 --> 01:08:11,865
Let's go up.

2017
01:08:12,029 --> 01:08:13,135
Se Chan.

2018
01:08:13,360 --> 01:08:15,575
You look like the fourth hitter.

2019
01:08:15,860 --> 01:08:17,559
- Seriously. - Really?

2020
01:08:17,560 --> 01:08:19,229
You look like the fourth hitter.

2021
01:08:19,230 --> 01:08:20,629
I knew someone like him back in school.

2022
01:08:20,630 --> 01:08:21,905
- Someone like me? - Yes.

2023
01:08:22,770 --> 01:08:25,214
If the bio-terrorist is in here,

2024
01:08:25,270 --> 01:08:26,709
he or she should give us zombies...

2025
01:08:26,710 --> 01:08:28,638
- a sign. - That's right.

2026
01:08:28,639 --> 01:08:29,979
I haven't received a sign.

2027
01:08:29,980 --> 01:08:32,209
- Don't disregard us. - At this rate, you will lose.

2028
01:08:32,210 --> 01:08:33,479
(Not even those who got infected know the bio-terrorist.)

2029
01:08:33,480 --> 01:08:34,784
At this rate, you will lose.

2030
01:08:35,549 --> 01:08:36,849
Is the bio-terrorist not in here?

2031
01:08:36,850 --> 01:08:38,494
Does that mean Jae Seok is the bio-terrorist?

2032
01:08:39,450 --> 01:08:41,989
(Jae Seok comes out of the house by himself.)

2033
01:08:41,990 --> 01:08:43,195
What is it?

2034
01:08:43,259 --> 01:08:46,529
Choose from Route 1 to 4.

2035
01:08:46,530 --> 01:08:47,659
Route Three.

2036
01:08:47,660 --> 01:08:49,404
Please check the phone for your mission.

2037
01:08:49,829 --> 01:08:51,128
For goodness' sake.

2038
01:08:51,129 --> 01:08:55,975
(Which mission did Jae Seok choose?)

2039
01:08:58,039 --> 01:08:59,214
What?

2040
01:08:59,240 --> 01:09:00,385
"Photos That Kill"?

2041
01:09:00,969 --> 01:09:03,479
This is a two-man mission,

2042
01:09:03,480 --> 01:09:06,508
so pick a member who will accompany you.

2043
01:09:06,509 --> 01:09:09,748
(Whom will Jae Seok choose?)

2044
01:09:09,749 --> 01:09:12,265
For the two-man mission, Jae Seok has chosen Haha.

2045
01:09:12,350 --> 01:09:13,388
Me?

2046
01:09:13,389 --> 01:09:14,624
I choose Haha.

2047
01:09:14,789 --> 01:09:15,888
See you later.

2048
01:09:15,889 --> 01:09:17,664
I might come back as a zombie.

2049
01:09:17,860 --> 01:09:19,435
I think he plans to turn me into a zombie.

2050
01:09:19,560 --> 01:09:21,428
If both of them become a zombie,

2051
01:09:21,429 --> 01:09:23,534
one of these three will be the bio-terrorist.

2052
01:09:24,200 --> 01:09:28,069
(Will Jae Seok and Haha be able to avoid the virus?)

2053
01:09:28,070 --> 01:09:29,239
(Taking a peek)

2054
01:09:29,240 --> 01:09:30,668
- Jae Seok. - What?

2055
01:09:30,669 --> 01:09:31,939
(Extremely nervous)

2056
01:09:31,940 --> 01:09:33,145
What's the mission?

2057
01:09:33,240 --> 01:09:34,638
- He is here. - All right.

2058
01:09:34,639 --> 01:09:37,114
This is a two-man mission,

2059
01:09:37,280 --> 01:09:38,909
Photos That Kill.

2060
01:09:38,910 --> 01:09:39,985
Photos That Kill.

2061
01:09:40,150 --> 01:09:43,078
You will go to a convenience store to buy snacks.

2062
01:09:43,079 --> 01:09:45,418
If you get less than three photos taken by the paparazzi...

2063
01:09:45,419 --> 01:09:47,689
which show your name tag,

2064
01:09:47,690 --> 01:09:49,288
or your face with either your eyes, nose, or mouth, you succeed.

2065
01:09:49,289 --> 01:09:51,059
(Get less than three photos taken by the paparazzi...)

2066
01:09:51,060 --> 01:09:52,864
(which show your name tag or eyes, nose, and mouth.)

2067
01:09:54,190 --> 01:09:55,975
- We can hide our faces, right? - Let's stand like this.

2068
01:09:56,499 --> 01:09:58,328
This pose will show our faces.

2069
01:09:58,329 --> 01:10:00,145
- It will show your face. - That's right.

2070
01:10:00,829 --> 01:10:02,074
We can do this.

2071
01:10:02,740 --> 01:10:04,399
We should walk...

2072
01:10:04,400 --> 01:10:05,668
like this.

2073
01:10:05,669 --> 01:10:07,208
(Hide your face with swagger like a hip-hop musician.)

2074
01:10:07,209 --> 01:10:08,369
Can we go now?

2075
01:10:08,370 --> 01:10:09,939
I picked you because you're the most suspicious.

2076
01:10:09,940 --> 01:10:12,525
- I am suspicious of you. - I am suspicious of you too.

2077
01:10:12,650 --> 01:10:14,548
- Don't be like that. - I am serious.

2078
01:10:14,549 --> 01:10:16,294
Why are you suspicious of me?

2079
01:10:16,480 --> 01:10:18,124
Today, you are...

2080
01:10:18,579 --> 01:10:20,048
too quiet.

2081
01:10:20,049 --> 01:10:23,034
(They set off suspicious of each other.)

2082
01:10:23,959 --> 01:10:25,119
(Clicking)

2083
01:10:25,120 --> 01:10:27,305
(I got you.)

2084
01:10:27,389 --> 01:10:29,928
(Are they paparazzi?)

2085
01:10:29,929 --> 01:10:31,099
(Clicking)

2086
01:10:31,100 --> 01:10:32,128
Hold on.

2087
01:10:32,129 --> 01:10:33,805
(Sir!)

2088
01:10:34,200 --> 01:10:35,229
Thank you.

2089
01:10:35,230 --> 01:10:36,739
(They soothe their hearts with a yogurt drink.)

2090
01:10:36,740 --> 01:10:38,699
(You didn't expect this, right?)

2091
01:10:38,700 --> 01:10:40,409
(My goodness!)

2092
01:10:40,410 --> 01:10:42,708
(Terrified)

2093
01:10:42,709 --> 01:10:45,239
(Is this how it's going to be?)

2094
01:10:45,240 --> 01:10:46,925
I don't know who the paparazzi are.

2095
01:10:46,950 --> 01:10:49,294
- Me neither. - There is no way of knowing.

2096
01:10:49,379 --> 01:10:50,895
I can't tell if they are just regular people...

2097
01:10:51,079 --> 01:10:52,288
- or the paparazzi. - My goodness!

2098
01:10:52,289 --> 01:10:53,425
What is it?

2099
01:10:54,249 --> 01:10:56,189
(I am a paparazzo.)

2100
01:10:56,190 --> 01:10:57,794
Are you really going to take photos so openly?

2101
01:10:58,389 --> 01:10:59,428
(Diligent)

2102
01:10:59,429 --> 01:11:00,529
Come on, stop following me.

2103
01:11:00,530 --> 01:11:01,758
I think they took a lot of pictures of you.

2104
01:11:01,759 --> 01:11:02,904
Me?

2105
01:11:03,329 --> 01:11:04,559
It's you, right?

2106
01:11:04,560 --> 01:11:06,069
- What? - Seeing how many you got taken.

2107
01:11:06,070 --> 01:11:08,798
- No, it's not me. - We won't fail,

2108
01:11:08,799 --> 01:11:10,975
- so it's you. - It's not.

2109
01:11:11,299 --> 01:11:12,538
It has to be you.

2110
01:11:12,539 --> 01:11:13,909
(What's the conclusion of this uncomfortable partnership?)

2111
01:11:13,910 --> 01:11:14,939
- Here's the result. - Okay.

2112
01:11:14,940 --> 01:11:17,178
Am I right? He got so many pictures taken.

2113
01:11:17,179 --> 01:11:18,208
I didn't.

2114
01:11:18,209 --> 01:11:20,609
Your name tag or face has to be in the picture.

2115
01:11:20,610 --> 01:11:21,754
Both of you...

2116
01:11:22,150 --> 01:11:24,578
(What's the result?)

2117
01:11:24,579 --> 01:11:27,425
Both of you didn't get more than three.

2118
01:11:27,520 --> 01:11:28,888
- Really? - Really?

2119
01:11:28,889 --> 01:11:29,888
You both succeeded.

2120
01:11:29,889 --> 01:11:31,958
See? It's not me.

2121
01:11:31,959 --> 01:11:35,404
I turned slightly and avoided them.

2122
01:11:35,660 --> 01:11:36,828
It's you.

2123
01:11:36,829 --> 01:11:37,828
(Did they succeed because one of them is the bio-terrorist?)

2124
01:11:37,829 --> 01:11:40,069
- I swear it's not me. - It is you.

2125
01:11:40,070 --> 01:11:41,229
I swear it's not.

2126
01:11:41,230 --> 01:11:43,044
- Are you sure? - Yes.

2127
01:11:43,870 --> 01:11:46,185
- You're questioning me a lot. - I swear it's not me.

2128
01:11:46,839 --> 01:11:48,414
I never try this hard.

2129
01:11:48,610 --> 01:11:50,678
- It's not you? - I don't think it's Jong Kook.

2130
01:11:50,679 --> 01:11:52,038
- It's not Kwang Soo either. - I think it's either...

2131
01:11:52,039 --> 01:11:53,824
Jong Kook or Kwang Soo.

2132
01:11:53,850 --> 01:11:55,055
I think it's Haha.

2133
01:11:55,480 --> 01:11:57,494
It's either Dong Hoon or Jae Seok.

2134
01:11:57,980 --> 01:11:59,519
It's either one of you.

2135
01:11:59,520 --> 01:12:01,464
Why aren't you questioning each other?

2136
01:12:01,719 --> 01:12:03,864
(Sliding in)

2137
01:12:04,560 --> 01:12:05,664
Hey.

2138
01:12:06,060 --> 01:12:07,935
(She punishes him.)

2139
01:12:08,459 --> 01:12:09,899
(She hits him reflexively.)

2140
01:12:09,900 --> 01:12:11,529
Hold on.

2141
01:12:11,530 --> 01:12:13,399
Don't do that to him.

2142
01:12:13,400 --> 01:12:15,975
(She's also stunned.)

2143
01:12:16,070 --> 01:12:18,275
He's 54.

2144
01:12:18,339 --> 01:12:20,909
- Don't do that. - He's 54.

2145
01:12:20,910 --> 01:12:22,109
- I heard the sound. - Punk!

2146
01:12:22,110 --> 01:12:24,038
- I'm sorry. - Nobody has slapped me like this...

2147
01:12:24,039 --> 01:12:25,178
- in a long time. - I'm sorry.

2148
01:12:25,179 --> 01:12:26,485
- Hey. - Ji Hyo.

2149
01:12:27,249 --> 01:12:28,409
I'm sorry.

2150
01:12:28,410 --> 01:12:30,154
- He's eating the snack. - The snack.

2151
01:12:30,179 --> 01:12:32,949
- Why are you eating that? - Why are you replenishing glucose?

2152
01:12:32,950 --> 01:12:34,624
- I thought you had no appetite. - I'm really sorry.

2153
01:12:34,690 --> 01:12:35,994
I'm really sorry.

2154
01:12:36,089 --> 01:12:37,494
- They're back. - They're back.

2155
01:12:37,660 --> 01:12:39,029
They took a while.

2156
01:12:39,030 --> 01:12:40,659
- They're back. - They took a long time.

2157
01:12:40,660 --> 01:12:41,958
Their faces are clean.

2158
01:12:41,959 --> 01:12:43,199
Both of them?

2159
01:12:43,200 --> 01:12:44,758
Haha, what's that?

2160
01:12:44,759 --> 01:12:46,345
- What's up with Haha? - Neither of them?

2161
01:12:46,400 --> 01:12:47,599
It's not the mission.

2162
01:12:47,600 --> 01:12:49,374
(This is the right timing.)

2163
01:12:50,200 --> 01:12:51,645
(Ripping)

2164
01:12:51,669 --> 01:12:53,015
- What? - All right.

2165
01:12:53,310 --> 01:12:55,239
(The old zombie attacks.)

2166
01:12:55,240 --> 01:12:57,214
(Here's one more infected member.)

2167
01:12:57,240 --> 01:12:58,378
What?

2168
01:12:58,379 --> 01:12:59,378
(He's dazed.)

2169
01:12:59,379 --> 01:13:00,378
Did he just rip it off?

2170
01:13:00,379 --> 01:13:02,794
Why do people keep dying in a disappointing way?

2171
01:13:02,919 --> 01:13:05,178
It's time for you to come to our side, everybody.

2172
01:13:05,179 --> 01:13:06,248
What's wrong?

2173
01:13:06,249 --> 01:13:08,588
Anyhow, on this route,

2174
01:13:08,589 --> 01:13:10,559
- both members succeeded. - What is it?

2175
01:13:10,560 --> 01:13:12,359
(Haha and Jae Seok aren't infected.)

2176
01:13:12,360 --> 01:13:15,088
(The bio-terrorist is among them.)

2177
01:13:15,089 --> 01:13:16,659
Is the bio-terrorist doing their job?

2178
01:13:16,660 --> 01:13:18,529
What do they do?

2179
01:13:18,530 --> 01:13:20,544
- Not getting caught. - Is that their job?

2180
01:13:20,900 --> 01:13:22,475
I guess then...

2181
01:13:22,639 --> 01:13:24,439
you're looking for the bio-terrorist.

2182
01:13:24,440 --> 01:13:25,569
We have to.

2183
01:13:25,570 --> 01:13:26,939
We haven't found the bio-terrorist yet.

2184
01:13:26,940 --> 01:13:28,668
Jae Seok,

2185
01:13:28,669 --> 01:13:31,739
did you think you succeeded with the mission?

2186
01:13:31,740 --> 01:13:34,279
I thought he failed for sure.

2187
01:13:34,280 --> 01:13:35,779
He got many pictures taken of his backside.

2188
01:13:35,780 --> 01:13:38,624
Haha is starting to corner Jae Seok, right?

2189
01:13:39,820 --> 01:13:41,949
(Is he cornering Jae Seok?)

2190
01:13:41,950 --> 01:13:43,819
That's what he does. He corners people.

2191
01:13:43,820 --> 01:13:45,034
This is driving me nuts.

2192
01:13:45,060 --> 01:13:47,229
- Because you two went. - So I...

2193
01:13:47,230 --> 01:13:50,059
- asked at the convenience store. - Sure. Listen to me.

2194
01:13:50,060 --> 01:13:52,404
(You be quiet.)

2195
01:13:52,700 --> 01:13:54,645
Two of you went out together this time.

2196
01:13:54,700 --> 01:13:56,838
I think you got caught.

2197
01:13:56,839 --> 01:13:59,468
It's not me. It's him.

2198
01:13:59,469 --> 01:14:01,809
Haha, it was the two of us.

2199
01:14:01,810 --> 01:14:04,578
If Kwang Soo or I laughed, we were eliminated.

2200
01:14:04,579 --> 01:14:06,178
You can see it.

2201
01:14:06,179 --> 01:14:08,309
Who can confirm it?

2202
01:14:08,310 --> 01:14:09,824
(He creeps up slowly.)

2203
01:14:09,919 --> 01:14:12,949
(He goes behind Jong Kook.)

2204
01:14:12,950 --> 01:14:16,065
(He tries to rip off Jong Kook's name tag.)

2205
01:14:18,759 --> 01:14:20,504
(Ouch!)

2206
01:14:21,060 --> 01:14:23,374
(Jong Kook punishes him immediately.)

2207
01:14:23,759 --> 01:14:25,945
(It's fun for everybody watching.)

2208
01:14:26,129 --> 01:14:28,645
That looks so painful.

2209
01:14:28,799 --> 01:14:31,275
That looks really painful.

2210
01:14:31,339 --> 01:14:32,914
(Goodness)

2211
01:14:33,539 --> 01:14:34,569
(He almost choked to death.)

2212
01:14:34,570 --> 01:14:36,914
I heard a thud when you bumped heads.

2213
01:14:38,079 --> 01:14:40,025
Jong Kook is incredible.

2214
01:14:40,749 --> 01:14:43,154
He had his chance.

2215
01:14:43,620 --> 01:14:45,025
This much of his hand was in my mouth.

2216
01:14:46,450 --> 01:14:48,195
Why didn't we get a hint?

2217
01:14:48,289 --> 01:14:49,788
I'll give you the last hint.

2218
01:14:49,789 --> 01:14:52,628
This is the hint Jong Kook and Kwang Soo earned.

2219
01:14:52,629 --> 01:14:54,258
There are two routes left,

2220
01:14:54,259 --> 01:14:56,059
- but I'll erase one. - Good.

2221
01:14:56,060 --> 01:14:57,258
(He erases one route.)

2222
01:14:57,259 --> 01:15:00,498
(The race is over once they use one route and finish the tasks.)

2223
01:15:00,499 --> 01:15:02,029
What do we need to do then?

2224
01:15:02,030 --> 01:15:05,138
Play a simple indoor game, then eat refreshments. That's all.

2225
01:15:05,139 --> 01:15:06,614
An indoor game.

2226
01:15:06,709 --> 01:15:09,239
Jong Kook, you can pick one person...

2227
01:15:09,240 --> 01:15:10,784
to do the mission.

2228
01:15:11,310 --> 01:15:13,748
Who should I send? Give me your opinions.

2229
01:15:13,749 --> 01:15:16,319
- Ji Hyo hasn't gone yet. - I haven't gone.

2230
01:15:16,320 --> 01:15:18,548
- She hasn't gone? - We can test her.

2231
01:15:18,549 --> 01:15:19,849
Sure. Go, Ji Hyo.

2232
01:15:19,850 --> 01:15:21,288
I'll go then.

2233
01:15:21,289 --> 01:15:22,819
But I swear I'm not the bio-terrorist.

2234
01:15:22,820 --> 01:15:24,718
Either way, if you succeed, we'll be suspicious.

2235
01:15:24,719 --> 01:15:26,788
- Ji Hyo, make sure you succeed. - If you fail...

2236
01:15:26,789 --> 01:15:28,489
If you succeed, we'll know the way.

2237
01:15:28,490 --> 01:15:30,305
- I know. We have to know. - How to kill the bio-terrorist.

2238
01:15:31,230 --> 01:15:32,769
See you later.

2239
01:15:32,770 --> 01:15:33,828
Let's go.

2240
01:15:33,829 --> 01:15:34,968
I pick four.

2241
01:15:34,969 --> 01:15:36,574
Check the phone.

2242
01:15:36,999 --> 01:15:38,769
"Before you reach your destination,"

2243
01:15:38,770 --> 01:15:42,239
"you have to face four bullies in the neighborhood."

2244
01:15:42,240 --> 01:15:43,714
"You succeed if you win three times."

2245
01:15:44,209 --> 01:15:46,378
- You have 30 minutes. - Okay.

2246
01:15:46,379 --> 01:15:47,925
Can I do something else?

2247
01:15:47,980 --> 01:15:50,355
Can I hit or curse at them?

2248
01:15:51,719 --> 01:15:53,664
How do the zombies win?

2249
01:15:53,850 --> 01:15:55,418
Once everybody is infected.

2250
01:15:55,419 --> 01:15:57,258
That's so difficult.

2251
01:15:57,259 --> 01:16:00,088
At this rate, humans will win.

2252
01:16:00,089 --> 01:16:02,364
- That's true. - Humans will win.

2253
01:16:02,700 --> 01:16:04,374
Is that right?

2254
01:16:04,530 --> 01:16:06,899
- Ji Hyo went... - If there's one human left.

2255
01:16:06,900 --> 01:16:09,044
- Did you see how shocked he was? - What's wrong, Jae Seok?

2256
01:16:10,100 --> 01:16:12,175
(Did you see how shocked he was?)

2257
01:16:12,370 --> 01:16:13,815
Hold on.

2258
01:16:15,839 --> 01:16:18,038
He was surprised to hear the humans might win.

2259
01:16:18,039 --> 01:16:20,985
- I'm a true entertainer. - Really?

2260
01:16:21,249 --> 01:16:22,479
(Is he making an excuse?)

2261
01:16:22,480 --> 01:16:24,479
I forgot what my role was...

2262
01:16:24,480 --> 01:16:25,989
- and reacted. - That's right.

2263
01:16:25,990 --> 01:16:27,364
I'm a professional.

2264
01:16:27,490 --> 01:16:29,065
What's the penalty today?

2265
01:16:29,860 --> 01:16:32,359
We have to think about Ji Hyo too.

2266
01:16:32,360 --> 01:16:34,288
- She's... - Acting skills.

2267
01:16:34,289 --> 01:16:35,428
I'm not sure about her.

2268
01:16:35,429 --> 01:16:37,798
- She could be acting. - But we know nothing.

2269
01:16:37,799 --> 01:16:41,199
(What is Ji Hyo's identity?)

2270
01:16:41,200 --> 01:16:43,044
This is driving me nuts.

2271
01:16:44,240 --> 01:16:46,609
I'm going to practice Tetris.

2272
01:16:46,610 --> 01:16:47,638
(She has the mark under her eyes.)

2273
01:16:47,639 --> 01:16:48,638
(She lost twice and got infected.)

2274
01:16:48,639 --> 01:16:51,084
I'm going to practice Omok.

2275
01:16:52,480 --> 01:16:54,508
Virus, virus.

2276
01:16:54,509 --> 01:16:56,849
(She's not the bio-terrorist.)

2277
01:16:56,850 --> 01:16:59,765
(There are three suspects left.)

2278
01:17:00,820 --> 01:17:03,119
Ji Hyo's infected.

2279
01:17:03,120 --> 01:17:05,334
- Is she out? - She's a zombie.

2280
01:17:05,520 --> 01:17:06,928
She failed.

2281
01:17:06,929 --> 01:17:08,034
Ji Hyo.

2282
01:17:08,289 --> 01:17:09,904
You're a zombie?

2283
01:17:10,060 --> 01:17:11,235
Jae Seok.

2284
01:17:11,360 --> 01:17:13,099
Was it hard?

2285
01:17:13,100 --> 01:17:15,968
Anyhow, you finished everything on the schedule.

2286
01:17:15,969 --> 01:17:17,899
You went through all the routes,

2287
01:17:17,900 --> 01:17:20,239
so I'll tell you how to eliminate the bio-terrorist.

2288
01:17:20,240 --> 01:17:23,439
(He reveals how to eliminate the bio-terrorist.)

2289
01:17:23,440 --> 01:17:24,555
What is it?

2290
01:17:24,709 --> 01:17:26,454
- What? - It's a water gun.

2291
01:17:26,549 --> 01:17:30,779
When you shoot water on the bio-terrorist's face,

2292
01:17:30,780 --> 01:17:32,849
he's eliminated.

2293
01:17:32,850 --> 01:17:35,048
(If you shoot water on his face, he's eliminated.)

2294
01:17:35,049 --> 01:17:37,458
However, if you accidentally shoot water on a human,

2295
01:17:37,459 --> 01:17:39,859
the person behind the water gun and the target are both out.

2296
01:17:39,860 --> 01:17:40,964
Who's going to use the water gun?

2297
01:17:41,030 --> 01:17:42,498
Jong Kook will.

2298
01:17:42,499 --> 01:17:43,828
Jong Kook is human.

2299
01:17:43,829 --> 01:17:45,404
(He will shoot.)

2300
01:17:45,429 --> 01:17:47,029
Why are you giving it to me?

2301
01:17:47,030 --> 01:17:48,404
Does he have a responsibility?

2302
01:17:48,730 --> 01:17:49,798
- Why? - Why?

2303
01:17:49,799 --> 01:17:51,899
- Jong Kook is human. - I see.

2304
01:17:51,900 --> 01:17:53,414
It's one of them.

2305
01:17:53,969 --> 01:17:56,055
- Finally. - I think...

2306
01:17:56,610 --> 01:17:59,284
Jae Seok's reaction earlier...

2307
01:17:59,310 --> 01:18:01,208
- It was unbelievable. - I understand your concern.

2308
01:18:01,209 --> 01:18:02,355
Right?

2309
01:18:02,450 --> 01:18:05,548
(Jong Kook's deduction: Jae Seok was shocked...)

2310
01:18:05,549 --> 01:18:09,189
(when he heard humans might win. Is he the bio-terrorist?)

2311
01:18:09,190 --> 01:18:12,294
(Why did he get so startled?)

2312
01:18:13,389 --> 01:18:15,088
I was just reacting.

2313
01:18:15,089 --> 01:18:16,559
- That's possible. - You said...

2314
01:18:16,560 --> 01:18:18,628
you're a professional entertainer.

2315
01:18:18,629 --> 01:18:19,668
- Right. - That's your point.

2316
01:18:19,669 --> 01:18:22,428
Listen to me. I just got goosebumps.

2317
01:18:22,429 --> 01:18:25,199
I thought I failed when Haha mentioned that.

2318
01:18:25,200 --> 01:18:26,909
But I didn't fail.

2319
01:18:26,910 --> 01:18:28,269
- So... - It's one of you.

2320
01:18:28,270 --> 01:18:30,515
that's where I got the idea.

2321
01:18:30,579 --> 01:18:32,239
To tell you the truth,

2322
01:18:32,240 --> 01:18:34,178
I picked him as my partner for a reason.

2323
01:18:34,179 --> 01:18:35,548
- Why? - I wanted to check him.

2324
01:18:35,549 --> 01:18:36,748
- Did you call him? - Yes.

2325
01:18:36,749 --> 01:18:38,154
(He wanted to check Haha.)

2326
01:18:38,650 --> 01:18:41,048
But I don't know.

2327
01:18:41,049 --> 01:18:43,095
What should I do? Will they be standing?

2328
01:18:43,160 --> 01:18:46,229
They'll be standing, so pick one person and shoot water on them.

2329
01:18:46,230 --> 01:18:48,888
- I've never been this calm. - He's calm.

2330
01:18:48,889 --> 01:18:49,958
Here I go.

2331
01:18:49,959 --> 01:18:53,998
(Who will he pick?)

2332
01:18:53,999 --> 01:18:56,275
- Just in case though. - What?

2333
01:18:56,740 --> 01:18:58,769
(What?)

2334
01:18:58,770 --> 01:19:00,784
Do you want to see me lose it?

2335
01:19:01,410 --> 01:19:03,479
(What is going on here?)

2336
01:19:03,480 --> 01:19:04,578
He's getting started.

2337
01:19:04,579 --> 01:19:06,154
I'm not saying it's you.

2338
01:19:06,310 --> 01:19:07,654
Just in case.

2339
01:19:07,850 --> 01:19:09,048
Jong Kook...

2340
01:19:09,049 --> 01:19:12,578
(He became a person of interest with an inappropriate reaction.)

2341
01:19:12,579 --> 01:19:15,864
(He became a person of interest with the "vinegar" comment.)

2342
01:19:16,259 --> 01:19:18,859
(Who did he pick?)

2343
01:19:18,860 --> 01:19:20,689
(Jae Seok)

2344
01:19:20,690 --> 01:19:21,765
Good job.

2345
01:19:21,990 --> 01:19:24,475
(Did he end up picking Jae Seok?)

2346
01:19:25,200 --> 01:19:26,504
This is annoying.

2347
01:19:27,370 --> 01:19:29,638
- The bio-terrorist is... - Let's see.

2348
01:19:29,639 --> 01:19:31,414
Let's see. Hold on.

2349
01:19:31,700 --> 01:19:32,708
No.

2350
01:19:32,709 --> 01:19:34,769
- The bio-terrorist is... - No.

2351
01:19:34,770 --> 01:19:37,784
(If he was wrong, the bio-terrorist wins.)

2352
01:19:37,810 --> 01:19:40,909
(Who's the bio-terrorist?)

2353
01:19:40,910 --> 01:19:42,178
Jae Seok.

2354
01:19:42,179 --> 01:19:44,349
(Jae Seok)

2355
01:19:44,350 --> 01:19:46,319
- I'm relieved. - I'm so relieved.

2356
01:19:46,320 --> 01:19:47,548
- Were you confused? - Yes.

2357
01:19:47,549 --> 01:19:49,218
At the end.

2358
01:19:49,219 --> 01:19:51,458
- Was it really you? - My fellow bio-terrorists.

2359
01:19:51,459 --> 01:19:52,595
(I'm sorry, fellow bio-terrorists.)

2360
01:19:52,629 --> 01:19:55,758
Today's race is A House Without an Exit.

2361
01:19:55,759 --> 01:19:59,074
You're a bio-terrorist who resets...

2362
01:19:59,329 --> 01:20:01,675
people's emotions and appetite.

2363
01:20:01,829 --> 01:20:03,275
What was that?

2364
01:20:03,469 --> 01:20:08,208
(When So Min tried the password on Haha,)

2365
01:20:08,209 --> 01:20:11,838
(he saw that Haha replied "vinegar" without having a clue.)

2366
01:20:11,839 --> 01:20:15,954
(He decided to corner Haha.)

2367
01:20:16,980 --> 01:20:19,319
(He approached the infected members.)

2368
01:20:19,320 --> 01:20:20,794
(It's you.)

2369
01:20:21,350 --> 01:20:22,964
(My babies)

2370
01:20:23,190 --> 01:20:25,095
(Welcome, leader.)

2371
01:20:25,620 --> 01:20:27,534
(Eliminate the humans.)

2372
01:20:28,389 --> 01:20:30,798
(He almost won.)

2373
01:20:30,799 --> 01:20:33,029
We found out too late.

2374
01:20:33,030 --> 01:20:34,529
Anyhow, you two survived as humans.

2375
01:20:34,530 --> 01:20:36,869
- Oh, my. - It's been a while.

2376
01:20:36,870 --> 01:20:38,374
You didn't have to give us this.

2377
01:20:38,440 --> 01:20:39,985
We can't share.

2378
01:20:40,009 --> 01:20:41,769
You didn't have to.

2379
01:20:41,770 --> 01:20:43,078
- Oh, dear. - Goodness.

2380
01:20:43,079 --> 01:20:44,309
I didn't know.

2381
01:20:44,310 --> 01:20:45,378
Look at this.

2382
01:20:45,379 --> 01:20:47,479
If Jae Seok won,

2383
01:20:47,480 --> 01:20:50,479
he would have picked two infected members for the penalty.

2384
01:20:50,480 --> 01:20:51,979
Since this happened,

2385
01:20:51,980 --> 01:20:53,949
Jong Kook and Haha will pick...

2386
01:20:53,950 --> 01:20:56,059
two people to be exempt. Everybody else will get the penalty.

2387
01:20:56,060 --> 01:20:57,059
Except for two?

2388
01:20:57,060 --> 01:20:58,765
(Everybody but 2 chosen by Haha and Jong Kook will get the penalty.)

2389
01:20:59,160 --> 01:21:01,029
- Except for those 2? - Except for 2.

2390
01:21:01,030 --> 01:21:03,159
- But Jae Seok will get the penalty. - Right.

2391
01:21:03,160 --> 01:21:04,428
(Jae Seok will suffer the penalty.)

2392
01:21:04,429 --> 01:21:07,345
(What kind of penalty awaits the 4 unlucky members?)

2393
01:21:07,870 --> 01:21:08,869
(Let's go.)

2394
01:21:08,870 --> 01:21:10,569
(A secret organization of fierce members, R)

2395
01:21:10,570 --> 01:21:12,069
(I'll show you how a professional rolls.)

2396
01:21:12,070 --> 01:21:13,145
(Stop filming.)

2397
01:21:13,669 --> 01:21:15,945
(Go Min Si and Hwang Bo Ran have joined R too.)

2398
01:21:16,379 --> 01:21:18,414
(The organization's goal is the gold bars.)

2399
01:21:18,810 --> 01:21:20,279
(At the end of the secret mission,)

2400
01:21:20,280 --> 01:21:22,994
(they successfully acquired the gold bars.)

2401
01:21:23,379 --> 01:21:26,395
(They do a mysterious celebratory performance.)

2402
01:21:26,749 --> 01:21:28,489
(However,)

2403
01:21:28,490 --> 01:21:30,958
(a thief has betrayed the organization.)

2404
01:21:30,959 --> 01:21:32,788
(The room of truth is open.)

2405
01:21:32,789 --> 01:21:34,128
(You betrayed us, didn't you?)

2406
01:21:34,129 --> 01:21:36,034
(It's not me.)

2407
01:21:36,129 --> 01:21:37,859
(Is it you, then?)

2408
01:21:37,860 --> 01:21:40,145
(It's not me, either.)

2409
01:21:40,799 --> 01:21:43,145
(As they laugh and chat, the gold bars keep disappearing.)

2410
01:21:43,740 --> 01:21:46,744
(And the shocking identity of the thief is revealed.)

2411
01:21:47,169 --> 01:21:48,645
(Betray for the Gold Bars)
