1
00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:09,965
(Autumn is the perfect season to film along with fall foliage.)

2
00:00:10,460 --> 00:00:12,398
- Hello. - Hi.

3
00:00:12,399 --> 00:00:13,759
- Hello. - Hi.

4
00:00:13,760 --> 00:00:15,159
(Se Chan and So Min arrived earlier than usual.)

5
00:00:15,160 --> 00:00:16,698
That was natural, right?

6
00:00:16,699 --> 00:00:18,169
(But they spotted something.)

7
00:00:18,170 --> 00:00:19,899
- What's that? - I have no idea.

8
00:00:19,900 --> 00:00:21,169
- What is that? - What is it?

9
00:00:21,170 --> 00:00:23,138
I don't know. Look at this.

10
00:00:23,139 --> 00:00:25,169
- Who's going to wear this? - Is that centaur?

11
00:00:25,170 --> 00:00:27,178
I don't know. What is this?

12
00:00:27,179 --> 00:00:29,379
- This is the worst. - Who is this for?

13
00:00:29,380 --> 00:00:30,484
(These four colorful outfits wait for their owners.)

14
00:00:30,810 --> 00:00:32,478
(2 weeks ago, they arrested the bio-terrorist, Jae Seok.)

15
00:00:32,479 --> 00:00:35,688
(Except for Haha and Jong Kook, everyone will face the penalty.)

16
00:00:35,689 --> 00:00:39,689
(However, Haha and Jong Kook can save two people from the penalty.)

17
00:00:39,690 --> 00:00:42,129
(The first survivor is Kwang Soo.)

18
00:00:42,130 --> 00:00:44,665
(The second survivor is Seok Jin.)

19
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:49,275
(The rest of them will face the penalty during the opening.)

20
00:00:50,069 --> 00:00:51,745
This is the worst.

21
00:00:51,969 --> 00:00:53,038
Which one is yours?

22
00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:55,169
So Min will wear a Minion's outfit.

23
00:00:55,170 --> 00:00:57,108
- Minions? - That's cute.

24
00:00:57,109 --> 00:00:58,269
- They gave you a cute one. - It's cute.

25
00:00:58,270 --> 00:00:59,278
Is that for me?

26
00:00:59,279 --> 00:01:01,184
- Is that yours? - Is that for me?

27
00:01:01,310 --> 00:01:03,724
You're the octopus villain from "Little Mermaid".

28
00:01:04,550 --> 00:01:05,578
Ursula.

29
00:01:05,579 --> 00:01:06,678
I don't know who she is.

30
00:01:06,679 --> 00:01:09,265
I'm just curious. When he wears that,

31
00:01:09,390 --> 00:01:12,489
does he just wear this without anything on the bottom?

32
00:01:12,490 --> 00:01:13,659
(Does he just wear this without anything on the bottom?)

33
00:01:13,660 --> 00:01:15,435
Hey, you want me to wear this with just my underpants on?

34
00:01:15,490 --> 00:01:17,728
What is that? No way. That's ridiculous.

35
00:01:17,729 --> 00:01:19,675
That's a nice outfit. I think it will be funny.

36
00:01:19,699 --> 00:01:20,698
Let's change.

37
00:01:20,699 --> 00:01:23,605
Once you change into your outfit, we'll start your makeup.

38
00:01:24,169 --> 00:01:26,444
I think we're meeting so often these days.

39
00:01:26,970 --> 00:01:30,639
I went to the amusement park a while ago.

40
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:31,939
(What?)

41
00:01:31,940 --> 00:01:33,409
(My gosh, Se Chan.)

42
00:01:33,410 --> 00:01:34,739
My gosh, Se Chan.

43
00:01:34,740 --> 00:01:36,054
I don't know. This is...

44
00:01:36,780 --> 00:01:39,478
(It's obvious that 8 tentacles were made at the last minute.)

45
00:01:39,479 --> 00:01:41,849
- Hey. - You didn't put any effort into it.

46
00:01:41,850 --> 00:01:43,788
It's really tight on the bottom.

47
00:01:43,789 --> 00:01:45,389
Strangely, it resembles Se Chan.

48
00:01:45,390 --> 00:01:46,565
It does?

49
00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:49,065
I can't wait to see it.

50
00:01:49,330 --> 00:01:51,364
(What? That's...)

51
00:01:51,390 --> 00:01:53,058
You're going to use glue?

52
00:01:53,059 --> 00:01:54,474
(You're going to use glue on my eyebrows?)

53
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:56,969
- What? Glue on your face? - I've done a lot of makeup,

54
00:01:56,970 --> 00:01:58,398
but using glue is the first.

55
00:01:58,399 --> 00:01:59,474
(The glue is new to this veteran.)

56
00:01:59,569 --> 00:02:02,568
So Min, you get the penalty every single time.

57
00:02:02,569 --> 00:02:05,244
I don't know. I guess I'm fated to face the penalty.

58
00:02:05,410 --> 00:02:09,224
Promise me. When I get married, delete all of these clips.

59
00:02:09,509 --> 00:02:11,855
No, they should play the clips at your wedding.

60
00:02:11,979 --> 00:02:14,124
You know that they play a video at weddings, right?

61
00:02:14,150 --> 00:02:16,295
The video before the weddings.

62
00:02:16,650 --> 00:02:17,864
They have to play this.

63
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:20,094
What's that?

64
00:02:20,660 --> 00:02:22,488
What did they put on your face? Are those bruises?

65
00:02:22,489 --> 00:02:23,934
(What did they put on your face? Did you get bruises?)

66
00:02:24,930 --> 00:02:27,175
I look like a patient. A sick patient.

67
00:02:27,859 --> 00:02:29,904
- He's sick of it. - You're an expert, right?

68
00:02:30,100 --> 00:02:31,575
I'm sorry to have doubted you.

69
00:02:31,630 --> 00:02:34,475
We just got started. But people always doubt in the beginning.

70
00:02:35,269 --> 00:02:37,309
- Hi, Ji Hyo. - You're here.

71
00:02:37,310 --> 00:02:39,478
- Ji Hyo. - Which year were you born?

72
00:02:39,479 --> 00:02:40,638
Year of Rooster.

73
00:02:40,639 --> 00:02:42,785
- You're a chicken then. - You're a chicken.

74
00:02:42,910 --> 00:02:45,084
(Ji Hyo will be the Angry Bird.)

75
00:02:45,380 --> 00:02:48,494
You can wear it every day. You're always angry.

76
00:02:49,019 --> 00:02:50,288
- Hello. - My gosh.

77
00:02:50,289 --> 00:02:51,649
- My gosh. - Jae Seok.

78
00:02:51,650 --> 00:02:54,318
Jae Seok, you can come later. There's nothing for you to do.

79
00:02:54,319 --> 00:02:57,228
I was surprised for a second. I thought you had makeup on.

80
00:02:57,229 --> 00:02:58,788
Jae Seok, did you get your makeup done for the penalty?

81
00:02:58,789 --> 00:03:02,205
So Min, check if he got the special makeup done.

82
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:04,168
- Jae Seok. - Jae Seok, you need...

83
00:03:04,169 --> 00:03:06,198
- to dress up for your penalty. - What is it?

84
00:03:06,199 --> 00:03:07,814
You'll be a llama.

85
00:03:08,870 --> 00:03:11,209
You're a llama, so you'll be called Yuma today.

86
00:03:11,210 --> 00:03:14,209
Since he'll look like a llama, people might feed him straws.

87
00:03:14,210 --> 00:03:16,084
Make sure you eat that. Okay?

88
00:03:16,579 --> 00:03:19,024
(The highest budget spent on a costume)

89
00:03:19,220 --> 00:03:21,624
- Shall I put on the wig? - Se Chan, you look so cool.

90
00:03:21,850 --> 00:03:23,195
You look great.

91
00:03:23,220 --> 00:03:25,888
- Don't I look like a musical actor? - Yes.

92
00:03:25,889 --> 00:03:30,758
You guys look like a couple from a theater troupe.

93
00:03:30,759 --> 00:03:32,599
(You guys look like a couple from a theater troupe.)

94
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:34,599
Honey. Thank you.

95
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:36,068
- She's starting the skit again. - Honey.

96
00:03:36,069 --> 00:03:38,105
Honey, are you an octopus today?

97
00:03:38,669 --> 00:03:40,268
(He can't get into the role.)

98
00:03:40,269 --> 00:03:42,244
- What's that? - My hair.

99
00:03:42,470 --> 00:03:44,244
- What? You had hair? - Yes.

100
00:03:44,870 --> 00:03:47,279
Look at them. They're having fun together.

101
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:48,578
(They're having fun together .)

102
00:03:48,579 --> 00:03:50,149
(A forced love interest for the airtime)

103
00:03:50,150 --> 00:03:52,078
My goodness. You look like a couple.

104
00:03:52,079 --> 00:03:53,494
Honey. Get on.

105
00:03:54,419 --> 00:03:55,695
Honey. Get on.

106
00:03:56,019 --> 00:03:57,888
Give back my body.

107
00:03:57,889 --> 00:04:00,695
Do you think we're doing a show today?

108
00:04:01,160 --> 00:04:02,959
This is a penalty.

109
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:05,488
So Min. It looks like you're happy with your character today.

110
00:04:05,489 --> 00:04:07,735
- Me? Do the Yondu makeup. - Yes.

111
00:04:08,699 --> 00:04:10,099
Everything after that is nice.

112
00:04:10,100 --> 00:04:11,244
(Afterward, she's happy with anything.)

113
00:04:13,639 --> 00:04:15,945
But isn't that wig for the grass?

114
00:04:16,139 --> 00:04:19,255
(His witch disguise is going nowhere.)

115
00:04:19,710 --> 00:04:21,054
Se Chan looks nice.

116
00:04:21,310 --> 00:04:23,454
I do resemble my mother.

117
00:04:23,850 --> 00:04:26,095
- Hey. - I just realized it. I'm serious.

118
00:04:26,749 --> 00:04:28,454
(What did your mother do to you to deserve that?)

119
00:04:28,479 --> 00:04:30,025
My gosh. Jae Seok.

120
00:04:30,220 --> 00:04:32,395
- I look like Hong Hyun Hee. Look. - You do look like her.

121
00:04:32,789 --> 00:04:34,759
(He also resembles Hong Hyun Hee?)

122
00:04:34,760 --> 00:04:36,688
- My goodness. - So Min, look at me.

123
00:04:36,689 --> 00:04:38,235
"Sir."

124
00:04:38,559 --> 00:04:40,959
Se Chan, Jae Seok looks like...

125
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:43,329
the kangaroo at the zoo.

126
00:04:43,330 --> 00:04:45,469
(The kangaroo who seemed to be troubled in Episode 470)

127
00:04:45,470 --> 00:04:47,545
Look at him. He looks just like the kangaroo.

128
00:04:47,640 --> 00:04:49,909
Look. Jae Seok.

129
00:04:49,910 --> 00:04:51,514
(Laughing)

130
00:04:51,570 --> 00:04:53,139
- Look at him. - My goodness.

131
00:04:53,140 --> 00:04:54,639
You can't laugh while doing my makeup.

132
00:04:54,640 --> 00:04:55,949
He looks like that kangaroo.

133
00:04:55,950 --> 00:04:57,925
You can't laugh while doing my makeup.

134
00:04:58,309 --> 00:04:59,849
- I mean... - Seriously.

135
00:04:59,850 --> 00:05:03,025
You look like that kangaroo. You resemble a lot of things.

136
00:05:03,049 --> 00:05:04,824
- You're done. - Okay.

137
00:05:05,220 --> 00:05:08,058
- Thank you. - Well done.

138
00:05:08,059 --> 00:05:09,159
(How will the llama look?)

139
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:10,665
(Bursting into laughter)

140
00:05:11,359 --> 00:05:13,599
Everyone, give him a standing ovation.

141
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:15,704
You look perfect.

142
00:05:15,970 --> 00:05:17,829
(Yuma is born.)

143
00:05:17,830 --> 00:05:20,199
Actually, he looked more like a llama without the makeup.

144
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:21,545
(You can't deny the resemblance.)

145
00:05:22,410 --> 00:05:23,769
The llama is eating.

146
00:05:23,770 --> 00:05:24,769
(The llama is eating.)

147
00:05:24,770 --> 00:05:26,678
(As llamas eat everything, they eat grass, straws, and chocolate chips.)

148
00:05:26,679 --> 00:05:29,525
- I need to shake it for llamas. - The llama is eating.

149
00:05:29,650 --> 00:05:32,454
They like it when I shake it like this. All right.

150
00:05:32,749 --> 00:05:34,178
Go ahead.

151
00:05:34,179 --> 00:05:36,649
(You brats.)

152
00:05:36,650 --> 00:05:38,864
Llama, there you go.

153
00:05:39,119 --> 00:05:41,288
But So Min's makeup could've been better.

154
00:05:41,289 --> 00:05:45,659
Jae Seok, we have to give her a yellow card. This can't be right.

155
00:05:45,660 --> 00:05:48,599
But the hair...

156
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:50,605
I mean, if she's going to be on the show,

157
00:05:51,669 --> 00:05:52,899
- Gosh. - it should be shocking like yours.

158
00:05:52,900 --> 00:05:54,569
You're making a lot of noise while you eat.

159
00:05:54,570 --> 00:05:55,744
(That's bothering me.)

160
00:05:56,410 --> 00:06:00,415
My goodness, Mr. Llama. You're eating too loud. Gosh.

161
00:06:00,679 --> 00:06:02,454
You're chewing it over and over again.

162
00:06:02,580 --> 00:06:03,978
Give us the mission.

163
00:06:03,979 --> 00:06:05,748
(It's time to listen to their mission.)

164
00:06:05,749 --> 00:06:08,579
- Today... - Don't you dare.

165
00:06:08,580 --> 00:06:10,488
(She's caught, trying to get on the llama's back.)

166
00:06:10,489 --> 00:06:12,688
Don't even think about it. Okay?

167
00:06:12,689 --> 00:06:15,319
Before you start your race,

168
00:06:15,320 --> 00:06:17,988
you will carry out a simple mission.

169
00:06:17,989 --> 00:06:20,959
You must run away from the other members...

170
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:23,998
in this park for 30 minutes starting now.

171
00:06:23,999 --> 00:06:24,998
(They must be on the run for 30 minutes.)

172
00:06:24,999 --> 00:06:28,769
(Stay away from the members for 30 minutes.)

173
00:06:28,770 --> 00:06:31,345
How could I get away from them in this costume?

174
00:06:31,640 --> 00:06:33,308
How can I run in this?

175
00:06:33,309 --> 00:06:35,849
This is good for you. You'll be running on fours.

176
00:06:35,850 --> 00:06:39,678
- You'll be much faster. It's good. - Hey, you have eight tentacles.

177
00:06:39,679 --> 00:06:41,319
(Here's an 8-wheeler!)

178
00:06:41,320 --> 00:06:42,988
- You have eight tentacles. - Right.

179
00:06:42,989 --> 00:06:45,389
- And you can fly around. - I can fly around.

180
00:06:45,390 --> 00:06:47,389
If you look at your costume,

181
00:06:47,390 --> 00:06:50,659
there are six spots such as the front, back, arms, and legs...

182
00:06:50,660 --> 00:06:55,498
- to put your name tags on. - Right.

183
00:06:55,499 --> 00:06:58,998
Among these 6 spots, you can choose 1 spot...

184
00:06:58,999 --> 00:07:02,839
to secretly hide a sticker for a chance card.

185
00:07:02,840 --> 00:07:04,384
- A chance card? - Okay.

186
00:07:04,570 --> 00:07:06,678
There is a total of six members...

187
00:07:06,679 --> 00:07:09,149
including two guests who will chase after you.

188
00:07:09,150 --> 00:07:13,079
The chasers can only take off two name tags per each member.

189
00:07:13,080 --> 00:07:15,949
If they get a name tag where you hid your chance card,

190
00:07:15,950 --> 00:07:18,188
the chaser will take the chance card.

191
00:07:18,189 --> 00:07:21,219
If you manage to protect the card until your time is up,

192
00:07:21,220 --> 00:07:23,558
you will get the chance card.

193
00:07:23,559 --> 00:07:24,764
That's nice.

194
00:07:25,429 --> 00:07:29,798
You will attach your own chance card in secret.

195
00:07:29,799 --> 00:07:30,829
Okay.

196
00:07:30,830 --> 00:07:31,905
(Where will they put it?)

197
00:07:32,169 --> 00:07:33,969
- The weather is great today. - Yes.

198
00:07:33,970 --> 00:07:35,738
As you can see, there are only four of you.

199
00:07:35,739 --> 00:07:38,409
Before we meet the rest of the members,

200
00:07:38,410 --> 00:07:40,478
let me bring in two guests who will join you today.

201
00:07:40,479 --> 00:07:41,779
- The guests are coming here? - They are coming here.

202
00:07:41,780 --> 00:07:43,079
Guests, come on out.

203
00:07:43,080 --> 00:07:45,254
All right. Come on out.

204
00:07:45,379 --> 00:07:46,595
- Over there. - They are coming.

205
00:07:47,679 --> 00:07:49,688
(Are they two ladies...)

206
00:07:49,689 --> 00:07:52,095
(with a spring in their steps?)

207
00:07:52,890 --> 00:07:54,288
Hey, Hyun Hee.

208
00:07:54,289 --> 00:07:56,488
(Hong Hyun Hee, the comedienne and Park Ji Hyun, the actress)

209
00:07:56,489 --> 00:07:57,628
Hyun Hee.

210
00:07:57,629 --> 00:07:58,965
Hello.

211
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:02,259
(The marriage ambassador, Hong Hyun Hee)

212
00:08:02,260 --> 00:08:05,345
(This comedienne is ruling the industry with her husband.)

213
00:08:05,770 --> 00:08:09,744
(She has a wide range of roles with her delicate performances.)

214
00:08:10,640 --> 00:08:13,378
(She was in a historical drama as well as a horror movie.)

215
00:08:13,379 --> 00:08:17,355
(This rising actress made the movie look realistic with her acting.)

216
00:08:17,780 --> 00:08:19,494
Hello.

217
00:08:20,479 --> 00:08:21,925
(Feeling super excited)

218
00:08:22,789 --> 00:08:24,425
- Hello. - Hi.

219
00:08:24,489 --> 00:08:26,535
- Hello. - Hello.

220
00:08:26,660 --> 00:08:29,089
By the way, where is Jae Seok?

221
00:08:29,090 --> 00:08:31,428
- He has something to do. - Why did you ask that right away?

222
00:08:31,429 --> 00:08:33,858
- Why did you ask that right away? - He'll be here.

223
00:08:33,859 --> 00:08:35,428
Well, he's the symbol of this show.

224
00:08:35,429 --> 00:08:36,668
- "Symbol"? - Yes.

225
00:08:36,669 --> 00:08:38,398
- That's true, but today... - That's so outdated.

226
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:40,669
You're trying to get into his clique in an outdated manner.

227
00:08:40,670 --> 00:08:42,738
(Trying to get into Jae Seok's clique)

228
00:08:42,739 --> 00:08:44,039
We don't do that anymore.

229
00:08:44,040 --> 00:08:45,138
- I mean... - We don't do that.

230
00:08:45,139 --> 00:08:47,408
I don't know who's leading. I don't know who I should look at.

231
00:08:47,409 --> 00:08:48,839
You can look at anyone.

232
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:51,079
- We work for the viewers. - You can look at the camera.

233
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:53,778
By the way, you married such a nice guy.

234
00:08:53,779 --> 00:08:56,189
- Thank you. - I like your show.

235
00:08:56,190 --> 00:08:57,449
They make a great couple.

236
00:08:57,450 --> 00:08:58,689
- They make a great couple. - And they are so fun to watch.

237
00:08:58,690 --> 00:09:00,289
- Besides, he's younger than her. - By four years.

238
00:09:00,290 --> 00:09:03,329
After getting married, I've been working...

239
00:09:03,330 --> 00:09:05,765
10 years' worth of work in just 1 year.

240
00:09:06,129 --> 00:09:07,998
- I actually got to save up. - Congratulations.

241
00:09:07,999 --> 00:09:09,268
I bet you made a lot of money.

242
00:09:09,269 --> 00:09:11,169
Our first wedding anniversary is this October.

243
00:09:11,170 --> 00:09:12,398
- Give me a round of applause. - Really?

244
00:09:12,399 --> 00:09:13,868
(Our first wedding anniversary is this October.)

245
00:09:13,869 --> 00:09:15,039
(Give me a round of applause.)

246
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:17,084
She told us to give her a round of applause.

247
00:09:17,170 --> 00:09:19,539
- I heard that when I was in Turbo. - Right.

248
00:09:19,540 --> 00:09:20,978
- Right. - Now that Jae Seok isn't here...

249
00:09:20,979 --> 00:09:22,878
The hosts would say, "Give a round of applause."

250
00:09:22,879 --> 00:09:24,025
(Jae Seok is missed in many ways.)

251
00:09:24,550 --> 00:09:25,824
Here's what's interesting.

252
00:09:25,879 --> 00:09:28,395
Ji Hyun didn't get to say a word at all.

253
00:09:28,649 --> 00:09:31,025
Actually, we don't have a lot of information.

254
00:09:31,420 --> 00:09:32,834
Please introduce yourself.

255
00:09:32,989 --> 00:09:36,128
Hello, I'm a new actress. My name is Park Ji Hyun.

256
00:09:36,129 --> 00:09:38,104
(I'm a new actress. My name is Park Ji Hyun.)

257
00:09:38,629 --> 00:09:42,175
Why is she joining us today?

258
00:09:42,899 --> 00:09:44,398
What? What do you mean why?

259
00:09:44,399 --> 00:09:46,275
- What do you mean why? - No, hear me out.

260
00:09:46,369 --> 00:09:47,898
- Then, why are you here? - Hear me out.

261
00:09:47,899 --> 00:09:49,768
Why are you joining us today?

262
00:09:49,769 --> 00:09:51,709
I was wondering if she was here to promote something.

263
00:09:51,710 --> 00:09:54,115
- Like a drama. - You should've asked smoothly.

264
00:09:54,139 --> 00:09:56,679
Today's theme is the popular comedienne and popular actress.

265
00:09:56,680 --> 00:09:58,179
- I see. You're popular. - That's the theme.

266
00:09:58,180 --> 00:10:00,525
- You're popular. - Not at all.

267
00:10:00,950 --> 00:10:03,148
Before we start the race,

268
00:10:03,149 --> 00:10:05,449
you'll do a preliminary mission for the chance card.

269
00:10:05,450 --> 00:10:06,518
- A chance card? - We'll just do it?

270
00:10:06,519 --> 00:10:07,518
(There's a chance card?)

271
00:10:07,519 --> 00:10:09,829
You decided on the members to face the penalty two weeks ago.

272
00:10:09,830 --> 00:10:11,929
Those four members have put on a costume and makeup...

273
00:10:11,930 --> 00:10:13,599
and are on the run in the park.

274
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:14,875
- Gosh. - On the run?

275
00:10:16,100 --> 00:10:17,368
My fur is shedding. This is awful.

276
00:10:17,369 --> 00:10:18,875
- Right? It's shedding a lot. - My goodness.

277
00:10:18,899 --> 00:10:20,669
Starting now, you will...

278
00:10:20,670 --> 00:10:21,939
It's going to be hard to hide too.

279
00:10:21,940 --> 00:10:23,169
- Start... - You can't hide.

280
00:10:23,170 --> 00:10:25,669
- the race. - My gosh. It's too early for this.

281
00:10:25,670 --> 00:10:27,385
- You'll start the mission now. - Great.

282
00:10:27,509 --> 00:10:28,709
Where are they?

283
00:10:28,710 --> 00:10:30,508
Start the race.

284
00:10:30,509 --> 00:10:32,724
- Let's split. - Let's split.

285
00:10:32,820 --> 00:10:34,819
Jong Kook, we only have 30 minutes.

286
00:10:34,820 --> 00:10:37,064
My goodness, hold on. How can I find them?

287
00:10:38,350 --> 00:10:39,795
I hate running the most.

288
00:10:40,889 --> 00:10:42,135
What kind of costume did they put on?

289
00:10:43,330 --> 00:10:44,388
(So Min the Minion is on the run with her hair fluttering.)

290
00:10:44,389 --> 00:10:45,834
My shoes are too heavy.

291
00:10:46,759 --> 00:10:48,135
I picked the wrong shoes.

292
00:10:48,359 --> 00:10:50,728
(I'm going to get angry!)

293
00:10:50,729 --> 00:10:51,875
Move.

294
00:10:52,940 --> 00:10:54,275
I hear something from there.

295
00:10:56,269 --> 00:10:57,339
(Barking)

296
00:10:57,340 --> 00:10:58,545
No, I'm a human.

297
00:10:58,909 --> 00:11:00,908
I'm a human.

298
00:11:00,909 --> 00:11:02,214
My dog doesn't bark at people.

299
00:11:02,950 --> 00:11:04,155
Wait.

300
00:11:04,409 --> 00:11:06,054
The dog doesn't bark at people.

301
00:11:06,279 --> 00:11:07,395
I'm a human.

302
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:10,464
I can't run in this costume.

303
00:11:10,950 --> 00:11:12,819
(The 4-wheeler is broken.)

304
00:11:12,820 --> 00:11:15,234
(He hides in the woods.)

305
00:11:16,930 --> 00:11:19,005
(Looking docile)

306
00:11:19,029 --> 00:11:20,505
My gosh, this is too white.

307
00:11:22,100 --> 00:11:23,398
If I roam around, I'll get caught no matter what.

308
00:11:23,399 --> 00:11:25,474
(His costume is quite visible. What will happen to the llama?)

309
00:11:25,769 --> 00:11:28,015
(Meanwhile, Hyun Hee who hates running...)

310
00:11:28,499 --> 00:11:30,385
Where are they?

311
00:11:31,340 --> 00:11:32,854
I don't think I need to...

312
00:11:33,609 --> 00:11:35,554
run from the beginning.

313
00:11:35,940 --> 00:11:37,525
(Hello.)

314
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:40,925
(My gosh, it's Hyun Hee!)

315
00:11:42,180 --> 00:11:43,724
(Feeling hyper)

316
00:11:43,889 --> 00:11:46,858
(It sounds like a conversation among animals.)

317
00:11:46,859 --> 00:11:48,219
Do you have gimbap?

318
00:11:48,220 --> 00:11:49,758
(That was her agenda.)

319
00:11:49,759 --> 00:11:51,189
(We have gimbap!)

320
00:11:51,190 --> 00:11:52,564
Gimbap.

321
00:11:53,029 --> 00:11:56,474
(Depending on the presence of gimbap, her reactions vary.)

322
00:11:56,930 --> 00:11:58,429
(What? I see a lot of people.)

323
00:11:58,430 --> 00:11:59,645
Who is it?

324
00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:01,045
Who's there?

325
00:12:01,540 --> 00:12:02,814
That's Hyun Hee. Darn it.

326
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:04,844
What's she doing?

327
00:12:05,310 --> 00:12:07,354
She doesn't want to get the chance chard.

328
00:12:07,379 --> 00:12:08,785
Do you have gimbap?

329
00:12:10,050 --> 00:12:13,594
(Meanwhile, Ji Hyo the Angry Bird is running in the woods.)

330
00:12:17,119 --> 00:12:18,689
(Jong Kook finds her red costume.)

331
00:12:18,690 --> 00:12:19,795
Hey, she's right there.

332
00:12:20,389 --> 00:12:22,658
(Jong Kook fiercely chases after her.)

333
00:12:22,659 --> 00:12:24,728
(And Ji Hyo toddles away while getting mad.)

334
00:12:24,729 --> 00:12:25,988
She's right there.

335
00:12:25,989 --> 00:12:27,135
She's a parrot.

336
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:33,444
(Jong Kook is coming from the left, and Haha from the right)

337
00:12:33,670 --> 00:12:34,768
Just come here.

338
00:12:34,769 --> 00:12:36,385
(What should I do?)

339
00:12:36,470 --> 00:12:38,444
- Come here. - I'm so angry!

340
00:12:39,940 --> 00:12:41,115
I got it.

341
00:12:42,239 --> 00:12:44,478
- Are you the Angry Bird? - She's the Angry Bird.

342
00:12:44,479 --> 00:12:45,925
I'm so angry.

343
00:12:46,450 --> 00:12:48,454
- Right here. - Haha got one.

344
00:12:49,279 --> 00:12:50,289
Really?

345
00:12:50,290 --> 00:12:52,518
(He finds the chance card on his first try.)

346
00:12:52,519 --> 00:12:55,018
- Okay. I got the chance card. - Really?

347
00:12:55,019 --> 00:12:57,604
(Ji Hyo is out, and Haha gets a chance card.)

348
00:12:59,290 --> 00:13:00,358
Chance card!

349
00:13:00,359 --> 00:13:04,074
(Haha is on a roll. His next target is So Min the Minion.)

350
00:13:04,369 --> 00:13:06,415
- Come on. - Okay.

351
00:13:06,899 --> 00:13:08,275
Are you serious?

352
00:13:08,670 --> 00:13:09,839
Come on.

353
00:13:09,840 --> 00:13:11,385
(He also steals So Min's chance card.)

354
00:13:12,040 --> 00:13:13,214
I got the chance card.

355
00:13:14,609 --> 00:13:15,814
Se Chan!

356
00:13:15,909 --> 00:13:17,309
Se Chan!

357
00:13:17,310 --> 00:13:19,008
(Se Chan is spotted by Hyun Hee who was looking for gimbap.)

358
00:13:19,009 --> 00:13:20,518
I don't know the rules.

359
00:13:20,519 --> 00:13:22,378
(She gets a chance card.)

360
00:13:22,379 --> 00:13:23,388
Teach me.

361
00:13:23,389 --> 00:13:25,995
(As Se Chan is out, only the llama remains.)

362
00:13:26,149 --> 00:13:27,618
I can't find Jae Seok.

363
00:13:27,619 --> 00:13:29,765
(Everyone is getting eliminated, but Jae Seok is seen nowhere.)

364
00:13:29,989 --> 00:13:31,234
Where is he?

365
00:13:31,430 --> 00:13:35,005
(Kwang Soo is passing by the llama's hideout.)

366
00:13:35,659 --> 00:13:36,844
Where is he hiding?

367
00:13:37,629 --> 00:13:38,844
It's Kwang Soo.

368
00:13:39,399 --> 00:13:40,775
Se Chan.

369
00:13:40,940 --> 00:13:42,099
Se Chan.

370
00:13:42,100 --> 00:13:43,745
(It turns to be the best spot to hide.)

371
00:13:44,940 --> 00:13:48,008
(It's the perfect blind spot. Haha zealously looks for Jae Seok.)

372
00:13:48,009 --> 00:13:49,314
(It's the perfect blind spot.)

373
00:13:50,580 --> 00:13:51,724
Seriously.

374
00:13:51,810 --> 00:13:53,454
I'm a professional.

375
00:13:53,519 --> 00:13:54,854
My gosh, look at this.

376
00:13:55,350 --> 00:13:57,289
Wandering around will not help at all.

377
00:13:57,290 --> 00:13:58,564
(Wandering around doesn't help in the jungle.)

378
00:13:58,590 --> 00:14:01,035
(Only 1 minute remains.)

379
00:14:02,389 --> 00:14:03,604
(Surprised)

380
00:14:04,759 --> 00:14:08,228
(Kwang Soo found something all of a sudden.)

381
00:14:08,229 --> 00:14:10,304
(He goes after the llama's tail.)

382
00:14:11,930 --> 00:14:13,868
(Dashing away)

383
00:14:13,869 --> 00:14:16,469
(The giraffe spotted the llama's movement.)

384
00:14:16,470 --> 00:14:19,108
(And everyone gathers around.)

385
00:14:19,109 --> 00:14:20,755
- Over there. - He's over there.

386
00:14:21,779 --> 00:14:22,878
It's Jae Seok.

387
00:14:22,879 --> 00:14:24,408
(The 4-wheeler is too slow.)

388
00:14:24,409 --> 00:14:25,525
I got you.

389
00:14:26,050 --> 00:14:28,694
(The llama is caught right before time is up.)

390
00:14:28,779 --> 00:14:30,518
- I was so surprised. - He got me first.

391
00:14:30,519 --> 00:14:31,589
I was really surprised.

392
00:14:31,590 --> 00:14:32,888
- are you a llama? - Yes.

393
00:14:32,889 --> 00:14:34,189
- Seriously. - You're a llama?

394
00:14:34,190 --> 00:14:36,988
- I thought he was a real llama. - He looks like a real llama.

395
00:14:36,989 --> 00:14:38,929
I was doing a pretty good job at hiding.

396
00:14:38,930 --> 00:14:40,258
- He looks like a real llama. - I was so surprised.

397
00:14:40,259 --> 00:14:41,875
- This is amazing. - I get to take off two, right?

398
00:14:42,100 --> 00:14:43,199
I'll do it.

399
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:45,405
(I'll take the one from here.)

400
00:14:46,129 --> 00:14:47,375
Here I go.

401
00:14:48,170 --> 00:14:50,615
(There's no chance card.)

402
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:52,669
- I got scared for a second. - You got one more chance.

403
00:14:52,670 --> 00:14:53,738
You were scared for a second?

404
00:14:53,739 --> 00:14:54,915
(What?)

405
00:14:55,239 --> 00:14:57,849
(If he got scared when I chose his left leg,)

406
00:14:57,850 --> 00:15:01,594
(does that mean the chance card is on his right leg?)

407
00:15:02,479 --> 00:15:03,694
No, it's not here.

408
00:15:05,420 --> 00:15:07,089
It's not here. It cannot be here.

409
00:15:07,090 --> 00:15:09,665
(10 seconds before time is up)

410
00:15:09,790 --> 00:15:11,028
It has to be here!

411
00:15:11,029 --> 00:15:12,658
(Will Kwang Soo take it? Or can Jae Seok keep it safe?)

412
00:15:12,659 --> 00:15:15,905
(What will happen to the chance card?)

413
00:15:18,430 --> 00:15:20,498
(Sighing)

414
00:15:20,499 --> 00:15:21,699
The race is over.

415
00:15:21,700 --> 00:15:22,839
(No one was able to steal Jae Seok's chance card.)

416
00:15:22,840 --> 00:15:24,309
My goodness.

417
00:15:24,310 --> 00:15:25,809
You can't find the chance card?

418
00:15:25,810 --> 00:15:26,908
(Where is Jae Seok's chance card?)

419
00:15:26,909 --> 00:15:29,515
Jae Seok, there's a spot on the stomach.

420
00:15:29,649 --> 00:15:30,849
- Where? - There's a spot on the belly.

421
00:15:30,850 --> 00:15:32,625
- I should put it on the belly. - There's a spot on the belly.

422
00:15:33,050 --> 00:15:34,278
Lucky you.

423
00:15:34,279 --> 00:15:35,579
Jae Seok is so lucky.

424
00:15:35,580 --> 00:15:38,219
(He hides the chance card where it can't be easily reached.)

425
00:15:38,220 --> 00:15:40,334
- Where is it? - It's on my belly.

426
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:42,234
- It's on my belly. - Goodness.

427
00:15:43,190 --> 00:15:45,535
We have guests today.

428
00:15:46,229 --> 00:15:48,228
Hyun Hee and Ji Hyun are joining today.

429
00:15:48,229 --> 00:15:49,559
- Hello. - Hi.

430
00:15:49,560 --> 00:15:52,069
You weren't here earlier. I looked for you as soon as I got here.

431
00:15:52,070 --> 00:15:53,675
- I wasn't here? - Right.

432
00:15:54,040 --> 00:15:55,069
(Feeling excited again)

433
00:15:55,070 --> 00:15:56,214
She's hyper.

434
00:15:56,340 --> 00:15:58,638
Weren't you in "Gonjiam", Ji Hyun?

435
00:15:58,639 --> 00:16:00,179
- Yes, that's right. - I knew it.

436
00:16:00,180 --> 00:16:01,679
- Right. - "Gonjiam".

437
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:04,008
Right. Why didn't you tell us that?

438
00:16:04,009 --> 00:16:06,008
- That was the scariest movie. - Earlier...

439
00:16:06,009 --> 00:16:08,618
- The movie was really scary. - Thank you.

440
00:16:08,619 --> 00:16:11,449
How do you feel being on our show for the first time? I'm curious.

441
00:16:11,450 --> 00:16:13,834
It's my first variety show ever.

442
00:16:14,359 --> 00:16:16,434
- I'm so nervous. - This is your first variety show?

443
00:16:16,830 --> 00:16:19,589
I was on "One Night Two Days" briefly. It was really brief.

444
00:16:19,590 --> 00:16:21,175
- You were on that show? - "One Night Two Days"?

445
00:16:21,930 --> 00:16:24,429
(What are they picking up after asking her a question?)

446
00:16:24,430 --> 00:16:26,245
- Very briefly. - What are you doing?

447
00:16:26,330 --> 00:16:27,875
What are you doing?

448
00:16:28,300 --> 00:16:30,245
You asked her a question.

449
00:16:30,369 --> 00:16:32,039
- You asked her a question. - What are you doing?

450
00:16:32,040 --> 00:16:34,285
It kept fluttering away. My apologies, Ji Hyun.

451
00:16:34,310 --> 00:16:35,439
- It's all right. - You should shave.

452
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:36,748
- I'm sorry. - I thought it was a foxtail.

453
00:16:36,749 --> 00:16:38,655
- You should shave. - I'm sorry.

454
00:16:38,879 --> 00:16:40,618
- I thought it was a foxtail. - By the way,

455
00:16:40,619 --> 00:16:42,648
is Se Chan older than you, Hyun Hee?

456
00:16:42,649 --> 00:16:44,194
No, I debuted before her, but I'm younger than her.

457
00:16:44,950 --> 00:16:46,758
- You're like Jae Seok and Seok Jin. - You're just like us.

458
00:16:46,759 --> 00:16:48,758
- You're just like them. - You're similar to us.

459
00:16:48,759 --> 00:16:51,758
But she always treats me with respect like a senior comedian.

460
00:16:51,759 --> 00:16:53,574
- She's always respectful. - Yes, I am.

461
00:16:54,029 --> 00:16:55,535
- Seok Jin isn't like that. - You should learn from her.

462
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:56,998
- You should learn from her. - Why don't you do the same?

463
00:16:56,999 --> 00:16:58,275
What are you talking about?

464
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:00,738
You need to be respectful toward Jae Seok.

465
00:17:00,739 --> 00:17:02,275
- I have to do that to him? - Yes.

466
00:17:03,070 --> 00:17:04,339
I mean this when I say it.

467
00:17:04,340 --> 00:17:05,969
- I should teach him a lesson. - You should.

468
00:17:05,970 --> 00:17:07,714
(He sounds serious.)

469
00:17:08,180 --> 00:17:09,209
I plan to teach him...

470
00:17:09,210 --> 00:17:10,954
- and So Min a lesson. - Yes.

471
00:17:11,649 --> 00:17:12,779
- You should. - Seriously.

472
00:17:12,780 --> 00:17:13,918
- I need to be harsh on So Min. - You ought to do that.

473
00:17:13,919 --> 00:17:15,454
- You should. - I need to be harsh on her.

474
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:17,618
- Look at her disguise. - This isn't right.

475
00:17:17,619 --> 00:17:20,118
For a comedienne, this isn't acceptable.

476
00:17:20,119 --> 00:17:21,289
(For a comedienne, this isn't acceptable.)

477
00:17:21,290 --> 00:17:22,789
- Comedienne? - Comedienne?

478
00:17:22,790 --> 00:17:25,004
- It's not acceptable. - It's weak, isn't it?

479
00:17:25,560 --> 00:17:26,734
Today,

480
00:17:26,929 --> 00:17:29,599
to celebrate autumn which is full of delicacies,

481
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:31,368
you will visit good restaurants with the guests...

482
00:17:31,369 --> 00:17:34,315
and taste delicacies of the autumn ingredients.

483
00:17:35,300 --> 00:17:37,908
- You came on the right day. - You came on the right day.

484
00:17:37,909 --> 00:17:39,509
Usually, it's really hard to be on our show.

485
00:17:39,510 --> 00:17:41,355
- This is great. - You picked the right day to come.

486
00:17:44,649 --> 00:17:47,549
(A restaurant mission to celebrate autumn with full of delicacies)

487
00:17:47,550 --> 00:17:49,418
Of course, the number of members who can eat...

488
00:17:49,419 --> 00:17:50,718
and the mission will change for each restaurant.

489
00:17:50,719 --> 00:17:52,849
And only the winning members can eat the food.

490
00:17:52,850 --> 00:17:54,434
(Only the winning members can have the meal.)

491
00:17:54,659 --> 00:17:56,829
As for the chance cards you acquired earlier,

492
00:17:56,830 --> 00:17:59,229
if you don't have a chance to eat the meal,

493
00:17:59,230 --> 00:18:01,458
you will be given a chance to have one bite of your choice.

494
00:18:01,459 --> 00:18:03,305
- 1 bite? - 1 bite?

495
00:18:03,869 --> 00:18:05,675
Right now, Haha has...

496
00:18:05,869 --> 00:18:07,214
two chance cards.

497
00:18:07,240 --> 00:18:09,375
Hyun Hee stole one from Se Chan.

498
00:18:09,500 --> 00:18:11,168
And Jae Seok was able to keep his chance card.

499
00:18:11,169 --> 00:18:12,239
- Okay! - He did?

500
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:14,479
Later, Haha, you can give one of your cards to someone else.

501
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:16,549
Or you can use both of the cards.

502
00:18:16,550 --> 00:18:17,724
I'll use them.

503
00:18:17,780 --> 00:18:19,284
I don't know the definition of "give".

504
00:18:19,449 --> 00:18:20,694
Is that so?

505
00:18:21,149 --> 00:18:22,294
Same here.

506
00:18:22,750 --> 00:18:24,425
However, today's race is called...

507
00:18:24,490 --> 00:18:27,289
Let's Eat with Greedy Pigs.

508
00:18:27,290 --> 00:18:28,519
- "Let's Eat"? - There are greedy pigs.

509
00:18:28,520 --> 00:18:30,029
- There are greedy pigs. - Among you,

510
00:18:30,030 --> 00:18:31,289
there are two greedy pigs.

511
00:18:31,290 --> 00:18:33,089
- Two again? - My goodness. What is this?

512
00:18:33,090 --> 00:18:34,635
Today, it has to be Kwang Soo.

513
00:18:34,760 --> 00:18:36,628
- Why me? Why? - It has to be Kwang Soo.

514
00:18:36,629 --> 00:18:37,999
- It has to be you, Kwang Soo. - It must be you.

515
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,375
- Why are your ears red? - It's about time...

516
00:18:40,439 --> 00:18:41,799
- that he got a role. - But Kwang Soo...

517
00:18:41,800 --> 00:18:43,868
- looked different from yesterday. - Right. He smiled earlier.

518
00:18:43,869 --> 00:18:46,514
- Seok Jin wants us to pick on him. - I applied a bit here.

519
00:18:46,679 --> 00:18:48,678
(This doubt-seeker is praying with his hands clasped.)

520
00:18:48,679 --> 00:18:49,908
- It's not him. - It's not?

521
00:18:49,909 --> 00:18:51,055
Don't do it? Okay.

522
00:18:51,310 --> 00:18:53,024
(Don't give him attention.)

523
00:18:53,149 --> 00:18:55,625
I think it has to be Kwang Soo.

524
00:18:55,879 --> 00:18:57,565
- Shouldn't we pick on him once? - It's either Kwang Soo...

525
00:18:58,119 --> 00:18:59,365
Let me tell you why it can't be him.

526
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:00,858
He doesn't eat much to be a greedy pig.

527
00:19:00,859 --> 00:19:02,135
- That's true. - Right.

528
00:19:02,159 --> 00:19:04,305
- And he doesn't enjoy the food. - Right, he doesn't.

529
00:19:05,030 --> 00:19:06,128
All right.

530
00:19:06,129 --> 00:19:08,175
There's a hidden mission for the greedy pigs.

531
00:19:08,500 --> 00:19:11,299
- I'll reveal the hidden mission. - What?

532
00:19:11,300 --> 00:19:12,628
(You'll reveal the hidden mission?)

533
00:19:12,629 --> 00:19:14,269
- What's the mission? - The greedy pigs...

534
00:19:14,270 --> 00:19:17,214
must not eat any food today.

535
00:19:17,240 --> 00:19:19,284
- But you have a chance to eat. - They have to keep losing.

536
00:19:19,469 --> 00:19:21,438
- If they eat anything, - Should I make them have a bite?

537
00:19:21,439 --> 00:19:23,249
Those who get to eat...

538
00:19:23,250 --> 00:19:26,148
will know how many greedy pigs are in that group.

539
00:19:26,149 --> 00:19:27,519
(The staff will reveal the number of greedy pigs.)

540
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:29,349
They're giving us a lot of intel today.

541
00:19:29,350 --> 00:19:31,289
- I know. - The greedy pigs can't eat?

542
00:19:31,290 --> 00:19:32,549
- How is that possible? - They'll get caught right away.

543
00:19:32,550 --> 00:19:34,559
After trying three fall special dishes,

544
00:19:34,560 --> 00:19:35,958
you'll get to vote.

545
00:19:35,959 --> 00:19:39,158
If you fail to catch both greedy pigs, they'll win.

546
00:19:39,159 --> 00:19:41,974
They'll get to pick two members who'll be penalized.

547
00:19:42,100 --> 00:19:44,769
Today's penalty is that after the filming,

548
00:19:44,770 --> 00:19:46,999
you will hand wash cars.

549
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:48,099
- Goodness. - Oh, no.

550
00:19:48,100 --> 00:19:49,198
No way.

551
00:19:49,199 --> 00:19:51,968
All right, please change, and then, we'll begin.

552
00:19:51,969 --> 00:19:53,555
- Okay. - Let's go.

553
00:19:54,010 --> 00:19:56,014
- I'm ravenous. - Me too.

554
00:19:56,709 --> 00:20:00,549
Ji Hyun looks a bit tense today.

555
00:20:00,550 --> 00:20:01,678
Did you not sleep well last night?

556
00:20:01,679 --> 00:20:02,678
- It's her first variety show. - You didn't, right?

557
00:20:02,679 --> 00:20:04,618
You have trouble sleeping before shooting your first variety show.

558
00:20:04,619 --> 00:20:05,819
You couldn't sleep well last night either, right?

559
00:20:05,820 --> 00:20:06,858
(You look unwell.)

560
00:20:06,859 --> 00:20:08,135
I slept very well.

561
00:20:09,189 --> 00:20:10,989
(He's in his best condition.)

562
00:20:10,990 --> 00:20:12,029
It doesn't look like so.

563
00:20:12,030 --> 00:20:14,059
- Your skin looks bad. - He's been doing this for 25 years,

564
00:20:14,060 --> 00:20:15,898
but he still gets nervous.

565
00:20:15,899 --> 00:20:19,329
Ji Hyun, what is your impression of Seok Jin?

566
00:20:19,330 --> 00:20:20,339
Tell us.

567
00:20:20,340 --> 00:20:21,799
Don't I look better in real life?

568
00:20:21,800 --> 00:20:23,039
Don't I?

569
00:20:23,040 --> 00:20:25,138
(What is her impression of him?)

570
00:20:25,139 --> 00:20:28,214
You're not wearing any makeup, are you?

571
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:29,979
- No, I am. - He's wearing thick makeup.

572
00:20:29,980 --> 00:20:31,579
It took him three hours.

573
00:20:31,580 --> 00:20:33,349
- It's very thick. - It took him three hours.

574
00:20:33,350 --> 00:20:36,079
We waited for him to shoot the opening scene.

575
00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:38,289
- You don't look too well. - He's wearing makeup.

576
00:20:38,290 --> 00:20:41,565
- It was dark when I put makeup on. - He wears a lot of makeup.

577
00:20:41,659 --> 00:20:43,194
What do you think about his personality?

578
00:20:43,629 --> 00:20:45,989
I think you're smart.

579
00:20:45,990 --> 00:20:47,829
- Right. - That's not it.

580
00:20:47,830 --> 00:20:49,898
- He majored in economics. - Right.

581
00:20:49,899 --> 00:20:52,105
- No, it was business. - Oh, right.

582
00:20:52,500 --> 00:20:54,168
You didn't take the SAT, right?

583
00:20:54,169 --> 00:20:55,269
No.

584
00:20:55,270 --> 00:20:56,514
He took the state examination.

585
00:20:56,570 --> 00:20:58,408
- He took the state examination? - That's right.

586
00:20:58,409 --> 00:20:59,645
He went to primary school.

587
00:20:59,980 --> 00:21:01,539
I walked to Hanyang.

588
00:21:01,540 --> 00:21:02,615
(He plays along.)

589
00:21:02,679 --> 00:21:05,254
He failed the first time around because his rice paper got ripped.

590
00:21:07,350 --> 00:21:09,754
It was too drenched in ink.

591
00:21:09,919 --> 00:21:11,749
(He was nervous, and his handwriting was too thick.)

592
00:21:11,750 --> 00:21:14,059
- Gosh, Seok Jin. - He's an intangible cultural asset.

593
00:21:14,060 --> 00:21:15,464
I know.

594
00:21:16,219 --> 00:21:17,989
Ji Hyun, are you good at drinking?

595
00:21:17,990 --> 00:21:19,388
No, I'm not.

596
00:21:19,389 --> 00:21:20,599
- Really? - It must be tough.

597
00:21:20,600 --> 00:21:21,698
What do you do for fun?

598
00:21:21,699 --> 00:21:22,999
- I like gaming. - What?

599
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:24,198
What game?

600
00:21:24,199 --> 00:21:25,529
I play League of Legends and PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds.

601
00:21:25,530 --> 00:21:27,938
- Really? - She's a game mania.

602
00:21:27,939 --> 00:21:29,069
Legendary Battlegrounds?

603
00:21:29,070 --> 00:21:31,368
(Legendary Battlegrounds?)

604
00:21:31,369 --> 00:21:34,979
(He mixes the two names.)

605
00:21:34,980 --> 00:21:37,509
Is that a Chinese idiom?

606
00:21:37,510 --> 00:21:38,708
(Are the battlegrounds legendary?)

607
00:21:38,709 --> 00:21:40,349
- What was that? - He's serious.

608
00:21:40,350 --> 00:21:42,378
It's League of Legends.

609
00:21:42,379 --> 00:21:44,618
- And PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds. - Come on.

610
00:21:44,619 --> 00:21:45,888
What's wrong with him?

611
00:21:45,889 --> 00:21:48,019
- What did you think it was? - His face is red.

612
00:21:48,020 --> 00:21:49,434
- It's League of Legends. - League of Legends.

613
00:21:49,590 --> 00:21:51,335
- League of Legends. - League of Legends?

614
00:21:52,459 --> 00:21:54,105
What is Jason doing today?

615
00:21:54,629 --> 00:21:56,398
He has a radio show.

616
00:21:56,399 --> 00:21:57,499
We appeared on the show together,

617
00:21:57,500 --> 00:21:59,168
but he was given a permanent position.

618
00:21:59,169 --> 00:22:02,514
Before they got married,

619
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:05,539
they went on a trip abroad for a very long time.

620
00:22:05,540 --> 00:22:07,309
- How long? - We went to Spain.

621
00:22:07,310 --> 00:22:08,378
- Before they got married? - Yes.

622
00:22:08,379 --> 00:22:09,579
Why did you go for so long?

623
00:22:09,580 --> 00:22:12,408
We got married after six months of dating.

624
00:22:12,409 --> 00:22:15,019
- My schedule wasn't that busy, - Trips are a must.

625
00:22:15,020 --> 00:22:17,024
so we went to Spain for two weeks.

626
00:22:17,149 --> 00:22:20,089
But we rarely went outside.

627
00:22:20,090 --> 00:22:21,819
We were getting to know each other.

628
00:22:21,820 --> 00:22:25,165
(Was it a field trip?)

629
00:22:25,990 --> 00:22:27,599
- That's a lie, right? - Right?

630
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:28,829
- You're lying, right? - No.

631
00:22:28,830 --> 00:22:30,099
Right?

632
00:22:30,100 --> 00:22:31,729
- Lucky them. - Right?

633
00:22:31,730 --> 00:22:34,168
We didn't get to see the Baroque buildings.

634
00:22:34,169 --> 00:22:36,968
We were busy getting to know each other.

635
00:22:36,969 --> 00:22:38,839
- So... - She must have a lethal charm.

636
00:22:38,840 --> 00:22:40,138
- She does. - She does.

637
00:22:40,139 --> 00:22:41,938
- She's very charming. - Indeed.

638
00:22:41,939 --> 00:22:43,549
- She's fun. - She is.

639
00:22:43,550 --> 00:22:45,148
- I thought I'd be living alone, - Being fun is the best.

640
00:22:45,149 --> 00:22:47,918
but this happened. You never know when it comes to life.

641
00:22:47,919 --> 00:22:48,918
- Soulmates do exist. - Yes.

642
00:22:48,919 --> 00:22:51,388
When did you feel that...

643
00:22:51,389 --> 00:22:53,289
he was the one?

644
00:22:53,290 --> 00:22:54,934
- So Min. - It's my time!

645
00:22:54,959 --> 00:22:56,658
- I've been waiting. - Do you have a boyfriend?

646
00:22:56,659 --> 00:22:58,289
- No. - That's why she asked, right?

647
00:22:58,290 --> 00:22:59,729
- No, she's single. - Really?

648
00:22:59,730 --> 00:23:02,204
She does have a slight interest in Se Chan.

649
00:23:02,760 --> 00:23:04,099
- But it's not reciprocated. - Jae Seok, come on.

650
00:23:04,100 --> 00:23:05,405
- Seriously? - You're in big trouble.

651
00:23:05,929 --> 00:23:07,569
- Don't be ridiculous. - I think you do have feelings.

652
00:23:07,570 --> 00:23:09,198
- So... - Then I wouldn't be doing this.

653
00:23:09,199 --> 00:23:10,809
You may not have any feelings for him,

654
00:23:10,810 --> 00:23:12,885
but your parents like you guys.

655
00:23:13,270 --> 00:23:14,539
So you could just think,

656
00:23:14,540 --> 00:23:16,479
- "I wonder how it'd be." - Just imagining it?

657
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:19,208
I can only do that if he gives me a hint.

658
00:23:19,209 --> 00:23:21,895
- He doesn't show me anything. - Look at you.

659
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:24,819
- But... - But since he acts that way...

660
00:23:24,820 --> 00:23:26,349
He's more charming. I'll tell you why.

661
00:23:26,350 --> 00:23:27,819
(She finds that more charming.)

662
00:23:27,820 --> 00:23:29,418
- He makes you go crazy. - He's...

663
00:23:29,419 --> 00:23:31,658
- That's not it. - I get it.

664
00:23:31,659 --> 00:23:33,759
He doesn't step over the line. That's why he's more charming.

665
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:36,759
- He is charming. - He'll be a good, loyal husband.

666
00:23:36,760 --> 00:23:39,504
He'll never cross the line with other women.

667
00:23:39,629 --> 00:23:42,438
That's why Park Na Rae likes him. He knows when to refuse.

668
00:23:42,439 --> 00:23:44,208
He says no if it's a no.

669
00:23:44,209 --> 00:23:45,309
That's a must.

670
00:23:45,310 --> 00:23:48,115
- He doesn't play the field. - Why didn't you say no to me?

671
00:23:48,409 --> 00:23:49,739
What do you mean?

672
00:23:49,740 --> 00:23:53,009
Tell her right now that you're not interested.

673
00:23:53,010 --> 00:23:54,319
I'm not.

674
00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:56,519
Forget it. I'm not interested in him either.

675
00:23:56,520 --> 00:23:58,519
You can't say that. You never know.

676
00:23:58,520 --> 00:24:00,118
Next thing you know, you're married.

677
00:24:00,119 --> 00:24:01,718
Go Eun said no to me at first.

678
00:24:01,719 --> 00:24:04,158
Se Chan said he saw So Min get wasted a couple of times.

679
00:24:04,159 --> 00:24:05,905
(There's a reason why he said no.)

680
00:24:06,030 --> 00:24:07,799
That's not it.

681
00:24:07,800 --> 00:24:09,575
- He saw you. - You're so cute.

682
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:12,329
- You're so cute. - She said I'm cute.

683
00:24:12,330 --> 00:24:14,039
- So Min can be cute. - Right.

684
00:24:14,040 --> 00:24:16,839
- You're so cute. - She's full of charms.

685
00:24:16,840 --> 00:24:18,069
(They arrive at the first destination.)

686
00:24:18,070 --> 00:24:19,984
I'd love to have some octopus.

687
00:24:20,109 --> 00:24:21,514
Look at this.

688
00:24:21,580 --> 00:24:22,885
It's samhap.

689
00:24:23,080 --> 00:24:24,349
- Look at this. - It's samhap.

690
00:24:24,350 --> 00:24:26,009
- Goodness. - I'm craving this.

691
00:24:26,010 --> 00:24:27,618
- It's samhap. - There's pork.

692
00:24:27,619 --> 00:24:29,079
- It's octopus soup. - There's kimchi too.

693
00:24:29,080 --> 00:24:30,319
I'm really craving this.

694
00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:32,194
This is insane.

695
00:24:32,949 --> 00:24:34,964
- Sit down. - Okay.

696
00:24:35,419 --> 00:24:37,865
Why are you sitting next to me? I thought you didn't like me.

697
00:24:39,189 --> 00:24:41,534
(They argue once again.)

698
00:24:42,300 --> 00:24:44,368
- You can sit over there. - I thought you didn't like me.

699
00:24:44,369 --> 00:24:46,099
- Why are you sitting next to me? - Go over there or just sit.

700
00:24:46,100 --> 00:24:48,345
- I just sat wherever. - They'll grow on each other.

701
00:24:48,469 --> 00:24:50,868
- They're arguing. - Ji Hyo was like that once.

702
00:24:50,869 --> 00:24:51,984
You're right.

703
00:24:52,010 --> 00:24:53,184
Are you doing well?

704
00:24:53,709 --> 00:24:54,855
"Are you doing well?"

705
00:24:55,409 --> 00:24:57,254
- How are you doing? - He's doing fine.

706
00:24:57,580 --> 00:25:00,155
- Are you doing well? - I'm watching and cheering for you.

707
00:25:00,179 --> 00:25:02,218
This first fall delicacy...

708
00:25:02,219 --> 00:25:03,724
is a treasure from the sea...

709
00:25:03,820 --> 00:25:05,448
and is good for rejuvenation and your eyes.

710
00:25:05,449 --> 00:25:07,194
It's a parboiled octopus set.

711
00:25:07,990 --> 00:25:08,989
(Kicking)

712
00:25:08,990 --> 00:25:10,158
It's octopus.

713
00:25:10,159 --> 00:25:11,489
(What is that?)

714
00:25:11,490 --> 00:25:13,464
- He's in good condition. - He is.

715
00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:15,698
You're quite hyper today.

716
00:25:15,699 --> 00:25:17,329
- Right? - You're hyper today.

717
00:25:17,330 --> 00:25:18,628
That must be good.

718
00:25:18,629 --> 00:25:21,698
Before doing the mission, we will play a game of wits...

719
00:25:21,699 --> 00:25:23,438
to determine how many people can eat.

720
00:25:23,439 --> 00:25:24,668
- We need to do that. - Game of wits?

721
00:25:24,669 --> 00:25:25,708
We all need to eat.

722
00:25:25,709 --> 00:25:27,779
For example, if I say 2 and 2 people stand up,

723
00:25:27,780 --> 00:25:30,055
only two people will eat.

724
00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:31,408
Let's say it's four.

725
00:25:31,409 --> 00:25:33,678
If no one calls out 5 in 5 seconds,

726
00:25:33,679 --> 00:25:35,819
then only four people can eat.

727
00:25:35,820 --> 00:25:38,519
It's best to call out the highest number possible.

728
00:25:38,520 --> 00:25:40,125
All right, everyone.

729
00:25:40,260 --> 00:25:43,158
I'm going to call out one, so do remember that.

730
00:25:43,159 --> 00:25:45,029
- I'll call out 2. - I'll call out 3.

731
00:25:45,030 --> 00:25:46,559
- I'll call out four. - We need the highest number.

732
00:25:46,560 --> 00:25:47,999
- I already said what I'll call out. - Everyone.

733
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:50,099
- The greedy pigs are listening. - Okay.

734
00:25:50,100 --> 00:25:51,468
(The greedy pigs heard their plan.)

735
00:25:51,469 --> 00:25:53,569
- They don't want to eat. - They'll interrupt us.

736
00:25:53,570 --> 00:25:54,968
- Right. - They'll make us fail.

737
00:25:54,969 --> 00:25:56,138
- One. - They shouldn't eat.

738
00:25:56,139 --> 00:25:57,468
They'll definitely call out one.

739
00:25:57,469 --> 00:25:58,509
(Listen to me.)

740
00:25:58,510 --> 00:26:00,168
- Be careful. - Seok Jin.

741
00:26:00,169 --> 00:26:03,155
- What? - Why isn't anyone listening to him?

742
00:26:03,810 --> 00:26:06,309
- We keep ignoring him. - Come on.

743
00:26:06,310 --> 00:26:08,118
Ji Hyun, you even ignored him.

744
00:26:08,119 --> 00:26:09,378
It's okay.

745
00:26:09,379 --> 00:26:10,648
It's okay.

746
00:26:10,649 --> 00:26:12,388
I'm right next to him, but I keep ignoring him.

747
00:26:12,389 --> 00:26:14,388
I keep focusing on her.

748
00:26:14,389 --> 00:26:15,718
I heard you.

749
00:26:15,719 --> 00:26:17,489
- Here we go. - I'll keep that in mind.

750
00:26:17,490 --> 00:26:18,605
Ready.

751
00:26:19,090 --> 00:26:21,158
Set. Go.

752
00:26:21,159 --> 00:26:22,305
One.

753
00:26:22,429 --> 00:26:24,428
(Jae Seok calls out right away.)

754
00:26:24,429 --> 00:26:26,769
(Everyone is looking at each other.)

755
00:26:26,770 --> 00:26:27,968
- 2. - 2.

756
00:26:27,969 --> 00:26:29,115
You both said it.

757
00:26:29,570 --> 00:26:32,438
(Kwang Soo and Ji Hyun say 2 at the same time.)

758
00:26:32,439 --> 00:26:34,754
You both said two at the same it.

759
00:26:35,280 --> 00:26:36,509
- Who was it other than Kwang Soo? - Goodness.

760
00:26:36,510 --> 00:26:37,979
- Did Kwang Soo say it? - What's wrong with you?

761
00:26:37,980 --> 00:26:39,009
(Everyone's suspicious of him.)

762
00:26:39,010 --> 00:26:40,479
Ji Hyun also stood up.

763
00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:42,994
What's the matter with you?

764
00:26:43,550 --> 00:26:45,989
- You don't want two people to eat? - It's obvious.

765
00:26:45,990 --> 00:26:47,589
Did you not like it?

766
00:26:47,590 --> 00:26:50,218
She's a rookie. I knew she'd call out two.

767
00:26:50,219 --> 00:26:52,188
You could've yielded to her.

768
00:26:52,189 --> 00:26:53,958
- Why would I? - Why did you stand up?

769
00:26:53,959 --> 00:26:55,799
At least three people should eat.

770
00:26:55,800 --> 00:26:56,898
You should've yielded to her.

771
00:26:56,899 --> 00:26:58,668
Five people should eat.

772
00:26:58,669 --> 00:27:01,099
- You're a greedy pig. - He's right.

773
00:27:01,100 --> 00:27:02,514
Let me say one thing.

774
00:27:02,639 --> 00:27:04,309
Before we heard about the rules,

775
00:27:04,310 --> 00:27:06,915
Ji Hyun was spotted somewhere all alone.

776
00:27:07,340 --> 00:27:09,108
That's because she didn't want to find any chance cards.

777
00:27:09,109 --> 00:27:11,279
- That's not true. - What do you mean?

778
00:27:11,280 --> 00:27:12,708
(She had no interest in the chance cards.)

779
00:27:12,709 --> 00:27:14,849
(Is she a greedy pig?)

780
00:27:14,850 --> 00:27:16,549
What do you mean?

781
00:27:16,550 --> 00:27:18,519
Look at her.

782
00:27:18,520 --> 00:27:20,194
She's a rookie.

783
00:27:20,689 --> 00:27:23,019
- You... - Just go home, already.

784
00:27:23,020 --> 00:27:24,559
You're a tall pig.

785
00:27:24,560 --> 00:27:26,589
- You're a tall pig. - That's true.

786
00:27:26,590 --> 00:27:27,799
(But I'm not a greedy pig.)

787
00:27:27,800 --> 00:27:29,999
- Why would you suspect her? - Only two people can eat.

788
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:32,099
Let's do a practice round.

789
00:27:32,100 --> 00:27:34,269
Okay. I finally got how to do it.

790
00:27:34,270 --> 00:27:37,668
Or we can change the rules and just pick out a random number.

791
00:27:37,669 --> 00:27:39,339
- I'm going to call out 1. - I'll call out 2.

792
00:27:39,340 --> 00:27:40,438
- I'll call out three. - I'm serious.

793
00:27:40,439 --> 00:27:41,615
- I'll call out 2. - I'll call out 4.

794
00:27:41,639 --> 00:27:42,984
I told you guys in advance.

795
00:27:43,480 --> 00:27:44,655
Get ready.

796
00:27:45,050 --> 00:27:46,279
Set. Go.

797
00:27:46,280 --> 00:27:48,118
- 1. - 1.

798
00:27:48,119 --> 00:27:49,178
(They both said 1.)

799
00:27:49,179 --> 00:27:51,188
- My gosh. - This is for certain.

800
00:27:51,189 --> 00:27:52,519
I told everyone that I'd call out one.

801
00:27:52,520 --> 00:27:54,158
Hey, it's you, isn't it?

802
00:27:54,159 --> 00:27:55,888
- It's you, right? - Hold on.

803
00:27:55,889 --> 00:27:57,059
- It's you. - It's you.

804
00:27:57,060 --> 00:27:59,358
- I said one before. - I repeated myself, right?

805
00:27:59,359 --> 00:28:00,934
- My gosh. - I heard you.

806
00:28:01,129 --> 00:28:02,999
- I said one before. - You're a greedy pig.

807
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:04,405
I called out one before.

808
00:28:04,500 --> 00:28:06,729
(Actually,)

809
00:28:06,730 --> 00:28:08,868
(Jae Seok did call out 1.)

810
00:28:08,869 --> 00:28:10,345
I called out one before.

811
00:28:10,540 --> 00:28:11,608
That's why.

812
00:28:11,609 --> 00:28:13,468
- We're on the same team. - Why would you call out one again?

813
00:28:13,469 --> 00:28:14,739
Gosh, Jae Seok.

814
00:28:14,740 --> 00:28:16,279
- This is infuriating. - Jae Seok messed it up.

815
00:28:16,280 --> 00:28:19,085
- He said it out loud. - It's him.

816
00:28:19,280 --> 00:28:20,425
- Hold on. - Look.

817
00:28:20,679 --> 00:28:22,254
Kwang Soo looks too happy.

818
00:28:22,980 --> 00:28:24,118
- Hold on. Kwang Soo. - He's too happy.

819
00:28:24,119 --> 00:28:25,218
- Why are you smiling so much? - Kwang Soo.

820
00:28:25,219 --> 00:28:27,819
- Do you have good news? - You're grinning.

821
00:28:27,820 --> 00:28:29,418
(Me?)

822
00:28:29,419 --> 00:28:30,958
- Why are you grinning? - They're driving me insane.

823
00:28:30,959 --> 00:28:32,428
- Why are you grinning? - Come on.

824
00:28:32,429 --> 00:28:33,489
- You're... - He's hilarious.

825
00:28:33,490 --> 00:28:35,529
- Then should I be crying? - That's not what I mean.

826
00:28:35,530 --> 00:28:37,168
This isn't a good situation.

827
00:28:37,169 --> 00:28:38,668
Doesn't he look strange?

828
00:28:38,669 --> 00:28:39,898
You should feel bad.

829
00:28:39,899 --> 00:28:41,599
- You should feel bad. - My goodness.

830
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:43,069
You should be regretting.

831
00:28:43,070 --> 00:28:44,539
I'm not smiling because I'm happy.

832
00:28:44,540 --> 00:28:46,708
- You should be flustered. - The situation is just funny.

833
00:28:46,709 --> 00:28:48,009
It wasn't that funny.

834
00:28:48,010 --> 00:28:49,809
He kept doing this.

835
00:28:49,810 --> 00:28:51,309
- He keeps... - That's not right.

836
00:28:51,310 --> 00:28:52,779
snickering.

837
00:28:52,780 --> 00:28:54,479
- That's not right. - You should know better.

838
00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:55,625
I know.

839
00:28:55,719 --> 00:28:58,349
There are 2 1's and 2 2's.

840
00:28:58,350 --> 00:29:00,418
- Who will pick? - Should Ji Hyo pick?

841
00:29:00,419 --> 00:29:01,764
Ji Hyun can.

842
00:29:02,389 --> 00:29:04,958
(He makes a suggestion, but Jae Seok ignores him.)

843
00:29:04,959 --> 00:29:06,229
All right, then.

844
00:29:06,230 --> 00:29:08,128
Did no one hear what...

845
00:29:08,129 --> 00:29:09,704
- Seok Jin said? - I know, right?

846
00:29:10,869 --> 00:29:11,999
- I pretended... - Everyone ignored him.

847
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:13,468
- like I didn't say anything. - He said it loud and clear.

848
00:29:13,469 --> 00:29:15,044
His voice is like background music.

849
00:29:15,139 --> 00:29:16,274
Please pick the right one.

850
00:29:16,639 --> 00:29:17,809
Let's see what you've got.

851
00:29:17,810 --> 00:29:19,309
Go, Chuncheon's daughter.

852
00:29:19,310 --> 00:29:20,678
(Which one did she pick?)

853
00:29:20,679 --> 00:29:21,855
What is it?

854
00:29:22,109 --> 00:29:23,954
(They especially focus on Kwang Soo.)

855
00:29:24,310 --> 00:29:25,754
- What? - I bet it's one.

856
00:29:25,810 --> 00:29:26,954
(It's a 1)

857
00:29:26,980 --> 00:29:28,849
- Sit. - Just sit down.

858
00:29:28,850 --> 00:29:29,979
(I'm sorry.)

859
00:29:29,980 --> 00:29:32,349
Actually, it won't be her.

860
00:29:32,350 --> 00:29:34,358
(He's an expert at taking it back.)

861
00:29:34,359 --> 00:29:36,289
- Hold on. - Didn't you hear what I said?

862
00:29:36,290 --> 00:29:38,734
I mentioned that Seok Jin suggested Ji Hyo first.

863
00:29:38,790 --> 00:29:39,958
Ji Hyo, go ahead.

864
00:29:39,959 --> 00:29:41,299
Be confidence.

865
00:29:41,300 --> 00:29:42,375
"Confidence"?

866
00:29:42,399 --> 00:29:44,168
Isn't it "confident"?

867
00:29:44,169 --> 00:29:47,668
(Is that a new type of pep talk?)

868
00:29:47,669 --> 00:29:49,499
- With style. - Be confidence itself.

869
00:29:49,500 --> 00:29:51,468
How is it that he rarely makes sense?

870
00:29:51,469 --> 00:29:52,885
He doesn't even know simple grammar.

871
00:29:53,510 --> 00:29:55,754
- Okay, I'll choose. - Just choose one.

872
00:29:56,040 --> 00:29:58,749
(Which number did Ji Hyo choose?)

873
00:29:58,750 --> 00:30:00,224
(They're keeping an eye on Kwang Soo.)

874
00:30:00,649 --> 00:30:02,254
(Is he trying to maintain a poker face?)

875
00:30:03,250 --> 00:30:04,749
- Two. - All right!

876
00:30:04,750 --> 00:30:05,789
(2 people!)

877
00:30:05,790 --> 00:30:07,358
- That's decent. - She's definitely better.

878
00:30:07,359 --> 00:30:09,519
- Two is better. - Definitely.

879
00:30:09,520 --> 00:30:10,529
Two...

880
00:30:10,530 --> 00:30:12,188
What are you so happy about?

881
00:30:12,189 --> 00:30:13,974
It's better than one, right?

882
00:30:14,560 --> 00:30:17,599
- Gosh. - The greedy pigs must be happy.

883
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:19,105
Exactly.

884
00:30:19,180 --> 00:30:21,719
- It's easy to hide who they are. - I know.

885
00:30:21,720 --> 00:30:24,719
This next mission is to decide who'll eat the food.

886
00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:26,719
It's called Conceal Your Lips.

887
00:30:26,720 --> 00:30:27,729
Lips?

888
00:30:27,730 --> 00:30:29,959
You will relay a word that fits the category...

889
00:30:29,960 --> 00:30:32,305
to the person next to you.

890
00:30:32,630 --> 00:30:34,199
No same words can be repeated,

891
00:30:34,200 --> 00:30:38,199
and you must hide your lips so that we can't see it.

892
00:30:38,200 --> 00:30:40,939
The category is food.

893
00:30:40,940 --> 00:30:42,184
Food?

894
00:30:42,470 --> 00:30:44,308
(The number 1 suspect Kwang Soo starts things off.)

895
00:30:44,309 --> 00:30:45,909
Carbonara tteokbokki.

896
00:30:45,910 --> 00:30:47,624
(Carbonara tteokbokki.)

897
00:30:48,710 --> 00:30:51,919
(Not laughing is essential since that's also another condition.)

898
00:30:51,920 --> 00:30:53,825
Bukchang-dong silken tofu.

899
00:30:54,650 --> 00:30:57,694
They all have good pronunciation.

900
00:30:57,819 --> 00:30:59,334
(Gosh...)

901
00:31:00,759 --> 00:31:02,265
Yes, I heard it too.

902
00:31:05,430 --> 00:31:07,005
(LA short ribs)

903
00:31:07,769 --> 00:31:09,104
LA short ribs.

904
00:31:11,569 --> 00:31:13,545
(I can't believe she didn't laugh.)

905
00:31:15,940 --> 00:31:17,755
Grandma's boiled pork.

906
00:31:19,240 --> 00:31:21,409
(Grandma's boiled pork)

907
00:31:21,410 --> 00:31:23,209
(Her jaws bounce up and down.)

908
00:31:23,210 --> 00:31:26,424
(She just put it out there and mentioned the brand.)

909
00:31:26,980 --> 00:31:27,989
What was that?

910
00:31:27,990 --> 00:31:29,194
(We can't laugh...)

911
00:31:30,150 --> 00:31:31,965
(Her teeth are showing.)

912
00:31:33,089 --> 00:31:34,758
(So Min's teeth are showing.)

913
00:31:34,759 --> 00:31:35,828
So Min's out.

914
00:31:35,829 --> 00:31:38,528
(So Min's out.)

915
00:31:38,529 --> 00:31:40,028
What? Why?

916
00:31:40,029 --> 00:31:42,129
Isn't it just the next person who can't laugh?

917
00:31:42,130 --> 00:31:44,139
I thought the rule only applied to the next person.

918
00:31:44,140 --> 00:31:45,899
- Seriously? - I didn't know.

919
00:31:45,900 --> 00:31:47,199
- I'm... - She's out.

920
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:48,308
- I... - Are you one of the greedy pigs?

921
00:31:48,309 --> 00:31:50,308
I thought it was just the next person...

922
00:31:50,309 --> 00:31:52,439
- who had to keep a poker face. - Anyway, you're out.

923
00:31:52,440 --> 00:31:53,739
- So Min, you're out. - I didn't know.

924
00:31:53,740 --> 00:31:56,278
- Your teeth showed. - Really?

925
00:31:56,279 --> 00:31:58,479
Anyway, we'll keep going starting with Ji Hyo.

926
00:31:58,480 --> 00:32:00,578
The category is food just like before.

927
00:32:00,579 --> 00:32:01,618
Gosh.

928
00:32:01,619 --> 00:32:03,325
(I need to keep a poker face.)

929
00:32:05,519 --> 00:32:07,558
Busan's soup and rice.

930
00:32:07,559 --> 00:32:09,429
(Busan's soup and rice)

931
00:32:09,430 --> 00:32:11,535
(Se Chan calms himself down mentally.)

932
00:32:12,108 --> 00:32:17,108
<font color="#fcc89b">[VIU Ver] SBS E475 Running Man</font>

<font color="#ff5fa2">-♥ Ruo Xi ♥-</font>

933
00:32:17,569 --> 00:32:18,739
Shark fin soup.

934

(Shark fin soup)

935
00:32:21,039 --> 00:32:23,015
Sinsa-dong marinated crabs.

936
00:32:23,410 --> 00:32:24,485
(Bring it on.)

937
00:32:25,210 --> 00:32:27,409
Pistachio and almonds.

938
00:32:27,410 --> 00:32:30,184
(Pistachio and almonds)

939
00:32:30,309 --> 00:32:33,278
What on earth was that? What did he say?

940
00:32:33,279 --> 00:32:34,749
"Pistachio and almonds."

941
00:32:34,750 --> 00:32:36,118
(Hyun Hee's out.)

942
00:32:36,119 --> 00:32:37,249
Hyun Hee, you're out.

943
00:32:37,250 --> 00:32:39,358
(Ji Hyun's next.)

944
00:32:39,359 --> 00:32:41,088
Haeundae short ribs.

945
00:32:41,089 --> 00:32:42,604
(Haeundae short ribs)

946
00:32:43,859 --> 00:32:47,005
(Seok Jin stays strong and withstands her attack.)

947
00:32:49,130 --> 00:32:51,545
- She's good. - She's just saying the brand.

948
00:32:52,140 --> 00:32:53,768
Let's go the other way around.

949
00:32:53,769 --> 00:32:55,045
We're going that way now.

950
00:32:55,140 --> 00:32:56,538
You'll be saying it to her.

951
00:32:56,539 --> 00:32:57,838
Is it my turn then?

952
00:32:57,839 --> 00:32:58,955
Go.

953
00:32:59,940 --> 00:33:01,749
Sindang-dong tteokbokki.

954
00:33:01,750 --> 00:33:02,979
(He yells just so that he could make her laugh.)

955
00:33:02,980 --> 00:33:04,894
Sindang-dong tteokbokki.

956
00:33:05,650 --> 00:33:06,719
Is it my turn?

957
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:08,489
(What type of food will the master name this time?)

958
00:33:08,490 --> 00:33:09,489
She's really good at this.

959
00:33:09,490 --> 00:33:10,795
(What type of food will the master name this time?)

960
00:33:11,019 --> 00:33:13,318
Im Chang Jung Corner Jokbal.

961
00:33:13,319 --> 00:33:14,434
(Im Chang Jung Corner Jokbal)

962
00:33:15,930 --> 00:33:19,575
(He bursts out laughing.)

963
00:33:21,730 --> 00:33:24,199
(She nearly gets them all.)

964
00:33:24,200 --> 00:33:25,939
Im Chang Jung Corner Jokbal.

965
00:33:25,940 --> 00:33:27,669
I didn't expect that.

966
00:33:27,670 --> 00:33:28,739
No way.

967
00:33:28,740 --> 00:33:30,268
She knows a lot of brand names.

968
00:33:30,269 --> 00:33:31,308
No one can beat her.

969
00:33:31,309 --> 00:33:34,215
It was like listening to an old lady from the Netherlands.

970
00:33:34,609 --> 00:33:36,209
(Park Ji Hyun can play an old lady from the Netherlands.)

971
00:33:36,210 --> 00:33:38,818
- No kidding. - She was like an old lady.

972
00:33:38,819 --> 00:33:39,818
My gosh.

973
00:33:39,819 --> 00:33:41,618
Her lips reached the back of her throat.

974
00:33:41,619 --> 00:33:43,889
Who knew she'd be this funny?

975
00:33:43,890 --> 00:33:45,118
(Others couldn't keep their laughter in.)

976
00:33:45,119 --> 00:33:47,629
(Haha is out.)

977
00:33:47,630 --> 00:33:50,929
(Ji Hyo is out.)

978
00:33:50,930 --> 00:33:53,729
(Kwang Soo is out.)

979
00:33:53,730 --> 00:33:54,999
(Only 4 remain.)

980
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:57,745
- Only two more to go. - Right.

981
00:33:57,940 --> 00:33:59,475
Go ahead.

982
00:33:59,900 --> 00:34:01,545
Ji Hyun's hilarious.

983
00:34:02,740 --> 00:34:05,639
She looks like a different person with her lips tucked in.

984
00:34:05,640 --> 00:34:07,409
I can't help but picture her face.

985
00:34:07,410 --> 00:34:08,649
Isn't she great at this?

986
00:34:08,650 --> 00:34:09,649
(We're reminded of the old lady from the Netherlands.)

987
00:34:09,650 --> 00:34:12,295
(He does his best.)

988
00:34:13,119 --> 00:34:15,348
(What is he saying?)

989
00:34:15,349 --> 00:34:17,189
- What? - What was that?

990
00:34:17,190 --> 00:34:18,359
What did he say?

991
00:34:18,360 --> 00:34:20,459
Coal grilled pork?

992
00:34:20,460 --> 00:34:22,459
Dongdu River budae stew.

993
00:34:22,460 --> 00:34:24,399
- What? - Just tell us what it is.

994
00:34:24,400 --> 00:34:25,399
What was that?

995
00:34:25,400 --> 00:34:27,129
- Dongdu River budae stew. - You're out.

996
00:34:27,130 --> 00:34:28,529
- Why? - You're out.

997
00:34:28,530 --> 00:34:30,268
Why? Dongdu River budae stew.

998
00:34:30,269 --> 00:34:32,344
- You're out. - Couldn't you hear it?

999
00:34:32,500 --> 00:34:34,408
- Ji Hyun's next. - You won't withstand this.

1000
00:34:34,409 --> 00:34:36,569
You can't. She's an expert at this.

1001
00:34:36,570 --> 00:34:38,538
Here comes the old lady from the Netherlands.

1002
00:34:38,539 --> 00:34:40,085
It's over if he laughs.

1003
00:34:41,480 --> 00:34:44,625
(He gets himself ready.)

1004
00:34:46,179 --> 00:34:47,395
Shake Shack burger.

1005
00:34:48,989 --> 00:34:50,995
(Shake Shack burger)

1006
00:34:51,559 --> 00:34:53,759
(They all stand up laughing.)

1007
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:55,835
(Laughing out loud)

1008
00:34:56,360 --> 00:34:58,359
This... I mean...

1009
00:34:58,360 --> 00:34:59,828
Are you kidding me?

1010
00:34:59,829 --> 00:35:01,428
- Do it again. - Gosh.

1011
00:35:01,429 --> 00:35:02,999
Ji Hyun, say it once again.

1012
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:04,544
Jong Kook, look at her.

1013
00:35:04,639 --> 00:35:05,768
Shake Shack burger.

1014
00:35:05,769 --> 00:35:09,714
(She's a force to be reckoned with.)

1015
00:35:10,639 --> 00:35:12,379
(She was able to take down Jong Kook too.)

1016
00:35:12,380 --> 00:35:13,939
How can you not laugh at that?

1017
00:35:13,940 --> 00:35:15,879
She's too wicked.

1018
00:35:15,880 --> 00:35:18,078
- You became an old lady. - How is this possible?

1019
00:35:18,079 --> 00:35:19,518
It was like watching a horror movie.

1020
00:35:19,519 --> 00:35:22,888
So the two that'll be eating the dish...

1021
00:35:22,889 --> 00:35:24,759
are Ji Hyun and Se Chan.

1022
00:35:24,760 --> 00:35:25,819
(Ji Hyun and Se Chan are able to eat.)

1023
00:35:25,820 --> 00:35:28,129
- Nice. - Those with chance cards,

1024
00:35:28,130 --> 00:35:29,558
will you activate them?

1025
00:35:29,559 --> 00:35:31,259
- Must we decide right now? - Yes.

1026
00:35:31,260 --> 00:35:32,899
Hyun Hee and Haha.

1027
00:35:32,900 --> 00:35:34,774
What's the dish?

1028
00:35:35,230 --> 00:35:37,029
Out of the dishes you saw, it'll be the octopus ramyeon.

1029
00:35:37,030 --> 00:35:40,075
Just the octopus ramyeon? Can we have a whole bowl?

1030
00:35:40,199 --> 00:35:42,009
- Just one bite. - With our chopsticks?

1031
00:35:42,010 --> 00:35:43,569
Just one bite?

1032
00:35:43,570 --> 00:35:45,915
I'll wait for the next dish.

1033
00:35:45,940 --> 00:35:46,939
I'll use mine.

1034
00:35:46,940 --> 00:35:49,379
Haha, Ji Hyun, Se Chan.

1035
00:35:49,380 --> 00:35:51,348
I'll let you know if there are greedy pigs.

1036
00:35:51,349 --> 00:35:52,348
(Is there a greedy pig among the 3?)

1037
00:35:52,349 --> 00:35:53,649
There are...

1038
00:35:53,650 --> 00:35:55,888
(Is there a greedy pig among the 3?)

1039
00:35:55,889 --> 00:35:57,089
no greedy pigs.

1040
00:35:57,090 --> 00:35:59,459
- See? - You get it now, right?

1041
00:35:59,460 --> 00:36:00,488
(There are no greedy pigs.)

1042
00:36:00,489 --> 00:36:02,129
- I knew it. - We lost a chance.

1043
00:36:02,130 --> 00:36:04,399
Everyone knows I'm not a greedy pig.

1044
00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:07,129
- That's right. - I can eat in peace now.

1045
00:36:07,130 --> 00:36:10,029
- None of us are a greedy pig then. - Okay.

1046
00:36:10,030 --> 00:36:11,138
- Never. - That's right.

1047
00:36:11,139 --> 00:36:13,245
- The suspect pool has shrunk. - A lot, actually.

1048
00:36:13,500 --> 00:36:15,038
Right.

1049
00:36:15,039 --> 00:36:16,585
How nice.

1050
00:36:17,309 --> 00:36:19,678
- Unbelievable. - One should eat the whole octopus.

1051
00:36:19,679 --> 00:36:21,085
My gosh.

1052
00:36:21,780 --> 00:36:23,585
It looks so good.

1053
00:36:23,710 --> 00:36:25,379
I'll enjoy some too then.

1054
00:36:25,380 --> 00:36:26,995
(This is the taste!)

1055
00:36:27,920 --> 00:36:30,618
- Haha needs to stack them up. - Is that allowed?

1056
00:36:30,619 --> 00:36:33,018
Gosh, the chance card is actually good.

1057
00:36:33,019 --> 00:36:34,234
Look.

1058
00:36:34,530 --> 00:36:36,129
(A symphony of octopus and boiled pork)

1059
00:36:36,130 --> 00:36:37,605
Gosh, what is he doing?

1060
00:36:37,730 --> 00:36:39,828
- Look. - That looks delicious.

1061
00:36:39,829 --> 00:36:42,404
Can I taste some and spit it out before I swallow?

1062
00:36:43,070 --> 00:36:44,669
- What? - It doesn't count as eating.

1063
00:36:44,670 --> 00:36:46,098
This is hard to tolerate.

1064
00:36:46,099 --> 00:36:48,939
We should've done a better job in the first game.

1065
00:36:48,940 --> 00:36:51,738
- Why ruin a perfectly good chance? - It was difficult.

1066
00:36:51,739 --> 00:36:53,908
- Exactly. - Must you put it that way though?

1067
00:36:53,909 --> 00:36:54,948
It wasn't on purpose.

1068
00:36:54,949 --> 00:36:57,154
- Why ruin... - Is the llama from the woods back?

1069
00:36:57,949 --> 00:36:59,919
Didn't he have his name tag on his belly?

1070
00:36:59,920 --> 00:37:00,919
That's right.

1071
00:37:00,920 --> 00:37:02,018
(After their meal...)

1072
00:37:02,019 --> 00:37:03,964
I hope we'll be offered a meat dish next.

1073
00:37:04,460 --> 00:37:05,459
I'm full.

1074
00:37:05,460 --> 00:37:07,928
We have to win the number game first.

1075
00:37:07,929 --> 00:37:09,529
I know.

1076
00:37:09,530 --> 00:37:11,875
- We could all eat. - Yes, and then...

1077
00:37:12,460 --> 00:37:13,729
we can see who doesn't eat.

1078
00:37:13,730 --> 00:37:15,928
Whoever they are got lucky this time.

1079
00:37:15,929 --> 00:37:17,129
- There are 10 of us. - Congratulations.

1080
00:37:17,130 --> 00:37:18,814
Greedy pig, you got lucky.

1081
00:37:19,239 --> 00:37:20,475
Unbelievable.

1082
00:37:21,039 --> 00:37:23,669
We can safely rule out those three though.

1083
00:37:23,670 --> 00:37:26,038
- Right. - It's hard not to eat, right?

1084
00:37:26,039 --> 00:37:28,049
- Right. - Exactly.

1085
00:37:28,050 --> 00:37:29,524
Ji Hyun, you seem to like food.

1086
00:37:29,650 --> 00:37:30,649
Yes, I do.

1087
00:37:30,650 --> 00:37:31,819
Exactly.

1088
00:37:31,820 --> 00:37:33,879
- That's always nice. - I think she eats well.

1089
00:37:33,880 --> 00:37:34,988
She likes eating.

1090
00:37:34,989 --> 00:37:37,749
Foodies who don't gain weight always seem charming.

1091
00:37:37,750 --> 00:37:38,819
Right.

1092
00:37:38,820 --> 00:37:40,189
- You see... - I easily gain weight though.

1093
00:37:40,190 --> 00:37:42,359
- What? - I easily gain weight though.

1094
00:37:42,360 --> 00:37:44,605
(She groaned from deep within.)

1095
00:37:45,030 --> 00:37:46,029
What...

1096
00:37:46,030 --> 00:37:48,105
Don't you hate soulless responses like that?

1097
00:37:48,230 --> 00:37:50,129
- I know. - Can't they just be honest?

1098
00:37:50,130 --> 00:37:51,669
- Just say you're being careful. - Don't you?

1099
00:37:51,670 --> 00:37:53,368
I want to hear them say...

1100
00:37:53,369 --> 00:37:55,509
that they don't eat after 6 p.m. and work out every day.

1101
00:37:55,510 --> 00:37:58,308
I used to weigh 78kg.

1102
00:37:58,309 --> 00:38:00,055
- What? - Really?

1103
00:38:00,280 --> 00:38:01,678
- So you went on a diet? - She worked hard.

1104
00:38:01,679 --> 00:38:02,808
That's close to my weight.

1105
00:38:02,809 --> 00:38:04,518
When was that? In high school?

1106
00:38:04,519 --> 00:38:06,249
- When I was 20. - 20 years old?

1107
00:38:06,250 --> 00:38:08,018
Yes, right after high school.

1108
00:38:08,019 --> 00:38:10,118
- So you lost the weight. - How did you do it?

1109
00:38:10,119 --> 00:38:12,259
I ate less and worked out.

1110
00:38:12,260 --> 00:38:14,319
- You should see Hyun Hee's... - No wonder she has a small face.

1111
00:38:14,320 --> 00:38:15,828
See her wedding photos.

1112
00:38:15,829 --> 00:38:17,558
- I lost 10kg for my wedding. - Really?

1113
00:38:17,559 --> 00:38:19,558
She lost the weight and I couldn't recognize her.

1114
00:38:19,559 --> 00:38:21,229
- Really? - That was me at 59kg.

1115
00:38:21,230 --> 00:38:22,999
You should look up the photo.

1116
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:26,075
I love female comedians though. They're so charming.

1117
00:38:26,099 --> 00:38:27,638
- Right. - They're funny.

1118
00:38:27,639 --> 00:38:29,939
My in-laws love me because I bring laughter.

1119
00:38:29,940 --> 00:38:31,209
That's right.

1120
00:38:31,210 --> 00:38:32,839
Father, join me!

1121
00:38:32,840 --> 00:38:34,654
(Let's get it!)

1122
00:38:35,150 --> 00:38:36,808
(Father, laugh with me!)

1123
00:38:36,809 --> 00:38:38,879
- Do you really do that? - Yes, to my father-in-law.

1124
00:38:38,880 --> 00:38:41,694
He loves how I lighten up the atmosphere.

1125
00:38:42,190 --> 00:38:43,919
- He wants to live laughing. - 15 years.

1126
00:38:43,920 --> 00:38:45,888
- 15 years? - I'll take care of it.

1127
00:38:45,889 --> 00:38:47,194
- What? My life? - Yes.

1128
00:38:47,829 --> 00:38:49,529
- Okay? - What's the plan then?

1129
00:38:49,530 --> 00:38:51,529
- "Same Life, Unlike Dreams"? - Then "The Return of Superman".

1130
00:38:51,530 --> 00:38:53,935
- "The Return of Superman"? - "Taste of Wife".

1131
00:38:54,099 --> 00:38:55,299
And then "Son-in-law".

1132
00:38:55,300 --> 00:38:57,975
Then I'll let you be on "Burning Youth".

1133
00:38:58,900 --> 00:39:00,299
She said she'll let you go.

1134
00:39:00,300 --> 00:39:02,569
You've got to be kidding me.

1135
00:39:02,570 --> 00:39:04,185
She'll let me go.

1136
00:39:04,710 --> 00:39:05,814
We must be here.

1137
00:39:06,480 --> 00:39:08,609
It must be western cuisine. Are we having wine?

1138
00:39:08,610 --> 00:39:10,509
- Look. - This place is fancy.

1139
00:39:10,510 --> 00:39:12,879
I already smell something delicious.

1140
00:39:12,880 --> 00:39:14,448
- What? - What's this?

1141
00:39:14,449 --> 00:39:17,089
The next dish is pasta made with blue crabs.

1142
00:39:17,090 --> 00:39:19,319
Blue crabs are good for the skin and at preventing dementia.

1143
00:39:19,320 --> 00:39:21,234
This we must have!

1144
00:39:21,429 --> 00:39:23,658
- Seok Jin, let's eat this. - I want to.

1145
00:39:23,659 --> 00:39:25,158
- It prevents Alzheimer's. - Right.

1146
00:39:25,159 --> 00:39:26,799
Please sit down.

1147
00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:29,174
(They're about to sit down and start the mission.)

1148
00:39:29,429 --> 00:39:32,339
(So Min sits next to Se Chan.)

1149
00:39:32,340 --> 00:39:33,538
- You... - Hey.

1150
00:39:33,539 --> 00:39:36,038
- You sat next to me. - I didn't.

1151
00:39:36,039 --> 00:39:39,209
Why do you always sit next to each other?

1152
00:39:39,210 --> 00:39:40,484
- I mean... - She...

1153
00:39:40,510 --> 00:39:42,085
She sat next to me.

1154
00:39:42,150 --> 00:39:43,848
I sat here first, and she came and sat next to me.

1155
00:39:43,849 --> 00:39:45,094
(What are they bickering about it this time?)

1156
00:39:45,619 --> 00:39:48,024
(On the way here...)

1157
00:39:49,190 --> 00:39:51,125
- Why did you hold my hand? - What?

1158
00:39:51,989 --> 00:39:53,589
(Se Chan holds So Min's hand.)

1159
00:39:53,590 --> 00:39:55,029
Why did you hold my hand?

1160
00:39:55,030 --> 00:39:56,058
(There they go again.)

1161
00:39:56,059 --> 00:39:57,129
Why did you hold my hand?

1162
00:39:57,130 --> 00:39:59,375
Why do you keep holding So Min's hand?

1163
00:39:59,530 --> 00:40:02,129
He put his hand on mine and stayed that way.

1164
00:40:02,130 --> 00:40:03,768
I was surprised, so I pulled my hand away.

1165
00:40:03,769 --> 00:40:06,368
- I had no idea. - Be careful.

1166
00:40:06,369 --> 00:40:08,968
- You didn't feel my fingers? - No.

1167
00:40:08,969 --> 00:40:11,384
You can't sit next to me anymore.

1168
00:40:12,010 --> 00:40:14,285
- Not during the mission either. - Fine.

1169
00:40:14,780 --> 00:40:16,009
You two sit next to each other all the time.

1170
00:40:16,010 --> 00:40:18,495
- This is my seat. - This is my seat too.

1171
00:40:18,849 --> 00:40:20,455
What's going on between them?

1172
00:40:20,579 --> 00:40:23,288
This time, four people can eat.

1173
00:40:23,289 --> 00:40:25,165
Let's decide who can eat by playing a game.

1174
00:40:25,590 --> 00:40:27,794
- Call My Name. - Call My Name?

1175
00:40:27,989 --> 00:40:30,205
Do you remember the game where you guessed the person?

1176
00:40:30,989 --> 00:40:32,205
We'll play that game.

1177
00:40:32,329 --> 00:40:34,629
(You have to guess the name on your head by asking questions.)

1178
00:40:34,630 --> 00:40:35,844
(He wears oversized clothes.)

1179
00:40:36,170 --> 00:40:38,415
(Oversized clothes?)

1180
00:40:38,769 --> 00:40:40,745
- Let me answer. Dracula. - Correct.

1181
00:40:41,139 --> 00:40:44,214
(You have to ask the right questions and think fast.)

1182
00:40:44,440 --> 00:40:46,714
I'm not even a greedy pig. I don't want to mess up.

1183
00:40:47,409 --> 00:40:48,408
Let's sit down.

1184
00:40:48,409 --> 00:40:51,279
If Kwang Soo is our player, we shouldn't expect to eat.

1185
00:40:51,280 --> 00:40:52,549
I'll do my best.

1186
00:40:52,550 --> 00:40:53,779
- Kwang Soo. - Yes?

1187
00:40:53,780 --> 00:40:54,819
- Let's eat. - Sure.

1188
00:40:54,820 --> 00:40:56,265
- Let's eat, Kwang Soo! - Okay!

1189
00:40:56,550 --> 00:40:59,364
- It'll be a tight game. - It will be.

1190
00:40:59,389 --> 00:41:00,694
It's not going to be easy.

1191
00:41:01,059 --> 00:41:03,535
Give them to me. Should I hand them out randomly?

1192
00:41:05,730 --> 00:41:07,129
That's easy.

1193
00:41:07,130 --> 00:41:08,399
(Kwang Soo gets Baek Jong Won.)

1194
00:41:08,400 --> 00:41:11,344
(Jong Kook gets Santa Claus.)

1195
00:41:12,300 --> 00:41:14,415
(Surprised)

1196
00:41:14,940 --> 00:41:17,339
(Ji Hyo gets...)

1197
00:41:17,340 --> 00:41:18,555
(Kwak Cheol Yong.)

1198
00:41:19,210 --> 00:41:21,479
(He was a scene-stealer in "Tazza".)

1199
00:41:21,480 --> 00:41:25,625
(Many of Kwak Cheol Yong's lines in the movie have become famous.)

1200
00:41:25,719 --> 00:41:28,125
- Let's go. - That's too easy.

1201
00:41:28,789 --> 00:41:30,118
- Let's do this! - I'll get it right!

1202
00:41:30,119 --> 00:41:31,265
Let's go!

1203
00:41:31,860 --> 00:41:33,134
What's my gender?

1204
00:41:33,489 --> 00:41:34,634
It's...

1205
00:41:34,889 --> 00:41:36,535
- not clear. - Really?

1206
00:41:36,860 --> 00:41:38,805
You can't say that.

1207
00:41:38,900 --> 00:41:40,705
Why is it not clear?

1208
00:41:40,929 --> 00:41:41,999
What?

1209
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:43,368
- Why is it not clear? - You can't lie.

1210
00:41:43,369 --> 00:41:45,499
- You can't lie. - Fine. You're a man.

1211
00:41:45,500 --> 00:41:47,138
- Hey, hit him. - You're a man.

1212
00:41:47,139 --> 00:41:48,808
Was it unclear because you've never seen him naked?

1213
00:41:48,809 --> 00:41:50,839
(Was it unclear because you've never seen him naked?)

1214
00:41:50,840 --> 00:41:52,015
Hey.

1215
00:41:52,780 --> 00:41:54,515
- What? - How...

1216
00:41:54,980 --> 00:41:56,979
I'm just saying.

1217
00:41:56,980 --> 00:41:58,125
What's with him?

1218
00:41:58,880 --> 00:42:00,355
He destroyed my innocence.

1219
00:42:00,780 --> 00:42:02,725
Am I a man or a woman?

1220
00:42:03,320 --> 00:42:05,335
- You're a man. - You're a man.

1221
00:42:05,489 --> 00:42:06,959
Jong Kook is straightforward.

1222
00:42:06,960 --> 00:42:08,864
- Of course. You shouldn't lie. - He gives an answer right away.

1223
00:42:10,460 --> 00:42:11,634
Am I rich?

1224
00:42:11,960 --> 00:42:13,399
(That's a good question.)

1225
00:42:13,400 --> 00:42:16,669
I've never seen his bank books, so I have no idea.

1226
00:42:16,670 --> 00:42:17,899
(I've never seen his bank books.)

1227
00:42:17,900 --> 00:42:19,468
- What are you talking about? - It's true.

1228
00:42:19,469 --> 00:42:21,138
We can't know that.

1229
00:42:21,139 --> 00:42:22,984
- We can't know that. - We can't.

1230
00:42:23,239 --> 00:42:24,738
That's...

1231
00:42:24,739 --> 00:42:26,209
(Jong Kook avoids answering the clever question.)

1232
00:42:26,210 --> 00:42:27,384
What's...

1233
00:42:27,940 --> 00:42:29,125
my occupation?

1234
00:42:29,480 --> 00:42:30,549
(Impressed)

1235
00:42:30,550 --> 00:42:32,348
- It's hard to say. - In my opinion,

1236
00:42:32,349 --> 00:42:34,094
- I think he is... - Just give me one.

1237
00:42:34,119 --> 00:42:35,819
- a volunteer worker. - Well said.

1238
00:42:35,820 --> 00:42:37,649
(A volunteer worker)

1239
00:42:37,650 --> 00:42:38,919
(Santa Claus does volunteer work for children.)

1240
00:42:38,920 --> 00:42:40,064
Well said.

1241
00:42:40,960 --> 00:42:42,205
He donates a lot too.

1242
00:42:44,429 --> 00:42:45,558
He donates?

1243
00:42:45,559 --> 00:42:47,158
(He donates presents around the end of the year.)

1244
00:42:47,159 --> 00:42:48,404
- That makes sense. - That's hard.

1245
00:42:49,130 --> 00:42:50,404
It's true.

1246
00:42:50,630 --> 00:42:51,944
What's my occupation then?

1247
00:42:52,269 --> 00:42:54,399
(A "gambler" would be too direct.)

1248
00:42:54,400 --> 00:42:56,138
You're a romantic.

1249
00:42:56,139 --> 00:42:58,714
(You're a romantic.)

1250
00:42:59,340 --> 00:43:00,614
A romantic?

1251
00:43:01,010 --> 00:43:02,249
His occupation is a romantic?

1252
00:43:02,250 --> 00:43:03,308
(He has a real occupation though.)

1253
00:43:03,309 --> 00:43:04,479
- A romantic... - He is a romantic.

1254
00:43:04,480 --> 00:43:06,424
I know what you mean.

1255
00:43:06,679 --> 00:43:08,094
I know why you said that.

1256
00:43:08,719 --> 00:43:10,049
You're a CEO.

1257
00:43:10,050 --> 00:43:11,634
That's right. You're a CEO.

1258
00:43:12,119 --> 00:43:13,395
Does he have a construction company?

1259
00:43:14,090 --> 00:43:16,165
- Construction? - Are you sure?

1260
00:43:16,289 --> 00:43:17,959
I think it's finance.

1261
00:43:17,960 --> 00:43:18,959
(He's a gambler.)

1262
00:43:18,960 --> 00:43:20,305
- He's in finance. - Let me give you a bigger hint.

1263
00:43:20,800 --> 00:43:23,669
He started his business at an early age.

1264
00:43:23,670 --> 00:43:25,915
(He started his business at an early age.)

1265
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:27,799
That's right. That's actually right!

1266
00:43:27,800 --> 00:43:29,908
- That's right. - He started at an early age.

1267
00:43:29,909 --> 00:43:31,484
That's right.

1268
00:43:31,679 --> 00:43:34,585
("I joined the gang at 17.")

1269
00:43:35,309 --> 00:43:37,879
(After starting at 17, he climbed up to the top.)

1270
00:43:37,880 --> 00:43:39,018
That's right.

1271
00:43:39,019 --> 00:43:40,254
(Good shot, Kwang Soo.)

1272
00:43:40,280 --> 00:43:42,149
That hint was too crucial.

1273
00:43:42,150 --> 00:43:44,488
- I just gave you a big hint. - It was too big.

1274
00:43:44,489 --> 00:43:45,959
It really was a big hint.

1275
00:43:45,960 --> 00:43:47,658
I'm on Ji Hyo's team, but I admit it.

1276
00:43:47,659 --> 00:43:49,928
- You admit it, right? - I have to.

1277
00:43:49,929 --> 00:43:51,129
Let me ask you a question.

1278
00:43:51,130 --> 00:43:53,375
Have I been on any variety shows?

1279
00:43:53,730 --> 00:43:55,698
(Santa Claus on variety shows?)

1280
00:43:55,699 --> 00:43:56,899
- Yes. - I've seen it.

1281
00:43:56,900 --> 00:43:58,004
Me too.

1282
00:43:58,300 --> 00:44:00,114
A volunteer worker appears on variety shows?

1283
00:44:01,139 --> 00:44:02,968
(He often does.)

1284
00:44:02,969 --> 00:44:04,308
I've seen it many times.

1285
00:44:04,309 --> 00:44:05,479
Really?

1286
00:44:05,480 --> 00:44:06,785
- It's a big hint. - Let me answer.

1287
00:44:07,809 --> 00:44:09,649
(A male volunteer worker who appears on variety shows?)

1288
00:44:09,650 --> 00:44:11,249
(Will Jong Kook get it right?)

1289
00:44:11,250 --> 00:44:12,395
Sean.

1290
00:44:13,579 --> 00:44:15,194
- It's a big hint. - Let me answer. Sean.

1291
00:44:15,389 --> 00:44:19,189
(Sean is a volunteer worker who appears on variety shows.)

1292
00:44:19,190 --> 00:44:20,294
Let me give you a big hint.

1293
00:44:20,659 --> 00:44:21,959
The beneficiaries of his donations aren't decided.

1294
00:44:21,960 --> 00:44:23,504
- They aren't decided? - No.

1295
00:44:23,590 --> 00:44:24,765
They're not decided beforehand.

1296
00:44:25,599 --> 00:44:27,129
- I disagree. - The scope is pretty big.

1297
00:44:27,130 --> 00:44:28,299
- I don't think so. - Give me another answer.

1298
00:44:28,300 --> 00:44:29,444
I disagree.

1299
00:44:29,469 --> 00:44:30,629
The beneficiaries are decided.

1300
00:44:30,630 --> 00:44:31,839
- They are. - There is a specific group.

1301
00:44:31,840 --> 00:44:33,375
- There is a specific age group. - A specific age group.

1302
00:44:33,400 --> 00:44:35,069
- A specific age group? - No.

1303
00:44:35,070 --> 00:44:36,538
- You shouldn't say that. - No.

1304
00:44:36,539 --> 00:44:37,738
That's not okay.

1305
00:44:37,739 --> 00:44:39,285
- Hit So Min once. - An age group?

1306
00:44:39,340 --> 00:44:43,254
I still get it sometimes.

1307
00:44:43,909 --> 00:44:45,055
Let me answer.

1308
00:44:46,550 --> 00:44:48,725
(Did he get it?)

1309
00:44:49,920 --> 00:44:51,125
Santa Claus.

1310
00:44:51,920 --> 00:44:54,058
(Correct)

1311
00:44:54,059 --> 00:44:56,629
- It's your fault. - She said an "age group".

1312
00:44:56,630 --> 00:44:58,229
Haha gave it away.

1313
00:44:58,230 --> 00:44:59,729
- He's still a child. - Haha gave it away.

1314
00:44:59,730 --> 00:45:01,274
- He said it... - Is it my fault?

1315
00:45:01,360 --> 00:45:03,198
"I still get it sometimes" gave it away.

1316
00:45:03,199 --> 00:45:05,875
Why couldn't you be more careful?

1317
00:45:06,469 --> 00:45:09,638
We should have been on Jong Kook's team.

1318
00:45:09,639 --> 00:45:11,085
I'll get it right.

1319
00:45:11,110 --> 00:45:12,214
I have to.

1320
00:45:12,909 --> 00:45:15,549
Does he have any famous quote?

1321
00:45:15,550 --> 00:45:17,178
(Does he have any famous quote?)

1322
00:45:17,179 --> 00:45:18,285
A quote?

1323
00:45:19,250 --> 00:45:21,788
I think there are many.

1324
00:45:21,789 --> 00:45:22,888
Say something.

1325
00:45:22,889 --> 00:45:24,094
Try to sound like him.

1326
00:45:24,389 --> 00:45:26,194
That'd be too easy.

1327
00:45:26,420 --> 00:45:27,594
Say something.

1328
00:45:27,760 --> 00:45:28,759
A quote?

1329
00:45:28,760 --> 00:45:31,058
(This might put everything to an end.)

1330
00:45:31,059 --> 00:45:32,335
This is...

1331
00:45:32,960 --> 00:45:34,575
If I said anything else,

1332
00:45:34,800 --> 00:45:37,305
it'd be against the rules, so I'll just say it.

1333
00:45:37,369 --> 00:45:39,768
(Which line will Kwang Soo say?)

1334
00:45:39,769 --> 00:45:40,868
Double...

1335
00:45:40,869 --> 00:45:44,038
(Double...)

1336
00:45:44,039 --> 00:45:46,178
(We win!)

1337
00:45:46,179 --> 00:45:48,649
That's too easy.

1338
00:45:48,650 --> 00:45:50,024
Hey, that's too easy.

1339
00:45:51,750 --> 00:45:52,819
(Ji Hyo remembers.)

1340
00:45:52,820 --> 00:45:54,754
- Oh, no! - Say the answer, Ji Hyo!

1341
00:45:55,519 --> 00:45:56,819
Did you get it?

1342
00:45:56,820 --> 00:45:57,964
Say the answer, Ji Hyo!

1343
00:45:58,489 --> 00:46:01,558
(Was my hint too easy?)

1344
00:46:01,559 --> 00:46:03,058
(As soon as Ji Hyo heard, "double",)

1345
00:46:03,059 --> 00:46:05,058
(she got up.)

1346
00:46:05,059 --> 00:46:07,999
(Will Ji Hyo say, "Kwak Cheol Yong"?)

1347
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:09,468
I don't remember his name!

1348
00:46:09,469 --> 00:46:12,614
(I don't remember his name!)

1349
00:46:12,739 --> 00:46:14,499
(Celebrating)

1350
00:46:14,500 --> 00:46:15,709
What?

1351
00:46:15,710 --> 00:46:17,214
(They can't believe it.)

1352
00:46:17,340 --> 00:46:18,814
What is this?

1353
00:46:19,579 --> 00:46:22,524
- "I'm a romantic." - She doesn't remember his name.

1354
00:46:22,750 --> 00:46:24,085
Gosh, I can't believe this.

1355
00:46:25,119 --> 00:46:26,355
I go double!

1356
00:46:28,050 --> 00:46:29,194
(I go double!)

1357
00:46:29,989 --> 00:46:32,089
(Here's a quote.)

1358
00:46:32,090 --> 00:46:33,218
Sit down.

1359
00:46:33,219 --> 00:46:35,535
(Annoyed)

1360
00:46:36,489 --> 00:46:38,875
(I guess we'll win.)

1361
00:46:39,400 --> 00:46:41,259
(This is not good.)

1362
00:46:41,260 --> 00:46:43,605
This is the worst possible situation.

1363
00:46:44,230 --> 00:46:46,515
- This is crazy. - Ask one last question.

1364
00:46:47,539 --> 00:46:49,814
- She knows his face. - Ask for a quote.

1365
00:46:49,969 --> 00:46:51,884
What's my famous quote?

1366
00:46:52,579 --> 00:46:54,654
You have many famous quotes. "I go double."

1367
00:46:54,710 --> 00:46:56,384
"Has Mapo Bridge collapsed?"

1368
00:46:57,309 --> 00:46:58,995
"I'm a romantic."

1369
00:46:59,449 --> 00:47:01,988
(The quotes don't help Ji Hyo remember his name.)

1370
00:47:01,989 --> 00:47:03,495
"I'm a romantic."

1371
00:47:03,820 --> 00:47:04,988
What's my famous quote?

1372
00:47:04,989 --> 00:47:07,194
(What's Baek Jong Won's famous quote?)

1373
00:47:07,619 --> 00:47:10,765
(Well...)

1374
00:47:11,460 --> 00:47:13,004
That's enough.

1375
00:47:13,130 --> 00:47:14,504
You've done enough. You can stop.

1376
00:47:14,860 --> 00:47:17,098
- She should stop? - She should stop here?

1377
00:47:17,099 --> 00:47:19,444
Kwang Soo said, "I go double", and Ji Hyo should stop here?

1378
00:47:19,500 --> 00:47:21,415
- This should be enough. - I agree.

1379
00:47:22,039 --> 00:47:23,214
- "Well..." - Stop.

1380
00:47:24,369 --> 00:47:25,614
She crossed her arms.

1381
00:47:26,409 --> 00:47:27,654
Ask a question.

1382
00:47:28,210 --> 00:47:29,325
This person...

1383
00:47:29,880 --> 00:47:33,678
(She needs to remember his name, Kwak Cheol Yong.)

1384
00:47:33,679 --> 00:47:35,094
Give me a hint...

1385
00:47:36,050 --> 00:47:37,325
about his last name.

1386
00:47:38,219 --> 00:47:39,419
The actor's name is Kim Eung Soo.

1387
00:47:39,420 --> 00:47:41,265
(He makes it clear that it's Kwak Cheol Yong.)

1388
00:47:41,690 --> 00:47:45,029
(He even says the actor's name.)

1389
00:47:45,030 --> 00:47:47,098
(Kwang Soo says everything except the character's name.)

1390
00:47:47,099 --> 00:47:48,529
And what you have on your head is the character's name.

1391
00:47:48,530 --> 00:47:49,729
(He gives an additional hint.)

1392
00:47:49,730 --> 00:47:52,899
(Why can't you still remember the name, Kwak Cheol Yong?)

1393
00:47:52,900 --> 00:47:54,499
She still doesn't remember.

1394
00:47:54,500 --> 00:47:56,544
- This is... - He's really popular these days.

1395
00:47:56,940 --> 00:47:58,344
I know he's popular.

1396
00:47:58,480 --> 00:48:00,109
This is driving me crazy.

1397
00:48:00,110 --> 00:48:01,948
Both of you failed. The correct answers are...

1398
00:48:01,949 --> 00:48:03,009
(Both Ji Hyo and Kwang Soo failed to win a point.)

1399
00:48:03,010 --> 00:48:04,524
Baek Jong Won and Kwak Cheol Yong.

1400
00:48:05,650 --> 00:48:08,178
(Baek Jong Won and Kwak Cheol Yong)

1401
00:48:08,179 --> 00:48:09,495
It was Baek Jong Won.

1402
00:48:09,690 --> 00:48:11,725
Only Team White won a point.

1403
00:48:11,760 --> 00:48:13,888
- Let's move on to Round Two. - Okay!

1404
00:48:13,889 --> 00:48:15,089
This is going well.

1405
00:48:15,090 --> 00:48:16,859
(Who will play Round 2?)

1406
00:48:16,860 --> 00:48:19,075
My opponents are not easy.

1407
00:48:19,730 --> 00:48:21,768
- We narrow down the answers, right? - Yes.

1408
00:48:21,769 --> 00:48:23,198
- Like 20 Questions. - Exactly.

1409
00:48:23,199 --> 00:48:25,044
We'll narrow down the answers like when playing 20 questions.

1410
00:48:25,469 --> 00:48:26,598
Close your eyes.

1411
00:48:26,599 --> 00:48:28,569
(Who are the people they have to guess?)

1412
00:48:28,570 --> 00:48:31,839
(Hyun Hee gets Michael Jackson.)

1413
00:48:31,840 --> 00:48:34,714
(Ji Hyun gets Gummy.)

1414
00:48:35,650 --> 00:48:37,984
- Goodness. - That's not good.

1415
00:48:38,519 --> 00:48:39,725
Poor Se Chan.

1416
00:48:39,726 --> 00:48:42,259
(Who is the person that Se Chan have to guess?)

1417
00:48:43,519 --> 00:48:44,725
Poor Se Chan.

1418
00:48:44,850 --> 00:48:47,948
(Se Chan gets Gautama Buddha.)

1419
00:48:47,949 --> 00:48:49,548
(What is it?)

1420
00:48:49,549 --> 00:48:50,964
- Se Chan, look at me. - Why?

1421
00:48:51,319 --> 00:48:52,758
Look at me.

1422
00:48:52,759 --> 00:48:53,834
Why?

1423
00:48:53,960 --> 00:48:55,834
(Why? What is it?)

1424
00:48:56,309 --> 00:48:57,824
Let me ask a question first.

1425
00:48:58,050 --> 00:48:59,449
Is this a word I know?

1426
00:48:59,450 --> 00:49:02,049
(Is this a word I know?)

1427
00:49:02,050 --> 00:49:03,149
(He checks the difficulty of the answer.)

1428
00:49:03,150 --> 00:49:06,025
Is this a word I know? What do you think?

1429
00:49:06,189 --> 00:49:08,659
(Is this a word I know? What do you think?)

1430
00:49:08,660 --> 00:49:09,859
It would be difficult not to know.

1431
00:49:09,860 --> 00:49:11,429
It would be difficult not to know?

1432
00:49:11,430 --> 00:49:13,288
I think you would get confused.

1433
00:49:13,289 --> 00:49:15,304
I would get confused? It must be an advanced word.

1434
00:49:16,229 --> 00:49:18,328
It must be an advanced word. Okay.

1435
00:49:18,329 --> 00:49:20,598
- It could be an advanced word. - I see.

1436
00:49:20,599 --> 00:49:21,815
It could be an advanced word.

1437
00:49:22,340 --> 00:49:23,475
Am I a person?

1438
00:49:23,599 --> 00:49:25,668
This is a game where you guess the person.

1439
00:49:25,669 --> 00:49:27,078
(The producer steps in.)

1440
00:49:27,079 --> 00:49:28,685
(Embarrassed)

1441
00:49:28,809 --> 00:49:30,085
What was that?

1442
00:49:30,849 --> 00:49:34,355
(Hyun Hee, let's concentrate.)

1443
00:49:34,380 --> 00:49:37,165
That was a lousy question.

1444
00:49:37,689 --> 00:49:39,018
She surprised me.

1445
00:49:39,019 --> 00:49:40,735
- All right. - Am I a foreigner?

1446
00:49:41,490 --> 00:49:42,634
Yes.

1447
00:49:42,789 --> 00:49:43,958
- Am I a foreigner? - Yes.

1448
00:49:43,959 --> 00:49:45,335
That's one question. You are done.

1449
00:49:46,189 --> 00:49:48,835
Am I Korean?

1450
00:49:48,930 --> 00:49:50,668
- My goodness. - It's hard.

1451
00:49:50,669 --> 00:49:52,069
- Is it hard? - It's hard.

1452
00:49:52,070 --> 00:49:53,069
It's really hard.

1453
00:49:53,070 --> 00:49:56,469
As far as I know, you have several nationalities.

1454
00:49:56,470 --> 00:49:58,344
I have several nationalities? Several citizenships?

1455
00:49:58,910 --> 00:50:00,554
Several nationalities?

1456
00:50:00,610 --> 00:50:02,538
Isn't this person genderless?

1457
00:50:02,539 --> 00:50:04,009
How could I be genderless?

1458
00:50:04,010 --> 00:50:05,509
- He has a gender. - He has a gender.

1459
00:50:05,510 --> 00:50:06,824
- Of course. - Really?

1460
00:50:07,380 --> 00:50:10,018
Do the two of you know who this person is?

1461
00:50:10,019 --> 00:50:11,764
(Do the two of you know who this person is?)

1462
00:50:11,919 --> 00:50:13,688
Gosh, give me...

1463
00:50:13,689 --> 00:50:14,888
a different person.

1464
00:50:14,889 --> 00:50:17,165
I might be the one who knows.

1465
00:50:17,329 --> 00:50:19,534
You are an influencer.

1466
00:50:19,630 --> 00:50:21,598
- What is that? - Isn't that right?

1467
00:50:21,599 --> 00:50:23,199
- That's right. - What's "Influenza"? "Influenza".

1468
00:50:23,200 --> 00:50:25,228
(Whispering)

1469
00:50:25,229 --> 00:50:27,498
He said "Influencer", not "Influenza".

1470
00:50:27,499 --> 00:50:31,085
(He said "Influencer", not "Influenza".)

1471
00:50:31,269 --> 00:50:32,438
(For goodness' sake!)

1472
00:50:32,439 --> 00:50:34,679
- He is so stupid. - I didn't hear him.

1473
00:50:34,680 --> 00:50:35,915
("Influencer" is a word that is too advanced for Se Chan.)

1474
00:50:36,010 --> 00:50:38,284
I have babies, right?

1475
00:50:38,809 --> 00:50:40,009
Babies?

1476
00:50:40,010 --> 00:50:41,719
(Michael Jackson has children.)

1477
00:50:41,720 --> 00:50:43,618
- I have children, right? - Yes.

1478
00:50:43,619 --> 00:50:44,649
You have children.

1479
00:50:44,650 --> 00:50:46,565
- Okay. - Do you know the answer?

1480
00:50:46,650 --> 00:50:48,489
- Hyun Hee must have an idea. - Do you have an idea?

1481
00:50:48,490 --> 00:50:49,918
You can blurt out the answer.

1482
00:50:49,919 --> 00:50:50,958
It's okay if you get it wrong.

1483
00:50:50,959 --> 00:50:52,259
Sam Hammington?

1484
00:50:52,260 --> 00:50:53,799
(Is the answer Sam Hammington?)

1485
00:50:53,800 --> 00:50:55,399
(Everyone bursts out laughing.)

1486
00:50:55,400 --> 00:50:56,529
Sam Hammington!

1487
00:50:56,530 --> 00:50:58,498
(Sam Hammington is the epitome of a foreigner with children.)

1488
00:50:58,499 --> 00:51:00,168
I didn't expect that one.

1489
00:51:00,169 --> 00:51:01,875
Sam Hammington.

1490
00:51:02,970 --> 00:51:04,668
- Sam Hammington! - I didn't expect that one.

1491
00:51:04,669 --> 00:51:05,915
I will ask a sharp question.

1492
00:51:06,439 --> 00:51:08,578
I passed away, right?

1493
00:51:08,579 --> 00:51:09,578
(Did I pass away?)

1494
00:51:09,579 --> 00:51:10,649
(Sighing)

1495
00:51:10,650 --> 00:51:12,449
- I don't know what to say. - It's hard to answer.

1496
00:51:12,450 --> 00:51:13,748
It's hard to answer.

1497
00:51:13,749 --> 00:51:15,149
- I don't know what to say. - It's hard to answer.

1498
00:51:15,150 --> 00:51:16,279
- It's hard to answer. - Listen.

1499
00:51:16,280 --> 00:51:18,748
If no one knows, why did I even get this person?

1500
00:51:18,749 --> 00:51:20,149
If no one knows...

1501
00:51:20,150 --> 00:51:21,788
- It's hard to say. - I can't help but be cautious.

1502
00:51:21,789 --> 00:51:26,629
Let me tell you this. My mom says you are in her heart.

1503
00:51:26,630 --> 00:51:27,899
What?

1504
00:51:27,900 --> 00:51:29,098
Let me answer.

1505
00:51:29,099 --> 00:51:31,098
(He receives a crucial hint!)

1506
00:51:31,099 --> 00:51:33,429
(Will Se Chan be able to get it right?)

1507
00:51:33,430 --> 00:51:34,574
A deity.

1508
00:51:35,369 --> 00:51:36,545
No?

1509
00:51:36,840 --> 00:51:38,168
(Se Chan is close to the answer.)

1510
00:51:38,169 --> 00:51:39,638
You are going in the right direction.

1511
00:51:39,639 --> 00:51:41,255
That's good.

1512
00:51:43,139 --> 00:51:44,949
(Hitting)

1513
00:51:44,950 --> 00:51:46,379
You hit hard.

1514
00:51:46,380 --> 00:51:47,779
All right. All right.

1515
00:51:47,780 --> 00:51:49,219
Give me one of my important works.

1516
00:51:49,220 --> 00:51:50,688
(Give me one of my important works.)

1517
00:51:50,689 --> 00:51:51,748
Okay.

1518
00:51:51,749 --> 00:51:53,118
(Hyun Hee asked a sharp question.)

1519
00:51:53,119 --> 00:51:54,435
One of your important works?

1520
00:51:54,590 --> 00:51:55,788
Yes.

1521
00:51:55,789 --> 00:51:57,665
- That person has... - Where does my face appear?

1522
00:51:58,189 --> 00:51:59,659
music videos.

1523
00:51:59,660 --> 00:52:00,899
(That person has music videos.)

1524
00:52:00,900 --> 00:52:02,558
- Music videos? - What?

1525
00:52:02,559 --> 00:52:04,168
(Se Chan unintentionally gave a crucial hint.)

1526
00:52:04,169 --> 00:52:06,674
What was it called?

1527
00:52:07,070 --> 00:52:08,868
The foreign award ceremony.

1528
00:52:08,869 --> 00:52:10,244
Let me answer. Michael Jackson.

1529
00:52:10,970 --> 00:52:12,638
(Michael Jackson)

1530
00:52:12,639 --> 00:52:14,179
Yes!

1531
00:52:14,180 --> 00:52:15,239
How did you know?

1532
00:52:15,240 --> 00:52:17,748
(Hyun Hee of Team Blue places 1st in Round 2.)

1533
00:52:17,749 --> 00:52:20,208
- How did you know? - How did you know?

1534
00:52:20,209 --> 00:52:22,679
- You told her too many things! - I did?

1535
00:52:22,680 --> 00:52:23,924
I did?

1536
00:52:23,950 --> 00:52:25,848
How did you know?

1537
00:52:25,849 --> 00:52:27,118
How did you know?

1538
00:52:27,119 --> 00:52:29,395
- He isn't that stupid. - You're right.

1539
00:52:29,559 --> 00:52:30,558
Seriously.

1540
00:52:30,559 --> 00:52:33,529
One side of his brain is developed, but...

1541
00:52:33,530 --> 00:52:35,029
The other side collapsed.

1542
00:52:35,030 --> 00:52:37,899
(I pity him.)

1543
00:52:37,900 --> 00:52:39,244
For goodness' sake.

1544
00:52:40,030 --> 00:52:41,275
"The other side collapsed"?

1545
00:52:41,869 --> 00:52:42,938
(One side is okay.)

1546
00:52:42,939 --> 00:52:44,509
One side is okay.

1547
00:52:44,510 --> 00:52:46,339
Se Chan,

1548
00:52:46,340 --> 00:52:49,078
I will let you know that you are close.

1549
00:52:49,079 --> 00:52:51,909
Keep going in the direction of the last answer.

1550
00:52:51,910 --> 00:52:53,918
He can get it right.

1551
00:52:53,919 --> 00:52:55,118
I bet he knows the answer.

1552
00:52:55,119 --> 00:52:58,525
What kind of garments do I wear?

1553
00:52:59,389 --> 00:53:00,859
Is "Garment" the right word?

1554
00:53:00,860 --> 00:53:02,058
- "Clothing". - "Clothing".

1555
00:53:02,059 --> 00:53:03,359
"Clothing".

1556
00:53:03,360 --> 00:53:05,228
That's the collapsed side.

1557
00:53:05,229 --> 00:53:07,259
(That's the collapsed side.)

1558
00:53:07,260 --> 00:53:09,129
(He showed his collapsed side with a wrong word choice.)

1559
00:53:09,130 --> 00:53:10,998
Don't be so full of yourself.

1560
00:53:10,999 --> 00:53:12,469
- Seriously. - It's just one side.

1561
00:53:12,470 --> 00:53:13,828
- It's just one side. - For goodness' sake.

1562
00:53:13,829 --> 00:53:15,014
- I understood you. - You understood me, right?

1563
00:53:15,070 --> 00:53:17,569
- I understood you. - You did, right? Thank you.

1564
00:53:17,570 --> 00:53:18,739
Tell me.

1565
00:53:18,740 --> 00:53:21,138
Overall, you wear one color.

1566
00:53:21,139 --> 00:53:22,879
She is right.

1567
00:53:22,880 --> 00:53:24,324
He wears one color.

1568
00:53:24,380 --> 00:53:26,578
I think I know.

1569
00:53:26,579 --> 00:53:28,319
- Hurry up and say it. - Hurry up.

1570
00:53:28,320 --> 00:53:29,525
Let me answer.

1571
00:53:29,950 --> 00:53:32,518
(Who wears one color?)

1572
00:53:32,519 --> 00:53:34,859
(Will Se Chan get it right?)

1573
00:53:34,860 --> 00:53:36,034
Monk Won Hyo!

1574
00:53:36,559 --> 00:53:37,688
Monk Won Hyo! No?

1575
00:53:37,689 --> 00:53:39,259
(Monk Won Hyo!)

1576
00:53:39,260 --> 00:53:40,799
(He isn't entirely wrong, but...)

1577
00:53:40,800 --> 00:53:42,835
Thank goodness he didn't say "Wonhyo Bridge".

1578
00:53:42,959 --> 00:53:45,299
(Monk Won Hyo!)

1579
00:53:45,300 --> 00:53:47,129
I can't believe Se Chan.

1580
00:53:47,130 --> 00:53:50,239
This is like Se Chan's segment.

1581
00:53:50,240 --> 00:53:52,208
- Keep going in that direction. - Am I not Monk Won Hyo?

1582
00:53:52,209 --> 00:53:54,438
- It's okay. - This is bad.

1583
00:53:54,439 --> 00:53:55,739
This is bad.

1584
00:53:55,740 --> 00:53:58,625
- I don't know the answer. - No, no!

1585
00:53:58,780 --> 00:54:00,149
- Don't give up. - Don't be like that.

1586
00:54:00,150 --> 00:54:01,418
- Monk Won Hyo. - You...

1587
00:54:01,419 --> 00:54:03,255
- Keep going in that direction. - You...

1588
00:54:04,050 --> 00:54:06,565
Se Chan, it's time to get it right. You are nearly there.

1589
00:54:07,090 --> 00:54:09,034
If Monk Won Hyo isn't the answer,

1590
00:54:09,260 --> 00:54:11,759
I have one option left. But this is...

1591
00:54:11,760 --> 00:54:13,029
I can't wait to hear it.

1592
00:54:13,030 --> 00:54:15,098
Do you have one option left? I can't wait to hear it.

1593
00:54:15,099 --> 00:54:17,569
- Give that answer. - Go ahead.

1594
00:54:17,570 --> 00:54:20,045
- Let me answer. - Go ahead.

1595
00:54:20,099 --> 00:54:21,614
Bodydharma.

1596
00:54:24,340 --> 00:54:25,614
- Let me answer. - Go ahead.

1597
00:54:25,769 --> 00:54:27,708
(He said "Bodydharma", not "Bodhidharma".)

1598
00:54:27,709 --> 00:54:29,509
(Bodydharma!)

1599
00:54:29,510 --> 00:54:31,449
It's "Bodhidharma"!

1600
00:54:31,450 --> 00:54:32,708
(He showed his flaws through a series of lousy answers.)

1601
00:54:32,709 --> 00:54:34,179
- It's "Bodhidharma"! - Bodhidharma.

1602
00:54:34,180 --> 00:54:35,848
Bodhidharma.

1603
00:54:35,849 --> 00:54:37,018
Bodhidharma.

1604
00:54:37,019 --> 00:54:38,324
Is it incorrect?

1605
00:54:38,550 --> 00:54:39,748
"Bodydharma".

1606
00:54:39,749 --> 00:54:41,494
- Come on, Se Chan. - Bodhidharma.

1607
00:54:42,160 --> 00:54:43,594
- Go ahead. - Come on, Se Chan.

1608
00:54:44,329 --> 00:54:46,205
Is it incorrect? What's the answer?

1609
00:54:47,160 --> 00:54:49,458
Which age group am I in?

1610
00:54:49,459 --> 00:54:51,299
- Hold on. - My age.

1611
00:54:51,300 --> 00:54:53,268
You are in your 40s.

1612
00:54:53,269 --> 00:54:54,339
- What? - What?

1613
00:54:54,340 --> 00:54:55,399
- What? - Is that right?

1614
00:54:55,400 --> 00:54:57,668
You can get scolded later.

1615
00:54:57,669 --> 00:54:58,668
(You can get scolded later.)

1616
00:54:58,669 --> 00:55:00,109
(Se Chan, I am not in my 40s.)

1617
00:55:00,110 --> 00:55:01,985
- Hold on. - It's okay.

1618
00:55:02,079 --> 00:55:04,379
- It's okay. - Oh, you are in your late 30s.

1619
00:55:04,380 --> 00:55:05,784
Big Sister, I am sorry.

1620
00:55:05,809 --> 00:55:07,424
I thought she was in her 40s.

1621
00:55:07,849 --> 00:55:09,279
- Hey. - What are you doing?

1622
00:55:09,280 --> 00:55:10,888
- What are you doing? - Is she in her late 30s?

1623
00:55:10,889 --> 00:55:12,319
- "Big Sister"? - I thought she was in her 40s.

1624
00:55:12,320 --> 00:55:13,719
- "Big Sister"? - Make sure...

1625
00:55:13,720 --> 00:55:15,918
you apologize to her later.

1626
00:55:15,919 --> 00:55:17,558
- My goodness. - It was a crucial hint.

1627
00:55:17,559 --> 00:55:18,788
(Se Chan revealed a crucial hint!)

1628
00:55:18,789 --> 00:55:20,899
Se Chan, you are close.

1629
00:55:20,900 --> 00:55:22,534
Make a U-turn.

1630
00:55:22,729 --> 00:55:25,899
When I said "deity" earlier,

1631
00:55:25,900 --> 00:55:28,514
- people reacted. - That's right.

1632
00:55:28,599 --> 00:55:29,969
Then I should go in that direction.

1633
00:55:29,970 --> 00:55:31,138
That's right!

1634
00:55:31,139 --> 00:55:32,485
(That's right!)

1635
00:55:32,740 --> 00:55:34,339
I like the cross, right?

1636
00:55:34,340 --> 00:55:35,909
(I like the cross, right?)

1637
00:55:35,910 --> 00:55:37,808
(Don't say something so controversial.)

1638
00:55:37,809 --> 00:55:39,424
Are you talking to yourself? Is that a question?

1639
00:55:39,510 --> 00:55:41,679
He is talking to himself. Say so, you jerk!

1640
00:55:41,680 --> 00:55:43,649
(Say so, you jerk!)

1641
00:55:43,650 --> 00:55:46,149
I am frustrated too, you jerk!

1642
00:55:46,150 --> 00:55:47,458
(I am frustrated too, you jerk!)

1643
00:55:47,459 --> 00:55:48,735
(He clenches his fists.)

1644
00:55:49,019 --> 00:55:51,129
Who am I? I am dying over here.

1645
00:55:51,130 --> 00:55:53,029
Stop attacking me when you are on my team.

1646
00:55:53,030 --> 00:55:56,129
(Se Chan's anger makes everyone else laugh.)

1647
00:55:56,130 --> 00:55:57,529
(Laughing)

1648
00:55:57,530 --> 00:56:00,098
They said one side of my brain collapsed.

1649
00:56:00,099 --> 00:56:01,868
They said one side of my brain collapsed.

1650
00:56:01,869 --> 00:56:04,045
(The older members collapse because of Se Chan.)

1651
00:56:04,740 --> 00:56:08,038
(The collapsed side is making this round interesting.)

1652
00:56:08,039 --> 00:56:09,554
You have nothing to do with the cross.

1653
00:56:09,709 --> 00:56:11,649
Really? Okay.

1654
00:56:11,650 --> 00:56:12,679
You can do this.

1655
00:56:12,680 --> 00:56:15,719
- It must be a hard one. - No, it isn't. You can do this.

1656
00:56:15,720 --> 00:56:18,348
Do I have a signature pose?

1657
00:56:18,349 --> 00:56:19,719
That wasn't a bad question.

1658
00:56:19,720 --> 00:56:20,895
- That was pretty sharp. - A pose.

1659
00:56:21,260 --> 00:56:22,835
- Crossed legs. - Crossed legs?

1660
00:56:23,019 --> 00:56:24,335
Let me answer. Crossed legs?

1661
00:56:24,490 --> 00:56:25,688
Let me answer.

1662
00:56:25,689 --> 00:56:27,129
(He finally gets an idea!)

1663
00:56:27,130 --> 00:56:29,859
(An influencer who wears one color and sits cross-legged)

1664
00:56:29,860 --> 00:56:31,005
Gandhi.

1665
00:56:31,669 --> 00:56:32,728
Is it incorrect?

1666
00:56:32,729 --> 00:56:34,998
(Gandhi)

1667
00:56:34,999 --> 00:56:37,609
(Gandhi is an influencer who sits cross-legged)

1668
00:56:37,610 --> 00:56:39,214
Is Gandhi incorrect?

1669
00:56:39,269 --> 00:56:41,355
I don't know what to do.

1670
00:56:41,479 --> 00:56:43,185
Is Gandhi incorrect?

1671
00:56:43,709 --> 00:56:45,149
All the answers are similar.

1672
00:56:45,150 --> 00:56:46,179
(All the answers are strangely similar.)

1673
00:56:46,180 --> 00:56:47,549
All the answers are similar.

1674
00:56:47,550 --> 00:56:49,179
Both of you failed. The answers are...

1675
00:56:49,180 --> 00:56:50,279
(Both Se Chan and Ji Hyun failed to win a point.)

1676
00:56:50,280 --> 00:56:51,895
Gautama Buddha and Gummy.

1677
00:56:51,950 --> 00:56:53,748
- Who? - Gautama Buddha.

1678
00:56:53,749 --> 00:56:55,994
Do you know the word?

1679
00:56:56,289 --> 00:56:57,629
I have heard it before.

1680
00:56:57,630 --> 00:57:00,089
(I have heard it before.)

1681
00:57:00,090 --> 00:57:01,629
(Gautama Buddha is an advanced word he has heard before.)

1682
00:57:01,630 --> 00:57:03,159
You have heard it before.

1683
00:57:03,160 --> 00:57:05,029
That's too bad. We could have done better.

1684
00:57:05,030 --> 00:57:06,299
You were close.

1685
00:57:06,300 --> 00:57:08,768
Thus, the four members of Team Blue will eat.

1686
00:57:08,769 --> 00:57:10,339
(The 4 members of Team Blue win the right to eat.)

1687
00:57:10,340 --> 00:57:13,609
(Jae Seok, Seok Jin, Kwang Soo, and Hyun Hee can eat.)

1688
00:57:13,610 --> 00:57:15,638
Does anyone want to use the chance?

1689
00:57:15,639 --> 00:57:16,915
I will use it.

1690
00:57:16,939 --> 00:57:19,348
Now, I will tell you if there are greedy pigs in the group.

1691
00:57:19,349 --> 00:57:20,649
- Okay. - Tell us.

1692
00:57:20,650 --> 00:57:22,018
I bet Kwang Soo is a greedy pig.

1693
00:57:22,019 --> 00:57:23,918
- I am not a greedy pig. - I bet Kwang Soo is a greedy pig.

1694
00:57:23,919 --> 00:57:26,949
The number will either be 2 or 1.

1695
00:57:26,950 --> 00:57:30,319
The number of greedy pigs in the group is...

1696
00:57:30,320 --> 00:57:34,275
(How many greedy pigs are in the group?)

1697
00:57:34,829 --> 00:57:35,998
one.

1698
00:57:35,999 --> 00:57:39,268
(It's one.)

1699
00:57:39,269 --> 00:57:41,415
- Watch them. Someone will act. - Jae Seok.

1700
00:57:41,939 --> 00:57:43,569
- I am not it. - I am not it.

1701
00:57:43,570 --> 00:57:45,609
- You keep saying that. - It could be Hyun Hee.

1702
00:57:45,610 --> 00:57:46,808
It could be Kwang Soo.

1703
00:57:46,809 --> 00:57:48,239
- I am telling the truth. - You aren't it, are you?

1704
00:57:48,240 --> 00:57:49,638
- You aren't it, are you? - No.

1705
00:57:49,639 --> 00:57:50,978
Haha isn't a greedy pig.

1706
00:57:50,979 --> 00:57:52,109
- I am not it. - It's one of the two.

1707
00:57:52,110 --> 00:57:54,679
There is one greedy pig among them.

1708
00:57:54,680 --> 00:57:56,355
- I am really not it. - Ji Hyo.

1709
00:57:56,450 --> 00:57:58,025
It's definitely her.

1710
00:57:58,349 --> 00:58:00,018
Kwang Soo's ears are red.

1711
00:58:00,019 --> 00:58:02,235
- He said he won't eat. - I'm really not it.

1712
00:58:02,490 --> 00:58:04,364
I'm quite full.

1713
00:58:04,559 --> 00:58:06,328
- It was a good meal. - It was very delicious.

1714
00:58:06,329 --> 00:58:08,634
- Yes. - It looked really delicious.

1715
00:58:08,959 --> 00:58:10,029
It looked so delicious.

1716
00:58:10,030 --> 00:58:12,475
<i>- Come on, come on - Come on, come on</i>

1717
00:58:13,329 --> 00:58:15,839
Wait, who else is it other than Jong Kook and Ji Hyo?

1718
00:58:15,840 --> 00:58:18,409
Jong Kook, Ji Hyo, and So Min.

1719
00:58:18,410 --> 00:58:20,268
- It's 1 of them right? - It's 1 of them.

1720
00:58:20,269 --> 00:58:22,478
- Next are me, Kwang Soo, Jae Seok. - And Kwang Soo.

1721
00:58:22,479 --> 00:58:23,609
- He's a greedy pig. - Hyun Hee.

1722
00:58:23,610 --> 00:58:25,308
- It was a great meal. - Hyun Hee. It's one of us.

1723
00:58:25,309 --> 00:58:27,748
We should exclude those with a chance card.

1724
00:58:27,749 --> 00:58:29,219
We should exclude them.

1725
00:58:29,220 --> 00:58:31,418
Right, those who have a chance card aren't it.

1726
00:58:31,419 --> 00:58:32,918
I'll eat again at our next destination.

1727
00:58:32,919 --> 00:58:35,034
- Jae Seok, do you have one? - Yes, I do.

1728
00:58:35,590 --> 00:58:37,859
Hyun Hee, do you have a chance card?

1729
00:58:37,860 --> 00:58:39,089
- I do. - Does Jae Seok have one too?

1730
00:58:39,090 --> 00:58:42,228
- Yes. - It's either me or Kwang Soo.

1731
00:58:42,229 --> 00:58:43,958
- Right. - It's either me or Kwang Soo.

1732
00:58:43,959 --> 00:58:45,498
- It's not me, so it's him. - It must be Kwang Soo.

1733
00:58:45,499 --> 00:58:47,074
Isn't it both of you?

1734
00:58:48,200 --> 00:58:50,098
What's your hobby, Ji Hyun?

1735
00:58:50,099 --> 00:58:52,168
Me? It's fishing.

1736
00:58:52,169 --> 00:58:54,009
- Fishing? That's unexpected. - Fishing?

1737
00:58:54,010 --> 00:58:55,985
- Do you fish in the sea? - Yes.

1738
00:58:56,410 --> 00:58:58,449
- Do you follow your boyfriend? - I know.

1739
00:58:58,450 --> 00:59:01,324
- It seems like it. - I'm certain of it.

1740
00:59:01,650 --> 00:59:02,819
Have you been together for two years?

1741
00:59:02,820 --> 00:59:03,848
How did you know?

1742
00:59:03,849 --> 00:59:07,025
(How does she know that?)

1743
00:59:08,689 --> 00:59:09,819
- No. - She's so innocent.

1744
00:59:09,820 --> 00:59:11,828
- She knew for certain. - No.

1745
00:59:11,829 --> 00:59:14,188
- How does So Min know? - How do you know for sure?

1746
00:59:14,189 --> 00:59:16,429
- I can tell you that... - She's so innocent.

1747
00:59:16,430 --> 00:59:19,668
So Min knows a lot about dating.

1748
00:59:19,669 --> 00:59:21,038
When it comes to dating...

1749
00:59:21,039 --> 00:59:22,498
She knows a lot about love.

1750
00:59:22,499 --> 00:59:24,538
Regarding love, go and see So Min.

1751
00:59:24,539 --> 00:59:27,268
I hope that So Min gets a segment.

1752
00:59:27,269 --> 00:59:30,208
I got a lot of advice on dating.

1753
00:59:30,209 --> 00:59:31,848
- She's different. - Why did you get advice on dating?

1754
00:59:31,849 --> 00:59:33,649
- Stopping getting dating advice. - Hey!

1755
00:59:33,650 --> 00:59:34,918
(Who's giving who advice?)

1756
00:59:34,919 --> 00:59:36,018
- Kwang Soo. - You're with someone.

1757
00:59:36,019 --> 00:59:37,379
I'm her VIP client.

1758
00:59:37,380 --> 00:59:38,918
You have no experience in dating.

1759
00:59:38,919 --> 00:59:40,418
Seok Jin, you got married thanks to whom?

1760
00:59:40,419 --> 00:59:41,958
- That's right. - Thanks to you.

1761
00:59:41,959 --> 00:59:43,018
That's right.

1762
00:59:43,019 --> 00:59:44,859
Eating sausage stew was a mistake on the first date.

1763
00:59:44,860 --> 00:59:45,859
Why?

1764
00:59:45,860 --> 00:59:48,399
Your date doesn't like you if you eat sausage stew, right?

1765
00:59:48,400 --> 00:59:51,029
I had sausage stew once on my first date.

1766
00:59:51,030 --> 00:59:53,074
- Really? - That day,

1767
00:59:53,200 --> 00:59:56,239
I wanted to break ramyeon noodles, so I did.

1768
00:59:56,240 --> 00:59:58,668
- I still remember what he told me. - What?

1769
00:59:58,669 --> 01:00:00,668
He said that the ramyeon noodles that I broke looked pretty.

1770
01:00:00,669 --> 01:00:03,478
I always break ramyeon noodles ever since then.

1771
01:00:03,479 --> 01:00:04,884
I always break them.

1772
01:00:05,010 --> 01:00:06,308
She knows a lot about love.

1773
01:00:06,309 --> 01:00:07,308
Forget it.

1774
01:00:07,309 --> 01:00:10,679
Ji Hyun, is there something that your boyfriend said...

1775
01:00:10,680 --> 01:00:12,219
that's unforgettable?

1776
01:00:12,220 --> 01:00:14,719
- What made your heart flutter? - Or something that offended you.

1777
01:00:14,720 --> 01:00:15,835
An action.

1778
01:00:16,559 --> 01:00:19,659
We were watching a movie at a movie theater.

1779
01:00:19,660 --> 01:00:21,828
- We looked at each other. - You looked at each other.

1780
01:00:21,829 --> 01:00:23,935
He said that my eyes were like stars.

1781
01:00:24,030 --> 01:00:25,228
Goodness.

1782
01:00:25,229 --> 01:00:27,868
- Goodness. - I heard of it.

1783
01:00:27,869 --> 01:00:29,244
What are you talking about?

1784
01:00:29,300 --> 01:00:31,109
- "I go double" - I'm not finished talking.

1785
01:00:31,110 --> 01:00:32,344
I'll double it.

1786
01:00:33,010 --> 01:00:34,614
When we were watching a movie,

1787
01:00:34,840 --> 01:00:37,609
my boyfriend looked only at me for two hours.

1788
01:00:37,610 --> 01:00:38,609
(He only looked at So Min.)

1789
01:00:38,610 --> 01:00:40,848
He turned his head and looked at me because I was pretty.

1790
01:00:40,849 --> 01:00:43,018
- Isn't that scary? - It's scary.

1791
01:00:43,019 --> 01:00:44,688
- No. - It's scary.

1792
01:00:44,689 --> 01:00:46,748
- It's very scary. - He liked me so much.

1793
01:00:46,749 --> 01:00:48,388
Do you remember something, Ji Hyo?

1794
01:00:48,389 --> 01:00:50,618
You remember something, don't you? Tell us.

1795
01:00:50,619 --> 01:00:52,529
I heard what So Min said.

1796
01:00:52,530 --> 01:00:56,098
When I was watching movies with my boyfriend,

1797
01:00:56,099 --> 01:00:59,868
he kept touching my hand...

1798
01:00:59,869 --> 01:01:01,944
and kept looking at me.

1799
01:01:02,240 --> 01:01:04,339
I asked him if he's not watching the movie.

1800
01:01:04,340 --> 01:01:06,444
He said that he wanted to keep looking at me.

1801
01:01:07,010 --> 01:01:08,478
He wanted to keep looking at me.

1802
01:01:08,479 --> 01:01:09,478
(She's so affectionate.)

1803
01:01:09,479 --> 01:01:11,884
- I slapped him to wake him up. - Did you slap him?

1804
01:01:12,110 --> 01:01:13,708
- She slapped him. - Did you slap him?

1805
01:01:13,709 --> 01:01:15,379
- Come to your senses. - "Come to your senses"?

1806
01:01:15,380 --> 01:01:16,918
- It's because she was embarrassed. - Isn't it like this?

1807
01:01:16,919 --> 01:01:18,518
I also said something similar.

1808
01:01:18,519 --> 01:01:20,188
She asked me what I wanted to watch.

1809
01:01:20,189 --> 01:01:22,764
I said, "Watch anything. I'm going to look at you."

1810
01:01:24,320 --> 01:01:26,529
(He goes after what women love.)

1811
01:01:26,530 --> 01:01:28,859
That's not all. Sometimes I take photos of something,

1812
01:01:28,860 --> 01:01:31,569
and then I start taking pictures of my girlfriend.

1813
01:01:31,570 --> 01:01:32,668
When she tells me to stop, I say,

1814
01:01:32,669 --> 01:01:35,574
"I usually take pictures of pretty things."

1815
01:01:35,639 --> 01:01:37,868
(I usually take pictures of pretty things.)

1816
01:01:37,869 --> 01:01:39,739
What's that? Goodness.

1817
01:01:39,740 --> 01:01:41,839
- Come on. - That's too much.

1818
01:01:41,840 --> 01:01:43,279
- Goodness. - Don't you do it?

1819
01:01:43,280 --> 01:01:46,009
- That's annoying. - Don't you do it?

1820
01:01:46,010 --> 01:01:48,819
He's a machine that makes people's hearts flutter.

1821
01:01:48,820 --> 01:01:51,319
This is how it goes. Say, "Don't take my picture."

1822
01:01:51,320 --> 01:01:53,025
Don't take my picture, Haha.

1823
01:01:53,619 --> 01:01:55,589
"I usually take pictures of pretty things."

1824
01:01:55,590 --> 01:01:56,859
No.

1825
01:01:56,860 --> 01:01:59,489
(It's the same line.)

1826
01:01:59,490 --> 01:02:01,429
- That's not how you do it. - Haha.

1827
01:02:01,430 --> 01:02:03,029
- Haha, that's... - That's strange.

1828
01:02:03,030 --> 01:02:04,699
- That's not it. - That's the wrong tone.

1829
01:02:04,700 --> 01:02:05,768
That's not how it sounds.

1830
01:02:05,769 --> 01:02:07,699
- Say, "Don't take my picture." - That's not it.

1831
01:02:07,700 --> 01:02:10,438
Why do you keep taking photos of me? Stop it.

1832
01:02:10,439 --> 01:02:11,944
I took a photo of myself.

1833
01:02:13,209 --> 01:02:14,509
- It was a selfie. - It was a selfie.

1834
01:02:14,510 --> 01:02:16,255
- I like this too. - That was funny.

1835
01:02:16,439 --> 01:02:18,449
- What are you taking photos of? - Your earwax.

1836
01:02:18,450 --> 01:02:21,379
- Why are you taking a photo of it? - I take photos of intriguing stuff.

1837
01:02:21,380 --> 01:02:23,918
(I have to take photos when it's intriguing.)

1838
01:02:23,919 --> 01:02:25,848
- It's your earwax. - It's very intriguing.

1839
01:02:25,849 --> 01:02:28,659
I can't stay still when I see intriguing things.

1840
01:02:28,660 --> 01:02:29,958
Why is my ear intriguing?

1841
01:02:29,959 --> 01:02:31,859
- That's funny. - Hey.

1842
01:02:31,860 --> 01:02:33,534
(While they finish imitating Jong Kook...)

1843
01:02:33,860 --> 01:02:35,029
Where are we?

1844
01:02:35,030 --> 01:02:36,304
It's a Chinese restaurant.

1845
01:02:36,729 --> 01:02:39,045
(Last dish that awaits the members)

1846
01:02:40,769 --> 01:02:43,239
It's crab meat. It's a gourmet dish.

1847
01:02:43,240 --> 01:02:45,085
Gosh, it's tangsuyuk.

1848
01:02:45,740 --> 01:02:46,985
It's mala sauce.

1849
01:02:47,070 --> 01:02:49,279
- I really want to eat it. - It's unbelievable.

1850
01:02:49,280 --> 01:02:51,284
It's braised seafood and vegetables.

1851
01:02:51,309 --> 01:02:52,379
Braised seafood and vegetables?

1852
01:02:52,380 --> 01:02:54,109
- Braised seafood and vegetables. - It's sold a lot these days.

1853
01:02:54,110 --> 01:02:55,118
Braised seafood and vegetables.

1854
01:02:55,119 --> 01:02:58,018
So Min, Ji Hyo, and Jong Kook haven't eaten yet.

1855
01:02:58,019 --> 01:03:00,565
- Right. - One of them is a greedy pig.

1856
01:03:00,590 --> 01:03:03,319
It's your last chance to catch the greedy pigs.

1857
01:03:03,320 --> 01:03:05,228
- Have a seat, everyone. - Okay.

1858
01:03:05,229 --> 01:03:06,288
(Will they find the greedy pigs?)

1859
01:03:06,289 --> 01:03:08,505
- Shall we start? - Let's go.

1860
01:03:08,660 --> 01:03:10,228
- Let's do it. - Now...

1861
01:03:10,229 --> 01:03:12,844
- Start. - let's enjoy yourselves.

1862
01:03:13,030 --> 01:03:14,775
- 1. - 3.

1863
01:03:14,939 --> 01:03:16,714
- 2. - 3.

1864
01:03:16,939 --> 01:03:18,609
- 2. - 3.

1865
01:03:18,610 --> 01:03:19,609
- 3. - 4.

1866
01:03:19,610 --> 01:03:20,909
- 2, 3. - 5.

1867
01:03:20,910 --> 01:03:22,208
- 2. - 6.

1868
01:03:22,209 --> 01:03:23,654
(Kwang Soo and Hyun Hee say 6 at the same time.)

1869
01:03:24,579 --> 01:03:26,078
(They got caught at 6.)

1870
01:03:26,079 --> 01:03:27,918
We went far.

1871
01:03:27,919 --> 01:03:29,478
- Kwang Soo. - We got to six.

1872
01:03:29,479 --> 01:03:31,319
- It's six. - That was amazing.

1873
01:03:31,320 --> 01:03:32,918
- We went far. - Here's a card for six.

1874
01:03:32,919 --> 01:03:34,719
- Gosh. - This is good.

1875
01:03:34,720 --> 01:03:36,219
- It's great. - Get ready,

1876
01:03:36,220 --> 01:03:37,719
set, go, three.

1877
01:03:37,720 --> 01:03:38,929
- 1. - 2.

1878
01:03:38,930 --> 01:03:40,688
3, 2, 1.

1879
01:03:40,689 --> 01:03:41,699
Three.

1880
01:03:41,700 --> 01:03:43,399
(Kwang Soo and Seok Jin say 3 at the same time.)

1881
01:03:43,400 --> 01:03:45,129
Three people.

1882
01:03:45,130 --> 01:03:46,668
(Kwang Soo gets caught on Round 2 as well.)

1883
01:03:46,669 --> 01:03:48,645
- Gosh. - Why?

1884
01:03:49,369 --> 01:03:51,145
Here's the last round.

1885
01:03:51,209 --> 01:03:53,868
Get ready, set, go.

1886
01:03:53,869 --> 01:03:54,938
- 1. - 1.

1887
01:03:54,939 --> 01:03:57,085
(Haha and So Min say 1 at the same time.)

1888
01:03:57,849 --> 01:03:59,909
(Why did So Min say 1?)

1889
01:03:59,910 --> 01:04:01,649
- Who said one? - Haha.

1890
01:04:01,650 --> 01:04:03,118
- So Min. - Why did you say it?

1891
01:04:03,119 --> 01:04:04,279
So Min is very suspicious.

1892
01:04:04,280 --> 01:04:05,918
- I thought... - She's very suspicious.

1893
01:04:05,919 --> 01:04:08,188
That's not it, Ji Hyo.

1894
01:04:08,189 --> 01:04:10,558
I always said one whenever we played Race of Wits.

1895
01:04:10,559 --> 01:04:12,188
- I always said 1 or 2. - So Min.

1896
01:04:12,189 --> 01:04:14,228
It's obvious that I'm the one who says it.

1897
01:04:14,229 --> 01:04:17,659
You never said one at all today.

1898
01:04:17,660 --> 01:04:20,228
The result is quite extreme. It's 1, 3, and 6.

1899
01:04:20,229 --> 01:04:22,339
- That's true. - Who will pick?

1900
01:04:22,340 --> 01:04:23,844
I'll pick.

1901
01:04:24,300 --> 01:04:26,214
Come back.

1902
01:04:26,470 --> 01:04:27,784
(Booing)

1903
01:04:28,539 --> 01:04:30,009
(The majority is against it.)

1904
01:04:30,010 --> 01:04:31,525
(He comes back.)

1905
01:04:31,550 --> 01:04:32,549
(He acted cute, so they let him pick.)

1906
01:04:32,550 --> 01:04:35,179
- That's funny. - I'll pick.

1907
01:04:35,180 --> 01:04:36,694
How many do you want?

1908
01:04:36,820 --> 01:04:38,319
- We want 6. - Pick 6.

1909
01:04:38,320 --> 01:04:39,589
- Six? - Doesn't he know?

1910
01:04:39,590 --> 01:04:40,589
Pick six.

1911
01:04:40,590 --> 01:04:43,364
- Here I go. - Make it clean this time.

1912
01:04:44,559 --> 01:04:45,558
It's six.

1913
01:04:45,559 --> 01:04:46,665
(He picks without hesitating.)

1914
01:04:49,360 --> 01:04:50,929
- Show us first. - Please.

1915
01:04:50,930 --> 01:04:53,569
(Will it be a card of 6 that the members wanted?)

1916
01:04:53,570 --> 01:04:54,674
(Disappointed)

1917
01:04:56,139 --> 01:04:57,815
One person.

1918
01:05:00,169 --> 01:05:02,214
- Isn't this... - What's wrong with this?

1919
01:05:02,510 --> 01:05:03,679
What's wrong with this?

1920
01:05:03,680 --> 01:05:05,078
Was I supposed to pick it?

1921
01:05:05,079 --> 01:05:06,909
- This is difficult. - We're in trouble.

1922
01:05:06,910 --> 01:05:09,949
Here's the mission to have one member eat.

1923
01:05:09,950 --> 01:05:12,094
It's Catching Water While Lying Down.

1924
01:05:12,320 --> 01:05:15,719
Five members will lie down in opposite directions.

1925
01:05:15,720 --> 01:05:18,859
Pass a tray filled with water to the next person without rising.

1926
01:05:18,860 --> 01:05:21,935
The team with the most water after three minutes wins.

1927
01:05:21,959 --> 01:05:24,744
The winning team can choose one member to eat.

1928
01:05:25,200 --> 01:05:27,668
Let's select the teams carefully.

1929
01:05:27,669 --> 01:05:29,239
- Right. - Right?

1930
01:05:29,240 --> 01:05:31,514
In the count of three,

1931
01:05:31,539 --> 01:05:33,069
show what you have. 1, 2, 3.

1932
01:05:33,070 --> 01:05:34,509
- Red. - Blue.

1933
01:05:34,510 --> 01:05:36,078
Yes, I'm not on Kwang Soo's team.

1934
01:05:36,079 --> 01:05:37,808
- Kwang Soo. - I'm not it.

1935
01:05:37,809 --> 01:05:39,909
He's a strong candidate.

1936
01:05:39,910 --> 01:05:41,449
- Let's make him do that. - He should play first.

1937
01:05:41,450 --> 01:05:43,719
- Right, he should play first. - If it reaches all the way here...

1938
01:05:43,720 --> 01:05:44,949
You can't make mistakes here.

1939
01:05:44,950 --> 01:05:47,364
- So... - Let's see how well you pass.

1940
01:05:48,059 --> 01:05:49,219
It's a lonely fight.

1941
01:05:49,220 --> 01:05:51,804
You should be the last, Haha. Do you want to pour it?

1942
01:05:52,030 --> 01:05:53,089
Okay.

1943
01:05:53,090 --> 01:05:54,089
(Haha is the last player.)

1944
01:05:54,090 --> 01:05:55,958
Put your shoulders together.

1945
01:05:55,959 --> 01:05:57,129
- Shoulders? - Shoulders.

1946
01:05:57,130 --> 01:05:59,199
Get ready, set...

1947
01:05:59,200 --> 01:06:00,304
(Get ready.)

1948
01:06:00,470 --> 01:06:02,415
It'll be obvious based on how he plays.

1949
01:06:02,639 --> 01:06:04,498
- Gosh. - It looks heavy.

1950
01:06:04,499 --> 01:06:07,609
(The tray is filled with water.)

1951
01:06:07,610 --> 01:06:09,255
It's not easy.

1952
01:06:09,510 --> 01:06:10,654
It's not easy.

1953
01:06:11,010 --> 01:06:12,379
Hold it.

1954
01:06:12,380 --> 01:06:13,455
(Pouring)

1955
01:06:14,349 --> 01:06:16,819
Hold it. I swear that I'm not it.

1956
01:06:16,820 --> 01:06:19,264
- Look at him. - How is he not it?

1957
01:06:19,320 --> 01:06:20,319
It's not easy.

1958
01:06:20,320 --> 01:06:21,958
- He can't do it. - It's not easy.

1959
01:06:21,959 --> 01:06:24,489
- He's getting angry. - Seok Jin.

1960
01:06:24,490 --> 01:06:26,129
You shouldn't grab it like that.

1961
01:06:26,130 --> 01:06:27,304
(You shouldn't grab it like that.)

1962
01:06:27,930 --> 01:06:30,929
(Seok Jin slightly grabs the edge.)

1963
01:06:30,930 --> 01:06:32,529
Seok Jin is being suspicious.

1964
01:06:32,530 --> 01:06:33,768
Seok Jin is suspicious.

1965
01:06:33,769 --> 01:06:36,538
Grab both sides. Why are you holding one side?

1966
01:06:36,539 --> 01:06:38,569
Right, you have to grab both sides.

1967
01:06:38,570 --> 01:06:39,708
Grab both sides.

1968
01:06:39,709 --> 01:06:41,638
That's how it was sent.

1969
01:06:41,639 --> 01:06:43,284
Seok Jin is suspicious.

1970
01:06:43,309 --> 01:06:45,554
(Spilling)

1971
01:06:46,010 --> 01:06:47,625
Hurry up.

1972
01:06:48,150 --> 01:06:49,319
- One minute has passed. - It's cold.

1973
01:06:49,320 --> 01:06:51,225
Seok Jin is terrible.

1974
01:06:52,550 --> 01:06:53,895
How should I grab it?

1975
01:06:54,220 --> 01:06:56,489
- Hey, hey! - Come on.

1976
01:06:56,490 --> 01:06:58,458
- Hey, let it go. - Seok Jin.

1977
01:06:58,459 --> 01:07:00,228
Your grip isn't straight.

1978
01:07:00,229 --> 01:07:02,529
- What do you mean? - It isn't straight.

1979
01:07:02,530 --> 01:07:04,228
- See? It's not straight. - It's not straight.

1980
01:07:04,229 --> 01:07:05,929
You shouldn't grab it like that.

1981
01:07:05,930 --> 01:07:07,174
It's cold.

1982
01:07:07,329 --> 01:07:08,674
Two minutes have passed.

1983
01:07:09,139 --> 01:07:10,239
It's so cold.

1984
01:07:10,240 --> 01:07:11,668
We have to go faster now.

1985
01:07:11,669 --> 01:07:13,109
Okay, take it now.

1986
01:07:13,110 --> 01:07:14,185
(Seok Jin is so terrible.)

1987
01:07:14,809 --> 01:07:16,308
- That's right. - Both sides.

1988
01:07:16,309 --> 01:07:17,839
- Seok Jin. - Let it go.

1989
01:07:17,840 --> 01:07:19,609
You're not straight.

1990
01:07:19,610 --> 01:07:20,609
(He explodes.)

1991
01:07:20,610 --> 01:07:22,748
- Let it go, Ji Hyo. - You're not straight.

1992
01:07:22,749 --> 01:07:24,748
- Seok Jin isn't straight. - Let it go.

1993
01:07:24,749 --> 01:07:26,819
Hey, Ji Hyo is being suspicious.

1994
01:07:26,820 --> 01:07:28,788
- Right? - Your grip isn't straight.

1995
01:07:28,789 --> 01:07:29,895
(Spilling)

1996
01:07:31,289 --> 01:07:33,089
Seok Jin didn't grab it straight.

1997
01:07:33,090 --> 01:07:34,759
He spilled all of it.

1998
01:07:34,760 --> 01:07:37,429
No, Seok Jin isn't suspicious. He just can't do it.

1999
01:07:37,430 --> 01:07:39,228
- That's it. - Try it and see if you can do it.

2000
01:07:39,229 --> 01:07:41,938
- He can't do it. - Seok Jin is terrible.

2001
01:07:41,939 --> 01:07:43,938
Ji Hyo is being suspicious.

2002
01:07:43,939 --> 01:07:46,638
- You didn't grab it straight. - You're being strange.

2003
01:07:46,639 --> 01:07:48,955
- She can just let it go. - She won't let it go.

2004
01:07:49,010 --> 01:07:51,114
- Ji Hyo holds it. - Fine, I'll let it go.

2005
01:07:52,579 --> 01:07:54,025
Look at that.

2006
01:07:54,550 --> 01:07:55,679
(As you said, I'll let it go.)

2007
01:07:55,680 --> 01:07:57,018
Look at this! For goodness' sake!

2008
01:07:57,019 --> 01:07:58,565
(For goodness' sake!)

2009
01:07:59,220 --> 01:08:01,094
What was that? He went, "For goodness' sake!"

2010
01:08:01,189 --> 01:08:02,319
It's game over!

2011
01:08:02,320 --> 01:08:03,594
"For goodness' sake"?

2012
01:08:03,660 --> 01:08:05,505
(He is childish.)

2013
01:08:06,059 --> 01:08:08,259
(Seok Jin lost his temper.)

2014
01:08:08,260 --> 01:08:09,804
- There is no water. - You spilled it on purpose.

2015
01:08:10,459 --> 01:08:12,399
(3 minutes end!)

2016
01:08:12,400 --> 01:08:14,029
Why did you spill it on purpose?

2017
01:08:14,030 --> 01:08:16,844
- You have the worst teamwork. - Seok Jin, look.

2018
01:08:16,970 --> 01:08:19,239
- You are really suspicious. - Seok Jin, look.

2019
01:08:19,240 --> 01:08:21,409
- I... - You should have let it go.

2020
01:08:21,410 --> 01:08:23,839
- You would have spilled it all. - I was holding the tray.

2021
01:08:23,840 --> 01:08:25,355
I told her to let go,

2022
01:08:25,610 --> 01:08:27,348
but she held on to it.

2023
01:08:27,349 --> 01:08:28,718
Since you were holding only one side,

2024
01:08:28,719 --> 01:08:30,754
- I had to hold the other side. - She pulled it towards her.

2025
01:08:31,120 --> 01:08:33,025
- For goodness' sake. - She is it.

2026
01:08:33,320 --> 01:08:34,518
Everyone, Ji Hyo is it.

2027
01:08:34,519 --> 01:08:35,718
It just means...

2028
01:08:35,719 --> 01:08:38,459
- we have terrible teamwork. - Don't be ridiculous.

2029
01:08:38,460 --> 01:08:39,935
- I am serious. - Ji Hyo is it.

2030
01:08:39,960 --> 01:08:41,289
I am really not it.

2031
01:08:41,290 --> 01:08:42,605
(Ji Hyo is suspicious.)

2032
01:08:43,830 --> 01:08:45,745
I am really not it. I swear.

2033
01:08:46,299 --> 01:08:47,468
I swear.

2034
01:08:47,469 --> 01:08:49,338
Your shoulders should stay touching the floor...

2035
01:08:49,339 --> 01:08:50,338
even if you lift your head.

2036
01:08:50,339 --> 01:08:52,138
- Let's go. - Let's go.

2037
01:08:52,139 --> 01:08:53,285
Get ready.

2038
01:08:55,240 --> 01:08:56,584
There you go.

2039
01:08:56,740 --> 01:08:58,525
Hold it. Go slow. It's okay.

2040
01:08:58,679 --> 01:08:59,954
- All right. - It isn't easy.

2041
01:09:00,349 --> 01:09:01,855
Gosh, it's cold.

2042
01:09:02,250 --> 01:09:04,294
(Why did it have to spill over there?)

2043
01:09:04,379 --> 01:09:06,695
- What is going on? - It's cold.

2044
01:09:06,950 --> 01:09:08,695
- It isn't easy. - Hold it.

2045
01:09:09,219 --> 01:09:10,464
- Okay. - We have to do this.

2046
01:09:11,259 --> 01:09:12,428
Gosh, it's cold.

2047
01:09:12,429 --> 01:09:13,535
(Spilling)

2048
01:09:13,559 --> 01:09:14,874
Gosh, it's cold.

2049
01:09:14,960 --> 01:09:16,275
- It's cold. - Keep going.

2050
01:09:16,629 --> 01:09:18,928
(So Min practically waters her belly.)

2051
01:09:18,929 --> 01:09:20,245
So Min.

2052
01:09:20,530 --> 01:09:21,638
Make sure you hold it tight.

2053
01:09:21,639 --> 01:09:23,199
- We will win. - There you go.

2054
01:09:23,200 --> 01:09:25,468
Give it to me as it is. There you go.

2055
01:09:25,469 --> 01:09:27,438
- Is there anything to pour? - Okay.

2056
01:09:27,439 --> 01:09:28,615
(It's time to pour water into the bowl.)

2057
01:09:29,439 --> 01:09:32,325
(Jae Seok pours it onto the floor.)

2058
01:09:32,379 --> 01:09:33,649
- Here you go. - You should know that...

2059
01:09:33,650 --> 01:09:35,279
Jae Seok spilled the most amount of water.

2060
01:09:35,280 --> 01:09:36,548
(Kwang Soo tells on Jae Seok.)

2061
01:09:36,549 --> 01:09:38,188
- Jae Seok spilled everything... - Be quiet.

2062
01:09:38,189 --> 01:09:39,449
- on the floor. - Jae Seok!

2063
01:09:39,450 --> 01:09:41,588
- Trust me, Hyun Hee. - Jae Seok.

2064
01:09:41,589 --> 01:09:43,388
Here you go. Hold it, So Min.

2065
01:09:43,389 --> 01:09:45,329
- So Min is bad at this. - Hold it tight.

2066
01:09:45,330 --> 01:09:46,664
- I am holding it tight. - Hold it tight. Okay.

2067
01:09:46,990 --> 01:09:48,829
- It's cold. - There you go.

2068
01:09:48,830 --> 01:09:50,275
Balance the tray.

2069
01:09:50,559 --> 01:09:53,145
(Spilling)

2070
01:09:53,170 --> 01:09:55,098
So Min spills the most amount of water.

2071
01:09:55,099 --> 01:09:57,214
- So Min is... - She is suspicious.

2072
01:09:57,570 --> 01:09:59,508
I didn't spill a lot.

2073
01:09:59,509 --> 01:10:01,245
- Seok Jin spilled more earlier. - Okay, okay.

2074
01:10:01,580 --> 01:10:02,878
(There is another member who is bad at the game.)

2075
01:10:02,879 --> 01:10:05,109
(Jae Seok)

2076
01:10:05,110 --> 01:10:06,348
Okay, okay.

2077
01:10:06,349 --> 01:10:08,779
- This is the last one. - When the tray reaches the end,

2078
01:10:08,780 --> 01:10:11,348
- Jae Seok spills everything. - Be quiet.

2079
01:10:11,349 --> 01:10:13,264
There are so many spies.

2080
01:10:13,290 --> 01:10:14,449
Be quiet.

2081
01:10:14,450 --> 01:10:16,895
Jae Seok is acting strange too. Everyone is acting strange.

2082
01:10:17,059 --> 01:10:18,659
As for Jae Seok, I am clueless.

2083
01:10:18,660 --> 01:10:19,928
I am really not it.

2084
01:10:19,929 --> 01:10:22,029
- You have one minute left. - Let's calm down.

2085
01:10:22,030 --> 01:10:24,634
I didn't spill a single drop.

2086
01:10:25,370 --> 01:10:26,745
Pour it into the bowl as it is.

2087
01:10:26,969 --> 01:10:28,645
Look... What?

2088
01:10:28,900 --> 01:10:31,199
(Jae Seok spills it onto the floor.)

2089
01:10:31,200 --> 01:10:32,338
This makes no sense.

2090
01:10:32,339 --> 01:10:34,384
What's the point of transferring water?

2091
01:10:34,769 --> 01:10:37,409
- The last member spills everything. - It's hard to aim.

2092
01:10:37,410 --> 01:10:38,878
- It's hard to aim. - Jae Seok.

2093
01:10:38,879 --> 01:10:40,954
Hyun Hee, it's hard to aim.

2094
01:10:41,620 --> 01:10:43,619
Se Chan, this is the last one. Fill it to the brim.

2095
01:10:43,620 --> 01:10:45,119
(3 minutes end!)

2096
01:10:45,120 --> 01:10:46,764
- I have no idea who will win. - I have no idea.

2097
01:10:46,990 --> 01:10:49,218
We'll know once we compare them.

2098
01:10:49,219 --> 01:10:50,565
We have more water, right?

2099
01:10:51,089 --> 01:10:52,529
We have more water.

2100
01:10:52,530 --> 01:10:55,199
- We have more water. We won. - They have more water.

2101
01:10:55,200 --> 01:10:56,529
- Yes. - Yes.

2102
01:10:56,530 --> 01:10:58,569
(Jae Seok's team will choose who gets to eat!)

2103
01:10:58,570 --> 01:11:00,775
- We need to choose carefully. - Choose carefully.

2104
01:11:00,799 --> 01:11:02,775
- Choose carefully. - Who should get to eat?

2105
01:11:03,040 --> 01:11:04,539
Leave the two of them out.

2106
01:11:04,540 --> 01:11:05,709
Seok Jin. You ate, right?

2107
01:11:05,710 --> 01:11:07,008
Who should we exclude?

2108
01:11:07,009 --> 01:11:08,338
- Exclude Seok Jin. - I am not a greedy pig.

2109
01:11:08,339 --> 01:11:09,754
- Kwang Soo ate. - Should we stand over here?

2110
01:11:10,009 --> 01:11:13,008
Ji Hyo, So Min, and Jong Kook didn't eat.

2111
01:11:13,009 --> 01:11:14,084
Three of them didn't eat.

2112
01:11:14,349 --> 01:11:17,754
I am suspicious of Ji Hyo.

2113
01:11:18,349 --> 01:11:20,018
- Ji Hyo was strange. - Ji Hyo...

2114
01:11:20,019 --> 01:11:22,094
- Should we pick Ji Hyo? - You should be happy.

2115
01:11:22,360 --> 01:11:24,435
I want to eat because I am hungry,

2116
01:11:24,689 --> 01:11:27,105
but I hate being suspected.

2117
01:11:27,689 --> 01:11:29,359
I strongly recommend So Min.

2118
01:11:29,360 --> 01:11:30,359
Good thinking.

2119
01:11:30,360 --> 01:11:33,029
- You can choose me. I want to eat. - Am I the only one with a chance?

2120
01:11:33,030 --> 01:11:34,699
- So Min was more suspicious. - All right.

2121
01:11:34,700 --> 01:11:36,039
- Ji Hyo... - So Min was more suspicious.

2122
01:11:36,040 --> 01:11:37,445
- and the two of you should eat. - So Min was more suspicious.

2123
01:11:37,700 --> 01:11:39,445
Ji Hyo, Hyun Hee, and me.

2124
01:11:39,710 --> 01:11:41,008
- All right. - Okay.

2125
01:11:41,009 --> 01:11:42,084
Among the three of you,

2126
01:11:42,339 --> 01:11:43,338
the number...

2127
01:11:43,339 --> 01:11:44,338
(Among Hyun Hee, Ji Hyo, and Jae Seok,)

2128
01:11:44,339 --> 01:11:46,008
of greedy pigs is...

2129
01:11:46,009 --> 01:11:48,678
(the number of greedy pigs is...)

2130
01:11:48,679 --> 01:11:49,678
one.

2131
01:11:49,679 --> 01:11:52,018
(One)

2132
01:11:52,019 --> 01:11:54,348
- I knew it. - What does it mean?

2133
01:11:54,349 --> 01:11:55,435
Okay.

2134
01:11:55,759 --> 01:11:57,018
- What was the number? - Hey.

2135
01:11:57,019 --> 01:11:58,688
I am not it.

2136
01:11:58,689 --> 01:12:01,105
What was the number? One?

2137
01:12:01,360 --> 01:12:03,029
- It's one of them. - I have a chance.

2138
01:12:03,030 --> 01:12:05,029
- But Hyun Hee ate earlier. - I ate earlier.

2139
01:12:05,030 --> 01:12:07,029
- She ate earlier. - She ate earlier,

2140
01:12:07,030 --> 01:12:08,775
but there were other people.

2141
01:12:09,040 --> 01:12:11,115
- There were other people. - Hyun Hee, did you eat earlier?

2142
01:12:11,370 --> 01:12:13,239
- Who did you eat with earlier? - Me?

2143
01:12:13,240 --> 01:12:14,338
- Me. - Jae Seok,

2144
01:12:14,339 --> 01:12:15,779
- Kwang Soo, and... - Me.

2145
01:12:15,780 --> 01:12:16,855
Me.

2146
01:12:17,009 --> 01:12:18,754
- Four people ate earlier. - Yes.

2147
01:12:19,009 --> 01:12:21,008
- The number was 1, right? - 1.

2148
01:12:21,009 --> 01:12:23,018
- The number is 1 now. - It's 1.

2149
01:12:23,019 --> 01:12:24,018
So I am not it.

2150
01:12:24,019 --> 01:12:25,764
- It's one of them. - That doesn't prove your innocence.

2151
01:12:26,019 --> 01:12:27,688
- That doesn't prove your innocence. - Earlier, it was Kwang Soo.

2152
01:12:27,689 --> 01:12:29,688
- Now, it's Ji Hyo. - That's right.

2153
01:12:29,689 --> 01:12:31,764
- Now, it's Ji Hyo. - That's right.

2154
01:12:32,030 --> 01:12:33,029
No, no.

2155
01:12:33,030 --> 01:12:34,359
- I am not it. - Seok Jin is right.

2156
01:12:34,360 --> 01:12:35,435
Seok Jin is right.

2157
01:12:35,700 --> 01:12:37,105
Which one of you is it?

2158
01:12:37,700 --> 01:12:38,699
- No. - Which one of you is it?

2159
01:12:38,700 --> 01:12:41,445
Since I am not it, one of them is it.

2160
01:12:41,700 --> 01:12:43,775
- I am not it. - I am really not it.

2161
01:12:44,040 --> 01:12:46,039
- I am really not it. - You are it.

2162
01:12:46,040 --> 01:12:48,414
(Are Kwang Soo and Ji Hyo the greedy pigs?)

2163
01:12:49,339 --> 01:12:51,754
Gosh, hold on. This is braised seafood and vegetables.

2164
01:12:53,009 --> 01:12:55,084
I can't believe I am eating braised seafood and vegetables.

2165
01:12:56,679 --> 01:12:58,424
It smells so good.

2166
01:12:59,019 --> 01:13:00,764
- My goodness. - Eat that as well.

2167
01:13:01,349 --> 01:13:02,435
It looks delicious.

2168
01:13:03,689 --> 01:13:07,105
As you eat, we will distribute the ballot.

2169
01:13:07,360 --> 01:13:08,699
- It's so tasty. - Will we have the vote now?

2170
01:13:08,700 --> 01:13:09,775
- Do we pick two people? - Yes.

2171
01:13:10,360 --> 01:13:13,369
If two greedy pigs get the majority vote,

2172
01:13:13,370 --> 01:13:14,775
they will get the penalty.

2173
01:13:15,030 --> 01:13:16,369
If two greedy pigs don't get caught,

2174
01:13:16,370 --> 01:13:18,369
they will choose two members who will get the penalty.

2175
01:13:18,370 --> 01:13:19,785
Both greedy pigs need to be caught.

2176
01:13:20,009 --> 01:13:21,338
I am done.

2177
01:13:21,339 --> 01:13:22,338
I am done.

2178
01:13:22,339 --> 01:13:23,754
What should I do?

2179
01:13:25,009 --> 01:13:26,678
(I picked you, Kwang Soo.)

2180
01:13:26,679 --> 01:13:27,754
My goodness.

2181
01:13:28,009 --> 01:13:29,678
- I am really not it. - I am done.

2182
01:13:29,679 --> 01:13:30,754
I am done.

2183
01:13:31,349 --> 01:13:32,424
I am done.

2184
01:13:33,349 --> 01:13:34,424
Let me see.

2185
01:13:35,019 --> 01:13:36,359
He showed me that. I can't believe...

2186
01:13:36,360 --> 01:13:39,029
he wrote down my name and showed it to me.

2187
01:13:39,030 --> 01:13:42,029
- I am not it! Come to your senses! - All right.

2188
01:13:42,030 --> 01:13:44,105
He has been that way since the opening!

2189
01:13:45,030 --> 01:13:46,775
- All right. - I am not it. Don't be absurd.

2190
01:13:47,030 --> 01:13:48,445
Ji Hyo, are you it or not?

2191
01:13:50,370 --> 01:13:52,115
- What? - I swear I am not it.

2192
01:13:52,710 --> 01:13:53,709
Seriously.

2193
01:13:53,710 --> 01:13:55,084
You should tell me more.

2194
01:13:55,339 --> 01:13:57,678
There is no way I can prove myself.

2195
01:13:57,679 --> 01:13:59,678
She isn't even writing down any names.

2196
01:13:59,679 --> 01:14:01,084
I don't even have a pen, Hyun Hee.

2197
01:14:01,349 --> 01:14:03,348
Let me give you other possibilities.

2198
01:14:03,349 --> 01:14:06,018
If Ji Hyo isn't it, So Min is it.

2199
01:14:06,019 --> 01:14:08,094
If Kwang Soo isn't it,

2200
01:14:08,349 --> 01:14:09,688
- Jae Seok or Hyun Hee is it. - Jae Seok.

2201
01:14:09,689 --> 01:14:11,359
- No, no. - I am not it.

2202
01:14:11,360 --> 01:14:14,029
- There is a possibility. - Jae Seok isn't it.

2203
01:14:14,030 --> 01:14:15,699
Since I am not it, Kwang Soo is it.

2204
01:14:15,700 --> 01:14:17,029
- I have no idea. - Seok Jin.

2205
01:14:17,030 --> 01:14:18,029
- Are you not it? - No.

2206
01:14:18,030 --> 01:14:19,369
Then it's Kwang Soo.

2207
01:14:19,370 --> 01:14:20,369
- Kwang Soo. - It's Kwang Soo.

2208
01:14:20,370 --> 01:14:21,369
Why do you think that?

2209
01:14:21,370 --> 01:14:23,039
- Kwang Soo. - It's him.

2210
01:14:23,040 --> 01:14:24,369
It's him. It's him.

2211
01:14:24,370 --> 01:14:26,039
Whose names did you write down? Tell us.

2212
01:14:26,040 --> 01:14:27,039
- Who did you pick? - Who did you pick?

2213
01:14:27,040 --> 01:14:28,338
Why didn't you write down any names?

2214
01:14:28,339 --> 01:14:30,008
- You didn't write down any names. - Kwang Soo.

2215
01:14:30,009 --> 01:14:31,678
I was under suspicion all day long!

2216
01:14:31,679 --> 01:14:33,348
Why didn't you write down any names?

2217
01:14:33,349 --> 01:14:34,678
I tried to prove my innocence all day long!

2218
01:14:34,679 --> 01:14:36,348
You are being suspicious.

2219
01:14:36,349 --> 01:14:39,018
- You left it blank since it's you. - Write down the names now.

2220
01:14:39,019 --> 01:14:40,764
- Who will you pick? - Who will you pick?

2221
01:14:41,019 --> 01:14:42,688
- I am the most curious. - I am the most curious.

2222
01:14:42,689 --> 01:14:44,094
Why would I show you when this is the secret ballot?

2223
01:14:44,360 --> 01:14:46,029
- Show us. - Let's have a good laugh.

2224
01:14:46,030 --> 01:14:47,688
- Write down the names. - Whom will you pick?

2225
01:14:47,689 --> 01:14:49,029
- You are good at deducting. - I am really not it.

2226
01:14:49,030 --> 01:14:51,105
You should be the first to write,

2227
01:14:51,700 --> 01:14:52,699
"Me".

2228
01:14:52,700 --> 01:14:54,699
(That's quite original.)

2229
01:14:54,700 --> 01:14:55,844
Why would I do that?

2230
01:14:56,040 --> 01:14:57,699
Why would I do that when I am not it?

2231
01:14:57,700 --> 01:14:59,039
- Seriously. - Listen.

2232
01:14:59,040 --> 01:15:00,669
You should help us by deducing with us.

2233
01:15:00,670 --> 01:15:02,084
Who do you think are the greedy pigs?

2234
01:15:02,679 --> 01:15:04,008
- Jae Seok? - Jae Seok?

2235
01:15:04,009 --> 01:15:06,348
- Is he writing down my name? - Who is the other one?

2236
01:15:06,349 --> 01:15:07,678
Ji Hyo is suspicious, right?

2237
01:15:07,679 --> 01:15:08,678
It's delicious.

2238
01:15:08,679 --> 01:15:11,348
Ji Hyo and Jae Seok can't be the greedy pigs at the same time.

2239
01:15:11,349 --> 01:15:13,348
- Am I wrong? - You are right.

2240
01:15:13,349 --> 01:15:15,359
- You are right. - If Jae Seok is it, Ji Hyo isn't.

2241
01:15:15,360 --> 01:15:16,688
- Then who is it? - Then it's Ji Hyo.

2242
01:15:16,689 --> 01:15:18,094
(He changes his mind right away.)

2243
01:15:19,030 --> 01:15:21,029
- You are so easily swayed. - It's not like that.

2244
01:15:21,030 --> 01:15:23,029
All day long, I gave reasons for why I am not it.

2245
01:15:23,030 --> 01:15:25,369
- You are halfway there. - You are 50 percent complete.

2246
01:15:25,370 --> 01:15:26,369
Go for the 100 percent.

2247
01:15:26,370 --> 01:15:29,445
Come to think of it, you and I ate earlier.

2248
01:15:29,700 --> 01:15:31,699
- Do you think it's me? - Since I am not it, you are it.

2249
01:15:31,700 --> 01:15:33,039
Okay! I got you, you rascal.

2250
01:15:33,040 --> 01:15:35,414
(Okay! I got you, you rascal.)

2251
01:15:35,679 --> 01:15:37,008
(He refuses to write down his name.)

2252
01:15:37,009 --> 01:15:38,338
- I am really not it. - "Okay! I got you, you rascal."

2253
01:15:38,339 --> 01:15:39,424
I am really not it.

2254
01:15:39,679 --> 01:15:41,348
- It can't be Seok Jin. - Seriously.

2255
01:15:41,349 --> 01:15:43,018
Then it's me.

2256
01:15:43,019 --> 01:15:45,424
Then it's either me or So Min. It's either one of us.

2257
01:15:45,689 --> 01:15:47,348
But it can't be Ji Hyo then.

2258
01:15:47,349 --> 01:15:50,018
It doesn't make sense then because the number was one earlier.

2259
01:15:50,019 --> 01:15:51,094
So who are the greedy pigs?

2260
01:15:51,360 --> 01:15:52,688
You need to decide.

2261
01:15:52,689 --> 01:15:54,359
You will get the answer only if you write down your name.

2262
01:15:54,360 --> 01:15:56,775
(This is the conclusion.)

2263
01:15:57,360 --> 01:15:58,699
How did this happen?

2264
01:15:58,700 --> 01:16:00,699
Where did the puzzle go wrong?

2265
01:16:00,700 --> 01:16:02,039
- You need to write down your name. - How is that the conclusion?

2266
01:16:02,040 --> 01:16:04,115
Why would I get the answer only if I write down my name?

2267
01:16:04,700 --> 01:16:07,369
You can't deduce further because you left your name out.

2268
01:16:07,370 --> 01:16:09,008
Seok Jin is it if I am not it, right?

2269
01:16:09,009 --> 01:16:10,338
That's the answer for you.

2270
01:16:10,339 --> 01:16:11,754
- This is hilarious. - Okay.

2271
01:16:12,009 --> 01:16:14,084
All right. That was hard.

2272
01:16:14,679 --> 01:16:17,424
For fairness, we will call out the names.

2273
01:16:17,679 --> 01:16:20,018
Seok Jin chose Kwang Soo and Ji Hyo.

2274
01:16:20,019 --> 01:16:21,188
- Most people did the same. - Jong Kook chose...

2275
01:16:21,189 --> 01:16:23,018
- Kwang Soo and Ji Hyo. - Most people did the same.

2276
01:16:23,019 --> 01:16:25,688
Jae Seok chose Kwang Soo and Ji Hyo.

2277
01:16:25,689 --> 01:16:27,359
So Min chose Kwang Soo and Ji Hyo.

2278
01:16:27,360 --> 01:16:28,699
It's never like that.

2279
01:16:28,700 --> 01:16:30,435
- It's the majority vote. - Haha chose Kwang Soo and Ji Hyo.

2280
01:16:31,360 --> 01:16:33,105
Se Chan chose Kwang Soo and Ji Hyo.

2281
01:16:33,700 --> 01:16:35,369
Hyun Hee chose Kwang Soo and Ji Hyo.

2282
01:16:35,370 --> 01:16:37,039
Ji Hyun chose So Min and Hyun Hee.

2283
01:16:37,040 --> 01:16:39,039
(It's unexpected.)

2284
01:16:39,040 --> 01:16:40,039
(Us?)

2285
01:16:40,040 --> 01:16:41,745
Ji Hyo chose So Min and Hyun Hee.

2286
01:16:42,679 --> 01:16:44,754
Kwang Soo chose Ji Hyo and Seok Jin.

2287
01:16:45,679 --> 01:16:49,094
Thus, Kwang Soo and Ji Hyo received the most number of votes.

2288
01:16:49,349 --> 01:16:51,348
(Are Kwang Soo and Ji Hyo the greedy pigs?)

2289
01:16:51,349 --> 01:16:54,018
Kwang Soo and Ji Hyo...

2290
01:16:54,019 --> 01:16:55,359
(Either they receive the penalty...)

2291
01:16:55,360 --> 01:16:59,105
(or the real greedy pigs choose two members to receive the penalty.)

2292
01:17:00,689 --> 01:17:01,764
They aren't greedy pigs.

2293
01:17:02,700 --> 01:17:04,435
- No? - They aren't greedy pigs.

2294
01:17:04,700 --> 01:17:06,029
(They aren't greedy pigs!)

2295
01:17:06,030 --> 01:17:08,029
Since you failed to catch both greedy pigs,

2296
01:17:08,030 --> 01:17:09,115
the greedy pigs win.

2297
01:17:09,370 --> 01:17:10,699
- Who are the greedy pigs? - Who are they?

2298
01:17:10,700 --> 01:17:12,369
- It must be So Min. - Seriously.

2299
01:17:12,370 --> 01:17:14,414
If you are a greedy pig,

2300
01:17:14,670 --> 01:17:16,678
please stand up on the count of 3. 1,

2301
01:17:16,679 --> 01:17:18,279
(Who are the two greedy pigs?)

2302
01:17:18,280 --> 01:17:19,424
Two.

2303
01:17:20,679 --> 01:17:22,018
(The greedy pigs are...)

2304
01:17:22,019 --> 01:17:23,018
Three.

2305
01:17:23,019 --> 01:17:24,348
(The greedy pigs are...)

2306
01:17:24,349 --> 01:17:28,018
(So Min and Hyun Hee.)

2307
01:17:28,019 --> 01:17:29,018
Are they the greedy pigs?

2308
01:17:29,019 --> 01:17:30,435
(Shocked)

2309
01:17:31,360 --> 01:17:33,029
(The night before the race, SBS Building in Mok-dong)

2310
01:17:33,030 --> 01:17:34,688
Tomorrow,

2311
01:17:34,689 --> 01:17:37,128
you will be in the race called Let's Eat with Greedy Pigs.

2312
01:17:37,129 --> 01:17:38,359
Greedy pigs?

2313
01:17:38,360 --> 01:17:40,369
The two of you are the greedy pigs.

2314
01:17:40,370 --> 01:17:41,445
Really?

2315
01:17:42,700 --> 01:17:44,369
Let me know.

2316
01:17:44,370 --> 01:17:47,745
(Hyun Hee avoided suspicion by obtaining the chance.)

2317
01:17:48,339 --> 01:17:52,424
(By making frequent mistakes, So Min avoided eating.)

2318
01:17:53,009 --> 01:17:56,478
(Greedy pigs avoided suspicion with completely different tactics.)

2319
01:17:56,479 --> 01:17:58,218
I was right.

2320
01:17:58,219 --> 01:18:01,489
Why didn't you believe me? Why did you keep cornering me?

2321
01:18:01,490 --> 01:18:02,819
Ji Hyo, you should have told us.

2322
01:18:02,820 --> 01:18:04,819
- I did, - Why didn't you tell us?

2323
01:18:04,820 --> 01:18:07,188
but you kept cornering me.

2324
01:18:07,189 --> 01:18:09,128
Why didn't you say that you weren't it?

2325
01:18:09,129 --> 01:18:10,558
You kept cornering me.

2326
01:18:10,559 --> 01:18:12,199
How can I say anything?

2327
01:18:12,200 --> 01:18:14,798
- Why didn't you insist on it? - I did insist.

2328
01:18:14,799 --> 01:18:16,438
- When? - Since a long time ago.

2329
01:18:16,439 --> 01:18:18,544
- You're joking. - Goodness.

2330
01:18:18,969 --> 01:18:21,739
Tell us who will be...

2331
01:18:21,740 --> 01:18:23,355
- penalized. - We'll tell you.

2332
01:18:24,009 --> 01:18:26,378
- I trust you, So Min. - Tell us one person.

2333
01:18:26,379 --> 01:18:27,909
We need someone tall...

2334
01:18:27,910 --> 01:18:29,548
- because... - That's right.

2335
01:18:29,549 --> 01:18:30,649
(She doesn't even hesitate.)

2336
01:18:30,650 --> 01:18:31,819
(He's tall.)

2337
01:18:31,820 --> 01:18:33,989
- Me? - It could be a dump truck.

2338
01:18:33,990 --> 01:18:35,558
I'm not meticulous.

2339
01:18:35,559 --> 01:18:37,094
He was suspected all day long.

2340
01:18:37,259 --> 01:18:38,989
- He was suspected all day long. - He was suspected.

2341
01:18:38,990 --> 01:18:40,529
He cleaned the ceiling.

2342
01:18:40,530 --> 01:18:42,558
- That's why... - Don't you need someone strong?

2343
01:18:42,559 --> 01:18:43,628
(Don't you need someone strong?)

2344
01:18:43,629 --> 01:18:45,304
(He's someone strong.)

2345
01:18:45,500 --> 01:18:47,499
It would be terrible if they stayed apart.

2346
01:18:47,500 --> 01:18:49,239
We want them to have a good time.

2347
01:18:49,240 --> 01:18:51,975
- Hold each other's hands. - Talk about things.

2348
01:18:52,000 --> 01:18:54,669
We pick the one who's tall and the one who's strong.

2349
01:18:54,670 --> 01:18:55,785
- Okay. - Let's go.

2350
01:18:55,879 --> 01:18:57,239
Let's go.

2351
01:18:57,240 --> 01:18:58,825
(We thank Hong Hyun Hee and Park Ji Hyun for being with us.)

2352
01:18:59,479 --> 01:19:00,548
(Located in Gangnam, Seoul)

2353
01:19:00,549 --> 01:19:02,449
You're penalized quite often.

2354
01:19:02,450 --> 01:19:05,825
It's so funny that you and I came here together.

2355
01:19:06,420 --> 01:19:08,594
I should have been careful from the start.

2356
01:19:08,920 --> 01:19:10,218
Okay, now I understand.

2357
01:19:10,219 --> 01:19:12,359
- Let's make up today. - Yes.

2358
01:19:12,360 --> 01:19:13,428
Seriously.

2359
01:19:13,429 --> 01:19:14,588
- Why... - When it's not, it's not.

2360
01:19:14,589 --> 01:19:16,258
do you keep acting that way?

2361
01:19:16,259 --> 01:19:17,459
Why do you live that way?

2362
01:19:17,460 --> 01:19:19,199
(Why do you live that way?)

2363
01:19:19,200 --> 01:19:20,428
What? Me?

2364
01:19:20,429 --> 01:19:23,245
Why do you act so suspicious?

2365
01:19:23,370 --> 01:19:25,609
- You know, don't you? - If I remember clearly,

2366
01:19:25,610 --> 01:19:27,308
I was standing still during the opening.

2367
01:19:27,309 --> 01:19:28,409
When I looked at you...

2368
01:19:28,410 --> 01:19:30,178
(He was very suspicious.)

2369
01:19:30,179 --> 01:19:32,185
Even at the end of the show,

2370
01:19:32,349 --> 01:19:33,678
when I looked at you...

2371
01:19:33,679 --> 01:19:35,949
People are relative.

2372
01:19:35,950 --> 01:19:37,548
You make me suspect you.

2373
01:19:37,549 --> 01:19:39,865
Did you suspect anyone other than me today?

2374
01:19:39,950 --> 01:19:41,294
No.

2375
01:19:41,820 --> 01:19:42,859
I didn't.

2376
01:19:42,860 --> 01:19:46,128
Get rid of any hard feelings...

2377
01:19:46,129 --> 01:19:48,029
- while washing the car. - That way?

2378
01:19:48,030 --> 01:19:49,704
All right, let's get washing.

2379
01:19:50,360 --> 01:19:53,004
- All your sins are disappearing. - Jong Kook.

2380
01:19:53,799 --> 01:19:55,428
- The water is strong. - Yes.

2381
01:19:55,429 --> 01:19:57,014
(They start rinsing.)

2382
01:19:57,870 --> 01:19:59,714
(He's looking at him carefully.)

2383
01:20:00,139 --> 01:20:02,384
- It's getting really clean. - Gosh.

2384
01:20:02,479 --> 01:20:04,115
It's amazing.

2385
01:20:06,710 --> 01:20:08,954
(The water must have got him.)

2386
01:20:09,979 --> 01:20:12,025
(Is it starting?)

2387
01:20:15,559 --> 01:20:18,264
(The water starts to rise.)

2388
01:20:18,860 --> 01:20:20,735
(Shall we start the game?)

2389
01:20:21,059 --> 01:20:23,374
(The car is only there as a decoration.)

2390
01:20:23,700 --> 01:20:24,899
(Impressed)

2391
01:20:24,900 --> 01:20:26,445
It's so clean.

2392
01:20:26,670 --> 01:20:28,968
I see why...

2393
01:20:28,969 --> 01:20:31,899
I see why people prefer to hand wash cars.

2394
01:20:31,900 --> 01:20:33,285
(They're cleaning pent-up hard feelings.)

2395
01:20:36,210 --> 01:20:37,409
Hey.

2396
01:20:37,410 --> 01:20:39,025
(Stop it.)

2397
01:20:40,210 --> 01:20:43,094
(Such an ending was expected.)

2398
01:20:44,120 --> 01:20:45,989
I see why people hand wash their cars.

2399
01:20:45,990 --> 01:20:47,848
- This is unbelievable. - Yes.

2400
01:20:47,849 --> 01:20:50,359
It feels like my body got cleaned too.

2401
01:20:50,360 --> 01:20:52,989
That's why people like hand car washes.

2402
01:20:52,990 --> 01:20:55,228
Don't ever act suspicious.

2403
01:20:55,229 --> 01:20:56,999
- Okay, I understand. - Promise.

2404
01:20:57,000 --> 01:20:58,174
(They promise a new start.)

2405
01:21:00,969 --> 01:21:03,098
(They start to suspect each other right away.)

2406
01:21:03,099 --> 01:21:04,669
(You have to suspect him first.)

2407
01:21:04,670 --> 01:21:06,844
(What started the suspicion?)

2408
01:21:07,570 --> 01:21:09,508
(It started at a peaceful animal farm.)

2409
01:21:09,509 --> 01:21:11,754
(Kang Han Na and Lee Gook Ju)

2410
01:21:12,110 --> 01:21:13,409
(Sihyeon)

2411
01:21:13,410 --> 01:21:14,949
(Even Hyun A could be a candidate.)

2412
01:21:14,950 --> 01:21:16,619
I want to measure it.

2413
01:21:16,620 --> 01:21:19,088
(While six pairs of animals are having a dance party)

2414
01:21:19,089 --> 01:21:21,848
(There's a forbidden animal that wasn't invited.)

2415
01:21:21,849 --> 01:21:23,319
There are two forbidden animals.

2416
01:21:23,320 --> 01:21:25,704
(It's a war in the wilderness.)

2417
01:21:26,290 --> 01:21:27,758
(Make deductions.)

2418
01:21:27,759 --> 01:21:29,058
(Suspect and...)

2419
01:21:29,059 --> 01:21:31,075
(interrogate)

2420
01:21:32,000 --> 01:21:35,075
(Can you trust the evidence you just saw?)

2421
01:21:35,639 --> 01:21:36,768
(Forbidden animals)

2422
01:21:36,769 --> 01:21:38,399
It's also dangerous for Jae Seok.

2423
01:21:38,400 --> 01:21:40,584
(Mysterious Animal Farm)
