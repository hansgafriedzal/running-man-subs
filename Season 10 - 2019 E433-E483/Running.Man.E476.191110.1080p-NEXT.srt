1
00:00:06,218 --> 00:00:07,613
- Hello. - Hi.

2
00:00:07,614 --> 00:00:09,313
- Hi. - Hi.

3
00:00:09,314 --> 00:00:10,983
Hello. Hi.

4
00:00:10,984 --> 00:00:12,800
There are so many hearts here.

5
00:00:13,055 --> 00:00:15,784
- Will there be a male guest today? - Yes, I think so.

6
00:00:15,785 --> 00:00:18,493
- There must be a male guest today. - Yes!

7
00:00:18,494 --> 00:00:20,169
Wait, is Jong Kook the guest?

8
00:00:20,225 --> 00:00:22,094
Look at his outfit. That's a pretty color.

9
00:00:22,095 --> 00:00:24,193
- Hello. - Hi, there. Hey, you.

10
00:00:24,194 --> 00:00:25,234
"Hey, you"?

11
00:00:25,235 --> 00:00:27,004
- What's up with your outfit? - What's wrong with it?

12
00:00:27,005 --> 00:00:28,504
- Look at the color. - Your outfit looks fancy.

13
00:00:28,505 --> 00:00:29,504
- It's fancy. - Why? It's nice.

14
00:00:29,505 --> 00:00:31,833
Goodness, Jong Kook is changing.

15
00:00:31,834 --> 00:00:33,144
- Se Chan. - Move to the side a bit.

16
00:00:33,145 --> 00:00:34,303
Why are your pants inside out?

17
00:00:34,304 --> 00:00:36,574
What do you mean? No, this is fashion.

18
00:00:36,575 --> 00:00:37,574
You wear them inside out.

19
00:00:37,575 --> 00:00:40,583
So Min is wearing her sweater inside out. They're a couple.

20
00:00:40,584 --> 00:00:42,684
- It looks like it's inside out. - She's wearing it inside out.

21
00:00:42,685 --> 00:00:46,153
- I guess this is trending nowadays. - I like it. It's for the LA Lakers.

22
00:00:46,154 --> 00:00:48,129
- What's wrong with you? - Stop that.

23
00:00:48,225 --> 00:00:50,653
(Her sudden shaking move flusters them.)

24
00:00:50,654 --> 00:00:52,093
Stop doing that!

25
00:00:52,094 --> 00:00:54,000
- We were looking at the picture. - Why do you...

26
00:00:54,664 --> 00:00:55,663
Why do you do that?

27
00:00:55,664 --> 00:00:56,763
It's like the illusion picture.

28
00:00:56,764 --> 00:00:57,870
- "Illusion"? - "Illusion"?

29
00:00:58,264 --> 00:01:00,303
(Her behaviors are indeed cheerful.)

30
00:01:00,304 --> 00:01:02,080
So Min asked this to Se Chan.

31
00:01:02,204 --> 00:01:04,273
"Why weren't you at the Sunday service yesterday?"

32
00:01:04,274 --> 00:01:05,979
He said that he had to do something else.

33
00:01:06,105 --> 00:01:07,879
She said, "My gosh, I looked so pretty yesterday."

34
00:01:09,675 --> 00:01:12,720
(I was the prettiest one at the church.)

35
00:01:13,115 --> 00:01:15,543
(The flow of conversation is beyond their expectation.)

36
00:01:15,544 --> 00:01:16,614
Goodness.

37
00:01:16,615 --> 00:01:18,314
She always keeps all of her options open.

38
00:01:18,315 --> 00:01:19,560
So Min...

39
00:01:19,655 --> 00:01:21,124
When I heard that, I clapped for her.

40
00:01:21,125 --> 00:01:23,124
- What she said was... - He complimented me.

41
00:01:23,125 --> 00:01:25,754
It was amazing. How could she come up with such a sweet line?

42
00:01:25,755 --> 00:01:27,724
- It's usually in the textbooks. - Right.

43
00:01:27,725 --> 00:01:28,894
That was amazing.

44
00:01:28,895 --> 00:01:31,709
- Detective Lee, what do you think? - "Detective Lee"?

45
00:01:32,235 --> 00:01:34,610
(He looks like a veteran detective in the crime division.)

46
00:01:34,865 --> 00:01:36,140
(Is he on a stakeout?)

47
00:01:36,274 --> 00:01:37,679
Me? Were you talking to me?

48
00:01:37,975 --> 00:01:40,674
- The color matches my soft at home. - Right.

49
00:01:40,675 --> 00:01:42,243
- Why would you bring that up now? - The color...

50
00:01:42,244 --> 00:01:43,920
- This suits the season well. - That's the color of my sofa.

51
00:01:44,444 --> 00:01:46,583
By the way, Seok Jin...

52
00:01:46,584 --> 00:01:48,314
- asked me this earlier. - Ask what?

53
00:01:48,315 --> 00:01:50,353
- He'll go on a trip by himself. - To where?

54
00:01:50,354 --> 00:01:51,654
- He asked if the Czech Republic... - By himself?

55
00:01:51,655 --> 00:01:52,924
- is a good place to go alone. - Really?

56
00:01:52,925 --> 00:01:55,583
- But you never go on trips alone. - I'm planning to do that this time.

57
00:01:55,584 --> 00:01:56,594
I was going to go with my wife, but...

58
00:01:56,595 --> 00:01:58,569
- He must be seeing another woman. - No, that's not true.

59
00:01:59,964 --> 00:02:01,124
(This is rated-12. What are you saying?)

60
00:02:01,125 --> 00:02:02,693
- No, that's not true. - You're not?

61
00:02:02,694 --> 00:02:04,269
What are you talking about? Hey.

62
00:02:04,294 --> 00:02:05,993
- He said he was seeing a woman. - Hey.

63
00:02:05,994 --> 00:02:07,179
Can we talk about this on TV?

64
00:02:07,834 --> 00:02:09,103
- Can we talk about this? - Hey.

65
00:02:09,104 --> 00:02:10,933
Jong Kook, you must think this is an American TV show.

66
00:02:10,934 --> 00:02:12,980
In my opinion, he might've been kicked out of his house.

67
00:02:14,375 --> 00:02:17,013
(Jee Seok Jin, a 54-year-old man in a crisis)

68
00:02:17,014 --> 00:02:18,274
- That might've been it. - No.

69
00:02:18,275 --> 00:02:20,784
- Seok Jin, stay in the dry sauna. - That's not true.

70
00:02:20,785 --> 00:02:22,890
He's planning to go to a dry sauna in Prague.

71
00:02:23,454 --> 00:02:25,284
- Or places like that. - Right.

72
00:02:25,285 --> 00:02:26,929
- None of my friends went there. - I see.

73
00:02:27,625 --> 00:02:28,830
Thank you for letting me go.

74
00:02:29,255 --> 00:02:30,393
That's interesting.

75
00:02:30,394 --> 00:02:32,154
By the way, I can see we're having...

76
00:02:32,155 --> 00:02:33,800
- a lot of guests. - I see hearts.

77
00:02:34,194 --> 00:02:35,564
I like hearts.

78
00:02:35,565 --> 00:02:38,709
So Min and Ji Hyo will go behind the door today.

79
00:02:39,664 --> 00:02:41,834
- They'll be part of it too? - So we're not having six guests.

80
00:02:41,835 --> 00:02:42,974
Ji Hyo.

81
00:02:42,975 --> 00:02:44,474
- They should think about us too. - Hey.

82
00:02:44,475 --> 00:02:46,404
- They always invite... - Actually, I saw it coming.

83
00:02:46,405 --> 00:02:47,474
They never invite guys.

84
00:02:47,475 --> 00:02:49,173
- Great. - This is nice and free.

85
00:02:49,174 --> 00:02:51,173
So Min and Se Chan might be a couple today.

86
00:02:51,174 --> 00:02:52,519
- That's true. - My gosh.

87
00:02:52,574 --> 00:02:54,619
It's only for the games. You'll be a game partner.

88
00:02:54,984 --> 00:02:57,429
- Good luck. - We don't expect anything.

89
00:02:58,114 --> 00:02:59,700
(I'll be the third guest.)

90
00:02:59,725 --> 00:03:01,024
Did you see? She'll be the third guest.

91
00:03:01,025 --> 00:03:02,453
- Let's go. - Number eight?

92
00:03:02,454 --> 00:03:04,999
I'll be the third guest. Se Chan, I'll be number three.

93
00:03:05,555 --> 00:03:07,070
Go. Just go.

94
00:03:08,065 --> 00:03:09,124
Just go.

95
00:03:09,125 --> 00:03:10,564
(What will happen to So Min and Se Chan?)

96
00:03:10,565 --> 00:03:12,309
Can you remove the hearts before we start?

97
00:03:12,694 --> 00:03:14,439
I guess there are photoshopped pictures.

98
00:03:15,204 --> 00:03:16,450
- What's that? - What is it?

99
00:03:16,875 --> 00:03:17,974
It's a fox.

100
00:03:17,975 --> 00:03:19,880
- Fox. - What does that mean?

101
00:03:19,905 --> 00:03:22,850
(Why does it say "fox" on it?)

102
00:03:23,574 --> 00:03:26,073
- Rabbit. - Rabbit. Like the Year of Rabbit?

103
00:03:26,074 --> 00:03:27,214
- Pig. - Pig.

104
00:03:27,215 --> 00:03:28,989
- I see. Pig. - Bear.

105
00:03:29,014 --> 00:03:30,830
- Tiger. - Tiger.

106
00:03:31,715 --> 00:03:33,999
- Snake? - They are Chinese Zodiac animals.

107
00:03:34,125 --> 00:03:35,529
Is fox one of the animals?

108
00:03:35,685 --> 00:03:37,393
No, fox isn't. Then, that's not it.

109
00:03:37,394 --> 00:03:38,494
- And bear isn't one of the animals. - Today,

110
00:03:38,495 --> 00:03:41,040
six couples of animals will participate in today's race.

111
00:03:41,095 --> 00:03:42,793
Excluding Ji Hyo and So Min,

112
00:03:42,794 --> 00:03:45,034
four female guests who will partner up with you...

113
00:03:45,035 --> 00:03:46,980
have chosen an animal and are waiting behind the doors now.

114
00:03:47,104 --> 00:03:48,633
You will play I Can Hear Your Cries...

115
00:03:48,634 --> 00:03:50,103
to choose your partners.

116
00:03:50,104 --> 00:03:51,603
(Mysterious Animal Farm Race: I Can Hear Your Cries)

117
00:03:51,604 --> 00:03:54,103
The male members can ask questions to the female members.

118
00:03:54,104 --> 00:03:57,320
And the female members will answer in their altered voice.

119
00:03:57,475 --> 00:03:59,684
After asking the question, if you like the answer,

120
00:03:59,685 --> 00:04:02,043
up to three male members can line up in front of the door.

121
00:04:02,044 --> 00:04:03,353
- Three is the maximum. - My gosh.

122
00:04:03,354 --> 00:04:04,353
The male members who lined up...

123
00:04:04,354 --> 00:04:08,630
will listen to the animal's cry and choose 1 from 3 choices.

124
00:04:08,884 --> 00:04:11,969
The member who picks the correct number will pair up with that guest.

125
00:04:11,995 --> 00:04:13,024
All right.

126
00:04:13,025 --> 00:04:14,369
We must listen to the cries.

127
00:04:14,664 --> 00:04:16,693
- It's their special talent then? - But won't this be...

128
00:04:16,694 --> 00:04:18,070
- really obvious? - We'll figure it out.

129
00:04:19,664 --> 00:04:22,563
The first female guest will receive questions now.

130
00:04:22,564 --> 00:04:24,974
Male members, you can ask questions to the female guest.

131
00:04:24,975 --> 00:04:26,444
- Are we starting with the fox? - The fox?

132
00:04:26,445 --> 00:04:27,644
- Ms. Fox. - Hello.

133
00:04:27,645 --> 00:04:28,749
Hello.

134
00:04:28,945 --> 00:04:29,944
Ms. Fox.

135
00:04:29,945 --> 00:04:31,720
Yes, it's me.

136
00:04:32,345 --> 00:04:33,884
(The way she talks sounds familiar.)

137
00:04:33,885 --> 00:04:34,983
- Ji Hyo? - By the way,

138
00:04:34,984 --> 00:04:36,144
- I don't think so. - By the way,

139
00:04:36,145 --> 00:04:37,730
are you a regular member of Running Man?

140
00:04:39,184 --> 00:04:40,400
No.

141
00:04:40,455 --> 00:04:41,454
She's not.

142
00:04:41,455 --> 00:04:43,499
Have you been on our show before?

143
00:04:43,655 --> 00:04:44,970
- Have you? - Yes.

144
00:04:45,025 --> 00:04:46,663
- Really? - She's been on our show before.

145
00:04:46,664 --> 00:04:48,869
What do you think your charm is?

146
00:04:49,025 --> 00:04:50,733
(Hesitant)

147
00:04:50,734 --> 00:04:52,210
Dance?

148
00:04:52,364 --> 00:04:54,210
- Dance? - It's dance?

149
00:04:54,265 --> 00:04:55,540
I guess it's not Ji Hyo.

150
00:04:55,604 --> 00:04:58,110
By the way, why did you choose the animal, fox?

151
00:04:58,275 --> 00:05:00,879
I look like a fox.

152
00:05:00,945 --> 00:05:04,113
- You resemble a fox? - I guess she looks like a fox.

153
00:05:04,114 --> 00:05:06,889
- She must resemble Ko So Young. - Right.

154
00:05:06,984 --> 00:05:08,660
Next up is Ms. Rabbit.

155
00:05:08,814 --> 00:05:10,530
- Hello, Ms. Rabbit. - Okay.

156
00:05:10,885 --> 00:05:12,660
Hello.

157
00:05:13,025 --> 00:05:14,123
- What was that? - Is she a ghost?

158
00:05:14,124 --> 00:05:15,454
(Is there a patient among the guests today?)

159
00:05:15,455 --> 00:05:17,224
- Hold on. She did that on purpose. - Is she a ghost?

160
00:05:17,225 --> 00:05:19,793
- It has to be one of them. - It's Ji Hyo or So Min.

161
00:05:19,794 --> 00:05:21,063
- It's one of them. - We got them.

162
00:05:21,064 --> 00:05:22,694
She didn't want to get caught.

163
00:05:22,695 --> 00:05:24,534
- We'll move on. - What?

164
00:05:24,535 --> 00:05:25,739
- We'll move on. - What?

165
00:05:26,164 --> 00:05:28,264
- This is So Min. - I think it's So Min.

166
00:05:28,265 --> 00:05:29,509
Aren't you So Min?

167
00:05:30,635 --> 00:05:31,780
What?

168
00:05:32,434 --> 00:05:34,119
You altered her voice, but it sounds so obvious.

169
00:05:34,475 --> 00:05:36,344
- Are you... - Why did you alter the voice?

170
00:05:36,345 --> 00:05:38,243
(As expected, the rabbit is So Min.)

171
00:05:38,244 --> 00:05:41,319
Have you been on our show before?

172
00:05:41,414 --> 00:05:43,730
No, it's my first time here.

173
00:05:44,085 --> 00:05:46,900
- Then, it's not Ji Hyo. - Who did you want to meet among us?

174
00:05:48,825 --> 00:05:50,499
My gosh, I'm really shy.

175
00:05:51,595 --> 00:05:53,363
(This voice...)

176
00:05:53,364 --> 00:05:54,670
- It's So Min. - This is weird.

177
00:05:55,294 --> 00:05:56,733
- It's So Min. - This is So Min.

178
00:05:56,734 --> 00:05:58,233
- It's So Min. - It's So Min.

179
00:05:58,234 --> 00:05:59,369
She's confusing me.

180
00:05:59,635 --> 00:06:01,233
- She's shy? - Okay.

181
00:06:01,234 --> 00:06:02,980
- Okay, Ms. Rabbit. - This is hard today.

182
00:06:03,174 --> 00:06:05,179
- Ms. Pig. - Yes.

183
00:06:05,304 --> 00:06:06,644
- She sounds confident. - She sounds confident.

184
00:06:06,645 --> 00:06:07,819
Aren't you Ji Hyo?

185
00:06:08,044 --> 00:06:09,074
- No. - Yes.

186
00:06:09,075 --> 00:06:10,913
- Ji Hyo wouldn't sound like this. - Right.

187
00:06:10,914 --> 00:06:13,844
Are you a singer?

188
00:06:13,845 --> 00:06:15,920
- Or are you an actress? - An actress?

189
00:06:15,984 --> 00:06:17,160
I'm...

190
00:06:17,684 --> 00:06:18,813
a singer.

191
00:06:18,814 --> 00:06:20,724
- Singer. - Singer.

192
00:06:20,725 --> 00:06:23,400
(Ms. Pig is a singer.)

193
00:06:23,424 --> 00:06:24,553
Why don't you sing for us?

194
00:06:24,554 --> 00:06:25,793
- Why did you ask that? - Come on, Seok Jin.

195
00:06:25,794 --> 00:06:27,993
(Why would you ask that to a guest?)

196
00:06:27,994 --> 00:06:29,224
- Come on. - Seok Jin.

197
00:06:29,225 --> 00:06:31,034
- Sing your favorite song. - Her voice is altered.

198
00:06:31,035 --> 00:06:32,964
- Why would you ask her that? - Why not? She can sing a song.

199
00:06:32,965 --> 00:06:37,474
From head to toe

200
00:06:37,475 --> 00:06:38,534
My gosh.

201
00:06:38,535 --> 00:06:39,780
- That's a great song. - That song...

202
00:06:40,604 --> 00:06:41,879
Isn't that Jin Young?

203
00:06:42,044 --> 00:06:43,774
- Who? Hong Jin Young? - Jin Young.

204
00:06:43,775 --> 00:06:44,813
(She does sound like Jin Young.)

205
00:06:44,814 --> 00:06:46,220
All right. Ms. Bear.

206
00:06:46,445 --> 00:06:50,214
Yes. Hello.

207
00:06:50,215 --> 00:06:51,689
- It's Ji Hyo. - This is Ji Hyo.

208
00:06:51,715 --> 00:06:53,059
This is Ji Hyo.

209
00:06:53,655 --> 00:06:55,199
I'm 100 percent sure.

210
00:06:55,285 --> 00:06:57,199
- It has to be her. - I'm certain of it.

211
00:06:57,294 --> 00:06:59,764
(The identity of the bear who altered the voice herself...)

212
00:06:59,765 --> 00:07:02,239
(is really Ji Hyo.)

213
00:07:02,695 --> 00:07:04,063
(Okay. Ji Hyo is the bear.)

214
00:07:04,064 --> 00:07:05,470
Do you live in Mapo?

215
00:07:05,864 --> 00:07:07,280
No,

216
00:07:07,535 --> 00:07:09,063
- It's her. - I don't live in Mapo.

217
00:07:09,064 --> 00:07:10,974
- It's Ji Hyo. - Hey.

218
00:07:10,975 --> 00:07:14,379
Ms. Bear. What was your opinion of Seok Jin?

219
00:07:14,945 --> 00:07:17,720
Mr. Jee Seok Jin is just Mr. Jee Seok Jin.

220
00:07:18,914 --> 00:07:20,259
She's not witty.

221
00:07:20,285 --> 00:07:22,090
- It has to be Ji Hyo. - It's Ji Hyo.

222
00:07:22,244 --> 00:07:24,113
She doesn't improvise on the spot. This is Ji Hyo.

223
00:07:24,114 --> 00:07:25,353
She doesn't improvise.

224
00:07:25,354 --> 00:07:26,784
- All right. - All right.

225
00:07:26,785 --> 00:07:28,923
- We got it, Ms. Bear. - Hello, Ji Hyo.

226
00:07:28,924 --> 00:07:30,199
Ms. Tiger.

227
00:07:30,424 --> 00:07:32,170
My gosh, hello.

228
00:07:32,254 --> 00:07:34,224
- What did she say? - Hello.

229
00:07:34,225 --> 00:07:35,770
- What did she say? - What did she say?

230
00:07:36,095 --> 00:07:38,464
Ms. Tiger, why did you choose the tiger?

231
00:07:38,465 --> 00:07:39,809
Well,

232
00:07:40,035 --> 00:07:43,350
I sort of have an unexpected charm.

233
00:07:43,374 --> 00:07:45,803
I'm quite strong.

234
00:07:45,804 --> 00:07:47,673
- Her voice sounds husky. - Her voice is hoarse. It's husky.

235
00:07:47,674 --> 00:07:49,844
You can't hide a husky voice even when you alter the voice.

236
00:07:49,845 --> 00:07:52,714
- I know who it is. - Who is it?

237
00:07:52,715 --> 00:07:54,290
(She's surprised.)

238
00:07:54,314 --> 00:07:55,514
Ms. Tiger.

239
00:07:55,515 --> 00:07:56,813
- Yes. - Her voice is husky.

240
00:07:56,814 --> 00:07:58,084
Aren't we in the same line of work?

241
00:07:58,085 --> 00:08:00,224
(Do they work in the same field?)

242
00:08:00,225 --> 00:08:01,353
(Is Ms. Tiger a comedienne?)

243
00:08:01,354 --> 00:08:03,059
- Hey, it's Lee Gook Ju! - My gosh.

244
00:08:03,124 --> 00:08:05,154
- Lee Gook Ju. - Aren't I right, Ms. Tiger?

245
00:08:05,155 --> 00:08:06,329
Don't we know each other?

246
00:08:06,825 --> 00:08:08,369
Didn't we film together last week?

247
00:08:09,124 --> 00:08:11,594
It's my first time meeting you, Se Chan.

248
00:08:11,595 --> 00:08:13,264
- It is her. - It's her first time?

249
00:08:13,265 --> 00:08:15,663
- It's Lee Gook Ju. - Did you not change her voice?

250
00:08:15,664 --> 00:08:17,280
They did, but I know it's Gook Ju.

251
00:08:17,304 --> 00:08:18,834
I don't think you altered her voice.

252
00:08:18,835 --> 00:08:20,079
Ms. Tiger.

253
00:08:20,275 --> 00:08:21,420
Ms. Tiger.

254
00:08:21,744 --> 00:08:23,743
- Gook Ju. - Gook Ju.

255
00:08:23,744 --> 00:08:25,014
Nice to see you, Gook Ju.

256
00:08:25,015 --> 00:08:26,989
- Ms. Tiger, don't you know me? - Gook Ju.

257
00:08:27,244 --> 00:08:28,960
- Don't we know each other? - Did you hear her laugh?

258
00:08:29,385 --> 00:08:30,514
Move back.

259
00:08:30,515 --> 00:08:32,183
(Move back.)

260
00:08:32,184 --> 00:08:33,400
Move back.

261
00:08:33,554 --> 00:08:36,183
(Ms. Tiger is Lee Gook Ju.)

262
00:08:36,184 --> 00:08:37,753
(Bursting into laughter)

263
00:08:37,754 --> 00:08:38,924
It's Gook Ju.

264
00:08:38,925 --> 00:08:41,623
- My goodness. Gook Ju. - What did you say?

265
00:08:41,624 --> 00:08:43,199
You invited me here! Darn it.

266
00:08:43,634 --> 00:08:45,410
- The voice alteration didn't work. - Hey.

267
00:08:45,634 --> 00:08:48,003
You guys invited me here. How dare you treat me this way? Hurry up!

268
00:08:48,004 --> 00:08:49,209
I'm sorry.

269
00:08:49,234 --> 00:08:51,349
Hey, her voice couldn't be altered.

270
00:08:51,404 --> 00:08:52,834
- Ms. Tiger. - Yes,

271
00:08:52,835 --> 00:08:54,574
Have you ever taken a dump at my house?

272
00:08:54,575 --> 00:08:57,414
(Have you ever taken a dump at my house?)

273
00:08:57,415 --> 00:08:59,319
(Nice words)

274
00:08:59,415 --> 00:09:02,120
Everyone at SBS knows that. Stop it!

275
00:09:02,715 --> 00:09:03,753
Seriously.

276
00:09:03,754 --> 00:09:04,783
(She freely takes a dump at his place.)

277
00:09:04,784 --> 00:09:06,660
Because of you, people still call me Rotten Toenails.

278
00:09:08,254 --> 00:09:09,253
(She's the source of Rotten Toenails.)

279
00:09:09,254 --> 00:09:11,493
Rotten Toenails of Seongsu-dong.

280
00:09:11,494 --> 00:09:13,699
It's definitely her. You can't fake this.

281
00:09:13,825 --> 00:09:14,964
You can't fake it.

282
00:09:14,965 --> 00:09:16,324
- Okay. - All right.

283
00:09:16,325 --> 00:09:18,370
- Next up is Ms. Snake. - Let's move onto Ms. Snake.

284
00:09:18,494 --> 00:09:20,140
- Ms. Snake. - Yes.

285
00:09:20,734 --> 00:09:22,839
Please introduce yourself to us. Tell us who you are.

286
00:09:22,864 --> 00:09:24,209
This is...

287
00:09:24,374 --> 00:09:26,273
my first time here.

288
00:09:26,274 --> 00:09:29,219
(A hint about her identity)

289
00:09:29,404 --> 00:09:30,544
It's her first time here.

290
00:09:30,545 --> 00:09:31,790
- Really? - I think it's her first time.

291
00:09:32,545 --> 00:09:33,990
What did you do yesterday?

292
00:09:34,445 --> 00:09:36,143
I practiced yesterday.

293
00:09:36,144 --> 00:09:37,589
- What? - What?

294
00:09:37,685 --> 00:09:38,890
What kind of practice?

295
00:09:39,384 --> 00:09:41,684
I practiced special talents.

296
00:09:41,685 --> 00:09:43,724
And I practiced what I should do on variety shows.

297
00:09:43,725 --> 00:09:45,194
- This must be her first. - She doesn't work in this industry.

298
00:09:45,195 --> 00:09:46,699
- She must be new to this. - She's new.

299
00:09:47,264 --> 00:09:49,670
How long has it been since your debut?

300
00:09:50,134 --> 00:09:52,533
- It's been only 7 months. - 7 months?

301
00:09:52,534 --> 00:09:54,233
- She's an idol singer. - Seven months?

302
00:09:54,234 --> 00:09:57,103
- Wait. We can figure it out then. - Right.

303
00:09:57,104 --> 00:09:58,233
We can figure it out then.

304
00:09:58,234 --> 00:10:00,403
- ITZY debuted less than a year ago. - ITZY?

305
00:10:00,404 --> 00:10:02,974
- ITZY debuted less than a year ago. - It hasn't been a year yet.

306
00:10:02,975 --> 00:10:04,143
Is it ITZY?

307
00:10:04,144 --> 00:10:06,414
(Is Ms. Snake a member of ITZY just like Se Chan's guess?)

308
00:10:06,415 --> 00:10:08,089
- Hold on. I got it. - You got it?

309
00:10:08,284 --> 00:10:10,184
- I have no idea. - First of all...

310
00:10:10,185 --> 00:10:11,829
First of all, let's avoid Ms. Tiger.

311
00:10:11,915 --> 00:10:12,983
Let's avoid Ms. Bear.

312
00:10:12,984 --> 00:10:14,883
- Ms. Bear is Ji Hyo. - Ms. Bear is Ji Hyo.

313
00:10:14,884 --> 00:10:16,954
- Ms. Tiger is Gook Ju. - Ms. Bear and Ms. Tiger.

314
00:10:16,955 --> 00:10:18,770
Which one is So Min? Is it Ms. Rabbit?

315
00:10:18,825 --> 00:10:22,123
- We'll start with Team Fox. - I forgot who she was.

316
00:10:22,124 --> 00:10:24,834
- I forgot her interview. - Her interview was short.

317
00:10:24,835 --> 00:10:26,633
I don't know who she is.

318
00:10:26,634 --> 00:10:27,939
I forgot everything.

319
00:10:27,965 --> 00:10:30,309
- I hope... - Okay.

320
00:10:30,675 --> 00:10:32,979
Seok Jin...

321
00:10:33,205 --> 00:10:36,373
- and Kwang Soo will choose me. - Why?

322
00:10:36,374 --> 00:10:37,714
- Why? - Is she in Apink?

323
00:10:37,715 --> 00:10:39,844
- I guess she wants to stand out. - I thought it'd be fun...

324
00:10:39,845 --> 00:10:41,760
- to play games together. - Is she in Apink?

325
00:10:41,915 --> 00:10:44,729
She doesn't know who will be her partner,

326
00:10:44,955 --> 00:10:46,314
but she wants someone she can easily control.

327
00:10:46,315 --> 00:10:48,300
- Jae Seok. - Hey, that's not true.

328
00:10:48,325 --> 00:10:50,329
- She likes bossing people around. - Right.

329
00:10:50,394 --> 00:10:52,194
- She must like bossing men around. - Yes.

330
00:10:52,195 --> 00:10:54,324
- No. - What are you saying?

331
00:10:54,325 --> 00:10:56,294
Don't make her misunderstand this. I'm not a pushover.

332
00:10:56,295 --> 00:10:58,733
- Go forward. - Go forward.

333
00:10:58,734 --> 00:11:00,609
- She picked you. Go. - Go.

334
00:11:01,134 --> 00:11:03,064
- I'm curious about her. - Me too.

335
00:11:03,065 --> 00:11:06,650
All right. Seok Jin and Kwang Soo are in front of Door One.

336
00:11:06,744 --> 00:11:09,444
You'll hear three different animal sounds.

337
00:11:09,445 --> 00:11:11,214
If you can guess which one's the guest's,

338
00:11:11,215 --> 00:11:13,490
- you'll become a couple. - This is easy.

339
00:11:13,984 --> 00:11:16,390
- We can't mimic them perfectly. - We need to pick the human sound?

340
00:11:16,514 --> 00:11:18,383
Here it is.

341
00:11:18,384 --> 00:11:20,383
This is number one of a fox's cry.

342
00:11:20,384 --> 00:11:22,099
(1st fox sound)

343
00:11:26,394 --> 00:11:27,800
- What? - What is this?

344
00:11:28,624 --> 00:11:30,863
(This is a fox?)

345
00:11:30,864 --> 00:11:32,064
This is a fox?

346
00:11:32,065 --> 00:11:33,434
The second cry.

347
00:11:33,435 --> 00:11:36,540
(2nd fox sound)

348
00:11:38,504 --> 00:11:40,050
I have no idea.

349
00:11:40,845 --> 00:11:44,344
(The sounds are too strange for them to differentiate.)

350
00:11:44,345 --> 00:11:46,819
(Dazed)

351
00:11:46,884 --> 00:11:48,944
- This is it. Number 2. - Number 2?

352
00:11:48,945 --> 00:11:51,253
- That one was strange. - This is the third cry.

353
00:11:51,254 --> 00:11:54,283
(3rd fox sound)

354
00:11:54,284 --> 00:11:55,559
- This one sounds strange too. - Really?

355
00:11:56,325 --> 00:11:58,569
(Listening)

356
00:11:58,595 --> 00:12:01,294
It's either number 2 or 3.

357
00:12:01,295 --> 00:12:03,069
This is crazy.

358
00:12:03,634 --> 00:12:06,439
She's talented. How could she do that?

359
00:12:06,494 --> 00:12:08,040
- This is hard. - I pick the second cry.

360
00:12:08,165 --> 00:12:10,109
I pick number two.

361
00:12:10,534 --> 00:12:11,750
You?

362
00:12:11,975 --> 00:12:13,474
- Kwang Soo? - I pick number three.

363
00:12:13,475 --> 00:12:15,674
- Number three. - If neither of you gets it right,

364
00:12:15,675 --> 00:12:17,574
we will move on.

365
00:12:17,575 --> 00:12:19,319
I pick number one.

366
00:12:19,975 --> 00:12:21,660
The answer is...

367
00:12:22,545 --> 00:12:25,513
(Is it Kwang Soo's pick, number 1?)

368
00:12:25,514 --> 00:12:28,883
(Or is it Seok Jin's pick, number 2?)

369
00:12:28,884 --> 00:12:32,300
(Or perhaps, is it number 3?)

370
00:12:33,295 --> 00:12:34,523
It's number two.

371
00:12:34,524 --> 00:12:36,263
(Number 2 is the answer.)

372
00:12:36,264 --> 00:12:38,969
(Seok Jin wins.)

373
00:12:39,734 --> 00:12:42,464
(Number 1 was a real fox.)

374
00:12:42,465 --> 00:12:45,103
(And so was number 3.)

375
00:12:45,104 --> 00:12:47,503
Fox, please come on out.

376
00:12:47,504 --> 00:12:48,979
(Her identity will be revealed.)

377
00:12:49,045 --> 00:12:50,314
- Who is it? - Who could it be?

378
00:12:50,315 --> 00:12:51,773
(Who is the woman who could mimic a fox so well?)

379
00:12:51,774 --> 00:12:53,013
- Who is it? - Who is it?

380
00:12:53,014 --> 00:12:54,883
(What's the identity of this woman...)

381
00:12:54,884 --> 00:12:58,329
(who wanted a pushover as her partner?)

382
00:12:59,254 --> 00:13:01,023
- Hello. - Hey, Han Na.

383
00:13:01,024 --> 00:13:02,300
Han Na.

384
00:13:04,494 --> 00:13:06,324
(She has conquered the screens...)

385
00:13:06,325 --> 00:13:09,569
(with her amazing acting skills and beauty.)

386
00:13:09,825 --> 00:13:12,763
(She has shown her funny side on the show once.)

387
00:13:12,764 --> 00:13:13,763
(Acting cute)

388
00:13:13,764 --> 00:13:15,503
(You must be...)

389
00:13:15,504 --> 00:13:18,074
(terrible at problem-solving.)

390
00:13:18,075 --> 00:13:21,079
(The talkative lady is back.)

391
00:13:21,305 --> 00:13:23,103
(Crying)

392
00:13:23,104 --> 00:13:25,143
(She did her best to mimic a fox.)

393
00:13:25,144 --> 00:13:27,383
- Han Na. - Han Na.

394
00:13:27,384 --> 00:13:29,660
- Why didn't you pick us? - Han Na.

395
00:13:29,784 --> 00:13:33,113
None of you picked me back then...

396
00:13:33,114 --> 00:13:35,359
when I acted all cute.

397
00:13:35,624 --> 00:13:37,054
My goodness.

398
00:13:37,055 --> 00:13:38,893
- I was waiting for you. - Hey.

399
00:13:38,894 --> 00:13:40,664
It's Han Na and the weak man.

400
00:13:40,665 --> 00:13:42,099
Hello.

401
00:13:42,394 --> 00:13:44,140
It's been a year.

402
00:13:44,864 --> 00:13:46,733
Next up is the rabbit.

403
00:13:46,734 --> 00:13:47,934
Right.

404
00:13:47,935 --> 00:13:49,003
I'm not sure about this one.

405
00:13:49,004 --> 00:13:50,934
- Doesn't it sound like So Min? - It does.

406
00:13:50,935 --> 00:13:52,373
I think it's one of the members.

407
00:13:52,374 --> 00:13:53,773
From the way we see it,

408
00:13:53,774 --> 00:13:55,074
- it's So Min. - If this isn't So Min,

409
00:13:55,075 --> 00:13:56,544
then it'll be tricky.

410
00:13:56,545 --> 00:13:58,214
- I think it's her. - I'm not sure about this one.

411
00:13:58,215 --> 00:13:59,243
I think it's her.

412
00:13:59,244 --> 00:14:01,283
Please talk to us.

413
00:14:01,284 --> 00:14:02,383
Okay.

414
00:14:02,384 --> 00:14:05,290
- I want a handsome partner. - Darn it.

415
00:14:06,284 --> 00:14:08,684
(The moment she talked...)

416
00:14:08,685 --> 00:14:10,099
Then it's me.

417
00:14:10,254 --> 00:14:11,753
Come on.

418
00:14:11,754 --> 00:14:13,964
- That's me. - Don't be ridiculous.

419
00:14:13,965 --> 00:14:15,224
- Come out. - Only three are allowed.

420
00:14:15,225 --> 00:14:16,863
- You want a handsome partner? - Hey.

421
00:14:16,864 --> 00:14:18,594
- Get out. - Okay.

422
00:14:18,595 --> 00:14:20,664
- Det. Lee, leave. - Why would you call me that?

423
00:14:20,665 --> 00:14:23,233
- She wants a handsome partner. - Jae Seok needs to leave.

424
00:14:23,234 --> 00:14:24,503
Get out.

425
00:14:24,504 --> 00:14:25,834
She wants a handsome partner.

426
00:14:25,835 --> 00:14:28,079
Are any of us handsome?

427
00:14:28,175 --> 00:14:30,890
- It's Jae Seok, Se Chan, and Haha. - What do you say?

428
00:14:31,415 --> 00:14:33,914
Except for one, the rest aren't handsome.

429
00:14:33,915 --> 00:14:36,520
(Except for one, the rest aren't handsome.)

430
00:14:37,415 --> 00:14:38,684
And who is that?

431
00:14:38,685 --> 00:14:39,783
(Who is that handsome guy?)

432
00:14:39,784 --> 00:14:42,824
Haha.

433
00:14:42,825 --> 00:14:44,324
(Yes)

434
00:14:44,325 --> 00:14:45,353
Go back.

435
00:14:45,354 --> 00:14:47,294
This must be So Min.

436
00:14:47,295 --> 00:14:49,564
Go back. This isn't right.

437
00:14:49,565 --> 00:14:50,633
Did you hear her?

438
00:14:50,634 --> 00:14:52,393
He's loving it. It was So Min.

439
00:14:52,394 --> 00:14:54,263
Get in line from the handsomest to the ugliest.

440
00:14:54,264 --> 00:14:56,010
This is frustrating.

441
00:14:56,604 --> 00:14:59,979
I'm in first place.

442
00:15:00,604 --> 00:15:01,873
- I'm in 1st place. - He's in 1st place.

443
00:15:01,874 --> 00:15:02,903
- Get in order. - I'm in first place.

444
00:15:02,904 --> 00:15:04,574
- What? - I'm in first place, Se Chan.

445
00:15:04,575 --> 00:15:06,273
- Really? Okay. - Yes.

446
00:15:06,274 --> 00:15:08,883
Here are some rabbit sounds. Here's number one.

447
00:15:08,884 --> 00:15:10,253
Number one, rabbit.

448
00:15:10,254 --> 00:15:12,753
(1st rabbit sound)

449
00:15:12,754 --> 00:15:14,753
- This is... - This is definitely a rabbit.

450
00:15:14,754 --> 00:15:16,424
Do rabbits make that sound?

451
00:15:16,425 --> 00:15:17,670
Do they?

452
00:15:17,854 --> 00:15:19,594
A human can't mimic that.

453
00:15:19,595 --> 00:15:21,363
Here's number two.

454
00:15:21,364 --> 00:15:22,863
(2nd rabbit sound)

455
00:15:22,864 --> 00:15:27,979
(Crying)

456
00:15:28,665 --> 00:15:29,880
I'm not sure.

457
00:15:30,104 --> 00:15:32,174
Here's number three.

458
00:15:32,175 --> 00:15:33,704
(3rd rabbit sound)

459
00:15:33,705 --> 00:15:35,273
I have no idea.

460
00:15:35,274 --> 00:15:37,743
(Whining)

461
00:15:37,744 --> 00:15:39,613
- Isn't this a dog? - Isn't this a dog?

462
00:15:39,614 --> 00:15:40,914
It's when you accidentally step on their tail.

463
00:15:40,915 --> 00:15:42,243
(It's similar to when you step on its tail.)

464
00:15:42,244 --> 00:15:43,544
I have no idea.

465
00:15:43,545 --> 00:15:44,814
- This is hard. - I have no idea.

466
00:15:44,815 --> 00:15:45,883
(It's difficult to differentiate them.)

467
00:15:45,884 --> 00:15:47,783
- She's good. - Is it number two?

468
00:15:47,784 --> 00:15:49,130
They all sound like animals.

469
00:15:49,185 --> 00:15:50,969
- I have no idea. - I think it's number three.

470
00:15:51,024 --> 00:15:52,123
- Number three? - Yes.

471
00:15:52,124 --> 00:15:53,229
I pick number two.

472
00:15:53,295 --> 00:15:54,939
- Then I pick number one. - Are you sure?

473
00:15:55,565 --> 00:15:57,763
Okay, the answer is...

474
00:15:57,764 --> 00:15:59,510
(Which one was So Min?)

475
00:16:00,134 --> 00:16:01,334
Number three.

476
00:16:01,335 --> 00:16:02,804
(Number 3 is the answer.)

477
00:16:02,805 --> 00:16:04,650
(Haha gets it right.)

478
00:16:04,904 --> 00:16:07,503
(It's the desperate cry for love.)

479
00:16:07,504 --> 00:16:10,150
(Giggling)

480
00:16:10,475 --> 00:16:13,719
(Pick... Pick me.)

481
00:16:14,284 --> 00:16:16,714
I think she'll get along with me pretty well.

482
00:16:16,715 --> 00:16:18,490
That was good.

483
00:16:18,555 --> 00:16:19,959
It's So Min.

484
00:16:20,685 --> 00:16:21,983
It's So Min.

485
00:16:21,984 --> 00:16:23,770
- It was So Min. - See?

486
00:16:24,854 --> 00:16:26,694
(Ta-da)

487
00:16:26,695 --> 00:16:27,924
It was So Min.

488
00:16:27,925 --> 00:16:28,924
(Hopping)

489
00:16:28,925 --> 00:16:30,910
- You did well. - Right.

490
00:16:31,065 --> 00:16:32,633
How could you make that sound?

491
00:16:32,634 --> 00:16:34,464
Hey, why didn't you get in line?

492
00:16:34,465 --> 00:16:35,464
- I did. - He did.

493
00:16:35,465 --> 00:16:36,633
Hey, why didn't you get in line?

494
00:16:36,634 --> 00:16:38,273
(She leaves Haha.)

495
00:16:38,274 --> 00:16:39,633
Then why couldn't you get it right?

496
00:16:39,634 --> 00:16:41,344
- I thought it was number two. - It was intentional.

497
00:16:41,345 --> 00:16:43,020
What does this make of Haha?

498
00:16:43,305 --> 00:16:45,273
(What does this make of Haha?)

499
00:16:45,274 --> 00:16:47,344
You greeted him.

500
00:16:47,345 --> 00:16:49,290
- Oh, no. - Poor him.

501
00:16:49,715 --> 00:16:51,459
They look great together.

502
00:16:51,484 --> 00:16:52,613
- He's a rabbit. - Be quiet.

503
00:16:52,614 --> 00:16:55,130
- He looks like a rabbit. - Hop.

504
00:16:55,685 --> 00:16:56,929
It's a rabbit.

505
00:16:57,624 --> 00:16:59,929
So Min is hilarious.

506
00:16:59,955 --> 00:17:02,263
- I'm going to pick the pig. - Me too.

507
00:17:02,264 --> 00:17:03,324
We must.

508
00:17:03,325 --> 00:17:04,763
- I'll go. - Kwang Soo.

509
00:17:04,764 --> 00:17:07,064
- You should go. - I don't think it's Ji Hyo.

510
00:17:07,065 --> 00:17:09,503
- Right. I think she's the bear. - Right.

511
00:17:09,504 --> 00:17:11,303
It'll be easy to differentiate the pig sounds.

512
00:17:11,304 --> 00:17:12,604
Right, it'll be easy.

513
00:17:12,605 --> 00:17:13,704
(They anticipate to become a couple.)

514
00:17:13,705 --> 00:17:15,419
- Ms. Pig. - Yes?

515
00:17:15,504 --> 00:17:19,919
Currently, Se Chan, Jong Kook, and Kwang Soo are in line.

516
00:17:20,014 --> 00:17:21,684
Thank you.

517
00:17:21,685 --> 00:17:24,513
Which one of us would you like to exempt?

518
00:17:24,514 --> 00:17:26,059
Is there one?

519
00:17:26,655 --> 00:17:27,654
(Thinking)

520
00:17:27,655 --> 00:17:31,753
Kwang Soo...

521
00:17:31,754 --> 00:17:33,023
Me?

522
00:17:33,024 --> 00:17:34,724
- Kwang Soo? - Jae Seok, come here.

523
00:17:34,725 --> 00:17:36,124
- Why me? - Get out.

524
00:17:36,125 --> 00:17:37,364
- We'll take him out. - Get out.

525
00:17:37,365 --> 00:17:38,664
- Kwang Soo is out. - Get out.

526
00:17:38,665 --> 00:17:40,033
- Leave. - Okay.

527
00:17:40,034 --> 00:17:41,763
I think she watched "Tazza: One-Eyed Jacks".

528
00:17:41,764 --> 00:17:43,263
What do you mean?

529
00:17:43,264 --> 00:17:45,604
- That was a long time ago. - Really?

530
00:17:45,605 --> 00:17:46,803
I think she watched it.

531
00:17:46,804 --> 00:17:48,073
She saw his back.

532
00:17:48,074 --> 00:17:49,374
She saw Kwang Soo's back.

533
00:17:49,375 --> 00:17:51,243
- I watched it. - See?

534
00:17:51,244 --> 00:17:53,273
(I watched it.)

535
00:17:53,274 --> 00:17:55,444
(Irritated)

536
00:17:55,445 --> 00:17:56,813
She watched it.

537
00:17:56,814 --> 00:17:58,730
Kwang Soo, she saw it.

538
00:17:58,754 --> 00:18:00,253
- Get lost. - Get lost.

539
00:18:00,254 --> 00:18:01,523
Det. Lee, get lost!

540
00:18:01,524 --> 00:18:02,983
- Det. Lee, get lost. - Okay.

541
00:18:02,984 --> 00:18:04,793
- My gosh. - She witnessed his bare back.

542
00:18:04,794 --> 00:18:07,493
Here come the pig sounds. Let's start with number one.

543
00:18:07,494 --> 00:18:09,194
Please play it.

544
00:18:09,195 --> 00:18:12,134
(1st pig sound)

545
00:18:12,135 --> 00:18:13,669
- This is a real pig. - You're right.

546
00:18:14,264 --> 00:18:16,704
- This sounds pretty real. - This is real.

547
00:18:16,705 --> 00:18:18,674
If this is actually her,

548
00:18:18,675 --> 00:18:19,904
- That'd be awesome. - I'll give her my respect.

549
00:18:19,905 --> 00:18:21,303
- Right. - That would be awesome.

550
00:18:21,304 --> 00:18:24,619
- That would be amazing. - This really sounds like a pig.

551
00:18:24,915 --> 00:18:27,884
(2nd pig sound)

552
00:18:27,885 --> 00:18:29,483
(Focused)

553
00:18:29,484 --> 00:18:31,159
Isn't this a snoring sound?

554
00:18:33,685 --> 00:18:35,329
I have no idea. I'm in trouble.

555
00:18:35,725 --> 00:18:38,030
I'm in trouble. I'm becoming anxious.

556
00:18:38,895 --> 00:18:41,293
(3rd pig sound)

557
00:18:41,294 --> 00:18:43,364
(Crying)

558
00:18:43,365 --> 00:18:45,440
If this is her, I'll have so much respect for her.

559
00:18:46,365 --> 00:18:47,710
- Which one is it? - Number three is...

560
00:18:48,064 --> 00:18:49,540
It's...

561
00:18:50,004 --> 00:18:51,474
- This is hard. - Hey.

562
00:18:51,475 --> 00:18:52,704
Those who are good can make this sound.

563
00:18:52,705 --> 00:18:53,773
Number three?

564
00:18:53,774 --> 00:18:55,119
This is too hard.

565
00:18:55,175 --> 00:18:56,780
I... I pick number one.

566
00:18:57,415 --> 00:18:59,190
It sounded too artificial.

567
00:18:59,314 --> 00:19:01,043
- I pick number 3. - I pick number 1.

568
00:19:01,044 --> 00:19:02,214
I pick number 2.

569
00:19:02,215 --> 00:19:04,354
- The answer is... - Which one is it?

570
00:19:04,355 --> 00:19:06,790
number two.

571
00:19:07,455 --> 00:19:09,030
I just picked whatever was left.

572
00:19:09,955 --> 00:19:12,854
(Number 1...)

573
00:19:12,855 --> 00:19:15,924
(and number 3 were actual pig sounds.)

574
00:19:15,925 --> 00:19:17,210
She's too good.

575
00:19:17,334 --> 00:19:18,763
It's number two?

576
00:19:18,764 --> 00:19:21,510
If that's true, she must be a pig herself.

577
00:19:22,004 --> 00:19:24,674
- Seriously. - If she isn't, this is impossible.

578
00:19:24,675 --> 00:19:26,474
How is she so good?

579
00:19:26,475 --> 00:19:28,003
We're partners. Who are you?

580
00:19:28,004 --> 00:19:29,273
(Curious)

581
00:19:29,274 --> 00:19:30,843
- Hello. - What?

582
00:19:30,844 --> 00:19:32,073
- Come on out. - Come on out.

583
00:19:32,074 --> 00:19:33,374
You can come out.

584
00:19:33,375 --> 00:19:35,159
I'm dying to know who it is.

585
00:19:35,645 --> 00:19:39,854
(Who is this pig expert?)

586
00:19:39,855 --> 00:19:42,129
- It's HyunA! - Who is it?

587
00:19:43,655 --> 00:19:47,270
(She's the solo queen who's made a comeback with "Flower Shower".)

588
00:19:47,524 --> 00:19:49,323
(She showed her lovely side on this show.)

589
00:19:49,324 --> 00:19:53,069
(The irreplaceable queen is back.)

590
00:19:54,064 --> 00:19:58,033
(Snoring)

591
00:19:58,034 --> 00:19:59,434
(Oinking)

592
00:19:59,435 --> 00:20:02,573
(The lovely pig is HyunA.)

593
00:20:02,574 --> 00:20:04,313
- HyunA! - It's been a long time!

594
00:20:04,314 --> 00:20:05,550
It really has been.

595
00:20:05,574 --> 00:20:08,914
She and I used to be partners.

596
00:20:08,915 --> 00:20:10,119
HyunA.

597
00:20:10,314 --> 00:20:11,790
- Yes? - How did you make that sound?

598
00:20:11,885 --> 00:20:15,553
My dog kept making pig sounds lately.

599
00:20:15,554 --> 00:20:17,124
- So you mimicked him? - Yes.

600
00:20:17,125 --> 00:20:18,124
(She learned it from her dog.)

601
00:20:18,125 --> 00:20:19,194
- Really? - It was really good.

602
00:20:19,195 --> 00:20:20,323
That's amazing.

603
00:20:20,324 --> 00:20:22,364
By the way, why did you exempt Kwang Soo?

604
00:20:22,365 --> 00:20:24,434
- Why? - Why did you?

605
00:20:24,435 --> 00:20:27,940
I really like him.

606
00:20:28,465 --> 00:20:30,233
But I...

607
00:20:30,234 --> 00:20:32,374
(Hesitating)

608
00:20:32,375 --> 00:20:33,773
Is it because you watched "Tazza: One-Eyed Jacks"?

609
00:20:33,774 --> 00:20:35,904
(Is it because you watched "Tazza: One-Eyed Jacks"?)

610
00:20:35,905 --> 00:20:37,273
(Is that true?)

611
00:20:37,274 --> 00:20:38,343
Did she?

612
00:20:38,344 --> 00:20:40,043
- Did she watch it? - Did she?

613
00:20:40,044 --> 00:20:41,944
Next up is the bear.

614
00:20:41,945 --> 00:20:43,214
Would you like to say something?

615
00:20:43,215 --> 00:20:45,013
I hope many of you will come.

616
00:20:45,014 --> 00:20:46,214
That was random.

617
00:20:46,215 --> 00:20:48,384
- That's Ji Hyo. - It's her.

618
00:20:48,385 --> 00:20:50,454
If you want to partner with the bear, come out.

619
00:20:50,455 --> 00:20:51,454
Come on!

620
00:20:51,455 --> 00:20:52,930
(She has a raspy voice.)

621
00:20:53,425 --> 00:20:56,139
"Come on" itself seems outdated.

622
00:20:56,524 --> 00:20:58,309
Come here.

623
00:20:58,494 --> 00:21:01,864
No one stepped forward, so we'll move on.

624
00:21:01,865 --> 00:21:03,303
(The director's official words)

625
00:21:03,304 --> 00:21:05,134
(We'll hold off on Team Bear for now.)

626
00:21:05,135 --> 00:21:06,233
Is it Ms. Tiger then?

627
00:21:06,234 --> 00:21:07,704
- Ms. Tiger is up. Ms. Tiger? - Ms. Tiger.

628
00:21:07,705 --> 00:21:11,343
Hello, guys. I hope someone will step forward.

629
00:21:11,344 --> 00:21:12,914
Speak up on the count of three then.

630
00:21:12,915 --> 00:21:14,583
Step forward if you want to.

631
00:21:14,584 --> 00:21:15,684
One...

632
00:21:15,685 --> 00:21:16,684
(Whoever wants to join her will step forward.)

633
00:21:16,685 --> 00:21:17,684
Two.

634
00:21:17,685 --> 00:21:19,859
Please step forward.

635
00:21:20,385 --> 00:21:23,384
- Three. - What...

636
00:21:23,385 --> 00:21:24,493
(Kwang Soo volunteers?)

637
00:21:24,494 --> 00:21:27,823
- Goodness. - How nice.

638
00:21:27,824 --> 00:21:28,864
He stepped forward.

639
00:21:28,865 --> 00:21:31,063
You still have to guess which one is her.

640
00:21:31,064 --> 00:21:32,593
Don't think about deliberately getting it wrong.

641
00:21:32,594 --> 00:21:35,233
- If I don't answer correctly... - This could be your only chance.

642
00:21:35,234 --> 00:21:37,573
Unfortunately, we won't be teamed up today.

643
00:21:37,574 --> 00:21:39,674
Here we go then.

644
00:21:39,675 --> 00:21:42,503
Please play tiger number one.

645
00:21:42,504 --> 00:21:44,974
(1st tiger sound)

646
00:21:44,975 --> 00:21:46,990
(Focusing)

647
00:21:47,314 --> 00:21:50,290
- This is the real deal. - It's a real tiger.

648
00:21:50,655 --> 00:21:52,460
Here's tiger number two.

649
00:21:55,324 --> 00:21:56,629
No way.

650
00:21:56,655 --> 00:21:58,869
That one seemed too real.

651
00:21:58,955 --> 00:22:00,593
Here's tiger number three.

652
00:22:00,594 --> 00:22:01,593
(3rd tiger sound)

653
00:22:01,594 --> 00:22:03,839
(Growling)

654
00:22:05,494 --> 00:22:07,934
(Growling)

655
00:22:07,935 --> 00:22:08,934
(What...)

656
00:22:08,935 --> 00:22:10,010
Are you kidding me?

657
00:22:10,465 --> 00:22:11,604
(Gook Ju proves it's her for the 2nd time.)

658
00:22:11,605 --> 00:22:13,280
Why growl like that?

659
00:22:13,834 --> 00:22:15,243
It's definitely number three.

660
00:22:15,244 --> 00:22:16,343
This...

661
00:22:16,344 --> 00:22:19,343
If you don't get this right, it'll count as cheating.

662
00:22:19,344 --> 00:22:21,619
You can only get this wrong on purpose.

663
00:22:21,915 --> 00:22:24,790
- The sound... - Anyone can tell it's number three.

664
00:22:25,115 --> 00:22:27,214
She should've at least tried.

665
00:22:27,215 --> 00:22:29,730
How is that different from saying "Growl"?

666
00:22:29,855 --> 00:22:31,954
(Growling)

667
00:22:31,955 --> 00:22:34,424
(She actually did her best.)

668
00:22:34,425 --> 00:22:35,924
(Growling)

669
00:22:35,925 --> 00:22:37,139
So what's the answer?

670
00:22:37,764 --> 00:22:40,904
Say the answer in 1, 2, 3.

671
00:22:40,905 --> 00:22:41,934
(Kwang Soo chooses number 3.)

672
00:22:41,935 --> 00:22:43,480
- Number 3. - Yes, number 3.

673
00:22:43,665 --> 00:22:45,333
Let's see if you're right.

674
00:22:45,334 --> 00:22:47,204
- You could be wrong. - The answer is...

675
00:22:47,205 --> 00:22:48,204
(The answer is...)

676
00:22:48,205 --> 00:22:49,303
- It's number three. - Yes!

677
00:22:49,304 --> 00:22:51,773
(Number 3)

678
00:22:51,774 --> 00:22:53,619
We don't know who it is yet.

679
00:22:54,115 --> 00:22:56,720
- We don't know. - Exactly.

680
00:22:56,784 --> 00:22:57,859
Stop messing with me.

681
00:22:58,484 --> 00:23:01,023
- We don't know yet. - Of course not.

682
00:23:01,024 --> 00:23:03,159
Come on out Ms. Lee.

683
00:23:03,855 --> 00:23:05,230
(Okay!)

684
00:23:05,324 --> 00:23:07,500
(Ta-da!)

685
00:23:07,625 --> 00:23:09,740
It's really hot in there.

686
00:23:10,834 --> 00:23:13,033
(His toenail is rotting.)

687
00:23:13,034 --> 00:23:16,409
(She tells everyone that his toenail is rotting.)

688
00:23:17,504 --> 00:23:19,680
(Tilting)

689
00:23:20,435 --> 00:23:22,444
(The chair went this far into the ground!)

690
00:23:22,445 --> 00:23:25,944
(The two showed great chemistry with their banter.)

691
00:23:25,945 --> 00:23:28,914
I wished it to be anyone else but him.

692
00:23:28,915 --> 00:23:30,483
You're the show's official couple.

693
00:23:30,484 --> 00:23:32,013
- So next up... - It's the snake.

694
00:23:32,014 --> 00:23:33,260
The snake.

695
00:23:33,615 --> 00:23:35,930
(Se Chan and Jong Kook step forward.)

696
00:23:36,554 --> 00:23:37,753
I can't tell.

697
00:23:37,754 --> 00:23:39,629
Here's snake number two.

698
00:23:41,264 --> 00:23:42,763
This one is a person.

699
00:23:42,764 --> 00:23:44,134
Here's snake number three.

700
00:23:44,135 --> 00:23:45,510
That's from a real snake.

701
00:23:45,834 --> 00:23:47,604
- Make up your minds. - I choose number one.

702
00:23:47,605 --> 00:23:48,604
- 1? - You think it's number 2, right?

703
00:23:48,605 --> 00:23:49,803
Then I'll choose number two.

704
00:23:49,804 --> 00:23:50,974
- I choose number one then. - Okay.

705
00:23:50,975 --> 00:23:53,573
The correct answer is number two.

706
00:23:53,574 --> 00:23:54,944
(Number 2)

707
00:23:54,945 --> 00:23:56,444
(Jong Kook guessed right.)

708
00:23:56,445 --> 00:23:58,343
- Really? - No way.

709
00:23:58,344 --> 00:23:59,874
Please come on out.

710
00:23:59,875 --> 00:24:01,720
That last sound...

711
00:24:02,284 --> 00:24:03,283
Who is it?

712
00:24:03,284 --> 00:24:05,990
(Who is the rookie that debuted only 7 months ago?)

713
00:24:07,625 --> 00:24:10,030
(Sihyeon of EVERGLOW)

714
00:24:11,254 --> 00:24:13,124
(Hot rookie EVERGLOW won 1st place...)

715
00:24:13,125 --> 00:24:14,964
(with its debut single "Bon Bon Chocolat".)

716
00:24:14,965 --> 00:24:19,569
(The talented and beautiful Sihyeon is the team's lead vocalist.)

717
00:24:20,435 --> 00:24:21,980
Goodness.

718
00:24:22,705 --> 00:24:25,404
(But...)

719
00:24:25,405 --> 00:24:26,750
I don't know who she is.

720
00:24:27,135 --> 00:24:30,419
(Who is she?)

721
00:24:30,605 --> 00:24:31,843
I don't know who she is.

722
00:24:31,844 --> 00:24:32,914
(To be honest...)

723
00:24:32,915 --> 00:24:34,043
Hello.

724
00:24:34,044 --> 00:24:35,690
(Then her name is shown on a sketchbook.)

725
00:24:36,784 --> 00:24:39,654
She is Sihyeon of EVERGLOW.

726
00:24:39,655 --> 00:24:40,783
- EVERGLOW. - EVERGLOW, right?

727
00:24:40,784 --> 00:24:42,684
- Sihyeon of EVERGLOW. - EVERGLOW.

728
00:24:42,685 --> 00:24:44,970
- EVERGLOW. - EVERGLOW, right?

729
00:24:45,024 --> 00:24:46,424
- What... - EVERGLOW!

730
00:24:46,425 --> 00:24:48,424
She's called Sihyeon because she delivers.

731
00:24:48,425 --> 00:24:50,833
- EVERGLOW. - To be honest,

732
00:24:50,834 --> 00:24:53,233
we don't know much about EVERGLOW, so we apologize.

733
00:24:53,234 --> 00:24:54,864
- It's fine. - Still,

734
00:24:54,865 --> 00:24:57,874
joining us today is Sihyeon...

735
00:24:57,875 --> 00:24:59,033
of EVERGLOW.

736
00:24:59,034 --> 00:25:01,419
And Ji Hyo was the bear like we expected.

737
00:25:02,044 --> 00:25:03,144
(The Pair-up)

738
00:25:03,145 --> 00:25:05,849
(Team Fox, Team Rabbit, Team Pig, Team Bear, Team Tiger, Team Snake)

739
00:25:06,175 --> 00:25:09,559
Let's give it up for everyone who's joining us.

740
00:25:09,844 --> 00:25:11,654
- Thank you. - I wanted to be here.

741
00:25:11,655 --> 00:25:13,053
- Thank you. - Well,

742
00:25:13,054 --> 00:25:16,184
- Han Na is like... - She's like family to us.

743
00:25:16,185 --> 00:25:17,694
- I've been dying to be back. - Right.

744
00:25:17,695 --> 00:25:20,924
Han Na has been quite active in several TV and variety shows...

745
00:25:20,925 --> 00:25:21,964
while she was away.

746
00:25:21,965 --> 00:25:24,434
- Not now though. - No?

747
00:25:24,435 --> 00:25:26,763
- Yes, I've been resting at home. - I see.

748
00:25:26,764 --> 00:25:28,704
What do you do in your free time then?

749
00:25:28,705 --> 00:25:31,573
I mostly just lie down.

750
00:25:31,574 --> 00:25:33,134
- I love it. - I like that answer.

751
00:25:33,135 --> 00:25:36,879
I've been lying down so much that I should buy a special pillow.

752
00:25:37,105 --> 00:25:38,874
- My neck's stiff. - Nice one.

753
00:25:38,875 --> 00:25:40,214
- It's good. - She's one of us.

754
00:25:40,215 --> 00:25:41,944
- I love what you just said. - A special pillow.

755
00:25:41,945 --> 00:25:44,119
This could lead to a TV commercial.

756
00:25:44,314 --> 00:25:46,914
Kang Han Na's pillow for the spine.

757
00:25:46,915 --> 00:25:48,224
Isn't it great?

758
00:25:48,225 --> 00:25:49,823
- For the spine. - The spine.

759
00:25:49,824 --> 00:25:51,793
Han Na can deliver in every way.

760
00:25:51,794 --> 00:25:54,023
An actress promoting a special pillow for the spine?

761
00:25:54,024 --> 00:25:55,823
- Why not? - It's a bit weird.

762
00:25:55,824 --> 00:25:57,694
What's the issue? Han Na, would you...

763
00:25:57,695 --> 00:25:59,233
- accept the TV commercial? - Of course.

764
00:25:59,234 --> 00:26:00,233
(Must you ask?)

765
00:26:00,234 --> 00:26:02,233
(She doesn't hesitate to take the bait.)

766
00:26:02,234 --> 00:26:04,934
- I like how passionate you are. - She's definitely one of us.

767
00:26:04,935 --> 00:26:06,404
I'd love to be in that commercial.

768
00:26:06,405 --> 00:26:09,043
In an old interview,

769
00:26:09,044 --> 00:26:12,543
you once said that you'd love to be married by 32.

770
00:26:12,544 --> 00:26:15,184
How's that plan coming along?

771
00:26:15,185 --> 00:26:17,813
The last time I was on the show...

772
00:26:17,814 --> 00:26:19,313
- was last year. - Right.

773
00:26:19,314 --> 00:26:21,724
- I experienced a breakup. - Really?

774
00:26:21,725 --> 00:26:23,323
(I experienced a breakup.)

775
00:26:23,324 --> 00:26:25,424
- Oh, really? - So I...

776
00:26:25,425 --> 00:26:26,724
There's a reason why you stayed in bed.

777
00:26:26,725 --> 00:26:28,424
- Aren't my eyes misty? - Yes.

778
00:26:28,425 --> 00:26:30,823
- They are. - You had a reason.

779
00:26:30,824 --> 00:26:32,964
- That's right. - You'll now meet your last love.

780
00:26:32,965 --> 00:26:35,434
- Really? Thanks for saying so. - And you can marry next year.

781
00:26:35,435 --> 00:26:36,964
- That's nice of you to say. - I think...

782
00:26:36,965 --> 00:26:38,733
you'll experience one more breakup first.

783
00:26:38,734 --> 00:26:39,733
(What?)

784
00:26:39,734 --> 00:26:41,543
She's the expert on relationships.

785
00:26:41,544 --> 00:26:44,674
Have you become a shaman lately?

786
00:26:44,675 --> 00:26:46,243
(Shaman So Min is the expert on love.)

787
00:26:46,244 --> 00:26:49,543
Anyway, Han Na experienced an unexpected...

788
00:26:49,544 --> 00:26:51,614
- breakup. - An unexpected one?

789
00:26:51,615 --> 00:26:54,424
She's been having a hard time,

790
00:26:54,425 --> 00:26:55,924
so let's cheer her up.

791
00:26:55,925 --> 00:26:58,053
You can love again!

792
00:26:58,054 --> 00:26:59,194
(Don't cry!)

793
00:26:59,195 --> 00:27:00,694
- Good luck. - Thanks.

794
00:27:00,695 --> 00:27:04,333
At times like this, we should stick together, right?

795
00:27:04,334 --> 00:27:07,134
We should all help her bounce back from the heartache.

796
00:27:07,135 --> 00:27:09,404
- But... - Let's all tell her a way...

797
00:27:09,405 --> 00:27:10,464
to get over a breakup.

798
00:27:10,465 --> 00:27:12,033
It's been a while since I've gotten over it.

799
00:27:12,034 --> 00:27:13,733
It's fine. Just let us help you.

800
00:27:13,734 --> 00:27:15,303
- You haven't moved on. - I have.

801
00:27:15,304 --> 00:27:17,073
- No, you haven't. - Your eyes are misty.

802
00:27:17,074 --> 00:27:19,543
Jae Seok's making it worse. He's blowing it out of proportion.

803
00:27:19,544 --> 00:27:21,714
- Han Na said she's fine. - I've moved on.

804
00:27:21,715 --> 00:27:23,483
- Let's bring her out. - He said to bring her out.

805
00:27:23,484 --> 00:27:26,654
- Han Na, let us help you. - Hear us out first.

806
00:27:26,655 --> 00:27:28,854
- Han Na, come on. - You're still hurting.

807
00:27:28,855 --> 00:27:30,323
No, I'm not.

808
00:27:30,324 --> 00:27:31,323
- It's all right. - I've moved on.

809
00:27:31,324 --> 00:27:33,023
- The pain is still there. - Hold on.

810
00:27:33,024 --> 00:27:34,694
You just don't know it.

811
00:27:34,695 --> 00:27:36,293
Everyone tells me I look great.

812
00:27:36,294 --> 00:27:38,134
- You're not all right. - But I am.

813
00:27:38,135 --> 00:27:39,563
- Jong Kook. - Yes?

814
00:27:39,564 --> 00:27:42,503
Is there a nice song to listen to after a breakup?

815
00:27:42,504 --> 00:27:43,634
- After a breakup? - Yes.

816
00:27:43,635 --> 00:27:45,803
It's better to work out.

817
00:27:45,804 --> 00:27:47,579
He's always heartless.

818
00:27:47,844 --> 00:27:50,874
When I experienced a breakup,

819
00:27:50,875 --> 00:27:52,690
I ran up the apartment staircase.

820
00:27:53,615 --> 00:27:55,944
(Right after a breakup)

821
00:27:55,945 --> 00:27:57,583
Really?

822
00:27:57,584 --> 00:28:00,414
- Really? - I immediately ran up the stairs.

823
00:28:00,415 --> 00:28:02,224
- So after a breakup... - Exercise.

824
00:28:02,225 --> 00:28:03,323
- you run up the stairs. - Exactly.

825
00:28:03,324 --> 00:28:07,124
- Sihyeon, what about you? - I guess I'd go on a trip.

826
00:28:07,125 --> 00:28:09,694
- Have you experienced a breakup? - Is it safe to mention this?

827
00:28:09,695 --> 00:28:10,839
(Is it safe to mention this?)

828
00:28:10,994 --> 00:28:13,664
I haven't been on a trip before though.

829
00:28:13,665 --> 00:28:16,303
(She suddenly put on the brakes.)

830
00:28:16,304 --> 00:28:17,704
- There's a manual. - You haven't been on a trip?

831
00:28:17,705 --> 00:28:19,503
She follows the manual to get out of it.

832
00:28:19,504 --> 00:28:21,503
- It's freaky if you ask me. - She got out of there.

833
00:28:21,504 --> 00:28:23,204
- She made a U-turn. - I've never...

834
00:28:23,205 --> 00:28:24,243
- been on a trip before. - The manual...

835
00:28:24,244 --> 00:28:25,974
- So that's what you'd do? - Dating...

836
00:28:25,975 --> 00:28:29,659
Let's say you just broke up. Where would you go?

837
00:28:30,215 --> 00:28:31,859
- The Czech Republic - The Czech Republic?

838
00:28:33,715 --> 00:28:34,783
Did you experience a breakup?

839
00:28:34,784 --> 00:28:36,224
You must've broken up with someone!

840
00:28:36,225 --> 00:28:37,384
Of course not.

841
00:28:37,385 --> 00:28:39,053
He must've broken up with someone.

842
00:28:39,054 --> 00:28:40,523
My wife allowed it.

843
00:28:40,524 --> 00:28:44,300
Seok Jin, it's been a while since you've broken up with someone.

844
00:28:44,764 --> 00:28:46,109
Well...

845
00:28:46,135 --> 00:28:47,934
What I'd like to say is this.

846
00:28:47,935 --> 00:28:50,280
Is this your image now?

847
00:28:50,405 --> 00:28:54,050
Are you sure you're okay with this image?

848
00:28:54,774 --> 00:28:57,843
You used to stay home for three days in a row drinking.

849
00:28:57,844 --> 00:28:59,174
- That was a long time ago. - With snacks...

850
00:28:59,175 --> 00:29:01,013
- Did that really happen? - Back in the day.

851
00:29:01,014 --> 00:29:02,644
- That's right. - Is that so?

852
00:29:02,645 --> 00:29:04,214
- How much did you drink? - What?

853
00:29:04,215 --> 00:29:06,030
- How many bottles of soju? - One and a half.

854
00:29:06,415 --> 00:29:07,629
For three days?

855
00:29:08,524 --> 00:29:09,753
For three days...

856
00:29:09,754 --> 00:29:11,924
- So in a day... - A bottle and a half each day.

857
00:29:11,925 --> 00:29:14,793
Were you drinking it like cough syrup?

858
00:29:14,794 --> 00:29:15,823
What was that?

859
00:29:15,824 --> 00:29:17,793
- Cough syrup? - You drink small portions of it.

860
00:29:17,794 --> 00:29:19,233
He doesn't have the best alcohol tolerance.

861
00:29:19,234 --> 00:29:20,934
Half a bottle a day...

862
00:29:20,935 --> 00:29:23,233
I've moved on, so there's no need to...

863
00:29:23,234 --> 00:29:24,934
- Just stay still. - It's all right.

864
00:29:24,935 --> 00:29:27,604
- You don't have to say anything. - You just don't know it.

865
00:29:27,605 --> 00:29:28,974
- Listen to your elders. - You're hurting!

866
00:29:28,975 --> 00:29:30,444
- Han Na. - Yes?

867
00:29:30,445 --> 00:29:32,714
Just stay still for the sake of the show.

868
00:29:32,715 --> 00:29:34,743
- I don't want it to last long. - Let us talk.

869
00:29:34,744 --> 00:29:36,184
- Please help me. - HyunA.

870
00:29:36,185 --> 00:29:38,414
- Yes? - I know it's not appropriate,

871
00:29:38,415 --> 00:29:40,730
- but what do you think? - Well,

872
00:29:40,814 --> 00:29:42,200
I'm happy right now.

873
00:29:42,824 --> 00:29:44,829
Right, she's in a happy relationship.

874
00:29:45,054 --> 00:29:47,169
- She's in love. - She doesn't need to consider it.

875
00:29:47,625 --> 00:29:49,493
I've never thought about it.

876
00:29:49,494 --> 00:29:51,793
- So we'll move on. - Right.

877
00:29:51,794 --> 00:29:52,964
- Gook Ju. - Yes?

878
00:29:52,965 --> 00:29:55,634
- What do you think? - I'm saying this...

879
00:29:55,635 --> 00:29:57,763
- Keep it honest. - for Han Na and not for fun.

880
00:29:57,764 --> 00:30:00,280
You should have fun like a piece of trash.

881
00:30:01,074 --> 00:30:02,773
- Right? - Have fun like a piece of trash.

882
00:30:02,774 --> 00:30:04,144
(What?)

883
00:30:04,145 --> 00:30:06,614
- Wait. - Do what you wouldn't do.

884
00:30:06,615 --> 00:30:08,384
- Come on. - You have a dirty mouth.

885
00:30:08,385 --> 00:30:10,214
A person is hurting right now.

886
00:30:10,215 --> 00:30:12,184
- "Have fun like a piece of trash"? - Go to Itaewon...

887
00:30:12,185 --> 00:30:14,214
and be like this all the time.

888
00:30:14,215 --> 00:30:17,023
(Go to Itaewon and be like this all the time.)

889
00:30:17,024 --> 00:30:19,053
What are you doing though?

890
00:30:19,054 --> 00:30:20,424
(Ex-boyfriend, goodbye.)

891
00:30:20,425 --> 00:30:21,493
At a club?

892
00:30:21,494 --> 00:30:22,724
(I'm getting drunk tonight.)

893
00:30:22,725 --> 00:30:25,194
Gook Ju, you're the best.

894
00:30:25,195 --> 00:30:27,293
Gook Ju, why are you covering your face?

895
00:30:27,294 --> 00:30:29,333
It's the side that's covered in tears.

896
00:30:29,334 --> 00:30:31,833
You leave one side uncovered for a new encounter.

897
00:30:31,834 --> 00:30:34,409
The other side is for your tears.

898
00:30:35,304 --> 00:30:36,803
That's realistic advice.

899
00:30:36,804 --> 00:30:39,250
If you start wailing, turn around.

900
00:30:39,645 --> 00:30:41,190
It's realistic advice though.

901
00:30:41,615 --> 00:30:43,444
Even though she's supposed to be sad,

902
00:30:43,445 --> 00:30:45,829
I thought that getting stomped by her would kill me.

903
00:30:46,115 --> 00:30:49,359
Just imagine her stepping on your toes.

904
00:30:49,425 --> 00:30:51,023
You'd die.

905
00:30:51,024 --> 00:30:52,424
It was a piece of realistic advice.

906
00:30:52,425 --> 00:30:54,093
She needs realistic advice like this.

907
00:30:54,094 --> 00:30:56,440
- It was very realistic. - She should dance and have fun.

908
00:30:56,465 --> 00:30:58,793
Det. Lee, tell us what you think.

909
00:30:58,794 --> 00:30:59,793
- I think... - Is he a detective?

910
00:30:59,794 --> 00:31:01,634
she should have many conversations with people around her.

911
00:31:01,635 --> 00:31:03,180
Boo!

912
00:31:03,935 --> 00:31:06,003
(That's boring.)

913
00:31:06,004 --> 00:31:07,303
(Han Na joins.)

914
00:31:07,304 --> 00:31:08,919
- Jo Kka Chi. - What?

915
00:31:10,274 --> 00:31:11,513
(Everyone is shocked.)

916
00:31:11,514 --> 00:31:13,649
The name of his character is Jo Kka Chi.

917
00:31:14,074 --> 00:31:15,659
- Gosh. - Gosh.

918
00:31:15,784 --> 00:31:17,283
The name of his character is Jo Kka Chi.

919
00:31:17,284 --> 00:31:18,530
(It's the character Kwang Soo plays in "Tazza: One-Eyed Jacks".)

920
00:31:18,715 --> 00:31:20,654
(It should be pronounced carefully.)

921
00:31:20,655 --> 00:31:22,700
- I was shocked. - I was shocked too.

922
00:31:22,725 --> 00:31:24,523
I was shocked that everyone was shocked.

923
00:31:24,524 --> 00:31:26,194
- Goodness. - That's right.

924
00:31:26,195 --> 00:31:27,970
- Gosh. - I play Kka Chi.

925
00:31:28,125 --> 00:31:30,493
- You've become a better talker. - I saw it in a theater.

926
00:31:30,494 --> 00:31:32,134
- That's not it. - This is only the beginning.

927
00:31:32,135 --> 00:31:34,394
- She's incredible. - It's the name of his character.

928
00:31:34,395 --> 00:31:36,063
- Se Chan. - Like Gook Ju...

929
00:31:36,064 --> 00:31:39,104
Do you have a bit of dating experience?

930
00:31:39,105 --> 00:31:40,809
What kind of question is that?

931
00:31:41,034 --> 00:31:42,680
- I do have a bit of experience. - Really?

932
00:31:42,875 --> 00:31:44,003
How do you get over a breakup?

933
00:31:44,004 --> 00:31:46,374
I gather friends...

934
00:31:46,375 --> 00:31:48,384
- and go to a club. - That's good.

935
00:31:48,385 --> 00:31:50,184
- Just like Gook Ju. - Let's do it together.

936
00:31:50,185 --> 00:31:51,954
But I'm a bit different.

937
00:31:51,955 --> 00:31:54,313
"I'll find another girl!"

938
00:31:54,314 --> 00:31:56,283
Because there are guys like him,

939
00:31:56,284 --> 00:31:58,230
- I should do this. - It's Lee Gook Ju!

940
00:31:58,294 --> 00:32:01,399
- Since he wants a new start... - It's Lee Gook Ju!

941
00:32:01,695 --> 00:32:03,164
Wait!

942
00:32:03,165 --> 00:32:05,464
(A new love starts after a breakup.)

943
00:32:05,465 --> 00:32:06,934
- What is this? - Wait!

944
00:32:06,935 --> 00:32:08,404
Two heartbroken people shouldn't meet.

945
00:32:08,405 --> 00:32:09,434
All right.

946
00:32:09,435 --> 00:32:13,450
That was Han Na's breakup story.

947
00:32:13,605 --> 00:32:15,773
Han Na, you can get over it!

948
00:32:15,774 --> 00:32:17,104
- Get over it! - You're strong!

949
00:32:17,105 --> 00:32:18,273
- You're strong! - You can get over it!

950
00:32:18,274 --> 00:32:19,849
Find new love!

951
00:32:20,375 --> 00:32:22,190
I hope you'll find a new relationship.

952
00:32:22,215 --> 00:32:24,543
- Thank you. - You'll be thankful someday.

953
00:32:24,544 --> 00:32:26,013
- Han Na, smile! - Thank you.

954
00:32:26,014 --> 00:32:29,059
Following Han Na,

955
00:32:29,225 --> 00:32:30,659
let's talk to HyunA.

956
00:32:31,155 --> 00:32:32,899
It's been so long.

957
00:32:33,054 --> 00:32:34,354
She recently released...

958
00:32:34,355 --> 00:32:36,069
a new song.

959
00:32:36,294 --> 00:32:38,440
- "Flower Shower". - We've been waiting for it.

960
00:32:38,465 --> 00:32:40,364
The title is so pretty.

961
00:32:40,365 --> 00:32:41,833
Before anything else,

962
00:32:41,834 --> 00:32:45,033
- let's see her performance. - I can't wait.

963
00:32:45,034 --> 00:32:46,934
- Let's see "Flower Shower". - Okay!

964
00:32:46,935 --> 00:32:48,073
"Flower Shower".

965
00:32:48,074 --> 00:32:50,174
Is that why you're wearing a floral-print jacket?

966
00:32:50,175 --> 00:32:52,089
(It suits the title of her song.)

967
00:32:52,615 --> 00:32:55,359
(She throws her headband off and gets ready to dance.)

968
00:33:00,115 --> 00:33:01,559
(She looks completely different.)

969
00:33:02,685 --> 00:33:03,930
That's so cool.

970
00:33:04,584 --> 00:33:05,954
She looks like a different person when she dances.

971
00:33:05,955 --> 00:33:08,030
She becomes a completely different person.

972
00:33:14,494 --> 00:33:16,139
I wish I could dance like her.

973
00:33:16,804 --> 00:33:17,964
(Lame imitation 1)

974
00:33:17,965 --> 00:33:19,309
(Lame imitation 2)

975
00:33:20,475 --> 00:33:21,619
We can never dance like her.

976
00:33:21,804 --> 00:33:23,149
I wish I could.

977
00:33:24,145 --> 00:33:25,374
HyunA is incredible.

978
00:33:25,375 --> 00:33:26,550
She's different.

979
00:33:27,014 --> 00:33:29,619
You're an amazing dancer.

980
00:33:29,715 --> 00:33:32,414
Actually, Gook Ju has covered...

981
00:33:32,415 --> 00:33:35,354
many of HyunA's songs including "Red".

982
00:33:35,355 --> 00:33:38,093
I might have danced to "Red" more times than HyunA has.

983
00:33:38,094 --> 00:33:40,930
Let's see "Red".

984
00:33:40,955 --> 00:33:43,063
- I'll dance to "Babe". - "Babe".

985
00:33:43,064 --> 00:33:44,664
I'm trying to take this song away from her too.

986
00:33:44,665 --> 00:33:45,869
Don't lose it to her.

987
00:33:46,034 --> 00:33:47,540
- Don't lose it. - Show us!

988
00:33:47,935 --> 00:33:50,040
Please understand even if my belly is exposed.

989
00:33:51,334 --> 00:33:53,680
- Your belly? - My top is a bit short.

990
00:33:54,074 --> 00:33:57,819
(The song thief takes the lead from the beginning.)

991
00:33:58,475 --> 00:34:00,243
HyunA, you should use more of your hips.

992
00:34:00,244 --> 00:34:02,013
(HyunA is surprised at how good Gook Ju is.)

993
00:34:02,014 --> 00:34:04,089
HyunA, you started from the left.

994
00:34:05,054 --> 00:34:07,359
(Gook Ju is confident even next to HyunA.)

995
00:34:07,615 --> 00:34:10,323
- Here it comes. - Gook Ju is lonely.

996
00:34:10,324 --> 00:34:11,669
- She's lonely. - Here it comes.

997
00:34:12,254 --> 00:34:13,694
- Gook Ju. - It's a Jimmy Jib.

998
00:34:13,695 --> 00:34:15,569
Itaewon after a breakup.

999
00:34:17,665 --> 00:34:19,334
(The feminine HyunA dance in the day)

1000
00:34:19,335 --> 00:34:21,934
(The sexy breakup dance at night)

1001
00:34:21,935 --> 00:34:23,180
Itaewon after a breakup.

1002
00:34:23,534 --> 00:34:25,704
(Goodbye, old love. Hello, new love.)

1003
00:34:25,705 --> 00:34:27,810
Come back.

1004
00:34:28,275 --> 00:34:29,604
- That's crazy. - Come back.

1005
00:34:29,605 --> 00:34:31,474
- Okay. - Gook Ju is crazy.

1006
00:34:31,475 --> 00:34:32,774
Gook Ju.

1007
00:34:32,775 --> 00:34:34,919
- That was amazing. - That was incredible.

1008
00:34:35,315 --> 00:34:38,484
By the way, HyunA's boss is PSY.

1009
00:34:38,485 --> 00:34:40,184
- Right. - Her boss is PSY?

1010
00:34:40,185 --> 00:34:41,383
- Yes. - She's at P NATION.

1011
00:34:41,384 --> 00:34:43,060
PSY told me,

1012
00:34:43,085 --> 00:34:44,794
"Please be nice to HyunA."

1013
00:34:44,795 --> 00:34:46,530
"Don't make her talk too much."

1014
00:34:46,594 --> 00:34:47,993
"Just make her dance."

1015
00:34:47,994 --> 00:34:49,569
("Don't make her talk too much. Just make her dance.")

1016
00:34:49,895 --> 00:34:51,763
(Her boss has a clever strategy.)

1017
00:34:51,764 --> 00:34:53,834
HyunA is a good talker, PSY.

1018
00:34:53,835 --> 00:34:55,533
- She is. - She is.

1019
00:34:55,534 --> 00:34:57,164
PSY also said,

1020
00:34:57,165 --> 00:34:58,934
- now that he runs a company, - Right.

1021
00:34:58,935 --> 00:35:00,379
he realizes how difficult it is...

1022
00:35:00,775 --> 00:35:02,620
to negotiate with celebrities.

1023
00:35:03,904 --> 00:35:05,249
He had a bit of difficulty.

1024
00:35:05,514 --> 00:35:06,689
It's hard to negotiate?

1025
00:35:06,844 --> 00:35:07,990
Oh, my.

1026
00:35:08,145 --> 00:35:09,990
PSY said,

1027
00:35:10,085 --> 00:35:11,660
"I'm a celebrity too,"

1028
00:35:12,114 --> 00:35:14,184
"but it's so hard to talk to celebrities."

1029
00:35:14,185 --> 00:35:16,359
It must have been a difficult contract to sign.

1030
00:35:16,384 --> 00:35:18,193
- Be nice to PSY. - Of course.

1031
00:35:18,194 --> 00:35:20,354
- I'll work hard, Boss. - Right.

1032
00:35:20,355 --> 00:35:21,863
- Mr. PSY. - Mr. PSY.

1033
00:35:21,864 --> 00:35:22,963
(PSY's support gives HyunA energy.)

1034
00:35:22,964 --> 00:35:24,640
PSY seems to care a lot about HyunA.

1035
00:35:25,034 --> 00:35:26,963
- I'm scared. - PSY said that.

1036
00:35:26,964 --> 00:35:29,339
- Let's move on to Gook Ju. - Me?

1037
00:35:29,364 --> 00:35:30,863
- I thought we were done. - No.

1038
00:35:30,864 --> 00:35:32,504
- I did this. - We're done.

1039
00:35:32,505 --> 00:35:34,450
- Aren't we done with Goo Ju? - We are.

1040
00:35:34,574 --> 00:35:36,019
- Aren't we done? - We're done.

1041
00:35:36,045 --> 00:35:37,780
- We should talk to her more. - Is there more?

1042
00:35:37,804 --> 00:35:39,649
- Gook Ju. - Yes?

1043
00:35:39,944 --> 00:35:41,644
Thank you for being with us today.

1044
00:35:41,645 --> 00:35:42,959
Pardon? Is that it?

1045
00:35:43,585 --> 00:35:45,883
(He ran out of things to ask Gook Ju.)

1046
00:35:45,884 --> 00:35:46,984
Wait.

1047
00:35:46,985 --> 00:35:48,930
I didn't get to promote anything like HyunA.

1048
00:35:48,955 --> 00:35:50,224
Go, Gook Ju!

1049
00:35:50,225 --> 00:35:51,524
(We root for you!)

1050
00:35:51,525 --> 00:35:53,430
- Let's do this! - What?

1051
00:35:53,795 --> 00:35:55,339
All right.

1052
00:35:55,464 --> 00:35:58,310
Let's move on to Sihyeon.

1053
00:35:59,094 --> 00:36:01,033
- Sihyeon. - Sihyeon.

1054
00:36:01,034 --> 00:36:04,234
EVERGLOW debuted only seven months ago,

1055
00:36:04,235 --> 00:36:05,403
- but Sihyeon... - Yes.

1056
00:36:05,404 --> 00:36:08,803
I did a few survival shows before that.

1057
00:36:08,804 --> 00:36:12,914
You've been on many audition shows.

1058
00:36:12,915 --> 00:36:15,089
Do you have any tips?

1059
00:36:15,915 --> 00:36:18,044
I practiced impressions a lot.

1060
00:36:18,045 --> 00:36:20,883
- Impressions. - I worked on impressions a lot.

1061
00:36:20,884 --> 00:36:22,323
Then let's see it.

1062
00:36:22,324 --> 00:36:24,024
(Sihyeon worked on impressions all night long.)

1063
00:36:24,025 --> 00:36:25,354
(Excited)

1064
00:36:25,355 --> 00:36:27,124
- You need many weapons. - Right.

1065
00:36:27,125 --> 00:36:28,370
Your unique strength.

1066
00:36:28,924 --> 00:36:31,263
- Let me mimic the sound of a siren. - A siren?

1067
00:36:31,264 --> 00:36:34,169
It's how I warm up my voice.

1068
00:36:34,964 --> 00:36:36,410
(Curious)

1069
00:36:37,134 --> 00:36:43,350
(She mimics the sound of a siren.)

1070
00:36:43,875 --> 00:36:48,073
(Only 3 seconds in, and the atmosphere becomes awkward.)

1071
00:36:48,074 --> 00:36:49,959
(What do we do?)

1072
00:36:51,244 --> 00:36:52,314
Thank you.

1073
00:36:52,315 --> 00:36:53,490
Well...

1074
00:36:54,654 --> 00:36:56,930
Is this what she practiced?

1075
00:36:58,025 --> 00:37:00,794
- She's so cute. - You're so nice.

1076
00:37:00,795 --> 00:37:04,394
Sihyeon must have reminded HyunA of the old days.

1077
00:37:04,395 --> 00:37:05,894
- I think she's so cute. - Thank you.

1078
00:37:05,895 --> 00:37:08,033
I used to work so hard on things that won't work too.

1079
00:37:08,034 --> 00:37:10,709
- "Things that won't work"? - What?

1080
00:37:11,065 --> 00:37:13,633
(She said it too straightforwardly.)

1081
00:37:13,634 --> 00:37:15,080
Hey, what?

1082
00:37:15,174 --> 00:37:17,620
(Is this something that won't work?)

1083
00:37:17,975 --> 00:37:19,749
- "Things that won't work"? - She tried so hard.

1084
00:37:19,775 --> 00:37:21,450
- She practiced it all night long. - "Things that won't work"?

1085
00:37:21,815 --> 00:37:23,414
HyunA, "Things that won't work"?

1086
00:37:23,415 --> 00:37:25,560
- You should thank HyunA. - PSY, are you watching?

1087
00:37:25,585 --> 00:37:26,990
HyunA is a good talker.

1088
00:37:27,384 --> 00:37:29,883
- It does feel refreshing. - That was straightforward.

1089
00:37:29,884 --> 00:37:32,354
- HyunA saved Sihyeon's part. - Right.

1090
00:37:32,355 --> 00:37:34,100
PSY, are you watching?

1091
00:37:34,154 --> 00:37:35,564
- HyunA is a good talker. - Thank you.

1092
00:37:35,565 --> 00:37:37,439
- HyunA saved a person. - That was funny.

1093
00:37:38,065 --> 00:37:40,033
My team, EVERGLOW...

1094
00:37:40,034 --> 00:37:41,604
- EVERGLOW... - Try it.

1095
00:37:41,605 --> 00:37:44,934
- Can I promote EVERGLOW? - Go ahead.

1096
00:37:44,935 --> 00:37:47,109
(We want to see it.)

1097
00:37:47,335 --> 00:37:48,680
Do it.

1098
00:37:51,005 --> 00:37:53,350
She threw her team headband.

1099
00:37:54,315 --> 00:37:55,713
- The game is not important. - EVERGLOW is more important.

1100
00:37:55,714 --> 00:37:56,959
Of course, it is.

1101
00:37:57,185 --> 00:37:59,013
Is this poop or a snake, anyway?

1102
00:37:59,014 --> 00:38:00,589
It's green poop.

1103
00:38:00,955 --> 00:38:02,823
- Who knows? - Let's face it,

1104
00:38:02,824 --> 00:38:05,830
- she doesn't care a bit about you. - Of course not.

1105
00:38:05,994 --> 00:38:08,093
- She only cares about EVERGLOW. - She hasn't said anything to him.

1106
00:38:08,094 --> 00:38:09,093
Right.

1107
00:38:09,094 --> 00:38:11,463
Sihyeon only cares about herself and EVERGLOW.

1108
00:38:11,464 --> 00:38:12,740
(Her goal today is to promote herself and EVERGLOW.)

1109
00:38:12,964 --> 00:38:15,839
- Let's go, EVERGLOW! - All right.

1110
00:38:15,964 --> 00:38:18,204
("Bon Bon Chocolat" and "Adios" by EVERGLOW)

1111
00:38:18,205 --> 00:38:19,550
"Bon Bon Chocolat".

1112
00:38:20,935 --> 00:38:24,050
- Oh, my. - Oh, my.

1113
00:38:24,605 --> 00:38:27,120
(Sexy)

1114
00:38:28,214 --> 00:38:29,283
Oh, my.

1115
00:38:29,284 --> 00:38:30,959
Her dance is...

1116
00:38:31,585 --> 00:38:33,660
- very energetic. - She's a good dancer.

1117
00:38:35,125 --> 00:38:36,760
- Oh, my. - Oh, my.

1118
00:38:36,784 --> 00:38:39,423
- They're known for their dance. - Pardon?

1119
00:38:39,424 --> 00:38:41,499
- They're known for their dance. - Really?

1120
00:38:46,134 --> 00:38:48,209
(Powerful dance)

1121
00:38:49,435 --> 00:38:53,609
She's a very talented dancer.

1122
00:38:54,475 --> 00:38:55,649
I love the song.

1123
00:38:55,775 --> 00:38:57,050
Her dance is exceptional.

1124
00:38:57,605 --> 00:38:58,713
It's so cool.

1125
00:38:58,714 --> 00:39:00,050
(This is what So Min dreams of.)

1126
00:39:02,444 --> 00:39:03,760
All right.

1127
00:39:04,744 --> 00:39:05,959
"Bon Bon Chocolat".

1128
00:39:06,485 --> 00:39:08,053
She's an amazing dancer.

1129
00:39:08,054 --> 00:39:09,224
(The new singer is relieved now.)

1130
00:39:09,225 --> 00:39:11,530
You should have danced from the beginning.

1131
00:39:11,585 --> 00:39:12,923
The thing is,

1132
00:39:12,924 --> 00:39:15,024
I'm nervous on variety shows.

1133
00:39:15,025 --> 00:39:16,164
HyunA.

1134
00:39:16,165 --> 00:39:18,399
What do you feel after doing something like that?

1135
00:39:18,534 --> 00:39:19,863
"I at least did something."

1136
00:39:19,864 --> 00:39:22,539
(I at least did something.)

1137
00:39:25,034 --> 00:39:27,234
- That's very honest. - She's a good talker.

1138
00:39:27,235 --> 00:39:29,073
PSY, are you watching?

1139
00:39:29,074 --> 00:39:31,350
PSY, HyunA is a good talker.

1140
00:39:32,444 --> 00:39:35,089
- She's an amazing talker. - She's a great talker.

1141
00:39:35,444 --> 00:39:37,684
(Sihyeon successfully introduced herself thanks to the great talker.)

1142
00:39:37,685 --> 00:39:39,254
The teams are decided now.

1143
00:39:39,255 --> 00:39:41,684
Before starting the race,

1144
00:39:41,685 --> 00:39:45,024
- watch a video first. - A video?

1145
00:39:45,025 --> 00:39:47,493
- Someone... - Someone filmed something.

1146
00:39:47,494 --> 00:39:48,724
There's someone.

1147
00:39:48,725 --> 00:39:49,999
(The video starts playing.)

1148
00:39:50,225 --> 00:39:52,109
Once upon a time, on this farm,

1149
00:39:52,194 --> 00:39:54,769
many animals lived in harmony.

1150
00:39:54,835 --> 00:39:55,863
Animals?

1151
00:39:55,864 --> 00:39:58,649
A clean stream flowed across the farm all year round,

1152
00:39:58,804 --> 00:40:00,274
and there was always something to eat.

1153
00:40:00,275 --> 00:40:01,410
But then one day,

1154
00:40:02,375 --> 00:40:06,319
animals that shouldn't be allowed on the farm intruded.

1155
00:40:06,375 --> 00:40:08,113
(Animals that shouldn't be allowed on the farm intruded.)

1156
00:40:08,114 --> 00:40:09,390
Animals intruded?

1157
00:40:09,714 --> 00:40:10,914
- What? - What?

1158
00:40:10,915 --> 00:40:12,089
(Animals that shouldn't be allowed on the farm?)

1159
00:40:12,415 --> 00:40:14,629
The intruders turned the farm into a mess,

1160
00:40:14,815 --> 00:40:17,300
and the animals trembled with fear.

1161
00:40:18,594 --> 00:40:20,030
After a long time,

1162
00:40:20,054 --> 00:40:22,800
the farm is finally livable again.

1163
00:40:23,194 --> 00:40:25,593
The animals may come back home now.

1164
00:40:25,594 --> 00:40:29,133
However, do not bring the forbidden animals...

1165
00:40:29,134 --> 00:40:30,910
who will destroy the farm.

1166
00:40:30,964 --> 00:40:33,479
There are two forbidden animals among you.

1167
00:40:33,534 --> 00:40:36,274
Find and eliminate them.

1168
00:40:36,275 --> 00:40:37,680
(2 forbidden animals)

1169
00:40:38,105 --> 00:40:40,513
(There are two forbidden animals among them.)

1170
00:40:40,514 --> 00:40:41,819
Goodness.

1171
00:40:41,884 --> 00:40:43,789
- There are 2? - There are 2?

1172
00:40:44,284 --> 00:40:45,584
- There are two? - Forbidden animals?

1173
00:40:45,585 --> 00:40:46,830
There are two forbidden animals?

1174
00:40:46,915 --> 00:40:49,454
But they aren't necessarily a team.

1175
00:40:49,455 --> 00:40:50,624
- You're right. - You're right.

1176
00:40:50,625 --> 00:40:53,923
You win if you find and eliminate all forbidden animals.

1177
00:40:53,924 --> 00:40:57,399
You lose if you get eliminated by the forbidden animals.

1178
00:40:58,025 --> 00:41:00,394
The forbidden animals must carry out hidden missions...

1179
00:41:00,395 --> 00:41:01,903
before the final race.

1180
00:41:01,904 --> 00:41:04,204
They will be eliminated before the final race...

1181
00:41:04,205 --> 00:41:05,303
if they fail their mission.

1182
00:41:05,304 --> 00:41:07,004
(They will be eliminated before the final race if they fail.)

1183
00:41:07,005 --> 00:41:08,604
In each round, the winning team...

1184
00:41:08,605 --> 00:41:11,680
will receive a hint about the forbidden animals.

1185
00:41:12,214 --> 00:41:14,613
Let's get the race started.

1186
00:41:14,614 --> 00:41:16,044
(A match between 2 forbidden animals and 10 regular animals)

1187
00:41:16,045 --> 00:41:17,213
It's all about betrayal.

1188
00:41:17,214 --> 00:41:19,213
(The current teams)

1189
00:41:19,214 --> 00:41:21,959
(Who would be the 2 forbidden animals?)

1190
00:41:22,225 --> 00:41:25,923
Forbidden animals can get started on the hidden missions now.

1191
00:41:25,924 --> 00:41:27,794
- Are there hidden missions? - There are hidden missions.

1192
00:41:27,795 --> 00:41:29,863
If you try anything funny with me, I will take out your teeth.

1193
00:41:29,864 --> 00:41:33,069
- Your teeth are too uneven. - Watch yourself.

1194
00:41:33,464 --> 00:41:35,033
I am a bit suspicious of Han Na.

1195
00:41:35,034 --> 00:41:37,010
- It's about time she gets a role. - Me?

1196
00:41:37,065 --> 00:41:39,533
Han Na visited Running Man many times.

1197
00:41:39,534 --> 00:41:40,874
- She is good. - She is good.

1198
00:41:40,875 --> 00:41:42,303
I think I know who it is.

1199
00:41:42,304 --> 00:41:43,803
- Who? - Kwang Soo.

1200
00:41:43,804 --> 00:41:44,843
(She goes with her gut feeling.)

1201
00:41:44,844 --> 00:41:45,843
(Is it me again?)

1202
00:41:45,844 --> 00:41:47,443
- She doesn't know anything. - That's not true.

1203
00:41:47,444 --> 00:41:48,984
- He gets suspected every week. - When the talk...

1204
00:41:48,985 --> 00:41:50,914
of the hidden mission came up,

1205
00:41:50,915 --> 00:41:52,589
Kwang Soo's eyes looked weird.

1206
00:41:52,685 --> 00:41:54,053
- You should know this. - His eyes are always like that.

1207
00:41:54,054 --> 00:41:56,053
- His eyes are naturally weird. - What!

1208
00:41:56,054 --> 00:41:57,383
(His eyes are naturally weird.)

1209
00:41:57,384 --> 00:41:59,030
My eyes aren't weird!

1210
00:41:59,125 --> 00:42:01,254
- Kwang Soo has weird eyes. - This is how my eyes normally look.

1211
00:42:01,255 --> 00:42:03,593
- Kwang Soo's eyes are weird. - Even off-camera.

1212
00:42:03,594 --> 00:42:06,069
Is no one going to talk about HyunA's hat?

1213
00:42:06,165 --> 00:42:07,463
- That's right. - Jong Kook!

1214
00:42:07,464 --> 00:42:09,104
- It's pretty on HyunA. - What?

1215
00:42:09,105 --> 00:42:11,133
- It's pretty. - She looks cool.

1216
00:42:11,134 --> 00:42:12,834
It's a hat I actually own.

1217
00:42:12,835 --> 00:42:15,343
I like this hat.

1218
00:42:15,344 --> 00:42:18,019
Really? It's reminiscent of the late Korean Empire.

1219
00:42:18,074 --> 00:42:20,073
The hat is cool...

1220
00:42:20,074 --> 00:42:21,513
and I get that HyunA likes it,

1221
00:42:21,514 --> 00:42:22,644
(The hat is cool and I get that HyunA likes it...)

1222
00:42:22,645 --> 00:42:24,613
but it doesn't suit the current situation.

1223
00:42:24,614 --> 00:42:26,713
(It doesn't suit the current situation.)

1224
00:42:26,714 --> 00:42:27,984
I just want you to know that.

1225
00:42:27,985 --> 00:42:29,823
- I just want you to know that. - There are snacks hanging.

1226
00:42:29,824 --> 00:42:31,084
I just want you to know that.

1227
00:42:31,085 --> 00:42:33,970
- I am sure she knows. - I know,

1228
00:42:34,955 --> 00:42:36,564
- but I like the hat. - Okay.

1229
00:42:36,565 --> 00:42:38,894
- It gives me confidence. - Everyone, shut your mouth.

1230
00:42:38,895 --> 00:42:40,234
- What? - "Shut your mouth."

1231
00:42:40,235 --> 00:42:41,609
- Shut your mouth. - Okay.

1232
00:42:41,694 --> 00:42:43,204
She can wear whatever she likes.

1233
00:42:43,205 --> 00:42:45,140
Hold on. Who started this?

1234
00:42:45,835 --> 00:42:47,450
Jae Seok can be so mean.

1235
00:42:48,205 --> 00:42:50,180
- Do you want to lose your teeth? - What?

1236
00:42:50,744 --> 00:42:52,343
Why is Jae Seok so rough today?

1237
00:42:52,344 --> 00:42:53,589
Could it be a hidden mission?

1238
00:42:53,645 --> 00:42:56,490
The two forbidden animals...

1239
00:42:56,514 --> 00:42:58,754
must complete the hidden mission before the final race...

1240
00:42:58,755 --> 00:43:00,713
- to avoid getting eliminated. - Okay.

1241
00:43:00,714 --> 00:43:02,499
They get eliminated if they fail to complete it.

1242
00:43:03,025 --> 00:43:05,624
The first mission to acquire a hint on the forbidden animals is...

1243
00:43:05,625 --> 00:43:07,254
Trust Me Halfway.

1244
00:43:07,255 --> 00:43:09,300
(Trust Me Halfway)

1245
00:43:10,625 --> 00:43:12,363
Watch a dance video with half the screen covered...

1246
00:43:12,364 --> 00:43:14,434
and guess the song title and singer.

1247
00:43:14,435 --> 00:43:16,164
If your answers are right, dance to the music to succeed.

1248
00:43:16,165 --> 00:43:18,363
If you can't dance very well,

1249
00:43:18,364 --> 00:43:20,474
another team could steal the dance.

1250
00:43:20,475 --> 00:43:22,073
- Yes! We can steal. - Really?

1251
00:43:22,074 --> 00:43:23,149
My goodness.

1252
00:43:23,205 --> 00:43:25,374
The team that gets the most number of questions right...

1253
00:43:25,375 --> 00:43:27,419
will receive a hint on the forbidden animals.

1254
00:43:27,775 --> 00:43:29,013
This is a game for Gook Ju.

1255
00:43:29,014 --> 00:43:30,584
Gook Ju has an advantage.

1256
00:43:30,585 --> 00:43:33,013
- Gook Ju knows all the dances. - I know the old dances.

1257
00:43:33,014 --> 00:43:35,923
The teams that eat the snacks the fastest...

1258
00:43:35,924 --> 00:43:37,354
will have a priority.

1259
00:43:37,355 --> 00:43:39,254
We will show 10 seconds of the video.

1260
00:43:39,255 --> 00:43:41,294
- After you come out... - We come out if we know it, right?

1261
00:43:41,295 --> 00:43:42,863
That's right. For your information,

1262
00:43:42,864 --> 00:43:45,894
we will play an unrelated song in the background to confuse you.

1263
00:43:45,895 --> 00:43:47,834
- Really? - I see.

1264
00:43:47,835 --> 00:43:50,109
We need to guess from the dance alone.

1265
00:43:50,764 --> 00:43:51,974
- Let's do this. - Okay.

1266
00:43:51,975 --> 00:43:53,004
(Nervous)

1267
00:43:53,005 --> 00:43:54,149
Play.

1268
00:43:55,074 --> 00:43:57,620
(Watching carefully)

1269
00:44:00,645 --> 00:44:04,620
(Will they able to guess the song with just half the screen?)

1270
00:44:04,721 --> 00:44:09,221

1271
00:44:09,324 --> 00:44:10,830
Let me answer! Let me answer!

1272
00:44:10,985 --> 00:44:12,323
- Let me answer! - Does he know the answer?

1273
00:44:12,324 --> 00:44:14,053
What's the answer? What's the answer?

1274
00:44:14,054 --> 00:44:15,564
Go up.

1275
00:44:15,565 --> 00:44:17,300
- Go up. - This is impossible.

1276
00:44:17,665 --> 00:44:19,664
- Can you get it? - A bit more?

1277
00:44:19,665 --> 00:44:21,539
- Hold on. - Go up.

1278
00:44:21,935 --> 00:44:22,963
Go up.

1279
00:44:22,964 --> 00:44:24,510
(So Min steps on Haha's back. Jong Kook lifts up Sihyeon.)

1280
00:44:24,864 --> 00:44:26,573
I can't step on your back.

1281
00:44:26,574 --> 00:44:28,204
- How am I supposed to do that? - It's okay. Go up there.

1282
00:44:28,205 --> 00:44:30,104
You should do it.

1283
00:44:30,105 --> 00:44:32,274
(They change the footstool.)

1284
00:44:32,275 --> 00:44:34,474
Can you reach it?

1285
00:44:34,475 --> 00:44:37,713
(Gook Ju, I am sorry. Let's win!)

1286
00:44:37,714 --> 00:44:38,990
(Kwang Soo, you can do it!)

1287
00:44:39,714 --> 00:44:40,990
- Can I climb on your back? - Go ahead.

1288
00:44:41,315 --> 00:44:42,454
1, 2, 3.

1289
00:44:42,455 --> 00:44:45,030
Haha, I can't reach it. I can't reach it.

1290
00:44:46,054 --> 00:44:47,200
What?

1291
00:44:47,554 --> 00:44:49,363
(He screams and stands on his tiptoes to no avail.)

1292
00:44:49,364 --> 00:44:52,370
- Haha, that won't work. - I can't reach it.

1293
00:44:52,735 --> 00:44:54,910
(Heave-ho)

1294
00:44:55,194 --> 00:44:57,339
She can reach it. She will get it.

1295
00:44:57,605 --> 00:44:59,274
(Sihyeon succeeds first.)

1296
00:44:59,275 --> 00:45:01,004
- They did it. - We did it!

1297
00:45:01,005 --> 00:45:02,903
I think I am going to kiss So Min.

1298
00:45:02,904 --> 00:45:05,073
- I think I am going to kiss So Min. - HyunA!

1299
00:45:05,074 --> 00:45:06,573
- HyunA. - So Min.

1300
00:45:06,574 --> 00:45:07,713
HyunA, don't lose.

1301
00:45:07,714 --> 00:45:10,319
I can't reach it, Haha. I couldn't eat it.

1302
00:45:10,714 --> 00:45:11,743
(Only one snack remains!)

1303
00:45:11,744 --> 00:45:13,160
- This is it. - Here I go.

1304
00:45:13,185 --> 00:45:14,254
Don't fall.

1305
00:45:14,255 --> 00:45:15,724
- This is it. - I need to go down.

1306
00:45:15,725 --> 00:45:17,160
You need to get higher.

1307
00:45:17,855 --> 00:45:20,493
(The siblings are competitive.)

1308
00:45:20,494 --> 00:45:22,600
(Kwang Soo and Ji Hyo grab each other's hair.)

1309
00:45:23,565 --> 00:45:26,310
(Hair-grabbing in self-defense)

1310
00:45:26,895 --> 00:45:29,979
(The siblings have a fierce match for a snack.)

1311
00:45:30,105 --> 00:45:31,280
Ji Hyo!

1312
00:45:32,435 --> 00:45:34,173
(Ji Hyo is the last one to succeed.)

1313
00:45:34,174 --> 00:45:35,749
Good for her.

1314
00:45:36,145 --> 00:45:38,120
The one who succeeded first, Sihyeon, will answer.

1315
00:45:39,545 --> 00:45:43,919
(Can Sihyeon identify the song from the dance?)

1316
00:45:45,185 --> 00:45:46,430
What's the answer?

1317
00:45:46,685 --> 00:45:48,490
"Invitation" by Uhm Jung Hwa.

1318
00:45:49,585 --> 00:45:50,653
Is it right?

1319
00:45:50,654 --> 00:45:51,653
("Invitation"?)

1320
00:45:51,654 --> 00:45:52,830
Okay!

1321
00:45:58,364 --> 00:46:02,979
(It's a sexy dance that uses a fan.)

1322
00:46:03,864 --> 00:46:08,943
(Team Snake will receive a point if they pull off the dance!)

1323
00:46:08,944 --> 00:46:12,120
(The singer from the 20th century and the singer from 2019)

1324
00:46:13,614 --> 00:46:15,720
(He is as sexy as their backs.)

1325
00:46:16,815 --> 00:46:18,544
(Han Na comes forward to steal the dance.)

1326
00:46:18,545 --> 00:46:19,890
Let's go!

1327
00:46:21,154 --> 00:46:22,330
How did the dance go?

1328
00:46:22,355 --> 00:46:23,754
I don't know this part.

1329
00:46:23,755 --> 00:46:26,729
(She came forward without knowing the dance.)

1330
00:46:28,795 --> 00:46:29,823
(She dances as she wants.)

1331
00:46:29,824 --> 00:46:31,323
She is good.

1332
00:46:31,324 --> 00:46:32,693
(She dances as she wants.)

1333
00:46:32,694 --> 00:46:33,794
(She only claps at the right moment.)

1334
00:46:33,795 --> 00:46:35,269
She is Uhm Jung Hwa!

1335
00:46:36,134 --> 00:46:38,463
(I am Uhm Jung Hwa's doppelganger, Gook Jung Hwa.)

1336
00:46:38,464 --> 00:46:40,780
(She steals men's hearts with her lethal charms.)

1337
00:46:42,275 --> 00:46:45,303
(The main stage is a mess,)

1338
00:46:45,304 --> 00:46:46,713
(but she doesn't stop channeling Uhm Jung Hwa.)

1339
00:46:46,714 --> 00:46:48,319
What is Gook Ju doing?

1340
00:46:49,514 --> 00:46:51,919
- Come here. - Sihyeon got it right.

1341
00:46:52,014 --> 00:46:53,289
Thank goodness.

1342
00:46:54,915 --> 00:46:56,724
- Say, "Ding, dong, dang." - Sihyeon, ding, dong, dang.

1343
00:46:56,725 --> 00:46:57,823
Okay!

1344
00:46:57,824 --> 00:46:58,954
(Team Snake receives 1 point!)

1345
00:46:58,955 --> 00:47:00,169
All right.

1346
00:47:00,855 --> 00:47:02,363
It hurts my back less.

1347
00:47:02,364 --> 00:47:04,064
- Let's go. It's okay. - But you can't move far this way.

1348
00:47:04,065 --> 00:47:05,064
It's okay.

1349
00:47:05,065 --> 00:47:06,863
What are you doing?

1350
00:47:06,864 --> 00:47:09,204
- Hold on. - 1, 2, 3.

1351
00:47:09,205 --> 00:47:10,740
Hold on.

1352
00:47:11,435 --> 00:47:13,274
- What are you doing? - What are you doing?

1353
00:47:13,275 --> 00:47:14,950
(They practice hard for victory.)

1354
00:47:15,105 --> 00:47:16,374
I am heavy.

1355
00:47:16,375 --> 00:47:17,950
What is going on?

1356
00:47:18,505 --> 00:47:20,213
What is going on?

1357
00:47:20,214 --> 00:47:21,743
You know,

1358
00:47:21,744 --> 00:47:23,314
you should give Gook Ju a lift.

1359
00:47:23,315 --> 00:47:24,660
I want to do that.

1360
00:47:24,944 --> 00:47:26,213
I am trying my best.

1361
00:47:26,214 --> 00:47:28,089
Can't you carry Gook Ju on your shoulders?

1362
00:47:28,154 --> 00:47:29,454
- Can you? - Of course.

1363
00:47:29,455 --> 00:47:31,830
- Go ahead. - I can do it.

1364
00:47:31,985 --> 00:47:34,323
- You might get injured. - Don't worry about it.

1365
00:47:34,324 --> 00:47:37,300
- Hold it. - No matter how heavy you are...

1366
00:47:37,594 --> 00:47:39,539
Lower your torso. There you go.

1367
00:47:39,565 --> 00:47:41,064
It won't be easy to get up in that position.

1368
00:47:41,065 --> 00:47:42,209
I know.

1369
00:47:42,435 --> 00:47:44,680
(My goodness.)

1370
00:47:45,735 --> 00:47:47,204
All right.

1371
00:47:47,205 --> 00:47:48,573
(Jae Seok was confident.)

1372
00:47:48,574 --> 00:47:51,673
(Will he be able to carry Gook Ju on his shoulders?)

1373
00:47:51,674 --> 00:47:55,274
(Jae Seok, are you sure about this?)

1374
00:47:55,275 --> 00:47:58,419
(Gook Ju, I work out.)

1375
00:47:59,784 --> 00:48:00,814
(He gathers his strength.)

1376
00:48:00,815 --> 00:48:02,300
Okay, okay.

1377
00:48:03,154 --> 00:48:04,954
- Slowly. - Jae Seok fell asleep.

1378
00:48:04,955 --> 00:48:07,153
(Jae Seok fell asleep.)

1379
00:48:07,154 --> 00:48:08,724
- He fell asleep. - Get up.

1380
00:48:08,725 --> 00:48:10,524
- Get up. - My goodness.

1381
00:48:10,525 --> 00:48:12,664
- Anyone can do that. - Get up.

1382
00:48:12,665 --> 00:48:15,164
- We will support you. - Jae Seok.

1383
00:48:15,165 --> 00:48:18,533
- Gook Ju. - Yes?

1384
00:48:18,534 --> 00:48:20,033
Come down.

1385
00:48:20,034 --> 00:48:22,109
(Come down.)

1386
00:48:23,674 --> 00:48:25,673
(Gook Ju disembarks.)

1387
00:48:25,674 --> 00:48:27,013
His body almost folded in half.

1388
00:48:27,014 --> 00:48:29,783
- His body almost folded in half. - Don't say that.

1389
00:48:29,784 --> 00:48:30,843
Gook Ju, I am sorry.

1390
00:48:30,844 --> 00:48:32,854
Not many people can carry me on their shoulders.

1391
00:48:32,855 --> 00:48:34,760
- I am sorry. - Don't overexert yourself.

1392
00:48:34,815 --> 00:48:36,653
Not even my dad did that.

1393
00:48:36,654 --> 00:48:38,854
(Not even my dad did that.)

1394
00:48:38,855 --> 00:48:40,999
He never carried me on his shoulders.

1395
00:48:41,625 --> 00:48:43,399
- Let's move on to the next one. - Okay.

1396
00:48:43,424 --> 00:48:45,709
Play the video.

1397
00:48:46,994 --> 00:48:50,010
(It's even more confusing because of the song.)

1398
00:48:50,065 --> 00:48:51,209
What is it?

1399
00:49:02,884 --> 00:49:04,189
- I know the answer. - Okay.

1400
00:49:04,784 --> 00:49:06,589
- Do you know the answer? - I think so.

1401
00:49:07,185 --> 00:49:09,184
(They have a fierce fight for a spot.)

1402
00:49:09,185 --> 00:49:11,260
Hey, what are you doing? Get out of the way!

1403
00:49:12,255 --> 00:49:14,430
Go up. Can you reach it?

1404
00:49:14,924 --> 00:49:15,993
Can you reach it?

1405
00:49:15,994 --> 00:49:17,640
Can you move a bit to the side?

1406
00:49:17,764 --> 00:49:18,970
- A bit to the side. - Okay.

1407
00:49:19,864 --> 00:49:21,593
- I did it. I ate it. - Did you eat it?

1408
00:49:21,594 --> 00:49:22,803
We ate it.

1409
00:49:22,804 --> 00:49:24,109
- I ate it. - Okay.

1410
00:49:24,705 --> 00:49:26,004
Go up.

1411
00:49:26,005 --> 00:49:28,803
(Kwang Soo also falls asleep during the game.)

1412
00:49:28,804 --> 00:49:31,649
(This must be a bad nightmare.)

1413
00:49:32,475 --> 00:49:33,874
(Seok Jin-borghini starts from the garage...)

1414
00:49:33,875 --> 00:49:36,984
(because he can't get up by himself.)

1415
00:49:36,985 --> 00:49:38,343
(0.1 horsepower)

1416
00:49:38,344 --> 00:49:39,553
(0.1-cylinder engine)

1417
00:49:39,554 --> 00:49:42,084
(The engine sound is 1000dB.)

1418
00:49:42,085 --> 00:49:43,454
Here. Go up there.

1419
00:49:43,455 --> 00:49:44,724
Move forward.

1420
00:49:44,725 --> 00:49:46,530
I can't move forward. Gook Ju is blocking the way.

1421
00:49:46,895 --> 00:49:49,600
(The self-driving mode gets turned on because of Gook Ju.)

1422
00:49:50,324 --> 00:49:51,363
(Thanks to Seok Jin-borghini, Han Na places 3rd.)

1423
00:49:51,364 --> 00:49:52,934
- I ate it. - Did you eat it?

1424
00:49:52,935 --> 00:49:54,493
- I ate it. - You ate it.

1425
00:49:54,494 --> 00:49:55,939
(Sihyeon has a chance to answer first.)

1426
00:49:58,034 --> 00:50:01,850
(Will Sihyeon get the answer right this time as well?)

1427
00:50:04,944 --> 00:50:06,350
Sihyeon, what's the answer?

1428
00:50:06,545 --> 00:50:08,450
"Bad Girl, Good Girl" by miss A.

1429
00:50:09,014 --> 00:50:10,689
(I think she got it right.)

1430
00:50:11,915 --> 00:50:13,229
(Correct)

1431
00:50:15,154 --> 00:50:16,330
Did she say "White blood cell"?

1432
00:50:16,625 --> 00:50:17,830
"White blood cell"?

1433
00:50:17,884 --> 00:50:19,930
I don't know a song called "White blood cell".

1434
00:50:20,455 --> 00:50:22,093
- "White blood cell"? - "White blood cell"?

1435
00:50:22,094 --> 00:50:24,064
She said, "Bad Girl, Good Girl".

1436
00:50:24,065 --> 00:50:25,064
"Bad Girl, Good Girl".

1437
00:50:25,065 --> 00:50:27,370
Where did "White blood cell" come from?

1438
00:50:35,205 --> 00:50:36,943
I know the song.

1439
00:50:36,944 --> 00:50:37,943
(The intro makes their bodies move.)

1440
00:50:37,944 --> 00:50:39,113
- It's Suzy. - I know the song.

1441
00:50:39,114 --> 00:50:40,213
HyunA, let's go.

1442
00:50:40,214 --> 00:50:41,749
"You don't know me."

1443
00:50:42,744 --> 00:50:44,819
What are you doing here?

1444
00:50:45,185 --> 00:50:47,484
(The dancing queen does her own thing.)

1445
00:50:47,485 --> 00:50:49,754
- Do you know the dance? - Of course, I do.

1446
00:50:49,755 --> 00:50:51,499
- I need space. - She is incredible.

1447
00:50:56,594 --> 00:50:59,093
What are you doing, Gook Ju?

1448
00:50:59,094 --> 00:51:00,533
- That's her private camera. - Okay.

1449
00:51:00,534 --> 00:51:01,734
(It's perfect teamwork between miss A and the A plus team.)

1450
00:51:01,735 --> 00:51:03,539
What's that, Jong Kook?

1451
00:51:03,665 --> 00:51:05,064
He's really pretty.

1452
00:51:05,065 --> 00:51:07,109
- I know this. - Shut up, shut up

1453
00:51:07,574 --> 00:51:09,274
(She moves over.)

1454
00:51:09,275 --> 00:51:11,104
(She walks to the center,)

1455
00:51:11,105 --> 00:51:12,819
(and plops down.)

1456
00:51:13,114 --> 00:51:14,113
(She starts dancing.)

1457
00:51:14,114 --> 00:51:15,220
- Look. - What is she doing?

1458
00:51:15,574 --> 00:51:17,013
She's right.

1459
00:51:17,014 --> 00:51:18,314
- Look at So Min. - What is she doing?

1460
00:51:18,315 --> 00:51:20,084
This is the choreography.

1461
00:51:20,085 --> 00:51:21,354
I'm speechless.

1462
00:51:21,355 --> 00:51:22,423
Next.

1463
00:51:22,424 --> 00:51:24,160
- Next. - HyunA

1464
00:51:24,725 --> 00:51:26,354
Here she goes.

1465
00:51:26,355 --> 00:51:28,423
(Dance Queen HyunA is ready.)

1466
00:51:28,424 --> 00:51:30,093
- What about you? - You have to dance too.

1467
00:51:30,094 --> 00:51:31,724
- Why don't you know it? - I'll do it too.

1468
00:51:31,725 --> 00:51:32,734
(She's got the groove.)

1469
00:51:32,735 --> 00:51:33,810
Why don't you know it?

1470
00:51:34,134 --> 00:51:36,439
- What's that? - What's he doing?

1471
00:51:36,835 --> 00:51:38,339
(Glancing)

1472
00:51:39,005 --> 00:51:40,234
- Do you know this? - She's amazing.

1473
00:51:40,235 --> 00:51:42,410
- She's amazing. - She knows everything.

1474
00:51:43,944 --> 00:51:46,013
(The scorpion move was unnecessary.)

1475
00:51:46,014 --> 00:51:48,450
- What's that, Jae Seok? - What are you doing?

1476
00:51:48,944 --> 00:51:51,490
(She gets rid of the scorpion.)

1477
00:51:51,585 --> 00:51:52,713
Don't get in her way.

1478
00:51:52,714 --> 00:51:54,354
- He got hit. - Keep going.

1479
00:51:54,355 --> 00:51:56,499
Go, So Min.

1480
00:51:57,025 --> 00:51:58,129
Here I go.

1481
00:51:58,985 --> 00:52:00,593
(She's the brave dancer of this territory.)

1482
00:52:00,594 --> 00:52:01,970
She's cute.

1483
00:52:02,725 --> 00:52:03,794
Get out of there.

1484
00:52:03,795 --> 00:52:05,124
- Tell her to get out. - Move.

1485
00:52:05,125 --> 00:52:07,164
- Move. - Tell her to move.

1486
00:52:07,165 --> 00:52:10,109
- Let's do it together. - I don't know this dance.

1487
00:52:11,534 --> 00:52:12,810
Go, Han Na.

1488
00:52:13,505 --> 00:52:14,780
What's that?

1489
00:52:15,134 --> 00:52:16,220
Goodness.

1490
00:52:16,645 --> 00:52:17,903
Nice one.

1491
00:52:17,904 --> 00:52:18,979
Han Na.

1492
00:52:19,645 --> 00:52:20,774
Nice, Han Na.

1493
00:52:20,775 --> 00:52:22,584
(She destroyed the choreography and the rhythm.)

1494
00:52:22,585 --> 00:52:25,160
(It's all about the feel.)

1495
00:52:26,985 --> 00:52:28,084
Good job, Han Na.

1496
00:52:28,085 --> 00:52:29,600
(I'm good, right?)

1497
00:52:31,085 --> 00:52:32,359
She's good.

1498
00:52:33,154 --> 00:52:35,330
Get back.

1499
00:52:35,594 --> 00:52:37,124
(They don't move.)

1500
00:52:37,125 --> 00:52:38,224
Hey.

1501
00:52:38,225 --> 00:52:40,133
This is a one-man show.

1502
00:52:40,134 --> 00:52:42,370
Hold on, Gook Ju.

1503
00:52:42,534 --> 00:52:45,734
When you were going down, I thought you were The Undertaker.

1504
00:52:45,735 --> 00:52:46,734
(When you were going down, I thought you were The Undertaker.)

1505
00:52:46,735 --> 00:52:48,709
(She's a legendary professional wrestler.)

1506
00:52:50,045 --> 00:52:52,073
- The Undertaker? - I thought you were him.

1507
00:52:52,074 --> 00:52:53,843
Stop it.

1508
00:52:53,844 --> 00:52:57,189
You said that last time too.

1509
00:52:57,415 --> 00:53:00,113
- Sihyeon wins. - All right!

1510
00:53:00,114 --> 00:53:02,213
- We did it. - We did it.

1511
00:53:02,214 --> 00:53:03,999
- Good job. - We have to get it this time.

1512
00:53:04,525 --> 00:53:05,524
We have to get it.

1513
00:53:05,525 --> 00:53:07,323
It was so funny when you went down.

1514
00:53:07,324 --> 00:53:08,323
Was it okay?

1515
00:53:08,324 --> 00:53:09,624
I thought you were The Undertaker.

1516
00:53:09,625 --> 00:53:11,624
I've never seen this person.

1517
00:53:11,625 --> 00:53:13,133
Make sure you don't collapse.

1518
00:53:13,134 --> 00:53:14,633
Haha made me feel worse.

1519
00:53:14,634 --> 00:53:15,794
- "You look similar to him." - I'm serious.

1520
00:53:15,795 --> 00:53:17,533
- He used to be really popular. - Really?

1521
00:53:17,534 --> 00:53:19,680
He rolled his eyes.

1522
00:53:19,935 --> 00:53:22,803
- The Undertaker. - Like this?

1523
00:53:22,804 --> 00:53:23,803
(You look like me.)

1524
00:53:23,804 --> 00:53:25,479
- You look the same. - Is this right?

1525
00:53:25,505 --> 00:53:26,890
You look the same.

1526
00:53:28,214 --> 00:53:31,720
I don't know what this is. I did whatever they told me to do.

1527
00:53:32,014 --> 00:53:33,113
(Swinging)

1528
00:53:33,114 --> 00:53:35,513
Jae Seok looks very free today. There's something going on.

1529
00:53:35,514 --> 00:53:38,624
- Right? There's something going on. - He's moving a lot on purpose.

1530
00:53:38,625 --> 00:53:42,423
There's somebody who's doing something irrelevant to this game.

1531
00:53:42,424 --> 00:53:44,423
- Look at his face. - It's not Jae Seok.

1532
00:53:44,424 --> 00:53:45,423
(Look at Kwang Soo's face.)

1533
00:53:45,424 --> 00:53:47,234
(Han Na's gaze is fixed on Kwang Soo.)

1534
00:53:47,235 --> 00:53:48,463
It's not me.

1535
00:53:48,464 --> 00:53:49,963
- I'm just looking around. - It's not Jae Seok.

1536
00:53:49,964 --> 00:53:52,334
He wasn't looking around.

1537
00:53:52,335 --> 00:53:54,234
When we were talking, he was looking off in distance.

1538
00:53:54,235 --> 00:53:56,704
- No, I didn't. - Why were you looking at the jib?

1539
00:53:56,705 --> 00:53:58,374
(His eyes rested on the jib.)

1540
00:53:58,375 --> 00:54:00,914
- I wasn't looking at that. - What were you doing?

1541
00:54:00,915 --> 00:54:02,120
Nothing.

1542
00:54:02,944 --> 00:54:05,319
This is a difficult question for two points.

1543
00:54:05,514 --> 00:54:07,990
- Here's the next question. - Let's go!

1544
00:54:08,214 --> 00:54:10,200
Please play the video.

1545
00:54:11,625 --> 00:54:13,724
- This one is for two points. - What?

1546
00:54:13,725 --> 00:54:15,693
Let's go.

1547
00:54:15,694 --> 00:54:17,493
It's an old song. Wait.

1548
00:54:17,494 --> 00:54:20,439
(It's not an easy question.)

1549
00:54:27,205 --> 00:54:28,673
- Who is it? Chakra? - Who's that?

1550
00:54:28,674 --> 00:54:30,343
- Chakra. - I'm not sure.

1551
00:54:30,344 --> 00:54:32,173
- Eat first. - Go this way.

1552
00:54:32,174 --> 00:54:34,249
- I got it. - 2, 3.

1553
00:54:36,344 --> 00:54:37,513
Little more.

1554
00:54:37,514 --> 00:54:39,213
- Where? - I ate it.

1555
00:54:39,214 --> 00:54:40,713
- Did you eat it? - You can't push me.

1556
00:54:40,714 --> 00:54:41,914
Kwang Soo.

1557
00:54:41,915 --> 00:54:44,684
- I got it. - Go left.

1558
00:54:44,685 --> 00:54:45,883
- She ate it. - I got it.

1559
00:54:45,884 --> 00:54:47,524
- Come down. - Look at the outfit.

1560
00:54:47,525 --> 00:54:49,093
- There were two people. - Do you know who it is?

1561
00:54:49,094 --> 00:54:50,423
Ji Hyo was first.

1562
00:54:50,424 --> 00:54:52,939
I'll leave it up to her.

1563
00:55:01,705 --> 00:55:03,743
What's this? Nobody knows yet.

1564
00:55:03,744 --> 00:55:04,903
The singer is...

1565
00:55:04,904 --> 00:55:06,089
(Will Ji Hyo and Se Chan get the answer?)

1566
00:55:06,444 --> 00:55:09,149
- Baek Z Young. - Baek Z Young. The song is "Dash".

1567
00:55:09,214 --> 00:55:10,490
They got it.

1568
00:55:10,915 --> 00:55:12,754
Right?

1569
00:55:12,755 --> 00:55:14,990
- How did she know? - I didn't know.

1570
00:55:19,855 --> 00:55:24,939
("Dash" is known for the powerful Latin dance.)

1571
00:55:26,845 --> 00:55:29,013
(The song plays.)

1572
00:55:29,014 --> 00:55:30,813
- What is that? - They don't know it.

1573
00:55:30,814 --> 00:55:32,290
- What is that? - What is that?

1574
00:55:32,514 --> 00:55:33,799
What dance is that?

1575
00:55:34,025 --> 00:55:35,384
- What are they doing? - What is that?

1576
00:55:35,385 --> 00:55:36,853
- Is this "Dash"? - They're incorrect.

1577
00:55:36,854 --> 00:55:39,230
(I don't agree with this "Dash".)

1578
00:55:39,965 --> 00:55:41,824
- Gosh. - I don't know the dance.

1579
00:55:41,825 --> 00:55:43,509
- I don't know it. - Move.

1580
00:55:44,294 --> 00:55:45,369
Let's go.

1581
00:55:45,635 --> 00:55:47,940
Do it like this.

1582
00:55:48,635 --> 00:55:50,203
(They have the Latin soul...)

1583
00:55:50,204 --> 00:55:54,049
(on their faces.)

1584
00:55:54,805 --> 00:55:56,389
- They're good. - What's that?

1585
00:55:58,215 --> 00:56:00,889
Move. 1, 2, 3, 4.

1586
00:56:01,285 --> 00:56:03,614
(They continue the vibe, and do the samba.)

1587
00:56:03,615 --> 00:56:04,813
How's this "Dash"?

1588
00:56:04,814 --> 00:56:05,929
(They continue the vibe, and do the samba.)

1589
00:56:08,025 --> 00:56:10,900
(This is a tank dash.)

1590
00:56:11,624 --> 00:56:13,893
(This is a collection of old dances.)

1591
00:56:13,894 --> 00:56:15,993
- What are you doing? - Stop it.

1592
00:56:15,994 --> 00:56:19,433
(The Undertaker is in Itaewon after a breakup.)

1593
00:56:19,434 --> 00:56:20,964
What is she doing?

1594
00:56:20,965 --> 00:56:23,703
(She tries to overcome the pain with dancing.)

1595
00:56:23,704 --> 00:56:25,880
(Is she here alone?)

1596
00:56:26,974 --> 00:56:29,103
(This freestyle dance duo is here together.)

1597
00:56:29,104 --> 00:56:32,513
We have to give it to Han Na.

1598
00:56:32,514 --> 00:56:34,214
We have to give it to her.

1599
00:56:34,215 --> 00:56:36,453
She deserves it.

1600
00:56:36,454 --> 00:56:37,630
Okay.

1601
00:56:38,215 --> 00:56:40,183
What's this now?

1602
00:56:40,184 --> 00:56:42,453
What's this?

1603
00:56:42,454 --> 00:56:44,024
- What are you doing? - What's this?

1604
00:56:44,025 --> 00:56:46,324
What are you doing?

1605
00:56:46,325 --> 00:56:48,364
- What are you doing? - This is "Dash".

1606
00:56:48,365 --> 00:56:49,563
What's that?

1607
00:56:49,564 --> 00:56:50,964
What?

1608
00:56:50,965 --> 00:56:53,364
- When were you ever interested? - You are a dirty punk.

1609
00:56:53,365 --> 00:56:55,480
We got the question right. Give us the points.

1610
00:56:55,535 --> 00:56:56,603
Producer.

1611
00:56:56,604 --> 00:56:58,949
- I danced to everything. - Are you okay, The Undertaker?

1612
00:56:59,744 --> 00:57:01,643
Give it to us. We weren't bad.

1613
00:57:01,644 --> 00:57:03,513
Team Bear got the question right,

1614
00:57:03,514 --> 00:57:05,650
and Team Rabbit will get a point for the dance.

1615
00:57:05,974 --> 00:57:07,813
(Team Snake: 2 points, Team Rabbit: 1 point, Team Bear: 1 point)

1616
00:57:07,814 --> 00:57:09,614
- We have two points. - Okay!

1617
00:57:09,615 --> 00:57:11,730
This is not bad. Good job, Ji Hyo.

1618
00:57:11,814 --> 00:57:12,824
We have two points.

1619
00:57:12,825 --> 00:57:16,194
The teams that will receive hints about the forbidden animal...

1620
00:57:16,195 --> 00:57:17,554
- are Team Bear and Team Snake. - All right.

1621
00:57:17,555 --> 00:57:18,793
- You did it. - Okay.

1622
00:57:18,794 --> 00:57:20,563
- She did it. - We did it.

1623
00:57:20,564 --> 00:57:23,163
Team Bear and Team Snake, please come on up and check.

1624
00:57:23,164 --> 00:57:24,839
Okay, let's check.

1625
00:57:25,794 --> 00:57:27,380
(They're still doing that.)

1626
00:57:27,564 --> 00:57:29,634
- Just the four of you. - Se Chan.

1627
00:57:29,635 --> 00:57:31,004
What is that? Is that for the mission?

1628
00:57:31,005 --> 00:57:32,634
- What? - What's is that on your foot?

1629
00:57:32,635 --> 00:57:34,703
Let's see. Lift your left foot.

1630
00:57:34,704 --> 00:57:36,973
Lift it like this. What is that?

1631
00:57:36,974 --> 00:57:38,074
- What is it? - What is it?

1632
00:57:38,075 --> 00:57:39,174
(Ji Hyo's name tag is on the sole of his foot.)

1633
00:57:39,175 --> 00:57:41,813
- I think he stepped on it. - Why do you have her name tag?

1634
00:57:41,814 --> 00:57:43,730
(Why is it on the sole of his foot?)

1635
00:57:43,985 --> 00:57:45,889
Why does he keep putting it on his shoe?

1636
00:57:46,014 --> 00:57:48,830
(He had something on his shoe in previous episodes as well.)

1637
00:57:50,454 --> 00:57:53,094
(It's suspicious that Ji Hyo's name tag is on his shoe.)

1638
00:57:53,095 --> 00:57:54,670
This is strange. Why is this here?

1639
00:57:54,695 --> 00:57:57,194
What are the chances of getting that stuck on his shoe?

1640
00:57:57,195 --> 00:57:59,509
- It can. It comes off easily. - Why is this stuck here?

1641
00:57:59,535 --> 00:58:01,034
Did you take mine?

1642
00:58:01,035 --> 00:58:02,904
Have a look at the hint.

1643
00:58:02,905 --> 00:58:05,074
Ji Hyo.

1644
00:58:05,075 --> 00:58:06,350
I'm here.

1645
00:58:06,805 --> 00:58:08,480
My name tag is gone.

1646
00:58:08,905 --> 00:58:10,174
I'm mad.

1647
00:58:10,175 --> 00:58:11,449
(What?)

1648
00:58:12,615 --> 00:58:15,460
- That's good. - I should have done this.

1649
00:58:17,184 --> 00:58:18,513
Jae Seok is acting strange.

1650
00:58:18,514 --> 00:58:20,699
- Why? - Why would you climb that?

1651
00:58:20,825 --> 00:58:22,630
He's amusing like that.

1652
00:58:22,655 --> 00:58:24,524
- Why are you taking his side? - How did you get that scar?

1653
00:58:24,525 --> 00:58:26,054
- I was fooling around. - Right.

1654
00:58:26,055 --> 00:58:27,440
He's fooling around too.

1655
00:58:27,494 --> 00:58:29,670
Kwang Soo was climbing that too.

1656
00:58:29,894 --> 00:58:30,964
I was going to eat that.

1657
00:58:30,965 --> 00:58:32,094
Sit down.

1658
00:58:32,095 --> 00:58:33,904
- Is it over now? - No.

1659
00:58:33,905 --> 00:58:35,580
I mean the airing.

1660
00:58:37,635 --> 00:58:40,804
How's it over? It's not over.

1661
00:58:40,805 --> 00:58:42,344
It's not over?

1662
00:58:42,345 --> 00:58:43,473
Is this it?

1663
00:58:43,474 --> 00:58:44,473
(It'd be funny if this was it.)

1664
00:58:44,474 --> 00:58:46,284
- I'm so tired. - I know.

1665
00:58:46,285 --> 00:58:49,284
We used too much energy.

1666
00:58:49,285 --> 00:58:51,654
I think I danced well today. Wasn't it pretty good?

1667
00:58:51,655 --> 00:58:53,484
You were really good.

1668
00:58:53,485 --> 00:58:55,324
- I was pretty good today. - You improved a lot.

1669
00:58:55,325 --> 00:58:56,654
- I think I got better. - You improved a lot.

1670
00:58:56,655 --> 00:58:58,630
- That's right. - One team at a time.

1671
00:58:59,095 --> 00:59:00,400
Hold on.

1672
00:59:03,164 --> 00:59:04,610
Then...

1673
00:59:04,894 --> 00:59:05,964
(They look confused.)

1674
00:59:05,965 --> 00:59:07,534
- It's something to do with a snake. - Did you see it?

1675
00:59:07,535 --> 00:59:11,179
This is not about a person, right? It's a hint about the animal.

1676
00:59:12,005 --> 00:59:13,703
I'm narrowing down now.

1677
00:59:13,704 --> 00:59:16,279
(What hint did they get?)

1678
00:59:16,974 --> 00:59:19,714
Round one is over now. Let's move on to the next location.

1679
00:59:19,715 --> 00:59:20,714
- Okay! - Okay!

1680
00:59:20,715 --> 00:59:23,453
(They move on to the next location after receiving a hint.)

1681
00:59:23,454 --> 00:59:26,083
Sihyeon...

1682
00:59:26,084 --> 00:59:28,799
resembles Suzy a bit.

1683
00:59:29,025 --> 00:59:31,123
- You do look like Suzy. - I thought of that too.

1684
00:59:31,124 --> 00:59:33,424
I was wondering who you looked like. You look like Suzy.

1685
00:59:33,425 --> 00:59:35,893
I thought it was Suzy when she first opened the door.

1686
00:59:35,894 --> 00:59:37,893
- When she came through the door. - Stop it.

1687
00:59:37,894 --> 00:59:40,639
- Thank you. - Stop it.

1688
00:59:40,905 --> 00:59:42,480
- Stop it. - He exaggerates.

1689
00:59:42,735 --> 00:59:43,833
Kwang Soo.

1690
00:59:43,834 --> 00:59:45,234
For goodness' sake.

1691
00:59:45,235 --> 00:59:47,504
Sihyeon didn't say, "That's not true."

1692
00:59:47,505 --> 00:59:48,904
- I mean... - I bet she heard that often.

1693
00:59:48,905 --> 00:59:51,344
I am sure Sihyeon heard that often.

1694
00:59:51,345 --> 00:59:53,844
- She looks like SUNMI too. - Right now...

1695
00:59:53,845 --> 00:59:56,219
- She looks like SUNMI too. - I see the resemblance.

1696
00:59:56,414 --> 00:59:58,830
- She looks like Noh Joo Hyun. - She looks exactly like him.

1697
00:59:58,885 --> 01:00:00,654
- I see the resemblance. - Seriously.

1698
01:00:00,655 --> 01:00:01,929
(They could be a father and a daughter.)

1699
01:00:01,954 --> 01:00:03,953
She looks like Han Min Kwan too.

1700
01:00:03,954 --> 01:00:05,069
That's right.

1701
01:00:05,255 --> 01:00:06,400
He is a lucky man.

1702
01:00:07,294 --> 01:00:08,500
Min Kwan!

1703
01:00:09,095 --> 01:00:10,364
Jong Kook looks like Park Se Ri.

1704
01:00:10,365 --> 01:00:12,869
(Park Se Ri)

1705
01:00:13,264 --> 01:00:14,710
There is a strong resemblance.

1706
01:00:15,365 --> 01:00:17,650
- I look exactly like her. - Even the hairstyle is the same.

1707
01:00:17,934 --> 01:00:19,674
Se Chan looks like Han Moo.

1708
01:00:19,675 --> 01:00:21,679
- Kim Kap Soo. - You are right.

1709
01:00:22,104 --> 01:00:23,873
Haha looks like Lee Hwi Jae.

1710
01:00:23,874 --> 01:00:25,643
- Lee Hwi Jae. - Lee Hwi Jae and Lee Moon Sae.

1711
01:00:25,644 --> 01:00:26,743
Lee Moon Sae.

1712
01:00:26,744 --> 01:00:29,190
- Kwang Soo looks like Han Ki Bum. - Han Ki Bum.

1713
01:00:29,215 --> 01:00:30,554
He resembles Ki Bum a lot.

1714
01:00:30,555 --> 01:00:32,214
- The Undertaker. - The Undertaker.

1715
01:00:32,215 --> 01:00:33,754
I look like Kwak Do Won, okay?

1716
01:00:33,755 --> 01:00:35,083
There is another one, but Se Chan won't tell us.

1717
01:00:35,084 --> 01:00:36,754
Tell us. Who is it?

1718
01:00:36,755 --> 01:00:38,699
- There is another one. - Tell us.

1719
01:00:38,724 --> 01:00:40,364
- Tell us, Se Chan. It's okay. - Promise you won't be upset.

1720
01:00:40,365 --> 01:00:42,123
- Promise. - I promise.

1721
01:00:42,124 --> 01:00:43,464
She won't get upset.

1722
01:00:43,465 --> 01:00:45,409
The Penguin.

1723
01:00:45,865 --> 01:00:47,103
You little...

1724
01:00:47,104 --> 01:00:48,433
(You beautiful little man.)

1725
01:00:48,434 --> 01:00:50,580
Come on. You said you won't get upset.

1726
01:00:50,604 --> 01:00:52,074
Isn't The Penguin better?

1727
01:00:52,075 --> 01:00:53,174
- What? - My goodness.

1728
01:00:53,175 --> 01:00:54,873
The Penguin is cute.

1729
01:00:54,874 --> 01:00:56,373
It's not a penguin character...

1730
01:00:56,374 --> 01:00:57,674
- you know of. - Really?

1731
01:00:57,675 --> 01:01:00,083
I dressed up as The Penguin in "Comedy Big League".

1732
01:01:00,084 --> 01:01:02,960
- That's right. - I don't like dressing up that way.

1733
01:01:03,014 --> 01:01:04,429
I prefer telling jokes.

1734
01:01:04,454 --> 01:01:07,199
Park Na Rae and Jang Do Yeon came up with a scheme...

1735
01:01:07,325 --> 01:01:09,659
to make me dress up as The Penguin when I went to the restroom.

1736
01:01:09,894 --> 01:01:12,223
Everything moved speedily. As soon as I sat down, they went,

1737
01:01:12,224 --> 01:01:13,694
"You can dress up as The Penguin, right?"

1738
01:01:13,695 --> 01:01:15,440
"Dress up as The Penguin, okay?" That was how it happened.

1739
01:01:15,465 --> 01:01:17,563
I was so embarrassed since it was my first time...

1740
01:01:17,564 --> 01:01:18,634
to do something like that.

1741
01:01:18,635 --> 01:01:20,710
I closed my eyes and fell asleep.

1742
01:01:20,735 --> 01:01:24,110
All the comediennes took photos and said, "This is Hollywood."

1743
01:01:24,204 --> 01:01:27,049
- They took so many photos. - It was perfect.

1744
01:01:27,075 --> 01:01:29,444
Send the production crew a photo.

1745
01:01:29,445 --> 01:01:31,143
They can find it themselves.

1746
01:01:31,144 --> 01:01:32,920
I don't want to find it.

1747
01:01:33,885 --> 01:01:36,114
(She sleeps when she is embarrassed.)

1748
01:01:36,115 --> 01:01:38,284
I don't think HyunA resembles anyone.

1749
01:01:38,285 --> 01:01:39,513
She doesn't have any lookalikes.

1750
01:01:39,514 --> 01:01:41,324
- Has anyone mentioned anybody? - HyunA would have...

1751
01:01:41,325 --> 01:01:42,929
lookalikes in the US.

1752
01:01:43,124 --> 01:01:44,254
I don't have any lookalikes.

1753
01:01:44,255 --> 01:01:45,293
That's right.

1754
01:01:45,294 --> 01:01:46,893
Is that mole real?

1755
01:01:46,894 --> 01:01:48,063
- It's real. - Did you draw it?

1756
01:01:48,064 --> 01:01:49,194
Oh, it's real.

1757
01:01:49,195 --> 01:01:51,364
Seok Jin, is that age spot real? Did you draw it?

1758
01:01:51,365 --> 01:01:54,179
(He is genuinely curious.)

1759
01:01:54,735 --> 01:01:57,110
- It's real. - It's not an age spot!

1760
01:01:57,405 --> 01:01:59,179
Did you paste the hair on your ears?

1761
01:01:59,805 --> 01:02:01,944
- I don't have hair on my ears! - I guess it has a function.

1762
01:02:01,945 --> 01:02:03,913
Ant legs were sticking out.

1763
01:02:03,914 --> 01:02:05,243
Ant legs!

1764
01:02:05,244 --> 01:02:06,813
- Ant legs were sticking out. - Ant legs!

1765
01:02:06,814 --> 01:02:08,714
(Seok Jin has an age spot and ant legs.)

1766
01:02:08,715 --> 01:02:11,984
Forbidden animals, you can do your mission now.

1767
01:02:11,985 --> 01:02:14,453
They can do their mission now? I guess they aren't doing it.

1768
01:02:14,454 --> 01:02:15,884
We don't know what the mission is.

1769
01:02:15,885 --> 01:02:17,699
Won't tell us if they did it earlier?

1770
01:02:17,755 --> 01:02:19,869
- Why won't you tell us this time? - I guess they did it.

1771
01:02:19,894 --> 01:02:21,699
We will tell you before the final race.

1772
01:02:21,825 --> 01:02:23,839
I guess it can be done sitting down.

1773
01:02:24,735 --> 01:02:26,369
People in the back are suspicious.

1774
01:02:26,434 --> 01:02:28,433
Kwang Soo is too quiet. Everyone is guessing,

1775
01:02:28,434 --> 01:02:30,203
- but he isn't saying a thing. - It's not like that.

1776
01:02:30,204 --> 01:02:32,110
Seriously, Kwang Soo. Why are you so quiet?

1777
01:02:32,305 --> 01:02:34,373
- Seriously. - I think it's something you say.

1778
01:02:34,374 --> 01:02:36,004
I don't think that's the case.

1779
01:02:36,005 --> 01:02:37,344
(Everyone is suspicious of Kwang Soo.)

1780
01:02:37,345 --> 01:02:39,743
(Could he be 1 of the 2 forbidden animals?)

1781
01:02:39,744 --> 01:02:41,643
I prepared an acrostic poem.

1782
01:02:41,644 --> 01:02:42,944
She prepared an acrostic poem.

1783
01:02:42,945 --> 01:02:45,384
- That came out of nowhere. - Do everything you prepared.

1784
01:02:45,385 --> 01:02:47,453
It's no wonder she only got an hour of sleep.

1785
01:02:47,454 --> 01:02:48,554
She prepared many things.

1786
01:02:48,555 --> 01:02:50,029
- Whose name did you use? - Whose name?

1787
01:02:50,794 --> 01:02:52,524
- Yang Se Chan. - It's hard to make...

1788
01:02:52,525 --> 01:02:54,163
an acrostic poem with my initials.

1789
01:02:54,164 --> 01:02:55,623
- Should I prompt you? - Okay.

1790
01:02:55,624 --> 01:02:56,734
Y.

1791
01:02:56,735 --> 01:02:58,069
Yes, I want to eat lamb skewers.

1792
01:02:59,135 --> 01:03:00,163
S.

1793
01:03:00,164 --> 01:03:01,279
Say, I want to eat it three times.

1794
01:03:02,164 --> 01:03:03,174
C.

1795
01:03:03,175 --> 01:03:04,380
Carefully, I will chew.

1796
01:03:04,535 --> 01:03:08,373
Why did she only get an hour of sleep?

1797
01:03:08,374 --> 01:03:09,449
Seriously.

1798
01:03:10,144 --> 01:03:11,290
The thing is,

1799
01:03:11,314 --> 01:03:13,583
I prepared a series about eating.

1800
01:03:13,584 --> 01:03:14,643
A series about eating.

1801
01:03:14,644 --> 01:03:17,853
Sihyeon, it's time to see the real deal.

1802
01:03:17,854 --> 01:03:19,589
- Let's go with Jee Seok Jin. - J.

1803
01:03:19,655 --> 01:03:21,500
- J. - Jeez, I am hungry right now.

1804
01:03:22,155 --> 01:03:23,600
- S. - S.

1805
01:03:24,095 --> 01:03:26,400
Seok Jin, did you eat?

1806
01:03:26,454 --> 01:03:28,163
- There you go. - She called him by his name.

1807
01:03:28,164 --> 01:03:29,623
- This is good. - I know.

1808
01:03:29,624 --> 01:03:30,710
J.

1809
01:03:31,294 --> 01:03:32,509
Just tell me if you did.

1810
01:03:33,564 --> 01:03:35,964
- The impromptu one is better. - This one is better.

1811
01:03:35,965 --> 01:03:37,310
The impromptu one is better.

1812
01:03:37,635 --> 01:03:39,873
- That was funny. - Good job.

1813
01:03:39,874 --> 01:03:42,844
Since Sihyeon gave us acrostic poems,

1814
01:03:42,845 --> 01:03:45,013
Seok Jin will return the favor...

1815
01:03:45,014 --> 01:03:46,513
- as the representative of the show. - That's right.

1816
01:03:46,514 --> 01:03:47,889
Give us one with HyunA.

1817
01:03:48,044 --> 01:03:49,114
- HyunA? - Yes.

1818
01:03:49,115 --> 01:03:51,860
- H. - HyunA released a new song.

1819
01:03:52,814 --> 01:03:54,384
- A. - Ah,

1820
01:03:54,385 --> 01:03:56,000
I don't remember it.

1821
01:03:57,425 --> 01:04:01,500
(Seok Jin showed a bad example of an acrostic poem.)

1822
01:04:01,595 --> 01:04:02,793
He failed.

1823
01:04:02,794 --> 01:04:03,940
(He failed.)

1824
01:04:04,535 --> 01:04:06,094
He failed to make a decent acrostic poem.

1825
01:04:06,095 --> 01:04:07,464
(He failed to make people laugh too.)

1826
01:04:07,465 --> 01:04:09,603
I couldn't think of anything.

1827
01:04:09,604 --> 01:04:11,774
Kwang Soo, you should give us one.

1828
01:04:11,775 --> 01:04:13,904
"Tazza".

1829
01:04:13,905 --> 01:04:15,203
Are we still bringing up "Tazza"?

1830
01:04:15,204 --> 01:04:16,449
(It's on VOD now.)

1831
01:04:16,544 --> 01:04:18,774
- What? - You won't let him forget.

1832
01:04:18,775 --> 01:04:20,020
"Tazza" is the last thing I want to hear about.

1833
01:04:20,485 --> 01:04:22,159
- Z. - Zip it.

1834
01:04:24,255 --> 01:04:26,029
See? That's funny.

1835
01:04:26,184 --> 01:04:27,254
"Zip it."

1836
01:04:27,255 --> 01:04:28,384
Let's hear another one.

1837
01:04:28,385 --> 01:04:29,424
- Another one? - Yes.

1838
01:04:29,425 --> 01:04:31,830
- Se Chan, do one with HyunA. - I can't.

1839
01:04:31,854 --> 01:04:33,900
- H. - Hey, who is the prettiest idol?

1840
01:04:34,294 --> 01:04:35,770
- A. - Ah, it's Irene.

1841
01:04:37,764 --> 01:04:39,339
You are right.

1842
01:04:39,365 --> 01:04:40,433
Okay, okay.

1843
01:04:40,434 --> 01:04:42,333
Someone make an acrostic poem with Han Na.

1844
01:04:42,334 --> 01:04:43,674
Se Chan, give us one.

1845
01:04:43,675 --> 01:04:44,810
- H. - Go, Se Chan.

1846
01:04:45,704 --> 01:04:46,844
Let's go.

1847
01:04:46,845 --> 01:04:48,380
- H. - Han Seok Kyu.

1848
01:04:48,845 --> 01:04:50,190
- N. - Na Young Seok.

1849
01:04:52,014 --> 01:04:53,683
- That was funny. - Good job.

1850
01:04:53,684 --> 01:04:54,813
That was a good one.

1851
01:04:54,814 --> 01:04:57,630
- He is good at this! - Seriously.

1852
01:04:58,014 --> 01:05:00,460
- He is good at acrostic poems. - His poems catch you off-guard.

1853
01:05:00,485 --> 01:05:01,929
- That was funny. - That was nice.

1854
01:05:02,184 --> 01:05:04,353
Why are there so many things hanging?

1855
01:05:04,354 --> 01:05:05,969
This is scary.

1856
01:05:06,055 --> 01:05:07,594
It has been a while since I played this game.

1857
01:05:07,595 --> 01:05:09,123
This one hurts.

1858
01:05:09,124 --> 01:05:10,493
This round is the last chance...

1859
01:05:10,494 --> 01:05:12,694
the forbidden animals can do the mission.

1860
01:05:12,695 --> 01:05:14,710
Otherwise, they will be eliminated.

1861
01:05:14,934 --> 01:05:16,933
- They will be eliminated. - They must be anxious.

1862
01:05:16,934 --> 01:05:19,179
- This must be nerve-wracking. - Who is nervous?

1863
01:05:19,934 --> 01:05:21,980
- Look at him. - Kwang Soo is too quiet.

1864
01:05:22,005 --> 01:05:24,114
He isn't saying much today.

1865
01:05:24,115 --> 01:05:26,543
I am confident it's Kwang Soo.

1866
01:05:26,544 --> 01:05:29,484
I hope you wouldn't misunderstand.

1867
01:05:29,485 --> 01:05:30,960
Kwang Soo isn't good at talking.

1868
01:05:31,655 --> 01:05:32,913
Kwang Soo isn't good at talking.

1869
01:05:32,914 --> 01:05:34,159
(The fool)

1870
01:05:34,724 --> 01:05:36,993
What can he do well?

1871
01:05:36,994 --> 01:05:39,493
He can do slapstick comedy well. He can't talk well.

1872
01:05:39,494 --> 01:05:40,623
He isn't very witty.

1873
01:05:40,624 --> 01:05:42,339
(The master of slapstick comedy)

1874
01:05:42,794 --> 01:05:46,594
The second mission for a hint is Yes or No, Answer Me.

1875
01:05:46,595 --> 01:05:48,310
- Yes or No? - Yes or No, Answer Me.

1876
01:05:48,405 --> 01:05:49,904
There will be 10 rounds in total.

1877
01:05:49,905 --> 01:05:53,920
In each round, six members will play.

1878
01:05:54,044 --> 01:05:56,243
If you succeed once in 10 rounds,

1879
01:05:56,244 --> 01:05:59,049
all 12 members will receive a hint on the forbidden animals.

1880
01:05:59,414 --> 01:06:00,690
Here are the rules.

1881
01:06:00,914 --> 01:06:03,214
The production crew will give you a category...

1882
01:06:03,215 --> 01:06:04,714
with a "Like" or "Dislike".

1883
01:06:04,715 --> 01:06:06,723
If it's "Like", pick a word that fits the category.

1884
01:06:06,724 --> 01:06:09,453
If it's "Dislike", pick a word that doesn't fit the category.

1885
01:06:09,454 --> 01:06:11,154
Let's say I said, "I like Korean food."

1886
01:06:11,155 --> 01:06:13,330
Then you can answer, "Kimchi stew I like."

1887
01:06:13,394 --> 01:06:15,393
- How about "Dislike"? - Let's say I said,

1888
01:06:15,394 --> 01:06:16,833
"I dislike Korean food."

1889
01:06:16,834 --> 01:06:19,194
Then you can answer, "Pasta I dislike."

1890
01:06:19,195 --> 01:06:20,480
Okay, okay.

1891
01:06:20,505 --> 01:06:21,739
- I got it. - Spaghetti.

1892
01:06:21,764 --> 01:06:25,274
Please pick three teams for the first round.

1893
01:06:25,275 --> 01:06:27,850
(Team Pig, Team Fox, and Team Snake)

1894
01:06:27,874 --> 01:06:29,944
We will watch you like hawks.

1895
01:06:29,945 --> 01:06:31,520
This isn't a difficult game.

1896
01:06:31,575 --> 01:06:33,619
It would be strange to make a mistake.

1897
01:06:33,785 --> 01:06:35,284
We should suspect anyone who makes a mistake.

1898
01:06:35,285 --> 01:06:38,429
I am not a forbidden animal, but I could make a mistake.

1899
01:06:38,584 --> 01:06:39,614
No, no.

1900
01:06:39,615 --> 01:06:41,524
Don't make excuses.

1901
01:06:41,525 --> 01:06:43,953
A mistake means that person is a forbidden animal.

1902
01:06:43,954 --> 01:06:45,223
- Let's go. - It means that person is a fool.

1903
01:06:45,224 --> 01:06:47,069
1, 2, 3, 4.

1904
01:06:47,095 --> 01:06:50,234
Yes or no, answer me

1905
01:06:50,235 --> 01:06:51,763
I like Korean food

1906
01:06:51,764 --> 01:06:53,540
Kimchi stew I like

1907
01:06:54,465 --> 01:06:56,734
(Since it's "Like", Jae Seok chose something that fits the category.)

1908
01:06:56,735 --> 01:06:58,150
I dislike Western food

1909
01:06:58,175 --> 01:06:59,833
Pasta I like

1910
01:06:59,834 --> 01:07:00,904
It's "Dislike".

1911
01:07:00,905 --> 01:07:02,504
Pasta I like

1912
01:07:02,505 --> 01:07:04,119
- It's "Dislike". - "Dislike"!

1913
01:07:04,144 --> 01:07:05,214
Will all of them get hit?

1914
01:07:05,215 --> 01:07:06,444
(She should have answered, "Such-and-such I dislike.")

1915
01:07:06,445 --> 01:07:07,743
- All of us got hit. - I am sorry.

1916
01:07:07,744 --> 01:07:09,219
- But... - Only HyunA should get hit.

1917
01:07:09,345 --> 01:07:10,790
- HyunA, this is... - HyunA.

1918
01:07:11,014 --> 01:07:13,554
If it's "Dislike", you need to say...

1919
01:07:13,555 --> 01:07:14,723
what you dislike.

1920
01:07:14,724 --> 01:07:15,784
- HyunA. - Yes?

1921
01:07:15,785 --> 01:07:17,754
If the producer says what he dislikes, do the same.

1922
01:07:17,755 --> 01:07:20,163
- It's not up to you. - Hold on.

1923
01:07:20,164 --> 01:07:22,563
I might like what the producer dislikes.

1924
01:07:22,564 --> 01:07:25,194
(I might like what the producer dislikes.)

1925
01:07:25,195 --> 01:07:27,710
- It's a rule. - It's not like that.

1926
01:07:27,865 --> 01:07:30,610
PSY, HyunA has a way with words.

1927
01:07:30,635 --> 01:07:31,750
It's a rule.

1928
01:07:32,075 --> 01:07:33,234
If it's "Dislike", say what you dislike.

1929
01:07:33,235 --> 01:07:35,504
- Repeat that part. - Let's begin.

1930
01:07:35,505 --> 01:07:38,774
- Yes or no, answer me - Yes or no, answer me

1931
01:07:38,775 --> 01:07:40,219
I like Chinese food

1932
01:07:40,345 --> 01:07:41,913
Yusanseul I like

1933
01:07:41,914 --> 01:07:43,384
I dislike tropical fruits

Apple I dislike

1935
01:07:45,454 --> 01:07:46,659
It's right.

1936
01:07:47,084 --> 01:07:48,460
I like beverages

1937
01:07:48,684 --> 01:07:50,799
Coca-Cola I like

1938
01:07:50,894 --> 01:07:51,993
He is acting strange.

1939
01:07:51,994 --> 01:07:53,223
I dislike desserts

1940
01:07:53,224 --> 01:07:54,869
Yukgaejang I dislike

1941
01:07:55,925 --> 01:07:57,810
(Seok Jin passed without a problem.)

1942
01:07:58,195 --> 01:07:59,534
(Only HyunA and Jae Seok remain!)

1943
01:07:59,535 --> 01:08:01,310
They are almost done.

1944
01:08:01,465 --> 01:08:02,864
I dislike Korean movies

1945
01:08:02,865 --> 01:08:05,350
"Tazza: One-Eyed Jacks" I dislike

1946
01:08:05,735 --> 01:08:07,743
("Tazza: One-Eyed Jacks" I dislike)

1947
01:08:07,744 --> 01:08:08,980
Hey!

1948
01:08:09,505 --> 01:08:11,389
She is acting strange!

1949
01:08:11,445 --> 01:08:13,784
- You just dislike the movie, right? - HyunA.

1950
01:08:13,785 --> 01:08:15,319
She looked at me when she said it.

1951
01:08:15,684 --> 01:08:16,853
HyunA, what are you doing?

1952
01:08:16,854 --> 01:08:19,589
- She looked at me when she said it. - HyunA.

1953
01:08:21,124 --> 01:08:23,284
(When the producer said his line,)

1954
01:08:23,285 --> 01:08:25,124
(she stared at Kwang Soo.)

1955
01:08:25,125 --> 01:08:27,164
(She stared at Kwang Soo when she said it.)

1956
01:08:27,165 --> 01:08:29,324
(Furious)

1957
01:08:29,325 --> 01:08:31,133
- She said it so confidently. - HyunA.

1958
01:08:31,134 --> 01:08:32,294
I mean...

1959
01:08:32,295 --> 01:08:34,704
- She shouldn't have annoyed me. - My goodness.

1960
01:08:34,705 --> 01:08:36,103
Did I do something wrong?

1961
01:08:36,104 --> 01:08:37,509
Did I do something wrong?

1962
01:08:37,804 --> 01:08:39,503
Why did you star in that movie?

1963
01:08:39,504 --> 01:08:40,673
Was it wrong of me to star in that movie?

1964
01:08:40,674 --> 01:08:42,143
Why did you star in that movie?

1965
01:08:42,144 --> 01:08:43,379
I mean...

1966
01:08:43,445 --> 01:08:45,744
Why did you star in that great movie?

1967
01:08:45,745 --> 01:08:47,160
What are you saying?

1968
01:08:47,184 --> 01:08:50,289
PSY would be proud when he watches the show.

1969
01:08:50,314 --> 01:08:51,454
- What? - PSY.

1970
01:08:51,455 --> 01:08:52,883
That was hilarious.

1971
01:08:52,884 --> 01:08:54,324
The first round was a failure.

1972
01:08:54,325 --> 01:08:55,584
- Will you switch the players? - Let's switch.

1973
01:08:55,585 --> 01:08:57,154
- Let's switch. - Let's switch.

1974
01:08:57,155 --> 01:08:58,253
- Let's switch. - The other teams can go.

1975
01:08:58,254 --> 01:09:00,494
- I don't know. - It isn't easy. It's confusing.

1976
01:09:00,495 --> 01:09:02,063
I don't know about HyunA.

1977
01:09:02,064 --> 01:09:03,893
Once you sit there,

1978
01:09:03,894 --> 01:09:06,440
you will become a fool.

1979
01:09:06,665 --> 01:09:08,509
- You aren't a fool. - You sound like a fool now.

1980
01:09:08,604 --> 01:09:11,280
You will have that experience.

1981
01:09:11,434 --> 01:09:13,374
- Okay. - Can Se Chan go first?

1982
01:09:13,375 --> 01:09:14,620
- Should I start from Se Chan? - Why?

1983
01:09:14,644 --> 01:09:16,120
- Why? - Start from that side.

1984
01:09:16,205 --> 01:09:17,690
- Have Se Chan go first. - What should we do?

1985
01:09:17,915 --> 01:09:19,350
I want to see how Se Chan and Ji Hyo do.

1986
01:09:19,514 --> 01:09:20,713
Let's start from Se Chan.

1987
01:09:20,714 --> 01:09:21,883
You missed the way...

1988
01:09:21,884 --> 01:09:23,929
So Min leaned forward to see you, right?

1989
01:09:24,014 --> 01:09:25,013
(I want to see Se Chan.)

1990
01:09:25,014 --> 01:09:26,999
(Winking)

1991
01:09:27,025 --> 01:09:28,084
For goodness' sake!

1992
01:09:28,085 --> 01:09:29,984
(Se Chan, take my love.)

1993
01:09:29,985 --> 01:09:31,230
What was that?

1994
01:09:31,525 --> 01:09:33,324
- He took a blow. - It was a critical blow.

1995
01:09:33,325 --> 01:09:34,963
- He took a blow. - Seriously.

1996
01:09:34,964 --> 01:09:36,600
- I got a bruise. - He took a blow.

1997
01:09:36,625 --> 01:09:38,694
- Let's begin. - Please give us an easy one.

1998
01:09:38,695 --> 01:09:41,763
- Yes or no, answer me - Yes or no, answer me

1999
01:09:41,764 --> 01:09:43,364
I like amphibians

2000
01:09:43,365 --> 01:09:45,303
Penguins I like

2001
01:09:45,304 --> 01:09:46,973

Penguins I like

2003
01:09:48,905 --> 01:09:50,544
- Hey. - Hey.

2004
01:09:50,545 --> 01:09:52,950
(Penguins are amphibians?)

2005
01:09:53,275 --> 01:09:54,860
You don't know what amphibians are.

2006
01:09:54,945 --> 01:09:56,544
- Frogs. - What is it?

2007
01:09:56,545 --> 01:09:58,053
- Frogs are amphibians. - Frogs.

2008
01:09:58,054 --> 01:09:59,484
Like frogs.

2009
01:09:59,485 --> 01:10:01,324
I thought it was fish.

2010
01:10:01,325 --> 01:10:03,753
- I thought it was fish. - He thought it was fish.

2011
01:10:03,754 --> 01:10:04,753
I thought it was fish.

2012
01:10:04,754 --> 01:10:07,164
He doesn't know what amphibians are.

2013
01:10:07,165 --> 01:10:08,563
Why did you give him a difficult one?

2014
01:10:08,564 --> 01:10:11,534
- Jong Kook. - He doesn't know what they are.

2015
01:10:11,535 --> 01:10:13,664
- Why? - I didn't know.

2016
01:10:13,665 --> 01:10:14,780
Don't be suspicious of me.

2017
01:10:14,804 --> 01:10:16,334
- I didn't know. - By the way, Ji Hyo.

2018
01:10:16,335 --> 01:10:18,079
- Yes. - He saved you.

2019
01:10:18,304 --> 01:10:19,334
(Thanks, Se Chan.)

2020
01:10:19,335 --> 01:10:22,603
- Yes or no, answer me - Yes or no, answer me

2021
01:10:22,604 --> 01:10:24,213
I like comedians

Lee Kwang Soo I like

2023
01:10:25,945 --> 01:10:27,789
(Lee Kwang Soo I like)

2024
01:10:28,415 --> 01:10:29,683
- He's correct. - He's correct.

2025
01:10:29,684 --> 01:10:31,984
- Why not? - I was correct.

2026
01:10:31,985 --> 01:10:33,753
- He was right. - He has two occupations.

2027
01:10:33,754 --> 01:10:35,730
- He's right. - He's a comedian and actor.

2028
01:10:36,224 --> 01:10:38,353
If Kwang Soo approves it, we'll give it to him.

2029
01:10:38,354 --> 01:10:40,770
- Approve what? - You have to approve it.

2030
01:10:40,795 --> 01:10:42,563
Kwang Soo is a comedian.

2031
01:10:42,564 --> 01:10:43,893
You can go from an actor to a comedian.

2032
01:10:43,894 --> 01:10:45,393
Are you embarrassed to be a comedian?

2033
01:10:45,394 --> 01:10:47,864
I paid your dues for several months.

2034
01:10:47,865 --> 01:10:49,133
My dues?

2035
01:10:49,134 --> 01:10:50,433
Approve it!

2036
01:10:50,434 --> 01:10:51,574
- Approve. - Approve.

2037
01:10:51,575 --> 01:10:53,103
That didn't count.

2038
01:10:53,104 --> 01:10:54,544
It's controversial, so we won't count it.

2039
01:10:54,545 --> 01:10:56,350
- He's a comedian. - Just approve.

2040
01:10:56,844 --> 01:10:58,843
- Imagine if the edge falls on you. - It'll be so painful.

2041
01:10:58,844 --> 01:11:00,444
It'll be really bad if it falls vertically.

2042
01:11:00,445 --> 01:11:02,084
Hold on.

2043
01:11:02,085 --> 01:11:03,544
- Hold on. - This is worrying.

2044
01:11:03,545 --> 01:11:04,853
Hold on.

2045
01:11:04,854 --> 01:11:07,683
(As they get more fearful, their concentration increases.)

2046
01:11:07,684 --> 01:11:08,853
Go now.

2047
01:11:08,854 --> 01:11:09,923
(Calm down, trays.)

2048
01:11:09,924 --> 01:11:10,994
Let's go.

2049
01:11:10,995 --> 01:11:12,799
Let's start from Haha again.

2050
01:11:12,955 --> 01:11:16,494
- Yes or no, answer me - Yes or no, answer me

2051
01:11:16,495 --> 01:11:18,034
I dislike actors

2052
01:11:18,035 --> 01:11:20,139
Lee Kwang Soo I dislike

2053
01:11:20,964 --> 01:11:22,839
(Lee Kwang Soo I dislike)

2054
01:11:23,335 --> 01:11:24,450
He's right.

2055
01:11:24,474 --> 01:11:26,303
- Because he's a comedian. - Haha's right.

2056
01:11:26,304 --> 01:11:27,904
- Because Kwang Soo's a comedian. - He's right.

2057
01:11:27,905 --> 01:11:29,303
- He's a comedian. - Right, he's an actor.

2058
01:11:29,304 --> 01:11:30,643
Haha knew.

2059
01:11:30,644 --> 01:11:32,013
Let me go again.

2060
01:11:32,014 --> 01:11:34,414
- I'm getting suspicious. - That was too obvious.

2061
01:11:34,415 --> 01:11:36,284
- Start with Se Chan. - Let's go with Se Chan.

2062
01:11:36,285 --> 01:11:37,584
- Let's start with you. - Give me an easy one.

2063
01:11:37,585 --> 01:11:40,829
- Yes or no, answer me - Yes or no, answer me

2064
01:11:40,924 --> 01:11:42,383
I like foreign masterminds

2065
01:11:42,384 --> 01:11:43,799
I...

2066
01:11:44,594 --> 01:11:46,169
- What? - I don't...

2067
01:11:46,254 --> 01:11:48,164
(I...)

2068
01:11:48,165 --> 01:11:49,463
(Incorrect)

2069
01:11:49,464 --> 01:11:51,234
You always say Bell.

2070
01:11:51,235 --> 01:11:53,593
Hold on. He's serious. Look at his face.

2071
01:11:53,594 --> 01:11:56,209
- Goodness. - Look at his face. He's serious.

2072
01:11:56,335 --> 01:11:58,034
Who are the foreign masterminds?

2073
01:11:58,035 --> 01:11:59,803
- Thomas Edison. - Thomas Edison.

2074
01:11:59,804 --> 01:12:01,850
- Marie Curie. - There are so many.

2075
01:12:02,275 --> 01:12:03,914
He asked who foreign masterminds are.

2076
01:12:03,915 --> 01:12:04,944
Foreign masterminds.

2077
01:12:04,945 --> 01:12:06,643
Come on. We can't get past two people.

2078
01:12:06,644 --> 01:12:10,614
Let's watch Ji Hyo. Her fans are waiting.

2079
01:12:10,615 --> 01:12:13,484
- I'm a fan of hers during quizzes. - Me too.

2080
01:12:13,485 --> 01:12:14,730
During quizzes.

2081
01:12:15,085 --> 01:12:16,553
Let's start.

2082
01:12:16,554 --> 01:12:17,900
I have to get this right.

2083
01:12:17,924 --> 01:12:19,530
- Let's go. - Okay.

2084
01:12:19,625 --> 01:12:22,463

2087
01:12:25,564 --> 01:12:26,933
I dislike desserts

2088
01:12:26,934 --> 01:12:29,110
Coffee I dislike

2089
01:12:29,764 --> 01:12:31,534
(Coffee I dislike)

2090
01:12:31,535 --> 01:12:33,774
- What? - Coffee's dessert.

2091
01:12:33,775 --> 01:12:35,404
- You can have it as a meal. - Gosh, Ji Hyo.

2092
01:12:35,405 --> 01:12:37,513
- You can have it as a meal. - I have coffee as a meal.

2093
01:12:37,514 --> 01:12:39,313
I mix rice with coffee.

2094
01:12:39,314 --> 01:12:41,414
- Stop it, Ji Hyo. - I have coffee with soju.

2095
01:12:41,415 --> 01:12:42,990
Stop it, Ji Hyo.

2096
01:12:43,585 --> 01:12:44,713
A really easy one then.

2097
01:12:44,714 --> 01:12:46,154
- A really easy one. - Just one more time.

2098
01:12:46,155 --> 01:12:48,129
- I'm serious. - What's easier than a dessert?

2099
01:12:48,455 --> 01:12:50,183
I have desserts as my meal.

2100
01:12:50,184 --> 01:12:51,294
Let's go again.

2101
01:12:51,295 --> 01:12:54,563
- Yes or no, answer me - Yes or no, answer me

2102
01:12:54,564 --> 01:12:56,100
I like fish

2103
01:12:56,195 --> 01:12:57,440
Freshwater fish

2104
01:12:58,035 --> 01:12:59,034
I like

2105
01:12:59,035 --> 01:13:00,839
Freshwater fish I like

2106
01:13:02,205 --> 01:13:04,503
(Fish and freshwater fish?)

2107
01:13:04,504 --> 01:13:05,650
What?

2108
01:13:06,634 --> 01:13:09,303
- Name a fish. - I don't know any.

2109
01:13:09,304 --> 01:13:10,843
You have to name one type.

2110
01:13:10,844 --> 01:13:12,473
Isn't she worse than me?

2111
01:13:12,474 --> 01:13:14,143
- She's amazing. - I can't believe this.

2112
01:13:14,144 --> 01:13:15,643
There's tuna!

2113
01:13:15,644 --> 01:13:18,614
I thought the producer was being too nice.

2114
01:13:18,615 --> 01:13:20,984
- He was being nice to her. - She's worse than me.

2115
01:13:20,985 --> 01:13:23,084
- Freshwater fish. - I was right.

2116
01:13:23,085 --> 01:13:24,954
- She was so lovely. - Freshwater fish is fish.

2117
01:13:24,955 --> 01:13:26,154
- Mackerels. - Fine.

2118
01:13:26,155 --> 01:13:27,694
I wish you were a spy!

2119
01:13:27,695 --> 01:13:29,923
(I wish you were a spy!)

2120
01:13:29,924 --> 01:13:31,310
She has to be a spy.

2121
01:13:31,964 --> 01:13:33,393
Please. She has to be one.

2122
01:13:33,394 --> 01:13:35,933
- You have to be a spy, Ji Hyo. - I'm sorry.

2123
01:13:35,934 --> 01:13:37,749
Make sure you change the spy to her right now.

2124
01:13:38,205 --> 01:13:39,850
We have to save Ji Hyo.

2125
01:13:40,405 --> 01:13:42,520
Chul Min, save Ji Hyo.

2126
01:13:43,045 --> 01:13:45,143
- Freshwater fish I like - Freshwater fish

2127
01:13:45,144 --> 01:13:46,713
(This is the new catchphrase.)

2128
01:13:46,714 --> 01:13:49,084
That's all I could remember.

2129
01:13:49,085 --> 01:13:51,154
- Ji Hyo, I'm a fan of yours! - HyunA.

2130
01:13:51,155 --> 01:13:53,730
This is your main commodity.

2131
01:13:54,354 --> 01:13:55,423
Okay, Ji Hyo?

2132
01:13:55,424 --> 01:13:57,694
Watch the fish. I mean, watch Gook Ju.

2133
01:13:57,695 --> 01:13:59,230
"Watch the fish."

2134
01:13:59,695 --> 01:14:02,139
Please be the spy!

2135
01:14:02,325 --> 01:14:04,133
- Let's get it right this time. - We can't get past two people.

2136
01:14:04,134 --> 01:14:06,294
- We need the hint. - Yes, let's get the hint.

2137
01:14:06,295 --> 01:14:07,463
Let's start.

2138
01:14:07,464 --> 01:14:08,763
Good luck, Kwak Do Won!

2139
01:14:08,764 --> 01:14:09,803
(That was random.)

2140
01:14:09,804 --> 01:14:10,973
(Let's do this.)

2141
01:14:10,974 --> 01:14:12,633
- Kwak Do Won. - Good luck, Han Ki Bum.

2142
01:14:12,634 --> 01:14:13,633
Good luck, Noh Joo Hyun.

2143
01:14:13,634 --> 01:14:14,843
Good luck, Lee Moon Sae.

2144
01:14:14,844 --> 01:14:16,219
- Good luck, Han Moo. - Good luck, Han Ki Bum.

2145
01:14:16,245 --> 01:14:17,444
Good luck, everybody!

2146
01:14:17,445 --> 01:14:18,589
Let's start.

2147
01:14:18,745 --> 01:14:21,944
- Yes or no, answer me - Yes or no, answer me

2148
01:14:21,945 --> 01:14:23,484
I like people with mustaches

2149
01:14:23,485 --> 01:14:25,154
Kim Heung Gook I like

2150
01:14:25,155 --> 01:14:26,614
I dislike spicy food

2151
01:14:26,615 --> 01:14:27,824
Water I like

2152
01:14:27,825 --> 01:14:29,024
- It's dislike. - You idiot.

2153
01:14:29,025 --> 01:14:30,154
Dislike.

2154
01:14:30,155 --> 01:14:31,353
- Hey. - Isn't he weird?

2155
01:14:31,354 --> 01:14:32,753
- He's weird. - I didn't do it on purpose.

2156
01:14:32,754 --> 01:14:35,700
- He told me all the answers. - That was too obvious.

2157
01:14:35,964 --> 01:14:37,234
- Then... - I don't think it's him.

2158
01:14:37,235 --> 01:14:38,593
We failed round two.

2159
01:14:38,594 --> 01:14:40,194
- You should say, "Water I dislike". - Leave these two.

2160
01:14:40,195 --> 01:14:41,503
- Leave these two. - Switch us.

2161
01:14:41,504 --> 01:14:43,133
Leave these. Go, HyunA.

2162
01:14:43,134 --> 01:14:44,973
- Go, HyunA. And Han Na. - HyunA and Han Na.

2163
01:14:44,974 --> 01:14:46,734
Do you know the rules, HyunA? Do you understand?

2164
01:14:46,735 --> 01:14:48,079
I understand the rules,

2165
01:14:48,275 --> 01:14:49,480
but I can't do it.

2166
01:14:50,405 --> 01:14:52,143
This is a minefield.

2167
01:14:52,144 --> 01:14:54,620
- She's honest. - This is a war.

2168
01:14:55,415 --> 01:14:56,484
Let's go.

2169
01:14:56,485 --> 01:14:57,553
(They only have 3 chances left.)

2170
01:14:57,554 --> 01:15:00,414
- Yes or no, answer me - Yes or no, answer me

2171
01:15:00,415 --> 01:15:01,683
I dislike birds

2172
01:15:01,684 --> 01:15:03,629
Frogs I dislike

2173
01:15:03,684 --> 01:15:05,100
I dislike amphibians

2174
01:15:05,224 --> 01:15:07,270
Fish I dislike

2175
01:15:08,125 --> 01:15:09,524
She's driving me nuts.

2176
01:15:09,525 --> 01:15:10,633
What fish?

2177
01:15:10,634 --> 01:15:11,994
- Eagles. - Say it.

2178
01:15:11,995 --> 01:15:13,063
Eagles.

2179
01:15:13,064 --> 01:15:14,503
What does fish have to do with this?

2180
01:15:14,504 --> 01:15:16,339
Are you enemies with fish?

2181
01:15:16,934 --> 01:15:18,009
She's a spy.

2182
01:15:18,035 --> 01:15:19,904
I'm sure.

2183
01:15:19,905 --> 01:15:21,850
- She's a spy, Haha. - She has to be a spy.

2184
01:15:21,974 --> 01:15:23,749
Are you doing your mission?

2185
01:15:23,945 --> 01:15:25,114
This...

2186
01:15:25,115 --> 01:15:26,450
I can't trust her.

2187
01:15:27,144 --> 01:15:28,484
There has to be at least one out of them.

2188
01:15:28,485 --> 01:15:30,044
There has to be. I'm sure.

2189
01:15:30,045 --> 01:15:31,160
Do you want to switch? Do you want to go first?

2190
01:15:31,254 --> 01:15:33,013
Okay. Let's switch.

2191
01:15:33,014 --> 01:15:34,253
- Do you want to go first? - What?

2192
01:15:34,254 --> 01:15:35,984
- Do you want to switch? - No.

2193
01:15:35,985 --> 01:15:37,593
(Se Chan tries to move back.)

2194
01:15:37,594 --> 01:15:39,154
Try it.

2195
01:15:39,155 --> 01:15:40,499
You'll be good.

2196
01:15:41,094 --> 01:15:43,563
I'm suspicious of Han Na, so I want her here.

2197
01:15:43,564 --> 01:15:46,209
There's no point switching. It won't come this far.

2198
01:15:47,064 --> 01:15:48,734
Ji Hyo is on my right.

2199
01:15:48,735 --> 01:15:49,864
Why would you switch seats?

2200
01:15:49,865 --> 01:15:50,904
(There's no point in switching.)

2201
01:15:50,905 --> 01:15:52,334
I didn't even get to say a thing.

2202
01:15:52,335 --> 01:15:53,603
You never know.

2203
01:15:53,604 --> 01:15:54,719
(You never know.)

2204
01:15:54,804 --> 01:15:56,079
That was sharp.

2205
01:15:57,075 --> 01:15:59,244
I don't like Haha sitting there.

2206
01:15:59,245 --> 01:16:00,313
Why? Don't you get it?

2207
01:16:00,314 --> 01:16:01,883
Stop pretending like you know everything.

2208
01:16:01,884 --> 01:16:03,383
Should we switch Haha in for Han Na?

2209
01:16:03,384 --> 01:16:04,454
Switch out Han Na.

2210
01:16:04,455 --> 01:16:05,454
- Come here. - Haha.

2211
01:16:05,455 --> 01:16:06,513
- Fine. - You're suspicious.

2212
01:16:06,514 --> 01:16:07,660
Show them.

2213
01:16:08,054 --> 01:16:09,683
- Han Na. - I want to...

2214
01:16:09,684 --> 01:16:11,423
answer quiz questions here.

2215
01:16:11,424 --> 01:16:12,494
Do you want to do it?

2216
01:16:12,495 --> 01:16:13,524
(He's confident.)

2217
01:16:13,525 --> 01:16:14,524
Let's go.

2218
01:16:14,525 --> 01:16:17,664
- Yes or no, answer me - Yes or no, answer me

2219
01:16:17,665 --> 01:16:19,164
I like Korean movies

2220
01:16:19,165 --> 01:16:20,933
"Tazza" I like

2221
01:16:20,934 --> 01:16:22,404
I like cartoons

2222
01:16:22,405 --> 01:16:24,133
"Dodge Danpei" I like

2223
01:16:24,134 --> 01:16:25,774
I dislike birds

2224
01:16:25,775 --> 01:16:27,404
Dolphins I dislike

2225
01:16:27,405 --> 01:16:29,874
(I dislike birds, Dolphins I dislike)

2226
01:16:29,875 --> 01:16:32,690
(She finally passed!)

2227
01:16:33,045 --> 01:16:34,414
I like amphibians

2228
01:16:34,415 --> 01:16:36,313
Frogs I like

2229
01:16:36,314 --> 01:16:37,654
I like hardy plants

2230
01:16:37,655 --> 01:16:38,954
What are hardy plants?

2231
01:16:38,955 --> 01:16:41,053
(What are hardy plants?)

2232
01:16:41,054 --> 01:16:43,284
(He doesn't know what it is.)

2233
01:16:43,285 --> 01:16:45,093
- Sweet potatoes. - Sweet potatoes and potatoes.

2234
01:16:45,094 --> 01:16:46,454
- Sweet potatoes and potatoes. - Sweet potatoes and potatoes.

2235
01:16:46,455 --> 01:16:48,563
- What was that? - You don't know any hardy plants?

2236
01:16:48,564 --> 01:16:50,124
- I was serious. - What's wrong with you?

2237
01:16:50,125 --> 01:16:51,633
- I didn't know. - Did you really not know?

2238
01:16:51,634 --> 01:16:52,893
You were showing off, and you didn't know.

2239
01:16:52,894 --> 01:16:53,893
I'm really sorry.

2240
01:16:53,894 --> 01:16:55,664
- Haha is so dumb. - I'm sorry.

2241
01:16:55,665 --> 01:16:57,334
- I'm sorry. - Don't you learn about this...

2242
01:16:57,335 --> 01:16:59,473
in elementary school? Potatoes and sweet potatoes?

2243
01:16:59,474 --> 01:17:02,520
You weren't even smiling. You were serious.

2244
01:17:02,545 --> 01:17:03,874
"What are hardy plants?"

2245
01:17:03,875 --> 01:17:05,444
I'm really sorry.

2246
01:17:05,445 --> 01:17:07,614
- Were you serious? - I'll go one last time.

2247
01:17:07,615 --> 01:17:09,044
Is this the last round?

2248
01:17:09,045 --> 01:17:10,683
- Last. - Last one.

2249
01:17:10,684 --> 01:17:12,213
Let's start with HyunA.

2250
01:17:12,214 --> 01:17:15,423
- Yes or no, answer me - Yes or no, answer me

2251
01:17:15,424 --> 01:17:16,923
I like carnivores

2252
01:17:16,924 --> 01:17:18,624
Hippos I like

2253
01:17:18,625 --> 01:17:19,654
(I like carnivores, Hippos I like)

2254
01:17:19,655 --> 01:17:21,370
- She's right. - Hippos are carnivores.

2255
01:17:21,594 --> 01:17:23,093
I dislike herbivores

2256
01:17:23,094 --> 01:17:24,940
Tigers I dislike

2257
01:17:25,134 --> 01:17:26,433
I like birds

2258
01:17:26,434 --> 01:17:28,364
Mackerels I like

2259
01:17:28,365 --> 01:17:29,534
(I like birds, Mackerels I like)

2260
01:17:29,535 --> 01:17:31,704
(Mackerels are birds?)

2261
01:17:31,705 --> 01:17:33,303
- Birds. - Birds!

2262
01:17:33,304 --> 01:17:35,744
- Birds. - Birds. Flying birds.

2263
01:17:35,745 --> 01:17:37,303
- That was really odd. - Birds.

2264
01:17:37,304 --> 01:17:39,013
- That was really... - What are flying creatures?

2265
01:17:39,014 --> 01:17:40,114
Birds.

2266
01:17:40,115 --> 01:17:42,560
(He finally realizes.)

2267
01:17:43,514 --> 01:17:45,089
I can't watch this anymore.

2268
01:17:45,155 --> 01:17:46,654
- I know. - I can't watch.

2269
01:17:46,655 --> 01:17:48,253
Hey, you're this bad,

2270
01:17:48,254 --> 01:17:50,900
and you say all sorts of things to your junior comedians.

2271
01:17:50,955 --> 01:17:52,553
I didn't know he was this dumb.

2272
01:17:52,554 --> 01:17:54,593
- I thought I misheard. - I was nervous.

2273
01:17:54,594 --> 01:17:56,669
He's unbelievable.

2274
01:17:56,825 --> 01:18:00,463
So you won't be getting the hint on the forbidden animal.

2275
01:18:00,464 --> 01:18:01,933
- We did pretty well though. - I feel dejected.

2276
01:18:01,934 --> 01:18:03,003
They succeeded.

2277
01:18:03,004 --> 01:18:05,904
Let's have Ji Hyo and Se Chan compete next time.

2278
01:18:05,905 --> 01:18:07,473
Ji Hyo and Se Chan...

2279
01:18:07,474 --> 01:18:08,673
- will be close. - They have to be spies.

2280
01:18:08,674 --> 01:18:11,673
I'm still very confused, so can we share the hints?

2281
01:18:11,674 --> 01:18:13,013
- Do it. - Tell us.

2282
01:18:13,014 --> 01:18:14,013
Tell us.

2283
01:18:14,014 --> 01:18:15,784
- We should do this together. - Let's share.

2284
01:18:15,785 --> 01:18:16,843
Hurry. I know.

2285
01:18:16,844 --> 01:18:18,230
The forbidden animal...

2286
01:18:18,354 --> 01:18:20,353
lives in a herd.

2287
01:18:20,354 --> 01:18:21,484
On water?

2288
01:18:21,485 --> 01:18:22,784
(The forbidden animal lives in a herd?)

2289
01:18:22,785 --> 01:18:25,230
- On water? - They live in herds.

2290
01:18:25,724 --> 01:18:26,794
Okay, let's look at the hint.

2291
01:18:26,795 --> 01:18:27,794
(They got the hint at the end of round 1.)

2292
01:18:27,795 --> 01:18:29,494
- Do we check it together? - Yes.

2293
01:18:29,495 --> 01:18:31,393
(The forbidden animal lives in a herd.)

2294
01:18:31,394 --> 01:18:32,834
Then...

2295
01:18:32,835 --> 01:18:34,440
I'm narrowing down now.

2296
01:18:35,035 --> 01:18:36,440
- Hold on. - Jong Kook.

2297
01:18:36,464 --> 01:18:37,980
It's not a tiger.

2298
01:18:38,134 --> 01:18:40,133
(The forbidden animal lives in a herd.)

2299
01:18:40,134 --> 01:18:42,780
- Pigs and foxes. - Rabbits too.

2300
01:18:43,304 --> 01:18:44,944
- What about snakes? - I'm sure about pigs.

2301
01:18:44,945 --> 01:18:46,744
- Boars live in herds too. - Boars.

2302
01:18:46,745 --> 01:18:48,160
That's true.

2303
01:18:48,745 --> 01:18:50,383
Rabbits and foxes.

2304
01:18:50,384 --> 01:18:53,213
(Are rabbit, pig, and fox left?)

2305
01:18:53,214 --> 01:18:55,324
- All right. - Got it.

2306
01:18:55,325 --> 01:18:56,883
(Thanks to the first hint, they narrowed down a lot.)

2307
01:18:56,884 --> 01:18:59,154
- Bear... What were we again? - Tiger and snake.

2308
01:18:59,155 --> 01:19:00,154
- Snake. Tiger. - Tiger is out.

2309
01:19:00,155 --> 01:19:01,664
Lions live in herds but not tigers.

2310
01:19:01,665 --> 01:19:02,900
It's everybody except those.

2311
01:19:03,365 --> 01:19:06,694
- Pig, rabbit, or fox. - It's 1 of those 3.

2312
01:19:06,695 --> 01:19:08,704
- Pig, rabbit, or fox? - Yes.

2313
01:19:08,705 --> 01:19:10,973
- Rabbit, fox, or pig. - It's not me.

2314
01:19:10,974 --> 01:19:13,204
- I swear. - Watch her carefully.

2315
01:19:13,205 --> 01:19:14,704
Watch her carefully.

2316
01:19:14,705 --> 01:19:15,904
(Is So Min the forbidden animal like everybody thinks?)

2317
01:19:15,905 --> 01:19:17,404
I swear it's not me.

2318
01:19:17,405 --> 01:19:19,143
It could be Haha too.

2319
01:19:19,144 --> 01:19:20,774
- What are you? - It's not me.

2320
01:19:20,775 --> 01:19:22,713
- I'm a tiger. - It's not us.

2321
01:19:22,714 --> 01:19:24,753
- It's not you. - It narrows down to six people.

2322
01:19:24,754 --> 01:19:27,429
If it's not you guys, you really got the questions wrong.

2323
01:19:27,825 --> 01:19:28,923
- I faked it. - Jae Seok.

2324
01:19:28,924 --> 01:19:30,024
- Did you fake it? - I faked it.

2325
01:19:30,025 --> 01:19:31,294
Fish...

2326
01:19:31,295 --> 01:19:32,494
- Jae Seok. - No?

2327
01:19:32,495 --> 01:19:34,164
- I didn't. - We help them.

2328
01:19:34,165 --> 01:19:37,494
So Ji Hyo is not the bad animal?

2329
01:19:37,495 --> 01:19:38,810
She's not.

2330
01:19:39,134 --> 01:19:40,494
- She's not, HyunA. - Hey.

2331
01:19:40,495 --> 01:19:42,579
- She got it wrong. - See me after we finish here.

2332
01:19:42,934 --> 01:19:44,334
Don't leave after we finish today.

2333
01:19:44,335 --> 01:19:45,834
- I can't let this slide. - Oh, no. Goodness.

2334
01:19:45,835 --> 01:19:46,834
- You stay behind today. - My gosh.

2335
01:19:46,835 --> 01:19:49,704
All right. We'll move onto the final race.

2336
01:19:49,705 --> 01:19:51,673
I told you earlier that if the forbidden animals...

2337
01:19:51,674 --> 01:19:54,219
can't carry out the hidden mission, they'll be eliminated.

2338
01:19:54,844 --> 01:19:56,643
- They must have failed. - Really?

2339
01:19:56,644 --> 01:19:59,360
- I guess they succeeded. - Both of forbidden animals...

2340
01:19:59,415 --> 01:20:00,553
executed their hidden mission.

2341
01:20:00,554 --> 01:20:01,753
- Really? - They did it.

2342
01:20:01,754 --> 01:20:03,954
- When? - We don't know that.

2343
01:20:03,955 --> 01:20:05,429
Ji Hyo, what did you do?

2344
01:20:05,525 --> 01:20:06,723
It's not Ji Hyo.

2345
01:20:06,724 --> 01:20:08,164
- Ji Hyo. - My gosh, Seok Jin.

2346
01:20:08,165 --> 01:20:09,294
- Gosh, Ji Hyo. - My focus is on you today.

2347
01:20:09,295 --> 01:20:11,234
She looks so suspicious, but it's not her?

2348
01:20:11,235 --> 01:20:13,294
- We'll go to the final destination. - Let's go.

2349
01:20:13,295 --> 01:20:14,410
They did the mission?

2350
01:20:16,304 --> 01:20:19,749
(Which one of them is the forbidden animal?)

2351
01:20:20,735 --> 01:20:21,944
(A series of strange incidents...)

2352
01:20:21,945 --> 01:20:23,850
(keeps confusing the animals.)

2353
01:20:24,575 --> 01:20:27,044
(Is something wrong with today's race?)

2354
01:20:27,045 --> 01:20:29,683
(The forbidden animal is lurking around to eliminate them.)

2355
01:20:29,684 --> 01:20:30,713
I'm sorry.

2356
01:20:30,714 --> 01:20:33,114
(The moment they are eliminated one at a time,)

2357
01:20:33,115 --> 01:20:35,230
(the hidden truth is unraveled.)

2358
01:20:35,525 --> 01:20:38,230
(And the members of the Running Man must be informed of this story.)

2359
01:20:38,695 --> 01:20:40,829
(Late at night, editing room at SBS)

2360
01:20:40,995 --> 01:20:43,423
(Did you tell the new producer about the ghost story?)

2361
01:20:43,424 --> 01:20:46,034
(How could I tell her when she just joined our show?)

2362
01:20:46,035 --> 01:20:48,234
(You don't know the ghost story of our TV station, SBS, right?)

2363
01:20:48,235 --> 01:20:49,664
(It's my first time hearing it.)

2364
01:20:49,665 --> 01:20:51,473
(You don't know about Clacking Ghost and Coughing Ghost?)

2365
01:20:51,474 --> 01:20:52,574
(No, I don't.)

2366
01:20:52,575 --> 01:20:54,320
(Listen.)

2367
01:20:54,875 --> 01:20:57,044
(A long time ago, a main producer and an assistant director...)

2368
01:20:57,045 --> 01:21:00,574
(wrote a legendary proposal that guaranteed 40 percent TV ratings.)

2369
01:21:00,575 --> 01:21:04,530
(Another competing producer and a writer were envious of them.)

2370
01:21:05,485 --> 01:21:09,129
(One night, the competition producer and the writer eliminated them.)

2371
01:21:10,325 --> 01:21:14,463
(But the producer was Coughing Ghost because the producer coughed a lot.)

2372
01:21:14,464 --> 01:21:17,910
(The writer was Clacking Ghost because the writer wore high heels.)

2373
01:21:18,634 --> 01:21:20,433
(And after they had gotten eliminated,)

2374
01:21:20,434 --> 01:21:22,704
(every night,)

2375
01:21:22,705 --> 01:21:26,334
(there were clacking and coughing sounds.)

2376
01:21:26,335 --> 01:21:29,120
(They are roaming around the building to find that proposal.)

2377
01:21:29,644 --> 01:21:32,614
(Didn't you guys twist the story too much?)

2378
01:21:32,615 --> 01:21:34,660
(Let's just go home.)

2379
01:21:41,554 --> 01:21:46,429
(Ghost Story of a TV Station: Legendary Proposal)
