00:00:05,402 --> 00:00:06,401
(Previously on Running Man)

2
00:00:06,402 --> 00:00:08,647
- Please come on out. - Hello.

3
00:00:10,072 --> 00:00:12,417
- It's Hyun A. - See?

4
00:00:13,012 --> 00:00:14,317
It's been so long.

5
00:00:14,512 --> 00:00:16,212
Today, six couples of animals will participate in today's race.

6
00:00:16,213 --> 00:00:18,157
It's called the Mysterious Animal Farm Race.

7
00:00:18,422 --> 00:00:22,521
There are two forbidden animals who destroyed the farm.

8
00:00:22,522 --> 00:00:23,761
- Forbidden animals? - There are two...

9
00:00:23,762 --> 00:00:24,962
- forbidden animals. - Two?

10
00:00:24,963 --> 00:00:27,491
- Can you move a bit to the side? - All right.

11
00:00:27,492 --> 00:00:29,831
- Team Bear and Team Snake. - Okay. We did it.

12
00:00:29,832 --> 00:00:31,002
- We got it. - We did it.

13
00:00:31,003 --> 00:00:33,907
- We'll check it together, right? - Yes. One team at a time.

14
00:00:34,942 --> 00:00:36,047
What?

15
00:00:36,603 --> 00:00:37,672
Hold on.

16
00:00:37,673 --> 00:00:39,947
- Pig. - It's not snake then.

17
00:00:40,372 --> 00:00:42,812
- Snakes... - Do tigers live in packs?

18
00:00:42,813 --> 00:00:44,587
No, they don't.

19
00:00:45,353 --> 00:00:46,611
- Bear. - It can't be tiger.

20
00:00:46,612 --> 00:00:49,322
- It's not tiger. - It's 1 of these 3 teams.

21
00:00:49,323 --> 00:00:50,998
Then, they are among these six people.

22
00:00:51,253 --> 00:00:52,902
- Rabbit, pig, and fox? - It's not me.

23
00:00:52,903 --> 00:00:55,412
The last mission to fish out the forbidden animals...

24
00:00:55,413 --> 00:00:57,139
is Find Hidden Animals.

25
00:00:57,140 --> 00:00:59,149
- What? - I guess they are hidden.

26
00:00:59,150 --> 00:01:01,879
Hints about the forbidden animals are hidden all over the building.

27
00:01:01,880 --> 00:01:03,355
- There are hints. - Yes.

28
00:01:03,450 --> 00:01:07,149
If you find the forbidden animals and eliminate them, you'll win.

29
00:01:07,150 --> 00:01:08,819
Oppositely, if the animals get all eliminated,

30
00:01:08,820 --> 00:01:10,564
the forbidden animals will win.

31
00:01:10,889 --> 00:01:13,365
The losing team will face a penalty.

32
00:01:13,459 --> 00:01:17,328
However, if you eliminate an animal, not a forbidden animal,

33
00:01:17,329 --> 00:01:18,944
both of the animals will be eliminated.

34
00:01:19,270 --> 00:01:20,868
Some of us should go around in groups.

35
00:01:20,869 --> 00:01:22,699
- What if one of them is it? - But it's hard to eliminate...

36
00:01:22,700 --> 00:01:23,999
all of us when there are only 2...

37
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,245
All right. Be quiet. So...

38
00:01:26,769 --> 00:01:28,239
Why do you let him treat you like this?

39
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:29,739
- It's driving me crazy. - Why do you let him?

40
00:01:29,740 --> 00:01:32,508
It's driving me crazy. This is why we'll lose today.

41
00:01:32,509 --> 00:01:34,054
We'll lose because I didn't speak up.

42
00:01:35,150 --> 00:01:38,349
And if you are eliminated by the forbidden animals,

43
00:01:38,350 --> 00:01:41,088
that area in the building will get closed off.

44
00:01:41,089 --> 00:01:43,518
(An area will get closed.)

45
00:01:43,519 --> 00:01:45,628
All the hints in the area will be removed,

46
00:01:45,629 --> 00:01:49,429
and if you step into the area, you'll be eliminated. So be careful.

47
00:01:49,430 --> 00:01:51,828
(When both their feet are in the area, they'll be eliminated.)

48
00:01:51,829 --> 00:01:54,198
So if I push someone into it, that person will get eliminated?

49
00:01:54,199 --> 00:01:55,669
- Yes. - My gosh.

50
00:01:55,670 --> 00:01:58,498
- My gosh, that's scary. - I shouldn't even go near that.

51
00:01:58,499 --> 00:02:01,269
In addition, there is a special DVD rental shop and a library...

52
00:02:01,270 --> 00:02:03,914
where you can enter whenever you want.

53
00:02:04,540 --> 00:02:05,649
At the DVD rental shop,

54
00:02:05,650 --> 00:02:07,748
there will be several DVDs with animals.

55
00:02:07,749 --> 00:02:09,718
After choosing a DVD,

56
00:02:09,719 --> 00:02:11,948
you can play a scene of your choice for one minute.

57
00:02:11,949 --> 00:02:13,748
- One minute? - You'll find out...

58
00:02:13,749 --> 00:02:16,159
if the forbidden animals are in the scene you chose.

59
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:17,218
(They'll find out whether or not if there are forbidden animals.)

60
00:02:17,219 --> 00:02:19,629
- They're giving us a lot of hints. - If you chose, the movie "Babe",

61
00:02:19,630 --> 00:02:21,858
and if there are pigs in the scene you watched for a minute,

62
00:02:21,859 --> 00:02:24,599
you'll either see an O or an X if it's a forbidden animal.

63
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:25,998
- Really? - We'll let you know.

64
00:02:25,999 --> 00:02:27,668
With the letters? They're telling us everything.

65
00:02:27,669 --> 00:02:28,668
That's great.

66
00:02:28,669 --> 00:02:31,799
However, each couple gets only one chance to rent a DVD.

67
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:32,838
One chance?

68
00:02:32,839 --> 00:02:35,308
And only one person can enter.

69
00:02:35,309 --> 00:02:37,338
- That's hard. - I'll go in.

70
00:02:37,339 --> 00:02:38,579
- Why? - What?

71
00:02:38,580 --> 00:02:40,879
- I'll know for sure. - As for the library,

72
00:02:40,880 --> 00:02:43,349
everyone will get one chance to enter.

73
00:02:43,350 --> 00:02:45,748
If you win the mission against the mission-keeper,

74
00:02:45,749 --> 00:02:48,088
you'll obtain a hint about the forbidden animals.

75
00:02:48,089 --> 00:02:52,464
Before you head to your own spots, I'll give out the rental ticket.

76
00:02:52,889 --> 00:02:55,659
There's only one rental ticket for one couple?

77
00:02:55,660 --> 00:02:57,405
- It's for the DVDs. - Each couple gets only one?

78
00:02:58,100 --> 00:03:00,169
Han Na, you should hold onto it.

79
00:03:00,170 --> 00:03:02,674
- Sihyeon, you watch the DVD. - I'll hold onto it.

80
00:03:02,700 --> 00:03:04,399
- Look. Everyone is yielding. - Everyone is yielding.

81
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:06,509
Everyone gave it to their partners. You're the only one who didn't.

82
00:03:06,510 --> 00:03:07,669
- Give it to me. - Let's play rock-paper-scissors.

83
00:03:07,670 --> 00:03:09,139
Why won't you give it to me? Give it to me if you're not it.

84
00:03:09,140 --> 00:03:10,878
Rock-paper-scissors

85
00:03:10,879 --> 00:03:11,984
Okay.

86
00:03:12,450 --> 00:03:14,549
- I'll hold onto it. - I don't feel safe about this.

87
00:03:14,550 --> 00:03:16,149
- There's 2 out of the 6, right? - Right.

88
00:03:16,150 --> 00:03:19,248
- Why didn't So Min make a guess? - Two of the animals are it.

89
00:03:19,249 --> 00:03:20,949
We should suspect So Min too.

90
00:03:20,950 --> 00:03:23,818
Once you go to your own spot, we'll begin the race.

91
00:03:23,819 --> 00:03:25,058
Yes. Okay.

92
00:03:25,059 --> 00:03:26,729
(The race begins once they go to their spot.)

93
00:03:26,730 --> 00:03:28,998
- Seok Jin. - Gook Ju.

94
00:03:28,999 --> 00:03:30,359
I doubt that it's you, right?

95
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:32,998
- It's not me. - I couldn't trust you that day.

96
00:03:32,999 --> 00:03:34,305
It's really not me.

97
00:03:34,529 --> 00:03:35,699
I'm sure it's Han Na though.

98
00:03:35,700 --> 00:03:37,498
- She is, right? - She came early, you know.

99
00:03:37,499 --> 00:03:38,808
What's your animal? Are you a pig?

100
00:03:38,809 --> 00:03:40,239
(Blurting it out)

101
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:41,239
- No, Seok Jin. - You're...

102
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:42,979
- You're a tiger. - It's so obvious I'm a tiger.

103
00:03:42,980 --> 00:03:44,984
- How could you say I'm a pig? - I'm sorry.

104
00:03:45,039 --> 00:03:46,748
You're unbelievable.

105
00:03:46,749 --> 00:03:48,818
It clearly says I'm a tiger. Can't you read?

106
00:03:48,819 --> 00:03:49,979
- I'm sorry. - It clearly says...

107
00:03:49,980 --> 00:03:51,818
- "tiger" here. Seok Jin. - I'm sorry, Gook Jin.

108
00:03:51,819 --> 00:03:53,348
- You heard me roar earlier. - I'm sorry.

109
00:03:53,349 --> 00:03:54,588
- I'm sorry. - Do you know what he said to me?

110
00:03:54,589 --> 00:03:56,058
It's her. I was suspecting her.

111
00:03:56,059 --> 00:03:58,558
He asked if I was a pig as soon as he saw me.

112
00:03:58,559 --> 00:04:00,158
- But he read my badge. - No.

113
00:04:00,159 --> 00:04:02,259
I'm sorry. That's not true.

114
00:04:02,260 --> 00:04:05,574
Actually, HyunA from Team Pig looks very suspicious.

115
00:04:05,830 --> 00:04:07,305
It's odd that she's deceiving us.

116
00:04:07,830 --> 00:04:09,375
She was acting strange earlier.

117
00:04:09,569 --> 00:04:11,975
I really have a bad feeling about So Min.

118
00:04:12,770 --> 00:04:14,808
I really have a bad feeling about her.

119
00:04:14,809 --> 00:04:19,049
It's either Jae Seok and Han Na or Seok Jin and HyunA.

120
00:04:19,050 --> 00:04:21,079
(So Min is suspecting Jae Seok, Han Na, Seok Jin, and HyunA.)

121
00:04:21,080 --> 00:04:23,248
Today, Jae Seok has been awfully quiet.

122
00:04:23,249 --> 00:04:25,565
Jae Seok seems suspicious today too.

123
00:04:27,420 --> 00:04:29,218
My gosh, I'm not sure about HyunA either.

124
00:04:29,219 --> 00:04:31,658
It's HyunA. Something about her feels off.

125
00:04:31,659 --> 00:04:34,335
There's no way she really didn't understand that game.

126
00:04:34,659 --> 00:04:38,998
(HyunA, the prime suspect, is suspecting Jae Seek and Han Na.)

127
00:04:38,999 --> 00:04:40,074
Right?

128
00:04:40,999 --> 00:04:43,598
(I found bad animals. They're probably my partner and Han Na.)

129
00:04:43,599 --> 00:04:45,944
Let the race begin.

130
00:04:46,039 --> 00:04:48,338
(The race to find 2 hidden, forbidden animals will begin soon.)

131
00:04:48,339 --> 00:04:51,085
3, 2, 1.

132
00:04:51,339 --> 00:04:54,755
Start the race.

133
00:04:55,110 --> 00:04:56,248
Jae Seok.

134
00:04:56,249 --> 00:04:57,854
You look lonely, Jae Seok.

135
00:04:58,480 --> 00:04:59,595
Oink, oink.

136
00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:01,989
(Is So Min starting psychological warfare?)

137
00:05:01,990 --> 00:05:04,294
Didn't I tell you? I'm serious. You are...

138
00:05:04,890 --> 00:05:06,204
Where is he going?

139
00:05:06,230 --> 00:05:08,064
He didn't even turn back.

140
00:05:08,429 --> 00:05:09,835
That's such a skinny pig.

141
00:05:10,299 --> 00:05:11,934
(She's unbelievable.)

142
00:05:12,099 --> 00:05:13,829
My goodness, you're ridiculous.

143
00:05:13,830 --> 00:05:15,129
(Following only after Jae Seok)

144
00:05:15,130 --> 00:05:16,374
You startled me.

145
00:05:17,339 --> 00:05:18,645
Why do you keep following me?

146
00:05:18,870 --> 00:05:20,314
I'm looking for Haha.

147
00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:23,254
So we can go to the DVD cafe.

148
00:05:24,010 --> 00:05:26,249
No, it's not a DVD cafe. I meant a DVD rental shop.

149
00:05:26,250 --> 00:05:28,184
I'm sorry. That's not what I meant.

150
00:05:28,650 --> 00:05:30,924
Why did they name it like that?

151
00:05:31,049 --> 00:05:33,249
- So we can watch the DVD. - Is that so?

152
00:05:33,250 --> 00:05:35,319
- No, we'll rent the DVD. - All of a sudden,

153
00:05:35,320 --> 00:05:36,488
you caught me by surprise.

154
00:05:36,489 --> 00:05:38,588
(She's looking for Haha to get the hint at the DVD rental shop.)

155
00:05:38,589 --> 00:05:39,829
Haha.

156
00:05:39,830 --> 00:05:42,275
HyunA and I need to go together. Where did she go?

157
00:05:44,359 --> 00:05:46,374
(Engrossed in the race)

158
00:05:46,830 --> 00:05:50,145
(Filming a spy movie all by herself)

159
00:05:50,839 --> 00:05:55,309
(Everyone, be quiet. I'm really serious right now.)

160
00:05:55,310 --> 00:05:56,908
- That's HyunA. - She's the most suspicious one...

161
00:05:56,909 --> 00:05:58,809
- because... - Yes, her behaviors are suspicious.

162
00:05:58,810 --> 00:06:01,225
HyunA is the most suspected member from Team Pig.

163
00:06:01,450 --> 00:06:03,949
As soon as she saw me, she rushed to me from the opposite side.

164
00:06:03,950 --> 00:06:05,895
You're the most suspicious one.

165
00:06:06,219 --> 00:06:07,288
Come here, HyunA.

166
00:06:07,289 --> 00:06:09,658
Why do you think Han Na is it? Tell me why you think it's her.

167
00:06:09,659 --> 00:06:11,189
Don't try to get my name tag.

168
00:06:11,190 --> 00:06:12,804
I won't do it. I'm not it.

169
00:06:13,260 --> 00:06:14,804
HyunA, it's not me.

170
00:06:16,130 --> 00:06:18,228
(She hides behind the door to avoid Haha.)

171
00:06:18,229 --> 00:06:19,405
Hey!

172
00:06:19,870 --> 00:06:21,075
HyunA!

173
00:06:21,299 --> 00:06:22,468
Where did she go?

174
00:06:22,469 --> 00:06:23,769
- HyunA. - It's HyunA.

175
00:06:23,770 --> 00:06:25,098
HyunA, it's not me.

176
00:06:25,099 --> 00:06:26,908
- She went inside. - I'm so scared.

177
00:06:26,909 --> 00:06:28,044
HyunA.

178
00:06:28,109 --> 00:06:29,478
- Come out and just talk. - Hey.

179
00:06:29,479 --> 00:06:30,939
This isn't how you play this.

180
00:06:30,940 --> 00:06:32,449
You should still film the show.

181
00:06:32,450 --> 00:06:33,649
- HyunA. - Go away!

182
00:06:33,650 --> 00:06:34,649
I'm not it.

183
00:06:34,650 --> 00:06:37,124
- We won't rip your name tag off. - I know that you're not it.

184
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:39,494
- I know that you're not it. - Okay.

185
00:06:39,989 --> 00:06:41,249
But it's Han Na.

186
00:06:41,250 --> 00:06:42,689
Why? Tell me why it's her.

187
00:06:42,690 --> 00:06:44,434
- Starting from the opening segment, - Okay.

188
00:06:44,989 --> 00:06:47,965
she kept lying that Kwang Soo was the forbidden animal.

189
00:06:48,190 --> 00:06:49,928
I wasn't lying. Kwang Soo seemed suspicious.

190
00:06:49,929 --> 00:06:53,504
Actually, she's a terrible detective.

191
00:06:53,630 --> 00:06:55,798
- Haha. - Everyone knows how awful she is.

192
00:06:55,799 --> 00:06:57,499
Haha, you need to be careful.

193
00:06:57,500 --> 00:06:59,484
You might get eliminated if you let your guard down.

194
00:07:00,570 --> 00:07:02,778
Come out and talk to us. We won't rip off your name tag.

195
00:07:02,779 --> 00:07:04,085
Let's just talk.

196
00:07:04,109 --> 00:07:05,278
- Haha. - Listen.

197
00:07:05,279 --> 00:07:07,379
See? Han Na is totally obsessing over me.

198
00:07:07,380 --> 00:07:08,509
Right?

199
00:07:08,510 --> 00:07:11,218
(How did the conversation get to this point?)

200
00:07:11,219 --> 00:07:12,418
- I can't believe this. - Why is HyunA hiding?

201
00:07:12,419 --> 00:07:14,548
HyunA, you won't really die from it. So come on out.

202
00:07:14,549 --> 00:07:17,734
Kwang Soo, eliminate Han Na first!

203
00:07:18,159 --> 00:07:19,288
(Speechless)

204
00:07:19,289 --> 00:07:20,959
- I mean... - You're not going to die.

205
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:23,098
- Don't get into the role too much. - Let's talk once you come out.

206
00:07:23,099 --> 00:07:25,874
- This isn't a movie or a drama. - I mean...

207
00:07:26,469 --> 00:07:28,629
- Please. That's not it. - Why do you think it's Han Na?

208
00:07:28,630 --> 00:07:30,439
- Tell me once HyunA is out. - Please Haha.

209
00:07:30,440 --> 00:07:32,544
Please believe me.

210
00:07:32,609 --> 00:07:33,885
HyunA, Han Na is gone.

211
00:07:33,940 --> 00:07:35,885
What are you doing there? Why are you hiding there?

212
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:37,608
No, if I'm eliminated,

213
00:07:37,609 --> 00:07:40,548
I won't get any airtime on the show.

214
00:07:40,549 --> 00:07:42,794
Hey, we're not playing mafia. We're not it.

215
00:07:42,950 --> 00:07:45,195
- Did Han Na leave? - Yes. She left.

216
00:07:46,320 --> 00:07:47,988
(She unlocks the door.)

217
00:07:47,989 --> 00:07:49,119
- She left. - What's happening?

218
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:51,465
- No, get up. - You don't have to go that far.

219
00:07:51,989 --> 00:07:53,158
- She left. - She really left.

220
00:07:53,159 --> 00:07:55,088
- Did you get her name tag? - No, we didn't.

221
00:07:55,089 --> 00:07:56,775
Why didn't you remove her name tag?

222
00:07:56,799 --> 00:07:58,228
There's no definite proof.

223
00:07:58,229 --> 00:08:00,228
- If she's not it... - I'm 100 percent sure.

224
00:08:00,229 --> 00:08:01,674
My gut tells me she is it.

225
00:08:01,900 --> 00:08:04,275
I don't think you're good at these games.

226
00:08:05,099 --> 00:08:06,645
This is your first time playing it.

227
00:08:06,940 --> 00:08:07,939
I'm serious.

228
00:08:07,940 --> 00:08:10,079
You weren't good at the game with the tray.

229
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:12,314
There's nothing to talk about with these two fools.

230
00:08:13,880 --> 00:08:15,449
- In my opinion, HyunA... - HyunA.

231
00:08:15,450 --> 00:08:17,079
- She's a prime suspect now. - She wasn't on my suspect list.

232
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:19,048
Same here. But she just got on my list.

233
00:08:19,049 --> 00:08:20,649
(HyunA is on their suspect list.)

234
00:08:20,650 --> 00:08:23,095
- Are you suspecting me now? - Yes.

235
00:08:24,390 --> 00:08:26,104
You don't want to talk to me, right?

236
00:08:26,830 --> 00:08:27,988
HyunA.

237
00:08:27,989 --> 00:08:29,658
(Communication is cut off.)

238
00:08:29,659 --> 00:08:31,699
- It's been a while, right? - Seriously.

239
00:08:31,700 --> 00:08:33,304
It's been a while since someone locked the door.

240
00:08:35,229 --> 00:08:37,414
It's been a while since I got goosebumps during a race.

241
00:08:37,969 --> 00:08:40,515
This just brought back old memories. I'm thinking about the old days.

242
00:08:42,109 --> 00:08:43,354
HyunA.

243
00:08:44,140 --> 00:08:46,285
- Kwang Soo. - Yes?

244
00:08:46,510 --> 00:08:47,684
Where are you going?

245
00:08:47,779 --> 00:08:48,854
Over there.

246
00:08:49,179 --> 00:08:50,278
To find a hint?

247
00:08:50,279 --> 00:08:51,649
(Dashing)

248
00:08:51,650 --> 00:08:52,825
What is it? What?

249
00:08:53,690 --> 00:08:54,749
What is it?

250
00:08:54,750 --> 00:08:56,595
(Where did Kwang Soo rush to?)

251
00:08:56,989 --> 00:08:58,459
As for the library,

252
00:08:58,460 --> 00:09:00,858
everyone will get one chance to enter.

253
00:09:00,859 --> 00:09:03,329
If you win the mission against the mission-keeper,

254
00:09:03,330 --> 00:09:05,604
you will get a hint about the forbidden animals.

255
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:08,428
- Wait, this place is... Hello. - Hi.

256
00:09:08,429 --> 00:09:10,269
- I'm Onda of EVERGLOW. - Hello.

257
00:09:10,270 --> 00:09:12,399
- Hello. - You're in EVERGLOW too.

258
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:15,885
- You'll play a game with me today. - Okay.

259
00:09:15,909 --> 00:09:17,285
You can choose a book.

260
00:09:17,310 --> 00:09:18,709
This is completely random.

261
00:09:18,710 --> 00:09:20,385
(This is completely random.)

262
00:09:20,849 --> 00:09:21,949
Did you choose one?

263
00:09:21,950 --> 00:09:23,095
I chose...

264
00:09:23,179 --> 00:09:24,325
this book.

265
00:09:25,049 --> 00:09:27,764
This game might be about how many people are on a page.

266
00:09:28,289 --> 00:09:29,994
It's very likely that it might be that game.

267
00:09:30,520 --> 00:09:32,989
"Winning" by Jack Welch.

268
00:09:32,990 --> 00:09:34,658
(Kwang Soo chose a book as he wishes for a win.)

269
00:09:34,659 --> 00:09:36,205
- So you can win? - Yes.

270
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:41,068
(He draws a piece of paper to pick a game.)

271
00:09:41,069 --> 00:09:44,215
"Lift the book with your toes. The one that lasts longer wins."

272
00:09:44,699 --> 00:09:46,568
Actually, I have the most powerful toes...

273
00:09:46,569 --> 00:09:48,239
- among the members. - Really?

274
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:50,438
We played a toe-wrestling match once.

275
00:09:50,439 --> 00:09:52,185
And I won.

276
00:09:53,150 --> 00:09:56,578
(Thick)

277
00:09:56,579 --> 00:09:59,465
(Falling)

278
00:10:00,819 --> 00:10:02,425
This is too heavy for me to lift.

279
00:10:03,919 --> 00:10:05,195
This is like a dumbbell.

280
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:11,428
(Dropping it again)

281
00:10:11,429 --> 00:10:14,168
(Is his chance of winning getting slim?)

282
00:10:14,169 --> 00:10:15,644
Hold on. I'm sorry. Wait.

283
00:10:15,699 --> 00:10:17,345
- We'll start once you're ready. - Okay.

284
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:18,499
Wait.

285
00:10:18,500 --> 00:10:19,845
(Getting his toes ready once again)

286
00:10:20,809 --> 00:10:21,938
All right.

287
00:10:21,939 --> 00:10:23,139
(At last)

288
00:10:23,140 --> 00:10:25,284
In 1, 2, 3.

289
00:10:25,309 --> 00:10:26,984
(The game starts.)

290
00:10:29,919 --> 00:10:31,778
(It's a close match.)

291
00:10:31,779 --> 00:10:33,065
Isn't this hard?

292
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:35,935
Gosh, your toes are really strong.

293
00:10:36,490 --> 00:10:37,695
It hurts so much!

294
00:10:38,159 --> 00:10:39,805
My toe muscles hurt like crazy!

295
00:10:40,429 --> 00:10:43,604
(Why did you choose a thick book?)

296
00:10:43,699 --> 00:10:44,975
I want to give up!

297
00:10:47,299 --> 00:10:49,298
(In the end,)

298
00:10:49,299 --> 00:10:51,538
(he didn't win at all.)

299
00:10:51,539 --> 00:10:52,708
Are you all right?

300
00:10:52,709 --> 00:10:55,609
(His defeat only left him in pain.)

301
00:10:55,610 --> 00:10:57,784
(It hurts so much.)

302
00:11:00,209 --> 00:11:01,448
My gosh, it hurts so much.

303
00:11:01,449 --> 00:11:02,448
(Nice try, Rotten Toenails.)

304
00:11:02,449 --> 00:11:05,325
Since you lost the match, you failed to get the hint.

305
00:11:06,319 --> 00:11:08,448
- Seok Jin, let's go watch the DVD. - Yes. Let's go.

306
00:11:08,449 --> 00:11:09,935
The DVD rental shop is over there.

307
00:11:10,020 --> 00:11:11,389
(That's the DVD rental shop.)

308
00:11:11,390 --> 00:11:12,734
- Hello. - Hi.

309
00:11:14,090 --> 00:11:17,698
(There are movies about 6 animals at the DVD rental shop.)

310
00:11:17,699 --> 00:11:20,599
(They can play a scene of their choice for 1 minute.)

311
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:23,445
(They'll know if there are forbidden animals in the scene they chose.)

312
00:11:24,199 --> 00:11:25,614
- Rabbit? - How about this? "Rabbit".

313
00:11:25,669 --> 00:11:27,384
- I like it. - Rabbit is written on it.

314
00:11:27,669 --> 00:11:29,139
- "Rabbit". - Yes, let's check that one.

315
00:11:29,140 --> 00:11:30,438
(They'll check So Min whom Han Na is suspecting.)

316
00:11:30,439 --> 00:11:32,408
Okay. Great. Let's go.

317
00:11:32,409 --> 00:11:34,278
(Only one person can enter the DVD rental shop.)

318
00:11:34,279 --> 00:11:35,524
Hello.

319
00:11:36,520 --> 00:11:37,624
Play the scene...

320
00:11:37,980 --> 00:11:39,864
5 minutes and 10 seconds into the movie.

321
00:11:41,819 --> 00:11:43,734
(The movie plays.)

322
00:11:45,090 --> 00:11:48,565
(Like a movie about rabbits, a rabbit shows up on the screen.)

323
00:11:49,059 --> 00:11:51,499
(Totally focused)

324
00:11:51,500 --> 00:11:53,644
(She gets to play the movie only for 1 minute.)

325
00:11:53,929 --> 00:11:56,675
(She's taking notes in case she misses anything.)

326
00:11:56,970 --> 00:11:58,698
(Meanwhile)

327
00:11:58,699 --> 00:12:00,215
Is this it?

328
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:01,384
Yes, that was it.

329
00:12:01,409 --> 00:12:02,815
You'll get the result now.

330
00:12:03,539 --> 00:12:07,479
(She'll find out if forbidden animals are in the scene she chose.)

331
00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:10,149
(If the forbidden animals came up in the movie, she'll get an O.)

332
00:12:10,150 --> 00:12:12,649
(If the forbidden animals weren't in the movie, she'll get an X.)

333
00:12:12,650 --> 00:12:16,435
(Did the forbidden animals show up in the movie?)

334
00:12:17,059 --> 00:12:20,335
(What is the result? Why is Han Na so surprised?)

335
00:12:20,990 --> 00:12:22,158
Let's shake hands then.

336
00:12:22,159 --> 00:12:24,374
You're really not it. I won't suspect you.

337
00:12:24,730 --> 00:12:25,969
(Is the forbidden animal in Team Rabbit?)

338
00:12:25,970 --> 00:12:27,075
It's really not me either.

339
00:12:27,100 --> 00:12:28,244
Han Na.

340
00:12:28,829 --> 00:12:30,374
It looks like you got a hint.

341
00:12:31,539 --> 00:12:32,639
You got it, right?

342
00:12:32,640 --> 00:12:34,609
(Were the forbidden animals in the movie or not?)

343
00:12:34,610 --> 00:12:36,609
- This is very odd. - What is it? Tell me...

344
00:12:36,610 --> 00:12:37,784
about the forbidden animals.

345
00:12:38,039 --> 00:12:40,009
The screen showed me an O, so the forbidden animals...

346
00:12:40,010 --> 00:12:41,208
were in the movie.

347
00:12:41,209 --> 00:12:42,524
- It was an O? - Yes.

348
00:12:43,220 --> 00:12:44,994
- Then, it's in Team Rabbit. - It's in Team Rabbit.

349
00:12:45,380 --> 00:12:47,065
Then, between So Min and Haha...

350
00:12:48,150 --> 00:12:51,089
It's either So Min or Haha. But I don't t think it's Haha.

351
00:12:51,090 --> 00:12:52,295
- Okay. - Okay.

352
00:12:52,620 --> 00:12:53,889
Someone in Team Rabbit is definitely it.

353
00:12:53,890 --> 00:12:55,489
One of them has to be in Team Rabbit.

354
00:12:55,490 --> 00:12:56,935
(They are certain of it.)

355
00:12:57,159 --> 00:12:58,558
Han Na.

356
00:12:58,559 --> 00:13:00,269
- Aren't you it? - Me?

357
00:13:00,270 --> 00:13:01,644
(She meets other animals in front of the DVD rental shop.)

358
00:13:02,199 --> 00:13:03,644
One of them is in Team Rabbit.

359
00:13:03,870 --> 00:13:05,239
I just got it from the DVD.

360
00:13:05,240 --> 00:13:06,639
- You saw a rabbit? - I did.

361
00:13:06,640 --> 00:13:07,739
What did it say?

362
00:13:07,740 --> 00:13:09,244
I watched "Peter Rabbit".

363
00:13:09,610 --> 00:13:12,685
It said that the forbidden animal was in the movie.

364
00:13:13,750 --> 00:13:15,384
- It's in Team Rabbit. - Team Rabbit.

365
00:13:15,650 --> 00:13:18,325
I'm certain that it's either So Min or Haha.

366
00:13:19,179 --> 00:13:20,519
Since we watched "Peter Rabbit", watch something else.

367
00:13:20,520 --> 00:13:21,894
- Yes, we should. - Watch something else.

368
00:13:22,319 --> 00:13:25,219
(Or could it be that both of them are the forbidden animals?)

369
00:13:25,220 --> 00:13:26,788
- We have to eliminate them, right? - No way.

370
00:13:26,789 --> 00:13:28,658
(Team Fox comes up to the 2nd floor with suspicion against Team Rabbit.)

371
00:13:28,659 --> 00:13:29,805
Hey.

372
00:13:30,199 --> 00:13:31,534
- Then, it must be So Min. - Hey.

373
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:33,599
- Did you check? - I figured out everything.

374
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:34,698
What is it?

375
00:13:34,699 --> 00:13:36,514
(What did he figure out?)

376
00:13:36,840 --> 00:13:37,999
I can tell Kwang Soo.

377
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,408
- Seok Jin, tell me. - I can't tell you.

378
00:13:39,409 --> 00:13:41,038
- We found out something great. - I'm in Team Rabbit.

379
00:13:41,039 --> 00:13:42,239
- What is it? - We should suspect Team Rabbit.

380
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:43,815
- Did you watch the DVD? - Yes, we did.

381
00:13:44,079 --> 00:13:45,715
- Haha. - I'm in Team Rabbit.

382
00:13:45,809 --> 00:13:46,925
I know that.

383
00:13:47,449 --> 00:13:48,509
It must be So Min, right?

384
00:13:48,510 --> 00:13:49,818
- You're on the suspect list. - Does it mean it's not in Team Fox?

385
00:13:49,819 --> 00:13:51,649
We watched "Peter Rabbit".

386
00:13:51,650 --> 00:13:53,389
I sounded like a detective again.

387
00:13:53,390 --> 00:13:54,749
- Wait. Did you watch it together? - Tell us.

388
00:13:54,750 --> 00:13:57,019
- I heard it from her. - That's mine.

389
00:13:57,020 --> 00:13:58,335
But how could you trust her?

390
00:13:58,520 --> 00:14:00,188
She's trustworthy.

391
00:14:00,189 --> 00:14:01,764
Look at her face. She won't lie.

392
00:14:01,829 --> 00:14:03,129
- Seriously? - I actually suspected Seok Jin,

393
00:14:03,130 --> 00:14:04,928
but foxes weren't in the movie.

394
00:14:04,929 --> 00:14:06,099
- Right. - But it was for the rabbits.

395
00:14:06,100 --> 00:14:07,698
- What do you think, Haha? - It was for the rabbits.

396
00:14:07,699 --> 00:14:08,969
- Someone from Team Rabbit? - Tell us.

397
00:14:08,970 --> 00:14:10,244
- It's either you or So Min. - Tell us.

398
00:14:10,270 --> 00:14:11,399
- All right. - Just share a comment.

399
00:14:11,400 --> 00:14:12,438
It's either you or So Min.

400
00:14:12,439 --> 00:14:14,114
(Meanwhile)

401
00:14:14,409 --> 00:14:15,839
Se Chan...

402
00:14:15,840 --> 00:14:17,854
(So Min is observing the other animals' whereabouts.)

403
00:14:17,880 --> 00:14:21,085
(What is So Min doing?)

404
00:14:21,909 --> 00:14:23,479
Everyone, remove my name tag.

405
00:14:23,480 --> 00:14:25,219
- We can't. We can't do that. - Let's all get eliminated.

406
00:14:25,220 --> 00:14:26,619
- We can't. We're not sure. - I think it's So Min.

407
00:14:26,620 --> 00:14:27,948
All right, then. I can...

408
00:14:27,949 --> 00:14:29,489
- Tell us that you're not it. - Tell us what you think.

409
00:14:29,490 --> 00:14:30,665
(Tell us that you're not it if you feel wronged.)

410
00:14:30,860 --> 00:14:32,158
I'll show you with my actions.

411
00:14:32,159 --> 00:14:34,904
I'll go and eliminate So Min.

412
00:14:35,630 --> 00:14:37,129
- Really? - Yes. You'll trust me then, right?

413
00:14:37,130 --> 00:14:39,134
- Okay. - Then, catch her for me.

414
00:14:39,400 --> 00:14:40,399
- Catch So Min? - Catch So Min?

415
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:42,068
- Must we help you that much? - It's not that.

416
00:14:42,069 --> 00:14:43,538
- A long time ago... - You can't do it yourself?

417
00:14:43,539 --> 00:14:44,599
That was so weird.

418
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:45,739
- It was. - We should eliminate him.

419
00:14:45,740 --> 00:14:47,009
- Hey. - What were you talking about?

420
00:14:47,010 --> 00:14:48,969
They were going to lure us in and then eliminate us.

421
00:14:48,970 --> 00:14:50,354
- Do you need our help? - That's not it.

422
00:14:50,740 --> 00:14:52,109
- That's ridiculous. - No.

423
00:14:52,110 --> 00:14:53,778
- Is it both of you? - To be honest,

424
00:14:53,779 --> 00:14:55,284
So Min is not an easy match.

425
00:14:55,650 --> 00:14:56,649
(Is he a forbidden animal?)

426
00:14:56,650 --> 00:14:57,778
It's definitely not me.

427
00:14:57,779 --> 00:14:59,989
I'll prove it to you by eliminating her.

428
00:14:59,990 --> 00:15:02,295
- All right. It's 1 of you 2. - It's either you or her.

429
00:15:02,350 --> 00:15:03,989
Since it isn't me, it's her.

430
00:15:03,990 --> 00:15:05,234
- Okay. - Keep him in check.

431
00:15:06,090 --> 00:15:07,328
(Haha looks for So Min.)

432
00:15:07,329 --> 00:15:08,688
I told them that it's not me.

433
00:15:08,689 --> 00:15:12,099
Your gaze is so strange.

434
00:15:12,100 --> 00:15:13,744
Let's watch a movie together.

435
00:15:14,329 --> 00:15:16,168
I know you're just luring me in.

436
00:15:16,169 --> 00:15:17,938
Where would I lure you to?

437
00:15:17,939 --> 00:15:19,808
- At the DVD place. - Do I look like a spy?

438
00:15:19,809 --> 00:15:21,038
You're going to eliminate me...

439
00:15:21,039 --> 00:15:22,514
- at the DVD rental shop. - Do I look like Jong Kook to you?

440
00:15:23,079 --> 00:15:24,239
What is this?

441
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:25,455
(Kwang Soo and Seok Jin appear.)

442
00:15:25,579 --> 00:15:27,555
- You're a bit... - It's not me.

443
00:15:27,610 --> 00:15:29,555
- It's not you, right? - It's not me.

444
00:15:29,819 --> 00:15:32,965
- If it's not her, it's you. - Rip hers off.

445
00:15:33,289 --> 00:15:34,349
Eliminate her. It's not me.

446
00:15:34,350 --> 00:15:35,818
I told him it was a rabbit, and he said to eliminate you.

447
00:15:35,819 --> 00:15:37,519
- You said... - Eliminate her.

448
00:15:37,520 --> 00:15:39,188
- I... - Eliminate her first.

449
00:15:39,189 --> 00:15:40,828
You should do it.

450
00:15:40,829 --> 00:15:42,028
Okay.

451
00:15:42,029 --> 00:15:43,458
- Because... - Hold on.

452
00:15:43,459 --> 00:15:45,158
- It's one of you. - It's one of you.

453
00:15:45,159 --> 00:15:46,399
- I swear. - So...

454
00:15:46,400 --> 00:15:47,528
- Then... - So...

455
00:15:47,529 --> 00:15:49,469
- I swear. - Listen to me.

456
00:15:49,470 --> 00:15:50,744
I'll do it.

457
00:15:50,770 --> 00:15:52,269
I'll do it if you think it's a rabbit.

458
00:15:52,270 --> 00:15:55,038
- It's either one of you. - It's not me. Darn it.

459
00:15:55,039 --> 00:15:56,639
- It's not me. - It's not me.

460
00:15:56,640 --> 00:15:57,938
- How dare you? - It's not me.

461
00:15:57,939 --> 00:15:59,979
- Hurry, tear it off. - It is you.

462
00:15:59,980 --> 00:16:01,849
- Why aren't you ripping it? - Why aren't you ripping it?

463
00:16:01,850 --> 00:16:02,979
- Come on. - It's not me.

464
00:16:02,980 --> 00:16:04,178
Does this look natural to you?

465
00:16:04,179 --> 00:16:05,778
- It's not me. - Are you sure?

466
00:16:05,779 --> 00:16:06,849
- It's not me. - It's one of you.

467
00:16:06,850 --> 00:16:08,048
- It's not me. - It's not?

468
00:16:08,049 --> 00:16:09,219
- No. - Then it's you, isn't it?

469
00:16:09,220 --> 00:16:10,295
- No. - Then it's you.

470
00:16:11,020 --> 00:16:12,188
- Eliminate her. - I swear.

471
00:16:12,189 --> 00:16:14,158
- Trust me this once. It's not me. - It's her.

472
00:16:14,159 --> 00:16:15,889
If it isn't you, eliminate your partner.

473
00:16:15,890 --> 00:16:17,828
- Grab her arms! - It's not me.

474
00:16:17,829 --> 00:16:19,928
- It's not me. - Why can't you do it?

475
00:16:19,929 --> 00:16:21,399
- Are you going to do it? - It's not me.

476
00:16:21,400 --> 00:16:22,744
He did it.

477
00:16:23,270 --> 00:16:25,099
- It's not me. - He did it.

478
00:16:25,100 --> 00:16:27,068
- Maybe she's telling the truth. - I told you it's not me.

479
00:16:27,069 --> 00:16:28,308
Show me your back.

480
00:16:28,309 --> 00:16:30,114
- It's not me. - It's not her.

481
00:16:30,439 --> 00:16:33,178
(So Min wasn't a forbidden animal.)

482
00:16:33,179 --> 00:16:34,884
- It wasn't her. - It wasn't her.

483
00:16:35,010 --> 00:16:36,519
- It's not me either. - Haha.

484
00:16:36,520 --> 00:16:37,854
(Does that mean he's a forbidden animal?)

485
00:16:38,520 --> 00:16:40,565
(Han Na watched a rabbit movie.)

486
00:16:40,919 --> 00:16:43,619
(After finishing it...)

487
00:16:43,620 --> 00:16:46,528
(She said rabbits were forbidden animals.)

488
00:16:46,529 --> 00:16:48,259
(According to Han Na,)

489
00:16:48,260 --> 00:16:51,558
(Haha is the forbidden animal.)

490
00:16:51,559 --> 00:16:52,629
It's not her.

491
00:16:52,630 --> 00:16:54,904
(What is his identity?)

492
00:16:55,730 --> 00:16:57,975
(Now, it's 100-percent him.)

493
00:16:59,169 --> 00:17:00,339
- Haha is out. - It's a rabbit.

494
00:17:00,340 --> 00:17:01,568
See? It's not me!

495
00:17:01,569 --> 00:17:03,654
(Haha is eliminated as well.)

496
00:17:03,809 --> 00:17:06,685
- It's not him either? - Why did you say it was us?

497
00:17:06,779 --> 00:17:08,509
- Hold on. - I'll tell you who told us.

498
00:17:08,510 --> 00:17:09,994
Han Na saw the DVD.

499
00:17:11,150 --> 00:17:15,349
(Han Na said that there was an O for rabbits.)

500
00:17:15,350 --> 00:17:17,335
(She announced it to everyone.)

501
00:17:17,720 --> 00:17:21,305
(Everyone believed that rabbits were forbidden animals.)

502
00:17:22,230 --> 00:17:26,004
(However, rabbits weren't forbidden animals.)

503
00:17:26,230 --> 00:17:28,068
(The suspicion falls onto Han Na.)

504
00:17:28,069 --> 00:17:29,129
- Who said it? - Han Na.

505
00:17:29,130 --> 00:17:30,445
- Hold on. - Then she lied?

506
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:33,908
One team is gone.

507
00:17:33,909 --> 00:17:36,114
(Was she a forbidden animal herself, trying to eliminate the others?)

508
00:17:36,340 --> 00:17:38,038
- Han Na. - My gosh.

509
00:17:38,039 --> 00:17:39,114
(They feel betrayed.)

510
00:17:39,510 --> 00:17:42,254
Gosh, she's so suspicious.

511
00:17:43,380 --> 00:17:45,925
(Seok Jin goes out to find her.)

512
00:17:46,319 --> 00:17:47,948
(At that moment,)

513
00:17:47,949 --> 00:17:50,935
(some people are tailing him.)

514
00:17:51,819 --> 00:17:54,935
(They are following him.)

515
00:17:55,490 --> 00:17:57,198
(Then suddenly,)

516
00:17:57,199 --> 00:18:01,175
(they make a U-turn.)

517
00:18:02,199 --> 00:18:05,339
(After they're gone...)

518
00:18:05,340 --> 00:18:07,008
Seok Jin is out.

519
00:18:07,009 --> 00:18:08,544
- I'm out? - You're out.

520
00:18:08,669 --> 00:18:09,678
I'm out?

521
00:18:09,679 --> 00:18:11,415
(All of a sudden?)

522
00:18:11,909 --> 00:18:13,855
What did I do?

523
00:18:14,550 --> 00:18:17,395
(Someone has shot his name tag.)

524
00:18:18,019 --> 00:18:19,718
(He has no idea why he's out.)

525
00:18:19,719 --> 00:18:21,195
Was it because I looked back?

526
00:18:21,890 --> 00:18:25,218
Seok Jin is out. Seok Jin is out.

527
00:18:25,219 --> 00:18:28,958
- He's out? - The forbidden animals...

528
00:18:28,959 --> 00:18:30,234
have eliminated him.

529
00:18:30,360 --> 00:18:31,958
The forbidden animals got him?

530
00:18:31,959 --> 00:18:33,768
Seok Jin is out.

531
00:18:33,769 --> 00:18:35,475
I'm so shocked.

532
00:18:36,269 --> 00:18:38,244
There is a closed area.

533
00:18:38,439 --> 00:18:40,584
There is a closed area.

534
00:18:41,239 --> 00:18:44,408
(If any animals are eliminated by the forbidden animals,)

535
00:18:44,409 --> 00:18:47,024
(that area will be closed off.)

536
00:18:47,050 --> 00:18:50,355
(If both feet go inside, they're eliminated.)

537
00:18:51,080 --> 00:18:55,064
(Did Han Na eliminate Seok Jin?)

538
00:18:56,189 --> 00:18:58,688
(Team Rabbit, Team Fox, and Team Pig were candidates.)

539
00:18:58,689 --> 00:19:01,334
(As of now, Team Pig and Han Na from Team Fox are alive.)

540
00:19:02,590 --> 00:19:03,799
I'll pick pig.

541
00:19:03,800 --> 00:19:04,958
(Gook Ju wants to confirm Team Pig.)

542
00:19:04,959 --> 00:19:06,544
Hello.

543
00:19:07,530 --> 00:19:10,274
(The 1-minute movie begins.)

544
00:19:10,999 --> 00:19:13,814
(A pig appears.)

545
00:19:14,570 --> 00:19:17,539
(Only a small piglet is seen.)

546
00:19:17,540 --> 00:19:19,615
(The movie is over.)

547
00:19:19,709 --> 00:19:22,054
There's no O or X? It's done?

548
00:19:25,719 --> 00:19:28,264
(No way!)

549
00:19:28,850 --> 00:19:31,658
(There aren't any forbidden animals in Team Pig?)

550
00:19:31,659 --> 00:19:32,994
Gook Ju.

551
00:19:33,630 --> 00:19:35,228
- What is it? - My gosh.

552
00:19:35,229 --> 00:19:36,574
What is it?

553
00:19:37,459 --> 00:19:38,458
The pigs aren't it.

554
00:19:38,459 --> 00:19:40,274
(Shocked)

555
00:19:40,999 --> 00:19:42,468
- What? - The pigs aren't it.

556
00:19:42,469 --> 00:19:43,768
There was an X.

557
00:19:43,769 --> 00:19:45,639
(She clearly saw it.)

558
00:19:45,640 --> 00:19:46,738
Hold on.

559
00:19:46,739 --> 00:19:48,314
(What is going on?)

560
00:19:49,009 --> 00:19:51,014
(There are 2 forbidden animals.)

561
00:19:51,540 --> 00:19:53,908
(The first hint said...)

562
00:19:53,909 --> 00:19:56,594
(that the forbidden animals lived in groups.)

563
00:19:57,050 --> 00:19:59,748
(They made a list of animals who lived in groups.)

564
00:19:59,749 --> 00:20:02,695
(However, they didn't have proof.)

565
00:20:03,159 --> 00:20:06,905
(They agreed that pigs, foxes, and rabbits lived in groups.)

566
00:20:07,790 --> 00:20:10,629
(That's how these candidates were formed.)

567
00:20:10,630 --> 00:20:13,244
(Seok Jin, Haha, and So Min have been eliminated.)

568
00:20:14,030 --> 00:20:17,599
(If it's not Team Pig,)

569
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:20,244
(that means it's Han Na.)

570
00:20:20,969 --> 00:20:22,039
(But there are two forbidden animals.)

571
00:20:22,040 --> 00:20:23,115
Why?

572
00:20:25,040 --> 00:20:27,849
Doesn't this mean we should suspect those...

573
00:20:27,850 --> 00:20:30,125
who don't live in groups?

574
00:20:30,350 --> 00:20:33,079
But think about this.

575
00:20:33,080 --> 00:20:35,718
Because of that first hint,

576
00:20:35,719 --> 00:20:37,518
we've only been suspecting those three teams.

577
00:20:37,519 --> 00:20:39,658
- Right. Let's not do that. - But I think...

578
00:20:39,659 --> 00:20:42,064
we should suspect the other teams as well.

579
00:20:42,189 --> 00:20:44,498
- We should check their DVDs too. - Then I want you guys...

580
00:20:44,499 --> 00:20:45,529
to watch our movie.

581
00:20:45,530 --> 00:20:47,498
(Gook Ju from Team Tiger makes a suggestion.)

582
00:20:47,499 --> 00:20:49,244
- Kwang Soo is suspicious. - Team Tiger?

583
00:20:50,169 --> 00:20:52,369
(Kwang Soo was awfully quiet today.)

584
00:20:52,370 --> 00:20:53,468
That's not true.

585
00:20:53,469 --> 00:20:54,984
(They started suspecting him.)

586
00:20:55,469 --> 00:20:57,885
(Even Gook Ju was suspicious of him.)

587
00:20:58,439 --> 00:21:01,125
(Could Gook Ju be right?)

588
00:21:01,310 --> 00:21:03,718
- That's not a bad idea. - Just trust me.

589
00:21:03,719 --> 00:21:05,549
- That's not a bad idea. - I won't check.

590
00:21:05,550 --> 00:21:07,188
- I won't. - You should check then.

591
00:21:07,189 --> 00:21:08,188
- Tiger. - Tiger.

592
00:21:08,189 --> 00:21:10,635
- Who will check? - I will.

593
00:21:11,019 --> 00:21:13,734
- Enjoy. - I won't take long.

594
00:21:14,130 --> 00:21:16,389
(Will they be able to narrow down the forbidden animals?)

595
00:21:16,390 --> 00:21:17,928
20 minutes and 40 seconds in.

596
00:21:17,929 --> 00:21:19,329
(He picks his timestamp.)

597
00:21:19,330 --> 00:21:21,869
- I'll play it now. - It's playing.

598
00:21:21,870 --> 00:21:23,415
(The movie begins.)

599
00:21:25,040 --> 00:21:28,215
(It's a movie scene with hunters and a tiger.)

600
00:21:28,840 --> 00:21:32,215
(Focused)

601
00:21:33,709 --> 00:21:37,279
(A small animal is spotted in front of the tiger.)

602
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:38,855
The tiger cub is dead.

603
00:21:40,790 --> 00:21:41,819
(The movie ends.)

604
00:21:41,820 --> 00:21:42,918
That's it?

605
00:21:42,919 --> 00:21:44,365
Please check the box.

606
00:21:44,659 --> 00:21:45,658
Where is it?

607
00:21:45,659 --> 00:21:47,728
(Is it an O or an X?)

608
00:21:47,729 --> 00:21:49,789
O? O?

609
00:21:49,790 --> 00:21:52,405
(It's an O.)

610
00:21:53,229 --> 00:21:54,468
(The tiger movie showed an O.)

611
00:21:54,469 --> 00:21:55,905
O?

612
00:21:56,699 --> 00:22:00,168
(Does this mean either Kwang Soo or Gook Ju is a forbidden animal?)

613
00:22:00,169 --> 00:22:01,738
(Shocked)

614
00:22:01,739 --> 00:22:02,945
- Jae Seok. - Did you check?

615
00:22:02,969 --> 00:22:04,879
- This makes no sense. - Why not?

616
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:06,609
- It's an O. - Really?

617
00:22:06,610 --> 00:22:08,208
I told you! It's Kwang Soo!

618
00:22:08,209 --> 00:22:09,625
Really?

619
00:22:10,179 --> 00:22:11,718
- It's an O? - Yes.

620
00:22:11,719 --> 00:22:12,855
(Their doubts have been confirmed.)

621
00:22:13,080 --> 00:22:14,764
It's Kwang Soo.

622
00:22:15,019 --> 00:22:16,465
It's him.

623
00:22:17,019 --> 00:22:18,294
This is driving me crazy.

624
00:22:19,060 --> 00:22:20,458
Should we just eliminate him?

625
00:22:20,459 --> 00:22:21,635
Should we?

626
00:22:21,860 --> 00:22:23,234
It's an O?

627
00:22:23,330 --> 00:22:25,859
(Kwang Soo...)

628
00:22:25,860 --> 00:22:27,744
(and Han Na are the strong candidates.)

629
00:22:28,800 --> 00:22:30,314
It's definitely him.

630
00:22:31,199 --> 00:22:32,369
(She's determined to eliminate him.)

631
00:22:32,370 --> 00:22:34,115
Let's eliminate Kwang Soo.

632
00:22:34,739 --> 00:22:35,809
It's not you, right?

633
00:22:35,810 --> 00:22:38,408
- No, it's definitely not me. Wait. - Right?

634
00:22:38,409 --> 00:22:41,425
(He spots Kwang Soo from afar.)

635
00:22:41,780 --> 00:22:43,324
(Flinching)

636
00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:47,119
(Maybe he will believe me.)

637
00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:48,119
I'll eliminate him.

638
00:22:48,120 --> 00:22:49,448
- What? - Grab him for me, I'll do it.

639
00:22:49,449 --> 00:22:50,718
- You trust me, right? - Really?

640
00:22:50,719 --> 00:22:53,329
You do, right? You grab him, and I'll rip it off.

641
00:22:53,330 --> 00:22:55,435
- You'll rip it? - Yes.

642
00:22:55,830 --> 00:22:57,029
(He decides to trust her.)

643
00:22:57,030 --> 00:22:58,504
- Se Chan. - Yes?

644
00:22:58,600 --> 00:23:00,744
- If you're right, - Go on.

645
00:23:00,870 --> 00:23:04,438
it's either Kwang Soo or Gook Ju.

646
00:23:04,439 --> 00:23:06,014
(He senses danger and leaves the scene.)

647
00:23:06,239 --> 00:23:07,869
- Look! He's running away! - He's running.

648
00:23:07,870 --> 00:23:09,039
See?

649
00:23:09,040 --> 00:23:10,938
(Catch him!)

650
00:23:10,939 --> 00:23:12,039
He's running.

651
00:23:12,040 --> 00:23:13,039
(Sprinting)

652
00:23:13,040 --> 00:23:14,324
Hey!

653
00:23:14,380 --> 00:23:15,379
Come here!

654
00:23:15,380 --> 00:23:18,079
(Stop right there!)

655
00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:20,149
Come here! He's running away!

656
00:23:20,150 --> 00:23:21,819
- Catch him! - It's not me!

657
00:23:21,820 --> 00:23:24,359
- Stop there! - It's not me!

658
00:23:24,360 --> 00:23:25,889
He's running away!

659
00:23:25,890 --> 00:23:26,958
My gosh!

660
00:23:26,959 --> 00:23:28,605
Hurry up!

661
00:23:29,429 --> 00:23:30,698
(Staggering)

662
00:23:30,699 --> 00:23:32,059
(She falls down.)

663
00:23:32,060 --> 00:23:33,768
(It's humiliating.)

664
00:23:33,769 --> 00:23:35,998
Gook Ju, come on.

665
00:23:35,999 --> 00:23:38,539
Gook Ju. Gook Ju.

666
00:23:38,540 --> 00:23:40,069
I'm done for.

667
00:23:40,070 --> 00:23:41,844
(Jong Kook, go on without me.)

668
00:23:41,939 --> 00:23:43,039
I'm done for.

669
00:23:43,040 --> 00:23:44,109
(It's too cold to lie down here.)

670
00:23:44,110 --> 00:23:46,539
- I'm done for. - Gook Ju.

671
00:23:46,540 --> 00:23:48,084
(She finds it funny too.)

672
00:23:48,110 --> 00:23:50,149
- Are you okay? - Hey.

673
00:23:50,150 --> 00:23:53,594
I must be really unfit.

674
00:23:53,650 --> 00:23:55,248
- Hey. - I collapsed.

675
00:23:55,249 --> 00:23:56,918
You wiped the floor...

676
00:23:56,919 --> 00:23:58,359
as you fell.

677
00:23:58,360 --> 00:23:59,418
(She realizes the importance of working out.)

678
00:23:59,419 --> 00:24:00,488
Gook Ju.

679
00:24:00,489 --> 00:24:02,034
I think it's Kwang Soo.

680
00:24:02,830 --> 00:24:05,175
(They're 100-percent sure since he ran away.)

681
00:24:06,159 --> 00:24:08,504
(Kwang Soo successfully runs away.)

682
00:24:09,630 --> 00:24:12,574
(Did he run away because he was a forbidden animal?)

683
00:24:13,169 --> 00:24:14,738
Let me explain.

684
00:24:14,739 --> 00:24:17,008
Among the candidates,

685
00:24:17,009 --> 00:24:18,579
I am the most suspicious of Han Na.

686
00:24:18,580 --> 00:24:20,649
Many people are suspicious of her.

687
00:24:20,650 --> 00:24:23,008
So we should watch her movie.

688
00:24:23,009 --> 00:24:24,478
- She's a fox. - She's a fox, right?

689
00:24:24,479 --> 00:24:26,094
"The Fox and the Child".

690
00:24:26,350 --> 00:24:28,018
- "The Fox and the Child". - "The Fox and the Child".

691
00:24:28,019 --> 00:24:29,748
(Sihyeon will be the one watching.)

692
00:24:29,749 --> 00:24:32,895
I'll watch from 11 minutes and 55 seconds.

693
00:24:33,689 --> 00:24:36,158
Once she comes out, I'll hear the result.

694
00:24:36,159 --> 00:24:37,498
And then...

695
00:24:37,499 --> 00:24:39,359
(If there's an O, Han Na is definitely a forbidden animal.)

696
00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:40,905
I'll share the info with the others.

697
00:24:41,469 --> 00:24:43,475
(She begins watching.)

698
00:24:44,100 --> 00:24:46,544
(Of course, a fox appears.)

699
00:24:47,570 --> 00:24:49,984
(Will other animals appear too?)

700
00:24:50,540 --> 00:24:51,579
(Only a fox appears...)

701
00:24:51,580 --> 00:24:53,309
(And her minute is up.)

702
00:24:53,310 --> 00:24:54,408
Okay.

703
00:24:54,409 --> 00:24:57,195
(Will it be an O or an X?)

704
00:24:57,679 --> 00:25:00,119
(If it is an O,)

705
00:25:00,120 --> 00:25:03,734
(then Han Na is a forbidden animal.)

706
00:25:04,919 --> 00:25:06,594
(What?)

707
00:25:07,429 --> 00:25:10,175
(It's an X!)

708
00:25:10,900 --> 00:25:13,605
(The fox isn't a forbidden animal?)

709
00:25:13,929 --> 00:25:15,875
(Flustered)

710
00:25:16,900 --> 00:25:18,539
(What is going on?)

711
00:25:18,540 --> 00:25:19,645
No...

712
00:25:19,999 --> 00:25:21,008
We're in trouble.

713
00:25:21,009 --> 00:25:22,615
- What? - No way.

714
00:25:22,939 --> 00:25:24,609
- It's all right. - We're in trouble.

715
00:25:24,610 --> 00:25:26,824
- What did you watch? - I got an X.

716
00:25:27,479 --> 00:25:28,579
Hold on a second.

717
00:25:28,580 --> 00:25:29,609
(The fox isn't the forbidden animal?)

718
00:25:29,610 --> 00:25:31,718
See what I mean? I said it wasn't the rabbit.

719
00:25:31,719 --> 00:25:35,524
(Why did Han Na lie about the rabbit video getting an O?)

720
00:25:36,449 --> 00:25:38,435
(Han Na watched a video of a rabbit earlier.)

721
00:25:39,689 --> 00:25:43,605
(What Han Na watched got an O.)

722
00:25:44,229 --> 00:25:47,375
(She thought that the rabbit was the forbidden animal.)

723
00:25:47,699 --> 00:25:49,574
(She told the truth.)

724
00:25:50,370 --> 00:25:53,784
(Han Na didn't lie. She told the truth!)

725
00:25:54,709 --> 00:25:56,208
- It's not me. - It's not her.

726
00:25:56,209 --> 00:26:01,478
(Then why wasn't one of the rabbits a forbidden animal?)

727
00:26:01,479 --> 00:26:04,948
(What on earth is going on?)

728
00:26:04,949 --> 00:26:06,279
I said it wasn't the rabbit.

729
00:26:06,280 --> 00:26:07,389
(They're all confused.)

730
00:26:07,390 --> 00:26:08,564
I'm going to leave.

731
00:26:08,689 --> 00:26:10,635
- Where? - Even you seem suspicious.

732
00:26:10,820 --> 00:26:13,188
- What's going on? - I'm so confused.

733
00:26:13,189 --> 00:26:14,534
Hear me out.

734
00:26:15,159 --> 00:26:17,705
(If the fox isn't the forbidden animal,)

735
00:26:18,060 --> 00:26:21,004
(then which of the nine is?)

736
00:26:21,870 --> 00:26:25,039
I should watch a DVD, so where's HyunA?

737
00:26:25,040 --> 00:26:27,468
Why does she keep avoiding me?

738
00:26:27,469 --> 00:26:29,539
Can't I watch this by myself?

739
00:26:29,540 --> 00:26:30,615
You can't.

740
00:26:31,580 --> 00:26:32,708
(The couple must be present even if only one can enter.)

741
00:26:32,709 --> 00:26:36,024
My partner has to be here? Where do I find her?

742
00:26:37,179 --> 00:26:39,524
Jae Seok is the forbidden animal!

743
00:26:41,219 --> 00:26:42,289
(HyunA's still filming another show on her own.)

744
00:26:42,290 --> 00:26:43,688
Please save me.

745
00:26:43,689 --> 00:26:45,064
(HyunA's still filming another show on her own.)

746
00:26:45,790 --> 00:26:48,188
(HyunA's solo drama)

747
00:26:48,189 --> 00:26:49,688
(On high alert)

748
00:26:49,689 --> 00:26:51,605
Don't breathe so loudly.

749
00:26:51,900 --> 00:26:54,375
(She's too absorbed in the game.)

750
00:26:54,929 --> 00:26:57,299
I should watch a DVD, so where's HyunA?

751
00:26:57,300 --> 00:26:59,875
(HyunA, where are you?)

752
00:27:00,269 --> 00:27:02,284
(At that moment!)

753
00:27:03,580 --> 00:27:04,579
Hold on.

754
00:27:04,580 --> 00:27:06,385
(Jae Seok gazes at the posters.)

755
00:27:07,009 --> 00:27:10,185
(He keeps looking at them for quite a while.)

756
00:27:10,719 --> 00:27:12,455
(Gazing)

757
00:27:13,219 --> 00:27:15,819
(Which poster caught Jae Seok's attention?)

758
00:27:15,820 --> 00:27:17,534
(DVD rental shop)

759
00:27:17,860 --> 00:27:19,635
(Is he looking at me?)

760
00:27:20,259 --> 00:27:21,258
(After gazing at the posters for a while...)

761
00:27:21,259 --> 00:27:22,758
Where do I find HyunA?

762
00:27:22,759 --> 00:27:23,905
(He leaves to look for HyunA.)

763
00:27:25,729 --> 00:27:27,599
- Ji Hyo. - Gosh, you startled me.

764
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:29,175
- What were you up to? - I...

765
00:27:30,469 --> 00:27:32,099
I was just looking at my phone.

766
00:27:32,100 --> 00:27:33,908
Why on earth is HyunA avoiding me?

767
00:27:33,909 --> 00:27:35,309
She's been running from everyone.

768
00:27:35,310 --> 00:27:36,915
(She's been running from everyone.)

769
00:27:37,540 --> 00:27:38,609
My gosh.

770
00:27:38,610 --> 00:27:40,355
(She lets out a weird scream.)

771
00:27:40,409 --> 00:27:42,385
(HyunA keeps running around screaming.)

772
00:27:43,409 --> 00:27:44,579
My gosh. Where is she?

773
00:27:44,580 --> 00:27:46,218
We talked about her,

774
00:27:46,219 --> 00:27:48,764
and it seems like she's filming another show.

775
00:27:49,249 --> 00:27:51,389
We need to watch this, so where is she?

776
00:27:51,390 --> 00:27:53,234
Can you find her for me?

777
00:27:53,489 --> 00:27:55,789
- I'll tell her if I see her. - Tell me if you see her.

778
00:27:55,790 --> 00:27:57,705
- Let me know as well. - Sure.

779
00:27:58,630 --> 00:28:00,574
(Where did she go?)

780
00:28:01,499 --> 00:28:02,574
HyunA!

781
00:28:03,469 --> 00:28:06,044
HyunA, you can't go there.

782
00:28:07,009 --> 00:28:09,185
(He spots HyunA who's been wandering around.)

783
00:28:09,909 --> 00:28:11,938
(She hides from him before asking why.)

784
00:28:11,939 --> 00:28:13,708
You can talk to me from there.

785
00:28:13,709 --> 00:28:14,708
HyunA.

786
00:28:14,709 --> 00:28:16,508
Talk to me from up there.

787
00:28:16,509 --> 00:28:19,279
This is important. We must watch this DVD...

788
00:28:19,280 --> 00:28:20,994
if we want to catch the forbidden animal.

789
00:28:21,419 --> 00:28:22,718
We both need to be present for this.

790
00:28:22,719 --> 00:28:24,695
Why is it that...

791
00:28:24,790 --> 00:28:26,658
- He's smiling. - your teeth show...

792
00:28:26,659 --> 00:28:28,758
when you smile?

793
00:28:28,759 --> 00:28:30,899
(Why are your teeth showing?)

794
00:28:30,900 --> 00:28:32,375
What?

795
00:28:32,759 --> 00:28:33,768
(HyunA finds his protruding teeth suspicious.)

796
00:28:33,769 --> 00:28:35,529
Why do my teeth show when I smile?

797
00:28:35,530 --> 00:28:38,698
My mouth has always been sticking out.

798
00:28:38,699 --> 00:28:39,938
You've got it all wrong.

799
00:28:39,939 --> 00:28:43,008
Anyway, HyunA, just join me this once.

800
00:28:43,009 --> 00:28:44,814
It's how we can solve this problem.

801
00:28:44,909 --> 00:28:46,284
We need to watch a DVD.

802
00:28:46,409 --> 00:28:47,609
- Okay. - Come on.

803
00:28:47,610 --> 00:28:49,008
Are you sure...

804
00:28:49,009 --> 00:28:51,619
Of course. Would I be asking you if I was a forbidden animal?

805
00:28:51,620 --> 00:28:53,794
Just join me for a second.

806
00:28:54,120 --> 00:28:56,718
Hurry. Join me downstairs.

807
00:28:56,719 --> 00:28:57,834
HyunA.

808
00:28:58,290 --> 00:28:59,688
Good, you're here.

809
00:28:59,689 --> 00:29:01,289
- HyunA, don't go anywhere. - Why?

810
00:29:01,290 --> 00:29:02,658
We need to watch the DVD.

811
00:29:02,659 --> 00:29:03,829
You watch it.

812
00:29:03,830 --> 00:29:05,258
All right, just come over here.

813
00:29:05,259 --> 00:29:06,658
- You can watch it. - Okay.

814
00:29:06,659 --> 00:29:08,198
- We're both here. - Right.

815
00:29:08,199 --> 00:29:10,569
I'll watch a DVD then.

816
00:29:10,570 --> 00:29:11,839
(He carefully chooses the DVD he'll watch.)

817
00:29:11,840 --> 00:29:13,215
What are you going to watch?

818
00:29:13,540 --> 00:29:15,309
Which one should I watch?

819
00:29:15,310 --> 00:29:18,885
(Choosing the right DVD is key.)

820
00:29:19,380 --> 00:29:23,084
(He can only enter once, so he's contemplating.)

821
00:29:23,919 --> 00:29:25,994
(Let me tell you about the DVD once again.)

822
00:29:26,749 --> 00:29:28,619
(The video will play for a minute.)

823
00:29:28,620 --> 00:29:29,718
(If the animal shows up, an O will light up.)

824
00:29:29,719 --> 00:29:31,789
(If not, you'll see an X.)

825
00:29:31,790 --> 00:29:35,758
(Which animals show up is key.)

826
00:29:35,759 --> 00:29:39,198
(An O could light up because of another animal that shows up.)

827
00:29:39,199 --> 00:29:40,468
I'll check the tiger.

828
00:29:40,469 --> 00:29:41,899
(But that already got an O.)

829
00:29:41,900 --> 00:29:43,938
- I watched that. - I need to be sure.

830
00:29:43,939 --> 00:29:47,639
Just because you saw a tiger, doesn't mean that it's...

831
00:29:47,640 --> 00:29:49,268
the forbidden animal.

832
00:29:49,269 --> 00:29:50,268
Then what...

833
00:29:50,269 --> 00:29:52,254
Since the DVD showed an O,

834
00:29:52,409 --> 00:29:53,908
I'm going to check again.

835
00:29:53,909 --> 00:29:55,849
If another animal...

836
00:29:55,850 --> 00:29:58,855
appeared on the DVD, then it might not be the tiger.

837
00:29:59,019 --> 00:30:01,789
Stay here. I'll check the DVD.

838
00:30:01,790 --> 00:30:04,018
(He decides to check the tiger DVD again.)

839
00:30:04,019 --> 00:30:05,094
All right.

840
00:30:05,820 --> 00:30:07,629
Here's "A Tiger's Tail".

841
00:30:07,630 --> 00:30:08,629
(If another animal doesn't show up,)

842
00:30:08,630 --> 00:30:11,834
(then the tiger is a forbidden animal.)

843
00:30:12,199 --> 00:30:14,645
(The 1-minute-video plays.)

844
00:30:14,999 --> 00:30:16,029
There's a tiger.

845
00:30:16,030 --> 00:30:17,774
(Highly focused)

846
00:30:19,040 --> 00:30:20,039
A dog?

847
00:30:20,040 --> 00:30:21,885
(A tiger appears and so does a dog.)

848
00:30:22,709 --> 00:30:23,738
(Only a tiger and a dog can be seen.)

849
00:30:23,739 --> 00:30:25,084
A dog isn't part of the race.

850
00:30:26,380 --> 00:30:27,455
O or X, which is it?

851
00:30:28,110 --> 00:30:30,008
(The video has stopped playing.)

852
00:30:30,009 --> 00:30:31,494
(Now it's time for the verdict.)

853
00:30:32,120 --> 00:30:34,948
(Only a tiger and a dog appeared during the minute.)

854
00:30:34,949 --> 00:30:37,234
(What's the verdict?)

855
00:30:41,060 --> 00:30:42,165
X?

856
00:30:43,090 --> 00:30:46,705
(It's now an X!)

857
00:30:48,030 --> 00:30:51,468
(In the tiger video that Se Chan watched,)

858
00:30:51,469 --> 00:30:55,544
(the forbidden animal had appeared.)

859
00:30:56,209 --> 00:30:58,109
(The screen now shows an X.)

860
00:30:58,110 --> 00:30:59,938
(What's going on?)

861
00:30:59,939 --> 00:31:00,948
Guys!

862
00:31:00,949 --> 00:31:02,309
(On guard)

863
00:31:02,310 --> 00:31:03,678
I just got goosebumps.

864
00:31:03,679 --> 00:31:04,918
Goosebumps? Why?

865
00:31:04,919 --> 00:31:06,418
All I saw were a tiger and a dog.

866
00:31:06,419 --> 00:31:08,218
The screen showed an X.

867
00:31:08,219 --> 00:31:11,865
(The tiger has been cleared from suspicion.)

868
00:31:12,259 --> 00:31:13,865
Then it's not the tiger?

869
00:31:14,689 --> 00:31:17,534
The earlier tiger video showed an O.

870
00:31:18,030 --> 00:31:19,799
Hold on. I got the chills.

871
00:31:19,800 --> 00:31:21,569
Is it the tiger then?

872
00:31:21,570 --> 00:31:23,899
No, it means that it's not the tiger.

873
00:31:23,900 --> 00:31:27,014
Then why did an O appear with the other video?

874
00:31:27,310 --> 00:31:29,039
This is really important.

875
00:31:29,040 --> 00:31:30,309
(He calls Se Chan to confirm it.)

876
00:31:30,310 --> 00:31:31,309
Yes, Jae Seok.

877
00:31:31,310 --> 00:31:33,109
Didn't you watch "The Tiger" earlier?

878
00:31:33,110 --> 00:31:34,948
- Yes. - I just watched a video...

879
00:31:34,949 --> 00:31:37,594
that featured a tiger and a dog. It showed an X.

880
00:31:37,719 --> 00:31:38,779
An X?

881
00:31:38,780 --> 00:31:41,289
That means the tiger isn't a forbidden animal.

882
00:31:41,290 --> 00:31:44,758
What did you see when you watched "The Tiger"?

883
00:31:44,759 --> 00:31:46,918
A lot of hunters,

884
00:31:46,919 --> 00:31:49,029
a tiger,

885
00:31:49,030 --> 00:31:51,299
and a baby tiger on the ground.

886
00:31:51,300 --> 00:31:53,998
Hold on a second. Okay, hold on.

887
00:31:53,999 --> 00:31:55,268
What? Why? Hello?

888
00:31:55,269 --> 00:31:56,375
(What? Why?)

889
00:31:56,600 --> 00:31:59,099
He just asked me for an answer and then hung up on me.

890
00:31:59,100 --> 00:32:01,668
- He watched a tiger video, right? - Yes, but it showed an X.

891
00:32:01,669 --> 00:32:04,208
Meanwhile, the video you saw showed an O.

892
00:32:04,209 --> 00:32:06,185
What's going on then?

893
00:32:06,840 --> 00:32:10,309
I watched "Peter Rabbit" and there was a rabbit.

894
00:32:10,310 --> 00:32:11,319
What did you see?

895
00:32:11,320 --> 00:32:12,748
A rabbit. Look.

896
00:32:12,749 --> 00:32:15,319
I saw this rabbit in the blue vest.

897
00:32:15,320 --> 00:32:17,889
He's on the tomato field and one gets crushed by a trap.

898
00:32:17,890 --> 00:32:19,064
It's a rabbit.

899
00:32:19,390 --> 00:32:21,789
- This got an O? - Yes.

900
00:32:21,790 --> 00:32:23,089
And all you saw were rabbits?

901
00:32:23,090 --> 00:32:25,758
Rabbits, tomatoes, a trap,

902
00:32:25,759 --> 00:32:27,405
a tractor, and a man.

903
00:32:28,630 --> 00:32:31,998
(The videos Se Chan and Han Na saw both got an O.)

904
00:32:31,999 --> 00:32:37,784
(The videos Se Chan and Han Na saw both got an O.)

00:32:42,550 --> 00:32:43,779
(DVD rental shop)

907
00:32:43,780 --> 00:32:46,554
(Suspicious posters on the wall)

908
00:32:47,419 --> 00:32:48,789
(Jae Seok notices something.)

909
00:32:48,790 --> 00:32:49,988
- Han Na. - Yes?

910
00:32:49,989 --> 00:32:51,359
(Han Na!)

911
00:32:51,360 --> 00:32:53,518
It's a person.

912
00:32:53,519 --> 00:32:55,258
(Out of the blue?)

913
00:32:55,259 --> 00:32:56,334
A person?

914
00:32:56,759 --> 00:32:57,829
But we're supposed to be animals.

915
00:32:57,830 --> 00:32:59,198
A person.

916
00:32:59,199 --> 00:33:01,198
(Jae Seok points to the posters.)

917
00:33:01,199 --> 00:33:03,599
A person. Human. That's it.

918
00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:05,099
Humans are animals too.

919
00:33:05,100 --> 00:33:07,145
Check out the red letters.

920
00:33:07,239 --> 00:33:08,268
Right?

921
00:33:08,269 --> 00:33:09,984
(Person, Human)

922
00:33:10,209 --> 00:33:12,109
- What does it mean? - They all had people in it.

923
00:33:12,110 --> 00:33:15,225
It's not an animal, but a human.

924
00:33:16,009 --> 00:33:18,324
- So there's a human among us? - A human!

925
00:33:18,419 --> 00:33:20,554
It's not an animal, but a human.

926
00:33:20,949 --> 00:33:23,965
There are two humans among us.

927
00:33:24,459 --> 00:33:27,734
(Humans also live in packs too.)

928
00:33:28,590 --> 00:33:30,188
Humans were the ones who killed the animals.

929
00:33:30,189 --> 00:33:31,799
There are humans among us.

930
00:33:31,800 --> 00:33:34,945
We must find the humans, but in what way?

931
00:33:35,169 --> 00:33:36,744
- Guys. - Yes?

932
00:33:37,030 --> 00:33:39,399
- Jae Seok. - We have humans among us.

933
00:33:39,400 --> 00:33:40,768
- What? - Humans?

934
00:33:40,769 --> 00:33:41,768
(What is he talking about?)

935
00:33:41,769 --> 00:33:42,839
Humans.

936
00:33:42,840 --> 00:33:44,715
- What are you saying? - Humans?

937
00:33:45,110 --> 00:33:47,008
- Yes, Kwang Soo. - Humans?

938
00:33:47,009 --> 00:33:49,508
Wait, humans are animals too.

939
00:33:49,509 --> 00:33:52,024
- That's right. - So we're looking for a person.

940
00:33:52,419 --> 00:33:53,695
Who can it be then?

941
00:33:54,290 --> 00:33:55,665
That I can't tell.

942
00:33:56,890 --> 00:33:59,865
Let's look around...

943
00:34:00,290 --> 00:34:01,629
and search for more clues.

944
00:34:01,630 --> 00:34:02,658
I will.

945
00:34:02,659 --> 00:34:03,829
Wait.

946
00:34:03,830 --> 00:34:04,928
Kwang Soo, come over here.

947
00:34:04,929 --> 00:34:07,698
Guys, Se Chan, Gook Ju, hear me out.

948
00:34:07,699 --> 00:34:09,168
I came back on my own accord.

949
00:34:09,169 --> 00:34:11,668
- Kwang Soo. - I was suffering, you know.

950
00:34:11,669 --> 00:34:12,998
Hear me out.

951
00:34:12,999 --> 00:34:14,084
Kwang Soo.

952
00:34:14,810 --> 00:34:16,369
Humans are animals too.

953
00:34:16,370 --> 00:34:17,584
(He's trying to comprehend the information.)

954
00:34:17,709 --> 00:34:19,984
You look like you know what he's talking about.

955
00:34:20,040 --> 00:34:21,609
What are you saying?

956
00:34:21,610 --> 00:34:23,178
Humans are animals too.

957
00:34:23,179 --> 00:34:25,779
The forbidden animal could also be a person...

958
00:34:25,780 --> 00:34:28,264
because humans are animals too.

959
00:34:28,919 --> 00:34:30,389
- So in a broader meaning? - Finally.

960
00:34:30,390 --> 00:34:32,718
The DVDs they watched...

961
00:34:32,719 --> 00:34:33,918
- all had people in them. - Right.

962
00:34:33,919 --> 00:34:36,865
That's why it showed an O which means you're not it.

963
00:34:37,030 --> 00:34:38,175
I'm sorry.

964
00:34:39,759 --> 00:34:42,105
(Kwang Soo lets out his anger.)

965
00:34:44,300 --> 00:34:46,738
- All day long... - I'm sorry.

966
00:34:46,739 --> 00:34:48,344
I've been chased all day.

967
00:34:49,110 --> 00:34:51,014
Every time I looked for a hint, I was chased.

968
00:34:52,280 --> 00:34:54,385
(I told you I was innocent.)

969
00:34:54,580 --> 00:34:57,425
The DVD rental shop and the library are closed now.

970
00:34:58,679 --> 00:35:00,225
- Jae Seok... - Where's Kwang Soo?

971
00:35:00,720 --> 00:35:01,918
Kwang Soo is innocent.

972
00:35:01,919 --> 00:35:04,489
- Kwang Soo is innocent. - The tiger is innocent.

973
00:35:04,490 --> 00:35:06,395
Ji Hyo, are you sure you're innocent?

974
00:35:07,260 --> 00:35:08,364
I'm innocent.

975
00:35:08,889 --> 00:35:10,105
I swear.

976
00:35:10,329 --> 00:35:12,699
- I don't even have any hints. - Are you...

977
00:35:12,700 --> 00:35:13,904
the forbidden one?

978
00:35:14,970 --> 00:35:17,899
(Since there aren't enough hints, everyone suspects everyone.)

979
00:35:17,900 --> 00:35:19,645
Are you a forbidden one?

980
00:35:20,169 --> 00:35:21,985
- Are you sure you aren't? - I'm not.

981
00:35:22,840 --> 00:35:24,438
Gosh.

982
00:35:24,439 --> 00:35:26,214
(Jae Seok is looking for hints about humans.)

983
00:35:26,479 --> 00:35:28,909
She's still here?

984
00:35:28,910 --> 00:35:32,424
(Onda is still in the closed library.)

985
00:35:33,220 --> 00:35:34,319
Why...

986
00:35:34,320 --> 00:35:35,565
(She's sitting still.)

987
00:35:36,550 --> 00:35:39,359
(Why is she still here?)

988
00:35:39,360 --> 00:35:41,529
Gosh, this is driving me crazy.

989
00:35:41,530 --> 00:35:42,688
(Yiren is still at the DVD rental shop.)

990
00:35:42,689 --> 00:35:43,904
Yiren is here too.

991
00:35:44,930 --> 00:35:47,375
(I'm still here.)

992
00:35:47,930 --> 00:35:51,114
(The announcement said the shop was closed.)

993
00:35:51,139 --> 00:35:52,275
Is anyone watching a DVD right now?

994
00:35:52,700 --> 00:35:53,944
No one is.

995
00:35:54,240 --> 00:35:56,315
Why are you still here?

996
00:35:56,669 --> 00:35:57,808
I just saw...

997
00:35:57,809 --> 00:35:59,384
Onda at the library.

998
00:36:00,079 --> 00:36:01,725
- And you're still here too. - Yes.

999
00:36:01,849 --> 00:36:04,549
(Does she have something left to do?)

1000
00:36:04,550 --> 00:36:06,578
You have a name tag on your back.

1001
00:36:06,579 --> 00:36:08,589
(She has a name tag on her back.)

1002
00:36:08,590 --> 00:36:09,824
I know nothing.

1003
00:36:10,789 --> 00:36:12,219
- I have no idea. - Yiren...

1004
00:36:12,220 --> 00:36:14,565
(Why would she need a name tag?)

1005
00:36:16,160 --> 00:36:17,404
Hi.

1006
00:36:17,599 --> 00:36:19,835
Hey! What are you doing here?

1007
00:36:20,530 --> 00:36:22,469
Are you a member of EVERGLOW?

1008
00:36:22,470 --> 00:36:23,605
- Yes. - That's right.

1009
00:36:24,030 --> 00:36:26,444
You have a name tag.

1010
00:36:26,840 --> 00:36:28,014
Why do you have one?

1011
00:36:28,240 --> 00:36:29,485
Go upstairs.

1012
00:36:30,539 --> 00:36:32,315
- Why does she have a name tag? - What?

1013
00:36:32,380 --> 00:36:33,514
Also,

1014
00:36:33,610 --> 00:36:35,355
why would she not tell me who she is?

1015
00:36:35,749 --> 00:36:36,848
Really?

1016
00:36:36,849 --> 00:36:39,018
(Strangely, she's still standing...)

1017
00:36:39,019 --> 00:36:41,895
(at the closed shop.)

1018
00:36:42,849 --> 00:36:44,194
Excuse me.

1019
00:36:44,860 --> 00:36:47,219
(Jae Seok checks the name tag on her back.)

1020
00:36:47,220 --> 00:36:49,005
- May I rip it off? - Yes.

1021
00:36:49,889 --> 00:36:51,228
Go ahead.

1022
00:36:51,229 --> 00:36:55,029
(Na 2-1?)

1023
00:36:55,030 --> 00:36:56,098
Go ahead.

1024
00:36:56,099 --> 00:36:58,299
(He finds mysterious letters on her back.)

1025
00:36:58,300 --> 00:36:59,475
Na 2-1?

1026
00:37:00,970 --> 00:37:02,315
What does this mean?

1027
00:37:02,769 --> 00:37:04,784
- Do you know what it means? - No.

1028
00:37:05,280 --> 00:37:06,478
I have no idea.

1029
00:37:06,479 --> 00:37:07,585
Wait.

1030
00:37:07,610 --> 00:37:08,955
Na 2-1?

1031
00:37:09,749 --> 00:37:10,895
Let me see.

1032
00:37:11,919 --> 00:37:13,654
The two must have the hints.

1033
00:37:14,650 --> 00:37:16,264
- You're still here. - Hi. Yes.

1034
00:37:16,919 --> 00:37:18,895
Just a second, Onda.

1035
00:37:18,959 --> 00:37:20,594
Hold on. What does it say?

1036
00:37:21,860 --> 00:37:23,065
Ga 8-1?

1037
00:37:24,090 --> 00:37:25,935
(Ga 8-1?)

1038
00:37:26,430 --> 00:37:29,505
(What do these letters on their backs mean?)

1039
00:37:29,930 --> 00:37:33,045
(Onda and Yiren were holding mysterious hints.)

1040
00:37:33,300 --> 00:37:36,985
(After seeing the letters, Jae Seok looks around.)

1041
00:37:38,209 --> 00:37:39,985
(He notices something on the bookshelves.)

1042
00:37:42,809 --> 00:37:43,909
Excuse me.

1043
00:37:43,910 --> 00:37:46,918
(The letters in the hints are written on the bookshelves.)

1044
00:37:46,919 --> 00:37:48,089
I'm sorry. Ga 8-1?

1045
00:37:48,090 --> 00:37:49,449
(He locates the letters from the hints.)

1046
00:37:49,450 --> 00:37:50,994
Ga 8-1.

1047
00:37:51,789 --> 00:37:53,659
(He finds a mysterious book...)

1048
00:37:53,660 --> 00:37:55,359
(at the location Ga 8-1.)

1049
00:37:55,360 --> 00:37:56,705
And then Na 2-1.

1050
00:37:57,829 --> 00:38:00,228
(He finds another book at the location Na 2-1.)

1051
00:38:00,229 --> 00:38:01,268
What's this?

1052
00:38:01,269 --> 00:38:03,444
(He finds another book at the location Na 2-1.)

1053
00:38:04,240 --> 00:38:06,469
(He found two books following the hints.)

1054
00:38:06,470 --> 00:38:07,585
I got goosebumps.

1055
00:38:08,769 --> 00:38:10,415
Let me see. Just a second.

1056
00:38:11,740 --> 00:38:15,125
(He opens the book.)

1057
00:38:17,209 --> 00:38:20,379
"The bear that became a woman was called Ungnyeo."

1058
00:38:20,380 --> 00:38:22,464
(The bear that became a woman was called Ungnyeo.)

1059
00:38:22,789 --> 00:38:23,964
Who's a bear?

1060
00:38:25,160 --> 00:38:28,364
(Se Chan and Ji Hyo are bears.)

1061
00:38:28,559 --> 00:38:30,659
"The bear that became a woman was called Ungnyeo."

1062
00:38:30,660 --> 00:38:34,029
(The bear that became a woman?)

1063
00:38:34,030 --> 00:38:36,199
It's Ji Hyo.

1064
00:38:36,200 --> 00:38:39,214
(Is the bear that became a woman Ji Hyo?)

1065
00:38:40,470 --> 00:38:43,614
(Jae Seok opens the other book hurriedly.)

1066
00:38:45,079 --> 00:38:46,614
"The sister turned into a fox"?

1067
00:38:48,110 --> 00:38:49,284
Who's a fox?

1068
00:38:51,019 --> 00:38:53,578
(The sister turned into a fox?)

1069
00:38:53,579 --> 00:38:54,864
Who's a fox?

1070
00:38:54,990 --> 00:38:57,248
(Seok Jin and Han Na are foxes.)

1071
00:38:57,249 --> 00:38:59,219
(Seok Jin is already eliminated.)

1072
00:38:59,220 --> 00:39:00,418
(That leaves Han Na.)

1073
00:39:00,419 --> 00:39:01,665
Han Na?

1074
00:39:04,160 --> 00:39:05,328
Is it Ji Hyo and Han Na?

1075
00:39:05,329 --> 00:39:09,645
(Are Ji Hyo and Han Na the forbidden animals, humans?)

1076
00:39:09,829 --> 00:39:15,268
(Is Jae Seok's guess right?)

1077
00:39:15,269 --> 00:39:18,038
Han Na, did you take any notes?

1078
00:39:18,039 --> 00:39:20,085
I did, but they're useless.

1079
00:39:20,110 --> 00:39:21,179
They're all useless.

1080
00:39:21,180 --> 00:39:22,625
(Just then)

1081
00:39:25,050 --> 00:39:28,824
(Ji Hyo pushes HyunA and Sihyeon into the closed area.)

1082
00:39:32,019 --> 00:39:34,065
HyunA and Sihyeon,

1083
00:39:34,360 --> 00:39:35,989
who are animals, are out.

1084
00:39:35,990 --> 00:39:37,188
- But my name tag is still there. - Mine too.

1085
00:39:37,189 --> 00:39:39,735
You stepped into the closed area, so you're out.

1086
00:39:41,499 --> 00:39:45,844
(When both feet of an animal get into the area, the animal is out.)

1087
00:39:46,639 --> 00:39:47,969
(I can't believe this.)

1088
00:39:47,970 --> 00:39:50,768
We promised we'd survive a long time.

1089
00:39:50,769 --> 00:39:53,284
(HyunA and Sihyeon got into the closed area and got eliminated.)

1090
00:39:54,139 --> 00:39:55,208
What do we do?

1091
00:39:55,209 --> 00:39:56,585
(I'm sorry, girls.)

1092
00:39:56,809 --> 00:39:59,824
(Han Na and Ji Hyo are the humans.)

1093
00:40:00,220 --> 00:40:02,788
Six pairs of animals will participate in today's race,

1094
00:40:02,789 --> 00:40:04,895
Mysterious Animal Farm.

1095
00:40:04,990 --> 00:40:08,835
You two are descendants of the forbidden animals,

1096
00:40:09,030 --> 00:40:10,705
who destroyed the farm decades ago.

1097
00:40:11,700 --> 00:40:12,904
The forbidden animals?

1098
00:40:13,499 --> 00:40:15,029
As you're forbidden animals,

1099
00:40:15,030 --> 00:40:16,498
you need to hide your identities.

1100
00:40:16,499 --> 00:40:18,244
Ji Hyo will pretend to be a brown bear.

1101
00:40:19,070 --> 00:40:21,569
- A brown bear is very strong. - A brown bear.

1102
00:40:21,570 --> 00:40:23,739
It can attack people.

1103
00:40:23,740 --> 00:40:25,685
I think it suits me.

1104
00:40:25,709 --> 00:40:28,679
- Han Na is an Arctic fox. - An Arctic fox?

1105
00:40:28,680 --> 00:40:31,025
I should have been an Arctic fox.

1106
00:40:31,050 --> 00:40:33,554
- You think so? - I should have been one.

1107
00:40:33,579 --> 00:40:36,795
To get your true identities back, you need to carry out...

1108
00:40:36,849 --> 00:40:38,719
hidden missions...

1109
00:40:38,720 --> 00:40:40,964
before the final race without getting caught.

1110
00:40:42,360 --> 00:40:43,835
Here's Ji Hyo's mission.

1111
00:40:43,889 --> 00:40:46,529
As bears are associated with paws,

1112
00:40:46,530 --> 00:40:48,469
she'll put a mini name tag...

1113
00:40:48,470 --> 00:40:51,168
on her partner's shoe.

1114
00:40:51,169 --> 00:40:52,475
(Ji Hyo put a name tag on Se Chan's shoe successfully.)

1115
00:40:53,700 --> 00:40:55,645
Han Na is an Arctic fox.

1116
00:40:55,939 --> 00:40:58,185
As foxes are associated with tails,

1117
00:40:58,240 --> 00:41:00,909
she'll kick her partner in the bottom once.

1118
00:41:00,910 --> 00:41:02,085
(Han Na accomplished her mission too.)

1119
00:41:03,309 --> 00:41:04,649
You forbidden animals...

1120
00:41:04,650 --> 00:41:06,518
successfully carried out your hidden mission.

1121
00:41:06,519 --> 00:41:09,025
Let me tell you your true identities.

1122
00:41:09,220 --> 00:41:13,364
The brown bear, Ji Hyo, and the Arctic fox, Han Na,

1123
00:41:13,559 --> 00:41:16,134
are, in fact, humans.

1124
00:41:16,660 --> 00:41:19,899
One of you will hand over a plastic item...

1125
00:41:19,900 --> 00:41:22,569
to a member to be eliminated.

1126
00:41:22,570 --> 00:41:25,598
When the other shoots the member's name tag...

1127
00:41:25,599 --> 00:41:28,185
with a water gun, that member is out.

1128
00:41:28,269 --> 00:41:30,308
It makes me sad.

1129
00:41:30,309 --> 00:41:32,208
Considering the environmental issues these days...

1130
00:41:32,209 --> 00:41:33,379
That's our intention.

1131
00:41:33,380 --> 00:41:34,755
That's the real theme.

1132
00:41:34,780 --> 00:41:36,685
I can't believe we'll be playing such evil roles.

1133
00:41:38,380 --> 00:41:41,324
(Han Na watched the DVD with her partner, Seok Jin.)

1134
00:41:42,119 --> 00:41:46,165
(Seok Jin drank from Han Na's plastic bottle unsuspectingly.)

1135
00:41:47,419 --> 00:41:48,458
(Han Na informs Ji Hyo of the situation.)

1136
00:41:48,459 --> 00:41:51,375
I got a text from Han Na.

1137
00:41:51,729 --> 00:41:54,899
(Shoot Seok Jin with a water gun.)

1138
00:41:54,900 --> 00:41:56,475
Have you found anything?

1139
00:41:56,769 --> 00:41:58,645
It's confusing. It's not going well.

1140
00:41:59,269 --> 00:42:00,574
Where's Han Na?

1141
00:42:02,169 --> 00:42:05,208
(When Seok Jin's back was turned to her,)

1142
00:42:05,209 --> 00:42:06,708
(Ji Hyo snuck up to him...)

1143
00:42:06,709 --> 00:42:08,654
(and shot him with a water gun.)

1144
00:42:09,579 --> 00:42:11,895
(Seok Jin was eliminated without anyone knowing.)

1145
00:42:13,919 --> 00:42:15,225
I'm sorry, Seok Jin.

1146
00:42:16,189 --> 00:42:17,288
I'm sorry.

1147
00:42:17,289 --> 00:42:19,994
(The humans, Han Na and Ji Hyo, have been eliminating animals.)

1148
00:42:21,459 --> 00:42:22,665
Ji Hyo and Han Na.

1149
00:42:22,860 --> 00:42:24,034
I have to find them.

1150
00:42:25,360 --> 00:42:27,705
(Jae Seok hurries down the stairs.)

1151
00:42:29,499 --> 00:42:30,705
Han Na.

1152
00:42:32,240 --> 00:42:33,668
- Han Na. - Yes?

1153
00:42:33,669 --> 00:42:35,344
- Where's everybody? - Why do you ask?

1154
00:42:35,410 --> 00:42:38,509
(Han Na backs off.)

1155
00:42:38,510 --> 00:42:41,554
(Jae Seok approaches Han Na.)

1156
00:42:41,849 --> 00:42:42,848
What's going on?

1157
00:42:42,849 --> 00:42:46,949
(The moment both his feet are inside the lines, he's out.)

1158
00:42:46,950 --> 00:42:48,449
Do you think I'm a forbidden animal?

1159
00:42:48,450 --> 00:42:50,864
(Glancing)

1160
00:42:50,950 --> 00:42:53,335
(Han Na has almost led Jae Seok into the closed area.)

1161
00:42:53,990 --> 00:42:55,105
What's this?

1162
00:42:55,329 --> 00:42:59,335
(Jae Seok notices it and steps back.)

1163
00:42:59,559 --> 00:43:00,799
Han Na.

1164
00:43:00,800 --> 00:43:01,944
(What a shame.)

1165
00:43:02,970 --> 00:43:05,714
(Just then)

1166
00:43:06,240 --> 00:43:07,299
Ji Hyo!

1167
00:43:07,300 --> 00:43:09,284
(Ji Hyo appears from the back.)

1168
00:43:09,410 --> 00:43:11,808
(She shoots Jae Seok's name tag and disappears.)

1169
00:43:11,809 --> 00:43:13,585
Ji Hyo! A water gun?

1170
00:43:14,010 --> 00:43:15,109
Did I get him?

1171
00:43:15,110 --> 00:43:16,478
(Jae Seok hasn't touched a plastic item yet.)

1172
00:43:16,479 --> 00:43:17,679
- Was he hit? - Hey!

1173
00:43:17,680 --> 00:43:18,848
Hey, Jong Kook!

1174
00:43:18,849 --> 00:43:19,994
(Dodging)

1175
00:43:20,720 --> 00:43:22,219
(A plastic water bottle is thrown at him.)

1176
00:43:22,220 --> 00:43:23,424
Jong Kook!

1177
00:43:23,519 --> 00:43:24,795
What?

1178
00:43:25,189 --> 00:43:26,918
It's Han Na and Ji Hyo!

1179
00:43:26,919 --> 00:43:28,205
Who?

1180
00:43:28,289 --> 00:43:30,659
- Han Na and Ji Hyo? - Who?

1181
00:43:30,660 --> 00:43:32,074
Han Na and Ji Hyo?

1182
00:43:32,459 --> 00:43:34,328
Do you have any plastic items?

1183
00:43:34,329 --> 00:43:36,498
Over there. I'll get it.

1184
00:43:36,499 --> 00:43:39,975
Hey, it's Han Na and Ji Hyo. Come here.

1185
00:43:40,240 --> 00:43:41,315
Are you sure?

1186
00:43:42,369 --> 00:43:43,938
(The failed operation puts the humans in danger.)

1187
00:43:43,939 --> 00:43:47,078
They just tried to shoot me with a water gun.

1188
00:43:47,079 --> 00:43:48,109
- Really? - Yes.

1189
00:43:48,110 --> 00:43:50,649
- They tried to shoot you? - There must be something.

1190
00:43:50,650 --> 00:43:51,795
But I don't know what it is.

1191
00:43:51,979 --> 00:43:53,518
- You got shot. - You did.

1192
00:43:53,519 --> 00:43:56,094
Yes, but there must be something else.

1193
00:43:57,050 --> 00:43:58,659
I think they both have to do something.

1194
00:43:58,660 --> 00:43:59,759
(A human approaches.)

1195
00:43:59,760 --> 00:44:01,735
Please check if I'm shot too.

1196
00:44:01,829 --> 00:44:03,228
- You're not shot. What about me? - You're fine.

1197
00:44:03,229 --> 00:44:04,429
They both have to do something.

1198
00:44:04,430 --> 00:44:05,998
(A plastic bottle is thrown...)

1199
00:44:05,999 --> 00:44:08,699
(and hits Jae Seok.)

1200
00:44:08,700 --> 00:44:09,799
What?

1201
00:44:09,800 --> 00:44:11,268
(Han Na threw a bottle at Jae Seok.)

1202
00:44:11,269 --> 00:44:13,114
I think she did that because she's angry.

1203
00:44:13,139 --> 00:44:14,784
- She's just angry. - She hates you.

1204
00:44:14,869 --> 00:44:16,685
She hates you.

1205
00:44:16,740 --> 00:44:18,578
(Jae Seok is out.)

1206
00:44:18,579 --> 00:44:20,415
- Jae Seok is out. - You're out.

1207
00:44:20,579 --> 00:44:22,384
Guys.

1208
00:44:22,510 --> 00:44:23,779
Let's rip her name tag off.

1209
00:44:23,780 --> 00:44:25,424
(I hit him.)

1210
00:44:25,550 --> 00:44:28,225
They both have to do something to eliminate someone.

1211
00:44:28,389 --> 00:44:30,364
- Do you get it? - One by one...

1212
00:44:30,990 --> 00:44:32,964
We're clear. Let's go.

1213
00:44:33,320 --> 00:44:36,458
- Han Na! - Han Na!

1214
00:44:36,459 --> 00:44:38,328
(Let's go get the forbidden animals, the humans!)

1215
00:44:38,329 --> 00:44:39,634
- Let's finish them. - Where's Kwang Soo?

1216
00:44:40,030 --> 00:44:41,444
- What's going on? - Let's finish them.

1217
00:44:41,999 --> 00:44:44,244
Kwang Soo. Hurry up. It's Han Na.

1218
00:44:44,269 --> 00:44:46,239
It's Han Na and Ji Hyo. Hurry up.

1219
00:44:46,240 --> 00:44:47,239
Han Na.

1220
00:44:47,240 --> 00:44:48,368
(Ji Hyo was watching the situation.)

1221
00:44:48,369 --> 00:44:50,409
- Where is Kwang Soo? - Han Na.

1222
00:44:50,410 --> 00:44:51,808
Kwang Soo.

1223
00:44:51,809 --> 00:44:54,955
It's Han Na and Ji Hyo. Hurry up.

1224
00:44:55,510 --> 00:44:56,848
Kwang Soo, let's hurry up.

1225
00:44:56,849 --> 00:44:59,194
(She aims for Kwang Soo's back.)

1226
00:45:00,180 --> 00:45:01,949
Kwang Soo!

1227
00:45:01,950 --> 00:45:03,225
(Kwang Soo, be careful!)

1228
00:45:03,349 --> 00:45:05,594
Kwang Soo.

1229
00:45:06,160 --> 00:45:08,589
(She succeeds hitting his name tag.)

1230
00:45:08,590 --> 00:45:09,688
Kwang Soo.

1231
00:45:09,689 --> 00:45:11,228
- Kwang Soo. Kwang Soo. - What?

1232
00:45:11,229 --> 00:45:13,859
You are out if Han Na hits you with a plastic bottle.

1233
00:45:13,860 --> 00:45:15,045
- A plastic bottle? - Beware of a plastic bottle.

1234
00:45:15,200 --> 00:45:17,168
You understood, right?

1235
00:45:17,169 --> 00:45:18,438
- Yes. - Beware of a plastic bottle.

1236
00:45:18,439 --> 00:45:20,069
Kwang Soo got hit by a water gun, so he is out.

1237
00:45:20,070 --> 00:45:21,969
Hold on. He didn't get hit by a water bottle.

1238
00:45:21,970 --> 00:45:23,239
- He got hit by a water gun. - We need to take them out.

1239
00:45:23,240 --> 00:45:24,569
When did you get hit by a water bottle?

1240
00:45:24,570 --> 00:45:25,839
Did I get hit by a water bottle?

1241
00:45:25,840 --> 00:45:28,154
(When did Kwang Soo come in contact with a plastic item?)

1242
00:45:28,849 --> 00:45:31,248
I want to share what I have. Would you take a look?

1243
00:45:31,249 --> 00:45:32,649
- What is it? - Take a look.

1244
00:45:32,650 --> 00:45:34,078
(Han Na handed over her notebook to Kwang Soo.)

1245
00:45:34,079 --> 00:45:35,219
(Kwang Soo's hand touched the spiral bind of the notebook.)

1246
00:45:35,220 --> 00:45:36,418
Take a look.

1247
00:45:36,419 --> 00:45:38,458
(The spiral of the notebook was plastic.)

1248
00:45:38,459 --> 00:45:39,864
(I got him!)

1249
00:45:40,289 --> 00:45:41,828
Kwang Soo, let's go.

1250
00:45:41,829 --> 00:45:42,859
Am I out?

1251
00:45:42,860 --> 00:45:45,674
Kwang Soo, who is an animal, is out.

1252
00:45:45,729 --> 00:45:48,699
- I told you they were suspicious. - Ji Hyo was suspicious.

1253
00:45:48,700 --> 00:45:51,799
I told you they were suspicious. I told you Ji Hyo is suspicious.

1254
00:45:51,800 --> 00:45:53,069
What should we do?

1255
00:45:53,070 --> 00:45:54,199
(The forbidden animals formulate a plan.)

1256
00:45:54,200 --> 00:45:55,839
Let's get Jong Kook first.

1257
00:45:55,840 --> 00:45:57,038
- Let's do that together. - Yes.

1258
00:45:57,039 --> 00:45:58,554
Let's get Jong Kook first.

1259
00:45:59,110 --> 00:46:01,038
We just need to shoot his name tag with a water gun. I will lure him.

1260
00:46:01,039 --> 00:46:02,078
(He already touched plastic.)

1261
00:46:02,079 --> 00:46:04,355
Let me see your guesses.

1262
00:46:05,050 --> 00:46:07,779
(Jong Kook touched the plastic spiral.)

1263
00:46:07,780 --> 00:46:10,418
(Jong Kook will be out once he gets hit with a water gun.)

1264
00:46:10,419 --> 00:46:12,888
(They will take out the others with plastic spoons.)

1265
00:46:12,889 --> 00:46:14,958
(Let's come from behind and win.)

1266
00:46:14,959 --> 00:46:16,264
Let's go.

1267
00:46:18,200 --> 00:46:22,105
(The forbidden animals approach the remaining survivors.)

1268
00:46:22,930 --> 00:46:24,029
They are here.

1269
00:46:24,030 --> 00:46:25,469
(Wary)

1270
00:46:25,470 --> 00:46:26,899
(It's the humans versus...)

1271
00:46:26,900 --> 00:46:28,168
(the animals.)

1272
00:46:28,169 --> 00:46:31,344
Be careful. I don't think that will take me out.

1273
00:46:31,479 --> 00:46:33,538
- It's the water gun. - It's the water gun.

1274
00:46:33,539 --> 00:46:34,608
(The plastic and water gun take out an animal.)

1275
00:46:34,609 --> 00:46:35,709
(At that moment)

1276
00:46:35,710 --> 00:46:36,854
Hurry up and come here.

1277
00:46:37,350 --> 00:46:39,648
(Jong Kook attacks Ji Hyo.)

1278
00:46:39,649 --> 00:46:42,964
(Ji Hyo's water gun aims at Jong Kook's name tag.)

1279
00:46:43,559 --> 00:46:47,343
(If Jong Kook is out, it will be 2 against 2.)

1280
00:46:48,042 --> 00:46:50,051
(The Strong One versus The Sniper)

1281
00:46:50,380 --> 00:46:53,125
(What will be the result of the final showdown?)

1282
00:46:53,869 --> 00:46:57,504
(If Jong Kook is out, it will be 2 against 2.)

1283
00:46:58,239 --> 00:47:01,015
(The Strong One versus The Sniper)

1284
00:47:01,139 --> 00:47:03,055
The race has ended.

1285
00:47:03,110 --> 00:47:04,678
The race has ended.

1286
00:47:04,679 --> 00:47:06,209
(The race ends with the result shrouded in mystery.)

1287
00:47:06,210 --> 00:47:08,618
In today's race,

1288
00:47:08,619 --> 00:47:11,189
the forbidden animals who destroyed the farm...

1289
00:47:11,190 --> 00:47:13,349
and took out other animals...

1290
00:47:13,350 --> 00:47:14,734
were humans.

1291
00:47:14,860 --> 00:47:16,118
My goodness.

1292
00:47:16,119 --> 00:47:17,758
- Humans are animals too. - That's right.

1293
00:47:17,759 --> 00:47:19,559
I was so startled.

1294
00:47:19,560 --> 00:47:22,975
Plastic represents environmental pollution.

1295
00:47:23,100 --> 00:47:24,899
Plastic and dirty water.

1296
00:47:24,900 --> 00:47:26,475
- Pollution and... - The destruction of the ecosystem.

1297
00:47:27,069 --> 00:47:28,669
Humans kill animals.

1298
00:47:28,670 --> 00:47:30,245
- That's what... - During the race,

1299
00:47:30,639 --> 00:47:32,769
the place where the animals died became closed off.

1300
00:47:32,770 --> 00:47:36,508
It shows how humans encroach on animals' habitats.

1301
00:47:36,509 --> 00:47:37,908
(Animals lose their habitats due to mindless development.)

1302
00:47:37,909 --> 00:47:38,979
It's sad.

1303
00:47:38,980 --> 00:47:41,854
So who won today? I am curious.

1304
00:47:41,949 --> 00:47:43,879
I don't know the result because I was in prison.

1305
00:47:43,880 --> 00:47:45,865
The winner of today's race is...

1306
00:47:47,420 --> 00:47:49,088
(Team Humans...)

1307
00:47:49,089 --> 00:47:51,588
(versus Team Animals with 3 members)

1308
00:47:51,589 --> 00:47:53,059
(Which team won?)

1309
00:47:53,060 --> 00:47:54,234
Team Animals.

1310
00:47:54,699 --> 00:47:55,729
- Did we win? - Did we win?

1311
00:47:55,730 --> 00:47:58,698
(Team Animals won.)

1312
00:47:58,699 --> 00:48:00,099
- We won. - Really?

1313
00:48:00,100 --> 00:48:01,615
(We won.)

1314
00:48:02,299 --> 00:48:03,568
(Earlier,)

1315
00:48:03,569 --> 00:48:05,468
(Jong Kook grabbed Ji Hyo.)

1316
00:48:05,469 --> 00:48:07,568
(Running over)

1317
00:48:07,569 --> 00:48:08,778
Rip off her name tag. Hurry up.

1318
00:48:08,779 --> 00:48:10,979
(Jong Kook and Gook Ju worked together.)

1319
00:48:10,980 --> 00:48:12,908
(Ripping)

1320
00:48:12,909 --> 00:48:15,249
(Ji Hyo, who is a human, is out.)

1321
00:48:15,250 --> 00:48:16,495
Ji Hyo is out.

1322
00:48:16,580 --> 00:48:18,194
- It didn't hit your name tag. - It didn't, right?

1323
00:48:18,719 --> 00:48:21,024
(Jong Kook's name tag was clean.)

1324
00:48:21,560 --> 00:48:23,294
- It's clean. - Rip off her name tag.

1325
00:48:23,759 --> 00:48:25,059
(She was knocked out by Gook Ju.)

1326
00:48:25,060 --> 00:48:26,734
Rip off her name tag.

1327
00:48:27,159 --> 00:48:28,428
My goodness.

1328
00:48:28,429 --> 00:48:29,499
(Ripping)

1329
00:48:29,500 --> 00:48:30,798
It's over, Han Na.

1330
00:48:30,799 --> 00:48:31,999
(Han Na, the last human, is out.)

1331
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:33,868
My goodness.

1332
00:48:33,869 --> 00:48:35,099
That's incredible.

1333
00:48:35,100 --> 00:48:39,309
Today, the two humans will suffer the water bomb penalty.

1334
00:48:39,310 --> 00:48:40,508
That's clean.

1335
00:48:40,509 --> 00:48:41,939
One.

1336
00:48:41,940 --> 00:48:42,979
- 2. - 2.

1337
00:48:42,980 --> 00:48:43,979
(Let's go.)

1338
00:48:43,980 --> 00:48:45,225
- 3. - 3.

1339
00:48:47,009 --> 00:48:49,825
(Pouring)

1340
00:48:50,250 --> 00:48:55,189
(The cold shower washes away the humans' sins.)

1341
00:48:55,190 --> 00:48:56,734
Look at Ji Hyo's hair.

1342
00:48:57,389 --> 00:48:59,535
Han Na is great.

1343
00:48:59,560 --> 00:49:00,829
(Dancing)

1344
00:49:00,830 --> 00:49:03,899
(The Animal Farm Race ends with a dance.)

1345
00:49:03,900 --> 00:49:05,099
Are you okay?

1346
00:49:05,100 --> 00:49:06,198
(One day 2 weeks later)

1347
00:49:06,199 --> 00:49:07,729
- Hello. - Hello.

1348
00:49:07,730 --> 00:49:09,245
- Hello. - Hello.

1349
00:49:10,469 --> 00:49:12,868
- It has been a while. - It really has been a while.

1350
00:49:12,869 --> 00:49:14,479
I feel like I am back in my hometown.

1351
00:49:14,480 --> 00:49:15,838
It has been a while.

1352
00:49:15,839 --> 00:49:18,579
On SNS, you really went on a trip.

1353
00:49:18,580 --> 00:49:19,778
- That's right. - Seriously.

1354
00:49:19,779 --> 00:49:21,225
You really went on a trip.

1355
00:49:21,420 --> 00:49:22,778
- But... - He went to Vietnam.

1356
00:49:22,779 --> 00:49:24,425
he went to Vietnam.

1357
00:49:25,089 --> 00:49:28,388
(Last week's episode)

1358
00:49:28,389 --> 00:49:31,888
(So Min said Seok Jin wants to go to the Czech Republic alone.)

1359
00:49:31,889 --> 00:49:33,888
(I plan to go alone.)

1360
00:49:33,889 --> 00:49:35,705
(He must be having an affair.)

1361
00:49:36,529 --> 00:49:39,644
(The rumors spread.)

1362
00:49:39,799 --> 00:49:41,068
He really went on a trip.

1363
00:49:41,069 --> 00:49:43,138
(He ended up going to Vietnam!)

1364
00:49:43,139 --> 00:49:45,508
- But he went... - Seok Jin.

1365
00:49:45,509 --> 00:49:46,568
- to Vietnam. - That's right.

1366
00:49:46,569 --> 00:49:48,678
Who took those photos?

1367
00:49:48,679 --> 00:49:50,338
- You couldn't have taken them. - He went with his wife.

1368
00:49:50,339 --> 00:49:52,309
- I went with my wife. - I see.

1369
00:49:52,310 --> 00:49:53,379
- I went with my wife... - I knew it.

1370
00:49:53,380 --> 00:49:55,048
- in the end. - I told you...

1371
00:49:55,049 --> 00:49:56,725
he won't be able to travel alone.

1372
00:49:56,920 --> 00:49:58,919
- I thought you had her permission. - Jae Seok has foresight.

1373
00:49:58,920 --> 00:50:00,495
- I made that prediction. - Yes.

1374
00:50:00,750 --> 00:50:03,359
She asked me if I really plan to go alone.

1375
00:50:03,360 --> 00:50:05,334
I said, "Of course not. You can join me if you want."

1376
00:50:05,389 --> 00:50:06,935
Then she said, "Okay."

1377
00:50:07,529 --> 00:50:09,459
(He had to give up on his plan to go to the Czech Republic.)

1378
00:50:09,460 --> 00:50:11,028
- You couldn't turn her down. - I only asked...

1379
00:50:11,029 --> 00:50:14,229
to be polite. I only asked to be polite.

1380
00:50:14,230 --> 00:50:16,599
She bought two tickets.

1381
00:50:16,600 --> 00:50:18,814
Had he insisted on going alone, she would have canceled the trip.

1382
00:50:19,009 --> 00:50:20,868
- Seriously. - I had so much fun.

1383
00:50:20,869 --> 00:50:22,854
- What was so much fun? - I saw historic sites.

1384
00:50:23,080 --> 00:50:24,979
- What did you see? - If you were so happy,

1385
00:50:24,980 --> 00:50:26,979
why didn't you post photos you took with your wife?

1386
00:50:26,980 --> 00:50:28,318
Seriously. Why did you take the photos alone?

1387
00:50:28,319 --> 00:50:30,048
I thought a lot about posting our photos.

1388
00:50:30,049 --> 00:50:32,149
On SNS, he seems like...

1389
00:50:32,150 --> 00:50:33,624
a single man.

1390
00:50:35,219 --> 00:50:36,519
Seriously.

1391
00:50:36,520 --> 00:50:38,059
- Well... - You know,

1392
00:50:38,060 --> 00:50:40,789
- some men are like that. - That's right.

1393
00:50:40,790 --> 00:50:43,475
There are married men who pretend to be single.

1394
00:50:43,699 --> 00:50:46,829
Seok Jin, Se Chan cares a lot about you.

1395
00:50:46,830 --> 00:50:49,075
- What do you mean? - If you are wearing sunglasses,

1396
00:50:49,139 --> 00:50:51,269
- he zooms in on the photo. - Why?

1397
00:50:51,270 --> 00:50:52,838
He does it to check if you are with another woman.

1398
00:50:52,839 --> 00:50:54,709
I do it just in case. It's a scary thought.

1399
00:50:54,710 --> 00:50:56,238
He does it to check if you are with another woman.

1400
00:50:56,239 --> 00:50:58,209
I do it just in case. It's a scary thought.

1401
00:50:58,210 --> 00:51:00,109
I didn't know you went on a trip with your wife.

1402
00:51:00,110 --> 00:51:01,718
So I was like, "Hold on."

1403
00:51:01,719 --> 00:51:02,919
- I had to check. - That's right.

1404
00:51:02,920 --> 00:51:05,048
I joked about how he must have...

1405
00:51:05,049 --> 00:51:06,789
- a mistress. - That's right.

1406
00:51:06,790 --> 00:51:08,258
That made many people suspicious.

1407
00:51:08,259 --> 00:51:10,464
Many articles about that comment got released.

1408
00:51:10,560 --> 00:51:12,305
I was so surprised.

1409
00:51:12,889 --> 00:51:15,004
(Thus, "Seok Jin in Crisis" persona came to be.)

1410
00:51:15,130 --> 00:51:16,629
- Kwang Soo. - Yes?

1411
00:51:16,630 --> 00:51:18,229
- It's too much. - What?

1412
00:51:18,230 --> 00:51:19,368
(It's too much.)

1413
00:51:19,369 --> 00:51:21,068
(Jae Seok suddenly attacks him.)

1414
00:51:21,069 --> 00:51:22,238
- His fashion is too much. - Today,

1415
00:51:22,239 --> 00:51:24,099
- he dressed up too much. - It's too much.

1416
00:51:24,100 --> 00:51:25,238
It's too much.

1417
00:51:25,239 --> 00:51:27,669
She dressed up too.

1418
00:51:27,670 --> 00:51:31,825
On SNS, I saw how Se Chan used an app...

1419
00:51:31,909 --> 00:51:33,849
and got me as a celebrity lookalike.

1420
00:51:33,850 --> 00:51:35,794
- He posted it on SNS. - Really?

1421
00:51:36,020 --> 00:51:38,048
There were over 2,000 comments.

1422
00:51:38,049 --> 00:51:40,265
- Really? - Everyone laughed.

1423
00:51:40,549 --> 00:51:43,095
It was particularly upsetting...

1424
00:51:43,259 --> 00:51:45,658
because I used the best photo of myself.

1425
00:51:45,659 --> 00:51:47,329
- Then I got you. - Yes.

1426
00:51:47,330 --> 00:51:49,334
- I used that app too. - Who did you get?

1427
00:51:49,360 --> 00:51:51,698
- I haven't used that app. - I buried it in fear of backlash.

1428
00:51:51,699 --> 00:51:52,729
- Who did you get? - Who did you get?

1429
00:51:52,730 --> 00:51:55,198
(Who did he get?)

1430
00:51:55,199 --> 00:51:56,198
Who did you get?

1431
00:51:56,199 --> 00:51:57,698
I got Leonardo DiCaprio.

1432
00:51:57,699 --> 00:51:58,885
For goodness' sake.

1433
00:51:59,210 --> 00:52:01,138
(That kind of nonsense will make the Titanic take a U-turn.)

1434
00:52:01,139 --> 00:52:02,908
- I am serious. - Get out of my face.

1435
00:52:02,909 --> 00:52:04,214
I could show you.

1436
00:52:04,440 --> 00:52:06,185
I am serious. I could show you.

1437
00:52:06,710 --> 00:52:08,349
- Stop talking nonsense. - I am serious.

1438
00:52:08,350 --> 00:52:10,548
(I will show mine too.)

1439
00:52:10,549 --> 00:52:12,249
Look at this. I got...

1440
00:52:12,250 --> 00:52:13,749
- Beenzino. - What?

1441
00:52:13,750 --> 00:52:14,758
(Your celebrity lookalike is Beenzino.)

1442
00:52:14,759 --> 00:52:17,464
(This is ridiculous.)

1443
00:52:17,960 --> 00:52:22,999
You got Park Joon Hyung too.

1444
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:24,129
(Here comes Park Joon Hyung.)

1445
00:52:24,130 --> 00:52:25,798
Hold on. You got Park Joon Hyung too.

1446
00:52:25,799 --> 00:52:26,868
Let me see.

1447
00:52:26,869 --> 00:52:29,769
- What is wrong with him? - You got Park Joon Hyung too.

1448
00:52:29,770 --> 00:52:31,508
What is wrong with him?

1449
00:52:31,509 --> 00:52:33,138
He got Park Joon Hyung too.

1450
00:52:33,139 --> 00:52:34,209
For goodness' sake.

1451
00:52:34,210 --> 00:52:36,278
Before I dive into the explanation,

1452
00:52:36,279 --> 00:52:39,484
let me tell you that there are guests...

1453
00:52:39,949 --> 00:52:41,084
on standby.

1454
00:52:41,250 --> 00:52:43,079
Let's bring them in.

1455
00:52:43,080 --> 00:52:44,254
Who are they?

1456
00:52:44,279 --> 00:52:45,618
(Who are the guests?)

1457
00:52:45,619 --> 00:52:47,095
- Who are they? - Who are they?

1458
00:52:48,360 --> 00:52:50,059
- Who are they? - Who are they?

1459
00:52:50,060 --> 00:52:51,359
Gosh, it has been a while.

1460
00:52:51,360 --> 00:52:52,789
- Eun Su. - My goodness.

1461
00:52:52,790 --> 00:52:55,675
(The competitive one, Seo Eun Su and the rising star, Choi Ri)

1462
00:52:56,360 --> 00:52:59,399
(She can pull off a dialect.)

1463
00:52:59,400 --> 00:53:03,599
(Seo Eun Su is a unique actress with many charms.)

1464
00:53:03,600 --> 00:53:07,609
(On Running Man, she was the queen of competition.)

1465
00:53:07,610 --> 00:53:09,185
- My goodness. - No, no.

1466
00:53:10,239 --> 00:53:13,048
(Choi Ri is a newly debuted actress...)

1467
00:53:13,049 --> 00:53:15,925
(with incredible acting skills and cheerful charms.)

1468
00:53:17,920 --> 00:53:19,095
Eun Su.

1469
00:53:19,319 --> 00:53:20,318
It has been a while.

1470
00:53:20,319 --> 00:53:21,859
- Hello. - It has been a while. Hello.

1471
00:53:21,860 --> 00:53:23,118
- Hello. - It's her.

1472
00:53:23,119 --> 00:53:25,028
(Did we get female guests only?)

1473
00:53:25,029 --> 00:53:27,588
Actually, there are two more guests.

1474
00:53:27,589 --> 00:53:29,559
So Min and Ji Hyo always get disappointed...

1475
00:53:29,560 --> 00:53:31,298
when they are female guests only.

1476
00:53:31,299 --> 00:53:33,845
- So Min. - There are male guests.

1477
00:53:34,100 --> 00:53:35,769
- Why is it necessary? - So Min is happy.

1478
00:53:35,770 --> 00:53:37,774
We have these two already. Why do we need more?

1479
00:53:37,869 --> 00:53:39,769
- Ji Hyo. - Let's invite...

1480
00:53:39,770 --> 00:53:42,039
- the remaining two guests. - All right.

1481
00:53:42,040 --> 00:53:45,479
It's been a long time since we had new faces. I'm glad.

1482
00:53:45,480 --> 00:53:47,048
It's been a long time since we had male guests.

1483
00:53:47,049 --> 00:53:49,579
- It's Kyeong Hwan. - Look at that guy.

1484
00:53:49,580 --> 00:53:51,464
Jinyoung is here too.

1485
00:53:52,219 --> 00:53:54,988
(Heo Kyeong Hwan is a handsome comedian with a nice body.)

1486
00:53:54,989 --> 00:54:00,805
(He recently formed Maheun Five which is a band.)

1487
00:54:01,429 --> 00:54:09,015
(Jinyoung of GOT7 captured every woman's heart.)

1488
00:54:09,400 --> 00:54:11,198
(I don't know where to look.)

1489
00:54:11,199 --> 00:54:14,468
(So Min was all fidgety because of him.)

1490
00:54:14,469 --> 00:54:15,908
(She's blushing.)

1491
00:54:15,909 --> 00:54:21,595
(She's had a crush on him since then.)

1492
00:54:22,049 --> 00:54:25,225
- I was like doing this. - Doing this.

1493
00:54:25,719 --> 00:54:26,948
- Jinyoung. - Hello.

1494
00:54:26,949 --> 00:54:29,118
- Please welcome me too. - Hello.

1495
00:54:29,119 --> 00:54:30,388
Kyeong Hwan is here.

1496
00:54:30,389 --> 00:54:32,388
(What am I going to do?)

1497
00:54:32,389 --> 00:54:34,028
It's so good to see you too.

1498
00:54:34,029 --> 00:54:35,258
It's Jinyoung.

1499
00:54:35,259 --> 00:54:37,135
Kyeong Hwan is here.

1500
00:54:37,199 --> 00:54:39,629
Gosh, it's Jinyoung.

1501
00:54:39,630 --> 00:54:42,269
- Why? Do you like him? - Yes, when he came last time.

1502
00:54:42,270 --> 00:54:43,769
Hello, owner of a wood-fired pizza place.

1503
00:54:43,770 --> 00:54:45,644
- Hello. - What's wrong, So Min?

1504
00:54:46,009 --> 00:54:48,678
- So Min. - She's shy because of Jinyoung.

1505
00:54:48,679 --> 00:54:51,109
- Don't worry about her. - She really likes him.

1506
00:54:51,110 --> 00:54:52,579
Go to the middle.

1507
00:54:52,580 --> 00:54:54,408
- We have to switch spots. - She keeps on whispering,

1508
00:54:54,409 --> 00:54:56,048
"He's handsome."

1509
00:54:56,049 --> 00:54:58,388
- Stand next to him. - This is our second time meeting.

1510
00:54:58,389 --> 00:55:02,818
When we first met, we took a picture.

1511
00:55:02,819 --> 00:55:06,189
Are you on a date with Ji Hyo right now?

1512
00:55:06,190 --> 00:55:07,928
- No. - Why are you so close to her?

1513
00:55:07,929 --> 00:55:09,658
You never link arms with Ji Hyo.

1514
00:55:09,659 --> 00:55:10,999
Why are you linking your arms with hers?

1515
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:13,499
- She's shy, so she hid behind me. - Why is she doing that?

1516
00:55:13,500 --> 00:55:16,138
You want to link arms with him, but you settled with her.

1517
00:55:16,139 --> 00:55:17,638
- Kyeong Hwan. - Kyeong Hwan.

1518
00:55:17,639 --> 00:55:19,209
You sound so impatient.

1519
00:55:19,210 --> 00:55:20,908
Are you a middle-aged man walking through the neighborhood?

1520
00:55:20,909 --> 00:55:22,579
Are your hands inside your pockets or not?

1521
00:55:22,580 --> 00:55:24,309
Were you supposed to go on the radio and came here instead?

1522
00:55:24,310 --> 00:55:26,309
I'm considering whether to put my hands inside my pockets or not.

1523
00:55:26,310 --> 00:55:28,655
You are dressed for the radio.

1524
00:55:28,920 --> 00:55:31,749
Let me give some brief introductions.

1525
00:55:31,750 --> 00:55:33,488
- I'm happy to see them. - Eun Su.

1526
00:55:33,489 --> 00:55:36,095
Nice to meet you.

1527
00:55:36,489 --> 00:55:39,258
When she came last time, she showed us the insider dance.

1528
00:55:39,259 --> 00:55:40,789
That's right.

1529
00:55:40,790 --> 00:55:42,129
- I remember. - It was the alien dance.

1530
00:55:42,130 --> 00:55:44,359
- This dance. - I did the alien dance.

1531
00:55:44,360 --> 00:55:47,245
I was waiting for it, but it got edited out.

1532
00:55:47,699 --> 00:55:49,198
I was pretty upset.

1533
00:55:49,199 --> 00:55:51,138
It got edited out?

1534
00:55:51,139 --> 00:55:52,868
- Why did you edit it out? - That's the producer who did it.

1535
00:55:52,869 --> 00:55:54,738
(My bad.)

1536
00:55:54,739 --> 00:55:56,008
- That time, - Gook Ju's chair dance.

1537
00:55:56,009 --> 00:55:58,709
- Gook Ju was too intense. - The chair sank.

1538
00:55:58,710 --> 00:55:59,785
Right.

1539
00:56:00,210 --> 00:56:01,519
(Gook Ju did the chair dance.)

1540
00:56:01,520 --> 00:56:03,419
(She's back on the show after 5 minutes.)

1541
00:56:03,420 --> 00:56:05,694
(She tried to lift her leg.)

1542
00:56:06,420 --> 00:56:08,394
(Swaying)

1543
00:56:08,460 --> 00:56:10,658
(The chair sank into the ground.)

1544
00:56:10,659 --> 00:56:13,988
(Gook Ju got all the attention, and Eun Su's alien dance evaporated.)

1545
00:56:13,989 --> 00:56:16,104
- They usually don't omit stuff. - Right?

1546
00:56:16,199 --> 00:56:17,359
Maybe it was really bad.

1547
00:56:17,360 --> 00:56:21,468
In order to redeem herself, she prepared another dance.

1548
00:56:21,469 --> 00:56:23,845
(It's time for Eun Su's dance to redeem herself.)

1549
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:25,309
Can we see it?

1550
00:56:25,310 --> 00:56:26,885
- Now? - Yes, now.

1551
00:56:27,009 --> 00:56:29,285
- As soon as I got here. - When then?

1552
00:56:29,310 --> 00:56:32,048
- You have to overcome it. - I have to. I'll overcome this.

1553
00:56:32,049 --> 00:56:33,109
- You have to overcome it. - I'll overcome this.

1554
00:56:33,110 --> 00:56:35,479
Do you see this? They are going to watch you dance...

1555
00:56:35,480 --> 00:56:37,095
with their arms crossed.

1556
00:56:38,219 --> 00:56:39,394
We're the judges.

1557
00:56:39,690 --> 00:56:41,318
We don't clap for everybody.

1558
00:56:41,319 --> 00:56:42,559
We're the judges.

1559
00:56:42,560 --> 00:56:43,988
We are frank.

1560
00:56:43,989 --> 00:56:45,888
- Be quiet. - What?

1561
00:56:45,889 --> 00:56:47,459
Be quiet.

1562
00:56:47,460 --> 00:56:49,135
- Be quiet. - I said one thing.

1563
00:56:49,299 --> 00:56:50,399
Kwang Soo keep your voice down.

1564
00:56:50,400 --> 00:56:52,399
- Eun Su. - I didn't want to be edited out,

1565
00:56:52,400 --> 00:56:53,968
- so I prepared extra hard. - I see.

1566
00:56:53,969 --> 00:56:55,669
Let's watch Eun Su. Please give her a round of applause.

1567
00:56:55,670 --> 00:56:56,868
All right.

1568
00:56:56,869 --> 00:56:58,508
- Ready? - What's this?

1569
00:56:58,509 --> 00:57:01,368
- What's with the corduroy shirt? - She prepared a lot.

1570
00:57:01,369 --> 00:57:02,579
(She takes her jacket off.)

1571
00:57:02,580 --> 00:57:03,738
Top and bottom.

1572
00:57:03,739 --> 00:57:06,124
I haven't seen a corduroy top and bottom in a while.

1573
00:57:06,409 --> 00:57:08,879
Eun Su looks nice in it.

1574
00:57:08,880 --> 00:57:12,118
She's determined.

1575
00:57:12,119 --> 00:57:14,149
Do you know the dance moves perfectly?

1576
00:57:14,150 --> 00:57:16,388
- I think she took lessons. - Yesterday,

1577
00:57:16,389 --> 00:57:18,588
- I went to a dance academy. - A dance academy?

1578
00:57:18,589 --> 00:57:20,365
- A dance academy. - I took a last-minute lesson.

1579
00:57:20,989 --> 00:57:22,834
(I took lessons too.)

1580
00:57:23,199 --> 00:57:25,129
Let's watch. Please take a few steps back.

1581
00:57:25,130 --> 00:57:26,568
This is our dance.

1582
00:57:26,569 --> 00:57:28,914
(Eun Su's new dance time to redeem for the last time.)

1583
00:57:29,770 --> 00:57:30,899
- I don't hear it. - Is it the same?

1584
00:57:30,900 --> 00:57:32,084
(Turning)

1585
00:57:33,009 --> 00:57:35,008
(Her gesture is provocative.)

1586
00:57:35,009 --> 00:57:37,008
- I like her facial expression. - She prepared this.

1587
00:57:37,009 --> 00:57:38,649
It looks like she took lessons.

1588
00:57:38,650 --> 00:57:40,624
Hold on.

1589
00:57:41,719 --> 00:57:43,718
(Wriggling)

1590
00:57:43,719 --> 00:57:47,519
(She shows off the tadpole dance with determination.)

1591
00:57:47,520 --> 00:57:50,095
(What is that?)

1592
00:57:50,989 --> 00:57:52,258
Goodness.

1593
00:57:52,259 --> 00:57:53,289
(The song changes.)

1594
00:57:53,290 --> 00:57:55,635
(She's full of energy.)

1595
00:57:55,759 --> 00:57:57,258
What?

1596
00:57:57,259 --> 00:57:59,129
- Why are you doing this? - Eun Su.

1597
00:57:59,130 --> 00:58:00,298
What's wrong?

1598
00:58:00,299 --> 00:58:02,214
(She shows a strange movement.)

1599
00:58:02,869 --> 00:58:04,638
- Why are you doing this? - Eun Su.

1600
00:58:04,639 --> 00:58:05,738
- What's wrong? - Why are you doing this?

1601
00:58:05,739 --> 00:58:07,109
Was this necessary?

1602
00:58:07,110 --> 00:58:08,109
Look.

1603
00:58:08,110 --> 00:58:09,508
- Is she dead? - What's wrong?

1604
00:58:09,509 --> 00:58:10,854
Is she dead?

1605
00:58:10,880 --> 00:58:12,309
- Is she dead? - Was this necessary?

1606
00:58:12,310 --> 00:58:13,555
What's wrong?

1607
00:58:13,750 --> 00:58:15,379
- She's alive. - What are you doing?

1608
00:58:15,380 --> 00:58:16,919
She's alive.

1609
00:58:16,920 --> 00:58:19,919
- Be quiet. - She shushed us.

1610
00:58:19,920 --> 00:58:21,564
She's a good dancer.

1611
00:58:21,889 --> 00:58:23,189
(She finishes off with a hot dance.)

1612
00:58:23,190 --> 00:58:24,388
Stop it.

1613
00:58:24,389 --> 00:58:25,588
- Stop it. - You're good.

1614
00:58:25,589 --> 00:58:27,258
You can finish, Eun Su.

1615
00:58:27,259 --> 00:58:29,359
(She's not done yet.)

1616
00:58:29,360 --> 00:58:32,175
(This is the real end.)

1617
00:58:33,029 --> 00:58:34,298
All right.

1618
00:58:34,299 --> 00:58:35,468
She's good.

1619
00:58:35,469 --> 00:58:37,599
She's good, but something's funny.

1620
00:58:37,600 --> 00:58:40,408
I've never seen anybody try so hard.

1621
00:58:40,409 --> 00:58:43,055
- Give her a round of applause. - Thank you.

1622
00:58:43,639 --> 00:58:44,879
She tried hard.

1623
00:58:44,880 --> 00:58:47,149
Eun Su is ambitious.

1624
00:58:47,150 --> 00:58:49,519
I thought she was going to be shy, but when we got close,

1625
00:58:49,520 --> 00:58:51,318
she shushed us. She had to focus on dancing.

1626
00:58:51,319 --> 00:58:52,649
I couldn't hear the music well.

1627
00:58:52,650 --> 00:58:54,689
- I see. - She's good.

1628
00:58:54,690 --> 00:58:58,088
Choi Ri, why did you copy her dance?

1629
00:58:58,089 --> 00:58:59,658
I got excited.

1630
00:58:59,659 --> 00:59:02,104
- Really? - She couldn't stay still.

1631
00:59:02,799 --> 00:59:06,975
(She got excited.)

1632
00:59:07,699 --> 00:59:08,698
Are you a good dancer?

1633
00:59:08,699 --> 00:59:09,899
Do you want some music?

1634
00:59:09,900 --> 00:59:11,198
- I... - Freestyle dance?

1635
00:59:11,199 --> 00:59:12,368
Freestyle?

1636
00:59:12,369 --> 00:59:14,669
- I prepared... - You did?

1637
00:59:14,670 --> 00:59:16,039
- a Korean dance. - You can do whatever.

1638
00:59:16,040 --> 00:59:17,908
- Try it. - Korean dance.

1639
00:59:17,909 --> 00:59:20,109
I'll be dancing to IU's song.

1640
00:59:20,110 --> 00:59:22,149
- Really? - She prepared something.

1641
00:59:22,150 --> 00:59:24,948
- How does this go? - You have to...

1642
00:59:24,949 --> 00:59:26,064
I'll do it.

1643
00:59:26,319 --> 00:59:27,749
- Go away. - Are you her boyfriend?

1644
00:59:27,750 --> 00:59:29,459
I'm not.

1645
00:59:29,460 --> 00:59:31,265
(Are you her boyfriend?)

1646
00:59:31,759 --> 00:59:34,189
(So Min pulls him back in anger.)

1647
00:59:34,190 --> 00:59:35,999
(Waddling back)

1648
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:37,928
- He was worried... - Come here.

1649
00:59:37,929 --> 00:59:39,368
- I was stealing his time. - Don't do it. Come back.

1650
00:59:39,369 --> 00:59:40,968
You were all the way back there.

1651
00:59:40,969 --> 00:59:42,099
They...

1652
00:59:42,100 --> 00:59:43,999
- gave it to me. - I lost a camera shot.

1653
00:59:44,000 --> 00:59:45,609
- He told me to move. - Hey.

1654
00:59:45,610 --> 00:59:47,309
You never help me with anything.

1655
00:59:47,310 --> 00:59:48,879
- Do something then. - You never do.

1656
00:59:48,880 --> 00:59:51,185
- You're wrong. - So Min is...

1657
00:59:51,210 --> 00:59:52,979
So Min is actually not interested in you.

1658
00:59:52,980 --> 00:59:54,185
You know, right?

1659
00:59:54,380 --> 00:59:55,879
- She's just saying that. - She is.

1660
00:59:55,880 --> 00:59:57,618
- She's just saying that. - For Jinyoung to hear.

1661
00:59:57,619 --> 00:59:59,194
So that he gets jealous.

1662
00:59:59,750 --> 01:00:00,789
I know.

1663
01:00:00,790 --> 01:00:03,064
Jinyoung doesn't get jealous of anybody.

1664
01:00:03,389 --> 01:00:04,988
You got it.

1665
01:00:04,989 --> 01:00:06,535
- Choi Ri. - She's ready.

1666
01:00:07,130 --> 01:00:08,729
It's pretty.

1667
01:00:08,730 --> 01:00:09,999
I think this is better.

1668
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:11,769
Really? I should go around like this.

1669
01:00:11,770 --> 01:00:14,729
- Did you learn Korean dance? - Yes, I majored in it.

1670
01:00:14,730 --> 01:00:17,138
- She majored in it. - Let's watch Choi Ri dance.

1671
01:00:17,139 --> 01:00:18,914
- Yes. - Her fingertips look nice.

1672
01:00:19,210 --> 01:00:20,539
She's serious.

1673
01:00:20,540 --> 01:00:22,055
She's really pretty.

1674
01:00:24,779 --> 01:00:27,908
(The atmosphere changes.)

1675
01:00:27,909 --> 01:00:31,225
(This is an elegant turn.)

1676
01:00:32,119 --> 01:00:33,388
She's serious.

1677
01:00:33,389 --> 01:00:34,849
(She's so pretty.)

1678
01:00:34,850 --> 01:00:36,118
She has a nice figure.

1679
01:00:36,119 --> 01:00:37,559
She looks cool.

1680
01:00:37,560 --> 01:00:39,334
(Her dance is beautiful as she's a seasoned dancer.)

1681
01:00:44,630 --> 01:00:45,928
(She jumps lightly...)

1682
01:00:45,929 --> 01:00:48,028
(and turns.)

1683
01:00:48,029 --> 01:00:53,008
(She finishes off gracefully.)

1684
01:00:53,009 --> 01:00:55,508
(They're amazed.)

1685
01:00:55,509 --> 01:00:56,709
(That was different from the excited version of her.)

1686
01:00:56,710 --> 01:00:58,754
That was the most serious dance I've seen.

1687
01:00:59,810 --> 01:01:02,618
- She looks different. - Look at Seok Jin.

1688
01:01:02,619 --> 01:01:05,019
That was so pretty.

1689
01:01:05,020 --> 01:01:07,388
Eun Su, did you take dance too?

1690
01:01:07,389 --> 01:01:09,658
- I did Korean dance too. - Really?

1691
01:01:09,659 --> 01:01:12,459
For a short time in high school.

1692
01:01:12,460 --> 01:01:13,758
I took it for two years.

1693
01:01:13,759 --> 01:01:15,599
- That's not a short time. - That's a very long time.

1694
01:01:15,600 --> 01:01:18,298
Eun Su, can I ask you to dance for us?

1695
01:01:18,299 --> 01:01:19,928
Can you?

1696
01:01:19,929 --> 01:01:21,769
I took it for two months.

1697
01:01:21,770 --> 01:01:22,899
- You did? - At a welfare center.

1698
01:01:22,900 --> 01:01:25,508
- You too? - I learned at the welfare center.

1699
01:01:25,509 --> 01:01:26,908
Show us.

1700
01:01:26,909 --> 01:01:27,908
(From the welfare center)

1701
01:01:27,909 --> 01:01:29,055
Hey.

1702
01:01:29,139 --> 01:01:30,638
- So Min. - Why?

1703
01:01:30,639 --> 01:01:31,879
She learned it at the welfare center.

1704
01:01:31,880 --> 01:01:32,879
For two months.

1705
01:01:32,880 --> 01:01:35,379
- At the welfare center? - She learned it for two months.

1706
01:01:35,380 --> 01:01:36,419
- Two months. - At the welfare center.

1707
01:01:36,420 --> 01:01:37,749
You should show us too then.

1708
01:01:37,750 --> 01:01:39,618
Everybody who took lessons should go up and dance.

1709
01:01:39,619 --> 01:01:41,218
It's rare for all these people to be in one place.

1710
01:01:41,219 --> 01:01:43,158
I'm curious what you learned at the welfare center.

1711
01:01:43,159 --> 01:01:47,088
There aren't that many celebrities who majored in Korean dance.

1712
01:01:47,089 --> 01:01:48,829
Please cue the music.

1713
01:01:48,830 --> 01:01:49,829
If she learned for two years,

1714
01:01:49,830 --> 01:01:51,629
- she must have a nice figure. - That's a long time.

1715
01:01:51,630 --> 01:01:53,028
That's a long time.

1716
01:01:53,029 --> 01:01:54,475
She's a good dancer too.

1717
01:01:55,270 --> 01:01:57,198
She's a good dancer.

1718
01:01:57,199 --> 01:01:58,198
She's a bird.

1719
01:01:58,199 --> 01:02:01,738
Her gaze is soft.

1720
01:02:01,739 --> 01:02:03,115
You need to wear a hanbok.

1721
01:02:03,139 --> 01:02:04,838
(She does a successful turn.)

1722
01:02:04,839 --> 01:02:06,209
She's good.

1723
01:02:06,210 --> 01:02:07,879
- You know when you watch them turn. - She's good.

1724
01:02:07,880 --> 01:02:10,019
She's a good dancer.

1725
01:02:10,020 --> 01:02:11,825
She learned to dance.

1726
01:02:12,290 --> 01:02:14,225
That was unplanned.

1727
01:02:14,420 --> 01:02:16,258
- She's lying down. - Is she lying down again?

1728
01:02:16,259 --> 01:02:17,689
That was unplanned.

1729
01:02:17,690 --> 01:02:19,658
(Collapsing)

1730
01:02:19,659 --> 01:02:21,129
- Don't lie down. - Eun Su, stop lying down.

1731
01:02:21,130 --> 01:02:22,499
Get up.

1732
01:02:22,500 --> 01:02:24,729
Eun Su, get up.

1733
01:02:24,730 --> 01:02:26,698
It's the same dance as before, but slower.

1734
01:02:26,699 --> 01:02:28,399
Eun Su, get up.

1735
01:02:28,400 --> 01:02:30,769
It's the same dance, but slower.

1736
01:02:30,770 --> 01:02:33,109
If you keep putting your face on the cold floor, your mouth will turn.

1737
01:02:33,110 --> 01:02:34,709
The welfare center version.

1738
01:02:34,710 --> 01:02:36,209
- Eun Su, it's cold. - Good job.

1739
01:02:36,210 --> 01:02:38,579
(She might get a facial nerve palsy. The welfare center dancer is next.)

1740
01:02:38,580 --> 01:02:40,048
She learned for two months.

1741
01:02:40,049 --> 01:02:41,408
The welfare center version.

1742
01:02:41,409 --> 01:02:43,118
- Do I have to look nice? - The welfare center version.

1743
01:02:43,119 --> 01:02:45,919
- Does she have to look nice? - You can leave your jacket on.

1744
01:02:45,920 --> 01:02:48,048
Hey, just do it.

1745
01:02:48,049 --> 01:02:50,388
- I need to show my figure. - What figure?

1746
01:02:50,389 --> 01:02:51,928
It's better not to show it.

1747
01:02:51,929 --> 01:02:54,388
- Jinyoung took her jacket. - You're not even that good.

1748
01:02:54,389 --> 01:02:55,559
(Oh, dear.)

1749
01:02:55,560 --> 01:02:58,099
Did you see her? When Jinyoung handed her the microphone.

1750
01:02:58,100 --> 01:03:00,269
(She tried to act cute.)

1751
01:03:00,270 --> 01:03:01,399
I hate this.

1752
01:03:01,400 --> 01:03:03,368
- Let's watch what she learned. - Gosh, So Min.

1753
01:03:03,369 --> 01:03:04,838
She took off her shoes too.

1754
01:03:04,839 --> 01:03:06,138
What's wrong with your socks?

1755
01:03:06,139 --> 01:03:07,269
They're kind of small for you.

1756
01:03:07,270 --> 01:03:08,508
Your toes are about to pop out.

1757
01:03:08,509 --> 01:03:10,785
- They're sharp. - So Min, are your toes bleeding?

1758
01:03:11,009 --> 01:03:12,584
I think they're about to bleed.

1759
01:03:12,750 --> 01:03:14,678
- They're sharp. - Pedicure.

1760
01:03:14,679 --> 01:03:16,149
- I think they're bleeding. - So Min.

1761
01:03:16,150 --> 01:03:17,725
- Will I remember? - So Min, are your toes bleeding?

1762
01:03:17,819 --> 01:03:19,888
(She shows off her see-through socks before revealing her dance.)

1763
01:03:19,889 --> 01:03:21,325
Two months at the welfare center.

1764
01:03:21,489 --> 01:03:22,635
Look at her facial expression.

1765
01:03:22,719 --> 01:03:24,388
- You have to look serious. - Look serious.

1766
01:03:24,389 --> 01:03:27,088
- Look at her figure. - Is this really Korean dance?

1767
01:03:27,089 --> 01:03:29,104
I can see it.

1768
01:03:29,759 --> 01:03:31,528
It's too unnatural.

1769
01:03:31,529 --> 01:03:32,774
Hey, So Min!

1770
01:03:33,270 --> 01:03:34,729
- Wait a minute. - Hold on.

1771
01:03:34,730 --> 01:03:36,939
Hey, So Min!

1772
01:03:36,940 --> 01:03:39,385
(My goodness!)

1773
01:03:39,670 --> 01:03:41,138
- Hold on. - Your armpits are sweaty!

1774
01:03:41,139 --> 01:03:43,015
(Your armpits are sweaty!)

1775
01:03:43,409 --> 01:03:46,425
(Stop right there.)

1776
01:03:46,779 --> 01:03:48,149
(They protect So Min.)

1777
01:03:48,150 --> 01:03:49,354
Come out.

1778
01:03:49,619 --> 01:03:51,618
(So Min's sweaty armpits bring chaos.)

1779
01:03:51,619 --> 01:03:52,995
- So Min. - Hey!

1780
01:03:53,089 --> 01:03:54,789
- Hey. - What is up with you?

1781
01:03:54,790 --> 01:03:55,789
(So Min, put this on.)

1782
01:03:55,790 --> 01:03:57,464
You must have been very nervous.

1783
01:03:57,489 --> 01:03:58,734
What is up with you?

1784
01:03:58,830 --> 01:04:00,959
This is the end. This is the end.

1785
01:04:00,960 --> 01:04:02,758
- I thought I was seeing things. - Don't say anything.

1786
01:04:02,759 --> 01:04:04,129
This has to be a lie.

1787
01:04:04,130 --> 01:04:05,198
I mean...

1788
01:04:05,199 --> 01:04:06,405
- I was so startled. - So Min.

1789
01:04:06,630 --> 01:04:07,905
- Hey. - Your armpits...

1790
01:04:08,170 --> 01:04:11,039
You must have been very nervous.

1791
01:04:11,040 --> 01:04:12,185
Jinyoung.

1792
01:04:12,369 --> 01:04:13,944
She is easygoing, right?

1793
01:04:14,040 --> 01:04:15,245
She is unaffected.

1794
01:04:17,440 --> 01:04:19,024
Stop it already.

1795
01:04:19,080 --> 01:04:21,584
It looked as if there was dried seaweed on her armpit.

1796
01:04:22,779 --> 01:04:24,854
- Dried seaweed. - Stop it already.

1797
01:04:26,150 --> 01:04:28,048
I was like, "Did it come from gimbap?"

1798
01:04:28,049 --> 01:04:29,158
Seriously.

1799
01:04:29,159 --> 01:04:34,629
It wasn't a small piece, but a big piece for making gimbap.

1800
01:04:34,630 --> 01:04:37,329
Just think of it as a part of the design.

1801
01:04:37,330 --> 01:04:38,868
"A big piece for making gimbap"!

1802
01:04:38,869 --> 01:04:40,075
It was the shade.

1803
01:04:40,100 --> 01:04:41,428
It was just the shade on her armpits.

1804
01:04:41,429 --> 01:04:42,568
Okay.

1805
01:04:42,569 --> 01:04:44,975
- She broke out in a sweat. - I mean...

1806
01:04:45,100 --> 01:04:48,444
I realized how nervous So Min is today.

1807
01:04:48,710 --> 01:04:49,809
Her armpits showed us.

1808
01:04:49,810 --> 01:04:51,579
You should use deodorant.

1809
01:04:51,580 --> 01:04:52,885
Deodorant.

1810
01:04:52,909 --> 01:04:55,048
- Jinyoung brought her shoes. - Jinyoung.

1811
01:04:55,049 --> 01:04:56,455
He has manners.

1812
01:04:56,580 --> 01:04:59,294
Why did you point it out?

1813
01:04:59,520 --> 01:05:00,919
Why did this happen today...

1814
01:05:00,920 --> 01:05:02,559
when Jinyoung is here? I am going crazy.

1815
01:05:02,560 --> 01:05:04,488
- You took off your jacket. - Seriously.

1816
01:05:04,489 --> 01:05:06,129
Why did you take off your jacket? You should've kept it on.

1817
01:05:06,130 --> 01:05:08,459
She didn't raise her arms much.

1818
01:05:08,460 --> 01:05:10,428
Her sweaty armpits became obvious at this pose.

1819
01:05:10,429 --> 01:05:11,559
(Suppressing her anger)

1820
01:05:11,560 --> 01:05:13,129
- Everyone on that side saw it. - I wondered...

1821
01:05:13,130 --> 01:05:14,729
- if she broke out in a sweat. - The left side was relatively dry.

1822
01:05:14,730 --> 01:05:16,238
- My goodness. - She was nervous.

1823
01:05:16,239 --> 01:05:18,769
It's your first visit to the show, Choi Ri.

1824
01:05:18,770 --> 01:05:21,838
- Yes, it's my first visit. - Please introduce yourself.

1825
01:05:21,839 --> 01:05:23,138
My full name...

1826
01:05:23,139 --> 01:05:25,579
has 2 words instead of 3 words.

1827
01:05:25,580 --> 01:05:27,055
It's Choi Ri.

1828
01:05:27,580 --> 01:05:29,118
- Choi Ri. - Yes.

1829
01:05:29,119 --> 01:05:30,849
Are you from Busan?

1830
01:05:30,850 --> 01:05:32,925
- I am from Geochang. - Geochang.

1831
01:05:34,389 --> 01:05:36,734
- What a coincidence! - What do you mean?

1832
01:05:36,790 --> 01:05:38,959
- The guests' hometowns. - Gyeongsang Province?

1833
01:05:38,960 --> 01:05:41,035
Choi Ri is from Geochang. Eun Su is from Busan.

1834
01:05:41,060 --> 01:05:43,004
- Tongyeong. - He is from Tongyeong.

1835
01:05:43,029 --> 01:05:45,468
- Jinhae. - Are you from Jinhae?

1836
01:05:45,469 --> 01:05:48,269
Let's have a battle of three-line poems in a dialect.

1837
01:05:48,270 --> 01:05:49,738
(A battle of three-line poems in a dialect)

1838
01:05:49,739 --> 01:05:51,515
- It will be fun. - Now...

1839
01:05:51,739 --> 01:05:53,785
- Kyeong Hwan should show us. - Kyeong Hwan, let's go.

1840
01:05:54,069 --> 01:05:56,138
- You can do it, right? - Kyeong Hwan, show us.

1841
01:05:56,139 --> 01:05:58,508
- Does it need to be in a dialect? - Yes.

1842
01:05:58,509 --> 01:05:59,908
- Show us how it's done. - Okay.

1843
01:05:59,909 --> 01:06:02,048
- Can you make one about Se Chan? - Se Chan?

1844
01:06:02,049 --> 01:06:03,778
Okay, I'll do one about Se Chan.

1845
01:06:03,779 --> 01:06:06,289
- Is there something you prepared? - Se Chan.

1846
01:06:06,290 --> 01:06:08,294
- I will make one about Se Chan. - Se Chan.

1847
01:06:08,489 --> 01:06:09,694
The first line.

1848
01:06:10,020 --> 01:06:11,334
Yang Se Chan, it has been a while.

1849
01:06:12,659 --> 01:06:13,964
Yang Se Chan, it has been a while.

1850
01:06:14,759 --> 01:06:15,905
Have you been well?

1851
01:06:16,130 --> 01:06:17,874
- It really is a dialect. - The second line.

1852
01:06:18,330 --> 01:06:19,575
Did you wash your face?

1853
01:06:19,600 --> 01:06:21,144
Your face doesn't look so clean.

1854
01:06:21,699 --> 01:06:22,975
The third line.

1855
01:06:23,799 --> 01:06:25,444
Go and wash your face with cold water.

1856
01:06:26,409 --> 01:06:27,544
The third line.

1857
01:06:28,469 --> 01:06:30,015
Go and wash your face with cold water.

1858
01:06:31,179 --> 01:06:32,425
What was that?

1859
01:06:33,110 --> 01:06:34,508
You didn't wash your face, right?

1860
01:06:34,509 --> 01:06:35,778
Wash your face with cold water!

1861
01:06:35,779 --> 01:06:37,754
Kyeong Hwan, wash your face with cold water.

1862
01:06:38,949 --> 01:06:41,194
- Wash your face with cold water. - Wouldn't it be too cold in winter?

1863
01:06:41,520 --> 01:06:44,318
- He lacks wits. - He can't be perfect.

1864
01:06:44,319 --> 01:06:46,059
- He can't be perfect. - It was nice.

1865
01:06:46,060 --> 01:06:48,234
Jinyoung, it's your turn.

1866
01:06:48,259 --> 01:06:49,604
What should it be about?

1867
01:06:49,799 --> 01:06:51,198
- So Min. - So Min?

1868
01:06:51,199 --> 01:06:53,729
It will be hard to make one about me.

1869
01:06:53,730 --> 01:06:54,928
Jeon So Min.

1870
01:06:54,929 --> 01:06:57,269
- Gosh, she worries about him. - Use a dialect.

1871
01:06:57,270 --> 01:06:58,368
The last line will be hard.

1872
01:06:58,369 --> 01:06:59,709
(Jinyoung will make a three-line poem about So Min.)

1873
01:06:59,710 --> 01:07:01,714
- The first line. - So Min.

1874
01:07:02,409 --> 01:07:03,609
"So Min."

1875
01:07:03,610 --> 01:07:06,008
(He exudes manly charms.)

1876
01:07:06,009 --> 01:07:07,185
The second line.

1877
01:07:07,250 --> 01:07:11,995
Although your armpits became sweaty,

1878
01:07:13,489 --> 01:07:15,019
We were past that. Why did you bring that up again?

1879
01:07:15,020 --> 01:07:16,635
- "Your armpits became sweaty." - We could have edited it out.

1880
01:07:17,360 --> 01:07:18,535
The third line.

1881
01:07:19,290 --> 01:07:20,435
Don't be embarrassed.

1882
01:07:22,630 --> 01:07:25,629
(So Min, don't be embarrassed.)

1883
01:07:25,630 --> 01:07:28,229
(He captivated women's hearts.)

1884
01:07:28,230 --> 01:07:30,144
- It was good. - It was good.

1885
01:07:30,469 --> 01:07:32,245
It was witty.

1886
01:07:32,369 --> 01:07:36,079
He mixed the dialect and the standard Korean.

1887
01:07:36,080 --> 01:07:39,084
The three guests struggled a lot so that Jinyoung could shine.

1888
01:07:39,449 --> 01:07:40,809
I didn't make a three-line poem.

1889
01:07:40,810 --> 01:07:42,718
(He feigns ignorance.)

1890
01:07:42,719 --> 01:07:45,479
(He has a feeling his poem will get edited out.)

1891
01:07:45,480 --> 01:07:47,124
"Go and wash your face with cold water."

1892
01:07:47,650 --> 01:07:49,564
Among comedians,

1893
01:07:49,589 --> 01:07:51,218
Kyeong Hwan is known as a comedian...

1894
01:07:51,219 --> 01:07:53,734
- who makes comedians laugh. - You are too kind.

1895
01:07:54,089 --> 01:07:58,205
I haven't made the public laugh in over 10 years.

1896
01:07:58,630 --> 01:07:59,829
(The comedians' comedian is shy before the public.)

1897
01:07:59,830 --> 01:08:01,399
I am still waiting for my chance.

1898
01:08:01,400 --> 01:08:03,975
- He is hilarious. - That was a good response.

1899
01:08:04,270 --> 01:08:06,368
That's great. Kyeong Hwan's story...

1900
01:08:06,369 --> 01:08:08,144
Why do you keep saying that? It isn't great.

1901
01:08:09,139 --> 01:08:10,778
- The atmosphere isn't great. - Jae Seok.

1902
01:08:10,779 --> 01:08:12,008
Jae Seok, are you sure it's great?

1903
01:08:12,009 --> 01:08:13,649
- He has many things to cover. - I mean...

1904
01:08:13,650 --> 01:08:15,178
- He has many things to cover. - Listen.

1905
01:08:15,179 --> 01:08:17,754
- "That's great." - I meant that...

1906
01:08:18,020 --> 01:08:20,464
it would be great if we wrap this up here.

1907
01:08:21,819 --> 01:08:24,189
(That was the hidden meaning.)

1908
01:08:24,190 --> 01:08:26,135
If you keep going, you will get edited out.

1909
01:08:26,159 --> 01:08:27,928
- Throw in the white towel. - That was enough.

1910
01:08:27,929 --> 01:08:29,459
No, no. I will keep going until the end.

1911
01:08:29,460 --> 01:08:30,675
I will keep going until 8pm.

1912
01:08:30,699 --> 01:08:33,044
(You should have wrapped it up there.)

1913
01:08:33,100 --> 01:08:34,774
The next guest we will introduce is...

1914
01:08:34,799 --> 01:08:36,245
Jinyoung of GOT7.

1915
01:08:37,100 --> 01:08:38,214
Finally.

1916
01:08:38,600 --> 01:08:39,738
(Awed)

1917
01:08:39,739 --> 01:08:43,238
GOT7 made a comeback with "You Calling My Name".

1918
01:08:43,239 --> 01:08:44,685
Let's give him a big hand.

1919
01:08:45,009 --> 01:08:46,185
Jinyoung.

1920
01:08:46,310 --> 01:08:48,649
- Please let us check out the song. - Of course.

1921
01:08:48,650 --> 01:08:50,394
Jinyoung of GOT7.

1922
01:08:50,650 --> 01:08:52,694
The dance is incredible.

1923
01:08:52,949 --> 01:08:54,019
There is music.

1924
01:08:54,020 --> 01:08:57,694
(So Min has been waiting for Jinyoung's solo performance.)

1925
01:08:57,960 --> 01:08:59,129
(He stretches his ankles.)

1926
01:08:59,130 --> 01:09:00,365
My goodness.

1927
01:09:00,790 --> 01:09:02,305
Even the way he warms up is different.

1928
01:09:03,429 --> 01:09:05,305
- His body is light. - It's light.

1929
01:09:05,670 --> 01:09:06,874
His body is light.

1930
01:09:07,199 --> 01:09:08,504
His body is light.

1931
01:09:09,600 --> 01:09:11,444
- It's light. - He isn't like us.

1932
01:09:12,239 --> 01:09:14,544
His body is light.

1933
01:09:15,980 --> 01:09:17,854
He jumps so lightly.

1934
01:09:17,880 --> 01:09:19,209
He is sexy.

1935
01:09:19,210 --> 01:09:21,055
(Every dance move shows a seasoned idol singer's sexiness.)

1936
01:09:22,919 --> 01:09:23,979
(My goodness!)

1937
01:09:23,980 --> 01:09:25,425
My goodness.

1938
01:09:26,650 --> 01:09:28,918
(So Min claps like a seal when he grinds his hips.)

1939
01:09:28,919 --> 01:09:30,565
(His jaw dropped.)

1940
01:09:33,429 --> 01:09:35,288
I see why So Min is crazy about him.

1941
01:09:35,289 --> 01:09:36,599
("You Calling My Name" by GOT7)

1942
01:09:36,600 --> 01:09:38,958
- He is good. - I see why she is crazy about him.

1943
01:09:38,959 --> 01:09:40,029
I don't know...

1944
01:09:40,030 --> 01:09:41,369
if you saw So Min.

1945
01:09:41,370 --> 01:09:42,945
When Jinyoung was getting ready,

1946
01:09:43,139 --> 01:09:44,374
she captured every moment with her eyes.

1947
01:09:45,370 --> 01:09:47,815
- She did it with her eyes. - Click.

1948
01:09:49,339 --> 01:09:50,979
(From the moment Jinyoung stretched his body,)

1949
01:09:50,980 --> 01:09:53,685
(So Min saved every moment in her heart.)

1950
01:09:53,749 --> 01:09:56,595
(So Min's eyes worked like a shutter.)

1951
01:09:56,879 --> 01:09:58,019
- She captured it with her eyes. - She saved it.

1952
01:09:58,020 --> 01:09:59,248
She captured it with her eyes.

1953
01:09:59,249 --> 01:10:01,888
I haven't seen So Min react that way in a while.

1954
01:10:01,889 --> 01:10:04,659
I think Se Chan is wary of Jinyoung.

1955
01:10:04,660 --> 01:10:05,758
- Why would I do that? - Why?

1956
01:10:05,759 --> 01:10:08,034
- He said he can dance to the song. - Okay.

1957
01:10:08,060 --> 01:10:09,874
- What are you talking about? - Se Chan, let's go.

1958
01:10:10,299 --> 01:10:11,498
(Will he do the fan-meet dance to this song?)

1959
01:10:11,499 --> 01:10:12,798
- What are you talking about? - Se Chan, let's go.

1960
01:10:12,799 --> 01:10:13,828
You said that.

1961
01:10:13,829 --> 01:10:15,574
- I can't dance. - You said that.

1962
01:10:15,629 --> 01:10:16,714
Play the song.

1963
01:10:16,770 --> 01:10:18,114
Play GOT7's song.

1964
01:10:19,039 --> 01:10:20,685
I can't believe Se Chan will dance.

1965
01:10:22,139 --> 01:10:23,578
I feel bad.

1966
01:10:23,579 --> 01:10:25,138
He will look so sloppy.

1967
01:10:25,139 --> 01:10:28,254
- I feel bad. - He will look so sloppy.

1968
01:10:28,709 --> 01:10:29,849
(What?)

1969
01:10:29,850 --> 01:10:31,994
(What is he doing?)

1970
01:10:32,350 --> 01:10:35,425
(He copies anything that looked cool.)

1971
01:10:35,919 --> 01:10:38,319
(Why does it look funny when he does it?)

1972
01:10:38,320 --> 01:10:39,435
That's good.

1973
01:10:39,959 --> 01:10:41,128
He knows what looks cool.

1974
01:10:41,129 --> 01:10:44,305
(Se Chan responds to Jinyoung's warmup.)

1975
01:10:44,929 --> 01:10:46,374
(I will let go of myself.)

1976
01:10:48,999 --> 01:10:51,345
(Wait, the dance suits the song.)

1977
01:10:53,810 --> 01:10:57,555
(He is making good use of the dance he learned.)

1978
01:10:59,249 --> 01:11:00,885
That's hilarious.

1979
01:11:01,079 --> 01:11:03,494
(I want to be a part of this.)

1980
01:11:03,820 --> 01:11:04,994
Get out of there.

1981
01:11:05,719 --> 01:11:07,065
Get out.

1982
01:11:07,690 --> 01:11:09,048
Get out.

1983
01:11:09,049 --> 01:11:10,689
That was hilarious.

1984
01:11:10,690 --> 01:11:12,559
- That was so much fun. - That was hilarious.

1985
01:11:12,560 --> 01:11:14,265
I couldn't help it because it's my favorite part.

1986
01:11:14,860 --> 01:11:16,534
- I am sorry. - How embarrassing!

1987
01:11:17,259 --> 01:11:19,029
(Why did you make me do this?)

1988
01:11:19,030 --> 01:11:20,769
- Wash your face. - I should wash my face.

1989
01:11:20,770 --> 01:11:22,128
That was embarrassing.

1990
01:11:22,129 --> 01:11:24,038
He looked cool. He looked cool.

1991
01:11:24,039 --> 01:11:26,084
I guess he really is wary of Jinyoung.

1992
01:11:26,240 --> 01:11:28,508
This is So Min's favorite situation.

1993
01:11:28,509 --> 01:11:30,008
- Why? - You danced for her.

1994
01:11:30,009 --> 01:11:31,254
You danced for her.

1995
01:11:31,339 --> 01:11:33,324
- Did I dance for her? - Listen.

1996
01:11:33,450 --> 01:11:35,678
- Se Chan danced for her. - That's right.

1997
01:11:35,679 --> 01:11:37,378
The situation became that way.

1998
01:11:37,379 --> 01:11:38,595
This is my day.

1999
01:11:39,150 --> 01:11:40,864
- This is my day. - Enjoy it.

2000
01:11:41,450 --> 01:11:42,635
All right.

2001
01:11:42,860 --> 01:11:44,864
So Min should get her hair dried.

2002
01:11:44,889 --> 01:11:46,288
- Why? - The top of her head is sweaty.

2003
01:11:46,289 --> 01:11:48,935
(The top of her head is sweaty.)

2004
01:11:48,959 --> 01:11:50,334
Her hair became limp.

2005
01:11:50,400 --> 01:11:52,235
The top of her head isn't the only place that is sweaty.

2006
01:11:52,829 --> 01:11:54,968
- My goodness. - Kwang Soo.

2007
01:11:54,969 --> 01:11:56,599
- My goodness. - Jinyoung...

2008
01:11:56,600 --> 01:11:59,244
- is fanning her head. - Don't be too nice.

2009
01:11:59,509 --> 01:12:01,138
- So Min. - Today...

2010
01:12:01,139 --> 01:12:03,508
Why did you even say you want to see Jinyoung?

2011
01:12:03,509 --> 01:12:05,784
For some reason, I am in a terrible condition today.

2012
01:12:06,650 --> 01:12:08,849
I don't know why.

2013
01:12:08,850 --> 01:12:11,319
It started when we talked about the welfare center.

2014
01:12:11,320 --> 01:12:13,494
Nothing is going my way.

2015
01:12:13,789 --> 01:12:15,095
What?

2016
01:12:15,860 --> 01:12:17,695
- What is Jung Min doing here? - He was on a radio program.

2017
01:12:18,560 --> 01:12:19,828
- Jung Min. - What are you doing here?

2018
01:12:19,829 --> 01:12:21,034
I was on a radio program.

2019
01:12:21,160 --> 01:12:23,758
(Park Jung Min was on his way home from a radio program.)

2020
01:12:23,759 --> 01:12:25,229
- Come, come. - Jung Min.

2021
01:12:25,230 --> 01:12:27,428
- "Tazza: One-Eyed Jacks". - This is cool.

2022
01:12:27,429 --> 01:12:29,638
They always make fun of me about "Tazza: One-Eyed Jacks"!

2023
01:12:29,639 --> 01:12:32,214
(Kwang Soo tells on the others.)

2024
01:12:32,839 --> 01:12:34,114
I am glad you are here.

2025
01:12:34,169 --> 01:12:35,645
They...

2026
01:12:36,240 --> 01:12:37,309
Jung Min.

2027
01:12:37,310 --> 01:12:38,809
They always make fun of me about "Tazza: One-Eyed Jacks".

2028
01:12:38,810 --> 01:12:40,008
I enjoyed the movie.

2029
01:12:40,009 --> 01:12:41,878
- "Tazza: One-Eyed Jacks". - I enjoyed the movie.

2030
01:12:41,879 --> 01:12:43,754
- I enjoyed it, Jung Min. - Seriously.

2031
01:12:43,850 --> 01:12:45,378
I really enjoyed it.

2032
01:12:45,379 --> 01:12:46,725
I might as well take off my pants here.

2033
01:12:47,389 --> 01:12:49,659
I really enjoyed it.

2034
01:12:49,660 --> 01:12:50,788
(Kwang Soo finally met an alley who starred in the same movie.)

2035
01:12:50,789 --> 01:12:52,065
"Tazza: One-Eyed Jacks".

2036
01:12:52,389 --> 01:12:54,765
- I can't believe it. - Jung Min.

2037
01:12:54,789 --> 01:12:56,859
Thank you. Thank you, Jung Min.

2038
01:12:56,860 --> 01:12:58,059
Thank you so much.

2039
01:12:58,060 --> 01:12:59,769
- Jung Min. - Please say good things about it.

2040
01:12:59,770 --> 01:13:00,998
- Thank you. - Of course.

2041
01:13:00,999 --> 01:13:02,374
I really enjoyed the movie.

2042
01:13:02,499 --> 01:13:04,414
I told everyone that the movie is fun.

2043
01:13:04,499 --> 01:13:06,809
Do you want to see So Min's sweaty armpits?

2044
01:13:06,810 --> 01:13:07,945
Stop it.

2045
01:13:08,110 --> 01:13:10,508
(Jung Min, do you like the water park?)

2046
01:13:10,509 --> 01:13:12,279
- Stop talking about her armpits. - Show him.

2047
01:13:12,280 --> 01:13:13,685
Stop it.

2048
01:13:13,910 --> 01:13:15,979
- Bye, Jung Min. - Take care.

2049
01:13:15,980 --> 01:13:17,178
(We thank Jung Min for dropping by despite his busy schedule.)

2050
01:13:17,179 --> 01:13:19,019
- He is the best. - We said hello...

2051
01:13:19,020 --> 01:13:20,819
- to every guest. - My goodness.

2052
01:13:20,820 --> 01:13:23,418
Now, let's get the race started.

2053
01:13:23,419 --> 01:13:25,735
Did you check out the ghost story in the preview?

2054
01:13:26,129 --> 01:13:27,928
- No, I didn't. - No.

2055
01:13:27,929 --> 01:13:29,435
(A ghost story appeared in a preview the day before the shoot.)

2056
01:13:29,530 --> 01:13:32,374
(Late night in the editing room of the production crew)

2057
01:13:32,459 --> 01:13:34,628
You don't know the ghost story of our TV station, SBS, right?

2058
01:13:34,629 --> 01:13:36,138
It's my first time hearing it.

2059
01:13:36,139 --> 01:13:37,939
You don't know about Clacking Ghost and Coughing Ghost?

2060
01:13:37,940 --> 01:13:39,168
No, I don't.

2061
01:13:39,169 --> 01:13:40,445
Listen.

2062
01:13:40,509 --> 01:13:43,239
A long time ago, a main producer and assistant director...

2063
01:13:43,240 --> 01:13:46,454
wrote a legendary proposal that guaranteed 40 percent TV ratings.

2064
01:13:46,650 --> 01:13:50,195
Another competing producer and a writer were envious of them.

2065
01:13:50,879 --> 01:13:53,119
One night, the competing producer and the writer...

2066
01:13:53,120 --> 01:13:54,464
eliminated them.

2067
01:13:56,160 --> 01:14:00,105
But the producer coughed a lot so his nickname was Coughy.

2068
01:14:00,289 --> 01:14:03,675
And the writer always wore heels so her nickname was Clacky.

2069
01:14:04,429 --> 01:14:06,305
And after they had gotten eliminated,

2070
01:14:06,499 --> 01:14:07,945
every night,

2071
01:14:08,499 --> 01:14:12,044
there were clacking and coughing sounds.

2072
01:14:12,270 --> 01:14:15,714
They are roaming around the building to find that proposal.

2073
01:14:15,940 --> 01:14:18,385
Didn't you guys twist the story too much?

2074
01:14:19,039 --> 01:14:20,254
Let's just go home.

2075
01:14:20,280 --> 01:14:21,624
Shall we? Let's go.

2076
01:14:26,620 --> 01:14:28,288
(Screaming)

2077
01:14:28,289 --> 01:14:29,788
(Coughing)

2078
01:14:29,789 --> 01:14:32,065
(Clacking)

2079
01:14:32,459 --> 01:14:34,428
(There's a ghost story surrounding the legendary project proposal.)

2080
01:14:34,429 --> 01:14:35,529
It's a ghost.

2081
01:14:35,530 --> 01:14:36,958
Today's race will be here at the TV station.

2082
01:14:36,959 --> 01:14:38,659
It's called "Ghost Story of a TV Station: Legendary Proposal"

2083
01:14:38,660 --> 01:14:41,899
You are producers and writers...

2084
01:14:41,900 --> 01:14:43,099
of "Dalim Man".

2085
01:14:43,100 --> 01:14:44,099
- We are? - Yes.

2086
01:14:44,100 --> 01:14:45,168
We are producers and writers?

2087
01:14:45,169 --> 01:14:46,968
Within the group are the main producer,

2088
01:14:46,969 --> 01:14:48,968
the assistant director, Coughing Ghost,

2089
01:14:48,969 --> 01:14:51,609
and Clacking Ghost who are ghosts from the story.

2090
01:14:51,610 --> 01:14:52,979
There is an assistant director?

2091
01:14:52,980 --> 01:14:55,479
I think I know who Coughing Ghost is.

2092
01:14:55,480 --> 01:14:58,149
- Who is it? - Seok Jin coughs a lot.

2093
01:14:58,150 --> 01:14:59,149
(He's Coughing Ghost.)

2094
01:14:59,150 --> 01:15:00,349
(He's 100 percent Coughing Ghost according to his symptoms.)

2095
01:15:00,350 --> 01:15:02,664
That's why I'm trying not to cough.

2096
01:15:02,919 --> 01:15:05,359
He coughs a lot.

2097
01:15:05,360 --> 01:15:07,758
You must eliminate Coughing Ghost and Clacking Ghost...

2098
01:15:07,759 --> 01:15:08,928
who wanted the proposal...

2099
01:15:08,929 --> 01:15:10,899
or if you find the proposal first,

2100
01:15:10,900 --> 01:15:12,529
the "Dalim Man" production crew wins.

2101
01:15:12,530 --> 01:15:14,229
On the other hand, if the producer gets eliminated...

2102
01:15:14,230 --> 01:15:17,269
or if Coughing or Clacking Ghosts find the proposal first, you lose.

2103
01:15:17,270 --> 01:15:20,239
The losing team gets the penalty.

2104
01:15:20,240 --> 01:15:21,269
(It's Coughing and Clacking Ghosts versus everybody else.)

2105
01:15:21,270 --> 01:15:23,638
We'll announce the team members...

2106
01:15:23,639 --> 01:15:25,878
for the first mission.

2107
01:15:25,879 --> 01:15:26,979
It's assigned.

2108
01:15:26,980 --> 01:15:28,349
First team is...

2109
01:15:28,350 --> 01:15:29,849
Jae Seok,

2110
01:15:29,850 --> 01:15:31,078
Seok Jin,

2111
01:15:31,079 --> 01:15:32,378
Se Chan,

2112
01:15:32,379 --> 01:15:33,418
and Eun Su.

2113
01:15:33,419 --> 01:15:34,689
(First team: Jae Seok, Seok Jin, Se Chan, and Eun Su)

2114
01:15:34,690 --> 01:15:36,619
- What's this? - This team combination...

2115
01:15:36,620 --> 01:15:38,189
If you just look at our faces,

2116
01:15:38,190 --> 01:15:40,428
Kwang Soo should have joined us.

2117
01:15:40,429 --> 01:15:41,888
- What are you talking about? - It's the four of us.

2118
01:15:41,889 --> 01:15:43,559
- No way. - Eun Su and the three of us.

2119
01:15:43,560 --> 01:15:44,729
Come this way.

2120
01:15:44,730 --> 01:15:45,828
(The teams were assigned by the production crew.)

2121
01:15:45,829 --> 01:15:47,399
(Second team: Jong Kook, So Min, Choi Ri, and Jinyoung)

2122
01:15:47,400 --> 01:15:49,369
(Third team: Kwang Soo, Haha, Ji Hyo, and Kyeong Hwan)

2123
01:15:49,370 --> 01:15:52,399
Jong Kook is on our team. We're the strongest.

2124
01:15:52,400 --> 01:15:54,168
These are the three teams.

2125
01:15:54,169 --> 01:15:56,578
You are the production crew of "Dalim Man".

2126
01:15:56,579 --> 01:15:58,609
There are Teams Producer, Writer, and New Producer...

2127
01:15:58,610 --> 01:16:00,178
for the first mission.

2128
01:16:00,179 --> 01:16:02,449
Please keep in mind the new producer is the youngest member...

2129
01:16:02,450 --> 01:16:05,479
and must wear a suit jacket during the mission.

2130
01:16:05,480 --> 01:16:08,794
Please pick your teams.

2131
01:16:08,820 --> 01:16:10,189
Let's play Race of Wits.

2132
01:16:10,190 --> 01:16:11,189
It's been a while.

2133
01:16:11,190 --> 01:16:13,159
If you lose, you are out.

2134
01:16:13,160 --> 01:16:15,588
- Get ready, - Does the winner get to decide?

2135
01:16:15,589 --> 01:16:16,958
set, go.

2136
01:16:16,959 --> 01:16:18,159
(Race of Wits starts.)

2137
01:16:18,160 --> 01:16:19,305
One.

2138
01:16:19,669 --> 01:16:20,769
Two.

2139
01:16:20,770 --> 01:16:21,874
Three.

2140
01:16:22,469 --> 01:16:25,168
- It's dangerous from 4. - 4!

2141
01:16:25,169 --> 01:16:26,515
(That was good timing.)

2142
01:16:26,709 --> 01:16:27,784
- 5. - 5.

2143
01:16:29,679 --> 01:16:31,038
(They were standing next to each other and lost.)

2144
01:16:31,039 --> 01:16:33,109
- Hey! - I was getting started.

2145
01:16:33,110 --> 01:16:34,678
- Goodness. - Jae Seok.

2146
01:16:34,679 --> 01:16:36,008
Go back.

2147
01:16:36,009 --> 01:16:38,178
- My gosh. - Jae Seok.

2148
01:16:38,179 --> 01:16:40,888
We're too old to be new producers.

2149
01:16:40,889 --> 01:16:41,888
Look at him.

2150
01:16:41,889 --> 01:16:43,059
He's...

2151
01:16:43,060 --> 01:16:44,088
He's the Chief Director.

2152
01:16:44,089 --> 01:16:46,559
He's almost the director.

2153
01:16:46,560 --> 01:16:47,805
I am.

2154
01:16:47,929 --> 01:16:49,328
The teams have been decided.

2155
01:16:49,329 --> 01:16:51,775
Please get changed before starting the race.

2156
01:16:52,600 --> 01:16:53,968
(Team Producer: Kwang Soo, Haha, Ji Hyo, and Kyeong Hwan)

2157
01:16:53,969 --> 01:16:54,968
(Team New Producer: Jae Seok, Seok Jin, Se Chan, and Eun Su)

2158
01:16:54,969 --> 01:16:56,145
(Team Writer: Jong Kook, So Min, Choi Ri, and Jinyoung)

2159
01:16:56,469 --> 01:16:58,214
Isn't this the entertainment headquarters?

2160
01:16:58,370 --> 01:17:00,109
This is the entertainment department.

2161
01:17:00,110 --> 01:17:01,508
This is the entertainment production department.

2162
01:17:01,509 --> 01:17:02,668
We're actually going to be here.

2163
01:17:02,669 --> 01:17:04,508
Production crew office of "Dalim Man".

2164
01:17:04,509 --> 01:17:06,449
- Right, we're "Dalim Man". - We are.

2165
01:17:06,450 --> 01:17:08,449
We're going to have a meeting.

2166
01:17:08,450 --> 01:17:09,718
- A reform meeting? - It's a meeting.

2167
01:17:09,719 --> 01:17:11,048
(2019 Reform Meeting)

2168
01:17:11,049 --> 01:17:12,494
What? A reform meeting?

2169
01:17:13,219 --> 01:17:14,989
- Is somebody getting fired? - Who's that on the bottom?

2170
01:17:14,990 --> 01:17:16,189
Look at that.

2171
01:17:16,190 --> 01:17:18,235
Seok Jin's name is on the bottom.

2172
01:17:18,759 --> 01:17:20,565
Why am I the only one down here?

2173
01:17:20,789 --> 01:17:22,504
That's what I was saying.

2174
01:17:22,560 --> 01:17:25,099
- We have seats. - We do?

2175
01:17:25,100 --> 01:17:27,145
- Writer. - New producer.

2176
01:17:27,400 --> 01:17:29,369
(Each person has a designated seat.)

2177
01:17:29,370 --> 01:17:31,239
- Writer one. - I'm a writer.

2178
01:17:31,240 --> 01:17:32,739
Jae Seok. We're producers.

2179
01:17:32,740 --> 01:17:34,869
Jae Seok, you are number one.

2180
01:17:34,870 --> 01:17:36,654
- Where do new producers go? - Please be quiet!

2181
01:17:36,740 --> 01:17:38,754
- New producers are here. - Where are we?

2182
01:17:39,179 --> 01:17:41,048
(It's messy.)

2183
01:17:41,049 --> 01:17:42,309
There are assigned seats.

2184
01:17:42,310 --> 01:17:44,725
New producers sit here.

2185
01:17:45,280 --> 01:17:47,425
Do writers all get laptops?

2186
01:17:47,520 --> 01:17:50,189
There are too many cords at our seats.

2187
01:17:50,190 --> 01:17:53,235
- You don't have laptops either. - We don't have laptops.

2188
01:17:53,360 --> 01:17:54,729
Goodness.

2189
01:17:54,730 --> 01:17:56,159
(He tries to wash away his sorrow with a beverage.)

2190
01:17:56,160 --> 01:17:58,059
- This is good. - You're not allowed to drink it.

2191
01:17:58,060 --> 01:17:59,175
(I feel better now.)

2192
01:17:59,400 --> 01:18:00,428
Where do I sit?

2193
01:18:00,429 --> 01:18:01,628
- Producer Yang. - Yes.

2194
01:18:01,629 --> 01:18:04,345
Get me some iced coffee.

2195
01:18:04,700 --> 01:18:06,744
That's an abuse of power.

2196
01:18:06,770 --> 01:18:08,239
- He's a new producer. - Look at that writer.

2197
01:18:08,240 --> 01:18:10,109
Hello!

2198
01:18:10,110 --> 01:18:13,525
Hello! I'm the new producer Jee Seok Jin.

2199
01:18:13,650 --> 01:18:15,248
(He tries to flatter his coworkers.)

2200
01:18:15,249 --> 01:18:16,248
I look forward to working with you.

2201
01:18:16,249 --> 01:18:18,178
I'm different from these guys.

2202
01:18:18,179 --> 01:18:21,124
I heard from somebody...

2203
01:18:21,219 --> 01:18:24,059
that you went through six TV stations.

2204
01:18:24,060 --> 01:18:25,388
- Rookie. - Yes?

2205
01:18:25,389 --> 01:18:27,428
You're talking like a CEO.

2206
01:18:27,429 --> 01:18:28,664
(How dare you?)

2207
01:18:28,690 --> 01:18:29,958
(He gets a warning for his bad attitude.)

2208
01:18:29,959 --> 01:18:32,435
He's just rude. I'll educate him.

2209
01:18:32,560 --> 01:18:33,928
Why don't you introduce yourself?

2210
01:18:33,929 --> 01:18:35,828
I'm a new producer,

2211
01:18:35,829 --> 01:18:37,239
but I'm not new.

2212
01:18:37,240 --> 01:18:38,269
Then?

2213
01:18:38,270 --> 01:18:41,069
In America...

2214
01:18:41,070 --> 01:18:42,508
I won't mention it.

2215
01:18:42,509 --> 01:18:43,809
He got stuck.

2216
01:18:43,810 --> 01:18:45,178
(He got stuck.)

2217
01:18:45,179 --> 01:18:47,409
He got stuck.

2218
01:18:47,410 --> 01:18:49,078
- Stop it. - He got stuck.

2219
01:18:49,079 --> 01:18:50,349
America what?

2220
01:18:50,350 --> 01:18:52,519
Excuse me,

2221
01:18:52,520 --> 01:18:54,189
but aren't you the producer for a fitness channel?

2222
01:18:54,190 --> 01:18:56,265
- Writer. - He's a writer.

2223
01:18:56,320 --> 01:18:57,895
He's the main writer.

2224
01:18:58,160 --> 01:19:00,258
Is he the main writer? I see.

2225
01:19:00,259 --> 01:19:01,559
My qualifications include...

2226
01:19:01,560 --> 01:19:03,699
We didn't ask. Stop talking.

2227
01:19:03,700 --> 01:19:05,404
I don't think qualifications matter.

2228
01:19:05,560 --> 01:19:08,229
I'm new here, so I'll try my best.

2229
01:19:08,230 --> 01:19:10,739
New producer one tries to stand out.

2230
01:19:10,740 --> 01:19:12,044
(New producer one tries to stand out.)

2231
01:19:12,700 --> 01:19:15,239
You said you're a new producer, but isn't this an age spot?

2232
01:19:15,240 --> 01:19:16,338
I'm a little bit older.

2233
01:19:16,339 --> 01:19:17,714
Are you married?

2234
01:19:17,940 --> 01:19:19,208
(Are you married?)

2235
01:19:19,209 --> 01:19:21,309
- I am. - Why would you ask that?

2236
01:19:21,310 --> 01:19:22,949
Dating isn't allowed at work.

2237
01:19:22,950 --> 01:19:24,378
Are you married?

2238
01:19:24,379 --> 01:19:25,494
Yes, I am.

2239
01:19:26,850 --> 01:19:29,288
(He doesn't give her a chance.)

2240
01:19:29,289 --> 01:19:31,435
I didn't think he was married.

2241
01:19:32,320 --> 01:19:34,805
Writer. Are you a writer?

2242
01:19:34,959 --> 01:19:36,088
Yes, I am.

2243
01:19:36,089 --> 01:19:37,834
I've never seen such a good-looking writer...

2244
01:19:38,030 --> 01:19:39,798
at a TV station.

2245
01:19:39,799 --> 01:19:41,105
He's married.

2246
01:19:41,499 --> 01:19:43,369
(So Min creates a love story as soon as she gets the chance.)

2247
01:19:43,370 --> 01:19:44,544
With whom?

2248
01:19:44,700 --> 01:19:48,439
(It's Jinyoung's turn to answer.)

2249
01:19:48,440 --> 01:19:49,909
With a producer. I didn't marry a writer.

2250
01:19:49,910 --> 01:19:51,154
You didn't?

2251
01:19:51,410 --> 01:19:53,678
(He bursts her bubble.)

2252
01:19:53,679 --> 01:19:54,985
Honey.

2253
01:19:56,280 --> 01:19:57,519
Jinyoung.

2254
01:19:57,520 --> 01:19:58,855
He drew the line.

2255
01:19:58,919 --> 01:20:00,464
Writer.

2256
01:20:00,650 --> 01:20:01,888
Jinyoung.

2257
01:20:01,889 --> 01:20:04,059
- I'm kidding. - He married a producer.

2258
01:20:04,060 --> 01:20:05,664
He's like me.

2259
01:20:05,959 --> 01:20:07,334
Excuse me, but are you a producer?

2260
01:20:07,360 --> 01:20:08,435
Yes.

2261
01:20:08,560 --> 01:20:10,029
- Why? - What's wrong?

2262
01:20:10,030 --> 01:20:11,229
What show did you produce?

2263
01:20:11,230 --> 01:20:12,258
"Darling Man".

2264
01:20:12,259 --> 01:20:13,699
(He's annoyed.)

2265
01:20:13,700 --> 01:20:15,599
- He said "Darling Man". - "Darling Man"?

2266
01:20:15,600 --> 01:20:17,498
- Dalnim? Or hatnim? - Dalnim?

2267
01:20:17,499 --> 01:20:19,445
It says "Dalim Man" here.

2268
01:20:19,910 --> 01:20:21,338
(What's wrong with all of you?)

2269
01:20:21,339 --> 01:20:23,239
- It's "Dalim Man". - Do you produce a children's show?

2270
01:20:23,240 --> 01:20:25,015
No, it's an adult show.

2271
01:20:25,780 --> 01:20:28,078
- An adult show? - An adult show.

2272
01:20:28,079 --> 01:20:30,218
He's preparing a subscription adult channel now.

2273
01:20:30,219 --> 01:20:31,449
Not that kind of adult show.

2274
01:20:31,450 --> 01:20:33,548
- It's for all ages. - I see.

2275
01:20:33,549 --> 01:20:35,288
I heard many rumors...

2276
01:20:35,289 --> 01:20:37,159
about how So Min proposes no ideas.

2277
01:20:37,160 --> 01:20:39,218
Me? I do everything. What are you talking about?

2278
01:20:39,219 --> 01:20:40,258
What shows were you a part of?

2279
01:20:40,259 --> 01:20:42,664
There's a show called "Sweaty Armpit Park".

2280
01:20:43,030 --> 01:20:45,628
(She's the main writer of "Sweaty Armpit Park".)

2281
01:20:45,629 --> 01:20:47,105
It's the best water park in the summer.

2282
01:20:47,169 --> 01:20:50,199
I recruit water parks...

2283
01:20:50,200 --> 01:20:51,668
in the summer.

2284
01:20:51,669 --> 01:20:53,038
- I plan games too. - I see.

2285
01:20:53,039 --> 01:20:55,269
Ding-dong. Here's an announcement.

2286
01:20:55,270 --> 01:20:57,614
(Pretend like this is an overhead announcement.)

2287
01:20:57,810 --> 01:21:00,925
Ding-dong. Here's an announcement.

2288
01:21:01,049 --> 01:21:03,578
Hello, "Dalim Man" production crew.

2289
01:21:03,579 --> 01:21:06,178
Here's the first mission to test the qualifications...

2290
01:21:06,179 --> 01:21:07,824
of an entertainment show production crew.

2291
01:21:07,950 --> 01:21:10,534
It's called Straight Face TV Station.

2292
01:21:11,990 --> 01:21:14,729
The producers, writers, and new producers...

2293
01:21:14,730 --> 01:21:17,498
will conduct the 2019 fall reform meeting...

2294
01:21:17,499 --> 01:21:19,099
for 30 minutes.

2295
01:21:19,100 --> 01:21:21,798
You are the level-headed crew of an entertainment show...

2296
01:21:21,799 --> 01:21:24,038
so you shouldn't laugh in any circumstance.

2297
01:21:24,039 --> 01:21:26,939
Whenever you laugh, you will get a penalty.

2298
01:21:26,940 --> 01:21:30,838
At the conclusion of 30 minutes, the team who laughed the least wins.

2299
01:21:30,839 --> 01:21:32,178
The hint that will be given to the winning team...

2300
01:21:32,179 --> 01:21:33,949
of this mission is the number of ghosts.

2301
01:21:33,950 --> 01:21:35,678
The winning team can pick one team of their choice...

2302
01:21:35,679 --> 01:21:37,279
besides their own team,

2303
01:21:37,280 --> 01:21:40,595
and check the number of ghosts within that team.

2304
01:21:41,450 --> 01:21:44,758
(This is a crucial opportunity to pick out the ghosts.)

2305
01:21:44,759 --> 01:21:48,229
(Everybody is keeping a straight face.)

2306
01:21:48,230 --> 01:21:50,534
(Giggling)

2307
01:21:51,360 --> 01:21:53,374
Jinyoung, we didn't do anything. Why are you laughing?

2308
01:21:53,600 --> 01:21:54,998
He's funny already.

2309
01:21:54,999 --> 01:21:56,869
(He's looking at Kwang Soo.)

2310
01:21:56,870 --> 01:21:58,298
- Am I funny? - His face?

2311
01:21:58,299 --> 01:21:59,439
No.

2312
01:21:59,440 --> 01:22:00,668
I was listening seriously.

2313
01:22:00,669 --> 01:22:02,439
This is funny. The atmosphere.

2314
01:22:02,440 --> 01:22:05,008
When I blow the whistle, the time starts.

2315
01:22:05,009 --> 01:22:06,979
If you laugh even when you try to make other people laugh,

2316
01:22:06,980 --> 01:22:10,449
you go outside and get the penalty. You'll rejoin the meeting after.

2317
01:22:10,450 --> 01:22:12,078
- Are you going to cry? - I don't laugh when I'm with you.

2318
01:22:12,079 --> 01:22:14,725
- Are you going to cry again? - I laugh when I see other people.

2319
01:22:15,049 --> 01:22:16,819
- It drove me nuts. - Are you going to cry again?

2320
01:22:16,820 --> 01:22:18,489
Ready, set...

2321
01:22:18,490 --> 01:22:19,765
I'm going to attack.

2322
01:22:20,490 --> 01:22:22,989
Let's resist first.

2323
01:22:22,990 --> 01:22:23,998
Do your gums have to show?

2324
01:22:23,999 --> 01:22:25,229
Yes.

2325
01:22:25,230 --> 01:22:27,668
There's some bad news in my family.

2326
01:22:27,669 --> 01:22:28,699
Really?

2327
01:22:28,700 --> 01:22:31,369
You dressed too colorfully despite the bad news.

2328
01:22:31,370 --> 01:22:32,845
(You dressed too colorfully despite the bad news.)

2329
01:22:33,339 --> 01:22:34,914
You did.

2330
01:22:35,270 --> 01:22:36,685
After my wife and I...

2331
01:22:37,110 --> 01:22:39,784
(They're about to laugh from the start.)

2332
01:22:39,980 --> 01:22:41,409
(He's in danger already.)

2333
01:22:41,410 --> 01:22:43,008
After my wife and I came back from a trip,

2334
01:22:43,009 --> 01:22:44,555
I don't feel that great.

2335
01:22:45,249 --> 01:22:46,819
(They are about to laugh over...)

2336
01:22:46,820 --> 01:22:48,918
(a very normal conversation.)

2337
01:22:48,919 --> 01:22:50,189
The new producers look like...

2338
01:22:50,190 --> 01:22:51,689
new comedians.

2339
01:22:51,690 --> 01:22:52,718
We are not.

2340
01:22:52,719 --> 01:22:53,788
We're producers.

2341
01:22:53,789 --> 01:22:55,788
Isn't he a comedian?

2342
01:22:55,789 --> 01:22:56,958
Me?

2343
01:22:56,959 --> 01:22:58,359
Is he a former comedian?

2344
01:22:58,360 --> 01:23:00,645
Producer, what is our reform meeting about?

2345
01:23:00,929 --> 01:23:02,199
Please conduct the meeting.

2346
01:23:02,200 --> 01:23:03,414
The reform is...

2347
01:23:03,570 --> 01:23:04,869
The lobster is on the crab's side.

2348
01:23:04,870 --> 01:23:06,544
(That was random.)

2349
01:23:09,110 --> 01:23:10,654
(That was a pun.)

2350
01:23:11,209 --> 01:23:12,555
(Laughing)

2351
01:23:13,450 --> 01:23:15,355
(I have to resist.)

2352
01:23:15,480 --> 01:23:16,895
- I'm sorry. - The lobster is on the crab's side.

2353
01:23:17,879 --> 01:23:19,964
Do you want to be funny?

2354
01:23:20,089 --> 01:23:22,095
(What's the penalty next door?)

2355
01:23:22,789 --> 01:23:23,788
What's this?

2356
01:23:23,789 --> 01:23:25,964
(The penalty is self dress-up.)

2357
01:23:26,219 --> 01:23:28,664
(Running Man's make-up team has everything you need.)

2358
01:23:28,959 --> 01:23:30,975
(They can dress themselves up in any funny way they want.)

2359
01:23:31,160 --> 01:23:33,945
If I knew this was the penalty, I would've held my laughter longer.

2360
01:23:34,799 --> 01:23:37,269
We told you to come up with ideas.

2361
01:23:37,270 --> 01:23:39,869
- Yes. - Start with the newbie's ideas.

2362
01:23:39,870 --> 01:23:42,015
- It's a test. This can be a test. - I...

2363
01:23:42,639 --> 01:23:44,239
(Seok Jin is about to present his idea.)

2364
01:23:44,240 --> 01:23:45,714
What are you doing?

2365
01:23:45,740 --> 01:23:47,748
(He's all over the place.)

2366
01:23:47,749 --> 01:23:49,678
I like trying out my ideas first.

2367
01:23:49,679 --> 01:23:51,378
I see. You take initiative.

2368
01:23:51,379 --> 01:23:52,779
You try out your ideas first.

2369
01:23:52,780 --> 01:23:54,248
Yes, I try them out first.

2370
01:23:54,249 --> 01:23:56,088
- That's a great attitude. - I experience them first.

2371
01:23:56,089 --> 01:23:57,159
- Right. - That's great.

2372
01:23:57,160 --> 01:23:58,989
That's the attitude new producers ought to have.

2373
01:23:58,990 --> 01:24:00,305
I...

2374
01:24:00,589 --> 01:24:01,864
(Snorting)

2375
01:24:02,759 --> 01:24:04,998
(He's trying to continue his presentation.)

2376
01:24:04,999 --> 01:24:07,869
(But he caught Kwang Soo's eyes.)

2377
01:24:07,870 --> 01:24:09,668
(Laughing)

2378
01:24:09,669 --> 01:24:10,699
You're out.

2379
01:24:10,700 --> 01:24:12,968
(Jae Seok heads to the penalty room after looking at Kwang Soo's face.)

2380
01:24:12,969 --> 01:24:14,008
Jae Seok is out.

2381
01:24:14,009 --> 01:24:16,168
He was presenting his idea. How can he laugh on his own?

2382
01:24:16,169 --> 01:24:18,654
- He laughs easily. - Yes.

2383
01:24:19,379 --> 01:24:20,748
- Go to the room. - I thought that you were ugly...

2384
01:24:20,749 --> 01:24:22,979
- for a moment. - All of a sudden?

2385
01:24:22,980 --> 01:24:24,119
I can understand that.

2386
01:24:24,120 --> 01:24:25,855
- You'll go in that costume? - Yes.

2387
01:24:26,620 --> 01:24:28,588
I told you to come up with an idea.

2388
01:24:28,589 --> 01:24:29,819
- Right. - Yes.

2389
01:24:29,820 --> 01:24:31,794
I didn't come here to do this.

2390
01:24:31,990 --> 01:24:34,428
I wonder if this is why I came to star on Running Man.

2391
01:24:34,429 --> 01:24:35,888
My gosh. Look at you.

2392
01:24:35,889 --> 01:24:37,458
I wonder if this is why I came to star on Running Man.

2393
01:24:37,459 --> 01:24:39,935
(A handsome beggar with a bald spot)

2394
01:24:40,129 --> 01:24:42,968
(His makeover is a bit sloppy as he's new to this.)

2395
01:24:42,969 --> 01:24:45,544
(But why is this so funny?)

2396
01:24:45,870 --> 01:24:47,685
(Trying hard not to laugh)

2397
01:24:48,009 --> 01:24:50,609
I didn't recognize him for a second when he walked in.

2398
01:24:50,610 --> 01:24:51,909
Ji Hyo, you're out.

2399
01:24:51,910 --> 01:24:53,809
(Ji Hyo ends up laughing at his sloppy makeover job.)

2400
01:24:53,810 --> 01:24:56,355
- I didn't laugh that much. - That was pretty quick.

2401
01:24:56,379 --> 01:24:58,378
I didn't know you looked handsome because of your hairstyle.

2402
01:24:58,379 --> 01:25:00,548
Of course. Hairstyles make men look handsome.

2403
01:25:00,549 --> 01:25:02,088
I didn't know you changed your hairstyle.

2404
01:25:02,089 --> 01:25:03,758
- No, no. - You look the same.

2405
01:25:03,759 --> 01:25:05,534
- Thank you. - You still look handsome.

2406
01:25:05,820 --> 01:25:07,958
- Why don't we continue? - All right.

2407
01:25:07,959 --> 01:25:09,859
- Here's a short presentation. - Sure.

2408
01:25:09,860 --> 01:25:11,998
- He has a lot of ideas. - That's great.

2409
01:25:11,999 --> 01:25:14,869
As for the water slap, the water comes out from the bottom.

2410
01:25:14,870 --> 01:25:17,699
But we have never done a real water "slap", per se.

2411
01:25:17,700 --> 01:25:19,369
- Hold on. Ideas... - So... Okay.

2412
01:25:19,370 --> 01:25:20,614
(Hold on. Ideas...)

2413
01:25:21,410 --> 01:25:23,168
- Hold on. Ideas... - So... Okay.

2414
01:25:23,169 --> 01:25:24,985
(Catching everyone's eyes)

2415
01:25:26,440 --> 01:25:28,979
(Goodness)

2416
01:25:28,980 --> 01:25:30,824
(Oh, no)

2417
01:25:31,049 --> 01:25:33,195
(Think about sad memories.)

2418
01:25:34,049 --> 01:25:36,695
(Jae Seok with a high nose bridge shows up.)

2419
01:25:37,389 --> 01:25:39,458
(Everyone keeps quiet as he confidently...)

2420
01:25:39,459 --> 01:25:40,529
(enters the room.)

2421
01:25:40,530 --> 01:25:42,888
- I went to the restroom just now. - Okay.

2422
01:25:42,889 --> 01:25:43,958
(I went to the restroom just now.)

2423
01:25:43,959 --> 01:25:45,504
I gave this some thought.

2424
01:25:46,730 --> 01:25:48,744
(Crying)

2425
01:25:49,829 --> 01:25:51,269
I gave this some thought.

2426
01:25:51,270 --> 01:25:52,345
(Laughing)

2427
01:25:52,770 --> 01:25:54,668
(Bursting into laughter)

2428
01:25:54,669 --> 01:25:56,284
- You are... - So Min, you're out.

2429
01:25:56,839 --> 01:25:58,279
(Feeling proud for some reason)

2430
01:25:58,280 --> 01:25:59,914
Did you discuss your ideas?

2431
01:26:00,079 --> 01:26:01,378
(Avoiding eye contact)

2432
01:26:01,379 --> 01:26:03,954
- We're still discussing them. - Go. You need to leave.

2433
01:26:04,450 --> 01:26:06,225
- Yes, I'm leaving. - Okay.

2434
01:26:06,249 --> 01:26:09,189
This is so funny. His centaur costume is so funny.

2435
01:26:09,190 --> 01:26:10,989
This is hilarious.

2436
01:26:10,990 --> 01:26:12,359
(Things are wrapping up as So Min leaves.)

2437
01:26:12,360 --> 01:26:13,628
All right. Let's hear it.

2438
01:26:13,629 --> 01:26:15,659
(Laughing)

2439
01:26:15,660 --> 01:26:16,958
(It makes him laugh rather late.)

2440
01:26:16,959 --> 01:26:18,458
Hey, don't look at me.

2441
01:26:18,459 --> 01:26:19,758
(Hey, don't look at me.)

2442
01:26:19,759 --> 01:26:21,869
(The moment your eyes meet with his, you'll face the penalty.)

2443
01:26:21,870 --> 01:26:23,338
Don't look at me.

2444
01:26:23,339 --> 01:26:25,239
(Holding his laughter)

2445
01:26:25,240 --> 01:26:27,284
This is so annoying.

2446
01:26:27,610 --> 01:26:29,708
Gosh. You look so funny.

2447
01:26:29,709 --> 01:26:32,708
I'm sorry. Can you turn around for a bit? Yes.

2448
01:26:32,709 --> 01:26:33,784
(I'm sorry. Can you turn around for a second?)

2449
01:26:34,280 --> 01:26:35,279
(What are you saying?)

2450
01:26:35,280 --> 01:26:38,654
That's funny. You want me to turn around?

2451
01:26:38,850 --> 01:26:40,095
- Yes. - So...

2452
01:26:41,289 --> 01:26:42,624
This is driving me crazy.

2453
01:26:42,749 --> 01:26:46,059
Okay. We should let his mistake slide as he's new.

2454
01:26:46,060 --> 01:26:47,088
(We should let his mistake slide as he's new.)

2455
01:26:47,089 --> 01:26:49,258
(Kwang Soo, don't say anything.)

2456
01:26:49,259 --> 01:26:51,628
Could you turn around?

2457
01:26:51,629 --> 01:26:53,699
- Hello. Excuse me for interrupting. - Hey.

2458
01:26:53,700 --> 01:26:55,369
(Excuse me for interrupting.)

2459
01:26:55,370 --> 01:26:56,869
I'll just change the light bulb.

2460
01:26:56,870 --> 01:26:58,239
- You need to change the light bulb? - Yes.

2461
01:26:58,240 --> 01:26:59,699
All of a sudden? We're in the middle of a meeting.

2462
01:26:59,700 --> 01:27:01,945
The light bulbs are fine. But you're going to change them?

2463
01:27:02,240 --> 01:27:03,809
(Jong Kook starts crying to avoid laughing.)

2464
01:27:03,810 --> 01:27:06,338
- We should watch him. - We ought to.

2465
01:27:06,339 --> 01:27:07,909
(The moment you watch it, you cannot stop laughing.)

2466
01:27:07,910 --> 01:27:10,578
(A strong aura of his skit tell them...)

2467
01:27:10,579 --> 01:27:12,819
(it will be impossible not to laugh at his skit.)

2468
01:27:12,820 --> 01:27:14,989
(The staff members are in a big crisis.)

2469
01:27:14,990 --> 01:27:18,294
(Will they be able to watch his skit without laughing?)

2470
01:27:18,690 --> 01:27:21,359
(A parade of funny skits you will want to watch)

2471
01:27:21,360 --> 01:27:24,059
(A fancy outing for the staff will be held.)

2472
01:27:24,060 --> 01:27:25,258
(An awful body roll)

2473
01:27:25,259 --> 01:27:26,258
(Phenomenal dance)

2474
01:27:26,259 --> 01:27:27,468
(Infinite cute acts)

2475
01:27:27,469 --> 01:27:29,328
(They were laughing without any worries.)

2476
01:27:29,329 --> 01:27:31,739
(A dangerous night at the TV station deepens.)

2477
01:27:31,740 --> 01:27:32,998
(Terrible water slaps)

2478
01:27:32,999 --> 01:27:34,985
(Deepening suspicions)

2479
01:27:35,469 --> 01:27:38,008
(The Coughing Ghost and Clacking Ghost are coming.)

2480
01:27:38,009 --> 01:27:41,008
(Put the legendary proposal in the safe without their knowing.)

2481
01:27:41,009 --> 01:27:43,378
(And there's one thing they cannot forget.)

2482
01:27:43,379 --> 01:27:46,119
(The Coughing Ghost and Clacking Ghost appear at midnight.)

2483
01:27:46,120 --> 01:27:48,989
(1st rule: Do not trust anyone.)

2484
01:27:48,990 --> 01:27:50,964
(2nd rule: Find the legendary proposal.)

2485
01:27:51,190 --> 01:27:53,458
(Those who are a step too late...)

2486
01:27:53,459 --> 01:27:55,689
(and those who are rushing.)

2487
01:27:55,690 --> 01:27:57,074
(You startled me.)

2488
01:27:57,429 --> 01:27:58,599
I'm sorry.

2489
01:27:58,600 --> 01:28:00,404
(Ghost Story of a TV Station: Legendary Proposal)
