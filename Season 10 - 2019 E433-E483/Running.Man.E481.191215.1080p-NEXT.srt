1
00:00:06,740 --> 00:00:09,940
(The biting wind makes the day
feel like a winter day.)

2
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:14,440
(Due to the sudden strong wind,
they can't do the opening outdoors.)

3
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:16,480
(They head indoors
to avoid the wind.)

4
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:18,010
- It's gotten very cold.
- Hello.

5
00:00:18,010 --> 00:00:19,150
Hello.

6
00:00:19,250 --> 00:00:20,510
- Is this a subway station?
- Hi.

7
00:00:20,510 --> 00:00:21,940
- The subway runs here?
- My gosh.

8
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:23,660
"Wolmi Sea Station".

9
00:00:23,820 --> 00:00:24,980
It must be a new subway station.

10
00:00:24,980 --> 00:00:27,190
- I guess we're going to get on it.
- Is this a real subway station?

11
00:00:27,190 --> 00:00:29,530
This isn't the subway.
This is the Wolmi Sea Train.

12
00:00:29,530 --> 00:00:30,820
- This is interesting.
- Sea Train?

13
00:00:30,820 --> 00:00:33,260
- Yes.
- What's the Sea Train? Gosh.

14
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:39,340
(You can get on a monorail that goes
around Wolmi Island and the sea.)

15
00:00:40,340 --> 00:00:41,840
This is a station.

16
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:43,030
There's good seafood here.

17
00:00:43,030 --> 00:00:44,340
I don't have any pockets.
Hold my phone for me.

18
00:00:44,340 --> 00:00:45,430
Sure.

19
00:00:45,430 --> 00:00:46,470
I have to hold his phone now.

20
00:00:46,470 --> 00:00:48,450
- Are you his secretary?
- He's using my pockets too.

21
00:00:48,450 --> 00:00:49,570
- Jong Kook.
- Yes?

22
00:00:49,570 --> 00:00:50,750
Kwang Soo has pockets too.
Why did you ask him?

23
00:00:50,750 --> 00:00:52,250
It's more comfortable to ask him.

24
00:00:52,250 --> 00:00:54,210
- Jong Kook, how could you say that?
- Is that so?

25
00:00:54,210 --> 00:00:55,520
- Don't be like that.
- What?

26
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:56,990
- He's uncomfortable with you now.
- Be nicer to him.

27
00:00:56,990 --> 00:00:59,820
My phone might mess up
your outfit.

28
00:00:59,820 --> 00:01:01,530
Your coat might droop down.

29
00:01:01,530 --> 00:01:03,700
Nonsense. If it's yours,
I'll even put it in my underwear.

30
00:01:03,700 --> 00:01:06,060
(Nonsense. If it's yours,
I'll even put it in my underwear.)

31
00:01:06,060 --> 00:01:07,860
- Jong Kook.
- Why would he say that?

32
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:09,930
You feel closer to Se Chan
than Kwang Soo, right?

33
00:01:09,930 --> 00:01:13,260
It's not that. It won't show
since he's wearing a mustang jacket.

34
00:01:13,260 --> 00:01:15,170
- Kwang Soo was his go-to guy.
- Right.

35
00:01:15,170 --> 00:01:17,480
- It's so disappointing. Se Chan...
- By the way,

36
00:01:17,480 --> 00:01:20,370
to tell you the truth, he and
Jong Kook grew apart after 2017.

37
00:01:20,370 --> 00:01:21,570
What?

38
00:01:21,570 --> 00:01:24,810
(His detailed recollection
is groundless.)

39
00:01:24,810 --> 00:01:26,650
- What? It's true.
- What happened two years ago?

40
00:01:26,650 --> 00:01:27,710
My gosh.

41
00:01:27,710 --> 00:01:29,010
- What happened two years ago?
- That's true.

42
00:01:29,290 --> 00:01:30,790
I could even guess the timeline.

43
00:01:30,790 --> 00:01:32,620
- That's not true.
- What?

44
00:01:32,620 --> 00:01:34,930
Kwang Soo, aren't you disappointed?
Put this in.

45
00:01:34,930 --> 00:01:36,090
What is this?

46
00:01:36,090 --> 00:01:37,230
(I'm already upset as it is.)

47
00:01:37,590 --> 00:01:39,350
(Throwing away his phone)

48
00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:41,090
(What have I done wrong?)

49
00:01:41,820 --> 00:01:43,200
What is he doing?

50
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:45,170
- He seemed disappointed.
- Great job.

51
00:01:45,700 --> 00:01:48,260
Seriously. Oh, right.
Let's congratulate Kwang Soo.

52
00:01:48,260 --> 00:01:50,430
- Why?
- He won an award.

53
00:01:50,430 --> 00:01:52,570
- He won the Popularity Award.
- Right. I knew that.

54
00:01:52,570 --> 00:01:54,540
- Popular Star Award.
- Popular Star Award.

55
00:01:54,810 --> 00:01:56,480
The Chungjungone's
Popular Star Award goes to...

56
00:01:56,480 --> 00:01:59,920
(He won the Popular Star Award
among countless actors.)

57
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:03,420
(Is this really happening?)

58
00:02:05,450 --> 00:02:07,430
(This is all thanks to you guys.)

59
00:02:07,790 --> 00:02:09,560
- It sounds like Chungjungone.
- "Chungjungone".

60
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:11,290
- "Chungjungone".
- Is it Chungjungone Award?

61
00:02:11,290 --> 00:02:12,560
- It's the Popular Star Award.
- No.

62
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:14,930
Did they create a new award
named Gochujang Award?

63
00:02:14,930 --> 00:02:16,370
- That's not the name.
- That's not it.

64
00:02:16,370 --> 00:02:17,370
- That's not it.
- Hey.

65
00:02:17,370 --> 00:02:19,430
- So it's from Chungjungone, right?
- Right.

66
00:02:19,430 --> 00:02:22,210
- Chungjungone and the film award...
- It's all...

67
00:02:22,210 --> 00:02:25,210
- It's the Popular Star Award!
- You should...

68
00:02:25,210 --> 00:02:27,550
(Exploding with annoyance)

69
00:02:27,710 --> 00:02:29,000
It's Chungjungone's
Popular Star Award.

70
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,780
So the company, Chungjungone,
gave you the award.

71
00:02:30,780 --> 00:02:32,680
- Did they give you gochujang?
- Right.

72
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:34,020
No, they didn't.

73
00:02:34,020 --> 00:02:35,780
- Or cooking oil?
- I got a trophy instead.

74
00:02:35,780 --> 00:02:38,310
- Congratulations on your award.
- Right.

75
00:02:38,310 --> 00:02:40,680
- Actually, when we were young,
- It's Blue Dragon Awards.

76
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:44,220
- it was the most respected awards.
- That's right. I'm proud of him.

77
00:02:44,220 --> 00:02:45,930
- Thank you.
- He won an award at a film awards.

78
00:02:45,930 --> 00:02:48,120
In "One-Eyed Jacks"...

79
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:49,370
- "One-Eyed Jacks".
- The scene with his back.

80
00:02:49,370 --> 00:02:50,690
- Right.
- He won the award with that scene.

81
00:02:50,690 --> 00:02:52,530
- I think that's why he won.
- His back.

82
00:02:52,530 --> 00:02:55,030
- That scene was very popular.
- A lot of people liked that scene.

83
00:02:55,030 --> 00:02:56,930
I won the award for my role
in "Inseparable Bros."

84
00:02:57,430 --> 00:02:59,110
- You should have asked me. You...
- Well...

85
00:02:59,110 --> 00:03:01,080
- Congratulations.
- Don't say it if you don't know.

86
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:02,840
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

87
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:04,150
- Award from Chungjungone.
- This is...

88
00:03:04,150 --> 00:03:05,870
- You won the award as a film actor.
- By the way,

89
00:03:05,870 --> 00:03:07,910
he was nominated
for the Supporting Actor too.

90
00:03:07,910 --> 00:03:09,250
- Right.
- Yes.

91
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:10,990
- That's impressive.
- He was nominated.

92
00:03:10,990 --> 00:03:13,530
Goodness. This is why I feel
uncomfortable around him.

93
00:03:14,330 --> 00:03:17,330
(This is why he feels uncomfortable
about Kwang Soo lately.)

94
00:03:17,330 --> 00:03:18,530
- That's not my fault.
- Jong Kook.

95
00:03:18,530 --> 00:03:20,400
- At the Blue Dragon Awards...
- I have your phone in my pocket.

96
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:21,430
- Okay.
- Yes.

97
00:03:21,430 --> 00:03:23,930
- At the Blue Dragon Awards...
- My gosh, stop it.

98
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:25,530
This is impressive.

99
00:03:25,530 --> 00:03:28,370
- What's happening?
- So Min is in a one-episode drama.

100
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:31,340
They sent you the coffee truck
to your location for the drama.

101
00:03:31,340 --> 00:03:34,150
Yes. I was very surprised.
I really had no idea.

102
00:03:34,150 --> 00:03:35,580
The truck showed up out of the blue.

103
00:03:35,580 --> 00:03:38,340
They sent the truck together
because if he sends it by himself,

104
00:03:38,340 --> 00:03:40,380
- we'll find out about his feelings.
- No.

105
00:03:40,380 --> 00:03:41,880
- He did it with Haha and Jong Kook.
- That's right.

106
00:03:41,880 --> 00:03:44,650
Se Chan got it all started.
His photo was in the middle.

107
00:03:44,650 --> 00:03:46,990
I saw that his photo
was all the way on top.

108
00:03:46,990 --> 00:03:49,090
- He chose that photo.
- They sent me the truck.

109
00:03:49,090 --> 00:03:51,720
He told me that he didn't do
much for the surprise.

110
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:53,120
He said that the other guys
came up with everything.

111
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:54,800
I really didn't know
they used my photo.

112
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:57,770
No. Se Chan insisted
on sending you the coffee truck.

113
00:03:58,130 --> 00:04:02,430
(What? Did you suggest the idea?)

114
00:04:02,810 --> 00:04:05,180
- You're acting all indifferent.
- Come on.

115
00:04:05,180 --> 00:04:06,750
- Seriously.
- You act cold on the outside.

116
00:04:06,750 --> 00:04:10,310
I was just standing here,
but I should've known better.

117
00:04:10,310 --> 00:04:11,340
(He was between them.)

118
00:04:11,340 --> 00:04:12,440
Come over here.

119
00:04:12,440 --> 00:04:14,020
- Stay here.
- By the way...

120
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:17,090
- Well, this is about Jae Suk.
- Yes?

121
00:04:17,460 --> 00:04:19,720
He's the number one celebrity
beloved by the people.

122
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:20,990
- My gosh.
- Gosh.

123
00:04:22,250 --> 00:04:23,730
- You know what?
- This is...

124
00:04:23,730 --> 00:04:25,800
Winning an award at the Blue Dragon
Awards is impressive,

125
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:27,370
but this is really impressive.

126
00:04:27,370 --> 00:04:29,430
- And we're doing a show with him.
- He's always ranked number one.

127
00:04:29,430 --> 00:04:31,330
We didn't know how famous he was
because we work with him.

128
00:04:31,330 --> 00:04:32,740
Even I was really surprised.

129
00:04:32,740 --> 00:04:34,370
- Thank you again.
- Suzy was in fifth place.

130
00:04:34,370 --> 00:04:37,330
- BTS was in sixth place.
- BTS.

131
00:04:37,830 --> 00:04:39,480
What's Suk Jin's ranking?

132
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,640
- He's not in the rankings?
- Hey, let's talk about good things.

133
00:04:42,640 --> 00:04:44,810
(Hey, let's talk about good things.)

134
00:04:44,810 --> 00:04:46,070
- Just in case.
- Congratulating him...

135
00:04:46,070 --> 00:04:48,010
- was hard for Suk Jin.
- I thought he might be ranked too.

136
00:04:48,180 --> 00:04:50,950
He was the only one who clapped
for Jae Suk while feeling bitter.

137
00:04:52,420 --> 00:04:54,750
Ji Hyo, any news from the past week?

138
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:56,320
(Well...)

139
00:04:56,430 --> 00:04:57,860
Well...

140
00:04:57,930 --> 00:04:59,430
- The drama?
- No.

141
00:04:59,430 --> 00:05:00,930
- What did you do?
- I stayed at home.

142
00:05:00,930 --> 00:05:02,000
(I stayed at home.)

143
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,470
- She stayed at home.
- You should go out, Ji Hyo.

144
00:05:04,470 --> 00:05:05,630
She's been staying home
for 10 years.

145
00:05:05,630 --> 00:05:07,630
You should walk around.
You always stay at home.

146
00:05:07,630 --> 00:05:10,740
You should come to my restaurant
and grill some meat...

147
00:05:10,740 --> 00:05:12,270
or babysit my children.

148
00:05:12,870 --> 00:05:14,550
I should call you.
You need a change of scenery.

149
00:05:14,550 --> 00:05:15,550
Ji Hyo...

150
00:05:15,550 --> 00:05:19,720
Before we start today's race,
some guests came to our show.

151
00:05:20,140 --> 00:05:21,420
We have guests.

152
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:24,220
(The door of the train
suddenly opens.)

153
00:05:24,290 --> 00:05:25,420
Ha Neul?

154
00:05:26,430 --> 00:05:27,430
What's this?

155
00:05:28,060 --> 00:05:29,180
What's this?

156
00:05:29,430 --> 00:05:30,950
- Gosh.
- Goodness!

157
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:33,020
- Gosh.
- Goodness!

158
00:05:33,020 --> 00:05:34,560
- My gosh.
- It's AOA.

159
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:39,100
It's AOA. Goodness!

160
00:05:39,630 --> 00:05:41,170
(Today's guest is AOA.)

161
00:05:41,170 --> 00:05:42,170
It's "Heart Attack."

162
00:05:42,170 --> 00:05:44,070
- AOA!
- The whole group is here.

163
00:05:45,410 --> 00:05:46,940
Gosh, you guys are here.

164
00:05:46,940 --> 00:05:48,440
It's AOA.

165
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:49,750
We missed you!

166
00:05:50,550 --> 00:05:52,720
It's nice to see you.

167
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:54,510
- They are dancing in the morning.
- She's going to copy them.

168
00:05:54,510 --> 00:05:55,640
- It's only 10:30 a.m. now.
- It's morning now.

169
00:05:55,640 --> 00:05:56,680
It's 10:30 a.m.

170
00:05:56,680 --> 00:05:58,360
(AOA performs their new song,
"Come See Me.")

171
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:01,320
My gosh, that's so cool.

172
00:06:02,250 --> 00:06:04,320
- I want to dance like them.
- My gosh.

173
00:06:04,390 --> 00:06:05,730
I want to dance like them too.

174
00:06:05,860 --> 00:06:07,020
They told us to come see them.

175
00:06:07,020 --> 00:06:08,100
(I'll go see you.)

176
00:06:13,970 --> 00:06:15,740
- Nice!
- That's nice.

177
00:06:16,110 --> 00:06:17,330
(Exclaiming)

178
00:06:18,070 --> 00:06:19,980
(Their intense performance
continues.)

179
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:24,220
(What is this white thing?)

180
00:06:26,070 --> 00:06:29,790
(AOA's refreshing performance
makes them want to go see them.)

181
00:06:29,790 --> 00:06:31,290
<i>- Come see me
- See me</i>

182
00:06:31,420 --> 00:06:33,380
<i>- Come see me
- Come see me</i>

183
00:06:33,380 --> 00:06:36,450
(All of a sudden,
it turns into a village festival.)

184
00:06:37,320 --> 00:06:40,230
(Please listen
to "Come See Me" a lot.)

185
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:42,970
AOA!

186
00:06:42,970 --> 00:06:44,600
(They give them a warm welcome
for their performance.)

187
00:06:46,260 --> 00:06:47,330
(The whole group has joined!)

188
00:06:47,330 --> 00:06:49,370
We've never had the whole group
on our show.

189
00:06:49,370 --> 00:06:50,630
The whole group is here.

190
00:06:50,740 --> 00:06:52,180
- In 2, 3. Hello.
- Hello.

191
00:06:52,180 --> 00:06:54,550
- We're ace of angels, AOA.
- We're ace of angels, AOA.

192
00:06:55,870 --> 00:06:58,250
(Especially welcoming
them zealously)

193
00:06:59,180 --> 00:07:00,920
- Great.
- Hyejeong.

194
00:07:01,380 --> 00:07:02,940
- Is that a hot pack on your belly?
- Yes.

195
00:07:03,510 --> 00:07:04,950
- I wanted to do my best today.
- She dressed warmly.

196
00:07:04,990 --> 00:07:06,580
- You know what I think?
- That's what I put it on.

197
00:07:06,790 --> 00:07:08,880
I don't think she would've done that
when she debuted.

198
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:11,950
But AOA is laid-back now.

199
00:07:11,950 --> 00:07:13,600
Your attitude changed a lot.

200
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:15,260
By the way,
during their performance,

201
00:07:15,390 --> 00:07:18,430
- we cheered them on.
- They were good.

202
00:07:18,430 --> 00:07:19,670
- And our cheers were outdated.
- They were outdated.

203
00:07:19,740 --> 00:07:21,740
The one that stood out
the most for me was...

204
00:07:21,810 --> 00:07:23,130
"Let's do it" stood out too.

205
00:07:23,130 --> 00:07:24,980
There was an unintelligible cheer.

206
00:07:26,330 --> 00:07:27,410
That's ancient.

207
00:07:27,410 --> 00:07:29,370
Majors in the army would say
something like that.

208
00:07:30,770 --> 00:07:32,180
- Or the commanders.
- Right.

209
00:07:32,770 --> 00:07:33,940
Great.

210
00:07:34,420 --> 00:07:37,180
Today, you'll taste signature
regional dishes in Incheon.

211
00:07:37,180 --> 00:07:39,250
It's Tasty Road in Incheon.
It's called Ace of Ace Race.

212
00:07:39,250 --> 00:07:41,790
(Tasty Road in Incheon:
Ace of Ace Race)

213
00:07:42,820 --> 00:07:44,020
Tasty food!

214
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:45,600
(Feeling happy)

215
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:47,060
There will be three rounds.

216
00:07:47,060 --> 00:07:49,830
You'll split into 3 teams of 4, 4,
and 5 and compete.

217
00:07:49,830 --> 00:07:53,870
Meal tickets will be disturbed
based on the result of the match.

218
00:07:53,870 --> 00:07:57,870
Each dish costs a certain number
of meal tickets to eat it.

219
00:07:57,870 --> 00:08:01,310
You will be given a meal ticket
you can use in your first mission.

220
00:08:01,310 --> 00:08:04,010
A team with 4 members will get 4.
And a team with 5 members, 5.

221
00:08:04,140 --> 00:08:05,770
However, the members
who fail to eat...

222
00:08:05,770 --> 00:08:08,220
- will get a penalty badge.
- There's a penalty again?

223
00:08:08,220 --> 00:08:10,950
The member with the most badges and
the member of his or her choice...

224
00:08:10,950 --> 00:08:13,060
- will face the penalty.
- The member will choose someone.

225
00:08:13,060 --> 00:08:14,380
- The member will choose someone.
- Again?

226
00:08:14,380 --> 00:08:16,560
- I'm doomed.
- My gosh, it's that again.

227
00:08:16,660 --> 00:08:18,660
A team with five members
may have an advantage,

228
00:08:18,660 --> 00:08:20,820
but if the team doesn't win,
it might be disadvantageous.

229
00:08:20,930 --> 00:08:23,800
Before you start your missions,
you'll split into teams first.

230
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:25,100
This is important. Yes.

231
00:08:25,100 --> 00:08:26,470
Here's how you'll form your teams.

232
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:28,910
You will come up with an order
and take turns to pick someone.

233
00:08:28,910 --> 00:08:32,000
When you say his or her lookalike,
anyone who laughs will be out.

234
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,410
(Anyone who laughs at the lookalike
will be out.)

235
00:08:33,410 --> 00:08:35,270
The last member to survive
will win the game.

236
00:08:35,270 --> 00:08:36,980
- This is hard.
- The winner will have the chance...

237
00:08:36,980 --> 00:08:38,640
to form all of the three teams
however he or she likes.

238
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:41,090
- The winner decides everything?
- The winner decides the teams.

239
00:08:41,910 --> 00:08:43,410
- Don't take it personally.
- Don't take it personally.

240
00:08:43,410 --> 00:08:45,690
- No holding grudges.
- We're supposed to make this funny.

241
00:08:46,150 --> 00:08:48,020
- We'll go this way.
- Sure.

242
00:08:48,830 --> 00:08:51,290
Ready, set, go.

243
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,120
Noh Joo Hyun.

244
00:08:53,870 --> 00:08:56,120
(Copy and paste)

245
00:08:56,120 --> 00:08:58,070
- That doesn't matter.
- The member on the left starts?

246
00:08:58,070 --> 00:09:00,070
- You can pick anyone.
- That doesn't matter.

247
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,070
Jong Kook, it's your turn.

248
00:09:02,070 --> 00:09:03,240
My neighbor.

249
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:04,370
(Pointing at Suk Jin)

250
00:09:04,610 --> 00:09:06,370
(He faces a small crisis...)

251
00:09:06,370 --> 00:09:08,370
(as Jong Kook comes up
with a believable lookalike.)

252
00:09:08,370 --> 00:09:09,480
Kwang Soo.

253
00:09:10,270 --> 00:09:11,410
Hippo's poop.

254
00:09:11,410 --> 00:09:13,490
(Kwang Soo said
Se Chan resembles hippo's poop.)

255
00:09:14,750 --> 00:09:18,360
(He hasn't seen it, but strangely,
it might resemble Se Chan.)

256
00:09:18,820 --> 00:09:21,960
(Imagining a hippo, pooping out
Se Chan in Savannah)

257
00:09:23,020 --> 00:09:24,020
Next.

258
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:25,150
Jimin.

259
00:09:25,620 --> 00:09:26,700
Jang Dong Gun.

260
00:09:26,700 --> 00:09:27,790
(Jimin says Suk Jin
resembles Jang Dong Gun.)

261
00:09:28,260 --> 00:09:30,130
(He can't believe his ears.)

262
00:09:30,570 --> 00:09:32,530
(They do share
the same nationality.)

263
00:09:32,840 --> 00:09:34,000
Jang Dong Gun.

264
00:09:34,610 --> 00:09:35,740
(Laughing)

265
00:09:35,740 --> 00:09:36,840
That was funny.

266
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:38,800
- Ji Hyo, you can't lower your head.
- I almost laughed.

267
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:40,770
- You're out.
- She laughed.

268
00:09:41,770 --> 00:09:43,980
- Ji Hyo, you're out.
- I'm out?

269
00:09:43,980 --> 00:09:45,580
- Go.
- You can't lower your head.

270
00:09:46,690 --> 00:09:47,780
Seolhyun.

271
00:09:48,280 --> 00:09:49,410
Rat.

272
00:09:51,380 --> 00:09:53,750
(Summoning a rodent
all of a sudden...)

273
00:09:53,750 --> 00:09:56,700
(makes him burst into laughter.)

274
00:09:56,750 --> 00:09:57,890
- You're out.
- You're out.

275
00:09:58,250 --> 00:09:59,830
(I almost laughed.)

276
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:01,620
She didn't say much,

277
00:10:01,620 --> 00:10:03,120
- but isn't "rat" so funny.
- I almost laughed.

278
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:05,470
My gosh. I shouldn't have laughed.

279
00:10:05,470 --> 00:10:06,840
(Rat: rodent, resembles Se Chan)

280
00:10:07,370 --> 00:10:08,570
Suk Jin.

281
00:10:08,740 --> 00:10:09,840
Chanmi.

282
00:10:10,130 --> 00:10:11,340
Yoo Ah In.

283
00:10:11,340 --> 00:10:12,530
(Suk Jin says Chanmi
resembles Yoo Ah In.)

284
00:10:13,610 --> 00:10:15,500
- I think she's mad.
- Yoo Ah In.

285
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:17,620
Kwang Soo.

286
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:20,250
- Are you crying?
- A long piece of poop.

287
00:10:20,250 --> 00:10:21,990
(Haha says Kwang Soo
resembles a long piece of poop.)

288
00:10:22,850 --> 00:10:25,050
(Kwang Soo is tall, but...)

289
00:10:25,050 --> 00:10:27,550
(This long piece of poop won
the Popular Star Award.)

290
00:10:27,550 --> 00:10:28,860
- A long piece of poop.
- A long piece of poop.

291
00:10:29,250 --> 00:10:32,460
(The laughter alert is issued.)

292
00:10:32,890 --> 00:10:34,000
A long piece of poop.

293
00:10:34,760 --> 00:10:35,970
- Dragon poop.
- You're out.

294
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:39,470
(Some of them are eliminated
at his answer.)

295
00:10:39,470 --> 00:10:40,760
- Seolhyun. Yuna. You're out.
- Why did you laugh?

296
00:10:40,940 --> 00:10:42,070
Seolhyun, you're out.

297
00:10:42,870 --> 00:10:44,740
- Why are you laughing?
- That was...

298
00:10:47,140 --> 00:10:48,770
That was a ridiculous answer.
Why did you laugh?

299
00:10:50,850 --> 00:10:52,820
Why was it a long piece? Why?

300
00:10:53,080 --> 00:10:54,510
That answer eliminated
almost everyone.

301
00:10:54,850 --> 00:10:56,620
- It was so funny.
- Nice try.

302
00:10:56,780 --> 00:11:00,360
It was so funny. Even the color
of his coat reminds me of poop.

303
00:11:00,490 --> 00:11:02,330
- Next up is Se Chan.
- Jimin.

304
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:04,150
Colonel Fury.

305
00:11:04,150 --> 00:11:06,920
(Se Chan says
Jimin resembles Colonel Fury.)

306
00:11:07,470 --> 00:11:09,660
(The level of resemblance
is very high.)

307
00:11:10,130 --> 00:11:11,740
(Laughing)

308
00:11:13,870 --> 00:11:15,070
Colonel Fury.

309
00:11:15,870 --> 00:11:17,130
- Colonel Fury.
- That was so mean.

310
00:11:17,130 --> 00:11:18,800
- I wasn't going to say that.
- He's no joke.

311
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:20,540
- That was so mean.
- Why?

312
00:11:20,540 --> 00:11:21,950
- No, this is just a game.
- My gosh.

313
00:11:23,480 --> 00:11:25,410
- This is just a game.
- Next.

314
00:11:25,870 --> 00:11:27,540
- Kwang Soo.
- Se Chan.

315
00:11:29,350 --> 00:11:30,550
Punched clay.

316
00:11:30,550 --> 00:11:31,910
(Kwang Soo says Se Chan
resembles punched clay.)

317
00:11:32,490 --> 00:11:33,690
Punched clay.

318
00:11:33,690 --> 00:11:35,050
(Slamming)

319
00:11:35,230 --> 00:11:37,860
(How to make Se Chan,
eyes, nose, mouth)

320
00:11:39,150 --> 00:11:41,230
That was a nice answer.
"Punched clay."

321
00:11:41,660 --> 00:11:43,020
- That was hurtful.
- It's all right.

322
00:11:43,260 --> 00:11:44,870
- That was hurtful.
- This is just a game.

323
00:11:44,890 --> 00:11:45,970
This is just a game.

324
00:11:46,900 --> 00:11:48,240
I'm glad I got eliminated early on.

325
00:11:49,370 --> 00:11:50,740
- Jimin.
- Kwang Soo.

326
00:11:51,400 --> 00:11:52,580
Tumbling leaf.

327
00:11:52,580 --> 00:11:54,480
(Jimin says
Kwang Soo is a tumbling leaf.)

328
00:11:54,670 --> 00:11:56,640
- Jimin.
- Kwang Soo.

329
00:11:56,910 --> 00:11:58,040
A tumbling leaf.

330
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:01,450
(How does a tumbling leaf look?)

331
00:12:01,820 --> 00:12:03,010
I think he smiled.

332
00:12:05,150 --> 00:12:07,780
(Strangely, we might have seen him
tumble on the ground.)

333
00:12:07,780 --> 00:12:09,330
- That was funny.
- Next.

334
00:12:09,330 --> 00:12:11,150
- "Tumbling leaf".
- They are all inanimate.

335
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:12,520
All right. That was hilarious.

336
00:12:12,790 --> 00:12:14,020
Next up is Hyejeong.

337
00:12:14,290 --> 00:12:15,600
Suk Jin.

338
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:16,620
Grandpa.

339
00:12:16,620 --> 00:12:17,870
(Hyejeong says
Suk Jin resembles a grandpa.)

340
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:20,030
Suk Jin. Grandpa.

341
00:12:20,030 --> 00:12:22,240
(Grandpa)

342
00:12:22,740 --> 00:12:25,400
(Se Chan and Jong Kook laugh
at her brutally honest answer.)

343
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,250
That was brutally honest.

344
00:12:27,950 --> 00:12:29,540
- That was brutally honest.
- Hey.

345
00:12:29,540 --> 00:12:31,270
(Being with youth hurts.)

346
00:12:31,270 --> 00:12:33,010
- You're all out.
- That was hilarious.

347
00:12:33,080 --> 00:12:34,140
Next up is Jimin.

348
00:12:34,140 --> 00:12:36,320
(It's Jimin's turn again.)

349
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:37,880
Kwang Soo.

350
00:12:37,880 --> 00:12:39,380
(She goes after Kwang Soo again.)

351
00:12:40,380 --> 00:12:42,280
- An envelope.
- "Envelope".

352
00:12:43,830 --> 00:12:44,960
Envelope.

353
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:47,520
(This is long too.)

354
00:12:47,520 --> 00:12:48,870
Hyejeong is out.

355
00:12:49,660 --> 00:12:54,000
(The remaining members are out
as she continues to name objects.)

356
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,260
- It's impossible not to laugh.
- Hyejeong is out.

357
00:12:55,260 --> 00:12:57,740
- Jimin wins.
- What was that? Envelope?

358
00:12:57,740 --> 00:12:59,270
- Envelope.
- But he does look like an envelope.

359
00:12:59,270 --> 00:13:00,670
- That was funny.
- But he looks like it.

360
00:13:00,670 --> 00:13:02,210
- Right.
- Envelope.

361
00:13:02,210 --> 00:13:03,640
I can't believe she said envelope.

362
00:13:03,640 --> 00:13:04,870
That was a funny answer.

363
00:13:04,870 --> 00:13:05,950
- Poop envelope.
- Right.

364
00:13:06,010 --> 00:13:08,140
- I know. The yellow one, right?
- The long one.

365
00:13:08,140 --> 00:13:09,350
Right.

366
00:13:09,350 --> 00:13:11,880
(He only got hurt
by trying to stay to the end.)

367
00:13:11,880 --> 00:13:13,880
Jimin, you can divide them
into three teams.

368
00:13:13,880 --> 00:13:16,420
- Teams of 4, 4, and 5.
- Teams of 4, 4, and 5?

369
00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:18,360
I'll go with the Envelope Guy.

370
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:20,370
Okay.

371
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:24,000
- Haha.
- Great!

372
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,840
(Jimin picks Kwang Soo and Haha.)

373
00:13:25,840 --> 00:13:27,070
And So Min.

374
00:13:27,470 --> 00:13:28,530
This is the best team.

375
00:13:28,970 --> 00:13:30,710
You chose only the sly members.

376
00:13:30,710 --> 00:13:32,210
(Colonel Jimin formed
the Avengers with sly members.)

377
00:13:32,300 --> 00:13:34,080
- She only chose the good ones.
- My gosh.

378
00:13:35,370 --> 00:13:36,950
- Suk Jin.
- Okay.

379
00:13:36,950 --> 00:13:37,950
(Jimin can choose
teams for others.)

380
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:40,510
- Suk Jin.
- Okay.

381
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:42,450
(Don't look at her eyes.)

382
00:13:44,280 --> 00:13:46,550
(Instinctively avoiding her eyes)

383
00:13:46,990 --> 00:13:50,550
(As Suk Jin's name is called,
they all look away.)

384
00:13:50,550 --> 00:13:51,830
No one is looking at her.

385
00:13:51,830 --> 00:13:53,390
- Hey.
- No one is looking at her.

386
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:56,070
(Everyone felt a sense of danger.)

387
00:13:56,290 --> 00:13:57,500
- Hey.
- No one is looking at her.

388
00:13:57,500 --> 00:13:58,890
- Everyone stopped breathing.
- You're looking at the floor.

389
00:13:58,890 --> 00:14:00,630
- Why did you pick me first?
- Right now...

390
00:14:00,630 --> 00:14:01,900
I couldn't breathe.

391
00:14:01,900 --> 00:14:03,710
- For the first time today,
- I thought we were playing...

392
00:14:03,710 --> 00:14:05,300
- I looked at the floor.
- a game of silence.

393
00:14:05,300 --> 00:14:07,580
- It was a game of silence.
- I looked at the floor.

394
00:14:08,350 --> 00:14:10,620
- Pick him at the end.
- At the end?

395
00:14:10,620 --> 00:14:13,040
- Okay.
- I'll pick your team last.

396
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:14,820
- You need to separate them well.
- Okay.

397
00:14:14,820 --> 00:14:16,320
(Teams)

398
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:17,510
- Come on.
- Nice.

399
00:14:17,510 --> 00:14:18,910
Wait and see.

400
00:14:19,590 --> 00:14:21,330
- It's gotten cold suddenly.
- Yes.

401
00:14:21,330 --> 00:14:22,550
(Heading to the first mission
after forming their teams)

402
00:14:22,650 --> 00:14:23,750
- Se Chan.
- Yes.

403
00:14:23,750 --> 00:14:25,360
You could have taken my seat.

404
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:27,230
Why did you wait for me
and sit there instead?

405
00:14:27,370 --> 00:14:28,370
- Me?
- Yes.

406
00:14:28,370 --> 00:14:29,890
- Is she making you self-conscious?
- Who is?

407
00:14:32,740 --> 00:14:34,840
- Is she making you self-conscious?
- Who is?

408
00:14:35,610 --> 00:14:37,270
(Peekaboo)

409
00:14:37,270 --> 00:14:39,170
(It's So Min.)

410
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:40,640
- That was awkward.
- So Min is there.

411
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:42,750
Keep a distance for the time being.

412
00:14:42,750 --> 00:14:44,120
- Yes. I will.
- Last week,

413
00:14:44,120 --> 00:14:46,120
I called Se Chan a few times.

414
00:14:46,370 --> 00:14:48,640
But he tried to hang up
the phone quickly.

415
00:14:48,640 --> 00:14:49,850
- Why do you feel awkward?
- No.

416
00:14:49,850 --> 00:14:51,860
Se Chan might be confused
because we keep...

417
00:14:52,280 --> 00:14:53,960
- mentioning this on TV.
- You're keeping your distance.

418
00:14:55,150 --> 00:14:56,460
Is she his love interest?

419
00:14:56,460 --> 00:14:58,020
- Yes.
- Who said that?

420
00:14:58,230 --> 00:15:00,730
(Are they
each other's love interest?)

421
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,200
- That's not true, Hyejeong.
- Yes.

422
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:03,200
- That's right.
- No.

423
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:04,440
- Not yet.
- Is it just a fling?

424
00:15:04,440 --> 00:15:05,570
It didn't happen yet.

425
00:15:05,570 --> 00:15:06,630
- Is it a fling?
- There's something between them.

426
00:15:06,630 --> 00:15:07,660
Hey.

427
00:15:08,030 --> 00:15:10,670
When your mind is made up,
call me in front of my house.

428
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:15,850
(So Min's blunt comment toward him)

429
00:15:16,300 --> 00:15:18,080
- Did you hear that?
- Make your decision.

430
00:15:18,080 --> 00:15:19,410
So Min keeps leading him on.

431
00:15:19,410 --> 00:15:20,750
It'll happen tonight. "So Min."

432
00:15:22,350 --> 00:15:23,720
"Did you mean that earlier or not?"

433
00:15:23,780 --> 00:15:25,150
- Why are you doing this to me?
- What?

434
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:27,280
- Chanmi is the youngest, right?
- Yes.

435
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:29,330
- How old are you?
- I'm 24.

436
00:15:29,780 --> 00:15:31,520
- Really?
- You're so young!

437
00:15:31,520 --> 00:15:32,830
- What about you, Seolhyun?
- They are older.

438
00:15:32,830 --> 00:15:34,000
I'm 25.

439
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,120
- What?
- I see.

440
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:37,390
- You started from middle school.
- She's still young.

441
00:15:37,390 --> 00:15:40,130
I thought you were 21.

442
00:15:41,110 --> 00:15:42,870
- 21?
- So Min isn't happy.

443
00:15:42,870 --> 00:15:44,110
Why not?

444
00:15:44,110 --> 00:15:45,240
(Don't talk about other women.)

445
00:15:45,240 --> 00:15:46,900
- Look at her face.
- No, no.

446
00:15:46,900 --> 00:15:48,480
- Look at her.
- She hates it.

447
00:15:48,540 --> 00:15:52,540
- Not at all.
- So Min, how old are you?

448
00:15:52,540 --> 00:15:54,090
- How old are you?
- I'm 34.

449
00:15:56,140 --> 00:15:59,150
(I may be 34,
but I still want to be cute.)

450
00:15:59,150 --> 00:16:00,690
34? What was that?

451
00:16:01,050 --> 00:16:03,330
(As So Min became cuter and cuter,)

452
00:16:03,330 --> 00:16:05,620
(they finally arrive
at their first destination.)

453
00:16:06,100 --> 00:16:07,470
This is Chinatown.

454
00:16:07,470 --> 00:16:08,700
We had a great time last time.

455
00:16:08,700 --> 00:16:10,020
- The place became more beautiful.
- You're right.

456
00:16:10,020 --> 00:16:11,790
They decorated the place.

457
00:16:11,790 --> 00:16:13,940
For the first mission,

458
00:16:13,940 --> 00:16:17,480
you'll have jjajangmyeon, jjamppong,
and tangsuyuk.

459
00:16:17,480 --> 00:16:20,710
(It's a Chinese special.)

460
00:16:21,580 --> 00:16:23,140
- Chinese cuisine.
- Let's do this!

461
00:16:23,140 --> 00:16:26,410
Each of you will get
a meal ticket.

462
00:16:26,410 --> 00:16:28,950
Each dish will need
a specific number of meal tickets.

463
00:16:28,950 --> 00:16:30,550
Jjajangmyeon and jjamppong need
two tickets each.

464
00:16:30,550 --> 00:16:32,380
For 2 servings
of tangsuyuk, you need 5 tickets.

465
00:16:32,380 --> 00:16:33,410
Five?

466
00:16:33,410 --> 00:16:35,520
Those who cannot eat...

467
00:16:35,520 --> 00:16:37,730
will be given penalty badges.

468
00:16:38,050 --> 00:16:40,120
- But not if we eat?
- So we need to eat.

469
00:16:40,120 --> 00:16:41,230
(They need to eat in order
not to get one.)

470
00:16:41,230 --> 00:16:43,260
Let's start with jjajangmyeon.

471
00:16:43,260 --> 00:16:44,940
- I'm going to have this.
- Me too.

472
00:16:45,290 --> 00:16:46,940
Your first mission is called...

473
00:16:47,110 --> 00:16:49,240
Trick or True Yut.

474
00:16:49,240 --> 00:16:50,260
- What?
- Yut?

475
00:16:50,260 --> 00:16:51,480
(Trick or True Yut)

476
00:16:51,480 --> 00:16:53,170
The rules are simple.

477
00:16:53,170 --> 00:16:56,170
You'll move according to the result
of the thrown yut-sticks.

478
00:16:56,170 --> 00:16:58,640
The 1st to get 2 of their pieces
across the board wins.

479
00:16:58,870 --> 00:16:59,870
Okay!

480
00:16:59,870 --> 00:17:01,690
The winning team will be given
10 meal tickets.

481
00:17:01,690 --> 00:17:03,410
(1st place will be given
10 meal tickets.)

482
00:17:03,410 --> 00:17:04,990
The 2nd team will be given 5.

483
00:17:04,990 --> 00:17:07,380
The third team won't be given any.

484
00:17:07,550 --> 00:17:09,250
Five tickets aren't bad either.

485
00:17:09,250 --> 00:17:10,400
There are four of us.

486
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:11,520
Here's the catch.

487
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:13,050
You will play the game in order.

488
00:17:13,050 --> 00:17:15,590
The other two teams may not see
the result.

489
00:17:16,090 --> 00:17:17,670
The playing team will play
in secret.

490
00:17:17,670 --> 00:17:19,470
The actual result of the game
doesn't matter.

491
00:17:19,470 --> 00:17:22,260
You may move according
to the result or lie.

492
00:17:22,260 --> 00:17:23,470
We can lie?

493
00:17:23,470 --> 00:17:25,800
For example, you got a gae
but lie and say you got a yut.

494
00:17:25,800 --> 00:17:28,910
If the other two teams think
that you are lying,

495
00:17:28,910 --> 00:17:31,310
they can raise the red X card
in the given minute...

496
00:17:31,310 --> 00:17:33,540
and say, "Trick!"

497
00:17:33,680 --> 00:17:36,420
If it truly turns out to be a lie,

498
00:17:36,580 --> 00:17:38,750
their piece will be eliminated,

499
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:41,960
and the team that caught them
will replace it with theirs.

500
00:17:42,750 --> 00:17:44,660
If it turns out that the team
has told the truth,

501
00:17:44,660 --> 00:17:46,550
the other team will remove
one of their own pieces.

502
00:17:46,550 --> 00:17:48,090
If there are no pieces available,

503
00:17:48,090 --> 00:17:52,170
they'll have to give
one of their meal tickets.

504
00:17:52,170 --> 00:17:55,030
If you've run out of tickets
as well,

505
00:17:55,030 --> 00:17:58,180
I'll be handing you penalty badges.

506
00:17:58,180 --> 00:17:59,300
(The penalty badges will be given.)

507
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:01,710
We shouldn't say trick whenever
we want.

508
00:18:01,710 --> 00:18:03,180
- Right?
- We should discuss first.

509
00:18:03,180 --> 00:18:04,810
- You're right.
- Don't worry.

510
00:18:04,810 --> 00:18:06,270
- Don't worry.
- We're a team.

511
00:18:06,270 --> 00:18:10,010
Now, we will decide on the order.

512
00:18:10,110 --> 00:18:11,810
- Let's play the Race of Wits.
- That's good.

513
00:18:11,810 --> 00:18:13,280
Don't you know how many of us
are here today?

514
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:15,020
- There are 12.
- I see.

515
00:18:15,020 --> 00:18:16,630
- No, there are 13.
- I see.

516
00:18:16,630 --> 00:18:17,790
Let's begin.

517
00:18:17,900 --> 00:18:18,900
Start.

518
00:18:18,900 --> 00:18:19,900
- 1.
- 1.

519
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:22,630
- You're out.
- Se Chan.

520
00:18:22,630 --> 00:18:26,590
(As soon as the game begins,
So Min and Se Chan are eliminated.)

521
00:18:26,860 --> 00:18:28,600
What was that?

522
00:18:29,060 --> 00:18:30,500
- What was that?
- What was that?

523
00:18:30,530 --> 00:18:33,440
- What was that?
- What was that?

524
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:34,800
What was that?

525
00:18:34,800 --> 00:18:35,800
(Her heart is fluttering as well.)

526
00:18:36,100 --> 00:18:37,180
You're eliminated.

527
00:18:37,180 --> 00:18:38,650
- So Min, we're eliminated.
- You are.

528
00:18:38,650 --> 00:18:39,680
- Step back.
- You're out.

529
00:18:39,680 --> 00:18:40,840
Go.

530
00:18:40,840 --> 00:18:41,990
Start.

531
00:18:42,650 --> 00:18:43,690
One.

532
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:45,420
- Two.
- No.

533
00:18:45,890 --> 00:18:47,160
- 3.
- 4.

534
00:18:47,390 --> 00:18:48,390
- 5.
- 6.

535
00:18:48,390 --> 00:18:49,390
- 7.
- 7.

536
00:18:49,390 --> 00:18:52,200
(Their teamwork is amazing.)

537
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:53,400
- 6.
- 7.

538
00:18:54,560 --> 00:18:56,130
Good job.

539
00:18:56,130 --> 00:18:57,200
You're out.

540
00:18:57,200 --> 00:18:58,470
- It's okay.
- There are only three of us.

541
00:18:58,470 --> 00:18:59,940
- It's okay.
- You're out?

542
00:18:59,940 --> 00:19:01,170
Yes.

543
00:19:01,170 --> 00:19:02,300
- Start.
- Me too?

544
00:19:02,300 --> 00:19:03,830
- Not you.
- It shouldn't overlap.

545
00:19:03,830 --> 00:19:04,910
- You shouldn't.
- I got it.

546
00:19:04,910 --> 00:19:06,100
You're not out.

547
00:19:06,100 --> 00:19:07,300
- You're not out.
- Get in.

548
00:19:07,300 --> 00:19:09,450
- Seolhyun is out, right?
- She said seven.

549
00:19:09,450 --> 00:19:11,150
- Right?
- No.

550
00:19:11,150 --> 00:19:13,340
- We heard you loud and clear.
- No.

551
00:19:13,340 --> 00:19:15,010
- Hold on.
- She's not out.

552
00:19:15,010 --> 00:19:16,650
- Don't be ridiculous.
- I mean...

553
00:19:16,650 --> 00:19:18,720
- She said seven.
- Hold on.

554
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:20,750
- No, she's not out.
- Tell us.

555
00:19:20,750 --> 00:19:22,280
- Are you out?
- No.

556
00:19:22,280 --> 00:19:23,350
See?

557
00:19:23,350 --> 00:19:24,350
(She's so brazen.)

558
00:19:24,700 --> 00:19:25,900
See?

559
00:19:25,900 --> 00:19:26,900
- See?
- I'm not out.

560
00:19:26,900 --> 00:19:28,700
- She's not out?
- No.

561
00:19:28,700 --> 00:19:29,900
She's out.

562
00:19:29,900 --> 00:19:31,140
- Guys.
- Our other team member...

563
00:19:31,140 --> 00:19:32,240
- was out.
- Do you know...

564
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:33,700
Do you know what Chanmi said?

565
00:19:33,700 --> 00:19:34,760
- What?
- It was so shocking.

566
00:19:34,800 --> 00:19:36,500
"Seolhyun is a good liar."

567
00:19:36,500 --> 00:19:38,210
(Chanmi tattles on her.)

568
00:19:38,300 --> 00:19:40,000
(They're fair and square.)

569
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,270
See?

570
00:19:41,270 --> 00:19:43,410
- See?
- Seolhyun is a good liar.

571
00:19:43,410 --> 00:19:46,340
(She was a whistleblower.)

572
00:19:46,340 --> 00:19:47,780
Guys.

573
00:19:47,780 --> 00:19:48,990
Chanmi...

574
00:19:48,990 --> 00:19:50,580
has changed a lot.

575
00:19:51,080 --> 00:19:52,960
- She's a good liar.
- What is she doing?

576
00:19:53,220 --> 00:19:55,190
- She's so brazen.
- She really is.

577
00:19:55,190 --> 00:19:56,660
Seolhyun was doing well.

578
00:19:56,660 --> 00:19:58,020
I'm so dumbfounded.

579
00:19:58,520 --> 00:19:59,550
Chanmi.

580
00:19:59,550 --> 00:20:01,630
If you lose this round,
your team will be in third place.

581
00:20:01,630 --> 00:20:03,320
Jong Kook will say two.

582
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:04,560
Don't forget that.

583
00:20:04,560 --> 00:20:06,470
There's no doubt.

584
00:20:06,470 --> 00:20:07,800
- We can make a sacrifice.
- Jong Kook.

585
00:20:07,800 --> 00:20:10,240
One of us needs to say two as well.

586
00:20:11,270 --> 00:20:12,270
Start.

587
00:20:12,270 --> 00:20:13,440
- 1.
- 1.

588
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:17,840
(Chanmi, Kwang Soo,
and Jimin are out.)

589
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:19,150
(That's it.)

590
00:20:19,150 --> 00:20:20,510
I'm the winner.

591
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:22,190
We won!

592
00:20:22,250 --> 00:20:23,780
- I didn't say it.
- You did.

593
00:20:23,920 --> 00:20:25,580
No, I didn't.

594
00:20:25,580 --> 00:20:27,080
- Yes, you did.
- No, I...

595
00:20:27,490 --> 00:20:29,080
- I really didn't.
- Come on, Jimin.

596
00:20:29,080 --> 00:20:31,500
- Why have you become so brazen?
- I really didn't.

597
00:20:31,500 --> 00:20:33,130
- I didn't, though.
- You did.

598
00:20:33,130 --> 00:20:35,060
- Stop it.
- Jimin.

599
00:20:35,060 --> 00:20:36,700
Let's play fair and square.

600
00:20:36,700 --> 00:20:37,970
- I'm serious.
- Come on.

601
00:20:37,970 --> 00:20:39,640
This is not fair.

602
00:20:40,090 --> 00:20:42,000
Hold on. Chanmi said something
once again.

603
00:20:42,530 --> 00:20:44,140
- Chanmi told me something.
- What?

604
00:20:44,140 --> 00:20:48,600
- "Jimin is close with Seolhyun."
- Wait.

605
00:20:48,710 --> 00:20:51,680
- So don't lie.
- I didn't say a thing.

606
00:20:51,680 --> 00:20:52,810
- Hey.
- Come on.

607
00:20:52,810 --> 00:20:55,610
- Exactly. I was getting ready.
- She knows everything.

608
00:20:55,780 --> 00:20:57,660
Jong Kook's team will decide.

609
00:20:57,660 --> 00:20:59,490
All right. We get to pick.
What should we do?

610
00:21:00,350 --> 00:21:01,930
- Here you go.
- Thanks.

611
00:21:01,930 --> 00:21:04,000
- We shouldn't be greedy.
- You're right.

612
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:05,090
All right.

613
00:21:05,230 --> 00:21:06,820
- This is...
- It's only the beginning.

614
00:21:06,820 --> 00:21:08,290
- This is hard.
- Isn't it?

615
00:21:08,670 --> 00:21:09,860
- I'll go.
- Okay.

616
00:21:10,170 --> 00:21:11,530
Here she goes.

617
00:21:11,530 --> 00:21:14,410
(What is the outcome?)

618
00:21:14,410 --> 00:21:15,800
Okay, then.

619
00:21:16,830 --> 00:21:18,270
You need to move it.

620
00:21:19,180 --> 00:21:20,570
(She looks suspicious.)

621
00:21:20,570 --> 00:21:22,250
Don't I get another toss?

622
00:21:22,250 --> 00:21:24,070
(Is she telling the truth or not?)

623
00:21:24,070 --> 00:21:25,150
(Is this the truth?)

624
00:21:25,150 --> 00:21:27,040
We already heard
you're a good liar.

625
00:21:27,040 --> 00:21:28,990
- She's really good.
- It's a habit now.

626
00:21:28,990 --> 00:21:30,310
It really is.

627
00:21:30,340 --> 00:21:31,690
- A habit?
- It is.

628
00:21:31,690 --> 00:21:33,190
I bet this is a geol.

629
00:21:33,190 --> 00:21:34,730
- It is.
- It is.

630
00:21:34,730 --> 00:21:36,690
It's geol. One of the sticks
looked like this.

631
00:21:36,690 --> 00:21:38,550
I'm not good at lying.

632
00:21:38,550 --> 00:21:40,350
- Please turn around.
- I can't believe this.

633
00:21:40,350 --> 00:21:42,060
- What is it?
- We get another shot anyway.

634
00:21:42,060 --> 00:21:43,700
- What did you get?
- We caught yours.

635
00:21:43,700 --> 00:21:44,970
- You did?
- Yes.

636
00:21:44,970 --> 00:21:47,030
- Whose?
- Ours.

637
00:21:47,030 --> 00:21:50,600
(Will they doubt him?)

638
00:21:50,600 --> 00:21:52,000
Jong Kook's not the type...

639
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,570
- to risk from the beginning.
- This is for sure.

640
00:21:53,570 --> 00:21:54,600
Of course.

641
00:21:54,600 --> 00:21:57,100
But since Seolhyun's
on the team, it could be a lie.

642
00:21:57,100 --> 00:22:00,310
- Not at all.
- I heard she's a good liar.

643
00:22:00,310 --> 00:22:02,040
Gae comes out the most often.

644
00:22:02,040 --> 00:22:03,490
Right. Either gae or geol.

645
00:22:03,490 --> 00:22:04,810
- Shall we pass?
- Sure.

646
00:22:04,810 --> 00:22:06,080
- Let's do that.
- We give this a pass.

647
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:07,080
Let's give it a pass.

648
00:22:07,080 --> 00:22:08,550
- A pass?
- Let's suspect them.

649
00:22:08,550 --> 00:22:10,190
Let's try that.

650
00:22:10,190 --> 00:22:11,350
- Just this once.
- Just this once.

651
00:22:11,350 --> 00:22:12,430
- Let's do this.
- Okay.

652
00:22:12,430 --> 00:22:13,500
- Let's go.
- Just this once.

653
00:22:13,500 --> 00:22:14,900
- 1, 2, 3. Trick.
- Trick.

654
00:22:14,900 --> 00:22:16,090
(They trust Kwang Soo.)

655
00:22:16,090 --> 00:22:17,970
Were they telling the truth?

656
00:22:17,970 --> 00:22:22,740
(Did Team Green really get a gae,
or are they lying?)

657
00:22:23,060 --> 00:22:24,910
- Yes. Give us a meal ticket.
- See?

658
00:22:24,910 --> 00:22:26,710
- I was right.
- Right.

659
00:22:27,410 --> 00:22:28,450
(Seolhyun did get a gae.)

660
00:22:28,450 --> 00:22:30,270
- That was amazing.
- Gae is easy to get.

661
00:22:30,270 --> 00:22:31,720
- You see...
- Gae and geol come out the most.

662
00:22:31,720 --> 00:22:33,480
- Right.
- You're right.

663
00:22:33,540 --> 00:22:35,490
One of you should hand over
a ticket.

664
00:22:35,490 --> 00:22:37,490
You two can pick.

665
00:22:37,490 --> 00:22:39,420
1, 2, 3. You.

666
00:22:39,420 --> 00:22:40,820
(They choose Kwang Soo.)

667
00:22:41,550 --> 00:22:43,520
- You instigated it.
- You did.

668
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:44,590
- Right.
- Exactly.

669
00:22:44,590 --> 00:22:45,750
- I told you it was right.
- You know what?

670
00:22:45,750 --> 00:22:47,700
You guys look like amateurs.

671
00:22:47,700 --> 00:22:49,290
- An amateur?
- An amateur?

672
00:22:49,290 --> 00:22:50,470
They do.

673
00:22:50,670 --> 00:22:52,260
Turn around.

674
00:22:52,330 --> 00:22:53,790
We're going to throw it.

675
00:22:53,790 --> 00:22:55,500
(He's at a loss for words.)

676
00:22:56,910 --> 00:22:59,210
Didn't it feel like a lie, though?

677
00:23:00,570 --> 00:23:01,710
Did you throw it yet?

678
00:23:01,710 --> 00:23:03,250
- Yes.
- Chanmi, you can throw it.

679
00:23:03,250 --> 00:23:04,540
- Go first.
- Go.

680
00:23:04,540 --> 00:23:06,220
- I haven't done this before.
- So...

681
00:23:06,220 --> 00:23:08,650
- There's beginner's luck.
- You can do it.

682
00:23:08,650 --> 00:23:09,650
- Right.
- All right.

683
00:23:10,220 --> 00:23:11,460
I'm fine with either gae or geol.

684
00:23:11,460 --> 00:23:12,660
- Both of them are fine.
- I tried this when I was little.

685
00:23:12,660 --> 00:23:14,430
I can determine by the sound.

686
00:23:14,730 --> 00:23:15,780
Don't look.

687
00:23:15,780 --> 00:23:17,230
If it's a good toss, let's shout.

688
00:23:17,230 --> 00:23:18,430
- Shout?
- Yes.

689
00:23:18,430 --> 00:23:19,930
Yes, let's do that.

690
00:23:19,930 --> 00:23:21,060
Here we go.

691
00:23:21,060 --> 00:23:22,790
Whatever we get will be nice.

692
00:23:22,790 --> 00:23:23,820
Good luck!

693
00:23:23,820 --> 00:23:25,200
(After discussing how to react,
she throws the sticks.)

694
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:27,970
(Will Chanmi experience
beginner's luck?)

695
00:23:28,030 --> 00:23:29,170
Good luck!

696
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:30,800
- Mo!
- Mo!

697
00:23:30,800 --> 00:23:31,830
(They scream.)

698
00:23:32,440 --> 00:23:34,340
- Are you kidding me?
- This is crazy!

699
00:23:34,410 --> 00:23:35,950
- What did they get?
- This is crazy!

700
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:37,540
- No way.
- This is insane.

701
00:23:37,540 --> 00:23:38,920
- Mo is possible.
- Hold on.

702
00:23:39,110 --> 00:23:41,280
- Okay.
- Turn around.

703
00:23:41,280 --> 00:23:42,890
- This is it.
- You guys were being loud.

704
00:23:42,890 --> 00:23:44,920
- What happened?
- You got a mo?

705
00:23:44,920 --> 00:23:46,250
(Team Red puts forth a new piece.)

706
00:23:46,250 --> 00:23:47,630
- We did get it.
- They're baiting us.

707
00:23:47,630 --> 00:23:49,430
- We got it.
- They're telling the truth.

708
00:23:49,430 --> 00:23:51,130
- We got it.
- You really got a mo?

709
00:23:51,130 --> 00:23:52,790
- Really?
- Mo?

710
00:23:52,790 --> 00:23:54,790
- We'll take the shortcut.
- Right.

711
00:23:54,790 --> 00:23:56,820
- We did get a mo.
- That is possible.

712
00:23:56,820 --> 00:23:57,940
- We got it.
- Okay.

713
00:23:57,940 --> 00:23:59,240
Who threw the sticks?

714
00:23:59,400 --> 00:24:00,640
- Chanmi.
- Chanmi.

715
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:02,560
- Chanmi?
- Trust me.

716
00:24:02,560 --> 00:24:04,180
I'll put my meal ticket on the line
and say that they're lying.

717
00:24:04,180 --> 00:24:05,380
- What?
- What?

718
00:24:05,380 --> 00:24:06,500
Trust me.

719
00:24:06,500 --> 00:24:09,100
(She doesn't think
they're telling the truth.)

720
00:24:09,340 --> 00:24:11,510
- No, look at them.
- Chanmi isn't a good liar.

721
00:24:11,510 --> 00:24:14,450
They're not lying.
They're just trying to trick us.

722
00:24:14,450 --> 00:24:15,840
- Do whatever you wish.
- Five.

723
00:24:16,340 --> 00:24:17,850
- Four.
- I won't look.

724
00:24:17,850 --> 00:24:19,490
- Three.
- It'll be your meal ticket.

725
00:24:19,660 --> 00:24:21,080
- Two.
- Okay.

726
00:24:21,080 --> 00:24:22,130
- One.
- I'll put mine on the line.

727
00:24:22,130 --> 00:24:23,190
For this round...

728
00:24:23,190 --> 00:24:24,230
(Team Blue thinks they're lying.)

729
00:24:24,230 --> 00:24:26,930
(Did they really get a mo or not?)

730
00:24:26,930 --> 00:24:29,090
(What's the result.)

731
00:24:29,090 --> 00:24:30,130
They told the truth.

732
00:24:30,130 --> 00:24:33,200
(Team Red did get a mo.)

733
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:34,470
I told you.

734
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:36,260
It's beginner's luck.

735
00:24:36,260 --> 00:24:37,410
That was great.

736
00:24:38,070 --> 00:24:40,500
See? It's beginner's luck.

737
00:24:40,500 --> 00:24:41,500
That was great.

738
00:24:42,070 --> 00:24:44,250
- Jimin...
- Jimin...

739
00:24:44,250 --> 00:24:45,880
You don't need to hand over
your meal ticket.

740
00:24:45,880 --> 00:24:47,250
Just remove your team's piece.

741
00:24:47,250 --> 00:24:48,540
- You need to remove your piece.
- What?

742
00:24:48,540 --> 00:24:50,390
- Really? Not the meal ticket?
- It's the piece?

743
00:24:50,610 --> 00:24:52,610
You'll hand over the ticket
if you have no pieces left.

744
00:24:52,990 --> 00:24:54,490
You need to start
from the beginning.

745
00:24:54,490 --> 00:24:56,750
We'll hand over our ticket
and keep the piece.

746
00:24:58,460 --> 00:25:00,430
- I didn't know.
- Me neither.

747
00:25:00,430 --> 00:25:01,820
He told us before.

748
00:25:02,090 --> 00:25:03,730
- Get rid of it.
- I'm sorry.

749
00:25:03,730 --> 00:25:05,790
We're too impulsive.

750
00:25:06,140 --> 00:25:08,830
(She's the most impulsive.)

751
00:25:08,940 --> 00:25:10,560
- Let's go on.
- Chanmi.

752
00:25:10,560 --> 00:25:12,500
- Get a do, gae, geol, or yut.
- I feel pressured.

753
00:25:13,180 --> 00:25:14,750
Yut. It's the best.

754
00:25:14,750 --> 00:25:16,210
- Yut.
- Hold on.

755
00:25:16,210 --> 00:25:17,770
No, gae and geol are both good
as well.

756
00:25:18,540 --> 00:25:21,190
- Geol is better.
- They're all good.

757
00:25:21,310 --> 00:25:22,390
- I feel pressured.
- Chanmi.

758
00:25:22,390 --> 00:25:23,580
- They're all good. Don't be.
- Chanmi, you can do it.

759
00:25:23,580 --> 00:25:24,890
- I can get anything, right?
- Hey.

760
00:25:24,890 --> 00:25:25,990
- Yes.
- Chanmi.

761
00:25:25,990 --> 00:25:27,490
Beginner's luck really does exist.

762
00:25:27,490 --> 00:25:29,230
That's right. You can do it!

763
00:25:31,660 --> 00:25:33,130
No way.

764
00:25:34,700 --> 00:25:36,260
- They're acting strange.
- They are.

765
00:25:36,260 --> 00:25:37,740
How strange.
They're being so awkward.

766
00:25:37,740 --> 00:25:38,760
You're right.

767
00:25:38,760 --> 00:25:40,760
- That was so weird.
- It sounded awkward.

768
00:25:40,970 --> 00:25:42,800
Let's forget about
advancing the normal way...

769
00:25:42,800 --> 00:25:44,740
and move our pieces
by catching their lies.

770
00:25:44,740 --> 00:25:45,740
(A new strategy)

771
00:25:45,740 --> 00:25:47,180
Advancing the normal way...

772
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:50,180
- So...
- If you had listened to me,

773
00:25:50,180 --> 00:25:52,720
- we would've been fine.
- But you...

774
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:55,220
I let you because
you didn't want to.

775
00:25:55,540 --> 00:25:57,040
Please turn around.

776
00:25:57,250 --> 00:25:59,080
You won't believe
what Chanmi just did.

777
00:25:59,160 --> 00:26:00,850
- She threw a back-do.
- A back-do.

778
00:26:00,850 --> 00:26:01,890
- A back-do.
- What?

779
00:26:01,890 --> 00:26:04,250
We captured Team Green's piece.

780
00:26:04,250 --> 00:26:06,460
Hold on. Who has a meal ticket left?

781
00:26:06,750 --> 00:26:08,170
- I have one.
- You're going that way?

782
00:26:08,170 --> 00:26:10,360
- I have some left.
- Seriously?

783
00:26:10,360 --> 00:26:11,900
- That's impossible.
- You'll be left with nothing.

784
00:26:11,900 --> 00:26:13,470
Show us how you moved
your piece again.

785
00:26:13,470 --> 00:26:15,240
Can you not get so emotional?

786
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:18,140
What? When did we get emotional?

787
00:26:18,140 --> 00:26:19,800
- You're awful at games.
- It's for real.

788
00:26:19,800 --> 00:26:20,880
We're awful at this game?

789
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:23,600
- Yes, am I wrong?
- Pay attention to our pieces.

790
00:26:23,680 --> 00:26:24,980
He really is a fuddy-duddy...

791
00:26:24,980 --> 00:26:27,150
because he keeps acting
like a leader among us.

792
00:26:27,150 --> 00:26:29,720
(He keeps acting
like a leader among us.)

793
00:26:29,720 --> 00:26:30,720
(Haha is proven to be
a fuddy-duddy.)

794
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:33,510
What did I even say?
I mean you three...

795
00:26:33,510 --> 00:26:34,520
The trick...

796
00:26:34,520 --> 00:26:36,050
- He tells us off.
- You guys insisted.

797
00:26:36,050 --> 00:26:38,460
- He acts like Jong Kook here.
- He nags us.

798
00:26:38,730 --> 00:26:40,590
- From what I see...
- They agree.

799
00:26:40,590 --> 00:26:42,170
- Unbelievable.
- Bet a meal ticket.

800
00:26:42,170 --> 00:26:43,900
I'll bet mine. You're lying.

801
00:26:43,900 --> 00:26:46,140
- We call the lie.
- They're lying.

802
00:26:46,140 --> 00:26:49,140
- The back-do...
- So what Team Red got...

803
00:26:49,760 --> 00:26:51,770
(Did Team Red
really throw a back-do?)

804
00:26:51,770 --> 00:26:54,980
(Team Blue's meal ticket
is on the line.)

805
00:26:56,150 --> 00:26:57,450
They're telling the truth.

806
00:26:58,070 --> 00:26:59,070
Nice!

807
00:26:59,070 --> 00:27:00,270
Chanmi, good job.

808
00:27:00,270 --> 00:27:01,390
No way.

809
00:27:01,390 --> 00:27:02,780
- Chanmi...
- You're the best.

810
00:27:02,780 --> 00:27:05,010
They're telling the truth.
Please give up your meal ticket.

811
00:27:05,010 --> 00:27:06,960
She threw a back-do?

812
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:09,350
(Team Blue must forfeit
another meal ticket.)

813
00:27:09,930 --> 00:27:12,400
Why do you keep giving up
your meal tickets?

814
00:27:12,430 --> 00:27:14,320
- You don't have many left.
- She threw a back-do...

815
00:27:14,320 --> 00:27:15,760
so we captured Team Green's piece.

816
00:27:16,060 --> 00:27:17,860
- Don't you get it?
- At this rate,

817
00:27:17,860 --> 00:27:19,860
you'll be asked
to leave the restaurant.

818
00:27:19,900 --> 00:27:20,970
What are you going to do?

819
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:22,970
- Let's go crazy now.
- Sure thing.

820
00:27:22,970 --> 00:27:24,380
I just don't care anymore.

821
00:27:24,380 --> 00:27:27,240
I bet you're thinking
about lying next.

822
00:27:27,240 --> 00:27:28,300
Gosh.

823
00:27:28,540 --> 00:27:31,150
Is this about the right timing?

824
00:27:31,480 --> 00:27:34,220
They're backed into a corner,
so the timing fits.

825
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:36,450
- We don't have any pieces on.
- let's do this.

826
00:27:36,450 --> 00:27:38,190
It's a perfect time to lie.

827
00:27:38,190 --> 00:27:39,460
(What they get will be important.)

828
00:27:39,460 --> 00:27:42,750
(Team Blue gets a gae.)

829
00:27:42,750 --> 00:27:44,700
Okay!

830
00:27:46,050 --> 00:27:47,350
(The forced reaction
makes them burst into laughter.)

831
00:27:47,350 --> 00:27:48,700
We got this.

832
00:27:48,700 --> 00:27:50,730
- He was too conscious of it.
- Exactly.

833
00:27:50,730 --> 00:27:52,760
- This is a lie.
- You were too late.

834
00:27:52,760 --> 00:27:55,210
I'm sure you all heard it too,

835
00:27:55,240 --> 00:27:56,410
but he yelled just from his throat.

836
00:27:56,410 --> 00:27:58,140
No way!

837
00:27:58,180 --> 00:27:59,330
Let's just turn around.

838
00:27:59,770 --> 00:28:01,480
- Don't react in any way.
- Are we good?

839
00:28:01,480 --> 00:28:02,980
- Please turn around.
- We placed our piece.

840
00:28:02,980 --> 00:28:04,380
He only yelled from his throat.

841
00:28:04,380 --> 00:28:05,980
Unbelievable.

842
00:28:05,980 --> 00:28:07,270
They caught Team Green's piece.

843
00:28:07,270 --> 00:28:09,340
- Ours?
- All right.

844
00:28:09,720 --> 00:28:11,810
- Let's call their lie.
- We don't need to though.

845
00:28:11,810 --> 00:28:14,460
- There's no need to risk it.
- We don't have to step forward.

846
00:28:14,460 --> 00:28:16,160
- It's up to Team Green.
- They already seem grim.

847
00:28:16,160 --> 00:28:17,550
- Look at them.
- Only one team should call the lie.

848
00:28:17,550 --> 00:28:18,630
They don't seem to be at ease.

849
00:28:18,630 --> 00:28:20,230
It's easy to get a geol.

850
00:28:21,170 --> 00:28:24,130
Isn't Jimin acting
like she's nervous?

851
00:28:24,130 --> 00:28:25,740
- Right.
- Right?

852
00:28:25,740 --> 00:28:27,260
- Geol...
- Hold on a second.

853
00:28:27,260 --> 00:28:28,710
- We don't need to...
- Give us some time.

854
00:28:28,710 --> 00:28:29,800
We have nothing to lose.

855
00:28:29,800 --> 00:28:32,180
You don't need to take our spot...

856
00:28:32,180 --> 00:28:34,800
- because you're ahead of us.
- He's stopping us.

857
00:28:34,800 --> 00:28:36,380
(Kwang Soo's reaction
only makes them suspect him more.)

858
00:28:36,380 --> 00:28:38,180
(Busted?)

859
00:28:38,180 --> 00:28:40,980
- All right. "Trick!"
- "Trick!"

860
00:28:40,980 --> 00:28:42,010
(It's a trick!)

861
00:28:42,010 --> 00:28:44,010
- Trick...
- Team Blue...

862
00:28:44,810 --> 00:28:45,850
was lying.

863
00:28:45,850 --> 00:28:47,350
(It was a trick.)

864
00:28:47,350 --> 00:28:49,320
(Team Blue never got a geol.)

865
00:28:49,320 --> 00:28:51,350
- I knew it.
- It was too obvious.

866
00:28:51,350 --> 00:28:52,500
Why did you have to talk so much?

867
00:28:52,500 --> 00:28:54,350
- Seriously?
- You should've kept quiet.

868
00:28:54,350 --> 00:28:55,560
He talked too much.

869
00:28:55,560 --> 00:28:56,560
- Too much.
- I was nervous.

870
00:28:56,560 --> 00:28:58,500
Kwang Soo tried to stop us.

871
00:28:58,500 --> 00:29:00,860
- Why talk at all?
- He talks too much.

872
00:29:00,860 --> 00:29:02,500
We could tell by your face.

873
00:29:02,500 --> 00:29:06,270
Remove Team Blue's piece
and move any of your pieces.

874
00:29:06,500 --> 00:29:08,300
- We're off to paradise.
- 1, 2, 3.

875
00:29:08,300 --> 00:29:10,270
- Paradise.
- Nice!

876
00:29:10,270 --> 00:29:11,810
(Team Red's piece
moves three spaces.)

877
00:29:11,810 --> 00:29:12,880
Let's go!

878
00:29:12,880 --> 00:29:14,580
- We're on a roll.
- Do, gae, geol...

879
00:29:14,580 --> 00:29:15,990
Do, gae, geol, yut.

880
00:29:15,990 --> 00:29:17,610
We only need a yut.

881
00:29:17,610 --> 00:29:19,050
Do we need a yut now?

882
00:29:19,050 --> 00:29:20,960
- But if we get a gae...
- We'll be in trouble.

883
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:22,730
We won't be able
to avoid the fire pit.

884
00:29:22,730 --> 00:29:25,160
Then that's all we have to avoid.

885
00:29:25,250 --> 00:29:27,550
Hold on. Why are you guys arguing?

886
00:29:27,550 --> 00:29:28,670
(Why are you guys arguing?)

887
00:29:29,260 --> 00:29:31,020
I'd rather play this game alone.

888
00:29:31,240 --> 00:29:32,360
Same here.

889
00:29:32,360 --> 00:29:33,900
- I'd...
- I want you all to shut it.

890
00:29:33,900 --> 00:29:35,740
If you hadn't yelled,

891
00:29:35,740 --> 00:29:37,560
- we wouldn't have been caught.
- Exactly.

892
00:29:37,560 --> 00:29:39,800
You talked too much though.

893
00:29:39,800 --> 00:29:40,800
- I was shocked.
- It's all because of you.

894
00:29:40,800 --> 00:29:42,650
Want to know
the expression you had?

895
00:29:42,650 --> 00:29:43,680
I...

896
00:29:43,910 --> 00:29:46,540
- We're not on the same page.
- Not at all.

897
00:29:46,540 --> 00:29:48,540
Let's each toss one
of the yut-sticks.

898
00:29:48,540 --> 00:29:50,080
- We won't take turns.
- Good idea.

899
00:29:50,080 --> 00:29:51,660
Don't react in any way.

900
00:29:51,660 --> 00:29:52,960
- No.
- Don't.

901
00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:54,850
- Okay.
- Kwang Soo, you especially.

902
00:29:54,850 --> 00:29:55,960
Watch it.

903
00:29:56,190 --> 00:29:57,580
(He's upset.)

904
00:29:57,580 --> 00:29:59,660
- You're the problem though.
- Okay, fine.

905
00:29:59,660 --> 00:30:01,320
The problematic Team Blue is up.

906
00:30:01,930 --> 00:30:03,900
- You seem grim.
- Everybody, sit.

907
00:30:03,900 --> 00:30:05,470
Look at them.

908
00:30:05,470 --> 00:30:07,170
- Wait.
- They're throwing one each.

909
00:30:07,170 --> 00:30:08,170
One each?

910
00:30:08,170 --> 00:30:10,170
- We'll give it a go.
- It'll be confusing.

911
00:30:10,170 --> 00:30:12,380
- They're a mess.
- Tell me about it.

912
00:30:12,740 --> 00:30:14,180
1, 2, 3.

913
00:30:14,330 --> 00:30:15,880
- Wait.
- Aren't we tossing all at once?

914
00:30:15,880 --> 00:30:17,500
- Are you done?
- Not yet.

915
00:30:18,450 --> 00:30:19,650
Are you done?

916
00:30:20,270 --> 00:30:22,390
(The second yut-stick
is also facing up.)

917
00:30:24,550 --> 00:30:27,250
(Even Jimin's yut-stick is
facing up.)

918
00:30:27,250 --> 00:30:29,520
(Last but not least,
Kwang Soo throws his.)

919
00:30:31,500 --> 00:30:33,700
(Kwang Soo's stick
is also facing up.)

920
00:30:33,700 --> 00:30:37,320
(Team Blue throws a yut!)

921
00:30:37,320 --> 00:30:39,260
(Nice!)

922
00:30:39,260 --> 00:30:41,360
(They keep quiet
just like they agreed.)

923
00:30:41,360 --> 00:30:42,670
They must've messed up.

924
00:30:42,670 --> 00:30:44,770
They're lying for sure,
so let's call them out.

925
00:30:44,770 --> 00:30:45,980
- Please turn around.
- Sure.

926
00:30:45,980 --> 00:30:48,710
- What is it?
- They say they got a yut.

927
00:30:49,570 --> 00:30:50,880
(They all laugh at the news.)

928
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:52,180
- What?
- We'll call them out.

929
00:30:52,180 --> 00:30:53,610
So Min's shoulder is cramping.

930
00:30:53,610 --> 00:30:55,080
- Let's do this.
- Stop talking.

931
00:30:55,080 --> 00:30:56,150
It's a trick.

932
00:30:56,390 --> 00:30:58,080
Shall we call their lie too?

933
00:30:58,080 --> 00:30:59,960
- Right.
- Let's call it.

934
00:30:59,960 --> 00:31:01,250
- It's a trick.
- Shall we?

935
00:31:01,250 --> 00:31:02,990
- It's a lie.
- Go ahead, guys.

936
00:31:03,130 --> 00:31:04,900
Okay, we'll call it.

937
00:31:04,900 --> 00:31:06,520
- A trick?
- It's a trick.

938
00:31:06,520 --> 00:31:09,000
(The two teams will counter.)

939
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:10,260
(Just call it.)

940
00:31:10,500 --> 00:31:11,590
- It's a trick.
- They're lying.

941
00:31:11,940 --> 00:31:13,670
Team Blue is telling the truth.

942
00:31:13,670 --> 00:31:15,240
(The truth!)

943
00:31:15,240 --> 00:31:17,640
(Team Blue really did get a yut.)

944
00:31:17,640 --> 00:31:19,180
(I'm glad we didn't call them out.)

945
00:31:19,180 --> 00:31:20,770
Nice!

946
00:31:20,770 --> 00:31:22,380
(Team Blue finally comes together.)

947
00:31:22,380 --> 00:31:23,800
No way.

948
00:31:24,380 --> 00:31:26,450
Good job, guys. Nice.

949
00:31:26,880 --> 00:31:29,190
It's all about that
one lucky punch. Yes!

950
00:31:29,190 --> 00:31:31,010
I can't believe we did it.

951
00:31:31,010 --> 00:31:33,220
- You all did great.
- Anyway,

952
00:31:33,220 --> 00:31:35,490
the image we built
played a huge part.

953
00:31:35,490 --> 00:31:36,850
- You're right.
- Exactly.

954
00:31:37,460 --> 00:31:39,850
- We can catch them with a geol.
- Right.

955
00:31:39,850 --> 00:31:42,060
We can catch Team Red's piece
resting in paradise.

956
00:31:42,060 --> 00:31:43,560
- You only need a geol.
- A geol.

957
00:31:43,560 --> 00:31:45,560
- We need a geol.
- Yut, mo, geol is fine.

958
00:31:45,560 --> 00:31:46,760
Just don't let it be do or gae.

959
00:31:46,760 --> 00:31:48,740
- Don't feel pressured.
- We'll go ahead.

960
00:31:48,740 --> 00:31:49,830
We won't blame you.

961
00:31:49,830 --> 00:31:51,480
Throw them up high.

962
00:31:51,480 --> 00:31:53,980
(What did he throw?)

963
00:31:54,570 --> 00:31:58,980
They must've decided
not to react in any way.

964
00:31:59,010 --> 00:32:00,340
I heard something though.

965
00:32:00,340 --> 00:32:01,610
Me too.

966
00:32:01,650 --> 00:32:03,190
- Right?
- Please turn around.

967
00:32:03,190 --> 00:32:05,310
- They didn't get anything good.
- They've already set the bait.

968
00:32:05,310 --> 00:32:07,610
- You caught us?
- What?

969
00:32:07,610 --> 00:32:09,320
(Startled)

970
00:32:10,630 --> 00:32:12,400
(Team Blue is claiming...)

971
00:32:12,400 --> 00:32:14,160
(that they caught
Team Red's piece in paradise.)

972
00:32:14,160 --> 00:32:15,500
We got a geol,
went to paradise and...

973
00:32:15,500 --> 00:32:17,320
- Who threw the sticks?
- Haha did.

974
00:32:17,320 --> 00:32:18,740
- Haha did.
- Haha?

975
00:32:19,140 --> 00:32:20,330
- Yes.
- Haha did.

976
00:32:20,560 --> 00:32:23,170
I think they're telling the truth.

977
00:32:23,170 --> 00:32:27,100
The bait they've set up so far
is working.

978
00:32:27,240 --> 00:32:29,770
Team Red is the victim,
so let's wait and see.

979
00:32:29,800 --> 00:32:31,340
I'm sure they'll take action.

980
00:32:31,340 --> 00:32:34,010
If this is a trick though,
we'll have to start from zero.

981
00:32:34,010 --> 00:32:35,250
- We can't ever catch up with them.
- Five.

982
00:32:36,150 --> 00:32:37,610
- Four.
- We have to take the risk.

983
00:32:37,610 --> 00:32:38,850
- We have to.
- But they're telling the truth.

984
00:32:38,850 --> 00:32:40,660
- It's the truth.
- They're telling the truth.

985
00:32:40,660 --> 00:32:42,630
- Two.
- I'm sure of it.

986
00:32:42,630 --> 00:32:45,050
- One. No one's calling them out?
- They're slightly smiling.

987
00:32:45,050 --> 00:32:46,130
Team Blue is telling...

988
00:32:46,130 --> 00:32:47,500
(Team Blue is telling...)

989
00:32:47,500 --> 00:32:48,630
It's the truth.

990
00:32:49,430 --> 00:32:50,930
Nice.

991
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:52,860
I can't believe they're in the lead.

992
00:32:52,860 --> 00:32:54,330
Okay, good.
We shook up the entire game.

993
00:32:54,330 --> 00:32:56,060
- We turned it upside down.
- Exactly.

994
00:32:56,060 --> 00:32:57,360
The balance has been tilted.

995
00:32:57,360 --> 00:32:58,740
- Tilted?
- We're almost there.

996
00:32:58,740 --> 00:33:00,530
Double or nothing, guys?

997
00:33:00,530 --> 00:33:02,180
- Go for it.
- Nice.

998
00:33:02,380 --> 00:33:04,250
- Get lost if you're scared.
- We need them to get a gae...

999
00:33:04,250 --> 00:33:05,310
and drop into the pit.

1000
00:33:06,980 --> 00:33:08,720
(Will they take a step closer
to win the game...)

1001
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:10,450
(or will they plummet
into the fire pit?)

1002
00:33:10,450 --> 00:33:11,750
(What did they throw?)

1003
00:33:11,750 --> 00:33:13,750
They promised not to react
in any way.

1004
00:33:14,660 --> 00:33:16,580
- Right...
- And that's more confusing.

1005
00:33:16,580 --> 00:33:18,160
It's about time you're scared now.

1006
00:33:18,160 --> 00:33:19,850
Please turn around.

1007
00:33:19,850 --> 00:33:21,790
- What did you get?
- A do.

1008
00:33:22,060 --> 00:33:24,560
(They're claiming that
they avoided the fire pit.)

1009
00:33:24,560 --> 00:33:26,360
- A do?
- Then that's probably true.

1010
00:33:26,360 --> 00:33:29,140
There's a high possibility
that they got a gae.

1011
00:33:29,140 --> 00:33:30,170
- Right.
- Because that means the fire pit.

1012
00:33:30,170 --> 00:33:31,980
You're right!

1013
00:33:31,980 --> 00:33:35,750
(Did they claim to have gotten a do
to escape the fire pit?)

1014
00:33:35,750 --> 00:33:37,680
- If they had gotten a gae...
- We'd add a new piece.

1015
00:33:37,680 --> 00:33:39,340
- We would've added a new piece.
- Right.

1016
00:33:39,340 --> 00:33:41,270
But then they could
easily be caught.

1017
00:33:41,270 --> 00:33:42,280
- Hold on.
- No.

1018
00:33:42,280 --> 00:33:43,690
- If they got a gae...
- They're telling the truth.

1019
00:33:43,690 --> 00:33:44,720
- Right.
- I agree.

1020
00:33:44,720 --> 00:33:46,610
- Do is hard to get.
- It's not easy to get a do.

1021
00:33:46,610 --> 00:33:49,520
- 5, 4...
- They've set the bait so well.

1022
00:33:49,520 --> 00:33:50,960
- Three...
- What do you say?

1023
00:33:50,960 --> 00:33:53,000
(Glancing)

1024
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:54,200
- What do you say?
- Call it.

1025
00:33:54,250 --> 00:33:55,520
- It's a "trick."
- "Trick!"

1026
00:33:55,520 --> 00:33:56,700
(Let's call it.)

1027
00:33:56,700 --> 00:33:57,700
- Really?
- Are you sure?

1028
00:33:57,700 --> 00:33:59,360
- I don't think so.
- It's a trick.

1029
00:33:59,360 --> 00:34:01,860
(They claimed it a trick even though
their teammates are doubtful.)

1030
00:34:01,860 --> 00:34:04,980
(Is Team Blue telling the truth?)

1031
00:34:05,410 --> 00:34:09,250
- It's the truth.
- What did I tell you?

1032
00:34:09,250 --> 00:34:12,920
(Team Blue dramatically
gets a do which saved them.)

1033
00:34:12,920 --> 00:34:14,780
(Bitter...)

1034
00:34:14,780 --> 00:34:15,980
Right, of course.

1035
00:34:15,980 --> 00:34:17,920
We're only confident
when we're not lying.

1036
00:34:17,920 --> 00:34:20,360
It's all about having
nothing to lose.

1037
00:34:20,360 --> 00:34:22,260
This could've gone south.

1038
00:34:22,590 --> 00:34:23,590
Are you kidding me?

1039
00:34:23,590 --> 00:34:25,230
- Exactly.
- We're in the lead now.

1040
00:34:25,590 --> 00:34:27,000
How dramatic is this?

1041
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:28,130
Yutnori is so much fun.

1042
00:34:28,130 --> 00:34:30,360
- Being confident is the key.
- Our team...

1043
00:34:30,360 --> 00:34:32,260
- You're right.
- The situation is bad.

1044
00:34:32,260 --> 00:34:34,170
- Let's catch that piece.
- Why am I nervous?

1045
00:34:34,170 --> 00:34:36,360
(Team Red is cornered,
but what did they throw?)

1046
00:34:37,130 --> 00:34:39,340
Darn it. I can't believe it.

1047
00:34:39,670 --> 00:34:40,940
Talk about a disappointment.

1048
00:34:41,750 --> 00:34:42,800
This is disappointing.

1049
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:44,280
(Team Red places a new piece
with geol.)

1050
00:34:44,280 --> 00:34:46,510
Geol? We'll let them have that one.

1051
00:34:46,510 --> 00:34:48,480
Right. Is it our turn then?

1052
00:34:48,750 --> 00:34:49,980
We'll catch Team Red's piece.

1053
00:34:49,980 --> 00:34:51,760
- This is so disappointing.
- Well...

1054
00:34:51,760 --> 00:34:52,760
Let them have it.

1055
00:34:52,760 --> 00:34:55,130
Is no one calling them out?
Well, Team Red...

1056
00:34:55,130 --> 00:34:56,130
lied.

1057
00:34:56,130 --> 00:34:57,960
(They lied!)

1058
00:34:59,050 --> 00:35:00,630
(Team Red lied about
getting a geol.)

1059
00:35:00,630 --> 00:35:01,900
What did you throw?

1060
00:35:01,900 --> 00:35:03,260
- A gae.
- A gae.

1061
00:35:03,260 --> 00:35:04,460
It was a gae.

1062
00:35:04,460 --> 00:35:06,170
Right, we'll be as sly as we can.

1063
00:35:06,170 --> 00:35:08,360
You take no chances at all, do you?

1064
00:35:08,360 --> 00:35:10,530
(You take no chances at all,
do you?)

1065
00:35:11,230 --> 00:35:13,010
- Cowards.
- Go, team!

1066
00:35:13,070 --> 00:35:15,670
- We'll be as sly as possible.
- All right.

1067
00:35:15,670 --> 00:35:17,480
You lied just to advance
one more step?

1068
00:35:18,070 --> 00:35:19,750
That's what you lied for?

1069
00:35:19,750 --> 00:35:20,840
Okay!

1070
00:35:20,980 --> 00:35:23,380
We must get a geol and catch it.

1071
00:35:23,380 --> 00:35:25,210
If they do, call their lie.

1072
00:35:25,510 --> 00:35:26,710
Oh, no...

1073
00:35:26,710 --> 00:35:27,880
Okay.

1074
00:35:27,880 --> 00:35:29,860
(Hyejeong aims to get a geol.)

1075
00:35:29,860 --> 00:35:32,500
(But she throws a gae.)

1076
00:35:33,500 --> 00:35:35,690
(It's a gae.)

1077
00:35:35,690 --> 00:35:38,000
(It should've been a geol.)

1078
00:35:38,570 --> 00:35:39,630
They can't have caught us.

1079
00:35:39,630 --> 00:35:41,730
(It's Team Green's turn
to move their piece.)

1080
00:35:42,510 --> 00:35:43,570
Are you done?

1081
00:35:43,570 --> 00:35:44,940
(Will they be honest
and advance two steps?)

1082
00:35:45,630 --> 00:35:47,380
- We're done.
- Okay.

1083
00:35:47,530 --> 00:35:49,150
You didn't catch us, did you?
You did?

1084
00:35:50,010 --> 00:35:52,880
Team Green said they got a geol
and caught Team Red's piece.

1085
00:35:52,940 --> 00:35:54,420
- Guys.
- Unbelievable.

1086
00:35:54,480 --> 00:35:56,750
- We should catch them out.
- You really threw a geol?

1087
00:35:57,480 --> 00:35:58,610
We did.

1088
00:35:58,610 --> 00:36:00,110
Seolhyun, did you get a geol?

1089
00:36:00,210 --> 00:36:01,210
Yes.

1090
00:36:02,030 --> 00:36:03,980
- The thing is...
- We don't have to be there.

1091
00:36:03,980 --> 00:36:05,630
We have two pieces on the board.
We can leave them there.

1092
00:36:05,630 --> 00:36:06,800
- It doesn't matter.
- Right.

1093
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:07,960
Kwang Soo.

1094
00:36:07,960 --> 00:36:10,170
We'll pass.
You guys can call them out.

1095
00:36:10,260 --> 00:36:12,090
- No, we don't want to.
- We can't.

1096
00:36:12,090 --> 00:36:14,170
- You're not as stupid as I thought.
- We don't want to.

1097
00:36:14,590 --> 00:36:16,030
(You're not as stupid as I thought.)

1098
00:36:16,030 --> 00:36:17,400
Why do you look down on him?

1099
00:36:17,460 --> 00:36:19,210
I thought he'd fall for it,
but he didn't.

1100
00:36:19,210 --> 00:36:20,840
Kwang Soo is not stupid!

1101
00:36:20,840 --> 00:36:22,300
I thought he'd fall for it,
but he didn't.

1102
00:36:22,670 --> 00:36:24,880
(Kwang Soo is not stupid.)

1103
00:36:24,880 --> 00:36:26,010
Too bad.

1104
00:36:26,050 --> 00:36:27,780
- No objection?
- No.

1105
00:36:27,840 --> 00:36:28,980
What they said was...

1106
00:36:29,050 --> 00:36:30,150
- a trick.
- What?

1107
00:36:30,150 --> 00:36:31,710
(What they said was a lie.)

1108
00:36:31,710 --> 00:36:33,090
(Team Green
didn't really get a geol.)

1109
00:36:33,090 --> 00:36:34,880
- I knew it.
- It was a lie?

1110
00:36:35,650 --> 00:36:37,480
Everyone seems to trust us.

1111
00:36:37,480 --> 00:36:39,460
- Are you guys getting impatient?
- Yes.

1112
00:36:39,460 --> 00:36:40,460
Did you have to catch that piece?

1113
00:36:40,460 --> 00:36:42,320
Finally, the dirty game has started!

1114
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:44,190
This is our chance!

1115
00:36:44,190 --> 00:36:45,440
(The dirty game begins.)

1116
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:47,000
- Double or nothing!
- Double or nothing!

1117
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:48,730
Let's turn this around.
Double or nothing!

1118
00:36:48,840 --> 00:36:49,940
Hyejeong.

1119
00:36:50,510 --> 00:36:51,610
- It's okay.
- Hyejeong.

1120
00:36:51,610 --> 00:36:53,010
Let's not show any reaction.

1121
00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:54,340
Okay!

1122
00:36:54,340 --> 00:36:56,050
(The yut-sticks are thrown.)

1123
00:36:56,050 --> 00:36:57,650
(They look surprised
but keep quiet.)

1124
00:36:58,750 --> 00:37:01,610
(What's the result?)

1125
00:37:02,440 --> 00:37:04,010
Their reaction is genuine now.

1126
00:37:04,010 --> 00:37:05,380
(They're not showing any reaction.)

1127
00:37:05,380 --> 00:37:06,590
- We're done.
- Please wait.

1128
00:37:06,590 --> 00:37:08,960
It has to be true. What did they do?

1129
00:37:09,150 --> 00:37:11,090
They say they threw a mo.

1130
00:37:11,090 --> 00:37:12,400
- A mo?
- A mo?

1131
00:37:13,630 --> 00:37:15,900
(Are you sure you got a mo?)

1132
00:37:15,900 --> 00:37:17,070
Put it up.

1133
00:37:17,690 --> 00:37:19,400
- Hold on.
- Maybe not.

1134
00:37:19,400 --> 00:37:20,400
- Maybe not.
- Wait.

1135
00:37:20,440 --> 00:37:23,010
- No. It's too risky.
- I'm positive.

1136
00:37:23,130 --> 00:37:24,260
Let them be there.

1137
00:37:24,260 --> 00:37:25,610
We have...

1138
00:37:25,610 --> 00:37:27,170
- nothing to lose.
- We...

1139
00:37:27,230 --> 00:37:28,800
Bring it on!

1140
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:30,750
- Double or nothing!
- Bring it on!

1141
00:37:30,750 --> 00:37:32,070
- Double or nothing!
- Let's do this!

1142
00:37:32,170 --> 00:37:34,210
- Let's take a vote.
- Hold on.

1143
00:37:34,210 --> 00:37:37,780
Do they really have the guts?

1144
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:39,010
They don't.

1145
00:37:39,010 --> 00:37:40,690
They got a do
but are calling it a gae.

1146
00:37:41,460 --> 00:37:42,460
What are you saying?

1147
00:37:42,460 --> 00:37:44,360
We're not timid people.

1148
00:37:44,480 --> 00:37:47,400
- But they couldn't lie about a mo.
- We're not timid people.

1149
00:37:47,400 --> 00:37:48,760
- Should we?
- Yes, call them out.

1150
00:37:48,760 --> 00:37:50,690
- Let's do it.
- This time...

1151
00:37:51,090 --> 00:37:52,260
I think they're telling the truth.

1152
00:37:52,460 --> 00:37:54,090
- Three,
- Hurry up.

1153
00:37:54,090 --> 00:37:55,670
- two,
- Director, hurry up!

1154
00:37:55,670 --> 00:37:57,110
- one.
- Hurry up!

1155
00:37:57,510 --> 00:37:58,880
Time's up. No objection?

1156
00:37:58,880 --> 00:38:00,110
No objection.

1157
00:38:00,110 --> 00:38:01,230
What they said was...

1158
00:38:01,900 --> 00:38:04,900
(Did Team Red really get a mo?)

1159
00:38:04,900 --> 00:38:06,010
- true.
- Yes!

1160
00:38:06,010 --> 00:38:07,170
Good job.

1161
00:38:07,340 --> 00:38:10,610
(Team Red did throw a mo.)

1162
00:38:10,610 --> 00:38:11,880
Why didn't you object?

1163
00:38:11,880 --> 00:38:13,420
I didn't want to!

1164
00:38:13,420 --> 00:38:14,860
I was getting anxious!

1165
00:38:14,860 --> 00:38:17,360
- Why are you blaming me?
- Suk Jin.

1166
00:38:17,360 --> 00:38:19,000
You didn't look anxious at all.

1167
00:38:19,300 --> 00:38:21,050
You looked like a con man
asking for an investment.

1168
00:38:21,230 --> 00:38:22,630
Your eyes were shining.

1169
00:38:22,630 --> 00:38:24,500
- It's so hard to resist.
- Hold back.

1170
00:38:24,900 --> 00:38:26,070
- You shouldn't.
- Let's...

1171
00:38:26,300 --> 00:38:28,230
Let's imagine we don't have this
until our piece is finished.

1172
00:38:28,530 --> 00:38:29,960
- I'll put this away.
- Okay.

1173
00:38:29,960 --> 00:38:31,110
I'll put it here.

1174
00:38:31,110 --> 00:38:32,110
- Until our piece is finished.
- We can't use it.

1175
00:38:32,110 --> 00:38:33,130
Let's start. Let's go.

1176
00:38:33,130 --> 00:38:34,210
Turn around.

1177
00:38:34,210 --> 00:38:35,340
(Team Red gets to throw again.)

1178
00:38:36,880 --> 00:38:39,710
(What did they get this time?)

1179
00:38:40,550 --> 00:38:42,090
(Silent)

1180
00:38:42,980 --> 00:38:45,480
(They look more careful than ever.)

1181
00:38:47,010 --> 00:38:48,210
They're deciding
whether they should turn.

1182
00:38:48,210 --> 00:38:49,690
- We have to stop them.
- Please trust me.

1183
00:38:50,420 --> 00:38:52,090
- Wait!
- Be quiet!

1184
00:38:52,090 --> 00:38:53,820
Why are you doing this?

1185
00:38:53,820 --> 00:38:55,190
You fools!

1186
00:38:55,190 --> 00:38:57,190
- This is not okay.
- Let's hear him out.

1187
00:38:57,190 --> 00:38:59,670
- They're lying.
- They're up to something.

1188
00:38:59,760 --> 00:39:01,760
Suk Jin wants to lie,

1189
00:39:01,900 --> 00:39:02,940
- but the others are stopping him.
- Right.

1190
00:39:02,940 --> 00:39:04,400
Suk Jin sounds exaggerated.

1191
00:39:04,400 --> 00:39:06,340
- Okay.
- Turn around.

1192
00:39:07,170 --> 00:39:08,440
- What happened?
- This is crazy.

1193
00:39:08,440 --> 00:39:09,750
- You got a yut?
- What?

1194
00:39:10,380 --> 00:39:11,550
You got a yut?

1195
00:39:12,110 --> 00:39:13,820
- We were surprised too.
- I can't stand it.

1196
00:39:13,880 --> 00:39:15,190
I can't stand it anymore.

1197
00:39:15,190 --> 00:39:16,690
- I can't stand it.
- I think it's false too.

1198
00:39:16,690 --> 00:39:17,820
- It's false.
- I can't stand it anymore.

1199
00:39:17,820 --> 00:39:19,860
- Suk Jin definitely...
- Come on.

1200
00:39:20,050 --> 00:39:21,280
- We were shocked too.
- We were.

1201
00:39:21,280 --> 00:39:22,650
I thought Hyejeong was crazy.

1202
00:39:22,650 --> 00:39:25,820
- I didn't know she'd be so good.
- We heard you guys argue.

1203
00:39:25,820 --> 00:39:26,960
If you're Tazza,

1204
00:39:26,960 --> 00:39:28,230
she's Yutzza.

1205
00:39:28,230 --> 00:39:29,900
- Is that a thing?
- She's Yutzza.

1206
00:39:29,900 --> 00:39:31,260
Yes, she's Yutzza.

1207
00:39:31,260 --> 00:39:32,670
- We were shocked.
- They're tricking us.

1208
00:39:32,670 --> 00:39:34,440
- I was so surprised.
- Let's speed up.

1209
00:39:34,440 --> 00:39:36,730
- How could you get a yut again?
- It's impossible.

1210
00:39:36,730 --> 00:39:37,800
You threw a mo and then a yut?

1211
00:39:37,940 --> 00:39:39,230
- Can we do it?
- One.

1212
00:39:39,230 --> 00:39:40,530
- Let's do it!
- "Trick!"

1213
00:39:40,670 --> 00:39:42,800
- "Trick!"
- "Trick!"

1214
00:39:42,800 --> 00:39:44,650
Team Blue thinks you're lying.

1215
00:39:44,650 --> 00:39:47,650
(Team Blue thinks it's a lie
and makes Jae Suk smile.)

1216
00:39:48,050 --> 00:39:50,420
- I'm positive.
- It's just impossible.

1217
00:39:50,420 --> 00:39:51,960
I'm sure Suk Jin pushed it.

1218
00:39:51,960 --> 00:39:53,590
- Everyone else was against it.
- We heard them argue.

1219
00:39:53,590 --> 00:39:54,760
Let's speed up.

1220
00:39:54,760 --> 00:39:55,820
- You think I pushed it?
- It's a trick.

1221
00:39:55,820 --> 00:39:56,960
It was true.

1222
00:39:56,960 --> 00:39:59,190
(It was true.)

1223
00:40:00,500 --> 00:40:01,730
Take Team Blue's piece away.

1224
00:40:02,170 --> 00:40:04,820
(No way.)

1225
00:40:05,690 --> 00:40:07,590
(Haha faints.)

1226
00:40:07,590 --> 00:40:09,460
- This is crazy.
- Hold on.

1227
00:40:09,510 --> 00:40:11,530
- The blue piece?
- You're crazy.

1228
00:40:11,840 --> 00:40:14,730
(The blue piece was about to finish
but has to start over now.)

1229
00:40:14,730 --> 00:40:17,980
Why did you have to bring this?

1230
00:40:18,170 --> 00:40:20,440
- Did they buy any items?
- I mean...

1231
00:40:21,320 --> 00:40:22,510
Do you have items?

1232
00:40:23,250 --> 00:40:25,480
- They got a mo and a yut?
- Go, Hyejeong!

1233
00:40:25,480 --> 00:40:26,760
- Move.
- Get out of the way.

1234
00:40:26,760 --> 00:40:28,920
Here comes Hyejeong!

1235
00:40:28,920 --> 00:40:30,530
Hyejeong is on fire today.

1236
00:40:30,530 --> 00:40:31,730
Go, Hyejeong!

1237
00:40:32,420 --> 00:40:34,800
- Why won't you listen to me?
- I couldn't resist.

1238
00:40:34,900 --> 00:40:36,400
You thought it was false too.

1239
00:40:36,400 --> 00:40:37,960
I wanted to hold back.

1240
00:40:37,960 --> 00:40:40,300
- So did I.
- Ji Hyo's team should've called it.

1241
00:40:40,300 --> 00:40:43,170
- But they won't listen.
- Exactly.

1242
00:40:43,170 --> 00:40:45,010
- Anything is fine.
- Just toss anything.

1243
00:40:45,010 --> 00:40:47,280
- A gae is fine too.
- Anything is fine.

1244
00:40:47,340 --> 00:40:49,150
Hyejeong is a yutnori genius.

1245
00:40:50,880 --> 00:40:52,340
(This time,)

1246
00:40:52,340 --> 00:40:53,980
(she throws a do.)

1247
00:40:54,480 --> 00:40:56,420
(Silent)

1248
00:40:57,090 --> 00:40:58,210
Unbelievable.

1249
00:41:00,090 --> 00:41:02,980
(They don't need to think too much.)

1250
00:41:02,980 --> 00:41:04,420
(They move their leading piece
one step forward.)

1251
00:41:04,480 --> 00:41:06,050
Let's move one step forward.

1252
00:41:06,960 --> 00:41:09,190
- Turn around.
- What happened?

1253
00:41:09,190 --> 00:41:11,420
They threw a do
and advanced one step.

1254
00:41:11,590 --> 00:41:13,070
- All right.
- That's...

1255
00:41:13,170 --> 00:41:14,190
But there's a chance...

1256
00:41:14,260 --> 00:41:17,670
they got a gae or a geol
and didn't want to take a risk.

1257
00:41:17,940 --> 00:41:19,840
- Take the risk then.
- They might have wanted to...

1258
00:41:19,840 --> 00:41:21,170
- Call them out.
- Call them out.

1259
00:41:21,300 --> 00:41:23,070
- Call them out. You have one left.
- Five,

1260
00:41:23,070 --> 00:41:25,610
- Should I? Hold on.
- four...

1261
00:41:25,610 --> 00:41:27,650
- They have a problem.
- It's no big deal.

1262
00:41:27,650 --> 00:41:29,440
- They need help.
- Let's do it!

1263
00:41:29,440 --> 00:41:31,280
- You should pass this time.
- It's no big deal.

1264
00:41:31,280 --> 00:41:33,190
- Let's pass this time.
- Let's do it!

1265
00:41:33,360 --> 00:41:34,690
- Let's pass.
- It's a lie.

1266
00:41:35,090 --> 00:41:36,980
They're lying.

1267
00:41:37,230 --> 00:41:38,900
- 1, 2, 3. "Trick!"
- "Trick!"

1268
00:41:38,900 --> 00:41:40,230
(They all say it's a lie.)

1269
00:41:40,230 --> 00:41:41,800
- I'm 100 percent sure.
- It was...

1270
00:41:41,920 --> 00:41:43,090
- true.
- Darn it.

1271
00:41:43,090 --> 00:41:44,500
(True)

1272
00:41:45,070 --> 00:41:48,530
(This is the consequence
of gambling.)

1273
00:41:48,530 --> 00:41:51,070
- Why did you do that?
- Why did you do that?

1274
00:41:51,170 --> 00:41:52,400
With a gae, we would have
caught the green piece.

1275
00:41:52,400 --> 00:41:55,210
- They would have caught us.
- Why did you do that?

1276
00:41:55,300 --> 00:41:56,650
Can you shred this?

1277
00:41:57,010 --> 00:41:58,880
- Seriously.
- Please.

1278
00:41:58,880 --> 00:42:00,920
- We shouldn't have this.
- Gambling is a scary thing.

1279
00:42:00,920 --> 00:42:01,980
(Gambling Addiction Hotline: 1336)

1280
00:42:02,480 --> 00:42:04,440
- Destroy it.
- No.

1281
00:42:04,440 --> 00:42:06,050
(They have second thoughts.)

1282
00:42:06,050 --> 00:42:07,420
(They put it high up instead.)

1283
00:42:07,420 --> 00:42:08,590
Don't use it.

1284
00:42:08,590 --> 00:42:10,530
(Team Blue has
only one meal ticket left.)

1285
00:42:10,530 --> 00:42:11,860
It'd be perfect
if we land on paradise.

1286
00:42:12,030 --> 00:42:13,150
Let's do this, guys.

1287
00:42:13,420 --> 00:42:15,400
We need a do, yut, or mo.

1288
00:42:15,530 --> 00:42:16,960
We have three options.

1289
00:42:17,670 --> 00:42:19,230
(Their goal is to throw a do.)

1290
00:42:21,590 --> 00:42:24,030
(They get a do.)

1291
00:42:24,530 --> 00:42:26,710
(They can't believe
they really threw a do.)

1292
00:42:27,400 --> 00:42:30,210
(They move their piece
onto paradise.)

1293
00:42:30,380 --> 00:42:31,800
- Turn around, everyone.
- Okay.

1294
00:42:32,570 --> 00:42:36,550
They threw a do
and landed on paradise.

1295
00:42:36,550 --> 00:42:38,280
(They got a do?)

1296
00:42:38,280 --> 00:42:39,420
We have to object.

1297
00:42:40,320 --> 00:42:41,690
- Get the sign.
- We have to object.

1298
00:42:41,960 --> 00:42:44,360
- Get the sign!
- Let's do this!

1299
00:42:44,690 --> 00:42:46,130
- We object to this.
- It's impossible.

1300
00:42:46,230 --> 00:42:48,530
- Are you kidding us?
- We're going to risk it.

1301
00:42:48,630 --> 00:42:50,670
- They went too far.
- It's a lie.

1302
00:42:50,900 --> 00:42:53,230
- We're calling them out.
- This is unacceptable.

1303
00:42:53,670 --> 00:42:55,710
- They went way too far.
- It's impossible.

1304
00:42:55,800 --> 00:42:57,840
- It's a lie.
- We're objecting to this.

1305
00:42:58,070 --> 00:42:59,280
It was...

1306
00:42:59,630 --> 00:43:00,800
true.

1307
00:43:01,840 --> 00:43:03,050
- Darn it!
- Darn it!

1308
00:43:03,880 --> 00:43:05,670
(They lose all
of their meal tickets.)

1309
00:43:05,670 --> 00:43:06,840
- Shred it!
- Please shred it.

1310
00:43:06,840 --> 00:43:07,920
(They don't want the sign.)

1311
00:43:07,920 --> 00:43:09,590
(Shredded)

1312
00:43:10,710 --> 00:43:12,610
(Celebrating)

1313
00:43:13,090 --> 00:43:14,960
You guys are broke now.

1314
00:43:14,980 --> 00:43:17,260
- They can't resist it.
- Unbelievable.

1315
00:43:17,380 --> 00:43:18,650
These guys...

1316
00:43:19,090 --> 00:43:21,530
Can we take a loan?
Loan us some meal tickets.

1317
00:43:21,530 --> 00:43:22,800
You'll be getting
penalty badges now.

1318
00:43:22,800 --> 00:43:25,030
Let us visit a nearby pawnshop
for a moment.

1319
00:43:25,030 --> 00:43:26,460
(They'd go on all night.)

1320
00:43:26,460 --> 00:43:27,690
We can do this. We can overcome it.

1321
00:43:27,690 --> 00:43:30,760
Let's change the rule.
Bring one piece home to win.

1322
00:43:31,170 --> 00:43:32,300
We'll overcome it.

1323
00:43:32,300 --> 00:43:33,530
If we get a gae, we can catch them.

1324
00:43:33,530 --> 00:43:35,340
- It's easy to get a gae.
- A gae?

1325
00:43:35,340 --> 00:43:37,170
- You haven't thrown yet, right?
- Us?

1326
00:43:37,170 --> 00:43:39,210
- I have.
- We all have.

1327
00:43:39,210 --> 00:43:40,880
- Someone lucky should do it.
- You do it.

1328
00:43:40,880 --> 00:43:42,320
- No.
- No.

1329
00:43:42,320 --> 00:43:44,090
Hyejeong would throw a yut or a mo.

1330
00:43:44,090 --> 00:43:45,150
- You'd throw a gae.
- Okay.

1331
00:43:46,320 --> 00:43:47,590
(You'd get a gae.)

1332
00:43:47,650 --> 00:43:48,690
- You're perfect.
- Okay.

1333
00:43:48,690 --> 00:43:51,050
- I'd throw a gae?
- He'd get a gae.

1334
00:43:51,130 --> 00:43:52,130
I'd get a gae.

1335
00:43:52,130 --> 00:43:53,800
- Take it easy.
- I'm a gae hunter.

1336
00:43:53,860 --> 00:43:55,090
Take it easy. You can do this!

1337
00:43:55,190 --> 00:43:56,900
- We need a gae.
- Relax.

1338
00:43:56,900 --> 00:43:59,170
(What did the gae hunter toss?)

1339
00:43:59,800 --> 00:44:01,730
(What?)

1340
00:44:01,730 --> 00:44:03,010
What's this?

1341
00:44:03,110 --> 00:44:05,010
- What did he do?
- I'm sure.

1342
00:44:05,010 --> 00:44:06,300
Turn around.

1343
00:44:06,300 --> 00:44:08,010
- They probably caught it.
- They caught it?

1344
00:44:08,010 --> 00:44:09,510
- No.
- No, they didn't.

1345
00:44:09,510 --> 00:44:10,550
(The red piece...)

1346
00:44:10,550 --> 00:44:12,320
(has advanced five steps.)

1347
00:44:12,320 --> 00:44:15,110
They got a mo
and advanced five steps.

1348
00:44:15,380 --> 00:44:17,510
- What did they get?
- They threw a mo.

1349
00:44:17,510 --> 00:44:18,820
- They threw a mo.
- They threw a mo.

1350
00:44:18,980 --> 00:44:20,360
- It's a trick.
- It's a trick.

1351
00:44:20,360 --> 00:44:21,760
- It's definitely a trick.
- It's a trick.

1352
00:44:21,820 --> 00:44:23,730
- They didn't get a gae.
- It's impossible.

1353
00:44:23,730 --> 00:44:26,130
If you're not using it,
please let me borrow it.

1354
00:44:26,230 --> 00:44:27,360
- We call "trick."
- "Trick".

1355
00:44:27,420 --> 00:44:29,070
- I mean...
- It's impossible.

1356
00:44:29,070 --> 00:44:30,300
They threw a mo
and advanced five steps?

1357
00:44:30,420 --> 00:44:32,070
- We got a mo.
- Come on.

1358
00:44:32,070 --> 00:44:34,030
- Who are you trying to fool?
- It's a trick.

1359
00:44:34,030 --> 00:44:35,730
- You thought we wouldn't object.
- It's a trick.

1360
00:44:35,730 --> 00:44:37,730
- You thought we wouldn't.
- Exactly.

1361
00:44:37,730 --> 00:44:38,940
Do you want the chance?
I'm serious this time.

1362
00:44:38,940 --> 00:44:40,780
- We were disappointed.
- Do you want it?

1363
00:44:41,440 --> 00:44:42,550
Jae Suk threw the sticks.

1364
00:44:42,550 --> 00:44:44,340
- Jae Suk did?
- He did...

1365
00:44:44,340 --> 00:44:45,420
and got a mo.

1366
00:44:45,480 --> 00:44:46,840
- I...
- We have to object.

1367
00:44:47,010 --> 00:44:48,210
I threw a mo.

1368
00:44:48,550 --> 00:44:49,610
It's a trick.

1369
00:44:49,610 --> 00:44:50,710
If it really is a trick,

1370
00:44:50,710 --> 00:44:53,150
- you'll move to their position.
- We'll move to their position?

1371
00:44:53,150 --> 00:44:54,880
- Fine, let's do it.
- Let's do it.

1372
00:44:55,050 --> 00:44:56,130
- Let's do it.
- We have nothing to lose.

1373
00:44:56,130 --> 00:44:57,320
We have nothing to lose anyway.

1374
00:44:57,460 --> 00:44:59,230
- Let's do it.
- Let's do it.

1375
00:44:59,230 --> 00:45:01,260
- We have to catch them once.
- Let's go.

1376
00:45:02,300 --> 00:45:03,960
- "Trick!"
- It was...

1377
00:45:04,630 --> 00:45:06,440
(Was it true or false?)

1378
00:45:06,440 --> 00:45:08,670
- true.
- It's true!

1379
00:45:09,210 --> 00:45:11,260
(Jae Suk did get a mo.)

1380
00:45:11,260 --> 00:45:14,730
- It's true?
- It's true!

1381
00:45:14,780 --> 00:45:16,840
(Team Blue gets a penalty badge.)

1382
00:45:16,940 --> 00:45:18,610
We'll decide later.

1383
00:45:18,820 --> 00:45:19,880
Let's finish.

1384
00:45:19,880 --> 00:45:21,670
- Anything but a do is fine.
- Anything but a do is fine.

1385
00:45:21,670 --> 00:45:23,250
We might get a do or a back-do.

1386
00:45:23,250 --> 00:45:24,320
There's a chance.

1387
00:45:24,420 --> 00:45:25,590
- Take it easy.
- Relax.

1388
00:45:25,590 --> 00:45:26,690
(They need to avoid
a do or a back-do.)

1389
00:45:29,460 --> 00:45:31,730
(It's a do.)

1390
00:45:32,650 --> 00:45:34,420
(Unfortunately, they get a do.)

1391
00:45:34,420 --> 00:45:35,690
It's so quiet.

1392
00:45:37,070 --> 00:45:38,300
- Did they get a do?
- In any case,

1393
00:45:38,300 --> 00:45:39,530
there's no winner yet.

1394
00:45:39,530 --> 00:45:40,860
- Please turn around.
- The game didn't end.

1395
00:45:40,860 --> 00:45:42,130
- My goodness.
- This team claims...

1396
00:45:42,130 --> 00:45:44,300
- they threw a do.
- I can't believe it.

1397
00:45:44,300 --> 00:45:46,670
(They stayed honest
and advanced one step.)

1398
00:45:47,710 --> 00:45:49,300
So what happened?

1399
00:45:49,300 --> 00:45:50,750
- They are at the starting point.
- The starting point.

1400
00:45:50,750 --> 00:45:52,110
- We got a do.
- Okay.

1401
00:45:52,110 --> 00:45:53,210
It's plausible.

1402
00:45:53,210 --> 00:45:54,440
Let them off.

1403
00:45:54,440 --> 00:45:56,320
- Let them off. Let's move on.
- Excuse me?

1404
00:45:56,320 --> 00:45:58,860
(The tiger moths decide
to let them off.)

1405
00:45:59,150 --> 00:46:00,380
- Excuse me?
- We really got a do.

1406
00:46:00,380 --> 00:46:02,050
We really got a do.

1407
00:46:02,050 --> 00:46:03,860
Don't do that again.

1408
00:46:04,050 --> 00:46:05,130
I know you will say
you really got it, but...

1409
00:46:05,130 --> 00:46:07,300
They might have gotten a back-do,
but we have no reason...

1410
00:46:07,300 --> 00:46:09,030
- to say they are lying.
- Let's focus on ourselves.

1411
00:46:09,030 --> 00:46:10,230
- Let's go.
- Let's focus on ourselves.

1412
00:46:10,320 --> 00:46:12,300
If we throw a yut,
we will catch their piece.

1413
00:46:12,300 --> 00:46:14,190
If we get a mo, we will get out.

1414
00:46:14,800 --> 00:46:17,210
(Jong Kook throws the yut sticks
and gets...)

1415
00:46:17,210 --> 00:46:19,400
(a geol.)

1416
00:46:20,400 --> 00:46:22,800
(They honestly advance three steps
and neither team objects.)

1417
00:46:22,800 --> 00:46:23,840
We are done.

1418
00:46:24,210 --> 00:46:26,010
You didn't get a yut or a mo, right?
Did you get a geol?

1419
00:46:26,570 --> 00:46:28,170
- Then it must be true.
- They didn't play a trick.

1420
00:46:28,170 --> 00:46:29,590
Team Blue, toss the sticks.

1421
00:46:30,150 --> 00:46:32,980
(Kwang Soo unfolds something.)

1422
00:46:32,980 --> 00:46:35,280
(It reads,)

1423
00:46:35,280 --> 00:46:39,230
("Please react
as if we got a mo or a yut.")

1424
00:46:39,230 --> 00:46:40,820
(They ask the staff to lie.)

1425
00:46:40,820 --> 00:46:43,130
This is meaningless.
That team doesn't scare me at all.

1426
00:46:43,590 --> 00:46:45,400
- Here we go.
- Okay. Let's go.

1427
00:46:45,630 --> 00:46:46,760
Good luck.

1428
00:46:46,760 --> 00:46:48,070
(I believe in you, staff.)

1429
00:46:50,960 --> 00:46:52,730
(Gae)

1430
00:46:55,110 --> 00:46:56,840
(So Min asks for a false reaction.)

1431
00:46:58,340 --> 00:47:00,320
(Silent)

1432
00:47:01,780 --> 00:47:04,210
(I can't believe
this lousy production crew.)

1433
00:47:04,210 --> 00:47:07,150
(We asked you for a favor!)

1434
00:47:07,710 --> 00:47:09,760
(Why won't you react?)

1435
00:47:09,760 --> 00:47:11,320
(Didn't you read this?)

1436
00:47:11,320 --> 00:47:13,320
(Why won't you react?)

1437
00:47:13,460 --> 00:47:16,070
- Everyone is laughing.
- Seriously.

1438
00:47:16,070 --> 00:47:17,900
- Did they get a back-do?
- A back-do...

1439
00:47:17,900 --> 00:47:19,900
or a do.

1440
00:47:20,940 --> 00:47:22,570
- We're throwing the yut-sticks.
- Let's go.

1441
00:47:22,570 --> 00:47:23,730
- We will do it now.
- You already did!

1442
00:47:23,730 --> 00:47:25,440
- No, we didn't.
- Let's go.

1443
00:47:25,630 --> 00:47:27,340
(They are the rule-breakers.)

1444
00:47:27,800 --> 00:47:29,570
(They ask for a reaction.)

1445
00:47:31,440 --> 00:47:33,420
(The nice staff members cheer.)

1446
00:47:33,480 --> 00:47:34,650
My goodness.

1447
00:47:34,650 --> 00:47:36,690
- This is incredible.
- This is insane.

1448
00:47:36,690 --> 00:47:37,920
- All right.
- What did they throw?

1449
00:47:37,920 --> 00:47:38,960
(How many steps will they advance?)

1450
00:47:38,960 --> 00:47:40,710
Please turn around.

1451
00:47:40,710 --> 00:47:41,820
Did you get a mo?

1452
00:47:42,190 --> 00:47:43,230
- Mo?
- You are ridiculous.

1453
00:47:43,230 --> 00:47:44,650
We can't do anything about it.

1454
00:47:45,280 --> 00:47:46,920
They are going all in.

1455
00:47:47,690 --> 00:47:48,730
They are going all in.

1456
00:47:48,730 --> 00:47:50,170
If I were a member of this team,

1457
00:47:50,170 --> 00:47:51,730
I would lie...

1458
00:47:51,730 --> 00:47:53,000
since this is the last chance.

1459
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:54,960
Suk Jin, let's see what they get
the second time.

1460
00:47:54,960 --> 00:47:56,130
- Let them go again.
- Okay.

1461
00:47:56,130 --> 00:47:57,360
Let's see what they get
the second time.

1462
00:47:57,360 --> 00:47:58,800
This time, it was a lie.

1463
00:47:58,800 --> 00:48:00,070
Okay!

1464
00:48:00,170 --> 00:48:01,510
It's meaningless.

1465
00:48:01,510 --> 00:48:02,570
It's okay.

1466
00:48:02,570 --> 00:48:04,710
Hey, don't say it's meaningless!
It's meaningful!

1467
00:48:04,710 --> 00:48:05,920
(Annoyed)

1468
00:48:05,920 --> 00:48:07,050
(Emotional)

1469
00:48:07,050 --> 00:48:08,070
- We can do this!
- It's meaningful.

1470
00:48:08,070 --> 00:48:09,280
We can do this!

1471
00:48:09,280 --> 00:48:12,050
It's not over until it is!

1472
00:48:12,050 --> 00:48:13,420
- Toss the sticks carefully.
- Seriously.

1473
00:48:13,610 --> 00:48:15,110
Please turn around.

1474
00:48:15,110 --> 00:48:16,420
Stay calm.

1475
00:48:17,460 --> 00:48:19,050
(Kwang Soo comes up to the front.)

1476
00:48:19,050 --> 00:48:20,050
We will throw the sticks.

1477
00:48:20,760 --> 00:48:22,760
(He begins to write
something down again.)

1478
00:48:23,690 --> 00:48:25,940
(What will he write this time?)

1479
00:48:26,670 --> 00:48:29,570
(This time, Kwang Soo asks...)

1480
00:48:29,570 --> 00:48:32,610
(the staff members to react
as if they threw a do.)

1481
00:48:33,440 --> 00:48:35,280
(I am begging you.)

1482
00:48:35,610 --> 00:48:36,880
Please throw the yut-sticks.

1483
00:48:36,880 --> 00:48:37,940
(What are they playing at?)

1484
00:48:38,150 --> 00:48:39,170
Two.

1485
00:48:40,670 --> 00:48:43,440
(They got a mo!)

1486
00:48:44,190 --> 00:48:46,280
(It's a miracle.)

1487
00:48:47,480 --> 00:48:50,190
(They can't believe they got a mo.)

1488
00:48:51,780 --> 00:48:53,630
(This time,
the reaction is authentic.)

1489
00:48:53,630 --> 00:48:55,090
- Did they get a good one?
- It's a trick.

1490
00:48:55,090 --> 00:48:56,920
- It's a lie.
- I am 100 percent certain.

1491
00:48:56,920 --> 00:48:59,340
- Hey, don't help them.
- What was that?

1492
00:48:59,340 --> 00:49:01,590
- Don't be like that.
- Don't react.

1493
00:49:01,590 --> 00:49:03,730
- What was that?
- They stayed silent at first.

1494
00:49:03,730 --> 00:49:05,030
They stayed silent at first.

1495
00:49:05,030 --> 00:49:07,070
(We are so happy.)

1496
00:49:07,070 --> 00:49:08,730
(Good job, Jimin!)

1497
00:49:09,010 --> 00:49:10,170
It's a lie.

1498
00:49:10,170 --> 00:49:11,340
(They are certain it's a lie.)

1499
00:49:11,340 --> 00:49:12,650
It's a lie. We caught them.

1500
00:49:13,650 --> 00:49:14,940
It was so obvious this time.

1501
00:49:14,940 --> 00:49:16,420
Turn around.

1502
00:49:16,690 --> 00:49:19,710
This team claims they threw a do
and advanced to there.

1503
00:49:19,710 --> 00:49:20,710
- "Trick!"
- "Trick!"

1504
00:49:20,980 --> 00:49:22,650
(This team claims they threw a do
and advanced to there.)

1505
00:49:22,650 --> 00:49:24,420
(Trick!)

1506
00:49:24,420 --> 00:49:25,730
- It's a lie.
- We are 100 percent certain.

1507
00:49:26,190 --> 00:49:27,960
- It's a trick.
- If you are right,

1508
00:49:27,960 --> 00:49:29,400
it will be over for Team Blue.

1509
00:49:29,400 --> 00:49:30,690
- Okay.
- We are 100 percent certain.

1510
00:49:30,690 --> 00:49:32,460
It was true.

1511
00:49:32,460 --> 00:49:34,440
(It was true!)

1512
00:49:34,690 --> 00:49:35,760
It was true.

1513
00:49:35,760 --> 00:49:36,760
(Sad)

1514
00:49:37,030 --> 00:49:39,130
(Happy)

1515
00:49:41,300 --> 00:49:43,780
- It was true?
- We will lose the other piece.

1516
00:49:44,010 --> 00:49:46,610
- We have two pieces.
- We can lose this piece.

1517
00:49:47,670 --> 00:49:49,480
- Yes!
- I love you guys!

1518
00:49:49,780 --> 00:49:51,710
- We can do this!
- We can do this!

1519
00:49:51,940 --> 00:49:53,760
It's not over until it is!

1520
00:49:53,760 --> 00:49:55,960
- "One-Eyed..."
- "Jacks!"

1521
00:49:55,960 --> 00:49:56,960
(In tears)

1522
00:49:56,960 --> 00:49:58,360
We are going next.

1523
00:49:58,480 --> 00:50:00,260
- We are going next.
- It's okay.

1524
00:50:00,260 --> 00:50:02,300
- But if they...
- If they get a mo again...

1525
00:50:02,300 --> 00:50:03,730
- Seriously.
- If they get a mo or a yut,

1526
00:50:03,730 --> 00:50:04,860
- we would lose.
- That won't happen.

1527
00:50:04,860 --> 00:50:06,090
- That won't happen.
- Let's call out their lie...

1528
00:50:06,090 --> 00:50:07,340
even if they are in last place.

1529
00:50:07,340 --> 00:50:09,070
- I am so annoyed.
- Okay.

1530
00:50:09,230 --> 00:50:12,030
- A yut will put it in the fire pit.
- A yut will put it in the fire pit.

1531
00:50:12,230 --> 00:50:13,530
If we get a yut,

1532
00:50:13,530 --> 00:50:14,710
we will start a new piece.

1533
00:50:14,710 --> 00:50:16,510
- That's right.
- We won't get a yut.

1534
00:50:16,710 --> 00:50:18,050
- Come on.
- Let's see how it goes.

1535
00:50:18,050 --> 00:50:19,570
If we lose at this point...

1536
00:50:19,670 --> 00:50:22,070
- I can't believe it.
- How did that happen?

1537
00:50:22,250 --> 00:50:24,480
We have to do well.
This is our last chance.

1538
00:50:24,480 --> 00:50:26,880
I will give you my spirits.

1539
00:50:31,030 --> 00:50:33,090
(Cheering)

1540
00:50:33,090 --> 00:50:34,590
(No way.)

1541
00:50:34,650 --> 00:50:37,130
Their reaction was late.

1542
00:50:37,920 --> 00:50:39,570
I should have made
that piece take an exit.

1543
00:50:39,570 --> 00:50:41,090
- You shouldn't have gotten a do.
- All right.

1544
00:50:41,090 --> 00:50:42,440
- Turn around.
- Seriously.

1545
00:50:42,440 --> 00:50:44,170
- What?
- They claim they got a yut...

1546
00:50:44,170 --> 00:50:46,170
- and advanced a new piece.
- Okay.

1547
00:50:46,880 --> 00:50:49,250
(Could it be true?)

1548
00:50:50,340 --> 00:50:51,710
A new piece?

1549
00:50:51,710 --> 00:50:53,150
I think it's true.

1550
00:50:53,610 --> 00:50:56,210
This lets them take another turn.

1551
00:50:56,210 --> 00:50:57,650
Oh, you are right.

1552
00:50:58,380 --> 00:51:00,550
(Is it a ploy to have another turn?)

1553
00:51:00,550 --> 00:51:02,050
- That's right.
- Let's call them out.

1554
00:51:02,050 --> 00:51:03,360
- Let's call them out.
- No, no.

1555
00:51:03,360 --> 00:51:04,960
- No, no.
- Hold on.

1556
00:51:05,150 --> 00:51:07,260
- It's their only chance to win.
- No, no.

1557
00:51:07,920 --> 00:51:10,590
It's their only chance to win.

1558
00:51:10,590 --> 00:51:12,260
There is no way
they got a yut after a mo.

1559
00:51:12,260 --> 00:51:13,300
- 10...
- No, no.

1560
00:51:13,300 --> 00:51:14,460
They advanced a new piece
to avoid the fire pit.

1561
00:51:14,670 --> 00:51:15,760
Nine.

1562
00:51:15,760 --> 00:51:18,460
If we take a chance, we could win.

1563
00:51:19,610 --> 00:51:21,010
They advanced a new piece
to avoid the fire pit.

1564
00:51:21,480 --> 00:51:23,010
- We need to call them out.
- I don't think...

1565
00:51:23,010 --> 00:51:24,650
- I don't think we should.
- Eight.

1566
00:51:24,650 --> 00:51:25,780
(If Team Blue is lying,)

1567
00:51:25,780 --> 00:51:26,880
(the team that calls them out 1st
will win.)

1568
00:51:26,880 --> 00:51:28,980
(But if they are not,
calling them out will cost a piece.)

1569
00:51:28,980 --> 00:51:30,840
- "Trick!"
- It isn't.

1570
00:51:30,840 --> 00:51:33,550
(Team Red shouted it out first.)

1571
00:51:33,550 --> 00:51:34,920
We are taking a risk.

1572
00:51:34,920 --> 00:51:36,690
- We are taking a risk.
- We have to take a risk.

1573
00:51:36,690 --> 00:51:38,550
- Otherwise, they would win.
- That's right.

1574
00:51:38,630 --> 00:51:40,090
It was...

1575
00:51:40,090 --> 00:51:41,550
We will give you one more chance.

1576
00:51:41,650 --> 00:51:42,730
- No.
- They are lying.

1577
00:51:42,730 --> 00:51:45,940
(Is it the truth or a trick?)

1578
00:51:46,090 --> 00:51:48,360
- It was...
- A trick.

1579
00:51:48,860 --> 00:51:51,070
(This is the objection
that will decide the winner.)

1580
00:51:51,070 --> 00:51:52,130
A trick.

1581
00:51:53,610 --> 00:51:54,730
A trick.

1582
00:51:54,730 --> 00:51:55,780
(Team Blue got a gae,
but acted like they got a yut.)

1583
00:51:55,780 --> 00:51:57,070
I knew it.

1584
00:51:57,070 --> 00:51:59,880
Jong Kook, had you stayed quiet,
we would have gone down.

1585
00:51:59,980 --> 00:52:01,920
- You gave us a hint.
- A hint about another turn.

1586
00:52:01,920 --> 00:52:02,980
(We should have objected.)

1587
00:52:02,980 --> 00:52:04,280
Nice! We placed first!

1588
00:52:04,280 --> 00:52:06,280
- Thank you.
- We got them.

1589
00:52:06,280 --> 00:52:07,460
Thank you.

1590
00:52:07,460 --> 00:52:09,360
(Team Red places 1st!)

1591
00:52:09,360 --> 00:52:10,630
We got them.

1592
00:52:11,420 --> 00:52:12,460
That was incredible.

1593
00:52:12,460 --> 00:52:14,760
- It's our turn to throw the sticks.
- It will end the game.

1594
00:52:15,260 --> 00:52:16,320
They could get a back-do.

1595
00:52:16,320 --> 00:52:17,690
- They could get a back-do.
- That's right.

1596
00:52:17,690 --> 00:52:19,440
If miracles exist,
they will get a back-do.

1597
00:52:19,440 --> 00:52:21,130
Even if we get a do,

1598
00:52:21,130 --> 00:52:22,570
- the game won't end.
- A do won't do.

1599
00:52:22,570 --> 00:52:24,170
We would get stuck on the last step.

1600
00:52:24,340 --> 00:52:25,570
Please.

1601
00:52:25,570 --> 00:52:27,300
It was cool. It was a miracle...

1602
00:52:27,300 --> 00:52:29,070
- when you threw that mo, Jimin.
- Seriously.

1603
00:52:29,210 --> 00:52:30,780
- It was cool.
- I was so surprised.

1604
00:52:30,780 --> 00:52:33,340
(Let's get a gae
or something better.)

1605
00:52:34,880 --> 00:52:36,280
- We are done.
- All right.

1606
00:52:36,980 --> 00:52:38,150
Turn around.

1607
00:52:38,420 --> 00:52:40,480
(It seems like the game is over.)

1608
00:52:40,480 --> 00:52:42,090
- We are done.
- We are done.

1609
00:52:42,260 --> 00:52:43,780
I think...

1610
00:52:43,780 --> 00:52:45,050
- I think...
- What did they get?

1611
00:52:45,050 --> 00:52:46,460
- they got a do.
- What did they get?

1612
00:52:46,460 --> 00:52:48,590
They claim they got something better
than a do and took an exit.

1613
00:52:48,590 --> 00:52:50,500
Had they gotten a do,
they wouldn't have taken an exit.

1614
00:52:50,590 --> 00:52:51,800
This is our last chance.

1615
00:52:51,800 --> 00:52:53,730
- It's a trick.
- Let's go. "Trick!"

1616
00:52:53,730 --> 00:52:55,570
- We have to object. Do you agree?
- It's a trick.

1617
00:52:55,630 --> 00:52:57,800
- We have to object.
- You could get a penalty badge.

1618
00:52:57,800 --> 00:52:58,800
Give us a penalty badge!

1619
00:52:58,900 --> 00:53:00,400
They are irredeemable.

1620
00:53:00,480 --> 00:53:01,980
We have to object.

1621
00:53:02,280 --> 00:53:04,050
- It's your call.
- It was...

1622
00:53:04,050 --> 00:53:07,780
(The last objection will decide
which team places 2nd.)

1623
00:53:15,270 --> 00:53:16,770
(Was it the truth or a lie?)

1624
00:53:16,810 --> 00:53:17,870
It was...

1625
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:19,370
a trick.

1626
00:53:19,370 --> 00:53:21,100
(Trick!)

1627
00:53:22,370 --> 00:53:25,040
(They are overjoyed.)

1628
00:53:25,040 --> 00:53:28,720
(What did Team Green get
to use a trick?)

1629
00:53:29,540 --> 00:53:31,990
(Seolhyun threw the yut-sticks.)

1630
00:53:34,080 --> 00:53:37,020
(A back-do)

1631
00:53:37,500 --> 00:53:38,890
(For goodness' sake!)

1632
00:53:39,600 --> 00:53:42,600
(How could this happen?)

1633
00:53:43,560 --> 00:53:46,620
(They had to use a trick
to avoid the fire pit.)

1634
00:53:46,620 --> 00:53:47,040
- We got a back-do.
- A back-do.
(They had to use a trick
to avoid the fire pit.)

1635
00:53:47,040 --> 00:53:48,640
- We got a back-do.
- A back-do.

1636
00:53:48,640 --> 00:53:49,850
Did you get a back-do?

1637
00:53:50,320 --> 00:53:51,950
That would have put the piece
on the fire pit.

1638
00:53:51,950 --> 00:53:53,530
That was unbelievable.

1639
00:53:53,530 --> 00:53:54,930
That was insane. That was insane.

1640
00:53:54,930 --> 00:53:56,550
It was a miracle.

1641
00:53:56,550 --> 00:53:58,700
- See?
- A miracle occurred.

1642
00:53:58,700 --> 00:54:00,100
- Seriously.
- A miracle occurred.

1643
00:54:00,100 --> 00:54:02,330
Thus, the winner is...

1644
00:54:02,330 --> 00:54:03,830
We are so cool.

1645
00:54:03,990 --> 00:54:05,300
We are so cool.

1646
00:54:05,300 --> 00:54:06,700
(Team Red got 15 meal tickets,)

1647
00:54:06,700 --> 00:54:08,260
(Team Blue got 5 meal tickets
and 3 penalty badges,)

1648
00:54:08,260 --> 00:54:09,740
(and Team Green got 4 meal tickets
and 2 penalty badges.)

1649
00:54:09,740 --> 00:54:12,410
- Thank you for the food.
- Thank you for the food.

1650
00:54:12,870 --> 00:54:14,780
That team is having a feast.

1651
00:54:14,780 --> 00:54:15,910
- Of course.
- It's so tasty.

1652
00:54:15,910 --> 00:54:17,850
- We placed first.
- I wish I could give you some.

1653
00:54:18,580 --> 00:54:19,680
I'm so jealous.

1654
00:54:19,680 --> 00:54:21,010
(Jjajangmyeon after a good match
tastes incredible.)

1655
00:54:21,720 --> 00:54:23,990
(Seolhyun has a spoonful
of jjamppong soup.)

1656
00:54:23,990 --> 00:54:25,010
(It's so tasty.)

1657
00:54:25,010 --> 00:54:26,580
How is it? Is it good?

1658
00:54:27,390 --> 00:54:29,530
- Seolhyun, is it good?
- Yes.

1659
00:54:29,530 --> 00:54:31,990
How did you get a back-do
in that critical moment?

1660
00:54:33,160 --> 00:54:35,390
(He holds grudges.)

1661
00:54:35,970 --> 00:54:37,300
I don't know.

1662
00:54:37,300 --> 00:54:39,030
I can't believe you got a back-do.

1663
00:54:39,800 --> 00:54:43,530
Seolhyun, he is being nice
because it's you.

1664
00:54:43,530 --> 00:54:45,640
If it was Haha or one of us,
he wouldn't have sat still.

1665
00:54:45,640 --> 00:54:47,280
Had Haha done it,

1666
00:54:47,450 --> 00:54:49,010
I would have held grudges
for two weeks.

1667
00:54:49,510 --> 00:54:50,680
Is he still mad at Haha?

1668
00:54:50,680 --> 00:54:52,050
- Is he?
- Is he still mad at Haha?

1669
00:54:52,050 --> 00:54:53,240
Yondu?

1670
00:54:53,390 --> 00:54:54,740
Be quiet.

1671
00:54:55,550 --> 00:54:59,180
(The meal ends on a pleasant note.)

1672
00:54:59,220 --> 00:55:00,930
Is that crunchy fried chicken?

1673
00:55:00,930 --> 00:55:02,760
- It looks delicious.
- It's chicken!

1674
00:55:02,760 --> 00:55:04,600
Incheon is well-known
for its crunchy fried chicken.

1675
00:55:04,600 --> 00:55:05,930
I really want egg bread.

1676
00:55:05,930 --> 00:55:08,100
- I want this.
- I want this.

1677
00:55:08,100 --> 00:55:10,070
- I want this.
- What's jjajang bingsu?

1678
00:55:10,160 --> 00:55:12,200
- I want egg bread.
- Is that bingsu?

1679
00:55:12,200 --> 00:55:14,160
I guess that's ice cream.

1680
00:55:14,160 --> 00:55:16,680
It looks like jjajangmyeon,
but it's ice cream.

1681
00:55:16,680 --> 00:55:18,740
The prizes on this mission...

1682
00:55:18,740 --> 00:55:20,740
are the desserts
that represent Incheon.

1683
00:55:20,740 --> 00:55:24,180
The second mission is
Come and Find Me Like a Cat.

1684
00:55:24,180 --> 00:55:25,470
(The second mission,
Come and Find Me Like a Cat)

1685
00:55:25,470 --> 00:55:27,950
Come and Find Me Like a Cat.

1686
00:55:27,950 --> 00:55:29,390
(They like the name.)

1687
00:55:29,890 --> 00:55:33,450
This game will be played
while the train goes around once.

1688
00:55:33,450 --> 00:55:35,850
Pick one person as an attacker
on your team,

1689
00:55:35,930 --> 00:55:37,930
and we'll take turns attacking.

1690
00:55:37,930 --> 00:55:39,970
Everybody
but the person attacking...

1691
00:55:39,970 --> 00:55:42,470
has to run away
in the designated train.

1692
00:55:42,470 --> 00:55:43,470
(Everybody but the attacker
has to run away in the train.)

1693
00:55:43,570 --> 00:55:45,930
The attacker wears the blindfold,

1694
00:55:45,930 --> 00:55:49,030
- and uses this plush toy.
- That sounds fun.

1695
00:55:49,030 --> 00:55:50,870
If you hit your opponents,
you earn a point.

1696
00:55:50,870 --> 00:55:55,240
If you hit your own team or staff,
you lose two points.

1697
00:55:55,240 --> 00:55:56,550
You can't just attack.

1698
00:55:56,550 --> 00:55:58,720
The people running away
can't talk...

1699
00:55:58,720 --> 00:56:01,490
but can make animal sounds.

1700
00:56:01,490 --> 00:56:03,160
Like "woof, woof?"

1701
00:56:03,180 --> 00:56:04,490
- Right.
<i>- Meow</i>

1702
00:56:04,490 --> 00:56:07,280
For example,
if my team is trying to hit me,

1703
00:56:07,330 --> 00:56:10,260
then I can't say your name,
but I can say, "woof, woof"...

1704
00:56:10,260 --> 00:56:12,550
- or "cock-a-doodle-doo."
<i>- Meow</i>

1705
00:56:12,550 --> 00:56:15,930
1st place team gets 10 meal tickets,
2nd place team gets 5,

1706
00:56:15,930 --> 00:56:18,260
- and 3rd place team gets 1.
- This is difficult.

1707
00:56:18,260 --> 00:56:20,200
(Which team will win this game?)

1708
00:56:21,140 --> 00:56:24,200
You can't make any sound
but animal sounds.

1709
00:56:24,370 --> 00:56:26,740
Is it this train
or can we go to the next one?

1710
00:56:26,740 --> 00:56:28,580
- Should we get started?
- It's just this train.

1711
00:56:28,580 --> 00:56:31,080
- It's just this?
- That's so hard.

1712
00:56:31,080 --> 00:56:32,370
(This is too tight for 12 people.)

1713
00:56:32,370 --> 00:56:34,050
- It's small.
- It's so tight.

1714
00:56:34,410 --> 00:56:36,910
- We can't run away here.
- Is it "meow?"

1715
00:56:36,910 --> 00:56:38,950
- Ours is "meow."
- Should we move around?

1716
00:56:38,950 --> 00:56:40,550
You can move around now.

1717
00:56:40,550 --> 00:56:42,490
We have to walk around.

1718
00:56:42,490 --> 00:56:45,220
Team Green, let's stay together.

1719
00:56:45,450 --> 00:56:46,890
We'll get hit together.

1720
00:56:46,890 --> 00:56:48,160
- First team,
- Do we go first?

1721
00:56:48,160 --> 00:56:49,660
please have your attacker come up.

1722
00:56:49,660 --> 00:56:51,160
Put on the blindfold.

1723
00:56:51,160 --> 00:56:53,970
- We have to make a lot of sounds.
<i>- Woof, woof</i>

1724
00:56:53,970 --> 00:56:55,570
I won't go there then.

1725
00:56:55,570 --> 00:56:57,240
Kwang Soo, woof, woof.

1726
00:56:57,870 --> 00:56:59,800
Hey, you can't do that.

1727
00:56:59,800 --> 00:57:01,300
Not here, woof.

1728
00:57:02,240 --> 00:57:04,950
It's a full blindfold
with swim goggles.

1729
00:57:04,950 --> 00:57:07,850
We'll start once I blow the whistle.
Please move around.

1730
00:57:07,850 --> 00:57:09,450
- I don't think he can see at all.
- Right? He can't see.

1731
00:57:09,450 --> 00:57:11,780
- This is the plush toy.
- Ready...

1732
00:57:11,950 --> 00:57:14,950
Ready, set...

1733
00:57:14,950 --> 00:57:17,390
(How many points
will Team Blue earn?)

1734
00:57:18,100 --> 00:57:19,100
(Game starts.)

1735
00:57:19,100 --> 00:57:20,470
Behind you, woof.

1736
00:57:20,470 --> 00:57:23,070
Woof, woof, me.

1737
00:57:23,760 --> 00:57:24,870
<i>Woof</i>

1738
00:57:24,870 --> 00:57:25,870
(Somebody is here.)

1739
00:57:26,390 --> 00:57:28,970
(Chanmi and Jae Suk are
cornered already.)

1740
00:57:30,240 --> 00:57:31,280
<i>Woof, woof</i>

1741
00:57:31,280 --> 00:57:32,530
(Hit them!)

1742
00:57:32,910 --> 00:57:34,010
<i>Woof, woof</i>

1743
00:57:34,010 --> 00:57:35,450
(Hitting)

1744
00:57:35,640 --> 00:57:36,720
<i>Woof!</i>

1745
00:57:36,720 --> 00:57:38,010
(Slapping)

1746
00:57:38,370 --> 00:57:40,010
(He confirms that
it's a guy's voice.)

1747
00:57:40,010 --> 00:57:41,550
(I got you, punk.)

1748
00:57:41,550 --> 00:57:42,640
Kwang Soo.

1749
00:57:42,640 --> 00:57:43,820
(Kwang Soo's knee
is not coming down.)

1750
00:57:43,820 --> 00:57:47,080
Hey.

1751
00:57:47,390 --> 00:57:48,660
Woof, woof, behind you.

1752
00:57:48,660 --> 00:57:49,660
- We'll see about this.
<i>- Woof, woof</i>

1753
00:57:50,050 --> 00:57:51,330
We'll see.

1754
00:57:51,330 --> 00:57:52,330
(Team Blue gains a point
if they get Jae Suk.)

1755
00:57:52,450 --> 00:57:54,760
- They're here, woof.
<i>- Woof!</i>

1756
00:57:55,470 --> 00:57:56,660
<i>- Woof, woof</i>
- Can he see?

1757
00:57:56,660 --> 00:57:58,200
(Kwang Soo loses track.)

1758
00:57:58,200 --> 00:57:59,600
Dong Hoon.

1759
00:57:59,600 --> 00:58:01,070
(I'm So Min.)

1760
00:58:01,410 --> 00:58:03,100
(He approaches So Min
who's barking.)

1761
00:58:03,100 --> 00:58:04,100
(What?)

1762
00:58:04,100 --> 00:58:06,180
(A shoe camera?)

1763
00:58:06,740 --> 00:58:07,950
(Hitting)

1764
00:58:08,350 --> 00:58:10,450
(His body responds
to the smell of the shoe.)

1765
00:58:11,140 --> 00:58:12,870
- Good job.
- Who was it?

1766
00:58:13,280 --> 00:58:14,910
- Se Chan.
- You're going to swing that hard?

1767
00:58:14,910 --> 00:58:16,950
(Is there another person behind?)

1768
00:58:16,950 --> 00:58:18,820
(Hyejeong is about to get caught.)

1769
00:58:19,850 --> 00:58:22,490
(He goes behind the camera
following Haha's voice.)

1770
00:58:23,030 --> 00:58:24,720
(I got you, punk.)

1771
00:58:24,720 --> 00:58:26,350
- Minus two for staff.
- No, no.

1772
00:58:26,350 --> 00:58:28,970
(Director Kang Chan Hee,
oldest staff member of Running Man)

1773
00:58:29,760 --> 00:58:32,330
(He's the 1st celebrity
who hit Producer Kang.)

1774
00:58:32,330 --> 00:58:33,470
Minus two for staff.

1775
00:58:33,470 --> 00:58:35,160
- It's Chan Hee.
- I'm sorry.

1776
00:58:35,160 --> 00:58:37,410
- You hit his cheek.
- I'm sorry.

1777
00:58:37,410 --> 00:58:38,530
I'm sorry, sir!

1778
00:58:38,530 --> 00:58:40,550
- You hit his cheek!
- I'm sorry.

1779
00:58:40,550 --> 00:58:41,800
Last chance.

1780
00:58:42,300 --> 00:58:43,470
<i>- Woof, woof</i>
- So Min.

1781
00:58:43,470 --> 00:58:45,140
- She's on our team. Come here.
- So Min.

1782
00:58:45,820 --> 00:58:48,950
(There's tension in the air
with one chance left.)

1783
00:58:49,240 --> 00:58:51,910
(Their legs shake.)

1784
00:58:52,280 --> 00:58:53,280
Good.

1785
00:58:53,280 --> 00:58:55,330
(Yuna gets away.)

1786
00:58:55,850 --> 00:58:57,600
(He chases after her.)

1787
00:58:58,260 --> 00:58:59,660
(Producer Jung Chul Min)

1788
00:58:59,660 --> 00:59:01,260
(He swings full force.)

1789
00:59:02,160 --> 00:59:03,300
(As soon as he detects movement,)

1790
00:59:03,300 --> 00:59:04,930
(he swings full force.)

1791
00:59:05,660 --> 00:59:08,100
(He attacks the producer too.)

1792
00:59:08,370 --> 00:59:09,370
What was that?

1793
00:59:09,370 --> 00:59:12,140
- It's Chul Min.
- I'm sorry!

1794
00:59:12,140 --> 00:59:14,580
- Who did you think it was?
- I'm sorry.

1795
00:59:14,580 --> 00:59:17,180
I'm really sorry. I had no idea.

1796
00:59:17,280 --> 00:59:18,640
Chul Min!

1797
00:59:19,370 --> 00:59:20,910
- I'm sorry.
- Why would you hit him?

1798
00:59:20,910 --> 00:59:22,410
I'm sorry.

1799
00:59:22,450 --> 00:59:23,950
- Is it over?
- It's over.

1800
00:59:23,950 --> 00:59:25,760
- He grabbed my hair.
- That was so funny.

1801
00:59:25,760 --> 00:59:27,660
(There are other victims.)

1802
00:59:27,760 --> 00:59:28,760
- He grabbed my hair.
- Are you all right?

1803
00:59:28,760 --> 00:59:31,050
- Right? My bad.
- No, it's okay.

1804
00:59:31,050 --> 00:59:33,050
You have to make the animal sounds.

1805
00:59:33,570 --> 00:59:36,330
Team Red, please come up.

1806
00:59:36,330 --> 00:59:37,570
- Se Chan.
- Yes.

1807
00:59:37,570 --> 00:59:39,200
- Direct me.
- Good luck.

1808
00:59:39,200 --> 00:59:40,870
Go forward is "meow."

1809
00:59:40,870 --> 00:59:42,140
"Meow"?

1810
00:59:42,140 --> 00:59:43,970
Go back is "meow!"

1811
00:59:43,970 --> 00:59:45,830
- Is this for everybody?
<i>- "Meow!"</i>

1812
00:59:45,830 --> 00:59:47,140
(Everybody can hear.)

1813
00:59:47,140 --> 00:59:49,280
- Suk Jin.
- Is this for all of us?

1814
00:59:49,280 --> 00:59:50,580
- What are you doing?
- Go forward is "meow."

1815
00:59:50,580 --> 00:59:52,580
- Did you hear him?
- Go forward is "meow."

1816
00:59:52,580 --> 00:59:53,640
Go back is "woof?"

1817
00:59:53,640 --> 00:59:55,640
Go forward is "meow."
Go back is "woof."

1818
00:59:55,640 --> 00:59:56,640
- All right.
<i>- Meow</i>

1819
00:59:57,450 --> 01:00:00,850
I'll communicate
with animal sounds, okay?

1820
01:00:00,850 --> 01:00:01,850
Okay.

1821
01:00:01,850 --> 01:00:03,180
<i>- Woof, woof</i>
- Jae Suk's voice.

1822
01:00:03,180 --> 01:00:04,350
That's go forward.

1823
01:00:04,350 --> 01:00:06,120
<i>No. Kwang Soo</i>

1824
01:00:06,120 --> 01:00:09,200
- He said Kwang Soo.
- Kwang Soo

1825
01:00:09,200 --> 01:00:10,390
(Hold on.)

1826
01:00:10,390 --> 01:00:12,100
- What was that?
- Kwang Soo!

1827
01:00:12,100 --> 01:00:13,660
How does a dog speak?

1828
01:00:13,660 --> 01:00:16,300
- I didn't speak.
- The dog said, "Kwang Soo."

1829
01:00:16,300 --> 01:00:17,510
<i>Kwang Soo!</i>

1830
01:00:17,510 --> 01:00:19,580
- Kwang Soo.
- Do Haha.

1831
01:00:19,580 --> 01:00:21,450
<i>Haha!</i>

1832
01:00:21,450 --> 01:00:23,720
- Only animal sounds count.
- These are animal sounds.

1833
01:00:23,720 --> 01:00:26,140
Look at the sea.

1834
01:00:26,820 --> 01:00:28,010
It's pretty.

1835
01:00:28,720 --> 01:00:29,740
This is nice.

1836
01:00:30,010 --> 01:00:31,580
- This is great.
- This is amazing.

1837
01:00:31,580 --> 01:00:33,680
- Look at that.
- This is so nice.

1838
01:00:34,030 --> 01:00:36,720
- Let's get started. Ready...
<i>- Woof, woof</i>

1839
01:00:36,720 --> 01:00:39,450
(Se Chan is the attacker.
How many points will he earn?)

1840
01:00:41,620 --> 01:00:42,760
Set...

1841
01:00:42,870 --> 01:00:44,600
(Game starts.)

1842
01:00:44,600 --> 01:00:46,140
<i>Woof, woof</i>

1843
01:00:46,930 --> 01:00:50,680
Meow, it's me.

1844
01:00:50,680 --> 01:00:52,800
(Hit him!)

1845
01:00:54,050 --> 01:00:55,180
- Kwang Soo.
<i>- Woof, woof</i>

1846
01:00:55,450 --> 01:00:57,470
(Why is he hanging from there?)

1847
01:00:57,470 --> 01:00:58,470
<i>Woof, woof</i>

1848
01:00:58,470 --> 01:01:00,010
(That's the signal to attack.)

1849
01:01:00,010 --> 01:01:01,320
(Hitting)

1850
01:01:01,850 --> 01:01:02,990
<i>Woof, woof</i>

1851
01:01:03,320 --> 01:01:05,450
(Collapsing)

1852
01:01:06,320 --> 01:01:07,330
What now?

1853
01:01:07,450 --> 01:01:09,330
- Who was it?
- Kwang Soo.

1854
01:01:10,350 --> 01:01:12,850
(What kind of strategy was that?)

1855
01:01:13,330 --> 01:01:14,870
(Oh, my.)

1856
01:01:14,870 --> 01:01:15,930
<i>- Woof, woof
- Woof, woof</i>

1857
01:01:15,930 --> 01:01:17,100
(Se Chan is on a roll
after catching Kwang Soo.)

1858
01:01:17,100 --> 01:01:19,140
(He advances boldly.)

1859
01:01:19,140 --> 01:01:20,870
(Ji Hyo and Jong Kook are
in front of him,)

1860
01:01:20,870 --> 01:01:22,140
(but he gets flung.)

1861
01:01:22,140 --> 01:01:23,370
- No.
<i>- Woof, woof</i>

1862
01:01:23,370 --> 01:01:25,370
(It's us!)

1863
01:01:26,580 --> 01:01:28,640
(Is this an animal sound?)

1864
01:01:28,640 --> 01:01:29,970
Go back!

1865
01:01:29,970 --> 01:01:31,350
(Hitting)

1866
01:01:32,950 --> 01:01:34,350
(I don't know anymore.)

1867
01:01:34,350 --> 01:01:36,120
(Calm down.)

1868
01:01:36,120 --> 01:01:37,120
(He shows no mercy.)

1869
01:01:37,120 --> 01:01:38,120
<i>Meow, meow</i>

1870
01:01:38,490 --> 01:01:40,450
(Be quiet, everybody.)

1871
01:01:40,720 --> 01:01:42,760
Hey.

1872
01:01:42,760 --> 01:01:44,220
- Are you out of your mind?
<i>- Woof, woof</i>

1873
01:01:44,220 --> 01:01:45,600
- Are you out of your mind?
- Goodness.

1874
01:01:45,600 --> 01:01:46,600
(He doesn't care about the strategy
anymore. He just goes for it.)

1875
01:01:46,870 --> 01:01:48,660
(Who's that?)

1876
01:01:49,220 --> 01:01:50,240
<i>- Woof, woof</i>
- Good job.

1877
01:01:50,240 --> 01:01:51,240
(What's he doing?)

1878
01:01:51,240 --> 01:01:52,240
<i>Meow, meow</i>

1879
01:01:52,600 --> 01:01:53,600
That's it.

1880
01:01:53,600 --> 01:01:54,930
That was so funny.

1881
01:01:54,930 --> 01:01:55,970
Do you have a grudge?

1882
01:01:56,240 --> 01:01:58,030
- That was so funny.
- Why?

1883
01:01:58,030 --> 01:02:00,640
- Why did you hit Jae Suk?
- Why did you hit my eye?

1884
01:02:00,640 --> 01:02:02,450
- My bad.
- Why did you hit him?

1885
01:02:02,450 --> 01:02:04,450
I got the animal sounds confused.

1886
01:02:04,450 --> 01:02:06,140
- Goodness.
- Okay.

1887
01:02:06,140 --> 01:02:08,240
- That was so funny.
- Let's get started. Ready...

1888
01:02:08,240 --> 01:02:10,350
(It's Team Green's turn.
Yuna is the attacker.)

1889
01:02:10,350 --> 01:02:11,390
Set...

1890
01:02:11,720 --> 01:02:12,720
(Game starts.)

1891
01:02:12,720 --> 01:02:14,990
I don't know where I am.

1892
01:02:15,580 --> 01:02:17,450
(Her team dashes away.)

1893
01:02:18,550 --> 01:02:19,550
<i>Meow</i>

1894
01:02:19,720 --> 01:02:22,070
(It's us.)

1895
01:02:22,070 --> 01:02:23,220
(What?)

1896
01:02:23,220 --> 01:02:24,760
(We're on the same team.)

1897
01:02:25,470 --> 01:02:26,470
(What?)

1898
01:02:26,470 --> 01:02:28,470
(It's us!)

1899
01:02:28,970 --> 01:02:30,470
(Hit them!)

1900
01:02:31,430 --> 01:02:32,930
(Hitting)

1901
01:02:32,930 --> 01:02:34,350
She hit them.

1902
01:02:34,350 --> 01:02:36,180
(It's obviously Seolhyun's voice.)

1903
01:02:36,180 --> 01:02:37,740
(She swings without hesitation.)

1904
01:02:37,740 --> 01:02:39,820
- Ji Hyo got hit.
- They both got hit.

1905
01:02:39,820 --> 01:02:42,120
- It's minus two points.
- She can't hit us again.

1906
01:02:42,120 --> 01:02:43,850
- She hit her own team, so minus 2.
- Minus 2.

1907
01:02:44,320 --> 01:02:45,320
Oh, gosh.

1908
01:02:46,320 --> 01:02:48,450
(Jong Kook feels threatened,
so he uses force.)

1909
01:02:49,260 --> 01:02:50,330
What?

1910
01:02:51,330 --> 01:02:52,760
(She attacks him.)

1911
01:02:53,300 --> 01:02:54,660
(She eliminates Suk Jin who was
making a weird chimpanzee sound.)

1912
01:02:54,660 --> 01:02:56,490
- Did I get hit?
- Suk Jin is out.

1913
01:02:56,490 --> 01:02:58,740
(She's searching for
her next target.)

1914
01:02:59,240 --> 01:03:00,740
(It's me, Yuna.)

1915
01:03:00,740 --> 01:03:02,600
<i>Woof, woof</i>

1916
01:03:03,030 --> 01:03:04,030
<i>Woof, woof</i>

1917
01:03:06,330 --> 01:03:08,910
(Jong Kook sounded urgent.)

1918
01:03:08,910 --> 01:03:10,740
(She replies with an attack.)

1919
01:03:11,910 --> 01:03:14,740
- You can't hit our team.
<i>- Woof, woof</i>

1920
01:03:14,740 --> 01:03:15,740
He's on our team.

1921
01:03:15,740 --> 01:03:17,660
- Is this over?
- That's it.

1922
01:03:17,660 --> 01:03:19,820
- All right.
- All right.

1923
01:03:19,850 --> 01:03:22,050
This is round two.

1924
01:03:22,050 --> 01:03:23,660
That was round one.

1925
01:03:23,660 --> 01:03:24,930
How many are there?

1926
01:03:24,930 --> 01:03:26,330
- You go.
- This is the last one.

1927
01:03:26,330 --> 01:03:28,120
I'll go this time.
Is it just two rounds?

1928
01:03:28,120 --> 01:03:29,760
- Yes, it's just two.
- Come here.

1929
01:03:29,760 --> 01:03:31,200
Hyejeong, do you want to try?

1930
01:03:31,200 --> 01:03:32,470
- Can you do it?
- Go, Hyejeong.

1931
01:03:32,470 --> 01:03:33,490
- Hyejeong can do it.
- Okay.

1932
01:03:33,490 --> 01:03:36,030
We need signals.

1933
01:03:36,030 --> 01:03:37,600
"Woof" is to hit.

1934
01:03:37,600 --> 01:03:39,080
"Crow" is to hold.

1935
01:03:39,080 --> 01:03:40,100
(Suk Jin's secret strategy)

1936
01:03:40,100 --> 01:03:41,370
Okay.

1937
01:03:41,680 --> 01:03:43,550
That was so obvious.

1938
01:03:43,550 --> 01:03:45,550
Suk Jin, why are you talking
in front of other people?

1939
01:03:45,550 --> 01:03:47,720
- No, they didn't hear.
- Chanmi, what's this?

1940
01:03:47,720 --> 01:03:49,140
Got it? "Crow" is to hold.

1941
01:03:49,140 --> 01:03:50,220
"Crow" is to hold.

1942
01:03:50,220 --> 01:03:52,950
Once I blow the whistle, we start.
Please move around.

1943
01:03:52,950 --> 01:03:54,390
We moved around.

1944
01:03:54,390 --> 01:03:55,720
Okay.

1945
01:03:56,120 --> 01:03:58,660
- You moved back a lot.
- Ready,

1946
01:03:58,660 --> 01:03:59,930
set...

1947
01:03:59,930 --> 01:04:01,470
(Round 2 starts.)

1948
01:04:03,200 --> 01:04:04,260
I'm scared.

1949
01:04:04,260 --> 01:04:05,260
(She feels anxious
from the beginning.)

1950
01:04:05,260 --> 01:04:06,470
(They're relaxed.)

1951
01:04:07,100 --> 01:04:10,680
(It's me. I'm here.)

1952
01:04:10,680 --> 01:04:11,970
(Hitting)

1953
01:04:12,140 --> 01:04:14,300
<i>Meow, meow</i>

1954
01:04:14,370 --> 01:04:16,740
How many times did I meow?

1955
01:04:16,740 --> 01:04:18,550
(Goodness)

1956
01:04:20,220 --> 01:04:23,240
I was the only one meowing.
Everybody else was quiet.

1957
01:04:23,320 --> 01:04:24,760
Were you listening?

1958
01:04:25,850 --> 01:04:27,030
Hey.

1959
01:04:27,030 --> 01:04:28,490
Go that way.

1960
01:04:29,280 --> 01:04:31,600
(Chanmi meows.)

1961
01:04:31,890 --> 01:04:33,030
- Nice, nice.
<i>- Woof, woof</i>

1962
01:04:33,760 --> 01:04:35,700
Nice. Good.
We're on the same team.

1963
01:04:35,700 --> 01:04:37,490
(Jong Kook starts cheating again.)

1964
01:04:37,830 --> 01:04:39,100
- Go.
<i>- Meow</i>

1965
01:04:39,100 --> 01:04:40,370
<i>Meow, meow!</i>

1966
01:04:40,370 --> 01:04:42,160
(Don't you hear us meowing?)

1967
01:04:42,640 --> 01:04:45,240
(She hears her teammates meowing
and swings.)

1968
01:04:45,240 --> 01:04:47,080
<i>- Meow</i>
- Hey, wait.

1969
01:04:47,140 --> 01:04:49,100
<i>- Meow</i>
- Move.

1970
01:04:49,700 --> 01:04:50,950
Hyejeong.

1971
01:04:50,950 --> 01:04:52,950
(Team Red's strategy failed.)

1972
01:04:53,470 --> 01:04:54,550
(She swung at Suk Jin's meows.)

1973
01:04:54,550 --> 01:04:56,220
How many times did we meow?

1974
01:04:56,390 --> 01:04:58,280
Hyejeong is a mess.

1975
01:04:58,450 --> 01:05:00,490
- This is a mess.
- Why did you hit...

1976
01:05:00,490 --> 01:05:01,930
when we meowed?

1977
01:05:01,930 --> 01:05:03,280
I have the result.

1978
01:05:03,280 --> 01:05:05,330
- I hope we're not in last place.
- Please.

1979
01:05:05,330 --> 01:05:06,660
Team Green...

1980
01:05:07,120 --> 01:05:10,120
earned two points,

1981
01:05:10,390 --> 01:05:12,030
- so they're first place.
- Our team.

1982
01:05:13,370 --> 01:05:14,930
They're first place?

1983
01:05:14,930 --> 01:05:16,570
We were the best.

1984
01:05:16,570 --> 01:05:17,700
We're second place then.

1985
01:05:17,700 --> 01:05:20,850
One team has minus 4 points,
and the other team has minus 5.

1986
01:05:20,850 --> 01:05:22,100
- That's right.
- It's close.

1987
01:05:22,100 --> 01:05:23,640
We're pretty close.

1988
01:05:23,640 --> 01:05:24,950
You never know.

1989
01:05:24,950 --> 01:05:26,870
The team in second
with minus 4 points is...

1990
01:05:26,870 --> 01:05:30,240
(The team in second
with minus 4 points is...)

1991
01:05:30,240 --> 01:05:31,350
Team Red.

1992
01:05:31,350 --> 01:05:32,910
(Team Red is the 2nd place.)

1993
01:05:33,080 --> 01:05:34,620
- Really?
- Thank goodness.

1994
01:05:34,620 --> 01:05:36,330
- Thank goodness.
- We are the second place.

1995
01:05:36,430 --> 01:05:37,620
That was incredible.

1996
01:05:37,620 --> 01:05:38,720
We hit a lot.

1997
01:05:38,720 --> 01:05:40,700
There was a difference
of minus one point.

1998
01:05:40,800 --> 01:05:41,930
Thank goodness.

1999
01:05:41,930 --> 01:05:43,470
It was impossible to place first.

2000
01:05:43,470 --> 01:05:44,800
- It's a good result.
- That was incredible.

2001
01:05:44,800 --> 01:05:45,970
- Seriously.
- Okay. Good job.

2002
01:05:46,070 --> 01:05:48,570
Thus, we have
the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd places.

2003
01:05:48,570 --> 01:05:50,300
The 3rd place gets 1 meal ticket.

2004
01:05:52,140 --> 01:05:53,430
How beautiful!

2005
01:05:53,430 --> 01:05:55,410
It's the perfect place to visit
with the family.

2006
01:05:55,410 --> 01:05:56,600
(They enjoy the view of the sea
from the sea train.)

2007
01:05:56,600 --> 01:05:57,850
I will make sure I return.

2008
01:05:57,850 --> 01:05:59,450
Men and women of all ages
would like this place.

2009
01:05:59,740 --> 01:06:02,850
- It's the perfect spot for a date.
- Seriously.

2010
01:06:03,390 --> 01:06:05,820
You can sightsee
and eat delicious food here!

2011
01:06:05,820 --> 01:06:07,330
(He keeps overdoing it.)

2012
01:06:07,330 --> 01:06:08,580
The winter sea is pretty.

2013
01:06:08,580 --> 01:06:10,260
The winter sea is the best.

2014
01:06:10,260 --> 01:06:12,490
The winter sea is so pretty.

2015
01:06:14,120 --> 01:06:16,830
(The winter sea is so pretty.)

2016
01:06:16,830 --> 01:06:17,970
(So Min is an actress
who specializes in commercials.)

2017
01:06:17,970 --> 01:06:19,100
The winter sea!

2018
01:06:19,100 --> 01:06:20,600
Would you stand with Se Chan
and repeat what you said?

2019
01:06:20,600 --> 01:06:21,640
- Seriously.
- Stand in the middle.

2020
01:06:21,700 --> 01:06:24,280
Honey, the winter sea is so pretty.

2021
01:06:24,280 --> 01:06:25,600
Let's visit the next time.

2022
01:06:27,240 --> 01:06:28,280
You are already here!

2023
01:06:28,280 --> 01:06:30,300
You are already here!
What you said makes no sense.

2024
01:06:30,300 --> 01:06:31,370
Let's come back here.

2025
01:06:31,370 --> 01:06:32,580
Come back without the cameras.

2026
01:06:32,580 --> 01:06:35,240
Se Chan seems like
he is in his late 40s.

2027
01:06:35,320 --> 01:06:36,390
"Let's visit sometime."

2028
01:06:37,660 --> 01:06:40,490
Now, order the snacks
using your meal tickets.

2029
01:06:40,490 --> 01:06:41,620
Here you go.

2030
01:06:41,620 --> 01:06:44,990
- I want egg bread.
- How about one jjajang bingsu...

2031
01:06:44,990 --> 01:06:46,160
and three egg bread?

2032
01:06:46,160 --> 01:06:49,100
Then the person who can't eat
will receive a penalty badge.

2033
01:06:49,100 --> 01:06:50,430
- Oh, we can't share.
- No.

2034
01:06:50,430 --> 01:06:52,160
- Let's have one egg bread each.
- Okay.

2035
01:06:52,600 --> 01:06:55,200
- Egg bread is tasty.
- We will have one egg bread each.

2036
01:06:55,370 --> 01:06:56,700
One egg bread, please.

2037
01:06:56,700 --> 01:06:58,830
- One egg bread.
- Five egg breads,

2038
01:06:59,200 --> 01:07:00,450
one crunchy fried chicken,

2039
01:07:01,200 --> 01:07:02,800
and one jjajang bingsu.

2040
01:07:03,780 --> 01:07:05,010
We are rich.

2041
01:07:05,680 --> 01:07:06,970
They need to compete.

2042
01:07:06,970 --> 01:07:08,640
Let's decide who will eat.

2043
01:07:08,640 --> 01:07:09,740
That's right.

2044
01:07:10,220 --> 01:07:11,280
(Tapping)

2045
01:07:11,510 --> 01:07:12,990
(Let's play scissors.)

2046
01:07:13,830 --> 01:07:14,890
Let's play rock-paper-scissors.

2047
01:07:15,050 --> 01:07:17,430
(Kwang Soo also tells Jimin
to play scissors.)

2048
01:07:17,430 --> 01:07:18,550
Let's play rock-paper-scissors.

2049
01:07:18,620 --> 01:07:20,430
(Don't let Haha know, okay?)

2050
01:07:20,430 --> 01:07:21,830
- One winner.
- That's right.

2051
01:07:22,390 --> 01:07:23,620
One person will avoid getting
a penalty badge.

2052
01:07:23,830 --> 01:07:26,070
<i>- Rock...</i>
- Who will get a penalty badge?

2053
01:07:26,070 --> 01:07:27,700
Who will get a penalty badge?

2054
01:07:28,240 --> 01:07:29,410
(What?)

2055
01:07:29,410 --> 01:07:31,180
(Is Haha signaling Kwang Soo
to play scissors?)

2056
01:07:31,180 --> 01:07:32,910
- Everyone else will get it.
- Everyone else will get it.

2057
01:07:32,910 --> 01:07:34,510
Everyone else will get it.

2058
01:07:35,780 --> 01:07:37,370
<i>- Rock-paper-scissors
- Rock-paper-scissors</i>

2059
01:07:37,370 --> 01:07:38,720
(What will be the result?)

2060
01:07:38,820 --> 01:07:40,410
<i>- Rock-paper-scissors
- Rock-paper-scissors</i>

2061
01:07:40,580 --> 01:07:43,580
(Jimin plays scissors by herself.)

2062
01:07:46,850 --> 01:07:47,950
(The three of them agreed
to play scissors.)

2063
01:07:47,950 --> 01:07:49,180
(All of them play rock.)

2064
01:07:49,180 --> 01:07:50,390
- How did this happen?
- They are the worst.

2065
01:07:50,850 --> 01:07:52,390
(Didn't we agree to play scissors?)

2066
01:07:52,390 --> 01:07:54,700
- They are the worst.
- Jimin has the worst luck.

2067
01:07:54,700 --> 01:07:57,800
(Jimin suffers alone
amidst a bunch of tricksters.)

2068
01:07:58,140 --> 01:07:59,740
- Why didn't you play scissors?
- My goodness.

2069
01:07:59,740 --> 01:08:00,760
For goodness' sake.

2070
01:08:00,760 --> 01:08:02,570
You are the absolute worst!

2071
01:08:02,570 --> 01:08:03,700
Hey.

2072
01:08:03,740 --> 01:08:05,330
- You are irredeemable.
- Hey.

2073
01:08:05,330 --> 01:08:07,740
- Kwang Soo is the worst.
- You are irredeemable.

2074
01:08:07,740 --> 01:08:08,970
You are the worst.

2075
01:08:09,180 --> 01:08:11,120
- I am disappointed in you, So Min.
- You get exhausted...

2076
01:08:11,120 --> 01:08:12,850
when you are stuck with them.

2077
01:08:13,470 --> 01:08:15,820
- They are too...
- You pass out when you go home.

2078
01:08:15,820 --> 01:08:18,780
- They betrayed each other just now.
- They play dirty.

2079
01:08:18,780 --> 01:08:19,910
Who will eat the egg bread?

2080
01:08:19,910 --> 01:08:21,660
- Let's play rock-paper-scissors.
- Okay.

2081
01:08:21,830 --> 01:08:22,890
For goodness' sake.

2082
01:08:23,260 --> 01:08:25,100
I am so upset.

2083
01:08:25,350 --> 01:08:27,830
Jimin, when you chose them
as your team members,

2084
01:08:28,070 --> 01:08:30,290
I wondered if you knew
what you were doing.

2085
01:08:30,740 --> 01:08:33,790
You chose the dirtiest ones
among us.

2086
01:08:34,340 --> 01:08:36,430
The three of them are the worst.

2087
01:08:36,760 --> 01:08:39,380
<i>Rock-paper-scissors</i>

2088
01:08:39,470 --> 01:08:40,840
Okay. Gosh.

2089
01:08:41,840 --> 01:08:43,800
(The three of them think alike.)

2090
01:08:43,800 --> 01:08:45,470
You guys are unbelievable.

2091
01:08:46,120 --> 01:08:47,420
For goodness' sake.

2092
01:08:47,420 --> 01:08:49,680
- For goodness' sake.
- For goodness' sake.

2093
01:08:49,680 --> 01:08:50,750
One person.

2094
01:08:50,750 --> 01:08:53,210
There is nothing beautiful about
the way they act.

2095
01:08:53,350 --> 01:08:54,550
I...

2096
01:08:54,660 --> 01:08:56,530
<i>You lose if you don't play,
rock-paper-scissors</i>

2097
01:08:56,630 --> 01:08:58,420
(Kwang Soo wins in the end.)

2098
01:08:58,420 --> 01:08:59,630
Okay!

2099
01:08:59,630 --> 01:09:00,720
<i>Rock-paper-scissors</i>

2100
01:09:00,720 --> 01:09:02,030
(Okay!)

2101
01:09:02,030 --> 01:09:03,220
(Panting)

2102
01:09:03,220 --> 01:09:04,370
Kwang Soo won.

2103
01:09:04,370 --> 01:09:06,090
(He goes to get the egg bread
without looking back.)

2104
01:09:06,090 --> 01:09:07,340
He is the worst.

2105
01:09:07,870 --> 01:09:09,370
I will eat the egg bread.

2106
01:09:10,240 --> 01:09:11,670
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

2107
01:09:11,910 --> 01:09:13,800
- Thank you for the food.
- The bingsu looks incredible.

2108
01:09:14,100 --> 01:09:15,670
That bingsu looks delicious.

2109
01:09:15,670 --> 01:09:17,320
Crunchy fried chicken is tasty
even when it's cold.

2110
01:09:17,320 --> 01:09:19,750
Mix it with chopsticks.

2111
01:09:20,450 --> 01:09:22,420
It looks delicious.
I wanted to eat ice cream.

2112
01:09:23,510 --> 01:09:25,960
Gosh, there is fruit.

2113
01:09:25,960 --> 01:09:27,380
It's really tasty.

2114
01:09:27,380 --> 01:09:28,660
(Delicious food impresses them.)

2115
01:09:29,850 --> 01:09:32,130
(The last dish)

2116
01:09:32,130 --> 01:09:34,370
It smells nice. I love egg bread.

2117
01:09:34,630 --> 01:09:36,370
Thank you for the food.

2118
01:09:36,700 --> 01:09:38,430
- It's tasty.
- It's so tasty.

2119
01:09:38,840 --> 01:09:39,890
It's warm.

2120
01:09:40,390 --> 01:09:42,000
- One is mine.
- How many is yours?

2121
01:09:42,040 --> 01:09:43,100
- One.
- You got it earlier.

2122
01:09:43,100 --> 01:09:44,880
- Kwang Soo, this is yours.
- Don't lie. You got it earlier.

2123
01:09:44,880 --> 01:09:46,170
Ji Hyo gave it to me.

2124
01:09:47,000 --> 01:09:49,080
(As she delivers the egg bread,)

2125
01:09:49,080 --> 01:09:51,040
(she takes her share.)

2126
01:09:53,280 --> 01:09:54,420
If you are going to do that,

2127
01:09:54,540 --> 01:09:56,290
what use are the rules?

2128
01:09:56,380 --> 01:09:58,660
- You care about the rules?
- I learned from you.

2129
01:09:58,990 --> 01:10:00,720
If you are going to eat
like an animal...

2130
01:10:01,680 --> 01:10:03,050
(Kwang Soo should think back
to how he was.)

2131
01:10:03,050 --> 01:10:04,590
I learned from you.

2132
01:10:04,590 --> 01:10:06,960
It's so tasty.

2133
01:10:07,090 --> 01:10:08,670
Kwang Soo has a lot.

2134
01:10:12,090 --> 01:10:13,430
Kwang Soo has a lot.

2135
01:10:14,100 --> 01:10:15,760
(Let me take this!)

2136
01:10:16,910 --> 01:10:19,000
(She eats a piece
that flew towards her.)

2137
01:10:19,380 --> 01:10:21,210
Kwang Soo got betrayed.

2138
01:10:24,280 --> 01:10:25,950
(My hands move faster
than your eyes can see.)

2139
01:10:26,010 --> 01:10:27,620
(It's delicious.)

2140
01:10:27,620 --> 01:10:29,420
Peck at the food like a pigeon.

2141
01:10:32,920 --> 01:10:35,350
(So these are my team members.)

2142
01:10:36,220 --> 01:10:37,220
How tasty!

2143
01:10:37,420 --> 01:10:38,590
It's delicious.

2144
01:10:38,660 --> 01:10:41,890
- Let's move on to the last race.
- Okay!

2145
01:10:41,890 --> 01:10:43,590
(With zero trust for each other,
they move on to the last mission.)

2146
01:10:44,670 --> 01:10:46,540
- What are these?
- Grilled Spanish mackerel?

2147
01:10:46,670 --> 01:10:48,130
I want the twisted donut.

2148
01:10:48,130 --> 01:10:51,430
These are the last dishes
of Tasty Road in Incheon.

2149
01:10:51,800 --> 01:10:54,880
Grilled Spanish mackerel became
famous in Incheon 40 years ago...

2150
01:10:54,880 --> 01:10:57,170
because it perfectly suited
makgeolli that was produced nearby.

2151
01:10:57,300 --> 01:10:59,420
- Okay.
- There is a story.

2152
01:10:59,670 --> 01:11:01,620
There is also
the sweet and sour crab...

2153
01:11:01,620 --> 01:11:03,320
which is a dish
of fried soft-shelled crab.

2154
01:11:03,380 --> 01:11:05,350
Then there is
the bean powder twisted donut...

2155
01:11:05,350 --> 01:11:07,630
which is made in
1 of the top 5 bakeries in Incheon.

2156
01:11:07,630 --> 01:11:09,350
- It looks delicious.
- We must eat it.

2157
01:11:09,720 --> 01:11:10,920
- It looks delicious.
- 1 of the top 5 bakeries.

2158
01:11:10,920 --> 01:11:13,220
The last mission you will do
to win these dishes is...

2159
01:11:13,220 --> 01:11:15,390
Heart Attack Survival.

2160
01:11:15,390 --> 01:11:17,790
(The last mission,
Heart Attack Survival)

2161
01:11:17,790 --> 01:11:18,960
At this place,

2162
01:11:18,960 --> 01:11:21,840
weapons are hidden.

2163
01:11:22,710 --> 01:11:23,800
Weapons?

2164
01:11:23,800 --> 01:11:25,300
If you find a weapon...

2165
01:11:25,300 --> 01:11:27,000
and touch another member,

2166
01:11:27,000 --> 01:11:28,780
a battle will take place.

2167
01:11:28,780 --> 01:11:30,640
If you win,
the other will be eliminated.

2168
01:11:30,640 --> 01:11:31,970
If you don't win,

2169
01:11:31,970 --> 01:11:34,640
the other will be given 10 seconds
to run away and find a weapon.

2170
01:11:35,540 --> 01:11:36,820
We need to find the weapons.

2171
01:11:36,820 --> 01:11:38,510
- This is a team battle, right?
- That's right.

2172
01:11:38,750 --> 01:11:41,350
Like earlier,
1st place gets 10 meal tickets,

2173
01:11:41,350 --> 01:11:44,200
2nd place gets 5 meal tickets,
and 3rd place gets 1 meal ticket.

2174
01:11:44,220 --> 01:11:45,550
We will have our fill today.

2175
01:11:45,720 --> 01:11:47,500
- You understood the rules, right?
- Yes.

2176
01:11:47,500 --> 01:11:49,590
- Move to your respective locations.
- Okay.

2177
01:11:49,590 --> 01:11:51,130
Take a hat each.

2178
01:11:51,240 --> 01:11:52,290
What will happen?

2179
01:11:53,890 --> 01:11:55,240
The race starts now.

2180
01:11:56,570 --> 01:11:59,080
- You are on your own.
- This is a team battle.

2181
01:11:59,470 --> 01:12:00,580
- Let's go!
- Let's go!

2182
01:12:01,170 --> 01:12:02,640
- Firstly,
- We need to find the weapons.

2183
01:12:02,640 --> 01:12:04,250
- let's look for boxes.
- Yes.

2184
01:12:05,080 --> 01:12:06,820
I don't see the weapons.

2185
01:12:08,090 --> 01:12:09,790
I don't think they are here.

2186
01:12:09,790 --> 01:12:11,320
(Searching thoroughly)

2187
01:12:11,490 --> 01:12:12,550
It's here.

2188
01:12:12,550 --> 01:12:14,160
(It's here!)

2189
01:12:14,160 --> 01:12:17,720
(He finds a weapon box
behind a pavilion!)

2190
01:12:19,030 --> 01:12:21,960
(What's the first weapon
Jae Suk found?)

2191
01:12:21,960 --> 01:12:24,090
"Make the other laugh
in 30 seconds."

2192
01:12:24,240 --> 01:12:25,390
It's too hard.

2193
01:12:25,700 --> 01:12:27,670
"Make the other laugh
in 30 seconds" is too hard.

2194
01:12:28,370 --> 01:12:31,240
(Make the other laugh
in 30 seconds?)

2195
01:12:32,080 --> 01:12:34,100
When the battle begins, slap me.

2196
01:12:34,100 --> 01:12:35,970
(He asks his cameraman.)

2197
01:12:37,620 --> 01:12:38,880
I can't slap you!

2198
01:12:38,880 --> 01:12:40,470
This is for the mission.

2199
01:12:40,840 --> 01:12:42,120
Okay?

2200
01:12:42,120 --> 01:12:44,320
(He gets roped into it.)

2201
01:12:45,380 --> 01:12:48,250
(He spots someone!)

2202
01:12:48,250 --> 01:12:49,330
Haha!

2203
01:12:49,830 --> 01:12:51,250
I think he is going to attack me.

2204
01:12:51,390 --> 01:12:52,460
Haha!

2205
01:12:53,290 --> 01:12:54,390
What?

2206
01:12:54,390 --> 01:12:56,220
(He touches Haha!)

2207
01:12:56,220 --> 01:12:57,460
- Come on.
- What's the weapon?

2208
01:12:57,460 --> 01:12:59,170
(What's the weapon?)

2209
01:12:59,370 --> 01:13:00,370
Let's go.

2210
01:13:01,130 --> 01:13:02,670
I need to make you laugh
in 30 seconds.

2211
01:13:02,670 --> 01:13:04,970
(I just need to suppress laughter
in 30 seconds.)

2212
01:13:04,970 --> 01:13:06,100
Okay? Get ready.

2213
01:13:06,210 --> 01:13:07,300
- Get ready.
- 30 seconds.

2214
01:13:07,300 --> 01:13:09,210
I feel like laughing already.
Hold on.

2215
01:13:09,410 --> 01:13:11,320
Get ready. Set, go.

2216
01:13:11,620 --> 01:13:12,820
Do it.

2217
01:13:13,710 --> 01:13:15,540
(Slapping)

2218
01:13:17,710 --> 01:13:20,010
(He stifles his laughter.)

2219
01:13:20,010 --> 01:13:21,090
One more time.

2220
01:13:21,380 --> 01:13:22,420
Hold on.

2221
01:13:22,420 --> 01:13:24,290
He laughed!

2222
01:13:24,550 --> 01:13:25,960
It doesn't matter if I laugh.

2223
01:13:25,960 --> 01:13:27,670
Do it one more time. Come on.

2224
01:13:28,960 --> 01:13:30,590
(He asks to get slapped again.)

2225
01:13:31,070 --> 01:13:32,590
Come here and slap me.

2226
01:13:32,590 --> 01:13:33,960
(Today, slapping Jae Suk
is his job.)

2227
01:13:33,960 --> 01:13:35,130
Slap me.

2228
01:13:35,130 --> 01:13:36,840
(Now, he slaps
even when he isn't asked.)

2229
01:13:36,840 --> 01:13:39,930
(Haha is barely suppressing
his laughter.)

2230
01:13:40,100 --> 01:13:42,500
(The angle becomes shaky.)

2231
01:13:42,500 --> 01:13:45,780
(His identity as a cameraman
becomes shaky as well.)

2232
01:13:45,780 --> 01:13:48,840
(Right now,
he is Jae Suk's assistant.)

2233
01:13:49,750 --> 01:13:51,850
How many times
do you have to slap me?

2234
01:13:52,010 --> 01:13:53,120
- Haha succeeded to defend himself.
- Okay!

2235
01:13:53,490 --> 01:13:55,130
- Run away.
- Okay!

2236
01:13:55,550 --> 01:13:57,490
For goodness' sake. Kwon Ryeol.

2237
01:13:57,850 --> 01:13:59,960
You should have slapped me,
not pushed me.

2238
01:14:00,160 --> 01:14:01,290
(I can't do that.)

2239
01:14:01,700 --> 01:14:04,240
You should have slapped hard
to make him laugh.

2240
01:14:04,240 --> 01:14:06,260
I would have laughed
if he slapped hard.

2241
01:14:07,840 --> 01:14:09,710
For goodness' sake.

2242
01:14:09,710 --> 01:14:11,800
(Another member is looking
for a weapon.)

2243
01:14:11,800 --> 01:14:12,910
What is this?

2244
01:14:12,910 --> 01:14:14,470
Who put this box upside down?

2245
01:14:14,470 --> 01:14:15,500
(He finds a box!)

2246
01:14:16,910 --> 01:14:18,140
My goodness.

2247
01:14:18,670 --> 01:14:19,780
I could really use a weapon.

2248
01:14:19,780 --> 01:14:21,210
(Have a ssireum match.)

2249
01:14:21,210 --> 01:14:23,750
"Make the other fall down first
during a ssireum match to win."

2250
01:14:24,140 --> 01:14:26,210
It's about ssireum.

2251
01:14:26,460 --> 01:14:28,220
That must be why
the box was upside down.

2252
01:14:28,790 --> 01:14:30,220
I knew I would find a weapon here.

2253
01:14:31,030 --> 01:14:32,550
Who should I take out?

2254
01:14:32,550 --> 01:14:34,290
(Now that he has a strong weapon,
he roams confidently.)

2255
01:14:34,290 --> 01:14:35,460
I see someone.

2256
01:14:36,830 --> 01:14:39,500
(He sees someone in the distance.)

2257
01:14:42,000 --> 01:14:44,800
(The back
of an unsuspecting member)

2258
01:14:44,800 --> 01:14:46,000
All right.

2259
01:14:46,000 --> 01:14:47,100
(Tapping)

2260
01:14:47,210 --> 01:14:48,340
He touched you.

2261
01:14:48,880 --> 01:14:50,920
(Me?)

2262
01:14:50,920 --> 01:14:51,970
He touched you.

2263
01:14:51,970 --> 01:14:53,040
- Go.
- Go.

2264
01:14:53,040 --> 01:14:54,170
What is it?

2265
01:14:54,510 --> 01:14:55,680
Let's have a ssireum match.

2266
01:14:55,680 --> 01:14:58,820
(Would you like to have
a ssireum match with me?)

2267
01:14:59,250 --> 01:15:01,330
There is a ssireum field.

2268
01:15:01,960 --> 01:15:03,630
- Will you pick me?
- What?

2269
01:15:03,830 --> 01:15:05,390
I just touched you.

2270
01:15:05,500 --> 01:15:06,630
Let's move to the ssireum field.

2271
01:15:06,630 --> 01:15:07,890
Let's go and watch
the ssireum match.

2272
01:15:08,220 --> 01:15:09,720
I will die in vain.

2273
01:15:09,720 --> 01:15:11,430
It would be nice
to take Kwang Soo out.

2274
01:15:12,260 --> 01:15:14,200
He used to be
a professional ssireum player!

2275
01:15:15,340 --> 01:15:16,710
I have a bad knee.

2276
01:15:16,710 --> 01:15:18,380
(He used to be
a professional ssireum player.)

2277
01:15:18,380 --> 01:15:19,580
So which knee is it?

2278
01:15:19,580 --> 01:15:20,800
- You don't need to know.
- What?

2279
01:15:21,000 --> 01:15:22,210
You don't need to know.

2280
01:15:22,950 --> 01:15:24,100
It's this knee!

2281
01:15:24,100 --> 01:15:25,750
- He grabbed this knee.
- Stop it.

2282
01:15:26,210 --> 01:15:27,840
Kwang Soo, you never know.

2283
01:15:27,840 --> 01:15:29,510
- Ssireum is...
- Jong Kook.

2284
01:15:29,510 --> 01:15:31,050
not about force.

2285
01:15:31,050 --> 01:15:32,920
I don't even know
how to tie the thigh band.

2286
01:15:33,920 --> 01:15:35,880
Like this.

2287
01:15:35,880 --> 01:15:37,290
(He helps Jong Kook first.)

2288
01:15:37,290 --> 01:15:38,290
Hey.

2289
01:15:38,290 --> 01:15:39,590
(He pulls with his might.)

2290
01:15:39,590 --> 01:15:41,500
(This is playing hard to get
with the thigh band.)

2291
01:15:42,460 --> 01:15:43,720
- Are you in pain?
- Yes.

2292
01:15:43,720 --> 01:15:44,890
Are you in pain?

2293
01:15:44,890 --> 01:15:46,070
Please bow.

2294
01:15:46,260 --> 01:15:47,740
Play fair.

2295
01:15:47,740 --> 01:15:49,130
(Running Man supports fair plays.)

2296
01:15:49,130 --> 01:15:51,840
Don't put too much force.

2297
01:15:51,840 --> 01:15:53,340
- Are you ready?
- Yes.

2298
01:15:53,880 --> 01:15:55,410
Set, go.

2299
01:15:55,410 --> 01:15:56,970
(The match of the century starts,
but it has an obvious ending.)

2300
01:15:57,950 --> 01:15:59,120
He's done.

2301
01:15:59,120 --> 01:16:00,580
(This is actually a close match.)

2302
01:16:00,580 --> 01:16:03,120
Hey, gosh. Hey!

2303
01:16:03,250 --> 01:16:06,350
You can't do that
with the thigh band.

2304
01:16:06,490 --> 01:16:08,490
You can't do this
with the thigh band.

2305
01:16:08,490 --> 01:16:09,850
(The thigh band is too loose.)

2306
01:16:09,850 --> 01:16:12,050
Spread your legs out.

2307
01:16:12,050 --> 01:16:13,390
Spread your legs out by a lot.

2308
01:16:13,390 --> 01:16:15,370
- He'll lean back once you attack.
- You can do it.

2309
01:16:15,370 --> 01:16:16,870
All right.

2310
01:16:17,170 --> 01:16:18,740
- Hey.
- Good job.

2311
01:16:18,740 --> 01:16:21,130
(He pretends to do a major inner
reaping throw and hits Jong Kook.)

2312
01:16:22,000 --> 01:16:23,740
The major inner reaping throw
was not successful.

2313
01:16:23,910 --> 01:16:26,340
Wouldn't Jong Kook obviously win?

2314
01:16:26,500 --> 01:16:30,170
- Jong Kook!
- Jong Kook!

2315
01:16:30,300 --> 01:16:32,010
I'm going to kill you.

2316
01:16:32,620 --> 01:16:34,840
(His beastly instinct has awoken.)

2317
01:16:35,090 --> 01:16:37,510
(He fixes his grasp
on the loose thigh band.)

2318
01:16:38,710 --> 01:16:39,750
Really?

2319
01:16:41,030 --> 01:16:43,050
Kwang Soo, this is not about force.

2320
01:16:43,220 --> 01:16:44,500
There you go.

2321
01:16:44,500 --> 01:16:45,830
(Jong Kook attacks,)

2322
01:16:45,830 --> 01:16:47,220
(but Kwang Soo defends.)

2323
01:16:47,220 --> 01:16:49,000
We have to win today, Kwang Soo.

2324
01:16:49,000 --> 01:16:50,630
I think he almost won.

2325
01:16:51,890 --> 01:16:54,460
(Kwang Soo attacks suddenly.)

2326
01:16:55,870 --> 01:16:58,670
(Ssireum is about skills!)

2327
01:16:59,000 --> 01:17:00,040
Oh, my!

2328
01:17:00,040 --> 01:17:02,170
(Jong Kook is a former wrestler.
Will he go down?)

2329
01:17:04,040 --> 01:17:05,950
(Kwang Soo collapses.)

2330
01:17:05,950 --> 01:17:08,380
(It was meaningless
to advance forward.)

2331
01:17:08,380 --> 01:17:09,490
(He got pinned down.)

2332
01:17:09,490 --> 01:17:12,120
Oh, my.

2333
01:17:12,990 --> 01:17:14,090
(That was exactly as predicted.)

2334
01:17:14,090 --> 01:17:15,220
Let's go.

2335
01:17:15,220 --> 01:17:17,590
- Good try.
- Great effort.

2336
01:17:18,160 --> 01:17:20,330
(That was a pathetic loss.)

2337
01:17:22,390 --> 01:17:24,030
- I did it.
- She did it.

2338
01:17:24,220 --> 01:17:26,890
- Push with your tongue.
- Up. Good job.

2339
01:17:27,000 --> 01:17:28,740
Her shoes are tight.

2340
01:17:28,740 --> 01:17:30,000
Oh, my.

2341
01:17:30,100 --> 01:17:31,300
Sorry.

2342
01:17:32,840 --> 01:17:36,000
- Thank you for the food.
- Thank you.

2343
01:17:36,380 --> 01:17:38,010
This is so good.

2344
01:17:38,010 --> 01:17:39,120
This is really good too.

2345
01:17:39,120 --> 01:17:41,040
The person
with most penalty badges...

2346
01:17:41,040 --> 01:17:42,950
and another person they pick
will get the penalty.

2347
01:17:43,340 --> 01:17:44,880
I really don't want it.

2348
01:17:44,880 --> 01:17:45,960
Currently...

2349
01:17:45,960 --> 01:17:48,790
(Who has
the most number of penalty badges?)

2350
01:17:48,790 --> 01:17:51,130
Jimin and So Min have
two penalty badges each.

2351
01:17:51,130 --> 01:17:53,250
(Jimin and So Min have
two penalty badges each.)

2352
01:17:53,290 --> 01:17:55,630
Everybody else has one each.

2353
01:17:56,220 --> 01:17:57,720
Last place has two?

2354
01:17:57,720 --> 01:17:59,090
Last place has two.

2355
01:17:59,760 --> 01:18:03,460
We have to decide the loser
between So Min and Jimin.

2356
01:18:03,460 --> 01:18:05,000
- Then...
- Should we do something?

2357
01:18:05,000 --> 01:18:06,970
- How about O-X?
- A lottery?

2358
01:18:06,970 --> 01:18:08,040
Let's do that.

2359
01:18:08,040 --> 01:18:09,800
That look was hurtful.

2360
01:18:09,950 --> 01:18:11,280
I'm curious.

2361
01:18:11,280 --> 01:18:13,970
1, 2, 3.

2362
01:18:13,970 --> 01:18:15,290
(The person with X gets the penalty.
Who will it be?)

2363
01:18:16,420 --> 01:18:20,250
(Jimin gets last place.)

2364
01:18:20,250 --> 01:18:21,530
This is unbelievable.

2365
01:18:22,290 --> 01:18:23,990
This is unbelievable. I'm upset now.

2366
01:18:23,990 --> 01:18:26,420
Jimin worked so hard today.

2367
01:18:26,420 --> 01:18:28,260
She worked the hardest.

2368
01:18:28,330 --> 01:18:31,390
Today's penalty is
colored whipped cream.

2369
01:18:31,390 --> 01:18:33,290
We added some coloring to it.

2370
01:18:33,290 --> 01:18:35,430
- There's coloring?
- What color is it?

2371
01:18:35,430 --> 01:18:38,740
Goodness, Jimin.

2372
01:18:38,880 --> 01:18:40,710
Goodness, Jimin.

2373
01:18:40,710 --> 01:18:42,880
- Why are you being fussy?
- Are you the same age?

2374
01:18:42,880 --> 01:18:43,910
- No.
- No.

2375
01:18:43,910 --> 01:18:45,120
- She's older.
- She's younger.

2376
01:18:45,120 --> 01:18:47,450
- We call each other by name.
- We use names.

2377
01:18:47,450 --> 01:18:48,450
It's American style.

2378
01:18:48,450 --> 01:18:50,840
- That's cool.
- Like "Jimin" and "Yuna".

2379
01:18:50,840 --> 01:18:52,120
Dong Hoon.

2380
01:18:52,790 --> 01:18:54,050
So Min.

2381
01:18:54,050 --> 01:18:55,550
Suk Jin.

2382
01:18:55,550 --> 01:18:57,550
We should do that too.

2383
01:18:57,550 --> 01:18:59,160
Suk Jin.

2384
01:18:59,420 --> 01:19:01,890
This is not beneficial
to you either.

2385
01:19:01,890 --> 01:19:04,030
Jimin, pick one person...

2386
01:19:04,030 --> 01:19:06,570
- to receive the penalty with you.
- One person?

2387
01:19:06,570 --> 01:19:08,910
Jimin, who upset you?

2388
01:19:09,070 --> 01:19:11,500
Weren't you most upset
with rock-paper-scissors?

2389
01:19:11,500 --> 01:19:13,600
They agreed on it,

2390
01:19:13,600 --> 01:19:15,710
- but somebody changed their mind.
- Right.

2391
01:19:15,710 --> 01:19:17,580
You can go behind
and push one person's back.

2392
01:19:17,580 --> 01:19:19,210
- Shall I?
- Jimin.

2393
01:19:20,970 --> 01:19:22,540
- Why?
- Jimin.

2394
01:19:23,250 --> 01:19:25,010
(Be quiet.)

2395
01:19:25,750 --> 01:19:27,510
- I got goosebumps.
- The person who gets pushed...

2396
01:19:27,680 --> 01:19:29,090
Oh, dear.

2397
01:19:30,750 --> 01:19:32,390
- What was that?
- You startled me.

2398
01:19:32,390 --> 01:19:33,830
Suk Jin, were you surprised?

2399
01:19:33,830 --> 01:19:35,920
- Suk Jin.
- Suk Jin, were you surprised?

2400
01:19:35,960 --> 01:19:37,220
Hey!

2401
01:19:37,220 --> 01:19:39,790
Jae Suk,
Suk Jin was really surprised.

2402
01:19:39,790 --> 01:19:41,760
(His heart dropped.)

2403
01:19:41,760 --> 01:19:44,580
(He gets startled by little things
at his age.)

2404
01:19:44,580 --> 01:19:46,800
"Suk Jin was really surprised."

2405
01:19:46,800 --> 01:19:48,600
- Suk Jin, were you surprised?
- Jae Suk, don't do that.

2406
01:19:48,600 --> 01:19:51,040
- Suk Jin was really surprised.
- Suk Jin.

2407
01:19:51,040 --> 01:19:52,880
- Suk Jin was really surprised.
- Were you?

2408
01:19:53,320 --> 01:19:56,490
Those two can't laugh.
It's just them two.

2409
01:19:57,090 --> 01:19:59,790
Those two can't laugh.
while everybody else can.

2410
01:19:59,880 --> 01:20:02,530
- She won't pick her own team.
- There's no need to.

2411
01:20:02,750 --> 01:20:05,030
Will she pick us?

2412
01:20:05,030 --> 01:20:06,850
(Let's see.)

2413
01:20:06,850 --> 01:20:10,030
(Are we trembling?)

2414
01:20:10,960 --> 01:20:12,170
(She goes on her knees.)

2415
01:20:12,170 --> 01:20:13,370
So Min.

2416
01:20:15,840 --> 01:20:17,970
- I wish you a healthy life.
- You're not going on your knees.

2417
01:20:17,970 --> 01:20:19,910
- I'll go with Kwang Soo.
- No!

2418
01:20:20,040 --> 01:20:21,300
You're not going on your knees.
I'll go with Kwang Soo.

2419
01:20:21,300 --> 01:20:22,910
(I was going on my knees!)

2420
01:20:22,910 --> 01:20:25,280
I was going on my knees!

2421
01:20:25,540 --> 01:20:27,670
I was just going on my knees! Hey!

2422
01:20:27,670 --> 01:20:29,590
I'm so relieved.

2423
01:20:30,790 --> 01:20:32,010
Good thing I went on my knees.

2424
01:20:32,120 --> 01:20:35,380
So Jimin and Kwang Soo
will get the penalty.

2425
01:20:35,880 --> 01:20:37,180
- Jimin.
- Yes?

2426
01:20:37,180 --> 01:20:39,350
- Please say a few words.
- I had a lot of fun.

2427
01:20:39,350 --> 01:20:43,220
I'm happy all of us from AOA
was on Running Man.

2428
01:20:43,220 --> 01:20:44,530
That's true.

2429
01:20:44,530 --> 01:20:47,070
Please listen to "Come See Me."

2430
01:20:47,070 --> 01:20:49,910
- "Come See Me"!
- "Come See Me."

2431
01:20:50,570 --> 01:20:52,800
Here's the penalty. 1, 2, 3.

2432
01:20:53,240 --> 01:20:55,380
(With green whipped cream,)

2433
01:20:55,380 --> 01:20:57,300
(they become green monsters.)

2434
01:20:57,300 --> 01:20:58,970
- What is that?
- Hold on.

2435
01:20:58,970 --> 01:21:00,140
What is it?

2436
01:21:00,340 --> 01:21:01,490
What's this?

2437
01:21:01,490 --> 01:21:02,620
Is it Lady Yondu?

2438
01:21:02,620 --> 01:21:04,510
Look at this.

2439
01:21:04,590 --> 01:21:05,880
What is this?

2440
01:21:06,420 --> 01:21:08,630
(We have to take pictures of this.)

2441
01:21:09,180 --> 01:21:10,880
It's artificial grass.

2442
01:21:10,880 --> 01:21:13,130
- Leave, all of you!
- Artificial grass.

2443
01:21:13,130 --> 01:21:15,460
- Let's conclude. 1, 2, 3.
- You're a soccer field.

2444
01:21:19,240 --> 01:21:20,570
(The unparalleled top agents
are here.)

2445
01:21:20,890 --> 01:21:22,460
(World star Ryan Reynolds)

2446
01:21:22,460 --> 01:21:24,260
(Female action warrior
Melanie Laurent)

2447
01:21:24,260 --> 01:21:26,100
(Rising action star
Adria Arjona)

2448
01:21:26,710 --> 01:21:29,340
(They'll select Running Man members
who'll join the top agents.)

2449
01:21:30,300 --> 01:21:32,080
(They must stand out...)

2450
01:21:32,080 --> 01:21:34,710
(and join the top agent team.)

2451
01:21:35,590 --> 01:21:37,680
(Only confident candidates
should apply.)

2452
01:21:38,160 --> 01:21:40,180
(Some attack each other
to get recruited...)

2453
01:21:40,180 --> 01:21:41,880
(while some defend.)

2454
01:21:42,490 --> 01:21:44,630
(Which Running Man members
will become the top agents?)

2455
01:21:46,050 --> 01:21:49,000
(While they were having fun,)

2456
01:21:50,330 --> 01:21:52,590
(laughter turned into screams.)

2457
01:21:52,960 --> 01:21:53,960
I have to avoid the ghost.

2458
01:21:53,960 --> 01:21:55,870
(A dangerous ghost is
hiding among them.)

2459
01:21:55,870 --> 01:21:58,910
(The identities of the top agents
get revealed.)

2460
01:21:59,500 --> 01:22:01,470
(What secrets do these
suspicious top agents have?)

2461
01:22:01,470 --> 01:22:03,300
(Ghost Hunter Race)
