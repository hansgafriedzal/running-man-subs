1
00:00:05,490 --> 00:00:06,830
- Hello. - Hi.

2
00:00:06,830 --> 00:00:09,560
- Hello. - Hi. You came to the airport.

3
00:00:09,660 --> 00:00:11,330
Gosh, you guys came to the airport.

4
00:00:11,330 --> 00:00:14,470
- We just came back... - We just got back.

5
00:00:14,470 --> 00:00:15,700
- from Vietnam. - We just got back.

6
00:00:15,700 --> 00:00:18,010
We rested for a bit at a capsule hotel nearby.

7
00:00:18,010 --> 00:00:19,070
- It was nice. - It was nice.

8
00:00:19,070 --> 00:00:20,080
I've never been to one before.

9
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:22,010
It'd be nice to rent the room on a monthly basis.

10
00:00:22,010 --> 00:00:25,080
- Why don't you do that, Suk Jin? - If I do, won't I get a discount?

11
00:00:25,080 --> 00:00:30,420
You're always trying to leave home whenever you can, right?

12
00:00:30,450 --> 00:00:31,750
He's pretending to be a bachelor.

13
00:00:34,120 --> 00:00:36,530
And recently, Suk Jin...

14
00:00:36,530 --> 00:00:39,290
went to Vietnam with his wife on a trip.

15
00:00:39,290 --> 00:00:40,630
- Right. - He taught So Min about Vietnam.

16
00:00:40,630 --> 00:00:42,860
- It was your first time there. - Yes, that's right.

17
00:00:42,860 --> 00:00:45,470
So he taught So Min how to eat pho property.

18
00:00:45,470 --> 00:00:48,240
"Hey, you need to add everything on that plate."

19
00:00:48,240 --> 00:00:51,110
"I don't add the cilantro since I don't like it."

20
00:00:51,110 --> 00:00:54,610
"You must squeeze the lime hard. That's not how you do it."

21
00:00:54,610 --> 00:00:56,910
"Hey, that's not authentic pho then."

22
00:00:56,910 --> 00:00:58,180
- "Do you want to switch with mine?" - "Don't say that you had real pho."

23
00:00:58,180 --> 00:01:00,320
"You never listen to me. Gosh."

24
00:01:01,020 --> 00:01:03,220
- I was... - "You never listen to me. Gosh."

25
00:01:04,550 --> 00:01:06,220
- I was... - "What is this?"

26
00:01:06,220 --> 00:01:07,260
"What is this?"

27
00:01:08,460 --> 00:01:09,490
That really happened.

28
00:01:10,130 --> 00:01:11,890
"Why do I smell cilantro?"

29
00:01:12,460 --> 00:01:14,230
"Hey, is this cilantro?"

30
00:01:14,230 --> 00:01:16,300
"This grass is cilantro. Goodness."

31
00:01:16,300 --> 00:01:18,030
It was hilarious.

32
00:01:18,030 --> 00:01:20,200
Their cilantro has a rectangular shape.

33
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:22,100
- Right. It looks different. - Right.

34
00:01:22,100 --> 00:01:24,070
Vietnamese cilantro looks...

35
00:01:24,070 --> 00:01:25,670
- different from the Korean one. - Right.

36
00:01:25,670 --> 00:01:28,140
- It was so funny. - He was the worst.

37
00:01:28,380 --> 00:01:32,950
Anyway, a lot of people in Vietnam...

38
00:01:32,950 --> 00:01:35,550
showed us a lot of support...

39
00:01:35,550 --> 00:01:37,220
and cheered for us.

40
00:01:37,220 --> 00:01:39,290
I'd like to express my sincerest gratitude.

41
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:42,220
Thank you.

42
00:01:42,220 --> 00:01:43,490
- Thank you. - Thank you.

43
00:01:43,490 --> 00:01:44,660
Thank you so much.

44
00:01:44,660 --> 00:01:46,230
Thank you.

45
00:01:46,490 --> 00:01:49,130
Before I explain to you about today's race...

46
00:01:49,130 --> 00:01:51,330
- I heard Ryan Reynolds is joining. - Right.

47
00:01:51,330 --> 00:01:53,670
- There were articles about it. - I found out from an article.

48
00:01:53,670 --> 00:01:55,970
- He was in "Deadpool." - I'm so excited today.

49
00:01:55,970 --> 00:01:58,110
He and I are the same age.

50
00:01:58,110 --> 00:01:59,310
- You are? Really? - They are the same age.

51
00:01:59,310 --> 00:02:00,940
- You guys should be friends. - Right.

52
00:02:01,110 --> 00:02:02,740
But he's married and has kids too.

53
00:02:03,380 --> 00:02:05,580
- Right. - But he's married and has kids too.

54
00:02:07,580 --> 00:02:08,580
You should get married too.

55
00:02:08,580 --> 00:02:10,220
- Suk Jin... - Anyway, before we start today,

56
00:02:10,220 --> 00:02:11,920
we'll bring in a guest who will join us.

57
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:13,860
- There's a guest? - I saw the guest earlier.

58
00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:14,960
All right.

59
00:02:21,860 --> 00:02:23,430
- Hello. - My gosh.

60
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:24,970
Hello.

61
00:02:24,970 --> 00:02:26,970
- Nice to meet you. - It's great to see you.

62
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:29,470
What's she doing with the jacket?

63
00:02:29,770 --> 00:02:32,110
- I mean why... - What's she doing with her lips?

64
00:02:32,110 --> 00:02:33,380
What's wrong with her?

65
00:02:33,380 --> 00:02:35,840
Stop it. Cut the music. Cut it.

66
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:37,850
Bo Ra. Goodness, Bo Ra.

67
00:02:38,010 --> 00:02:40,820
- It was really fun when she joined. - Didn't people tell you that a lot?

68
00:02:40,820 --> 00:02:42,780
- Brave Dancer. - Brave Hwang.

69
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:46,820
Bo Ra, you're here to interpret for Ryan Reynolds, right?

70
00:02:46,820 --> 00:02:48,290
- Really? - I beg your pardon?

71
00:02:48,290 --> 00:02:50,090
- What? - Yes. She must speak English.

72
00:02:50,090 --> 00:02:52,390
- I can't speak a word of English. - Really?

73
00:02:52,390 --> 00:02:54,130
I can't speak a word of English.

74
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:55,460
Really?

75
00:02:55,460 --> 00:02:58,770
Actually, people criticized me a lot when I did a show with Paris Hilton.

76
00:02:58,770 --> 00:03:00,670
- Why? - They questioned why I was there...

77
00:03:00,670 --> 00:03:02,200
when I spoke no English at all.

78
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:04,370
- You're that bad? - I'm awful. What should I do?

79
00:03:04,370 --> 00:03:06,270
I know his wife though. The actress with a mole.

80
00:03:06,270 --> 00:03:07,410
- Blake? - Yes. The woman with the mole.

81
00:03:07,410 --> 00:03:10,010
Actually, you resemble her a bit.

82
00:03:10,010 --> 00:03:12,250
- I see a resemblance. - Right.

83
00:03:12,450 --> 00:03:13,750
Are you here because you're her lookalike?

84
00:03:13,750 --> 00:03:15,850
- That's why she is here. - That must be it.

85
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:17,220
- That's it. - Give her a round of applause.

86
00:03:17,220 --> 00:03:19,220
- Welcome. - She's his wife's lookalike.

87
00:03:19,220 --> 00:03:20,720
- She's Blake's lookalike. - Right.

88
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:23,020
- There has to be a reason. - She was here for a reason.

89
00:03:23,020 --> 00:03:25,130
- I should mark my face. - Mark a mole on your face.

90
00:03:25,130 --> 00:03:27,560
Today, you will be meeting with Ryan Reynolds,

91
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:30,830
Melanie Laurent, and Adria Arjona, the main cast of a new film...

92
00:03:30,830 --> 00:03:34,940
directed by the master of films, Michael Bay.

93
00:03:34,940 --> 00:03:36,470
- Really? - We'll meet all of them?

94
00:03:36,470 --> 00:03:37,640
We'll meet other actresses too?

95
00:03:37,640 --> 00:03:39,010
- Really? All of them? - Melanie...

96
00:03:39,010 --> 00:03:43,550
They will land in Korea this morning and must depart this evening.

97
00:03:43,550 --> 00:03:46,410
They will only spend two hours with us.

98
00:03:46,650 --> 00:03:49,450
- I know it's a bit sad, but... - They are here only for a day.

99
00:03:49,450 --> 00:03:51,620
- Giving us two hours is a lot. - Right.

100
00:03:51,620 --> 00:03:53,320
- They are here only for a day. - Of course.

101
00:03:53,320 --> 00:03:55,590
So you'll meet them at your final mission.

102
00:03:55,590 --> 00:03:57,030
These visiting stars...

103
00:03:57,030 --> 00:03:59,630
will look at your profiles as well as Bo Ra's...

104
00:03:59,630 --> 00:04:02,600
and personally choose three members for their own team.

105
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:04,730
They will choose 3 members for their teams themselves.

106
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,500
Just by looking at our photos?

107
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:08,670
- I hope Ryan recognizes me. - Please.

108
00:04:08,670 --> 00:04:10,140
I hope they have a different standard for looks.

109
00:04:10,410 --> 00:04:12,310
- Send the photo? - We have to send it to you?

110
00:04:12,310 --> 00:04:13,540
Let's see.

111
00:04:15,540 --> 00:04:17,280
How about this for Suk Jin?

112
00:04:19,010 --> 00:04:20,320
- Jae Suk. That's... - Is this good?

113
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:22,580
- That's a terrible photo. - My gosh.

114
00:04:22,580 --> 00:04:25,720
This is Kwang Soo's photo. Goodness, this photo...

115
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:27,660
- Isn't it nice? - No one can beat this.

116
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:29,120
- It's good, right? - Yes.

117
00:04:33,660 --> 00:04:35,860
- I'll send a photo of Ji Hyo. - Yes, send it.

118
00:04:39,100 --> 00:04:40,700
- I like photos like this. - Look at her.

119
00:04:41,870 --> 00:04:43,510
- I just sent it to you. - Let me see.

120
00:04:43,510 --> 00:04:44,840
- Let me see. - Gosh, he's...

121
00:04:44,910 --> 00:04:46,510
- Let me see. - good at taking photos.

122
00:04:50,550 --> 00:04:51,550
- Who is it? - Who is this?

123
00:04:51,550 --> 00:04:52,650
- Who is this? - It's Suk Jin.

124
00:04:52,650 --> 00:04:53,880
It's Suk Jin.

125
00:04:55,180 --> 00:04:56,420
That's Suk Jin?

126
00:04:56,480 --> 00:04:58,490
- That's me? - Who is this?

127
00:04:58,520 --> 00:05:00,020
Isn't this a middle-aged woman?

128
00:05:02,020 --> 00:05:03,730
- Who is it? - It's Suk Jin.

129
00:05:03,730 --> 00:05:06,330
- Oh, no. I feel bad. - Poor him.

130
00:05:06,900 --> 00:05:08,230
Goodness.

131
00:05:08,230 --> 00:05:11,730
- I sent you the photo. - You sent me all the photos.

132
00:05:17,940 --> 00:05:20,310
- Okay. - This is just the first 20 minutes.

133
00:05:20,310 --> 00:05:21,680
Okay. Hello.

134
00:05:42,860 --> 00:05:44,030
It's going to start right now.

135
00:05:44,030 --> 00:05:45,200
I see.

136
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:46,530
We'll start now.

137
00:06:06,520 --> 00:06:07,660
Choose the ones...

138
00:06:07,660 --> 00:06:09,360
- you want to team up with. - So beautiful.

139
00:06:09,420 --> 00:06:10,560
We have...

140
00:06:13,430 --> 00:06:14,830
- A huge transformation... - Here...

141
00:06:14,830 --> 00:06:16,130
first off guys.

142
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:17,630
Yes.

143
00:06:17,930 --> 00:06:19,570
- Okay. - Who do we choose?

144
00:06:19,830 --> 00:06:21,300
- Do you know who you want? - We're picking three.

145
00:06:21,300 --> 00:06:22,640
- One each. - Okay.

146
00:06:22,640 --> 00:06:23,710
And I'm going to pick...

147
00:06:25,210 --> 00:06:26,910
I'll tell you the rules now.

148
00:06:27,340 --> 00:06:30,010
- It's called the Ghost Hunter Race. - What's that?

149
00:06:30,210 --> 00:06:31,410
Is there a spy?

150
00:06:31,410 --> 00:06:33,110
Among the nine of you,

151
00:06:33,310 --> 00:06:34,780
two of you are ghosts.

152
00:06:34,780 --> 00:06:36,480
- When did you get the mission? - When did you film it?

153
00:06:36,580 --> 00:06:37,790
Do they know that they are ghosts?

154
00:06:37,790 --> 00:06:38,920
Yes, they do.

155
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:40,290
- They are aware of it? - The other members are hunters...

156
00:06:40,290 --> 00:06:41,690
- who must catch the ghosts. - No way.

157
00:06:41,990 --> 00:06:44,460
Then, you must have filmed this part in advance.

158
00:06:44,460 --> 00:06:46,030
They must've gone to the hotel after filming it.

159
00:06:46,030 --> 00:06:47,600
Right. It must've been after taking the shower.

160
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:48,800
- And they went back after that. - In their room.

161
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:51,170
I saw Se Chan and Jae Suk walking around together earlier.

162
00:06:51,270 --> 00:06:52,870
- We had a burger. - We had a burger.

163
00:06:52,870 --> 00:06:54,100
We got ready quickly.

164
00:06:54,270 --> 00:06:56,540
There are three rounds in total.

165
00:06:56,540 --> 00:06:58,970
After each round, depending on the result,

166
00:06:58,970 --> 00:07:02,210
2 slots of 2 name tags each will be attached on the penalty roulette.

167
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:06,510
After the final mission, Ryan will pick the penalty himself.

168
00:07:07,650 --> 00:07:10,420
After the final mission, when the penalty roulette is spun,

169
00:07:10,420 --> 00:07:14,520
if the chosen slot contains a ghost, the ghosts will win.

170
00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:15,820
All of the hunters...

171
00:07:15,820 --> 00:07:17,090
- will face the penalty. - All of us?

172
00:07:17,630 --> 00:07:19,960
If the chosen slot doesn't have a ghost, the hunters will win.

173
00:07:19,960 --> 00:07:22,130
And two ghosts will face the penalty.

174
00:07:23,130 --> 00:07:24,670
So the ghosts will try to sabotage the games?

175
00:07:24,670 --> 00:07:26,300
The ghosts must have their names on the roulette.

176
00:07:26,300 --> 00:07:27,570
They must be in every slot.

177
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:29,400
They might be obvious to spot.

178
00:07:29,500 --> 00:07:30,610
I don't get it.

179
00:07:30,610 --> 00:07:32,110
I will never be the ghost.

180
00:07:32,110 --> 00:07:33,370
Bo Ra, stop pretending you don't get it.

181
00:07:33,370 --> 00:07:35,680
- No, I'm not pretending. - She's pretending to not get it.

182
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:37,710
- Bo Ra. That's a shame. - It's really not me.

183
00:07:37,710 --> 00:07:39,650
- She already got the mission. - We found out from the get-go.

184
00:07:39,650 --> 00:07:40,980
Gosh, what a shame.

185
00:07:40,980 --> 00:07:42,450
- It's really not me. - We found out right away.

186
00:07:42,450 --> 00:07:44,290
If I'm the ghost, I won't star on Running Man.

187
00:07:45,290 --> 00:07:46,920
- That was a hard move. - It's really not me.

188
00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:48,590
- If it's me, I won't come here. - By the way,

189
00:07:48,590 --> 00:07:50,890
why did people criticize you when you starred on a show...

190
00:07:50,890 --> 00:07:52,130
with Paris Hilton?

191
00:07:52,930 --> 00:07:54,600
I was over-the-top.

192
00:07:55,960 --> 00:07:57,400
I was over-the-top.

193
00:08:00,770 --> 00:08:02,500
Why? When did that happen?

194
00:08:03,300 --> 00:08:04,470
I was overly happy.

195
00:08:04,470 --> 00:08:07,080
I said, "Thank you."

196
00:08:07,540 --> 00:08:09,640
I said, "Thank you."

197
00:08:09,640 --> 00:08:10,950
You made big reactions.

198
00:08:10,950 --> 00:08:13,010
- You know my reactions are big. - Yes, they are.

199
00:08:13,010 --> 00:08:14,520
I said, "My gosh, thank you."

200
00:08:14,750 --> 00:08:16,220
They said I was pathetic.

201
00:08:17,490 --> 00:08:18,620
Will you...

202
00:08:18,620 --> 00:08:19,850
- take it down a notch today? - "Pathetic".

203
00:08:19,850 --> 00:08:21,960
I'm not going to make any reactions today.

204
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:23,490
But you're making big reactions right now.

205
00:08:23,490 --> 00:08:25,130
- My gosh. - No, later when they come.

206
00:08:25,130 --> 00:08:26,960
- Bo Ra is so funny. - My gosh.

207
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:28,600
- Bo Ra. Seriously. - I won't make reactions.

208
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:30,730
Everyone, let's get moving for the first mission.

209
00:08:30,730 --> 00:08:32,570
- Get on the bus, everyone. - Okay.

210
00:08:32,700 --> 00:08:36,000
So we should try to let the ghosts win the games?

211
00:08:38,710 --> 00:08:40,210
I can see my breath now.

212
00:08:41,410 --> 00:08:43,210
- Where's So Min? - I'm right here.

213
00:08:43,910 --> 00:08:44,980
What are you doing there?

214
00:08:44,980 --> 00:08:46,210
I sat here because I saw a camera here.

215
00:08:46,210 --> 00:08:47,380
Good job.

216
00:08:47,450 --> 00:08:48,550
"What are you doing there?"

217
00:08:48,550 --> 00:08:50,220
- You're running your own channel. - Jong Kook.

218
00:08:50,250 --> 00:08:52,990
Running Man is rated 12.

219
00:08:54,020 --> 00:08:55,920
- It's her online channel. - Her online channel.

220
00:08:55,990 --> 00:08:57,560
- People would like the video. - Bo Ra.

221
00:08:57,590 --> 00:08:58,890
If you could run your own channel, what will you do?

222
00:08:58,890 --> 00:09:00,060
I'm already running my own channel.

223
00:09:00,060 --> 00:09:01,260
- Really? - You walk.

224
00:09:01,260 --> 00:09:03,330
- What do you on the channel? - You told us that you walk.

225
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:04,630
It's called WalkTalk. I walk in my videos.

226
00:09:04,670 --> 00:09:06,000
- You walk? - I see.

227
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,640
- I took about 100,000 steps. - That's so cool.

228
00:09:07,640 --> 00:09:10,040
Hey, I don't think to watch you walk will be entertaining.

229
00:09:10,040 --> 00:09:11,510
It's so fun, Suk Jin.

230
00:09:12,540 --> 00:09:14,610
It's so fun, Suk Jin.

231
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:16,440
Are you kidding me right now?

232
00:09:16,840 --> 00:09:20,080
It's a killer video. I do more than just walking.

233
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:21,550
- Walking is no fun. - It's crazy.

234
00:09:21,550 --> 00:09:22,850
Do people criticize you on your channel too?

235
00:09:22,850 --> 00:09:24,550
- They don't criticize me there. - I see.

236
00:09:25,590 --> 00:09:27,790
I don't have a lot of subscribers.

237
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:30,360
- There are no people to begin with. - Bo Ra.

238
00:09:30,760 --> 00:09:32,690
Goodness, her story is really funny today.

239
00:09:32,690 --> 00:09:34,560
- It's nice. - It's entertaining.

240
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:36,830
Suk Jin has been meeting up...

241
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:39,600
- with people who are on YouTube. - What do you want to do there?

242
00:09:39,630 --> 00:09:41,900
- You'll start an online channel? - Will you talk about stocks?

243
00:09:41,970 --> 00:09:43,340
They wanted to meet up.

244
00:09:43,340 --> 00:09:44,840
- Suk Jin... - I don't think I can do it.

245
00:09:44,840 --> 00:09:46,640
will talk about how to age beautifully.

246
00:09:47,080 --> 00:09:48,640
- Suk Jin... - I don't think I can do it.

247
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:50,310
He will talk about how to age beautifully.

248
00:09:50,310 --> 00:09:51,580
That's great.

249
00:09:53,750 --> 00:09:55,050
By the way, she must be mentally strong.

250
00:09:55,050 --> 00:09:56,850
Suk Jin, stop talking. We need to play games now.

251
00:09:58,050 --> 00:09:59,490
Nice timing.

252
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:01,460
Good job.

253
00:10:01,590 --> 00:10:02,820
- That was great. - That hit the spot.

254
00:10:02,920 --> 00:10:04,490
- Let's cut him off. - Nice.

255
00:10:04,490 --> 00:10:06,290
- Cut Suk Jin off. - That was a great line.

256
00:10:06,290 --> 00:10:08,830
As for the first mission, everyone must pass.

257
00:10:08,830 --> 00:10:10,360
- Come on. - Come on.

258
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:13,130
- We lost this one. - This isn't going to work.

259
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:15,140
If you complete the mission at least once out of five attempts,

260
00:10:15,140 --> 00:10:16,900
we won't attach your name tags on the roulette.

261
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:21,110
But if you fail, 4 name tags will be attached on 2 slots.

262
00:10:21,310 --> 00:10:23,210
Will the ghosts sabotage the game? What will they do?

263
00:10:23,210 --> 00:10:24,780
- They'll sabotage the game. - Right? Okay.

264
00:10:25,280 --> 00:10:26,610
All right. As for this mission,

265
00:10:26,610 --> 00:10:28,180
it's an upgrade strawberry game.

266
00:10:28,250 --> 00:10:30,080
It's called Kwang Soo Is Not a Fool.

267
00:10:30,520 --> 00:10:32,750
The name of the game is Kwang Soo Is Not a Fool?

268
00:10:32,750 --> 00:10:34,520
- Kwang Soo is the main character. - Kwang Soo Is Not a Fool.

269
00:10:34,520 --> 00:10:36,090
You'll follow the tempo of the strawberry game...

270
00:10:36,090 --> 00:10:38,060
and listen to the arithmetic expression provided by the staff.

271
00:10:38,060 --> 00:10:41,300
You need to call out his name in order on the beat.

272
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:43,030
For example, we'll say "Run, Kwang Soo."

273
00:10:43,030 --> 00:10:44,830
"What's 3 plus 2?"

274
00:10:44,970 --> 00:10:46,130
The answer is five.

275
00:10:46,300 --> 00:10:48,740
You'll call out his name only five times.

276
00:10:48,740 --> 00:10:50,440
Once you finish calling out his name five times,

277
00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:52,670
you can say on the next beat, "He's not a fool."

278
00:10:52,710 --> 00:10:54,180
That's so hard.

279
00:10:54,380 --> 00:10:56,780
You came up with such an insulting game.

280
00:10:57,110 --> 00:10:59,210
"He's not a fool." Of course, not. I'm not a fool.

281
00:10:59,210 --> 00:11:01,820
We can make sure that you are not a fool with this game.

282
00:11:01,820 --> 00:11:02,880
What?

283
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:04,990
Here's the order. Bo Ra, Se Chan,

284
00:11:04,990 --> 00:11:07,360
- Haha, Ji Hyo, and So Min. - Okay.

285
00:11:07,420 --> 00:11:08,720
- Okay. - Start.

286
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:10,260
Run, Kwang Soo.

287
00:11:10,260 --> 00:11:11,690
What's 3 plus 1?

288
00:11:12,030 --> 00:11:13,730
Kwang Soo, Kwang Soo Kwang Soo, Kwang Soo

289
00:11:14,230 --> 00:11:15,300
He's not a fool.

290
00:11:15,900 --> 00:11:17,060
- No, no. - No.

291
00:11:17,370 --> 00:11:19,470
Kwang Soo, Kwang Soo Kwang Soo, Kwang Soo

292
00:11:19,470 --> 00:11:20,640
He's not a fool

293
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:21,770
- What? - No, no.

294
00:11:22,070 --> 00:11:23,640
- That's not how you play. - Okay.

295
00:11:23,640 --> 00:11:25,310
- Listen. - Why don't we start first?

296
00:11:25,310 --> 00:11:26,540
- Bo Ra. - Okay.

297
00:11:26,540 --> 00:11:29,010
- Bo Ra, you should keep walking. - Okay.

298
00:11:29,010 --> 00:11:30,680
Okay.

299
00:11:30,680 --> 00:11:32,210
- You should just walk instead. - It's because Bo Ra...

300
00:11:32,210 --> 00:11:33,980
- is on the bus. - It's because she's on the bus.

301
00:11:33,980 --> 00:11:35,820
- You should walk. - She should play it while walking.

302
00:11:35,980 --> 00:11:37,890
- We'll start with Jong Kook. - Okay.

303
00:11:37,950 --> 00:11:40,250
- Se Chan, Ji Hyo, Haha, - We'll show you.

304
00:11:40,250 --> 00:11:42,320
- and So Min. This is the order. - I'll give it a try.

305
00:11:42,390 --> 00:11:43,930
- Run, Kwang Soo. - Slowly.

306
00:11:43,930 --> 00:11:45,290
What's 3 plus 3?

307
00:11:46,490 --> 00:11:47,530
Kwang Soo, Kwang Soo

308
00:11:48,060 --> 00:11:49,200
Kwang Soo, Kwang Soo

309
00:11:49,730 --> 00:11:50,870
Kwang Soo, Kwang Soo

310
00:11:51,330 --> 00:11:52,470
- He's not a fool! - He's not a fool!

311
00:11:52,570 --> 00:11:53,700
- Ji Hyo didn't say the line. - Why?

312
00:11:53,870 --> 00:11:55,800
- Ji Hyo didn't say it. - She said it.

313
00:11:55,970 --> 00:11:57,510
- Didn't you say the line? - I didn't?

314
00:11:57,570 --> 00:11:58,740
No, she said it.

315
00:11:59,310 --> 00:12:01,210
Kwang Soo, Kwang Soo

316
00:12:05,050 --> 00:12:06,650
You know the title of the game...

317
00:12:06,650 --> 00:12:07,650
- shouldn't have my mine in it. - We should say Ji Hyo's name.

318
00:12:07,650 --> 00:12:08,850
It should be, Run, Ji Hyo.

319
00:12:08,850 --> 00:12:09,920
Shouldn't it be Run, Ji Hyo?

320
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:11,650
- Or Get a Grip, Ji Hyo. - You should have raised them.

321
00:12:11,650 --> 00:12:13,550
- I raised my hands. - I saw it.

322
00:12:13,550 --> 00:12:14,820
- I saw it. - I won't let you slide from now on.

323
00:12:14,820 --> 00:12:15,960
Ji Hyo isn't a fool!

324
00:12:16,590 --> 00:12:18,930
- Hey, I'm not a fool. - She raised her hands.

325
00:12:18,990 --> 00:12:21,530
It's hard to say that Ji Hyo isn't...

326
00:12:21,530 --> 00:12:23,830
- a fool in this situation. - I agree.

327
00:12:23,830 --> 00:12:27,640
It's hard to say that Ji Hyo isn't a fool in this situation.

328
00:12:27,840 --> 00:12:29,540
- It's a bit iffy. - Right.

329
00:12:30,440 --> 00:12:31,570
- Right. - That's true.

330
00:12:31,570 --> 00:12:33,640
- That's true. - Okay. I'll raise them high.

331
00:12:33,640 --> 00:12:36,080
We should start with Bo Ra.

332
00:12:36,080 --> 00:12:37,250
- Sure. - What do you think?

333
00:12:37,380 --> 00:12:38,910
- Run, Kwang Soo. - Kwang Soo.

334
00:12:38,910 --> 00:12:40,280
What's 9 minus 7?

335
00:12:41,620 --> 00:12:42,680
Kwang Soo

336
00:12:43,180 --> 00:12:44,250
Kwang Soo

337
00:12:44,490 --> 00:12:45,620
- He's not a fool - He's not a fool

338
00:12:46,220 --> 00:12:47,420
Ji Hyo, you raised your hands, right?

339
00:12:47,490 --> 00:12:49,590
- You raised them too soon. - Ji Hyo.

340
00:12:55,830 --> 00:12:57,000
- He's not a fool - He's not a fool

341
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,070
I mean...

342
00:12:58,070 --> 00:12:59,970
You're nagging me for raising them and not raising them.

343
00:12:59,970 --> 00:13:01,140
What am I supposed to do?

344
00:13:01,140 --> 00:13:02,540
Ji Hyo, are you a ghost?

345
00:13:02,740 --> 00:13:03,840
No.

346
00:13:03,840 --> 00:13:05,840
- She might be the ghost. - No.

347
00:13:05,840 --> 00:13:07,010
She has to be.

348
00:13:07,010 --> 00:13:08,810
- It's really not me. - Ji Hyo.

349
00:13:09,180 --> 00:13:10,310
Look Jong Kook in his eye.

350
00:13:10,310 --> 00:13:12,110
- This must be burning. - He'll be watching you.

351
00:13:12,110 --> 00:13:13,480
The fur is burning now.

352
00:13:13,980 --> 00:13:15,820
- It's his laser beam. - This is impossible.

353
00:13:15,820 --> 00:13:17,120
- The back of my head hurts. - Let's do better.

354
00:13:17,180 --> 00:13:18,720
- Are you a ghost or a fool? - Earlier... No.

355
00:13:18,790 --> 00:13:19,790
Are you a fish or what?

356
00:13:19,790 --> 00:13:21,520
- Choose 1 of the 2. Ghost or fish? - Are you oats?

357
00:13:21,520 --> 00:13:23,320
- Are you oats or what? - I'm really not the ghost.

358
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:26,390
I desperately wish that you are not the ghost,

359
00:13:26,390 --> 00:13:28,660
- but I can't say that you are not. - We can't say that.

360
00:13:28,660 --> 00:13:30,600
- This keeps happening. - Listen.

361
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:33,830
Let's change the title to Ji Hyo Is Not a Fool.

362
00:13:34,640 --> 00:13:36,100
- Good job. - Okay.

363
00:13:36,700 --> 00:13:37,870
Let's try again.

364
00:13:37,870 --> 00:13:39,540
- Run, Kwang Soo. - Kwang Soo.

365
00:13:39,610 --> 00:13:40,980
What's 27 divided by 3?

366
00:13:44,180 --> 00:13:45,380
Kwang Soo, Kwang Soo

367
00:13:46,150 --> 00:13:47,450
Kwang Soo, Kwang Soo

368
00:13:48,050 --> 00:13:49,080
Kwang Soo, Kwang Soo

369
00:13:49,720 --> 00:13:50,890
Kwang Soo, Kwang Soo

370
00:13:54,260 --> 00:13:55,290
Kwang Soo, Kwang Soo

371
00:13:56,860 --> 00:13:58,060
Goodness.

372
00:13:59,260 --> 00:14:01,860
- Kwang Soo, Kwang Soo - Goodness.

373
00:14:01,860 --> 00:14:03,330
- Just one. - My gosh.

374
00:14:03,330 --> 00:14:05,000
You should have said it once.

375
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,930
- Se Chan isn't a ghost though. - You should've said it once.

376
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:08,500
I don't think he's a ghost.

377
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:10,140
Can you think that I'm a ghost?

378
00:14:12,270 --> 00:14:14,510
I got confused. I thought it was an even number.

379
00:14:14,710 --> 00:14:16,840
If we're going to succeed as a team,

380
00:14:16,840 --> 00:14:18,750
- Just 1 time. - let's say it either 1 or 2 times.

381
00:14:18,750 --> 00:14:20,380
- Once or twice is the best. - That's the best.

382
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:21,920
- All right. Everyone. - I...

383
00:14:22,080 --> 00:14:24,220
It's 1, 2, 3, 4.

384
00:14:24,490 --> 00:14:26,320
Do this. 1, 2. Kwang Soo, Kwang Soo

385
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:27,860
- I know. - Count to two and say his name.

386
00:14:27,860 --> 00:14:29,620
- Count to two and say his name. - Okay.

387
00:14:29,620 --> 00:14:31,830
- Let's try this, okay? - Stop it, old fart.

388
00:14:32,030 --> 00:14:34,400
Listen. I'm talking right now.

389
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:37,470
- That old fart. - Okay.

390
00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:39,330
Mr. Producer, let's do this.

391
00:14:39,400 --> 00:14:40,630
This is your last round.

392
00:14:40,900 --> 00:14:42,000
So Min will start first.

393
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,400
We need to get through this last round.

394
00:14:43,570 --> 00:14:44,710
Here we go.

395
00:14:44,710 --> 00:14:46,370
- Run, Kwang Soo. - Kwang Soo.

396
00:14:46,370 --> 00:14:47,580
What's 11 plus 6?

397
00:14:48,740 --> 00:14:49,910
Kwang Soo, Kwang Soo

398
00:14:50,310 --> 00:14:51,880
- Kwang Soo, Kwang Soo - It's 17.

399
00:14:51,880 --> 00:14:53,080
Kwang Soo, Kwang Soo

400
00:14:53,480 --> 00:14:54,880
Kwang Soo, Kwang Soo

401
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:56,480
Kwang Soo, Kwang Soo We're at 10 now.

402
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:57,920
Kwang Soo, Kwang Soo

403
00:14:58,020 --> 00:14:59,390
- Kwang Soo, Kwang Soo - We're at 14.

404
00:14:59,620 --> 00:15:01,020
- Kwang Soo, Kwang Soo - We're at 16.

405
00:15:06,090 --> 00:15:07,260
Kwang Soo

406
00:15:08,760 --> 00:15:09,900
Gosh.

407
00:15:11,130 --> 00:15:12,470
Kwang Soo

408
00:15:13,530 --> 00:15:15,170
- Hey, you. - He's a ghost!

409
00:15:15,300 --> 00:15:17,640
- You were supposed to say it once. - I said it early.

410
00:15:17,640 --> 00:15:19,210
- We were so close. - It was a mistake. I mean it.

411
00:15:19,210 --> 00:15:20,210
It was my mistake.

412
00:15:20,210 --> 00:15:21,910
- No, it can't be. He's a ghost. - He's a ghost.

413
00:15:21,910 --> 00:15:22,940
- It was my mistake. - He's a ghost.

414
00:15:22,940 --> 00:15:23,980
I mean...

415
00:15:23,980 --> 00:15:25,380
I did well in the beginning of the game.

416
00:15:25,610 --> 00:15:27,450
I did well during the last 5 rounds. I only made 1 mistake.

417
00:15:27,450 --> 00:15:29,180
You made a mistake when it counts the most!

418
00:15:29,950 --> 00:15:32,390
You made a mistake when it counts the most!

419
00:15:33,550 --> 00:15:34,890
You made a mistake at a critical moment.

420
00:15:35,560 --> 00:15:38,090
- This place is full of old farts! - It was a crucial moment!

421
00:15:38,530 --> 00:15:40,190
Hey, you. Let me say something.

422
00:15:40,190 --> 00:15:42,000
Hey, this feels like a team dinner.

423
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:45,630
- How many principals do we have? - Let's try one more time.

424
00:15:45,630 --> 00:15:47,030
Okay. Give us one more chance.

425
00:15:47,270 --> 00:15:49,370
"Give us one more chance." He's an old fart.

426
00:15:49,370 --> 00:15:50,810
If we said "He's a fool",

427
00:15:50,810 --> 00:15:52,210
- it would've been over? - Yes.

428
00:15:52,210 --> 00:15:53,970
It's not "He's a fool." It's "He's not a fool."

429
00:15:54,940 --> 00:15:56,880
You need to understand the game properly.

430
00:15:57,110 --> 00:15:59,550
- That wasn't the line? - You must say, "He's not a fool."

431
00:15:59,710 --> 00:16:01,780
- It's not, "He's a fool"? - If you say that, it's wrong.

432
00:16:01,850 --> 00:16:04,420
- All right. We'll wrap up here. - What?

433
00:16:05,590 --> 00:16:06,750
Gosh, we failed this mission.

434
00:16:06,750 --> 00:16:08,920
Four of your names must go on the roulette.

435
00:16:08,920 --> 00:16:10,290
You can decide the names among yourselves.

436
00:16:10,290 --> 00:16:12,230
Put the name tags of people who made the most mistakes.

437
00:16:12,230 --> 00:16:14,130
- No. - But they could be ghosts.

438
00:16:14,130 --> 00:16:16,400
- We should exclude ghosts. - Right.

439
00:16:16,660 --> 00:16:19,070
I haven't gotten a single part wrong so far.

440
00:16:19,070 --> 00:16:20,200
Okay, let's put his name up.

441
00:16:20,200 --> 00:16:21,500
- Me too. - I was never wrong.

442
00:16:21,500 --> 00:16:23,170
- I'm not a ghost. - She's not a ghost either.

443
00:16:23,170 --> 00:16:25,040
- We can put up your name too. - It's not me.

444
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:26,870
- It's not me. - Let's put her name up.

445
00:16:26,870 --> 00:16:27,910
- It's not me. - Let's do that.

446
00:16:27,910 --> 00:16:29,910
Guys, trust me and put my name up.

447
00:16:29,910 --> 00:16:31,910
- Not him. - Not him.

448
00:16:31,910 --> 00:16:33,210
- We shouldn't trust him. - Not him.

449
00:16:33,280 --> 00:16:34,980
When I say that it's not me, I'm telling the truth.

450
00:16:34,980 --> 00:16:37,020
I can vouch for him.

451
00:16:37,020 --> 00:16:39,190
Bo Ra, this is only your second time here.

452
00:16:39,190 --> 00:16:40,350
Right.

453
00:16:40,350 --> 00:16:41,990
- You don't know him. - We shouldn't put his name up.

454
00:16:41,990 --> 00:16:43,390
- We should never do that. - He's right.

455
00:16:43,390 --> 00:16:44,760
- Not him. - It's really not me.

456
00:16:44,760 --> 00:16:46,560
- Be quiet. - We have no one else to put up.

457
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:47,860
- Why should I be quiet? - How many times...

458
00:16:47,860 --> 00:16:49,160
have you deceived me?

459
00:16:49,160 --> 00:16:50,660
Several times.

460
00:16:51,100 --> 00:16:52,700
How many times have you deceived me?

461
00:16:52,700 --> 00:16:54,270
Several times.

462
00:16:55,070 --> 00:16:56,500
- Is he crazy? - Yes, I've lied to you before.

463
00:16:56,500 --> 00:16:57,740
You have, haven't you?

464
00:16:58,410 --> 00:16:59,470
Come on.

465
00:16:59,570 --> 00:17:01,540
- After today's show, - Don't forget that.

466
00:17:01,540 --> 00:17:03,480
Mr. Kim...

467
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:04,880
- "Mr. Kim"? - Yes.

468
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:06,810
- If I'm not a ghost... - He's acting like a stranger.

469
00:17:07,010 --> 00:17:09,180
- Are you no longer friends? - He's acting like a stranger.

470
00:17:09,180 --> 00:17:10,720
- He has. - If I'm not a ghost,

471
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:12,390
you better apologize to me, Mr. Kim.

472
00:17:12,390 --> 00:17:13,720
- What? - Yes, you, Mr. Kim.

473
00:17:13,720 --> 00:17:15,390
Fine, I will.

474
00:17:15,390 --> 00:17:16,660
But you better apologize...

475
00:17:16,660 --> 00:17:18,360
- for all the times you've lied. - Don't address me like that.

476
00:17:19,160 --> 00:17:21,800
- Where are your manners? - Don't address you like that?

477
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:23,700
Don't address you like that?

478
00:17:23,700 --> 00:17:25,170
- Okay. - I'm a grown man.

479
00:17:25,170 --> 00:17:26,370
I want my share of the restaurant's money...

480
00:17:26,370 --> 00:17:27,640
by tomorrow.

481
00:17:28,440 --> 00:17:29,940
I want my share of the restaurant's money...

482
00:17:29,940 --> 00:17:30,970
by tomorrow.

483
00:17:32,340 --> 00:17:33,540
Hurry!

484
00:17:33,940 --> 00:17:35,880
- He's looking down on me! - Hey.

485
00:17:35,880 --> 00:17:37,810
- He's mad at you. - Mr. Kim.

486
00:17:37,810 --> 00:17:39,810
We're almost there. Hang in there.

487
00:17:39,810 --> 00:17:41,680
- Haha, I'll take his spot. - You little...

488
00:17:41,680 --> 00:17:45,950
- He'll take the spot. - He'll take the spot.

489
00:17:46,220 --> 00:17:48,090
Just go home.

490
00:17:49,060 --> 00:17:51,390
- Just go home on time. - I'll take his spot.

491
00:17:51,390 --> 00:17:52,990
- Gosh. - Or how about this?

492
00:17:52,990 --> 00:17:55,000
Since So Min and I are the least suspicious ones,

493
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:56,830
- should we pick one? - Sure, that'll be better.

494
00:17:56,830 --> 00:17:58,670
- Right, pick one. - We'll pick...

495
00:17:58,670 --> 00:18:00,230
- someone else. - Okay.

496
00:18:00,230 --> 00:18:04,310
- I'll pick Suk Jin. - Okay.

497
00:18:04,310 --> 00:18:07,070
- He's the least likely to be one. - It's really not me. Good choice.

498
00:18:07,140 --> 00:18:08,310
I pick Se Chan.

499
00:18:08,310 --> 00:18:09,580
All right.

500
00:18:09,580 --> 00:18:11,310
- I pick him. - We can trust Se Chan.

501
00:18:11,310 --> 00:18:14,220
It'd be crazy if the ghosts were in this group.

502
00:18:14,680 --> 00:18:17,080
That would be insane.

503
00:18:17,220 --> 00:18:18,520
This is too confusing.

504
00:18:18,890 --> 00:18:20,820
- Me too. - I have no idea.

505
00:18:20,820 --> 00:18:21,890
It's confusing.

506
00:18:23,660 --> 00:18:24,730
What is this?

507
00:18:24,730 --> 00:18:26,490
- It's... - They're velcro balls.

508
00:18:26,660 --> 00:18:29,460
- What are the balls for? - Maybe we need to hit something.

509
00:18:29,700 --> 00:18:31,070
This looks like fun.

510
00:18:31,130 --> 00:18:32,900
We'll be using those cups.

511
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:34,340
Okay, that's nice.

512
00:18:34,370 --> 00:18:36,470
- I know this. - I really like this game.

513
00:18:36,570 --> 00:18:39,740
If you win, you'll be able to pick a name and get a meal card.

514
00:18:39,740 --> 00:18:41,410
It's called Upgrade Go! Stop!

515
00:18:42,840 --> 00:18:44,910
- Meal card? Nice. - Meal card?

516
00:18:45,110 --> 00:18:48,180
You'll be divided into groups of 4 and 5.

517
00:18:48,180 --> 00:18:49,220
4 and 5?

518
00:18:49,220 --> 00:18:52,290
The Money and Chance Card Zones are on the table.

519
00:18:52,290 --> 00:18:53,820
For the Money Zone,

520
00:18:53,820 --> 00:18:57,520
there are cups ranging from 1 to 5 dollars and 2 duds.

521
00:18:57,520 --> 00:18:58,660
There are duds as well.

522
00:18:58,660 --> 00:19:00,590
After each round,

523
00:19:00,590 --> 00:19:03,830
the winning team can open as many cups as they like.

524
00:19:03,830 --> 00:19:05,370
The losing team has...

525
00:19:05,370 --> 00:19:06,900
- only one chance. - I see.

526
00:19:06,900 --> 00:19:08,940
If you open a cup and there's money,

527
00:19:08,940 --> 00:19:11,410
you'll be given that much money and have the choice to move on.

528
00:19:11,410 --> 00:19:15,280
If you get a dud, all your money will disappear.

529
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:17,650
For the Chance Zone, there are 10 chance cards.

530
00:19:17,650 --> 00:19:20,010
For every round, each team must open the cups once.

531
00:19:20,010 --> 00:19:21,480
The winning team will be offered...

532
00:19:21,480 --> 00:19:22,880
7 favorable ones and 3 unfavorable ones.

533
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:24,390
The losing team will be offered...

534
00:19:24,390 --> 00:19:25,920
3 favorable ones and 7 unfavorable ones.

535
00:19:25,920 --> 00:19:28,090
You'll pick out of these choices.

536
00:19:28,090 --> 00:19:29,090
Those are the probabilities.

537
00:19:29,090 --> 00:19:30,590
There will be a total of three rounds.

538
00:19:30,590 --> 00:19:32,130
The team with the highest score will win.

539
00:19:32,130 --> 00:19:34,600
The winning team will pick four names from the losing team...

540
00:19:34,600 --> 00:19:36,300
and attach them to the roulette.

541
00:19:36,830 --> 00:19:40,930
After this game, you will be able to eat with the money you've saved,

542
00:19:40,930 --> 00:19:43,540
so try to save up as much as possible.

543
00:19:44,070 --> 00:19:45,970
Let's split into two teams now.

544
00:19:45,970 --> 00:19:47,570
Your teammates matter.

545
00:19:47,570 --> 00:19:48,680
We should avoid the ghosts.

546
00:19:48,680 --> 00:19:50,240
Let's use spoons.

547
00:19:52,110 --> 00:19:53,150
Take them out.

548
00:19:54,280 --> 00:19:55,950
Here are the rules.

549
00:19:55,950 --> 00:19:57,380
I will tell you the rules...

550
00:19:57,380 --> 00:19:59,890
of Ball Touch Out, the game we'll play beforehand.

551
00:20:00,020 --> 00:20:01,520
- Ball Touch? - Ball Touch Out?

552
00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:04,260
One member from each team will wear a velcro suit.

553
00:20:04,260 --> 00:20:06,590
For one minute, you will throw the balls toward your opponent.

554
00:20:06,590 --> 00:20:09,060
Whoever sticks the most balls on your opponent wins.

555
00:20:09,060 --> 00:20:12,330
You may not remove any balls that are on your body.

556
00:20:12,330 --> 00:20:14,300
Pick a member and wear the suit.

557
00:20:14,300 --> 00:20:15,570
Bo Ra, you should do it.

558
00:20:15,570 --> 00:20:17,710
Then we'll pick So Min.

559
00:20:17,770 --> 00:20:19,840
It's So Min versus Bo Ra.

560
00:20:19,910 --> 00:20:21,310
- I'm curious. - This is...

561
00:20:21,310 --> 00:20:23,310
a match between two crazies.

562
00:20:25,210 --> 00:20:28,320
Why are they taking their clothes off?

563
00:20:28,550 --> 00:20:30,780
- What's with her lips? - What's wrong with them?

564
00:20:30,780 --> 00:20:32,790
Stop the music.

565
00:20:33,020 --> 00:20:34,790
- Look at their gazes. - Good luck!

566
00:20:34,860 --> 00:20:36,360
Look at them.

567
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:38,160
You must win.

568
00:20:38,790 --> 00:20:40,390
Look at them.

569
00:20:40,390 --> 00:20:41,860
It's a match between the crazies.

570
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,170
- They'll be fighting each other. - They're so weird.

571
00:20:46,330 --> 00:20:47,740
It's a match between the senior crazy...

572
00:20:47,740 --> 00:20:49,140
- and a junior crazy. - You're right.

573
00:20:49,300 --> 00:20:50,500
Look at them.

574
00:20:50,600 --> 00:20:51,810
Why would you do that?

575
00:20:51,810 --> 00:20:53,010
Look at them.

576
00:20:53,010 --> 00:20:54,610
Why would you do that?

577
00:20:54,780 --> 00:20:55,810
They look like penguins.

578
00:20:57,110 --> 00:20:59,380
Get ready, set, go.

579
00:21:01,450 --> 00:21:02,650
Throw it at her.

580
00:21:03,250 --> 00:21:04,650
Throw it now.

581
00:21:04,950 --> 00:21:09,460
- Good job. - Dodge.

582
00:21:09,690 --> 00:21:12,190
- Hey, don't get them on you! - You shouldn't get them on you!

583
00:21:12,260 --> 00:21:14,530
- Good job. - Dodge.

584
00:21:14,530 --> 00:21:16,930
- Hey, don't get them on you! - You shouldn't get them on you!

585
00:21:16,930 --> 00:21:18,770
Don't get the balls on yourself.

586
00:21:19,100 --> 00:21:20,500
Throw!

587
00:21:20,500 --> 00:21:22,300
- Good. - You need to keep throwing.

588
00:21:23,070 --> 00:21:24,710
Keep throwing them.

589
00:21:28,140 --> 00:21:29,510
You need to keep throwing.

590
00:21:31,150 --> 00:21:34,250
- You look cool. - Good.

591
00:21:34,380 --> 00:21:36,080
You look like Spider-Man.

592
00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:37,220
Dodge!

593
00:21:37,220 --> 00:21:39,120
Don't show her your back!

594
00:21:39,190 --> 00:21:40,620
- Bo Ra! - Dodge!

595
00:21:40,620 --> 00:21:42,590
- Dodge! - Why are you so bad at throwing?

596
00:21:42,590 --> 00:21:43,590
Dodge!

597
00:21:43,590 --> 00:21:45,430
She's just full of passion.

598
00:21:46,630 --> 00:21:48,130
- So Min is doing well. - What are you doing?

599
00:21:48,230 --> 00:21:50,830
- What is she doing? - Why are you so bad at this?

600
00:21:50,830 --> 00:21:52,070
What are you doing?

601
00:21:52,070 --> 00:21:53,800
She's doing nothing well!

602
00:21:54,670 --> 00:21:55,900
What have you done?

603
00:21:57,940 --> 00:21:59,810
- Isn't she... - Come on.

604
00:21:59,810 --> 00:22:01,140
a ghost?

605
00:22:01,140 --> 00:22:03,380
- She only has passion. - What were you doing?

606
00:22:03,380 --> 00:22:04,650
You did well.

607
00:22:04,650 --> 00:22:05,880
- Good job. - You did well.

608
00:22:05,880 --> 00:22:07,180
I'm not a ghost.

609
00:22:07,310 --> 00:22:08,850
- I'm really not. - Good work.

610
00:22:08,850 --> 00:22:10,450
You did so well.

611
00:22:10,620 --> 00:22:11,890
So Min wins.

612
00:22:11,890 --> 00:22:14,690
I can't believe I beat someone. It's unbelievable.

613
00:22:17,160 --> 00:22:18,590
Is she dying?

614
00:22:20,760 --> 00:22:22,100
Is she dying?

615
00:22:22,100 --> 00:22:24,200
- Are you okay? - Are you okay?

616
00:22:24,970 --> 00:22:26,130
She's exhausted.

617
00:22:26,130 --> 00:22:27,530
I'm too old for this.

618
00:22:27,630 --> 00:22:29,200
So Min's team...

619
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:31,410
will start with the Money Zone.

620
00:22:31,410 --> 00:22:32,640
Money Zone.

621
00:22:32,840 --> 00:22:33,910
This is important.

622
00:22:34,540 --> 00:22:36,310
We need to eat at all costs.

623
00:22:36,410 --> 00:22:37,850
I hope you get a dud on your first opening.

624
00:22:37,980 --> 00:22:39,410
From 1 to 10.

625
00:22:39,410 --> 00:22:40,550
Choose whichever you want.

626
00:22:40,550 --> 00:22:41,550
- I'll do it. - You do it.

627
00:22:41,680 --> 00:22:42,850
All right.

628
00:22:42,850 --> 00:22:44,620
- Trust your gut. - Choose whichever.

629
00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:46,150
Number nine.

630
00:22:46,890 --> 00:22:48,420
Number nine.

631
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:50,590
- I doubt it'd be a dud. - Me too.

632
00:22:52,390 --> 00:22:53,590
I hope you get a dud.

633
00:22:55,630 --> 00:22:57,000
- I hope you get a dud. - One dollar.

634
00:22:58,100 --> 00:22:59,870
- 1 dollar. - Do it 1 more time.

635
00:23:00,200 --> 00:23:01,570
- Do it one more time. - Again?

636
00:23:01,570 --> 00:23:03,240
- Go, Ji Hyo, go! - Jae Suk.

637
00:23:04,710 --> 00:23:06,540
- Okay! - That's three dollars in total.

638
00:23:06,540 --> 00:23:08,110
- Pick another cup. - Pick another cup.

639
00:23:08,110 --> 00:23:09,740
- You're such scaredy-cats. - No.

640
00:23:09,740 --> 00:23:11,380
- Come on. - Let me be!

641
00:23:11,380 --> 00:23:12,850
- Don't. - Let's do it again!

642
00:23:12,850 --> 00:23:14,480
- Don't. - Let's do it again.

643
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:16,050
Go. Let's go.

644
00:23:16,050 --> 00:23:17,120
- Let's do it again. - Do it.

645
00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:18,790
- Jae Suk. - Just trust me.

646
00:23:18,820 --> 00:23:20,620
- Let's go. - Let's go. Don't be scared.

647
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:21,790
1, 2...

648
00:23:26,390 --> 00:23:27,790
- 1, 2. Okay. - All right.

649
00:23:27,790 --> 00:23:29,530
Six dollars. Okay.

650
00:23:30,130 --> 00:23:31,400
That's six dollars.

651
00:23:31,400 --> 00:23:32,800
- Let's do it again! - No, don't.

652
00:23:32,800 --> 00:23:34,740
No, not this time.

653
00:23:34,740 --> 00:23:36,940
- That one's too dangerous. - I agree.

654
00:23:37,500 --> 00:23:39,340
What can we have for six dollars?

655
00:23:39,610 --> 00:23:41,280
We can have stir-fried rice.

656
00:23:41,280 --> 00:23:43,310
- Do you want to stop or continue? - Let's stop.

657
00:23:43,510 --> 00:23:44,910
Let's just stop here.

658
00:23:44,950 --> 00:23:46,110
Let's eat.

659
00:23:46,110 --> 00:23:47,380
One serving is not enough.

660
00:23:47,380 --> 00:23:49,420
- We got six dollars. - We have the chance cards too.

661
00:23:49,420 --> 00:23:50,520
- Let's go. - Again?

662
00:23:50,520 --> 00:23:52,790
- We have the chance cards too. - Let's go.

663
00:23:54,390 --> 00:23:55,590
- We have the chance cards too. - Let's do it.

664
00:23:55,820 --> 00:23:58,290
- Okay! - Okay!

665
00:23:58,290 --> 00:23:59,730
Let's stop here.

666
00:24:01,090 --> 00:24:02,460
- Let's stop here. - Let's do that.

667
00:24:02,460 --> 00:24:03,960
- Let's try it one more time. - Come on.

668
00:24:03,960 --> 00:24:05,100
- I pick this. - Please!

669
00:24:05,100 --> 00:24:07,100
- Don't be so reckless. - Let's do this!

670
00:24:07,100 --> 00:24:09,040
- What's gotten into him? - Don't do this.

671
00:24:09,040 --> 00:24:10,600
He's a gambler.

672
00:24:12,110 --> 00:24:13,270
Let's go.

673
00:24:16,980 --> 00:24:19,210
- Let's just eat now. - Do it one more time.

674
00:24:19,210 --> 00:24:20,950
- Jae Suk, let's stop. - Let's stop.

675
00:24:20,950 --> 00:24:22,050
- Let's stop. - Okay.

676
00:24:22,050 --> 00:24:23,750
You can have sweet and sour pork if you have one more dollar.

677
00:24:23,750 --> 00:24:25,220
- No, let's move on. - Let's move on.

678
00:24:25,220 --> 00:24:26,450
I'll move on.

679
00:24:26,450 --> 00:24:28,090
- So you've stopped? - Yes.

680
00:24:28,190 --> 00:24:30,720
The losing team can pick only once.

681
00:24:31,730 --> 00:24:34,090
- This is stressful. - Pick from the untouched ones.

682
00:24:34,490 --> 00:24:35,630
Or number three...

683
00:24:36,300 --> 00:24:37,970
- How about this one? - Pick this one.

684
00:24:37,970 --> 00:24:39,030
I agree with Suk Jin.

685
00:24:39,030 --> 00:24:40,370
- Are you sure? - Yes.

686
00:24:40,370 --> 00:24:42,670
- It doesn't feel right. - It doesn't.

687
00:24:42,670 --> 00:24:44,200
- All right, let's go. - Really?

688
00:24:44,200 --> 00:24:45,340
- Go. - Try it.

689
00:24:45,340 --> 00:24:46,910
- I'll get five dollars. - Pick that one.

690
00:24:53,650 --> 00:24:54,680
- 3 dollars. - 3 dollars.

691
00:24:55,850 --> 00:24:57,080
That wasn't too bad.

692
00:24:57,080 --> 00:24:58,990
The winning team will move onto the Chance Card Zone.

693
00:24:58,990 --> 00:25:00,420
- Let's go. - You get the good one.

694
00:25:00,420 --> 00:25:02,320
There are 7 favorable ones and 3 unfavorable ones.

695
00:25:02,320 --> 00:25:03,860
The losing team will get a bad probability...

696
00:25:03,860 --> 00:25:05,760
with 7 unfavorable ones and 3 favorable ones.

697
00:25:05,830 --> 00:25:06,930
Who knows what'll happen?

698
00:25:06,930 --> 00:25:08,160
- All right. - Okay.

699
00:25:08,460 --> 00:25:09,530
- Number 10? - Number 10.

700
00:25:09,530 --> 00:25:11,370
- Why are you so reckless? - Why are you so rash?

701
00:25:11,370 --> 00:25:12,730
- You're scaring me. - Don't worry.

702
00:25:14,370 --> 00:25:16,670
There are 7 favorable ones and 3 unfavorable ones.

703
00:25:19,410 --> 00:25:22,410
"You will obtain the money the other team won this round."

704
00:25:23,740 --> 00:25:24,880
We got it.

705
00:25:26,210 --> 00:25:27,380
They'll be getting our money?

706
00:25:27,380 --> 00:25:28,680
Good work!

707
00:25:28,680 --> 00:25:30,050
They'll get our three dollars?

708
00:25:30,050 --> 00:25:31,490
We can pick a good one too.

709
00:25:31,490 --> 00:25:33,220
- We can pick a good one as well. - You're right.

710
00:25:33,220 --> 00:25:35,220
- We can pick the same one. - Right.

711
00:25:35,220 --> 00:25:36,790
- We can pick the same one. - Then we'll get all the money.

712
00:25:36,790 --> 00:25:38,790
- Right. - The best chance card is...

713
00:25:38,790 --> 00:25:40,860
- switching the amount of money. - Okay!

714
00:25:41,400 --> 00:25:43,400
- I'll pick number one. - Okay, do it.

715
00:25:43,630 --> 00:25:45,230
- Here I go. - Don't hesitate.

716
00:25:45,230 --> 00:25:47,370
We could be extremely lucky and get that card.

717
00:25:47,370 --> 00:25:48,770
1, 2, 3.

718
00:25:48,900 --> 00:25:51,540
- It's a good one. - "Open another money cup."

719
00:25:51,770 --> 00:25:53,210
- That's good too. - That one.

720
00:25:53,210 --> 00:25:54,910
- That's good too. - He's right.

721
00:25:54,940 --> 00:25:56,680
- Let it be a dud. - Let it be a dud.

722
00:25:56,780 --> 00:25:58,880
I think the ones that haven't been touched will have five dollars.

723
00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:00,210
How about this last one?

724
00:26:00,380 --> 00:26:02,080
How about number four?

725
00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:03,350
"Four" also means death, and we will survive.

726
00:26:03,350 --> 00:26:04,990
- Number four. - Let's do it!

727
00:26:04,990 --> 00:26:06,350
- 1, 2, 3. - Let's go!

728
00:26:10,160 --> 00:26:11,790
Who picked this one?

729
00:26:11,790 --> 00:26:15,000
Why did you pick 4 instead of 6?

730
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:16,200
That's grand.

731
00:26:17,560 --> 00:26:19,130
If we go first next, we can pick from that pile.

732
00:26:19,130 --> 00:26:20,130
Right.

733
00:26:20,130 --> 00:26:21,770
- Exactly. - I can't believe it was a dud.

734
00:26:21,770 --> 00:26:24,470
It's time for the second round. Please get ready.

735
00:26:24,470 --> 00:26:27,470
Haha's representing, right?

736
00:26:27,470 --> 00:26:29,510
- Then it should be me. - Really?

737
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:33,410
I'll end him.

738
00:26:35,180 --> 00:26:37,820
Aim mostly for his face. Haha, take off your glasses.

739
00:26:37,820 --> 00:26:40,890
You're done for now. Serves you right for being cheeky on the bus.

740
00:26:40,890 --> 00:26:42,990
Jong Kook doesn't even care about the game.

741
00:26:42,990 --> 00:26:45,260
How he can hurt you is his number one focus.

742
00:26:45,260 --> 00:26:48,300
Haha, I guess it's up to you to survive.

743
00:26:49,760 --> 00:26:50,900
There's nothing we can do.

744
00:26:51,970 --> 00:26:53,870
Mr. Kim, wait.

745
00:26:54,030 --> 00:26:55,040
Mr. Kim?

746
00:26:55,040 --> 00:26:57,400
If you want to live, just stayed turned around.

747
00:26:57,670 --> 00:26:59,670
Curl into a ball when the game begins.

748
00:26:59,670 --> 00:27:01,640
- Just stay curled up. - Protect your face.

749
00:27:01,640 --> 00:27:03,680
- It's how you can survive. - Haha, don't let him win.

750
00:27:03,680 --> 00:27:05,250
- Show him what you've got. - Ready,

751
00:27:05,410 --> 00:27:06,480
get set...

752
00:27:14,150 --> 00:27:15,260
This is insane!

753
00:27:17,960 --> 00:27:20,360
- Haha, throw yours too. - Gosh!

754
00:27:25,500 --> 00:27:26,530
Hey!

755
00:27:34,010 --> 00:27:35,040
Jong Kook...

756
00:27:35,940 --> 00:27:37,180
What on earth is this?

757
00:27:37,310 --> 00:27:39,180
He's like a mad man.

758
00:27:51,290 --> 00:27:52,990
- Gosh. - Oh, no!

759
00:27:56,630 --> 00:27:57,730
He won.

760
00:27:59,570 --> 00:28:01,300
- Haha lost. - 4, 3,

761
00:28:01,570 --> 00:28:03,470
2, 1.

762
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:05,740
It's over.

763
00:28:06,970 --> 00:28:09,580
- Hold on. - You idiot!

764
00:28:09,580 --> 00:28:11,480
- I got hit in the face. - You moron.

765
00:28:11,480 --> 00:28:13,050
Finally, I feel better.

766
00:28:13,210 --> 00:28:14,480
Congratulations.

767
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:16,620
Jong Kook, you seem at ease now.

768
00:28:16,950 --> 00:28:18,520
- We won. - There's no doubt about it.

769
00:28:18,520 --> 00:28:21,020
- It was terrifying. - You idiot.

770
00:28:21,020 --> 00:28:23,190
- Gosh. - Jong Kook wins.

771
00:28:23,790 --> 00:28:25,030
It really hurt.

772
00:28:25,160 --> 00:28:28,160
- All right, let's do this. - Let's get ourselves some money.

773
00:28:28,360 --> 00:28:30,130
We should start with the dud pile.

774
00:28:30,130 --> 00:28:31,300
Right, we should.

775
00:28:31,300 --> 00:28:34,070
If this one's a dud too, then the rest will be...

776
00:28:34,070 --> 00:28:35,370
- Yes, money. - It'll be money underneath.

777
00:28:35,370 --> 00:28:37,100
Just get a dud and be done with it.

778
00:28:37,100 --> 00:28:38,870
Get another dud.

779
00:28:38,870 --> 00:28:40,570
- Get another dud. - Get another dud.

780
00:28:40,570 --> 00:28:43,080
- But another dud... - I doubt it.

781
00:28:43,640 --> 00:28:44,680
- Let's do it. - Just go for it.

782
00:28:44,680 --> 00:28:46,410
Go for it. It's highly unlikely.

783
00:28:46,410 --> 00:28:47,980
- Of course. - Here we go.

784
00:28:47,980 --> 00:28:49,820
- It won't be another dud. - 1, 2, 3.

785
00:28:56,720 --> 00:28:59,330
- What did you do? - Such mind games!

786
00:28:59,360 --> 00:29:00,760
- We can select that pile now. - Exactly.

787
00:29:00,760 --> 00:29:02,360
- That's our target. - Okay.

788
00:29:02,360 --> 00:29:05,170
- Let's choose that pile. - They'll go for all of this now.

789
00:29:05,170 --> 00:29:06,470
- We only get one try. - Only one.

790
00:29:06,470 --> 00:29:07,630
- I see. - It's our turn now.

791
00:29:07,630 --> 00:29:09,940
- The losing team can choose one. - That pile, Jae Suk.

792
00:29:09,940 --> 00:29:12,170
It already had two duds, so go for it.

793
00:29:13,240 --> 00:29:14,840
Five dollars!

794
00:29:14,840 --> 00:29:16,480
- Five dollars. - No way.

795
00:29:16,480 --> 00:29:18,910
- You now have 21 dollars. - Nice!

796
00:29:18,910 --> 00:29:20,650
I can't believe you stacked them up this way.

797
00:29:20,650 --> 00:29:21,980
You can pick a chance card now.

798
00:29:21,980 --> 00:29:23,550
There's one that'll let us swap our balance.

799
00:29:23,550 --> 00:29:24,920
- That's right. - Let's swap our balance.

800
00:29:24,920 --> 00:29:26,850
Jong Kook, seven of these will benefit us.

801
00:29:26,920 --> 00:29:28,190
Choose the swap. Number eight?

802
00:29:28,190 --> 00:29:30,060
- Do we have 21 dollars? - What is it?

803
00:29:31,060 --> 00:29:32,090
What is it?

804
00:29:33,530 --> 00:29:34,900
You should've thought it over.

805
00:29:35,100 --> 00:29:37,200
- They chose but failed. - They chose a bad one.

806
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:39,770
"Coin flip. Guess it wrong and you'll lose 10 dollars."

807
00:29:39,770 --> 00:29:41,470
- 10 dollars? - You'll lose 10 dollars.

808
00:29:41,470 --> 00:29:42,770
- 10 dollars? - But we don't have any money.

809
00:29:42,770 --> 00:29:43,770
Will our balance be minus 10 dollars then?

810
00:29:43,770 --> 00:29:45,540
How can you pick a bad chance card?

811
00:29:45,540 --> 00:29:48,110
What's the point in winning the game then?

812
00:29:48,310 --> 00:29:50,640
What's the point when things will get worse for us?

813
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:53,180
Guess it wrong and you'll lose 10 dollars.

814
00:29:53,180 --> 00:29:55,050
- What's heads? - The one with the crane.

815
00:29:55,050 --> 00:29:57,150
- The number will be tails. - We'll just have to get it right.

816
00:29:57,150 --> 00:29:59,290
- Guess it right and we're good. - Do we begin?

817
00:29:59,550 --> 00:30:00,550
Here we go.

818
00:30:01,350 --> 00:30:02,360
Heads!

819
00:30:03,090 --> 00:30:04,090
Heads!

820
00:30:04,090 --> 00:30:06,360
- It was kind of obvious. - It's tails.

821
00:30:06,360 --> 00:30:07,930
- I know what it is. - Tails.

822
00:30:07,930 --> 00:30:09,300
- I agree. - Tails?

823
00:30:09,300 --> 00:30:10,660
It twirled three times, so tails.

824
00:30:10,660 --> 00:30:12,170
- The crane is heads, right? - Yes.

825
00:30:12,170 --> 00:30:14,270
I'll let you see then. You called tails.

826
00:30:15,700 --> 00:30:16,740
Tails.

827
00:30:20,110 --> 00:30:21,140
- Tails. - Tails.

828
00:30:22,310 --> 00:30:23,310
Okay.

829
00:30:23,680 --> 00:30:25,880
- What a relief. - It twirled three times.

830
00:30:25,880 --> 00:30:27,480
We still don't have any money though.

831
00:30:27,480 --> 00:30:29,250
You'll now choose a chance card from the bad zone.

832
00:30:29,250 --> 00:30:31,080
- We can pick a good one. - Sure we can.

833
00:30:31,080 --> 00:30:32,350
Choose one.

834
00:30:32,350 --> 00:30:33,350
Please let it be a bad one.

835
00:30:33,350 --> 00:30:34,750
- The chances are low. - A bad one...

836
00:30:34,750 --> 00:30:36,520
I think Jae Suk should choose.

837
00:30:36,520 --> 00:30:38,760
- Me? - You're extremely lucky today.

838
00:30:38,760 --> 00:30:40,160
- But... - I think he's the ghost.

839
00:30:40,160 --> 00:30:42,560
He's been trying to sabotage us, but that's backfiring on him.

840
00:30:42,560 --> 00:30:44,260
- Really? - Makes sense.

841
00:30:44,260 --> 00:30:45,770
He's too lucky today.

842
00:30:45,770 --> 00:30:48,100
All right, here we go.

843
00:30:52,910 --> 00:30:57,280
"Double your money. Multiply your total by two times."

844
00:30:57,280 --> 00:30:58,680
See?

845
00:30:58,680 --> 00:31:00,380
- See what I mean? - Jae Suk!

846
00:31:00,380 --> 00:31:02,280
He must be the ghost.

847
00:31:02,280 --> 00:31:04,450
- He must be. - I think he is too.

848
00:31:04,450 --> 00:31:06,420
He's only picking the good ones...

849
00:31:06,420 --> 00:31:07,520
because he's trying to sabotage them.

850
00:31:07,520 --> 00:31:09,920
They now have 42 dollars.

851
00:31:10,820 --> 00:31:13,460
You two are...

852
00:31:13,460 --> 00:31:15,030
- the ghosts. - What?

853
00:31:15,030 --> 00:31:16,400
- The ghosts. - What?

854
00:31:18,900 --> 00:31:20,630
- Let's do this! - Just do it.

855
00:31:21,800 --> 00:31:23,640
- Go? - Let's go.

856
00:31:23,640 --> 00:31:25,570
- 3 dollars. - 3 dollars.

857
00:31:26,970 --> 00:31:29,540
"Double your money. Multiply your total by two times."

858
00:31:29,880 --> 00:31:32,610
- See what I mean? - Jae Suk!

859
00:31:32,610 --> 00:31:37,650
- He must be the ghost. - He must be.

860
00:31:39,020 --> 00:31:41,090
They now have 42 dollars.

861
00:31:41,390 --> 00:31:42,520
Why aren't you happy?

862
00:31:42,520 --> 00:31:44,460
- You don't seem thrilled. - I'm flustered, that's all.

863
00:31:44,460 --> 00:31:46,190
- But... - 42 dollars?

864
00:31:46,190 --> 00:31:47,760
I can't believe I chose this.

865
00:31:47,760 --> 00:31:49,030
You have 42 dollars.

866
00:31:50,030 --> 00:31:52,670
In the last round, two from each team will compete.

867
00:31:52,670 --> 00:31:55,070
The team with the least number of balls on them wins.

868
00:31:55,070 --> 00:31:56,340
Who will it be this time?

869
00:31:56,770 --> 00:31:58,570
- You should do it. - Me? Okay.

870
00:31:58,570 --> 00:32:01,070
- Kwang Soo, go ahead. - Okay.

871
00:32:01,070 --> 00:32:02,880
Doesn't that side have more balls?

872
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:04,010
Want some?

873
00:32:06,410 --> 00:32:07,650
That's powerful.

874
00:32:10,080 --> 00:32:11,820
Gosh, this is scary.

875
00:32:12,350 --> 00:32:13,750
Okay, here we go.

876
00:32:15,160 --> 00:32:16,260
Here we go.

877
00:32:16,320 --> 00:32:17,460
We need to win this time.

878
00:32:17,460 --> 00:32:19,560
- Good luck. - You've got this.

879
00:32:19,560 --> 00:32:20,930
- This will be fun. - Get ready.

880
00:32:20,930 --> 00:32:22,300
- Are you ready? - It's a big match.

881
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:26,170
Dodge his and then throw yours.

882
00:32:26,170 --> 00:32:27,470
Why not just throw one now?

883
00:32:27,470 --> 00:32:29,300
- Hey. - What are you doing?

884
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:32,010
Throw them.

885
00:32:32,710 --> 00:32:34,010
- Throw them one at a time. - Hey!

886
00:32:34,010 --> 00:32:35,410
- Don't show your back. - Kwang Soo!

887
00:32:35,410 --> 00:32:37,010
Don't show your back.

888
00:32:39,750 --> 00:32:41,980
- Don't show your back. - Don't show him your back.

889
00:32:46,450 --> 00:32:49,620
- What is this? - Darn!

890
00:32:49,620 --> 00:32:51,660
- Nice. - I can't believe him.

891
00:32:51,660 --> 00:32:54,260
- Kwang Soo, don't show your back. - No!

892
00:32:56,660 --> 00:32:57,660
- He's a ghost. - He is.

893
00:32:57,660 --> 00:32:59,670
You shouldn't show your back.

894
00:32:59,670 --> 00:33:02,000
- He's a ghost. - Your balls are sticking to you.

895
00:33:04,270 --> 00:33:05,570
He has to be the ghost.

896
00:33:05,570 --> 00:33:07,370
- What are you doing? - Stop showing your back.

897
00:33:08,610 --> 00:33:09,780
Are you kidding me?

898
00:33:09,780 --> 00:33:11,210
Unbelievable.

899
00:33:11,310 --> 00:33:13,850
I can't believe this.

900
00:33:13,850 --> 00:33:15,780
- Seriously? - Kwang Soo's a fool.

901
00:33:15,780 --> 00:33:17,150
- Hey. - 10 seconds!

902
00:33:17,150 --> 00:33:18,550
- Why are you being this way? - He's a fool.

903
00:33:18,550 --> 00:33:19,650
Throw them.

904
00:33:19,650 --> 00:33:21,050
Get more on him.

905
00:33:21,450 --> 00:33:22,560
Get more on him.

906
00:33:23,160 --> 00:33:24,820
- Hurry. - Get him!

907
00:33:24,820 --> 00:33:26,160
- This is your chance. - Now!

908
00:33:26,460 --> 00:33:28,830
- Hurry. - Okay, that's it.

909
00:33:28,830 --> 00:33:29,900
- Three... - Hurry.

910
00:33:29,900 --> 00:33:30,930
- Two... - This is your last chance.

911
00:33:30,930 --> 00:33:32,170
- One. - That was the last one.

912
00:33:32,670 --> 00:33:35,240
That was the last one. Wait, it's hard to tell.

913
00:33:35,240 --> 00:33:36,670
- He got the hang of it. - You never know.

914
00:33:36,670 --> 00:33:38,640
- At the last second... - We could've won.

915
00:33:38,640 --> 00:33:40,110
It seems close.

916
00:33:40,110 --> 00:33:42,110
- It seems close. - You never know.

917
00:33:42,110 --> 00:33:43,480
Please...

918
00:33:45,110 --> 00:33:47,180
I have four.

919
00:33:47,410 --> 00:33:49,250
1, 2, 3.

920
00:33:49,250 --> 00:33:50,350
That's eight.

921
00:33:50,650 --> 00:33:51,650
There's 25.

922
00:33:51,650 --> 00:33:53,250
- 25. - 25?

923
00:33:53,250 --> 00:33:54,720
- Yes. - 2, 4,

924
00:33:54,720 --> 00:33:56,260
- 6, 8... - You never know.

925
00:33:57,320 --> 00:34:00,260
- It was a close game. - It seems close.

926
00:34:01,090 --> 00:34:02,730
- Here. - There's 21.

927
00:34:03,330 --> 00:34:05,030
Okay!

928
00:34:06,770 --> 00:34:08,770
- Nice. - Why throw them all at once?

929
00:34:08,770 --> 00:34:10,400
What was that?

930
00:34:10,400 --> 00:34:12,140
- Kwang Soo... - Why did you show your back?

931
00:34:12,140 --> 00:34:14,570
- Exactly. - You should've done this instead.

932
00:34:14,570 --> 00:34:15,880
That's right.

933
00:34:15,980 --> 00:34:17,180
Get ready...

934
00:34:20,580 --> 00:34:22,650
- What on earth? - Nice.

935
00:34:22,920 --> 00:34:24,250
Gosh.

936
00:34:25,250 --> 00:34:26,590
Gosh.

937
00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:30,220
Nice. That's it!

938
00:34:30,260 --> 00:34:31,860
- You're doing great. - Good job.

939
00:34:32,030 --> 00:34:34,130
- Dodge her balls. - You're looking sexy.

940
00:34:34,890 --> 00:34:36,030
That much...

941
00:34:37,160 --> 00:34:39,070
She's covered in balls now.

942
00:34:48,980 --> 00:34:52,280
Why are you sticking more balls on yourself?

943
00:34:52,310 --> 00:34:53,310
Look.

944
00:34:53,310 --> 00:34:55,980
5, 4, 3,

945
00:34:56,020 --> 00:34:57,820
2, 1.

946
00:34:58,450 --> 00:35:00,290
You were extremely sexy just now.

947
00:35:02,490 --> 00:35:04,560
Team Jong Kook is the overall winner.

948
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:06,030
- Okay. - The duds...

949
00:35:06,030 --> 00:35:08,130
- 1 pile had 2 duds. - Which pile is it?

950
00:35:08,130 --> 00:35:10,260
- Was it this one? - The one with 5 dollars.

951
00:35:10,530 --> 00:35:12,670
- Right, this is the one. - Number four.

952
00:35:12,670 --> 00:35:14,170
- Right. - Let's take it all.

953
00:35:14,170 --> 00:35:15,540
- We'll no longer get a dud. - Okay, we've chosen.

954
00:35:15,540 --> 00:35:16,840
- We'll choose. - Here we go.

955
00:35:16,840 --> 00:35:18,810
- Just take them all. - As long as it's not much.

956
00:35:19,840 --> 00:35:21,410
- Gosh. - Two dollars.

957
00:35:21,410 --> 00:35:22,840
- 3 dollars. - 3 dollars.

958
00:35:22,910 --> 00:35:24,640
- 6 dollars. - 6 dollars.

959
00:35:24,740 --> 00:35:26,280
- 4 dollars? That's 10 in total. - 10 dollars.

960
00:35:26,280 --> 00:35:28,010
- 10 dollars? - The total.

961
00:35:28,010 --> 00:35:29,650
- We have 10 dollars in total. - Good.

962
00:35:29,750 --> 00:35:31,520
Pile number four has been depleted.

963
00:35:31,520 --> 00:35:33,090
Number four started with a dud.

964
00:35:33,090 --> 00:35:34,120
I doubt it'll be the same for number five.

965
00:35:34,120 --> 00:35:35,360
Exactly. You're right.

966
00:35:35,360 --> 00:35:36,460
- Really? - It's not possible.

967
00:35:36,460 --> 00:35:38,460
Pile number four started with a dud.

968
00:35:38,460 --> 00:35:39,630
- I'm getting a bad feeling. - Okay?

969
00:35:39,630 --> 00:35:40,660
Let's do this.

970
00:35:41,730 --> 00:35:43,660
- Okay. - We have 11 dollars.

971
00:35:43,660 --> 00:35:45,670
We need more money if we're to beat them.

972
00:35:45,670 --> 00:35:47,000
- Let's keep going. - But if it's a dud...

973
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:48,270
There won't be a dud under the one dollar.

974
00:35:48,270 --> 00:35:49,540
It'd only show up after five dollars.

975
00:35:49,540 --> 00:35:50,840
- I choose this one. - But...

976
00:35:50,840 --> 00:35:53,270
- I have a bad feeling about this. - It's not possible.

977
00:35:53,370 --> 00:35:55,040
- You're wrong. - I get good hunches, don't I?

978
00:35:55,040 --> 00:35:57,980
I doubt the others will start with a dud now.

979
00:35:57,980 --> 00:35:59,850
- We're nervous because it's you. - How about this one?

980
00:36:00,980 --> 00:36:02,080
- Pile number one? - Yes.

981
00:36:02,080 --> 00:36:04,650
There won't be a pile that starts with a dud now.

982
00:36:04,650 --> 00:36:06,450
- There will be at least two. - Exactly.

983
00:36:08,220 --> 00:36:09,460
- Underneath the five dollars. - I agree.

984
00:36:09,460 --> 00:36:10,720
I agree with Suk Jin.

985
00:36:10,720 --> 00:36:12,360
Isn't it more likely to have a dud?

986
00:36:12,360 --> 00:36:13,560
- It won't be a dud. - No way.

987
00:36:13,560 --> 00:36:15,400
- This one! - Okay, let's do this.

988
00:36:18,600 --> 00:36:20,400
- Okay! - Good job.

989
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:21,470
One more?

990
00:36:21,470 --> 00:36:22,670
- Let's do one more. - Let's do one more.

991
00:36:22,670 --> 00:36:23,670
Are you sure?

992
00:36:24,070 --> 00:36:25,640
- Which one? - It's the last one.

993
00:36:26,310 --> 00:36:27,840
- It's three dollars. - We did it.

994
00:36:29,310 --> 00:36:30,480
Let's stop now.

995
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:32,010
- I want to do just one more time. - We have to stop.

996
00:36:32,110 --> 00:36:33,980
I think we'll get five more dollars.

997
00:36:33,980 --> 00:36:35,450
- Keep going. - Let's do just one more.

998
00:36:35,450 --> 00:36:36,880
Okay. Let's do one more.

999
00:36:36,880 --> 00:36:38,790
We might get five more dollars.

1000
00:36:38,790 --> 00:36:41,150
You'll lose all your money.

1001
00:36:41,220 --> 00:36:42,320
It'll be a dud.

1002
00:36:42,760 --> 00:36:46,260
Five dollars!

1003
00:36:48,430 --> 00:36:50,700
- Good job! - We've gained 20 dollars.

1004
00:36:50,700 --> 00:36:51,860
- We've almost caught up. - Let's stop now.

1005
00:36:51,860 --> 00:36:52,870
- Keep going. - Let's stop.

1006
00:36:52,870 --> 00:36:54,470
- We'll stop. - We should control ourselves.

1007
00:36:54,470 --> 00:36:56,870
- Let's control ourselves. - You will stop at only 20 dollars?

1008
00:36:56,870 --> 00:36:59,010
It's the losing team's turn to pick an amount.

1009
00:36:59,840 --> 00:37:01,640
- We're still safe, right? - Yes.

1010
00:37:02,310 --> 00:37:03,480
Pick a dud.

1011
00:37:04,510 --> 00:37:05,680
Pick a dud.

1012
00:37:06,550 --> 00:37:08,210
Is it a dud? I told you.

1013
00:37:08,210 --> 00:37:09,750
- It's the first dud. - Yes.

1014
00:37:09,750 --> 00:37:11,580
We picked a dud in this round.

1015
00:37:12,620 --> 00:37:13,820
We can pick a good chance card.

1016
00:37:14,090 --> 00:37:15,520
Chance cards are more important.

1017
00:37:15,690 --> 00:37:16,920
Pick a good one. Please.

1018
00:37:17,220 --> 00:37:18,690
- It's been going well for us. - It's going well.

1019
00:37:18,690 --> 00:37:20,660
- We've gained 20 dollars. - There are two bad ones left.

1020
00:37:20,660 --> 00:37:21,960
The rest are all good.

1021
00:37:21,960 --> 00:37:23,860
- There are only two bad ones left. - There are only two.

1022
00:37:23,860 --> 00:37:25,160
- I'll choose number 4. - Number 4?

1023
00:37:25,160 --> 00:37:26,300
- Number four again? - Yes.

1024
00:37:26,300 --> 00:37:27,670
Last time, I died. I'm sure I'll live this time.

1025
00:37:27,670 --> 00:37:28,800
1, 2, 3.

1026
00:37:35,110 --> 00:37:36,210
1, 2, 3.

1027
00:37:36,210 --> 00:37:37,580
- Okay! - It's a good one.

1028
00:37:37,980 --> 00:37:41,880
"Swap your amount with the other team."

1029
00:37:42,020 --> 00:37:43,480
- Let's do that. - Let's swap.

1030
00:37:43,480 --> 00:37:45,590
- Let's swap! - Let's swap!

1031
00:37:48,690 --> 00:37:50,120
- Let me see. - See what?

1032
00:37:50,160 --> 00:37:51,660
- Let me see the card. - Come see then.

1033
00:37:51,760 --> 00:37:53,030
Let me see. You're dead meat.

1034
00:37:53,030 --> 00:37:55,090
- It's true. - What are you talking about?

1035
00:37:55,430 --> 00:37:56,500
Can't you read?

1036
00:37:57,430 --> 00:37:59,730
- Can they really swap? - You picked a good one!

1037
00:38:00,900 --> 00:38:02,370
Good job!

1038
00:38:02,370 --> 00:38:05,000
We should have swapped when we had no money.

1039
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:06,570
Still, their amount is more than double what we have.

1040
00:38:06,570 --> 00:38:07,740
Good shot!

1041
00:38:08,270 --> 00:38:09,380
We have 20 dollars now.

1042
00:38:10,210 --> 00:38:11,880
We might be able to swap again.

1043
00:38:11,880 --> 00:38:13,980
- We have a swap card too. - You do.

1044
00:38:13,980 --> 00:38:15,110
They do?

1045
00:38:15,250 --> 00:38:16,820
- But the chances are slim. - No way.

1046
00:38:16,820 --> 00:38:18,380
- That's not going to happen. - It's okay.

1047
00:38:18,580 --> 00:38:20,090
We can swap back.

1048
00:38:20,090 --> 00:38:22,160
- We'll pick a swap card too. - That's unlikely.

1049
00:38:22,160 --> 00:38:23,920
I think I've run out of luck.

1050
00:38:23,920 --> 00:38:26,560
- Just try. - You're a ghost, so it'll be fine.

1051
00:38:27,660 --> 00:38:28,730
You...

1052
00:38:30,100 --> 00:38:32,330
This is frustrating. You're suspecting I'm a ghost.

1053
00:38:32,500 --> 00:38:33,570
You can do this.

1054
00:38:34,300 --> 00:38:35,300
Number eight?

1055
00:38:35,870 --> 00:38:38,770
- You're a ghost, so it'll be fine. - That's unlikely.

1056
00:38:38,770 --> 00:38:40,170
They...

1057
00:38:44,980 --> 00:38:46,380
- "Swap your amount..." - Seriously?

1058
00:38:48,380 --> 00:38:49,580
Seriously?

1059
00:38:50,220 --> 00:38:51,320
- Oh, my. - Oh, my.

1060
00:38:51,320 --> 00:38:53,320
- You did it! - I swear.

1061
00:38:55,560 --> 00:38:57,060
Jae Suk...

1062
00:38:57,320 --> 00:38:58,860
- I didn't expect this. - This is insane.

1063
00:38:58,860 --> 00:38:59,890
What's with you?

1064
00:39:00,260 --> 00:39:02,200
- What's with me? - I didn't...

1065
00:39:02,430 --> 00:39:03,860
I can't believe it.

1066
00:39:03,860 --> 00:39:05,030
A ghost...

1067
00:39:05,030 --> 00:39:06,300
I found a ghost.

1068
00:39:06,330 --> 00:39:07,570
Jae Suk is a ghost.

1069
00:39:07,900 --> 00:39:09,240
This is crazy.

1070
00:39:09,340 --> 00:39:11,470
This is unbelievable. How could he pick that?

1071
00:39:11,470 --> 00:39:15,410
If Jae Suk really is a ghost, he's so unlucky.

1072
00:39:17,480 --> 00:39:19,050
- You're right. - If he really is a ghost...

1073
00:39:19,110 --> 00:39:21,550
- Then he is extremely unlucky. - It's the worst.

1074
00:39:21,550 --> 00:39:22,750
It's the worst.

1075
00:39:22,750 --> 00:39:24,350
I'm shocked.

1076
00:39:24,350 --> 00:39:26,290
Out of the five members on the losing team,

1077
00:39:26,290 --> 00:39:28,520
- choose 4 for the roulette. - 4?

1078
00:39:28,520 --> 00:39:29,960
I think they're all ghosts.

1079
00:39:29,960 --> 00:39:32,260
- Didn't you see how hard I worked? - I'm not a ghost.

1080
00:39:32,260 --> 00:39:33,530
- You saw it, right? - Hey.

1081
00:39:33,790 --> 00:39:35,360
I'm suspecting...

1082
00:39:36,700 --> 00:39:38,870
- Jong Kook, Suk Jin, and Bo Ra. - Why me?

1083
00:39:38,870 --> 00:39:40,200
- I worked so hard. - You're suspicious.

1084
00:39:40,200 --> 00:39:41,700
I kept telling them to stop...

1085
00:39:41,700 --> 00:39:43,640
- when we were picking amounts. - Hey.

1086
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:46,070
- Kwang Soo is suspicious. - Why?

1087
00:39:46,070 --> 00:39:47,240
- He's been acting strange. - No.

1088
00:39:47,240 --> 00:39:49,380
- I was like Jae Suk. - He threw the balls like this.

1089
00:39:49,380 --> 00:39:51,240
I was trying to throw as many balls as possible at once.

1090
00:39:51,710 --> 00:39:53,210
I don't think Se Chan is a ghost.

1091
00:39:53,480 --> 00:39:54,810
Let's choose everyone except Bo Ra.

1092
00:39:54,810 --> 00:39:57,180
- Everyone except Bo Ra, okay? - Okay.

1093
00:39:57,820 --> 00:39:58,890
Everyone except Bo Ra.

1094
00:39:58,890 --> 00:40:01,590
- Why? I'm not a ghost. - Everyone except Bo Ra.

1095
00:40:01,850 --> 00:40:04,890
- Why? I'm not a ghost. - Everyone except Bo Ra.

1096
00:40:05,860 --> 00:40:07,330
Don't put Suk Jin's name on it.

1097
00:40:07,860 --> 00:40:08,930
Kwang Soo...

1098
00:40:08,930 --> 00:40:10,300
It's done.

1099
00:40:12,160 --> 00:40:14,900
- Please choose a dish. - I'm so happy.

1100
00:40:14,900 --> 00:40:17,240
- I choose fried rice. - Jjamppong and fried dumplings.

1101
00:40:17,240 --> 00:40:18,540
That sounds good. I want fried rice.

1102
00:40:18,540 --> 00:40:19,870
Should I have fried rice? It's been a while.

1103
00:40:20,240 --> 00:40:24,040
- I'm craving carbs. - Fried dumplings...

1104
00:40:24,310 --> 00:40:29,480
- Jjamppong has carbs too. - Does anyone want jjajangmyeon?

1105
00:40:29,850 --> 00:40:31,080
I'm craving rice.

1106
00:40:32,950 --> 00:40:34,520
Everything on the menu...

1107
00:40:34,520 --> 00:40:36,160
has carbs.

1108
00:40:37,060 --> 00:40:38,160
I didn't want to reveal this.

1109
00:40:38,160 --> 00:40:40,460
In Vietnam, she said on the street,

1110
00:40:41,160 --> 00:40:44,030
"That hotel must be owned by a Korean."

1111
00:40:44,160 --> 00:40:45,460
Don't say it.

1112
00:40:45,800 --> 00:40:47,600
"It must be owned by Mr. Park Royal."

1113
00:40:48,070 --> 00:40:49,240
It was the Park Royal Hotel,

1114
00:40:49,570 --> 00:40:51,670
and she thought it was owned by Mr. Park Royal.

1115
00:40:51,670 --> 00:40:53,140
It was the Park Royal Hotel.

1116
00:40:53,140 --> 00:40:55,340
And she thought it was owned by Mr. Park Royal.

1117
00:40:56,080 --> 00:40:57,780
This is the truth.

1118
00:40:58,480 --> 00:41:01,150
"Park Royal is a pretty name."

1119
00:41:01,250 --> 00:41:03,580
- "His name is unique. Mr. Park..." - Unbelievable.

1120
00:41:03,780 --> 00:41:05,850
- Mr. Park Royal... It's so funny. - Mr. Park Royal.

1121
00:41:05,990 --> 00:41:07,190
It's unbelievable.

1122
00:41:11,120 --> 00:41:13,460
They've chosen their teams, right?

1123
00:41:13,930 --> 00:41:15,560
Who would choose me after seeing the picture?

1124
00:41:15,560 --> 00:41:16,930
I look like a blue egg.

1125
00:41:16,960 --> 00:41:18,800
Adria Arjona.

1126
00:41:19,030 --> 00:41:20,470
Melanie Laurent.

1127
00:41:20,470 --> 00:41:21,770
Arjona.

1128
00:41:21,930 --> 00:41:24,040
What's up? Ryan Reynolds.

1129
00:41:24,340 --> 00:41:25,910
Your voice is so nice.

1130
00:41:26,140 --> 00:41:27,540
Hi, nice to meet you, and you?

1131
00:41:28,710 --> 00:41:30,080
Hi, nice to meet you, and you?

1132
00:41:31,580 --> 00:41:33,210
- You're good. - What time is it now?

1133
00:41:33,310 --> 00:41:34,710
Fine, thank you, and you?

1134
00:41:35,580 --> 00:41:36,750
They're coming down right now.

1135
00:41:36,850 --> 00:41:37,920
They're coming down.

1136
00:41:37,920 --> 00:41:39,050
Are they really coming?

1137
00:41:39,220 --> 00:41:40,750
Where are they? Are they here?

1138
00:41:40,950 --> 00:41:42,050
Where are they?

1139
00:42:08,780 --> 00:42:09,780
We're no one.

1140
00:42:10,180 --> 00:42:12,550
You see that?

1141
00:42:22,730 --> 00:42:23,830
Let's do this.

1142
00:42:23,930 --> 00:42:25,100
What's up?

1143
00:42:25,300 --> 00:42:27,400
Let's go! Let's do this!

1144
00:42:27,400 --> 00:42:29,470
- Oh, my gosh! - Oh, my gosh!

1145
00:42:29,640 --> 00:42:32,510
- Oh, my gosh! - Oh, my gosh!

1146
00:42:36,880 --> 00:42:38,210
Oh, my gosh, Ryan!

1147
00:42:38,910 --> 00:42:40,050
Hi, Ryan!

1148
00:42:42,380 --> 00:42:43,920
- Get out of his way. - Come here.

1149
00:42:44,020 --> 00:42:45,350
- What's with you? - What are you doing?

1150
00:42:48,290 --> 00:42:49,990
- Giraffe! - "Giraffe"?

1151
00:42:50,420 --> 00:42:51,590
He called me Giraffe.

1152
00:42:52,730 --> 00:42:53,860
Gosh.

1153
00:42:57,560 --> 00:42:59,630
- He called me Giraffe. - Finally,

1154
00:42:59,630 --> 00:43:02,970
Ryan Reynolds, Melanie Laurent,

1155
00:43:02,970 --> 00:43:05,970
and Adria Arjona are with us here.

1156
00:43:11,140 --> 00:43:12,780
- Shall we sit down? - Sure.

1157
00:43:13,110 --> 00:43:15,280
All right, guys. Can I get one more out?

1158
00:43:23,020 --> 00:43:24,560
He's so hyped up.

1159
00:43:25,860 --> 00:43:27,430
He's full of energy.

1160
00:43:27,430 --> 00:43:29,700
He hugged me so tight.

1161
00:43:30,730 --> 00:43:33,030
I'd like to ask the three of them...

1162
00:43:33,030 --> 00:43:36,200
to introduce themselves to our viewers first.

1163
00:43:36,440 --> 00:43:38,900
- Hello, we're excited to be here. - Hi.

1164
00:43:39,070 --> 00:43:42,070
We can't wait to be the show's first human sacrifices.

1165
00:43:48,350 --> 00:43:50,650
Following Ryan,

1166
00:43:50,650 --> 00:43:52,180
let's hear from Adria.

1167
00:43:52,180 --> 00:43:53,820
Hi, how are you?

1168
00:43:53,950 --> 00:43:56,220
It's so nice to be here. Thank you for having us.

1169
00:43:59,230 --> 00:44:01,460
We have Melanie here as well.

1170
00:44:02,060 --> 00:44:04,030
I'm so ready to go.

1171
00:44:04,900 --> 00:44:05,970
Hi.

1172
00:44:07,730 --> 00:44:08,870
All right.

1173
00:44:12,440 --> 00:44:14,240
Their movie will be...

1174
00:44:14,410 --> 00:44:16,240
released soon.

1175
00:44:16,580 --> 00:44:19,150
Can you tell us a bit about your movie?

1176
00:44:19,410 --> 00:44:20,950
The movie "6 Underground"...

1177
00:44:21,480 --> 00:44:24,880
is a giant spectacle action extravaganza...

1178
00:44:24,880 --> 00:44:27,250
for Netflix that we're very excited about.

1179
00:44:27,250 --> 00:44:31,260
It's about six people who fake their own deaths to go off-grid...

1180
00:44:31,260 --> 00:44:33,960
to right some of the greatest wrongs in the world.

1181
00:44:33,960 --> 00:44:36,230
We're especially psyched about it.

1182
00:44:38,060 --> 00:44:39,570
- It sounds so fun. - I can't wait.

1183
00:44:39,570 --> 00:44:40,800
I'll definitely watch it.

1184
00:44:40,970 --> 00:44:42,540
We'll ask each guest...

1185
00:44:42,540 --> 00:44:44,300
a few questions.

1186
00:44:44,500 --> 00:44:47,170
Let's start with Ryan.

1187
00:44:47,640 --> 00:44:49,180
Like he said,

1188
00:44:49,240 --> 00:44:51,240
this is his second time in Korea.

1189
00:44:56,180 --> 00:44:57,950
- Can he read Korean? - I'm reading this right now.

1190
00:44:58,220 --> 00:44:59,820
- It's written in Korean. - No.

1191
00:44:59,820 --> 00:45:00,850
Not that one.

1192
00:45:00,850 --> 00:45:01,950
Let's do this one.

1193
00:45:01,950 --> 00:45:03,820
- Okay. - Let's do this one.

1194
00:45:04,190 --> 00:45:05,990
- He's so funny. - He has a sense of humor.

1195
00:45:06,760 --> 00:45:08,530
Ryan is so funny.

1196
00:45:08,860 --> 00:45:10,100
He has a sense of humor.

1197
00:45:10,100 --> 00:45:11,160
Why are you taking off your pants?

1198
00:45:15,070 --> 00:45:16,340
Oh, I'm sorry.

1199
00:45:16,340 --> 00:45:18,270
I misinterpreted this.

1200
00:45:18,600 --> 00:45:21,510
- I misinterpreted this. - Tell him I have a present for him.

1201
00:45:21,910 --> 00:45:23,110
I have a present for him.

1202
00:45:23,410 --> 00:45:24,480
Ryan.

1203
00:45:29,580 --> 00:45:31,050
He knows it.

1204
00:45:31,120 --> 00:45:32,320
Hold on a second.

1205
00:45:32,450 --> 00:45:34,020
Here...

1206
00:45:34,850 --> 00:45:35,990
Thank you.

1207
00:45:36,090 --> 00:45:37,490
Thank you so much.

1208
00:45:37,860 --> 00:45:39,290
Thank you so much.

1209
00:45:39,730 --> 00:45:42,430
- He's eating it. - He's so good at this.

1210
00:45:42,700 --> 00:45:43,900
Like he said,

1211
00:45:44,030 --> 00:45:46,270
this is his second time in Korea.

1212
00:45:46,430 --> 00:45:48,330
And he promised...

1213
00:45:48,500 --> 00:45:50,770
he'd gulp down a bottle of soju the next time he's in Korea.

1214
00:45:50,770 --> 00:45:51,900
- Really? - Really?

1215
00:45:51,900 --> 00:45:53,010
Oh, my gosh.

1216
00:45:53,010 --> 00:45:54,110
Yes. No problem.

1217
00:45:54,410 --> 00:45:55,880
Sure. I don't mind...

1218
00:45:55,880 --> 00:45:58,140
being legally bonused for the rest of the day.

1219
00:45:58,410 --> 00:45:59,610
What?

1220
00:45:59,710 --> 00:46:01,110
- You're going to drink soju now? - For the rest of the day...

1221
00:46:01,180 --> 00:46:02,280
Sure.

1222
00:46:02,750 --> 00:46:05,220
No problem. I've never in my life said no to alcohol.

1223
00:46:05,220 --> 00:46:06,720
After drinking soju,

1224
00:46:06,720 --> 00:46:08,250
he'll take the whole day off.

1225
00:46:09,260 --> 00:46:11,160
- Ryan is such a good talker. - Seriously.

1226
00:46:11,460 --> 00:46:12,930
- He's so good. - He's so funny.

1227
00:46:12,930 --> 00:46:14,460
Give it up for Ryan!

1228
00:46:15,830 --> 00:46:17,400
Let's ask some questions...

1229
00:46:17,400 --> 00:46:19,630
- to Adria this time. - Yes!

1230
00:46:19,630 --> 00:46:21,670
We want you to imagine yourself as a secret agent...

1231
00:46:21,670 --> 00:46:23,640
and go with your gut feeling.

1232
00:46:23,640 --> 00:46:26,210
Which member looks to be the youngest?

1233
00:46:26,210 --> 00:46:27,570
- The youngest. - Yes.

1234
00:46:28,370 --> 00:46:30,310
Which member looks to be the youngest?

1235
00:46:32,380 --> 00:46:33,480
The youngest?

1236
00:46:34,280 --> 00:46:36,420
I think... Wait, what's her name?

1237
00:46:36,420 --> 00:46:38,120
- Jeon. - Jeon.

1238
00:46:39,150 --> 00:46:41,290
Did I win? Yes? Are you the youngest?

1239
00:46:41,290 --> 00:46:42,960
- Yes. - Yes?

1240
00:46:42,960 --> 00:46:44,860
- Ask how old she thinks So Min is. - How old is she?

1241
00:46:46,930 --> 00:46:48,460
Twenty...

1242
00:46:50,100 --> 00:46:51,260
Seven.

1243
00:46:53,630 --> 00:46:54,630
Really?

1244
00:46:55,130 --> 00:46:57,770
- 34. - 34? What?

1245
00:46:57,770 --> 00:46:58,870
So Min is excited.

1246
00:46:58,870 --> 00:46:59,970
We are going to talk afterward.

1247
00:46:59,970 --> 00:47:01,510
You have to tell me some of your secrets.

1248
00:47:01,840 --> 00:47:03,610
What about him? The glasses guy.

1249
00:47:03,610 --> 00:47:04,810
The glasses?

1250
00:47:06,780 --> 00:47:08,510
- 30... - 30?

1251
00:47:10,850 --> 00:47:11,920
Six.

1252
00:47:14,250 --> 00:47:16,460
Adria is like...

1253
00:47:16,520 --> 00:47:18,960
She is like Santa Claus.

1254
00:47:19,290 --> 00:47:20,960
- Seriously. - She is the nicest.

1255
00:47:20,960 --> 00:47:22,230
42?

1256
00:47:23,200 --> 00:47:24,400
54.

1257
00:47:24,600 --> 00:47:26,330
- 54? - Yes.

1258
00:47:26,330 --> 00:47:27,800
- What? - What?

1259
00:47:28,630 --> 00:47:30,400
They are genuinely surprised.

1260
00:47:30,670 --> 00:47:32,910
In Korean age, I am 54.

1261
00:47:32,910 --> 00:47:36,010
In American age, I am 53. 52.

1262
00:47:36,010 --> 00:47:37,440
- Dad? - Yes.

1263
00:47:37,440 --> 00:47:39,280
Dad? No dad!

1264
00:47:39,980 --> 00:47:43,020
- Dad? - Yes. Dad? No dad!

1265
00:47:43,950 --> 00:47:45,420
I am not your dad.

1266
00:47:46,050 --> 00:47:48,220
But you are a dad!

1267
00:47:48,650 --> 00:47:50,820
You are a dad! You are a dad!

1268
00:47:51,690 --> 00:47:52,860
My goodness.

1269
00:47:52,860 --> 00:47:55,360
- Ryan has a way with words. - He doesn't take a break.

1270
00:47:55,360 --> 00:47:56,930
He is good.

1271
00:47:57,130 --> 00:48:00,000
Please interpret this.

1272
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:02,270
He has a way with words.

1273
00:48:02,430 --> 00:48:03,640
- Seriously. - Yes.

1274
00:48:03,640 --> 00:48:06,010
That's what this gesture means. Ryan.

1275
00:48:08,670 --> 00:48:10,410
That's what this gesture means.

1276
00:48:11,280 --> 00:48:13,810
The direct translation of this means, "Shut up, Ryan."

1277
00:48:14,750 --> 00:48:16,520
"Please, shut up."

1278
00:48:16,750 --> 00:48:21,390
Adria, we have another question for you.

1279
00:48:21,620 --> 00:48:25,160
- Your father is a musician. - Really?

1280
00:48:25,160 --> 00:48:27,990
He traveled around the world.

1281
00:48:27,990 --> 00:48:29,460
- Yes. - Really?

1282
00:48:29,460 --> 00:48:31,300
He still is a musician.

1283
00:48:31,300 --> 00:48:35,370
He still tours the whole world. I was raised in a tour bus.

1284
00:48:35,370 --> 00:48:37,300
- Yes. - That's cool.

1285
00:48:37,540 --> 00:48:38,800
That's really cool.

1286
00:48:38,800 --> 00:48:41,270
Do you know any K-Pop singers or songs?

1287
00:48:42,240 --> 00:48:43,980
Show them your BTS tattoo.

1288
00:48:45,380 --> 00:48:47,450
- Tattoo? - BTS tattoo?

1289
00:48:47,450 --> 00:48:49,350
Am I serious? Am I joking?

1290
00:48:49,520 --> 00:48:51,750
- You will never know. - My goodness.

1291
00:48:52,450 --> 00:48:54,190
- I thought he was serious. - Ryan has...

1292
00:48:54,190 --> 00:48:55,650
a way with words.

1293
00:48:55,690 --> 00:48:57,720
I thought he was serious.

1294
00:48:57,720 --> 00:49:00,760
I have an EXO tattoo on my lower back.

1295
00:49:01,430 --> 00:49:04,660
I have an EXO tattoo on my lower back.

1296
00:49:04,660 --> 00:49:07,230
- It's on my lower back. - An EXO tattoo on your lower back.

1297
00:49:07,230 --> 00:49:09,030
I will only show you. You can take a look.

1298
00:49:09,200 --> 00:49:10,370
- It's okay. - No?

1299
00:49:10,700 --> 00:49:11,800
All right.

1300
00:49:11,800 --> 00:49:12,810
He showed me.

1301
00:49:13,810 --> 00:49:16,940
A world-class star showed me his flesh.

1302
00:49:17,110 --> 00:49:18,410
- I was surprised too. - It was the first time.

1303
00:49:19,580 --> 00:49:20,850
He is the best.

1304
00:49:20,850 --> 00:49:23,520
Let's ask a question to Melanie.

1305
00:49:23,520 --> 00:49:24,880
Melanie!

1306
00:49:25,220 --> 00:49:27,850
Melanie Laurent!

1307
00:49:28,020 --> 00:49:30,260
- Melanie! - Yes, Melanie!

1308
00:49:31,720 --> 00:49:33,090
Melanie!

1309
00:49:34,030 --> 00:49:36,960
Melanie, you visited Korea again...

1310
00:49:36,960 --> 00:49:40,000
four years after you had a photoshoot here.

1311
00:49:40,070 --> 00:49:42,300
The thing is,

1312
00:49:42,300 --> 00:49:43,670
there are...

1313
00:49:43,670 --> 00:49:47,070
quite a few Korean actors who said Melanie is their ideal type.

1314
00:49:47,710 --> 00:49:49,240
Who are they?

1315
00:49:49,410 --> 00:49:51,580
Kang Ha Neul.

1316
00:49:52,640 --> 00:49:56,180
He is really famous right now in Korea.

1317
00:49:56,180 --> 00:49:58,280
He is a really young and hot guy.

1318
00:49:58,280 --> 00:49:59,820
Yes? Okay.

1319
00:50:00,290 --> 00:50:01,750
I can... My husband is here,

1320
00:50:01,750 --> 00:50:05,660
but I am French, so I am kind of like open to whatever.

1321
00:50:06,330 --> 00:50:07,630
Let's see what happens.

1322
00:50:07,730 --> 00:50:10,460
My goodness. Melanie also has...

1323
00:50:10,860 --> 00:50:12,870
- a way with words. - Right?

1324
00:50:12,870 --> 00:50:14,070
It's her.

1325
00:50:14,330 --> 00:50:15,570
My goodness.

1326
00:50:15,800 --> 00:50:17,440
She is funny.

1327
00:50:18,200 --> 00:50:20,610
Since we taught you this gesture,

1328
00:50:20,610 --> 00:50:23,610
please use it to other people when you go back.

1329
00:50:24,440 --> 00:50:26,250
Use it to other people in Hollywood.

1330
00:50:26,610 --> 00:50:28,950
This is very Deadpool.

1331
00:50:28,950 --> 00:50:30,080
Seriously.

1332
00:50:30,750 --> 00:50:33,720
We took some time to get to know...

1333
00:50:33,720 --> 00:50:35,150
the three of them.

1334
00:50:35,150 --> 00:50:36,590
Now, let's get started in earnest.

1335
00:50:36,590 --> 00:50:39,960
Team Running Man and Team Actors will go against each other...

1336
00:50:39,960 --> 00:50:44,000
in the final mission, Lucky Six Match.

1337
00:50:44,230 --> 00:50:46,200
The three members of Team Actors...

1338
00:50:46,200 --> 00:50:49,500
saw the nine profile photos in the morning...

1339
00:50:49,500 --> 00:50:52,240
and added three members to their team.

1340
00:50:52,400 --> 00:50:53,610
- That's right. - That's right.

1341
00:50:53,610 --> 00:50:55,140
- That's right. - How embarrassing!

1342
00:50:55,140 --> 00:50:56,340
The three members are...

1343
00:51:07,420 --> 00:51:08,790
- Okay. - Who starts?

1344
00:51:09,330 --> 00:51:11,930
- You can start. - I think I am going to go with...

1345
00:51:13,730 --> 00:51:14,760
Yoo.

1346
00:51:14,760 --> 00:51:17,030
Nice. Very wise choice.

1347
00:51:18,030 --> 00:51:19,370
Who are you going to go with?

1348
00:51:19,370 --> 00:51:22,240
Okay. I love that hair. The red hair.

1349
00:51:22,370 --> 00:51:24,640
I am going to go with Ji.

1350
00:51:24,910 --> 00:51:26,280
Ji? Okay.

1351
00:51:26,280 --> 00:51:28,010
I am going to pick Lee.

1352
00:51:28,340 --> 00:51:30,810
So we are going with Yoo, Ji, and Lee.

1353
00:51:32,280 --> 00:51:34,320
Jae Suk, Kwang Soo, and Suk Jin.

1354
00:51:34,320 --> 00:51:35,650
- Okay! - What?

1355
00:51:35,650 --> 00:51:36,690
- The three of us? - Okay.

1356
00:51:36,690 --> 00:51:37,820
What's up?

1357
00:51:37,820 --> 00:51:39,860
- Oh, yes. - Really?

1358
00:51:40,220 --> 00:51:41,560
Oh, yes.

1359
00:51:41,560 --> 00:51:42,830
Did they really pick the three of us?

1360
00:51:42,830 --> 00:51:44,760
- Why? - What was the criterion?

1361
00:51:44,760 --> 00:51:45,890
Why?

1362
00:51:45,890 --> 00:51:47,330
- Why? Why? - What was the criterion?

1363
00:51:47,330 --> 00:51:48,760
- That came out of nowhere. - Why?

1364
00:51:48,760 --> 00:51:50,030
- I mean... - Why?

1365
00:51:50,030 --> 00:51:52,740
Because. Look at you guys! You are warriors!

1366
00:51:53,670 --> 00:51:55,940
- We are? - Oh, my goodness.

1367
00:51:55,940 --> 00:51:58,210
- We are warriors? - Warriors.

1368
00:51:58,710 --> 00:52:01,510
From those photos, I am the true warrior.

1369
00:52:04,350 --> 00:52:06,280
You will play the game...

1370
00:52:06,280 --> 00:52:07,480
6 versus 6.

1371
00:52:07,480 --> 00:52:10,750
To win the final mission, you must win 2 out of 3 rounds.

1372
00:52:10,750 --> 00:52:12,450
You will play...

1373
00:52:12,450 --> 00:52:15,520
traditional Korean games as the actors requested.

1374
00:52:15,520 --> 00:52:17,290
Each round, the winning team...

1375
00:52:17,290 --> 00:52:19,900
will receive Korean snacks.

1376
00:52:19,900 --> 00:52:21,000
Okay.

1377
00:52:22,460 --> 00:52:23,830
Those snacks are delicious.

1378
00:52:24,400 --> 00:52:25,530
Let's play!

1379
00:52:25,870 --> 00:52:29,440
- Let's play! - Let's begin the match.

1380
00:52:29,440 --> 00:52:30,440
Yes!

1381
00:52:35,380 --> 00:52:37,310
Come on, guys. Come on, guys.

1382
00:52:37,310 --> 00:52:38,710
- We are going to do this. - Come on.

1383
00:52:39,450 --> 00:52:40,720
I am very excited.

1384
00:52:41,850 --> 00:52:43,820
- I am going to get really excited. - Yes.

1385
00:52:43,820 --> 00:52:45,950
Ryan keeps using this gesture.

1386
00:52:51,560 --> 00:52:53,660
Their organization is scaring me.

1387
00:52:53,660 --> 00:52:56,170
Look how perfect they are. I feel like they are the winners.

1388
00:52:56,170 --> 00:52:58,530
- It's not like that. - I really want to tell them.

1389
00:52:58,530 --> 00:53:00,040
- The three of them... - It's not like that.

1390
00:53:00,040 --> 00:53:02,500
- I wish I was fluent in English. - I wish I could show them.

1391
00:53:02,670 --> 00:53:05,440
How do I say in English, "You basically stepped on poop"?

1392
00:53:05,440 --> 00:53:08,040
- Seriously. - I will play with seriousness.

1393
00:53:08,040 --> 00:53:11,810
The first game is jegi.

1394
00:53:13,050 --> 00:53:14,280
Jegi?

1395
00:53:14,280 --> 00:53:16,020
- The teams will take turns. - Okay.

1396
00:53:16,220 --> 00:53:20,220
The six members must choose the order from 1st to 6th.

1397
00:53:20,560 --> 00:53:22,190
The first player must kick once or more.

1398
00:53:22,190 --> 00:53:23,630
The second player must kick twice or more.

1399
00:53:23,630 --> 00:53:26,030
The 5th player must kick 5 times or more and so on...

1400
00:53:26,030 --> 00:53:27,930
for the team to succeed.

1401
00:53:28,130 --> 00:53:29,570
We need time to practice.

1402
00:53:29,570 --> 00:53:30,630
We will give you time to practice.

1403
00:53:30,770 --> 00:53:32,500
- This is... - Have they played this game before?

1404
00:53:34,040 --> 00:53:36,210
You kick with the inside of your foot.

1405
00:53:36,210 --> 00:53:37,770
Jegi is hard.

1406
00:53:39,370 --> 00:53:41,110
- Don't hurt me. - Melanie.

1407
00:53:41,110 --> 00:53:42,610
- This is bad. - I am trying.

1408
00:53:42,610 --> 00:53:44,080
- This is... - There you go.

1409
00:53:48,250 --> 00:53:49,850
You are good!

1410
00:53:50,450 --> 00:53:52,320
You are good!

1411
00:53:53,190 --> 00:53:54,460
That's incredible.

1412
00:53:54,460 --> 00:53:55,790
- Are you ready? - What?

1413
00:53:57,090 --> 00:53:58,530
- What was that? - My goodness.

1414
00:53:58,530 --> 00:54:00,060
We won!

1415
00:54:00,200 --> 00:54:01,730
- We are done. - He is so good.

1416
00:54:01,730 --> 00:54:03,030
- We win! - I am done.

1417
00:54:03,030 --> 00:54:04,730
- He is so good. - What is up with him?

1418
00:54:04,730 --> 00:54:05,830
- I think... - How is that possible?

1419
00:54:05,830 --> 00:54:07,370
- he is just athletic. - That's sexy.

1420
00:54:07,500 --> 00:54:08,640
That's sexy.

1421
00:54:08,640 --> 00:54:10,510
Did you play soccer before?

1422
00:54:10,510 --> 00:54:11,740
- What? No. - Soccer? No?

1423
00:54:11,740 --> 00:54:13,440
- Hacky sack. - Hacky sack.

1424
00:54:15,340 --> 00:54:16,980
- Good. - Two.

1425
00:54:17,950 --> 00:54:18,980
- Okay. - Two.

1426
00:54:18,980 --> 00:54:21,080
- You got it. - 1, 2.

1427
00:54:21,080 --> 00:54:22,380
- Perfect. - Are you three?

1428
00:54:22,380 --> 00:54:24,690
- Shall we play Race of Wits? - Shall we?

1429
00:54:24,690 --> 00:54:25,690
- Let's do that. - Okay.

1430
00:54:25,690 --> 00:54:28,260
- Let's play Race of Wits. - It's better to go first.

1431
00:54:28,520 --> 00:54:30,430
Let's explain the rules to the three of them.

1432
00:54:30,430 --> 00:54:31,490
Let's demonstrate.

1433
00:54:31,490 --> 00:54:33,500
I can't believe I will play Race of Wits with them.

1434
00:54:33,660 --> 00:54:35,500
I played Race of Wits so many times.

1435
00:54:35,600 --> 00:54:36,800
- Watch us. - Watch us.

1436
00:54:36,800 --> 00:54:38,400
- Watch. - This game.

1437
00:54:38,400 --> 00:54:40,000
- What? - I don't know. We'll see.

1438
00:54:40,700 --> 00:54:42,770
- They're going to play this game? - Ryan's Race of Wits.

1439
00:54:42,770 --> 00:54:44,670
Start. One.

1440
00:54:46,710 --> 00:54:47,710
Two.

1441
00:54:52,610 --> 00:54:54,820
- 3. - 4.

1442
00:54:55,220 --> 00:54:56,250
- 5. - 5.

1443
00:54:57,890 --> 00:54:59,390
- 3. 4. - 5.

1444
00:55:01,860 --> 00:55:03,560
- You got it? - Okay.

1445
00:55:03,560 --> 00:55:05,460
- Do you understand, Melanie? - Okay?

1446
00:55:05,460 --> 00:55:06,930
Do you get it?

1447
00:55:06,930 --> 00:55:09,830
I really love this game,

1448
00:55:09,830 --> 00:55:12,070
but I didn't know I'd be playing Race of Wits with these world stars.

1449
00:55:12,070 --> 00:55:13,570
This day has come.

1450
00:55:13,570 --> 00:55:15,070
- My heart is beating so fast. - This day has come.

1451
00:55:15,070 --> 00:55:17,170
He loves this game.

1452
00:55:17,170 --> 00:55:18,970
I really love this game.

1453
00:55:18,970 --> 00:55:21,380
Can you believe how tall he is?

1454
00:55:21,380 --> 00:55:24,480
So tall.

1455
00:55:24,480 --> 00:55:26,110
Okay.

1456
00:55:28,480 --> 00:55:29,480
Melanie.

1457
00:55:29,720 --> 00:55:32,290
No, no.

1458
00:55:32,290 --> 00:55:34,120
- No. - Stop.

1459
00:55:34,120 --> 00:55:35,690
- Ready... - Okay.

1460
00:55:36,060 --> 00:55:37,230
Ready...

1461
00:55:38,230 --> 00:55:39,460
- Go. - One.

1462
00:55:39,860 --> 00:55:41,360
- Go. - One.

1463
00:55:41,760 --> 00:55:43,270
Two.

1464
00:55:48,070 --> 00:55:49,070
- 3. - 3.

1465
00:55:51,710 --> 00:55:53,440
- Out. - We're out.

1466
00:55:53,440 --> 00:55:54,480
We're out.

1467
00:55:54,480 --> 00:55:55,980
He's really bad.

1468
00:55:55,980 --> 00:55:57,580
So Mi, why did you go?

1469
00:55:58,350 --> 00:56:00,350
Ready, go.

1470
00:56:00,950 --> 00:56:03,220
One.

1471
00:56:08,320 --> 00:56:09,660
Two.

1472
00:56:09,660 --> 00:56:10,790
- 3. - 4.

1473
00:56:10,830 --> 00:56:12,560
- 5. - 6.

1474
00:56:12,830 --> 00:56:13,830
Seven.

1475
00:56:15,560 --> 00:56:17,330
- 5. - 6.

1476
00:56:17,330 --> 00:56:18,400
Seven.

1477
00:56:18,400 --> 00:56:19,470
- 8. - 9.

1478
00:56:19,470 --> 00:56:20,470
Ten.

1479
00:56:21,340 --> 00:56:22,440
- 8. - 9.

1480
00:56:22,440 --> 00:56:23,510
Ten.

1481
00:56:25,970 --> 00:56:27,240
I went easy on them.

1482
00:56:27,240 --> 00:56:28,980
- You did? - I went easy.

1483
00:56:28,980 --> 00:56:30,510
You didn't go easy.

1484
00:56:30,510 --> 00:56:32,610
- I really like these actors, - Come with me.

1485
00:56:32,610 --> 00:56:34,780
- so I sacrificed myself. - Come.

1486
00:56:34,950 --> 00:56:35,980
I went easy on them.

1487
00:56:35,980 --> 00:56:38,550
It's really fun seeing them getting nervous...

1488
00:56:38,550 --> 00:56:39,760
- and enjoying this game. - This is so much fun.

1489
00:56:39,760 --> 00:56:40,960
It's fun.

1490
00:56:41,820 --> 00:56:42,890
Ready,

1491
00:56:43,390 --> 00:56:46,030
- I'm 1. I'm going to do 1. - go.

1492
00:56:48,260 --> 00:56:49,300
- 1. - 2.

1493
00:56:49,460 --> 00:56:50,470
Three.

1494
00:56:51,770 --> 00:56:53,840
Four.

1495
00:56:55,470 --> 00:56:57,140
Five.

1496
00:56:57,140 --> 00:56:58,210
- 6. - 6.

1497
00:56:58,970 --> 00:57:00,040
- 6. - 6.

1498
00:57:00,780 --> 00:57:02,410
- Both out. - My bad.

1499
00:57:02,410 --> 00:57:03,780
- Sorry. - What was that?

1500
00:57:03,780 --> 00:57:05,250
I didn't mean to.

1501
00:57:05,250 --> 00:57:06,450
- Why were you trying to win? - I didn't mean to.

1502
00:57:06,450 --> 00:57:07,620
- You were trying to win. - No!

1503
00:57:07,620 --> 00:57:09,320
- You're not witty. - No.

1504
00:57:09,320 --> 00:57:10,720
- I didn't mean to. - You beat Melanie.

1505
00:57:10,720 --> 00:57:12,520
- You were trying to win. - No, it was an instinct.

1506
00:57:12,520 --> 00:57:13,760
Sorry, Melanie.

1507
00:57:13,760 --> 00:57:16,330
- What? - We said "seven" together.

1508
00:57:16,330 --> 00:57:17,660
- Together... - We're out together.

1509
00:57:17,660 --> 00:57:19,460
- Okay. Together... - We're out together.

1510
00:57:19,460 --> 00:57:20,960
We're out together. It's fine.

1511
00:57:20,960 --> 00:57:23,470
- "We're out together." - It's getting exciting.

1512
00:57:23,470 --> 00:57:24,770
Stay out of this, Ji Hyo.

1513
00:57:24,770 --> 00:57:27,070
"We're out together."

1514
00:57:27,070 --> 00:57:29,370
He looks ready. Good.

1515
00:57:29,370 --> 00:57:30,440
The elite members.

1516
00:57:30,440 --> 00:57:32,240
Good luck.

1517
00:57:32,240 --> 00:57:34,140
- Ready, - Go first.

1518
00:57:34,140 --> 00:57:35,140
go.

1519
00:57:35,280 --> 00:57:36,350
- 1. - 1.

1520
00:57:37,080 --> 00:57:38,610
Oh, my.

1521
00:57:38,710 --> 00:57:40,150
- 1. - 1. Oh, my.

1522
00:57:40,150 --> 00:57:41,380
Come on.

1523
00:57:41,380 --> 00:57:42,520
Was it you?

1524
00:57:42,520 --> 00:57:43,890
- Him. - What?

1525
00:57:43,890 --> 00:57:44,890
Was it you?

1526
00:57:44,890 --> 00:57:46,090
- Him. - What?

1527
00:57:46,090 --> 00:57:47,560
- Me? - Ryan called one.

1528
00:57:47,560 --> 00:57:49,060
- No, it was Adria. - It was her?

1529
00:57:49,060 --> 00:57:50,390
Okay.

1530
00:57:50,530 --> 00:57:52,560
- Do rock-paper-scissors. - It's rock-paper-scissors.

1531
00:57:52,560 --> 00:57:54,400
This is an honor.

1532
00:57:54,400 --> 00:57:57,070
- Rock-paper-scissors. - Rock-paper-scissors.

1533
00:57:57,170 --> 00:57:58,930
Go, Ryan.

1534
00:58:00,570 --> 00:58:02,570
Shoot.

1535
00:58:04,040 --> 00:58:05,670
You're so slow-witted. Why would you win?

1536
00:58:05,670 --> 00:58:07,480
- Okay! - It's us then.

1537
00:58:07,480 --> 00:58:08,840
I'm the guy who beat Ryan.

1538
00:58:10,580 --> 00:58:11,850
Do you want to go first or should we go?

1539
00:58:11,850 --> 00:58:13,320
They go first.

1540
00:58:13,320 --> 00:58:15,080
- Okay. - 1, 2, 3.

1541
00:58:15,080 --> 00:58:16,280
- Let's go! - Let's go!

1542
00:58:16,280 --> 00:58:17,590
1, 2, 3.

1543
00:58:17,590 --> 00:58:19,620
- Let's go! - Let's go!

1544
00:58:19,690 --> 00:58:21,160
- Are you ready? - Yes!

1545
00:58:21,360 --> 00:58:23,060
Go first, Adria.

1546
00:58:23,160 --> 00:58:24,330
- Do I go first? - Yes.

1547
00:58:24,330 --> 00:58:25,690
Oh, my gosh.

1548
00:58:26,360 --> 00:58:27,430
At least one.

1549
00:58:27,430 --> 00:58:29,130
- It touched her foot. - No, wait. No, no.

1550
00:58:29,130 --> 00:58:30,230
- She touched it. - At least one.

1551
00:58:31,300 --> 00:58:33,300
- No, wait. No, no. - She touched it.

1552
00:58:33,300 --> 00:58:34,470
I don't think she did.

1553
00:58:40,610 --> 00:58:42,080
- She touched it. - I don't think she did.

1554
00:58:42,080 --> 00:58:43,150
No, she touched it.

1555
00:58:43,150 --> 00:58:44,380
That doesn't count?

1556
00:58:44,680 --> 00:58:46,150
Okay, I'm going to go again though.

1557
00:58:46,150 --> 00:58:48,150
- Because... - One more chance?

1558
00:58:48,220 --> 00:58:49,620
One more chance.

1559
00:58:50,850 --> 00:58:51,890
One more chance.

1560
00:58:51,890 --> 00:58:52,920
- Because... - Sides.

1561
00:58:52,920 --> 00:58:55,020
One more chance.

1562
00:58:55,560 --> 00:58:56,560
- Okay. - One.

1563
00:58:57,990 --> 00:58:59,160
- Okay. - One.

1564
00:58:59,590 --> 00:59:02,130
- Melanie. - Oh, my gosh.

1565
00:59:02,130 --> 00:59:03,370
- 2. - 2.

1566
00:59:03,370 --> 00:59:04,770
- Please, Melanie. - Two.

1567
00:59:05,570 --> 00:59:07,070
- She must be nervous. - You got this.

1568
00:59:08,340 --> 00:59:09,770
- She must be nervous. - You got this.

1569
00:59:14,110 --> 00:59:15,340
- She touched it. - I touched it a little bit.

1570
00:59:15,340 --> 00:59:16,510
She just touched it.

1571
00:59:18,150 --> 00:59:20,050
- I touched it a little bit. - She touched it.

1572
00:59:20,050 --> 00:59:21,050
No.

1573
00:59:21,050 --> 00:59:22,750
- It's our turn. - Do we go?

1574
00:59:22,880 --> 00:59:24,620
- Next time. - I had another try.

1575
00:59:24,620 --> 00:59:26,320
- She gets to have another try. - Okay.

1576
00:59:26,320 --> 00:59:28,260
- They're stubborn too. - She's stubborn.

1577
00:59:28,260 --> 00:59:29,560
Hollywood stars are stubborn too.

1578
00:59:29,560 --> 00:59:31,060
Come on!

1579
00:59:31,660 --> 00:59:33,430
- It's not just us. - These are rules.

1580
00:59:33,430 --> 00:59:34,660
We can't do this all night.

1581
00:59:34,660 --> 00:59:35,960
I guess everybody is stubborn.

1582
00:59:35,960 --> 00:59:37,430
- Fine. - Everybody around the world.

1583
00:59:37,430 --> 00:59:38,470
Let her go again.

1584
00:59:38,470 --> 00:59:40,070
- Okay. - All right.

1585
00:59:40,070 --> 00:59:41,770
- Give us 1 more chance too then. - 1 more chance.

1586
00:59:42,070 --> 00:59:43,170
Go like this.

1587
00:59:43,170 --> 00:59:45,110
Oh, my gosh. So much pressure.

1588
00:59:56,320 --> 00:59:57,350
Oh, my gosh.

1589
01:00:02,120 --> 01:00:04,260
Kwang Soo.

1590
01:00:04,660 --> 01:00:05,830
It's better the more you get.

1591
01:00:05,830 --> 01:00:07,660
- This is a traditional game. - More is better.

1592
01:00:07,660 --> 01:00:09,600
- I'm really bad at this. - We have to watch Ryan play.

1593
01:00:09,600 --> 01:00:12,200
- Kwang Soo, more is better. - You're not that important.

1594
01:00:12,270 --> 01:00:13,670
Ryan can do five.

1595
01:00:25,280 --> 01:00:27,720
- Keep going. - Great.

1596
01:00:27,720 --> 01:00:28,880
- Okay. - Five.

1597
01:00:28,880 --> 01:00:31,290
You got it! Beautiful.

1598
01:00:31,790 --> 01:00:33,860
There you go.

1599
01:00:34,590 --> 01:00:36,020
- There you go. - That's our new dance.

1600
01:00:36,020 --> 01:00:37,490
We should do that now.

1601
01:00:37,490 --> 01:00:39,230
- Nice! - That's our new dance.

1602
01:00:39,230 --> 01:00:41,560
We should do that now. That's our new dance.

1603
01:00:45,830 --> 01:00:49,270
- He's so dirty. - What's wrong with him?

1604
01:00:49,270 --> 01:00:51,210
Suk Jin.

1605
01:00:51,210 --> 01:00:52,870
Say, "Hey, handsome man."

1606
01:00:53,040 --> 01:00:54,410
- What? - What?

1607
01:00:54,410 --> 01:00:55,610
- What? - Cut out the nonsense.

1608
01:00:55,610 --> 01:00:56,880
- Handsome man. - What are you doing?

1609
01:00:56,880 --> 01:00:58,250
- Handsome man. - Okay.

1610
01:00:58,250 --> 01:01:00,150
Wait, he's not on our team. No.

1611
01:01:00,150 --> 01:01:01,620
- He's on our team. - He's on our team.

1612
01:01:03,350 --> 01:01:06,690
- He is? You're so... - We're on the same team.

1613
01:01:06,690 --> 01:01:09,160
- He's not on our team. No. - He's on our team.

1614
01:01:09,160 --> 01:01:10,360
- He's on our team. - Oh, he is!

1615
01:01:10,360 --> 01:01:12,160
We're on the same team.

1616
01:01:12,290 --> 01:01:14,060
She didn't know he was on our team.

1617
01:01:14,060 --> 01:01:15,600
We're on the same team.

1618
01:01:16,130 --> 01:01:17,700
- I mean... - You're so beautiful.

1619
01:01:17,700 --> 01:01:19,400
- Handsome man. - She didn't know.

1620
01:01:19,400 --> 01:01:21,240
- Come on. - Handsome.

1621
01:01:21,240 --> 01:01:22,940
Handsome man.

1622
01:01:22,940 --> 01:01:24,410
- Handsome man. - Handsome man.

1623
01:01:24,410 --> 01:01:26,040
Handsome man.

1624
01:01:26,040 --> 01:01:27,380
- Adria is so cute. - That was shocking.

1625
01:01:27,380 --> 01:01:28,880
"He's not on our team."

1626
01:01:28,880 --> 01:01:30,950
People around the world are rooting for you.

1627
01:01:30,950 --> 01:01:32,950
- We can get big worldwide. - I know.

1628
01:01:32,950 --> 01:01:35,180
- Go for 4. - At least 4.

1629
01:01:35,380 --> 01:01:38,390
1, 2, 3...

1630
01:01:39,350 --> 01:01:40,390
Three...

1631
01:01:41,060 --> 01:01:42,060
Four!

1632
01:01:42,060 --> 01:01:44,490
5, 6, 7.

1633
01:01:44,490 --> 01:01:45,930
Yes!

1634
01:01:45,930 --> 01:01:47,500
Dance!

1635
01:01:47,500 --> 01:01:48,900
Dance.

1636
01:01:50,030 --> 01:01:51,700
They are all doing it.

1637
01:01:51,700 --> 01:01:52,970
Ryan.

1638
01:01:52,970 --> 01:01:54,400
They are all doing it.

1639
01:01:54,400 --> 01:01:57,040
Ryan. Go, Ryan.

1640
01:01:57,040 --> 01:01:59,980
- 5. - 5.

1641
01:02:09,150 --> 01:02:11,220
- Ryan. - Five?

1642
01:02:14,520 --> 01:02:16,290
- No! - Practice. That was practice.

1643
01:02:16,890 --> 01:02:19,260
- No! - Practice. That was practice.

1644
01:02:19,260 --> 01:02:20,300
- No, it's over. - That was practice.

1645
01:02:20,300 --> 01:02:21,430
- He didn't say he was starting. - It's over.

1646
01:02:21,430 --> 01:02:23,330
- It's over. - It's not.

1647
01:02:23,330 --> 01:02:26,300
- It's over. - He didn't say he was starting.

1648
01:02:26,640 --> 01:02:28,670
What's wrong with Ryan?

1649
01:02:28,670 --> 01:02:30,010
It's over.

1650
01:02:32,610 --> 01:02:34,910
- What's wrong, Ryan? - That was so random.

1651
01:02:35,580 --> 01:02:37,280
- No way. - Fine.

1652
01:02:38,050 --> 01:02:39,780
- No way. - Is that necessary?

1653
01:02:39,780 --> 01:02:40,850
Fine.

1654
01:02:40,850 --> 01:02:42,350
- Next time. - No problem.

1655
01:02:42,350 --> 01:02:44,220
- I tried twice. - Your turn.

1656
01:02:44,220 --> 01:02:45,290
Now.

1657
01:02:45,490 --> 01:02:46,720
- Okay. - Bo Ra.

1658
01:02:46,720 --> 01:02:48,590
- Just get 1. - Get 1.

1659
01:02:48,590 --> 01:02:50,130
- Do one. - It's easy.

1660
01:02:50,130 --> 01:02:51,660
Okay! It's easy.

1661
01:02:52,060 --> 01:02:53,760
- All right! - Gosh.

1662
01:02:53,760 --> 01:02:55,130
It dropped long before that.

1663
01:02:55,130 --> 01:02:56,200
It's fine.

1664
01:02:56,200 --> 01:02:57,470
- Bo Ra. - There was lag.

1665
01:02:57,470 --> 01:02:59,700
It dropped long before that.

1666
01:02:59,700 --> 01:03:01,500
Let's scare her.

1667
01:03:01,570 --> 01:03:03,070
If we can't do this...

1668
01:03:03,270 --> 01:03:04,770
I'm so nervous.

1669
01:03:04,970 --> 01:03:06,780
- You can do it. It's okay. - Touch it twice.

1670
01:03:06,780 --> 01:03:08,040
It's okay. Tap, tap.

1671
01:03:08,480 --> 01:03:09,680
Okay. Out.

1672
01:03:09,680 --> 01:03:11,110
Tap, tap.

1673
01:03:11,110 --> 01:03:12,650
- Okay! - Okay!

1674
01:03:15,450 --> 01:03:16,580
Why?

1675
01:03:16,580 --> 01:03:18,220
You failed. Why would you do this?

1676
01:03:18,220 --> 01:03:19,350
I wanted to try it.

1677
01:03:19,350 --> 01:03:20,660
Sorry.

1678
01:03:20,720 --> 01:03:22,420
- Ryan too. - All right. One.

1679
01:03:24,090 --> 01:03:25,360
- Yes! - Yes!

1680
01:03:25,490 --> 01:03:27,030
Right.

1681
01:03:28,460 --> 01:03:29,530
- Kwang Soo. - Kwang Soo.

1682
01:03:29,530 --> 01:03:31,070
- I'm okay. - Don't try to be funny.

1683
01:03:31,070 --> 01:03:32,700
We have to watch Ryan play.

1684
01:03:32,700 --> 01:03:33,700
Come on.

1685
01:03:39,640 --> 01:03:41,080
- Okay! - Yes.

1686
01:03:41,910 --> 01:03:43,580
- Okay! - Yes.

1687
01:03:44,050 --> 01:03:45,950
I can't do this.

1688
01:03:46,150 --> 01:03:47,320
Ryan.

1689
01:03:47,320 --> 01:03:48,980
- Let's go, Ryan. - Ryan.

1690
01:03:48,980 --> 01:03:50,150
I'll go fifth.

1691
01:03:50,150 --> 01:03:51,220
1, 2.

1692
01:03:51,220 --> 01:03:52,420
- I'll go 5th. - 1, 2.

1693
01:03:53,590 --> 01:03:54,590
Three.

1694
01:03:54,590 --> 01:03:55,760
No!

1695
01:03:56,360 --> 01:03:58,460
Why does he keep doing that?

1696
01:03:59,760 --> 01:04:02,400
Why does he keep doing that?

1697
01:04:02,400 --> 01:04:04,600
- What are you doing? - Stop it.

1698
01:04:04,770 --> 01:04:06,840
Why are you doing this, Ryan?

1699
01:04:06,840 --> 01:04:08,070
Why is he doing that?

1700
01:04:08,070 --> 01:04:09,700
Why do you keep doing that?

1701
01:04:09,700 --> 01:04:11,340
- Good job. - Good job.

1702
01:04:11,340 --> 01:04:13,410
- Respect. - I truly respect you.

1703
01:04:13,510 --> 01:04:16,710
- Big brother. - I don't think this game will end,

1704
01:04:16,710 --> 01:04:18,780
so let's just combine everybody's scores.

1705
01:04:18,780 --> 01:04:20,280
- All right. - Good.

1706
01:04:20,280 --> 01:04:22,080
- I agree. - Guys should go after.

1707
01:04:22,080 --> 01:04:23,720
The team that gets more.

1708
01:04:23,720 --> 01:04:25,490
- Can I do two then? - Yes, it doesn't matter.

1709
01:04:25,490 --> 01:04:27,260
- Okay. - Seven.

1710
01:04:27,660 --> 01:04:29,290
- Seven. - Good luck, Dong Hoon.

1711
01:04:29,360 --> 01:04:33,360
- 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, - 8, 9, 10, 11, 12...

1712
01:04:33,360 --> 01:04:35,430
- Good job. - 13, 14,

1713
01:04:35,660 --> 01:04:37,630
13, 14,

1714
01:04:37,670 --> 01:04:39,130
15, 16.

1715
01:04:40,540 --> 01:04:42,570
14, 15.

1716
01:04:50,580 --> 01:04:51,850
- Ryan got hit! - Why did you cheat?

1717
01:04:51,850 --> 01:04:53,350
Ryan got hit by the jegi!

1718
01:04:53,350 --> 01:04:54,480
16.

1719
01:04:54,480 --> 01:04:56,020
- That was good. - All right.

1720
01:04:56,120 --> 01:04:58,150
- That was very good though. - All right.

1721
01:04:58,920 --> 01:05:00,690
- Are we at 16? - 16.

1722
01:05:01,190 --> 01:05:02,660
16.

1723
01:05:02,660 --> 01:05:03,930
17, 18.

1724
01:05:03,990 --> 01:05:05,230
Get out of town.

1725
01:05:05,830 --> 01:05:06,960
Forget about it.

1726
01:05:08,800 --> 01:05:11,330
Se Chan is good at jegi.

1727
01:05:11,600 --> 01:05:12,670
Finish them off.

1728
01:05:14,640 --> 01:05:16,170
- I am afraid right now. - Yes.

1729
01:05:17,340 --> 01:05:18,840
Who pushed me?

1730
01:05:18,940 --> 01:05:19,940
- Stop it. - Don't push me.

1731
01:05:22,840 --> 01:05:24,210
He is in the flow.

1732
01:05:26,310 --> 01:05:27,750
He is in the flow.

1733
01:05:29,120 --> 01:05:30,690
- 31. - What?

1734
01:05:30,690 --> 01:05:32,020
- 31. - 31.

1735
01:05:32,050 --> 01:05:33,450
- 31. - They have an advantage.

1736
01:05:33,450 --> 01:05:35,290
- That's too much. - I am going to contribute one.

1737
01:05:35,290 --> 01:05:36,390
Adria, go first.

1738
01:05:38,430 --> 01:05:39,830
Yes!

1739
01:05:40,230 --> 01:05:42,000
I will take it!

1740
01:05:46,800 --> 01:05:48,770
I will take it! I will take it!

1741
01:05:52,610 --> 01:05:54,010
She has a competitive streak.

1742
01:05:54,010 --> 01:05:55,540
Get out there, Laurent. Do it.

1743
01:05:56,010 --> 01:05:57,650
How did this dance get started?

1744
01:05:58,250 --> 01:05:59,810
- It's Melanie's fault. - Melanie.

1745
01:06:01,520 --> 01:06:04,190
We actually have a dance.

1746
01:06:04,190 --> 01:06:06,650
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.

1747
01:06:13,160 --> 01:06:14,800
- Melanie. - This is hilarious.

1748
01:06:21,800 --> 01:06:22,940
- Oh, yes! - Two!

1749
01:06:22,970 --> 01:06:24,070
- 2. - 2.

1750
01:06:29,010 --> 01:06:30,110
Come on.

1751
01:06:36,050 --> 01:06:37,090
That's good.

1752
01:06:37,920 --> 01:06:38,920
That's good.

1753
01:06:39,290 --> 01:06:40,360
- 3. - 4.

1754
01:06:40,360 --> 01:06:41,520
- 4. - 4.

1755
01:06:42,190 --> 01:06:43,690
I am just going to click the noises.

1756
01:06:43,990 --> 01:06:45,230
Ryan should go last.

1757
01:06:45,630 --> 01:06:47,760
I should tie that thing to a string.

1758
01:06:50,700 --> 01:06:52,370
- Yes! - Yes.

1759
01:06:52,370 --> 01:06:53,470
My technique!

1760
01:06:54,270 --> 01:06:55,640
- Suk Jin. - You know,

1761
01:06:55,800 --> 01:06:58,340
the preexisting rules...

1762
01:06:58,340 --> 01:07:00,070
- are... - This jegi resembles Suk Jin.

1763
01:07:00,780 --> 01:07:02,580
- It's losing hair. - Suk Jin.

1764
01:07:03,140 --> 01:07:05,350
It's suffering from hair loss like Suk Jin.

1765
01:07:05,650 --> 01:07:06,710
What is up with you?

1766
01:07:06,780 --> 01:07:08,880
- I can kick and go... - Come on.

1767
01:07:10,290 --> 01:07:12,090
- I should kick it 10 times. - That's right.

1768
01:07:12,090 --> 01:07:13,150
You should kick it that many times.

1769
01:07:13,960 --> 01:07:15,520
2, 3, 4...

1770
01:07:15,560 --> 01:07:16,590
That's good.

1771
01:07:16,590 --> 01:07:17,760
- Oh, no. - Six.

1772
01:07:17,760 --> 01:07:19,160
- 7, 8, - That's good.

1773
01:07:19,160 --> 01:07:20,330
9, 10.

1774
01:07:20,630 --> 01:07:22,230
11, 12.

1775
01:07:22,230 --> 01:07:23,600
- Yes! Get it now! - 13, 14,

1776
01:07:23,600 --> 01:07:25,700
- 15, 16. - Yes!

1777
01:07:28,670 --> 01:07:30,100
15, 16.

1778
01:07:30,470 --> 01:07:31,540
17, 18.

1779
01:07:31,670 --> 01:07:33,810
- 18. Okay. - Okay!

1780
01:07:37,880 --> 01:07:40,520
- It's okay. - Okay. That was good.

1781
01:07:40,520 --> 01:07:44,490
- 26. - Okay.

1782
01:07:44,590 --> 01:07:45,590
Two people haven't gone yet, right?

1783
01:07:45,590 --> 01:07:47,560
Ryan can finish this.

1784
01:07:47,860 --> 01:07:48,960
Ryan.

1785
01:07:49,060 --> 01:07:50,460
31 to 36.

1786
01:07:50,460 --> 01:07:52,060
- Ryan can finish this. - Kick it five times.

1787
01:07:52,160 --> 01:07:53,390
Just five!

1788
01:07:53,530 --> 01:07:54,660
Just five. Yes.

1789
01:07:57,730 --> 01:07:58,830
Just five. Yes.

1790
01:07:59,400 --> 01:08:03,000
1, 2, 3,

1791
01:08:03,140 --> 01:08:04,310
four...

1792
01:08:05,840 --> 01:08:08,380
1, 2, 3, 4...

1793
01:08:08,410 --> 01:08:10,080
1, 2, 3,

1794
01:08:10,080 --> 01:08:11,850
4, 5, 6.

1795
01:08:11,850 --> 01:08:13,550
- Yes! - Five...

1796
01:08:13,950 --> 01:08:16,220
Yes!

1797
01:08:18,590 --> 01:08:19,620
What?

1798
01:08:26,530 --> 01:08:28,730
Come on! Come on!

1799
01:08:40,980 --> 01:08:42,110
He is really good.

1800
01:08:44,150 --> 01:08:45,150
That was incredible.

1801
01:08:45,480 --> 01:08:47,380
That was incredible.

1802
01:08:47,380 --> 01:08:49,380
Team Actors win.

1803
01:08:50,250 --> 01:08:52,090
You will get a snack card.

1804
01:08:52,920 --> 01:08:55,460
We will move on to the next game.

1805
01:09:02,560 --> 01:09:03,830
There is nothing he can't do.

1806
01:09:03,830 --> 01:09:04,930
Ryan...

1807
01:09:05,030 --> 01:09:07,070
This isn't an easy game.

1808
01:09:07,070 --> 01:09:08,200
He is good at everything.

1809
01:09:08,770 --> 01:09:09,900
I love it.

1810
01:09:11,410 --> 01:09:12,710
Okay. One more.

1811
01:09:12,840 --> 01:09:15,140
- Teach her how to hold it. - Hold it like this.

1812
01:09:16,140 --> 01:09:18,350
Kwang Soo is trying so hard to be cast.

1813
01:09:19,210 --> 01:09:22,150
Kwang Soo is trying so hard to be cast.

1814
01:09:22,150 --> 01:09:23,890
Good, good.

1815
01:09:23,950 --> 01:09:25,590
- Hey. - Good, good. One more.

1816
01:09:25,650 --> 01:09:27,120
- Let's go. - You are transparent.

1817
01:09:27,290 --> 01:09:28,390
Seriously.

1818
01:09:28,390 --> 01:09:29,420
- He is trying so hard. - My goodness.

1819
01:09:29,420 --> 01:09:31,730
He is trying the hardest today.

1820
01:09:31,730 --> 01:09:33,330
Team Actors wins...

1821
01:09:33,330 --> 01:09:35,360
if more red sides are showing.

1822
01:09:35,360 --> 01:09:37,730
Team Running Man wins if more blue sides are showing.

1823
01:09:38,070 --> 01:09:40,230
Team Actors wins if more red sides are showing.

1824
01:09:40,440 --> 01:09:42,900
We will add up the number of ddakjis in three rounds.

1825
01:09:42,900 --> 01:09:44,640
The team that turns over more ddakjis wins.

1826
01:09:45,040 --> 01:09:48,080
We... Many orange... Good.

1827
01:09:48,080 --> 01:09:49,740
We... Many Blue... Bad.

1828
01:09:50,380 --> 01:09:51,610
- Okay. - What are you saying?

1829
01:09:51,610 --> 01:09:52,850
- Go, go. - What?

1830
01:09:52,850 --> 01:09:54,180
Move out of the way.

1831
01:09:54,650 --> 01:09:58,550
Two players will represent the team in each round.

1832
01:09:58,720 --> 01:09:59,720
Ready.

1833
01:10:00,860 --> 01:10:02,120
- 1 minute. - 1 minute.

1834
01:10:02,290 --> 01:10:03,930
- Come on, Melanie. - You got this, Melanie.

1835
01:10:04,390 --> 01:10:05,590
- Ready. - Come on!

1836
01:10:05,890 --> 01:10:06,890
Go!

1837
01:10:07,700 --> 01:10:08,830
- Close. - Almost.

1838
01:10:09,200 --> 01:10:11,000
- Go! - Good.

1839
01:10:11,000 --> 01:10:12,870
- Close. - Almost.

1840
01:10:12,870 --> 01:10:13,900
Really close.

1841
01:10:15,700 --> 01:10:17,810
I see so many red sides! Get them flipped over.

1842
01:10:18,140 --> 01:10:20,810
Get the ones Kwang Soo can't reach. Behind you.

1843
01:10:21,510 --> 01:10:23,780
Get the ones Kwang Soo can't reach. Behind you.

1844
01:10:24,150 --> 01:10:25,480
Okay. You are doing great.

1845
01:10:25,550 --> 01:10:26,680
Se Chan is good.

1846
01:10:27,050 --> 01:10:28,320
Se Chan is really good.

1847
01:10:28,720 --> 01:10:30,250
- Okay. - Se Chan is really good.

1848
01:10:30,250 --> 01:10:31,350
Okay.

1849
01:10:31,350 --> 01:10:32,520
Now, it's sadness.

1850
01:10:32,790 --> 01:10:34,620
Sadness is taking over my body.

1851
01:10:37,130 --> 01:10:38,230
You are doing great, Mel.

1852
01:10:39,260 --> 01:10:40,390
Now, it's sadness.

1853
01:10:48,100 --> 01:10:49,840
Sadness is taking over my body.

1854
01:10:51,170 --> 01:10:52,470
It's pretty sad.

1855
01:10:55,080 --> 01:10:56,210
It's pretty sad.

1856
01:11:01,320 --> 01:11:02,380
- Melanie. - That's good.

1857
01:11:05,020 --> 01:11:06,050
Come on.

1858
01:11:07,560 --> 01:11:09,020
You got this. You got this.

1859
01:11:10,460 --> 01:11:13,760
- Look at Se Chan. - He is so good.

1860
01:11:14,660 --> 01:11:15,930
Look at Se Chan.

1861
01:11:16,030 --> 01:11:18,000
- I see blue everywhere. - Se Chan is so good.

1862
01:11:18,000 --> 01:11:20,200
I see blue everywhere.

1863
01:11:20,200 --> 01:11:21,740
- 2. - 4.

1864
01:11:21,840 --> 01:11:24,510
3, 2, 1.

1865
01:11:25,510 --> 01:11:26,570
Okay.

1866
01:11:27,740 --> 01:11:29,540
- We won. - We won.

1867
01:11:30,510 --> 01:11:31,780
You were like a machine.

1868
01:11:31,780 --> 01:11:33,410
- You were like a ddakji factory. - Great job, Mel.

1869
01:11:33,680 --> 01:11:35,420
- They killed us. - Yes.

1870
01:11:40,920 --> 01:11:42,120
I got three of them.

1871
01:11:43,520 --> 01:11:44,590
Go!

1872
01:11:45,830 --> 01:11:47,630
- There you go. - She is fast.

1873
01:11:48,060 --> 01:11:49,300
Get angry with it!

1874
01:11:49,400 --> 01:11:50,900
- Okay. - Get angry!

1875
01:11:52,470 --> 01:11:55,140
Suk Jin, you need to do better.

1876
01:12:01,210 --> 01:12:02,840
- Awesome! - Adria!

1877
01:12:02,840 --> 01:12:03,910
Adria!

1878
01:12:04,280 --> 01:12:05,380
Okay. Okay.

1879
01:12:05,380 --> 01:12:07,450
- Time's up. - Good job. Good job.

1880
01:12:08,250 --> 01:12:09,920
The current score is...

1881
01:12:09,920 --> 01:12:11,390
- 25 to 15. - Okay!

1882
01:12:11,390 --> 01:12:13,590
- Let's move on to the third round. - Ryan.

1883
01:12:13,590 --> 01:12:14,860
- I have a bad feeling. - You are the last.

1884
01:12:14,860 --> 01:12:16,520
- Ryan. - Are we going?

1885
01:12:17,060 --> 01:12:18,930
- This is the next round. - Let's turn the tables.

1886
01:12:19,590 --> 01:12:20,730
Come on, Ryan.

1887
01:12:23,600 --> 01:12:24,630
Ready.

1888
01:12:25,000 --> 01:12:26,170
Come on, Ryan.

1889
01:12:29,570 --> 01:12:30,640
Go!

1890
01:12:33,840 --> 01:12:35,280
- Come on, Ryan. - We hit the red ones, right?

1891
01:12:38,580 --> 01:12:39,650
That's good!

1892
01:12:40,720 --> 01:12:42,080
That's good!

1893
01:12:42,820 --> 01:12:43,950
This one. Right here.

1894
01:12:45,850 --> 01:12:47,020
Okay!

1895
01:12:48,220 --> 01:12:50,190
Okay!

1896
01:12:50,190 --> 01:12:52,060
Who plays the Ddakji Game so desperately?

1897
01:12:52,690 --> 01:12:54,460
I have never seen a white man who is so good at this game.

1898
01:12:57,030 --> 01:12:58,070
That's good!

1899
01:13:00,400 --> 01:13:01,700
Why won't it flip over?

1900
01:13:02,300 --> 01:13:04,140
Ryan, Jong Kook is following you.

1901
01:13:04,710 --> 01:13:05,840
Where did it go?

1902
01:13:11,680 --> 01:13:13,410
The ddakji broke.

1903
01:13:13,410 --> 01:13:15,080
Good job. We are winning.

1904
01:13:17,720 --> 01:13:19,650
That's good. You are doing great, Ryan.

1905
01:13:19,650 --> 01:13:20,790
I see red everywhere.

1906
01:13:20,860 --> 01:13:21,920
- Yes! - That's good.

1907
01:13:21,920 --> 01:13:23,090
Yes!

1908
01:13:23,820 --> 01:13:24,930
10,

1909
01:13:24,930 --> 01:13:28,460
- 9, 8. 7, - One more.

1910
01:13:28,460 --> 01:13:30,870
- 6, 5, - One more.

1911
01:13:30,870 --> 01:13:35,000
- 4, 3, 2, 1. - Okay!

1912
01:13:36,800 --> 01:13:38,440
- 2, 1. - Ryan!

1913
01:13:40,740 --> 01:13:41,810
One.

1914
01:13:43,080 --> 01:13:44,950
Good job. Good job.

1915
01:13:45,150 --> 01:13:46,610
But he is not competitive!

1916
01:13:50,380 --> 01:13:51,750
Why did he play so hard?

1917
01:13:52,290 --> 01:13:53,790
He even broke one of the ddakjis.

1918
01:13:53,790 --> 01:13:55,390
- Why did he play so hard? - Most stars don't play so hard.

1919
01:13:56,390 --> 01:13:58,160
He broke a ddakji.

1920
01:13:58,160 --> 01:14:00,560
- How are you knees? - Why did he play so hard?

1921
01:14:00,560 --> 01:14:01,630
I am exhausted.

1922
01:14:01,700 --> 01:14:02,730
The final score.

1923
01:14:04,130 --> 01:14:05,230
It's 16 to 4.

1924
01:14:07,170 --> 01:14:08,840
It's 16 to 4.

1925
01:14:10,100 --> 01:14:12,040
With the score of 31 to 29, Team Actors won.

1926
01:14:12,040 --> 01:14:14,680
We won!

1927
01:14:19,210 --> 01:14:20,920
We win!

1928
01:14:21,620 --> 01:14:23,780
- We didn't go easy on them. - But it looks that way.

1929
01:14:23,780 --> 01:14:25,020
Seriously.

1930
01:14:27,120 --> 01:14:28,220
We didn't go easy on them.

1931
01:14:28,390 --> 01:14:31,660
Since Team Actor won two rounds,

1932
01:14:31,860 --> 01:14:33,630
there won't be more games.

1933
01:14:33,630 --> 01:14:36,300
It's time to choose and eat the snacks.

1934
01:14:41,170 --> 01:14:43,000
Everything's good, but I recommend the fish-shaped bun.

1935
01:14:43,000 --> 01:14:44,470
What about this? Is this good?

1936
01:14:45,810 --> 01:14:46,970
Maybe sugar?

1937
01:14:47,240 --> 01:14:48,680
Sugar candy.

1938
01:14:48,680 --> 01:14:50,380
- Korean candy. - Okay.

1939
01:14:50,380 --> 01:14:51,980
- I'm going with this then. - Okay.

1940
01:14:52,480 --> 01:14:54,250
- Good choice. - Yes?

1941
01:14:54,250 --> 01:14:57,120
- You can only take one. - I want that to swim into my body.

1942
01:14:57,120 --> 01:14:58,590
He has to try the fish-shaped bun.

1943
01:14:58,590 --> 01:15:00,620
- Fish burger? - Fish burger for the winter.

1944
01:15:00,920 --> 01:15:02,190
Fish burger?

1945
01:15:02,190 --> 01:15:03,960
- Who said "fish burger?" - Fish.

1946
01:15:04,330 --> 01:15:06,290
We'll do fish-shaped bun and the candy.

1947
01:15:10,560 --> 01:15:11,570
Try.

1948
01:15:12,130 --> 01:15:16,100
- Korean style. - Korean style.

1949
01:15:24,610 --> 01:15:26,110
This is good.

1950
01:15:26,180 --> 01:15:27,420
- Super good. - I really like this.

1951
01:15:27,420 --> 01:15:28,980
- Cheers. - Cheers.

1952
01:15:28,980 --> 01:15:30,420
- It's warm. - It's lukewarm.

1953
01:15:30,420 --> 01:15:31,550
As long as it's good.

1954
01:15:31,550 --> 01:15:32,820
I really like fish-shaped buns.

1955
01:15:32,820 --> 01:15:34,560
This is like a waffle.

1956
01:15:35,320 --> 01:15:37,830
- Super good. - This is so yummy.

1957
01:15:38,030 --> 01:15:39,230
Love it.

1958
01:15:39,230 --> 01:15:40,860
Actually, no. I don't like it.

1959
01:15:44,470 --> 01:15:45,900
- He's good. - He's funny.

1960
01:15:45,900 --> 01:15:47,100
Until the end.

1961
01:15:47,740 --> 01:15:48,770
I want to eat.

1962
01:15:48,770 --> 01:15:51,110
- This is my favorite... - Fish-shaped bun.

1963
01:15:51,110 --> 01:15:52,170
winter snack.

1964
01:15:52,170 --> 01:15:53,540
It's different, no?

1965
01:15:55,110 --> 01:15:56,710
- Is it good? - Use your hand.

1966
01:15:56,740 --> 01:15:57,980
It's like something you've never...

1967
01:15:57,980 --> 01:15:59,880
- It's so interesting. - had before.

1968
01:15:59,880 --> 01:16:01,320
I really like that.

1969
01:16:02,120 --> 01:16:03,680
- What are these called? - It's not too sweet.

1970
01:16:03,980 --> 01:16:06,620
- Ggultarae. - Ggultarae.

1971
01:16:06,620 --> 01:16:09,160
- Yes. Ggultarae. - Ggultarae.

1972
01:16:09,160 --> 01:16:10,360
- Right, ggultarae. - Ggultarae.

1973
01:16:10,490 --> 01:16:12,460
This is the final game.

1974
01:16:12,790 --> 01:16:14,930
The ghosts' names should not go on this roulette...

1975
01:16:14,930 --> 01:16:17,360
if the other members don't want the penalty.

1976
01:16:17,360 --> 01:16:19,600
Pick four people who are unlikely to be ghosts and put...

1977
01:16:19,600 --> 01:16:21,070
- their names on the roulette. - I have no idea.

1978
01:16:21,070 --> 01:16:22,400
- Who do you think it is? - You can ask.

1979
01:16:22,740 --> 01:16:25,670
Who do you think did bad on purpose?

1980
01:16:25,970 --> 01:16:29,940
- He's the ghost. - Ghost?

1981
01:16:29,940 --> 01:16:33,080
- Ryan thinks you're the ghost. - 100 percent, guaranteed.

1982
01:16:33,680 --> 01:16:35,380
- Me too. - I agree.

1983
01:16:35,380 --> 01:16:37,490
- And he's the ghost. - Same here.

1984
01:16:37,620 --> 01:16:39,650
- Yes. Do you need any help? - Why?

1985
01:16:40,020 --> 01:16:41,820
- This is really frustrating. - That's how you feel?

1986
01:16:41,820 --> 01:16:43,420
- Are you the ghost? - No.

1987
01:16:44,120 --> 01:16:45,290
I'm human.

1988
01:16:46,990 --> 01:16:48,400
Old guy.

1989
01:16:48,400 --> 01:16:49,660
- You? - No, no.

1990
01:16:50,500 --> 01:16:51,970
- Ghost. - Yes.

1991
01:16:51,970 --> 01:16:53,000
- Yes. - Ghost?

1992
01:16:53,000 --> 01:16:54,670
He's a bad liar.

1993
01:16:56,640 --> 01:16:58,710
- Ghost? - I think...

1994
01:16:58,710 --> 01:17:00,540
- Jae Suk and Jong Kook. - Kim and you.

1995
01:17:00,540 --> 01:17:02,380
There's somebody on this team too.

1996
01:17:02,380 --> 01:17:03,910
Ryan's convinced.

1997
01:17:03,910 --> 01:17:05,850
- Let's go with that. - Okay. Go.

1998
01:17:05,850 --> 01:17:07,780
Don't do Haha.

1999
01:17:07,780 --> 01:17:09,380
- It's not me. - It's not him.

2000
01:17:15,760 --> 01:17:18,390
Bring in the penalty cards.

2001
01:17:23,230 --> 01:17:26,170
- Pick one. - Pick.

2002
01:17:26,170 --> 01:17:27,430
What will he pick?

2003
01:17:27,430 --> 01:17:28,800
As long as it's not the water cannon.

2004
01:17:29,440 --> 01:17:31,070
That's the worst.

2005
01:17:31,970 --> 01:17:33,010
That's the worst.

2006
01:17:37,340 --> 01:17:38,550
- What is it? - What is it?

2007
01:17:40,550 --> 01:17:42,980
- A wig? - With a wig on?

2008
01:17:42,980 --> 01:17:45,220
- With a wig on? - Pressure point massage with a wig.

2009
01:17:47,520 --> 01:17:50,060
This is doable.

2010
01:17:50,060 --> 01:17:51,560
- This is good. - It's doable.

2011
01:17:51,860 --> 01:17:54,160
Good job. He's good.

2012
01:17:54,160 --> 01:17:55,700
He doesn't just hold it.

2013
01:17:55,700 --> 01:17:57,030
He's really good.

2014
01:17:57,030 --> 01:17:58,830
I really want Ryan.

2015
01:18:00,870 --> 01:18:03,940
You just have to spin the roulette now.

2016
01:18:04,570 --> 01:18:07,840
After spinning the roulette, if a ghost is one of the names...

2017
01:18:07,980 --> 01:18:10,840
that lands on the penalty spot, the ghosts win.

2018
01:18:10,840 --> 01:18:11,850
- Right. - Right.

2019
01:18:11,850 --> 01:18:13,950
If there are no ghosts, Running Man wins.

2020
01:18:13,950 --> 01:18:15,050
- Yes. - Yes.

2021
01:18:15,050 --> 01:18:18,550
For your information, on the roulette,

2022
01:18:18,550 --> 01:18:19,990
the ghosts...

2023
01:18:22,160 --> 01:18:23,720
- Are there ghosts? - Yes.

2024
01:18:23,720 --> 01:18:25,290
- There are? - Really? Who?

2025
01:18:25,290 --> 01:18:26,430
Is it Jong Kook?

2026
01:18:26,430 --> 01:18:28,360
- Jong Kook. - It's not me.

2027
01:18:28,360 --> 01:18:29,460
Should we spin it?

2028
01:18:29,460 --> 01:18:32,200
- 1, 2, 3. Go! - 2, 3. Go!

2029
01:18:34,000 --> 01:18:36,100
You said there are ghosts on this,

2030
01:18:36,100 --> 01:18:37,710
but they're not in every space.

2031
01:18:37,710 --> 01:18:39,710
It's pressure point massage wearing a wig.

2032
01:18:52,990 --> 01:18:54,720
It's Suk Jin and Haha.

2033
01:18:55,790 --> 01:18:57,360
It's Suk Jin, Haha, Kwang Soo, and So Min.

2034
01:18:57,360 --> 01:18:58,390
See?

2035
01:18:58,390 --> 01:19:04,300
People included are Suk Jin, Haha, Kwang Soo, and So Min.

2036
01:19:04,300 --> 01:19:06,330
- People who are included. - I only had one name tag.

2037
01:19:06,330 --> 01:19:07,800
That was close.

2038
01:19:10,840 --> 01:19:12,870
- Out of the four of them... - I think you're right.

2039
01:19:12,870 --> 01:19:14,480
- There are ghosts. - It's you.

2040
01:19:14,480 --> 01:19:16,010
- It's you, right? - It's So Min.

2041
01:19:16,010 --> 01:19:18,010
You're smiling. Look. You can't hide it. You look happy.

2042
01:19:18,010 --> 01:19:19,210
Are there any ghosts?

2043
01:19:22,680 --> 01:19:24,790
There are none.

2044
01:19:25,850 --> 01:19:27,790
- I told you. It's not me. - Is that good?

2045
01:19:27,790 --> 01:19:29,590
- Good. - Don't ever doubt me again.

2046
01:19:29,590 --> 01:19:30,660
- Who is it then? - Who is it?

2047
01:19:30,660 --> 01:19:32,660
- Today's ghosts are... - He's drinking water.

2048
01:19:32,660 --> 01:19:33,990
- It's Jae Suk. - Jae Suk and...

2049
01:19:34,460 --> 01:19:36,230
- It's Jae Suk. - Jae Suk and...

2050
01:19:39,730 --> 01:19:44,440
- Jae Suk and Jong Kook. - Right!

2051
01:19:44,440 --> 01:19:45,840
- That's what I said. - Me too.

2052
01:19:45,840 --> 01:19:48,110
- See? That's what I said. - You were precisely right.

2053
01:19:48,110 --> 01:19:49,210
He was really good.

2054
01:19:49,380 --> 01:19:50,840
You were precisely right.

2055
01:19:51,050 --> 01:19:52,710
- I knew it. - How did you know?

2056
01:19:52,710 --> 01:19:54,950
- How did Ryan know? - I just looked at him. You're it.

2057
01:19:54,950 --> 01:19:56,180
- How did she know? - I'm a psychic.

2058
01:19:57,320 --> 01:19:58,690
You two are...

2059
01:19:58,990 --> 01:20:00,720
ghosts today.

2060
01:20:00,720 --> 01:20:01,790
- What? - Pardon?

2061
01:20:01,920 --> 01:20:04,220
It's been a while since we've been on the same team.

2062
01:20:04,220 --> 01:20:06,060
We don't fail when we are on the same team.

2063
01:20:06,060 --> 01:20:08,030
We never fail when we are together.

2064
01:20:08,100 --> 01:20:10,100
But I feel bad.

2065
01:20:10,400 --> 01:20:13,070
Suk Jin lives closest to here.

2066
01:20:15,840 --> 01:20:17,340
You have to put it on properly.

2067
01:20:17,340 --> 01:20:18,540
Jong Kook,

2068
01:20:18,540 --> 01:20:20,740
you're not going to shut our business, right?

2069
01:20:20,740 --> 01:20:22,280
That was pretty intense.

2070
01:20:22,280 --> 01:20:24,680
- That was really bad. - Mr. Jong Kook.

2071
01:20:24,680 --> 01:20:28,180
It was for a short time,

2072
01:20:28,180 --> 01:20:30,220
- but they were really involved. - I agree.

2073
01:20:30,250 --> 01:20:31,950
We had so much fun.

2074
01:20:31,950 --> 01:20:34,250
Please say a few words for us.

2075
01:20:34,250 --> 01:20:36,720
- The best. - It was so much fun.

2076
01:20:37,390 --> 01:20:39,460
It's going to be very hard to do another TV show.

2077
01:20:39,460 --> 01:20:41,200
- We're going to be so bored. - I know.

2078
01:20:41,200 --> 01:20:44,300
Every other TV show after this is going to be terrible for us.

2079
01:20:45,570 --> 01:20:47,740
- Thank you. - It was so much fun.

2080
01:20:47,940 --> 01:20:50,740
Can we invite you again next time you come to Korea?

2081
01:20:50,740 --> 01:20:52,070
- Yes. - Of course.

2082
01:20:53,570 --> 01:20:55,380
Yes. Heck, yes.

2083
01:20:55,380 --> 01:20:58,310
We prepared gifts for them.

2084
01:21:00,950 --> 01:21:02,280
- Your name. - It's symbolic.

2085
01:21:02,280 --> 01:21:04,220
- This is our sign. - That's nice.

2086
01:21:04,220 --> 01:21:05,720
- Name tag. - We always use this.

2087
01:21:06,050 --> 01:21:07,690
Adria Arjona.

2088
01:21:07,960 --> 01:21:09,360
Melanie Laurent.

2089
01:21:10,390 --> 01:21:12,090
- Thank you so much. - I love it.

2090
01:21:12,090 --> 01:21:13,530
- Thank you, guys. - This is meaningful.

2091
01:21:18,970 --> 01:21:20,530
Set, go.

2092
01:21:21,840 --> 01:21:23,400
- Why? - This is really painful.

2093
01:21:23,400 --> 01:21:25,040
- This is so painful. - It's just for five seconds.

2094
01:21:25,040 --> 01:21:26,970
My hip will break.

2095
01:21:26,970 --> 01:21:29,240
- It's a massage. - It's good for your health.

2096
01:21:29,240 --> 01:21:30,880
Who becomes healthy like this?

2097
01:21:30,880 --> 01:21:32,550
Shut your mouth and just do it!

2098
01:21:32,550 --> 01:21:34,520
He doesn't care about our health. He's here to kill us.

2099
01:21:34,520 --> 01:21:36,480
- This is not good for your health. - That's not true.

2100
01:21:36,480 --> 01:21:38,290
- This is painful. - He's relaxing your muscles.

2101
01:21:38,290 --> 01:21:39,590
- Set, go. - I don't think so.

2102
01:21:39,590 --> 01:21:41,190
1, 2,

2103
01:21:41,190 --> 01:21:42,790
- He has to start again. - three,

2104
01:21:43,590 --> 01:21:45,490
- four, - Again.

2105
01:21:49,430 --> 01:21:50,830
Ready.

2106
01:21:50,830 --> 01:21:52,200
Set, go.

2107
01:21:52,500 --> 01:21:53,870
- Doesn't that hurt? - Two,

2108
01:21:53,870 --> 01:21:55,170
- He's enduring it. - three,

2109
01:21:55,170 --> 01:21:56,640
3, 4...

2110
01:21:56,640 --> 01:21:58,010
- He's incredible. - He's determined.

2111
01:21:59,840 --> 01:22:01,310
- Jae Suk flopped all over. - Wasn't that painful?

2112
01:22:01,410 --> 01:22:02,740
He took it seriously.

2113
01:22:02,740 --> 01:22:04,080
He was like a fish out of water.

2114
01:22:04,610 --> 01:22:07,820
The Ggannes Film Festival opened in Sangam-dong, Seoul.

2115
01:22:07,820 --> 01:22:10,450
- It's a film festival today. - Actors from Korea...

2116
01:22:10,450 --> 01:22:13,890
- and around the world are here. - It's Jun Hyo Seong and Yoyomi.

2117
01:22:13,890 --> 01:22:15,620
They're so funny.

2118
01:22:15,860 --> 01:22:17,760
- I can't get it on. - No!

2119
01:22:17,990 --> 01:22:21,430
- That was great acting. - This is a mess.

2120
01:22:21,430 --> 01:22:23,300
- Okay. Do it. - I won't lose.

2121
01:22:24,830 --> 01:22:27,430
- A blooper on TV? - A broadcasting accident?

2122
01:22:28,200 --> 01:22:29,640
Everybody's in danger.

2123
01:22:29,640 --> 01:22:31,310
- Why is she making that face? - Why did you do that?

2124
01:22:31,370 --> 01:22:32,670
This has to be the producer.

2125
01:22:35,810 --> 01:22:37,080
I got goosebumps.
