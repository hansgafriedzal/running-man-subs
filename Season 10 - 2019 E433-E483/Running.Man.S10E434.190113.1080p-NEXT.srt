1
00:00:06,780 --> 00:00:09,379
(Last week)

2
00:00:10,850 --> 00:00:13,889
(New Year Project: RPG Project, Level Up Project)

3
00:00:14,020 --> 00:00:17,460
(When a member reaches Level 10, the member wins the race.)

4
00:00:17,460 --> 00:00:20,360
(Forming clans is very important in completing the quests.)

5
00:00:20,360 --> 00:00:24,160
(And last week, 4 clans have been formed.)

6
00:00:24,730 --> 00:00:26,629
(Jong Kook and So Min, Seok Jin and Kwang Soo,)

7
00:00:26,629 --> 00:00:28,370
(Ji Hyo and Se Chan, Jae Seok and Haha)

8
00:00:29,370 --> 00:00:30,469
(Attention, members of Running Man!)

9
00:00:31,140 --> 00:00:33,569
(Turn on the camera we gave you right now.)

10
00:00:34,270 --> 00:00:37,410
(Are they receiving the instructions as the program airs?)

11
00:00:37,410 --> 00:00:38,840
Turn the volume up.

12
00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:43,410
Text one of the secrets of your clan to the main producer.

13
00:00:43,410 --> 00:00:44,620
Let me see.

14
00:00:45,279 --> 00:00:46,319
Secret?

15
00:00:46,319 --> 00:00:47,590
(Text my clan's secret?)

16
00:00:47,749 --> 00:00:52,620
(Text one of the secrets of your clan to the main producer.)

17
00:00:52,919 --> 00:00:56,129
You will receive amazing benefits in the order the texts arrive.

18
00:00:57,459 --> 00:00:58,629
What is that?

19
00:00:58,629 --> 00:00:59,700
(The faster I text, the bigger the benefit is?)

20
00:00:59,700 --> 00:01:00,700
My clan's secret?

21
00:01:00,700 --> 00:01:02,429
Seok Jin... Seok Jin's secret?

22
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:08,010
(4 clans were formed last week.)

23
00:01:08,510 --> 00:01:13,279
(Let's see. Ji Hyo's secret?)

24
00:01:13,279 --> 00:01:14,450
- Hello? - Kwang Soo.

25
00:01:14,450 --> 00:01:16,150
Wait. What is this?

26
00:01:16,350 --> 00:01:18,480
Kwang Soo, tell me Ji Hyo's secret.

27
00:01:18,480 --> 00:01:20,350
(He asks for a secret out of nowhere.)

28
00:01:20,350 --> 00:01:22,450
Hey, Ji Hyo's existence itself is a secret.

29
00:01:22,950 --> 00:01:24,159
How could I know her secret?

30
00:01:24,419 --> 00:01:26,760
If I know her secret, would that be a secret?

31
00:01:26,760 --> 00:01:28,490
But still, Kwang Soo.

32
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:30,730
Or should I ask her closest friend that I know of?

33
00:01:30,999 --> 00:01:32,799
You should ask Seong Moon. Seong Moon.

34
00:01:32,799 --> 00:01:34,630
(Yes, I can ask Seong Moon.)

35
00:01:34,730 --> 00:01:35,930
Yes, I can do that.

36
00:01:35,930 --> 00:01:37,100
Do you have his number?

37
00:01:37,939 --> 00:01:39,669
- I'll text you his number. - Yes, please.

38
00:01:40,070 --> 00:01:41,210
- Okay. - Okay.

39
00:01:41,210 --> 00:01:42,469
(He acquires Ji Hyo's brother's phone number.)

40
00:01:42,469 --> 00:01:44,109
Yes, I could ask Seong Moon.

41
00:01:44,579 --> 00:01:46,040
Okay. I got one.

42
00:01:46,980 --> 00:01:48,010
(He plans to text Se Chan late.)

43
00:01:48,010 --> 00:01:49,579
While he waits for me to send him the number...

44
00:01:49,579 --> 00:01:51,480
(He will text Seok Jin's secret before texting Se Chan.)

45
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:53,219
I should send Seok Jin's secret first.

46
00:01:53,990 --> 00:01:55,350
My clan member, Kwang Soo.

47
00:01:55,719 --> 00:01:57,490
(Which secret should I share?)

48
00:01:57,490 --> 00:01:59,019
Gosh, I shouldn't share this.

49
00:01:59,590 --> 00:02:00,829
Se Chan and I...

50
00:02:00,829 --> 00:02:01,960
(The faster it is, the more advantageous it is.)

51
00:02:01,960 --> 00:02:03,460
A mutual friend of Se Chan and I...

52
00:02:03,529 --> 00:02:04,799
(Who shared which secret first?)

53
00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:06,829
That mutual friend of us told me this.

54
00:02:06,829 --> 00:02:09,269
(Who shared which secret first?)

55
00:02:10,639 --> 00:02:11,899
What are you doing?

56
00:02:11,899 --> 00:02:12,940
(Contemplating)

57
00:02:12,940 --> 00:02:13,940
Hold on.

58
00:02:14,769 --> 00:02:16,410
(At that time...)

59
00:02:16,410 --> 00:02:17,510
Here it is.

60
00:02:17,510 --> 00:02:18,810
(Did the first secret arrive?)

61
00:02:18,810 --> 00:02:20,109
The first member to send a text message is...

62
00:02:20,109 --> 00:02:21,609
(The 1st one to share a secret is...)

63
00:02:21,609 --> 00:02:22,750
So Min.

64
00:02:22,750 --> 00:02:23,780
(It is as expected.)

65
00:02:23,780 --> 00:02:25,179
Jong Kook's secret is...

66
00:02:25,179 --> 00:02:28,950
(She is the 1st one to text her clan member's secret.)

67
00:02:28,950 --> 00:02:30,459
- Yes. - You have acquired...

68
00:02:30,459 --> 00:02:32,060
80 dollars for the mission budget.

69
00:02:32,060 --> 00:02:33,419
(She receives the highest budget, 80 dollars.)

70
00:02:33,419 --> 00:02:35,160
- 80 dollars? Is that the highest? - Yes.

71
00:02:35,530 --> 00:02:37,260
80 dollars are given to the first member.

72
00:02:37,660 --> 00:02:39,760
Haha, you were the second member to text a secret.

73
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:41,799
(Haha was the 2nd member.)

74
00:02:41,799 --> 00:02:43,700
You have acquired 70 dollars...

75
00:02:43,700 --> 00:02:45,570
- for the mission budget. - 70 dollars?

76
00:02:45,869 --> 00:02:48,739
You were the third member to send the text message, Ji Hyo.

77
00:02:49,209 --> 00:02:52,440
You have acquired 60 dollars for the mission budget.

78
00:02:53,109 --> 00:02:54,209
Really?

79
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:55,480
But you know what?

80
00:02:55,480 --> 00:02:57,750
Se Chan might beat me to death.

81
00:02:57,750 --> 00:02:58,820
(It's for exposing his secret.)

82
00:02:59,350 --> 00:03:00,489
I'm in trouble.

83
00:03:01,320 --> 00:03:03,820
(The order of the mission budgets goes as So Min, Haha,)

84
00:03:03,820 --> 00:03:06,359
(Ji Hyo, Seok Jin, Kwang Soo, Jae Seok, Se Chan, and Jong Kook.)

85
00:03:06,519 --> 00:03:12,299
(The second day of Running Man Playing Game has dawned.)

86
00:03:12,660 --> 00:03:13,799
(Jamsil Indoor Gymnasium)

87
00:03:13,799 --> 00:03:15,000
- Hello. - Hello.

88
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,169
- Hi. - Is this a press conference?

89
00:03:16,269 --> 00:03:17,570
- What is this? - Hello.

90
00:03:17,570 --> 00:03:18,739
What's going on here?

91
00:03:18,739 --> 00:03:20,299
- Look at this. - I saw this coming.

92
00:03:20,399 --> 00:03:22,570
- Kwang Soo will have it here. - No, no.

93
00:03:22,709 --> 00:03:24,980
- Kwang Soo. - He'll hold the press conference.

94
00:03:24,980 --> 00:03:26,980
- Make your official comment. - Gosh, you romantic.

95
00:03:27,179 --> 00:03:28,280
What official comment?

96
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:30,280
- Hey, we're doing this for you. - No, no.

97
00:03:30,310 --> 00:03:31,679
- Gosh, you romantic. - What official comment?

98
00:03:31,750 --> 00:03:33,549
Hey, we're doing this for you.

99
00:03:33,549 --> 00:03:35,290
- Hey, sit in the center. - Of course.

100
00:03:35,290 --> 00:03:36,589
Come here. Sit in the middle.

101
00:03:36,589 --> 00:03:37,790
- Come here. - Hello.

102
00:03:37,790 --> 00:03:38,989
- Sit in the middle. - No, no.

103
00:03:38,989 --> 00:03:40,359
- Why would I sit in the middle? - Hurry, and sit down.

104
00:03:40,359 --> 00:03:41,859
(Why would I sit in the middle?)

105
00:03:41,859 --> 00:03:43,030
I've never sat in the middle.

106
00:03:43,030 --> 00:03:44,799
- What a sight. - Just sit next to Jae Seok now.

107
00:03:44,799 --> 00:03:45,859
Sit down.

108
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:47,230
Sit in the middle.

109
00:03:47,230 --> 00:03:48,700
- Sit down. - Take a seat.

110
00:03:49,269 --> 00:03:50,570
Happy New Year.

111
00:03:50,570 --> 00:03:53,139
- Happy New Year. - Happy New Year.

112
00:03:53,139 --> 00:03:54,239
Happy New Year.

113
00:03:54,239 --> 00:03:56,209
(It's gotten quiet all of a sudden.)

114
00:03:57,010 --> 00:03:59,010
(Let's see...)

115
00:03:59,010 --> 00:04:02,179
(How should we approach this subject?)

116
00:04:04,079 --> 00:04:05,480
Yes, that's true. He's dating her.

117
00:04:05,480 --> 00:04:07,220
- Yes! - Wait.

118
00:04:07,549 --> 00:04:09,950
("His Close Friend Confirms the Relationship")

119
00:04:09,950 --> 00:04:11,459
- Yes, they are dating now! - Congratulations.

120
00:04:11,459 --> 00:04:12,459
He's the giraffe in love!

121
00:04:12,459 --> 00:04:13,790
(Are they going to do it like this?)

122
00:04:13,790 --> 00:04:15,829
She starred on Running Man as a guest.

123
00:04:15,829 --> 00:04:17,800
- Right. - Lee Sun Bin and Kwang Soo...

124
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:19,700
- developed a special relationship. - My gosh.

125
00:04:19,700 --> 00:04:21,899
How long have you two been dating?

126
00:04:21,899 --> 00:04:24,000
- Please tell us how you feel now. - Why are we doing this now?

127
00:04:24,099 --> 00:04:25,769
We're in the middle of our opening segment.

128
00:04:25,769 --> 00:04:27,269
- Why are we doing this? - This is our opening segment.

129
00:04:27,269 --> 00:04:29,010
- A lot of agencies came by the way. - Right.

130
00:04:29,010 --> 00:04:30,409
As you can see,

131
00:04:30,409 --> 00:04:32,409
there are SBS, SBS2,

132
00:04:32,409 --> 00:04:34,079
- and another SBS agency. - They are all from SBS?

133
00:04:34,479 --> 00:04:35,849
- SBS Plus. - SBS MTV.

134
00:04:35,909 --> 00:04:37,180
- They are all from SBS. - Right.

135
00:04:37,219 --> 00:04:39,849
- Actually, when I read the article, - Okay.

136
00:04:40,079 --> 00:04:41,920
- I was the most worried about... - Okay.

137
00:04:43,190 --> 00:04:49,589
(What was he worried about the most after reading the article?)

138
00:04:49,589 --> 00:04:51,029
"Gosh, how am I going to get through Monday?"

139
00:04:51,300 --> 00:04:52,430
That crossed my mind first.

140
00:04:52,430 --> 00:04:54,829
(Monday is their day of shooting.)

141
00:04:55,370 --> 00:04:56,729
I am going to overcome that big hardship.

142
00:04:56,729 --> 00:04:58,440
- I see. - I braced myself.

143
00:04:58,440 --> 00:05:00,810
- To talk more about this... - I'll overcome it.

144
00:05:00,810 --> 00:05:02,440
Kwang Soo, I'm curious about how you must feel now.

145
00:05:02,440 --> 00:05:05,339
- We'll listen to how you feel now. - Okay.

146
00:05:05,810 --> 00:05:07,010
(Hesitant)

147
00:05:07,010 --> 00:05:09,279
- We don't have time. Hurry. - Come on, tell us.

148
00:05:09,950 --> 00:05:11,279
Thank you.

149
00:05:12,079 --> 00:05:13,950
Are you dating her now? Do you love her?

150
00:05:13,950 --> 00:05:15,649
- Is it true you two are dating? - When did it start?

151
00:05:15,649 --> 00:05:17,089
- How much do you love her? - How long has it been?

152
00:05:17,519 --> 00:05:18,959
(You should answer this.)

153
00:05:18,959 --> 00:05:20,260
- Is it true you two are dating? - When did it start?

154
00:05:20,260 --> 00:05:22,430
(They are full of curiosity.)

155
00:05:22,430 --> 00:05:23,589
Ask one at a time!

156
00:05:23,589 --> 00:05:26,500
(My gosh, ask one at a time!)

157
00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:28,300
Attack me one at a time.

158
00:05:28,630 --> 00:05:31,339
- We'll attack one at a time. - All right.

159
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:32,769
- I mean... - Right now,

160
00:05:32,769 --> 00:05:35,039
- Let me deal with them one by one. - I'm sure you must have questions.

161
00:05:35,570 --> 00:05:37,209
I have something to brag about.

162
00:05:37,209 --> 00:05:38,240
- What is it? - Okay.

163
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:39,779
I was the one who brought them together.

164
00:05:40,810 --> 00:05:42,050
(I was the one who brought them together.)

165
00:05:42,050 --> 00:05:43,310
- What? - Really?

166
00:05:43,880 --> 00:05:45,849
I was the one who gave the number.

167
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:48,190
- You did that, So Min? - You set them up together.

168
00:05:48,190 --> 00:05:49,690
This proves that So Min and Kwang Soo's relationship...

169
00:05:49,690 --> 00:05:52,289
- was strictly business. - That's right.

170
00:05:52,289 --> 00:05:54,959
- It was strictly business. - That's right.

171
00:05:54,959 --> 00:05:56,289
("Their Relationship Was Strictly Business")

172
00:05:56,389 --> 00:05:57,630
- Please don't get the wrong idea. - Right.

173
00:05:58,529 --> 00:06:01,029
All right. I'm sure you must have a lot of questions.

174
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:02,500
We'll ask questions one at a time.

175
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:03,969
This is for the viewers of Running Man,

176
00:06:03,969 --> 00:06:05,940
fans who love our show,

177
00:06:05,940 --> 00:06:08,139
- and viewers who were... - That's right.

178
00:06:08,139 --> 00:06:10,339
- interested in Kwang Soo. - Yes, of course.

179
00:06:10,339 --> 00:06:12,909
- They might not watch our shows, - That's true.

180
00:06:12,909 --> 00:06:15,279
- but some are watching for this. - Of course.

181
00:06:15,279 --> 00:06:17,849
That's the thing about these days. A long time ago...

182
00:06:17,849 --> 00:06:19,550
Jae Seok, stop talking, and let him talk!

183
00:06:19,550 --> 00:06:21,050
(Jae Seok, stop talking, and let him talk!)

184
00:06:21,050 --> 00:06:24,089
(Please stop talking, Jae Seok!)

185
00:06:24,089 --> 00:06:25,490
- Are they dating or not? - I agree!

186
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:27,430
- You got that right! - Hey, hey.

187
00:06:27,789 --> 00:06:29,029
You don't have to.

188
00:06:29,329 --> 00:06:30,560
- Okay. - I'm sorry.

189
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:32,800
- I like these scandals. - He's excited.

190
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:34,800
- Jae Seok is excited more than him. - He really likes these scandals.

191
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:37,200
- Jae Seok... He's excited. - He has to get the vibe going.

192
00:06:37,639 --> 00:06:39,240
- Jae Seok is excited more than him. - I am...

193
00:06:39,399 --> 00:06:41,039
really happy...

194
00:06:41,039 --> 00:06:43,139
when something like this happens to...

195
00:06:43,139 --> 00:06:44,709
- people around me. - Right.

196
00:06:44,709 --> 00:06:46,639
- This is a happy occasion. - I'm so elated.

197
00:06:46,639 --> 00:06:50,450
He was the one who was continuing the character of the playboy.

198
00:06:50,450 --> 00:06:51,920
What will you do with that?

199
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:53,820
Will you hand over your character to Se Chan?

200
00:06:53,950 --> 00:06:55,250
- I'd like to give it a try. - We...

201
00:06:55,250 --> 00:06:56,320
(Feeling confident)

202
00:06:56,789 --> 00:06:58,589
(I'll take that role.)

203
00:06:58,589 --> 00:06:59,620
- She'll be the first female. - Right.

204
00:06:59,620 --> 00:07:01,260
- Yes, So Min can pull it off. - I can do that.

205
00:07:01,260 --> 00:07:03,060
- I think she can do it. - Yes, it works.

206
00:07:03,159 --> 00:07:04,800
Actually, she might suit the character...

207
00:07:05,500 --> 00:07:07,570
- better than Se Chan. - Yes, let me try that.

208
00:07:07,570 --> 00:07:09,070
- It will suit her well. - She's a romantic too.

209
00:07:09,070 --> 00:07:10,229
(Look forward to Lover Frog's endeavor.)

210
00:07:10,229 --> 00:07:11,440
Great.

211
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:12,870
What did you do on your 100th day?

212
00:07:12,969 --> 00:07:14,370
- That was sudden. - That was sudden.

213
00:07:14,469 --> 00:07:15,810
What did you do on your 100th day?

214
00:07:16,170 --> 00:07:17,579
(My 100th day with her?)

215
00:07:17,579 --> 00:07:18,839
Jae Seok is leading the interview.

216
00:07:18,839 --> 00:07:20,110
- Don't answer it. - Okay.

217
00:07:20,110 --> 00:07:21,409
Tell him, no comment.

218
00:07:22,310 --> 00:07:23,479
On your 100th day...

219
00:07:23,709 --> 00:07:25,950
No comment. I heard that you do this too on your radio show.

220
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:28,120
I'm curious about your 100th day.

221
00:07:28,190 --> 00:07:29,289
What did you do on that day?

222
00:07:29,719 --> 00:07:33,060
Actually, both of us aren't big on celebrating anniversaries.

223
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:35,529
You should have told me. I would've given you 10 cents.

224
00:07:35,760 --> 00:07:36,789
You give out 10 cents on 100th day?

225
00:07:36,789 --> 00:07:38,360
(He can't believe his ears.)

226
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:39,599
- Gosh, that was so long time ago. - You should've told me.

227
00:07:39,860 --> 00:07:41,200
We used to say that in elementary school.

228
00:07:41,769 --> 00:07:43,000
Gosh, he's such an oldie.

229
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,170
Gosh, that was ages ago.

230
00:07:44,170 --> 00:07:45,940
- I would've given you 10 cents. - What about the 22nd day?

231
00:07:45,940 --> 00:07:47,409
- Jong Kook. - And your 22nd day.

232
00:07:47,409 --> 00:07:49,610
- You gave 100 folded crane eggs. - Exactly.

233
00:07:50,209 --> 00:07:53,180
We'll give you 70 cents to you later.

234
00:07:54,349 --> 00:07:55,880
Just like we said earlier,

235
00:07:55,950 --> 00:07:58,680
please tell us how you want this relationship to blossom.

236
00:07:58,880 --> 00:08:00,050
- In the future? - Yes.

237
00:08:00,050 --> 00:08:02,219
- Tell us about your plan. - Yes, tell us.

238
00:08:02,219 --> 00:08:04,389
- There are many types of love. - Yes.

239
00:08:04,490 --> 00:08:06,560
- Tell us what type of love it is. - What is your definition of love?

240
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:07,630
Okay.

241
00:08:07,630 --> 00:08:10,360
A lot of people were interested in this and encouraged me.

242
00:08:10,459 --> 00:08:12,060
Actually, love scandals can be...

243
00:08:12,060 --> 00:08:13,500
Hey, let him talk.

244
00:08:13,700 --> 00:08:15,399
Actually, love scandals can be...

245
00:08:15,599 --> 00:08:16,729
(They are frustrated.)

246
00:08:17,029 --> 00:08:18,170
Let him finish.

247
00:08:18,170 --> 00:08:19,940
- Gosh, this is driving me crazy. - We didn't hear a thing from him.

248
00:08:19,940 --> 00:08:22,139
We didn't hear a thing from him.

249
00:08:22,139 --> 00:08:23,810
- I don't want you to misunderstand. - Okay.

250
00:08:23,810 --> 00:08:25,110
- After two days, - That's true.

251
00:08:25,110 --> 00:08:26,979
- people don't pay attention. - Right, right.

252
00:08:26,979 --> 00:08:29,680
You shouldn't say something that might cause a misunderstanding.

253
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:31,420
- Okay. - The news didn't garner...

254
00:08:31,420 --> 00:08:32,579
- that much attention though. - No, it didn't.

255
00:08:32,879 --> 00:08:35,749
(Laughing)

256
00:08:36,020 --> 00:08:38,060
All you need is love

257
00:08:38,060 --> 00:08:39,489
(He takes the microphone all of a sudden.)

258
00:08:39,489 --> 00:08:42,259
(Suddenly, he starts singing a love song.)

259
00:08:42,259 --> 00:08:45,859
(What does Kwang Soo need now?)

260
00:08:45,859 --> 00:08:46,999
Stop it! Please!

261
00:08:47,670 --> 00:08:49,300
- I'm sorry! - All you need is love

262
00:08:49,300 --> 00:08:51,940
(This is a festival! They can't hear a thing.)

263
00:08:51,940 --> 00:08:54,570
(We support your love, Kwang Soo.)

264
00:08:54,570 --> 00:08:56,009
(Gosh, these members.)

265
00:08:56,109 --> 00:08:57,270
Love story!

266
00:08:57,270 --> 00:08:59,979
(Every conversation ends with the topic of love.)

267
00:08:59,979 --> 00:09:01,709
- Congratulations! - Congratulations!

268
00:09:01,979 --> 00:09:03,810
Congratulations, Kwang Soo.

269
00:09:04,680 --> 00:09:06,680
Congratulations on your new relationship.

270
00:09:06,680 --> 00:09:07,950
(May your relationship last forever.)

271
00:09:08,050 --> 00:09:10,450
All right. Next up is Haha, the father of three children.

272
00:09:10,450 --> 00:09:12,190
My gosh, we should hear more about his story.

273
00:09:12,359 --> 00:09:13,790
- Come here. - My gosh.

274
00:09:14,129 --> 00:09:16,229
We have a lot of happy occasions today.

275
00:09:16,229 --> 00:09:18,129
We finished Kwang Soo's story too quickly.

276
00:09:18,129 --> 00:09:19,430
(Finally, I'm done.)

277
00:09:19,430 --> 00:09:20,900
(Haha moves to the center after Kwang Soo.)

278
00:09:20,900 --> 00:09:22,099
- Goodness. - This is nice.

279
00:09:22,099 --> 00:09:23,829
- Haha was a real man! - No.

280
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:25,739
Real man, Haha!

281
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:27,170
- Hey, by the way... - I'm jealous.

282
00:09:27,170 --> 00:09:29,109
(He received a lot of celebratory messages with his announcement.)

283
00:09:29,109 --> 00:09:30,440
- Haha. - This is working fine.

284
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:33,109
Congratulations on your third pregnancy.

285
00:09:33,109 --> 00:09:34,249
(Congratulations, Haha and Byul.)

286
00:09:34,249 --> 00:09:36,450
- We ought to celebrate this. - At last,

287
00:09:36,550 --> 00:09:38,780
- Seriously. - he's a father of many children.

288
00:09:38,950 --> 00:09:41,349
- To be honest, the third baby... - I agree.

289
00:09:41,349 --> 00:09:43,320
- is such a blessing. - That's right.

290
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:44,489
- It goes for first babies too. - Right.

291
00:09:44,520 --> 00:09:47,020
- I see many couples... - Right.

292
00:09:47,020 --> 00:09:48,190
with two kids around me.

293
00:09:48,190 --> 00:09:49,530
Having three children or more...

294
00:09:50,229 --> 00:09:52,160
- I'm really jealous. - That's so cool.

295
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:54,129
- He's so cool. - After finding out about the baby,

296
00:09:54,129 --> 00:09:55,729
you were sorry to your wife.

297
00:09:56,430 --> 00:09:57,599
Yes.

298
00:09:57,599 --> 00:10:00,369
I made a promise to my wife.

299
00:10:00,369 --> 00:10:02,739
I told her that she should be...

300
00:10:02,839 --> 00:10:05,040
- where she belongs now. - That's right.

301
00:10:05,109 --> 00:10:06,310
- I told her to sing again. - Byul...

302
00:10:06,310 --> 00:10:08,209
(He wanted his wife to become a singer again.)

303
00:10:08,280 --> 00:10:10,079
Actually, she belongs to the stage.

304
00:10:10,079 --> 00:10:11,550
- That's right. - Including myself, the fans...

305
00:10:11,550 --> 00:10:13,420
- are waiting for her to come back. - Right.

306
00:10:13,420 --> 00:10:14,489
My gosh.

307
00:10:15,190 --> 00:10:16,190
But...

308
00:10:16,190 --> 00:10:17,859
I couldn't hold it back.

309
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:21,329
(But I couldn't hold it back.)

310
00:10:21,790 --> 00:10:23,430
- What are you trying to say? - I mean...

311
00:10:23,729 --> 00:10:27,099
(Thanks to his impatience, they received a blessing.)

312
00:10:27,099 --> 00:10:29,469
- They love each other. - Pardon?

313
00:10:29,469 --> 00:10:31,469
Have you thought about a baby name for your third child?

314
00:10:31,469 --> 00:10:33,969
- The baby names became real names. - Yes, yes.

315
00:10:34,410 --> 00:10:36,270
As for our second child,

316
00:10:36,369 --> 00:10:38,280
we all thought that it'd be a girl.

317
00:10:38,280 --> 00:10:41,109
That's why we named him Soul, and we just kept it.

318
00:10:41,109 --> 00:10:43,550
- We have a good feeling about this. - What about your third child?

319
00:10:44,009 --> 00:10:46,079
- We named the baby Song for now. - Song?

320
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:47,820
S-O-N-G. Song.

321
00:10:47,820 --> 00:10:49,690
- Song? - Song?

322
00:10:49,690 --> 00:10:51,219
- Dream, Soul, and Song. - Song.

323
00:10:52,089 --> 00:10:53,259
- Ha Song. - Ha Song.

324
00:10:53,459 --> 00:10:55,129
- That's so pretty. It's perfect. - The names are great.

325
00:10:55,129 --> 00:10:58,129
- They come up with great names. - Haha is good at naming.

326
00:10:58,129 --> 00:10:59,400
He's really good.

327
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:01,670
Anyway, congratulations.

328
00:11:02,300 --> 00:11:04,239
(Let's wrap up.)

329
00:11:05,270 --> 00:11:06,300
I love you.

330
00:11:06,300 --> 00:11:07,300
(Is this it?)

331
00:11:07,300 --> 00:11:08,410
Please be healthy.

332
00:11:08,410 --> 00:11:09,640
Say something to Byul.

333
00:11:09,640 --> 00:11:13,310
(The second story is wrapped up quickly.)

334
00:11:13,839 --> 00:11:16,009
We will be happy and healthy.

335
00:11:16,009 --> 00:11:17,950
Go back to your seat.

336
00:11:17,950 --> 00:11:19,150
Go back.

337
00:11:19,150 --> 00:11:21,219
- This is hilarious. - That was enough.

338
00:11:21,219 --> 00:11:22,790
- So funny. - And then...

339
00:11:22,790 --> 00:11:25,020
The winner of two awards,

340
00:11:25,020 --> 00:11:26,759
Jong Kook.

341
00:11:26,759 --> 00:11:28,030
Congratulations.

342
00:11:29,129 --> 00:11:32,560
(Jong Kook won 2 awards for his variety shows in 2018.)

343
00:11:32,599 --> 00:11:34,800
(He accepted the awards while hosting the ceremony.)

344
00:11:35,999 --> 00:11:39,540
(It was his first Producer Award ever.)

345
00:11:39,540 --> 00:11:41,270
(Shy)

346
00:11:41,910 --> 00:11:47,440
(He finished the year as the choice of the producers.)

347
00:11:47,810 --> 00:11:48,950
First of all,

348
00:11:48,950 --> 00:11:50,579
Jong Kook...

349
00:11:50,680 --> 00:11:52,820
received so much love...

350
00:11:52,820 --> 00:11:54,989
from the viewers of "Mom's Diary" and Running Man.

351
00:11:54,989 --> 00:11:56,349
- That's right. - Please say something to them.

352
00:11:56,349 --> 00:11:57,859
Okay. The thing is,

353
00:11:57,859 --> 00:12:00,589
I didn't give a good acceptance speech.

354
00:12:00,589 --> 00:12:03,229
It looks like you have a title match coming up.

355
00:12:03,359 --> 00:12:05,400
(He looks like an MMA fighter.)

356
00:12:05,400 --> 00:12:06,859
Right.

357
00:12:07,030 --> 00:12:08,629
UFC.

358
00:12:08,629 --> 00:12:09,969
Do you have a title match?

359
00:12:09,969 --> 00:12:12,070
Jong Kook will win!

360
00:12:12,839 --> 00:12:14,040
(He will beat everyone.)

361
00:12:14,040 --> 00:12:15,170
K-1.

362
00:12:15,369 --> 00:12:18,780
Jong Kook always says...

363
00:12:18,780 --> 00:12:21,079
it's not that he is not interested in getting married.

364
00:12:21,079 --> 00:12:22,579
- He is. - Right.

365
00:12:22,579 --> 00:12:23,810
- It's driving me crazy. - He always says that.

366
00:12:23,810 --> 00:12:26,180
- Especially these days. - Let me ask you.

367
00:12:26,219 --> 00:12:29,520
Are you interested in getting married this year?

368
00:12:29,619 --> 00:12:31,959
I'm not sure if I can get married this year.

369
00:12:31,959 --> 00:12:33,820
- You should start dating first. - I want to start dating.

370
00:12:33,820 --> 00:12:35,430
- You want to meet someone. - You can get married later,

371
00:12:35,430 --> 00:12:37,190
- but you should start dating. - I really want to...

372
00:12:37,190 --> 00:12:38,599
meet someone this year.

373
00:12:39,160 --> 00:12:40,729
Hopefully, I'll get married next year.

374
00:12:40,729 --> 00:12:42,599
- Next year? - 2020?

375
00:12:42,599 --> 00:12:44,839
Do you want to go on blind dates?

376
00:12:44,839 --> 00:12:46,999
That would be a bit awkward.

377
00:12:46,999 --> 00:12:48,140
You just want to meet someone.

378
00:12:48,140 --> 00:12:50,109
- I want to meet someone by chance. - By chance.

379
00:12:50,109 --> 00:12:51,339
You want to meet someone by chance.

380
00:12:51,339 --> 00:12:52,780
Yes, I prefer that.

381
00:12:52,780 --> 00:12:54,109
Here is someone too.

382
00:12:55,310 --> 00:12:58,050
(I'm here.)

383
00:12:59,420 --> 00:13:00,450
(What?)

384
00:13:00,450 --> 00:13:01,950
- Should we switch seats? - Hold on.

385
00:13:01,950 --> 00:13:03,150
Should we switch seats?

386
00:13:03,150 --> 00:13:05,290
They met by chance.

387
00:13:05,290 --> 00:13:06,719
It doesn't feel natural.

388
00:13:06,719 --> 00:13:08,229
- It does. - No, it doesn't.

389
00:13:08,229 --> 00:13:09,790
- It does. - No.

390
00:13:09,790 --> 00:13:11,129
It does feel natural.

391
00:13:11,129 --> 00:13:12,629
- It couldn't feel more natural. - But...

392
00:13:12,629 --> 00:13:13,859
- it really feels natural. - It doesn't.

393
00:13:13,859 --> 00:13:16,200
Anyway, Jong Kook,

394
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:19,040
- we hope you'll meet someone... - I'll try.

395
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:20,670
and fall in love this year.

396
00:13:20,670 --> 00:13:21,869
(We hope your wishes come true.)

397
00:13:22,170 --> 00:13:23,410
(I hope you meet someone nice.)

398
00:13:23,410 --> 00:13:25,310
- Meet someone by chance. - Please meet someone.

399
00:13:25,310 --> 00:13:26,640
- Next up is... - Next...

400
00:13:26,640 --> 00:13:28,109
So Min.

401
00:13:28,109 --> 00:13:29,310
Let's hear from her.

402
00:13:29,310 --> 00:13:32,020
- So Min. - So Min.

403
00:13:32,219 --> 00:13:35,520
When she accepted the Top Excellence Award...

404
00:13:35,520 --> 00:13:36,920
(So Min won the Top Excellence Award.)

405
00:13:37,320 --> 00:13:39,459
Her reaction was a bit over the top.

406
00:13:39,459 --> 00:13:41,589
Did she really have no idea...

407
00:13:41,589 --> 00:13:43,489
- or did she know? - "Can I really accept this?"

408
00:13:43,489 --> 00:13:44,629
(Did you really have no idea?)

409
00:13:46,129 --> 00:13:48,930
(So Min won the Top Excellence Award.)

410
00:13:48,930 --> 00:13:50,999
Running Man, Jeon So Min. Congratulations.

411
00:13:51,570 --> 00:13:53,640
(Me?)

412
00:13:53,739 --> 00:13:55,170
(Crying)

413
00:13:56,839 --> 00:13:59,140
(Sobbing)

414
00:13:59,940 --> 00:14:01,310
(Her tearful speech...)

415
00:14:01,310 --> 00:14:05,219
(surprised many people.)

416
00:14:05,780 --> 00:14:07,579
I was really surprised.

417
00:14:07,579 --> 00:14:09,589
I had never even imagined it.

418
00:14:09,589 --> 00:14:10,619
I see.

419
00:14:10,619 --> 00:14:14,290
I also felt I didn't deserve it...

420
00:14:14,290 --> 00:14:15,489
because...

421
00:14:15,489 --> 00:14:17,560
- You did well. - there were many others.

422
00:14:17,560 --> 00:14:21,499
It's all thanks to Running Man.

423
00:14:21,900 --> 00:14:23,400
Thank you.

424
00:14:23,400 --> 00:14:24,599
I barely managed to win the award the previous year.

425
00:14:24,599 --> 00:14:27,869
It took Seok Jin 20 years to win the Top Excellence Award.

426
00:14:27,869 --> 00:14:29,839
She could have won the Excellence Award first.

427
00:14:29,910 --> 00:14:31,410
Two days later,

428
00:14:31,410 --> 00:14:32,839
I was shooting something.

429
00:14:32,839 --> 00:14:35,249
Suddenly, I got a call from Seok Jin.

430
00:14:35,249 --> 00:14:37,249
- He rarely calls me. - Why did he call?

431
00:14:37,410 --> 00:14:40,050
I was a bit curious. When I answered, he said,

432
00:14:40,050 --> 00:14:42,619
"Congratulations on winning the award."

433
00:14:42,619 --> 00:14:44,489
- Suddenly? - I was so surprised.

434
00:14:44,489 --> 00:14:46,089
I asked, "Are you in a shoot right now?"

435
00:14:46,089 --> 00:14:47,119
That hurt my feelings.

436
00:14:47,119 --> 00:14:48,229
She asked me if I was in a shoot.

437
00:14:48,229 --> 00:14:50,489
It just wasn't like him.

438
00:14:50,489 --> 00:14:53,160
He was speaking with his TV voice.

439
00:14:53,160 --> 00:14:54,869
- His voice itself... - He used words he doesn't use.

440
00:14:55,170 --> 00:14:57,030
It's easy to tell.

441
00:14:57,030 --> 00:14:58,739
I didn't get to congratulate So Min at the ceremony,

442
00:14:58,739 --> 00:15:00,700
- That's why. - but I really wanted to.

443
00:15:00,700 --> 00:15:02,369
I didn't get a chance at the ceremony.

444
00:15:02,369 --> 00:15:03,810
We had a mission yesterday, right?

445
00:15:03,810 --> 00:15:06,180
I called Seok Jin while filming myself.

446
00:15:06,640 --> 00:15:07,780
"Hello."

447
00:15:08,209 --> 00:15:09,479
"Isn't this Seok Jin's number?"

448
00:15:10,079 --> 00:15:11,550
"Yes. What's the matter?"

449
00:15:12,020 --> 00:15:13,280
"Is something wrong?"

450
00:15:13,979 --> 00:15:15,190
"Is the camera rolling right now?"

451
00:15:15,190 --> 00:15:17,020
"Yes." "Hi, Kwang Soo."

452
00:15:17,020 --> 00:15:18,459
(His TV voice is back.)

453
00:15:18,459 --> 00:15:20,820
(His TV attitude is on.)

454
00:15:21,459 --> 00:15:22,759
"What's up?"

455
00:15:22,759 --> 00:15:23,930
(I did that?)

456
00:15:24,430 --> 00:15:25,729
(Last night, they were given individual missions.)

457
00:15:25,729 --> 00:15:26,800
Hello.

458
00:15:27,030 --> 00:15:28,170
Where are you?

459
00:15:28,469 --> 00:15:29,770
I'm home.

460
00:15:30,530 --> 00:15:32,170
Why do you sound so cold?

461
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:34,540
(Is the camera rolling right now?)

462
00:15:34,570 --> 00:15:35,570
Yes.

463
00:15:35,709 --> 00:15:36,839
Hi, Kwang Soo.

464
00:15:36,839 --> 00:15:38,379
(Hi, Kwang Soo.)

465
00:15:38,910 --> 00:15:40,879
(His TV attitude is on.)

466
00:15:41,009 --> 00:15:44,310
(He hurriedly picks up his camera.)

467
00:15:44,749 --> 00:15:47,379
Your voice changed so fast.

468
00:15:47,379 --> 00:15:48,989
- I mean... - Hey.

469
00:15:49,390 --> 00:15:51,219
I'm so surprised. Gosh.

470
00:15:51,359 --> 00:15:52,459
I'm sweating.

471
00:15:52,459 --> 00:15:54,259
(His voice changes according to the situation.)

472
00:15:55,089 --> 00:15:56,259
Seriously,

473
00:15:56,660 --> 00:15:58,530
- it gave me goosebumps. - Seok Jin is...

474
00:15:58,530 --> 00:16:00,729
- I was so surprised. - Seok Jin is...

475
00:16:01,160 --> 00:16:02,369
(Seok Jin would do that.)

476
00:16:02,369 --> 00:16:03,869
- Seriously. - He is...

477
00:16:04,129 --> 00:16:05,670
(Please make us laugh for a long time.)

478
00:16:05,670 --> 00:16:07,469
He is the worst.

479
00:16:07,910 --> 00:16:10,839
So Min, congratulations again.

480
00:16:10,839 --> 00:16:11,940
Top Excellence Award.

481
00:16:11,940 --> 00:16:14,650
("Running News" will come back at the end of the year.)

482
00:16:14,749 --> 00:16:16,450
Today's race.

483
00:16:16,879 --> 00:16:20,320
2019 Level Up Race, Part 2.

484
00:16:20,550 --> 00:16:22,690
Protect the Secrets.

485
00:16:22,690 --> 00:16:23,790
Protect the Secrets?

486
00:16:25,089 --> 00:16:26,820
Protect the secrets of your clan...

487
00:16:26,820 --> 00:16:29,859
until the end of the race,

488
00:16:29,859 --> 00:16:30,989
and you win prize money.

489
00:16:30,989 --> 00:16:33,499
Fail to protect either secret,

490
00:16:33,499 --> 00:16:34,869
and you will be penalized.

491
00:16:34,869 --> 00:16:36,400
At the end of every round,

492
00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:38,670
additional mission money will be distributed.

493
00:16:38,670 --> 00:16:41,270
With the budget, you can buy a level.

494
00:16:41,270 --> 00:16:42,709
(You can buy a level you want.)

495
00:16:42,709 --> 00:16:45,040
- So it's important to have money. - You can buy a level?

496
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:47,540
- It's important. - The more money, the better.

497
00:16:47,910 --> 00:16:49,709
- Do a good job. - Jae Seok.

498
00:16:49,709 --> 00:16:51,280
You don't want your secret to be revealed.

499
00:16:51,349 --> 00:16:54,820
Some of the secrets can really hurt you.

500
00:16:54,820 --> 00:16:56,020
- But... - So...

501
00:16:56,020 --> 00:16:57,489
I was serious. I was in a hurry.

502
00:16:57,489 --> 00:16:59,190
Let's protect the secrets.

503
00:17:00,820 --> 00:17:02,060
(Coming up)

504
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:04,660
(The disclosure war begins.)

505
00:17:04,799 --> 00:17:07,360
(Disclose or protect the secrets.)

506
00:17:07,700 --> 00:17:10,930
(The clan members fall into temptation.)

507
00:17:11,100 --> 00:17:14,809
(How will the disclosure war end?)

508
00:17:15,670 --> 00:17:16,739
(The first quest)

509
00:17:16,739 --> 00:17:18,309
- Basketball... - It's been a long time.

510
00:17:18,309 --> 00:17:20,509
Here is the first mission.

511
00:17:20,509 --> 00:17:22,910
The Last Match.

512
00:17:23,049 --> 00:17:24,110
The Last Match.

513
00:17:25,049 --> 00:17:28,620
We have special guests...

514
00:17:28,620 --> 00:17:30,690
- who will play a game with you. - What?

515
00:17:30,690 --> 00:17:31,819
- We have guests? - Is it a basketball match?

516
00:17:31,819 --> 00:17:32,860
No way.

517
00:17:32,860 --> 00:17:34,989
KBL All-Stars, please come out.

518
00:17:34,989 --> 00:17:36,029
Seriously?

519
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:37,459
- Really? - Really?

520
00:17:37,459 --> 00:17:38,600
Really?

521
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:39,830
(Really? Unbelievable!)

522
00:17:39,830 --> 00:17:40,900
They are here?

523
00:17:41,830 --> 00:17:44,430
Today, All-Stars will have...

524
00:17:44,430 --> 00:17:46,100
a special match with you.

525
00:17:46,100 --> 00:17:47,600
- Really? - They're here.

526
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:50,940
Changwon LG Sakers, Kim Jong Kyu.

527
00:17:50,940 --> 00:17:52,009
He is so tall.

528
00:17:54,680 --> 00:17:56,110
(Light steps...)

529
00:17:56,110 --> 00:17:58,180
(followed by a dunk)

530
00:17:59,850 --> 00:18:01,819
(He makes a dunk look so easy.)

531
00:18:02,289 --> 00:18:03,549
He did a dunk.

532
00:18:03,950 --> 00:18:04,959
I've never seen it in real life.

533
00:18:04,959 --> 00:18:05,959
(Kim Jong Kyu)

534
00:18:06,059 --> 00:18:08,289
Incheon Electroland Elephants,

535
00:18:08,289 --> 00:18:09,830
Park Chan Hee.

536
00:18:09,830 --> 00:18:10,860
Park Chan Hee.

537
00:18:11,860 --> 00:18:12,959
(He is handsome.)

538
00:18:12,959 --> 00:18:14,029
All-Stars.

539
00:18:14,229 --> 00:18:15,330
He is handsome.

540
00:18:18,539 --> 00:18:20,269
(Fancy feet...)

541
00:18:20,269 --> 00:18:22,440
(finished with a neat lay-up)

542
00:18:23,170 --> 00:18:24,170
(He is amazing.)

543
00:18:24,170 --> 00:18:25,739
- He is good-looking! - That was beautiful.

544
00:18:25,739 --> 00:18:28,580
(Park Chan Hee, guard of the national team)

545
00:18:28,580 --> 00:18:29,650
Nice to meet you.

546
00:18:29,650 --> 00:18:30,779
That was beautiful.

547
00:18:31,620 --> 00:18:33,880
Anyang KGC,

548
00:18:33,880 --> 00:18:35,519
Yang Hee Jong.

549
00:18:36,850 --> 00:18:38,319
He is handsome.

550
00:18:38,620 --> 00:18:40,590
- Mr. Yang! - A three-pointer.

551
00:18:40,590 --> 00:18:41,630
Will it go in?

552
00:18:41,630 --> 00:18:43,259
(He pulls off a 3-pointer.)

553
00:18:46,900 --> 00:18:47,900
(Amazed)

554
00:18:50,069 --> 00:18:53,269
(Yang Hee Jong, forward of the national team)

555
00:18:53,840 --> 00:18:55,440
Seoul Samsung Thunders,

556
00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:56,870
Lee Kwan Hee.

557
00:18:56,870 --> 00:18:57,910
(Lee Kwan Hee)

558
00:18:58,009 --> 00:18:59,880
- He looks amazing. - Another three-pointer?

559
00:19:00,009 --> 00:19:01,180
He looks amazing.

560
00:19:01,180 --> 00:19:02,809
(3-pointer)

561
00:19:05,180 --> 00:19:06,219
(The ball flew in an arc.)

562
00:19:06,219 --> 00:19:07,249
It didn't go in.

563
00:19:07,350 --> 00:19:09,019
(No goal)

564
00:19:09,019 --> 00:19:10,120
Okay!

565
00:19:10,120 --> 00:19:11,620
Lee Kwan Hee.

566
00:19:11,620 --> 00:19:13,590
(He must be nervous.)

567
00:19:13,590 --> 00:19:15,059
Okay! It's okay.

568
00:19:15,059 --> 00:19:17,259
(He tries again and succeeds.)

569
00:19:17,789 --> 00:19:18,900
He's handsome.

570
00:19:18,900 --> 00:19:20,900
(Lee Kwan Hee, Korea's 3rd-highest scorer)

571
00:19:20,900 --> 00:19:23,100
Please come to the center.

572
00:19:23,330 --> 00:19:24,400
Hello.

573
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:26,670
(He gestures to So Min.)

574
00:19:26,799 --> 00:19:29,509
(You distracted me, so I couldn't score.)

575
00:19:29,640 --> 00:19:30,640
(So Min takes notice of him too.)

576
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:32,440
So Min looks happy.

577
00:19:34,039 --> 00:19:35,249
He's so handsome.

578
00:19:35,350 --> 00:19:37,150
Busan KT Sonicboom,

579
00:19:37,150 --> 00:19:38,719
Yang Hong Seok.

580
00:19:38,719 --> 00:19:39,719
(Yang Hong Seok)

581
00:19:39,719 --> 00:19:40,719
(He is cute.)

582
00:19:40,719 --> 00:19:42,090
They're all so tall.

583
00:19:43,989 --> 00:19:44,989
A dunk.

584
00:19:44,989 --> 00:19:47,789
(After showing off his skills, he shoots the ball.)

585
00:19:47,789 --> 00:19:49,259
(No goal)

586
00:19:49,259 --> 00:19:50,289
A lay-up.

587
00:19:51,229 --> 00:19:53,830
(Following Lee Kwan Hee, Yang Hong Seok fails too.)

588
00:19:53,830 --> 00:19:55,069
It didn't go in.

589
00:19:55,069 --> 00:19:56,170
(Poor guy.)

590
00:19:56,569 --> 00:19:58,469
(I'm relieved.)

591
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:04,039
(Super rookie Yang Hong Seok)

592
00:20:05,380 --> 00:20:07,680
Yang! We have many Yangs today.

593
00:20:07,680 --> 00:20:10,509
Wonju DB Promy, Marcus Foster.

594
00:20:10,509 --> 00:20:11,650
(Marcus Foster)

595
00:20:12,420 --> 00:20:13,680
Foster.

596
00:20:14,150 --> 00:20:15,890
He looks amazing.

597
00:20:15,890 --> 00:20:17,019
(He is KBL's best 3-point shooter, but today...)

598
00:20:19,489 --> 00:20:20,620
(He flies up...)

599
00:20:20,620 --> 00:20:22,630
(and dunks the ball.)

600
00:20:23,330 --> 00:20:25,600
(Is he made of rubber or something?)

601
00:20:26,229 --> 00:20:27,299
Amazing.

602
00:20:27,299 --> 00:20:29,200
(Marcus Foster, amazing dunker and 3-point shooter)

603
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:31,940
KBL All-Stars. Let's give them a big hand.

604
00:20:31,940 --> 00:20:32,999
(Their passion heats up the winter.)

605
00:20:33,100 --> 00:20:34,170
(6 KBL All-Stars)

606
00:20:34,170 --> 00:20:36,640
This is incredible.

607
00:20:37,140 --> 00:20:39,809
Ji Hyo and So Min...

608
00:20:40,110 --> 00:20:42,509
- The two of them are... - They're in love.

609
00:20:42,509 --> 00:20:43,709
They're going crazy.

610
00:20:43,709 --> 00:20:46,180
One of the players must have stolen her heart.

611
00:20:46,180 --> 00:20:47,219
I'm sure.

612
00:20:47,450 --> 00:20:51,289
You all normally play on different teams.

613
00:20:51,289 --> 00:20:52,890
Why are you gathered together?

614
00:20:52,890 --> 00:20:56,660
There will be an All-Star Game in Changwon soon.

615
00:20:56,660 --> 00:20:58,559
As the hottest players of each team...

616
00:20:58,559 --> 00:21:00,160
(We are the hottest players.)

617
00:21:00,299 --> 00:21:01,400
We were chosen...

618
00:21:01,670 --> 00:21:03,769
- You just called yourself... - He said it himself.

619
00:21:03,769 --> 00:21:06,170
He called himself hot.

620
00:21:06,170 --> 00:21:07,469
- It's not easy. - I love it.

621
00:21:07,469 --> 00:21:09,569
You are the hottest players.

622
00:21:09,569 --> 00:21:11,269
- He is handsome. - They are hot.

623
00:21:11,269 --> 00:21:12,880
They look really amazing.

624
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:14,180
He looks like Beenzino.

625
00:21:14,180 --> 00:21:16,209
- Right. - He's handsome.

626
00:21:16,350 --> 00:21:17,549
He's attractive.

627
00:21:17,549 --> 00:21:19,519
Kwan Hee, please say something.

628
00:21:19,519 --> 00:21:23,150
I'm a fan of two of you.

629
00:21:23,150 --> 00:21:24,620
- Who? - Who?

630
00:21:24,620 --> 00:21:25,959
(Two?)

631
00:21:25,959 --> 00:21:27,190
(So Min and Ji Hyo?)

632
00:21:27,190 --> 00:21:28,529
Who are they?

633
00:21:28,830 --> 00:21:32,259
So Min and...

634
00:21:32,259 --> 00:21:33,959
(I'm sure it's me.)

635
00:21:34,029 --> 00:21:36,900
- Seok Jin. - Seok Jin?

636
00:21:36,900 --> 00:21:38,640
(Kwan Hee loves Seok Jin.)

637
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:40,569
- That's unexpected. - Why?

638
00:21:40,569 --> 00:21:42,809
- I thought it'd be Ji Hyo. - Exactly.

639
00:21:42,809 --> 00:21:43,910
I thought it'd be those two.

640
00:21:43,910 --> 00:21:44,979
- Ji Hyo... - I mean...

641
00:21:44,979 --> 00:21:47,440
I don't like that I was chosen along with Seok Jin.

642
00:21:47,479 --> 00:21:48,779
Be quiet.

643
00:21:48,779 --> 00:21:51,080
Why... I understand So Min,

644
00:21:51,080 --> 00:21:52,779
- but why Seok Jin? - His taste...

645
00:21:52,779 --> 00:21:55,620
He is the perfect example of...

646
00:21:55,620 --> 00:21:59,059
"The one who survives is the strongest."

647
00:21:59,059 --> 00:22:00,959
He exemplifies it.

648
00:22:00,959 --> 00:22:03,830
I don't really like people like Jae Seok.

649
00:22:03,830 --> 00:22:04,999
- Why? - Why?

650
00:22:04,999 --> 00:22:08,769
It'd be too hard to live like him.

651
00:22:08,769 --> 00:22:10,969
- It's not easy. - He's realistic.

652
00:22:10,969 --> 00:22:13,370
It's not easy to live as Yu Jae Seok.

653
00:22:13,370 --> 00:22:16,469
The one who survives longest is the strongest.

654
00:22:17,209 --> 00:22:18,940
Why do you like So Min?

655
00:22:18,940 --> 00:22:22,110
- She is so cheerful. - Cheerful.

656
00:22:22,209 --> 00:22:23,610
She's tucking her hair behind her ears.

657
00:22:23,610 --> 00:22:26,819
So Min is looking for someone to date.

658
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:28,549
- It's true. - It's true.

659
00:22:28,549 --> 00:22:30,249
- They look cute together. - They look cute together.

660
00:22:30,249 --> 00:22:32,019
- Stand next to him. - Stand next to him.

661
00:22:32,259 --> 00:22:33,519
- Stand next to him. - They look cute together.

662
00:22:33,519 --> 00:22:34,860
(Pretending to be shy, she stands next to him.)

663
00:22:35,830 --> 00:22:37,930
She is our playgirl.

664
00:22:37,930 --> 00:22:40,229
- Playgirl. - Okay.

665
00:22:40,259 --> 00:22:42,499
She is blushing.

666
00:22:43,430 --> 00:22:45,969
Go back to your position now.

667
00:22:45,969 --> 00:22:47,640
Good luck, So Min.

668
00:22:47,640 --> 00:22:50,840
Foster was voted as an All-Star by fans.

669
00:22:50,840 --> 00:22:52,479
How does he feel?

670
00:22:52,479 --> 00:22:54,110
Jae Seok is not good at English.

671
00:22:54,110 --> 00:22:56,410
- I'm not good. - In this global age.

672
00:22:56,410 --> 00:22:58,549
I'd love to be able to talk to him.

673
00:22:58,549 --> 00:22:59,979
Korean, no?

674
00:22:59,979 --> 00:23:01,479
- No. - "Korean, no"?

675
00:23:01,749 --> 00:23:03,519
English, okay?

676
00:23:03,519 --> 00:23:05,259
- Yes, perfect. - English, okay?

677
00:23:05,259 --> 00:23:07,690
- Handsome guy. - Thank you.

678
00:23:08,630 --> 00:23:10,930
- And I said he's my role model. - You like that?

679
00:23:10,930 --> 00:23:12,100
- You like that? - I liked that.

680
00:23:12,360 --> 00:23:14,160
- You like it? - My role model.

681
00:23:14,160 --> 00:23:15,700
He likes it.

682
00:23:15,700 --> 00:23:18,170
It's not easy to say something like that.

683
00:23:18,170 --> 00:23:20,640
It's not easy to say something like that.

684
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:23,370
But Seok Jin can do it.

685
00:23:23,370 --> 00:23:27,039
The players will randomly pick a number.

686
00:23:27,039 --> 00:23:28,279
- Randomly? - Yes.

687
00:23:28,279 --> 00:23:31,719
You can shoot a ball as many times as the number you pick.

688
00:23:32,549 --> 00:23:35,350
If you pick 3, you can shoot 3 times.

689
00:23:35,350 --> 00:23:38,150
- If you pick 1, only once. - Okay.

690
00:23:38,150 --> 00:23:39,519
Pick a number.

691
00:23:39,519 --> 00:23:41,729
- 3 would be the best. - 3 would be the best.

692
00:23:41,729 --> 00:23:44,130
- I'll take the remaining one. - Hong Seok.

693
00:23:44,430 --> 00:23:46,459
- He is just like me. - That's right.

694
00:23:46,459 --> 00:23:48,700
- Kwan Hee. - I can't wait.

695
00:23:49,330 --> 00:23:51,569
Let's see Kwan Hee's number first.

696
00:23:51,569 --> 00:23:53,640
- What's the number? - Hey.

697
00:23:53,640 --> 00:23:55,769
- It's 1. - I don't need 3 chances.

698
00:23:55,769 --> 00:23:56,870
I just need one.

699
00:23:56,969 --> 00:23:58,840
Just like Seok Jin,

700
00:23:58,840 --> 00:24:00,910
- He is like me. - he is unlucky.

701
00:24:01,180 --> 00:24:03,450
(The numbers of chances have been determined.)

702
00:24:03,450 --> 00:24:05,319
The numbers of chances have been determined.

703
00:24:05,580 --> 00:24:07,150
It's time to recruit players.

704
00:24:07,549 --> 00:24:10,549
The starting bid is determined by the number of chances.

705
00:24:10,549 --> 00:24:12,989
Through a draft, recruit players.

706
00:24:12,989 --> 00:24:15,259
The players will shoot balls.

707
00:24:15,259 --> 00:24:17,559
Every time a player scores,

708
00:24:17,559 --> 00:24:19,459
his team wins 10 dollars.

709
00:24:19,860 --> 00:24:21,969
- First... - This is crazy.

710
00:24:21,969 --> 00:24:24,069
Yang Hong Seok.

711
00:24:24,269 --> 00:24:27,069
He has 3 chances. We should bid 20 dollars.

712
00:24:27,940 --> 00:24:29,940
- Do you score every time? - Yes.

713
00:24:29,940 --> 00:24:33,340
The starting bid is five dollars.

714
00:24:33,539 --> 00:24:37,080
Let's say you recruit him for five dollars...

715
00:24:37,080 --> 00:24:38,749
and he scores. Then you get 10 dollars.

716
00:24:38,749 --> 00:24:40,549
- 10 dollars. - We bid 5 dollars.

717
00:24:40,549 --> 00:24:41,549
- Good. - Five dollars.

718
00:24:41,549 --> 00:24:43,190
- Eight. - Hey.

719
00:24:43,190 --> 00:24:45,459
- Talk to me first. - Eight.

720
00:24:45,459 --> 00:24:47,090
- 10. - 10.

721
00:24:47,090 --> 00:24:49,890
Then you will break even.

722
00:24:49,890 --> 00:24:51,759
- You'll break even. - Hold on. We'll just break even.

723
00:24:51,759 --> 00:24:53,729
- 1... - 12 dollars!

724
00:24:53,729 --> 00:24:55,930
- Then we'll lose money. - 12 dollars.

725
00:24:55,930 --> 00:24:57,469
(Even if he scores, they'll lose money.)

726
00:24:57,469 --> 00:24:59,340
- 12 dollars. - We'll lose money.

727
00:24:59,340 --> 00:25:01,809
- I'm relieved. - Hold on.

728
00:25:01,809 --> 00:25:04,440
- Hold on. - They'll lose money.

729
00:25:04,739 --> 00:25:07,279
- We win only 10 dollars. - 5, 4,

730
00:25:07,279 --> 00:25:08,950
- 3, 2, - Cancel it.

731
00:25:08,950 --> 00:25:10,809
one. Ji Hyo.

732
00:25:10,910 --> 00:25:12,519
- You win. - Hold on.

733
00:25:12,519 --> 00:25:13,880
We'll lose money.

734
00:25:13,880 --> 00:25:16,190
- She wants to... - What are you doing?

735
00:25:16,190 --> 00:25:17,850
Are you interested in him or something?

736
00:25:17,850 --> 00:25:20,259
If Hong Seok scores, the team wins 10 dollars.

737
00:25:20,259 --> 00:25:21,989
But he was recruited for 12 dollars.

738
00:25:22,160 --> 00:25:25,959
Next up is Yang Hee Jong.

739
00:25:26,759 --> 00:25:29,100
- KBL's big brother. - It's a stable number.

740
00:25:29,100 --> 00:25:31,299
Hee Jong has 2 chances. The starting bid is 10 dollars.

741
00:25:31,299 --> 00:25:32,640
- Two chances. - All right.

742
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:34,870
- It's driving me crazy. - Let's start at 10 dollars.

743
00:25:35,370 --> 00:25:36,469
- 10 dollars. - 10 dollars.

744
00:25:36,469 --> 00:25:39,110
- 10 dollars. - 13.

745
00:25:39,110 --> 00:25:40,979
- 19. - 19.

746
00:25:40,979 --> 00:25:44,150
If he scores twice, you get a dollar.

747
00:25:44,150 --> 00:25:45,620
It's better than nothing.

748
00:25:45,620 --> 00:25:48,420
- 5, 4, 3... - What is this?

749
00:25:48,549 --> 00:25:50,390
- 2... - 19? Gosh.

750
00:25:50,450 --> 00:25:51,920
- 20. - Okay!

751
00:25:52,259 --> 00:25:54,190
- 5... - 22!

752
00:25:54,190 --> 00:25:56,059
- Hey. - 22 dollars.

753
00:25:56,059 --> 00:25:57,789
- It's my last offer. - four,

754
00:25:57,930 --> 00:26:01,630
3, 2, 1. Okay.

755
00:26:01,630 --> 00:26:03,799
Why do we want to lose money?

756
00:26:04,830 --> 00:26:06,799
Next up is Lee Kwan Hee.

757
00:26:07,640 --> 00:26:09,069
Kwan Hee.

758
00:26:09,069 --> 00:26:12,009
Let's start. The bidding starts.

759
00:26:12,779 --> 00:26:14,080
- 5 dollars. - 5,

760
00:26:14,080 --> 00:26:16,180
- 4... - 7 dollars.

761
00:26:16,180 --> 00:26:17,910
- 9. - 9.

762
00:26:17,910 --> 00:26:19,580
- 5... - 15.

763
00:26:19,920 --> 00:26:21,219
15?

764
00:26:21,319 --> 00:26:22,890
(Love?)

765
00:26:22,890 --> 00:26:25,789
(Let me buy it for 15 dollars.)

766
00:26:26,719 --> 00:26:28,090
- 5, 4... - It's personal, isn't it?

767
00:26:28,090 --> 00:26:30,229
- 3, 2, 1. - It's getting personal.

768
00:26:30,430 --> 00:26:32,660
- 15 dollars? - Okay. 15 dollars.

769
00:26:32,660 --> 00:26:33,660
Okay!

770
00:26:33,999 --> 00:26:35,870
- Why did I say 15 dollars? - It was...

771
00:26:35,870 --> 00:26:37,229
- I could have said 10 dollars. - too obvious.

772
00:26:37,430 --> 00:26:39,440
- You'll lose five dollars. - What is this?

773
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:41,769
Why are we even doing this?

774
00:26:42,370 --> 00:26:43,840
He will succeed.

775
00:26:44,069 --> 00:26:45,069
I believe he'll score.

776
00:26:45,069 --> 00:26:47,880
- Next up is Park Chan Hee. - Good.

777
00:26:47,880 --> 00:26:49,610
- All right. - 11 dollars.

778
00:26:49,610 --> 00:26:51,450
11 dollars. We have to.

779
00:26:51,680 --> 00:26:53,450
- We have to. - 5, 4, 3...

780
00:26:53,450 --> 00:26:55,150
- 15. - 15.

781
00:26:55,150 --> 00:26:56,150
- 5... - 17.

782
00:26:56,150 --> 00:26:58,150
17. 5, 4... Let's speed things up.

783
00:26:58,150 --> 00:27:00,420
3, 2, 1.

784
00:27:00,420 --> 00:27:01,759
- 17 dollars. - Okay.

785
00:27:02,559 --> 00:27:05,729
We'll make money for the first time.

786
00:27:05,729 --> 00:27:07,930
- Next up is Foster. - Foster.

787
00:27:07,930 --> 00:27:10,069
- Hey! Come on! - Come on!

788
00:27:10,069 --> 00:27:11,799
- Come on! - Foster.

789
00:27:11,999 --> 00:27:14,340
Can you please show us a dunk?

790
00:27:14,499 --> 00:27:15,940
- Dunk, please. - Dunk?

791
00:27:15,940 --> 00:27:17,809
- Yes. - Dunk.

792
00:27:17,809 --> 00:27:19,080
Here we go.

793
00:27:24,249 --> 00:27:25,420
(This is...)

794
00:27:25,420 --> 00:27:27,819
(how you dunk a ball.)

795
00:27:28,549 --> 00:27:31,620
(Textbook dunk)

796
00:27:32,860 --> 00:27:34,620
(His price rises.)

797
00:27:34,620 --> 00:27:36,860
Foster. Let's start.

798
00:27:37,459 --> 00:27:39,430
He has three chances.

799
00:27:40,360 --> 00:27:41,900
- Start. - 20.

800
00:27:41,900 --> 00:27:44,769
- 25. - Let's slow down a bit.

801
00:27:44,769 --> 00:27:46,999
- 27. - 30.

802
00:27:47,170 --> 00:27:49,509
- 30. - 31.

803
00:27:49,539 --> 00:27:52,880
- 31. - 5, 4, 3,

804
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:55,350
2, 1. Foster.

805
00:27:55,479 --> 00:27:58,049
- Okay. - Okay.

806
00:27:58,049 --> 00:28:00,249
They will lose so much money.

807
00:28:00,249 --> 00:28:02,920
What is this?

808
00:28:02,920 --> 00:28:05,190
If Kwan Hee fails, you will go bankrupt.

809
00:28:05,190 --> 00:28:06,860
- They will lose money. - Right?

810
00:28:06,860 --> 00:28:09,160
Lastly, Kim Jong Kyu. Let's start right away.

811
00:28:09,630 --> 00:28:10,789
16.

812
00:28:11,059 --> 00:28:12,630
- 17. - 18.

813
00:28:12,630 --> 00:28:14,130
- 19. - 20.

814
00:28:14,459 --> 00:28:16,170
- 30. - Stop it!

815
00:28:16,170 --> 00:28:17,900
- 30. - 31.

816
00:28:17,900 --> 00:28:19,569
- 31. - 32.

817
00:28:19,569 --> 00:28:21,440
- 33. - Seriously?

818
00:28:21,769 --> 00:28:23,539
- Why does everyone want to lose? - 5, 4,

819
00:28:23,539 --> 00:28:25,809
3, 2,

820
00:28:26,279 --> 00:28:28,209
1. No 35?

821
00:28:28,380 --> 00:28:30,450
All right. He comes to our team.

822
00:28:30,610 --> 00:28:32,779
(The recruitment is finished.)

823
00:28:34,950 --> 00:28:37,519
- We have to succeed every time. - We have the best one.

824
00:28:37,519 --> 00:28:40,090
All success.

825
00:28:40,819 --> 00:28:42,259
The quest begins.

826
00:28:42,259 --> 00:28:44,759
Avoid white hoops and win the mission money.

827
00:28:44,759 --> 00:28:48,029
You can only shoot the balls you chose.

828
00:28:48,029 --> 00:28:51,229
Also, as long as you stay inside the lines,

829
00:28:51,529 --> 00:28:53,539
you can shoot any way you want.

830
00:28:53,539 --> 00:28:55,709
- You can run up if you want. - It doesn't matter?

831
00:28:55,709 --> 00:28:57,709
- You can also shoot where you are. - Okay.

832
00:28:57,840 --> 00:29:01,009
Let's start from the clans with two players.

833
00:29:01,209 --> 00:29:03,850
- Okay! - Park Chan Hee.

834
00:29:03,880 --> 00:29:05,620
Park Chan Hee!

835
00:29:05,850 --> 00:29:08,719
- Chan Hee! - Let's go, Chan Hee!

836
00:29:10,090 --> 00:29:11,989
(1st try out of 2)

837
00:29:13,920 --> 00:29:16,559
Please. The white hoops.

838
00:29:17,989 --> 00:29:19,830
(Can he avoid the white hoops...)

839
00:29:19,830 --> 00:29:23,569
(and win his team 10 dollars?)

840
00:29:26,469 --> 00:29:27,900
Yes!

841
00:29:28,539 --> 00:29:30,469
(It didn't go into the white hoops.)

842
00:29:30,469 --> 00:29:32,180
(He is so exhilarated that his veins stick out.)

843
00:29:33,779 --> 00:29:35,749
- I'm so relieved. - He's so happy.

844
00:29:35,749 --> 00:29:37,880
He's so happy. Okay.

845
00:29:38,150 --> 00:29:39,620
You have one more chance.

846
00:29:39,620 --> 00:29:40,650
One more.

847
00:29:40,650 --> 00:29:41,850
Basketballs are easy to score with.

848
00:29:41,850 --> 00:29:43,150
Go into the white hoops.

849
00:29:43,150 --> 00:29:44,850
- All right. Park Chan Hee! - Fail!

850
00:29:44,850 --> 00:29:46,690
That would be funny.

851
00:29:46,690 --> 00:29:47,989
Okay!

852
00:29:47,989 --> 00:29:49,330
(Goal)

853
00:29:49,330 --> 00:29:50,860
Okay!

854
00:29:51,930 --> 00:29:53,330
Park Chan Hee.

855
00:29:53,330 --> 00:29:54,930
(This is the guard of the national team.)

856
00:29:56,930 --> 00:29:58,269
(He was recruited for 17 dollars.)

857
00:29:58,269 --> 00:30:00,769
We win 20 dollars.

858
00:30:01,370 --> 00:30:03,469
- 20 dollars. Next. - I'm looking forward to it.

859
00:30:03,469 --> 00:30:05,009
- Kim Jong Kyu. - Let's go!

860
00:30:05,009 --> 00:30:06,140
- You can do this! - White hoops!

861
00:30:06,209 --> 00:30:08,309
- Okay! - Please.

862
00:30:09,150 --> 00:30:11,009
Please. Kim Jong Kyu!

863
00:30:11,410 --> 00:30:13,219
Red hoops.

864
00:30:14,080 --> 00:30:15,989
(The ball bounces off a red hoop.)

865
00:30:15,989 --> 00:30:17,390
- Okay. - Okay.

866
00:30:17,789 --> 00:30:19,719
(I aimed at it.)

867
00:30:20,390 --> 00:30:21,789
(No goal)

868
00:30:22,830 --> 00:30:23,830
It's okay.

869
00:30:23,830 --> 00:30:26,759
- White! - White!

870
00:30:26,759 --> 00:30:28,559
- Bounce. - White.

871
00:30:28,630 --> 00:30:31,569
Bounce into a white hoop.

872
00:30:31,569 --> 00:30:33,739
(I never fail twice.)

873
00:30:34,940 --> 00:30:36,910
(His second attempt was a success.)

874
00:30:36,910 --> 00:30:38,170
He shoots where he aims.

875
00:30:38,170 --> 00:30:39,440
You never know.

876
00:30:39,440 --> 00:30:41,080
Let's go!

877
00:30:41,080 --> 00:30:42,950
Let's go, Changwon!

878
00:30:44,910 --> 00:30:47,080
(He scores twice in a row.)

879
00:30:47,080 --> 00:30:49,519
- Amazing. - Good job.

880
00:30:49,519 --> 00:30:51,019
- That was close. - Okay.

881
00:30:51,190 --> 00:30:54,259
Let's move on to the team with rubber gloves.

882
00:30:54,259 --> 00:30:56,890
It'd be a miracle to score by shooting rubber gloves.

883
00:30:56,890 --> 00:30:59,100
We'll do it the Michael Jordan way.

884
00:30:59,400 --> 00:31:00,999
See if he steps over the line.

885
00:31:00,999 --> 00:31:02,499
- It's okay. - If he does, he's out.

886
00:31:02,499 --> 00:31:04,299
(Without any practice,)

887
00:31:04,299 --> 00:31:06,440
(will he turn his one chance into a miracle?)

888
00:31:08,840 --> 00:31:11,069
(No way, the ball went in.)

889
00:31:13,880 --> 00:31:15,009
My goodness.

890
00:31:15,580 --> 00:31:17,450
Hurry and hit my shoulder.

891
00:31:17,450 --> 00:31:18,920
(Is it an expression of love?)

892
00:31:18,920 --> 00:31:20,680
(He meets So Min's expectation and scores.)

893
00:31:21,150 --> 00:31:22,289
That was amazing.

894
00:31:22,289 --> 00:31:24,690
(Even his role model Seok Jin approves.)

895
00:31:24,890 --> 00:31:27,360
(He makes it in one go.)

896
00:31:27,360 --> 00:31:29,090
- That was great. - Next is...

897
00:31:29,190 --> 00:31:30,289
Foster.

898
00:31:30,289 --> 00:31:31,590
(The second player is Foster.)

899
00:31:31,590 --> 00:31:32,799
- You can do it. - It's okay.

900
00:31:32,799 --> 00:31:35,299
- He was the most popular. - It's okay.

901
00:31:35,670 --> 00:31:36,729
Will it be a dunk?

902
00:31:37,469 --> 00:31:38,499
What's going on?

903
00:31:40,269 --> 00:31:43,509
(The ball reaches the hoop.)

904
00:31:43,509 --> 00:31:45,110
(It goes in between...)

905
00:31:45,110 --> 00:31:46,809
(a white and a red hoop.)

906
00:31:47,910 --> 00:31:50,309
(Will it go in a white hoop?)

907
00:31:51,850 --> 00:31:52,979
He made it.

908
00:31:52,979 --> 00:31:54,620
(It barely goes into a red hoop.)

909
00:31:54,620 --> 00:31:56,120
- It went in. - It did.

910
00:31:56,120 --> 00:31:57,850
It went in.

911
00:31:57,850 --> 00:31:59,789
(No way.)

912
00:31:59,789 --> 00:32:01,259
It's unbelievable.

913
00:32:01,259 --> 00:32:03,029
- Goodness. - It's unbelievable.

914
00:32:03,390 --> 00:32:04,729
- Two more. - You can do it.

915
00:32:04,789 --> 00:32:05,860
How is this possible?

916
00:32:09,029 --> 00:32:10,200
Is it the white one?

917
00:32:10,200 --> 00:32:12,269
(He aims the same hoop and makes it.)

918
00:32:12,870 --> 00:32:14,870
(What's going on?)

919
00:32:15,910 --> 00:32:17,269
This is unbelievable.

920
00:32:17,640 --> 00:32:19,479
- One more. - Do it one more time.

921
00:32:19,479 --> 00:32:20,680
(He's worth selecting after all.)

922
00:32:20,739 --> 00:32:23,080
- He made it to the same hoop. - He looks so innocent.

923
00:32:23,080 --> 00:32:25,479
- It's interesting. - He's better at it than basketball.

924
00:32:26,120 --> 00:32:27,779
- He's better at it than basketball. - Let's see.

925
00:32:28,650 --> 00:32:32,289
(He makes it into the same hoop three times.)

926
00:32:32,289 --> 00:32:33,390
Unbelievable.

927
00:32:33,390 --> 00:32:34,489
(You're going to make us look bad now.)

928
00:32:34,489 --> 00:32:36,130
No way. How is this possible?

929
00:32:36,130 --> 00:32:37,259
This is amazing.

930
00:32:37,259 --> 00:32:39,630
Next is Yang Hee Jong.

931
00:32:39,759 --> 00:32:41,600
- Dried pollack... - Yang Hee Jong.

932
00:32:41,860 --> 00:32:43,670
- Yang Hee Jong. - Please.

933
00:32:43,670 --> 00:32:46,969
Seriously, he's a KBL All-Star.

934
00:32:46,969 --> 00:32:49,039
- Dried pollack is too harsh. - I'm sorry, sir.

935
00:32:49,039 --> 00:32:51,140
Isn't it harsh?

936
00:32:51,140 --> 00:32:52,580
- You can do it. - You can do it.

937
00:32:52,580 --> 00:32:53,580
Let's go, Hee Jong.

938
00:32:53,640 --> 00:32:54,779
You're our team's hope.

939
00:32:54,779 --> 00:32:56,309
(Dried pollack)

940
00:32:56,309 --> 00:33:00,350
(Fly and go into a red hoop.)

941
00:33:00,350 --> 00:33:02,180
(Tap)

942
00:33:02,350 --> 00:33:03,519
Oh, this is bad.

943
00:33:03,519 --> 00:33:04,620
- Okay. - It's out.

944
00:33:04,620 --> 00:33:07,719
(He fails his first dried pollack shoot.)

945
00:33:08,319 --> 00:33:11,330
(He's never felt sorry by not making a pollack into the goal.)

946
00:33:11,330 --> 00:33:12,459
Couldn't you run and throw?

947
00:33:12,459 --> 00:33:13,660
(Don't stand still.)

948
00:33:13,660 --> 00:33:14,729
Stay back.

949
00:33:14,729 --> 00:33:16,529
Why are you complaining?

950
00:33:16,529 --> 00:33:17,600
Can't you jump?

951
00:33:17,600 --> 00:33:18,900
- Give me some time. - White.

952
00:33:18,900 --> 00:33:21,569
- White, white. - White, white.

953
00:33:21,569 --> 00:33:23,110
It'll be amazing if he makes it into a white one.

954
00:33:23,110 --> 00:33:24,739
- It will be incredible. - White hoop.

955
00:33:24,739 --> 00:33:26,809
- Hee Jong. - White hoop.

956
00:33:26,809 --> 00:33:29,380
(His reputation as a national team basketball player is at stake.)

957
00:33:30,979 --> 00:33:33,819
(He will recover his honor with a great shot.)

958
00:33:35,350 --> 00:33:38,249
(It definitely goes into a white hoop.)

959
00:33:38,249 --> 00:33:40,590
(He loses 10 dollars.)

960
00:33:41,190 --> 00:33:44,229
(He wants to run away.)

961
00:33:44,590 --> 00:33:47,759
(Can we get a refund on this guy?)

962
00:33:48,200 --> 00:33:50,330
(They're stupefied.)

963
00:33:50,330 --> 00:33:51,670
- Okay. - That's amazing.

964
00:33:52,799 --> 00:33:53,870
Goodness.

965
00:33:53,870 --> 00:33:55,400
(His pride is shattered.)

966
00:33:55,400 --> 00:33:58,039
That's what happens when anyone joins our team.

967
00:33:58,039 --> 00:33:59,180
Come on.

968
00:33:59,180 --> 00:34:01,180
- It's so strange. - Isn't he a living legend?

969
00:34:01,279 --> 00:34:02,309
Seriously.

970
00:34:02,309 --> 00:34:04,150
- He is a legend. - Then what happened?

971
00:34:04,150 --> 00:34:05,410
(Seok Jin and Kwang Soo lose 22 and 10 dollars.)

972
00:34:05,410 --> 00:34:06,519
Let's start again.

973
00:34:06,979 --> 00:34:09,649
- Hong Seok. - Unfortunately, they get one shot.

974
00:34:09,649 --> 00:34:11,189
Bounce, bounce, bounce, white hoop.

975
00:34:11,189 --> 00:34:12,189
(Please bounce and make it to a white hoop.)

976
00:34:12,719 --> 00:34:15,089
(He gets only one chance.)

977
00:34:16,529 --> 00:34:19,830
(A rookie star player throws with confidence.)

978
00:34:19,830 --> 00:34:20,960
What's going on?

979
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:22,000
(Please go in.)

980
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:26,370
(It bounces off from the hoop.)

981
00:34:29,140 --> 00:34:30,410
(Ji Hyo and Se Chan earn nothing.)

982
00:34:30,410 --> 00:34:32,739
- That's too bad. - It can't be helped.

983
00:34:32,739 --> 00:34:34,009
(Current mission budget status)

984
00:34:34,009 --> 00:34:36,149
- It's over. - It's over.

985
00:34:36,450 --> 00:34:38,250
After every round,

986
00:34:38,580 --> 00:34:40,319
you get a chance to level up.

987
00:34:40,480 --> 00:34:42,819
Originally, we were planning to give it to the one team that won.

988
00:34:42,819 --> 00:34:44,390
- Do we get one more chance? - Therefore,

989
00:34:44,890 --> 00:34:47,120
Clan Jae Seok and Clan Jong Kook...

990
00:34:47,120 --> 00:34:49,529
- will compete to decide the winner. - By one shot?

991
00:34:49,529 --> 00:34:51,989
I bet Jae Seok and Jong Kook's basketball skills are similar.

992
00:34:52,129 --> 00:34:53,600
- Start. - Start.

993
00:34:54,299 --> 00:34:56,270
(Jae Seok goes first.)

994
00:34:56,930 --> 00:34:59,939
(He throws it while hoping to raise his level.)

995
00:34:59,939 --> 00:35:00,939
(Bouncing off)

996
00:35:01,370 --> 00:35:03,270
(Unfortunately, he doesn't make it.)

997
00:35:03,270 --> 00:35:04,310
This is a sudden death match, right?

998
00:35:04,310 --> 00:35:06,310
If he doesn't make it, you get one more chance.

999
00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:08,779
Do we win if he makes it into a white hoop?

1000
00:35:08,879 --> 00:35:10,609
- Yes. - Then we will win.

1001
00:35:10,609 --> 00:35:11,779
If it goes into a white hoop, we win.

1002
00:35:11,779 --> 00:35:12,879
Don't shoot it into a white one.

1003
00:35:12,879 --> 00:35:15,549
- White, white. - Block Jong Kook.

1004
00:35:15,549 --> 00:35:17,790
(He throws it with force.)

1005
00:35:19,120 --> 00:35:20,189
White hoop.

1006
00:35:21,089 --> 00:35:23,759
(It goes in between two red hoops.)

1007
00:35:24,460 --> 00:35:25,629
White hoop.

1008
00:35:26,299 --> 00:35:30,669
(It hits the backboard and goes into a white hoop.)

1009
00:35:31,529 --> 00:35:34,200
(Unbelievable)

1010
00:35:35,569 --> 00:35:39,279
(Jae Seok and Haha place first.)

1011
00:35:39,279 --> 00:35:41,879
(The Last Match quest is over. Please check the result.)

1012
00:35:43,950 --> 00:35:47,219
(We thank the KBL All-Stars for joining us.)

1013
00:35:47,350 --> 00:35:50,419
(Jae Seok, Haha place first. Jong Kook, So Min place second.)

1014
00:35:51,020 --> 00:35:53,020
The Secret Room quest has become available.

1015
00:35:53,020 --> 00:35:54,189
- That's amazing. - What?

1016
00:35:54,419 --> 00:35:55,859
What is it this time?

1017
00:35:55,859 --> 00:35:57,290
(What's the quest this time?)

1018
00:35:58,629 --> 00:36:01,129
Jae Seok and Haha are winners of the first round.

1019
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:05,069
You must choose a secret room each.

1020
00:36:05,069 --> 00:36:06,839
(The same clan members must enter different rooms.)

1021
00:36:06,839 --> 00:36:07,870
One each?

1022
00:36:07,870 --> 00:36:10,069
I guess only one of them can level up.

1023
00:36:10,770 --> 00:36:12,140
They must choose wisely.

1024
00:36:12,239 --> 00:36:14,609
I guess only one of us can level up.

1025
00:36:15,439 --> 00:36:19,250
(What's the secret in the secret room?)

1026
00:36:19,250 --> 00:36:20,779
- See you later. - Okay.

1027
00:36:20,950 --> 00:36:22,450
(Jae Seok chooses Room A.)

1028
00:36:22,450 --> 00:36:23,450
What's this?

1029
00:36:25,989 --> 00:36:29,730
(There's a mysterious mission card in the room.)

1030
00:36:31,089 --> 00:36:32,430
This is a level-up quest.

1031
00:36:32,560 --> 00:36:34,560
Once you reveal the secret of your clan,

1032
00:36:34,600 --> 00:36:36,569
you can level up by one.

1033
00:36:36,899 --> 00:36:38,169
Will you reveal the secret?

1034
00:36:38,969 --> 00:36:40,700
You can level up by one.

1035
00:36:40,700 --> 00:36:42,399
- This is harsh. - Will you do it?

1036
00:36:42,399 --> 00:36:43,910
Is it starting already?

1037
00:36:44,310 --> 00:36:45,569
What happens when I reveal it?

1038
00:36:45,569 --> 00:36:46,640
Will he find out...

1039
00:36:47,239 --> 00:36:49,180
- about it? - He might be able to guess that.

1040
00:36:49,250 --> 00:36:52,549
Our goal is keeping the secrets hidden until the end, right?

1041
00:36:53,020 --> 00:36:54,279
- Is that how we can win? - Yes.

1042
00:36:54,750 --> 00:36:56,620
(Clan members' secrets must be kept.)

1043
00:36:56,620 --> 00:36:58,589
(That's how you win the prize.)

1044
00:36:58,589 --> 00:37:01,219
(There's also a mission given to Haha.)

1045
00:37:01,890 --> 00:37:05,089
(He's deep in thought.)

1046
00:37:05,089 --> 00:37:08,899
(Will it be the clan's victory or raising his own level?)

1047
00:37:09,299 --> 00:37:12,870
(What will Jae Seok choose?)

1048
00:37:14,169 --> 00:37:15,339
I'll keep the secret hidden.

1049
00:37:16,569 --> 00:37:21,009
(Will you reveal your clan's secret?)

1050
00:37:21,839 --> 00:37:24,350
Even if I do decide to betray him, it has to be bigger than this.

1051
00:37:24,350 --> 00:37:25,450
We just got started.

1052
00:37:25,450 --> 00:37:26,879
(He decides to keep the secret.)

1053
00:37:26,879 --> 00:37:28,250
(He looks at the bigger picture.)

1054
00:37:28,250 --> 00:37:29,620
All right, may I go out?

1055
00:37:29,850 --> 00:37:35,620
(Jae Seok's level remains as 1.)

1056
00:37:36,589 --> 00:37:38,660
(They meet after making a choice.)

1057
00:37:38,660 --> 00:37:40,129
- You didn't, did you? - I knew it.

1058
00:37:40,129 --> 00:37:41,730
Of course not.

1059
00:37:42,200 --> 00:37:43,399
- Are you wearing the badge? - Yes.

1060
00:37:43,399 --> 00:37:44,500
(Are you wearing the badge?)

1061
00:37:45,069 --> 00:37:47,799
(Did you reveal the secret and raise your level?)

1062
00:37:47,799 --> 00:37:48,870
Do you want to die?

1063
00:37:48,870 --> 00:37:50,370
- What do you mean? - Did you reveal it?

1064
00:37:50,370 --> 00:37:51,609
Wait.

1065
00:37:51,669 --> 00:37:55,640
(He checks the level badge.)

1066
00:37:56,009 --> 00:37:57,080
What's wrong?

1067
00:37:58,279 --> 00:37:59,350
What?

1068
00:37:59,480 --> 00:38:04,520
(After coming out of the secret room, his level went up.)

1069
00:38:04,520 --> 00:38:05,689
Mister.

1070
00:38:05,750 --> 00:38:07,359
- What? - Did you reveal it?

1071
00:38:07,359 --> 00:38:08,560
I didn't reveal it.

1072
00:38:08,560 --> 00:38:09,930
You should look at the bigger picture.

1073
00:38:09,930 --> 00:38:12,359
Mine was different from yours.

1074
00:38:12,359 --> 00:38:15,060
They told me to eat honey rice cakes.

1075
00:38:15,759 --> 00:38:17,700
- Wouldn't you have done the same? - I get how it is.

1076
00:38:17,770 --> 00:38:19,799
- Fine, I got it. - Honey rice cakes.

1077
00:38:19,969 --> 00:38:21,799
- How could you reveal it? - I'd eat any day.

1078
00:38:21,969 --> 00:38:23,710
- They're back. - They are here.

1079
00:38:23,710 --> 00:38:25,469
Haha looks happy.

1080
00:38:25,609 --> 00:38:27,040
Jae Seok doesn't.

1081
00:38:27,910 --> 00:38:28,910
What's wrong?

1082
00:38:29,040 --> 00:38:30,250
What's the matter?

1083
00:38:30,310 --> 00:38:32,049
"Will you reveal the secret or not?"

1084
00:38:33,149 --> 00:38:34,620
He revealed it, didn't he?

1085
00:38:34,620 --> 00:38:35,890
I didn't.

1086
00:38:35,890 --> 00:38:37,549
- No, I didn't. - Hey.

1087
00:38:37,549 --> 00:38:39,560
I had honey rice cakes.

1088
00:38:39,560 --> 00:38:40,890
- Hey, forget it. - I had...

1089
00:38:40,919 --> 00:38:42,319
- honey rice cakes. - Forget it.

1090
00:38:42,319 --> 00:38:44,060
- I didn't reveal anything. - Stop it.

1091
00:38:44,129 --> 00:38:45,290
What did I reveal?

1092
00:38:45,290 --> 00:38:46,600
- This is unfair. - Goodness.

1093
00:38:46,600 --> 00:38:48,600
- Watch it later on TV. - Stop it.

1094
00:38:48,759 --> 00:38:50,730
- Make sure to watch it. - Stop it.

1095
00:38:50,730 --> 00:38:52,370
- I swear. - Stop it.

1096
00:38:52,569 --> 00:38:54,169
- I really didn't. - Haha.

1097
00:38:54,169 --> 00:38:55,500
You'll find out when you watch it.

1098
00:38:55,569 --> 00:38:57,040
You'll find out when you do.

1099
00:38:57,040 --> 00:38:59,879
(You will advance to the next mission.)

1100
00:39:00,310 --> 00:39:01,310
(Location of the next quest)

1101
00:39:01,310 --> 00:39:03,310
I think there are secret rooms.

1102
00:39:04,549 --> 00:39:07,279
(A quest has been discovered.)

1103
00:39:07,279 --> 00:39:08,549
For this round,

1104
00:39:08,850 --> 00:39:12,890
4 clans will pick 1 guest each.

1105
00:39:12,890 --> 00:39:15,660
A guest will join each clan.

1106
00:39:15,660 --> 00:39:17,560
- Really? - They'll help you level up.

1107
00:39:17,560 --> 00:39:19,700
Here are the four guests.

1108
00:39:20,230 --> 00:39:21,330
Who are they?

1109
00:39:21,330 --> 00:39:22,700
(You could level up depending on who you recruit.)

1110
00:39:22,700 --> 00:39:26,870
(Who are the guests for this quest?)

1111
00:39:27,200 --> 00:39:29,310
- It's Seung Yoon. - Seung Yoon is here.

1112
00:39:29,310 --> 00:39:31,210
(Kang Seung Yoon with million reasons for his popularity)

1113
00:39:31,710 --> 00:39:33,040
Have you been well?

1114
00:39:33,140 --> 00:39:34,839
- How are you? - Millions.

1115
00:39:35,279 --> 00:39:37,180
(Lee Seung Hoon with million reasons for his popularity)

1116
00:39:37,509 --> 00:39:39,819
(Whenever they release an album, they top the music charts.)

1117
00:39:39,819 --> 00:39:42,120
(They are sweeping the charts with "Millions".)

1118
00:39:42,120 --> 00:39:44,350
(Seung Yoon and Seung Hoon of Winner)

1119
00:39:44,350 --> 00:39:45,750
- Come on. - Hello.

1120
00:39:45,890 --> 00:39:47,319
It's been a long time.

1121
00:39:47,319 --> 00:39:48,560
Have you been well?

1122
00:39:48,560 --> 00:39:51,089
(It's Seung Yoon's return, but it's Seung Hoon's first time.)

1123
00:39:51,089 --> 00:39:53,560
- Have you been well? - Hello.

1124
00:39:53,560 --> 00:39:55,000
Today is great.

1125
00:39:55,060 --> 00:39:57,430
- We are all guys, so... - Don't worry.

1126
00:39:57,430 --> 00:39:58,469
I thought you wouldn't like it.

1127
00:39:58,469 --> 00:40:01,839
(Not all guests have arrived.)

1128
00:40:01,839 --> 00:40:05,210
(Who are the other guests?)

1129
00:40:05,210 --> 00:40:07,009
We are all guys, so...

1130
00:40:07,009 --> 00:40:08,109
It's Chungha.

1131
00:40:08,109 --> 00:40:09,410
(Chungha)

1132
00:40:09,410 --> 00:40:11,580
Turn it around, 12 o'clock

1133
00:40:13,350 --> 00:40:16,290
(Kim Do Yeon, the face of Weki Meki)

1134
00:40:16,649 --> 00:40:19,660
(They worked together for a year as I.O.I.)

1135
00:40:19,660 --> 00:40:22,089
(Chungha became a solo artist, and Do Yeon joined Weki Meki.)

1136
00:40:22,089 --> 00:40:24,259
(They are doing well individually.)

1137
00:40:24,259 --> 00:40:26,100
- Come this way. - Hello.

1138
00:40:26,100 --> 00:40:27,799
- Hello. - Hello.

1139
00:40:27,799 --> 00:40:29,060
Hello.

1140
00:40:29,060 --> 00:40:30,330
(It's nice to meet you.)

1141
00:40:30,469 --> 00:40:32,839
Some are popular, and some are getting popular.

1142
00:40:32,899 --> 00:40:34,640
We invited these four as our guests.

1143
00:40:34,640 --> 00:40:36,770
(Seung Hoon, Seung Yoon, Chungha, and Do Yeon)

1144
00:40:36,839 --> 00:40:41,009
I heard Do Yeon wanted to be on Running Man.

1145
00:40:41,009 --> 00:40:44,680
I wanted to ever since I was part of I.O.I.

1146
00:40:44,980 --> 00:40:46,250
I wanted to,

1147
00:40:46,250 --> 00:40:47,850
but I couldn't.

1148
00:40:47,850 --> 00:40:49,589
If you had come then,

1149
00:40:49,589 --> 00:40:51,890
Kwang Soo would have welcomed you with so much warmth.

1150
00:40:51,890 --> 00:40:52,960
I know.

1151
00:40:53,189 --> 00:40:54,359
- Oh, right. - I still welcome her.

1152
00:40:54,419 --> 00:40:55,520
I still do.

1153
00:40:55,919 --> 00:40:57,089
(I felt welcomed.)

1154
00:40:57,089 --> 00:40:59,629
In the past, Kwang Soo would make acrostic poems...

1155
00:40:59,629 --> 00:41:02,259
with Do Yeon or Chungha's name.

1156
00:41:02,259 --> 00:41:05,000
Things are different now. It's unfortunate.

1157
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:07,399
Why don't you make a poem with Chungha?

1158
00:41:07,399 --> 00:41:09,069
Yes, go ahead.

1159
00:41:09,069 --> 00:41:10,270
- Will you try with Chungha? - Okay.

1160
00:41:10,270 --> 00:41:11,270
Chungha.

1161
00:41:11,270 --> 00:41:12,270
"Chung".

1162
00:41:12,540 --> 00:41:13,609
Cheonggukjang.

1163
00:41:13,609 --> 00:41:15,310
(Cheonggukjang)

1164
00:41:15,509 --> 00:41:18,009
(What will he say after cheonggukjang?)

1165
00:41:18,009 --> 00:41:19,049
"Chung".

1166
00:41:19,210 --> 00:41:20,279
Cheonggukjang.

1167
00:41:20,680 --> 00:41:21,750
"Ha".

1168
00:41:21,750 --> 00:41:22,750
One serving please.

1169
00:41:23,919 --> 00:41:26,219
(One order of cheonggukjang please.)

1170
00:41:27,089 --> 00:41:28,259
(Satisfied)

1171
00:41:28,259 --> 00:41:29,660
That was funny.

1172
00:41:29,660 --> 00:41:32,859
(His poem satisfies young people these days.)

1173
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:34,200
It was...

1174
00:41:34,230 --> 00:41:35,460
It was very...

1175
00:41:35,700 --> 00:41:37,330
- He let it go. - It's fun.

1176
00:41:37,330 --> 00:41:39,200
- He let go of his ego. - It's fun.

1177
00:41:39,200 --> 00:41:40,600
This is how you should act.

1178
00:41:40,600 --> 00:41:42,100
- Okay. - Exclude love from it.

1179
00:41:42,100 --> 00:41:43,669
- I'm trying. - When you exclude love,

1180
00:41:43,669 --> 00:41:45,839
your acrostic poems become simple and clean.

1181
00:41:45,870 --> 00:41:46,980
This is great.

1182
00:41:46,980 --> 00:41:48,180
(I like your simple and clean acrostic poems.)

1183
00:41:48,509 --> 00:41:49,710
- Se Chan. - Yes?

1184
00:41:49,710 --> 00:41:51,180
Can you make an acrostic poem?

1185
00:41:51,180 --> 00:41:52,850
- Make it with Chungha. - Chungha.

1186
00:41:52,850 --> 00:41:54,549
Really? Okay.

1187
00:41:54,549 --> 00:41:55,620
"Chung".

1188
00:41:56,120 --> 00:41:57,919
On Chungha's face.

1189
00:41:57,919 --> 00:41:59,989
(On Chungha's face)

1190
00:42:00,189 --> 00:42:03,259
(What about my face?)

1191
00:42:03,259 --> 00:42:05,390
- "Ha". - I see some of Haha.

1192
00:42:05,390 --> 00:42:06,759
(I see some of Haha.)

1193
00:42:07,529 --> 00:42:09,669
(There's Haha in Chungha.)

1194
00:42:09,669 --> 00:42:11,430
I'm so sorry.

1195
00:42:11,430 --> 00:42:13,169
I'm sorry. I was in a hurry.

1196
00:42:13,169 --> 00:42:14,870
I prepared it in a hurry. I'm sorry.

1197
00:42:14,870 --> 00:42:16,140
(Don't misunderstand, Chungha.)

1198
00:42:16,140 --> 00:42:18,169
- That was good. - I'm sorry, Chungha.

1199
00:42:18,270 --> 00:42:19,609
It just happened.

1200
00:42:19,609 --> 00:42:20,640
It was good.

1201
00:42:20,640 --> 00:42:21,939
I'm sorry.

1202
00:42:22,040 --> 00:42:23,450
- Okay. - I never thought of that.

1203
00:42:23,450 --> 00:42:24,609
(They make good acrostic poems.)

1204
00:42:24,609 --> 00:42:26,980
- That was good. - Let's welcome...

1205
00:42:26,980 --> 00:42:30,549
Seung Hoon and Seung Yoon of Winner.

1206
00:42:31,419 --> 00:42:33,319
They do well every time they release an album.

1207
00:42:33,319 --> 00:42:35,759
- Just yesterday, - Yes?

1208
00:42:35,759 --> 00:42:37,629
we topped the charts for the fifth time.

1209
00:42:37,629 --> 00:42:38,989
(Winner tops the charts with "Millions" for the fifth time.)

1210
00:42:38,989 --> 00:42:40,560
That's impressive.

1211
00:42:40,830 --> 00:42:42,129
- For the fifth time? - We're happy.

1212
00:42:42,330 --> 00:42:45,669
Since they're here, shouldn't we listen to their song?

1213
00:42:45,669 --> 00:42:47,969
- Let's watch. - I want to see it.

1214
00:42:48,069 --> 00:42:49,370
I want to see it.

1215
00:42:49,509 --> 00:42:52,270
It's been a while since Do Yeon and Chungha had been here.

1216
00:42:52,270 --> 00:42:54,339
Let's start with "Gotta Go".

1217
00:42:54,509 --> 00:42:55,710
Then we'll hear "Millions".

1218
00:42:55,710 --> 00:42:57,149
Lastly, we'll hear I.O.I's song.

1219
00:42:57,149 --> 00:42:58,649
(Last is "Pick Me".)

1220
00:42:58,649 --> 00:42:59,819
- I.O.I. - This is great.

1221
00:42:59,819 --> 00:43:01,350
("Gotta Go", "Millions" and "Pick Me")

1222
00:43:02,250 --> 00:43:04,589
("Gotta Go" by Chungha)

1223
00:43:04,790 --> 00:43:07,520
(12 o'clock with defined moves)

1224
00:43:08,419 --> 00:43:11,129
(She shows midnight with her whole body.)

1225
00:43:11,730 --> 00:43:13,660
(Defined moves and groove)

1226
00:43:13,660 --> 00:43:15,629
(Every detail is perfect.)

1227
00:43:16,129 --> 00:43:18,830
(It's a human clock.)

1228
00:43:18,899 --> 00:43:20,439
(The clock is key.)

1229
00:43:21,600 --> 00:43:23,009
(Energetic)

1230
00:43:23,739 --> 00:43:25,609
(Sexy waves)

1231
00:43:25,609 --> 00:43:27,640
- That's amazing. - She's like a different person.

1232
00:43:27,640 --> 00:43:29,950
(Her presence is powerful even when dancing alone.)

1233
00:43:30,649 --> 00:43:32,609
(The clock dance and the waves are key.)

1234
00:43:32,609 --> 00:43:34,379
I love this part.

1235
00:43:35,080 --> 00:43:36,719
(She falls in love.)

1236
00:43:38,350 --> 00:43:40,719
(Please love my song, "Gotta Go".)

1237
00:43:41,759 --> 00:43:44,430
(Oh no, it's already midnight.)

1238
00:43:45,129 --> 00:43:47,230
This is how it goes.

1239
00:43:47,230 --> 00:43:48,799
- The last part was... - You were amazing.

1240
00:43:48,799 --> 00:43:50,569
- Thank you. - 12 o'clock.

1241
00:43:50,569 --> 00:43:51,629
This was great.

1242
00:43:52,270 --> 00:43:54,299
- This is how we used to do it. - Right.

1243
00:43:54,969 --> 00:43:56,870
- This is how we used to do it. - Right.

1244
00:43:56,870 --> 00:43:58,109
(In 2019, the movement goes up.)

1245
00:43:58,509 --> 00:43:59,910
This is different.

1246
00:43:59,910 --> 00:44:01,109
(Going up is what's trendy now.)

1247
00:44:01,109 --> 00:44:02,910
Next is Winner.

1248
00:44:02,910 --> 00:44:05,350
- Winner. - Let's hear "Millions".

1249
00:44:05,350 --> 00:44:07,580
(Here's "Millions" by Winner.)

1250
00:44:08,680 --> 00:44:11,120
("Millions" by Winner)

1251
00:44:11,189 --> 00:44:13,089
(Cute)

1252
00:44:13,089 --> 00:44:14,719
(Cute feeling)

1253
00:44:15,689 --> 00:44:17,330
(They express the excitement of young boys in love.)

1254
00:44:17,330 --> 00:44:19,660
- Their dancing is so catchy. - It really is.

1255
00:44:19,660 --> 00:44:21,299
- You're doing well. - This is great.

1256
00:44:21,299 --> 00:44:22,460
(It's so good.)

1257
00:44:23,430 --> 00:44:24,430
(It's a delicious dance by Winner.)

1258
00:44:24,430 --> 00:44:26,399
- It's so delicious. - It really is.

1259
00:44:26,640 --> 00:44:30,339
(They dance so well.)

1260
00:44:30,939 --> 00:44:32,980
(Winner is a tasty restaurant of dance.)

1261
00:44:32,980 --> 00:44:34,480
They dance in a delicious way.

1262
00:44:34,480 --> 00:44:36,910
- Thank you. - It looked so delicious.

1263
00:44:36,910 --> 00:44:38,009
It goes like this.

1264
00:44:38,009 --> 00:44:39,250
- It was sweet. - Like this.

1265
00:44:39,250 --> 00:44:40,649
- That was great. - It was sweet.

1266
00:44:40,649 --> 00:44:42,219
- It was delicious. - It was sweet.

1267
00:44:42,450 --> 00:44:44,250
- Your dance was sweet. - Like a tasty restaurant?

1268
00:44:44,790 --> 00:44:46,660
- We enjoyed it. - It's a tasty restaurant.

1269
00:44:46,660 --> 00:44:48,259
Did you hear what Seung Hoon said?

1270
00:44:48,520 --> 00:44:49,989
I said their dance was sweet.

1271
00:44:49,989 --> 00:44:51,029
"It's a tasty restaurant."

1272
00:44:51,830 --> 00:44:53,799
Call us Michelin of idol singers.

1273
00:44:54,200 --> 00:44:56,469
Their dance is sweet.

1274
00:44:56,469 --> 00:44:57,529
It's sweet indeed.

1275
00:44:57,529 --> 00:44:59,600
- Finally... - I.O.I.

1276
00:44:59,600 --> 00:45:01,169
let's hear "Pick Me".

1277
00:45:01,169 --> 00:45:02,739
- "Pick Me"? - It's I.O.I.

1278
00:45:02,739 --> 00:45:04,739
(It's a popular song by I.O.I.)

1279
00:45:04,969 --> 00:45:06,109
This is insane.

1280
00:45:06,109 --> 00:45:07,109
(Let's go back to 2015.)

1281
00:45:07,540 --> 00:45:09,680
("Pick Me" by I.O.I)

1282
00:45:09,750 --> 00:45:12,410
(They reenact the dance perfectly.)

1283
00:45:13,450 --> 00:45:15,549
(Their well-coordinated dance hasn't changed.)

1284
00:45:15,549 --> 00:45:16,689
They're back.

1285
00:45:16,689 --> 00:45:17,850
(It's been a while.)

1286
00:45:17,850 --> 00:45:19,319
(We're also a tasty restaurant of dance.)

1287
00:45:19,489 --> 00:45:20,660
This is amazing.

1288
00:45:20,660 --> 00:45:22,060
(It brings back memories.)

1289
00:45:22,060 --> 00:45:23,629
It's been such a long time.

1290
00:45:23,730 --> 00:45:24,730
(Their bodies remember.)

1291
00:45:24,730 --> 00:45:26,399
(It's the same angle and turn.)

1292
00:45:26,460 --> 00:45:29,600
(The turning is perfect.)

1293
00:45:29,799 --> 00:45:31,230
This is it.

1294
00:45:31,230 --> 00:45:32,899
(Neither of them forgot the dance.)

1295
00:45:33,339 --> 00:45:34,899
(It's been a warm up until now.)

1296
00:45:34,899 --> 00:45:36,270
Let's go. Here they go.

1297
00:45:36,910 --> 00:45:39,839
(Here comes the insane highlight that shook the country.)

1298
00:45:39,839 --> 00:45:40,839
Let's go.

1299
00:45:41,210 --> 00:45:42,839
(Prepare your fingers.)

1300
00:45:42,839 --> 00:45:44,480
(Start poking!)

1301
00:45:44,480 --> 00:45:45,549
Come on.

1302
00:45:45,549 --> 00:45:46,580
(Everyone pokes.)

1303
00:45:47,020 --> 00:45:50,149
(They get drunk on "Pick Me".)

1304
00:45:50,419 --> 00:45:53,089
(I.O.I dance isn't finished yet.)

1305
00:45:53,189 --> 00:45:55,719
(It's everyone's favorite crab leg dance.)

1306
00:45:56,120 --> 00:45:57,189
This is it.

1307
00:45:57,489 --> 00:45:58,629
That's amazing.

1308
00:45:58,629 --> 00:45:59,700
(She still has the arm spin.)

1309
00:46:00,399 --> 00:46:02,560
(Copy and paste)

1310
00:46:02,899 --> 00:46:04,870
(They leave the frame as they dance.)

1311
00:46:04,870 --> 00:46:06,540
(Haha is out of it.)

1312
00:46:07,739 --> 00:46:12,009
(They finish reenacting "Pick Me".)

1313
00:46:12,040 --> 00:46:13,180
That was great.

1314
00:46:13,439 --> 00:46:14,439
(It's an addicting dance.)

1315
00:46:14,439 --> 00:46:15,509
They dance well.

1316
00:46:15,609 --> 00:46:17,180
I remember how moving it was back then.

1317
00:46:17,180 --> 00:46:19,180
- How do they turn them? - That's amazing.

1318
00:46:19,180 --> 00:46:21,080
How do they do it?

1319
00:46:21,149 --> 00:46:24,290
- You can do it too. - I can?

1320
00:46:24,890 --> 00:46:26,149
Did I do it?

1321
00:46:26,819 --> 00:46:27,919
- What? - That's amazing.

1322
00:46:27,919 --> 00:46:29,419
You looked great like an idol singer.

1323
00:46:29,419 --> 00:46:30,759
- Did I do it? - You look like an idol singer.

1324
00:46:30,759 --> 00:46:31,930
- Did I do it? - That was amazing.

1325
00:46:31,930 --> 00:46:32,989
Try it, Jae Seok.

1326
00:46:33,160 --> 00:46:34,759
(They succeed in teasing him.)

1327
00:46:34,759 --> 00:46:37,169
- He can do it. - I don't know.

1328
00:46:37,629 --> 00:46:38,730
Are you taking classes?

1329
00:46:38,730 --> 00:46:40,100
- No. - Look at him.

1330
00:46:40,100 --> 00:46:42,040
They dance so deliciously.

1331
00:46:42,040 --> 00:46:43,370
- It's sweet. - I know.

1332
00:46:43,710 --> 00:46:44,969
We're a tasty restaurant.

1333
00:46:45,069 --> 00:46:46,810
They're a tasty restaurant indeed.

1334
00:46:46,810 --> 00:46:48,509
What do we do now?

1335
00:46:48,509 --> 00:46:50,480
Here's your second mission where you can earn mission money.

1336
00:46:50,879 --> 00:46:53,250
Here's your second mission where you can earn mission money.

1337
00:46:53,250 --> 00:46:55,149
Door is Falling from the Sky.

1338
00:46:55,379 --> 00:46:58,290
A representative from each team reads a different song title.

1339
00:46:58,290 --> 00:47:01,259
He or she explains the song by dancing.

1340
00:47:01,259 --> 00:47:03,290
The remaining two members guess the correct title to win.

1341
00:47:03,290 --> 00:47:05,560
Every time you guess correctly,

1342
00:47:05,560 --> 00:47:08,529
doors of other teams are lowered.

1343
00:47:09,330 --> 00:47:11,299
(The team whose door is lowered to the bottom loses.)

1344
00:47:11,969 --> 00:47:13,439
Tall people have a disadvantage.

1345
00:47:13,439 --> 00:47:15,569
All four of them dance well.

1346
00:47:15,569 --> 00:47:16,609
Right.

1347
00:47:16,609 --> 00:47:19,069
Among four guests, clans may pick...

1348
00:47:19,069 --> 00:47:20,180
one each.

1349
00:47:20,180 --> 00:47:21,210
- Seung Hoon. - Really?

1350
00:47:21,210 --> 00:47:22,379
- Yes. - Do you pick Seung Hoon?

1351
00:47:22,410 --> 00:47:23,710
Okay.

1352
00:47:23,710 --> 00:47:24,710
(Seok Jin and Kwang Soo pick Chungha.)

1353
00:47:24,710 --> 00:47:26,250
- Hello. - Hello.

1354
00:47:26,250 --> 00:47:28,450
- Seung Yoon is good. - He dances well.

1355
00:47:28,450 --> 00:47:30,350
Seung Yoon is great. Okay.

1356
00:47:30,350 --> 00:47:31,819
(Jae Seok, Haha, Do Yeon versus Jong Kook, So Min, and Seung Hoon)

1357
00:47:31,819 --> 00:47:33,319
(Kwang Soo, Seok Jin, Chungha versus Ji Hyo, Se Chan, and Seung Yoon)

1358
00:47:33,919 --> 00:47:36,460
(Jae Seok, Haha, Do Yeon versus Jong Kook, So Min, and Seung Hoon)

1359
00:47:36,460 --> 00:47:38,129
I'm confident about this.

1360
00:47:38,129 --> 00:47:39,290
Okay.

1361
00:47:39,290 --> 00:47:40,899
- Do we guess the answer? - Seriously.

1362
00:47:40,899 --> 00:47:42,430
Doors of other teams come down...

1363
00:47:42,430 --> 00:47:43,930
- when we guess correctly. - Let's go. Get ready.

1364
00:47:44,330 --> 00:47:45,399
Start.

1365
00:47:45,399 --> 00:47:46,500
(Round 1 starts.)

1366
00:47:47,270 --> 00:47:49,140
(They start to dance.)

1367
00:47:50,270 --> 00:47:52,169
(Do you know the gun shooting dance?)

1368
00:47:52,169 --> 00:47:54,739
(They must guess the singer and the song title.)

1369
00:47:54,739 --> 00:47:55,879
What is it?

1370
00:47:57,109 --> 00:47:59,149
("Gashina" by SUNMI)

1371
00:47:59,149 --> 00:48:02,580
(It made everyone shoot guns.)

1372
00:48:03,049 --> 00:48:05,689
(She reenacts the key movement perfectly.)

1373
00:48:05,819 --> 00:48:06,960
What is it by SUNMI?

1374
00:48:06,960 --> 00:48:08,859
"Siren"? What was it?

1375
00:48:09,419 --> 00:48:10,489
What was it called?

1376
00:48:10,489 --> 00:48:11,489
(Jae Seok and Haha can't remember the song title.)

1377
00:48:11,589 --> 00:48:13,399
(Seung Hoon is also dancing.)

1378
00:48:14,259 --> 00:48:16,259
(Isn't this dance what I think it is?)

1379
00:48:16,259 --> 00:48:17,370
It's...

1380
00:48:18,870 --> 00:48:20,739
("DDU-DU DDU-DU" by BLACKPINK)

1381
00:48:20,739 --> 00:48:22,770
(The dance is similar, but it has a different energy.)

1382
00:48:23,210 --> 00:48:24,870
- Isn't it "DDU-DU DDU-DU"? - What was it?

1383
00:48:24,870 --> 00:48:26,140
"DDU-DU DDU-DU" by BLACKPINK.

1384
00:48:26,609 --> 00:48:27,680
That's correct.

1385
00:48:27,680 --> 00:48:29,850
(As they answer, Jae Seok and Haha's door lowers.)

1386
00:48:31,009 --> 00:48:32,450
(The door is lowered.)

1387
00:48:32,450 --> 00:48:33,480
What was it?

1388
00:48:34,379 --> 00:48:35,919
When they answer correctly, it comes down.

1389
00:48:35,919 --> 00:48:37,790
Poor Do Yeon.

1390
00:48:37,950 --> 00:48:39,049
What was it?

1391
00:48:39,049 --> 00:48:41,359
- What was it? - I can't remember the title.

1392
00:48:41,960 --> 00:48:43,359
- "Gashina". - "Gashina".

1393
00:48:44,589 --> 00:48:46,830
(Jong Kook and So Min's door goes down.)

1394
00:48:46,830 --> 00:48:48,060
It's "DDU-DU DDU-DU".

1395
00:48:48,060 --> 00:48:49,299
(I'm confident about this too.)

1396
00:48:49,299 --> 00:48:51,069
- It's "Candy" by H.O.T. - "Candy".

1397
00:48:52,129 --> 00:48:53,600
This team is doing so well.

1398
00:48:53,600 --> 00:48:54,600
(Jong Kook, So Min, and Seung Hoon are doing well.)

1399
00:48:55,399 --> 00:48:57,270
(The other team's door is lowered to the second level.)

1400
00:48:57,870 --> 00:48:59,109
Take off your shoes.

1401
00:48:59,109 --> 00:49:00,680
(The door is way too low.)

1402
00:49:01,279 --> 00:49:03,180
(I know this song.)

1403
00:49:04,009 --> 00:49:05,350
- I know. - What was it?

1404
00:49:05,350 --> 00:49:06,680
- It's by Rain. - Rain.

1405
00:49:06,680 --> 00:49:08,080
It's by Rain.

1406
00:49:08,279 --> 00:49:10,290
- What was the song? - What was it?

1407
00:49:10,549 --> 00:49:12,890
(Come on, it's "Rainism".)

1408
00:49:13,660 --> 00:49:15,819
- "It's Raining" by Rain. - "It's Raining".

1409
00:49:15,819 --> 00:49:16,859
- Isn't it? - "3!4!".

1410
00:49:16,960 --> 00:49:17,960
3, 4.

1411
00:49:17,960 --> 00:49:19,160
It's by Roo'ra.

1412
00:49:19,160 --> 00:49:21,000
("3!4!" by Roo'ra is correct.)

1413
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:22,160
- Roo'ra. - "3!4!".

1414
00:49:22,160 --> 00:49:24,100
(My clan is doing well.)

1415
00:49:24,230 --> 00:49:25,299
- I know. - Cheer up, baby

1416
00:49:25,299 --> 00:49:26,569
("CHEER UP" by TWICE is correct.)

1417
00:49:26,640 --> 00:49:28,239
- Cheer up, baby - "It's Raining".

1418
00:49:28,239 --> 00:49:29,299
(The door is lowered.)

1419
00:49:29,299 --> 00:49:30,969
(It hits his head.)

1420
00:49:32,040 --> 00:49:34,009
When did it come down? Isn't it "It's Raining"?

1421
00:49:34,180 --> 00:49:35,879
- "It's Raining"? - "Bad Boy".

1422
00:49:35,879 --> 00:49:36,950
"Bad Boy".

1423
00:49:37,609 --> 00:49:39,549
- Is it "Cheer Up, Baby"? - Guess the answer.

1424
00:49:39,549 --> 00:49:40,819
Take off your shoes.

1425
00:49:41,279 --> 00:49:42,419
Take off your shoes, Do Yeon.

1426
00:49:43,149 --> 00:49:44,549
"10 Out of 10".

1427
00:49:44,790 --> 00:49:46,120
- "10 Out of 10". - That's correct.

1428
00:49:46,219 --> 00:49:48,560
Do Yeon is taking off her heels.

1429
00:49:48,560 --> 00:49:50,489
Take off your shoes, Seung Hoon.

1430
00:49:50,589 --> 00:49:51,589
Pass.

1431
00:49:52,460 --> 00:49:54,230
(Look at my heart.)

1432
00:49:54,230 --> 00:49:56,870
- "My Heart"... - "Like Being Shot By A Gun".

1433
00:49:56,870 --> 00:49:58,000
- It's not. - What is it?

1434
00:49:58,000 --> 00:49:59,299
"My Heart"?

1435
00:49:59,299 --> 00:50:00,700
- What is it? - Are you cold?

1436
00:50:00,700 --> 00:50:01,799
(His heart beats.)

1437
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:03,239
(We know what it is immediately.)

1438
00:50:03,239 --> 00:50:04,609
- I know. - I understood.

1439
00:50:04,609 --> 00:50:06,710
- That's it. - That's a good expression.

1440
00:50:06,710 --> 00:50:08,540
(Don't you know what it is?)

1441
00:50:08,640 --> 00:50:10,109
- "My Heart Breaks"? - "Heart Flutters".

1442
00:50:10,350 --> 00:50:12,180
- "Heart Attack". - "Heart Attack".

1443
00:50:12,180 --> 00:50:13,680
("Heart Attack" by AOA is correct.)

1444
00:50:13,680 --> 00:50:14,750
That's right.

1445
00:50:14,750 --> 00:50:16,180
What is it? Wait.

1446
00:50:16,180 --> 00:50:17,250
Pass.

1447
00:50:17,689 --> 00:50:18,719
Pass.

1448
00:50:18,719 --> 00:50:19,790
(She passes "Into the New World".)

1449
00:50:19,790 --> 00:50:21,520
(Next is "Adult Ceremony" by Park Ji Yoon)

1450
00:50:22,359 --> 00:50:24,989
(The sexy wave is key.)

1451
00:50:25,189 --> 00:50:26,189
That?

1452
00:50:26,230 --> 00:50:28,029
- I know. It's "Adult Ceremony". - Right.

1453
00:50:28,029 --> 00:50:30,230
- "Adult Ceremony" by Park Ji Yoon. - "Adult Ceremony" by Park Ji Yoon.

1454
00:50:30,370 --> 00:50:32,230
(It's impossible to stand up.)

1455
00:50:32,569 --> 00:50:33,669
What is it?

1456
00:50:33,669 --> 00:50:35,370
- What was it? - "Bo Peep Bo Peep"?

1457
00:50:35,569 --> 00:50:36,839
"Hot"?

1458
00:50:36,839 --> 00:50:40,410
- "So Hot". - "So Hot" by Wonder Girls.

1459
00:50:40,509 --> 00:50:42,009
(Lowering)

1460
00:50:43,140 --> 00:50:45,149
(She can't even sit down.)

1461
00:50:46,719 --> 00:50:48,719
(She gets up and moves her feet.)

1462
00:50:48,719 --> 00:50:50,719
I know it. What is it?

1463
00:50:50,919 --> 00:50:54,790
(The feet dance is the signature movement of "Alone".)

1464
00:50:54,790 --> 00:50:56,989
What is it? Oh, SISTAR!

1465
00:50:57,330 --> 00:50:58,930
- It's SISTAR's... - It's "Alone".

1466
00:50:58,930 --> 00:51:00,560
I eat all alone

1467
00:51:00,600 --> 00:51:02,629
- It's "Alone". - You're right.

1468
00:51:02,629 --> 00:51:03,730
It's "Alone".

1469
00:51:03,730 --> 00:51:05,870
(This side moves down too as Jae Seok answers correctly.)

1470
00:51:07,069 --> 00:51:09,640
- Girls' Generation. - Yes. What was that song's name?

1471
00:51:09,640 --> 00:51:11,339
- Girls' Generation. - From where was the arrow dance?

1472
00:51:11,339 --> 00:51:13,270
- It's "Hoot". - Right, it's "Hoot".

1473
00:51:13,439 --> 00:51:15,339
- Now... - I spend the night alone

1474
00:51:15,339 --> 00:51:18,080
- Miss A. Yes or no? - Miss A.

1475
00:51:18,080 --> 00:51:20,879
- It's "Bad Girl, Good Girl". - Oh, "Bad Girl, Good Girl".

1476
00:51:21,419 --> 00:51:22,950
(She gets completely pressed down by the other team's answer.)

1477
00:51:22,950 --> 00:51:24,120
- What? - "Bad Girl, Good Girl".

1478
00:51:24,120 --> 00:51:25,950
- "Bad Girl, Good Girl". - What is that?

1479
00:51:25,950 --> 00:51:28,219
- They're good. - Please. What should we do?

1480
00:51:28,219 --> 00:51:29,589
It's such a close match.

1481
00:51:29,960 --> 00:51:31,960
- Are you running? - Are you looking and running?

1482
00:51:32,330 --> 00:51:33,529
Are you looking and running?

1483
00:51:33,529 --> 00:51:35,899
- I know. It's Wonder Girls. - Are you looking and running?

1484
00:51:35,899 --> 00:51:37,969
(Which clan will be the first to shout out the answer?)

1485
00:51:39,560 --> 00:51:41,560
- Are you running? - Are you looking and running?

1486
00:51:41,930 --> 00:51:43,129
Are you looking and running?

1487
00:51:43,129 --> 00:51:45,199
- I know. It's Wonder Girls. - Are you looking and running?

1488
00:51:45,223 --> 00:51:46,863
(The left team isn't sure, but the right team got Wonder Girls.)

1489
00:51:46,863 --> 00:51:52,232
(Jae Seok and Haha only need to guess the title to win.)

1490
00:51:52,319 --> 00:51:54,720
- "Tell Me". - It's this. "Tell Me".

1491
00:51:54,720 --> 00:51:56,149
(Jae Seok, Haha, and Do Yeon win.)

1492
00:51:56,149 --> 00:51:57,560
Okay. We won.

1493
00:51:58,089 --> 00:51:59,459
- That's a relief. - My goodness.

1494
00:51:59,459 --> 00:52:00,959
- That's a relief. - My goodness.

1495
00:52:01,430 --> 00:52:02,729
(The door comes down to the last level.)

1496
00:52:02,729 --> 00:52:04,529
(He feels sad.)

1497
00:52:04,759 --> 00:52:06,959
Hey, it's okay. You did well.

1498
00:52:07,129 --> 00:52:08,129
He did well.

1499
00:52:08,629 --> 00:52:11,140
- He did really well. - There were many correct answers.

1500
00:52:11,140 --> 00:52:12,270
(Jae Seok, Haha, and Do Yeon win.)

1501
00:52:13,240 --> 00:52:15,370
- I hope I do it well. - If we lose, it'll be our fault.

1502
00:52:16,169 --> 00:52:18,810
- You can do it! - Let's do it!

1503
00:52:18,810 --> 00:52:20,109
- You can do it! - Let's do it!

1504
00:52:20,109 --> 00:52:21,609
- Let's win! - Let go!

1505
00:52:21,609 --> 00:52:22,709
Let's begin. Get ready.

1506
00:52:22,709 --> 00:52:25,180
(Round 2 starts.)

1507
00:52:25,680 --> 00:52:26,720
("TT" by TWICE)

1508
00:52:27,089 --> 00:52:28,149
- "TT". - "TT".

1509
00:52:29,020 --> 00:52:30,189
- "TT". - "TT".

1510
00:52:30,189 --> 00:52:32,160
(The door gets lowered.)

1511
00:52:32,160 --> 00:52:33,359
(It's right above me.)

1512
00:52:34,359 --> 00:52:36,430
- "Goodbye" by Hong Jin Young. - It's "Goodbye".

1513
00:52:37,660 --> 00:52:39,200
("Like a Cat" by AOA)

1514
00:52:39,200 --> 00:52:40,600
(He mouths the lyrics.)

1515
00:52:40,870 --> 00:52:42,430
- "Like a Cat" by AOA! - "Like a Cat".

1516
00:52:42,430 --> 00:52:43,799
Hey, you can't mouth it.

1517
00:52:43,799 --> 00:52:46,270
- He mouthed it. - That's a bit too much.

1518
00:52:46,270 --> 00:52:47,669
What are you talking about? Nonsense.

1519
00:52:47,669 --> 00:52:48,910
Don't mouth it.

1520
00:52:49,669 --> 00:52:51,209
("Mr. Chu" by Apink)

1521
00:52:51,209 --> 00:52:52,939
"Mr. Chu" by Apink!

1522
00:52:52,939 --> 00:52:55,509
(He shouts out the answer very correctly.)

1523
00:52:55,910 --> 00:52:57,379
You know Apink indeed.

1524
00:52:58,080 --> 00:52:59,720
You know everything about Apink.

1525
00:52:59,720 --> 00:53:01,720
(Chungha's door got lowered a lot.)

1526
00:53:01,720 --> 00:53:04,319
("Up and Down" by EXID)

1527
00:53:04,319 --> 00:53:06,220
- "Up and Down"! - "Up and Down".

1528
00:53:06,720 --> 00:53:08,430
Hurry up. Give us the next one!

1529
00:53:08,430 --> 00:53:09,790
Just give us the next one!

1530
00:53:09,990 --> 00:53:11,830
- Do what you can with the title. - Try anything you can.

1531
00:53:13,160 --> 00:53:15,129
- That's difficult. - My goodness.

1532
00:53:15,129 --> 00:53:16,700
("We Are the Future" by H.O.T.)

1533
00:53:17,169 --> 00:53:20,740
(This song was released in 1997 when Seung Yoon was 4 years old.)

1534
00:53:20,740 --> 00:53:22,310
Just try what you can. That's right.

1535
00:53:22,939 --> 00:53:25,509
(Since I don't know the song, I'll mouth the lyrics.)

1536
00:53:25,509 --> 00:53:27,310
It's "We Are the Future" by H.O.T.

1537
00:53:28,009 --> 00:53:29,410
Gosh, how did you get this one?

1538
00:53:30,310 --> 00:53:32,620
- My gosh. - It's like he's watching TV.

1539
00:53:33,580 --> 00:53:34,990
This is all that I remember.

1540
00:53:34,990 --> 00:53:36,189
We're sorry, Chungha!

1541
00:53:36,850 --> 00:53:38,819
We're very sorry, Chungha!

1542
00:53:38,819 --> 00:53:39,819
- We don't know. - I can't get it at all.

1543
00:53:39,819 --> 00:53:42,830
Look at Chungha. She's suffering because of her bad team.

1544
00:53:43,529 --> 00:53:45,529
(This side is relaxed because of his good team.)

1545
00:53:46,430 --> 00:53:47,770
(This is easy. I can do this.)

1546
00:53:47,770 --> 00:53:49,330
("Really Really" by Winner)

1547
00:53:49,330 --> 00:53:50,330
(This is our dance.)

1548
00:53:50,330 --> 00:53:53,399
It's "Really Really" by Winner!

1549
00:53:53,870 --> 00:53:56,209
(Chungha's door falls down to the last stage by his answer.)

1550
00:53:56,209 --> 00:53:58,140
Chungha, are you okay?

1551
00:53:58,140 --> 00:53:59,140
(I couldn't even start the dance.)

1552
00:53:59,140 --> 00:54:01,810
- Chungha, are you okay? - Chungha.

1553
00:54:01,810 --> 00:54:02,810
(Seok Jin, Kwang Soo, and Chungha lose.)

1554
00:54:02,810 --> 00:54:05,319
- Seung Yoon. - Seung Yoon, you did great.

1555
00:54:05,319 --> 00:54:07,319
- We got so many correct. - You did really great.

1556
00:54:07,319 --> 00:54:09,020
Chungha, you're going through so much.

1557
00:54:09,020 --> 00:54:10,520
This is so...

1558
00:54:10,520 --> 00:54:12,919
Why can't you get the answers?

1559
00:54:14,589 --> 00:54:16,189
Let's go to the finals.

1560
00:54:16,189 --> 00:54:17,899
- Let's go to the finals. - Let go.

1561
00:54:17,899 --> 00:54:19,060
(Ji Hyo, Se Chan, and Seung Yoon win.)

1562
00:54:19,160 --> 00:54:20,870
When Seung Yoon was in a rush earlier,

1563
00:54:21,069 --> 00:54:23,200
(We saw that, Seung Yoon.)

1564
00:54:23,669 --> 00:54:25,700
(It was a parade of lip syncs.)

1565
00:54:26,339 --> 00:54:27,669
(Good one.)

1566
00:54:27,669 --> 00:54:28,709
Why did you do that?

1567
00:54:28,709 --> 00:54:30,209
- Let's do this. - We can do this!

1568
00:54:30,209 --> 00:54:31,680
- I feel great. - Let's go, Do Yeon.

1569
00:54:31,879 --> 00:54:33,640
Their team won once already.

1570
00:54:33,810 --> 00:54:35,410
Get ready!

1571
00:54:35,410 --> 00:54:37,720
(The finals start.)

1572
00:54:38,979 --> 00:54:41,689
(The skilled dance moves are fit for the finals.)

1573
00:54:42,490 --> 00:54:44,319
- It's BigBang. - "Bang Bang Bang".

1574
00:54:44,319 --> 00:54:45,790
- "Bang Bang Bang". - "Bang Bang Bang" by BigBang.

1575
00:54:45,790 --> 00:54:47,330
- You're right! - It's "Bang Bang Bang".

1576
00:54:47,330 --> 00:54:48,560
(We need to hurry.)

1577
00:54:48,959 --> 00:54:50,229
(I know the title, but...)

1578
00:54:50,229 --> 00:54:52,330
- It's I.O.I. - It's "Very Very Very" by I.O.I.

1579
00:54:52,330 --> 00:54:54,330
- It's a close match indeed. - What are they doing?

1580
00:54:54,899 --> 00:54:57,069
("Bboom Bboom" by Momoland)

1581
00:54:57,069 --> 00:54:58,370
- That's... - It's "Bboom Bboom".

1582
00:54:58,370 --> 00:55:01,040
- It's "Bboom Bboom" by Momoland. - You're right!

1583
00:55:01,910 --> 00:55:03,979
This one's difficult. Se Chan's team has to get a difficult one.

1584
00:55:03,979 --> 00:55:05,810
(Ji Hyo, Se Chan, and Seung Yoon got stuck with "Signal".)

1585
00:55:05,810 --> 00:55:06,839
You can choose.

1586
00:55:07,140 --> 00:55:09,009
You have a bad headache?

1587
00:55:10,149 --> 00:55:11,319
(This is our chance.)

1588
00:55:11,319 --> 00:55:13,350
(She shakes her hips.)

1589
00:55:13,620 --> 00:55:15,419
(The song they sang out was this.)

1590
00:55:15,950 --> 00:55:20,520
("Mister" by KARA)

1591
00:55:21,459 --> 00:55:23,560
- It's "Mister". - It's by...

1592
00:55:23,589 --> 00:55:25,160
The group's name...

1593
00:55:25,160 --> 00:55:27,569
- The group Koo Ha Ra is in. - The name is...

1594
00:55:27,729 --> 00:55:30,370
That group's agency was DSP Media.

1595
00:55:30,970 --> 00:55:33,370
- This is embarrassing. - What was their name?

1596
00:55:33,370 --> 00:55:35,870
- KARA! - KARA!

1597
00:55:36,310 --> 00:55:38,810
This one. I know this. It's "Gee" by Girls' Generation.

1598
00:55:38,810 --> 00:55:40,140
"Gee" by Girls' Generation.

1599
00:55:41,450 --> 00:55:44,180
(Getting two answers in a row...)

1600
00:55:44,180 --> 00:55:45,979
(brings the door down a lot.)

1601
00:55:45,979 --> 00:55:47,620
- That was fast. - I know this.

1602
00:55:48,020 --> 00:55:50,520
- It's "Fire" by BTS. - "Fire".

1603
00:55:50,589 --> 00:55:52,819
- "Fire". - It's "Fire" by BTS.

1604
00:55:53,419 --> 00:55:54,430
(She keeps on with the dance moves.)

1605
00:55:54,430 --> 00:55:56,430
I've seen this. What was this?

1606
00:55:56,430 --> 00:55:58,859
- It's "Growl" by EXO. - "Growl".

1607
00:56:01,029 --> 00:56:03,270
- "Don't Leave Me", Park Jin Young. - Yes, Park Jin Young.

1608
00:56:03,270 --> 00:56:04,939
Do Yeon is really good.

1609
00:56:05,169 --> 00:56:07,200
- She knows all dance moves. - She's really good.

1610
00:56:07,910 --> 00:56:10,009
(The parade of correct answers makes him start lying down.)

1611
00:56:10,009 --> 00:56:11,180
My goodness.

1612
00:56:11,180 --> 00:56:12,509
(It's this! The kicking dance!)

1613
00:56:12,509 --> 00:56:16,180
It's SISTAR. SISTAR!

1614
00:56:17,209 --> 00:56:19,419
(We know these leg moves.)

1615
00:56:19,419 --> 00:56:22,319
- SISTAR! - No, it's "Genie".

1616
00:56:22,319 --> 00:56:23,319
(Can you guess what that is?)

1617
00:56:23,589 --> 00:56:27,189
(It's the dance from "Genie" by Girls' Generation.)

1618
00:56:27,759 --> 00:56:29,160
(He mouths it again.)

1619
00:56:29,160 --> 00:56:31,259
It's Girls' Generation. What was the title?

1620
00:56:31,259 --> 00:56:32,359
(What is this?)

1621
00:56:32,830 --> 00:56:34,169
- Hold on. - It starts with a G.

1622
00:56:34,169 --> 00:56:35,370
What was it?

1623
00:56:35,370 --> 00:56:37,229
(He starts mouthing the words.)

1624
00:56:37,899 --> 00:56:38,939
This foot?

1625
00:56:40,500 --> 00:56:42,410
(The lip sync failed.)

1626
00:56:42,709 --> 00:56:44,310
- Hold on. - My goodness.

1627
00:56:44,310 --> 00:56:46,180
(What does a foot have to do with this?)

1628
00:56:47,109 --> 00:56:48,209
(While Ji Hyo and Se Chan can't get the answer...)

1629
00:56:48,209 --> 00:56:50,450
- It looks like a train. - Is it a train?

1630
00:56:51,350 --> 00:56:52,919
- Hold on. - What is this?

1631
00:56:53,450 --> 00:56:55,149
"Lies" by BigBang.

1632
00:56:55,149 --> 00:56:57,049
- No, it isn't "Lies". - It's "Genie".

1633
00:56:57,049 --> 00:56:58,089
"Genie".

1634
00:56:58,819 --> 00:57:00,689
(They finally got "Genie" by Girls' Generation.)

1635
00:57:01,930 --> 00:57:03,359
(No, no.)

1636
00:57:03,359 --> 00:57:05,899
- That's "No No No" by Apink. - "No".

1637
00:57:06,129 --> 00:57:08,169
Okay. "No No No" by Apink.

1638
00:57:08,169 --> 00:57:09,899
(They start catching up on the verge of losing.)

1639
00:57:09,899 --> 00:57:12,439
- We don't know how this will end. - Just one more.

1640
00:57:12,439 --> 00:57:14,040
- What is that? - Gosh, this one is difficult.

1641
00:57:14,140 --> 00:57:16,410
- It's by Brown Eyed Girls. - "Abracadabra".

1642
00:57:16,410 --> 00:57:18,379
- "Abracadabra". - "Abracadabra".

1643
00:57:18,939 --> 00:57:20,140
Hey, you only need one more.

1644
00:57:20,850 --> 00:57:23,080
- They caught up. - We only needed one more.

1645
00:57:23,779 --> 00:57:25,319
- SISTAR. - This one is...

1646
00:57:25,450 --> 00:57:26,580
It's something by SISTAR.

1647
00:57:28,189 --> 00:57:29,819
- Come on. - Come on.

1648
00:57:29,819 --> 00:57:30,919
(Jae Seok and Haha only need to get "Shake It" to win.)

1649
00:57:31,189 --> 00:57:33,160
- "Look at me"? - What is that?

1650
00:57:33,160 --> 00:57:35,729
(Ji Hyo and Se Chan are clueless...)

1651
00:57:35,729 --> 00:57:38,259
(while Jae Seok and Haha just need to guess the title.)

1652
00:57:38,259 --> 00:57:41,430
- "Shake It". - "Shake It"!

1653
00:57:41,430 --> 00:57:43,970
(Jae Seok, Haha, and Do Yeon finally got the answer.)

1654
00:57:45,140 --> 00:57:47,040
(It's a narrow defeat for Ji Hyo, Se Chan, and Seung Yoon.)

1655
00:57:47,040 --> 00:57:48,970
- We won! - Yes!

1656
00:57:49,109 --> 00:57:50,339
I can't believe we lost there.

1657
00:57:50,339 --> 00:57:51,509
(Jae Seok and Haha win again thanks to Do Yeon's dance moves.)

1658
00:57:51,509 --> 00:57:53,180
- This is amazing. - You and I...

1659
00:57:53,180 --> 00:57:54,810
took up too much time here.

1660
00:57:54,810 --> 00:57:57,720
- "Genie" was... - We took too long here.

1661
00:58:00,120 --> 00:58:02,350
The winner of Door is Falling from the Sky...

1662
00:58:02,350 --> 00:58:04,189
is Jae Seok and Haha's clan.

1663
00:58:04,189 --> 00:58:06,890
- This is all thanks to you. - I can't believe this.

1664
00:58:06,919 --> 00:58:09,089
- Jae Seok is really... - After they teamed up,

1665
00:58:09,089 --> 00:58:10,359
they keep winning.

1666
00:58:10,359 --> 00:58:12,029
That was great. Seriously, Do Yeon.

1667
00:58:12,029 --> 00:58:14,370
- Jae Seok is great for answers. - This team is great indeed.

1668
00:58:14,729 --> 00:58:16,729
This is great indeed.

1669
00:58:16,729 --> 00:58:18,169
We're a great team.

1670
00:58:18,169 --> 00:58:19,540
(I want to join them too.)

1671
00:58:19,540 --> 00:58:22,040
The prize money depends on the winning team's guest.

1672
00:58:22,069 --> 00:58:24,279
Do Yeon has to do jegichagi,

1673
00:58:24,879 --> 00:58:26,979
and the mission budget depends on how many times she succeeds.

1674
00:58:26,979 --> 00:58:28,209
How much is it for each kick?

1675
00:58:28,209 --> 00:58:30,149
We'll give 10 dollars for each successful kick.

1676
00:58:30,149 --> 00:58:32,319
(The mission budget will be equal to the kick count times 10 dollars.)

1677
00:58:32,319 --> 00:58:34,149
- Can you do it well? - How many times can you do it?

1678
00:58:34,149 --> 00:58:36,120
- I'm not good with jegichagi. - How many times can you do it?

1679
00:58:36,120 --> 00:58:39,359
- Gosh, this is... - It's 100 dollars with 10 kicks.

1680
00:58:39,620 --> 00:58:40,830
- If she kicks it a lot... - Even two kicks is a lot.

1681
00:58:40,830 --> 00:58:42,930
- Even two kicks is a lot. - Of course, that is.

1682
00:58:42,930 --> 00:58:45,759
- Let's do this, Do Yeon. - You can do it.

1683
00:58:46,060 --> 00:58:48,600
- Just do it three times. - She won't be able to do that.

1684
00:58:48,799 --> 00:58:50,899
Just one. One is fine.

1685
00:58:51,140 --> 00:58:53,040
- Let's go! - Okay, let's do it well.

1686
00:58:53,240 --> 00:58:55,209
- She's getting nervous. - Don't try to be funny.

1687
00:58:55,209 --> 00:58:56,310
She's trembling.

1688
00:58:56,310 --> 00:58:59,279
Do Yeon, your time has come.

1689
00:59:00,209 --> 00:59:01,810
(What?)

1690
00:59:03,509 --> 00:59:05,120
(She kicked it only once and gained 10 dollars.)

1691
00:59:05,120 --> 00:59:06,680
- Is it just once? - It's just once.

1692
00:59:06,680 --> 00:59:08,149
- It was just once. - Once.

1693
00:59:08,649 --> 00:59:11,020
- It's okay, Do Yeon. - At least she got one.

1694
00:59:11,459 --> 00:59:12,689
(Jae Suk and Haha gain 10 dollars with 1 kick.)

1695
00:59:12,689 --> 00:59:14,459
Here's 10 dollars for the mission budget.

1696
00:59:14,459 --> 00:59:17,729
Jae Seok won all day long, but he's poor and on Level Two.

1697
00:59:18,459 --> 00:59:20,899
No, he still Level One.

1698
00:59:22,229 --> 00:59:25,000
Anyway, today's episode is great thanks to the four of you.

1699
00:59:25,000 --> 00:59:26,370
- It's great. - Thank you.

1700
00:59:26,370 --> 00:59:28,209
(Thank you, Seung Yoon, Seung Hoon, Chungha, and Do Yeon.)

1701
00:59:28,209 --> 00:59:30,109
- This is great. - I know, right?

1702
00:59:30,109 --> 00:59:32,580
(Jae Seok and Haha are in the lead after Round 2.)

1703
00:59:33,279 --> 00:59:35,450
The Secret Room quest has become available.

1704
00:59:35,450 --> 00:59:37,850
Choose your room and begin your quest.

1705
00:59:38,049 --> 00:59:40,720
- Hey, don't tell them anything. - Okay.

1706
00:59:40,720 --> 00:59:42,720
We really shouldn't tell them anything.

1707
00:59:42,720 --> 00:59:44,560
- It will end if we do. - That's what I mean.

1708
00:59:44,560 --> 00:59:46,189
It's over for us if we reveal each other's secrets.

1709
00:59:46,189 --> 00:59:47,490
It's pointless for us now.

1710
00:59:47,490 --> 00:59:49,129
- We're done for today already. - That face...

1711
00:59:49,129 --> 00:59:50,259
I'm being serious.

1712
00:59:50,689 --> 00:59:52,330
But Kwang Soo, that should never happen.

1713
00:59:52,560 --> 00:59:54,000
- Are you choosing Room A? - Yes.

1714
00:59:54,000 --> 00:59:55,600
- But seriously, this is... - I'm being serious too.

1715
00:59:55,700 --> 00:59:57,569
- Seok Jin, we should... - Please don't do it.

1716
00:59:57,569 --> 00:59:59,770
We failed two weeks ago. Seriously.

1717
00:59:59,770 --> 01:00:01,270
We really have to stick with each other.

1718
01:00:02,339 --> 01:00:03,410
Please.

1719
01:00:03,870 --> 01:00:04,979
Hello.

1720
01:00:04,979 --> 01:00:06,779
(Will they stay together?)

1721
01:00:08,080 --> 01:00:11,520
(A quest has been discovered.)

1722
01:00:11,879 --> 01:00:13,520
The Secret Room quest.

1723
01:00:13,549 --> 01:00:15,819
Will you lower a level of your own...

1724
01:00:15,890 --> 01:00:17,990
or reveal your clan's secret?

1725
01:00:19,189 --> 01:00:21,589
(The clan that is behind must pick between their level and secrets.)

1726
01:00:21,589 --> 01:00:23,990
(He's troubled.)

1727
01:00:25,000 --> 01:00:26,299
(Will you lower a level of your own...)

1728
01:00:26,299 --> 01:00:27,629
(or reveal your clan's secret?)

1729
01:00:27,629 --> 01:00:28,770
I'll reveal the secret.

1730
01:00:28,770 --> 01:00:31,339
(He doesn't even read about the quest.)

1731
01:00:32,799 --> 01:00:33,970
I'll reveal the secret.

1732
01:00:34,509 --> 01:00:37,140
Please tell us what you will do after thinking carefully.

1733
01:00:37,709 --> 01:00:38,839
I'll reveal the secret.

1734
01:00:38,839 --> 01:00:41,979
(He's more careful than ever.)

1735
01:00:42,310 --> 01:00:43,549
I'll reveal the secret.

1736
01:00:44,979 --> 01:00:48,189
(Seok Jin and Kwang Soo both keep their levels.)

1737
01:00:50,350 --> 01:00:52,189
- Follow your instincts, So Min. - See you later.

1738
01:00:52,189 --> 01:00:53,520
- No pressure. - Okay.

1739
01:00:53,520 --> 01:00:55,990
What? I can't open the door. This is locked.

1740
01:00:56,359 --> 01:00:57,629
Hello.

1741
01:00:57,629 --> 01:00:58,930
(A quest has been discovered.)

1742
01:00:58,930 --> 01:01:00,500
(Will you reduce a level of your own or reveal your clan's secret?)

1743
01:01:00,500 --> 01:01:04,229
(It's the same question Seok Jin and Kwang Soo got.)

1744
01:01:04,229 --> 01:01:05,299
Well, Jong Kook...

1745
01:01:05,299 --> 01:01:07,910
(She looks around.)

1746
01:01:07,910 --> 01:01:11,580
I would've revealed it if it wasn't Jong Kook.

1747
01:01:11,580 --> 01:01:12,939
But...

1748
01:01:12,939 --> 01:01:15,350
do you want me to be unable to join next weeks' recording?

1749
01:01:15,350 --> 01:01:16,379
(Do you want me to be unable to join next weeks' recording?)

1750
01:01:18,379 --> 01:01:20,279
Jong Kook won't reveal the secret, right?

1751
01:01:21,089 --> 01:01:22,189
Then...

1752
01:01:22,720 --> 01:01:24,319
I guess I can do it.

1753
01:01:24,319 --> 01:01:27,459
(Traitor mode on)

1754
01:01:28,160 --> 01:01:29,990
Jong Kook won't reveal it anyway.

1755
01:01:29,990 --> 01:01:32,759
(Will she betray her clan as her instincts tell her?)

1756
01:01:32,759 --> 01:01:34,000
Seriously.

1757
01:01:34,470 --> 01:01:36,830
I really wanted to be on good terms with Jong Kook.

1758
01:01:37,500 --> 01:01:38,640
This is driving me crazy.

1759
01:01:39,770 --> 01:01:41,439
Gosh, if the same question is being asked there too,

1760
01:01:41,439 --> 01:01:42,770
what happens if we both choose to reveal the secret?

1761
01:01:43,569 --> 01:01:44,810
However,

1762
01:01:44,810 --> 01:01:47,040
if So Min sees this question,

1763
01:01:47,240 --> 01:01:49,950
I'm sure she will choose to reveal the secret.

1764
01:01:49,950 --> 01:01:50,950
(He's sure of betrayal.)

1765
01:01:50,950 --> 01:01:52,149
I'm sure she will.

1766
01:01:52,779 --> 01:01:55,750
I'm sure she will reveal my secret.

1767
01:01:55,850 --> 01:01:57,089
I'm very sure.

1768
01:01:57,660 --> 01:02:00,120
I will choose...

1769
01:02:01,290 --> 01:02:02,459
to reveal my clan's secret.

1770
01:02:02,459 --> 01:02:06,229
(I will choose to reveal my clan's secret.)

1771
01:02:06,330 --> 01:02:07,430
In that case,

1772
01:02:08,029 --> 01:02:09,430
I'll keep it a secret.

1773
01:02:09,500 --> 01:02:13,640
(What?)

1774
01:02:13,640 --> 01:02:15,640
(She chooses to keep the secret.)

1775
01:02:15,640 --> 01:02:17,240
I know that Jong Kook...

1776
01:02:17,339 --> 01:02:20,009
will not reveal the secret anyway...

1777
01:02:20,140 --> 01:02:21,279
because of his personality.

1778
01:02:21,979 --> 01:02:24,049
I don't want to resent So Min,

1779
01:02:24,049 --> 01:02:25,279
so I choose this.

1780
01:02:25,279 --> 01:02:26,879
(Why do they never match?)

1781
01:02:26,879 --> 01:02:28,490
(Jong Kook keeps his level, and So Min loses her level.)

1782
01:02:28,490 --> 01:02:29,649
(Secret revealed)

1783
01:02:30,149 --> 01:02:31,990
Don't think about it, Se Chan.

1784
01:02:32,790 --> 01:02:34,459
- Which room will you enter? - Room A.

1785
01:02:34,689 --> 01:02:35,830
Then I'll enter Room B.

1786
01:02:36,330 --> 01:02:38,000
I'm all about pink, right?

1787
01:02:38,000 --> 01:02:39,029
Right. Gosh, I was surprised.

1788
01:02:40,859 --> 01:02:43,770
(A quest has been discovered.)

1789
01:02:43,970 --> 01:02:45,970
You can raise your level...

1790
01:02:45,970 --> 01:02:47,810
by revealing your clan's secret.

1791
01:02:47,939 --> 01:02:49,410
- Yes? - Choose carefully.

1792
01:02:49,410 --> 01:02:50,470
I'm being careful.

1793
01:02:50,770 --> 01:02:52,640
I carefully thought about it since this morning.

1794
01:02:53,740 --> 01:02:55,410
I become really harsh sometimes.

1795
01:02:55,410 --> 01:02:56,950
Hey, I'm harsher.

1796
01:02:56,950 --> 01:02:58,680
I might make you take a vacation for about three months.

1797
01:02:59,080 --> 01:03:01,890
This might make you stay off programs. Seriously.

1798
01:03:01,890 --> 01:03:03,649
What? What is it?

1799
01:03:03,649 --> 01:03:05,319
(They seemed to have critical secrets at hand.)

1800
01:03:05,520 --> 01:03:07,419
I carefully thought about it since this morning.

1801
01:03:08,229 --> 01:03:09,560
I'll choose to gain a level.

1802
01:03:09,560 --> 01:03:13,629
(Why do you even ask?)

1803
01:03:13,700 --> 01:03:15,299
I really thought about it since this morning.

1804
01:03:15,370 --> 01:03:16,500
I should raise my level.

1805
01:03:18,399 --> 01:03:20,140
(Tossing)

1806
01:03:20,140 --> 01:03:21,410
(Se Chan gains a level by revealing his clan member's secret.)

1807
01:03:21,410 --> 01:03:22,470
I should grow up.

1808
01:03:22,470 --> 01:03:23,910
I'm trying to grow up, everyone.

1809
01:03:26,310 --> 01:03:28,350
(Meanwhile, Ji Hyo doesn't know what Se Chan chose.)

1810
01:03:28,350 --> 01:03:29,879
"If you eat the honey rice cake in one bite..."

1811
01:03:30,109 --> 01:03:31,620
(A honey rice cake?)

1812
01:03:31,919 --> 01:03:33,319
If you eat the honey rice cake in one bite,

1813
01:03:33,319 --> 01:03:35,220
you can gain a level.

1814
01:03:35,790 --> 01:03:37,990
"you can gain a level. Will you challenge to this?"

1815
01:03:37,990 --> 01:03:39,060
Of course.

1816
01:03:39,220 --> 01:03:40,259
It's done.

1817
01:03:40,520 --> 01:03:43,189
(She eats it without hesitation.)

1818
01:03:43,859 --> 01:03:44,959
(Song Ji Hyo)

1819
01:03:47,200 --> 01:03:49,899
Then do I not need to reveal my clan member's secret?

1820
01:03:50,000 --> 01:03:51,000
Yes, you don't need to.

1821
01:03:51,640 --> 01:03:53,069
Are you sure I only had to eat that honey rice cake?

1822
01:03:53,069 --> 01:03:54,810
(Is it really this easy?)

1823
01:03:54,810 --> 01:03:56,669
Then Haha was right earlier.

1824
01:03:56,793 --> 01:04:00,093

1825
01:04:00,140 --> 01:04:03,109
(Haha entered the secret room after Round 1.)

1826
01:04:03,109 --> 01:04:04,209
Do you want me to eat this in one bite?

1827
01:04:05,379 --> 01:04:06,879
(If you eat the honey rice cake in one bite,)

1828
01:04:06,879 --> 01:04:08,250
(you can gain a level.)

1829
01:04:08,950 --> 01:04:09,950
Of course.

1830
01:04:09,950 --> 01:04:12,089
(Unlike the room Jae Seok entered,)

1831
01:04:12,089 --> 01:04:14,589
(he only had to eat the rice cake to raise his level.)

1832
01:04:15,129 --> 01:04:16,290
Gosh, this is delicious.

1833
01:04:16,290 --> 01:04:17,859
(The secret behind Haha's level-up is finally revealed.)

1834
01:04:17,859 --> 01:04:19,000
Thank you.

1835
01:04:19,000 --> 01:04:20,629
(This is why choosing rooms is important.)

1836
01:04:23,169 --> 01:04:24,229
Don't tell me...

1837
01:04:24,330 --> 01:04:25,770
I'm being sincere. Really.

1838
01:04:25,770 --> 01:04:27,069
- You should... - I'm being honest.

1839
01:04:27,240 --> 01:04:29,609
Jae Seok, we're doing good so far.

1840
01:04:30,209 --> 01:04:31,240
What is this?

1841
01:04:31,240 --> 01:04:33,580
(A quest has been discovered.)

1842
01:04:33,580 --> 01:04:34,850
Gosh, seriously.

1843
01:04:35,410 --> 01:04:37,350
You can raise your level...

1844
01:04:37,350 --> 01:04:39,120
by revealing your clan's secret.

1845
01:04:39,120 --> 01:04:40,250
Will you choose to do so?

1846
01:04:41,080 --> 01:04:43,149
I can't believe he can still call himself human.

1847
01:04:43,149 --> 01:04:44,250
(He's very disappointed.)

1848
01:04:44,589 --> 01:04:45,819
How could he choose to do this?

1849
01:04:45,819 --> 01:04:48,990
(He doesn't know about the honey rice cake.)

1850
01:04:48,990 --> 01:04:50,330
I should've just revealed his secret.

1851
01:04:50,330 --> 01:04:51,729
Why did I do that?

1852
01:04:51,729 --> 01:04:54,299
(Why did I choose to keep that secret?)

1853
01:04:54,529 --> 01:04:55,700
I'll reveal his secret.

1854
01:04:55,700 --> 01:04:57,370
(I don't trust him anymore.)

1855
01:04:57,870 --> 01:04:59,569
(Jae Seok gained a level by revealing Haha's secret.)

1856
01:04:59,569 --> 01:05:01,509
(What question did Haha receive?)

1857
01:05:01,970 --> 01:05:05,740
(The final quest has been discovered.)

1858
01:05:05,740 --> 01:05:08,049
This is the last mission...

1859
01:05:08,049 --> 01:05:09,350
to keep your clan member's secret.

1860
01:05:09,350 --> 01:05:10,750
- There's your name. - Yes, it is.

1861
01:05:11,680 --> 01:05:14,080
- Is there still a chance? - Yes.

1862
01:05:14,080 --> 01:05:15,890
- Okay. - Wait. Didn't you choose betrayal?

1863
01:05:16,089 --> 01:05:17,490
Did I just say that I chose betrayal?

1864
01:05:17,790 --> 01:05:18,790
(Staring)

1865
01:05:18,790 --> 01:05:20,259
Jae Seok is smiling.

1866
01:05:20,959 --> 01:05:22,430
I think he kept his level.

1867
01:05:22,430 --> 01:05:23,589
Did you choose...

1868
01:05:23,589 --> 01:05:24,660
to keep your level?

1869
01:05:24,899 --> 01:05:25,899
He gained a level.

1870
01:05:26,129 --> 01:05:27,200
Did he gain a level?

1871
01:05:27,200 --> 01:05:28,470
Gosh, seriously.

1872
01:05:28,770 --> 01:05:31,169
He was blaming Haha so much earlier.

1873
01:05:31,370 --> 01:05:33,839
- Did you gain a level? - Wow, really?

1874
01:05:33,839 --> 01:05:34,870
(It's a turn of events.)

1875
01:05:34,870 --> 01:05:37,640
Gosh, this is why I'm naive.

1876
01:05:37,640 --> 01:05:38,779
- Then what about you? - Okay.

1877
01:05:38,839 --> 01:05:41,140
Because of Haha's choice,

1878
01:05:41,140 --> 01:05:43,310
Jae Seok lost a level.

1879
01:05:43,450 --> 01:05:44,850
- What? Why? - What is this?

1880
01:05:44,979 --> 01:05:46,149
Did he lose a level?

1881
01:05:46,149 --> 01:05:47,580
Haha, please...

1882
01:05:47,649 --> 01:05:49,149
- Haha, please change his badge. - What?

1883
01:05:49,220 --> 01:05:51,259
- Can you lose your level? - How does that work?

1884
01:05:51,390 --> 01:05:53,520
- Is it the secret? - Is it something about his choice?

1885
01:05:54,490 --> 01:05:55,790
(What happened?)

1886
01:05:55,790 --> 01:05:56,890
What is it?

1887
01:05:57,629 --> 01:06:00,729
(Haha entered the secret room before the final quest.)

1888
01:06:02,399 --> 01:06:04,700
(You can steal a level away from your clan member.)

1889
01:06:04,700 --> 01:06:06,669
(Will you challenge to this?)

1890
01:06:06,870 --> 01:06:08,339
Why do I need to think about this?

1891
01:06:10,310 --> 01:06:11,410
Of course,

1892
01:06:11,879 --> 01:06:13,140
I'll take away his level.

1893
01:06:13,709 --> 01:06:14,810
I'll keep doing so.

1894
01:06:14,879 --> 01:06:17,680
Congratulations. You gained another level.

1895
01:06:18,950 --> 01:06:20,520
Thank you. Let me transform.

1896
01:06:22,620 --> 01:06:23,750
Let me transform.

1897
01:06:24,319 --> 01:06:27,859
(Haha becomes Level 3 by taking away a level from Jae Seok.)

1898
01:06:27,859 --> 01:06:30,160
(Haha has had full control over Jae Seok's level.)

1899
01:06:30,160 --> 01:06:31,189
To be honest,

1900
01:06:31,189 --> 01:06:32,600
I didn't hesitate even a bit.

1901
01:06:33,200 --> 01:06:35,529
You won all day and chose betrayal, but you're still Level One?

1902
01:06:35,529 --> 01:06:36,830
(This is unbelievable.)

1903
01:06:36,870 --> 01:06:37,970
That's the worst.

1904
01:06:37,970 --> 01:06:40,240
You have no right to say anything. You betrayed me too.

1905
01:06:40,240 --> 01:06:42,109
- Haha has returned! - No.

1906
01:06:42,109 --> 01:06:43,609
- We're loyal to each other. - However,

1907
01:06:43,740 --> 01:06:45,209
there is one last chance...

1908
01:06:45,209 --> 01:06:47,439
to keep your secrets.

1909
01:06:47,439 --> 01:06:49,250
- I'm keeping my secret, right? - Yes.

1910
01:06:50,149 --> 01:06:53,319
A last chance will be given for those who have been revealed.

1911
01:06:53,319 --> 01:06:54,379
- Okay. - Okay.

1912
01:06:54,379 --> 01:06:56,250
This is your last chance. This is...

1913
01:06:56,490 --> 01:06:59,059
(What is today's last quest?)

1914
01:07:01,059 --> 01:07:03,429
(Shoe Free Throw)

1915
01:07:04,429 --> 01:07:06,130
Among the nine areas on the target,

1916
01:07:06,130 --> 01:07:09,229
the names of betrayed members are written on notes,

1917
01:07:09,229 --> 01:07:10,969
and minus budgets are with them.

1918
01:07:11,340 --> 01:07:13,639
You can gain your secret if you hit the area with your name,

1919
01:07:13,740 --> 01:07:15,340
which enables you to keep your secret.

1920
01:07:15,809 --> 01:07:17,340
If you hit an area with the minus budget,

1921
01:07:17,340 --> 01:07:19,179
you lose that much from your mission budget.

1922
01:07:19,779 --> 01:07:21,779
If you hit an area with someone else's name,

1923
01:07:21,779 --> 01:07:23,950
you may negotiate with the secret's owner.

1924
01:07:25,080 --> 01:07:26,979
If you fail to gain your secret by the end of the game,

1925
01:07:26,979 --> 01:07:29,450
your secret will be revealed after the game.

1926
01:07:30,719 --> 01:07:32,120
- A negotiation? - What negotiation?

1927
01:07:32,290 --> 01:07:33,689
You can put up secrets for sale.

1928
01:07:33,760 --> 01:07:34,790
- For money? - Yes.

1929
01:07:35,729 --> 01:07:36,929
Hey, the target is big.

1930
01:07:36,929 --> 01:07:38,099
What? Minus 30 dollars?

1931
01:07:38,099 --> 01:07:39,830
Hey, that's too much of a penalty.

1932
01:07:40,000 --> 01:07:41,160
Okay, Kwang Soo.

1933
01:07:41,700 --> 01:07:43,130
Let's go for minus 50 dollars.

1934
01:07:43,130 --> 01:07:44,170
The giraffe in love.

1935
01:07:44,170 --> 01:07:48,040
(She's trying to bother him.)

1936
01:07:48,439 --> 01:07:49,609
Kwang Soo likes that.

1937
01:07:50,040 --> 01:07:51,340
The lover. He's so lovely.

1938
01:07:51,380 --> 01:07:54,510
- I think the lover will do well. - I know, right?

1939
01:07:54,510 --> 01:07:55,809
He's so lovely.

1940
01:07:55,979 --> 01:07:57,279
You can do everything if you have love.

1941
01:07:57,910 --> 01:07:59,880
(You can do everything if you have love.)

1942
01:07:59,880 --> 01:08:00,950
I can't do it.

1943
01:08:00,950 --> 01:08:02,790
(I can't do it.)

1944
01:08:02,790 --> 01:08:04,620
- Okay, we won't do it. - Okay, we won't do it.

1945
01:08:05,219 --> 01:08:07,889
I think he might hit us.

1946
01:08:08,160 --> 01:08:09,229
Okay.

1947
01:08:09,389 --> 01:08:10,460
Let's go.

1948
01:08:10,460 --> 01:08:11,760
(He pulls himself together.)

1949
01:08:11,960 --> 01:08:14,769
(Singing)

1950
01:08:14,769 --> 01:08:15,969
I love you

1951
01:08:16,099 --> 01:08:17,429
I love you

1952
01:08:17,729 --> 01:08:19,670
- Where are you? I'm home - I'm home

1953
01:08:20,170 --> 01:08:21,910
- If you're not busy - Come out

1954
01:08:22,340 --> 01:08:24,139
(I can't take it anymore.)

1955
01:08:24,240 --> 01:08:25,309
Your house

1956
01:08:25,309 --> 01:08:29,380
(The giraffe shoots his front hoof.)

1957
01:08:30,210 --> 01:08:31,719
- That was twice. - I still have another chance.

1958
01:08:31,719 --> 01:08:33,179
- You missed. - I still have another chance.

1959
01:08:33,179 --> 01:08:34,380
You still missed this time.

1960
01:08:34,380 --> 01:08:35,819
(The giraffe is angry.)

1961
01:08:37,750 --> 01:08:39,019
He's so passionate.

1962
01:08:39,120 --> 01:08:40,260
- He's so cool. - He's great.

1963
01:08:40,260 --> 01:08:42,260
- Lively lively - Lively lively

1964
01:08:42,359 --> 01:08:44,090
He'll love forever.

1965
01:08:44,330 --> 01:08:45,960
- Lively lively - He'll love forever.

1966
01:08:45,960 --> 01:08:47,200
- Lively lively - Lively lively

1967
01:08:47,500 --> 01:08:48,670
(Kwang Soo throws his show.)

1968
01:08:48,670 --> 01:08:49,700
You did it. It's Haha.

1969
01:08:49,700 --> 01:08:51,000
(Kwang Soo throws his show.)

1970
01:08:51,000 --> 01:08:53,300
(What is the result?)

1971
01:08:54,599 --> 01:08:55,609
- Hold on. - What is this?

1972
01:08:55,639 --> 01:08:56,670
- What is this? - This should be done again.

1973
01:08:56,870 --> 01:08:59,080
(He threw it,)

1974
01:08:59,080 --> 01:09:00,939
(but it landed on top of the box.)

1975
01:09:00,939 --> 01:09:02,050
This should be done again.

1976
01:09:02,050 --> 01:09:03,510
He always does that.

1977
01:09:03,679 --> 01:09:05,080
He always does that.

1978
01:09:05,179 --> 01:09:07,149
- Do it again. - Why do you always do this?

1979
01:09:07,349 --> 01:09:08,750
How can this happen?

1980
01:09:08,819 --> 01:09:10,819
- Is this even possible? - Kwang Soo really is...

1981
01:09:10,920 --> 01:09:13,359
What should we do now? I think this...

1982
01:09:13,420 --> 01:09:14,719
I think this calls for another chance.

1983
01:09:14,889 --> 01:09:16,260
This is the power...

1984
01:09:16,260 --> 01:09:17,389
- of love. - Of love.

1985
01:09:17,729 --> 01:09:19,859
(He's embarrassed.)

1986
01:09:20,029 --> 01:09:21,670
It makes the impossible possible.

1987
01:09:21,670 --> 01:09:23,130
(Love makes the impossible possible.)

1988
01:09:23,870 --> 01:09:26,240
(He uses the power to try once more.)

1989
01:09:26,340 --> 01:09:28,910
(Love doesn't falter under any difficulties.)

1990
01:09:28,910 --> 01:09:31,040
(Love never dies.)

1991
01:09:31,040 --> 01:09:33,779
(The love giraffe died.)

1992
01:09:34,679 --> 01:09:37,550
- Okay! - That was clean.

1993
01:09:37,880 --> 01:09:38,920
Haha's block will be difficult.

1994
01:09:38,920 --> 01:09:39,950
Haha.

1995
01:09:41,250 --> 01:09:42,319
Here I go.

1996
01:09:42,319 --> 01:09:43,620
(It's Haha's turn.)

1997
01:09:43,750 --> 01:09:47,620
(A father of three children shows the power of love.)

1998
01:09:48,019 --> 01:09:49,729
30 dollars. Minus 30 dollars.

1999
01:09:51,090 --> 01:09:52,200
Take it slow.

2000
01:09:52,660 --> 01:09:54,559
- Hold on. - It went in cleanly.

2001
01:09:54,559 --> 01:09:56,330
There is no doubt he got minus 30 dollars.

2002
01:09:57,830 --> 01:09:59,139
- Here I go. - All right.

2003
01:09:59,569 --> 01:10:00,569
Please.

2004
01:10:00,700 --> 01:10:01,769
What?

2005
01:10:01,769 --> 01:10:03,040
(I hope my clan member does well.)

2006
01:10:03,870 --> 01:10:05,139
- What? - Minus 30 dollars.

2007
01:10:05,139 --> 01:10:06,309
(It's minus 30 dollars again.)

2008
01:10:06,309 --> 01:10:07,439
Look at her facial expression.

2009
01:10:07,439 --> 01:10:08,550
(That's too bad.)

2010
01:10:08,550 --> 01:10:11,149
Ji Hyo is really annoyed.

2011
01:10:13,149 --> 01:10:14,380
So Min.

2012
01:10:14,849 --> 01:10:16,849
- No pressure, So Min. - So Min.

2013
01:10:16,849 --> 01:10:18,319
Okay, So Min.

2014
01:10:19,219 --> 01:10:20,260
She got it.

2015
01:10:20,760 --> 01:10:22,260
(So Min kicks off her shoe.)

2016
01:10:22,590 --> 01:10:24,429
(The shoe goes into Haha's block.)

2017
01:10:25,200 --> 01:10:27,300
(She obtains Haha's secret.)

2018
01:10:28,429 --> 01:10:29,469
(She has my secret!)

2019
01:10:29,469 --> 01:10:30,529
Wow, 60 dollars.

2020
01:10:31,029 --> 01:10:32,200
- 60 dollars? - Yes, buy it.

2021
01:10:32,200 --> 01:10:34,939
- Give me the secret. - So Min, get a lot of money.

2022
01:10:34,939 --> 01:10:36,809
Get a lot of money. You should get a lot of money.

2023
01:10:36,809 --> 01:10:38,240
- 43 dollars. - 40 dollars.

2024
01:10:38,240 --> 01:10:39,309
Okay. 40 dollars.

2025
01:10:39,309 --> 01:10:40,580
- Thank you. Thank you. - Okay.

2026
01:10:40,580 --> 01:10:41,849
For goodness' sake.

2027
01:10:41,849 --> 01:10:43,050
- It's too expensive. - You are cool, Haha.

2028
01:10:43,050 --> 01:10:44,080
I am set.

2029
01:10:44,080 --> 01:10:45,479
- I am jealous of him. - Now that So Min is...

2030
01:10:45,479 --> 01:10:46,950
my clan member,

2031
01:10:47,219 --> 01:10:49,090
she is doing so well.

2032
01:10:50,719 --> 01:10:52,889
It seems like Jong Kook feels bad for So Min.

2033
01:10:53,620 --> 01:10:55,790
- It's not like that. - He never says such things.

2034
01:10:55,790 --> 01:10:57,389
So Min is nice.

2035
01:10:57,389 --> 01:10:58,760
- Kook. - I was mistaken about her.

2036
01:10:58,760 --> 01:10:59,760
- Kook. - Min.

2037
01:10:59,760 --> 01:11:00,830
- Siblings! - Siblings!

2038
01:11:00,830 --> 01:11:03,630
(Kook and Min siblings)

2039
01:11:04,200 --> 01:11:05,399
Kook and Min siblings?

2040
01:11:05,700 --> 01:11:07,040
- My goodness. - That's lovely.

2041
01:11:07,439 --> 01:11:08,840
They are close.

2042
01:11:08,840 --> 01:11:10,510
They became close.

2043
01:11:11,109 --> 01:11:12,809
- It needs to go into my block. - I'm so happy.

2044
01:11:12,939 --> 01:11:13,979
Here I go.

2045
01:11:14,040 --> 01:11:15,149
Get minus 50 dollars.

2046
01:11:15,149 --> 01:11:16,450
It will be hilarious.

2047
01:11:16,450 --> 01:11:18,219
- Seok Jin, get minus 50 dollars. - There you go.

2048
01:11:18,219 --> 01:11:19,279
He got it.

2049
01:11:20,550 --> 01:11:23,719
(Where will his shoe fall?)

2050
01:11:24,090 --> 01:11:25,090
Jeon So Min!

2051
01:11:25,090 --> 01:11:26,490
(He gets So Min's secret.)

2052
01:11:26,490 --> 01:11:27,559
What am I going to do?

2053
01:11:27,760 --> 01:11:28,760
What?

2054
01:11:28,760 --> 01:11:29,929
- Jeon So Min! - It's a good thing.

2055
01:11:29,929 --> 01:11:31,090
It's nothing.

2056
01:11:31,960 --> 01:11:33,729
I will reveal my secret.

2057
01:11:33,729 --> 01:11:36,969
(She refuses to negotiate.)

2058
01:11:37,069 --> 01:11:39,170
(Freezing)

2059
01:11:39,170 --> 01:11:40,340
- Don't do that. - I will reveal...

2060
01:11:40,870 --> 01:11:42,639
I will reveal my secret.

2061
01:11:42,639 --> 01:11:43,969
Don't do that.

2062
01:11:44,309 --> 01:11:45,410
So Min.

2063
01:11:45,410 --> 01:11:46,410
(Heartbroken)

2064
01:11:46,410 --> 01:11:47,679
- Get 10 dollars if you can. - How about...

2065
01:11:47,679 --> 01:11:50,050
- How about five dollars? - I will reveal...

2066
01:11:50,050 --> 01:11:51,380
my secret.

2067
01:11:51,380 --> 01:11:53,620
- So Min is cool. - I know.

2068
01:11:54,120 --> 01:11:57,090
(4 members' secrets will be revealed.)

2069
01:11:57,420 --> 01:11:59,219
Please reveal your secret.

2070
01:11:59,219 --> 01:12:00,990
(Who will reveal a secret first?)

2071
01:12:00,990 --> 01:12:01,990
(Ji Hyo)

2072
01:12:01,990 --> 01:12:03,130
In 1, 2, 3.

2073
01:12:03,290 --> 01:12:04,559
Yang Se Chan!

2074
01:12:04,559 --> 01:12:06,330
(Yang Se Chan!)

2075
01:12:06,399 --> 01:12:08,330
I might make you take a vacation for about three months.

2076
01:12:09,429 --> 01:12:12,139
(Will her acting career end once the secret is revealed?)

2077
01:12:12,370 --> 01:12:15,170
(What could be her deadly secret?)

2078
01:12:15,170 --> 01:12:16,170
I am sorry, Ji Hyo.

2079
01:12:16,170 --> 01:12:17,510
(What kind of secret was Ji Hyo hiding?)

2080
01:12:17,510 --> 01:12:19,740
Yang Se Chan!

2081
01:12:21,279 --> 01:12:23,080
- What? - "I have seen Song Ji Hyo..."

2082
01:12:23,080 --> 01:12:25,250
"go without a shower for a week when she had no schedule."

2083
01:12:25,250 --> 01:12:26,550
My goodness.

2084
01:12:26,550 --> 01:12:28,950
It's a tip-off I got from someone who knows her well.

2085
01:12:28,950 --> 01:12:30,319
- Really? - For a week?

2086
01:12:30,319 --> 01:12:31,960
She went a week without a shower.

2087
01:12:31,960 --> 01:12:33,689
Apparently, that person didn't even see her brush her teeth.

2088
01:12:33,689 --> 01:12:35,590
- A week? - A week?

2089
01:12:35,590 --> 01:12:37,359
Did you go a week without brushing your teeth?

2090
01:12:37,359 --> 01:12:39,330
Doesn't that make her Robinson Crusoe?

2091
01:12:39,330 --> 01:12:42,330
(Doesn't that make her Robinson Crusoe?)

2092
01:12:44,929 --> 01:12:46,969
(She could be a castaway in her next movie.)

2093
01:12:47,040 --> 01:12:49,170
Jeon So Min. In 1, 2, 3.

2094
01:12:50,740 --> 01:12:53,510
(What's So Min's secret?)

2095
01:12:53,510 --> 01:12:54,740
"I have heard So Min ask Kwang Soo..."

2096
01:12:54,740 --> 01:12:56,479
"to introduce her to a man."

2097
01:12:56,479 --> 01:12:57,710
When did I do that?

2098
01:12:57,809 --> 01:12:59,319
That man is...

2099
01:12:59,479 --> 01:13:01,550
- Is he someone we know? - He is a celebrity.

2100
01:13:01,550 --> 01:13:02,920
(What's important is that the man is a celebrity.)

2101
01:13:03,719 --> 01:13:05,319
It's not just any man.

2102
01:13:05,319 --> 01:13:06,590
There is someone she wants.

2103
01:13:06,590 --> 01:13:08,389
- I see. - It's a big secret.

2104
01:13:08,389 --> 01:13:09,460
It's a big secret.

2105
01:13:09,460 --> 01:13:11,800
That man must be someone Kwang Soo is close to.

2106
01:13:11,800 --> 01:13:14,700
(Is he a celebrity Kwang Soo is close to?)

2107
01:13:14,830 --> 01:13:17,769
(Where did he hear this?)

2108
01:13:18,229 --> 01:13:20,139
Who is he? I want to know.

2109
01:13:20,139 --> 01:13:21,399
Why won't you introduce her to him?

2110
01:13:21,399 --> 01:13:22,670
(Why won't Kwang Soo introduce her to him?)

2111
01:13:22,670 --> 01:13:24,670
I asked him, but...

2112
01:13:24,670 --> 01:13:26,979
(He doesn't finish his sentence.)

2113
01:13:26,979 --> 01:13:28,609
- He... - Did he refuse?

2114
01:13:29,410 --> 01:13:30,649
You did ask him.

2115
01:13:30,649 --> 01:13:31,750
I mean...

2116
01:13:31,750 --> 01:13:33,050
(I didn't want to lose a friend.)

2117
01:13:33,050 --> 01:13:34,319
I see.

2118
01:13:34,319 --> 01:13:36,019
Did he tell you he doesn't want that?

2119
01:13:36,019 --> 01:13:37,490
I should have known.

2120
01:13:37,490 --> 01:13:39,719
Kwang Soo didn't say a thing even after 3 or 4 months.

2121
01:13:39,719 --> 01:13:41,160
He didn't want to hurt your feelings.

2122
01:13:41,160 --> 01:13:42,960
That man turned her down.

2123
01:13:43,029 --> 01:13:45,059
It's not like that. He was busy.

2124
01:13:45,059 --> 01:13:46,460
- Go ahead and think that. - He was busy.

2125
01:13:46,460 --> 01:13:50,099
She asked Kwang Soo to introduce her to a celebrity,

2126
01:13:50,099 --> 01:13:51,170
but he...

2127
01:13:51,170 --> 01:13:53,840
(He doesn't finish the sentence.)

2128
01:13:53,840 --> 01:13:55,040
- The next secret... - Both of us were busy.

2129
01:13:55,040 --> 01:13:56,840
belongs to Seok Jin.

2130
01:13:57,410 --> 01:13:58,410
What's...

2131
01:13:58,410 --> 01:13:59,540
(It's time to reveal Seok Jin's secret.)

2132
01:13:59,540 --> 01:14:01,210
Does Seok Jin even have a secret?

2133
01:14:01,580 --> 01:14:03,809
You said I will seem cool if this secret gets revealed.

2134
01:14:04,109 --> 01:14:05,950
- Really? - That's because...

2135
01:14:06,519 --> 01:14:07,620
- You will seem cool. - Okay.

2136
01:14:07,620 --> 01:14:09,019
Seok Jin. In 1, 2, 3.

2137
01:14:09,019 --> 01:14:10,149
It's nothing bad.

2138
01:14:10,149 --> 01:14:12,219
(Will Seok Jin seem cool once the secret gets revealed?)

2139
01:14:12,219 --> 01:14:13,260
In 1, 2, 3.

2140
01:14:13,620 --> 01:14:15,290
(What is Seok Jin's cool secret?)

2141
01:14:15,290 --> 01:14:17,460
(Jee Seok Jin)

2142
01:14:17,460 --> 01:14:19,559
"Jee Seok Jin has a bank account his wife doesn't know about."

2143
01:14:19,559 --> 01:14:21,729
(It's a secret bank account.)

2144
01:14:21,729 --> 01:14:23,670
"Jee Seok Jin has a bank account his wife doesn't know about."

2145
01:14:23,670 --> 01:14:24,670
It's true.

2146
01:14:24,899 --> 01:14:25,899
It's true!

2147
01:14:26,469 --> 01:14:27,769
Don't let your wife watch this episode.

2148
01:14:27,769 --> 01:14:29,840
- Hey! - It has been a year and a half.

2149
01:14:29,840 --> 01:14:30,969
A year and a half ago,

2150
01:14:30,969 --> 01:14:33,040
Seok Jin made a secret bank account and told me about it.

2151
01:14:33,040 --> 01:14:34,139
(Seok Jin's wife will begin her search soon.)

2152
01:14:34,139 --> 01:14:36,010
He went too far.

2153
01:14:36,510 --> 01:14:39,179
I treated you to meals with that money.

2154
01:14:39,179 --> 01:14:41,479
(How could you betray me like this?)

2155
01:14:41,920 --> 01:14:43,490
- Do you know that? - Seriously?

2156
01:14:44,120 --> 01:14:45,490
Seok Jin's wife will be mad...

2157
01:14:45,490 --> 01:14:47,859
- when she finds out. - It's been a year and a half.

2158
01:14:47,859 --> 01:14:49,290
What is he going to do?

2159
01:14:49,590 --> 01:14:51,429
This one is strong.

2160
01:14:51,429 --> 01:14:52,559
(Seok Jin's life is hanging by a thread.)

2161
01:14:52,559 --> 01:14:56,029
Seok Jin's secret has been revealed.

2162
01:14:56,370 --> 01:14:57,429
(Lee Kwang Soo)

2163
01:14:57,429 --> 01:14:58,569
Kwang Soo.

2164
01:14:58,569 --> 01:14:59,569
This is...

2165
01:14:59,569 --> 01:15:00,939
I am curious.

2166
01:15:00,939 --> 01:15:02,410
(What did Seok Jin reveal about Kwang Soo?)

2167
01:15:02,410 --> 01:15:04,370
You will see how manly Kwang Soo is.

2168
01:15:04,370 --> 01:15:07,139
I did this for him.

2169
01:15:07,139 --> 01:15:08,340
Kwang Soo.

2170
01:15:08,340 --> 01:15:09,410
- I did this for him. - Manly?

2171
01:15:09,750 --> 01:15:10,849
What about me?

2172
01:15:10,849 --> 01:15:12,120
(What about me?)

2173
01:15:12,120 --> 01:15:13,450
How manly I am?

2174
01:15:13,450 --> 01:15:15,019
(How manly I am?)

2175
01:15:16,750 --> 01:15:19,960
It hit me hard.

2176
01:15:19,960 --> 01:15:21,889
(Seok Jin was shocked that day.)

2177
01:15:22,229 --> 01:15:24,229
(That day, Kwang Soo's manliness exploded...)

2178
01:15:24,229 --> 01:15:28,130
(and something happened.)

2179
01:15:28,130 --> 01:15:29,670
(Lee Kwang Soo)

2180
01:15:29,670 --> 01:15:31,399
- Kwang Soo. - This is the last one.

2181
01:15:31,399 --> 01:15:33,439
- He is a man. - In 1, 2, 3.

2182
01:15:33,439 --> 01:15:35,670
(It's a secret that has never been revealed.)

2183
01:15:35,910 --> 01:15:39,779
(What is the secret that will show Kwang Soo's manliness?)

2184
01:15:39,779 --> 01:15:40,840
Show us.

2185
01:15:41,540 --> 01:15:44,349
"Lee Kwang Soo said he can beat Kim Jong Kook in a fight."

2186
01:15:44,349 --> 01:15:45,349
What...

2187
01:15:46,179 --> 01:15:49,090
(Kwang Soo's secret)

2188
01:15:49,090 --> 01:15:50,189
(I see.)

2189
01:15:50,189 --> 01:15:51,620
He said it in a drunken state.

2190
01:15:51,620 --> 01:15:52,660
Really?

2191
01:15:52,660 --> 01:15:53,660
(No way.)

2192
01:15:53,660 --> 01:15:55,590
(How could he say that?)

2193
01:15:55,590 --> 01:15:58,389
(What are you talking about?)

2194
01:15:58,529 --> 01:16:00,760
(This is the first time Kwang Soo is hearing about it.)

2195
01:16:00,760 --> 01:16:01,870
I get it.

2196
01:16:02,130 --> 01:16:04,370
He said he went easy on you all these years.

2197
01:16:05,569 --> 01:16:07,200
- Did he mean it? - What are you talking about?

2198
01:16:07,200 --> 01:16:09,170
In his drunken state, he said, "You know I go easy on Jong Kook,"

2199
01:16:09,170 --> 01:16:10,269
"right?"

2200
01:16:10,269 --> 01:16:11,410
What...

2201
01:16:11,469 --> 01:16:13,309
- "If I put my mind to it..." - What are you talking about?

2202
01:16:13,309 --> 01:16:14,740
Didn't we hear something similar?

2203
01:16:14,740 --> 01:16:16,050
- "If I put my mind to it," - What are you talking about?

2204
01:16:16,050 --> 01:16:17,250
"Jong Kook can't win against me."

2205
01:16:17,250 --> 01:16:18,250
Okay. Come on out.

2206
01:16:18,250 --> 01:16:20,349
(I heard enough.)

2207
01:16:20,349 --> 01:16:21,420
It's not like that.

2208
01:16:21,420 --> 01:16:22,620
Come on out?

2209
01:16:22,620 --> 01:16:23,649
- Come on out. - What are you talking about?

2210
01:16:23,649 --> 01:16:25,149
I must have been wasted!

2211
01:16:25,819 --> 01:16:27,260
It makes no sense!

2212
01:16:27,260 --> 01:16:28,290
(Please forgive me.)

2213
01:16:28,490 --> 01:16:30,290
(This is why you must watch your tongue.)

2214
01:16:31,330 --> 01:16:32,529
(It's dangerous to have a secret.)

2215
01:16:32,529 --> 01:16:34,229
- Okay. - There is no way I said it!

2216
01:16:34,229 --> 01:16:35,670
- Okay. - There is no way I said it!

2217
01:16:35,670 --> 01:16:37,099
(Keep your friend's secret to the grave.)

2218
01:16:37,099 --> 01:16:38,269
- Come on out. - No.

2219
01:16:38,740 --> 01:16:40,170
May I film it?

2220
01:16:40,170 --> 01:16:41,540
(He wants to live stream the fight.)

2221
01:16:41,540 --> 01:16:42,769
What are you talking about?

2222
01:16:42,769 --> 01:16:44,109
May I film it?

2223
01:16:44,109 --> 01:16:45,679
What are you talking about?

2224
01:16:45,679 --> 01:16:46,979
- I want to record it. - Why would you film it?

2225
01:16:46,979 --> 01:16:48,309
- Go ahead. - I want to record it.

2226
01:16:48,309 --> 01:16:49,649
Why would you do that?

2227
01:16:49,649 --> 01:16:51,609
We enjoyed the four secrets.

2228
01:16:51,609 --> 01:16:53,849
- They were pretty intense. - I know.

2229
01:16:53,849 --> 01:16:56,590
I will now reveal the final results of the race.

2230
01:16:56,750 --> 01:16:59,859
A clan that protected the secrets of all clan members,

2231
01:16:59,859 --> 01:17:03,059
Clan Jae Seok and Haha will receive the prize money...

2232
01:17:03,590 --> 01:17:04,960
of 100 dollars.

2233
01:17:04,960 --> 01:17:06,760
(They win the prize money of 100 dollars.)

2234
01:17:06,760 --> 01:17:08,029
- Really? - Will you give us money?

2235
01:17:08,500 --> 01:17:09,830
That's a lot of money.

2236
01:17:09,830 --> 01:17:12,000
He bought his secret for 40 dollars and received 100 dollars.

2237
01:17:12,170 --> 01:17:14,840
- You should have asked for more. - I should have.

2238
01:17:15,340 --> 01:17:16,469
(This is incredible.)

2239
01:17:16,469 --> 01:17:17,840
We did a good job.

2240
01:17:17,840 --> 01:17:19,740
- I had no idea. - We have the best teamwork.

2241
01:17:19,740 --> 01:17:21,010
This is incredible.

2242
01:17:21,410 --> 01:17:23,010
- I can't believe it. - Now,

2243
01:17:23,279 --> 01:17:25,050
a clan that revealed the secrets of all clan members,

2244
01:17:25,050 --> 01:17:27,920
Clan Seok Jin and Kwang Soo will receive a penalty.

2245
01:17:27,920 --> 01:17:29,290
- This is incredible. - A penalty again?

2246
01:17:29,290 --> 01:17:30,450
(They always receive penalties.)

2247
01:17:30,450 --> 01:17:32,260
I will now announce the final amounts of money.

2248
01:17:33,990 --> 01:17:36,330
(1st Place: 129 dollars, 2nd Place: 124 dollars,)

2249
01:17:36,330 --> 01:17:38,460
(3rd Place: 28 dollars, 4th Place: 28 dollars)

2250
01:17:38,929 --> 01:17:41,729
Each level costs 50 dollars.

2251
01:17:41,729 --> 01:17:43,130
Jae Seok, thank you.

2252
01:17:43,130 --> 01:17:45,069
You are less than human.

2253
01:17:45,370 --> 01:17:47,000
- I bought a level. - But...

2254
01:17:47,269 --> 01:17:49,639
(Jae Seok is Level 2 and Haha is Level 4.)

2255
01:17:49,639 --> 01:17:50,740
Kwang Soo.

2256
01:17:50,840 --> 01:17:53,639
I want to buy two levels by myself.

2257
01:17:54,109 --> 01:17:55,240
So Min, go ahead!

2258
01:17:55,240 --> 01:17:56,750
(So Min, go ahead!)

2259
01:17:56,910 --> 01:17:58,380
So Min, go ahead!

2260
01:17:58,380 --> 01:17:59,819
- I am serious. - If you say that,

2261
01:17:59,819 --> 01:18:01,990
I will feel too bad.

2262
01:18:01,990 --> 01:18:04,620
It's okay. I feel bad about revealing your secret.

2263
01:18:04,620 --> 01:18:05,719
In that case...

2264
01:18:05,719 --> 01:18:07,389
It's okay because I am Level Four.

2265
01:18:07,460 --> 01:18:08,960
Suddenly, Jong Kook...

2266
01:18:08,960 --> 01:18:09,990
(Jong Kook pays her back for her loyalty.)

2267
01:18:09,990 --> 01:18:11,389
Jong Kook.

2268
01:18:11,389 --> 01:18:12,700
Then I won't refuse.

2269
01:18:12,800 --> 01:18:14,330
We are set.

2270
01:18:14,330 --> 01:18:15,370
(So Min buys 2 levels.)

2271
01:18:17,099 --> 01:18:19,240
- Thank you. - I really don't understand why...

2272
01:18:19,240 --> 01:18:20,639
I am still Level Two.

2273
01:18:20,769 --> 01:18:22,309
We have 20 dollars left.

2274
01:18:22,309 --> 01:18:23,840
- We have 20 dollars left, too. - In that case,

2275
01:18:23,840 --> 01:18:25,069
let's combine the money...

2276
01:18:25,069 --> 01:18:26,939
and buy a level for one member who wins in rock-paper-scissors.

2277
01:18:26,939 --> 01:18:28,109
- Can we do that? - Let's do that.

2278
01:18:28,240 --> 01:18:29,880
- I am for it. - Play rock-paper-scissors.

2279
01:18:30,450 --> 01:18:31,979
- Rock-paper-scissors. - Let's do it, Jong Kook.

2280
01:18:31,979 --> 01:18:34,519
- Really? - Jong Kook, you should sit out.

2281
01:18:34,519 --> 01:18:36,689
(Your level is high.)

2282
01:18:36,689 --> 01:18:38,090
- Your level... - I must participate...

2283
01:18:38,090 --> 01:18:40,189
because I want to buy a level for So Min.

2284
01:18:40,189 --> 01:18:42,760
(I want to buy a level for So Min.)

2285
01:18:42,760 --> 01:18:44,260
He is so cool.

2286
01:18:44,260 --> 01:18:45,460
I must participate.

2287
01:18:45,460 --> 01:18:47,330
Gosh, this is... Let's not do this.

2288
01:18:47,330 --> 01:18:48,399
What?

2289
01:18:48,399 --> 01:18:50,170
- Let's not do this. - What?

2290
01:18:50,170 --> 01:18:51,630
- Let's not do this. - Why?

2291
01:18:51,830 --> 01:18:53,269
You are being ridiculous.

2292
01:18:53,269 --> 01:18:54,800
You want to buy a level for her?

2293
01:18:54,800 --> 01:18:56,870
Is she your girlfriend or something?

2294
01:18:56,910 --> 01:18:58,510
For goodness' sake.

2295
01:18:59,040 --> 01:19:00,240
Are you acting up?

2296
01:19:00,340 --> 01:19:01,710
No, I am not.

2297
01:19:01,710 --> 01:19:04,410
(He is acting up by 100 percent.)

2298
01:19:04,450 --> 01:19:06,519
I must buy her a level because I feel bad.

2299
01:19:06,519 --> 01:19:08,380
- Is she your girlfriend? - I have a good idea.

2300
01:19:08,450 --> 01:19:10,750
Let's all play rock-paper-scissors and give two levels to a person.

2301
01:19:10,750 --> 01:19:11,750
That's a good idea.

2302
01:19:11,750 --> 01:19:13,460
- Let's all play it. - I am for it.

2303
01:19:13,460 --> 01:19:14,760
- Let's do this. - Okay.

2304
01:19:14,760 --> 01:19:15,929
- That sounds good. - Okay.

2305
01:19:15,929 --> 01:19:17,029
Okay.

2306
01:19:17,029 --> 01:19:18,389
- This is nerve-wracking. - No way.

2307
01:19:18,389 --> 01:19:20,460
We each have one-eighth of a chance.

2308
01:19:20,460 --> 01:19:21,660
(You succeed if you pick a note that says "2 Levels Up".)

2309
01:19:22,130 --> 01:19:23,729
This one is from the middle.

2310
01:19:24,000 --> 01:19:25,399
This one is from the top.

2311
01:19:25,399 --> 01:19:27,200
This one is from the top. I don't know which is which.

2312
01:19:28,040 --> 01:19:29,639
- Shall we take turns? - This is driving me crazy.

2313
01:19:30,069 --> 01:19:31,740
I hope this puts an end to everything.

2314
01:19:32,240 --> 01:19:33,240
In 1, 2, 3.

2315
01:19:33,240 --> 01:19:34,510
(What will be the result?)

2316
01:19:36,479 --> 01:19:38,279
(6 members fail to level up.)

2317
01:19:38,279 --> 01:19:40,779
I'm so unlucky. I have the worst luck.

2318
01:19:40,779 --> 01:19:44,689
See? Because we were nice to each other,

2319
01:19:44,689 --> 01:19:47,689
this good fortune came to us.

2320
01:19:47,790 --> 01:19:49,429
- Am I wrong, So Min? - You're right.

2321
01:19:49,429 --> 01:19:51,290
- That's how we must be. - It happened because we were nice.

2322
01:19:51,290 --> 01:19:53,300
- That's right. Look at this. - It happened because we were nice.

2323
01:19:53,300 --> 01:19:55,569
- Exactly. - Open it together. 1, 2, 3.

2324
01:19:55,700 --> 01:20:00,269
(Which member will be able to level up twice?)

2325
01:20:00,269 --> 01:20:02,410
(2 Levels Up)

2326
01:20:02,410 --> 01:20:04,870
(So Min's level goes up by 2.)

2327
01:20:04,870 --> 01:20:06,139
- Look at this. - My gosh.

2328
01:20:06,540 --> 01:20:07,939
I'm in first place.

2329
01:20:08,540 --> 01:20:12,080
(I'm jealous. She's Level 6 now.)

2330
01:20:12,679 --> 01:20:14,779
(As So Min levels up,)

2331
01:20:14,779 --> 01:20:16,990
(Jong Kook doesn't feel guilty about his secret level-up.)

2332
01:20:16,990 --> 01:20:19,689
I'm Level Six. How is that possible?

2333
01:20:20,059 --> 01:20:21,260
That makes no sense, you punk.

2334
01:20:21,260 --> 01:20:23,790
(That makes no sense, you punk.)

2335
01:20:23,790 --> 01:20:25,830
Seok Jin, what's wrong?

2336
01:20:25,830 --> 01:20:28,000
- What's wrong with you? - Why are you so mad?

2337
01:20:28,359 --> 01:20:30,300
I think you were supposed to think that in your head.

2338
01:20:30,300 --> 01:20:31,769
Why are you mad all of a sudden?

2339
01:20:31,769 --> 01:20:33,899
(So Min is in 1st place with Level 6.)

2340
01:20:34,569 --> 01:20:37,040
1, 2...

2341
01:20:38,910 --> 01:20:41,139
(This is their first penalty today.)

2342
01:20:41,139 --> 01:20:42,149
- 3. - 3.

2343
01:20:42,149 --> 01:20:45,410
(Yet, this scene seems very familiar.)

2344
01:20:45,410 --> 01:20:47,620
- Good work, everybody. - Good work, everybody.

2345
01:20:47,620 --> 01:20:49,689
- Great job. - Good work.

2346
01:20:49,990 --> 01:20:52,420
I'm sick of it. I'm so sick of it.

2347
01:20:52,420 --> 01:20:53,790
(What is their next adventure?)

2348
01:20:54,420 --> 01:20:57,359
(The Golden Days of the High Levels have arrived with the project.)

2349
01:20:57,359 --> 01:20:59,300
(It's a coup by the members with low levels.)

2350
01:20:59,300 --> 01:21:01,099
(The incident of level fabrication has occurred.)

2351
01:21:01,099 --> 01:21:04,200
(Strange suspects have come to Running Man.)

2352
01:21:04,870 --> 01:21:06,399
(Ryu Seung Ryong)

2353
01:21:06,399 --> 01:21:07,469
(Lee Ha Nee)

2354
01:21:07,469 --> 01:21:09,269
(Lee Dong Hwi, Jin Sun Kyu, and Gong Myoung)

2355
01:21:09,269 --> 01:21:11,269
(Forget about the fabricated levels for now.)

2356
01:21:11,809 --> 01:21:15,279
(They seemed a bit odd, but something is suspicious about them.)

2357
01:21:15,279 --> 01:21:18,750
(Suspicious behaviors of suspects are spotted here and there.)

2358
01:21:18,750 --> 01:21:22,050
(And they left behind clues about the forger.)

2359
01:21:22,050 --> 01:21:24,550
(A forger has outsmarted the members of Running Man.)

2360
01:21:24,550 --> 01:21:27,819
(Anyone can be a forger, and anyone can be a victim.)

2361
01:21:27,819 --> 01:21:30,790
(Who's the forger that has concealed his or herself among them?)

2362
01:21:30,827 --> 01:21:32,398
(RPG: Catch Me If You Can)
