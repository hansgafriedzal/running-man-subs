1
00:00:07,327 --> 00:00:08,565
(Last week)

2
00:00:08,566 --> 00:00:10,565
This is a project for all, Rice Cake in the Sky.

3
00:00:10,566 --> 00:00:13,232
(Grand New Year Project, the Level Up Race)

4
00:00:13,566 --> 00:00:16,434
(For 3 weeks, fierce battles have unfolded to level up.)

5
00:00:16,807 --> 00:00:19,977
(And today, the final winner will be decided.)

6
00:00:20,476 --> 00:00:23,708
(How will this long journey end?)

7
00:00:29,287 --> 00:00:31,985
Hello. Hi, hi. Hello, there.

8
00:00:31,986 --> 00:00:33,886
- Hello. - Hi.

9
00:00:33,887 --> 00:00:34,886
Hello.

10
00:00:34,887 --> 00:00:37,295
- It's very cold. - It's snowing.

11
00:00:37,296 --> 00:00:38,306
(The snow is piling up.)

12
00:00:38,626 --> 00:00:40,344
It feels great to be at a ski resort.

13
00:00:40,367 --> 00:00:43,735
By the way, did you see So Min's poem on her social media?

14
00:00:43,736 --> 00:00:45,896
(By the way, did you see So Min's poem on her social media?)

15
00:00:45,897 --> 00:00:47,106
- Hey, you know what? - She wrote a poem?

16
00:00:47,107 --> 00:00:48,536
- Is she a poet? - That's true.

17
00:00:48,537 --> 00:00:50,597
Have you been writing poems lately?

18
00:00:50,677 --> 00:00:52,936
- Those weren't lyrics? - No, I wrote them myself.

19
00:00:52,937 --> 00:00:56,038
- I was looking at snow in Sapporo. - Why did you suddenly write a poem?

20
00:00:56,077 --> 00:00:58,375
I went on a trip with my parents.

21
00:00:58,376 --> 00:01:01,073
When I was looking at my parents by myself...

22
00:01:01,187 --> 00:01:04,085
You should cherish the moment in private. Why did you post it?

23
00:01:04,086 --> 00:01:06,237
Let me read one of her poems.

24
00:01:06,886 --> 00:01:09,452
- When did you get that? - Let me read her poem.

25
00:01:10,196 --> 00:01:13,298
- I can't understand her. - Come on.

26
00:01:13,627 --> 00:01:16,296
- I just wrote a poem. - Well, this is the poem...

27
00:01:16,297 --> 00:01:18,185
- So Min posted on her social media. - Okay.

28
00:01:18,397 --> 00:01:21,435
"Even if I walk to you all day long, in Sapporo, there wouldn't be..."

29
00:01:21,436 --> 00:01:23,225
"any traces."

30
00:01:23,877 --> 00:01:26,135
- That's what she wrote? - "Even if I walk to you all night,"

31
00:01:26,136 --> 00:01:28,075
- "there would be no traces." - This is so embarrassing.

32
00:01:28,076 --> 00:01:31,176
- "If I stand still, I'll be gone." - This is so embarrassing.

33
00:01:31,177 --> 00:01:33,786
- "If I daze off, all will be gone." - What does that mean?

34
00:01:33,787 --> 00:01:35,486
- What does this mean? - What is this about?

35
00:01:35,487 --> 00:01:38,415
- What is this? - What is she saying?

36
00:01:38,416 --> 00:01:41,082
She wrote this on a piece of napkin and put it next to a cup of coffee.

37
00:01:41,356 --> 00:01:42,585
(This is a true story.)

38
00:01:42,586 --> 00:01:45,096
- She put a cup of coffee there. - You're the worst, So Min.

39
00:01:45,097 --> 00:01:47,520
- She does all sorts of things. - My goodness, unbelievable.

40
00:01:48,826 --> 00:01:49,896
My gosh, this is...

41
00:01:49,897 --> 00:01:52,765
- Could this mean... - What was the background song?

42
00:01:52,836 --> 00:01:55,433
- There was no song. - Freestyle's "Unknown Address"?

43
00:01:56,407 --> 00:02:01,605
(This post was popular on an outdated social media website.)

44
00:02:01,606 --> 00:02:03,376
- It was "Snow Flower". - "Unknown Address"?

45
00:02:03,377 --> 00:02:04,559
(No, it was "Snow Flower".)

46
00:02:04,877 --> 00:02:06,445
It was "Snow Flower".

47
00:02:06,446 --> 00:02:08,046
(Even in the heart of a poet, So Min,)

48
00:02:08,047 --> 00:02:11,685
(white snow of Sapporo has fallen.)

49
00:02:11,686 --> 00:02:13,685
"Even if I walk to you all day long, in Sapporo..."

50
00:02:13,686 --> 00:02:16,255
(Sighing)

51
00:02:16,256 --> 00:02:20,796
(I am lonely like Sapporo.)

52
00:02:20,797 --> 00:02:25,065
(She was walking with heavy steps.)

53
00:02:25,066 --> 00:02:27,632
(She disappeared out of the frame.)

54
00:02:28,566 --> 00:02:31,676
(So Min and the snow are the same. She decides to disappear.)

55
00:02:31,677 --> 00:02:34,475
(Too much emotions can make you cringe.)

56
00:02:34,776 --> 00:02:36,464
(Playlist in Sapporo, "Snow Flower" by Park Hyo Shin)

57
00:02:36,617 --> 00:02:40,486
(Her sentiment in Sapporo brought upon a tragedy on a wintry day.)

58
00:02:40,487 --> 00:02:42,585
Hey, she must have written that for someone.

59
00:02:42,586 --> 00:02:44,315
- No, no. - What's wrong with you, So Min?

60
00:02:44,316 --> 00:02:46,486
- No, I was... - She wrote it for someone.

61
00:02:46,487 --> 00:02:47,986
That was definitely meant for someone.

62
00:02:47,987 --> 00:02:50,178
- That has to be the case. - She must have someone. Look.

63
00:02:50,327 --> 00:02:52,796
You know what? With that point of view,

64
00:02:52,797 --> 00:02:54,465
- this poem is very meaningful. - Yes.

65
00:02:54,466 --> 00:02:56,736
"Even if I walk to you all day long, in Sapporo,"

66
00:02:56,737 --> 00:02:58,065
"there wouldn't be any traces."

67
00:02:58,066 --> 00:02:59,565
- It snowed a lot. - "To you".

68
00:02:59,566 --> 00:03:02,305
- That makes sense. We can trace it. - Exactly.

69
00:03:02,306 --> 00:03:04,335
Last time, So Min asked me to set her up with a guy,

70
00:03:04,336 --> 00:03:06,505
and I heard back from him.

71
00:03:06,506 --> 00:03:08,466
- He did? - He asked if it was meant for him.

72
00:03:08,677 --> 00:03:10,837
- What did you tell him? - I said that it was for him.

73
00:03:10,977 --> 00:03:14,345
"Okay, I see." I said that it was for him.

74
00:03:14,346 --> 00:03:16,468
(He sounds cold-hearted.)

75
00:03:16,816 --> 00:03:17,815
He's younger than you.

76
00:03:17,816 --> 00:03:20,210
- Hey. - "Have a nice meal, Kwang Soo."

77
00:03:20,487 --> 00:03:22,726
- My gosh. - "Have a nice meal, Kwang Soo."

78
00:03:22,727 --> 00:03:23,896
I see.

79
00:03:23,897 --> 00:03:25,155
(I'll set you up next time.)

80
00:03:25,156 --> 00:03:27,896
- You put on your level badges. - Yes.

81
00:03:27,897 --> 00:03:30,065
By the way, don't you think this is too cruel?

82
00:03:30,066 --> 00:03:32,065
- They're both 0. Level 0. - Listen.

83
00:03:32,066 --> 00:03:34,305
- You're Level Zero now. - I won the games last week.

84
00:03:34,306 --> 00:03:36,606
- You have nothing. - I was in the lead by myself.

85
00:03:36,607 --> 00:03:39,136
- He practices non-possession. - This is so mean.

86
00:03:39,137 --> 00:03:41,275
- You're Level 6. - She's Level 6. Seriously?

87
00:03:41,276 --> 00:03:42,946
- What's your level? - Look at Haha's level too.

88
00:03:42,947 --> 00:03:43,976
You're unbelievable, Haha.

89
00:03:43,977 --> 00:03:46,370
- I'm Level Six. - He took Jae Seok's levels.

90
00:03:52,887 --> 00:03:56,595
Today is the final episode of 2019 New Year Project,

91
00:03:56,596 --> 00:03:58,396
- the Level Up Race. - Final episode.

92
00:03:58,397 --> 00:04:01,527
Level 10 Member: Catch-up Partner.

93
00:04:02,096 --> 00:04:03,784
- Partner? - There are partners.

94
00:04:04,336 --> 00:04:05,796
(This is a couple race.)

95
00:04:05,797 --> 00:04:06,846
It's a race with partners.

96
00:04:07,466 --> 00:04:08,505
We'll have partners.

97
00:04:08,506 --> 00:04:11,435
Inside are the partners who will decide your fates.

98
00:04:11,436 --> 00:04:13,076
- Are they inside? - Partners?

99
00:04:13,077 --> 00:04:14,976
Six of your partners are waiting in there.

100
00:04:14,977 --> 00:04:17,315
- Really? - There are six partners.

101
00:04:17,316 --> 00:04:18,976
- You'll go meet them now. - Let's go.

102
00:04:18,977 --> 00:04:20,786
(Let's go!)

103
00:04:20,787 --> 00:04:23,716
- Let's go. - He's running.

104
00:04:23,717 --> 00:04:24,827
(What kind of partners await them?)

105
00:04:25,117 --> 00:04:26,156
(It's time to reveal the partners.)

106
00:04:26,157 --> 00:04:27,601
Come on. Give me a chance.

107
00:04:27,857 --> 00:04:29,726
- I really wish I get a good one. - Same here.

108
00:04:29,727 --> 00:04:31,069
I'll catch up. I'm serious.

109
00:04:31,157 --> 00:04:32,672
Right now, the guests are...

110
00:04:33,157 --> 00:04:34,895
waiting behind the doors.

111
00:04:34,896 --> 00:04:35,926
Is that so?

112
00:04:35,927 --> 00:04:37,451
(The 6 Catch-up Partners are waiting behind the doors.)

113
00:04:37,967 --> 00:04:40,026
On the doors that the guests have chosen,

114
00:04:40,107 --> 00:04:44,205
from 1 to 6, the levels are attached randomly.

115
00:04:44,206 --> 00:04:46,476
(Level 1 to 6 are randomly attached on the doors they chose.)

116
00:04:46,477 --> 00:04:48,705
(The guests randomly chose the levels?)

117
00:04:48,706 --> 00:04:50,332
- Really? - We'll get to take those levels!

118
00:04:50,477 --> 00:04:53,749
- Gosh, we should choose wisely. - We still have a shot.

119
00:04:53,816 --> 00:04:55,331
- We might be able to win. - Exactly.

120
00:04:55,347 --> 00:04:57,538
Someone will reach Level 10 today.

121
00:04:57,717 --> 00:05:00,555
Then we'll bring out the first guest now.

122
00:05:00,556 --> 00:05:02,586
- Who is it? - Come on out, please.

123
00:05:02,587 --> 00:05:03,838
First guest, please come on out.

124
00:05:03,927 --> 00:05:04,966
Who is it?

125
00:05:05,597 --> 00:05:07,950
(What is the identity of the first partner?)

126
00:05:07,996 --> 00:05:10,794
- It's been so long. - It's been ages, Jong Hyun.

127
00:05:11,867 --> 00:05:16,676
(He won over all the hearts of the female viewers.)

128
00:05:16,677 --> 00:05:20,406
(He was also great on the show with his unexpected talent 3 years ago.)

129
00:05:20,407 --> 00:05:23,145
(We're looking forward to his outstanding work today again.)

130
00:05:23,146 --> 00:05:25,338
- It's been ages, Jong Hyun. - Have you been well?

131
00:05:25,547 --> 00:05:26,815
- Hello. - Jong Hyun.

132
00:05:26,816 --> 00:05:28,616
(She heartily welcomes him.)

133
00:05:28,617 --> 00:05:31,787
Why does your hairstyle look like an alien's today?

134
00:05:32,186 --> 00:05:33,926
(Anyway, what happened to your hair?)

135
00:05:33,927 --> 00:05:35,356
My hairstyle is shaped like a lid.

136
00:05:35,357 --> 00:05:36,955
- The hairstyle is exactly the same. - He has your hairstyle.

137
00:05:36,956 --> 00:05:38,226
Don't point that out.

138
00:05:38,227 --> 00:05:39,625
You have Se Chan's hairstyle.

139
00:05:39,626 --> 00:05:42,195
- That hairstyle is from Gangnam. - It's been so long.

140
00:05:42,196 --> 00:05:43,765
- But his hairstyle seems different. - He has Se Chan's hairstyle.

141
00:05:43,766 --> 00:05:45,366
Hey, you two should pair up today.

142
00:05:45,367 --> 00:05:47,466
Why did he copy my hairstyle?

143
00:05:47,467 --> 00:05:49,123
- It looks just like his hairstyle. - Their hairstyles are the same.

144
00:05:49,206 --> 00:05:51,660
- Hello. - Gosh, this is annoying.

145
00:05:52,237 --> 00:05:53,745
This is embarrassing for some reason.

146
00:05:53,746 --> 00:05:55,261
This isn't the hairstylist's problem.

147
00:05:55,576 --> 00:05:56,976
Gosh, this is annoying.

148
00:05:56,977 --> 00:05:58,431
Hey, yours looks just like his.

149
00:05:58,717 --> 00:06:00,665
Gosh, this hairstyle actually looks nice.

150
00:06:00,686 --> 00:06:02,616
- Your hairstyle is trendy. - It's a popular hairstyle.

151
00:06:02,617 --> 00:06:03,856
- It's popular. - Seriously.

152
00:06:03,857 --> 00:06:05,586
We'll bring in the second guest.

153
00:06:05,587 --> 00:06:06,940
Please come on out.

154
00:06:06,987 --> 00:06:08,055
Come on out.

155
00:06:08,056 --> 00:06:09,856
(The second partner is revealed after the handsome alien.)

156
00:06:09,857 --> 00:06:10,995
(What is the identity of this partner?)

157
00:06:10,996 --> 00:06:12,269
- Goodness. - Hey.

158
00:06:13,396 --> 00:06:15,096
- Goodness. - Gosh, this is...

159
00:06:15,097 --> 00:06:16,565
(A genuine reaction)

160
00:06:16,566 --> 00:06:18,195
(She greets the second partner with laughter.)

161
00:06:18,196 --> 00:06:19,435
It's Seungri. Seungri.

162
00:06:19,436 --> 00:06:21,106
(The second partner is Seungri.)

163
00:06:21,107 --> 00:06:24,035
(The Great Seungri, Seungri of BigBang)

164
00:06:24,477 --> 00:06:26,476
(His solo album was a hit, and his business was a hit.)

165
00:06:26,477 --> 00:06:28,406
(What on earth can't he do?)

166
00:06:28,407 --> 00:06:30,216
(The versatile and successful youngest...)

167
00:06:30,217 --> 00:06:32,046
(has returned after 4 months.)

168
00:06:32,047 --> 00:06:34,086
- Seungri is like our family. - Seungri.

169
00:06:34,087 --> 00:06:35,286
(Here's the Great Seungri,)

170
00:06:35,287 --> 00:06:37,586
(but their reaction is somewhat lukewarm.)

171
00:06:37,587 --> 00:06:39,435
- You're here, Seungri. - Wait.

172
00:06:39,516 --> 00:06:41,426
- Why don't you sound more excited? - No, it's because...

173
00:06:41,427 --> 00:06:43,821
When you saw Jong Hyun, you were really happy to see him.

174
00:06:43,927 --> 00:06:45,512
It's been a while since he was here.

175
00:06:45,927 --> 00:06:47,209
You're like our family.

176
00:06:47,227 --> 00:06:49,347
First of all, Jong Hyun and Seungri...

177
00:06:49,766 --> 00:06:52,463
- Guys don't matter. - Yes, they're not that important.

178
00:06:52,496 --> 00:06:54,355
They aren't that important to me.

179
00:06:54,436 --> 00:06:56,466
We're continuing after Seungri and Jong Hyun's introductions.

180
00:06:56,467 --> 00:06:57,705
Third partner, please come on out.

181
00:06:57,706 --> 00:06:59,276
(The third partner is revealed next.)

182
00:06:59,277 --> 00:07:00,375
Here it comes!

183
00:07:00,376 --> 00:07:01,719
(The third partner is revealed next.)

184
00:07:02,376 --> 00:07:03,616
Number three, come on out.

185
00:07:03,617 --> 00:07:05,676
(What is the identity of the third partner?)

186
00:07:05,677 --> 00:07:06,745
It's Yu Mi.

187
00:07:06,746 --> 00:07:08,385
(Actress Jung Yu Mi, full of awesome charms)

188
00:07:08,386 --> 00:07:09,599
Jung Yu Mi!

189
00:07:10,417 --> 00:07:15,809
(She has become the queen of TV dramas with her superb acting.)

190
00:07:16,927 --> 00:07:18,856
(She's great on variety shows and radio shows.)

191
00:07:18,857 --> 00:07:20,644
(You can't find an all-around beauty like her anywhere else.)

192
00:07:21,126 --> 00:07:23,836
(Hello)

193
00:07:23,837 --> 00:07:24,966
- My gosh. - Jung Yu Mi!

194
00:07:24,967 --> 00:07:26,036
(Welcoming urgently)

195
00:07:26,037 --> 00:07:27,635
It's been so long. Hello.

196
00:07:27,636 --> 00:07:29,687
- Hello. Hi. - Goodness.

197
00:07:29,936 --> 00:07:31,176
My goodness.

198
00:07:31,177 --> 00:07:33,359
(My goodness)

199
00:07:33,907 --> 00:07:37,776
(Jae Seok, her idol, is right in front of her.)

200
00:07:37,777 --> 00:07:40,216
(Is this really happening?)

201
00:07:40,217 --> 00:07:42,165
- It's been so long. - Me too.

202
00:07:42,417 --> 00:07:44,416
(Feeling shy)

203
00:07:44,417 --> 00:07:46,055
I'm a big fan.

204
00:07:46,056 --> 00:07:47,399
I was trying to shake your hands...

205
00:07:47,527 --> 00:07:49,405
from here, but I ended over there.

206
00:07:49,657 --> 00:07:51,141
- Come this way, Yu Mi. - Hello.

207
00:07:52,357 --> 00:07:53,841
- Hello. - She's never been on our show?

208
00:07:54,266 --> 00:07:55,508
- Hello. Yes. - This is her first time here.

209
00:07:55,527 --> 00:07:58,036
Why do I feel like she's been on our show before?

210
00:07:58,037 --> 00:07:59,166
Is that so?

211
00:07:59,167 --> 00:08:00,836
- I was always with you guys. - Really?

212
00:08:00,837 --> 00:08:02,452
- At home. - My goodness.

213
00:08:02,706 --> 00:08:04,676
What a great mindset. That was so nice.

214
00:08:04,677 --> 00:08:06,253
Goodness, she's a go-getter.

215
00:08:06,506 --> 00:08:07,505
(Jae Seok is excited to meet a fan.)

216
00:08:07,506 --> 00:08:10,446
- We shook hands. How many times? - How many times will you do it?

217
00:08:10,576 --> 00:08:12,496
- Looking at you two like this... - Yes.

218
00:08:12,977 --> 00:08:15,346
You two look like two hosts.

219
00:08:15,347 --> 00:08:16,786
Really? That came out of nowhere.

220
00:08:16,787 --> 00:08:19,210
- It's like "March of the Youth". - That was sudden.

221
00:08:19,357 --> 00:08:20,786
- Do we look like them? - Yes.

222
00:08:20,787 --> 00:08:22,100
- "March of the Youth". - It's your outfit too.

223
00:08:22,556 --> 00:08:23,926
Your outfits match nicely.

224
00:08:23,927 --> 00:08:26,156
Don't you think her outfit is too fancy?

225
00:08:26,157 --> 00:08:27,308
Compared to my outfit?

226
00:08:27,797 --> 00:08:28,796
Can't I wear a fancy outfit?

227
00:08:28,797 --> 00:08:30,395
- It can't be fancy. - Is that so?

228
00:08:30,396 --> 00:08:33,096
By the way, at the beginning of the year,

229
00:08:33,097 --> 00:08:34,924
we had the press conference.

230
00:08:35,136 --> 00:08:37,834
Ji Hyo made an unexpected remark out of nowhere.

231
00:08:38,006 --> 00:08:40,005
- "You have me." - That's right.

232
00:08:40,006 --> 00:08:41,865
A lot of viewers said...

233
00:08:42,146 --> 00:08:44,175
- they made a nice couple. - It's a nice match.

234
00:08:44,176 --> 00:08:45,965
- They make a great couple. - You guys met naturally.

235
00:08:46,276 --> 00:08:48,045
- I'm serious. - This isn't natural.

236
00:08:48,046 --> 00:08:49,602
- It's a very natural way to meet. - It was natural.

237
00:08:49,786 --> 00:08:51,837
- This is the most natural way. - Natural relationship.

238
00:08:51,857 --> 00:08:54,125
But still. Our colors are so different.

239
00:08:54,126 --> 00:08:55,369
How are they different?

240
00:08:55,626 --> 00:08:57,625
- Our colors are very different. - No.

241
00:08:57,626 --> 00:08:59,395
This. This color...

242
00:08:59,396 --> 00:09:01,895
is like the asphalt on the road, and she's the centerline.

243
00:09:01,896 --> 00:09:05,736
(Jong Gook is the asphalt and Ji Hyo is the centerline.)

244
00:09:05,737 --> 00:09:07,423
What are you saying? Why am I asphalt?

245
00:09:07,837 --> 00:09:09,120
That's right.

246
00:09:10,136 --> 00:09:11,405
(Bursting with anger)

247
00:09:11,406 --> 00:09:13,035
- This is the asphalt. - Why is this asphalt?

248
00:09:13,036 --> 00:09:14,806
- She's the centerline. - Why am I the asphalt?

249
00:09:14,807 --> 00:09:17,675
- You're on the road together. - What? Do you hear yourself?

250
00:09:17,676 --> 00:09:19,465
They're the safety zone.

251
00:09:19,876 --> 00:09:22,116
- This is nice. It's nice. - They make a nice couple.

252
00:09:22,117 --> 00:09:23,956
- You look great together. - She's the radish in gimbap.

253
00:09:23,957 --> 00:09:25,804
(He finds another example.)

254
00:09:26,057 --> 00:09:28,425
- My goodness, come on. - She's the radish in gimbap.

255
00:09:28,426 --> 00:09:30,925
- That's right. What else? - Gimbap.

256
00:09:30,926 --> 00:09:32,846
- What other examples do we have? - There are so many.

257
00:09:32,957 --> 00:09:34,915
- What else? - I'm sure there are many.

258
00:09:35,496 --> 00:09:37,596
- Let's stop here. Go back in there. - Okay, okay.

259
00:09:37,597 --> 00:09:39,866
I wonder who the fourth partner is. Let's bring the partner in.

260
00:09:39,867 --> 00:09:41,725
- Come on out. - Who is it?

261
00:09:42,337 --> 00:09:43,366
- Who is it? - Who is it?

262
00:09:43,367 --> 00:09:46,063
(What is the identity of the partner this time?)

263
00:09:46,837 --> 00:09:48,576
- It's Yu Ri. Lee Yu Ri. - I was so startled.

264
00:09:48,577 --> 00:09:50,839
(Actress Lee Yu Ri, sweet and scary lady)

265
00:09:51,117 --> 00:09:56,802
(She has become the best villainess with her excellent acting.)

266
00:09:57,587 --> 00:09:59,755
(She ruled Running Man with her crazy energy...)

267
00:09:59,756 --> 00:10:01,948
(from her tiny build 5 years ago.)

268
00:10:02,087 --> 00:10:05,596
(I'm the number one villainess in this area.)

269
00:10:05,597 --> 00:10:08,020
- Gosh, I didn't recognize you. - Seriously.

270
00:10:08,467 --> 00:10:10,688
- Hello. - Have you been well?

271
00:10:11,437 --> 00:10:14,436
- Your dramas have been successful. - That's right.

272
00:10:14,837 --> 00:10:15,966
Thank you.

273
00:10:15,967 --> 00:10:18,275
Yu Ri has been on our show often.

274
00:10:18,276 --> 00:10:19,436
Why are you shy? What is it?

275
00:10:19,437 --> 00:10:20,557
I was here five years ago.

276
00:10:20,746 --> 00:10:22,106
- Yes, it was 5 years ago. - 5 years ago?

277
00:10:22,107 --> 00:10:23,175
Really?

278
00:10:23,176 --> 00:10:24,316
That has been five years?

279
00:10:24,317 --> 00:10:25,946
- It was the Villainess Special. - Oh, right.

280
00:10:25,947 --> 00:10:27,145
It was the Villainess Special.

281
00:10:27,146 --> 00:10:29,686
- That special was really fun too. - Right.

282
00:10:29,687 --> 00:10:31,433
- Right. - That's right.

283
00:10:31,617 --> 00:10:33,316
All right. 5th and 6th partners.

284
00:10:33,317 --> 00:10:35,206
They'll come out at the same time. Come on out, please.

285
00:10:35,457 --> 00:10:36,568
At the same time?

286
00:10:36,587 --> 00:10:37,826
- Are they a team? - My gosh.

287
00:10:37,827 --> 00:10:40,079
(What are the identities of the last partners?)

288
00:10:40,697 --> 00:10:42,665
(MinA and Jimin of AOA, irreplaceable idol singers)

289
00:10:42,666 --> 00:10:44,990
(MinA and Jimin of AOA, irreplaceable idol singers)

290
00:10:45,067 --> 00:10:48,366
(This girl group with popular songs always sweeps the charts.)

291
00:10:48,367 --> 00:10:50,265
(MinA, multitalented, hidden gem)

292
00:10:50,266 --> 00:10:52,054
(Jimin, the prettiest rapper)

293
00:10:52,406 --> 00:10:56,106
(AOA has dominated the dramas as well as the variety shows.)

294
00:10:56,107 --> 00:10:57,530
It's AOA. AOA.

295
00:10:58,016 --> 00:10:59,576
- They are MinA and Jimin. - MinA.

296
00:10:59,577 --> 00:11:00,728
(Welcome, isn't this your first time here?)

297
00:11:01,786 --> 00:11:03,245
- You and I are in the same agency. - What brings you here?

298
00:11:03,246 --> 00:11:04,974
(That came out of nowhere.)

299
00:11:05,057 --> 00:11:07,208
- You are in the same agency. - I know that.

300
00:11:07,487 --> 00:11:08,556
Where should we stand?

301
00:11:08,557 --> 00:11:09,798
- Come here. - Okay.

302
00:11:11,026 --> 00:11:12,056
I find...

303
00:11:12,057 --> 00:11:13,255
(Chuckling)

304
00:11:13,256 --> 00:11:14,525
MinA is so funny.

305
00:11:14,526 --> 00:11:15,809
Yes!

306
00:11:15,926 --> 00:11:17,966
She was so happy to see me.

307
00:11:17,967 --> 00:11:19,196
I asked her why.

308
00:11:19,197 --> 00:11:20,265
"We're in the same agency."

309
00:11:20,266 --> 00:11:23,296
(That's the best!)

310
00:11:24,676 --> 00:11:26,323
They must have met for the 1st time. Is it your 1st time?

311
00:11:26,376 --> 00:11:29,106
- Yes, it's my 1st time meeting him. - It's your 1st time. I see.

312
00:11:29,107 --> 00:11:31,415
- She's so funny. - I'm nervous.

313
00:11:31,416 --> 00:11:32,476
Nice to meet you.

314
00:11:32,477 --> 00:11:34,638
- Please take good care of us. - Okay.

315
00:11:35,286 --> 00:11:37,206
All right.

316
00:11:37,386 --> 00:11:39,841
We brought out all of the partners including Jimin and MinA.

317
00:11:39,886 --> 00:11:43,392
We're going to check the partners' levels first.

318
00:11:43,857 --> 00:11:45,956
Getting a good partner is important, but levels are important too.

319
00:11:45,957 --> 00:11:47,138
(The levels are chosen randomly.)

320
00:11:47,867 --> 00:11:49,746
- Right. - This is important.

321
00:11:50,026 --> 00:11:52,724
- Jong Hyun came out of this room. - Yes.

322
00:11:52,937 --> 00:11:54,836
Let's check Jong Hyun's level first.

323
00:11:54,837 --> 00:11:56,018
I wonder what his level is.

324
00:11:56,237 --> 00:11:58,875
(Jong Hyun chose the first door.)

325
00:11:58,876 --> 00:12:03,816
(What is his level?)

326
00:12:03,817 --> 00:12:04,976
It's Level Four.

327
00:12:04,977 --> 00:12:06,375
(Jong Hyun is Level 4.)

328
00:12:06,376 --> 00:12:07,885
- That's high. - That's high.

329
00:12:07,886 --> 00:12:10,008
My goodness, that's great.

330
00:12:10,817 --> 00:12:11,867
Next.

331
00:12:12,057 --> 00:12:13,399
We'll check Seungri's level.

332
00:12:14,156 --> 00:12:15,925
- We'll check Seungri's level. - Seungri.

333
00:12:15,926 --> 00:12:19,230
(Seungri came out of the second door. What is his level?)

334
00:12:19,396 --> 00:12:22,495
(Seungri, Level 2)

335
00:12:22,496 --> 00:12:25,295
- That's low. - It's only two.

336
00:12:25,296 --> 00:12:26,781
- His level isn't... - That's low.

337
00:12:27,467 --> 00:12:28,866
- It's pretty low if it's two. - It's low.

338
00:12:28,867 --> 00:12:29,905
Next.

339
00:12:29,906 --> 00:12:31,606
By the way, why are we standing here? We keep getting pushed.

340
00:12:31,607 --> 00:12:36,191
(By the way, why are we standing here? We keep getting pushed.)

341
00:12:36,977 --> 00:12:39,415
(They stood at the wrong spot to begin with.)

342
00:12:39,416 --> 00:12:41,216
(This is how little by little,)

343
00:12:41,217 --> 00:12:44,816
(they are getting farther away.)

344
00:12:44,817 --> 00:12:46,486
- We keep getting pushed away. - Hey.

345
00:12:46,487 --> 00:12:47,871
Why did we stand here?

346
00:12:48,327 --> 00:12:50,696
(Exactly. Why is this happening to you two?)

347
00:12:50,697 --> 00:12:51,826
- By the way, - It keeps...

348
00:12:51,827 --> 00:12:53,826
- only I can move down. - We have to move down together.

349
00:12:53,827 --> 00:12:55,925
- We keep going back and forth. - We keep getting pushed.

350
00:12:55,926 --> 00:12:58,466
- You two make a great couple. - Exactly. Why...

351
00:12:58,467 --> 00:13:00,706
Ji Hyo, you should lock arms with him and go down.

352
00:13:00,707 --> 00:13:02,135
They are the Gimbap Couple.

353
00:13:02,136 --> 00:13:03,336
- Jong Kook. - You know what?

354
00:13:03,337 --> 00:13:04,635
- Let's go to that side. - You two look great.

355
00:13:04,636 --> 00:13:06,005
We keep getting in the way.

356
00:13:06,006 --> 00:13:08,502
- Roll it nicely - This is weird.

357
00:13:09,176 --> 00:13:10,933
You two make a great couple.

358
00:13:10,977 --> 00:13:13,269
- We keep getting pushed down. - That's so true.

359
00:13:13,447 --> 00:13:14,759
All right. We'll move on.

360
00:13:15,347 --> 00:13:17,780
- This time, it was Yu Mi's, right? - Yes.

361
00:13:18,786 --> 00:13:20,625
It's Yu Mi's. We'll check her level.

362
00:13:20,626 --> 00:13:22,356
(What is Yu Mi's level?)

363
00:13:22,357 --> 00:13:23,356
I think it might be high.

364
00:13:23,357 --> 00:13:26,625
(Yu Mi has the highest level, Level 6.)

365
00:13:26,626 --> 00:13:29,454
(Yu Mi has the highest level?)

366
00:13:29,796 --> 00:13:31,211
- That's so high. - Yu Mi.

367
00:13:31,396 --> 00:13:33,488
(Crowding over her)

368
00:13:33,867 --> 00:13:35,066
- It's not that. - Seriously.

369
00:13:35,067 --> 00:13:36,419
- I really need you. - I'm serious.

370
00:13:36,536 --> 00:13:38,336
- She has the highest level. - Yu Mi.

371
00:13:38,337 --> 00:13:40,226
- Yu Mi, when we choose partners... - Yu Mi.

372
00:13:40,307 --> 00:13:42,427
- I was going to choose you. - Yu Mi.

373
00:13:42,577 --> 00:13:46,515
- I have been her fan too. - My gosh.

374
00:13:46,516 --> 00:13:47,645
Goodness.

375
00:13:47,646 --> 00:13:49,186
She and I are like family. I'm serious.

376
00:13:49,187 --> 00:13:50,227
- Why is she your family? - I'm serious.

377
00:13:50,656 --> 00:13:52,403
She's Level Six.

378
00:13:52,557 --> 00:13:55,155
- That's amazing. - It's hard to choose Level Six.

379
00:13:55,156 --> 00:13:56,826
Next up is Yu Ri.

380
00:13:56,827 --> 00:13:58,025
(It's time to reveal Yu Ri's level.)

381
00:13:58,026 --> 00:13:59,340
- We'll check her level. - Is it Level Six?

382
00:13:59,496 --> 00:14:00,696
We'll check her level.

383
00:14:00,697 --> 00:14:04,895
(What is Yu Ri's level?)

384
00:14:04,896 --> 00:14:07,336
(Yu Ri has the lowest level, Level 1.)

385
00:14:07,337 --> 00:14:08,518
- Level One? - Gosh.

386
00:14:09,337 --> 00:14:11,630
- Gosh. - Goodness, what is she going to do?

387
00:14:12,837 --> 00:14:14,664
But Yu Ri and Jae Seok look great together.

388
00:14:14,947 --> 00:14:16,706
- I'm serious. - You are perfect for each other.

389
00:14:16,707 --> 00:14:18,091
You're Level One.

390
00:14:18,376 --> 00:14:19,527
That's perfect.

391
00:14:20,077 --> 00:14:21,846
Level One is considered quite low.

392
00:14:21,847 --> 00:14:23,058
All right.

393
00:14:23,146 --> 00:14:24,934
- Is this your door, MinA? - Yes.

394
00:14:25,016 --> 00:14:27,682
- Let's see MinA's level. - I hope it's high.

395
00:14:28,057 --> 00:14:29,655
(It has to be high.)

396
00:14:29,656 --> 00:14:32,795
(What is the fifth guest, MinA's level?)

397
00:14:32,796 --> 00:14:34,295
Level Three.

398
00:14:34,296 --> 00:14:35,866
(MinA's level is 3.)

399
00:14:35,867 --> 00:14:37,895
- It's not bad. - It's pretty high.

400
00:14:37,896 --> 00:14:39,895
- Jimin's level... - She's Level Five.

401
00:14:39,896 --> 00:14:41,017
She's Level Five.

402
00:14:41,536 --> 00:14:44,476
(Jimin's level is 5.)

403
00:14:44,477 --> 00:14:47,103
(Nice, my level is high.)

404
00:14:51,947 --> 00:14:55,149
Those with high levels, Levels 5 and 6...

405
00:14:55,386 --> 00:14:58,415
We're desperate to team up with them.

406
00:14:58,416 --> 00:15:00,056
The thing is,

407
00:15:00,057 --> 00:15:03,865
Kwang Soo and I go back a long way.

408
00:15:03,957 --> 00:15:05,125
It's been more than 10 years.

409
00:15:05,126 --> 00:15:07,792
I knew him before he became Asia Prince.

410
00:15:07,967 --> 00:15:09,925
When he was a nobody.

411
00:15:09,926 --> 00:15:12,492
(When he was a nobody)

412
00:15:12,796 --> 00:15:14,405
That's right.

413
00:15:14,406 --> 00:15:16,066
(Asia Prince used to be a nobody.)

414
00:15:16,067 --> 00:15:17,875
You knew him when he was a nobody.

415
00:15:17,876 --> 00:15:20,775
These days, he's so stylish.

416
00:15:20,776 --> 00:15:23,076
What was he like when he was a nobody?

417
00:15:23,077 --> 00:15:25,197
He was pathetic.

418
00:15:25,447 --> 00:15:27,076
(She tells the truth.)

419
00:15:27,077 --> 00:15:28,803
He was.

420
00:15:29,546 --> 00:15:32,015
She was your fan even back then.

421
00:15:32,016 --> 00:15:33,804
Really?

422
00:15:33,957 --> 00:15:36,356
When you got married,

423
00:15:36,357 --> 00:15:38,255
I was so sad.

424
00:15:38,256 --> 00:15:39,995
For the first time in my life...

425
00:15:39,996 --> 00:15:41,613
- Really? - Seriously?

426
00:15:42,166 --> 00:15:45,795
Just like when Brad Pitt got married...

427
00:15:45,796 --> 00:15:48,606
(It made her as sad.)

428
00:15:48,607 --> 00:15:50,135
- When Jae Seok got married... - They're too different.

429
00:15:50,136 --> 00:15:51,405
They're too different. Hold on.

430
00:15:51,406 --> 00:15:53,606
- Why would you bring up Brad Pitt? - She's making fun of you.

431
00:15:53,607 --> 00:15:55,565
You shouldn't be so happy. She's just making fun of you.

432
00:15:55,646 --> 00:15:57,576
- Brad Pitt... - She's making fun of him.

433
00:15:57,577 --> 00:15:58,991
Brad Pitt.

434
00:15:59,347 --> 00:16:01,086
- Is it true? - It's true.

435
00:16:01,087 --> 00:16:03,116
Brad Pitt looked way better than Jae Seok...

436
00:16:03,117 --> 00:16:05,385
- even when he played an old man. - Benjamin Button...

437
00:16:05,386 --> 00:16:07,655
- Stop it. - He looked way better.

438
00:16:07,656 --> 00:16:08,785
Gosh.

439
00:16:08,786 --> 00:16:10,326
You deserve a flying kick.

440
00:16:10,327 --> 00:16:11,495
(The Curious Case of Yu Mi's Taste)

441
00:16:11,496 --> 00:16:12,755
Anyway...

442
00:16:12,756 --> 00:16:14,615
We're so happy to have you here.

443
00:16:14,697 --> 00:16:16,165
In addition,

444
00:16:16,166 --> 00:16:18,661
- she's Level 6. - Level 6.

445
00:16:18,937 --> 00:16:21,505
We're so grateful.

446
00:16:21,506 --> 00:16:23,386
And we have Jong Hyun here too.

447
00:16:23,707 --> 00:16:25,393
- He's handsome. - Level Four.

448
00:16:26,176 --> 00:16:29,045
That hairstyle suits you very well.

449
00:16:29,046 --> 00:16:30,793
- Thank you. - It looks nice.

450
00:16:31,347 --> 00:16:33,175
Hairstyles...

451
00:16:33,176 --> 00:16:35,145
What's important is how your face looks.

452
00:16:35,146 --> 00:16:37,316
- I think so too. - That's right.

453
00:16:37,317 --> 00:16:38,956
It's like that.

454
00:16:38,957 --> 00:16:41,255
Some people look good whether their hair is long...

455
00:16:41,256 --> 00:16:42,655
- or short. - Right.

456
00:16:42,656 --> 00:16:44,475
- Or even all shaved off. - Of course.

457
00:16:44,756 --> 00:16:46,596
Do you want to try an acrostic poem? It's been a while.

458
00:16:46,597 --> 00:16:48,866
(Show off your charms.)

459
00:16:48,867 --> 00:16:50,495
- I'll try with "Jeon So Min". - "Jeon So Min".

460
00:16:50,496 --> 00:16:52,566
(An acrostic poem dedicated to me?)

461
00:16:52,567 --> 00:16:53,708
(She steps forward.)

462
00:16:54,266 --> 00:16:56,035
You don't have to step forward.

463
00:16:56,036 --> 00:16:57,505
She looked annoyingly happy.

464
00:16:57,506 --> 00:16:58,588
(There she goes again.)

465
00:16:58,876 --> 00:17:00,694
All right. "Jeon".

466
00:17:01,876 --> 00:17:02,946
Jeon...

467
00:17:02,947 --> 00:17:04,746
I didn't know this before.

468
00:17:04,747 --> 00:17:07,145
(I didn't know this before.)

469
00:17:07,146 --> 00:17:08,316
- That's a nice start. - She's touching her hair again.

470
00:17:08,317 --> 00:17:09,397
"So".

471
00:17:10,017 --> 00:17:12,056
(I didn't know this before.)

472
00:17:12,057 --> 00:17:14,955
So Min, you look very beautiful in real life.

473
00:17:15,287 --> 00:17:16,639
She looks beautiful.

474
00:17:17,226 --> 00:17:18,796
(Are you asking me out?)

475
00:17:18,797 --> 00:17:19,856
"Min".

476
00:17:19,857 --> 00:17:24,066
(So Min, you look very beautiful in real life.)

477
00:17:24,067 --> 00:17:25,380
Min.

478
00:17:25,696 --> 00:17:27,606
I'll make sure you get to the highest level today.

479
00:17:27,607 --> 00:17:29,829
(Min, I'll make sure you get to the highest level today.)

480
00:17:29,966 --> 00:17:34,006
(Min, you'll get to the highest level today.)

481
00:17:34,007 --> 00:17:35,675
What's wrong with him?

482
00:17:35,676 --> 00:17:37,475
(He can't stand it.)

483
00:17:37,476 --> 00:17:39,116
What's with him? Hey.

484
00:17:39,117 --> 00:17:40,561
What is wrong with him?

485
00:17:40,916 --> 00:17:42,185
"I'll make sure you get to the highest level."

486
00:17:42,186 --> 00:17:43,328
My goodness.

487
00:17:43,416 --> 00:17:44,699
I can't stand these things.

488
00:17:45,117 --> 00:17:46,356
(Was it too much?)

489
00:17:46,357 --> 00:17:48,074
It makes me cringe.

490
00:17:48,757 --> 00:17:49,885
Let me try too.

491
00:17:49,886 --> 00:17:50,925
(So Min is sentimental today.)

492
00:17:50,926 --> 00:17:52,326
- What do you mean? - Let me come up with a poem.

493
00:17:52,327 --> 00:17:53,925
(So Min is a poet today.)

494
00:17:53,926 --> 00:17:55,366
So suddenly?

495
00:17:55,367 --> 00:17:57,347
- Let me try. - Go ahead.

496
00:17:57,966 --> 00:17:58,976
"Hong".

497
00:17:59,436 --> 00:18:00,981
Hong, hong, hong...

498
00:18:01,436 --> 00:18:03,124
Hong, hong, hong...

499
00:18:04,236 --> 00:18:07,035
(Was it a bad idea?)

500
00:18:09,176 --> 00:18:10,258
"Jong".

501
00:18:10,347 --> 00:18:12,576
My feelings for Jong Hyun are...

502
00:18:12,577 --> 00:18:13,776
(My feelings for Jong Hyun are...)

503
00:18:13,777 --> 00:18:17,346
(My feelings for you...)

504
00:18:17,347 --> 00:18:18,396
"Hyun".

505
00:18:19,456 --> 00:18:23,455
(What is it?)

506
00:18:23,456 --> 00:18:25,648
Still going on.

507
00:18:26,626 --> 00:18:30,637
(They're still going on.)

508
00:18:31,696 --> 00:18:34,366
(The other members react aggressively.)

509
00:18:34,367 --> 00:18:36,235
Why are you hitting me?

510
00:18:36,236 --> 00:18:37,675
Why me?

511
00:18:37,676 --> 00:18:38,776
(The set is in shock.)

512
00:18:38,777 --> 00:18:39,875
Gosh.

513
00:18:39,876 --> 00:18:41,175
It's so annoying.

514
00:18:41,176 --> 00:18:43,731
(With the set full of love, someone looks troubled.)

515
00:18:44,047 --> 00:18:49,885
(He remains still.)

516
00:18:49,886 --> 00:18:52,056
Next up is Seungri.

517
00:18:52,057 --> 00:18:53,616
I heard...

518
00:18:53,617 --> 00:18:56,385
Seungri is joining the army this year.

519
00:18:56,386 --> 00:18:57,596
- Yes. - That's what I heard.

520
00:18:57,597 --> 00:18:58,856
- This year? - Yes.

521
00:18:58,857 --> 00:19:00,987
- When? - Early this year.

522
00:19:01,067 --> 00:19:02,885
- Early this year? - Yes.

523
00:19:02,926 --> 00:19:04,296
It's soon.

524
00:19:04,297 --> 00:19:05,435
And he's still working.

525
00:19:05,436 --> 00:19:07,528
I'll work hard until then.

526
00:19:08,267 --> 00:19:09,705
And then I'll hand over the baton...

527
00:19:09,706 --> 00:19:11,506
to the other members.

528
00:19:11,507 --> 00:19:13,698
He sounds so humble today. Last time, he was like,

529
00:19:13,736 --> 00:19:15,705
"G-DRAGON, are you watching?"

530
00:19:15,706 --> 00:19:18,145
Now that he's joining the army soon, he doesn't say that anymore.

531
00:19:18,146 --> 00:19:19,186
(Sad)

532
00:19:20,547 --> 00:19:24,655
(Last time, Seungri couldn't contain his excitement.)

533
00:19:24,656 --> 00:19:26,586
(White Skull Division, are you watching?)

534
00:19:26,587 --> 00:19:28,356
(Victory Division, are you watching?)

535
00:19:28,357 --> 00:19:32,134
(He didn't hesitate to declare war.)

536
00:19:32,297 --> 00:19:35,665
(He was full of spirit.)

537
00:19:35,666 --> 00:19:38,266
Now that he's joining the army soon, he doesn't say that anymore.

538
00:19:38,267 --> 00:19:40,336
- He sounds so humble. - The others will be out soon.

539
00:19:40,337 --> 00:19:42,635
And it's slowly starting to feel real.

540
00:19:42,636 --> 00:19:44,135
His voice has become so calm.

541
00:19:44,136 --> 00:19:45,875
He sounds so humble.

542
00:19:45,876 --> 00:19:47,806
His voice sounded completely different last year.

543
00:19:47,807 --> 00:19:49,276
He was like, "Are you watching?"

544
00:19:49,277 --> 00:19:51,445
I'll be humble. White Skull Division,

545
00:19:51,446 --> 00:19:52,790
how are you doing?

546
00:19:53,317 --> 00:19:56,316
(I send my regards before enlistment.)

547
00:19:56,317 --> 00:19:57,415
Insert the clips from the last time.

548
00:19:57,416 --> 00:19:59,116
It was so funny.

549
00:19:59,117 --> 00:20:00,571
Last time, it was cheeky of me.

550
00:20:00,716 --> 00:20:02,885
You never know. I might end up in those divisions.

551
00:20:02,886 --> 00:20:03,885
You never know.

552
00:20:03,886 --> 00:20:04,925
Who knows?

553
00:20:04,926 --> 00:20:06,256
If that happens,

554
00:20:06,257 --> 00:20:08,695
they might be like, "Last year, you said..."

555
00:20:08,696 --> 00:20:11,796
White Skull Division,

556
00:20:11,797 --> 00:20:13,452
I wish you all a happy new year.

557
00:20:14,067 --> 00:20:15,205
Take care.

558
00:20:15,206 --> 00:20:16,705
His voice has changed completely.

559
00:20:16,706 --> 00:20:17,875
He is very wise.

560
00:20:17,876 --> 00:20:20,536
The final level-up race,

561
00:20:20,537 --> 00:20:22,899
Catch-up Partner.

562
00:20:25,676 --> 00:20:29,050
The teams will compete in two rounds.

563
00:20:29,117 --> 00:20:31,510
After each round, the team in 1st place will go up 2 levels,

564
00:20:31,557 --> 00:20:34,617
and the team in 2nd place, 1 level.

565
00:20:35,386 --> 00:20:37,086
When anyone gets to Level 10,

566
00:20:37,087 --> 00:20:39,225
that person becomes the final winner...

567
00:20:39,226 --> 00:20:40,843
and the race will be over.

568
00:20:40,966 --> 00:20:44,165
The winning team will receive a tremendous prize.

569
00:20:44,166 --> 00:20:46,866
Defense is important too.

570
00:20:46,867 --> 00:20:49,536
If Haha and So Min win two times in a row,

571
00:20:49,537 --> 00:20:50,566
the race will be over.

572
00:20:50,567 --> 00:20:51,836
- Defense is important. - Really?

573
00:20:51,837 --> 00:20:53,492
- However... - However?

574
00:20:54,077 --> 00:20:57,475
If no one gets to Level 10 before the mission is complete,

575
00:20:57,476 --> 00:21:00,346
the final winners will be determined by the roulette wheel.

576
00:21:00,347 --> 00:21:02,346
The combined levels within the team...

577
00:21:02,347 --> 00:21:04,911
will determine the number of slots they get.

578
00:21:05,257 --> 00:21:06,786
Level is everything.

579
00:21:06,787 --> 00:21:08,807
(How will this race end?)

580
00:21:10,926 --> 00:21:13,583
- Let's decide teams. - Okay.

581
00:21:14,597 --> 00:21:17,222
I'm only interested in Level 3 and above.

582
00:21:17,267 --> 00:21:19,519
The rules are simple.

583
00:21:19,767 --> 00:21:22,006
Each person will announce the requirements,

584
00:21:22,007 --> 00:21:23,965
and the others will try to meet them.

585
00:21:23,966 --> 00:21:25,956
- Anyone can try? - Yes.

586
00:21:25,976 --> 00:21:28,606
Let's start from So Min, Level Six.

587
00:21:28,607 --> 00:21:30,975
- What are your requirements? - Tell us.

588
00:21:30,976 --> 00:21:32,546
(What does she want her partner to be like?)

589
00:21:32,547 --> 00:21:35,112
- Hi. - Hi.

590
00:21:35,186 --> 00:21:37,286
- Hi. - Hello.

591
00:21:37,287 --> 00:21:39,307
Inside, I'm thinking,

592
00:21:39,416 --> 00:21:41,455
"What is she doing?"

593
00:21:41,456 --> 00:21:42,556
(Their reactions are forced.)

594
00:21:42,557 --> 00:21:43,925
She suddenly said, "Hi."

595
00:21:43,926 --> 00:21:44,936
Hi.

596
00:21:45,196 --> 00:21:47,195
Why are you so worked up?

597
00:21:47,196 --> 00:21:48,296
What's with you?

598
00:21:48,297 --> 00:21:50,395
I'm Level Zero.

599
00:21:50,396 --> 00:21:54,134
I can't believe you're still holding on to hope.

600
00:21:54,367 --> 00:21:55,506
(Wait and see.)

601
00:21:55,507 --> 00:21:56,606
I'm Jae Seok.

602
00:21:56,607 --> 00:21:57,606
He's so optimistic.

603
00:21:57,607 --> 00:22:00,735
My level is high. I like humorous people.

604
00:22:00,736 --> 00:22:02,998
I want my partner to be good at role-playing.

605
00:22:03,406 --> 00:22:05,871
(She wants a partner who is humorous and good at role-playing.)

606
00:22:06,646 --> 00:22:10,152
(Role-playing? Should I try?)

607
00:22:10,386 --> 00:22:11,955
Excuse me.

608
00:22:11,956 --> 00:22:14,139
- Food delivery. - Hello.

609
00:22:14,186 --> 00:22:15,786
Thank you.

610
00:22:15,787 --> 00:22:16,885
(The delivery guy is handsome.)

611
00:22:16,886 --> 00:22:18,725
(Did you order a partner?)

612
00:22:18,726 --> 00:22:21,423
Excuse me. We ordered it. Come here.

613
00:22:21,827 --> 00:22:23,395
(Interrupting)

614
00:22:23,396 --> 00:22:25,066
It's our food. What are you doing?

615
00:22:25,067 --> 00:22:26,195
Come here.

616
00:22:26,196 --> 00:22:27,935
Why did you go there?

617
00:22:27,936 --> 00:22:29,165
Put it here.

618
00:22:29,166 --> 00:22:31,631
You don't recognize your regular customer?

619
00:22:31,837 --> 00:22:33,250
It's our food.

620
00:22:33,507 --> 00:22:36,435
All right. So Min will say a line.

621
00:22:36,547 --> 00:22:38,415
- And we will react to it. - Okay.

622
00:22:38,416 --> 00:22:40,901
We're in a cafe.

623
00:22:40,976 --> 00:22:43,685
I'm waiting for my boyfriend.

624
00:22:43,686 --> 00:22:44,768
(So Min is waiting for her boyfriend in a cafe.)

625
00:22:45,287 --> 00:22:48,792
(This is my chance.)

626
00:22:49,357 --> 00:22:52,026
(She enters the cafe.)

627
00:22:52,027 --> 00:22:53,915
Is he not here yet?

628
00:22:53,926 --> 00:22:55,178
- Honey! - So Min!

629
00:22:55,626 --> 00:22:57,242
- Honey! - Honey!

630
00:22:57,597 --> 00:22:58,949
- "Honey"? - Honey!

631
00:22:59,196 --> 00:23:00,266
So Min!

632
00:23:00,267 --> 00:23:01,478
Honey!

633
00:23:01,867 --> 00:23:03,606
(Swarming)

634
00:23:03,607 --> 00:23:05,394
- Honey! - Sorry I'm late.

635
00:23:05,706 --> 00:23:07,135
Honey, I'm sorry I'm late.

636
00:23:07,136 --> 00:23:08,346
- I've been here since yesterday. - Honey.

637
00:23:08,347 --> 00:23:09,606
- Sorry. - Sorry.

638
00:23:09,607 --> 00:23:10,846
I'm not interested in religion.

639
00:23:10,847 --> 00:23:12,375
- That's not it. - Honey.

640
00:23:12,376 --> 00:23:13,715
- Sorry. - You and I...

641
00:23:13,716 --> 00:23:14,945
Who are you?

642
00:23:14,946 --> 00:23:16,215
- Honey. - Who are you?

643
00:23:16,216 --> 00:23:17,445
(Honey)

644
00:23:17,446 --> 00:23:18,885
(Her real boyfriend appears.)

645
00:23:18,886 --> 00:23:20,099
I'm her boyfriend. Who are you?

646
00:23:20,186 --> 00:23:22,786
(I'm her boyfriend. Who are you?)

647
00:23:22,787 --> 00:23:25,296
(I'm Level 4, honey. Stay away from low levels.)

648
00:23:25,297 --> 00:23:27,044
- Let us be a team. - Hold on.

649
00:23:27,396 --> 00:23:29,425
(Since both our levels are high, shouldn't we team up?)

650
00:23:29,426 --> 00:23:30,811
Honey, what are you doing?

651
00:23:31,896 --> 00:23:34,096
(What is my boyfriend doing here?)

652
00:23:34,097 --> 00:23:35,165
What about me?

653
00:23:35,166 --> 00:23:37,086
Hey, come get the empty bowls. What are you doing here?

654
00:23:37,706 --> 00:23:39,475
(The bowls are at the door.)

655
00:23:39,476 --> 00:23:41,175
- Collect your bowls. - Over here.

656
00:23:41,176 --> 00:23:42,806
What were you doing there?

657
00:23:42,807 --> 00:23:44,175
Okay.

658
00:23:44,176 --> 00:23:45,591
They're over here.

659
00:23:45,777 --> 00:23:46,975
This is strange.

660
00:23:46,976 --> 00:23:48,685
- Please try something else. - Why isn't he here yet?

661
00:23:48,686 --> 00:23:50,316
Come up with something else.

662
00:23:50,317 --> 00:23:51,685
Why isn't he here yet?

663
00:23:51,686 --> 00:23:53,715
My boyfriend is very handsome.

664
00:23:53,716 --> 00:23:54,786
(I'm here.)

665
00:23:54,787 --> 00:23:57,655
(Then I'm not your boyfriend.)

666
00:23:57,656 --> 00:24:00,155
(Jae Seok tries...)

667
00:24:00,156 --> 00:24:02,691
(but then gives up.)

668
00:24:03,126 --> 00:24:04,125
(He is definitely not my boyfriend.)

669
00:24:04,126 --> 00:24:06,056
- Come back. - Is she allowed to do that?

670
00:24:06,466 --> 00:24:10,135
(The other candidates support Jae Seok's decision.)

671
00:24:10,136 --> 00:24:11,489
Is she allowed to do that?

672
00:24:11,876 --> 00:24:13,735
- Is it okay? - She can do that.

673
00:24:13,736 --> 00:24:15,576
- Can she really do that? - She can.

674
00:24:15,577 --> 00:24:16,945
Suddenly...

675
00:24:16,946 --> 00:24:18,390
All right. Fine.

676
00:24:18,517 --> 00:24:19,790
Situation number three.

677
00:24:20,047 --> 00:24:22,542
What about a guesthouse?

678
00:24:22,617 --> 00:24:24,434
- A class trip? - A class trip.

679
00:24:24,956 --> 00:24:26,028
A class trip.

680
00:24:27,287 --> 00:24:28,885
She's alone?

681
00:24:28,886 --> 00:24:30,326
She's waiting for others.

682
00:24:30,327 --> 00:24:34,596
(So Min is drinking with her friends at a guesthouse.)

683
00:24:34,597 --> 00:24:37,294
- Gosh, I drank too much. - She's drunk.

684
00:24:37,696 --> 00:24:39,195
(Dizzy)

685
00:24:39,196 --> 00:24:40,408
So Min, are you okay?

686
00:24:41,507 --> 00:24:45,875
(I'm a senior. A freshman drank too much?)

687
00:24:45,876 --> 00:24:50,576
(It's the popular student, Kwang Soo.)

688
00:24:50,577 --> 00:24:52,346
You're a driver, right?

689
00:24:52,347 --> 00:24:53,875
(She didn't call you.)

690
00:24:53,876 --> 00:24:55,616
Come with us.

691
00:24:55,617 --> 00:24:57,839
We called you.

692
00:24:57,886 --> 00:24:59,786
He's a driver.

693
00:24:59,787 --> 00:25:02,086
What were you doing?

694
00:25:02,087 --> 00:25:04,256
They keep getting interrupted.

695
00:25:04,257 --> 00:25:05,973
(So Min will never meet her boyfriend.)

696
00:25:06,696 --> 00:25:09,996
(So Min tries to focus.)

697
00:25:09,997 --> 00:25:11,066
Let me try.

698
00:25:11,067 --> 00:25:12,248
(The handsome guy, Jong Hyun, steps up.)

699
00:25:12,797 --> 00:25:14,554
I'm getting drunk.

700
00:25:14,867 --> 00:25:16,755
How long has Jong Hyun been sitting there?

701
00:25:17,307 --> 00:25:18,675
Jong Hyun.

702
00:25:18,676 --> 00:25:20,696
(We have to stop him.)

703
00:25:20,876 --> 00:25:24,109
Jong Hyun, I'm not feeling so well.

704
00:25:25,117 --> 00:25:26,732
Do you want to go for a walk?

705
00:25:27,347 --> 00:25:30,516
(Do you want some fresh air?)

706
00:25:30,517 --> 00:25:32,738
- Sure. - I'm...

707
00:25:34,416 --> 00:25:38,195
(What if they become a team?)

708
00:25:38,196 --> 00:25:41,596
Everyone is watching. You go first...

709
00:25:41,597 --> 00:25:43,096
Hello, Professor Hong.

710
00:25:43,097 --> 00:25:44,266
(He is not a senior student.)

711
00:25:44,267 --> 00:25:46,358
(Professor Hong is here too?)

712
00:25:47,367 --> 00:25:48,806
(We didn't call for a driver.)

713
00:25:48,807 --> 00:25:51,807
- Security guard. - Security guard?

714
00:25:52,406 --> 00:25:54,426
I'm not feeling well.

715
00:25:54,847 --> 00:25:56,945
- I'm... - Are you done?

716
00:25:56,946 --> 00:25:58,675
Let me collect the bowls.

717
00:25:58,676 --> 00:25:59,776
(The delivery guy came all the way to the guesthouse.)

718
00:25:59,777 --> 00:26:03,120
Let me collect the bowls. Are you done?

719
00:26:04,486 --> 00:26:06,476
That restaurant is so popular.

720
00:26:06,757 --> 00:26:09,286
So Min will pick...

721
00:26:09,287 --> 00:26:11,356
her partner.

722
00:26:11,357 --> 00:26:12,996
- She is Level Six. - Seungri would be good.

723
00:26:12,997 --> 00:26:15,225
- Level Four would be enough. - Right.

724
00:26:15,226 --> 00:26:17,993
Jong Hyun...

725
00:26:18,436 --> 00:26:21,841
I'll pick someone who was active in the role-playing.

726
00:26:23,307 --> 00:26:25,875
(The old boyfriend, Seok Jin)

727
00:26:25,876 --> 00:26:28,475
(The handsome guy, Jong Hyun)

728
00:26:28,476 --> 00:26:33,375
(The guy who knows he is not handsome, Jae Seok)

729
00:26:33,376 --> 00:26:36,276
(The handsome delivery guy, Seungri)

730
00:26:36,686 --> 00:26:39,786
(Among the four...)

731
00:26:39,787 --> 00:26:42,526
I pick Jong Hyun.

732
00:26:42,527 --> 00:26:44,445
This is not okay.

733
00:26:45,057 --> 00:26:47,319
- The high levels should team up. - Gosh.

734
00:26:48,097 --> 00:26:49,965
Even if I lose...

735
00:26:49,966 --> 00:26:52,496
She just picked someone with a high level.

736
00:26:52,497 --> 00:26:54,386
I had to carry those bowls around all day long!

737
00:26:54,906 --> 00:26:57,266
(Everyone is only interested in those with high levels.)

738
00:26:57,267 --> 00:26:59,975
- I had to carry those bowls around! - You made mistakes.

739
00:26:59,976 --> 00:27:02,975
- Next up is Yu Mi. - I have to try.

740
00:27:02,976 --> 00:27:05,775
(What does Yu Mi want her partner to be like?)

741
00:27:06,176 --> 00:27:09,215
Yu Mi!

742
00:27:09,216 --> 00:27:11,913
- Whatever she wants... - I want to try too.

743
00:27:12,117 --> 00:27:15,385
I want someone who can think fast...

744
00:27:15,386 --> 00:27:17,951
because it'd help me win.

745
00:27:17,997 --> 00:27:20,695
We prepared a game.

746
00:27:20,696 --> 00:27:23,695
Water Cham Cham Cham.

747
00:27:23,696 --> 00:27:25,211
(Water Cham Cham Cham)

748
00:27:26,367 --> 00:27:28,506
Water Cham Cham Cham to find the fastest person.

749
00:27:28,507 --> 00:27:30,930
The rules are the same as usual.

750
00:27:31,067 --> 00:27:33,776
But instead of hitting the other person with a toy hammer,

751
00:27:33,777 --> 00:27:35,392
splash water from the glass.

752
00:27:35,676 --> 00:27:36,846
No one will want to try.

753
00:27:36,847 --> 00:27:38,896
- What are you talking about? - What are you talking about?

754
00:27:39,077 --> 00:27:40,475
(They all want to try.)

755
00:27:40,476 --> 00:27:42,385
- What are you talking about? - What are you talking about?

756
00:27:42,386 --> 00:27:44,507
(Satisfied)

757
00:27:44,716 --> 00:27:46,155
Like this?

758
00:27:46,156 --> 00:27:48,854
We'll go first.

759
00:27:49,126 --> 00:27:51,824
(Seok Jin versus Jae Seok)

760
00:27:52,797 --> 00:27:54,496
Let's play rock-paper-scissors.

761
00:27:54,497 --> 00:27:55,625
Okay.

762
00:27:55,626 --> 00:27:57,526
(The winner gets to attack first.)

763
00:27:57,527 --> 00:27:58,708
- Rock-paper-scissors - Rock-paper-scissors

764
00:27:58,997 --> 00:28:01,135
(Jae Seok gets to attack.)

765
00:28:01,136 --> 00:28:03,359
Cham, Cham, Cham.

766
00:28:03,706 --> 00:28:05,235
(Seok Jin turned his face first.)

767
00:28:05,236 --> 00:28:07,902
Hold on. Why...

768
00:28:08,376 --> 00:28:10,506
(Jae Seok easily wins.)

769
00:28:10,507 --> 00:28:12,776
What was that?

770
00:28:12,777 --> 00:28:15,145
Why did you turn your face?

771
00:28:15,146 --> 00:28:17,611
- My goodness. - Why did you?

772
00:28:19,017 --> 00:28:21,713
(Jae Seok wins.)

773
00:28:22,386 --> 00:28:24,256
- My goodness. - Seok Jin turned his face first.

774
00:28:24,257 --> 00:28:26,125
- I win. - Okay.

775
00:28:26,126 --> 00:28:27,874
(It's Se Chan and Kwang Soo's turn.)

776
00:28:27,956 --> 00:28:29,526
Se Chan versus Kwang Soo?

777
00:28:29,527 --> 00:28:31,536
The winner will compete with Jae Seok.

778
00:28:31,537 --> 00:28:33,657
- It's going to be fun. - Good.

779
00:28:34,367 --> 00:28:36,806
(Serious)

780
00:28:36,807 --> 00:28:38,675
- It's going to be fun. - These cheaters...

781
00:28:38,676 --> 00:28:41,474
- They're cheaters. - Cheater versus cheater.

782
00:28:42,646 --> 00:28:46,181
(Cheater versus cheater)

783
00:28:46,416 --> 00:28:47,776
- Rock-paper-scissors - Rock-paper-scissors

784
00:28:47,777 --> 00:28:48,786
(It's a big match.)

785
00:28:48,787 --> 00:28:49,846
- Rock-paper-scissors - Rock-paper-scissors

786
00:28:49,847 --> 00:28:51,776
(Kwang Soo gets to attack.)

787
00:28:52,886 --> 00:28:54,215
Finish it.

788
00:28:54,216 --> 00:28:56,408
(I can't believe I get to watch this big match.)

789
00:28:57,186 --> 00:28:58,195
Cham, Cham, Cham.

790
00:28:58,196 --> 00:28:59,206
(Se Chan looks left.)

791
00:28:59,527 --> 00:29:01,766
(It's Se Chan's turn to attack.)

792
00:29:01,767 --> 00:29:03,888
(He is no easy opponent.)

793
00:29:03,926 --> 00:29:05,596
Se Chan is good at this.

794
00:29:05,597 --> 00:29:07,717
(Excited)

795
00:29:08,867 --> 00:29:12,606
(Se Chan attacks.)

796
00:29:12,607 --> 00:29:13,747
What?

797
00:29:14,847 --> 00:29:16,975
(What's going on?)

798
00:29:16,976 --> 00:29:18,058
Cham, Cham, Cham.

799
00:29:18,617 --> 00:29:19,945
(Splash)

800
00:29:19,946 --> 00:29:20,986
Okay.

801
00:29:21,176 --> 00:29:22,985
(Se Chan baits Kwang Soo...)

802
00:29:22,986 --> 00:29:26,118
(and attacks.)

803
00:29:27,186 --> 00:29:29,385
(Cheating is my specialty.)

804
00:29:29,386 --> 00:29:31,781
- Good job. - Okay!

805
00:29:32,327 --> 00:29:34,326
- What happened? - You lost.

806
00:29:34,327 --> 00:29:35,596
You turned your face.

807
00:29:35,597 --> 00:29:37,195
You looked right.

808
00:29:37,196 --> 00:29:38,206
(The audience is thrilled.)

809
00:29:38,537 --> 00:29:41,296
- Did I do something wrong? - You did a good job.

810
00:29:41,297 --> 00:29:43,457
- Cham, Cham, Cham. - Nice!

811
00:29:43,537 --> 00:29:45,022
- Okay! - Good job.

812
00:29:45,277 --> 00:29:47,600
I had to be fast.

813
00:29:47,736 --> 00:29:48,918
It happened so fast.

814
00:29:49,277 --> 00:29:50,963
All right.

815
00:29:51,577 --> 00:29:53,846
I'll finish it at once. There's no need to waste time.

816
00:29:53,847 --> 00:29:55,786
We'll finish it at once.

817
00:29:55,787 --> 00:29:58,316
The winner goes up six levels.

818
00:29:58,317 --> 00:29:59,985
This is the chance.

819
00:29:59,986 --> 00:30:01,573
Jae Seok, your glasses...

820
00:30:01,587 --> 00:30:02,586
Why don't we...

821
00:30:02,587 --> 00:30:03,799
(I have a suggestion.)

822
00:30:04,956 --> 00:30:07,596
Why don't we attack with the pot and defend with the cup?

823
00:30:07,597 --> 00:30:08,796
(Attack with the pot and defend with the cup?)

824
00:30:08,797 --> 00:30:11,019
- What do you say? - Let's get more water.

825
00:30:11,267 --> 00:30:12,751
Come on. Let's do it.

826
00:30:13,436 --> 00:30:15,356
- To your eyes. - Okay.

827
00:30:16,107 --> 00:30:18,336
You don't even drink. "To your eyes"?

828
00:30:18,337 --> 00:30:20,576
(You're making a toast?)

829
00:30:20,577 --> 00:30:23,246
- Be quiet. - "To your eyes"?

830
00:30:23,247 --> 00:30:25,516
I guess that's what he says when he drinks water.

831
00:30:25,517 --> 00:30:27,276
He just wanted to say it.

832
00:30:27,277 --> 00:30:28,385
There's not enough water.

833
00:30:28,386 --> 00:30:29,729
It's okay.

834
00:30:29,747 --> 00:30:30,897
It's not much.

835
00:30:31,047 --> 00:30:33,215
- This is going to be... - That looks good.

836
00:30:33,216 --> 00:30:34,955
You'll have to win.

837
00:30:34,956 --> 00:30:35,985
(There is a lot more water now.)

838
00:30:35,986 --> 00:30:38,248
Even if you cover yourself, you'll still get wet.

839
00:30:38,896 --> 00:30:40,008
- Rock-paper-scissors - Rock-paper-scissors

840
00:30:40,126 --> 00:30:42,824
(Jae Seok gets to attack.)

841
00:30:43,466 --> 00:30:44,996
- Oh, my. - I have to stop him.

842
00:30:44,997 --> 00:30:46,108
(I have to stop him.)

843
00:30:47,636 --> 00:30:48,766
Cham, Cham, Cham.

844
00:30:48,767 --> 00:30:50,506
(They turn in the same direction.)

845
00:30:50,507 --> 00:30:51,991
(Splash)

846
00:30:52,136 --> 00:30:53,506
You can't help getting wet.

847
00:30:53,507 --> 00:30:54,945
(Se Chan did try to cover his face,)

848
00:30:54,946 --> 00:30:57,300
(but what?)

849
00:30:57,577 --> 00:30:59,637
You can't help getting wet.

850
00:30:59,676 --> 00:31:01,175
- I did block it. - You did block it.

851
00:31:01,176 --> 00:31:03,773
- It counts. - I blocked it.

852
00:31:03,886 --> 00:31:06,079
You blocked it?

853
00:31:06,787 --> 00:31:09,352
- I saw it. - It didn't get to my eyes.

854
00:31:09,386 --> 00:31:10,526
It didn't get to my eyes.

855
00:31:10,527 --> 00:31:13,253
- He blocked it. - I saw it.

856
00:31:13,297 --> 00:31:14,695
- So you can block it. - Okay.

857
00:31:14,696 --> 00:31:16,766
- Rock-paper-scissors - Rock-paper-scissors

858
00:31:16,767 --> 00:31:18,555
(Jae Seok gets to attack.)

859
00:31:19,966 --> 00:31:21,108
Just one try.

860
00:31:21,367 --> 00:31:22,405
Cham, Cham, Cham.

861
00:31:22,406 --> 00:31:23,806
(If he wins, he can be Yu Mi's partner.)

862
00:31:23,807 --> 00:31:26,705
(I can't let Jae Seok get a high-level partner.)

863
00:31:29,376 --> 00:31:31,506
(They turn in the same direction.)

864
00:31:31,507 --> 00:31:33,496
(What?)

865
00:31:33,976 --> 00:31:35,046
What did you do?

866
00:31:35,047 --> 00:31:36,485
(He succeeded...)

867
00:31:36,486 --> 00:31:39,011
(but splashed himself with cold water.)

868
00:31:39,557 --> 00:31:43,356
(What did I do?)

869
00:31:43,357 --> 00:31:45,125
(He mixed up offense and defense.)

870
00:31:45,126 --> 00:31:46,695
Why did you do that?

871
00:31:46,696 --> 00:31:48,425
What was that?

872
00:31:48,426 --> 00:31:49,625
He tried to block it.

873
00:31:49,626 --> 00:31:52,195
He thought he was supposed to block it?

874
00:31:52,196 --> 00:31:54,235
I'm sorry.

875
00:31:54,236 --> 00:31:56,766
- I'm sorry. - It looked natural.

876
00:31:56,767 --> 00:31:59,475
- Okay. - He's so bad at games.

877
00:31:59,476 --> 00:32:01,506
- Rock-paper-scissors - Rock-paper-scissors

878
00:32:01,507 --> 00:32:04,001
(Jae Seok gets to attack again.)

879
00:32:05,047 --> 00:32:06,415
(If he wins, he becomes Yu Mi's partner.)

880
00:32:06,416 --> 00:32:07,445
Cham, Cham, Cham.

881
00:32:07,446 --> 00:32:08,629
(Will Jae Seok manage to level up?)

882
00:32:08,787 --> 00:32:12,393
(I have to stop him.)

883
00:32:13,787 --> 00:32:16,385
(They turn in the same direction.)

884
00:32:16,386 --> 00:32:17,801
(Splash)

885
00:32:18,396 --> 00:32:20,496
(Se Chan fails to block it.)

886
00:32:20,497 --> 00:32:22,596
- Jae Seok wins. - Okay!

887
00:32:22,597 --> 00:32:23,625
(Jae Seok manages to level up.)

888
00:32:23,626 --> 00:32:24,996
Okay.

889
00:32:24,997 --> 00:32:26,866
- The situation has changed. - That was close.

890
00:32:26,867 --> 00:32:29,765
- Next up is Jong Kook. - Me?

891
00:32:30,406 --> 00:32:33,336
This game seems fun.

892
00:32:33,406 --> 00:32:36,475
- I want to do it too. - With female guests?

893
00:32:36,476 --> 00:32:38,516
- I think it'll be fun. - It sounds good.

894
00:32:38,517 --> 00:32:40,193
(Jong Kook wants to partner up with a Water Cham Cham Cham master.)

895
00:32:40,916 --> 00:32:42,985
- Should we try? - Let's try.

896
00:32:42,986 --> 00:32:44,286
- We want to try. - We want to try.

897
00:32:44,287 --> 00:32:45,286
(The ace joins too.)

898
00:32:45,287 --> 00:32:47,056
- Ji Hyo wants to try too. - Ji Hyo wants to try too.

899
00:32:47,057 --> 00:32:49,207
A guy can try too. One more person can join.

900
00:32:49,587 --> 00:32:53,334
(A guy can try too?)

901
00:32:54,196 --> 00:32:57,366
You want to try? Okay.

902
00:32:57,367 --> 00:33:01,851
(I want to be your partner today.)

903
00:33:02,136 --> 00:33:03,854
Okay. Good.

904
00:33:04,037 --> 00:33:05,776
(Jong Kook is the best.)

905
00:33:05,777 --> 00:33:07,106
Good.

906
00:33:07,107 --> 00:33:08,776
- Seungri, you should try too. - Kim Jong Kook!

907
00:33:08,777 --> 00:33:10,868
- Kim Jong Kook! - Come here.

908
00:33:11,146 --> 00:33:12,975
(I'm Level 2. Let me try too.)

909
00:33:12,976 --> 00:33:15,168
Seungri, welcome.

910
00:33:15,186 --> 00:33:17,885
I won't be a bad choice.

911
00:33:17,886 --> 00:33:19,856
(Jimin versus Yu Ri, Seungri versus Ji Hyo,)

912
00:33:19,857 --> 00:33:21,534
(Se Chan versus Kwang Soo)

913
00:33:22,057 --> 00:33:24,586
I can't wait to see how they play this game.

914
00:33:24,587 --> 00:33:26,779
- Right. - Play rock-paper-scissors.

915
00:33:27,196 --> 00:33:30,196
- Rock-paper-scissors - Rock-paper-scissors

916
00:33:30,367 --> 00:33:32,496
(Hiding?)

917
00:33:32,497 --> 00:33:34,536
Hold on. Are you sure?

918
00:33:34,537 --> 00:33:37,735
(She introduces a new strategy, hiding her hand.)

919
00:33:37,736 --> 00:33:40,175
She is unbelievable.

920
00:33:40,176 --> 00:33:42,576
I swear!

921
00:33:42,577 --> 00:33:44,970
- This is... - This is not okay.

922
00:33:45,347 --> 00:33:46,776
If that was okay, everybody would play like that.

923
00:33:46,777 --> 00:33:48,786
Jimin. Are you sure?

924
00:33:48,787 --> 00:33:51,312
- I swear. - I saw it from here.

925
00:33:51,317 --> 00:33:53,407
Okay.

926
00:33:53,486 --> 00:33:55,225
- Rock-paper-scissors - Rock-paper-scissors

927
00:33:55,226 --> 00:33:56,701
(Yu Ri gets to attack.)

928
00:33:57,686 --> 00:33:59,413
- Wait. - Not now?

929
00:33:59,797 --> 00:34:02,395
(She instinctively tries to splash water.)

930
00:34:02,396 --> 00:34:04,895
- You have to play Cham Cham Cham. - You have to play Cham Cham Cham.

931
00:34:04,896 --> 00:34:07,392
You can't just splash water.

932
00:34:08,066 --> 00:34:10,329
- She's scary. - You can't just splash water.

933
00:34:10,466 --> 00:34:12,105
- Cham, Cham, Cham. - Okay.

934
00:34:12,106 --> 00:34:13,675
Rock-paper-scissors doesn't mean much.

935
00:34:13,676 --> 00:34:14,835
Cham, Cham, Cham.

936
00:34:14,836 --> 00:34:16,795
(They turn in different directions.)

937
00:34:16,906 --> 00:34:17,945
Rock-paper-scissors.

938
00:34:17,946 --> 00:34:19,976
(Jimin gets to attack.)

939
00:34:19,977 --> 00:34:22,085
(Jimin attacks.)

940
00:34:22,086 --> 00:34:23,186
Cham, Cham, Cham.

941
00:34:23,187 --> 00:34:25,715
(The hand turns left.)

942
00:34:25,716 --> 00:34:27,616
(Yu Ri's face...)

943
00:34:27,617 --> 00:34:29,385
(also turns left.)

944
00:34:29,386 --> 00:34:30,700
I blocked it.

945
00:34:30,827 --> 00:34:32,096
(Jimin attacks quickly.)

946
00:34:32,097 --> 00:34:33,238
(Yu Ri defends more quickly.)

947
00:34:33,256 --> 00:34:34,525
- I blocked it. - She blocked it.

948
00:34:34,526 --> 00:34:36,041
- She blocked it. - Good job.

949
00:34:36,727 --> 00:34:39,195
(You aren't angry, are you?)

950
00:34:39,196 --> 00:34:41,994
- She didn't get hit. - She blocked it.

951
00:34:42,406 --> 00:34:44,387
- Do it fast. - Rock-paper-scissors

952
00:34:44,636 --> 00:34:45,976
(Yu Ri gets to attack.)

953
00:34:45,977 --> 00:34:47,206
Let me fill up the water.

954
00:34:47,207 --> 00:34:48,823
- I'll go first. - Wait.

955
00:34:49,176 --> 00:34:50,576
I understand that you're angry,

956
00:34:50,577 --> 00:34:51,759
- but fill it with water first. - What?

957
00:34:51,877 --> 00:34:54,116
(Awkward)

958
00:34:54,117 --> 00:34:55,116
Cham, Cham, Cham.

959
00:34:55,117 --> 00:34:57,065
(Her faces turns toward her hand.)

960
00:34:57,446 --> 00:34:59,173
(Splashing)

961
00:35:00,356 --> 00:35:01,956
(Villain Yu Ri knows...)

962
00:35:01,957 --> 00:35:03,626
(how to splash water.)

963
00:35:03,627 --> 00:35:05,000
Were you waiting...

964
00:35:05,196 --> 00:35:06,255
for this?

965
00:35:06,256 --> 00:35:10,569
(Yu Ri's fiery and mean snap shown 5 years ago)

966
00:35:10,867 --> 00:35:13,219
(She still has it.)

967
00:35:13,696 --> 00:35:15,555
- That's incredible. - Her look was intense.

968
00:35:16,437 --> 00:35:18,698
She's done it a lot.

969
00:35:18,877 --> 00:35:21,059
- I'm sorry. - It's okay.

970
00:35:21,336 --> 00:35:22,505
- Oh, no. - All right.

971
00:35:22,506 --> 00:35:23,876
The way she snaps is...

972
00:35:23,877 --> 00:35:25,675
- She did it a lot in dramas. - sharp.

973
00:35:25,676 --> 00:35:27,394
Isn't it different? Next are...

974
00:35:27,517 --> 00:35:29,305
- Ji Hyo and Seungri. - Seungri.

975
00:35:29,386 --> 00:35:31,063
Ji Hyo isn't easy.

976
00:35:31,787 --> 00:35:32,985
Don't think she's easy.

977
00:35:32,986 --> 00:35:34,532
Will it be Seungri or Ji Hyo?

978
00:35:34,787 --> 00:35:36,626
- Will it be Ji Hyo or Seungri? - Seungri.

979
00:35:36,627 --> 00:35:39,555
Will it be Seungri or Ji Hyo? Or will it be Ji Hyo or Seungri?

980
00:35:39,597 --> 00:35:40,667
Play rock-paper-scissors.

981
00:35:41,196 --> 00:35:42,379
- Rock-paper-scissors - Rock-paper-scissors

982
00:35:42,627 --> 00:35:45,394
(Ji Hyo gets to attack.)

983
00:35:46,196 --> 00:35:47,409
Cham, Cham, Cham.

984
00:35:48,437 --> 00:35:49,666
(Seungri is quite fast.)

985
00:35:49,667 --> 00:35:51,065
- Do we play rock-paper-scissors? - No, it's his turn next.

986
00:35:51,066 --> 00:35:52,451
Keep playing.

987
00:35:52,477 --> 00:35:53,576
Without playing rock-paper-scissors?

988
00:35:53,577 --> 00:35:55,376
(They take turns with Cham, Cham, Cham.)

989
00:35:55,377 --> 00:35:56,387
Okay.

990
00:35:56,606 --> 00:35:57,605
Cham, Cham, Cham.

991
00:35:57,606 --> 00:35:59,715
(Her head turns toward his hand.)

992
00:35:59,716 --> 00:36:01,292
(Splashing and blocking)

993
00:36:01,986 --> 00:36:03,286
(He attacks fast.)

994
00:36:03,287 --> 00:36:05,885
(She blocks him completely.)

995
00:36:05,886 --> 00:36:07,255
(I'm an ace.)

996
00:36:07,256 --> 00:36:08,771
- Nice. - That was quick.

997
00:36:09,227 --> 00:36:10,742
- That's Ji Hyo. - That was quick.

998
00:36:11,356 --> 00:36:12,669
She blocked it perfectly.

999
00:36:12,727 --> 00:36:13,925
She blocked it completely.

1000
00:36:13,926 --> 00:36:15,056
(Ji Hyo is an ace after all.)

1001
00:36:15,057 --> 00:36:16,295
(She fits her face inside the pot.)

1002
00:36:16,296 --> 00:36:17,396
You're amazing.

1003
00:36:17,397 --> 00:36:18,695
Keep playing.

1004
00:36:18,696 --> 00:36:19,996
(It's Ji Hyo's attack.)

1005
00:36:19,997 --> 00:36:21,684
(He turns the opposite direction.)

1006
00:36:21,796 --> 00:36:22,806
Cham, Cham, Cham.

1007
00:36:22,807 --> 00:36:24,505
(She turns toward his hand.)

1008
00:36:24,506 --> 00:36:25,536
(Splashing and blocking)

1009
00:36:25,537 --> 00:36:26,547
Cham, Cham, Cham.

1010
00:36:26,836 --> 00:36:27,835
(She blocks it completely.)

1011
00:36:27,836 --> 00:36:29,306
- She blocked it. - She did.

1012
00:36:29,307 --> 00:36:30,846
- She blocked it. - That was good.

1013
00:36:30,847 --> 00:36:31,945
(She's like a human shield.)

1014
00:36:31,946 --> 00:36:33,562
Seungri is slow.

1015
00:36:33,716 --> 00:36:35,808
- I thought Seungri got slow. - Me too.

1016
00:36:35,847 --> 00:36:36,928
He was very slow.

1017
00:36:36,986 --> 00:36:39,209
Whoever wins this round will be the final winner.

1018
00:36:39,457 --> 00:36:40,528
Cham, Cham, Cham.

1019
00:36:40,656 --> 00:36:42,444
(He turns toward her hand.)

1020
00:36:42,526 --> 00:36:43,626
What's going on?

1021
00:36:43,627 --> 00:36:44,868
(Splashing)

1022
00:36:45,426 --> 00:36:48,425
(Why is she grabbing the pot?)

1023
00:36:48,426 --> 00:36:52,465
(She splashes without giving him a chance to defend.)

1024
00:36:52,466 --> 00:36:54,036
Ji Hyo wins.

1025
00:36:54,037 --> 00:36:56,366
(Ace Ji Hyo enters the semifinal round.)

1026
00:36:56,367 --> 00:36:58,706
Next up are Se Chan and Kwang Soo.

1027
00:36:58,707 --> 00:36:59,918
It's fun when they compete.

1028
00:37:01,077 --> 00:37:02,306
- You start right away. - Come closer.

1029
00:37:02,307 --> 00:37:05,377
(They're more serious than before.)

1030
00:37:05,747 --> 00:37:06,876
I'll stand like this.

1031
00:37:06,877 --> 00:37:08,058
I'll stand like this.

1032
00:37:08,316 --> 00:37:10,116
(Their mission is Cham, Cham, Cham with legs.)

1033
00:37:10,117 --> 00:37:11,916
(What's wrong with them?)

1034
00:37:11,917 --> 00:37:13,301
Like this?

1035
00:37:13,656 --> 00:37:15,456
What's going on? Is it a leg fight?

1036
00:37:15,457 --> 00:37:16,639
That's great.

1037
00:37:16,727 --> 00:37:17,755
Rock-paper-scissors

1038
00:37:17,756 --> 00:37:19,096
(Kwang Soo gets to attack.)

1039
00:37:19,097 --> 00:37:20,238
Okay.

1040
00:37:21,557 --> 00:37:22,779
Let's see if it's okay or not.

1041
00:37:23,926 --> 00:37:27,295
(He attacks with confidence.)

1042
00:37:27,296 --> 00:37:30,538
(Se Chan's defense is a success.)

1043
00:37:30,836 --> 00:37:32,089
I could read him.

1044
00:37:32,176 --> 00:37:33,505
Do it right away.

1045
00:37:33,506 --> 00:37:34,635
(They're both passionate.)

1046
00:37:34,636 --> 00:37:35,787
Which way will you go?

1047
00:37:36,647 --> 00:37:38,797
- This way. - That way? Okay.

1048
00:37:39,046 --> 00:37:40,275
Cham, Cham, Cham.

1049
00:37:40,276 --> 00:37:42,206
(He turns toward his hand.)

1050
00:37:42,886 --> 00:37:44,502
(Thanks to Jae Seok, it splashes on him.)

1051
00:37:45,417 --> 00:37:46,616
(He's quicker than either of them.)

1052
00:37:46,617 --> 00:37:48,475
(Jae Seok assists the attack.)

1053
00:37:48,787 --> 00:37:50,456
(Why are you involved?)

1054
00:37:50,457 --> 00:37:51,568
He won.

1055
00:37:52,156 --> 00:37:53,826
(With Jae Seok's help,)

1056
00:37:53,827 --> 00:37:55,626
(Se Chan moves up to the semifinal round.)

1057
00:37:55,627 --> 00:37:59,536
(Jae Seok speeds things up since they're running out of time.)

1058
00:37:59,537 --> 00:38:00,565
It should be over.

1059
00:38:00,566 --> 00:38:01,779
We're already running late.

1060
00:38:02,106 --> 00:38:04,235
All right, Se Chan will move on...

1061
00:38:04,236 --> 00:38:05,550
- to the semifinal. - Okay.

1062
00:38:05,977 --> 00:38:07,997
- I'm going to the semifinal. - Okay.

1063
00:38:08,336 --> 00:38:09,605
Next are...

1064
00:38:09,606 --> 00:38:11,275
Yu Ri and Ji Hyo.

1065
00:38:11,276 --> 00:38:13,346
It'll be a neck and neck game.

1066
00:38:13,347 --> 00:38:15,175
- It will be... - Tables may turn.

1067
00:38:15,176 --> 00:38:16,398
worth watching.

1068
00:38:16,816 --> 00:38:20,315
(She blocks any water splashing.)

1069
00:38:20,316 --> 00:38:22,711
(Ji Hyo is a human shield.)

1070
00:38:23,026 --> 00:38:25,326
(Her attacks pierce through all kinds of shields.)

1071
00:38:25,327 --> 00:38:28,285
(Yu Ri is an expert in splashing water.)

1072
00:38:29,267 --> 00:38:30,943
This is practically the final round.

1073
00:38:31,767 --> 00:38:33,514
- Rock-paper-scissors - Rock-paper-scissors

1074
00:38:33,836 --> 00:38:35,666
(Ji Hyo gets to attack.)

1075
00:38:35,667 --> 00:38:38,105
(She checks where the water is.)

1076
00:38:38,106 --> 00:38:39,275
Cham, Cham, Cham.

1077
00:38:39,276 --> 00:38:41,296
(She turns away from her hand.)

1078
00:38:41,736 --> 00:38:42,876
(Turning)

1079
00:38:42,877 --> 00:38:45,045
(Yu Ri's attack is quick as it's a big match.)

1080
00:38:45,046 --> 00:38:47,346
(Yu Ri's attack is quick as it's a big match.)

1081
00:38:47,347 --> 00:38:49,306
(Ji Hyo turns toward Yu Ri's hand.)

1082
00:38:49,486 --> 00:38:51,405
(Blocking and splashing)

1083
00:38:51,986 --> 00:38:56,556
(She turns into a human shield.)

1084
00:38:56,557 --> 00:38:58,546
(However, there was a malfunction.)

1085
00:38:58,656 --> 00:39:00,056
Wait, are you okay?

1086
00:39:00,057 --> 00:39:01,425
- What's wrong? - Are you okay?

1087
00:39:01,426 --> 00:39:03,114
(She hit her tooth with the pot.)

1088
00:39:03,296 --> 00:39:04,408
Are you bleeding?

1089
00:39:05,127 --> 00:39:06,396
(I'm okay.)

1090
00:39:06,397 --> 00:39:08,565
We're playing this game to pick our partners, right?

1091
00:39:08,566 --> 00:39:11,466
(We're playing this game to pick our partners, right?)

1092
00:39:11,937 --> 00:39:13,576
I almost thought the first round was over.

1093
00:39:13,577 --> 00:39:14,706
As they were playing...

1094
00:39:14,707 --> 00:39:16,576
- We haven't officially started. - Goodness.

1095
00:39:16,577 --> 00:39:19,142
- I feel competitive. - It makes me feel competitive.

1096
00:39:19,347 --> 00:39:20,616
- Do we play again? - Yes.

1097
00:39:20,617 --> 00:39:21,916
(Ji Hyo attacks.)

1098
00:39:21,917 --> 00:39:23,835
(Yu Ri turns toward Ji Hyo's hand.)

1099
00:39:23,986 --> 00:39:25,116
(Splashing)

1100
00:39:25,117 --> 00:39:26,470
Ji Hyo wins.

1101
00:39:26,756 --> 00:39:28,686
(Ji Hyo isn't only a human shield.)

1102
00:39:28,687 --> 00:39:31,056
(Ji Hyo splashes water quickly as well.)

1103
00:39:31,057 --> 00:39:34,525
(Unfortunately, Yu Ri is eliminated and Ji Hyo enters the final round.)

1104
00:39:34,526 --> 00:39:35,965
Here's the final round.

1105
00:39:35,966 --> 00:39:38,218
It's Ji Hyo versus Se Chan.

1106
00:39:38,836 --> 00:39:41,361
Jimin hasn't done it yet.

1107
00:39:41,537 --> 00:39:43,688
- She hasn't? - She hasn't done it.

1108
00:39:43,867 --> 00:39:45,078
She's Level Five.

1109
00:39:45,707 --> 00:39:47,394
- There is Level 5. - Level 5 remains.

1110
00:39:47,437 --> 00:39:48,536
There is Level Five.

1111
00:39:48,537 --> 00:39:50,365
- Is there Level Five? - Here we go.

1112
00:39:50,647 --> 00:39:53,142
Leve 4 and 5 are the same.

1113
00:39:54,816 --> 00:39:55,998
Cham, Cham, Cham.

1114
00:39:56,486 --> 00:39:58,305
(He's very slow.)

1115
00:39:59,457 --> 00:40:00,932
(Okay, I'll lose.)

1116
00:40:01,517 --> 00:40:03,001
Hey, Se Chan.

1117
00:40:03,156 --> 00:40:04,398
- What did you do? - What?

1118
00:40:04,557 --> 00:40:06,456
- What's wrong with you? - Let me go.

1119
00:40:06,457 --> 00:40:07,855
(Ji Hyo and Jong Kook are a couple again.)

1120
00:40:07,856 --> 00:40:09,396
Why did you play like that?

1121
00:40:09,397 --> 00:40:11,166
- My goodness. - I couldn't help it.

1122
00:40:11,167 --> 00:40:12,479
I couldn't move.

1123
00:40:12,597 --> 00:40:14,465
- You won. - It can be confusing.

1124
00:40:14,466 --> 00:40:17,405
What on earth? Okay.

1125
00:40:17,406 --> 00:40:19,426
- That was so strange. - Goodness, Se Chan.

1126
00:40:20,636 --> 00:40:23,105
Jimin is under the spotlight now.

1127
00:40:23,106 --> 00:40:24,592
- I'm sure of it. - It's Jimin.

1128
00:40:24,747 --> 00:40:26,695
Jimin, please step forward.

1129
00:40:26,847 --> 00:40:28,462
- Jimin is Level Five. - Yes.

1130
00:40:28,647 --> 00:40:30,100
I'm Level Five.

1131
00:40:30,716 --> 00:40:32,202
I'm addicted to acrostic poems.

1132
00:40:32,586 --> 00:40:34,708
(She wants someone who makes excellent acrostic poems.)

1133
00:40:35,287 --> 00:40:36,855
You get bonus points if you use my name.

1134
00:40:36,856 --> 00:40:37,937
Of course.

1135
00:40:38,057 --> 00:40:39,440
- All right. - With two syllables?

1136
00:40:39,497 --> 00:40:41,195
No, I'm Shin Jimin.

1137
00:40:41,196 --> 00:40:42,726
- Shin? - Yes, Shin Jimin.

1138
00:40:42,727 --> 00:40:43,925
- Do we have to include Shin? - Yes.

1139
00:40:43,926 --> 00:40:45,126
Can you do it with Shin Jimin?

1140
00:40:45,127 --> 00:40:46,207
"Shin".

1141
00:40:46,367 --> 00:40:48,335
Shin Jimin.

1142
00:40:48,336 --> 00:40:49,335
(Why are you calling me?)

1143
00:40:49,336 --> 00:40:50,953
"Ji".

1144
00:40:51,066 --> 00:40:53,376
I'm so sick and tired of it.

1145
00:40:53,377 --> 00:40:55,275
- All right. - It's boring.

1146
00:40:55,276 --> 00:40:56,505
(That's enough.)

1147
00:40:56,506 --> 00:40:58,175
- I'm sick of it. - Leave.

1148
00:40:58,176 --> 00:40:59,315
(There's no point in listening.)

1149
00:40:59,316 --> 00:41:01,235
- I'm sick of it. - There's "min".

1150
00:41:01,577 --> 00:41:02,930
- There's "min". - Forget it.

1151
00:41:02,986 --> 00:41:04,400
- I'm sick of it. - "Min" remains.

1152
00:41:04,986 --> 00:41:06,516
- Kwang Soo. - I'll go.

1153
00:41:06,517 --> 00:41:07,800
- All right. - Great.

1154
00:41:07,917 --> 00:41:08,997
"Shin".

1155
00:41:10,287 --> 00:41:11,538
Shin Jimin...

1156
00:41:11,886 --> 00:41:13,056
"Ji".

1157
00:41:13,057 --> 00:41:14,207
Protect her.

1158
00:41:15,627 --> 00:41:17,126
(She's speechless.)

1159
00:41:17,127 --> 00:41:18,379
She's the one that serves and protects.

1160
00:41:18,727 --> 00:41:20,036
He's eliminated.

1161
00:41:20,037 --> 00:41:22,258
(She's firm on eliminating him.)

1162
00:41:23,236 --> 00:41:24,436
You're eliminated.

1163
00:41:24,437 --> 00:41:26,831
- It's terrible. - It's terrible.

1164
00:41:27,276 --> 00:41:29,064
She's Level Five. This is a rare opportunity.

1165
00:41:29,247 --> 00:41:30,458
Can you do it with "Shin Jimin"?

1166
00:41:30,647 --> 00:41:32,696
Shin Jimin looks very smart.

1167
00:41:33,877 --> 00:41:36,686
(You look very smart.)

1168
00:41:36,687 --> 00:41:38,060
- "Ji". - You seem intelligent.

1169
00:41:40,256 --> 00:41:41,974
(That's quite good.)

1170
00:41:42,557 --> 00:41:44,072
- "Min". - Who's Minister of Civil Affairs?

1171
00:41:45,187 --> 00:41:46,826
- "Min". - Who's Minister of Civil Affairs?

1172
00:41:46,827 --> 00:41:49,625
(Minister of Civil Affairs?)

1173
00:41:50,127 --> 00:41:51,295
I'm asking you.

1174
00:41:51,296 --> 00:41:52,695
Do you know who the Minister of Civil Affairs is?

1175
00:41:52,696 --> 00:41:54,465
(It's a new type of acrostic poem.)

1176
00:41:54,466 --> 00:41:56,366
(Everyone is satisfied with it.)

1177
00:41:56,367 --> 00:41:57,549
That's funny.

1178
00:41:57,606 --> 00:41:58,876
I approve of it.

1179
00:41:58,877 --> 00:42:00,536
(Se Chan and Ji Min become partners.)

1180
00:42:00,537 --> 00:42:02,465
All right.

1181
00:42:03,276 --> 00:42:05,539
- Aren't you Level One? - Yes.

1182
00:42:05,676 --> 00:42:06,758
All right.

1183
00:42:06,977 --> 00:42:08,431
How about this, Seok Jin?

1184
00:42:08,517 --> 00:42:10,001
Choose one of the three rooms.

1185
00:42:10,086 --> 00:42:11,904
Go inside one of them.

1186
00:42:12,046 --> 00:42:13,815
- Three of you stand by the door. - Is it random?

1187
00:42:13,816 --> 00:42:15,286
- It is random. - That sounds good.

1188
00:42:15,287 --> 00:42:18,387
Seok Jin, go into one of the three rooms.

1189
00:42:18,787 --> 00:42:20,140
This is random.

1190
00:42:20,196 --> 00:42:22,389
It can't be helped if you're the one.

1191
00:42:22,867 --> 00:42:25,065
Please open the door starting with Yu Ri.

1192
00:42:25,066 --> 00:42:26,496
(Yu Ri selects the first door. Will there be Seok Jin?)

1193
00:42:26,497 --> 00:42:32,798
(Yu Ri opens the door.)

1194
00:42:32,877 --> 00:42:34,118
I'm so relieved.

1195
00:42:35,707 --> 00:42:36,876
I'm so relieved.

1196
00:42:36,877 --> 00:42:38,563
She said that she's relieved.

1197
00:42:38,877 --> 00:42:40,045
That's fortunate.

1198
00:42:40,046 --> 00:42:42,370
Two of you will open the door at the same time.

1199
00:42:43,247 --> 00:42:44,246
(Seungri gets selected.)

1200
00:42:44,247 --> 00:42:45,855
Seok Jin got lucky.

1201
00:42:45,856 --> 00:42:49,725
(Seok Jin and Seungri become partners.)

1202
00:42:50,287 --> 00:42:51,485
You're Level Four?

1203
00:42:51,486 --> 00:42:53,195
(Kwang Soo and Yu Ri become partners.)

1204
00:42:53,196 --> 00:42:54,855
(Kwang Soo and Yu Ri become partners.)

1205
00:42:54,856 --> 00:42:56,078
She's Level One.

1206
00:42:58,227 --> 00:43:00,766
Change into your team uniform, and we'll start the race.

1207
00:43:00,767 --> 00:43:01,795
Come on.

1208
00:43:01,796 --> 00:43:03,250
(Final Couples)

1209
00:43:03,566 --> 00:43:06,105
(A quest has been discovered.)

1210
00:43:06,106 --> 00:43:08,376
Everyone, it's a couple game.

1211
00:43:08,377 --> 00:43:10,367
Here's the first mission where you can gain a level.

1212
00:43:13,216 --> 00:43:15,741
The first mission is Balloon, Stop Right There.

1213
00:43:16,687 --> 00:43:19,355
Each couple randomly chooses a pair of shoes.

1214
00:43:19,356 --> 00:43:21,608
They start simultaneously from the opposite side of one another.

1215
00:43:22,827 --> 00:43:24,755
The first couple to...

1216
00:43:24,756 --> 00:43:27,151
pop the other couple's two balloons wins.

1217
00:43:28,097 --> 00:43:29,996
The first place winner gains two levels.

1218
00:43:29,997 --> 00:43:32,266
The second place gains one level.

1219
00:43:32,267 --> 00:43:34,186
(First place winner gains 2, second place winner gains 1.)

1220
00:43:35,066 --> 00:43:39,582
(Tournament Table)

1221
00:43:40,477 --> 00:43:41,920
I'll feel the weight first.

1222
00:43:42,446 --> 00:43:43,487
Goodness.

1223
00:43:44,406 --> 00:43:46,062
- Is one of them heavier? - This one is lighter.

1224
00:43:46,517 --> 00:43:48,076
- Which one? - This one is lighter.

1225
00:43:48,077 --> 00:43:49,500
- Which one? - You choose that one?

1226
00:43:49,617 --> 00:43:51,045
Okay, you grabbed it.

1227
00:43:51,046 --> 00:43:53,106
- She grabbed it, so it's over. - I think this is heavier.

1228
00:43:53,117 --> 00:43:54,198
Let's look inside.

1229
00:43:54,787 --> 00:43:55,969
These are great.

1230
00:43:56,486 --> 00:43:57,568
What about ours?

1231
00:43:57,886 --> 00:43:59,037
Look at this.

1232
00:43:59,156 --> 00:44:00,456
Those are better.

1233
00:44:00,457 --> 00:44:02,213
- Are these bad? - They're okay.

1234
00:44:03,296 --> 00:44:04,496
Ours are better.

1235
00:44:04,497 --> 00:44:06,266
- These are better. - Ours are better.

1236
00:44:06,267 --> 00:44:07,465
- These are better. - Are these bad?

1237
00:44:07,466 --> 00:44:09,122
Which ones are better?

1238
00:44:09,636 --> 00:44:11,020
I think both of them are bad.

1239
00:44:11,136 --> 00:44:12,995
Get ready for Round One.

1240
00:44:13,906 --> 00:44:15,350
- All right. - Let's go.

1241
00:44:15,506 --> 00:44:16,876
- Get ready. - You can do it.

1242
00:44:16,877 --> 00:44:18,017
You can do it.

1243
00:44:18,747 --> 00:44:20,016
(These two have strength and experience.)

1244
00:44:20,017 --> 00:44:21,246
(Will Seok Jin and Seungri win?)

1245
00:44:21,247 --> 00:44:22,385
Let's start right away.

1246
00:44:22,386 --> 00:44:24,616
(Or will Kwang Soo and Yu Ri win?)

1247
00:44:24,617 --> 00:44:25,930
Start.

1248
00:44:27,986 --> 00:44:28,996
We'll win.

1249
00:44:30,156 --> 00:44:31,425
(They must catch up with the other couple.)

1250
00:44:31,426 --> 00:44:32,525
It's good.

1251
00:44:32,526 --> 00:44:34,345
Take long steps.

1252
00:44:35,227 --> 00:44:38,025
(Going in circles)

1253
00:44:38,566 --> 00:44:39,635
Goodness.

1254
00:44:39,636 --> 00:44:41,151
Straw shoes are a bit quicker.

1255
00:44:42,236 --> 00:44:44,065
(Kwang Soo and Yu Ri chase after them.)

1256
00:44:44,066 --> 00:44:45,366
We're faster.

1257
00:44:45,367 --> 00:44:46,589
We're faster.

1258
00:44:47,037 --> 00:44:48,235
We almost caught up.

1259
00:44:48,236 --> 00:44:51,405
(Seok Jin and Seungri are at risk and almost caught.)

1260
00:44:51,406 --> 00:44:53,376
(Thud)

1261
00:44:53,377 --> 00:44:54,528
We caught them.

1262
00:44:54,877 --> 00:44:56,416
Come on.

1263
00:44:56,417 --> 00:44:59,686
(Let's catch up to them.)

1264
00:44:59,687 --> 00:45:00,827
Goodness.

1265
00:45:00,917 --> 00:45:02,215
- No. - Get them.

1266
00:45:02,216 --> 00:45:03,255
- Go. - Hurry.

1267
00:45:03,256 --> 00:45:04,585
- Keep going. - Hurry.

1268
00:45:04,586 --> 00:45:06,142
Hurry up.

1269
00:45:06,796 --> 00:45:08,514
We're almost there.

1270
00:45:08,756 --> 00:45:11,896
(Yu Ri and Kwang Soo are right behind them.)

1271
00:45:11,897 --> 00:45:13,195
- What do we do? - We're almost there.

1272
00:45:13,196 --> 00:45:14,536
They almost caught them.

1273
00:45:14,537 --> 00:45:17,263
(Where are you going?)

1274
00:45:17,437 --> 00:45:19,706
(They will catch up to them soon.)

1275
00:45:19,707 --> 00:45:21,596
(The first balloon is popped.)

1276
00:45:22,207 --> 00:45:26,721
(If they pop one more, Seok Jin and Seungri are eliminated.)

1277
00:45:26,917 --> 00:45:30,725
(Slipping)

1278
00:45:33,017 --> 00:45:34,885
- What's going on? - Let's go.

1279
00:45:34,886 --> 00:45:36,255
- I don't know. - Hurry.

1280
00:45:36,256 --> 00:45:38,056
(He falls down again at a crucial moment.)

1281
00:45:38,057 --> 00:45:39,915
- Hey, get up. - Let's go.

1282
00:45:40,627 --> 00:45:41,655
It's so slippery.

1283
00:45:41,656 --> 00:45:42,695
(The couple can't control their bodies.)

1284
00:45:42,696 --> 00:45:44,096
- Hurry. - Go.

1285
00:45:44,097 --> 00:45:45,784
It's such a chaos.

1286
00:45:46,437 --> 00:45:47,577
- They caught them. - Hey.

1287
00:45:48,167 --> 00:45:50,436
(Slipping)

1288
00:45:50,437 --> 00:45:51,866
My goodness.

1289
00:45:51,867 --> 00:45:54,335
(They fall for the 3rd time.)

1290
00:45:54,336 --> 00:45:55,476
You can still do it.

1291
00:45:55,477 --> 00:45:57,294
Hurry up and go.

1292
00:45:57,406 --> 00:45:58,416
Hurry up.

1293
00:45:58,647 --> 00:45:59,916
(Legs, keep moving and save me.)

1294
00:45:59,917 --> 00:46:01,116
My goodness.

1295
00:46:01,117 --> 00:46:02,127
Let's go now.

1296
00:46:02,787 --> 00:46:04,085
Be careful.

1297
00:46:04,086 --> 00:46:05,158
It's so slippery.

1298
00:46:05,716 --> 00:46:08,413
(Panting)

1299
00:46:08,986 --> 00:46:11,987
(We won't miss them this time.)

1300
00:46:12,957 --> 00:46:15,795
(Popping)

1301
00:46:16,367 --> 00:46:17,596
Okay.

1302
00:46:17,597 --> 00:46:20,161
(They clear the last balloon.)

1303
00:46:20,597 --> 00:46:21,596
Okay.

1304
00:46:21,597 --> 00:46:23,806
(Kwang Soo and Yu Ri win.)

1305
00:46:23,807 --> 00:46:24,965
It's so difficult.

1306
00:46:24,966 --> 00:46:28,340
(They're exhausted.)

1307
00:46:28,937 --> 00:46:30,005
(We burnt everything.)

1308
00:46:30,006 --> 00:46:31,492
- We won. - Next round is...

1309
00:46:31,606 --> 00:46:34,346
Jong Kook and Ji Hyo versus So Min and Jong Hyun.

1310
00:46:34,347 --> 00:46:35,346
We're up next.

1311
00:46:35,347 --> 00:46:36,428
- Is it us? - Yes.

1312
00:46:36,546 --> 00:46:37,596
We're in trouble.

1313
00:46:37,647 --> 00:46:39,186
We're competing against the strongest.

1314
00:46:39,187 --> 00:46:40,197
(Their opponents are Jong Kook and Ji Hyo.)

1315
00:46:40,656 --> 00:46:42,373
I bet Ji Hyo will do well.

1316
00:46:42,957 --> 00:46:43,996
She's quite good.

1317
00:46:45,957 --> 00:46:47,896
(So Min and Jong Hyun wear fur slippers.)

1318
00:46:47,897 --> 00:46:50,465
(Jong Kook and Ji Hyo wear straw shoes.)

1319
00:46:50,466 --> 00:46:51,465
Let's go.

1320
00:46:51,466 --> 00:46:54,295
Do we have to wear gloves while holding hands?

1321
00:46:54,296 --> 00:46:58,206
(The love frog returns.)

1322
00:46:58,207 --> 00:46:59,675
Stop saying nonsense.

1323
00:46:59,676 --> 00:47:01,394
What did So Min say?

1324
00:47:01,707 --> 00:47:02,945
What's wrong with So Min?

1325
00:47:02,946 --> 00:47:04,376
(A warning alert for love frog)

1326
00:47:04,377 --> 00:47:06,134
You guys look great.

1327
00:47:06,377 --> 00:47:07,576
Interlock the fingers.

1328
00:47:07,577 --> 00:47:08,960
Interlocking the fingers is important.

1329
00:47:10,287 --> 00:47:12,580
(On the other hand...)

1330
00:47:12,787 --> 00:47:14,815
This game is already over.

1331
00:47:14,816 --> 00:47:16,342
They're the same.

1332
00:47:16,386 --> 00:47:18,547
This couple looks so strong.

1333
00:47:18,986 --> 00:47:20,556
They're the most overpowered couple.

1334
00:47:20,557 --> 00:47:22,172
(The combination of Jong Kook and Ji Hyo?)

1335
00:47:23,026 --> 00:47:24,425
(So Min and Jong Hyun versus Jong Kook and Ji Hyo)

1336
00:47:24,426 --> 00:47:25,596
I'm nervous.

1337
00:47:25,597 --> 00:47:26,848
Get ready.

1338
00:47:27,196 --> 00:47:28,307
Start.

1339
00:47:29,906 --> 00:47:32,206
Jong Kook will show us how it's done.

1340
00:47:32,207 --> 00:47:33,706
- They're fast. - So Min.

1341
00:47:33,707 --> 00:47:35,576
- So Min. - Look at them.

1342
00:47:35,577 --> 00:47:37,223
- So Min. - Look at So Min.

1343
00:47:38,006 --> 00:47:39,516
(They're hopping.)

1344
00:47:39,517 --> 00:47:40,616
Don't slip.

1345
00:47:40,617 --> 00:47:41,815
So Min.

1346
00:47:41,816 --> 00:47:43,029
Don't slip.

1347
00:47:43,187 --> 00:47:44,545
Jong Hyun.

1348
00:47:44,546 --> 00:47:45,916
Why are you so bad?

1349
00:47:45,917 --> 00:47:46,916
Jong Hyun.

1350
00:47:46,917 --> 00:47:48,502
- Jong Hyun. - Keep going, So Min.

1351
00:47:48,687 --> 00:47:49,755
Don't slip.

1352
00:47:49,756 --> 00:47:51,242
Jong Hyun is terrible.

1353
00:47:51,287 --> 00:47:53,655
Jong Hyun is being dragged by So Min.

1354
00:47:53,656 --> 00:47:55,344
Jong Hyun.

1355
00:47:55,557 --> 00:47:57,546
- Jong Hyun. - I can do it.

1356
00:47:58,926 --> 00:48:00,036
(He only follows So Min.)

1357
00:48:00,037 --> 00:48:01,956
You said that you were confident.

1358
00:48:02,066 --> 00:48:03,683
You said that you can do it well.

1359
00:48:03,736 --> 00:48:05,135
- It's tiring. - So Min.

1360
00:48:05,136 --> 00:48:06,275
Don't slip.

1361
00:48:06,276 --> 00:48:07,476
You're faster.

1362
00:48:07,477 --> 00:48:09,036
- Never mind. - They are faster.

1363
00:48:09,037 --> 00:48:10,259
- That's right. - Jong Hyun.

1364
00:48:10,307 --> 00:48:12,568
They look like slave hunters.

1365
00:48:12,917 --> 00:48:15,442
They look like slave hunters.

1366
00:48:15,617 --> 00:48:17,516
- Seriously. - Hey.

1367
00:48:17,517 --> 00:48:19,537
- They're like slave hunters. - They look really scary.

1368
00:48:19,656 --> 00:48:21,315
Jong Kook is on a hunt right now.

1369
00:48:21,316 --> 00:48:22,315
(Love slaves, stop right there.)

1370
00:48:22,316 --> 00:48:24,686
- Hey. - They're like slave hunters.

1371
00:48:24,687 --> 00:48:25,755
They look really scary.

1372
00:48:25,756 --> 00:48:27,025
I thought they were shooting a Korean historical drama.

1373
00:48:27,026 --> 00:48:29,148
Are you holding real hammers?

1374
00:48:29,327 --> 00:48:30,496
They look frightening.

1375
00:48:30,497 --> 00:48:32,866
(We're going to catch them.)

1376
00:48:32,867 --> 00:48:34,382
- Jong Hyun. - We can do it.

1377
00:48:35,267 --> 00:48:36,266
Ji Hyo.

1378
00:48:36,267 --> 00:48:38,405
(He's worried for her.)

1379
00:48:38,406 --> 00:48:40,699
You look like a real couple.

1380
00:48:40,937 --> 00:48:42,088
You look great.

1381
00:48:42,236 --> 00:48:43,706
- You look good together. - You look great.

1382
00:48:43,707 --> 00:48:45,727
(Slave hunters fall in love while catching slaves.)

1383
00:48:46,517 --> 00:48:49,815
- Interlock your fingers. - Interlock your fingers.

1384
00:48:49,816 --> 00:48:51,867
(We cheer for the slave hunter couple.)

1385
00:48:53,017 --> 00:48:54,485
They're coming.

1386
00:48:54,486 --> 00:48:55,556
Be careful.

1387
00:48:55,557 --> 00:48:59,726
(Teasing)

1388
00:48:59,727 --> 00:49:01,255
You can't do that.

1389
00:49:01,256 --> 00:49:02,338
(Disturbing isn't allowed.)

1390
00:49:04,167 --> 00:49:08,135
(Don't you see Ji Hyo behind you?)

1391
00:49:08,136 --> 00:49:09,735
(They're jealous of their romance.)

1392
00:49:09,736 --> 00:49:11,635
Here they come again.

1393
00:49:11,636 --> 00:49:13,036
Let's sing "One Man".

1394
00:49:13,037 --> 00:49:14,187
(Being loud)

1395
00:49:14,406 --> 00:49:20,675
(There's one man who loved you very much)

1396
00:49:20,676 --> 00:49:22,746
(She gets into the song.)

1397
00:49:22,747 --> 00:49:24,161
Stop enjoying it.

1398
00:49:26,216 --> 00:49:27,499
Stop singing along and skate.

1399
00:49:28,287 --> 00:49:31,556
(She starts singing love songs instead of chasing.)

1400
00:49:31,557 --> 00:49:32,971
He feels shy.

1401
00:49:33,727 --> 00:49:35,695
He's blushing.

1402
00:49:35,696 --> 00:49:37,080
(They tease Jong Kook and Ji Hyo.)

1403
00:49:38,497 --> 00:49:39,849
Hurry up, So Min.

1404
00:49:40,696 --> 00:49:41,807
It's so difficult.

1405
00:49:41,937 --> 00:49:44,128
- It's a fight of stamina. - It's so difficult.

1406
00:49:44,236 --> 00:49:45,519
Keep going.

1407
00:49:46,077 --> 00:49:47,175
This is how...

1408
00:49:47,176 --> 00:49:48,955
(Goodness)

1409
00:49:50,207 --> 00:49:52,024
- You're doing a good job. - Hurry.

1410
00:49:53,916 --> 00:49:56,581
(What will be the fate of So Min?)

1411
00:49:56,761 --> 00:49:57,871
This is how...

1412
00:49:58,307 --> 00:50:00,124
- You're doing a good job. - Hurry.

1413
00:50:02,416 --> 00:50:05,658
(Slave hunters chase after them faster than ever.)

1414
00:50:05,660 --> 00:50:06,943
Here they come.

1415
00:50:07,306 --> 00:50:08,689
They smelled blood.

1416
00:50:08,905 --> 00:50:10,320
They smelled blood.

1417
00:50:10,905 --> 00:50:11,975
(So Min laid out a bait.)

1418
00:50:11,976 --> 00:50:13,592
- Oh, no. - Here they come.

1419
00:50:14,076 --> 00:50:16,185
(Jong Kook and Ji Hyo take the bait.)

1420
00:50:16,186 --> 00:50:17,498
Here they come.

1421
00:50:17,646 --> 00:50:19,070
They smelled blood.

1422
00:50:19,186 --> 00:50:20,599
(The predator couple arrives.)

1423
00:50:21,655 --> 00:50:22,785
Stop right there.

1424
00:50:22,786 --> 00:50:24,055
(Stop right there.)

1425
00:50:24,056 --> 00:50:25,524
(Falling)

1426
00:50:25,525 --> 00:50:26,555
We got it.

1427
00:50:26,556 --> 00:50:27,637
(Falling)

1428
00:50:27,956 --> 00:50:29,308
We got it.

1429
00:50:29,596 --> 00:50:30,979
- Wait. - Come on.

1430
00:50:32,496 --> 00:50:35,134
(What will be the fate of So Min's team?)

1431
00:50:35,135 --> 00:50:37,234
(Popping)

1432
00:50:37,235 --> 00:50:38,975
Keep going.

1433
00:50:38,976 --> 00:50:40,705
Keep going. You must go.

1434
00:50:40,706 --> 00:50:41,944
You must keep going.

1435
00:50:41,945 --> 00:50:43,259
(Popping)

1436
00:50:43,545 --> 00:50:45,004
Love won.

1437
00:50:45,005 --> 00:50:47,602
(They catch the slaves in love.)

1438
00:50:48,545 --> 00:50:49,645
It's okay.

1439
00:50:49,646 --> 00:50:50,685
(Good job.)

1440
00:50:50,686 --> 00:50:52,070
We tried our best.

1441
00:50:52,916 --> 00:50:54,314
Love won.

1442
00:50:54,315 --> 00:50:55,424
(Jong Kook and Ji Hyo couple wins.)

1443
00:50:55,425 --> 00:50:57,524
- The power of love. - Love is great.

1444
00:50:57,525 --> 00:51:00,725
(Jong Kook and Ji Hyo enter the semifinal.)

1445
00:51:00,726 --> 00:51:02,665
Next is Se Chan and Jimin versus...

1446
00:51:02,666 --> 00:51:04,816
- Haha and MinA. Get ready. - Okay.

1447
00:51:05,025 --> 00:51:06,064
We can do it.

1448
00:51:06,065 --> 00:51:07,611
Wait, MinA.

1449
00:51:07,965 --> 00:51:09,723
- Where's MinA's manager? - Why?

1450
00:51:10,206 --> 00:51:12,398
She's wearing her helmet like this.

1451
00:51:12,536 --> 00:51:15,161
Teach her how to wear it correctly.

1452
00:51:16,646 --> 00:51:18,059
She's so cute.

1453
00:51:19,016 --> 00:51:20,964
I never saw that before.

1454
00:51:22,346 --> 00:51:23,932
Let's go. Do you have strong endurance?

1455
00:51:24,085 --> 00:51:25,185
Get ready.

1456
00:51:25,186 --> 00:51:26,498
(Haha and MinA versus Se Chan and Jimin)

1457
00:51:29,326 --> 00:51:30,424
I don't know who will win.

1458
00:51:30,425 --> 00:51:31,584
They're good.

1459
00:51:31,585 --> 00:51:32,825
(A competition between...)

1460
00:51:32,826 --> 00:51:34,125
(Se Chan with strong legs and sly Haha)

1461
00:51:34,126 --> 00:51:35,524
Haha, you don't need to run.

1462
00:51:35,525 --> 00:51:37,265
(Slipping)

1463
00:51:37,266 --> 00:51:39,995
(MinA slides as soon as they start.)

1464
00:51:39,996 --> 00:51:41,006
Come here.

1465
00:51:41,295 --> 00:51:42,935
- That's not allowed. - You can't do that.

1466
00:51:42,936 --> 00:51:46,308
(She falls for the second time.)

1467
00:51:49,146 --> 00:51:50,620
Keep going.

1468
00:51:50,846 --> 00:51:52,765
(She hugs her balloon.)

1469
00:51:52,846 --> 00:51:54,075
What's going on?

1470
00:51:54,076 --> 00:51:55,314
(She's never seen someone like her before.)

1471
00:51:55,315 --> 00:51:57,770
Keep going forward.

1472
00:51:57,916 --> 00:51:59,185
Why are you coming to me?

1473
00:51:59,186 --> 00:52:00,515
Get up.

1474
00:52:00,516 --> 00:52:03,586
(Dragging)

1475
00:52:03,686 --> 00:52:04,955
Keep going.

1476
00:52:04,956 --> 00:52:06,325
Keep going forward.

1477
00:52:06,326 --> 00:52:08,649
(Popping)

1478
00:52:08,896 --> 00:52:11,325
(Running away)

1479
00:52:11,326 --> 00:52:12,834
- He abandoned her. - You can't leave her.

1480
00:52:12,835 --> 00:52:14,412
- You can't let go of her hand. - You can't leave her.

1481
00:52:14,596 --> 00:52:16,504
MinA, you must get up.

1482
00:52:16,505 --> 00:52:18,705
Give me some time to get up.

1483
00:52:18,706 --> 00:52:20,805
Stop talking and go, MinA.

1484
00:52:20,806 --> 00:52:22,104
- Start. - Let's go.

1485
00:52:22,105 --> 00:52:24,145
1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2.

1486
00:52:24,146 --> 00:52:26,015
This is so scary.

1487
00:52:26,016 --> 00:52:27,375
Who are you?

1488
00:52:27,376 --> 00:52:28,456
Who are you?

1489
00:52:28,815 --> 00:52:31,442
- Are you a celebrity? - I am.

1490
00:52:33,355 --> 00:52:35,084
"Are you a celebrity"?

1491
00:52:35,085 --> 00:52:36,325
- It's over. - Who are you?

1492
00:52:36,326 --> 00:52:37,537
- MinA gave up. - Are you a celebrity?

1493
00:52:39,956 --> 00:52:41,055
Okay.

1494
00:52:41,056 --> 00:52:43,424
(The last balloon pops.)

1495
00:52:43,425 --> 00:52:44,865
(Se Chan and Jimin win.)

1496
00:52:44,866 --> 00:52:47,294
That was the worst.

1497
00:52:47,295 --> 00:52:49,588
- What's wrong with MinA? - MinA can't...

1498
00:52:49,735 --> 00:52:51,250
even walk.

1499
00:52:51,565 --> 00:52:53,375
(What kind of person are you?)

1500
00:52:53,376 --> 00:52:54,634
She's the real deal.

1501
00:52:54,635 --> 00:52:55,918
She's the real deal.

1502
00:52:56,445 --> 00:52:58,875
Next round is Kwang Soo and Yu Ri...

1503
00:52:58,876 --> 00:53:00,145
- versus Jae Seok and Yu Mi. - Yu Mi.

1504
00:53:00,146 --> 00:53:01,245
Okay, it's us.

1505
00:53:01,246 --> 00:53:02,245
Let's go, Yu Mi.

1506
00:53:02,246 --> 00:53:03,584
(Jae Seok and Yu Mi versus Kwang Soo and Yu Ri)

1507
00:53:03,585 --> 00:53:05,908
I expect this round to be a dirty game.

1508
00:53:07,016 --> 00:53:08,515
Do anything to win.

1509
00:53:08,516 --> 00:53:09,685
(Kwang Soo and Yu Ri wear straw shoes.)

1510
00:53:09,686 --> 00:53:10,725
- Let's go. - Let's go.

1511
00:53:10,726 --> 00:53:12,024
- Let's go. - Are they not slippery?

1512
00:53:12,025 --> 00:53:13,095
(Jae Seok and Yu Mi wear fur slippers.)

1513
00:53:13,096 --> 00:53:14,470
Start.

1514
00:53:15,996 --> 00:53:17,064
Let's go.

1515
00:53:17,065 --> 00:53:18,734
- They're fast. - Hold my hand tight.

1516
00:53:18,735 --> 00:53:20,165
It's over if you fall down.

1517
00:53:20,166 --> 00:53:21,234
- Don't fall. - Okay.

1518
00:53:21,235 --> 00:53:23,458
Kwang Soo's torso isn't moving.

1519
00:53:24,266 --> 00:53:27,134
(His torso is stiff.)

1520
00:53:27,135 --> 00:53:30,245
(What's the look on his face?)

1521
00:53:30,246 --> 00:53:31,944
- Kwang Soo. - What's wrong, Kwang Soo?

1522
00:53:31,945 --> 00:53:33,475
Why are you walking like that?

1523
00:53:33,476 --> 00:53:35,940
- He looks like Ki Bong. - It's Ki Bong.

1524
00:53:36,116 --> 00:53:38,984
- It's Ki Bong. - It's Ki Bong.

1525
00:53:38,985 --> 00:53:40,814
(It's Ki Bong's younger brother Kwang Bong.)

1526
00:53:40,815 --> 00:53:42,441
What are you looking at, Kwang Soo?

1527
00:53:42,826 --> 00:53:45,784
Breathe through your nose.

1528
00:53:46,496 --> 00:53:47,637
My feet are freezing.

1529
00:53:49,626 --> 00:53:52,935
- They're coming, Jae Seok. - They're coming.

1530
00:53:52,936 --> 00:53:54,581
They're coming.

1531
00:53:55,335 --> 00:53:56,935
They're coming.

1532
00:53:56,936 --> 00:53:58,219
Turn.

1533
00:53:58,706 --> 00:54:02,645
(They catch up.)

1534
00:54:02,646 --> 00:54:06,050
(They just have to pop the balloons!)

1535
00:54:06,916 --> 00:54:08,245
Good job.

1536
00:54:08,246 --> 00:54:09,630
(Falling)

1537
00:54:10,715 --> 00:54:11,814
(They fail multiple times...)

1538
00:54:11,815 --> 00:54:13,714
(and fall.)

1539
00:54:13,715 --> 00:54:15,015
- Run. - What do we do?

1540
00:54:15,016 --> 00:54:16,484
- Get up. - It's okay.

1541
00:54:16,485 --> 00:54:19,152
- You're safe. - Run.

1542
00:54:19,896 --> 00:54:22,265
(It's a narrow escape.)

1543
00:54:22,266 --> 00:54:23,625
Get up.

1544
00:54:23,626 --> 00:54:26,292
- Hurry up. - Whose toy hammer is this?

1545
00:54:26,436 --> 00:54:28,557
Hold hands.

1546
00:54:28,666 --> 00:54:29,949
Gosh, Yu Ri.

1547
00:54:30,605 --> 00:54:32,104
- Hold hands. - That was close.

1548
00:54:32,105 --> 00:54:34,500
- Gosh, Yu Ri. - You almost had them.

1549
00:54:34,806 --> 00:54:36,805
- Where? - Come to the side.

1550
00:54:36,806 --> 00:54:38,835
Where are you going?

1551
00:54:39,545 --> 00:54:41,162
- Oh, dear. - What are you going?

1552
00:54:41,315 --> 00:54:42,444
Oh, dear.

1553
00:54:42,445 --> 00:54:43,714
(They barely survive and rehydrate themselves.)

1554
00:54:43,715 --> 00:54:46,684
(Kwang Soo gets water splashed on him.)

1555
00:54:47,855 --> 00:54:49,254
(They drink...)

1556
00:54:49,255 --> 00:54:50,884
(some water as well.)

1557
00:54:50,885 --> 00:54:52,654
Why does this game never end?

1558
00:54:52,655 --> 00:54:53,766
(They're exhausted as well.)

1559
00:54:55,456 --> 00:54:58,698
(When does this end?)

1560
00:54:59,695 --> 00:55:00,865
(Let's start over again.)

1561
00:55:00,866 --> 00:55:01,876
They're coming.

1562
00:55:03,135 --> 00:55:04,435
Ki Bong's counterattack.

1563
00:55:04,436 --> 00:55:06,557
(Ki Bong attacks again.)

1564
00:55:07,476 --> 00:55:10,305
(He caught up!)

1565
00:55:10,306 --> 00:55:11,345
Hey.

1566
00:55:11,346 --> 00:55:13,770
(I'll end it this time.)

1567
00:55:15,016 --> 00:55:16,015
Hey.

1568
00:55:16,016 --> 00:55:18,084
(Floundering)

1569
00:55:18,085 --> 00:55:19,115
Hey!

1570
00:55:19,116 --> 00:55:21,509
(Popping)

1571
00:55:21,715 --> 00:55:24,125
(There's one balloon left.)

1572
00:55:24,126 --> 00:55:28,772
(This is a dangerous moment.)

1573
00:55:28,925 --> 00:55:32,369
(They can't run away anymore!)

1574
00:55:33,465 --> 00:55:37,904
(Last pop)

1575
00:55:37,905 --> 00:55:39,652
Oh, dear.

1576
00:55:40,005 --> 00:55:41,104
(They collapse.)

1577
00:55:41,105 --> 00:55:42,145
Good job.

1578
00:55:42,806 --> 00:55:46,109
(That was a great match.)

1579
00:55:48,246 --> 00:55:49,558
We won, Yu Ri.

1580
00:55:49,815 --> 00:55:52,411
Can you call 911?

1581
00:55:52,715 --> 00:55:54,201
We're only Level One right now.

1582
00:55:54,885 --> 00:55:57,725
(She must be exhausted.)

1583
00:55:57,726 --> 00:55:58,924
This is insane.

1584
00:55:58,925 --> 00:56:02,360
(Kwang Soo and Yu Ri advance to the final.)

1585
00:56:03,065 --> 00:56:05,125
- Where is it? - The flag.

1586
00:56:05,126 --> 00:56:07,294
- Get set, ready... - I have to go pee.

1587
00:56:07,295 --> 00:56:09,334
(They're about to start.)

1588
00:56:09,335 --> 00:56:11,991
- This... - Goodness.

1589
00:56:12,306 --> 00:56:14,004
I have to use the bathroom right now.

1590
00:56:14,005 --> 00:56:15,491
Use that urgency to run, Se Chan.

1591
00:56:15,505 --> 00:56:17,604
- I know that feeling. - You need to go.

1592
00:56:17,605 --> 00:56:18,858
It's time.

1593
00:56:19,116 --> 00:56:21,115
Se Chan has to use the bathroom.

1594
00:56:21,116 --> 00:56:23,035
I really have to go.

1595
00:56:24,516 --> 00:56:26,915
(In times like these,)

1596
00:56:26,916 --> 00:56:29,455
(things get complicated even more.)

1597
00:56:29,456 --> 00:56:31,325
(He goes in circles, and he has to go even more now.)

1598
00:56:31,326 --> 00:56:33,125
I feel sorry for you, Se Chan.

1599
00:56:33,126 --> 00:56:34,495
- I know. - Oh, dear.

1600
00:56:34,496 --> 00:56:36,424
- Oh, dear. - Poor Se Chan.

1601
00:56:36,425 --> 00:56:37,725
- Let's go. - Se Chan!

1602
00:56:37,726 --> 00:56:39,935
- They're coming. - They got caught.

1603
00:56:39,936 --> 00:56:41,784
- They're almost there. - Come!

1604
00:56:42,405 --> 00:56:43,964
(Popping)

1605
00:56:43,965 --> 00:56:45,076
They got caught.

1606
00:56:45,635 --> 00:56:47,305
(Gasping)

1607
00:56:47,306 --> 00:56:48,305
Hey.

1608
00:56:48,306 --> 00:56:49,805
- They ran out of energy. - Right.

1609
00:56:49,806 --> 00:56:52,128
They used a lot of energy in the previous game.

1610
00:56:52,175 --> 00:56:55,004
Let's start now!

1611
00:56:55,445 --> 00:56:58,515
Come here, Yu Ri! Come!

1612
00:56:58,516 --> 00:56:59,515
(Does he want to play the finals right away?)

1613
00:56:59,516 --> 00:57:01,615
Come, Yu Ri!

1614
00:57:01,616 --> 00:57:03,877
- Where are you, Yu Ri? - Okay, I'm coming.

1615
00:57:03,925 --> 00:57:06,225
- Hurry up. - Okay, I'm coming.

1616
00:57:06,226 --> 00:57:08,478
- What's going on? - We have to start now. Hurry!

1617
00:57:09,366 --> 00:57:11,365
- While they're tired. - Hurry up.

1618
00:57:11,366 --> 00:57:13,834
- Do we get straw shoes? - Where's the box?

1619
00:57:13,835 --> 00:57:15,634
(I'll pick the shoes. Give me something.)

1620
00:57:15,635 --> 00:57:18,665
- They don't have straw shoes. - We'll go left.

1621
00:57:19,175 --> 00:57:20,875
Get out. Get out!

1622
00:57:20,876 --> 00:57:23,026
(Get out, Se Chan and Jimin!)

1623
00:57:23,876 --> 00:57:25,765
Get out of the rink!

1624
00:57:26,616 --> 00:57:27,915
- Don't go. - Get out.

1625
00:57:27,916 --> 00:57:29,415
- Don't go! - I need to go.

1626
00:57:29,416 --> 00:57:31,484
- Don't go. - Let me go.

1627
00:57:31,485 --> 00:57:32,814
Don't go.

1628
00:57:32,815 --> 00:57:35,754
- Start, Kwang Soo! - Don't go.

1629
00:57:35,755 --> 00:57:37,654
- Start right away. - Get started.

1630
00:57:37,655 --> 00:57:40,019
- Take it on your way out. - Okay.

1631
00:57:41,655 --> 00:57:42,665
Ready...

1632
00:57:42,666 --> 00:57:44,141
(The finals start.)

1633
00:57:44,465 --> 00:57:45,834
(Jong Kook and Ji Hyo are the best in Running Man.)

1634
00:57:45,835 --> 00:57:47,452
Jong Kook and Ji Hyo are mad.

1635
00:57:47,766 --> 00:57:49,004
(Kwang Soo and Yu Ri are resolved.)

1636
00:57:49,005 --> 00:57:50,985
If you lose now, it's a disgrace, Kwang Soo.

1637
00:57:52,436 --> 00:57:55,274
(The finals start!)

1638
00:57:55,275 --> 00:57:57,004
My legs don't move.

1639
00:57:57,005 --> 00:57:58,645
That's good. His legs don't move.

1640
00:57:58,646 --> 00:58:01,475
- You have the advantage. - Will they finally lose?

1641
00:58:01,476 --> 00:58:02,915
They're fast though.

1642
00:58:02,916 --> 00:58:04,214
(They still won't lose.)

1643
00:58:04,215 --> 00:58:06,484
(What?)

1644
00:58:06,485 --> 00:58:09,225
- It's Ki Bong! - It's Ki Bong!

1645
00:58:09,226 --> 00:58:10,437
Ki Bong!

1646
00:58:10,925 --> 00:58:12,411
They're coming.

1647
00:58:13,195 --> 00:58:14,811
Kwang Soo.

1648
00:58:15,326 --> 00:58:18,125
We have to win. Run.

1649
00:58:18,126 --> 00:58:20,435
(This is his specialty.)

1650
00:58:20,436 --> 00:58:22,294
They're fast. Kwang Soo is fast.

1651
00:58:22,295 --> 00:58:23,765
(He looks funny, but he's fast.)

1652
00:58:23,766 --> 00:58:25,365
(Kwang Soo chases them down.)

1653
00:58:25,366 --> 00:58:26,475
He's fast.

1654
00:58:26,476 --> 00:58:28,092
- Are you okay? - I'm fine.

1655
00:58:28,105 --> 00:58:29,186
Come here.

1656
00:58:29,646 --> 00:58:31,245
She's mad now.

1657
00:58:31,246 --> 00:58:32,515
(They have no energy left, but they speed up as well.)

1658
00:58:32,516 --> 00:58:33,627
They're coming!

1659
00:58:34,616 --> 00:58:35,615
Kwang Soo.

1660
00:58:35,616 --> 00:58:39,151
Jong Kook and Ji Hyo are mad.

1661
00:58:39,616 --> 00:58:40,884
You're almost there.

1662
00:58:40,885 --> 00:58:42,754
(Kwang Soo and Yu Ri catch up.)

1663
00:58:42,755 --> 00:58:43,765
They caught up.

1664
00:58:45,286 --> 00:58:46,407
Kwang Soo!

1665
00:58:46,826 --> 00:58:47,825
(Kwang Soo and Yu Ri can taste victory!)

1666
00:58:47,826 --> 00:58:49,441
They caught up.

1667
00:58:49,695 --> 00:58:50,725
This is over.

1668
00:58:50,726 --> 00:58:52,564
If you win, you'll be Level Three.

1669
00:58:52,565 --> 00:58:53,575
(If they win, they'll be Level 3 as a couple.)

1670
00:58:53,735 --> 00:58:56,134
(Will the underdogs win?)

1671
00:58:56,135 --> 00:58:58,435
(Hitting)

1672
00:58:58,436 --> 00:58:59,516
What's wrong with this?

1673
00:59:00,175 --> 00:59:03,805
(He hits the balloon with a hammer, but it doesn't pop.)

1674
00:59:03,806 --> 00:59:04,916
This...

1675
00:59:05,246 --> 00:59:06,345
- It didn't pop. - Oh, dear.

1676
00:59:06,346 --> 00:59:07,444
(Why does something like this only happen to Kwang Soo?)

1677
00:59:07,445 --> 00:59:09,032
Why won't it pop?

1678
00:59:09,485 --> 00:59:11,714
(Why is the balloon strong too?)

1679
00:59:11,715 --> 00:59:13,574
Why is the balloon so hard?

1680
00:59:15,385 --> 00:59:18,588
(The balloon is strong like its owner.)

1681
00:59:18,786 --> 00:59:21,924
(They're exhausted.)

1682
00:59:21,925 --> 00:59:23,512
Run.

1683
00:59:23,726 --> 00:59:24,924
Why won't it pop?

1684
00:59:24,925 --> 00:59:25,946
(The unyielding pursuit continues.)

1685
00:59:27,135 --> 00:59:28,194
It popped.

1686
00:59:28,195 --> 00:59:30,054
(The first balloon pops.)

1687
00:59:30,366 --> 00:59:31,404
It's over now.

1688
00:59:31,405 --> 00:59:33,456
- They're so fit. - It popped.

1689
00:59:33,806 --> 00:59:34,904
Run away!

1690
00:59:34,905 --> 00:59:36,805
(Hitting)

1691
00:59:36,806 --> 00:59:38,664
(How dare you...)

1692
00:59:40,346 --> 00:59:42,615
(Kwang Soo provokes him,)

1693
00:59:42,616 --> 00:59:45,245
(and Yu Ri attacks suddenly.)

1694
00:59:45,246 --> 00:59:47,115
Pop it. It worked!

1695
00:59:47,116 --> 00:59:48,714
(Her toy hammer flies away.)

1696
00:59:48,715 --> 00:59:53,271
(The last balloon pops. Kwang Soo and Yu Ri win.)

1697
00:59:53,655 --> 00:59:54,867
I'm relieved.

1698
00:59:55,396 --> 00:59:56,924
- Are you cold? - Yes.

1699
00:59:56,925 --> 01:00:00,936
(Kwang Soo and Yu Ri gain 2 levels. Jong Kook and Ji Hyo gain 1.)

1700
01:00:01,436 --> 01:00:03,990
- I'm relieved they won. - I know. It's a relief.

1701
01:00:04,505 --> 01:00:07,970
Kwang Soo, you're now Level Two.

1702
01:00:08,806 --> 01:00:10,075
Congratulations.

1703
01:00:10,076 --> 01:00:11,245
(He's only Level 2.)

1704
01:00:11,246 --> 01:00:14,276
Yes. I'm finally Level Two!

1705
01:00:14,916 --> 01:00:16,444
This is the beginning!

1706
01:00:16,445 --> 01:00:17,444
(He has a positive attitude.)

1707
01:00:17,445 --> 01:00:19,484
He's still Level Two. After all that.

1708
01:00:19,485 --> 01:00:20,828
Kwang Soo.

1709
01:00:21,355 --> 01:00:24,484
One of you can gain a level.

1710
01:00:24,485 --> 01:00:26,125
Who do you want it to be?

1711
01:00:26,126 --> 01:00:27,125
(Only one of them can advance to the next level.)

1712
01:00:27,126 --> 01:00:28,555
- Do we have to decide now? - Take it.

1713
01:00:28,556 --> 01:00:30,484
(Take it.)

1714
01:00:31,096 --> 01:00:32,564
No.

1715
01:00:32,565 --> 01:00:34,435
- Later on... - You're warm.

1716
01:00:34,436 --> 01:00:35,904
How warm!

1717
01:00:35,905 --> 01:00:37,865
(He's only nice to his woman.)

1718
01:00:37,866 --> 01:00:40,904
- This is fun. - What a warm man!

1719
01:00:40,905 --> 01:00:42,925
Love power!

1721
01:00:49,076 --> 01:00:50,515
It's a full moon.

1722
01:00:50,516 --> 01:00:52,000
It looks real.

1723
01:00:52,485 --> 01:00:54,754
- It's pretty. - It is.

1724
01:00:54,755 --> 01:00:55,896
It's pretty.

1725
01:00:56,385 --> 01:00:58,102
It's so pretty. They made it so well.

1726
01:00:58,655 --> 01:01:02,706
This is the last mission to achieve Level 10.

1727
01:01:02,726 --> 01:01:04,464
It's Level Up: King of Chairs.

1728
01:01:04,465 --> 01:01:05,625
- "King of Chairs"? - "King of Chairs"?

1729
01:01:05,626 --> 01:01:06,634
"King of Chairs"?

1730
01:01:06,635 --> 01:01:08,686
It's a couple race to steal the chairs.

1731
01:01:08,835 --> 01:01:11,604
There are pairs of chairs in various locations...

1732
01:01:11,605 --> 01:01:13,334
with numbers on them.

1733
01:01:13,335 --> 01:01:16,544
You must find the chairs and sit within the designated time.

1734
01:01:16,545 --> 01:01:19,505
If you can't find seats, you'll be eliminated.

1735
01:01:19,516 --> 01:01:20,875
Right away?

1736
01:01:20,876 --> 01:01:22,245
- Yes, right away. - Do chairs...

1737
01:01:22,246 --> 01:01:24,306
- disappear every round? - Oh, my goodness.

1738
01:01:24,715 --> 01:01:27,015
- This... - We have to find chairs to sit on.

1739
01:01:27,016 --> 01:01:29,883
With each round, two chairs will be taken out.

1740
01:01:30,025 --> 01:01:33,995
- Two? - If there's more than one couple,

1741
01:01:34,096 --> 01:01:36,524
the couple whose couple bracelet breaks first...

1742
01:01:36,525 --> 01:01:38,444
has to move on to a different location.

1743
01:01:38,726 --> 01:01:40,535
It's not name tag elimination.

1744
01:01:40,536 --> 01:01:42,095
You have to break the bracelets.

1745
01:01:42,096 --> 01:01:44,660
- Here's an important rule. - What is it?

1746
01:01:44,905 --> 01:01:48,004
With the conclusion of each round, the couples still in the race...

1747
01:01:48,005 --> 01:01:49,805
- will vote. - What?

1748
01:01:49,806 --> 01:01:50,975
They'll vote for a leader.

1749
01:01:50,976 --> 01:01:54,814
The leader can eliminate one of the couples.

1750
01:01:54,815 --> 01:01:57,084
(The leader can eliminate one couple.)

1751
01:01:57,085 --> 01:01:58,984
How many people get eliminated at once then?

1752
01:01:58,985 --> 01:02:00,915
Two couples will get eliminated each round.

1753
01:02:00,916 --> 01:02:02,484
- Two couples? - I see.

1754
01:02:02,485 --> 01:02:04,484
- Because we vote. - Right.

1755
01:02:04,485 --> 01:02:06,895
Each couple will put on the bracelet.

1756
01:02:06,896 --> 01:02:08,725
(The final quest has begun. Please try your best.)

1757
01:02:08,726 --> 01:02:10,325
(There are 7 couples in Round 1.)

1758
01:02:10,326 --> 01:02:11,495
Ready...

1759
01:02:11,496 --> 01:02:13,495
- Which direction do we go? - Start here.

1760
01:02:13,496 --> 01:02:15,617
- Let's go. - Set...

1761
01:02:16,735 --> 01:02:19,104
What's this?

1762
01:02:19,105 --> 01:02:20,975
- I'm scared. - There's one.

1763
01:02:20,976 --> 01:02:22,205
- Where? - There.

1764
01:02:22,206 --> 01:02:23,475
(There's one over there.)

1765
01:02:23,476 --> 01:02:24,604
There's one.

1766
01:02:24,605 --> 01:02:26,245
- There's one. - Where?

1767
01:02:26,246 --> 01:02:28,214
- There's one here. - Go straight.

1768
01:02:28,215 --> 01:02:29,814
(Se Chan and Jimin head for Chair 1.)

1769
01:02:29,815 --> 01:02:31,544
Sit down.

1770
01:02:31,545 --> 01:02:34,384
- Sit down. - Sit.

1771
01:02:34,385 --> 01:02:36,625
Sit. Let's fight.

1772
01:02:36,626 --> 01:02:38,384
Come. Come at me!

1773
01:02:38,385 --> 01:02:39,654
- Keep going. - Where?

1774
01:02:39,655 --> 01:02:42,019
- Give it up. - What's this?

1775
01:02:42,255 --> 01:02:44,650
- We're in trouble. Hurry. - Is this how it goes?

1776
01:02:45,866 --> 01:02:47,754
- Why? - Do you want to fight?

1777
01:02:47,996 --> 01:02:50,435
(So Min and Jong Hyun are after Chair 1.)

1778
01:02:50,436 --> 01:02:52,404
They're fighting.

1779
01:02:52,405 --> 01:02:54,404
Don't do that!

1780
01:02:54,405 --> 01:02:55,875
- No. - Stop it.

1781
01:02:55,876 --> 01:02:57,544
We have no other possibility.

1782
01:02:57,545 --> 01:02:59,162
- No. - Sit down.

1783
01:02:59,516 --> 01:03:01,940
(He uses his long arm to attack from behind.)

1784
01:03:02,376 --> 01:03:04,015
Sit down.

1785
01:03:04,016 --> 01:03:05,415
- Hey. - No.

1786
01:03:05,416 --> 01:03:07,133
- Pull. - No.

1787
01:03:07,215 --> 01:03:09,484
Don't block us!

1788
01:03:09,485 --> 01:03:11,424
(What's the result of this intense fight?)

1789
01:03:11,425 --> 01:03:12,466
No way.

1790
01:03:12,626 --> 01:03:14,024
(Kwang Soo and Yu Ri are looking for another set of chairs.)

1791
01:03:14,025 --> 01:03:15,995
- I should've taken out my insoles. - You have insoles?

1792
01:03:15,996 --> 01:03:18,045
It's too high.

1793
01:03:18,096 --> 01:03:19,734
Why do you have them now?

1794
01:03:19,735 --> 01:03:21,210
- They're so high. - Go.

1795
01:03:21,235 --> 01:03:22,904
- Are there chairs? - They're here!

1796
01:03:22,905 --> 01:03:24,004
(They're here!)

1797
01:03:24,005 --> 01:03:25,924
(They find Chair 2.)

1798
01:03:26,306 --> 01:03:28,475
Sit down!

1799
01:03:28,476 --> 01:03:30,305
(They throw their bodies on Chair 2.)

1800
01:03:30,306 --> 01:03:32,426
- Are there chairs that way? - Yes.

1801
01:03:32,605 --> 01:03:34,015
- What's this? - I can't do this.

1802
01:03:34,016 --> 01:03:36,773
I have to take my insoles out.

1803
01:03:37,116 --> 01:03:38,314
You have insoles?

1804
01:03:38,315 --> 01:03:40,415
(She takes off her insoles, and her competitiveness is on.)

1805
01:03:40,416 --> 01:03:41,567
When did you put them on?

1806
01:03:41,815 --> 01:03:42,825
Throw them out.

1807
01:03:42,826 --> 01:03:44,301
(She's resolved to win.)

1808
01:03:46,255 --> 01:03:47,395
(That's high.)

1809
01:03:47,396 --> 01:03:48,555
Goodness.

1810
01:03:48,556 --> 01:03:50,595
(Good thing she didn't fall.)

1811
01:03:50,596 --> 01:03:52,182
We can't afford to care about anything else.

1812
01:03:54,235 --> 01:03:55,395
You had insoles.

1813
01:03:55,396 --> 01:03:57,205
(She ran this fast with the insoles.)

1814
01:03:57,206 --> 01:03:58,705
I have to use these later.

1815
01:03:58,706 --> 01:03:59,817
(See you later, insoles.)

1816
01:04:00,376 --> 01:04:01,688
Where are they?

1817
01:04:02,036 --> 01:04:03,691
- There are chairs. - There they are.

1818
01:04:04,945 --> 01:04:06,475
(They find Chair 3.)

1819
01:04:06,476 --> 01:04:08,293
- Where? - We have to keep going.

1820
01:04:08,876 --> 01:04:10,532
- Where? - Where are they?

1821
01:04:10,846 --> 01:04:12,602
We're going to get eliminated in Round One.

1822
01:04:12,916 --> 01:04:14,128
Where are they?

1823
01:04:14,385 --> 01:04:15,527
There they are.

1824
01:04:15,556 --> 01:04:16,738
- Where? - There they are.

1825
01:04:17,385 --> 01:04:19,254
- Let's sit. - They're cushions.

1826
01:04:19,255 --> 01:04:20,424
Let's sit.

1827
01:04:20,425 --> 01:04:21,809
(They run 300m and sit on Chair 4.)

1828
01:04:21,956 --> 01:04:23,294
I'm so tired.

1829
01:04:23,295 --> 01:04:24,941
- I almost died. - Me too.

1830
01:04:25,295 --> 01:04:26,850
- There they are. - Let's slow down.

1831
01:04:27,065 --> 01:04:28,307
We're almost there.

1832
01:04:29,135 --> 01:04:30,418
There are two sets.

1833
01:04:31,936 --> 01:04:33,248
There are seats.

1834
01:04:33,675 --> 01:04:35,050
- There are? - Yes.

1835
01:04:35,105 --> 01:04:36,145
- Where? - Hurry up.

1836
01:04:36,146 --> 01:04:37,519
Why are there seats?

1837
01:04:37,605 --> 01:04:39,245
- There are. - Why are there seats?

1838
01:04:39,246 --> 01:04:41,063
There are seats.

1839
01:04:41,116 --> 01:04:42,661
- This is strange. - What's this?

1840
01:04:42,715 --> 01:04:44,230
Are they fighting down there?

1841
01:04:44,916 --> 01:04:46,056
I see.

1842
01:04:46,315 --> 01:04:47,972
They're fighting over chairs.

1843
01:04:48,315 --> 01:04:49,384
Give up.

1844
01:04:49,385 --> 01:04:50,685
We can't.

1845
01:04:50,686 --> 01:04:52,125
I can't.

1846
01:04:52,126 --> 01:04:53,225
You're persistent.

1847
01:04:53,226 --> 01:04:54,408
(It's been 3 minutes.)

1848
01:04:55,355 --> 01:04:57,921
(Jong Hyun tries to ride on Se Chan's back.)

1849
01:04:58,896 --> 01:05:01,258
Hold on. Time out.

1850
01:05:01,496 --> 01:05:02,694
- Time out. - Give it up.

1851
01:05:02,695 --> 01:05:04,305
- Time out. - Give it up.

1852
01:05:04,306 --> 01:05:05,749
That's enough.

1853
01:05:06,135 --> 01:05:07,535
- Leave. - Go.

1854
01:05:07,536 --> 01:05:08,834
(They defend their chairs fervently.)

1855
01:05:08,835 --> 01:05:10,765
Goodbye. Go.

1856
01:05:11,576 --> 01:05:13,060
Where is Seok Jin?

1857
01:05:13,116 --> 01:05:14,415
(They look for a weaker opponent.)

1858
01:05:14,416 --> 01:05:15,931
We have to look for weak people.

1859
01:05:16,516 --> 01:05:17,657
Weak people.

1860
01:05:18,416 --> 01:05:19,555
Why...

1861
01:05:19,556 --> 01:05:20,898
would they waste their energy here?

1862
01:05:21,315 --> 01:05:22,884
(Se Chan defended himself from Jong Hyun.)

1863
01:05:22,885 --> 01:05:24,154
- Did you see that? - I did.

1864
01:05:24,155 --> 01:05:26,316
- Did you see Jong Hyun? - He was so strong.

1865
01:05:26,425 --> 01:05:27,667
He's strong,

1866
01:05:28,025 --> 01:05:29,308
but he doesn't have any skills.

1867
01:05:29,766 --> 01:05:31,038
He just uses his strength.

1868
01:05:31,695 --> 01:05:33,149
He has a strong lower body.

1869
01:05:33,896 --> 01:05:35,248
He got on my back.

1870
01:05:35,366 --> 01:05:36,604
His lower body was strong.

1871
01:05:36,605 --> 01:05:37,746
(He's a generous person who compliments his opponent.)

1872
01:05:38,505 --> 01:05:40,535
I have good legs too, so I fended him off.

1873
01:05:40,536 --> 01:05:42,353
(That was the point of this.)

1874
01:05:42,876 --> 01:05:44,075
People can't withstand that.

1875
01:05:44,076 --> 01:05:46,024
(He's proud of his legs.)

1876
01:05:46,646 --> 01:05:48,714
I beat Jong Hyun. You saw that, right?

1877
01:05:48,715 --> 01:05:50,331
- I did. - He couldn't rip it. We won.

1878
01:05:51,916 --> 01:05:53,128
- Who's that? - Is somebody coming?

1879
01:05:53,485 --> 01:05:54,584
It's Jae Seok.

1880
01:05:54,585 --> 01:05:56,154
Where's Seok Jin by the way?

1881
01:05:56,155 --> 01:05:58,354
(They walk towards Jae Seok's Chair 4.)

1882
01:05:58,355 --> 01:05:59,507
You're here now?

1883
01:05:59,855 --> 01:06:02,351
- Who is it? - You can't be walking.

1884
01:06:02,425 --> 01:06:04,385
- What? - Are you on a date?

1885
01:06:04,896 --> 01:06:06,194
Hey.

1886
01:06:06,195 --> 01:06:08,014
(They were about to pass.)

1887
01:06:08,835 --> 01:06:10,504
(He attacks out of nowhere.)

1888
01:06:10,505 --> 01:06:11,805
- What are you doing? - Hey.

1889
01:06:11,806 --> 01:06:13,234
(Jong Hyun is as sneaky as So Min.)

1890
01:06:13,235 --> 01:06:14,334
This isn't right.

1891
01:06:14,335 --> 01:06:15,634
You should go after Seok Jin.

1892
01:06:15,635 --> 01:06:18,044
- No, go that way. Hurry. - Go that way.

1893
01:06:18,045 --> 01:06:19,615
Jae Seok is Level Zero.

1894
01:06:19,616 --> 01:06:20,875
We're Level Zero.

1895
01:06:20,876 --> 01:06:23,067
This is like taking candy from a child.

1896
01:06:23,246 --> 01:06:24,396
How evil.

1897
01:06:24,516 --> 01:06:25,596
This isn't right.

1898
01:06:25,846 --> 01:06:27,028
This...

1899
01:06:27,355 --> 01:06:29,055
Where's the next one?

1900
01:06:29,056 --> 01:06:30,524
- Here. - There they are.

1901
01:06:30,525 --> 01:06:32,154
- Not this. - No, no.

1902
01:06:32,155 --> 01:06:34,418
- Go. - Yes, leave.

1903
01:06:34,596 --> 01:06:36,515
- Can I have your glove? - Go.

1904
01:06:36,666 --> 01:06:37,825
- Oh, dear. - Go.

1905
01:06:37,826 --> 01:06:39,325
- It ripped. - It did?

1906
01:06:39,326 --> 01:06:40,794
- Oh, dear. - Go.

1907
01:06:40,795 --> 01:06:42,048
- It ripped. - It did.

1908
01:06:42,465 --> 01:06:43,734
It ripped.

1909
01:06:43,735 --> 01:06:45,604
(The bracelet ripped when they were getting up.)

1910
01:06:45,605 --> 01:06:47,555
- You have to move on. - What?

1911
01:06:47,675 --> 01:06:49,494
- It ripped. - When did that happen?

1912
01:06:49,646 --> 01:06:50,904
It ripped.

1913
01:06:50,905 --> 01:06:52,492
We told them to go.

1914
01:06:53,246 --> 01:06:55,075
It ripped as we were getting up.

1915
01:06:55,076 --> 01:06:56,384
It ripped as we were getting up.

1916
01:06:56,385 --> 01:06:57,728
There's one minute left.

1917
01:06:58,146 --> 01:06:59,631
- Jae Seok. - There's no time.

1918
01:06:59,715 --> 01:07:01,015
There's no time.

1919
01:07:01,016 --> 01:07:03,725
- This is not fair. - This isn't it.

1920
01:07:03,726 --> 01:07:04,884
There's no time.

1921
01:07:04,885 --> 01:07:06,325
This happened as we were getting up.

1922
01:07:06,326 --> 01:07:07,609
(They get new bracelets and move on.)

1923
01:07:08,295 --> 01:07:10,265
- I'm relieved. - There's no need to hurry.

1924
01:07:10,266 --> 01:07:11,709
Right?

1925
01:07:12,096 --> 01:07:13,852
- Goodness. - Jae Seok.

1926
01:07:13,936 --> 01:07:16,258
What do we do, Yu Mi?

1927
01:07:16,766 --> 01:07:18,834
I didn't rip it on purpose.

1928
01:07:18,835 --> 01:07:19,886
- It just ripped, right? - Yes.

1929
01:07:20,536 --> 01:07:21,616
That's their fortune.

1930
01:07:21,735 --> 01:07:23,104
We have to hold hands.

1931
01:07:23,105 --> 01:07:24,404
There they are.

1932
01:07:24,405 --> 01:07:25,516
We have to rip it.

1933
01:07:25,675 --> 01:07:26,845
(They'll get eliminated if they don't rip a bracelet.)

1934
01:07:26,846 --> 01:07:28,057
- They're coming. Hold on. - They're coming.

1935
01:07:28,176 --> 01:07:29,388
Get ready, everybody.

1936
01:07:29,515 --> 01:07:30,585
We're in trouble.

1937
01:07:30,586 --> 01:07:31,684
They're coming.

1938
01:07:31,685 --> 01:07:33,455
Hide it.

1939
01:07:33,456 --> 01:07:34,697
They're passing by.

1940
01:07:34,855 --> 01:07:37,149
Hold on. They're going for the male-male couple.

1941
01:07:37,685 --> 01:07:39,154
(They don't even look at Jong Kook and Ji Hyo.)

1942
01:07:39,155 --> 01:07:40,755
(They're impenetrable.)

1943
01:07:40,756 --> 01:07:42,425
- What are you doing? - What's wrong?

1944
01:07:42,426 --> 01:07:44,865
- Why? - What are you doing?

1945
01:07:44,866 --> 01:07:47,087
- What's this? - We can't stop, Yu Mi.

1946
01:07:47,166 --> 01:07:48,564
Seungri.

1947
01:07:48,565 --> 01:07:50,205
This is a mess.

1948
01:07:50,206 --> 01:07:51,378
We can't let them.

1949
01:07:51,765 --> 01:07:53,575
Seungri, break theirs.

1950
01:07:53,576 --> 01:07:55,152
- Where? - Oh, gosh.

1951
01:07:55,336 --> 01:07:56,386
Oh, dear.

1952
01:07:56,405 --> 01:07:59,204
10, 9, 8...

1953
01:07:59,845 --> 01:08:03,926
(A desperate struggle to survive)

1954
01:08:05,015 --> 01:08:06,184
3,

1955
01:08:06,185 --> 01:08:08,484
- It ripped. - 2, 1.

1956
01:08:08,485 --> 01:08:09,885
- It ripped. - It's over.

1957
01:08:09,886 --> 01:08:11,198
(Round 1 is over.)

1958
01:08:11,286 --> 01:08:12,354
It's over.

1959
01:08:12,355 --> 01:08:16,524
(Did Jae Seok rip the bracelet in the last second?)

1960
01:08:16,525 --> 01:08:17,625
Did you rip it?

1961
01:08:17,626 --> 01:08:19,865
(Is it really ripped?)

1962
01:08:19,866 --> 01:08:22,087
(Seok Jin and Seungri's bracelet is fine.)

1963
01:08:22,765 --> 01:08:23,835
They didn't rip it.

1964
01:08:23,836 --> 01:08:25,784
(He thought it was ripped.)

1965
01:08:25,805 --> 01:08:27,421
- Goodness. - That startled me.

1966
01:08:27,775 --> 01:08:30,330
- We can't do anything else, Yu Mi. - Jae Seok.

1967
01:08:30,405 --> 01:08:33,879
- The leader can be anybody. - It's dangerous for us.

1968
01:08:33,916 --> 01:08:35,259
They'll pick us.

1969
01:08:36,116 --> 01:08:37,684
I say Haha. He's better.

1970
01:08:37,685 --> 01:08:39,433
We don't have an option,

1971
01:08:40,286 --> 01:08:42,235
so let's ask Haha for a favor.

1972
01:08:42,716 --> 01:08:43,968
I say Se Chan.

1973
01:08:44,456 --> 01:08:47,253
- What do you say? - I say Se Chan as well.

1974
01:08:47,326 --> 01:08:49,554
- Se Chan will eliminate So Min. - Right.

1975
01:08:49,555 --> 01:08:50,980
Who do you want to pick?

1976
01:08:51,195 --> 01:08:53,388
- I say Se Chan and Jimin as well. - Okay.

1977
01:08:53,866 --> 01:08:55,149
We'll pick Seok Jin.

1978
01:08:56,166 --> 01:08:58,256
We'll appoint him as the leader.

1979
01:08:58,565 --> 01:08:59,849
- Final. - Yes.

1980
01:09:00,076 --> 01:09:01,974
(The voting has concluded. Please gather at the headquarters.)

1981
01:09:01,975 --> 01:09:03,662
Everybody, Jae Seok and Yu Mi...

1982
01:09:03,905 --> 01:09:05,259
got eliminated...

1983
01:09:05,506 --> 01:09:07,745
in this round.

1984
01:09:07,746 --> 01:09:09,785
- I can't believe this. - Jae Seok is Level Zero.

1985
01:09:09,786 --> 01:09:11,014
(Jae Seok is Level 0.)

1986
01:09:11,015 --> 01:09:13,712
- He's Level 0. - We've been doing this for 4 weeks.

1987
01:09:13,756 --> 01:09:15,354
- He's not even Level 1. - We started as Level 1,

1988
01:09:15,355 --> 01:09:16,467
but he's zero now.

1989
01:09:16,525 --> 01:09:18,184
We played so many games.

1990
01:09:18,185 --> 01:09:20,495
This should be one of the world's mysteries.

1991
01:09:20,496 --> 01:09:21,625
- Does this make sense? - It doesn't.

1992
01:09:21,626 --> 01:09:24,049
- We started as Level 1 4 weeks ago. - What did you do?

1993
01:09:24,095 --> 01:09:26,865
You talk like your level is really high.

1994
01:09:26,866 --> 01:09:28,064
That's not what I meant.

1995
01:09:28,065 --> 01:09:29,965
- It's fascinating. - I...

1996
01:09:29,966 --> 01:09:32,035
Look. Once this game is over,

1997
01:09:32,036 --> 01:09:34,429
I'll show you how I win...

1998
01:09:34,636 --> 01:09:36,505
with Yu Mi's Level Six.

1999
01:09:36,506 --> 01:09:37,705
(He's all talk.)

2000
01:09:37,706 --> 01:09:40,415
- That's... - I met a good partner.

2001
01:09:40,416 --> 01:09:41,588
I'll see.

2002
01:09:41,645 --> 01:09:46,230
The leader couple you voted for...

2003
01:09:46,815 --> 01:09:47,927
Who are they?

2004
01:09:48,286 --> 01:09:49,514
Please.

2005
01:09:49,515 --> 01:09:53,465
(The leaders have the power to eliminate a couple.)

2006
01:09:54,055 --> 01:09:55,711
Seok Jin and Seungri.

2007
01:09:57,395 --> 01:09:58,982
(Seok Jin and Seungri are the leaders of Round 1.)

2008
01:09:59,366 --> 01:10:03,064
(They got 3 votes and got elected as the leaders.)

2009
01:10:03,065 --> 01:10:04,722
- You know who, right? - Of course.

2010
01:10:05,065 --> 01:10:06,247
We know.

2011
01:10:06,506 --> 01:10:07,804
(High levels get anxious.)

2012
01:10:07,805 --> 01:10:09,249
Seok Jin and Seungri,

2013
01:10:09,376 --> 01:10:11,875
pick a number...

2014
01:10:11,876 --> 01:10:14,573
(Pick a number to eliminate.)

2015
01:10:14,676 --> 01:10:16,115
- Number? - from 1 to 6...

2016
01:10:16,116 --> 01:10:17,245
- to eliminate. - What?

2017
01:10:17,246 --> 01:10:19,085
- Cushion number? - Where we sat?

2018
01:10:19,086 --> 01:10:20,631
I think it's where we sat.

2019
01:10:20,685 --> 01:10:22,302
- You don't get to pick? - The number?

2020
01:10:22,655 --> 01:10:24,255
- We had to memorize it. - You know where we sat.

2021
01:10:24,256 --> 01:10:25,599
- I know. - You do.

2022
01:10:27,395 --> 01:10:29,617
We have to eliminate So Min...

2023
01:10:29,695 --> 01:10:31,543
- or Haha. - Yes.

2024
01:10:32,025 --> 01:10:34,295
Please pick a number.

2025
01:10:34,296 --> 01:10:35,694
- What number? - Should we say it together?

2026
01:10:35,695 --> 01:10:36,865
In 1, 2, 3.

2027
01:10:36,866 --> 01:10:37,934
- Number 4! - 4!

2028
01:10:37,935 --> 01:10:39,076
- Who was 4? - 4.

2029
01:10:39,805 --> 01:10:40,974
Who's that?

2030
01:10:40,975 --> 01:10:42,274
Four.

2031
01:10:42,275 --> 01:10:43,474
(The couple who sat on Chair 4 is...)

2032
01:10:43,475 --> 01:10:45,375
So Min and Jong Hyun are eliminated.

2033
01:10:45,376 --> 01:10:48,344
(The couple with the highest level is out.)

2034
01:10:48,676 --> 01:10:50,115
We heard.

2035
01:10:50,116 --> 01:10:51,745
We heard you fight.

2036
01:10:51,746 --> 01:10:53,806
- He remembered. - We heard you fight.

2037
01:10:54,586 --> 01:10:56,524
- We heard you fight. - You did, right?

2038
01:10:56,525 --> 01:10:57,724
Kwang Soo.

2039
01:10:57,725 --> 01:10:59,054
(Jae Seok and Yu Mi, and Jong Hyun and So Min are out.)

2040
01:10:59,055 --> 01:11:00,594
Let's start Round Two...

2041
01:11:00,595 --> 01:11:02,194
with the remaining couples.

2042
01:11:02,195 --> 01:11:03,984
There are four sets of chairs.

2043
01:11:04,466 --> 01:11:06,455
Let's go ahead with Round Two. Get ready.

2044
01:11:06,765 --> 01:11:08,988
Ready, set...

2045
01:11:11,666 --> 01:11:12,716
Run!

2046
01:11:13,376 --> 01:11:14,617
We can't take that one.

2047
01:11:14,706 --> 01:11:16,766
There's none.

2048
01:11:17,506 --> 01:11:19,944
(There are 2 less chairs with each round.)

2049
01:11:19,945 --> 01:11:21,575
- Where is it? - Where is it?

2050
01:11:21,576 --> 01:11:22,875
Is that it?

2051
01:11:22,876 --> 01:11:24,734
- There it is. - There it is. Run.

2052
01:11:26,586 --> 01:11:28,684
- Sit. - I'm going to die.

2053
01:11:28,685 --> 01:11:30,140
(Haha and MinA take Chair 4.)

2054
01:11:30,225 --> 01:11:31,337
I'm going to die.

2055
01:11:32,426 --> 01:11:34,224
Come. Rip it.

2056
01:11:34,225 --> 01:11:35,842
Come here.

2057
01:11:37,126 --> 01:11:38,125
Let's see.

2058
01:11:38,126 --> 01:11:39,764
(Seok Jin and Seungri attack as well.)

2059
01:11:39,765 --> 01:11:41,194
Don't come!

2060
01:11:41,195 --> 01:11:44,165
(There are 3 couples for 1 chair!)

2061
01:11:45,065 --> 01:11:46,277
Let's work together.

2062
01:11:46,435 --> 01:11:47,774
Yu Ri, let's rip Seok Jin's.

2063
01:11:47,775 --> 01:11:48,987
(He tries to make an alliance.)

2064
01:11:49,905 --> 01:11:51,604
(The male-male couple gets scared...)

2065
01:11:51,605 --> 01:11:54,144
(and retreats.)

2066
01:11:54,145 --> 01:11:55,488
- There's a seat left. - What?

2067
01:11:55,515 --> 01:11:56,900
There's a seat left.

2068
01:11:56,916 --> 01:11:58,098
Is there?

2069
01:12:00,685 --> 01:12:03,513
(Yu Ri became more fierce after she took off the insoles.)

2070
01:12:03,555 --> 01:12:04,925
You're going to get eliminated anyway.

2071
01:12:04,926 --> 01:12:06,238
(She attacks endlessly.)

2072
01:12:06,426 --> 01:12:07,594
- Haha. - Think carefully.

2073
01:12:07,595 --> 01:12:09,524
(There's an intense competition.)

2074
01:12:09,525 --> 01:12:10,707
Let go.

2075
01:12:11,265 --> 01:12:12,495
- No! - Here it is.

2076
01:12:12,496 --> 01:12:13,594
(The remaining couples sit down.)

2077
01:12:13,595 --> 01:12:14,694
Sit down.

2078
01:12:14,695 --> 01:12:15,878
(The remaining couples sit down.)

2079
01:12:16,036 --> 01:12:17,705
It's one minute before the conclusion of the race.

2080
01:12:17,706 --> 01:12:19,064
(There's only 1 minute left!)

2081
01:12:19,065 --> 01:12:20,147
No!

2082
01:12:21,136 --> 01:12:24,105
- No! - It ripped.

2083
01:12:24,275 --> 01:12:26,023
- I ripped it. - We ripped it.

2084
01:12:27,046 --> 01:12:29,715
(She rips the bracelet off.)

2085
01:12:29,716 --> 01:12:30,797
Get out.

2086
01:12:30,886 --> 01:12:32,285
- I ripped it. - We're sorry.

2087
01:12:32,286 --> 01:12:34,085
- Move. - Sorry.

2088
01:12:34,086 --> 01:12:35,115
Get off.

2089
01:12:35,116 --> 01:12:36,854
I ripped it.

2090
01:12:36,855 --> 01:12:38,054
(She got more skilled after she took off the insoles.)

2091
01:12:38,055 --> 01:12:39,137
Get out.

2092
01:12:39,225 --> 01:12:40,894
Move. These are our seats.

2093
01:12:40,895 --> 01:12:42,067
(There's no time, and they have no energy.)

2094
01:12:42,695 --> 01:12:44,024
(Thanks to Yu Ri, Kwang Soo and Yu Ri take Chair 4.)

2095
01:12:44,025 --> 01:12:45,024
Goodbye.

2096
01:12:45,025 --> 01:12:47,295
- Let's go. - That was humiliating.

2097
01:12:47,296 --> 01:12:48,635
(They head over to the other chairs.)

2098
01:12:48,636 --> 01:12:49,948
We have to rip a bracelet.

2099
01:12:50,105 --> 01:12:53,205
Six seconds until the race is over.

2100
01:12:53,206 --> 01:12:54,575
- We have to do it. - 5,

2101
01:12:54,576 --> 01:12:57,175
- 4... - No, MinA.

2102
01:12:57,176 --> 01:12:59,075
- 2, 1. - It's okay, Haha.

2103
01:12:59,076 --> 01:13:00,545
- We'll do better next time. - I'm sorry.

2104
01:13:00,546 --> 01:13:02,274
(Haha and MinA have been eliminated. Please pick new leaders.)

2105
01:13:02,275 --> 01:13:03,415
- We pick... - Se Chan.

2106
01:13:03,416 --> 01:13:05,285
- Se Chan and Jimin. - Jimin.

2107
01:13:05,286 --> 01:13:06,955
(According to the votes,)

2108
01:13:06,956 --> 01:13:08,415
(Se Chan and Jimin get elected as the leaders.)

2109
01:13:08,416 --> 01:13:09,854
In 1, 2, 3.

2110
01:13:09,855 --> 01:13:10,967
- 3! - 3!

2111
01:13:11,525 --> 01:13:12,666
- 3. - 3.

2112
01:13:12,826 --> 01:13:14,325
Jong Kook and Ji Hyo are eliminated.

2113
01:13:14,326 --> 01:13:15,495
They're out.

2114
01:13:15,496 --> 01:13:16,594
(They were sitting on Chair 3, so they're out.)

2115
01:13:16,595 --> 01:13:18,365
If we win another round, we can earn a point.

2116
01:13:18,366 --> 01:13:19,894
- This is doable. - That's amazing.

2117
01:13:19,895 --> 01:13:21,855
The strong ones are gone.

2118
01:13:22,296 --> 01:13:23,965
The best couple is out.

2119
01:13:23,966 --> 01:13:25,434
We had to make that decision.

2120
01:13:25,435 --> 01:13:26,617
They would have eliminated us.

2121
01:13:26,805 --> 01:13:29,604
This is the final round.

2122
01:13:29,735 --> 01:13:32,231
There are two chairs left.

2123
01:13:32,775 --> 01:13:34,735
We'll go first.

2124
01:13:34,975 --> 01:13:36,785
Get ready.

2125
01:13:36,786 --> 01:13:38,344
- We should walk slowly. - I know.

2126
01:13:38,345 --> 01:13:39,444
- It doesn't matter either way. - Seriously.

2127
01:13:39,445 --> 01:13:41,115
- We should go first. - We are bound to meet.

2128
01:13:41,116 --> 01:13:42,165
We are bound to meet.

2129
01:13:42,855 --> 01:13:43,984
- We can walk slowly. - Hey!

2130
01:13:43,985 --> 01:13:45,024
- You said we should walk slowly! - Hey!

2131
01:13:45,025 --> 01:13:46,755
- You said we should walk slowly! - For goodness' sake!

2132
01:13:46,756 --> 01:13:47,955
(Didn't they say they will go slowly?)

2133
01:13:47,956 --> 01:13:49,325
For goodness' sake.

2134
01:13:49,326 --> 01:13:50,394
(Did you really trust us?)

2135
01:13:50,395 --> 01:13:53,224
Hey, Se Chan. Let's hurry up.

2136
01:13:53,225 --> 01:13:54,564
(They run and run...)

2137
01:13:54,565 --> 01:13:57,595
(and reach Chair 5 and 6.)

2138
01:13:58,666 --> 01:14:00,393
- There are two chairs. - Which one should we pick?

2139
01:14:01,876 --> 01:14:03,644
- Let's sit here. - Okay.

2140
01:14:03,645 --> 01:14:05,160
(Kwang Soo and Yu Ri sit on Chair 6.)

2141
01:14:06,506 --> 01:14:08,193
Put your hand in your pocket.

2142
01:14:09,546 --> 01:14:10,885
(Approaching)

2143
01:14:10,886 --> 01:14:12,431
Hurry up and sit down.

2144
01:14:13,185 --> 01:14:16,415
(They circle around Kwang Soo and Yu Ri.)

2145
01:14:16,416 --> 01:14:18,748
(They suddenly change their direction...)

2146
01:14:19,685 --> 01:14:22,524
(and walk towards Kwang Soo and Yu Ri.)

2147
01:14:22,525 --> 01:14:23,764
- Are you going to get us? - Of course not.

2148
01:14:23,765 --> 01:14:24,764
- We just want to talk. - Hurry up...

2149
01:14:24,765 --> 01:14:26,425
- and sit down. - We have a suggestion.

2150
01:14:26,426 --> 01:14:27,835
When Seok Jin sits down,

2151
01:14:27,836 --> 01:14:29,335
help us break his couple bracelet.

2152
01:14:29,336 --> 01:14:31,304
Then we will make sure you place first.

2153
01:14:31,305 --> 01:14:33,053
Will we be able to break it? Wouldn't it be better to sit down?

2154
01:14:33,876 --> 01:14:35,117
There it is.

2155
01:14:35,975 --> 01:14:37,764
- Why didn't you sit? - Seriously.

2156
01:14:37,975 --> 01:14:38,974
What are you doing?

2157
01:14:38,975 --> 01:14:40,045
We have time.

2158
01:14:40,046 --> 01:14:41,615
- We have time. - That's right.

2159
01:14:41,616 --> 01:14:42,944
Is that why you didn't sit down?

2160
01:14:42,945 --> 01:14:44,936
(Are they going to break his bracelet?)

2161
01:14:45,985 --> 01:14:48,314
(Se Chan attacks Seok Jin and Seungri.)

2162
01:14:48,315 --> 01:14:50,354
We can place 2nd and you can place 1st.

2163
01:14:50,355 --> 01:14:51,755
(That can happen if you break Kwang Soo's bracelet.)

2164
01:14:51,756 --> 01:14:53,085
- We are serious. - What?

2165
01:14:53,086 --> 01:14:55,495
- Hold on. We are serious. - Really?

2166
01:14:55,496 --> 01:14:56,778
- Let's go. - Okay.

2167
01:14:56,926 --> 01:14:58,465
- Hold on. - Let's go over there.

2168
01:14:58,466 --> 01:14:59,694
Let's go.

2169
01:14:59,695 --> 01:15:00,694
Are you going to attack us?

2170
01:15:00,695 --> 01:15:02,281
- Don't do that. - Hey, I will help you.

2171
01:15:02,666 --> 01:15:04,835
(The tables are turned.)

2172
01:15:04,836 --> 01:15:05,965
We will help you!

2173
01:15:05,966 --> 01:15:07,274
We will really help you!

2174
01:15:07,275 --> 01:15:09,274
(They need to fend off four people.)

2175
01:15:09,275 --> 01:15:10,790
The race will end in a minute.

2176
01:15:11,475 --> 01:15:13,915
(It's the end for us if our bracelet breaks.)

2177
01:15:13,916 --> 01:15:15,915
- Se Chan, we can work together. - Break it.

2178
01:15:15,916 --> 01:15:16,996
Break it.

2179
01:15:18,345 --> 01:15:19,932
It broke! Se Chan's bracelet broke!

2180
01:15:20,485 --> 01:15:23,081
(It broke! Se Chan's bracelet broke!)

2181
01:15:23,886 --> 01:15:25,755
(Se Chan's bracelet breaks with less than a minute remaining.)

2182
01:15:25,756 --> 01:15:27,224
Se Chan's bracelet broke.

2183
01:15:27,225 --> 01:15:28,625
- It broke. - It broke.

2184
01:15:28,626 --> 01:15:29,854
- Did it break? - Our bracelet is intact.

2185
01:15:29,855 --> 01:15:31,512
- Our bracelet is intact. - Se Chan's bracelet broke.

2186
01:15:31,866 --> 01:15:33,495
His bracelet broke.

2187
01:15:33,496 --> 01:15:35,152
(The end of Se Chan)

2188
01:15:35,296 --> 01:15:36,635
- Okay. - Okay.

2189
01:15:36,636 --> 01:15:37,734
Okay.

2190
01:15:37,735 --> 01:15:38,865
We did it.

2191
01:15:38,866 --> 01:15:40,804
They tried to break our bracelet, but theirs broke instead.

2192
01:15:40,805 --> 01:15:42,274
Okay.

2193
01:15:42,275 --> 01:15:44,404
Now, the couple that got eliminated last,

2194
01:15:44,405 --> 01:15:46,375
Se Chan and Jimin...

2195
01:15:46,376 --> 01:15:48,514
will rank the two couples.

2196
01:15:48,515 --> 01:15:49,545
- Yes! - What?

2197
01:15:49,546 --> 01:15:51,101
(Se Chan and Jimin will rank the two couples.)

2198
01:15:51,716 --> 01:15:53,045
(They get the right to choose which couple places 1st and 2nd.)

2199
01:15:53,046 --> 01:15:54,328
Jimin, come here.

2200
01:15:54,956 --> 01:15:56,500
This is nice.

2201
01:15:56,985 --> 01:15:58,097
Let's think about what happened earlier.

2202
01:15:58,485 --> 01:16:00,414
Gosh, this is a difficult choice to make.

2203
01:16:00,695 --> 01:16:03,094
Both Kwang Soo and Seok Jin are my enemies.

2204
01:16:03,095 --> 01:16:04,365
Which couple will place first?

2205
01:16:04,366 --> 01:16:06,789
(Kwang Soo and Yuri's levels are lower.)

2206
01:16:07,235 --> 01:16:08,609
- Kwang Soo and Yuri! - Yes!

2207
01:16:08,866 --> 01:16:10,064
We need an equilibrium.

2208
01:16:10,065 --> 01:16:11,264
(Kwang Soo and Yuri place 1st.)

2209
01:16:11,265 --> 01:16:12,764
We need an equilibrium.

2210
01:16:12,765 --> 01:16:13,847
Okay. Okay.

2211
01:16:14,176 --> 01:16:15,575
They will be Level Five.

2212
01:16:15,576 --> 01:16:17,075
We had no choice.

2213
01:16:17,076 --> 01:16:18,075
Okay.

2214
01:16:18,076 --> 01:16:19,675
(The final level)

2215
01:16:19,676 --> 01:16:22,075
We will now choose the final winner...

2216
01:16:22,076 --> 01:16:23,644
of Level Up Project.

2217
01:16:23,645 --> 01:16:25,503
This is your last chance to make a comeback,

2218
01:16:25,815 --> 01:16:28,455
The Last Roulette.

2219
01:16:28,456 --> 01:16:31,789
(The very last quest, The Last Roulette)

2220
01:16:32,025 --> 01:16:36,094
Running Man members will receive name stickers...

2221
01:16:36,095 --> 01:16:39,358
in accordance with the couple's combined levels.

2222
01:16:39,525 --> 01:16:43,764
The one with the highest level will choose the slots first.

2223
01:16:43,765 --> 01:16:45,180
We will spin the roulette once.

2224
01:16:45,905 --> 01:16:48,505
The member who gets chosen...

2225
01:16:48,506 --> 01:16:50,021
will be the final winner.

2226
01:16:50,275 --> 01:16:53,245
That member's partner will receive a prize.

2227
01:16:53,246 --> 01:16:54,559
- Okay. - Okay.

2228
01:16:54,716 --> 01:16:57,543
Jong Kook and Ji Hyo will receive name stickers...

2229
01:16:57,685 --> 01:16:59,736
in accordance with their combined levels.

2230
01:16:59,985 --> 01:17:02,054
- If they win, - What happens then?

2231
01:17:02,055 --> 01:17:03,844
they will choose whether to stay together...

2232
01:17:05,025 --> 01:17:06,224
(They feel embarrassed for no reason.)

2233
01:17:06,225 --> 01:17:07,694
- This could be the new beginning. - It's just the wording.

2234
01:17:07,695 --> 01:17:09,645
So that I can be with you

2235
01:17:09,895 --> 01:17:11,915
"So that I can be with you"?

2236
01:17:12,366 --> 01:17:15,294
(So that you can have my levels)

2237
01:17:15,695 --> 01:17:17,264
(Love blooms as they exchange levels.)

2238
01:17:17,265 --> 01:17:18,604
- What? - Now,

2239
01:17:18,605 --> 01:17:21,202
you will get name stickers.

2240
01:17:21,475 --> 01:17:23,705
Jae Seok didn't do anything,

2241
01:17:23,706 --> 01:17:25,245
but he will get six name stickers...

2242
01:17:25,246 --> 01:17:26,745
thanks to his partner.

2243
01:17:26,746 --> 01:17:28,144
(He rides on Yu Mi's coattails.)

2244
01:17:28,145 --> 01:17:30,065
Yu Mi is my savior.

2245
01:17:30,815 --> 01:17:32,045
Yu Mi helped me.

2246
01:17:32,046 --> 01:17:33,955
What would you have done without Yu Mi?

2247
01:17:33,956 --> 01:17:36,014
We can go after them, right?

2248
01:17:36,015 --> 01:17:37,654
(So Min and Jong Hyuk put the stickers first.)

2249
01:17:37,655 --> 01:17:39,807
- There are 10. - You either put them together...

2250
01:17:40,025 --> 01:17:41,224
or spread them out.

2251
01:17:41,225 --> 01:17:42,925
Will you put them together or spread them out?

2252
01:17:42,926 --> 01:17:44,465
It's better to put them together.

2253
01:17:44,466 --> 01:17:45,840
Right, So Min?

2254
01:17:46,626 --> 01:17:48,818
- Skip a slot. - That's right.

2255
01:17:50,336 --> 01:17:52,558
- Let's skip a slot. - Okay.

2256
01:17:52,666 --> 01:17:55,104
Shall we put one here?

2257
01:17:55,105 --> 01:17:56,651
- Put it there. - Here?

2258
01:17:56,805 --> 01:17:57,944
Let's spread them out.

2259
01:17:57,945 --> 01:17:59,344
- Shall I put one here? - Yes.

2260
01:17:59,345 --> 01:18:02,649
Shall we put one between Haha's stickers?

2261
01:18:03,376 --> 01:18:04,628
Let's go all in.

2262
01:18:04,716 --> 01:18:06,908
- Let's line up all six stickers. - Shall we line them up?

2263
01:18:07,956 --> 01:18:11,158
(Everything depends on this roulette.)

2264
01:18:11,685 --> 01:18:13,372
- All right. - We spin it once.

2265
01:18:13,655 --> 01:18:15,325
- Let's go! - Let's go!

2266
01:18:15,326 --> 01:18:17,365
- Let's go! - Come on!

2267
01:18:17,366 --> 01:18:18,625
What will happen?

2268
01:18:18,626 --> 01:18:19,706
Get ready.

2269
01:18:20,095 --> 01:18:24,835
In 1, 2, 3.

2270
01:18:24,836 --> 01:18:26,165
All right.

2271
01:18:26,166 --> 01:18:27,205
(The roulette begins to spin.)

2272
01:18:27,206 --> 01:18:28,974
Let's go.

2273
01:18:28,975 --> 01:18:31,328
- Who will it be? - It's spinning fast.

2274
01:18:31,445 --> 01:18:33,162
We spent the last four weeks for this moment.

2275
01:18:33,246 --> 01:18:34,314
Please.

2276
01:18:34,315 --> 01:18:37,214
(Level Up Race was the most competitive.)

2277
01:18:37,886 --> 01:18:39,745
(To level up,)

2278
01:18:39,746 --> 01:18:41,184
(they exhausted their bodies...)

2279
01:18:41,185 --> 01:18:43,913
(and energy.)

2280
01:18:44,756 --> 01:18:46,894
(The past 4 weeks were fierce.)

2281
01:18:46,895 --> 01:18:48,795
- A month. - For this...

2282
01:18:48,796 --> 01:18:50,239
- Who will it be? - My goodness.

2283
01:18:50,395 --> 01:18:51,564
Who will it be?

2284
01:18:51,565 --> 01:18:53,024
There is no way of knowing.

2285
01:18:53,025 --> 01:18:54,535
- Ji Hyo. - Ji Hyo.

2286
01:18:54,536 --> 01:18:55,995
- Let me win just this once. - Our stickers are there.

2287
01:18:55,996 --> 01:18:57,564
Red, red.

2288
01:18:57,565 --> 01:18:58,980
- Please, please. - Let me win just this once.

2289
01:18:59,305 --> 01:19:01,175
Red, red, red.

2290
01:19:01,176 --> 01:19:02,804
- All right. - Let me win just this once.

2291
01:19:02,805 --> 01:19:04,205
- Please. - Red.

2292
01:19:04,206 --> 01:19:06,844
Here, here, here, here.

2293
01:19:06,845 --> 01:19:08,375
Here, here, here.

2294
01:19:08,376 --> 01:19:09,844
- Here. - It's at our stickers.

2295
01:19:09,845 --> 01:19:11,115
It's at our stickers.

2296
01:19:11,116 --> 01:19:12,660
- Please. - Come on.

2297
01:19:12,916 --> 01:19:14,501
- Please. - It might be us.

2298
01:19:14,756 --> 01:19:18,825
- It might be us. - Me! Me! Me! Me!

2299
01:19:18,826 --> 01:19:20,795
Come on!

2300
01:19:20,796 --> 01:19:22,554
No, no. It will be us!

2301
01:19:22,555 --> 01:19:24,142
It will be us!

2302
01:19:24,796 --> 01:19:26,094
(Haha and MinA)

2303
01:19:26,095 --> 01:19:27,434
It will be us!

2304
01:19:27,435 --> 01:19:28,748
It will be us!

2305
01:19:29,065 --> 01:19:30,206
No!

2306
01:19:30,435 --> 01:19:31,617
Stop.

2307
01:19:32,866 --> 01:19:36,205
(Haha and MinA)

2308

(No way!)

2312
01:19:55,996 --> 01:19:57,511
How did this happen?

2313
01:19:57,626 --> 01:19:58,825
Jong Kook!

2314
01:19:58,826 --> 01:20:00,365
(Hugging)

2315
01:20:00,366 --> 01:20:01,548
How did this happen?

2316
01:20:02,136 --> 01:20:03,535
What was that?

2317
01:20:03,536 --> 01:20:04,535
(How did it stop at their sticker?)

2318
01:20:04,536 --> 01:20:06,728
Thank goodness we put a sticker there!

2319
01:20:06,935 --> 01:20:08,955
How did this happen?

2320
01:20:09,176 --> 01:20:11,274
They have one sticker in the middle.

2321
01:20:11,275 --> 01:20:12,344
No way.

2322
01:20:12,345 --> 01:20:14,265

- I can't believe it. - You know,

2324
01:20:17,046 --> 01:20:20,550
Jong Kook and Ji Hyo always get the good things.

2325
01:20:21,256 --> 01:20:23,314
- No way! - How did it stop there?

2326
01:20:23,315 --> 01:20:24,770
What is this?

2327
01:20:25,626 --> 01:20:27,554
Didn't the two of you hug...

2328
01:20:27,555 --> 01:20:29,094
just now?

2329
01:20:29,095 --> 01:20:30,166
(I saw it.)

2330
01:20:31,195 --> 01:20:34,569

(We won.)

2334
01:20:47,746 --> 01:20:48,974
We forgot that...

2335
01:20:48,975 --> 01:20:51,269
- they are invincible together. - I thought it would be us.

2336
01:20:51,586 --> 01:20:54,385
