1
00:00:07,041 --> 00:00:10,180
(On a wintry day with the bluest sky...)

2
00:00:10,181 --> 00:00:11,510
Hello. Good morning.

3
00:00:11,511 --> 00:00:12,639
(Is he doing the opening segment alone?)

4
00:00:12,640 --> 00:00:13,979
- Hi. - Hello.

5
00:00:13,980 --> 00:00:15,249
Hi.

6
00:00:15,250 --> 00:00:16,280
(Feeling relaxed since it's the morning)

7
00:00:16,281 --> 00:00:17,735
- Today, - Yes.

8
00:00:17,921 --> 00:00:20,517
the member with the most amount of money will win the race.

9
00:00:21,221 --> 00:00:23,990
Today's race is called the Great War of Money.

10
00:00:23,991 --> 00:00:25,637
(The member with the most money will win today's race.)

11
00:00:25,921 --> 00:00:27,507
I just need to have the most amount of money?

12
00:00:27,631 --> 00:00:31,195
You will carry out a mission with passers-by to get the basic fund.

13
00:00:31,230 --> 00:00:32,917
- A mission with passers-by? - Yes.

14
00:00:32,961 --> 00:00:36,469
You will freely form teams with your members...

15
00:00:36,470 --> 00:00:37,855
to accomplish the mission.

16
00:00:39,241 --> 00:00:41,664
The team with 4 members will acquire 800 dollars.

17
00:00:41,970 --> 00:00:43,439
I must be in the team of four.

18
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:45,460
The team with 2 members will acquire 300 dollars.

19
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:49,343
If you're alone, you will go against another single member.

20
00:00:49,411 --> 00:00:52,916
The winning member gets 150 dollars and the losing member gets 50.

21
00:00:53,281 --> 00:00:54,937
Money, money, money!

22
00:00:55,650 --> 00:00:57,420
(When teams are formed, a mission will be given out.)

23
00:00:57,421 --> 00:00:59,289
I must be in the team with four members.

24
00:00:59,290 --> 00:01:01,483
That means I must join the team with four members.

25
00:01:02,231 --> 00:01:03,230
(Should I gather some members?)

26
00:01:03,231 --> 00:01:04,947
I'm the most certain this member will join me.

27
00:01:05,530 --> 00:01:07,069
We were on the same team the most.

28
00:01:07,070 --> 00:01:08,080
(Let's gather some members.)

29
00:01:08,301 --> 00:01:11,100
(Who is the member that formed teams with Jae Seok the most?)

30
00:01:11,101 --> 00:01:12,959
- Gosh, Se Chan. - Yes, Jae Seok.

31
00:01:13,711 --> 00:01:15,839
You know that you were my first call, right?

32
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:17,355
I do think so.

33
00:01:17,441 --> 00:01:18,539
Where are you, Se Chan?

34
00:01:18,540 --> 00:01:20,127
I'm in Gangnam now.

35
00:01:20,510 --> 00:01:21,561
- Se Chan. - Yes?

36
00:01:21,611 --> 00:01:23,842
We should team up. We should team up.

37
00:01:23,950 --> 00:01:25,769
Who are some members you're thinking of?

38
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:28,412
I don't know what the missions will be.

39
00:01:28,521 --> 00:01:30,919
As for missions with passers-by,

40
00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:32,690
it'd be nice to have someone like Ji Hyo.

41
00:01:32,691 --> 00:01:34,479
Right. We need a lucky member.

42
00:01:34,631 --> 00:01:35,960
Which member should we pick next?

43
00:01:35,961 --> 00:01:37,759
How about Kwang Soo? We can boss him around.

44
00:01:37,760 --> 00:01:38,770
What?

45
00:01:40,131 --> 00:01:41,229
Great idea.

46
00:01:41,230 --> 00:01:43,866
I'm a bit worried that he might betray us.

47
00:01:44,141 --> 00:01:46,089
Kwang Soo is the best to boss around.

48
00:01:46,301 --> 00:01:47,583
It's simple.

49
00:01:47,670 --> 00:01:50,339
Okay. We got it. You, Kwang Soo, Ji Hyo, and me.

50
00:01:50,340 --> 00:01:52,330
- Let's make a team with them. - I love it.

51
00:01:52,810 --> 00:01:54,179
Okay, where should we meet then?

52
00:01:54,180 --> 00:01:56,373
Where am I?

53
00:01:57,521 --> 00:02:00,107
I'm in Cheongdam Neighborhood Park.

54
00:02:01,251 --> 00:02:02,250
(Kwang Soo is calling.)

55
00:02:02,251 --> 00:02:06,890
Hey, our butler is calling me. I'll be there later.

56
00:02:06,891 --> 00:02:09,330
- I'll pick him up on my way there. - Okay, call me.

57
00:02:09,331 --> 00:02:11,725
- I'll get Kwang Soo. - Okay.

58
00:02:12,801 --> 00:02:14,446
- Kwang Soo. - Hello.

59
00:02:14,571 --> 00:02:15,581
You...

60
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:18,189
No one is willing to take you.

61
00:02:18,440 --> 00:02:20,259
- Jae Seok. - I'll let you be in our team.

62
00:02:21,171 --> 00:02:24,241
I think it's the same for you too. I'll let you be...

63
00:02:25,241 --> 00:02:26,580
- Hey. - in my team.

64
00:02:26,581 --> 00:02:29,050
A lot of people are calling me to be in their team.

65
00:02:29,051 --> 00:02:31,373
I thought I was being recruited.

66
00:02:31,421 --> 00:02:33,020
- I... - I got so many calls.

67
00:02:33,021 --> 00:02:35,878
My cellphone battery is 5 percent. I started at 100 percent.

68
00:02:35,991 --> 00:02:37,490
- You only have five percent left? - Yes.

69
00:02:37,491 --> 00:02:38,976
You must not have charged your phone.

70
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:42,463
Stop talking nonsense, and come to Cheongdam Neighborhood Park.

71
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:45,125
Se Chan and I will form a team together.

72
00:02:45,331 --> 00:02:46,846
Don't say it like that. Jae Seok.

73
00:02:47,130 --> 00:02:48,140
Why not?

74
00:02:48,500 --> 00:02:50,146
I'm your first.

75
00:02:51,141 --> 00:02:54,869
(I want to be your first colleague.)

76
00:02:54,870 --> 00:02:56,879
Okay. Meet me there.

77
00:02:56,880 --> 00:02:58,355
- Okay? - I'll be there.

78
00:02:58,410 --> 00:03:00,572
Meet me at Cheongdam Neighborhood Park. Okay.

79
00:03:00,810 --> 00:03:02,467
Hold on. Let me set out now.

80
00:03:02,750 --> 00:03:04,337
Let's get going.

81
00:03:05,021 --> 00:03:06,161
Gosh, Jae Seok...

82
00:03:06,951 --> 00:03:10,050
He can never say these things to Jong Kook.

83
00:03:10,051 --> 00:03:13,525
He always acts like a boss when he's with us.

84
00:03:14,231 --> 00:03:16,382
I mean, he's coming here. He's not the team leader.

85
00:03:16,791 --> 00:03:18,399
Let's get going first. Okay.

86
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:20,320
(He's badmouthing Jae Seok on TV.)

87
00:03:21,171 --> 00:03:22,629
- Hi. - Hello, Haha.

88
00:03:22,630 --> 00:03:26,206
I sometimes feel comfortable around you, Kwang Soo.

89
00:03:27,310 --> 00:03:30,139
- So Min called me. - Haha. Yes.

90
00:03:30,310 --> 00:03:34,149
- And I talked to Seok Jin too. - Okay.

91
00:03:34,650 --> 00:03:37,520
Se Chan, Seok Jin, So Min, and I...

92
00:03:37,521 --> 00:03:39,904
were going to make a team of four.

93
00:03:41,220 --> 00:03:43,644
But what am I going to do with them?

94
00:03:43,821 --> 00:03:45,920
- Haha. - I don't see a future with them.

95
00:03:45,921 --> 00:03:48,029
We should team up together first.

96
00:03:48,030 --> 00:03:50,959
- I'm in. - With your slyness...

97
00:03:51,030 --> 00:03:53,330
- I'm serious, Haha. - and your dirty plays this time.

98
00:03:53,331 --> 00:03:54,916
Or you and I could...

99
00:03:55,231 --> 00:03:56,482
make a team of four...

100
00:03:57,171 --> 00:03:58,399
and split the money half and half.

101
00:03:58,400 --> 00:03:59,469
(He's playing dirty again.)

102
00:03:59,470 --> 00:04:01,328
You and I can work together.

103
00:04:02,340 --> 00:04:03,439
That's my point.

104
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:05,379
- Hey, Kwang Soo. - Yes.

105
00:04:05,380 --> 00:04:08,450
I'm going to call you DJ today.

106
00:04:08,451 --> 00:04:10,249
(I'm going to call you DJ today.)

107
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:11,719
- DJ? - Yes.

108
00:04:11,720 --> 00:04:12,820
(All of a sudden?)

109
00:04:12,821 --> 00:04:14,204
Because I have a great voice?

110
00:04:14,220 --> 00:04:15,649
You're a dirty jerk.

111
00:04:15,650 --> 00:04:16,833
Haha!

112
00:04:17,660 --> 00:04:19,136
If you say that, I'll be really upset.

113
00:04:20,121 --> 00:04:21,241
Right.

114
00:04:21,860 --> 00:04:23,430
- Right. - Okay.

115
00:04:23,431 --> 00:04:25,460
You're pretty good at things like this.

116
00:04:25,461 --> 00:04:27,318
- Right. - First,

117
00:04:27,501 --> 00:04:30,440
- I'll pick a place. - Okay, okay.

118
00:04:30,441 --> 00:04:33,469
I'll make Se Chan, So Min, and Seok Jin come there.

119
00:04:33,470 --> 00:04:35,289
Okay, Haha. Let's meet.

120
00:04:35,540 --> 00:04:36,752
- Okay. - Okay.

121
00:04:38,881 --> 00:04:41,680
(He's fishing for his prey as soon as he finishes the call.)

122
00:04:41,681 --> 00:04:42,710
My sister-in-law.

123
00:04:42,711 --> 00:04:43,950
(Ji Hyo becomes his sister-in-law.)

124
00:04:43,951 --> 00:04:45,649
You know that I'm pulling for you, right?

125
00:04:45,650 --> 00:04:48,114
- Be good to me. - Of course.

126
00:04:48,220 --> 00:04:50,786
Seeing how things are unfolding,

127
00:04:50,860 --> 00:04:53,921
I think they decided to meet in front of a statue in Dosan Park.

128
00:04:54,660 --> 00:04:57,054
- Is that so? - I'm on my way there too.

129
00:04:57,160 --> 00:04:59,019
Okay, I'll be there too.

130
00:04:59,530 --> 00:05:02,328
We'll meet in front of the statue.

131
00:05:02,530 --> 00:05:04,116
- Should we meet there? - Yes, Seok Jin.

132
00:05:04,340 --> 00:05:05,739
You should come too.

133
00:05:05,740 --> 00:05:07,558
- I'll be there then. - Come meet me there.

134
00:05:07,670 --> 00:05:10,270
- I'll really be there. - I'm going there. I'm not lying.

135
00:05:10,271 --> 00:05:12,140
- I'm on my way now. - I have faith in you, So Min.

136
00:05:12,141 --> 00:05:13,180
Okay.

137
00:05:13,181 --> 00:05:16,510
(Members are heading to where they promised to meet at.)

138
00:05:16,511 --> 00:05:17,793
(Dosan Park and Neighborhood Park)

139
00:05:18,581 --> 00:05:19,719
- Hey, Jae Seok. - Se Chan.

140
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:21,135
Where are you? I'm on my way there.

141
00:05:21,321 --> 00:05:24,460
No, listen. I'm already near Cheongdam Neighborhood Park.

142
00:05:24,461 --> 00:05:25,820
You're here? Where are you?

143
00:05:25,821 --> 00:05:28,457
- Yes, I'm at the park now. - Okay.

144
00:05:28,860 --> 00:05:30,359
Where should we meet then?

145
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:33,967
- Meet me at the entrance. - Okay.

146
00:05:34,170 --> 00:05:35,343
I'll be at the entrance.

147
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:37,169
Where are you, Se Chan?

148
00:05:37,170 --> 00:05:38,469
(Jae Seok gets off at the entrance.)

149
00:05:38,470 --> 00:05:40,692
- Hey. - Wait, Jae Seok. Hello?

150
00:05:40,910 --> 00:05:43,239
Hey, hold on.

151
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:45,332
Are you in the car that's leaving now?

152
00:05:45,540 --> 00:05:47,166
Hold on. Wait.

153
00:05:47,881 --> 00:05:50,649
What do you mean? Hey, hold on.

154
00:05:50,650 --> 00:05:53,680
Did your car turn on the emergency light? Is that you?

155
00:05:53,990 --> 00:05:55,637
- It's not me. I'm not moving. - Hey.

156
00:05:55,751 --> 00:05:56,849
- Hey. - Jae Seok.

157
00:05:56,850 --> 00:05:59,314
That's not true. Your car stopped, but it's leaving now.

158
00:06:00,021 --> 00:06:01,071
Hey.

159
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:03,659
- Hang up. - I can hear Jong Kook laughing.

160
00:06:03,660 --> 00:06:04,859
I'm hanging up.

161
00:06:04,860 --> 00:06:07,430
(The familiar voice belongs to Jong Kook.)

162
00:06:07,431 --> 00:06:09,930
- Hang up. Hang up! - I'm hanging up!

163
00:06:09,931 --> 00:06:11,182
(Why is he in the car?)

164
00:06:12,141 --> 00:06:13,352
Jong Kook called me.

165
00:06:13,540 --> 00:06:15,570
- Hey, Se Chan. - I'll be there right away.

166
00:06:15,571 --> 00:06:17,499
- You know what? - Yes.

167
00:06:18,110 --> 00:06:20,807
You cannot team up with these reckless members.

168
00:06:20,850 --> 00:06:22,250
I won't go there. Don't worry.

169
00:06:22,251 --> 00:06:24,620
- Okay, wait. I know where you live. - I will.

170
00:06:24,621 --> 00:06:26,320
(You know what happens if you betray me, right?)

171
00:06:26,321 --> 00:06:28,815
Come on. Don't say that.

172
00:06:29,391 --> 00:06:31,260
- I know your address. Okay? - I got it. Yes.

173
00:06:31,261 --> 00:06:33,089
- I'll wait for you. - Okay.

174
00:06:33,090 --> 00:06:35,081
- Okay! - Let's get it.

175
00:06:35,691 --> 00:06:38,960
(This is so fun. This is why people betray others.)

176
00:06:38,961 --> 00:06:40,789
No, no. We can't accept a reckless member.

177
00:06:41,331 --> 00:06:44,770
Hey, So Min. Where are you, So Min?

178
00:06:44,771 --> 00:06:46,039
(He's in a hurry.)

179
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:47,370
So Min.

180
00:06:47,371 --> 00:06:49,839
- Where are you, Jae Seok? - Where are you, So Min.

181
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:51,239
I'm near Dosan Park.

182
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:53,776
- So Min. I'll be there. - Yes?

183
00:06:53,881 --> 00:06:56,335
You can't go anywhere right now.

184
00:06:57,081 --> 00:06:58,292
Okay, So Min?

185
00:06:58,951 --> 00:07:00,450
- You've been abandoned. - So Min.

186
00:07:00,451 --> 00:07:03,379
- Hey, So Min. Se Chan... - They got you good.

187
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:06,789
Gosh, he's not decent. He's not a decent human being.

188
00:07:06,790 --> 00:07:09,184
- I see. Okay. - Hey, So Min.

189
00:07:09,290 --> 00:07:12,159
I'm on my way to Dosan Park.

190
00:07:12,660 --> 00:07:16,229
Gosh, seriously. Se Chan.

191
00:07:16,230 --> 00:07:18,169
(Boiling with anger)

192
00:07:18,170 --> 00:07:19,399
I'll teach this jerk a lesson.

193
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:22,098
(I can't believe Se Chan betrayed me.)

194
00:07:22,811 --> 00:07:24,557
- Jae Seok just called me. - Okay.

195
00:07:25,340 --> 00:07:27,098
Hold on. Pick it up.

196
00:07:27,251 --> 00:07:28,290
Let's hear what he says.

197
00:07:28,550 --> 00:07:29,591
Yes, Jae Seok.

198
00:07:30,050 --> 00:07:31,049
Hey, jerk.

199
00:07:31,050 --> 00:07:33,080
- I escaped him right now. - Hey.

200
00:07:33,081 --> 00:07:35,289
You shouldn't live such a dirty life!

201
00:07:35,290 --> 00:07:36,789
- Where are you? I'm free. - You know that?

202
00:07:36,790 --> 00:07:37,919
- Where am I? - I'm serious.

203
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:39,020
I got out. Where are you?

204
00:07:39,021 --> 00:07:41,029
- Do you want me to scold you? - No.

205
00:07:41,030 --> 00:07:43,050
I'm right behind you. You want to know where I am?

206
00:07:45,561 --> 00:07:48,669
(He's at a loss for words.)

207
00:07:48,670 --> 00:07:50,169
(He's talking to him while watching his acting.)

208
00:07:50,170 --> 00:07:51,870
(His acting is priceless.)

209
00:07:51,871 --> 00:07:53,355
Where is he? Is that him?

210
00:07:53,740 --> 00:07:55,270
- What? You got out? - Is that his car?

211
00:07:55,271 --> 00:07:56,969
- The black car. - I'm sorry, Jae Seok.

212
00:07:56,970 --> 00:07:58,810
- You, Jong Kook. - Hey.

213
00:07:58,811 --> 00:08:01,080
You already teamed up with Jong Kook, didn't you?

214
00:08:01,081 --> 00:08:02,710
Hey, Se Chan.

215
00:08:02,711 --> 00:08:05,245
I won't let this slide today.

216
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:07,032
This means war!

217
00:08:07,290 --> 00:08:08,320
It's war!

218
00:08:08,321 --> 00:08:09,620
- Bye! - Tell him again.

219
00:08:09,621 --> 00:08:11,219
(Hanging up)

220
00:08:11,220 --> 00:08:12,403
That jerk, Se Chan.

221
00:08:12,561 --> 00:08:15,722
(Se Chan upset me so much.)

222
00:08:16,790 --> 00:08:19,386
All right. Pay attention.

223
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:21,969
I see a few cars already.

224
00:08:21,970 --> 00:08:23,687
(Are they all here?)

225
00:08:24,670 --> 00:08:28,140
(Ji Hyo, sacrifice number 1, arrives at Dosan Park.)

226
00:08:28,141 --> 00:08:31,810
(Seok Jin, sacrifice number 2, arrives at Dosan Park.)

227
00:08:31,811 --> 00:08:32,979
(Kwang Soo arrives at the park too.)

228
00:08:32,980 --> 00:08:34,121
Where is Haha?

229
00:08:34,951 --> 00:08:36,879
(They'll have a secret rendezvous before meeting the others.)

230
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:37,950
Haha.

231
00:08:37,951 --> 00:08:39,519
- There. There. - Haha.

232
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:41,470
- I'm right here. Get in. - Haha.

233
00:08:41,590 --> 00:08:42,630
- Where are you? - Get in.

234
00:08:43,250 --> 00:08:44,359
Where? Haha.

235
00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:45,759
(They successfully make contact.)

236
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:48,460
(Kwang Soo finds Haha's car at last.)

237
00:08:48,461 --> 00:08:49,572
- Hello, Haha. - Hey, hey.

238
00:08:49,931 --> 00:08:51,446
- This is great. - Haha.

239
00:08:51,661 --> 00:08:53,060
- We should make a team. - You know what?

240
00:08:53,061 --> 00:08:54,717
I have decided.

241
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,800
We should only let the weak ones to get in.

242
00:08:56,801 --> 00:08:59,570
(That way, it's easy to betray them.)

243
00:08:59,571 --> 00:09:00,853
- Let's call So Min first. - I'm serious.

244
00:09:01,270 --> 00:09:02,351
Let's call So Min.

245
00:09:02,711 --> 00:09:04,080
- Let me call Seok Jin. - Okay.

246
00:09:04,081 --> 00:09:05,780
(Seok Jin is as weak as So Min.)

247
00:09:05,781 --> 00:09:07,009
- Haha. - So Min.

248
00:09:07,010 --> 00:09:09,050
I don't know how to get there. Where do I go from the entrance?

249
00:09:09,051 --> 00:09:10,280
Get out of the entrance gate.

250
00:09:10,281 --> 00:09:12,050
Come to where the main road is. Hurry.

251
00:09:12,051 --> 00:09:13,131
Hurry, hurry, hurry.

252
00:09:13,350 --> 00:09:15,249
- Run, run, run, run. - Okay.

253
00:09:15,250 --> 00:09:17,988
We don't have much time. Ask people how to get here.

254
00:09:18,921 --> 00:09:21,011
- Hurry. Run. - Hold on.

255
00:09:21,191 --> 00:09:22,604
Let's run. Run!

256
00:09:22,791 --> 00:09:24,851
- Run. - Hey, hey. Get in here. Hurry.

257
00:09:24,901 --> 00:09:25,941
This way!

258
00:09:26,661 --> 00:09:28,186
Close the door. Close it.

259
00:09:28,730 --> 00:09:30,900
Lock the door. Lock it.

260
00:09:30,901 --> 00:09:32,859
(The trio of reckless members is made with So Min.)

261
00:09:33,100 --> 00:09:34,182
That was hard.

262
00:09:35,110 --> 00:09:36,540
Seok Jin is over there.

263
00:09:36,541 --> 00:09:38,398
We should bring him here. With him, we'll have four people.

264
00:09:39,140 --> 00:09:40,897
Hey, where are you? Where are you?

265
00:09:41,211 --> 00:09:43,775
Where are you? I'm about to go to you.

266
00:09:44,350 --> 00:09:46,150
Hey, Kwang Soo is calling. This is getting out of hand.

267
00:09:46,151 --> 00:09:47,231
Where are you?

268
00:09:48,051 --> 00:09:49,868
- Right now, - Where?

269
00:09:49,921 --> 00:09:52,719
I'm in the parking lot next to Dosan Park.

270
00:09:53,090 --> 00:09:55,586
- What? - The diagonal parking lot.

271
00:09:55,691 --> 00:09:57,560
Here, here! I'm right here!

272
00:09:57,561 --> 00:09:58,945
(Here, here! I'm right here!)

273
00:09:59,860 --> 00:10:01,083
Hey, do we have four people here?

274
00:10:01,370 --> 00:10:02,800
- Hurry. - Do we have four people?

275
00:10:02,801 --> 00:10:03,999
No, no. Come quickly.

276
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:04,999
Do we have four people?

277
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,020
Jong Kook and Se Chan will be here.

278
00:10:07,140 --> 00:10:09,090
Gosh, if I go there, there will be four people.

279
00:10:09,340 --> 00:10:10,910
Hey, if I go there, that will make four people.

280
00:10:10,911 --> 00:10:12,080
Where should I go?

281
00:10:12,081 --> 00:10:13,353
Come here. Quickly.

282
00:10:13,781 --> 00:10:15,550
Jong Kook and Se Chan just have to get here.

283
00:10:15,551 --> 00:10:16,550
(Hold on a second.)

284
00:10:16,551 --> 00:10:18,066
Ji Hyo is calling. Where are you?

285
00:10:18,151 --> 00:10:20,343
- We're almost there. - I'm trying to save you.

286
00:10:20,451 --> 00:10:21,519
- Hey. - Who is that?

287
00:10:21,520 --> 00:10:23,267
- Hey. - Seok Jin. Uncle!

288
00:10:23,921 --> 00:10:25,320
Hey, don't call me Uncle.

289
00:10:25,321 --> 00:10:26,960
- Seok Jin, - Uncle.

290
00:10:26,961 --> 00:10:28,748
we're almost there.

291
00:10:28,890 --> 00:10:31,099
If I go there, that will make a team of four.

292
00:10:31,100 --> 00:10:32,099
Seok Jin.

293
00:10:32,100 --> 00:10:33,359
Wait for a bit. We'll be there soon.

294
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:35,694
We're passing by the theater now.

295
00:10:36,201 --> 00:10:37,599
Gosh, goodness.

296
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:39,599
(Will he get into the dream team with Jong Kook and Ji Hyo?)

297
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:41,761
(Or will he join the reckless ones to make a team of 4 right away?)

298
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:46,509
(Jae Seok is still suffering from Se Chan's betrayal.)

299
00:10:46,510 --> 00:10:47,910
- Kwang Soo. - Jae Seok!

300
00:10:47,911 --> 00:10:49,550
- Where are you? - Hurry, Jae Seok.

301
00:10:49,551 --> 00:10:50,609
- Jae Seok. - Hurry.

302
00:10:50,610 --> 00:10:52,820
- That's Jae Seok? - We just need you to come here.

303
00:10:52,821 --> 00:10:54,841
Okay. Great. The last seat is mine.

304
00:10:55,020 --> 00:10:56,505
Come to the statue.

305
00:10:56,551 --> 00:10:57,600
Okay.

306
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:01,859
(2 vehicles are heading to the park to make a team of 4.)

307
00:11:01,860 --> 00:11:03,129
- We're here. Where are you? - We're here.

308
00:11:03,130 --> 00:11:04,660
- We're here. We got here. - Where are you? We're here.

309
00:11:04,661 --> 00:11:06,300
- They'll make the team first! - We're here.

310
00:11:06,301 --> 00:11:07,430
- We're here. - Okay, we're here.

311
00:11:07,431 --> 00:11:09,087
(Will they make the dream team first?)

312
00:11:09,130 --> 00:11:10,382
There it is. I see you.

313
00:11:12,171 --> 00:11:13,200
There they are.

314
00:11:13,201 --> 00:11:15,109
(Or will the reckless members make a team first?)

315
00:11:15,110 --> 00:11:16,310
There it is. I see you.

316
00:11:16,311 --> 00:11:18,879
(Which team will receive the highest mission fund...)

317
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:24,002
(and start off the War of Money?)

318
00:11:24,081 --> 00:11:25,363
- Where are you? - Where?

319
00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:27,249
Right here!

320
00:11:27,250 --> 00:11:28,450
- Hurry. - Get in.

321
00:11:28,451 --> 00:11:30,510
- Okay! - This is driving me crazy.

322
00:11:30,551 --> 00:11:32,480
- Great! - I got him!

323
00:11:32,661 --> 00:11:34,449
- We made a team of four! - I got him.

324
00:11:34,590 --> 00:11:36,030
- Seok Jin. - We did it.

325
00:11:36,031 --> 00:11:37,759
- Hey. - Jae Seok is behind us.

326
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:39,229
It's a mess over there.

327
00:11:39,230 --> 00:11:40,371
- Did you see that? - Seriously.

328
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:42,229
With four members gathered here,

329
00:11:42,230 --> 00:11:43,800
- Yes. - a team of four has been formed.

330
00:11:43,801 --> 00:11:45,012
- Okay! - Yes!

331
00:11:45,370 --> 00:11:48,137
- 200 dollars! 5 times 4 is 20. - 5 times 4 is 20.

332
00:11:48,610 --> 00:11:50,630
A team of four has been formed, so it's no longer available.

333
00:11:50,781 --> 00:11:52,760
- Seok Jin went there. - He went to that team.

334
00:11:52,980 --> 00:11:54,849
- Really? - You have a team of two or single.

335
00:11:54,850 --> 00:12:00,608
(Now, a team of 2 is available with the next highest mission fund.)

336
00:12:01,151 --> 00:12:02,989
(Haha, let's go for the team of 2.)

337
00:12:02,990 --> 00:12:05,820
(We were supposed to team up from the get-go.)

338
00:12:05,821 --> 00:12:06,932
Jae Seok just called me.

339
00:12:07,730 --> 00:12:09,290
I think Jae Seok will be left alone.

340
00:12:09,291 --> 00:12:10,430
- Team of two! - Come on!

341
00:12:10,431 --> 00:12:12,400
(They betrayed So Min literally behind her back.)

342
00:12:12,401 --> 00:12:13,573
What is this?

343
00:12:14,031 --> 00:12:15,213
A team of two has been formed.

344
00:12:15,331 --> 00:12:17,390
So Min must carry out the mission alone.

345
00:12:17,441 --> 00:12:18,440
Okay!

346
00:12:18,441 --> 00:12:20,440
(Haha and Kwang Soo formed a team of 2.)

347
00:12:20,441 --> 00:12:22,310
(A pair of dirty players)

348
00:12:22,311 --> 00:12:25,080
(So Min will make a team alone.)

349
00:12:25,081 --> 00:12:26,109
Wait!

350
00:12:26,110 --> 00:12:27,251
Everyone, freeze.

351
00:12:27,711 --> 00:12:29,680
- Wait. Everyone, freeze. - What are you saying?

352
00:12:29,681 --> 00:12:31,920
- Jae Seok, it's over. - Jae Seok, you're here!

353
00:12:31,921 --> 00:12:33,580
You and I will have to play alone.

354
00:12:33,581 --> 00:12:35,019
- This is over. - Why?

355
00:12:35,020 --> 00:12:36,150
You and I will be alone.

356
00:12:36,151 --> 00:12:38,786
- Se Chan took Seok Jin. - You're alone.

357
00:12:38,961 --> 00:12:39,960
You should form a team together.

358
00:12:39,961 --> 00:12:41,889
(4-person team: Seok Jin, Jong Kook, Ji Hyo, and Se Chan)

359
00:12:41,890 --> 00:12:43,290
(2-person team: Haha and Kwang Soo)

360
00:12:43,291 --> 00:12:44,412
(Jae Seok and So Min are on their own.)

361
00:12:44,531 --> 00:12:47,056
The mission 4-person team will carry out is...

362
00:12:47,230 --> 00:12:48,670
the group jump rope.

363
00:12:48,671 --> 00:12:49,913
My goodness.

364
00:12:50,770 --> 00:12:52,170
- You must invite... - This is perfect.

365
00:12:52,171 --> 00:12:53,540
- 6 passers-by. - 6 people?

366
00:12:53,541 --> 00:12:55,609
If a total of 10 people skip the jump rope 19 times,

367
00:12:55,610 --> 00:12:57,879
we'll count it as a success.

368
00:12:57,880 --> 00:12:59,053
Six people?

369
00:13:00,510 --> 00:13:02,399
6 people? Hold on. 6?

370
00:13:02,850 --> 00:13:05,650
It won't be easy to invite six passers-by at this time.

371
00:13:05,651 --> 00:13:07,219
- We should get six people. - Okay.

372
00:13:07,220 --> 00:13:08,820
That won't be easy.

373
00:13:08,821 --> 00:13:10,019
- It will be really hard. - Look over there.

374
00:13:10,020 --> 00:13:11,619
- Should we split and conquer? - Yes, let's do that.

375
00:13:11,620 --> 00:13:12,660
Yes, let's split.

376
00:13:12,661 --> 00:13:14,580
- I'll go with Ji Hyo. - Okay, go.

377
00:13:14,730 --> 00:13:16,160
- Let's look for people outdoors. - Okay, Seok Jin.

378
00:13:16,161 --> 00:13:17,430
- Yes. - We can invite a kid too.

379
00:13:17,431 --> 00:13:18,999
- Are you going somewhere? - Are you going somewhere?

380
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,300
She's here to film.

381
00:13:20,301 --> 00:13:22,330
- You're here to film. - I knew it. You looked pretty.

382
00:13:22,331 --> 00:13:24,099
- Hey, hi. - Say hello.

383
00:13:24,100 --> 00:13:25,099
- What do you model for? - What do you do?

384
00:13:25,100 --> 00:13:26,739
- She's here to model in hanbok. - I see.

385
00:13:26,740 --> 00:13:28,124
- Really? - You don't have time, do you?

386
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:29,839
- She probably doesn't have time. - She said she didn't have time.

387
00:13:29,840 --> 00:13:31,410
(They asked just in case.)

388
00:13:31,411 --> 00:13:33,109
(She firmly says no.)

389
00:13:33,110 --> 00:13:34,323
- She said no right away. - She doesn't have time.

390
00:13:35,081 --> 00:13:36,222
- That's too bad. - Okay.

391
00:13:36,551 --> 00:13:37,561
Bye.

392
00:13:37,651 --> 00:13:38,680
- Bye. - Thank you.

393
00:13:38,681 --> 00:13:40,219
- Bye. - Thank you.

394
00:13:40,220 --> 00:13:41,619
Which member is your favorite on Running Man?

395
00:13:41,620 --> 00:13:42,803
Stop it.

396
00:13:42,821 --> 00:13:44,306
(He suddenly asks a question.)

397
00:13:44,421 --> 00:13:46,190
- Stop it. - It's not me, is it?

398
00:13:46,191 --> 00:13:47,290
- I guess it's not me. - Stop it, Grandpa.

399
00:13:47,291 --> 00:13:49,108
- People at your age like me. - Come on.

400
00:13:49,531 --> 00:13:50,672
Come on, Grandpa.

401
00:13:52,100 --> 00:13:53,330
(Someone captured Ji Hyo and Se Chan's attention.)

402
00:13:53,331 --> 00:13:54,816
- Are you good at jump ropes? - Hello.

403
00:13:55,370 --> 00:13:57,369
- Are you good at jump ropes? - Are you good at jump ropes?

404
00:13:57,370 --> 00:13:58,999
I'm sorry, but you have to be good at it.

405
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,616
- She's good. - Really?

406
00:14:01,340 --> 00:14:04,210
(She exudes an unusual aura.)

407
00:14:04,211 --> 00:14:06,280
- Are you good at jump ropes? - She's good.

408
00:14:06,281 --> 00:14:08,580
- We'll do it with a group. - It will take...

409
00:14:08,581 --> 00:14:09,620
some time.

410
00:14:09,980 --> 00:14:10,979
You can go.

411
00:14:10,980 --> 00:14:12,869
- Is she your boss? - Thank you so much!

412
00:14:13,151 --> 00:14:14,320
- Thank you! - She's the manager?

413
00:14:14,321 --> 00:14:15,633
We just got two people.

414
00:14:16,590 --> 00:14:18,509
Jae Seok and So Min. The mission you will carry out is...

415
00:14:18,791 --> 00:14:21,560
2-on-2 bowling match with passers-by.

416
00:14:21,561 --> 00:14:24,115
We'll have a match. If we win, we get 15 dollars.

417
00:14:24,230 --> 00:14:26,229
If we lose, we get 50 dollars for our mission fund.

418
00:14:26,230 --> 00:14:28,554
It'd be nice if you can help us out.

419
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,666
Yong Hyun, where were you going?

420
00:14:31,840 --> 00:14:33,720
I was on a break from my academy.

421
00:14:33,870 --> 00:14:36,239
I came here because I thought this was more important.

422
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:37,453
You're not going to take your next class?

423
00:14:37,610 --> 00:14:38,710
Right now,

424
00:14:38,711 --> 00:14:40,559
- I must enjoy my time. - I see.

425
00:14:40,610 --> 00:14:42,328
- He wants to enjoy the present. - Yes.

426
00:14:43,081 --> 00:14:45,677
- You were going to an academy. - Yes.

427
00:14:45,921 --> 00:14:47,093
But I was late.

428
00:14:47,151 --> 00:14:49,119
You're late. Are you sure you don't have to go?

429
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:50,565
I won't go since I'm late anyway.

430
00:14:50,620 --> 00:14:52,759
- Great. - She's new to bowling.

431
00:14:52,760 --> 00:14:54,478
- You have never bowled before? - Right.

432
00:14:54,630 --> 00:14:56,089
- You've never played it once? - No.

433
00:14:56,090 --> 00:14:58,383
Good luck to both of our teams.

434
00:14:58,561 --> 00:15:00,660
- Let's start now. - We can do it.

435
00:15:00,661 --> 00:15:01,681
All right.

436
00:15:01,901 --> 00:15:03,142
- 1, 2, 3. - 1, 2, 3.

437
00:15:03,171 --> 00:15:04,352
- Let's go! - Let's go!

438
00:15:04,970 --> 00:15:08,170
Han Sol is in good spirits.

439
00:15:08,171 --> 00:15:09,810
(She gets excited.)

440
00:15:09,811 --> 00:15:11,210
Let's do this. Let's go!

441
00:15:11,211 --> 00:15:12,221
Han Sol.

442
00:15:12,411 --> 00:15:13,825
This must be a bit awkward to be here, but...

443
00:15:14,551 --> 00:15:15,965
- You danced. - I saw that.

444
00:15:16,010 --> 00:15:17,970
- I saw it. She gets excited. - She's a bit...

445
00:15:18,220 --> 00:15:19,968
She's a bit similar to So Min.

446
00:15:20,081 --> 00:15:21,589
So Min is the expert at this move.

447
00:15:21,590 --> 00:15:23,489
(How good are the ladies at bowling?)

448
00:15:23,490 --> 00:15:24,719
All right. So Min.

449
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:27,460
(So Min bowls first.)

450
00:15:27,461 --> 00:15:29,190
(Looking serious)

451
00:15:29,191 --> 00:15:30,830
(She bowls the first one.)

452
00:15:30,831 --> 00:15:32,012
No, no!

453
00:15:33,161 --> 00:15:34,629
(It rolls...)

454
00:15:34,630 --> 00:15:37,227
(to the gutter.)

455
00:15:38,041 --> 00:15:41,748
(Gosh, it went to the gutter. Gosh.)

456
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:44,361
(She gets 0 points.)

457
00:15:45,181 --> 00:15:47,680
(He can't bear to watch it.)

458
00:15:47,681 --> 00:15:49,450
(It's Yong Hyun's turn to bowl.)

459
00:15:49,451 --> 00:15:50,592
It's your turn, Yong Hyun.

460
00:15:51,821 --> 00:15:53,219
(He starts calmly...)

461
00:15:53,220 --> 00:15:55,240
(and loses his footing.)

462
00:15:56,020 --> 00:15:59,790
(Is this a deja vu? It goes to the gutter again.)

463
00:15:59,791 --> 00:16:03,264
(They indeed belong to the same team.)

464
00:16:04,191 --> 00:16:05,372
Seriously. That's all right.

465
00:16:05,461 --> 00:16:07,499
Good job. Well done.

466
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:09,319
- The prize made me nervous. - No, no.

467
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:11,139
(Team So Min finished the first frame without any points.)

468
00:16:11,140 --> 00:16:12,670
- I won't remind you. - Okay.

469
00:16:12,671 --> 00:16:13,800
- You know, right? - Yes.

470
00:16:13,801 --> 00:16:15,670
(It's Han Sol's turn to try.)

471
00:16:15,671 --> 00:16:17,327
Good luck, Han Sol!

472
00:16:17,811 --> 00:16:18,850
(Screaming)

473
00:16:19,411 --> 00:16:22,009
(She bowls for the first time in her life with excitement.)

474
00:16:22,010 --> 00:16:23,425
- Wait. - It's going.

475
00:16:24,681 --> 00:16:27,019
(Rolling slowly)

476
00:16:27,020 --> 00:16:28,019
(It rolls very slowly.)

477
00:16:28,020 --> 00:16:29,101
What was that? What?

478
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:32,222
(It knocks down a lot of pins. Nice shot.)

479
00:16:33,390 --> 00:16:35,690
(This bowling newbie is surprisingly good at bowling.)

480
00:16:35,691 --> 00:16:37,960
- Yes! - She danced again.

481
00:16:37,961 --> 00:16:40,253
What was that? What is this?

482
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:44,499
(Since I'm happy, let's shake it.)

483
00:16:44,500 --> 00:16:46,700
(Team Jae Seok has 8 points so far.)

484
00:16:46,701 --> 00:16:48,356
- She didn't even lift it up high. - Why did that go so slowly?

485
00:16:48,711 --> 00:16:50,760
(We might lose at this rate.)

486
00:16:51,380 --> 00:16:52,410
- Hello. Thank you. - Okay.

487
00:16:52,411 --> 00:16:53,639
- This is Team Kwang Soo and Haha. - Hi.

488
00:16:53,640 --> 00:16:54,924
- Please come in. - Hello.

489
00:16:55,110 --> 00:16:57,101
- We're a team. - We're a team.

490
00:16:57,380 --> 00:17:00,350
We have to play the game, 369.

491
00:17:00,821 --> 00:17:02,638
We just need to go over the number 50.

492
00:17:03,191 --> 00:17:04,574
- But... - But...

493
00:17:04,760 --> 00:17:06,033
we clap with numbers that have 3, 6, and 9.

494
00:17:06,560 --> 00:17:09,317
And we have to say, "hurray" with multiples of 10.

495
00:17:09,361 --> 00:17:11,118
If it's 10, you say, "hurray" once.

496
00:17:11,500 --> 00:17:13,247
If it's 20, you say it 2 times.

497
00:17:13,401 --> 00:17:16,400
With that rule, we have to go all the way to 50.

498
00:17:16,401 --> 00:17:17,916
I'm sorry, but please pay attention.

499
00:17:18,070 --> 00:17:20,060
Please don't talk. I would like to ask you not to do that.

500
00:17:20,901 --> 00:17:22,082
We can finish this in one go.

501
00:17:22,671 --> 00:17:25,539
- Start. - 1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 4.

502
00:17:25,540 --> 00:17:27,662
- 369 - 369

503
00:17:27,750 --> 00:17:28,779
- 1. - 2.

504
00:17:28,780 --> 00:17:29,790
- 4. - 5.

505
00:17:30,310 --> 00:17:31,361
- 7. - 8.

506
00:17:31,951 --> 00:17:34,243
- Hurray. - 11, 12.

507
00:17:35,020 --> 00:17:36,203
- 14. - 15.

508
00:17:36,490 --> 00:17:37,561
- 17. - 18.

509
00:17:37,961 --> 00:17:41,223
(Swinging)

510
00:17:42,091 --> 00:17:43,949
- Say "hurray". - "Hurray."

511
00:17:44,401 --> 00:17:47,700
(Swinging in silence is unacceptable.)

512
00:17:47,701 --> 00:17:49,346
You have to say "hurray".

513
00:17:49,671 --> 00:17:50,670
This is our first time.

514
00:17:50,671 --> 00:17:52,100
- We came very far. - Good job.

515
00:17:52,101 --> 00:17:54,910
- We came almost halfway. - Good job.

516
00:17:54,911 --> 00:17:56,309
- It's impressive. - We came almost halfway.

517
00:17:56,310 --> 00:17:57,422
It's impressive.

518
00:17:57,570 --> 00:17:59,055
We finished 40 percent.

519
00:17:59,411 --> 00:18:00,926
- Here we go. - Let's focus a little more.

520
00:18:01,550 --> 00:18:02,590
Start.

521
00:18:02,951 --> 00:18:04,380
1, 2, 3, 4.

522
00:18:04,381 --> 00:18:06,620
- 369 - 369

523
00:18:06,621 --> 00:18:07,620
- 1. - 2.

524
00:18:07,621 --> 00:18:08,832
- 4. - 5.

525
00:18:08,951 --> 00:18:10,000
- 7. - 8.

526
00:18:10,191 --> 00:18:11,776
- Hurray. - 11, 12.

527
00:18:12,260 --> 00:18:13,433
- 14. - 15.

528
00:18:13,691 --> 00:18:14,841
- 17. - 18.

529
00:18:15,091 --> 00:18:16,374
Hurray, hurray.

530
00:18:16,591 --> 00:18:19,160
(She says hurray 2 times.)

531
00:18:19,161 --> 00:18:20,646
- 21. - 22.

532
00:18:21,060 --> 00:18:22,647
- 24. - 25.

533
00:18:23,201 --> 00:18:24,655
- 27. - 28.

534
00:18:25,401 --> 00:18:26,684
Hurray, hurray, hurray.

535
00:18:33,681 --> 00:18:35,166
Hurray, hurray, hurray, hurray.

536
00:18:35,411 --> 00:18:36,966
(Moving up and down)

537
00:18:37,351 --> 00:18:39,049
(I see.)

538
00:18:39,050 --> 00:18:40,090
41.

539
00:18:40,980 --> 00:18:42,668
- He said "hurray". - Wait.

540
00:18:42,921 --> 00:18:44,219
It's his habit.

541
00:18:44,220 --> 00:18:46,690
(He says "hurray" out of habit.)

542
00:18:46,691 --> 00:18:49,489
- Can't we talk to ourselves? - It's his habit.

543
00:18:50,161 --> 00:18:51,499
Can't we talk to ourselves?

544
00:18:51,500 --> 00:18:52,960
(Unfortunately, they fail at number 40.)

545
00:18:52,961 --> 00:18:54,769
How old are you?

546
00:18:54,770 --> 00:18:56,069
- Pardon? - How old are you?

547
00:18:56,070 --> 00:18:57,484
We're the same age.

548
00:18:57,631 --> 00:18:58,812
Shall we speak casually?

549
00:18:59,540 --> 00:19:00,539
Concentrate.

550
00:19:00,540 --> 00:19:02,792
(Concentrate.)

551
00:19:03,270 --> 00:19:05,330
Concentrate. What's wrong?

552
00:19:06,540 --> 00:19:07,579
What's wrong with you?

553
00:19:07,580 --> 00:19:09,110
- You got really into it. - I was nervous.

554
00:19:09,111 --> 00:19:10,424
Were you born in 1985?

555
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:12,279
- You two are friends. - We are.

556
00:19:12,280 --> 00:19:13,719
We have to do well.

557
00:19:13,720 --> 00:19:15,568
It could be our last chance. Believe in yourself.

558
00:19:15,691 --> 00:19:17,049
- Let's go. - Let's cheer.

559
00:19:17,050 --> 00:19:18,360
(Let's cheer, everyone.)

560
00:19:18,361 --> 00:19:19,620
We can do it.

561
00:19:19,621 --> 00:19:21,059
- 1, 2, 3, let's go. - Let's go.

562
00:19:21,060 --> 00:19:22,529
(They have a chance of winning if they concentrate more.)

563
00:19:22,530 --> 00:19:23,540
Let's go.

564
00:19:24,330 --> 00:19:25,412
We're almost there.

565
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:27,360
- Let's go with this. - Good luck.

566
00:19:27,361 --> 00:19:29,930
- 1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 4. - 1, 2, 3, 4.

567
00:19:29,931 --> 00:19:32,170
- 369 - 369

568
00:19:32,171 --> 00:19:33,181
- 1. - 2.

569
00:19:33,270 --> 00:19:34,280
- 4. - 5.

570
00:19:34,570 --> 00:19:35,621
- 7. - 8.

571
00:19:36,070 --> 00:19:37,210
- Hurray. - 11.

572
00:19:37,211 --> 00:19:38,279
12.

573
00:19:38,280 --> 00:19:39,553
- 14. - 15.

574
00:19:39,780 --> 00:19:40,852
- 17. - 18.

575
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:42,320
Hurray, hurray.

576
00:19:42,550 --> 00:19:44,009
(They reach 20.)

577
00:19:44,010 --> 00:19:45,262
- 21. - 22.

578
00:19:45,550 --> 00:19:46,762
- 24. - 25.

579
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:48,634
- 27. - 28.

580
00:19:49,451 --> 00:19:50,703
Hurray, hurray, hurray.

581
00:19:50,951 --> 00:19:53,183
(They reach 30.)

582
00:19:58,730 --> 00:20:00,216
Hurray, hurray, hurray, hurray.

583
00:20:00,830 --> 00:20:03,527
(I reached 40.)

584
00:20:03,730 --> 00:20:06,039
(Will they successfully reach 50?)

585
00:20:06,040 --> 00:20:08,060
- 41. - 42.

586
00:20:09,310 --> 00:20:11,361
- 44. - 45.

587
00:20:13,881 --> 00:20:15,396
- 47. - 48.

588
00:20:16,851 --> 00:20:21,489
(They succeed with 1 clap and hurray of 5 times.)

589
00:20:21,490 --> 00:20:23,219
(He claps once for 49.)

590
00:20:23,220 --> 00:20:26,120
Hurray, hurray, hurray, hurray, hurray.

591
00:20:27,361 --> 00:20:31,744
(They get to 5 hurrays successfully.)

592
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,100
- We got it. - We did it.

593
00:20:34,101 --> 00:20:35,670
We made it.

594
00:20:35,671 --> 00:20:38,269
(The one who concentrated...)

595
00:20:38,270 --> 00:20:40,670
(and the one who helped him concentrate are both impressed.)

596
00:20:40,671 --> 00:20:41,681
Give it to us.

597
00:20:41,770 --> 00:20:44,579
You cleared your mission successfully.

598
00:20:44,580 --> 00:20:45,994
(They earn 300 dollars.)

599
00:20:46,111 --> 00:20:47,840
We did it.

600
00:20:47,841 --> 00:20:50,577
- We'll give you a gift. - Thank you for your work.

601
00:20:50,611 --> 00:20:53,307
- That's great. - Thank you.

602
00:20:53,621 --> 00:20:56,479
- Thank you. - Thank you.

603
00:20:57,091 --> 00:20:59,949
There's something for you.

604
00:21:00,790 --> 00:21:02,759
Please take it.

605
00:21:02,760 --> 00:21:04,559
(They're given a mysterious envelope.)

606
00:21:04,560 --> 00:21:05,700
"Password Chart".

607
00:21:05,701 --> 00:21:06,960
(Password Chart)

608
00:21:06,961 --> 00:21:09,229
- What is it? - "1038".

609
00:21:09,230 --> 00:21:13,299
The password chart shows the address of your next destination.

610
00:21:13,300 --> 00:21:16,169
(Solve the password for your next destination.)

611
00:21:16,540 --> 00:21:17,670
(Being sly)

612
00:21:17,671 --> 00:21:19,440
(He puts it in.)

613
00:21:19,441 --> 00:21:22,783
- Aren't we staying together? - Yes, but we never know.

614
00:21:23,080 --> 00:21:25,319
Is this necessary? Okay.

615
00:21:25,320 --> 00:21:27,150
- Come on. - Do whatever you want.

616
00:21:27,151 --> 00:21:29,789
- Why are you covering it up? - Just take a photo.

617
00:21:29,790 --> 00:21:31,609
(Did you catch me covering it up?)

618
00:21:31,921 --> 00:21:34,860
Solve this password and arrive at your next destination.

619
00:21:34,861 --> 00:21:38,299
Then you'll get a chance to increase the money you gained.

620
00:21:38,300 --> 00:21:40,460
(A chance to increase the money that we gained?)

621
00:21:40,461 --> 00:21:41,969
- However... - Do we have to go together?

622
00:21:41,970 --> 00:21:44,640
It's given to 3 members who arrive 1st.

623
00:21:44,641 --> 00:21:47,200
(It's given to three members who arrive first.)

624
00:21:47,201 --> 00:21:48,469
Only they get the chance.

625
00:21:48,470 --> 00:21:50,561
(Those who arrive first?)

626
00:21:54,010 --> 00:21:55,465
(Grabbing)

627
00:21:57,750 --> 00:21:59,235
(He's good at stealing.)

628
00:21:59,681 --> 00:22:01,740
(Come on, Haha.)

629
00:22:03,290 --> 00:22:06,593
(He chases him already during the day.)

630
00:22:07,591 --> 00:22:08,741
(Dropping)

631
00:22:10,030 --> 00:22:11,242
Goodness, Haha.

632
00:22:11,461 --> 00:22:12,571
Okay.

633
00:22:13,060 --> 00:22:16,900
(He disappeared so quickly with his short legs.)

634
00:22:16,901 --> 00:22:17,981
Haha.

635
00:22:18,500 --> 00:22:20,693
What's wrong with you?

636
00:22:21,201 --> 00:22:23,998
"1038", "131", "45", "L", "B", "L".

637
00:22:25,480 --> 00:22:27,561
I can never solve this.

638
00:22:28,250 --> 00:22:29,392
What could it be?

639
00:22:30,351 --> 00:22:33,482
You have to turn your arm wide. Hit the ground.

640
00:22:34,280 --> 00:22:35,789
1, 2.

641
00:22:35,790 --> 00:22:36,963
- Three. - It's too fast.

642
00:22:37,451 --> 00:22:38,602
Four, that's right.

643
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:39,819
Five.

644
00:22:39,820 --> 00:22:40,860
Six.

645
00:22:40,861 --> 00:22:41,989
Seven.

646
00:22:41,990 --> 00:22:44,229
- Eight. - Look at him.

647
00:22:44,230 --> 00:22:45,240
(He does it in silence.)

648
00:22:45,701 --> 00:22:46,740
Give it to me.

649
00:22:47,131 --> 00:22:49,696
This is how to turn it. Start.

650
00:22:49,830 --> 00:22:52,629
Make it big. 1, 2.

651
00:22:52,701 --> 00:22:54,155
He's teaching again.

652
00:22:54,470 --> 00:22:55,925
He always teaches.

653
00:22:56,411 --> 00:22:58,140
Do it this way. It must be big like this.

654
00:22:58,141 --> 00:23:00,610
Otherwise, the rope gets shorter.

655
00:23:00,611 --> 00:23:02,410
When it's short, people can't go in.

656
00:23:02,411 --> 00:23:04,431
Make it big.

657
00:23:04,750 --> 00:23:07,219
We're grateful that he's helping us.

658
00:23:07,220 --> 00:23:08,789
- Why are you teaching him? - Do it like this.

659
00:23:08,790 --> 00:23:10,507
- Here you go. - Shall we try?

660
00:23:10,550 --> 00:23:12,379
You have to jump 19 times.

661
00:23:13,121 --> 00:23:14,131
Here you go.

662
00:23:14,560 --> 00:23:15,559
You can do it.

663
00:23:15,560 --> 00:23:17,652
- You can do it. - You can do it.

664
00:23:17,730 --> 00:23:19,680
- Let's start. - Let's succeed.

665
00:23:20,260 --> 00:23:21,729
The important part is the feet.

666
00:23:21,730 --> 00:23:24,069
When it passes the feet, pull it quickly.

667
00:23:24,070 --> 00:23:26,262
- That way, we won't trip. - Stop it.

668
00:23:26,500 --> 00:23:27,840
- Stop. - It's difficult.

669
00:23:27,841 --> 00:23:30,164
- Let's give it a try. - Okay, let's do it.

670
00:23:30,211 --> 00:23:31,453
We're ready.

671
00:23:31,510 --> 00:23:33,710
Let's cheer in 3, 2, 1. Let's go.

672
00:23:33,711 --> 00:23:35,910
(They make their first attempt.)

673
00:23:35,911 --> 00:23:37,279
- Okay. - Let's go.

674
00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:39,098
Start.

675
00:23:40,050 --> 00:23:41,667
- 1, 2. - 1, 2.

676
00:23:43,351 --> 00:23:45,947
- 2, 3, 4. - 3, 4.

677
00:23:46,560 --> 00:23:47,601
Who was it?

678
00:23:49,060 --> 00:23:50,329
(They fail after 3 jumps.)

679
00:23:50,330 --> 00:23:51,774
(Who was it?)

680
00:23:52,800 --> 00:23:55,799
(Seok Jin is the only one inside the line.)

681
00:23:55,800 --> 00:23:57,200
Seok Jin.

682
00:23:57,201 --> 00:23:58,400
- Seok Jin. - Seok Jin.

683
00:23:58,401 --> 00:24:00,592
- I'm sorry. - You're the only one on that side.

684
00:24:00,970 --> 00:24:02,586
It was your fault, right?

685
00:24:02,671 --> 00:24:04,964
- Seok Jin. - I'm sorry.

686
00:24:05,080 --> 00:24:06,555
Many people are having a hard time.

687
00:24:06,611 --> 00:24:08,710
I was on this side.

688
00:24:08,711 --> 00:24:11,180
- Why were you? - Why do you go that way?

689
00:24:11,181 --> 00:24:12,819
I'm sorry. Let's cheer up, everyone.

690
00:24:12,820 --> 00:24:14,249
- We can do it. - Let's go.

691
00:24:14,250 --> 00:24:15,604
Let's try again.

692
00:24:15,750 --> 00:24:16,831
Get ready.

693
00:24:17,451 --> 00:24:18,733
- Start. - Start.

694
00:24:19,921 --> 00:24:21,678
- 1, 2. - 2.

695
00:24:21,790 --> 00:24:22,860
Three.

696
00:24:22,861 --> 00:24:26,839
(Number of jumps)

697
00:24:27,101 --> 00:24:29,019
- 5, 6. - 5, 6.

698
00:24:29,201 --> 00:24:31,018
- 7, 8. - 7, 8.

699
00:24:31,230 --> 00:24:32,269
- 9. - 9.

700
00:24:32,270 --> 00:24:35,140
(Number of jumps)

701
00:24:35,141 --> 00:24:36,756
- 10. - What happened?

702
00:24:37,510 --> 00:24:38,940
- Who was it? - It was me.

703
00:24:38,941 --> 00:24:39,979
Who was it?

704
00:24:39,980 --> 00:24:42,071
(Who was it this time?)

705
00:24:42,780 --> 00:24:44,468
Gosh, I'm sorry.

706
00:24:44,921 --> 00:24:46,738
I'm sorry.

707
00:24:47,020 --> 00:24:48,364
It's okay, everyone.

708
00:24:48,490 --> 00:24:50,620
19 jumps aren't easy at all.

709
00:24:50,621 --> 00:24:51,802
It's not easy.

710
00:24:51,861 --> 00:24:53,789
She's the most relaxed.

711
00:24:53,790 --> 00:24:55,360
- Seriously. - She's putting a pin in her hair.

712
00:24:55,361 --> 00:24:57,460
- She's good. - She's very good.

713
00:24:57,461 --> 00:24:59,759
She has hands in her pockets.

714
00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:02,799
- She's so relaxed. - That's very impressive.

715
00:25:02,800 --> 00:25:04,900
She couldn't see in the middle of it,

716
00:25:04,901 --> 00:25:06,416
so she turned directions.

717
00:25:07,101 --> 00:25:08,929
- She's impressive. - Here's what I think.

718
00:25:09,070 --> 00:25:11,440
It gets difficult after 12 jumps.

719
00:25:11,441 --> 00:25:13,680
We have to concentrate starting then.

720
00:25:13,681 --> 00:25:15,094
If we concentrate, we can do it.

721
00:25:15,280 --> 00:25:16,749
- Let's go. - Let's go.

722
00:25:16,750 --> 00:25:17,749
- 19. - 19 jumps.

723
00:25:17,750 --> 00:25:18,831
Get ready.

724
00:25:19,381 --> 00:25:21,238
Start.

725
00:25:22,121 --> 00:25:24,009
- 1, 2. - 2.

726
00:25:24,351 --> 00:25:26,420
- 3, 4. - We got it.

727
00:25:26,421 --> 00:25:27,420
Five.

728
00:25:27,421 --> 00:25:29,108
- 6, 7. - 6, 7.

729
00:25:29,361 --> 00:25:31,108
- 8, 9. - 8, 9.

730
00:25:31,461 --> 00:25:33,278
- 10, 11. - 10, 11.

731
00:25:33,431 --> 00:25:34,529
Concentrate.

732
00:25:34,530 --> 00:25:36,200
(Everyone concentrates.)

733
00:25:36,201 --> 00:25:40,948
(Concentrating is the only way to survive.)

734
00:25:41,171 --> 00:25:42,870
- My thighs hurt. - 13.

735
00:25:42,871 --> 00:25:45,239
(My thighs are hurting.)

736
00:25:45,240 --> 00:25:46,880
14, 15.

737
00:25:46,881 --> 00:25:48,180
- My thighs hurt. - 16.

738
00:25:48,181 --> 00:25:50,574
It hurts! My thighs hurt!

739
00:25:50,810 --> 00:25:51,920
16.

740
00:25:51,921 --> 00:25:52,961
17.

741
00:25:53,250 --> 00:25:54,260
We're almost there.

742
00:25:55,351 --> 00:25:56,350
18.

743
00:25:56,351 --> 00:25:58,239
(They need 2 more jumps.)

744
00:25:59,161 --> 00:26:00,190
19.

745
00:26:00,191 --> 00:26:01,289
(They jump 19 times.)

746
00:26:01,290 --> 00:26:02,372
Okay.

747
00:26:02,760 --> 00:26:04,789
(With teamwork and those turning the rope, )

748
00:26:04,790 --> 00:26:09,113
(they successfully jump the rope in three attempts.)

749
00:26:09,270 --> 00:26:10,987
We did it.

750
00:26:12,070 --> 00:26:13,340
Good job, everyone.

751
00:26:13,341 --> 00:26:15,739
Thank you again for helping us despite the cold.

752
00:26:15,740 --> 00:26:17,410
- Thank you so much. - Thank you.

753
00:26:17,411 --> 00:26:18,479
Thank you.

754
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:20,258
It's late, but Happy New Year.

755
00:26:20,941 --> 00:26:21,950
Take care.

756
00:26:21,951 --> 00:26:23,809
(They win 800 dollars.)

757
00:26:23,810 --> 00:26:26,144
- You cleared your mission. - Why is he running?

758
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:27,530
What's going on?

759
00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:29,302
- Why is Kwang Soo here? - Why is he here?

760
00:26:29,621 --> 00:26:33,420
(Kwang Soo appears right after they clear the mission.)

761
00:26:33,421 --> 00:26:34,559
Are you done?

762
00:26:34,560 --> 00:26:36,390
- He seems to be up to something. - No.

763
00:26:36,391 --> 00:26:38,090
Look at him.

764
00:26:38,091 --> 00:26:39,729
- I'm not doing anything. - Stay away a little.

765
00:26:39,730 --> 00:26:41,115
- Don't think that way. - Stay away.

766
00:26:41,300 --> 00:26:42,870
- Stay away. You're dangerous. - No.

767
00:26:42,871 --> 00:26:44,829
- I have no place to go. - What's wrong?

768
00:26:44,830 --> 00:26:46,962
- Why are you here? - Aren't you on Haha's team?

769
00:26:47,401 --> 00:26:49,128
We cleared our mission.

770
00:26:49,941 --> 00:26:52,708
The first three to arrive at the next destination get a chance.

771
00:26:53,510 --> 00:26:55,228
Haha took the hint and ran away.

772
00:26:55,750 --> 00:26:57,630
Haha betrayed him.

773
00:26:58,181 --> 00:26:59,191
For now...

774
00:26:59,381 --> 00:27:02,019
- What is it? - What is it?

775
00:27:02,020 --> 00:27:04,390
Kwang Soo, ripped his hint. Don't let him get close.

776
00:27:04,391 --> 00:27:06,160
(Password Chart)

777
00:27:06,161 --> 00:27:07,190
Look at this.

778
00:27:07,191 --> 00:27:10,999
(Does this indicate an address?)

779
00:27:11,191 --> 00:27:13,400
(Jae Seok and So Min are still busy bowling.)

780
00:27:13,401 --> 00:27:14,643
Nice shot.

781
00:27:15,270 --> 00:27:17,529
(It's Yong Hyun's turn.)

782
00:27:17,530 --> 00:27:19,200
I hope it makes them fall.

783
00:27:19,201 --> 00:27:20,413
(He throws it with all his might.)

784
00:27:21,040 --> 00:27:22,122
Incredible.

785
00:27:22,211 --> 00:27:23,988
- What happened? - Incredible.

786
00:27:25,040 --> 00:27:27,333
(He's actually good at bowling.)

787
00:27:27,681 --> 00:27:31,861
(He has full swings and swag despite his small body.)

788
00:27:33,080 --> 00:27:36,384
(He gets a strike every time.)

789
00:27:37,050 --> 00:27:39,960
(This is how good I am.)

790
00:27:39,961 --> 00:27:43,829
(I'm the one who turns the tables.)

791
00:27:43,830 --> 00:27:46,225
- I'm sorry. - It's okay.

792
00:27:46,300 --> 00:27:47,512
My goodness.

793
00:27:48,161 --> 00:27:49,900
You did such a good job.

794
00:27:49,901 --> 00:27:51,299
(So Min wins 150 dollars, and Jae Seok wins 50 dollars.)

795
00:27:51,300 --> 00:27:52,440
Is it over?

796
00:27:52,441 --> 00:27:54,370
(So Min wins.)

797
00:27:54,371 --> 00:27:56,633
(He's sad that he lost.)

798
00:27:58,341 --> 00:28:00,664
What could this be, "L", "B", and "L"?

799
00:28:01,341 --> 00:28:02,549
What is this?

800
00:28:02,550 --> 00:28:03,590
(Password Chart)

801
00:28:04,711 --> 00:28:06,549
Do these mean numbers?

802
00:28:06,550 --> 00:28:08,549
(It should be written words and numbers.)

803
00:28:08,550 --> 00:28:09,702
Aren't these numbers?

804
00:28:09,750 --> 00:28:12,289
- "L", "B", "L"? - Aren't these numbers?

805
00:28:12,290 --> 00:28:15,590
- This is... - Could it be 464?

806
00:28:15,591 --> 00:28:17,259
Considering the order.

807
00:28:17,260 --> 00:28:20,759
Combine consonants and vowels.

808
00:28:20,760 --> 00:28:22,969
(He compares them to numbers.)

809
00:28:22,970 --> 00:28:24,529
Here it is. I found it.

810
00:28:24,530 --> 00:28:25,569
(I found it.)

811
00:28:25,570 --> 00:28:26,580
Here it is.

812
00:28:27,240 --> 00:28:28,250
This is it.

813
00:28:28,470 --> 00:28:29,969
It's 1 and 0.

814
00:28:29,970 --> 00:28:33,142
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10.

815
00:28:33,480 --> 00:28:36,180
"Cheongpa-ro". "L" becomes four.

816
00:28:36,181 --> 00:28:37,680
(He turns numbers to letters and vowels to numbers.)

817
00:28:37,681 --> 00:28:38,979
"Cheongpa-ro 464".

818
00:28:38,980 --> 00:28:42,289
(Cheongpa-ro 464?)

819
00:28:42,290 --> 00:28:45,220
Sir, could you take me to Cheongpa-ro 464?

820
00:28:45,661 --> 00:28:46,960
- Is it a number? - You know.

821
00:28:46,961 --> 00:28:49,385
- It's... - "K", "N", "D", "L", four.

822
00:28:49,830 --> 00:28:52,229
Hey, I found out.

823
00:28:52,230 --> 00:28:55,200
- Do you know the order? - I just found out.

824
00:28:56,570 --> 00:28:58,116
- Let's go. - Is it Cheongpa-ro?

825
00:28:58,641 --> 00:28:59,700
Cheongpa-ro?

826
00:28:59,701 --> 00:29:00,969
(They don't have time to waste.)

827
00:29:00,970 --> 00:29:02,020
Cheongpa-ro.

828
00:29:02,171 --> 00:29:04,464
- Cheongpa-ro 464. - Cheongpa-ro 464.

829
00:29:05,141 --> 00:29:08,171
I could have gone there alone.

830
00:29:08,550 --> 00:29:10,430
Look at her.

831
00:29:10,810 --> 00:29:12,134
Hey, So Min.

832
00:29:12,820 --> 00:29:16,289
(Ji Hyo gives Jong Kook 30 dollars and joins him.)

833
00:29:16,290 --> 00:29:17,432
Goodness.

834
00:29:17,451 --> 00:29:19,019
I should look it up.

835
00:29:19,020 --> 00:29:21,112
(They haven't figured it out yet.)

836
00:29:22,161 --> 00:29:23,460
- Where's their car? - It's leaving.

837
00:29:23,461 --> 00:29:26,025
- Can you follow their car? - Follow it.

838
00:29:26,730 --> 00:29:27,872
Whose car is it?

839
00:29:28,470 --> 00:29:29,999
I think it's Jong Kook's car.

840
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:32,425
(Who will be the first 3 to arrive?)

841
00:29:33,570 --> 00:29:36,399
My goodness.

842
00:29:37,010 --> 00:29:39,060
I came so early.

843
00:29:39,240 --> 00:29:42,715
Look at all the cameras that are set up.

844
00:29:43,151 --> 00:29:44,564
Is no one else here?

845
00:29:45,550 --> 00:29:47,079
(The first to arrive)

846
00:29:47,080 --> 00:29:48,590
(It's Haha.)

847
00:29:48,591 --> 00:29:51,620
Haha, you're the first to pull out a flag.

848
00:29:51,621 --> 00:29:54,286
You'll get a special chance in a few minutes.

849
00:29:54,720 --> 00:29:57,259
I'll tell you what kind of chance card it is.

850
00:29:57,260 --> 00:29:58,473
(A chance card is under a veil.)

851
00:29:59,030 --> 00:30:02,529
This is where you'll get a chance to increase...

852
00:30:02,530 --> 00:30:04,389
the money that you earned with people's help.

853
00:30:04,470 --> 00:30:06,870
- It's a betting house. - Okay.

854
00:30:06,871 --> 00:30:08,526
(A betting house where they can increase their money)

855
00:30:09,111 --> 00:30:10,370
(Here's our chance.)

856
00:30:10,371 --> 00:30:12,764
- Here it is. - I love this game.

857
00:30:13,540 --> 00:30:15,610
There are two betting zones.

858
00:30:15,611 --> 00:30:18,751
The first betting zone is full of pop-up pirates.

859
00:30:18,881 --> 00:30:21,001
The bet amount is different for each pirate.

860
00:30:21,050 --> 00:30:23,219
If the pirate pops up as you insert a dagger,

861
00:30:23,220 --> 00:30:26,958
you may win the bet amount times 2, 5, or 10.

862
00:30:27,220 --> 00:30:29,829
If the pirate doesn't pop up,

863
00:30:29,830 --> 00:30:31,881
you'll lose your bet amount.

864
00:30:32,201 --> 00:30:36,008
The pirate has to pop up? I'm good at this.

865
00:30:36,030 --> 00:30:38,100
Let's give a try.

866
00:30:38,101 --> 00:30:40,940
The other zone is flipping lucky cups.

867
00:30:40,941 --> 00:30:41,951
They're cups.

868
00:30:42,470 --> 00:30:44,009
On the 10-dollar table,

869
00:30:44,010 --> 00:30:45,757
there's a total of 30 cups.

870
00:30:45,810 --> 00:30:47,427
There are three duds.

871
00:30:47,480 --> 00:30:50,308
There are 5 duds at the 5-dollar table.

872
00:30:50,580 --> 00:30:52,979
At the last 100-dollar table,

873
00:30:52,980 --> 00:30:54,737
there are four duds.

874
00:30:55,290 --> 00:30:57,340
Four? That's worth playing.

875
00:30:57,891 --> 00:30:59,489
It sounds good. It's worth playing.

876
00:30:59,490 --> 00:31:01,581
You must make...

877
00:31:01,691 --> 00:31:04,360
1,000 dollars to leave.

878
00:31:04,361 --> 00:31:06,059
(You must make 1,000 dollars to leave.)

879
00:31:06,060 --> 00:31:07,160
1,000 dollars?

880
00:31:07,161 --> 00:31:11,341
(They can't believe what they just heard.)

881
00:31:12,540 --> 00:31:13,612
1,000 dollars?

882
00:31:13,841 --> 00:31:15,539
- We need it to leave. - This is difficult.

883
00:31:15,540 --> 00:31:18,440
Also, if you win 1,300 dollars,

884
00:31:18,441 --> 00:31:19,895
you can give away 300 dollars.

885
00:31:20,681 --> 00:31:23,438
- Really? - Can we give money? Okay.

886
00:31:23,580 --> 00:31:26,249
You're at a disadvantage the later you leave.

887
00:31:26,250 --> 00:31:27,765
(This must be remembered.)

888
00:31:28,621 --> 00:31:30,620
Which zone shall I go?

889
00:31:30,621 --> 00:31:31,863
(They must make 1,000 dollars and leave as soon as possible.)

890
00:31:32,621 --> 00:31:36,529
(Who will escape here first?)

891
00:31:36,990 --> 00:31:39,425
- Okay. - Let's get started.

892
00:31:39,631 --> 00:31:41,200
- Okay. - I bet 100 dollars.

893
00:31:41,201 --> 00:31:43,170
Seok Jin is competitive.

894
00:31:43,171 --> 00:31:45,868
- He has a lot of money now. - I knew it.

895
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:47,600
- I pick pop-up pirate. - Pop-up pirate?

896
00:31:47,601 --> 00:31:49,269
I pick the pop-up pirate. I'll bet 100 dollars.

897
00:31:49,270 --> 00:31:50,539
(He bets 100 dollars.)

898
00:31:50,540 --> 00:31:51,782
You get one chance in life.

899
00:31:52,181 --> 00:31:54,509
I get to leave if the pirate pops up.

900
00:31:54,510 --> 00:31:57,075
- Then it's over. - I get everything.

901
00:31:57,411 --> 00:31:59,704
- It won't pop up. - Seok Jin won't get it.

902
00:32:00,681 --> 00:32:01,779
(He inserts his first dagger.)

903
00:32:01,780 --> 00:32:02,950
It pops up easily.

904
00:32:02,951 --> 00:32:04,289
(Tick)

905
00:32:04,290 --> 00:32:05,590
- I thought it'd pop. - One.

906
00:32:05,591 --> 00:32:06,832
(That was one.)

907
00:32:07,661 --> 00:32:09,329
(It's his second dagger.)

908
00:32:09,330 --> 00:32:11,059
(The second attempt fails.)

909
00:32:11,060 --> 00:32:14,090
I don't think so. It won't pop.

910
00:32:14,230 --> 00:32:16,088
Just do it.

911
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:18,069
My goodness.

912
00:32:18,070 --> 00:32:20,569
- I have only 2 turns left. - He has 2 left.

913
00:32:20,570 --> 00:32:21,752
It doesn't pop up easily.

914
00:32:22,171 --> 00:32:24,370
If he fails, will he lose 100 dollars?

915
00:32:24,371 --> 00:32:25,410
- Why isn't it working? - He will lose it.

916
00:32:25,411 --> 00:32:26,451
I see.

917
00:32:27,341 --> 00:32:29,097
There's a slot that I suspect.

918
00:32:29,750 --> 00:32:31,809
Where is it? Tell me.

919
00:32:31,810 --> 00:32:34,650
(Can you tell me?)

920
00:32:34,651 --> 00:32:36,019
I'll tell you for 10 dollars.

921
00:32:36,020 --> 00:32:38,213
- 10 dollars? - He sounds convinced.

922
00:32:38,391 --> 00:32:39,501
Are you giving it to him?

923
00:32:39,961 --> 00:32:41,160
- Okay. - Is there a slot you know?

924
00:32:41,161 --> 00:32:42,829
- Yes. - Where is it?

925
00:32:42,830 --> 00:32:45,215
(Which slot does Jae Seok suspect?)

926
00:32:45,500 --> 00:32:46,529
It's around here.

927
00:32:46,530 --> 00:32:48,700
(His answer is vague.)

928
00:32:48,701 --> 00:32:50,329
(What do you mean "around here"?)

929
00:32:50,330 --> 00:32:51,630
- What? - Give me my 10 dollars.

930
00:32:51,631 --> 00:32:53,761
- Give it back. - Why? I told you.

931
00:32:53,871 --> 00:32:55,284
- Which slot is it? - Wait.

932
00:32:55,441 --> 00:32:57,969
- I told you. - Specify one slot.

933
00:32:57,970 --> 00:32:59,079
- It'll require more money. - Give it back.

934
00:32:59,080 --> 00:33:01,110
It'll require more money.

935
00:33:01,111 --> 00:33:03,410
"Around there" is appropriate for 10 dollars.

936
00:33:03,411 --> 00:33:05,079
That's right.

937
00:33:05,080 --> 00:33:07,302
An accurate slot would cost 1,000 dollars.

938
00:33:07,750 --> 00:33:10,090
That's right. It's around there.

939
00:33:10,091 --> 00:33:11,190
Ding, dong, dang.

940
00:33:11,191 --> 00:33:13,559
(He inserts his 4th dagger around there.)

941
00:33:13,560 --> 00:33:15,960
(The fourth attempt fails.)

942
00:33:15,961 --> 00:33:18,430
(1,000 dollars depend on his last dagger.)

943
00:33:18,431 --> 00:33:21,759
Kwang Soo's guess will cost 20 dollars.

944
00:33:21,760 --> 00:33:23,100
- Just give me 10 dollars. - Don't you need money?

945
00:33:23,101 --> 00:33:24,469
- I need 10 dollars. - Don't you?

946
00:33:24,470 --> 00:33:25,539
I gave Se Chan 10 dollars for the hint.

947
00:33:25,540 --> 00:33:27,670
Pick one slot. Don't do it like Jae Seok.

948
00:33:27,671 --> 00:33:29,993
- Okay. - Is this investment worthy?

949
00:33:30,371 --> 00:33:31,440
What will you do?

950
00:33:31,441 --> 00:33:34,239
Do you want 10 dollars now? Or do you want 50 dollars...

951
00:33:34,540 --> 00:33:35,560
if it pops?

952
00:33:36,250 --> 00:33:37,279
I want 10 dollars now.

953
00:33:37,280 --> 00:33:39,620
(Are you kidding me?)

954
00:33:39,621 --> 00:33:41,779
(He prefers 10 dollars now to 50 dollars he may not get.)

955
00:33:41,780 --> 00:33:43,032
The trick didn't work.

956
00:33:43,490 --> 00:33:44,590
He's smart.

957
00:33:44,591 --> 00:33:45,731
- Where? - This one.

958
00:33:45,961 --> 00:33:47,860
- This one? - The one on the left.

959
00:33:47,861 --> 00:33:48,989
This one?

960
00:33:48,990 --> 00:33:50,040
Okay.

961
00:33:50,161 --> 00:33:51,559
I'll trust you.

962
00:33:51,560 --> 00:33:56,430
(He trusts Kwang Soo's guess after paying 10 dollars.)

963
00:33:56,431 --> 00:33:57,430
It's over.

964
00:33:57,431 --> 00:33:59,269
(His information was wrong.)

965
00:33:59,270 --> 00:34:00,340
(Punching)

966
00:34:00,341 --> 00:34:02,289
Why are you hitting me?

967
00:34:02,341 --> 00:34:05,239
- How would I know? - It's different.

968
00:34:05,240 --> 00:34:07,563
- I lost 20 dollars. - It's different from guessing.

969
00:34:08,040 --> 00:34:09,090
He lost.

970
00:34:09,511 --> 00:34:10,561
Who's next?

971
00:34:10,980 --> 00:34:12,738
- Is it me? - Next is Jong Kook.

972
00:34:12,821 --> 00:34:13,820
Play it simple.

973
00:34:13,821 --> 00:34:14,820
(Jong Kook who has 250 dollars starts.)

974
00:34:14,821 --> 00:34:17,851
- It doesn't pop at times like this. - It doesn't.

975
00:34:17,991 --> 00:34:20,159
- What would you like to play? - Times two.

976
00:34:20,160 --> 00:34:21,706
My goodness.

977
00:34:21,890 --> 00:34:24,260
(He makes a small bet.)

978
00:34:24,261 --> 00:34:27,462
- He's such a coward. - I'll make several bets.

979
00:34:28,031 --> 00:34:30,757
The possibility is high. It'll pop up no matter what.

980
00:34:31,401 --> 00:34:32,440
Our ways are different.

981
00:34:32,441 --> 00:34:35,170
He likes to bet little at a time. We like to make bet everything.

982
00:34:35,171 --> 00:34:36,221
I like to bet everything.

983
00:34:37,471 --> 00:34:39,127
I'll pick the middle one.

984
00:34:39,310 --> 00:34:41,340
- Shall I go? - The size doesn't match him.

985
00:34:41,341 --> 00:34:42,461
It's so small.

986
00:34:43,180 --> 00:34:45,070
- 1. - 1.

987
00:34:46,551 --> 00:34:47,561
Two.

988
00:34:48,381 --> 00:34:50,420
- It doesn't pop. - That's true.

989
00:34:50,421 --> 00:34:53,260
It's not popping. He put 5 out of 8.

990
00:34:53,261 --> 00:34:54,705
(The third attempt fails.)

991
00:34:55,790 --> 00:34:57,229
(He only has 2 daggers left.)

992
00:34:57,230 --> 00:34:58,690
- Please. - Please.

993
00:34:58,691 --> 00:34:59,772
Okay, please.

994
00:35:00,430 --> 00:35:04,409
(He loses 100 dollars if he doesn't succeed in 2 turns.)

995
00:35:04,571 --> 00:35:05,581
Okay.

996
00:35:06,401 --> 00:35:08,492
(Jong Kook wins 200 dollars.)

997
00:35:08,971 --> 00:35:10,570
(He's disappointed.)

998
00:35:10,571 --> 00:35:13,166
Let's start over. One more time.

999
00:35:13,611 --> 00:35:15,227
- 200 dollars? - Okay.

1000
00:35:15,450 --> 00:35:17,299
That's another way.

1001
00:35:17,450 --> 00:35:18,763
He's getting into it.

1002
00:35:19,421 --> 00:35:21,979
- My goodness. - Here I go.

1003
00:35:21,980 --> 00:35:23,690
(If he succeeds, he wins 400 dollars.)

1004
00:35:23,691 --> 00:35:25,690
(The pirate pops up again.)

1005
00:35:25,691 --> 00:35:27,883
Okay, 400 dollars.

1006
00:35:29,230 --> 00:35:31,659
(Did he succeed again?)

1007
00:35:31,660 --> 00:35:33,360
That's not how to play the game.

1008
00:35:33,361 --> 00:35:35,429
Gosh, this is not fun.

1009
00:35:35,430 --> 00:35:37,800
- It's not fun. - Come on.

1010
00:35:37,801 --> 00:35:40,326
We have to stop him. What's going on?

1011
00:35:40,370 --> 00:35:41,670
He should play another game.

1012
00:35:41,671 --> 00:35:43,309
- What is he doing? - What's wrong?

1013
00:35:43,310 --> 00:35:44,840
You're done if you win 500 dollars.

1014
00:35:44,841 --> 00:35:46,539
- If you win 500 dollars, it's over. - Right.

1015
00:35:46,540 --> 00:35:49,079
Jong Kook, when you make 1,000 dollars,

1016
00:35:49,080 --> 00:35:51,309
- give me 50 dollars. - Give me what remains.

1017
00:35:51,310 --> 00:35:52,720
(Give me the change.)

1018
00:35:52,721 --> 00:35:54,195
Okay, 500 dollars.

1019
00:35:54,250 --> 00:35:56,270
Excuse me, what are you doing?

1020
00:35:56,421 --> 00:35:58,789
- My goodness. - When you have 1,000 dollars...

1021
00:35:58,790 --> 00:36:01,042
- Let me play first. - Listen.

1022
00:36:01,691 --> 00:36:04,356
- Go bankrupt. - Seok Jin said, "Go bankrupt".

1023
00:36:04,591 --> 00:36:06,216
He bet 500 dollars on pop-up pirate.

1024
00:36:06,261 --> 00:36:07,260
Here I go.

1025
00:36:07,261 --> 00:36:11,643
(If he succeeds, he wins 1,000 dollars and escapes.)

1026
00:36:11,770 --> 00:36:13,458
- Please. - Please.

1027
00:36:13,540 --> 00:36:14,883
He looks amazing.

1028
00:36:17,270 --> 00:36:18,309
(It's his first dagger.)

1029
00:36:18,310 --> 00:36:19,897
- It didn't work. - Okay.

1030
00:36:20,381 --> 00:36:21,539
I hope he fails.

1031
00:36:21,540 --> 00:36:22,793
(Stay inside, pirate.)

1032
00:36:24,881 --> 00:36:26,519
(He has 4 daggers left.)

1033
00:36:26,520 --> 00:36:27,550
Okay.

1034
00:36:27,551 --> 00:36:29,119
(The second attempt fails.)

1035
00:36:29,120 --> 00:36:31,575
- Please. - Stay in for three more times.

1036
00:36:31,850 --> 00:36:33,841
- Please. - Here he goes.

1037
00:36:33,921 --> 00:36:34,920
Please.

1038
00:36:34,921 --> 00:36:37,789
(If he wins, Jong Kook escapes immediately.)

1039
00:36:38,961 --> 00:36:41,626
(His lips turn dry.)

1040
00:36:42,500 --> 00:36:44,900
(What will happen with his third dagger?)

1041
00:36:44,901 --> 00:36:46,456
(Popping)

1042
00:36:47,370 --> 00:36:50,744
(Jong Kook wins 1,000 dollars.)

1043
00:36:51,370 --> 00:36:53,462
(He has about 1,050 dollars.)

1044
00:36:54,180 --> 00:36:57,949
(This isn't fun at all.)

1045
00:36:57,950 --> 00:37:00,072
- Give me 50 dollars. - Kim Jong Kook.

1046
00:37:00,250 --> 00:37:03,019
Kim Jong Kook, Kim Jong Kook.

1047
00:37:03,020 --> 00:37:04,389
- Goodness. - Kim Jong Kook.

1048
00:37:04,390 --> 00:37:06,289
- Jong Kook. - Give me some.

1049
00:37:06,290 --> 00:37:07,590
(He can give the rest to anyone.)

1050
00:37:07,591 --> 00:37:09,611
50 dollars isn't much. Do you still want it?

1051
00:37:09,660 --> 00:37:11,530
- Yes. - I'll pay you back...

1052
00:37:11,531 --> 00:37:12,874
no matter what.

1053
00:37:13,031 --> 00:37:14,130
- Jong Kook. - I'll be good to you.

1054
00:37:14,131 --> 00:37:15,313
They have enough money already.

1055
00:37:15,631 --> 00:37:17,286
Okay, can you step back?

1056
00:37:17,330 --> 00:37:18,400
Kookookaka.

1057
00:37:18,401 --> 00:37:19,754
(Kookookaka)

1058
00:37:20,401 --> 00:37:21,539
Kookookaka.

1059
00:37:21,540 --> 00:37:23,692
(Jae Seok tries to be cute.)

1060
00:37:24,471 --> 00:37:26,280
(Just give it to him.)

1061
00:37:26,281 --> 00:37:27,725
You should beat him up.

1062
00:37:28,640 --> 00:37:30,671
- Don't you feel sorry for him? - I was scared.

1063
00:37:30,810 --> 00:37:31,809
Spread your hands.

1064
00:37:31,810 --> 00:37:32,849
(Jae Seok makes you feel sorry for him.)

1065
00:37:32,850 --> 00:37:33,849
(Jong Kook gives him 50 dollars.)

1066
00:37:33,850 --> 00:37:35,320
- Thank you. - I approve.

1067
00:37:35,321 --> 00:37:37,411
Stay strong.

1068
00:37:37,991 --> 00:37:39,789
Take the money and stay strong.

1069
00:37:39,790 --> 00:37:41,377
Gosh.

1070
00:37:42,390 --> 00:37:43,804
I can't stand it.

1071
00:37:44,691 --> 00:37:46,860
(This is capitalism.)

1072
00:37:46,861 --> 00:37:48,275
Okay!

1073
00:37:48,330 --> 00:37:49,530
All kinds of things happen.

1074
00:37:49,531 --> 00:37:52,227
(Jong Kook is about to escape.)

1075
00:37:53,171 --> 00:37:55,423
(Haha suddenly takes a pose.)

1076
00:37:56,471 --> 00:37:58,409
(What are you doing? I'm leaving.)

1077
00:37:58,410 --> 00:37:59,510
What's with him?

1078
00:37:59,511 --> 00:38:01,880
Jong Kook, you can leave now.

1079
00:38:01,881 --> 00:38:03,365
- What are you doing? - What's with Haha?

1080
00:38:04,310 --> 00:38:06,019
Dawn club!

1081
00:38:06,020 --> 00:38:09,690
(What's going on?)

1082
00:38:09,691 --> 00:38:11,550
(When Haha shouts the words, the siren goes off.)

1083
00:38:11,551 --> 00:38:12,690
What?

1084
00:38:12,691 --> 00:38:14,019
(When Haha shouts the words, the siren goes off.)

1085
00:38:14,020 --> 00:38:15,220
- What's going on? - What is this?

1086
00:38:15,221 --> 00:38:16,729
- What is this? - What is this?

1087
00:38:16,730 --> 00:38:17,872
"Dawn club"?

1088
00:38:18,461 --> 00:38:20,116
"Dawn club chance".

1089
00:38:20,700 --> 00:38:24,105
When the 1st person to win 1,000 dollars is about to escape,

1090
00:38:24,270 --> 00:38:27,200
hold up the chance card and shout, "dawn club".

1091
00:38:27,471 --> 00:38:29,894
Then half that person's money...

1092
00:38:29,941 --> 00:38:31,425
will be transferred to you.

1093
00:38:32,171 --> 00:38:33,809
Dawn club!

1094
00:38:33,810 --> 00:38:34,809
(You didn't see this coming.)

1095
00:38:34,810 --> 00:38:35,992
Really?

1096
00:38:36,281 --> 00:38:37,320
Jong Kook will lose his money?

1097
00:38:37,711 --> 00:38:39,700
- After giving up 50 dollars? - What is this?

1098
00:38:39,750 --> 00:38:41,650
- What is this? - What is "dawn club"?

1099
00:38:41,651 --> 00:38:42,949
What is this?

1100
00:38:42,950 --> 00:38:44,449
Give back 50 dollars.

1101
00:38:44,450 --> 00:38:45,889
- What are you talking about? - Give it back.

1102
00:38:45,890 --> 00:38:47,260
- Why would I? - Give it back.

1103
00:38:47,261 --> 00:38:48,960
- Why would I... - Is this a chance?

1104
00:38:48,961 --> 00:38:51,486
- Why did I... - Take it back.

1105
00:38:51,631 --> 00:38:52,659
- Give me back my 50 dollars. - What happens now?

1106
00:38:52,660 --> 00:38:54,429
- Jong Kook can't leave. - He can't?

1107
00:38:54,430 --> 00:38:56,470
You must be so annoyed.

1108
00:38:56,471 --> 00:38:59,099
(Teasing)

1109
00:38:59,100 --> 00:39:02,170
- Give me back my 50 dollars. - It's mine. Why would I?

1110
00:39:02,200 --> 00:39:03,610
- I can't believe you. - I mean...

1111
00:39:03,611 --> 00:39:04,682
It's mine.

1112
00:39:04,941 --> 00:39:06,880
- Oh, my. - Gosh, this is...

1113
00:39:06,881 --> 00:39:08,340
It already happened.

1114
00:39:08,341 --> 00:39:09,926
All kinds of things happen.

1115
00:39:10,080 --> 00:39:11,969
Why is it "dawn club"?

1116
00:39:12,180 --> 00:39:14,249
You'll find out later.

1117
00:39:14,250 --> 00:39:15,619
- There must be something more. - Okay.

1118
00:39:15,620 --> 00:39:16,820
You'll probably be clubbed by me.

1119
00:39:16,821 --> 00:39:18,889
(You'll probably be clubbed by me.)

1120
00:39:18,890 --> 00:39:20,990
(Haha will be clubbed by Jong Kook at dawn.)

1121
00:39:20,991 --> 00:39:22,860
That's it. That must be it.

1122
00:39:22,861 --> 00:39:23,960
At dawn?

1123
00:39:23,961 --> 00:39:25,102
(It sounds convincing.)

1124
00:39:25,591 --> 00:39:26,813
He gets money,

1125
00:39:27,131 --> 00:39:28,559
but he has to be clubbed too.

1126
00:39:28,560 --> 00:39:30,692
We'll find out at dawn.

1127
00:39:31,071 --> 00:39:33,697
The times two table will be taken away.

1128
00:39:34,100 --> 00:39:36,309
- Gosh. - That was a good one.

1129
00:39:36,310 --> 00:39:37,840
(The table the first winner chose is taken away.)

1130
00:39:37,841 --> 00:39:39,052
Dawn club!

1131
00:39:39,480 --> 00:39:40,510
What does that even mean?

1132
00:39:40,511 --> 00:39:41,723
I thought you were just ad-libbing.

1133
00:39:42,341 --> 00:39:43,349
I thought it was just a weird ad-lib.

1134
00:39:43,350 --> 00:39:44,624
I didn't understand what you were doing.

1135
00:39:44,711 --> 00:39:46,720
I didn't know why he was taking a pose.

1136
00:39:46,721 --> 00:39:47,832
Next player.

1137
00:39:47,921 --> 00:39:48,931
It's me.

1138
00:39:50,191 --> 00:39:51,849
Kwang Soo will bet all the money he has.

1139
00:39:51,850 --> 00:39:53,235
(Let us tell you about Kwang Soo.)

1140
00:39:53,290 --> 00:39:54,320
It's my turn.

1141
00:39:54,321 --> 00:39:57,690
(As soon as he picks up a dagger, the pirate gets ready to pop up.)

1142
00:39:57,691 --> 00:40:02,900
(This master never fails to meet the pirate.)

1143
00:40:02,901 --> 00:40:05,199
100 dollars, pop-up pirate.

1144
00:40:05,200 --> 00:40:07,139
(The legendary unlucky person makes a bold move.)

1145
00:40:07,140 --> 00:40:08,554
100 dollars, pop-up pirate.

1146
00:40:09,071 --> 00:40:10,539
If you succeed, you'll win 1,000 dollars and escape.

1147
00:40:10,540 --> 00:40:11,854
(He goes for winning 1,000 dollars with 100 dollars.)

1148
00:40:12,270 --> 00:40:13,539
If you succeed,

1149
00:40:13,540 --> 00:40:15,560
- the situation will reverse. - He'll have extra 50 dollars.

1150
00:40:15,611 --> 00:40:17,468
When he wants it to pop up, it won't.

1151
00:40:17,850 --> 00:40:18,880
If he succeeds, it'll be unbelievable.

1152
00:40:18,881 --> 00:40:21,001
- If he succeeds... - We'll all have to recognize him.

1153
00:40:21,281 --> 00:40:22,291
He deserves 100 times the money he bets.

1154
00:40:23,191 --> 00:40:24,504
(It's in.)

1155
00:40:25,250 --> 00:40:27,342
(The first attempt fails.)

1156
00:40:28,060 --> 00:40:30,918
(Serious)

1157
00:40:32,191 --> 00:40:34,159
(Kwang Soo has 4 chances left to escape.)

1158
00:40:34,160 --> 00:40:35,817
It looks...

1159
00:40:36,500 --> 00:40:40,340
(What about his second attempt?)

1160
00:40:40,341 --> 00:40:41,653
(It's in.)

1161
00:40:42,810 --> 00:40:45,366
Do as you usually do.

1162
00:40:46,381 --> 00:40:48,329
Please try this slot.

1163
00:40:48,381 --> 00:40:50,249
Do me a favor. Here.

1164
00:40:50,250 --> 00:40:53,108
(So Min picks out a slot.)

1165
00:40:53,151 --> 00:40:54,190
- Here? - Yes.

1166
00:40:55,381 --> 00:40:58,889
(Kwang Soo sticks his third dagger in the slot.)

1167
00:40:58,890 --> 00:41:00,090
(It fails again.)

1168
00:41:00,091 --> 00:41:01,619
You just blew one chance.

1169
00:41:01,620 --> 00:41:02,990
(It fails again.)

1170
00:41:02,991 --> 00:41:04,590
(It's So Min's fault.)

1171
00:41:04,591 --> 00:41:06,729
- I mean... - He just blew one chance.

1172
00:41:06,730 --> 00:41:08,400
- Why did you do that? - It was a favor.

1173
00:41:08,401 --> 00:41:11,299
- What was that? - You did her a favor.

1174
00:41:11,700 --> 00:41:12,869
I don't know anymore.

1175
00:41:12,870 --> 00:41:14,617
- How many do you have left? - Two.

1176
00:41:15,171 --> 00:41:17,392
Just do it casually as I did.

1177
00:41:17,870 --> 00:41:18,880
Do you have any feelings?

1178
00:41:19,680 --> 00:41:20,909
- No? - Here.

1179
00:41:20,910 --> 00:41:22,550
(So Min butts in again.)

1180
00:41:22,551 --> 00:41:24,010
- Hey. - Seriously.

1181
00:41:24,011 --> 00:41:25,010
I mean it.

1182
00:41:25,011 --> 00:41:26,780
I've been thinking about that slot too.

1183
00:41:26,781 --> 00:41:28,133
- Either that or that. - No.

1184
00:41:29,321 --> 00:41:30,349
Move.

1185
00:41:30,350 --> 00:41:32,519
(Jae Seok butts in.)

1186
00:41:32,520 --> 00:41:33,570
There.

1187
00:41:34,160 --> 00:41:36,559
(Jae Seok points at a slot.)

1188
00:41:36,560 --> 00:41:37,671
- I'd go for this one. - Here?

1189
00:41:38,461 --> 00:41:40,653
- This one? Here? - He respects his opinion.

1190
00:41:40,700 --> 00:41:41,699
Still, Kwang Soo respects...

1191
00:41:41,700 --> 00:41:43,518
Jae Seok's opinion because he is so unlucky.

1192
00:41:43,971 --> 00:41:45,819
Kwang Soo respects him.

1193
00:41:46,370 --> 00:41:47,380
Let's go.

1194
00:41:47,600 --> 00:41:50,510
(Kwang Soo decides to trust Jae Seok's gut.)

1195
00:41:50,511 --> 00:41:51,753
You're the unluckiest one.

1196
00:41:52,011 --> 00:41:54,639
(Is the older unlucky one right?)

1197
00:41:54,640 --> 00:41:56,079
(It pops up.)

1198
00:41:56,080 --> 00:41:57,121
It popped up.

1199
00:41:57,680 --> 00:42:01,590
(Jae Seok was right.)

1200
00:42:02,120 --> 00:42:03,202
It popped up.

1201
00:42:03,750 --> 00:42:04,749
Jae Seok.

1202
00:42:04,750 --> 00:42:06,119
(It's me.)

1203
00:42:06,120 --> 00:42:07,320
I'm so shocked.

1204
00:42:07,321 --> 00:42:08,805
(What is with this man?)

1205
00:42:09,390 --> 00:42:10,389
Jae Seok.

1206
00:42:10,390 --> 00:42:12,329
(The odds were 1 in 21.)

1207
00:42:12,330 --> 00:42:15,329
(Jae Seok had only a 4.8 percent chance.)

1208
00:42:15,330 --> 00:42:16,699
I'm surprised at myself too.

1209
00:42:16,700 --> 00:42:17,710
(He is surprised too.)

1210
00:42:18,571 --> 00:42:19,699
No more club?

1211
00:42:19,700 --> 00:42:21,317
(Let's stop Kwang Soo from escaping.)

1212
00:42:21,341 --> 00:42:23,390
How much will Kwang Soo give to Jae Seok?

1213
00:42:23,910 --> 00:42:26,638
It popped up. He should pay Jae Seok.

1214
00:42:26,980 --> 00:42:29,101
- It's incredible. - I can't believe it.

1215
00:42:29,910 --> 00:42:31,210
Haha, you have something more?

1216
00:42:31,211 --> 00:42:32,479
(Kwang Soo has an extra 50 dollars.)

1217
00:42:32,480 --> 00:42:33,763
Ordinary club!

1218
00:42:34,020 --> 00:42:35,119
What's wrong?

1219
00:42:35,120 --> 00:42:36,119
(It's not a dawn club.)

1220
00:42:36,120 --> 00:42:38,289
(It's just an ordinary club.)

1221
00:42:38,290 --> 00:42:39,573
How did you do that?

1222
00:42:39,890 --> 00:42:41,920
(Give me the extra money.)

1223
00:42:41,921 --> 00:42:42,929
This is crazy.

1224
00:42:42,930 --> 00:42:44,429
- Jae Seok is crazy. - There was even a dagger left.

1225
00:42:44,430 --> 00:42:45,976
Jae Seok picked out the slot, right?

1226
00:42:46,100 --> 00:42:47,929
How do you do that? Do you see something?

1227
00:42:47,930 --> 00:42:51,229
There was a slot that was powerfully drawing me to it.

1228
00:42:51,230 --> 00:42:52,269
That's so cool.

1229
00:42:52,270 --> 00:42:53,940
That was amazing. It was the first time...

1230
00:42:53,941 --> 00:42:55,400
I'd thought it was cool when the pirate popped up.

1231
00:42:55,401 --> 00:42:57,539
(Everyone is amazed at Jae Seok.)

1232
00:42:57,540 --> 00:42:59,539
(Kwang Soo whispers he is leaving.)

1233
00:42:59,540 --> 00:43:00,679
- Kwang Soo, hold on. - Hey.

1234
00:43:00,680 --> 00:43:01,893
Let's talk first.

1235
00:43:02,611 --> 00:43:05,010
- Give us the extra money. - Give us the extra money.

1236
00:43:05,011 --> 00:43:07,777
Kwang Soo had extra 50 dollars on top of 1,000 dollars.

1237
00:43:08,520 --> 00:43:09,803
It's been donated to the society.

1238
00:43:11,290 --> 00:43:13,715
(I'm out of here.)

1239
00:43:13,839 --> 00:43:17,439
<font color="#fcc89b">[VIU Ver] SBS E440 Running Man</font>
<font color="#ff80ff">"The Great War of Money Race"</font>
<font color="#ff5fa2">-♥ Ruo Xi ♥-</font>

1240
00:43:17,560 --> 00:43:19,247
How can he...

1241
00:43:19,531 --> 00:43:20,760
He should have given you...

1242
00:43:20,761 --> 00:43:22,300
- at least 30 dollars. - He did a good thing.

1243
00:43:22,301 --> 00:43:23,988
I should have donated too.

1244
00:43:25,430 --> 00:43:26,840
(Kwang Soo leaves after donating 50 dollars to the society.)

1245
00:43:26,841 --> 00:43:28,417
Please turn in your cell phone.

1246
00:43:29,100 --> 00:43:30,121
My cell phone?

1247
00:43:30,341 --> 00:43:31,909
- I have to turn in my cell phone? - Yes.

1248
00:43:31,910 --> 00:43:34,610
(Puzzled)

1249
00:43:34,611 --> 00:43:35,691
Why...

1250
00:43:36,180 --> 00:43:38,050
Hold on. What...

1251
00:43:38,051 --> 00:43:39,494
(He is blindfolded too?)

1252
00:43:39,950 --> 00:43:41,349
What is this?

1253
00:43:41,350 --> 00:43:43,849
(Without any means of contact, he is forced to get in the car.)

1254
00:43:43,850 --> 00:43:44,900
This is how we move?

1255
00:43:45,421 --> 00:43:47,036
Why am I blindfolded?

1256
00:43:47,761 --> 00:43:49,659
I'm not supposed to know where I'm going?

1257
00:43:49,660 --> 00:43:51,751
(He arrives at a mysterious place.)

1258
00:43:52,361 --> 00:43:53,900
There has to be a huge reward for me.

1259
00:43:53,901 --> 00:43:54,929
(The national flag is raised high.)

1260
00:43:54,930 --> 00:43:56,599
There has to be.

1261
00:43:56,600 --> 00:43:58,229
(The building looks mysterious.)

1262
00:43:58,230 --> 00:43:59,513
We're entering? Where?

1263
00:43:59,801 --> 00:44:00,840
Do I walk forward?

1264
00:44:00,841 --> 00:44:02,470
(He enters the building without seeing anything.)

1265
00:44:02,471 --> 00:44:03,956
What is this? I hear a door.

1266
00:44:04,611 --> 00:44:06,079
Where... Hold on.

1267
00:44:06,080 --> 00:44:08,303
What is this? Hold on. Where am I?

1268
00:44:09,211 --> 00:44:12,079
(Where am I?)

1269
00:44:12,080 --> 00:44:13,320
(Locked)

1270
00:44:13,321 --> 00:44:14,479
What's going on?

1271
00:44:14,480 --> 00:44:17,420
(The door is locked.)

1272
00:44:17,421 --> 00:44:18,835
What is this? Why did you lock the door?

1273
00:44:19,020 --> 00:44:20,820
(Kwang Soo is locked up without any idea where he is.)

1274
00:44:20,821 --> 00:44:21,889
I mean...

1275
00:44:21,890 --> 00:44:24,289
(Kwang Soo is locked up without any idea where he is.)

1276
00:44:24,290 --> 00:44:27,260
(8 cells)

1277
00:44:27,261 --> 00:44:28,429
You have arrived...

1278
00:44:28,430 --> 00:44:30,329
at the final mission place.

1279
00:44:30,330 --> 00:44:31,340
(The clock is stopped at 100 minutes.)

1280
00:44:32,100 --> 00:44:33,999
This is the 100 Minute House.

1281
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:36,440
With each minute passing, you'll lose 10 dollars...

1282
00:44:36,441 --> 00:44:38,070
out of your 1,000 dollars.

1283
00:44:38,071 --> 00:44:39,539
You have to escape from this place...

1284
00:44:39,540 --> 00:44:40,979
before you lose all your money.

1285
00:44:40,980 --> 00:44:42,079
(Escape before you lose all your money.)

1286
00:44:42,080 --> 00:44:44,880
There are two questions on the wall.

1287
00:44:44,881 --> 00:44:46,769
You're to answer them.

1288
00:44:47,250 --> 00:44:50,149
If you say the wrong answer, you'll be splashed with water.

1289
00:44:50,221 --> 00:44:53,690
Answer the questions as fast as you can...

1290
00:44:53,691 --> 00:44:55,690
and find out the conditions for becoming the final winner.

1291
00:44:55,691 --> 00:44:58,014
(Escape to find out the conditions for becoming the final winner.)

1292
00:44:58,790 --> 00:45:01,360
(His 100 minutes starts now.)

1293
00:45:01,361 --> 00:45:03,088
I'll answer the questions.

1294
00:45:03,870 --> 00:45:04,880
Gosh.

1295
00:45:05,671 --> 00:45:08,064
"Find the similarity among these three."

1296
00:45:08,341 --> 00:45:10,593
"One, Itaewon has it, but Apgujeong doesn't."

1297
00:45:10,971 --> 00:45:12,610
"Two, Hyochang Park has it,"

1298
00:45:12,611 --> 00:45:14,095
"but Children's Grand Park doesn't."

1299
00:45:14,381 --> 00:45:16,909
"World Cup Stadium has it, but Sports Complex doesn't."

1300
00:45:16,910 --> 00:45:17,991
What is this?

1301
00:45:18,781 --> 00:45:21,648
Number two. “On a distant day, when the skies first opened,

1302
00:45:21,850 --> 00:45:23,669
“Somewhere a cock must have crowed.”

1303
00:45:24,191 --> 00:45:26,090
(Let me guess.)

1304
00:45:26,091 --> 00:45:27,171
On-when-was.

1305
00:45:27,660 --> 00:45:28,801
A-the-a.

1306
00:45:29,830 --> 00:45:32,932
(It's creative but irrelevant.)

1307
00:45:33,160 --> 00:45:34,559
How would I know this one?

1308
00:45:34,560 --> 00:45:35,610
(Frustrated)

1309
00:45:35,961 --> 00:45:36,981
The poem...

1310
00:45:37,500 --> 00:45:39,170
I've never even seen this poem before.

1311
00:45:39,171 --> 00:45:40,400
(He is losing both time and money.)

1312
00:45:40,401 --> 00:45:42,622
- We have to get Kwang Soo. - We have to get him.

1313
00:45:42,671 --> 00:45:44,024
We have to get him.

1314
00:45:44,270 --> 00:45:45,320
100 dollars.

1315
00:45:46,381 --> 00:45:48,840
- I think this has a better chance. - Pop-up pirate is better.

1316
00:45:48,841 --> 00:45:50,809
If it pops up...

1317
00:45:50,810 --> 00:45:52,179
(Se Chan bets 100 dollars on the times 5 pop-up pirate.)

1318
00:45:52,180 --> 00:45:53,292
- It's the first try. - Here goes Se Chan.

1319
00:45:53,721 --> 00:45:55,119
- Here we go. - Se Chan!

1320
00:45:55,120 --> 00:45:58,519
(He has an 8.3 percent chance.)

1321
00:45:58,520 --> 00:46:00,006
(The first attempt fails.)

1322
00:46:00,390 --> 00:46:02,613
If he succeeds, he wins 500 dollars.

1323
00:46:04,461 --> 00:46:05,471
500 dollars.

1324
00:46:05,591 --> 00:46:08,460
(The second attempt fails.)

1325
00:46:08,461 --> 00:46:10,229
- Se Chan. - This doesn't feel right.

1326
00:46:10,230 --> 00:46:11,381
- Gosh. - Calm down.

1327
00:46:11,870 --> 00:46:12,869
He ran out of energy.

1328
00:46:12,870 --> 00:46:15,340
(He has 3 chances and 9 slots left.)

1329
00:46:15,341 --> 00:46:17,670
(The third attempt fails.)

1330
00:46:17,671 --> 00:46:19,186
Gosh.

1331
00:46:19,441 --> 00:46:20,510
This is hard.

1332
00:46:20,511 --> 00:46:21,753
(He'll probably fail.)

1333
00:46:22,011 --> 00:46:24,333
- Jae Seok, can you pick one out? - Do you have only one chance left?

1334
00:46:24,910 --> 00:46:25,991
I have two more.

1335
00:46:26,850 --> 00:46:28,780
I want to get paid first.

1336
00:46:28,781 --> 00:46:30,119
(His service is not for free anymore.)

1337
00:46:30,120 --> 00:46:32,444
(Please pay me first.)

1338
00:46:32,551 --> 00:46:34,619
- He wants to get paid first. - He is disappointed.

1339
00:46:34,620 --> 00:46:36,246
(I have bad memories.)

1340
00:46:37,560 --> 00:46:38,601
Give me just 10 dollars.

1341
00:46:39,461 --> 00:46:41,159
- I'd give him. - Okay.

1342
00:46:41,160 --> 00:46:42,574
(Se Chan pays him right away.)

1343
00:46:42,901 --> 00:46:44,699
Will Jae Seok escape with this money?

1344
00:46:44,700 --> 00:46:46,869
(He sells his bad luck.)

1345
00:46:46,870 --> 00:46:49,093
He'll become rich by doing this.

1346
00:46:49,241 --> 00:46:52,746
He is a psychic. A pop-up pirate psychic.

1347
00:46:53,040 --> 00:46:54,424
Just stick it in any slot you want.

1348
00:46:54,810 --> 00:46:55,851
What?

1349
00:46:56,750 --> 00:46:59,519
(You want me to use 1 chance out of the 2 I have left?)

1350
00:46:59,520 --> 00:47:01,238
He'll help you when you have only one left.

1351
00:47:01,750 --> 00:47:02,920
He sounds like a magician.

1352
00:47:02,921 --> 00:47:04,536
"Just stick it in any slot you want. It'll pop up."

1353
00:47:05,250 --> 00:47:06,260
Stick it in.

1354
00:47:06,261 --> 00:47:07,889
(Following Jae Seok's order, )

1355
00:47:07,890 --> 00:47:09,420
(Se Chan sticks the dagger in a slot he likes.)

1356
00:47:09,421 --> 00:47:11,309
- It's in. - Now,

1357
00:47:11,361 --> 00:47:12,371
it's his turn.

1358
00:47:12,461 --> 00:47:13,699
It's Jae Seok's turn.

1359
00:47:13,700 --> 00:47:15,329
(Jae Seok helps out when there is only one chance left.)

1360
00:47:15,330 --> 00:47:16,583
If it pops up, it'll be incredible.

1361
00:47:16,730 --> 00:47:18,269
He is good at such silly things.

1362
00:47:18,270 --> 00:47:21,401
(He is good at such silly things.)

1363
00:47:22,770 --> 00:47:23,809
What did you...

1364
00:47:23,810 --> 00:47:24,809
(Silly things?)

1365
00:47:24,810 --> 00:47:25,851
Hold on.

1366
00:47:26,011 --> 00:47:28,465
I'm working hard here.

1367
00:47:28,711 --> 00:47:30,326
I'm good at silly things?

1368
00:47:30,551 --> 00:47:33,449
- Gosh, I can't believe you. - My goodness.

1369
00:47:33,450 --> 00:47:35,067
He is not even ashamed.

1370
00:47:35,480 --> 00:47:37,519
He is shameless.

1371
00:47:37,520 --> 00:47:38,690
(He focuses on the silly matter.)

1372
00:47:38,691 --> 00:47:40,260
- Stick it here. - Where?

1373
00:47:40,261 --> 00:47:41,590
- Here. - Here?

1374
00:47:41,591 --> 00:47:42,590
(He transfers his bad luck.)

1375
00:47:42,591 --> 00:47:43,741
- Here? - Yes.

1376
00:47:43,861 --> 00:47:44,871
Will it pop up?

1377
00:47:45,631 --> 00:47:46,829
Seriously?

1378
00:47:46,830 --> 00:47:49,123
(If Jae Seok is right, Se Chan will win 500 dollars.)

1379
00:47:49,230 --> 00:47:55,199
(Will Jae Seok do another miracle?)

1380
00:47:55,200 --> 00:47:57,362
(It popped up.)

1381
00:47:58,111 --> 00:48:00,710
(Jae Seok is right for the 2nd time in a row.)

1382
00:48:00,711 --> 00:48:02,094
What is this?

1383
00:48:02,241 --> 00:48:03,492
- What is this? - What is this?

1384
00:48:04,480 --> 00:48:06,844
- He is surprised too. - What is this?

1385
00:48:07,350 --> 00:48:08,380
Unbelievable.

1386
00:48:08,381 --> 00:48:09,749
- Where was it? - He is...

1387
00:48:09,750 --> 00:48:11,508
- What is this? - He is surprised too.

1388
00:48:11,591 --> 00:48:13,090
- What's going on? - What did you do?

1389
00:48:13,091 --> 00:48:14,879
- How did you do it? - It gave me goosebumps.

1390
00:48:14,921 --> 00:48:17,860
It's not easy to succeed two times in a row.

1391
00:48:17,861 --> 00:48:19,389
You can't see anything.

1392
00:48:19,390 --> 00:48:20,829
(Can you see something?)

1393
00:48:20,830 --> 00:48:23,093
- What is this? - You can't see anything.

1394
00:48:23,270 --> 00:48:26,027
You earned so much by paying 10 dollars.

1395
00:48:26,100 --> 00:48:27,990
When I stuck it in,

1396
00:48:28,571 --> 00:48:29,970
it gave me goosebumps.

1397
00:48:29,971 --> 00:48:31,809
Yu Jae Seok chances should be forbidden.

1398
00:48:31,810 --> 00:48:32,921
(To be fair)

1399
00:48:33,040 --> 00:48:35,539
- It's too effective. - I'm scared at myself.

1400
00:48:35,540 --> 00:48:38,249
- It's too effective. - I don't know what I might do.

1401
00:48:38,250 --> 00:48:39,260
He'll be wrong this time.

1402
00:48:39,580 --> 00:48:41,650
How much did I bet? 100 dollars?

1403
00:48:41,651 --> 00:48:44,820
Unbelievable. I'm still in shock.

1404
00:48:44,821 --> 00:48:46,460
Two times in a row?

1405
00:48:46,461 --> 00:48:48,239
(Let me pay you some more.)

1406
00:48:48,520 --> 00:48:49,671
- You deserve it. - Thank you.

1407
00:48:50,131 --> 00:48:52,429
50 dollars. I earned so much.

1408
00:48:52,430 --> 00:48:54,199
Jae Seok has earned a lot.

1409
00:48:54,200 --> 00:48:55,760
(Jae Seok has been receiving fees.)

1410
00:48:55,761 --> 00:48:57,699
- 100 dollars. - 100 dollars?

1411
00:48:57,700 --> 00:48:58,869
- Which one? - That one.

1412
00:48:58,870 --> 00:49:01,539
(He tries the times 10 pop-up pirate so that he can escape at once.)

1413
00:49:01,540 --> 00:49:03,661
If I fail to escape after helping other people,

1414
00:49:03,711 --> 00:49:06,266
wouldn't that be hilarious?

1415
00:49:06,310 --> 00:49:08,309
- Right. - That means you're really unlucky.

1416
00:49:08,310 --> 00:49:09,579
(Will he be unlucky for himself too?)

1417
00:49:09,580 --> 00:49:11,679
It might not work for himself.

1418
00:49:11,680 --> 00:49:13,849
- Right. - Helping others is easier.

1419
00:49:13,850 --> 00:49:15,050
Put your face away.

1420
00:49:15,051 --> 00:49:16,090
(The first attempt fails.)

1421
00:49:16,250 --> 00:49:18,614
If it doesn't pop up, it means he is really unlucky.

1422
00:49:19,790 --> 00:49:21,276
It'll be so funny if it pops up.

1423
00:49:21,790 --> 00:49:24,558
If it pops up, give me the extra money.

1424
00:49:24,591 --> 00:49:25,789
50 dollars.

1425
00:49:25,790 --> 00:49:27,821
It's not popping up. Jae Seok is in trouble.

1426
00:49:29,401 --> 00:49:31,699
(What is going on?)

1427
00:49:31,700 --> 00:49:33,400
- Slow down. - Jae Seok, slow down.

1428
00:49:33,401 --> 00:49:34,499
Slow down.

1429
00:49:34,500 --> 00:49:36,940
Whether it pops up or not, it'll be funny.

1430
00:49:36,941 --> 00:49:38,183
How much did you bet? 100 dollars?

1431
00:49:38,810 --> 00:49:39,809
Please.

1432
00:49:39,810 --> 00:49:42,979
(Whenever he casually pointed at a slot, )

1433
00:49:42,980 --> 00:49:45,380
(the pirate popped up.)

1434
00:49:45,381 --> 00:49:50,339
(With only a 0.6 percent chance, he was right again.)

1435
00:49:50,850 --> 00:49:53,992
(He made history today as an unlucky man.)

1436
00:49:54,390 --> 00:49:59,530
(With 2 chances left, the pirate won't pop up for him.)

1437
00:49:59,531 --> 00:50:01,681
- Oh, my. - Only one left.

1438
00:50:02,330 --> 00:50:03,369
(Even the fourth attempt fails.)

1439
00:50:03,370 --> 00:50:04,400
Only one left.

1440
00:50:04,401 --> 00:50:06,570
(He has only one chance left.)

1441
00:50:06,571 --> 00:50:08,763
- Take a break. - Let's stay back.

1442
00:50:08,971 --> 00:50:10,961
- I'm so looking forward. - If it doesn't pop up...

1443
00:50:11,441 --> 00:50:13,197
You'll be humiliated.

1444
00:50:13,281 --> 00:50:15,402
It'll be so funny if it doesn't pop up.

1445
00:50:15,480 --> 00:50:17,096
If it pops up, it's a miracle.

1446
00:50:18,450 --> 00:50:21,005
(They all root for him.)

1447
00:50:21,321 --> 00:50:22,749
(If it pops up, he can escape.)

1448
00:50:22,750 --> 00:50:23,820
- It gives me goosebumps. - This must be it.

1449
00:50:23,821 --> 00:50:25,220
- Stick it in. - This must be it.

1450
00:50:25,221 --> 00:50:27,159
- Stick it in. - Please.

1451
00:50:27,160 --> 00:50:31,437
(What will happen to the unlucky Jae Seok?)

1452
00:50:31,746 --> 00:50:34,574
(Last chance to win 1,000 dollars)

1453
00:50:34,771 --> 00:50:36,199
(If it pops up, he can escape.)

1454
00:50:36,200 --> 00:50:37,270
- It gives me goosebumps. - This must be it.

1455
00:50:37,271 --> 00:50:38,670
- Stick it in. - This must be it.

1456
00:50:38,671 --> 00:50:40,609
- Stick it in. - Please.

1457
00:50:40,610 --> 00:50:43,093
(What will happen to the unlucky Jae Seok?)

1458
00:50:43,094 --> 00:50:46,973
(It popped up.)

1459
00:50:48,165 --> 00:50:51,669
(Jae Seok wins 1,000 dollars and escapes.)

1460
00:50:52,944 --> 00:50:57,590
(Jae Seok succeeded 3 times in a row.)

1461
00:50:58,674 --> 00:51:00,766
- I'm not joking. I got goosebumps. - This is crazy.

1462
00:51:01,685 --> 00:51:04,311
(They all become speechless.)

1463
00:51:05,114 --> 00:51:07,923
(This is more dramatic than any movie.)

1464
00:51:07,924 --> 00:51:09,823
- Gosh. Yu Jae Seok! - Are you crazy?

1465
00:51:09,824 --> 00:51:11,370
- Yu Jae Seok! - How can this happen?

1466
00:51:12,225 --> 00:51:13,880
- Jae Seok. How... - How...

1467
00:51:13,924 --> 00:51:15,410
I'm on fire today.

1468
00:51:16,035 --> 00:51:17,983
I should buy a lottery ticket.

1469
00:51:18,495 --> 00:51:19,664
I have no time to waste.

1470
00:51:19,665 --> 00:51:20,715
(This would be harder than winning a lottery.)

1471
00:51:20,835 --> 00:51:22,064
Jae Seok, go get Kwang Soo.

1472
00:51:22,065 --> 00:51:23,733
I'll get going. I'll get Kwang Soo.

1473
00:51:23,734 --> 00:51:25,289
- Bye. - See you.

1474
00:51:26,074 --> 00:51:27,403
- Is this for real? - This is crazy.

1475
00:51:27,404 --> 00:51:28,443
(Did we just dream?)

1476
00:51:28,444 --> 00:51:29,585
How can this be possible?

1477
00:51:29,975 --> 00:51:31,630
(I want to escape too.)

1478
00:51:32,174 --> 00:51:33,784
- Please turn in your cell phone. - What?

1479
00:51:33,785 --> 00:51:35,414
- Turn in your cell phone. - Why?

1480
00:51:35,415 --> 00:51:37,113
(Jae Seok has to turn in his phone too.)

1481
00:51:37,114 --> 00:51:38,529
Let me blindfold you.

1482
00:51:38,984 --> 00:51:41,054
(He is blindfolded so he can't see anything.)

1483
00:51:41,055 --> 00:51:42,423
- Should I get in? - Yes.

1484
00:51:42,424 --> 00:51:45,093
(He is transported to the 100 Minute House.)

1485
00:51:45,094 --> 00:51:46,538
Where are we going?

1486
00:51:48,665 --> 00:51:50,034
- So Min. - Okay.

1487
00:51:50,035 --> 00:51:51,363
100 dollars, cups.

1488
00:51:51,364 --> 00:51:53,403
They must have been shuffled, right? 1, 2, 3.

1489
00:51:53,404 --> 00:51:55,003
(She bets everything on the cups.)

1490
00:51:55,004 --> 00:51:56,954
Okay. 1, 2, 3.

1491
00:51:57,234 --> 00:51:58,773
(She wins 300 dollars at once.)

1492
00:51:58,774 --> 00:51:59,815
Stop!

1493
00:52:00,004 --> 00:52:01,287
I'll switch to pop-up pirate.

1494
00:52:01,605 --> 00:52:02,814
I'll switch to pop-up pirate.

1495
00:52:02,815 --> 00:52:04,644
(She bets everything on the times 5 pop-up pirate.)

1496
00:52:04,645 --> 00:52:06,483
- I don't think it'll pop up. - So Min.

1497
00:52:06,484 --> 00:52:07,726
The last one...

1498
00:52:08,185 --> 00:52:12,225
(So Min wins 1,000 dollars and escapes.)

1499
00:52:12,984 --> 00:52:14,084
What is this?

1500
00:52:14,085 --> 00:52:15,354
(Wait for me, Kwang Soo and Jae Seok.)

1501
00:52:15,355 --> 00:52:16,435
- Here? - Yes.

1502
00:52:17,725 --> 00:52:18,753
Where...

1503
00:52:18,754 --> 00:52:21,350
(Kwang Soo, Jae Seok, and So Min have escaped the betting house.)

1504
00:52:21,895 --> 00:52:23,854
What is this? Where am I?

1505
00:52:24,364 --> 00:52:26,889
Where... I'm scared. I'm indoors.

1506
00:52:27,165 --> 00:52:28,245
Where am I?

1507
00:52:28,605 --> 00:52:29,989
How did she come here?

1508
00:52:30,134 --> 00:52:32,633
- How did she come here? - How did So Min come here?

1509
00:52:32,634 --> 00:52:34,573
- What is this? - So Min, how did you come here?

1510
00:52:34,574 --> 00:52:36,613
What's going on? There's nothing here.

1511
00:52:36,614 --> 00:52:37,773
Hold on.

1512
00:52:37,774 --> 00:52:39,443
What's going on? Why am I being locked up?

1513
00:52:39,444 --> 00:52:41,014
So Min, how did you come?

1514
00:52:41,015 --> 00:52:42,298
What is this?

1515
00:52:42,585 --> 00:52:44,814
Jae Seok! What is this place?

1516
00:52:44,815 --> 00:52:45,883
(So Min is the 3rd person to arrive here.)

1517
00:52:45,884 --> 00:52:46,954
What is this?

1518
00:52:46,955 --> 00:52:48,084
(So Min has 88 minutes.)

1519
00:52:48,085 --> 00:52:49,084
Do I have to answer them?

1520
00:52:49,085 --> 00:52:51,724
"Find the similarity among these three."

1521
00:52:51,725 --> 00:52:53,023
I've seen this poem somewhere,

1522
00:52:53,024 --> 00:52:55,520
- but I don't remember where. - "Itaewon has it, but..."

1523
00:52:55,625 --> 00:52:58,593
I think I learned this poem back in high school.

1524
00:52:58,594 --> 00:53:00,804
"Itaewon has it..." I should start from question number one.

1525
00:53:00,805 --> 00:53:02,804
"Itaewon has it, but Apgujeong doesn't."

1526
00:53:02,805 --> 00:53:05,403
Let me give you a hint about number one. It's simple.

1527
00:53:05,404 --> 00:53:07,929
(20 minutes pass, and the 1st hint is given.)

1528
00:53:08,375 --> 00:53:11,613
It's related to public transport.

1529
00:53:11,614 --> 00:53:13,706
- Public transport. - "Public transport"?

1530
00:53:14,915 --> 00:53:16,571
Bus, subway, taxi...

1531
00:53:18,055 --> 00:53:21,224
(Public transport?)

1532
00:53:21,225 --> 00:53:23,023
It can't be taxis. Buses...

1533
00:53:23,024 --> 00:53:24,293
(Jae Seok is lost.)

1534
00:53:24,294 --> 00:53:25,435
I know what number one is.

1535
00:53:26,225 --> 00:53:28,315
- I know what number one is! - Hey.

1536
00:53:28,395 --> 00:53:30,494
Let me answer!

1537
00:53:30,495 --> 00:53:31,593
It's near my place.

1538
00:53:31,594 --> 00:53:32,834
- Let me answer. - Hold on.

1539
00:53:32,835 --> 00:53:34,350
- Let me answer. - All right.

1540
00:53:34,464 --> 00:53:36,604
- So Min's answer is correct. - Okay!

1541
00:53:36,605 --> 00:53:38,049
So Min!

1542
00:53:38,375 --> 00:53:40,343
- Really? - Hey!

1543
00:53:40,344 --> 00:53:41,503
- Okay! - Hey!

1544
00:53:41,504 --> 00:53:42,514
Question number one.

1545
00:53:43,315 --> 00:53:44,514
Question number one.

1546
00:53:44,515 --> 00:53:45,514
(Subway Line 6)

1547
00:53:45,515 --> 00:53:47,333
- Correct! - Okay!

1548
00:53:47,614 --> 00:53:48,713
Jae Seok!

1549
00:53:48,714 --> 00:53:51,084
(Kwang Soo came first, but he is the only one left now.)

1550
00:53:51,085 --> 00:53:54,013
- Jae Seok! What's the answer? - I'm done.

1551
00:53:54,424 --> 00:53:55,753
(Itaewon has it, but Apgujeong doesn't.)

1552
00:53:55,754 --> 00:53:58,193
(Hyochang Park has it, but Children's Grand Park doesn't.)

1553
00:53:58,194 --> 00:53:59,193
(World Cup Stadium, Hyochang Park, Itaewon)

1554
00:53:59,194 --> 00:54:01,547
(Subway Line 6)

1555
00:54:01,594 --> 00:54:03,093
Bus, subway, taxi...

1556
00:54:03,094 --> 00:54:04,494
(What's the answer?)

1557
00:54:04,495 --> 00:54:07,938
(Does Kwang Soo know now?)

1558
00:54:09,774 --> 00:54:10,804
Let me answer.

1559
00:54:10,805 --> 00:54:12,188
(A churro shop)

1560
00:54:12,844 --> 00:54:14,343
I'm sure this is it.

1561
00:54:14,344 --> 00:54:15,804
(Itaewon has a churro shop, but Apgujeong doesn't?)

1562
00:54:15,805 --> 00:54:17,391
Your answer is wrong.

1563
00:54:18,145 --> 00:54:19,225
Is it close?

1564
00:54:20,384 --> 00:54:22,684
(He tries again right away.)

1565
00:54:22,685 --> 00:54:23,753
Let me answer.

1566
00:54:23,754 --> 00:54:24,914
(A fish-shaped bun shop)

1567
00:54:24,915 --> 00:54:26,198
Your answer is wrong.

1568
00:54:28,524 --> 00:54:30,523
(He tries yet again.)

1569
00:54:30,524 --> 00:54:31,624
Let me answer.

1570
00:54:31,625 --> 00:54:34,150
(A convenience store)

1571
00:54:35,065 --> 00:54:38,133
(Kwang Soo continues to give the wrong answer.)

1572
00:54:38,134 --> 00:54:40,528
What is this?

1573
00:54:40,935 --> 00:54:42,046
Where are we going?

1574
00:54:43,875 --> 00:54:45,173
Where am I?

1575
00:54:45,174 --> 00:54:46,704
(Seok Jin has 77 minutes.)

1576
00:54:46,705 --> 00:54:47,715
What is this?

1577
00:54:48,274 --> 00:54:49,514
Where am I?

1578
00:54:49,515 --> 00:54:51,130
Gosh, this is so sudden.

1579
00:54:52,714 --> 00:54:54,043
What is this?

1580
00:54:54,044 --> 00:54:55,095
(Time is passing by.)

1581
00:54:55,344 --> 00:54:57,054
Why can't I do this?

1582
00:54:57,055 --> 00:54:59,354
You have 500 dollars. How much do you want to bet?

1583
00:54:59,355 --> 00:55:00,554
- Bet 200 dollars. - Bet 200 dollars.

1584
00:55:00,555 --> 00:55:02,184
I bet 200 dollars.

1585
00:55:02,185 --> 00:55:03,854
- Give us the extra money. - Seriously...

1586
00:55:03,855 --> 00:55:05,440
- Okay. - You're my sister-in-law.

1587
00:55:06,324 --> 00:55:09,193
"Sister-in-law"? Did you say, "sister-in-law"?

1588
00:55:09,194 --> 00:55:10,407
My sister-in-law.

1589
00:55:10,895 --> 00:55:12,334
- Just a second, my brother-in-law. - Okay.

1590
00:55:12,335 --> 00:55:14,704
(Just a second, my brother-in-law.)

1591
00:55:14,705 --> 00:55:16,351
She's playing along.

1592
00:55:16,705 --> 00:55:18,773
Ji Hyo is playing along.

1593
00:55:18,774 --> 00:55:20,360
Which slot do you want?

1594
00:55:20,605 --> 00:55:21,874
You can decide.

1595
00:55:21,875 --> 00:55:23,144
(You can decide.)

1596
00:55:23,145 --> 00:55:24,428
You're good at this.

1597
00:55:24,614 --> 00:55:26,173
(What are they doing?)

1598
00:55:26,174 --> 00:55:27,314
I like this one.

1599
00:55:27,315 --> 00:55:28,514
(This is her 1st attempt out of 5.)

1600
00:55:28,515 --> 00:55:30,333
(It pops up.)

1601
00:55:32,214 --> 00:55:33,684
(1 shot, 1 kill)

1602
00:55:33,685 --> 00:55:35,542
How do you do this?

1603
00:55:36,455 --> 00:55:39,485
(How do you do this?)

1604
00:55:41,165 --> 00:55:43,264
- Sister-in-law. - Brother-in-law.

1605
00:55:43,265 --> 00:55:44,363
My goodness.

1606
00:55:44,364 --> 00:55:46,253
- I'm so surprised. - You have 300 dollars left.

1607
00:55:46,605 --> 00:55:49,463
- All right. - You have 300 dollars left.

1608
00:55:49,504 --> 00:55:50,918
Please divide it up.

1609
00:55:51,074 --> 00:55:52,173
I have 300 dollars left?

1610
00:55:52,174 --> 00:55:53,804
- Honey. - "Honey"?

1611
00:55:53,805 --> 00:55:54,804
(Honey)

1612
00:55:54,805 --> 00:55:56,474
- Honey. - "Honey"?

1613
00:55:56,475 --> 00:55:59,746
(He plays along to win 300 dollars.)

1614
00:56:00,285 --> 00:56:02,244
(He called Ji Hyo "honey" to win the 300 dollars.)

1615
00:56:02,245 --> 00:56:03,326
Jong Kook.

1616
00:56:04,055 --> 00:56:05,530
"Honey"?

1617
00:56:06,015 --> 00:56:07,153
"Honey"?

1618
00:56:07,154 --> 00:56:08,153
(The brother-in-law is satisfied.)

1619
00:56:08,154 --> 00:56:09,164
Honey.

1620
00:56:09,455 --> 00:56:10,807
You're so good.

1621
00:56:11,395 --> 00:56:12,523
- You're so good. - "Honey".

1622
00:56:12,524 --> 00:56:14,793
"Honey". We can't beat that.

1623
00:56:14,794 --> 00:56:16,684
Fine. Honey, you can have 300 dollars.

1624
00:56:17,464 --> 00:56:18,494
Good!

1625
00:56:18,495 --> 00:56:19,979
(Honey, you can have 300 dollars.)

1626
00:56:20,734 --> 00:56:22,064
(Good words cost nothing but are worth much.)

1627
00:56:22,065 --> 00:56:23,073
(Good words can be worth 300 dollars.)

1628
00:56:23,074 --> 00:56:24,534
- This is it. - Jong Kook.

1629
00:56:24,535 --> 00:56:25,949
Are they a couple?

1630
00:56:26,404 --> 00:56:28,043
Give me 100 dollars.

1631
00:56:28,044 --> 00:56:29,073
(Ji Hyo escapes, and it's Se Chan's turn now.)

1632
00:56:29,074 --> 00:56:30,185
Here we go.

1633
00:56:30,714 --> 00:56:31,713
I have to catch up.

1634
00:56:31,714 --> 00:56:33,057
(Se Chan has 480 dollars.)

1635
00:56:33,844 --> 00:56:36,340
It'd be funny if it didn't pop up.

1636
00:56:36,515 --> 00:56:38,483
(Popping)

1637
00:56:38,484 --> 00:56:40,284
(It pops up.)

1638
00:56:40,285 --> 00:56:41,323
Okay!

1639
00:56:41,324 --> 00:56:42,724
(He gets 1,000 dollars and a total of 1,280 dollars.)

1640
00:56:42,725 --> 00:56:43,907
What was that?

1641
00:56:44,594 --> 00:56:45,705
All right. How much do you have?

1642
00:56:46,594 --> 00:56:48,038
- Let's make it fair. - I have 750 dollars.

1643
00:56:48,464 --> 00:56:49,633
- 750 dollars? - Yes.

1644
00:56:49,634 --> 00:56:51,857
If I give him 250 dollars, it's a game over. Let's go.

1645
00:56:51,995 --> 00:56:53,783
- What? - I'll give it to you.

1646
00:56:54,165 --> 00:56:56,934
(Se Chan willingly gives Jong Kook the money.)

1647
00:56:56,935 --> 00:56:59,874
- All right, let's see. - Hold on. Okay.

1648
00:56:59,875 --> 00:57:01,073
- Here's 250 dollars. - Okay.

1649
00:57:01,074 --> 00:57:02,822
- Let's go. - All right.

1650
00:57:03,214 --> 00:57:05,414
We were a team in the morning.

1651
00:57:05,415 --> 00:57:07,784
- All right! - Good.

1652
00:57:07,785 --> 00:57:09,673
Haha, here's 30 dollars.

1653
00:57:09,855 --> 00:57:10,883
- You can do it. - Okay.

1654
00:57:10,884 --> 00:57:11,925
- Okay. - Jong Kook.

1655
00:57:12,085 --> 00:57:14,781
You took my money before. You deserve it.

1656
00:57:15,884 --> 00:57:18,420
(He's all alone once again.)

1657
00:57:18,654 --> 00:57:20,140
Dawn club!

1658
00:57:21,924 --> 00:57:23,264
(Sighing)

1659
00:57:23,265 --> 00:57:24,375
Darn it.

1660
00:57:24,895 --> 00:57:26,503
This is just my luck.

1661
00:57:26,504 --> 00:57:27,818
(He might leave at dawn.)

1662
00:57:28,305 --> 00:57:30,673
Can I go? Can I go in?

1663
00:57:30,674 --> 00:57:32,133
(Ji Hyo is the fifth to arrive.)

1664
00:57:32,134 --> 00:57:33,417
I hear something. What is that?

1665
00:57:34,444 --> 00:57:36,162
She got out early.

1666
00:57:37,214 --> 00:57:38,224
Goodness.

1667
00:57:38,714 --> 00:57:39,744
What is this?

1668
00:57:39,745 --> 00:57:41,043
(She has 72 minutes.)

1669
00:57:41,044 --> 00:57:42,095
What is this?

1670
00:57:42,614 --> 00:57:43,883
- Who is it? - Hey.

1671
00:57:43,884 --> 00:57:46,483
(She has to solve the two questions in the given time.)

1672
00:57:46,484 --> 00:57:48,374
- What's going on? - Jong Kook's here.

1673
00:57:49,055 --> 00:57:50,104
Se Chan.

1674
00:57:51,194 --> 00:57:53,084
Where am I? Do I enter? What do I do?

1675
00:57:53,424 --> 00:57:54,724
(Jong Kook and Se Chan have 71 minutes.)

1676
00:57:54,725 --> 00:57:56,733
- It's locked. - Goodness.

1677
00:57:56,734 --> 00:57:59,034
None of you guys who came here first got to leave?

1678
00:57:59,035 --> 00:58:01,133
- No, we couldn't. - This is the 100 Minute House.

1679
00:58:01,134 --> 00:58:03,731
- Look at this. - 10 dollars is reduced per minute.

1680
00:58:03,774 --> 00:58:05,653
30 minutes have passed already.

1681
00:58:05,875 --> 00:58:07,104
Did the others leave?

1682
00:58:07,105 --> 00:58:09,125
- No. - None of them?

1683
00:58:09,174 --> 00:58:10,993
"Find the similarity among these three."

1684
00:58:11,015 --> 00:58:12,054
What is this?

1685
00:58:12,774 --> 00:58:14,461
The first question is easy.

1686
00:58:14,844 --> 00:58:17,037
- Did you get it? - Yes.

1687
00:58:17,154 --> 00:58:18,584
- It's easy? - It is?

1688
00:58:18,585 --> 00:58:20,483
It's extremely easy.

1689
00:58:20,484 --> 00:58:22,808
It's near my place.

1690
00:58:23,524 --> 00:58:25,039
Can you give me a hint?

1691
00:58:25,094 --> 00:58:26,841
If you take the subway, you'll know.

1692
00:58:27,024 --> 00:58:28,363
- What? - Oh, my.

1693
00:58:28,364 --> 00:58:30,920
(Is the subway the hint?)

1694
00:58:32,065 --> 00:58:33,934
(She accidentally discloses a crucial hint.)

1695
00:58:33,935 --> 00:58:35,034
I accidentally told them.

1696
00:58:35,035 --> 00:58:36,233
(She accidentally discloses a crucial hint.)

1697
00:58:36,234 --> 00:58:37,316
The subway?

1698
00:58:37,835 --> 00:58:39,434
(Jong Kook thinks about...)

1699
00:58:39,435 --> 00:58:42,604
(the subway map.)

1700
00:58:42,605 --> 00:58:44,665
(He successfully does it.)

1701
00:58:45,875 --> 00:58:48,369
Is this right? Let me answer.

1702
00:58:48,915 --> 00:58:51,113
Room 6's answer to the 1st question is correct.

1703
00:58:51,114 --> 00:58:52,784
Okay! Goodness.

1704
00:58:52,785 --> 00:58:54,184
Seriously? Room six?

1705
00:58:54,185 --> 00:58:55,497
(He can't believe it.)

1706
00:58:56,254 --> 00:58:57,554
(To make it worse, )

1707
00:58:57,555 --> 00:59:00,164
- Here. - Room 4's answer is correct.

1708
00:59:00,165 --> 00:59:01,508
(even Seok Jin gets it.)

1709
00:59:02,565 --> 00:59:04,593
Room 6's answer to the 1st question is correct.

1710
00:59:04,594 --> 00:59:07,334
Okay! Goodness.

1711
00:59:07,335 --> 00:59:09,587
What is the answer? What about Itaewon?

1712
00:59:09,634 --> 00:59:11,633
You came here first.

1713
00:59:11,634 --> 00:59:13,704
You even received the hint.

1714
00:59:13,705 --> 00:59:14,974
I have no idea.

1715
00:59:14,975 --> 00:59:16,964
It's the same subway line.

1716
00:59:17,844 --> 00:59:21,144
The subway line. Goodness.

1717
00:59:21,145 --> 00:59:23,478
(He has practically told him everything.)

1718
00:59:24,754 --> 00:59:25,784
Let me answer.

1719
00:59:25,785 --> 00:59:27,068
(Thanks, Jae Seok.)

1720
00:59:28,725 --> 00:59:29,724
Let me answer.

1721
00:59:29,725 --> 00:59:31,593
(Subway Line 1)

1722
00:59:31,594 --> 00:59:33,463
It's very similar.

1723
00:59:33,464 --> 00:59:36,934
- Really? - He came first and is still here.

1724
00:59:36,935 --> 00:59:38,511
I even gave him the hint.

1725
00:59:38,995 --> 00:59:40,014
Let me answer.

1726
00:59:40,134 --> 00:59:41,304
(He gets it wrong again.)

1727
00:59:41,305 --> 00:59:42,304
(He gets drenched.)

1728
00:59:42,305 --> 00:59:43,345
Hold on.

1729
00:59:44,035 --> 00:59:45,034
(Subway Line 3)

1730
00:59:45,035 --> 00:59:46,073
Let me answer.

1731
00:59:46,074 --> 00:59:47,244
(He's determined to keep guessing.)

1732
00:59:47,245 --> 00:59:48,386
Pour it on me!

1733
00:59:49,305 --> 00:59:50,354
Let me answer.

1734
00:59:50,515 --> 00:59:51,757
(He's wrong again.)

1735
00:59:52,145 --> 00:59:54,284
Keep pouring. Do it.

1736
00:59:54,285 --> 00:59:56,001
(It seems like he's enjoying it.)

1737
00:59:57,585 --> 00:59:58,624
Let me answer!

1738
00:59:58,955 --> 01:00:00,483
(He's wrong once again.)

1739
01:00:00,484 --> 01:00:02,983
How many lines are there?

1740
01:00:02,984 --> 01:00:04,124
(Hang in there.)

1741
01:00:04,125 --> 01:00:06,074
(She can't believe he's writing every single one.)

1742
01:00:06,395 --> 01:00:07,423
Then...

1743
01:00:07,424 --> 01:00:08,506
(He finally writes the right one.)

1744
01:00:08,565 --> 01:00:09,604
Let me answer!

1745
01:00:10,194 --> 01:00:12,487
- That's correct. - Okay!

1746
01:00:14,234 --> 01:00:16,597
(Thank goodness it wasn't Subway Line 9.)

1747
01:00:17,875 --> 01:00:20,043
Hold on. The poet?

1748
01:00:20,044 --> 01:00:21,054
The poet.

1749
01:00:21,904 --> 01:00:22,974
I have no idea.

1750
01:00:22,975 --> 01:00:24,530
(Room 8 has yet to welcome its owner.)

1751
01:00:24,815 --> 01:00:25,843
Here I go.

1752
01:00:25,844 --> 01:00:27,713
(The owner is still wrestling with paper cups.)

1753
01:00:27,714 --> 01:00:29,664
(He's wrong.)

1754
01:00:31,315 --> 01:00:32,514
(He decides to switch categories.)

1755
01:00:32,515 --> 01:00:33,523
Here I go.

1756
01:00:33,524 --> 01:00:34,534
(He decides to switch categories.)

1757
01:00:34,785 --> 01:00:36,098
How do I do this?

1758
01:00:36,424 --> 01:00:39,626
How do you do this? Gosh.

1759
01:00:39,794 --> 01:00:41,224
(He'll be here before the 100 minutes are up, right?)

1760
01:00:41,225 --> 01:00:42,494
Is Haha here?

1761
01:00:42,495 --> 01:00:43,645
(He'll be here before the 100 minutes are up, right?)

1762
01:00:44,395 --> 01:00:45,894
I want to know the answer to the second question.

1763
01:00:45,895 --> 01:00:47,503
(Whoever gets it right wins.)

1764
01:00:47,504 --> 01:00:50,333
“On a distant day, when the skies first opened,”

1765
01:00:50,774 --> 01:00:52,604
“Somewhere a cock must have crowed.”

1766
01:00:52,605 --> 01:00:54,018
(Who is the poet of this poem?)

1767
01:00:54,245 --> 01:00:55,961
You all know this poet.

1768
01:00:56,544 --> 01:00:57,929
Really?

1769
01:00:58,145 --> 01:00:59,761
Here is your second hint.

1770
01:01:00,415 --> 01:01:02,514
This poet is a national poet.

1771
01:01:02,515 --> 01:01:03,613
Really?

1772
01:01:03,614 --> 01:01:06,957
(2nd hint: national poet)

1773
01:01:07,055 --> 01:01:08,974
- National poet? - National poet?

1774
01:01:10,725 --> 01:01:13,023
National? National poet?

1775
01:01:13,024 --> 01:01:15,549
(Yi Yuk Sa, Yun Dong Ju, Sim Hun, Baek Seok, Kim So Wol...)

1776
01:01:16,024 --> 01:01:18,664
(This poem was written...)

1777
01:01:18,665 --> 01:01:22,946
(by Yi Yuk Sa and was named "The Wide Plain".)

1778
01:01:23,504 --> 01:01:26,233
(Yi Yuk Sa: He got his nickname from his prisoner number, 264.)

1779
01:01:26,234 --> 01:01:28,799
(He wrote "The Wide Plain", "Green Grapes", and "A Tall Tree".)

1780
01:01:29,044 --> 01:01:30,043
National? National poet?

1781
01:01:30,044 --> 01:01:31,974
(The poem is called "The Wide Plain".)

1782
01:01:31,975 --> 01:01:33,443
What is this?

1783
01:01:33,444 --> 01:01:34,443
(The answer is Yi Yuk Sa.)

1784
01:01:34,444 --> 01:01:36,676
- I can't remember it. - Who is this poet?

1785
01:01:36,855 --> 01:01:39,005
The moment you hear this poet's name,

1786
01:01:39,055 --> 01:01:41,711
- you will recognize him. - Really?

1787
01:01:42,324 --> 01:01:44,454
All right. The answer is...

1788
01:01:44,455 --> 01:01:46,414
(Jae Seok jots something down.)

1789
01:01:47,424 --> 01:01:48,910
Hold on. A poet?

1790
01:01:50,535 --> 01:01:53,704
(Did he write the correct answer?)

1791
01:01:53,705 --> 01:01:54,863
(Yi Yuk Sa)

1792
01:01:54,864 --> 01:01:55,863
(He did.)

1793
01:01:55,864 --> 01:01:57,573
(Yi Yuk Sa)

1794
01:01:57,574 --> 01:02:01,403
Room 2's answer to the 2nd question is correct.

1795
01:02:01,404 --> 01:02:02,414
You are free.

1796
01:02:02,904 --> 01:02:04,531
- What? - What?

1797
01:02:04,944 --> 01:02:06,834
- What? - Who?

1798
01:02:06,884 --> 01:02:08,543
- Who got it? - Who?

1799
01:02:08,544 --> 01:02:09,914
- Who was it? - Am I right?

1800
01:02:09,915 --> 01:02:11,314
- Who got it? - What happened?

1801
01:02:11,315 --> 01:02:13,014
- It's Jae Seok. - Who?

1802
01:02:13,015 --> 01:02:15,423
- Who got it? - I think it's Jae Seok.

1803
01:02:15,424 --> 01:02:16,554
Is the poet really that famous?

1804
01:02:16,555 --> 01:02:17,753
- What? - Is he famous?

1805
01:02:17,754 --> 01:02:19,793
Okay! Yes, he is.

1806
01:02:19,794 --> 01:02:21,224
- Who is it? - Jae Seok,

1807
01:02:21,225 --> 01:02:23,356
- tell me. - Me too, please.

1808
01:02:24,265 --> 01:02:25,434
(What?)

1809
01:02:25,435 --> 01:02:27,627
Is it not over? I don't think it is.

1810
01:02:28,464 --> 01:02:30,974
(The staff hands Jae Seok...)

1811
01:02:30,975 --> 01:02:34,539
(his final mission.)

1812
01:02:34,645 --> 01:02:35,704
(He thought it was over.)

1813
01:02:35,705 --> 01:02:36,755
What is this?

1814
01:02:39,074 --> 01:02:40,559
Goodness.

1815
01:02:41,015 --> 01:02:42,014
What?

1816
01:02:42,015 --> 01:02:44,213
(The first four to escape are runaways. Protect your name tag.)

1817
01:02:44,214 --> 01:02:45,713
How could you do this?

1818
01:02:45,714 --> 01:02:46,724
(He needs to run.)

1819
01:02:46,725 --> 01:02:47,936
Wait.

1820
01:02:48,654 --> 01:02:49,836
Gosh!

1821
01:02:50,625 --> 01:02:52,724
How could you do this?

1822
01:02:52,725 --> 01:02:53,724
What is it?

1823
01:02:53,725 --> 01:02:54,764
(Curious)

1824
01:02:54,765 --> 01:02:56,885
What's wrong? What is it?

1825
01:02:56,964 --> 01:02:58,633
Gosh, this is driving me crazy.

1826
01:02:58,634 --> 01:02:59,963
(Where should I go?)

1827
01:02:59,964 --> 01:03:01,233
(The most important thing is, )

1828
01:03:01,234 --> 01:03:02,903
Jong Kook needs to escape soon.

1829
01:03:02,904 --> 01:03:04,003
(Jong Kook cannot become a chaser.)

1830
01:03:04,004 --> 01:03:05,133
He can't.

1831
01:03:05,134 --> 01:03:06,620
(Jong Kook cannot become a chaser.)

1832
01:03:07,544 --> 01:03:09,744
Gosh, who is this poet?

1833
01:03:09,745 --> 01:03:10,784
Who is it?

1834
01:03:11,645 --> 01:03:12,827
I don't know.

1835
01:03:13,645 --> 01:03:14,983
(Kwang Soo peeps into Jae Seok's room.)

1836
01:03:14,984 --> 01:03:16,514
So Min, I don't know this one.

1837
01:03:16,515 --> 01:03:17,525
(Jae Seok's whiteboard is there.)

1838
01:03:18,654 --> 01:03:20,947
(Fidgeting)

1839
01:03:21,685 --> 01:03:25,023
(He suddenly ties the towels.)

1840
01:03:25,024 --> 01:03:27,664
Was I not close at all?

1841
01:03:27,665 --> 01:03:29,341
(He puts his head into Jae Seok's room.)

1842
01:03:30,165 --> 01:03:33,164
(Through the small opening that connects to the next room, )

1843
01:03:33,234 --> 01:03:35,434
(he uses the towel...)

1844
01:03:35,435 --> 01:03:38,637
(to flip the whiteboard.)

1845
01:03:39,404 --> 01:03:42,104
(He lifts it...)

1846
01:03:42,105 --> 01:03:44,972
(but fails to flip it.)

1847
01:03:45,475 --> 01:03:47,768
(Focused)

1848
01:03:48,245 --> 01:03:50,113
(He successfully catches the corner.)

1849
01:03:50,114 --> 01:03:51,297
I heard it!

1850
01:03:52,154 --> 01:03:54,002
(Unfortunately, it slips.)

1851
01:03:55,355 --> 01:03:58,121
(He's determined to escape.)

1852
01:03:59,024 --> 01:04:01,494
(A hand appears.)

1853
01:04:01,495 --> 01:04:04,193
(Whose hand does this belong to?)

1854
01:04:04,194 --> 01:04:06,193
I'll hold this part.

1855
01:04:06,194 --> 01:04:07,334
(So Min comes to his aid.)

1856
01:04:07,335 --> 01:04:08,980
I'll read it.

1857
01:04:09,035 --> 01:04:11,801
After you flip it, I'll read it.

1858
01:04:12,105 --> 01:04:13,417
Hold on.

1859
01:04:13,544 --> 01:04:16,244
- Go a bit back. - Put it over there.

1860
01:04:16,245 --> 01:04:17,613
(Suddenly)

1861
01:04:17,614 --> 01:04:19,244
(The whiteboard's owner appears.)

1862
01:04:19,245 --> 01:04:21,843
- Jae Seok. Hey. - Jae Seok.

1863
01:04:21,844 --> 01:04:24,784
(Please don't.)

1864
01:04:24,785 --> 01:04:25,784
(Don't take it.)

1865
01:04:25,785 --> 01:04:26,954
Please don't take it.

1866
01:04:26,955 --> 01:04:29,354
- Please! No! - Please don't.

1867
01:04:29,355 --> 01:04:30,971
- Jae Seok, please. - No!

1868
01:04:30,995 --> 01:04:33,044
No! Jae Seok, please!

1869
01:04:34,495 --> 01:04:35,494
(He was close.)

1870
01:04:35,495 --> 01:04:37,515
Jae Seok, please.

1871
01:04:37,694 --> 01:04:38,934
Give us a hint.

1872
01:04:38,935 --> 01:04:41,329
Jae Seok, is the poet's name 1 word or 2 words?

1873
01:04:41,904 --> 01:04:43,895
What should I do? My goodness.

1874
01:04:44,574 --> 01:04:46,573
I had no idea I'd come last.

1875
01:04:46,574 --> 01:04:48,059
(An hour has passed since the 100 Minute House began.)

1876
01:04:48,504 --> 01:04:50,144
- Hey. - What's going on?

1877
01:04:50,145 --> 01:04:51,225
(Finally, Haha joins them.)

1878
01:04:51,344 --> 01:04:53,883
- Haha, you will never get this. - Yes?

1879
01:04:53,884 --> 01:04:54,943
What is it?

1880
01:04:54,944 --> 01:04:57,237
(He takes his blindfold off and looks around.)

1881
01:04:57,685 --> 01:04:58,814
Hold on.

1882
01:04:58,815 --> 01:04:59,825
(What is this?)

1883
01:05:00,585 --> 01:05:01,624
Can I start?

1884
01:05:01,625 --> 01:05:03,253
(Just when he's about to solve it...)

1885
01:05:03,254 --> 01:05:06,054
Let me watch from afar and see who escapes next.

1886
01:05:06,055 --> 01:05:07,394
(Jae Seok decides to watch them.)

1887
01:05:07,395 --> 01:05:09,040
What should I do?

1888
01:05:10,134 --> 01:05:11,205
Goodness.

1889
01:05:12,335 --> 01:05:14,503
I need to help Jong Kook escape.

1890
01:05:14,504 --> 01:05:18,974
(In order to make Jong Kook a fellow runaway, he must help him.)

1891
01:05:18,975 --> 01:05:20,244
(Yi)

1892
01:05:20,245 --> 01:05:21,244
(Yuk)

1893
01:05:21,245 --> 01:05:23,567
(Sa)

1894
01:05:24,344 --> 01:05:26,032
Darn it.

1895
01:05:27,285 --> 01:05:28,843
I can't think of any.

1896
01:05:28,844 --> 01:05:31,113
(He keeps signaling until Jong Kook notices.)

1897
01:05:31,114 --> 01:05:32,514
(However, Kwang Soo catches a glimpse of him.)

1898
01:05:32,515 --> 01:05:34,373
I'm sure I know the answer.

1899
01:05:34,555 --> 01:05:37,823
(Jong Kook, please look at me.)

1900
01:05:37,824 --> 01:05:40,164
(Another person spots Jae Seok.)

1901
01:05:40,165 --> 01:05:42,494
(It's Seok Jin.)

1902
01:05:42,495 --> 01:05:43,764
- Hold on. - Gosh.

1903
01:05:43,765 --> 01:05:46,034
(The two immediately write down their answers.)

1904
01:05:46,035 --> 01:05:47,704
I have no idea.

1905
01:05:47,705 --> 01:05:49,321
- Let me answer. - I did my best.

1906
01:05:50,734 --> 01:05:52,119
(He's quick-witted.)

1907
01:05:52,805 --> 01:05:56,138
Room 1's answer to the 2nd question is correct.

1908
01:05:57,444 --> 01:05:59,363
Here! Let me answer!

1909
01:06:00,074 --> 01:06:02,105
Room 4's answer to the 2nd question is correct.

1910
01:06:03,855 --> 01:06:05,113
(They both got it right?)

1911
01:06:05,114 --> 01:06:06,265
What is it?

1912
01:06:06,754 --> 01:06:07,795
What happened?

1913
01:06:09,384 --> 01:06:11,677
(I didn't mean for this to happen.)

1914
01:06:13,125 --> 01:06:17,406
(Kwang Soo and Seok Jin escape at the 38-minute mark.)

1915
01:06:19,364 --> 01:06:20,363
- Good job. - Let me see.

1916
01:06:20,364 --> 01:06:21,363
(They each receive 380 dollars.)

1917
01:06:21,364 --> 01:06:23,633
(He checks his final mission.)

1918
01:06:23,634 --> 01:06:24,684
Is it good?

1919
01:06:25,205 --> 01:06:27,800
What is this? Oh, come on.

1920
01:06:27,975 --> 01:06:29,258
Come on!

1921
01:06:30,044 --> 01:06:31,113
Oh, come on!

1922
01:06:31,114 --> 01:06:33,134
What is this?

1923
01:06:33,515 --> 01:06:34,726
What is this?

1924
01:06:35,515 --> 01:06:38,343
- How could you? - What is it?

1925
01:06:38,484 --> 01:06:40,030
Jong Kook should've seen me.

1926
01:06:40,384 --> 01:06:42,545
Why did it have to be Seok Jin?

1927
01:06:43,085 --> 01:06:45,014
Have I learned about him before?

1928
01:06:45,254 --> 01:06:46,253
Yes.

1929
01:06:46,254 --> 01:06:47,780
You know for sure.

1930
01:06:48,024 --> 01:06:49,277
How is that possible?

1931
01:06:49,725 --> 01:06:51,209
I rarely know things for sure.

1932
01:06:53,165 --> 01:06:56,863
(One more, and the runaways will be chosen.)

1933
01:06:56,864 --> 01:06:58,133
Does it include these words?

1934
01:06:58,134 --> 01:06:59,144
(He's unsure.)

1935
01:06:59,634 --> 01:07:00,856
Does it include these words?

1936
01:07:01,105 --> 01:07:02,388
It's "Yi Yuk" something.

1937
01:07:02,605 --> 01:07:04,244
- Hold on. What? - You have to be precise.

1938
01:07:04,245 --> 01:07:05,528
Be precise.

1939
01:07:05,774 --> 01:07:07,027
It's "Yi Yuk" something.

1940
01:07:08,044 --> 01:07:10,784
("Yi Yuk" is part of the answer?)

1941
01:07:10,785 --> 01:07:11,926
Isn't it similar? Wait.

1942
01:07:12,815 --> 01:07:15,349
Why can't I remember it?

1943
01:07:15,384 --> 01:07:17,054
I have no idea.

1944
01:07:17,055 --> 01:07:18,224
(She writes the answer.)

1945
01:07:18,225 --> 01:07:19,740
Room 3's answer...

1946
01:07:20,424 --> 01:07:21,677
to the 2nd question...

1947
01:07:21,725 --> 01:07:23,463
- is correct. - No way!

1948
01:07:23,464 --> 01:07:24,677
(Thanks to his hint, So Min gets it.)

1949
01:07:25,364 --> 01:07:29,607
(It's a twist of fate.)

1950
01:07:30,975 --> 01:07:33,503
(So Min escapes at the 33-minute mark.)

1951
01:07:33,504 --> 01:07:35,043
Haha doesn't know this one.

1952
01:07:35,044 --> 01:07:37,540
(She's sure he doesn't know.)

1953
01:07:38,174 --> 01:07:39,873
- Haha doesn't know. - What about me?

1954
01:07:39,874 --> 01:07:41,531
- What about me? - It's impossible.

1955
01:07:41,584 --> 01:07:43,654
- Do I not know as well? - There is absolutely...

1956
01:07:43,655 --> 01:07:44,953
no way you'd know.

1957
01:07:44,954 --> 01:07:46,283
(She gives him no hope.)

1958
01:07:46,284 --> 01:07:47,769
- Wasn't I right? - Yes.

1959
01:07:48,784 --> 01:07:49,923
It's similar, right?

1960
01:07:49,924 --> 01:07:51,623
(The 4 runaways are decided.)

1961
01:07:51,624 --> 01:07:53,311
- Wasn't my answer similar? - Yes.

1962
01:07:53,695 --> 01:07:54,907
- Right? - Jong Kook.

1963
01:07:55,225 --> 01:07:56,476
It's So Min.

1964
01:07:56,594 --> 01:07:58,080
- Gosh. It's So Min. - Oh, no.

1965
01:07:58,594 --> 01:07:59,908
- Goodness. - This is crazy.

1966
01:08:00,134 --> 01:08:01,133
So Min.

1967
01:08:01,134 --> 01:08:03,133
- Why did it have to be you? - Why?

1968
01:08:03,134 --> 01:08:04,215
Why?

1969
01:08:04,575 --> 01:08:05,615
Darn it.

1970
01:08:05,775 --> 01:08:08,169
- Why did you escape? - Why?

1971
01:08:08,244 --> 01:08:10,436
It's "Yi Yuk" something.

1972
01:08:10,544 --> 01:08:11,787
It's "Yi Yuk" something.

1973
01:08:11,914 --> 01:08:12,924
Yi Yuk Sa?

1974
01:08:13,544 --> 01:08:15,938
- Is that it? - I think so.

1975
01:08:16,384 --> 01:08:17,465
Is it Yi Yuk Sa?

1976
01:08:18,315 --> 01:08:20,423
Room 8's answer to the 2nd question is correct.

1977
01:08:20,424 --> 01:08:21,753
Let's go!

1978
01:08:21,754 --> 01:08:22,794
(Haha remembers the answer.)

1979
01:08:23,254 --> 01:08:25,524
(Thanks to Haha, )

1980
01:08:25,525 --> 01:08:28,252
(they all get out.)

1981
01:08:29,395 --> 01:08:31,434
(All right.)

1982
01:08:31,435 --> 01:08:34,633
(Shall we start the hunt?)

1983
01:08:34,634 --> 01:08:36,833
(Runaways, be afraid. Jong Kook is coming.)

1984
01:08:36,834 --> 01:08:38,854
He's out, he's out.

1985
01:08:39,134 --> 01:08:40,673
He's out. They're all coming out.

1986
01:08:40,674 --> 01:08:41,786
(Scared)

1987
01:08:42,674 --> 01:08:43,755
Where can I go?

1988
01:08:44,445 --> 01:08:45,644
There's no place to hide.

1989
01:08:45,645 --> 01:08:49,523
(They need to hold out and hide from the chasers.)

1990
01:08:50,584 --> 01:08:53,888
You weren't the first four to escape.

1991
01:08:54,185 --> 01:08:56,184
You have been assigned as chasers.

1992
01:08:56,185 --> 01:08:59,293
(The chasers need to catch the runaways.)

1993
01:08:59,294 --> 01:09:00,463
What?

1994
01:09:00,464 --> 01:09:02,788
Also, the money you had up until now...

1995
01:09:02,964 --> 01:09:04,105
has disappeared.

1996
01:09:04,464 --> 01:09:05,909
The 1st 4 who escaped...

1997
01:09:05,994 --> 01:09:07,216
are runaways.

1998
01:09:07,405 --> 01:09:08,748
As for them,

1999
01:09:08,805 --> 01:09:11,274
for every minute they stay hidden, they receive 10 dollars.

2000
01:09:11,275 --> 01:09:13,457
(The longer they hold out, the more they receive.)

2001
01:09:13,634 --> 01:09:15,703
Every time you rip a name tag,

2002
01:09:15,704 --> 01:09:17,796
you obtain that person's money.

2003
01:09:18,174 --> 01:09:21,684
The one with the most money wins at the end.

2004
01:09:21,685 --> 01:09:23,814
- Okay. So we rip name tags? - Correct.

2005
01:09:23,815 --> 01:09:25,268
I can rip 2 or 3 people?

2006
01:09:25,714 --> 01:09:27,484
Okay, let's go. This is better.

2007
01:09:27,485 --> 01:09:29,242
(The race begins.)

2008
01:09:29,924 --> 01:09:34,874
(Who will gain victory?)

2009
01:09:36,325 --> 01:09:38,314
If I were a runaway, where would I hide?

2010
01:09:38,935 --> 01:09:40,133
Where would I hide?

2011
01:09:40,134 --> 01:09:41,564
(The chasers can only win once they catch them all.)

2012
01:09:41,565 --> 01:09:43,434
Did you see anyone wearing the same outfit as me?

2013
01:09:43,435 --> 01:09:44,533
There's no one over there.

2014
01:09:44,534 --> 01:09:46,121
- Really? - Yes.

2015
01:09:46,275 --> 01:09:47,304
Thank you.

2016
01:09:47,305 --> 01:09:53,638
(The chasers spread out to find the runaways.)

2017
01:09:53,914 --> 01:09:55,227
I think they're at high places.

2018
01:09:56,485 --> 01:09:57,495
The parking lot?

2019
01:09:58,784 --> 01:10:02,157
(The chasers zero in on the runaways.)

2020
01:10:02,725 --> 01:10:06,293
(Meanwhile, Seok Jin is looking for a place to hide.)

2021
01:10:06,294 --> 01:10:07,423
(He searches for a place that's hard to find.)

2022
01:10:07,424 --> 01:10:08,793
There's no place to hide.

2023
01:10:08,794 --> 01:10:10,481
(He has gained 140 dollars so far.)

2024
01:10:11,094 --> 01:10:12,144
How about over there?

2025
01:10:12,695 --> 01:10:13,745
Come here.

2026
01:10:13,935 --> 01:10:15,833
(He finally finds an adequate place.)

2027
01:10:15,834 --> 01:10:17,474
Let's go. They won't find me here.

2028
01:10:17,475 --> 01:10:18,888
(He finally finds an adequate place.)

2029
01:10:19,475 --> 01:10:22,644
(He hides his frail body behind some branches.)

2030
01:10:22,645 --> 01:10:24,230
I'm sure they'll notice me.

2031
01:10:25,674 --> 01:10:26,774
Why did I have to wear yellow?

2032
01:10:26,775 --> 01:10:29,243
(Anyone can see this suspicious-looking yellowness.)

2033
01:10:29,244 --> 01:10:32,054
(Is he trying to disguise himself as a forsythia?)

2034
01:10:32,055 --> 01:10:35,123
(He strives to survive.)

2035
01:10:35,124 --> 01:10:37,316
Come over here. They won't spot us.

2036
01:10:37,695 --> 01:10:38,705
Right?

2037
01:10:38,754 --> 01:10:40,593
Good, but I think they'll spot you.

2038
01:10:40,594 --> 01:10:41,706
(We can see you.)

2039
01:10:42,225 --> 01:10:43,780
Can you just give me that and leave?

2040
01:10:44,195 --> 01:10:45,710
Give me that and leave, okay?

2041
01:10:45,895 --> 01:10:47,146
Give it to me and leave.

2042
01:10:48,365 --> 01:10:50,799
You both can leave. Go.

2043
01:10:51,004 --> 01:10:52,216
Go, and I'll do this myself.

2044
01:10:53,905 --> 01:10:55,965
I'm currently hidden in a very good spot.

2045
01:10:56,275 --> 01:10:57,343
(He successfully hides himself.)

2046
01:10:57,344 --> 01:10:58,673
I will win no matter what.

2047
01:10:58,674 --> 01:10:59,926
(He successfully hides himself.)

2048
01:11:00,784 --> 01:11:04,314
(Meanwhile, Jae Seok is at a parking lot.)

2049
01:11:04,315 --> 01:11:08,354
(Since he has the most money, he'll win if he holds out.)

2050
01:11:08,355 --> 01:11:12,324
(He decides to use their van as his hideout.)

2051
01:11:12,325 --> 01:11:13,911
Close the door!

2052
01:11:14,725 --> 01:11:16,613
I'm sorry. Hello.

2053
01:11:16,964 --> 01:11:19,394
Could you hide me in there, please?

2054
01:11:19,395 --> 01:11:21,503
(So Min has received 140 dollars so far.)

2055
01:11:21,504 --> 01:11:25,474
(She also decides to hide in a car.)

2056
01:11:26,874 --> 01:11:29,543
(Hurrying)

2057
01:11:29,544 --> 01:11:31,362
What should I do? Okay.

2058
01:11:31,615 --> 01:11:33,074
Hold it. Get in.

2059
01:11:33,075 --> 01:11:34,713
(Kwang Soo doesn't go far and also hides in a vehicle.)

2060
01:11:34,714 --> 01:11:36,360
Lock it.

2061
01:11:36,685 --> 01:11:39,513
(He uses his 9-year expertise and locks the door.)

2062
01:11:39,685 --> 01:11:44,402
(Except for Seok Jin, the rest hides in vehicles.)

2063
01:11:44,695 --> 01:11:46,024
I bet they're hiding in a car.

2064
01:11:46,025 --> 01:11:47,024
(He's experienced.)

2065
01:11:47,025 --> 01:11:49,293
(Haha also uses his 9-year experience as a runaway...)

2066
01:11:49,294 --> 01:11:51,991
(to guess where they could be hiding.)

2067
01:11:52,895 --> 01:11:55,592
Gosh! Hide! Goodness.

2068
01:11:56,735 --> 01:12:01,794
(Haha is near Jae Seok's car.)

2069
01:12:03,275 --> 01:12:07,689
(One turn of his head, and he will see him.)

2070
01:12:07,784 --> 01:12:11,753
(Afraid of getting caught, Jae Seok refuses to move.)

2071
01:12:12,015 --> 01:12:13,266
I bet they're in here.

2072
01:12:15,525 --> 01:12:21,180
(Haha is getting closer and closer.)

2073
01:12:23,365 --> 01:12:25,718
(At that moment, )

2074
01:12:27,305 --> 01:12:31,677
(he suddenly turns towards So Min.)

2075
01:12:32,775 --> 01:12:35,633
(He senses something suspicious about the car.)

2076
01:12:36,975 --> 01:12:38,428
Is anyone approaching this way?

2077
01:12:39,174 --> 01:12:40,286
If someone does come,

2078
01:12:40,914 --> 01:12:42,843
could you just drive?

2079
01:12:42,844 --> 01:12:44,083
(It's like her to say this.)

2080
01:12:44,084 --> 01:12:45,094
Okay.

2081
01:12:46,284 --> 01:12:50,324
(Haha approaches her car.)

2082
01:12:50,325 --> 01:12:52,577
My goodness. Tell them I'm not here.

2083
01:12:53,794 --> 01:12:57,531
(Suddenly, the door opens.)

2084
01:12:59,794 --> 01:13:00,904
Excuse me.

2085
01:13:00,905 --> 01:13:02,304
(He hasn't spotted her yet.)

2086
01:13:02,305 --> 01:13:03,304
So Min is...

2087
01:13:03,305 --> 01:13:04,487
here!

2088
01:13:04,775 --> 01:13:05,845
I knew it.

2089
01:13:06,105 --> 01:13:09,503
(He spots So Min who was hiding beneath the seat.)

2090
01:13:09,504 --> 01:13:11,574
- I knew you'd be here. - Why did you have to come?

2091
01:13:11,575 --> 01:13:12,656
I caught you.

2092
01:13:12,975 --> 01:13:14,500
Aren't you surprised?

2093
01:13:15,044 --> 01:13:16,213
So Min.

2094
01:13:16,214 --> 01:13:18,583
(So Min is eliminated.)

2095
01:13:18,584 --> 01:13:19,625
Aren't I just awesome?

2096
01:13:19,914 --> 01:13:21,184
That was great.

2097
01:13:21,185 --> 01:13:22,598
(Haha obtains her 200 dollars.)

2098
01:13:23,525 --> 01:13:24,753
I was the first one to get caught.

2099
01:13:24,754 --> 01:13:26,623
(Disappointed.)

2100
01:13:26,624 --> 01:13:27,806
This was a great spot, though.

2101
01:13:28,765 --> 01:13:30,663
(Looking around)

2102
01:13:30,664 --> 01:13:32,894
(Did Haha leave?)

2103
01:13:32,895 --> 01:13:34,279
At ease, at ease.

2104
01:13:34,704 --> 01:13:35,963
Haha was right there.

2105
01:13:35,964 --> 01:13:36,974
(He was lucky.)

2106
01:13:37,775 --> 01:13:42,243
(Meanwhile, Jong Kook looks inside the building.)

2107
01:13:42,244 --> 01:13:44,173
(Suddenly, he senses something...)

2108
01:13:44,174 --> 01:13:46,538
(like a professional and goes outside.)

2109
01:13:47,275 --> 01:13:49,314
(Did he spot the suspicious-looking yellowness?)

2110
01:13:49,315 --> 01:13:51,213
(Seok Jin is hiding right across the building.)

2111
01:13:51,214 --> 01:13:53,941
(Just pass me by, please.)

2112
01:13:55,284 --> 01:14:00,608
(He begins searching outdoors.)

2113
01:14:02,094 --> 01:14:04,894
(Will he get caught or not?)

2114
01:14:04,895 --> 01:14:06,133
They won't see me here.

2115
01:14:06,134 --> 01:14:08,791
(Will he get caught or not?)

2116
01:14:10,975 --> 01:14:15,116
(He spots a forsythia.)

2117
01:14:15,475 --> 01:14:17,667
(He has no idea that he's spotted.)

2118
01:14:18,174 --> 01:14:20,274
(He catches up to him before Seok Jin can even run.)

2119
01:14:20,275 --> 01:14:21,444
- Seok Jin. - How did you know?

2120
01:14:21,445 --> 01:14:23,484
I saw your yellow jacket.

2121
01:14:23,485 --> 01:14:25,677
(Seok Jin had a total of 290 dollars.)

2122
01:14:25,784 --> 01:14:27,027
- What? - Okay!

2123
01:14:27,155 --> 01:14:28,154
Okay.

2124
01:14:28,155 --> 01:14:29,295
- How did you know? - I got you.

2125
01:14:29,485 --> 01:14:30,566
Okay!

2126
01:14:31,395 --> 01:14:33,173
How could he see me?

2127
01:14:35,594 --> 01:14:38,533
(The remaining time is 7 minutes.)

2128
01:14:38,534 --> 01:14:41,503
(There are still 2 runaways remaining.)

2129
01:14:41,504 --> 01:14:42,764
Where could they be?

2130
01:14:42,765 --> 01:14:44,304
(If the runaways can hold out, it's their victory.)

2131
01:14:44,305 --> 01:14:46,325
I bet Kwang Soo is outside.

2132
01:14:46,775 --> 01:14:48,218
There's no way he's not.

2133
01:14:49,275 --> 01:14:50,285
Everyone.

2134
01:14:51,214 --> 01:14:52,614
I may be hiding here,

2135
01:14:52,615 --> 01:14:53,913
(Resolute)

2136
01:14:53,914 --> 01:14:55,803
but I doubt you'll see me on TV.

2137
01:14:57,315 --> 01:14:58,325
Everyone.

2138
01:14:59,284 --> 01:15:00,497
Please don't forget.

2139
01:15:01,454 --> 01:15:02,495
I am...

2140
01:15:03,454 --> 01:15:06,453
hiding in the back of a truck...

2141
01:15:06,454 --> 01:15:07,963
(He's confident they won't find him.)

2142
01:15:07,964 --> 01:15:09,307
that is parked near the entrance.

2143
01:15:10,294 --> 01:15:11,344
Everyone.

2144
01:15:12,235 --> 01:15:13,234
I'll see you next week.

2145
01:15:13,235 --> 01:15:14,564
(He says his goodbye.)

2146
01:15:14,565 --> 01:15:15,817
Check the truck!

2147
01:15:17,305 --> 01:15:18,790
Check the truck! Hurry!

2148
01:15:18,975 --> 01:15:20,116
- Look there. - Where? The truck?

2149
01:15:20,605 --> 01:15:22,173
(While Kwang Soo was chatting away, )

2150
01:15:22,174 --> 01:15:23,861
(the chasers have arrived at the parking lot.)

2151
01:15:24,174 --> 01:15:29,514
(As Jong Kook ordered, they search the truck.)

2152
01:15:29,515 --> 01:15:31,100
May I open this?

2153
01:15:31,185 --> 01:15:34,487
(I should've just stayed quiet.)

2154
01:15:35,485 --> 01:15:36,623
I'll open it.

2155
01:15:36,624 --> 01:15:37,793
(The chasers gather near him.)

2156
01:15:37,794 --> 01:15:39,440
- Can we open it? - Thank you.

2157
01:15:40,195 --> 01:15:44,533
(Haha and Ji Hyo open the truck.)

2158
01:15:44,534 --> 01:15:48,605
(Kwang Soo could get caught any minute now.)

2159
01:15:50,605 --> 01:15:52,774
(However, )

2160
01:15:52,775 --> 01:15:54,373
(Kwang Soo isn't inside.)

2161
01:15:54,374 --> 01:15:56,163
- What about those cabinets? - Let me check.

2162
01:15:56,475 --> 01:16:01,090
(Haha gets inside the truck to check.)

2163
01:16:03,485 --> 01:16:04,898
Hi, Kwang Soo.

2164
01:16:05,555 --> 01:16:08,614
Goodness, it must've been hard for you to stay in here.

2165
01:16:10,084 --> 01:16:12,793
(He catches Kwang Soo who has been hiding in the corner.)

2166
01:16:12,794 --> 01:16:14,623
- Kwang Soo. - Could I rip off his name tag?

2167
01:16:14,624 --> 01:16:16,079
Come here.

2168
01:16:16,525 --> 01:16:19,424
My, oh, my. You were in here.

2169
01:16:19,794 --> 01:16:21,381
- Get up. Well done. - How many minutes are left?

2170
01:16:21,964 --> 01:16:23,621
- How many minutes? - Well done.

2171
01:16:24,575 --> 01:16:25,774
(They successfully catch him.)

2172
01:16:25,775 --> 01:16:27,218
Goodness.

2173
01:16:27,844 --> 01:16:29,444
- Goodness. - How could think...

2174
01:16:29,445 --> 01:16:31,262
- about hiding in here? - We almost missed you.

2175
01:16:31,515 --> 01:16:33,373
This was amazing. We got him.

2176
01:16:33,374 --> 01:16:35,434
(How did you go in there?)

2177
01:16:35,945 --> 01:16:39,046
Viewers, thank you for supporting me.

2178
01:16:39,454 --> 01:16:42,110
I will give the camera back to the staff.

2179
01:16:42,655 --> 01:16:43,896
Viewers, bye.

2180
01:16:44,855 --> 01:16:47,093
Is Kwang Soo out? Gosh, this is driving me crazy.

2181
01:16:47,094 --> 01:16:48,663
(Jae Seok is the only runaway left.)

2182
01:16:48,664 --> 01:16:49,923
My goodness.

2183
01:16:49,924 --> 01:16:51,694
I could get caught any minute...

2184
01:16:51,695 --> 01:16:53,093
since they are combing through the place.

2185
01:16:53,094 --> 01:16:55,225
There is no place to hide.

2186
01:16:55,265 --> 01:16:57,021
We just need to find Jae Seok.

2187
01:16:58,905 --> 01:17:02,107
He could be inside a car. Open each car.

2188
01:17:03,275 --> 01:17:07,444
(Jae Seok can't run away because of the chasers.)

2189
01:17:07,445 --> 01:17:10,783
(Chasers search thoroughly with only a few minutes remaining.)

2190
01:17:10,784 --> 01:17:11,953
Hello.

2191
01:17:11,954 --> 01:17:14,449
He isn't in the car, is he?

2192
01:17:14,825 --> 01:17:16,137
I am sorry.

2193
01:17:19,025 --> 01:17:21,564
(At that moment, )

2194
01:17:21,565 --> 01:17:25,433
(Ji Hyo heads to the vehicle Jae Seok is hiding.)

2195
01:17:26,464 --> 01:17:27,493
(If Jae Seok gets taken out, the runaways will lose.)

2196
01:17:27,494 --> 01:17:28,904
She is here. She is in front of the van.

2197
01:17:28,905 --> 01:17:30,348
(If Jae Seok gets taken out, the runaways will lose.)

2198
01:17:30,834 --> 01:17:35,622
(What will become of Jae Seok in the van?)

2199
01:17:36,075 --> 01:17:38,569
I found Jae Seok! He is here!

2200
01:17:39,315 --> 01:17:40,728
Lock the door. Lock the door!

2201
01:17:41,485 --> 01:17:46,130
(Chasers gather around instantly.)

2202
01:17:47,084 --> 01:17:48,873
Lock the door. Lock the door!

2203
01:17:49,424 --> 01:17:51,071
Lock the door. Lock the door!

2204
01:17:51,294 --> 01:17:52,506
Lock the door.

2205
01:17:52,754 --> 01:17:53,793
Come on.

2206
01:17:53,794 --> 01:17:57,229
(If he holds out for 30 seconds, he will win.)

2207
01:17:58,435 --> 01:17:59,963
(At that moment, )

2208
01:17:59,964 --> 01:18:02,328
(Kim Jong Kook appears.)

2209
01:18:02,664 --> 01:18:05,836
(He opened the trunk like an expert.)

2210
01:18:06,674 --> 01:18:08,998
(He corners Jae Seok right away.)

2211
01:18:09,575 --> 01:18:11,014
(Jae Seok escaped with 57 minutes remaining.)

2212
01:18:11,015 --> 01:18:12,731
(If he holds out, he will save up 570 dollars.)

2213
01:18:13,414 --> 01:18:14,514
I ripped it off.

2214
01:18:14,515 --> 01:18:15,684
(The last runaway, Jae Seok is out.)

2215
01:18:15,685 --> 01:18:18,514
(570 dollars get transferred to Jong Kook.)

2216
01:18:18,515 --> 01:18:21,786
(With 10 seconds remaining, all 4 runaways get taken out.)

2217
01:18:23,525 --> 01:18:24,838
The final winner...

2218
01:18:25,195 --> 01:18:27,175
- of The Great War of Money is... - Who is it?

2219
01:18:27,525 --> 01:18:29,064
- Kim Jong Kook. - Is it me?

2220
01:18:29,065 --> 01:18:30,093
What?

2221
01:18:30,094 --> 01:18:31,478
(The final winner is Kim Jong Kook.)

2222
01:18:32,034 --> 01:18:33,333
(He won 860 dollars by taking out Seok Jin and Jae Seok.)

2223
01:18:33,334 --> 01:18:35,485
- I am sick and tired of it. - My goodness.

2224
01:18:35,905 --> 01:18:37,722
- There is no point in trying hard. - I am sick and tired of it.

2225
01:18:38,075 --> 01:18:40,373
- Seriously. - Jong Kook always wins.

2226
01:18:40,374 --> 01:18:41,373
(Jong Kook always wins.)

2227
01:18:41,374 --> 01:18:44,444
We gave you questions earlier, right?

2228
01:18:44,544 --> 01:18:47,746
Combine those questions and open the safe in front of you.

2229
01:18:49,445 --> 01:18:52,054
(To open the safe which contains the prize, )

2230
01:18:52,055 --> 01:18:55,257
(they must combine the answers of the 100 Minute House.)

2231
01:18:56,185 --> 01:18:58,724
(The 1st answer was Subway Line 6.)

2232
01:18:58,725 --> 01:19:00,423
(The 2nd answer was Yi Yuk Sa.)

2233
01:19:00,424 --> 01:19:03,224
(The combined number is 6264.)

2234
01:19:03,225 --> 01:19:04,305
6264.

2235
01:19:04,865 --> 01:19:06,106
- 6264. - 6264.

2236
01:19:08,405 --> 01:19:11,003
(What does the number 6264 mean?)

2237
01:19:11,004 --> 01:19:12,014
Did it open?

2238
01:19:13,435 --> 01:19:14,455
Turn it.

2239
01:19:14,744 --> 01:19:15,804
What's inside?

2240
01:19:15,805 --> 01:19:17,795
(What's inside the safe?)

2241
01:19:18,344 --> 01:19:19,843
- There is something inside. - What is it?

2242
01:19:19,844 --> 01:19:21,213
- It's a book. - A book?

2243
01:19:21,214 --> 01:19:22,843
(There is a book inside the safe.)

2244
01:19:22,844 --> 01:19:25,913
(What is this extraordinary book?)

2245
01:19:25,914 --> 01:19:27,413
They said the prize is impressive.

2246
01:19:27,414 --> 01:19:28,783
- What? - Is it related to dawn club?

2247
01:19:28,784 --> 01:19:29,835
What is this?

2248
01:19:30,124 --> 01:19:32,377
- What? - Is it related to dawn club?

2249
01:19:33,055 --> 01:19:34,054
(My goodness.)

2250
01:19:34,055 --> 01:19:35,064
What is it?

2251
01:19:35,065 --> 01:19:37,194
(What is it?)

2252
01:19:37,195 --> 01:19:40,434
The race of the day commemorates the 100th anniversary...

2253
01:19:40,435 --> 01:19:42,434
- of the March 1st Movement. - I see.

2254
01:19:42,435 --> 01:19:44,474
(100th Anniversary Special of the March 1st Movement, )

2255
01:19:44,475 --> 01:19:46,353
(The Great War of Money)

2256
01:19:46,735 --> 01:19:50,144
March 1st of 2019 marks the 100th anniversary...

2257
01:19:50,145 --> 01:19:54,386
of the March 1st Movement, which showed Korean resistance...

2258
01:19:54,414 --> 01:19:56,213
- during the Japanese rule. - It's the 100th anniversary.

2259
01:19:56,214 --> 01:19:57,644
(It's an event which shaped Korea the way it is now.)

2260
01:19:57,645 --> 01:19:59,913
For the first mission, you shouted hurray with people,

2261
01:19:59,914 --> 01:20:01,324
jumped ropes 19 times,

2262
01:20:01,325 --> 01:20:02,799
and aimed to get a score of 100...

2263
01:20:03,084 --> 01:20:04,923
since the March 1st Movement of 1919...

2264
01:20:04,924 --> 01:20:06,844
was an achievement of the common people...

2265
01:20:06,954 --> 01:20:10,093
who transcended classes, gender, and generations.

2266
01:20:10,094 --> 01:20:12,821
(It was an achievement of the common people.)

2267
01:20:13,164 --> 01:20:14,404
- Thank you. - Here you go.

2268
01:20:14,405 --> 01:20:16,033
(To commemorate the March 1st Movement, )

2269
01:20:16,034 --> 01:20:17,564
(souvenirs were given to people who participated in the missions.)

2270
01:20:17,565 --> 01:20:20,160
- My goodness. - There is everything.

2271
01:20:21,044 --> 01:20:24,203
(Do you remember?)

2272
01:20:24,204 --> 01:20:26,243
(You racked your brain...)

2273
01:20:26,244 --> 01:20:29,214
(to decipher a code.)

2274
01:20:29,544 --> 01:20:30,843
(Korean code)

2275
01:20:30,844 --> 01:20:33,783
(It was a mission which utilized the actual code...)

2276
01:20:33,784 --> 01:20:36,083
(of the Korean independence activists.)

2277
01:20:36,084 --> 01:20:38,194
At the location of the second mission,

2278
01:20:38,195 --> 01:20:40,750
we included the story of an independence activist...

2279
01:20:40,994 --> 01:20:45,611
who was seen as a libertine all his life, Kim Yong Hwan.

2280
01:20:45,865 --> 01:20:48,259
He was 1 of the top 3 libertines of Joseon Dynasty.

2281
01:20:48,435 --> 01:20:50,833
He gambled every day and lost his ancestral house...

2282
01:20:50,834 --> 01:20:52,421
and his land about 600,000 square meters.

2283
01:20:52,475 --> 01:20:54,191
That's about 20 million dollars' worth.

2284
01:20:55,445 --> 01:20:56,703
He received much criticism...

2285
01:20:56,704 --> 01:20:59,843
because he lost all the fortune and even gambled away the money...

2286
01:20:59,844 --> 01:21:01,532
for his daughter's wedding.

2287
01:21:01,914 --> 01:21:03,965
With that kind of money, he gambled until dawn.

2288
01:21:04,115 --> 01:21:06,942
When he couldn't win money, he yelled "dawn club!"

2289
01:21:06,954 --> 01:21:08,453
Dawn club!

2290
01:21:08,454 --> 01:21:09,623
(This is how he did it.)

2291
01:21:09,624 --> 01:21:11,654
He called over subordinates who were holding clubs...

2292
01:21:11,655 --> 01:21:13,194
to steal all the money.

2293
01:21:13,195 --> 01:21:15,387
He delivered the money he gathered with much criticism...

2294
01:21:15,494 --> 01:21:19,293
to activists for the independence movement.

2295
01:21:19,294 --> 01:21:22,093
However, he kept it a secret until the day he died.

2296
01:21:22,235 --> 01:21:24,833
He had to keep up the pretense...

2297
01:21:24,834 --> 01:21:26,404
so that he wouldn't get caught.

2298
01:21:26,405 --> 01:21:27,904
(He sacrificed his honor for the independence movement.)

2299
01:21:27,905 --> 01:21:30,501
This page reads, "Do you know who these people are?"

2300
01:21:32,975 --> 01:21:34,713
(Do you know who these people are?)

2301
01:21:34,714 --> 01:21:37,139
The combined answers gave you the number, 6264.

2302
01:21:37,515 --> 01:21:39,505
On 1989, 45 years after the liberation,

2303
01:21:39,615 --> 01:21:42,524
something was found in the dusty cabinet...

2304
01:21:42,525 --> 01:21:44,948
of what is now the National Police Agency.

2305
01:21:45,294 --> 01:21:47,194
It was 6,264 cards for people...

2306
01:21:47,195 --> 01:21:49,245
who were under surveillance during the Japanese rule.

2307
01:21:50,124 --> 01:21:51,564
(I see.)

2308
01:21:51,565 --> 01:21:54,093
In those 6,264 cards were...

2309
01:21:54,094 --> 01:21:55,864
people of all ages who were restaurant owners, students,

2310
01:21:55,865 --> 01:21:58,097
farmers, reporters, nurses, etc.

2311
01:21:58,374 --> 01:22:01,474
There were common citizens as well as independence activists...

2312
01:22:01,475 --> 01:22:03,019
we all know such as Yu Gwan Sun,

2313
01:22:03,275 --> 01:22:05,213
Han Yong Un, Yun Bog Gil, Ahn Chang Ho,

2314
01:22:05,214 --> 01:22:06,274
Kim Won-bong, and others.

2315
01:22:06,275 --> 01:22:09,274
Besides the ones whose information was found 45 years later,

2316
01:22:09,445 --> 01:22:12,083
there must have been many independence activists.

2317
01:22:12,084 --> 01:22:13,701
We lived our lives without knowing who they are.

2318
01:22:13,855 --> 01:22:17,592
6264 is a symbol of the history that was made by people...

2319
01:22:17,725 --> 01:22:19,054
who wished for the nation's independence...

2320
01:22:19,055 --> 01:22:23,812
and a trace of nameless activists we must remember.

2321
01:22:25,294 --> 01:22:28,703
(The place the members are at, Hyochang Park, )

2322
01:22:28,704 --> 01:22:31,865
(holds the grave of Kim Gu and shrine of An Jung Geun.)

2323
01:22:32,805 --> 01:22:34,474
(On the upcoming March 1st, )

2324
01:22:34,475 --> 01:22:37,172
(remember those who made the country the way it is...)

2325
01:22:37,374 --> 01:22:40,944
(and the day we must not forget.)

2326
01:22:40,945 --> 01:22:44,014
Even besides the ones we know,

2327
01:22:44,015 --> 01:22:46,338
there have been many patriotic martyrs...

2328
01:22:46,454 --> 01:22:48,783
who gave up their lives...

2329
01:22:48,784 --> 01:22:51,324
for the independence of Korea.

2330
01:22:51,325 --> 01:22:53,324
We use this opportunity to thank them wholeheartedly.

2331
01:22:53,325 --> 01:22:55,394
- Thank you. - Thank you so much.

2332
01:22:55,395 --> 01:22:57,593
(We will remember your shout. Thank you.)

2333
01:22:57,594 --> 01:22:58,878
I didn't know it was that bad.

2334
01:22:58,915 --> 01:23:02,955
(A mysterious video appears before the Running Man members.)

2335
01:23:03,584 --> 01:23:05,284
(I am your judge, )

2336
01:23:05,285 --> 01:23:06,583
(The Bee.)

2337
01:23:06,584 --> 01:23:09,393
(The appearance of a cute judge makes the members laugh.)

2338
01:23:09,394 --> 01:23:11,763
(The first member to be judged is...)

2339
01:23:11,764 --> 01:23:14,048
(Kim Jong Kook.)

2340
01:23:14,594 --> 01:23:15,878
(When the Bee says their names, the members disappear.)

2341
01:23:16,264 --> 01:23:18,184
Anyone would think you are the Bee.

2342
01:23:18,235 --> 01:23:19,263
Is the Bee among us?

2343
01:23:19,264 --> 01:23:21,534
(Is someone behind everything?)

2344
01:23:21,535 --> 01:23:24,131
(Schemes and twists surrounding the mysterious Bee.)

2345
01:23:24,844 --> 01:23:27,329
(What's the shocking identity of the Bee?)

2346
01:23:27,844 --> 01:23:30,702
(The Revenge of the Bee)
