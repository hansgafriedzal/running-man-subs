1
00:00:05,772 --> 00:00:07,185
(Last week)

2
00:00:07,872 --> 00:00:12,759
(It was a battle of singles with Hee Jin, Bona, and Jae Young.)

3
00:00:12,971 --> 00:00:17,551
(2 of them are a secret couple, and 1 of them is a relationship virgin.)

4
00:00:17,552 --> 00:00:21,120
(Find the secret couple! Thus began the war of suspicion.)

5
00:00:21,121 --> 00:00:24,829
(Ji Hyo and Jae Young became likely candidates for the secret couple.)

6
00:00:25,252 --> 00:00:27,690
(And Hee Jin was another strong candidate.)

7
00:00:27,691 --> 00:00:31,161
(She didn't share the hint she received with the others.)

8
00:00:31,162 --> 00:00:34,431
(Which 2 members are the secret couple?)

9
00:00:34,432 --> 00:00:36,770
(And another hint was at stake on Three-Way Tug-of-War.)

10
00:00:36,771 --> 00:00:37,800
(Team Hello Honey,)

11
00:00:37,801 --> 00:00:38,800
(Team Comedians,)

12
00:00:38,801 --> 00:00:40,791
(and Team Youth finished scouting college members.)

13
00:00:41,571 --> 00:00:43,771
Come on, this isn't fair.

14
00:00:43,772 --> 00:00:45,671
What is that? Hold on.

15
00:00:45,672 --> 00:00:47,904
Jong Kook is unbelievable.

16
00:00:49,441 --> 00:00:51,680
- They walk differently. Look. - Is he serious?

17
00:00:51,681 --> 00:00:53,851
Why does everyone on his team walk like Jong Kook does?

18
00:00:53,852 --> 00:00:56,580
(They are Jong Kook's lookalikes. They walk confidently.)

19
00:00:56,581 --> 00:00:57,991
Isn't that too much?

20
00:00:57,992 --> 00:00:59,304
Will this even be fair for us?

21
00:00:59,751 --> 00:01:01,681
Are you here to fight us or what?

22
00:01:02,162 --> 00:01:03,290
(We'll tell you about this team.)

23
00:01:03,291 --> 00:01:04,431
(He stood out as soon as I walked in.)

24
00:01:04,432 --> 00:01:06,061
(At his first glance, he picked a model and a big guy.)

25
00:01:06,062 --> 00:01:08,460
(After the soda mission, he finishes scouting the guy.)

26
00:01:08,461 --> 00:01:09,460
(How tall are you?)

27
00:01:09,461 --> 00:01:10,871
(My height is 191cm.)

28
00:01:10,872 --> 00:01:12,330
(He even finished scouting...)

29
00:01:12,331 --> 00:01:14,089
(this handsome, tall guy with a flexible back.)

30
00:01:14,441 --> 00:01:15,600
He's so tall.

31
00:01:15,601 --> 00:01:17,270
- We got the military science major. - Are you serious?

32
00:01:17,271 --> 00:01:18,270
We chose the modeling major.

33
00:01:18,271 --> 00:01:20,981
- We had the modeling major. - Listen.

34
00:01:20,982 --> 00:01:23,880
(Jong Kook is commanding the elite, Big Build 11.)

35
00:01:24,051 --> 00:01:26,550
We lost. We lost.

36
00:01:26,551 --> 00:01:28,821
But your team looks too strong.

37
00:01:28,822 --> 00:01:31,250
Right now, someone from the military science major...

38
00:01:31,251 --> 00:01:32,891
ripped his pants.

39
00:01:32,892 --> 00:01:34,690
- What? - His pants got ripped now.

40
00:01:34,691 --> 00:01:36,220
- Why is that? - What?

41
00:01:36,221 --> 00:01:37,660
- Why did he rip his pants? - We were playing a game.

42
00:01:37,661 --> 00:01:38,803
I see.

43
00:01:39,532 --> 00:01:43,160
(He twisted his feet with sharp moves.)

44
00:01:43,161 --> 00:01:45,731
(Wait, time-out. His pants...)

45
00:01:45,732 --> 00:01:48,970
(As he was exploding with energy, his pants exploded too.)

46
00:01:48,971 --> 00:01:52,710
(They did their best with the gags on.)

47
00:01:52,711 --> 00:01:55,380
(The team finished scouting the Playful Gag Trio too.)

48
00:01:55,381 --> 00:01:57,331
(She feels reassured about her team.)

49
00:01:57,611 --> 00:02:00,050
His pants got ripped all the way here.

50
00:02:00,051 --> 00:02:01,350
(They look strict, but clumsy.)

51
00:02:01,351 --> 00:02:03,614
(They are the real clumsy men.)

52
00:02:03,721 --> 00:02:05,421
My gosh, our team is clustered together.

53
00:02:05,422 --> 00:02:06,937
Our team looks so adorable.

54
00:02:06,961 --> 00:02:08,161
It's like we're herbivores.

55
00:02:08,162 --> 00:02:09,261
(This herbivore-looking team is...)

56
00:02:09,262 --> 00:02:10,372
We're so cute.

57
00:02:10,431 --> 00:02:11,674
We're cute.

58
00:02:12,031 --> 00:02:14,761
(In this vast campus like the meadow of Africa,)

59
00:02:14,762 --> 00:02:17,601
(they finished scouting Freddie Dog, an unexpected fighter.)

60
00:02:17,602 --> 00:02:19,622
(And...)

61
00:02:20,341 --> 00:02:23,503
(They also scouted the giraffe and llama who do everything to win.)

62
00:02:24,012 --> 00:02:27,541
(People are getting along in Campus Africa today as always.)

63
00:02:27,542 --> 00:02:29,936
(We're like herbivores.)

64
00:02:30,982 --> 00:02:34,487
(The Animal Kingdom of the Herbivores)

65
00:02:34,722 --> 00:02:37,321
Kwang Soo, you're one person short. Is that number seven?

66
00:02:37,322 --> 00:02:38,751
- Yes. - He's not here yet.

67
00:02:38,752 --> 00:02:40,960
- I don't know what that is though. - He went back for the attendance.

68
00:02:40,961 --> 00:02:42,960
- It was for the attendance. - It was for the attendance.

69
00:02:42,961 --> 00:02:44,960
- He got the place wrong too. - Three.

70
00:02:44,961 --> 00:02:46,261
- There's nothing we can do. - Really?

71
00:02:46,262 --> 00:02:47,261
- 2. - 2.

72
00:02:47,262 --> 00:02:49,120
(Sounding firm)

73
00:02:49,232 --> 00:02:51,001
- Why do you sound so cold? - Come on.

74
00:02:51,002 --> 00:02:52,001
(It's because this doesn't concern you.)

75
00:02:52,002 --> 00:02:53,571
(Seok Jin is a cold fighter when it comes to games.)

76
00:02:53,572 --> 00:02:55,101
You sounded too cold.

77
00:02:55,102 --> 00:02:59,617
Someone has a blind date at 6pm today.

78
00:02:59,711 --> 00:03:00,792
Where is she? Who is it?

79
00:03:00,882 --> 00:03:01,911
- She has the blind date. - Right.

80
00:03:01,912 --> 00:03:03,381
- It's at 6pm. - She dressed up nicely too.

81
00:03:03,382 --> 00:03:04,851
She has to look nice for that.

82
00:03:04,852 --> 00:03:06,050
She skipped her class to be here.

83
00:03:06,051 --> 00:03:07,421
- We don't have much time. - I'm so nervous.

84
00:03:07,422 --> 00:03:08,780
We must hurry, so she makes it in time.

85
00:03:08,781 --> 00:03:10,451
If you have a blind date, you can go early.

86
00:03:10,452 --> 00:03:11,836
- No, no. - It's a group blind date.

87
00:03:11,892 --> 00:03:14,060
Everyone, the rules are simple.

88
00:03:14,061 --> 00:03:17,631
Each team will start tugging the rope at the sound of a whistle.

89
00:03:17,632 --> 00:03:19,460
The team that rings the bell...

90
00:03:19,461 --> 00:03:21,654
at the end of the rope wins the game.

91
00:03:21,961 --> 00:03:25,071
Everyone, stand and hold your rope.

92
00:03:25,072 --> 00:03:26,631
- Let's go! - Let's go!

93
00:03:26,632 --> 00:03:28,171
- Let's go! - Let's go!

94
00:03:28,172 --> 00:03:29,340
- I'll be at the end. - No.

95
00:03:29,341 --> 00:03:31,370
- Should we line up here? - Do what you want to do.

96
00:03:31,371 --> 00:03:33,370
- Jae Seok. - This way?

97
00:03:33,371 --> 00:03:35,580
- Strong people must be in front. - Strong people go to the front.

98
00:03:35,581 --> 00:03:37,080
- Or other teams can easily pull us. - In the front...

99
00:03:37,081 --> 00:03:39,780
When he blows the whistle, lean back and start tugging.

100
00:03:39,781 --> 00:03:41,772
We have to go that way. Alternate from the sides.

101
00:03:41,952 --> 00:03:43,590
- Should we pull at short intervals? - Should we?

102
00:03:43,591 --> 00:03:46,650
- Yo-heave-ho, Yo-heave-ho. - Short intervals? Yo-heave-ho.

103
00:03:46,651 --> 00:03:47,821
(They aim to win with the chant.)

104
00:03:47,822 --> 00:03:49,060
Do you have a slogan?

105
00:03:49,061 --> 00:03:51,586
- We can do, "1, 2. 1, 2." - 1, 2. 1, 2.

106
00:03:52,591 --> 00:03:55,001
- I won first place in the army. - Really?

107
00:03:55,002 --> 00:03:56,360
The gaps were consistent.

108
00:03:56,361 --> 00:03:57,701
We used our arms to measure the gap.

109
00:03:57,702 --> 00:03:59,631
- That's great. Show us how. - That's so interesting.

110
00:03:59,632 --> 00:04:01,171
- Extend your arm. - A shoulder apart.

111
00:04:01,172 --> 00:04:03,091
We have to alternate the sides first.

112
00:04:03,611 --> 00:04:04,810
We won first place with this method.

113
00:04:04,811 --> 00:04:06,071
- Okay. - Okay.

114
00:04:06,072 --> 00:04:07,658
- You should stand over there. - Here?

115
00:04:08,012 --> 00:04:10,951
We'll do the chant, "Yo-heave-ho, Yo-heave-ho".

116
00:04:10,952 --> 00:04:14,617
When we start the game, you'll end up rushing it anyway.

117
00:04:14,822 --> 00:04:16,871
Stronger ones will be in the front.

118
00:04:16,952 --> 00:04:19,451
It's better for the smaller ones to be in the back.

119
00:04:19,452 --> 00:04:21,520
We can mix it up. Four of you should come here.

120
00:04:21,521 --> 00:04:22,720
How are we supposed to defeat them?

121
00:04:22,721 --> 00:04:24,960
- Those guys... - Jong Kook is instructing them too.

122
00:04:24,961 --> 00:04:25,960
(This is so scary.)

123
00:04:25,961 --> 00:04:28,457
Hey, that number seven from the modeling major.

124
00:04:28,661 --> 00:04:30,176
I bet he's famous at this school.

125
00:04:30,971 --> 00:04:32,100
I think he was a swimmer too.

126
00:04:32,101 --> 00:04:33,170
All right. Are you ready?

127
00:04:33,171 --> 00:04:34,371
- Yes! - Do a good job.

128
00:04:34,372 --> 00:04:36,270
- We can do this! - Yes!

129
00:04:36,271 --> 00:04:38,071
- Let's go! - Let's do this!

130
00:04:38,072 --> 00:04:39,840
- We can do this! - We can do this!

131
00:04:39,841 --> 00:04:41,441
Let's go for it!

132
00:04:41,442 --> 00:04:43,431
- Let's go! - Let's go!

133
00:04:43,851 --> 00:04:45,225
My throat hurts.

134
00:04:45,312 --> 00:04:46,611
(Kwang Soo with long arms and legs is the tail for Team Youth.)

135
00:04:46,612 --> 00:04:48,821
(The tail of Team Hello Honey is...)

136
00:04:48,822 --> 00:04:49,821
(Jae Young, another tall guy.)

137
00:04:49,822 --> 00:04:51,871
- Let's do this! - We'll start now.

138
00:04:51,992 --> 00:04:53,133
Get ready!

139
00:04:53,252 --> 00:04:54,777
Set.

140
00:04:56,262 --> 00:04:59,464
(The Three-Way Tug-of-War starts.)

141
00:05:00,562 --> 00:05:03,663
(Team Comedians is in perfect order with their chant.)

142
00:05:04,171 --> 00:05:07,670
(Team Youth is evenly spreading out the strength.)

143
00:05:07,671 --> 00:05:10,297
(Team Hello Honey believes in Jong Kook's command.)

144
00:05:11,041 --> 00:05:13,741
(It's a close game.)

145
00:05:13,742 --> 00:05:14,840
- Yo-heave-ho, Yo-heave-ho. - Yo-heave-ho, Yo-heave-ho.

146
00:05:14,841 --> 00:05:16,540
(However, at that moment...)

147
00:05:16,541 --> 00:05:18,633
(Chanting)

148
00:05:19,112 --> 00:05:21,751
Pull! Pull!

149
00:05:21,752 --> 00:05:22,751
(Exerting superhuman power)

150
00:05:22,752 --> 00:05:23,850
- Yo-heave-ho. - Yo-heave-ho.

151
00:05:23,851 --> 00:05:26,391
(It's moving to Jong Kook's team.)

152
00:05:26,392 --> 00:05:27,491
- No! - Yo-heave-ho.

153
00:05:27,492 --> 00:05:29,481
(Jae Young is approaching the bell too.)

154
00:05:30,392 --> 00:05:33,633
(Team Hello Honey is getting closer to the bell.)

155
00:05:34,502 --> 00:05:36,701
(Will they win as soon as it starts?)

156
00:05:36,702 --> 00:05:38,044
- Everyone, do it together. - Start.

157
00:05:38,271 --> 00:05:39,770
(Will Jong Kook's elite group win just as expected?)

158
00:05:39,771 --> 00:05:41,014
- Hang in there! - Yo-heave-ho.

159
00:05:41,471 --> 00:05:42,552
Yo-heave-ho.

160
00:05:42,642 --> 00:05:45,036
(We can't lose like this!)

161
00:05:45,471 --> 00:05:48,472
(Kwang Soo has a lonely fight with the bell.)

162
00:05:48,512 --> 00:05:50,976
- Yo-heave-ho. - Just a little more! A little more!

163
00:05:51,752 --> 00:05:55,216
(I want to create a miracle of the bell with my fingertips.)

164
00:05:55,952 --> 00:06:00,761
(Please help me create the miracle with my unlucky hands.)

165
00:06:00,762 --> 00:06:03,261
(Do not give up until the end.)

166
00:06:03,262 --> 00:06:06,530
(He focuses on the rope instead of the bell for now.)

167
00:06:06,531 --> 00:06:07,714
(Exerting force)

168
00:06:08,762 --> 00:06:10,216
(Exerting force)

169
00:06:11,031 --> 00:06:13,001
(With Kwang Soo's scream,)

170
00:06:13,002 --> 00:06:15,466
(the rope is heading toward him.)

171
00:06:16,541 --> 00:06:18,793
(He pulled it!)

172
00:06:20,642 --> 00:06:21,753
- To the back! - A little more!

173
00:06:22,281 --> 00:06:23,393
No!

174
00:06:23,612 --> 00:06:25,400
Pull! My gosh!

175
00:06:25,612 --> 00:06:27,035
My gosh. Hey, hey.

176
00:06:27,851 --> 00:06:30,790
(It's a miracle of herbivores, up against Jong Kook's elite group.)

177
00:06:30,791 --> 00:06:34,155
(The giraffe, the captain of herbivores, sets out.)

178
00:06:34,562 --> 00:06:38,631
(Go! Show people how strong we, herbivores, can be!)

179
00:06:38,632 --> 00:06:42,701
(A story of the giraffe who defeated the tiger will be remembered.)

180
00:06:42,702 --> 00:06:44,520
A little more! A little more!

181
00:06:44,901 --> 00:06:46,001
Please!

182
00:06:46,002 --> 00:06:47,820
(He's only a few inches away from the bell.)

183
00:06:50,242 --> 00:06:52,433
(He's literally right in front of it!)

184
00:06:53,242 --> 00:06:54,780
- No! - Yo-heave-ho!

185
00:06:54,781 --> 00:06:57,710
(Jong Kook's elite legion is being dragged against their will.)

186
00:06:57,711 --> 00:07:00,520
(They are so close that they can almost taste their victory.)

187
00:07:00,521 --> 00:07:01,650
(No!)

188
00:07:01,651 --> 00:07:02,792
No! Pull!

189
00:07:03,081 --> 00:07:06,520
(This is it! Pull it now!)

190
00:07:06,521 --> 00:07:09,761
(I just need to extend my arm...)

191
00:07:09,762 --> 00:07:12,631
(to reach the bell!)

192
00:07:12,632 --> 00:07:14,521
(Missing the rope)

193
00:07:15,101 --> 00:07:17,121
- No! - Just a little more!

194
00:07:17,872 --> 00:07:19,730
(He missed the rope that was right in front of him.)

195
00:07:19,731 --> 00:07:21,600
Please! Please!

196
00:07:21,601 --> 00:07:23,001
(That was a great opportunity. Gosh, what a shame.)

197
00:07:23,002 --> 00:07:24,556
Kwang Soo... Pull!

198
00:07:24,942 --> 00:07:26,124
Pull!

199
00:07:26,372 --> 00:07:30,011
(My warriors,)

200
00:07:30,012 --> 00:07:33,821
(get up.)

201
00:07:33,822 --> 00:07:36,621
(As Jong Kook leads them,)

202
00:07:36,622 --> 00:07:39,991
(the soldiers of his elite legion start moving in perfect teamwork.)

203
00:07:39,992 --> 00:07:42,012
- No! Please! - Let's go!

204
00:07:42,291 --> 00:07:43,391
- Please! - We can do it!

205
00:07:43,392 --> 00:07:44,431
(Wavering)

206
00:07:44,432 --> 00:07:45,573
- Hang in there. - Come on.

207
00:07:46,161 --> 00:07:48,230
(We'll lose if we don't do anything.)

208
00:07:48,231 --> 00:07:49,501
Come on! Pull!

209
00:07:49,502 --> 00:07:51,391
(We won't go easy on you now. We'll make sure we win this game.)

210
00:07:52,132 --> 00:07:54,301
(And at this moment,)

211
00:07:54,302 --> 00:07:58,381
(Jae Young extends his arm to the bell.)

212
00:07:59,242 --> 00:08:00,780
- Pull! - No way!

213
00:08:00,781 --> 00:08:03,267
(They are so close to winning the game.)

214
00:08:03,312 --> 00:08:06,611
(No!)

215
00:08:06,612 --> 00:08:09,920
(The moment he rings the bell, they'll win, and the game is over.)

216
00:08:09,921 --> 00:08:10,991
Hang in there!

217
00:08:10,992 --> 00:08:14,891
(What's the result?)

218
00:08:14,892 --> 00:08:17,820
(Ringing)

219
00:08:18,862 --> 00:08:21,160
(Team Hello Honey wins.)

220
00:08:21,161 --> 00:08:22,374
- You did great. - Good job.

221
00:08:22,562 --> 00:08:23,814
- Hey. - Great job.

222
00:08:25,531 --> 00:08:26,582
No, no, no.

223
00:08:26,671 --> 00:08:27,955
- That was so hard. - It was so hard.

224
00:08:28,101 --> 00:08:29,900
- We didn't have enough people. - We weren't even close.

225
00:08:29,901 --> 00:08:31,270
(The bitterness of losing to Jong Kook feels familiar.)

226
00:08:31,271 --> 00:08:32,422
Good work.

227
00:08:33,112 --> 00:08:34,481
(Whistling)

228
00:08:34,482 --> 00:08:36,611
(Flinging)

229
00:08:36,612 --> 00:08:37,723
It's always annoying.

230
00:08:38,352 --> 00:08:39,493
I'm serious.

231
00:08:39,911 --> 00:08:41,062
We never win a single match!

232
00:08:41,252 --> 00:08:43,280
We went all the way to the bell in the beginning.

233
00:08:43,281 --> 00:08:45,675
- We were so close, weren't we? - Yes, it was so close.

234
00:08:45,752 --> 00:08:47,509
That was no joke.

235
00:08:47,561 --> 00:08:49,060
- Congratulations. The victory... - Thank you.

236
00:08:49,061 --> 00:08:50,435
goes to Jong Kook's team.

237
00:08:50,791 --> 00:08:51,974
Yes!

238
00:08:52,232 --> 00:08:54,252
- Thank you for your help! - Well done.

239
00:08:54,262 --> 00:08:55,861
Our team worked so hard for us.

240
00:08:55,862 --> 00:08:58,631
By the way, if we hadn't had these five guys with us,

241
00:08:58,632 --> 00:08:59,800
- it would've been over right away. - Right, right.

242
00:08:59,801 --> 00:09:01,200
- These five guys were great. - They were so good.

243
00:09:01,201 --> 00:09:03,394
- They helped us stay... - We pulled to their chant.

244
00:09:03,771 --> 00:09:05,489
- They worked so hard. - Their chanting...

245
00:09:05,742 --> 00:09:07,933
Their chant was so great.

246
00:09:07,982 --> 00:09:09,324
They got more energy...

247
00:09:09,382 --> 00:09:10,998
out of our chant.

248
00:09:11,681 --> 00:09:14,221
(With the military science major's loud chant,)

249
00:09:14,222 --> 00:09:17,483
(Jong Kook's elite legion received more energy.)

250
00:09:17,722 --> 00:09:20,247
But their teamwork was great. They are indeed soldiers.

251
00:09:20,762 --> 00:09:23,591
We'll bid farewell to the students...

252
00:09:23,592 --> 00:09:25,261
- who worked so hard for us. - Thank you.

253
00:09:25,262 --> 00:09:26,891
- Thank you. - Thank you.

254
00:09:26,892 --> 00:09:28,300
- Thank you. - Thank you so much.

255
00:09:28,301 --> 00:09:30,220
- Thank you for your help. - Thank you.

256
00:09:30,262 --> 00:09:32,353
- Thank you. - Thank you, everyone.

257
00:09:32,502 --> 00:09:34,360
- Your pants were ripped. I'm sorry. - It's okay.

258
00:09:34,372 --> 00:09:36,300
- Thank you for your help. - Thank you.

259
00:09:36,301 --> 00:09:38,432
(We will root for your bright youth.)

260
00:09:38,541 --> 00:09:40,329
This isn't what's important now.

261
00:09:41,012 --> 00:09:43,211
We have to figure out who the secret couple is.

262
00:09:43,212 --> 00:09:45,550
- He's right. - I completely forgot about it.

263
00:09:45,551 --> 00:09:47,239
This isn't the main game.

264
00:09:47,252 --> 00:09:49,806
- I totally forgot. - We have to figure out who it is.

265
00:09:49,852 --> 00:09:51,266
- Everyone. - Yes.

266
00:09:51,321 --> 00:09:54,660
I said the secret couple must do a hidden mission for every round.

267
00:09:54,661 --> 00:09:55,721
- Yes. - Did they succeed?

268
00:09:55,722 --> 00:09:58,831
I informed you, if they failed, I will share a hint with everyone.

269
00:09:58,832 --> 00:10:00,131
- Yes. - They must have failed.

270
00:10:00,132 --> 00:10:01,231
They failed.

271
00:10:01,232 --> 00:10:03,971
(The secret couple failed the hidden mission.)

272
00:10:03,972 --> 00:10:05,070
(They acquire a hint about the secret couple.)

273
00:10:05,071 --> 00:10:06,687
- This is amazing. - Move back.

274
00:10:07,102 --> 00:10:08,841
(What on earth was the mission?)

275
00:10:08,842 --> 00:10:10,993
- Which member failed? - Why did you fail?

276
00:10:11,041 --> 00:10:12,385
I told you it's not me.

277
00:10:13,142 --> 00:10:14,981
(Their suspicion is directed at Ji Hyo, the prime suspect.)

278
00:10:14,982 --> 00:10:17,103
- Or could it be... - It's not that!

279
00:10:17,352 --> 00:10:18,751
Was their mission losing the game?

280
00:10:18,752 --> 00:10:20,851
- So Ji Hyo had no choice. - She had to lose, but won.

281
00:10:20,852 --> 00:10:21,950
- No. - Really?

282
00:10:21,951 --> 00:10:24,221
(Was the hidden mission losing the Three-Way Tug-of-War?)

283
00:10:24,222 --> 00:10:26,891
- You'll know once you get the hint. - Okay.

284
00:10:26,892 --> 00:10:28,073
(Is Ji Hyo a secret couple?)

285
00:10:28,592 --> 00:10:30,761
(Right before the tug-of-war...)

286
00:10:30,762 --> 00:10:32,044
- Jae Young, you must do it. - Yes.

287
00:10:33,232 --> 00:10:36,331
(She and Jae Young had a mysterious conversation.)

288
00:10:36,332 --> 00:10:39,937
(Did she not look happy after winning it because of the mission?)

289
00:10:40,872 --> 00:10:42,641
(Are they truly the secret couple?)

290
00:10:42,642 --> 00:10:43,940
- Okay. - Wait.

291
00:10:43,941 --> 00:10:45,111
- When she was playing it... - Is that so?

292
00:10:45,112 --> 00:10:46,270
I felt this earlier.

293
00:10:46,271 --> 00:10:47,940
Kwang Soo couldn't reach the bell when he could have.

294
00:10:47,941 --> 00:10:49,611
(Kwang Soo is a strong candidate too.)

295
00:10:49,612 --> 00:10:50,763
Something is definitely off.

296
00:10:50,911 --> 00:10:51,981
(It's suspicious how he lost it when it was so close.)

297
00:10:51,982 --> 00:10:53,598
Something is definitely happening.

298
00:10:54,151 --> 00:10:55,969
When I was pulling, I saw Kwang Soo.

299
00:10:56,021 --> 00:10:58,820
- He could have reached it. - Did you not ring it on purpose?

300
00:10:58,821 --> 00:11:00,437
- No, I really couldn't reach. - He was so close.

301
00:11:00,722 --> 00:11:02,438
I tried with my arms and feet.

302
00:11:04,031 --> 00:11:06,991
(He was literally right in front of it.)

303
00:11:06,992 --> 00:11:09,231
(It's very suspicious how he just missed it.)

304
00:11:09,232 --> 00:11:12,601
(Is Kwang Soo really the secret couple?)

305
00:11:12,602 --> 00:11:14,700
- No, no. It doesn't make sense. - You're it.

306
00:11:14,701 --> 00:11:15,913
Did you not ring it on purpose?

307
00:11:16,171 --> 00:11:17,928
- Really? You didn't on purpose? - I tried with my arms and feet.

308
00:11:18,142 --> 00:11:21,211
I have a hunch. He could've rung it. Something is up.

309
00:11:21,781 --> 00:11:23,600
- Who could it be? - Okay.

310
00:11:23,781 --> 00:11:25,195
- Give us the hint. - The secret couple must've won.

311
00:11:25,551 --> 00:11:26,780
Give us the hint first.

312
00:11:26,781 --> 00:11:28,981
- The guy... - Okay.

313
00:11:28,982 --> 00:11:29,981
(The hint about the secret couple is revealed.)

314
00:11:29,982 --> 00:11:31,507
- The guy of the secret couple... - The guy.

315
00:11:32,191 --> 00:11:35,352
uses his real name in the entertainment industry.

316
00:11:35,762 --> 00:11:36,873
Lee Kwang Soo.

317
00:11:37,962 --> 00:11:39,144
- Lee Kwang Soo. - Wait.

318
00:11:39,392 --> 00:11:41,149
Everyone uses their real name!

319
00:11:41,332 --> 00:11:43,078
- Me. - Who else?

320
00:11:43,232 --> 00:11:44,685
It's everyone except for Haha.

321
00:11:44,801 --> 00:11:46,084
We know for sure that Haha isn't.

322
00:11:46,102 --> 00:11:47,971
- Jae Young uses his real name. - Se Chan uses his real name.

323
00:11:47,972 --> 00:11:49,170
- Everyone uses their real name. - It's everyone except for Haha.

324
00:11:49,171 --> 00:11:50,971
- It's everyone except for Haha. - We know it's not Haha.

325
00:11:50,972 --> 00:11:52,425
It's not me. I told you it wasn't me.

326
00:11:52,472 --> 00:11:53,824
If you're a relationship virgin, come to me.

327
00:11:54,142 --> 00:11:56,111
- That's right. Haha is the safest. - Come talk to me in secret.

328
00:11:56,112 --> 00:11:57,323
- That's right. - Yes.

329
00:11:57,411 --> 00:11:58,694
He's right.

330
00:11:59,551 --> 00:12:02,076
1 of the 3 winning members must receive the hint.

331
00:12:02,781 --> 00:12:04,751
Why don't you share the hint when you get it?

332
00:12:04,752 --> 00:12:05,950
Please share it with us.

333
00:12:05,951 --> 00:12:07,335
Yes, you must share it with us.

334
00:12:07,592 --> 00:12:09,160
- We must catch the couple. - Everyone.

335
00:12:09,161 --> 00:12:11,491
- Shouldn't I get the hint? - I'll get the hint.

336
00:12:11,492 --> 00:12:12,761
- I agree with you. - I agree.

337
00:12:12,762 --> 00:12:14,461
- Me too. - That's fair.

338
00:12:14,462 --> 00:12:16,131
- See? I should. - I'm really not the couple.

339
00:12:16,132 --> 00:12:17,800
Just to be safe, I'll take a look.

340
00:12:17,801 --> 00:12:19,231
I can share it with you.

341
00:12:19,232 --> 00:12:20,670
There's no need for you to get it.

342
00:12:20,671 --> 00:12:21,971
- You'll really share it with me? - Of course.

343
00:12:21,972 --> 00:12:23,284
Then just share it with the three of us.

344
00:12:23,441 --> 00:12:24,926
No, I'll share it with everyone.

345
00:12:25,411 --> 00:12:27,881
- It's really not me. - I'll take a look to be safe.

346
00:12:27,882 --> 00:12:29,599
- Jong Kook... - I'll share the hint.

347
00:12:29,882 --> 00:12:31,650
- I can share it with you all. - Talk to him.

348
00:12:31,651 --> 00:12:33,011
- Jae Young, talk to him. - Jae Young.

349
00:12:33,012 --> 00:12:34,851
(It's okay.)

350
00:12:34,852 --> 00:12:36,251
- I can share it with you. - You should get the hint.

351
00:12:36,252 --> 00:12:38,443
(Acting scared)

352
00:12:38,691 --> 00:12:40,136
- I will share it too. - I'll take a look.

353
00:12:40,291 --> 00:12:43,060
- Jae Young is smart. - He knows how to read the room.

354
00:12:43,061 --> 00:12:44,631
- Hurry. - All right. Here's the order.

355
00:12:44,632 --> 00:12:46,753
I'll read it first. The three of us will read it.

356
00:12:46,832 --> 00:12:48,246
- Then we'll decide to share or not. - Okay.

357
00:12:48,701 --> 00:12:50,278
- We'll do that. - Okay.

358
00:12:50,332 --> 00:12:51,400
- That's good, right? - Wait.

359
00:12:51,401 --> 00:12:52,501
- Before that... - Jong Kook said he'll share.

360
00:12:52,502 --> 00:12:53,900
(He can pick a hint about the couple or the relationship virgin.)

361
00:12:53,901 --> 00:12:55,540
(Which hint did Jong Kook choose?)

362
00:12:55,541 --> 00:12:56,855
Let me take a look first.

363
00:12:58,271 --> 00:12:59,453
My gosh.

364
00:13:00,311 --> 00:13:01,452
What is it?

365
00:13:01,612 --> 00:13:03,680
- Let's share. - Why don't we share it?

366
00:13:03,681 --> 00:13:05,481
(He said, "My gosh" as soon as he read it.)

367
00:13:05,482 --> 00:13:07,550
It said, "The guy is taller than 175cm."

368
00:13:07,551 --> 00:13:10,251
(The guy of the secret couple is taller than 175cm.)

369
00:13:10,252 --> 00:13:11,621
You guys raised the number.

370
00:13:11,622 --> 00:13:14,622
(Again, it only excludes Haha as he's shorter than 175cm.)

371
00:13:15,321 --> 00:13:17,615
Hey, how tall is Haha?

372
00:13:17,732 --> 00:13:19,731
- 175cm? - Se Chan isn't it either.

373
00:13:19,732 --> 00:13:21,216
- You're shorter than 175cm? - You're not it.

374
00:13:22,431 --> 00:13:23,775
Hold this. This is insulting.

375
00:13:23,931 --> 00:13:25,930
- Hey, you're shorter than that. - This is insulting.

376
00:13:25,931 --> 00:13:27,900
- He's so short. - You're not that tall?

377
00:13:27,901 --> 00:13:29,101
- Stand up straight. - You're shorter than that?

378
00:13:29,102 --> 00:13:30,313
I thought you were taller than that.

379
00:13:30,372 --> 00:13:31,670
- This is insulting. - Isn't that you?

380
00:13:31,671 --> 00:13:33,126
This is really insulting.

381
00:13:33,171 --> 00:13:35,081
- Se Chan isn't it either. - That's true.

382
00:13:35,082 --> 00:13:37,410
Did you set it to 175cm for Se Chan?

383
00:13:37,411 --> 00:13:39,168
(Even in the Shorty Club, there's a gap too.)

384
00:13:40,181 --> 00:13:41,680
We know for sure that these two aren't the couple.

385
00:13:41,681 --> 00:13:42,751
We've excluded two members now.

386
00:13:42,752 --> 00:13:44,351
(2 of the candidates for the secret couple are excluded.)

387
00:13:44,352 --> 00:13:45,891
My gosh, this is driving me crazy.

388
00:13:45,892 --> 00:13:48,649
I think Haha's height was 170-something.

389
00:13:49,061 --> 00:13:51,091
Now, you only have the final mission.

390
00:13:51,092 --> 00:13:53,454
- This is the final mission? - As for the final mission,

391
00:13:54,332 --> 00:13:55,501
- we'll do it indoors. - Okay.

392
00:13:55,502 --> 00:13:56,915
- Yes! - Let's do that.

393
00:13:57,571 --> 00:13:58,871
Relationship virgin, come to me.

394
00:13:58,872 --> 00:14:00,114
(Will the singles be able to catch the secret couple?)

395
00:14:01,441 --> 00:14:03,724
All right. You're no longer with your teams.

396
00:14:03,842 --> 00:14:05,226
- We don't have teams now, right? - Is that so?

397
00:14:05,441 --> 00:14:08,240
The last mission to catch the secret couple is...

398
00:14:08,311 --> 00:14:10,641
Shining Singles' Trial.

399
00:14:10,642 --> 00:14:13,050
(The last mission, Shining Singles' Trial)

400
00:14:13,051 --> 00:14:14,697
- A trial? - Singles' Trial.

401
00:14:14,752 --> 00:14:16,700
It's like the song.

402
00:14:17,892 --> 00:14:19,520
(How will we do the trial?)

403
00:14:19,521 --> 00:14:22,660
Hints about the secret couple and the relationship virgin...

404
00:14:22,661 --> 00:14:24,761
are hidden all over the building.

405
00:14:24,762 --> 00:14:26,361
There are hints here.

406
00:14:26,362 --> 00:14:31,018
Find the hints. Every 30 minutes, 2 trials will be held.

407
00:14:31,102 --> 00:14:33,030
During those trials, you will decide on which members to eliminate.

408
00:14:33,031 --> 00:14:35,070
My gosh, two trials. That's nice.

409
00:14:35,071 --> 00:14:36,871
If the selected members are indeed the secret couple,

410
00:14:36,872 --> 00:14:39,266
the relationship virgin and the singles will win.

411
00:14:39,642 --> 00:14:42,106
However, if the relationship virgin is eliminated,

412
00:14:42,142 --> 00:14:43,780
or if you fail to catch...

413
00:14:43,781 --> 00:14:46,135
the secret couple even after two trials,

414
00:14:46,212 --> 00:14:47,767
the secret couple will win.

415
00:14:47,982 --> 00:14:50,608
The prize will go to the secret couple.

416
00:14:51,151 --> 00:14:52,263
No, no.

417
00:14:52,321 --> 00:14:53,790
- Let's stop them. - We must.

418
00:14:53,791 --> 00:14:54,920
We should catch them.

419
00:14:54,921 --> 00:14:56,020
We must protect...

420
00:14:56,021 --> 00:14:57,133
- the relationship virgin. - That's right.

421
00:14:57,222 --> 00:14:59,591
If you're the relationship virgin, go to Haha or Se Chan.

422
00:14:59,592 --> 00:15:01,147
- We'll protect you! - Let's protect that person.

423
00:15:01,232 --> 00:15:02,646
Relationship virgin, go to them now.

424
00:15:03,002 --> 00:15:04,971
That's right. We'll protect you.

425
00:15:04,972 --> 00:15:07,331
(Can the singles protect the relationship virgin...)

426
00:15:07,332 --> 00:15:10,029
(and catch the secret couple?)

427
00:15:10,171 --> 00:15:11,241
This is hard.

428
00:15:11,242 --> 00:15:12,626
I don't think Se Chan,

429
00:15:13,012 --> 00:15:14,841
Jae Seok, and Seok Jin...

430
00:15:14,842 --> 00:15:16,962
are not the secret couple including myself, of course.

431
00:15:17,612 --> 00:15:19,268
So far, we haven't won any hints...

432
00:15:19,281 --> 00:15:21,504
that tell us which members are the secret couple.

433
00:15:21,681 --> 00:15:25,025
But I don't know what hint Hee Jin received.

434
00:15:26,421 --> 00:15:29,461
(Last week, at the restaurant,)

435
00:15:29,462 --> 00:15:32,997
(Hee Jin won a hint.)

436
00:15:33,691 --> 00:15:36,831
(Because she didn't share the hint, she was easily suspected...)

437
00:15:36,832 --> 00:15:40,407
(as one of the secret couple.)

438
00:15:41,171 --> 00:15:44,131
It's either Kwang Soo and Hee Jin or Ji Hyo and Jae Young.

439
00:15:46,142 --> 00:15:47,555
This morning,

440
00:15:48,941 --> 00:15:51,310
I caught Hee Jin and Kwang Soo exchanging looks...

441
00:15:51,311 --> 00:15:54,009
when we were receiving our clothes.

442
00:15:54,382 --> 00:15:56,520
I even remember the clothes they were handing out.

443
00:15:56,521 --> 00:15:58,020
(He's been suspecting them.)

444
00:15:58,021 --> 00:15:59,667
Secret couple...

445
00:16:00,352 --> 00:16:01,621
Jang Hee Jin.

446
00:16:01,622 --> 00:16:03,410
(So Min also suspects Hee Jin.)

447
00:16:04,092 --> 00:16:06,920
It's either Hee Jin and Kwang Soo or...

448
00:16:07,392 --> 00:16:08,560
I think it's Jae Young...

449
00:16:08,561 --> 00:16:09,601
(Hee Jin and Kwang Soo, or Jae Young and Ji Hyo)

450
00:16:09,602 --> 00:16:10,743
and Ji Hyo.

451
00:16:11,531 --> 00:16:13,971
(These 4 are the most-suspected candidates.)

452
00:16:13,972 --> 00:16:16,871
(Is the secret couple among them?)

453
00:16:17,571 --> 00:16:19,259
The race starts now.

454
00:16:19,571 --> 00:16:21,259
Let's go.

455
00:16:23,082 --> 00:16:25,511
We just need to find the couple to finish our mission for today.

456
00:16:25,512 --> 00:16:26,550
(They need to eliminate the secret couple.)

457
00:16:26,551 --> 00:16:28,975
Once we catch them, the single members win.

458
00:16:31,921 --> 00:16:34,386
(At that moment...)

459
00:16:34,862 --> 00:16:35,973
Look at them.

460
00:16:37,122 --> 00:16:38,160
Look at them.

461
00:16:38,161 --> 00:16:39,560
(So Min and Jae Young...)

462
00:16:39,561 --> 00:16:43,066
(come out from the same room.)

463
00:16:44,872 --> 00:16:46,285
You guys were together.

464
00:16:47,171 --> 00:16:48,741
No, we weren't.

465
00:16:48,742 --> 00:16:50,893
- What? - He came out from there.

466
00:16:51,112 --> 00:16:52,841
How many floors is this building?

467
00:16:52,842 --> 00:16:54,962
(Jae Young followed So Min out.)

468
00:16:55,041 --> 00:16:56,310
- What's wrong? - Nothing.

469
00:16:56,311 --> 00:16:57,452
- What is it? - Okay.

470
00:16:58,612 --> 00:16:59,924
All right.

471
00:17:00,882 --> 00:17:02,840
You're really suspicious-looking at the moment.

472
00:17:02,951 --> 00:17:04,851
People are suspecting you for whispering...

473
00:17:04,852 --> 00:17:07,114
- to Hee Jin. - Whispering?

474
00:17:07,151 --> 00:17:09,111
You're the most-suspected, okay?

475
00:17:09,191 --> 00:17:10,460
(At that moment,)

476
00:17:10,461 --> 00:17:13,218
(they find a hint hidden inside the vending machine.)

477
00:17:13,961 --> 00:17:17,294
(That hint is mine!)

478
00:17:18,102 --> 00:17:21,641
(So Min acquires it first.)

479
00:17:21,642 --> 00:17:22,641
No.

480
00:17:22,642 --> 00:17:24,710
What are you doing?

481
00:17:24,711 --> 00:17:26,641
Stop it. What are you doing?

482
00:17:26,642 --> 00:17:28,311
Stop it!

483
00:17:28,312 --> 00:17:29,510
- Hey! - What are they doing?

484
00:17:29,511 --> 00:17:30,611
What are you doing?

485
00:17:30,612 --> 00:17:32,227
- It's Kwang Soo. - Kwang Soo!

486
00:17:32,282 --> 00:17:33,650
- Kwang Soo! - It's mine!

487
00:17:33,651 --> 00:17:34,950
- He found one already? - Don't do that.

488
00:17:34,951 --> 00:17:36,063
It's mine.

489
00:17:36,651 --> 00:17:38,720
(After stealing the hint, the culprit runs away.)

490
00:17:38,721 --> 00:17:39,791
It's mine.

491
00:17:39,792 --> 00:17:43,255
(Catch that suspicious-looking man!)

492
00:17:43,522 --> 00:17:46,160
(What is he up to this time?)

493
00:17:46,161 --> 00:17:48,531
- He's so mean. - What happened?

494
00:17:48,532 --> 00:17:50,730
It was mine. He's so suspicious.

495
00:17:50,731 --> 00:17:53,226
He wanted my hint so badly.

496
00:17:53,272 --> 00:17:54,940
We could share it.

497
00:17:54,941 --> 00:17:56,316
(After stealing it, he runs away.)

498
00:17:57,572 --> 00:17:59,240
(He gets cornered and is forced to share the hint.)

499
00:17:59,241 --> 00:18:00,323
What is it?

500
00:18:01,112 --> 00:18:02,222
What is it?

501
00:18:02,282 --> 00:18:04,028
- Come here. - Let's share.

502
00:18:04,411 --> 00:18:06,604
"The female of the secret couple is in her 30s."

503
00:18:08,981 --> 00:18:11,321
(The female of the secret couple is in her 30s.)

504
00:18:11,322 --> 00:18:14,392
(Song Ji Hyo, Jang Hee Jin, Jeon So Min)

505
00:18:15,261 --> 00:18:18,361
(Bona, who is in her 20s, is ruled out.)

506
00:18:18,362 --> 00:18:19,591
Bona is out of the picture.

507
00:18:19,592 --> 00:18:20,930
(Then the remaining women are...)

508
00:18:20,931 --> 00:18:23,400
- It's not Bona. - Haha.

509
00:18:23,401 --> 00:18:24,631
(Hee Jin, Ji Hyo, and So Min.)

510
00:18:24,632 --> 00:18:26,170
- Kwang Soo... - What's wrong with you?

511
00:18:26,171 --> 00:18:27,900
- did a good job. - Why?

512
00:18:27,901 --> 00:18:29,700
- I got a huge hint. - Let me see.

513
00:18:29,701 --> 00:18:31,510
- It was mine. - I ripped it.

514
00:18:31,511 --> 00:18:32,571
- Let me see. - Why did you do that...

515
00:18:32,572 --> 00:18:34,041
when I found it?

516
00:18:34,042 --> 00:18:35,710
- You were in it. - It's her.

517
00:18:35,711 --> 00:18:37,381
- I was in it? - What was the hint?

518
00:18:37,382 --> 00:18:38,450
I'll let you know in private.

519
00:18:38,451 --> 00:18:40,881
If I'm part of it, let me know.

520
00:18:40,882 --> 00:18:43,021
- It says your name. - Fine, don't tell me, then.

521
00:18:43,022 --> 00:18:44,021
Are you sulking?

522
00:18:44,022 --> 00:18:45,690
(Sulky)

523
00:18:45,691 --> 00:18:47,190
- I'll let you know. - Forget it.

524
00:18:47,191 --> 00:18:48,361
(He's flustered.)

525
00:18:48,362 --> 00:18:49,690
- I'll tell you. - Forget it.

526
00:18:49,691 --> 00:18:50,891
- No, I'll tell you. - Let me go.

527
00:18:50,892 --> 00:18:52,430
Why would you get sulky...

528
00:18:52,431 --> 00:18:53,730
- I'll tell you. - while shooting?

529
00:18:53,731 --> 00:18:55,923
- Come on. - The culprit is...

530
00:18:56,532 --> 00:18:57,831
a beauty.

531
00:18:57,832 --> 00:19:00,970
(The culprit is a beauty.)

532
00:19:00,971 --> 00:19:02,170
It's me.

533
00:19:02,171 --> 00:19:04,667
(I'm the beauty.)

534
00:19:04,812 --> 00:19:06,571
That's why I couldn't tell you.

535
00:19:06,572 --> 00:19:08,381
- It's me. - I can't tell you.

536
00:19:08,382 --> 00:19:10,099
- You look happy now. - I'm the culprit.

537
00:19:10,312 --> 00:19:12,735
I'm the beauty the hint mentioned.

538
00:19:12,951 --> 00:19:15,305
- Really? - Gosh, I pity you.

539
00:19:16,681 --> 00:19:18,950
- How could you say that? - Your name was written on it.

540
00:19:18,951 --> 00:19:20,739
- It was? All right. - Yes.

541
00:19:21,592 --> 00:19:25,167
(Bona is looking for the hints alone.)

542
00:19:25,832 --> 00:19:27,750
(Where could they be?)

543
00:19:28,761 --> 00:19:32,065
(She finds one.)

544
00:19:33,201 --> 00:19:34,230
Is this it?

545
00:19:34,231 --> 00:19:36,828
(What will this hint say?)

546
00:19:37,142 --> 00:19:38,341
(The relationship virgin uses their real name.)

547
00:19:38,342 --> 00:19:39,827
(Excluded: Haha, Song Ji Hyo, Bona)

548
00:19:41,072 --> 00:19:43,607
(Those three individuals are exempted.)

549
00:19:43,711 --> 00:19:45,266
- My goodness. - You startled me.

550
00:19:45,951 --> 00:19:48,581
(Hee Jin, a strong candidate, appears.)

551
00:19:48,582 --> 00:19:50,521
What is it? I guess you found a hint.

552
00:19:50,522 --> 00:19:53,650
(What is it? I guess you found a hint.)

553
00:19:53,651 --> 00:19:54,861
Did you find anything?

554
00:19:54,862 --> 00:19:56,477
Should we exchange information?

555
00:19:56,761 --> 00:19:57,891
What is it?

556
00:19:57,892 --> 00:20:00,061
Let's be friends.

557
00:20:00,062 --> 00:20:03,160
We're both single members, so let's exchange information.

558
00:20:03,161 --> 00:20:04,230
Bona.

559
00:20:04,231 --> 00:20:05,730
(Suddenly)

560
00:20:05,731 --> 00:20:07,170
- Bona. - My goodness.

561
00:20:07,171 --> 00:20:08,240
(Another strong candidate appears.)

562
00:20:08,241 --> 00:20:10,565
- Kwang Soo. - Did you find anything?

563
00:20:10,941 --> 00:20:13,063
- Kwang Soo, listen. - Bona, you're off the leash.

564
00:20:13,112 --> 00:20:14,597
- How? - How about me?

565
00:20:14,642 --> 00:20:15,722
- Let me go first. - How did you know?

566
00:20:15,882 --> 00:20:18,111
I'm sorry to say this, but I've found a hint.

567
00:20:18,112 --> 00:20:19,799
- What is it? - What did it say?

568
00:20:19,852 --> 00:20:21,521
Let's share. I have a hint too.

569
00:20:21,522 --> 00:20:22,851
- Me too. - You do?

570
00:20:22,852 --> 00:20:24,420
Yes, we all have one.

571
00:20:24,421 --> 00:20:26,091
- Let's exchange hints. - Yes.

572
00:20:26,092 --> 00:20:29,220
(They all agree to share their hints.)

573
00:20:29,221 --> 00:20:30,621
- I memorized mine. - What?

574
00:20:30,622 --> 00:20:31,874
So did I.

575
00:20:33,632 --> 00:20:35,076
"The female suspect..."

576
00:20:35,602 --> 00:20:37,147
"has dyed her hair."

577
00:20:40,001 --> 00:20:41,516
But I dyed my hair.

578
00:20:42,201 --> 00:20:43,601
I dyed my hair too.

579
00:20:43,602 --> 00:20:44,854
What's yours?

580
00:20:45,171 --> 00:20:47,271
- You're lying, aren't you? - I bet he is.

581
00:20:47,272 --> 00:20:48,341
- Then... - You don't have a hint, do you?

582
00:20:48,342 --> 00:20:50,341
- I didn't write it. - You don't have one, right?

583
00:20:50,342 --> 00:20:52,611
- No, I do. I'll show you. - Be honest.

584
00:20:52,612 --> 00:20:54,210
Actually, I have more than one.

585
00:20:54,211 --> 00:20:56,321
I got one in the beginning, and I found one here too.

586
00:20:56,322 --> 00:20:57,990
- Right, you got one at the start. - Yes.

587
00:20:57,991 --> 00:20:59,621
- That's a good one. - I'll show you mine.

588
00:20:59,622 --> 00:21:01,410
- Here. - Let me see.

589
00:21:01,862 --> 00:21:03,912
"The female of the secret couple is in her 30s."

590
00:21:03,921 --> 00:21:05,779
- So Bona's not a suspect. - No way!

591
00:21:07,632 --> 00:21:09,960
- No way. - Hold on.

592
00:21:09,961 --> 00:21:11,920
- Come here. Did you find a hint? - Aren't I right?

593
00:21:12,231 --> 00:21:13,400
Did you?

594
00:21:13,401 --> 00:21:14,940
Let's share, now that I know you're not one.

595
00:21:14,941 --> 00:21:17,601
(Haha and Bona are confirmed single members.)

596
00:21:17,602 --> 00:21:18,940
Bona, let's share.

597
00:21:18,941 --> 00:21:20,071
- Wait a minute. - Come here.

598
00:21:20,072 --> 00:21:21,240
- Step away. - Haha.

599
00:21:21,241 --> 00:21:22,581
(They're naturally divided up.)

600
00:21:22,582 --> 00:21:23,910
It's not me.

601
00:21:23,911 --> 00:21:25,351
- Don't come. - I shared with you!

602
00:21:25,352 --> 00:21:27,051
- Go lie down over there! - Fine!

603
00:21:27,052 --> 00:21:29,121
- Sit down over there. - You shouldn't trust Kwang Soo,

604
00:21:29,122 --> 00:21:30,121
- all right? - What do you mean?

605
00:21:30,122 --> 00:21:31,250
You're one of the suspects.

606
00:21:31,251 --> 00:21:33,351
Yes, Hee Jin's a suspect too, so come here.

607
00:21:33,352 --> 00:21:35,482
Bona, it's not me.

608
00:21:36,062 --> 00:21:38,430
- Let's go first. - That's a good idea.

609
00:21:38,431 --> 00:21:40,583
You're just going to leave after hearing my hint?

610
00:21:41,261 --> 00:21:43,331
(You can't just leave like this.)

611
00:21:43,332 --> 00:21:44,831
- What? - Are you just leaving?

612
00:21:44,832 --> 00:21:45,930
Be on alert at all times.

613
00:21:45,931 --> 00:21:47,700
Hold on. Let me explain.

614
00:21:47,701 --> 00:21:49,240
- Wait. - Hee Jin, who is it?

615
00:21:49,241 --> 00:21:50,716
- What? - Who's your partner?

616
00:21:51,001 --> 00:21:52,470
(He tries to corner her.)

617
00:21:52,471 --> 00:21:53,856
- Who's your partner? - It's not me.

618
00:21:54,142 --> 00:21:55,541
- It's not me. - Tell us.

619
00:21:55,542 --> 00:21:56,710
- Kwang Soo. - Who's the guy?

620
00:21:56,711 --> 00:21:58,311
- Hear me out. - Bona, let's run.

621
00:21:58,312 --> 00:21:59,393
Come here.

622
00:21:59,681 --> 00:22:01,781
Haha, it's not me!

623
00:22:01,782 --> 00:22:03,051
- Wait! - Look at you!

624
00:22:03,052 --> 00:22:05,950
(While pleading his innocence, Kwang Soo runs towards Haha.)

625
00:22:05,951 --> 00:22:07,851
- Hey, hey! What did you do? - Wait.

626
00:22:07,852 --> 00:22:11,091
- Did you just look at my name tag? - It's not me!

627
00:22:11,092 --> 00:22:12,291
He wanted my name tag!

628
00:22:12,292 --> 00:22:13,891
No! It's not me!

629
00:22:13,892 --> 00:22:15,260
- It could be Hee Jin. - You were looking at it!

630
00:22:15,261 --> 00:22:17,430
It's not me. I didn't look at your name tag.

631
00:22:17,431 --> 00:22:20,098
Bona, scream.

632
00:22:20,471 --> 00:22:22,563
(That means "Don't come near me.)

633
00:22:22,701 --> 00:22:24,571
Good. Good job.

634
00:22:24,572 --> 00:22:26,692
- What are you doing? - Now, run away.

635
00:22:27,042 --> 00:22:28,541
I'll keep them here.

636
00:22:28,542 --> 00:22:29,841
- It's really not me. - This way?

637
00:22:29,842 --> 00:22:33,719
I'm really not the secret couple, but Kwang Soo is!

638
00:22:34,052 --> 00:22:35,420
Come on, Bona!

639
00:22:35,421 --> 00:22:36,836
This is driving me crazy.

640
00:22:36,921 --> 00:22:39,548
She keeps doing suspicious things.

641
00:22:40,852 --> 00:22:42,091
Kwang Soo...

642
00:22:42,092 --> 00:22:43,375
Don't come near me.

643
00:22:43,522 --> 00:22:45,480
- You're making them suspect me! - It's you!

644
00:22:45,632 --> 00:22:47,430
- Don't put the blame on me! - Come here.

645
00:22:47,431 --> 00:22:49,048
No, come here.

646
00:22:49,731 --> 00:22:52,101
Kwang Soo, I know that it's you.

647
00:22:52,102 --> 00:22:53,717
(Could the secret couple be one of them?)

648
00:22:54,032 --> 00:22:56,170
I really have no clue.

649
00:22:56,171 --> 00:22:58,333
(Jae Young, another candidate, is looking for hints alone.)

650
00:22:58,772 --> 00:23:00,710
Hey, I got one.

651
00:23:00,711 --> 00:23:02,156
(At that moment,)

652
00:23:03,082 --> 00:23:06,385
(he finds a hint.)

653
00:23:07,382 --> 00:23:10,209
(What does this hint say?)

654
00:23:10,681 --> 00:23:11,920
(The male of the secret couple is an actor.)

655
00:23:11,921 --> 00:23:14,578
(Lee Kwang Soo, Kim Jae Young)

656
00:23:15,292 --> 00:23:18,291
(There are only two actors.)

657
00:23:20,292 --> 00:23:25,079
(After reading it, he hurriedly hides it.)

658
00:23:25,731 --> 00:23:27,014
(Looking around)

659
00:23:28,941 --> 00:23:31,436
That was close. Goodness.

660
00:23:32,272 --> 00:23:35,008
I should get rid of them.

661
00:23:35,181 --> 00:23:38,181
(What does that mean?)

662
00:23:38,711 --> 00:23:40,480
Today's race will be called...

663
00:23:40,481 --> 00:23:43,350
Secret Couple Amid the Battle of Singles.

664
00:23:44,721 --> 00:23:47,091
And you two are the secret couple,

665
00:23:47,092 --> 00:23:49,061
hidden among the single members.

666
00:23:49,062 --> 00:23:50,537
(Jae Young was the male.)

667
00:23:50,862 --> 00:23:52,407
Okay. Thank you.

668
00:23:52,991 --> 00:23:55,430
There's a way for you guys to eliminate the others...

669
00:23:55,431 --> 00:23:57,624
during the race.

670
00:23:58,171 --> 00:24:00,230
If you suspect someone of being a relationship virgin, you can...

671
00:24:00,231 --> 00:24:01,641
(They need to do something.)

672
00:24:01,642 --> 00:24:04,096
Only then, you'll be able to remove their name tag.

673
00:24:04,201 --> 00:24:06,111
If that individual is not a relationship virgin,

674
00:24:06,112 --> 00:24:08,939
a crucial hint about you two will be revealed to the others.

675
00:24:10,911 --> 00:24:11,910
(Secret couple)

676
00:24:11,911 --> 00:24:18,861
(Kim Jae Young was the male of the secret couple.)

677
00:24:20,592 --> 00:24:22,660
No one is showing me their hints.

678
00:24:22,661 --> 00:24:24,137
- It's not you, right? - No, it's not.

679
00:24:24,221 --> 00:24:26,656
It's not me either. Then it's Hee Jin.

680
00:24:26,731 --> 00:24:29,061
But I have no way to find out since I have no hints.

681
00:24:29,062 --> 00:24:31,758
And they won't show theirs either. They just won't show me.

682
00:24:31,872 --> 00:24:34,296
Let's look for hints and exchange them.

683
00:24:35,171 --> 00:24:37,271
I'm really desperate to know anything,

684
00:24:37,272 --> 00:24:39,190
whether it be about the relationship virgin or the secret couple.

685
00:24:39,342 --> 00:24:41,881
I just want to know.

686
00:24:41,882 --> 00:24:43,811
(While So Min is busy with her soliloquy,)

687
00:24:43,812 --> 00:24:46,881
(Ji Hyo finds a hint.)

688
00:24:46,882 --> 00:24:48,381
You got one! Awesome!

689
00:24:48,382 --> 00:24:50,239
Ji Hyo, let's share it.

690
00:24:51,721 --> 00:24:55,055
(She has found one!)

691
00:24:55,661 --> 00:24:56,974
Ji Hyo.

692
00:24:57,261 --> 00:24:59,483
Please don't do this to me.

693
00:25:00,132 --> 00:25:02,686
(Ignoring)

694
00:25:02,862 --> 00:25:04,200
(What does her hint say?)

695
00:25:04,201 --> 00:25:05,700
(The relationship virgin is a male in his 40s.)

696
00:25:05,701 --> 00:25:07,186
(Excluded: Seok Jin, Kwang Soo, Se Chan, Jae Young)

697
00:25:07,731 --> 00:25:09,940
(Judging by the previous hints, it's either Jong Kook or Jae Seok.)

698
00:25:09,941 --> 00:25:11,053
I'm an outcast.

699
00:25:11,612 --> 00:25:12,985
I'm certain.

700
00:25:13,642 --> 00:25:15,904
She pretty much sealed the deal just now.

701
00:25:18,082 --> 00:25:19,680
(Seok Jin approaches Ji Hyo, a strong candidate.)

702
00:25:19,681 --> 00:25:20,823
Are you going down?

703
00:25:22,951 --> 00:25:24,420
You're very suspicious.

704
00:25:24,421 --> 00:25:28,764
- What? I didn't do anything. - Why would you grab his hand?

705
00:25:28,792 --> 00:25:30,720
- It's a mission, right? - You can't just listen...

706
00:25:30,721 --> 00:25:32,460
to Jong Kook's side of the story.

707
00:25:32,461 --> 00:25:34,331
Why would you grab his hand?

708
00:25:34,332 --> 00:25:35,745
Jong Kook said to me,

709
00:25:36,332 --> 00:25:39,601
"If you're a couple, you probably have a mission."

710
00:25:39,602 --> 00:25:42,440
So I just played along, said yes, and grabbed Jae Young's hand.

711
00:25:42,441 --> 00:25:43,670
- All right. - It was really nothing.

712
00:25:43,671 --> 00:25:44,970
I'm serious.

713
00:25:44,971 --> 00:25:46,670
Jong Kook seems to be accusing you quite a lot today.

714
00:25:46,671 --> 00:25:50,311
- I know. You know how... - Right? Isn't he weird?

715
00:25:50,312 --> 00:25:51,611
Jong Kook tends to corner...

716
00:25:51,612 --> 00:25:53,081
- those around them... - Right.

717
00:25:53,082 --> 00:25:56,081
- when he receives a mission? - Everyone's suspicious.

718
00:25:56,082 --> 00:25:59,020
Wouldn't the hints be hidden...

719
00:25:59,052 --> 00:26:00,391
in places like this?

720
00:26:00,392 --> 00:26:01,462
(Jong Kook accused Ji Hyo and Jae Young all day.)

721
00:26:02,491 --> 00:26:07,361
(He claims that the two were being suspicious.)

722
00:26:07,362 --> 00:26:14,169
(He suspected them for the smallest things.)

723
00:26:15,872 --> 00:26:18,771
(He's been acting like a detective all day long.)

724
00:26:18,772 --> 00:26:21,680
(Could he be the relationship virgin?)

725
00:26:21,681 --> 00:26:24,741
I'll be susceptible to attacks if I'm in remote places.

726
00:26:25,711 --> 00:26:27,601
Let me see. There's someone over there.

727
00:26:28,522 --> 00:26:34,451
(Someone has been following him.)

728
00:26:34,862 --> 00:26:37,750
(It's Ji Hyo.)

729
00:26:38,691 --> 00:26:40,631
(It's me.)

730
00:26:40,632 --> 00:26:41,742
Wait.

731
00:26:42,501 --> 00:26:43,613
You're strange.

732
00:26:43,802 --> 00:26:45,700
I should be here.

733
00:26:45,701 --> 00:26:47,430
- It's dangerous. - I was joking around.

734
00:26:47,431 --> 00:26:50,836
No. Aren't you dying to eliminate me since I've been accusing you?

735
00:26:51,572 --> 00:26:53,490
That's our show's pattern.

736
00:26:54,142 --> 00:26:56,909
(The one who suspects the most will be eliminated the earliest.)

737
00:26:57,582 --> 00:27:01,390
(Jong Kook continues searching for hints.)

738
00:27:01,981 --> 00:27:02,980
(And Ji Hyo tails him.)

739
00:27:02,981 --> 00:27:05,445
Look at her face. How strange.

740
00:27:05,691 --> 00:27:07,450
Walk past me.

741
00:27:07,451 --> 00:27:09,006
Go. Pass.

742
00:27:09,461 --> 00:27:10,621
Whom did you call?

743
00:27:10,622 --> 00:27:12,260
(Did you call someone over?)

744
00:27:12,261 --> 00:27:14,591
(At that moment,)

745
00:27:14,592 --> 00:27:16,801
(Jae Young, one of the secret couple, appears.)

746
00:27:16,802 --> 00:27:18,075
Could it be here?

747
00:27:19,401 --> 00:27:20,670
What was that?

748
00:27:20,671 --> 00:27:24,509
(He hears Jong Kook's voice.)

749
00:27:27,142 --> 00:27:29,410
(Ji Hyo being in this remote library feels suspicious for him.)

750
00:27:29,411 --> 00:27:30,522
No way.

751
00:27:32,981 --> 00:27:33,980
Where is he?

752
00:27:33,981 --> 00:27:35,180
(He carefully approaches Jong Kook.)

753
00:27:35,181 --> 00:27:36,191
Hello.

754
00:27:36,221 --> 00:27:38,180
- Hey, did you find any hints? - Yes.

755
00:27:38,181 --> 00:27:39,851
You're not a part of the secret couple.

756
00:27:39,852 --> 00:27:40,851
Let me see.

757
00:27:40,852 --> 00:27:43,791
(He distracts Jong Kook with his hint.)

758
00:27:43,792 --> 00:27:45,591
(Jong Kook takes the bait.)

759
00:27:45,592 --> 00:27:46,791
Even dates?

760
00:27:46,792 --> 00:27:49,023
Right, I was born on the 25th.

761
00:27:50,461 --> 00:27:53,128
(This is his chance.)

762
00:27:55,201 --> 00:27:56,484
I'm sorry, Jong Kook.

763
00:27:57,171 --> 00:27:59,940
(In a blink of an eye, Kim Jong Kook is out.)

764
00:27:59,941 --> 00:28:04,223
(If he's the relationship virgin, this race is over.)

765
00:28:05,582 --> 00:28:07,732
- Yes, it's me. - How dare you?

766
00:28:08,552 --> 00:28:11,420
(He's not the relationship virgin.)

767
00:28:11,421 --> 00:28:12,806
Come here.

768
00:28:12,852 --> 00:28:15,621
- I knew it. - I'm sorry.

769
00:28:15,622 --> 00:28:17,237
(If Jong Kook is not the relationship virgin,)

770
00:28:17,362 --> 00:28:18,391
Hey.

771
00:28:18,392 --> 00:28:19,806
(Jae Seok is the only remaining candidate.)

772
00:28:19,892 --> 00:28:21,591
If I get eliminated, the race is over.

773
00:28:21,592 --> 00:28:23,160
(Listen carefully.)

774
00:28:23,161 --> 00:28:24,361
- By whom? - It's true.

775
00:28:24,362 --> 00:28:26,531
- By the secret couple. - Why are you telling me now?

776
00:28:26,532 --> 00:28:28,700
- You're the relationship virgin? - I must watch out.

777
00:28:28,701 --> 00:28:29,884
(What is his identity?)

778
00:28:30,241 --> 00:28:31,240
(This morning, before the opening scene)

779
00:28:31,241 --> 00:28:34,544
Jae Seok, you're the ace among the single members.

780
00:28:35,082 --> 00:28:36,440
You're the relationship virgin.

781
00:28:36,441 --> 00:28:38,058
(He was indeed the relationship virgin.)

782
00:28:38,211 --> 00:28:40,404
(They chose the relationship virgin based on his appearance.)

783
00:28:41,352 --> 00:28:42,594
Let me emphasize this.

784
00:28:43,251 --> 00:28:45,110
If I'm out, this race is over.

785
00:28:45,592 --> 00:28:46,750
- What? - Haha,

786
00:28:46,751 --> 00:28:48,913
- this is our guess. - Be quiet.

787
00:28:49,862 --> 00:28:51,679
If I get eliminated, this is all over.

788
00:28:53,261 --> 00:28:54,490
- Got it? - You should...

789
00:28:54,491 --> 00:28:56,000
- What's your mission? - be careful.

790
00:28:56,001 --> 00:28:57,260
This is bad.

791
00:28:57,261 --> 00:29:00,503
(He realizes that he ripped the wrong name tag.)

792
00:29:02,001 --> 00:29:04,021
Kim Jong Kook,

793
00:29:04,872 --> 00:29:07,510
a single member, is out.

794
00:29:07,511 --> 00:29:08,541
He's out?

795
00:29:08,542 --> 00:29:10,611
Kim Jong Kook, a single member, is out.

796
00:29:10,612 --> 00:29:11,611
What?

797
00:29:11,612 --> 00:29:12,611
(It's a bolt out of the blue.)

798
00:29:12,612 --> 00:29:14,450
How was he eliminated?

799
00:29:14,451 --> 00:29:16,220
- How was he out? - Not knowing that is scary.

800
00:29:16,221 --> 00:29:18,990
- Because... - I will now give you...

801
00:29:18,991 --> 00:29:20,950
a crucial hint regarding the secret couple.

802
00:29:20,951 --> 00:29:22,621
- For free. - Jong Kook is out?

803
00:29:22,622 --> 00:29:27,106
(Their 1st trial will start in 5 minutes. What is the hint?)

804
00:29:27,191 --> 00:29:29,460
The male of the secret couple...

805
00:29:29,461 --> 00:29:30,801
(The male of the secret couple is...)

806
00:29:30,802 --> 00:29:32,470
debuted as a model.

807
00:29:32,471 --> 00:29:35,601
- Then... - That's why I suspected Jae Young.

808
00:29:35,602 --> 00:29:38,170
(There are only two candidates.)

809
00:29:38,171 --> 00:29:40,510
- It's either Jae Young... - Or Kwang Soo.

810
00:29:40,511 --> 00:29:41,841
It's 1 of those 2.

811
00:29:41,842 --> 00:29:42,841
Seok Jin can never be a model.

812
00:29:42,842 --> 00:29:44,381
He debuted as a model.

813
00:29:44,382 --> 00:29:45,594
(Kwang Soo hears the hint as well.)

814
00:29:49,151 --> 00:29:50,869
To be frank, I didn't debut as a model.

815
00:29:51,622 --> 00:29:52,690
(I'm just a tall comedian.)

816
00:29:52,691 --> 00:29:54,509
I can't say that I was a model.

817
00:29:56,592 --> 00:29:58,712
Who wrote this hint? Never mind. Fine.

818
00:29:58,792 --> 00:30:02,033
My goodness. I wonder who came up with this hint.

819
00:30:02,802 --> 00:30:03,812
I'm not sure.

820
00:30:04,961 --> 00:30:06,500
It's Jae Young.

821
00:30:06,501 --> 00:30:08,000
(He finally realizes.)

822
00:30:08,001 --> 00:30:10,526
Then it's So Min and Jae Young.

823
00:30:10,671 --> 00:30:13,298
No, wait. Is it Hee Jin?

824
00:30:13,812 --> 00:30:15,781
(He doesn't know who the female is.)

825
00:30:15,782 --> 00:30:17,225
So it's Jae Young?

826
00:30:17,882 --> 00:30:19,180
It could be you.

827
00:30:19,181 --> 00:30:20,381
What do you mean?

828
00:30:20,382 --> 00:30:22,472
What kind of nonsense are you spewing?

829
00:30:22,721 --> 00:30:24,781
- What are you talking about? - There are only two models.

830
00:30:24,782 --> 00:30:27,091
Right, but I'm not the one.

831
00:30:27,092 --> 00:30:28,809
(You guys picked Jae Young.)

832
00:30:29,622 --> 00:30:31,190
Darn it.

833
00:30:31,191 --> 00:30:32,430
(No one is on his side.)

834
00:30:32,431 --> 00:30:33,891
I'm flabbergasted.

835
00:30:33,892 --> 00:30:38,230
(He needs to prove to the others that he's innocent.)

836
00:30:38,231 --> 00:30:39,282
Wait a minute.

837
00:30:39,731 --> 00:30:42,328
(He finds the single members.)

838
00:30:42,741 --> 00:30:44,700
(He runs towards them to plead his innocence.)

839
00:30:44,701 --> 00:30:45,771
Be careful.

840
00:30:45,772 --> 00:30:47,670
- Seok Jin, we need to run. - It's Kwang Soo.

841
00:30:47,671 --> 00:30:49,257
- It's him. - Let's run away.

842
00:30:49,582 --> 00:30:51,881
It's not me! It isn't!

843
00:30:51,882 --> 00:30:52,892
(Where are you all going?)

844
00:30:53,481 --> 00:30:54,521
It's not me!

845
00:30:55,251 --> 00:30:56,680
(They block him.)

846
00:30:56,681 --> 00:30:58,509
Hey! Where are you?

847
00:30:59,052 --> 00:31:01,819
(I'm an innocent single member just like you!)

848
00:31:02,491 --> 00:31:03,591
- Hey. - Seok Jin.

849
00:31:03,592 --> 00:31:04,591
Darn it.

850
00:31:04,592 --> 00:31:05,960
- It's not me. - It is you.

851
00:31:05,961 --> 00:31:08,083
- I promise. - I know it's you.

852
00:31:08,231 --> 00:31:09,531
- I can't prove it, though. - I heard the hint.

853
00:31:09,532 --> 00:31:11,177
The male member debuted as a model.

854
00:31:11,261 --> 00:31:12,585
I'm innocent.

855
00:31:12,802 --> 00:31:14,792
- Hey! - I'm really innocent.

856
00:31:15,001 --> 00:31:16,415
It's not me.

857
00:31:17,602 --> 00:31:18,784
It really isn't me.

858
00:31:19,372 --> 00:31:21,710
- His face looks suspicious. - I know.

859
00:31:21,711 --> 00:31:24,311
His facial expressions look so suspicious.

860
00:31:24,312 --> 00:31:26,028
- I'm serious. - I couldn't sleep much yesterday.

861
00:31:26,082 --> 00:31:28,250
It's because my eyes look sunken, but I'm not the one.

862
00:31:28,251 --> 00:31:29,695
(At that moment,)

863
00:31:30,151 --> 00:31:32,591
(the two models finally meet.)

864
00:31:32,592 --> 00:31:34,621
- Hey, it's not me. - How did you eliminate Jong Kook?

865
00:31:34,622 --> 00:31:36,220
(Hear me out.)

866
00:31:36,221 --> 00:31:38,180
(You're impressive, Kwang Soo.)

867
00:31:39,062 --> 00:31:40,102
You.

868
00:31:40,431 --> 00:31:42,200
It's really not me.

869
00:31:42,201 --> 00:31:43,200
What is this?

870
00:31:43,201 --> 00:31:44,531
- It's Jae Young. - It's Kwang Soo.

871
00:31:44,532 --> 00:31:46,331
- It's Jae Young. - Why do you think so?

872
00:31:46,332 --> 00:31:47,930
- If it's not me, it's him. - Right.

873
00:31:47,931 --> 00:31:50,022
I swear that it's not me. You'll know.

874
00:31:50,042 --> 00:31:51,470
- It's not me, either. - This doesn't make sense.

875
00:31:51,471 --> 00:31:53,071
- I don't know. - Why wouldn't this make sense?

876
00:31:53,072 --> 00:31:55,311
You spent the day with me. Shouldn't you know?

877
00:31:55,312 --> 00:31:57,141
(Jae Young is happy with Kwang Soo's irrational explanation.)

878
00:31:57,142 --> 00:31:58,281
It was you.

879
00:31:58,282 --> 00:32:00,271
(What will become of their fates?)

880
00:32:02,082 --> 00:32:04,180
It's time for our first trial.

881
00:32:04,181 --> 00:32:05,736
Let's head towards the court.

882
00:32:06,691 --> 00:32:08,267
Jong Kook was out.

883
00:32:08,421 --> 00:32:10,846
He's been getting eliminated first these past weeks.

884
00:32:11,322 --> 00:32:13,091
This is the first trial.

885
00:32:13,092 --> 00:32:14,490
For this trial,

886
00:32:14,491 --> 00:32:16,500
you will only choose one individual...

887
00:32:16,501 --> 00:32:17,960
who seems the most suspicious.

888
00:32:17,961 --> 00:32:19,371
(Only one of them will be judged.)

889
00:32:19,372 --> 00:32:20,382
Just one?

890
00:32:20,471 --> 00:32:21,771
It should be male.

891
00:32:21,772 --> 00:32:24,071
Either Jae Young or Kwang Soo.

892
00:32:24,072 --> 00:32:26,371
Yes. He's right.

893
00:32:26,372 --> 00:32:28,581
Should we pick Kwang Soo or Jae Young?

894
00:32:28,582 --> 00:32:29,955
I'm truly innocent.

895
00:32:30,441 --> 00:32:32,081
This is bad.

896
00:32:32,082 --> 00:32:33,311
(If they can't catch him, the second half will be difficult.)

897
00:32:33,312 --> 00:32:35,028
- Is it you? - No, it's not.

898
00:32:35,522 --> 00:32:36,865
It's Kwang Soo.

899
00:32:37,082 --> 00:32:38,351
It's one of them for sure.

900
00:32:38,352 --> 00:32:39,967
Yes, you're right.

901
00:32:40,322 --> 00:32:42,312
We're so close to catching him.

902
00:32:42,461 --> 00:32:43,490
- Listen. - Let's do it.

903
00:32:43,491 --> 00:32:45,331
- What? - It's not me.

904
00:32:45,332 --> 00:32:46,631
I'll say one thing.

905
00:32:46,632 --> 00:32:48,531
- I wasn't going to say this. - You better not lie.

906
00:32:48,532 --> 00:32:51,601
But I found a crucial hint.

907
00:32:51,602 --> 00:32:53,071
(He seems to know something.)

908
00:32:53,072 --> 00:32:54,230
What is it?

909
00:32:54,231 --> 00:32:57,970
(There was a hint that Kwang Soo didn't reveal.)

910
00:32:57,971 --> 00:33:01,274
(What is this crucial hint?)

911
00:33:01,642 --> 00:33:03,499
(20 minutes ago)

912
00:33:04,941 --> 00:33:07,708
(He found a hint.)

913
00:33:10,552 --> 00:33:13,391
(After reading it, he was at a loss for words.)

914
00:33:13,392 --> 00:33:16,521
(He saved it for this moment.)

915
00:33:16,522 --> 00:33:17,805
(Nervous)

916
00:33:19,062 --> 00:33:20,430
You fabricated it, right?

917
00:33:20,431 --> 00:33:22,219
(Jae Seok can't trust Kwang Soo.)

918
00:33:22,961 --> 00:33:24,548
- My goodness. - I'm 100-percent sure you did.

919
00:33:24,832 --> 00:33:26,371
(He's been known to fabricate hints.)

920
00:33:26,372 --> 00:33:28,101
- I'm sure you did. - No, you'll see.

921
00:33:28,102 --> 00:33:30,940
- Let me see. - He fabricated it.

922
00:33:30,941 --> 00:33:32,740
- Let me see. - I can't show you...

923
00:33:32,741 --> 00:33:35,510
because it's a hint about the relationship virgin.

924
00:33:35,511 --> 00:33:37,330
(It's too dangerous to reveal the relationship virgin's identity.)

925
00:33:37,441 --> 00:33:38,781
- Then you shouldn't reveal it. - Right.

926
00:33:38,782 --> 00:33:41,942
Did any of you hear me talk about this hint?

927
00:33:42,151 --> 00:33:43,980
- Let me see. - Wait.

928
00:33:43,981 --> 00:33:45,621
- If I show it... - The relationship virgin...

929
00:33:45,622 --> 00:33:48,420
We need to check and see if he fabricated it or not.

930
00:33:48,421 --> 00:33:51,460
Wait. He can show it to me.

931
00:33:51,461 --> 00:33:52,990
- I can. - I'm a single member.

932
00:33:52,991 --> 00:33:54,430
- Me too. - I can.

933
00:33:54,431 --> 00:33:55,460
- Me too. - I can.

934
00:33:55,461 --> 00:33:57,331
That's why I didn't show this to anyone.

935
00:33:57,332 --> 00:33:58,631
- Show it to Haha and me. - Me too.

936
00:33:58,632 --> 00:33:59,914
I'll show it to all three of you.

937
00:34:00,872 --> 00:34:02,470
This will prove my innocence.

938
00:34:02,471 --> 00:34:04,170
- Okay, okay. - I will be...

939
00:34:04,171 --> 00:34:05,611
- We got it. - Let me plead my innocence!

940
00:34:05,612 --> 00:34:06,940
- Don't cry out. - We got it.

941
00:34:06,941 --> 00:34:10,311
(It looks like they just want to see the hint.)

942
00:34:10,312 --> 00:34:12,351
- I need to convince them. - All right.

943
00:34:12,352 --> 00:34:13,880
(Let me talk.)

944
00:34:13,881 --> 00:34:15,380
- Show it to us. - It's been a while...

945
00:34:15,381 --> 00:34:16,680
- since I found this hint. - We'll help you.

946
00:34:16,681 --> 00:34:18,251
- But I didn't show it to anyone. - Let us see.

947
00:34:18,252 --> 00:34:21,220
(This hint will prove of his innocence.)

948
00:34:21,221 --> 00:34:25,490
(If his innocence is proven, Jae Young will be judged.)

949
00:34:25,491 --> 00:34:27,855
(What is this hint?)

950
00:34:28,192 --> 00:34:29,211
(Darn it.)

951
00:34:29,301 --> 00:34:31,200
Are you serious?

952
00:34:31,201 --> 00:34:32,283
(He's flustered.)

953
00:34:32,471 --> 00:34:33,481
What is it?

954
00:34:33,801 --> 00:34:35,215
It's fake, isn't it?

955
00:34:35,471 --> 00:34:37,290
Why? What is it?

956
00:34:37,602 --> 00:34:39,871
("The relationship virgin is male.")

957
00:34:39,872 --> 00:34:41,671
- He must be in his dreams. - My goodness.

958
00:34:41,672 --> 00:34:44,081
I can't believe you. Just sit down!

959
00:34:44,082 --> 00:34:45,780
Whom are you trying to deceive?

960
00:34:45,781 --> 00:34:48,380
Why? This is a very important hint.

961
00:34:48,381 --> 00:34:49,880
We all know that.

962
00:34:49,881 --> 00:34:51,220
- We knew it. - Hey.

963
00:34:51,221 --> 00:34:53,590
How were you going to turn the tables with that?

964
00:34:53,591 --> 00:34:55,521
(They can't believe him.)

965
00:34:55,522 --> 00:34:56,561
(He thought no one else knew.)

966
00:34:56,562 --> 00:34:57,703
I thought only I knew.

967
00:34:58,562 --> 00:34:59,891
(Jae Young is relieved.)

968
00:34:59,892 --> 00:35:02,461
Jae Young, it's your turn to plead your innocence.

969
00:35:02,462 --> 00:35:04,987
I also shared my hint with you.

970
00:35:05,301 --> 00:35:07,149
If it were me,

971
00:35:07,471 --> 00:35:09,290
there would be no one else...

972
00:35:09,772 --> 00:35:10,871
- you'd suspect alongside me. - What?

973
00:35:10,872 --> 00:35:12,470
- What? - My partner.

974
00:35:12,471 --> 00:35:13,785
(He argues that there's no female partner they suspect.)

975
00:35:14,312 --> 00:35:16,260
No, we have one.

976
00:35:16,812 --> 00:35:18,731
- Actually, there are a few. - The one sitting next to you.

977
00:35:18,752 --> 00:35:20,081
Where were you when Jong Kook was eliminated?

978
00:35:20,082 --> 00:35:21,525
That's when I found this hint.

979
00:35:21,551 --> 00:35:23,220
(He's so proud.)

980
00:35:23,221 --> 00:35:24,550
(You can't help but suspect this scanty alibi.)

981
00:35:24,551 --> 00:35:26,005
Kwang Soo.

982
00:35:26,152 --> 00:35:27,536
- Kwang Soo. - I swear.

983
00:35:27,991 --> 00:35:30,083
- I really... Seriously. - Kwang Soo.

984
00:35:30,321 --> 00:35:31,635
- Who were you with? - I don't know.

985
00:35:31,661 --> 00:35:33,430
- I was alone. - Do you have a witness?

986
00:35:33,431 --> 00:35:36,057
Fashion design major... I was with the cameraman.

987
00:35:36,732 --> 00:35:38,231
We can't trust the cameraman.

988
00:35:38,232 --> 00:35:39,430
Where were you then, Jae Young?

989
00:35:39,431 --> 00:35:41,070
I came down from upstairs.

990
00:35:41,071 --> 00:35:42,617
- Who were you with? - I was alone.

991
00:35:43,341 --> 00:35:45,871
(They can't prove the validity of the alibi.)

992
00:35:45,872 --> 00:35:47,070
Let's do it this way.

993
00:35:47,071 --> 00:35:49,240
Let's think about who is easier for us to deal with,

994
00:35:49,241 --> 00:35:51,811
and give him a second chance.

995
00:35:51,812 --> 00:35:53,550
(Let's do this way.)

996
00:35:53,551 --> 00:35:56,050
(We should let the person who is easier for us to deal with survive.)

997
00:35:56,051 --> 00:35:57,899
- That's a good idea. - Yes, if Kwang Soo survives,

998
00:35:58,082 --> 00:36:00,041
- we'll be in trouble. - Things will get messy.

999
00:36:00,392 --> 00:36:02,038
- If Kwang Soo survives... - Wait.

1000
00:36:02,091 --> 00:36:03,172
Ji Hyo.

1001
00:36:03,392 --> 00:36:04,621
We need to be 100 hundred percent sure about this.

1002
00:36:04,622 --> 00:36:05,891
- Wait. - It's Kim Jae Young.

1003
00:36:05,892 --> 00:36:07,430
(Unlike Ji Hyo, Seok Jin suspects Jae Young.)

1004
00:36:07,431 --> 00:36:08,831
No, it's Kwang Soo.

1005
00:36:08,832 --> 00:36:10,347
Even if it's not Kwang Soo,

1006
00:36:10,402 --> 00:36:13,430
we can defend ourselves from Jae Young.

1007
00:36:13,431 --> 00:36:15,901
- We can't do that with Kwang Soo. - Please make a wise judgement.

1008
00:36:15,902 --> 00:36:17,240
- But Ji Hyo. - Yes.

1009
00:36:17,241 --> 00:36:19,910
(Hearing the explanation sparks curiosity.)

1010
00:36:19,911 --> 00:36:21,840
- Why are you defending Jae Young? - Right?

1011
00:36:21,841 --> 00:36:23,124
- Right? - That's what I'm talking about.

1012
00:36:23,741 --> 00:36:25,851
(Ji Hyo has been getting worked up to defend Jae Young.)

1013
00:36:25,852 --> 00:36:27,180
- Right? - Right? It's weird.

1014
00:36:27,181 --> 00:36:28,410
Since this morning...

1015
00:36:28,411 --> 00:36:30,351
It was weird that they were holding hands in the car too.

1016
00:36:30,352 --> 00:36:31,896
I swear that it's not what you think.

1017
00:36:32,152 --> 00:36:33,251
I swear that it's not what you think too.

1018
00:36:33,252 --> 00:36:34,621
I really swear that it's not what you think.

1019
00:36:34,622 --> 00:36:35,760
Me too.

1020
00:36:35,761 --> 00:36:38,387
(The battle of pledging)

1021
00:36:39,031 --> 00:36:40,577
- Because... - Who can't pledge?

1022
00:36:41,462 --> 00:36:44,895
(Kwang Soo has pledged over 300 times.)

1023
00:36:45,062 --> 00:36:46,271
(With no concrete proof)

1024
00:36:46,272 --> 00:36:47,483
I'm so confused.

1025
00:36:48,102 --> 00:36:49,516
You have to think about this carefully.

1026
00:36:50,272 --> 00:36:51,570
I'll tell you about this.

1027
00:36:51,571 --> 00:36:52,723
(Suddenly, he wants to talk about it.)

1028
00:36:52,942 --> 00:36:54,184
- This isn't a threat. - Yes.

1029
00:36:54,312 --> 00:36:55,410
If I go up now,

1030
00:36:55,411 --> 00:36:57,300
I will tell you the important hint...

1031
00:36:57,611 --> 00:36:59,711
- about the relationship virgin. - Everyone knows already.

1032
00:36:59,712 --> 00:37:00,751
(I'll share everything I know.)

1033
00:37:00,752 --> 00:37:02,024
- Everyone knows already. - Among us...

1034
00:37:02,281 --> 00:37:04,473
We know it already. We shared the hint.

1035
00:37:04,652 --> 00:37:06,421
- Do you? - We do.

1036
00:37:06,422 --> 00:37:08,090
Why would you threaten the relationship virgin...

1037
00:37:08,091 --> 00:37:09,778
when you're single?

1038
00:37:10,491 --> 00:37:12,630
- I just want to spoil everything. - Why?

1039
00:37:12,631 --> 00:37:13,691
(I have nothing to lose.)

1040
00:37:13,692 --> 00:37:15,530
(Kwang Soo just wants to wreak havoc.)

1041
00:37:15,531 --> 00:37:16,731
I'll be out of this. What does it matter?

1042
00:37:16,732 --> 00:37:17,901
Why? How could you do that?

1043
00:37:17,902 --> 00:37:19,719
- I hope everything fails. - We're a team.

1044
00:37:19,772 --> 00:37:21,630
I'll share this with the secret couple.

1045
00:37:21,631 --> 00:37:22,671
(Browbeating)

1046
00:37:22,672 --> 00:37:23,771
Get rid of me then. It's not me anyway.

1047
00:37:23,772 --> 00:37:25,488
I'm innocent.

1048
00:37:25,542 --> 00:37:27,110
I'll just sacrifice then.

1049
00:37:27,111 --> 00:37:29,340
(I'll just sacrifice then.)

1050
00:37:29,341 --> 00:37:31,503
- He's so cool. - Then...

1051
00:37:31,741 --> 00:37:33,450
If he wants to go, let's just send him.

1052
00:37:33,451 --> 00:37:36,007
(No hesitation)

1053
00:37:37,022 --> 00:37:38,566
- It's what he wants. - No.

1054
00:37:38,821 --> 00:37:40,791
- What? - Jae Young is so cool.

1055
00:37:40,792 --> 00:37:41,791
- He is. - Because...

1056
00:37:41,792 --> 00:37:43,820
- Kwang Soo. - you can choose him afterwards.

1057
00:37:43,821 --> 00:37:45,160
I'm even more confused now.

1058
00:37:45,161 --> 00:37:46,490
Let's start voting.

1059
00:37:46,491 --> 00:37:47,760
(First trial's voting starts along with Jae Young's smooth acting.)

1060
00:37:47,761 --> 00:37:49,316
Please tell us the results.

1061
00:37:49,402 --> 00:37:51,331
The voting results were very close.

1062
00:37:51,332 --> 00:37:52,816
- Right? - Were they close?

1063
00:37:53,471 --> 00:37:55,694
- Were they close? - Is it six to four, isn't it?

1064
00:37:55,902 --> 00:37:57,141
It's six to four.

1065
00:37:57,142 --> 00:37:59,240
- Really? - You were very lucky, Kwang Soo.

1066
00:37:59,241 --> 00:38:00,888
(You were very lucky, Kwang Soo.)

1067
00:38:01,341 --> 00:38:04,240
(Was Kwang Soo lucky?)

1068
00:38:04,241 --> 00:38:06,151
The person who is going to be judged is...

1069
00:38:06,152 --> 00:38:08,180
(Kwang Soo tried to create a mess with a useless hint.)

1070
00:38:08,181 --> 00:38:10,680
(Jae Young tried to gain trust with a bold strategy.)

1071
00:38:10,681 --> 00:38:11,981
(What will the results be?)

1072
00:38:11,982 --> 00:38:13,121
It's Lee Kwang Soo.

1073
00:38:13,122 --> 00:38:14,333
What do you mean that I'm lucky?

1074
00:38:15,091 --> 00:38:16,577
What do you mean that I'm lucky?

1075
00:38:17,122 --> 00:38:18,621
(You're lucky that you were picked by just one vote.)

1076
00:38:18,622 --> 00:38:20,176
You were lucky.

1077
00:38:20,261 --> 00:38:22,220
(Trying to control his facial expression.)

1078
00:38:22,531 --> 00:38:23,660
You were lucky.

1079
00:38:23,661 --> 00:38:25,590
1,2,

1080
00:38:26,531 --> 00:38:27,930
- 3. - Is he the one?

1081
00:38:27,931 --> 00:38:29,700
- No. - Look at that.

1082
00:38:29,701 --> 00:38:31,041
(Kwang Soo was just a single.)

1083
00:38:31,042 --> 00:38:33,070
(The back of a victimized man)

1084
00:38:33,071 --> 00:38:34,789
- Is it not? - I told you it Kim Jae Young.

1085
00:38:35,341 --> 00:38:38,380
- Is it Jae Young? - I told you that it was Jae Young.

1086
00:38:38,381 --> 00:38:39,880
(What should I do?)

1087
00:38:39,881 --> 00:38:41,180
I'm sorry.

1088
00:38:41,181 --> 00:38:42,921
(It is confirmed that Kim Jae Young is one of the secret couples.)

1089
00:38:42,922 --> 00:38:45,275
(What will be the fate of the secret couple?)

1090
00:38:46,152 --> 00:38:47,232
(The second half of the game starts.)

1091
00:38:47,892 --> 00:38:49,103
This isn't easy.

1092
00:38:49,122 --> 00:38:50,621
(Jae Young's strategy for the second half)

1093
00:38:50,622 --> 00:38:51,935
I'll hide near the emergency exit...

1094
00:38:53,531 --> 00:38:54,831
and wait for an opportunity.

1095
00:38:54,832 --> 00:38:56,246
(I'll hide near the emergency exit and look for an opportunity.)

1096
00:38:57,602 --> 00:38:59,070
We don't have much time.

1097
00:38:59,071 --> 00:39:01,231
How are we supposed to get him out?

1098
00:39:01,232 --> 00:39:02,840
(We need to find him first.)

1099
00:39:02,841 --> 00:39:04,501
- Hey. - Come here.

1100
00:39:04,502 --> 00:39:06,158
- Are you the relationship virgin? - I am.

1101
00:39:06,341 --> 00:39:07,453
Yes, I am.

1102
00:39:08,042 --> 00:39:10,010
I have to ride on their back or give them a piggyback.

1103
00:39:10,011 --> 00:39:11,180
(Jae Seok's way to eliminate the secret couple)

1104
00:39:11,181 --> 00:39:13,010
(One of the secret couple is out if the relationship virgin ride...)

1105
00:39:13,011 --> 00:39:14,870
(on the back of one of the secret couple or give them a piggyback)

1106
00:39:15,181 --> 00:39:18,283
- We will tell you something useful? - What is it?

1107
00:39:18,681 --> 00:39:19,791
If you give a piggyback to a member...

1108
00:39:19,792 --> 00:39:21,267
who is thought to be the secret couple,

1109
00:39:21,652 --> 00:39:24,021
or if you manage to ride on one of the secret couple's back,

1110
00:39:24,022 --> 00:39:25,537
the member will be out of the game immediately.

1111
00:39:26,591 --> 00:39:27,672
Do I need to ride on his or her back?

1112
00:39:28,031 --> 00:39:29,647
This is too difficult.

1113
00:39:29,801 --> 00:39:31,923
But if you get a member...

1114
00:39:31,931 --> 00:39:33,891
who's not a secret couple out of the game,

1115
00:39:34,431 --> 00:39:36,041
we will reveal the information...

1116
00:39:36,042 --> 00:39:37,658
- about you to everyone. - You will?

1117
00:39:38,801 --> 00:39:40,010
I see.

1118
00:39:40,011 --> 00:39:41,010
(Only the relationship virgin can get rid of the secret couples.)

1119
00:39:41,011 --> 00:39:43,311
- We have to find Jae Young. - Jae Young?

1120
00:39:43,312 --> 00:39:45,240
We aren't sure about Ji Hyo yet.

1121
00:39:45,241 --> 00:39:46,380
Let's get rid of Jae Young first.

1122
00:39:46,381 --> 00:39:48,099
We're going to be quite busy.

1123
00:39:48,381 --> 00:39:50,199
Se Chan, you go with Jae Seok.

1124
00:39:50,281 --> 00:39:51,796
I'll go with Seok Jin.

1125
00:39:52,022 --> 00:39:53,709
Let's go find him.

1126
00:39:54,292 --> 00:39:55,590
Jae Young might also have a way...

1127
00:39:55,591 --> 00:39:56,905
- to get rid of us. - You're right.

1128
00:39:57,321 --> 00:39:58,574
I don't think...

1129
00:39:58,792 --> 00:40:00,731
he has to remove our name tags to do that either.

1130
00:40:00,732 --> 00:40:01,860
I don't think so too.

1131
00:40:01,861 --> 00:40:04,101
- I think he has another way. - I'm sure he does.

1132
00:40:04,102 --> 00:40:05,646
He must have another way.

1133
00:40:07,631 --> 00:40:10,970
(On the other hand, Jae Young hides in the emergency exit.)

1134
00:40:10,971 --> 00:40:14,470
(When he's cornered, he can contact his partner only.)

1135
00:40:14,471 --> 00:40:16,740
(One of the three members is also going after...)

1136
00:40:16,741 --> 00:40:19,176
(the relationship virgin's name tag together with Jae Young.)

1137
00:40:19,951 --> 00:40:22,050
(First suspect, Jang Hee Jin)

1138
00:40:22,051 --> 00:40:23,769
I need to find the relationship virgin first.

1139
00:40:23,821 --> 00:40:25,771
Whatever happens, I need to find the relationship virgin.

1140
00:40:26,321 --> 00:40:29,121
(Hee Jin is obsessed to the hint about the relationship virgin.)

1141
00:40:29,122 --> 00:40:30,910
(Or...)

1142
00:40:31,361 --> 00:40:33,210
(Glimpsing)

1143
00:40:34,062 --> 00:40:36,657
(She looks at her phone secretly.)

1144
00:40:36,931 --> 00:40:40,871
(Ji Hyo keeps checking her phone when no one is around.)

1145
00:40:42,232 --> 00:40:43,601
(And one last person who is being suspicious.)

1146
00:40:43,602 --> 00:40:44,970
- She's acting suspiciously, right? - Yes, she is strange.

1147
00:40:44,971 --> 00:40:46,541
She keeps looking for us.

1148
00:40:46,542 --> 00:40:47,825
Se Chan.

1149
00:40:48,312 --> 00:40:51,880
(So Min keeps following these two around.)

1150
00:40:51,881 --> 00:40:53,063
Shall we run?

1151
00:40:54,781 --> 00:40:56,336
Why are you ignoring me?

1152
00:40:56,681 --> 00:40:58,950
I didn't do anything wrong. What's wrong?

1153
00:40:58,951 --> 00:41:00,134
- She is being weird. - Yes, she is.

1154
00:41:01,491 --> 00:41:03,310
- She's following us around. - I know.

1155
00:41:03,562 --> 00:41:04,720
(She keeps following Jae Seok who's known as the relationship virgin.)

1156
00:41:04,721 --> 00:41:05,791
She's always behind us.

1157
00:41:05,792 --> 00:41:06,942
It's weird.

1158
00:41:06,991 --> 00:41:09,123
Why would she do that? It's strange.

1159
00:41:09,361 --> 00:41:11,149
Why are you running away from me?

1160
00:41:11,161 --> 00:41:12,788
You know how much I trust you, right?

1161
00:41:14,402 --> 00:41:15,671
Let's just hide.

1162
00:41:15,672 --> 00:41:16,671
(They ditched So Min and continue to look for Jae Young.)

1163
00:41:16,672 --> 00:41:18,317
He hid himself really well.

1164
00:41:18,372 --> 00:41:19,856
I know, and it's a big place.

1165
00:41:21,011 --> 00:41:22,930
(Gosh)

1166
00:41:23,381 --> 00:41:24,811
It's a hint.

1167
00:41:24,812 --> 00:41:25,880
(While looking for Jae Young, they find this.)

1168
00:41:25,881 --> 00:41:28,740
(They discover a hint.)

1169
00:41:29,011 --> 00:41:32,314
(He finds a clue at the right timing.)

1170
00:41:32,721 --> 00:41:35,550
(What does it say?)

1171
00:41:35,551 --> 00:41:37,391
(The female partner of the secret couple...)

1172
00:41:37,392 --> 00:41:39,260
(a regular member of the show.)

1173
00:41:39,261 --> 00:41:41,590
(Hee Jin is excluded.)

1174
00:41:41,591 --> 00:41:46,030
(Ji Hyo or So Min is one of the secret couple.)

1175
00:41:46,031 --> 00:41:47,688
- It's not Hee Jin then. - It's So Min.

1176
00:41:47,732 --> 00:41:49,388
Wait, is it Ji Hyo?

1177
00:41:49,571 --> 00:41:51,117
- I'm so confused. - This is driving me mad.

1178
00:41:51,172 --> 00:41:52,252
Jae Seok.

1179
00:41:52,672 --> 00:41:53,884
We need to find Hee Jin.

1180
00:41:54,341 --> 00:41:55,655
- Hee Jin is not the secret couple. - Wait.

1181
00:41:56,281 --> 00:41:57,541
It's either Ji Hyo or So Min.

1182
00:41:57,542 --> 00:41:58,592
(The hint brings them back to the beginning.)

1183
00:41:59,312 --> 00:42:01,050
(They're worked out.)

1184
00:42:01,051 --> 00:42:02,180
Wait.

1185
00:42:02,181 --> 00:42:04,101
Is it So Min? Why did she keep following us?

1186
00:42:05,582 --> 00:42:10,571
(Suspect 1, So Min who kept following around Jae Seok)

1187
00:42:11,022 --> 00:42:14,293
The person who tried to protect Jae Young was one of those two.

1188
00:42:14,361 --> 00:42:16,430
- Ji Hyo? - Those two protected Jae Young.

1189
00:42:16,431 --> 00:42:18,078
(Ji Hyo tried too hard to protect Jae Young earlier.)

1190
00:42:18,102 --> 00:42:20,430
(20 minutes ago, during the trial)

1191
00:42:20,431 --> 00:42:22,189
(No, it's Kwang Soo.)

1192
00:42:22,672 --> 00:42:27,419
(Suspect 2, Ji Hyo who tried to protect Jae Young)

1193
00:42:29,212 --> 00:42:30,393
It's either one of them.

1194
00:42:31,042 --> 00:42:32,211
So Min...

1195
00:42:32,212 --> 00:42:34,180
- I'll try riding on Ji Hyo... - It's one of the two.

1196
00:42:34,181 --> 00:42:35,323
or So Min's back,

1197
00:42:35,381 --> 00:42:37,351
- but what if I'm wrong? - If you're wrong?

1198
00:42:37,352 --> 00:42:38,694
Then we're done for.

1199
00:42:38,881 --> 00:42:41,090
We can only get rid of one person by the voting.

1200
00:42:41,091 --> 00:42:43,546
Since we already know it's Jae Young, we need to vote him out.

1201
00:42:43,591 --> 00:42:45,713
But I might be out of this game if things go wrong.

1202
00:42:46,732 --> 00:42:49,489
The problem is that we don't know how they'll get rid of me.

1203
00:42:50,261 --> 00:42:52,858
(What should we do about this?)

1204
00:42:53,272 --> 00:42:56,271
(Hee Jin who's proven to be a single appears.)

1205
00:42:56,402 --> 00:42:59,098
I think the person who's the nearest...

1206
00:42:59,611 --> 00:43:01,693
to Jae Young is the culprit.

1207
00:43:03,982 --> 00:43:07,380
(She discovers Jae Young.)

1208
00:43:07,381 --> 00:43:09,380
(Her footsteps quieten.)

1209
00:43:09,381 --> 00:43:11,239
(Carefully)

1210
00:43:12,022 --> 00:43:13,450
I think if I follow Jae young around,

1211
00:43:13,451 --> 00:43:14,966
someone will appear.

1212
00:43:15,652 --> 00:43:16,760
It's him.

1213
00:43:16,761 --> 00:43:18,121
(Hee Jin's strategy is to trail the secret couple's meetup.)

1214
00:43:18,122 --> 00:43:19,272
Is he running away?

1215
00:43:19,732 --> 00:43:20,891
Isn't he running away?

1216
00:43:20,892 --> 00:43:22,601
(Jae Young is escaping with quick footsteps...)

1217
00:43:22,602 --> 00:43:24,854
(but he suddenly stops.)

1218
00:43:25,031 --> 00:43:26,171
I'm here early.

1219
00:43:26,172 --> 00:43:27,970
(He waits for someone.)

1220
00:43:27,971 --> 00:43:29,082
Why isn't she here?

1221
00:43:29,502 --> 00:43:32,067
(Did he see someone?)

1222
00:43:32,442 --> 00:43:35,410
(In the direction of where he was looking at,)

1223
00:43:35,411 --> 00:43:38,610
(Ji Hyo appears.)

1224
00:43:38,611 --> 00:43:42,045
(She carefully approaches Jae Young while looking around.)

1225
00:43:42,582 --> 00:43:44,220
(Jae Young...)

1226
00:43:44,221 --> 00:43:46,373
(also approaches Ji Hyo.)

1227
00:43:48,821 --> 00:43:49,990
Who is that?

1228
00:43:49,991 --> 00:43:51,260
That's right. It's Song Ji Hyo.

1229
00:43:51,261 --> 00:43:53,817
(That's right. It's Song Ji Hyo.)

1230
00:43:54,531 --> 00:43:55,744
That's right. It's Song Ji Hyo.

1231
00:43:56,562 --> 00:43:57,901
I knew it.

1232
00:43:57,902 --> 00:44:01,840
(Then, these two people run off in different directions.)

1233
00:44:02,502 --> 00:44:03,653
What?

1234
00:44:04,142 --> 00:44:05,353
Why are they running away?

1235
00:44:06,241 --> 00:44:07,483
Why are they running away?

1236
00:44:07,772 --> 00:44:09,641
(Ji Hyo runs away with no reason...)

1237
00:44:09,642 --> 00:44:11,981
(and Hee Jin finds this suspicious.)

1238
00:44:11,982 --> 00:44:13,164
Why are they running away?

1239
00:44:13,411 --> 00:44:14,610
(She catches her at a dead end.)

1240
00:44:14,611 --> 00:44:15,793
- Do you want my name tag? - Why are you running away?

1241
00:44:16,881 --> 00:44:18,194
- Do you want my name tag? - Why are you running away?

1242
00:44:18,881 --> 00:44:21,377
I saw you having a lovely time with your partner.

1243
00:44:21,652 --> 00:44:23,843
- What? A couple should... - Ji Hyo.

1244
00:44:24,192 --> 00:44:25,391
You're caught.

1245
00:44:25,392 --> 00:44:27,816
I was trailing Jae Young around.

1246
00:44:27,861 --> 00:44:29,300
- What are you on about? - But...

1247
00:44:29,301 --> 00:44:30,461
you appeared.

1248
00:44:30,462 --> 00:44:31,461
(Are you the secret couple?)

1249
00:44:31,462 --> 00:44:33,148
- Hee Jin. - And you told him...

1250
00:44:33,172 --> 00:44:34,211
"don't come closer."

1251
00:44:34,372 --> 00:44:35,815
I swear it's not me.

1252
00:44:36,672 --> 00:44:37,884
It's really not me.

1253
00:44:38,902 --> 00:44:41,010
Wait. Isn't that Jae Young?

1254
00:44:41,011 --> 00:44:42,110
- Where? - It's Jae Young.

1255
00:44:42,111 --> 00:44:43,141
- Where? - Over there.

1256
00:44:43,142 --> 00:44:44,455
He went over there.

1257
00:44:44,812 --> 00:44:46,095
He went over there. To that side.

1258
00:44:46,482 --> 00:44:47,593
This way.

1259
00:44:48,011 --> 00:44:49,638
He's there. Catch him.

1260
00:44:50,221 --> 00:44:52,621
(One of the secret couple, Kim Jae Young is found.)

1261
00:44:52,622 --> 00:44:54,611
(There are two of them.)

1262
00:44:54,721 --> 00:44:55,934
- Hey. - Hurry up.

1263
00:44:56,462 --> 00:44:57,691
- Come this way. - Where?

1264
00:44:57,692 --> 00:44:58,921
- Hee Jin. Wait. - Hurry.

1265
00:44:58,922 --> 00:44:59,961
- Wait. - Corner him.

1266
00:44:59,962 --> 00:45:00,961
Be careful.

1267
00:45:00,962 --> 00:45:01,972
Seok Jin.

1268
00:45:02,332 --> 00:45:03,461
The eighth floor.

1269
00:45:03,462 --> 00:45:04,901
(Jae Young couldn't attack Jae Seok and escapes to a hideout.)

1270
00:45:04,902 --> 00:45:05,970
It's Jae Young.

1271
00:45:05,971 --> 00:45:09,271
(Right then, the oldest solo was walking around the upper floor.)

1272
00:45:09,272 --> 00:45:11,001
- Come this way. - It's Jae Young.

1273
00:45:11,002 --> 00:45:12,386
- Gosh. - Jae Young is over there.

1274
00:45:13,042 --> 00:45:14,541
- Catch him. - No.

1275
00:45:14,542 --> 00:45:15,854
(The solo army unites as one.)

1276
00:45:16,042 --> 00:45:17,240
Gosh, he's...

1277
00:45:17,241 --> 00:45:18,454
- Catch him. - Let's go this way.

1278
00:45:18,881 --> 00:45:21,406
Wait. What's the point of catching me?

1279
00:45:22,111 --> 00:45:23,180
(Jae Young gets caught.)

1280
00:45:23,181 --> 00:45:25,280
There's nothing you can do after catching me.

1281
00:45:25,281 --> 00:45:27,450
- Hey. - Hold him tight.

1282
00:45:27,451 --> 00:45:28,691
We just need to eliminate him.

1283
00:45:28,692 --> 00:45:30,610
- How did you guys know? - It's not me.

1284
00:45:30,991 --> 00:45:33,260
Jae Seok, get him!

1285
00:45:33,261 --> 00:45:36,363
(The relationship virgin rides on his back.)

1286
00:45:36,902 --> 00:45:39,501
(His attempt to attack Jae Young is a success!)

1287
00:45:39,502 --> 00:45:40,785
Good.

1288
00:45:41,002 --> 00:45:42,070
Get him!

1289
00:45:42,071 --> 00:45:46,171
The male of the secret couple, Kim Jae Young is eliminated.

1290
00:45:46,172 --> 00:45:48,410
- We got him now. - We got him.

1291
00:45:48,411 --> 00:45:49,594
- Good. - We got him.

1292
00:45:50,042 --> 00:45:51,211
So that was his skill.

1293
00:45:51,212 --> 00:45:52,441
Could it be So Min?

1294
00:45:52,442 --> 00:45:53,910
I think it's So Min.

1295
00:45:53,911 --> 00:45:55,366
So Min tried to protect him.

1296
00:45:56,051 --> 00:45:58,621
- Me? You guys are mean. - So Min, I thought we were friends!

1297
00:45:58,622 --> 00:46:00,550
This is driving me crazy.

1298
00:46:00,551 --> 00:46:02,291
- Or is it Ji Hyo again? - I feel tight.

1299
00:46:02,292 --> 00:46:03,990
Ji Hyo, are you the secret couple?

1300
00:46:03,991 --> 00:46:05,375
I swear, it's not me.

1301
00:46:05,522 --> 00:46:06,930
- I'm telling you, it isn't me! - Is it So Min?

1302
00:46:06,931 --> 00:46:08,530
Can we have another hint?

1303
00:46:08,531 --> 00:46:10,760
- This is really upsetting. - Seriously, it's not me.

1304
00:46:10,761 --> 00:46:12,030
- I swear. - This is confusing.

1305
00:46:12,031 --> 00:46:13,647
- Who is it? - It's really not me.

1306
00:46:14,301 --> 00:46:16,700
(One of them is acting.)

1307
00:46:16,701 --> 00:46:18,200
(That's the end of the race!)

1308
00:46:18,201 --> 00:46:20,510
- The second trial will begin now. - Let's go.

1309
00:46:20,511 --> 00:46:21,570
We'll talk at the trial.

1310
00:46:21,571 --> 00:46:22,941
We'll talk at the trial.

1311
00:46:22,942 --> 00:46:25,110
(It's their last chance to eliminate the secret couple.)

1312
00:46:25,111 --> 00:46:26,651
Today's race was...

1313
00:46:26,652 --> 00:46:28,180
the toughest of all time.

1314
00:46:28,181 --> 00:46:30,351
It's still confusing to the last minute.

1315
00:46:30,352 --> 00:46:32,199
We narrowed it down earlier,

1316
00:46:32,482 --> 00:46:34,191
but I still can't figure it out.

1317
00:46:34,192 --> 00:46:35,251
(The 2 suspects create a big-time confusion.)

1318
00:46:35,252 --> 00:46:37,691
I didn't even do anything today.

1319
00:46:37,692 --> 00:46:38,921
Seriously.

1320
00:46:38,922 --> 00:46:40,811
No, you did a good job.

1321
00:46:41,361 --> 00:46:42,800
- But guys, - Right.

1322
00:46:42,801 --> 00:46:43,901
let's think about it.

1323
00:46:43,902 --> 00:46:45,530
I don't want to suspect So Min,

1324
00:46:45,531 --> 00:46:46,871
since she's clearly upset about it.

1325
00:46:46,872 --> 00:46:48,852
- You always suspect me! - This will be the last time.

1326
00:46:48,931 --> 00:46:50,240
- Haha... - Last time.

1327
00:46:50,241 --> 00:46:51,570
- always suspect me. - We have no choice.

1328
00:46:51,571 --> 00:46:53,289
- Are you serious? - I don't know what your mission is,

1329
00:46:53,372 --> 00:46:57,047
but you went to Jae Young for a bite of the meal.

1330
00:46:57,312 --> 00:46:58,981
As if you really liked him.

1331
00:46:58,982 --> 00:47:00,711
I didn't ask for it.

1332
00:47:00,712 --> 00:47:02,851
- You did. - Jae Young gave it to me.

1333
00:47:02,852 --> 00:47:05,081
- Jae Young gave it to me. - You went to Jae Young,

1334
00:47:05,082 --> 00:47:08,021
and Kwang Soo stole that food.

1335
00:47:08,022 --> 00:47:10,260
When all that was happening and we were distracted,

1336
00:47:10,261 --> 00:47:11,791
it was Jae Young...

1337
00:47:11,792 --> 00:47:13,030
who gave you all that food.

1338
00:47:13,031 --> 00:47:14,930
- Jae Young gave her the food? - Yes, he did.

1339
00:47:14,931 --> 00:47:17,461
- Jae Young gave her the food? - No, it was Se Chan at first!

1340
00:47:17,462 --> 00:47:19,231
- I did give her at first. - It was Se Chan at first.

1341
00:47:19,232 --> 00:47:21,070
- Yes, he did. - He did give her the food.

1342
00:47:21,071 --> 00:47:23,364
As of today, I am officially dropping...

1343
00:47:23,642 --> 00:47:25,070
the title of the playgirl.

1344
00:47:25,071 --> 00:47:26,470
(She wants a new character.)

1345
00:47:26,471 --> 00:47:27,610
- Why? - Just like that?

1346
00:47:27,611 --> 00:47:28,711
I'd rather lose the title...

1347
00:47:28,712 --> 00:47:30,481
than be accused of something I'm not.

1348
00:47:30,482 --> 00:47:32,180
You wanted to be the playgirl.

1349
00:47:32,181 --> 00:47:33,323
- No one told you to be it. - Right.

1350
00:47:33,551 --> 00:47:36,621
It's already up to you to drop or take the title.

1351
00:47:36,622 --> 00:47:37,680
That's hilarious.

1352
00:47:37,681 --> 00:47:40,146
I have a question for So Min.

1353
00:47:40,192 --> 00:47:43,021
Why did I get the feeling that you were chasing...

1354
00:47:43,022 --> 00:47:44,691
me and Se Chan?

1355
00:47:44,692 --> 00:47:46,650
(Were you chasing me and Se Chan?)

1356
00:47:47,031 --> 00:47:48,461
(So Min did keep on following...)

1357
00:47:48,462 --> 00:47:53,731
(Jae Seok, the relationship virgin, and Se Chan who's obviously single.)

1358
00:47:53,732 --> 00:47:55,200
I was following Se Chan.

1359
00:47:55,201 --> 00:47:57,020
- I was chasing you. - Why were you chasing me?

1360
00:47:57,301 --> 00:47:58,401
- To get some hints! - Were you single?

1361
00:47:58,402 --> 00:48:00,271
Because I had no hint!

1362
00:48:00,272 --> 00:48:01,271
And no one...

1363
00:48:01,272 --> 00:48:02,880
See, at the beginning of the race,

1364
00:48:02,881 --> 00:48:05,641
Kwang Soo took my hint, so I couldn't see what it was.

1365
00:48:05,642 --> 00:48:07,268
We saw that.

1366
00:48:07,611 --> 00:48:09,780
Right, if there's the Relationship Virgin in here, hear me out.

1367
00:48:09,781 --> 00:48:11,651
I went to So Min,

1368
00:48:11,652 --> 00:48:14,421
and I talked to her, "I know you're upset."

1369
00:48:14,422 --> 00:48:16,691
"Are you really not the couple?" And she...

1370
00:48:16,692 --> 00:48:17,760
(I said, "I know you're upset.")

1371
00:48:17,761 --> 00:48:18,903
She cursed me out.

1372
00:48:19,661 --> 00:48:22,388
(That shows how upset she was.)

1373
00:48:22,792 --> 00:48:24,479
Hold on a minute, Ji Hyo did that too.

1374
00:48:24,732 --> 00:48:26,401
She cursed me out.

1375
00:48:26,402 --> 00:48:28,755
(Hold on a minute! Ji Hyo also cursed me out!)

1376
00:48:28,832 --> 00:48:30,371
And it was inappropriate for television.

1377
00:48:30,372 --> 00:48:33,846
I read her lips and it was clearly inappropriate for television.

1378
00:48:34,071 --> 00:48:36,141
- This is so confusing. - But you guys have to remember,

1379
00:48:36,142 --> 00:48:38,030
at our first trial,

1380
00:48:38,111 --> 00:48:41,212
Ji Hyo was the only one who was protecting Jae Young.

1381
00:48:41,281 --> 00:48:42,610
Let me just say this.

1382
00:48:42,611 --> 00:48:44,220
I'm really not the couple,

1383
00:48:44,221 --> 00:48:46,921
so if I were to step up there...

1384
00:48:46,922 --> 00:48:48,050
and I got eliminated, that would be fine with me.

1385
00:48:48,051 --> 00:48:49,450
That was a typical last resort.

1386
00:48:49,451 --> 00:48:51,521
- Jae Young said the same thing! - I'll talk.

1387
00:48:51,522 --> 00:48:53,030
- I'm pretty sure I heard it. - I'm serious.

1388
00:48:53,031 --> 00:48:54,130
- I'm innocent. - What did you hear?

1389
00:48:54,131 --> 00:48:55,231
Jae Young was far from me,

1390
00:48:55,232 --> 00:48:56,831
he didn't know I was there, and he said this.

1391
00:48:56,832 --> 00:48:57,860
- Jae Young said... - What did he say?

1392
00:48:57,861 --> 00:48:59,231
(Jae Young said something, not knowing Seok Jin was near.)

1393
00:48:59,232 --> 00:49:00,584
He said, "Where's Ji Hyo?"

1394
00:49:00,672 --> 00:49:02,489
It's exactly what he said.

1395
00:49:04,002 --> 00:49:07,941
(He was talking to himself during the race out of pressure.)

1396
00:49:07,942 --> 00:49:10,780
(Where's Ji Hyo?)

1397
00:49:10,781 --> 00:49:13,711
(Seok Jin was close enough to listen to Jae Young's...)

1398
00:49:13,712 --> 00:49:15,601
(suspicious monologue.)

1399
00:49:16,522 --> 00:49:17,851
Hear me out.

1400
00:49:17,852 --> 00:49:21,351
He could have said that to meet with me,

1401
00:49:21,352 --> 00:49:23,590
or he could have said it trying to eliminate me!

1402
00:49:23,591 --> 00:49:25,691
That's not right. Why would he say your name?

1403
00:49:25,692 --> 00:49:27,590
- This is so confusing. - It's okay.

1404
00:49:27,591 --> 00:49:28,874
The relationship virgin...

1405
00:49:29,192 --> 00:49:30,331
Wait a second!

1406
00:49:30,332 --> 00:49:32,061
(It's time to choose between So Min and Ji Hyo.)

1407
00:49:32,062 --> 00:49:33,271
This is...

1408
00:49:33,272 --> 00:49:34,570
- really confusing. - What if...

1409
00:49:34,571 --> 00:49:35,901
- So Min wasn't... - I can't choose.

1410
00:49:35,902 --> 00:49:38,063
- I don't know anymore. - Go with your first one in mind.

1411
00:49:38,341 --> 00:49:41,671
Isn't it weird that Jong Kook's team narrowly won the tug-of-war?

1412
00:49:41,672 --> 00:49:42,840
Okay, then I'll also...

1413
00:49:42,841 --> 00:49:44,441
If it's So Min, I'm going to freak out.

1414
00:49:44,442 --> 00:49:46,936
If Jo Hyo is the secret couple, it'll be really shocking.

1415
00:49:47,082 --> 00:49:48,311
We have the results.

1416
00:49:48,312 --> 00:49:49,380
- Really? - What's the score?

1417
00:49:49,381 --> 00:49:51,981
Once again, it was very close.

1418
00:49:51,982 --> 00:49:53,738
- Again? - It was 5 to 3.

1419
00:49:54,051 --> 00:49:55,550
So what? Someone's got to go anyway.

1420
00:49:55,551 --> 00:49:59,117
The last person to be judged is...

1421
00:49:59,141 --> 00:50:04,141
{\an8}<font color="#fcc89b">[VIU Ver] SBS E446 Running Man</font>
<font color="#ff80ff">"Find the Secret Couple"</font>
<font color="#ff5fa2">-♥ Ruo Xi ♥-</font>

1422
00:50:04,241 --> 00:50:07,384
The last person to be judged is...

1423
00:50:09,641 --> 00:50:11,540
Song Ji Hyo.

1424
00:50:11,541 --> 00:50:13,166
(It's Song Ji Hyo with 5 votes.)

1425
00:50:13,311 --> 00:50:14,680
(It really isn't me.)

1426
00:50:14,681 --> 00:50:15,749
It's not...

1427
00:50:15,750 --> 00:50:17,236
It's not me.

1428
00:50:17,451 --> 00:50:19,471
(Those who voted for So Min think it's not Ji Hyo.)

1429
00:50:19,790 --> 00:50:21,639
Should I be worried that she's confidently walking out there?

1430
00:50:21,690 --> 00:50:22,789
- For real? - It's not me!

1431
00:50:22,790 --> 00:50:24,360
- No, it's not me! - Are you sure?

1432
00:50:24,361 --> 00:50:26,760
- It isn't me. - It's not Ji Hyo, you guys!

1433
00:50:26,761 --> 00:50:29,487
- It is Ji Hyo. - No, it's So Min.

1434
00:50:29,900 --> 00:50:34,530
(If Ji Hyo is the secret couple, the singles take the final victory.)

1435
00:50:34,531 --> 00:50:36,570
- 1, 2. - 1, 2.

1436
00:50:36,571 --> 00:50:38,599
(Only one vote has changed her fate.)

1437
00:50:38,600 --> 00:50:39,599
- 3. - 3.

1438
00:50:39,600 --> 00:50:41,358
(Is Ji Hyo the secret couple?)

1439
00:50:43,681 --> 00:50:46,235
(Ji Hyo was not the secret couple!)

1440
00:50:47,511 --> 00:50:48,680
It's not Ji Hyo.

1441
00:50:48,681 --> 00:50:50,780
- I told you! - It wasn't Ji Hyo?

1442
00:50:50,781 --> 00:50:52,649
(I told you it wasn't Ji Hyo!)

1443
00:50:52,650 --> 00:50:54,610
- No! - I told you it wasn't me.

1444
00:50:55,350 --> 00:50:56,590
I told you it wasn't her.

1445
00:50:56,591 --> 00:50:58,320
(The female of the secret couple was Jeon So Min.)

1446
00:50:58,321 --> 00:50:59,559
(How did you guys like my acting?)

1447
00:50:59,560 --> 00:51:01,090
I told you guys!

1448
00:51:01,091 --> 00:51:03,010
She looked sincerely upset!

1449
00:51:03,301 --> 00:51:05,017
(In the morning of the shooting)

1450
00:51:05,730 --> 00:51:08,999
(The secret couple, Jae Young and So Min met for the first time.)

1451
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:10,470
Good. Thank you.

1452
00:51:10,471 --> 00:51:12,300
Should we go on dates starting right now?

1453
00:51:12,301 --> 00:51:14,470
(Should we go on dates starting right now?)

1454
00:51:14,471 --> 00:51:16,379
Don't we have something like...

1455
00:51:16,380 --> 00:51:18,110
- Missions? - Since we're a secret couple,

1456
00:51:18,111 --> 00:51:20,776
we'll need some sweet missions in public.

1457
00:51:20,911 --> 00:51:22,950
I'm sure So Min

1458
00:51:22,951 --> 00:51:24,579
will like these sweet missions.

1459
00:51:24,580 --> 00:51:25,631
(We've prepared some hidden sweet missions for So Min!)

1460
00:51:25,750 --> 00:51:27,810
- Are you okay with that? - Yes, I like them.

1461
00:51:28,850 --> 00:51:30,789
At every round, the secret couple needs to...

1462
00:51:30,790 --> 00:51:34,124
accomplish missions without being noticed by the single members.

1463
00:51:34,330 --> 00:51:37,087
Round 1, "Feed your partner."

1464
00:51:37,460 --> 00:51:38,559
- Just one person to another? - Just one?

1465
00:51:38,560 --> 00:51:40,722
- Either way, right? - Right.

1466
00:51:41,571 --> 00:51:43,560
(Round 1, choose your team.)

1467
00:51:43,801 --> 00:51:45,939
(So Min did not want Hee Jin to be on her team...)

1468
00:51:45,940 --> 00:51:48,365
(so that she can do the mission with Jae Young on the same team.)

1469
00:51:48,810 --> 00:51:50,325
(It's easier if we're on the same team!)

1470
00:51:50,681 --> 00:51:54,286
(Don't worry, So Min!)

1471
00:51:54,781 --> 00:51:56,209
(Jae Young pretends he's giving it to Ji Hyo,)

1472
00:51:56,210 --> 00:51:59,249
(and So Min pretends she's fooling around and steal it.)

1473
00:51:59,250 --> 00:52:01,919
(That was smooth.)

1474
00:52:01,920 --> 00:52:04,113
(They showed some teamwork to complete the 1st mission.)

1475
00:52:04,290 --> 00:52:05,919
If one person of the secret couple...

1476
00:52:05,920 --> 00:52:09,193
locks arm in arm with the relationship virgin,

1477
00:52:09,361 --> 00:52:11,860
the other partner will be able to...

1478
00:52:11,861 --> 00:52:13,099
eliminate the relationship virgin.

1479
00:52:13,100 --> 00:52:14,586
(The other partner of the couple may eliminate the relationship virgin.)

1480
00:52:14,971 --> 00:52:17,700
(Their strategy was to take out the most threatening enemy.)

1481
00:52:17,701 --> 00:52:21,105
(She approached Jong Kook naturally and locked arm in arm with him.)

1482
00:52:21,411 --> 00:52:22,870
You can now eliminate Jong Kook.

1483
00:52:22,871 --> 00:52:25,265
(I locked his arm. You can eliminate him.)

1484
00:52:25,781 --> 00:52:27,149
I'm sorry, Jong Kook.

1485
00:52:27,150 --> 00:52:30,453
(Jae Young succeeded in tearing out his name tag.)

1486
00:52:30,621 --> 00:52:32,849
(A beautiful couple's play takes out Jong Kook.)

1487
00:52:32,850 --> 00:52:34,264
(Yes!)

1488
00:52:34,991 --> 00:52:39,536
(And she finishes with perfect acting.)

1489
00:52:40,091 --> 00:52:42,360
The winners of today's race are...

1490
00:52:42,361 --> 00:52:43,999
So Min and Jae Young.

1491
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:45,899
- They did a fine job. - Thank you.

1492
00:52:45,900 --> 00:52:47,370
- You guys made it so confusing. - Here,

1493
00:52:47,371 --> 00:52:48,800
- take these. - It was such chaos.

1494
00:52:48,801 --> 00:52:50,140
- Wow, what is it? - Wow.

1495
00:52:50,141 --> 00:52:51,439
Thank you.

1496
00:52:51,440 --> 00:52:52,939
- It looks pretty. - It's pretty.

1497
00:52:52,940 --> 00:52:53,981
Thank you very much.

1498
00:52:54,770 --> 00:52:56,410
Lying makes me exhausted.

1499
00:52:56,411 --> 00:52:58,209
This was the most confusing of all time.

1500
00:52:58,210 --> 00:52:59,696
It sure was. It sure was.

1501
00:52:59,850 --> 00:53:01,450
I'm not talking to So Min for a while now.

1502
00:53:01,451 --> 00:53:02,780
- What do you want me to do? - I'm not going to talk to you.

1503
00:53:02,781 --> 00:53:05,245
They're going to say something if I don't try hard!

1504
00:53:06,281 --> 00:53:10,057
(It's really not my fault.)

1505
00:53:11,520 --> 00:53:14,490
(Just for So Min,)

1506
00:53:14,491 --> 00:53:17,429
(we've prepared her birthday special.)

1507
00:53:18,661 --> 00:53:19,984
Hello.

1508
00:53:20,031 --> 00:53:21,314
Hello.

1509
00:53:21,931 --> 00:53:22,981
Wait.

1510
00:53:24,170 --> 00:53:26,190
I just got here.

1511
00:53:26,940 --> 00:53:28,587
What is all this?

1512
00:53:29,371 --> 00:53:31,199
This place looks beautiful.

1513
00:53:32,241 --> 00:53:35,110
Will you tell me why I'm here alone?

1514
00:53:35,111 --> 00:53:38,019
Today is a special episode for your birthday.

1515
00:53:38,020 --> 00:53:39,579
(Today is a special episode for your birthday.)

1516
00:53:39,580 --> 00:53:41,249
- It's my birthday! - It is.

1517
00:53:41,250 --> 00:53:42,320
(Today is So Min's birthday.)

1518
00:53:42,321 --> 00:53:43,990
The title of the special is...

1519
00:53:43,991 --> 00:53:45,890
a thrilling real variety,

1520
00:53:45,891 --> 00:53:48,082
"Sulliver's Love Race".

1521
00:53:48,460 --> 00:53:51,059
Sulliver's race?

1522
00:53:51,060 --> 00:53:52,629
We've picked...

1523
00:53:52,630 --> 00:53:55,129
some of your partners from TV series.

1524
00:53:55,130 --> 00:53:57,340
To check how you would match them in real life,

1525
00:53:57,341 --> 00:53:59,118
you will be going on dates.

1526
00:53:59,301 --> 00:54:00,570
All of them are coming?

1527
00:54:00,571 --> 00:54:01,910
Who are you expecting?

1528
00:54:01,911 --> 00:54:04,539
(Who would be her matching counterpart?)

1529
00:54:04,540 --> 00:54:06,309
There's too many of them.

1530
00:54:06,310 --> 00:54:07,593
Kim Ji Suk.

1531
00:54:08,250 --> 00:54:13,977
Also, I worked with Oh Chang Seok and Ha Seok Jin before.

1532
00:54:14,551 --> 00:54:17,085
And long before them, there's Song Won Geun.

1533
00:54:17,761 --> 00:54:19,320
Who else... There's too many.

1534
00:54:19,321 --> 00:54:21,930
I'm fine with anyone as long as it's not Sang Yeob.

1535
00:54:21,931 --> 00:54:23,399
(As long as it's not Sang Yeob.)

1536
00:54:23,400 --> 00:54:24,530
(Why do you not like me, So Min?)

1537
00:54:24,531 --> 00:54:26,329
And if by chance,

1538
00:54:26,330 --> 00:54:28,070
Sang Yeob walks through that door,

1539
00:54:28,071 --> 00:54:30,565
I'm going home straight away.

1540
00:54:31,170 --> 00:54:33,534
He's been on this show too many times.

1541
00:54:34,011 --> 00:54:36,910
(Just 3 weeks ago,)

1542
00:54:36,911 --> 00:54:39,133
(they made it very clear, the two were too close like family.)

1543
00:54:39,681 --> 00:54:41,780
We referred to your romance dreams...

1544
00:54:41,781 --> 00:54:45,154
- to plan your date for today. - Yes.

1545
00:54:45,321 --> 00:54:46,890
All expenses will be paid...

1546
00:54:46,891 --> 00:54:49,959
by whoever you choose among the members of Running Man.

1547
00:54:49,960 --> 00:54:51,590
(Any member she wants)

1548
00:54:51,591 --> 00:54:53,890
It will be charged to that member.

1549
00:54:53,891 --> 00:54:55,229
(The chosen member has to pay for everything.)

1550
00:54:55,230 --> 00:54:57,660
(This is such awesome production crew and a show.)

1551
00:54:57,661 --> 00:54:59,399
I love it.

1552
00:54:59,400 --> 00:55:01,530
What's more important is...

1553
00:55:01,531 --> 00:55:04,499
whether I'd be able to enjoy the date without the guys.

1554
00:55:04,500 --> 00:55:05,885
Since you brought it up,

1555
00:55:05,940 --> 00:55:08,209
the members will be hunting you...

1556
00:55:08,210 --> 00:55:11,010
to stop you from charging them.

1557
00:55:11,011 --> 00:55:14,309
(The chase to stop the charge begins now.)

1558
00:55:14,310 --> 00:55:17,419
If you get caught, you will have to pay for everything...

1559
00:55:17,420 --> 00:55:19,340
that you have used that day.

1560
00:55:19,520 --> 00:55:21,019
(I knew you would do that.)

1561
00:55:21,020 --> 00:55:23,019
- Okay, got it. - If you get caught,

1562
00:55:23,020 --> 00:55:24,820
there will also be punishments.

1563
00:55:24,821 --> 00:55:26,860
And your date will be terminated.

1564
00:55:26,861 --> 00:55:28,289
(If she gets caught, her date is terminated.)

1565
00:55:28,290 --> 00:55:29,629
It's over when I get caught?

1566
00:55:29,630 --> 00:55:31,246
I go home after they catch me?

1567
00:55:31,431 --> 00:55:32,815
Okay.

1568
00:55:33,600 --> 00:55:36,459
That sounds like a tough one. I shouldn't get caught.

1569
00:55:37,871 --> 00:55:38,939
Hello.

1570
00:55:38,940 --> 00:55:40,340
- Hello. - Hello.

1571
00:55:40,341 --> 00:55:41,970
- Hello! - Hello.

1572
00:55:41,971 --> 00:55:44,840
- It's still cold in Paju. - It is.

1573
00:55:44,841 --> 00:55:46,910
- It is cold. - Kwang Soo got a haircut!

1574
00:55:46,911 --> 00:55:48,110
(Kwang Soo got a haircut!)

1575
00:55:48,111 --> 00:55:49,910
I did get a haircut.

1576
00:55:49,911 --> 00:55:51,680
Why did you do it? You look bad.

1577
00:55:51,681 --> 00:55:53,950
- Why did you... - You shouldn't have cut it.

1578
00:55:53,951 --> 00:55:56,019
Why don't we show the viewers some consistency, Kwang Soo?

1579
00:55:56,020 --> 00:55:57,519
- There's nothing back there. - I can't even grab his hair.

1580
00:55:57,520 --> 00:55:59,289
You just look naked.

1581
00:55:59,290 --> 00:56:00,430
- Kwang Soo. - Yes?

1582
00:56:00,431 --> 00:56:02,129
Go and get hair extensions.

1583
00:56:02,130 --> 00:56:03,700
Why would I do that?

1584
00:56:03,701 --> 00:56:04,760
- It's over, I already cut it. - The viewers are going to be...

1585
00:56:04,761 --> 00:56:06,649
uncomfortable looking at you.

1586
00:56:06,730 --> 00:56:08,430
- You look young, though. - He does.

1587
00:56:08,431 --> 00:56:10,219
Maybe 41 years old.

1588
00:56:10,241 --> 00:56:11,399
41 years old?

1589
00:56:11,400 --> 00:56:12,899
He said 41.

1590
00:56:12,900 --> 00:56:14,809
- That really upsets me. - He's in his mid-30s.

1591
00:56:14,810 --> 00:56:16,570
Where is So Min?

1592
00:56:16,571 --> 00:56:17,840
- Where did she go? - Where is she?

1593
00:56:17,841 --> 00:56:19,900
- I don't see her. - She's on something, again.

1594
00:56:19,911 --> 00:56:23,209
What we record here today will be aired on...

1595
00:56:23,210 --> 00:56:25,270
- April 7th. - That's her birthday!

1596
00:56:25,420 --> 00:56:27,220
- I see. - Oh, really?

1597
00:56:27,221 --> 00:56:28,320
- Okay. - So what?

1598
00:56:28,321 --> 00:56:30,490
For So Min's birthday...

1599
00:56:30,491 --> 00:56:33,019
Wait. It's her birthday special?

1600
00:56:33,020 --> 00:56:35,030
Yes, it's So Min's birthday special.

1601
00:56:35,031 --> 00:56:37,959
Are we buying her presents for her birthday?

1602
00:56:37,960 --> 00:56:39,829
- Please, she gets too picky. - She does.

1603
00:56:39,830 --> 00:56:41,329
- She really can. - Right.

1604
00:56:41,330 --> 00:56:43,017
She can get real picky.

1605
00:56:43,031 --> 00:56:45,300
So Min's birthday special for today is...

1606
00:56:45,301 --> 00:56:47,070
get thrilled or throw away,

1607
00:56:47,071 --> 00:56:49,039
Sulliver's Love Race.

1608
00:56:49,040 --> 00:56:50,222
Sulliver?

1609
00:56:50,911 --> 00:56:52,324
Isn't it Gulliver?

1610
00:56:52,611 --> 00:56:54,209
- Get thrilled or throw away? - Sulliver.

1611
00:56:54,210 --> 00:56:56,503
It's been 15 years since I last felt thrilled.

1612
00:56:56,781 --> 00:56:58,419
- You're lying. - You're lying.

1613
00:56:58,420 --> 00:57:00,390
- I don't ever get thrilled. - Stop lying.

1614
00:57:00,391 --> 00:57:02,320
You were thrilled when Yang Jung A showed up here.

1615
00:57:02,321 --> 00:57:04,946
(You were thrilled when Yang Jung A showed up here.)

1616
00:57:05,391 --> 00:57:07,248
- You did! - Be quiet.

1617
00:57:07,730 --> 00:57:08,860
- Why are you... - Shut it!

1618
00:57:08,861 --> 00:57:11,030
- keep lying? - Shut it!

1619
00:57:11,031 --> 00:57:12,930
- I said I don't get thrilled... - Why are you...

1620
00:57:12,931 --> 00:57:14,729
under any circumstances.

1621
00:57:14,730 --> 00:57:16,300
- Stop lying! - I don't get thrilled.

1622
00:57:16,301 --> 00:57:18,725
I won't just share what I know.

1623
00:57:18,971 --> 00:57:20,240
At this moment,

1624
00:57:20,241 --> 00:57:22,209
So Min is already on a date...

1625
00:57:22,210 --> 00:57:24,209
as she wishes.

1626
00:57:24,210 --> 00:57:26,910
- She's on a date? - Right now?

1627
00:57:26,911 --> 00:57:28,309
(Right now?)

1628
00:57:28,310 --> 00:57:30,220
- She's on a date? - This is madness.

1629
00:57:30,221 --> 00:57:32,419
- That sounds like So Min for sure. - Are we setting up...

1630
00:57:32,420 --> 00:57:33,789
So Min with other guys?

1631
00:57:33,790 --> 00:57:36,220
So Min's back of the ear will be bleeding by tomorrow.

1632
00:57:36,221 --> 00:57:37,860
She's going to get hurt.

1633
00:57:37,861 --> 00:57:40,129
It's going to leave a mark.

1634
00:57:40,130 --> 00:57:42,555
She does this too much in front of guys she likes.

1635
00:57:42,661 --> 00:57:44,852
- She's going to get an infection. - Right.

1636
00:57:45,230 --> 00:57:47,970
- I think she's already hurt. - She does it too much.

1637
00:57:47,971 --> 00:57:49,629
Why don't you two get ready?

1638
00:57:49,630 --> 00:57:51,169
(Jong Kook and Ji Hyo)

1639
00:57:51,170 --> 00:57:53,870
- Get ready for what? - Get ready for the dating race.

1640
00:57:53,871 --> 00:57:55,510
(He's flustered!)

1641
00:57:55,511 --> 00:57:57,309
- Get ready for what? - Well, she's ready.

1642
00:57:57,310 --> 00:57:58,510
- Stop it. - She wants to do it.

1643
00:57:58,511 --> 00:57:59,894
She's drawing her hair back.

1644
00:58:00,040 --> 00:58:02,479
- Ji Hyo, get ready. - Stop it.

1645
00:58:02,480 --> 00:58:03,579
- Get ready for your love race. - Get ready.

1646
00:58:03,580 --> 00:58:04,579
He's going to Los Angeles.

1647
00:58:04,580 --> 00:58:06,120
But the thing is,

1648
00:58:06,121 --> 00:58:08,474
everything she does on her date...

1649
00:58:08,491 --> 00:58:11,120
will be charged to the person that...

1650
00:58:11,121 --> 00:58:12,419
So Min chose among you guys.

1651
00:58:12,420 --> 00:58:13,629
What? Why?

1652
00:58:13,630 --> 00:58:15,590
(The member chosen by So Min will be paying for everything.)

1653
00:58:15,591 --> 00:58:17,229
- My goodness. - That's not fair!

1654
00:58:17,230 --> 00:58:19,160
Why do we have to pay for it? She's the one on a date!

1655
00:58:19,161 --> 00:58:21,050
- Right. - What did we do wrong?

1656
00:58:21,130 --> 00:58:23,454
Before her date is over,

1657
00:58:23,600 --> 00:58:25,840
you have to find her and take out her name tag.

1658
00:58:25,841 --> 00:58:28,740
(That way, they don't have to pay.)

1659
00:58:28,741 --> 00:58:30,379
- Then it will be charged to her. - Yes!

1660
00:58:30,380 --> 00:58:31,939
- Okay, okay. - We need to take out her name tag.

1661
00:58:31,940 --> 00:58:34,479
Hold on, if we don't take out her name tag,

1662
00:58:34,480 --> 00:58:36,479
we pay for it and get punished?

1663
00:58:36,480 --> 00:58:38,220
She must be using tons of money.

1664
00:58:38,221 --> 00:58:39,519
We can't have that.

1665
00:58:39,520 --> 00:58:41,789
Clues about her dating course and location...

1666
00:58:41,790 --> 00:58:45,390
will be given when you complete certain missions.

1667
00:58:45,391 --> 00:58:47,349
- Okay. - We need clues.

1668
00:58:47,790 --> 00:58:49,129
Your first hint...

1669
00:58:49,130 --> 00:58:51,430
- is waiting inside the building. - Let's go.

1670
00:58:51,431 --> 00:58:53,420
Let's get her, guys.

1671
00:58:53,531 --> 00:58:54,814
Okay, good.

1672
00:58:55,301 --> 00:58:57,240
(7 of them enters the building.)

1673
00:58:57,241 --> 00:59:00,169
I mean, she's the one on a date,

1674
00:59:00,170 --> 00:59:02,309
- and we have to pay for it? - It's our money.

1675
00:59:02,310 --> 00:59:03,879
That's what I mean.

1676
00:59:03,880 --> 00:59:04,879
(They're entering the building.)

1677
00:59:04,880 --> 00:59:05,879
- What is this? - What is it?

1678
00:59:05,880 --> 00:59:08,001
- Are they the clues? - I think they are.

1679
00:59:08,011 --> 00:59:09,809
- Wait... - This is the escape room.

1680
00:59:09,810 --> 00:59:12,220
Another room escape? Sounds great!

1681
00:59:12,221 --> 00:59:15,019
- It's escaping the room? - Right, that's it!

1682
00:59:15,420 --> 00:59:16,502
What are these?

1683
00:59:16,551 --> 00:59:17,760
What's this?

1684
00:59:17,761 --> 00:59:21,195
(There are suspicious objects all around the room.)

1685
00:59:22,891 --> 00:59:25,627
(What is this place?)

1686
00:59:25,861 --> 00:59:27,011
What is it?

1687
00:59:27,071 --> 00:59:30,539
It says we can track her down when we escape from this room.

1688
00:59:30,540 --> 00:59:34,379
(You may track down So Min only when you escape from this room.)

1689
00:59:35,111 --> 00:59:39,181
(The main gate is locked. Where is So Min?)

1690
00:59:41,380 --> 00:59:43,010
Your first destination is...

1691
00:59:43,011 --> 00:59:45,071
a course meal restaurant.

1692
00:59:45,520 --> 00:59:47,390
That sounds great. In a fancy restaurant...

1693
00:59:47,391 --> 00:59:49,550
eating delicious course meal together with candles on.

1694
00:59:49,551 --> 00:59:51,339
That's why here are these candles.

1695
00:59:51,861 --> 00:59:54,618
(She's drawing her hair back.)

1696
00:59:55,330 --> 01:00:00,583
(She's waiting for the one to enjoy this date with.)

1697
01:00:00,707 --> 01:00:04,007
<font color="#fcc89b">[VIU Ver] SBS E446 Running Man</font>
<font color="#ff80ff">"Sulliver's Love Race"</font>
<font color="#ff5fa2">-♥ Ruo Xi ♥-</font>

1698
01:00:04,170 --> 01:00:07,809
(He's here!)

1699
01:00:07,810 --> 01:00:09,209
Ji Suk!

1700
01:00:09,210 --> 01:00:10,379
(Ji Suk!)

1701
01:00:10,380 --> 01:00:14,148
(She greets him while clapping.)

1702
01:00:14,850 --> 01:00:17,144
(It's Kim Ji Suk, the top actor in the heart of a girl in an island)

1703
01:00:17,650 --> 01:00:21,050
(She picked him as someone who she was interested in.)

1704
01:00:21,051 --> 01:00:24,999
(They looked very good together in the TV series.)

1705
01:00:25,221 --> 01:00:27,110
So Min!

1706
01:00:27,730 --> 01:00:30,059
(It's been so long, Ji Suk.)

1707
01:00:30,060 --> 01:00:32,059
- How have you been? - So good to see you!

1708
01:00:32,060 --> 01:00:34,300
(They're hugging it out.)

1709
01:00:34,301 --> 01:00:35,329
How have you been?

1710
01:00:35,330 --> 01:00:38,439
(They meet after three months.)

1711
01:00:38,440 --> 01:00:40,510
We've finally met again!

1712
01:00:40,511 --> 01:00:41,809
Thank you.

1713
01:00:41,810 --> 01:00:43,840
(Thank you for inviting Ji Suk.)

1714
01:00:43,841 --> 01:00:45,579
Thank you very much. Ji Suk.

1715
01:00:45,580 --> 01:00:48,149
- Happy birthday. - Thank you, did you get up early?

1716
01:00:48,150 --> 01:00:49,929
- I did. - Was it far to get here?

1717
01:00:50,380 --> 01:00:51,749
You look more beautiful than the last time I saw you.

1718
01:00:51,750 --> 01:00:52,919
(You look more beautiful than the last time I saw you.)

1719
01:00:52,920 --> 01:00:54,019
(Her heart flutters.)

1720
01:00:54,020 --> 01:00:56,415
- Really? Today... - I mean...

1721
01:00:56,591 --> 01:00:57,689
- Do I look... - What?

1722
01:00:57,690 --> 01:00:58,789
Loot at me.

1723
01:00:58,790 --> 01:00:59,872
What?

1724
01:01:01,330 --> 01:01:04,259
(She's showing off her fancy outfit.)

1725
01:01:04,701 --> 01:01:06,953
- You look pretty. - Do I look pretty?

1726
01:01:07,130 --> 01:01:09,030
- And... - Did you dye your hair?

1727
01:01:09,031 --> 01:01:12,434
Yes, a little bit. It's weird seeing you...

1728
01:01:13,141 --> 01:01:15,470
in a place like this.

1729
01:01:15,471 --> 01:01:16,640
Is this awkward meeting me here?

1730
01:01:16,641 --> 01:01:17,953
I'm not...

1731
01:01:18,511 --> 01:01:19,939
(She looks shy.)

1732
01:01:19,940 --> 01:01:21,749
Do you feel awkward with me?

1733
01:01:21,750 --> 01:01:23,879
It's not that, I heard that...

1734
01:01:23,880 --> 01:01:26,749
I have a date tonight,

1735
01:01:26,750 --> 01:01:29,249
- I am here on a date. - and I'm embarrassed a bit.

1736
01:01:29,250 --> 01:01:30,860
(Her heart flutters again.)

1737
01:01:30,861 --> 01:01:33,019
- You're embarrassed? - Yes. Well...

1738
01:01:33,020 --> 01:01:35,760
I kept asking them that I wanted to be here.

1739
01:01:35,761 --> 01:01:38,791
- You did? - Yes. And it seems like...

1740
01:01:39,801 --> 01:01:41,430
you're saying random stuff about us.

1741
01:01:41,431 --> 01:01:42,599
I did not.

1742
01:01:42,600 --> 01:01:43,899
(Ji Suk wanted to ask So Min.)

1743
01:01:43,900 --> 01:01:45,140
(She panics out.)

1744
01:01:45,141 --> 01:01:46,140
I did not.

1745
01:01:46,141 --> 01:01:47,554
Why am I number 2?

1746
01:01:47,641 --> 01:01:49,769
When did I say that? I never said that.

1747
01:01:49,770 --> 01:01:52,410
You said Gong Myoung was number 1 and me, number 2.

1748
01:01:52,411 --> 01:01:53,763
(Gong Myoung is your number 1 and I'm your number 2?)

1749
01:01:54,411 --> 01:01:59,673
(She chose Gong Myoung last time without hesitating.)

1750
01:02:00,020 --> 01:02:02,313
- I'm just so embarrassed. - Do you like him?

1751
01:02:02,491 --> 01:02:03,760
Do you think he's good-looking?

1752
01:02:03,761 --> 01:02:07,490
That's not it, I was being polite to a guest of our show.

1753
01:02:07,491 --> 01:02:09,712
Well, I'm here. So change it.

1754
01:02:11,130 --> 01:02:12,160
Look at the camera.

1755
01:02:12,161 --> 01:02:13,160
(Look at the camera and say it.)

1756
01:02:13,161 --> 01:02:16,070
What do you want me to say? My ideal type is...

1757
01:02:16,071 --> 01:02:18,169
Is it Gong Myoung or Kim Ji Suk?

1758
01:02:18,170 --> 01:02:20,709
(Gong Myoung or Kim Ji Suk?)

1759
01:02:20,710 --> 01:02:22,870
It was actually Ji Suk.

1760
01:02:22,871 --> 01:02:24,840
(I'm sorry, Gong Myoung.)

1761
01:02:24,841 --> 01:02:27,033
(He seems satisfied.)

1762
01:02:27,781 --> 01:02:30,050
(I'll change it back when you come here.)

1763
01:02:30,051 --> 01:02:33,519
Why is it so awkward now?

1764
01:02:33,520 --> 01:02:35,720
I couldn't sleep well because I was too excited.

1765
01:02:35,721 --> 01:02:38,923
About all this dating stuff.

1766
01:02:39,621 --> 01:02:40,660
Stuff like this...

1767
01:02:40,661 --> 01:02:42,689
Can you look at me when you talk to me?

1768
01:02:42,690 --> 01:02:44,030
(Ji Suk is sad.)

1769
01:02:44,031 --> 01:02:45,575
No, I mean...

1770
01:02:45,661 --> 01:02:48,070
Here's the thing.

1771
01:02:48,071 --> 01:02:49,889
Ever since I joined Running Man,

1772
01:02:50,071 --> 01:02:52,091
I've never had such a sweet moment before.

1773
01:02:52,641 --> 01:02:57,731
(She went under a lot of physical activities and punishments.)

1774
01:02:58,141 --> 01:02:59,410
(She can't even look at him in the eyes.)

1775
01:02:59,411 --> 01:03:01,749
So, how about you?

1776
01:03:01,750 --> 01:03:04,749
We were filming at that island for six months.

1777
01:03:04,750 --> 01:03:05,749
Right.

1778
01:03:05,750 --> 01:03:08,019
So when I was coming here, I felt a little weird.

1779
01:03:08,020 --> 01:03:09,320
It felt different.

1780
01:03:09,321 --> 01:03:10,907
What kind of feeling?

1781
01:03:11,520 --> 01:03:14,622
It was different from meeting a character on a set.

1782
01:03:14,891 --> 01:03:16,243
Different in what way?

1783
01:03:17,130 --> 01:03:19,959
I got a little bit nervous...

1784
01:03:20,230 --> 01:03:23,530
when I heard that it was going to be a date.

1785
01:03:23,531 --> 01:03:26,140
I'm excited, are you not excited?

1786
01:03:26,141 --> 01:03:28,161
Well, I saw everything you did...

1787
01:03:28,411 --> 01:03:29,740
on television.

1788
01:03:29,741 --> 01:03:31,579
- That's not... - And on the news.

1789
01:03:31,580 --> 01:03:33,780
(I wanted romance with Ji Suk, but that didn't happen.)

1790
01:03:33,781 --> 01:03:35,579
- That's not true. - Why did you...

1791
01:03:35,580 --> 01:03:37,519
- say all that? - I was just...

1792
01:03:37,520 --> 01:03:39,780
embarrassed to call you.

1793
01:03:39,781 --> 01:03:41,950
Was I that focused on acting?

1794
01:03:41,951 --> 01:03:44,749
No, you weren't! Why don't we talk about it now?

1795
01:03:45,161 --> 01:03:46,908
- Yes, go ahead. - Have you ever...

1796
01:03:47,431 --> 01:03:49,860
had feelings for me while shooting?

1797
01:03:49,861 --> 01:03:51,043
(Now So Min asks Ji Suk.)

1798
01:03:52,330 --> 01:03:57,800
(They spent 6 months as a loving couple.)

1799
01:03:57,801 --> 01:04:00,240
(Has he ever had feelings for her?)

1800
01:04:00,241 --> 01:04:03,209
My heart did flutter.

1801
01:04:03,210 --> 01:04:04,510
(Ji Suk's heart fluttered.)

1802
01:04:04,511 --> 01:04:06,209
(So Min's heart flutters for the third time.)

1803
01:04:06,210 --> 01:04:07,765
Several times.

1804
01:04:07,980 --> 01:04:09,627
- Several times? - Yes.

1805
01:04:09,650 --> 01:04:11,943
Things you did without thinking...

1806
01:04:12,621 --> 01:04:15,090
made my heart flutter.

1807
01:04:15,091 --> 01:04:17,384
However, you went away as if nothing happened.

1808
01:04:19,321 --> 01:04:20,471
Was I the first one who acted like that on a set?

1809
01:04:20,591 --> 01:04:21,874
Yes, you were.

1810
01:04:23,161 --> 01:04:24,760
- Thank you. - Thank you.

1811
01:04:24,761 --> 01:04:26,930
We're having a meal while being on a date.

1812
01:04:26,931 --> 01:04:28,800
- This is a great place. - Isn't it amazing?

1813
01:04:28,801 --> 01:04:30,345
(It's warm and soft soup to calm them down.)

1814
01:04:30,431 --> 01:04:32,099
(How are the other members doing...)

1815
01:04:32,100 --> 01:04:33,818
(while they're on a dream date?)

1816
01:04:35,310 --> 01:04:38,110
(They start to search for hints to escape from the room.)

1817
01:04:38,111 --> 01:04:40,535
(They must escape to chase after So Min.)

1818
01:04:41,411 --> 01:04:43,431
- Hey, what's this? - What's this?

1819
01:04:43,951 --> 01:04:46,180
- What is it? - It's a drawing machine.

1820
01:04:46,181 --> 01:04:47,590
(They find a small drawing machine.)

1821
01:04:47,591 --> 01:04:48,661
A drawing machine?

1822
01:04:48,920 --> 01:04:52,051
(There are a lot of things inside.)

1823
01:04:52,761 --> 01:04:56,932
(Mysterious pieces of paper are inside clear capsules.)

1824
01:04:57,330 --> 01:04:58,559
If we escape...

1825
01:04:58,560 --> 01:05:00,260
from this place early, we can catch her right away.

1826
01:05:00,261 --> 01:05:02,070
- This is it. - It's a safe.

1827
01:05:02,071 --> 01:05:03,169
We must catch So Min.

1828
01:05:03,170 --> 01:05:04,716
- We need to open the safe. - We do.

1829
01:05:05,400 --> 01:05:09,047
(There's an alphabet password on the safe.)

1830
01:05:09,170 --> 01:05:10,209
- We need to open the safe. - Do we?

1831
01:05:10,210 --> 01:05:12,029
So Min is on a date while we're here...

1832
01:05:12,281 --> 01:05:14,169
Is there something inside?

1833
01:05:14,380 --> 01:05:15,967
Why are we in here?

1834
01:05:16,911 --> 01:05:18,092
Jong Kook.

1835
01:05:18,221 --> 01:05:20,402
- These cars... - There must be a hint here.

1836
01:05:21,750 --> 01:05:23,236
What about the TV? Why is there a TV?

1837
01:05:24,091 --> 01:05:25,474
What about the TV? Why is there a TV?

1838
01:05:25,690 --> 01:05:26,700
Where's the remote control?

1839
01:05:27,491 --> 01:05:28,629
I should find the remote control.

1840
01:05:28,630 --> 01:05:29,660
(So Min and Ji Suk are on TV.)

1841
01:05:29,661 --> 01:05:30,671
Is this the remote control?

1842
01:05:31,261 --> 01:05:32,530
- What's this? - What?

1843
01:05:32,531 --> 01:05:35,070
(So Min is on TV.)

1844
01:05:35,071 --> 01:05:38,807
- It's So Min. - She's on a date.

1845
01:05:38,871 --> 01:05:39,982
Who is it? It's Ji Suk.

1846
01:05:40,100 --> 01:05:42,309
- It's Ji Suk. - It's Ji Suk indeed.

1847
01:05:42,310 --> 01:05:43,523
Look at So Min.

1848
01:05:43,940 --> 01:05:45,180
Are they on a date right now?

1849
01:05:45,181 --> 01:05:47,059
This is unbelievable.

1850
01:05:47,380 --> 01:05:49,834
- Wait, Jae Seok. - What?

1851
01:05:50,080 --> 01:05:51,767
Are they eating in there?

1852
01:05:51,781 --> 01:05:52,950
Right now?

1853
01:05:52,951 --> 01:05:55,090
They're eating upstairs.

1854
01:05:55,091 --> 01:05:56,909
- I smell food. - They're in this building.

1855
01:05:56,951 --> 01:05:58,274
Do you smell food?

1856
01:05:58,560 --> 01:05:59,760
- I do. - Yes.

1857
01:05:59,761 --> 01:06:01,448
- It smells like food. - It smells like garlic bread.

1858
01:06:01,491 --> 01:06:02,760
- It smells like food. - They're eating here.

1859
01:06:02,761 --> 01:06:05,123
- I smell bread. - Find them now no matter what.

1860
01:06:05,330 --> 01:06:06,700
We must get out of here.

1861
01:06:06,701 --> 01:06:08,518
(So Min and Ji Suk are having a date on the second floor.)

1862
01:06:09,130 --> 01:06:10,818
They're in here.

1863
01:06:10,900 --> 01:06:12,254
They're nearby.

1864
01:06:12,471 --> 01:06:14,240
(Once they leave this room, the upstairs is very close.)

1865
01:06:14,241 --> 01:06:16,010
(Once you escape from this room, you can catch So Min.)

1866
01:06:16,011 --> 01:06:17,354
There must be a hint.

1867
01:06:18,781 --> 01:06:21,149
(While they realize the truth on the first floor,)

1868
01:06:21,150 --> 01:06:23,809
(So Min has no idea on the second floor.)

1869
01:06:23,810 --> 01:06:25,134
What have you been doing?

1870
01:06:25,580 --> 01:06:26,631
- Me? - Yes.

1871
01:06:26,750 --> 01:06:29,050
I gained some weight and worked out.

1872
01:06:29,051 --> 01:06:30,201
Did you work out a lot?

1873
01:06:30,290 --> 01:06:32,419
Yes, I worked out so much...

1874
01:06:32,420 --> 01:06:34,076
while shooting that drama.

1875
01:06:34,290 --> 01:06:35,442
At that time,

1876
01:06:36,290 --> 01:06:37,845
I didn't know what was going on.

1877
01:06:37,931 --> 01:06:40,526
When there was no running water at your lodging,

1878
01:06:41,701 --> 01:06:44,140
- it was our first shoot. - Wait.

1879
01:06:44,141 --> 01:06:46,099
(So Min had no choice but go to Ji Suk's lodging.)

1880
01:06:46,100 --> 01:06:47,686
I was taking a shower early in the morning.

1881
01:06:47,710 --> 01:06:49,529
You told me to come out with clothes on.

1882
01:06:49,841 --> 01:06:51,659
I was afraid that you'd come out undressed.

1883
01:06:51,741 --> 01:06:54,149
I thought you were my stylist.

1884
01:06:54,150 --> 01:06:55,950
When I came out, you were standing in front of me.

1885
01:06:55,951 --> 01:06:58,680
(You were standing in front of me after I took a quick shower.)

1886
01:06:58,681 --> 01:07:01,347
You were wearing pajamas and holding a towel.

1887
01:07:01,951 --> 01:07:03,607
I was startled then.

1888
01:07:03,621 --> 01:07:05,005
Then this is what you said.

1889
01:07:05,091 --> 01:07:07,530
"When you leave, be careful."

1890
01:07:07,531 --> 01:07:10,217
"If anyone sees you, we'll be misunderstood."

1891
01:07:11,161 --> 01:07:12,299
That's right.

1892
01:07:12,300 --> 01:07:13,846
(That's what happened.)

1893
01:07:15,631 --> 01:07:17,722
You have something on you.

1894
01:07:17,800 --> 01:07:19,285
- Where? - I have nothing to wipe with.

1895
01:07:20,041 --> 01:07:21,253
There are no napkins.

1896
01:07:21,770 --> 01:07:23,040
(Here's some napkin.)

1897
01:07:23,041 --> 01:07:24,696
(She sticks out her face.)

1898
01:07:25,510 --> 01:07:28,278
(Can you wipe it off for me?)

1899
01:07:28,751 --> 01:07:31,179
(What did you say? What's wrong with her?)

1900
01:07:31,180 --> 01:07:35,029
(So Min has a secret that she can't tell.)

1901
01:07:35,650 --> 01:07:38,822
While being on a date,

1902
01:07:39,090 --> 01:07:42,090
all I do is make the other members pay for the date and run away.

1903
01:07:42,090 --> 01:07:44,010
However...

1904
01:07:44,031 --> 01:07:45,647
during the course meal,

1905
01:07:45,760 --> 01:07:48,630
you must make your date say and do...

1906
01:07:48,631 --> 01:07:50,330
five specific things.

1907
01:07:50,331 --> 01:07:52,018
Then you can move on to the next.

1908
01:07:52,640 --> 01:07:54,639
(I knew it.)

1909
01:07:54,640 --> 01:07:56,388
This isn't an easy date.

1910
01:07:56,810 --> 01:07:59,235
What are the five things?

1911
01:07:59,480 --> 01:08:01,500
He must say the word "pretty"...

1912
01:08:01,581 --> 01:08:03,368
and that his heart fluttered.

1913
01:08:03,411 --> 01:08:05,471
He must also say that he's jealous.

1914
01:08:05,550 --> 01:08:07,610
He has to cut the steak for you...

1915
01:08:07,751 --> 01:08:09,871
and wipe off the food from your mouth.

1916
01:08:10,421 --> 01:08:13,759
(How do I make him do that?)

1917
01:08:13,760 --> 01:08:16,290
Isn't that too harsh?

1918
01:08:16,291 --> 01:08:18,654
Unless he's an extremely sweet man...

1919
01:08:19,131 --> 01:08:23,799
(An extremely sweet man has appeared in front of So Min.)

1920
01:08:23,800 --> 01:08:24,951
(You now look prettier than before.)

1921
01:08:25,201 --> 01:08:28,271
(She gains 1 as soon as he arrives.)

1922
01:08:28,940 --> 01:08:30,540
(She tries to lead him on...)

1923
01:08:30,541 --> 01:08:33,380
(to make him express his feelings.)

1924
01:08:33,381 --> 01:08:35,603
(She clears the 2nd mission when he says that his heart fluttered.)

1925
01:08:35,980 --> 01:08:39,586
(She clears 2 missions quickly.)

1926
01:08:40,581 --> 01:08:42,049
(She has to make him wipe off her mouth.)

1927
01:08:42,050 --> 01:08:43,689
(She's fidgety.)

1928
01:08:43,690 --> 01:08:44,820
Wide it off for me.

1929
01:08:44,821 --> 01:08:46,881
(Do you want me to wipe it off for you?)

1930
01:08:47,390 --> 01:08:48,602
Wide it off for me.

1931
01:08:49,331 --> 01:08:50,530
(She gets up.)

1932
01:08:50,531 --> 01:08:51,672
I'll come to you.

1933
01:08:51,930 --> 01:08:53,860
(If you really want it, I'll come to you.)

1934
01:08:53,861 --> 01:08:56,122
You have a lot on you.

1935
01:08:56,201 --> 01:08:57,281
Thank you.

1936
01:08:57,571 --> 01:08:59,839
(She clears the mission of having him wipe off her mouth.)

1937
01:08:59,840 --> 01:09:02,335
- Thank you. - Let's make it look pretty.

1938
01:09:02,611 --> 01:09:04,429
Let's make it look pretty.

1939
01:09:04,680 --> 01:09:06,139
- Pretty? - Let's do it again.

1940
01:09:06,140 --> 01:09:07,479
If you want to make it pretty,

1941
01:09:07,480 --> 01:09:09,080
we have to do it like in "Secret Garden".

1942
01:09:09,081 --> 01:09:10,349
When I eat,

1943
01:09:10,350 --> 01:09:11,750
you have to wipe it off with your mouth.

1944
01:09:11,751 --> 01:09:13,219
You have to wipe it off with your mouth.

1945
01:09:13,220 --> 01:09:15,715
I'll use my hand instead.

1946
01:09:16,350 --> 01:09:18,410
- Are you pretending not to hear me? - You don't realize it yourself.

1947
01:09:18,861 --> 01:09:19,871
Do you get it?

1948
01:09:19,961 --> 01:09:21,630
Okay, start.

1949
01:09:21,631 --> 01:09:23,711
(So Min doesn't realize that she has soup on her, and he finds it.)

1950
01:09:24,701 --> 01:09:28,469
(She opens her mouth wide and eats some soup.)

1951
01:09:28,470 --> 01:09:30,469
(It's delicious.)

1952
01:09:30,470 --> 01:09:33,097
(He looks at So Min lovingly as she has soup on her face.)

1953
01:09:33,541 --> 01:09:34,984
- So Min. - Yes?

1954
01:09:37,010 --> 01:09:38,656
- Right here. - What?

1955
01:09:39,180 --> 01:09:40,292
Where?

1956
01:09:40,611 --> 01:09:42,250
Gosh, you're clumsy.

1957
01:09:42,251 --> 01:09:43,866
(He looks at her gently.)

1958
01:09:43,911 --> 01:09:47,519
(Let's make it pretty like in a drama.)

1959
01:09:47,520 --> 01:09:52,036
(You have to wipe it off with your mouth.)

1960
01:09:52,260 --> 01:09:53,420
(He wipes it off with his hand instead of his lips.)

1961
01:09:53,421 --> 01:09:54,773
I'll do it.

1962
01:09:55,090 --> 01:09:57,130
Let me wipe it off again.

1963
01:09:57,131 --> 01:09:58,817
Thank you, Ji Suk.

1964
01:09:58,861 --> 01:10:01,599
He's such a detailed person.

1965
01:10:01,600 --> 01:10:02,641
By the way,

1966
01:10:02,701 --> 01:10:07,084
I had the most kissing scenes with you.

1967
01:10:07,171 --> 01:10:08,469
Every time I get closer to you,

1968
01:10:08,470 --> 01:10:10,188
(He had the most kissing scenes with So Min.)

1969
01:10:10,371 --> 01:10:11,839
it feels different.

1970
01:10:11,840 --> 01:10:14,840
(It feels different to see you here.)

1971
01:10:14,850 --> 01:10:16,780
- It's because of this set. - Right.

1972
01:10:16,781 --> 01:10:18,063
- Don't you think so? - You're right.

1973
01:10:18,680 --> 01:10:19,690
That's right.

1974
01:10:20,621 --> 01:10:21,660
That's right.

1975
01:10:21,720 --> 01:10:23,266
Why do you keep repeating it?

1976
01:10:23,491 --> 01:10:25,035
What's so right?

1977
01:10:25,090 --> 01:10:26,706
It feels so awkward.

1978
01:10:26,760 --> 01:10:28,044
Let's change it then.

1979
01:10:28,090 --> 01:10:29,575
How? Shall we play a game?

1980
01:10:29,631 --> 01:10:30,671
How?

1981
01:10:31,461 --> 01:10:32,571
How about this?

1982
01:10:32,861 --> 01:10:34,214
We haven't seen each other in a while.

1983
01:10:34,230 --> 01:10:36,269
- Let's see if there's telepathy. - That sounds good.

1984
01:10:36,270 --> 01:10:37,399
How about this?

1985
01:10:37,400 --> 01:10:38,570
After a count of three...

1986
01:10:38,571 --> 01:10:40,722
(A test to see if their answers are the same)

1987
01:10:40,970 --> 01:10:42,960
Sea or mountain? 1, 2, 3.

1988
01:10:43,010 --> 01:10:44,051
- Sea. - Sea.

1989
01:10:44,440 --> 01:10:47,207
A drink that you enjoy having when you're tired.

1990
01:10:47,340 --> 01:10:48,450
- 1, 2, 3. - 2, 3.

1991
01:10:48,451 --> 01:10:49,561
- Coke. - Coke.

1992
01:10:50,480 --> 01:10:51,880
(I know well, don't I?)

1993
01:10:51,881 --> 01:10:52,880
I'll get everything right.

1994
01:10:52,881 --> 01:10:53,920
During the shoot,

1995
01:10:53,921 --> 01:10:57,627
what was your favorite food?

1996
01:10:57,661 --> 01:10:59,389
What? There are so many.

1997
01:10:59,390 --> 01:11:00,572
We recognized it...

1998
01:11:00,690 --> 01:11:02,245
as soon as we took the smell of it.

1999
01:11:02,331 --> 01:11:03,630
Do you remember?

2000
01:11:03,631 --> 01:11:04,759
1, 2, 3.

2001
01:11:04,760 --> 01:11:05,810
- Pork cutlet. - Pork cutlet.

2002
01:11:06,760 --> 01:11:09,660
(Their answers are the same 3 consecutive times.)

2003
01:11:10,470 --> 01:11:11,582
Let's do another one.

2004
01:11:12,671 --> 01:11:14,639
Who did we talk...

2005
01:11:14,640 --> 01:11:15,910
about the most behind their back?

2006
01:11:15,911 --> 01:11:17,210
(Who did we talk about the most behind their back?)

2007
01:11:17,211 --> 01:11:19,866
(The person we talked about the most behind their back?)

2008
01:11:20,510 --> 01:11:21,692
Can we say it?

2009
01:11:21,911 --> 01:11:24,133
- It's because you had affection. - It was out of affection.

2010
01:11:24,480 --> 01:11:26,097
- You wanted his love. - Right.

2011
01:11:26,220 --> 01:11:27,380
- 1, 2, 3. - 1, 2, 3.

2012
01:11:27,381 --> 01:11:28,519
- Director. - Director.

2013
01:11:28,520 --> 01:11:29,990
(Our beloved director)

2014
01:11:29,991 --> 01:11:31,981
(Yes, that's right.)

2015
01:11:32,390 --> 01:11:34,120
He only liked Sang Yeob.

2016
01:11:34,121 --> 01:11:35,490
That's true.

2017
01:11:35,491 --> 01:11:37,854
He felt bad for Sang Yeob.

2018
01:11:38,230 --> 01:11:39,229
That's why...

2019
01:11:39,230 --> 01:11:41,399
he was most affectionate to him.

2020
01:11:41,400 --> 01:11:43,955
Sang Yeob wasn't well.

2021
01:11:44,100 --> 01:11:46,839
He was having a hard time.

2022
01:11:46,840 --> 01:11:49,598
That's why the director wanted to take care of him.

2023
01:11:49,611 --> 01:11:52,339
He thought that Sang Yeob was lonely.

2024
01:11:52,340 --> 01:11:55,987
You don't stop talking about Sang Yeob.

2025
01:11:56,911 --> 01:11:58,093
That's strange.

2026
01:11:58,751 --> 01:12:01,276
So what happened?

2027
01:12:01,550 --> 01:12:03,711
How did you feel?

2028
01:12:03,821 --> 01:12:05,790
Were you ever jealous of Sang Yeob?

2029
01:12:05,791 --> 01:12:07,259
(It's a direct question.)

2030
01:12:07,260 --> 01:12:10,190
(Please say that you were jealous.)

2031
01:12:11,861 --> 01:12:14,000
- I thought Sang Yeob... - I thought you liked Sang Yeob.

2032
01:12:14,001 --> 01:12:15,729
(I thought you liked Sang Yeob.)

2033
01:12:15,730 --> 01:12:17,570
That's a misunderstanding.

2034
01:12:17,571 --> 01:12:19,217
I don't have feelings for Sang Yeob.

2035
01:12:19,671 --> 01:12:20,870
You were so sweet to him.

2036
01:12:20,871 --> 01:12:22,123
- No. - To Sang Yeob.

2037
01:12:22,140 --> 01:12:23,585
I'm envious of Sang Yeob.

2038
01:12:23,840 --> 01:12:24,939
You're envious?

2039
01:12:24,940 --> 01:12:26,224
- Are you jealous? - Yes.

2040
01:12:26,881 --> 01:12:27,991
Did you do it on purpose?

2041
01:12:28,050 --> 01:12:29,525
- No. - Did someone order you?

2042
01:12:29,680 --> 01:12:31,498
- That's not it. - Why?

2043
01:12:31,720 --> 01:12:33,568
Were you ever jealous of Sang Yeob?

2044
01:12:34,690 --> 01:12:35,862
I was many times...

2045
01:12:36,150 --> 01:12:37,878
since our first meeting.

2046
01:12:38,461 --> 01:12:39,804
When I came back from the restroom,

2047
01:12:40,461 --> 01:12:41,601
the two of you were...

2048
01:12:41,831 --> 01:12:43,043
sitting so close.

2049
01:12:43,961 --> 01:12:45,718
When I returned, you stayed back.

2050
01:12:46,661 --> 01:12:48,700
- That was... - I didn't know you well.

2051
01:12:48,701 --> 01:12:49,912
I get jealous easily.

2052
01:12:50,571 --> 01:12:51,712
So?

2053
01:12:52,071 --> 01:12:53,253
Were you jealous?

2054
01:12:53,300 --> 01:12:54,422
I'll be honest.

2055
01:12:55,340 --> 01:12:56,469
I was a little...

2056
01:12:56,470 --> 01:12:57,540
(Please say that you were jealous.)

2057
01:12:57,541 --> 01:12:58,880
Speaking of Sang Yeob...

2058
01:12:58,881 --> 01:13:00,809
(Please hurry.)

2059
01:13:00,810 --> 01:13:03,080
(She must clear all the missions to go on her next date.)

2060
01:13:03,081 --> 01:13:04,950
(Will he say it?)

2061
01:13:04,951 --> 01:13:06,349
I should be...

2062
01:13:06,350 --> 01:13:07,689
more confident about myself.

2063
01:13:07,690 --> 01:13:09,389
(He changes his subject to being confident.)

2064
01:13:09,390 --> 01:13:11,420
(Confidence instead of jealousy?)

2065
01:13:11,421 --> 01:13:12,889
I shouldn't keep complaining.

2066
01:13:12,890 --> 01:13:14,376
(Confidence instead of jealousy?)

2067
01:13:14,631 --> 01:13:15,974
Even if you mention Sang Yeob,

2068
01:13:16,690 --> 01:13:17,873
I'll accept it.

2069
01:13:18,430 --> 01:13:23,229
(This isn't what I wanted.)

2070
01:13:23,230 --> 01:13:24,769
I'm so curious.

2071
01:13:24,770 --> 01:13:27,669
(She doesn't give up.)

2072
01:13:27,741 --> 01:13:29,054
What are you curious about?

2073
01:13:29,671 --> 01:13:31,023
I'm wondering...

2074
01:13:31,111 --> 01:13:34,141
if you were jealous of Sang Yeob or someone else.

2075
01:13:34,911 --> 01:13:37,133
I answered. Why do you keep bringing up Sang Yeob?

2076
01:13:37,850 --> 01:13:40,679
(He's getting farther away from saying that he was jealous.)

2077
01:13:40,680 --> 01:13:41,889
I miss Sang Yeob all of a sudden.

2078
01:13:41,890 --> 01:13:42,962
(She makes a big impact.)

2079
01:13:43,690 --> 01:13:46,120
I understand what's going on.

2080
01:13:46,121 --> 01:13:47,620
(Did Ji Suk understand something?)

2081
01:13:47,621 --> 01:13:48,701
Listen.

2082
01:13:48,961 --> 01:13:51,223
(Did he realize it already?)

2083
01:13:51,560 --> 01:13:52,700
Listen.

2084
01:13:52,701 --> 01:13:55,427
This is what I heard about when a man and a woman are on a date.

2085
01:13:55,571 --> 01:13:58,773
Women don't like men who make them...

2086
01:13:58,800 --> 01:14:00,839
- feel awkward and uncomfortable. - No.

2087
01:14:00,840 --> 01:14:03,370
(Misunderstanding is getting worse.)

2088
01:14:03,371 --> 01:14:04,509
Right?

2089
01:14:04,510 --> 01:14:07,005
That's why you miss Sang Yeob whom you feel comfortable with.

2090
01:14:07,041 --> 01:14:09,475
I suddenly wished that he were here.

2091
01:14:09,480 --> 01:14:10,479
So you're saying that...

2092
01:14:10,480 --> 01:14:11,920
- I'm not enough. - That's not it.

2093
01:14:11,921 --> 01:14:13,580
- If Sang Yeob is with us, - I understand now.

2094
01:14:13,581 --> 01:14:14,719
it'd be less awkward.

2095
01:14:14,720 --> 01:14:16,149
- I know. - We'd have a lot to talk about.

2096
01:14:16,150 --> 01:14:17,939
It's too boring for you...

2097
01:14:18,421 --> 01:14:20,290
to be with me only, right?

2098
01:14:20,291 --> 01:14:22,311
(It must be too boring to be with me only.)

2099
01:14:22,361 --> 01:14:23,490
That's not true.

2100
01:14:23,491 --> 01:14:25,630
(That's not what I mean, Ji Suk.)

2101
01:14:25,631 --> 01:14:28,000
That hurts both me and Sang Yeob.

2102
01:14:28,001 --> 01:14:29,200
That's not what I mean.

2103
01:14:29,201 --> 01:14:30,716
- I'm leaving. - No.

2104
01:14:31,140 --> 01:14:32,139
(She's close to ruining the date.)

2105
01:14:32,140 --> 01:14:35,240
Please don't go. Don't go.

2106
01:14:35,241 --> 01:14:38,009
You have to play with me today. That's why you came here.

2107
01:14:38,010 --> 01:14:39,597
(How will their conversation about Sang Yeob end?)

2108
01:14:40,911 --> 01:14:42,610
How do we get out of here?

2109
01:14:42,611 --> 01:14:43,710
(7 members are busy looking for hints.)

2110
01:14:43,711 --> 01:14:45,164
Is this live?

2111
01:14:46,050 --> 01:14:48,142
How do we open the safe?

2112
01:14:48,150 --> 01:14:49,290
- Jong Kook. - Yes?

2113
01:14:49,291 --> 01:14:50,719
I think we should put this in here.

2114
01:14:50,720 --> 01:14:52,740
- What? - Don't we insert this car...

2115
01:14:52,890 --> 01:14:54,460
(Should we insert this toy car in the socket over there?)

2116
01:14:54,461 --> 01:14:55,559
- Don't you think? - I think so.

2117
01:14:55,560 --> 01:14:56,975
Right? It seems like it.

2118
01:14:57,031 --> 01:14:58,229
"Power off"?

2119
01:14:58,230 --> 01:14:59,729
(Underneath the safe, there's a small hole...)

2120
01:14:59,730 --> 01:15:01,216
(and suspicious words that say "power off".)

2121
01:15:01,930 --> 01:15:03,929
(That must be it.)

2122
01:15:03,930 --> 01:15:05,399
This is it.

2123
01:15:05,400 --> 01:15:06,670
- Do we plug it? - Kwang Soo.

2124
01:15:06,671 --> 01:15:07,923
- Yes? - Use your long arm.

2125
01:15:08,270 --> 01:15:09,710
Your arm is long.

2126
01:15:09,711 --> 01:15:10,983
You may reach with your arm.

2127
01:15:12,111 --> 01:15:13,540
- It's done. - No, Seok Jin.

2128
01:15:13,541 --> 01:15:14,710
That's not it.

2129
01:15:14,711 --> 01:15:16,049
- I took a look. - This is it.

2130
01:15:16,050 --> 01:15:17,280
- This is it. - This?

2131
01:15:17,281 --> 01:15:19,719
I was wondering why it was here.

2132
01:15:19,720 --> 01:15:21,080
- It should be plugged in. - Plug it in.

2133
01:15:21,081 --> 01:15:22,250
Wait a minute.

2134
01:15:22,251 --> 01:15:24,019
I think this car should be turned on.

2135
01:15:24,020 --> 01:15:25,420
(However, there are no batteries.)

2136
01:15:25,421 --> 01:15:26,719
It doesn't work.

2137
01:15:26,720 --> 01:15:28,030
Are there any batteries?

2138
01:15:28,031 --> 01:15:29,030
(The car doesn't work without batteries.)

2139
01:15:29,031 --> 01:15:30,070
Batteries.

2140
01:15:30,461 --> 01:15:32,660
(While the toy car is not plugged into the safe...)

2141
01:15:32,661 --> 01:15:34,059
We have to insert money.

2142
01:15:34,060 --> 01:15:36,130
(Another group is working with the drawing machine.)

2143
01:15:36,131 --> 01:15:37,170
(Shall we take a look?)

2144
01:15:37,171 --> 01:15:38,269
- I can see it. - Here it is.

2145
01:15:38,270 --> 01:15:39,351
(Shall we take a look?)

2146
01:15:40,640 --> 01:15:42,024
(Buzzing)

2147
01:15:42,411 --> 01:15:44,639
- We got it. - So Min is on a date while we...

2148
01:15:44,640 --> 01:15:46,700
Is there anything inside, Seok Jin?

2149
01:15:47,850 --> 01:15:51,420
(A transparent capsule is in the drawing machine.)

2150
01:15:51,421 --> 01:15:54,019
(He moves it carefully.)

2151
01:15:54,020 --> 01:15:56,171
(He smiles. That's right.)

2152
01:15:56,821 --> 01:15:57,990
(Clicking)

2153
01:15:57,991 --> 01:15:59,132
It came out.

2154
01:15:59,760 --> 01:16:02,990
(They draw one out and open it.)

2155
01:16:02,991 --> 01:16:04,460
- Is there anything? - No.

2156
01:16:04,461 --> 01:16:07,460
(It's just an empty piece of paper.)

2157
01:16:07,461 --> 01:16:09,653
(He's quite upset.)

2158
01:16:10,270 --> 01:16:12,825
(What's wrong with this now?)

2159
01:16:13,501 --> 01:16:14,969
(When it's frustrating,)

2160
01:16:14,970 --> 01:16:16,110
It's annoying.

2161
01:16:16,111 --> 01:16:18,837
(Let's just put this upside down.)

2162
01:16:19,440 --> 01:16:21,431
(She pours it out.)

2163
01:16:22,251 --> 01:16:23,594
It's upsetting.

2164
01:16:24,350 --> 01:16:26,037
- What are you doing? - We don't have time.

2165
01:16:27,081 --> 01:16:28,100
(Tapping)

2166
01:16:28,291 --> 01:16:29,790
Just do it.

2167
01:16:29,791 --> 01:16:31,189
(This isn't how to play it.)

2168
01:16:31,190 --> 01:16:32,460
It works. There's a T.

2169
01:16:32,461 --> 01:16:33,673
Hey!

2170
01:16:34,461 --> 01:16:36,790
- There's a hint. - We found something.

2171
01:16:36,791 --> 01:16:38,618
(They find a useful hint.)

2172
01:16:38,701 --> 01:16:39,842
It says "T".

2173
01:16:40,100 --> 01:16:41,370
- It's English. - There are hints.

2174
01:16:41,371 --> 01:16:43,229
- Did you draw one? - No, we drew several.

2175
01:16:43,230 --> 01:16:44,382
Open that one.

2176
01:16:44,531 --> 01:16:45,740
- Did you draw any? - There are more.

2177
01:16:45,741 --> 01:16:46,769
- Yes. - Did you draw any?

2178
01:16:46,770 --> 01:16:49,064
There are hints inside.

2179
01:16:49,211 --> 01:16:50,928
What is it?

2180
01:16:51,440 --> 01:16:53,210
There are hints inside the drawing machine.

2181
01:16:53,211 --> 01:16:54,695
- Is that so? - What is it?

2182
01:16:55,211 --> 01:16:57,049
- Why isn't it working? - Hints are in this machine.

2183
01:16:57,050 --> 01:16:59,450
(Do it like Ji Hyo.)

2184
01:16:59,451 --> 01:17:00,780
Just pour them out.

2185
01:17:00,781 --> 01:17:02,250
- Goodness. - There's a C.

2186
01:17:02,251 --> 01:17:04,108
My goodness.

2187
01:17:05,390 --> 01:17:06,960
- It works this way. - What are you doing?

2188
01:17:06,961 --> 01:17:08,130
Put them up here.

2189
01:17:08,131 --> 01:17:09,259
Put them up and take a look.

2190
01:17:09,260 --> 01:17:10,929
- T, O. - Do it like this.

2191
01:17:10,930 --> 01:17:13,022
- There's also a C. - It's English.

2192
01:17:14,031 --> 01:17:15,414
- Let's see. - There's an H.

2193
01:17:15,600 --> 01:17:16,870
Yes, H.

2194
01:17:16,871 --> 01:17:18,053
Goodness.

2195
01:17:18,300 --> 01:17:19,469
What is it?

2196
01:17:19,470 --> 01:17:20,783
It's English.

2197
01:17:22,510 --> 01:17:24,780
Can we make a word with these letters?

2198
01:17:24,781 --> 01:17:26,540
- W, H, O. - T, O.

2199
01:17:26,541 --> 01:17:27,950
Is there another T?

2200
01:17:27,951 --> 01:17:29,910
- T, O, T. - Are they based on colors?

2201
01:17:29,911 --> 01:17:31,840
- Isn't it "WOO"? - That's amazing.

2202
01:17:32,121 --> 01:17:33,679
- "WOO"? - Is it "WOO"?

2203
01:17:33,680 --> 01:17:35,019
That startled me.

2204
01:17:35,020 --> 01:17:36,490
- What is it? - That startled me.

2205
01:17:36,491 --> 01:17:38,237
(Kwang Soo collapses.)

2206
01:17:38,321 --> 01:17:40,846
(There's something under the table.)

2207
01:17:41,190 --> 01:17:42,530
- Who is it? - Is there someone?

2208
01:17:42,531 --> 01:17:44,030
Someone grabbed my legs.

2209
01:17:44,031 --> 01:17:45,229
He's a cameraman.

2210
01:17:45,230 --> 01:17:46,899
(Kwang Soo's cameraman went after Kwang Soo's legs.)

2211
01:17:46,900 --> 01:17:48,991
(Kwang Soo, it's me.)

2212
01:17:49,531 --> 01:17:50,799
(The cameraman and Kwang Soo become distant by 120 points.)

2213
01:17:50,800 --> 01:17:52,589
- Is it the camera? - Is it English?

2214
01:17:52,840 --> 01:17:53,870
It's English.

2215
01:17:53,871 --> 01:17:55,040
C, H.

2216
01:17:55,041 --> 01:17:56,339
- "Catch". - "Cha"?

2217
01:17:56,340 --> 01:17:57,740
How about "car"?

2218
01:17:57,741 --> 01:17:59,309
Isn't it "catch"?

2219
01:17:59,310 --> 01:18:01,199
C, A, T, C, H. It's not it.

2220
01:18:01,411 --> 01:18:03,149
- It is "catch". - No.

2221
01:18:03,150 --> 01:18:04,939
- "Catch". - There's a U.

2222
01:18:05,581 --> 01:18:07,399
- What is it? - W, A.

2223
01:18:07,621 --> 01:18:09,308
W, A, T, C, H.

2224
01:18:09,390 --> 01:18:11,320
- "Wow"? - It's "watch".

2225
01:18:11,321 --> 01:18:12,460
- "Watch". - W.

2226
01:18:12,461 --> 01:18:14,914
- It's "Watch". - "Watch".

2227
01:18:14,991 --> 01:18:16,506
- W. - There's an O.

2228
01:18:16,831 --> 01:18:18,929
Wait, let's do it slowly.

2229
01:18:18,930 --> 01:18:20,460
- Wait. - I have no idea.

2230
01:18:20,461 --> 01:18:22,070
O, U, T.

2231
01:18:22,071 --> 01:18:24,192
- Doesn't it mean out? - It's "out".

2232
01:18:24,371 --> 01:18:26,117
- O, U, T. - O, U, T.

2233
01:18:26,241 --> 01:18:27,740
Will someone be out?

2234
01:18:27,741 --> 01:18:28,952
"Watch out"?

2235
01:18:29,440 --> 01:18:30,724
It's "watch out".

2236
01:18:30,770 --> 01:18:32,210
- "Watch out". - To be careful?

2237
01:18:32,211 --> 01:18:33,580
- "Watch out". - To be careful?

2238
01:18:33,581 --> 01:18:35,509
- "Watch". It's "Watch out". - "Watch out"?

2239
01:18:35,510 --> 01:18:36,549
What does it mean?

2240
01:18:36,550 --> 01:18:37,549
- Be careful. - It means to be careful.

2241
01:18:37,550 --> 01:18:38,780
Does "watch out" mean to be careful?

2242
01:18:38,781 --> 01:18:40,380
- Yes. - Watch out.

2243
01:18:40,381 --> 01:18:43,149
Is one of us helping So Min?

2244
01:18:43,150 --> 01:18:44,907
Does she have a helper?

2245
01:18:44,961 --> 01:18:46,320
Does "watch out" mean to be careful?

2246
01:18:46,321 --> 01:18:47,320
It's him.

2247
01:18:47,321 --> 01:18:48,589
(At a time like this, it's always him.)

2248
01:18:48,590 --> 01:18:50,751
Come here. You looked suspicious after getting a haircut.

2249
01:18:51,291 --> 01:18:53,030
(Kwang Soo is suspicious because of his haircut.)

2250
01:18:53,031 --> 01:18:54,460
- What about me? - It's him.

2251
01:18:54,461 --> 01:18:55,813
What's wrong with you?

2252
01:18:55,900 --> 01:18:57,269
- Yes. - Wait.

2253
01:18:57,270 --> 01:18:58,370
- It must be Kwang Soo. - This one is right.

2254
01:18:58,371 --> 01:19:00,040
- Isn't it you, Ji Hyo? - It's not me.

2255
01:19:00,041 --> 01:19:01,469
I'm doing my best here.

2256
01:19:01,470 --> 01:19:02,870
- Isn't it you? - It's not me, Jae Seok.

2257
01:19:02,871 --> 01:19:04,009
It's really not me.

2258
01:19:04,010 --> 01:19:05,610
- Be careful, Ji Hyo. - It's not me.

2259
01:19:05,611 --> 01:19:06,780
(When they don't believe each other...)

2260
01:19:06,781 --> 01:19:09,880
There's a clock right here.

2261
01:19:09,881 --> 01:19:11,479
- Isn't this... - Kwang Soo.

2262
01:19:11,480 --> 01:19:13,549
(Hey, Kwang Soo!)

2263
01:19:13,550 --> 01:19:14,549
Before we understand the hint,

2264
01:19:14,550 --> 01:19:16,349
- don't get ahead of yourself. - What happened?

2265
01:19:16,350 --> 01:19:18,460
What do you know?

2266
01:19:18,461 --> 01:19:19,960
(There he goes again.)

2267
01:19:19,961 --> 01:19:23,030
He becomes serious only when we're stuck.

2268
01:19:23,031 --> 01:19:25,530
I understand that Jae Seok enjoys it.

2269
01:19:25,531 --> 01:19:27,419
- Stay still. - Is this how it's done?

2270
01:19:27,861 --> 01:19:29,570
It's "watch out".

2271
01:19:29,571 --> 01:19:31,994
It's "watch out". It means to be careful.

2272
01:19:32,241 --> 01:19:34,939
(Does "watch" indicate the clock?)

2273
01:19:34,940 --> 01:19:36,339
There's a clock.

2274
01:19:36,340 --> 01:19:37,809
(They search the clock that doesn't work.)

2275
01:19:37,810 --> 01:19:39,153
(Unlocking)

2276
01:19:40,581 --> 01:19:41,950
What?

2277
01:19:41,951 --> 01:19:43,426
"Even I will disappear."

2278
01:19:43,980 --> 01:19:45,280
(They find a hint.)

2279
01:19:45,281 --> 01:19:46,479
- What is it? - "Even I will disappear."

2280
01:19:46,480 --> 01:19:48,290
There's a hint in the clock.

2281
01:19:48,291 --> 01:19:50,450
"Even I will disappear."

2282
01:19:50,451 --> 01:19:51,620
(There's a phrase in the clock.)

2283
01:19:51,621 --> 01:19:53,860
- "Even I will disappear"? - "Even I will disappear."

2284
01:19:53,861 --> 01:19:56,012
- What? - "Even I will disappear."

2285
01:19:56,361 --> 01:19:58,130
(What does it say?)

2286
01:19:58,131 --> 01:20:00,281
There must be a spy among us.

2287
01:20:00,361 --> 01:20:01,799
Do we make...

2288
01:20:01,800 --> 01:20:03,749
a word with the hints in this room?

2289
01:20:04,571 --> 01:20:06,240
- Wait, Jae Seok. - What?

2290
01:20:06,241 --> 01:20:08,331
There's another clock, Jae Seok.

2291
01:20:08,411 --> 01:20:10,269
- What? - There's another clock.

2292
01:20:10,270 --> 01:20:11,740
Look at the time.

2293
01:20:11,741 --> 01:20:13,339
- Kwang Soo. - Yes?

2294
01:20:13,340 --> 01:20:14,896
Can you bring down the clock?

2295
01:20:15,180 --> 01:20:16,262
Yes, bring it down.

2296
01:20:16,680 --> 01:20:18,149
Bring down the clock.

2297
01:20:18,150 --> 01:20:19,580
- Look. - It's in a strange place.

2298
01:20:19,581 --> 01:20:21,250
The clock looks crooked.

2299
01:20:21,251 --> 01:20:22,589
It looks strange.

2300
01:20:22,590 --> 01:20:23,920
(They look into the second clock.)

2301
01:20:23,921 --> 01:20:25,360
Someone just randomly put it up there.

2302
01:20:25,361 --> 01:20:26,920
Right, it's strange that a clock is here.

2303
01:20:26,921 --> 01:20:28,229
- There's something. - There is.

2304
01:20:28,230 --> 01:20:29,259
- Is there? - Yes.

2305
01:20:29,260 --> 01:20:30,270
(There's something.)

2306
01:20:30,361 --> 01:20:31,500
- There is. - "If standing up straight".

2307
01:20:31,501 --> 01:20:32,559
See?

2308
01:20:32,560 --> 01:20:34,075
"If standing up straight".

2309
01:20:34,331 --> 01:20:37,401
(It says, "If standing up straight".)

2310
01:20:37,900 --> 01:20:39,339
("If standing up straight"?)

2311
01:20:39,340 --> 01:20:40,540
- What does it mean? - "Straight".

2312
01:20:40,541 --> 01:20:41,823
Put them all together.

2313
01:20:41,871 --> 01:20:43,729
- They're over there. - Hey.

2314
01:20:43,840 --> 01:20:45,193
Does "watch out" mean...

2315
01:20:45,581 --> 01:20:47,529
to take the clocks outside?

2316
01:20:47,711 --> 01:20:50,509
Is there a way to escape if we find the clocks?

2317
01:20:50,510 --> 01:20:53,219
(Does "watch out" mean that they can escape if they find the clocks?)

2318
01:20:53,220 --> 01:20:54,450
"Standing straight" indicates something...

2319
01:20:54,451 --> 01:20:55,820
- different from what we know. - This must be it.

2320
01:20:55,821 --> 01:20:57,019
Really?

2321
01:20:57,020 --> 01:20:58,374
(What will be the result?)

2322
01:20:58,821 --> 01:21:01,558
(Their real escape starts now.)

2323
01:21:01,631 --> 01:21:04,089
(It gets scarier in the mysterious secret room.)

2324
01:21:04,090 --> 01:21:06,656
(They finally find a significant hint.)

2325
01:21:06,800 --> 01:21:08,269
(In the room with a blackout,)

2326
01:21:08,270 --> 01:21:10,755
(where's a beam of light coming from?)

2327
01:21:11,131 --> 01:21:13,700
(Their dreamlike date starts now.)

2328
01:21:13,701 --> 01:21:17,074
(Or so they thought.)

2329
01:21:17,340 --> 01:21:20,040
(So Min has another date other than Ji Suk.)

2330
01:21:20,041 --> 01:21:21,696
(Fight over me.)

2331
01:21:22,310 --> 01:21:24,750
(Will So Min be able to enjoy the soap opera...)

2332
01:21:24,751 --> 01:21:27,174
(that she has dreamed of?)

2333
01:21:27,381 --> 01:21:29,036
(And)

2334
01:21:29,720 --> 01:21:32,660
(Members chase after So Min who is in love.)

2335
01:21:32,661 --> 01:21:34,960
(So Min's race to keep her wallet safe starts.)

2336
01:21:34,961 --> 01:21:36,778
(How will their race end?)

2337
01:21:37,791 --> 01:21:40,456
(One Fine Spring Day)
