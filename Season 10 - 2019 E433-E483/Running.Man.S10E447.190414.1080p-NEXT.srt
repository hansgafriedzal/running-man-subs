1
00:00:05,320 --> 00:00:06,733
(Last week)

2
00:00:07,431 --> 00:00:08,500
(It was a special episode...)

3
00:00:08,501 --> 00:00:09,529
(to celebrate So Min's birthday, April 7.)

4
00:00:09,530 --> 00:00:12,699
(Thrilling Real Variety)

5
00:00:12,700 --> 00:00:15,999
(The first date was with Kim Ji Suk, her co-star in her drama.)

6
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,569
(She couldn't stop smiling the whole time.)

7
00:00:18,570 --> 00:00:19,883
- I'm pretty? - Yes.

8
00:00:19,910 --> 00:00:21,709
(However,)

9
00:00:21,710 --> 00:00:24,510
(the members are going to pay for So Min's date?)

10
00:00:24,511 --> 00:00:27,779
(They must eliminate So Min to avoid paying and facing the penalty.)

11
00:00:27,780 --> 00:00:30,920
(So Min who's looking for love versus jealous members)

12
00:00:30,921 --> 00:00:33,587
(The first mission to locate So Min was the escape room.)

13
00:00:33,860 --> 00:00:35,759
(He figured out the hint. "It's 'Watch out'.")

14
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:37,630
(They checked the clocks.)

15
00:00:37,631 --> 00:00:40,859
(Hints from the clocks: "Even I will disappear"...)

16
00:00:40,860 --> 00:00:43,399
(and "If standing up straight")

17
00:00:43,400 --> 00:00:46,734
(What do these two sentences mean?)

18
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,539
That means that you're standing up without moving.

19
00:00:49,540 --> 00:00:51,009
- Standing still. - Standing still isn't the same.

20
00:00:51,010 --> 00:00:52,310
Standing still is...

21
00:00:52,311 --> 00:00:55,039
- the origin of standing upright. - I figured it out.

22
00:00:55,040 --> 00:00:57,909
(Did Kwang Soo figure something out?)

23
00:00:58,451 --> 00:01:02,279
- On So Min's social media... - That's right.

24
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:04,350
- "Standing up straight". - That's right. She wrote that.

25
00:01:04,351 --> 00:01:06,573
- Those sentimental lines? - That's right.

26
00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:11,330
(Her writing on her social media made everyone cringe last winter.)

27
00:01:12,060 --> 00:01:15,061
"Even if I walk all day long to reach you..."

28
00:01:15,161 --> 00:01:18,261
"Standing up straight will even make me disappear."

29
00:01:19,230 --> 00:01:23,453
(These two sentences were key lines of her pretentious poem.)

30
00:01:24,710 --> 00:01:26,679
(In other words, the hints are pointing to So Min's poem.)

31
00:01:26,680 --> 00:01:28,498
- That's right. - That must be it.

32
00:01:28,510 --> 00:01:30,268
Yes, I think I've seen that in her poem.

33
00:01:30,310 --> 00:01:31,724
My gosh, So Min.

34
00:01:32,581 --> 00:01:33,720
Hey, this is what I think.

35
00:01:33,721 --> 00:01:36,550
- I think batteries will be inside. - That's right.

36
00:01:36,551 --> 00:01:38,619
- Then... - We can insert batteries somewhere.

37
00:01:38,620 --> 00:01:41,084
(The password consists of 10 letters of the alphabet.)

38
00:01:41,891 --> 00:01:44,459
"Standing up straight will even make me disappear."

39
00:01:44,460 --> 00:01:45,975
My gosh, how are we supposed to open this up with that?

40
00:01:46,430 --> 00:01:48,300
She posted the poem on the day of the first snow.

41
00:01:48,301 --> 00:01:49,411
(What do these hints mean?)

42
00:01:49,831 --> 00:01:51,030
(Searching for clues to open the safe)

43
00:01:51,031 --> 00:01:52,199
What is this? There's nothing here.

44
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:53,869
I'm getting so frustrated. I hate escape rooms.

45
00:01:53,870 --> 00:01:54,952
What does that mean?

46
00:01:55,101 --> 00:01:56,869
Hey, they're almost done with their meal.

47
00:01:56,870 --> 00:01:58,809
(He's startled.)

48
00:01:58,810 --> 00:02:00,640
- Let me see. - We must hurry.

49
00:02:00,641 --> 00:02:01,752
We can still catch them.

50
00:02:02,381 --> 00:02:03,709
This is terrible.

51
00:02:03,710 --> 00:02:05,095
(Will they be able to put a stop on her date?)

52
00:02:05,650 --> 00:02:06,819
I'm so full.

53
00:02:06,820 --> 00:02:07,961
I can't eat a lot.

54
00:02:08,651 --> 00:02:09,893
You usually eat a lot.

55
00:02:09,950 --> 00:02:11,120
Yes, I usually eat a lot.

56
00:02:11,121 --> 00:02:12,949
(She just said that she was full.)

57
00:02:12,950 --> 00:02:15,859
(But she's gulping down a glass of water.)

58
00:02:15,860 --> 00:02:18,489
(Actually, this wasn't an ordinary date either.)

59
00:02:18,490 --> 00:02:21,400
(So Min received a hidden mission before Ji Suk arrived.)

60
00:02:21,401 --> 00:02:22,900
(She must complete everything on the list to move on.)

61
00:02:22,901 --> 00:02:24,500
(Hearing "pretty", "I'm excited", "jealous")

62
00:02:24,501 --> 00:02:27,298
(and getting him to cut her steak and to wipe her mouth)

63
00:02:27,740 --> 00:02:32,069
(It's impossible unless I have the sweetest guy.)

64
00:02:32,070 --> 00:02:33,169
(When she was dejected about the hidden mission,)

65
00:02:33,170 --> 00:02:35,363
(the sweetest guy showed up.)

66
00:02:35,411 --> 00:02:37,780
(You've gotten prettier.)

67
00:02:37,781 --> 00:02:42,079
(Before she tried anything, Ji Suk cleared most of the list.)

68
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:45,049
(She was able to complete 3 out of 5 on the list.)

69
00:02:45,721 --> 00:02:47,859
(Having two tasks left for the mission, the steak is served.)

70
00:02:47,860 --> 00:02:49,608
It made me wonder if you ever said those before.

71
00:02:49,721 --> 00:02:52,488
I thought you were attractive and cute.

72
00:02:52,591 --> 00:02:55,025
- When the three of us had sashimi? - Yes.

73
00:02:55,730 --> 00:02:59,400
(It's because she needs the steak for the hidden mission.)

74
00:02:59,401 --> 00:03:00,870
I'm sorry, but could I get one more knife?

75
00:03:00,871 --> 00:03:02,739
(Asking a question all of a sudden)

76
00:03:02,740 --> 00:03:04,739
(She gets started on "getting him to cut her steak".)

77
00:03:04,740 --> 00:03:06,760
Me too. Wait, no. I have a knife.

78
00:03:07,540 --> 00:03:08,910
(You have a knife, but I don't.)

79
00:03:08,911 --> 00:03:10,039
They gave me one.

80
00:03:10,040 --> 00:03:11,869
(Staring)

81
00:03:12,381 --> 00:03:14,750
(Wait, So Min doesn't have a knife.)

82
00:03:14,751 --> 00:03:16,497
- It's over there. - I see.

83
00:03:18,221 --> 00:03:19,549
- Because you used it before? - Yes.

84
00:03:19,550 --> 00:03:20,989
(This sweet guy is very observant too.)

85
00:03:20,990 --> 00:03:24,359
(She starts her plan and waits for a new knife with a lame excuse.)

86
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:26,684
(She's silently pressuring him.)

87
00:03:27,260 --> 00:03:29,600
(This sweet guy is slow to figure out her cue.)

88
00:03:29,601 --> 00:03:33,307
(I don't have a knife.)

89
00:03:35,341 --> 00:03:37,188
- Do you want me to cut yours? - What?

90
00:03:37,670 --> 00:03:39,739
(Her plan works! He finally got it.)

91
00:03:39,740 --> 00:03:41,739
- Thank you. - I'll cut yours with the new knife.

92
00:03:41,740 --> 00:03:42,910
Thank you.

93
00:03:42,911 --> 00:03:43,910
(Her silent protest gets her desired answer.)

94
00:03:43,911 --> 00:03:45,264
- Thank you, Ji Suk. - Sure.

95
00:03:45,580 --> 00:03:47,268
Thank you. No one has ever done that.

96
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:49,220
- No way. - Seriously. No one did that for me.

97
00:03:49,221 --> 00:03:51,350
No one has ever cut steak for me in my life.

98
00:03:51,351 --> 00:03:52,361
(She finishes the fourth task too.)

99
00:03:52,820 --> 00:03:54,032
I'm serious.

100
00:03:54,221 --> 00:03:55,836
- So Min, I cut the steak, - Okay.

101
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:58,289
- but it looks ugly. Is that okay? - That's okay. Thank you.

102
00:03:58,290 --> 00:04:00,759
- Thank you. I can eat them. - Okay.

103
00:04:00,760 --> 00:04:02,799
You will... You will...

104
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:04,013
You'll feed me from there?

105
00:04:05,131 --> 00:04:06,569
(She's flustered.)

106
00:04:06,570 --> 00:04:07,639
(This sweet guy does a bonus task.)

107
00:04:07,640 --> 00:04:09,039
- Do you want the garlic? - Yes, I like it.

108
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:10,181
I love garlic.

109
00:04:10,570 --> 00:04:12,490
Great. All right.

110
00:04:14,711 --> 00:04:17,539
(The plane is taking off now.)

111
00:04:18,651 --> 00:04:19,924
Come on, what was that?

112
00:04:20,321 --> 00:04:23,080
(His sweet act is more than she can take in a day.)

113
00:04:23,081 --> 00:04:24,232
Come on.

114
00:04:24,690 --> 00:04:26,003
My gosh. Gosh.

115
00:04:26,690 --> 00:04:27,789
Thank you.

116
00:04:27,790 --> 00:04:28,831
Right there.

117
00:04:29,420 --> 00:04:30,460
Thank you.

118
00:04:30,461 --> 00:04:31,729
(Thanks to this sweet guy, she only has one task left.)

119
00:04:31,730 --> 00:04:33,306
This is so hard. Anyway...

120
00:04:34,161 --> 00:04:35,372
This is good.

121
00:04:35,401 --> 00:04:36,542
This is really good.

122
00:04:37,370 --> 00:04:40,471
Anyway, we should talk about jealousy and heart fluttering.

123
00:04:43,370 --> 00:04:45,492
- That came out of nowhere. - Yes.

124
00:04:45,540 --> 00:04:46,570
Okay.

125
00:04:46,571 --> 00:04:49,408
I don't remember what I said.

126
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:51,580
Sang Yeob kept telling me...

127
00:04:51,581 --> 00:04:52,793
Why are you bringing him up again?

128
00:04:53,781 --> 00:04:54,950
Why did you bring him up?

129
00:04:54,951 --> 00:04:57,590
I asked that only because I wanted to hear something.

130
00:04:57,591 --> 00:04:58,701
Like...

131
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:00,520
how he felt about that.

132
00:05:00,521 --> 00:05:01,702
(I'm curious about that.)

133
00:05:02,261 --> 00:05:03,847
- What? - How I felt?

134
00:05:04,161 --> 00:05:05,260
Gosh, you know.

135
00:05:05,261 --> 00:05:06,390
He said he felt something.

136
00:05:06,391 --> 00:05:08,118
He felt something of us.

137
00:05:08,901 --> 00:05:11,830
(He felt something of us?)

138
00:05:11,831 --> 00:05:14,970
- He felt we were affectionate? - No.

139
00:05:14,971 --> 00:05:17,039
(That's not it.)

140
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:19,869
(While So Min is trying hard to get him to say the word, "jealous"...)

141
00:05:20,341 --> 00:05:21,410
I think we have to hurry.

142
00:05:21,411 --> 00:05:22,551
So Min!

143
00:05:23,511 --> 00:05:25,772
My gosh, I bet that's expensive. This is terrible.

144
00:05:26,380 --> 00:05:27,866
Hey, they had steaks.

145
00:05:28,281 --> 00:05:29,997
It's a poem. Is it "poet"?

146
00:05:30,151 --> 00:05:31,363
- What? - Poem?

147
00:05:31,951 --> 00:05:33,049
P-O-E-T.

148
00:05:33,050 --> 00:05:34,939
- There's no T here. - It's the poem.

149
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:37,660
- What does "poet" mean? - This is the poem.

150
00:05:37,661 --> 00:05:38,843
Don't you know it means, "poem"?

151
00:05:40,300 --> 00:05:41,543
I see. "Poet" as "poem".

152
00:05:42,601 --> 00:05:45,096
I can't participate in this discussion at all.

153
00:05:45,230 --> 00:05:46,299
This is driving me crazy.

154
00:05:46,300 --> 00:05:47,499
I'm not sure about that.

155
00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:49,239
- I can't do it. You hurt my ego. - It could be simple.

156
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:50,524
- Could it be, L-O-V-E? - Hey.

157
00:05:51,670 --> 00:05:52,739
L-O-V-E?

158
00:05:52,740 --> 00:05:54,309
(Since the poem was about love, is the password "love"?)

159
00:05:54,310 --> 00:05:57,543
(They can make the word, "love". Will it open with "love"?)

160
00:05:57,851 --> 00:05:59,023
"Love" is not it.

161
00:05:59,810 --> 00:06:01,049
My gosh. Seriously.

162
00:06:01,050 --> 00:06:02,091
(What is the password then?)

163
00:06:02,180 --> 00:06:04,090
Where did So Min go?

164
00:06:04,091 --> 00:06:05,130
(Where did she go when she wrote that?)

165
00:06:05,151 --> 00:06:06,220
- Japan. - Where in Japan?

166
00:06:06,221 --> 00:06:07,320
She went to Sapporo.

167
00:06:07,321 --> 00:06:08,875
(She went to Sapporo when she wrote the poem.)

168
00:06:08,990 --> 00:06:10,879
Would "Sapporo" work for that?

169
00:06:11,591 --> 00:06:14,260
(Since she wrote it in Sapporo, is the password Sapporo?)

170
00:06:14,261 --> 00:06:17,129
- The password might be simple. - Try "Sapporo".

171
00:06:18,401 --> 00:06:19,845
O-O-R-O.

172
00:06:20,271 --> 00:06:21,439
No, O.

173
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:23,439
(Will it work this time?)

174
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:25,570
(It's the sound of the safe opening.)

175
00:06:25,571 --> 00:06:26,939
("Sapporo" was the password.)

176
00:06:26,940 --> 00:06:28,758
- It was really "Sapporo"? - You're a genius!

177
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:30,410
(Haha achieves a splendid feat.)

178
00:06:30,411 --> 00:06:32,229
It was Sapporo where she wrote the poem.

179
00:06:32,250 --> 00:06:33,391
- My gosh. - Something is in there.

180
00:06:33,451 --> 00:06:34,490
What's that?

181
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:36,333
- It's a scroll. - What's that?

182
00:06:36,721 --> 00:06:37,850
We'll use these?

183
00:06:37,851 --> 00:06:39,708
I guess we have to use the lantern to read the scroll.

184
00:06:39,750 --> 00:06:41,059
We can read with the lantern.

185
00:06:41,060 --> 00:06:42,059
- "Hope shines..." - Right there.

186
00:06:42,060 --> 00:06:43,289
"in the darkest moment."

187
00:06:43,290 --> 00:06:46,563
(Hope shines in the darkest moment.)

188
00:06:46,790 --> 00:06:49,499
(Wait, what does this mean?)

189
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:52,729
(And a mysterious lantern is next to the scroll.)

190
00:06:52,730 --> 00:06:54,369
- My gosh, this... - We have to use that to read it.

191
00:06:54,370 --> 00:06:55,754
- We have to use that. - The drawing.

192
00:06:55,971 --> 00:06:57,051
- Gosh. - It's working.

193
00:06:57,170 --> 00:06:58,270
No, no.

194
00:06:58,271 --> 00:07:00,230
- Jae Seok. It's not that. - Why don't you shine it here?

195
00:07:00,271 --> 00:07:02,210
- We have to turn off the lights. - We must turn off the lights.

196
00:07:02,211 --> 00:07:04,679
- Turn off the lights. - "Power off"!

197
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:06,210
(There's a power-off button underneath the safe?)

198
00:07:06,211 --> 00:07:08,503
- This is it. - Yes, we must turn off the lights!

199
00:07:08,521 --> 00:07:10,944
(About 30 minutes ago)

200
00:07:11,651 --> 00:07:15,119
(Even Kwang Soo with long arms...)

201
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:19,030
(wasn't able to reach the power-off button.)

202
00:07:19,031 --> 00:07:24,020
(It seems they must use the toy car and the remote to press the button.)

203
00:07:24,531 --> 00:07:26,200
(Hold on. This...)

204
00:07:26,201 --> 00:07:29,739
(However, they couldn't drive it as they were out of batteries.)

205
00:07:29,740 --> 00:07:32,539
(But there was a lantern in the safe?)

206
00:07:32,540 --> 00:07:34,379
- We'll use the batteries here. - I see. We'll use these?

207
00:07:34,380 --> 00:07:36,140
We'll take them out and put them in the car.

208
00:07:36,141 --> 00:07:38,210
- That's right. This is it. - Let's do that first.

209
00:07:38,211 --> 00:07:39,897
(They insert the batteries into the toy car.)

210
00:07:40,380 --> 00:07:41,795
- My gosh. - We'll use that.

211
00:07:41,880 --> 00:07:43,950
They came up with quite an exquisite set-up.

212
00:07:43,951 --> 00:07:45,789
- Whom are you talking to? - What?

213
00:07:45,790 --> 00:07:47,119
You're supposed to talk to us.

214
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:48,890
- You should talk to us. - He did that from time to time.

215
00:07:48,891 --> 00:07:50,429
- The producer is over there. - Unbelievable.

216
00:07:50,430 --> 00:07:52,559
- The producer is over there. - My gosh. Seriously.

217
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:54,177
Why are you flattering him throughout the game?

218
00:07:55,901 --> 00:07:57,499
- Flatter? - I was just looking at him.

219
00:07:57,500 --> 00:07:59,470
- People won't know, but he's there. - Put it in front of the safe.

220
00:07:59,471 --> 00:08:00,770
- Try it. - It's ready now.

221
00:08:00,771 --> 00:08:02,140
(Meanwhile, they finish putting in the batteries.)

222
00:08:02,141 --> 00:08:04,010
There you go. I knew it.

223
00:08:04,011 --> 00:08:05,486
- Here it goes. - It worked.

224
00:08:06,471 --> 00:08:07,479
(Crashing)

225
00:08:07,480 --> 00:08:08,939
- A little... - The lights are off.

226
00:08:08,940 --> 00:08:10,122
(The lights are off when the button is pressed.)

227
00:08:10,281 --> 00:08:12,780
Where is the lantern? Where is it?

228
00:08:12,781 --> 00:08:14,296
- The car has the batteries. - We must do it later.

229
00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:15,479
- The lights are off. - We need the batteries.

230
00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:16,834
- Back up the car. - Did you take them out?

231
00:08:17,290 --> 00:08:18,390
Take out the batteries.

232
00:08:18,391 --> 00:08:20,340
- Take out the batteries. - I know how to take them out.

233
00:08:20,351 --> 00:08:22,713
I know this because I've been to a lot of escape rooms.

234
00:08:22,821 --> 00:08:24,760
The clues will be either on the paintings...

235
00:08:24,761 --> 00:08:26,175
or the walls.

236
00:08:26,430 --> 00:08:29,429
(Hope shines in the darkest moment.)

237
00:08:29,430 --> 00:08:30,900
Nightglow is the only thing that lights up in the dark.

238
00:08:30,901 --> 00:08:32,830
Yes, that's the only thing.

239
00:08:32,831 --> 00:08:34,970
Then something must glow in the dark here.

240
00:08:34,971 --> 00:08:36,183
- Something glows in the dark? - Look around.

241
00:08:36,301 --> 00:08:38,795
(Something glows in the dark?)

242
00:08:39,971 --> 00:08:41,092
This is it.

243
00:08:41,380 --> 00:08:42,540
This glows in the dark.

244
00:08:42,541 --> 00:08:44,050
(This is it. This glows in the dark.)

245
00:08:44,051 --> 00:08:45,210
(Something is on the wall Ji Hyo was looking at?)

246
00:08:45,211 --> 00:08:46,796
- That's it. - What is it?

247
00:08:47,321 --> 00:08:49,099
- This glows in the dark. - This is it.

248
00:08:49,951 --> 00:08:51,505
- Is it glowing? - Yes, it glows.

249
00:08:52,421 --> 00:08:53,835
- The lights are back on. - What's going on?

250
00:08:54,490 --> 00:08:55,659
(The lights are turned on when they touch the frame.)

251
00:08:55,660 --> 00:08:56,790
This must be it.

252
00:08:56,791 --> 00:08:58,659
When will we find So Min at this rate?

253
00:08:58,660 --> 00:08:59,843
(Is there a secret in this painting?)

254
00:09:00,601 --> 00:09:02,722
This... Is this the only clue?

255
00:09:02,801 --> 00:09:03,899
Something is written there.

256
00:09:03,900 --> 00:09:06,224
- This is it. It's English! - That's it.

257
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:09,896
(What? What's on the painting?)

258
00:09:11,711 --> 00:09:13,710
("NIMOS" is written on the bottom of the painting.)

259
00:09:13,711 --> 00:09:15,080
"NIMOS".

260
00:09:15,081 --> 00:09:17,149
(This brings them to think...)

261
00:09:17,150 --> 00:09:21,119
(Five English letters are needed for the lock on the entrance door.)

262
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:22,320
(Then is "NIMOS" their last password?)

263
00:09:22,321 --> 00:09:23,937
They're in this building.

264
00:09:24,051 --> 00:09:25,950
- They finished eating. - It's M-O-S.

265
00:09:25,951 --> 00:09:28,749
(Awesome! We found the password, NIMOS.)

266
00:09:29,591 --> 00:09:31,246
I put it in, but it won't open.

267
00:09:31,961 --> 00:09:35,434
(But the lock won't open with the password.)

268
00:09:35,701 --> 00:09:37,869
(And at that time,)

269
00:09:37,870 --> 00:09:42,041
(So Min is still trying to accomplish the last task.)

270
00:09:42,341 --> 00:09:45,570
- I'll give you a quiz now. - Okay.

271
00:09:45,571 --> 00:09:48,237
If you don't answer it in 30 seconds, you can't eat that.

272
00:09:48,441 --> 00:09:49,739
- Okay. - All right.

273
00:09:49,740 --> 00:09:52,779
On the day of our press conference and first team dinner for the drama,

274
00:09:52,780 --> 00:09:55,249
after seeing how close I was with Sang Yeob,

275
00:09:55,250 --> 00:09:56,997
you said this.

276
00:09:59,390 --> 00:10:00,389
(Thinking)

277
00:10:00,390 --> 00:10:01,489
My gosh...

278
00:10:01,490 --> 00:10:02,530
(What did I say?)

279
00:10:02,821 --> 00:10:05,557
(Please tell me that you were jealous.)

280
00:10:07,701 --> 00:10:08,899
"I'm jealous."

281
00:10:08,900 --> 00:10:10,460
(He finally says the magic word!)

282
00:10:10,461 --> 00:10:12,269
- Correct! - I already said that.

283
00:10:12,270 --> 00:10:14,600
So Min, you completed your mission.

284
00:10:14,601 --> 00:10:17,873
(So Min, you completed your mission.)

285
00:10:19,410 --> 00:10:20,996
You were doing a mission just now?

286
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:22,322
Yes.

287
00:10:22,841 --> 00:10:24,810
You wouldn't say that,

288
00:10:24,811 --> 00:10:26,050
so it was so hard.

289
00:10:26,051 --> 00:10:28,071
It was to get me to say all those things.

290
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:30,220
No, that's not true. It's not true.

291
00:10:30,221 --> 00:10:31,450
Please. It's not what you think.

292
00:10:31,451 --> 00:10:32,590
- What was that? - It's love.

293
00:10:32,591 --> 00:10:34,813
- Were you acting the whole time? - No, no.

294
00:10:34,990 --> 00:10:37,617
That's why you kept acting awkward.

295
00:10:37,791 --> 00:10:40,129
We can't get caught. If they catch us, we can't go on dates.

296
00:10:40,130 --> 00:10:41,560
- We have to run. Hurry. - So Min.

297
00:10:41,561 --> 00:10:42,671
This was all for the show.

298
00:10:42,801 --> 00:10:44,670
- Hey, I'm so disappointed! - No, it's not that.

299
00:10:44,671 --> 00:10:45,729
I'm so disappointed.

300
00:10:45,730 --> 00:10:47,822
If we don't do this, I have to pay for everything.

301
00:10:48,041 --> 00:10:49,819
- Really? - Yes. We can't get caught.

302
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,656
We have to be on the run no matter what.

303
00:10:51,811 --> 00:10:52,952
Let's go.

304
00:10:53,010 --> 00:10:54,960
Hold on. Do I put S on this side?

305
00:10:55,140 --> 00:10:56,251
Does it start from here?

306
00:10:56,811 --> 00:10:59,205
No, it's N and I.

307
00:10:59,280 --> 00:11:01,149
It spells "So Min" backwards!

308
00:11:01,150 --> 00:11:02,180
- "So Min"! - You're right!

309
00:11:02,181 --> 00:11:03,320
(Jong Kook realizes something.)

310
00:11:03,321 --> 00:11:07,090
(If you read it backwards, it's "So Min".)

311
00:11:07,091 --> 00:11:09,586
It spells "So Min" backwards!

312
00:11:10,691 --> 00:11:12,790
S, O, M, I, N. Yes!

313
00:11:12,791 --> 00:11:14,215
(It was an easy one.)

314
00:11:14,530 --> 00:11:16,499
(At the same moment,)

315
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:19,661
(So Min and Ji Suk are still in the room.)

316
00:11:20,030 --> 00:11:22,540
(Once he puts in the passcode...)

317
00:11:22,541 --> 00:11:23,940
- It worked! - Good!

318
00:11:23,941 --> 00:11:25,325
- NIMOS. - NIMOS.

319
00:11:25,841 --> 00:11:28,210
(They finally go to where So Min is.)

320
00:11:28,211 --> 00:11:29,840
- We need to go up. - No.

321
00:11:29,841 --> 00:11:31,871
I smell the food. They were upstairs.

322
00:11:32,280 --> 00:11:33,749
How did you get it?

323
00:11:33,750 --> 00:11:35,497
- It spells "So Min" backwards? - Yes.

324
00:11:36,250 --> 00:11:38,690
- It was broadcast live. - We came to the right place.

325
00:11:38,691 --> 00:11:39,790
Right?

326
00:11:39,791 --> 00:11:41,174
(Will So Min and Ji Suk get caught?)

327
00:11:41,461 --> 00:11:43,690
- We were late. - This is the right place.

328
00:11:43,691 --> 00:11:44,740
(They left already.)

329
00:11:44,931 --> 00:11:47,029
- Oh, no. - They ate our food.

330
00:11:47,030 --> 00:11:48,259
It was our money.

331
00:11:48,260 --> 00:11:49,999
- They ate everything. - You're right.

332
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,729
- This looks expensive. - You're right.

333
00:11:51,730 --> 00:11:53,100
(What happened to So Min and Ji Suk?)

334
00:11:53,101 --> 00:11:55,192
(3 minutes ago)

335
00:11:55,841 --> 00:11:57,540
(Just before the members reached the staircase,)

336
00:11:57,541 --> 00:11:59,769
(they made a successful escape.)

337
00:11:59,770 --> 00:12:01,123
Where should we go?

338
00:12:01,681 --> 00:12:03,139
Do we get in?

339
00:12:03,140 --> 00:12:05,050
- We need to run away. - Finally...

340
00:12:05,051 --> 00:12:06,149
Let's go.

341
00:12:06,150 --> 00:12:07,363
Let's go.

342
00:12:08,120 --> 00:12:09,580
- Who should pay? - 30.

343
00:12:09,581 --> 00:12:11,320
(They need to pick a member.)

344
00:12:11,321 --> 00:12:12,320
Se Chan.

345
00:12:12,321 --> 00:12:13,420
Why?

346
00:12:13,421 --> 00:12:16,119
- You were in the same troop. - Yes.

347
00:12:16,120 --> 00:12:19,090
I want to see him panic.

348
00:12:19,860 --> 00:12:21,529
We need to find them once again.

349
00:12:21,530 --> 00:12:24,257
- Yes. - They already left this place.

350
00:12:24,931 --> 00:12:27,200
- We need to search again? - Yes.

351
00:12:27,201 --> 00:12:28,499
- Gosh. - Where should we go next?

352
00:12:28,500 --> 00:12:31,769
They had a date here, and now, they're on the move.

353
00:12:31,770 --> 00:12:33,054
- Hello. - My goodness.

354
00:12:33,370 --> 00:12:36,040
- Since they have already left, - Yes.

355
00:12:36,041 --> 00:12:37,525
- Se Chan, - Yes?

356
00:12:37,711 --> 00:12:39,050
you should pay.

357
00:12:39,051 --> 00:12:40,580
- You need to pay. - It's for you.

358
00:12:40,581 --> 00:12:43,019
(Se Chan will pay for the 1st round.)

359
00:12:43,020 --> 00:12:44,050
It's for you.

360
00:12:44,051 --> 00:12:45,435
(Dumbfounded)

361
00:12:46,051 --> 00:12:48,190
- We need to pay every time. - They picked Se Chan.

362
00:12:48,191 --> 00:12:49,675
- But... - Pay up.

363
00:12:49,721 --> 00:12:50,790
Bring your card.

364
00:12:50,791 --> 00:12:52,460
- How much is it? - It's...

365
00:12:52,461 --> 00:12:54,060
- How much is it? - It's not that cheap.

366
00:12:54,061 --> 00:12:55,413
Right, this is a restaurant.

367
00:12:55,760 --> 00:12:56,930
(Glancing)

368
00:12:56,931 --> 00:12:58,587
- How much is it? - They ate a lot.

369
00:12:58,671 --> 00:13:00,499
- I will find them no matter what. - All right.

370
00:13:00,500 --> 00:13:01,869
- Let's go. - Okay.

371
00:13:01,870 --> 00:13:03,600
- We need to stop them. - Let's go.

372
00:13:03,601 --> 00:13:05,358
Let's hurry and catch her.

373
00:13:07,880 --> 00:13:09,021
Go faster.

374
00:13:09,211 --> 00:13:10,827
We need to run away.

375
00:13:10,951 --> 00:13:13,476
If you get caught, do you need to pay for everything?

376
00:13:13,811 --> 00:13:16,477
You got something on your face again.

377
00:13:17,421 --> 00:13:18,704
My mission is over.

378
00:13:19,990 --> 00:13:21,778
You looked so awkward back there.

379
00:13:22,360 --> 00:13:24,290
My goodness.

380
00:13:24,291 --> 00:13:25,301
(She always gets stuff on her face.)

381
00:13:26,561 --> 00:13:28,985
Forget my pretentious attitude back there.

382
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:32,262
I'm serious. I'm not joking. Please believe me.

383
00:13:33,431 --> 00:13:35,070
We'll be on the sixth floor.

384
00:13:35,071 --> 00:13:36,470
It can't be boxing, right?

385
00:13:36,471 --> 00:13:38,470
(They arrive at their next destination.)

386
00:13:38,471 --> 00:13:39,869
(Sighing)

387
00:13:39,870 --> 00:13:41,962
I'm right. I was.

388
00:13:42,581 --> 00:13:43,840
Oh, no.

389
00:13:43,841 --> 00:13:45,050
(They're given dancing costumes and a stage.)

390
00:13:45,051 --> 00:13:46,262
I don't want to go inside.

391
00:13:46,780 --> 00:13:48,450
We don't know the genre yet.

392
00:13:48,451 --> 00:13:49,461
Dan Ji.

393
00:13:49,821 --> 00:13:51,249
(It's a familiar voice.)

394
00:13:51,250 --> 00:13:52,705
Lee Yi Kyung!

395
00:13:53,250 --> 00:13:56,290
(He is her second date who has been waiting for her.)

396
00:13:56,291 --> 00:13:57,690
Lee Yi Kyung!

397
00:13:57,691 --> 00:13:58,889
Come here now!

398
00:13:58,890 --> 00:14:01,183
(Lee Yi Kyung, the innocent boy)

399
00:14:01,801 --> 00:14:04,830
(When acting, he shows the manly side of him.)

400
00:14:04,831 --> 00:14:07,570
(But in front of So Min, he's just a young boy in love.)

401
00:14:07,571 --> 00:14:11,009
- Yes. - This is Lee Yi Kyung.

402
00:14:11,010 --> 00:14:12,070
It's been a while.

403
00:14:12,071 --> 00:14:14,180
(Startled)

404
00:14:14,181 --> 00:14:16,100
(He gives her a flower.)

405
00:14:16,441 --> 00:14:18,180
- What was that? - I heard that...

406
00:14:18,181 --> 00:14:19,595
she likes tulips.

407
00:14:19,780 --> 00:14:20,979
I remembered.

408
00:14:20,980 --> 00:14:23,050
Yi Kyung, thank you so much.

409
00:14:23,051 --> 00:14:25,313
- Don't mention it. - Thanks a lot.

410
00:14:26,051 --> 00:14:28,090
- You're a grown man now. - You see,

411
00:14:28,091 --> 00:14:30,686
we met when I was still quite young.

412
00:14:30,961 --> 00:14:32,190
But I'm all grown up now.

413
00:14:32,191 --> 00:14:33,930
- Am I your rival? - Let me get in between you.

414
00:14:33,931 --> 00:14:35,159
(Ji Suk comes in between.)

415
00:14:35,160 --> 00:14:37,399
(I can't accept this.)

416
00:14:37,400 --> 00:14:38,769
Yi Kyung, I'm so happy to see you.

417
00:14:38,770 --> 00:14:39,869
Come over here.

418
00:14:39,870 --> 00:14:42,598
(He pulls her towards him.)

419
00:14:42,841 --> 00:14:43,970
I'm so happy to see you.

420
00:14:43,971 --> 00:14:45,152
So Min.

421
00:14:45,341 --> 00:14:46,670
It's been a long time.

422
00:14:46,671 --> 00:14:47,940
(Suddenly, it's a love triangle.)

423
00:14:47,941 --> 00:14:49,860
I'm getting jealous. I am.

424
00:14:50,081 --> 00:14:51,928
I'm getting jealous!

425
00:14:52,780 --> 00:14:54,519
(I finally understand how it feels to be jealous.)

426
00:14:54,520 --> 00:14:57,208
- You should've hugged me sooner. - I'm so jealous!

427
00:14:57,520 --> 00:14:59,290
We had a date just now.

428
00:14:59,291 --> 00:15:00,590
What did you do?

429
00:15:00,591 --> 00:15:01,920
- We... - It's a secret.

430
00:15:01,921 --> 00:15:03,820
- It is a secret. - I want to know!

431
00:15:03,821 --> 00:15:05,104
(He won't tell.)

432
00:15:05,730 --> 00:15:07,229
(It's a war of nerves.)

433
00:15:07,230 --> 00:15:08,342
It's a secret.

434
00:15:08,500 --> 00:15:11,129
This is the best birthday I've ever had.

435
00:15:11,130 --> 00:15:12,229
- All right. - This feels great.

436
00:15:12,230 --> 00:15:14,769
This time, you will learn...

437
00:15:14,770 --> 00:15:16,999
how to tango with these two men.

438
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,991
(Have the Last Tango With Me)

439
00:15:19,541 --> 00:15:21,509
- You'll succeed once you get... - Tango?

440
00:15:21,510 --> 00:15:23,762
- all the moves correct. - Tango?

441
00:15:23,841 --> 00:15:27,249
But after So Min learns the dance,

442
00:15:27,250 --> 00:15:30,220
she needs to pick one of you to become her partner.

443
00:15:30,221 --> 00:15:32,050
(She will choose one person.)

444
00:15:32,051 --> 00:15:34,050
- Oh, no. - What about the other one?

445
00:15:34,051 --> 00:15:35,590
She'll pick the one she can dance better with.

446
00:15:35,591 --> 00:15:37,629
The one that doesn't get chosen...

447
00:15:37,630 --> 00:15:39,529
will be eliminated.

448
00:15:39,530 --> 00:15:42,560
(One of the two men will be eliminated mid-race.)

449
00:15:42,760 --> 00:15:44,060
- Really? - Oh, no.

450
00:15:44,061 --> 00:15:45,229
What should I do?

451
00:15:45,230 --> 00:15:47,330
The members are chasing after you...

452
00:15:47,331 --> 00:15:48,970
- as we speak. - They are?

453
00:15:48,971 --> 00:15:51,909
- We need to hurry. - You must learn quickly.

454
00:15:51,910 --> 00:15:53,122
We need to hurry.

455
00:15:53,240 --> 00:15:54,580
After you change,

456
00:15:54,581 --> 00:15:56,379
you will learn the tango.

457
00:15:56,380 --> 00:15:57,440
Okay.

458
00:15:57,441 --> 00:15:58,879
I've never tangoed before.

459
00:15:58,880 --> 00:16:00,467
- What should I do? - I'm worried.

460
00:16:00,681 --> 00:16:02,498
I'll be eliminated for sure.

461
00:16:02,650 --> 00:16:04,338
Don't say that.

462
00:16:04,951 --> 00:16:06,350
Hello.

463
00:16:06,351 --> 00:16:07,659
- Hello. - Hello.

464
00:16:07,660 --> 00:16:10,159
We're professional dancers.

465
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:12,887
- I'm Kim Jin Woong. - I'm Kang Se Na.

466
00:16:13,191 --> 00:16:15,300
- Hello. - It's nice to meet you.

467
00:16:15,301 --> 00:16:19,200
But you see, we don't know anything about tango.

468
00:16:19,201 --> 00:16:20,700
Do you think we can still dance?

469
00:16:20,701 --> 00:16:22,470
Compared to other genres, tango is more...

470
00:16:22,471 --> 00:16:24,310
- of a walking dance. - Is it?

471
00:16:24,311 --> 00:16:26,340
I'm sure you can follow.

472
00:16:26,341 --> 00:16:28,739
All of their costumes look so pretty.

473
00:16:28,740 --> 00:16:30,440
Look at him.

474
00:16:30,441 --> 00:16:31,749
(Everyone's clothes look nice except for...)

475
00:16:31,750 --> 00:16:33,550
(Ji Suk's tight costume.)

476
00:16:33,551 --> 00:16:35,450
This top goes all the way down...

477
00:16:35,451 --> 00:16:36,835
to my legs.

478
00:16:36,951 --> 00:16:38,590
So it's a bit tight.

479
00:16:38,591 --> 00:16:40,190
(His entire body is squeezed inside the tights.)

480
00:16:40,191 --> 00:16:41,619
I actually want to wear that.

481
00:16:41,620 --> 00:16:42,619
Really?

482
00:16:42,620 --> 00:16:45,359
- I already look like a dancer. - I've never worn such a dress.

483
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:47,129
- Goodness, So Min. - Goodness.

484
00:16:47,130 --> 00:16:48,460
(Her red dress makes her look sexy.)

485
00:16:48,461 --> 00:16:50,460
I've never seen you in such an outfit.

486
00:16:50,461 --> 00:16:51,729
(You look like...)

487
00:16:51,730 --> 00:16:55,170
You look like a true tango dancer.

488
00:16:55,171 --> 00:16:56,686
- Really? - You do.

489
00:16:58,341 --> 00:16:59,509
You look so pretty.

490
00:16:59,510 --> 00:17:00,710
(He's good with words.)

491
00:17:00,711 --> 00:17:02,580
Can you play some music?

492
00:17:02,581 --> 00:17:03,620
(He decides to dance.)

493
00:17:04,140 --> 00:17:05,609
That's great.

494
00:17:05,610 --> 00:17:08,478
Although I've never learned tango before...

495
00:17:09,150 --> 00:17:10,850
That's awesome. Show me.

496
00:17:10,851 --> 00:17:12,119
(He's a tough match.)

497
00:17:12,120 --> 00:17:13,262
Let me see.

498
00:17:13,450 --> 00:17:14,590
(What kind of music will it be?)

499
00:17:14,591 --> 00:17:16,076
I'm a bit...

500
00:17:16,890 --> 00:17:20,295
(They all recognize this song.)

501
00:17:21,001 --> 00:17:22,030
(It's So Min's favorite song.)

502
00:17:22,031 --> 00:17:23,141
This is...

503
00:17:25,271 --> 00:17:26,500
(Flustered)

504
00:17:26,501 --> 00:17:27,570
Hold on.

505
00:17:27,571 --> 00:17:29,258
(He starts dancing.)

506
00:17:30,140 --> 00:17:33,340
(His dance moves are groovy.)

507
00:17:33,341 --> 00:17:34,724
(He's good.)

508
00:17:35,981 --> 00:17:37,080
(Afterwards,)

509
00:17:37,081 --> 00:17:40,443
(he freezes in a cute way.)

510
00:17:40,981 --> 00:17:43,202
(It's funny but charming at the same time.)

511
00:17:43,981 --> 00:17:46,149
(He squirms.)

512
00:17:46,150 --> 00:17:48,009
You already know how to dance.

513
00:17:48,660 --> 00:17:51,892
(He does the worm dance.)

514
00:17:52,660 --> 00:17:54,459
You know how to dance.

515
00:17:54,460 --> 00:17:56,800
(I can dance too.)

516
00:17:56,801 --> 00:17:59,255
(Suddenly, it becomes a couple dance.)

517
00:17:59,771 --> 00:18:01,540
(They squirm together.)

518
00:18:01,541 --> 00:18:03,661
(They're a perfect match for each other.)

519
00:18:03,841 --> 00:18:05,169
That's it.

520
00:18:05,170 --> 00:18:06,887
(Was it all right, So Min?)

521
00:18:07,680 --> 00:18:09,879
I liked it!

522
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:11,280
I don't know much about tango, though.

523
00:18:11,281 --> 00:18:13,372
- He was good to begin with. - I need to watch you dance too,

524
00:18:13,610 --> 00:18:15,250
- Ji Suk. - He's way too good.

525
00:18:15,251 --> 00:18:16,250
- You're too good. - Let's see it.

526
00:18:16,251 --> 00:18:17,419
Show us.

527
00:18:17,420 --> 00:18:19,419
Play a more upbeat song.

528
00:18:19,420 --> 00:18:20,449
Play me anything.

529
00:18:20,450 --> 00:18:22,309
You can play the same song.

530
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:25,011
I'm a bit flustered.

531
00:18:26,890 --> 00:18:28,749
His outfit has already won some points.

532
00:18:29,601 --> 00:18:32,126
(His outfit makes him look like a passionate dancer.)

533
00:18:32,501 --> 00:18:35,469
(Squirming)

534
00:18:35,771 --> 00:18:38,340
(Ironically, he shows off some adorable dance moves.)

535
00:18:38,341 --> 00:18:39,810
You look cute.

536
00:18:39,811 --> 00:18:41,280
You're very adorable.

537
00:18:41,281 --> 00:18:42,352
(She likes it.)

538
00:18:43,380 --> 00:18:45,350
(You're mine, So Min.)

539
00:18:45,351 --> 00:18:46,949
You dance like this.

540
00:18:46,950 --> 00:18:48,335
(You're cute.)

541
00:18:48,751 --> 00:18:51,245
(Don't be fooled by him!)

542
00:18:52,150 --> 00:18:55,359
(Would you like to dance with me?)

543
00:18:55,360 --> 00:18:57,280
(Twirling)

544
00:18:58,291 --> 00:19:00,760
(After a smooth spin,)

545
00:19:00,761 --> 00:19:05,882
(he charms her even more with a powerful twist.)

546
00:19:06,900 --> 00:19:09,223
(They seem to be getting along too well.)

547
00:19:10,101 --> 00:19:12,240
(So Min, pick me.)

548
00:19:12,241 --> 00:19:13,452
Thank you.

549
00:19:13,870 --> 00:19:15,325
That was nice.

550
00:19:15,811 --> 00:19:17,179
That was awesome.

551
00:19:17,180 --> 00:19:18,949
Your styles are different. Yi Kyung is more hip-hop.

552
00:19:18,950 --> 00:19:20,550
I don't know Ji Suk's genre.

553
00:19:20,551 --> 00:19:22,080
You did well.

554
00:19:22,081 --> 00:19:24,219
(Whom will So Min pick?)

555
00:19:24,220 --> 00:19:26,020
Now, we will show you...

556
00:19:26,021 --> 00:19:28,819
- the choreography. - All right.

557
00:19:29,420 --> 00:19:31,784
(They anticipate.)

558
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:37,501
(They start off by gently holding each other's hands.)

559
00:19:37,561 --> 00:19:40,530
(It's a sentimental separation...)

560
00:19:40,531 --> 00:19:44,237
(followed by a passionate reunion.)

561
00:19:44,710 --> 00:19:45,840
I'm getting goosebumps.

562
00:19:45,841 --> 00:19:46,939
(It's only beautiful to watch.)

563
00:19:46,940 --> 00:19:47,950
We have to do that.

564
00:19:48,841 --> 00:19:51,173
(She suddenly flips her hair.)

565
00:19:51,450 --> 00:19:54,010
I'm not flexible enough to bend backwards like that.

566
00:19:54,011 --> 00:19:55,232
(They push and pull as if they're in a relationship.)

567
00:19:55,920 --> 00:19:57,679
(They rely on each other...)

568
00:19:57,680 --> 00:20:00,590
(and passionately march backwards.)

569
00:20:00,591 --> 00:20:02,090
It's so amazing.

570
00:20:02,091 --> 00:20:03,231
(They follow it up with a passionate head shake.)

571
00:20:03,720 --> 00:20:05,649
(How do we do that?)

572
00:20:06,531 --> 00:20:10,701
(In every cautious step they take lies their fervent love.)

573
00:20:10,900 --> 00:20:12,445
It's too hard.

574
00:20:14,331 --> 00:20:15,500
(She walks away coldheartedly...)

575
00:20:15,501 --> 00:20:16,600
It's amazing.

576
00:20:16,601 --> 00:20:17,969
(but comes back once again.)

577
00:20:17,970 --> 00:20:19,770
(They gaze at each other.)

578
00:20:19,771 --> 00:20:24,356
(This is tango, a dance for lovers.)

579
00:20:25,281 --> 00:20:26,649
(It's a lovely finale.)

580
00:20:26,650 --> 00:20:27,863
That's their finale.

581
00:20:29,680 --> 00:20:31,149
(It is indeed mesmerizing.)

582
00:20:31,150 --> 00:20:32,231
How do we do that?

583
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:34,119
This is a problem.

584
00:20:34,120 --> 00:20:35,490
(They can only escape if they master it.)

585
00:20:35,491 --> 00:20:37,439
I got goosebumps, watching you dance.

586
00:20:37,491 --> 00:20:39,859
But it's frightening to think that we'll have to do it.

587
00:20:39,860 --> 00:20:42,183
(Will they be able to run away from Team Chasers?)

588
00:20:43,061 --> 00:20:44,359
Goodness, So Min.

589
00:20:44,360 --> 00:20:46,553
Where did she go this time?

590
00:20:46,870 --> 00:20:48,456
- It's not here. - It's over here.

591
00:20:48,541 --> 00:20:50,100
- What is that? - What is it?

592
00:20:50,101 --> 00:20:51,570
You dance here.

593
00:20:51,571 --> 00:20:52,869
- It is. - Really?

594
00:20:52,870 --> 00:20:53,869
That's out of the blue.

595
00:20:53,870 --> 00:20:54,890
Hold on.

596
00:20:54,910 --> 00:20:57,510
- It's fancy. - When can we meet her?

597
00:20:57,511 --> 00:20:58,909
What kind of date could they have here?

598
00:20:58,910 --> 00:21:00,879
Where is she right now?

599
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:02,820
- Look over there. - That's So Min.

600
00:21:02,821 --> 00:21:04,219
(What lead have they found?)

601
00:21:04,220 --> 00:21:06,169
I guess So Min danced.

602
00:21:06,690 --> 00:21:08,359
- There's a guy. - That was their date.

603
00:21:08,360 --> 00:21:10,719
- I see. - Look at how close they got.

604
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:11,859
That's Ji Suk.

605
00:21:11,860 --> 00:21:13,330
- It'll feel different. - Right.

606
00:21:13,331 --> 00:21:14,573
Someone else is there.

607
00:21:14,630 --> 00:21:16,459
That's Lee Yi Kyung!

608
00:21:16,460 --> 00:21:17,459
That's him?

609
00:21:17,460 --> 00:21:19,300
That's him on the far end.

610
00:21:19,301 --> 00:21:20,300
I'm frustrated.

611
00:21:20,301 --> 00:21:21,340
We need to watch her on live.

612
00:21:21,341 --> 00:21:22,513
What do we need to do?

613
00:21:22,970 --> 00:21:24,112
What?

614
00:21:24,610 --> 00:21:25,752
My goodness.

615
00:21:26,071 --> 00:21:27,898
Hello, J-Black.

616
00:21:27,940 --> 00:21:29,209
Hello.

617
00:21:29,210 --> 00:21:30,251
(It's J-Black and Mmary, their old choreographers.)

618
00:21:31,481 --> 00:21:35,919
(They're miracle workers who helped the members learn how to dance.)

619
00:21:35,920 --> 00:21:36,980
(They're a well-known choreographing couple.)

620
00:21:36,981 --> 00:21:38,619
- Hello. - Hello.

621
00:21:38,620 --> 00:21:39,903
How are you, my teachers?

622
00:21:39,950 --> 00:21:40,990
- J-Black. - Hello.

623
00:21:40,991 --> 00:21:42,689
- Hello. - It's J-Black.

624
00:21:42,690 --> 00:21:44,530
- They were our mentors. - Hello.

625
00:21:44,531 --> 00:21:46,990
They've visited us once again.

626
00:21:46,991 --> 00:21:48,600
(Why are they back?)

627
00:21:48,601 --> 00:21:51,699
We're here to find So Min,

628
00:21:51,700 --> 00:21:52,899
but why are you here?

629
00:21:52,900 --> 00:21:55,469
You need us in order to catch her.

630
00:21:55,470 --> 00:21:56,500
- What? - Why?

631
00:21:56,501 --> 00:21:58,969
(They need the couple's help.)

632
00:21:58,970 --> 00:22:00,240
- What? - Why?

633
00:22:00,241 --> 00:22:03,439
First, we have a mission for you guys.

634
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:04,592
What is it?

635
00:22:05,081 --> 00:22:06,928
Do we need to dance again?

636
00:22:07,481 --> 00:22:09,020
Do you know the song "IDOL" by BTS?

637
00:22:09,021 --> 00:22:10,020
- Yes. - Yes.

638
00:22:10,021 --> 00:22:11,790
You need to learn...

639
00:22:11,791 --> 00:22:14,050
the dance moves for a part of the song.

640
00:22:14,051 --> 00:22:17,219
(Their mission is to master the dance for "IDOL".)

641
00:22:17,220 --> 00:22:18,472
Goodness.

642
00:22:18,930 --> 00:22:22,060
(The choreography for this song is very detailed and structured.)

643
00:22:22,061 --> 00:22:24,726
(They can only trace So Min once they pass this mission.)

644
00:22:25,001 --> 00:22:28,399
- Goodness. - We need to catch her quickly.

645
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:30,000
- We have no time. - The choreography is difficult.

646
00:22:30,001 --> 00:22:32,409
We need to do this if we want to catch her, right?

647
00:22:32,410 --> 00:22:35,572
If you succeed in this mission,

648
00:22:35,710 --> 00:22:37,810
we will tell you where she is.

649
00:22:37,811 --> 00:22:38,810
We should hurry.

650
00:22:38,811 --> 00:22:40,209
If we succeed before she does,

651
00:22:40,210 --> 00:22:42,020
- we can get her. - We need to hurry.

652
00:22:42,021 --> 00:22:43,636
We should hurry.

653
00:22:43,821 --> 00:22:46,050
We each have a role.

654
00:22:46,051 --> 00:22:48,484
You can pick.

655
00:22:49,220 --> 00:22:50,790
This is only for idols.

656
00:22:50,791 --> 00:22:52,074
You chose V?

657
00:22:53,160 --> 00:22:56,392
- You chose V? - Then who will do him?

658
00:22:56,531 --> 00:22:58,622
Who? Take off your glasses then.

659
00:22:59,331 --> 00:23:01,100
(He can't say anything.)

660
00:23:01,101 --> 00:23:02,100
Are you confident enough?

661
00:23:02,101 --> 00:23:03,686
He's ignoring you.

662
00:23:04,001 --> 00:23:05,109
He knows how he looks without the glasses.

663
00:23:05,110 --> 00:23:07,980
- You shouldn't be Suga. - Suga.

664
00:23:07,981 --> 00:23:09,109
(He's the Suga of Running Man.)

665
00:23:09,110 --> 00:23:10,879
- Suga. - No, you're fired.

666
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:12,480
- Yes, you are. - Yes.

667
00:23:12,481 --> 00:23:13,909
- You're fired. - I am?

668
00:23:13,910 --> 00:23:14,919
Yes.

669
00:23:14,920 --> 00:23:17,080
(Kwang Soo picks Jungkook.)

670
00:23:17,081 --> 00:23:18,219
You're "Jangkook".

671
00:23:18,220 --> 00:23:19,432
Yes, you're "Jangkook".

672
00:23:20,551 --> 00:23:22,020
(He befits a nice warm soup.)

673
00:23:22,021 --> 00:23:23,979
"Jangkook"?

674
00:23:23,991 --> 00:23:25,090
Yes, you are.

675
00:23:25,091 --> 00:23:26,090
Come on.

676
00:23:26,091 --> 00:23:27,790
- What? - That's what you are.

677
00:23:27,791 --> 00:23:29,851
(Kwang Soo has found his role.)

678
00:23:30,130 --> 00:23:32,020
You can be "Jeans".

679
00:23:32,301 --> 00:23:34,330
- He'll be Jeans. - Yes.

680
00:23:34,331 --> 00:23:35,583
Jeans.

681
00:23:36,271 --> 00:23:37,899
Please show us.

682
00:23:37,900 --> 00:23:40,139
Yes, we will show you once.

683
00:23:40,140 --> 00:23:41,609
- We'll show you. - We should watch closely.

684
00:23:41,610 --> 00:23:43,109
- We need to. - Yes.

685
00:23:43,110 --> 00:23:44,109
I bet this won't be easy.

686
00:23:44,110 --> 00:23:45,949
BTS' choreography isn't easy.

687
00:23:45,950 --> 00:23:48,102
They're a globally-renowned group.

688
00:23:48,321 --> 00:23:52,889
(They'll be dancing to the highlight of the song. How hard will it be?)

689
00:23:52,890 --> 00:23:55,119
(It starts off easy.)

690
00:23:55,120 --> 00:23:56,990
- Look at that. - They look nice.

691
00:23:56,991 --> 00:23:58,646
(As if they're riding bikes.)

692
00:23:59,130 --> 00:24:01,353
(The choreography looks very realistic.)

693
00:24:02,031 --> 00:24:04,222
(After turning on the engine, they hop.)

694
00:24:05,071 --> 00:24:07,051
(Kwang Soo also turns on his engine.)

695
00:24:07,870 --> 00:24:09,153
(I can do this much.)

696
00:24:10,071 --> 00:24:11,300
(Now comes the hard part.)

697
00:24:11,301 --> 00:24:12,451
How can we do that?

698
00:24:12,970 --> 00:24:14,587
(He moves skillfully.)

699
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:16,040
- How can we do that? - That's impossible.

700
00:24:16,041 --> 00:24:17,909
- We can't do it. - My gosh.

701
00:24:17,910 --> 00:24:19,510
- My gosh. - How can we do it?

702
00:24:19,511 --> 00:24:21,742
We can't do this.

703
00:24:22,551 --> 00:24:23,719
It's as hard as twirling a sangmo, a traditional dance move.

704
00:24:23,720 --> 00:24:25,337
(Floundering)

705
00:24:25,890 --> 00:24:28,547
(The arm movements make it even harder.)

706
00:24:29,261 --> 00:24:30,790
- We can't do that. - How can we do this?

707
00:24:30,791 --> 00:24:32,074
We can't.

708
00:24:32,531 --> 00:24:33,530
(I can.)

709
00:24:33,531 --> 00:24:35,129
How can we do this?

710
00:24:35,130 --> 00:24:36,645
(He might dislocate all his joints.)

711
00:24:37,601 --> 00:24:39,030
The dance moves look pretty.

712
00:24:39,031 --> 00:24:40,546
How can we pull that off?

713
00:24:40,900 --> 00:24:42,113
We can't.

714
00:24:43,271 --> 00:24:45,594
(They move all their limbs.)

715
00:24:45,940 --> 00:24:48,435
(It's an exciting choreography that contains traditional dance moves.)

716
00:24:48,940 --> 00:24:49,939
(This is what they need to do.)

717
00:24:49,940 --> 00:24:51,769
- Hold on. - That's all you need to do.

718
00:24:51,781 --> 00:24:52,879
This is it.

719
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:54,250
How can we do this?

720
00:24:54,251 --> 00:24:55,250
- How? - Is that it?

721
00:24:55,251 --> 00:24:56,350
- Yes. - That's impossible.

722
00:24:56,351 --> 00:24:58,239
This is easier than the one we did last time.

723
00:24:58,521 --> 00:25:00,219
Don't lie like that.

724
00:25:00,220 --> 00:25:02,139
Do we need to know our positions as well?

725
00:25:02,220 --> 00:25:05,997
At this rate, we will never be able to catch So Min.

726
00:25:06,360 --> 00:25:08,500
We really won't be able to.

727
00:25:08,501 --> 00:25:11,300
Let's do it. We're running out of time.

728
00:25:11,301 --> 00:25:12,699
- Right. - Let's do it.

729
00:25:12,700 --> 00:25:14,840
Let's stop whining and just get to it.

730
00:25:14,841 --> 00:25:16,139
- Right. - Where do we start?

731
00:25:16,140 --> 00:25:17,399
Please tell us.

732
00:25:17,400 --> 00:25:18,420
(They need to succeed before So Min does.)

733
00:25:19,241 --> 00:25:23,826
(How far has So Min learned?)

734
00:25:25,210 --> 00:25:28,382
Since there are 2 men and 1 woman,

735
00:25:28,680 --> 00:25:30,670
- you will stand next to her. - Okay.

736
00:25:30,781 --> 00:25:32,619
And for the men, Yi Kyung...

737
00:25:32,620 --> 00:25:34,320
- Yes? - Step forward.

738
00:25:34,321 --> 00:25:37,048
When you grab each other's hands, do it slowly.

739
00:25:37,491 --> 00:25:40,590
When you pull her in, do it slowly.

740
00:25:40,591 --> 00:25:41,730
All right.

741
00:25:41,731 --> 00:25:42,899
Now...

742
00:25:42,900 --> 00:25:45,830
- You're doing well. - We're a perfect match.

743
00:25:45,831 --> 00:25:47,230
(They get along from the start.)

744
00:25:47,231 --> 00:25:48,584
We're a perfect match.

745
00:25:49,670 --> 00:25:51,709
(You're a perfect match?)

746
00:25:51,710 --> 00:25:53,287
(I'll show you.)

747
00:25:53,610 --> 00:25:56,135
For this part, you will hug the woman who has returned.

748
00:25:56,341 --> 00:25:59,209
- Slow, slow, slow, hug. - Slow, slow, slow, hug.

749
00:25:59,210 --> 00:26:01,879
I'm not very flexible.

750
00:26:01,880 --> 00:26:03,149
You don't have to be flexible.

751
00:26:03,150 --> 00:26:04,968
- Get ready. - Now,

752
00:26:05,021 --> 00:26:06,061
- Set, go. - do I lean back?

753
00:26:06,091 --> 00:26:08,260
Slow, slow...

754
00:26:08,261 --> 00:26:09,332
(She leans back.)

755
00:26:10,261 --> 00:26:12,149
(She collapses.)

756
00:26:12,731 --> 00:26:13,859
(She gets dragged.)

757
00:26:13,860 --> 00:26:15,275
- Hold on. - It's my fault.

758
00:26:15,430 --> 00:26:17,420
I have weak arms.

759
00:26:17,561 --> 00:26:18,570
I'm weak.

760
00:26:18,571 --> 00:26:19,570
- I am. - No.

761
00:26:19,571 --> 00:26:21,129
- I'm heavy. - No, I'm weak.

762
00:26:21,130 --> 00:26:22,600
- You couldn't hold me well. - I'm very weak.

763
00:26:22,601 --> 00:26:25,310
- Now, we'll switch partners. - Okay.

764
00:26:25,311 --> 00:26:26,939
- From the slow, slow part? - Will you be okay?

765
00:26:26,940 --> 00:26:28,728
- Of course. - Ready, set, go.

766
00:26:29,110 --> 00:26:30,191
Go.

767
00:26:30,741 --> 00:26:31,780
Slow.

768
00:26:31,781 --> 00:26:33,310
(So Min, I don't want to go home just yet.)

769
00:26:33,311 --> 00:26:36,080
(That depends on how well you do.)

770
00:26:36,081 --> 00:26:37,719
Slow, slow.

771
00:26:37,720 --> 00:26:40,219
- Lean back. - Slow, slow,

772
00:26:40,220 --> 00:26:41,735
slow, slow.

773
00:26:41,920 --> 00:26:44,159
- Okay. - Slow, slow.

774
00:26:44,160 --> 00:26:46,530
(They succeed.)

775
00:26:46,531 --> 00:26:47,730
That was good.

776
00:26:47,731 --> 00:26:48,730
(Pick me.)

777
00:26:48,731 --> 00:26:49,741
(We're a good match.)

778
00:26:49,860 --> 00:26:51,869
That was good.

779
00:26:51,870 --> 00:26:53,600
Why does she look more comfortable with him?

780
00:26:53,601 --> 00:26:55,199
You're right.

781
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:57,199
- You look more comfortable. - He holds onto me well.

782
00:26:57,200 --> 00:27:00,209
The male needs to be upright.

783
00:27:00,210 --> 00:27:02,010
I'm an upright person, you know.

784
00:27:02,011 --> 00:27:03,409
- I shouldn't follow her? - No.

785
00:27:03,410 --> 00:27:05,850
If you try to help her, that will only make it difficult.

786
00:27:05,851 --> 00:27:07,409
- So... - That's the type of person I am.

787
00:27:07,410 --> 00:27:08,520
He's the giving type.

788
00:27:08,521 --> 00:27:10,219
And he's the selfish type.

789
00:27:10,220 --> 00:27:11,261
That's not true.

790
00:27:12,051 --> 00:27:13,520
(Ji Suk is considerate.)

791
00:27:13,521 --> 00:27:15,959
(Yi Kyung is far from that.)

792
00:27:15,960 --> 00:27:17,132
You're accurate.

793
00:27:17,360 --> 00:27:19,090
- I'm always upright. - Like this...

794
00:27:19,091 --> 00:27:20,330
(Which one will she pick?)

795
00:27:20,331 --> 00:27:21,429
- Okay. - We have a long way to go.

796
00:27:21,430 --> 00:27:23,118
I see.

797
00:27:23,261 --> 00:27:26,399
(Ji Suk, your shoelaces came undone.)

798
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:29,198
You'll trip. Tie it like this.

799
00:27:30,370 --> 00:27:35,835
(The once rivals are now taking care of each other.)

800
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:40,679
Wait, I'm curious. What if they decide to become a couple?

801
00:27:40,680 --> 00:27:43,044
(What if they decide to become a couple?)

802
00:27:43,781 --> 00:27:45,841
No, it's just that his shoelaces kept coming undone.

803
00:27:46,920 --> 00:27:48,490
What will happen to me?

804
00:27:48,491 --> 00:27:50,641
(You two won't leave me behind while you escape, right?)

805
00:27:51,460 --> 00:27:53,790
We'll go right into a dance move.

806
00:27:53,791 --> 00:27:55,060
- Right away? - Here it goes.

807
00:27:55,061 --> 00:27:58,199
Position yourself as if you're riding a bike.

808
00:27:58,200 --> 00:28:00,969
Lean your head towards the direction you're going.

809
00:28:00,970 --> 00:28:03,469
We'll start from the left. Lean left...

810
00:28:03,470 --> 00:28:05,109
- like this. - I know this.

811
00:28:05,110 --> 00:28:07,510
Then you lean towards your right.

812
00:28:07,511 --> 00:28:10,844
Then you turn on the engine and get up.

813
00:28:11,311 --> 00:28:12,966
- I see. - This is easy.

814
00:28:13,511 --> 00:28:14,521
It is.

815
00:28:15,120 --> 00:28:17,645
- It's quite easy. - I know.

816
00:28:18,251 --> 00:28:19,766
It's simple, right?

817
00:28:19,791 --> 00:28:22,244
(Yes, it is.)

818
00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:25,330
(She's terrified.)

819
00:28:25,331 --> 00:28:27,830
- I feel bad for BTS. - I know.

820
00:28:27,831 --> 00:28:30,199
This is where it gets a little bit tricky.

821
00:28:30,200 --> 00:28:31,514
(The complicated parts start now.)

822
00:28:32,130 --> 00:28:36,715
(This is the part that they were all worried about.)

823
00:28:37,670 --> 00:28:38,770
The timing for jumping...

824
00:28:38,771 --> 00:28:40,609
- is quite tricky. - I see.

825
00:28:40,610 --> 00:28:44,015
- 5, 6, 7, 8. And you jump at 8. - Okay.

826
00:28:44,311 --> 00:28:46,310
- I'll start off slowly. - Your right foot comes first.

827
00:28:46,311 --> 00:28:49,109
(They need to be alert in order to catch So Min.)

828
00:28:49,720 --> 00:28:51,020
(You jump at 8.)

829
00:28:51,021 --> 00:28:53,617
(And then, you shake your legs.)

830
00:28:54,351 --> 00:28:56,459
(The members are following well.)

831
00:28:56,460 --> 00:28:57,733
Like this.

832
00:28:57,791 --> 00:28:59,579
So that's the beat.

833
00:28:59,630 --> 00:29:01,448
You need to end with your left foot forward.

834
00:29:01,860 --> 00:29:03,678
(Kwang Soo makes strange movements.)

835
00:29:03,831 --> 00:29:05,800
- Are you mimicking a zombie? - I know.

836
00:29:05,801 --> 00:29:07,699
- Right? - He looks like it.

837
00:29:07,700 --> 00:29:09,199
Isn't that the Choi Hong Man dance?

838
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:10,600
It looks creepy.

839
00:29:10,601 --> 00:29:12,040
(They're infected with a virus.)

840
00:29:12,041 --> 00:29:13,081
It's so creepy.

841
00:29:14,470 --> 00:29:16,510
All right, now we will continue.

842
00:29:16,511 --> 00:29:19,909
When you kick, push your other foot backwards.

843
00:29:19,910 --> 00:29:21,949
- And kick. - And kick.

844
00:29:21,950 --> 00:29:23,119
And kick.

845
00:29:23,120 --> 00:29:25,848
- From here, you switch feet. - Kick.

846
00:29:26,091 --> 00:29:27,350
- Kick. - Kick.

847
00:29:27,351 --> 00:29:28,889
(Kwang Soo dances frivolously.)

848
00:29:28,890 --> 00:29:30,090
Isn't this the Tetris dance?

849
00:29:30,091 --> 00:29:31,706
- Kick. - Isn't it?

850
00:29:32,031 --> 00:29:33,629
Kick from there.

851
00:29:33,630 --> 00:29:35,448
(He dances to the beat.)

852
00:29:35,831 --> 00:29:38,600
(This is a magic show where idol's dance moves become...)

853
00:29:38,601 --> 00:29:39,611
(a Tetris dance.)

854
00:29:40,231 --> 00:29:42,139
(Kwang Soo attracts a crowd.)

855
00:29:42,140 --> 00:29:44,139
- You're good. - He is.

856
00:29:44,140 --> 00:29:45,180
Right.

857
00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:47,209
(The Tetris performance meets a successful end.)

858
00:29:47,210 --> 00:29:48,209
Tetris.

859
00:29:48,210 --> 00:29:50,402
- Jangkook, that was good. - Right?

860
00:29:50,610 --> 00:29:52,903
- Wasn't I good? - Wait a minute. My pants are...

861
00:29:53,150 --> 00:29:56,419
(What's wrong with his pants?)

862
00:29:56,420 --> 00:29:57,850
Oh, come on!

863
00:29:57,851 --> 00:29:59,889
- What is that? That's disgusting. - Hey!

864
00:29:59,890 --> 00:30:01,520
(Mmary is shocked as well.)

865
00:30:01,521 --> 00:30:02,732
What's wrong with him?

866
00:30:03,460 --> 00:30:04,590
(My jeans were making me uncomfortable.)

867
00:30:04,591 --> 00:30:06,030
Look at him.

868
00:30:06,031 --> 00:30:08,060
(He wears a pair of tights.)

869
00:30:08,061 --> 00:30:09,344
What's wrong with you?

870
00:30:09,900 --> 00:30:11,800
(Why did you take off your pants?)

871
00:30:11,801 --> 00:30:14,070
- Why did you take them off? - What's wrong with you?

872
00:30:14,071 --> 00:30:15,939
(They force him out.)

873
00:30:15,940 --> 00:30:17,718
What has gotten into him?

874
00:30:18,140 --> 00:30:19,510
- Gosh. - These are sportswear.

875
00:30:19,511 --> 00:30:20,810
What do you mean?

876
00:30:20,811 --> 00:30:22,439
- They are. - Why is he like that?

877
00:30:22,440 --> 00:30:24,197
Look at her face.

878
00:30:24,610 --> 00:30:26,298
He must be exhausted.

879
00:30:26,511 --> 00:30:28,879
- Those were sportswear. - Just wear those pants.

880
00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:29,879
- Hi again. - That was awful.

881
00:30:29,880 --> 00:30:31,149
They were sportswear.

882
00:30:31,150 --> 00:30:33,719
I hated looking at that.

883
00:30:33,720 --> 00:30:35,520
- Okay, I'll continue. - All right.

884
00:30:35,521 --> 00:30:37,889
- Are you disgusted with us? - No.

885
00:30:37,890 --> 00:30:39,429
(It feels like he is.)

886
00:30:39,430 --> 00:30:40,429
All right.

887
00:30:40,430 --> 00:30:41,490
I'm sorry.

888
00:30:41,491 --> 00:30:43,359
We'll learn the next moves.

889
00:30:43,360 --> 00:30:45,699
- It's so hard. - This is the important part.

890
00:30:45,700 --> 00:30:48,699
From the outside to the inside.

891
00:30:48,700 --> 00:30:50,899
- I see. - From the outside to the inside.

892
00:30:50,900 --> 00:30:52,469
- It's hard. - Put it in.

893
00:30:52,470 --> 00:30:53,969
Put it in. Use your arms.

894
00:30:53,970 --> 00:30:55,324
(She's impressed by Haha.)

895
00:30:56,081 --> 00:30:58,209
(He squirms around, and that doesn't look bad.)

896
00:30:58,210 --> 00:30:59,350
That's it.

897
00:30:59,351 --> 00:31:01,080
Can you do that a bit faster?

898
00:31:01,081 --> 00:31:02,480
- This is right? - One, two.

899
00:31:02,481 --> 00:31:03,879
(Did I miss something? This is right?)

900
00:31:03,880 --> 00:31:05,219
One... To the inside. No, I mean...

901
00:31:05,220 --> 00:31:06,362
- Is this right? - Not like that.

902
00:31:06,450 --> 00:31:07,501
This...

903
00:31:08,251 --> 00:31:10,219
- I meant the feel of it... - You look so cool!

904
00:31:10,220 --> 00:31:12,060
- You look like an idol. - You have the feel,

905
00:31:12,061 --> 00:31:13,129
but it's different.

906
00:31:13,130 --> 00:31:14,777
From here, one...

907
00:31:15,531 --> 00:31:17,479
- Then go down to your left, - How about the hands?

908
00:31:17,761 --> 00:31:18,881
- Cross it. - Go like this.

909
00:31:19,231 --> 00:31:20,342
Cross it.

910
00:31:20,970 --> 00:31:22,639
Now your left shoulder. This is a bit more difficult.

911
00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:23,699
Gosh.

912
00:31:23,700 --> 00:31:24,782
Like this.

913
00:31:25,170 --> 00:31:27,292
1, 2, 3, 4.

914
00:31:27,710 --> 00:31:30,034
(He copied the dance exactly the same way.)

915
00:31:30,481 --> 00:31:31,652
Gosh, I knew it.

916
00:31:31,851 --> 00:31:33,265
It must be nice for you, Jong Kook.

917
00:31:33,450 --> 00:31:34,949
Perfect. That was perfect.

918
00:31:34,950 --> 00:31:36,597
(Jong Kook picked it up perfectly, starting to lead the whole team!)

919
00:31:36,981 --> 00:31:38,219
You each have to memorize it.

920
00:31:38,220 --> 00:31:40,919
(Thanks to Jong Kook's guidance of the dance and movements,)

921
00:31:40,920 --> 00:31:44,192
(the Bangtan Adults slowly start to dance correctly!)

922
00:31:44,591 --> 00:31:47,060
(They will have to succeed before So Min does to catch her.)

923
00:31:47,061 --> 00:31:50,061
(Will they be able to chase past her this time?)

924
00:31:51,501 --> 00:31:53,270
(Meanwhile, Team Love Triangle Tango...)

925
00:31:53,271 --> 00:31:56,270
(will clap the slate, first.)

926
00:31:56,271 --> 00:31:57,411
How are you going to do it?

927
00:31:57,440 --> 00:31:59,709
- Spin around. - 1, 2, 3.

928
00:31:59,710 --> 00:32:02,139
(I'm going to do it in a beautiful and cute way.)

929
00:32:02,140 --> 00:32:06,250
(I am the slate fairy around here.)

930
00:32:06,251 --> 00:32:09,449
It's so nice and harmonious without the other boys.

931
00:32:09,450 --> 00:32:11,780
(It's so nice and harmonious without the other boys.)

932
00:32:11,781 --> 00:32:13,189
They're always mean to me,

933
00:32:13,190 --> 00:32:15,685
but they both keep saying that I'm pretty.

934
00:32:15,920 --> 00:32:17,389
It feels so nice.

935
00:32:17,390 --> 00:32:18,603
It doesn't feel like I'm on the usual show,

936
00:32:19,061 --> 00:32:21,359
but like we're doing a whole new show just for you.

937
00:32:21,360 --> 00:32:23,451
Yes, it feels like a different show.

938
00:32:23,660 --> 00:32:26,427
- Let's go on to the next step. - Okay.

939
00:32:26,601 --> 00:32:28,015
Spin your female partner...

940
00:32:29,001 --> 00:32:30,485
- and ta-da! - Ta-da!

941
00:32:30,640 --> 00:32:32,185
Then, the female partner comes back...

942
00:32:33,110 --> 00:32:34,240
and the male takes her in his arms,

943
00:32:34,241 --> 00:32:35,694
then the male holds her leg up.

944
00:32:38,210 --> 00:32:40,379
(Gosh!)

945
00:32:40,380 --> 00:32:42,350
(That much physical contact...)

946
00:32:42,351 --> 00:32:43,461
Gosh.

947
00:32:43,521 --> 00:32:44,763
That is the end.

948
00:32:45,051 --> 00:32:46,820
(Will they be able to pull off this move?)

949
00:32:46,821 --> 00:32:47,990
Let's do it.

950
00:32:47,991 --> 00:32:49,636
I will have to leave this up to So Min.

951
00:32:50,220 --> 00:32:51,320
Now...

952
00:32:51,321 --> 00:32:52,471
Where do we begin? Here?

953
00:32:52,531 --> 00:32:54,090
- Let's begin. - Is it here?

954
00:32:54,091 --> 00:32:55,629
1, 2...

955
00:32:55,630 --> 00:32:56,872
(For this couple,)

956
00:32:57,231 --> 00:33:01,330
(in the drama, Yi Kyung was a macho who led So Min.)

957
00:33:01,331 --> 00:33:03,219
Spin around and go,

958
00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:04,800
then come back.

959
00:33:04,801 --> 00:33:05,840
(How will they be in real life?)

960
00:33:05,841 --> 00:33:07,053
Leave it up to me!

961
00:33:07,811 --> 00:33:09,840
You have to grab on to here!

962
00:33:09,841 --> 00:33:11,879
(You have to grab on to here!)

963
00:33:11,880 --> 00:33:13,900
(Pinch)

964
00:33:14,051 --> 00:33:15,580
How could I? No, no.

965
00:33:15,581 --> 00:33:16,763
Come on.

966
00:33:16,851 --> 00:33:17,992
You don't have to keep your manners.

967
00:33:18,081 --> 00:33:20,241
- Hold it up, it's just dance! - Okay.

968
00:33:21,321 --> 00:33:22,401
Like this,

969
00:33:22,620 --> 00:33:23,760
then lean back.

970
00:33:23,761 --> 00:33:24,771
(Do it properly. We can't escape if we get it wrong!)

971
00:33:25,160 --> 00:33:26,260
(No!)

972
00:33:26,261 --> 00:33:28,513
(I'm shy.)

973
00:33:28,801 --> 00:33:29,800
(Staring)

974
00:33:29,801 --> 00:33:31,376
- That was intense. - So Min,

975
00:33:31,460 --> 00:33:32,669
why are you practicing with Yi Kyung?

976
00:33:32,670 --> 00:33:34,869
(Jealousy explodes.)

977
00:33:34,870 --> 00:33:35,981
No, it's not like that.

978
00:33:36,440 --> 00:33:38,609
- I'll just practice on my own. - No.

979
00:33:38,610 --> 00:33:39,721
(Ji Suk is being childish.)

980
00:33:41,041 --> 00:33:42,209
I'm disappointed!

981
00:33:42,210 --> 00:33:44,480
No, it's because he's easier to control without feelings.

982
00:33:44,481 --> 00:33:46,572
Don't lie. Dance with me, too.

983
00:33:46,950 --> 00:33:48,149
It's because I'm shy.

984
00:33:48,150 --> 00:33:49,820
- It's much simpler with him... - Whatever.

985
00:33:49,821 --> 00:33:52,050
(Passionate romance is not easy, even with the competition up close.)

986
00:33:52,051 --> 00:33:53,790
I have to go like this, then...

987
00:33:53,791 --> 00:33:55,419
(Practice with Ji Suk begins.)

988
00:33:55,420 --> 00:33:57,815
Don't lean me back, but hold on to me first.

989
00:33:57,860 --> 00:34:00,083
You have to hold me so I can do this.

990
00:34:00,130 --> 00:34:01,260
Is this where I need to bend back?

991
00:34:01,261 --> 00:34:03,684
- Yes, you bend back slowly. - Bend back, then...

992
00:34:06,331 --> 00:34:10,469
(Ji Suk, by the way,)

993
00:34:10,470 --> 00:34:13,409
(this eye contact...)

994
00:34:13,410 --> 00:34:16,009
(doesn't seem too unfamiliar.)

995
00:34:16,010 --> 00:34:19,810
(It's like we've gone back to when we were Kang Soon and Yoo Baek.)

996
00:34:19,811 --> 00:34:21,779
(Should we just...)

997
00:34:21,780 --> 00:34:24,619
(No, So Min!)

998
00:34:24,620 --> 00:34:25,934
- Do this, then... - Kiss.

999
00:34:26,021 --> 00:34:27,319
Do I get back up after this?

1000
00:34:27,320 --> 00:34:28,401
Is it like this?

1001
00:34:28,590 --> 00:34:29,659
Hey!

1002
00:34:29,660 --> 00:34:31,640
(Hey!)

1003
00:34:32,561 --> 00:34:33,589
I'm not sure, yet.

1004
00:34:33,590 --> 00:34:34,742
I'm just practicing.

1005
00:34:34,861 --> 00:34:36,730
- Come and practice over here - I'm just practicing, Yi Kyung.

1006
00:34:36,731 --> 00:34:38,074
(Are they suppose to be completing a mission, or doing a drama shoot?)

1007
00:34:38,101 --> 00:34:41,231
(Will they even be able to complete the mission?)

1008
00:34:41,370 --> 00:34:43,540
Should we see each of you from the beginning?

1009
00:34:43,541 --> 00:34:44,813
- From the top? - Yes.

1010
00:34:44,870 --> 00:34:46,184
Okay. Let's take it slowly.

1011
00:34:46,970 --> 00:34:48,657
I can't remember the sequence.

1012
00:34:48,840 --> 00:34:50,179
So Min, do you remember all the steps?

1013
00:34:50,180 --> 00:34:51,339
(Ji Suk and So Min go first.)

1014
00:34:51,340 --> 00:34:52,391
If I don't know...

1015
00:34:53,010 --> 00:34:54,779
- I'll just go with the flow... - Oh, we're doing it with music?

1016
00:34:54,780 --> 00:34:56,437
- even if something goes wrong. - Okay.

1017
00:34:57,050 --> 00:34:58,319
(How will Yoo Baek couple's tango turn out?)

1018
00:34:58,320 --> 00:34:59,705
Slow.

1019
00:34:59,890 --> 00:35:01,466
Slow.

1020
00:35:03,061 --> 00:35:06,928
(Ji Suk leads So Min smoothly with his words.)

1021
00:35:08,030 --> 00:35:11,330
(Is it a plot twist? Their teamwork doesn't seem too bad.)

1022
00:35:11,331 --> 00:35:14,330
(Looking unstable)

1023
00:35:15,030 --> 00:35:17,040
(They start to look somewhat unstable.)

1024
00:35:17,041 --> 00:35:18,080
What's next?

1025
00:35:18,171 --> 00:35:19,270
Step backwards.

1026
00:35:19,271 --> 00:35:21,331
(Missed a step)

1027
00:35:21,870 --> 00:35:23,901
(I like how it's going.)

1028
00:35:24,010 --> 00:35:25,040
Let's go.

1029
00:35:25,041 --> 00:35:27,710
(It's too early to give up. Let's try again.)

1030
00:35:27,711 --> 00:35:29,250
(The music stops abruptly.)

1031
00:35:29,251 --> 00:35:30,420
- Wait. - Wait.

1032
00:35:30,421 --> 00:35:32,119
(The music stops abruptly.)

1033
00:35:32,120 --> 00:35:33,750
(Wait!)

1034
00:35:33,751 --> 00:35:35,049
- It stopped! - Let's try and finish it.

1035
00:35:35,050 --> 00:35:36,790
- Let's try and finish it. - It stopped.

1036
00:35:36,791 --> 00:35:37,901
(There's a long way left, but they weren't cautious of the time.)

1037
00:35:38,160 --> 00:35:40,529
- No. - I wish there were more music left.

1038
00:35:40,530 --> 00:35:41,630
(Their "Last Tango" ended with too much vibe and no time.)

1039
00:35:41,631 --> 00:35:42,759
(Next up is Yi Kyung, who only looks up to So Min.)

1040
00:35:42,760 --> 00:35:43,810
Let's do this.

1041
00:35:44,030 --> 00:35:47,333
I didn't think putting more feeling into it was this hard.

1042
00:35:47,671 --> 00:35:49,660
Now, your gaze.

1043
00:35:49,700 --> 00:35:50,770
Okay.

1044
00:35:50,771 --> 00:35:52,139
(Concentrate the mind...)

1045
00:35:52,140 --> 00:35:53,210
Okay.

1046
00:35:53,211 --> 00:35:54,270
(and set the gaze.)

1047
00:35:54,271 --> 00:35:55,351
It's all set.

1048
00:35:57,780 --> 00:36:01,650
(Yi Kyung takes the perfect lead with his gaze set.)

1049
00:36:01,651 --> 00:36:04,850
(Snap!)

1050
00:36:04,851 --> 00:36:09,536
(Shy Yi Kyung is gone, now he owns the stage with strong energy.)

1051
00:36:09,660 --> 00:36:13,060
<font color="#fcc89b">[VIU Ver] SBS E447 Running Man</font>

<font color="#ff5fa2">-♥ Ruo Xi ♥-</font>

1052
00:36:13,160 --> 00:36:15,786
(Perfect teamwork)

1053
00:36:16,061 --> 00:36:18,969
(I got you, So Min.)

1054
00:36:18,970 --> 00:36:22,569
Stretch it, one, look back,

1055
00:36:22,570 --> 00:36:23,914
now turn...

1056
00:36:24,200 --> 00:36:25,710
and spin!

1057
00:36:25,711 --> 00:36:28,265
(I lost. I respect you, tango macho.)

1058
00:36:28,441 --> 00:36:30,610
(The Running Man dancing queen...)

1059
00:36:30,611 --> 00:36:34,049
(and the Havana B-boy's "Last Tango".)

1060
00:36:34,050 --> 00:36:38,424
(Will you dance your "Last Tango" with me?)

1061
00:36:39,021 --> 00:36:40,619
(Shaking)

1062
00:36:40,620 --> 00:36:41,690
Don't move.

1063
00:36:41,691 --> 00:36:44,590
(The tough woman is back. Hold on!)

1064
00:36:44,760 --> 00:36:47,159
(What a relief!)

1065
00:36:47,160 --> 00:36:49,524
Yi Kyung is so good at this!

1066
00:36:50,061 --> 00:36:51,676
You're so good.

1067
00:36:51,831 --> 00:36:52,969
Should we try one more time?

1068
00:36:52,970 --> 00:36:54,400
(Yi Kyung's macho tango stole her heart.)

1069
00:36:54,401 --> 00:36:55,713
You're making me jealous!

1070
00:36:55,941 --> 00:36:57,758
Gosh, that was like Haha. I should stop.

1071
00:36:58,441 --> 00:37:01,139
So Min, you will now have to choose one partner...

1072
00:37:01,140 --> 00:37:03,009
to continue on with the next date.

1073
00:37:03,010 --> 00:37:04,697
Oh, no.

1074
00:37:05,450 --> 00:37:07,400
It's too cruel.

1075
00:37:08,180 --> 00:37:10,119
Before we end, I was really happy to be with you.

1076
00:37:10,120 --> 00:37:11,750
- Me too. - Although it's a competition.

1077
00:37:11,751 --> 00:37:13,568
It seems like I'm the bad one.

1078
00:37:13,590 --> 00:37:16,389
(Who will So Min choose, between the two?)

1079
00:37:16,390 --> 00:37:20,489
(Despite full of mistakes and being bad at dancing,)

1080
00:37:20,490 --> 00:37:23,429
(the one who shared a heart throbbing gaze, Ji Suk?)

1081
00:37:23,430 --> 00:37:27,299
(Or...)

1082
00:37:27,300 --> 00:37:29,670
(the shy boy...)

1083
00:37:29,671 --> 00:37:33,310
(who turns into a macho when dancing!)

1084
00:37:33,311 --> 00:37:35,739
(The surprise heartthrob, Yi Kyung?)

1085
00:37:35,740 --> 00:37:37,125
I will choose, now.

1086
00:37:37,140 --> 00:37:39,880
(Who will be the man...)

1087
00:37:39,881 --> 00:37:41,150
(to have stolen the birthday girl's heart?)

1088
00:37:41,151 --> 00:37:43,200
1, 2, 3!

1089
00:37:43,351 --> 00:37:48,250
(The next date will be with Ji Suk.)

1090
00:37:48,251 --> 00:37:50,039
(The cry of happiness)

1091
00:37:50,220 --> 00:37:51,389
I think I'll be standing like this until tomorrow.

1092
00:37:51,390 --> 00:37:52,929
(On the other hand, the tango macho...)

1093
00:37:52,930 --> 00:37:57,042
(is cuddled by the tango teacher's arms.)

1094
00:37:57,260 --> 00:37:58,543
It's so thick.

1095
00:37:59,030 --> 00:38:00,170
It's so thick!

1096
00:38:00,171 --> 00:38:03,302
(The teacher's pet and the teacher make a new couple.)

1097
00:38:04,041 --> 00:38:05,199
Thank you.

1098
00:38:05,200 --> 00:38:07,998
- No, Yi Kyung. - It's okay. I'm really happy.

1099
00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:10,700
Sometimes it's good to just be a passerby.

1100
00:38:11,041 --> 00:38:13,302
- I'm really sorry. - Don't say that.

1101
00:38:13,550 --> 00:38:15,641
- Thank you so much. - Don't mention it.

1102
00:38:15,950 --> 00:38:17,119
I'll get going, then.

1103
00:38:17,120 --> 00:38:18,231
You have to leave while dancing the tango.

1104
00:38:18,251 --> 00:38:19,766
Yes. While dancing the tango, nicely.

1105
00:38:19,820 --> 00:38:21,790
Tango, my foot!

1106
00:38:21,791 --> 00:38:24,244
(Tango, my foot!)

1107
00:38:24,291 --> 00:38:25,420
I'm leaving.

1108
00:38:25,421 --> 00:38:26,929
(Yi Kyung leaves with his heart broken by tango.)

1109
00:38:26,930 --> 00:38:28,089
Goodbye.

1110
00:38:28,090 --> 00:38:29,374
(Yi Kyung leaves with his heart broken by tango.)

1111
00:38:31,300 --> 00:38:33,000
When you get the hang of it,

1112
00:38:33,001 --> 00:38:34,429
- you can begin. - Okay. We will.

1113
00:38:34,430 --> 00:38:35,956
- Let's do this, BT. - Okay.

1114
00:38:36,340 --> 00:38:37,799
- Okay. - More like Shabby.

1115
00:38:37,800 --> 00:38:40,568
(So to speak...)

1116
00:38:40,970 --> 00:38:44,374
(If BTS is the flashy idol on stage,)

1117
00:38:44,481 --> 00:38:45,909
- Running Machine. - Running Machine!

1118
00:38:45,910 --> 00:38:47,021
(we are the Shabby BTS.)

1119
00:38:47,211 --> 00:38:48,322
Shudder.

1120
00:38:48,510 --> 00:38:49,592
Ji-Hyope.

1121
00:38:50,220 --> 00:38:51,291
Buffet.

1122
00:38:51,820 --> 00:38:53,265
- Kim Jimin. - Fired.

1123
00:38:53,291 --> 00:38:54,290
Jangkook.

1124
00:38:54,291 --> 00:38:56,744
(Finishing off with Jangkook.)

1125
00:38:57,561 --> 00:38:58,589
Let's do this!

1126
00:38:58,590 --> 00:39:00,480
(Let's get it, Bangtan Adults!)

1127
00:39:01,430 --> 00:39:05,542
(Start the "IDOL" dance!)

1128
00:39:06,771 --> 00:39:08,650
(I'm the hip hop gangster around here.)

1129
00:39:11,700 --> 00:39:15,509
(They have unexpectedly amazing teamwork.)

1130
00:39:15,510 --> 00:39:18,873
(And they nailed the major dance move.)

1131
00:39:20,251 --> 00:39:23,281
(They show perfect unity when dancing the difficult moves!)

1132
00:39:24,620 --> 00:39:27,217
(The zombie's arms and legs move separately.)

1133
00:39:27,521 --> 00:39:29,237
(Let's go, Hip Zombie!)

1134
00:39:29,490 --> 00:39:31,489
1, 2, 3, 4.

1135
00:39:31,490 --> 00:39:34,560
(With Running Machine's chant, they force immediate unity.)

1136
00:39:35,291 --> 00:39:39,230
(The small show-off tries to act cool.)

1137
00:39:39,231 --> 00:39:41,291
- Let's go! - One, two, three, and let's go!

1138
00:39:41,700 --> 00:39:44,100
(Will they complete the dance...)

1139
00:39:44,101 --> 00:39:46,636
(in their first try?)

1140
00:39:48,771 --> 00:39:49,880
Oh, It's this side!

1141
00:39:49,881 --> 00:39:51,021
Come on!

1142
00:39:51,780 --> 00:39:53,679
(They failed because Seok Jin used his other hand.)

1143
00:39:53,680 --> 00:39:55,639
- It's discouraging. - Turn the music off!

1144
00:39:56,351 --> 00:39:57,650
You're discouraging us.

1145
00:39:57,651 --> 00:39:58,819
(They attack with criticism.)

1146
00:39:58,820 --> 00:40:00,489
It's this. Why would you do this?

1147
00:40:00,490 --> 00:40:01,489
I thought it was this hand.

1148
00:40:01,490 --> 00:40:02,560
I'm sorry. I'm...

1149
00:40:02,561 --> 00:40:04,076
- left-handed. - Come on!

1150
00:40:04,890 --> 00:40:05,972
Okay, I get it now.

1151
00:40:06,191 --> 00:40:08,553
You have to act cool.

1152
00:40:08,631 --> 00:40:10,116
You're going to try again, right?

1153
00:40:10,131 --> 00:40:11,799
- Yes. - Let's do it.

1154
00:40:11,800 --> 00:40:12,810
Music, please!

1155
00:40:13,631 --> 00:40:14,711
Our last try.

1156
00:40:16,171 --> 00:40:17,500
(I'm the center.)

1157
00:40:17,501 --> 00:40:18,683
(Push)

1158
00:40:19,941 --> 00:40:22,380
(The variety gangsters fight vigorously for the spot...)

1159
00:40:22,381 --> 00:40:24,633
(in order to get the solo angle.)

1160
00:40:24,780 --> 00:40:26,397
Look, they look so cool.

1161
00:40:26,950 --> 00:40:28,123
This is the coolest part.

1162
00:40:30,180 --> 00:40:33,654
(They work towards the middle of the song without a hitch.)

1163
00:40:34,791 --> 00:40:37,119
(This is the part where Ji Suk failed.)

1164
00:40:37,120 --> 00:40:40,090
(He now succeeds easily.)

1165
00:40:40,861 --> 00:40:44,062
(It's now the last part!)

1166
00:40:44,200 --> 00:40:45,869
- "Tang, tang, tang-tang-tang"! - "Tang, tang, tang-tang-tang"!

1167
00:40:45,870 --> 00:40:48,170
(Ji Suk finishes it off early.)

1168
00:40:48,171 --> 00:40:49,352
Oh, come on.

1169
00:40:49,401 --> 00:40:50,481
Please!

1170
00:40:50,800 --> 00:40:51,839
What?

1171
00:40:51,840 --> 00:40:53,225
Why are you the only one different?

1172
00:40:53,311 --> 00:40:54,350
I just...

1173
00:40:54,510 --> 00:40:56,400
- It's "tang, tang, tang-tang-tang". - Okay.

1174
00:40:56,410 --> 00:40:57,880
(This is how you do it.)

1175
00:40:57,881 --> 00:40:58,940
(He's off-tune and off-beat.)

1176
00:40:58,941 --> 00:40:59,980
No, that's not it.

1177
00:40:59,981 --> 00:41:03,279
(Try to dance to this beat.)

1178
00:41:03,280 --> 00:41:04,549
Seok Jin, try this.

1179
00:41:04,550 --> 00:41:06,989
Tang, tang, maeuntang.

1180
00:41:06,990 --> 00:41:08,089
("Tang, tang, maeuntang".)

1181
00:41:08,090 --> 00:41:10,659
(You like maeuntang.)

1182
00:41:10,660 --> 00:41:12,929
Tang, tang, maeuntang.

1183
00:41:12,930 --> 00:41:14,244
- That's easier. - It's easier, right?

1184
00:41:14,490 --> 00:41:16,960
Tang, tang, maeuntang.

1185
00:41:16,961 --> 00:41:18,000
There we go.

1186
00:41:18,001 --> 00:41:19,770
- That actually worked? - Of course, it did.

1187
00:41:19,771 --> 00:41:21,029
(That actually worked?)

1188
00:41:21,030 --> 00:41:22,699
- What is that? - It's custom training.

1189
00:41:22,700 --> 00:41:24,287
- It's custom training. - Sure.

1190
00:41:24,401 --> 00:41:26,210
For bad dancers like him,

1191
00:41:26,211 --> 00:41:28,110
there's a certain way to teach them.

1192
00:41:28,111 --> 00:41:29,279
I can't believe that worked.

1193
00:41:29,280 --> 00:41:31,639
- "Tang, tang, maeuntang". - "Tang, tang, maeuntang".

1194
00:41:31,640 --> 00:41:32,650
Let's keep going.

1195
00:41:32,651 --> 00:41:33,850
- Let's go! - There's no time.

1196
00:41:33,851 --> 00:41:35,920
- It's our last chance! - Our last chance. Cue the music.

1197
00:41:35,921 --> 00:41:38,647
(They need to hurry up to catch So Min!)

1198
00:41:39,851 --> 00:41:42,889
(Bangtan Adults take the stage.)

1199
00:41:42,890 --> 00:41:44,334
(I want to be at the center.)

1200
00:41:45,120 --> 00:41:47,389
(He looks determined.)

1201
00:41:47,390 --> 00:41:50,159
(Here comes the group dance!)

1202
00:41:50,160 --> 00:41:53,262
(We're the Bangtan Adults.)

1203
00:41:54,030 --> 00:41:55,670
1, 2, 3, 4.

1204
00:41:55,671 --> 00:41:58,670
(With the ace's cadence,)

1205
00:42:00,570 --> 00:42:03,510
- 1, 2, 3, 4. - 1, 2, 3, 4.

1206
00:42:03,740 --> 00:42:06,610
(Bangtan Adults are going at it.)

1207
00:42:06,611 --> 00:42:09,250
(They'll get a hint of So Min's location if they succeed here.)

1208
00:42:09,251 --> 00:42:11,099
- 1, 2, 3, 4. - Let's go!

1209
00:42:11,351 --> 00:42:13,520
(Here comes the highlight.)

1210
00:42:13,521 --> 00:42:16,723
(He's dancing passionately.)

1211
00:42:18,120 --> 00:42:19,889
(This is where Seok Jin makes mistakes.)

1212
00:42:19,890 --> 00:42:22,455
(Now he's done it perfectly!)

1213
00:42:24,160 --> 00:42:25,159
Nice, nice.

1214
00:42:25,160 --> 00:42:26,170
(You got this, Seok Jin!)

1215
00:42:26,171 --> 00:42:28,630
(There's only the problematic part left.)

1216
00:42:28,631 --> 00:42:31,429
(Will they be able to succeed with "maeuntang" training?)

1217
00:42:31,700 --> 00:42:34,869
("Tang, tang, maeuntang".)

1218
00:42:34,870 --> 00:42:36,610
"Tang, tang, maeuntang"!

1219
00:42:36,611 --> 00:42:39,040
(And a synchronized finish!)

1220
00:42:39,041 --> 00:42:42,009
(Dancing "IDOL" by BTS is a success.)

1221
00:42:42,010 --> 00:42:43,779
- We did it! - The "maeuntang" worked.

1222
00:42:43,780 --> 00:42:44,819
(The "maeuntang" worked.)

1223
00:42:44,820 --> 00:42:46,002
Good job!

1224
00:42:46,050 --> 00:42:47,364
We made it, right?

1225
00:42:47,590 --> 00:42:49,020
I'll give you guys a pass.

1226
00:42:49,021 --> 00:42:50,719
(He announces their success.)

1227
00:42:50,720 --> 00:42:52,589
(Now they're given a hint that tells So Min's location.)

1228
00:42:52,590 --> 00:42:54,889
- We did it! - "Tang, tang, maeuntang" did it.

1229
00:42:54,890 --> 00:42:56,929
- Right, "Tang, tang, maeuntang". - "Maeuntang" saved us.

1230
00:42:56,930 --> 00:42:58,900
Now we need to find So Min.

1231
00:42:58,901 --> 00:42:59,900
(It's time for them to go after So Min.)

1232
00:42:59,901 --> 00:43:01,400
Since you've succeeded...

1233
00:43:01,401 --> 00:43:02,684
Thank you, sir.

1234
00:43:03,041 --> 00:43:04,400
- Let's go, everyone. - Thank you!

1235
00:43:04,401 --> 00:43:05,652
- Bye, now. - Yes!

1236
00:43:05,870 --> 00:43:06,909
Thank you.

1237
00:43:06,910 --> 00:43:08,009
- Let's go. - Let's go.

1238
00:43:08,010 --> 00:43:09,757
- Let's go get her! - Hurry it up.

1239
00:43:10,311 --> 00:43:12,402
We need to find So Min.

1240
00:43:13,510 --> 00:43:16,580
We just can't afford to get the penalty for this.

1241
00:43:16,581 --> 00:43:17,779
(At this moment)

1242
00:43:17,780 --> 00:43:19,049
Why is Yi Kyung calling me?

1243
00:43:19,050 --> 00:43:20,449
(Suddenly, Yi Kyung called him.)

1244
00:43:20,450 --> 00:43:21,589
- He did? - What does he want?

1245
00:43:21,590 --> 00:43:22,920
- What does he want? - Answer the phone.

1246
00:43:22,921 --> 00:43:24,020
Hey, Yi Kyung.

1247
00:43:24,021 --> 00:43:25,576
- Jong Kook. - Yes.

1248
00:43:25,720 --> 00:43:28,357
- I was stood up. - Where are you?

1249
00:43:28,490 --> 00:43:31,330
I was stood up by So Min. I'm at the tango place alone!

1250
00:43:31,331 --> 00:43:32,460
(Anger explodes.)

1251
00:43:32,461 --> 00:43:33,969
- I was stood up. - He was stood up?

1252
00:43:33,970 --> 00:43:35,299
You were stood up?

1253
00:43:35,300 --> 00:43:36,739
I thought he just got here.

1254
00:43:36,740 --> 00:43:38,100
(Why did Yi Kyung call the members?)

1255
00:43:38,101 --> 00:43:40,639
You have not been selected by So Min.

1256
00:43:40,640 --> 00:43:42,710
You are now the incarnation of revenge.

1257
00:43:42,711 --> 00:43:44,210
You may join the Running Man members,

1258
00:43:44,211 --> 00:43:46,610
and eliminate So Min's name tag to win the game.

1259
00:43:46,611 --> 00:43:47,650
Okay.

1260
00:43:47,651 --> 00:43:49,049
(Join the members and eliminate So Min's name tag!)

1261
00:43:49,050 --> 00:43:50,060
Jeon So Min.

1262
00:43:50,780 --> 00:43:52,350
How dare you ditch me?

1263
00:43:52,351 --> 00:43:53,650
(I'll get my revenge on you.)

1264
00:43:53,651 --> 00:43:56,246
She abandoned me and hurt my feelings.

1265
00:43:56,691 --> 00:43:58,960
But you're such a sweet guy!

1266
00:43:58,961 --> 00:44:01,587
We're on the way there.

1267
00:44:01,831 --> 00:44:04,759
No, she already left without me!

1268
00:44:04,760 --> 00:44:05,830
Already?

1269
00:44:05,831 --> 00:44:08,932
(So Min had left the tango place?)

1270
00:44:09,541 --> 00:44:11,299
(So Min and Ji Suk did their last tango...)

1271
00:44:11,300 --> 00:44:13,040
(to win the mission.)

1272
00:44:13,041 --> 00:44:14,869
(Ji Suk was very bad at practice,)

1273
00:44:14,870 --> 00:44:16,679
(and now he's leading her!)

1274
00:44:16,680 --> 00:44:17,710
It was a success.

1275
00:44:17,711 --> 00:44:19,250
- Thank you. - Thank you!

1276
00:44:19,251 --> 00:44:20,250
(And the tango date will be charged to...)

1277
00:44:20,251 --> 00:44:21,350
- Thank you. - Thank you.

1278
00:44:21,351 --> 00:44:22,920
I choose Kwang Soo.

1279
00:44:22,921 --> 00:44:23,980
You got it.

1280
00:44:23,981 --> 00:44:25,819
(So Min decided to charge Kwang Soo for the lesson.)

1281
00:44:25,820 --> 00:44:27,062
Thanks, Kwang Soo!

1282
00:44:27,791 --> 00:44:28,801
Thanks!

1283
00:44:28,950 --> 00:44:30,319
Shall we move on?

1284
00:44:30,320 --> 00:44:31,619
- Let's go! - Okay.

1285
00:44:31,620 --> 00:44:32,989
(And they move on to the next destination.)

1286
00:44:32,990 --> 00:44:34,273
You did well.

1287
00:44:34,631 --> 00:44:38,560
(So Min chose me.)

1288
00:44:38,561 --> 00:44:39,869
(It's fine as long as she didn't choose me.)

1289
00:44:39,870 --> 00:44:42,270
So should we go where you are?

1290
00:44:42,271 --> 00:44:43,469
Or somewhere else?

1291
00:44:43,470 --> 00:44:45,995
- Don't come here. - Okay.

1292
00:44:46,311 --> 00:44:49,810
Go to Munbal-dong, 554 and 3.

1293
00:44:49,811 --> 00:44:53,150
- 554, there you go. - and 3.

1294
00:44:53,151 --> 00:44:54,695
- Okay. - We got it.

1295
00:44:54,981 --> 00:44:57,319
- Go get them, guys! - Okay.

1296
00:44:57,320 --> 00:45:00,250
(Go get them, guys!)

1297
00:45:00,251 --> 00:45:02,049
I'll break them apart!

1298
00:45:02,050 --> 00:45:04,242
All right, I'll see you soon.

1299
00:45:04,620 --> 00:45:06,730
- I'll see you soon. - Okay, bye.

1300
00:45:06,731 --> 00:45:08,478
- We'll meet him later. - Yes.

1301
00:45:08,660 --> 00:45:10,600
So she's still with Ji Suk.

1302
00:45:10,601 --> 00:45:11,799
- Yes. - They ate a meal.

1303
00:45:11,800 --> 00:45:13,286
Does she have feelings for him?

1304
00:45:14,231 --> 00:45:15,600
I think there's another guy who is expecting us.

1305
00:45:15,601 --> 00:45:16,869
Who is it now?

1306
00:45:16,870 --> 00:45:18,040
(So Min and Ji Suk are moving on to the next place.)

1307
00:45:18,041 --> 00:45:19,100
But...

1308
00:45:19,101 --> 00:45:20,369
(They're headed to a rural area.)

1309
00:45:20,370 --> 00:45:21,839
Where are we going?

1310
00:45:21,840 --> 00:45:23,053
(They can't see a thing.)

1311
00:45:24,041 --> 00:45:25,223
What is it?

1312
00:45:25,441 --> 00:45:26,895
(Where is their next destination?)

1313
00:45:26,910 --> 00:45:27,992
What is it? Where is it?

1314
00:45:28,233 --> 00:45:29,292
But...

1315
00:45:29,293 --> 00:45:30,561
(They're headed to a rural area.)

1316
00:45:30,562 --> 00:45:32,031
Where are we going?

1317
00:45:32,032 --> 00:45:33,245
(They can't see a thing.)

1318
00:45:34,233 --> 00:45:35,415
What is it?

1319
00:45:35,633 --> 00:45:36,715
What is it?

1320
00:45:37,102 --> 00:45:38,184
Where is it? Where are we now?

1321
00:45:38,259 --> 00:45:39,767
- We're going kart racing. - Kart racing?

1322
00:45:39,768 --> 00:45:40,827
(They're going kart racing!)

1323
00:45:40,828 --> 00:45:43,324
(What will they be doing?)

1324
00:45:43,669 --> 00:45:45,728
(The refreshing feeling of getting cool winds on your face.)

1325
00:45:46,009 --> 00:45:49,037
(Kart racing is a perfect date to cool off the tango heat!)

1326
00:45:49,038 --> 00:45:51,664
Can you give me 30 seconds?

1327
00:45:52,879 --> 00:45:55,648
(She's wearing makeup.)

1328
00:45:55,649 --> 00:45:58,577
(You don't know who's going to be there.)

1329
00:45:58,578 --> 00:46:00,887
Why are you putting on makeup?

1330
00:46:00,888 --> 00:46:02,505
You've changed again.

1331
00:46:03,018 --> 00:46:04,918
(That's not it.)

1332
00:46:04,919 --> 00:46:06,069
Let's go.

1333
00:46:07,489 --> 00:46:09,923
You're really enjoying this, aren't you?

1334
00:46:10,399 --> 00:46:11,557
So Min.

1335
00:46:11,558 --> 00:46:14,398
(So Min, we've been doing great until now.)

1336
00:46:14,399 --> 00:46:17,227
(You're not leaving me, are you?)

1337
00:46:17,598 --> 00:46:20,108
(Ji Suk...)

1338
00:46:20,109 --> 00:46:22,378
(We'll see what happens.)

1339
00:46:22,379 --> 00:46:23,707
Seriously?

1340
00:46:23,708 --> 00:46:26,638
(She's firm.)

1341
00:46:27,179 --> 00:46:31,219
(What will happen to them in the next date?)

1342
00:46:34,219 --> 00:46:36,036
So there's another guy in there?

1343
00:46:37,058 --> 00:46:39,187
(Another date...)

1344
00:46:39,188 --> 00:46:41,785
(waiting for So Min?)

1345
00:46:42,498 --> 00:46:44,258
(You can tell...)

1346
00:46:44,259 --> 00:46:48,268
(that he's a sweet guy.)

1347
00:46:50,868 --> 00:46:52,253
(Oh my goodness)

1348
00:46:53,368 --> 00:46:54,508
Hey!

1349
00:46:54,509 --> 00:46:55,548
(He puts a smile on So Min's face.)

1350
00:46:56,078 --> 00:46:57,738
(On the other hand,)

1351
00:46:57,739 --> 00:46:58,937
Hey!

1352
00:46:58,938 --> 00:47:00,407
(Ji Suk had been dreading for this moment.)

1353
00:47:00,408 --> 00:47:01,778
This is unbelievable.

1354
00:47:01,779 --> 00:47:03,030
Hey!

1355
00:47:03,348 --> 00:47:05,247
Oh, my gosh.

1356
00:47:05,248 --> 00:47:07,914
(It's the smart and sexy actor, Ha Seok Jin.)

1357
00:47:08,888 --> 00:47:11,588
(They looked very good together...)

1358
00:47:11,589 --> 00:47:15,769
(in the TV series and in reality.)

1359
00:47:16,958 --> 00:47:18,428
(She's glad to see him,)

1360
00:47:18,429 --> 00:47:20,045
(and runs to him.)

1361
00:47:21,529 --> 00:47:22,548
Hey!

1362
00:47:22,938 --> 00:47:24,281
It's been a while.

1363
00:47:24,399 --> 00:47:25,767
Seok Jin!

1364
00:47:25,768 --> 00:47:27,108
(She's very glad to see him.)

1365
00:47:27,109 --> 00:47:28,108
Seok Jin.

1366
00:47:28,109 --> 00:47:30,907
- What's wrong? - You've got to be kidding me.

1367
00:47:31,038 --> 00:47:33,577
- It was Ha Seok Jin. - Thank you, both of you.

1368
00:47:33,578 --> 00:47:34,648
I love this.

1369
00:47:34,649 --> 00:47:35,977
I got two handsome men on both sides.

1370
00:47:35,978 --> 00:47:37,718
(They did not see this coming.)

1371
00:47:37,719 --> 00:47:39,163
I need to check my face.

1372
00:47:40,649 --> 00:47:41,900
You look fine.

1373
00:47:42,118 --> 00:47:44,758
That mirror looks good on you.

1374
00:47:44,759 --> 00:47:46,748
(That mirror looks good on you.)

1375
00:47:48,259 --> 00:47:50,218
My lips are dry.

1376
00:47:52,498 --> 00:47:53,528
(What's he doing?)

1377
00:47:53,529 --> 00:47:56,068
I've noticed that So Min doesn't look as happy...

1378
00:47:56,069 --> 00:47:57,568
as when she saw Yi Kyung.

1379
00:47:57,569 --> 00:47:59,862
(She doesn't look as happy as when she saw Yi Kyung.)

1380
00:48:00,169 --> 00:48:01,738
No, I like this very much!

1381
00:48:01,739 --> 00:48:03,799
(Seok Jin's trying to look calm.)

1382
00:48:04,078 --> 00:48:05,695
- Fine. - That's not true.

1383
00:48:05,978 --> 00:48:08,378
- What's not true? - I like you.

1384
00:48:08,379 --> 00:48:11,105
(I like you.)

1385
00:48:13,419 --> 00:48:15,206
I think I already won!

1386
00:48:15,919 --> 00:48:18,140
(Why do I feel like I've lost already?)

1387
00:48:18,319 --> 00:48:20,511
You two look great, by the way.

1388
00:48:21,158 --> 00:48:22,528
- Especially you. - What do you mean?

1389
00:48:22,529 --> 00:48:25,097
You lost a lot of weight.

1390
00:48:25,098 --> 00:48:26,568
My weight hasn't changed.

1391
00:48:26,569 --> 00:48:28,327
- No way. - You're being weird.

1392
00:48:28,328 --> 00:48:29,898
No, you absolutely look better.

1393
00:48:29,899 --> 00:48:31,767
- It looks awkward. - She does that to everyone.

1394
00:48:31,768 --> 00:48:33,991
- She's being weirdly welcoming. - Right, she is.

1395
00:48:34,138 --> 00:48:35,608
I felt it oo.

1396
00:48:35,609 --> 00:48:36,992
(You got me.)

1397
00:48:37,408 --> 00:48:39,847
We talked about you earlier.

1398
00:48:39,848 --> 00:48:41,508
How many kissing scenes have you done with So Min?

1399
00:48:41,509 --> 00:48:43,398
(Abruptly)

1400
00:48:45,888 --> 00:48:48,242
(Why now?)

1401
00:48:48,888 --> 00:48:50,287
We often did it even though it wasn't on the script.

1402
00:48:50,288 --> 00:48:51,517
We were too!

1403
00:48:51,518 --> 00:48:53,727
We kissed like 40 times.

1404
00:48:53,728 --> 00:48:55,428
I thought I was the one who kissed her the most,

1405
00:48:55,429 --> 00:48:56,657
- More than me? - and I wasn't.

1406
00:48:56,658 --> 00:48:58,298
Seok Jin and I kissed once per episode,

1407
00:48:58,299 --> 00:49:00,267
Ji Suk and I kissed more times.

1408
00:49:00,268 --> 00:49:01,468
(This is about the pride now.)

1409
00:49:01,469 --> 00:49:02,867
How was he? Was he any good?

1410
00:49:02,868 --> 00:49:04,009
(How was he? Was he any good?)

1411
00:49:05,938 --> 00:49:07,322
I wouldn't know.

1412
00:49:07,438 --> 00:49:09,338
It's just different, Seok Jin's more of a manly kisser,

1413
00:49:09,339 --> 00:49:11,008
and you're more of a sweet kisser.

1414
00:49:11,009 --> 00:49:12,493
(They have different kissing styles.)

1415
00:49:13,208 --> 00:49:14,290
It's like...

1416
00:49:14,449 --> 00:49:16,148
- we're two ex-boyfriends. - That's what I was thinking!

1417
00:49:16,149 --> 00:49:17,918
(It's like we're two ex-boyfriends.)

1418
00:49:17,919 --> 00:49:19,948
That's how I feel! It's weird.

1419
00:49:19,949 --> 00:49:21,718
We need to be chosen by her.

1420
00:49:21,719 --> 00:49:22,758
(The battle of the ex-boyfriends begins now.)

1421
00:49:22,759 --> 00:49:25,212
How? On what grounds?

1422
00:49:25,359 --> 00:49:27,611
We've prepared a mission.

1423
00:49:27,859 --> 00:49:29,898
It's called Love Love Kart.

1424
00:49:29,899 --> 00:49:30,928
Love Love Kart?

1425
00:49:30,929 --> 00:49:34,798
So Min will choose the one...

1426
00:49:34,799 --> 00:49:36,959
between these two men.

1427
00:49:37,098 --> 00:49:38,838
And she will get on a kart with the chosen one.

1428
00:49:38,839 --> 00:49:41,668
And she'll race with the other who isn't chosen.

1429
00:49:41,669 --> 00:49:43,477
(The chosen one rides with her, the other one rides alone.)

1430
00:49:43,478 --> 00:49:45,008
But, same as last time,

1431
00:49:45,009 --> 00:49:46,548
the one who isn't chosen by So Min...

1432
00:49:46,549 --> 00:49:48,048
and loses the race will be eliminated.

1433
00:49:48,049 --> 00:49:49,218
And his date is over.

1434
00:49:49,219 --> 00:49:51,077
But last time,

1435
00:49:51,078 --> 00:49:53,088
she chose one after the dancing competition.

1436
00:49:53,089 --> 00:49:55,675
And she's just choosing a guy now?

1437
00:49:55,958 --> 00:49:58,218
To ride in the same kart,

1438
00:49:58,219 --> 00:50:00,088
- you need good teamwork. - Right.

1439
00:50:00,089 --> 00:50:03,128
We have another game to figure out...

1440
00:50:03,129 --> 00:50:05,249
what types of guys you are.

1441
00:50:05,728 --> 00:50:08,267
It's Pit-a-pat Jenga.

1442
00:50:08,268 --> 00:50:10,968
The two of you will take turns,

1443
00:50:10,969 --> 00:50:13,363
and ask her questions.

1444
00:50:13,569 --> 00:50:15,977
If So Min doesn't choose you as the answer to the question,

1445
00:50:15,978 --> 00:50:18,537
you take one block out and put it on the top.

1446
00:50:18,538 --> 00:50:21,477
We need to ask questions where she can choose between us.

1447
00:50:21,478 --> 00:50:23,017
I see.

1448
00:50:23,018 --> 00:50:24,178
(They need to ask questions so she can choose one of them.)

1449
00:50:24,179 --> 00:50:25,948
It's been so long since I last played Jenga.

1450
00:50:25,949 --> 00:50:27,969
- It's Pit-a-pat Jenga. - It's all set now.

1451
00:50:27,989 --> 00:50:30,311
(Which ex-boyfriend will win this game?)

1452
00:50:30,759 --> 00:50:32,657
I need to ask her questions...

1453
00:50:32,658 --> 00:50:34,447
and make her choose me.

1454
00:50:34,629 --> 00:50:35,657
Go ahead.

1455
00:50:35,658 --> 00:50:36,709
Between the two of us,

1456
00:50:37,929 --> 00:50:39,615
who would you call...

1457
00:50:39,799 --> 00:50:41,468
when you're drunk?

1458
00:50:41,469 --> 00:50:44,267
(Who would you call when you're drunk?)

1459
00:50:44,268 --> 00:50:45,298
(She's thinking.)

1460
00:50:45,299 --> 00:50:46,537
- Seriously? - Yes.

1461
00:50:46,538 --> 00:50:48,367
Who would I call when I'm drunk?

1462
00:50:48,368 --> 00:50:50,327
- I'm calling? - Yes.

1463
00:50:50,978 --> 00:50:52,493
(Smiles)

1464
00:50:53,808 --> 00:50:56,077
(Her smiles...)

1465
00:50:56,078 --> 00:50:57,948
(make them happy.)

1466
00:50:57,949 --> 00:51:00,218
The smile makes me feel sad already.

1467
00:51:00,219 --> 00:51:01,359
Should I just say it?

1468
00:51:02,388 --> 00:51:04,218
1, 2, 3.

1469
00:51:04,219 --> 00:51:07,258
(The one she would call when she's drunk.)

1470
00:51:07,989 --> 00:51:11,358
(Which one she will choose?)

1471
00:51:11,359 --> 00:51:12,398
Ha Seok Jin!

1472
00:51:12,399 --> 00:51:14,692
(She chooses Seok Jin.)

1473
00:51:14,929 --> 00:51:16,898
Wait, let's hear why.

1474
00:51:16,899 --> 00:51:18,097
If I remember correctly,

1475
00:51:18,098 --> 00:51:21,867
Seok Jin was the only one I drank with...

1476
00:51:21,868 --> 00:51:23,338
to the point I got drunk.

1477
00:51:23,339 --> 00:51:25,477
You drank more with him than when you drank with me?

1478
00:51:25,478 --> 00:51:27,398
(He's in a rage.)

1479
00:51:27,649 --> 00:51:28,678
That's how I remember.

1480
00:51:28,679 --> 00:51:30,778
- At a team dinner, - Are you for real?

1481
00:51:30,779 --> 00:51:33,847
I don't remember drinking that much with Ji Suk.

1482
00:51:33,848 --> 00:51:35,648
I was hammered when I drank with you.

1483
00:51:35,649 --> 00:51:36,657
Really?

1484
00:51:36,658 --> 00:51:37,957
Is this a competition?

1485
00:51:37,958 --> 00:51:40,557
I thought she was going to choose me.

1486
00:51:40,558 --> 00:51:41,988
I'm sorry.

1487
00:51:41,989 --> 00:51:44,858
Why don't you go ahead and take one block out?

1488
00:51:44,859 --> 00:51:46,298
Go ahead.

1489
00:51:46,299 --> 00:51:47,338
With a light one.

1490
00:51:47,768 --> 00:51:49,657
That's easy.

1491
00:51:49,839 --> 00:51:50,968
(Someone loses as the Jenga falls.)

1492
00:51:50,969 --> 00:51:51,997
This is bad.

1493
00:51:51,998 --> 00:51:53,767
- You touch it, you can't change. - Which one is it?

1494
00:51:53,768 --> 00:51:55,168
- You can't change the block. - Is that it?

1495
00:51:55,169 --> 00:51:56,378
(He goes for the lower block.)

1496
00:51:56,379 --> 00:51:57,838
I think it's going to fall.

1497
00:51:57,839 --> 00:51:59,077
I don't think so.

1498
00:51:59,078 --> 00:52:00,577
Please keep your hands off the table.

1499
00:52:00,578 --> 00:52:02,265
Sure.

1500
00:52:02,348 --> 00:52:03,477
Keep your hands off.

1501
00:52:03,478 --> 00:52:06,720
(He tries to focus again.)

1502
00:52:08,288 --> 00:52:10,157
(Shaking)

1503
00:52:10,158 --> 00:52:11,588
- I'm getting nervous. - I like seeing...

1504
00:52:11,589 --> 00:52:12,988
- friends competing... - Wait, wait, wait.

1505
00:52:12,989 --> 00:52:14,878
- Keep your foot off. - over me.

1506
00:52:15,688 --> 00:52:17,758
(It looks risky.)

1507
00:52:17,759 --> 00:52:20,626
(To disturb Ji Suk)

1508
00:52:21,768 --> 00:52:23,111
Please don't.

1509
00:52:24,438 --> 00:52:26,489
(I just want to win.)

1510
00:52:26,839 --> 00:52:28,108
They always try to solve quizzes...

1511
00:52:28,109 --> 00:52:29,937
- Stop talking. - Okay.

1512
00:52:29,938 --> 00:52:31,637
I'm just talking to myself.

1513
00:52:31,638 --> 00:52:32,962
Why am I getting so nervous?

1514
00:52:34,049 --> 00:52:35,907
He also hurt his finger.

1515
00:52:35,908 --> 00:52:37,077
- I heard. - Yes.

1516
00:52:37,078 --> 00:52:39,614
Can you believe he broke his finger while taking a shower?

1517
00:52:40,089 --> 00:52:41,331
Can you?

1518
00:52:41,489 --> 00:52:43,175
- Look at it. - That could happen.

1519
00:52:43,288 --> 00:52:45,339
- It's your turn. - Is it my turn?

1520
00:52:45,788 --> 00:52:47,457
I'll just be direct.

1521
00:52:47,458 --> 00:52:50,185
Which one do you want to take more care of?

1522
00:52:50,498 --> 00:52:51,841
Oh, no.

1523
00:52:52,399 --> 00:52:54,751
Why are you doing this to me?

1524
00:52:54,868 --> 00:52:57,120
(She's going to choose me.)

1525
00:52:57,598 --> 00:53:00,008
(Who will So Min choose?)

1526
00:53:00,009 --> 00:53:01,207
Ha Seok Jin!

1527
00:53:01,208 --> 00:53:03,027
(She chooses Seok Jin again.)

1528
00:53:05,679 --> 00:53:08,378
(It's Seok Jin again?)

1529
00:53:08,379 --> 00:53:09,948
That's not it.

1530
00:53:09,949 --> 00:53:11,847
- I have a reason. - You don't have to be nice...

1531
00:53:11,848 --> 00:53:13,387
- to him because he's new. - I have a reason.

1532
00:53:13,388 --> 00:53:14,747
- Just listen to me. - I feel great.

1533
00:53:14,748 --> 00:53:16,488
- Hear me out. - It better be reasonable.

1534
00:53:16,489 --> 00:53:20,326
You take good care of yourself on your own.

1535
00:53:21,029 --> 00:53:22,588
Then what about him?

1536
00:53:22,589 --> 00:53:24,928
I can't take care of myself. I need someone to put my socks on.

1537
00:53:24,929 --> 00:53:27,497
(I need someone to put my socks on.)

1538
00:53:27,498 --> 00:53:30,267
- Are you serious? - From what I've seen,

1539
00:53:30,268 --> 00:53:32,807
even on the set, I tried to take care of him.

1540
00:53:32,808 --> 00:53:35,939
He makes me want to take care of him.

1541
00:53:36,339 --> 00:53:37,338
I'm hurt for real.

1542
00:53:37,339 --> 00:53:39,008
- I've been hit on the head. - He's attractive.

1543
00:53:39,009 --> 00:53:41,635
Don't be mad at me.

1544
00:53:41,908 --> 00:53:44,848
(The battle between ex-boyfriends is firing up.)

1545
00:53:45,549 --> 00:53:47,438
Where are we now?

1546
00:53:47,788 --> 00:53:48,787
What is this place?

1547
00:53:48,788 --> 00:53:50,988
There's a sign. It's a roller-skating rink!

1548
00:53:50,989 --> 00:53:51,988
What?

1549
00:53:51,989 --> 00:53:54,311
- Roller skates? - Yes, a roller-skating rink.

1550
00:53:54,388 --> 00:53:55,488
I really loved this place.

1551
00:53:55,489 --> 00:53:56,497
Only if there weren't kids like Jong Kook.

1552
00:53:56,498 --> 00:53:58,298
I went to this place a lot.

1553
00:53:58,299 --> 00:54:00,218
It's my first time coming here.

1554
00:54:00,498 --> 00:54:02,128
It's nostalgic.

1555
00:54:02,129 --> 00:54:03,437
They usually play music.

1556
00:54:03,438 --> 00:54:04,448
- You're right. - Right.

1557
00:54:05,138 --> 00:54:07,129
(They're excited to be here.)

1558
00:54:08,169 --> 00:54:09,577
That was playing all the time.

1559
00:54:09,578 --> 00:54:11,378
But didn't Yi Kyung told us to come here?

1560
00:54:11,379 --> 00:54:13,378
- There's Yi Kyung! - Yi Kyung!

1561
00:54:13,379 --> 00:54:14,561
- Yi Kyung! - Hello.

1562
00:54:14,748 --> 00:54:17,000
She didn't choose me!

1563
00:54:17,719 --> 00:54:18,918
(Screaming)

1564
00:54:18,919 --> 00:54:20,187
You look ugly today.

1565
00:54:20,188 --> 00:54:21,488
(He's pitiful today.)

1566
00:54:21,489 --> 00:54:24,417
She made me tango, and do all the other stuff.

1567
00:54:25,188 --> 00:54:27,309
- I feel bad for you. - You just got ditched.

1568
00:54:27,688 --> 00:54:29,203
So where is So Min?

1569
00:54:29,288 --> 00:54:31,698
The moment she eliminated me,

1570
00:54:31,699 --> 00:54:33,597
they took off in a car.

1571
00:54:33,598 --> 00:54:35,028
We need to catch her.

1572
00:54:35,029 --> 00:54:36,097
- So Min. - Where is she?

1573
00:54:36,098 --> 00:54:37,568
- We need to catch her. - What do we do?

1574
00:54:37,569 --> 00:54:38,867
Do you want to catch So Min?

1575
00:54:38,868 --> 00:54:40,668
- Yes! - Of course we do!

1576
00:54:40,669 --> 00:54:43,707
- We need to catch her and stop... - Of course!

1577
00:54:43,708 --> 00:54:45,901
- increasing their debts. - Right.

1578
00:54:46,279 --> 00:54:48,577
We installed a tracking device on So Min...

1579
00:54:48,578 --> 00:54:50,077
without her knowledge.

1580
00:54:50,078 --> 00:54:51,577
- Yes! - You could've told us that earlier.

1581
00:54:51,578 --> 00:54:54,887
This is your last chance to earn the tracking device.

1582
00:54:54,888 --> 00:54:56,988
All of you will be wearing the roller skates.

1583
00:54:56,989 --> 00:54:59,584
And move the flour in relays...

1584
00:54:59,589 --> 00:55:02,187
to fill half the cup.

1585
00:55:02,188 --> 00:55:03,758
- Okay. - I got it.

1586
00:55:03,759 --> 00:55:05,698
Let's go get her, everyone!

1587
00:55:05,699 --> 00:55:07,298
- Shall we go? - Let's go!

1588
00:55:07,299 --> 00:55:08,568
Let's go get So Min!

1589
00:55:08,569 --> 00:55:10,558
Let's go, it's a hunt!

1590
00:55:10,739 --> 00:55:12,198
(I will never forgive you, So Min!)

1591
00:55:12,199 --> 00:55:14,207
Let's go, take as much as you can.

1592
00:55:14,208 --> 00:55:15,668
(First attempt, start!)

1593
00:55:15,669 --> 00:55:17,295
We can't take a break.

1594
00:55:17,609 --> 00:55:19,093
There's no stopping.

1595
00:55:19,138 --> 00:55:20,347
No rest!

1596
00:55:20,348 --> 00:55:21,778
Be careful not to drop it.

1597
00:55:21,779 --> 00:55:23,567
( Jong Kook carefully delivers it to Jae Seok.)

1598
00:55:24,179 --> 00:55:25,278
(They're being careful.)

1599
00:55:25,279 --> 00:55:27,712
- That's quite a lot. - Good.

1600
00:55:27,819 --> 00:55:29,202
No fooling around this time.

1601
00:55:29,388 --> 00:55:31,387
One more time. Jong Kook, keep going!

1602
00:55:31,388 --> 00:55:33,913
(The point is to keep delivering it.)

1603
00:55:34,929 --> 00:55:36,997
(It is delivered to the next runner, Seok Jin.)

1604
00:55:36,998 --> 00:55:38,614
(Dripping)

1605
00:55:39,498 --> 00:55:40,597
(Seok Jin blows all the flour.)

1606
00:55:40,598 --> 00:55:43,437
- Seok Jin... - Why did you blow!

1607
00:55:43,438 --> 00:55:45,863
His face makes me laugh.

1608
00:55:46,239 --> 00:55:48,288
Seok Jin's the problem here.

1609
00:55:50,109 --> 00:55:51,148
Good, good.

1610
00:55:51,739 --> 00:55:53,278
(Trying not to laugh seems to be much harder.)

1611
00:55:53,279 --> 00:55:54,490
Stop laughing!

1612
00:55:54,578 --> 00:55:56,077
Why are they laughing?

1613
00:55:56,078 --> 00:55:57,477
Why!

1614
00:55:57,478 --> 00:55:59,378
We only did a little bit.

1615
00:55:59,379 --> 00:56:01,218
(It's delivered to the last runner, Kwang Soo.)

1616
00:56:01,219 --> 00:56:02,703
(That's all they got.)

1617
00:56:03,618 --> 00:56:06,042
(They're all gone because they laughed.)

1618
00:56:07,158 --> 00:56:09,622
(He's putting it in the cup.)

1619
00:56:11,458 --> 00:56:13,114
We can't make it at this speed!

1620
00:56:14,768 --> 00:56:17,162
This isn't going to work.

1621
00:56:18,098 --> 00:56:19,338
(They have less than half the time.)

1622
00:56:19,339 --> 00:56:21,068
Good, you're doing great!

1623
00:56:21,069 --> 00:56:22,568
(Jong Kook and Jae Seok got the hang of it.)

1624
00:56:22,569 --> 00:56:23,892
Okay, okay.

1625
00:56:24,478 --> 00:56:25,650
Don't laugh!

1626
00:56:25,908 --> 00:56:28,008
(They did it without laughing.)

1627
00:56:28,009 --> 00:56:29,493
(However,)

1628
00:56:30,279 --> 00:56:31,864
(Seok Jin slipped.)

1629
00:56:32,118 --> 00:56:34,117
Should we change the order?

1630
00:56:34,118 --> 00:56:35,128
(He drops it in various ways.)

1631
00:56:36,149 --> 00:56:39,764
(Now he bumps into Yi Kyung.)

1632
00:56:40,888 --> 00:56:42,358
(What are you doing?)

1633
00:56:42,359 --> 00:56:43,541
Let's switch!

1634
00:56:44,929 --> 00:56:46,227
It's going into my nose.

1635
00:56:46,228 --> 00:56:47,468
(Seok Jin keeps making excused.)

1636
00:56:47,469 --> 00:56:48,479
Hey.

1637
00:56:49,328 --> 00:56:52,802
(They still try their best.)

1638
00:56:53,969 --> 00:56:55,108
Kwang Soo!

1639
00:56:55,109 --> 00:56:56,278
(Where's Kwang Soo?)

1640
00:56:56,279 --> 00:56:57,490
What are you doing?

1641
00:56:57,609 --> 00:56:59,397
(Ta-da)

1642
00:56:59,908 --> 00:57:01,747
(He looks very comfortable like a giraffe.)

1643
00:57:01,748 --> 00:57:02,758
No!

1644
00:57:04,879 --> 00:57:05,977
What are you doing!

1645
00:57:05,978 --> 00:57:08,372
(Even a giraffe sometimes slips.)

1646
00:57:08,788 --> 00:57:09,988
(We're done for.)

1647
00:57:09,989 --> 00:57:11,231
This is it, guys.

1648
00:57:11,589 --> 00:57:13,088
Let's go again.

1649
00:57:13,089 --> 00:57:15,310
(He tries to shake all the flour.)

1650
00:57:18,699 --> 00:57:19,867
- Come on. - Why can't you...

1651
00:57:19,868 --> 00:57:21,867
- do it right? - Seok Jin keeps spilling.

1652
00:57:21,868 --> 00:57:23,919
- You spill too much. - My bad.

1653
00:57:24,699 --> 00:57:26,267
Kwang Soo should go first.

1654
00:57:26,268 --> 00:57:27,468
- It's difficult. - Because...

1655
00:57:27,469 --> 00:57:28,738
he's having a hard time receiving it.

1656
00:57:28,739 --> 00:57:29,878
- You go first. - And this...

1657
00:57:29,879 --> 00:57:31,008
- the table's too low. - You go first!

1658
00:57:31,009 --> 00:57:32,292
I'll be the last one.

1659
00:57:32,339 --> 00:57:33,707
Haha and I will be at the end.

1660
00:57:33,708 --> 00:57:35,597
All right, let's see how it goes.

1661
00:57:35,978 --> 00:57:37,878
- We'll see. - Are you guys ready?

1662
00:57:37,879 --> 00:57:38,977
- Yes! - Let's go!

1663
00:57:38,978 --> 00:57:40,565
Let's go!

1664
00:57:40,788 --> 00:57:41,887
Ready...

1665
00:57:41,888 --> 00:57:44,010
(Second attempt, start!)

1666
00:57:44,759 --> 00:57:45,887
(He scooped a lot.)

1667
00:57:45,888 --> 00:57:47,746
That's a lot.

1668
00:57:49,388 --> 00:57:50,398
(Then he grabs Jae Seok by the collar,)

1669
00:57:50,399 --> 00:57:52,657
(and falls.)

1670
00:57:52,658 --> 00:57:54,144
- No! - I'm sorry.

1671
00:57:54,399 --> 00:57:55,867
- Come on! - Let's go again.

1672
00:57:55,868 --> 00:57:58,364
- I'll go again. - Who put those two together?

1673
00:57:58,969 --> 00:58:00,887
Do not put them together!

1674
00:58:01,138 --> 00:58:03,260
I'm going right away!

1675
00:58:03,478 --> 00:58:05,108
Forget it.

1676
00:58:05,109 --> 00:58:06,190
(He falls again.)

1677
00:58:06,449 --> 00:58:07,893
Come on!

1678
00:58:08,179 --> 00:58:09,378
Forget it.

1679
00:58:09,379 --> 00:58:10,762
(What's your problem now?)

1680
00:58:10,779 --> 00:58:12,448
You need to hold him.

1681
00:58:12,449 --> 00:58:13,787
Yes, hold him.

1682
00:58:13,788 --> 00:58:16,141
Kwang Soo, you need to bend down your neck.

1683
00:58:16,859 --> 00:58:17,887
(Blowing)

1684
00:58:17,888 --> 00:58:19,676
(Blowing)

1685
00:58:20,158 --> 00:58:22,128
(The battle of flour between Kwang Soo and Jae Seok.)

1686
00:58:22,129 --> 00:58:23,976
Don't pour on my nose!

1687
00:58:24,498 --> 00:58:26,175
You blocked my nose!

1688
00:58:26,469 --> 00:58:28,227
- Okay. - How do you want me to breathe?

1689
00:58:28,228 --> 00:58:29,798
That's it, we're done.

1690
00:58:29,799 --> 00:58:32,324
We're finished.

1691
00:58:32,469 --> 00:58:33,953
(Blowing)

1692
00:58:34,538 --> 00:58:36,068
(The second battle of flour.)

1693
00:58:36,069 --> 00:58:37,108
What are you two doing?

1694
00:58:37,109 --> 00:58:39,229
This is a mess.

1695
00:58:39,879 --> 00:58:41,178
Please.

1696
00:58:41,179 --> 00:58:42,477
He started it!

1697
00:58:42,478 --> 00:58:44,196
Let's just give up.

1698
00:58:44,279 --> 00:58:45,577
Let's just ride the roller skates.

1699
00:58:45,578 --> 00:58:46,660
(They gave up chasing So Min.)

1700
00:58:47,419 --> 00:58:48,761
This isn't working.

1701
00:58:50,788 --> 00:58:53,017
- I feel dizzy. - I don't want to lose any of you.

1702
00:58:53,018 --> 00:58:55,009
- I don't want to lose any of you. - No, I'm dizzy.

1703
00:58:55,489 --> 00:58:56,943
- Now... - Ask your question.

1704
00:58:57,199 --> 00:58:58,310
Among the two of us,

1705
00:58:59,598 --> 00:59:02,053
(What's he going to ask her now?)

1706
00:59:02,129 --> 00:59:04,260
who do you think liked you more?

1707
00:59:04,438 --> 00:59:07,943
(Who do you think liked you more?)

1708
00:59:07,969 --> 00:59:09,778
As a man.

1709
00:59:09,779 --> 00:59:11,707
- Right. - As the opposite sex.

1710
00:59:11,708 --> 00:59:14,108
Which of us did you think really liked you?

1711
00:59:14,109 --> 00:59:15,291
(What do I do?)

1712
00:59:16,049 --> 00:59:18,648
(Who does So Min think liked her more?)

1713
00:59:18,649 --> 00:59:19,747
Ha Seok Jin.

1714
00:59:19,748 --> 00:59:22,011
(She chooses Seok Jin.)

1715
00:59:23,388 --> 00:59:25,687
- So Min, are you moving on? - No,

1716
00:59:25,688 --> 00:59:27,557
- Because you had dates with me? - No, that's not it.

1717
00:59:27,558 --> 00:59:29,997
- That's it! - No, it's not!

1718
00:59:29,998 --> 00:59:31,198
I'll call you.

1719
00:59:31,199 --> 00:59:33,097
- I'll call you later. - Don't. Call him first!

1720
00:59:33,098 --> 00:59:34,227
I'm sorry.

1721
00:59:34,228 --> 00:59:35,568
I'm serious, don't call me.

1722
00:59:35,569 --> 00:59:38,068
- Text me. - Come on.

1723
00:59:38,069 --> 00:59:41,099
Why am I feeling so bad over this?

1724
00:59:42,069 --> 00:59:44,362
- What do I do? - What should I do with this Jenga?

1725
00:59:44,609 --> 00:59:45,750
You should try your best.

1726
00:59:45,879 --> 00:59:47,394
What are you going to do?

1727
00:59:47,578 --> 00:59:49,093
I thought it would collapse here.

1728
00:59:49,109 --> 00:59:50,218
Which one should I pull out?

1729
00:59:50,219 --> 00:59:51,734
You'll find it if you closely look.

1730
00:59:52,049 --> 00:59:53,187
Let's see.

1731
00:59:53,188 --> 00:59:54,588
Piling it is the problem.

1732
00:59:54,589 --> 00:59:56,117
- Wait. - As you pull it out...

1733
00:59:56,118 --> 00:59:57,418
What are you doing?

1734
00:59:57,419 --> 00:59:59,680
(He hugs her from the back.)

1735
01:00:00,958 --> 01:00:03,827
(Ji Suk, are you cheating?)

1736
01:00:03,929 --> 01:00:06,198
Wait a minute.

1737
01:00:06,199 --> 01:00:07,997
(Jenga is nothing if I'm with you.)

1738
01:00:07,998 --> 01:00:09,211
Take a photo of us.

1739
01:00:09,998 --> 01:00:11,312
- Can you go forward? - Send it to them.

1740
01:00:11,569 --> 01:00:13,325
Send it to Se Chan and Kwang Soo.

1741
01:00:14,109 --> 01:00:15,807
- So Min. - I got it.

1742
01:00:15,808 --> 01:00:17,222
(He pulls one out.)

1743
01:00:19,879 --> 01:00:22,148
- He pulled it out well. - Ji Suk.

1744
01:00:22,149 --> 01:00:23,259
This is the power of love.

1745
01:00:23,419 --> 01:00:24,994
That was amazing just now.

1746
01:00:27,149 --> 01:00:28,148
(He even piles up another one with the power of love.)

1747
01:00:28,149 --> 01:00:29,299
He did it.

1748
01:00:30,458 --> 01:00:32,175
(You look cool today.)

1749
01:00:32,259 --> 01:00:33,258
I will ask...

1750
01:00:33,259 --> 01:00:34,602
- a hard question. - Okay.

1751
01:00:36,529 --> 01:00:38,073
Based on your opinion,

1752
01:00:38,629 --> 01:00:40,968
with whom do you look better in a photo?

1753
01:00:40,969 --> 01:00:42,746
(Ji Suk's question)

1754
01:00:42,799 --> 01:00:43,849
Shall we try it?

1755
01:00:45,899 --> 01:00:47,238
Can you get us on camera?

1756
01:00:47,239 --> 01:00:49,491
(Can you get us together on camera?)

1757
01:00:52,578 --> 01:00:56,345
(Ji Suk and So Min are a top star couple.)

1758
01:00:56,679 --> 01:00:57,948
How about us?

1759
01:00:57,949 --> 01:01:00,372
(She takes a photo with Seok Jin as well.)

1760
01:01:02,188 --> 01:01:05,319
(So Min and Seok Jin are 1 percent couple.)

1761
01:01:05,419 --> 01:01:07,488
My goodness, I look good with both of them.

1762
01:01:07,489 --> 01:01:08,841
(They're neck and neck.)

1763
01:01:09,589 --> 01:01:10,928
1, 2, 3.

1764
01:01:10,929 --> 01:01:16,252
(Which one does So Min think matches her better?)

1765
01:01:17,098 --> 01:01:18,198
Kim Ji Suk.

1766
01:01:18,199 --> 01:01:19,885
(She finally picks Ji Suk.)

1767
01:01:20,609 --> 01:01:22,168
(Is it the effect of his hug from the back?)

1768
01:01:22,169 --> 01:01:23,290
Really?

1769
01:01:23,779 --> 01:01:25,759
- Why? Why? - What?

1770
01:01:26,879 --> 01:01:29,247
(Doesn't it upset you?)

1771
01:01:29,248 --> 01:01:30,418
Here's why.

1772
01:01:30,419 --> 01:01:33,004
I thought I looked good with you before.

1773
01:01:33,118 --> 01:01:34,704
A lot of time passed.

1774
01:01:35,589 --> 01:01:38,588
We recently finished shooting a drama together.

1775
01:01:38,658 --> 01:01:39,957
If I say that...

1776
01:01:39,958 --> 01:01:41,187
- we look better together... - The warmth still remains.

1777
01:01:41,188 --> 01:01:43,381
If I say that we look better together,

1778
01:01:43,598 --> 01:01:49,867
more people might watch our drama again.

1779
01:01:49,868 --> 01:01:51,919
(Is that why you chose me?)

1780
01:01:51,938 --> 01:01:53,097
It just gave me goosebumps.

1781
01:01:53,098 --> 01:01:54,320
So is it for business?

1782
01:01:54,808 --> 01:01:56,222
Is this a business?

1783
01:01:56,469 --> 01:01:58,338
- That's great too. - Right?

1784
01:01:58,339 --> 01:02:00,531
(It's great as long as I'm chosen.)

1785
01:02:00,578 --> 01:02:02,807
Our drama "Something About 1 Percent" had...

1786
01:02:02,808 --> 01:02:05,048
so many reruns.

1787
01:02:05,049 --> 01:02:07,170
Now it's time to support "Top Star U-back".

1788
01:02:07,819 --> 01:02:10,344
- I understand. - What will you do about this?

1789
01:02:10,658 --> 01:02:12,387
- The result depends... - Now...

1790
01:02:12,388 --> 01:02:14,913
- on this round. - it's almost over.

1791
01:02:15,029 --> 01:02:17,128
I bet you'll make it.

1792
01:02:17,129 --> 01:02:19,381
No, it's too unstable on the top.

1793
01:02:19,429 --> 01:02:20,898
(Shaking)

1794
01:02:20,899 --> 01:02:21,898
Wait.

1795
01:02:21,899 --> 01:02:23,028
(It's too unstable.)

1796
01:02:23,029 --> 01:02:24,785
- Watch. - Let's see.

1797
01:02:25,469 --> 01:02:26,738
(He picks a block to pull out.)

1798
01:02:26,739 --> 01:02:28,355
It will be difficult to pile it up.

1799
01:02:29,469 --> 01:02:31,437
Gosh, that's enough.

1800
01:02:31,438 --> 01:02:33,278
(He pulls it out successfully.)

1801
01:02:33,279 --> 01:02:35,500
Gosh, that's enough.

1802
01:02:35,848 --> 01:02:38,218
They aren't fighting over me.

1803
01:02:38,219 --> 01:02:40,017
They're just being competitive.

1804
01:02:40,018 --> 01:02:42,617
(Did she just realize that they're just being competitive?)

1805
01:02:42,618 --> 01:02:43,971
It makes me feel...

1806
01:02:44,419 --> 01:02:45,918
bad little by little.

1807
01:02:45,919 --> 01:02:46,968
(Are they here to compete?)

1808
01:02:48,359 --> 01:02:51,358
This is difficult. Try it.

1809
01:02:51,359 --> 01:02:53,827
(Seok Jin defends successfully if he piles it up.)

1810
01:02:53,828 --> 01:02:55,597
(He piles it.)

1811
01:02:55,598 --> 01:02:58,195
(Then it collapsed.)

1812
01:03:00,239 --> 01:03:01,668
(Seok Jin loses the competition.)

1813
01:03:01,669 --> 01:03:02,807
I thought I got it.

1814
01:03:02,808 --> 01:03:04,477
- You put it with too much force. - I thought you got it too.

1815
01:03:04,478 --> 01:03:05,577
(Their competition ends.)

1816
01:03:05,578 --> 01:03:06,608
It's over now.

1817
01:03:06,609 --> 01:03:09,008
It was a game to get to know each other.

1818
01:03:09,009 --> 01:03:10,292
Let's go to the cart.

1819
01:03:10,379 --> 01:03:11,678
- I'll choose. - Yes.

1820
01:03:11,679 --> 01:03:12,818
You will choose.

1821
01:03:12,819 --> 01:03:15,071
(They move to the cart track.)

1822
01:03:15,888 --> 01:03:18,080
It's time to make your final decision.

1823
01:03:18,589 --> 01:03:20,345
This is too difficult.

1824
01:03:21,388 --> 01:03:23,428
(Chosen by So Min versus abandoned by So Min)

1825
01:03:23,429 --> 01:03:25,579
Please sit in your cart.

1826
01:03:25,759 --> 01:03:27,367
Okay, where should we sit?

1827
01:03:27,368 --> 01:03:29,068
It's cold. Button up.

1828
01:03:29,069 --> 01:03:30,452
(He acts sweet suddenly.)

1829
01:03:30,669 --> 01:03:31,767
(He makes a sweet comment full of trickery.)

1830
01:03:31,768 --> 01:03:33,486
- Goodness. - It's cold.

1831
01:03:33,638 --> 01:03:35,153
It's cold, it's cold.

1832
01:03:35,208 --> 01:03:36,380
This is what he does.

1833
01:03:37,379 --> 01:03:38,437
He's good at that.

1834
01:03:38,438 --> 01:03:39,589
(Two men are very different.)

1835
01:03:40,578 --> 01:03:42,973
(It gets harder for So Min to decide.)

1836
01:03:43,049 --> 01:03:45,069
It's too difficult.

1837
01:03:46,149 --> 01:03:47,247
I feel like I'm in trouble.

1838
01:03:47,248 --> 01:03:49,773
(Which one will be her last date?)

1839
01:03:54,458 --> 01:03:57,832
(First man is Ha Seok Jin.)

1840
01:03:58,299 --> 01:03:59,370
Seok Jin.

1841
01:04:00,199 --> 01:04:01,916
(It's been a long time.)

1842
01:04:02,069 --> 01:04:05,331
(There's warmth in his words that he says carelessly.)

1843
01:04:05,469 --> 01:04:09,407
(His warmth makes So Min fall for him without realizing it.)

1844
01:04:09,408 --> 01:04:13,448
(Ha Seok Jin, the man of her fate.)

1845
01:04:14,379 --> 01:04:16,772
(Or...)

1846
01:04:18,179 --> 01:04:20,818
(Just by seeing him makes her laugh.)

1847
01:04:20,819 --> 01:04:23,557
(He's the sweetest man.)

1848
01:04:23,558 --> 01:04:25,517
(He gets playful like a friend.)

1849
01:04:25,518 --> 01:04:27,758
(He puts So Min at ease.)

1850
01:04:27,759 --> 01:04:29,858
(He arrives at the beginning of her date.)

1851
01:04:29,859 --> 01:04:32,080
(Kim Ji Suk, a man So Min was meant to meet)

1852
01:04:32,728 --> 01:04:37,011
(She hands something to Ji Suk.)

1853
01:04:37,098 --> 01:04:38,137
Ji Suk.

1854
01:04:38,138 --> 01:04:40,663
(Is it a heating pad?)

1855
01:04:41,609 --> 01:04:43,801
Take it since it's cold.

1856
01:04:43,978 --> 01:04:45,120
It's okay.

1857
01:04:45,208 --> 01:04:46,407
I don't need a heating pad.

1858
01:04:46,408 --> 01:04:47,489
- Why not? - It's okay.

1859
01:04:47,609 --> 01:04:50,077
(So Min feels bad for him in the cold.)

1860
01:04:50,078 --> 01:04:51,897
You should take a heating pad.

1861
01:04:52,018 --> 01:04:54,615
(She hands a heating pad to Seok Jin as well.)

1862
01:04:55,989 --> 01:04:58,483
(What's going on?)

1863
01:05:00,359 --> 01:05:03,056
(He ends up seeing who she has chosen.)

1864
01:05:04,658 --> 01:05:07,860
(So Min chooses Seok Jin.)

1865
01:05:08,728 --> 01:05:10,997
(Seok Jin is relieved.)

1866
01:05:10,998 --> 01:05:13,238
I didn't think she would make me happy.

1867
01:05:13,239 --> 01:05:14,420
I feel great.

1868
01:05:15,768 --> 01:05:17,526
I'm sorry, Ji Suk.

1869
01:05:17,538 --> 01:05:19,238
Yi Kyung.

1870
01:05:19,239 --> 01:05:20,663
(He thinks of Yi Kyung.)

1871
01:05:21,408 --> 01:05:23,648
(I'm sorry about what I did.)

1872
01:05:23,649 --> 01:05:27,223
So Min chose Seok Jin.

1873
01:05:27,489 --> 01:05:31,125
The two of them will have a date on Love Love Cart.

1874
01:05:31,788 --> 01:05:33,588
Both teams will complete one round of the track.

1875
01:05:33,589 --> 01:05:36,416
So Min and Seok Jin must arrive first to win.

1876
01:05:37,859 --> 01:05:39,110
What if they don't win?

1877
01:05:39,158 --> 01:05:41,198
They have to compete until they win.

1878
01:05:41,199 --> 01:05:42,767
(If Seok Jin and So Min lose, they must keep competing.)

1879
01:05:42,768 --> 01:05:43,850
If we fail?

1880
01:05:44,199 --> 01:05:45,298
We should go fast.

1881
01:05:45,299 --> 01:05:46,854
(Will So Min be able to get to her next date spot safely?)

1882
01:05:48,938 --> 01:05:50,608
(I'll show you the strength of single.)

1883
01:05:50,609 --> 01:05:51,921
Seok Jin.

1884
01:05:52,609 --> 01:05:55,679
(They're happy and cheerful.)

1885
01:05:56,009 --> 01:05:57,977
(He's charged with anger.)

1886
01:05:57,978 --> 01:06:00,210
(The two men's pride depends on the cart race.)

1887
01:06:01,149 --> 01:06:02,331
We can do it.

1888
01:06:06,458 --> 01:06:08,887
(Ji Suk represents singles, and his engine sound is full of anger.)

1889
01:06:08,888 --> 01:06:10,298
(Seok Jin represents couples, and he's relaxed.)

1890
01:06:10,299 --> 01:06:11,410
It's fast.

1891
01:06:11,629 --> 01:06:12,798
It's fast.

1892
01:06:12,799 --> 01:06:14,788
(They speed up from the beginning.)

1893
01:06:15,169 --> 01:06:16,380
It's very fast.

1894
01:06:18,598 --> 01:06:21,033
(Mad Max: Road of Fury)

1895
01:06:23,109 --> 01:06:24,451
(Bumping)

1896
01:06:26,138 --> 01:06:28,148
(Laughing in surprise)

1897
01:06:28,149 --> 01:06:31,047
(Singles can be scary.)

1898
01:06:31,449 --> 01:06:35,054
(Ji Suk speeds up and don't care about the gap between them.)

1899
01:06:36,089 --> 01:06:38,240
(He's right after them.)

1900
01:06:38,489 --> 01:06:41,215
(Ji Suk becomes bold and tries to outrun them.)

1901
01:06:41,688 --> 01:06:44,057
(They get surprised while having a conversation.)

1902
01:06:44,058 --> 01:06:46,428
(It's the last corner before the finish line.)

1903
01:06:46,429 --> 01:06:48,651
(This is the last chance.)

1904
01:06:49,728 --> 01:06:52,367
(Did Ji Suk get on the inside lane?)

1905
01:06:52,368 --> 01:06:55,738
(It's his last chance to interrupt Seok Jin and So Min's date.)

1906
01:06:55,739 --> 01:06:59,415
(Will Ji Suk be able to outrun Seok Jin?)

1907
01:07:00,408 --> 01:07:01,520
(Spinning)

1908
01:07:01,748 --> 01:07:04,606
(Ji Suk stops after spinning.)

1909
01:07:05,818 --> 01:07:08,287
(Next to a smiling couple that passes by,)

1910
01:07:08,288 --> 01:07:10,510
(the representative of singles collapses.)

1911
01:07:11,919 --> 01:07:13,909
(Crying)

1912
01:07:14,729 --> 01:07:15,787
(I'm sorry, but we're leaving.)

1913
01:07:15,788 --> 01:07:16,909
Look.

1914
01:07:17,158 --> 01:07:18,258
We ditched him.

1915
01:07:18,259 --> 01:07:20,157
(Without a surprise,)

1916
01:07:20,158 --> 01:07:22,497
(the couple wins.)

1917
01:07:22,498 --> 01:07:25,867
(They go to their final date as they win.)

1918
01:07:25,868 --> 01:07:27,283
I thought he was going to outrun us.

1919
01:07:27,568 --> 01:07:29,968
I'll charge it to Jong Kook.

1920
01:07:29,969 --> 01:07:31,191
(What's their next date?)

1921
01:07:32,509 --> 01:07:34,599
- Let's start. - Start.

1922
01:07:35,179 --> 01:07:36,218
Let's go.

1923
01:07:36,278 --> 01:07:38,470
Get ready.

1924
01:07:38,578 --> 01:07:41,117
(The first player is Kwang Soo again.)

1925
01:07:41,118 --> 01:07:42,548
(What?)

1926
01:07:42,549 --> 01:07:45,720
(He improved in a short period of time.)

1927
01:07:45,818 --> 01:07:47,588
It's a huge pile.

1928
01:07:47,589 --> 01:07:49,750
(Kwang Soo carries a huge amount.)

1929
01:07:50,599 --> 01:07:51,857
That's a lot.

1930
01:07:51,858 --> 01:07:53,687
(At this rate, he could succeed.)

1931
01:07:54,599 --> 01:07:56,697
(Being careful)

1932
01:07:56,698 --> 01:07:58,011
It's not bad.

1933
01:07:58,568 --> 01:07:59,650
Hurry.

1934
01:07:59,898 --> 01:08:01,668
Speed is more important.

1935
01:08:01,669 --> 01:08:04,871
(Kwang Soo shows off his skill while Yi Kyung moves it.)

1936
01:08:05,839 --> 01:08:07,447
(Seok Jin also does a good job.)

1937
01:08:07,448 --> 01:08:08,747
It's half filled.

1938
01:08:08,748 --> 01:08:12,213
(They succeed if they transfer a little more.)

1939
01:08:12,349 --> 01:08:14,914
We'll make it. It'll be possible.

1940
01:08:16,448 --> 01:08:18,088
(They have 15 seconds left.)

1941
01:08:18,089 --> 01:08:19,258
It's the last one. You're almost there.

1942
01:08:19,259 --> 01:08:20,541
We're almost done.

1943
01:08:22,028 --> 01:08:25,457
(This is the last pile of flour.)

1944
01:08:25,458 --> 01:08:28,397
(Will they fill it up and succeed?)

1945
01:08:28,398 --> 01:08:29,997
5, 4.

1946
01:08:29,998 --> 01:08:31,168
(What will be the result?)

1947
01:08:31,169 --> 01:08:32,987
- I think we'll make it. - 3, 2.

1948
01:08:38,379 --> 01:08:40,747
(They've finally made it.)

1949
01:08:40,748 --> 01:08:43,980
(They've filled more than half of the cup.)

1950
01:08:44,379 --> 01:08:46,117
You cleared the mission.

1951
01:08:46,118 --> 01:08:47,447
(Mission cleared)

1952
01:08:47,448 --> 01:08:48,647
(They made it.)

1953
01:08:48,648 --> 01:08:49,861
That was amazing.

1954
01:08:50,559 --> 01:08:52,679
- Tell us where So Min is now. - Hurry.

1955
01:08:52,689 --> 01:08:54,073
- Everyone. - Yes.

1956
01:08:54,129 --> 01:08:57,462
You can find So Min with this GPS tracker.

1957
01:08:57,599 --> 01:08:59,758
Track her down with it.

1958
01:08:59,759 --> 01:09:01,567
- Let's go now. - We should go there.

1959
01:09:01,568 --> 01:09:03,838
You'll succeed if you eliminate So Min's name tag.

1960
01:09:03,839 --> 01:09:04,950
Let's hurry. Let's go.

1961
01:09:06,568 --> 01:09:08,255
(GPS tracking starts.)

1962
01:09:09,208 --> 01:09:10,551
Let's catch her now.

1963
01:09:10,879 --> 01:09:12,107
Let's tear off her name tag.

1964
01:09:12,108 --> 01:09:14,048
Someone should run after her when we get there.

1965
01:09:14,049 --> 01:09:15,392
Tear off her name tag immediately.

1966
01:09:15,408 --> 01:09:17,095
Catch her and tear it off.

1967
01:09:17,448 --> 01:09:19,035
- I'll tear it off with my teeth. - Okay.

1968
01:09:19,778 --> 01:09:21,088
Yi Kyung is angry.

1969
01:09:21,089 --> 01:09:22,564
Let Yi Kyung do it.

1970
01:09:23,148 --> 01:09:24,603
Can you see where she is on the GPS tracker?

1971
01:09:24,759 --> 01:09:26,032
See if she's moving.

1972
01:09:26,089 --> 01:09:27,240
She's moving.

1973
01:09:27,958 --> 01:09:30,352
So Min hasn't called us once.

1974
01:09:30,559 --> 01:09:32,174
(At that moment)

1975
01:09:33,158 --> 01:09:34,240
So Min.

1976
01:09:34,629 --> 01:09:37,268
(Did So Min call them finally?)

1977
01:09:37,269 --> 01:09:38,298
- What? - Be careful.

1978
01:09:38,299 --> 01:09:39,481
Is she on the phone?

1979
01:09:40,839 --> 01:09:42,537
- We're on our way. - I think she called him.

1980
01:09:42,538 --> 01:09:43,737
(So Min suddenly calls Yi Kyung.)

1981
01:09:43,738 --> 01:09:44,788
Are you happy?

1982
01:09:44,879 --> 01:09:46,737
Here's Seok Jin. Wait.

1983
01:09:46,738 --> 01:09:47,808
Give me the phone.

1984
01:09:47,809 --> 01:09:48,848
Who is it?

1985
01:09:48,849 --> 01:09:50,021
So Min.

1986
01:09:50,248 --> 01:09:51,617
- Hasn't it been too long... - So Min.

1987
01:09:51,618 --> 01:09:52,861
- Ask where she is. - since she called us?

1988
01:09:53,849 --> 01:09:55,031
Come here, Yi Kyung.

1989
01:09:55,118 --> 01:09:56,200
What's this?

1990
01:09:56,648 --> 01:09:59,083
(The call was a joke.)

1991
01:09:59,259 --> 01:10:01,258
It's his first time on Running Man.

1992
01:10:01,259 --> 01:10:02,744
Seok Jin got duped by Yi Kyung.

1993
01:10:03,089 --> 01:10:04,098
Hey!

1994
01:10:04,099 --> 01:10:05,527
(Seok Jin isn't experienced at all.)

1995
01:10:05,528 --> 01:10:07,317
Yi Kyung, why you...

1996
01:10:07,929 --> 01:10:09,468
- My goodness. - Sorry.

1997
01:10:09,469 --> 01:10:11,397
It would be strange if she called.

1998
01:10:11,398 --> 01:10:12,968
Ji Suk is calling me.

1999
01:10:12,969 --> 01:10:14,282
- Is he? - Yes.

2000
01:10:14,608 --> 01:10:15,719
Hello?

2001
01:10:16,009 --> 01:10:19,907
This is Ji Suk burning with desire for revenge.

2002
01:10:19,908 --> 01:10:21,261
Did So Min abandon you?

2003
01:10:21,549 --> 01:10:22,678
Ji Suk as well?

2004
01:10:22,679 --> 01:10:24,218
Did So Min ditch you?

2005
01:10:24,219 --> 01:10:25,518
Goodness.

2006
01:10:25,519 --> 01:10:27,247
I think she dumped him too.

2007
01:10:27,248 --> 01:10:28,388
Goodness.

2008
01:10:28,389 --> 01:10:30,888
How could So Min change like that?

2009
01:10:30,889 --> 01:10:31,918
Is she usually like this?

2010
01:10:31,919 --> 01:10:34,457
I had no idea. We shot a drama for six months.

2011
01:10:34,458 --> 01:10:36,657
I didn't know she was such changeable.

2012
01:10:36,658 --> 01:10:38,128
He's very angry.

2013
01:10:38,129 --> 01:10:40,452
Seriously. I'm shocked.

2014
01:10:40,729 --> 01:10:43,830
(I know exactly how you feel.)

2015
01:10:44,538 --> 01:10:46,386
- Ji Suk. - I'll come find you.

2016
01:10:46,568 --> 01:10:48,528
- See you soon. - Okay.

2017
01:10:48,708 --> 01:10:49,838
Okay.

2018
01:10:49,839 --> 01:10:52,060
(He used to be a sweet man, but he's not over her.)

2019
01:10:52,879 --> 01:10:53,947
So Min.

2020
01:10:53,948 --> 01:10:55,191
I will tear off...

2021
01:10:55,408 --> 01:10:56,923
your name tag.

2022
01:10:57,719 --> 01:10:59,478
I bet Ji Suk is sulky now.

2023
01:10:59,479 --> 01:11:00,848
(Her prediction is correct.)

2024
01:11:00,849 --> 01:11:04,222
- He gets sulky easily. - He does.

2025
01:11:04,618 --> 01:11:06,188
He was disappointed when he left.

2026
01:11:06,189 --> 01:11:07,457
Why didn't you choose him?

2027
01:11:07,458 --> 01:11:08,688
(So that he isn't sulky?)

2028
01:11:08,689 --> 01:11:10,827
I picked you to keep you here.

2029
01:11:10,828 --> 01:11:13,258
(Everyone is chasing after Seok Jin.)

2030
01:11:13,259 --> 01:11:14,541
This is so funny.

2031
01:11:15,398 --> 01:11:16,913
We arrived in Hyeri.

2032
01:11:18,799 --> 01:11:21,839
(They arrive at the last dating spot.)

2033
01:11:22,439 --> 01:11:23,508
Let's go.

2034
01:11:23,509 --> 01:11:25,357
(Let's go on a date.)

2035
01:11:25,979 --> 01:11:28,008
Go to three spots in the photos.

2036
01:11:28,009 --> 01:11:30,277
They're hidden in your last dating spot.

2037
01:11:30,278 --> 01:11:32,572
Take a selfie at each spot. That's how you complete each mission.

2038
01:11:32,979 --> 01:11:35,487
- Shall we walk faster? - Do we have to run?

2039
01:11:35,488 --> 01:11:36,888
We never know, so let's walk fast.

2040
01:11:36,889 --> 01:11:38,807
What if we get caught?

2041
01:11:39,089 --> 01:11:41,482
When a group of cameras arrives,

2042
01:11:41,958 --> 01:11:44,018
we can run away then, can't we?

2043
01:11:44,299 --> 01:11:46,419
- They're very fast. - Really?

2044
01:11:46,498 --> 01:11:48,720
It's over once we see them.

2045
01:11:49,528 --> 01:11:50,750
That's how it will be.

2046
01:11:50,939 --> 01:11:52,716
We're here. Here it is.

2047
01:11:52,769 --> 01:11:54,081
It's Hyeri.

2048
01:11:54,439 --> 01:11:57,711
(They arrive at Hyeri where So Min and Seok Jin are on a date.)

2049
01:11:57,979 --> 01:11:59,191
Look at the GPS tracker.

2050
01:11:59,509 --> 01:12:01,378
- Let's see. - We have to go up north.

2051
01:12:01,379 --> 01:12:02,907
- Really? - Yes.

2052
01:12:02,908 --> 01:12:04,147
We caught them.

2053
01:12:04,148 --> 01:12:05,548
We got them. Who is this?

2054
01:12:05,549 --> 01:12:07,770
- It's over for So Min. - We caught her.

2055
01:12:08,189 --> 01:12:10,642
What kind of date is this?

2056
01:12:11,019 --> 01:12:13,008
We should be able to talk.

2057
01:12:13,958 --> 01:12:16,252
Shouldn't we have time to look around and walk?

2058
01:12:16,429 --> 01:12:18,549
- Where is she? - She's very nearby.

2059
01:12:18,629 --> 01:12:20,649
- Really? - She's very near.

2060
01:12:20,868 --> 01:12:23,197
- Based on the GPS, she's behind... - Behind?

2061
01:12:23,198 --> 01:12:25,298
- I think so. - Go to the back.

2062
01:12:25,299 --> 01:12:27,168
We're in a hurry, so this isn't a date.

2063
01:12:27,169 --> 01:12:28,607
(They haven't cleared one mission.)

2064
01:12:28,608 --> 01:12:29,983
There's one.

2065
01:12:30,139 --> 01:12:31,808
Isn't that one of them?

2066
01:12:31,809 --> 01:12:32,838
Look.

2067
01:12:32,839 --> 01:12:34,061
This is it.

2068
01:12:34,479 --> 01:12:35,747
- This is it. Hello. - Hello.

2069
01:12:35,748 --> 01:12:36,777
You've found here.

2070
01:12:36,778 --> 01:12:38,048
Here it is.

2071
01:12:38,049 --> 01:12:39,247
Thank you.

2072
01:12:39,248 --> 01:12:40,532
- Here you go. - Thank you.

2073
01:12:40,748 --> 01:12:41,987
(Let's have a date while being chased.)

2074
01:12:41,988 --> 01:12:43,634
1, 2, 3.

2075
01:12:45,059 --> 01:12:49,188
(They clear the first mission.)

2076
01:12:49,189 --> 01:12:50,401
Come this way, Seok Jin.

2077
01:12:50,559 --> 01:12:51,957
Let's go this way.

2078
01:12:51,958 --> 01:12:53,949
Isn't this it? Look, where's the car?

2079
01:12:54,169 --> 01:12:55,968
(They head to...)

2080
01:12:55,969 --> 01:13:00,240
(their next destination.)

2081
01:13:00,669 --> 01:13:01,668
What's this?

2082
01:13:01,669 --> 01:13:03,207
- What? - They're right in front of us.

2083
01:13:03,208 --> 01:13:05,663
Jae Seok, park the car right here.

2084
01:13:05,708 --> 01:13:07,294
Let's walk around.

2085
01:13:07,408 --> 01:13:09,378
Let's get off here first.

2086
01:13:09,379 --> 01:13:10,777
- I know. - Shall we get out?

2087
01:13:10,778 --> 01:13:12,478
- Get out. - Get out?

2088
01:13:12,479 --> 01:13:14,188
(Shall we go catch her?)

2089
01:13:14,189 --> 01:13:15,747
Where is she on the tracker?

2090
01:13:15,748 --> 01:13:17,258
Do you see the stream in the front?

2091
01:13:17,259 --> 01:13:18,857
- Cross it. - We must cross it.

2092
01:13:18,858 --> 01:13:19,888
- That way? - Right.

2093
01:13:19,889 --> 01:13:21,141
Wait for me.

2094
01:13:22,288 --> 01:13:23,287
Wait for me.

2095
01:13:23,288 --> 01:13:24,397
Ji Suk.

2096
01:13:24,398 --> 01:13:27,268
(Someone cries to stop Team Chasers.)

2097
01:13:27,269 --> 01:13:28,712
Ji Suk.

2098
01:13:29,498 --> 01:13:31,397
- Are you okay? - I'm sorry about what happened.

2099
01:13:31,398 --> 01:13:33,037
- Ji Suk. - Yi Kyung.

2100
01:13:33,038 --> 01:13:35,067
- I understand how you feel. - Ji Suk.

2101
01:13:35,068 --> 01:13:36,453
It's all right.

2102
01:13:36,608 --> 01:13:38,237
I'm full of vengeance.

2103
01:13:38,238 --> 01:13:40,330
They're men duped by So Min.

2104
01:13:40,979 --> 01:13:43,107
- After eating... - Is this how it felt?

2105
01:13:43,108 --> 01:13:44,277
- Don't even mention it. - Let's hurry.

2106
01:13:44,278 --> 01:13:45,447
Let's catch her.

2107
01:13:45,448 --> 01:13:47,570
So Min made many cry. What does the GPS tracker tell?

2108
01:13:47,719 --> 01:13:49,787
We're over here, and So Min is here.

2109
01:13:49,788 --> 01:13:51,117
Is it the other side?

2110
01:13:51,118 --> 01:13:53,058
Yes, it's by the container.

2111
01:13:53,059 --> 01:13:55,388
- With the train track. - In the background?

2112
01:13:55,389 --> 01:13:56,842
With this in the background?

2113
01:13:57,658 --> 01:14:01,972
(They're on a date without realizing that they're being chased.)

2114
01:14:03,129 --> 01:14:04,438
We have one left.

2115
01:14:04,439 --> 01:14:05,537
(They clear the second mission.)

2116
01:14:05,538 --> 01:14:07,707
(If they clear the last mission, Seok Jin and So Min win.)

2117
01:14:07,708 --> 01:14:09,790
I don't know where the giraffe is.

2118
01:14:10,469 --> 01:14:13,107
I haven't seen a giraffe here.

2119
01:14:13,108 --> 01:14:15,178
(They haven't found their last mission spot.)

2120
01:14:15,179 --> 01:14:16,663
Let's go to the bigger road.

2121
01:14:17,379 --> 01:14:20,348
(Team Chasers are searching everywhere.)

2122
01:14:20,349 --> 01:14:22,307
- Have you seen So Min? - Here?

2123
01:14:22,419 --> 01:14:24,718
- They went this way. - It's this way.

2124
01:14:24,719 --> 01:14:26,817
(A passerby gives them an important hint.)

2125
01:14:26,818 --> 01:14:28,303
This way?

2126
01:14:28,788 --> 01:14:29,940
Really?

2127
01:14:30,799 --> 01:14:31,857
We don't have time.

2128
01:14:31,858 --> 01:14:33,397
I can sense it.

2129
01:14:33,398 --> 01:14:34,428
Where is she?

2130
01:14:34,429 --> 01:14:35,468
(Will they run away or get caught?)

2131
01:14:35,469 --> 01:14:36,468
I think they're here.

2132
01:14:36,469 --> 01:14:38,186
There they are.

2133
01:14:38,269 --> 01:14:40,491
Run to the opposite side.

2134
01:14:41,439 --> 01:14:42,721
My goodness.

2135
01:14:43,309 --> 01:14:45,601
They don't care about the shoot. It's all about catching her.

2136
01:14:45,708 --> 01:14:46,938
We must catch her first.

2137
01:14:46,939 --> 01:14:48,393
Everyone's eyes look determined.

2138
01:14:48,448 --> 01:14:50,025
It's frightening here.

2139
01:14:50,148 --> 01:14:51,947
It's really frightening.

2140
01:14:51,948 --> 01:14:53,048
(It's a battlefield.)

2141
01:14:53,049 --> 01:14:54,433
We'll see the giraffe.

2142
01:14:54,948 --> 01:14:56,261
We'll see it...

2143
01:14:56,318 --> 01:14:57,588
since it has a long neck.

2144
01:14:57,589 --> 01:14:58,771
(They're looking for the giraffe in the photo.)

2145
01:14:59,488 --> 01:15:01,558
I'm afraid that I'll see Kwang Soo first.

2146
01:15:01,559 --> 01:15:02,827
I'm very scared.

2147
01:15:02,828 --> 01:15:05,997
It'll be finished if we see Kwang Soo or Jong Kook.

2148
01:15:05,998 --> 01:15:07,989
- Aren't they very fast? - They're very fast.

2149
01:15:08,368 --> 01:15:09,468
(They only need to clear one more.)

2150
01:15:09,469 --> 01:15:10,610
Let's take the stairs.

2151
01:15:10,898 --> 01:15:12,367
There they are!

2152
01:15:12,368 --> 01:15:13,985
(There they are!)

2153
01:15:14,068 --> 01:15:16,407
(They're right behind them.)

2154
01:15:16,408 --> 01:15:19,207
- No! - My goodness. Run.

2155
01:15:19,339 --> 01:15:20,577
There they are!

2156
01:15:20,578 --> 01:15:21,747
- Where? - In front of us.

2157
01:15:21,748 --> 01:15:23,077
- There they are. - In front of us.

2158
01:15:23,078 --> 01:15:24,577
(Two men with broken hearts)

2159
01:15:24,578 --> 01:15:28,689
(They run forward very fast.)

2160
01:15:29,148 --> 01:15:31,643
(Everything will be over once we get caught.)

2161
01:15:32,458 --> 01:15:34,388
- Wait. - They're very fast.

2162
01:15:34,389 --> 01:15:35,873
I'm done for.

2163
01:15:37,328 --> 01:15:38,457
They're ahead of us.

2164
01:15:38,458 --> 01:15:40,657
(Just wait until we catch you.)

2165
01:15:40,658 --> 01:15:41,697
So Min.

2166
01:15:41,698 --> 01:15:43,749
Run. We must run away.

2167
01:15:44,238 --> 01:15:46,668
- Hey. - Enjoy the present.

2168
01:15:46,669 --> 01:15:48,082
(He mumbles while gripping his jaw.)

2169
01:15:48,469 --> 01:15:49,537
The giraffe.

2170
01:15:49,538 --> 01:15:50,578
(At that time)

2171
01:15:51,379 --> 01:15:52,490
Where's the giraffe?

2172
01:15:52,708 --> 01:15:53,907
There it is.

2173
01:15:53,908 --> 01:15:55,766
(They find the giraffe statue.)

2174
01:15:56,748 --> 01:15:58,077
I think...

2175
01:15:58,078 --> 01:15:59,897
So Min has a mission over there.

2176
01:16:00,419 --> 01:16:01,832
Eliminate her name tag.

2177
01:16:03,389 --> 01:16:06,388
(Seok Jin and So Min get close to the final spot.)

2178
01:16:06,658 --> 01:16:09,787
(They clear the mission once they take a photo.)

2179
01:16:09,788 --> 01:16:10,798
(However)

2180
01:16:10,799 --> 01:16:12,197
Tear it off, Yi Kyung.

2181
01:16:12,198 --> 01:16:13,643
(Tear it off, Yi Kyung.)

2182
01:16:14,929 --> 01:16:15,968
It's the giraffe.

2183
01:16:15,969 --> 01:16:18,564
- Tear it off. - No.

2184
01:16:18,769 --> 01:16:20,829
Wait a minute.

2185
01:16:20,939 --> 01:16:22,181
Wait.

2186
01:16:22,309 --> 01:16:23,319
Stop.

2187
01:16:23,738 --> 01:16:24,788
Tear it off.

2188
01:16:24,839 --> 01:16:26,829
- Tear it off. - Wait.

2189
01:16:28,309 --> 01:16:32,117
(Today is So Min's Birthday Special.)

2190
01:16:32,118 --> 01:16:34,487
(It was her big wish.)

2191
01:16:34,488 --> 01:16:37,857
(She became the center of passionate romance.)

2192
01:16:37,858 --> 01:16:40,317
(With men she had feelings for,)

2193
01:16:40,318 --> 01:16:45,058
(it was a day full of laughter.)

2194
01:16:45,059 --> 01:16:46,728
(Where did it go wrong?)

2195
01:16:46,729 --> 01:16:47,879
Wait.

2196
01:16:47,929 --> 01:16:50,367
Let's talk.

2197
01:16:50,368 --> 01:16:51,567
I tore it off.

2198
01:16:51,568 --> 01:16:53,298
(Tearing off)

2199
01:16:53,299 --> 01:16:56,008
(They eliminate her name tag successfully.)

2200
01:16:56,009 --> 01:16:57,308
Please.

2201
01:16:57,309 --> 01:16:58,907
(Seok Jin and So Min fail to complete their final mission.)

2202
01:16:58,908 --> 01:17:00,277
Please.

2203
01:17:00,278 --> 01:17:01,288
So Min.

2204
01:17:01,349 --> 01:17:02,478
Seok Jin.

2205
01:17:02,479 --> 01:17:03,878
(So Min's passionate romance is finally over.)

2206
01:17:03,879 --> 01:17:05,061
Come here, So Min.

2207
01:17:05,479 --> 01:17:06,718
How did you find me?

2208
01:17:06,719 --> 01:17:08,447
Let's continue, Seok Jin.

2209
01:17:08,448 --> 01:17:10,388
(I won't give up.)

2210
01:17:10,389 --> 01:17:11,588
It's over.

2211
01:17:11,589 --> 01:17:13,718
Once it's torn off, you aren't a couple.

2212
01:17:13,719 --> 01:17:14,928
- So Min. - It's our date.

2213
01:17:14,929 --> 01:17:17,728
You abandoned Yi Kyung and Ji Suk.

2214
01:17:17,729 --> 01:17:18,810
Let's take a photo.

2215
01:17:20,229 --> 01:17:21,968
Stop following us.

2216
01:17:21,969 --> 01:17:24,018
(Ji Suk begs for love persistently.)

2217
01:17:24,998 --> 01:17:26,468
(Love comes back.)

2218
01:17:26,469 --> 01:17:27,968
He wasn't included in the photo.

2219
01:17:27,969 --> 01:17:29,454
Let me see it.

2220
01:17:29,538 --> 01:17:30,892
Don't we look good together?

2221
01:17:31,509 --> 01:17:34,337
This was a special episode for So Min's birthday.

2222
01:17:34,479 --> 01:17:36,407
Abandon if your heart doesn't flutter.

2223
01:17:36,408 --> 01:17:38,678
The final winner of Sulliver's Love Race is...

2224
01:17:38,679 --> 01:17:40,777
Running Man and Team Chasers.

2225
01:17:40,778 --> 01:17:41,848
(Running Man and Team Chasers)

2226
01:17:41,849 --> 01:17:43,418
Two of you, come here.

2227
01:17:43,419 --> 01:17:44,630
This is amazing.

2228
01:17:45,089 --> 01:17:46,502
That was great.

2229
01:17:47,358 --> 01:17:49,853
Although they weren't chosen by So Min,

2230
01:17:49,929 --> 01:17:51,527
Ji Suk and Yi Kyung took an active part...

2231
01:17:51,528 --> 01:17:53,276
as chasers.

2232
01:17:53,729 --> 01:17:56,526
They win a diamond ring as a prize.

2233
01:17:56,969 --> 01:17:58,098
Are you giving them to us?

2234
01:17:58,099 --> 01:17:59,537
Is it a real diamond?

2235
01:17:59,538 --> 01:18:00,598
Thank you.

2236
01:18:00,599 --> 01:18:03,538
As So Min failed,

2237
01:18:03,669 --> 01:18:05,907
she'll pay the entire date expenses.

2238
01:18:05,908 --> 01:18:07,277
- Pardon? - She'll be penalized.

2239
01:18:07,278 --> 01:18:08,348
Me?

2240
01:18:08,349 --> 01:18:10,469
So Min looks upset now.

2241
01:18:11,919 --> 01:18:13,678
- When did I say that I'd eat? - Is this it?

2242
01:18:13,679 --> 01:18:14,729
(When did I say that I'd eat?)

2243
01:18:14,919 --> 01:18:16,987
- The meal cost 300 dollars? - Ask your agency to pay.

2244
01:18:16,988 --> 01:18:18,617
She has to be hit.

2245
01:18:18,618 --> 01:18:19,888
"Hit"?

2246
01:18:19,889 --> 01:18:21,707
We'll say, "Happy Birthday".

2247
01:18:21,759 --> 01:18:22,857
Okay.

2248
01:18:22,858 --> 01:18:24,798
- Happy Birthday. - Happy Birthday.

2249
01:18:24,799 --> 01:18:25,897
(Happy Birthday, So Min.)

2250
01:18:25,898 --> 01:18:27,567
(Birthday)

2251
01:18:27,568 --> 01:18:32,113
(Cake)

2252
01:18:33,639 --> 01:18:36,407
(They're surprised by what they've never seen before.)

2253
01:18:36,408 --> 01:18:39,064
(This is a real birthday cake.)

2254
01:18:39,778 --> 01:18:41,607
She turned into an alien.

2255
01:18:41,608 --> 01:18:42,607
(I'm Groot.)

2256
01:18:42,608 --> 01:18:44,224
Take selfies with her.

2257
01:18:44,479 --> 01:18:46,117
- It's a frenzy. - My goodness.

2258
01:18:46,118 --> 01:18:47,918
So Min is so popular.

2259
01:18:47,919 --> 01:18:49,088
Congratulations.

2260
01:18:49,089 --> 01:18:50,588
(We thank Kim Ji Suk, Lee Yi Kyung, and Ha Seok Jin.)

2261
01:18:50,589 --> 01:18:52,117
Happy Birthday, So Min.

2262
01:18:52,118 --> 01:18:53,402
(We thank Kim Ji Suk, Lee Yi Kyung, and Ha Seok Jin.)

2263
01:18:53,889 --> 01:18:56,454
(The 2019 war of the real-time trending keywords starts.)

2264
01:18:56,759 --> 01:18:58,897
(4 teams participate.)

2265
01:18:58,898 --> 01:19:01,268
(Running Man, Seventeen)

2266
01:19:01,269 --> 01:19:03,197
(Running Man, Kim Hye Yoon)

2267
01:19:03,198 --> 01:19:05,592
(Running Man, Han Bo Reum)

2268
01:19:06,469 --> 01:19:09,067
(They fight to be number 1 trending keyword.)

2269
01:19:09,068 --> 01:19:10,978

2270
01:19:10,979 --> 01:19:12,878
(they show off their personal talents.)

2271
01:19:12,879 --> 01:19:16,947
(Members go over the line to be searched online.)

2272
01:19:16,948 --> 01:19:19,548
(Is everything allowed to do just to be number 1?)

2273
01:19:19,549 --> 01:19:23,588
(A strange phenomenon that calls for obsession)

2274
01:19:23,589 --> 01:19:25,104
(And)

2275
01:19:25,589 --> 01:19:28,857
(A hint that can change the rank is inside the balloon?)

2276
01:19:28,858 --> 01:19:31,586
(A suffocating chase for trending keywords)

2277
01:19:31,658 --> 01:19:33,957
(Who will win the throne of the most trending keyword?)

2278
01:19:33,958 --> 01:19:35,968
(Search Running Man next week.)
