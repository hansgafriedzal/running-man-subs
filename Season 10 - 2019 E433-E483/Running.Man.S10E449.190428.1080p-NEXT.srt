00:00:05,594 --> 00:00:06,836
Hello.

2
00:00:06,854 --> 00:00:08,663
- Hello. - Hi.

3
00:00:08,664 --> 00:00:09,836
Good morning.

4
00:00:09,994 --> 00:00:11,594
Hello. Hi, Mi Yeon.

5
00:00:11,595 --> 00:00:14,764
Jong Kook had a solo concert after nine years.

6
00:00:14,765 --> 00:00:16,351
- That's right. - Amazing!

7
00:00:16,534 --> 00:00:18,434
- His life is getting better. - Congratulations.

8
00:00:18,435 --> 00:00:21,333
I had a concert after a nine-year hiatus.

9
00:00:21,334 --> 00:00:22,473
- Right. - That's right.

10
00:00:22,474 --> 00:00:24,243
- Kwang Soo came. - Don't mention it.

11
00:00:24,244 --> 00:00:25,743
- And So Min came too. - My gosh.

12
00:00:25,744 --> 00:00:28,644
- Se Chan did a performance. - Right.

13
00:00:28,645 --> 00:00:30,401
- He performed on stage. - I see.

14
00:00:31,244 --> 00:00:33,354
And you came too, Jae Seok.

15
00:00:33,355 --> 00:00:35,554
- Of course. It was your concert. - Thank you.

16
00:00:35,555 --> 00:00:37,124
- It was on your social media. - I...

17
00:00:37,125 --> 00:00:38,693
- He came to my concert. - You were on social media.

18
00:00:38,694 --> 00:00:40,854
He came three hours before the concert.

19
00:00:40,855 --> 00:00:42,763
(I'm grateful that you came, but you came 3 hours before.)

20
00:00:42,764 --> 00:00:45,123
- He came early. - Why did you make it uncomfortable?

21
00:00:45,124 --> 00:00:46,833
- It wasn't. It was really nice. - Really?

22
00:00:46,834 --> 00:00:48,964
I went to the concert and talked to Jong Kook.

23
00:00:48,965 --> 00:00:50,903
I asked him if I could make a guest appearance.

24
00:00:50,904 --> 00:00:52,534
- You asked him that. - Jong Kook quietly said,

25
00:00:52,535 --> 00:00:54,928
"No".

26
00:00:55,303 --> 00:00:56,943
I told him he didn't have to, but he kept forcing it.

27
00:00:56,944 --> 00:00:58,443
- So was he in the concert? - I told him I could be the guest.

28
00:00:58,444 --> 00:01:00,443
- He wasn't supposed to be in it. - I see.

29
00:01:00,444 --> 00:01:01,744
But in the end,

30
00:01:01,745 --> 00:01:04,744
he was dancing by himself, and people found out.

31
00:01:04,745 --> 00:01:06,300
He laughed while singing because of me.

32
00:01:07,053 --> 00:01:09,854
(When Jong Kook was singing the high notes on stage...)

33
00:01:09,855 --> 00:01:12,054
(What?)

34
00:01:12,055 --> 00:01:15,800
(I'm the Mr. Yu the Excitement.)

35
00:01:16,094 --> 00:01:19,196
- He was jumping around. - I couldn't stop myself.

36
00:01:19,335 --> 00:01:20,507
It was Jong Kook's song.

37
00:01:20,995 --> 00:01:22,804
I heard that So Min brought her mother.

38
00:01:22,805 --> 00:01:24,533
- She brought her parents. - My parents came too.

39
00:01:24,534 --> 00:01:25,574
- Her parents came too. - My gosh.

40
00:01:25,575 --> 00:01:27,322
- My parents are his fans. - Did your mom see him?

41
00:01:27,373 --> 00:01:29,574
Her mother was very beautiful. I was really surprised.

42
00:01:29,575 --> 00:01:32,705
- After her mother saw him perform, - Thank you.

43
00:01:32,745 --> 00:01:35,442
she subtly mentioned that he could be her son-in-law.

44
00:01:35,915 --> 00:01:38,584
She said that, but the age gap is too big.

45
00:01:38,585 --> 00:01:39,953
(The age got in the way.)

46
00:01:39,954 --> 00:01:41,652
- I'm older than her. - Right.

47
00:01:41,653 --> 00:01:44,384
But I still left an impression on So Min's mother...

48
00:01:44,385 --> 00:01:45,453
- Exactly. - for now.

49
00:01:45,454 --> 00:01:46,854
By the way, Jong Kook is...

50
00:01:46,855 --> 00:01:49,292
leaving a lot of comments on So Min's social media nowadays.

51
00:01:49,293 --> 00:01:50,923
I'm really happy that they are writing...

52
00:01:50,924 --> 00:01:52,563
- comments on my posts. - I couldn't just help myself.

53
00:01:52,564 --> 00:01:55,762
- You couldn't skip them. - Right. All of her writing...

54
00:01:55,763 --> 00:01:57,987
Jong Kook especially doesn't like that kind of posts.

55
00:01:58,305 --> 00:02:00,533
Jong Kook can't stand posts like hers.

56
00:02:00,534 --> 00:02:02,042
It calls for my comments.

57
00:02:02,043 --> 00:02:04,503
- So Min writes that kind of posts. - That's true.

58
00:02:04,504 --> 00:02:05,843
It's a space for my creativity.

59
00:02:05,844 --> 00:02:07,813
What did you write? What was that?

60
00:02:07,814 --> 00:02:10,914
"When I'm someone's world, spring comes."

61
00:02:10,915 --> 00:02:12,772
- Did you write that? - Isn't that cool? Yes, I did.

62
00:02:12,954 --> 00:02:15,924
(It's indecipherable. What does this mean?)

63
00:02:15,925 --> 00:02:18,383
- What does it mean? She means you. - Here's the author's intention.

64
00:02:18,384 --> 00:02:20,592
- Who's the author? Is that you? - Me. My intention was...

65
00:02:20,593 --> 00:02:22,823
- When someone finds you special... - Real spring doesn't come...

66
00:02:22,824 --> 00:02:24,692
because seasons change.

67
00:02:24,693 --> 00:02:27,434
When I'm in love, and I become someone's world,

68
00:02:27,435 --> 00:02:30,234
that's the truest form of spring. That's what I meant.

69
00:02:30,235 --> 00:02:31,245
(The world becomes spring.)

70
00:02:32,074 --> 00:02:33,921
- Isn't this cool? - On this post,

71
00:02:34,033 --> 00:02:35,744
- kjk76 wrote, - Okay.

72
00:02:35,745 --> 00:02:36,902
"What does this mean?"

73
00:02:36,903 --> 00:02:39,872
(Kjk76: What does this mean?)

74
00:02:40,914 --> 00:02:43,214
Jong Kook. Jong Kook!

75
00:02:43,215 --> 00:02:44,544
"What does this mean?"

76
00:02:44,545 --> 00:02:47,752
I don't know who this is. I don't know who wrote this.

77
00:02:47,753 --> 00:02:49,554
- He must've been born in 1976. - Kjk76...

78
00:02:49,555 --> 00:02:51,924
wrote, "What does this mean?"

79
00:02:51,925 --> 00:02:52,954
"What does this mean?"

80
00:02:52,955 --> 00:02:55,054
And So Min said, "You came into my frame."

81
00:02:55,055 --> 00:02:57,489
Kjk76 wrote,

82
00:02:57,693 --> 00:02:59,452
"My gosh..."

83
00:03:00,193 --> 00:03:01,834
(He ruins it for the 2nd time.)

84
00:03:01,835 --> 00:03:03,633
- Did he use that tone? - Yes.

85
00:03:03,634 --> 00:03:05,002
- Yes. - That's how he wrote?

86
00:03:05,003 --> 00:03:07,032
- You can pick up on it right away. - It's written there.

87
00:03:07,033 --> 00:03:08,032
Writing a comment must have been a hassle.

88
00:03:08,033 --> 00:03:10,144
- That's what happened. - "My gosh..."

89
00:03:10,145 --> 00:03:12,472
Seriously. He must have hated that.

90
00:03:12,473 --> 00:03:13,472
Those sentimental writings.

91
00:03:13,473 --> 00:03:16,342
By the way, kjk76...

92
00:03:16,343 --> 00:03:17,913
- and So Min... - They have good chemistry.

93
00:03:17,914 --> 00:03:20,014
have great chemistry on social media.

94
00:03:20,015 --> 00:03:22,306
- They started it not long ago. - Right.

95
00:03:22,425 --> 00:03:23,823
- It hasn't been long. - It's pretty new.

96
00:03:23,824 --> 00:03:25,554
- Exactly. It's only been a month. - That's true.

97
00:03:25,555 --> 00:03:27,372
You guys became good friends quickly.

98
00:03:29,123 --> 00:03:30,424
(The atmosphere feels friendly.)

99
00:03:30,425 --> 00:03:32,584
Everyone seems to be getting along very well,

100
00:03:33,063 --> 00:03:35,133
but there are two guests...

101
00:03:35,134 --> 00:03:36,603
- Really? - who came to visit you today.

102
00:03:36,604 --> 00:03:38,633
- We have guests today? - Let me bring them in.

103
00:03:38,634 --> 00:03:39,804
Come on out.

104
00:03:39,805 --> 00:03:40,845
(We'll introduce these two guests.)

105
00:03:41,533 --> 00:03:42,544
- Who is that? - My gosh!

106
00:03:42,545 --> 00:03:43,902
(The guests are visiting Running Man.)

107
00:03:43,903 --> 00:03:46,573
(Who are these two guests?)

108
00:03:46,574 --> 00:03:47,573
(The pair that will bring a mega-hit to the theaters)

109
00:03:47,574 --> 00:03:50,140
- My gosh, hello. - Goodness.

110
00:03:50,245 --> 00:03:51,244
My gosh.

111
00:03:51,245 --> 00:03:53,477
Let me introduce you to Kim Kyung Nam and Esom.

112
00:03:54,753 --> 00:03:57,252
(She used to be a unique top model and made a debut as an actress.)

113
00:03:57,253 --> 00:04:00,325
(Esom, a popular actress who's always getting offers)

114
00:04:00,693 --> 00:04:03,592
(From a scene-stealer who used to be on people's mind,)

115
00:04:03,593 --> 00:04:07,504
(Kyung Nam became an amazing and popular actor now.)

116
00:04:07,693 --> 00:04:09,964
- Hello. Esom. - Hi.

117
00:04:09,965 --> 00:04:11,633
- Hi. - Hello.

118
00:04:11,634 --> 00:04:14,804
- That's right. - He was in that prison drama.

119
00:04:14,805 --> 00:04:16,372
- Really? - It's Kyung Nam.

120
00:04:16,373 --> 00:04:17,858
Move back!

121
00:04:18,343 --> 00:04:19,544
- Come to the center. - Hello.

122
00:04:19,545 --> 00:04:20,942
- Hello. - Nice to meet you.

123
00:04:20,943 --> 00:04:22,184
- All right. - Welcome.

124
00:04:22,185 --> 00:04:23,659
- Stop lying. - Seriously.

125
00:04:24,485 --> 00:04:27,282
Could you introduce yourselves to the viewers?

126
00:04:27,485 --> 00:04:28,823
- Okay. - Introduction.

127
00:04:28,824 --> 00:04:29,924
All right. I am...

128
00:04:29,925 --> 00:04:31,743
- He sounded really cold, right? - What do you mean?

129
00:04:31,754 --> 00:04:34,123
He said he was happy to see them, but he said, "Introduction".

130
00:04:34,124 --> 00:04:35,165
(Introduction)

131
00:04:35,355 --> 00:04:36,962
- He's unbelievable. - I just blurted it out.

132
00:04:36,963 --> 00:04:38,682
I told him to introduce himself.

133
00:04:40,764 --> 00:04:43,304
(He pretended to be happy to see him like a gentleman.)

134
00:04:43,305 --> 00:04:44,951
(He suddenly changes.)

135
00:04:45,704 --> 00:04:48,203
He has multiple personalities. He has a few personalities.

136
00:04:48,204 --> 00:04:49,844
- No, that's not true. - He has multiple personalities.

137
00:04:49,845 --> 00:04:51,143
- No, I'm a warmhearted person. - Go ahead.

138
00:04:51,144 --> 00:04:53,033
- No way. - He's acting territorial.

139
00:04:53,144 --> 00:04:55,844
Could you introduce yourselves?

140
00:04:55,845 --> 00:04:58,067
Okay, I'm Esom.

141
00:04:58,384 --> 00:04:59,383
She's pretty.

142
00:04:59,384 --> 00:05:01,354
- Wasn't she a model? - She was a model.

143
00:05:01,355 --> 00:05:03,753
- She looks like a model, right? - Yes. She does have that vibe.

144
00:05:03,754 --> 00:05:05,823
- Right. - This comedian used to be a model.

145
00:05:05,824 --> 00:05:07,773
- Kwang Soo... - Right.

146
00:05:07,954 --> 00:05:09,594
Comedian who used to be a model?

147
00:05:09,595 --> 00:05:11,364
- Listen. - I can't believe this.

148
00:05:11,365 --> 00:05:13,763
Did he film a movie with you?

149
00:05:13,764 --> 00:05:15,164
- Yes. - The three of us filmed it.

150
00:05:15,165 --> 00:05:16,882
- The three of you? - I see.

151
00:05:17,064 --> 00:05:18,133
- With Shin Ha Kyun? - Yes.

152
00:05:18,134 --> 00:05:19,891
Yes, that movie. It looked fun.

153
00:05:19,935 --> 00:05:22,404
What kind of guy is Kwang Soo?

154
00:05:22,405 --> 00:05:24,003
You filmed the movie with him.

155
00:05:24,004 --> 00:05:26,844
Kwang Soo? He's...

156
00:05:26,845 --> 00:05:28,943
- very serious at the shoot. - I knew it.

157
00:05:28,944 --> 00:05:30,943
- People are talking about you. - What do they say?

158
00:05:30,944 --> 00:05:32,903
Word on the street is that you're different from Running Man.

159
00:05:33,584 --> 00:05:36,022
I can't act all crazy over there.

160
00:05:36,023 --> 00:05:38,424
(I'm at a movie shoot.)

161
00:05:38,425 --> 00:05:39,424
You should though.

162
00:05:39,425 --> 00:05:40,953
I would be arrested then.

163
00:05:40,954 --> 00:05:42,054
Come on, Kwang Soo.

164
00:05:42,055 --> 00:05:44,664
You, you. You've become an entitled leading actor.

165
00:05:44,665 --> 00:05:45,934
(He finishes his diagnosis.)

166
00:05:45,935 --> 00:05:47,164
- That's not true. - No.

167
00:05:47,165 --> 00:05:50,366
- That's not it. - You're full of yourself!

168
00:05:50,535 --> 00:05:53,003
What are you saying? That's not true.

169
00:05:53,004 --> 00:05:54,823
Is that true? Is that true, Kwang Soo?

170
00:05:55,235 --> 00:05:56,844
(Please look forward to Kwang Soo's secrets from Esom.)

171
00:05:56,845 --> 00:05:58,086
That was new.

172
00:05:58,305 --> 00:05:59,813
- Kwang Soo is different. - Seriously.

173
00:05:59,814 --> 00:06:02,946
We've heard from Esom. Now, we'll hear from Kyung Nam.

174
00:06:03,415 --> 00:06:05,001
- He's tanned. - Okay.

175
00:06:05,345 --> 00:06:08,747
- Hello, I'm actor Kim Kyung Nam. - Great.

176
00:06:08,814 --> 00:06:11,253
- Kyung Nam. - I'm a huge fan.

177
00:06:11,254 --> 00:06:13,753
- Really? - I liked you in the prison drama.

178
00:06:13,754 --> 00:06:15,573
- He looks like a model. - Okay.

179
00:06:15,963 --> 00:06:18,294
Wait. Do you freeze around famous people?

180
00:06:18,295 --> 00:06:20,152
- Yes... I do. - Is that so?

181
00:06:20,165 --> 00:06:22,486
Then, you must feel a bit awkward today.

182
00:06:23,204 --> 00:06:24,234
Right.

183
00:06:24,235 --> 00:06:26,053
(Suddenly interrupting)

184
00:06:26,175 --> 00:06:28,104
(You must feel shy around this famous guy, Seok Jin.)

185
00:06:28,105 --> 00:06:30,203
- Why would you say that? - He's unbelievably territorial.

186
00:06:30,204 --> 00:06:31,674
- Are you feeling shy now? - This is driving me crazy.

187
00:06:31,675 --> 00:06:34,674
- Seriously. He's not that famous. - Today...

188
00:06:34,675 --> 00:06:36,383
He's too much.

189
00:06:36,384 --> 00:06:38,212
- It's okay. You'll get used to me. - Okay.

190
00:06:38,213 --> 00:06:40,453
- He's not that famous? - His popularity is very low.

191
00:06:40,454 --> 00:06:42,374
He acts all arrogant.

192
00:06:42,655 --> 00:06:46,022
All right. How was Kwang Soo's first impression?

193
00:06:46,023 --> 00:06:49,296
(This is the first official question.)

194
00:06:51,365 --> 00:06:54,864
(If you ask me a question like that out of the blue,)

195
00:06:54,865 --> 00:06:57,404
(how could I answer that...)

196
00:06:57,405 --> 00:07:00,304
(in front of all these famous people?)

197
00:07:00,305 --> 00:07:02,104
(Having butterflies)

198
00:07:02,105 --> 00:07:06,013
(His mental sanity has gone to the Andromeda Galaxy.)

199
00:07:06,014 --> 00:07:07,414
Who said I was annoying?

200
00:07:07,415 --> 00:07:09,414
(Here comes his savior.)

201
00:07:09,415 --> 00:07:10,544
Annoying?

202
00:07:10,545 --> 00:07:11,943
Annoying?

203
00:07:11,944 --> 00:07:13,974
I think I heard someone saying "annoying".

204
00:07:14,355 --> 00:07:15,484
Did I hear it wrong?

205
00:07:15,485 --> 00:07:17,154
I don't know how it is, but it's accurate.

206
00:07:17,155 --> 00:07:18,801
- Annoying. - Okay.

207
00:07:18,954 --> 00:07:22,664
All right. I will ask you the next question.

208
00:07:22,665 --> 00:07:24,664
- You haven't answered anything. - Okay.

209
00:07:24,665 --> 00:07:26,078
(Getting ready to blurt out mean comments)

210
00:07:26,134 --> 00:07:27,434
- He didn't answer anything. - You must answer.

211
00:07:27,435 --> 00:07:28,934
- 0. You have 0 points. - Right.

212
00:07:28,935 --> 00:07:30,364
- We'll ask and answer. - He didn't answer.

213
00:07:30,365 --> 00:07:31,804
All right. Pay attention.

214
00:07:31,805 --> 00:07:33,474
- Pay attention. - He hasn't answered anything.

215
00:07:33,475 --> 00:07:34,990
- You can do it. - You can do it.

216
00:07:35,273 --> 00:07:37,426
- You can do it. - You're doing great!

217
00:07:37,845 --> 00:07:41,611
I heard that you're well-versed in acrostic poems.

218
00:07:43,084 --> 00:07:44,544
- Acrostic poems. This will work. - Right.

219
00:07:44,545 --> 00:07:46,029
- The best part of variety shows. - Let's do this!

220
00:07:46,115 --> 00:07:47,554
You must do this one.

221
00:07:47,555 --> 00:07:50,753
All right. Let's go with "Running Man".

222
00:07:50,754 --> 00:07:52,022
- You can do it! - Could you do one?

223
00:07:52,023 --> 00:07:53,237
- You can do it. - That's a hard one.

224
00:07:53,254 --> 00:07:54,924
- Go for it. - You can do it.

225
00:07:54,925 --> 00:07:56,580
You can do this. You got this!

226
00:07:56,795 --> 00:07:57,936
Let's do this one!

227
00:07:58,495 --> 00:07:59,677
First syllable.

228
00:08:00,365 --> 00:08:01,607
I was on a treadmill.

229
00:08:01,665 --> 00:08:02,976
- That was great. - Good, good.

230
00:08:03,735 --> 00:08:04,934
Second syllable.

231
00:08:04,935 --> 00:08:06,085
I got an IV.

232
00:08:06,735 --> 00:08:07,873
Third syllable.

233
00:08:07,874 --> 00:08:10,143
(Will he be able to finish it smoothly?)

234
00:08:10,144 --> 00:08:11,215
On my bare skin.

235
00:08:12,814 --> 00:08:14,674
(Kyung Nam is so eloquent!)

236
00:08:14,675 --> 00:08:16,098
- That was entertaining. - Great, great.

237
00:08:16,115 --> 00:08:18,004
- You get it on your bare skin. - That was fun.

238
00:08:18,785 --> 00:08:20,269
- That was original. - Right.

239
00:08:20,355 --> 00:08:22,823
Great, great. That was great.

240
00:08:22,824 --> 00:08:24,453
Can you do one with Kwang Soo's name?

241
00:08:24,454 --> 00:08:26,272
(Let's try this too since we're at it.)

242
00:08:26,495 --> 00:08:28,342
- Lee Kwang Soo. - You can do it!

243
00:08:28,425 --> 00:08:30,623
- Okay. - You can do this.

244
00:08:30,624 --> 00:08:31,893
(Let's finish it off with the momentum.)

245
00:08:31,894 --> 00:08:33,076
First syllable.

246
00:08:33,894 --> 00:08:35,006
As you can see...

247
00:08:36,405 --> 00:08:37,678
- "As you can see". - Second syllable.

248
00:08:38,935 --> 00:08:40,288
We're in this crazy atmosphere.

249
00:08:40,305 --> 00:08:41,404
(He's finally got the hang of it.)

250
00:08:41,405 --> 00:08:42,688
It's going great.

251
00:08:44,045 --> 00:08:45,102
Third syllable.

252
00:08:45,103 --> 00:08:48,443
(If he comes up with the last one, it will be a big hit.)

253
00:08:48,444 --> 00:08:53,402
(Will he be able to adjust to the show with the acrostic poem?)

254
00:08:55,685 --> 00:09:00,254
(His mental sanity goes to the Andromeda Galaxy again.)

255
00:09:00,255 --> 00:09:01,554
- You can do it! - You can do it!

256
00:09:01,555 --> 00:09:03,079
- You're almost there! - You can do it!

257
00:09:03,194 --> 00:09:05,664
(Wait. It's a time-out on a variety show.)

258
00:09:05,665 --> 00:09:07,492
(We must get him adjusted to the variety show now.)

259
00:09:07,493 --> 00:09:08,664
Pay attention.

260
00:09:08,665 --> 00:09:09,875
We'll break for a commercial now.

261
00:09:10,233 --> 00:09:11,345
Look forward to it.

262
00:09:11,733 --> 00:09:13,374
- You can do the last one. - You can do it.

263
00:09:13,375 --> 00:09:15,193
- You can do it! - Continue.

264
00:09:15,635 --> 00:09:16,774
Third syllable.

265
00:09:16,775 --> 00:09:18,073
(It's the last syllable in Kwang Soo's name.)

266
00:09:18,074 --> 00:09:19,174
You can do it!

267
00:09:19,175 --> 00:09:20,874
(Will he be able to succeed?)

268
00:09:20,875 --> 00:09:22,684
(What's the result of his training?)

269
00:09:22,685 --> 00:09:23,842
Why don't we have a drink?

270
00:09:23,843 --> 00:09:25,044
(Why don't we have a drink?)

271
00:09:25,045 --> 00:09:27,784
(He successfully saves his acrostic poem.)

272
00:09:27,785 --> 00:09:30,054
- That was a basic move. - Basic move?

273
00:09:30,055 --> 00:09:31,284
Get rid of your shyness!

274
00:09:31,285 --> 00:09:32,654
You're almost there! Go for it!

275
00:09:32,655 --> 00:09:34,140
(Good luck until you overcome your shyness.)

276
00:09:34,155 --> 00:09:35,453
Shouldn't you make a pledge in case...

277
00:09:35,454 --> 00:09:36,764
- you sell five million tickets? - Make a pledge.

278
00:09:36,765 --> 00:09:38,563
- They must do it for 5 million. - 5 million tickets.

279
00:09:38,564 --> 00:09:39,862
Why don't you make a pledge?

280
00:09:39,863 --> 00:09:41,378
- 5 million tickets deserve it. - 5 million tickets.

281
00:09:41,463 --> 00:09:43,563
Why don't you come back to the show with Ha Kyun if that happens?

282
00:09:43,564 --> 00:09:44,703
- Yes. I'd like that. - Is that okay?

283
00:09:44,704 --> 00:09:46,232
(Count me in!)

284
00:09:46,233 --> 00:09:47,904
- That's good, right? Great. - Of course.

285
00:09:47,905 --> 00:09:49,443
(Sell 5 million tickets and see you on Running Man, Ha Kyun.)

286
00:09:49,444 --> 00:09:51,004
Great. When you sell five million tickets...

287
00:09:51,005 --> 00:09:52,342
Hey, we answered everything today.

288
00:09:52,343 --> 00:09:53,757
They didn't answer anything.

289
00:09:54,545 --> 00:09:56,403
- You made the pledge for them. - We had our answers in mind.

290
00:09:56,545 --> 00:09:59,014
We ask questions and answer them too.

291
00:09:59,015 --> 00:10:00,225
We had our answers in mind.

292
00:10:00,285 --> 00:10:02,352
- We asked and answered. - We had our answers in mind.

293
00:10:02,353 --> 00:10:03,352
Everyone.

294
00:10:03,353 --> 00:10:05,124
We asked you to come here...

295
00:10:05,125 --> 00:10:07,254
- early in the morning for a reason. - What is it?

296
00:10:07,255 --> 00:10:10,124
- We have invitations for you. - Invitations?

297
00:10:10,125 --> 00:10:12,063
(We have invitations for you.)

298
00:10:12,064 --> 00:10:13,232
- Invitations? - Invitations?

299
00:10:13,233 --> 00:10:15,134
(These mysterious invitations were sent to the members.)

300
00:10:15,135 --> 00:10:17,004
- My gosh. - Do we just choose one?

301
00:10:17,005 --> 00:10:18,520
- Yes. - I guess we'll randomly draw one.

302
00:10:18,665 --> 00:10:20,754
- Are these randomly chosen? - We can share them together, right?

303
00:10:21,275 --> 00:10:22,416
Let's look.

304
00:10:22,473 --> 00:10:25,274
"I welcome you to the world where you can earn millions."

305
00:10:25,275 --> 00:10:26,274
"Host S".

306
00:10:26,275 --> 00:10:27,313
Who is Host S?

307
00:10:27,314 --> 00:10:31,020
(And a mysterious host sent them the invitations.)

308
00:10:31,915 --> 00:10:34,914
You'll go to a place where Host S invited you to go.

309
00:10:34,915 --> 00:10:36,722
- Let's go. - And you'll start the race there.

310
00:10:36,723 --> 00:10:38,083
- Let's go. - Let's go.

311
00:10:38,084 --> 00:10:41,891
(What is the secret that awaits the members?)

312
00:10:43,064 --> 00:10:44,722
- Can we go in now? - Shall we go in?

313
00:10:44,723 --> 00:10:45,823
(The members arrive at the place Host S invited them to.)

314
00:10:45,824 --> 00:10:48,664
- Gosh, it's big. Why is it so big? - We're starting.

315
00:10:48,665 --> 00:10:51,962
(How will the world where they can make millions at look?)

316
00:10:51,963 --> 00:10:54,761
- We're starting. - What is this?

317
00:10:54,805 --> 00:10:56,904
- There are boxes. - It's huge.

318
00:10:56,905 --> 00:10:58,573
- There's a lot here. - Those are box containers.

319
00:10:58,574 --> 00:11:00,813
(The world of making millions is full of...)

320
00:11:00,814 --> 00:11:02,544
(10 box containers.)

321
00:11:02,545 --> 00:11:04,083
You said we'd get a fortune. What is this?

322
00:11:04,084 --> 00:11:05,384
This place is huge.

323
00:11:05,385 --> 00:11:06,654
There are boxes.

324
00:11:06,655 --> 00:11:09,311
(Something seems off. What is this place?)

325
00:11:09,353 --> 00:11:10,839
- Why is there 100,000 dollars? - Is that 100,000 dollars?

326
00:11:11,155 --> 00:11:12,453
- What? - The cash prize is 100,000 dollars?

327
00:11:12,454 --> 00:11:13,808
- What? - Yes, it is.

328
00:11:13,993 --> 00:11:15,092
(The box containers unfold before their eyes.)

329
00:11:15,093 --> 00:11:16,794
- It's 100,000 dollars. - It really is.

330
00:11:16,795 --> 00:11:18,424
My gosh. They'll give us 100,000 dollars?

331
00:11:18,425 --> 00:11:20,193
- We'll get 100,000 dollars? - 100,000 dollars?

332
00:11:20,194 --> 00:11:21,294
Really?

333
00:11:21,295 --> 00:11:22,394
This is amazing.

334
00:11:22,395 --> 00:11:23,848
I'll tell you the rules now.

335
00:11:23,905 --> 00:11:26,227
Today's cash prize is 100,000 dollars.

336
00:11:26,675 --> 00:11:29,331
For nine hours, depending on how much money you save,

337
00:11:29,405 --> 00:11:32,172
you can divide the leftover money with the members.

338
00:11:32,305 --> 00:11:34,274
It's called Inseparable Money Race.

339
00:11:34,275 --> 00:11:35,573
(Inseparable Money Race)

340
00:11:35,574 --> 00:11:36,856
- Depending on how much we save? - We'll split it among us?

341
00:11:37,314 --> 00:11:40,344
In other words, if you don't use a penny for nine hours,

342
00:11:40,454 --> 00:11:42,254
everyone will get 10,000 dollars at the end.

343
00:11:42,255 --> 00:11:44,583
(If they don't spend any money, everyone will get 10,000 dollars.)

344
00:11:44,584 --> 00:11:46,524
- 10,000 dollars per person? - We're diving the money.

345
00:11:46,525 --> 00:11:48,852
For the duration of the race, you cannot use...

346
00:11:48,853 --> 00:11:50,924
- any of your personal belongings. - Nothing?

347
00:11:50,925 --> 00:11:51,992
Not even our phone?

348
00:11:51,993 --> 00:11:55,232
You must buy whatever you need.

349
00:11:55,233 --> 00:11:56,764
- This is terrible. - To buy them,

350
00:11:56,765 --> 00:11:59,563
you must use the intercom inside the box containers.

351
00:11:59,675 --> 00:12:02,274
And the value of the money here will be different from our world.

352
00:12:02,275 --> 00:12:04,044
- Of course. I knew it. - Come on.

353
00:12:04,045 --> 00:12:05,073
- I see. - That's right.

354
00:12:05,074 --> 00:12:07,112
- I bet everything is expensive. - That's right.

355
00:12:07,113 --> 00:12:08,792
What if...

356
00:12:09,175 --> 00:12:11,514
you charge us 20,000 dollars for 1 bowl of cup noodles?

357
00:12:11,515 --> 00:12:13,054
- Exactly. Or 5,000 dollars. - A long time ago,

358
00:12:13,055 --> 00:12:14,813
- how much was a pair of chopsticks? - Right.

359
00:12:14,814 --> 00:12:16,384
- 5,000 dollars. - It was like 500 dollars.

360
00:12:16,385 --> 00:12:19,894
You can only stay in this place for nine hours.

361
00:12:19,895 --> 00:12:20,894
- We can't do anything? - We can't get out?

362
00:12:20,895 --> 00:12:22,664
After spending an hour in the solitary container,

363
00:12:22,665 --> 00:12:25,394
the door will stay open for 30 minutes, and you can come out.

364
00:12:25,395 --> 00:12:26,492
Is that our recess?

365
00:12:26,493 --> 00:12:27,732
- Recess? - We're totally in prison.

366
00:12:27,733 --> 00:12:29,362
- It's like "Prison Playbook". - We're in prison.

367
00:12:29,363 --> 00:12:31,052
And the amount of your expenses...

368
00:12:31,103 --> 00:12:33,004
- will not be disclosed. - My gosh.

369
00:12:33,005 --> 00:12:35,731
(The amounts of individual expenses will not be disclosed.)

370
00:12:36,204 --> 00:12:37,242
- Hey. - It will be confidential.

371
00:12:37,243 --> 00:12:38,404
Hey, hey.

372
00:12:38,405 --> 00:12:41,203
My gosh, this is a special episode for Kwang Soo.

373
00:12:41,275 --> 00:12:42,573
- Unbelievable. - Everyone.

374
00:12:42,574 --> 00:12:44,544
- Kwang Soo. So Min. - We're doomed.

375
00:12:44,545 --> 00:12:45,784
- Gosh, no. - No, no.

376
00:12:45,785 --> 00:12:47,154
They'll go crazy with this.

377
00:12:47,155 --> 00:12:48,296
I can hold out for nine hours.

378
00:12:48,314 --> 00:12:51,982
All right. Please empty your pockets...

379
00:12:51,983 --> 00:12:53,609
- and give them to us. - I'll collect them.

380
00:12:53,625 --> 00:12:54,794
- Kwang Soo. - Okay.

381
00:12:54,795 --> 00:12:55,823
I can keep my lip balm, right?

382
00:12:55,824 --> 00:12:56,992
No, no. You have to buy that too.

383
00:12:56,993 --> 00:12:58,323
- I can't even keep that? - Of course, not.

384
00:12:58,324 --> 00:12:59,563
You can't have anything including the lip balm.

385
00:12:59,564 --> 00:13:01,934
- Nothing is allowed. - Give it to me.

386
00:13:01,935 --> 00:13:03,016
Esom.

387
00:13:03,265 --> 00:13:04,634
- What? - What is that?

388
00:13:04,635 --> 00:13:06,073
- What is this, Esom? - She has a comb.

389
00:13:06,074 --> 00:13:07,972
- Why do you use that kind of combs? - This is cute.

390
00:13:07,973 --> 00:13:09,544
(The popular actress has a comb.)

391
00:13:09,545 --> 00:13:11,073
- Let me comb my hair one last time. - Okay.

392
00:13:11,074 --> 00:13:12,242
(Rushing)

393
00:13:12,243 --> 00:13:13,414
That's for her hair.

394
00:13:13,415 --> 00:13:15,014
(Her smooth hair completes her beauty.)

395
00:13:15,015 --> 00:13:16,384
She and I have a similar hairstyle.

396
00:13:16,385 --> 00:13:18,044
- I want to go, but... - This is it.

397
00:13:18,045 --> 00:13:19,366
In the back,

398
00:13:19,454 --> 00:13:21,982
- there are containers from 1 to 10. - Okay.

399
00:13:21,983 --> 00:13:24,813
You can choose whichever container you want...

400
00:13:24,983 --> 00:13:26,394
and enter the containers one at a time.

401
00:13:26,395 --> 00:13:28,173
- Kwang Soo. You're on the far end. - Okay.

402
00:13:29,324 --> 00:13:30,394
Okay.

403
00:13:30,395 --> 00:13:31,722
I'll go with the fifth one.

404
00:13:31,723 --> 00:13:33,092
- You can't choose that one. - Why not?

405
00:13:33,093 --> 00:13:34,164
It's reserved.

406
00:13:34,165 --> 00:13:36,362
(It's already reserved for someone else.)

407
00:13:36,363 --> 00:13:37,434
It's a reservation basis?

408
00:13:37,435 --> 00:13:38,732
(He's flustered.)

409
00:13:38,733 --> 00:13:41,602
- It's already booked. - What?

410
00:13:41,603 --> 00:13:44,170
- It's already booked. - I thought I could pick anything.

411
00:13:44,275 --> 00:13:45,674
- Room Five is reserved. - Okay.

412
00:13:45,675 --> 00:13:48,014
Then, I'll go with the container on the far right, Room One.

413
00:13:48,015 --> 00:13:50,134
That one? It's already booked too.

414
00:13:50,843 --> 00:13:52,014
Then which ones are available?

415
00:13:52,015 --> 00:13:54,083
The remaining one is Room Four.

416
00:13:54,084 --> 00:13:55,083
(You'll go to Room 4.)

417
00:13:55,084 --> 00:13:56,903
- Four means death. - It means death.

418
00:13:57,255 --> 00:13:58,699
- Use another room then. - Room Four?

419
00:13:59,055 --> 00:14:00,794
- Sure, I'll go with that one. - Great.

420
00:14:00,795 --> 00:14:01,805
- Great. - Room Four.

421
00:14:01,853 --> 00:14:03,092
Next up is Seok Jin.

422
00:14:03,093 --> 00:14:04,124
I'll go with Room Five.

423
00:14:04,125 --> 00:14:05,362
It's reserved. I booked it.

424
00:14:05,363 --> 00:14:06,764
- Sure. Take Room Five. - Okay.

425
00:14:06,765 --> 00:14:08,563
(Seok Jin goes into Room 5.)

426
00:14:08,564 --> 00:14:10,203
(All 10 of them have gone into their rooms.)

427
00:14:10,204 --> 00:14:11,243
I'm going in.

428
00:14:12,265 --> 00:14:15,505
(The Inseparable Money Race starts.)

429
00:14:15,675 --> 00:14:17,724
What is this? There's nothing inside?

430
00:14:18,905 --> 00:14:21,443
(In the rooms that the members went into,)

431
00:14:21,444 --> 00:14:23,742
(there is nothing inside.)

432
00:14:23,743 --> 00:14:26,612
(The intercom system is the only thing in the room.)

433
00:14:26,785 --> 00:14:28,554
This is the intercom system we can order stuff from.

434
00:14:28,555 --> 00:14:30,482
(They can buy whatever they need,)

435
00:14:30,483 --> 00:14:32,474
(but the prices will be different from the real world.)

436
00:14:32,525 --> 00:14:33,909
Nothing is inside.

437
00:14:34,395 --> 00:14:35,970
There's nothing here.

438
00:14:36,564 --> 00:14:37,693
This really is like a prison cell.

439
00:14:37,694 --> 00:14:39,992
(They must survive in this room for 9 hours with the bare minimum.)

440
00:14:39,993 --> 00:14:43,264
Let me put on the uniform.

441
00:14:43,265 --> 00:14:45,434
(They'll divide the leftover money equally among themselves.)

442
00:14:45,435 --> 00:14:49,274
(Meanwhile, Kyung Nam enters too.)

443
00:14:49,275 --> 00:14:51,728
(Am I really alone here?)

444
00:14:52,704 --> 00:14:54,733
(Peeking)

445
00:14:56,645 --> 00:14:59,313
(Since there's nobody here, he won't feel shy.)

446
00:14:59,314 --> 00:15:02,446
(But being on a variety show is hard.)

447
00:15:03,324 --> 00:15:05,784
(And here's another newbie on variety shows.)

448
00:15:05,785 --> 00:15:08,592
(She freezes.)

449
00:15:08,593 --> 00:15:13,847
(What should I do? She's as lost as Kyung Nam.)

450
00:15:14,963 --> 00:15:18,035
I can last for nine hours.

451
00:15:18,265 --> 00:15:19,333
(Hold out for 9 hours, and get 10,000 dollars.)

452
00:15:19,334 --> 00:15:20,874
If I hold out for nine hours,

453
00:15:20,875 --> 00:15:22,552
I will get 10,000 dollars. Of course, I can do this.

454
00:15:23,405 --> 00:15:24,819
How much would the hourly rate be?

455
00:15:25,074 --> 00:15:27,842
It's almost 1,000 dollars per hour.

456
00:15:27,843 --> 00:15:29,601
Because we can take 10,000 dollars. Right?

457
00:15:29,645 --> 00:15:31,112
It's 1,000 dollars per hour.

458
00:15:31,113 --> 00:15:32,342
(This is totally doable.)

459
00:15:32,343 --> 00:15:33,363
Should I sleep?

460
00:15:34,814 --> 00:15:36,199
I can't even see anything from here.

461
00:15:38,385 --> 00:15:41,092
(Listening to sounds from outside)

462
00:15:41,093 --> 00:15:42,135
Hey!

463
00:15:44,425 --> 00:15:45,894
(Whom are you talking to?)

464
00:15:45,895 --> 00:15:47,232
(The solitary room is completely cut off from the outside world.)

465
00:15:47,233 --> 00:15:48,693
My gosh, I have nothing to do here.

466
00:15:48,694 --> 00:15:50,452
I'm going crazy without my phone.

467
00:15:51,564 --> 00:15:53,073
(At that moment,)

468
00:15:53,074 --> 00:15:55,862
(Ji Hyo finds a small stone.)

469
00:15:57,005 --> 00:15:59,742
(Picking up the stone)

470
00:15:59,743 --> 00:16:02,916
(Why is there a stone here?)

471
00:16:03,685 --> 00:16:06,953
(Good. I was getting bored.)

472
00:16:06,954 --> 00:16:09,610
Hello? How did you end up here?

473
00:16:12,255 --> 00:16:15,325
In the movie, "Cast Away", there's...

474
00:16:15,525 --> 00:16:16,962
a volleyball.

475
00:16:16,963 --> 00:16:18,794
(He befriended the volleyball.)

476
00:16:18,795 --> 00:16:20,148
The ball became his friends.

477
00:16:21,064 --> 00:16:22,563
Can you be my friend too?

478
00:16:22,564 --> 00:16:25,404
(The inmate in Cell 9 shows signs of a mental disorder.)

479
00:16:25,405 --> 00:16:26,615
I should name you.

480
00:16:27,175 --> 00:16:28,304
You're S.

481
00:16:28,305 --> 00:16:29,485
(It's the 2nd Wilson.)

482
00:16:29,805 --> 00:16:31,044
I mean, this is...

483
00:16:31,045 --> 00:16:32,102
(Seok Jin can't stand being in the room alone.)

484
00:16:32,103 --> 00:16:34,073
I have no one to talk to. This is driving me crazy.

485
00:16:34,074 --> 00:16:35,342
I have to talk to someone.

486
00:16:35,343 --> 00:16:36,583
(Seok Jin can't stand being in the room alone.)

487
00:16:36,584 --> 00:16:38,565
(Yes, I've decided.)

488
00:16:39,084 --> 00:16:40,184
Hello?

489
00:16:40,185 --> 00:16:42,952
(He starts talking to the intercom system.)

490
00:16:43,285 --> 00:16:45,505
Is everything possible?

491
00:16:45,555 --> 00:16:46,624
Can you bring me water too?

492
00:16:46,625 --> 00:16:48,645
How much do a pen...

493
00:16:49,353 --> 00:16:51,484
and a piece of computer paper cost?

494
00:16:51,694 --> 00:16:54,394
A pen and a piece of paper cost 1,100 dollars.

495
00:16:54,395 --> 00:16:57,130
(A pen and a piece of paper cost 1,100 dollars.)

496
00:16:58,405 --> 00:17:01,970
A pen and a piece of paper cost 1,100 dollars?

497
00:17:03,175 --> 00:17:05,195
How much is a set of blankets?

498
00:17:05,805 --> 00:17:06,972
A blanket and a pillow cost 3,000 dollars.

499
00:17:06,973 --> 00:17:08,862
A blanket and a pillow cost 3,000 dollars.

500
00:17:09,444 --> 00:17:11,644
(As he snorts away, he refuses to talk.)

501
00:17:11,645 --> 00:17:13,584
(I knew it. It's so expensive.)

502
00:17:13,585 --> 00:17:16,754
I won't buy it. I won't buy it if it's 3,000 dollars.

503
00:17:18,185 --> 00:17:20,377
We have to stay here without spending money, right?

504
00:17:21,753 --> 00:17:25,401
(At that time, the inmate in Cell 10 talks on the intercom system.)

505
00:17:25,625 --> 00:17:27,481
- Hello? - Yes, go ahead.

506
00:17:28,533 --> 00:17:30,080
Can you cook me cup noodles?

507
00:17:30,435 --> 00:17:31,617
Yes, I can.

508
00:17:31,865 --> 00:17:32,915
How much is that?

509
00:17:33,175 --> 00:17:35,302
Cup noodles cost 1,500 dollars.

510
00:17:35,303 --> 00:17:38,302
- What about a meal box? - With the meal box,

511
00:17:38,303 --> 00:17:40,212
- it costs 4,000 dollars. - 4,000 dollars?

512
00:17:40,213 --> 00:17:43,144
(Cup noodles and the meal box cost 4,000 dollars?)

513
00:17:43,145 --> 00:17:45,042
Okay. I'll pay 4,000 dollars for them.

514
00:17:45,043 --> 00:17:47,684
(He only thinks about it for 1.5 seconds.)

515
00:17:47,685 --> 00:17:50,482
(Jae Seok in Room 10 spends money 1st with gusto.)

516
00:17:50,483 --> 00:17:54,363
This is all right. How can I just loiter around for an hour by myself?

517
00:17:54,493 --> 00:17:56,745
I should eat or do something.

518
00:17:57,763 --> 00:18:00,118
They'll be mad when they find out.

519
00:18:01,165 --> 00:18:02,749
Oh, it's here!

520
00:18:04,365 --> 00:18:07,203
(He sets his worries aside.)

521
00:18:07,335 --> 00:18:09,874
Thank you. Thank you.

522
00:18:09,875 --> 00:18:10,904
(He needs to focus on the food.)

523
00:18:10,905 --> 00:18:13,137
(I can't believe it's really here!)

524
00:18:14,415 --> 00:18:15,443
My gosh.

525
00:18:15,444 --> 00:18:16,684
(He secretly receives his food.)

526
00:18:16,685 --> 00:18:17,957
I ordered this.

527
00:18:19,283 --> 00:18:20,953
(He blows on the noodles first.)

528
00:18:20,954 --> 00:18:23,207
(Slurping)

529
00:18:24,355 --> 00:18:25,584
(It's scrumptious.)

530
00:18:25,585 --> 00:18:26,635
It's so good.

531
00:18:29,194 --> 00:18:31,222
(Suddenly)

532
00:18:31,223 --> 00:18:33,193
(Knocking)

533
00:18:33,194 --> 00:18:36,434
(Who's knocking on the door?)

534
00:18:36,435 --> 00:18:40,647
(I'm not expecting any visitors.)

535
00:18:41,733 --> 00:18:44,531
(The staff brings in something else.)

536
00:18:45,973 --> 00:18:48,644
(It's pickled radish.)

537
00:18:48,645 --> 00:18:50,314
(Relieved)

538
00:18:50,315 --> 00:18:51,355
You startled me.

539
00:18:51,543 --> 00:18:52,898
Thank you.

540
00:18:53,185 --> 00:18:54,354
Thank you.

541
00:18:54,355 --> 00:18:55,712
You scared me for a minute.

542
00:18:55,713 --> 00:18:57,782
Thank you. Make sure the others don't spot you.

543
00:18:57,783 --> 00:18:59,354
(He receives the pickled radish.)

544
00:18:59,355 --> 00:19:00,522
(He's relieved.)

545
00:19:00,523 --> 00:19:01,666
I was so startled.

546
00:19:03,793 --> 00:19:05,946
They gave me pickled radish.

547
00:19:07,135 --> 00:19:11,364
(He eats the pickled radish.)

548
00:19:11,365 --> 00:19:13,456
(Slurping)

549
00:19:14,575 --> 00:19:16,344
(The pickled radish makes it even tastier.)

550
00:19:16,345 --> 00:19:17,385
This is great.

551
00:19:18,303 --> 00:19:20,272
I didn't order pickled radish, but they gave me some.

552
00:19:20,273 --> 00:19:21,772
(While he's busy eating,)

553
00:19:21,773 --> 00:19:24,512
(what is happening in Room 2?)

554
00:19:24,513 --> 00:19:26,230
There's one thing good about this.

555
00:19:26,355 --> 00:19:29,213
No matter what I say, no one can come in.

556
00:19:31,053 --> 00:19:33,252
Even if I curse at someone,

557
00:19:33,253 --> 00:19:34,752
I won't be punished.

558
00:19:34,753 --> 00:19:36,924
Kim Jong Kook!

559
00:19:36,925 --> 00:19:40,430
(Her target is Jong Kook.)

560
00:19:40,493 --> 00:19:42,762
Hey, Jong Kook!

561
00:19:42,763 --> 00:19:44,783
Catch me if you can!

562
00:19:45,763 --> 00:19:48,074
(My ears are itching.)

563
00:19:48,075 --> 00:19:50,196
(Whoever it is, I'll kill you.)

564
00:19:51,204 --> 00:19:53,871
(She's afraid for no reason.)

565
00:19:56,375 --> 00:19:57,742
Hello?

566
00:19:57,743 --> 00:19:59,531
(Kyung Nam is lost.)

567
00:19:59,713 --> 00:20:01,432
Hello?

568
00:20:02,713 --> 00:20:04,782
(Screaming)

569
00:20:04,783 --> 00:20:05,854
(She starts to act strange.)

570
00:20:05,855 --> 00:20:07,410
I'm neglected.

571
00:20:08,694 --> 00:20:10,814
What kind of show is this?

572
00:20:12,165 --> 00:20:14,594
I'd rather you pour water on us.

573
00:20:14,595 --> 00:20:16,352
Or slap us.

574
00:20:17,204 --> 00:20:19,334
What am I doing in here?

575
00:20:19,335 --> 00:20:21,434
What is this?

576
00:20:21,435 --> 00:20:24,806
(First open house.)

577
00:20:26,973 --> 00:20:28,256
It's been an hour.

578
00:20:28,915 --> 00:20:30,359
We can go out.

579
00:20:31,145 --> 00:20:32,144
What?

580
00:20:32,145 --> 00:20:33,512
(He can't clean the room,)

581
00:20:33,513 --> 00:20:36,755
(so he decides to clean his teeth.)

582
00:20:37,783 --> 00:20:39,066
Did you guys order anything?

583
00:20:39,425 --> 00:20:40,693
No, right?

584
00:20:40,694 --> 00:20:42,170
Did you guys eat anything?

585
00:20:42,454 --> 00:20:43,594
- What? - Hey.

586
00:20:43,595 --> 00:20:45,124
- What is that? - Someone used the money.

587
00:20:45,125 --> 00:20:46,732
(They look at the display board.)

588
00:20:46,733 --> 00:20:49,634
- Hey, who used the money? - What?

589
00:20:49,635 --> 00:20:50,834
Let's not do this.

590
00:20:50,835 --> 00:20:51,934
They spent 12,000 dollars.

591
00:20:51,935 --> 00:20:53,532
Someone used over 10,000 dollars!

592
00:20:53,533 --> 00:20:56,002
(11,500 dollars are deducted.)

593
00:20:56,003 --> 00:20:58,242
The number of digits changed.

594
00:20:58,243 --> 00:21:00,443
It wasn't me. I swear.

595
00:21:00,444 --> 00:21:01,472
- It was you. - No, it wasn't.

596
00:21:01,473 --> 00:21:02,814
- You ate, didn't you? - Seok Jin.

597
00:21:02,815 --> 00:21:03,844
- It wasn't me. - Esom.

598
00:21:03,845 --> 00:21:05,227
- What? - Did you use the money?

599
00:21:05,415 --> 00:21:06,584
- No. - You did, right?

600
00:21:06,585 --> 00:21:07,614
- I didn't. - You did, right?

601
00:21:07,615 --> 00:21:09,252
No, I didn't.

602
00:21:09,253 --> 00:21:10,453
Everyone.

603
00:21:10,454 --> 00:21:12,782
For the next 30 minutes,

604
00:21:12,783 --> 00:21:15,154
you have to stay out here.

605
00:21:15,155 --> 00:21:16,722
(They have to be with each other.)

606
00:21:16,723 --> 00:21:17,962
Gosh.

607
00:21:17,963 --> 00:21:20,094
- That's horrible. - Why do I smell cup noodles on you?

608
00:21:20,095 --> 00:21:21,094
What do you mean?

609
00:21:21,095 --> 00:21:23,404
(Why do I smell noodles on you?)

610
00:21:23,405 --> 00:21:25,364
- He's reeking of it. - Right?

611
00:21:25,365 --> 00:21:27,404
- No? - You're just being suspicious.

612
00:21:27,405 --> 00:21:28,703
I'm sure he spent it.

613
00:21:28,704 --> 00:21:29,772
- No. - Come on.

614
00:21:29,773 --> 00:21:31,302
- His clothes smell of it. - I smell it.

615
00:21:31,303 --> 00:21:32,416
(They gather around him.)

616
00:21:33,213 --> 00:21:34,443
(You did eat!)

617
00:21:34,444 --> 00:21:35,674
You ate it!

618
00:21:35,675 --> 00:21:37,200
- Darn it! - You did eat.

619
00:21:38,013 --> 00:21:39,644
- How could you? - I smell?

620
00:21:39,645 --> 00:21:40,854
- Right? - Wait.

621
00:21:40,855 --> 00:21:42,114
- I smell it. - Hold on.

622
00:21:42,115 --> 00:21:43,324
- It's not me. - I smell it.

623
00:21:43,325 --> 00:21:45,252
- I smell it too. - No, it's not me.

624
00:21:45,253 --> 00:21:46,396
Don't lie!

625
00:21:46,483 --> 00:21:48,292
- Jae Seok. - I smell it!

626
00:21:48,293 --> 00:21:50,522
- Hey. - Did you bathe in the broth?

627
00:21:50,523 --> 00:21:52,280
- Hey. - Hey.

628
00:21:52,523 --> 00:21:54,164
- Hold on. - We need to eat naked.

629
00:21:54,165 --> 00:21:55,962
- Hold on. - We do.

630
00:21:55,963 --> 00:21:57,434
- Wait a minute. - So this is what we're doing?

631
00:21:57,435 --> 00:21:59,434
Fine! I had noodles!

632
00:21:59,435 --> 00:22:01,374
- Hey! - But...

633
00:22:01,375 --> 00:22:03,104
- I didn't spend it all. - No?

634
00:22:03,105 --> 00:22:04,862
- You know, right? - I do.

635
00:22:04,944 --> 00:22:06,914
- I'll tell you one thing. - Okay.

636
00:22:06,915 --> 00:22:08,792
- He ate it. - I didn't...

637
00:22:09,075 --> 00:22:11,684
I didn't order pickled radish, but I got some.

638
00:22:11,685 --> 00:22:14,552
(I didn't order pickled radish, but I got some.)

639
00:22:14,553 --> 00:22:16,482
You should take it back.

640
00:22:16,483 --> 00:22:18,301
(Who ordered it?)

641
00:22:19,185 --> 00:22:20,912
It wasn't me. I swear!

642
00:22:20,954 --> 00:22:22,236
I swear!

643
00:22:22,655 --> 00:22:23,734
Gosh!

644
00:22:23,963 --> 00:22:25,137
- Tell them! - How dare you?

645
00:22:25,865 --> 00:22:27,564
- Explain it to them! - Wait a minute.

646
00:22:27,565 --> 00:22:28,605
It was you.

647
00:22:28,895 --> 00:22:31,802
(The culprit was someone else.)

648
00:22:31,803 --> 00:22:34,104
The smell is too strong.

649
00:22:34,105 --> 00:22:35,590
(It was Jong Kook.)

650
00:22:36,335 --> 00:22:39,344
(To prevent the smell from seeping into his clothes,)

651
00:22:39,345 --> 00:22:41,772
(he threw his clothes in the corner of the room.)

652
00:22:41,773 --> 00:22:43,844
It's over if I get the broth on my clothes.

653
00:22:43,845 --> 00:22:45,742
(He carefully opened the jjamppong.)

654
00:22:45,743 --> 00:22:48,712
(He then began eating.)

655
00:22:48,713 --> 00:22:50,066
(Savoring)

656
00:22:50,723 --> 00:22:52,782
(It tastes better in secret.)

657
00:22:52,783 --> 00:22:53,824
(He didn't get the pickled radish, but he finished his food.)

658
00:22:53,825 --> 00:22:55,292
This is really good.

659
00:22:55,293 --> 00:22:57,164
(He didn't get the pickled radish, but he finished his food.)

660
00:22:57,165 --> 00:22:58,522
Hold on.

661
00:22:58,523 --> 00:23:00,792
- What? - The smell of the noodles...

662
00:23:00,793 --> 00:23:02,394
- is reeking. - It is.

663
00:23:02,395 --> 00:23:03,979
That's because we didn't eat anything.

664
00:23:04,303 --> 00:23:06,050
(But I did.)

665
00:23:06,303 --> 00:23:07,434
It's not me!

666
00:23:07,435 --> 00:23:08,647
(He's falsely blamed.)

667
00:23:09,435 --> 00:23:10,703
- I... Fine. - I don't smell...

668
00:23:10,704 --> 00:23:12,344
- anything on him. - We're secluded in there.

669
00:23:12,345 --> 00:23:13,658
If you're going to accuse me,

670
00:23:13,845 --> 00:23:16,237
then I'll show you how to spend 80,000 dollars in an hour.

671
00:23:17,145 --> 00:23:18,982
- Look at him. - I'll get hit by Jong Kook.

672
00:23:18,983 --> 00:23:20,252
Hey, hey.

673
00:23:20,253 --> 00:23:22,512
Kyung Nam keeps acting innocent,

674
00:23:22,513 --> 00:23:23,735
- but... - What?

675
00:23:23,825 --> 00:23:25,124
- He's suspicious. - Did you eat anything?

676
00:23:25,125 --> 00:23:26,854
- I didn't. - I bet he ordered something.

677
00:23:26,855 --> 00:23:28,193
- You have something on you! - Look at his lips.

678
00:23:28,194 --> 00:23:29,204
(They suspect him.)

679
00:23:29,655 --> 00:23:31,693
- Look. - Come here. Come here.

680
00:23:31,694 --> 00:23:32,992
What is this?

681
00:23:32,993 --> 00:23:34,106
(They find something on his lip.)

682
00:23:35,233 --> 00:23:37,064
- You had bread, didn't you? - Gosh.

683
00:23:37,065 --> 00:23:38,134
(What's on my lip?)

684
00:23:38,135 --> 00:23:39,364
- What is this? - He ate something.

685
00:23:39,365 --> 00:23:41,032
- What is it? - Hey.

686
00:23:41,033 --> 00:23:42,232
You ate something, didn't you?

687
00:23:42,233 --> 00:23:43,443
- What is this? - You had something.

688
00:23:43,444 --> 00:23:44,972
- It's just dead skin. - He said it's dead skin.

689
00:23:44,973 --> 00:23:46,761
(He explains.)

690
00:23:47,075 --> 00:23:48,574
- He said it's dead skin. - You ate something, right?

691
00:23:48,575 --> 00:23:49,982
- It's just dead skin. - So Min.

692
00:23:49,983 --> 00:23:51,429
- It's dead skin. - It's dead skin.

693
00:23:52,013 --> 00:23:53,953
- It's dead skin. - It's dead skin.

694
00:23:53,954 --> 00:23:56,482
(A simple dead skin has made him look suspicious.)

695
00:23:56,483 --> 00:23:58,271
I had to hand in my lip balm.

696
00:23:59,325 --> 00:24:02,022
(Their first open house ends with them suspecting each other.)

697
00:24:02,023 --> 00:24:03,424
How about the others?

698
00:24:03,425 --> 00:24:04,978
- How about the others? - Right?

699
00:24:05,125 --> 00:24:07,185
- All right. - You guys better not spend any.

700
00:24:07,963 --> 00:24:09,032
We have seven hours left.

701
00:24:09,033 --> 00:24:10,518
(They go back into their rooms.)

702
00:24:10,803 --> 00:24:12,762
I didn't know you'd reek.

703
00:24:12,763 --> 00:24:13,813
When...

704
00:24:13,905 --> 00:24:16,732
When I was next to Jae Seok, I could smell it so easily.

705
00:24:18,204 --> 00:24:20,233
It must be a clear zone out there.

706
00:24:20,375 --> 00:24:21,989
It must be.

707
00:24:22,513 --> 00:24:24,344
(In Room 3)

708
00:24:24,345 --> 00:24:26,212
I should continue eating.

709
00:24:26,213 --> 00:24:28,084
(What?)

710
00:24:28,085 --> 00:24:30,782
(Why is there cup noodles in Room 3?)

711
00:24:30,783 --> 00:24:34,124
I'm sure they could smell this.

712
00:24:34,125 --> 00:24:36,953
(Let's see what happened.)

713
00:24:37,625 --> 00:24:40,634
(She was the first one to reach for the intercom.)

714
00:24:40,635 --> 00:24:42,164
I'm a bit hungry.

715
00:24:42,165 --> 00:24:45,002
Can I have some noodles?

716
00:24:45,003 --> 00:24:46,134
Cup noodles, please.

717
00:24:46,135 --> 00:24:48,802
(She was also a culprit.)

718
00:24:48,803 --> 00:24:50,926
It was so difficult to pretend that I didn't order anything.

719
00:24:54,415 --> 00:24:57,142
(It really tastes the best when you eat it in secret.)

720
00:24:58,213 --> 00:25:00,174
(I might as well go all out.)

721
00:25:03,283 --> 00:25:04,495
Could you...

722
00:25:04,685 --> 00:25:06,992
bring my comb?

723
00:25:06,993 --> 00:25:08,154
How much is it?

724
00:25:08,155 --> 00:25:09,640
500 dollars.

725
00:25:10,065 --> 00:25:11,580
Will you purchase it?

726
00:25:11,694 --> 00:25:14,927
(500 dollars to retrieve my own comb?)

727
00:25:16,165 --> 00:25:18,155
Okay, I'll buy it.

728
00:25:18,435 --> 00:25:21,465
(At least, the comb won't reek of any smells.)

729
00:25:23,444 --> 00:25:25,425
I can use this as a mirror.

730
00:25:25,875 --> 00:25:28,772
(She uses the silverware as a mirror.)

731
00:25:30,085 --> 00:25:32,408
(She finds her situation hilarious.)

732
00:25:33,013 --> 00:25:35,012
(So far, 10,000 dollars have been used.)

733
00:25:35,013 --> 00:25:37,252
If they suspect me even if I didn't order anything,

734
00:25:37,253 --> 00:25:38,971
then I might as well order something.

735
00:25:39,723 --> 00:25:43,361
I can't do this with them anymore.

736
00:25:44,694 --> 00:25:46,934
(He reaches for the intercom.)

737
00:25:46,935 --> 00:25:48,884
Can I call for a chef?

738
00:25:48,963 --> 00:25:50,721
We only serve delivery food.

739
00:25:51,905 --> 00:25:53,217
Then I'd like some cup noodles,

740
00:25:53,875 --> 00:25:55,390
a bowl of rice, chopsticks,

741
00:25:55,605 --> 00:25:57,290
a blanket, a pillow,

742
00:25:57,375 --> 00:25:58,617
two hot packs,

743
00:25:58,803 --> 00:26:00,128
a chair,

744
00:26:00,315 --> 00:26:02,174
and a fabric deodorizer.

745
00:26:02,175 --> 00:26:03,242
(It's a total of 8,000 dollars.)

746
00:26:03,243 --> 00:26:04,982
Let me ask about the price first.

747
00:26:04,983 --> 00:26:06,414
How much is a cushion?

748
00:26:06,415 --> 00:26:08,534
A cushion costs 500 dollars.

749
00:26:09,085 --> 00:26:10,295
It's too expensive.

750
00:26:10,925 --> 00:26:12,339
How about fried chicken?

751
00:26:12,685 --> 00:26:14,614
I'd like a bowl of jjajangmyeon...

752
00:26:14,993 --> 00:26:16,771
and fried dumplings.

753
00:26:16,865 --> 00:26:19,962
And a bottle of water in case I have an upset stomach.

754
00:26:19,963 --> 00:26:21,894
(The inmates in Cell 6 and 7 are starving as well.)

755
00:26:21,895 --> 00:26:23,107
Cup noodles,

756
00:26:24,605 --> 00:26:25,878
chopsticks,

757
00:26:26,605 --> 00:26:27,744
water,

758
00:26:27,905 --> 00:26:30,097
and pickled radish.

759
00:26:30,743 --> 00:26:31,783
Thank you.

760
00:26:33,145 --> 00:26:34,174
I have no choice.

761
00:26:34,175 --> 00:26:36,264
I need to eat to live.

762
00:26:37,085 --> 00:26:38,600
Let's be in good spirits.

763
00:26:39,385 --> 00:26:40,453
Let's forget about it.

764
00:26:40,454 --> 00:26:46,009
(Like so, everyone spends money during their second confinement.)

765
00:26:47,194 --> 00:26:49,577
(Meanwhile, in Room 1...)

766
00:26:51,595 --> 00:26:53,413
(He's in a dilemma.)

767
00:26:54,365 --> 00:26:55,577
I'll try to hold it in.

768
00:26:55,763 --> 00:26:57,684
I need to go to the bathroom.

769
00:26:59,003 --> 00:27:00,134
I need to go.

770
00:27:00,135 --> 00:27:03,404
(I'll need to spend money to go to the bathroom.)

771
00:27:03,405 --> 00:27:05,524
I have to stay here for seven hours.

772
00:27:05,803 --> 00:27:07,374
(He's restless.)

773
00:27:07,375 --> 00:27:09,144
I have to stay here for seven hours.

774
00:27:09,145 --> 00:27:10,782
(Can I hold it in?)

775
00:27:10,783 --> 00:27:12,330
The best thing...

776
00:27:12,415 --> 00:27:13,698
is to sleep.

777
00:27:15,013 --> 00:27:16,354
(I wonder what everyone else is doing in this silence.)

778
00:27:16,355 --> 00:27:18,345
Everyone's so quiet.

779
00:27:20,155 --> 00:27:22,324
(What are we doing?)

780
00:27:22,325 --> 00:27:24,664
(We're spending money.)

781
00:27:24,665 --> 00:27:27,695
(He's showing the quintessence of living alone.)

782
00:27:28,793 --> 00:27:32,502
(A cozy blanket and hot packs)

783
00:27:32,503 --> 00:27:35,404
(A fabric deodorizer and mouthwash, the must-haves for a perfect crime)

784
00:27:35,875 --> 00:27:39,178
(Welcome to Kwang Soo's lovely Room 4.)

785
00:27:39,743 --> 00:27:41,331
It's so warm already.

786
00:27:43,375 --> 00:27:45,405
I should just stay true to who I am.

787
00:27:46,483 --> 00:27:49,953
(Now that he's all settled in, he decides to eat.)

788
00:27:49,954 --> 00:27:53,124
(He has cup noodles,)

789
00:27:53,125 --> 00:27:54,752
(a chair,)

790
00:27:54,753 --> 00:27:56,773
(and a camera.)

791
00:27:58,625 --> 00:28:01,423
(He positions his food near the camera.)

792
00:28:04,435 --> 00:28:05,920
(I'm all ready.)

793
00:28:06,935 --> 00:28:09,024
Hello, everyone. This is Lee Kwang Soo.

794
00:28:09,935 --> 00:28:13,302
Today, I will have your favorite, cup noodles.

795
00:28:13,303 --> 00:28:14,614
(Today's mukbang is cup noodles.)

796
00:28:14,615 --> 00:28:16,967
I will eat cup noodles today.

797
00:28:16,983 --> 00:28:20,013
Personally, I like my noodles a bit salty.

798
00:28:21,185 --> 00:28:22,831
So I poured in a bit less water.

799
00:28:23,385 --> 00:28:24,668
Do you see the steam?

800
00:28:25,855 --> 00:28:28,317
(Hurry up and eat. I'm dying.)

801
00:28:31,325 --> 00:28:32,911
Is it working?

802
00:28:33,325 --> 00:28:36,668
(He checks to see if the angle is right.)

803
00:28:38,365 --> 00:28:40,961
(Let me turn this.)

804
00:28:42,704 --> 00:28:44,866
(This will be enough.)

805
00:28:47,145 --> 00:28:49,264
(He spills the noodles.)

806
00:28:49,875 --> 00:28:53,178
(He makes a big mistake.)

807
00:28:53,243 --> 00:28:55,942
(That's 1,500 dollars on the floor.)

808
00:28:56,315 --> 00:28:57,565
That's so hot.

809
00:28:58,753 --> 00:29:00,199
(My noodles...)

810
00:29:00,793 --> 00:29:03,451
(He makes an irreversible mistake.)

811
00:29:04,194 --> 00:29:06,792
I'll see you all next time.

812
00:29:06,793 --> 00:29:08,005
(He fails to shoot a mukbang.)

813
00:29:09,733 --> 00:29:11,319
Darn it.

814
00:29:11,343 --> 00:29:14,343
<font color="#fcc89b">[VIU Ver] SBS E449 Running Man</font>

<font color="#ff5fa2">-♥ Ruo Xi ♥-</font>

815
00:29:14,435 --> 00:29:17,130
How much is it for a fabric deodorizer?

816
00:29:17,204 --> 00:29:18,356
1,000 dollars.

817
00:29:18,473 --> 00:29:20,939
I'll take it. Please bring it.

818
00:29:22,273 --> 00:29:25,242
I need it if I want to go out. It smells so much in here.

819
00:29:25,713 --> 00:29:28,309
That's so expensive, though. I just need to use it once.

820
00:29:28,815 --> 00:29:30,282
(Spraying)

821
00:29:30,283 --> 00:29:32,424
(He showers himself with the fabric deodorizer.)

822
00:29:32,425 --> 00:29:35,222
(He and So Min are thinking about the same thing.)

823
00:29:35,655 --> 00:29:38,150
(This is a nice trick.)

824
00:29:38,925 --> 00:29:41,722
Okay. Okay, this is good.

825
00:29:42,065 --> 00:29:45,732
(Meanwhile)

826
00:29:45,733 --> 00:29:48,834
(I don't need to go. I don't.)

827
00:29:48,905 --> 00:29:51,400
(He tries to keep it in.)

828
00:29:53,243 --> 00:29:56,346
We've used over 10,000 dollars already. It'll be all right.

829
00:29:57,815 --> 00:29:58,896
How much is it?

830
00:29:59,243 --> 00:30:01,712
How much is it to go to the bathroom?

831
00:30:01,713 --> 00:30:04,222
It costs 2,000 dollars.

832
00:30:04,223 --> 00:30:06,522
Okay. All right.

833
00:30:06,523 --> 00:30:08,444
(Hopeless)

834
00:30:08,553 --> 00:30:09,968
My goodness.

835
00:30:11,293 --> 00:30:15,262
(That's a bit too expensive.)

836
00:30:15,263 --> 00:30:16,834
I wonder if they've bought anything.

837
00:30:16,835 --> 00:30:17,916
(He's curious.)

838
00:30:20,263 --> 00:30:21,834
(Se Chan is almost done...)

839
00:30:21,835 --> 00:30:23,434
(with his jjajangmyeon and fried dumplings.)

840
00:30:23,435 --> 00:30:24,617
I'll dip it in the jjajangmyeon sauce.

841
00:30:25,375 --> 00:30:27,344
(Ringing)

842
00:30:27,345 --> 00:30:29,542
(The siren is sounded.)

843
00:30:29,543 --> 00:30:31,100
(He's in a haste.)

844
00:30:31,615 --> 00:30:33,362
(He wipes his mouth first...)

845
00:30:33,983 --> 00:30:37,012
(and then prepares to rinse his mouth.)

846
00:30:37,013 --> 00:30:38,740
(I have no time.)

847
00:30:39,253 --> 00:30:41,924
(He takes one big gulp.)

848
00:30:41,925 --> 00:30:44,349
(He accidentally spits some out.)

849
00:30:45,125 --> 00:30:46,992
(Relax)

850
00:30:46,993 --> 00:30:48,548
(Meanwhile...)

851
00:30:49,194 --> 00:30:50,292
Wait a minute.

852
00:30:50,293 --> 00:30:51,364
(Kwang Soo is panicking the most.)

853
00:30:51,365 --> 00:30:53,322
(How should I clean this up?)

854
00:30:54,273 --> 00:30:56,223
(He also purchased wet tissues to clean up the mess.)

855
00:30:57,204 --> 00:30:58,356
Darn it.

856
00:30:59,043 --> 00:31:01,414
(He puts on a spurt to get rid of the smell.)

857
00:31:01,415 --> 00:31:04,344
(I'm not sure if this will work, but I'll have to try.)

858
00:31:04,345 --> 00:31:06,708
(He gargles his mouth.)

859
00:31:07,043 --> 00:31:09,578
(He's doing the best he can to hide his crimes.)

860
00:31:10,885 --> 00:31:13,450
(He goes out without his shoes on.)

861
00:31:14,194 --> 00:31:16,477
(We hope you come back alive.)

862
00:31:17,723 --> 00:31:20,462
(Second open house)

863
00:31:21,335 --> 00:31:23,262
(How much did they spend this time around?)

864
00:31:23,263 --> 00:31:24,313
How much do we have left?

865
00:31:25,065 --> 00:31:26,104
How much?

866
00:31:26,105 --> 00:31:27,104
(How much did they spend this time around?)

867
00:31:27,105 --> 00:31:29,630
What? No way!

868
00:31:29,835 --> 00:31:32,772
- How could that be possible? - Have you guys gone insane?

869
00:31:32,773 --> 00:31:33,772
(How much is left?)

870
00:31:33,773 --> 00:31:34,874
My gosh.

871
00:31:34,875 --> 00:31:38,075
That's... That's too harsh.

872
00:31:38,885 --> 00:31:40,703
- You scumbags. - You...

873
00:31:41,253 --> 00:31:42,712
You just spent mindlessly.

874
00:31:42,713 --> 00:31:44,341
- Seriously. - Are they insane?

875
00:31:44,855 --> 00:31:46,540
That's all that we have left?

876
00:31:47,723 --> 00:31:49,541
Kwang Soo.

877
00:31:49,825 --> 00:31:51,722
- I got a glimpse of you. - What?

878
00:31:51,723 --> 00:31:53,714
Let me smell you. Come here.

879
00:31:54,165 --> 00:31:56,193
- I didn't purchase anything. - I smell fabric deodorizer on him.

880
00:31:56,194 --> 00:31:57,302
- I didn't get anything. - Hey.

881
00:31:57,303 --> 00:31:58,934
He bought a fabric deodorizer.

882
00:31:58,935 --> 00:32:00,472
No, no. I really didn't.

883
00:32:00,473 --> 00:32:01,616
My gosh.

884
00:32:02,135 --> 00:32:04,844
You ate something too.

885
00:32:04,845 --> 00:32:06,542
What did you eat?

886
00:32:06,543 --> 00:32:08,114
- Is it that hard not to eat? - Kim Kyung Nam.

887
00:32:08,115 --> 00:32:09,212
- I didn't eat. - You did.

888
00:32:09,213 --> 00:32:11,042
- No, I didn't. - Don't lie.

889
00:32:11,043 --> 00:32:13,614
- Next door... - You all spent 40,000 dollars.

890
00:32:13,615 --> 00:32:15,130
- You all spent money. - Goodness.

891
00:32:15,155 --> 00:32:17,982
Did you buy a fabric deodorizer? You smell so nice.

892
00:32:18,125 --> 00:32:19,782
- You do. - Hold on.

893
00:32:19,783 --> 00:32:20,906
You spent money.

894
00:32:21,095 --> 00:32:22,292
Move back.

895
00:32:22,293 --> 00:32:23,424
Do you want some water?

896
00:32:23,425 --> 00:32:25,064
- Can you give me some? - Sure.

897
00:32:25,065 --> 00:32:26,693
(Esom tries to get rid of evidence by offering some.)

898
00:32:26,694 --> 00:32:28,732
- Kyung Nam. Hey. - Do you want some?

899
00:32:28,733 --> 00:32:30,094
- Can I? - Yes.

900
00:32:30,095 --> 00:32:31,749
Hey, look at him.

901
00:32:32,105 --> 00:32:34,532
He must've been in a hurry doing something to have...

902
00:32:34,533 --> 00:32:36,634
- forgotten his shoes. - It's not like that.

903
00:32:36,635 --> 00:32:38,160
No, I took them off on purpose.

904
00:32:38,204 --> 00:32:40,302
- You didn't wear any shoes? - This is...

905
00:32:40,303 --> 00:32:41,325
(They're sure he was eating something.)

906
00:32:41,513 --> 00:32:43,074
I had them off to begin with.

907
00:32:43,075 --> 00:32:44,760
I had my reasons.

908
00:32:45,043 --> 00:32:46,212
What is this in your pocket?

909
00:32:46,213 --> 00:32:47,453
(Se Chan spots something.)

910
00:32:47,454 --> 00:32:49,282
- What? Why? - Oh, come on.

911
00:32:49,283 --> 00:32:50,314
(I didn't hide anything.)

912
00:32:50,315 --> 00:32:53,052
(A fried dumpling is found.)

913
00:32:53,053 --> 00:32:55,275
- What is this? - Why?

914
00:32:56,155 --> 00:32:57,693
(No one's surprised by it.)

915
00:32:57,694 --> 00:32:58,693
- What is it? - What is this?

916
00:32:58,694 --> 00:33:00,324
It's not me. What is this?

917
00:33:00,325 --> 00:33:02,934
- Come on. - This isn't mine!

918
00:33:02,935 --> 00:33:04,802
- Why was there a fried dumpling? - Goodness.

919
00:33:04,803 --> 00:33:07,032
- My goodness. - A fried dumpling?

920
00:33:07,033 --> 00:33:09,334
- What is that? - How is that possible?

921
00:33:09,335 --> 00:33:11,443
- He had it in his pocket. - It's not mine!

922
00:33:11,444 --> 00:33:13,404
- What did you order in there? - How dare you lie to us?

923
00:33:13,405 --> 00:33:14,712
- It was in his pocket. - What are you talking about?

924
00:33:14,713 --> 00:33:15,972
- A fried dumpling? - No.

925
00:33:15,973 --> 00:33:17,414
- It doesn't make any sense. - How could he?

926
00:33:17,415 --> 00:33:19,712
And you sprayed fabric deodorizer on yourself.

927
00:33:19,713 --> 00:33:21,414
- Hey. - No, I didn't.

928
00:33:21,415 --> 00:33:22,914
(The scent is mixed in with the food's scent.)

929
00:33:22,915 --> 00:33:24,722
- Hey. - I had my reasons.

930
00:33:24,723 --> 00:33:26,424
- It's not me. - I can't believe you.

931
00:33:26,425 --> 00:33:27,504
Seriously.

932
00:33:28,194 --> 00:33:29,924
Did we use over 40,000 dollars?

933
00:33:29,925 --> 00:33:31,722
- 41,900 dollars. - Yes.

934
00:33:31,723 --> 00:33:35,603
You fools! We could've split the money.

935
00:33:35,895 --> 00:33:38,834
I'm telling you in advance. I'm going to spend 20,000 dollars.

936
00:33:38,835 --> 00:33:41,574
- I'm curious about Jae Seok's room. - Me too.

937
00:33:41,575 --> 00:33:43,272
- Me too. - Me too.

938
00:33:43,273 --> 00:33:45,768
- Me too. - There's nothing in my room.

939
00:33:45,773 --> 00:33:46,802
I'm so curious.

940
00:33:46,803 --> 00:33:48,512
(He's in danger.)

941
00:33:48,513 --> 00:33:50,058
Let's play a Race of Wits.

942
00:33:50,345 --> 00:33:51,525
- Race of Wits? - One.

943
00:33:53,145 --> 00:33:54,195
- 2. - 2.

944
00:33:55,615 --> 00:33:57,012
(So Min and Esom are chosen.)

945
00:33:57,013 --> 00:33:58,782
- Oh, no. - It's them two.

946
00:33:58,783 --> 00:34:00,924
- This is good. Let's pick So Min. - Yes.

947
00:34:00,925 --> 00:34:02,252
- Right. - I'm curious.

948
00:34:02,253 --> 00:34:04,222
Let's look at your room.

949
00:34:04,223 --> 00:34:05,693
I have nothing to hide.

950
00:34:05,694 --> 00:34:07,334
- Then let's see it. - Let's go to Room Two.

951
00:34:07,335 --> 00:34:08,894
- Let's go. - I bet it's like...

952
00:34:08,895 --> 00:34:10,164
a luxury room in there.

953
00:34:10,165 --> 00:34:11,274
Let's go inside.

954
00:34:12,033 --> 00:34:13,681
- Let's go. - Let's go.

955
00:34:13,735 --> 00:34:15,592
I feel so wrongly blamed.

956
00:34:15,735 --> 00:34:18,173
I didn't spend much compared to them.

957
00:34:18,174 --> 00:34:20,814
I hope you all know that.

958
00:34:20,815 --> 00:34:23,144
- Seriously. - I'm so upset.

959
00:34:23,145 --> 00:34:24,144
Let's see.

960
00:34:24,145 --> 00:34:25,283
(How does her room look?)

961
00:34:25,284 --> 00:34:26,860
- She has a cushion. - Let's see.

962
00:34:27,284 --> 00:34:30,452
- Goodness. - There are cup noodles.

963
00:34:30,453 --> 00:34:31,553
(There's quite a bit in here.)

964
00:34:31,554 --> 00:34:32,553
Look at that.

965
00:34:32,554 --> 00:34:34,294
- There's green tea. - She drank green tea?

966
00:34:34,295 --> 00:34:35,894
- She had a party in here. - She had cup noodles.

967
00:34:35,895 --> 00:34:38,323
- How much was the green tea? - Goodness.

968
00:34:38,324 --> 00:34:41,224
- My gosh. - All right. Let's leave.

969
00:34:41,235 --> 00:34:42,633
- Please leave. - I can't believe her.

970
00:34:42,634 --> 00:34:45,334
Jae Seok is surprised to see that...

971
00:34:45,335 --> 00:34:46,734
I have fewer things that he does.

972
00:34:46,735 --> 00:34:48,033
- We need to check his room. - Hey.

973
00:34:48,034 --> 00:34:49,633
- There's nothing in my room. - We need...

974
00:34:49,634 --> 00:34:51,903
- to see his room. - It wasn't that bad.

975
00:34:51,904 --> 00:34:53,104
Kwang Soo's room is the worst.

976
00:34:53,105 --> 00:34:54,973
- I bet he has a book in there. - So Min's wasn't too bad.

977
00:34:54,974 --> 00:34:56,894
I bet Kwang Soo has a game controller or a TV.

978
00:34:57,985 --> 00:34:59,144
Did you buy a fabric deodorizer?

979
00:34:59,145 --> 00:35:00,872
- What? - Did you buy it?

980
00:35:01,415 --> 00:35:04,423
To be honest, I almost got teary-eyed in there.

981
00:35:04,424 --> 00:35:06,354
- She didn't spend much. - Look at him.

982
00:35:06,355 --> 00:35:08,923
- I mean, she was... - Let's check Kwang Soo's room.

983
00:35:08,924 --> 00:35:10,524
- Let's do that. - All right.

984
00:35:10,525 --> 00:35:12,464
- There's nothing in there. - Look at how...

985
00:35:12,465 --> 00:35:14,294
- he even forgot his shoes. - Let's vote.

986
00:35:14,295 --> 00:35:16,294
- Lee Kwang Soo. - Who wants to see his room?

987
00:35:16,295 --> 00:35:17,564
- Me. - Me.

988
00:35:17,565 --> 00:35:18,934
Is this allowed?

989
00:35:18,935 --> 00:35:19,934
(Do you want to see his room?)

990
00:35:19,935 --> 00:35:22,731
(Let's go to Room 4!)

991
00:35:22,875 --> 00:35:24,318
Why aren't you stopping them?

992
00:35:24,904 --> 00:35:26,604
Wait! Why are you doing this?

993
00:35:26,605 --> 00:35:27,787
(Running Man supports democracy.)

994
00:35:28,574 --> 00:35:30,544
- Wait. Why? - Why are you so surprised?

995
00:35:30,545 --> 00:35:33,184
- You could've spent all the money. - You can't just barge in!

996
00:35:33,185 --> 00:35:34,513
This makes no sense!

997
00:35:34,514 --> 00:35:35,697
(The door to his room opens.)

998
00:35:36,784 --> 00:35:38,743
- Look at you. - He's insane.

999
00:35:38,924 --> 00:35:40,823
- Look at this. - What is this?

1000
00:35:40,824 --> 00:35:42,624
- Hey. - What is this?

1001
00:35:42,625 --> 00:35:44,624
- Gosh. - Have you gone insane?

1002
00:35:44,625 --> 00:35:46,323
- What is this? - There are wet tissues.

1003
00:35:46,324 --> 00:35:48,194
- What is this? - He didn't even eat it.

1004
00:35:48,195 --> 00:35:49,894
- What is this? - He didn't even bother to eat.

1005
00:35:49,895 --> 00:35:51,334
I spilled cup noodles!

1006
00:35:51,335 --> 00:35:53,384
(You have no idea!)

1007
00:35:54,304 --> 00:35:55,434
- Come out. - I spilled it.

1008
00:35:55,435 --> 00:35:57,202
- Come out. - I wanted to do a mukbang,

1009
00:35:57,203 --> 00:35:58,303
- but I spilled it. - My goodness.

1010
00:35:58,304 --> 00:36:00,274
He's not a decent human being.

1011
00:36:00,275 --> 00:36:02,073
I think he spent about 20,000 dollars.

1012
00:36:02,074 --> 00:36:04,283
- I can smell it. - You spent 20,000 dollars, right?

1013
00:36:04,284 --> 00:36:05,544
- I think so. - I can't believe him.

1014
00:36:05,545 --> 00:36:06,914
My goodness.

1015
00:36:06,915 --> 00:36:09,984
Hold on. Time out. That means that fried dumpling was Se Chan's.

1016
00:36:09,985 --> 00:36:11,723
(She has an epiphany.)

1017
00:36:11,724 --> 00:36:12,723
- No, it's not. - It's yours.

1018
00:36:12,724 --> 00:36:14,694
- Se Chan, come here. - No, it's not me.

1019
00:36:14,695 --> 00:36:16,946
I didn't order any fried dumplings!

1020
00:36:17,054 --> 00:36:19,323
- Hey. - You had jjamppong.

1021
00:36:19,324 --> 00:36:20,624
- No, I only had the dumplings. - He ordered it.

1022
00:36:20,625 --> 00:36:23,033
- He had Chinese food. - I only spent 2,000 dollars.

1023
00:36:23,034 --> 00:36:25,104
- You ordered Chinese food. - It was 2,000 dollars.

1024
00:36:25,105 --> 00:36:27,633
- You have to stay for nine hours. - I know.

1025
00:36:27,634 --> 00:36:29,088
It has been three hours so far.

1026
00:36:30,435 --> 00:36:33,231
(They need to protect the remaining money.)

1027
00:36:33,775 --> 00:36:35,632
Let's not spend anymore.

1028
00:36:35,815 --> 00:36:37,144
- Let's keep the 40,000 dollars. - I know.

1029
00:36:37,145 --> 00:36:38,731
- Let's keep it. - Let's try for at least one hour.

1030
00:36:38,815 --> 00:36:42,053
I'm sure we're all full now, so don't order anymore.

1031
00:36:42,054 --> 00:36:44,452
- I smell something sweet. - What?

1032
00:36:44,453 --> 00:36:46,283
(She smells something sweet from Jae Seok's mouth.)

1033
00:36:46,284 --> 00:36:48,354
- I smell it. What did you have? - Do you know why?

1034
00:36:48,355 --> 00:36:49,723
He had something salty, so he needed some sugar.

1035
00:36:49,724 --> 00:36:51,210
Sweet and salty are the best combo.

1036
00:36:51,695 --> 00:36:52,823
(We caught you.)

1037
00:36:52,824 --> 00:36:54,434
- My goodness. - It smells like caramel, right?

1038
00:36:54,435 --> 00:36:55,677
It smells sweet.

1039
00:36:55,835 --> 00:36:58,064
(He's saved by the bell.)

1040
00:36:58,065 --> 00:36:59,434
We need to go.

1041
00:36:59,435 --> 00:37:00,702
(He runs towards his room.)

1042
00:37:00,703 --> 00:37:03,260
- He wants to spend more money. - I'm so mad.

1043
00:37:03,835 --> 00:37:06,732
Let's not spend anymore. We've spent enough.

1044
00:37:07,105 --> 00:37:08,113
(They return to their rooms.)

1045
00:37:08,114 --> 00:37:09,327
I was such a fool.

1046
00:37:10,215 --> 00:37:13,414
My room was the humblest.

1047
00:37:13,415 --> 00:37:15,452
Kwang Soo's room was paradise.

1048
00:37:15,453 --> 00:37:17,283
He had everything. He even had wet tissues.

1049
00:37:17,284 --> 00:37:20,485
I wanted to buy furniture but I didn't since it was too expensive.

1050
00:37:21,453 --> 00:37:23,273
They spent 40,000 dollars.

1051
00:37:24,565 --> 00:37:26,423
They all spent so much.

1052
00:37:26,424 --> 00:37:28,920
Kwang Soo is unbelievable.

1053
00:37:29,594 --> 00:37:31,734
(Here is the unbelievable Kwang Soo.)

1054
00:37:31,735 --> 00:37:34,158
I just bought rice from you.

1055
00:37:34,203 --> 00:37:36,533
Can you microwave this again?

1056
00:37:36,534 --> 00:37:38,292
(I just bought rice from you. Can you microwave this again?)

1057
00:37:38,505 --> 00:37:39,544
No.

1058
00:37:39,545 --> 00:37:40,616
(The man on the other end is curt.)

1059
00:37:42,174 --> 00:37:45,714
Look. I didn't even touch it.

1060
00:37:45,715 --> 00:37:48,178
It cooled down and hardened.

1061
00:37:48,755 --> 00:37:50,613
Can you microwave it for two minutes?

1062
00:37:50,614 --> 00:37:52,140
You need to order again.

1063
00:37:52,884 --> 00:37:53,952
How much is it?

1064
00:37:53,953 --> 00:37:56,176
You have to pay its original price.

1065
00:37:57,395 --> 00:38:00,051
(They're practically thieves.)

1066
00:38:01,665 --> 00:38:03,964
(In the end, he's left with...)

1067
00:38:03,965 --> 00:38:06,359
(the cold rice and soggy laver.)

1068
00:38:06,665 --> 00:38:08,553
(Chomp)

1069
00:38:09,203 --> 00:38:11,568
(It's not bad.)

1070
00:38:12,045 --> 00:38:15,513
(At the same time, Se Chan, who was eating the cold fried dumplings,)

1071
00:38:15,514 --> 00:38:17,394
(suddenly gets up.)

1072
00:38:18,045 --> 00:38:19,661
- Hello? - Yes?

1073
00:38:20,485 --> 00:38:21,727
Do you have ice cream?

1074
00:38:22,154 --> 00:38:23,295
A set of blankets...

1075
00:38:23,953 --> 00:38:25,297
One bag of chips...

1076
00:38:25,625 --> 00:38:26,796
A piece of fried chicken.

1077
00:38:27,384 --> 00:38:28,593
- One that's crispy on the outside, - Do you have jelly?

1078
00:38:28,594 --> 00:38:29,794
moist on the inside...

1079
00:38:29,795 --> 00:38:33,158
and hopefully warm drumstick.

1080
00:38:33,525 --> 00:38:35,150
And a glass of coke.

1081
00:38:36,094 --> 00:38:37,263
What's this?

1082
00:38:37,264 --> 00:38:39,464
(While everyone is busy spending money, Room 10...)

1083
00:38:39,465 --> 00:38:41,220
What's this? Why did Esom give this to me?

1084
00:38:42,935 --> 00:38:44,104
What does it say?

1085
00:38:44,105 --> 00:38:47,953
(Jae Seok received something from Esom, a mystery note!)

1086
00:38:48,415 --> 00:38:49,814
(During the prior open house.)

1087
00:38:49,815 --> 00:38:50,997
How do I give this to him?

1088
00:38:51,185 --> 00:38:52,314
Move back.

1089
00:38:52,315 --> 00:38:54,184
(Esom asked Jae Seok if he would like to drink some water.)

1090
00:38:54,185 --> 00:38:55,854
- Do you want some water? - Can you give me some?

1091
00:38:55,855 --> 00:38:56,914
- Sure. - Just a little bit.

1092
00:38:56,915 --> 00:39:01,440
(She secretly hands him the note with the water bottle.)

1093
00:39:02,025 --> 00:39:03,194
Would you like some juice?

1094
00:39:03,195 --> 00:39:04,394
(After spotting the mysterious note,)

1095
00:39:04,395 --> 00:39:05,694
(he just hid it in his pocket.)

1096
00:39:05,695 --> 00:39:06,705
The water...

1097
00:39:07,895 --> 00:39:09,713
What's this? Why did Esom give this to me?

1098
00:39:10,835 --> 00:39:12,104
What does it say?

1099
00:39:12,105 --> 00:39:14,274
(Why did Esom give it to him? What is it about?)

1100
00:39:14,275 --> 00:39:16,222
What? "You are Yuims Bond"?

1101
00:39:17,404 --> 00:39:19,173
"There is a spy who is after you."

1102
00:39:19,174 --> 00:39:20,673
("You are Yuims Bond. There is a spy who is after you.")

1103
00:39:20,674 --> 00:39:23,013
(I'm Yuims Bond?)

1104
00:39:23,014 --> 00:39:26,217
(And there's a spy after me?)

1105
00:39:27,185 --> 00:39:30,588
Yuims Bond must have read the note by now.

1106
00:39:31,625 --> 00:39:33,301
"You must find and eliminate the spy."

1107
00:39:33,884 --> 00:39:35,036
"I..."

1108
00:39:36,295 --> 00:39:38,617
I must make him trust me.

1109
00:39:39,165 --> 00:39:40,306
Please...

1110
00:39:41,364 --> 00:39:42,546
"I am..."

1111
00:39:43,165 --> 00:39:44,533
"the Bond Girl."

1112
00:39:44,534 --> 00:39:46,363
("I am the Bond Girl.")

1113
00:39:46,364 --> 00:39:49,803
- I'm Yuims Bond? - I need to protect him.

1114
00:39:49,804 --> 00:39:51,864
(Esom says she's the Bond Girl. There's a secret to this calm race.)

1115
00:39:52,904 --> 00:39:54,644
Hello, I'm Esom.

1116
00:39:54,645 --> 00:39:55,684
(This morning, before the Inseparable Money Race,)

1117
00:39:56,815 --> 00:39:57,944
Hello.

1118
00:39:57,945 --> 00:39:59,314
(Esom secretly arrives before the other members.)

1119
00:39:59,315 --> 00:40:02,385
Today, we are playing the Inseparable Money Race.

1120
00:40:02,585 --> 00:40:04,084
However, you will be given a special duty...

1121
00:40:04,085 --> 00:40:07,255
- along with the race. - Yes.

1122
00:40:07,324 --> 00:40:08,923
You are Yuims Bond's assistant,

1123
00:40:08,924 --> 00:40:10,653
the Bond Girl.

1124
00:40:10,654 --> 00:40:13,323
(Esom's special duty is Yuims Bond's assistant, the Bond Girl.)

1125
00:40:13,324 --> 00:40:14,493
- Me? - Yes?

1126
00:40:14,494 --> 00:40:15,645
Will I be all right?

1127
00:40:16,395 --> 00:40:17,633
As the Bond Girl,

1128
00:40:17,634 --> 00:40:19,664
you have to carry out hidden missions with Jae Seok,

1129
00:40:19,665 --> 00:40:21,624
who is Yuims Bond.

1130
00:40:21,835 --> 00:40:23,774
However,

1131
00:40:23,775 --> 00:40:27,855
Yuims Bond hasn't done any undercover work in four years,

1132
00:40:27,974 --> 00:40:31,722
so he doesn't know his identity yet.

1133
00:40:32,244 --> 00:40:36,396
You have to pass this on to him without the spy finding out,

1134
00:40:36,784 --> 00:40:39,854
find the spy, and eliminate them before Jae Seok gets tagged out...

1135
00:40:39,855 --> 00:40:41,794
(Pass the news and tag the spy out before Jae Seok gets tagged out!)

1136
00:40:41,795 --> 00:40:43,238
in order to win.

1137
00:40:43,625 --> 00:40:44,723
I understand.

1138
00:40:44,724 --> 00:40:47,794
(I will bring back Yuims Bond!)

1139
00:40:47,795 --> 00:40:48,964
Hello?

1140
00:40:48,965 --> 00:40:49,993
(First, buy a pen and paper while everyone else buys food.)

1141
00:40:49,994 --> 00:40:52,792
Do you have a pen and paper?

1142
00:40:53,864 --> 00:40:59,256
(Second, write on chopsticks wrapper to keep the note confidential.)

1143
00:40:59,375 --> 00:41:03,354
I bought juice and water to approach Yuims Bond.

1144
00:41:03,514 --> 00:41:05,144
I need to gain his trust.

1145
00:41:05,145 --> 00:41:07,044
(The Bond Girl carries out an elaborate strategy...)

1146
00:41:07,045 --> 00:41:08,833
(in order to inform Yuims Bond of his comeback.)

1147
00:41:08,855 --> 00:41:10,469
"There is a spy who is after you."

1148
00:41:10,485 --> 00:41:12,040
"You must find and eliminate the spy."

1149
00:41:12,284 --> 00:41:14,516
"I am the Bond Girl."

1150
00:41:16,395 --> 00:41:17,493
Yuims Bond?

1151
00:41:17,494 --> 00:41:19,514
(I'm Yuims Bond?)

1152
00:41:19,864 --> 00:41:22,633
(Though his weapon may be weak, his power stands strong.)

1153
00:41:22,634 --> 00:41:24,763
(The ruler of water guns, Yuims Bond.)

1154
00:41:24,764 --> 00:41:27,874
(One shot and one kill with his water gun,)

1155
00:41:27,875 --> 00:41:30,259
(he has finally returned.)

1156
00:41:31,005 --> 00:41:32,644
It has been a long time.

1157
00:41:32,645 --> 00:41:34,736
(It is all of the sudden though.)

1158
00:41:35,074 --> 00:41:38,644
(Let me hear what you've got for me.)

1159
00:41:38,645 --> 00:41:40,129
("Babam!" Someone might hear me.)

1160
00:41:40,715 --> 00:41:43,952
(Shall I head out for some water gun shooting?)

1161
00:41:43,953 --> 00:41:45,096
Bang!

1162
00:41:48,395 --> 00:41:50,616
I see the time has come. It's me, Yuims Bond.

1163
00:41:50,953 --> 00:41:52,944
What do you mean there's a spy after me?

1164
00:41:53,295 --> 00:41:56,799
This is the store. What are you talking about?

1165
00:41:57,494 --> 00:41:59,334
Gosh, this is driving me crazy.

1166
00:41:59,335 --> 00:42:00,464
(They won't give me my water gun and there's nowhere else to ask...)

1167
00:42:00,465 --> 00:42:01,903
I don't know what's going on,

1168
00:42:01,904 --> 00:42:03,533
but I got a note and it said I'm Yuims Bond.

1169
00:42:03,534 --> 00:42:05,261
What am I supposed to do without a water gun?

1170
00:42:05,844 --> 00:42:07,864
Please purchase whatever you need.

1171
00:42:08,244 --> 00:42:11,517
Then send me the gadgets I'll need for my espionage.

1172
00:42:11,685 --> 00:42:13,260
A water gun, of course, and a car.

1173
00:42:14,145 --> 00:42:15,731
Car keys, a suit,

1174
00:42:16,415 --> 00:42:19,889
and everything else. Please have them sent to me.

1175
00:42:20,324 --> 00:42:22,344
- How much is it? - 5,000 dollars for the water gun.

1176
00:42:23,224 --> 00:42:24,964
- Yes. - The car...

1177
00:42:24,965 --> 00:42:26,076
is 500 billion dollars,

1178
00:42:26,165 --> 00:42:28,113
and the suit is 10 billion dollars.

1179
00:42:29,935 --> 00:42:31,504
I'm sorry, but are you out of your mind?

1180
00:42:31,505 --> 00:42:32,949
(The prices are unbelievable.)

1181
00:42:33,465 --> 00:42:35,133
Send me the water gun, then.

1182
00:42:35,134 --> 00:42:37,104
(The clueless Yuims Bond reaches an agreement...)

1183
00:42:37,105 --> 00:42:39,366
(and buys just the 5,000 dollar water gun.)

1184
00:42:41,045 --> 00:42:42,761
It's going to show through this.

1185
00:42:43,445 --> 00:42:44,757
The water gun's going to show.

1186
00:42:45,244 --> 00:42:47,365
First of all, I was so scared...

1187
00:42:47,384 --> 00:42:49,414
that they might come see my room.

1188
00:42:49,415 --> 00:42:51,923
Since I have this pen.

1189
00:42:51,924 --> 00:42:52,934
(They mustn't see my pen...)

1190
00:42:53,824 --> 00:42:56,124
(Just then,)

1191
00:42:56,125 --> 00:42:57,294
Thank you.

1192
00:42:57,295 --> 00:42:58,394
(Yuims Bond water gun arrives.)

1193
00:42:58,395 --> 00:42:59,394
Thank you.

1194
00:42:59,395 --> 00:43:02,263
(Seeing it in a long time, it's bigger than he thought.)

1195
00:43:02,735 --> 00:43:06,133
(Let me try it out...)

1196
00:43:06,134 --> 00:43:07,234
(It's empty!)

1197
00:43:07,235 --> 00:43:08,374
The water...

1198
00:43:08,375 --> 00:43:10,091
(It's empty!)

1199
00:43:10,235 --> 00:43:11,285
Hello?

1200
00:43:11,344 --> 00:43:12,403
It's empty!

1201
00:43:12,404 --> 00:43:14,465
The special solution is 5,000 dollars.

1202
00:43:14,744 --> 00:43:16,633
Gosh.

1203
00:43:17,344 --> 00:43:18,843
Please send it quickly.

1204
00:43:18,844 --> 00:43:20,343
(Although he feels ripped-off, he buys the solution.)

1205
00:43:20,344 --> 00:43:21,394
How much was it?

1206
00:43:22,884 --> 00:43:26,723
(The 5,000 dollar special solution arrives.)

1207
00:43:26,724 --> 00:43:29,053
(But it's bigger than he expected.)

1208
00:43:29,054 --> 00:43:30,124
All right.

1209
00:43:30,125 --> 00:43:31,823
(He has a water gun and a huge bottle of solution.)

1210
00:43:31,824 --> 00:43:34,064
I'm going to get caught for sure, if I have that bottle in here.

1211
00:43:34,065 --> 00:43:35,650
(He must hide it carefully in order to hide from the spy.)

1212
00:43:36,395 --> 00:43:38,334
It says "water gun" here...

1213
00:43:38,335 --> 00:43:39,446
(It says "water gun" here...)

1214
00:43:39,804 --> 00:43:41,004
I'll erase it.

1215
00:43:41,005 --> 00:43:42,403
(While Yuims Bond and the Bond Girl focus on hiding their identity,)

1216
00:43:42,404 --> 00:43:44,104
(the siren goes off.)

1217
00:43:44,105 --> 00:43:45,287
Oh no.

1218
00:43:45,474 --> 00:43:49,757
(It's the third open house, so she hides it under the food tray.)

1219
00:43:50,145 --> 00:43:52,644
(Their identities will get caught if their rooms are open to the others.)

1220
00:43:52,645 --> 00:43:55,481
(What will happen to the Bond Girl and Yuims Bond?)

1221
00:43:55,915 --> 00:43:57,053
(3rd open house)

1222
00:43:57,054 --> 00:43:58,254
I hope no one ordered anything.

1223
00:43:58,255 --> 00:43:59,538
Please!

1224
00:44:00,224 --> 00:44:01,265
Come on!

1225
00:44:01,355 --> 00:44:02,435
This is...

1226
00:44:02,695 --> 00:44:05,350
(How much will they have left this time?)

1227
00:44:06,424 --> 00:44:07,493
Someone spent money again?

1228
00:44:07,494 --> 00:44:08,894
(They promised not to use it.)

1229
00:44:08,895 --> 00:44:09,945
How much does it read?

1230
00:44:10,295 --> 00:44:11,647
Is there even anything left to buy?

1231
00:44:12,165 --> 00:44:13,604
Why can't you save it?

1232
00:44:13,605 --> 00:44:15,073
There really wasn't anything left to buy.

1233
00:44:15,074 --> 00:44:17,303
- I even took a nap. - Really?

1234
00:44:17,304 --> 00:44:19,222
You all ate already!

1235
00:44:19,844 --> 00:44:22,168
I didn't have anything to do, either.

1236
00:44:22,474 --> 00:44:24,613
(Congratulations on your comeback.)

1237
00:44:24,614 --> 00:44:26,544
- I was too full to eat anything. - What...

1238
00:44:26,545 --> 00:44:28,214
(Someone else must have bought something for their room, too.)

1239
00:44:28,215 --> 00:44:30,678
- Who used the 80,000 dollars? - Who was it?

1240
00:44:30,855 --> 00:44:32,383
Then let's decide with a game.

1241
00:44:32,384 --> 00:44:33,624
- Since we have the line drawn. - Yes.

1242
00:44:33,625 --> 00:44:35,723
First place gets to choose which room to see.

1243
00:44:35,724 --> 00:44:36,854
- Okay. - Okay.

1244
00:44:36,855 --> 00:44:38,481
- Just first place? - Good.

1245
00:44:38,994 --> 00:44:41,559
Whoever throws their shoe closest to the inner line.

1246
00:44:41,665 --> 00:44:43,033
- If it goes over, you're out. - If it goes over, you're out?

1247
00:44:43,034 --> 00:44:44,509
- If it goes over? - You're out if it goes over.

1248
00:44:44,804 --> 00:44:45,934
You're out if it goes past the line.

1249
00:44:45,935 --> 00:44:47,033
- All right. - Yes.

1250
00:44:47,034 --> 00:44:48,033
(She slides next to Yuims Bond.)

1251
00:44:48,034 --> 00:44:50,700
- First place chooses a room. - Of course.

1252
00:44:51,134 --> 00:44:52,303
Shoot!

1253
00:44:52,304 --> 00:44:53,774
(Seok Jin's try.)

1254
00:44:53,775 --> 00:44:55,462
(It's quite close to the line!)

1255
00:44:55,875 --> 00:44:56,973
- That was good. - Next!

1256
00:44:56,974 --> 00:44:58,056
(Seok Jin is quite good!)

1257
00:44:58,685 --> 00:45:00,383
I'm going to win.

1258
00:45:00,384 --> 00:45:01,584
(The next player, Kwang Soo, is currently winning.)

1259
00:45:01,585 --> 00:45:02,653
It's a tie.

1260
00:45:02,654 --> 00:45:04,883
(Kyung Nam tries after Ji Hyo.)

1261
00:45:04,884 --> 00:45:06,066
- It went past! - Wow.

1262
00:45:06,685 --> 00:45:07,723
He's winning.

1263
00:45:07,724 --> 00:45:09,024
(They're all good.)

1264
00:45:09,025 --> 00:45:10,223
Next is Esom.

1265
00:45:10,224 --> 00:45:12,093
(While everyone shows off their unexpected talent,)

1266
00:45:12,094 --> 00:45:14,394
(the Bond Girl Esom tries next.)

1267
00:45:14,395 --> 00:45:16,734
(If either Esom or Jae Seok doesn't win,)

1268
00:45:16,735 --> 00:45:19,133
(their rooms may be revealed!)

1269
00:45:19,134 --> 00:45:21,185
- It's out. - Out!

1270
00:45:22,375 --> 00:45:24,104
(A clear out.)

1271
00:45:24,105 --> 00:45:25,944
- It's a home run! - I'll go next.

1272
00:45:25,945 --> 00:45:27,016
- Out. - It's the first out.

1273
00:45:27,105 --> 00:45:28,774
That's so disappointing.

1274
00:45:28,775 --> 00:45:29,944
Next, Se Chan.

1275
00:45:29,945 --> 00:45:32,408
(Next is Se Chan.)

1276
00:45:34,384 --> 00:45:35,754
(It landed in the line, but the shoelace is sticking out!)

1277
00:45:35,755 --> 00:45:37,502
- What happened? - Isn't this okay?

1278
00:45:37,815 --> 00:45:39,184
- Why? - It's okay.

1279
00:45:39,185 --> 00:45:40,739
- The shoelace. - Out!

1280
00:45:40,953 --> 00:45:42,610
- You won't accept this? - Out!

1281
00:45:43,154 --> 00:45:45,185
- It's out. - The shoelace is sticking out.

1282
00:45:45,324 --> 00:45:46,374
It's my turn!

1283
00:45:47,264 --> 00:45:48,294
Move over!

1284
00:45:48,295 --> 00:45:49,863
(With the Bond Girl out, Yuims Bond is facing a crisis!)

1285
00:45:49,864 --> 00:45:52,334
(Jae Seok has to win,)

1286
00:45:52,335 --> 00:45:54,874
(in order to protect the room with the water gun!)

1287
00:45:54,875 --> 00:45:58,137
(Please...)

1288
00:45:59,744 --> 00:46:00,803
(It flew and landed on the line!)

1289
00:46:00,804 --> 00:46:01,814
What?

1290
00:46:01,815 --> 00:46:02,854
(It flew and landed on the line!)

1291
00:46:03,174 --> 00:46:05,003
(A perfect winner)

1292
00:46:05,744 --> 00:46:06,927
This is...

1293
00:46:07,614 --> 00:46:08,827
This is unbelievable.

1294
00:46:09,685 --> 00:46:10,883
That is amazing.

1295
00:46:10,884 --> 00:46:12,524
(Yuims Bond got the hang of it and they'll reveal the room he chooses!)

1296
00:46:12,525 --> 00:46:14,124
- I choose Kyung Nam's room. - Go ahead and see.

1297
00:46:14,125 --> 00:46:17,023
(Let's go see Kyung Nam's room!)

1298
00:46:17,025 --> 00:46:18,882
- It's Room One. - This way.

1299
00:46:19,025 --> 00:46:21,186
- There's nothing in there. - I doubt there will be anything.

1300
00:46:21,335 --> 00:46:22,334
Let's see your room, Kyung Nam.

1301
00:46:22,335 --> 00:46:24,903
(There really isn't anything in his room.)

1302
00:46:24,904 --> 00:46:26,604
Nothing. My room is spotless.

1303
00:46:26,605 --> 00:46:27,676
- I'm... - It's empty.

1304
00:46:27,735 --> 00:46:28,834
really...

1305
00:46:28,835 --> 00:46:29,985
- What? - It's true!

1306
00:46:30,074 --> 00:46:31,903
- You didn't buy anything? - You didn't eat anything?

1307
00:46:31,904 --> 00:46:34,774
I never used the intercom. Look.

1308
00:46:34,775 --> 00:46:36,159
The intercom fell on the floor.

1309
00:46:36,514 --> 00:46:38,383
He really didn't buy anything.

1310
00:46:38,384 --> 00:46:40,484
I didn't even eat anything.

1311
00:46:40,485 --> 00:46:41,625
He really didn't buy anything.

1312
00:46:41,755 --> 00:46:43,432
It doesn't smell.

1313
00:46:43,585 --> 00:46:45,952
Then where did all the money go?

1314
00:46:45,953 --> 00:46:48,394
- Who did it? - Who spent the 80,000 dollars?

1315
00:46:48,395 --> 00:46:50,993
Kyung Nam really didn't do anything.

1316
00:46:50,994 --> 00:46:52,223
I told you...

1317
00:46:52,224 --> 00:46:53,624
Are you sure you didn't eat the wrappers as well?

1318
00:46:53,625 --> 00:46:55,234
- The wrappers? - Just in case.

1319
00:46:55,235 --> 00:46:58,104
- Kyung Nam is very honest. - He's prudent.

1320
00:46:58,105 --> 00:46:59,504
I've concluded that...

1321
00:46:59,505 --> 00:47:00,564
you don't suit variety shows.

1322
00:47:00,565 --> 00:47:02,274
(You don't suit variety shows.)

1323
00:47:02,275 --> 00:47:03,504
(Yuims Bond makes a harsh comment.)

1324
00:47:03,505 --> 00:47:05,473
- You don't... - Why are you talking like that?

1325
00:47:05,474 --> 00:47:07,104
- He doesn't fit in. - It's his first time here.

1326
00:47:07,105 --> 00:47:08,388
You don't fit here.

1327
00:47:08,645 --> 00:47:10,343
- It's his first time here. - You don't fit here.

1328
00:47:10,344 --> 00:47:11,613
(The harsh comment makes him look back on today...)

1329
00:47:11,614 --> 00:47:13,044
(where he didn't even use the toilet in order to follow the rules.)

1330
00:47:13,045 --> 00:47:14,156
Okay.

1331
00:47:14,585 --> 00:47:15,897
- Come on. - Okay.

1332
00:47:16,185 --> 00:47:18,053
- Let's go back in. - Please hold it in.

1333
00:47:18,054 --> 00:47:20,124
We need the money.

1334
00:47:20,125 --> 00:47:22,524
There's nothing to do.

1335
00:47:22,525 --> 00:47:24,053
(Everyone has entered their cells.)

1336
00:47:24,054 --> 00:47:25,781
Seeing that Jae Seok kept...

1337
00:47:26,625 --> 00:47:28,553
insisting on seeing...

1338
00:47:28,895 --> 00:47:30,394
Kyung Nam's room,

1339
00:47:30,395 --> 00:47:32,863
(Seeing that Yuims Bond insisted on seeing Kyun Nam's room...)

1340
00:47:32,864 --> 00:47:34,133
I think he's suspecting Kyung Nam.

1341
00:47:34,134 --> 00:47:35,791
(I think he's suspecting Kyung Nam as the spy.)

1342
00:47:36,574 --> 00:47:38,898
I don't think the money is the main part of this game.

1343
00:47:39,605 --> 00:47:42,200
Jae Seok is quiet, too.

1344
00:47:43,674 --> 00:47:48,462
(The silent Yuims Bond is getting his water gun ready.)

1345
00:47:48,685 --> 00:47:51,584
(He cannot hide the huge bottle, so he gives it to Kwon Ryeol.)

1346
00:47:51,585 --> 00:47:52,783
Kwon Ryeol.

1347
00:47:52,784 --> 00:47:56,452
(He hides the big bottle by giving it to Kwon Ryeol.)

1348
00:47:56,453 --> 00:47:58,624
(4th open house)

1349
00:47:58,625 --> 00:47:59,735
What's happening?

1350
00:47:59,895 --> 00:48:01,379
Who was it?

1351
00:48:01,735 --> 00:48:03,263
Someone used it again.

1352
00:48:03,264 --> 00:48:04,547
Who was it?

1353
00:48:05,005 --> 00:48:06,923
It's really weird timing.

1354
00:48:07,634 --> 00:48:08,673
Where's Kyung Nam?

1355
00:48:08,674 --> 00:48:10,004
I bet he ate that cup noodles.

1356
00:48:10,005 --> 00:48:11,374
Kyung Nam, come on out!

1357
00:48:11,375 --> 00:48:13,444
- I think he ate it. - He ate it 100 percent.

1358
00:48:13,445 --> 00:48:16,071
- He couldn't wait. - I don't want it anymore.

1359
00:48:16,875 --> 00:48:18,013
- Kyung Nam! - What were you doing?

1360
00:48:18,014 --> 00:48:19,459
- You're late. - I fell asleep.

1361
00:48:19,685 --> 00:48:20,743
I fell asleep.

1362
00:48:20,744 --> 00:48:22,053
Did you eat the cup noodles?

1363
00:48:22,054 --> 00:48:23,383
- No, I fell asleep. - I think he did sleep.

1364
00:48:23,384 --> 00:48:25,524
There's something on his hair.

1365
00:48:25,525 --> 00:48:26,883
He did fall asleep.

1366
00:48:26,884 --> 00:48:28,254
- He slept? - Yes.

1367
00:48:28,255 --> 00:48:30,072
How do you fall asleep? Was there even a blanket?

1368
00:48:30,395 --> 00:48:32,647
You have about three hours left.

1369
00:48:33,864 --> 00:48:35,493
There's really nothing to do...

1370
00:48:35,494 --> 00:48:37,263
- in there. - Right.

1371
00:48:37,264 --> 00:48:38,779
- Totally. - You're right.

1372
00:48:38,864 --> 00:48:41,303
- I had no one to talk to. - Right.

1373
00:48:41,304 --> 00:48:42,434
I couldn't talk to anyone.

1374
00:48:42,435 --> 00:48:47,019
(Yuims Bond and the Bond Girl have a more important mission.)

1375
00:48:47,404 --> 00:48:48,687
Who could be the spy?

1376
00:48:49,915 --> 00:48:51,460
We're just taking a break!

1377
00:48:51,744 --> 00:48:53,243
We're letting you pass this time.

1378
00:48:53,244 --> 00:48:54,814
(It could seem like everyone is trying to save the money.)

1379
00:48:54,815 --> 00:48:56,804
I'm coming to get you!

1380
00:48:57,554 --> 00:48:59,283
What are you eating this time?

1381
00:48:59,284 --> 00:49:00,334
(It could seem like everyone is trying to save the money.)

1382
00:49:00,724 --> 00:49:02,572
I can't figure out who the spy is.

1383
00:49:03,824 --> 00:49:05,612
This is how people go crazy...

1384
00:49:05,924 --> 00:49:07,137
after being locked up in here.

1385
00:49:08,235 --> 00:49:10,012
How are we supposed to find the spy?

1386
00:49:11,094 --> 00:49:13,633
Are we allowed to take the prize or what?

1387
00:49:13,634 --> 00:49:16,834
(Someone is definitely a spy among these 8 people.)

1388
00:49:16,835 --> 00:49:18,743
Would it be unfavorable...

1389
00:49:18,744 --> 00:49:20,159
to someone who spends too much?

1390
00:49:21,005 --> 00:49:22,714
I have a job to do!

1391
00:49:22,715 --> 00:49:24,796
I have no clue.

1392
00:49:25,815 --> 00:49:27,484
What is this?

1393
00:49:27,485 --> 00:49:28,584
Good.

1394
00:49:28,585 --> 00:49:30,452
- It didn't change. - It didn't change.

1395
00:49:30,453 --> 00:49:31,838
- No one spent it. - No one spent it.

1396
00:49:32,054 --> 00:49:33,723
Good, good.

1397
00:49:33,724 --> 00:49:36,323
It has passed nine hours, everyone.

1398
00:49:36,324 --> 00:49:37,566
(9 hours of solitary confinement is finished.)

1399
00:49:38,494 --> 00:49:40,524
Somehow there's still some left.

1400
00:49:40,525 --> 00:49:41,544
Very good.

1401
00:49:41,935 --> 00:49:44,334
Now, 19,300 dollars will be divided...

1402
00:49:44,335 --> 00:49:46,527
into each and every one of you.

1403
00:49:47,034 --> 00:49:48,418
- That's 1,930 dollars each. - Okay.

1404
00:49:49,105 --> 00:49:50,548
Let's go shopping.

1405
00:49:50,574 --> 00:49:53,073
The final mission for you to achieve the individual prize...

1406
00:49:53,074 --> 00:49:55,374
is "Money Race".

1407
00:49:55,375 --> 00:49:56,444
Money Race?

1408
00:49:56,445 --> 00:50:00,243
Hidden inside this building are 10 individual vaults...

1409
00:50:00,244 --> 00:50:05,283
with your prize, 1,930 dollars, inside them.

1410
00:50:05,284 --> 00:50:06,323
(10 vaults hold 1,930 dollars in each one.)

1411
00:50:06,324 --> 00:50:08,516
And there's also the vault of Host S...

1412
00:50:08,895 --> 00:50:11,652
with the total prize, 19,300 dollars inside it.

1413
00:50:11,764 --> 00:50:13,763
It has the total prize in it.

1414
00:50:13,764 --> 00:50:17,371
After you earn your individual prize...

1415
00:50:17,634 --> 00:50:20,159
by opening a vault with your name tag on it,

1416
00:50:20,264 --> 00:50:22,324
if you find the vault of Host S,

1417
00:50:22,435 --> 00:50:24,555
you will be given the total prize.

1418
00:50:24,974 --> 00:50:26,544
- That's a lot of money. - And that's it?

1419
00:50:26,545 --> 00:50:28,004
It's over when I find mine, then the host's?

1420
00:50:28,005 --> 00:50:29,243
- Correct. - That's amazing.

1421
00:50:29,244 --> 00:50:31,644
Head to your own starting points,

1422
00:50:31,645 --> 00:50:32,883
- and start the race. - Come on!

1423
00:50:32,884 --> 00:50:35,107
- Okay! - Let's go win 19,300 dollars.

1424
00:50:35,315 --> 00:50:36,754
You know you're not going to win.

1425
00:50:36,755 --> 00:50:38,653
- I'm going to win. - How can you do that?

1426
00:50:38,654 --> 00:50:39,867
- I'm going to win. - Let's go...

1427
00:50:39,924 --> 00:50:41,611
find my vault!

1428
00:50:42,224 --> 00:50:44,951
(Money Race has begun.)

1429
00:50:45,395 --> 00:50:47,423
I need to find the vault.

1430
00:50:47,424 --> 00:50:48,863
(You need to find your vault first!)

1431
00:50:48,864 --> 00:50:50,434
I'm motivated today.

1432
00:50:50,435 --> 00:50:51,434
(Where's my vault?)

1433
00:50:51,435 --> 00:50:52,617
I'm in a rush.

1434
00:50:53,703 --> 00:50:55,234
(While everyone is looking for their vaults,)

1435
00:50:55,235 --> 00:50:56,346
Where's...

1436
00:50:57,034 --> 00:50:58,644
(Yuims Bond and the Bond Girl...)

1437
00:50:58,645 --> 00:51:01,274
(try to secretly meet.)

1438
00:51:01,275 --> 00:51:02,860
- Why did you give me the note? - What?

1439
00:51:03,074 --> 00:51:04,513
Why did you give me the note?

1440
00:51:04,514 --> 00:51:06,283
- You didn't read it? - I read it.

1441
00:51:06,284 --> 00:51:08,266
(Will they able to catch the spy and accomplish the mission?)

1442
00:51:08,275 --> 00:51:09,161
What?

1443
00:51:09,174 --> 00:51:10,613
Why did you give me the note?

1444
00:51:10,614 --> 00:51:12,402
- You didn't read it? - I read it.

1445
00:51:12,426 --> 00:51:14,009
(Jae Seok & Esom finally have a proper conversation.)

1446
00:51:14,010 --> 00:51:15,109
(He checked the note.)

1447
00:51:15,110 --> 00:51:16,809
- I know I'm Yuims Bond. - Yes.

1448
00:51:16,810 --> 00:51:17,809
(I know I'm Yuims Bond.)

1449
00:51:17,810 --> 00:51:20,031
So, who's the spy?

1450
00:51:20,349 --> 00:51:22,137
We're supposed to figure that out.

1451
00:51:22,449 --> 00:51:24,036
- You don't know who it is? - No.

1452
00:51:24,420 --> 00:51:26,844
So what are we supposed to do with the water gun?

1453
00:51:27,449 --> 00:51:28,689
Do we fire it on the back to eliminate them?

1454
00:51:28,690 --> 00:51:31,184
Here is your mission.

1455
00:51:31,489 --> 00:51:35,944
When the members find each vault with the individual prize in it,

1456
00:51:36,029 --> 00:51:37,729
they're infected by money poison.

1457
00:51:37,730 --> 00:51:39,042
"Money Poison"?

1458
00:51:39,199 --> 00:51:41,724
When they're infected by it,

1459
00:51:41,840 --> 00:51:44,539
they must be shot with Yuims Bond's water gun vaccine.

1460
00:51:44,540 --> 00:51:47,498
Otherwise, they will be eliminated.

1461
00:51:47,639 --> 00:51:51,548
So we're here to save our members?

1462
00:51:51,549 --> 00:51:53,479
(Yuims Bond's job is to save them, not eliminate them.)

1463
00:51:53,480 --> 00:51:56,954
When one member is eliminated due to the infection,

1464
00:51:57,078 --> 00:51:59,718
or Yuims Bond is eliminated by the spy,

1465
00:51:59,719 --> 00:52:01,459
the race is over.

1466
00:52:01,460 --> 00:52:04,089
But we don't know who it is.

1467
00:52:04,090 --> 00:52:07,766
When a member finds his or her vault, it will be announced.

1468
00:52:07,900 --> 00:52:09,949
Also, the vaccinated member will be...

1469
00:52:10,259 --> 00:52:13,327
taken by the guards to be isolated in the infirmary...

1470
00:52:13,328 --> 00:52:15,319
- until the race is finished. - Okay.

1471
00:52:15,500 --> 00:52:19,039
But the spy is immune to the money poison,

1472
00:52:19,040 --> 00:52:20,928
therefore they will not be isolated.

1473
00:52:21,139 --> 00:52:22,138
And?

1474
00:52:22,139 --> 00:52:25,008
Yuims Bond must fire the water gun...

1475
00:52:25,009 --> 00:52:27,949
at the spy's face when you find out who it is.

1476
00:52:28,320 --> 00:52:29,879
And the Bond Girl's job...

1477
00:52:29,880 --> 00:52:32,149
is to help Yuims Bond save the members...

1478
00:52:32,150 --> 00:52:33,948
without being suspected,

1479
00:52:33,949 --> 00:52:37,051
and to find and eliminate the spy.

1480
00:52:37,719 --> 00:52:39,327
You have a critical role.

1481
00:52:39,328 --> 00:52:40,459
(Mission comprehended.)

1482
00:52:40,460 --> 00:52:42,620
It sounds difficult. It's complicated.

1483
00:52:42,828 --> 00:52:45,028
(Money Poison will be coming soon.)

1484
00:52:45,029 --> 00:52:47,598
What does that vault look like?

1485
00:52:47,599 --> 00:52:49,014
(The members are only focused on finding the vault.)

1486
00:52:49,670 --> 00:52:50,912
I found something!

1487
00:52:51,310 --> 00:52:53,694
(Did he find a vault?)

1488
00:52:53,909 --> 00:52:55,051
I found something!

1489
00:52:55,179 --> 00:52:56,352
- Right? - Wait!

1490
00:52:56,739 --> 00:52:57,891
Whose is it?

1491
00:52:59,009 --> 00:53:00,666
- It was nothing. - What?

1492
00:53:02,049 --> 00:53:03,118
(What Haha found was...)

1493
00:53:03,119 --> 00:53:04,519
It's garbage!

1494
00:53:04,520 --> 00:53:05,833
It was nothing.

1495
00:53:06,119 --> 00:53:07,488
(That's garbage, Haha.)

1496
00:53:07,489 --> 00:53:08,833
Come on.

1497
00:53:09,759 --> 00:53:10,932
I'm sorry.

1498
00:53:11,328 --> 00:53:12,945
This is embarrassing.

1499
00:53:13,690 --> 00:53:14,770
I thought...

1500
00:53:15,130 --> 00:53:17,019
I found it.

1501
00:53:18,199 --> 00:53:21,057
Let's find out where it is.

1502
00:53:22,400 --> 00:53:23,569
(There's something!)

1503
00:53:23,570 --> 00:53:24,620
I found it.

1504
00:53:25,210 --> 00:53:26,939
(He found a vault under the desk.)

1505
00:53:26,940 --> 00:53:28,051
It's mine.

1506
00:53:28,578 --> 00:53:30,209
(The vault belongs to...)

1507
00:53:30,210 --> 00:53:32,027
(Se Chan!)

1508
00:53:32,880 --> 00:53:35,173
(The password of each vault is their dates of birth.)

1509
00:53:36,549 --> 00:53:37,661
It worked.

1510
00:53:38,719 --> 00:53:40,388
(10 minutes remaining for him to be vaccinated.)

1511
00:53:40,389 --> 00:53:42,136
Yang Se Chan...

1512
00:53:42,619 --> 00:53:44,539
has found his vault.

1513
00:53:45,190 --> 00:53:48,594
(Now he needs to find the vault of Host S!)

1514
00:53:49,429 --> 00:53:50,959
(Yuims Bond heard the announcement.)

1515
00:53:50,960 --> 00:53:52,327
- This is terrible. - Where are you going?

1516
00:53:52,328 --> 00:53:53,798
- What's terrible? - I have to go.

1517
00:53:53,799 --> 00:53:54,999
What's terrible? Where are you going?

1518
00:53:55,000 --> 00:53:56,039
(He must find Se Chan in 10 minutes to fire a shot on his name tag.)

1519
00:53:56,040 --> 00:53:57,483
- Where are you going? - This is bad.

1520
00:53:57,909 --> 00:53:58,919
Se Chan found it?

1521
00:53:59,110 --> 00:54:00,483
I have to find him.

1522
00:54:01,279 --> 00:54:02,320
This is terrible.

1523
00:54:02,540 --> 00:54:04,296
I have to vaccinate him.

1524
00:54:05,449 --> 00:54:06,622
Where is he?

1525
00:54:07,310 --> 00:54:09,149
(If Se Chan is not vaccinated in 10 minutes, the race is over.)

1526
00:54:09,150 --> 00:54:10,392
It's so hot.

1527
00:54:10,719 --> 00:54:12,365
(And at that moment,)

1528
00:54:12,449 --> 00:54:14,308
(she found Se Chan!)

1529
00:54:14,920 --> 00:54:16,171
Did you find it?

1530
00:54:16,560 --> 00:54:17,833
Not yet.

1531
00:54:18,529 --> 00:54:20,028
But they announced it!

1532
00:54:20,029 --> 00:54:21,089
(We just announced that he found the vault.)

1533
00:54:21,090 --> 00:54:22,129
You heard that?

1534
00:54:22,130 --> 00:54:23,499
- I did. - Yes, I found it.

1535
00:54:23,500 --> 00:54:24,539
(After the 9-hour lockup, no one trusts anyone.)

1536
00:54:24,770 --> 00:54:26,446
(I have to tell Yuims Bond where he is.)

1537
00:54:27,130 --> 00:54:29,098
(Yuims Bond is also looking for Se Chan.)

1538
00:54:29,099 --> 00:54:30,138
There he is.

1539
00:54:30,139 --> 00:54:31,198
(Jae Seok has finally found Se Chan.)

1540
00:54:31,199 --> 00:54:33,764
(Se Chan is coming right towards Yuims Bond.)

1541
00:54:34,810 --> 00:54:38,416
(His water gun vaccine is locked and loaded.)

1542
00:54:40,078 --> 00:54:41,419
How did you find it?

1543
00:54:41,420 --> 00:54:42,778
In an out-of-the-way place.

1544
00:54:42,779 --> 00:54:44,164
That's amazing.

1545
00:54:44,578 --> 00:54:46,149
You're amazing.

1546
00:54:46,150 --> 00:54:47,919
(When Se Chan walks into a dead end,)

1547
00:54:47,920 --> 00:54:49,304
I have to find mine too.

1548
00:54:49,460 --> 00:54:53,297
(Jae Seok cautiously follows Se Chan.)

1549
00:54:53,659 --> 00:54:55,499
(He's being cautious since he doesn't know the spy.)

1550
00:54:55,500 --> 00:54:56,571
Hey.

1551
00:54:56,730 --> 00:54:57,941
How many are there?

1552
00:54:58,270 --> 00:54:59,598
I don't think he's here.

1553
00:54:59,599 --> 00:55:01,963
(Kyung Nam and the Bond Girl walk up together.)

1554
00:55:03,070 --> 00:55:04,413
- He's not here. - Let's see.

1555
00:55:05,009 --> 00:55:06,121
He's not here.

1556
00:55:06,340 --> 00:55:07,825
- Where have you looked? - I was...

1557
00:55:08,380 --> 00:55:09,778
on the fifth floor.

1558
00:55:09,779 --> 00:55:10,851
(I hope he succeeds.)

1559
00:55:11,210 --> 00:55:12,522
I looked around the fifth floor.

1560
00:55:14,610 --> 00:55:16,519
(He's left alone with Se Chan thanks to the Bond Girl.)

1561
00:55:16,520 --> 00:55:17,792
How many are there?

1562
00:55:18,790 --> 00:55:20,019
- There's only one? - Yes.

1563
00:55:20,020 --> 00:55:21,048
(It's time...)

1564
00:55:21,049 --> 00:55:24,523
(to vaccinate infected Se Chan.)

1565
00:55:24,790 --> 00:55:26,982
(The water gun vaccine is locked and loaded.)

1566
00:55:28,029 --> 00:55:29,598
(When Se Chan looks away,)

1567
00:55:29,599 --> 00:55:30,729
(he fires the vaccine!)

1568
00:55:30,730 --> 00:55:31,981
- You go first. - Thanks.

1569
00:55:32,429 --> 00:55:33,528
You go first.

1570
00:55:33,529 --> 00:55:37,741
(He successfully fires it at his name tag.)

1571
00:55:40,940 --> 00:55:43,439
(Se Chan doesn't even know he was vaccinated.)

1572
00:55:43,440 --> 00:55:44,723
Thank you.

1573
00:55:46,509 --> 00:55:48,297
You're going to thank me later.

1574
00:55:48,949 --> 00:55:50,464
I saved your life.

1575
00:55:51,049 --> 00:55:52,130
What?

1576
00:55:52,520 --> 00:55:53,630
What's going on?

1577
00:55:54,090 --> 00:55:55,258
I'm eliminated?

1578
00:55:55,259 --> 00:55:56,977
How? Why?

1579
00:55:57,119 --> 00:55:58,758
What's happening? I'm eliminated?

1580
00:55:58,759 --> 00:56:00,059
(He's going to the infirmary, not the prison.)

1581
00:56:00,060 --> 00:56:01,646
What did I do wrong?

1582
00:56:02,460 --> 00:56:03,698
Was my name tag ripped?

1583
00:56:03,699 --> 00:56:05,928
- This is the infirmary. - What?

1584
00:56:05,929 --> 00:56:07,788
You have been infected by Money Poison,

1585
00:56:08,639 --> 00:56:10,963
and now you will be given treatment here.

1586
00:56:11,369 --> 00:56:13,934
(What treatment?)

1587
00:56:14,409 --> 00:56:15,577
I'm infected by Money Poison?

1588
00:56:15,578 --> 00:56:17,023
(While Se Chan's Money Poison is being treated...)

1589
00:56:17,310 --> 00:56:18,623
Where could...

1590
00:56:19,078 --> 00:56:20,362
the vault be?

1591
00:56:20,779 --> 00:56:22,848
(Where is my vault?)

1592
00:56:22,849 --> 00:56:24,941
(He found a vault!)

1593
00:56:25,520 --> 00:56:27,618
(The vault he found belongs to...)

1594
00:56:27,619 --> 00:56:29,307
(Gosh, that surprised me!)

1595
00:56:30,259 --> 00:56:32,158
(The vault belongs to...)

1596
00:56:32,159 --> 00:56:34,109
(Lee Kwang Soo.)

1597
00:56:35,130 --> 00:56:37,499
(He punches in the password.)

1598
00:56:37,500 --> 00:56:39,999
Lee Kwang Soo has opened his vault.

1599
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:42,625
- Kwang Soo. - What was that?

1600
00:56:42,799 --> 00:56:44,456
- Was it Kwang Soo? - He found his vault.

1601
00:56:45,110 --> 00:56:46,322
- Did you find your vault? - Yes.

1602
00:56:47,409 --> 00:56:50,743
I am going to do this.

1603
00:56:51,139 --> 00:56:52,379
You...

1604
00:56:52,380 --> 00:56:54,379
(Kwang Soo, here comes Yuims Bond!)

1605
00:56:54,380 --> 00:56:55,618
I am going to do this today.

1606
00:56:55,619 --> 00:56:56,919
Kwang Soo, did you find the vault?

1607
00:56:56,920 --> 00:56:57,979
Yes.

1608
00:56:57,980 --> 00:57:00,618
(Yuims Bond chases after the excited Kwang Soo.)

1609
00:57:00,619 --> 00:57:01,701
My vault was here, so...

1610
00:57:01,960 --> 00:57:04,827
(He readies the vaccine.)

1611
00:57:04,828 --> 00:57:06,189
(At that moment,)

1612
00:57:06,190 --> 00:57:08,198
(he sees the water gun.)

1613
00:57:08,199 --> 00:57:09,613
That's incredible.

1614
00:57:10,099 --> 00:57:12,220
(Jae Seok fails.)

1615
00:57:13,099 --> 00:57:15,524
(He takes a different route so that he doesn't get caught.)

1616
00:57:15,799 --> 00:57:17,860
- Did you really find your vault? - Yes.

1617
00:57:18,139 --> 00:57:19,539
I found it right away.

1618
00:57:19,540 --> 00:57:22,065
(Yuims Bond lost an opportunity to administer the vaccine.)

1619
00:57:24,380 --> 00:57:26,127
Kwang Soo saw me.

1620
00:57:27,279 --> 00:57:30,785
(Did Kwang Soo figure out Yuims Bond's identity?)

1621
00:57:31,619 --> 00:57:32,988
(Yuims Bond and the Bond Girl meet again.)

1622
00:57:32,989 --> 00:57:34,488
- Do you know who the spy is? - What?

1623
00:57:34,489 --> 00:57:35,803
I have no clue.

1624
00:57:36,719 --> 00:57:39,052
Be careful. We have a lot of eyes on us.

1625
00:57:39,259 --> 00:57:42,593
I saved Se Chan. I need to save Kwang Soo now.

1626
00:57:42,900 --> 00:57:44,476
Please distract Kwang Soo.

1627
00:57:45,730 --> 00:57:47,098
(The Bong Girl gets to work.)

1628
00:57:47,099 --> 00:57:48,554
- Kwang Soo! - Yes?

1629
00:57:50,639 --> 00:57:52,408
(While the Bond Girl catches Kwang Soo's attention,)

1630
00:57:52,409 --> 00:57:54,025
It's not like I can tell you anything.

1631
00:57:54,210 --> 00:57:56,300
(Yuims Bond moves behind his back.)

1632
00:57:56,840 --> 00:57:59,077
Who is that?

1633
00:57:59,078 --> 00:58:01,200
(He diverts Kwang Soo's attention.)

1634
00:58:02,179 --> 00:58:04,077
- Who is that? - Did you find something?

1635
00:58:04,078 --> 00:58:05,118
(Kwang Soo's head is turned,)

1636
00:58:05,119 --> 00:58:06,907
(so this is a chance.)

1637
00:58:07,790 --> 00:58:09,258
(When Kwang Soo has his back on Jae Seok,)

1638
00:58:09,259 --> 00:58:10,919
I saved your life, Kwang Soo.

1639
00:58:10,920 --> 00:58:14,020
(he tries to shoot the water gun again.)

1640
00:58:15,730 --> 00:58:16,912
(Spraying)

1641
00:58:17,929 --> 00:58:19,399
(Since the first shot landed on the hat,)

1642
00:58:19,400 --> 00:58:21,925
(he shoots the name tag again.)

1643
00:58:21,969 --> 00:58:24,798
I saved two people.

1644
00:58:26,009 --> 00:58:28,433
What? Why am I being dragged away?

1645
00:58:29,279 --> 00:58:32,239
Where am I going? Where am I going?

1646
00:58:33,049 --> 00:58:34,508
- What is this? - What happened to you?

1647
00:58:34,509 --> 00:58:35,519
(They meet at the infirmary.)

1648
00:58:35,520 --> 00:58:37,019
I don't know why I am here.

1649
00:58:37,020 --> 00:58:38,130
What is that?

1650
00:58:38,820 --> 00:58:39,931
What is that on your back?

1651
00:58:40,090 --> 00:58:41,919
- What? - There is something green on it.

1652
00:58:41,920 --> 00:58:43,131
Is there something on my back?

1653
00:58:43,690 --> 00:58:45,042
- Yes, there is! - What?

1654
00:58:45,790 --> 00:58:46,800
What?

1655
00:58:47,190 --> 00:58:49,451
- Who did it? When? - Let me take a look.

1656
00:58:49,799 --> 00:58:51,769
- It's green. - It's on your back, too.

1657
00:58:51,770 --> 00:58:53,169
(By whom and when did this happen?)

1658
00:58:53,170 --> 00:58:54,381
Could it be Jae Seok?

1659
00:58:55,099 --> 00:58:56,399
- It's green. - Right?

1660
00:58:56,400 --> 00:58:58,769
- Jae Seok was Yuims Bond. - That's right.

1661
00:58:58,770 --> 00:59:00,008
(They are 100 percent sure it's Jae Seok.)

1662
00:59:00,009 --> 00:59:01,555
When did Jae Seok shoot me?

1663
00:59:02,779 --> 00:59:05,077
Then S could be Jae Seok's S.

1664
00:59:05,078 --> 00:59:07,979
It could also be Esom's S.

1665
00:59:07,980 --> 00:59:09,149
It could be Se Chan.

1666
00:59:09,150 --> 00:59:10,348
It could be you, Kwang Soo.

1667
00:59:10,349 --> 00:59:11,379
(Is Kwang Soo the Host S?)

1668
00:59:11,380 --> 00:59:12,399
Let's stop.

1669
00:59:13,619 --> 00:59:15,589
(They don't know who Host S is.)

1670
00:59:15,590 --> 00:59:17,508
This is driving me crazy.

1671
00:59:17,889 --> 00:59:20,459
Maybe it's outside. Where is it?

1672
00:59:20,460 --> 00:59:21,914
(He is diligently searching for the vault to win the prize.)

1673
00:59:22,730 --> 00:59:24,951
(What is that?)

1674
00:59:25,730 --> 00:59:28,123
(I hope it's not trash.)

1675
00:59:28,199 --> 00:59:30,391
I can't believe it.

1676
00:59:31,040 --> 00:59:33,709
Haha has found his vault.

1677
00:59:33,710 --> 00:59:34,921
(The fact he found his vault gets announced to everyone.)

1678
00:59:35,540 --> 00:59:38,509
(Haha has 10 minutes until he gets vaccinated.)

1679
00:59:39,210 --> 00:59:42,513
(Haha gets infected by Money Poison.)

1680
00:59:43,250 --> 00:59:44,778
I need to find Host S' vault.

1681
00:59:44,779 --> 00:59:46,567
(He needs to get vaccinated in 10 minutes.)

1682
00:59:47,049 --> 00:59:48,689
(Yuims Bond and the Bond Girl found out about Haha's infection.)

1683
00:59:48,690 --> 00:59:49,700
Who was that?

1684
00:59:49,989 --> 00:59:50,988
Haha.

1685
00:59:50,989 --> 00:59:52,388
(If Haha found the vault...)

1686
00:59:52,389 --> 00:59:54,528
I saw Haha's vault on the second floor.

1687
00:59:54,529 --> 00:59:55,899
- The second floor. - Where the radish is.

1688
00:59:55,900 --> 00:59:57,818
Where the radish is? I should go there.

1689
00:59:57,900 --> 00:59:59,040
Hold on.

1690
00:59:59,929 --> 01:00:01,899
- I will look for him. - Don't let anyone approach him.

1691
01:00:01,900 --> 01:00:03,183
(They spread out on the 2nd floor and look for Haha.)

1692
01:00:04,099 --> 01:00:07,140
(Find Haha and vaccinate him.)

1693
01:00:07,969 --> 01:00:09,626
Where is mine?

1694
01:00:10,380 --> 01:00:12,702
(Did she find a vault?)

1695
01:00:13,380 --> 01:00:14,479
(She found...)

1696
01:00:14,480 --> 01:00:15,763
It's Ji Hyo's.

1697
01:00:16,250 --> 01:00:19,089
What should I do? I will tell her when I see her.

1698
01:00:19,090 --> 01:00:20,807
Okay. Ji Hyo's vault is here.

1699
01:00:20,989 --> 01:00:23,359
- Ji Hyo! Your vault is here. - Really?

1700
01:00:23,360 --> 01:00:24,819
(Ji Hyo succeeds to find her vault.)

1701
01:00:24,820 --> 01:00:26,488
Ji Hyo, have you seen my vault?

1702
01:00:26,489 --> 01:00:28,899
I swear this is the first time I am seeing a vault.

1703
01:00:28,900 --> 01:00:30,198
Thank you, So Min.

1704
01:00:30,199 --> 01:00:31,644
(This is the first time she is seeing a vault.)

1705
01:00:31,799 --> 01:00:33,028
For goodness' sake.

1706
01:00:33,029 --> 01:00:34,899
(Thanks to So Min, she found her vault.)

1707
01:00:34,900 --> 01:00:37,798
Song Ji Hyo has found her vault.

1708
01:00:37,799 --> 01:00:40,536
(Yuims Bond hears the announcement while he is looking for Haha.)

1709
01:00:41,009 --> 01:00:43,138
So Min, did you find yours?

1710
01:00:43,139 --> 01:00:45,573
- I found Ji Hyo's vault. - For goodness' sake.

1711
01:00:45,679 --> 01:00:46,778
This is a disaster.

1712
01:00:46,779 --> 01:00:48,669
I need to hurry up and get them. What should I do?

1713
01:00:49,219 --> 01:00:50,749
(Ji Hyo is infected by Money Poison.)

1714
01:00:50,750 --> 01:00:51,800
I found it.

1715
01:00:52,590 --> 01:00:53,789
Ji Hyo, I am jealous.

1716
01:00:53,790 --> 01:00:55,789
- I found it. - My goodness.

1717
01:00:55,790 --> 01:00:56,919
So it was here.

1718
01:00:56,920 --> 01:00:58,158
(He approaches her fast.)

1719
01:00:58,159 --> 01:00:59,388
Is there money inside?

1720
01:00:59,389 --> 01:01:01,158
No, there is the prize coupon.

1721
01:01:01,159 --> 01:01:02,574
- Let me see it. - Here.

1722
01:01:03,099 --> 01:01:04,474
The prize coupon.

1723
01:01:04,759 --> 01:01:06,098
(Spraying)

1724
01:01:06,099 --> 01:01:08,169
(My goodness!)

1725
01:01:08,170 --> 01:01:10,724
(What is he doing?)

1726
01:01:12,440 --> 01:01:13,908
I saved your life.

1727
01:01:13,909 --> 01:01:15,960
Don't say a word. I saved your life.

1728
01:01:16,340 --> 01:01:18,369
You will find out later. Don't tell anyone.

1729
01:01:18,380 --> 01:01:19,390
(He succeeds to vaccinate Song Ji Hyo.)

1730
01:01:20,210 --> 01:01:21,919
(While Ji Hyo gets vaccinated,)

1731
01:01:21,920 --> 01:01:25,182
Here it is! Okay, I found it.

1732
01:01:26,989 --> 01:01:30,292
(Seok Jin gets infected by Money Poison.)

1733
01:01:31,320 --> 01:01:32,370
Okay.

1734
01:01:32,790 --> 01:01:34,506
I need to find Haha.

1735
01:01:34,529 --> 01:01:37,198
Seok Jin has found his vault.

1736
01:01:37,199 --> 01:01:39,528
Where is he? Where is Seok Jin?

1737
01:01:39,529 --> 01:01:40,569
Seok Jin!

1738
01:01:40,570 --> 01:01:42,720
- I found it. - Where was it?

1739
01:01:42,900 --> 01:01:44,757
- I found it. - That's incredible. Seok Jin.

1740
01:01:44,770 --> 01:01:45,908
- Did you find yours? - I need to find Host S' vault.

1741
01:01:45,909 --> 01:01:47,384
- Let's find it. - All right.

1742
01:01:48,310 --> 01:01:50,401
(Spraying)

1743
01:01:51,509 --> 01:01:53,278
(He succeeds to vaccinate Seok Jin.)

1744
01:01:53,279 --> 01:01:54,609
- I need to find Host S' vault. - Okay.

1745
01:01:54,610 --> 01:01:58,113
Let's do this today.

1746
01:01:58,889 --> 01:02:00,749
Okay.

1747
01:02:00,750 --> 01:02:03,043
(Seok Jin, have fun at the infirmary.)

1748
01:02:03,520 --> 01:02:06,286
I did it. I sent him off in a good mood.

1749
01:02:06,389 --> 01:02:08,798
I sent him off in a good mood.

1750
01:02:08,799 --> 01:02:10,158
(I am the happiest.)

1751
01:02:10,159 --> 01:02:11,827
I have a good feeling about this.

1752
01:02:11,828 --> 01:02:12,868
(It doesn't last long.)

1753
01:02:12,869 --> 01:02:14,717
Okay! What?

1754
01:02:15,400 --> 01:02:16,410
What is going on?

1755
01:02:17,739 --> 01:02:18,780
What is going on?

1756
01:02:19,940 --> 01:02:21,539
What is going on?

1757
01:02:21,540 --> 01:02:23,093
(You need to be isolated now.)

1758
01:02:24,078 --> 01:02:26,077
(Time passed quickly while Jae Seok kept himself busy.)

1759
01:02:26,078 --> 01:02:27,088
Ji Hyo.

1760
01:02:27,150 --> 01:02:28,778
(About 4 minutes remain until Haha's treatment.)

1761
01:02:28,779 --> 01:02:30,548
Did you find your vault? What is going on?

1762
01:02:30,549 --> 01:02:32,307
(At that moment!)

1763
01:02:33,449 --> 01:02:35,888
(Haha sees Ji Hyo get dragged away to the infirmary.)

1764
01:02:35,889 --> 01:02:36,899
What is going on?

1765
01:02:37,560 --> 01:02:38,902
(Haha, bye.)

1766
01:02:40,159 --> 01:02:42,729
(What is this situation?)

1767
01:02:42,730 --> 01:02:43,928
I saw it.

1768
01:02:43,929 --> 01:02:45,920
(Why did she get dragged away?)

1769
01:02:47,529 --> 01:02:48,539
(Not only that,)

1770
01:02:48,540 --> 01:02:49,598
What is going on?

1771
01:02:49,599 --> 01:02:51,760
(Seok Jin is getting dragged away as well.)

1772
01:02:51,969 --> 01:02:54,393
Those who found their vaults get eliminated.

1773
01:02:55,779 --> 01:02:58,406
(Yuims Bond is searching for Haha.)

1774
01:02:58,710 --> 01:03:00,527
- Jong Kook. - Yes?

1775
01:03:00,610 --> 01:03:01,979
You can get eliminated.

1776
01:03:01,980 --> 01:03:03,118
You can get eliminated?

1777
01:03:03,119 --> 01:03:05,519
Those who found their vaults got eliminated.

1778
01:03:05,520 --> 01:03:08,758
Really? Then you must be a target.

1779
01:03:08,759 --> 01:03:10,689
- You found your vault. - That's right.

1780
01:03:10,690 --> 01:03:14,295
Then you will get eliminated.

1781
01:03:15,029 --> 01:03:16,110
Bye, Haha.

1782
01:03:16,799 --> 01:03:18,012
I am so annoyed.

1783
01:03:18,599 --> 01:03:20,169
This isn't a prison.

1784
01:03:20,170 --> 01:03:22,368
Will we be released after we get treated?

1785
01:03:22,369 --> 01:03:25,209
They say that, but this is nothing more than a prison.

1786
01:03:25,210 --> 01:03:27,764
There is hope. I am not out. I am getting treated.

1787
01:03:27,840 --> 01:03:30,234
- You are out. - We are out.

1788
01:03:30,279 --> 01:03:31,278
You are out.

1789
01:03:31,279 --> 01:03:33,548
You aren't out. I can assure you...

1790
01:03:33,549 --> 01:03:35,979
that isn't the case. This isn't a prison,

1791
01:03:35,980 --> 01:03:37,379
but an infirmary.

1792
01:03:37,380 --> 01:03:39,519
- Hey, come here. - Come here.

1793
01:03:39,520 --> 01:03:41,106
(I have no patience for your nonsense.)

1794
01:03:41,250 --> 01:03:43,158
He is making fun of us.

1795
01:03:43,159 --> 01:03:44,459
You need to stop spouting nonsense.

1796
01:03:44,460 --> 01:03:46,388
- Seriously. - Come here.

1797
01:03:46,389 --> 01:03:48,499
You need to stop spouting nonsense.

1798
01:03:48,500 --> 01:03:50,928
This is a prison. We are out.

1799
01:03:50,929 --> 01:03:51,939
(The infirmary is full of despair and fury.)

1800
01:03:52,170 --> 01:03:55,698
I need to find Haha. Haha.

1801
01:03:55,699 --> 01:03:57,719
(About 1 minute remains.)

1802
01:03:58,400 --> 01:04:00,025
(At that moment!)

1803
01:04:00,810 --> 01:04:01,820
Haha.

1804
01:04:01,980 --> 01:04:03,859
Jae Seok, what is going on?

1805
01:04:04,279 --> 01:04:06,278
- What do you mean? - Those who found their vaults...

1806
01:04:06,279 --> 01:04:07,521
got eliminated.

1807
01:04:08,310 --> 01:04:10,577
You were by Seok Jin's side...

1808
01:04:10,578 --> 01:04:13,317
before he got eliminated. I saw you.

1809
01:04:15,360 --> 01:04:16,589
(What is that in his hand?)

1810
01:04:16,590 --> 01:04:18,711
Hold on. I think...

1811
01:04:18,759 --> 01:04:21,760
(Haha finally figures out what is going on.)

1812
01:04:22,159 --> 01:04:24,079
- You have been hiding it. - I am saving your life.

1813
01:04:24,360 --> 01:04:26,468
I am saving your life. Listen to me.

1814
01:04:26,469 --> 01:04:28,098
- Listen to me. - Hold on.

1815
01:04:28,099 --> 01:04:29,669
You will die otherwise.

1816
01:04:29,670 --> 01:04:30,999
What are you talking about?

1817
01:04:31,000 --> 01:04:32,669
What are you talking about?

1818
01:04:32,670 --> 01:04:33,769
Let go of me.

1819
01:04:33,770 --> 01:04:35,539
(Time passes while Haha resists.)

1820
01:04:35,540 --> 01:04:37,631
(Jae Seok uses a takedown.)

1821
01:04:38,480 --> 01:04:40,508
- My goodness. - I got him.

1822
01:04:40,509 --> 01:04:42,778
(Using his hunting skills,)

1823
01:04:42,779 --> 01:04:43,819
I am sorry.

1824
01:04:43,820 --> 01:04:44,992
(he succeeds to vaccinate Haha.)

1825
01:04:45,549 --> 01:04:47,206
Haha, I saved your life.

1826
01:04:48,290 --> 01:04:50,784
I can't believe it.

1827
01:04:52,290 --> 01:04:54,089
(The Bond Girl thinks about who the spy might be.)

1828
01:04:54,090 --> 01:04:56,150
Where is the spy? Who is the spy?

1829
01:04:56,400 --> 01:04:57,899
This spy isn't doing anything.

1830
01:04:57,900 --> 01:04:59,999
People I haven't seen are...

1831
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:01,788
Kyung Nam...

1832
01:05:02,840 --> 01:05:04,183
- Kyung Nam. - Yes?

1833
01:05:04,599 --> 01:05:06,186
What did you do all day today?

1834
01:05:06,840 --> 01:05:08,408
(With a strange laugh, he approaches Yuims Bond.)

1835
01:05:08,409 --> 01:05:09,450
Hold on.

1836
01:05:10,179 --> 01:05:11,654
Have you found your vault?

1837
01:05:12,179 --> 01:05:13,290
No, I haven't.

1838
01:05:14,150 --> 01:05:16,778
- Have you? - No. I am still searching.

1839
01:05:16,779 --> 01:05:18,649
- Really? - Where have you been?

1840
01:05:18,650 --> 01:05:21,189
- What? - Where have you been?

1841
01:05:21,190 --> 01:05:22,258
I was searching for my vault.

1842
01:05:22,259 --> 01:05:23,289
- Were you here all along? - Yes.

1843
01:05:23,290 --> 01:05:25,238
I was on my way out since my vault isn't here.

1844
01:05:25,659 --> 01:05:27,028
Don't you have anything?

1845
01:05:27,029 --> 01:05:28,776
(Scary)

1846
01:05:29,360 --> 01:05:30,359
No, I don't.

1847
01:05:30,360 --> 01:05:31,541
- Really? - I have nothing.

1848
01:05:31,560 --> 01:05:33,247
I heard that you are carrying something.

1849
01:05:33,770 --> 01:05:35,184
- I am? - Yes.

1850
01:05:35,299 --> 01:05:36,411
Something.

1851
01:05:37,099 --> 01:05:38,399
- Who said that? - What?

1852
01:05:38,400 --> 01:05:39,723
Who said that?

1853
01:05:39,770 --> 01:05:41,558
I heard that you are carrying something.

1854
01:05:42,239 --> 01:05:43,379
I am not carrying anything.

1855
01:05:43,380 --> 01:05:44,552
Really?

1856
01:05:44,739 --> 01:05:46,508
- You are acting strange. - No, no.

1857
01:05:46,509 --> 01:05:48,448
Everyone said you are acting strange.

1858
01:05:48,449 --> 01:05:49,979
- Me? - Yes.

1859
01:05:49,980 --> 01:05:51,548
I am simply searching.

1860
01:05:51,549 --> 01:05:52,689
- Really? - Yes.

1861
01:05:52,690 --> 01:05:53,819
- You are simply searching. - Yes.

1862
01:05:53,820 --> 01:05:55,289
You keep questioning me.

1863
01:05:55,290 --> 01:05:57,488
It's just that I heard something.

1864
01:05:57,489 --> 01:05:58,658
- Really? - Yes.

1865
01:05:58,659 --> 01:06:00,289
In any case, I will go and look for my vault.

1866
01:06:00,290 --> 01:06:02,359
(Yuims Bond leaves cautiously.)

1867
01:06:02,360 --> 01:06:04,116
(At that moment!)

1868
01:06:05,529 --> 01:06:08,630
(Kyung Nam chases after Yuims Bond.)

1869
01:06:09,400 --> 01:06:11,769
(Why is he following me?)

1870
01:06:11,770 --> 01:06:13,468
- Why do you keep... - No, no.

1871
01:06:13,469 --> 01:06:14,923
(Jae Seok doesn't have a clue about the spy.)

1872
01:06:15,810 --> 01:06:17,278
- Why do you keep... - No, no.

1873
01:06:17,279 --> 01:06:18,508
I just wanted to see your back.

1874
01:06:18,509 --> 01:06:19,649
My back?

1875
01:06:19,650 --> 01:06:21,528
I am not trying to do anything.

1876
01:06:21,909 --> 01:06:23,077
(Jae Seok's suspicion grows as Kyung Nam closes in.)

1877
01:06:23,078 --> 01:06:26,120
It looks like you are trying to do something.

1878
01:06:26,420 --> 01:06:27,448
No.

1879
01:06:27,449 --> 01:06:29,819
(Approaching slowly)

1880
01:06:29,820 --> 01:06:32,455
(Kyung Nam is right in front of Jae Seok.)

1881
01:06:33,159 --> 01:06:35,623
(Yuims Bond starts to run.)

1882
01:06:35,828 --> 01:06:39,032
(Kyung Nam goes back instead of chasing after him.)

1883
01:06:39,270 --> 01:06:40,569
Kyung Nam is being strange.

1884
01:06:40,570 --> 01:06:42,014
(Why is he going back?)

1885
01:06:42,639 --> 01:06:45,269
(At the peaceful infirmary)

1886
01:06:45,270 --> 01:06:46,481
I'm going to the restroom.

1887
01:06:47,840 --> 01:06:48,979
Don't get caught by...

1888
01:06:48,980 --> 01:06:50,394
- members who aren't eliminated. - Okay.

1889
01:06:50,909 --> 01:06:53,506
(He must be in a hurry.)

1890
01:06:53,849 --> 01:06:54,908
(While Kwang Soo goes to the restroom...)

1891
01:06:54,909 --> 01:06:55,930
Goodness.

1892
01:06:56,820 --> 01:06:57,859
What's this?

1893
01:06:58,219 --> 01:06:59,331
What now?

1894
01:07:00,449 --> 01:07:02,488
- What's wrong? - There's a quail egg.

1895
01:07:02,489 --> 01:07:04,258
(She has a quail egg in her hood.)

1896
01:07:04,259 --> 01:07:05,359
Did you put it in?

1897
01:07:05,360 --> 01:07:06,500
No.

1898
01:07:07,230 --> 01:07:09,078
Why is there a quail egg in my hood?

1899
01:07:10,060 --> 01:07:11,428
- I have one too. - What?

1900
01:07:11,429 --> 01:07:13,521
- There's a quail egg. - What's this?

1901
01:07:15,840 --> 01:07:16,968
I don't have one.

1902
01:07:16,969 --> 01:07:18,138
(Only Ji Hyo and Se Chan have a quail egg.)

1903
01:07:18,139 --> 01:07:20,130
Someone must put a quail egg in it.

1904
01:07:20,869 --> 01:07:22,238
Where's Kwang Soo?

1905
01:07:22,239 --> 01:07:23,926
(At that time, Kwang Soo disappeared.)

1906
01:07:24,480 --> 01:07:27,379
(After saying he's going to the restroom, he headed to...)

1907
01:07:27,380 --> 01:07:29,571
(a meeting room.)

1908
01:07:30,380 --> 01:07:33,019
(Why did Kwang Soo come here?)

1909
01:07:33,020 --> 01:07:34,048
Two letters.

1910
01:07:34,049 --> 01:07:36,089
(He says out of the blue.)

1911
01:07:36,090 --> 01:07:38,685
(What does he mean by "two letters"?)

1912
01:07:39,429 --> 01:07:44,409
(Kwang Soo receives a mysterious mission card.)

1913
01:07:45,469 --> 01:07:48,934
Kwang Soo is my special friend.

1914
01:07:49,139 --> 01:07:52,978
I'm here to ask you to make a race where Kwang Soo can win.

1915
01:07:53,670 --> 01:07:55,539
(Host S, Shin Ha Kyun)

1916
01:07:55,540 --> 01:07:59,778
Four years ago, he was selected as Yuims Bond's successor.

1917
01:07:59,779 --> 01:08:01,901
Then he was eliminated.

1918
01:08:02,250 --> 01:08:05,208
After what happened, Kwang Soo betrayed a lot.

1919
01:08:06,320 --> 01:08:08,718
He got spoiled.

1920
01:08:08,719 --> 01:08:11,218
(Kwang Soo wasn't like this before.)

1921
01:08:11,219 --> 01:08:14,119
I'm curious if you gave him second chance.

1922
01:08:14,190 --> 01:08:15,301
It's a pity.

1923
01:08:16,029 --> 01:08:18,968
I believe that Kwang Soo can pull off many things.

1924
01:08:18,969 --> 01:08:20,283
I have no doubt.

1925
01:08:20,799 --> 01:08:22,961
Please give him an opportunity...

1926
01:08:22,969 --> 01:08:24,868
to take revenge on Jae Seok.

1927
01:08:24,869 --> 01:08:26,223
(Revenge on Yuims Bond)

1928
01:08:26,770 --> 01:08:28,439
(Thanks to the special friend's request,)

1929
01:08:28,440 --> 01:08:29,878
(the mission is passed to Kwang Soo.)

1930
01:08:29,879 --> 01:08:32,678
Keep your identity a secret until the final race.

1931
01:08:32,980 --> 01:08:36,010
You'll succeed if you eliminate Jae Seok.

1932
01:08:36,348 --> 01:08:38,019
Do I get all the prize?

1933
01:08:38,020 --> 01:08:40,040
- You'll win 100,000 dollars. - 100,000 dollars?

1934
01:08:40,320 --> 01:08:41,633
- Do I take it all? - Yes.

1935
01:08:42,020 --> 01:08:44,948
If you fail, you will be penalized alone.

1936
01:08:45,560 --> 01:08:46,559
However,

1937
01:08:46,560 --> 01:08:48,306
you must find out...

1938
01:08:48,629 --> 01:08:50,347
how to eliminate Jae Seok on your own.

1939
01:08:50,700 --> 01:08:53,324
During the race that starts soon,

1940
01:08:53,570 --> 01:08:57,174
purchase nine quail eggs.

1941
01:08:57,870 --> 01:09:00,294
Quail eggs that I know?

1942
01:09:00,370 --> 01:09:01,380
Yes.

1943
01:09:02,240 --> 01:09:04,909
10 quail eggs, please.

1944
01:09:04,910 --> 01:09:06,867
(He orders quail eggs.)

1945
01:09:07,008 --> 01:09:10,818
(What do I have to do with quail eggs?)

1946
01:09:11,348 --> 01:09:12,949
(He finds a mission card in his vault.)

1947
01:09:12,950 --> 01:09:15,817
"The method to eliminate Jae Seok consists of nine letters."

1948
01:09:16,089 --> 01:09:18,519
"Each time you put a quail egg in other members' clothes."

1949
01:09:18,520 --> 01:09:19,843
"you'll be given one letter."

1950
01:09:20,530 --> 01:09:22,427
- This jacket looks strange. - Really?

1951
01:09:22,428 --> 01:09:23,757
(To eliminate Yuims Bond,)

1952
01:09:23,758 --> 01:09:25,059
(he put quail eggs in others' clothes.)

1953
01:09:25,060 --> 01:09:26,242
How many chairs are there?

1954
01:09:27,428 --> 01:09:30,228
(Kwang Soo was successful with Se Chan and Ji Hyo.)

1955
01:09:30,968 --> 01:09:32,739
If I figure out what it is...

1956
01:09:32,740 --> 01:09:34,409
and clear the mission,

1957
01:09:34,410 --> 01:09:35,479
is it over? Okay.

1958
01:09:36,610 --> 01:09:37,677
"Ki".

1959
01:09:37,678 --> 01:09:39,248
(The first letter is "Ki".)

1960
01:09:39,249 --> 01:09:40,279
"Ae"?

1961
01:09:40,280 --> 01:09:41,677
(The second letter is "Ae".)

1962
01:09:41,678 --> 01:09:43,698
("Ki" and "Ae")

1963
01:09:44,320 --> 01:09:47,588
To something something, do something something.

1964
01:09:47,589 --> 01:09:48,649
It's something like that.

1965
01:09:48,650 --> 01:09:51,185
(What's the method to eliminate Yuims Bond?)

1966
01:09:51,388 --> 01:09:52,427
I don't have time.

1967
01:09:52,428 --> 01:09:53,757
I think Jae Seok is almost finished.

1968
01:09:53,758 --> 01:09:54,989
(Before people find out who the spy is,)

1969
01:09:54,990 --> 01:09:56,757
(he must figure out how to eliminate Jae Seok.)

1970
01:09:56,758 --> 01:09:57,958
- Jong Kook. - He's still here.

1971
01:09:57,959 --> 01:09:59,297
You aren't eliminated yet.

1972
01:09:59,298 --> 01:10:01,350
I am eliminated, but I came back.

1973
01:10:01,770 --> 01:10:03,355
- How? - I don't know.

1974
01:10:03,400 --> 01:10:05,939
(He checks his 3 targets.)

1975
01:10:05,940 --> 01:10:07,569
No way. Are you eliminated?

1976
01:10:07,570 --> 01:10:09,109
- But you found the vault. - Yes.

1977
01:10:09,110 --> 01:10:10,838
- Why? - It's strange that you came out.

1978
01:10:10,839 --> 01:10:11,878
(Members start to suspect.)

1979
01:10:11,879 --> 01:10:13,809
It wasn't a prison. It was an infirmary.

1980
01:10:13,810 --> 01:10:14,890
- An infirmary. - Were you treated?

1981
01:10:14,980 --> 01:10:16,717
- Did you really leave? - Yes.

1982
01:10:16,718 --> 01:10:18,319
- Were you treated? - Yes.

1983
01:10:18,320 --> 01:10:19,619
Your face doesn't tell that you've been treated.

1984
01:10:19,620 --> 01:10:20,701
My face?

1985
01:10:21,218 --> 01:10:23,059
(His face is poisoned with money.)

1986
01:10:23,060 --> 01:10:24,878
How can you tell based on my face?

1987
01:10:24,919 --> 01:10:26,948
- I don't think he was treated. - I was.

1988
01:10:26,990 --> 01:10:28,374
What should we do?

1989
01:10:28,830 --> 01:10:31,797
What do we do? A lot was revealed, including Jae Seok's identity.

1990
01:10:31,798 --> 01:10:33,229
We can't pretend that we don't know.

1991
01:10:33,230 --> 01:10:35,522
- What do we do? - Shall we look for the vault?

1992
01:10:35,839 --> 01:10:38,426
I couldn't find my vault. I looked everywhere.

1993
01:10:38,468 --> 01:10:39,637
I can't find mine either.

1994
01:10:39,638 --> 01:10:41,569
There's no Host S' vault either.

1995
01:10:41,570 --> 01:10:43,579
- Are you sure you couldn't find it? - No.

1996
01:10:43,580 --> 01:10:45,022
I only saw Seok Jin's.

1997
01:10:45,339 --> 01:10:47,609
I think you should find your vault.

1998
01:10:47,610 --> 01:10:49,479
I came back from the infirmary.

1999
01:10:49,480 --> 01:10:52,953
I bet you found your vault, and Jae Seok gave you the water gun.

2000
01:10:53,919 --> 01:10:56,619
(Are Jae Seok and Kwang Soo on the same team?)

2001
01:10:56,620 --> 01:10:57,689
That's why...

2002
01:10:57,690 --> 01:10:59,059
Search him if he has a water gun.

2003
01:10:59,060 --> 01:11:00,229
Search him now.

2004
01:11:00,230 --> 01:11:02,628
(A sudden inspection starts.)

2005
01:11:02,629 --> 01:11:04,659
- There's no way. - Isn't he suspicious?

2006
01:11:04,660 --> 01:11:08,729
(Quail eggs are hidden in Kwang Soo's pocket.)

2007
01:11:08,730 --> 01:11:11,038
(They might find out who he is.)

2008
01:11:11,039 --> 01:11:12,038
There's no way.

2009
01:11:12,039 --> 01:11:14,739
His vault was easier to find than I thought.

2010
01:11:14,740 --> 01:11:15,890
(Just then,)

2011
01:11:16,240 --> 01:11:18,239
(Kwang Soo hides his quail eggs with his hand.)

2012
01:11:18,240 --> 01:11:21,076
His vault was easier to find than I thought.

2013
01:11:21,910 --> 01:11:23,649
- Stand up. - Why are you searching everywhere?

2014
01:11:23,650 --> 01:11:24,779
(Will he avert the crisis?)

2015
01:11:24,780 --> 01:11:25,830
Is there anything in your pockets?

2016
01:11:25,848 --> 01:11:26,930
No.

2017
01:11:28,150 --> 01:11:29,189
We have to undress him.

2018
01:11:29,190 --> 01:11:30,977
- He hides things in strange places. - He does.

2019
01:11:32,020 --> 01:11:33,458
(It's necessary to strip him down.)

2020
01:11:33,459 --> 01:11:35,551
Would I put a water gun there?

2021
01:11:35,959 --> 01:11:38,029
- Here's why. - Would I put a water gun there?

2022
01:11:38,030 --> 01:11:40,128
He must be searched as thoroughly...

2023
01:11:40,129 --> 01:11:41,869
as they do in prison.

2024
01:11:41,870 --> 01:11:43,354
(Speechless)

2025
01:11:44,138 --> 01:11:45,584
Don't say that in front of Kyung Nam.

2026
01:11:45,839 --> 01:11:47,609
- It's in that movie. - Right.

2027
01:11:47,610 --> 01:11:48,637
- "Get on all fours." - Come on.

2028
01:11:48,638 --> 01:11:49,822
"Get on all fours and cough."

2029
01:11:50,379 --> 01:11:51,996
Why would you cough?

2030
01:11:52,039 --> 01:11:53,149
Didn't you see those movies?

2031
01:11:53,150 --> 01:11:54,968
Does a water gun come out if you get on all fours and cough?

2032
01:11:55,348 --> 01:11:56,894
- It's nonsense. - They do.

2033
01:11:57,718 --> 01:11:58,891
Never.

2034
01:11:59,020 --> 01:12:00,088
Haven't you tried it?

2035
01:12:00,089 --> 01:12:01,706
- I know. I saw it in a movie. - Didn't you see it?

2036
01:12:02,089 --> 01:12:03,332
It's upsetting.

2037
01:12:04,089 --> 01:12:05,628
Did he put quail eggs in your clothes?

2038
01:12:05,629 --> 01:12:06,670
No.

2039
01:12:06,690 --> 01:12:08,882
He didn't have time for that. I was watching you.

2040
01:12:08,888 --> 01:12:10,312
Are there quail eggs?

2041
01:12:10,499 --> 01:12:11,712
Why is it quail eggs?

2042
01:12:12,298 --> 01:12:13,583
Does "quail" mean...

2043
01:12:14,098 --> 01:12:15,269
"infer the grasshopper"?

2044
01:12:15,270 --> 01:12:18,270
(Infer the grasshopper?)

2045
01:12:18,638 --> 01:12:20,125
- That isn't bad. - I agree.

2046
01:12:20,169 --> 01:12:21,382
Why is it quail?

2047
01:12:22,310 --> 01:12:23,939
Chaser of a grasshopper, Lee Kwang Soo.

2048
01:12:23,940 --> 01:12:25,324
(He makes up phrases.)

2049
01:12:25,410 --> 01:12:26,779
That's not bad.

2050
01:12:26,780 --> 01:12:28,931
Right? Chaser of a grasshopper, Lee Kwang Soo.

2051
01:12:29,280 --> 01:12:30,619
That's not bad, Seok Jin.

2052
01:12:30,620 --> 01:12:32,365
Do you think...

2053
01:12:32,718 --> 01:12:33,989
two of them are plotting all this?

2054
01:12:33,990 --> 01:12:35,689
(They have no idea what's going on.)

2055
01:12:35,690 --> 01:12:37,003
Have you seen Jae Seok?

2056
01:12:37,459 --> 01:12:39,046
- What? - Have you seen Jae Seok?

2057
01:12:39,330 --> 01:12:40,387
No.

2058
01:12:40,388 --> 01:12:41,601
- Kwang Soo. - Yes?

2059
01:12:42,700 --> 01:12:44,112
Who are you?

2060
01:12:44,459 --> 01:12:46,793
I don't know. I'm just looking for S.

2061
01:12:47,428 --> 01:12:48,628
Who are you?

2062
01:12:48,629 --> 01:12:50,199
(He's questioning like a detective.)

2063
01:12:50,200 --> 01:12:51,838
- What? - Who are you?

2064
01:12:51,839 --> 01:12:52,967
(He's flustered by pressure from Jong Kook.)

2065
01:12:52,968 --> 01:12:54,038
What do you mean?

2066
01:12:54,039 --> 01:12:55,409
Who are you?

2067
01:12:55,410 --> 01:12:57,560
Tell me who you are.

2068
01:12:57,709 --> 01:12:58,838
If you want to say something, say it.

2069
01:12:58,839 --> 01:13:00,007
(Detective Jong Kook leads him on.)

2070
01:13:00,008 --> 01:13:02,547
(If I want to say something, say it?)

2071
01:13:02,548 --> 01:13:04,119
Can you close your eyes and stay still for 10 seconds?

2072
01:13:04,120 --> 01:13:05,562
(Can you close your eyes and stay still for 10 seconds?)

2073
01:13:05,789 --> 01:13:08,042
(Let me put a quail egg in your clothes.)

2074
01:13:08,388 --> 01:13:09,489
(The most simple and suspicious in all the 10 years.)

2075
01:13:09,490 --> 01:13:10,859
Stay like this for 10 seconds.

2076
01:13:10,860 --> 01:13:12,019
(Since it already turned out this way...)

2077
01:13:12,020 --> 01:13:13,140
Don't do anything.

2078
01:13:13,330 --> 01:13:14,370
10 seconds?

2079
01:13:14,660 --> 01:13:16,477
That's too strange.

2080
01:13:16,499 --> 01:13:18,479
Is there any other way?

2081
01:13:18,860 --> 01:13:20,668
Why did you ask me to tell you?

2082
01:13:20,669 --> 01:13:23,769
- Why? - You should think of other ways.

2083
01:13:23,770 --> 01:13:26,668
We can't play Roses of Sharon.

2084
01:13:26,669 --> 01:13:28,729
- Let's play that game. - The two of us?

2085
01:13:28,968 --> 01:13:30,190
I mean...

2086
01:13:30,379 --> 01:13:31,939
(He's getting more suspicious.)

2087
01:13:31,940 --> 01:13:33,609
- It's hard. - I don't understand exactly.

2088
01:13:33,610 --> 01:13:35,297
I don't understand.

2089
01:13:35,548 --> 01:13:37,540
What's certain is that we must find it.

2090
01:13:38,480 --> 01:13:39,689
Find what?

2091
01:13:39,690 --> 01:13:40,748
The box.

2092
01:13:40,749 --> 01:13:42,809
The secret key.

2093
01:13:43,060 --> 01:13:44,757
(He sounds so awkward.)

2094
01:13:44,758 --> 01:13:45,871
Kwang Soo.

2095
01:13:46,330 --> 01:13:48,652
The roses of Sharon have blossomed.

2096
01:13:48,690 --> 01:13:50,314
Don't peek!

2097
01:13:51,098 --> 01:13:54,330
(Help me properly, Jong Kook.)

2098
01:13:55,030 --> 01:13:57,199
(There must be something.)

2099
01:13:57,200 --> 01:13:58,512
Wait.

2100
01:13:59,270 --> 01:14:01,765
Are you saying that I should find my vault?

2101
01:14:01,839 --> 01:14:03,728
(He's getting exhausted.)

2102
01:14:04,410 --> 01:14:05,491
I'll do it.

2103
01:14:05,610 --> 01:14:08,208
- Kwang Soo, either way, - Yes?

2104
01:14:08,209 --> 01:14:09,331
(Dropping)

2105
01:14:09,919 --> 01:14:12,818
(He successfully puts in a quail egg.)

2106
01:14:13,620 --> 01:14:15,288
(He manages to put it in.)

2107
01:14:15,289 --> 01:14:17,107
We have to hurry and catch Jae Seok.

2108
01:14:17,388 --> 01:14:18,458
- Kwang Soo. - Yes?

2109
01:14:18,459 --> 01:14:20,288
(He receives another letter.)

2110
01:14:20,289 --> 01:14:21,458
You're behind.

2111
01:14:21,459 --> 01:14:23,046
Jae Seok... What is it?

2112
01:14:23,798 --> 01:14:24,859
Esom, did you find it?

2113
01:14:24,860 --> 01:14:28,467
(Esom passes by randomly.)

2114
01:14:28,468 --> 01:14:29,668
What? The vault?

2115
01:14:29,669 --> 01:14:30,953
- I couldn't find it. - Did you find the vault?

2116
01:14:31,770 --> 01:14:32,921
You couldn't?

2117
01:14:34,039 --> 01:14:36,867
(Everyone goes their ways to find the vault.)

2118
01:14:37,080 --> 01:14:38,554
(Wait!)

2119
01:14:38,879 --> 01:14:40,579
(Is Kwang Soo walking around when he got shot by a water gun?)

2120
01:14:40,580 --> 01:14:42,469
(What happened?)

2121
01:14:44,480 --> 01:14:49,842
(Esom saw Kwang Soo getting shot by a water gun.)

2122
01:14:51,360 --> 01:14:57,155
(The spy doesn't get treated in isolation.)

2123
01:14:57,860 --> 01:14:59,529
I'll go this way and look for it.

2124
01:14:59,530 --> 01:15:00,729
- Where? - I'll go this way.

2125
01:15:00,730 --> 01:15:02,967
(Kwang Soo is the spy.)

2126
01:15:02,968 --> 01:15:06,475
(She must tell Yuims Bond that Kwang Soo is the spy.)

2127
01:15:07,339 --> 01:15:10,909
(Kwang Soo obtains "Jae".)

2128
01:15:10,910 --> 01:15:12,050
"Jae".

2129
01:15:13,209 --> 01:15:14,479
What are you doing?

2130
01:15:14,480 --> 01:15:15,507
(He tries his mission on So Min as well.)

2131
01:15:15,508 --> 01:15:16,547
What are you doing?

2132
01:15:16,548 --> 01:15:18,149
- Why are you doing this? - Wait.

2133
01:15:18,150 --> 01:15:19,905
(He puts in a quail egg.)

2134
01:15:20,848 --> 01:15:23,445
(He also obtains "Li".)

2135
01:15:23,560 --> 01:15:25,757
(While Kwang Soo is doing well...)

2136
01:15:25,758 --> 01:15:27,476
Kyung Nam is very strange.

2137
01:15:27,990 --> 01:15:30,628
(Yuims Bond suspects Kyung Nam.)

2138
01:15:30,629 --> 01:15:32,144
I'm sure that Kyung Nam is the spy.

2139
01:15:33,030 --> 01:15:34,747
He keeps looking for me.

2140
01:15:34,830 --> 01:15:37,426
(Kyung Nam is sacrificed for Kwang Soo's mission.)

2141
01:15:38,339 --> 01:15:41,838
(Kwang Soo obtains "Gyal".)

2142
01:15:41,839 --> 01:15:44,566
("Gyal")

2143
01:15:46,410 --> 01:15:47,809
"Gyal" definitely refers to eggs.

2144
01:15:47,810 --> 01:15:50,476
("Gyal" definitely refers to eggs.)

2145
01:15:52,690 --> 01:15:55,689
("Ki", "Ae", "Li", "Jae", and "Gyal")

2146
01:15:55,690 --> 01:15:57,088
It's something related to eggs.

2147
01:15:57,089 --> 01:15:59,080
(Eggs)

2148
01:15:59,289 --> 01:16:02,459
Put an egg in Jae Seok's something.

2149
01:16:02,660 --> 01:16:04,059
Put an egg in Jae Seok's body?

2150
01:16:04,060 --> 01:16:06,655
(Put an egg in Jae Seok's body?)

2151
01:16:07,098 --> 01:16:09,118
(As he finds out the way to eliminate Jae Seok,)

2152
01:16:09,770 --> 01:16:11,069
(Esom has come to Yuims Bond.)

2153
01:16:11,070 --> 01:16:12,149
Jae Seok.

2154
01:16:13,810 --> 01:16:16,279
I saw Kwang Soo, he got out from the infirmary.

2155
01:16:16,280 --> 01:16:17,350
He was with Jong Kook.

2156
01:16:17,940 --> 01:16:19,930
Didn't you shoot him with a water gun?

2157
01:16:20,678 --> 01:16:21,993
Kwang Soo got out?

2158
01:16:22,718 --> 01:16:23,931
Kwang Soo got out?

2159
01:16:24,080 --> 01:16:25,261
He did.

2160
01:16:25,348 --> 01:16:26,418
He's coming.

2161
01:16:26,419 --> 01:16:27,619
Kwang Soo is the spy.

2162
01:16:27,620 --> 01:16:29,387
(Kwang Soo is the spy.)

2163
01:16:29,388 --> 01:16:30,489
Kwang Soo is the spy.

2164
01:16:30,490 --> 01:16:32,288
(Yuims Bond has figured out who the spy is.)

2165
01:16:32,289 --> 01:16:35,029
(And the spy shows up.)

2166
01:16:35,030 --> 01:16:37,628
(Kwang Soo also spots Jae Seok.)

2167
01:16:37,629 --> 01:16:39,269
- What are you doing over there? - What are you doing?

2168
01:16:39,270 --> 01:16:40,411
What are you doing over there?

2169
01:16:40,499 --> 01:16:41,829
What are you doing?

2170
01:16:41,830 --> 01:16:42,979
(Why is Esom with him?)

2171
01:16:44,570 --> 01:16:45,569
Jae Seok.

2172
01:16:45,570 --> 01:16:47,257
(Yuims Bond wins if he shoots his water gun at his face.)

2173
01:16:47,638 --> 01:16:50,378
(He doesn't know exactly how to eliminate Jae Seok.)

2174
01:16:50,379 --> 01:16:51,479
Go to him.

2175
01:16:51,480 --> 01:16:52,662
It's Kwang Soo.

2176
01:16:52,910 --> 01:16:54,047
Catch Kwang Soo.

2177
01:16:54,048 --> 01:16:57,615
(Their chase starts.)

2178
01:16:58,520 --> 01:17:00,649
(He hides himself in the infirmary.)

2179
01:17:00,650 --> 01:17:01,649
What?

2180
01:17:01,650 --> 01:17:02,659
(What's going on?)

2181
01:17:02,660 --> 01:17:04,205
It's Kwang Soo. Kwang Soo.

2182
01:17:04,459 --> 01:17:06,029
(He's completely surrounded.)

2183
01:17:06,030 --> 01:17:07,628
Kwang Soo, what are you doing?

2184
01:17:07,629 --> 01:17:08,842
What?

2185
01:17:09,560 --> 01:17:10,810
Lee Kwang Soo.

2186
01:17:11,860 --> 01:17:13,244
Lee Kwang Soo.

2187
01:17:14,730 --> 01:17:18,477
(They're standing with a door in between.)

2188
01:17:19,240 --> 01:17:22,569
(Yuims Bond wins if he shoots water at Kwang Soo's face.)

2189
01:17:22,570 --> 01:17:24,309
(At that time)

2190
01:17:24,310 --> 01:17:27,207
Kim Kyung Nam has found the vault.

2191
01:17:28,379 --> 01:17:30,579
(He found the vault?)

2192
01:17:30,580 --> 01:17:31,689
Wait.

2193
01:17:33,150 --> 01:17:36,049
(Kyung Nam finds the vault hidden in the meeting room.)

2194
01:17:37,020 --> 01:17:40,659
(Kyung Nam is infected by Money Poison.)

2195
01:17:40,660 --> 01:17:44,199
(Unless he's vaccinated in 10 minutes, the race is over.)

2196
01:17:44,200 --> 01:17:45,427
Eliminate Kyung Nam.

2197
01:17:45,428 --> 01:17:47,329
I'll go in with Kyung Nam and eliminate Kwang Soo.

2198
01:17:47,330 --> 01:17:48,642
(Yuims Bond goes to find Kyung Nam.)

2199
01:17:51,070 --> 01:17:52,338
What's going on?

2200
01:17:52,339 --> 01:17:53,967
He isn't eliminated.

2201
01:17:53,968 --> 01:17:55,655
- Wait. - What's with the quail egg?

2202
01:17:56,480 --> 01:17:59,007
(It's his last chance to turn the tables.)

2203
01:17:59,008 --> 01:18:00,279
Aren't these quail eggs?

2204
01:18:00,280 --> 01:18:03,784
(He attempts to clear his mission on Seok Jin.)

2205
01:18:04,548 --> 01:18:06,235
- Stop it. - What is it?

2206
01:18:06,388 --> 01:18:08,106
What is it?

2207
01:18:08,320 --> 01:18:09,359
Stop it.

2208
01:18:09,360 --> 01:18:11,059
(And)

2209
01:18:11,060 --> 01:18:12,159
It went in.

2210
01:18:12,160 --> 01:18:14,729
(He puts a quail egg in his mouth.)

2211
01:18:14,730 --> 01:18:15,841
It went in his mouth.

2212
01:18:16,298 --> 01:18:17,597
(He successfully puts in a quail egg.)

2213
01:18:17,598 --> 01:18:19,690
- Hey. - It went into his body.

2214
01:18:20,468 --> 01:18:21,699
- What is it? - What is it?

2215
01:18:21,700 --> 01:18:23,517
- What is it? - What is it?

2216
01:18:24,098 --> 01:18:25,097
What is it?

2217
01:18:25,098 --> 01:18:26,856
- Seriously. - What is it?

2218
01:18:28,138 --> 01:18:30,378
(He obtains "Kkae".)

2219
01:18:30,379 --> 01:18:32,177
"Kkae"?

2220
01:18:32,178 --> 01:18:35,311
("Kkae")

2221
01:18:35,548 --> 01:18:37,819
Against Jae Seok's something,

2222
01:18:37,820 --> 01:18:39,149
break an egg.

2223
01:18:39,150 --> 01:18:41,387
("Li" remains.)

2224
01:18:41,388 --> 01:18:42,519
"Li"?

2225
01:18:42,520 --> 01:18:43,730
It's his head.

2226
01:18:43,860 --> 01:18:45,387
"Break an egg on Jae Seok's head."

2227
01:18:45,388 --> 01:18:49,228
("Break an egg on Jae Seok's head.")

2228
01:18:49,560 --> 01:18:52,659
- He's not eliminated. - That is correct.

2229
01:18:52,660 --> 01:18:54,069
Okay, okay.

2230
01:18:54,070 --> 01:18:56,467
(If he breaks an egg on Jae Seok's head, he wins.)

2231
01:18:56,468 --> 01:18:57,853
It's over once I break it.

2232
01:18:57,940 --> 01:18:59,555
All right. Let's go.

2233
01:19:01,310 --> 01:19:02,349
I'm in trouble.

2234
01:19:02,669 --> 01:19:04,498
I have to eliminate him.

2235
01:19:06,379 --> 01:19:08,149
(He goes to catch Yuims Bond.)

2236
01:19:08,150 --> 01:19:09,865
Where are you going, Kwang Soo?

2237
01:19:10,848 --> 01:19:12,868
Where are you going, Kwang Soo?

2238
01:19:13,620 --> 01:19:15,034
Kwang Soo!

2239
01:19:15,990 --> 01:19:17,519
Kwang Soo!

2240
01:19:17,520 --> 01:19:19,288
(It's Esom's voice.)

2241
01:19:19,289 --> 01:19:20,529
(Kwang Soo came out.)

2242
01:19:20,530 --> 01:19:21,829
Where are you going?

2243
01:19:21,830 --> 01:19:22,870
Don't follow me.

2244
01:19:23,060 --> 01:19:24,159
Don't.

2245
01:19:24,160 --> 01:19:26,491
(She goes after Kwang Soo.)

2246
01:19:27,730 --> 01:19:30,199
(Kwang Soo wins once he breaks an egg on Jae Seok's head.)

2247
01:19:30,200 --> 01:19:33,270
(Jae Seok wins once he shoots water on Kwang Soo's face.)

2248
01:19:35,138 --> 01:19:36,739
(At that time)

2249
01:19:36,740 --> 01:19:41,457
(Yuims Bond spots Kwang Soo first.)

2250
01:19:43,020 --> 01:19:46,047
(He sees Jae Seok approaching.)

2251
01:19:46,048 --> 01:19:47,333
Why are you out here?

2252
01:19:48,218 --> 01:19:49,248
Jae Seok.

2253
01:19:49,249 --> 01:19:50,704
Why are you out here?

2254
01:19:51,758 --> 01:19:52,768
Why are you...

2255
01:19:52,990 --> 01:19:54,374
Why did you shoot water at me?

2256
01:19:54,888 --> 01:19:56,443
You should be eliminated.

2257
01:19:56,900 --> 01:19:58,699
- Why are you out here? - I mean...

2258
01:19:58,700 --> 01:20:00,084
(Yuims Bond versus Spy)

2259
01:20:02,230 --> 01:20:04,338
(4 years ago, Kwang Soo took...)

2260
01:20:04,339 --> 01:20:08,550
(a test to become Yuims Bond's successor.)

2261
01:20:09,008 --> 01:20:10,479
I trust your judgment.

2262
01:20:10,480 --> 01:20:15,847
(During the last successor test, he was eliminated as he betrayed.)

2263
01:20:15,848 --> 01:20:16,949
I knew it.

2264
01:20:16,950 --> 01:20:18,217
I knew you'd betray me.

2265
01:20:18,218 --> 01:20:20,047
(After 4 years,)

2266
01:20:20,048 --> 01:20:22,217
(they face each other again.)

2267
01:20:22,218 --> 01:20:23,757
- What? - How is this saving me?

2268
01:20:23,758 --> 01:20:25,088
It's to save you.

2269
01:20:25,089 --> 01:20:26,559
(It's the last battle to end their ill-fated relationship.)

2270
01:20:26,560 --> 01:20:27,859
Why are you out here?

2271
01:20:27,860 --> 01:20:31,399
(Will he shoot water at Kwang Soo's face?)

2272
01:20:31,400 --> 01:20:32,529
How is this saving me?

2273
01:20:32,530 --> 01:20:35,497
(Will he break an egg on Jae Seok's head?)

2274
01:20:36,129 --> 01:20:37,786
- It's to save you. - Look behind you.

2275
01:20:38,240 --> 01:20:40,229
(He shoots.)

2276
01:20:40,440 --> 01:20:43,368
(When Kwang Soo moves, Jae Seok sprays water.)

2277
01:20:43,480 --> 01:20:45,739
(Water hits Kwang Soo right on his face.)

2278
01:20:45,740 --> 01:20:47,649
(Kwang Soo is eliminated.)

2279
01:20:47,650 --> 01:20:48,791
You punk.

2280
01:20:49,348 --> 01:20:50,819
(I can't end like this.)

2281
01:20:50,820 --> 01:20:52,335
(Breaking)

2282
01:20:52,848 --> 01:20:55,516
(I waited 4 years.)

2283
01:20:56,660 --> 01:20:58,918
(I won't let you leave in peace.)

2284
01:20:58,919 --> 01:21:02,223
(He throws raw eggs with resentment.)

2285
01:21:03,330 --> 01:21:08,249
(It's a ceremony where they pat each other on the head.)

2286
01:21:09,940 --> 01:21:11,353
- Hey. - What?

2287
01:21:11,798 --> 01:21:13,338
- Let go. - This isn't the end.

2288
01:21:13,339 --> 01:21:14,409
(Yuims Bond is the final winner.)

2289
01:21:14,410 --> 01:21:15,984
I broke the egg.

2290
01:21:16,810 --> 01:21:19,202
(The final race ends.)

2291
01:21:19,410 --> 01:21:20,519
Everyone.

2292
01:21:20,678 --> 01:21:22,279
He invited you here.

2293
01:21:22,280 --> 01:21:23,547
All of you are curious about him.

2294
01:21:23,548 --> 01:21:25,449
- Here is Host S. - What?

2295
01:21:25,450 --> 01:21:26,519
What?

2296
01:21:26,520 --> 01:21:28,063
- Please come out. - Who is it?

2297
01:21:28,320 --> 01:21:29,757
Is S coming out now?

2298
01:21:29,758 --> 01:21:31,233
It must be a video.

2299
01:21:31,320 --> 01:21:33,107
- Is it a video? - Is it?

2300
01:21:33,230 --> 01:21:34,829
He's really here.

2301
01:21:34,830 --> 01:21:36,042
Goodness.

2302
01:21:36,598 --> 01:21:37,729
(Spy Kwang Soo's guardian)

2303
01:21:37,730 --> 01:21:38,998
- Hello. - Ha Kyun.

2304
01:21:38,999 --> 01:21:40,097
Ha Kyun.

2305
01:21:40,098 --> 01:21:42,399
(Host S is Shin Ha Kyun.)

2306
01:21:42,400 --> 01:21:44,168
- What? - What's with Ha Kyun?

2307
01:21:44,169 --> 01:21:45,538
Isn't it too late for him to come out?

2308
01:21:45,539 --> 01:21:46,909
Ha Kyun.

2309
01:21:46,910 --> 01:21:49,092
Why did you come out earlier?

2310
01:21:49,740 --> 01:21:50,952
Ha Kyun will give...

2311
01:21:51,209 --> 01:21:54,076
Yuims Bond and the Bond Girl, Esom,

2312
01:21:54,178 --> 01:21:56,717
an honorable gold card.

2313
01:21:56,718 --> 01:21:58,079
Thank you.

2314
01:21:58,080 --> 01:21:59,392
Thank you.

2315
01:22:00,589 --> 01:22:01,689
"Honorable"?

2316
01:22:01,690 --> 01:22:03,189
- It's real. - "Honorable".

2317
01:22:03,190 --> 01:22:04,387
(It's an honorable golden color.)

2318
01:22:04,388 --> 01:22:06,582
- It's real gold. - It really is.

2319
01:22:07,388 --> 01:22:09,059
Let's hear from him.

2320
01:22:09,060 --> 01:22:10,659
Seriously.

2321
01:22:10,660 --> 01:22:13,456
I didn't expect Ha Kyun to come out at the end.

2322
01:22:13,629 --> 01:22:15,991
It's his first time on a variety show, so it's sad.

2323
01:22:16,129 --> 01:22:17,569
(You're right.)

2324
01:22:17,570 --> 01:22:18,998
It's his first time on a variety show,

2325
01:22:18,999 --> 01:22:20,654
but he hasn't yet said a word.

2326
01:22:22,070 --> 01:22:24,464
I feel so awkward.

2327
01:22:24,610 --> 01:22:26,579
During the show opening,

2328
01:22:26,580 --> 01:22:29,677
the three of you who appeared on the same movie made a pledge.

2329
01:22:29,678 --> 01:22:31,217
If you reach five million in the audience,

2330
01:22:31,218 --> 01:22:32,847
you'll join us...

2331
01:22:32,848 --> 01:22:33,949
on the show.

2332
01:22:33,950 --> 01:22:36,559
If five million is okay,

2333
01:22:36,560 --> 01:22:38,257
can you join us?

2334
01:22:38,258 --> 01:22:39,859
Come with Kyung Nam and Esom.

2335
01:22:39,860 --> 01:22:41,387
- They promised. - All of us?

2336
01:22:41,388 --> 01:22:42,588
That's right.

2337
01:22:42,589 --> 01:22:44,329
(What will be Ha Kyun's response?)

2338
01:22:44,330 --> 01:22:45,340
Okay.

2339
01:22:45,428 --> 01:22:47,691
Ha Kyun promised.

2340
01:22:47,770 --> 01:22:50,365
As he responded,

2341
01:22:50,539 --> 01:22:52,419
he didn't seem to feel good about it.

2342
01:22:52,870 --> 01:22:55,038
- It's five million. - Right.

2343
01:22:55,039 --> 01:22:56,708
If it reaches five million, he'll be happy and come out.

2344
01:22:56,709 --> 01:22:59,109
- Of course. - Come on, it's five million.

2345
01:22:59,110 --> 01:23:00,409
Lastly,

2346
01:23:00,410 --> 01:23:03,279
Kwang Soo failed his mission today.

2347
01:23:03,280 --> 01:23:05,138
We prepared to hit him today.

2348
01:23:05,320 --> 01:23:07,449
As he disappointed his special friend,

2349
01:23:07,450 --> 01:23:09,619
his special friend gets to spank him.

2350
01:23:09,620 --> 01:23:10,619
I see.

2351
01:23:10,620 --> 01:23:12,034
Please take your position.

2352
01:23:12,490 --> 01:23:15,387
I don't know about Ha Kyun.

2353
01:23:15,388 --> 01:23:17,427
- I wonder how he will hit him. - How will he?

2354
01:23:17,428 --> 01:23:19,620
- Ha Kyun plays golf these days. - Does he?

2355
01:23:19,700 --> 01:23:21,329
He has a high batting average.

2356
01:23:21,330 --> 01:23:22,399
(He's in the best condition to hit.)

2357
01:23:22,400 --> 01:23:24,763
Take a comfortable position.

2358
01:23:25,138 --> 01:23:26,507
- How hard will you hit? - Don't get nervous.

2359
01:23:26,508 --> 01:23:27,708
(Nervous)

2360
01:23:27,709 --> 01:23:29,239
Do well, Kwang Soo.

2361
01:23:29,240 --> 01:23:31,137
(He changes completely.)

2362
01:23:31,138 --> 01:23:32,351
Okay.

2363
01:23:32,678 --> 01:23:33,708
(Thud)

2364
01:23:33,709 --> 01:23:34,962
That was hard.

2365
01:23:35,178 --> 01:23:36,765
Good shot.

2366
01:23:37,020 --> 01:23:38,547
Good shot.

2367
01:23:38,548 --> 01:23:39,661
Good shot.

2368
01:23:39,888 --> 01:23:42,347
That must hurt.

2369
01:23:42,348 --> 01:23:44,019
- That was intense. - Ha Kyun controlled it.

2370
01:23:44,020 --> 01:23:45,473
Let's clap for him.

2371
01:23:46,060 --> 01:23:49,229
Today's winners are Yuims Bond and the Bond Girl.

2372
01:23:49,230 --> 01:23:52,329
(The race is over with the victory of Yuims Bond and the Bond Girl.)

2373
01:23:52,330 --> 01:23:54,855
(One day, everyone's name disappeared.)

2374
01:23:55,298 --> 01:23:57,939
(Nine new name tags)

2375
01:23:57,940 --> 01:23:59,960
(Another man searches his name.)

2376
01:24:00,240 --> 01:24:01,507
(This Person, That Person, That Person Afar)

2377
01:24:01,508 --> 01:24:03,779
(We cannot be called...)

2378
01:24:03,780 --> 01:24:05,728
(with names that we knew.)

2379
01:24:06,410 --> 01:24:08,024
(Recover your real name.)

2380
01:24:08,379 --> 01:24:10,642
(Where is my real name that I had all my life?)

2381
01:24:10,879 --> 01:24:12,779
(Unique and strange names come together.)

2382
01:24:12,780 --> 01:24:15,414
(Will the shoot be over if you give up and change your name?)

2383
01:24:15,950 --> 01:24:19,489
(Does someone else have my name?)

2384
01:24:19,490 --> 01:24:21,927
(It's a dangerous journey to retrieve their names again.)

2385
01:24:21,928 --> 01:24:24,625
(Who will stop being nameless?)

2386
01:24:25,999 --> 01:24:27,427
You guys are...

2387
01:24:27,428 --> 01:24:29,863
terrible.

2388
01:24:30,499 --> 01:24:32,419
("Your Name")
