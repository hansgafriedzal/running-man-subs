1
00:00:05,831 --> 00:00:08,070
- Hello. - Hi.

2
00:00:08,071 --> 00:00:10,709
- Hi. - Hello.

3
00:00:10,710 --> 00:00:11,709
(The show starts at an amusement park.)

4
00:00:11,710 --> 00:00:14,140
Jae Seok, are you trying to make us laugh with your outfit now?

5
00:00:14,141 --> 00:00:16,179
- I'm sorry. - Is it starting today?

6
00:00:16,180 --> 00:00:18,050
- What's wrong with your outfit? - Haha's outfit isn't ridiculous.

7
00:00:18,051 --> 00:00:20,397
- That's why I wore this. - I must've influenced your outfit.

8
00:00:20,450 --> 00:00:22,969
It was Oh Hyuk. Oh Hyuk influenced me.

9
00:00:23,551 --> 00:00:24,690
- I'm Yu Hyuk now. - What is this?

10
00:00:24,691 --> 00:00:26,850
- I'm Yu Hyuk. - My goodness.

11
00:00:26,851 --> 00:00:29,390
- Oh Hyuk and Yu Hyuk. - Come on, unbelievable.

12
00:00:29,391 --> 00:00:30,929
- I'm Oh Hyuk. - Okay, okay.

13
00:00:30,930 --> 00:00:32,530
(Jae Seok, let's go shopping together.)

14
00:00:32,531 --> 00:00:35,253
A newspaper agency ran a questionnaire recently.

15
00:00:35,700 --> 00:00:37,466
It was about leading celebrities of the Korean Wave.

16
00:00:38,070 --> 00:00:39,090
The first place went to...

17
00:00:39,530 --> 00:00:40,529
Jae Seok.

18
00:00:40,530 --> 00:00:41,723
(1st place of leading celebrity of Korean Wave, Yu Jae Seok)

19
00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:43,540
I knew it. Of course.

20
00:00:43,541 --> 00:00:45,172
- Yu Hyuk. - My gosh.

21
00:00:45,371 --> 00:00:47,239
- It's thanks to my colleagues. - That's right.

22
00:00:47,240 --> 00:00:48,279
It's all thanks to you.

23
00:00:48,280 --> 00:00:51,066
- Yu Hyuk. - Thank you.

24
00:00:51,350 --> 00:00:52,480
The second place went to...

25
00:00:52,481 --> 00:00:53,650
(The next leading celebrity is...)

26
00:00:53,651 --> 00:00:55,823
Lee Kwang Soo, comedian who used to be a model.

27
00:00:56,121 --> 00:00:58,150
- Me? - You should work hard now.

28
00:00:58,151 --> 00:01:00,349
- It's Kwang Soo. - Me?

29
00:01:00,350 --> 00:01:01,360
That's so cool.

30
00:01:01,361 --> 00:01:03,258
Great. Kwang Soo, the comedian got it.

31
00:01:03,320 --> 00:01:04,459
That's right.

32
00:01:04,460 --> 00:01:06,061
And Jong Kook was in fourth place.

33
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:07,930
This is so hot.

34
00:01:07,931 --> 00:01:10,277
- Three were from Running Man. - This is so cool.

35
00:01:10,660 --> 00:01:11,853
Are there any more?

36
00:01:12,371 --> 00:01:13,553
And...

37
00:01:14,041 --> 00:01:15,540
Look thoroughly. Look at the bottom.

38
00:01:15,541 --> 00:01:17,510
It's been 20 years since Seok Jin made his debut.

39
00:01:17,511 --> 00:01:19,072
Please take a close look at the list.

40
00:01:19,310 --> 00:01:22,439
- Good luck. - Let's do our best!

41
00:01:22,440 --> 00:01:24,109
(Let's do our best until the day Seok Jin rules Asia.)

42
00:01:24,110 --> 00:01:26,010
- We can do it! - Let's do our best.

43
00:01:26,011 --> 00:01:27,949
My gosh, Seok Jin...

44
00:01:27,950 --> 00:01:29,959
- didn't make it to the list. - You should check thoroughly.

45
00:01:30,021 --> 00:01:31,958
But he's the leading celebrity in riding coattails.

46
00:01:32,521 --> 00:01:34,219
He is the best leading celebrity in riding coattails.

47
00:01:34,220 --> 00:01:37,059
- He's barely riding the cattail. - I don't care what's I'm best for.

48
00:01:37,060 --> 00:01:38,790
I don't care what it is for as long as I'm in first place.

49
00:01:38,791 --> 00:01:41,559
You're barely making it. You barely made it to the coattail.

50
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:43,799
Before we start today's race,

51
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:45,930
you have gathered here today for a reason.

52
00:01:45,931 --> 00:01:48,828
- What is it? - The episode aired yesterday.

53
00:01:48,871 --> 00:01:50,939
It was because of the result for the most-searched words.

54
00:01:50,940 --> 00:01:52,510
- That's right. Right. - My gosh.

55
00:01:52,511 --> 00:01:53,531
(It's time to check the result.)

56
00:01:54,041 --> 00:01:57,480
(Their mission was to be the most-searched name online.)

57
00:01:57,481 --> 00:01:58,480
(With the support of popular guests such as...)

58
00:01:58,481 --> 00:02:00,756
(EXID, SEVENTEEN, Kim Hye Yoon, and Han Bo Reum,)

59
00:02:00,981 --> 00:02:05,049
(the race ended as Team Kim Hye Yoon won an additional keyword.)

60
00:02:05,050 --> 00:02:08,689
Two teams accomplished to go viral online.

61
00:02:08,690 --> 00:02:09,843
Who are they?

62
00:02:10,290 --> 00:02:11,529
Two teams?

63
00:02:11,530 --> 00:02:12,590
(Which 2 teams won 1st place?)

64
00:02:12,591 --> 00:02:15,659
The first team is Team Han Bo Reum.

65
00:02:15,660 --> 00:02:16,860
- Gosh. - Jong Kook.

66
00:02:16,861 --> 00:02:19,069
- Bo Reum kept trending up. - That's right.

67
00:02:19,070 --> 00:02:21,549
- It was Running Man Han Bo Reum. - Exactly.

68
00:02:21,701 --> 00:02:24,569
And the second team is Team Kim Hye Yoon.

69
00:02:24,570 --> 00:02:25,870
(Jae Seok and Kwang Soo were in 1st place of the list.)

70
00:02:25,871 --> 00:02:27,779
And Kim Hye Yoon also was in first place.

71
00:02:27,780 --> 00:02:29,279
- Right, right. - Yes!

72
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:31,148
Both the name of the team and her name topped the chart.

73
00:02:31,681 --> 00:02:33,050
Gosh, Hye Yoon.

74
00:02:33,051 --> 00:02:35,680
I bet people who didn't know who she was looked her up.

75
00:02:35,681 --> 00:02:38,403
Therefore, the final victory goes to...

76
00:02:38,790 --> 00:02:40,120
- It was long. - Bo Reum's name stayed there long.

77
00:02:40,121 --> 00:02:42,467
- Her name lasted a long time. - Her name was on the list for long.

78
00:02:42,491 --> 00:02:44,159
The word, Running Man Han Bo Reum...

79
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:45,289
(The duration in 1st place...)

80
00:02:45,290 --> 00:02:46,960
stayed in 1st place for 49 minutes.

81
00:02:46,961 --> 00:02:48,529
- 49 minutes? - That was long.

82
00:02:48,530 --> 00:02:49,529
It lasted a long time.

83
00:02:49,530 --> 00:02:51,430
And the duration for Running Man Kim Hye Yoon...

84
00:02:51,431 --> 00:02:53,599
- You combined them. - and Kim Hye Yoon...

85
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:55,039
- It lasted quite long. - They'll combine the names.

86
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:57,569
(The duration of the names in 1st place is...)

87
00:02:57,570 --> 00:03:01,039
- It's 29 minutes. - Really?

88
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:02,580
- Bo Reum stayed on the list long. - That long?

89
00:03:02,581 --> 00:03:04,518
She went viral for that long? My gosh.

90
00:03:04,651 --> 00:03:06,007
- Do we have a prize? - Yes!

91
00:03:06,581 --> 00:03:08,590
- She stayed there for a long time. - We were so close.

92
00:03:08,681 --> 00:03:10,120
All right.

93
00:03:10,121 --> 00:03:13,110
Here's what the teams except for the winning team will do.

94
00:03:13,220 --> 00:03:14,342
At this amusement park,

95
00:03:14,961 --> 00:03:17,319
- there's Jecheon's special ride... - My gosh.

96
00:03:17,320 --> 00:03:19,029
which is scarier than the pirate ship in Wolmi Island.

97
00:03:19,030 --> 00:03:21,159
- The ride is on your right. - The engine is ready.

98
00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:23,476
- We'll ride that? - I mean...

99
00:03:24,301 --> 00:03:27,430
(Forget about the pirate ships you've been on so far.)

100
00:03:27,431 --> 00:03:30,531
(The extreme angle of the pirate ship will test your guts.)

101
00:03:31,611 --> 00:03:34,610
(When the ship goes up, you'll see the door to the other side.)

102
00:03:34,611 --> 00:03:37,180
Is this one scarier than the one in Wolmi Island?

103
00:03:37,181 --> 00:03:40,309
I think they might pass out. They're going to pass out.

104
00:03:40,310 --> 00:03:43,520
However, only one team will be chosen to ride the ship.

105
00:03:43,521 --> 00:03:45,150
- Just one team? - That's great.

106
00:03:45,151 --> 00:03:46,650
Everyone, it's simple.

107
00:03:46,651 --> 00:03:48,219
You'll play the Ghost Leg.

108
00:03:48,220 --> 00:03:50,960
But we were able to go viral. Can you exclude us?

109
00:03:50,961 --> 00:03:54,091
- That's right. - Sadly, you won second place,

110
00:03:54,230 --> 00:03:56,059
- so we'll let you draw the lines. - That's great.

111
00:03:56,060 --> 00:03:57,460
- Okay, okay. - I'll let you do that.

112
00:03:57,461 --> 00:03:59,469
That's right. They had to win the whole thing.

113
00:03:59,470 --> 00:04:00,490
(I'm so jealous.)

114
00:04:01,201 --> 00:04:03,140
(They're designing the Ghost Leg seriously.)

115
00:04:03,141 --> 00:04:04,537
- Should we stop here? - Yes.

116
00:04:04,540 --> 00:04:05,770
- This is pretty good. - This is pretty good.

117
00:04:05,771 --> 00:04:07,409
You should add one of these.

118
00:04:07,410 --> 00:04:08,409
- You know what I'm talking about? - Right. Draw one more there.

119
00:04:08,410 --> 00:04:09,509
- You know what I'm talking about? - Right. Draw one more there.

120
00:04:09,510 --> 00:04:11,825
Draw one more since there's a lot of space there.

121
00:04:11,910 --> 00:04:14,021
- Here? - That's right. Just like that.

122
00:04:14,350 --> 00:04:16,150
- There you go. Do that. - Okay.

123
00:04:16,151 --> 00:04:17,950
- All right then. - My gosh.

124
00:04:17,951 --> 00:04:19,750
- I'll pick. I choose number two. - You're better than me.

125
00:04:19,751 --> 00:04:21,789
Number 2? Okay. We'll check number 2 first.

126
00:04:21,790 --> 00:04:23,390
- Please! - This is for Seok Jin and Haha.

127
00:04:23,391 --> 00:04:24,451
Please.

128
00:04:24,990 --> 00:04:28,366
(We're making our way down.)

129
00:04:29,901 --> 00:04:32,330
- Please, please. Please don't be. - Please.

130
00:04:32,331 --> 00:04:34,070
(Will they be able to dodge the penalty?)

131
00:04:34,071 --> 00:04:35,070
(What's the result?)

132
00:04:35,071 --> 00:04:36,440
- We passed. We passed! - "Pass".

133
00:04:36,441 --> 00:04:40,858
(Seok Jin and Haha will pass the pirate ship penalty.)

134
00:04:40,910 --> 00:04:42,920
- I knew it. - Did you see that?

135
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:44,750
I'm so happy.

136
00:04:44,751 --> 00:04:47,811
- Number 2 was good. Good. - Gosh, number 2 was the best.

137
00:04:48,620 --> 00:04:51,069
- It's your turn, Ji Hyo and So Min. - You should pick.

138
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:53,789
- Ji Hyo and So Min. - You get lucky with these things.

139
00:04:53,790 --> 00:04:56,260
- We'll go with number 3. - Number 3?

140
00:04:56,261 --> 00:04:58,130
(Lucky Ji Hyo chose number 3.)

141
00:04:58,131 --> 00:04:59,760
(All right! Number 3 is going down.)

142
00:04:59,761 --> 00:05:01,434
- It's number one. Please! Please! - No, no.

143
00:05:02,100 --> 00:05:03,159
Please, please.

144
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:05,170
(If they pass, Jae Seok and Kwang Soo will face the penalty.)

145
00:05:05,230 --> 00:05:07,000
(It's Lucky Lady versus Unlucky Brothers.)

146
00:05:07,001 --> 00:05:08,900
(Which team will face the penalty?)

147
00:05:08,901 --> 00:05:11,869
(Will Ji Hyo be able to get lucky this time too?)

148
00:05:11,870 --> 00:05:15,307
(Praise the Lady. Her luck will last forever!)

149
00:05:16,141 --> 00:05:17,609
- This is amazing. - How is this possible?

150
00:05:17,610 --> 00:05:18,810
I can't believe this.

151
00:05:18,811 --> 00:05:20,179
- Who are you? - Seriously.

152
00:05:20,180 --> 00:05:21,915
- This is so weird. - Why does it always happen to you?

153
00:05:22,180 --> 00:05:23,849
What's wrong with you?

154
00:05:23,850 --> 00:05:25,090
This is so weird.

155
00:05:25,091 --> 00:05:26,274
They are the 1st and 2nd leading celebrities...

156
00:05:26,451 --> 00:05:27,572
of the Korean Wave.

157
00:05:27,761 --> 00:05:29,159
- How is this possible? - This is crazy.

158
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:31,946
- They are in 1st and 2nd places. - They are in 1st and 2nd places.

159
00:05:32,261 --> 00:05:34,025
Go have fun, Jae Seok.

160
00:05:34,230 --> 00:05:36,630
My gosh, this is so stressful. Seriously.

161
00:05:36,631 --> 00:05:37,956
(This is so stressful. Seriously.)

162
00:05:38,430 --> 00:05:39,570
Hello.

163
00:05:39,571 --> 00:05:40,570
(They are devastated...)

164
00:05:40,571 --> 00:05:42,739
(while the other members are just laughing.)

165
00:05:42,740 --> 00:05:44,469
- They can't ride that. - Why not?

166
00:05:44,470 --> 00:05:45,561
Look at this.

167
00:05:45,711 --> 00:05:47,302
"Ugly people are not allowed to ride it."

168
00:05:47,980 --> 00:05:49,368
Hey, Jae Seok!

169
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:51,408
- Where? - You can't ride it.

170
00:05:51,550 --> 00:05:52,979
- Why not? - Both of you cannot.

171
00:05:52,980 --> 00:05:54,449
(If you're ugly, you can't ride the pirate ship.)

172
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:56,450
(There's hope of exemption at the end of their despair.)

173
00:05:56,451 --> 00:05:57,777
- What? - Ugly people can't ride it.

174
00:05:58,350 --> 00:05:59,719
- It only works for Jae Seok. - Both of you.

175
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:01,460
(They are under-qualified with their ugly looks.)

176
00:06:01,461 --> 00:06:03,663
Only Jae Seok can dodge this. What is this?

177
00:06:03,761 --> 00:06:04,960
You can't ride that.

178
00:06:04,961 --> 00:06:07,275
Hey, if you admit that you're ugly, you don't have to ride it.

179
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:09,929
That means you're uglier than Se Chan.

180
00:06:09,930 --> 00:06:12,570
(That means you're uglier than Se Chan.)

181
00:06:12,571 --> 00:06:15,936
(This is the biggest crisis ever since he's been branded as ugly.)

182
00:06:16,401 --> 00:06:19,369
(You can only dodge the ride if you're ugly.)

183
00:06:19,370 --> 00:06:20,710
(However,)

184
00:06:20,711 --> 00:06:24,510
(you must admit that you are uglier than Se Chan.)

185
00:06:24,511 --> 00:06:26,184
I can't believe that's a rule.

186
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:28,549
I can't be uglier than you, Se Chan.

187
00:06:28,550 --> 00:06:31,250
(He can't bear to be uglier than Se Chan.)

188
00:06:31,251 --> 00:06:32,989
(You must be uglier than me.)

189
00:06:32,990 --> 00:06:35,520
- Okay, I got it. - You look so handsome!

190
00:06:35,521 --> 00:06:37,703
- You look handsome. - They look down on me.

191
00:06:38,331 --> 00:06:40,432
Kwang Soo, what are we going to do?

192
00:06:41,461 --> 00:06:42,560
I'm going to throw up again.

193
00:06:42,561 --> 00:06:44,091
(It's his natural reaction to the pirate ship.)

194
00:06:44,370 --> 00:06:46,676
- That's for sure. - I'm going to throw up again.

195
00:06:47,201 --> 00:06:48,466
Why did you draw the last one?

196
00:06:49,201 --> 00:06:50,340
Why did you?

197
00:06:50,341 --> 00:06:52,369
I only drew the last one, but you drew the rest.

198
00:06:52,370 --> 00:06:53,739
(Jae Seok, we were both unlucky.)

199
00:06:53,740 --> 00:06:54,909
Hey.

200
00:06:54,910 --> 00:06:56,237
(Startled)

201
00:06:56,441 --> 00:06:58,210
(They were laughing.)

202
00:06:58,211 --> 00:07:00,190
(Terrified)

203
00:07:00,980 --> 00:07:03,880
(It suddenly begins without a warning.)

204
00:07:03,881 --> 00:07:05,217
- Hey, hey. That... - My gosh.

205
00:07:05,251 --> 00:07:07,230
- I feel nauseous just by watching. - This is a scary ride.

206
00:07:07,620 --> 00:07:09,260
Hey, it's going up high.

207
00:07:09,261 --> 00:07:10,311
It's...

208
00:07:10,620 --> 00:07:11,784
It's already...

209
00:07:12,860 --> 00:07:14,360
My bottom is already lifting.

210
00:07:14,631 --> 00:07:16,701
- My gosh. - It's going up really high.

211
00:07:17,230 --> 00:07:18,454
It's going to go up higher.

212
00:07:18,470 --> 00:07:20,169
My gosh, it's going up really high.

213
00:07:20,170 --> 00:07:21,169
(The pirate ship is slowly approaching the underworld.)

214
00:07:21,170 --> 00:07:22,394
Stop it. Stop it.

215
00:07:22,501 --> 00:07:23,664
Sir, this is enough.

216
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:24,869
I might throw up.

217
00:07:24,870 --> 00:07:26,640
- My gosh. - We're already going up high.

218
00:07:26,641 --> 00:07:28,578
- Kwang Soo! - We're already high up!

219
00:07:29,410 --> 00:07:31,450
- He's ugly. Why did he ride that? - Exactly.

220
00:07:31,881 --> 00:07:34,838
How did this happen to them when we played the Ghost Leg?

221
00:07:35,980 --> 00:07:38,349
(Their ugliness goes beyond Korea.)

222
00:07:38,350 --> 00:07:40,719
(Their ugly looks are definitely contenders for the ugliest looks.)

223
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:42,520
(Not everyone can become a comedian.)

224
00:07:42,521 --> 00:07:44,428
(You can be a leading celebrity of the Korean Wave with these looks.)

225
00:07:44,561 --> 00:07:46,359
(They are the best on variety shows.)

226
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:47,429
Their bodies are lifting.

227
00:07:47,430 --> 00:07:48,429
(The pirate ship is heading to the top.)

228
00:07:48,430 --> 00:07:50,400
- I'm dizzy. Stop. - I'm dizzy.

229
00:07:50,401 --> 00:07:52,614
- I'm dizzy. No! - No!

230
00:07:52,701 --> 00:07:53,700
Stop it.

231
00:07:53,701 --> 00:07:55,099
(To protect their looks, the ride will stop here.)

232
00:07:55,100 --> 00:07:56,191
I'm so dizzy.

233
00:07:56,370 --> 00:07:58,140
We're done. Gosh, we're done now.

234
00:07:58,141 --> 00:07:59,469
It's over now. Good job.

235
00:07:59,470 --> 00:08:02,010
(The pirate ship is over. Good job.)

236
00:08:02,011 --> 00:08:03,061
Well done.

237
00:08:03,711 --> 00:08:05,779
It doesn't mean that you're handsome because you rode it.

238
00:08:05,780 --> 00:08:06,810
(They carried out the penalty.)

239
00:08:06,811 --> 00:08:09,095
- It means you're not ugly. - They're not ugly.

240
00:08:09,850 --> 00:08:11,320
Everyone, today's special episode...

241
00:08:11,321 --> 00:08:13,390
will air on May 5 for the Children's Day.

242
00:08:13,391 --> 00:08:14,390
(Look forward to it.)

243
00:08:14,391 --> 00:08:15,615
It's Children's Day.

244
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:18,659
Recently, this guest has been filming a movie with children...

245
00:08:18,660 --> 00:08:21,659
and claims that he knows a way to the hearts of children.

246
00:08:22,331 --> 00:08:24,469
He has come back as an actor whose movie sold 16 million tickets.

247
00:08:24,470 --> 00:08:25,969
- I'll introduce today's guest. - Who is it?

248
00:08:25,970 --> 00:08:27,093
- 16 million tickets? - 16 million tickets?

249
00:08:27,131 --> 00:08:28,323
16 million tickets?

250
00:08:29,001 --> 00:08:32,670
- The carousel is turning. - Who is it?

251
00:08:32,671 --> 00:08:35,340
(When the carousel starts turning, the guest shows up.)

252
00:08:35,341 --> 00:08:38,050
(Who is today's guest?)

253
00:08:38,051 --> 00:08:39,102
- It's Dong Hwi. - Dong Hwi.

254
00:08:39,650 --> 00:08:40,670
Dong Hwi.

255
00:08:41,421 --> 00:08:42,780
("Extreme Job", 2nd highest-grossing movie)

256
00:08:42,781 --> 00:08:44,759
(The man of 16 million audience captivated Korea.)

257
00:08:45,490 --> 00:08:48,519
(His hobby is talking to himself.)

258
00:08:48,520 --> 00:08:49,820
(His special talent is looking at the camera.)

259
00:08:49,821 --> 00:08:53,060
(He's a mysterious man whose mind can't be read.)

260
00:08:53,061 --> 00:08:54,729
(This time, he's here as a solo guest.)

261
00:08:54,730 --> 00:08:56,430
(He returns as the man of 16 million audience.)

262
00:08:56,431 --> 00:08:58,817
- Dong Hwi. - You're the solo guest today.

263
00:08:58,831 --> 00:09:00,899
- Dong Hwi. - Did you come here alone now?

264
00:09:00,900 --> 00:09:02,999
- What an entrance. - Is he the only guest today?

265
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,399
You're the only guest now.

266
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:05,509
(He's on edge.)

267
00:09:05,510 --> 00:09:07,407
- Where is he going? - He passed us.

268
00:09:07,711 --> 00:09:09,410
He's the only guest today. My gosh.

269
00:09:09,411 --> 00:09:10,665
- Gosh. - Come here, Dong Hwi.

270
00:09:11,650 --> 00:09:12,977
- Hello. - Hi.

271
00:09:13,181 --> 00:09:15,019
I love this guy. He looks suspicious.

272
00:09:15,020 --> 00:09:16,050
Come to the center.

273
00:09:16,051 --> 00:09:18,119
- He just looks suspicious as he is. - Dong Hwi.

274
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:19,650
Jae Hoon, come here.

275
00:09:19,691 --> 00:09:20,711
Tak Jae Hoon?

276
00:09:20,890 --> 00:09:22,219
- You look just like him. - Right.

277
00:09:22,220 --> 00:09:23,546
- You look like him even more. - Seriously.

278
00:09:23,591 --> 00:09:24,783
Is he the only guest?

279
00:09:24,860 --> 00:09:26,290
- He's the only guest now. - He's the only guest?

280
00:09:26,291 --> 00:09:28,759
Recently, he was here for his movie, "Extreme Job".

281
00:09:28,760 --> 00:09:31,129
- He joined us in January. - Right.

282
00:09:31,130 --> 00:09:33,477
- I didn't know he'd be here alone. - Now, he's the only guest.

283
00:09:34,100 --> 00:09:35,099
It's an honor.

284
00:09:35,100 --> 00:09:36,773
Your movie, "My First Client",

285
00:09:36,970 --> 00:09:39,469
- will be released on May 22. - Yes.

286
00:09:39,470 --> 00:09:42,470
Our movie centers around an ordinary guy.

287
00:09:42,541 --> 00:09:44,950
After he faces an incident...

288
00:09:44,951 --> 00:09:46,109
Is it the way you talk?

289
00:09:46,110 --> 00:09:47,479
You're talking half-heartedly.

290
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:49,519
(You're not qualified to promote your movie.)

291
00:09:49,520 --> 00:09:51,389
- If you don't want to, don't. - No, no.

292
00:09:51,390 --> 00:09:52,519
- It's the tone. - If you don't want to, don't.

293
00:09:52,520 --> 00:09:54,960
- I'll try harder then. - Why don't you try to sound happy?

294
00:09:54,961 --> 00:09:56,185
Why don't you try to sound happy?

295
00:09:57,461 --> 00:10:00,560
Our movie centers around an ordinary guy.

296
00:10:00,561 --> 00:10:01,729
(Sounding energetic)

297
00:10:01,730 --> 00:10:03,060
I sound angry.

298
00:10:03,061 --> 00:10:04,999
But it doesn't look like you're giving your all here.

299
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,599
(I can see it in your face.)

300
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:08,639
That's what I see.

301
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:10,375
I mean, he works hard, but it doesn't look like it.

302
00:10:10,441 --> 00:10:12,348
It looks like he's being lazy.

303
00:10:12,470 --> 00:10:13,710
He has the face of a lazy guy.

304
00:10:13,711 --> 00:10:16,699
Everyone, today's special episode is for Children's Day.

305
00:10:17,380 --> 00:10:19,248
Today's race was designed...

306
00:10:19,610 --> 00:10:22,820
by the youngest writer, Lee Ha Neul, of Running Man's crew.

307
00:10:22,821 --> 00:10:23,979
- Really? - Really?

308
00:10:23,980 --> 00:10:25,785
- I'm curious. - What did she come up with?

309
00:10:25,821 --> 00:10:28,119
It's the Case of Missing Names.

310
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:30,610
(Children's Day Special Episode: the Case of Missing Names)

311
00:10:30,860 --> 00:10:31,960
- Missing names? - Missing names?

312
00:10:31,961 --> 00:10:33,259
(What does that mean?)

313
00:10:33,260 --> 00:10:34,359
The names are missing?

314
00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:37,900
Everyone, do you know how Children's Day came about?

315
00:10:38,031 --> 00:10:39,899
- Bang Jeong Hwan. - That's right.

316
00:10:39,900 --> 00:10:42,859
Back in the days, children weren't properly addressed.

317
00:10:42,941 --> 00:10:45,170
- "Baby", "youngster", - Really?

318
00:10:45,171 --> 00:10:47,440
or "kids". These were how they were called.

319
00:10:47,441 --> 00:10:48,609
the word, "child", didn't exist then.

320
00:10:48,610 --> 00:10:49,910
- It didn't. - Really?

321
00:10:49,911 --> 00:10:51,509
Bang Jeong Hwan came up with it.

322
00:10:51,510 --> 00:10:53,724
Bang Jeong Hwan found it sad they weren't properly addressed.

323
00:10:54,650 --> 00:10:56,620
He gave them a word for their entity, "child".

324
00:10:57,451 --> 00:11:00,920
To celebrate the day when they were recognized as separate entities,

325
00:11:00,921 --> 00:11:02,042
Children's Day was created.

326
00:11:02,091 --> 00:11:03,790
- I didn't know. - I had no idea.

327
00:11:03,791 --> 00:11:05,090
- I had no idea. - Seriously.

328
00:11:05,091 --> 00:11:07,889
Right now, all of your precious names...

329
00:11:07,890 --> 00:11:09,599
- are gone. - Who did that?

330
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:12,330
(The names of the members are missing.)

331
00:11:12,331 --> 00:11:13,861
- Our names? - Our names are missing?

332
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,295
- Again? - We don't have names?

333
00:11:15,441 --> 00:11:17,139
(Grabbing)

334
00:11:17,140 --> 00:11:18,160
It's you, right?

335
00:11:18,311 --> 00:11:20,070
- You're the culprit. - He's here for a reason.

336
00:11:20,071 --> 00:11:21,139
This is why you came.

337
00:11:21,140 --> 00:11:23,425
I'm sure they gave you a big role, the culprit.

338
00:11:23,911 --> 00:11:25,979
- There's no culprit today. - There isn't?

339
00:11:25,980 --> 00:11:28,050
- I'm sorry. - He's a victim too.

340
00:11:28,051 --> 00:11:29,407
- I'm sorry. - That's right.

341
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:31,989
- Sorry. - You'll break into three teams.

342
00:11:31,990 --> 00:11:35,190
The team that finds the names first will win.

343
00:11:35,191 --> 00:11:36,190
As teams?

344
00:11:36,191 --> 00:11:37,489
- We must find our names. - Everyone's names?

345
00:11:37,490 --> 00:11:39,673
All right. The team leaders for each team...

346
00:11:39,990 --> 00:11:42,347
will be the dads who know a lot about...

347
00:11:42,500 --> 00:11:43,599
how children feel.

348
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:44,769
(The Avengers of Fathers)

349
00:11:44,770 --> 00:11:47,330
Jae Seok, Seok Jin, and Haha will be the team leaders.

350
00:11:47,331 --> 00:11:49,513
- He's a dad. This is so weird. - Seok Jin.

351
00:11:50,041 --> 00:11:51,295
Actually,

352
00:11:51,411 --> 00:11:52,769
the youngest has 3 kids, I, 2, and the oldest, 1.

353
00:11:52,770 --> 00:11:53,969
- That's right. - 3, 2, 1.

354
00:11:53,970 --> 00:11:55,639
- Then, Seok Jin is at the bottom. - Right.

355
00:11:55,640 --> 00:11:56,979
- He's at the bottom. - Hey.

356
00:11:56,980 --> 00:11:58,450
- Say hello to them. - We'll use age.

357
00:11:58,451 --> 00:12:01,511
Attention, attention, attention.

358
00:12:01,581 --> 00:12:03,315
- What are you doing? - You're at the bottom. Attention.

359
00:12:04,120 --> 00:12:05,375
My goodness.

360
00:12:05,490 --> 00:12:07,119
You don't know anything about raising kids.

361
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:08,759
- Why don't I know that? - My gosh.

362
00:12:08,760 --> 00:12:10,320
- He knows nothing. - I teach my kid a lot.

363
00:12:10,321 --> 00:12:12,676
Seok Jin's wife raised his child all on her own.

364
00:12:12,990 --> 00:12:14,229
You're at the bottom. Attention.

365
00:12:14,230 --> 00:12:16,330
(Seok Jin is again riding his wife's coattail when raising their kid.)

366
00:12:16,331 --> 00:12:18,769
- Team leaders, come this way. - Okay.

367
00:12:18,770 --> 00:12:19,954
They're team leaders?

368
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,295
My gosh, I'm a team leader.

369
00:12:22,441 --> 00:12:23,840
It feels weird to see Haha with them.

370
00:12:23,841 --> 00:12:25,135
I can't believe I'm with them.

371
00:12:25,341 --> 00:12:26,666
How about this?

372
00:12:26,811 --> 00:12:28,718
- I would choose someone... - Okay.

373
00:12:28,740 --> 00:12:30,312
- How do you want him to turn out? - how I want my child...

374
00:12:30,911 --> 00:12:32,580
- to turn out. - That's the criteria?

375
00:12:32,581 --> 00:12:33,810
- How I want my child to grow up? - Right.

376
00:12:33,811 --> 00:12:35,019
Jae Seok, you have to choose me.

377
00:12:35,020 --> 00:12:36,072
My mouth is protruding.

378
00:12:36,220 --> 00:12:37,280
It has to be me.

379
00:12:37,281 --> 00:12:38,749
You have to pick me then.

380
00:12:38,850 --> 00:12:40,420
- You have to pick me. - You must choose him.

381
00:12:40,421 --> 00:12:41,820
- You must pick me. - You...

382
00:12:41,821 --> 00:12:43,359
- He's your son. - I made a mistake.

383
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:44,890
I shouldn't have said that.

384
00:12:44,990 --> 00:12:46,389
- I shouldn't have said that. - He's your son.

385
00:12:46,390 --> 00:12:48,339
- I shouldn't have said that. - Please find me, Dad.

386
00:12:49,031 --> 00:12:50,800
Let's play rock-paper-scissors.

387
00:12:50,801 --> 00:12:52,769
- Rock-paper-scissors - Rock-paper-scissors

388
00:12:52,900 --> 00:12:55,200
(Seok Jin loses.)

389
00:12:55,201 --> 00:12:56,570
- Rock-paper-scissors - You were so loud.

390
00:12:56,571 --> 00:12:58,304
- I wanted to win. - He was so loud.

391
00:12:58,941 --> 00:13:00,471
- Let's play it. Rock-paper-scissors - Rock-paper-scissors

392
00:13:01,581 --> 00:13:03,273
(Jae Seok wins.)

393
00:13:03,311 --> 00:13:04,410
It's Jae Seok.

394
00:13:04,411 --> 00:13:05,680
All right. Let's find my son.

395
00:13:05,681 --> 00:13:07,414
- It has to be me. - He's right there.

396
00:13:07,551 --> 00:13:08,704
That's your son.

397
00:13:09,020 --> 00:13:10,950
- Right. - Dong Hwi?

398
00:13:10,951 --> 00:13:14,690
I bet that Dong Hwi has a big clue today.

399
00:13:14,691 --> 00:13:15,759
Not at all.

400
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:19,160
- Okay, Dong Hwi. - Dong Hwi.

401
00:13:19,161 --> 00:13:20,558
- Okay. Dong Hwi. - Thank you.

402
00:13:21,130 --> 00:13:23,200
- Yes, this is understandable. - I chose Dong Hwi.

403
00:13:23,201 --> 00:13:25,005
Then, I have to be Haha's daughter.

404
00:13:25,130 --> 00:13:27,200
- Why? - I love daughters.

405
00:13:27,201 --> 00:13:28,399
- I want to have daughters. - What?

406
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:29,869
He's the coolest and the most handsome dad.

407
00:13:29,870 --> 00:13:31,645
- You're so pretty. - He is.

408
00:13:31,711 --> 00:13:33,440
If I want a daughter, I want a pretty daughter like you.

409
00:13:33,441 --> 00:13:35,551
- Dad. - Daughter.

410
00:13:36,211 --> 00:13:37,239
(Sighing)

411
00:13:37,240 --> 00:13:38,270
I have no choice.

412
00:13:38,350 --> 00:13:40,186
It's Children's Day. And she's young.

413
00:13:40,551 --> 00:13:41,672
So Min!

414
00:13:41,951 --> 00:13:43,755
- Come here. - I'm a kid.

415
00:13:43,880 --> 00:13:45,145
- Come here. - Dad.

416
00:13:45,451 --> 00:13:47,153
(Acting cute)

417
00:13:47,921 --> 00:13:49,216
- You're scary. - She's scary.

418
00:13:49,260 --> 00:13:51,259
My gosh, she was scary. She was scary.

419
00:13:51,260 --> 00:13:52,460
(It's Seok Jin's turn next.)

420
00:13:52,461 --> 00:13:53,889
- Seok Jin. - Me?

421
00:13:53,890 --> 00:13:55,462
You're not trying to get on my team.

422
00:13:56,130 --> 00:13:57,355
You're not trying.

423
00:13:57,400 --> 00:13:59,430
Jong Kook, why did you lower your head?

424
00:13:59,431 --> 00:14:01,070
- Look at Seok Jin. - My neck hurts.

425
00:14:01,071 --> 00:14:02,269
(Pushing him away)

426
00:14:02,270 --> 00:14:04,177
Why does it hurt all of a sudden?

427
00:14:04,541 --> 00:14:07,161
- Will knowing about kids help? - That's right.

428
00:14:07,171 --> 00:14:08,739
- Lee Kwang Soo! - Okay.

429
00:14:08,740 --> 00:14:10,475
(Lee Kwang Soo!)

430
00:14:10,781 --> 00:14:12,379
Did you just pick me?

431
00:14:12,380 --> 00:14:13,810
(In a daze)

432
00:14:13,811 --> 00:14:15,279
- Did you choose me? - Of course.

433
00:14:15,321 --> 00:14:17,320
- Yes, you must choose Kwang Soo. - He lowered his head.

434
00:14:17,321 --> 00:14:19,258
Here's what we'll do next.

435
00:14:19,321 --> 00:14:20,881
- There are six of us. - Okay.

436
00:14:21,191 --> 00:14:22,649
- They will choose their teams. - Okay.

437
00:14:23,091 --> 00:14:25,273
- They'll play rock-paper-scissors. - Play rock-paper-scissors.

438
00:14:25,831 --> 00:14:27,013
- Rock-paper-scissors - Rock-paper-scissors

439
00:14:27,961 --> 00:14:29,660
(Se Chan wins.)

440
00:14:29,661 --> 00:14:30,925
Okay. I won.

441
00:14:31,301 --> 00:14:32,869
Dad.

442
00:14:32,870 --> 00:14:34,880
(Dad)

443
00:14:35,941 --> 00:14:37,300
(The Protruding Father and Son meet again.)

444
00:14:37,301 --> 00:14:38,969
He's driving me crazy.

445
00:14:38,970 --> 00:14:41,215
- This is crazy. Goodness. - We have the same mouths.

446
00:14:41,510 --> 00:14:43,210
- Come on, seriously. - We have the same mouths.

447
00:14:43,211 --> 00:14:44,310
- Okay. - We have the same mouths.

448
00:14:44,311 --> 00:14:45,379
I'll...

449
00:14:45,380 --> 00:14:47,084
go to Haha's team to even out the genders.

450
00:14:47,581 --> 00:14:48,580
- I can do that, right? - I'll go to Seok Jin then.

451
00:14:48,581 --> 00:14:49,671
Okay!

452
00:14:49,880 --> 00:14:51,690
- Jong Kook! - Hey.

453
00:14:51,691 --> 00:14:53,119
- My gosh. - Two siblings that get along well.

454
00:14:53,650 --> 00:14:55,519
- This was bound to happen. - I tried so hard to dodge you.

455
00:14:55,520 --> 00:14:56,642
(The teams are formed.)

456
00:14:57,020 --> 00:14:59,000
And right now,

457
00:14:59,591 --> 00:15:01,743
- your names are missing. - Okay, okay.

458
00:15:01,860 --> 00:15:03,460
Until you retrieve your names,

459
00:15:03,461 --> 00:15:05,070
- you'll have temporary names... - Really?

460
00:15:05,071 --> 00:15:07,856
that you'll use as your name tags.

461
00:15:07,900 --> 00:15:09,040
They're not proper names.

462
00:15:09,041 --> 00:15:10,340
- What is this? - This doesn't feel good.

463
00:15:10,341 --> 00:15:11,440
No, it doesn't.

464
00:15:11,441 --> 00:15:13,109
I don't want to be called so.

465
00:15:13,110 --> 00:15:14,139
"This One", "The Other One", "That One".

466
00:15:14,140 --> 00:15:15,940
- "This Guy", "That Guy". - I like "Joe".

467
00:15:15,941 --> 00:15:17,009
- Yes. - Right.

468
00:15:17,010 --> 00:15:18,480
- You can take "Baby". - Okay.

469
00:15:18,551 --> 00:15:19,810
(She likes it more than her own name.)

470
00:15:19,811 --> 00:15:21,050
- Which one should I pick? - I like this.

471
00:15:21,051 --> 00:15:22,479
- I like this nickname. - You're Baby.

472
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:23,580
- "Child". - Yes.

473
00:15:23,581 --> 00:15:25,283
- I'll use this one. - Okay.

474
00:15:25,650 --> 00:15:26,950
Hold on. Which one should I pick?

475
00:15:26,951 --> 00:15:28,050
(Next is Team Jae Seok's turn.)

476
00:15:28,051 --> 00:15:29,619
- Do these. - We'll use these.

477
00:15:29,620 --> 00:15:31,190
- Don't. - We'll pick these.

478
00:15:31,191 --> 00:15:32,729
- Okay. - That's good.

479
00:15:32,730 --> 00:15:34,129
"This Guy", "That Guy", and "Hey, There" are left.

480
00:15:34,130 --> 00:15:35,425
(These are the remaining ones.)

481
00:15:35,561 --> 00:15:37,830
Kwang Soo can take "Hey, There."

482
00:15:37,831 --> 00:15:39,096
But...

483
00:15:40,571 --> 00:15:42,131
You should do "This Guy" and "That Guy".

484
00:15:42,571 --> 00:15:43,639
Hey, There.

485
00:15:43,640 --> 00:15:45,202
- "This Guy", "That Guy". - I hate being called this.

486
00:15:45,240 --> 00:15:46,944
- This Guy! - This Guy, That Guy!

487
00:15:47,041 --> 00:15:48,131
This Guy!

488
00:15:48,510 --> 00:15:50,340
- My gosh. - Feels like I'm a servant.

489
00:15:50,341 --> 00:15:51,680
I'm going crazy.

490
00:15:51,681 --> 00:15:53,893
(They pick their new names.)

491
00:15:54,811 --> 00:15:56,076
Baby!

492
00:15:56,650 --> 00:15:58,212
Baby is coming!

493
00:15:58,250 --> 00:15:59,749
Baby is here!

494
00:15:59,750 --> 00:16:00,889
Baby!

495
00:16:00,890 --> 00:16:02,287
(She's an old baby.)

496
00:16:02,520 --> 00:16:04,602
- Baby. - Yes?

497
00:16:04,791 --> 00:16:06,389
You're not "Babe", but "Baby".

498
00:16:06,390 --> 00:16:07,452
This Guy!

499
00:16:07,730 --> 00:16:08,800
This Guy!

500
00:16:08,801 --> 00:16:09,859
- Hey. - This Guy!

501
00:16:09,860 --> 00:16:11,595
- I was just calling you. - Hey.

502
00:16:11,801 --> 00:16:12,891
That Guy!

503
00:16:13,031 --> 00:16:14,269
He looks weak.

504
00:16:14,270 --> 00:16:15,769
(Scribbling)

505
00:16:16,301 --> 00:16:17,626
What did you write?

506
00:16:17,970 --> 00:16:19,739
(Jae Seok wrote something.)

507
00:16:19,740 --> 00:16:20,893
- What is it? - He wrote something.

508
00:16:21,341 --> 00:16:22,379
(So Min used to be called Baby.)

509
00:16:22,380 --> 00:16:23,810
- He changed your name to Gill. - It's Gill.

510
00:16:23,811 --> 00:16:25,279
- Gill. - Gill.

511
00:16:25,551 --> 00:16:26,649
He's so mischievous.

512
00:16:26,650 --> 00:16:27,879
He is.

513
00:16:27,880 --> 00:16:28,979
What about mine?

514
00:16:28,980 --> 00:16:29,979
- Petty man. - Petty man.

515
00:16:29,980 --> 00:16:32,540
(It suits him better than "Child".)

516
00:16:33,350 --> 00:16:34,513
Petty man?

517
00:16:35,390 --> 00:16:36,389
That's perfect.

518
00:16:36,390 --> 00:16:37,660
I'm Child.

519
00:16:37,661 --> 00:16:39,568
This upsets me all of a sudden.

520
00:16:39,691 --> 00:16:41,669
Okay. This game is...

521
00:16:41,760 --> 00:16:44,229
a traditional game called The Aging Game.

522
00:16:44,230 --> 00:16:46,170
(The Aging Game)

523
00:16:46,171 --> 00:16:47,200
(The Aging Game?)

524
00:16:47,201 --> 00:16:49,078
- The Aging Game? - Seok Jin has the upper hand.

525
00:16:49,240 --> 00:16:50,639
(It's the best game for him.)

526
00:16:50,640 --> 00:16:51,869
- I know. - He's already...

527
00:16:51,870 --> 00:16:52,869
- old. - He's aging.

528
00:16:52,870 --> 00:16:54,442
He doesn't have the upper hand.

529
00:16:54,470 --> 00:16:56,582
He can't get any older.

530
00:16:56,781 --> 00:16:57,910
You can't!

531
00:16:57,911 --> 00:16:59,050
(Do I really have the upper hand?)

532
00:16:59,051 --> 00:17:01,734
- You'll play at the same time. - Okay.

533
00:17:01,850 --> 00:17:03,780
From this moment on,

534
00:17:03,781 --> 00:17:05,218
you're all five-year-olds.

535
00:17:05,591 --> 00:17:06,750
I'm five!

536
00:17:06,751 --> 00:17:09,359
I'm five! So Min is five.

537
00:17:09,360 --> 00:17:10,389
- Seok Jin... - Seok Jin...

538
00:17:10,390 --> 00:17:11,560
reacted to being five years old,

539
00:17:11,561 --> 00:17:13,090
but no one responded.

540
00:17:13,091 --> 00:17:14,659
He didn't look cute at all.

541
00:17:14,660 --> 00:17:15,859
I'm five.

542
00:17:15,860 --> 00:17:17,760
- No one responded. - I'm five years of age.

543
00:17:17,761 --> 00:17:18,970
"Five years of age"?

544
00:17:18,971 --> 00:17:20,070
- 5 years of age! - 5 years of age.

545
00:17:20,071 --> 00:17:22,141
- He is five years old. - I am.

546
00:17:22,170 --> 00:17:23,699
Since the opening scene,

547
00:17:23,700 --> 00:17:25,840
Seok Jin kept nudging me towards Ji Hyo.

548
00:17:25,841 --> 00:17:27,504
Is it because she's sick?

549
00:17:28,041 --> 00:17:29,580
He dragged me.

550
00:17:29,581 --> 00:17:30,740
Come on.

551
00:17:30,741 --> 00:17:32,349
- It's because she's sick, right? - You're...

552
00:17:32,350 --> 00:17:34,209
- too harsh. - He's been doing that all along.

553
00:17:34,210 --> 00:17:35,449
This Guy and That Guy...

554
00:17:35,450 --> 00:17:37,490
- are impossible. - What?

555
00:17:38,221 --> 00:17:39,990
- My gosh. - Not me, though.

556
00:17:39,991 --> 00:17:41,590
- You're both impossible. - Not me!

557
00:17:41,591 --> 00:17:42,590
Hey, There.

558
00:17:42,591 --> 00:17:43,659
- I'm just... - You're impossible.

559
00:17:43,660 --> 00:17:45,730
- "Impossible" should be a name. - Come on.

560
00:17:45,731 --> 00:17:46,959
- It's not like that. - I know.

561
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:48,359
- Gosh. - That's too harsh.

562
00:17:48,360 --> 00:17:49,429
(We'll be nicer.)

563
00:17:49,430 --> 00:17:51,869
Okay. You have 10 minutes.

564
00:17:51,870 --> 00:17:53,360
- 10? - Yes.

565
00:17:53,471 --> 00:17:55,939
In the given time, the team that has...

566
00:17:55,940 --> 00:17:57,899
the oldest age accumulated wins.

567
00:17:57,900 --> 00:17:59,399
Okay. How do we age?

568
00:17:59,471 --> 00:18:02,810
You can touch the opponent who is younger than you.

569
00:18:02,811 --> 00:18:04,609
If you're the same age,

570
00:18:04,610 --> 00:18:06,349
play rock-paper-scissors and win.

571
00:18:06,350 --> 00:18:08,050
In these cases, you'll gain five years.

572
00:18:08,051 --> 00:18:09,856
But let's say your opponent...

573
00:18:09,950 --> 00:18:11,419
is older than you.

574
00:18:11,420 --> 00:18:12,919
If you hold hands with your teammate,

575
00:18:12,920 --> 00:18:14,318
your ages will be added.

576
00:18:14,850 --> 00:18:16,359
However,

577
00:18:16,360 --> 00:18:17,990
both of you who have won or lost...

578
00:18:17,991 --> 00:18:19,889
need to go home and tell your moms about it.

579
00:18:19,890 --> 00:18:21,859
- We need to touch them? - That's how it gets recorded.

580
00:18:21,860 --> 00:18:24,300
There are rabbits tied to the poles.

581
00:18:24,301 --> 00:18:26,882
(Their rabbit moms are waiting.)

582
00:18:27,031 --> 00:18:29,439
There's a way...

583
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:30,939
- to turn the tables. - What is it?

584
00:18:30,940 --> 00:18:34,169
If your opponent touches your house,

585
00:18:34,170 --> 00:18:36,109
their age will double.

586
00:18:36,110 --> 00:18:39,580
(The one who touches someone else's house will double their age.)

587
00:18:39,581 --> 00:18:41,409
We shouldn't let them get near our house then.

588
00:18:41,410 --> 00:18:43,460
- You need to defend. - Someone needs to stay behind.

589
00:18:43,721 --> 00:18:46,648
If the defender touches you during your attempt,

590
00:18:46,751 --> 00:18:48,220
- your age will become zero. - Okay.

591
00:18:48,221 --> 00:18:49,413
Your age becomes zero.

592
00:18:50,021 --> 00:18:52,030
Then we can be aggressive, right?

593
00:18:52,430 --> 00:18:54,030
But if we touch you near our house,

594
00:18:54,031 --> 00:18:55,629
we will take your age.

595
00:18:55,630 --> 00:18:57,300
How about we touch you like this?

596
00:18:57,301 --> 00:18:59,207
- Hold on. - What will you do about it?

597
00:18:59,301 --> 00:19:00,470
Touch.

598
00:19:00,471 --> 00:19:01,939
(Touch)

599
00:19:01,940 --> 00:19:03,399
(They will get beaten up.)

600
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:04,399
- Joe. - Hey.

601
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:06,740
- Joe. - This was not the touch we meant.

602
00:19:06,741 --> 00:19:08,098
This is...

603
00:19:08,271 --> 00:19:09,739
This is for Children's Day.

604
00:19:10,811 --> 00:19:12,687
- This is for Children's Day. - That's not the touch we meant.

605
00:19:13,251 --> 00:19:14,480
Joe!

606
00:19:14,481 --> 00:19:16,220
- That's quick. - You can't do that.

607
00:19:16,221 --> 00:19:17,780
- You're fast. - We can do that?

608
00:19:17,781 --> 00:19:19,119
- Okay. - Fine.

609
00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:20,549
(I'll get aggressive too.)

610
00:19:21,150 --> 00:19:23,099
(Joe is ready to go.)

611
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:24,820
The winning team...

612
00:19:24,821 --> 00:19:27,381
will get four syllables of their names back.

613
00:19:27,791 --> 00:19:29,659
One of us will get our name back.

614
00:19:29,660 --> 00:19:30,659
You're right.

615
00:19:30,660 --> 00:19:31,760
- You get it, right? - However,

616
00:19:31,761 --> 00:19:35,167
if the syllables you've picked...

617
00:19:35,301 --> 00:19:37,851
are also in your opponents' names, they'll retrieve them as well.

618
00:19:38,001 --> 00:19:40,310
For example, let's say that Team Jae Seok won...

619
00:19:40,311 --> 00:19:41,840
- and picked "Seok". - Seok Jin.

620
00:19:41,841 --> 00:19:43,166
Then Seok Jin will also get a "Seok".

621
00:19:43,210 --> 00:19:44,379
Really?

622
00:19:44,380 --> 00:19:45,409
- That's not good. - No, it isn't.

623
00:19:45,410 --> 00:19:46,609
"Lee" isn't good either.

624
00:19:46,610 --> 00:19:47,835
- There's Lee Kwang Soo. - You're right.

625
00:19:47,910 --> 00:19:49,614
- I don't overlap with anyone. - He doesn't have one either.

626
00:19:49,721 --> 00:19:51,220
Our last names don't overlap.

627
00:19:51,221 --> 00:19:53,842
- You're right. - Our last names don't overlap.

628
00:19:54,091 --> 00:19:55,895
Except for the winning team,

629
00:19:55,960 --> 00:19:58,560
all of those who haven't yet find their full names...

630
00:19:58,561 --> 00:19:59,560
will be penalized.

631
00:19:59,561 --> 00:20:00,612
What?

632
00:20:00,930 --> 00:20:03,530
- Then within your team... - It's a competition.

633
00:20:03,531 --> 00:20:05,775
- All right. Please spread out. - Let's go.

634
00:20:05,831 --> 00:20:07,629
- Where should we go? - Let's go to our house!

635
00:20:07,630 --> 00:20:09,334
We need to win at rock-paper-scissors.

636
00:20:09,971 --> 00:20:10,970
(They start off at their respective houses.)

637
00:20:10,971 --> 00:20:13,070
This is a serious game. It's frightening.

638
00:20:13,071 --> 00:20:14,233
(Team This One, Team This Guy, Team Child)

639
00:20:14,311 --> 00:20:17,209
Jae Seok, one person needs to be on defense.

640
00:20:17,210 --> 00:20:18,302
You're right.

641
00:20:18,341 --> 00:20:19,750
Dong Hwi, do you want to do it?

642
00:20:19,751 --> 00:20:20,750
I can do whatever.

643
00:20:20,751 --> 00:20:22,108
Then you can go out there.

644
00:20:22,350 --> 00:20:24,849
- We need to take turns anyway. - Right.

645
00:20:24,850 --> 00:20:25,849
(Jae Seok will defend while the others attack.)

646
00:20:25,850 --> 00:20:28,090
- Then... - I'll stay. I need to guard here.

647
00:20:28,091 --> 00:20:30,507
Right. If we win once,

648
00:20:30,660 --> 00:20:32,389
we'll be able to conquer this field.

649
00:20:32,390 --> 00:20:33,959
- We need to hurry. - The sum of our ages is big.

650
00:20:33,960 --> 00:20:35,330
- Okay. - So go attack.

651
00:20:35,331 --> 00:20:36,399
(Okay, let's do this.)

652
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:37,429
Let me tie my shoelaces first.

653
00:20:37,430 --> 00:20:39,030
Since that's too far,

654
00:20:39,031 --> 00:20:40,296
- we'll attack that one. - That one.

655
00:20:40,630 --> 00:20:41,629
That one?

656
00:20:41,630 --> 00:20:43,699
If you and I hold hands, we're 10 years old.

657
00:20:43,700 --> 00:20:44,770
(They plan to target Team This Guy that is closer.)

658
00:20:44,771 --> 00:20:46,570
If we hold hands and attack, we'll win for sure.

659
00:20:46,571 --> 00:20:49,709
- We need to attack as a team first. - Right.

660
00:20:49,710 --> 00:20:51,209
- Okay. - It's better than anything.

661
00:20:51,511 --> 00:20:53,409
Someone needs to stay behind to guard here.

662
00:20:53,410 --> 00:20:54,849
Let's take turns.

663
00:20:54,850 --> 00:20:55,941
Sure.

664
00:20:56,781 --> 00:20:58,349
You need to run a bit first.

665
00:20:58,350 --> 00:20:59,779
You're the most likely to succeed.

666
00:21:00,321 --> 00:21:02,227
So catch one of them.

667
00:21:02,261 --> 00:21:03,859
- What? - The first rock-paper-scissors...

668
00:21:03,860 --> 00:21:05,859
- is very important. - You just want to stay behind.

669
00:21:05,860 --> 00:21:07,665
(Ji Hyo is sharp.)

670
00:21:07,791 --> 00:21:09,030
No, that's not it.

671
00:21:09,031 --> 00:21:10,152
This Guy.

672
00:21:10,660 --> 00:21:12,429
Don't call me that when it's just us.

673
00:21:12,430 --> 00:21:14,205
- This Guy. - This punk.

674
00:21:14,630 --> 00:21:16,300
- What did you say? - Enough.

675
00:21:16,301 --> 00:21:17,340
That Guy.

676
00:21:17,341 --> 00:21:18,970
(Their teamwork crumbles from the start.)

677
00:21:18,971 --> 00:21:19,991
Do you want to just give up?

678
00:21:20,710 --> 00:21:22,580
- What do you mean? - No.

679
00:21:22,581 --> 00:21:23,740
- Hey, That Guy. - We can't give up.

680
00:21:23,741 --> 00:21:24,980
You punk.

681
00:21:24,981 --> 00:21:27,109
- The countdown will start now. - Let's go!

682
00:21:27,110 --> 00:21:29,324
- Get ready. - Let's go!

683
00:21:29,521 --> 00:21:31,183
That team is going the same way.

684
00:21:31,551 --> 00:21:32,590
Should I stay behind?

685
00:21:32,591 --> 00:21:34,320
- No, you can come out this much. - Then...

686
00:21:34,321 --> 00:21:37,013
- It's too far. - They might run towards us.

687
00:21:37,221 --> 00:21:38,859
They're coming towards us.

688
00:21:38,860 --> 00:21:41,136
- Let's protect this. Touch this. - They're coming.

689
00:21:41,460 --> 00:21:42,725
Why are they coming?

690
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:44,898
- Why are they coming? - We just need to touch this.

691
00:21:46,170 --> 00:21:47,800
One of them...

692
00:21:47,801 --> 00:21:49,504
They need to do rock-paper-scissors anyway.

693
00:21:50,041 --> 00:21:51,223
Let's go.

694
00:21:52,241 --> 00:21:53,770
They plan to hold hands.

695
00:21:53,771 --> 00:21:54,933
- Do you want to catch them? - Let's do that.

696
00:21:55,110 --> 00:21:57,010
- Hey. - We have the same plan.

697
00:21:57,011 --> 00:21:58,132
(They all thought the same.)

698
00:21:58,281 --> 00:21:59,909
No, wait a bit.

699
00:21:59,910 --> 00:22:01,179
If we all hold hands,

700
00:22:01,180 --> 00:22:02,752
- we'll catch them. - Right.

701
00:22:03,350 --> 00:22:04,419
We just need to hold hands.

702
00:22:04,420 --> 00:22:06,090
If they all hold hands,

703
00:22:06,091 --> 00:22:07,346
- we'll lose. - Right?

704
00:22:08,021 --> 00:22:09,347
We'll lose.

705
00:22:09,960 --> 00:22:11,760
But since So Min is slow,

706
00:22:11,761 --> 00:22:13,597
we can run away from them if they try to hold hands.

707
00:22:14,991 --> 00:22:17,599
We'll walk this way and then dash to the left.

708
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:18,629
To the left.

709
00:22:18,630 --> 00:22:20,899
Get ready. Come with me. Let's go.

710
00:22:20,900 --> 00:22:24,369
(They run towards Team This Guy's house.)

711
00:22:25,771 --> 00:22:26,791
They're coming.

712
00:22:27,140 --> 00:22:28,741
Our house is guarded, though.

713
00:22:29,041 --> 00:22:30,540
- Ji Hyo, guard our house. - She's guarding it.

714
00:22:30,541 --> 00:22:32,957
(As long as she's touching it, they have the upper hand.)

715
00:22:33,011 --> 00:22:34,280
They're coming here.

716
00:22:34,281 --> 00:22:35,419
(They plan to counterattack.)

717
00:22:35,420 --> 00:22:37,419
- Grab them! - We need to grab hands!

718
00:22:38,581 --> 00:22:41,490
(Meanwhile, Team Child's house is unguarded.)

719
00:22:41,491 --> 00:22:44,826
(While running away, Dong Hwi heads towards the house.)

720
00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:46,129
Let's go.

721
00:22:46,130 --> 00:22:48,273
(Our house is in danger!)

722
00:22:48,390 --> 00:22:50,359
Wait! Two of us won't make it!

723
00:22:50,360 --> 00:22:51,380
(Team Child returns back home.)

724
00:22:51,501 --> 00:22:52,599
We need to run!

725
00:22:52,600 --> 00:22:54,099
(Come here.)

726
00:22:54,100 --> 00:22:55,129
(Joe is here! Let's run away!)

727
00:22:55,130 --> 00:22:56,498
Jae Seok, guard our house.

728
00:22:57,541 --> 00:22:58,599
Those punks.

729
00:22:58,600 --> 00:22:59,691
(How dare they?)

730
00:23:00,771 --> 00:23:02,852
Gosh, I'm already exhausted.

731
00:23:03,311 --> 00:23:04,340
Are you all right?

732
00:23:04,341 --> 00:23:05,609
I ran for a brief moment.

733
00:23:05,610 --> 00:23:07,895
(He's completely out of energy.)

734
00:23:07,981 --> 00:23:09,042
Shall we go again?

735
00:23:10,380 --> 00:23:12,290
I'll go over there.

736
00:23:12,291 --> 00:23:13,919
- Don't lie. - Se Chan is behind you.

737
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:15,389
- Don't lie. - He's behind you.

738
00:23:15,390 --> 00:23:17,461
- Move away! - Shall we have a match?

739
00:23:17,591 --> 00:23:18,815
You have to touch this.

740
00:23:18,890 --> 00:23:20,129
- Let's touch Haha. - Behind you!

741
00:23:20,130 --> 00:23:21,689
(How dare they target our house?)

742
00:23:21,690 --> 00:23:22,985
We can just pick one.

743
00:23:23,331 --> 00:23:25,135
(They target Haha.)

744
00:23:25,731 --> 00:23:27,530
(They're both the same age now. They should do rock-paper-scissors.)

745
00:23:27,531 --> 00:23:28,693
Rock-paper-scissors?

746
00:23:29,241 --> 00:23:30,840
(He attempts to touch Kwang Soo...)

747
00:23:30,841 --> 00:23:32,369
(but fails.)

748
00:23:32,370 --> 00:23:33,595
Seok Jin! Hurry!

749
00:23:33,741 --> 00:23:34,869
Seok Jin!

750
00:23:34,870 --> 00:23:35,939
Should we go together?

751
00:23:35,940 --> 00:23:37,379
(Seok Jin needs to come to win.)

752
00:23:37,380 --> 00:23:39,050
(However, it's That One and The Other One.)

753
00:23:39,051 --> 00:23:40,071
Get lost.

754
00:23:40,311 --> 00:23:41,942
- We can catch one of them. - Right.

755
00:23:42,180 --> 00:23:44,393
(They go on a hunt as a team.)

756
00:23:45,251 --> 00:23:47,392
(No matter how much Kwang Soo cries out, Seok Jin stays behind.)

757
00:23:47,890 --> 00:23:50,459
- Should we go together? - Hurry up and help him!

758
00:23:50,460 --> 00:23:51,888
- We can catch him. - Get lost.

759
00:23:52,291 --> 00:23:53,290
Touch!

760
00:23:53,291 --> 00:23:54,959
(They touch Kwang Soo.)

761
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:56,260
- We did it. - We touched Kwang Soo!

762
00:23:56,261 --> 00:23:57,830
(Dong Hwi and Se Chan successfully touch him.)

763
00:23:57,831 --> 00:23:59,300
- We touched him. - We touched Kwang Soo.

764
00:23:59,301 --> 00:24:00,525
Let's go back over there.

765
00:24:01,531 --> 00:24:02,826
Why didn't you come?

766
00:24:03,140 --> 00:24:04,425
Why didn't you?

767
00:24:05,041 --> 00:24:06,109
(They each gain 5 years.)

768
00:24:06,110 --> 00:24:08,181
Hold on. Let me go.

769
00:24:09,511 --> 00:24:10,540
Good job.

770
00:24:10,541 --> 00:24:11,580
(He has exhausted all his energy.)

771
00:24:11,581 --> 00:24:12,580
Jae Seok.

772
00:24:12,581 --> 00:24:14,080
(Trudging)

773
00:24:15,180 --> 00:24:16,879
- Come here. - Jae Seok.

774
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:17,879
We need to tell her.

775
00:24:17,880 --> 00:24:19,389
- Right. - Tell Mom.

776
00:24:19,390 --> 00:24:20,590
- Mom. - Mom.

777
00:24:20,591 --> 00:24:22,619
- What was my name again? - It's That One and The Other One.

778
00:24:22,620 --> 00:24:24,324
- Mom. - Mom, we...

779
00:24:24,660 --> 00:24:26,262
- caught that punk. - We touched...

780
00:24:26,390 --> 00:24:27,819
- that punk. - Good job.

781
00:24:27,890 --> 00:24:29,330
We're 25 years old now.

782
00:24:29,331 --> 00:24:30,830
- That's great. - We're invincible.

783
00:24:30,831 --> 00:24:31,899
(Team This One is 25 years old in total.)

784
00:24:31,900 --> 00:24:32,970
(They now have the upper hand.)

785
00:24:32,971 --> 00:24:34,570
- We're older now. - Yes.

786
00:24:34,571 --> 00:24:36,947
Dong Hwi, you look very pale.

787
00:24:37,571 --> 00:24:39,202
- Are you all right? - This is only the beginning.

788
00:24:39,710 --> 00:24:40,792
I'm...

789
00:24:40,841 --> 00:24:41,891
Can I make it?

790
00:24:42,311 --> 00:24:43,709
- Seok Jin. - Go, Seok Jin.

791
00:24:43,710 --> 00:24:44,939
Why didn't you come...

792
00:24:44,940 --> 00:24:46,174
- when I asked for you? - I was...

793
00:24:46,281 --> 00:24:47,480
I was guarding our house.

794
00:24:47,481 --> 00:24:49,220
Come to your senses, will you?

795
00:24:49,221 --> 00:24:50,419
- You... - This is not the time...

796
00:24:50,420 --> 00:24:51,980
- to joke around. - You only looked that way.

797
00:24:51,981 --> 00:24:54,541
- They were creeping up behind you. - You can't stay behind.

798
00:24:56,261 --> 00:24:58,090
- They're both 10 years old, right? - Yes.

799
00:24:58,091 --> 00:24:59,090
Yes.

800
00:24:59,091 --> 00:25:00,429
If they hold hands, they're 20.

801
00:25:00,430 --> 00:25:03,011
Even if the three of us hold hands, we won't make it.

802
00:25:03,400 --> 00:25:04,788
- Let's go. - Let's go.

803
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:06,399
- Let's go. - Guard it.

804
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:07,599
(Let's form an alliance.)

805
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:08,754
Let's attack together.

806
00:25:08,900 --> 00:25:10,165
Let's do this.

807
00:25:10,971 --> 00:25:12,740
Let's do rock-paper-scissors and let one person win.

808
00:25:12,741 --> 00:25:14,740
- Let's do it. - Okay, come here.

809
00:25:14,741 --> 00:25:16,510
- Hurry. - Let's meet halfway.

810
00:25:16,511 --> 00:25:17,810
- Come. - Hold hands.

811
00:25:17,811 --> 00:25:18,980
Let's do it.

812
00:25:18,981 --> 00:25:21,449
If they come, we need to run.

813
00:25:21,450 --> 00:25:23,318
- Really? - Yes, we need to hurry.

814
00:25:23,581 --> 00:25:25,631
- Rock-paper-scissors. - You want to do it?

815
00:25:25,791 --> 00:25:27,189
- Hurry. - They're 10 years old.

816
00:25:27,190 --> 00:25:28,720
It's okay if we form an alliance...

817
00:25:28,721 --> 00:25:30,090
(They form an alliance.)

818
00:25:30,091 --> 00:25:31,689
(However)

819
00:25:31,690 --> 00:25:32,790
- Okay. - We did it.

820
00:25:32,791 --> 00:25:34,330
(Kwang Soo suddenly runs away.)

821
00:25:34,331 --> 00:25:35,330
- Hey. - Hey, he let go.

822
00:25:35,331 --> 00:25:37,500
- We won! He let go! - You let go!

823
00:25:37,501 --> 00:25:39,203
- You let go! - Touch.

824
00:25:39,301 --> 00:25:41,199
(Kwang Soo touches their house.)

825
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:42,730
No, we won.

826
00:25:43,541 --> 00:25:46,295
- Seok Jin and I high-fived. - We...

827
00:25:46,370 --> 00:25:47,971
But Kwang Soo let go and ran.

828
00:25:48,110 --> 00:25:49,439
Then we all get...

829
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:50,909
- 5 years more. - We're 10 years old now.

830
00:25:50,910 --> 00:25:51,980
You touched him?

831
00:25:51,981 --> 00:25:53,235
(Here's what happened.)

832
00:25:53,450 --> 00:25:54,750
It's okay if we form an alliance...

833
00:25:54,751 --> 00:25:57,879
(Before they high-fived, Kwang Soo let go.)

834
00:25:57,880 --> 00:26:02,073
(Since it was 10 versus 15, Team Child received 5 years each.)

835
00:26:02,491 --> 00:26:03,619
What happened?

836
00:26:03,620 --> 00:26:04,859
(He helped the other team.)

837
00:26:04,860 --> 00:26:05,911
We're a minus now.

838
00:26:05,991 --> 00:26:07,330
- What? - We're a minus.

839
00:26:07,331 --> 00:26:09,951
- Why? - Because it was the three of them.

840
00:26:10,430 --> 00:26:11,599
I didn't think they would touch us.

841
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:13,845
(Team This Guy is 20 years old.)

842
00:26:14,071 --> 00:26:15,800
- I can walk alone now. - Me too.

843
00:26:15,801 --> 00:26:17,869
- I have nothing to fear. - They might not know.

844
00:26:17,870 --> 00:26:20,439
- They don't know. - They might not know.

845
00:26:20,440 --> 00:26:21,798
Did you win?

846
00:26:22,311 --> 00:26:23,738
- I don't know. - You don't?

847
00:26:23,811 --> 00:26:25,270
I don't think they won.

848
00:26:26,311 --> 00:26:27,810
I have nothing to fear now, right?

849
00:26:27,811 --> 00:26:29,050
Yes, we're all the same age.

850
00:26:29,051 --> 00:26:30,619
But if they hold hands, we'll lose.

851
00:26:30,620 --> 00:26:32,181
- That's true. - You're right.

852
00:26:32,251 --> 00:26:33,678
Se Chan, come here.

853
00:26:34,051 --> 00:26:35,244
How old is So Min?

854
00:26:35,420 --> 00:26:37,195
- She's 5. - 5?

855
00:26:37,521 --> 00:26:40,359
Hurry up. Come here.

856
00:26:40,360 --> 00:26:42,599
(Se Chan, who's 10, approaches her.)

857
00:26:42,600 --> 00:26:44,159
You don't have to run. You can do rock-paper-scissors.

858
00:26:44,160 --> 00:26:45,629
Let's play rock-paper-scissors.

859
00:26:45,801 --> 00:26:48,530
- How old are you? - Let's do it.

860
00:26:48,531 --> 00:26:50,917
Come here. They shouldn't hold hands.

861
00:26:51,400 --> 00:26:53,002
- They're younger than us. - Yes.

862
00:26:53,640 --> 00:26:55,201
How old are you?

863
00:26:55,370 --> 00:26:57,010
- 5. - You're 10, right?

864
00:26:57,011 --> 00:26:59,109
- I know you're both 10. - No, we're 5.

865
00:26:59,110 --> 00:27:00,280
(Being the same age, they have a match.)

866
00:27:00,281 --> 00:27:01,709
- Touch. - No, no.

867
00:27:01,710 --> 00:27:02,720
(Before Jong Kook joins, they touch each other.)

868
00:27:02,721 --> 00:27:04,320
- No, no. - It's a touch.

869
00:27:04,321 --> 00:27:05,689
- It is. - It's not.

870
00:27:05,690 --> 00:27:07,619
- We're 10. - We're 10.

871
00:27:07,620 --> 00:27:10,090
- Why? - We won over there.

872
00:27:10,091 --> 00:27:12,260
I was on my way. You should've touched them later.

873
00:27:12,261 --> 00:27:15,014
Have a match. Rock-paper-scissors.

874
00:27:15,061 --> 00:27:16,899
- Rock-paper-scissors. - Rock-paper-scissors.

875
00:27:16,900 --> 00:27:19,000
(Dong Hwi wins.)

876
00:27:19,001 --> 00:27:20,500
Okay! Okay!

877
00:27:20,501 --> 00:27:22,479
No. We need to tell Mom.

878
00:27:22,971 --> 00:27:24,022
Let's go.

879
00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:25,895
We lost.

880
00:27:26,471 --> 00:27:28,408
- We're done for. - They're 20 now.

881
00:27:28,541 --> 00:27:30,439
(These two have been watching.)

882
00:27:30,440 --> 00:27:31,709
- Let's go. - But...

883
00:27:31,710 --> 00:27:33,240
But it won't work.

884
00:27:33,450 --> 00:27:34,879
- He's alone. - From here to there...

885
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:36,949
Let's separate. Let's split up.

886
00:27:36,950 --> 00:27:38,520
No, we shouldn't.

887
00:27:38,521 --> 00:27:40,189
Jae Seok is five.

888
00:27:40,190 --> 00:27:42,129
- No, he's 10. - How old are you?

889
00:27:42,360 --> 00:27:44,320
- Oh, he's 5. - I'm 48.

890
00:27:44,321 --> 00:27:46,090
- What are you saying? - He's five.

891
00:27:46,091 --> 00:27:47,866
Not your real age.

892
00:27:47,890 --> 00:27:48,959
- He's five. - Split up.

893
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:52,199
Okay. If we touch the house, we'll be 20 years in total.

894
00:27:52,200 --> 00:27:53,330
(Their ages will double if they touch it.)

895
00:27:53,331 --> 00:27:54,699
I got him.

896
00:27:54,700 --> 00:27:55,720
(Jae Seok touches him.)

897
00:27:56,541 --> 00:27:57,570
(Kwang Soo touches the house.)

898
00:27:57,571 --> 00:27:58,866
- I touched the house! - I touched him.

899
00:27:58,971 --> 00:28:01,909
(Seok Jin gets touched and becomes zero years old.)

900
00:28:01,910 --> 00:28:03,609
(Thanks to Seok Jin's sacrifice,)

901
00:28:03,610 --> 00:28:06,304
(Kwang Soo doubles his age.)

902
00:28:06,311 --> 00:28:08,217
- I touched Seok Jin first. - I touched their house!

903
00:28:08,511 --> 00:28:09,949
Hurry up and come here!

904
00:28:09,950 --> 00:28:12,542
I touched their house! I did!

905
00:28:13,091 --> 00:28:15,232
Kwang Soo is 20 now!

906
00:28:15,591 --> 00:28:16,885
We're older too.

907
00:28:16,890 --> 00:28:18,350
We won.

908
00:28:18,360 --> 00:28:19,889
- How old are you? - We're...

909
00:28:19,890 --> 00:28:21,189
- We won. - We're 10, so...

910
00:28:21,190 --> 00:28:22,934
Are you okay? You look sick.

911
00:28:23,731 --> 00:28:25,536
- We won. - We're...

912
00:28:26,331 --> 00:28:28,330
- Us two will win against anyone. - Okay.

913
00:28:28,331 --> 00:28:30,639
- We'll win against them all. - Take a breath, Dong Hwi.

914
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:32,508
We will win. Hold on.

915
00:28:32,610 --> 00:28:35,209
Dong Hwi's lips are pale.

916
00:28:35,210 --> 00:28:36,302
Breathe.

917
00:28:36,511 --> 00:28:38,041
You and I should go.

918
00:28:38,241 --> 00:28:39,510
- He's 10. - Haha.

919
00:28:39,511 --> 00:28:41,183
They might want a match.

920
00:28:41,311 --> 00:28:42,545
Then we'll give it to them.

921
00:28:42,721 --> 00:28:44,679
- Kwang Soo, you can do it. - They don't know my age.

922
00:28:44,680 --> 00:28:46,090
Just go.

923
00:28:46,091 --> 00:28:48,467
(Kwang Soo approaches them.)

924
00:28:48,920 --> 00:28:50,522
How old are you? You're older than me, right?

925
00:28:51,561 --> 00:28:52,629
How about you?

926
00:28:52,630 --> 00:28:53,859
(They ask each other first.)

927
00:28:53,860 --> 00:28:54,880
I'm 10.

928
00:28:55,731 --> 00:28:57,536
- Are you older? - How old do you think I am?

929
00:28:58,160 --> 00:28:59,530
Find out how old Haha is.

930
00:28:59,531 --> 00:29:01,947
(They go against each other.)

931
00:29:02,971 --> 00:29:04,070
(Seok Jin comes to help.)

932
00:29:04,071 --> 00:29:06,270
Come here, come here!

933
00:29:06,271 --> 00:29:08,609
- Come here! - Hold hands.

934
00:29:08,610 --> 00:29:10,080
We need to hold hands.

935
00:29:10,081 --> 00:29:11,080
- Hold on! - Hey.

936
00:29:11,081 --> 00:29:12,477
(Kwang Soo is frightened.)

937
00:29:13,150 --> 00:29:14,280
(He lets go of Seok Jin.)

938
00:29:14,281 --> 00:29:15,301
Run!

939
00:29:15,380 --> 00:29:16,379
Jong Kook.

940
00:29:16,380 --> 00:29:17,619
(Kwang Soo saves himself.)

941
00:29:17,620 --> 00:29:19,790
(But what about Seok Jin?)

942
00:29:19,791 --> 00:29:21,990
- We did it. - Good job.

943
00:29:21,991 --> 00:29:22,990
(Kwang Soo and Seok Jin were older together.)

944
00:29:22,991 --> 00:29:24,889
(Seok Jin gets caught.)

945
00:29:24,890 --> 00:29:27,590
- Good job. Let's go. - Seok Jin.

946
00:29:27,591 --> 00:29:28,689
(Haha and Jong Kook are each 15 years old.)

947
00:29:28,690 --> 00:29:29,899
- Gosh. - Okay.

948
00:29:29,900 --> 00:29:31,800
- We got 5 years. - We each got 5 years.

949
00:29:31,801 --> 00:29:34,199
Had we held hands, we would've won.

950
00:29:34,200 --> 00:29:35,527
I can go alone.

951
00:29:36,501 --> 00:29:38,800
- I don't know their age. - How old are they?

952
00:29:38,801 --> 00:29:40,707
Let's do rock-paper-scissors.

953
00:29:40,910 --> 00:29:42,675
- Don't bring Seok Jin. - Okay, let's do it.

954
00:29:42,910 --> 00:29:45,124
- We won't hold hands. - Leave This Guy behind.

955
00:29:45,210 --> 00:29:46,578
Don't call me that!

956
00:29:46,610 --> 00:29:47,709
Okay, let's do it.

957
00:29:47,710 --> 00:29:48,980
Hey, That Guy.

958
00:29:48,981 --> 00:29:50,849
- Come. I'll have a match with him. - Stay behind.

959
00:29:50,850 --> 00:29:52,789
- I'm serious. One on one. - Okay.

960
00:29:52,890 --> 00:29:54,189
Let's do it.

961
00:29:54,190 --> 00:29:55,854
- Okay! - Why?

962
00:29:56,021 --> 00:29:57,689
(Kwang Soo touches So Min.)

963
00:29:57,690 --> 00:30:00,189
- I'm 25 years old! - What?

964
00:30:00,190 --> 00:30:01,924
No, you're not!

965
00:30:02,700 --> 00:30:03,823
I touched So Min!

966
00:30:04,630 --> 00:30:05,629
I touched So Min.

967
00:30:05,630 --> 00:30:08,251
When did That Guy age so much?

968
00:30:09,640 --> 00:30:11,270
Aren't we 15 years old?

969
00:30:11,271 --> 00:30:13,759
- Yes, we are. - We should hold hands to beat him.

970
00:30:13,870 --> 00:30:14,909
We'll win if we hold hands.

971
00:30:14,910 --> 00:30:17,328
- But they're touching it. - Right.

972
00:30:17,341 --> 00:30:18,606
- We need to hold hands. - What?

973
00:30:18,811 --> 00:30:20,411
They're 35.

974
00:30:20,551 --> 00:30:23,020
- Who? - But we're older than them.

975
00:30:23,021 --> 00:30:24,917
Jong Kook. Jong Kook.

976
00:30:25,581 --> 00:30:27,151
Jong Kook. Jong Kook.

977
00:30:27,791 --> 00:30:28,849
Jong Kook.

978
00:30:28,850 --> 00:30:31,206
(One house is empty.)

979
00:30:31,261 --> 00:30:34,090
(Do you see that empty house?)

980
00:30:34,091 --> 00:30:35,356
Hey, they're coming!

981
00:30:36,100 --> 00:30:38,376
(Kwang Soo attacks.)

982
00:30:39,271 --> 00:30:40,698
Wait a minute!

983
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:42,869
- Wait! Kwang Soo! - Hey!

984
00:30:42,870 --> 00:30:43,869
I touched her!

985
00:30:43,870 --> 00:30:45,470
(Kwang Soo touches So Min and becomes 30 years old.)

986
00:30:45,471 --> 00:30:47,310
- Go home! - They're coming!

987
00:30:47,311 --> 00:30:48,636
(Meanwhile,)

988
00:30:49,380 --> 00:30:50,400
Jong Kook is coming.

989
00:30:50,741 --> 00:30:53,973
(Jong Kook runs towards the empty house.)

990
00:30:54,481 --> 00:30:55,480
(We need to defend!)

991
00:30:55,481 --> 00:30:56,501
I'll go.

992
00:30:59,991 --> 00:31:01,827
Se Chan, let's hold hands.

993
00:31:02,291 --> 00:31:04,060
(He successfully touches it.)

994
00:31:04,061 --> 00:31:05,112
Darn it.

995
00:31:05,390 --> 00:31:07,501
(Jong Kook is 30 years old too.)

996
00:31:07,690 --> 00:31:10,760
I thought he was in a car. A car just passed me by.

997
00:31:10,801 --> 00:31:11,881
He was fast.

998
00:31:12,261 --> 00:31:14,570
Jong Kook. We lost.

999
00:31:14,571 --> 00:31:15,651
I'm 30 now.

1000
00:31:16,541 --> 00:31:18,917
Did you hit it? You're amazing.

1001
00:31:19,100 --> 00:31:20,510
Then let's hold hands and go.

1002
00:31:20,511 --> 00:31:23,162
- Hold on. - You have two minutes left.

1003
00:31:24,241 --> 00:31:25,943
We need to target the house on the left.

1004
00:31:26,110 --> 00:31:28,355
- Right? - Yes, that's our best bet.

1005
00:31:28,380 --> 00:31:29,520
All right.

1006
00:31:29,521 --> 00:31:30,520
(Great minds think alike.)

1007
00:31:30,521 --> 00:31:31,679
We're still older.

1008
00:31:31,680 --> 00:31:32,742
(Great minds think alike.)

1009
00:31:32,991 --> 00:31:34,246
Jae Seok is five.

1010
00:31:35,051 --> 00:31:36,689
- Aren't you a baby? - What?

1011
00:31:36,690 --> 00:31:38,320
- Aren't you a baby? - He's an infant.

1012
00:31:38,321 --> 00:31:39,959
Wait. Aren't you a kid?

1013
00:31:39,960 --> 00:31:42,307
(They feel each other out.)

1014
00:31:42,331 --> 00:31:45,000
(Kwang Soo, 30 years old, attacks.)

1015
00:31:45,001 --> 00:31:47,142
Okay. If we touch him, we'll win.

1016
00:31:47,600 --> 00:31:48,800
- Touch him. Touch! - Touch!

1017
00:31:48,801 --> 00:31:49,970
- Touch! - How old are you?

1018
00:31:49,971 --> 00:31:51,470
- I'm 30. - Really?

1019
00:31:51,471 --> 00:31:52,838
I am. I'm 35.

1020
00:31:53,110 --> 00:31:54,439
- How is that possible? - Is he...

1021
00:31:54,440 --> 00:31:55,970
- 35? - I touched the house twice.

1022
00:31:56,110 --> 00:31:57,639
We didn't know his age.

1023
00:31:57,640 --> 00:31:58,740
(Kwang Soo is on a roll and is now 35.)

1024
00:31:58,741 --> 00:32:00,443
- We had no idea. - I touched Se Chan!

1025
00:32:00,481 --> 00:32:02,969
He's really old now. We need to defend.

1026
00:32:03,380 --> 00:32:05,523
Soon, he'll be 60.

1027
00:32:06,051 --> 00:32:08,619
Kwang Soo will turn 60 soon.

1028
00:32:08,620 --> 00:32:09,859
Kwang Soo, you'll be 70...

1029
00:32:09,860 --> 00:32:12,220
- if you touch their house. - Yes.

1030
00:32:12,221 --> 00:32:13,459
(Their team is still in 2nd place.)

1031
00:32:13,460 --> 00:32:16,868
(With only 30 seconds remaining, he needs to make the last run.)

1032
00:32:18,001 --> 00:32:19,530
Come here if you dare. Hey.

1033
00:32:19,531 --> 00:32:21,102
(I need to attack Jae Seok's team.)

1034
00:32:21,501 --> 00:32:22,928
Are you That One or The Other One?

1035
00:32:23,440 --> 00:32:24,899
- He's That One. - Which one are you?

1036
00:32:24,900 --> 00:32:25,970
He's This One.

1037
00:32:25,971 --> 00:32:27,970
This One. Hey, This One.

1038
00:32:27,971 --> 00:32:29,310
- Come here, This One. - Come here.

1039
00:32:29,311 --> 00:32:31,439
(Jong Kook chooses to defend.)

1040
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:32,838
- Come here, This One. - Come here.

1041
00:32:33,511 --> 00:32:34,609
Run, run.

1042
00:32:34,610 --> 00:32:35,609
(After teasing him, Kwang Soo attacks.)

1043
00:32:35,610 --> 00:32:38,435
(He lunges at Jae Seok at full throttle.)

1044
00:32:38,481 --> 00:32:40,489
(Suddenly, Jae Seok switches directions.)

1045
00:32:41,051 --> 00:32:42,927
(Kwang Soo spots an empty house.)

1046
00:32:43,521 --> 00:32:45,060
(He switches directions...)

1047
00:32:45,061 --> 00:32:47,730
(and dashes towards the empty house.)

1048
00:32:47,731 --> 00:32:49,459
(Se Chan runs towards him.)

1049
00:32:49,460 --> 00:32:52,562
(Who will arrive first?)

1050
00:32:53,170 --> 00:32:54,530
- Touch! - Good job!

1051
00:32:54,531 --> 00:32:55,723
(Kwang Soo arrives first.)

1052
00:32:56,071 --> 00:32:59,369
(He turns the tables around by doubling his age.)

1053
00:32:59,370 --> 00:33:00,900
I'm 70 years old!

1054
00:33:01,170 --> 00:33:02,262
We're in last place.

1055
00:33:02,610 --> 00:33:03,905
I made it!

1056
00:33:04,610 --> 00:33:05,630
It's over.

1057
00:33:05,640 --> 00:33:07,209
I'm older than Seok Jin!

1058
00:33:07,210 --> 00:33:08,709
- Hey! - We're in last place.

1059
00:33:08,710 --> 00:33:11,080
- Time's up. Please come here. - Good job.

1060
00:33:11,081 --> 00:33:12,346
(This can't be.)

1061
00:33:13,021 --> 00:33:15,397
The winners of this round are...

1062
00:33:15,420 --> 00:33:16,889
This Guy, That Guy, and Hey, There.

1063
00:33:16,890 --> 00:33:19,260
(They acquire 4 syllables.)

1064
00:33:19,261 --> 00:33:20,618
(They're disappointed.)

1065
00:33:21,261 --> 00:33:22,994
We'd like the syllables "Lee", "Kwang", and "Soo".

1066
00:33:23,261 --> 00:33:24,322
Hey.

1067
00:33:24,400 --> 00:33:26,308
- What? No, right now. - No.

1068
00:33:26,370 --> 00:33:28,064
- That means you get a syllable too. - Right.

1069
00:33:28,231 --> 00:33:29,292
- That's a relief. - Yes.

1070
00:33:30,071 --> 00:33:31,240
I hope they ask for "Lee" and "Seok".

1071
00:33:31,241 --> 00:33:33,178
- Dong Hwi shares your last name. - Then "Song"...

1072
00:33:33,210 --> 00:33:34,810
- They don't have "Ji", right? - No.

1073
00:33:34,811 --> 00:33:36,372
- "Song" either. - "Ji".

1074
00:33:36,481 --> 00:33:37,909
"Song", "Ji", "Kwang", and "Soo".

1075
00:33:37,910 --> 00:33:39,240
- Thank you. - That's good.

1076
00:33:39,241 --> 00:33:41,480
- You'll get those four syllables. - It's final.

1077
00:33:41,481 --> 00:33:42,480
It's final.

1078
00:33:42,481 --> 00:33:43,704
(They receive "Song", "Ji", "Kwang", and "Soo".)

1079
00:33:45,481 --> 00:33:47,153
Wow, I was amazing.

1080
00:33:47,420 --> 00:33:49,689
You were our hero.

1081
00:33:49,690 --> 00:33:51,520
You looked so cool while sprinting.

1082
00:33:51,521 --> 00:33:54,290
Kwang Soo becomes a hero since he's with Seok Jin.

1083
00:33:54,291 --> 00:33:56,300
Yes. Now, you can call me "Kwang Soo".

1084
00:33:56,801 --> 00:33:57,899
Call me by my first name.

1085
00:33:57,900 --> 00:33:59,800
- That Guy. - No. No more That Guy.

1086
00:33:59,801 --> 00:34:01,470
- All right, Kwang Soo. - You're still That Guy.

1087
00:34:01,471 --> 00:34:02,599
- You don't have a surname yet. - It needs to be combined.

1088
00:34:02,600 --> 00:34:04,029
- Shouldn't they be combined? - That Kwang Soo.

1089
00:34:04,170 --> 00:34:06,010
- That Kwang Soo. - That Guy Kwang Soo.

1090
00:34:06,011 --> 00:34:07,010
(There are two choices.)

1091
00:34:07,011 --> 00:34:08,740
- That Guy Kwang Soo. - That's not right.

1092
00:34:08,741 --> 00:34:10,879
- That doesn't work, right? - That Kwang Soo.

1093
00:34:10,880 --> 00:34:12,479
- That Kwang Soo Guy. - That Kwang Soo Guy.

1094
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:14,910
- You don't need to combine them. - That Guy Kwang Soo.

1095
00:34:14,911 --> 00:34:17,531
If our team had won...

1096
00:34:17,580 --> 00:34:20,220
and we picked "Ha", I would've found my full name.

1097
00:34:20,221 --> 00:34:21,490
- You're right. - That's right.

1098
00:34:21,491 --> 00:34:23,689
- Exactly. - He just needs one syllable.

1099
00:34:23,690 --> 00:34:25,590
- You're right. - He has an advantage.

1100
00:34:25,591 --> 00:34:27,160
He has an advantage.

1101
00:34:27,161 --> 00:34:28,289
- You're right. - He does.

1102
00:34:28,290 --> 00:34:31,459
Had I known, I would've named myself "Kim Kim".

1103
00:34:31,460 --> 00:34:32,629
(He makes up a ridiculous name.)

1104
00:34:32,630 --> 00:34:34,100
- I'd choose "Yang Yang". - I would've done so.

1105
00:34:34,101 --> 00:34:35,800
- "Yang Yang". - Only if I had known...

1106
00:34:35,801 --> 00:34:37,700
- I'd pick "Jeon Jeon". - "Jeon Jeon" and "Yang Yang".

1107
00:34:37,701 --> 00:34:38,899
- "Jeon Jeon". - I'd pick "Jee Jee".

1108
00:34:38,900 --> 00:34:41,169
But in your case, you'd get a syllable...

1109
00:34:41,170 --> 00:34:42,609
- from Jae Seok. - Yes, "Seok".

1110
00:34:42,610 --> 00:34:44,809
- We overlap. - I won't choose "Seok".

1111
00:34:44,810 --> 00:34:46,479
(He's curt.)

1112
00:34:46,480 --> 00:34:48,079
(I'm going to be "Yu Jae" for today.)

1113
00:34:48,080 --> 00:34:49,109
- Hey. - You'd rather be penalized.

1114
00:34:49,110 --> 00:34:50,780
I'd rather be penalized.

1115
00:34:50,781 --> 00:34:53,320
I'll never ask for "Seok". Over my dead body.

1116
00:34:53,321 --> 00:34:55,249
- Unless he asks for it, right? - Yes.

1117
00:34:55,250 --> 00:34:57,189
Unless he asks for it, I won't ever do it.

1118
00:34:57,190 --> 00:34:58,260
- That's great. - As if.

1119
00:34:58,261 --> 00:35:00,390
- I will never ask for "Seok". - I just need "Lee".

1120
00:35:00,391 --> 00:35:02,760
- If Dong Hwi wins, I'll get it. - Dong Hwi!

1121
00:35:02,761 --> 00:35:04,129
Don't ever find "Lee".

1122
00:35:04,130 --> 00:35:05,959
- But then you can't win. - We don't have to.

1123
00:35:05,960 --> 00:35:08,729
- What do we get for finding it? - Nothing.

1124
00:35:08,730 --> 00:35:09,939
We're never finding "Seok" and "Lee"...

1125
00:35:09,940 --> 00:35:12,100
even if it means all of us failing...

1126
00:35:12,101 --> 00:35:13,672
except for Se Chan.

1127
00:35:14,810 --> 00:35:17,055
(We'd rather get the penalty than help this team.)

1128
00:35:17,540 --> 00:35:20,379
You still have to find them even though it'd help us.

1129
00:35:20,380 --> 00:35:21,737
- Come on. - So that's it.

1130
00:35:22,051 --> 00:35:23,917
We're never finding "Seok" and "Lee".

1131
00:35:24,451 --> 00:35:25,820
Nice weather.

1132
00:35:25,821 --> 00:35:27,490
(They arrive at their next mission with cherry blossoms.)

1133
00:35:27,491 --> 00:35:28,720
- We'll find it. - We'll find it.

1134
00:35:28,721 --> 00:35:30,454
I've never wanted to find my name this much.

1135
00:35:30,661 --> 00:35:32,394
For this mission,

1136
00:35:32,931 --> 00:35:35,859
you'll need the innocence of children and luck to win.

1137
00:35:35,860 --> 00:35:37,697
- It's Kids Quiz! - Great.

1138
00:35:38,630 --> 00:35:39,669
Kids Quiz?

1139
00:35:39,670 --> 00:35:41,430
- It's about kids. - Kids Quiz.

1140
00:35:41,431 --> 00:35:42,828
This is my thing.

1141
00:35:42,871 --> 00:35:44,399
- Kids Quiz. - Kids Quiz.

1142
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:47,240
We'll be giving you questions suited to the children's eyes.

1143
00:35:47,241 --> 00:35:48,740
When a team gets the correct answer,

1144
00:35:48,741 --> 00:35:51,640
they can draw one from the drawing board.

1145
00:35:51,641 --> 00:35:53,910
We used to do that when we were kids.

1146
00:35:53,911 --> 00:35:55,249
- We did. - Right.

1147
00:35:55,250 --> 00:35:57,393
The board has the names of snacks of your memories,

1148
00:35:57,951 --> 00:36:00,979
and one note that says, "Number 1".

1149
00:36:01,290 --> 00:36:03,559
If you draw that note, your team wins right away.

1150
00:36:03,560 --> 00:36:05,120
(As you draw the Number 1 note,)

1151
00:36:05,121 --> 00:36:06,660
(your team wins and the game is over.)

1152
00:36:06,661 --> 00:36:07,813
- Good. - Seriously?

1153
00:36:08,431 --> 00:36:09,999
- We need luck. - Even if we draw it at first?

1154
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:11,059
Let's do it this time.

1155
00:36:11,060 --> 00:36:13,399
The winning team will receive syllables.

1156
00:36:13,400 --> 00:36:14,600
We must get this.

1157
00:36:14,601 --> 00:36:16,740
- Then it's over. - Then we win.

1158
00:36:16,741 --> 00:36:18,039
If we win, the game's over.

1159
00:36:18,040 --> 00:36:19,939
"Let me answer" will be confusing.

1160
00:36:19,940 --> 00:36:21,165
So come up with your slogans.

1161
00:36:21,210 --> 00:36:22,939
- "This, that, the other guy"? - "This, that, the other guy".

1162
00:36:22,940 --> 00:36:24,165
We'll go with "This, that, the other guy".

1163
00:36:24,241 --> 00:36:25,536
- Baby! - Baby?

1164
00:36:25,610 --> 00:36:27,050
- We're going with Baby. - Baby.

1165
00:36:27,051 --> 00:36:28,379
How about, "Let's go, Baby"?

1166
00:36:28,380 --> 00:36:30,287
- Baby. - Like, "Let's go, Baby".

1167
00:36:31,321 --> 00:36:32,479
How about "Dandies"?

1168
00:36:32,480 --> 00:36:34,189
(How about "Dandies"?)

1169
00:36:34,190 --> 00:36:37,059
Seok Jin wants to name our team, "Dandies".

1170
00:36:37,060 --> 00:36:38,220
(You heard what Seok Jin just said?)

1171
00:36:38,221 --> 00:36:39,959
(Why would you tell them? It's embarrassing.)

1172
00:36:39,960 --> 00:36:41,359
- It's... - "Dandies"?

1173
00:36:41,360 --> 00:36:43,499
Here come the Dandies!

1174
00:36:43,500 --> 00:36:45,899
This is the worst team name I've ever seen...

1175
00:36:45,900 --> 00:36:47,169
- in 10 years! - The dandy gentlemen.

1176
00:36:47,170 --> 00:36:48,863
- Come on, "Dandies"? - "Dandies".

1177
00:36:48,871 --> 00:36:50,706
Just go with "This Guy, That Guy"!

1178
00:36:50,770 --> 00:36:52,700
We'll go with Pretty Boys.

1179
00:36:52,701 --> 00:36:55,269
(We're going with Pretty Boys if they're using "Dandies".)

1180
00:36:55,270 --> 00:36:56,379
Come on.

1181
00:36:56,380 --> 00:36:57,939
That's better. Pretty Boys.

1182
00:36:57,940 --> 00:36:59,165
- We're the Pretty Boys. - Okay.

1183
00:36:59,310 --> 00:37:00,950
- Pretty Boys, it is. - Pretty Boys.

1184
00:37:00,951 --> 00:37:03,776
Dong Hwi, you're the most handsome in that group!

1185
00:37:03,821 --> 00:37:05,687
You're number one.

1186
00:37:05,951 --> 00:37:08,890
You can't even get to second place when you're in this group.

1187
00:37:08,891 --> 00:37:10,220
How about Cute and Small?

1188
00:37:10,221 --> 00:37:11,383
Are you serious?

1189
00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:13,091
We'll go with Cute and Small.

1190
00:37:13,630 --> 00:37:15,030
Let's summarize, we're Baby.

1191
00:37:15,031 --> 00:37:16,387
- Cute and Small! - Cute and Small!

1192
00:37:16,431 --> 00:37:18,266
- Pretty Boys! - Okay, then the game starts now.

1193
00:37:18,330 --> 00:37:19,499
(They're going to stick with Pretty Boys.)

1194
00:37:19,500 --> 00:37:21,000
It sounds hilarious.

1195
00:37:21,031 --> 00:37:22,070
I think it's fine.

1196
00:37:22,071 --> 00:37:24,340
- Right? - There are flowers in the back too.

1197
00:37:24,341 --> 00:37:26,240
- Right. - There are flowers.

1198
00:37:26,241 --> 00:37:28,570
- It's hilarious. - Film us with the flowers.

1199
00:37:28,571 --> 00:37:31,263
- Pretty Boys. - Here's the first question.

1200
00:37:31,681 --> 00:37:33,006
- The name doesn't suit them. - I'll tell you...

1201
00:37:33,250 --> 00:37:36,005
a part of a test solved by an elementary school child.

1202
00:37:36,420 --> 00:37:39,450
Guess exactly what the child wrote as the answer.

1203
00:37:39,451 --> 00:37:40,620
- Yes. - We should think like them.

1204
00:37:40,621 --> 00:37:41,820
(What did you think it was grand?)

1205
00:37:41,821 --> 00:37:44,718
"Write one thing that you thought was grand".

1206
00:37:44,960 --> 00:37:47,000
- So we should think like kids. - Baby!

1207
00:37:47,261 --> 00:37:48,590
Baby! Let me answer.

1208
00:37:48,591 --> 00:37:49,682
The school field.

1209
00:37:50,101 --> 00:37:51,300
- That's not it. - It's not?

1210
00:37:51,301 --> 00:37:52,454
(Wrong answer)

1211
00:37:52,730 --> 00:37:53,870
- Pretty Boys! - Pretty Boys!

1212
00:37:53,871 --> 00:37:54,870
(Dong Hwi goes for it.)

1213
00:37:54,871 --> 00:37:57,421
Your own poop.

1214
00:37:58,000 --> 00:37:59,499
- Right. - That's right.

1215
00:37:59,500 --> 00:38:01,039
(Wrong answer)

1216
00:38:01,040 --> 00:38:02,540
I was going to say that.

1217
00:38:03,380 --> 00:38:04,709
- Elementary school... - Cute and Small!

1218
00:38:04,710 --> 00:38:06,079
(Seok Jin goes for it.)

1219
00:38:06,080 --> 00:38:07,149
Dad's tummy.

1220
00:38:07,150 --> 00:38:09,209
(Dad's tummy.)

1221
00:38:09,210 --> 00:38:10,302
Wrong answer.

1222
00:38:10,621 --> 00:38:11,720
"Grand"?

1223
00:38:11,721 --> 00:38:13,390
(What could they have thought it was grand?)

1224
00:38:13,391 --> 00:38:14,880
- Grand... - For your information,

1225
00:38:15,551 --> 00:38:18,019
- Seok Jin was close. - I knew it.

1226
00:38:18,020 --> 00:38:20,059
(The answer was close to Seok Jin's.)

1227
00:38:20,060 --> 00:38:21,080
Baby!

1228
00:38:21,560 --> 00:38:22,629
It's mom.

1229
00:38:22,630 --> 00:38:25,100
(I figured it out. It's mom.)

1230
00:38:25,101 --> 00:38:27,313
Mom's tummy after she ate.

1231
00:38:27,431 --> 00:38:28,470
Be more specific.

1232
00:38:28,471 --> 00:38:29,694
Mom's potbelly!

1233
00:38:30,270 --> 00:38:31,769
- Good answer. - Mom's potbelly?

1234
00:38:31,770 --> 00:38:32,923
Mom's tummy.

1235
00:38:33,170 --> 00:38:34,910
- Choose your answer. - Mom's tummy.

1236
00:38:34,911 --> 00:38:35,931
- Tummy. - Tummy.

1237
00:38:36,241 --> 00:38:38,010
(Will it be correct?)

1238
00:38:38,011 --> 00:38:39,101
Come on.

1239
00:38:39,610 --> 00:38:43,496
(Mom's tummy was correct.)

1240
00:38:43,821 --> 00:38:45,220
(Haha was the president of elementary school kids after all.)

1241
00:38:45,221 --> 00:38:47,189
I think like a child!

1242
00:38:47,190 --> 00:38:49,598
"Every Music Box!"

1243
00:38:49,690 --> 00:38:51,160
The answer was "Mom's tummy".

1244
00:38:51,161 --> 00:38:53,729
- I was so close! - Seriously?

1245
00:38:53,730 --> 00:38:55,729
If I said "Dad", you should say "Mom"!

1246
00:38:56,031 --> 00:38:57,329
That was close.

1247
00:38:57,330 --> 00:38:59,717
But they still have to draw the Number 1 note.

1248
00:39:00,270 --> 00:39:01,525
Here we come.

1249
00:39:01,531 --> 00:39:03,203
Let's go, Haha.

1250
00:39:03,241 --> 00:39:05,342
If you draw the Number 1 note, you win.

1251
00:39:05,400 --> 00:39:06,533
This is...

1252
00:39:06,841 --> 00:39:08,034
Which one?

1253
00:39:08,511 --> 00:39:10,417
- I like the right lane. - Go for...

1254
00:39:10,710 --> 00:39:11,939
the bottom on the left.

1255
00:39:11,940 --> 00:39:13,109
- Left? - The bottom one.

1256
00:39:13,110 --> 00:39:14,273
- And you like the right ones? - Yes.

1257
00:39:14,580 --> 00:39:15,809
This? The right one?

1258
00:39:15,810 --> 00:39:17,208
It's your choice. Go with So Min's idea.

1259
00:39:17,451 --> 00:39:18,820
The second bottom one on the right.

1260
00:39:18,821 --> 00:39:21,220
(The second bottom one on the right as So Min wants.)

1261
00:39:21,221 --> 00:39:22,271
- This one? - Yes.

1262
00:39:22,721 --> 00:39:23,890
1, 2, 3.

1263
00:39:23,891 --> 00:39:25,696
(They choose based on So Min's decision.)

1264
00:39:26,460 --> 00:39:32,559
(Will it say "Number 1" like So Min thinks?)

1265
00:39:32,560 --> 00:39:33,629
It's the ring candy.

1266
00:39:33,630 --> 00:39:36,269
(Instead of the note)

1267
00:39:36,270 --> 00:39:38,269
- I haven't seen it for a while. - That sounds sweet.

1268
00:39:38,270 --> 00:39:39,709
- It's been a while. - I like ring candy.

1269
00:39:39,710 --> 00:39:41,470
- It's been a while. - They still make those?

1270
00:39:41,471 --> 00:39:42,910
That's it. That's ring candy.

1271
00:39:42,911 --> 00:39:44,479
(He earned the nostalgic ring candy.)

1272
00:39:44,480 --> 00:39:46,079
It melts on your fingers.

1273
00:39:46,080 --> 00:39:48,050
- And it gets sticky. - Right.

1274
00:39:48,650 --> 00:39:50,150
That's the one.

1275
00:39:50,181 --> 00:39:51,711
- It's the ring candy. - Next question.

1276
00:39:52,121 --> 00:39:56,405
Next is related to cartoon characters.

1277
00:39:56,761 --> 00:39:58,519
- Good. - We got this.

1278
00:39:58,520 --> 00:40:01,243
Guess the name of the character correctly.

1279
00:40:02,190 --> 00:40:03,859
I don't know any from recent ones.

1280
00:40:03,860 --> 00:40:04,952
- Me neither. - It's the old one!

1281
00:40:05,661 --> 00:40:07,334
Baby!

1282
00:40:07,471 --> 00:40:08,870
- Let me answer! - Let me answer!

1283
00:40:08,871 --> 00:40:10,330
- No, it's Cute and Small. - Cute and Small!

1284
00:40:10,371 --> 00:40:12,105
Ken and Jun from "Science Ninja Team Gatchaman".

1285
00:40:13,241 --> 00:40:14,598
Pretty Boys!

1286
00:40:14,841 --> 00:40:16,479
- Cute and Small! - You need the character's name.

1287
00:40:16,480 --> 00:40:17,633
- Cute and Small! - Go ahead.

1288
00:40:18,141 --> 00:40:19,568
Chul Soo and Young Hee.

1289
00:40:19,880 --> 00:40:21,034
I think it's right.

1290
00:40:21,851 --> 00:40:23,010
- Is that wrong? - For your information,

1291
00:40:23,011 --> 00:40:24,579
the girl's name is Young Hee.

1292
00:40:24,580 --> 00:40:26,732
(The girl's name was Young Hee.)

1293
00:40:27,221 --> 00:40:28,220
So it's not Chul Soo.

1294
00:40:28,221 --> 00:40:29,390
- Baby! - Baby!

1295
00:40:29,391 --> 00:40:30,620
(Jong Kook goes for it.)

1296
00:40:30,621 --> 00:40:31,859
June and Young Hee.

1297
00:40:31,860 --> 00:40:33,257
- That's not it. - Pretty Boys!

1298
00:40:33,860 --> 00:40:34,959
- Pretty Boys! - Pretty Boys!

1299
00:40:34,960 --> 00:40:36,189
- It's our turn. - It's our turn.

1300
00:40:36,190 --> 00:40:37,353
Hoon and Young Hee!

1301
00:40:37,431 --> 00:40:38,889
- Say it again. - Hoon!

1302
00:40:39,161 --> 00:40:40,558
- And? - Young Hee.

1303
00:40:41,301 --> 00:40:43,207
(The correct answer is Hoon and Young Hee.)

1304
00:40:43,701 --> 00:40:45,870
(Jae Seok got the correct answer!)

1305
00:40:45,871 --> 00:40:46,910
Jae Seok!

1306
00:40:46,911 --> 00:40:49,240
Right, it was either Chul or Hoon.

1307
00:40:49,241 --> 00:40:51,147
- Right. - That's how they named it.

1308
00:40:51,281 --> 00:40:52,739
Dong Hwi, you draw.

1309
00:40:53,080 --> 00:40:54,131
Go ahead.

1310
00:40:54,480 --> 00:40:57,450
If I draw the winning note, then will we win?

1311
00:40:57,451 --> 00:41:00,174
(Their odds to draw the winning note is 1 in 27.)

1312
00:41:01,920 --> 00:41:03,090
- Should I go? - Go for it!

1313
00:41:03,091 --> 00:41:04,120
(He chose without hesitation.)

1314
00:41:04,121 --> 00:41:05,189
Please be the winning note.

1315
00:41:05,190 --> 00:41:06,629
(Will it be another snack, or the miraculous winning note?)

1316
00:41:06,630 --> 00:41:08,030
Dong Hwi, it's over if it says "Number 1".

1317
00:41:08,031 --> 00:41:09,329
(Will it be another snack, or the miraculous winning note?)

1318
00:41:09,330 --> 00:41:12,200
(Let's win those 3 syllables and find our names!)

1319
00:41:12,201 --> 00:41:14,030
- It's coke candy. - Not bad.

1320
00:41:14,031 --> 00:41:15,399
(They won the coke candy.)

1321
00:41:15,400 --> 00:41:16,800
(It's not bad.)

1322
00:41:16,801 --> 00:41:17,821
What's not bad?

1323
00:41:18,540 --> 00:41:19,724
- This is it? - It's not good either.

1324
00:41:20,871 --> 00:41:22,709
I used to eat those.

1325
00:41:22,710 --> 00:41:23,903
This is exciting.

1326
00:41:24,681 --> 00:41:26,139
This time,

1327
00:41:26,181 --> 00:41:27,979
you'll be listening to the theme songs of cartoons.

1328
00:41:27,980 --> 00:41:30,180
(Listen to the song and guess the name of the cartoon.)

1329
00:41:30,181 --> 00:41:31,955
- We got this. - Theme songs.

1330
00:41:32,181 --> 00:41:34,720
I know all the theme songs to cartoons.

1331
00:41:34,721 --> 00:41:36,660
- What did you get? - We got this!

1332
00:41:36,661 --> 00:41:37,789
I know everything!

1333
00:41:37,790 --> 00:41:40,990
We'll be playing the prelude for three seconds.

1334
00:41:40,991 --> 00:41:45,700
After listening to the songs, please guess the name of the cartoon.

1335
00:41:45,701 --> 00:41:47,129
- We don't get the lyrics? - If no one gets the right answer,

1336
00:41:47,130 --> 00:41:49,530
- we'll play until someone can. - Don't you worry about that.

1337
00:41:49,531 --> 00:41:50,740
(The music will play until we have a correct answer.)

1338
00:41:50,741 --> 00:41:53,439
(Music playing)

1339
00:41:53,440 --> 00:41:54,532
Pretty Boys!

1340
00:41:56,141 --> 00:41:57,843
- "Future Boy Conan". - Really?

1341
00:41:58,380 --> 00:42:00,420
("Future Boy Conan" was correct!)

1342
00:42:01,911 --> 00:42:04,620
(He only listened to the prelude for 3 seconds,)

1343
00:42:04,621 --> 00:42:08,919
(and guessed the correct title!)

1344
00:42:08,920 --> 00:42:10,012
No way.

1345
00:42:10,360 --> 00:42:11,890
- No way. - How do you know that?

1346
00:42:12,290 --> 00:42:13,454
What are you?

1347
00:42:14,330 --> 00:42:16,065
He's an old person.

1348
00:42:16,630 --> 00:42:19,007
Mom, do you see why I watched all those cartoons?

1349
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:21,327
You watched them for this?

1350
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:23,539
- What? - You watched it for this quiz?

1351
00:42:23,540 --> 00:42:24,669
Of course.

1352
00:42:24,670 --> 00:42:25,864
You planned this a long time ago.

1353
00:42:26,170 --> 00:42:27,538
That experience helps him now.

1354
00:42:28,810 --> 00:42:30,035
He's not going to draw the winning note.

1355
00:42:31,241 --> 00:42:32,780
How about the third one?

1356
00:42:32,781 --> 00:42:34,379
- This one? I thought so too. - Yes.

1357
00:42:34,380 --> 00:42:35,809
(The problem is, he's an expert in drawing duds.)

1358
00:42:35,810 --> 00:42:38,979
(Their odds to draw the winning note is 1 in 26.)

1359
00:42:38,980 --> 00:42:42,550
(Will his luck continue?)

1360
00:42:42,551 --> 00:42:43,760
Hardtack.

1361
00:42:43,761 --> 00:42:45,890
(He won the hardtack.)

1362
00:42:45,891 --> 00:42:46,981
Hardtack is fine.

1363
00:42:47,130 --> 00:42:48,459
(It's delicious, right?)

1364
00:42:48,460 --> 00:42:49,590
I feel dry already.

1365
00:42:49,591 --> 00:42:51,671
Hardtack in this weather?

1366
00:42:53,301 --> 00:42:55,544
- It's not too good, right? - It's fine.

1367
00:42:55,871 --> 00:42:57,070
It's not so good for this kind of weather.

1368
00:42:57,071 --> 00:42:58,162
(It's a combination of dryness.)

1369
00:42:58,601 --> 00:43:00,813
How did the song start?

1370
00:43:00,940 --> 00:43:03,357
Beyond the far blue ocean

1371
00:43:03,610 --> 00:43:05,109
It wasn't in my generation.

1372
00:43:05,110 --> 00:43:07,749
- Different generation. - It's too old for me.

1373
00:43:07,750 --> 00:43:10,180
To the sky

1374
00:43:10,181 --> 00:43:12,221
(Let's play the whole song for the younger generation.)

1375
00:43:12,880 --> 00:43:14,656
I bet he didn't listen to his mom.

1376
00:43:14,750 --> 00:43:15,990
How do we guess this?

1377
00:43:15,991 --> 00:43:19,427
(It's still not familiar to them.)

1378
00:43:19,460 --> 00:43:20,530
I think I remember.

1379
00:43:20,531 --> 00:43:22,590
(Now they remember.)

1380
00:43:22,591 --> 00:43:23,600
Right.

1381
00:43:23,601 --> 00:43:27,201
(There's new hope for us)

1382
00:43:27,400 --> 00:43:30,140
(To the sky, to the sky)

1383
00:43:30,141 --> 00:43:31,240
"Our dreams".

1384
00:43:31,241 --> 00:43:33,070
Our dreams bloom

1385
00:43:33,071 --> 00:43:34,294
"Earth is waking up".

1386
00:43:34,940 --> 00:43:38,480
Earth is waking up and the sun opens

1387
00:43:39,610 --> 00:43:41,979
(He sounds like a dolphin. He's singing really high notes.)

1388
00:43:41,980 --> 00:43:44,249
Who sings a cartoon theme song that high?

1389
00:43:44,250 --> 00:43:45,450
That's not how you do it.

1390
00:43:45,451 --> 00:43:47,225
- This is the original note. - Come on.

1391
00:43:47,690 --> 00:43:49,119
I thought he was Sim Soo Bong.

1392
00:43:50,420 --> 00:43:52,160
It ended too quickly,

1393
00:43:52,161 --> 00:43:55,629
so we'll give you another theme song quiz.

1394
00:43:55,630 --> 00:43:57,537
We only have to draw the winning note.

1395
00:43:57,661 --> 00:43:59,530
(Listen to the song and guess the name of the cartoon.)

1396
00:43:59,531 --> 00:44:02,223
(I don't get it.)

1397
00:44:03,101 --> 00:44:04,240
- I know this one. - Pretty Boys!

1398
00:44:04,241 --> 00:44:05,394
- What is it? - Pretty Boys!

1399
00:44:06,170 --> 00:44:07,809
(Jae Seok only listened to one bar of the prelude,)

1400
00:44:07,810 --> 00:44:09,470
(and he's ready to answer already.)

1401
00:44:09,471 --> 00:44:10,680
5, 4,

1402
00:44:10,681 --> 00:44:12,910
(Will he get it right again?)

1403
00:44:12,911 --> 00:44:14,379
Super, super, super

1404
00:44:14,380 --> 00:44:15,479
"Science Ninja Team Gatchaman"!

1405
00:44:15,480 --> 00:44:17,050
(It was correct.)

1406
00:44:17,051 --> 00:44:18,149
You did it!

1407
00:44:18,150 --> 00:44:21,312
(Jae Seok gets two in a row. He makes it again.)

1408
00:44:21,520 --> 00:44:23,120
(He's an expert in this field.)

1409
00:44:23,121 --> 00:44:24,689
- You knew it from the beginning. - I did.

1410
00:44:24,690 --> 00:44:26,700
- I loved this song. - Didn't you have any friends then?

1411
00:44:27,960 --> 00:44:29,012
Hey.

1412
00:44:29,860 --> 00:44:32,614
(He naturally reacts to the song.)

1413
00:44:33,161 --> 00:44:36,364
(Today is Jae Seok's day.)

1414
00:44:36,641 --> 00:44:38,399
(What is he dancing?)

1415
00:44:38,400 --> 00:44:40,583
(He's improvising the dance.)

1416
00:44:41,471 --> 00:44:43,609
(He is something else.)

1417
00:44:43,610 --> 00:44:45,709
I've watched that cartoon so many times,

1418
00:44:45,710 --> 00:44:46,850
but I'm not familiar with the song.

1419
00:44:46,851 --> 00:44:48,034
I know everything.

1420
00:44:48,411 --> 00:44:50,419
I watched cartoons even as a teenager.

1421
00:44:50,420 --> 00:44:51,419
(Jae Seok when he was a teenager.)

1422
00:44:51,420 --> 00:44:53,665
- I still watch them. - You were too old for that.

1423
00:44:54,250 --> 00:44:55,720
Let's go for this area.

1424
00:44:55,721 --> 00:44:56,789
Sure, let's try it.

1425
00:44:56,790 --> 00:44:58,669
(They have the third chance of drawing thanks to Jae Seok.)

1426
00:44:58,670 --> 00:45:00,680
- Let's go with this one. - If they...

1427
00:45:00,681 --> 00:45:02,815
(Their odds to draw the winning note is 1 in 25.)

1428
00:45:03,039 --> 00:45:08,039
{\an8}<font color="#fcc89b">[VIU Ver] SBS E450 Running Man</font>

<font color="#ff5fa2">-♥ Ruo Xi ♥-</font>

1429
00:45:08,210 --> 00:45:09,269
(He chose one note.)

1430
00:45:09,270 --> 00:45:11,280
- Let's go with this one. - If they...

1431
00:45:11,281 --> 00:45:16,209
(Their odds to draw the winning note is 1 in 25.)

1432
00:45:16,210 --> 00:45:17,979
It's the Popeye snack.

1433
00:45:17,980 --> 00:45:19,979
(They own a Popeye snack.)

1434
00:45:19,980 --> 00:45:21,653
How long do we have to eat these?

1435
00:45:21,750 --> 00:45:23,485
- They're all dry. - I'm thirsty.

1436
00:45:23,891 --> 00:45:25,360
Do you have any soda?

1437
00:45:25,361 --> 00:45:26,482
It's too dry.

1438
00:45:27,330 --> 00:45:29,160
Here's another question...

1439
00:45:29,161 --> 00:45:30,959
suited for the children's eyes.

1440
00:45:30,960 --> 00:45:34,329
We've asked the elementary school children about their dream jobs.

1441
00:45:34,330 --> 00:45:36,130
Number one was an athlete.

1442
00:45:36,131 --> 00:45:37,240
Athlete?

1443
00:45:37,241 --> 00:45:38,669
Number two was a teacher,

1444
00:45:39,400 --> 00:45:41,104
number three was a doctor and...

1445
00:45:42,040 --> 00:45:44,809
- number five was a video creator. - Baby!

1446
00:45:44,810 --> 00:45:46,709
(Baby!)

1447
00:45:46,710 --> 00:45:47,873
We have to guess number four?

1448
00:45:48,080 --> 00:45:49,273
Team Baby.

1449
00:45:49,411 --> 00:45:50,808
- It's number 4, right? - Number 4.

1450
00:45:51,381 --> 00:45:53,320
Number four, a youtuber!

1451
00:45:53,321 --> 00:45:54,779
Right, a youtuber.

1452
00:45:55,150 --> 00:45:56,189
Cute and Small!

1453
00:45:56,190 --> 00:45:58,220
A video creator includes youtubers.

1454
00:45:58,221 --> 00:45:59,995
- Cute and Small! - Cute and Small.

1455
00:46:00,730 --> 00:46:01,914
- A celebrity. - A celebrity.

1456
00:46:02,060 --> 00:46:03,189
It's the right answer.

1457
00:46:03,190 --> 00:46:04,700
(Their answer is "a celebrity".)

1458
00:46:04,701 --> 00:46:06,058
No one hasn't yet gotten it right.

1459
00:46:06,900 --> 00:46:08,156
Pretty Boys!

1460
00:46:08,201 --> 00:46:09,393
Government official.

1461
00:46:09,830 --> 00:46:10,939
No, that's not it.

1462
00:46:10,940 --> 00:46:12,399
(Wrong answer)

1463
00:46:12,500 --> 00:46:13,664
Come on.

1464
00:46:14,011 --> 00:46:15,640
I thought it was a trend.

1465
00:46:15,641 --> 00:46:16,769
Here's a hint.

1466
00:46:16,770 --> 00:46:20,110
This job is often on TV nowadays.

1467
00:46:20,111 --> 00:46:21,681
Nowadays?

1468
00:46:22,011 --> 00:46:23,209
- What is it? - Cute and Small!

1469
00:46:23,210 --> 00:46:24,302
- Cute and Small! - Yes.

1470
00:46:25,480 --> 00:46:26,479
A chef?

1471
00:46:26,480 --> 00:46:27,714
- Cute and Small! - Cute and Small!

1472
00:46:28,350 --> 00:46:29,550
- A chef. - A chef.

1473
00:46:29,551 --> 00:46:30,559
(Their answer is "a chef".)

1474
00:46:30,560 --> 00:46:31,860
Yes!

1475
00:46:31,861 --> 00:46:33,289
(Chef was correct.)

1476
00:46:33,290 --> 00:46:35,576
(They got the right answer for the first time.)

1477
00:46:35,591 --> 00:46:37,672
- We got it! - You got it.

1478
00:46:37,861 --> 00:46:38,982
We did it.

1479
00:46:39,100 --> 00:46:40,769
Right. A chef.

1480
00:46:40,770 --> 00:46:42,630
- Right. - Right.

1481
00:46:42,631 --> 00:46:44,068
I came up with patissier.

1482
00:46:44,141 --> 00:46:45,875
Please don't draw the winning note.

1483
00:46:46,270 --> 00:46:47,340
(Their odds to draw the winning note is 1 in 24.)

1484
00:46:47,341 --> 00:46:48,740
Kwang Soo.

1485
00:46:48,741 --> 00:46:50,640
This is our chance. Let's finish this game.

1486
00:46:50,641 --> 00:46:52,740
(If they draw the winning note, they're one step closer to winning.)

1487
00:46:52,741 --> 00:46:53,880
No way.

1488
00:46:53,881 --> 00:46:55,880
Of course it's another snack.

1489
00:46:55,881 --> 00:46:57,249
(They already have 4 syllables.)

1490
00:46:57,250 --> 00:46:58,579
- Fish jerky? - Fish jerky.

1491
00:46:58,580 --> 00:47:00,283
(They win a fish jerky.)

1492
00:47:01,051 --> 00:47:02,720
- It's a fish jerky. - Another dry snack.

1493
00:47:02,721 --> 00:47:04,016
(This salty and chewy snack bring back their old memories.)

1494
00:47:05,261 --> 00:47:07,811
(We're the ones who should feel choked.)

1495
00:47:08,161 --> 00:47:09,456
- Boyfriend and girlfriend. - Boyfriend and girlfriend.

1496
00:47:10,161 --> 00:47:11,559
It's another candy.

1497
00:47:11,560 --> 00:47:13,090
- "Sailor Moon"! - "Sailor Moon"!

1498
00:47:13,701 --> 00:47:15,199
- A conch snack. - A conch snack.

1499
00:47:15,500 --> 00:47:18,140
(Now there are only 21 notes left.)

1500
00:47:18,141 --> 00:47:19,875
- It's a corn snack. - Great!

1501
00:47:20,241 --> 00:47:21,269
I'm full.

1502
00:47:21,270 --> 00:47:22,392
It's too sweet.

1503
00:47:22,411 --> 00:47:23,610
There are not many left.

1504
00:47:23,611 --> 00:47:25,039
- Next question. - Here we go.

1505
00:47:25,040 --> 00:47:26,610
We asked elementary school students,

1506
00:47:26,611 --> 00:47:29,508
"What do you want to hear from your parents the most?"

1507
00:47:29,710 --> 00:47:32,373
Number five was, "You can play with your phone."

1508
00:47:32,420 --> 00:47:33,419
Okay.

1509
00:47:33,420 --> 00:47:35,119
Number four was, "Do you want more money?"

1510
00:47:35,120 --> 00:47:37,507
Number three was, "You can skip your lessons today."

1511
00:47:37,560 --> 00:47:40,059
Number two was, "I love you."

1512
00:47:40,060 --> 00:47:41,059
Really?

1513
00:47:41,060 --> 00:47:42,059
What's number one?

1514
00:47:42,060 --> 00:47:43,289
- Pretty Boys! - Pretty Boys!

1515
00:47:43,290 --> 00:47:44,360
Pretty Boys.

1516
00:47:44,361 --> 00:47:45,452
"You can go to the Internet cafe."

1517
00:47:45,861 --> 00:47:46,899
Baby!

1518
00:47:46,900 --> 00:47:47,992
(Wrong answer)

1519
00:47:48,400 --> 00:47:49,669
"You can watch Running Man."

1520
00:47:49,670 --> 00:47:51,439
("You can watch Running Man".)

1521
00:47:51,440 --> 00:47:52,828
I wish it was, but it's the wrong answer.

1522
00:47:53,071 --> 00:47:54,601
Cute and Small!

1523
00:47:55,940 --> 00:47:57,542
"This house is under your name."

1524
00:47:57,980 --> 00:47:59,740
(He's approaching completely from an adult's point of view.)

1525
00:47:59,741 --> 00:48:01,510
Baby!

1526
00:48:01,511 --> 00:48:03,724
(I think I got it.)

1527
00:48:03,821 --> 00:48:04,902
"Be happy."

1528
00:48:05,281 --> 00:48:06,647
What?

1529
00:48:06,821 --> 00:48:09,249
(It's wrong, but all fathers are happy to have you.)

1530
00:48:09,250 --> 00:48:10,320
Pretty Boys!

1531
00:48:10,321 --> 00:48:12,619
(I think I got it too.)

1532
00:48:12,620 --> 00:48:13,854
"Thank you for being born."

1533
00:48:15,060 --> 00:48:17,099
I almost cried on that one.

1534
00:48:17,100 --> 00:48:18,160
(These fathers are about to cry.)

1535
00:48:18,161 --> 00:48:19,860
- Just be healthy. - Just be healthy.

1536
00:48:19,861 --> 00:48:21,130
Baby!

1537
00:48:21,131 --> 00:48:23,139
"Just be healthy. I don't care about your scores."

1538
00:48:23,230 --> 00:48:24,300
Pretty Boys!

1539
00:48:24,301 --> 00:48:25,669
Mom!

1540
00:48:25,670 --> 00:48:26,690
(Dads are feeling sad.)

1541
00:48:26,971 --> 00:48:29,570
(Are my kids watching this?)

1542
00:48:29,571 --> 00:48:31,550
Pretty Boys! "Do you want to go on a trip"?

1543
00:48:31,881 --> 00:48:33,610
- No. Wait. - Baby!

1544
00:48:33,611 --> 00:48:34,849
(It was correct.)

1545
00:48:34,850 --> 00:48:36,209
- Yes! - That was the answer.

1546
00:48:36,210 --> 00:48:38,873
(It's a dad's superpower.)

1547
00:48:39,150 --> 00:48:40,649
Isn't it, "Let's go on a trip".

1548
00:48:40,650 --> 00:48:41,849
Number one was, "Let's go on a trip".

1549
00:48:41,850 --> 00:48:44,890
This is really sad.

1550
00:48:44,891 --> 00:48:47,930
We're all too busy. Both parents go to work,

1551
00:48:47,931 --> 00:48:49,789
and we don't have time to be with them.

1552
00:48:49,790 --> 00:48:51,739
They could draw the winning note.

1553
00:48:52,100 --> 00:48:53,260
Let's end this game now.

1554
00:48:53,261 --> 00:48:54,729
- How about this one? - This one?

1555
00:48:54,730 --> 00:48:56,199
- This one. - You two choose.

1556
00:48:56,301 --> 00:48:57,570
Let's go.

1557
00:48:57,571 --> 00:48:59,439
(Their odds to draw the winning note is 1 in 21.)

1558
00:48:59,440 --> 00:49:01,889
I hope it's the one. Let's win this, Dong Hwi.

1559
00:49:02,511 --> 00:49:03,734
What is it?

1560
00:49:05,310 --> 00:49:06,880
Give me a whistle candy.

1561
00:49:06,881 --> 00:49:08,544
(Give me a whistle candy.)

1562
00:49:08,611 --> 00:49:09,610
(We got the most correct answers.)

1563
00:49:09,611 --> 00:49:11,680
We got the most correct answers.

1564
00:49:11,681 --> 00:49:13,281
- What is it? - Another snack?

1565
00:49:13,381 --> 00:49:14,849
- It's candy. - It's a whistle candy.

1566
00:49:14,850 --> 00:49:16,220
Right. That one.

1567
00:49:16,221 --> 00:49:17,587
I ate that a lot.

1568
00:49:17,721 --> 00:49:20,119
Here's another survey question.

1569
00:49:20,120 --> 00:49:21,590
- Good. - Survey.

1570
00:49:21,591 --> 00:49:23,530
"What do you do..."

1571
00:49:23,531 --> 00:49:26,130
"before you open the bathroom door?"

1572
00:49:26,131 --> 00:49:27,130
Baby!

1573
00:49:27,131 --> 00:49:28,599
(Without hesitation)

1574
00:49:28,600 --> 00:49:30,405
- Go ahead. - Before opening the door?

1575
00:49:30,670 --> 00:49:31,840
"Hold my nose".

1576
00:49:31,841 --> 00:49:33,039
- Cute and Small! - That was cute though.

1577
00:49:33,040 --> 00:49:34,369
- Cute and Small! - Cute and Small!

1578
00:49:34,370 --> 00:49:36,003
"Turn the lights on."

1579
00:49:36,411 --> 00:49:38,780
Pretty Boys. "Take my pants off."

1580
00:49:38,781 --> 00:49:40,140
(I got a good feeling about this.)

1581
00:49:40,141 --> 00:49:41,406
Before you open the door?

1582
00:49:42,150 --> 00:49:43,479
You take them off and open the door?

1583
00:49:43,480 --> 00:49:44,519
Baby!

1584
00:49:44,520 --> 00:49:45,680
It was really close.

1585
00:49:45,681 --> 00:49:47,090
Baby! "Open the zipper."

1586
00:49:47,091 --> 00:49:48,890
(I got it.)

1587
00:49:48,891 --> 00:49:49,911
Okay.

1588
00:49:50,020 --> 00:49:52,090
Yes, you have to get ready.

1589
00:49:52,091 --> 00:49:53,490
They open their zippers?

1590
00:49:53,491 --> 00:49:54,714
Before they open the door?

1591
00:49:54,861 --> 00:49:56,430
It says, "Open my zippers."

1592
00:49:56,431 --> 00:49:57,630
(It's tough to guess from an adult's point of view.)

1593
00:49:57,631 --> 00:49:58,660
This is the one I told Haha...

1594
00:49:58,661 --> 00:50:00,129
to pick from the beginning.

1595
00:50:00,201 --> 00:50:01,700
- Really? - Please.

1596
00:50:01,701 --> 00:50:03,670
(Jong Kook have chosen this from the beginning.)

1597
00:50:03,900 --> 00:50:08,867
(He chose the one in the bottom and on the left.)

1598
00:50:09,611 --> 00:50:11,380
(He's going for the note he chose.)

1599
00:50:11,381 --> 00:50:13,039
- Please. - It'd be awesome if it is.

1600
00:50:13,040 --> 00:50:14,450
(If he's right,)

1601
00:50:14,451 --> 00:50:15,849
- Please. - Please.

1602
00:50:15,850 --> 00:50:19,619
(they'll win and earn 3 syllables.)

1603
00:50:19,620 --> 00:50:20,789
It's a noodle snack.

1604
00:50:20,790 --> 00:50:22,189
(It's a noodle snack.)

1605
00:50:22,190 --> 00:50:23,649
(He was completely lost.)

1606
00:50:23,650 --> 00:50:25,293
You don't even eat noodles!

1607
00:50:25,321 --> 00:50:27,473
(They can't say anything because it's Jong Kook.)

1608
00:50:27,931 --> 00:50:30,001
(He's embarrassed.)

1609
00:50:30,161 --> 00:50:31,863
You don't even eat noodles!

1610
00:50:32,100 --> 00:50:34,030
We have to get it this time.

1611
00:50:34,031 --> 00:50:35,869
We have to.

1612
00:50:35,870 --> 00:50:39,206
(They seem awkward all of a sudden.)

1613
00:50:39,500 --> 00:50:41,369
Here we go again.

1614
00:50:41,370 --> 00:50:43,140
It's another cartoon theme song.

1615
00:50:43,141 --> 00:50:45,079
- Again? - Yes. Listen.

1616
00:50:45,080 --> 00:50:46,780
(Listen to the song and guess the title of the cartoon.)

1617
00:50:46,781 --> 00:50:50,453
(This song that everyone is familiar with is...)

1618
00:50:50,650 --> 00:50:52,479
(from "Tongki, the King of Dodgeball")

1619
00:50:52,480 --> 00:50:55,050
(All children imitated many scenes from this cartoon.)

1620
00:50:55,051 --> 00:50:58,560
(They instantly realize what it is.)

1621
00:50:58,721 --> 00:50:59,860
- Let me answer. No, Baby! - Pretty Boys!

1622
00:50:59,861 --> 00:51:01,430
(Jong Kook didn't shout their slogan.)

1623
00:51:01,431 --> 00:51:04,729
(What will Jae Seok's answer be?)

1624
00:51:04,730 --> 00:51:05,760
"Moero! Top Striker"?

1625
00:51:05,761 --> 00:51:07,127
(It was completely wrong.)

1626
00:51:07,471 --> 00:51:08,729
"Moero! Top Striker"?

1627
00:51:08,730 --> 00:51:11,999
(Jong Kook has a chance, and he shouted out the answer.)

1628
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:15,910
(It's a very famous song. Will he get the correct answer?)

1629
00:51:15,911 --> 00:51:17,340
"Dodge Top Striker".

1630
00:51:17,341 --> 00:51:21,533
("Dodge Top Striker". What did he just say?)

1631
00:51:22,580 --> 00:51:23,680
Jong Kook...

1632
00:51:23,681 --> 00:51:24,919
(It's "Tongki, the King of Dodgeball".)

1633
00:51:24,920 --> 00:51:26,042
Cute and Small!

1634
00:51:26,381 --> 00:51:28,789
("Moero! Top Striker"? "Dodge Top Striker"?)

1635
00:51:28,790 --> 00:51:30,352
Cute and Small!

1636
00:51:30,620 --> 00:51:32,119
- Cute and Small! - Go on.

1637
00:51:32,120 --> 00:51:33,360
- "Tongki, the King of Dodgeball". - He's right!

1638
00:51:33,361 --> 00:51:36,114
("Tongki, the King of Dodgeball" is correct.)

1639
00:51:36,690 --> 00:51:39,312
(It was really easy for him thanks to the other two.)

1640
00:51:39,500 --> 00:51:41,102
I said "Dodge Top Striker".

1641
00:51:42,900 --> 00:51:45,144
- I knew the answer. - You were confused.

1642
00:51:45,870 --> 00:51:46,970
I knew it.

1643
00:51:46,971 --> 00:51:48,769
I was confused because of you!

1644
00:51:48,770 --> 00:51:51,809
(The sun rises up)

1645
00:51:51,810 --> 00:51:54,979
(The sea spreads endlessly)

1646
00:51:54,980 --> 00:51:56,910
(Let's just sing.)

1647
00:51:56,911 --> 00:51:58,050
I was so close.

1648
00:51:58,051 --> 00:52:01,722
(Breathe in the fresh air Let's all go for a run)

1649
00:52:01,920 --> 00:52:04,090
(He dances like an old man.)

1650
00:52:04,091 --> 00:52:05,459
Why did I say that?

1651
00:52:05,460 --> 00:52:06,848
You were confused by Jae Seok.

1652
00:52:07,991 --> 00:52:10,800
(The best dodgeball player In the world)

1653
00:52:10,801 --> 00:52:12,800
- Fiery throw! - Fiery throw!

1654
00:52:12,801 --> 00:52:14,430
I got it thanks to Jong Kook.

1655
00:52:14,431 --> 00:52:16,002
Right.

1656
00:52:16,301 --> 00:52:17,729
- Go for it. - We can do this.

1657
00:52:17,900 --> 00:52:19,430
Go ahead.

1658
00:52:19,600 --> 00:52:21,269
(They let Ji Hyo choose.)

1659
00:52:21,270 --> 00:52:22,910
(Their odds to draw the winning note is 1 in 19.)

1660
00:52:22,911 --> 00:52:26,180
(Will she get lucky again?)

1661
00:52:26,181 --> 00:52:27,209
"Number 1".

1662
00:52:27,210 --> 00:52:30,010
(She picked the Number 1 note.)

1663
00:52:30,011 --> 00:52:31,142
- Okay! - Yes!

1664
00:52:31,321 --> 00:52:33,149
- Did she draw it? - We won.

1665
00:52:33,150 --> 00:52:34,445
Ji Hyo picked it?

1666
00:52:34,790 --> 00:52:36,050
This is awesome.

1667
00:52:36,051 --> 00:52:37,459
We did it.

1668
00:52:37,460 --> 00:52:38,660
- We were... - When you said,

1669
00:52:38,661 --> 00:52:40,689
"Moero! Top Striker", I was laughing at you.

1670
00:52:40,690 --> 00:52:44,300
I came up with the correct title, but it didn't come out.

1671
00:52:44,301 --> 00:52:45,382
It was so close.

1672
00:52:45,600 --> 00:52:48,070
Imagine if So Min or I said "Dodge Top Striker".

1673
00:52:48,071 --> 00:52:50,314
(Then you won't get away with it easily.)

1674
00:52:50,670 --> 00:52:51,700
- We did it. - She did it.

1675
00:52:51,701 --> 00:52:52,769
It's all thanks to Ji Hyo.

1676
00:52:52,770 --> 00:52:53,923
(They won thanks to Ji Hyo.)

1677
00:52:54,141 --> 00:52:55,169
(Team This Guy is winning with 4 syllables.)

1678
00:52:55,170 --> 00:52:57,210
Team This Guy has won...

1679
00:52:57,480 --> 00:52:58,880
- this round. - Good.

1680
00:52:58,881 --> 00:53:00,280
You may choose three syllables.

1681
00:53:00,281 --> 00:53:02,149
- 3 syllables! - 3 syllables.

1682
00:53:02,150 --> 00:53:03,649
There's still chance...

1683
00:53:03,650 --> 00:53:05,220
for Seok Jin to face the penalty.

1684
00:53:05,221 --> 00:53:06,419
Here's a suggestion.

1685
00:53:06,420 --> 00:53:08,052
We play rock-paper-scissors for each word.

1686
00:53:08,221 --> 00:53:09,919
You're being greedy.

1687
00:53:09,920 --> 00:53:11,083
We're getting three syllables.

1688
00:53:11,161 --> 00:53:12,760
If I win, I'm only choosing my name.

1689
00:53:12,761 --> 00:53:13,789
- Yes. - Okay.

1690
00:53:13,790 --> 00:53:14,983
- Rock-paper-scissors! - Rock-paper-scissors!

1691
00:53:15,161 --> 00:53:16,926
(This Guy has lost.)

1692
00:53:17,131 --> 00:53:18,499
(Why do I lose every time?)

1693
00:53:18,500 --> 00:53:19,559
Why do I lose every time?

1694
00:53:19,560 --> 00:53:20,580
One word for each win?

1695
00:53:20,730 --> 00:53:23,599
Rock-paper-scissors! Rock-paper-scissors!

1696
00:53:23,600 --> 00:53:25,682
(Kwang Soo naturally loses.)

1697
00:53:26,440 --> 00:53:28,410
(It's not a surprising result for the unlucky members.)

1698
00:53:28,411 --> 00:53:30,610
- Ji Hyo won again. Ji Hyo, choose. - Choose a syllable.

1699
00:53:30,611 --> 00:53:32,410
- "Hyo". - She is done.

1700
00:53:32,411 --> 00:53:34,910
Song Ji Hyo retrieves her name. She will get her name tag.

1701
00:53:34,911 --> 00:53:36,079
Ji Hyo.

1702
00:53:36,080 --> 00:53:38,630
- Ji Hyo is unbelievable. - I am jealous.

1703
00:53:38,721 --> 00:53:40,486
- Congratulations. - Thank you.

1704
00:53:41,190 --> 00:53:43,088
I finally got my name back.

1705
00:53:43,391 --> 00:53:44,390
Let's play rock-paper-scissors.

1706
00:53:44,391 --> 00:53:45,459
Rock-paper-scissors!

1707
00:53:45,460 --> 00:53:46,959
(Between the Unlucky Brothers, Kwang Soo will choose first.)

1708
00:53:46,960 --> 00:53:47,980
Okay!

1709
00:53:48,431 --> 00:53:49,788
- Pick a syllable. - "Lee".

1710
00:53:49,891 --> 00:53:51,360
- "Lee". - You got a syllable back.

1711
00:53:51,361 --> 00:53:53,707
- You got a syllable back. - "Lee".

1712
00:53:54,701 --> 00:53:56,058
- I will choose... - Kwang Soo got his name back.

1713
00:53:56,531 --> 00:53:57,795
Does anyone has "Jin" in his or her name?

1714
00:53:58,100 --> 00:53:59,499
No, no one does.

1715
00:53:59,500 --> 00:54:01,551
- "Jin". - Choose "Seok" instead.

1716
00:54:01,710 --> 00:54:02,709
Okay.

1717
00:54:02,710 --> 00:54:05,944
We will now move for the last round.

1718
00:54:06,710 --> 00:54:08,209
- This is driving me crazy. - I lost my chance.

1719
00:54:08,210 --> 00:54:09,410
Seriously.

1720
00:54:09,411 --> 00:54:11,318
(Ji Hyo and Kwang Soo found their names.)

1721
00:54:12,150 --> 00:54:13,619
As you know,

1722
00:54:13,620 --> 00:54:15,390
to complete the team members' names,

1723
00:54:15,391 --> 00:54:18,828
Team This Guy has one syllable to go.

1724
00:54:19,190 --> 00:54:22,430
Please stop calling us That Guy and Hey, There.

1725
00:54:22,431 --> 00:54:25,700
(Kwang Soo and Ji Hyo completed their names.)

1726
00:54:25,701 --> 00:54:28,219
Kwang Soo, Ji Hyo, and This Guy.

1727
00:54:29,100 --> 00:54:32,169
(This Guy hasn't found his name.)

1728
00:54:32,170 --> 00:54:35,200
Since This Guy is the team leader, they should be Team This Guy.

1729
00:54:35,540 --> 00:54:36,709
- That's right. - Team This Guy.

1730
00:54:36,710 --> 00:54:39,410
Unless Seok Jin completes his name,

1731
00:54:39,411 --> 00:54:40,809
he will receive a penalty.

1732
00:54:40,810 --> 00:54:43,110
You are right, but the odds are in my favor.

1733
00:54:43,111 --> 00:54:44,450
- Think about it. - You are right.

1734
00:54:44,451 --> 00:54:45,519
That won't make any sense.

1735
00:54:45,520 --> 00:54:47,285
They will help me.

1736
00:54:47,520 --> 00:54:48,749
Team Child...

1737
00:54:48,750 --> 00:54:51,119
- We need 7 syllables. - That's right. 7 syllables.

1738
00:54:51,120 --> 00:54:52,160
The last round...

1739
00:54:52,161 --> 00:54:54,990
will let you obtain as many syllables as you want.

1740
00:54:54,991 --> 00:54:57,652
- It's Beep Beep Bicycle. - Beep Beep Bicycle?

1741
00:54:58,400 --> 00:55:00,599
The buildable bicycles you see over there...

1742
00:55:00,600 --> 00:55:03,800
have three balloons each.

1743
00:55:03,801 --> 00:55:05,882
Each time...

1744
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:09,410
you pop other team member's balloon on a bicycle,

1745
00:55:09,411 --> 00:55:11,145
you will obtain a syllable.

1746
00:55:11,881 --> 00:55:13,809
Pop one balloon.

1747
00:55:13,810 --> 00:55:15,748
- We just need one balloon. - That's right.

1748
00:55:16,281 --> 00:55:18,180
- We need... - What you need...

1749
00:55:18,181 --> 00:55:19,979
are a bicycle,

1750
00:55:19,980 --> 00:55:20,990
balloons,

1751
00:55:20,991 --> 00:55:23,890
and a toy hammer you can use to pop the balloons.

1752
00:55:23,891 --> 00:55:26,459
- Okay. - Now, a member from each team...

1753
00:55:26,460 --> 00:55:27,630
will get in the cable car...

1754
00:55:27,631 --> 00:55:30,729
and have a match. The top one will get a good tool...

1755
00:55:30,730 --> 00:55:33,360
and the top three will get a bad tool.

1756
00:55:33,361 --> 00:55:35,070
It's one on one on one match.

1757
00:55:35,071 --> 00:55:36,300
It's an individual event.

1758
00:55:36,301 --> 00:55:37,369
- Now, step forward... - Okay.

1759
00:55:37,370 --> 00:55:40,226
if you want to participate in the toy hammer match.

1760
00:55:40,471 --> 00:55:41,809
One,

1761
00:55:41,810 --> 00:55:43,372
- 2, 3. - You should do it.

1762
00:55:44,011 --> 00:55:45,266
Nice.

1763
00:55:45,641 --> 00:55:46,809
One...

1764
00:55:46,810 --> 00:55:49,157
(Who else will compete for the toy hammer?)

1765
00:55:49,611 --> 00:55:52,880
(A weakling versus an ace member versus a weakling)

1766
00:55:52,881 --> 00:55:54,619
You can win.

1767
00:55:54,620 --> 00:55:56,090
- The toy hammer is important. - Ji Hyo...

1768
00:55:56,091 --> 00:55:57,760
found her name!

1769
00:55:57,761 --> 00:55:59,459
- I know. - I have a team member who hasn't.

1770
00:55:59,460 --> 00:56:02,459
Ji Hyo isn't going to be passionate about this.

1771
00:56:02,460 --> 00:56:03,990
Ji Hyo, my name isn't complete yet.

1772
00:56:03,991 --> 00:56:05,360
- Don't do this half-heartedly. - Of course not.

1773
00:56:05,361 --> 00:56:06,700
Do this half-heartedly, Ji Hyo.

1774
00:56:06,701 --> 00:56:09,078
- Don't do this half-heartedly. - Of course not.

1775
00:56:09,100 --> 00:56:10,970
- Three. - Jong Kook, go.

1776
00:56:10,971 --> 00:56:13,200
(The list of other matches are complete.)

1777
00:56:13,201 --> 00:56:15,070
This isn't half bad.

1778
00:56:15,071 --> 00:56:16,110
Hey.

1779
00:56:16,111 --> 00:56:17,340
(Balloon: Se Chan, Seok Jin, and Jong Kook)

1780
00:56:17,341 --> 00:56:18,510
(Bicycle: Dong Hwi, Kwang Soo, and So Min)

1781
00:56:18,511 --> 00:56:19,610
- Okay. - Okay.

1782
00:56:19,611 --> 00:56:22,110
Gosh, why is the bottom clear?

1783
00:56:22,111 --> 00:56:23,709
(The bottom is clear.)

1784
00:56:23,710 --> 00:56:25,019
This is...

1785
00:56:25,020 --> 00:56:26,280
This is scary.

1786
00:56:26,281 --> 00:56:27,820
I can't do this. I need to sit at the edge.

1787
00:56:27,821 --> 00:56:30,249
- Jae Seok, come here. - Ji Hyo, I can't sit in the middle.

1788
00:56:30,250 --> 00:56:32,959
- It's so scary. - I can't look at the bottom.

1789
00:56:32,960 --> 00:56:35,510
Why did they make us ride a cable car with the clear bottom?

1790
00:56:35,631 --> 00:56:36,813
Shall we go?

1791
00:56:36,891 --> 00:56:38,839
Why is the bottom clear?

1792
00:56:38,900 --> 00:56:40,909
Will we play a game in here?

1793
00:56:41,000 --> 00:56:42,530
How will we play a game?

1794
00:56:42,531 --> 00:56:44,470
- We need to be careful. - You are always anxious.

1795
00:56:44,471 --> 00:56:46,169
The bottom is...

1796
00:56:46,170 --> 00:56:47,510
(What kind of match will unfold in the cable bar?)

1797
00:56:47,511 --> 00:56:49,640
Gosh, this is unbelievable.

1798
00:56:49,641 --> 00:56:51,880
This is incredible. The view beneath us is incredible.

1799
00:56:51,881 --> 00:56:54,249
Why would you look down?

1800
00:56:54,250 --> 00:56:57,550
(Their four eyes look into the distance.)

1801
00:56:57,551 --> 00:56:59,519
- My goodness. - Look into the distance.

1802
00:56:59,520 --> 00:57:00,550
My goodness.

1803
00:57:00,551 --> 00:57:02,490
- The view beneath us is incredible. - Why did you pick this cable car?

1804
00:57:02,491 --> 00:57:05,173
- My goodness. - Thank goodness Jae Seok is here.

1805
00:57:05,491 --> 00:57:07,059
He understands me.

1806
00:57:07,060 --> 00:57:08,213
(I'm glad that you're here too.)

1807
00:57:09,060 --> 00:57:12,325
- How nice! - How nice!

1808
00:57:13,460 --> 00:57:16,428
This ride will be amazing with a lover.

1809
00:57:16,631 --> 00:57:17,999
This is incredible.

1810
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:19,674
This is incredible.

1811
00:57:20,241 --> 00:57:22,351
The view is amazing.

1812
00:57:22,440 --> 00:57:24,420
The view will be great at night too.

1813
00:57:24,580 --> 00:57:26,610
Look at the view. It's incredible.

1814
00:57:26,611 --> 00:57:29,010
It will be great to come here with the family.

1815
00:57:29,011 --> 00:57:31,450
It's perfect in this weather.

1816
00:57:31,451 --> 00:57:33,420
I wish I could come here with my mom.

1817
00:57:34,350 --> 00:57:35,819
Hurrah!

1818
00:57:37,221 --> 00:57:38,241
This feels so good.

1819
00:57:38,520 --> 00:57:41,214
The view is really nice.

1820
00:57:41,690 --> 00:57:42,990
What's the game?

1821
00:57:42,991 --> 00:57:46,500
Your mission to obtain the toy hammers...

1822
00:57:46,600 --> 00:57:48,640
is Open the Children's Book.

1823
00:57:48,801 --> 00:57:50,126
It must be about the number of people on the page.

1824
00:57:50,471 --> 00:57:52,276
I am good at this. Okay.

1825
00:57:52,600 --> 00:57:53,998
I am not really good at this.

1826
00:57:54,370 --> 00:57:56,910
Pick a children's book.

1827
00:57:56,911 --> 00:57:58,479
We will play rock-paper-scissors.

1828
00:57:58,480 --> 00:57:59,532
Rock-paper-scissors!

1829
00:57:59,641 --> 00:58:00,910
(Haha gets the right to choose first!)

1830
00:58:00,911 --> 00:58:03,249
- Okay. - Rock-paper-scissors!

1831
00:58:03,250 --> 00:58:04,919
(Ji Hyo is next.)

1832
00:58:04,920 --> 00:58:06,880
Did you have to win?

1833
00:58:06,881 --> 00:58:08,649
(You found your name.)

1834
00:58:08,650 --> 00:58:11,390
Did you have to win when you found your name, Ji Hyo?

1835
00:58:11,391 --> 00:58:14,689
Jae Seok, the view is incredible under your feet.

1836
00:58:14,690 --> 00:58:17,547
This is crazy. I got a look.

1837
00:58:17,830 --> 00:58:19,055
Hurry up.

1838
00:58:19,100 --> 00:58:20,999
I will choose "The Most Precious..." That one.

1839
00:58:21,000 --> 00:58:22,430
I will choose the pink one.

1840
00:58:22,431 --> 00:58:24,643
- "I Had a Scary Dream Again". - "I Had a Scary Dream Again".

1841
00:58:25,000 --> 00:58:27,169
It's your turn, Ji Hyo. In 1, 2, 3.

1842
00:58:27,170 --> 00:58:28,740
(You need to get...)

1843
00:58:28,741 --> 00:58:31,158
(the most number of people on the page to win.)

1844
00:58:32,480 --> 00:58:34,280
1, 2. 2 people.

1845
00:58:34,281 --> 00:58:36,610
Two people with their faces showing.

1846
00:58:36,611 --> 00:58:37,640
It's my turn.

1847
00:58:38,051 --> 00:58:41,152
(If he gets less than 2 people, he will lose.)

1848
00:58:41,620 --> 00:58:43,390
- 4 people. - 4 people.

1849
00:58:43,391 --> 00:58:45,390
(Jae Seok's page has 4 people.)

1850
00:58:45,391 --> 00:58:46,991
This is no joke.

1851
00:58:47,190 --> 00:58:48,459
Please, please.

1852
00:58:48,460 --> 00:58:49,459
(If Haha gets more than 4 people. he will win.)

1853
00:58:49,460 --> 00:58:50,789
In 1, 2, 3.

1854
00:58:50,790 --> 00:58:52,534
(What will be Haha's result?)

1855
00:58:54,900 --> 00:58:57,070
- No one? - No, no. Look.

1856
00:58:57,071 --> 00:58:58,366
(There are people on the page.)

1857
00:58:59,071 --> 00:59:02,169
(Everything is in shadow.)

1858
00:59:02,170 --> 00:59:03,439
No, no. Look. Look.

1859
00:59:03,440 --> 00:59:04,880
- They don't count. - They are people.

1860
00:59:04,881 --> 00:59:06,880
They are shadows, not people.

1861
00:59:06,881 --> 00:59:08,749
- Then I have three people. - They are people.

1862
00:59:08,750 --> 00:59:11,479
Let me go again. I didn't know.

1863
00:59:11,480 --> 00:59:13,919
- Their faces aren't visible. - You didn't tell me the rules.

1864
00:59:13,920 --> 00:59:14,919
Go again.

1865
00:59:14,920 --> 00:59:17,619
On Ji Hyo's page, we didn't count the figure without a face.

1866
00:59:17,620 --> 00:59:19,490
- That's right. - So the face must be visible.

1867
00:59:19,491 --> 00:59:21,430
- The face must be visible. - Okay.

1868
00:59:21,431 --> 00:59:22,860
Then only you should go again.

1869
00:59:22,861 --> 00:59:24,462
Okay. I will go again.

1870
00:59:25,431 --> 00:59:28,070
In 1, 2,

1871
00:59:28,071 --> 00:59:29,326
- 3. - 3.

1872
00:59:29,971 --> 00:59:31,240
Okay. Three people.

1873
00:59:31,241 --> 00:59:32,669
(3 people?)

1874
00:59:33,241 --> 00:59:34,510
(Haha's page has 3 people.)

1875
00:59:34,511 --> 00:59:36,269
- I won! - For goodness' sake.

1876
00:59:36,270 --> 00:59:37,913
(He figures out the situation belatedly.)

1877
00:59:38,511 --> 00:59:41,979
(Jae Seok wins with 4 people and Haha loses with 3 people.)

1878
00:59:42,281 --> 00:59:45,239
- The winner is Jae Seok. - Yes!

1879
00:59:46,451 --> 00:59:48,388
- I will explain the rules. - Okay.

1880
00:59:48,650 --> 00:59:50,119
The mission for balloon size is...

1881
00:59:50,120 --> 00:59:52,670
Kiss the Beautiful Scenery.

1882
00:59:53,261 --> 00:59:54,260
- What? - Kiss?

1883
00:59:54,261 --> 00:59:56,331
(They feel awkward for no reason.)

1884
00:59:56,491 --> 00:59:58,235
- What? Do we need to kiss? - Kiss?

1885
00:59:58,460 --> 00:59:59,630
- No way. - No way.

1886
00:59:59,631 --> 01:00:01,869
We don't need to kiss each other, do we?

1887
01:00:01,870 --> 01:00:04,070
Apply lipstick on your lips...

1888
01:00:04,071 --> 01:00:07,202
and open your mouth widely to stamp your lips.

1889
01:00:07,241 --> 01:00:09,618
The person who leaves the biggest mark is the winner.

1890
01:00:10,571 --> 01:00:12,825
- Okay. - His mouth is...

1891
01:00:13,011 --> 01:00:14,880
- Look at the mirror. - Look at the mirror.

1892
01:00:14,881 --> 01:00:17,195
- Look at the scenery. - The scenery is nice.

1893
01:00:17,350 --> 01:00:18,370
The scenery.

1894
01:00:18,850 --> 01:00:21,503
(He docks his lips on an acrylic board.)

1895
01:00:21,951 --> 01:00:23,720
(He gives up on his looks in order to win.)

1896
01:00:23,721 --> 01:00:25,802
Once you stamp your lips, it's over.

1897
01:00:26,690 --> 01:00:27,990
- Okay. - It's not bad.

1898
01:00:27,991 --> 01:00:31,459
- Okay. - It's not bad. For goodness' sake.

1899
01:00:31,460 --> 01:00:33,860
Okay. It's not bad at all.

1900
01:00:33,861 --> 01:00:35,023
(Don't do so well.)

1901
01:00:35,471 --> 01:00:36,630
- Let's go. - Let's go.

1902
01:00:36,631 --> 01:00:38,171
Come on.

1903
01:00:38,471 --> 01:00:40,479
- Make a big mark. - That's good.

1904
01:00:41,141 --> 01:00:42,161
My goodness.

1905
01:00:43,141 --> 01:00:44,340
That's incredible.

1906
01:00:44,341 --> 01:00:45,740
You did it nicely.

1907
01:00:45,741 --> 01:00:47,309
(His mark is as big as his face.)

1908
01:00:47,310 --> 01:00:49,494
I want to write letters in here.

1909
01:00:49,710 --> 01:00:51,893
- It's like a parenthesis. - I know.

1910
01:00:52,020 --> 01:00:54,500
- I hope I don't come in last. - Here I go.

1911
01:00:54,650 --> 01:00:56,120
His mouth is big.

1912
01:00:59,420 --> 01:01:01,266
What is he doing?

1913
01:01:01,730 --> 01:01:04,790
(His lips are about to rip.)

1914
01:01:05,730 --> 01:01:07,025
I got the two ends.

1915
01:01:07,400 --> 01:01:08,399
This is hard.

1916
01:01:08,400 --> 01:01:10,205
Did I do it wrong?

1917
01:01:10,931 --> 01:01:13,099
I will measure til the inside.

1918
01:01:13,100 --> 01:01:14,970
That's only fair.

1919
01:01:14,971 --> 01:01:16,910
- Whose is this? - 6.5cm.

1920
01:01:16,911 --> 01:01:18,610
Seok Jin's is 6.5cm.

1921
01:01:18,611 --> 01:01:19,709
6.5cm.

1922
01:01:19,710 --> 01:01:21,067
How did I do?

1923
01:01:21,111 --> 01:01:22,280
This is bad.

1924
01:01:22,281 --> 01:01:23,809
Mine isn't half bad.

1925
01:01:23,810 --> 01:01:26,280
- I... - My goodness, Seok Jin.

1926
01:01:26,281 --> 01:01:27,576
7.5cm.

1927
01:01:27,750 --> 01:01:29,485
Right? 7.5cm.

1928
01:01:29,750 --> 01:01:31,090
I didn't do it right.

1929
01:01:31,091 --> 01:01:32,111
(He is nervous.)

1930
01:01:32,420 --> 01:01:34,776
- I didn't do it right. - Yours doesn't look bad.

1931
01:01:35,261 --> 01:01:36,959
- Let's go. - My goodness.

1932
01:01:36,960 --> 01:01:38,867
- 6.5cm and 7.5cm. - Mine is 6.5cm.

1933
01:01:39,100 --> 01:01:40,099
Hey.

1934
01:01:40,100 --> 01:01:43,099
(He stretched his lips to his limit.)

1935
01:01:43,100 --> 01:01:47,283
(What will be Jong Kook's measurement?)

1936
01:01:47,370 --> 01:01:50,010
- Hey. It's 6.8cm. - Yes!

1937
01:01:50,011 --> 01:01:51,640
- 6.8cm. - Okay!

1938
01:01:51,641 --> 01:01:53,375
(Jong Kook's measurement is 6.8cm.)

1939
01:01:54,611 --> 01:01:56,141
- My goodness. - 6.8cm.

1940
01:01:56,480 --> 01:01:57,709
- All right. - Okay.

1941
01:01:57,710 --> 01:01:59,180
Okay.

1942
01:01:59,181 --> 01:02:00,547
(Team This Guy will get big balloons that are disadvantageous.)

1943
01:02:00,821 --> 01:02:03,019
Your mission will decide...

1944
01:02:03,020 --> 01:02:04,760
- on the bicycle. - Yes.

1945
01:02:04,761 --> 01:02:06,903
The mission to obtain the bicycles...

1946
01:02:07,091 --> 01:02:11,499
- is the Shark Teeth of Chance. - It's a game of chance.

1947
01:02:11,500 --> 01:02:14,160
I was going to go easy on Kwang Soo.

1948
01:02:14,161 --> 01:02:15,599
- I won't be able to do that. - It's a game of chance.

1949
01:02:15,600 --> 01:02:16,999
I will explain the rules briefly.

1950
01:02:17,000 --> 01:02:20,070
You will take turns to take out a bait at a time.

1951
01:02:20,071 --> 01:02:22,865
The person who gets bitten loses.

1952
01:02:23,111 --> 01:02:25,240
A member of the loser's team...

1953
01:02:25,241 --> 01:02:27,110
will get a tricycle.

1954
01:02:27,111 --> 01:02:29,610
- It's just the loser, right? - That's right.

1955
01:02:29,611 --> 01:02:32,519
Now, decide on an order and take turns.

1956
01:02:32,520 --> 01:02:34,349
It might be more advantageous to go first.

1957
01:02:34,350 --> 01:02:35,990
Let's play rock-paper-scissors without Kwang Soo.

1958
01:02:35,991 --> 01:02:37,019
No, no. Hold on.

1959
01:02:37,020 --> 01:02:38,890
It won't hurt you in any way.

1960
01:02:38,891 --> 01:02:40,519
I still need to play fairly.

1961
01:02:40,520 --> 01:02:42,979
- I will play rock-paper-scissors. - Okay.

1962
01:02:43,060 --> 01:02:45,580
- Rock-paper-scissors! - Rock-paper-scissors!

1963
01:02:46,000 --> 01:02:48,245
(Dong Hwi will go last.)

1964
01:02:49,100 --> 01:02:50,498
Nothing is going well today.

1965
01:02:51,471 --> 01:02:52,561
- Rock-paper-scissors! - Rock-paper-scissors!

1966
01:02:54,270 --> 01:02:56,809
(Kwang Soo will go first.)

1967
01:02:56,810 --> 01:02:57,963
Go ahead.

1968
01:02:57,980 --> 01:02:59,479
I will take this one.

1969
01:02:59,480 --> 01:03:00,610
(He chooses daringly.)

1970
01:03:00,611 --> 01:03:01,709
I passed.

1971
01:03:01,710 --> 01:03:03,515
(So Min passes as well.)

1972
01:03:04,011 --> 01:03:05,720
The first round won't be a problem.

1973
01:03:05,721 --> 01:03:07,414
- We just need one loser. - I have a bad feeling.

1974
01:03:07,821 --> 01:03:08,912
I have...

1975
01:03:08,991 --> 01:03:11,234
(Clicking)

1976
01:03:11,520 --> 01:03:14,040
(The bait gets caught on its way out.)

1977
01:03:14,221 --> 01:03:15,229
(Did it get caught?)

1978
01:03:15,230 --> 01:03:16,250
That must be it.

1979
01:03:16,431 --> 01:03:18,260
(Could it be...)

1980
01:03:18,261 --> 01:03:19,994
(It comes out.)

1981
01:03:21,301 --> 01:03:24,391
(I'm relieved.)

1982
01:03:25,370 --> 01:03:28,140
(Does Kwang Soo suddenly get acrophobia?)

1983
01:03:28,141 --> 01:03:29,240
- Kwang Soo. - Kwang Soo.

1984
01:03:29,241 --> 01:03:30,699
Look before you pick one.

1985
01:03:31,841 --> 01:03:33,610
(I'm looking.)

1986
01:03:33,611 --> 01:03:34,631
Shall we put it on the floor?

1987
01:03:36,250 --> 01:03:37,249
Shall we put it on the floor?

1988
01:03:37,250 --> 01:03:38,280
(Why would you put it down?)

1989
01:03:38,281 --> 01:03:39,474
Pick one.

1990
01:03:39,480 --> 01:03:40,479
Pick one, Kwang Soo.

1991
01:03:40,480 --> 01:03:41,775
(The view makes him get acrophobia.)

1992
01:03:42,391 --> 01:03:43,789
(He's forced to pick.)

1993
01:03:43,790 --> 01:03:46,615
- Look before you pick one. - What are you doing?

1994
01:03:47,721 --> 01:03:48,829
(Snapping)

1995
01:03:48,830 --> 01:03:49,953
I knew it.

1996
01:03:50,631 --> 01:03:53,926
(The great white shark smells his unluckiness.)

1997
01:03:54,131 --> 01:03:55,430
The unluckiness never betrays you.

1998
01:03:55,431 --> 01:03:57,307
No one can replace him.

1999
01:03:57,330 --> 01:03:59,070
One member of your team...

2000
01:03:59,071 --> 01:04:00,294
will ride the tricycle.

2001
01:04:01,511 --> 01:04:02,766
You're in first place.

2002
01:04:03,511 --> 01:04:04,740
But...

2003
01:04:04,741 --> 01:04:05,863
Still...

2004
01:04:06,580 --> 01:04:07,662
It's over.

2005
01:04:07,841 --> 01:04:09,105
Do you want to try it for fun?

2006
01:04:09,881 --> 01:04:11,209
(Does he want to play for fun?)

2007
01:04:11,210 --> 01:04:13,291
Just pick one for fun.

2008
01:04:13,381 --> 01:04:14,720
What if the loser gets flicked on the forehead?

2009
01:04:14,721 --> 01:04:16,078
(How about this instead of playing for fun?)

2010
01:04:16,150 --> 01:04:17,620
- That sounds good. - A flick on the forehead.

2011
01:04:18,020 --> 01:04:19,520
- How will we flick? - With our hand.

2012
01:04:19,620 --> 01:04:21,294
- This one. - This?

2013
01:04:21,761 --> 01:04:22,959
Will you be okay?

2014
01:04:22,960 --> 01:04:24,590
- How about a punch? - A punch?

2015
01:04:24,591 --> 01:04:25,729
Okay, that sounds good.

2016
01:04:25,730 --> 01:04:26,959
- Really? - Punch.

2017
01:04:26,960 --> 01:04:28,099
Okay.

2018
01:04:28,100 --> 01:04:29,769
- Okay. - I'll pick first.

2019
01:04:29,770 --> 01:04:30,954
(They decide to play another round.)

2020
01:04:31,000 --> 01:04:32,300
(Dong Hwi)

2021
01:04:32,301 --> 01:04:33,470
(So Min)

2022
01:04:33,471 --> 01:04:35,669
(Everyone goes once.)

2023
01:04:35,670 --> 01:04:38,466
(They're getting nervous.)

2024
01:04:38,940 --> 01:04:40,675
(Dong Hwi passes.)

2025
01:04:41,781 --> 01:04:42,809
Pick one.

2026
01:04:42,810 --> 01:04:44,079
(It's Kwang Soo's turn again.)

2027
01:04:44,080 --> 01:04:45,180
I'm nervous.

2028
01:04:45,181 --> 01:04:47,567
(Clanking)

2029
01:04:48,451 --> 01:04:51,144
(He flinches as well.)

2030
01:04:51,290 --> 01:04:52,360
Good job.

2031
01:04:52,361 --> 01:04:53,419
(He really needs to ward off his unluckiness.)

2032
01:04:53,420 --> 01:04:54,789
How is this possible? Do you know which to pick?

2033
01:04:54,790 --> 01:04:55,829
The two of us will punch you.

2034
01:04:55,830 --> 01:04:56,860
Can you see it?

2035
01:04:56,861 --> 01:04:58,530
Both of us will punch you.

2036
01:04:58,531 --> 01:04:59,860
Don't be like that.

2037
01:04:59,861 --> 01:05:01,023
What?

2038
01:05:01,100 --> 01:05:02,130
Will you really punch me with a fist?

2039
01:05:02,131 --> 01:05:03,559
I changed it to punching.

2040
01:05:03,571 --> 01:05:05,172
Okay, I'll get punched.

2041
01:05:06,100 --> 01:05:07,169
Wait.

2042
01:05:07,170 --> 01:05:09,169
Hold your neck. It could hurt your neck.

2043
01:05:09,170 --> 01:05:10,209
Hold your neck.

2044
01:05:10,210 --> 01:05:12,424
Holding my neck won't be necessary.

2045
01:05:12,580 --> 01:05:14,682
(Punching)

2046
01:05:16,181 --> 01:05:19,282
(It's an explosive punch.)

2047
01:05:19,750 --> 01:05:22,789
(It sounded like something broke.)

2048
01:05:22,790 --> 01:05:24,789
(He feels dizzy.)

2049
01:05:24,790 --> 01:05:26,352
My goodness.

2050
01:05:26,491 --> 01:05:27,860
I never heard that sound from punching one.

2051
01:05:27,861 --> 01:05:28,912
(It's shocking.)

2052
01:05:29,230 --> 01:05:31,260
It sounded like a gourd was breaking.

2053
01:05:31,261 --> 01:05:32,423
It's your turn to punch.

2054
01:05:32,861 --> 01:05:34,391
Kwang Soo.

2055
01:05:34,661 --> 01:05:36,058
- It's okay. - Go ahead.

2056
01:05:36,100 --> 01:05:37,733
I suggested the punch, but...

2057
01:05:37,770 --> 01:05:39,575
- Go ahead. It's okay. - Really?

2058
01:05:39,701 --> 01:05:40,939
- But... - What should I do?

2059
01:05:40,940 --> 01:05:42,369
- My hand hurts. - What should I do?

2060
01:05:43,011 --> 01:05:44,039
It's okay.

2061
01:05:44,040 --> 01:05:46,039
(I should keep the promise.)

2062
01:05:46,040 --> 01:05:47,110
What's this?

2063
01:05:47,111 --> 01:05:48,304
(However...)

2064
01:05:49,150 --> 01:05:50,950
(He uses the side of his hand.)

2065
01:05:50,951 --> 01:05:52,959
Didn't you learn how to fight?

2066
01:05:53,080 --> 01:05:54,346
How can you hit me with that?

2067
01:05:55,790 --> 01:05:57,820
(It appears in martial arts films.)

2068
01:05:57,821 --> 01:06:00,660
(It's a death blow with the side of the hand.)

2069
01:06:00,661 --> 01:06:01,853
How can you hit me with that?

2070
01:06:02,190 --> 01:06:03,415
(Thud)

2071
01:06:04,131 --> 01:06:05,527
I hit the wrong spot.

2072
01:06:06,531 --> 01:06:07,999
(It sounds quieter than before.)

2073
01:06:08,000 --> 01:06:09,169
Look.

2074
01:06:09,170 --> 01:06:10,630
- It hit here. - No, Dong Hwi.

2075
01:06:10,631 --> 01:06:12,129
- It's red. - I hit the wrong spot.

2076
01:06:12,440 --> 01:06:14,039
It didn't look like it'd hurt,

2077
01:06:14,040 --> 01:06:15,470
but it's really painful. It wasn't fun either.

2078
01:06:15,471 --> 01:06:16,532
I hit the wrong spot.

2079
01:06:17,741 --> 01:06:19,280
(After playing two rounds, they arrive at the peak.)

2080
01:06:19,281 --> 01:06:20,331
You look good with it.

2081
01:06:20,940 --> 01:06:22,073
You look good with it.

2082
01:06:22,551 --> 01:06:24,009
Take a seat. Can you get on it?

2083
01:06:24,381 --> 01:06:25,911
Try it first.

2084
01:06:25,980 --> 01:06:28,220
(He struggles to bend his body to fit.)

2085
01:06:28,221 --> 01:06:29,414
You look very comfortable.

2086
01:06:30,491 --> 01:06:32,123
- Does it move forward? - Wait.

2087
01:06:32,690 --> 01:06:34,829
(Looks unstable.)

2088
01:06:34,830 --> 01:06:35,882
Can you move?

2089
01:06:35,991 --> 01:06:37,286
Can you move forward?

2090
01:06:37,891 --> 01:06:39,230
He's moving.

2091
01:06:39,231 --> 01:06:40,729
It works.

2092
01:06:42,271 --> 01:06:45,432
(It does move forward, but it looks unstable.)

2093
01:06:45,670 --> 01:06:46,690
It works.

2094
01:06:47,101 --> 01:06:48,263
It's very unstable.

2095
01:06:48,710 --> 01:06:49,770
How can it be so fast?

2096
01:06:49,771 --> 01:06:52,239
(Will he be able to pop balloons on it?)

2097
01:06:52,240 --> 01:06:55,923
(Current status)

2098
01:06:56,410 --> 01:06:57,449
(They obtain items of different sizes.)

2099
01:06:57,450 --> 01:06:58,949
What are these bikes for? Which ones are ours?

2100
01:06:58,950 --> 01:07:00,050
I can see the balloons.

2101
01:07:00,051 --> 01:07:01,249
There are small bicycles too.

2102
01:07:01,250 --> 01:07:02,311
Goodness.

2103
01:07:02,691 --> 01:07:03,843
Gosh.

2104
01:07:03,990 --> 01:07:05,989
Ours are big bicycles with small balloons.

2105
01:07:05,990 --> 01:07:07,082
Are ours big?

2106
01:07:07,261 --> 01:07:09,128
- Did you not work hard? - Listen.

2107
01:07:09,231 --> 01:07:11,302
That wasn't possible because the game was random.

2108
01:07:11,431 --> 01:07:13,100
Ours are the best bicycles.

2109
01:07:13,101 --> 01:07:15,038
We have big bicycles with small balloons.

2110
01:07:15,931 --> 01:07:16,999
All of us won the games.

2111
01:07:17,000 --> 01:07:17,999
Everyone.

2112
01:07:18,000 --> 01:07:21,000
The game consists of the first and second half.

2113
01:07:21,271 --> 01:07:23,739
Two members from each team will play.

2114
01:07:23,740 --> 01:07:25,140
- Okay. - Is that so?

2115
01:07:25,141 --> 01:07:27,579
- Good. - Every time you pop a balloon...

2116
01:07:27,580 --> 01:07:28,937
of another team,

2117
01:07:28,981 --> 01:07:30,612
you obtain one syllable.

2118
01:07:30,681 --> 01:07:33,680
The team that completes the members' name tags the fastest wins.

2119
01:07:33,681 --> 01:07:35,078
All we have to do is pop one balloon.

2120
01:07:36,221 --> 01:07:39,322
(1 syllable, 8 syllables, and 7 syllables remain)

2121
01:07:39,790 --> 01:07:42,207
- Let's go. - Let's go, Jae Seok and Dong Hwi.

2122
01:07:42,231 --> 01:07:44,372
- All we need is just one ballon. - Just one.

2123
01:07:44,790 --> 01:07:46,055
- Just one. - Just one.

2124
01:07:46,830 --> 01:07:47,959
Make sure you hold out during the first half.

2125
01:07:47,960 --> 01:07:50,551
If you pop your own balloon by mistake,

2126
01:07:50,601 --> 01:07:52,742
- you give up one syllable. - Nice.

2127
01:07:53,271 --> 01:07:54,769
Be careful, Dong Hwi.

2128
01:07:54,801 --> 01:07:55,964
Get ready.

2129
01:07:56,170 --> 01:07:57,510
Start.

2130
01:07:57,511 --> 01:07:58,938
(The first half of the game starts.)

2131
01:07:59,210 --> 01:08:00,607
It's hard to move it forward.

2132
01:08:03,051 --> 01:08:04,350
(When he sees Seok Jin who can't move forward...)

2133
01:08:04,351 --> 01:08:06,524
Dong Hwi, pop a balloon.

2134
01:08:07,051 --> 01:08:08,244
Everyone is after me.

2135
01:08:08,250 --> 01:08:10,189
(He's picked as a target.)

2136
01:08:10,920 --> 01:08:12,520
Let's go to the center.

2137
01:08:12,521 --> 01:08:13,890
(He heads towards Seok Jin.)

2138
01:08:13,891 --> 01:08:15,563
(Then he makes a quick turn.)

2139
01:08:16,261 --> 01:08:17,560
(Ji Hyo doesn't pay attention to her balloons)

2140
01:08:17,561 --> 01:08:19,906
(Jae Seok tries to pop hers.)

2141
01:08:20,801 --> 01:08:22,637
(Unfortunately, he fails.)

2142
01:08:23,070 --> 01:08:24,100
This is scary.

2143
01:08:24,101 --> 01:08:25,499
(Ji Hyo tries with all her might to run away.)

2144
01:08:25,500 --> 01:08:27,169
Go after her.

2145
01:08:27,170 --> 01:08:28,231
Defend!

2146
01:08:28,271 --> 01:08:29,669
Vroom, vroom.

2147
01:08:29,670 --> 01:08:31,470
(Seok Jin can't move his bicycle.)

2148
01:08:31,471 --> 01:08:33,071
Stay away from me.

2149
01:08:34,710 --> 01:08:37,127
(Boom)

2150
01:08:37,750 --> 01:08:40,637
(If Haha pops Seok Jin's balloon, he obtains a syllable.)

2151
01:08:41,620 --> 01:08:43,966
(Popping)

2152
01:08:45,721 --> 01:08:46,989
(Seok Jin pops his own balloon.)

2153
01:08:46,990 --> 01:08:48,459
He popped his own.

2154
01:08:48,460 --> 01:08:49,829
What have I done? It only touched the balloon gently.

2155
01:08:49,830 --> 01:08:51,870
(He turns in a syllable as he popped his own.)

2156
01:08:52,231 --> 01:08:54,169
(I'll definitely protect my last balloon.)

2157
01:08:55,000 --> 01:08:57,550
(Try to protect it if you can.)

2158
01:08:59,601 --> 01:09:02,160
(He pops two balloons of Seok Jin.)

2159
01:09:03,641 --> 01:09:05,640
(As Haha pops Seok Jin's balloons,)

2160
01:09:05,641 --> 01:09:08,088
(Haha obtains 2 out of 7 syllables.)

2161
01:09:08,511 --> 01:09:09,704
- Hey. - Look.

2162
01:09:09,811 --> 01:09:11,208
Are we eliminated if all the balloons are popped?

2163
01:09:11,981 --> 01:09:14,449
This doesn't move.

2164
01:09:14,450 --> 01:09:16,286
The bicycle doesn't move.

2165
01:09:16,790 --> 01:09:17,789
Ji Hyo.

2166
01:09:17,790 --> 01:09:19,419
Go after her.

2167
01:09:19,420 --> 01:09:20,440
Defend yourself.

2168
01:09:20,561 --> 01:09:22,159
- Go after her. - She's fast.

2169
01:09:22,160 --> 01:09:24,027
- Ji Hyo is fast. - You're fast, Ji Hyo.

2170
01:09:24,160 --> 01:09:27,700
Make an attack.

2171
01:09:28,231 --> 01:09:29,352
Attack.

2172
01:09:29,670 --> 01:09:30,721
Make an attack.

2173
01:09:31,000 --> 01:09:32,069
No.

2174
01:09:32,070 --> 01:09:33,876
(It finally pops.)

2175
01:09:34,000 --> 01:09:35,039
Nice.

2176
01:09:35,040 --> 01:09:36,470
(As Jae Seok pops Ji Hyo's balloon,)

2177
01:09:36,471 --> 01:09:37,838
(Team This One obtains one syllable.)

2178
01:09:38,441 --> 01:09:39,739
(Ji Hyo tries to run away.)

2179
01:09:39,740 --> 01:09:40,904
Run away, Ji Hyo.

2180
01:09:41,080 --> 01:09:42,079
Ji Hyo.

2181
01:09:42,080 --> 01:09:43,131
(Dong Hwi blocks her.)

2182
01:09:43,710 --> 01:09:45,020
(Jae Seok chases after her.)

2183
01:09:45,021 --> 01:09:46,619
(He smashes her balloons.)

2184
01:09:46,620 --> 01:09:48,793
(Jae Seok pops Ji Hyo's.)

2185
01:09:49,750 --> 01:09:51,890
(Team This One obtains 2 out of 8 syllables.)

2186
01:09:51,891 --> 01:09:54,001
(Ji Hyo pops Dong Hwi's balloon.)

2187
01:09:55,160 --> 01:09:59,459
Be careful behind you. Jae Seok, on your left.

2188
01:09:59,460 --> 01:10:02,021
(Peekaboo)

2189
01:10:02,530 --> 01:10:05,140
(I've been working out my thighs for this moment.)

2190
01:10:05,141 --> 01:10:07,340
(He boosts energy into his muscles and charges forward.)

2191
01:10:07,341 --> 01:10:09,483
(Popping)

2192
01:10:10,040 --> 01:10:12,440
(He pops balloons of Jae Seok and Dong Hwi one by one.)

2193
01:10:12,441 --> 01:10:13,562
Hold on. This doesn't work anymore.

2194
01:10:14,580 --> 01:10:17,743
(Jae Seok pops Ji Hyo's balloon.)

2195
01:10:17,881 --> 01:10:20,400
(Jong Kook pops Dong Hwi's balloon.)

2196
01:10:20,580 --> 01:10:21,917
All my balloons are popped.

2197
01:10:23,051 --> 01:10:24,519
(Dong Hwi is out.)

2198
01:10:25,261 --> 01:10:26,789
(Now Jae Seok from Team This One...)

2199
01:10:26,790 --> 01:10:28,190
(and Jong Kook and Haha from Team Child remain.)

2200
01:10:28,191 --> 01:10:29,660
Jae Seok, it's a fight of stamina.

2201
01:10:29,790 --> 01:10:31,800
- We don't know yet. - Turn.

2202
01:10:32,160 --> 01:10:34,506
I can't hit both right and left.

2203
01:10:34,660 --> 01:10:35,997
You go right. I'll go left.

2204
01:10:36,431 --> 01:10:38,235
Corner him. We can do it.

2205
01:10:38,941 --> 01:10:41,569
Run away, Jae Seok. Behind you.

2206
01:10:41,570 --> 01:10:44,325
Behind you, Jae Seok. Jong Kook is behind you.

2207
01:10:44,370 --> 01:10:45,503
- Dodge him. - He'll be caught.

2208
01:10:45,610 --> 01:10:47,988
- Jong Kook is so fast. - He's so fast.

2209
01:10:48,110 --> 01:10:49,409
At this rate...

2210
01:10:49,410 --> 01:10:50,676
Jong Kook is so fast.

2211
01:10:52,120 --> 01:10:54,079
Jae Seok, go to your left.

2212
01:10:54,080 --> 01:10:55,619
- Turn to your left. - What's going on?

2213
01:10:55,620 --> 01:10:56,876
(Popping)

2214
01:10:57,521 --> 01:10:59,397
Jae Seok, do something.

2215
01:10:59,591 --> 01:11:01,659
The bicycle doesn't go easily.

2216
01:11:01,660 --> 01:11:03,430
I was startled by how fast Jong Kook was.

2217
01:11:03,431 --> 01:11:04,451
To your right.

2218
01:11:05,261 --> 01:11:07,097
(His last balloon pops.)

2219
01:11:07,660 --> 01:11:08,800
We got it.

2220
01:11:08,801 --> 01:11:11,585
(He obtains a total of 7 syllables.)

2221
01:11:11,870 --> 01:11:12,869
I knew it.

2222
01:11:12,870 --> 01:11:14,069
(I can't defeat that thigh engine.)

2223
01:11:14,070 --> 01:11:15,295
Each team, go to your corner.

2224
01:11:15,441 --> 01:11:16,869
What happened to us?

2225
01:11:17,271 --> 01:11:18,709
Here's the result of the first half.

2226
01:11:19,740 --> 01:11:21,609
Team This One won three syllables.

2227
01:11:21,610 --> 01:11:23,549
- I was so close. - Next is...

2228
01:11:23,750 --> 01:11:27,320
For Team This Guy, Ji Hyo popped one balloon.

2229
01:11:27,920 --> 01:11:30,368
Seok Jin popped his own.

2230
01:11:30,490 --> 01:11:32,397
1 minus 1 is 0.

2231
01:11:32,521 --> 01:11:34,255
Seok Jin might get penalized.

2232
01:11:34,261 --> 01:11:35,659
We just need one.

2233
01:11:35,660 --> 01:11:37,230
If you didn't pop yours...

2234
01:11:37,231 --> 01:11:38,455
I know.

2235
01:11:38,530 --> 01:11:39,856
It would have been good.

2236
01:11:39,931 --> 01:11:41,461
Team Child popped...

2237
01:11:41,561 --> 01:11:43,400
seven balloons.

2238
01:11:43,401 --> 01:11:45,100
- No way. - Didn't we win?

2239
01:11:45,101 --> 01:11:46,569
- It's over for us, right? - We popped seven.

2240
01:11:46,570 --> 01:11:48,669
- You did. - Yes!

2241
01:11:48,670 --> 01:11:51,010
That's amazing. How is it possible?

2242
01:11:51,011 --> 01:11:52,340
That was too easy.

2243
01:11:52,341 --> 01:11:53,609
The second half will...

2244
01:11:53,610 --> 01:11:55,109
- determine who places last. - Just pop one, Kwang Soo.

2245
01:11:55,110 --> 01:11:56,508
- Aren't we playing? - Just pop one.

2246
01:11:56,710 --> 01:11:58,279
Let's start. Are you ready?

2247
01:11:58,280 --> 01:12:00,020
- You can do it. - You can do it.

2248
01:12:00,021 --> 01:12:01,714
The game is over once we pop one balloon.

2249
01:12:01,851 --> 01:12:03,482
- Just pop one. - Then this game is over.

2250
01:12:03,620 --> 01:12:05,559
We need to pop five balloons.

2251
01:12:05,820 --> 01:12:07,045
Get ready.

2252
01:12:07,420 --> 01:12:09,090
(Who will win this round?)

2253
01:12:09,091 --> 01:12:10,213
Start.

2254
01:12:10,931 --> 01:12:12,659
(The second half starts.)

2255
01:12:12,660 --> 01:12:13,824
Just one.

2256
01:12:13,931 --> 01:12:16,012
- Go to where there's space. - Okay.

2257
01:12:16,070 --> 01:12:17,223
Kwang Soo.

2258
01:12:17,670 --> 01:12:18,894
What are you doing, Kwang Soo?

2259
01:12:19,441 --> 01:12:20,899
He can't move.

2260
01:12:21,000 --> 01:12:22,980
Kwang Soo isn't moving.

2261
01:12:23,641 --> 01:12:25,279
- Kwang Soo. - He's falling down.

2262
01:12:25,280 --> 01:12:27,075
(Falling)

2263
01:12:28,011 --> 01:12:31,315
(Today's lesson. Ride a bicycle of your body size.)

2264
01:12:32,080 --> 01:12:34,192
(This is my chance.)

2265
01:12:34,620 --> 01:12:36,323
It's now.

2266
01:12:36,920 --> 01:12:38,858
Use your feet to go forward.

2267
01:12:39,521 --> 01:12:40,745
Corner him.

2268
01:12:41,261 --> 01:12:43,128
They're coming.

2269
01:12:43,261 --> 01:12:44,720
- Seriously. - Kwang Soo.

2270
01:12:44,830 --> 01:12:46,157
(Swinging)

2271
01:12:47,101 --> 01:12:48,254
Work hard.

2272
01:12:48,801 --> 01:12:50,529
I'll pop a balloon when they arrive.

2273
01:12:50,530 --> 01:12:51,693
Do that.

2274
01:12:52,040 --> 01:12:53,060
Just pop one.

2275
01:12:53,601 --> 01:12:54,662
Hey!

2276
01:12:55,771 --> 01:12:58,340
(Running with the bicycle may be better.)

2277
01:12:58,341 --> 01:13:00,625
(They try to attack Kwang Soo who fell down.)

2278
01:13:01,011 --> 01:13:03,020
(He reacts very fast.)

2279
01:13:03,551 --> 01:13:04,680
He's safe.

2280
01:13:04,681 --> 01:13:05,819
He saved himself.

2281
01:13:05,820 --> 01:13:06,902
His balloons aren't popped.

2282
01:13:07,681 --> 01:13:08,819
Corner him.

2283
01:13:08,820 --> 01:13:11,166
- They're like hyenas. - Okay, okay.

2284
01:13:12,360 --> 01:13:13,619
They're coming. Be careful.

2285
01:13:13,620 --> 01:13:14,659
(Team This One is cornering Kwang Soo.)

2286
01:13:14,660 --> 01:13:16,293
(Popping)

2287
01:13:17,131 --> 01:13:20,230
(Jae Seok pops Kwang Soo's balloon.)

2288
01:13:20,231 --> 01:13:22,781
(Se Chan pops Seok Jin's balloon.)

2289
01:13:23,271 --> 01:13:25,999
(They obtain 2 syllables instantly.)

2290
01:13:26,000 --> 01:13:27,569
Run away.

2291
01:13:27,570 --> 01:13:28,937
- Run away for now. - Run away.

2292
01:13:29,170 --> 01:13:30,909
- It's a fight of stamina. - Let's run away.

2293
01:13:30,910 --> 01:13:32,440
(If they pop 3 more balloons, they'll win the second place.)

2294
01:13:32,740 --> 01:13:34,709
They're coming.

2295
01:13:34,710 --> 01:13:36,150
Just one.

2296
01:13:36,151 --> 01:13:37,202
Pop just one, Kwang Soo.

2297
01:13:37,811 --> 01:13:39,449
Kwang Soo's bicycle is...

2298
01:13:39,450 --> 01:13:40,449
(He wants to pop too.)

2299
01:13:40,450 --> 01:13:42,090
too short for his legs.

2300
01:13:42,091 --> 01:13:43,419
It's uncomfortable for him.

2301
01:13:43,420 --> 01:13:45,327
Pop his balloon when he falls.

2302
01:13:45,460 --> 01:13:46,489
Goodness.

2303
01:13:46,490 --> 01:13:47,619
(Struggling)

2304
01:13:47,620 --> 01:13:49,959
Just push with your feet.

2305
01:13:49,960 --> 01:13:51,114
(Even people watching him feel nervous.)

2306
01:13:52,101 --> 01:13:55,017
(Breaking)

2307
01:13:55,101 --> 01:13:56,499
Hey, Kwang Soo.

2308
01:13:56,500 --> 01:13:59,398
(His bicycle couldn't resist his weight.)

2309
01:14:00,370 --> 01:14:03,940
(He charges towards fallen Kwang Soo.)

2310
01:14:04,610 --> 01:14:05,739
Wait.

2311
01:14:05,740 --> 01:14:07,169
(It's their golden opportunity to pop balloons.)

2312
01:14:08,110 --> 01:14:10,732
(Se Chan pops Kwang Soo's balloon.)

2313
01:14:11,280 --> 01:14:13,698
(Team This One has to pop only two more.)

2314
01:14:13,881 --> 01:14:16,989
(It's a dangerous moment for Kwang Soo.)

2315
01:14:16,990 --> 01:14:19,877
(Kwang Soo is in bigger trouble.)

2316
01:14:22,830 --> 01:14:25,159
(It could be very dangerous to ride a bicycle of wrong size.)

2317
01:14:25,160 --> 01:14:27,630
Why do things like that always happen to him?

2318
01:14:27,631 --> 01:14:29,230
- What's wrong with you? - Now is the chance.

2319
01:14:29,231 --> 01:14:31,430
(He forgets his terrible pain.)

2320
01:14:31,431 --> 01:14:35,389
(He struggles to protect his balloons.)

2321
01:14:35,740 --> 01:14:37,239
(He obtains a unicycle by surprise.)

2322
01:14:37,240 --> 01:14:38,470
It's a unicycle.

2323
01:14:38,471 --> 01:14:40,684
He has a unicycle.

2324
01:14:41,040 --> 01:14:42,478
It's a unicycle.

2325
01:14:43,080 --> 01:14:44,680
No, Kwang Soo.

2326
01:14:44,681 --> 01:14:45,949
(Team This One attempts to make a series of attacks.)

2327
01:14:45,950 --> 01:14:48,950
(Jae Seok successfully pops Seok Jin's balloon.)

2328
01:14:49,320 --> 01:14:50,489
Hold out, Seok Jin.

2329
01:14:50,490 --> 01:14:52,092
- What are you doing? - It's over if one of ours pops.

2330
01:14:52,320 --> 01:14:53,560
It's over if one of ours pops.

2331
01:14:53,561 --> 01:14:54,682
Gather.

2332
01:14:54,721 --> 01:14:56,690
They'll be so disappointed if they lose now.

2333
01:14:56,691 --> 01:14:57,782
How many are left?

2334
01:14:58,091 --> 01:15:00,800
They're being careful because they never know.

2335
01:15:00,801 --> 01:15:02,230
They have to pop 1, and we also have to pop 1.

2336
01:15:02,231 --> 01:15:03,352
They have to pop one.

2337
01:15:03,870 --> 01:15:05,400
- It's a fight of one. - It is.

2338
01:15:05,601 --> 01:15:07,069
Turn, Jae Seok.

2339
01:15:07,341 --> 01:15:09,340
(Jae Seok and Se Chan put pressure on the opposing team.)

2340
01:15:09,341 --> 01:15:10,510
Here we go.

2341
01:15:10,511 --> 01:15:11,868
(Jae Seok and Se Chan put pressure on Kwang Soo and Seok Jin.)

2342
01:15:12,641 --> 01:15:13,702
Be careful.

2343
01:15:13,941 --> 01:15:15,379
We need to defend ourselves.

2344
01:15:15,450 --> 01:15:17,899
Come. Put the balloons in between us.

2345
01:15:18,110 --> 01:15:19,150
Come here.

2346
01:15:19,151 --> 01:15:20,885
- I'll come to you. - Come here.

2347
01:15:21,450 --> 01:15:22,643
Seok Jin!

2348
01:15:23,051 --> 01:15:24,890
(Will the game end like this?)

2349
01:15:24,891 --> 01:15:26,560
(Swinging)

2350
01:15:26,561 --> 01:15:27,890
Seok Jin!

2351
01:15:27,891 --> 01:15:30,788
(He defends himself at an incredible speed.)

2352
01:15:31,530 --> 01:15:33,499
Stay alert, Seok Jin.

2353
01:15:33,500 --> 01:15:35,296
- That was really quick. - That was amazing.

2354
01:15:35,500 --> 01:15:36,520
Turn that way.

2355
01:15:36,601 --> 01:15:37,869
Hang in there. It's a fight of stamina.

2356
01:15:37,870 --> 01:15:39,300
(A good match is taking place.)

2357
01:15:39,301 --> 01:15:40,440
I'll protect you.

2358
01:15:40,441 --> 01:15:44,826
(Jae Seok and Se Chan target Kwang Soo.)

2359
01:15:47,311 --> 01:15:49,218
There's not much Kwang Soo can do.

2360
01:15:50,651 --> 01:15:53,650
(While only defending himself, Kwang Soo makes a choice.)

2361
01:15:53,651 --> 01:15:56,319
(He throws his toy hammer to attack them.)

2362
01:15:56,320 --> 01:15:57,473
Kwang Soo has no toy hammer.

2363
01:15:57,750 --> 01:15:58,789
Goodness.

2364
01:15:58,790 --> 01:16:00,060
(He has lost his toy hammer and his bicycle.)

2365
01:16:00,061 --> 01:16:01,260
What are you doing?

2366
01:16:01,261 --> 01:16:03,390
(His toy hammer is too far.)

2367
01:16:03,391 --> 01:16:04,989
It fell right in front of him.

2368
01:16:04,990 --> 01:16:06,489
I'll get it for you.

2369
01:16:07,731 --> 01:16:09,270
Be careful.

2370
01:16:09,271 --> 01:16:10,900
(He takes a risk to get the hammer.)

2371
01:16:10,901 --> 01:16:12,676
(He takes his chance.)

2372
01:16:13,601 --> 01:16:15,579
(He attacks unarmed Kwang Soo.)

2373
01:16:15,971 --> 01:16:17,061
No! My toy hammer!

2374
01:16:17,370 --> 01:16:18,707
I got it.

2375
01:16:19,580 --> 01:16:20,703
No! My toy hammer!

2376
01:16:20,981 --> 01:16:22,150
(Se Chan has lost his toy hammer.)

2377
01:16:22,151 --> 01:16:23,579
I got it.

2378
01:16:23,710 --> 01:16:25,414
- Hey, hey. - I got it.

2379
01:16:26,420 --> 01:16:27,676
Pick it up.

2380
01:16:28,450 --> 01:16:29,675
- No. - He got it.

2381
01:16:30,120 --> 01:16:31,690
Here I go.

2382
01:16:31,691 --> 01:16:33,289
- I can't go forward. - Protect your balloons.

2383
01:16:33,290 --> 01:16:34,459
We have a big one.

2384
01:16:34,460 --> 01:16:35,630
- Give that to me. - It's a big one.

2385
01:16:35,631 --> 01:16:37,058
Give that to me.

2386
01:16:37,231 --> 01:16:38,390
Kwang Soo, give that to me.

2387
01:16:38,391 --> 01:16:39,452
Okay.

2388
01:16:40,000 --> 01:16:41,430
- We're in trouble. - Come here.

2389
01:16:41,431 --> 01:16:42,499
(We don't know who will win.)

2390
01:16:42,500 --> 01:16:44,270
This is so much fun.

2391
01:16:44,271 --> 01:16:46,100
It makes me want to watch.

2392
01:16:46,101 --> 01:16:47,440
It's interesting.

2393
01:16:47,441 --> 01:16:48,709
It's interesting.

2394
01:16:48,710 --> 01:16:50,440
- We never know. - We really don't.

2395
01:16:50,441 --> 01:16:51,971
Go and pop their balloons.

2396
01:16:52,941 --> 01:16:54,209
What do you think?

2397
01:16:54,210 --> 01:16:55,884
Let's just charge forward.

2398
01:16:55,910 --> 01:16:57,543
- Let's throw ourselves into it. - For the last time?

2399
01:16:59,920 --> 01:17:01,449
We just need to pop one.

2400
01:17:01,450 --> 01:17:02,550
Just one.

2401
01:17:02,551 --> 01:17:04,865
(Both teams plan to attack. Who will be the winner?)

2402
01:17:05,660 --> 01:17:06,690
(Both teams are careful about their attack.)

2403
01:17:06,691 --> 01:17:07,959
Just go for one.

2404
01:17:07,960 --> 01:17:08,959
(Both teams are careful about their attack.)

2405
01:17:08,960 --> 01:17:10,051
Get ready.

2406
01:17:10,191 --> 01:17:11,762
They're coming.

2407
01:17:12,561 --> 01:17:16,100
(It's like the calm before a storm.)

2408
01:17:16,101 --> 01:17:17,130
They're coming.

2409
01:17:17,131 --> 01:17:18,130
(They aim for one.)

2410
01:17:18,131 --> 01:17:19,800
We can pop it when they arrive.

2411
01:17:19,801 --> 01:17:20,940
Let's attack when they come.

2412
01:17:20,941 --> 01:17:22,869
(Neither of them can attack hastily.)

2413
01:17:22,870 --> 01:17:24,770
(Just then)

2414
01:17:24,771 --> 01:17:26,779
(Kwang Soo moves forward little by little.)

2415
01:17:26,780 --> 01:17:28,539
Your balloon.

2416
01:17:28,540 --> 01:17:29,650
(However)

2417
01:17:29,651 --> 01:17:31,955
(His balloon falls off.)

2418
01:17:32,120 --> 01:17:34,629
(His balloon isn't protected.)

2419
01:17:35,691 --> 01:17:38,608
(Se Chan goes toward the balloon.)

2420
01:17:38,891 --> 01:17:40,159
(Protect your balloon, Kwang Soo.)

2421
01:17:40,160 --> 01:17:41,760
My balloon is here.

2422
01:17:41,761 --> 01:17:43,829
(Will Se Chan pop the balloon and end the game?)

2423
01:17:43,830 --> 01:17:47,166
(Or will Seok Jin protect the balloon and continue the game?)

2424
01:17:48,870 --> 01:17:49,869
- Okay. - No!

2425
01:17:49,870 --> 01:17:50,900
(Popping)

2426
01:17:50,901 --> 01:17:52,140
My balloon is here.

2427
01:17:52,141 --> 01:17:54,999
(Se Chan hits it accurately and pops the balloon.)

2428
01:17:55,000 --> 01:17:56,239
Goodness.

2429
01:17:56,240 --> 01:17:59,444
(The fate of two teams is swapped due to Kwang Soo's mistake.)

2430
01:18:00,011 --> 01:18:02,051
(Popping)

2431
01:18:02,910 --> 01:18:05,749
(We'd have won if we had popped one.)

2432
01:18:05,750 --> 01:18:08,020
This is insane.

2433
01:18:08,021 --> 01:18:09,690
(Team Seok Jin in third, Team Jae Seok in second,)

2434
01:18:09,691 --> 01:18:10,711
(Team Haha in first)

2435
01:18:10,891 --> 01:18:13,819
The winning team today is...

2436
01:18:13,820 --> 01:18:15,159
- Could it be? - Team Haha.

2437
01:18:15,160 --> 01:18:17,730
(Team Child is today's winner.)

2438
01:18:17,731 --> 01:18:18,829
That's amazing.

2439
01:18:18,830 --> 01:18:20,260
Second place isn't bad.

2440
01:18:20,261 --> 01:18:21,859
- It isn't bad. - Second place isn't bad.

2441
01:18:21,860 --> 01:18:24,369
We thought we'd face the penalty.

2442
01:18:24,370 --> 01:18:25,870
We only had to pop one.

2443
01:18:26,700 --> 01:18:28,333
We'd have won if we had popped one.

2444
01:18:28,641 --> 01:18:29,840
Wait.

2445
01:18:29,841 --> 01:18:30,970
He's thinking.

2446
01:18:30,971 --> 01:18:32,061
Wait.

2447
01:18:32,141 --> 01:18:33,340
- We bought "Seok". - We have "Seok".

2448
01:18:33,341 --> 01:18:34,880
"Seok" also includes me.

2449
01:18:34,881 --> 01:18:36,180
He bought "Seok".

2450
01:18:36,181 --> 01:18:37,609
- I bought it. - Me too.

2451
01:18:37,610 --> 01:18:40,150
The only person whose name isn't complete is...

2452
01:18:40,151 --> 01:18:41,548
Seok Jin.

2453
01:18:41,820 --> 01:18:44,419
Did Seok Jin pop your balloon, didn't you?

2454
01:18:44,420 --> 01:18:46,257
Yes, it's because I was very angry.

2455
01:18:47,320 --> 01:18:48,359
Goodness.

2456
01:18:48,360 --> 01:18:51,216
(Seok Jin popped a balloon.)

2457
01:18:51,431 --> 01:18:52,959
- That's right. - Why did you pop it?

2458
01:18:52,960 --> 01:18:54,159
Why did you pop it?

2459
01:18:54,160 --> 01:18:55,803
I was too angry.

2460
01:18:56,301 --> 01:18:57,369
- Seriously. - Seok Jin.

2461
01:18:57,370 --> 01:18:59,482
- You could have won your name. - I was so upset.

2462
01:18:59,801 --> 01:19:01,331
I see.

2463
01:19:01,441 --> 01:19:03,739
- There was no penalty today. - There was no penalty.

2464
01:19:03,740 --> 01:19:05,647
- Right. - There was no penalty.

2465
01:19:05,841 --> 01:19:07,310
Why did you make it worse?

2466
01:19:07,311 --> 01:19:08,609
(It's the butterfly effect of the balloon that he popped.)

2467
01:19:08,610 --> 01:19:10,050
Do we have to take one out?

2468
01:19:10,051 --> 01:19:11,540
You have to take out one syllable.

2469
01:19:11,681 --> 01:19:12,980
Wait.

2470
01:19:12,981 --> 01:19:15,489
- If I lose 1, shouldn't he lose 1? - Right.

2471
01:19:15,490 --> 01:19:17,050
If you take out "Seok", both will be penalized.

2472
01:19:17,051 --> 01:19:18,650
(Both Seok Jin and Jae Seok will face the penalty.)

2473
01:19:18,651 --> 01:19:19,659
That's right.

2474
01:19:19,660 --> 01:19:20,859
(Both Seok Jin and Jae Seok will face the penalty.)

2475
01:19:20,860 --> 01:19:21,890
What?

2476
01:19:21,891 --> 01:19:22,890
(I worked so hard to get my name back.)

2477
01:19:22,891 --> 01:19:25,029
- That's right. - What are you talking about?

2478
01:19:25,030 --> 01:19:26,930
- What about "Lee"? - Lee from Lee Kwang Soo.

2479
01:19:26,931 --> 01:19:28,735
Kwang Soo's last name is Lee.

2480
01:19:29,231 --> 01:19:31,100
- Play rock-paper-scissors. - I didn't know.

2481
01:19:31,101 --> 01:19:32,569
Does the winner of rock-paper-scissors...

2482
01:19:32,870 --> 01:19:34,900
decide which syllable to take out?

2483
01:19:34,901 --> 01:19:36,810
Yes, the winner decides.

2484
01:19:36,811 --> 01:19:37,810
That's right.

2485
01:19:37,811 --> 01:19:39,440
- Play rock-paper-scissors. - Will it be a beautiful end?

2486
01:19:39,441 --> 01:19:41,042
- Play. - Rock-paper-scissors.

2487
01:19:41,240 --> 01:19:42,949
(Kwang Soo wins.)

2488
01:19:42,950 --> 01:19:44,512
Yes!

2489
01:19:45,311 --> 01:19:46,520
"Seok".

2490
01:19:46,521 --> 01:19:48,621
(He doesn't hesitate a second.)

2491
01:19:48,820 --> 01:19:49,919
We'll take out "Seok".

2492
01:19:49,920 --> 01:19:50,919
"Seok".

2493
01:19:50,920 --> 01:19:52,348
We'll take out "Seok".

2494
01:19:52,660 --> 01:19:54,089
- Come on. - I took out "Seok".

2495
01:19:54,460 --> 01:19:56,531
- No. - Think about it again.

2496
01:19:57,030 --> 01:19:58,356
Come here.

2497
01:19:58,490 --> 01:19:59,760
- Okay. - Thank you.

2498
01:19:59,761 --> 01:20:01,659
- You just wait and see. - I won't forget this.

2499
01:20:01,660 --> 01:20:03,976
(This One and This Guy will face the penalty.)

2500
01:20:04,000 --> 01:20:05,640
Their names together are "This One, This Guy".

2501
01:20:05,641 --> 01:20:06,770
- This One, This Guy. - This One, This Guy.

2502
01:20:06,771 --> 01:20:07,791
This One, This Guy.

2503
01:20:07,971 --> 01:20:09,010
Get ready.

2504
01:20:09,011 --> 01:20:11,417
- Okay. - 1, 2, 3.

2505
01:20:11,710 --> 01:20:14,057
(Splashing)

2506
01:20:14,841 --> 01:20:16,079
That was a good throw.

2507
01:20:16,080 --> 01:20:17,079
(You wait and see.)

2508
01:20:17,080 --> 01:20:18,380
That was love.

2509
01:20:18,381 --> 01:20:20,359
- Right? - 1, 2, 3.

2510
01:20:22,990 --> 01:20:24,582
(Splashing)

2511
01:20:25,351 --> 01:20:27,520
(When will it come?)

2512
01:20:27,521 --> 01:20:29,835
(Now)

2513
01:20:30,360 --> 01:20:32,879
(We thank Lee Dong Hwi for being with us today.)

2514
01:20:34,101 --> 01:20:35,487
It felt refreshing.

2515
01:20:37,601 --> 01:20:42,028
(They finish the race where they went back to being children.)

2516
01:20:42,141 --> 01:20:45,334
(There is secret history that isn't in the records.)

2517
01:20:46,410 --> 01:20:49,542
(Historical pieces are given to 8 members)

2518
01:20:50,181 --> 01:20:52,731
(All hints point to 1 person)

2519
01:20:52,981 --> 01:20:55,295
(Sejong the Great)

2520
01:20:55,450 --> 01:20:57,867
(Find sealed heritage secretly left by Sejong the Great.)

2521
01:20:58,091 --> 01:21:00,977
(They start to search the treasure.)

2522
01:21:01,591 --> 01:21:04,630
(It's an intense psychological war among 8 members.)

2523
01:21:04,631 --> 01:21:07,721
(All hints point to one mysterious place.)

2524
01:21:08,000 --> 01:21:10,010
(That place is...)

2525
01:21:10,731 --> 01:21:13,454
(a huge, unidentifiable basement where treasures are hidden.)

2526
01:21:13,601 --> 01:21:16,609
(The worst penalty awaits those who don't pass the test.)

2527
01:21:16,610 --> 01:21:19,480
(The owner of the treasures starts to get revealed.)

2528
01:21:19,481 --> 01:21:21,990
(Who will win the sealed heritage?)

2529
01:21:22,280 --> 01:21:25,106
(Deep-rooted Secret)
