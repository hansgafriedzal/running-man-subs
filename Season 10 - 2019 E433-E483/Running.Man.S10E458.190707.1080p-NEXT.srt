1
00:00:05,689 --> 00:00:06,988
It's summer now.

2
00:00:06,989 --> 00:00:08,488
- Hello. - Hi.

3
00:00:08,489 --> 00:00:09,517
Hello.

4
00:00:09,518 --> 00:00:11,881
Looking at the set-up here today,

5
00:00:11,889 --> 00:00:14,586
- I noticed we have a keyboard here. - Right.

6
00:00:14,899 --> 00:00:16,427
- I already know what this is for. - What's all this?

7
00:00:16,428 --> 00:00:17,967
- Finally. - And we're on the lawn too.

8
00:00:17,968 --> 00:00:19,497
- We've been waiting for this. - It's the joint performance.

9
00:00:19,498 --> 00:00:20,598
- It's time! - This is nice.

10
00:00:20,599 --> 00:00:22,467
- I'm so excited. - My gosh.

11
00:00:22,468 --> 00:00:23,967
- I'm so nervous. - This is going to be fun.

12
00:00:23,968 --> 00:00:24,967
Nice.

13
00:00:24,968 --> 00:00:26,267
- We have so many sitting cushions. - Seriously, I'm so excited.

14
00:00:26,268 --> 00:00:27,508
- There are a lot. - How many artists are there?

15
00:00:27,509 --> 00:00:29,307
- We have a lot. - There are a lot of seats.

16
00:00:29,308 --> 00:00:31,328
Will I be able to see them in person?

17
00:00:32,148 --> 00:00:33,408
By the way, this is nice.

18
00:00:33,409 --> 00:00:34,692
- It's Pandora's box. - It's fancy.

19
00:00:35,948 --> 00:00:37,017
Se Chan, seriously.

20
00:00:37,018 --> 00:00:38,618
- Your outfit looks so lame. - What?

21
00:00:38,619 --> 00:00:40,317
(We're having guests today, and you look so lame.)

22
00:00:40,318 --> 00:00:42,358
Should I buy you a belt?

23
00:00:42,359 --> 00:00:43,417
I dressed up to the nines.

24
00:00:43,418 --> 00:00:45,057
- He has a string around him. - What's that?

25
00:00:45,058 --> 00:00:47,498
- Should I tie it for you? - Why would you do that for me?

26
00:00:47,499 --> 00:00:49,398
Hey, are you two here to film a historical drama?

27
00:00:49,399 --> 00:00:51,247
(Hey, are you two here to film a historical drama?)

28
00:00:51,369 --> 00:00:54,368
Me? Don't clump me with him. My outfit looks fine.

29
00:00:54,369 --> 00:00:55,938
- He dressed like a womanizer. - Like a womanizer.

30
00:00:55,939 --> 00:00:57,038
- No, that's not me. - He's a womanizer.

31
00:00:57,039 --> 00:00:58,337
- A womanizer. - You look like a womanizer.

32
00:00:58,338 --> 00:01:00,877
- He's the good-looking one. - Right.

33
00:01:00,878 --> 00:01:02,137
(The Good-Looking Womanizer)

34
00:01:02,138 --> 00:01:04,248
- He's the good-looking one. - Right. He's the good-looking one.

35
00:01:04,249 --> 00:01:05,507
- That's your role. - He's the good-looking one?

36
00:01:05,508 --> 00:01:07,477
- And you're the smooth talker. - Smooth talker.

37
00:01:07,478 --> 00:01:10,688
You'll choose your artists through the Teamwork Race today.

38
00:01:10,689 --> 00:01:12,147
- Yes. - Teamwork Race?

39
00:01:12,148 --> 00:01:14,714
Four teams of musicians are waiting now.

40
00:01:14,889 --> 00:01:16,987
Two Running Man's members will pair up with a team of musicians...

41
00:01:16,988 --> 00:01:18,575
and perform together on stage.

42
00:01:18,889 --> 00:01:20,487
I want to sing a ballad song this time.

43
00:01:20,488 --> 00:01:21,627
- Me too. - A very soulful one.

44
00:01:21,628 --> 00:01:22,897
- Can you pull it off? - Yes.

45
00:01:22,898 --> 00:01:24,313
- I'll sing like Green Area. - I want a female singer.

46
00:01:24,368 --> 00:01:25,567
Green Area?

47
00:01:25,568 --> 00:01:28,668
- Jong Kook... - I want a soulful ballad song too.

48
00:01:28,669 --> 00:01:29,668
(He's a real ballad singer.)

49
00:01:29,669 --> 00:01:30,921
Do you want to pair up with me?

50
00:01:31,109 --> 00:01:32,468
- No, no. - That's boring.

51
00:01:32,469 --> 00:01:34,507
- Not with you. - That will be boring.

52
00:01:34,508 --> 00:01:37,578
Wasn't that really disappointing? He said, "not with you".

53
00:01:37,579 --> 00:01:39,108
- Why not? - I'd be disappointed.

54
00:01:39,109 --> 00:01:41,099
Why not, JK? You're afraid we won't stand out?

55
00:01:41,318 --> 00:01:43,843
- Double Ha. Don't be like that. - "Double Ha"?

56
00:01:43,949 --> 00:01:45,088
My gosh.

57
00:01:45,089 --> 00:01:48,688
You'll listen to a snippet of a trot song the artists will sing...

58
00:01:48,689 --> 00:01:49,888
without any instrumental music.

59
00:01:49,889 --> 00:01:50,957
- Without instrumental music? - Trot songs?

60
00:01:50,958 --> 00:01:54,534
And they will choose two members who will ask them questions.

61
00:01:54,628 --> 00:01:56,627
- They'll answer only 2 questions. - 2 questions?

62
00:01:56,628 --> 00:01:58,828
- Two questions? - Once we hear their voices,

63
00:01:58,829 --> 00:02:00,737
- we'll recognize the singers. - They have unique voices.

64
00:02:00,738 --> 00:02:01,767
- We'll know right away. - Right.

65
00:02:01,768 --> 00:02:03,968
Why don't you listen to their singing first?

66
00:02:03,969 --> 00:02:05,468
- Okay, let's listen to them first. - Trot songs?

67
00:02:05,469 --> 00:02:06,767
- We'll start with number one. - They'll sing without the music.

68
00:02:06,768 --> 00:02:07,877
I'll know once I listen to them.

69
00:02:07,878 --> 00:02:10,778
All right. The artists behind door number one.

70
00:02:10,848 --> 00:02:13,778
Please sing a trot song without the music.

71
00:02:13,779 --> 00:02:14,778
(Looking forward to it)

72
00:02:14,779 --> 00:02:15,828
Please sing.

73
00:02:17,119 --> 00:02:23,158
My goodness, my goodness, don't be like that

74
00:02:23,159 --> 00:02:24,400
It's a female singer.

75
00:02:24,788 --> 00:02:26,303
- Her voice is husky. - It's a female singer.

76
00:02:26,529 --> 00:02:27,898
Isn't that Jin Young?

77
00:02:27,899 --> 00:02:29,757
No, it's not Jin Young.

78
00:02:29,758 --> 00:02:31,928
- She has a husky voice. - Right. It's Jin Young.

79
00:02:31,929 --> 00:02:33,297
Don't laugh

80
00:02:33,298 --> 00:02:34,567
Her voice is really nice though.

81
00:02:34,568 --> 00:02:37,067
- I can tell she's a good singer. - She's trying to deceive us.

82
00:02:37,068 --> 00:02:38,567
- She's a good singer to begin with. - Her voice is really husky.

83
00:02:38,568 --> 00:02:40,567
- She was relaxed when she sang. - I can't guess who that is.

84
00:02:40,568 --> 00:02:41,977
- That was done on purpose. - Right.

85
00:02:41,978 --> 00:02:43,877
She didn't use her vocal power at all. Number one didn't.

86
00:02:43,878 --> 00:02:45,323
- That was confusing. - Right.

87
00:02:45,948 --> 00:02:47,417
- Who is she? - Her pitch was perfect.

88
00:02:47,418 --> 00:02:49,778
We'll listen to the musician behind door number two now.

89
00:02:49,779 --> 00:02:50,859
(The 2nd artist sings a trot song without any music.)

90
00:02:50,888 --> 00:02:52,000
Please sing it.

91
00:02:52,989 --> 00:02:55,857
(He sings with power.)

92
00:02:55,858 --> 00:02:58,488
My love toward you

93
00:02:58,489 --> 00:02:59,740
- Hold on, please stop. - What?

94
00:02:59,788 --> 00:03:02,498
- That singer was... - Wasn't that Myung Soo?

95
00:03:02,499 --> 00:03:03,498
- You know what? - I think he's a comedian.

96
00:03:03,499 --> 00:03:05,667
Regardless of one's singing ability,

97
00:03:05,668 --> 00:03:07,338
I can tell this person is very ambitious.

98
00:03:07,339 --> 00:03:08,783
(The 2nd artist is overly ambitious.)

99
00:03:09,098 --> 00:03:10,398
- Is it too much? - Is that so?

100
00:03:10,399 --> 00:03:11,667
- He sang powerfully. - I should talk to him.

101
00:03:11,668 --> 00:03:12,738
He wants to stand out.

102
00:03:12,739 --> 00:03:14,961
In my opinion, I think he has a hidden agenda...

103
00:03:15,108 --> 00:03:16,725
other than the joint performance.

104
00:03:16,878 --> 00:03:18,868
- I should stay far away from him. - Right.

105
00:03:18,878 --> 00:03:20,524
- Right. - We must put him in his place.

106
00:03:20,779 --> 00:03:21,929
What do you mean?

107
00:03:22,318 --> 00:03:24,268
- I must put him where he belongs? - You'll do that?

108
00:03:24,318 --> 00:03:26,287
- I ought to do that. - Hey.

109
00:03:26,288 --> 00:03:27,787
Do you even have enough power to do that?

110
00:03:27,788 --> 00:03:30,287
- I don't. - Can you even pull that off?

111
00:03:30,288 --> 00:03:32,588
- You look like a village foreman. - Right.

112
00:03:32,589 --> 00:03:34,257
- You're a village foreman. - My gosh.

113
00:03:34,258 --> 00:03:36,379
What do you think about the second artist's voice?

114
00:03:36,598 --> 00:03:38,567
I think he might be a viewer.

115
00:03:38,568 --> 00:03:39,597
- I thought... - Right.

116
00:03:39,598 --> 00:03:41,398
- I don't think he's a singer. - Right.

117
00:03:41,399 --> 00:03:43,667
- He's not a singer. - We should listen to the third one.

118
00:03:43,668 --> 00:03:45,567
- You think he's not a singer? - Here's why. When he sang...

119
00:03:45,568 --> 00:03:47,167
- He's not a professional singer. - No, I don't think he is.

120
00:03:47,168 --> 00:03:49,577
- He does sound too enthusiastic. - You think so?

121
00:03:49,578 --> 00:03:53,547
In my opinion, he could be a comedian who released an album.

122
00:03:53,749 --> 00:03:55,547
- Is that Sae Ho? - Sae Ho?

123
00:03:55,548 --> 00:03:56,648
No, no.

124
00:03:56,649 --> 00:04:00,317
I know him very well. Sae Ho can't even sing like that.

125
00:04:00,318 --> 00:04:02,944
- Right, he can't help others. - Exactly. He's not that good.

126
00:04:03,019 --> 00:04:05,381
- But he missed a few notes. - Exactly.

127
00:04:05,429 --> 00:04:08,727
- He could've done that on purpose. - That's right.

128
00:04:08,728 --> 00:04:10,327
- Think about all the possibilities. - That sounded natural.

129
00:04:10,328 --> 00:04:11,567
He might play an instrument.

130
00:04:11,568 --> 00:04:13,044
- He might not be a singer. - Right.

131
00:04:13,429 --> 00:04:14,768
It's the third artist's turn.

132
00:04:14,769 --> 00:04:18,102
(The 3rd artist will sing a trot song without music.)

133
00:04:19,009 --> 00:04:21,338
As we clink our glasses, we say,

134
00:04:21,339 --> 00:04:23,298
"Cheers, cheers, cheers"

135
00:04:23,339 --> 00:04:26,378
As we clink our glasses, we say, "cheers, cheers, cheers"

136
00:04:26,379 --> 00:04:27,578
(His singing confuses them.)

137
00:04:27,579 --> 00:04:28,818
- Is he another viewer? - Hold on.

138
00:04:28,819 --> 00:04:30,578
- Hold on. Please stop singing. - But I can't give you

139
00:04:30,579 --> 00:04:31,948
- My heart - That's enough. Thank you.

140
00:04:31,949 --> 00:04:33,148
- Here's what I think. - Wait.

141
00:04:33,149 --> 00:04:35,758
- I can't be in love - Stop! Stop singing!

142
00:04:35,759 --> 00:04:37,405
- Stop it! - That's enough.

143
00:04:37,488 --> 00:04:38,557
All alone

144
00:04:38,558 --> 00:04:39,758
- Stop singing. - Stop it.

145
00:04:39,759 --> 00:04:41,357
Is he also looking for a chance to be famous?

146
00:04:41,358 --> 00:04:42,610
- I mean... - Stop it.

147
00:04:43,029 --> 00:04:44,997
(His ambition is endless like his singing.)

148
00:04:44,998 --> 00:04:46,211
As for this guy,

149
00:04:46,329 --> 00:04:48,037
- he's very ambitious too. - He's overly motivated.

150
00:04:48,038 --> 00:04:49,886
- I'm sorry to interrupt. - Right.

151
00:04:50,139 --> 00:04:52,138
Can I ask him to sing an octave higher?

152
00:04:52,139 --> 00:04:53,237
- Do you want that? - Yes, an octave higher.

153
00:04:53,238 --> 00:04:55,602
- Excuse me, door number three. - His singing was too stable.

154
00:04:55,738 --> 00:04:57,878
- Please sing with an octave higher. - An octave higher?

155
00:04:57,879 --> 00:05:00,404
How can he sing at an octave higher?

156
00:05:01,478 --> 00:05:02,818
(He warms up his vocal cords first.)

157
00:05:02,819 --> 00:05:06,818
As we clink our glasses, we say, "cheers, cheers, cheers"

158
00:05:06,819 --> 00:05:08,787
(Perfect)

159
00:05:08,788 --> 00:05:09,888
That sounded different.

160
00:05:09,889 --> 00:05:11,057
(My gosh, he can pull that off?)

161
00:05:11,058 --> 00:05:12,300
Hey, isn't that Kim Chang Ryul?

162
00:05:12,488 --> 00:05:13,628
Isn't that Kim Chang Ryul?

163
00:05:13,629 --> 00:05:14,927
The guy from DJ DOC?

164
00:05:14,928 --> 00:05:16,040
(He sings like Kim Chang Ryul too.)

165
00:05:16,058 --> 00:05:17,210
That's enough.

166
00:05:17,498 --> 00:05:19,068
- He sounds like a singer now. - Hey, this is...

167
00:05:19,069 --> 00:05:21,237
- He's a singer. - Yes, he's a singer.

168
00:05:21,238 --> 00:05:23,338
- But he's not a ballad singer. - Right.

169
00:05:23,339 --> 00:05:24,638
- Perhaps, he sings rock. - Yes.

170
00:05:24,639 --> 00:05:26,537
We've listened to the third artist now.

171
00:05:26,538 --> 00:05:29,104
Artist behind door number four, please sing for us.

172
00:05:29,909 --> 00:05:32,977
(The 4th artist will sing a trot song without music.)

173
00:05:32,978 --> 00:05:34,161
- My gosh. - Goodness.

174
00:05:37,348 --> 00:05:39,117
(They're surprised as soon as she sings.)

175
00:05:39,118 --> 00:05:40,633
- That's Jin Young. - Wait, hold on.

176
00:05:41,019 --> 00:05:43,039
- No, it's not Jin Young's voice. - She sounds like a trot singer.

177
00:05:43,118 --> 00:05:45,007
- A senior trot singer must be here. - Hey, she's from "Miss Trot".

178
00:05:45,259 --> 00:05:46,400
She's good.

179
00:05:47,029 --> 00:05:48,357
She's really good.

180
00:05:48,358 --> 00:05:49,597
(Exceptional singing skills are evident in her voice and style.)

181
00:05:49,598 --> 00:05:50,927
- That's enough. - Isn't she...

182
00:05:50,928 --> 00:05:52,597
- Hong Ja from "Miss Trot"? - That's enough.

183
00:05:52,598 --> 00:05:54,698
- She might've been on "Miss Trot". - She's from "Miss Trot".

184
00:05:54,699 --> 00:05:56,214
- It's Hong Ja. - Was her name Ga In?

185
00:05:56,238 --> 00:05:57,367
- No, her voice is husky. - Hong Ja?

186
00:05:57,368 --> 00:05:58,367
Hong Ja has a thin voice.

187
00:05:58,368 --> 00:05:59,437
- Or it might be Mi Ae. - Hong Ja?

188
00:05:59,438 --> 00:06:01,437
No, she's a real trot singer.

189
00:06:01,438 --> 00:06:02,722
By the way, she's good.

190
00:06:03,079 --> 00:06:04,148
What did you think?

191
00:06:04,149 --> 00:06:05,708
(What does he think after listening to all of them?)

192
00:06:05,709 --> 00:06:06,977
I don't want to pair up with the second one.

193
00:06:06,978 --> 00:06:09,474
(I don't care about anything else. I just don't want the 2nd artist.)

194
00:06:09,748 --> 00:06:11,047
(That's so true.)

195
00:06:11,048 --> 00:06:12,502
- That was blunt. - The second artist...

196
00:06:12,548 --> 00:06:14,318
Does everyone not want the second artist?

197
00:06:14,319 --> 00:06:16,187
Usually, when people sing that part...

198
00:06:16,188 --> 00:06:18,128
Hold on. It's Ji Hyo's turn to talk. Wait for yours.

199
00:06:18,129 --> 00:06:20,057
(Hold on. It's Ji Hyo's turn to talk. Wait for yours.)

200
00:06:20,058 --> 00:06:21,645
- Womanizer, let's stay out of it. - Womanizer, you must wait.

201
00:06:21,699 --> 00:06:23,143
- What? Goodness. - Don't interrupt.

202
00:06:23,199 --> 00:06:24,667
- Wait, Womanizer. - I'll never wear...

203
00:06:24,668 --> 00:06:25,809
- shirts like this. - Here's why.

204
00:06:27,098 --> 00:06:28,437
- Hold on. - I didn't feel good when I wore it.

205
00:06:28,438 --> 00:06:29,838
- I'm so relieved. - Please wait for your turn.

206
00:06:29,839 --> 00:06:31,468
It's Ji Hyo's turn.

207
00:06:31,469 --> 00:06:32,953
- She's been waiting for her turn. - Yes.

208
00:06:33,009 --> 00:06:34,068
- I'm sorry. - Let her go first.

209
00:06:34,069 --> 00:06:35,138
- It's my turn. - I'm sorry.

210
00:06:35,139 --> 00:06:36,278
Ji Hyo, tell us what you think.

211
00:06:36,279 --> 00:06:38,547
He has a lilting voice.

212
00:06:38,548 --> 00:06:40,670
(He has a lilting voice.)

213
00:06:41,348 --> 00:06:43,136
I want you to listen to him before you talk.

214
00:06:43,449 --> 00:06:45,318
- Ji Hyo, focus on the show. - He didn't have a lilting voice.

215
00:06:45,319 --> 00:06:47,005
- He didn't have a lilting voice. - Right.

216
00:06:47,089 --> 00:06:48,230
What about you, Womanizer?

217
00:06:49,089 --> 00:06:50,617
- "Womanizer." - Can you answer on a motorcycle?

218
00:06:50,618 --> 00:06:52,057
If you flip the word, it becomes Weasel.

219
00:06:52,058 --> 00:06:53,271
In my opinion...

220
00:06:54,199 --> 00:06:56,421
I mean, compared to other singers,

221
00:06:56,728 --> 00:06:59,328
he tried too much to show us everything.

222
00:06:59,329 --> 00:07:00,727
- He showed off too much? - Yes.

223
00:07:00,728 --> 00:07:02,937
- What about you, So Min? - Let me make a food analogy.

224
00:07:02,938 --> 00:07:05,392
We've had bland food that wasn't seasoned well.

225
00:07:05,808 --> 00:07:07,638
- But as for the fourth singer, - That's a great analogy.

226
00:07:07,639 --> 00:07:08,838
- she was nicely seasoned. - Nicely seasoned.

227
00:07:08,839 --> 00:07:10,008
It's like grandma's cooking.

228
00:07:10,009 --> 00:07:11,247
- In a nutshell, - Grandma's cooking?

229
00:07:11,248 --> 00:07:13,547
- she's a good restaurant. - Totally.

230
00:07:13,548 --> 00:07:15,218
What about the second artist?

231
00:07:15,219 --> 00:07:17,378
In my opinion, the second artist is...

232
00:07:17,379 --> 00:07:18,588
If I were to compare it to beef radish soup...

233
00:07:18,589 --> 00:07:21,357
In my opinion, he needs advice from Mr. Baek Jong Won.

234
00:07:21,358 --> 00:07:23,378
(In my opinion, he needs advice from Mr. Baek Jong Won.)

235
00:07:24,459 --> 00:07:26,479
- He must join "Alley Restaurants". - Yes, he must join that show.

236
00:07:27,329 --> 00:07:29,097
- He must join "Alley Restaurants". - Yes, he must.

237
00:07:29,098 --> 00:07:30,258
Right. He needs Mr. Baek.

238
00:07:30,259 --> 00:07:33,935
But we could tell that 1st, 2nd, and 4th artists were...

239
00:07:33,998 --> 00:07:35,452
good at singing.

240
00:07:35,598 --> 00:07:38,638
- But the 2nd artist... - The 1st artist is a great singer.

241
00:07:38,668 --> 00:07:40,659
- Right. I see. - She didn't use her vocal cords.

242
00:07:42,079 --> 00:07:45,247
Now, we'll ask two questions to each artist.

243
00:07:45,248 --> 00:07:46,278
- Okay. - What should I ask?

244
00:07:46,279 --> 00:07:47,648
Does any of you have questions for the first artist?

245
00:07:47,649 --> 00:07:49,878
- Isn't the year of debut important? - That's important.

246
00:07:49,879 --> 00:07:51,117
- Ask that. - The year when they debuted.

247
00:07:51,118 --> 00:07:52,462
- Artist number one. - We'll know their experience.

248
00:07:53,519 --> 00:07:54,932
- Artist number one. - Yes.

249
00:07:55,019 --> 00:07:56,301
- My gosh. - Her voice is altered.

250
00:07:56,358 --> 00:07:57,518
- It's a woman. - Yes, it's a woman.

251
00:07:57,519 --> 00:07:58,871
In what year did you make your debut?

252
00:07:59,129 --> 00:08:00,487
I debuted during the 2000s.

253
00:08:00,488 --> 00:08:01,497
- The 2000s? - The 2000s?

254
00:08:01,498 --> 00:08:03,057
- Singers from the 2000s... - She's been around for a while.

255
00:08:03,058 --> 00:08:06,198
If she debuted in the early 2000s, she's been singing for 15 years.

256
00:08:06,199 --> 00:08:07,398
She won't give us a number.

257
00:08:07,399 --> 00:08:09,156
Can we ask what kind of genre she sings?

258
00:08:09,199 --> 00:08:11,290
We can ask one more question. Go ahead, Ji Hyo.

259
00:08:11,938 --> 00:08:13,908
Well, your...

260
00:08:13,909 --> 00:08:15,307
- Ask her. - Genre.

261
00:08:15,308 --> 00:08:17,338
- Well, your... Ask her. - Genre.

262
00:08:17,339 --> 00:08:18,547
You ask her about her genre.

263
00:08:18,548 --> 00:08:19,791
- She's weird. - Hold on.

264
00:08:19,879 --> 00:08:21,091
Am I your parrot?

265
00:08:21,219 --> 00:08:22,391
Womanizer, ask her.

266
00:08:22,449 --> 00:08:23,518
She called you Womanizer.

267
00:08:23,519 --> 00:08:24,600
- Ask her. - Ask her now.

268
00:08:24,788 --> 00:08:26,117
May I ask what kind of genre you sing?

269
00:08:26,118 --> 00:08:28,109
May I ask what kind of genre you sing?

270
00:08:29,019 --> 00:08:30,617
I sing various genres.

271
00:08:30,618 --> 00:08:32,388
- Various genres? - You can't answer it like that.

272
00:08:32,389 --> 00:08:33,888
- That's ambiguous. - Pick one.

273
00:08:33,889 --> 00:08:35,398
- The most confident genre. - The one you sing more frequently.

274
00:08:35,399 --> 00:08:36,974
- The genre you focus on. - Right.

275
00:08:38,928 --> 00:08:40,483
Well, RnB and ballads?

276
00:08:40,529 --> 00:08:42,498
- RnB and ballads? - Okay.

277
00:08:42,499 --> 00:08:44,197
- Okay. - Artist number one.

278
00:08:44,198 --> 00:08:46,268
- That's it. We asked two questions. - It's over.

279
00:08:46,269 --> 00:08:48,096
- We can only ask two questions. - Stop it. Hold back your question.

280
00:08:48,409 --> 00:08:49,408
- Hold it back. - All right.

281
00:08:49,409 --> 00:08:50,490
RnB and ballads?

282
00:08:50,578 --> 00:08:52,467
Who is she? RnB and ballads?

283
00:08:52,879 --> 00:08:55,317
- Question the second artist now. - Does he want to be famous?

284
00:08:55,318 --> 00:08:56,417
- Are you a singer? - That's what I want to know.

285
00:08:56,418 --> 00:08:58,136
- Are you a singer? - Do you want to be famous?

286
00:08:58,288 --> 00:08:59,865
Well, I...

287
00:09:01,659 --> 00:09:03,174
- He's not a singer. - Hold on.

288
00:09:03,558 --> 00:09:05,388
- No. He's obviously a comedian. - What was that?

289
00:09:05,389 --> 00:09:06,701
I'm not a comedian.

290
00:09:06,759 --> 00:09:07,970
You're not a comedian?

291
00:09:08,058 --> 00:09:09,128
We can ask one more question.

292
00:09:09,129 --> 00:09:10,358
- Let's ask him this. - Genre.

293
00:09:10,359 --> 00:09:12,998
Let's ask whose voice among ours will complement his voice the best.

294
00:09:12,999 --> 00:09:14,228
- Okay. - Yes.

295
00:09:14,229 --> 00:09:15,738
- Whose... - It'll be hard to know that.

296
00:09:15,739 --> 00:09:17,667
I will only accept questions about music.

297
00:09:17,668 --> 00:09:19,738
(He sounds firm.)

298
00:09:19,739 --> 00:09:20,868
- It has to be about music. - Ask him about genre.

299
00:09:20,869 --> 00:09:22,827
- It must be about music. - He's one arrogant guy!

300
00:09:22,979 --> 00:09:24,108
I don't know who he is,

301
00:09:24,109 --> 00:09:25,219
- but he sure is arrogant. - He refused to answer our question.

302
00:09:25,308 --> 00:09:27,778
- Ask him about the genre. - Okay. Ask him about the genre.

303
00:09:27,779 --> 00:09:29,566
What's your genre?

304
00:09:30,318 --> 00:09:32,944
RnB, hip-hop, indie music,

305
00:09:33,019 --> 00:09:34,018
and everything else.

306
00:09:34,019 --> 00:09:35,604
- Hip-hop? - He's a hip-hop artist.

307
00:09:35,688 --> 00:09:38,128
- RnB. - He must be a hip-hop artist.

308
00:09:38,129 --> 00:09:40,187
- RnB? - Their voices sound different.

309
00:09:40,188 --> 00:09:41,427
- There are 2 people? - Are there 2 people?

310
00:09:41,428 --> 00:09:43,528
- 2 people? Are there 2 people? - There are 2 people?

311
00:09:43,529 --> 00:09:44,998
- There's more than one musician? - Are they a pair?

312
00:09:44,999 --> 00:09:46,598
I know who they are!

313
00:09:46,599 --> 00:09:48,268
- Aren't they Dynamic Duo? - No, no.

314
00:09:48,269 --> 00:09:50,998
- The guys from "Show Me the Money". - Who?

315
00:09:50,999 --> 00:09:52,868
- Dok2 and The Quiett. - No, not them.

316
00:09:52,869 --> 00:09:54,037
- You know those famous guys? - All right.

317
00:09:54,038 --> 00:09:55,738
- Nafla and Loopy? - No, not them.

318
00:09:55,739 --> 00:09:57,238
Seok Jin, why did you twist my arm?

319
00:09:57,239 --> 00:09:58,408
(What's wrong with this guy?)

320
00:09:58,409 --> 00:09:59,822
Seok Jin, why did you twist my arm?

321
00:10:00,479 --> 00:10:02,717
- I didn't do anything wrong. - That's not how you play this.

322
00:10:02,718 --> 00:10:04,488
- Why did he twist my arm? - Why does he use force?

323
00:10:04,489 --> 00:10:05,817
- You're not supposed to do that. - I just remembered them.

324
00:10:05,818 --> 00:10:07,018
What made you twist my arm?

325
00:10:07,019 --> 00:10:09,018
- Why did you do that? - I just remembered them.

326
00:10:09,019 --> 00:10:11,528
- Don't do that when you're happy. - I was so happy.

327
00:10:11,529 --> 00:10:13,044
We can't ask the second artists...

328
00:10:13,328 --> 00:10:15,057
- any more questions. - We can't?

329
00:10:15,058 --> 00:10:16,258
What's their name?

330
00:10:16,259 --> 00:10:17,797
(Who are these artists that focus on hip-hop?)

331
00:10:17,798 --> 00:10:19,818
Ask the third artist your questions. Only two of us will ask.

332
00:10:20,328 --> 00:10:21,580
Can you ask him if he's a backup vocalist?

333
00:10:21,739 --> 00:10:23,138
- Is he a main vocalist? - You ask him.

334
00:10:23,139 --> 00:10:24,738
Are you a main vocalist?

335
00:10:24,739 --> 00:10:27,091
- Of course, he is. - We'll find out if he's in a group.

336
00:10:27,409 --> 00:10:29,077
- Yes. - He's the main vocalist.

337
00:10:29,078 --> 00:10:30,408
- He's the main vocalist. - He's in a group then.

338
00:10:30,409 --> 00:10:31,778
We don't know if he's in a group or not.

339
00:10:31,779 --> 00:10:33,108
Even if he's a solo artist,

340
00:10:33,109 --> 00:10:34,348
- he can still be a main vocalist. - He'd be a main vocalist.

341
00:10:34,349 --> 00:10:35,378
Hey.

342
00:10:35,379 --> 00:10:36,648
How could you waste a question like that?

343
00:10:36,649 --> 00:10:38,047
You wasted a question.

344
00:10:38,048 --> 00:10:40,348
- I'm sorry. - Discuss it before you ask.

345
00:10:40,349 --> 00:10:42,137
- Ask him if he's in a group. - If...

346
00:10:42,619 --> 00:10:44,087
- If you're in a group... - Ask them about the genre.

347
00:10:44,088 --> 00:10:45,158
Ask him about the genre.

348
00:10:45,159 --> 00:10:47,457
If you are in a group, how many of you are single?

349
00:10:47,458 --> 00:10:50,258
(She's pondering.)

350
00:10:50,259 --> 00:10:52,327
- You're unbelievable. - What would you ask him that?

351
00:10:52,328 --> 00:10:53,868
- What are you doing? - I mean...

352
00:10:53,869 --> 00:10:55,337
I was just curious.

353
00:10:55,338 --> 00:10:57,085
- You're unbelievable, So Min. - If you're in a group,

354
00:10:57,438 --> 00:10:58,667
- how many of you are single? - He's laughing.

355
00:10:58,668 --> 00:11:00,991
I'd also like to answer questions about music.

356
00:11:01,739 --> 00:11:03,677
- Okay. In that case, - Ask him about the genre.

357
00:11:03,678 --> 00:11:07,047
have you been ranked first place on music shows? How many times?

358
00:11:07,048 --> 00:11:08,462
- On music shows. - That's important.

359
00:11:09,119 --> 00:11:12,888
I usually perform at shows.

360
00:11:12,889 --> 00:11:14,047
(If he performs at shows...)

361
00:11:14,048 --> 00:11:16,008
- He's an indie singer. - An indie band!

362
00:11:16,458 --> 00:11:17,717
- I prefer indie bands. - They're an indie band.

363
00:11:17,718 --> 00:11:18,940
- Okay. All right. - That's cool.

364
00:11:19,129 --> 00:11:21,327
- We can't ask questions now. - It's over?

365
00:11:21,328 --> 00:11:23,427
- Only the last artist remains now. - The fourth artist.

366
00:11:23,428 --> 00:11:25,128
Should we ask her about her age?

367
00:11:25,129 --> 00:11:26,582
- Sure. Let's ask her about her age. - Yes.

368
00:11:26,798 --> 00:11:28,920
Artist number four, how old are you?

369
00:11:29,068 --> 00:11:31,167
I'm old enough.

370
00:11:31,168 --> 00:11:33,207
(I'm old enough.)

371
00:11:33,208 --> 00:11:34,437
Hey, she had a bit of an accent.

372
00:11:34,438 --> 00:11:35,577
She had an accent.

373
00:11:35,578 --> 00:11:37,278
- She's definitely older than us. - She's old enough.

374
00:11:37,279 --> 00:11:38,508
- She is older than us. - First of all...

375
00:11:38,509 --> 00:11:40,307
- First off, - Her tone...

376
00:11:40,308 --> 00:11:43,447
- she sounds experienced. - She sounds like a mom.

377
00:11:43,448 --> 00:11:46,074
- "I'm old enough." - "I'm old enough." Her accent...

378
00:11:46,448 --> 00:11:48,609
- Okay. One more question. - That's what my grandma says.

379
00:11:48,718 --> 00:11:51,557
- When did you debut? - In the 70s.

380
00:11:51,558 --> 00:11:54,358
- I was active in the 2000s. - It's the 2000s.

381
00:11:54,359 --> 00:11:56,984
- The 2000s. - She was active in the 2000s?

382
00:11:57,729 --> 00:11:59,228
- It could be Jin Young. - She must've been a late bloomer.

383
00:11:59,229 --> 00:12:02,369
In a way, her voice sounds...

384
00:12:02,499 --> 00:12:05,297
- It sounds familiar. - It does, doesn't it?

385
00:12:05,438 --> 00:12:08,878
We finished asking our official questions.

386
00:12:08,879 --> 00:12:12,307
I bet you're curious about the artists behind the doors now.

387
00:12:12,308 --> 00:12:14,307
- I'm dying to know right now. - Will they come out right away?

388
00:12:14,308 --> 00:12:16,547
- We'll end it here for this week. - What?

389
00:12:16,548 --> 00:12:17,817
(I know it's disappointing, but we'll end it here.)

390
00:12:17,818 --> 00:12:19,148
- What? - What was that?

391
00:12:19,149 --> 00:12:21,047
(We'll end it here for this week without bringing in the guests.)

392
00:12:21,048 --> 00:12:22,587
- What was that? - We'll end it here?

393
00:12:22,588 --> 00:12:23,717
- What are you doing? - I'm dying to know.

394
00:12:23,718 --> 00:12:24,787
- I'm so curious. - Tell us.

395
00:12:24,788 --> 00:12:25,787
We must end it when people get curious.

396
00:12:25,788 --> 00:12:27,898
- It's not a commercial break? - Right. It's over.

397
00:12:27,899 --> 00:12:29,128
Is there a baseball game after the show?

398
00:12:29,129 --> 00:12:30,270
- No, there isn't. - No?

399
00:12:30,428 --> 00:12:31,667
- Something else might air next. - What do we end it here?

400
00:12:31,668 --> 00:12:32,967
- Will something else air next? - That was short.

401
00:12:32,968 --> 00:12:34,656
We could have talked over the phone then.

402
00:12:35,639 --> 00:12:38,937
- You can sit over there. - Do we sit there?

403
00:12:38,938 --> 00:12:40,368
- Okay. - Before we bring in the artists,

404
00:12:40,369 --> 00:12:42,638
you'll pair up to form a team for today's mission.

405
00:12:42,639 --> 00:12:43,707
- Okay. - We'll form a team first?

406
00:12:43,708 --> 00:12:46,077
Two members will form a team with an artist.

407
00:12:46,078 --> 00:12:48,776
You can line up in front of the artist of your choice.

408
00:12:49,078 --> 00:12:51,348
If you catch the ball the artist throws,

409
00:12:51,349 --> 00:12:52,359
you'll form a team together.

410
00:12:52,749 --> 00:12:55,042
If you can't catch it, you won't be in that team.

411
00:12:55,659 --> 00:12:57,102
As for the first team,

412
00:12:57,188 --> 00:13:00,017
- we'll start with the first artist. - I think she's a good singer.

413
00:13:00,989 --> 00:13:05,776
(She's a hidden master who concealed her outstanding skills.)

414
00:13:06,328 --> 00:13:10,945
(RnB and ballads were her main focus.)

415
00:13:11,198 --> 00:13:12,967
- 1, 2, 3. - She's good.

416
00:13:12,968 --> 00:13:15,008
- She's an excellent singer. - She writes good ballad songs.

417
00:13:15,009 --> 00:13:16,452
I'll go for the first artist.

418
00:13:16,609 --> 00:13:19,148
- I'm going to try out too. - I was about to go too. Hey.

419
00:13:19,149 --> 00:13:21,148
I was going to try out too,

420
00:13:21,149 --> 00:13:23,038
but those members are like losers.

421
00:13:23,149 --> 00:13:24,748
The members who are trying out are like losers.

422
00:13:24,749 --> 00:13:25,917
Losers?

423
00:13:25,918 --> 00:13:27,917
- How could you say that? - I was going to try out too.

424
00:13:27,918 --> 00:13:28,917
- We're not losers. - How...

425
00:13:28,918 --> 00:13:31,584
Jee Stream, Grasshopper, Womanizer. What's wrong with us?

426
00:13:32,259 --> 00:13:33,528
(I won't join them.)

427
00:13:33,529 --> 00:13:35,519
- Okay. I'll go for it. - I have no choice.

428
00:13:35,558 --> 00:13:36,640
- I must be with her. - Let's go.

429
00:13:36,729 --> 00:13:39,067
- Why is he joining us? - Why are you here?

430
00:13:39,068 --> 00:13:40,268
The competition is fierce.

431
00:13:40,269 --> 00:13:41,797
My gosh, the first artist is so popular.

432
00:13:41,798 --> 00:13:43,498
I knew it. Singers must have pleasant voices.

433
00:13:43,499 --> 00:13:46,398
I think you, me, and the first would make a perfect team.

434
00:13:47,308 --> 00:13:49,037
- Our voices are... - They fit.

435
00:13:49,038 --> 00:13:51,037
- Our voices are... - If that happens,

436
00:13:51,038 --> 00:13:52,648
you'll have to dress up as Groot.

437
00:13:52,649 --> 00:13:53,778
- Why? - No.

438
00:13:53,779 --> 00:13:55,677
- We'll be a duet. - Right.

439
00:13:55,678 --> 00:13:57,378
He can be one of our backup dancers.

440
00:13:57,379 --> 00:13:58,701
Right.

441
00:13:59,448 --> 00:14:02,519
(Due to his height, he'll serve as a great background.)

442
00:14:02,788 --> 00:14:04,827
- That'll be your fate. - Let's find out.

443
00:14:04,828 --> 00:14:07,111
I've never done a duet with a female singer.

444
00:14:07,529 --> 00:14:09,228
Has he never?

445
00:14:09,229 --> 00:14:10,916
Seriously?

446
00:14:10,999 --> 00:14:12,598
- You're right. - Yes. I've never done it.

447
00:14:12,599 --> 00:14:16,437
You can introduce yourselves one by one.

448
00:14:16,698 --> 00:14:17,849
Hello.

449
00:14:18,109 --> 00:14:22,118
I'm Jee Seok Jin, a singer who has made one album.

450
00:14:22,239 --> 00:14:24,158
I have quite some knowledge in music.

451
00:14:24,338 --> 00:14:27,177
I'll consider you as my senior and serve you well.

452
00:14:27,409 --> 00:14:30,478
I'm number one, Jee Seok Jin, the well-versed singer.

453
00:14:30,479 --> 00:14:32,166
- That was boring. - It was.

454
00:14:32,889 --> 00:14:34,404
(They almost fell asleep.)

455
00:14:34,448 --> 00:14:35,832
I was being honest.

456
00:14:36,718 --> 00:14:38,358
I'll show you my singing skills.

457
00:14:38,359 --> 00:14:39,369
(Se Chan decides to sing.)

458
00:14:39,529 --> 00:14:40,942
(A thousand years)

459
00:14:42,029 --> 00:14:44,197
(Se Chan doesn't seem too promising either.)

460
00:14:44,198 --> 00:14:45,868
- Goodness. - He won't pass.

461
00:14:45,869 --> 00:14:47,128
He'll fail.

462
00:14:47,129 --> 00:14:48,598
(Nevertheless, he continues.)

463
00:14:48,599 --> 00:14:50,013
That sounds terrible.

464
00:14:50,068 --> 00:14:51,655
I can reach very high notes.

465
00:14:51,739 --> 00:14:52,908
I'm number two.

466
00:14:52,909 --> 00:14:55,008
- You won't pass. - As for me,

467
00:14:55,009 --> 00:14:56,423
I'll be standing far away.

468
00:14:56,479 --> 00:14:57,837
- The farthest? - Yes.

469
00:14:57,838 --> 00:15:00,978
I'll stand to the right of you.

470
00:15:00,979 --> 00:15:03,248
Okay. Where are you, Jong Kook?

471
00:15:03,249 --> 00:15:05,875
- I'm here. I'm the farthest. - She's already made her choice.

472
00:15:05,918 --> 00:15:07,000
I'm the farthest.

473
00:15:07,389 --> 00:15:09,105
You can throw it now!

474
00:15:09,288 --> 00:15:10,429
Here it goes.

475
00:15:11,159 --> 00:15:13,128
(The ball passes Seok Jin and Se Chan.)

476
00:15:13,129 --> 00:15:16,290
(It's flying towards Jong Kook.)

477
00:15:17,359 --> 00:15:19,868
(I caught it!)

478
00:15:19,869 --> 00:15:22,868
(Kwang Soo catches it.)

479
00:15:23,869 --> 00:15:26,191
(He intervenes.)

480
00:15:26,968 --> 00:15:28,625
(Snatching)

481
00:15:28,779 --> 00:15:29,778
Okay!

482
00:15:29,779 --> 00:15:32,008
(Wait for me! I'll be with you!)

483
00:15:32,009 --> 00:15:33,019
Hey.

484
00:15:33,448 --> 00:15:34,848
Goodness.

485
00:15:34,849 --> 00:15:37,217
Do you know who caught the ball?

486
00:15:37,218 --> 00:15:38,518
Jong Kook?

487
00:15:38,519 --> 00:15:40,018
No, it was Kwang Soo.

488
00:15:40,019 --> 00:15:41,160
I see.

489
00:15:43,588 --> 00:15:45,649
(Does she hate me that much?)

490
00:15:46,529 --> 00:15:48,128
(You deserve that.)

491
00:15:48,129 --> 00:15:49,674
- She's disappointed. - I'm...

492
00:15:49,958 --> 00:15:52,197
Seok Jin. I'm the closest to you!

493
00:15:52,198 --> 00:15:53,498
Where are you, Jong Kook?

494
00:15:53,499 --> 00:15:55,053
- I'm the closest to you! - Hold on.

495
00:15:55,369 --> 00:15:57,868
(She has her eyes set on only one person.)

496
00:15:57,869 --> 00:16:00,067
- Hold on. - Excuse me.

497
00:16:00,068 --> 00:16:01,553
She wants to partner up with Jong Kook.

498
00:16:01,808 --> 00:16:03,021
She's already made her choice.

499
00:16:03,178 --> 00:16:04,437
- Please throw it. - We'll catch it.

500
00:16:04,438 --> 00:16:05,577
Okay.

501
00:16:05,578 --> 00:16:08,709
(Jong Kook catches it.)

502
00:16:09,078 --> 00:16:10,835
Okay. I got it.

503
00:16:11,649 --> 00:16:12,917
Goodness.

504
00:16:12,918 --> 00:16:15,040
Hey, Kwang Soo looks unhappy.

505
00:16:15,058 --> 00:16:17,258
- Not at all. - He'll be a backup dancer.

506
00:16:17,259 --> 00:16:18,658
Not at all.

507
00:16:18,659 --> 00:16:20,528
- You're an outsider. - No, I'm fine.

508
00:16:20,529 --> 00:16:22,215
This is exactly how I predicted it.

509
00:16:22,399 --> 00:16:24,797
- Let us meet... - I'm anticipating.

510
00:16:24,798 --> 00:16:26,197
the first artist.

511
00:16:26,198 --> 00:16:27,827
Will her partners come out too?

512
00:16:27,828 --> 00:16:30,090
Who is it? I'm dying to find out!

513
00:16:30,338 --> 00:16:33,368
- Me too. - Romantic Punch and Womanizer.

514
00:16:33,369 --> 00:16:34,793
- "Romantic Punch"? - They'll be a team.

515
00:16:34,909 --> 00:16:36,626
Romantic Punch and Womanizer.

516
00:16:36,639 --> 00:16:39,047
Please come on out.

517
00:16:39,048 --> 00:16:40,694
(Everyone is anticipating.)

518
00:16:40,879 --> 00:16:41,917
Who is it?

519
00:16:41,918 --> 00:16:44,141
(Who is the 1st artist?)

520
00:16:44,349 --> 00:16:45,717
- It's Gummy! - It's Gummy!

521
00:16:45,718 --> 00:16:47,809
(1st artist, Gummy)

522
00:16:48,989 --> 00:16:50,817
(She's the best ballad singer in this country...)

523
00:16:50,818 --> 00:16:52,778
(with her unique and mellow voice.)

524
00:16:53,889 --> 00:16:55,457
("Gummy, the Queen of Soundtracks")

525
00:16:55,458 --> 00:16:57,045
("Gummy Receives 2016 Asia Artist Awards")

526
00:16:57,798 --> 00:16:59,768
(She is the queen of soundtracks...)

527
00:16:59,769 --> 00:17:04,747
(and also the queen of duets.)

528
00:17:05,639 --> 00:17:10,659
(Her charms will mesmerize you forever.)

529
00:17:10,938 --> 00:17:12,648
- It's Gummy! - It's Gummy!

530
00:17:12,649 --> 00:17:13,891
(It's the mighty Gummy.)

531
00:17:13,909 --> 00:17:15,977
(They're surprised.)

532
00:17:15,978 --> 00:17:17,378
It was you.

533
00:17:17,379 --> 00:17:18,487
Hey.

534
00:17:18,488 --> 00:17:19,648
Goodness, this is amazing.

535
00:17:19,649 --> 00:17:20,687
- It's amazing. - It is.

536
00:17:20,688 --> 00:17:22,476
- Hello. - Hi, Gummy.

537
00:17:22,819 --> 00:17:24,434
I had no idea.

538
00:17:24,518 --> 00:17:27,058
I'm looking forward to Jong Kook and Gummy's duet performance.

539
00:17:27,059 --> 00:17:28,527
But she's way too good.

540
00:17:28,528 --> 00:17:29,757
I am looking forward too.

541
00:17:29,758 --> 00:17:31,598
I'm really looking forward to them performing.

542
00:17:31,599 --> 00:17:33,667
- Me too. - They look good together.

543
00:17:33,668 --> 00:17:35,154
- Their voices match. - Hey.

544
00:17:35,339 --> 00:17:37,267
He said it's a collaboration between a spider and a mosquito.

545
00:17:37,268 --> 00:17:38,925
(He tattletales on Se Chan.)

546
00:17:39,008 --> 00:17:40,038
(It's a harmony of insects.)

547
00:17:40,039 --> 00:17:42,108
- Don't say that. - I didn't say that.

548
00:17:42,109 --> 00:17:44,338
- No, no. - What did you just say?

549
00:17:44,339 --> 00:17:45,747
Hey, come here.

550
00:17:45,748 --> 00:17:47,277
I can kill you with some insect repellent.

551
00:17:47,278 --> 00:17:48,834
This is a nice match.

552
00:17:48,849 --> 00:17:52,348
There is a spider, a mosquito, and a long-headed grasshopper.

553
00:17:52,349 --> 00:17:53,888
- He's a swallow. - He's a water strider.

554
00:17:53,889 --> 00:17:54,987
(Kwang Soo is pretty much invisible.)

555
00:17:54,988 --> 00:17:56,318
Gummy.

556
00:17:56,319 --> 00:17:58,752
The first artist was Gummy.

557
00:17:58,829 --> 00:18:00,040
You should've given us a heads-up.

558
00:18:00,659 --> 00:18:01,798
I know.

559
00:18:01,799 --> 00:18:04,628
We will do the interviews later.

560
00:18:04,629 --> 00:18:06,068
- Okay. - Please sit down.

561
00:18:06,069 --> 00:18:08,267
- Sit down. - Number one was for ballad songs.

562
00:18:08,268 --> 00:18:11,197
I really look forward to Jong Kook and Gummy.

563
00:18:11,198 --> 00:18:12,237
Me too.

564
00:18:12,238 --> 00:18:14,338
(They're a fantastic duo.)

565
00:18:14,339 --> 00:18:15,808
That's enough!

566
00:18:15,809 --> 00:18:16,808
(Kwang Soo is useless.)

567
00:18:16,809 --> 00:18:19,030
I really look forward to their performance.

568
00:18:19,109 --> 00:18:21,477
But these teams aren't fixed.

569
00:18:21,478 --> 00:18:22,548
- Right. - Right.

570
00:18:22,549 --> 00:18:24,417
- It's not fixed. - No, it's not.

571
00:18:24,418 --> 00:18:28,318
Now, let's move on to the second artist.

572
00:18:28,319 --> 00:18:29,429
(They move onto the 2nd door.)

573
00:18:29,619 --> 00:18:33,264
(They were criticized for their oddly-familiar voices.)

574
00:18:33,958 --> 00:18:36,958
(Everyone thought they were amateur singers.)

575
00:18:36,998 --> 00:18:40,100
(But they claimed to specialize in RnB and hip-hop.)

576
00:18:40,129 --> 00:18:42,598
(Who are they?)

577
00:18:42,599 --> 00:18:45,308
This is the second room.

578
00:18:45,309 --> 00:18:46,380
Come on out.

579
00:18:46,708 --> 00:18:48,437
- Many of you are going. - It's the easiest.

580
00:18:48,438 --> 00:18:51,166
- I know. - I want to partner up with them.

581
00:18:51,309 --> 00:18:54,078
Hello, I enjoy hip-hop and RnB.

582
00:18:54,079 --> 00:18:55,578
I can do many different genres.

583
00:18:55,579 --> 00:18:59,326
Who's your favorite hip-hop, RnB artist?

584
00:18:59,748 --> 00:19:01,417
(They want to know how well she knows the genres.)

585
00:19:01,418 --> 00:19:02,904
I like Drunken Tiger.

586
00:19:03,488 --> 00:19:06,357
(Drunken Tiger debuted in 1999.)

587
00:19:06,428 --> 00:19:08,697
- That was a terrible answer. - They're very old.

588
00:19:08,698 --> 00:19:10,957
- So Min doesn't know much... - Hey.

589
00:19:10,958 --> 00:19:12,967
- She's old-school. - about these genres.

590
00:19:12,968 --> 00:19:14,068
I think it's over. Come in.

591
00:19:14,069 --> 00:19:15,412
I like Free Style!

592
00:19:16,069 --> 00:19:17,767
(Laughing)

593
00:19:17,768 --> 00:19:20,668
- Free Style? I see. - We use it for Cyworld.

594
00:19:21,238 --> 00:19:23,078
We'd set their song as our background music.

595
00:19:23,079 --> 00:19:24,755
Right, it was "Y".

596
00:19:24,809 --> 00:19:25,808
All right.

597
00:19:25,809 --> 00:19:27,378
I want to perform with you.

598
00:19:27,379 --> 00:19:29,648
I am confident I can do well.

599
00:19:29,649 --> 00:19:32,213
Okay, well, I don't have much to tell you.

600
00:19:32,218 --> 00:19:33,648
(They're flustered.)

601
00:19:33,649 --> 00:19:35,858
Can we move on?

602
00:19:35,859 --> 00:19:37,939
- Why aren't you asking me anything? - Step back.

603
00:19:38,119 --> 00:19:40,917
I bet they watched her singing on YouTube.

604
00:19:41,289 --> 00:19:43,015
- Did you? - I think they did.

605
00:19:43,599 --> 00:19:44,628
(She gives up.)

606
00:19:44,629 --> 00:19:46,316
No wonder they don't want to team up with her.

607
00:19:46,599 --> 00:19:48,027
- I think they watched it. - I think so.

608
00:19:48,028 --> 00:19:49,197
It can't be helped then.

609
00:19:49,198 --> 00:19:50,538
Hello, I'm Yang Se Chan.

610
00:19:50,539 --> 00:19:51,937
Hello.

611
00:19:51,938 --> 00:19:52,978
- What? - They like you.

612
00:19:53,008 --> 00:19:56,069
(They're hospitable towards him.)

613
00:19:56,309 --> 00:19:58,056
It seems like you want to become famous.

614
00:19:58,278 --> 00:19:59,692
I can help you with that.

615
00:19:59,708 --> 00:20:00,808
Help yourself.

616
00:20:00,809 --> 00:20:02,464
(He acts arrogantly.)

617
00:20:02,518 --> 00:20:03,848
(Haha gives him a reality check.)

618
00:20:03,849 --> 00:20:05,464
I'll help you.

619
00:20:05,549 --> 00:20:06,917
- Okay, go stand. - Hey.

620
00:20:06,918 --> 00:20:08,888
- I'm Haha. - I'll be behind Haha.

621
00:20:08,889 --> 00:20:10,687
We want Se Chan.

622
00:20:10,688 --> 00:20:12,027
- Where is he? - They want Se Chan.

623
00:20:12,028 --> 00:20:13,427
They want me?

624
00:20:13,428 --> 00:20:14,727
They really like him.

625
00:20:14,728 --> 00:20:16,227
- They really do. - They like me.

626
00:20:16,228 --> 00:20:18,926
- Se Chan, please come close. - Why him?

627
00:20:19,028 --> 00:20:20,167
Okay, I did.

628
00:20:20,168 --> 00:20:21,279
(I'm here!)

629
00:20:21,899 --> 00:20:23,181
- What? - Where did it go?

630
00:20:23,569 --> 00:20:24,568
(What?)

631
00:20:24,569 --> 00:20:26,022
(Why did they throw it so far away?)

632
00:20:26,539 --> 00:20:27,882
(Haha reaches the ball first.)

633
00:20:28,139 --> 00:20:30,401
- Nice! - Haha caught the ball.

634
00:20:31,039 --> 00:20:32,878
Where should I stand? It's me, Se Chan!

635
00:20:32,879 --> 00:20:34,596
It's over.

636
00:20:34,708 --> 00:20:36,017
- What? - You may return.

637
00:20:36,018 --> 00:20:37,777
- It's over? - Se Chan, go sit down.

638
00:20:37,778 --> 00:20:39,365
Hey! You have a ball left!

639
00:20:39,549 --> 00:20:41,318
- He's mad. - He is.

640
00:20:41,319 --> 00:20:42,658
- He's mad. - You have a ball!

641
00:20:42,659 --> 00:20:44,073
- Who are you guys? - I'm upset too!

642
00:20:44,218 --> 00:20:45,572
- Who are you? - All right.

643
00:20:45,728 --> 00:20:47,628
- I'm going to catch it. - Do you know...

644
00:20:47,629 --> 00:20:49,227
where Haha is?

645
00:20:49,228 --> 00:20:50,427
- He caught it. - He caught it.

646
00:20:50,428 --> 00:20:51,727
- He did? - Yes.

647
00:20:51,728 --> 00:20:55,497
Okay. That was a bad throw.

648
00:20:55,498 --> 00:20:56,568
Okay.

649
00:20:56,569 --> 00:20:57,767
- Who are they? - They're toying with them.

650
00:20:57,768 --> 00:20:58,920
I'm not doing this either!

651
00:21:00,109 --> 00:21:01,321
They're toying with us.

652
00:21:01,438 --> 00:21:03,398
- He already caught one. - I'm so curious about them.

653
00:21:03,738 --> 00:21:05,578
They know how to toy with us.

654
00:21:05,579 --> 00:21:06,977
They must've been emcees before.

655
00:21:06,978 --> 00:21:08,837
- Is that MC Ding Dong? - It could be.

656
00:21:09,278 --> 00:21:10,277
MC Ding Dong?

657
00:21:10,278 --> 00:21:11,763
- Goodness. - Ji Hyo!

658
00:21:12,349 --> 00:21:13,788
(The ball is thrown.)

659
00:21:13,789 --> 00:21:15,257
(Ji Hyo catches the ball.)

660
00:21:15,258 --> 00:21:17,088
- She caught it. - Go sit down.

661
00:21:17,089 --> 00:21:18,318
How could they throw it while we were talking?

662
00:21:18,319 --> 00:21:20,247
That's fine. That's up to them.

663
00:21:20,458 --> 00:21:21,973
- How could they? - They were faking it.

664
00:21:22,159 --> 00:21:23,916
Let's see who they are.

665
00:21:24,528 --> 00:21:25,868
Come on out.

666
00:21:25,869 --> 00:21:27,716
- Who are they? I'm curious. - Who are they?

667
00:21:31,839 --> 00:21:32,908
It's Code Kunst!

668
00:21:32,909 --> 00:21:35,201
(The second artists are Nucksal and Code Kunst.)

669
00:21:35,339 --> 00:21:37,408
(Nucksal went from an underground rapper...)

670
00:21:37,409 --> 00:21:39,468
(to a leader of hip-hop music.)

671
00:21:39,508 --> 00:21:41,348
("His Rapping Skills Are Commendable")

672
00:21:41,349 --> 00:21:43,477
("Nucksal Is Known for His Crazy Raps")

673
00:21:43,478 --> 00:21:44,947
(Code Kunst is the master of producing hip-hop music.)

674
00:21:44,948 --> 00:21:47,312
(All hip-hop artists admire him.)

675
00:21:47,319 --> 00:21:48,757
("Genius Producer with over 400 Beats")

676
00:21:48,758 --> 00:21:50,536
("He Is the New Number One Composer")

677
00:21:50,559 --> 00:21:53,558
(The two unique artists have come out together.)

678
00:21:54,559 --> 00:21:56,447
They're Code Kunst and Nucksal!

679
00:21:56,599 --> 00:21:58,074
(This is an even more monumental moment because...)

680
00:21:58,198 --> 00:22:00,727
(Nucksal is known to look like Ji Hyo.)

681
00:22:00,728 --> 00:22:01,850
Nucksal is here!

682
00:22:01,968 --> 00:22:03,267
Seriously!

683
00:22:03,268 --> 00:22:04,410
(Nucksal feels like a family member.)

684
00:22:06,008 --> 00:22:08,777
It's so nice to meet you. I'm a big fan.

685
00:22:08,778 --> 00:22:09,937
He really came out!

686
00:22:09,938 --> 00:22:11,424
- He really did. - They look exactly alike.

687
00:22:11,778 --> 00:22:14,408
- He really came! - They look alike.

688
00:22:14,409 --> 00:22:15,833
(How much do they look alike, you ask?)

689
00:22:15,849 --> 00:22:18,078
They look similar.

690
00:22:18,079 --> 00:22:19,917
Goodness. I wanted to see him.

691
00:22:19,918 --> 00:22:21,201
My gosh.

692
00:22:22,059 --> 00:22:23,417
(She can't help looking at him.)

693
00:22:23,418 --> 00:22:25,828
- They look alike. - Nucksal.

694
00:22:25,829 --> 00:22:27,128
Do we really look alike?

695
00:22:27,129 --> 00:22:29,654
You guys do look alike.

696
00:22:29,728 --> 00:22:31,398
- I can't tell the difference. - We look alike.

697
00:22:31,399 --> 00:22:33,027
I really wanted to see you.

698
00:22:33,028 --> 00:22:35,368
He's become quite popular in the hip-hop scene.

699
00:22:35,369 --> 00:22:36,914
He's so good with words.

700
00:22:36,968 --> 00:22:38,967
He's like the Yu Jae Seok of hip-hop.

701
00:22:38,968 --> 00:22:42,207
No wonder. They were so good at talking.

702
00:22:42,208 --> 00:22:43,623
Goodness.

703
00:22:43,678 --> 00:22:45,608
- This is amazing. - Nucksal is finally here.

704
00:22:45,609 --> 00:22:47,908
I really wanted to see you.

705
00:22:47,909 --> 00:22:50,504
Nucksal is witnessing the 40-year-old him.

706
00:22:51,379 --> 00:22:53,318
- This is great. - It is.

707
00:22:53,319 --> 00:22:54,687
It's wonderful.

708
00:22:54,688 --> 00:22:56,858
- This is incredible. - Goodness.

709
00:22:56,859 --> 00:22:58,088
- Right. - This is amazing.

710
00:22:58,089 --> 00:23:00,109
Where should I go?

711
00:23:00,528 --> 00:23:03,527
Perhaps, it because of her outfit.

712
00:23:03,528 --> 00:23:05,697
But Gummy looks like the owner of this mansion.

713
00:23:05,698 --> 00:23:06,738
(She looks like the owner.)

714
00:23:06,869 --> 00:23:09,298
- She looks successful. - Right.

715
00:23:09,299 --> 00:23:10,638
She looks like a successful realtor...

716
00:23:10,639 --> 00:23:11,981
- in LA. - I know.

717
00:23:12,139 --> 00:23:14,638
What's important is that these teams are not fixed.

718
00:23:14,639 --> 00:23:16,538
- Really? - Yes. Because...

719
00:23:16,539 --> 00:23:17,638
I'm not talking about anyone in particular,

720
00:23:17,639 --> 00:23:20,103
but we won't succeed like this.

721
00:23:20,278 --> 00:23:21,288
What?

722
00:23:22,418 --> 00:23:23,648
Why were you pointing at me?

723
00:23:23,649 --> 00:23:24,878
- I wasn't. - He wasn't talking about you.

724
00:23:24,879 --> 00:23:26,388
- We're a set. - Okay.

725
00:23:26,389 --> 00:23:27,747
- He didn't mention your name. - I mean...

726
00:23:27,748 --> 00:23:29,517
- They won't be whole without me. - Right.

727
00:23:29,518 --> 00:23:31,913
This just won't work.

728
00:23:31,928 --> 00:23:34,058
I'm just saying some corrections are needed.

729
00:23:34,059 --> 00:23:35,257
All right.

730
00:23:35,258 --> 00:23:37,227
- Now... - I'm aiming for the fourth artist.

731
00:23:37,228 --> 00:23:39,187
Let's move onto the third room.

732
00:23:39,329 --> 00:23:40,328
Here we go.

733
00:23:40,329 --> 00:23:41,379
(The 3rd artist is...)

734
00:23:42,039 --> 00:23:45,069
(He seemed to enjoy making others laugh.)

735
00:23:45,309 --> 00:23:46,722
(His singing voice sounded stable.)

736
00:23:47,609 --> 00:23:49,558
(He also said he did concerts.)

737
00:23:49,609 --> 00:23:51,638
(Is he in an indie band?)

738
00:23:51,639 --> 00:23:52,708
(Who is the 3rd artist?)

739
00:23:52,709 --> 00:23:53,778
- Okay. - Third artist.

740
00:23:53,779 --> 00:23:55,147
- We should go. - Should we?

741
00:23:55,148 --> 00:23:57,048
- For now... - So many are going.

742
00:23:57,049 --> 00:23:58,463
Everyone's going.

743
00:23:59,148 --> 00:24:03,087
Hello, I'm Jeon So Min. I'll do my best!

744
00:24:03,088 --> 00:24:04,558
(He shouts loudly.)

745
00:24:04,559 --> 00:24:06,649
Are you a freshman in college?

746
00:24:06,759 --> 00:24:07,958
What are you doing?

747
00:24:07,959 --> 00:24:09,157
Please pick me!

748
00:24:09,158 --> 00:24:10,558
What is she doing?

749
00:24:10,559 --> 00:24:12,228
Okay. Next, please.

750
00:24:12,229 --> 00:24:13,968
Next, next.

751
00:24:13,969 --> 00:24:15,685
(The freshman is rejected.)

752
00:24:15,898 --> 00:24:16,949
Get out.

753
00:24:17,269 --> 00:24:18,837
- Next. - Hello, this is Yang Se Chan.

754
00:24:18,838 --> 00:24:20,407
I've finally come to my senses.

755
00:24:20,408 --> 00:24:22,125
When you sang for the first artist,

756
00:24:22,479 --> 00:24:25,308
your high pitch was memorable. We value that a lot.

757
00:24:25,309 --> 00:24:27,702
(His high-pitch singing was memorable to him.)

758
00:24:27,779 --> 00:24:28,778
Really?

759
00:24:28,779 --> 00:24:31,147
(Singing)

760
00:24:31,148 --> 00:24:33,347
(He tries to win some points.)

761
00:24:33,348 --> 00:24:34,518
He likes it.

762
00:24:34,519 --> 00:24:36,609
(So Min sings as well.)

763
00:24:37,459 --> 00:24:39,327
(What is that?)

764
00:24:39,328 --> 00:24:40,327
(They try to win his favor.)

765
00:24:40,328 --> 00:24:41,641
So Min, come here.

766
00:24:41,858 --> 00:24:42,958
Come here.

767
00:24:42,959 --> 00:24:44,558
(They're happy that they didn't choose them.)

768
00:24:44,559 --> 00:24:46,144
Hello, I'm Yu Jae Seok.

769
00:24:46,868 --> 00:24:47,998
- What was that? - What?

770
00:24:47,999 --> 00:24:50,538
- He's good at high-pitched singing. - She's getting right in this.

771
00:24:50,539 --> 00:24:53,067
I'm a big fan. Can I listen to your high-pitched singing?

772
00:24:53,068 --> 00:24:54,667
Here you go.

773
00:24:54,668 --> 00:24:57,102
(Se Chan pinches him.)

774
00:24:57,809 --> 00:25:00,448
(Se Chan gets the highest pitched sound out of him.)

775
00:25:00,449 --> 00:25:02,248
- Was that nice? - That was wonderful.

776
00:25:02,249 --> 00:25:04,317
- Really? - Yes. It was commendable.

777
00:25:04,318 --> 00:25:06,688
All right. Please throw the ball.

778
00:25:06,689 --> 00:25:07,718
Hold on.

779
00:25:07,719 --> 00:25:08,887
The fourth artist has something to say.

780
00:25:08,888 --> 00:25:11,847
Hi. I'm the last one.

781
00:25:11,989 --> 00:25:14,688
Does that mean I don't have a choice?

782
00:25:14,689 --> 00:25:16,357
- She's right. - Right.

783
00:25:16,358 --> 00:25:17,758
They should go simultaneously.

784
00:25:17,759 --> 00:25:19,667
- Right. - I'm disappointed.

785
00:25:19,668 --> 00:25:21,214
She's so experienced.

786
00:25:21,299 --> 00:25:23,397
She's right.

787
00:25:23,398 --> 00:25:24,954
(The 4th artist seems to know well.)

788
00:25:25,638 --> 00:25:28,337
(She had an experienced, sorrowful voice.)

789
00:25:28,338 --> 00:25:30,377
(She sounded like a very experienced singer.)

790
00:25:30,378 --> 00:25:34,216
(However, she debuted quite late.)

791
00:25:34,809 --> 00:25:36,317
(Who is the 4th artist?)

792
00:25:36,318 --> 00:25:39,518
Does the fourth artist have anyone she likes in particular?

793
00:25:39,519 --> 00:25:41,983
As long as it's not Seok Jin, I'm fine.

794
00:25:42,989 --> 00:25:44,688
Then we can exclude him.

795
00:25:44,689 --> 00:25:47,112
- How dare she? - She doesn't want you.

796
00:25:47,459 --> 00:25:48,872
I'm going to catch her ball.

797
00:25:49,658 --> 00:25:52,425
You just wait! I'm coming for you!

798
00:25:53,269 --> 00:25:55,867
- Please throw your balls. - That's hilarious.

799
00:25:55,868 --> 00:25:57,667
Where is Se Chan?

800
00:25:57,668 --> 00:25:59,285
I'm in front of the fourth door.

801
00:25:59,939 --> 00:26:01,938
Stay there. I'll throw it towards you.

802
00:26:01,939 --> 00:26:03,797
- Okay. - Third artist.

803
00:26:04,178 --> 00:26:05,462
Please throw your ball.

804
00:26:05,979 --> 00:26:07,577
- Please catch it. - All right.

805
00:26:07,578 --> 00:26:08,677
(Murmuring)

806
00:26:08,678 --> 00:26:09,729
So Min, what are you doing?

807
00:26:11,249 --> 00:26:12,430
(The ball goes to So Min.)

808
00:26:12,949 --> 00:26:14,332
Why did you talk to me?

809
00:26:14,888 --> 00:26:16,332
(Haha distracted him.)

810
00:26:16,459 --> 00:26:18,788
Why did he interrupt me?

811
00:26:18,789 --> 00:26:21,384
A player doesn't look at the audience when they're noisy.

812
00:26:21,388 --> 00:26:23,327
He's one funny guy.

813
00:26:23,328 --> 00:26:25,798
- Why did you act that way? - Come on.

814
00:26:25,799 --> 00:26:27,597
- He should have something. - I know.

815
00:26:27,598 --> 00:26:29,468
I really like So Min.

816
00:26:29,469 --> 00:26:31,538
- What? - I really like So Min.

817
00:26:31,539 --> 00:26:32,567
- Thank you. - Fourth artist.

818
00:26:32,568 --> 00:26:34,167
Where is Se Chan?

819
00:26:34,168 --> 00:26:36,177
Seok Jin is far back.

820
00:26:36,178 --> 00:26:38,360
- Okay. - Se Chan is...

821
00:26:38,709 --> 00:26:40,527
right in front of you.

822
00:26:40,709 --> 00:26:42,448
Seok Jin is the farthest.

823
00:26:42,449 --> 00:26:43,817
- Get ready. - I'm right in front of you.

824
00:26:43,818 --> 00:26:44,817
Get ready.

825
00:26:44,818 --> 00:26:45,828
(They're planning to create the oldest duo.)

826
00:26:45,888 --> 00:26:46,887
Go.

827
00:26:46,888 --> 00:26:47,898
(Se Chan is in front.)

828
00:26:48,888 --> 00:26:50,387
Seok Jin is in the back.

829
00:26:50,388 --> 00:26:51,732
(Seok Jin takes the ball.)

830
00:26:52,529 --> 00:26:55,657
Now, you'll take turns throwing your balls again.

831
00:26:55,658 --> 00:26:57,157
- Third artist. - Here I go.

832
00:26:57,158 --> 00:26:58,168
Okay.

833
00:26:58,559 --> 00:27:00,067
(The 3rd artist is teamed up with So Min and Jae Seok.)

834
00:27:00,068 --> 00:27:01,067
What is this?

835
00:27:01,068 --> 00:27:03,397
All right. Let's meet them.

836
00:27:03,398 --> 00:27:06,267
Third artist, please come on out.

837
00:27:08,709 --> 00:27:10,137
It's SORAN.

838
00:27:10,138 --> 00:27:13,612
(Third artist, SORAN)

839
00:27:13,979 --> 00:27:15,677
(SORAN is a four-member band that has performed...)

840
00:27:15,678 --> 00:27:17,365
(in many music festivals.)

841
00:27:17,578 --> 00:27:19,647
("SORAN Has Amazing and Lovely Lyrics")

842
00:27:19,648 --> 00:27:21,810
("SORAN Steals the Hearts of Women")

843
00:27:22,059 --> 00:27:25,725
(They're a competent band that sings songs of comfort.)

844
00:27:26,559 --> 00:27:27,558
(Hello, we're SORAN.)

845
00:27:27,559 --> 00:27:29,618
Hello, Young Bae.

846
00:27:30,128 --> 00:27:31,558
- Hello. - Hello.

847
00:27:31,559 --> 00:27:33,028
- Hello. - It's SORAN.

848
00:27:33,029 --> 00:27:34,367
- Hello. - Hello.

849
00:27:34,368 --> 00:27:35,667
It's SORAN.

850
00:27:35,668 --> 00:27:37,468
"I Study You".

851
00:27:37,469 --> 00:27:39,067
- You must like them. - Totally.

852
00:27:39,068 --> 00:27:40,867
Didn't you go on stage with So Min before?

853
00:27:40,868 --> 00:27:42,077
- Yes. - A long time ago.

854
00:27:42,078 --> 00:27:44,533
- Right? Goodness. - It was during a festival.

855
00:27:44,578 --> 00:27:47,448
We still have our fourth artist, so please sit over there.

856
00:27:47,449 --> 00:27:48,589
Fourth artist.

857
00:27:49,249 --> 00:27:52,688
She seems like a very experienced trot singer.

858
00:27:52,689 --> 00:27:54,587
- She's like a teacher. - Yes.

859
00:27:54,588 --> 00:27:56,436
Please come on out.

860
00:27:57,158 --> 00:27:59,885
(Who is the 4th artist who will team up with Se Chan and Seok Jin?)

861
00:28:02,328 --> 00:28:04,657
(It's Apink.)

862
00:28:04,658 --> 00:28:05,798
It's Apink.

863
00:28:05,799 --> 00:28:08,596
(Fourth artist, Apink)

864
00:28:08,868 --> 00:28:09,867
(They debuted 8 years ago.)

865
00:28:09,868 --> 00:28:13,038
(Every album that they've released had at least one hit song.)

866
00:28:13,039 --> 00:28:14,137
("Apink Has Become More Mature and Skilled")

867
00:28:14,138 --> 00:28:15,280
("Apink Members Are Both Beautiful and Talented")

868
00:28:15,608 --> 00:28:18,811
(They appeared on the show often and always attracted high ratings.)

869
00:28:19,578 --> 00:28:20,877
(They agreed to come out once again.)

870
00:28:20,878 --> 00:28:23,576
(All the members have come out.)

871
00:28:24,578 --> 00:28:26,468
- It's Apink! - It's Apink!

872
00:28:27,418 --> 00:28:30,317
- They all came! - You should've told us it was you!

873
00:28:30,318 --> 00:28:32,458
- Goodness! - I had no idea.

874
00:28:32,459 --> 00:28:34,357
- Hey, you should've told us! - I had no idea.

875
00:28:34,358 --> 00:28:36,753
- Come on! - What is this?

876
00:28:37,229 --> 00:28:38,327
What is this?

877
00:28:38,328 --> 00:28:41,698
They wanted to be as far away as possible from Seok Jin.

878
00:28:41,699 --> 00:28:42,849
Oh, no.

879
00:28:43,299 --> 00:28:45,438
- Seok Jin thought... - Goodness.

880
00:28:45,439 --> 00:28:47,137
- you were his senior. - It was worth it.

881
00:28:47,138 --> 00:28:48,826
I thought you were older than me.

882
00:28:49,539 --> 00:28:51,708
Don't worry because...

883
00:28:51,709 --> 00:28:54,448
- these teams aren't fixed. - No, they're not.

884
00:28:54,449 --> 00:28:56,718
- That's a relief. - Let's sit down.

885
00:28:56,719 --> 00:28:59,147
Why would you tell us not to worry when no one was worried?

886
00:28:59,148 --> 00:29:02,357
Don't worry. These teams aren't fixed.

887
00:29:02,358 --> 00:29:03,817
(Current Couples: Team Gummy, Team Nucksal and Code Kunst,)

888
00:29:03,818 --> 00:29:05,203
(Team SORAN, Team Apink)

889
00:29:05,588 --> 00:29:08,427
For our fan-meet,

890
00:29:08,428 --> 00:29:10,657
we've called the best musicians...

891
00:29:10,658 --> 00:29:12,798
of this country.

892
00:29:12,799 --> 00:29:14,268
Please give a round of applause.

893
00:29:14,269 --> 00:29:15,552
(Welcome)

894
00:29:16,039 --> 00:29:17,698
I've said this numerous times,

895
00:29:17,699 --> 00:29:21,637
- but these teams aren't fixed. - Right.

896
00:29:21,638 --> 00:29:23,478
I won't say whom I'm talking about.

897
00:29:23,479 --> 00:29:27,085
But some of you are not wanted by your teammates.

898
00:29:27,148 --> 00:29:29,518
But then again, it may differ per team.

899
00:29:29,519 --> 00:29:32,617
But for me, I look forward...

900
00:29:32,618 --> 00:29:35,087
- to Gummy and Jong Kook. - Me too.

901
00:29:35,088 --> 00:29:36,688
This is my personal opinion.

902
00:29:36,689 --> 00:29:39,188
I think she's the best female singer.

903
00:29:39,189 --> 00:29:40,758
- Right. - Me too.

904
00:29:40,759 --> 00:29:44,528
Gummy's real name is Park Ji Yeon.

905
00:29:44,529 --> 00:29:46,468
- It's interesting. - Why are you saying my real name?

906
00:29:46,469 --> 00:29:47,667
I think it's a nice name.

907
00:29:47,668 --> 00:29:49,597
It is. But if you're going with Gummy,

908
00:29:49,598 --> 00:29:52,938
- Jong Kook needs to be Mosquito. - Hold on.

909
00:29:52,939 --> 00:29:54,708
- Hold on. - Gummy and Mosquito.

910
00:29:54,709 --> 00:29:57,238
I'm serious. You have to.

911
00:29:57,239 --> 00:29:58,894
- How could you say that? - Mosquito.

912
00:29:59,479 --> 00:30:02,377
It'll be Mosquito, Gummy, and Water Strider.

913
00:30:02,378 --> 00:30:03,377
They're all insects.

914
00:30:03,378 --> 00:30:05,035
- You should do that. - I like it.

915
00:30:05,078 --> 00:30:06,988
If it's with her, I can deal with that.

916
00:30:06,989 --> 00:30:09,087
- I think it's nice. - Of course.

917
00:30:09,088 --> 00:30:12,018
(You can call me Mosquito.)

918
00:30:12,289 --> 00:30:15,427
Gummy, isn't this your first appearance on our show?

919
00:30:15,428 --> 00:30:16,558
- Yes. - Yes.

920
00:30:16,559 --> 00:30:19,768
You can see who's filmed outdoor variety shows...

921
00:30:19,769 --> 00:30:23,238
- by their outfits. - Right.

922
00:30:23,239 --> 00:30:24,512
Am I not prepared?

923
00:30:25,168 --> 00:30:27,229
Apink has a lot of experience in such shows.

924
00:30:27,239 --> 00:30:29,238
They're prepared for today. On the other hand,

925
00:30:29,239 --> 00:30:32,440
I'm the most concerned about Code Kunst.

926
00:30:33,509 --> 00:30:34,607
- He's burning up. - He is...

927
00:30:34,608 --> 00:30:36,448
- He's sweating. - He looks...

928
00:30:36,449 --> 00:30:38,478
- He's sweating a lot. - He looks like a newbie.

929
00:30:38,479 --> 00:30:41,288
- Why are your shoulders so big? - He's burning up.

930
00:30:41,289 --> 00:30:42,718
(He's melting.)

931
00:30:42,719 --> 00:30:44,577
If you put a magnifying glass over his body, he'll burn up.

932
00:30:44,719 --> 00:30:48,092
- His lips are dehydrated. - A magnifying glass?

933
00:30:48,259 --> 00:30:49,698
You'll see a haze.

934
00:30:49,699 --> 00:30:52,698
Code Kunst is dressed the worst right now.

935
00:30:52,769 --> 00:30:54,067
But SORAN is also in serious trouble.

936
00:30:54,068 --> 00:30:55,698
- Look at them. - It's fall for them.

937
00:30:55,699 --> 00:30:57,438
They're wearing vests, cardigans, and knits.

938
00:30:57,439 --> 00:30:59,808
- Why are they wearing knits? - They're wearing black pants too.

939
00:30:59,809 --> 00:31:01,384
It's so hot.

940
00:31:01,539 --> 00:31:03,478
Seok Jin has been on this show...

941
00:31:03,479 --> 00:31:05,677
for a very long time, so why is he wearing a knit?

942
00:31:05,678 --> 00:31:07,478
This isn't a knit. This is a sweater.

943
00:31:07,479 --> 00:31:08,877
- Right. - This is...

944
00:31:08,878 --> 00:31:10,778
- Just ignore him. - like our team uniform.

945
00:31:10,779 --> 00:31:12,288
I don't want my arms to get tanned.

946
00:31:12,289 --> 00:31:14,874
- They're getting tanned. - He's going through puberty.

947
00:31:14,888 --> 00:31:16,958
He's sensitive, so please be careful.

948
00:31:16,959 --> 00:31:18,587
(He's a 54-year-old going through puberty.)

949
00:31:18,588 --> 00:31:21,657
First off, let me introduce Gummy.

950
00:31:21,658 --> 00:31:23,927
On February 7, 2003, she released her 1st album...

951
00:31:23,928 --> 00:31:26,555
with her song "Like Them".

952
00:31:26,668 --> 00:31:29,597
- She debuted 17 years ago. - I'm so embarrassed.

953
00:31:30,199 --> 00:31:31,938
Applaud for her.

954
00:31:31,939 --> 00:31:33,768
It's very rare to stay in the entertainment business...

955
00:31:33,769 --> 00:31:36,478
for that long without causing any problems.

956
00:31:36,479 --> 00:31:37,938
- Right. - You know that, right?

957
00:31:37,939 --> 00:31:39,808
- I've been around for too long. - I debuted 24 years ago.

958
00:31:39,809 --> 00:31:41,496
Please applaud for him.

959
00:31:41,979 --> 00:31:43,464
You'd expect him to get in trouble.

960
00:31:43,578 --> 00:31:45,147
- Seriously. - He's right.

961
00:31:45,148 --> 00:31:46,288
But he's still holding on.

962
00:31:46,289 --> 00:31:47,288
- 27 years. - What?

963
00:31:47,289 --> 00:31:49,106
- He debuted 27 years ago. - Please applaud for him.

964
00:31:49,289 --> 00:31:51,288
- His time is running out. - What?

965
00:31:51,289 --> 00:31:53,488
- He has three more years left. - His time is running out.

966
00:31:53,489 --> 00:31:55,127
- It'll be 30 years soon. - Right.

967
00:31:55,128 --> 00:31:57,058
- He debuted 29 years ago. - Your time is running out.

968
00:31:57,059 --> 00:31:58,458
Please applaud for me.

969
00:31:58,459 --> 00:31:59,768
- He debuted 29 years ago. - Please applaud for me.

970
00:31:59,769 --> 00:32:02,067
He's my senior.

971
00:32:02,068 --> 00:32:03,768
He debuted before I was born.

972
00:32:03,769 --> 00:32:06,938
These days, there are many issues in our industry.

973
00:32:06,939 --> 00:32:09,278
But she's been doing great for 17 years now.

974
00:32:09,279 --> 00:32:11,096
- Right. - It's amazing how much love...

975
00:32:11,138 --> 00:32:12,347
she still gets with her voice.

976
00:32:12,348 --> 00:32:14,398
Ji Yeon, please say a word.

977
00:32:15,178 --> 00:32:17,147
- About being scandal-free? - Yes.

978
00:32:17,148 --> 00:32:18,158
(What?)

979
00:32:18,249 --> 00:32:19,417
Right.

980
00:32:19,418 --> 00:32:21,347
This is an important question.

981
00:32:21,348 --> 00:32:22,368
It is.

982
00:32:22,489 --> 00:32:25,627
I've been realizing my fame more recently.

983
00:32:25,628 --> 00:32:27,857
I've been doing many concerts,

984
00:32:27,858 --> 00:32:30,828
and it's evident that my fans are growing.

985
00:32:31,059 --> 00:32:34,228
It makes me want to sing until the day I die.

986
00:32:34,229 --> 00:32:36,137
- Please do that for us. - Please do.

987
00:32:36,138 --> 00:32:38,167
- Seriously. - I hold concerts too.

988
00:32:38,168 --> 00:32:40,468
- I always say something at the end. - What?

989
00:32:40,469 --> 00:32:42,677
That I'll be scandal-free and sing for a long time.

990
00:32:42,678 --> 00:32:44,337
The paparazzi have given up on him.

991
00:32:44,338 --> 00:32:45,877
(No one thinks he'll cause any trouble.)

992
00:32:45,878 --> 00:32:47,161
- That's right. - Yes.

993
00:32:47,249 --> 00:32:49,577
Ji Yeon, as I have said earlier,

994
00:32:49,578 --> 00:32:51,617
I'd like to congratulate you.

995
00:32:51,618 --> 00:32:54,087
You got married.

996
00:32:54,088 --> 00:32:56,058
- Thank you. - Congratulations.

997
00:32:56,059 --> 00:32:59,558
I'm not the type to interrogate her...

998
00:32:59,559 --> 00:33:01,458
- on her marriage life. - Right.

999
00:33:01,459 --> 00:33:03,357
- I'm not like that. - I hate those kinds of people.

1000
00:33:03,358 --> 00:33:05,798
- How's your marriage life? - We're not like that.

1001
00:33:05,799 --> 00:33:09,567
(How is her married life?)

1002
00:33:09,568 --> 00:33:11,867
- You ended up asking her. - It's just one question.

1003
00:33:11,868 --> 00:33:12,968
I can ask one question.

1004
00:33:12,969 --> 00:33:15,308
One question is all right. How is your marriage life?

1005
00:33:15,309 --> 00:33:16,723
- My marriage life? - Yes.

1006
00:33:16,809 --> 00:33:19,448
I'll just say that I recommend marriage to everyone.

1007
00:33:19,449 --> 00:33:20,607
- Really? - Yes.

1008
00:33:20,608 --> 00:33:23,347
- That's a rare thing to say. - Jong Kook is single.

1009
00:33:23,348 --> 00:33:26,146
Can you explain to him why you recommend it?

1010
00:33:26,418 --> 00:33:29,317
You have someone with whom you can freely talk...

1011
00:33:29,318 --> 00:33:32,157
about your worries.

1012
00:33:32,158 --> 00:33:33,258
- They will always be on your side. - Right.

1013
00:33:33,259 --> 00:33:34,572
They will forever be your companion.

1014
00:33:34,588 --> 00:33:37,058
What do you not like about Cho Jung Seok?

1015
00:33:37,059 --> 00:33:38,728
(Seok Jin suddenly asks a question.)

1016
00:33:38,729 --> 00:33:41,498
What was that? You're such a mood wrecker.

1017
00:33:41,499 --> 00:33:42,867
- Tell us three things. - You're the worst.

1018
00:33:42,868 --> 00:33:44,468
- Tell us three things. - You're just terrible.

1019
00:33:44,469 --> 00:33:45,808
- Tell us. - Don't make her uncomfortable.

1020
00:33:45,809 --> 00:33:47,626
We don't ask that question even on "Happy Together".

1021
00:33:48,209 --> 00:33:50,407
- My goodness. - Not even on talk shows.

1022
00:33:50,408 --> 00:33:52,177
If you ask that question on a talk show these days,

1023
00:33:52,178 --> 00:33:53,693
- you'd be booed. - Of course.

1024
00:33:53,749 --> 00:33:55,869
- Ji Yeon. - Yes?

1025
00:33:55,949 --> 00:33:58,548
"Running Man" has been going on for many years,

1026
00:33:58,549 --> 00:34:00,347
but we've never done this kind of collaboration.

1027
00:34:00,348 --> 00:34:01,718
We're very curious.

1028
00:34:01,719 --> 00:34:03,476
Is there any member you want to team up with?

1029
00:34:03,888 --> 00:34:07,087
He's right next to me.

1030
00:34:07,088 --> 00:34:08,757
(Do you mean us?)

1031
00:34:08,758 --> 00:34:09,797
But...

1032
00:34:09,798 --> 00:34:11,415
you pointed to the right first and then to the left.

1033
00:34:12,629 --> 00:34:14,297
- Is that important? - All right.

1034
00:34:14,298 --> 00:34:16,137
- We're number 1 and number 2. - Okay.

1035
00:34:16,138 --> 00:34:17,412
(Let's watch what Gummy did again.)

1036
00:34:19,968 --> 00:34:21,808
(Her right hand is telling the truth...)

1037
00:34:21,809 --> 00:34:23,637
(while her left hand is just being polite.)

1038
00:34:23,638 --> 00:34:25,254
- That's right. - That's so funny.

1039
00:34:25,278 --> 00:34:27,347
Number 1 and number 2.

1040
00:34:27,348 --> 00:34:28,608
She's so nice.

1041
00:34:28,609 --> 00:34:31,375
Why do you want to team up with Jong Kook?

1042
00:34:31,749 --> 00:34:35,788
When we did a show where artists collaborated,

1043
00:34:35,789 --> 00:34:39,327
I wanted to sing with him, but I didn't get a chance.

1044
00:34:39,328 --> 00:34:42,015
Also, Haha and I have been talking about...

1045
00:34:42,059 --> 00:34:44,058
collaborating for a long time.

1046
00:34:44,059 --> 00:34:45,341
Your partner is Kwang Soo.

1047
00:34:45,399 --> 00:34:47,247
Your teammate is Kwang Soo.

1048
00:34:47,328 --> 00:34:49,137
She picked me.

1049
00:34:49,138 --> 00:34:51,795
- Are you her manager? - No.

1050
00:34:51,899 --> 00:34:53,467
Are you here to shoot "Omniscient Interfering View"?

1051
00:34:53,468 --> 00:34:54,518
No.

1052
00:34:54,809 --> 00:34:57,407
- "Omniscient Interfering View". - Send him to that show.

1053
00:34:57,408 --> 00:35:00,748
All right. Shouldn't we see Ji Yeon's performance?

1054
00:35:00,749 --> 00:35:02,091
(Shouldn't we see Gummy's performance?)

1055
00:35:02,109 --> 00:35:03,966
- It's such an honor. - It really is an honor.

1056
00:35:04,718 --> 00:35:06,047
Finally.

1057
00:35:06,048 --> 00:35:07,099
It's an honor.

1058
00:35:07,519 --> 00:35:09,818
- I can't believe I get to see this. - I love you!

1059
00:35:09,819 --> 00:35:12,487
This song isn't really when the sun is out.

1060
00:35:12,488 --> 00:35:14,288
- I'm sorry. - We'll love it!

1061
00:35:14,289 --> 00:35:15,338
Thank you.

1062
00:35:15,428 --> 00:35:16,914
- We'll love it! - I can cry.

1063
00:35:17,629 --> 00:35:19,128
(Gummy shows off her charms before the collaboration.)

1064
00:35:19,129 --> 00:35:21,047
- This song. - I love it.

1065
00:35:21,968 --> 00:35:23,998
(One of Gummy's many hit songs)

1066
00:35:23,999 --> 00:35:26,736
("You Are My Everything")

1067
00:35:27,039 --> 00:35:29,664
(The audience is already falling in love.)

1068
00:35:32,649 --> 00:35:35,148
It was you

1069
00:35:35,149 --> 00:35:39,330
From the start

1070
00:35:39,419 --> 00:35:42,447
You were the one

1071
00:35:42,448 --> 00:35:45,721
Who would come to me

1072
00:35:46,758 --> 00:35:52,252
Even with just one encounter

1073
00:35:52,459 --> 00:35:59,236
My eyes spoke

1074
00:36:00,769 --> 00:36:03,263
I hope

1075
00:36:03,278 --> 00:36:06,106
This isn't something

1076
00:36:07,809 --> 00:36:10,617
That just passes by

1077
00:36:10,618 --> 00:36:12,739
Like the wind

1078
00:36:15,348 --> 00:36:19,974
(Gummy's soft voice makes you forget the heat.)

1079
00:36:21,828 --> 00:36:24,927
(Her voice from the in-ears sounds even better.)

1080
00:36:24,928 --> 00:36:29,040
(With 17 years of experience, she is the star of stars.)

1081
00:36:29,968 --> 00:36:34,685
You are my everything

1082
00:36:35,439 --> 00:36:40,802
Our fate pours down like the rain

1083
00:36:43,519 --> 00:36:46,317
(I can't believe she is on our team.)

1084
00:36:46,749 --> 00:36:48,818
Inside

1085
00:36:48,819 --> 00:36:53,233
My stopped heart

1086
00:36:53,988 --> 00:36:58,797
There is only one love

1087
00:36:58,798 --> 00:37:03,384
You are my everything

1088
00:37:03,598 --> 00:37:05,053
- Oh, my. - That was amazing.

1089
00:37:05,539 --> 00:37:06,568
Gummy!

1090
00:37:06,569 --> 00:37:07,867
(Her song was honey to the ears.)

1091
00:37:07,868 --> 00:37:09,828
Can I switch to Gummy's team?

1092
00:37:10,379 --> 00:37:12,777
- That was amazing. - Please sing one more song!

1093
00:37:12,778 --> 00:37:15,779
- Encore! - Encore!

1094
00:37:15,809 --> 00:37:18,117
Can you sing one more song? That was incredible.

1095
00:37:18,118 --> 00:37:20,918
I didn't expect you to ask for an encore.

1096
00:37:20,919 --> 00:37:22,362
Let me sing one more song then.

1097
00:37:23,089 --> 00:37:24,717
I'll sing "Childish Adult".

1098
00:37:24,718 --> 00:37:26,558
("Childish Adult" by Gummy)

1099
00:37:26,559 --> 00:37:28,174
- Please sing with me. - Are you going to dance?

1100
00:37:29,328 --> 00:37:31,058
(The audience is already excited.)

1101
00:37:31,059 --> 00:37:33,320
(Get ready to have fun.)

1102
00:37:33,428 --> 00:37:36,974
(Here we go.)

1103
00:37:37,499 --> 00:37:41,246
(Soulful)

1104
00:37:41,939 --> 00:37:43,237
(This is so fun.)

1105
00:37:43,238 --> 00:37:44,451
She's amazing.

1106
00:37:44,908 --> 00:37:46,495
(Look at So Min.)

1107
00:37:46,809 --> 00:37:48,596
(Dancing)

1108
00:37:48,908 --> 00:37:51,171
(She's trying to look sexy.)

1109
00:37:52,319 --> 00:37:54,873
(The soul groove begins.)

1110
00:37:56,089 --> 00:37:59,089
(This is what a groove means.)

1111
00:38:00,028 --> 00:38:02,757
(Dancing)

1112
00:38:02,758 --> 00:38:03,940
She's amazing.

1113
00:38:04,198 --> 00:38:06,319
- This is so classy. - She's fantastic.

1114
00:38:06,399 --> 00:38:09,097
("Running Man" has never been this classy.)

1115
00:38:09,098 --> 00:38:10,168
Make some noise!

1116
00:38:10,169 --> 00:38:12,017
(Gummy is the best.)

1117
00:38:12,339 --> 00:38:14,429
(The audience explodes with excitement.)

1118
00:38:14,809 --> 00:38:17,566
(Everyone copies Gummy's dance.)

1119
00:38:18,339 --> 00:38:19,407
Nice!

1120
00:38:19,408 --> 00:38:22,005
(Like this?)

1121
00:38:23,819 --> 00:38:27,424
(She finishes up with a fantastic vibrato.)

1122
00:38:30,919 --> 00:38:31,999
Thank you.

1123
00:38:32,289 --> 00:38:34,783
(Standing ovation)

1124
00:38:37,028 --> 00:38:38,413
This dance is so attractive.

1125
00:38:39,059 --> 00:38:40,412
That was amazing.

1126
00:38:40,899 --> 00:38:42,998
Everyone, give a big hand to Ji Yeon!

1127
00:38:42,999 --> 00:38:44,268
(The RnB queen gave a superb performance.)

1128
00:38:44,269 --> 00:38:46,907
(Praise Gummy!)

1129
00:38:46,908 --> 00:38:48,222
That was so classy.

1130
00:38:48,309 --> 00:38:49,895
- So classy. - I loved the dance.

1131
00:38:50,278 --> 00:38:52,096
She didn't move her hips too much.

1132
00:38:52,138 --> 00:38:54,027
- What are you doing? - Just a little bit.

1133
00:38:54,109 --> 00:38:56,378
Like this.

1134
00:38:56,379 --> 00:38:57,691
I loved it.

1135
00:38:57,778 --> 00:38:59,232
You shouldn't move your hips too much.

1136
00:39:00,149 --> 00:39:01,300
- Jae Seok. - Yes?

1137
00:39:01,589 --> 00:39:02,729
It's burning.

1138
00:39:02,919 --> 00:39:04,217
Seriously...

1139
00:39:04,218 --> 00:39:06,815
- It smells like burning pork belly. - Yes. It does.

1140
00:39:06,859 --> 00:39:08,527
There's a burning smell.

1141
00:39:08,528 --> 00:39:10,427
- The leather is burning. - What are you wearing underneath?

1142
00:39:10,428 --> 00:39:12,247
- Can't you take the jacket off? - Okay.

1143
00:39:12,499 --> 00:39:14,068
- You can take it off. - Take it off.

1144
00:39:14,069 --> 00:39:16,398
This is the first time I've left home since spring.

1145
00:39:16,399 --> 00:39:19,165
(This is the first time I've left home since spring.)

1146
00:39:19,609 --> 00:39:20,668
You haven't left home?

1147
00:39:20,669 --> 00:39:22,007
(Code Kunst, been home for three months)

1148
00:39:22,008 --> 00:39:24,635
- Since spring? - Look at the color of his skin.

1149
00:39:25,138 --> 00:39:26,624
We rarely go outside.

1150
00:39:26,678 --> 00:39:28,047
- You don't go outside a lot? - No.

1151
00:39:28,048 --> 00:39:29,447
Unless we have a performance...

1152
00:39:29,448 --> 00:39:32,617
- And you perform in the evening. - Exactly.

1153
00:39:32,618 --> 00:39:35,012
In the hip-hop scene,

1154
00:39:35,089 --> 00:39:37,657
these two became a phenomenon.

1155
00:39:37,658 --> 00:39:39,927
They're writing history right now.

1156
00:39:39,928 --> 00:39:40,987
(They are talented hip-hop artists.)

1157
00:39:40,988 --> 00:39:42,157
Please introduce yourselves.

1158
00:39:42,158 --> 00:39:44,956
Hello. I'm Code Kunst of AOMG.

1159
00:39:45,198 --> 00:39:46,498
Also,

1160
00:39:46,499 --> 00:39:50,105
on hip-hop audition shows, he is the most sought-after...

1161
00:39:50,368 --> 00:39:51,955
mentor right now.

1162
00:39:52,098 --> 00:39:53,725
- He has so many hit songs. - He's so popular.

1163
00:39:53,908 --> 00:39:55,626
But Nucksal is just as popular as Code Kunst.

1164
00:39:56,008 --> 00:39:58,130
As you all know, "Cut Cut Cut"...

1165
00:39:58,479 --> 00:40:01,811
How would you describe the relationship between you two?

1166
00:40:02,078 --> 00:40:06,088
We met when we had almost no money.

1167
00:40:06,089 --> 00:40:09,148
We were 27 and making music without earning much money.

1168
00:40:09,459 --> 00:40:12,185
Since then, we've been working together.

1169
00:40:12,589 --> 00:40:15,557
You two have been best friends, right?

1170
00:40:15,859 --> 00:40:17,197
- I guess? - Are you best friends?

1171
00:40:17,198 --> 00:40:19,249
I overheard their conversation.

1172
00:40:19,629 --> 00:40:21,797
They're nothing more than business partners.

1173
00:40:21,798 --> 00:40:23,367
(They're nothing more than business partners.)

1174
00:40:23,368 --> 00:40:24,538
- Really? - Yes.

1175
00:40:24,539 --> 00:40:27,467
- Friends can do business too. - Of course.

1176
00:40:27,468 --> 00:40:29,863
We just have a different style of friendship.

1177
00:40:29,939 --> 00:40:32,261
- A "different style of friendship". - Keeping a beautiful distance.

1178
00:40:32,609 --> 00:40:35,907
You're close to Nucksal too, but who are you closest to?

1179
00:40:35,908 --> 00:40:38,547
- Woo Won Jae. - Won Jae.

1180
00:40:38,548 --> 00:40:40,771
- What about you, Nucksal? - I'm closest to Code Kunst.

1181
00:40:41,649 --> 00:40:42,858
What about you, Nucksal?

1182
00:40:42,859 --> 00:40:45,088
(He didn't think for a second.)

1183
00:40:45,089 --> 00:40:46,157
(It's a one-way friendship.)

1184
00:40:46,158 --> 00:40:47,188
You must feel hurt.

1185
00:40:47,189 --> 00:40:48,541
- It's a bit... - I...

1186
00:40:48,658 --> 00:40:50,012
It can happen.

1187
00:40:50,258 --> 00:40:52,551
- He can be closest to someone else. - They're so funny.

1188
00:40:53,229 --> 00:40:56,338
Do you have a nickname, Code Kunst?

1189
00:40:56,339 --> 00:40:58,318
- You look a bit like Kwang Soo. - Really?

1190
00:40:58,439 --> 00:40:59,967
- He looks a bit like Kwang Soo. - A little.

1191
00:40:59,968 --> 00:41:01,726
How did you feel when you heard that?

1192
00:41:01,809 --> 00:41:04,478
My mom often says I look like Kwang Soo.

1193
00:41:04,479 --> 00:41:05,777
- Your mom? - Your mom?

1194
00:41:05,778 --> 00:41:07,728
His mom must like you.

1195
00:41:07,848 --> 00:41:10,248
Did your mom feel proud?

1196
00:41:10,249 --> 00:41:11,793
I felt...

1197
00:41:12,178 --> 00:41:14,018
a bit offended at that time.

1198
00:41:14,019 --> 00:41:17,352
(I felt a bit offended.)

1199
00:41:18,089 --> 00:41:20,458
(Mom, how could you say that?)

1200
00:41:20,459 --> 00:41:21,628
His mom...

1201
00:41:21,629 --> 00:41:23,345
Does he have to be that honest?

1202
00:41:23,598 --> 00:41:26,830
But my mom told me that I shouldn't feel offended.

1203
00:41:26,899 --> 00:41:28,110
She made that clear to me.

1204
00:41:28,169 --> 00:41:30,068
- She corrected me. - His mom said that.

1205
00:41:30,069 --> 00:41:32,059
Why would he say that in such an angry voice?

1206
00:41:32,669 --> 00:41:34,153
It's just the way he speaks.

1207
00:41:34,539 --> 00:41:37,204
- Code Kunst is very polite. - All right.

1208
00:41:37,709 --> 00:41:39,799
I'll ask you the same question I asked Ji Yeon earlier.

1209
00:41:39,979 --> 00:41:41,927
Which member do you not want on your team?

1210
00:41:42,278 --> 00:41:43,430
To be honest,

1211
00:41:44,048 --> 00:41:45,897
- I don't want So Min on my team. - Why not?

1212
00:41:46,149 --> 00:41:47,648
On Running Man,

1213
00:41:47,649 --> 00:41:50,157
she's often clumsy.

1214
00:41:50,158 --> 00:41:52,987
She's incredibly clumsy.

1215
00:41:53,059 --> 00:41:54,241
Look at her right now.

1216
00:41:54,758 --> 00:41:56,981
(Awkward)

1217
00:41:57,098 --> 00:41:58,815
Look how awkward her gestures are.

1218
00:41:58,859 --> 00:42:00,586
That's... Look.

1219
00:42:01,399 --> 00:42:03,168
(Clumsy)

1220
00:42:03,169 --> 00:42:05,568
- This... - I know what it is.

1221
00:42:05,569 --> 00:42:07,967
Her upper body and lower body are out of sync.

1222
00:42:07,968 --> 00:42:09,268
I know what you mean.

1223
00:42:09,269 --> 00:42:13,047
- She wants to enjoy hip-hop music, - Exactly.

1224
00:42:13,048 --> 00:42:14,677
- but she can't express it well. - Actually,

1225
00:42:14,678 --> 00:42:16,770
I'm sorry to say this, but Ji Hyo will drive you crazy.

1226
00:42:18,249 --> 00:42:20,248
(Be prepared.)

1227
00:42:20,249 --> 00:42:22,318
- When you see Ji Hyo later... - She's the worst.

1228
00:42:22,319 --> 00:42:23,757
- She's terrible. - Show them.

1229
00:42:23,758 --> 00:42:24,818
No!

1230
00:42:24,819 --> 00:42:26,018
(Stiff)

1231
00:42:26,019 --> 00:42:27,069
Stop!

1232
00:42:28,488 --> 00:42:29,597
(I wish I didn't see that.)

1233
00:42:29,598 --> 00:42:30,810
Stop!

1234
00:42:31,229 --> 00:42:32,672
- No! - Stop!

1235
00:42:32,828 --> 00:42:34,415
Every single joint moves on its own.

1236
00:42:35,229 --> 00:42:36,697
- But she doesn't have to move. - It might be a good thing.

1237
00:42:36,698 --> 00:42:38,416
- It might be a good thing. - What do you mean?

1238
00:42:38,499 --> 00:42:40,108
She asked if his name was Code Concert.

1239
00:42:40,109 --> 00:42:41,886
(She asked if his name was Code Concert.)

1240
00:42:41,968 --> 00:42:44,378
She thought his name was Code Concert.

1241
00:42:44,379 --> 00:42:45,808
It's not Code Concert.

1242
00:42:45,809 --> 00:42:46,919
(So Min didn't even know his name.)

1243
00:42:47,008 --> 00:42:48,766
(When they just started interviewing Code Kunst...)

1244
00:42:49,278 --> 00:42:51,601
(Code Concert?)

1245
00:42:52,118 --> 00:42:54,442
(What's his name?)

1246
00:42:54,448 --> 00:42:57,286
(It's Code Kunst.)

1247
00:42:57,319 --> 00:42:59,208
(I thought it was Code Concert.)

1248
00:42:59,258 --> 00:43:02,228
(Kunst, not Concert.)

1249
00:43:02,229 --> 00:43:03,697
- She thought it was Concert. - It's not Code Concert.

1250
00:43:03,698 --> 00:43:04,839
I'm relieved she didn't say, "Code Consent".

1251
00:43:04,999 --> 00:43:06,597
- It's not Code Concert. - She could have said, "Consent".

1252
00:43:06,598 --> 00:43:09,097
- I'm sorry. - Most people know his name.

1253
00:43:09,098 --> 00:43:10,281
She thought it was Code Concert.

1254
00:43:10,839 --> 00:43:14,208
Now let's see Code Kunst and Nucksal's performance!

1255
00:43:14,209 --> 00:43:16,808
(Code Kunst and Nucksal's hip-hop stage)

1256
00:43:16,809 --> 00:43:18,308
(Excited)

1257
00:43:18,309 --> 00:43:19,662
I love hip-hop.

1258
00:43:19,749 --> 00:43:21,163
I wanted to see it in real life.

1259
00:43:21,908 --> 00:43:23,047
This is not good.

1260
00:43:23,048 --> 00:43:24,563
(Code Kunst plays the keyboard.)

1261
00:43:24,948 --> 00:43:26,059
He's playing the keyboard.

1262
00:43:26,718 --> 00:43:28,738
Let's hear Code Kunst...

1263
00:43:29,189 --> 00:43:30,936
play the keyboard for a moment.

1264
00:43:31,419 --> 00:43:33,628
- Amazing. - It's a live performance!

1265
00:43:33,629 --> 00:43:36,325
(Full of swag)

1266
00:43:36,859 --> 00:43:38,157
He looks different.

1267
00:43:38,158 --> 00:43:39,597
He looks totally different.

1268
00:43:39,598 --> 00:43:40,967
(How will the nation's best hip-hop artists perform?)

1269
00:43:40,968 --> 00:43:42,141
This is so cool.

1270
00:43:43,238 --> 00:43:47,077
("Perfume" by Code Kunst, featuring Nucksal)

1271
00:44:11,528 --> 00:44:13,821
(They become soulful.)

1272
00:44:16,439 --> 00:44:19,095
(Nucksal's vibe lives up to his reputation.)

1273
00:44:19,098 --> 00:44:20,926
(This is fun.)

(This is crazy.)

1276
00:44:40,488 --> 00:44:42,358
I can hear the lyrics clearly.

1277
00:44:42,359 --> 00:44:43,711
(I can hear the lyrics clearly.)

1278
00:44:44,698 --> 00:44:48,305
(The song Code Kunst produced meets Nucksal's flow.)

1279
00:44:48,569 --> 00:44:52,377
(The performance captivates the audience in no time.)

1280
00:44:52,569 --> 00:44:54,367
(Good vibe, good performance)

1281
00:44:54,368 --> 00:44:57,267
(This is what Code Kunst and Nucksal can do.)

1282
00:44:57,809 --> 00:44:59,051
I could hear the lyrics clearly.

1283
00:44:59,439 --> 00:45:00,762
It was nice.

1284
00:45:00,879 --> 00:45:03,172
- It was an honor. - They are cool.

1285
00:45:04,319 --> 00:45:07,046
- They are cool. - I wish I could hear "One over N".

1286
00:45:07,218 --> 00:45:09,117
(Even the layman in hip-hop gives them a thumbs up.)

1287
00:45:09,118 --> 00:45:11,987
The next guests are...

1288
00:45:11,988 --> 00:45:14,657
Apink and SORAN.

1289
00:45:14,658 --> 00:45:16,498
(The popular girl group, Apink and the indie band, SORAN)

1290
00:45:16,499 --> 00:45:18,558
Let's start with SORAN.

1291
00:45:18,559 --> 00:45:20,027
SORAN.

1292
00:45:20,028 --> 00:45:23,467
Young Bae, you have starred in many TV shows...

1293
00:45:23,468 --> 00:45:26,168
and radio shows.

1294
00:45:26,169 --> 00:45:30,878
However, it's rare to have the entire band on the show.

1295
00:45:30,879 --> 00:45:32,907
- It's the first time. - Please, say hello.

1296
00:45:32,908 --> 00:45:35,108
I am the vocalist of SORAN, Ko Young Bae.

1297
00:45:35,109 --> 00:45:37,177
I am the bassist, Seo Myun Ho.

1298
00:45:37,178 --> 00:45:38,461
I am the guitarist, Lee Tae Wook.

1299
00:45:38,979 --> 00:45:40,918
I am the drummer, Pyeon Yu Il.

1300
00:45:40,919 --> 00:45:42,101
Pyeon Yu Il.

1301
00:45:42,649 --> 00:45:43,918
(The members of SORAN, welcome.)

1302
00:45:43,919 --> 00:45:46,040
Pyeon Yu Il.

1303
00:45:46,359 --> 00:45:48,379
Yul Il, I don't know how this will sound,

1304
00:45:48,758 --> 00:45:49,940
but...

1305
00:45:50,598 --> 00:45:52,850
you are quite ordinary.

1306
00:45:53,269 --> 00:45:55,450
(You are quite ordinary.)

1307
00:45:55,468 --> 00:45:56,751
Seriously.

1308
00:45:56,798 --> 00:45:59,097
You look like a man...

1309
00:45:59,098 --> 00:46:01,308
I would pass by on the street.

1310
00:46:01,309 --> 00:46:03,038
- That's right. - You seem ordinary...

1311
00:46:03,039 --> 00:46:04,277
and relaxed.

1312
00:46:04,278 --> 00:46:07,208
- There is a celebrity I resemble. - Who would that be?

1313
00:46:07,209 --> 00:46:09,947
He is very famous these days.

1314
00:46:09,948 --> 00:46:11,518
- And who's that? - It's Ryu Hyun Jin.

1315
00:46:11,519 --> 00:46:13,648
- Ryu Hyun Jin. - He is right.

1316
00:46:13,649 --> 00:46:14,887
(The Korean monster, Ryu Hyun Jin)

1317
00:46:14,888 --> 00:46:16,987
- I see the resemblance. - I see the resemblance.

1318
00:46:16,988 --> 00:46:19,139
- I see it. - That's right.

1319
00:46:19,658 --> 00:46:20,657
I see it.

1320
00:46:20,658 --> 00:46:22,228
I am sorry, but did you prepare that comment?

1321
00:46:22,229 --> 00:46:24,027
Your answer was unrelated to my question.

1322
00:46:24,028 --> 00:46:26,128
- Seriously. - I said you look ordinary,

1323
00:46:26,129 --> 00:46:28,068
- but you brought up Ryu Hyun Jin. - I said what came to my mind.

1324
00:46:28,069 --> 00:46:29,728
I see.

1325
00:46:29,729 --> 00:46:31,314
Ryu Hyun Jin is too extraordinary.

1326
00:46:32,098 --> 00:46:36,108
I heard that you have met So Min before.

1327
00:46:36,109 --> 00:46:38,407
- That's right. - I once worked as a festival lady.

1328
00:46:38,408 --> 00:46:39,608
That's when...

1329
00:46:39,609 --> 00:46:41,248
- Young Bae helped me. - Really?

1330
00:46:41,249 --> 00:46:43,577
She sang a duet with me on the stage.

1331
00:46:43,578 --> 00:46:45,248
- I sang a duet. - Really?

1332
00:46:45,249 --> 00:46:49,905
(In 2014, SORAN performed with So Min at a music festival.)

1333
00:46:51,488 --> 00:46:56,088
(Young Bae stayed by So Min's side since she wasn't used to the stage.)

1334
00:46:56,089 --> 00:46:58,956
(She kept her eyes on Young Bae and depended on him.)

1335
00:47:00,828 --> 00:47:04,303
(Thank you, Young Bae.)

1336
00:47:05,839 --> 00:47:07,867
How was your performance with So Min?

1337
00:47:07,868 --> 00:47:10,177
So Min has many bad habits...

1338
00:47:10,178 --> 00:47:11,794
as a vocalist.

1339
00:47:12,039 --> 00:47:13,208
What bad habits?

1340
00:47:13,209 --> 00:47:15,777
That's good. That's what we need to hear.

1341
00:47:15,778 --> 00:47:18,547
We need to know these things before we take the stage.

1342
00:47:18,548 --> 00:47:20,818
I thought he would compliment her.

1343
00:47:20,819 --> 00:47:22,248
Most people would compliment her in this situation.

1344
00:47:22,249 --> 00:47:23,257
(Did So Min do that badly?)

1345
00:47:23,258 --> 00:47:25,358
She tries to show off despite the lack of skills.

1346
00:47:25,359 --> 00:47:26,418
You are spot on.

1347
00:47:26,419 --> 00:47:28,781
(She tries to show off despite the lack of skills.)

1348
00:47:29,289 --> 00:47:31,016
- You know what I mean, right? - You are spot on.

1349
00:47:31,629 --> 00:47:34,498
You are spot on. You saw her move her hands, right?

1350
00:47:34,499 --> 00:47:36,821
Although she doesn't have any skills,

1351
00:47:37,298 --> 00:47:39,668
- she tries to feel the music. - That's right.

1352
00:47:39,669 --> 00:47:41,068
Her performance gets ahead of her.

1353
00:47:41,069 --> 00:47:42,708
- She prepares many comments. - Comments.

1354
00:47:42,709 --> 00:47:46,338
How did you feel about Young Bae back in the days?

1355
00:47:46,339 --> 00:47:48,748
Young Bae was known...

1356
00:47:48,749 --> 00:47:50,132
as Lee Byung Hun of Hongdae.

1357
00:47:50,548 --> 00:47:52,478
He resembles Lee Byung Hun a lot.

1358
00:47:52,479 --> 00:47:54,748
- Excuse me? - He resembles Lee Byung Hun a lot.

1359
00:47:54,749 --> 00:47:56,188
(Hold on.)

1360
00:47:56,189 --> 00:47:58,558
- I am serious. - I thought he was Pyo In Bong.

1361
00:47:58,559 --> 00:47:59,901
- I am serious. - Come on.

1362
00:48:00,459 --> 00:48:03,115
(I thought he was Pyo In Bong.)

1363
00:48:03,258 --> 00:48:04,927
- Haha. - Come on.

1364
00:48:04,928 --> 00:48:06,458
Watch your words.

1365
00:48:06,459 --> 00:48:07,797
We are meeting for the first time.

1366
00:48:07,798 --> 00:48:09,827
Stop it. Stop it.

1367
00:48:09,828 --> 00:48:11,455
We could form Tin Tin Five.

1368
00:48:11,539 --> 00:48:13,487
- No! - Tin Tin Five.

1369
00:48:13,569 --> 00:48:16,296
(They could use this opportunity to form Tin Tin Five.)

1370
00:48:16,339 --> 00:48:19,378
(Look forward to the 2019 version of Tin Tin Five.)

1371
00:48:19,379 --> 00:48:20,507
Nucksal could be Kim Kyung Shik.

1372
00:48:20,508 --> 00:48:22,731
We want to ask SORAN...

1373
00:48:22,749 --> 00:48:25,018
the same question we asked other teams.

1374
00:48:25,019 --> 00:48:27,039
Is there a member you want to work with?

1375
00:48:27,149 --> 00:48:28,633
As for me,

1376
00:48:29,189 --> 00:48:31,588
I want to work with Ji Hyo.

1377
00:48:31,589 --> 00:48:32,987
- Why do you want to work with her? - Why?

1378
00:48:32,988 --> 00:48:34,358
You haven't heard her sing.

1379
00:48:34,359 --> 00:48:35,671
- That's right. - I can sing well.

1380
00:48:36,289 --> 00:48:38,823
(Why did you pick Ji Hyo?)

1381
00:48:39,298 --> 00:48:41,621
- Think about it. - I can sing well.

1382
00:48:42,269 --> 00:48:43,398
Stop it.

1383
00:48:43,399 --> 00:48:45,288
I have watched her.

1384
00:48:45,468 --> 00:48:46,907
- You will be surprised. - I think...

1385
00:48:46,908 --> 00:48:49,907
Ji Hyo's tone of voice...

1386
00:48:49,908 --> 00:48:51,237
is very charming.

1387
00:48:51,238 --> 00:48:52,608
She has a baritone voice.

1388
00:48:52,609 --> 00:48:54,447
Ji Hyo, please sing a bit.

1389
00:48:54,448 --> 00:48:56,296
- Keep it short. - That's right. Go ahead.

1390
00:48:56,578 --> 00:48:58,777
- What should I sing? - It can be anything.

1391
00:48:58,778 --> 00:49:00,364
Sing one you're confident at.

1392
00:49:00,758 --> 00:49:02,842
- It can be anything. - Sing one you're confident at.

1393
00:49:03,531 --> 00:49:05,769
I loved you too much

1394
00:49:05,770 --> 00:49:07,269
(My goodness.)

1395
00:49:07,270 --> 00:49:09,058
Why did you sigh?

1396
00:49:10,190 --> 00:49:12,219
- What do you think, Yu Il? - Why did you sigh?

1397
00:49:12,220 --> 00:49:14,219
I will play the drums to her beat.

1398
00:49:14,220 --> 00:49:15,890
- I can do it. - My goodness.

1399
00:49:15,891 --> 00:49:17,129
He is kind.

1400
00:49:17,130 --> 00:49:19,759
- He is nice. - He sighed so loudly when I sang.

1401
00:49:19,760 --> 00:49:21,230
Seok Jin, what is your problem?

1402
00:49:21,231 --> 00:49:23,129
She made the atmosphere depressing in this heat.

1403
00:49:23,130 --> 00:49:26,332
(She made the atmosphere depressing in this heat.)

1404
00:49:26,701 --> 00:49:28,559
(For goodness' sake.)

1405
00:49:28,811 --> 00:49:30,140
I loved you too much

1406
00:49:30,141 --> 00:49:31,239
She should have sung that way.

1407
00:49:31,240 --> 00:49:33,710
I watched TV

1408
00:49:33,711 --> 00:49:35,266
(She shouldn't have stretched the note.)

1409
00:49:35,451 --> 00:49:38,450
Let's give SORAN a round of applause.

1410
00:49:38,451 --> 00:49:40,037
(It's time for SORAN's performance.)

1411
00:49:40,050 --> 00:49:41,549
Let's go SORAN.

1412
00:49:41,550 --> 00:49:43,541
(Everyone is excited.)

1413
00:49:43,751 --> 00:49:45,259
You guys are awesome.

1414
00:49:45,260 --> 00:49:46,460
Give them a round of applause.

1415
00:49:46,461 --> 00:49:47,819
SORAN!

1416
00:49:47,820 --> 00:49:49,709
(How will SORAN's performance be?)

1417
00:49:49,860 --> 00:49:54,344
("Don't Lose Weight" by SORAN)

1418
00:50:05,181 --> 00:50:10,867
(The melodious sound fills the area.)

1419
00:50:18,990 --> 00:50:21,515
(1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 4.)

1420
00:50:21,530 --> 00:50:23,915
(The atmosphere turns 180 degrees.)

1421
00:50:24,431 --> 00:50:25,441
Let's go.

1422
00:50:25,661 --> 00:50:27,529
Running Man, make some noise!

1423
00:50:27,530 --> 00:50:29,691
(Screaming)

1424
00:50:30,170 --> 00:50:31,958
(She can't contain herself.)

1425
00:50:32,900 --> 00:50:34,640
(I was like that)

1426
00:50:34,641 --> 00:50:39,731
Then I met So Min

1427
00:50:40,340 --> 00:50:42,049
(I am embarrassed.)

1428
00:50:42,050 --> 00:50:44,374
(He added my name to the lyrics.)

1429
00:50:45,720 --> 00:50:48,317
(She shows him a heart.)

1430
00:50:49,150 --> 00:50:50,938
(Gosh, what is she doing?)

1431
00:50:50,990 --> 00:50:52,660
(What an eyesore!)

1432
00:50:52,661 --> 00:50:54,337
(I am sorry.)

1433
00:50:55,431 --> 00:50:59,440
(SORAN captivates women's hearts and sings love to the ears.)

1434
00:50:59,561 --> 00:51:03,570
(They have the unique vocal and harmonious band sound.)

1435
00:51:03,670 --> 00:51:06,498
(Anything is good with SORAN.)

1436
00:51:06,900 --> 00:51:08,627
(I love it!)

1437
00:51:08,940 --> 00:51:10,426
(Look at her.)

1438
00:51:10,610 --> 00:51:13,439
(The bass, guitar, drum, and vocal)

1439
00:51:13,541 --> 00:51:17,317
(The ensemble is uniquely SORAN.)

1440
00:51:18,110 --> 00:51:20,219
(SORAN never disappoints.)

1441
00:51:20,220 --> 00:51:22,819
- Thank you. - Give them a round of applause.

1442
00:51:22,820 --> 00:51:24,219
- They are the best. - Thank you.

1443
00:51:24,220 --> 00:51:25,890
The band, SORAN...

1444
00:51:25,891 --> 00:51:28,759
and girlfriend of one of the members,

1445
00:51:28,760 --> 00:51:30,060
So Min.

1446
00:51:30,061 --> 00:51:31,129
(Good work.)

1447
00:51:31,130 --> 00:51:33,484
- She made a heart. - Seriously.

1448
00:51:34,461 --> 00:51:36,692
That was too much.

1449
00:51:37,030 --> 00:51:39,100
- They are so cool. - They are so cool.

1450
00:51:39,101 --> 00:51:40,500
It was great to check out...

1451
00:51:40,501 --> 00:51:42,169
their performance outside on a hot day.

1452
00:51:42,170 --> 00:51:43,540
- Seriously. - They heated up the atmosphere.

1453
00:51:43,541 --> 00:51:45,279
Like I said before, recruiting the four teams...

1454
00:51:45,280 --> 00:51:47,140
- takes a lot of money. - That's right.

1455
00:51:47,141 --> 00:51:48,191
Do you have money?

1456
00:51:49,981 --> 00:51:51,365
Do you think I don't have money?

1457
00:51:51,981 --> 00:51:53,219
Do you think I don't have money?

1458
00:51:53,220 --> 00:51:54,680
- What? - "Do you think I don't have money?"

1459
00:51:54,681 --> 00:51:56,205
- Do I look like a beggar? - I just mean...

1460
00:51:56,291 --> 00:51:58,319
you should be thankful...

1461
00:51:58,320 --> 00:51:59,489
- for the performances. - I know.

1462
00:51:59,490 --> 00:52:01,689
- It's an honor. - It's hard to recruit all of them.

1463
00:52:01,690 --> 00:52:03,460
- I know. I know. - Seriously.

1464
00:52:03,461 --> 00:52:06,430
Please give SORAN a round of applause.

1465
00:52:06,431 --> 00:52:08,330
(SORAN's performance with a full band sound ends.)

1466
00:52:08,331 --> 00:52:10,730
It's time for Apink.

1467
00:52:10,731 --> 00:52:12,939
(The girl group with 8 years of experiences, Apink)

1468
00:52:12,940 --> 00:52:14,284
Apink!

1469
00:52:14,470 --> 00:52:16,469
They visited Running Man as a group six months ago.

1470
00:52:16,470 --> 00:52:18,169
- That's right. - They are part of the family.

1471
00:52:18,170 --> 00:52:20,879
- That's right. - Eun Ji, you sang earlier, right?

1472
00:52:20,880 --> 00:52:22,910
- Yes. - I was so startled.

1473
00:52:22,911 --> 00:52:23,950
- Thank you. - I imagined...

1474
00:52:23,951 --> 00:52:26,020
a singer in her 50s.

1475
00:52:26,021 --> 00:52:27,950
- A seasoned singer. - I wanted you to imagine me...

1476
00:52:27,951 --> 00:52:29,750
- as Kim Yon Ja. - You sounded like her.

1477
00:52:29,751 --> 00:52:31,049
- Really? - Yes.

1478
00:52:31,050 --> 00:52:32,660
- Thank you. - Eun Ji is an incredible singer.

1479
00:52:32,661 --> 00:52:35,330
How long has it been since Apink debuted?

1480
00:52:35,331 --> 00:52:37,380
It has been eight years.

1481
00:52:37,590 --> 00:52:39,299
They are a long-running group.

1482
00:52:39,300 --> 00:52:41,330
Give them a round of applause.

1483
00:52:41,331 --> 00:52:42,442
All right.

1484
00:52:43,030 --> 00:52:45,239
- You know the Seven Year Jinx. - Yes.

1485
00:52:45,240 --> 00:52:47,100
Apink overcame it.

1486
00:52:47,101 --> 00:52:49,739
- It's quite a feat. - That's right.

1487
00:52:49,740 --> 00:52:52,080
There are people who think they are the best...

1488
00:52:52,081 --> 00:52:53,310
and want to work alone.

1489
00:52:53,311 --> 00:52:54,910
- That's right. - You left that way in two months.

1490
00:52:54,911 --> 00:52:56,310
- What? - It's true.

1491
00:52:56,311 --> 00:52:57,580
- It's true. - Yes.

1492
00:52:57,581 --> 00:52:59,750
- Who did that? - Seok Jin was in my agency.

1493
00:52:59,751 --> 00:53:01,568
Then he left in three months.

1494
00:53:01,820 --> 00:53:05,020
I did calculations and learned that I was losing too much money.

1495
00:53:05,021 --> 00:53:07,460
(I did calculations and learned that I was losing too much money.)

1496
00:53:07,461 --> 00:53:09,330
(He did calculations and decided to leave.)

1497
00:53:09,331 --> 00:53:10,960
- That's why I left. - For goodness' sake.

1498
00:53:10,961 --> 00:53:12,730
It's funny because it suits him.

1499
00:53:12,731 --> 00:53:15,024
- That's hilarious. - I respect him.

1500
00:53:15,470 --> 00:53:18,228
It's funny that the agency let him go without any regrets.

1501
00:53:18,701 --> 00:53:21,540
He became known as a troublemaker in the industry.

1502
00:53:21,541 --> 00:53:23,270
He really is a troublemaker.

1503
00:53:23,271 --> 00:53:25,310
Yes, he is a troublemaker.

1504
00:53:25,311 --> 00:53:28,715
Son Na Eun of Apink.

1505
00:53:29,311 --> 00:53:31,549
Na Eun, you filmed a commercial with Jong Kook.

1506
00:53:31,550 --> 00:53:33,180
- It's often on TV. - I see it very often.

1507
00:53:33,181 --> 00:53:34,350
- Yes. - It's about a diet.

1508
00:53:34,351 --> 00:53:36,850
Don't you keep in touch with Jong Kook?

1509
00:53:36,851 --> 00:53:38,319
- We text from time to time. - Yes.

1510
00:53:38,320 --> 00:53:39,819
He said he is going to LA.

1511
00:53:39,820 --> 00:53:41,306
"He said he is going to LA."

1512
00:53:41,391 --> 00:53:42,660
He loves LA.

1513
00:53:42,661 --> 00:53:45,129
People always see Jong Kook in LA.

1514
00:53:45,130 --> 00:53:46,500
A gym or LA.

1515
00:53:46,501 --> 00:53:48,600
A friend of mine went to LA on a trip.

1516
00:53:48,601 --> 00:53:50,621
He called me and asked,

1517
00:53:50,871 --> 00:53:54,100
"Does Jong Kook have a girlfriend in LA?"

1518
00:53:54,101 --> 00:53:55,109
- Really? - I asked, "Why?"

1519
00:53:55,110 --> 00:53:58,839
He said, "Everyone here says Jong Kook visits too often."

1520
00:53:58,840 --> 00:54:00,640
- "He must have a girlfriend here." - It must be...

1521
00:54:00,641 --> 00:54:02,910
because his daughter is having a summer break.

1522
00:54:02,911 --> 00:54:06,020
(Haha corrects the rumor.)

1523
00:54:06,021 --> 00:54:07,450
She is going to a summer school.

1524
00:54:07,451 --> 00:54:08,919
- That's right. - Because of you,

1525
00:54:08,920 --> 00:54:11,243
so many people think the rumor is true.

1526
00:54:11,661 --> 00:54:12,759
Cho Rong heard the rumor.

1527
00:54:12,760 --> 00:54:15,185
Really? Did you hear the rumor?

1528
00:54:15,231 --> 00:54:16,460
- Really? - I heard you have a child.

1529
00:54:16,461 --> 00:54:17,489
- What? - A child?

1530
00:54:17,490 --> 00:54:20,160
(Carefree)

1531
00:54:20,161 --> 00:54:21,830
Me? In LA?

1532
00:54:21,831 --> 00:54:24,700
Cho Rong's carefree words...

1533
00:54:24,701 --> 00:54:26,100
entered my ears so clearly.

1534
00:54:26,101 --> 00:54:28,339
- My goodness. - Seriously.

1535
00:54:28,340 --> 00:54:30,739
I am starting to have doubts since I heard it so often.

1536
00:54:30,740 --> 00:54:32,339
Maybe he really has a child.

1537
00:54:32,340 --> 00:54:35,279
We can't let them go without a performance.

1538
00:54:35,280 --> 00:54:36,279
That's right.

1539
00:54:36,280 --> 00:54:38,350
Apink!

1540
00:54:38,351 --> 00:54:39,950
(Let's see the powerful and pure Apink's performance.)

1541
00:54:39,951 --> 00:54:42,049
- They have so many hit songs. - That's right.

1542
00:54:42,050 --> 00:54:43,132
My goodness.

1543
00:54:49,490 --> 00:54:54,200
(Their most popular song livens up the atmosphere.)

1544
00:54:54,201 --> 00:54:56,200
(The uncle fans yell the chants.)

1545
00:54:56,201 --> 00:54:58,299
(When Apink members show the refreshing dance moves,)

1546
00:54:58,300 --> 00:55:00,392
(the uncle fans show dirty dance moves.)

1547
00:55:00,541 --> 00:55:06,601
(The members turn the shoot into an Apink concert.)

1548
00:55:09,880 --> 00:55:10,950
(Powerful)

1549
00:55:10,951 --> 00:55:13,350
(Pure)

1550
00:55:13,351 --> 00:55:15,350
(Fresh)

1551
00:55:15,351 --> 00:55:16,936
(Cheerful)

1552
00:55:17,190 --> 00:55:18,219
(The performance of "Luv" ends.)

1553
00:55:18,220 --> 00:55:19,270
What?

1554
00:55:20,061 --> 00:55:22,282
- Here comes another song. - Gosh, don't do this.

1555
00:55:22,490 --> 00:55:23,976
Don't do this.

1556
00:55:24,461 --> 00:55:27,299
("I'm So Sick" by Apink)

1557
00:55:27,300 --> 00:55:28,887
"I'm So Sick".

1558
00:55:29,670 --> 00:55:31,939
(Jae Seok shows off his good cheer.)

1559
00:55:31,940 --> 00:55:35,140
(The medley of Apink songs makes everyone excited.)

1560
00:55:35,141 --> 00:55:36,857
(Jae Seok is captivated.)

1561
00:55:37,641 --> 00:55:38,651
(Call me!)

1562
00:55:39,440 --> 00:55:40,450
(No!)

1563
00:55:41,141 --> 00:55:44,383
(The girl group with 8 years of experiences makes them chant.)

1564
00:55:49,621 --> 00:55:53,055
(The stage becomes heated up.)

1565
00:55:55,831 --> 00:55:57,578
Code Kunst took off his jacket.

1566
00:55:58,360 --> 00:56:00,230
(He took off his jacket.)

1567
00:56:00,231 --> 00:56:01,644
You put your hands together.

1568
00:56:02,470 --> 00:56:04,270
- It's my first time to see them. - Really?

1569
00:56:04,271 --> 00:56:05,655
He is in awe.

1570
00:56:05,970 --> 00:56:09,243
(There is no exit from the fairy-like group's charms.)

1571
00:56:13,911 --> 00:56:17,450
(The original fairy-like group, Apink)

1572
00:56:17,451 --> 00:56:19,649
(Everyone stands up.)

1573
00:56:19,650 --> 00:56:22,114
- Come, come. - They have many hit songs.

1574
00:56:22,650 --> 00:56:26,225
Please give Apink another round of applause.

1575
00:56:26,590 --> 00:56:27,819
- Apink is the best. - Everyone.

1576
00:56:27,820 --> 00:56:29,982
- I knew it. - Apink finally made...

1577
00:56:30,090 --> 00:56:33,232
Code Kunst wear an outfit that suits the weather.

1578
00:56:34,061 --> 00:56:35,585
Congratulations, Code Kunst!

1579
00:56:35,731 --> 00:56:36,730
(We did it.)

1580
00:56:36,731 --> 00:56:38,230
Code Kunst looks happy.

1581
00:56:38,231 --> 00:56:40,392
The sun and summer failed,

1582
00:56:41,001 --> 00:56:42,353
- but Apink succeeded. - Seriously.

1583
00:56:42,440 --> 00:56:44,069
He didn't stand up once before.

1584
00:56:44,070 --> 00:56:46,439
Then he suddenly took off his jacket and stood up.

1585
00:56:46,440 --> 00:56:49,208
He watched with his hands put together.

1586
00:56:49,280 --> 00:56:50,998
Ji Yeon, I am sorry.

1587
00:56:51,181 --> 00:56:52,950
- Why? - We blocked you...

1588
00:56:52,951 --> 00:56:54,365
too much.

1589
00:56:54,820 --> 00:56:57,020
Jong Kook's shoulders hit her a few times.

1590
00:56:57,021 --> 00:56:59,020
I wanted to watch Apink's performance,

1591
00:56:59,021 --> 00:57:01,081
- but I couldn't see anything. - I am sorry.

1592
00:57:01,590 --> 00:57:05,237
(When the atmosphere heated up earlier)

1593
00:57:05,561 --> 00:57:08,156
(I want to watch the performance.)

1594
00:57:08,360 --> 00:57:09,399
I am sorry.

1595
00:57:09,400 --> 00:57:12,299
- We went too crazy. - It's okay.

1596
00:57:12,300 --> 00:57:13,887
- "We went too crazy." - Seriously.

1597
00:57:14,001 --> 00:57:15,757
Give them a round of applause.

1598
00:57:16,311 --> 00:57:19,839
- It was really nice. - It was so much fun.

1599
00:57:19,840 --> 00:57:22,279
Since it's hot, I will hurry up and give you the rules.

1600
00:57:22,280 --> 00:57:24,850
Today, you will choose your partner for collaboration...

1601
00:57:24,851 --> 00:57:26,080
through Part Five of Nine Years of Running Man,

1602
00:57:26,081 --> 00:57:27,850
- Teamwork Race. - Okay.

1603
00:57:27,851 --> 00:57:29,350
Do you like your partners?

1604
00:57:29,351 --> 00:57:30,489
- Yes. - Yes.

1605
00:57:30,490 --> 00:57:32,460
- Yes. - Some of you...

1606
00:57:32,461 --> 00:57:33,976
might not like your partners.

1607
00:57:34,220 --> 00:57:37,089
The race consists of three rounds of team competitions.

1608
00:57:37,090 --> 00:57:40,535
The teams will be set at the end of the last mission.

1609
00:57:40,760 --> 00:57:42,770
- The partners can change now. - I see.

1610
00:57:42,771 --> 00:57:45,939
If you don't like your partners,

1611
00:57:45,940 --> 00:57:48,439
you can weed them out through the missions.

1612
00:57:48,440 --> 00:57:49,540
"Weed them out"?

1613
00:57:49,541 --> 00:57:51,040
Kwang Soo will be weeded out.

1614
00:57:51,041 --> 00:57:52,339
He uses such mean words.

1615
00:57:52,340 --> 00:57:54,540
- "Weed them out"? - How could you say that?

1616
00:57:54,541 --> 00:57:56,950
The 1st and 2nd place winners of the mission will be given...

1617
00:57:56,951 --> 00:58:00,450
special cards for changing the team members.

1618
00:58:00,451 --> 00:58:03,450
There are Change One and Change Both cards.

1619
00:58:03,451 --> 00:58:06,960
If all members submit the same card, the team will stay the same.

1620
00:58:06,961 --> 00:58:09,660
If a member submits a different card,

1621
00:58:09,661 --> 00:58:13,200
the team will be changed in accordance with that card.

1622
00:58:13,201 --> 00:58:16,230
Let's get the race started after you change.

1623
00:58:16,231 --> 00:58:18,593
(Who will be the final collaboration partner?)

1624
00:58:20,170 --> 00:58:22,493
It's a paradise. It's a paradise.

1625
00:58:22,541 --> 00:58:24,530
- It really is a paradise. - It's so cool.

1626
00:58:24,740 --> 00:58:25,839
I can finally breathe.

1627
00:58:25,840 --> 00:58:26,839
(They relax indoors after struggling under the sun.)

1628
00:58:26,840 --> 00:58:28,850
(Turning around)

1629
00:58:28,851 --> 00:58:31,577
(She suppresses her laughter.)

1630
00:58:32,650 --> 00:58:35,149
We are the only ones who look like middle-aged men.

1631
00:58:35,150 --> 00:58:36,649
(We are the only ones who look like middle-aged men.)

1632
00:58:36,650 --> 00:58:38,919
(It's especially true since they are wearing a uniform.)

1633
00:58:38,920 --> 00:58:42,496
We are neither fresh nor trendy.

1634
00:58:42,760 --> 00:58:43,930
- I am talking about our looks. - Yet we are on the front row.

1635
00:58:43,931 --> 00:58:46,129
We are the only ones who look like middle-aged men.

1636
00:58:46,130 --> 00:58:47,129
(They have friendliness.)

1637
00:58:47,130 --> 00:58:49,469
The first row is a disaster.

1638
00:58:49,470 --> 00:58:50,899
(The first mission starts with the friendly SORAN.)

1639
00:58:50,900 --> 00:58:53,799
You can weed out the team members you don't like...

1640
00:58:53,800 --> 00:58:56,140
and recruit team members you like...

1641
00:58:56,141 --> 00:58:58,140
- through this opportunity. - This is nerve-wracking.

1642
00:58:58,141 --> 00:59:02,049
Stop talking about weeding people out.

1643
00:59:02,110 --> 00:59:04,009
This is the first mission,

1644
00:59:04,010 --> 00:59:06,120
a relay in three parts, Do You Trust Me?

1645
00:59:06,121 --> 00:59:07,279
- Do You Trust Me? - Do You Trust Me?

1646
00:59:07,280 --> 00:59:08,319
(Do You Trust Me?)

1647
00:59:08,320 --> 00:59:10,371
- It's about trust. - That's right.

1648
00:59:10,451 --> 00:59:11,649
Okay. Let's go.

1649
00:59:11,650 --> 00:59:14,852
Three representatives from each team can participate.

1650
00:59:15,220 --> 00:59:17,460
In the set time of three minutes,

1651
00:59:17,461 --> 00:59:20,230
the team members must finish the relay.

1652
00:59:20,231 --> 00:59:22,330
The first player must sing...

1653
00:59:22,331 --> 00:59:24,700
two songs in a row like playing the word chain...

1654
00:59:24,701 --> 00:59:27,200
using the first word that is given by the production crew.

1655
00:59:27,201 --> 00:59:28,270
That's too hard.

1656
00:59:28,271 --> 00:59:30,009
We have to play word chain using songs.

1657
00:59:30,010 --> 00:59:31,939
Let's say "Sun" is the given word.

1658
00:59:31,940 --> 00:59:33,640
Sun sets at Soyang River

1659
00:59:33,641 --> 00:59:35,310
Eh, eh, eh, 2NE1

1660
00:59:35,311 --> 00:59:37,649
- That's how you play. - It's beyond our intelligence.

1661
00:59:37,650 --> 00:59:39,750
It's too hard.

1662
00:59:39,751 --> 00:59:41,180
This is what the second member will do.

1663
00:59:41,181 --> 00:59:43,219
The first player finished up with "2NE1".

1664
00:59:43,220 --> 00:59:46,120
Kung Kung Ta, One piece, Kung Kung Ta, Switzerland,

1665
00:59:46,121 --> 00:59:49,897
Kung Kung Ta, Stockings, Do three words in a row.

1666
00:59:50,561 --> 00:59:52,560
- That's so hard. - What does that mean?

1667
00:59:52,561 --> 00:59:53,759
(He doesn't understand the rules.)

1668
00:59:53,760 --> 00:59:55,416
You play word chain alone.

1669
00:59:56,231 --> 00:59:57,899
This is what the third player will do.

1670
00:59:57,900 --> 00:59:59,299
The last round ended with "Stockings", right?

1671
00:59:59,300 --> 01:00:02,370
Then name three movies with "King" in the title.

1672
01:00:02,371 --> 01:00:03,370
(That's what the 3rd player needs to do.)

1673
01:00:03,371 --> 01:00:05,640
(Name 3 movie titles that contain the last word of Round 2.)

1674
01:00:05,641 --> 01:00:07,839
- "Kingsman", "Kingdom". - This is really hard.

1675
01:00:07,840 --> 01:00:10,350
If the third player fails,

1676
01:00:10,351 --> 01:00:11,810
you go back to the first player.

1677
01:00:11,811 --> 01:00:13,498
This is so hard.

1678
01:00:14,650 --> 01:00:16,290
Apink. Apink.

1679
01:00:16,291 --> 01:00:18,489
Who knows a lot of movies?

1680
01:00:18,490 --> 01:00:19,572
I will do it.

1681
01:00:20,561 --> 01:00:22,730
I will do it with two members of Apink.

1682
01:00:22,731 --> 01:00:24,660
(He makes a decision alone.)

1683
01:00:24,661 --> 01:00:26,129
Then Ha Young and...

1684
01:00:26,130 --> 01:00:28,359
Did you hear Seok Jin? "I will do it."

1685
01:00:28,360 --> 01:00:31,198
"I will do it with two members of Apink."

1686
01:00:31,331 --> 01:00:32,815
Seok Jin, I am upset.

1687
01:00:33,340 --> 01:00:35,200
Seok Jin.

1688
01:00:35,201 --> 01:00:36,569
I am nervous.

1689
01:00:36,570 --> 01:00:39,580
Let's go. Ha Young, don't be down.

1690
01:00:39,581 --> 01:00:41,339
- I was thinking. - Don't think.

1691
01:00:41,340 --> 01:00:42,350
Get ready.

1692
01:00:42,351 --> 01:00:43,492
(I don't think.)

1693
01:00:43,911 --> 01:00:45,450
Let's see how they do it.

1694
01:00:45,451 --> 01:00:46,764
- Let's go. - Okay.

1695
01:00:46,851 --> 01:00:49,072
Get ready. Set, go.

1696
01:00:49,490 --> 01:00:52,319
(The given word is "This")

1697
01:00:52,320 --> 01:00:55,560
(This is the moment, this is the day)

1698
01:00:55,561 --> 01:01:02,169
(When I call my mom)

1699
01:01:02,170 --> 01:01:03,299
She is good.

1700
01:01:03,300 --> 01:01:05,330
(My heart hurts so much)

1701
01:01:05,331 --> 01:01:08,674
(The most precious)

1702
01:01:09,141 --> 01:01:10,169
"Han".

1703
01:01:10,170 --> 01:01:12,180
(It's time for "Kung Kung Ta".)

1704
01:01:12,181 --> 01:01:15,009
(Seok Jin needs to come up with 3 words for word chain.)

1705
01:01:15,010 --> 01:01:18,009
Hannibal, Kung Kung Ta, Foot odor, Kung Kung Ta

1706
01:01:18,010 --> 01:01:19,549
Saetaeryeong

1707
01:01:19,550 --> 01:01:21,020
"Ryeong".

1708
01:01:21,021 --> 01:01:22,350
- "Ryeong". - "Ryeong".

1709
01:01:22,351 --> 01:01:23,750
- "Ryeong". - "Ryeong".

1710
01:01:23,751 --> 01:01:24,919
(In 10 seconds, she needs to name 3 movies titles...)

1711
01:01:24,920 --> 01:01:26,819
- "Young" works as well. - "Ryeong".

1712
01:01:26,820 --> 01:01:28,089
(which contain either "Ryeong" or "Young".)

1713
01:01:28,090 --> 01:01:29,242
"Dead Friend 1, 2, and 3".

1714
01:01:29,260 --> 01:01:30,560
"Dead Friend One".

1715
01:01:30,561 --> 01:01:32,359
(Ha Young begins.)

1716
01:01:32,360 --> 01:01:34,824
- "0.0MHz". - "0.0MHz".

1717
01:01:34,831 --> 01:01:36,330
(Ha Young goes over the set time.)

1718
01:01:36,331 --> 01:01:37,442
"Ryeong" was a good one.

1719
01:01:37,530 --> 01:01:38,939
- Keep going. - Go again.

1720
01:01:38,940 --> 01:01:41,040
- Ha Young won't do. - I want to try it.

1721
01:01:41,041 --> 01:01:42,626
Okay.

1722
01:01:43,271 --> 01:01:45,270
- "Ki". - You can go second.

1723
01:01:45,271 --> 01:01:46,290
I will go third.

1724
01:01:47,110 --> 01:01:49,109
(When the train moves through the darkness)

1725
01:01:49,110 --> 01:01:50,109
There you go.

1726
01:01:50,110 --> 01:01:51,710
(And crosses over Milky Way)

1727
01:01:51,711 --> 01:01:55,120
(Sunlight falls at the space station.)

1728
01:01:55,121 --> 01:01:58,859
(Edelweiss, edelweiss)

1729
01:01:58,860 --> 01:02:00,319
- "S". - "S".

1730
01:02:00,320 --> 01:02:03,589
(They need to list 3 words in word chain.)

1731
01:02:03,590 --> 01:02:05,044
Switzerland, Kung Kung Ta

1732
01:02:05,931 --> 01:02:07,560
Sri Lanka, Kung Kung Ta

1733
01:02:07,561 --> 01:02:09,230
- No! - Cho Rong! It's three syllables.

1734
01:02:09,231 --> 01:02:11,730
(She fails since her chosen word went over three syllables.)

1735
01:02:11,731 --> 01:02:12,739
- Cho Rong. - Three syllables.

1736
01:02:12,740 --> 01:02:14,640
Three syllables, don't you remember?

1737
01:02:14,641 --> 01:02:16,488
- What? - Keep going.

1738
01:02:16,940 --> 01:02:18,739
"Look". "Look".

1739
01:02:18,740 --> 01:02:20,140
- Didn't you know? - "Look".

1740
01:02:20,141 --> 01:02:21,710
Look at me, look at me

1741
01:02:21,711 --> 01:02:24,180
Look at me, look at me

1742
01:02:24,181 --> 01:02:25,836
Look at me

1743
01:02:25,851 --> 01:02:27,219
So

1744
01:02:27,220 --> 01:02:29,372
- So - Sotseokung, Sotseokung

1745
01:02:29,791 --> 01:02:32,316
Sotseokung, Sotseokung

1746
01:02:32,461 --> 01:02:34,986
If you win, can you change a team member?

1747
01:02:35,021 --> 01:02:36,980
- Seok Jin is working very hard. - Seok Jin is working very hard.

1748
01:02:37,130 --> 01:02:40,090
My love who left said that he will return

1749
01:02:40,530 --> 01:02:43,069
- Kung Kung Ta, Kung Kung Ta - Kung Kung Ta, Kung Kung Ta

1750
01:02:43,070 --> 01:02:44,399
- Yogurt, Kung Kung Ta - Kung Kung Ta

1751
01:02:44,400 --> 01:02:45,500
- "Re" - Re...

1752
01:02:45,501 --> 01:02:46,899
Rare car, Kung Kung Ta

1753
01:02:46,900 --> 01:02:49,009
(Rare car?)

1754
01:02:49,010 --> 01:02:50,770
(She fails Kung Kung Ta.)

1755
01:02:50,771 --> 01:02:52,310
She should've come up with an easy one.

1756
01:02:52,311 --> 01:02:53,680
There's ready-mix concrete.

1757
01:02:53,681 --> 01:02:55,379
She should've come up with an easy one.

1758
01:02:55,380 --> 01:02:56,895
She's so obstinate.

1759
01:02:56,981 --> 01:02:58,509
- Eun Ji did a good job. - Good job.

1760
01:02:58,510 --> 01:03:00,439
I can't seem to think here.

1761
01:03:00,481 --> 01:03:01,531
I can't think.

1762
01:03:01,720 --> 01:03:03,319
Even if you can't think,

1763
01:03:03,320 --> 01:03:04,520
Cho Rong was so careless.

1764
01:03:04,521 --> 01:03:06,036
How can she say "rare car"?

1765
01:03:06,990 --> 01:03:09,082
She follows the flow of her consciousness.

1766
01:03:09,630 --> 01:03:10,771
For my team,

1767
01:03:11,690 --> 01:03:12,960
So Min will play.

1768
01:03:12,961 --> 01:03:14,460
- Yu Il knows many movies. - Yu Il.

1769
01:03:14,461 --> 01:03:16,016
- Yu Il will play. - He knows lots of movies.

1770
01:03:16,101 --> 01:03:17,270
(Yu Il, a fan of movies, joins.)

1771
01:03:17,271 --> 01:03:19,220
Here's Yu Il who is very ordinary.

1772
01:03:19,601 --> 01:03:20,953
He's the ordinary himself.

1773
01:03:21,840 --> 01:03:23,022
In general,

1774
01:03:23,271 --> 01:03:25,027
after spending time with SORAN,

1775
01:03:25,110 --> 01:03:26,580
I noticed that they're quiet.

1776
01:03:26,581 --> 01:03:27,853
(They're quiet.)

1777
01:03:28,780 --> 01:03:31,009
(They aren't noisy at all.)

1778
01:03:31,010 --> 01:03:32,121
They don't talk.

1779
01:03:32,251 --> 01:03:33,463
If I don't ask questions...

1780
01:03:33,820 --> 01:03:35,149
None of them talk if I don't ask them questions.

1781
01:03:35,150 --> 01:03:36,535
(We never heard their voice.)

1782
01:03:36,990 --> 01:03:38,031
Let's start.

1783
01:03:38,650 --> 01:03:39,700
- Get ready. - You got this.

1784
01:03:40,420 --> 01:03:41,976
Start.

1785
01:03:43,161 --> 01:03:45,060
I'll give you everything

1786
01:03:45,061 --> 01:03:46,616
Hey, everyone

1787
01:03:46,701 --> 01:03:47,741
That was good.

1788
01:03:48,331 --> 01:03:51,129
(Next is Kung Kung Ta.)

1789
01:03:51,130 --> 01:03:53,322
Children, perilla oil.

1790
01:03:53,940 --> 01:03:54,939
Hum, hum, hum.

1791
01:03:54,940 --> 01:03:56,253
("Hum, hum, hum"?)

1792
01:03:57,010 --> 01:03:59,480
(Is she humming?)

1793
01:03:59,481 --> 01:04:00,653
Let me do it again.

1794
01:04:01,380 --> 01:04:02,794
What's "hum, hum, hum"?

1795
01:04:03,251 --> 01:04:04,523
She's the problem.

1796
01:04:04,610 --> 01:04:05,850
She's the problem now.

1797
01:04:05,851 --> 01:04:07,668
- She isn't working hard. - She's the problem.

1798
01:04:08,451 --> 01:04:09,804
Why is she changing places?

1799
01:04:10,451 --> 01:04:11,689
Don't get it right.

1800
01:04:11,690 --> 01:04:13,205
(So Min decides to name movie titles.)

1801
01:04:14,320 --> 01:04:15,359
"La".

1802
01:04:15,360 --> 01:04:17,885
The fragrance of lilacs

1803
01:04:18,530 --> 01:04:20,629
A train runs through the darkness

1804
01:04:20,630 --> 01:04:21,799
- "Go". - Through the darkness

1805
01:04:21,800 --> 01:04:23,270
(It's time to play Kung Kung Ta with "go".)

1806
01:04:23,271 --> 01:04:24,569
That's good.

1807
01:04:24,570 --> 01:04:26,358
- Ko Young Bae. - Kung Kung Ta

1808
01:04:26,701 --> 01:04:28,922
- Bae Cheol Soo - Kung Kung Ta

1809
01:04:29,041 --> 01:04:31,090
- Swimming pool - Kung Kung Ta

1810
01:04:31,311 --> 01:04:32,310
It's "jang".

1811
01:04:32,311 --> 01:04:33,710
(Last is Naming Movie Titles.)

1812
01:04:33,711 --> 01:04:34,710
"Jang" is easy.

1813
01:04:34,711 --> 01:04:36,410
(She must name 3 movie titles with "jang" in them.)

1814
01:04:36,411 --> 01:04:38,810
The third player has to name three movie titles.

1815
01:04:38,811 --> 01:04:40,800
(What movie titles are there with "jang" in them?)

1816
01:04:41,021 --> 01:04:42,120
"Mother-in-law".

1817
01:04:42,121 --> 01:04:43,850
("Mother-in-law")

1818
01:04:43,851 --> 01:04:46,419
(What?)

1819
01:04:46,420 --> 01:04:47,719
- Come on, So Min. - "Mosquito Net".

1820
01:04:47,720 --> 01:04:48,730
Wait.

1821
01:04:49,030 --> 01:04:50,202
- "Mosquito Net". - Come on, So Min.

1822
01:04:50,331 --> 01:04:51,745
No, wait.

1823
01:04:52,331 --> 01:04:54,220
There's nothing with "jang" in it.

1824
01:04:54,561 --> 01:04:56,822
There is "The General's Son".

1825
01:04:56,831 --> 01:04:57,969
The time is up.

1826
01:04:57,970 --> 01:04:59,299
(Team SORAN fails.)

1827
01:04:59,300 --> 01:05:01,088
I'm not sure if this is a good thing.

1828
01:05:01,501 --> 01:05:03,631
I'm not sure.

1829
01:05:05,041 --> 01:05:06,393
- Let's go. - Okay.

1830
01:05:06,481 --> 01:05:07,580
It'll be easy.

1831
01:05:07,581 --> 01:05:09,500
This team is small.

1832
01:05:09,610 --> 01:05:12,180
It'll be a good team if you kick out one member.

1833
01:05:12,181 --> 01:05:14,419
(He speaks vaguely.)

1834
01:05:14,420 --> 01:05:15,561
We won't change members, will we?

1835
01:05:15,891 --> 01:05:17,062
We won't change members, will we?

1836
01:05:17,291 --> 01:05:18,502
- Of course not. - Really?

1837
01:05:18,621 --> 01:05:19,872
"We won't change members, will we"?

1838
01:05:20,220 --> 01:05:21,503
He asked if they'll change members.

1839
01:05:22,190 --> 01:05:23,543
We definitely won't change.

1840
01:05:23,590 --> 01:05:24,859
- Let's start. - Okay.

1841
01:05:24,860 --> 01:05:26,174
- Okay. - Get ready.

1842
01:05:27,101 --> 01:05:28,918
- We can do it. - Set.

1843
01:05:29,800 --> 01:05:31,315
- Go. - "Bo"?

1844
01:05:32,170 --> 01:05:33,299
"Bo"?

1845
01:05:33,300 --> 01:05:35,540
- Like purple color - That's right.

1846
01:05:35,541 --> 01:05:37,870
- Like purple color - That's right.

1847
01:05:37,871 --> 01:05:39,456
She's good. She sings right away.

1848
01:05:39,780 --> 01:05:42,239
It approached me lightly

1849
01:05:42,240 --> 01:05:44,231
At this moment

1850
01:05:44,280 --> 01:05:45,310
She's good.

1851
01:05:45,311 --> 01:05:46,580
At this moment

1852
01:05:46,581 --> 01:05:47,950
(He has to say three words starting with "gan".)

1853
01:05:47,951 --> 01:05:49,290
- "Gan". - "Gan"?

1854
01:05:49,291 --> 01:05:51,049
Flag stop, Kung Kung Ta

1855
01:05:51,050 --> 01:05:52,960
Post horse...

1856
01:05:52,961 --> 01:05:54,419
What? Why is it so difficult?

1857
01:05:54,420 --> 01:05:56,290
- Post horse... - Stagecoach.

1858
01:05:56,291 --> 01:05:57,806
What? Why is it so difficult?

1859
01:05:57,860 --> 01:05:59,129
- Can we play again? - Yeoksam-dong.

1860
01:05:59,130 --> 01:06:00,500
- Yeoksam-dong. - Yeoksam-dong.

1861
01:06:00,501 --> 01:06:02,045
- Don't you want to play? - Knotweeds.

1862
01:06:02,130 --> 01:06:03,399
There's Yeoksam-dong.

1863
01:06:03,400 --> 01:06:04,469
- That was... - Let's go again.

1864
01:06:04,470 --> 01:06:06,187
- No. - You aren't working hard.

1865
01:06:07,041 --> 01:06:08,283
("Ga")

1866
01:06:08,771 --> 01:06:13,557
- Are you really leaving? - They almost made it.

1867
01:06:14,641 --> 01:06:19,599
Singing, singing, mambo

1868
01:06:19,951 --> 01:06:22,172
- She can sing anything. - Gummy is very good.

1869
01:06:22,320 --> 01:06:24,319
- Boiler - Kung Kung Ta

1870
01:06:24,320 --> 01:06:26,560
- Russia - Kung Kung Ta

1871
01:06:26,561 --> 01:06:28,489
(They might succeed.)

1872
01:06:28,490 --> 01:06:30,460
- Russia - Kung Kung Ta

1873
01:06:30,461 --> 01:06:32,551
- Mister - Kung Kung Ta

1874
01:06:32,760 --> 01:06:34,129
- "Ssi". - Kwang Soo.

1875
01:06:34,130 --> 01:06:35,515
"The Surrogate Woman".

1876
01:06:36,231 --> 01:06:37,799
- "The Surrogate Woman"? - "The Surrogate Woman".

1877
01:06:37,800 --> 01:06:39,069
(Mumbling)

1878
01:06:39,070 --> 01:06:41,100
(Kang Soo Yeon won Best Actress at the Venice Film Festival...)

1879
01:06:41,101 --> 01:06:43,069
(for her role in this movie.)

1880
01:06:43,070 --> 01:06:45,609
- "The Surrogate Woman". - "The Surrogate Woman".

1881
01:06:45,610 --> 01:06:46,910
- "The Man from Nowhere". - "The Man from Nowhere".

1882
01:06:46,911 --> 01:06:48,040
"The Handmaiden".

1883
01:06:48,041 --> 01:06:49,869
- "The Handmaiden". - "The Hand"...

1884
01:06:49,981 --> 01:06:51,149
"The Handmaiden".

1885
01:06:51,150 --> 01:06:52,819
- "The Handmaiden". - "The Handmaiden".

1886
01:06:52,820 --> 01:06:54,568
- "The Handmaiden". - "The Handmaiden".

1887
01:06:54,980 --> 01:06:57,450
(They succeed.)

1888
01:06:57,451 --> 01:06:58,620
We got it.

1889
01:06:58,621 --> 01:07:01,090
(Team Gummy clears the mission.)

1890
01:07:01,091 --> 01:07:02,689
There was "The Handmaiden".

1891
01:07:02,690 --> 01:07:04,003
Who said "The Handmaiden"?

1892
01:07:04,230 --> 01:07:05,605
- Why, Ha Young? - Ha Young.

1893
01:07:05,930 --> 01:07:07,059
- Why did you tell them? - I wanted to swap.

1894
01:07:07,060 --> 01:07:08,818
- I thought we could swap. - To swap?

1895
01:07:09,171 --> 01:07:10,500
- To swap? - That's smart.

1896
01:07:10,501 --> 01:07:11,683
I thought that they'd swap with us.

1897
01:07:12,331 --> 01:07:13,439
They got it.

1898
01:07:13,440 --> 01:07:15,840
It's the only team that was successful.

1899
01:07:15,841 --> 01:07:18,740
(Team Gummy wins a chance to swap team members.)

1900
01:07:19,881 --> 01:07:21,679
They won a chance to get rid of a member whom they dislike.

1901
01:07:21,680 --> 01:07:23,710
(They won a chance to get rid of a member whom they dislike.)

1902
01:07:23,711 --> 01:07:26,781
(Does he have to talk in a mean way?)

1903
01:07:28,150 --> 01:07:30,389
To determine the second place, you'll play Kung Kung Ta.

1904
01:07:30,390 --> 01:07:31,720
- Okay. - After repeating "Kung Kung Ta",

1905
01:07:31,721 --> 01:07:33,590
name a food item for the last word.

1906
01:07:33,591 --> 01:07:36,358
The last word should be a food item.

1907
01:07:36,661 --> 01:07:37,660
Do you understand?

1908
01:07:37,661 --> 01:07:39,146
You can't repeat any words.

1909
01:07:39,261 --> 01:07:40,599
- You win after playing two rounds. - Okay.

1910
01:07:40,600 --> 01:07:41,741
Do we name food items?

1911
01:07:41,860 --> 01:07:43,547
Nucksal and Code Kunst.

1912
01:07:44,070 --> 01:07:45,485
- Ji Hyo should play. - Come on, guys.

1913
01:07:45,570 --> 01:07:47,370
1, 2, 3, 4.

1914
01:07:47,371 --> 01:07:50,239
- Kungs, Kungs, Kungs - Kungs, Kungs, Kungs

1915
01:07:50,240 --> 01:07:53,309
- Kung Kung Ta, Kung Kung Ta - Kung Kung Ta, Kung Kung Ta

1916
01:07:53,310 --> 01:07:56,479
- Name a food item at the end - Name a food item at the end

1917
01:07:56,480 --> 01:07:57,979
- Raccoon, Kung Kung Ta - Kung Kung Ta

1918
01:07:57,980 --> 01:07:59,940
- Handcart, Kung Kung Ta - Kung Kung Ta

1919
01:08:00,251 --> 01:08:02,920
Car service center, Kung Kung Ta

1920
01:08:02,921 --> 01:08:04,689
Udon sold at terminals.

1921
01:08:04,690 --> 01:08:05,731
No.

1922
01:08:06,291 --> 01:08:09,229
(Udon sold at terminals?)

1923
01:08:09,230 --> 01:08:10,290
Why not?

1924
01:08:10,291 --> 01:08:11,760
That doesn't work.

1925
01:08:11,761 --> 01:08:13,059
Udon at terminals is the best.

1926
01:08:13,060 --> 01:08:14,500
Isn't it correct?

1927
01:08:14,501 --> 01:08:15,914
It cannot be accepted.

1928
01:08:15,971 --> 01:08:17,586
You're done.

1929
01:08:17,730 --> 01:08:19,899
Code Kunst has never done it before.

1930
01:08:19,900 --> 01:08:21,082
We haven't either.

1931
01:08:22,640 --> 01:08:25,210
(Look at my team first.)

1932
01:08:25,211 --> 01:08:26,210
We've never played this before either.

1933
01:08:26,211 --> 01:08:27,939
- We've never done it before. - Haha is angry.

1934
01:08:27,940 --> 01:08:29,109
Apink members, please come out.

1935
01:08:29,110 --> 01:08:30,279
(We understand you.)

1936
01:08:30,280 --> 01:08:31,349
Se Chan will play this.

1937
01:08:31,350 --> 01:08:33,250
(Team Apink gives a try.)

1938
01:08:33,251 --> 01:08:34,594
- Let's go. - We can do it.

1939
01:08:34,650 --> 01:08:36,019
Let's drive him out.

1940
01:08:36,020 --> 01:08:37,989
(Let's drive him out.)

1941
01:08:37,990 --> 01:08:39,460
Let's get it right and drive him out.

1942
01:08:39,461 --> 01:08:40,602
Let's take out the old stone.

1943
01:08:41,121 --> 01:08:43,059
(Is he talking about me?)

1944
01:08:43,060 --> 01:08:44,778
(The old stone)

1945
01:08:44,930 --> 01:08:46,000
Push him out.

1946
01:08:46,001 --> 01:08:47,576
(They're talking about me.)

1947
01:08:48,761 --> 01:08:49,983
Get ready.

1948
01:08:51,001 --> 01:08:52,870
- Here we go. - Kungs, Kungs, Kungs

1949
01:08:52,871 --> 01:08:54,239
- Kungs, Kungs, Kungs - Kungs, Kungs, Kungs

1950
01:08:54,240 --> 01:08:56,840
- Kung Kung Ta, Kung Kung Ta - Kung Kung Ta, Kung Kung Ta

1951
01:08:56,841 --> 01:09:00,819
- Name a food item at the end - Name a food item at the end

1952
01:09:01,041 --> 01:09:03,010
(The given syllable is "si".)

1953
01:09:03,011 --> 01:09:04,425
Inquisitive...

1954
01:09:04,951 --> 01:09:08,010
(A four-syllable word?)

1955
01:09:08,520 --> 01:09:09,649
"Si"?

1956
01:09:09,650 --> 01:09:12,013
(Where did "inquisitive" come from?)

1957
01:09:12,621 --> 01:09:14,120
- What's wrong with him? - Hey.

1958
01:09:14,121 --> 01:09:15,232
What starts with "si"?

1959
01:09:15,621 --> 01:09:16,974
- Spinach. - Time difference.

1960
01:09:17,461 --> 01:09:19,005
- Change places with Na Eun. - Change.

1961
01:09:19,091 --> 01:09:20,130
I'm sorry.

1962
01:09:20,131 --> 01:09:22,282
Did you see that? Who's better?

1963
01:09:22,360 --> 01:09:24,189
- Let's go, Se Chan. - I can do it.

1964
01:09:24,730 --> 01:09:27,200
(There's only one goal.)

1965
01:09:27,201 --> 01:09:30,039
(His feelings get hurt again.)

1966
01:09:30,440 --> 01:09:33,107
(Hang in there, Seok Jin.)

1967
01:09:33,411 --> 01:09:34,824
I did better than him.

1968
01:09:35,440 --> 01:09:36,649
Do it slowly.

1969
01:09:36,650 --> 01:09:39,205
Kung Kung Ta, Kung Kung Ta

1970
01:09:39,381 --> 01:09:40,450
Let's start.

1971
01:09:40,451 --> 01:09:42,844
- Kungs, Kungs, Kungs - Kungs, Kungs, Kungs

1972
01:09:42,990 --> 01:09:45,515
(Do it very slowly.)

1973
01:09:45,591 --> 01:09:48,590
- Name a food item at the end - Name a food item at the end

1974
01:09:48,591 --> 01:09:49,701
("Seo")

1975
01:09:50,131 --> 01:09:51,746
Western food.

1976
01:09:52,261 --> 01:09:53,371
What are you doing?

1977
01:09:53,801 --> 01:09:56,330
(Are they playing that slowly?)

1978
01:09:56,331 --> 01:09:57,644
What are you doing?

1979
01:09:59,440 --> 01:10:01,562
Epicurism.

1980
01:10:02,940 --> 01:10:04,224
Clorox container.

1981
01:10:05,371 --> 01:10:06,622
Clorox container.

1982
01:10:08,940 --> 01:10:12,649
(She has to name a food item that starts with "tong".)

1983
01:10:12,650 --> 01:10:15,247
(What will be Nam Joo's response?)

1984
01:10:15,751 --> 01:10:16,989
Tong rice.

1985
01:10:16,990 --> 01:10:20,727
(Tong rice)

1986
01:10:21,421 --> 01:10:24,693
(What's that?)

1987
01:10:25,661 --> 01:10:26,943
What is that?

1988
01:10:27,430 --> 01:10:29,753
(What's wrong with her?)

1989
01:10:29,900 --> 01:10:31,386
It exists.

1990
01:10:31,471 --> 01:10:32,581
It's rice in a container.

1991
01:10:32,841 --> 01:10:34,500
There's rice in bamboo.

1992
01:10:34,501 --> 01:10:35,700
Rice in bamboo exists,

1993
01:10:35,701 --> 01:10:36,910
but there's no "Tong Rice".

1994
01:10:36,911 --> 01:10:39,334
- It can say anything at this rate. - Right?

1995
01:10:39,440 --> 01:10:40,855
They're good.

1996
01:10:41,280 --> 01:10:44,109
Myun Ho and Tae Wook are next.

1997
01:10:44,451 --> 01:10:45,895
As you can see,

1998
01:10:46,280 --> 01:10:47,620
they look like new hires.

1999
01:10:47,621 --> 01:10:49,149
(We introduce you to the new hires.)

2000
01:10:49,150 --> 01:10:51,790
(Welcome, new hires at Running Man in 2019)

2001
01:10:51,791 --> 01:10:53,290
(It looks like an orientation for new hires.)

2002
01:10:53,291 --> 01:10:54,532
It's their orientation.

2003
01:10:54,661 --> 01:10:56,882
I thought they were three referees.

2004
01:10:58,131 --> 01:10:59,574
They don't look like musicians at all.

2005
01:11:00,701 --> 01:11:02,529
Please say something.

2006
01:11:02,530 --> 01:11:03,713
Say something.

2007
01:11:03,770 --> 01:11:05,083
These three don't...

2008
01:11:05,331 --> 01:11:08,199
jeer at you.

2009
01:11:08,341 --> 01:11:10,432
Neither do they cheer for the team.

2010
01:11:11,110 --> 01:11:12,840
Three of you.

2011
01:11:12,841 --> 01:11:14,294
You should change places.

2012
01:11:14,581 --> 01:11:16,080
Wait. Myun Ho should sit there.

2013
01:11:16,081 --> 01:11:17,191
(They're changing their seats.)

2014
01:11:17,280 --> 01:11:19,819
(They're moving fast.)

2015
01:11:19,820 --> 01:11:22,880
The way that they change seats is quite systematic too.

2016
01:11:23,551 --> 01:11:25,913
Did you change seats?

2017
01:11:26,621 --> 01:11:28,882
Wait, did you change seats?

2018
01:11:28,961 --> 01:11:30,202
- It doesn't seem like it. - It looks the same.

2019
01:11:30,560 --> 01:11:31,701
Did you change?

2020
01:11:31,860 --> 01:11:33,012
Did they change seats?

2021
01:11:33,631 --> 01:11:34,630
Did you?

2022
01:11:34,631 --> 01:11:36,893
Wait, they didn't change.

2023
01:11:37,001 --> 01:11:38,142
Jae Seok is in the same place.

2024
01:11:38,301 --> 01:11:39,370
We changed our seats.

2025
01:11:39,371 --> 01:11:40,439
- We changed our seats. - Did you?

2026
01:11:40,440 --> 01:11:42,117
Myun Ho changed his seat.

2027
01:11:43,041 --> 01:11:45,010
(They really changed seats.)

2028
01:11:45,011 --> 01:11:46,179
It's because...

2029
01:11:46,180 --> 01:11:48,634
we look quite ordinary.

2030
01:11:49,041 --> 01:11:50,410
We look familiar.

2031
01:11:50,411 --> 01:11:51,849
- They did change. - We did.

2032
01:11:51,850 --> 01:11:53,550
Here we go. Start.

2033
01:11:53,551 --> 01:11:56,290
- Kungs, Kungs, Kungs - Kungs, Kungs, Kungs

2034
01:11:56,291 --> 01:11:57,620
- Kung Kung Ta, Kung Kung Ta - Kung Kung Ta, Kung Kung Ta

2035
01:11:57,621 --> 01:12:00,449
- Name a food item at the end - Name a food item at the end

2036
01:12:00,961 --> 01:12:02,071
Minnow.

2037
01:12:02,591 --> 01:12:03,641
Handcart.

2038
01:12:03,890 --> 01:12:05,660
- Car repair shop. - That's right.

2039
01:12:05,661 --> 01:12:07,099
(Minnow, handcart, car repair shop)

2040
01:12:07,100 --> 01:12:09,323
Turkish ice cream.

2041
01:12:11,501 --> 01:12:12,540
- They have one more round. - Im Chang Jung.

2042
01:12:13,201 --> 01:12:14,383
Im Chang Jung.

2043
01:12:14,770 --> 01:12:15,882
Jeongbalsan.

2044
01:12:16,310 --> 01:12:17,470
San...

2045
01:12:17,471 --> 01:12:18,870
(San...)

2046
01:12:18,871 --> 01:12:19,880
(Fail)

2047
01:12:19,881 --> 01:12:21,122
You should have said it.

2048
01:12:21,211 --> 01:12:23,809
- Foot of a mountain. - That was close.

2049
01:12:23,810 --> 01:12:25,497
We almost had it. Come back in.

2050
01:12:25,551 --> 01:12:27,380
- You could have said... - Did you see them?

2051
01:12:27,381 --> 01:12:28,865
They don't complain.

2052
01:12:28,951 --> 01:12:30,349
They come back right away.

2053
01:12:30,350 --> 01:12:31,735
(Good job, new hires.)

2054
01:12:32,291 --> 01:12:33,532
What should we do?

2055
01:12:33,721 --> 01:12:35,489
Let's get started.

2056
01:12:35,490 --> 01:12:38,260
- What are you doing? - They're strategizing too much.

2057
01:12:38,261 --> 01:12:39,760
- What are you doing? - Code Kunst.

2058
01:12:39,761 --> 01:12:42,800
I'm explaining to them.

2059
01:12:42,900 --> 01:12:45,599
I asked them what they will say if I end with "teo".

2060
01:12:45,600 --> 01:12:48,125
He said, "Haha, there's market gukbap."

2061
01:12:48,501 --> 01:12:50,170
(He said, "There's market gukbap.")

2062
01:12:50,171 --> 01:12:51,321
"Market gukbap"?

2063
01:12:51,640 --> 01:12:53,398
That's how we are.

2064
01:12:53,511 --> 01:12:55,602
We can't help it.

2065
01:12:55,841 --> 01:12:57,063
It's okay.

2066
01:12:57,211 --> 01:12:59,069
It should start with "teo".

2067
01:12:59,211 --> 01:13:01,100
They should know the rules by now.

2068
01:13:01,581 --> 01:13:03,813
- Let's go. - Is Code Kunst the last?

2069
01:13:03,951 --> 01:13:05,133
You can do it.

2070
01:13:05,451 --> 01:13:06,819
You'll be amazed.

2071
01:13:06,820 --> 01:13:08,811
He said that he'll amaze us.

2072
01:13:09,320 --> 01:13:10,529
Okay, we look forward to it.

2073
01:13:10,530 --> 01:13:12,260
- It'll be amazing how I end it. - Okay.

2074
01:13:12,261 --> 01:13:13,260
Let's believe him.

2075
01:13:13,261 --> 01:13:14,800
1, 2, 3, 4.

2076
01:13:14,801 --> 01:13:16,821
(Will Code Kunst end it with a grand finale?)

2077
01:13:17,701 --> 01:13:20,801
- Name a food item at the end - Name a food item at the end

2078
01:13:21,471 --> 01:13:22,670
Sunrise.

2079
01:13:22,671 --> 01:13:24,769
- Okay. - Lee Myun Soo.

2080
01:13:24,770 --> 01:13:26,580
- Okay. - Soo...

2081
01:13:26,581 --> 01:13:28,109
(Lee Myun Soo is wrong.)

2082
01:13:28,110 --> 01:13:29,510
("Lee Myun Soo"?)

2083
01:13:29,511 --> 01:13:31,309
- It's Lim Yeon Soo. - It's Lim.

2084
01:13:31,310 --> 01:13:33,080
(It's Lim, not Lee.)

2085
01:13:33,081 --> 01:13:35,706
- Is it Lim Yeon Soo? - He's not educated either.

2086
01:13:36,421 --> 01:13:37,989
- Go easy on him. - He always does that.

2087
01:13:37,990 --> 01:13:39,233
He doesn't know.

2088
01:13:39,251 --> 01:13:41,381
- Do it twice. - Why am I so nervous?

2089
01:13:41,520 --> 01:13:44,790
- Name a food item at the end - Name a food item at the end

2090
01:13:44,791 --> 01:13:45,859
("Ma")

2091
01:13:45,860 --> 01:13:47,517
- Magma. - Kung Kung Ta

2092
01:13:47,961 --> 01:13:49,748
Magma, Kung Kung Ta

2093
01:13:49,831 --> 01:13:50,911
You can't repeat words.

2094
01:13:51,501 --> 01:13:52,630
(They said that no words can be repeated.)

2095
01:13:52,631 --> 01:13:54,055
He doesn't know the rules yet.

2096
01:13:54,841 --> 01:13:56,309
I won't play with you.

2097
01:13:56,310 --> 01:13:58,340
(I won't play with you.)

2098
01:13:58,341 --> 01:14:00,663
Code Kunst practiced a lot.

2099
01:14:01,581 --> 01:14:02,609
(He couldn't say a word.)

2100
01:14:02,610 --> 01:14:03,910
What are you doing?

2101
01:14:03,911 --> 01:14:06,250
- He doesn't know the rules. - What are you doing, Nucksal?

2102
01:14:06,251 --> 01:14:08,978
- I was ready to end it well. - Go back in.

2103
01:14:09,051 --> 01:14:10,233
Go back in for now.

2104
01:14:10,320 --> 01:14:11,663
- Let's start. - Start.

2105
01:14:12,091 --> 01:14:13,808
(Kung Kung Ta Ri, Kungs Kungs?)

2106
01:14:15,360 --> 01:14:18,229
(What kind of tempo is this?)

2107
01:14:18,230 --> 01:14:19,442
What did you just say?

2108
01:14:19,530 --> 01:14:21,130
What's "Kung Kung Ta Ri, Kungs"?

2109
01:14:21,131 --> 01:14:22,160
(She's never heard of such a tempo.)

2110
01:14:22,161 --> 01:14:24,524
Ha Young, smile a little.

2111
01:14:25,371 --> 01:14:26,856
(She's so serious.)

2112
01:14:27,400 --> 01:14:28,855
We have to win.

2113
01:14:29,171 --> 01:14:31,938
(He's the reason why Team Apink must win.)

2114
01:14:32,270 --> 01:14:34,159
Ha Young looks so serious.

2115
01:14:35,140 --> 01:14:37,050
(They start Kung Kung Ta again.)

2116
01:14:37,051 --> 01:14:39,807
- Name a food item at the end - Name a food item at the end

2117
01:14:40,320 --> 01:14:41,392
Happiness house.

2118
01:14:42,890 --> 01:14:43,950
What?

2119
01:14:43,951 --> 01:14:45,202
(What?)

2120
01:14:45,291 --> 01:14:47,816
(What kind of house?)

2121
01:14:48,190 --> 01:14:49,729
(What's wrong with me today?)

2122
01:14:49,730 --> 01:14:50,889
"Happiness"?

2123
01:14:50,890 --> 01:14:51,960
(That's terrible.)

2124
01:14:51,961 --> 01:14:53,099
Come back in.

2125
01:14:53,100 --> 01:14:54,929
- Come back in. I'm sorry, Ha Young. - Give me one more chance.

2126
01:14:54,930 --> 01:14:57,769
- One more chance. - Go back in. I'm sorry.

2127
01:14:57,770 --> 01:14:59,670
- Give me one more chance. - We don't have time.

2128
01:14:59,671 --> 01:15:01,660
You succeed if you finish one round.

2129
01:15:01,871 --> 01:15:03,210
(Team Nucksal and Code Kunst give it a try.)

2130
01:15:03,211 --> 01:15:04,739
(The syllable is "Ma".)

2131
01:15:04,740 --> 01:15:05,910
Majang-dong.

2132
01:15:05,911 --> 01:15:06,991
Dongjak Station.

2133
01:15:07,180 --> 01:15:08,423
Station employee.

2134
01:15:09,341 --> 01:15:10,927
(Fail)

2135
01:15:11,150 --> 01:15:12,727
- Mother. - Kung Kung Ta

2136
01:15:12,881 --> 01:15:14,519
- Handcart. - Kung Kung Ta

2137
01:15:14,520 --> 01:15:16,097
- Carnival. - Kung Kung Ta

2138
01:15:16,251 --> 01:15:17,550
Foot smell.

2139
01:15:17,551 --> 01:15:19,338
(Fail)

2140
01:15:19,961 --> 01:15:20,971
Okay.

2141
01:15:20,990 --> 01:15:23,059
I'll work hard and stay on Team Apink.

2142
01:15:23,060 --> 01:15:24,059
Here we go.

2143
01:15:24,060 --> 01:15:26,529
- Kung Kung Ta, Kung Kung Ta - Kung Kung Ta, Kung Kung Ta

2144
01:15:26,530 --> 01:15:29,329
- Name a food item at the end - Name a food item at the end

2145
01:15:29,900 --> 01:15:30,910
Seaweed soup.

2146
01:15:31,201 --> 01:15:32,211
Soup bowl.

2147
01:15:32,530 --> 01:15:33,639
Balsamic.

2148
01:15:33,640 --> 01:15:35,340
(Seaweed soup, soup bowl, balsamic)

2149
01:15:35,341 --> 01:15:36,684
Seek weed soup.

2150
01:15:37,371 --> 01:15:38,653
(Fail)

2151
01:15:38,971 --> 01:15:43,020
(What is "seek weed soup"?)

2152
01:15:43,180 --> 01:15:44,450
(Poor Team Apink.)

2153
01:15:44,451 --> 01:15:47,308
How many mistakes is she making?

2154
01:15:47,951 --> 01:15:49,319
(Can we please win?)

2155
01:15:49,320 --> 01:15:51,977
- She wants to keep me on the team. - We'll give you one more chance.

2156
01:15:52,721 --> 01:15:54,438
- You got one more chance. - Thank you.

2157
01:15:54,490 --> 01:15:56,660
- All right, we can do it. - We can do it.

2158
01:15:56,661 --> 01:15:58,090
- We can do it. - Start with Kungs, Kungs.

2159
01:15:58,091 --> 01:15:59,504
(They concentrate and try again.)

2160
01:16:00,331 --> 01:16:02,729
- Kung Kung Ta, Kung Kung Ta - Kung Kung Ta, Kung Kung Ta

2161
01:16:02,730 --> 01:16:05,295
- Name a food item at the end - Name a food item at the end

2162
01:16:05,831 --> 01:16:06,851
First lady.

2163
01:16:07,270 --> 01:16:08,399
Insa-dong.

2164
01:16:08,400 --> 01:16:10,870
(First lady, Insa-dong)

2165
01:16:10,871 --> 01:16:11,921
Dongchimi.

2166
01:16:13,381 --> 01:16:16,380
(If she makes it, they place second.)

2167
01:16:16,451 --> 01:16:19,550
(Will they win this time?)

2168
01:16:19,551 --> 01:16:20,580
Seaweed soup.

2169
01:16:20,581 --> 01:16:22,080
(Seaweed soup)

2170
01:16:22,081 --> 01:16:24,313
(They succeed.)

2171
01:16:25,020 --> 01:16:26,707
(They finally did it.)

2172
01:16:26,791 --> 01:16:29,059
- You shouldn't be happy. - No, they won't.

2173
01:16:29,060 --> 01:16:30,575
They won't betray us.

2174
01:16:32,230 --> 01:16:34,180
- That was great. - We worked hard.

2175
01:16:34,400 --> 01:16:36,000
The winning team, please come out.

2176
01:16:36,001 --> 01:16:37,670
- You did a good job. - Do we come out?

2177
01:16:37,671 --> 01:16:38,870
(It's time to swap members.)

2178
01:16:38,871 --> 01:16:40,053
We were so close.

2179
01:16:40,440 --> 01:16:44,309
Take your time to discuss and show us your card.

2180
01:16:44,310 --> 01:16:45,523
We'll announce now.

2181
01:16:45,541 --> 01:16:47,380
Do we not swap if we give the same card?

2182
01:16:47,381 --> 01:16:48,910
If you give the same card, there won't be any changes.

2183
01:16:48,911 --> 01:16:50,010
(If the cards are the same, the teams remain the same.)

2184
01:16:50,011 --> 01:16:51,950
It will depend on the minority card.

2185
01:16:51,951 --> 01:16:54,041
The one with the minority card gets to decide.

2186
01:16:54,320 --> 01:16:56,649
- Will you keep the same team? - Yes.

2187
01:16:56,650 --> 01:16:59,250
- Do you promise? - I don't want to swap with anyone.

2188
01:16:59,251 --> 01:17:01,620
- Me neither. What about you? - Me neither.

2189
01:17:01,621 --> 01:17:03,689
I want us to become the perfect team.

2190
01:17:03,690 --> 01:17:04,729
I'm worried.

2191
01:17:04,730 --> 01:17:06,781
- I promise. There's no one. - Me neither.

2192
01:17:07,400 --> 01:17:09,559
- It's this one. - Okay.

2193
01:17:09,560 --> 01:17:10,985
- Okay. - This one.

2194
01:17:11,900 --> 01:17:13,800
You saw it, right? Don't be confused.

2195
01:17:13,801 --> 01:17:14,899
We can't get mixed up.

2196
01:17:14,900 --> 01:17:16,284
- All right. - All right.

2197
01:17:16,511 --> 01:17:18,639
1, 2.

2198
01:17:18,640 --> 01:17:22,378
(Will they show the same card as they promised?)

2199
01:17:22,810 --> 01:17:23,820
Three.

2200
01:17:24,011 --> 01:17:26,849
(Both Jong Kook and Kwang Soo pick Change Both card.)

2201
01:17:26,850 --> 01:17:30,120
(What did Gummy choose?)

2202
01:17:30,121 --> 01:17:31,550
- Are we the same? - All three have the same card.

2203
01:17:31,551 --> 01:17:32,561
Okay.

2204
01:17:33,320 --> 01:17:37,729
(All three of them picked Change Both card.)

2205
01:17:37,730 --> 01:17:39,160
I was so startled.

2206
01:17:39,161 --> 01:17:40,676
What?

2207
01:17:41,360 --> 01:17:42,460
(What's wrong with him?)

2208
01:17:42,461 --> 01:17:43,541
Is this the wrong one?

2209
01:17:45,131 --> 01:17:46,484
You startled me.

2210
01:17:48,640 --> 01:17:50,639
I thought that you changed it.

2211
01:17:50,640 --> 01:17:52,429
(I was worried that you changed your card.)

2212
01:17:53,140 --> 01:17:54,979
Did you pick this?

2213
01:17:54,980 --> 01:17:57,250
Did you pick this card?

2214
01:17:57,251 --> 01:17:59,736
- I see. - I would've been disappointed.

2215
01:18:01,221 --> 01:18:02,220
(Team Gummy remains unchanged.)

2216
01:18:02,221 --> 01:18:04,443
I thought you picked the white one.

2217
01:18:05,251 --> 01:18:07,720
They have many obstacles to overcome.

2218
01:18:07,721 --> 01:18:09,276
Team in second place, please come out.

2219
01:18:09,390 --> 01:18:11,729
Let's not discuss and think instead.

2220
01:18:11,730 --> 01:18:13,559
If you think carefully...

2221
01:18:13,560 --> 01:18:16,025
If I think carefully, I can stay on the same team.

2222
01:18:16,060 --> 01:18:18,625
- It's possible. - How do I dance to...

2223
01:18:18,631 --> 01:18:19,813
Apink's songs?

2224
01:18:21,041 --> 01:18:23,470
(Behind Seok Jin who was getting ahead of himself)

2225
01:18:23,471 --> 01:18:24,939
We're discussing without him.

2226
01:18:24,940 --> 01:18:26,109
Join us.

2227
01:18:26,110 --> 01:18:27,756
What are you doing?

2228
01:18:28,240 --> 01:18:30,609
It just happened that way.

2229
01:18:30,610 --> 01:18:31,779
(He's very disappointed.)

2230
01:18:31,780 --> 01:18:33,194
As we were discussing,

2231
01:18:33,421 --> 01:18:35,479
it just happened.

2232
01:18:35,480 --> 01:18:36,833
Don't discuss. Just do it.

2233
01:18:36,951 --> 01:18:38,319
I'll pick just any card.

2234
01:18:38,320 --> 01:18:40,745
Leave it up to luck. Pick whichever card.

2235
01:18:40,990 --> 01:18:43,330
- "Pick whichever card"? - That's interesting.

2236
01:18:43,331 --> 01:18:44,429
We're ready.

2237
01:18:44,430 --> 01:18:45,460
(Which side will luck be on?)

2238
01:18:45,461 --> 01:18:47,899
1, 2.

2239
01:18:47,900 --> 01:18:49,330
(Will Seok Jin rest or will Apink send him away?)

2240
01:18:49,331 --> 01:18:50,370
Three.

2241
01:18:50,371 --> 01:18:51,714
(What's the result?)

2242
01:18:52,430 --> 01:18:54,639
(1 Change Both and 2 Change One)

2243
01:18:54,640 --> 01:18:55,739
Both of them picked the same.

2244
01:18:55,740 --> 01:18:58,639
(Team Apink will change both.)

2245
01:18:59,511 --> 01:19:01,228
(It's a big twist.)

2246
01:19:02,310 --> 01:19:04,402
(Am I being swapped too?)

2247
01:19:04,650 --> 01:19:07,179
In this case, Seok Jin and Se Chan will...

2248
01:19:07,180 --> 01:19:08,349
join a different team.

2249
01:19:08,350 --> 01:19:11,790
- In this case... - You should stay with Apink.

2250
01:19:11,791 --> 01:19:13,090
Can't I change it?

2251
01:19:13,091 --> 01:19:14,120
Both of you will be swapped.

2252
01:19:14,121 --> 01:19:16,630
- Both of you have to leave. - Both of you have to leave.

2253
01:19:16,631 --> 01:19:17,689
- Seok Jin has to leave. - I have to leave?

2254
01:19:17,690 --> 01:19:19,830
- You have to. - Why did I pick this card?

2255
01:19:19,831 --> 01:19:20,960
(Why did I pick this card?)

2256
01:19:20,961 --> 01:19:23,330
(I thought I wouldn't be swapped.)

2257
01:19:23,331 --> 01:19:24,929
You should explain better.

2258
01:19:24,930 --> 01:19:27,040
The final result is the minority card.

2259
01:19:27,041 --> 01:19:28,639
I don't want to join this team.

2260
01:19:28,640 --> 01:19:29,910
If I stand among them,

2261
01:19:29,911 --> 01:19:32,910
I might become ordinary too. I can't join them.

2262
01:19:32,911 --> 01:19:34,052
(He's afraid of becoming ordinary.)

2263
01:19:35,810 --> 01:19:38,450
If I join their team,

2264
01:19:38,451 --> 01:19:40,979
no one will recognize me. I want to avoid that team.

2265
01:19:40,980 --> 01:19:42,697
- You join this team. - Stop it.

2266
01:19:43,251 --> 01:19:45,319
(Se Chan is perfect for the team.)

2267
01:19:45,320 --> 01:19:47,179
- Stop it, Seok Jin. - Join this team.

2268
01:19:47,190 --> 01:19:49,443
You won't find me if I join them.

2269
01:19:49,961 --> 01:19:51,429
- Join this team. - Seok Jin.

2270
01:19:51,430 --> 01:19:52,660
Whom do you choose?

2271
01:19:52,661 --> 01:19:54,651
Either me or So Min has to join your team.

2272
01:19:55,131 --> 01:19:56,359
So Min is a woman.

2273
01:19:56,360 --> 01:19:57,500
- Okay. - Jae Seok should join.

2274
01:19:57,501 --> 01:19:58,914
Me? Okay.

2275
01:19:59,600 --> 01:20:00,939
(Se Chan joins Team SORAN.)

2276
01:20:00,940 --> 01:20:03,395
(Jae Seok joins Team Apink.)

2277
01:20:03,411 --> 01:20:05,027
(Jae Seok is joining us.)

2278
01:20:05,110 --> 01:20:06,899
I'm glad that I'm leaving before they grew on me.

2279
01:20:07,341 --> 01:20:10,149
Look how polite they are.

2280
01:20:10,150 --> 01:20:13,615
Since I'm leaving, they came to walk me out.

2281
01:20:13,721 --> 01:20:15,450
- Goodness. - They're saying hello.

2282
01:20:15,451 --> 01:20:17,036
They came out to see him.

2283
01:20:17,520 --> 01:20:19,050
Se Chan is a good fit.

2284
01:20:19,051 --> 01:20:21,283
Take off your cap.

2285
01:20:21,761 --> 01:20:23,276
Goodness.

2286
01:20:23,430 --> 01:20:24,703
Who's who?

2287
01:20:24,990 --> 01:20:26,949
- Who's who? - Who's who?

2288
01:20:27,201 --> 01:20:28,240
Here you go.

2289
01:20:28,461 --> 01:20:31,069
Code Kunst is looking away...

2290
01:20:31,070 --> 01:20:33,292
and ignoring Seok Jin the most.

2291
01:20:34,270 --> 01:20:36,439
- Hey. - He's looking away.

2292
01:20:36,440 --> 01:20:38,086
Come out, Haha.

2293
01:20:38,810 --> 01:20:40,979
(He picks Haha.)

2294
01:20:40,980 --> 01:20:42,179
I'll join this team.

2295
01:20:42,180 --> 01:20:43,550
I'll join the hip-hop team.

2296
01:20:43,551 --> 01:20:45,096
(Here comes MC Seok Jin.)

2297
01:20:45,650 --> 01:20:47,479
(Welcome, Haha.)

2298
01:20:47,480 --> 01:20:48,580
No.

2299
01:20:48,581 --> 01:20:50,920
Don't leave. I'll join you again.

2300
01:20:50,921 --> 01:20:53,315
- Stay there temporarily. - Haha, stay there temporarily.

2301
01:20:53,820 --> 01:20:55,319
Seriously.

2302
01:20:55,320 --> 01:20:57,451
Our team members are the best.

2303
01:20:57,461 --> 01:20:58,471
No way.

2304
01:20:58,631 --> 01:21:00,318
Apink members look so happy.

2305
01:21:00,400 --> 01:21:02,117
(What will be the final teams?)

2306
01:21:02,631 --> 01:21:03,681
We're leaving.

2307
01:21:03,831 --> 01:21:05,749
(Joint race isn't over yet.)

2308
01:21:05,770 --> 01:21:09,074
(They fight to join members that they want.)

2309
01:21:09,600 --> 01:21:12,266
(Wavering bodies and teamwork)

2310
01:21:12,270 --> 01:21:15,007
(Four teams are in confusion.)

2311
01:21:15,140 --> 01:21:17,179
(I'll fall in the water.)

2312
01:21:17,180 --> 01:21:18,998
(Some team members don't know the rules.)

2313
01:21:19,081 --> 01:21:21,141
(It's good to play without knowing the rules.)

2314
01:21:21,621 --> 01:21:24,651
(Those who try to defend their team no matter what...)

2315
01:21:24,690 --> 01:21:27,013
(fight with those who try to leave the team.)

2316
01:21:27,161 --> 01:21:29,917
(What will be the final teams?)

2317
01:21:30,661 --> 01:21:33,084
(My Partner is Faraway on Running Man)
