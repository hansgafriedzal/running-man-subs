1
00:00:06,050 --> 00:00:07,760
- Hello. - Hello.

2
00:00:07,760 --> 00:00:09,390
- It's hot. - By the way,

3
00:00:09,390 --> 00:00:11,160
the heatwave is really here.

4
00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:13,060
- It's so hot today. - The heatwave has struck.

5
00:00:13,060 --> 00:00:14,230
- Seriously. - I heard...

6
00:00:14,230 --> 00:00:16,560
- it'll be really hot this year. - It's so sunny in the afternoon.

7
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:18,400
- Jong Kook, nice pink shorts. - Right?

8
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:19,770
(Attracting attention)

9
00:00:20,500 --> 00:00:22,670
- I wear bright colors in summer. - Your pink shorts look nice.

10
00:00:22,670 --> 00:00:23,940
What happened?

11
00:00:23,940 --> 00:00:26,510
I wear bright-colored outfits in summer. I do.

12
00:00:26,510 --> 00:00:28,140
I was just complimenting you.

13
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:30,240
I think you were a eunuch in your previous life.

14
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:32,010
(I think you were a eunuch in your previous life.)

15
00:00:32,010 --> 00:00:33,110
- That's so true. - He was a traitor.

16
00:00:33,110 --> 00:00:35,050
- He had to be a traitor. Traitor. - A traitor.

17
00:00:35,080 --> 00:00:36,480
"Yes, Your Majesty."

18
00:00:37,420 --> 00:00:39,750
Since it's hot today, let's speed things up today.

19
00:00:39,750 --> 00:00:40,860
Okay!

20
00:00:40,860 --> 00:00:43,090
Before we start today, let me tell you...

21
00:00:43,090 --> 00:00:45,690
that we have invited guests who don't star on variety shows often.

22
00:00:45,690 --> 00:00:46,690
- Really? - Yes!

23
00:00:46,690 --> 00:00:49,000
(There are guests that are hard to see on variety shows?)

24
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,130
(We're having guests today!)

25
00:00:50,130 --> 00:00:51,130
Who are these guests?

26
00:00:51,130 --> 00:00:52,470
It will be different today.

27
00:00:52,470 --> 00:00:54,200
All right. Please come on out.

28
00:00:54,200 --> 00:00:55,240
- Where? - Where?

29
00:00:55,240 --> 00:00:58,740
(Who are today's guests?)

30
00:00:58,740 --> 00:01:00,010
Gosh, hey.

31
00:01:00,070 --> 00:01:01,640
- Goodness. - Hello.

32
00:01:01,640 --> 00:01:04,750
(Who are these guests that don't star on variety shows often?)

33
00:01:04,750 --> 00:01:06,210
(Four cast members from the movie, "Metamorphosis")

34
00:01:06,210 --> 00:01:07,280
Hello, sir.

35
00:01:07,380 --> 00:01:08,480
Gosh, hello.

36
00:01:08,480 --> 00:01:11,690
(Cho Yi Hyun, Sung Dong Il, Kim Hye Jun, Bae Seong Woo)

37
00:01:12,290 --> 00:01:13,490
(Welcome, cast of "Metamorphosis".)

38
00:01:13,490 --> 00:01:15,320
They are the main characters of the movie. Gosh, Dong Il.

39
00:01:15,320 --> 00:01:16,660
You haven't changed.

40
00:01:16,660 --> 00:01:18,590
- You're still so causal. - He's wearing a neon color.

41
00:01:18,590 --> 00:01:20,900
- Seong Woo is here. - My gosh.

42
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:22,060
Please come to the center.

43
00:01:22,060 --> 00:01:23,930
You should stand in the center.

44
00:01:23,930 --> 00:01:25,870
As for Dong Il, a long time ago, he was here...

45
00:01:25,870 --> 00:01:27,770
- for "The Accidental Detective". - Right.

46
00:01:27,770 --> 00:01:30,400
Of course. You were on our show quite a few times now.

47
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:32,510
- Right. It was because of him. - Exactly.

48
00:01:32,510 --> 00:01:34,280
It was when he filmed the movie with Kwang Soo.

49
00:01:34,280 --> 00:01:35,810
- Right. We had so much fun. - You were here for that.

50
00:01:35,980 --> 00:01:38,780
The movie would have done better if he wasn't in the movie.

51
00:01:38,780 --> 00:01:41,850
(He's being brutally honest all of a sudden.)

52
00:01:41,850 --> 00:01:43,280
(Feeling hurt)

53
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:44,290
Gosh.

54
00:01:45,090 --> 00:01:47,390
- Goodness. - He was acting just like...

55
00:01:47,390 --> 00:01:50,390
he was filming Running Man for our movie.

56
00:01:50,390 --> 00:01:51,960
Why did you do that?

57
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:53,590
- I tried to stop the director. - Exactly.

58
00:01:53,590 --> 00:01:55,800
- I told him it's either him or me. - That's why among entertainers,

59
00:01:55,800 --> 00:01:57,500
he's known as my junior comedian.

60
00:01:57,500 --> 00:01:59,400
We've been telling him to focus on just variety shows.

61
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:01,100
But he's not listening to me.

62
00:02:01,100 --> 00:02:03,740
I guess he gets offers from time to time.

63
00:02:03,740 --> 00:02:05,510
Just don't do anything, Kwang Soo.

64
00:02:05,510 --> 00:02:08,640
I'm meeting two people who can suffocate me the most in my life.

65
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:11,850
(I'm meeting two people who can suffocate me the most in my life.)

66
00:02:12,580 --> 00:02:14,150
- I'm about to lose it. - Really?

67
00:02:14,780 --> 00:02:17,250
All right. The four of them will be joining us today.

68
00:02:17,250 --> 00:02:20,790
First of all, he's been on our show several times now.

69
00:02:20,790 --> 00:02:22,090
It's Sung Dong Il.

70
00:02:22,090 --> 00:02:24,160
(Cherished national actor, Sung Dong Il)

71
00:02:24,290 --> 00:02:27,700
The movie is called "Metamorphosis". Please tell us about the movie.

72
00:02:27,860 --> 00:02:31,270
The devil is going to take turns possessing the entire family.

73
00:02:31,270 --> 00:02:32,270
You're possessed?

74
00:02:32,270 --> 00:02:34,040
Isn't that obvious? As for horror movies,

75
00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:36,670
when there are beautiful ladies like them, one of them...

76
00:02:36,670 --> 00:02:38,740
- will be in an accident. - Come on.

77
00:02:38,740 --> 00:02:39,870
- That's outdated. - That's not what it's about.

78
00:02:39,870 --> 00:02:41,380
- It's not like that these days. - It's not? I'm sorry.

79
00:02:41,380 --> 00:02:43,850
- First of all... Yes? - Seriously.

80
00:02:44,110 --> 00:02:46,250
He's lasted in this industry too long without any wits.

81
00:02:46,250 --> 00:02:48,280
(Launching his 2nd brutally honest comment)

82
00:02:49,050 --> 00:02:50,420
- Did you hear him? - Why would he say that?

83
00:02:50,420 --> 00:02:51,590
"Without any wits."

84
00:02:51,590 --> 00:02:54,020
He's talking about "Hometown Legends".

85
00:02:54,260 --> 00:02:55,490
I see. That was outdated.

86
00:02:55,490 --> 00:02:58,790
Few years back, he'd rush to me excited saying, "Hey, Dong Il!"

87
00:02:58,790 --> 00:03:01,600
But today, he came crawling over like this.

88
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:02,800
You should rest now.

89
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:04,100
(You should rest now.)

90
00:03:04,100 --> 00:03:05,600
Well, you're still working.

91
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:07,030
How can I rest?

92
00:03:07,030 --> 00:03:08,870
(Well, you're still working. How can I rest?)

93
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:10,840
You're still working.

94
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:13,170
Suk Jin is working so hard that he's skinning his knees.

95
00:03:13,170 --> 00:03:14,980
- Right. - Look at his knees.

96
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:17,110
All right. That was Dong Il's introduction.

97
00:03:17,110 --> 00:03:19,750
Now, let's move onto Bae Seong Woo.

98
00:03:19,750 --> 00:03:21,880
(The next guest, scene-stealer, Bae Seong Woo, is introduced.)

99
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:24,220
(All kinds of modifiers suit him.)

100
00:03:24,220 --> 00:03:27,020
(He's the actor with 1,000 faces the viewers have acknowledged.)

101
00:03:27,020 --> 00:03:29,460
(He's the sought-after actor in the movie industry...)

102
00:03:29,460 --> 00:03:31,890
(as he slowly stars in masterpiece movies.)

103
00:03:31,890 --> 00:03:36,060
(You'll find out his real charms on Running Man shortly!)

104
00:03:36,660 --> 00:03:40,870
(Look forward to his bromance with his best friend, Kwang Soo.)

105
00:03:41,100 --> 00:03:43,100
By the way, Seong Woo is friends with Kwang Soo too.

106
00:03:43,100 --> 00:03:44,670
- Yes, he is. - Right.

107
00:03:44,670 --> 00:03:47,940
The three of us have been close friends for several years now.

108
00:03:48,210 --> 00:03:50,080
- I see. - It's Seong Woo's interview.

109
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:52,650
All right. You debuted in a musical first?

110
00:03:53,210 --> 00:03:54,580
- He has a great voice. - He's a good singer.

111
00:03:54,580 --> 00:03:56,380
I didn't know he was good at singing.

112
00:03:56,380 --> 00:03:57,520
- He majored in ballet. - What?

113
00:03:57,520 --> 00:03:59,150
- Ballet? - You did ballet?

114
00:03:59,150 --> 00:04:00,520
- Yes. - He majored in ballet.

115
00:04:00,790 --> 00:04:02,420
- Then... - Why are you staring at me?

116
00:04:02,420 --> 00:04:03,520
Can you show us a little bit?

117
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:06,160
- I want to see him dance now. - I'm so curious.

118
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:07,230
You saw "Gisselle".

119
00:04:07,230 --> 00:04:09,260
- You know? - I can do this.

120
00:04:09,260 --> 00:04:11,400
(He gets into position. Is he doing a turn?)

121
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:16,770
(Looking sloppy)

122
00:04:16,770 --> 00:04:17,810
I'm sorry.

123
00:04:18,740 --> 00:04:20,510
(Oh, my...)

124
00:04:20,510 --> 00:04:21,510
This is grass.

125
00:04:21,510 --> 00:04:22,980
You could've done better without it.

126
00:04:22,980 --> 00:04:25,180
- He's not that talented. - Right.

127
00:04:25,180 --> 00:04:27,380
(He's not that talented.)

128
00:04:27,580 --> 00:04:29,520
- He's not that good. - That's why...

129
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:31,050
- I'm focusing on another area. - You majored in ballet?

130
00:04:31,050 --> 00:04:32,750
I just majored in theater acting.

131
00:04:32,750 --> 00:04:35,490
- He has ties to SBS too. - Right.

132
00:04:35,490 --> 00:04:36,860
- Right. - Of course, we know.

133
00:04:36,860 --> 00:04:39,290
- Bae Seong Jae is his brother. - Right.

134
00:04:39,290 --> 00:04:41,230
- Watch the World Cup on SBS. - Right.

135
00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:43,330
- That's amazing. - I was hired by SBS first too.

136
00:04:43,330 --> 00:04:44,330
- Oh, right. - Right!

137
00:04:44,330 --> 00:04:45,370
Really?

138
00:04:45,370 --> 00:04:47,370
- SBS hired him as an actor. - Right.

139
00:04:47,370 --> 00:04:48,470
- Really? - The first group of recruits.

140
00:04:48,470 --> 00:04:50,370
- I was the founding member. - Right.

141
00:04:50,370 --> 00:04:52,070
Who are some actors that were hired with you?

142
00:04:52,070 --> 00:04:54,140
Gong Hyung Jin started with me.

143
00:04:54,280 --> 00:04:56,640
- Oh Dae Gyu. - Oh Dae Gyu.

144
00:04:56,640 --> 00:04:58,050
I don't even know what they are up to.

145
00:04:58,050 --> 00:04:59,150
(Making a confession all of a sudden)

146
00:04:59,150 --> 00:05:01,150
- It's been so long. - But they were your colleagues.

147
00:05:01,150 --> 00:05:02,880
- I'm sure they are doing well. - Right.

148
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:05,320
- I hope they're healthy. - Right.

149
00:05:05,320 --> 00:05:08,060
We had brief introductions of these two guests now.

150
00:05:08,060 --> 00:05:11,290
They are new faces on our show. They'll join us today.

151
00:05:11,290 --> 00:05:14,000
Let me introduce Kim Hye Jun and Cho Yi Hyun to you.

152
00:05:14,330 --> 00:05:16,060
(Rising super rookies)

153
00:05:16,060 --> 00:05:17,300
(Cho Yi Hyun and Kim Hye Jun)

154
00:05:18,230 --> 00:05:22,500
(Kim Hye Jun, a rising new actress in the movie industry)

155
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:26,770
(Cho Yi Hyun, a real super rookie with a meteorite debut last year)

156
00:05:26,770 --> 00:05:28,640
(They are rising actresses to watch in the movie industry.)

157
00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:31,080
By the way, don't people mistake you two as sisters?

158
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:32,380
- You look alike. - You resemble each other.

159
00:05:32,380 --> 00:05:35,180
- You two look alike. - Right. We're sisters in the movie.

160
00:05:35,180 --> 00:05:36,180
They resemble each other.

161
00:05:36,180 --> 00:05:38,850
- That's why. Are you related? - They look so much alike.

162
00:05:38,850 --> 00:05:39,850
- No. - No.

163
00:05:39,850 --> 00:05:41,890
- You two resemble each other. - They have a similar image.

164
00:05:41,890 --> 00:05:44,790
Why are you guys chatting so much unlike during our introductions?

165
00:05:44,790 --> 00:05:47,030
(Why are you guys chatting so much unlike during our introductions?)

166
00:05:47,030 --> 00:05:48,660
- We're curious about them. - We're interested.

167
00:05:48,660 --> 00:05:50,230
- It means we're interested. - It's our first time meeting them.

168
00:05:50,230 --> 00:05:52,170
When you were walking down the stairs earlier,

169
00:05:52,170 --> 00:05:53,700
- we were only looking at them. - Right.

170
00:05:54,100 --> 00:05:55,140
I'm sorry.

171
00:05:55,140 --> 00:05:56,670
- Only they will go viral online. - That just means...

172
00:05:56,670 --> 00:05:58,770
- people are interested in them. - I was just stopping by too.

173
00:05:58,770 --> 00:06:00,010
I see.

174
00:06:00,010 --> 00:06:01,140
(Casually strolling his neighborhood)

175
00:06:01,140 --> 00:06:02,510
In today's race,

176
00:06:02,540 --> 00:06:04,410
deities have disguised themselves as humans.

177
00:06:04,410 --> 00:06:06,380
- It's a Metamorphosis Race. - Okay.

178
00:06:06,380 --> 00:06:11,590
Currently, three deities are hiding among you disguised as humans.

179
00:06:11,590 --> 00:06:14,590
(Three deities are disguised as humans.)

180
00:06:15,890 --> 00:06:17,630
It's not me. It's not me.

181
00:06:17,630 --> 00:06:18,890
- Is it you? - It's not me. I swear.

182
00:06:18,890 --> 00:06:20,160
I knew it.

183
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:22,200
- It's not me. It's really not me. - You, you.

184
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:24,100
- I bet it's one of them. - There are three?

185
00:06:24,370 --> 00:06:25,770
- I saw this coming. - It's 1 of the 2.

186
00:06:25,770 --> 00:06:27,200
- It's not me. It's not! - Hey, look.

187
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:28,970
Let me tell you about the deities.

188
00:06:29,170 --> 00:06:31,370
There's Hades, the deity of the afterlife, who was forced...

189
00:06:31,370 --> 00:06:33,870
to the underworld in the beginning of time where he ruled.

190
00:06:33,870 --> 00:06:36,980
He harbored ill feelings toward his brothers Zeus and Poseidon...

191
00:06:37,010 --> 00:06:38,880
and locked them up for eternity in the underworld.

192
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:41,220
To rule the world of the living, he's disguised himself as a human...

193
00:06:41,220 --> 00:06:42,220
and is hiding among you.

194
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:44,790
Zeus and Poseidon...

195
00:06:44,790 --> 00:06:47,860
are disguised as humans and are hiding here...

196
00:06:47,860 --> 00:06:50,120
to find Hades to send back to the underworld again.

197
00:06:50,390 --> 00:06:54,860
The three deities are Zeus, Poseidon, and Hades.

198
00:06:54,860 --> 00:06:57,700
Does that mean there's one villain who is Hades?

199
00:06:57,700 --> 00:06:59,230
The villain is Hades.

200
00:06:59,230 --> 00:07:01,770
For the sake of convenience, you'll address...

201
00:07:01,770 --> 00:07:03,370
everyone as brother, not sister.

202
00:07:03,370 --> 00:07:05,610
- Brother. We're all men. - Brother.

203
00:07:05,770 --> 00:07:08,840
Before Zeus and Poseidon get eliminated,

204
00:07:08,840 --> 00:07:11,180
you must help them and eliminate Hades to win.

205
00:07:11,180 --> 00:07:12,680
- There's Hades. - Hades.

206
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:15,580
However, if Hades finds out who Zeus and Poseidon are...

207
00:07:15,580 --> 00:07:17,690
and eliminates them first, Hades will win the race.

208
00:07:17,690 --> 00:07:20,790
And all of you will be dragged to the underworld.

209
00:07:21,260 --> 00:07:22,320
- Hades. - Hades.

210
00:07:22,320 --> 00:07:23,490
- "Ha"des? - What?

211
00:07:23,490 --> 00:07:25,430
- Haha. - Hades.

212
00:07:25,430 --> 00:07:26,960
- Hades? - I was the spy last week.

213
00:07:26,990 --> 00:07:28,400
Or is Jae Suk Zeus?

214
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:30,260
- Zeus? - Is Jae Suk Zeus?

215
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:34,240
He really must be Zeus. He's surprised.

216
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:36,700
- Do your ad-lib. - Say your ad-lib.

217
00:07:37,370 --> 00:07:38,410
It's not me.

218
00:07:38,410 --> 00:07:40,670
(Shaking like a tree)

219
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:42,880
- Your ad-lib is impressive. - Ad-lib.

220
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:44,280
- Did you see that? - He didn't ad-lib.

221
00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:46,550
- It's no joke. - It should go into a factory.

222
00:07:46,650 --> 00:07:49,580
Would Hades deliberately get caught?

223
00:07:49,580 --> 00:07:51,590
- Who? - I don't see why he would do that.

224
00:07:51,590 --> 00:07:53,220
- To end the filming quickly. - To go home early?

225
00:07:53,220 --> 00:07:55,120
- He wants to get off early. - Do you want to go home early?

226
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:57,860
Well, my wife told me to come home early today.

227
00:07:57,860 --> 00:07:58,890
Is he Hades?

228
00:07:58,890 --> 00:08:01,100
(I have to go home early today.)

229
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:02,330
Are you Hades?

230
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:03,530
- My house is not far from here. - Hades.

231
00:08:03,530 --> 00:08:04,700
She asked me why I'd be late.

232
00:08:04,730 --> 00:08:06,830
But I'm sure they already chose Hades.

233
00:08:06,830 --> 00:08:07,900
(It's 1 versus 11.)

234
00:08:07,900 --> 00:08:10,740
By the way, it will be so hard for Hades.

235
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:11,810
Right.

236
00:08:11,810 --> 00:08:13,140
I think you could be Hades.

237
00:08:13,140 --> 00:08:14,780
- No, that's not true. - I agree.

238
00:08:14,780 --> 00:08:15,940
He might be acting.

239
00:08:15,940 --> 00:08:17,710
(They move to another place for their first mission.)

240
00:08:19,780 --> 00:08:21,320
This is just like "Tray Karaoke".

241
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:23,180
I came in here because it's too hot outside.

242
00:08:23,180 --> 00:08:24,390
This place is cool.

243
00:08:24,750 --> 00:08:27,150
It's hot. This is "Tray Karaoke".

244
00:08:28,090 --> 00:08:29,360
When did So Min get here?

245
00:08:29,690 --> 00:08:30,930
Why are you here early?

246
00:08:30,930 --> 00:08:32,430
Me? Just because.

247
00:08:32,430 --> 00:08:34,330
- Hey, it's So Min. - She's...

248
00:08:34,330 --> 00:08:36,130
- Okay. - Seriously.

249
00:08:36,860 --> 00:08:38,070
It's just hot.

250
00:08:38,130 --> 00:08:39,230
It's just hot. You don't trust me?

251
00:08:39,300 --> 00:08:41,300
Hey. Se Chan, you don't believe me?

252
00:08:41,300 --> 00:08:42,300
- No. - Hey.

253
00:08:42,300 --> 00:08:43,600
- So Min. - Yes, Haha?

254
00:08:44,510 --> 00:08:45,670
That's not how you seduce men.

255
00:08:45,670 --> 00:08:47,810
(That's not how you seduce men.)

256
00:08:48,380 --> 00:08:49,610
Then how?

257
00:08:49,610 --> 00:08:50,840
Men won't fall for that.

258
00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:52,410
Don't be so aggressive.

259
00:08:52,410 --> 00:08:53,680
What should I do then?

260
00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:55,520
You should come up with an order first.

261
00:08:55,520 --> 00:08:56,650
Choose between Suk Jin and him first.

262
00:08:57,020 --> 00:08:58,990
(In that case, it's Se Chan.)

263
00:08:59,390 --> 00:09:00,490
Se Chan.

264
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:02,120
What?

265
00:09:02,790 --> 00:09:04,530
("Come here, Se Chan." She starts joking.)

266
00:09:04,530 --> 00:09:05,830
- What? - Come here.

267
00:09:06,090 --> 00:09:07,190
Hurry.

268
00:09:07,190 --> 00:09:08,460
Do I have to call you like this? Se Chan.

269
00:09:08,460 --> 00:09:09,960
(He's sick of her.)

270
00:09:10,430 --> 00:09:11,500
Stop it.

271
00:09:11,570 --> 00:09:13,300
Hey, I think it worked a bit.

272
00:09:13,300 --> 00:09:14,300
(Seeing his reaction)

273
00:09:14,500 --> 00:09:15,540
Se Chan.

274
00:09:15,540 --> 00:09:16,570
(Will this work?)

275
00:09:16,740 --> 00:09:18,740
Haha, what's wrong with her?

276
00:09:18,910 --> 00:09:21,140
Stop it. She went like this, "Se Chan".

277
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:23,380
How am I supposed to respond to that?

278
00:09:23,380 --> 00:09:24,850
Do I say, "Sure, So Min."

279
00:09:24,850 --> 00:09:27,010
- You should go to her. - Tell her to come to you.

280
00:09:27,180 --> 00:09:28,420
(You come here.)

281
00:09:29,820 --> 00:09:32,450
(Really? Okay, I'll get going now.)

282
00:09:32,450 --> 00:09:33,620
(Feeling the chills)

283
00:09:33,620 --> 00:09:35,590
- She's good. - Yes, she's good.

284
00:09:35,590 --> 00:09:37,490
- That was natural. - She's good.

285
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:39,860
(Their plot of love no one is interested in is over.)

286
00:09:39,860 --> 00:09:41,560
- Everyone is here, right? - Yes.

287
00:09:41,960 --> 00:09:43,360
Right before the cameras were rolling,

288
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:45,630
he said it's uncomfortable to hang out with Kwang Soo.

289
00:09:45,830 --> 00:09:47,600
He doesn't get why Kwang Soo wears masks.

290
00:09:48,140 --> 00:09:49,840
- Everyone can recognize it's him. - It's so obvious.

291
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:50,840
(No matter how much he covers up, it's him.)

292
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:52,040
Why do you do that, Kwang Soo?

293
00:09:52,040 --> 00:09:53,410
Hey, it's obvious.

294
00:09:53,410 --> 00:09:54,980
I can understand...

295
00:09:54,980 --> 00:09:56,510
- when D.O. does it. - D.O.

296
00:09:56,580 --> 00:09:58,250
Dong Il, do you know what's the funniest?

297
00:09:58,710 --> 00:10:00,650
They went to the airport and both wore masks.

298
00:10:01,020 --> 00:10:02,920
- Right. Right. - Jong Kook.

299
00:10:02,920 --> 00:10:04,350
- He was wearing a sleeveless top. - Yes, we did.

300
00:10:04,350 --> 00:10:06,790
He wore a sleeveless top and a mask.

301
00:10:06,920 --> 00:10:08,160
- Right. - That's funny.

302
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:09,860
(He can totally relate to it.)

303
00:10:10,690 --> 00:10:11,790
Have you worn a mask before?

304
00:10:11,790 --> 00:10:12,930
- Pardon? - Have you worn one?

305
00:10:12,930 --> 00:10:14,430
No, my respiratory system is weak.

306
00:10:14,430 --> 00:10:15,630
Your respiratory system is weak.

307
00:10:15,630 --> 00:10:17,160
(No, my respiratory system is weak.)

308
00:10:17,160 --> 00:10:18,530
(This manly guy has weak lung power.)

309
00:10:18,530 --> 00:10:19,870
I need to breathe in a lot of oxygen.

310
00:10:20,630 --> 00:10:22,040
We shouldn't laugh at this. It's true.

311
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:23,940
I need to take in big gulps of oxygen.

312
00:10:24,610 --> 00:10:25,910
His respiratory system is weak.

313
00:10:26,740 --> 00:10:28,440
All right. Here's your first mission.

314
00:10:28,740 --> 00:10:30,940
With this group mission, you can figure out who Hades is.

315
00:10:31,150 --> 00:10:32,950
It's called Stopping Means Death.

316
00:10:33,850 --> 00:10:36,850
You will choose six members to play each round...

317
00:10:36,850 --> 00:10:38,520
in order to complete your mission.

318
00:10:38,520 --> 00:10:40,790
As for your mission, you'll listen to the category we give you...

319
00:10:40,790 --> 00:10:43,460
and name one thing about the category one at a time.

320
00:10:43,460 --> 00:10:45,430
If the category is girl group,

321
00:10:45,430 --> 00:10:47,590
- you'll name girl groups. - Right.

322
00:10:47,700 --> 00:10:49,230
- Everyone will name one. - GFRIEND.

323
00:10:49,230 --> 00:10:50,760
GFRIEND. Did you understand?

324
00:10:50,860 --> 00:10:52,500
- I'm good at this. - I'm good at this.

325
00:10:52,870 --> 00:10:54,170
Hye Jun and Yi Hyun, you understood it, right?

326
00:10:54,170 --> 00:10:55,870
- Of course. - They'll be so good.

327
00:10:55,870 --> 00:10:57,570
(They confidently answered it, but they are worried.)

328
00:10:57,570 --> 00:10:59,110
If you successfully complete three or more rounds,

329
00:10:59,110 --> 00:11:02,610
all 12 of you will receive a hint about Hades.

330
00:11:04,040 --> 00:11:05,550
Everyone will get the hint?

331
00:11:05,650 --> 00:11:07,010
We have to complete the mission.

332
00:11:07,280 --> 00:11:09,020
All right. Here's your category for the first round.

333
00:11:09,020 --> 00:11:11,850
- We'll see who gets it wrong. - We'll see who gets it wrong.

334
00:11:12,090 --> 00:11:13,850
Here's the first keyword.

335
00:11:14,050 --> 00:11:15,820
Stopping Means Death.

336
00:11:16,220 --> 00:11:17,860
Famous figures with four-syllable names.

337
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:19,990
- King Sejong. - Madame Curie.

338
00:11:21,100 --> 00:11:22,330
- What king? - Four-syllable name...

339
00:11:24,300 --> 00:11:26,900
(He's taking his time.)

340
00:11:27,170 --> 00:11:29,100
(They are surprised.)

341
00:11:29,270 --> 00:11:31,110
- Dong Il, there are a lot. - Gosh.

342
00:11:31,110 --> 00:11:32,940
- Eulji Mundeok. Sunwoo Jae Duk. - Madame Curie?

343
00:11:32,940 --> 00:11:34,040
Sunwoo Jae Duk?

344
00:11:34,140 --> 00:11:35,410
Seonwoo Yong Nyeo.

345
00:11:35,410 --> 00:11:37,140
Jae Duk is alive now.

346
00:11:37,140 --> 00:11:39,110
- Eulji Mundeok. - He's very active now.

347
00:11:39,450 --> 00:11:40,650
That startled me.

348
00:11:40,710 --> 00:11:41,780
Napoleon.

349
00:11:41,780 --> 00:11:42,880
Should we count that as a failed round?

350
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:44,350
Or should we play another practice round?

351
00:11:44,350 --> 00:11:45,850
- Practice round. - Practice round.

352
00:11:45,990 --> 00:11:47,090
Practice round.

353
00:11:47,520 --> 00:11:48,790
- Let's switch. - Dong Il.

354
00:11:48,790 --> 00:11:50,390
Why don't you sit at the end?

355
00:11:50,390 --> 00:11:51,990
Dong Il, you can go last.

356
00:11:51,990 --> 00:11:53,590
- Or you can go 1st. - Going 1st is fine.

357
00:11:53,590 --> 00:11:55,060
- Dong ll, you can go 1st. - Going 1st would be nice.

358
00:11:55,060 --> 00:11:56,630
- First? - You can have time to prepare.

359
00:11:56,630 --> 00:11:58,500
- Going second would be better. - They will give us enough time.

360
00:11:58,500 --> 00:12:00,270
- Dong Il, you can go last. - Why don't you go first?

361
00:12:00,270 --> 00:12:01,940
Am I that much of an issue?

362
00:12:01,940 --> 00:12:04,200
(Am I that much of an issue?)

363
00:12:04,840 --> 00:12:05,840
It's not that.

364
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:07,010
- That's not why. - No, no.

365
00:12:07,010 --> 00:12:08,410
- It's a practice round. - You can just try it out.

366
00:12:08,410 --> 00:12:09,810
Why don't you take me out then?

367
00:12:09,810 --> 00:12:10,980
- No. You can play. - No.

368
00:12:11,310 --> 00:12:13,080
Don't be upset. It's not that.

369
00:12:13,080 --> 00:12:14,480
It's our strategy. It's a strategy.

370
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:17,120
If someone else says first whatever he was preparing to say...

371
00:12:17,850 --> 00:12:19,320
All right. I'll start.

372
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:20,720
- I'll give you an easy one. - Okay.

373
00:12:21,090 --> 00:12:23,020
Stopping Means Death.

374
00:12:23,290 --> 00:12:25,330
Four-syllable Korean movies.

375
00:12:25,330 --> 00:12:28,160
(Four-syllable Korean movies)

376
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:29,400
Hold on.

377
00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:30,760
(His time is up.)

378
00:12:31,730 --> 00:12:33,500
(They lose the 1st round.)

379
00:12:33,500 --> 00:12:35,270
- Hey, this one hurt so much. - It really hurt.

380
00:12:35,270 --> 00:12:36,840
- My gosh. - I was so startled.

381
00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:38,640
- What's this? - Look at him.

382
00:12:38,640 --> 00:12:40,310
Hey, Dong Il is angry now!

383
00:12:40,310 --> 00:12:41,680
- Are you all right? - It really hurt.

384
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:42,880
This one really hurt.

385
00:12:43,140 --> 00:12:44,410
- What was up with that? - Listen.

386
00:12:44,510 --> 00:12:46,450
I think the viewers should know how much it hurts too.

387
00:12:46,450 --> 00:12:47,550
(Anyway, as Seong Woo stalled, they lost the 1st round.)

388
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:50,120
- Why don't the six of us try next? - We'll try it.

389
00:12:50,420 --> 00:12:52,190
- Seong Woo will play again. - What are some movies?

390
00:12:52,290 --> 00:12:54,290
- Here's the thing. - Let's make him play again.

391
00:12:54,290 --> 00:12:56,660
- He's filmed so many movies. - He'll play again.

392
00:12:56,660 --> 00:12:57,760
- He was the main lead too. - That was a bit fishy.

393
00:12:57,760 --> 00:12:59,030
- That is odd. - I see.

394
00:12:59,030 --> 00:13:00,230
- He was in "Inside Men". - He'll play one more round.

395
00:13:00,230 --> 00:13:01,560
There aren't that many four-syllable movies.

396
00:13:01,560 --> 00:13:03,530
- No, there are a lot. - "Peppermint Candy".

397
00:13:03,530 --> 00:13:04,800
- The six of us will play. - Right.

398
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:06,970
- "The Unjust". "Inside Men". - "Along with the Gods".

399
00:13:06,970 --> 00:13:08,470
- Right. - "Along with the Gods".

400
00:13:09,140 --> 00:13:10,840
- My movies have four syllables. - There were a lot.

401
00:13:10,840 --> 00:13:12,270
(Was that a mistake? Or did he do it on purpose?)

402
00:13:12,270 --> 00:13:13,840
- In which order should we sit? - Hey, I'll go first.

403
00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:15,240
- Come on. - I want to see him play again.

404
00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:16,610
What do you think?

405
00:13:16,610 --> 00:13:19,010
We'll start now. No practice rounds. We'll start right away.

406
00:13:19,010 --> 00:13:21,350
Hey, you have to ad-lib this.

407
00:13:21,450 --> 00:13:22,580
Jae Suk and his ad-lib.

408
00:13:22,750 --> 00:13:24,550
- He's going to have fun with it. - Watch.

409
00:13:24,550 --> 00:13:26,350
- It's perfect if he goes second. - I'll do it with my ad-lib.

410
00:13:27,290 --> 00:13:29,120
Hey, let's switch places. I'll take your place.

411
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:30,460
(That was sudden.)

412
00:13:30,820 --> 00:13:32,090
- Why? - Why?

413
00:13:32,090 --> 00:13:34,660
- Have fun with the ad-lib. - Go back to your seat.

414
00:13:34,660 --> 00:13:36,230
- Go sit down. - Magician of language.

415
00:13:36,230 --> 00:13:37,360
Okay.

416
00:13:37,530 --> 00:13:40,070
- Hye Jun. Yi Hyun. Watch me. - Okay.

417
00:13:40,070 --> 00:13:41,540
- Watch, Seong Woo. - We'll watch you.

418
00:13:41,700 --> 00:13:42,770
Here we go.

419
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,940
Stopping Means Death.

420
00:13:44,940 --> 00:13:46,110
Male idol stars.

421
00:13:46,540 --> 00:13:47,570
BTOB.

422
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:50,010
- Cool. - Kwang Soo.

423
00:13:51,250 --> 00:13:53,280
(It's a mixed group, and his time was up.)

424
00:13:53,280 --> 00:13:54,750
- Hey. - Cool?

425
00:13:54,850 --> 00:13:57,050
- Hey. It's not just two guys. - Cool isn't a male group.

426
00:13:57,120 --> 00:13:58,550
- Cool? - It's a mixed group.

427
00:13:58,550 --> 00:14:00,090
- Hey. Cool? - I didn't do it on purpose.

428
00:14:00,090 --> 00:14:01,420
- Cool? - I mean...

429
00:14:01,620 --> 00:14:03,820
There are BTS and EXO.

430
00:14:03,820 --> 00:14:05,160
- There's Turbo too. - EXO...

431
00:14:05,430 --> 00:14:06,760
- I just couldn't remember it. - Something is off about you.

432
00:14:06,760 --> 00:14:08,060
- BTS. - I'm serious.

433
00:14:08,060 --> 00:14:09,560
- There's no way. It was too easy. - EXO.

434
00:14:09,560 --> 00:14:10,860
- Something's off about him. - I admit that I made a mistake.

435
00:14:10,860 --> 00:14:12,130
- Highlight. - Jae Suk.

436
00:14:12,130 --> 00:14:14,130
Kwang Soo has ties with the guests today.

437
00:14:14,130 --> 00:14:16,100
- It's likely that it's him. - That makes sense.

438
00:14:16,100 --> 00:14:17,940
- That's not it. - He's helping like an assistant.

439
00:14:18,210 --> 00:14:20,210
Before we move on, Kwang Soo will get the tray.

440
00:14:20,310 --> 00:14:21,740
- Why didn't you get hit? - It didn't hit him.

441
00:14:21,740 --> 00:14:23,310
- The tray didn't hit him. - Why?

442
00:14:23,310 --> 00:14:24,680
Okay. I'll do it.

443
00:14:25,750 --> 00:14:27,750
(A while ago, he said Cool.)

444
00:14:29,380 --> 00:14:32,320
(He avoided the tray by lowering his head.)

445
00:14:33,090 --> 00:14:35,960
(And he starts acting like it hurt.)

446
00:14:35,960 --> 00:14:37,260
(He dreamed of the perfect crime.)

447
00:14:37,260 --> 00:14:38,630
- Why didn't he get hit? - It didn't hit him.

448
00:14:38,630 --> 00:14:40,030
- Right. - Why didn't that hit Kwang Soo?

449
00:14:40,030 --> 00:14:42,560
I saw it. He had his head jutted out, so he didn't get it.

450
00:14:42,830 --> 00:14:44,870
No. Lower it. I'll do it for Kwang Soo.

451
00:14:44,870 --> 00:14:46,070
(Stepping in all of a sudden)

452
00:14:46,170 --> 00:14:47,500
- How? - Lower it.

453
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:48,800
Lower it just as it is.

454
00:14:48,970 --> 00:14:50,070
Lower it.

455
00:14:50,370 --> 00:14:51,710
- How will he... - Lower it more.

456
00:14:51,710 --> 00:14:52,910
- How will he do that? - Lower it more.

457
00:14:52,910 --> 00:14:54,010
- You must lower it more. - Lower it more.

458
00:14:54,010 --> 00:14:55,480
That's good. I'll punish Kwang Soo.

459
00:14:55,480 --> 00:14:56,780
(The righteous man came to punish Kwang Soo for his trickery.)

460
00:14:56,780 --> 00:14:57,780
Here I go.

461
00:14:58,650 --> 00:15:00,080
(Just tray)

462
00:15:01,780 --> 00:15:03,420
(He's totally startled.)

463
00:15:03,880 --> 00:15:05,050
(That hits the spot for everyone.)

464
00:15:05,050 --> 00:15:06,320
Great.

465
00:15:06,450 --> 00:15:08,420
- Kwang Soo, that's how you do it. - Kwang Soo.

466
00:15:08,420 --> 00:15:10,960
Hey, compared to him, I'm such a nice guy.

467
00:15:11,290 --> 00:15:12,990
- Hey, he's... - Let me explain.

468
00:15:13,330 --> 00:15:16,400
Even other female members faced the trays.

469
00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:18,300
But he's the tallest one...

470
00:15:18,300 --> 00:15:19,870
and dodged like this to avoid the tray.

471
00:15:20,470 --> 00:15:22,040
- Right. - It's as if...

472
00:15:22,040 --> 00:15:24,000
he knew that he was going to get it wrong.

473
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,510
(Thinking back, he knew he'd get it wrong.)

474
00:15:25,510 --> 00:15:27,440
(That makes sense.)

475
00:15:27,910 --> 00:15:29,710
It was an honest mistake.

476
00:15:29,880 --> 00:15:31,510
Kwang Soo is usually good at these kinds of games.

477
00:15:31,510 --> 00:15:33,380
- Kwang Soo, you stay. - It was a mistake.

478
00:15:33,380 --> 00:15:36,080
- I think Dong Il should play. - Okay. Come, Dong Il.

479
00:15:36,220 --> 00:15:39,220
But in my opinion, I don't think he's Hades.

480
00:15:39,220 --> 00:15:40,720
He didn't understand them at first.

481
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:42,760
- Suk Jin, okay. Sit down. - Me?

482
00:15:42,760 --> 00:15:44,560
(He's not even listening to Suk Jin.)

483
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:46,360
(Me?)

484
00:15:46,360 --> 00:15:48,000
Why aren't you listening to what I have to say?

485
00:15:49,060 --> 00:15:50,860
We're trying to figure out who it is with my sharp reasoning skills.

486
00:15:52,300 --> 00:15:54,230
Here's your category.

487
00:15:54,870 --> 00:15:57,470
- Stopping Means Death. - Stopping Means Death.

488
00:15:57,570 --> 00:15:58,840
A noodle dish.

489
00:15:59,340 --> 00:16:00,740
- Guksu. - Jjajangmyeon.

490
00:16:00,940 --> 00:16:02,210
Jjapaghetti.

491
00:16:02,210 --> 00:16:03,780
(His time runs out.)

492
00:16:04,080 --> 00:16:05,210
That was a strong one.

493
00:16:05,210 --> 00:16:06,610
(Kwang Soo gets it wrong again.)

494
00:16:07,150 --> 00:16:08,480
- Hey... - Gosh.

495
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:09,720
(Gosh, I'm doomed.)

496
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:11,850
- There's kalguksu too. - Exactly.

497
00:16:11,850 --> 00:16:13,850
- There are so many noodles dishes. - There are so many.

498
00:16:13,850 --> 00:16:15,120
- Pyeongyang naengmyeon. - Listen.

499
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:17,520
When Seong Woo said jjajangmyeon, you should say jjamppong.

500
00:16:17,520 --> 00:16:19,330
- I was thinking of jjajangmyeon. - There are more.

501
00:16:19,330 --> 00:16:21,400
- It's not that. I'm not Hades. - Bibimguksu too.

502
00:16:21,400 --> 00:16:22,600
I'm just bad at this game.

503
00:16:22,760 --> 00:16:25,270
Even if you are Hades,

504
00:16:25,470 --> 00:16:26,800
you're ruining the show.

505
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:29,070
(Even if you are Hades, you're ruining the show.)

506
00:16:29,270 --> 00:16:30,740
- You're ruining it. - I'm not Hades.

507
00:16:30,840 --> 00:16:32,270
- I'm not ruining the show. - No.

508
00:16:32,270 --> 00:16:34,170
I'm sorry. I shouldn't have said jjajangmyeon.

509
00:16:34,540 --> 00:16:35,680
You were preparing to say that.

510
00:16:35,940 --> 00:16:37,940
I'm sorry. Sorry.

511
00:16:39,150 --> 00:16:41,050
- He's nice. - He's taking care of Kwang Soo.

512
00:16:41,150 --> 00:16:42,250
He's a good guy.

513
00:16:42,250 --> 00:16:43,580
He wants to look cool by himself.

514
00:16:43,580 --> 00:16:44,620
(Unbelievable)

515
00:16:45,220 --> 00:16:47,450
There are more than three Hades in this group.

516
00:16:48,220 --> 00:16:49,560
It's really not me.

517
00:16:49,760 --> 00:16:52,190
- Seong Woo. Kwang Soo, and Dong Il. - Yes.

518
00:16:52,360 --> 00:16:54,260
All right. Everyone, come on out.

519
00:16:54,260 --> 00:16:56,260
- Come on out. - "Come on out."

520
00:16:56,360 --> 00:16:57,460
Here we go.

521
00:16:57,800 --> 00:16:59,430
- Let's complete three rounds. - Okay.

522
00:16:59,530 --> 00:17:01,670
- Stopping Means Death. - Stopping Means Death.

523
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:05,870
Films with numbers in their titles.

524
00:17:06,610 --> 00:17:07,840
"Seven".

525
00:17:08,440 --> 00:17:09,540
"Eight".

526
00:17:11,140 --> 00:17:14,180
(He says eight after hearing "Seven" without thinking.)

527
00:17:14,180 --> 00:17:15,250
- Eight? - That was awful.

528
00:17:15,250 --> 00:17:16,820
- There's "No. 3". - That was...

529
00:17:16,820 --> 00:17:18,320
- Something is off about him. - There's "Seventeen" too.

530
00:17:18,820 --> 00:17:20,420
- I... - "Ocean's Eleven".

531
00:17:20,520 --> 00:17:21,990
- Hey, hold on. - I mean...

532
00:17:21,990 --> 00:17:23,320
- What's wrong with you? - Wait.

533
00:17:23,320 --> 00:17:24,590
- Hey. - He's terrible.

534
00:17:24,590 --> 00:17:26,530
Do you get nervous when you get the question?

535
00:17:26,630 --> 00:17:29,060
You're the most famous host. Why are you nervous?

536
00:17:29,230 --> 00:17:31,160
The keyword was something I didn't see coming.

537
00:17:31,730 --> 00:17:32,930
I'm so shocked.

538
00:17:32,930 --> 00:17:34,030
Here we go.

539
00:17:34,230 --> 00:17:35,740
- Let's complete three rounds. - Okay.

540
00:17:35,740 --> 00:17:37,370
- Let's not say the same answer. - This group...

541
00:17:37,370 --> 00:17:38,610
Should I go last?

542
00:17:39,610 --> 00:17:40,910
- Why? Are you nervous? - I mean...

543
00:17:40,910 --> 00:17:42,840
Isn't it better for people who aren't good at this to go first?

544
00:17:42,840 --> 00:17:45,150
- That's why you're there. - That's why you're there.

545
00:17:45,150 --> 00:17:46,750
Do you not know why you're going second?

546
00:17:46,980 --> 00:17:48,150
Goodness.

547
00:17:48,450 --> 00:17:50,080
You indeed have the best ad-libs.

548
00:17:51,350 --> 00:17:52,720
- Seong Woo, pay attention now. - Okay.

549
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:56,120
- He should switch with Ji Hyo. - Okay.

550
00:17:56,120 --> 00:17:57,320
(People who aren't good at this will go first.)

551
00:17:57,860 --> 00:17:59,090
- We'll start now. - If I screw up,

552
00:17:59,090 --> 00:18:00,090
you can think that I'm Hades.

553
00:18:00,260 --> 00:18:02,060
- Okay. - Let's enunciate well.

554
00:18:02,330 --> 00:18:05,000
Stopping Means Death.

555
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:08,100
Words with the sound for double b's.

556
00:18:08,100 --> 00:18:09,470
- Double b's. - Double b's?

557
00:18:09,470 --> 00:18:10,470
Bread.

558
00:18:10,470 --> 00:18:11,570
"Papillon".

559
00:18:11,570 --> 00:18:12,640
"Mulberry".

560
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:14,010
(For the 1st time, all 3 of them get it right.)

561
00:18:14,010 --> 00:18:16,810
(Now, there are only 3 more left.)

562
00:18:17,510 --> 00:18:18,550
Honk, honk.

563
00:18:18,550 --> 00:18:20,350
(He gets it wrong.)

564
00:18:20,580 --> 00:18:22,420
(Shouting)

565
00:18:23,220 --> 00:18:25,190
- What was that? - Come on.

566
00:18:25,190 --> 00:18:26,190
(What was that?)

567
00:18:26,190 --> 00:18:27,390
(Dong Il gets it wrong.)

568
00:18:27,390 --> 00:18:28,390
"Honk, honk"?

569
00:18:28,390 --> 00:18:29,620
(What was that?)

570
00:18:29,620 --> 00:18:31,630
That really hurts. I'm dizzy.

571
00:18:31,630 --> 00:18:32,990
- Isn't that okay? - That was a car sound.

572
00:18:32,990 --> 00:18:34,230
- Honk, honk. - Yes.

573
00:18:34,230 --> 00:18:35,300
You can't do that.

574
00:18:35,300 --> 00:18:37,160
- I can't? - Isn't it in the dictionary?

575
00:18:37,160 --> 00:18:38,500
- Right, it is. - Honk, honk.

576
00:18:38,500 --> 00:18:39,830
It's an actual word?

577
00:18:39,830 --> 00:18:41,640
- They have the word. - Yes.

578
00:18:41,640 --> 00:18:43,870
Don't they have it?

579
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,270
- Honk, honk. - Isn't it?

580
00:18:45,270 --> 00:18:46,710
- Isn't it in the dictionary? - Honk, honk.

581
00:18:46,710 --> 00:18:47,910
- All right. - I'm right, right?

582
00:18:47,910 --> 00:18:49,540
If you can tell me the meaning, then I'll understand.

583
00:18:49,540 --> 00:18:50,910
- Are you serious? - Hey.

584
00:18:50,910 --> 00:18:52,010
(It's in the dictionary.)

585
00:18:52,010 --> 00:18:53,550
- It is? - My gosh.

586
00:18:53,550 --> 00:18:55,280
- Tell them the definition. - What?

587
00:18:55,280 --> 00:18:57,650
- I think I know this one. - Isn't this it?

588
00:18:57,650 --> 00:18:59,490
It means you're happy.

589
00:18:59,790 --> 00:19:01,890
- No, it's not that one. - No?

590
00:19:02,260 --> 00:19:04,260
- It's... - He just told him off.

591
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:06,390
Honk, honk.

592
00:19:06,990 --> 00:19:08,960
(Honk, honk)

593
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:11,260
Wait, so it's in the dictionary.

594
00:19:11,630 --> 00:19:15,100
- You can give a similar meaning. - Just tell them.

595
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:18,510
It's related to a government office.

596
00:19:18,840 --> 00:19:21,310
- Honk, honk? - Yes, it's related...

597
00:19:21,310 --> 00:19:23,980
to a government office.

598
00:19:23,980 --> 00:19:25,650
- Right. - A government office?

599
00:19:25,650 --> 00:19:29,280
It's related to government offices.

600
00:19:29,320 --> 00:19:31,820
(He got lucky with the word.)

601
00:19:31,820 --> 00:19:34,720
(Will Dong Il be able to get it right?)

602
00:19:35,390 --> 00:19:36,460
It's wrong?

603
00:19:36,460 --> 00:19:40,190
It means "the honking of a vehicle".

604
00:19:41,800 --> 00:19:44,630
(The honking of a vehicle)

605
00:19:44,630 --> 00:19:46,570
You should've said that!

606
00:19:46,800 --> 00:19:48,200
Why did you say that?

607
00:19:49,070 --> 00:19:50,800
(They tricked him.)

608
00:19:50,800 --> 00:19:52,040
My gosh.

609
00:19:52,040 --> 00:19:53,640
- Why did you say that? - Does his word exist?

610
00:19:54,770 --> 00:19:56,810
He could've just said the honking of a car.

611
00:19:57,440 --> 00:19:58,780
Why did you say that?

612
00:19:58,780 --> 00:20:00,510
It's the sound of a vehicle.

613
00:20:00,850 --> 00:20:02,450
- Everyone. - We were right.

614
00:20:02,450 --> 00:20:03,520
This is your last chance.

615
00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:05,850
Please choose your teammates carefully.

616
00:20:05,850 --> 00:20:07,290
Let's form a competent team.

617
00:20:07,290 --> 00:20:09,620
Okay. Let's pick only the best ones.

618
00:20:09,620 --> 00:20:11,120
- Suk Jin, come out. - Okay.

619
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:12,990
Hold on. Jae Suk, come here.

620
00:20:12,990 --> 00:20:14,930
- Go. - Don't try to join them.

621
00:20:14,930 --> 00:20:16,430
I'll keep him in check.

622
00:20:16,630 --> 00:20:17,900
Here we go.

623
00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:20,000
Please let it be easy.

624
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,400
All right. This will be an easy one.

625
00:20:22,540 --> 00:20:25,540
Stopping Means Death.

626
00:20:25,540 --> 00:20:26,740
An actor's name.

627
00:20:26,740 --> 00:20:27,970
(An actor's name)

628
00:20:27,970 --> 00:20:29,110
Sung Dong Il.

629
00:20:31,040 --> 00:20:32,080
Bae Seong Woo.

630
00:20:32,810 --> 00:20:34,110
- What are you doing? - Lee Kwang Soo!

631
00:20:34,780 --> 00:20:35,850
She got this wrong?

632
00:20:36,220 --> 00:20:37,720
(She runs out of time.)

633
00:20:37,720 --> 00:20:39,450
- What was that? - Hold on.

634
00:20:39,450 --> 00:20:41,620
- You failed? - This makes no sense.

635
00:20:41,620 --> 00:20:43,460
- She's so strange. - She is...

636
00:20:43,490 --> 00:20:44,990
- She's definitely Hades. - No, wait.

637
00:20:44,990 --> 00:20:46,890
- What is this? - There are many names.

638
00:20:46,890 --> 00:20:48,230
There are many actors.

639
00:20:48,230 --> 00:20:50,230
- There are so many actors. - There's Won Bin.

640
00:20:50,330 --> 00:20:51,600
All right, Yi Hyun.

641
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:52,630
(She's an actress herself.)

642
00:20:52,630 --> 00:20:55,040
I have my doubts, but we'll move on.

643
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:57,100
- Goodness. - Did we fail?

644
00:20:57,100 --> 00:20:58,140
I caught you.

645
00:20:58,340 --> 00:21:02,080
You failed round one.

646
00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:04,710
We will not give you a hint regarding Hades.

647
00:21:04,710 --> 00:21:07,710
(They fail to acquire a hint about Hades.)

648
00:21:07,710 --> 00:21:09,080
There are so many actors.

649
00:21:09,080 --> 00:21:10,780
I was too nervous.

650
00:21:10,780 --> 00:21:12,120
Forget it.

651
00:21:12,120 --> 00:21:14,290
We'll have some time to think about this.

652
00:21:14,290 --> 00:21:16,660
Jae Suk, you're the second-most suspicious.

653
00:21:16,990 --> 00:21:18,990
- And you're the third. - You're the third.

654
00:21:19,590 --> 00:21:21,460
I'm seriously innocent.

655
00:21:21,460 --> 00:21:24,130
- Aren't you hungry? - Yes.

656
00:21:24,130 --> 00:21:27,530
For this mission, a hint and a meal card will be given.

657
00:21:27,530 --> 00:21:29,670
(A hint and a meal card will be given.)

658
00:21:30,340 --> 00:21:32,240
- It's called Eat Up. - Eat Up?

659
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:33,610
(Eat Up)

660
00:21:33,740 --> 00:21:36,710
You'll be divided into 2 teams of 6.

661
00:21:36,710 --> 00:21:38,850
Please split into teams first.

662
00:21:38,850 --> 00:21:40,350
Should we use the spoons?

663
00:21:40,350 --> 00:21:41,380
It's a battle.

664
00:21:41,380 --> 00:21:43,020
I hope we don't get all the weak members.

665
00:21:43,020 --> 00:21:44,580
Please pick one each.

666
00:21:44,580 --> 00:21:46,720
- Here. - Ji Hyo.

667
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:47,850
Suk Jin.

668
00:21:48,020 --> 00:21:50,490
- I've already made a choice. - Okay.

669
00:21:50,490 --> 00:21:52,360
Please stand with your teammates.

670
00:21:52,360 --> 00:21:53,930
(Team Dong Il, Team Seong Woo)

671
00:21:54,360 --> 00:21:56,930
We have two candidates who are suspicious of being Hades.

672
00:21:56,930 --> 00:21:58,470
Goodness.

673
00:21:58,470 --> 00:21:59,770
- There are 3. - There are 3.

674
00:21:59,770 --> 00:22:02,500
- All of them are there. - You're right.

675
00:22:03,170 --> 00:22:05,140
- They're all here. - My gosh.

676
00:22:05,140 --> 00:22:06,170
All of them are here.

677
00:22:06,170 --> 00:22:08,310
- We need to prove them wrong. - Right.

678
00:22:08,310 --> 00:22:09,480
We'll find out who it is.

679
00:22:09,480 --> 00:22:11,140
All three of them are here.

680
00:22:11,140 --> 00:22:12,850
(However)

681
00:22:13,150 --> 00:22:15,250
I'm glad we can eat.

682
00:22:15,250 --> 00:22:17,420
While eating, the winning team...

683
00:22:17,420 --> 00:22:20,350
can pick which one of you will receive...

684
00:22:20,650 --> 00:22:24,260
a hint about Hades and the brother deities.

685
00:22:24,620 --> 00:22:28,090
But shouldn't the Hades candidates not receive the hints?

686
00:22:28,090 --> 00:22:29,360
- You're right. - And who are they?

687
00:22:29,830 --> 00:22:31,000
You.

688
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:32,870
And Yi Hyun.

689
00:22:32,870 --> 00:22:34,600
It's really not me.

690
00:22:34,600 --> 00:22:36,740
We have so many candidates on our team.

691
00:22:36,740 --> 00:22:39,810
How about the one with the best leadership receive the hint?

692
00:22:39,810 --> 00:22:42,180
- For example, Jong Kook. - But this is an individual battle.

693
00:22:42,440 --> 00:22:45,150
- I see. - So there's no teamwork.

694
00:22:45,150 --> 00:22:47,610
If you can't pick yet,

695
00:22:47,750 --> 00:22:49,520
since Seong Woo is bored,

696
00:22:49,620 --> 00:22:51,450
we'll play rock-paper-scissors with him.

697
00:22:51,450 --> 00:22:54,120
Whoever plays the same hand as him will be eliminated.

698
00:22:54,120 --> 00:22:55,960
- All right. - The remaining one will...

699
00:22:55,960 --> 00:22:57,790
I haven't eaten yet. Is this necessary?

700
00:22:57,790 --> 00:23:00,290
(What was that?)

701
00:23:00,530 --> 00:23:01,900
Come on, be easy on him.

702
00:23:01,900 --> 00:23:03,300
You should do something productive.

703
00:23:03,300 --> 00:23:05,770
If he does it right,

704
00:23:05,770 --> 00:23:07,300
- give him some food. - I will.

705
00:23:07,300 --> 00:23:08,400
Yes, do so.

706
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:09,740
(That's great.)

707
00:23:09,740 --> 00:23:12,470
- If you work a bit... - Work a bit?

708
00:23:12,470 --> 00:23:14,740
If you play the same hand as him,

709
00:23:14,810 --> 00:23:16,040
you'll be eliminated.

710
00:23:16,040 --> 00:23:17,110
(Whoever plays the same hand loses.)

711
00:23:17,110 --> 00:23:19,310
Rock-paper-scissors with Bae Seong Woo.

712
00:23:19,310 --> 00:23:20,980
(Seong Woo plays scissors.)

713
00:23:20,980 --> 00:23:22,750
- If you have scissors, you lose. - Okay.

714
00:23:22,750 --> 00:23:24,280
- If you have scissors, you lose. - It's us three.

715
00:23:24,280 --> 00:23:25,620
Yes.

716
00:23:25,620 --> 00:23:27,190
Rock-paper-scissors.

717
00:23:27,190 --> 00:23:28,350
(Seong Woo plays paper.)

718
00:23:28,350 --> 00:23:30,090
One more time. Rock-paper-scissors.

719
00:23:30,090 --> 00:23:32,060
(Seong Woo plays rock.)

720
00:23:32,060 --> 00:23:33,190
(He's the only survivor.)

721
00:23:33,960 --> 00:23:36,030
(Se Chan is the survivor.)

722
00:23:36,030 --> 00:23:38,130
(Bring the hint to me.)

723
00:23:38,130 --> 00:23:39,600
- Se Chan's Hades. - He is.

724
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:40,770
No way.

725
00:23:40,770 --> 00:23:42,200
I doubt he is.

726
00:23:42,200 --> 00:23:45,170
But I bet he'll give Hades critical information,

727
00:23:45,170 --> 00:23:46,540
thinking Hades is on his side.

728
00:23:46,540 --> 00:23:47,540
(There's a 200-percent chance of that happening.)

729
00:23:47,540 --> 00:23:49,140
You're right.

730
00:23:49,140 --> 00:23:51,140
- He tends to do that. - You're right.

731
00:23:51,810 --> 00:23:52,910
Here you go.

732
00:23:53,650 --> 00:23:54,850
He can't share it.

733
00:23:54,850 --> 00:23:59,150
(Hades isn't a radio DJ. Suk Jin is excluded.)

734
00:23:59,950 --> 00:24:02,620
(Candidates for Hades)

735
00:24:03,220 --> 00:24:06,430
(Suk Jin is excluded?)

736
00:24:07,460 --> 00:24:08,530
What is it?

737
00:24:08,760 --> 00:24:09,960
It's a married man, right?

738
00:24:09,960 --> 00:24:11,000
- Right? - Is it too broad?

739
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:12,270
- Is it too broad? - It's not like the hints...

740
00:24:12,270 --> 00:24:13,500
we've always received.

741
00:24:13,500 --> 00:24:14,600
Then?

742
00:24:14,600 --> 00:24:16,070
- It's not broad? - No.

743
00:24:16,070 --> 00:24:17,240
Seriously?

744
00:24:17,240 --> 00:24:18,970
- I should've gotten this. - Oh, no.

745
00:24:19,570 --> 00:24:20,570
I'm disappointed.

746
00:24:20,570 --> 00:24:22,640
I'm glad Se Chan knows though.

747
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:24,710
(This time, he opens the brother deities hint.)

748
00:24:24,980 --> 00:24:29,120
(The brother deities are brother and sister.)

749
00:24:29,120 --> 00:24:30,220
Read it out loud.

750
00:24:30,550 --> 00:24:32,150
- What? - Read it out loud.

751
00:24:32,150 --> 00:24:34,090
Who are you to order me around?

752
00:24:34,090 --> 00:24:35,360
I can share this one.

753
00:24:35,720 --> 00:24:36,760
- What is it? - What is it?

754
00:24:36,760 --> 00:24:39,360
"The brother deities are brother and sister."

755
00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:42,000
(Resolutely)

756
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:43,330
(They're brother and sister?)

757
00:24:43,330 --> 00:24:44,400
They're brother and sister.

758
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:46,030
- They're a female and a male. - Exactly.

759
00:24:46,030 --> 00:24:48,770
- There's one each. - They're brother and sister?

760
00:24:48,770 --> 00:24:49,770
Are you sure you were safe to say that?

761
00:24:49,770 --> 00:24:50,940
Hades shouldn't know.

762
00:24:50,940 --> 00:24:53,240
(Was that okay to say? Hades shouldn't know that.)

763
00:24:53,240 --> 00:24:55,510
Hades shouldn't know.

764
00:24:56,480 --> 00:24:59,780
I told you he'd help Hades out.

765
00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:02,350
- Hey. - Should you have told us that?

766
00:25:02,350 --> 00:25:03,680
(Will the brother deities be able to catch Hades?)

767
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:06,720
(They arrive at their third destination.)

768
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:09,290
- Did you enjoy your meal? - Yes.

769
00:25:09,290 --> 00:25:10,520
This is an individual battle.

770
00:25:10,520 --> 00:25:11,560
Okay.

771
00:25:11,560 --> 00:25:12,730
(This mission will be done individually.)

772
00:25:12,730 --> 00:25:15,460
Suk Jin, your eyes are quite swollen.

773
00:25:15,460 --> 00:25:16,630
Why are they swollen?

774
00:25:16,630 --> 00:25:18,670
They swelled up in such a short time.

775
00:25:18,670 --> 00:25:22,170
After we finished eating, we had a break.

776
00:25:22,170 --> 00:25:25,810
I saw Suk Jin sleeping on a chair.

777
00:25:26,270 --> 00:25:28,040
It made me teary-eyed.

778
00:25:28,040 --> 00:25:31,140
(It made me teary-eyed.)

779
00:25:31,950 --> 00:25:34,250
- It did? - That was what I saw of him...

780
00:25:34,250 --> 00:25:36,220
after not seeing him for a while.

781
00:25:36,220 --> 00:25:39,290
Dong Il is concerned about you a lot.

782
00:25:39,290 --> 00:25:40,890
By the way, I was lying down.

783
00:25:40,950 --> 00:25:42,890
You know those lids they put over dishes?

784
00:25:42,890 --> 00:25:44,420
Who put that over my face?

785
00:25:45,690 --> 00:25:48,330
That's better than a white cloth.

786
00:25:49,930 --> 00:25:52,700
(That's better than a white cloth.)

787
00:25:52,700 --> 00:25:57,140
(Only those over 50 can make such jokes.)

788
00:25:57,140 --> 00:26:01,010
This will be an individual battle regarding movies.

789
00:26:01,010 --> 00:26:03,410
It's called Do You Remember That Scene?

790
00:26:03,410 --> 00:26:04,680
(Do You Remember That Scene?)

791
00:26:04,680 --> 00:26:06,150
After listening to the question,

792
00:26:06,150 --> 00:26:09,780
stand in front of 1 of the 3 choices that are given to you.

793
00:26:09,780 --> 00:26:12,990
The last two surviving members will be rewarded.

794
00:26:12,990 --> 00:26:15,260
The first-place winner will be given...

795
00:26:15,260 --> 00:26:16,720
- both hints. - Okay.

796
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:19,760
The 2nd place winner will be given only 1.

797
00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:21,330
- Here's the first question. - Let's hear it.

798
00:26:21,430 --> 00:26:22,600
Here it is.

799
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:24,260
(Which running scene lasts the longest?)

800
00:26:24,260 --> 00:26:26,930
"Which running scene lasts the longest?"

801
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:31,500
("Marathon")

802
00:26:31,500 --> 00:26:32,710
Oh, that one.

803
00:26:32,710 --> 00:26:35,110
(They need to find out which following scene is the longest.)

804
00:26:35,110 --> 00:26:36,840
- Just this scene? - I think so.

805
00:26:36,840 --> 00:26:38,950
You'll be shown a still.

806
00:26:38,950 --> 00:26:40,250
You can figure it out then.

807
00:26:40,250 --> 00:26:42,080
This is easier for actors.

808
00:26:42,080 --> 00:26:43,250
Not at all.

809
00:26:45,490 --> 00:26:46,850
(The scene stops.)

810
00:26:46,850 --> 00:26:47,890
So it's the scene after this one.

811
00:26:47,890 --> 00:26:48,960
(How long does the character run for?)

812
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:51,460
Which one of them runs the longest?

813
00:26:51,460 --> 00:26:52,530
Time-wise?

814
00:26:52,530 --> 00:26:53,630
"The Chaser".

815
00:26:53,930 --> 00:26:55,090
Hey, 4885.

816
00:26:56,060 --> 00:26:58,130
- I saw this four times. - It's you, right?

817
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:02,640
- He was so skinny. - He looked so young.

818
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:04,040
- Get out. - He was so skinny.

819
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:06,270
- This one's long. - He runs for a long time.

820
00:27:06,270 --> 00:27:08,170
- I'm pretty sure. - He runs for a long time.

821
00:27:08,170 --> 00:27:10,280
(How long does this character run for?)

822
00:27:10,710 --> 00:27:11,740
(This is the third movie.)

823
00:27:11,740 --> 00:27:13,110
It's "Forrest Gump".

824
00:27:14,350 --> 00:27:15,420
(Is this one the answer?)

825
00:27:15,420 --> 00:27:16,850
He runs for a very long time.

826
00:27:16,850 --> 00:27:19,550
- Doesn't he run for three minutes? - Doesn't he run forever?

827
00:27:19,550 --> 00:27:21,290
- Tom Hanks is in it. - It's him, right?

828
00:27:22,660 --> 00:27:25,190
He wears that hat until he grows a mustache.

829
00:27:25,190 --> 00:27:26,760
He runs until he grows a mustache.

830
00:27:28,730 --> 00:27:31,900
(This is a famous scene. How long does he run for?)

831
00:27:31,900 --> 00:27:33,030
Goodness.

832
00:27:34,700 --> 00:27:37,570
Which one among these...

833
00:27:37,640 --> 00:27:41,010
do the characters run the longest?

834
00:27:41,970 --> 00:27:43,640
- It must be "Forrest Gump". - Let me answer.

835
00:27:43,640 --> 00:27:45,210
- No, you need to stand up. - You need to stand up.

836
00:27:45,710 --> 00:27:47,380
Suk Jin, please wake up.

837
00:27:47,450 --> 00:27:50,680
Doesn't it feel like the most unlikely one is the answer?

838
00:27:50,680 --> 00:27:52,020
Don't you think it's "Forrest Gump"?

839
00:27:52,020 --> 00:27:54,120
I think it's the most unlikely one.

840
00:27:54,120 --> 00:27:55,320
This will be amazing.

841
00:27:55,320 --> 00:27:56,560
Everyone's standing in front of this one.

842
00:27:56,560 --> 00:27:58,420
- You chose "Marathon"? - No one else is coming here?

843
00:27:58,890 --> 00:28:00,960
In "The Chaser", he trips and then runs again.

844
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:02,160
- Exactly! - That's right.

845
00:28:02,160 --> 00:28:04,260
The protagonist runs longer in "The Chaser" than in "Marathon".

846
00:28:04,260 --> 00:28:06,770
I paused the movie because I was out of breath.

847
00:28:07,100 --> 00:28:09,800
If it's a chase of high-tension,

848
00:28:09,800 --> 00:28:11,800
it doesn't feel as boring.

849
00:28:11,800 --> 00:28:14,410
However, it feels boring if the scene is a touching one.

850
00:28:14,410 --> 00:28:17,010
The protagonist in "Marathon" runs really long.

851
00:28:17,010 --> 00:28:19,580
All right. I'll reveal the answer then.

852
00:28:19,580 --> 00:28:21,410
- Sure. - We'll start with...

853
00:28:21,410 --> 00:28:22,780
"Forrest Gump".

854
00:28:22,780 --> 00:28:24,880
That must be the shortest!

855
00:28:24,980 --> 00:28:27,350
- It must be short. - It must be.

856
00:28:27,350 --> 00:28:29,090
- Okay. - It must be the shortest.

857
00:28:30,620 --> 00:28:31,690
Here he goes.

858
00:28:31,990 --> 00:28:33,330
Is he running now?

859
00:28:33,660 --> 00:28:35,230
This is where he begins to run.

860
00:28:35,430 --> 00:28:37,260
He runs until you can't see him.

861
00:28:38,060 --> 00:28:40,130
The same amount of time...

862
00:28:40,900 --> 00:28:43,700
(Off he goes!)

863
00:28:43,700 --> 00:28:45,410
- He's running. - Gosh.

864
00:28:46,540 --> 00:28:48,240
It's longer than I expected.

865
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:50,010
- It's going on for a while. - He's featured on the news.

866
00:28:50,010 --> 00:28:51,810
- Yes, the news. - That's right.

867
00:28:51,810 --> 00:28:53,480
- He gets a beard. - People start to follow him.

868
00:28:53,480 --> 00:28:54,750
Yes, they do.

869
00:28:54,780 --> 00:28:56,350
This is already quite long.

870
00:28:56,350 --> 00:28:58,480
- This'll surpass a minute. - For sure.

871
00:28:58,480 --> 00:29:00,350
He's hasn't even changed clothes yet.

872
00:29:00,350 --> 00:29:01,690
You're right.

873
00:29:01,690 --> 00:29:03,760
- There's not a hint of a beard. - Not yet.

874
00:29:03,760 --> 00:29:04,960
He then sports a beard.

875
00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:05,990
We should be on the next scene by now.

876
00:29:05,990 --> 00:29:07,090
Please move on.

877
00:29:07,090 --> 00:29:08,460
Is this for real?

878
00:29:08,690 --> 00:29:10,330
Maybe this is the longest running scene.

879
00:29:10,330 --> 00:29:11,530
(He's worried.)

880
00:29:11,530 --> 00:29:13,730
- It's long. - Was it this long?

881
00:29:14,030 --> 00:29:17,370
(The scene suddenly changes though.)

882
00:29:17,700 --> 00:29:19,870
- Nice! - All right.

883
00:29:19,870 --> 00:29:20,870
This is really short.

884
00:29:20,870 --> 00:29:22,540
- Is this for real? - So "Forrest Gump"...

885
00:29:22,540 --> 00:29:23,710
Is this how the movie goes?

886
00:29:23,710 --> 00:29:25,310
It's 45 seconds.

887
00:29:25,310 --> 00:29:26,610
Yes, this is how the movie goes.

888
00:29:26,610 --> 00:29:28,350
Why are you suddenly frowning?

889
00:29:28,350 --> 00:29:29,520
The scene changed.

890
00:29:29,580 --> 00:29:31,320
"Forrest Gump", 45 seconds.

891
00:29:31,320 --> 00:29:32,790
It has to be the same scene.

892
00:29:32,790 --> 00:29:34,850
The scene in "The Chaser" will be over a minute.

893
00:29:36,220 --> 00:29:38,290
4885. Okay, he's running.

894
00:29:39,260 --> 00:29:40,960
Could it be two minutes?

895
00:29:41,360 --> 00:29:45,230
It's the most important scene in the movie.

896
00:29:45,900 --> 00:29:47,630
No, not yet!

897
00:29:47,630 --> 00:29:48,770
It's only been eight seconds.

898
00:29:48,770 --> 00:29:51,100
- No, not yet! - Wait, it's over!

899
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:53,970
He only tripped and he's still running.

900
00:29:53,970 --> 00:29:55,210
But...

901
00:29:55,840 --> 00:29:57,640
- Up he goes the stairs. - The stairs.

902
00:29:57,640 --> 00:29:59,510
- Run! - Run harder.

903
00:29:59,510 --> 00:30:00,980
- Run! - Keep running!

904
00:30:00,980 --> 00:30:02,250
Trip!

905
00:30:02,250 --> 00:30:03,880
- No, not yet. - Keep running.

906
00:30:03,880 --> 00:30:05,250
- Keep going. - He needs to run some more.

907
00:30:05,250 --> 00:30:06,950
- That's right. - Run some more!

908
00:30:06,950 --> 00:30:08,050
Yes!

909
00:30:08,520 --> 00:30:10,160
- 47 seconds. - Keep running!

910
00:30:10,160 --> 00:30:11,260
- Keep going. - He stopped running.

911
00:30:11,390 --> 00:30:12,990
No, not yet. He'll run again.

912
00:30:12,990 --> 00:30:15,330
That's it!

913
00:30:15,330 --> 00:30:16,860
Is he running some more?

914
00:30:17,500 --> 00:30:18,600
No way.

915
00:30:18,600 --> 00:30:20,000
- Go, go! - No, stop.

916
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:21,300
- Go! - He's a running man.

917
00:30:21,300 --> 00:30:22,500
Look at him run.

918
00:30:22,500 --> 00:30:23,700
No, please stop.

919
00:30:23,700 --> 00:30:25,200
I think it's a perfect win.

920
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:26,970
Please run some more.

921
00:30:27,010 --> 00:30:28,610
This is unfair.

922
00:30:28,770 --> 00:30:29,940
He finally stopped.

923
00:30:30,110 --> 00:30:31,140
- It's over. - All right.

924
00:30:31,140 --> 00:30:32,780
- A minute and... - A minute and 33 seconds.

925
00:30:32,780 --> 00:30:34,680
- Yes! - Nice!

926
00:30:34,680 --> 00:30:37,850
It's not bad. It's actually quite good.

927
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:39,990
Last but not least, let's check "Marathon".

928
00:30:39,990 --> 00:30:42,090
The song is quite long in this movie.

929
00:30:42,090 --> 00:30:45,160
The scene could change after six seconds.

930
00:30:45,190 --> 00:30:46,490
- Here he goes. - He's running.

931
00:30:48,130 --> 00:30:50,000
(To the sentimental music,)

932
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:53,370
(the protagonist starts to run.)

933
00:30:53,370 --> 00:30:56,300
He's in the finals, so the run is very long.

934
00:30:56,500 --> 00:30:57,870
No, you never know.

935
00:30:57,870 --> 00:31:00,140
He might not actually run the whole marathon.

936
00:31:00,140 --> 00:31:02,070
- That's right. - This is a variety show, isn't it?

937
00:31:02,610 --> 00:31:05,880
- Look. - He's holding a chocolate pie.

938
00:31:05,880 --> 00:31:07,250
Drop it.

939
00:31:08,350 --> 00:31:10,880
- There. - Goodness. Pick it up!

940
00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:12,450
It's over. He's not running.

941
00:31:12,590 --> 00:31:14,350
The scene hasn't exactly changed.

942
00:31:14,350 --> 00:31:17,290
- Seriously? - This shouldn't count.

943
00:31:17,290 --> 00:31:18,860
But that was the case for us.

944
00:31:18,860 --> 00:31:20,630
He'll now run while enjoying the scenery.

945
00:31:20,630 --> 00:31:22,400
- That's right. - He'll enjoy the wind.

946
00:31:22,400 --> 00:31:24,800
He greets the people in the neighborhood.

947
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:26,430
How long was "The Chaser" again?

948
00:31:26,430 --> 00:31:27,500
A minute and 33 seconds.

949
00:31:27,500 --> 00:31:29,340
It's almost over. He's at the finish line!

950
00:31:29,340 --> 00:31:31,900
- He's almost there. - Run past the finish line!

951
00:31:31,900 --> 00:31:33,270
I see the finish line.

952
00:31:33,270 --> 00:31:35,410
Run a little more!

953
00:31:35,710 --> 00:31:37,080
- Please cut it short. - Please.

954
00:31:37,410 --> 00:31:39,410
Even I'm rooting for Cho Seung Woo now.

955
00:31:40,550 --> 00:31:42,980
(It's almost at a minute and 30 seconds.)

956
00:31:42,980 --> 00:31:45,380
It's easier to run in the rain.

957
00:31:45,480 --> 00:31:47,390
(A minute and 30 seconds passed on "Marathon".)

958
00:31:47,890 --> 00:31:50,120
He runs until he reaches the finish line.

959
00:31:51,560 --> 00:31:54,130
How is this any fun if "Marathon" has the longest scene?

960
00:31:54,630 --> 00:31:57,760
(Which team won?)

961
00:32:00,900 --> 00:32:04,200
(He ran longer than the protagonist in "The Chaser".)

962
00:32:05,140 --> 00:32:07,810
("Marathon" has the longest running scene.)

963
00:32:07,810 --> 00:32:09,340
- No way. - This movie...

964
00:32:09,340 --> 00:32:12,550
has the longest running scene at 4 minutes and 33 seconds.

965
00:32:12,980 --> 00:32:14,250
But...

966
00:32:14,680 --> 00:32:16,950
(The protagonist went on...)

967
00:32:16,950 --> 00:32:17,950
(to run through...)

968
00:32:17,950 --> 00:32:20,150
(a supermarket, a swimming pool, and a subway station.)

969
00:32:20,150 --> 00:32:23,360
(Even a zebra joined him.)

970
00:32:23,360 --> 00:32:26,430
(He crosses the finish line after 4 minutes and 33 seconds.)

971
00:32:26,890 --> 00:32:28,690
I didn't choose it because I thought it was obvious.

972
00:32:28,690 --> 00:32:31,830
So Min, Dong Il, and Jae Suk win a point each.

973
00:32:32,500 --> 00:32:35,170
So here's the next question.

974
00:32:35,170 --> 00:32:38,900
(Which line from the movie lasts the longest?)

975
00:32:39,070 --> 00:32:42,170
("A Promise")

976
00:32:42,170 --> 00:32:43,710
- This scene. - It's a long one.

977
00:32:43,710 --> 00:32:46,080
- I cried during this scene. - Me too.

978
00:32:47,310 --> 00:32:48,580
("Assassination")

979
00:32:48,580 --> 00:32:49,980
Gosh, this one.

980
00:32:49,980 --> 00:32:52,120
Go on and take a look.

981
00:32:52,280 --> 00:32:53,350
Good one.

982
00:32:55,220 --> 00:32:56,490
The line that follows?

983
00:32:56,490 --> 00:32:57,490
(How long does his testimony go on for?)

984
00:32:57,820 --> 00:33:01,890
("The Attorney")

985
00:33:02,600 --> 00:33:04,200
(How long did the protagonist's line last?)

986
00:33:04,200 --> 00:33:05,600
This is a hard choice.

987
00:33:05,600 --> 00:33:06,600
(How long did the protagonist's line last?)

988
00:33:06,770 --> 00:33:09,540
Which of the following scenes...

989
00:33:09,540 --> 00:33:12,300
takes the longest to wrap up?

990
00:33:12,410 --> 00:33:13,970
(This is a tough one.)

991
00:33:14,740 --> 00:33:15,740
Me too.

992
00:33:16,410 --> 00:33:17,580
I think it's "The Attorney".

993
00:33:18,210 --> 00:33:19,350
I think it's "Assassination".

994
00:33:19,350 --> 00:33:20,450
"Assassination"?

995
00:33:21,110 --> 00:33:24,320
Every actor has a different speed...

996
00:33:24,320 --> 00:33:26,520
of which they speak in when delivering lines.

997
00:33:26,520 --> 00:33:29,290
Song Kang Ho delivers his line quite fast...

998
00:33:29,290 --> 00:33:31,220
and so does Park Shin Yang.

999
00:33:31,220 --> 00:33:32,860
They spit out their lines.

1000
00:33:32,860 --> 00:33:34,590
- But it'll be only one page... - Right.

1001
00:33:34,590 --> 00:33:36,500
- Three... - It could be short.

1002
00:33:36,500 --> 00:33:38,060
- Two. - Hold on.

1003
00:33:38,060 --> 00:33:39,900
- What's up with you all? - What Dong Il said...

1004
00:33:39,900 --> 00:33:40,970
Hold on a second.

1005
00:33:40,970 --> 00:33:42,900
- I could be wrong, you know. - One.

1006
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:45,810
Time's up. Your decision is final.

1007
00:33:45,810 --> 00:33:47,810
Just like last time, we'll start with the third movie.

1008
00:33:47,810 --> 00:33:49,340
Then it must not be the longest.

1009
00:33:49,340 --> 00:33:50,510
Are we starting with "The Attorney"?

1010
00:33:50,510 --> 00:33:51,640
- Yes. - Then it's not the longest.

1011
00:33:52,040 --> 00:33:53,610
- This is where it starts. - Right.

1012
00:33:53,610 --> 00:33:56,050
(He begins his dialogue.)

1013
00:33:56,880 --> 00:33:59,320
According to Article 1, Section 2 of the Constitution...

1014
00:33:59,320 --> 00:34:00,990
Kang Ho...

1015
00:34:00,990 --> 00:34:03,160
- His speech is fast. - Sovereignty resides in the people,

1016
00:34:04,390 --> 00:34:07,160
and all state authority shall emanate from the people.

1017
00:34:07,160 --> 00:34:08,990
The nation is its people!

1018
00:34:09,300 --> 00:34:10,300
(Just like Dong Il said...)

1019
00:34:10,300 --> 00:34:12,160
- He talks fast. - You're right.

1020
00:34:12,160 --> 00:34:13,670
- Right? - He talks fast.

1021
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:16,000
It's what I noticed over the years.

1022
00:34:16,600 --> 00:34:18,900
Counsel is badgering the witness!

1023
00:34:19,070 --> 00:34:20,410
- Have you... - Counsel!

1024
00:34:20,410 --> 00:34:21,410
Is there more?

1025
00:34:21,440 --> 00:34:23,410
- Do you admit to torture? - No.

1026
00:34:23,910 --> 00:34:24,910
(His dialogue is over.)

1027
00:34:24,910 --> 00:34:26,980
- It ended. - That was 40 seconds.

1028
00:34:27,510 --> 00:34:28,510
It's short.

1029
00:34:28,510 --> 00:34:30,980
That can't be the longest dialogue.

1030
00:34:31,280 --> 00:34:33,320
- Please let it be "A Promise" next. - It has to be over a minute.

1031
00:34:33,320 --> 00:34:34,390
Here we go.

1032
00:34:34,990 --> 00:34:38,390
(The accused begins his dialogue.)

1033
00:34:38,390 --> 00:34:39,990
Six of them!

1034
00:34:39,990 --> 00:34:42,090
- There are six. - In 1912,

1035
00:34:42,230 --> 00:34:45,360
I was hit during the assassination of the governor.

1036
00:34:45,360 --> 00:34:46,430
See the two holes?

1037
00:34:46,430 --> 00:34:47,900
- Here we go. - I got this one in 1922...

1038
00:34:48,070 --> 00:34:50,000
and this one in 1927 in Khabarovsk.

1039
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:52,470
He's talking quite fast. What's going on?

1040
00:34:52,710 --> 00:34:54,510
- It's fast. - You said he talks slowly.

1041
00:34:54,510 --> 00:34:56,180
- He does. - Let's keep watching.

1042
00:34:56,180 --> 00:34:57,910
We might have a chance.

1043
00:34:57,910 --> 00:34:58,940
(This speed might give us a chance.)

1044
00:34:58,940 --> 00:35:00,080
(The dialogue lasted 40 seconds in "The Attorney".)

1045
00:35:00,080 --> 00:35:01,110
Please.

1046
00:35:01,110 --> 00:35:02,680
(The dialogue lasted 40 seconds in "The Attorney".)

1047
00:35:03,250 --> 00:35:04,480
- Okay! - There's more.

1048
00:35:04,480 --> 00:35:05,520
It's over.

1049
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:06,650
You don't know...

1050
00:35:07,390 --> 00:35:08,620
what I felt when I lost all of them!

1051
00:35:08,620 --> 00:35:10,690
(His dialogue is longer than that from "The Attorney".)

1052
00:35:10,690 --> 00:35:13,460
You never know. He should talk some more.

1053
00:35:13,760 --> 00:35:14,790
Please keep going.

1054
00:35:14,790 --> 00:35:15,800
They'd fight to their deaths!

1055
00:35:15,800 --> 00:35:17,630
- Here it goes. - He slowed down.

1056
00:35:17,630 --> 00:35:20,270
(His speech finally slows down.)

1057
00:35:20,630 --> 00:35:22,400
- No, gosh, no. - Please, no.

1058
00:35:22,400 --> 00:35:24,070
- Say some more. - Come on!

1059
00:35:24,070 --> 00:35:26,070
- He'll turn around and keep going. - Go on!

1060
00:35:26,070 --> 00:35:27,170
Say your lines!

1061
00:35:27,170 --> 00:35:28,910
(If it ends here, it'll only be 58 seconds.)

1062
00:35:28,910 --> 00:35:31,210
Your Honor, please interrupt him.

1063
00:35:31,210 --> 00:35:32,280
(A minute isn't enough to guarantee their win.)

1064
00:35:32,280 --> 00:35:34,510
(Will the protagonist say more?)

1065
00:35:34,510 --> 00:35:35,680
(That's all.)

1066
00:35:35,680 --> 00:35:37,850
- He ended it. - 59 seconds.

1067
00:35:37,850 --> 00:35:39,690
(The dialogue ends at 59 seconds.)

1068
00:35:39,690 --> 00:35:41,320
("Assassination" is currently in 1st place.)

1069
00:35:41,320 --> 00:35:43,160
- It's shorter than I expected. - Exactly.

1070
00:35:43,160 --> 00:35:45,690
The speech in "A Promise" is very long.

1071
00:35:45,690 --> 00:35:47,230
(All that's left is "A Promise".)

1072
00:35:47,230 --> 00:35:48,390
Is it "A Promise" then?

1073
00:35:50,030 --> 00:35:51,530
(Park Shin Yang begins his lines.)

1074
00:35:51,530 --> 00:35:52,530
Here we go.

1075
00:35:52,530 --> 00:35:53,530
(Park Shin Yang begins his lines.)

1076
00:35:53,970 --> 00:35:56,170
(She's already on the verge of tears.)

1077
00:35:56,170 --> 00:35:57,470
The background music isn't a good sign.

1078
00:35:57,470 --> 00:35:59,710
This will at least be a minute.

1079
00:35:59,710 --> 00:36:01,310
Only long lines get background music.

1080
00:36:01,310 --> 00:36:02,810
(The same happened in "Marathon".)

1081
00:36:02,810 --> 00:36:04,710
She's a fine doctor too.

1082
00:36:04,710 --> 00:36:06,480
- I think we've lost. - Already?

1083
00:36:06,480 --> 00:36:09,250
- He has a lot of lines left. - It's already been...

1084
00:36:09,250 --> 00:36:11,150
- Already... - I feel like we've already lost.

1085
00:36:11,150 --> 00:36:13,190
He didn't say much but 20 seconds passed.

1086
00:36:18,490 --> 00:36:19,690
How long of a break is he taking?

1087
00:36:19,690 --> 00:36:20,690
Gosh.

1088
00:36:22,230 --> 00:36:24,160
He stopped for five seconds after "I."

1089
00:36:25,160 --> 00:36:26,500
Go on with your line!

1090
00:36:26,500 --> 00:36:27,570
He's right.

1091
00:36:28,600 --> 00:36:30,440
- Oh, dear. - Oh, no.

1092
00:36:30,440 --> 00:36:32,070
He's not even at the climax.

1093
00:36:32,070 --> 00:36:33,310
No way.

1094
00:36:33,510 --> 00:36:34,940
He's still at this line.

1095
00:36:35,110 --> 00:36:36,710
Game over.

1096
00:36:36,710 --> 00:36:38,340
He's not even at his main line.

1097
00:36:38,340 --> 00:36:39,380
- If you... - If you...

1098
00:36:39,380 --> 00:36:41,480
(He begins the climax after 50 seconds.)

1099
00:36:41,480 --> 00:36:43,480
"If you ask what I did wrong..."

1100
00:36:44,120 --> 00:36:45,380
"If you ask me my sin..."

1101
00:36:45,380 --> 00:36:46,420
("Assassination" was 59 seconds.)

1102
00:36:46,490 --> 00:36:48,190
"If you ask me why..."

1103
00:36:48,550 --> 00:36:49,790
"All I did was love her."

1104
00:36:49,790 --> 00:36:51,460
- "All I did was love her." - "I loved her."

1105
00:36:51,520 --> 00:36:52,520
All I did was love her.

1106
00:36:52,520 --> 00:36:53,860
"I loved her."

1107
00:36:53,860 --> 00:36:56,330
(What's he doing?)

1108
00:36:56,330 --> 00:36:59,700
(It doesn't take much to go from a great actor to a fool.)

1109
00:37:00,330 --> 00:37:03,940
"My biggest sin is that I'm leaving her behind."

1110
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:06,070
I'm getting sad all over again.

1111
00:37:06,540 --> 00:37:08,440
(Almost in tears)

1112
00:37:08,510 --> 00:37:10,280
- Game over. - Just so you know,

1113
00:37:10,280 --> 00:37:14,250
his lines continue until a minute and 52 seconds.

1114
00:37:14,250 --> 00:37:15,680
(So Min and Ji Hyo win a point each.)

1115
00:37:15,980 --> 00:37:17,320
Hit someone from the second team.

1116
00:37:17,320 --> 00:37:18,620
Did only you two win points?

1117
00:37:18,850 --> 00:37:20,150
- Ji Hyo? - I'll...

1118
00:37:20,150 --> 00:37:22,860
- Bae Seong Woo? - I'll hit his behind.

1119
00:37:23,360 --> 00:37:25,690
(She choose to hit Bae Seong Woo's behind.)

1120
00:37:25,690 --> 00:37:27,430
Seong Woo's bottom naturally sticks out,

1121
00:37:27,430 --> 00:37:29,330
so it already provides a lot of cushion.

1122
00:37:29,600 --> 00:37:31,930
See? Look at that.

1123
00:37:32,700 --> 00:37:34,700
He has great posture.

1124
00:37:34,700 --> 00:37:36,370
Swing up from the bottom.

1125
00:37:36,370 --> 00:37:38,600
- Like this? - Don't aim too low though.

1126
00:37:38,600 --> 00:37:40,710
- What? - Hold on.

1127
00:37:40,710 --> 00:37:41,740
Too low?

1128
00:37:42,170 --> 00:37:44,510
(Don't aim too low though.)

1129
00:37:44,510 --> 00:37:45,840
- Too low? - It'll be a disaster.

1130
00:37:45,840 --> 00:37:47,880
- Well... - If you do...

1131
00:37:47,880 --> 00:37:50,180
He'll have to sing the national anthem.

1132
00:37:50,180 --> 00:37:51,580
(The national anthem...)

1133
00:37:51,920 --> 00:37:53,390
- One... - Look at him.

1134
00:37:53,390 --> 00:37:55,490
Why did you suddenly tuck in your tailbone?

1135
00:37:55,490 --> 00:37:58,360
- Stick it out like before. - But that's not my bottom.

1136
00:37:58,360 --> 00:37:59,590
Is that why?

1137
00:37:59,630 --> 00:38:01,390
She'll hit your bottom anyway.

1138
00:38:01,390 --> 00:38:03,530
There you go. Be a man.

1139
00:38:03,860 --> 00:38:05,230
Let's do this.

1140
00:38:05,230 --> 00:38:06,800
(He tries to focus but fails.)

1141
00:38:08,170 --> 00:38:09,700
(Smack)

1142
00:38:10,240 --> 00:38:12,300
(The sound was quite loud.)

1143
00:38:12,540 --> 00:38:14,570
His bottom beat the squeaky hammer.

1144
00:38:14,870 --> 00:38:16,810
- The hammer bounced off his bottom. - His bottom...

1145
00:38:16,880 --> 00:38:18,280
Why didn't it squeak?

1146
00:38:18,580 --> 00:38:20,150
- It just bounced off his bottom. - That's incredible.

1147
00:38:20,480 --> 00:38:22,010
You guys do it. I already hit Kwang Soo.

1148
00:38:22,010 --> 00:38:23,150
- I'm done. - Suk Jin, you can do it.

1149
00:38:23,150 --> 00:38:24,280
Jae Suk, come here.

1150
00:38:24,850 --> 00:38:27,350
- Jae Suk. Good. - I'll flick his forehead.

1151
00:38:27,490 --> 00:38:28,850
Suk Jin's flick is really strong.

1152
00:38:29,660 --> 00:38:32,060
- You can't hold my head. - I won't.

1153
00:38:32,490 --> 00:38:34,690
(Suk Jin gets ready to flick, frowning.)

1154
00:38:34,690 --> 00:38:36,060
(With this flick,)

1155
00:38:36,060 --> 00:38:38,160
(I'll teach you a lesson.)

1156
00:38:38,160 --> 00:38:39,570
(It's too weak.)

1157
00:38:41,170 --> 00:38:42,940
- Gosh. - He missed it.

1158
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:44,400
- Oh, my. - You're too weak.

1159
00:38:44,470 --> 00:38:45,840
Suk Jin.

1160
00:38:46,170 --> 00:38:48,870
- He missed it. - But...

1161
00:38:48,870 --> 00:38:50,080
you have to do it again.

1162
00:38:50,140 --> 00:38:51,410
I saw it.

1163
00:38:51,410 --> 00:38:53,380
But you have to do it again.

1164
00:38:53,380 --> 00:38:54,650
I saw it.

1165
00:38:54,710 --> 00:38:56,220
When Suk Jin was flicking his forehead,

1166
00:38:56,520 --> 00:38:58,250
- Jae Suk moved forward. - No.

1167
00:38:58,250 --> 00:38:59,950
- You can't do that. - I didn't.

1168
00:38:59,950 --> 00:39:01,650
If you let me flick you, I'll let you flick me again.

1169
00:39:01,650 --> 00:39:03,260
What are you talking about?

1170
00:39:03,260 --> 00:39:04,720
You're being ridiculous.

1171
00:39:05,090 --> 00:39:07,890
- Suk Jin, let me flick you. - That doesn't make sense.

1172
00:39:07,890 --> 00:39:09,030
Okay, try it.

1173
00:39:09,030 --> 00:39:10,160
Are you letting him flick you?

1174
00:39:10,160 --> 00:39:12,600
For him to flick me, I should flick him too.

1175
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:14,500
That sounds surprisingly convincing.

1176
00:39:14,500 --> 00:39:15,970
(It's surprisingly convincing.)

1177
00:39:15,970 --> 00:39:17,670
Your nose or forehead?

1178
00:39:17,670 --> 00:39:19,070
- Eyes... - Nose is better.

1179
00:39:19,140 --> 00:39:20,170
Nose is better.

1180
00:39:20,170 --> 00:39:21,540
Nose is better, definitely.

1181
00:39:21,640 --> 00:39:23,840
- I'll flick your nose too. - Okay.

1182
00:39:23,840 --> 00:39:25,140
- Take off your glasses. - It's better on the nose?

1183
00:39:25,510 --> 00:39:26,550
His nose must be heavy.

1184
00:39:26,550 --> 00:39:28,080
- I'll catch it over here. - Okay.

1185
00:39:28,810 --> 00:39:30,250
Just in case.

1186
00:39:31,150 --> 00:39:32,420
- I can't wait. - But...

1187
00:39:32,480 --> 00:39:33,620
This is fair, right?

1188
00:39:34,450 --> 00:39:36,460
(Flicked)

1189
00:39:37,020 --> 00:39:38,890
(His nose swings.)

1190
00:39:41,660 --> 00:39:43,600
(Shocked)

1191
00:39:43,600 --> 00:39:45,060
(Angry)

1192
00:39:45,130 --> 00:39:46,370
That really hurts.

1193
00:39:46,370 --> 00:39:47,470
Like when you ate horseradish.

1194
00:39:47,470 --> 00:39:49,870
(Is he okay?)

1195
00:39:50,540 --> 00:39:51,800
Let me take your glasses.

1196
00:39:51,800 --> 00:39:53,240
- Come here. - Aim well.

1197
00:39:54,010 --> 00:39:55,270
Take off your glasses.

1198
00:39:55,640 --> 00:39:56,940
I want to flick your mouth.

1199
00:39:57,010 --> 00:39:58,180
All right.

1200
00:39:58,180 --> 00:39:59,210
(It's too weak again.)

1201
00:40:01,550 --> 00:40:03,180
(Suk Jin missed it.)

1202
00:40:03,180 --> 00:40:04,420
He missed it.

1203
00:40:04,520 --> 00:40:05,720
What's wrong?

1204
00:40:05,720 --> 00:40:06,790
(In addition to his punch, his flick is weak too.)

1205
00:40:06,790 --> 00:40:08,750
- Did he miss it? - Suk Jin.

1206
00:40:09,250 --> 00:40:10,520
Let Jae Suk flick you again.

1207
00:40:10,520 --> 00:40:11,720
- What's with you? - That was so close.

1208
00:40:11,860 --> 00:40:13,030
Seriously.

1209
00:40:13,830 --> 00:40:15,790
- I'm so angry. - Let's do it again.

1210
00:40:15,790 --> 00:40:17,860
You have to flick him properly once.

1211
00:40:17,960 --> 00:40:19,670
(Is that really necessary?)

1212
00:40:20,730 --> 00:40:21,900
(He's flicked again.)

1213
00:40:22,730 --> 00:40:24,600
(It's strong.)

1214
00:40:24,600 --> 00:40:27,270
(The sound was unbelievably loud.)

1215
00:40:27,270 --> 00:40:31,010
(Is this really necessary on a variety show?)

1216
00:40:31,010 --> 00:40:33,350
(It's time for Suk Jin to take revenge.)

1217
00:40:33,350 --> 00:40:34,910
- It hurts just watching it. - It has to be at least that strong.

1218
00:40:34,980 --> 00:40:36,220
- This is annoying. - It has to be.

1219
00:40:36,350 --> 00:40:37,750
This is your last chance.

1220
00:40:37,750 --> 00:40:38,950
Right.

1221
00:40:38,950 --> 00:40:40,820
(He won't get any more chances.)

1222
00:40:40,820 --> 00:40:43,220
(This is the last chance he has.)

1223
00:40:43,220 --> 00:40:45,160
(Will Suk Jin be able to take revenge?)

1224
00:40:45,160 --> 00:40:46,460
(Flick)

1225
00:40:49,090 --> 00:40:53,600
(It was a proper flick this time.)

1226
00:40:53,600 --> 00:40:57,570
(It sounded like the clang of a bell.)

1227
00:40:57,570 --> 00:40:59,070
(Everyone congratulates Suk Jin.)

1228
00:40:59,070 --> 00:41:00,440
It hurt a lot, right?

1229
00:41:00,740 --> 00:41:02,670
(Unbelievable)

1230
00:41:02,670 --> 00:41:03,940
That was nice.

1231
00:41:03,940 --> 00:41:05,440
- It was proper. - It was.

1232
00:41:05,510 --> 00:41:06,650
It was proper.

1233
00:41:06,650 --> 00:41:08,580
His nose went around and hit his ear.

1234
00:41:09,310 --> 00:41:11,880
All right. Four people survived.

1235
00:41:11,880 --> 00:41:13,690
The four of them will play rock-paper-scissors...

1236
00:41:14,020 --> 00:41:16,260
to decide 1st and 2nd places.

1237
00:41:16,860 --> 00:41:18,590
(They play rock-paper-scissors to decide 1st place.)

1238
00:41:18,590 --> 00:41:20,230
(Ji Hyo wins.)

1239
00:41:20,890 --> 00:41:22,030
Ji Hyo.

1240
00:41:22,090 --> 00:41:24,030
I keep losing at rock-paper-scissors today.

1241
00:41:24,030 --> 00:41:25,060
Rock-paper-scissors.

1242
00:41:25,060 --> 00:41:26,500
(So Min wins.)

1243
00:41:26,500 --> 00:41:27,530
(So Min gets to pick the hint she wants.)

1244
00:41:27,530 --> 00:41:28,730
- Let's sit down. - Okay.

1245
00:41:28,830 --> 00:41:30,470
Let's just sit down.

1246
00:41:30,470 --> 00:41:33,210
(Dong Il wraps up the situation.)

1247
00:41:33,210 --> 00:41:34,510
First place, come here.

1248
00:41:34,510 --> 00:41:35,710
(Ji Hyo receives a hint first.)

1249
00:41:35,710 --> 00:41:38,710
(The hint is about the brother deities.)

1250
00:41:38,710 --> 00:41:41,150
(The brother deities are not in their 20s.)

1251
00:41:41,150 --> 00:41:42,980
(Moments before...)

1252
00:41:42,980 --> 00:41:44,920
(The hint given after the meal mission said...)

1253
00:41:44,920 --> 00:41:47,220
(the deities are brother and sister.)

1254
00:41:47,220 --> 00:41:49,350
(Among the 4 female candidates, those not in their 20s are...)

1255
00:41:49,350 --> 00:41:53,090
(So Min and Ji Hyo.)

1256
00:41:53,090 --> 00:41:56,530
That hint is about the other two deities, right?

1257
00:41:56,630 --> 00:41:57,730
Exactly.

1258
00:41:58,160 --> 00:42:00,100
Poseidon and Zeus.

1259
00:42:00,100 --> 00:42:03,070
(Now, Ji Hyo will receive a hint about Hades.)

1260
00:42:03,070 --> 00:42:07,440
(Hades is not in his or her 20s.)

1261
00:42:07,440 --> 00:42:10,140
(Yi Hyun and Hye Jun are excluded.)

1262
00:42:10,140 --> 00:42:12,240
Do you want a hint about Zeus and Poseidon...

1263
00:42:12,240 --> 00:42:14,180
or about Hades?

1264
00:42:14,180 --> 00:42:15,710
(So Min, in 2nd place, can choose the hint she wants.)

1265
00:42:15,710 --> 00:42:18,220
Hades can actually be one of us.

1266
00:42:18,480 --> 00:42:19,690
What do you mean?

1267
00:42:19,790 --> 00:42:21,990
- Among those who get a hint. - Among us?

1268
00:42:22,750 --> 00:42:26,290
(If So Min is Hades, she'd choose a hint about the brother deities.)

1269
00:42:26,290 --> 00:42:28,790
(But she chose a hint about Hades.)

1270
00:42:28,790 --> 00:42:31,200
Did it give you any ideas? Was it too general?

1271
00:42:31,200 --> 00:42:32,560
No, it wasn't that general.

1272
00:42:32,560 --> 00:42:33,770
It actually gave me an idea.

1273
00:42:33,770 --> 00:42:35,870
- It's not general? - Not much.

1274
00:42:36,030 --> 00:42:38,400
We'll begin the race now,

1275
00:42:38,470 --> 00:42:40,270
during which, you'll have to protect Zeus and Poseidon...

1276
00:42:40,270 --> 00:42:42,810
and eliminate Hades for good.

1277
00:42:42,980 --> 00:42:44,140
It's called The Otherworld.

1278
00:42:44,140 --> 00:42:45,980
(Final Mission: The Otherworld)

1279
00:42:46,410 --> 00:42:48,110
The race will take place...

1280
00:42:49,080 --> 00:42:52,550
at a place filled with spirits Hades brought from the Otherworld.

1281
00:42:52,720 --> 00:42:55,620
(The place is filled with spirits Hades brought from the Otherworld.)

1282
00:42:55,720 --> 00:42:57,360
(Welcome to the Otherworld.)

1283
00:42:57,360 --> 00:42:58,990
What is this?

1284
00:42:59,320 --> 00:43:01,660
Hidden in that building are hints about Hades,

1285
00:43:01,660 --> 00:43:03,360
the brother deities,

1286
00:43:03,360 --> 00:43:05,300
and how to eliminate...

1287
00:43:05,300 --> 00:43:06,930
Hades.

1288
00:43:07,700 --> 00:43:08,870
We have to find them?

1289
00:43:08,870 --> 00:43:12,340
Before Hades eliminate Zeus and Poseidon,

1290
00:43:12,340 --> 00:43:15,040
find and eliminate Hades, and Team Human will win.

1291
00:43:15,040 --> 00:43:17,440
But if Hades eliminate his or her brothers first,

1292
00:43:17,440 --> 00:43:19,180
Hades will win alone.

1293
00:43:19,240 --> 00:43:21,210
- Are we playing individually? - Alone?

1294
00:43:21,480 --> 00:43:25,020
Also, there's a special photo studio in the Otherworld.

1295
00:43:25,020 --> 00:43:26,790
(The Otherworld has a special photo studio.)

1296
00:43:27,520 --> 00:43:30,590
The photo studio opens at certain times.

1297
00:43:30,590 --> 00:43:33,660
The two who find the tickets can choose a person...

1298
00:43:33,660 --> 00:43:35,530
of their choice to enter the studio.

1299
00:43:35,590 --> 00:43:37,330
When the four of them take a photo together,

1300
00:43:37,330 --> 00:43:39,930
depending on whether the photo includes the brothers or Hades,

1301
00:43:39,930 --> 00:43:42,370
- the photo will look different. - That's creepy.

1302
00:43:42,370 --> 00:43:45,170
Photos with the brother deities in them will look bright.

1303
00:43:45,170 --> 00:43:47,970
Photos with Hades in them will look dark.

1304
00:43:48,040 --> 00:43:52,210
If both the brothers and Hades are in the same picture,

1305
00:43:52,210 --> 00:43:54,710
the people in the photo will look hairy.

1306
00:43:55,280 --> 00:43:57,650
(Hairy?)

1307
00:43:57,650 --> 00:43:59,220
- They'll look hairy. - All right.

1308
00:43:59,220 --> 00:44:01,220
Move to your positions,

1309
00:44:01,220 --> 00:44:03,920
- and the final race will start. - Let's go!

1310
00:44:06,660 --> 00:44:08,360
(They enter Hades' Otherworld.)

1311
00:44:08,360 --> 00:44:09,630
This is creepy.

1312
00:44:13,270 --> 00:44:14,300
I'm stressed out.

1313
00:44:15,670 --> 00:44:18,340
Give me a second. I'm too scared.

1314
00:44:18,340 --> 00:44:20,440
(How am I going to go in?)

1315
00:44:22,070 --> 00:44:24,640
(She notices something.)

1316
00:44:26,180 --> 00:44:28,380
(An ugly toad ghost?)

1317
00:44:28,950 --> 00:44:30,150
(They don't care about Hades anymore.)

1318
00:44:30,150 --> 00:44:31,350
What is this?

1319
00:44:31,350 --> 00:44:33,050
(Everyone is on edge.)

1320
00:44:33,050 --> 00:44:34,420
- What is this? - Lee Kwang Soo.

1321
00:44:36,860 --> 00:44:40,460
(There's no one else in the hallway, but someone calls his name.)

1322
00:44:41,630 --> 00:44:42,790
Haha.

1323
00:44:44,060 --> 00:44:45,730
- Lee Kwang Soo. - Gosh.

1324
00:44:45,730 --> 00:44:46,870
(Lee Kwang Soo.)

1325
00:44:46,970 --> 00:44:49,230
(Kwang Soo swears at Se Chan.)

1326
00:44:49,370 --> 00:44:50,840
- Sorry. - Why are you so scared?

1327
00:44:50,840 --> 00:44:52,270
- Sorry. - I just called your name.

1328
00:44:52,270 --> 00:44:54,170
- I thought we've started. - Not yet.

1329
00:44:54,170 --> 00:44:55,470
(The toad ghost disappears.)

1330
00:44:55,640 --> 00:44:58,040
(It's a frog ghost this time.)

1331
00:44:59,810 --> 00:45:02,780
When others make that sound, they really sound like ghosts.

1332
00:45:03,220 --> 00:45:04,480
But when So Min does it,

1333
00:45:04,850 --> 00:45:06,690
she sounds like a crazy person.

1334
00:45:06,690 --> 00:45:07,920
It's even scarier.

1335
00:45:09,090 --> 00:45:10,220
He's saying something bad about me.

1336
00:45:10,520 --> 00:45:12,190
He is, right?

1337
00:45:12,520 --> 00:45:14,960
I think Hades...

1338
00:45:14,960 --> 00:45:16,160
(Hades is still veiled in mystery.)

1339
00:45:17,560 --> 00:45:19,560
It's either Kwang Soo...

1340
00:45:19,600 --> 00:45:20,830
or Dong Il.

1341
00:45:20,830 --> 00:45:22,230
(Suk Jin thinks it's either Kwang Soo or Dong Il.)

1342
00:45:22,570 --> 00:45:24,870
Dong Il keeps pretending...

1343
00:45:24,870 --> 00:45:26,410
he doesn't know the rules.

1344
00:45:26,410 --> 00:45:29,310
It's a little unnatural.

1345
00:45:29,710 --> 00:45:31,940
Seong Woo is a little suspicious.

1346
00:45:32,940 --> 00:45:34,150
Something about him doesn't feel right.

1347
00:45:34,150 --> 00:45:35,550
(Something about him doesn't feel right.)

1348
00:45:35,850 --> 00:45:37,320
I think it's Seong Woo.

1349
00:45:37,320 --> 00:45:38,550
(Seong Woo is suspect number 3 for Hades.)

1350
00:45:38,550 --> 00:45:42,520
It's either Dong Il or Jae Suk.

1351
00:45:43,890 --> 00:45:47,660
(Jae Suk is also being suspected to be Hades.)

1352
00:45:47,890 --> 00:45:50,160
I don't care about Hades. This is way too creepy.

1353
00:45:50,500 --> 00:45:52,160
Gosh, this is not good.

1354
00:45:52,930 --> 00:45:54,100
It's driving me crazy.

1355
00:45:54,170 --> 00:45:55,300
All right.

1356
00:45:55,830 --> 00:45:58,900
I'm Poseidon.

1357
00:45:58,900 --> 00:46:00,110
So I can do this.

1358
00:46:00,110 --> 00:46:01,030
(What? Is Ji Hyo Poseidon?)

1359
00:46:09,870 --> 00:46:12,470
(Right before today's shoot)

1360
00:46:12,470 --> 00:46:15,100
You two are deities disguised as humans.

1361
00:46:15,100 --> 00:46:16,610
(You two are deities disguised as humans.)

1362
00:46:16,610 --> 00:46:19,410
Ji Hyo, you are Poseidon, the deity of the sea.

1363
00:46:20,480 --> 00:46:23,080
(Ji Hyo is Poseidon, who works with Zeus to find Hades.)

1364
00:46:23,080 --> 00:46:25,280
I have too many candidates for Hades.

1365
00:46:26,320 --> 00:46:29,120
Dong Il, Seong Woo,

1366
00:46:29,320 --> 00:46:31,420
Jae Suk, and Kwang Soo.

1367
00:46:31,420 --> 00:46:32,760
(Dong Il, Seong Woo, Jae Suk, Kwang Soo)

1368
00:46:33,390 --> 00:46:34,760
This is driving me crazy.

1369
00:46:34,760 --> 00:46:35,790
(Who on earth is Hades?)

1370
00:46:35,960 --> 00:46:36,960
Five,

1371
00:46:37,290 --> 00:46:38,360
four,

1372
00:46:38,630 --> 00:46:39,960
three,

1373
00:46:39,960 --> 00:46:41,100
two.

1374
00:46:41,100 --> 00:46:42,230
The race starts.

1375
00:46:42,700 --> 00:46:46,240
(The race starts.)

1376
00:46:50,810 --> 00:46:54,510
(In this place are the hints that will be the key of this race.)

1377
00:46:56,610 --> 00:46:57,950
(However,)

1378
00:46:57,950 --> 00:47:00,250
(no one is coming out.)

1379
00:47:00,880 --> 00:47:03,920
This place is so red.

1380
00:47:04,450 --> 00:47:07,060
(Ji Hyo is Poseidon, a target of Hades.)

1381
00:47:08,260 --> 00:47:09,290
My goodness.

1382
00:47:09,290 --> 00:47:10,830
(She gathers up her courage and begins to look for the hints.)

1383
00:47:12,860 --> 00:47:15,060
Gosh, I really don't want to go in.

1384
00:47:15,570 --> 00:47:16,600
(This place definitely looks haunted.)

1385
00:47:16,600 --> 00:47:18,000
I really don't want to go in.

1386
00:47:21,040 --> 00:47:22,140
(Bang)

1387
00:47:22,870 --> 00:47:24,940
(Tiny bang sounds are enough to make her scared.)

1388
00:47:26,910 --> 00:47:28,040
Is this how it's going to be?

1389
00:47:28,480 --> 00:47:31,010
(Why is she scolding the cameraman?)

1390
00:47:31,210 --> 00:47:33,850
(She approaches the suspicious well.)

1391
00:47:33,850 --> 00:47:35,690
(She gets startled by herself.)

1392
00:47:37,790 --> 00:47:38,860
What?

1393
00:47:38,860 --> 00:47:40,690
(Is there a ghost inside?)

1394
00:47:43,790 --> 00:47:45,930
(The is a ghost over here.)

1395
00:47:46,860 --> 00:47:49,400
(Screaming)

1396
00:47:52,200 --> 00:47:54,200
(Running)

1397
00:47:55,810 --> 00:47:58,540
(The deity of the sea gets scared very easily.)

1398
00:47:59,510 --> 00:48:01,180
I might die...

1399
00:48:01,180 --> 00:48:03,180
before I catch Hades.

1400
00:48:04,380 --> 00:48:05,780
(Another coward is on the search.)

1401
00:48:05,780 --> 00:48:06,880
My goodness.

1402
00:48:11,420 --> 00:48:12,590
I know you are going to get up.

1403
00:48:12,590 --> 00:48:14,120
Hurry up and get up.

1404
00:48:15,120 --> 00:48:17,690
(It's a strange night-duty room.)

1405
00:48:18,330 --> 00:48:20,530
(There is a suspicious cabinet...)

1406
00:48:20,530 --> 00:48:23,700
(and an even more suspicious looking security guard.)

1407
00:48:24,530 --> 00:48:27,400
(I will stay far from that man.)

1408
00:48:29,640 --> 00:48:31,470
(Shouting)

1409
00:48:31,470 --> 00:48:32,810
Dong Il.

1410
00:48:33,710 --> 00:48:35,580
(It's me.)

1411
00:48:36,450 --> 00:48:37,480
Gosh!

1412
00:48:39,150 --> 00:48:41,580
(Screaming)

1413
00:48:42,190 --> 00:48:44,320
(Please save me.)

1414
00:48:44,490 --> 00:48:46,260
(What did So Min see inside the cabinet?)

1415
00:48:47,260 --> 00:48:48,930
Dong Il, look at that.

1416
00:48:48,930 --> 00:48:50,790
That was so scary.

1417
00:48:51,090 --> 00:48:52,700
(Crying)

1418
00:48:52,700 --> 00:48:54,060
Dong Il, look at that.

1419
00:48:54,060 --> 00:48:55,700
I was so startled.

1420
00:48:55,700 --> 00:48:57,930
This is too much.

1421
00:48:57,930 --> 00:48:59,070
This is...

1422
00:48:59,070 --> 00:49:01,270
(Screaming)

1423
00:49:01,800 --> 00:49:03,940
(How can I help you?)

1424
00:49:04,410 --> 00:49:06,810
(He is excited by So Min's reaction.)

1425
00:49:06,910 --> 00:49:11,150
I was so startled.

1426
00:49:11,810 --> 00:49:13,380
I guess these days...

1427
00:49:13,380 --> 00:49:15,920
- I was so scared. - ghosts carry cellphones.

1428
00:49:15,920 --> 00:49:17,750
(Embarrassed)

1429
00:49:18,190 --> 00:49:19,760
Your eyes must hurt.

1430
00:49:19,760 --> 00:49:20,890
Hold on.

1431
00:49:20,890 --> 00:49:22,930
- There must be an envelope. - I don't think it's here.

1432
00:49:23,230 --> 00:49:24,390
This isn't the room.

1433
00:49:24,390 --> 00:49:26,330
I don't think it's here.

1434
00:49:27,600 --> 00:49:29,070
(Where are the hints on Hades?)

1435
00:49:29,070 --> 00:49:30,130
My goodness.

1436
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:34,640
(This person is busy looking for the hints.)

1437
00:49:34,640 --> 00:49:37,710
(Hye Jun looks around and opens the door carefully.)

1438
00:49:38,810 --> 00:49:41,440
(There are various items scattered around the room.)

1439
00:49:42,650 --> 00:49:44,980
(She enters cautiously to find a hint.)

1440
00:49:44,980 --> 00:49:48,080
(She reckons there is a hint inside a box.)

1441
00:49:49,020 --> 00:49:53,020
(She opens all the boxes in the room.)

1442
00:49:55,830 --> 00:49:57,560
(Peek-a-boo)

1443
00:49:58,960 --> 00:50:01,730
(Don't touch my boxes.)

1444
00:50:03,930 --> 00:50:05,470
(She forgets about the hints...)

1445
00:50:05,470 --> 00:50:07,900
(and runs away.)

1446
00:50:08,240 --> 00:50:09,340
I am so scared.

1447
00:50:09,340 --> 00:50:11,010
(Her legs give out.)

1448
00:50:11,670 --> 00:50:13,810
(She collects herself.)

1449
00:50:13,810 --> 00:50:15,080
Hold on.

1450
00:50:15,080 --> 00:50:16,210
Did she go back inside?

1451
00:50:16,210 --> 00:50:17,980
(There is one box she hasn't opened yet.)

1452
00:50:17,980 --> 00:50:20,580
Don't come out.

1453
00:50:21,250 --> 00:50:22,450
Excuse me.

1454
00:50:22,920 --> 00:50:24,190
Excuse me.

1455
00:50:24,650 --> 00:50:25,920
(She enters the room again to check the last box.)

1456
00:50:25,920 --> 00:50:26,960
The hint...

1457
00:50:29,660 --> 00:50:31,130
(Peek-a-boo)

1458
00:50:32,660 --> 00:50:34,830
(She gets the box.)

1459
00:50:34,830 --> 00:50:36,670
(I found a hint.)

1460
00:50:38,130 --> 00:50:39,400
(She almost fell by in her attempt to tease the ghost.)

1461
00:50:39,400 --> 00:50:40,670
(Be careful.)

1462
00:50:41,740 --> 00:50:43,610
(She leaves the room happily after receiving a hint.)

1463
00:50:44,140 --> 00:50:47,180
(Which hint did Hye Jun receive after the struggle?)

1464
00:50:47,180 --> 00:50:49,080
(Hades uses his or her own name.)

1465
00:50:49,850 --> 00:50:52,880
(The hint rules out Haha since he doesn't use his own name.)

1466
00:50:53,580 --> 00:50:54,680
It rules out Haha.

1467
00:50:54,680 --> 00:50:57,090
(Seven candidates for Hades remain.)

1468
00:50:58,220 --> 00:51:00,320
We need to enter every room, right?

1469
00:51:01,190 --> 00:51:03,660
(He is touring every room.)

1470
00:51:04,690 --> 00:51:06,400
It's scary in a strange way.

1471
00:51:08,060 --> 00:51:11,870
(He approaches the cabinet with his eyes on the ghost.)

1472
00:51:12,070 --> 00:51:13,570
For goodness' sake.

1473
00:51:14,440 --> 00:51:16,570
(He pretends to be strong as he runs away.)

1474
00:51:19,210 --> 00:51:20,410
Someone is in here.

1475
00:51:20,410 --> 00:51:22,350
(Who was startled just now?)

1476
00:51:22,350 --> 00:51:24,550
Was that you, Seong Woo?

1477
00:51:24,550 --> 00:51:25,820
My goodness.

1478
00:51:25,950 --> 00:51:28,480
- Hold on. - There was a loud bang.

1479
00:51:28,480 --> 00:51:29,550
(He pretends to be calm.)

1480
00:51:29,850 --> 00:51:32,490
A hint must be where the ghost is.

1481
00:51:32,490 --> 00:51:33,590
That's how it usually is.

1482
00:51:33,590 --> 00:51:35,860
(Ji Hyo goes towards the ghost instead of Seong Woo.)

1483
00:51:35,860 --> 00:51:37,030
This is driving me crazy.

1484
00:51:37,030 --> 00:51:38,390
(What?)

1485
00:51:39,060 --> 00:51:41,960
(She finds a hint near the ghost like Jong Kook said.)

1486
00:51:41,960 --> 00:51:43,030
Did you find something?

1487
00:51:43,030 --> 00:51:44,930
Let's go.

1488
00:51:45,270 --> 00:51:46,770
Seong Woo is a fool.

1489
00:51:47,400 --> 00:51:49,010
I think...

1490
00:51:49,470 --> 00:51:51,670
(He gets startled by the door.)

1491
00:51:52,540 --> 00:51:54,810
(He is playing by himself as he searches the room.)

1492
00:51:55,650 --> 00:51:57,680
- Let's see it. - Jong Kook.

1493
00:51:57,680 --> 00:51:58,950
(The hint they found behind Seong Woo's back says,)

1494
00:51:58,950 --> 00:52:00,850
(Hades is a man.)

1495
00:52:01,520 --> 00:52:04,290
(The hint rules out So Min from the candidates for Hades.)

1496
00:52:05,020 --> 00:52:06,760
The ghosts in this room...

1497
00:52:06,760 --> 00:52:08,390
aren't very scary.

1498
00:52:08,620 --> 00:52:10,390
I guess we should jump rope.

1499
00:52:11,030 --> 00:52:13,100
(Two ghosts are turning the rope.)

1500
00:52:13,100 --> 00:52:14,200
Do we jump rope?

1501
00:52:14,960 --> 00:52:16,300
I guess we should do this.

1502
00:52:16,300 --> 00:52:17,970
- Go, Se Chan. - You should go first.

1503
00:52:18,270 --> 00:52:19,540
How many times should I jump?

1504
00:52:19,540 --> 00:52:20,540
Go.

1505
00:52:20,540 --> 00:52:21,800
Go and jump rope.

1506
00:52:22,070 --> 00:52:24,340
(Se Chan tries jump roping.)

1507
00:52:25,170 --> 00:52:27,080
(Little child, little child, turn around)

1508
00:52:27,080 --> 00:52:28,240
Turn around.

1509
00:52:28,240 --> 00:52:32,380
Turn around, turn around, and touch the ground

1510
00:52:32,580 --> 00:52:34,620
Touch the ground, touch the ground

1511
00:52:34,620 --> 00:52:36,790
Put your arms up

1512
00:52:36,790 --> 00:52:40,490
Put your arms up, put your arms up, and leave

1513
00:52:40,490 --> 00:52:42,330
- Leave. - He did it.

1514
00:52:42,330 --> 00:52:43,960
(Se Chan did as the ghosts asked.)

1515
00:52:43,960 --> 00:52:45,030
- It's a hint. - He gets a hint.

1516
00:52:45,030 --> 00:52:46,460
(It's a hint!)

1517
00:52:46,830 --> 00:52:48,700
Come here. Bring it over here.

1518
00:52:48,830 --> 00:52:50,230
We are a team.

1519
00:52:51,730 --> 00:52:54,970
(Se Chan checks the hint first.)

1520
00:52:54,970 --> 00:52:56,670
(What is this?)

1521
00:52:57,070 --> 00:52:58,640
(Why is he so startled?)

1522
00:52:58,640 --> 00:53:00,440
Share it with us. Don't be like that.

1523
00:53:00,780 --> 00:53:04,050
(He shares the hint with the other cowards.)

1524
00:53:04,050 --> 00:53:05,210
What is this?

1525
00:53:05,210 --> 00:53:06,420
(If you are a deity, beware of April 5.)

1526
00:53:06,420 --> 00:53:08,350
(It's a hint about all 3 deities.)

1527
00:53:08,350 --> 00:53:09,920
- April fifth? - What is it?

1528
00:53:10,590 --> 00:53:11,920
- What is it? - Is it someone's birthday?

1529
00:53:12,150 --> 00:53:13,960
- It's someone's birthday, right? - No, no. April fifth is...

1530
00:53:13,960 --> 00:53:15,160
- Arbor Day. - Arbor Day.

1531
00:53:15,490 --> 00:53:16,790
It's when you plant trees.

1532
00:53:16,790 --> 00:53:18,190
(A deity should beware of Arbor day?)

1533
00:53:18,190 --> 00:53:19,400
What about Arbor Day?

1534
00:53:19,930 --> 00:53:22,030
When is Dong Il's birthday?

1535
00:53:22,030 --> 00:53:23,300
I think it's in April.

1536
00:53:25,000 --> 00:53:27,070
The red light must indicate something.

1537
00:53:27,070 --> 00:53:28,770
I think there is something inside the room.

1538
00:53:28,770 --> 00:53:30,340
- This room? - What should we do?

1539
00:53:30,340 --> 00:53:31,370
What should we do?

1540
00:53:31,370 --> 00:53:32,810
- My goodness. - This room...

1541
00:53:32,810 --> 00:53:34,310
What should we do?

1542
00:53:34,310 --> 00:53:36,150
It's a station for a bus that goes to the Otherworld.

1543
00:53:38,210 --> 00:53:40,180
(The Grim Reaper waits at the bus station.)

1544
00:53:40,250 --> 00:53:41,680
(Otherworld, Human World, Heavens)

1545
00:53:42,080 --> 00:53:44,020
- What? - Lee Kwang Soo.

1546
00:53:45,450 --> 00:53:47,020
Song Ji Hyo.

1547
00:53:47,020 --> 00:53:48,290
- He called your name. - Why me?

1548
00:53:48,290 --> 00:53:49,390
(Song Ji Hyo)

1549
00:53:49,390 --> 00:53:52,700
(Why did he call my name?)

1550
00:53:52,700 --> 00:53:53,960
To the Otherworld.

1551
00:53:55,330 --> 00:53:56,670
- My goodness. - Seong Woo.

1552
00:53:56,670 --> 00:53:58,300
(As soon as the Grim Reaper finishes talking...)

1553
00:53:58,300 --> 00:54:00,700
(Is that another Grim Reaper?)

1554
00:54:00,700 --> 00:54:03,610
I just followed the crowd.

1555
00:54:04,070 --> 00:54:06,340
Seong Woo, are you carrying that arm as a weapon?

1556
00:54:07,280 --> 00:54:09,180
It puts my heart at ease.

1557
00:54:09,610 --> 00:54:11,450
There must be a hint inside the bus.

1558
00:54:11,450 --> 00:54:12,880
(There must be a hint inside the bus.)

1559
00:54:13,050 --> 00:54:15,050
- Seong Woo. - Jong Kook, there might be a hint.

1560
00:54:15,750 --> 00:54:17,650
(Ji Hyo suddenly comes over.)

1561
00:54:17,650 --> 00:54:18,990
(Swiping)

1562
00:54:20,590 --> 00:54:22,760
(While Seong Woo is focused on the bus,)

1563
00:54:22,760 --> 00:54:25,900
(she gets a hint from the Grim Reaper.)

1564
00:54:25,900 --> 00:54:27,000
There's nothing here.

1565
00:54:28,330 --> 00:54:30,430
(Seong Woo doesn't realize that Ji Hyo found a hint.)

1566
00:54:30,430 --> 00:54:32,370
(He focuses on the bus.)

1567
00:54:32,370 --> 00:54:33,970
He is still looking for a hint.

1568
00:54:33,970 --> 00:54:35,500
(He is so funny.)

1569
00:54:35,500 --> 00:54:38,740
He's the first to enter and the first to search the room,

1570
00:54:38,910 --> 00:54:42,240
but he still can't find a hint.

1571
00:54:42,480 --> 00:54:43,850
He can't find a hint.

1572
00:54:44,480 --> 00:54:46,220
Why is he so clueless?

1573
00:54:47,750 --> 00:54:48,850
Seong Woo.

1574
00:54:49,950 --> 00:54:52,050
(He walks towards Jong Kook and Ji Hyo.)

1575
00:54:52,050 --> 00:54:53,120
Is this a hint?

1576
00:54:54,760 --> 00:54:55,830
Let's go.

1577
00:54:56,130 --> 00:54:57,960
- What should we do? - "Information Protection Act".

1578
00:54:58,490 --> 00:55:00,530
"Entry number 12,504".

1579
00:55:00,530 --> 00:55:01,800
(This can't be about Hades.)

1580
00:55:01,800 --> 00:55:02,970
Where are the hints?

1581
00:55:04,370 --> 00:55:06,440
(He finds a bag this time.)

1582
00:55:07,100 --> 00:55:08,440
This must be it.

1583
00:55:10,270 --> 00:55:12,580
(It's a staff member's sock.)

1584
00:55:12,580 --> 00:55:14,340
(I was wrong.)

1585
00:55:15,780 --> 00:55:17,280
(The hint they found behind Seong Woo's back says...)

1586
00:55:17,280 --> 00:55:18,650
Those are Chinese words...

1587
00:55:18,650 --> 00:55:20,680
- for "Human" and "10". - 10?

1588
00:55:20,680 --> 00:55:21,920
(If you are a deity, beware of 'Human' plus '10'.)

1589
00:55:21,920 --> 00:55:24,890
(What does the hint that starts with "If you are a deity" mean?)

1590
00:55:26,320 --> 00:55:27,920
(Haha has been ruled out from the candidates for Hades.)

1591
00:55:27,920 --> 00:55:29,090
I am sorry.

1592
00:55:29,090 --> 00:55:32,190
(He leaves the 3 cowards and looks for the hints by himself.)

1593
00:55:32,190 --> 00:55:33,230
It's here.

1594
00:55:33,230 --> 00:55:35,660
(He finds a hint.)

1595
00:55:35,830 --> 00:55:37,330
Thank you.

1596
00:55:37,730 --> 00:55:38,900
Thank you.

1597
00:55:40,500 --> 00:55:41,600
Leave!

1598
00:55:41,600 --> 00:55:43,140
(The ghost is annoyed.)

1599
00:55:43,840 --> 00:55:46,580
(He calms his heart and checks the hint again.)

1600
00:55:46,580 --> 00:55:48,010
(Find Hades' 'Blank' chair, put a deity's name tag on it,)

1601
00:55:48,010 --> 00:55:49,280
(and burn it to eliminate that deity.)

1602
00:55:49,280 --> 00:55:52,280
"Find Hades' 'Blank' chair, put a deity's name tag on it..."

1603
00:55:53,050 --> 00:55:54,580
(Do they need to find Hades' "Blank" chair?)

1604
00:55:54,580 --> 00:55:55,850
This is...

1605
00:55:55,850 --> 00:55:57,390
(Do they need to find Hades' "Blank" chair?)

1606
00:55:58,220 --> 00:56:02,320
(What could be the thing Ji Hyo, a deity, should beware of?)

1607
00:56:02,320 --> 00:56:04,260
What is April fifth?

1608
00:56:04,830 --> 00:56:06,500
April fifth is Arbor Day.

1609
00:56:06,500 --> 00:56:08,930
(Confused)

1610
00:56:10,200 --> 00:56:11,330
(Then what do other hints mean?)

1611
00:56:11,330 --> 00:56:12,640
Right?

1612
00:56:12,800 --> 00:56:14,370
April fifth is Arbor Day.

1613
00:56:14,370 --> 00:56:16,270
(If you are a deity, beware of April 5th.)

1614
00:56:16,270 --> 00:56:18,170
(If you are a deity, beware of 'Human' plus '10'.)

1615
00:56:18,170 --> 00:56:19,510
(Jong Kook knows the two hints that go, "If you are a deity...")

1616
00:56:19,510 --> 00:56:21,040
This is driving me crazy. Hold on.

1617
00:56:21,580 --> 00:56:23,480
"Beware of April fifth."

1618
00:56:23,480 --> 00:56:24,880
(He begins to solve the meaning of April 5th.)

1619
00:56:24,880 --> 00:56:25,980
April?

1620
00:56:27,650 --> 00:56:31,020
(Did Jong Kook figure it out?)

1621
00:56:34,160 --> 00:56:35,160
(April 5)

1622
00:56:35,160 --> 00:56:37,530
Arbor Day. It equals "Wood".

1623
00:56:37,730 --> 00:56:40,160
(Arbor Day, Wood)

1624
00:56:40,160 --> 00:56:42,400
(Wood)

1625
00:56:42,400 --> 00:56:43,400
(Wooden)

1626
00:56:43,400 --> 00:56:45,400
What should I do now?

1627
00:56:45,400 --> 00:56:47,300
(That's why the deities should beware of wooden chairs.)

1628
00:56:47,770 --> 00:56:51,310
"Find Hades' 'Blank' chair, put a deity's name tag on it..."

1629
00:56:51,310 --> 00:56:52,370
(Putting a deity's name tag on Hades' wooden chair...)

1630
00:56:52,370 --> 00:56:53,480
(and burning it eliminates the deity.)

1631
00:56:54,680 --> 00:56:57,750
(Haha figured out how to eliminate a deity.)

1632
00:56:59,110 --> 00:57:01,980
(He shares the information with other members.)

1633
00:57:01,980 --> 00:57:03,020
That's incredible.

1634
00:57:03,020 --> 00:57:04,890
"Hades' wooden chair".

1635
00:57:04,890 --> 00:57:06,860
"Burn it to eliminate that deity."

1636
00:57:06,860 --> 00:57:08,660
Where did you find these hints?

1637
00:57:08,660 --> 00:57:09,760
My goodness.

1638
00:57:09,760 --> 00:57:10,760
(Find Hades' wooden chair and the incinerator.)

1639
00:57:11,960 --> 00:57:13,360
We need to find the wooden chair.

1640
00:57:14,030 --> 00:57:15,460
These aren't wooden chairs.

1641
00:57:15,460 --> 00:57:17,370
(There are too many wooden chairs inside the building.)

1642
00:57:18,130 --> 00:57:19,130
No way.

1643
00:57:19,130 --> 00:57:21,100
(Which one is Hades' wooden chair?)

1644
00:57:21,100 --> 00:57:22,770
- Isn't that the incinerator? - Gosh, you startled me.

1645
00:57:22,770 --> 00:57:24,640
Maybe we have to take the chair over there.

1646
00:57:24,640 --> 00:57:28,110
Wait. We need to find a wooden chair we can stick a name tag on.

1647
00:57:28,110 --> 00:57:30,150
(Put Hades' name tag on the chair and burn it to eliminate Hades.)

1648
00:57:30,150 --> 00:57:34,280
Since we need to burn it, the chair won't be that big.

1649
00:57:35,020 --> 00:57:36,790
(After sharing the hints,)

1650
00:57:36,820 --> 00:57:40,460
(Haha begins to look for Hades' chair.)

1651
00:57:40,460 --> 00:57:42,120
(At that moment,)

1652
00:57:42,890 --> 00:57:46,260
(someone quietly chases after Haha.)

1653
00:57:46,260 --> 00:57:49,370
(When he looks back, it's too late!)

1654
00:57:49,370 --> 00:57:50,830
What? What?

1655
00:57:51,030 --> 00:57:52,670
(Ripping)

1656
00:57:52,670 --> 00:57:54,200
Hades?

1657
00:57:54,200 --> 00:57:57,310
A human, Haha, is out.

1658
00:57:57,310 --> 00:57:59,480
(A human, Haha, is out.)

1659
00:57:59,480 --> 00:58:00,480
(Is Haha out?)

1660
00:58:00,480 --> 00:58:01,480
What?

1661
00:58:02,210 --> 00:58:04,980
No way. I promised to protect him.

1662
00:58:05,150 --> 00:58:06,250
Haha is out.

1663
00:58:06,250 --> 00:58:07,350
- Haha? - Yes.

1664
00:58:07,350 --> 00:58:09,050
Haha knows too much.

1665
00:58:09,450 --> 00:58:11,850
- Hold on. - Who took him out?

1666
00:58:11,850 --> 00:58:15,060
(Who could be Hades, the deity who eliminated Haha?)

1667
00:58:17,160 --> 00:58:18,390
There must be something in here.

1668
00:58:18,390 --> 00:58:20,200
(Hades' identity is still a mystery.)

1669
00:58:20,400 --> 00:58:23,130
(The candidates for Hades meet during their search for hints.)

1670
00:58:23,130 --> 00:58:25,130
Gosh, that startled me.

1671
00:58:25,830 --> 00:58:26,870
What is this?

1672
00:58:26,870 --> 00:58:29,840
(Everything is upside down in this room.)

1673
00:58:31,870 --> 00:58:33,880
I am reminded of a movie I was in.

1674
00:58:34,580 --> 00:58:36,110
There must be something in here.

1675
00:58:36,110 --> 00:58:37,280
(Crouching)

1676
00:58:37,280 --> 00:58:38,350
For goodness' sake.

1677
00:58:38,350 --> 00:58:40,020
(That startled me.)

1678
00:58:42,720 --> 00:58:46,260
(Thanks to Seong Woo's prank, he finds a hint.)

1679
00:58:46,260 --> 00:58:48,590
You need to share that.

1680
00:58:48,660 --> 00:58:50,630
Let me read it first.

1681
00:58:51,260 --> 00:58:53,560
If this is a hint about Poseidon or Zeus...

1682
00:58:53,560 --> 00:58:55,200
You might be Hades.

1683
00:58:56,630 --> 00:58:58,370
(Find Hades' 'Blank' chair, put a deity's name tag on it,)

1684
00:58:58,370 --> 00:59:00,140
(and burn it to eliminate that deity.)

1685
00:59:01,070 --> 00:59:02,100
What is it?

1686
00:59:02,100 --> 00:59:03,140
(Kwang Soo figured out how to eliminate a deity.)

1687
00:59:03,140 --> 00:59:04,170
This is a useful one.

1688
00:59:04,370 --> 00:59:06,380
I showed you a useful one earlier!

1689
00:59:06,380 --> 00:59:07,380
- Hey! - This is...

1690
00:59:07,380 --> 00:59:09,510
I showed you a useful one earlier!

1691
00:59:11,050 --> 00:59:13,750
You don't know much about the rules of Running Man, right?

1692
00:59:14,250 --> 00:59:16,890
I will share them with you.

1693
00:59:16,890 --> 00:59:18,450
(He says it to Kwang Soo.)

1694
00:59:19,220 --> 00:59:21,560
(He is the one who is visiting Running Man for the first time.)

1695
00:59:21,890 --> 00:59:24,630
- I have done this for 10 years. - All right. I was joking.

1696
00:59:24,630 --> 00:59:25,630
What's the hint?

1697
00:59:25,630 --> 00:59:26,730
(Pressuring)

1698
00:59:26,730 --> 00:59:28,560
- Come on. - Hades'...

1699
00:59:28,560 --> 00:59:29,570
(Hades'...)

1700
00:59:29,900 --> 00:59:32,370
A pause means...

1701
00:59:32,370 --> 00:59:33,770
- You are lying. - you are making things up.

1702
00:59:33,770 --> 00:59:35,540
- Hades' name tag must be removed. - What?

1703
00:59:35,540 --> 00:59:37,610
Hades' name tag must be removed.

1704
00:59:38,140 --> 00:59:40,080
They said it's not about taking name tags.

1705
00:59:40,180 --> 00:59:41,380
Yes, it is.

1706
00:59:41,480 --> 00:59:42,750
They said it's not about that.

1707
00:59:42,750 --> 00:59:45,250
Are you saying the production crew lied to me?

1708
00:59:45,950 --> 00:59:46,980
Hades'...

1709
00:59:46,980 --> 00:59:47,980
(Kwang Soo is flustered.)

1710
00:59:47,980 --> 00:59:49,520
- Come here. - Come here.

1711
00:59:49,520 --> 00:59:50,650
(They explode.)

1712
00:59:51,290 --> 00:59:53,660
(Are you going to keep lying?)

1713
00:59:53,720 --> 00:59:55,120
- I am telling the truth. - You will be filming...

1714
00:59:55,120 --> 00:59:56,860
a movie with me, right?

1715
00:59:57,160 --> 00:59:59,090
We will also work together for "The Accidental Detective".

1716
00:59:59,900 --> 01:00:00,960
I will tell you.

1717
01:00:01,460 --> 01:00:03,470
Hades supposedly has a wooden chair.

1718
01:00:03,470 --> 01:00:05,830
- What? - Hades' chair.

1719
01:00:05,830 --> 01:00:06,840
Chair.

1720
01:00:06,840 --> 01:00:08,440
We need to find that chair.

1721
01:00:08,870 --> 01:00:10,370
- Is that the hint? - We need to put...

1722
01:00:10,970 --> 01:00:12,040
Hades' name tag...

1723
01:00:12,170 --> 01:00:13,480
on that chair.

1724
01:00:13,480 --> 01:00:15,940
We can put a name tag on that chair, right?

1725
01:00:15,940 --> 01:00:17,910
- That's right. - Then it must be made of velcro.

1726
01:00:18,810 --> 01:00:20,450
(Upon learning how to eliminate Hades,)

1727
01:00:20,450 --> 01:00:22,750
(Seong Woo suddenly heads somewhere.)

1728
01:00:23,650 --> 01:00:28,160
(The room Seong Woo entered upon learning the hint is...)

1729
01:00:29,360 --> 01:00:34,460
(the room of dolls with Annabelle.)

1730
01:00:41,070 --> 01:00:42,340
Do you want to play a game with me?

1731
01:00:42,470 --> 01:00:43,510
Yes.

1732
01:00:43,940 --> 01:00:45,840
Really? Press the doorbell.

1733
01:00:45,840 --> 01:00:47,380
If the door opens, you lose.

1734
01:00:48,140 --> 01:00:50,180
You can press once or many times.

1735
01:00:50,180 --> 01:00:51,510
It's a game of chance anyway.

1736
01:00:52,150 --> 01:00:53,850
- I will go first. - Sure.

1737
01:00:54,250 --> 01:00:55,850
(Seong Woo goes first.)

1738
01:00:55,850 --> 01:00:57,290
(Ringing)

1739
01:00:59,560 --> 01:01:01,820
(Ringing)

1740
01:01:02,730 --> 01:01:05,830
(The door of the haunted house opens.)

1741
01:01:06,660 --> 01:01:07,760
I lost.

1742
01:01:07,760 --> 01:01:08,760
Yes.

1743
01:01:08,860 --> 01:01:10,570
(Since Seong Woo won,)

1744
01:01:10,570 --> 01:01:13,270
(Annabelle gives him a gift.)

1745
01:01:14,570 --> 01:01:16,140
Pick one.

1746
01:01:16,140 --> 01:01:18,740
(There are members' name tags on the tray.)

1747
01:01:19,270 --> 01:01:22,750
(It's a chance to obtain a name tag without ripping it off the person.)

1748
01:01:23,410 --> 01:01:25,850
(Put a deity's name tag on the chair and burn it...)

1749
01:01:25,850 --> 01:01:28,350
(to take the deity out.)

1750
01:01:28,850 --> 01:01:30,390
(Find Hades' 'Blank' chair, put a deity's name tag on it,)

1751
01:01:30,390 --> 01:01:31,720
(and burn it to eliminate that deity.)

1752
01:01:33,160 --> 01:01:37,160
(Which name tag will Seong Woo choose?)

1753
01:01:37,160 --> 01:01:38,960
(After much consideration,)

1754
01:01:38,960 --> 01:01:42,260
(he picks Jong Kook's name tag.)

1755
01:01:43,170 --> 01:01:44,630
Can I take a look at them?

1756
01:01:45,600 --> 01:01:48,840
(He wants to take a look at the name tags.)

1757
01:01:49,040 --> 01:01:50,070
Please let me take a look.

1758
01:01:50,170 --> 01:01:51,570
Came back in 10 minutes.

1759
01:01:51,670 --> 01:01:52,670
10 minutes?

1760
01:01:52,670 --> 01:01:54,180
(Stealing)

1761
01:01:54,680 --> 01:01:57,510
(He steals in front of the ghost.)

1762
01:01:59,250 --> 01:02:00,280
(Grabbing)

1763
01:02:00,280 --> 01:02:01,580
I will come back in 10 minutes.

1764
01:02:02,050 --> 01:02:04,950
(He steals a second name tag while distracting the ghost.)

1765
01:02:05,190 --> 01:02:06,290
Seong Woo.

1766
01:02:07,160 --> 01:02:08,360
Put down the name tags.

1767
01:02:08,360 --> 01:02:09,530
(Put down the name tags.)

1768
01:02:10,290 --> 01:02:12,900
(He returns the two name tags.)

1769
01:02:12,900 --> 01:02:15,100
I will come back.

1770
01:02:15,100 --> 01:02:17,000
(He leaves the room with one name tag.)

1771
01:02:17,000 --> 01:02:19,270
(Hesitant)

1772
01:02:21,400 --> 01:02:22,840
(The lobby is empty...)

1773
01:02:22,840 --> 01:02:26,480
(except for someone who is moving suspiciously.)

1774
01:02:26,810 --> 01:02:28,780
(Who is that?)

1775
01:02:29,680 --> 01:02:31,980
(It's Dong Il!)

1776
01:02:31,980 --> 01:02:36,250
(He approaches someone without a word.)

1777
01:02:37,290 --> 01:02:40,120
(He surprises a ghost that was hiding.)

1778
01:02:40,360 --> 01:02:43,030
(Dong Il isn't afraid of ghosts.)

1779
01:02:43,590 --> 01:02:46,300
(What is Dong Il doing?)

1780
01:02:47,930 --> 01:02:50,470
(It's the side effect of a scary experience.)

1781
01:02:50,470 --> 01:02:53,270
(A human turns into a ghost.)

1782
01:02:54,270 --> 01:02:57,070
(Jae Suk didn't find many hints.)

1783
01:02:57,140 --> 01:02:58,210
What is this?

1784
01:02:59,780 --> 01:03:01,280
(In front of the keys,)

1785
01:03:01,280 --> 01:03:04,650
(he finds a hint!)

1786
01:03:07,380 --> 01:03:08,880
(Zeus has a 4 in his or her birthday.)

1787
01:03:08,880 --> 01:03:10,250
(Jae Suk, Kwang Soo, Dong Il, Jong Kook, and So Min)

1788
01:03:10,650 --> 01:03:13,920
(One of them is Zeus!)

1789
01:03:13,920 --> 01:03:16,760
(Jae Suk is the first person to find a hint about Zeus.)

1790
01:03:17,460 --> 01:03:21,000
(The race ends if Hades eliminates Zeus and Poseidon.)

1791
01:03:21,000 --> 01:03:22,260
(What?)

1792
01:03:23,300 --> 01:03:25,830
(He finds Dong Il, a candidate for Zeus.)

1793
01:03:26,570 --> 01:03:29,770
(Soon after Dong Il enters the room,)

1794
01:03:29,770 --> 01:03:33,380
(Jae Suk enters the same room.)

1795
01:03:33,910 --> 01:03:35,140
(Ripping)

1796
01:03:35,140 --> 01:03:37,010
(What?)

1797
01:03:37,010 --> 01:03:40,150
A human, Sung Dong Il, is out.

1798
01:03:41,350 --> 01:03:42,350
Really?

1799
01:03:42,350 --> 01:03:43,520
(Dong Il is out?)

1800
01:03:43,520 --> 01:03:44,520
A human?

1801
01:03:44,620 --> 01:03:46,460
A human, Sung Dong Il, is out.

1802
01:03:46,460 --> 01:03:47,460
Okay.

1803
01:03:47,460 --> 01:03:49,860
(Seong Woo heads somewhere upon hearing the news.)

1804
01:03:49,860 --> 01:03:50,860
Is this for real?

1805
01:03:50,860 --> 01:03:52,290
- Seong Woo, where have you been? - Seong Woo.

1806
01:03:52,290 --> 01:03:54,230
I was going to revisit Annabelle's room.

1807
01:03:54,400 --> 01:03:56,100
I am fairly certain Hades is 1 of the 3.

1808
01:03:56,100 --> 01:03:57,130
Who?

1809
01:03:57,600 --> 01:03:59,840
(Who does he think Hades is?)

1810
01:03:59,840 --> 01:04:01,940
It's not Dong Il.

1811
01:04:01,940 --> 01:04:03,270
- Why not? - Did you find a hint?

1812
01:04:03,270 --> 01:04:04,640
He passed away just now.

1813
01:04:05,070 --> 01:04:06,140
- What? - What?

1814
01:04:06,140 --> 01:04:07,580
(Dong Il passed away just now.)

1815
01:04:07,580 --> 01:04:09,380
- Is he out? - Oh, is "out" the proper term?

1816
01:04:09,380 --> 01:04:10,580
What?

1817
01:04:10,680 --> 01:04:12,650
(He is out.)

1818
01:04:12,650 --> 01:04:14,150
- I was so startled! - Seong Woo!

1819
01:04:14,150 --> 01:04:15,850
- I am sorry. - I was so startled!

1820
01:04:15,850 --> 01:04:17,850
- That came out wrong. - I almost cried.

1821
01:04:17,850 --> 01:04:20,390
You can't say something like that about people...

1822
01:04:20,420 --> 01:04:21,890
like Dong Il and Suk Jin.

1823
01:04:21,890 --> 01:04:23,030
I wouldn't like it either.

1824
01:04:23,030 --> 01:04:24,660
- I was so startled. - I am sorry.

1825
01:04:24,660 --> 01:04:25,730
What are you?

1826
01:04:25,730 --> 01:04:27,030
- What are you? - What?

1827
01:04:27,030 --> 01:04:28,560
What are you?

1828
01:04:28,560 --> 01:04:31,400
He is... Excuse me. You should sit down.

1829
01:04:32,100 --> 01:04:34,970
(The security ghost is standing inside a small cabinet.)

1830
01:04:34,970 --> 01:04:36,770
I am sorry. All along...

1831
01:04:36,770 --> 01:04:38,870
Should I shut the door? What should I do?

1832
01:04:38,870 --> 01:04:40,780
- Maybe I should shut the door. - Then he will be too hot.

1833
01:04:40,780 --> 01:04:41,880
- He will be too hot. - What should I do?

1834
01:04:41,880 --> 01:04:43,550
- Please sit here. - Come on out.

1835
01:04:43,550 --> 01:04:45,110
- All of us have seen you. - Please sit here.

1836
01:04:45,280 --> 01:04:47,280
I was so surprised.

1837
01:04:47,280 --> 01:04:48,550
- He was still doing that. - Please sit here.

1838
01:04:48,550 --> 01:04:50,120
- It's okay. - He is like a mannequin.

1839
01:04:50,120 --> 01:04:51,290
It's okay.

1840
01:04:51,290 --> 01:04:53,320
- It's really okay. - You should take a break.

1841
01:04:53,490 --> 01:04:55,820
Gosh, I had no idea.

1842
01:04:56,090 --> 01:04:58,230
Please lie down straight. You don't need to do that.

1843
01:04:58,590 --> 01:04:59,830
(Please lie down straight.)

1844
01:04:59,830 --> 01:05:01,760
- Please lie down straight. - You don't need to do that.

1845
01:05:02,030 --> 01:05:03,300
- Take a break. - He must be hot.

1846
01:05:03,300 --> 01:05:05,200
- It must have been hard. - Lie down.

1847
01:05:05,200 --> 01:05:06,570
- Seriously. - That's right.

1848
01:05:07,070 --> 01:05:09,670
I am sorry. We were so absorbed in the conversation.

1849
01:05:10,910 --> 01:05:14,280
Everyone, please pause.

1850
01:05:14,280 --> 01:05:16,780
(Everyone, please pause.)

1851
01:05:17,450 --> 01:05:18,880
(What is going on?)

1852
01:05:18,880 --> 01:05:19,920
Pause?

1853
01:05:20,980 --> 01:05:23,020
The photo studio is open.

1854
01:05:23,020 --> 01:05:24,350
(The photo studio is open.)

1855
01:05:24,720 --> 01:05:28,160
(The photo studio is finally open.)

1856
01:05:29,520 --> 01:05:31,990
(There is a special photo studio in the Otherworld?)

1857
01:05:33,030 --> 01:05:35,830
(The photo studio will open at when the time is right.)

1858
01:05:35,830 --> 01:05:38,130
(The 2 people who find the ticket can choose 1 other person each...)

1859
01:05:38,130 --> 01:05:40,400
(and enter the photo studio. Four people can enter.)

1860
01:05:41,370 --> 01:05:43,470
(When the 4 people get their photo taken,)

1861
01:05:43,470 --> 01:05:47,480
(it will look bright if one brother deity is among them.)

1862
01:05:48,540 --> 01:05:51,650
(The photo with Hades will look dark.)

1863
01:05:51,650 --> 01:05:53,720
(If both Hades and a brother deity are in the photo,)

1864
01:05:53,720 --> 01:05:55,750
(the people in the photo will look hairy.)

1865
01:05:55,750 --> 01:05:57,450
(Photo Studio)

1866
01:05:57,650 --> 01:05:59,350
Only those with the tickets can enter.

1867
01:05:59,550 --> 01:06:01,390
Only those with the tickets can enter.

1868
01:06:01,390 --> 01:06:03,090
For goodness' sake.

1869
01:06:04,990 --> 01:06:06,360
Who found the tickets?

1870
01:06:06,360 --> 01:06:07,760
(Who found the tickets?)

1871
01:06:07,760 --> 01:06:09,560
I don't have a ticket.

1872
01:06:09,770 --> 01:06:11,470
Who has a ticket?

1873
01:06:11,470 --> 01:06:13,340
- Who has a ticket? - I will choose a person.

1874
01:06:13,370 --> 01:06:14,540
- Do you have a ticket? - Do you have a ticket?

1875
01:06:15,000 --> 01:06:16,470
- Do you have a ticket? - Yes.

1876
01:06:18,370 --> 01:06:21,080
(Kwang Soo has 1 ticket.)

1877
01:06:22,380 --> 01:06:26,750
(He was looking for a hint in the hallway earlier...)

1878
01:06:26,750 --> 01:06:29,950
(when he came across a ticket.)

1879
01:06:30,820 --> 01:06:32,550
You need to include a human.

1880
01:06:32,590 --> 01:06:34,420
Include me since I'm human.

1881
01:06:34,820 --> 01:06:36,320
- I'm definitely human. - Seong Woo.

1882
01:06:36,390 --> 01:06:38,330
How about this? Seong Woo is definitely coming.

1883
01:06:38,660 --> 01:06:39,900
I'll go with Seong Woo...

1884
01:06:40,100 --> 01:06:41,560
and two humans.

1885
01:06:41,560 --> 01:06:42,700
Two humans?

1886
01:06:42,760 --> 01:06:44,270
You can only take one person.

1887
01:06:45,030 --> 01:06:46,370
Aren't there four people?

1888
01:06:46,370 --> 01:06:51,070
- Someone else found the ticket. - Really?

1889
01:06:51,070 --> 01:06:52,770
I can take one person. I'll go with Seong Woo.

1890
01:06:52,770 --> 01:06:54,710
(He picks Seong Woo who's a candidate for Hades.)

1891
01:06:54,710 --> 01:06:56,750
- Seong Woo. I should watch. - Okay. Right.

1892
01:06:57,180 --> 01:06:58,680
- Bae Seong Woo. - Yes?

1893
01:06:58,680 --> 01:07:01,020
Someone who has a photo printing ticket picked you.

1894
01:07:01,020 --> 01:07:02,650
- Really? Okay. - Please go to the photo studio.

1895
01:07:04,250 --> 01:07:06,020
It'll be creepy if it's really him.

1896
01:07:06,020 --> 01:07:07,690
(He picks Seong Woo to go with to the photo studio.)

1897
01:07:08,220 --> 01:07:12,760
- Jae Suk, you have been called. - Really?

1898
01:07:12,760 --> 01:07:15,960
(Jae Suk is chosen to go to the photo studio.)

1899
01:07:16,330 --> 01:07:19,570
(Who picked Jae Suk?)

1900
01:07:19,570 --> 01:07:21,140
- Kwang Soo. - Yes, Jae Suk?

1901
01:07:21,200 --> 01:07:23,170
- Did you call me? - No.

1902
01:07:24,370 --> 01:07:25,570
(Jae Suk arrives without knowing why.)

1903
01:07:25,570 --> 01:07:26,740
Who called me?

1904
01:07:27,280 --> 01:07:28,410
I don't know who.

1905
01:07:28,710 --> 01:07:30,110
- I'll go inside first. - Go ahead.

1906
01:07:30,110 --> 01:07:31,110
(Who picked Jae Suk?)

1907
01:07:31,350 --> 01:07:32,910
This is great.

1908
01:07:32,910 --> 01:07:34,620
(3 people enter the photo studio.)

1909
01:07:34,620 --> 01:07:36,020
- You came. - What?

1910
01:07:36,450 --> 01:07:37,690
- You came. - What?

1911
01:07:37,690 --> 01:07:38,750
I called you.

1912
01:07:38,850 --> 01:07:40,060
Did you call me?

1913
01:07:40,060 --> 01:07:41,820
(The one who called Jae Suk is...)

1914
01:07:42,220 --> 01:07:43,730
I called you, Jae Suk.

1915
01:07:45,660 --> 01:07:49,830
(A moment ago in the ghost room)

1916
01:07:49,830 --> 01:07:52,670
(He obtains a photo printing ticket.)

1917
01:07:52,670 --> 01:07:55,400
People are suspicious of him.

1918
01:07:56,100 --> 01:07:58,270
I'll take Jae Suk with me.

1919
01:07:59,210 --> 01:08:00,810
(He picks Jae Suk, a candidate for Hades.)

1920
01:08:00,810 --> 01:08:03,450
- Okay. - Let me tell you again.

1921
01:08:03,780 --> 01:08:06,820
If one of you is a brother deity, the photo will turn bright.

1922
01:08:06,820 --> 01:08:10,850
If one of you is Hades, the photo will turn dark.

1923
01:08:10,950 --> 01:08:13,420
If Hades and brother deities are among you,

1924
01:08:13,420 --> 01:08:15,360
- you'll have beards in your photo. - Okay.

1925
01:08:15,360 --> 01:08:17,860
- If there's a brother deity? - If there is at least once,

1926
01:08:17,860 --> 01:08:19,930
- you'll have beards in your photo. - Okay.

1927
01:08:20,160 --> 01:08:21,500
Here we go. Smile.

1928
01:08:22,160 --> 01:08:23,400
1, 2, 3.

1929
01:08:23,400 --> 01:08:25,570
(The photo of these 4)

1930
01:08:25,570 --> 01:08:30,340
(How will it turn out?)

1931
01:08:31,570 --> 01:08:32,710
Okay.

1932
01:08:32,710 --> 01:08:34,140
(An important hint will be given in their photo.)

1933
01:08:34,140 --> 01:08:35,840
Please wait for the result.

1934
01:08:35,940 --> 01:08:37,910
- It'll be an important hint. - Definitely.

1935
01:08:37,910 --> 01:08:39,280
- Overall, - Definitely.

1936
01:08:39,280 --> 01:08:41,080
all of us are men.

1937
01:08:41,080 --> 01:08:42,380
- Right. - We're all candidates.

1938
01:08:42,380 --> 01:08:43,920
- All four of us are candidates. - Right.

1939
01:08:44,820 --> 01:08:46,720
- Your photo is printed. - Okay.

1940
01:08:46,720 --> 01:08:48,820
(Your photo is printed.)

1941
01:08:48,920 --> 01:08:50,290
- Please take it. - Okay.

1942
01:08:50,630 --> 01:08:52,360
- Check it. - This is very...

1943
01:08:52,430 --> 01:08:54,100
- crucial hint. - Let's see.

1944
01:08:54,600 --> 01:08:56,430
We just have to flip it.

1945
01:08:56,430 --> 01:08:57,900
This is crucial.

1946
01:08:59,530 --> 01:09:01,800
(Members are surprised by the photo.)

1947
01:09:01,800 --> 01:09:06,010
(What kind of photo is it?)

1948
01:09:10,250 --> 01:09:13,010
(They have beards in the photo.)

1949
01:09:13,280 --> 01:09:16,820
(Beards means Hades and brother deities are among them.)

1950
01:09:18,520 --> 01:09:20,990
Wait, wait a minute.

1951
01:09:21,390 --> 01:09:22,990
(Hades and Zeus are among them.)

1952
01:09:22,990 --> 01:09:24,160
Wait.

1953
01:09:26,290 --> 01:09:28,160
- Is everyone here? - Everyone is here.

1954
01:09:28,160 --> 01:09:29,330
Wait.

1955
01:09:29,530 --> 01:09:31,370
(Zeus and Hades exist among the 4 of them.)

1956
01:09:31,370 --> 01:09:33,670
- Hades and... - There are Hades and Zeus.

1957
01:09:33,670 --> 01:09:35,700
It's either Zeus or Poseidon.

1958
01:09:35,870 --> 01:09:37,010
One of them is a woman.

1959
01:09:37,010 --> 01:09:38,340
(Candidates for Hades and Zeus are narrowed down.)

1960
01:09:38,340 --> 01:09:39,510
We...

1961
01:09:39,610 --> 01:09:41,240
The people who need to be here are here.

1962
01:09:41,340 --> 01:09:43,980
- We shouldn't move. Wait. - The person who's left...

1963
01:09:44,450 --> 01:09:45,610
- Why? - Okay, I have to go.

1964
01:09:45,610 --> 01:09:47,550
- Wait. - Jae Suk, why are you leaving?

1965
01:09:47,550 --> 01:09:49,020
- Okay, I'm leaving. - Wait.

1966
01:09:49,020 --> 01:09:51,090
Jae Suk, why are you leaving?

1967
01:09:51,090 --> 01:09:52,590
- I have to go. - Wait.

1968
01:09:52,590 --> 01:09:53,920
- Wait. - What's wrong?

1969
01:09:53,990 --> 01:09:56,320
- Do you have something to do? - Wait, listen.

1970
01:09:56,320 --> 01:09:58,060
- It's dangerous here. - Wait, listen.

1971
01:09:58,060 --> 01:09:59,090
Isn't everyone here?

1972
01:09:59,090 --> 01:10:00,430
- Let me talk. - It's dangerous.

1973
01:10:00,430 --> 01:10:01,800
- I can't stay here. - Right?

1974
01:10:01,800 --> 01:10:03,100
- I am... - It's not what you think.

1975
01:10:03,100 --> 01:10:04,300
- I'm leaving. - Right here...

1976
01:10:04,400 --> 01:10:05,630
I'm leaving.

1977
01:10:05,630 --> 01:10:07,170
(Jae Suk leaves without analyzing.)

1978
01:10:07,700 --> 01:10:10,210
(What's wrong with him all of a sudden?)

1979
01:10:10,210 --> 01:10:11,940
Where are you going, Jae Suk?

1980
01:10:12,270 --> 01:10:16,480
(Is Jae Suk Hades?)

1981
01:10:16,980 --> 01:10:18,980
Where did he go? We found out everything.

1982
01:10:18,980 --> 01:10:20,980
Where is he going? Everyone is here.

1983
01:10:21,880 --> 01:10:23,650
It's so strange that he left.

1984
01:10:25,420 --> 01:10:27,760
(He acts suspicious.)

1985
01:10:27,760 --> 01:10:28,890
Hey.

1986
01:10:29,260 --> 01:10:30,790
- Hey. - What happened?

1987
01:10:30,790 --> 01:10:32,590
- He's out. - Did the photo come out?

1988
01:10:32,590 --> 01:10:34,200
- Which photo was it? - One of them is Hades.

1989
01:10:34,560 --> 01:10:36,030
- Really? - Who are inside?

1990
01:10:36,060 --> 01:10:37,630
I don't know yet.

1991
01:10:37,630 --> 01:10:39,400
- Who are inside? - Which photo was it?

1992
01:10:39,500 --> 01:10:40,970
- The one with beards. - In that case...

1993
01:10:41,000 --> 01:10:42,900
- there are also deities. - There are also deities.

1994
01:10:42,900 --> 01:10:44,140
- I told you. - Hold on.

1995
01:10:44,810 --> 01:10:45,940
Come here for a minute.

1996
01:10:45,940 --> 01:10:48,740
(He gathers the members carefully.)

1997
01:10:50,150 --> 01:10:51,180
I'm Zeus.

1998
01:10:51,180 --> 01:10:53,350
(I'm Zeus.)

1999
01:10:53,350 --> 01:10:55,480
I'm Zeus.

2000
01:10:55,480 --> 01:10:57,390
- Really? - I'm Zeus.

2001
01:10:58,690 --> 01:11:00,190
- In that case... - Really?

2002
01:11:01,290 --> 01:11:03,390
She thinks Jong Kook is Zeus.

2003
01:11:03,390 --> 01:11:05,190
(Yi Hyun thinks that Jong Kook is Zeus.)

2004
01:11:05,590 --> 01:11:08,130
(Is Jong Kook Zeus?)

2005
01:11:08,130 --> 01:11:09,500
Why?

2006
01:11:09,930 --> 01:11:12,000
He told me himself.

2007
01:11:12,000 --> 01:11:13,500
Someone also told me.

2008
01:11:14,170 --> 01:11:17,270
(Both Jae Suk and Jong Kook claim that they're Zeus.)

2009
01:11:17,270 --> 01:11:19,070
They told me to keep it a secret.

2010
01:11:19,170 --> 01:11:20,380
I'm Zeus.

2011
01:11:20,440 --> 01:11:22,580
Jong Kook is Hades.

2012
01:11:22,580 --> 01:11:24,580
(Jong Kook is Hades.)

2013
01:11:25,380 --> 01:11:26,720
I think Jong Kook is Hades.

2014
01:11:26,720 --> 01:11:28,720
(Is Jong Kook Hades all of a sudden?)

2015
01:11:29,450 --> 01:11:31,020
(As rumors say, is Jong Kook Zeus?)

2016
01:11:31,020 --> 01:11:32,350
- I think Jong Kook is Hades. - What?

2017
01:11:32,350 --> 01:11:34,520
- I have a feeling. - Then...

2018
01:11:35,190 --> 01:11:37,930
- it's confusing again. - I suspected Seong Woo.

2019
01:11:37,930 --> 01:11:39,030
- Me too. - Me too.

2020
01:11:39,030 --> 01:11:41,060
Suddenly, Jong Wook said...

2021
01:11:41,900 --> 01:11:43,500
- Hades found out about the chair? - Be quiet.

2022
01:11:43,500 --> 01:11:44,970
How would he know right now?

2023
01:11:44,970 --> 01:11:46,170
What did it mean?

2024
01:11:46,170 --> 01:11:48,740
They gathered around.

2025
01:11:49,770 --> 01:11:51,440
Wait, be quiet.

2026
01:11:52,140 --> 01:11:53,740
Wait, so he's saying he's Zeus?

2027
01:11:54,380 --> 01:11:55,780
Don't tell them.

2028
01:11:55,780 --> 01:11:57,650
(Who is telling the truth?)

2029
01:11:58,410 --> 01:12:00,480
(Jae Suk moves quickly to the doll room.)

2030
01:12:00,480 --> 01:12:02,250
Hello, aren't you tired?

2031
01:12:02,920 --> 01:12:03,990
Can we do it again?

2032
01:12:03,990 --> 01:12:07,560
(By playing the haunted room game,)

2033
01:12:07,560 --> 01:12:09,160
(he obtains Jong Kook's name tag.)

2034
01:12:09,160 --> 01:12:10,590
I'll take Jong Kook's.

2035
01:12:10,860 --> 01:12:12,360
- Thank you. - Bye.

2036
01:12:12,360 --> 01:12:14,360
Bye. I'm Zeus.

2037
01:12:14,360 --> 01:12:16,330
(Jae Suk claims that he's Zeus. Who is he?)

2038
01:12:16,330 --> 01:12:18,330
So Min, did you go to the photo room?

2039
01:12:18,330 --> 01:12:20,500
No, but I heard that it's the photo with beards.

2040
01:12:20,500 --> 01:12:22,340
(Ji Hyo hears about the hint later.)

2041
01:12:22,340 --> 01:12:23,610
Ji Hyo.

2042
01:12:24,070 --> 01:12:25,210
We took a photo.

2043
01:12:25,810 --> 01:12:28,780
(Jong Kook shares the hint directly with Ji Hyo.)

2044
01:12:28,780 --> 01:12:29,940
It was the one with beards.

2045
01:12:30,080 --> 01:12:31,380
- Who was inside? - Here's the photo.

2046
01:12:31,650 --> 01:12:33,680
- Come here, Ji Hyo. - I told you already.

2047
01:12:33,850 --> 01:12:35,020
Four people.

2048
01:12:35,480 --> 01:12:37,490
It was the photo with beards, and I was one of them.

2049
01:12:37,550 --> 01:12:38,690
It's one of the three.

2050
01:12:38,790 --> 01:12:40,260
- Is it one of the three? - Yes.

2051
01:12:43,120 --> 01:12:44,930
You aren't it, are you?

2052
01:12:44,930 --> 01:12:46,130
- No. - You aren't.

2053
01:12:46,230 --> 01:12:48,530
- You aren't it. - You found out everything about me.

2054
01:12:48,700 --> 01:12:50,030
- I'm not it. - We could tell them.

2055
01:12:50,030 --> 01:12:51,430
- Can't we tell them? - We can.

2056
01:12:51,430 --> 01:12:52,800
We can tell them now.

2057
01:12:53,540 --> 01:12:56,270
(What do they want to tell us?)

2058
01:12:56,270 --> 01:12:58,140
Jae Suk claims that he's Zeus.

2059
01:12:58,140 --> 01:12:59,540
He said that he's Zeus.

2060
01:13:00,140 --> 01:13:01,240
Jae Suk did?

2061
01:13:01,280 --> 01:13:02,440
What were the hints again?

2062
01:13:02,440 --> 01:13:04,580
- Jae Suk said that he's Zeus? - He told me.

2063
01:13:04,580 --> 01:13:05,580
Then it's him.

2064
01:13:06,080 --> 01:13:07,250
- Suk Jin believes him. - Jae Suk?

2065
01:13:07,250 --> 01:13:08,880
Be quiet. Don't tell anyone.

2066
01:13:09,550 --> 01:13:10,750
I'm Poseidon.

2067
01:13:13,420 --> 01:13:14,820
- Are you Zeus? - Yes.

2068
01:13:14,820 --> 01:13:16,830
(If Ji Hyo is Poseidon)

2069
01:13:16,890 --> 01:13:19,160
- We got the mission this morning. - We did.

2070
01:13:19,160 --> 01:13:21,800
(We got the mission this morning.)

2071
01:13:21,800 --> 01:13:24,870
(If they received the mission together...)

2072
01:13:25,930 --> 01:13:29,940
Today's Metamorphosis Race will have deities disguised as humans.

2073
01:13:30,440 --> 01:13:33,340
The two of you are the deities who are disguised as humans.

2074
01:13:34,940 --> 01:13:37,110
Have you heard of Zeus, Poseidon, and Hades from...

2075
01:13:37,110 --> 01:13:39,510
- Greek and Roman mythology? - Yes.

2076
01:13:39,510 --> 01:13:42,750
Kicked out to the underworld, Hades became vengeful.

2077
01:13:42,750 --> 01:13:46,350
To take Zeus and Poseidon to the underworld with him,

2078
01:13:46,590 --> 01:13:48,490
he's is hiding as a human.

2079
01:13:49,190 --> 01:13:53,190
To make Hades return to the underworld,

2080
01:13:53,190 --> 01:13:55,300
Zeus and Poseidon are also disguised as humans.

2081
01:13:55,860 --> 01:13:57,170
Is she Poseidon?

2082
01:13:57,370 --> 01:13:59,730
Am I Zeus, and is he Poseidon?

2083
01:13:59,730 --> 01:14:02,270
Ji Hyo, you're Poseidon, the deity of the sea.

2084
01:14:02,340 --> 01:14:03,440
Okay.

2085
01:14:03,440 --> 01:14:05,770
You're Poseidon. How dare you try to be Zeus?

2086
01:14:05,870 --> 01:14:08,180
- Two of you are deities. - Okay.

2087
01:14:08,710 --> 01:14:12,310
If the brother deities find Hades and eliminate him first,

2088
01:14:12,310 --> 01:14:13,820
Team Deity and Human win.

2089
01:14:13,820 --> 01:14:15,850
If Hades finds Zeus and Poseidon...

2090
01:14:15,850 --> 01:14:17,890
and eliminates the brother deities first,

2091
01:14:17,890 --> 01:14:19,920
- Hades will win. - Okay.

2092
01:14:19,920 --> 01:14:21,090
(Two deities heard the rules in advance.)

2093
01:14:21,090 --> 01:14:22,590
No wonder I thought you two made a good couple today.

2094
01:14:23,260 --> 01:14:25,190
I thought you two made a good couple today.

2095
01:14:25,260 --> 01:14:26,360
Then is it Jae Suk?

2096
01:14:26,360 --> 01:14:29,260
(Is Jae Suk Hades?)

2097
01:14:29,900 --> 01:14:32,030
(Jae Suk has been watching everything.)

2098
01:14:32,030 --> 01:14:33,900
We have to kill Hades now.

2099
01:14:34,340 --> 01:14:36,670
We should get the name tag...

2100
01:14:36,670 --> 01:14:38,670
from Annabelle's room.

2101
01:14:38,870 --> 01:14:41,280
(Jae Suk claimed to be Zeus. Is he Hades?)

2102
01:14:41,280 --> 01:14:43,340
- Let's go and take it. - Okay.

2103
01:14:43,340 --> 01:14:44,680
(Jae Suk claimed to be Zeus. Is he Hades?)

2104
01:14:45,850 --> 01:14:47,180
Goodness.

2105
01:14:47,450 --> 01:14:49,480
I now know who Poseidon is.

2106
01:14:51,390 --> 01:14:56,620
(Ji Hyo heads to the doll room to find Hades' name tag.)

2107
01:15:00,560 --> 01:15:01,730
(At that moment)

2108
01:15:02,430 --> 01:15:05,800
(Jae Suk follows Ji Hyo and enters the room.)

2109
01:15:07,140 --> 01:15:08,540
(Screaming)

2110
01:15:08,540 --> 01:15:10,540
(Tearing)

2111
01:15:11,210 --> 01:15:13,170
Ji Hyo, who is Poseidon,

2112
01:15:13,170 --> 01:15:15,210
was eliminated a moment ago.

2113
01:15:16,310 --> 01:15:19,680
Ji Hyo, who is Poseidon was eliminated a moment ago.

2114
01:15:20,380 --> 01:15:21,520
Who is it?

2115
01:15:21,520 --> 01:15:23,890
- Ji Hyo just left a moment ago. - What?

2116
01:15:24,090 --> 01:15:26,990
- Jae Suk. - We can't tell you when it was.

2117
01:15:27,490 --> 01:15:28,860
Did Jae Suk...

2118
01:15:29,620 --> 01:15:33,160
(Was it Jae Suk who eliminated Ji Hyo?)

2119
01:15:33,160 --> 01:15:36,030
(Is Jae Suk Hades?)

2120
01:15:36,030 --> 01:15:37,870
Did you find the name tag?

2121
01:15:37,870 --> 01:15:39,000
You mean Jae Suk's?

2122
01:15:39,300 --> 01:15:40,700
- Who? - Jae Suk's.

2123
01:15:41,570 --> 01:15:43,810
(Jae Suk's name tag)

2124
01:15:44,540 --> 01:15:46,210
- Did you find the wooden chair? - Wooden chair?

2125
01:15:46,210 --> 01:15:47,640
- What? - Did you find the wooden chair?

2126
01:15:47,640 --> 01:15:48,910
- No. - We have to find it.

2127
01:15:49,380 --> 01:15:50,710
We have to find the chair.

2128
01:15:50,710 --> 01:15:52,080
- Right. - The chair.

2129
01:15:52,150 --> 01:15:54,380
(To eliminate Hades, they must find his wooden chair.)

2130
01:15:54,380 --> 01:15:55,450
Hades?

2131
01:15:55,520 --> 01:15:56,880
Does it say it's Hades' chair?

2132
01:15:56,880 --> 01:15:58,190
(There are many chairs in the building.)

2133
01:15:58,190 --> 01:15:59,320
No way.

2134
01:15:59,320 --> 01:16:00,960
(There are many chairs in the building.)

2135
01:16:00,960 --> 01:16:03,760
How can we find it when there are so many chairs?

2136
01:16:03,760 --> 01:16:05,190
(Which one is Hades' wooden chair?)

2137
01:16:05,190 --> 01:16:06,490
Goodness.

2138
01:16:08,800 --> 01:16:11,900
(At that time,)

2139
01:16:11,900 --> 01:16:14,140
(Kwang Soo spots a suspicious-looking chair.)

2140
01:16:21,680 --> 01:16:25,480
(Burn Hades' chair with the name tag of a deity to eliminate that deity.)

2141
01:16:26,480 --> 01:16:27,920
(There's a label on the chair.)

2142
01:16:27,920 --> 01:16:29,080
Is this a wooden chair?

2143
01:16:29,220 --> 01:16:30,280
Is this it?

2144
01:16:30,820 --> 01:16:34,660
(It's Hades' wooden chair.)

2145
01:16:34,660 --> 01:16:35,690
(All he has to do is find Hades' name tag.)

2146
01:16:35,690 --> 01:16:36,820
Is this the chair?

2147
01:16:37,290 --> 01:16:38,860
This one has to be it.

2148
01:16:38,860 --> 01:16:40,830
- Jong Kook, isn't this it? - What?

2149
01:16:41,100 --> 01:16:42,160
This one has to it.

2150
01:16:42,160 --> 01:16:43,870
It's also the right size.

2151
01:16:43,870 --> 01:16:45,030
That's not it.

2152
01:16:45,270 --> 01:16:47,400
- That's not it. - I don't think that's it.

2153
01:16:47,400 --> 01:16:48,470
Isn't this it?

2154
01:16:48,670 --> 01:16:49,770
What are you going to do?

2155
01:16:49,770 --> 01:16:53,040
(Jae Suk appears.)

2156
01:16:53,040 --> 01:16:54,110
This is the chair.

2157
01:16:54,110 --> 01:16:55,680
(This is Hades' wooden chair.)

2158
01:16:57,150 --> 01:16:59,850
(Jae Suk approaches Hades' wooden chair.)

2159
01:16:59,850 --> 01:17:01,050
Who is Hades?

2160
01:17:02,780 --> 01:17:05,190
- I don't think that's it. - I think this is it.

2161
01:17:06,050 --> 01:17:07,390
Who is Hades?

2162
01:17:08,160 --> 01:17:10,320
Who do you think it is? Isn't it Jong Kook?

2163
01:17:10,320 --> 01:17:11,860
(Isn't it Jong Kook?)

2164
01:17:11,860 --> 01:17:12,930
(Is Jong Kook Hades?)

2165
01:17:12,930 --> 01:17:14,430
I think so.

2166
01:17:14,430 --> 01:17:15,630
(Is Jong Kook Hades?)

2167
01:17:15,630 --> 01:17:17,800
I thought about it carefully.

2168
01:17:17,800 --> 01:17:18,870
(Moments ago, Jae Suk left the photo studio quickly.)

2169
01:17:18,870 --> 01:17:20,500
I thought it was Seong Woo.

2170
01:17:20,500 --> 01:17:21,600
(They're narrowing down candidates for Hades.)

2171
01:17:21,600 --> 01:17:22,770
Wait.

2172
01:17:23,440 --> 01:17:25,370
Seong Woo doesn't know anything.

2173
01:17:26,440 --> 01:17:27,680
Wait.

2174
01:17:27,680 --> 01:17:30,380
(Kwang Soo hears Jae Suk by chance.)

2175
01:17:31,110 --> 01:17:32,680
(Jae Suk was narrowing down candidates for Hades.)

2176
01:17:32,680 --> 01:17:35,920
Hey, you aren't it, are you?

2177
01:17:36,020 --> 01:17:37,450
You aren't Hades.

2178
01:17:37,890 --> 01:17:39,050
Of course not.

2179
01:17:39,590 --> 01:17:41,920
Since you're saying that, you aren't Hades.

2180
01:17:41,920 --> 01:17:43,190
Of course not.

2181
01:17:44,930 --> 01:17:46,330
Come here, Kwang Soo.

2182
01:17:47,330 --> 01:17:48,700
Come here, Kwang Soo.

2183
01:17:49,200 --> 01:17:50,360
Hurry, Kwang Soo.

2184
01:17:50,360 --> 01:17:51,730
Kwang Soo.

2185
01:17:52,730 --> 01:17:54,100
Kwang Soo.

2186
01:17:54,200 --> 01:17:55,540
Kwang Soo.

2187
01:17:55,540 --> 01:17:56,670
Hurry.

2188
01:17:56,670 --> 01:17:57,870
(It's not clear who Hades is.)

2189
01:17:57,870 --> 01:17:59,410
- Hurry, Kwang Soo. - Kwang Soo.

2190
01:17:59,540 --> 01:18:00,780
Kwang Soo.

2191
01:18:01,710 --> 01:18:02,840
Kwang Soo.

2192
01:18:02,840 --> 01:18:04,410
We need to stop him now.

2193
01:18:04,410 --> 01:18:05,950
- Let's take this. - Seriously. Come here.

2194
01:18:06,110 --> 01:18:07,850
I'm telling the truth. Come now.

2195
01:18:07,850 --> 01:18:09,680
See? He's burning it.

2196
01:18:09,980 --> 01:18:11,520
Come here now.

2197
01:18:11,520 --> 01:18:14,020
- Is it him? - Come here now.

2198
01:18:14,520 --> 01:18:15,690
Is it him?

2199
01:18:16,390 --> 01:18:17,490
Kwang Soo!

2200
01:18:17,490 --> 01:18:18,790
(Jong Kook tries to stop Kwang Soo.)

2201
01:18:18,790 --> 01:18:19,990
Seriously.

2202
01:18:19,990 --> 01:18:21,830
No.

2203
01:18:21,830 --> 01:18:23,400
Put it in here right now.

2204
01:18:23,400 --> 01:18:24,430
(Who is the real Hades?)

2205
01:18:25,130 --> 01:18:27,370
(It goes into the fire.)

2206
01:18:27,370 --> 01:18:29,240
Did you put a name tag on? Did you put mine?

2207
01:18:29,240 --> 01:18:31,170
- Jae Suk put it on. - Did you put the name on?

2208
01:18:31,540 --> 01:18:33,370
Jong Kook.

2209
01:18:33,710 --> 01:18:35,240
- I don't think it's him. - Isn't it him?

2210
01:18:35,240 --> 01:18:36,980
- It isn't him. - Is that the right chair?

2211
01:18:36,980 --> 01:18:38,280
- That's not the right chair. - It is.

2212
01:18:38,280 --> 01:18:40,580
That chair is Hades' chair.

2213
01:18:40,580 --> 01:18:41,680
Is that right?

2214
01:18:41,850 --> 01:18:43,450
- That's the right chair? - Is this the chair?

2215
01:18:43,450 --> 01:18:45,050
(It is Hades' wooden chair.)

2216
01:18:45,050 --> 01:18:46,190
Goodness.

2217
01:18:46,190 --> 01:18:47,360
Jong Kook is...

2218
01:18:47,360 --> 01:18:50,490
(The race result changes depending on who Jong Kook is.)

2219
01:18:50,590 --> 01:18:52,890
(Who is Jong Kook?)

2220
01:18:52,890 --> 01:18:54,300
Jong Kook is...

2221
01:18:54,300 --> 01:18:55,700
(He is...)

2222
01:18:55,700 --> 01:18:56,900
Hades.

2223
01:18:58,600 --> 01:19:01,600
(Unbelievable)

2224
01:19:01,600 --> 01:19:04,370
(The real Hades is Jong Kook.)

2225
01:19:04,370 --> 01:19:05,510
You brat.

2226
01:19:05,510 --> 01:19:06,910
- Why you... - Goodness.

2227
01:19:07,710 --> 01:19:10,210
Jong Kook, you're one of the three deities.

2228
01:19:10,210 --> 01:19:11,880
You're Hades, the deity of the underworld.

2229
01:19:12,780 --> 01:19:14,850
(It suits him somehow.)

2230
01:19:14,850 --> 01:19:16,120
The deity of the underworld suits me.

2231
01:19:16,880 --> 01:19:19,190
When the guests arrive,

2232
01:19:19,190 --> 01:19:21,520
it'll be an unfair fight of 1 against 11.

2233
01:19:21,520 --> 01:19:22,620
Right.

2234
01:19:22,620 --> 01:19:25,660
That's why we'll give you an advantage.

2235
01:19:26,690 --> 01:19:28,930
One of the brother deities who is after Hades is...

2236
01:19:29,100 --> 01:19:31,370
Poseidon, and it's Ji Hyo.

2237
01:19:31,370 --> 01:19:33,600
(He's given who Poseidon is.)

2238
01:19:33,940 --> 01:19:35,240
We will share this with you.

2239
01:19:35,240 --> 01:19:36,500
It's Ji Hyo.

2240
01:19:36,570 --> 01:19:38,270
Since you're Hades,

2241
01:19:38,270 --> 01:19:41,310
you cannot lie to anyone that you're Zeus.

2242
01:19:43,040 --> 01:19:44,110
(He's not allowed to lie about being Zeus.)

2243
01:19:44,110 --> 01:19:46,180
I understand. Leave it up to me.

2244
01:19:46,180 --> 01:19:47,720
- Please do well. - Okay.

2245
01:19:47,720 --> 01:19:50,350
You know why we called you separately, right?

2246
01:19:50,350 --> 01:19:52,190
Yes, can you not make us do things like this?

2247
01:19:52,190 --> 01:19:53,690
Please I beg you.

2248
01:19:53,690 --> 01:19:56,020
- To do it with her... - It makes me uncomfortable.

2249
01:19:56,020 --> 01:19:58,660
Two of you are deities disguised as humans.

2250
01:19:58,660 --> 01:19:59,690
- What? - Okay.

2251
01:20:00,800 --> 01:20:02,260
Is she Poseidon?

2252
01:20:02,260 --> 01:20:04,630
- Am I Zeus, and is he Poseidon? - Is Ji Hyo Poseidon?

2253
01:20:04,630 --> 01:20:07,100
Ji Hyo, you're Poseidon, the deity of the sea.

2254
01:20:07,340 --> 01:20:09,400
Okay, you're Poseidon.

2255
01:20:09,400 --> 01:20:10,770
How dare you try to be Zeus?

2256
01:20:10,770 --> 01:20:13,210
- Two of you are deities. - Okay.

2257
01:20:14,380 --> 01:20:17,210
(Jong Kook finishes the shoot after fooling Ji Hyo completely.)

2258
01:20:17,210 --> 01:20:19,580
- We got the mission this morning. - We did.

2259
01:20:19,580 --> 01:20:22,520
(Jong Kook's acting fooled everyone.)

2260
01:20:23,350 --> 01:20:25,850
(Haha was the first to figure out how to eliminate deities.)

2261
01:20:26,250 --> 01:20:27,490
(Tearing)

2262
01:20:28,320 --> 01:20:29,960
(Haha is eliminated.)

2263
01:20:29,960 --> 01:20:31,230
You're Hades.

2264
01:20:32,830 --> 01:20:34,130
(Tearing)

2265
01:20:35,230 --> 01:20:36,500
(Dong Il is also eliminated.)

2266
01:20:36,500 --> 01:20:37,670
I'm sorry.

2267
01:20:37,670 --> 01:20:39,200
(He was a candidate for Zeus.)

2268
01:20:39,200 --> 01:20:40,530
Let's see. Come here.

2269
01:20:41,370 --> 01:20:42,800
Come here.

2270
01:20:42,800 --> 01:20:45,670
"Zeus was born on an even number day."

2271
01:20:45,670 --> 01:20:49,610
(Zeus was born on an even number day.)

2272
01:20:49,610 --> 01:20:50,810
(Jong Kook isn't included.)

2273
01:20:50,810 --> 01:20:52,050
- What? - Wait.

2274
01:20:52,210 --> 01:20:53,810
Is it a hint for Zeus?

2275
01:20:53,810 --> 01:20:55,350
(Tearing)

2276
01:20:55,350 --> 01:20:56,780
Is it a hint for Zeus?

2277
01:20:56,780 --> 01:20:59,450
(Jong Kook eliminates Ji Hyo.)

2278
01:20:59,650 --> 01:21:00,720
What?

2279
01:21:00,720 --> 01:21:02,360
(What's this?)

2280
01:21:02,360 --> 01:21:03,520
(Completely fooled Ji Hyo is eliminated.)

2281
01:21:03,520 --> 01:21:05,830
It has to be Jae Suk after seeing this.

2282
01:21:08,000 --> 01:21:11,200
The winners of the summer special Metamorphosis Race...

2283
01:21:11,200 --> 01:21:12,670
are Team Brother Deities and Team Human.

2284
01:21:12,670 --> 01:21:14,640
(Team Brother Deities and Team Human are final winners.)

2285
01:21:14,640 --> 01:21:16,040
It could be have been dangerous.

2286
01:21:16,040 --> 01:21:17,440
- I'm glad that we won. - By the way...

2287
01:21:17,440 --> 01:21:18,510
Zeus.

2288
01:21:18,510 --> 01:21:20,110
(She's ashamed.)

2289
01:21:20,110 --> 01:21:21,440
- We won. - Poseidon.

2290
01:21:21,440 --> 01:21:22,940
- Zeus. - Poseidon.

2291
01:21:22,940 --> 01:21:24,980
You worked so closely with Jong Kook.

2292
01:21:24,980 --> 01:21:26,810
She thought that I was Zeus.

2293
01:21:26,810 --> 01:21:29,050
- It couldn't be helped. - The two of them stayed together.

2294
01:21:29,050 --> 01:21:30,250
I know.

2295
01:21:30,250 --> 01:21:33,390
To Team Brother Deities and Team Human who won the race,

2296
01:21:33,390 --> 01:21:36,720
we'll give high-quality nutritional supplements to fight the summer.

2297
01:21:36,720 --> 01:21:39,560
Nutritional supplements? I like them.

2298
01:21:40,530 --> 01:21:42,200
It's Vitamin C.

2299
01:21:42,200 --> 01:21:43,530
(Thank you.)

2300
01:21:43,530 --> 01:21:46,900
Please tell us what you thought.

2301
01:21:47,440 --> 01:21:49,640
It was very thrilling.

2302
01:21:49,640 --> 01:21:51,170
It was a good game.

2303
01:21:51,740 --> 01:21:53,170
You don't know the rules.

2304
01:21:53,170 --> 01:21:54,810
I saw many ghosts.

2305
01:21:55,480 --> 01:21:57,010
I'll keep it as a good memory.

2306
01:21:57,310 --> 01:21:59,610
Thank you for the nutritional supplements.

2307
01:21:59,880 --> 01:22:01,820
- Thank you. - Thank you.

2308
01:22:01,820 --> 01:22:04,490
(We thank our guests and all the ghosts.)

2309
01:22:04,850 --> 01:22:06,890
(Members are desperately looking for one person.)

2310
01:22:06,890 --> 01:22:08,160
(Father)

2311
01:22:08,160 --> 01:22:10,160
(Emergency money of 6,000 dollars disappeared.)

2312
01:22:10,160 --> 01:22:11,990
(Father took the family's emergency money.)

2313
01:22:12,860 --> 01:22:15,660
(The children are angry at their father who is in hiding.)

2314
01:22:15,660 --> 01:22:17,030
Okay, I don't know.

2315
01:22:17,030 --> 01:22:18,030
(It's war.)

2316
01:22:18,030 --> 01:22:20,800
(Disappeared Emergency Money Race starts.)

2317
01:22:21,000 --> 01:22:22,600
(Members on the suspect list)

2318
01:22:22,600 --> 01:22:24,210
(A mystery that awaits the members)

2319
01:22:24,440 --> 01:22:25,910
What kind of riddle is this?

2320
01:22:25,910 --> 01:22:29,140
(Deciphering the mystery is not easy.)

2321
01:22:29,410 --> 01:22:32,250
(Who is the father in hiding?)

2322
01:22:32,250 --> 01:22:34,050
(Find the Father)
