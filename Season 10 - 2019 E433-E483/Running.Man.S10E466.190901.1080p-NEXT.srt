1
00:00:05,790 --> 00:00:07,465
- Hi. - Hello.

2
00:00:07,509 --> 00:00:09,010
- Hello. - Hello.

3
00:00:09,010 --> 00:00:11,010
Hello. Hi, hi.

4
00:00:11,010 --> 00:00:13,180
- Hello. - Hi.

5
00:00:13,180 --> 00:00:14,284
Hello.

6
00:00:14,709 --> 00:00:16,980
- What are you doing? - Hello.

7
00:00:16,980 --> 00:00:18,619
(Jae Seok approaches Kwang Soo who's saying hello.)

8
00:00:18,619 --> 00:00:20,289
(He arrests Kwang Soo all of a sudden.)

9
00:00:20,289 --> 00:00:21,389
- It's you, isn't it? - What?

10
00:00:21,389 --> 00:00:23,360
- You're the spy. - Do we have a spy today?

11
00:00:23,389 --> 00:00:24,990
Jae Seok, they didn't give us a mission yet.

12
00:00:24,990 --> 00:00:26,659
- Not yet? - Not yet.

13
00:00:26,659 --> 00:00:29,299
They usually give out the missions to the spies at this cafe.

14
00:00:29,299 --> 00:00:30,459
- You're right. - You know?

15
00:00:30,459 --> 00:00:31,630
That's the cafe.

16
00:00:31,630 --> 00:00:34,770
Hold on, Jae Seok. Why did you come out of the cafe alone?

17
00:00:34,770 --> 00:00:36,569
(Why did you come out of the cafe alone?)

18
00:00:36,569 --> 00:00:37,644
I used the restroom in there.

19
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:39,410
- Hold him. - Hold him.

20
00:00:39,410 --> 00:00:40,709
(I got you, spy!)

21
00:00:40,709 --> 00:00:42,009
(The table has turned.)

22
00:00:42,009 --> 00:00:43,740
Why did you come out of the cafe alone?

23
00:00:43,740 --> 00:00:46,410
Hey. Hey.

24
00:00:46,410 --> 00:00:48,579
Hey, you. Your punches are pretty strong.

25
00:00:48,579 --> 00:00:49,980
- Right. - You know?

26
00:00:49,980 --> 00:00:52,824
- My punches are strong. - They have quite the kick.

27
00:00:54,319 --> 00:00:55,525
Hey, Haha.

28
00:00:56,120 --> 00:00:59,034
(Haha is the fourth one to arrive.)

29
00:00:59,389 --> 00:01:00,829
- Happy birthday - Happy birthday

30
00:01:00,829 --> 00:01:02,600
- I got goosebumps. - Happy birthday

31
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:03,660
(Happy birthday, Haha!)

32
00:01:03,660 --> 00:01:06,170
(The day of the shooting, August 20, was Haha's birthday.)

33
00:01:06,170 --> 00:01:07,270
(Happy birthday, Haha!)

34
00:01:07,270 --> 00:01:10,640
(Congratulations on turning 40.)

35
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:11,640
Come to the center.

36
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:13,740
(The atmosphere is heating up as they wish him happy birthday.)

37
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:14,985
Stand in the center.

38
00:01:15,110 --> 00:01:16,185
Thank you.

39
00:01:16,539 --> 00:01:17,855
Happy birthday.

40
00:01:18,580 --> 00:01:21,149
- Happy birthday. - Where did you come from?

41
00:01:21,149 --> 00:01:22,520
- Happy birthday. - Everyone came all of a sudden.

42
00:01:22,520 --> 00:01:23,754
Hey, Ji Hyo.

43
00:01:23,780 --> 00:01:26,364
Do you want only your left shoulder to hurt?

44
00:01:26,750 --> 00:01:28,765
- Do you want your shoulder to hurt? - It's already red.

45
00:01:28,819 --> 00:01:30,720
- It's already red. - I should put on sunscreen here.

46
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:31,860
Did you apply sunscreen there?

47
00:01:31,860 --> 00:01:32,860
- Hey. - I'm going to.

48
00:01:32,860 --> 00:01:34,229
It's been so long since I saw a BCG vaccine mark.

49
00:01:34,229 --> 00:01:35,364
Hey.

50
00:01:35,860 --> 00:01:38,059
(It's nice to see you again.)

51
00:01:38,059 --> 00:01:39,504
- I didn't mean anything bad. - Stop it.

52
00:01:39,530 --> 00:01:41,575
- My mother has it too. - Kids don't get that anymore.

53
00:01:41,699 --> 00:01:44,169
Depending on the BCG vaccine mark, we can figure out...

54
00:01:44,169 --> 00:01:45,644
- when you were born. - Right.

55
00:01:45,740 --> 00:01:46,944
That's true.

56
00:01:47,470 --> 00:01:48,715
It's like having a barcode.

57
00:01:49,339 --> 00:01:51,610
People who were born in 1981 would have this.

58
00:01:51,610 --> 00:01:53,209
(This mark proves that you are in your 40s.)

59
00:01:53,209 --> 00:01:54,750
- That's so bright. - It's so bright.

60
00:01:54,750 --> 00:01:56,350
- It's bright. - Look at Jong Kook's outfit.

61
00:01:56,419 --> 00:01:58,554
- You dressed up today. - He did.

62
00:01:58,919 --> 00:02:01,250
- This isn't dressing up. - You're dressing up these days.

63
00:02:01,319 --> 00:02:03,194
- This? - You're wearing that?

64
00:02:03,220 --> 00:02:04,360
- Hey. - Hey.

65
00:02:04,360 --> 00:02:05,690
You've changed a bit now.

66
00:02:05,690 --> 00:02:06,729
- Me? - Your outfit, I mean.

67
00:02:06,789 --> 00:02:08,864
- Hey, this is... - He matched the colors even.

68
00:02:09,399 --> 00:02:12,330
This just means that my stylist has been working.

69
00:02:12,330 --> 00:02:14,274
- Hey, you. - She matched the colors.

70
00:02:14,829 --> 00:02:16,874
Jong Kook won't be in a car accident at least.

71
00:02:17,199 --> 00:02:18,470
He won't be in a car accident.

72
00:02:18,539 --> 00:02:20,415
- He's safe. - Right.

73
00:02:21,710 --> 00:02:22,810
You punk.

74
00:02:22,810 --> 00:02:24,979
(Some outfits of the members became the talk of the town.)

75
00:02:24,979 --> 00:02:27,949
We'll evaluate our airport outfits for the Jakarta fan-meet?

76
00:02:27,949 --> 00:02:29,220
Hey, our outfits don't grab attention.

77
00:02:29,220 --> 00:02:30,755
No, we have a star among us.

78
00:02:30,780 --> 00:02:31,880
By the way,

79
00:02:31,880 --> 00:02:34,289
- Jong Kook has a nickname. - What is it?

80
00:02:34,350 --> 00:02:35,564
Kim Nipple.

81
00:02:36,690 --> 00:02:37,919
- That wasn't my intention. - Why do you...

82
00:02:37,919 --> 00:02:39,389
- Why are you showing that photo? - Seriously.

83
00:02:39,389 --> 00:02:41,190
- No one looks at that. - Nipple Kook.

84
00:02:41,190 --> 00:02:42,389
(Nipple Kook is the nickname.)

85
00:02:42,389 --> 00:02:44,005
By the way, Seok Jin's outfit...

86
00:02:44,799 --> 00:02:46,505
His outfit...

87
00:02:46,799 --> 00:02:48,799
- Give him a round of applause. - Seriously.

88
00:02:48,870 --> 00:02:50,344
- I agree. - That took a lot of courage.

89
00:02:50,370 --> 00:02:51,470
Can we even count it as an outfit?

90
00:02:51,470 --> 00:02:52,470
(His front-yard outfit requires a lot of courage.)

91
00:02:52,470 --> 00:02:54,285
Let me say one thing about his outfit.

92
00:02:54,509 --> 00:02:57,440
- The worst outfit at the airport. - That's true.

93
00:02:57,440 --> 00:02:59,880
(One-liner evaluation)

94
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:00,949
- That's true. - That's so true.

95
00:03:00,949 --> 00:03:02,380
- I can guarantee it. - I agree.

96
00:03:02,380 --> 00:03:03,925
Listen. It includes the outfits from Incheon Airport too.

97
00:03:03,949 --> 00:03:05,825
Counting all the outfits at the airport,

98
00:03:05,850 --> 00:03:07,120
his outfit was the worst.

99
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:08,389
Even the fans in Jakarta...

100
00:03:08,389 --> 00:03:10,434
- were disappointed at your pants. - Right.

101
00:03:10,989 --> 00:03:12,120
Why? They were neat.

102
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:14,304
I wore them because it was approved.

103
00:03:14,759 --> 00:03:16,100
(Another fan-meet is just around the corner now.)

104
00:03:16,100 --> 00:03:17,274
Everyone.

105
00:03:17,359 --> 00:03:19,874
- The fan-meet is only a week away. - Yes.

106
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:21,630
We've prepared Running T-Shirts...

107
00:03:21,630 --> 00:03:23,874
which we'll give out at the fan-meet as presents.

108
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,015
- I can't wait. - Let's take a look.

109
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:28,739
- I designed the shirt. - Jae Seok designed it.

110
00:03:28,739 --> 00:03:29,739
It's pretty.

111
00:03:29,739 --> 00:03:31,554
This looks nice.

112
00:03:32,109 --> 00:03:33,579
I don't see my face.

113
00:03:33,579 --> 00:03:34,680
- It's nice. - I can't see my face.

114
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:36,180
(Her face disappears into the background.)

115
00:03:36,180 --> 00:03:38,479
- It has to show. - Hey, Haha is right here.

116
00:03:38,479 --> 00:03:40,289
- He really does look like Ant-Man. - Where?

117
00:03:40,289 --> 00:03:41,620
- He's right here. - Where is he?

118
00:03:41,620 --> 00:03:43,235
- That's so small. - Is that really Haha?

119
00:03:43,819 --> 00:03:45,834
- You guys are too mean. - Kwang Soo is on the blade.

120
00:03:45,859 --> 00:03:47,489
- Hey. - Hey.

121
00:03:47,489 --> 00:03:48,729
But people can still see it.

122
00:03:48,729 --> 00:03:49,834
(He's given up.)

123
00:03:49,930 --> 00:03:51,160
Hey, this looks great.

124
00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:52,804
- That's us. - That's where the bottom goes.

125
00:03:52,870 --> 00:03:55,400
- What's that? - That's where the bottom goes.

126
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:56,569
Our mouth has to show at least.

127
00:03:56,569 --> 00:03:57,814
- That was the penalty. - That's where the bottom goes.

128
00:03:57,840 --> 00:03:59,470
- Se Chan looks handsome there. - This is nice.

129
00:03:59,470 --> 00:04:01,039
- People won't know it's you. - This is great.

130
00:04:01,039 --> 00:04:02,509
Goodness, unbelievable.

131
00:04:02,509 --> 00:04:03,979
This is too mean. You can't see my mouth.

132
00:04:03,979 --> 00:04:05,180
Kids will love it.

133
00:04:05,180 --> 00:04:06,549
- It's nice. It's great. - Kids will.

134
00:04:06,549 --> 00:04:08,985
- We have one more T-shirt. - What is it?

135
00:04:09,380 --> 00:04:12,124
I get the feeling it will be cool. I get that feeling for some reason.

136
00:04:12,590 --> 00:04:13,789
- What's that? - What's that?

137
00:04:13,789 --> 00:04:15,594
- It's cool. - That looks cool.

138
00:04:15,989 --> 00:04:17,094
- What's that? - What is that?

139
00:04:21,830 --> 00:04:23,200
- You look cool. - Hey, you.

140
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:24,374
- Why are we doing this here? - Hey.

141
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:26,304
- Why are we showing that here? - What is it?

142
00:04:26,499 --> 00:04:27,830
- "Haha"? - I see.

143
00:04:27,830 --> 00:04:29,475
- This will help. - Why are we suddenly doing this?

144
00:04:29,499 --> 00:04:30,600
Seriously. Where did you get this?

145
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:31,939
- All the employees... - Darn it.

146
00:04:31,939 --> 00:04:33,910
- from Quan Entertainment... - Listen.

147
00:04:33,910 --> 00:04:36,239
sent us an email and made this very special request.

148
00:04:36,239 --> 00:04:38,080
It's because...

149
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:39,749
Z-Kiri wasn't the first group Haha was in.

150
00:04:39,749 --> 00:04:40,749
- Listen. - How did you get this?

151
00:04:40,749 --> 00:04:43,049
- Why did you hide that from me? - Let me explain.

152
00:04:43,049 --> 00:04:44,720
- I'm so heartbroken. - He debuted as a solo artist.

153
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:45,989
- I'm so sad. - He was a solo artist.

154
00:04:45,989 --> 00:04:47,150
So this is Haha?

155
00:04:47,150 --> 00:04:48,320
- This is driving me crazy. - Let me explain.

156
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:49,994
Seriously. I can't believe this.

157
00:04:50,020 --> 00:04:52,064
"Haha's music stirs up a corner of people's heart,"

158
00:04:52,189 --> 00:04:53,689
"shakes up people's soul,"

159
00:04:53,689 --> 00:04:55,105
"and makes people tremble."

160
00:04:55,260 --> 00:04:57,499
- What is this? - What is this, Haha?

161
00:04:57,499 --> 00:04:59,374
- Did you write that? - Did you write it?

162
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:00,570
- Did you write that yourself? - Let me keep it.

163
00:05:00,570 --> 00:05:01,799
- How old were you then? - I want to keep it.

164
00:05:01,799 --> 00:05:04,200
- I was overly emotional. - Well done.

165
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:07,539
"I want to return to the pure root of hip-hop music."

166
00:05:07,539 --> 00:05:08,884
(The ultimate cringing line)

167
00:05:09,010 --> 00:05:11,080
(I want to return to the pure root of hip-hop music.)

168
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:12,710
(Screaming)

169
00:05:12,710 --> 00:05:14,049
What are you talking about?

170
00:05:14,049 --> 00:05:15,324
This is making me cringe!

171
00:05:15,780 --> 00:05:17,025
- That was too much. - My gosh.

172
00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:18,254
This is so embarrassing.

173
00:05:18,379 --> 00:05:19,720
- What was that? - This is so interesting.

174
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:21,020
- You're worse than me. - It's so embarrassing.

175
00:05:21,020 --> 00:05:22,124
(And she's the Crazy Poet.)

176
00:05:22,150 --> 00:05:23,720
- You'd better edit this out. - That was something else.

177
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:25,189
- All right. We'll listen to... - Darn it.

178
00:05:25,189 --> 00:05:26,789
- the title track, "The Gang". - Hey!

179
00:05:26,789 --> 00:05:28,235
- Hey! - Play the music.

180
00:05:28,660 --> 00:05:29,830
(When his debut song is about to play,)

181
00:05:29,830 --> 00:05:31,100
(he explodes.)

182
00:05:31,100 --> 00:05:32,330
We can listen to it?

183
00:05:32,330 --> 00:05:34,175
Hey, don't play it. I'm serious. I'm sorry.

184
00:05:34,629 --> 00:05:35,845
Darn it!

185
00:05:36,239 --> 00:05:37,744
- Hey. I'm sorry. - Is that your voice?

186
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:39,809
Darn it! Where are you?

187
00:05:39,809 --> 00:05:41,210
(The music starts.)

188
00:05:41,210 --> 00:05:42,645
Darn it! Where are you?

189
00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:43,979
Hey, where is he?

190
00:05:44,039 --> 00:05:45,280
Where's the audio engineer?

191
00:05:45,340 --> 00:05:46,580
(These precious lyrics show the sentiment of a teenager.)

192
00:05:46,580 --> 00:05:47,950
(Haha wrote this when he was in his teens.)

193
00:05:47,950 --> 00:05:49,795
- Where's the audio engineer? - There are lyrics.

194
00:05:50,280 --> 00:05:51,454
This is nice.

195
00:05:51,619 --> 00:05:52,864
Hey, what should I do?

196
00:05:52,919 --> 00:05:54,225
Hey! Where is he?

197
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:55,619
Where's the audio engineer?

198
00:05:55,619 --> 00:05:57,494
Hey! Darn it. Hey.

199
00:05:57,590 --> 00:05:58,665
Don't laugh.

200
00:05:58,820 --> 00:06:00,165
Cover your ears. Cover them.

201
00:06:00,390 --> 00:06:01,665
It's like playing "Of Course".

202
00:06:01,960 --> 00:06:03,100
(Exploding with rage)

203
00:06:03,100 --> 00:06:05,275
- Stop playing it. Stop it! - What kind of music is this?

204
00:06:05,330 --> 00:06:07,004
(The lyrics for "The Gang")

205
00:06:07,499 --> 00:06:08,605
Stop!

206
00:06:08,729 --> 00:06:09,939
Please!

207
00:06:09,939 --> 00:06:10,939
(Dashing away)

208
00:06:10,939 --> 00:06:12,244
- Stop playing. - I got goosebumps.

209
00:06:12,739 --> 00:06:15,669
Seriously. Turn it off! I'm begging you!

210
00:06:15,669 --> 00:06:17,054
"Hip-hop music is all about rap."

211
00:06:17,379 --> 00:06:18,884
(This is from 19-year-old Haha.)

212
00:06:18,979 --> 00:06:20,679
"I will bravely put myself out..."

213
00:06:20,679 --> 00:06:21,979
- "in the world." - Yes.

214
00:06:21,979 --> 00:06:24,295
"I can't make or do music without my love for hip-hop."

215
00:06:24,479 --> 00:06:27,249
"The rhythm of hip-hop is coming to me."

216
00:06:27,249 --> 00:06:29,295
(They get the goosebumps.)

217
00:06:29,489 --> 00:06:30,890
The rhythm is coming to him.

218
00:06:30,890 --> 00:06:32,090
- He was such a snob. - What was he talking about?

219
00:06:32,090 --> 00:06:33,605
"The rhythm is coming to me. Yes."

220
00:06:33,660 --> 00:06:35,634
Did it come to you? So did you get to see it?

221
00:06:35,689 --> 00:06:37,229
- I didn't get to see it. - Really?

222
00:06:37,229 --> 00:06:38,874
You switched to reggae because you couldn't see it?

223
00:06:39,369 --> 00:06:41,444
I didn't know that's how Haha felt about music.

224
00:06:41,570 --> 00:06:42,704
All right.

225
00:06:43,340 --> 00:06:45,314
How am I supposed to film the show in this mood?

226
00:06:46,340 --> 00:06:47,814
Just keep your mouth shut and go home today.

227
00:06:48,470 --> 00:06:51,415
Even your shirt says, "Unfortunately" in English.

228
00:06:51,780 --> 00:06:53,109
- You're right. - Yes.

229
00:06:53,179 --> 00:06:54,324
- Really? - Yes.

230
00:06:54,510 --> 00:06:55,809
- "Unfortunately". - "Unfortunately".

231
00:06:55,809 --> 00:06:57,254
- "Unfortunately". - That's what it means?

232
00:06:57,720 --> 00:06:59,549
(With Haha who dreamed of flowing with hip-hop rhythms,)

233
00:06:59,549 --> 00:07:00,950
(the race will begin now.)

234
00:07:00,950 --> 00:07:04,194
As you can see from the set next to you,

235
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:07,189
it will be a couples' race. There will be six couples in all.

236
00:07:07,189 --> 00:07:08,704
- It's a couples' race. - It's a couples' race.

237
00:07:08,760 --> 00:07:10,600
- It's been a while since we had it. - Right.

238
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:12,030
Four female guests who will be...

239
00:07:12,030 --> 00:07:14,499
your partners along with Ji Hyo and So Min...

240
00:07:14,499 --> 00:07:15,905
are waiting in the back now.

241
00:07:17,270 --> 00:07:18,770
(4 female guests will be revealed shortly.)

242
00:07:18,770 --> 00:07:20,314
- in the back now. - Is that so?

243
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:23,379
Before we bring them in, you'll use a special method...

244
00:07:23,379 --> 00:07:25,640
- to choose your partners. - How?

245
00:07:25,640 --> 00:07:26,824
Bring in the table.

246
00:07:27,049 --> 00:07:28,184
"Special"?

247
00:07:28,379 --> 00:07:30,650
- What's that? - We'll blindly pick something.

248
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:32,624
- It's luck of the draw. - My gosh.

249
00:07:32,650 --> 00:07:33,749
Their faces?

250
00:07:33,749 --> 00:07:35,450
- Their faces? I see. - They stamped their faces.

251
00:07:35,450 --> 00:07:36,720
- Like the makeup. - They already stamped their faces.

252
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:38,160
We'll have to choose from this.

253
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:39,905
(How will we choose our partners with these cushions?)

254
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:41,965
Hello, welcome to Running Man.

255
00:07:42,059 --> 00:07:45,275
Today, six couples will be competing in the couples' race.

256
00:07:45,760 --> 00:07:47,545
There are no male guests today.

257
00:07:47,570 --> 00:07:48,944
Yes, I'm so excited.

258
00:07:48,970 --> 00:07:51,869
So everyone will clearly stamp your face...

259
00:07:51,869 --> 00:07:54,010
on the cushions in front of you.

260
00:07:54,010 --> 00:07:55,710
(The male members will choose the partner through the cushions.)

261
00:07:55,710 --> 00:07:58,585
(First up is So Min.)

262
00:07:58,939 --> 00:08:00,109
Goodness.

263
00:08:00,109 --> 00:08:01,884
So Min, that was too much.

264
00:08:03,119 --> 00:08:06,119
(Look! This is how we do things on Running Man.)

265
00:08:06,119 --> 00:08:07,264
So Min.

266
00:08:07,390 --> 00:08:08,564
Gosh. What is that?

267
00:08:08,820 --> 00:08:10,194
Her face disappeared.

268
00:08:11,390 --> 00:08:12,489
That was so tough.

269
00:08:12,489 --> 00:08:15,090
(They completed the stamping with the help of Ji Hyo and So Min.)

270
00:08:15,090 --> 00:08:18,304
Mine looks terrible. Only my nose and lips are crooked.

271
00:08:19,260 --> 00:08:21,499
You will choose the cushion you like...

272
00:08:21,499 --> 00:08:23,614
and stand behind the cushion.

273
00:08:23,739 --> 00:08:25,739
If there are more than one person behind a cushion,

274
00:08:25,739 --> 00:08:27,070
the female member will choose.

275
00:08:27,070 --> 00:08:28,910
If the female guest likes the male guest, they'll partner up.

276
00:08:28,910 --> 00:08:31,785
The members who are rejected will be on the waitlist.

277
00:08:31,879 --> 00:08:33,510
- Hey, that one is really thin. - Hey.

278
00:08:33,510 --> 00:08:35,085
- They all have my nose. - By the way...

279
00:08:35,309 --> 00:08:38,255
Hold on. This is a face of a woman?

280
00:08:38,379 --> 00:08:39,454
Are you sure?

281
00:08:39,950 --> 00:08:41,895
Aren't they all Dharma?

282
00:08:42,249 --> 00:08:44,659
By the way, the one with a clear stamp like this...

283
00:08:44,659 --> 00:08:46,590
- wants to stand out on the show. - That's right.

284
00:08:46,590 --> 00:08:48,560
- This imprint is strong too. - The ones with deep marks...

285
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:49,899
- want to be funny. - They must be comediennes.

286
00:08:49,899 --> 00:08:52,005
This person stamped it so hard that her nose got crooked.

287
00:08:52,629 --> 00:08:54,300
Didn't this person apply the lipstick afterward?

288
00:08:54,300 --> 00:08:56,499
- The lips are too red. - Didn't she?

289
00:08:56,499 --> 00:08:57,639
That's a strong color.

290
00:08:57,639 --> 00:08:59,070
- It is. It's strong. - The lighter ones are better.

291
00:08:59,070 --> 00:09:00,470
- She stamped her lips too. - Wait.

292
00:09:00,470 --> 00:09:01,810
Ji Hyo is wearing red lipstick today.

293
00:09:01,810 --> 00:09:02,984
Let's avoid this one.

294
00:09:03,379 --> 00:09:05,979
- You're right. - Ji Hyo and So Min's are here too.

295
00:09:05,979 --> 00:09:07,785
- We'll know by the lip color. - This one is nice.

296
00:09:08,149 --> 00:09:09,824
Did this person even try?

297
00:09:09,979 --> 00:09:11,295
- As for this person... - I have no idea.

298
00:09:11,580 --> 00:09:12,964
- This is so scary. - What is that?

299
00:09:13,389 --> 00:09:14,865
- It's so scary. - Her face looks like a Hahoe mask.

300
00:09:15,450 --> 00:09:17,265
She looks just like a Hahoe mask.

301
00:09:18,119 --> 00:09:19,259
Hey, isn't this obvious...

302
00:09:19,259 --> 00:09:20,704
Isn't it obvious that this is Na Rae's face?

303
00:09:21,060 --> 00:09:22,190
- I'm 100 percent sure. - Right.

304
00:09:22,190 --> 00:09:23,499
I'm not sure about this.

305
00:09:23,499 --> 00:09:24,529
(She has the same facial features with Na Rae.)

306
00:09:24,529 --> 00:09:25,659
I bet that's So Min's cushion.

307
00:09:25,659 --> 00:09:27,269
This one has to be So Min's.

308
00:09:27,269 --> 00:09:28,600
Look. This one has a wide face.

309
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:31,074
I really can't tell who they are by the marks.

310
00:09:31,170 --> 00:09:32,574
I really have no idea.

311
00:09:32,739 --> 00:09:34,184
How can we choose from these?

312
00:09:34,670 --> 00:09:37,109
- Let's take turns to pick. - Number six?

313
00:09:37,109 --> 00:09:39,409
- I'll take number 1. - You'll take number 1.

314
00:09:39,409 --> 00:09:40,450
- The makeup... - I'll go next.

315
00:09:40,450 --> 00:09:41,954
- Why did you choose this one? - Because...

316
00:09:42,279 --> 00:09:44,279
- she's wearing light makeup. - Because of the light makeup?

317
00:09:44,350 --> 00:09:45,594
- Light makeup. - That's Ji Hyo's.

318
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:47,019
Come on out, number four.

319
00:09:47,019 --> 00:09:48,420
(Haha chooses number 4, the ambitious entertainer.)

320
00:09:48,420 --> 00:09:50,535
I'll choose number five.

321
00:09:50,790 --> 00:09:51,960
I'll go with number three.

322
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:53,330
(Seok Jin chooses Dharma's lookalike.)

323
00:09:53,330 --> 00:09:55,229
- I'll go with number 6. - Number 6?

324
00:09:55,229 --> 00:09:56,804
Yes, I was going to choose this one from the get-go.

325
00:09:57,659 --> 00:09:59,204
I'll choose the one I'm mostly likely to win.

326
00:09:59,229 --> 00:10:00,300
I'll go with number six.

327
00:10:00,300 --> 00:10:02,399
(I'll choose the one I'm mostly likely to win.)

328
00:10:02,399 --> 00:10:03,739
(He chooses the same one as Se Chan.)

329
00:10:03,739 --> 00:10:05,045
There he goes again.

330
00:10:05,100 --> 00:10:06,615
Let's do this. Seriously.

331
00:10:06,670 --> 00:10:09,239
Hey, they... Do you know which one is yours?

332
00:10:09,239 --> 00:10:10,639
- Yes, we know. - We stamped our faces earlier.

333
00:10:10,639 --> 00:10:11,885
- Really? - You do?

334
00:10:12,340 --> 00:10:14,909
All right. We'll start from number one then.

335
00:10:14,909 --> 00:10:16,050
- Okay. - Number one.

336
00:10:16,050 --> 00:10:17,954
Number one, come on out.

337
00:10:18,080 --> 00:10:19,690
Who's number one? Who is it?

338
00:10:19,690 --> 00:10:21,795
Her makeup is light. She's wearing light makeup.

339
00:10:22,119 --> 00:10:23,295
Come on out, number one.

340
00:10:24,090 --> 00:10:25,820
- That's cute. - Who is she?

341
00:10:25,820 --> 00:10:27,759
- She has very small feet. - She's short.

342
00:10:27,759 --> 00:10:31,175
(Who is the 1st guest that exudes the presence of a cute girl?)

343
00:10:31,629 --> 00:10:33,170
- It's her. - It was Sunny.

344
00:10:33,170 --> 00:10:35,104
- It's been so long, Sunny. - Hey, Sunny.

345
00:10:35,930 --> 00:10:39,139
(She's our trustworthy leading vocalist in Girls' Generation.)

346
00:10:39,139 --> 00:10:42,710
(This witty and chatty energizer is a hit on variety shows.)

347
00:10:42,710 --> 00:10:46,285
(Sunny, the queen of cute acts that wins over people right away)

348
00:10:46,479 --> 00:10:47,885
(The 1st guest is Sunny, the Energizer.)

349
00:10:47,979 --> 00:10:49,109
(The 1st guest is Sunny, the Energizer.)

350
00:10:49,109 --> 00:10:50,724
- Sunny. - Sunny.

351
00:10:51,249 --> 00:10:52,320
- My gosh. - It's been so long, Sunny.

352
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:54,220
How long has it been?

353
00:10:54,220 --> 00:10:56,224
- Who picked number one? - Jong Kook.

354
00:10:56,420 --> 00:10:58,035
- Jong Kook. - It's me.

355
00:10:58,659 --> 00:11:00,529
- Hi. - It's you.

356
00:11:00,529 --> 00:11:02,729
- Soon Gyu, it's been a while. - It truly has been.

357
00:11:02,729 --> 00:11:04,359
- I'm Sunny. - No, you're Soon Gyu.

358
00:11:04,359 --> 00:11:05,930
- I'm Sunny. - Step back.

359
00:11:05,930 --> 00:11:07,470
- We're filming right now. - Sunny, you can refuse.

360
00:11:07,470 --> 00:11:09,229
- Hello. - It doesn't have to be Jong Kook.

361
00:11:09,229 --> 00:11:10,745
- Sunny, you can refuse. - Hello.

362
00:11:10,840 --> 00:11:11,899
- Hello. - It doesn't have to be Jong Kook.

363
00:11:11,899 --> 00:11:14,239
- Why would I refuse? - What?

364
00:11:14,239 --> 00:11:15,239
(Why would I refuse him?)

365
00:11:15,239 --> 00:11:17,454
- I'm just telling you. - Why would I refuse?

366
00:11:17,479 --> 00:11:19,214
Why would you say that?

367
00:11:19,580 --> 00:11:21,109
- She would've refused you. - "Why would I refuse?"

368
00:11:21,109 --> 00:11:22,950
They were a team back then.

369
00:11:23,019 --> 00:11:25,320
All right, let's reveal the second lady.

370
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:27,619
No one picked her.

371
00:11:27,619 --> 00:11:29,119
- Number two. - No one picked her?

372
00:11:29,119 --> 00:11:30,820
- No one picked her? - No one.

373
00:11:30,820 --> 00:11:33,635
- Her face was... - She looked like Jigsaw.

374
00:11:33,859 --> 00:11:35,834
- Please come on out. - I hope one of them steps up.

375
00:11:36,259 --> 00:11:37,330
Maybe it's Ji Hyo.

376
00:11:37,330 --> 00:11:40,300
(Is number 2 with the red lips Ji Hyo?)

377
00:11:40,300 --> 00:11:41,800
It's Ye Won!

378
00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:42,970
(It's Kim Ye Won, the beautiful, acting queen.)

379
00:11:42,970 --> 00:11:45,070
- My goodness. - Ye Won, is this you?

380
00:11:45,070 --> 00:11:46,375
Yes.

381
00:11:46,909 --> 00:11:49,840
(She's the charming girl from "Sunny".)

382
00:11:49,840 --> 00:11:52,684
(She has a beautiful face and amazing acting skills.)

383
00:11:53,580 --> 00:11:57,249
(Number 2 is Kim Ye Won, the newly rising actress.)

384
00:11:57,249 --> 00:11:58,720
(This face is you?)

385
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:00,090
My gosh.

386
00:12:00,090 --> 00:12:02,765
- Hello. - She plays that bad girl in that...

387
00:12:03,359 --> 00:12:05,434
- Can we switch? - No.

388
00:12:05,460 --> 00:12:07,729
- We can't? - Is it too late?

389
00:12:07,729 --> 00:12:10,060
- Ye Won, please stand there. - Okay.

390
00:12:10,060 --> 00:12:11,100
All right.

391
00:12:11,100 --> 00:12:13,104
- How could no one pick me? - Next up.

392
00:12:14,269 --> 00:12:17,115
Excuse me. So Min and Ji Hyo should go in there.

393
00:12:17,139 --> 00:12:18,545
Should we?

394
00:12:18,840 --> 00:12:20,145
We shall.

395
00:12:20,509 --> 00:12:24,354
- Did Seok Jin choose number three? - Yes.

396
00:12:24,479 --> 00:12:26,580
Please come on out.

397
00:12:26,580 --> 00:12:28,310
(Who is Seok Jin's number 3 who looks like Dharma?)

398
00:12:28,310 --> 00:12:29,454
Who could it be?

399
00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:30,820
Who is that?

400
00:12:30,820 --> 00:12:32,050
No, it's a guest.

401
00:12:32,050 --> 00:12:33,295
It's a guest.

402
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:38,665
(It's Song Ji Hyo, the sister of Running Man.)

403
00:12:39,420 --> 00:12:41,064
(He tosses the cushion.)

404
00:12:41,129 --> 00:12:43,259
Did you see what he just did?

405
00:12:43,259 --> 00:12:45,405
- I'm sorry about that. - I'm sorry.

406
00:12:45,460 --> 00:12:46,800
- We couldn't react well. - By the way,

407
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:48,405
- Ji Hyo could refuse him. - You're too harsh.

408
00:12:48,430 --> 00:12:50,769
I'm sorry. It was a force of habit.

409
00:12:50,769 --> 00:12:51,940
- I'm really excited. - She could refuse him.

410
00:12:51,940 --> 00:12:53,670
- It was a force of habit. - She could.

411
00:12:53,670 --> 00:12:54,909
Don't refuse him!

412
00:12:54,909 --> 00:12:57,139
If you refuse, you'll get tossed around.

413
00:12:57,139 --> 00:12:59,854
(The matching won't end anytime soon.)

414
00:13:00,649 --> 00:13:02,724
- You'll have to take him. - It won't end.

415
00:13:02,779 --> 00:13:04,779
- It really won't end. - Please pick.

416
00:13:04,779 --> 00:13:06,019
You should embrace him.

417
00:13:06,019 --> 00:13:08,519
- You're definitely... - It looks like his nose.

418
00:13:08,519 --> 00:13:09,790
- It's me. - I didn't know it was her.

419
00:13:09,790 --> 00:13:11,920
- I had no idea either. - It doesn't look like her.

420
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:13,234
Next is number four.

421
00:13:13,430 --> 00:13:14,989
I picked number four.

422
00:13:14,989 --> 00:13:16,029
Okay, which number is it?

423
00:13:16,029 --> 00:13:17,200
- Number four. - Okay.

424
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:18,934
Come on out.

425
00:13:19,259 --> 00:13:20,944
She must like to act funny.

426
00:13:21,399 --> 00:13:23,300
She's like a comedienne.

427
00:13:23,300 --> 00:13:24,415
(Who could this funny lady be?)

428
00:13:26,269 --> 00:13:27,710
- Goodness! - SUNMI!

429
00:13:27,710 --> 00:13:29,885
(She's the rising solo queen, SUNMI.)

430
00:13:30,080 --> 00:13:32,009
(She's known for her uniqueness and amazing performances.)

431
00:13:32,009 --> 00:13:34,885
(Every single music of hers is on the charts.)

432
00:13:35,350 --> 00:13:40,365
(She conquered variety shows with her surprising charms.)

433
00:13:41,019 --> 00:13:46,734
(Everyone fell in love with her charms.)

434
00:13:48,029 --> 00:13:51,529
(SUNMI is number 4.)

435
00:13:51,529 --> 00:13:52,899
(He's happy to see her.)

436
00:13:52,899 --> 00:13:54,405
We're a team again.

437
00:13:54,729 --> 00:13:56,700
- My gosh. - We're a team again?

438
00:13:56,700 --> 00:13:58,070
- No way. - No way.

439
00:13:58,070 --> 00:13:59,375
- We're a team. - We're done for.

440
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:00,745
It's So Min.

441
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:03,015
I'm so happy to see you.

442
00:14:03,070 --> 00:14:04,210
My gosh.

443
00:14:04,210 --> 00:14:05,385
SUNMI. You can refuse him.

444
00:14:05,639 --> 00:14:08,210
- You can refuse him! - SUNMI.

445
00:14:08,210 --> 00:14:09,554
Who's left?

446
00:14:09,710 --> 00:14:11,854
There's Jae Seok and Se Chan.

447
00:14:11,979 --> 00:14:13,224
- And me. - And Kwang Soo.

448
00:14:14,489 --> 00:14:17,495
I'll refuse.

449
00:14:18,159 --> 00:14:19,365
Really?

450
00:14:19,989 --> 00:14:21,234
Okay!

451
00:14:21,330 --> 00:14:23,529
You were so happy to see her.

452
00:14:23,529 --> 00:14:25,659
- What's wrong with him today? - It's his birthday.

453
00:14:25,659 --> 00:14:26,769
- It's his birthday today. - Seriously?

454
00:14:26,769 --> 00:14:28,170
- I'm so sorry! - It's his birthday.

455
00:14:28,170 --> 00:14:30,474
It's okay. Just think of it as your gift to him.

456
00:14:30,670 --> 00:14:31,944
- I'm sorry. - It's okay.

457
00:14:32,470 --> 00:14:33,710
- It's okay. - He must be hurt.

458
00:14:33,710 --> 00:14:35,385
They even hugged each other.

459
00:14:36,109 --> 00:14:37,379
Next is me.

460
00:14:37,379 --> 00:14:40,009
- Both 5 and 6 will appear together. - Number 5.

461
00:14:40,009 --> 00:14:41,080
- Together? - Yes.

462
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:43,149
- One of them is So Min. - You're right.

463
00:14:43,149 --> 00:14:44,580
- Please. - One.

464
00:14:44,580 --> 00:14:46,054
(1 of the 2 is So Min's face.)

465
00:14:46,379 --> 00:14:49,350
(Could Jae Seok's pick be her?)

466
00:14:49,350 --> 00:14:52,834
(Or could Kwang Soo and Se Chan's pick be her?)

467
00:14:52,889 --> 00:14:53,930
Two.

468
00:14:53,930 --> 00:14:55,889
(The rest of the day depends on this.)

469
00:14:55,889 --> 00:14:56,960
Three.

470
00:14:56,960 --> 00:14:58,600
(Please let the guest be number 6.)

471
00:14:58,600 --> 00:14:59,775
Who is it?

472
00:15:00,129 --> 00:15:01,129
Who is it?

473
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:02,405
So Min.

474
00:15:02,629 --> 00:15:03,840
- No. - Hello.

475
00:15:03,840 --> 00:15:05,015
It's Ye Won.

476
00:15:06,170 --> 00:15:08,239
(She's the smiley announcer who looks like...)

477
00:15:08,239 --> 00:15:10,385
(she'd only bring good news.)

478
00:15:10,680 --> 00:15:12,680
(With her friendliness and way of emceeing,)

479
00:15:12,680 --> 00:15:14,755
(she's conquered educational and variety programs.)

480
00:15:15,649 --> 00:15:17,879
(Today, she'll be doing field work.)

481
00:15:17,879 --> 00:15:18,920
- Right. - She's an announcer.

482
00:15:18,920 --> 00:15:20,224
Ye Won.

483
00:15:20,350 --> 00:15:21,619
- It's been a long time. - I'm so happy to see you.

484
00:15:21,619 --> 00:15:23,734
- It's been a long time. - It has been.

485
00:15:24,220 --> 00:15:26,659
(And another lady walks in amidst the indifference.)

486
00:15:26,659 --> 00:15:28,259
(Hello)

487
00:15:28,259 --> 00:15:29,365
Are you number six?

488
00:15:30,159 --> 00:15:31,930
Their numbers are important.

489
00:15:31,930 --> 00:15:33,229
- We don't know who picked what. - All right.

490
00:15:33,229 --> 00:15:35,775
1 of them is 5, and the other one is 6.

491
00:15:36,499 --> 00:15:37,769
- All right. - Okay.

492
00:15:37,769 --> 00:15:39,814
- Whose is it? - Ye Won is...

493
00:15:40,340 --> 00:15:41,515
number five.

494
00:15:41,540 --> 00:15:43,045
(Jae Seok picked Ye Won.)

495
00:15:43,979 --> 00:15:45,684
- So Min is number 6. - Ye Won is number 5.

496
00:15:46,310 --> 00:15:48,054
Doesn't only one of us survive?

497
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:50,879
I was popular.

498
00:15:50,879 --> 00:15:52,194
(Se Chan kicks cushion number 6.)

499
00:15:52,279 --> 00:15:53,995
(He's in a hurry.)

500
00:15:54,420 --> 00:15:56,125
I was popular.

501
00:15:56,790 --> 00:15:58,960
- My cushion was so popular. - Again!

502
00:15:58,960 --> 00:16:01,529
- One of us needs to... - I'll switch to number two.

503
00:16:01,529 --> 00:16:02,665
Hey.

504
00:16:03,399 --> 00:16:06,875
- So Min can pick one of them. - They'll be fighting for her.

505
00:16:07,170 --> 00:16:09,369
- So Min, please pick. - This feels great.

506
00:16:09,369 --> 00:16:11,399
I feel so great. Two people picked my cushion.

507
00:16:11,399 --> 00:16:12,970
I was so startled to see both of you pick it.

508
00:16:12,970 --> 00:16:14,509
- All right. - One of us has to be a couple?

509
00:16:14,509 --> 00:16:15,684
Of course.

510
00:16:15,769 --> 00:16:17,115
Where do you think you're going?

511
00:16:17,409 --> 00:16:20,184
I'd like you to sing a song.

512
00:16:20,879 --> 00:16:22,580
(Criteria for becoming her partner: Singing ability)

513
00:16:22,580 --> 00:16:24,954
- I'd like a love song. - A love song?

514
00:16:25,119 --> 00:16:26,850
- A love song? - Yes.

515
00:16:26,850 --> 00:16:28,724
- Please sing one measure. - Do it.

516
00:16:29,149 --> 00:16:30,334
Hurry up.

517
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:33,729
(I love you)

518
00:16:33,729 --> 00:16:36,635
(The only thing I can say)

519
00:16:36,659 --> 00:16:37,759
(Halfhearted)

520
00:16:37,759 --> 00:16:39,675
He's singing so halfheartedly.

521
00:16:39,859 --> 00:16:41,505
- It's too halfhearted. - It's a love song.

522
00:16:41,629 --> 00:16:42,804
Hurry up.

523
00:16:42,999 --> 00:16:48,810
(Singing)

524
00:16:48,810 --> 00:16:50,755
(My love)

525
00:16:51,109 --> 00:16:53,214
(He doesn't finish singing.)

526
00:16:54,350 --> 00:16:55,484
So Min.

527
00:16:55,710 --> 00:16:57,149
She might pick the one...

528
00:16:57,149 --> 00:16:58,619
- who's not putting in much effort. - I gave my all.

529
00:16:58,619 --> 00:16:59,820
She might do that.

530
00:16:59,820 --> 00:17:02,665
(My love for you)

531
00:17:03,460 --> 00:17:05,265
(They do their best.)

532
00:17:05,759 --> 00:17:06,960
(She's happy to see them fight.)

533
00:17:06,960 --> 00:17:08,135
All right.

534
00:17:08,229 --> 00:17:10,129
So Min, please pick.

535
00:17:10,129 --> 00:17:11,734
I'd like you to do rock-paper-scissors.

536
00:17:11,859 --> 00:17:13,274
- Rock-paper-scissors. - Rock-paper-scissors.

537
00:17:13,369 --> 00:17:14,905
Do we need to win or lose?

538
00:17:14,929 --> 00:17:16,840
- If you win, you become partners. - You need to win.

539
00:17:16,840 --> 00:17:17,899
You need to win.

540
00:17:17,899 --> 00:17:19,214
- I'll pick the winner. - Okay.

541
00:17:19,600 --> 00:17:22,409
- Rock-paper-scissors - Rock-paper-scissors

542
00:17:22,409 --> 00:17:23,754
(It's a draw.)

543
00:17:25,439 --> 00:17:26,615
What was that?

544
00:17:26,780 --> 00:17:28,909
(It's neck and neck.)

545
00:17:28,909 --> 00:17:30,520
What was that?

546
00:17:30,520 --> 00:17:31,794
Are you trying to win?

547
00:17:31,879 --> 00:17:33,155
You are, right?

548
00:17:33,250 --> 00:17:34,419
- You are, right? - Yes.

549
00:17:34,419 --> 00:17:35,895
- I can't do this. - Again.

550
00:17:36,919 --> 00:17:37,990
- Rock-paper-scissors - Rock-paper-scissors

551
00:17:37,990 --> 00:17:39,595
(It's a draw once again.)

552
00:17:41,359 --> 00:17:44,004
(They're betting everything on this.)

553
00:17:44,199 --> 00:17:45,504
This feels great.

554
00:17:46,429 --> 00:17:48,774
If they make a draw once again, maybe they should all be a team.

555
00:17:49,070 --> 00:17:51,139
- I'll give you 10 dollars. - Rock-paper...

556
00:17:51,199 --> 00:17:52,740
- I'll give you 100 dollars. - Rock...

557
00:17:52,740 --> 00:17:54,070
(They try to fix the match by offering money.)

558
00:17:54,070 --> 00:17:55,214
Rock...

559
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:57,010
- My gosh. - What's wrong?

560
00:17:57,080 --> 00:17:59,679
- Rock-paper-scissors - Rock-paper-scissors

561
00:17:59,679 --> 00:18:01,149
(Se Chan wins.)

562
00:18:01,149 --> 00:18:02,350
- Yes! - Yes!

563
00:18:02,350 --> 00:18:03,794
(He will be So Min's partner.)

564
00:18:05,020 --> 00:18:06,320
(He was happy at first...)

565
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:07,449
(and then realized the prize.)

566
00:18:07,449 --> 00:18:09,825
(I've won.)

567
00:18:10,760 --> 00:18:12,189
- By the way, - They're meant to be.

568
00:18:12,189 --> 00:18:13,504
So Min got her way.

569
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:16,034
- They're meant to be. - She likes Se Chan.

570
00:18:16,560 --> 00:18:18,600
- Everything went her way. - You've won me.

571
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:21,204
- You've won me. - She said I've won her.

572
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:23,204
"You've won me."

573
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:26,669
Hold on. Jae Seok hasn't been chosen yet.

574
00:18:26,669 --> 00:18:28,815
- Ye Won needs to pick him. - Right.

575
00:18:29,609 --> 00:18:31,810
- Ye Won. - You can refuse him.

576
00:18:31,810 --> 00:18:34,149
Don't fool yourself that all announcers like you.

577
00:18:34,149 --> 00:18:36,125
Okay.

578
00:18:36,949 --> 00:18:39,395
Ye Won, don't worry.

579
00:18:39,480 --> 00:18:41,425
I'm very nonchalant, so don't worry.

580
00:18:41,790 --> 00:18:42,964
Hurry up.

581
00:18:43,020 --> 00:18:47,790
- Someone else wants me too. - Who?

582
00:18:47,790 --> 00:18:49,234
Who wants you?

583
00:18:49,330 --> 00:18:51,030
- You better watch your mouth. - Hey.

584
00:18:51,030 --> 00:18:52,659
- Are you going somewhere? - Never mind.

585
00:18:52,659 --> 00:18:54,469
- There's someone you want. - No, it's not that.

586
00:18:54,469 --> 00:18:56,675
I didn't want to burden her.

587
00:18:56,840 --> 00:18:59,540
I'd like to meet the other members.

588
00:18:59,540 --> 00:19:00,669
- Okay! - Okay!

589
00:19:00,669 --> 00:19:02,714
(She makes her decision.)

590
00:19:03,139 --> 00:19:05,379
- Okay! - Okay!

591
00:19:05,379 --> 00:19:07,085
Hey, go away!

592
00:19:07,179 --> 00:19:08,355
Go away!

593
00:19:09,149 --> 00:19:11,280
- Okay! - You acted so arrogantly.

594
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:13,155
Okay. Okay.

595
00:19:13,379 --> 00:19:15,694
- Hey. - He's blushing!

596
00:19:16,550 --> 00:19:19,119
Okay! Number five! Fine.

597
00:19:19,119 --> 00:19:22,004
Those who have been rejected, gather here.

598
00:19:22,129 --> 00:19:23,459
You can choose those who already have partners too.

599
00:19:23,459 --> 00:19:24,859
Then the men will make the choice.

600
00:19:24,859 --> 00:19:26,830
You can pick them too?

601
00:19:26,830 --> 00:19:28,100
The men will make the choice.

602
00:19:28,100 --> 00:19:29,429
- It's not over. - Really?

603
00:19:29,429 --> 00:19:30,439
I still have a chance.

604
00:19:30,439 --> 00:19:33,270
Then let's start with Ye Won.

605
00:19:33,270 --> 00:19:34,570
(They begin with Ye Won who wasn't picked at all.)

606
00:19:34,570 --> 00:19:35,709
- I'd like... - Pick someone...

607
00:19:35,709 --> 00:19:36,885
you're comfortable with.

608
00:19:37,310 --> 00:19:39,179
I'd like to pick Kwang Soo with whom I've worked with.

609
00:19:39,179 --> 00:19:40,355
Yes!

610
00:19:40,550 --> 00:19:42,050
(She chooses him because they've worked together before.)

611
00:19:42,050 --> 00:19:43,224
If this is the case...

612
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:45,550
- Did you just accept her? - If this is the case...

613
00:19:45,550 --> 00:19:46,754
Can I refuse?

614
00:19:47,290 --> 00:19:48,494
Can I?

615
00:19:48,850 --> 00:19:50,595
If I can refuse, then I will.

616
00:19:50,689 --> 00:19:51,790
Really?

617
00:19:51,790 --> 00:19:53,335
(It's a turn of events.)

618
00:19:53,530 --> 00:19:54,530
Really?

619
00:19:54,530 --> 00:19:55,530
- No way. - Kwang Soo.

620
00:19:55,530 --> 00:19:56,764
- Did you refuse? - What?

621
00:19:56,929 --> 00:19:57,959
What is this?

622
00:19:57,959 --> 00:19:59,300
(She's the first guest to be rejected by him.)

623
00:19:59,300 --> 00:20:00,730
- I mean... - Let's talk.

624
00:20:00,730 --> 00:20:02,605
It's not like that.

625
00:20:02,869 --> 00:20:04,600
We're just really close, that's all.

626
00:20:04,600 --> 00:20:05,774
(He doesn't know what to do.)

627
00:20:06,040 --> 00:20:08,540
Ye Won, this is a dog-eat-dog show.

628
00:20:08,540 --> 00:20:09,845
I'm sorry.

629
00:20:09,939 --> 00:20:11,109
Next up is SUNMI.

630
00:20:11,109 --> 00:20:12,340
I pick...

631
00:20:12,340 --> 00:20:13,439
(Whom will she pick?)

632
00:20:13,439 --> 00:20:14,580
Kwang Soo.

633
00:20:14,580 --> 00:20:16,425
(She also picks him.)

634
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:18,595
He's so popular.

635
00:20:19,119 --> 00:20:20,794
- He's so popular. - Why did you pick him?

636
00:20:20,850 --> 00:20:22,020
(SUNMI is nervous.)

637
00:20:22,020 --> 00:20:23,264
- Kwang Soo. - She picked him.

638
00:20:23,389 --> 00:20:27,635
- 1, 2, 3. - Ye Won is glaring at him.

639
00:20:28,760 --> 00:20:29,830
I'd like to refuse.

640
00:20:29,830 --> 00:20:31,004
Why are you playing hard to get?

641
00:20:31,030 --> 00:20:33,429
(Now, he's refused SUNMI's offer as well.)

642
00:20:33,429 --> 00:20:35,744
You have your eyes set on Jang Ye Won, don't you?

643
00:20:35,899 --> 00:20:37,000
Hey, watch what you say.

644
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:38,415
- You could end up with So Min. - Wake up!

645
00:20:38,969 --> 00:20:41,214
They'd become so awkward if they met like this.

646
00:20:41,609 --> 00:20:42,784
Ye Won.

647
00:20:44,379 --> 00:20:45,615
This is hard.

648
00:20:46,139 --> 00:20:49,984
Ye Won. 1, 2, 3.

649
00:20:50,280 --> 00:20:51,850
(Kwang Soo was straightforward,)

650
00:20:51,850 --> 00:20:54,024
(but Jae Seok and Haha had no chance to appeal.)

651
00:20:54,090 --> 00:20:56,520
(Who will Ye Won choose?)

652
00:20:56,520 --> 00:21:00,095
I'll make an honest choice. I choose Jong Kook.

653
00:21:03,389 --> 00:21:05,159
- What does that make us? - Seriously?

654
00:21:05,159 --> 00:21:06,504
What about us then?

655
00:21:06,659 --> 00:21:08,330
(Me?)

656
00:21:08,330 --> 00:21:09,974
Seriously?

657
00:21:10,600 --> 00:21:12,774
- Kwang Soo, you can go home now. - The losers!

658
00:21:12,899 --> 00:21:14,684
What about us then?

659
00:21:14,840 --> 00:21:16,270
- Jong Kook... - Yes.

660
00:21:16,270 --> 00:21:18,915
- Me? - He's quite popular too.

661
00:21:19,010 --> 00:21:20,649
You have to choose between her and Sunny.

662
00:21:20,649 --> 00:21:21,909
It's her or Sunny.

663
00:21:21,909 --> 00:21:25,050
Can you tell us why you chose Jong Kook?

664
00:21:25,119 --> 00:21:28,694
I've never met him before, so I'm curious.

665
00:21:29,490 --> 00:21:31,595
Is it because you saw me for the first time?

666
00:21:31,719 --> 00:21:33,119
Unbelievable. We haven't met either.

667
00:21:33,119 --> 00:21:34,434
Do you know what's funny?

668
00:21:35,030 --> 00:21:36,230
Unbelievable.

669
00:21:36,230 --> 00:21:38,300
(Is that your reason for choosing him?)

670
00:21:38,300 --> 00:21:40,274
- We haven't met. - Don't say it like that.

671
00:21:40,300 --> 00:21:42,100
- Gosh. - You haven't met me either.

672
00:21:42,129 --> 00:21:43,600
Gosh, I'm so sorry.

673
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:45,175
We haven't met, you know.

674
00:21:45,270 --> 00:21:47,770
No way. Is he making a fuss over this?

675
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:49,310
- Ye Won, how could you? - You only saw me on TV.

676
00:21:49,310 --> 00:21:50,909
I know. We haven't met either.

677
00:21:50,909 --> 00:21:52,209
Jong Kook, make up your mind.

678
00:21:52,209 --> 00:21:54,310
What? Well, Sunny...

679
00:21:54,310 --> 00:21:55,780
(So why did Sunny choose Jong Kook?)

680
00:21:55,780 --> 00:21:56,810
You're my dream guy.

681
00:21:56,810 --> 00:21:58,050
Her dream guy!

682
00:21:58,050 --> 00:21:59,724
(You're my dream guy.)

683
00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:02,119
- Just like that? - That's out of the blue.

684
00:22:02,119 --> 00:22:05,520
We've known each other for a while, so when did that happen?

685
00:22:05,560 --> 00:22:09,105
How could I have suddenly become your dream guy?

686
00:22:09,159 --> 00:22:11,230
Okay. Even though she might've not meant it,

687
00:22:11,230 --> 00:22:12,899
I choose Sunny.

688
00:22:12,899 --> 00:22:15,330
- Okay. - I choose Sunny.

689
00:22:15,330 --> 00:22:17,070
(I should've said something better.)

690
00:22:17,070 --> 00:22:18,939
- Gosh. - So we're back to square one.

691
00:22:18,939 --> 00:22:19,969
He stuck with his original partner.

692
00:22:19,969 --> 00:22:21,310
All options are open!

693
00:22:21,310 --> 00:22:23,879
- Right. - The market is open.

694
00:22:23,879 --> 00:22:26,280
Let's go. We start with Kim Ye Won again.

695
00:22:26,280 --> 00:22:27,655
I choose Jae Seok.

696
00:22:27,679 --> 00:22:28,954
Okay!

697
00:22:29,850 --> 00:22:31,494
- I choose Kwang Soo. - Okay.

698
00:22:32,520 --> 00:22:33,949
(I'm sorry about last time.)

699
00:22:33,949 --> 00:22:34,949
Then...

700
00:22:34,949 --> 00:22:37,619
Haha, be my partner.

701
00:22:37,619 --> 00:22:39,095
(She's the only one left.)

702
00:22:39,119 --> 00:22:40,830
- What's there to think about? - Please?

703
00:22:40,830 --> 00:22:42,305
- There's nothing to think about. - Please.

704
00:22:42,389 --> 00:22:44,034
Beg some more.

705
00:22:44,500 --> 00:22:46,330
Haha, please.

706
00:22:46,330 --> 00:22:48,669
She dropped to her knees!

707
00:22:48,669 --> 00:22:51,300
- Okay, you can get up now. - Okay!

708
00:22:51,300 --> 00:22:53,000
(Ye Won and Haha become the final couple.)

709
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:54,270
Okay.

710
00:22:54,270 --> 00:22:55,609
(The couples: Jae Seok and Ye Won, Sunny and Jong Kook,)

711
00:22:55,609 --> 00:22:56,740
(Haha and Ye Won, Se Chan and So Min,)

712
00:22:56,740 --> 00:22:58,014
(Kwang Soo and SUNMI, Seok Jin and Ji Hyo)

713
00:22:58,679 --> 00:23:01,655
The one happiest with her partner is So Min.

714
00:23:02,149 --> 00:23:03,209
(Se Chan isn't my type.)

715
00:23:03,209 --> 00:23:04,879
She keeps mimicking Sunny.

716
00:23:04,879 --> 00:23:07,024
"You're my dream guy."

717
00:23:08,050 --> 00:23:09,724
(Just a while ago)

718
00:23:11,419 --> 00:23:12,794
"You're my dream guy."

719
00:23:13,320 --> 00:23:14,689
Stop it already.

720
00:23:14,689 --> 00:23:15,805
(It's too cheesy.)

721
00:23:16,530 --> 00:23:18,004
It's what Sunny said.

722
00:23:18,030 --> 00:23:19,230
"You're my dream guy."

723
00:23:19,230 --> 00:23:20,530
- Is that so? - Yes.

724
00:23:20,530 --> 00:23:22,244
(So Min learned a bad thing from Sunny.)

725
00:23:22,300 --> 00:23:24,340
- Really? - "You're my dream guy."

726
00:23:24,340 --> 00:23:25,840
She keeps on mimicking Sunny.

727
00:23:25,899 --> 00:23:29,040
You'll only confuse Se Chan, so cut it out.

728
00:23:29,040 --> 00:23:31,510
Why are you angry about it though?

729
00:23:31,510 --> 00:23:32,580
(Is he jealous?)

730
00:23:32,580 --> 00:23:34,379
- Why are you angry? - What was that?

731
00:23:34,379 --> 00:23:35,709
- That's so weird. - Know your place!

732
00:23:35,709 --> 00:23:37,754
The timing was so off.

733
00:23:37,780 --> 00:23:39,320
Why would you get angry about it?

734
00:23:39,320 --> 00:23:40,490
I'm worried about Se Chan.

735
00:23:40,490 --> 00:23:42,520
- Me? - I don't want him to get hurt.

736
00:23:42,520 --> 00:23:46,590
Since it's hot outside, we'll keep the interview short.

737
00:23:46,590 --> 00:23:49,105
First, we'll start with SUNMI.

738
00:23:49,859 --> 00:23:52,004
- Hello. - A new song must be out.

739
00:23:52,129 --> 00:23:53,429
Yes, that's right.

740
00:23:53,429 --> 00:23:55,300
Tell us about that new song then.

741
00:23:55,300 --> 00:23:57,869
Actually, I released a song...

742
00:23:57,869 --> 00:24:01,209
that directly aims at "Apgujeong Nallari" by Jae Seok.

743
00:24:01,209 --> 00:24:03,780
- It's called "LALALAY". - "LALALAY"?

744
00:24:03,780 --> 00:24:04,840
Really?

745
00:24:04,840 --> 00:24:05,939
I'd love to hear the song.

746
00:24:05,939 --> 00:24:08,109
Then can you show us how the song goes?

747
00:24:08,109 --> 00:24:09,425
It'll be good.

748
00:24:09,510 --> 00:24:11,294
(They look forward to the master performer.)

749
00:24:13,149 --> 00:24:14,224
(Hey!)

750
00:24:20,530 --> 00:24:22,389
(They react to the shocking punch.)

751
00:24:22,389 --> 00:24:23,734
Amazing.

752
00:24:24,530 --> 00:24:25,699
(The artist is back with a richer vibe.)

753
00:24:25,699 --> 00:24:29,004
Look at her playing with her hair.

754
00:24:29,929 --> 00:24:31,040
This is awesome.

755
00:24:31,040 --> 00:24:33,444
(Then she slows down into a thrust!)

756
00:24:35,209 --> 00:24:37,010
You'll scrape your knees.

757
00:24:37,010 --> 00:24:38,639
You'll get burned by the asphalt.

758
00:24:38,639 --> 00:24:41,284
(The feeble men of the show worry about her getting hurt.)

759
00:24:41,550 --> 00:24:43,209
(She completes "LALALAY" in one piece.)

760
00:24:43,209 --> 00:24:44,219
This will be a hit.

761
00:24:44,219 --> 00:24:45,619
That was awesome!

762
00:24:45,619 --> 00:24:47,520
Did you see that killer move?

763
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:49,320
SUNMI, that was amazing.

764
00:24:49,320 --> 00:24:50,760
It's another big hit.

765
00:24:50,760 --> 00:24:52,020
Her songs never get old.

766
00:24:52,020 --> 00:24:55,734
Above everything else, this song made the biggest impact.

767
00:24:55,790 --> 00:24:58,230
- Nothing's better in the heat. - That's right.

768
00:24:58,230 --> 00:25:00,530
Also, she's here to promote the song anyway.

769
00:25:00,530 --> 00:25:02,774
- Her goal has been met. - She's not just here for that.

770
00:25:02,899 --> 00:25:06,369
All right then. Next, we have an artist...

771
00:25:06,369 --> 00:25:08,909
who's the senior among most girl groups.

772
00:25:08,909 --> 00:25:10,909
She's like Kyun Mi Ri of the K-pop industry.

773
00:25:10,909 --> 00:25:13,085
(To put it simply...)

774
00:25:13,340 --> 00:25:14,609
(The actor who's been in the spotlight for a long time.)

775
00:25:14,609 --> 00:25:16,409
Don't you agree?

776
00:25:16,409 --> 00:25:17,879
She's like King Taejo of the K-pop industry.

777
00:25:17,879 --> 00:25:19,419
Please welcome Sunny!

778
00:25:19,419 --> 00:25:20,419
(Sunny also known as Soon Gyu)

779
00:25:20,419 --> 00:25:22,020
It's Sunny!

780
00:25:22,020 --> 00:25:25,320
I'm not just saying this, but Sunny's always the same.

781
00:25:25,320 --> 00:25:26,719
I concur.

782
00:25:26,719 --> 00:25:27,859
- Exactly. - Thank you.

783
00:25:27,859 --> 00:25:30,060
She hasn't changed since she debuted.

784
00:25:30,060 --> 00:25:31,129
- You're the same. - Really?

785
00:25:31,129 --> 00:25:32,530
- Right? - That's not true.

786
00:25:32,530 --> 00:25:34,704
What's the secret to your self-maintenance?

787
00:25:34,929 --> 00:25:37,244
- I sleep a lot. - I see.

788
00:25:37,439 --> 00:25:39,345
When I get stressed...

789
00:25:39,500 --> 00:25:40,570
So you drink.

790
00:25:40,570 --> 00:25:42,010
You're just like Ji Hyo.

791
00:25:42,010 --> 00:25:43,439
She sleeps a lot too.

792
00:25:43,439 --> 00:25:46,310
- I rest when I'm stressed. - I like staying at home.

793
00:25:46,310 --> 00:25:48,480
They're not at all the same...

794
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:50,649
because Ji Hyo's not the cute type.

795
00:25:50,649 --> 00:25:52,294
(Unlike Sunny...)

796
00:25:52,379 --> 00:25:54,590
- Meanwhile, Sunny is super cute. - Exactly.

797
00:25:54,590 --> 00:25:57,719
I'm cute too, you know.

798
00:25:57,719 --> 00:26:00,605
You're my dream guy.

799
00:26:01,389 --> 00:26:02,659
You're my dream guy!

800
00:26:02,659 --> 00:26:04,330
- Jong Kook hates it. - You're my dream guy.

801
00:26:04,330 --> 00:26:06,060
My heart almost stopped.

802
00:26:06,060 --> 00:26:07,600
You're my dream guy!

803
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:09,030
Ji Hyo, try this.

804
00:26:09,030 --> 00:26:11,169
- My heart almost stopped. - I'm a troublemaker!

805
00:26:11,169 --> 00:26:12,199
(Jong Kook!)

806
00:26:12,199 --> 00:26:13,845
(I was wrong to say that.)

807
00:26:13,909 --> 00:26:15,409
I'm a troublemaker.

808
00:26:15,409 --> 00:26:16,714
That was good, Ji Hyo.

809
00:26:17,010 --> 00:26:19,139
- She's gotten better. - How amazing is her acting?

810
00:26:19,139 --> 00:26:20,409
She was relentless.

811
00:26:20,409 --> 00:26:22,109
- Ji Hyo... - She forced herself to do it.

812
00:26:22,109 --> 00:26:23,580
That was relentless of her.

813
00:26:23,580 --> 00:26:25,050
Good job, Ji Hyo.

814
00:26:25,050 --> 00:26:26,949
Why on earth does she like Jong Kook?

815
00:26:26,949 --> 00:26:29,694
I've known her for over 10 years now.

816
00:26:29,850 --> 00:26:31,520
- Unbelievable. - Now she says I'm her dream guy.

817
00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:33,959
There's a script which girl group members can follow.

818
00:26:33,959 --> 00:26:36,389
- What kind of script? - How to avoid questions about men.

819
00:26:36,389 --> 00:26:37,760
Really?

820
00:26:37,760 --> 00:26:39,300
Ask if she has a boyfriend.

821
00:26:39,300 --> 00:26:40,830
Sunny, are you seeing someone?

822
00:26:40,830 --> 00:26:42,230
My fans are my boyfriends.

823
00:26:42,230 --> 00:26:43,429
See?

824
00:26:43,429 --> 00:26:46,214
(My fans are my boyfriends.)

825
00:26:47,510 --> 00:26:49,240
- What did I tell you? - Still?

826
00:26:49,270 --> 00:26:50,740
She answered before he finished his question.

827
00:26:50,810 --> 00:26:52,010
They have scripts.

828
00:26:52,010 --> 00:26:54,609
Are they provided by SM Entertainment?

829
00:26:54,609 --> 00:26:56,850
- Are they? - A new one is released annually.

830
00:26:56,850 --> 00:26:58,619
Ji Hyo, do you have a boyfriend?

831
00:26:58,619 --> 00:26:59,694
I...

832
00:26:59,850 --> 00:27:00,990
will soon have one.

833
00:27:01,050 --> 00:27:02,565
What are you saying?

834
00:27:02,619 --> 00:27:04,219
He's my dream guy!

835
00:27:04,219 --> 00:27:06,464
(Here's my boyfriend.)

836
00:27:06,760 --> 00:27:08,330
- What... - What's wrong with you?

837
00:27:08,330 --> 00:27:10,600
- My dream guy. - Seriously?

838
00:27:10,600 --> 00:27:12,234
I'm a troublemaker!

839
00:27:12,760 --> 00:27:14,030
Gosh, what is that?

840
00:27:14,030 --> 00:27:15,230
(Her cuteness brings chills to people's spines.)

841
00:27:15,230 --> 00:27:16,330
She's acting weird today.

842
00:27:16,330 --> 00:27:17,540
What's wrong with her?

843
00:27:17,540 --> 00:27:18,974
Is she drunk?

844
00:27:19,340 --> 00:27:20,399
I'm a troublemaker!

845
00:27:20,399 --> 00:27:22,310
She must've practiced her dancing too much.

846
00:27:22,310 --> 00:27:24,454
I'm bored, so why don't you two try dating?

847
00:27:25,010 --> 00:27:26,580
Why should we date because you're bored?

848
00:27:26,580 --> 00:27:27,754
About two weeks.

849
00:27:28,409 --> 00:27:29,409
It's not possible since we're a family.

850
00:27:29,409 --> 00:27:31,050
This is supposed to be fun, you know.

851
00:27:31,050 --> 00:27:33,895
Next up, we have Kim Ye Won.

852
00:27:35,350 --> 00:27:38,020
We were introduced to Ye Won...

853
00:27:38,020 --> 00:27:42,290
through her charismatic performance in "Sunny".

854
00:27:42,290 --> 00:27:44,399
So how do you know Kwang Soo?

855
00:27:44,399 --> 00:27:46,129
There was a drama series...

856
00:27:46,129 --> 00:27:48,645
I played a guest role in.

857
00:27:49,030 --> 00:27:50,669
- I played his girlfriend. - Right.

858
00:27:50,669 --> 00:27:52,199
- His girlfriend? - That's right.

859
00:27:52,199 --> 00:27:54,639
It must've been brief, but was anything memorable?

860
00:27:54,639 --> 00:27:55,744
(Without hesitating)

861
00:27:56,669 --> 00:27:57,754
Not really.

862
00:27:58,139 --> 00:28:01,055
- But... - Okay!

863
00:28:01,510 --> 00:28:03,454
So who is Kwang Soo to you?

864
00:28:04,050 --> 00:28:05,050
Someone tall.

865
00:28:05,050 --> 00:28:06,649
(Kwang Soo is just someone who's tall.)

866
00:28:06,649 --> 00:28:08,520
- Someone tall. - That's a good one.

867
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:10,219
- Nice. - This is good.

868
00:28:10,219 --> 00:28:12,219
The interview flows without any hitches.

869
00:28:12,219 --> 00:28:13,919
Nice.

870
00:28:13,919 --> 00:28:16,590
Anyway, I hear that Ye Won...

871
00:28:16,590 --> 00:28:18,504
majored in dancing.

872
00:28:19,230 --> 00:28:20,330
- So... - Really?

873
00:28:20,330 --> 00:28:21,899
So instead of an interview,

874
00:28:21,899 --> 00:28:24,139
we'll watch the performance she has prepared...

875
00:28:24,139 --> 00:28:25,540
for us today.

876
00:28:25,540 --> 00:28:27,469
- A performance? - Even though it's nothing grand...

877
00:28:27,469 --> 00:28:28,740
(Just how good of a dancer is she?)

878
00:28:28,740 --> 00:28:29,845
The music is playing.

879
00:28:32,310 --> 00:28:33,655
It'll only take us a second to assess her.

880
00:28:34,010 --> 00:28:35,655
(My gosh)

881
00:28:39,350 --> 00:28:41,224
Her lines are incredible.

882
00:28:42,050 --> 00:28:43,194
It's so cool.

883
00:28:45,919 --> 00:28:47,320
She really did study dancing.

884
00:28:47,320 --> 00:28:48,389
(Her lines put an end to any doubts they had.)

885
00:28:48,389 --> 00:28:49,629
Her lines prove she trained.

886
00:28:49,629 --> 00:28:51,105
Did she learn Korean dancing?

887
00:28:51,330 --> 00:28:52,859
It's been a while since she quit though.

888
00:28:52,859 --> 00:28:53,934
(She's this good even though she quit a decade ago.)

889
00:28:54,169 --> 00:28:55,605
Did she learn Korean dancing?

890
00:28:56,399 --> 00:28:58,875
(Here come the turns.)

891
00:29:01,209 --> 00:29:02,270
(She spins.)

892
00:29:02,270 --> 00:29:04,514
Look at her spin!

893
00:29:05,040 --> 00:29:06,355
Even on this asphalt...

894
00:29:07,010 --> 00:29:08,379
You look so pretty!

895
00:29:08,379 --> 00:29:10,754
(She manages to land 7 consecutive spins.)

896
00:29:12,949 --> 00:29:15,520
(She then goes the other way while spinning.)

897
00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:17,125
She's adorable.

898
00:29:17,919 --> 00:29:19,689
(She got greedy with her spins...)

899
00:29:19,689 --> 00:29:20,859
(and ended up stumbling.)

900
00:29:20,859 --> 00:29:22,565
That was for real.

901
00:29:23,290 --> 00:29:24,530
(She even showed that she's human too.)

902
00:29:24,530 --> 00:29:25,929
Let's give her a round of applause.

903
00:29:25,929 --> 00:29:27,699
(Still, she managed to prove that she learned to dance.)

904
00:29:27,699 --> 00:29:29,969
We then also have another Ye Won with us.

905
00:29:29,969 --> 00:29:31,944
Please welcome Jang Ye Won.

906
00:29:32,699 --> 00:29:35,840
Do you remember the Flinging Competition...

907
00:29:35,840 --> 00:29:37,585
we had on this show?

908
00:29:38,310 --> 00:29:40,709
She hosted the event for us, remember?

909
00:29:40,709 --> 00:29:42,709
- It was fun. - It's been quite a while.

910
00:29:42,709 --> 00:29:43,709
You're right.

911
00:29:43,709 --> 00:29:45,919
You said back then that you like Kwang Soo.

912
00:29:45,919 --> 00:29:47,520
- That's right. - It was in Bundang.

913
00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:48,520
She said she liked Kwang Soo.

914
00:29:48,520 --> 00:29:50,419
You said you liked Kwang Soo.

915
00:29:50,419 --> 00:29:51,419
Did I?

916
00:29:51,419 --> 00:29:53,365
(Did I?)

917
00:29:53,590 --> 00:29:55,504
- Of course. - That's what you said.

918
00:29:55,629 --> 00:29:56,830
Did I really say that?

919
00:29:56,830 --> 00:29:57,859
- I remember it clearly. - Is that so?

920
00:29:57,859 --> 00:29:59,300
You said you liked him.

921
00:29:59,300 --> 00:30:01,175
It was such a long time ago.

922
00:30:01,369 --> 00:30:04,415
Anyway, we thank Ye Won for being here today.

923
00:30:04,800 --> 00:30:07,709
So now that you've partnered up, I'll explain today's race.

924
00:30:07,709 --> 00:30:10,010
You must unlock the secret to the prophecy...

925
00:30:10,040 --> 00:30:11,040
that contains a request...

926
00:30:11,040 --> 00:30:14,184
forwarded to the deity of light and deity of darkness.

927
00:30:14,209 --> 00:30:17,050
You are humans who serve the deity of light.

928
00:30:17,050 --> 00:30:19,820
Among you are the deity of light, the deity of darkness,

929
00:30:19,820 --> 00:30:20,919
and the prophet.

930
00:30:20,919 --> 00:30:21,919
That sounds complicated.

931
00:30:21,919 --> 00:30:23,764
The deity of light, the deity of darkness, and the prophet.

932
00:30:24,159 --> 00:30:27,234
Let me show you what the prophet left behind.

933
00:30:27,459 --> 00:30:28,889
Sunny's good at these kinds of mysteries.

934
00:30:28,889 --> 00:30:31,060
Can't we keep races like this to once a month?

935
00:30:31,060 --> 00:30:32,335
Maybe you're the deity of light.

936
00:30:32,730 --> 00:30:34,899
I just saw the word "apocalypse."

937
00:30:34,899 --> 00:30:36,204
(From the beginning of time...)

938
00:30:36,429 --> 00:30:38,199
"From the beginning of time, a strong power of darkness..."

939
00:30:38,199 --> 00:30:39,899
"forewarned us of an apocalypse of the human world."

940
00:30:39,899 --> 00:30:41,014
(Narrating)

941
00:30:41,310 --> 00:30:43,570
(Seok Jin is reading the text solemnly when...)

942
00:30:43,570 --> 00:30:45,585
(Jae Seok blocks Seok Jin's view.)

943
00:30:46,280 --> 00:30:47,709
I was reading that.

944
00:30:47,709 --> 00:30:48,780
Well...

945
00:30:48,780 --> 00:30:49,879
I was reading that!

946
00:30:49,879 --> 00:30:51,119
I was getting a close-up shot.

947
00:30:51,119 --> 00:30:52,879
Actually, I was getting one myself.

948
00:30:52,879 --> 00:30:54,125
(It was my close-up shot.)

949
00:30:54,320 --> 00:30:56,189
(Seok Jin has been failing to win a close-up shot for 9 years.)

950
00:30:56,189 --> 00:30:58,560
"The deity of darkness has been tormenting innocent people..."

951
00:30:58,560 --> 00:31:00,619
"and disturbing the world by colluding with evil powers."

952
00:31:00,619 --> 00:31:02,090
(The deity of darkness will become stronger and stronger.)

953
00:31:02,090 --> 00:31:03,605
(However, if you don't give up on light, the world will be saved.)

954
00:31:03,629 --> 00:31:06,230
To find and eliminate the deity of light,

955
00:31:06,230 --> 00:31:08,075
the deity of darkness is disguised as a human.

956
00:31:08,469 --> 00:31:10,770
The deity of light is disguised as a human too...

957
00:31:10,770 --> 00:31:12,944
to eliminate the deity of darkness.

958
00:31:13,469 --> 00:31:15,240
If you help the deity of light eliminate the deity of darkness...

959
00:31:15,240 --> 00:31:17,484
before the deity of light is eliminated,

960
00:31:17,580 --> 00:31:19,184
the deity of light and humans win.

961
00:31:19,439 --> 00:31:22,454
If the deity of darkness eliminates the deity of light first,

962
00:31:22,550 --> 00:31:26,325
the deity of darkness wins alone and receives a prize.

963
00:31:26,619 --> 00:31:31,095
After each mission, the winning team receives a hint.

964
00:31:31,260 --> 00:31:33,590
But if the prophet gets eliminated, hints will stop being distributed.

965
00:31:33,590 --> 00:31:35,530
(Once the prophet gets eliminated, hints will stop being distributed.)

966
00:31:35,560 --> 00:31:37,659
Therefore, it is important for humans...

967
00:31:37,659 --> 00:31:39,659
- to find the prophet. - We have to protect the prophet.

968
00:31:39,659 --> 00:31:40,800
There is a prophet?

969
00:31:40,869 --> 00:31:42,969
There are is a prophet, a deity of darkness, and a deity of light.

970
00:31:42,969 --> 00:31:44,744
After you change into uniforms,

971
00:31:44,840 --> 00:31:46,639
- we'll start the race. - Okay!

972
00:31:46,639 --> 00:31:49,415
(Will the humans manage to drive out the deity of darkness?)

973
00:31:50,510 --> 00:31:51,580
(They start on a mission to get the first hint.)

974
00:31:51,580 --> 00:31:52,784
Here we go.

975
00:31:52,840 --> 00:31:55,209
The first mission that can give you a hint is called...

976
00:31:55,209 --> 00:31:57,649
Telepathy Music Cue.

977
00:31:57,649 --> 00:31:59,719
(Telepathy Music Cue)

978
00:31:59,719 --> 00:32:01,095
Yes!

979
00:32:01,219 --> 00:32:02,619
- "Music Cue"? - In this mission,

980
00:32:02,619 --> 00:32:05,990
men and women will take turns.

981
00:32:06,060 --> 00:32:07,459
When the song plays,

982
00:32:07,459 --> 00:32:09,434
- you have to guess its title. - Okay!

983
00:32:10,260 --> 00:32:12,530
In the first round, women will say the answers.

984
00:32:12,530 --> 00:32:15,474
The male partners have to push the buzzer...

985
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:18,575
to give their female partners a chance to answer.

986
00:32:18,740 --> 00:32:20,740
The female partner...

987
00:32:20,740 --> 00:32:23,169
chooses a time position, and the song will play...

988
00:32:23,169 --> 00:32:24,679
for a second from that position.

989
00:32:24,679 --> 00:32:27,480
She has to say the correct artist name and song title.

990
00:32:27,480 --> 00:32:29,409
If her answer turns out to be correct,

991
00:32:29,409 --> 00:32:32,320
- she will dance to the music. - Dance time!

992
00:32:32,320 --> 00:32:35,050
- Sunny is a great dancer. - I am.

993
00:32:35,119 --> 00:32:38,189
But if someone dances better than the person who said the answer,

994
00:32:38,189 --> 00:32:40,389
- the point will go to that person. - Okay!

995
00:32:40,389 --> 00:32:42,530
- Isn't it unfair to Ye Won? - What do you mean?

996
00:32:42,530 --> 00:32:45,030
(Are we going to dance?)

997
00:32:45,030 --> 00:32:47,034
Her specialty is current affairs.

998
00:32:47,560 --> 00:32:49,230
Can't we do a common knowledge quiz instead?

999
00:32:49,230 --> 00:32:50,530
I might be worse at that.

1000
00:32:50,600 --> 00:32:51,969
- Seoul National University Quiz... - No.

1001
00:32:51,969 --> 00:32:53,840
Didn't you do a knowledge test to get the job?

1002
00:32:53,840 --> 00:32:55,969
I did, but that was a long time ago.

1003
00:32:55,969 --> 00:32:56,969
(She doesn't have so much new knowledge.)

1004
00:32:56,969 --> 00:32:58,909
The men and women's scores will be added up,

1005
00:32:58,909 --> 00:33:01,409
and the top two teams will receive a hint.

1006
00:33:01,480 --> 00:33:04,209
The team in first place will receive a hint about the prophet...

1007
00:33:04,209 --> 00:33:06,855
and a hint about a deity of their choice.

1008
00:33:06,919 --> 00:33:09,050
The team in second place will only receive...

1009
00:33:09,050 --> 00:33:11,335
a hint about a deity of their choice.

1010
00:33:11,820 --> 00:33:13,694
- That's nice. - Ye Won might be the prophet.

1011
00:33:13,919 --> 00:33:15,030
That's right.

1012
00:33:15,030 --> 00:33:16,129
Her name sounds like "prophet".

1013
00:33:16,129 --> 00:33:17,335
- But we have 2 Ye Wons. - We have 2.

1014
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:19,105
They are both...

1015
00:33:19,300 --> 00:33:20,429
- Us two. - What?

1016
00:33:20,500 --> 00:33:21,969
- The prophet. - Their names...

1017
00:33:21,969 --> 00:33:23,145
- There are two Ye Won's. - sound like "prophet".

1018
00:33:23,469 --> 00:33:25,000
(Could one of the two Ye Won's be the prophet?)

1019
00:33:25,070 --> 00:33:26,514
Your reaction was so awkward.

1020
00:33:26,770 --> 00:33:27,969
Sunny just reacted very awkwardly.

1021
00:33:28,040 --> 00:33:30,010
Could Sunny be the deity of light?

1022
00:33:30,010 --> 00:33:31,885
- That was awkward. - Do you have a role?

1023
00:33:31,980 --> 00:33:34,010
- Like the sun? - The sun.

1024
00:33:34,010 --> 00:33:35,655
Kwang means "light" too.

1025
00:33:35,780 --> 00:33:37,350
No. In his name, it means "crazy".

1026
00:33:37,350 --> 00:33:38,580
Does it mean "crazy"?

1027
00:33:38,580 --> 00:33:40,050
(In his name, it means "crazy".)

1028
00:33:40,050 --> 00:33:42,149
- It means "light". - It means "crazy".

1029
00:33:42,149 --> 00:33:44,395
It means "light", not "crazy".

1030
00:33:44,459 --> 00:33:46,060
Who would want their child's name to mean "crazy"?

1031
00:33:46,060 --> 00:33:48,105
(Who would want their child's name to mean "crazy"?)

1032
00:33:48,530 --> 00:33:50,004
That's why I was surprised.

1033
00:33:51,199 --> 00:33:52,305
- Are you mocking my grandpa? - I was shocked.

1034
00:33:52,800 --> 00:33:54,669
It means "crazy" and "excellent".

1035
00:33:54,669 --> 00:33:55,669
(Kwang Soo is excellently crazy.)

1036
00:33:55,669 --> 00:33:57,740
Male members, please step up.

1037
00:33:57,800 --> 00:33:59,240
- Okay. - You're the buzzers.

1038
00:33:59,240 --> 00:34:00,669
(The men will push the buzzer, and the women will say the answer.)

1039
00:34:00,669 --> 00:34:01,885
Ye Won...

1040
00:34:02,209 --> 00:34:04,585
was a radio DJ until recently.

1041
00:34:04,609 --> 00:34:06,939
But I don't know many new songs.

1042
00:34:06,939 --> 00:34:08,850
- You don't know what? - I don't know new songs.

1043
00:34:08,850 --> 00:34:10,085
You should.

1044
00:34:10,149 --> 00:34:11,625
- Okay. - Okay?

1045
00:34:11,919 --> 00:34:13,320
(We can't wait to see their teamwork.)

1046
00:34:13,320 --> 00:34:14,389
- Okay! - Okay!

1047
00:34:14,389 --> 00:34:16,719
All right. I'll play the song for a second...

1048
00:34:16,719 --> 00:34:18,265
- around 1 minute in. - Around 1 minute in.

1049
00:34:18,560 --> 00:34:19,935
It'll play for a second.

1050
00:34:20,420 --> 00:34:21,664
Start...

1051
00:34:22,630 --> 00:34:23,630
Start...

1052
00:34:23,630 --> 00:34:24,929
(Do a good job!)

1053
00:34:24,929 --> 00:34:26,730
(What song will play?)

1054
00:34:26,730 --> 00:34:27,845
the music.

1055
00:34:30,569 --> 00:34:31,745
What?

1056
00:34:32,170 --> 00:34:33,940
(It literally played for a second.)

1057
00:34:33,940 --> 00:34:35,115
That's too short.

1058
00:34:35,270 --> 00:34:36,509
- It's a girl group. - All right.

1059
00:34:36,509 --> 00:34:39,655
To push the buzzer, the male members have to...

1060
00:34:40,339 --> 00:34:41,555
What are we doing?

1061
00:34:41,779 --> 00:34:42,850
rip off a name tag.

1062
00:34:42,850 --> 00:34:44,995
(Rip off a name tag.)

1063
00:34:45,049 --> 00:34:46,354
Gosh!

1064
00:34:47,080 --> 00:34:49,694
(What happened?)

1065
00:34:50,190 --> 00:34:52,135
Okay!

1066
00:34:52,560 --> 00:34:53,560
Rip off a name tag.

1067
00:34:53,560 --> 00:34:55,089
(The name tag is ripped off.)

1068
00:34:55,089 --> 00:34:56,960
(Se Chan rips off Kwang Soo's name tag right away.)

1069
00:34:56,960 --> 00:34:58,104
Okay!

1070
00:34:59,159 --> 00:35:00,475
I expected it.

1071
00:35:01,199 --> 00:35:03,104
Kwang Soo had his back to me.

1072
00:35:03,230 --> 00:35:05,170
You stupid.

1073
00:35:05,170 --> 00:35:06,369
So Min.

1074
00:35:06,369 --> 00:35:07,969
You were amazing, but I don't know this song.

1075
00:35:07,969 --> 00:35:09,314
You do. It's a girl group.

1076
00:35:09,610 --> 00:35:11,339
- So Min. - So Min,

1077
00:35:11,339 --> 00:35:13,185
- choose a time position. - Can I?

1078
00:35:13,739 --> 00:35:16,549
Choose something before or after the previous one.

1079
00:35:16,610 --> 00:35:17,894
Around two minutes in.

1080
00:35:18,480 --> 00:35:20,219
- Can't I tell her the answer? - You can't.

1081
00:35:20,219 --> 00:35:21,650
I'll play it for a second around two minutes in.

1082
00:35:21,719 --> 00:35:23,350
Play the music.

1083
00:35:23,350 --> 00:35:25,464
(The song will play for a second around 2 minutes in.)

1084

1085
00:35:30,230 --> 00:35:32,805
- I have no idea. - How can we know this?

1086
00:35:33,199 --> 00:35:34,944
It literally played for a second.

1087
00:35:35,429 --> 00:35:36,799
It's a song by Girls' Generation.

1088
00:35:36,799 --> 00:35:39,144
(It's a song by Girls' Generation.)

1089
00:35:39,369 --> 00:35:40,469
It's my song?

1090
00:35:40,469 --> 00:35:41,544
(Puzzled)

1091
00:35:42,170 --> 00:35:43,484
"Into the New World".

1092
00:35:44,040 --> 00:35:45,139
That's wrong.

1093
00:35:45,139 --> 00:35:46,580
(Wrong)

1094
00:35:46,580 --> 00:35:48,750
(The men have to do a buzzer mission again.)

1095
00:35:48,750 --> 00:35:49,810
All right.

1096
00:35:49,810 --> 00:35:52,279
For this buzzer...

1097
00:35:52,279 --> 00:35:53,580
(The next buzzer mission is...)

1098
00:35:53,580 --> 00:35:54,650
Rip off a name tag.

1099
00:35:54,650 --> 00:35:55,920
(The next mission is ripping off a name tag again.)

1100
00:35:55,920 --> 00:35:57,095
(Jae Seok grabs Haha's name tag.)

1101
00:35:57,190 --> 00:35:59,460
(Jae Seok is faster than anyone.)

1102
00:35:59,460 --> 00:36:00,659
Yes!

1103
00:36:00,659 --> 00:36:03,259
(Jae Seok rips off a name tag before anyone else.)

1104
00:36:03,259 --> 00:36:04,330
(I did it first!)

1105
00:36:04,330 --> 00:36:05,730
Jae Seok.

1106
00:36:05,730 --> 00:36:07,705
The people next to me are too strong.

1107
00:36:08,929 --> 00:36:10,469
He punched me!

1108
00:36:10,469 --> 00:36:12,615
(He punched me!)

1109
00:36:12,739 --> 00:36:13,770
I didn't!

1110
00:36:13,770 --> 00:36:15,210
He punched me!

1111
00:36:15,210 --> 00:36:16,469
I didn't do that!

1112
00:36:16,469 --> 00:36:17,739
Jong Kook goes too far.

1113
00:36:17,739 --> 00:36:18,940
(He frightens me.)

1114
00:36:18,940 --> 00:36:20,615
(Way to go!)

1115
00:36:21,810 --> 00:36:23,055
Ye Won.

1116
00:36:23,080 --> 00:36:24,254
Choose a time position.

1117
00:36:25,449 --> 00:36:26,650
One second in.

1118
00:36:26,650 --> 00:36:28,350
- No. That's not a good idea. - 50 seconds in?

1119
00:36:28,350 --> 00:36:29,449
- We have to hear the voice. - 50 seconds in?

1120
00:36:29,449 --> 00:36:30,449
- It's over. - One second in.

1121
00:36:30,449 --> 00:36:31,589
- 50 seconds in. - 1 second in.

1122
00:36:31,589 --> 00:36:33,164
- It's 1 second in. - 50 seconds in.

1123
00:36:33,190 --> 00:36:35,305
- 50 seconds in. - I'll play it 1 second in.

1124
00:36:35,460 --> 00:36:36,929
I'll play it for a second one second in.

1125
00:36:36,929 --> 00:36:38,535
Play the music.

1126
00:36:39,659 --> 00:36:42,270
(Obvious)

1127
00:36:42,270 --> 00:36:44,299
(You know what it is, right?)

1128
00:36:44,299 --> 00:36:45,699
You know what it is, right?

1129
00:36:45,699 --> 00:36:47,544
No! You can't tell her!

1130
00:36:47,569 --> 00:36:48,914
You can't tell her!

1131
00:36:49,110 --> 00:36:50,314
Hurry up!

1132
00:36:51,580 --> 00:36:52,885
Rip it off!

1133
00:36:53,279 --> 00:36:55,380
Ye Won. What's your answer?

1134
00:36:55,449 --> 00:36:57,049
Isn't this an old song?

1135
00:36:57,110 --> 00:36:58,354
It's been...

1136
00:36:58,480 --> 00:36:59,725
Ye Won!

1137
00:37:00,219 --> 00:37:01,925
- Countdown! - Five.

1138
00:37:02,389 --> 00:37:03,624
Four.

1139
00:37:03,790 --> 00:37:04,920
Ye Won!

1140
00:37:04,920 --> 00:37:06,194
- Three. - Lee Hyo Lee?

1141
00:37:06,619 --> 00:37:07,659
What?

1142
00:37:07,659 --> 00:37:09,265
"10 Minutes" by Lee Hyo Lee.

1143
00:37:09,290 --> 00:37:10,504
- No. - Is it wrong?

1144
00:37:11,089 --> 00:37:12,435
(Seok Jin thinks it's wrong.)

1145
00:37:12,929 --> 00:37:17,230
(Is it really "10 Minutes" by Lee Hyo Lee?)

1146
00:37:17,230 --> 00:37:19,869
(Jae Seok and Ye Won get it right.)

1147
00:37:19,869 --> 00:37:22,285
(Ye Won did it!)

1148
00:37:23,069 --> 00:37:25,615
- What did you do? - I knew it too.

1149
00:37:25,839 --> 00:37:28,885
(It was a good call to play the song 1 second in.)

1150
00:37:29,650 --> 00:37:32,119
(The intro gave it away.)

1151
00:37:32,119 --> 00:37:34,250
("10 Minutes" by Lee Hyo Lee, with its unique intro,)

1152
00:37:34,250 --> 00:37:36,520
(was a national hit 16 years ago.)

1153
00:37:36,520 --> 00:37:38,860
(It was an easy one for Ye Won,)

1154
00:37:38,860 --> 00:37:41,604
(who knows mostly old songs.)

1155
00:37:42,690 --> 00:37:44,234
It was a good call to play it one second in.

1156
00:37:44,259 --> 00:37:46,234
- Do I need to dance? - Yes, to "10 Minutes".

1157
00:37:46,330 --> 00:37:47,535
Just dance.

1158
00:37:47,560 --> 00:37:48,830
- Don't worry. - I know the dance.

1159
00:37:48,830 --> 00:37:50,270
(You can steal the point by dancing better.)

1160
00:37:50,270 --> 00:37:52,374
(SUNMI joins.)

1161
00:37:53,040 --> 00:37:55,644
(Ye Won and SUNMI dance together.)

1162
00:37:57,839 --> 00:37:59,185
SUNMI, I'm sorry!

1163
00:37:59,739 --> 00:38:00,880
You're better than me.

1164
00:38:00,880 --> 00:38:02,124
- What is SUNMI doing? - SUNMI!

1165
00:38:02,279 --> 00:38:03,754
What is she doing?

1166
00:38:03,949 --> 00:38:05,595
Ye Won knows the dance too.

1167
00:38:06,049 --> 00:38:07,794
- She knows it. - This is correct.

1168
00:38:09,150 --> 00:38:13,089
(The girls who grew up watching Hyo Lee cover her dance.)

1169
00:38:13,089 --> 00:38:15,935
(Even the last part is perfect.)

1170
00:38:16,860 --> 00:38:18,274
SUNMI is so brutal.

1171
00:38:18,730 --> 00:38:20,734
- She's brutal. - She's really brutal.

1172
00:38:21,159 --> 00:38:22,675
Ye Won!

1173
00:38:23,969 --> 00:38:25,139
I knew the dance.

1174
00:38:25,199 --> 00:38:26,869
Sunny, why didn't you dance?

1175
00:38:26,869 --> 00:38:27,869
I don't know it.

1176
00:38:27,869 --> 00:38:29,739
- You don't? - I don't.

1177
00:38:29,739 --> 00:38:31,339
- Do better next time. - Okay!

1178
00:38:31,339 --> 00:38:34,279
- Jae Seok and Ye Won win one point. - Yes!

1179
00:38:34,279 --> 00:38:35,980
(They win 1 point because Ye Won danced as well as SUNMI.)

1180
00:38:35,980 --> 00:38:38,194
This time, the women will do a buzzer mission.

1181
00:38:38,250 --> 00:38:40,619
The men will say the answer. The women will compete.

1182
00:38:40,619 --> 00:38:42,325
Trust me.

1183
00:38:42,489 --> 00:38:44,020
So Min, I know every song.

1184
00:38:44,020 --> 00:38:45,495
(Okay. Let me try.)

1185
00:38:45,589 --> 00:38:47,564
SUNMI, get ready to rip off a name tag.

1186
00:38:47,719 --> 00:38:49,405
- Here we go. - You might rip off a name tag.

1187
00:38:49,529 --> 00:38:50,730
Ji Hyo is really good.

1188
00:38:50,730 --> 00:38:51,929
You shouldn't have stood next to her.

1189
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:53,075
Good.

1190
00:38:53,460 --> 00:38:55,305
The buzzer mission is...

1191
00:38:56,500 --> 00:38:57,500
ripping off a name tag.

1192
00:38:57,500 --> 00:38:58,839
(It's ripping off a name tag again.)

1193
00:38:58,839 --> 00:39:02,084
(Who will get the chance?)

1194
00:39:03,509 --> 00:39:05,040
(Sunny rips off a name tag.)

1195
00:39:05,040 --> 00:39:08,210
(It took her only 1 second.)

1196
00:39:08,210 --> 00:39:09,425
- She ripped it off! - Okay!

1197
00:39:09,610 --> 00:39:12,219
(It's so easy to rip off Ye Won's name tag.)

1198
00:39:12,219 --> 00:39:14,480
Okay! Good job!

1199
00:39:14,480 --> 00:39:15,925
What's with you two?

1200
00:39:16,589 --> 00:39:18,694
Haha.

1201
00:39:18,719 --> 00:39:20,060
The people next to me are too scary.

1202
00:39:20,060 --> 00:39:22,389
(The people next to me are too scary.)

1203
00:39:22,389 --> 00:39:24,429
- They're too scary. - Ye Won...

1204
00:39:24,429 --> 00:39:26,435
Ye Won is so funny.

1205
00:39:26,560 --> 00:39:27,830
She feels so competitive.

1206
00:39:27,830 --> 00:39:29,000
(She feels more competitive than anyone else.)

1207
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:30,504
But in the end, her name tag gets ripped off first.

1208
00:39:30,569 --> 00:39:31,774
She's so bad at games.

1209
00:39:31,969 --> 00:39:34,015
She can't play any games.

1210
00:39:34,170 --> 00:39:36,115
But she's so enthusiastic.

1211
00:39:36,639 --> 00:39:38,380
What should we do?

1212
00:39:38,380 --> 00:39:39,679
Should we play it one second in too?

1213
00:39:39,679 --> 00:39:42,055
- Let's hear the beginning. - They won't get their first one.

1214
00:39:42,110 --> 00:39:44,509
We'll play it one second in too.

1215
00:39:44,509 --> 00:39:45,619
One second in.

1216
00:39:45,619 --> 00:39:47,619
We might hear, "Summer is here!"

1217
00:39:47,619 --> 00:39:49,589
- Right. - You never know.

1218
00:39:49,589 --> 00:39:50,765
Then you can't be wrong.

1219
00:39:50,850 --> 00:39:52,435
I hope it's a song with a super long intro.

1220
00:39:53,420 --> 00:39:55,035
I'll play it for a second one second in.

1221
00:39:55,929 --> 00:39:57,035
Start the music.

1222
00:39:57,330 --> 00:39:59,774
(Obvious)

1223
00:40:01,699 --> 00:40:03,929
(I got it.)

1224
00:40:03,929 --> 00:40:05,914
- I know this one! - SUNMI!

1225
00:40:06,040 --> 00:40:07,100
- SUNMI! - I know it!

1226
00:40:07,100 --> 00:40:09,245
I know it!

1227
00:40:09,310 --> 00:40:12,210
(Only Jong Kook can say the answer.)

1228
00:40:12,210 --> 00:40:13,480
Be quiet.

1229
00:40:13,480 --> 00:40:15,984
- Countdown! - I know the answer.

1230
00:40:16,080 --> 00:40:18,055
It's a song by Brown Eyed Girls.

1231
00:40:18,179 --> 00:40:19,420
"Abracadabra".

1232
00:40:19,420 --> 00:40:23,949
("Abracadabra" by Brown Eyed Girls)

1233
00:40:23,949 --> 00:40:25,860
(Is it correct?)

1234
00:40:25,860 --> 00:40:27,135
It's correct.

1235
00:40:27,960 --> 00:40:29,464
Okay!

1236
00:40:30,130 --> 00:40:32,230
It has to be played one second in.

1237
00:40:32,230 --> 00:40:33,734
It's definitely one second in.

1238
00:40:33,799 --> 00:40:35,175
(It was a good strategy.)

1239
00:40:36,130 --> 00:40:38,299
(The intro is hard to miss.)

1240
00:40:38,299 --> 00:40:42,984
("Abracadabra", a hit from 10 years ago, has a catchy beat.)

1241
00:40:43,569 --> 00:40:45,339
(The Arrogant Dance swept the country.)

1242
00:40:45,339 --> 00:40:47,084
(The song starts with an unforgettable intro.)

1243
00:40:47,380 --> 00:40:49,955
(Dance time follows.)

1244
00:40:50,980 --> 00:40:54,095
- She doesn't disappoint. - Seriously.

1245
00:40:54,150 --> 00:40:56,690
- She doesn't disappoint. - I know.

1246
00:40:56,690 --> 00:40:58,095
(Her dance is perfect.)

1247
00:40:58,460 --> 00:41:00,234
- She is an idol singer. - She is good.

1248
00:41:00,460 --> 00:41:02,004
She is an idol singer.

1249
00:41:02,259 --> 00:41:03,330
(Her Arrogant Dance is unrivaled.)

1250
00:41:03,330 --> 00:41:06,234
- She is good. She is good. - That's great.

1251
00:41:07,699 --> 00:41:10,069
(We have to do something.)

1252
00:41:10,069 --> 00:41:11,639
- There we go. - Come on.

1253
00:41:11,639 --> 00:41:13,414
- There we go. - Who dances like that?

1254
00:41:13,900 --> 00:41:16,544
(The two sexy dancers)

1255
00:41:17,310 --> 00:41:18,814
Who dances like that?

1256
00:41:19,380 --> 00:41:20,409
They are good.

1257
00:41:20,409 --> 00:41:21,825
- What is that? - What are you doing?

1258
00:41:22,279 --> 00:41:23,549
- What are you doing? - This isn't a part of the dance.

1259
00:41:23,549 --> 00:41:24,725
Look at So Min!

1260
00:41:26,850 --> 00:41:29,024
(Upset)

1261
00:41:30,020 --> 00:41:32,794
(The scene-stealer appears.)

1262
00:41:34,020 --> 00:41:35,290
(What is that?)

1263
00:41:35,290 --> 00:41:36,905
What are you doing?

1264
00:41:37,159 --> 00:41:38,699
(Sexy)

1265
00:41:38,699 --> 00:41:40,175
Go back to your spot.

1266
00:41:40,560 --> 00:41:42,230
What are you doing?

1267
00:41:42,230 --> 00:41:44,130
- You aren't sexy. - What are you doing?

1268
00:41:44,130 --> 00:41:45,600
- You aren't sexy. - Does your neck hurt?

1269
00:41:45,600 --> 00:41:46,774
Go back to your spot.

1270
00:41:46,799 --> 00:41:48,314
She is pretending to be sexy.

1271
00:41:48,339 --> 00:41:49,770
- What is her problem? - Go back to your spot.

1272
00:41:49,770 --> 00:41:50,914
Why does she...

1273
00:41:51,440 --> 00:41:53,615
Why does she keep tousling her hair?

1274
00:41:53,639 --> 00:41:55,080
She is the worst.

1275
00:41:55,150 --> 00:41:57,584
I get everything else,

1276
00:41:57,679 --> 00:41:59,995
but why does So Min keep tousling her hair?

1277
00:42:00,020 --> 00:42:01,790
She also put her hand on her neck and bit her lips.

1278
00:42:01,790 --> 00:42:02,790
(Seeing her bite her lips was worse.)

1279
00:42:02,790 --> 00:42:04,650
Why does she keep doing that?

1280
00:42:04,650 --> 00:42:06,759
- Why does she keep doing that? - I did it to look sexy.

1281
00:42:06,759 --> 00:42:08,730
- For goodness' sake. - She pretended to be sexy.

1282
00:42:08,730 --> 00:42:10,535
For goodness' sake.

1283
00:42:10,690 --> 00:42:12,504
I approve of Sunny's dance. The team gets a point.

1284
00:42:12,699 --> 00:42:14,834
She is an idol singer.

1285
00:42:14,900 --> 00:42:16,429
She is an idol singer.

1286
00:42:16,429 --> 00:42:18,029
- You know, - She is the best idol singer.

1287
00:42:18,029 --> 00:42:19,544
I forgot about it.

1288
00:42:20,500 --> 00:42:22,644
She is good. Everyone can dance well.

1289
00:42:22,810 --> 00:42:26,940
This time, you need to use your brain.

1290
00:42:26,940 --> 00:42:28,080
It's the women's turn.

1291
00:42:28,080 --> 00:42:29,555
- I am in trouble. - Brain.

1292
00:42:30,110 --> 00:42:31,484
Who is the brainy one?

1293
00:42:32,279 --> 00:42:33,819
This is your last chance.

1294
00:42:33,819 --> 00:42:35,495
- It's the women's buzzer mission. - Ye Won, let's do this.

1295
00:42:36,020 --> 00:42:39,290
This time, the buzzer mission is the random three-line poem.

1296
00:42:39,290 --> 00:42:43,489
(The random three-line poem)

1297
00:42:43,489 --> 00:42:45,460
Your poem needs to make sense.

1298
00:42:45,460 --> 00:42:46,604
I am sorry,

1299
00:42:46,860 --> 00:42:51,444
but can't you give us a mission that requires knowledge, not wits?

1300
00:42:52,569 --> 00:42:53,569
Let's go.

1301
00:42:53,569 --> 00:42:55,115
Let's start with So Min.

1302
00:42:55,409 --> 00:42:56,540
I am nervous.

1303
00:42:56,540 --> 00:43:00,779
Get ready. Set, go.

1304
00:43:00,779 --> 00:43:02,850
(Topic: Cat)

1305
00:43:02,850 --> 00:43:06,655
Don't tell on me. Okay, Se Chan?

1306
00:43:06,719 --> 00:43:07,955
Meow!

1307
00:43:08,850 --> 00:43:12,119
(Don't tell on me. Okay, Se Chan? Meow!)

1308
00:43:12,119 --> 00:43:13,790
- What was that? - Nice!

1309
00:43:13,790 --> 00:43:14,964
- Why? - Why?

1310
00:43:15,889 --> 00:43:17,889
- Nice! Why? - Why?

1311
00:43:17,889 --> 00:43:19,705
"Don't tell on me. Okay, Se Chan? Meow!"

1312
00:43:19,759 --> 00:43:22,929
Why did she act cute for no reason?

1313
00:43:22,929 --> 00:43:24,400
- It made no sense. - Why do you say that?

1314
00:43:24,400 --> 00:43:26,944
- It's Ye Won's turn. - Why? Why was that unacceptable?

1315
00:43:27,199 --> 00:43:28,310
That was totally unacceptable.

1316
00:43:28,310 --> 00:43:29,670
(Ye Won goes next.)

1317
00:43:29,670 --> 00:43:30,845
Get ready.

1318
00:43:31,509 --> 00:43:33,279
Set, go.

1319
00:43:33,279 --> 00:43:34,984
(Topic: Jee Seok Jin)

1320
00:43:35,380 --> 00:43:36,624
He is past it.

1321
00:43:37,150 --> 00:43:40,425
Seok Jin is already past it.

1322
00:43:41,719 --> 00:43:42,894
I am serious.

1323
00:43:44,920 --> 00:43:46,060
(I am serious.)

1324
00:43:46,060 --> 00:43:48,429
- What does that even mean? - It works.

1325
00:43:48,429 --> 00:43:49,460
It works.

1326
00:43:49,460 --> 00:43:51,029
- Whatever it is, he is past it. - You should have explained further.

1327
00:43:51,029 --> 00:43:52,905
- What does it mean? - It makes sense, but...

1328
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:54,604
- In any case, he is past it. - Are you a doctor?

1329
00:43:54,799 --> 00:43:57,000
- In any case, he is past it. - Are you a doctor?

1330
00:43:57,000 --> 00:43:58,569
- It doesn't matter. - What does it mean?

1331
00:43:58,569 --> 00:43:59,600
It doesn't matter.

1332
00:43:59,600 --> 00:44:02,115
- Seok Jin must be annoyed. - It feels strange.

1333
00:44:02,210 --> 00:44:03,414
Good job.

1334
00:44:03,909 --> 00:44:04,980
Get ready.

1335
00:44:04,980 --> 00:44:06,880
Ji Hyo, let's go.

1336
00:44:06,880 --> 00:44:08,015
Say whatever comes to your mind.

1337
00:44:08,110 --> 00:44:10,350
- It just needs to make sense. - It just needs to make sense.

1338
00:44:10,350 --> 00:44:11,584
- It just needs to make sense. - Let's go.

1339
00:44:11,679 --> 00:44:15,389
Get ready. Set, go.

1340
00:44:15,389 --> 00:44:16,389
(Topic: Slang)

1341
00:44:16,389 --> 00:44:20,064
Hey! Dude! Hey!

1342
00:44:20,920 --> 00:44:24,029
(It's like a scene from a famous movie.)

1343
00:44:24,029 --> 00:44:26,334
What was that?

1344
00:44:26,730 --> 00:44:28,299
- What? - What was that?

1345
00:44:28,299 --> 00:44:29,900
- It works. - It makes sense!

1346
00:44:29,900 --> 00:44:32,144
- Hey! Dude! - Hey!

1347
00:44:32,670 --> 00:44:33,814
She is funny.

1348
00:44:34,270 --> 00:44:36,170
- Today, - She is witty.

1349
00:44:36,170 --> 00:44:38,084
Ji Hyo is witty.

1350
00:44:38,679 --> 00:44:41,414
Hey! Hey!

1351
00:44:41,710 --> 00:44:44,449
- Ye Won is extremely nervous. - Ye Won.

1352
00:44:44,449 --> 00:44:47,150
The competition rate for the anchor audition...

1353
00:44:47,150 --> 00:44:48,694
was 5,000 to 1, right?

1354
00:44:48,819 --> 00:44:51,190
- It was 3,800 to 2. - 3,800 to 2.

1355
00:44:51,250 --> 00:44:53,234
That's what she overcame to become an anchor.

1356
00:44:53,290 --> 00:44:54,290
She is impressive.

1357
00:44:54,290 --> 00:44:55,635
- Let's go. - Let's go.

1358
00:44:55,690 --> 00:44:58,035
- In 1, 2, - Focus. Focus.

1359
00:44:58,799 --> 00:44:59,905
three.

1360
00:45:00,100 --> 00:45:02,245
It's a squid. How disgusting! My goodness!

1361
00:45:04,799 --> 00:45:07,239
(She created perfect sentences about squid.)

1362
00:45:07,239 --> 00:45:09,239
(That was incredible!)

1363
00:45:09,239 --> 00:45:10,845
I didn't expect that.

1364
00:45:10,940 --> 00:45:13,540
- I didn't expect that. - I can't help but approve.

1365
00:45:13,540 --> 00:45:16,425
Although it wasn't funny, it made sense.

1366
00:45:16,610 --> 00:45:18,880
- Ye Won is the winner. - She is good at this.

1367
00:45:18,880 --> 00:45:20,420
- It was so clean. - It was nice.

1368
00:45:20,420 --> 00:45:21,595
Now, pick the time.

1369
00:45:21,920 --> 00:45:23,889
- What? - Was that the mission?

1370
00:45:23,889 --> 00:45:25,989
- Was that the mission? - That's right.

1371
00:45:25,989 --> 00:45:27,920
- Come on! - That was the mission.

1372
00:45:27,920 --> 00:45:28,929
The winner gets to pick the time.

1373
00:45:28,929 --> 00:45:30,259
(Everyone forgot that this was just a buzzer mission.)

1374
00:45:30,259 --> 00:45:31,860
Ye Won, pick the time.

1375
00:45:31,860 --> 00:45:33,035
I pick...

1376
00:45:33,730 --> 00:45:35,444
- 2 seconds. - 2 seconds.

1377
00:45:35,600 --> 00:45:39,144
1 second from 2 seconds in. Play the music.

1378
00:45:39,969 --> 00:45:44,385
(It's a crucial hint.)

1379
00:45:44,839 --> 00:45:47,009
- Let me answer! - You can't answer.

1380
00:45:47,009 --> 00:45:48,524
- Me! - That was crucial.

1381
00:45:48,580 --> 00:45:50,580
Red Velvet's "Red Flavor".

1382
00:45:50,580 --> 00:45:53,020
(I know the answer.)

1383
00:45:53,020 --> 00:45:55,055
(It's correct.)

1384
00:45:56,020 --> 00:45:59,460
("Red Flavor" starts with the title of the song.)

1385
00:45:59,460 --> 00:46:01,164
(It's correct.)

1386
00:46:01,460 --> 00:46:03,489
(We got it right!)

1387
00:46:03,489 --> 00:46:04,734
It's a good idea to pick the beginning.

1388
00:46:04,929 --> 00:46:07,004
So Min, I know all the songs.

1389
00:46:07,360 --> 00:46:08,975
I know all the songs. Just give me a chance to answer.

1390
00:46:09,830 --> 00:46:12,270
Hold on. I will give you a chance.

1391
00:46:12,270 --> 00:46:15,739
This buzzer mission is a bit unusual.

1392
00:46:15,739 --> 00:46:18,580
(What's the buzzer mission for the female members?)

1393
00:46:18,580 --> 00:46:20,739
Steal a shoe from a male member who isn't your partner.

1394
00:46:20,739 --> 00:46:23,210
(Steal a shoe from a male member who isn't your partner.)

1395
00:46:23,210 --> 00:46:24,279
Hurry up.

1396
00:46:24,279 --> 00:46:26,394

1397
00:46:27,150 --> 00:46:29,089

1398
00:46:29,089 --> 00:46:30,725
(Come here!)

1399
00:46:32,060 --> 00:46:33,659
(I will run that way.)

1401
00:46:35,460 --> 00:46:37,259
(and switches her target to Jae Seok.)

1402
00:46:37,259 --> 00:46:38,905
(They aim for a shoe each.)

1403
00:46:39,630 --> 00:46:40,874
Come on.

1404
00:46:41,560 --> 00:46:42,845

1406
00:46:45,199 --> 00:46:46,299
I got it!

(Sunny succeeded to steal Kwang Soo's shoe.)

1408
00:46:49,170 --> 00:46:50,385
It's over.

1409
00:46:50,469 --> 00:46:52,484
Please stop these women.

1410
00:46:53,440 --> 00:46:54,540
For goodness' sake.

1411
00:46:54,540 --> 00:46:55,679
My goodness.

1412
00:46:55,679 --> 00:46:58,124
Please stop Ye Won and Ji Hyo.

1413
00:46:58,150 --> 00:47:01,194
They didn't let go even when the mission was over.

1414
00:47:01,449 --> 00:47:03,619
(Ye Won tries hard but fails most of the times.)

1415
00:47:03,619 --> 00:47:05,535
Sunny is really good at this.

1416
00:47:05,860 --> 00:47:08,119
- Sunny is so enthusiastic. - The others didn't stand a chance.

1417
00:47:08,119 --> 00:47:09,529
She is so strong.

1418
00:47:09,529 --> 00:47:11,529
Ye Won, do something!

1419
00:47:11,529 --> 00:47:13,100
- I tried hard! - 3 or 4 seconds?

1420
00:47:13,100 --> 00:47:14,635
3 or 4 seconds?

1421
00:47:14,759 --> 00:47:16,830
- Let's go. - 3 or 4 seconds? 3 seconds?

1422
00:47:16,830 --> 00:47:19,469
- Okay. 3 seconds, please. - 1 second from 3 seconds in.

1423
00:47:19,469 --> 00:47:20,540
All right.

1424
00:47:20,540 --> 00:47:22,814
Music, cue.

1425
00:47:23,110 --> 00:47:25,285
(This time, they hear a breathing sound.)

1426
00:47:25,679 --> 00:47:27,610
(A breathing sound?)

1427
00:47:27,610 --> 00:47:28,725
Hey.

1428
00:47:29,580 --> 00:47:31,385
- You know this one, right? - I know this one!

1429
00:47:32,549 --> 00:47:34,455
I know this one. Get me this chance.

1430
00:47:34,480 --> 00:47:35,819
- I know this one. - Okay.

1431
00:47:35,819 --> 00:47:38,420
- I know this one. - In 5, 4...

1432
00:47:38,420 --> 00:47:39,759
"Coming-of-Age Ceremony" by Park Ji Yoon.

1433
00:47:39,759 --> 00:47:41,830
(It's "Coming-of-Age Ceremony" by Park Ji Yoon.)

1434
00:47:41,830 --> 00:47:43,664
He is correct.

1435
00:47:43,730 --> 00:47:45,874
If you dance well, you could steal the answer.

1436
00:47:45,929 --> 00:47:48,130
Okay. Okay.

1437
00:47:48,130 --> 00:47:49,705
- What was the dance? - So Min, do something.

1438
00:47:50,280 --> 00:47:51,680
Participate if you know the dance.

1439
00:47:51,680 --> 00:47:53,050
("Coming-of-Age Ceremony" plays.)

1440
00:47:53,050 --> 00:47:54,319
That's it, So Min. Dance!

1441
00:47:54,319 --> 00:47:55,437
That's perfect.

1442
00:47:55,437 --> 00:47:55,980
Participate if you know the dance.

1443
00:47:55,980 --> 00:47:57,350
("Coming-of-Age Ceremony" plays.)

1444
00:47:57,350 --> 00:47:58,619
That's it, So Min. Dance!

1445
00:47:58,619 --> 00:48:01,119
- That's perfect. - Good job!

1446
00:48:01,119 --> 00:48:03,834
(It's the last chance to steal a point.)

1447
00:48:04,489 --> 00:48:06,604
(I won't let anyone take my point.)

1448
00:48:07,100 --> 00:48:08,435
They are good.

1449
00:48:08,860 --> 00:48:10,044
They are good.

1450
00:48:10,600 --> 00:48:12,869
(Everyone enters the stage.)

1451
00:48:12,869 --> 00:48:14,214
(The stage is full.)

1452
00:48:15,440 --> 00:48:17,785
(She is cheerful all by herself.)

1453
00:48:18,210 --> 00:48:19,914
- My goodness. - No, no.

1454
00:48:19,940 --> 00:48:21,179
Jump in. Jump in.

1455
00:48:21,179 --> 00:48:22,480
Ye Won, what are you doing?

1456
00:48:22,480 --> 00:48:24,024
- Hurry up and jump in. - There you go.

1457
00:48:24,179 --> 00:48:25,325
- There you go. - Come on.

1458
00:48:26,049 --> 00:48:27,894
- What should I do? - Do this.

1459
00:48:28,080 --> 00:48:30,294
(I don't know what I am doing.)

1460
00:48:30,850 --> 00:48:32,694
So Min, go back to your spot.

1461
00:48:32,920 --> 00:48:34,365
So Min, go back to your spot.

1462
00:48:34,989 --> 00:48:36,164
SUNMI, dance over there.

1463
00:48:36,460 --> 00:48:37,589
Dance over there.

1464
00:48:37,589 --> 00:48:38,805
Dance in front of the camera.

1465
00:48:38,860 --> 00:48:40,199
So Min, go back to your spot.

1466
00:48:40,199 --> 00:48:43,004
(The dancing queen got a hold of a camera.)

1467
00:48:43,299 --> 00:48:45,504
So Min. So Min.

1468
00:48:45,600 --> 00:48:46,914
So Min, go back to your spot.

1469
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:49,069
(Everyone tries hard...)

1470
00:48:49,069 --> 00:48:51,339
(to show a sexy dance.)

1471
00:48:51,339 --> 00:48:54,155
Gosh, So Min is so funny.

1472
00:48:54,339 --> 00:48:55,615
Ye Won, you are doing great.

1473
00:48:55,940 --> 00:48:57,524
Ye Won, you are doing great.

1474
00:48:57,549 --> 00:49:00,024
(It's a complete mess.)

1475
00:49:00,480 --> 00:49:01,880
All right, Ye Won.

1476
00:49:01,880 --> 00:49:03,949
(I am no longer So Min.)

1477
00:49:03,949 --> 00:49:06,095
(Creaking)

1478
00:49:06,420 --> 00:49:07,520
So Min!

1479
00:49:07,520 --> 00:49:10,429
(Next to the dancing zombie)

1480
00:49:10,429 --> 00:49:12,535
- You are doing great. - You are doing great.

1481
00:49:12,659 --> 00:49:14,104
You are doing great.

1482
00:49:14,730 --> 00:49:16,205
Ji Hyo, go back to your spot.

1483
00:49:16,529 --> 00:49:17,929
Ji Hyo, go back to your spot.

1484
00:49:17,929 --> 00:49:19,940
(I close my eyes now)

1485
00:49:19,940 --> 00:49:21,739
- Go back to your spot. - Go back to your spot.

1486
00:49:21,739 --> 00:49:23,770
(The last shot is mine.)

1487
00:49:23,770 --> 00:49:24,984
Go back to your spot.

1488
00:49:25,940 --> 00:49:27,214
Good job.

1489
00:49:27,909 --> 00:49:29,139
You did a good job.

1490
00:49:29,139 --> 00:49:31,110
- You did a good job. - No one looked at me.

1491
00:49:31,110 --> 00:49:34,279
No one was exceptionally good.

1492
00:49:34,279 --> 00:49:36,080
They were about the same level.

1493
00:49:36,080 --> 00:49:37,995
- They were about the same level. - So Min grabbed her neck.

1494
00:49:38,219 --> 00:49:40,319
- She got the last shot. - Come on.

1495
00:49:40,319 --> 00:49:41,659
So Min was imitating a zombie.

1496
00:49:41,659 --> 00:49:42,719
(Was she infected with the sexy virus?)

1497
00:49:42,719 --> 00:49:44,029
Jang Ye Won.

1498
00:49:44,060 --> 00:49:47,299
Jang Ye Won was like a thug.

1499
00:49:47,299 --> 00:49:49,100
She danced like a middle-aged man.

1500
00:49:49,100 --> 00:49:50,830
She danced very differently.

1501
00:49:50,830 --> 00:49:53,540
Kim Ye Won did the entire dance routine.

1502
00:49:53,540 --> 00:49:55,170
I knew the dance routine.

1503
00:49:55,170 --> 00:49:56,909
- SUNMI danced at the end... - No one was exceptionally good.

1504
00:49:56,909 --> 00:49:59,110
because there was no space. The cameraman...

1505
00:49:59,110 --> 00:50:01,839
Ouch! Why did you step on my foot?

1506
00:50:01,839 --> 00:50:03,185
(Stepping)

1507
00:50:03,279 --> 00:50:04,980
(Ouch! Why did you step on my foot?)

1508
00:50:04,980 --> 00:50:06,179
- Why? - What?

1509
00:50:06,179 --> 00:50:07,719
- What? - I didn't do anything.

1510
00:50:07,719 --> 00:50:09,589
- Who stepped on my foot? - I didn't do anything.

1511
00:50:09,619 --> 00:50:10,790
Who stepped on your foot?

1512
00:50:10,790 --> 00:50:12,394
Everyone...

1513
00:50:12,589 --> 00:50:14,690
except for two people danced well.

1514
00:50:14,690 --> 00:50:16,730
(He didn't give any names.)

1515
00:50:16,730 --> 00:50:19,259
Seriously, the two of them were the worst.

1516
00:50:19,259 --> 00:50:21,799
There should be a mission for Jang Ye Won!

1517
00:50:21,799 --> 00:50:23,170
Jang Ye Won is expectant.

1518
00:50:23,170 --> 00:50:25,900
Since everyone was about the same level,

1519
00:50:25,900 --> 00:50:28,400
- Sunny will get a point. - Okay!

1520
00:50:28,400 --> 00:50:31,369
(In the end, Sunny gets a point!)

1521
00:50:31,369 --> 00:50:32,444
Sunny.

1522
00:50:33,080 --> 00:50:34,210
Sunny is too good.

1523
00:50:34,210 --> 00:50:35,839
- Sunny is good. - She is good at games.

1524
00:50:35,839 --> 00:50:36,850
She is so good.

1525
00:50:36,850 --> 00:50:39,719
- You can't ignore her experience. - Seriously.

1526
00:50:39,719 --> 00:50:41,920
You can't ignore her experience.

1527
00:50:41,920 --> 00:50:45,089
With this, Team Jong Kook and Sunny takes...

1528
00:50:45,089 --> 00:50:46,664
- first place. - Okay!

1529
00:50:47,889 --> 00:50:50,659
Jong Kook and Sunny,

1530
00:50:50,659 --> 00:50:52,360
please come forward.

1531
00:50:52,360 --> 00:50:55,029
- Okay. - Sunny is really good.

1532
00:50:55,100 --> 00:50:57,699
Sunny is either a lucky one or a member with a role.

1533
00:50:57,699 --> 00:50:58,944
- It's 1 of the 2. - That's not true.

1534
00:50:59,670 --> 00:51:01,100
- I only played the game diligently. - You will get...

1535
00:51:01,100 --> 00:51:03,144
a hint of the prophet for free.

1536
00:51:03,210 --> 00:51:04,409
Thank you.

1537
00:51:04,409 --> 00:51:05,914
One of them could be the prophet.

1538
00:51:07,409 --> 00:51:08,555
This is...

1539
00:51:08,909 --> 00:51:09,909
What is this?

1540
00:51:09,909 --> 00:51:10,984
(Which hint did they receive on the prophet?)

1541
00:51:11,310 --> 00:51:12,779
(Prophet)

1542
00:51:12,779 --> 00:51:17,464
(The prophet isn't in his or her 50s.)

1543
00:51:17,690 --> 00:51:18,819
What is this?

1544
00:51:18,819 --> 00:51:21,190
- The first hint is like this. - What is this?

1545
00:51:21,190 --> 00:51:22,435
I guess it's broad.

1546
00:51:22,619 --> 00:51:23,659
All right.

1547
00:51:23,659 --> 00:51:24,989
(The hint isn't enough to narrow down the candidates.)

1548
00:51:24,989 --> 00:51:27,000
You will now receive a hint...

1549
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:29,535
on either the deity of light or the deity of darkness.

1550
00:51:29,699 --> 00:51:31,929
If your choices are the same,

1551
00:51:31,929 --> 00:51:34,900
you will get a hint on the deity of darkness.

1552
00:51:34,900 --> 00:51:37,040
If your choices are different, you will get a hint...

1553
00:51:37,040 --> 00:51:38,170
on the deity of light.

1554
00:51:38,170 --> 00:51:40,810
If one of them is the deity of darkness,

1555
00:51:40,810 --> 00:51:42,110
- their choices will be different. - That's right.

1556
00:51:42,110 --> 00:51:44,254
If she is the deity of darkness,

1557
00:51:44,380 --> 00:51:45,710
she would want a hint on the deity of light.

1558
00:51:45,710 --> 00:51:47,150
That would be too obvious.

1559
00:51:47,150 --> 00:51:49,449
They might have no choice but to choose the deity of darkness.

1560
00:51:49,449 --> 00:51:51,089
But this is the first hint.

1561
00:51:51,089 --> 00:51:52,619
I will choose what you want.

1562
00:51:52,619 --> 00:51:53,865
(What they choose could be a hint in and of itself.)

1563
00:51:54,259 --> 00:51:55,659
You played the game diligently. Choose what you want.

1564
00:51:55,659 --> 00:51:56,834
- Really? - Yes.

1565
00:51:56,929 --> 00:51:59,560
Light or darkness? In 1, 2, 3.

1566
00:51:59,560 --> 00:52:01,830
- Darkness. - Darkness.

1567
00:52:01,830 --> 00:52:04,170
(They will get a hint on the deity of darkness.)

1568
00:52:04,170 --> 00:52:07,270
It's strange. You usually choose in secret.

1569
00:52:07,270 --> 00:52:08,639
Today, we had to reveal our choices.

1570
00:52:08,639 --> 00:52:09,839
It's strange.

1571
00:52:09,839 --> 00:52:12,644
(Jong Kook and Sunny check the hint while everyone is watching.)

1572
00:52:12,969 --> 00:52:15,540
(The deity of darkness debuted over 10 years ago.)

1573
00:52:15,540 --> 00:52:17,080
(Deity of darkness)

1574
00:52:17,080 --> 00:52:21,854
(The hint eliminates Jang Ye Won.)

1575
00:52:22,150 --> 00:52:23,920
I see.

1576
00:52:23,920 --> 00:52:25,150
This helps.

1577
00:52:25,150 --> 00:52:27,089
Is the hint broad or not?

1578
00:52:27,089 --> 00:52:28,619
(Is the hint broad or not?)

1579
00:52:28,619 --> 00:52:30,190
If you want to know, place first.

1580
00:52:30,190 --> 00:52:31,190
My goodness.

1581
00:52:31,190 --> 00:52:32,190
(If you want to know, place first.)

1582
00:52:32,190 --> 00:52:34,600
That's right. I was going to say the same thing.

1583
00:52:34,600 --> 00:52:36,369
All right.

1584
00:52:36,369 --> 00:52:37,475
Good job, Sunny.

1585
00:52:37,730 --> 00:52:38,830
The team that placed second, please come forward.

1586
00:52:38,830 --> 00:52:39,839
- Darkness. - Darkness.

1587
00:52:39,839 --> 00:52:41,040
Since your choices are the same,

1588
00:52:41,040 --> 00:52:43,710
you will get a hint on the deity of darkness.

1589
00:52:43,710 --> 00:52:45,345
(Haha and Ye Won get a hint on the deity of darkness.)

1590
00:52:46,210 --> 00:52:49,615
I don't understand why they are getting a hint as well.

1591
00:52:49,810 --> 00:52:51,555
(Jang Ye Won isn't the deity of darkness.)

1592
00:52:51,880 --> 00:52:53,179
- I guess the hint is telling. - Okay.

1593
00:52:53,179 --> 00:52:54,250
Okay.

1594
00:52:54,250 --> 00:52:56,150
You are hungry, right?

1595
00:52:56,150 --> 00:52:57,150
- Yes. - Yes.

1596
00:52:57,150 --> 00:52:59,389
You will split into two vehicles and move to the restaurant.

1597
00:52:59,389 --> 00:53:00,690
Two vehicles?

1598
00:53:00,690 --> 00:53:01,690
It must be first-come, first-served.

1599
00:53:01,690 --> 00:53:04,989
Six people or three couples can fit into each vehicle.

1600
00:53:04,989 --> 00:53:06,830
- Okay. - The vehicles will give a hint...

1601
00:53:06,830 --> 00:53:11,000
on either the deity of light or the deity of darkness.

1602
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:15,374
(A hint on either the deity of light or the deity of darkness)

1603
00:53:17,339 --> 00:53:20,080
Thus, board the vehicle of your choice.

1604
00:53:20,080 --> 00:53:21,940
Now, let's go.

1605
00:53:21,940 --> 00:53:23,179
- Okay. - SUNMI, hurry up.

1606
00:53:23,179 --> 00:53:24,750
- Which vehicle should we choose? - Let's go.

1607
00:53:24,750 --> 00:53:26,279
Which vehicle should we choose? Ye Won, come here.

1608
00:53:26,279 --> 00:53:27,279
- The deity of darkness. - Jae Seok!

1609
00:53:27,279 --> 00:53:28,650
Ye Won, hurry up. The deity of darkness.

1610
00:53:28,650 --> 00:53:29,679
Jae Seok!

1611
00:53:29,679 --> 00:53:31,250
(Most members want a hint on the deity of darkness.)

1612
00:53:31,250 --> 00:53:32,650
- SUNMI! - So Min!

1613
00:53:32,650 --> 00:53:34,589
We did it. We did it.

1614
00:53:34,589 --> 00:53:35,889
- Hurry up. - So Min.

1615
00:53:35,889 --> 00:53:36,929
Hurry up.

1616
00:53:36,929 --> 00:53:38,690
- Ji Hyo. - My goodness.

1617
00:53:38,690 --> 00:53:39,929
Hurry up, Ji Hyo.

1618
00:53:39,929 --> 00:53:42,100
- So Min, come here. - Hurry up, Ji Hyo.

1619
00:53:42,100 --> 00:53:44,500
(Only one more team can board the vehicle.)

1620
00:53:44,500 --> 00:53:46,469
- Ji Hyo. - There is no seat belt.

1621
00:53:46,469 --> 00:53:47,544
Hurry up.

1622
00:53:47,799 --> 00:53:49,199
- There is no seat belt. - Jae Seok.

1623
00:53:49,199 --> 00:53:51,239
How did we come here in second?

1624
00:53:51,310 --> 00:53:52,670
- What is going on? - The deity of light.

1625
00:53:52,670 --> 00:53:54,009
The vehicle for a hint on the deity of darkness is full.

1626
00:53:54,009 --> 00:53:55,584
- My goodness. - It's full.

1627
00:53:56,310 --> 00:53:57,785
You are happy, right?

1628
00:53:57,810 --> 00:53:58,810
Happy?

1629
00:53:58,810 --> 00:54:00,380
- I know you are happy. - That's not true.

1630
00:54:00,380 --> 00:54:02,719
- Those on the other vehicle... - They are suspicious.

1631
00:54:02,719 --> 00:54:03,989
- are suspicious. - The deity of darkness is there.

1632
00:54:03,989 --> 00:54:06,095
Why didn't they try to come to this vehicle?

1633
00:54:06,290 --> 00:54:08,060
There are three teams in each vehicle, right?

1634
00:54:08,060 --> 00:54:09,520
(Is the deity of darkness...)

1635
00:54:09,520 --> 00:54:10,989
(in the vehicle for a hint on the deity of light?)

1636
00:54:10,989 --> 00:54:12,560
The deity of darkness is there.

1637
00:54:12,560 --> 00:54:15,100
One team in the front row should get off.

1638
00:54:15,100 --> 00:54:16,830
I got here the fastest.

1639
00:54:16,830 --> 00:54:18,569
While Seok Jin got here the fastest...

1640
00:54:18,569 --> 00:54:20,170
Ji Hyo got here the last.

1641
00:54:20,170 --> 00:54:22,000
- Ji Hyo got here the last. - But...

1642
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:23,440
You should decide among yourselves.

1643
00:54:23,440 --> 00:54:25,214
Rock-paper-scissors!

1644
00:54:25,310 --> 00:54:27,285
Rock-paper-scissors! Rock-paper-scissors!

1645
00:54:27,540 --> 00:54:28,679
(Se Chan wins!)

1646
00:54:28,679 --> 00:54:31,580
Okay! You are out.

1647
00:54:31,580 --> 00:54:33,325
(One member remains.)

1648
00:54:34,520 --> 00:54:35,520
- He won. - I won.

1649
00:54:35,520 --> 00:54:37,150
- Only one member won. - That's right.

1650
00:54:37,150 --> 00:54:38,794
Rock-paper-scissors!

1651
00:54:39,219 --> 00:54:40,460
(So Min wins!)

1652
00:54:40,460 --> 00:54:42,560
- Okay! - Let's go.

1653
00:54:42,560 --> 00:54:44,830
(He admits defeat now.)

1654
00:54:44,830 --> 00:54:45,905
Let's go.

1655
00:54:46,290 --> 00:54:47,460
- Let's go. - Let's go.

1656
00:54:47,460 --> 00:54:49,100
- My goodness. - Let's go.

1657
00:54:49,100 --> 00:54:51,170
- Seok Jin is cool. - He is cool.

1658
00:54:51,170 --> 00:54:52,575
- Seok Jin is cool. - He is cool.

1659
00:54:52,600 --> 00:54:54,400
I thought you were good at rock-paper-scissors.

1660
00:54:54,400 --> 00:54:56,400
(Seok Jin and Ji Hyo move to the other vehicle.)

1661
00:54:56,400 --> 00:54:58,440
I knew these members would get on this vehicle.

1662
00:54:58,440 --> 00:54:59,440
Seriously.

1663
00:54:59,440 --> 00:55:00,739
(The teams)

1664
00:55:00,739 --> 00:55:01,940
(The vehicle for a hint on the deity of darkness)

1665
00:55:01,940 --> 00:55:03,155
(The vehicle for a hint on the deity of light)

1666
00:55:03,210 --> 00:55:05,955
I think the deity of darkness is...

1667
00:55:06,449 --> 00:55:08,049
among us.

1668
00:55:08,049 --> 00:55:10,089
- Be quiet. - It's not me.

1669
00:55:10,089 --> 00:55:11,089
It's Sunny.

1670
00:55:11,089 --> 00:55:12,650
- It's not me. - The deity of darkness is among us.

1671
00:55:12,650 --> 00:55:15,294
I am certain the deity of darkness is among us.

1672
00:55:15,719 --> 00:55:16,759
I am 100 percent sure...

1673
00:55:16,759 --> 00:55:18,464
since this is the vehicle for a hint on the deity of light.

1674
00:55:18,730 --> 00:55:20,060
Is this the vehicle for a hint on the deity of darkness?

1675
00:55:20,060 --> 00:55:22,060
(What?)

1676
00:55:22,060 --> 00:55:23,600
- The deity of light. - Really?

1677
00:55:23,600 --> 00:55:24,799
- The deity of light. - The deity of light?

1678
00:55:24,799 --> 00:55:27,100
- What is up with you? - She is eccentric.

1679
00:55:27,100 --> 00:55:29,299
- But Haha wanted... - I wanted to choose...

1680
00:55:29,299 --> 00:55:31,310
the other vehicle, but we were too late.

1681
00:55:31,310 --> 00:55:34,009
- She isn't interested in deducting. - That's right.

1682
00:55:34,009 --> 00:55:36,279
It looks like you achieved your goal.

1683
00:55:36,279 --> 00:55:37,810
- I am exhausted. - What's your goal?

1684
00:55:37,810 --> 00:55:38,980
- The top searched keyword? - No!

1685
00:55:38,980 --> 00:55:40,350
You achieved that goal.

1686
00:55:40,350 --> 00:55:41,619
You made the top searched keyword.

1687
00:55:41,619 --> 00:55:44,089
(Real-time Keyword Search Ranking)

1688
00:55:44,089 --> 00:55:45,290
You made the top searched keyword.

1689
00:55:45,290 --> 00:55:46,964
(It's her mission to become the most searched keyword.)

1690
00:55:48,259 --> 00:55:49,259
- That's not right. - Now,

1691
00:55:49,259 --> 00:55:51,989
you will have a simple mission for a chance to achieve a hint.

1692
00:55:51,989 --> 00:55:55,230
If all three couples succeed,

1693
00:55:55,299 --> 00:55:56,830
you will get a hint on the deity of darkness.

1694
00:55:56,830 --> 00:55:58,069
- Really? - All right.

1695
00:55:58,069 --> 00:55:59,369
We need to join forces.

1696
00:55:59,369 --> 00:56:01,544
You will get caught if you do something strange.

1697
00:56:02,069 --> 00:56:04,685
Do you understand? If one of you is the deity of darkness...

1698
00:56:04,839 --> 00:56:06,210
- He or she will mess up on purpose. - That's right.

1699
00:56:06,210 --> 00:56:08,080
Don't make it so obvious.

1700
00:56:08,080 --> 00:56:09,110
One of us could be the deity of darkness.

1701
00:56:09,110 --> 00:56:10,710
The mission is...

1702
00:56:10,710 --> 00:56:13,549
- Speech Balloon 5, 4, 3, 2, 1. - Speech balloon?

1703
00:56:13,549 --> 00:56:16,150
The couple will take turns after listening to the question.

1704
00:56:16,150 --> 00:56:18,089
If they answer each question in a 5, 4, 3, 2, 1-word answer...

1705
00:56:18,089 --> 00:56:20,135
one after another,

1706
00:56:20,290 --> 00:56:21,394
it's a success.

1707
00:56:21,489 --> 00:56:23,159
So Min and Se Chan, why don't you go first?

1708
00:56:23,159 --> 00:56:24,389
Okay. We will go first.

1709
00:56:24,389 --> 00:56:27,699
Get ready. Set, go.

1710
00:56:27,699 --> 00:56:29,774
What is your partner's biggest charm?

1711
00:56:30,270 --> 00:56:31,630
The big and protruding mouth.

1712
00:56:31,630 --> 00:56:33,374
(She give a five-word answer.)

1713
00:56:33,540 --> 00:56:35,100
Which nickname do you want to give to your partner?

1714
00:56:35,100 --> 00:56:37,444
(Which nickname do you want to give to your partner?)

1715
00:56:38,009 --> 00:56:41,009
Female Han Min Kwan.

1716
00:56:41,009 --> 00:56:42,909
(Female Han Min Kwan?)

1717
00:56:42,909 --> 00:56:45,110
- Female Han Min Kwan. - What do you ask of your partner?

1718
00:56:45,110 --> 00:56:46,880
(What do you ask of your partner?)

1719
00:56:46,880 --> 00:56:48,279
(What could be her answer?)

1720
00:56:48,279 --> 00:56:49,354
Your honest feelings.

1721
00:56:49,449 --> 00:56:52,619
- Your honest feelings. - You answered too late.

1722
00:56:52,619 --> 00:56:53,894
(So Min, what did you say?)

1723
00:56:54,420 --> 00:56:55,420
- What? - "Your honest feelings"?

1724
00:56:55,420 --> 00:56:56,730
- Was that... - Three words.

1725
00:56:56,730 --> 00:56:57,730
- "Your honest feelings"! - Was that a confession?

1726
00:56:57,730 --> 00:56:59,089
- No! - Three words.

1727
00:56:59,089 --> 00:57:00,799
"Your honest feelings" is a three-word answer.

1728
00:57:00,799 --> 00:57:02,100
"Your honest feelings".

1729
00:57:02,100 --> 00:57:03,799
May I get off?

1730
00:57:03,799 --> 00:57:05,529
- I mean... - Hey.

1731
00:57:05,529 --> 00:57:08,839
Since my answer was "Female Han Min Kwan",

1732
00:57:08,839 --> 00:57:10,639
I feel so uncomfortable.

1733
00:57:10,639 --> 00:57:12,739
Why are you smiling from ear to ear?

1734
00:57:12,739 --> 00:57:13,810
- I mean... - When these moments are repeated...

1735
00:57:13,810 --> 00:57:18,179
When these moments are repeated, you begin to think about them.

1736
00:57:18,179 --> 00:57:20,679
(The repeated moments brought on this romantic answer.)

1737
00:57:20,679 --> 00:57:22,150
- Don't be so happy about it. - Okay, okay.

1738
00:57:22,150 --> 00:57:23,549
- My goodness. - Don't be so happy about it.

1739
00:57:23,549 --> 00:57:25,595
- I will give you another chance. - Okay.

1740
00:57:25,690 --> 00:57:28,190
- That was hilarious. - Let's begin.

1741
00:57:28,190 --> 00:57:29,564
What would you say if Se Chan asks you out?

1742
00:57:29,889 --> 00:57:31,234
I would definitely say yes.

1743
00:57:31,759 --> 00:57:32,889
What would you say if So Min asks you out?

1744
00:57:32,889 --> 00:57:34,360
(What would you say if So Min asks you out?)

1745
00:57:34,360 --> 00:57:35,475
I would love that.

1746
00:57:35,529 --> 00:57:36,830
What?

1747
00:57:36,830 --> 00:57:39,000
(You would love that?)

1748
00:57:39,000 --> 00:57:40,100
What's your number one treasure?

1749
00:57:40,100 --> 00:57:41,569
Yang Se Chan!

1750
00:57:41,569 --> 00:57:42,900
(Yang Se Chan!)

1751
00:57:42,900 --> 00:57:45,909
(You are my treasure, Se Chan.)

1752
00:57:45,969 --> 00:57:48,210
What do you want to achieve this year?

1753
00:57:48,210 --> 00:57:50,009
(What do you want to achieve this year?)

1754
00:57:50,009 --> 00:57:51,009
True love.

1755
00:57:51,009 --> 00:57:52,679
(Of course, it is.)

1756
00:57:52,710 --> 00:57:53,980
How would you call your lover?

1757
00:57:53,980 --> 00:57:54,980
Chu.

1758
00:57:54,980 --> 00:57:57,664
(Chu)

1759
00:57:57,889 --> 00:57:58,989
(Se Chan loves it.)

1760
00:57:59,049 --> 00:58:00,790
(Let us love each other.)

1761
00:58:00,790 --> 00:58:03,905
I am getting off. Please stop the van.

1762
00:58:03,929 --> 00:58:06,164
The two of you should get off together.

1763
00:58:06,360 --> 00:58:07,560
This is mine.

1764
00:58:07,560 --> 00:58:09,299
- We succeeded! - This seat belt is mine.

1765
00:58:09,299 --> 00:58:10,500
This seat belt is mine.

1766
00:58:10,500 --> 00:58:12,199
- I got goosebumps. - We succeeded,

1767
00:58:12,199 --> 00:58:13,199
but it was too...

1768
00:58:13,199 --> 00:58:15,944
They even got their seat belts mixed up.

1769
00:58:16,100 --> 00:58:17,610
I can't believe it.

1770
00:58:17,670 --> 00:58:20,009
It was the best verbal exchange.

1771
00:58:20,009 --> 00:58:22,155
Ronaldo and Messi are on the same team.

1772
00:58:22,509 --> 00:58:23,750
The last part was the best.

1773
00:58:23,750 --> 00:58:25,779
(They succeeded with the power of love.)

1774
00:58:25,779 --> 00:58:28,150
Get ready. Set, go.

1775
00:58:28,150 --> 00:58:29,425
What did you do last night?

1776
00:58:29,779 --> 00:58:31,589
I slept tight and pooped.

1777
00:58:31,589 --> 00:58:33,124
(He gives a five-word answer.)

1778
00:58:33,520 --> 00:58:34,865
What do you do when you are bored?

1779
00:58:34,889 --> 00:58:36,790
I have a meal.

1780
00:58:36,790 --> 00:58:38,635
(She gives a four-word answer.)

1781
00:58:39,190 --> 00:58:40,500
What do you do when you are in a good mood?

1782
00:58:40,560 --> 00:58:41,635
I dance alone.

1783
00:58:41,799 --> 00:58:42,935
Which famous person do you admire?

1784
00:58:43,360 --> 00:58:44,675
Hwang Hee.

1785
00:58:46,130 --> 00:58:47,270
Which movie do you recommend?

1786
00:58:47,270 --> 00:58:49,400
(Which movie do you recommend?)

1787
00:58:49,400 --> 00:58:51,509
"Mulberry".

1788
00:58:51,509 --> 00:58:53,484
("Mulberry")

1789
00:58:53,909 --> 00:58:55,639
(While it's a correct answer...)

1790
00:58:55,639 --> 00:58:57,449
It's... It's a one-word answer.

1791
00:58:57,449 --> 00:58:58,949
- A one-word answer. - That's right. You succeeded.

1792
00:58:58,949 --> 00:59:01,024
Okay. Ye Won, we need to succeed.

1793
00:59:01,279 --> 00:59:03,049
- Okay. - Make sure you succeed.

1794
00:59:03,049 --> 00:59:04,964
- We need to do a good job. - Let's go.

1795
00:59:05,719 --> 00:59:06,920
Let's begin.

1796
00:59:06,920 --> 00:59:08,290
What is in your fridge at home?

1797
00:59:08,290 --> 00:59:09,389
(What is in your fridge at home?)

1798
00:59:09,389 --> 00:59:11,790
Clear broth from chicken soup.

1799
00:59:11,790 --> 00:59:13,234
What is in your fridge at home?

1800
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:15,075
Some home-cooked side dishes.

1801
00:59:15,929 --> 00:59:17,400
What do you want to take to a deserted island?

1802
00:59:17,429 --> 00:59:19,004
- My cell phone. - What's your nickname?

1803
00:59:19,770 --> 00:59:20,874
Foolish girl.

1804
00:59:21,000 --> 00:59:22,170
(She gives a two-word answer.)

1805
00:59:22,170 --> 00:59:24,015
What was your childhood dream?

1806
00:59:24,170 --> 00:59:25,670
(My childhood dream?)

1807
00:59:25,670 --> 00:59:26,670
Poop.

1808
00:59:26,670 --> 00:59:28,179
(Poop)

1809
00:59:28,179 --> 00:59:29,710
- Yes! - We did it!

1810
00:59:29,710 --> 00:59:31,210
We did it! It works!

1811
00:59:31,210 --> 00:59:32,880
- "Poop". - It's true.

1812
00:59:32,880 --> 00:59:35,049
- Okay. - He was asked this question.

1813
00:59:35,049 --> 00:59:36,889
- My answer was "Poop" then too. - That's right.

1814
00:59:36,889 --> 00:59:38,894
I'm being consistent.

1815
00:59:39,589 --> 00:59:40,589
What was your childhood dream?

1816
00:59:40,589 --> 00:59:42,819
(He's been saying that his dream was to be poop.)

1817
00:59:42,819 --> 00:59:47,774
(He's been saying that his dream was to be poop.)

1818
00:59:47,860 --> 00:59:49,104
He's right.

1819
00:59:50,330 --> 00:59:52,274
- Yes! - Okay!

1820
00:59:52,630 --> 00:59:54,040
The deity of darkness isn't one of us.

1821
00:59:54,069 --> 00:59:56,369
- We're good. - Good job.

1822
00:59:56,369 --> 00:59:58,115
You succeeded,

1823
00:59:58,139 --> 00:59:59,544
so I'll give you a hint.

1824
00:59:59,739 --> 01:00:00,980
You can share it with each other.

1825
01:00:00,980 --> 01:00:03,414
You can also decide...

1826
01:00:03,650 --> 01:00:05,049
who'll keep this hint.

1827
01:00:05,049 --> 01:00:06,779
Should we look first then do rock-paper-scissors?

1828
01:00:06,779 --> 01:00:07,819
- Yes. - Let's look first.

1829
01:00:07,819 --> 01:00:09,080
- We have to look first. - I'll give it to you.

1830
01:00:09,080 --> 01:00:10,150
(A hint on the deity of darkness is shared with everybody.)

1831
01:00:10,150 --> 01:00:11,190
Open it there.

1832
01:00:11,190 --> 01:00:12,449
Okay. Look.

1833
01:00:12,449 --> 01:00:14,560
"The deity of darkness was not born in the Year of the Horse."

1834
01:00:14,619 --> 01:00:16,589
"Jee Seok Jin and Jang Ye Won are excluded."

1835
01:00:16,589 --> 01:00:18,989
(The deity of darkness was not born in the Year of the Horse.)

1836
01:00:18,989 --> 01:00:20,604
- So it's not Ye Won. - Year of the Horse is...

1837
01:00:20,730 --> 01:00:22,230
They're 12 years apart.

1838
01:00:22,230 --> 01:00:23,975
That's right. That's a new fact.

1839
01:00:24,369 --> 01:00:25,944
That's a new fact.

1840
01:00:26,069 --> 01:00:27,444
No, they're more than 12 years apart.

1841
01:00:29,540 --> 01:00:31,610
(What? Why is there a picture?)

1842
01:00:31,610 --> 01:00:33,540
Seok Jin and I are 20 years apart.

1843
01:00:33,540 --> 01:00:36,480
Let's decide who's going to keep the hint.

1844
01:00:36,480 --> 01:00:38,009
- Let's do rock-paper-scissors. - Rock-paper-scissors?

1845
01:00:38,009 --> 01:00:39,110
(They'll decide with rock-paper-scissors.)

1846
01:00:39,110 --> 01:00:41,024
- There's something on the back. - There is?

1847
01:00:41,119 --> 01:00:42,854
- We have to win. - There's something on the back?

1848
01:00:42,880 --> 01:00:45,095
Just do rock-paper-scissors.

1849
01:00:45,549 --> 01:00:47,489
- You're so slow. - Hold on.

1850
01:00:47,489 --> 01:00:48,889
- Give it to me. - We have to share it.

1851
01:00:48,960 --> 01:00:50,705
- It's nothing. - Give it to me for a moment.

1852
01:00:51,029 --> 01:00:52,159
- Give it to me. - Everybody,

1853
01:00:52,159 --> 01:00:54,130
- calm down. - Give it to me for a moment.

1854
01:00:54,130 --> 01:00:55,400
Hey, you're so...

1855
01:00:55,460 --> 01:00:56,659
- So Min. - Yes.

1856
01:00:56,659 --> 01:00:58,029
Give it to me for a moment.

1857
01:00:58,029 --> 01:00:59,770
- Let's see it together first. - Hey.

1858
01:00:59,770 --> 01:01:01,139
- Let's see first. - What is it?

1859
01:01:01,139 --> 01:01:02,374
(She gets the hint card taken away.)

1860
01:01:02,839 --> 01:01:04,139
- Let me see it too. - "Black swan"?

1861
01:01:04,139 --> 01:01:05,885
(What's this?)

1862
01:01:06,339 --> 01:01:08,885
(There's a picture on the back.)

1863
01:01:08,980 --> 01:01:13,584
(Black swan)

1864
01:01:13,619 --> 01:01:16,279
- There's something in the picture. - There's something.

1865
01:01:16,279 --> 01:01:17,850
We have to keep this then.

1866
01:01:17,850 --> 01:01:19,164
That's right.

1867
01:01:19,420 --> 01:01:20,920
This is not a black swan.

1868
01:01:20,920 --> 01:01:22,095
That's true.

1869
01:01:22,420 --> 01:01:23,520
Is this not a black swan?

1870
01:01:23,520 --> 01:01:24,730
It's not.

1871
01:01:24,730 --> 01:01:25,730
(How is this swan a black swan?)

1872
01:01:25,730 --> 01:01:26,790
What's a black swan?

1873
01:01:26,790 --> 01:01:28,035
(It's English.)

1874
01:01:28,630 --> 01:01:31,529
(What does it mean?)

1875
01:01:31,529 --> 01:01:33,029
- I'm asking because I don't know. - Hey.

1876
01:01:33,029 --> 01:01:34,040
Just show me then.

1877
01:01:34,040 --> 01:01:35,274
Se Chan.

1878
01:01:35,299 --> 01:01:36,874
It says "black swan".

1879
01:01:37,610 --> 01:01:38,969
It means a swan that's black,

1880
01:01:39,040 --> 01:01:40,580
but this is not black.

1881
01:01:40,610 --> 01:01:42,354
- This is just a swan. - A swan.

1882
01:01:43,040 --> 01:01:44,484
What does this mean?

1883
01:01:44,980 --> 01:01:46,555
Let's do rock-paper-scissors.

1884
01:01:46,679 --> 01:01:47,750
Go, Se Chan.

1885
01:01:47,750 --> 01:01:49,024
Rock-paper-scissors

1886
01:01:49,319 --> 01:01:51,049
(Kwang Soo is out.)

1887
01:01:51,049 --> 01:01:52,219
Things are working out today.

1888
01:01:52,219 --> 01:01:53,464
Rock-paper-scissors

1889
01:01:53,960 --> 01:01:55,560
(Jae Seok wins.)

1890
01:01:55,560 --> 01:01:56,819
- I knew it. - We got it.

1891
01:01:56,819 --> 01:01:58,190
(Jae Seok and Ye Won will keep the hint.)

1892
01:01:58,190 --> 01:01:59,290
- What's this? - Why did you...

1893
01:01:59,290 --> 01:02:01,299
(What does the picture mean?)

1894
01:02:01,299 --> 01:02:02,535
Let's look.

1895
01:02:02,730 --> 01:02:03,944
This is a hint about the deity of light.

1896
01:02:04,600 --> 01:02:06,130
"The deity of light is not in their 20s."

1897
01:02:06,130 --> 01:02:07,675
(The deity of light is not in their 20s.)

1898
01:02:08,699 --> 01:02:12,069
(The deity of light is not in their 20s. Exclude SUNMI.)

1899
01:02:12,069 --> 01:02:13,409
Is SUNMI the only one in her 20s?

1900
01:02:13,409 --> 01:02:14,409
(SUNMI is not the deity of light.)

1901
01:02:14,409 --> 01:02:15,814
That excludes SUNMI.

1902
01:02:16,009 --> 01:02:17,350
- She's the only one excluded. - How old are you?

1903
01:02:17,380 --> 01:02:19,179
"The deity of light is not in their 20s."

1904
01:02:19,179 --> 01:02:20,650
Did you take the hint?

1905
01:02:20,650 --> 01:02:22,095
Of course.

1906
01:02:22,119 --> 01:02:23,279
Did you take it?

1907
01:02:23,279 --> 01:02:24,489
- Yes. - Of course.

1908
01:02:24,520 --> 01:02:25,825
Don't show it to them.

1909
01:02:25,850 --> 01:02:26,964
Cover it.

1910
01:02:27,520 --> 01:02:29,060
It's not me.

1911
01:02:29,060 --> 01:02:30,805
- I'm serious. - It can't be anybody else.

1912
01:02:31,589 --> 01:02:33,830
This is my first time meeting Ye Won,

1913
01:02:33,830 --> 01:02:35,029
but it feels like I've known her for five years.

1914
01:02:35,029 --> 01:02:36,759
- It's like I knew her for 10 years. - Right?

1915
01:02:36,759 --> 01:02:39,504
- That's how she behaves. - I feel comfortable.

1916
01:02:39,569 --> 01:02:41,270
- That's nice. - She has a great personality.

1917
01:02:41,270 --> 01:02:42,345
I approve.

1918
01:02:42,969 --> 01:02:44,144
I approve.

1919
01:02:44,710 --> 01:02:46,610
I think you 2 should try dating for like 2 months.

1920
01:02:46,610 --> 01:02:47,779
(You two look good together.)

1921
01:02:47,779 --> 01:02:50,155
- What is your type of man? - I like...

1922
01:02:50,179 --> 01:02:52,210
men who focus on the family.

1923
01:02:52,210 --> 01:02:54,024
- That's him 100 percent. Approved. - That's him.

1924
01:02:55,250 --> 01:02:58,619
(He only cares about family.)

1925
01:02:58,619 --> 01:02:59,690
That's really him.

1926
01:02:59,690 --> 01:03:01,690
I just got goosebumps. That hasn't happened in a while.

1927
01:03:01,690 --> 01:03:03,159
I really like men...

1928
01:03:03,159 --> 01:03:05,830
who focus on family more than work.

1929
01:03:05,830 --> 01:03:07,175
That's 100 percent him. And then?

1930
01:03:07,560 --> 01:03:09,159
And men who like children.

1931
01:03:09,159 --> 01:03:10,334
What?

1932
01:03:10,569 --> 01:03:11,730
Stop acting.

1933
01:03:11,730 --> 01:03:13,670
- Who doesn't like children? - Stop acting.

1934
01:03:13,739 --> 01:03:15,199
Who doesn't like children?

1935
01:03:15,199 --> 01:03:16,469
- No, many people don't. - I didn't really like children.

1936
01:03:16,469 --> 01:03:18,139
He likes children so much that people say he may have one.

1937
01:03:18,139 --> 01:03:19,310
Really?

1938
01:03:19,310 --> 01:03:20,440
(He likes children so much that people say he may have one.)

1939
01:03:20,440 --> 01:03:21,880
That's how much he likes children. There's a rumor.

1940
01:03:21,880 --> 01:03:23,480
- That's tough. - I have a child in America.

1941
01:03:23,480 --> 01:03:25,155
- That's tough. - People say I have children.

1942
01:03:26,250 --> 01:03:28,250
- Is this the right place? - Yes, it is.

1943
01:03:28,250 --> 01:03:30,020
(The deity of light team arrives at the next mission location.)

1944
01:03:30,020 --> 01:03:31,394
Do you have the hint?

1945
01:03:31,549 --> 01:03:33,765
Right, I left it on the bus.

1946
01:03:34,119 --> 01:03:35,420
- Hurry. - Hold on. You can't do that.

1947
01:03:35,420 --> 01:03:36,865
Whoever finds it first gets to keep it.

1948
01:03:36,889 --> 01:03:38,635
- "You can't do that." - Run, Se Chan.

1949
01:03:38,659 --> 01:03:39,805
That's what Jae Seok said.

1950
01:03:41,100 --> 01:03:43,730
I think you took it.

1951
01:03:43,730 --> 01:03:44,869
(Kwang Soo is a key suspect.)

1952
01:03:44,869 --> 01:03:46,004
- No. - Be honest.

1953
01:03:46,029 --> 01:03:47,170
I think he took it.

1954
01:03:47,170 --> 01:03:48,839
Search him. Let me check.

1955
01:03:48,839 --> 01:03:50,909
(They start searching Kwang Soo.)

1956
01:03:50,909 --> 01:03:53,469
- I have it. - Right? You have it.

1957
01:03:53,469 --> 01:03:56,214
(Kwang Soo has the hint?)

1958
01:03:56,480 --> 01:03:57,655
He actually took it.

1959
01:03:57,810 --> 01:03:59,250
(He has the hint!)

1960
01:03:59,250 --> 01:04:00,779
We'll pretend we don't know.

1961
01:04:00,779 --> 01:04:02,520
(How did Kwang Soo take the hint from Jae Seok?)

1962
01:04:02,520 --> 01:04:04,520
I don't really...

1963
01:04:04,520 --> 01:04:08,435
(Jae Seok put it in the seat in front of him.)

1964
01:04:09,319 --> 01:04:10,790
(He forgot that he left it there and got up.)

1965
01:04:10,790 --> 01:04:13,529
(He forgot that he left it there and got up.)

1966
01:04:13,529 --> 01:04:16,374
(Kwang Soo didn't miss the chance.)

1967
01:04:17,230 --> 01:04:20,770
(He quickly stole the hint.)

1968
01:04:20,770 --> 01:04:24,644
(That's how Kwang Soo took it.)

1969
01:04:25,210 --> 01:04:26,414
Where is it?

1970
01:04:27,409 --> 01:04:28,610
Somebody took it.

1971
01:04:28,610 --> 01:04:31,955
(He tries looking for it, but it's gone already.)

1972
01:04:33,380 --> 01:04:34,794
- Keep it. - Jae Seok is coming.

1973
01:04:35,679 --> 01:04:36,980
You have to share it at the end.

1974
01:04:36,980 --> 01:04:38,325
I will.

1975
01:04:38,949 --> 01:04:40,425
- Is it gone? - It's gone.

1976
01:04:40,520 --> 01:04:41,759
- No way. - Does Ye Won have it?

1977
01:04:41,759 --> 01:04:42,964
She said she doesn't.

1978
01:04:44,259 --> 01:04:45,690
(He looks around.)

1979
01:04:45,690 --> 01:04:47,900
(He makes eye contact with the key suspect.)

1980
01:04:47,900 --> 01:04:49,234
Give it to me, Kwang Soo.

1981
01:04:49,799 --> 01:04:51,874
What are you talking about?

1982
01:04:52,500 --> 01:04:54,015
- I swear it's not me. - Let's see.

1983
01:04:54,540 --> 01:04:55,714
Where did you leave it?

1984
01:04:56,369 --> 01:04:57,944
Where did you take it from?

1985
01:04:58,770 --> 01:05:00,210
Why would you ask that?

1986
01:05:00,270 --> 01:05:02,785
- I swear it's not me. - Hand it over.

1987
01:05:02,810 --> 01:05:04,024
You were the last one to leave.

1988
01:05:04,810 --> 01:05:06,350
I understand why you're suspecting me.

1989
01:05:06,350 --> 01:05:08,394
I'm not just suspecting you. Just hand it over.

1990
01:05:08,750 --> 01:05:09,995
I really don't have it.

1991
01:05:10,690 --> 01:05:12,150
Can you lift your shirt?

1992
01:05:12,219 --> 01:05:14,159
Lift what? Go ahead.

1993
01:05:14,190 --> 01:05:15,290
Let's take his pants off.

1994
01:05:15,290 --> 01:05:18,234
(Let's do that.)

1995
01:05:18,529 --> 01:05:20,535
- Kwang Soo. - That's possible.

1996
01:05:20,560 --> 01:05:21,935
- I'm an adult. - You never know.

1997
01:05:22,130 --> 01:05:24,000
- Go to the bathroom with him. - You can't do that.

1998
01:05:24,000 --> 01:05:25,529
- Take his pants off. - He would do that.

1999
01:05:25,529 --> 01:05:27,270
- He would definitely do that. - Please sit down.

2000
01:05:27,270 --> 01:05:28,569
We'll start the mission.

2001
01:05:28,569 --> 01:05:30,569
- Goodness. - This is...

2002
01:05:30,569 --> 01:05:32,345
- You didn't see it at all, right? - Where did it go?

2003
01:05:32,440 --> 01:05:33,615
What is that?

2004
01:05:33,909 --> 01:05:36,279
During this mission, you can win both a hint...

2005
01:05:36,279 --> 01:05:37,710
and meal vouchers.

2006
01:05:37,710 --> 01:05:38,949
- Let's eat. - Please.

2007
01:05:38,949 --> 01:05:40,580
It's called Inner Peace Traffic Light.

2008
01:05:40,580 --> 01:05:42,325
- "Inner Peace"? - "Inner Peace Traffic Light"?

2009
01:05:42,380 --> 01:05:43,750
- You have to resist. - Each couple...

2010
01:05:43,750 --> 01:05:45,719
will take turns.

2011
01:05:45,719 --> 01:05:48,060
One person from each couple will put on a headband...

2012
01:05:48,060 --> 01:05:49,759
that changes colors according to your pulse and heat reading.

2013
01:05:49,759 --> 01:05:50,889
- Is there such a thing? - That's interesting.

2014
01:05:50,960 --> 01:05:52,690
Within 30 seconds,

2015
01:05:52,690 --> 01:05:55,205
other couples can ask you questions.

2016
01:05:55,230 --> 01:05:57,575
If you endure, you win.

2017
01:05:57,699 --> 01:05:59,929
If the red light comes on, you lose.

2018
01:05:59,929 --> 01:06:01,440
- We can cool ourselves? - Sorry?

2019
01:06:01,440 --> 01:06:02,670
You can cool yourselves with a water spray.

2020
01:06:02,670 --> 01:06:04,084
- As long as you don't get hot. - I see.

2021
01:06:04,270 --> 01:06:05,940
- All right. - This is pretty accurate.

2022
01:06:05,940 --> 01:06:07,110
- We tested it. - Really?

2023
01:06:07,110 --> 01:06:08,914
- Are you sure? - It's quite accurate.

2024
01:06:09,040 --> 01:06:10,310
The couple that maintains inner peace for the longest time...

2025
01:06:10,310 --> 01:06:12,480
without the red light coming on...

2026
01:06:12,480 --> 01:06:13,850
gets meal vouchers...

2027
01:06:13,850 --> 01:06:15,595
and hints about the deity of light and the prophet.

2028
01:06:16,080 --> 01:06:17,889
- This is intense. - We have to win.

2029
01:06:17,889 --> 01:06:20,225
- What about 2nd place? - 2nd place couple gets vouchers.

2030
01:06:20,420 --> 01:06:21,690
- Let's get second place at least. - Last place gets...

2031
01:06:21,690 --> 01:06:23,394
nothing but seaweed and rice.

2032
01:06:23,520 --> 01:06:26,635
I'm not good at maintaining inner peace.

2033
01:06:27,860 --> 01:06:29,360
(As soon as the green light comes on, you can ask questions.)

2034
01:06:29,360 --> 01:06:30,604
I'm nervous.

2035
01:06:31,230 --> 01:06:32,544
It rises when it heats up.

2036
01:06:32,900 --> 01:06:34,044
Questions.

2037
01:06:34,540 --> 01:06:35,839
(They start asking questions.)

2038
01:06:35,839 --> 01:06:37,044
Questions.

2039
01:06:37,369 --> 01:06:38,639
I love you, Se Chan.

2040
01:06:38,639 --> 01:06:41,810
(She tries to make So Min jealous.)

2041
01:06:41,810 --> 01:06:43,239
(She maintains inner peace.)

2042
01:06:43,239 --> 01:06:44,785
(She can't.)

2043
01:06:44,880 --> 01:06:46,509
- What? - Don't! Go down!

2044
01:06:46,509 --> 01:06:48,020
- What? - Spray water on her.

2045
01:06:48,020 --> 01:06:49,825
- Go down! - What was that?

2046
01:06:50,049 --> 01:06:51,049
So Min.

2047
01:06:51,049 --> 01:06:52,394
(Calm down, So Min.)

2048
01:06:52,889 --> 01:06:54,319
It's okay now. It's falling.

2049
01:06:54,319 --> 01:06:56,290
- We have to ask questions. - Ask.

2050
01:06:56,290 --> 01:06:58,429
- Se Chan, go out with me. - It came down.

2051
01:06:58,429 --> 01:06:59,790
(She tries to make So Min jealous again.)

2052
01:06:59,790 --> 01:07:02,305
(This is SUNMI's 2nd attack.)

2053
01:07:02,630 --> 01:07:04,305
- Go out with me. - It came down.

2054
01:07:04,400 --> 01:07:07,004
(She caves in.)

2055
01:07:09,369 --> 01:07:11,845
It's SUNMI. What's wrong with you?

2056
01:07:12,040 --> 01:07:13,569
(SUNMI kept on confessing.)

2057
01:07:13,569 --> 01:07:14,679
Good.

2058
01:07:14,679 --> 01:07:15,739
I understand.

2059
01:07:15,739 --> 01:07:18,055
(So Min's feelings for Se Chan got revealed.)

2060
01:07:18,850 --> 01:07:20,725
That was incredible.

2061
01:07:20,819 --> 01:07:22,920
Doesn't it go up because your temperature rises?

2062
01:07:22,920 --> 01:07:25,294
That's right. It senses changes.

2063
01:07:25,949 --> 01:07:27,589
(Spraying)

2064
01:07:27,589 --> 01:07:29,319
- What are you doing? - Let's cool you down first.

2065
01:07:29,319 --> 01:07:30,734
- We haven't even started. - Stop it.

2066
01:07:30,860 --> 01:07:31,960
(This is her revenge for losing inner peace over Se Chan.)

2067
01:07:31,960 --> 01:07:33,104
We didn't even start.

2068
01:07:33,159 --> 01:07:34,604
- Try to make me flustered. - Okay.

2069
01:07:35,900 --> 01:07:37,130
(Calibration complete. They start asking questions.)

2070
01:07:37,130 --> 01:07:38,630
- It's good. - Are you still dating...

2071
01:07:38,630 --> 01:07:42,414
that stewardess you mentioned on TV in the past?

2072
01:07:43,069 --> 01:07:44,615
- Sorry? - A while ago...

2073
01:07:44,810 --> 01:07:47,380
in Paju, you said you were dating a stewardess.

2074
01:07:47,380 --> 01:07:48,810
- No, not at all. - No, Se Chan.

2075
01:07:48,810 --> 01:07:50,480
- No? - I don't know her number.

2076
01:07:50,480 --> 01:07:52,285
- Se Chan. - It's rising.

2077
01:07:52,509 --> 01:07:54,219
(He gets shaken by the question.)

2078
01:07:54,219 --> 01:07:56,020
- "I don't know her number." - I don't.

2079
01:07:56,020 --> 01:07:57,595
Do you really like So Min?

2080
01:07:59,049 --> 01:08:02,095
(Do you really like So Min?)

2081
01:08:02,389 --> 01:08:06,690
(They may become a couple. How does Se Chan react?)

2082
01:08:06,690 --> 01:08:09,374
(He calms down all of a sudden.)

2083
01:08:10,100 --> 01:08:13,104
(Se Chan's feelings get revealed at Jae Seok's sharp question.)

2084
01:08:13,170 --> 01:08:14,444
It's going down.

2085
01:08:14,699 --> 01:08:15,739
Hey.

2086
01:08:15,799 --> 01:08:17,639
(Why is it dropping?)

2087
01:08:17,639 --> 01:08:18,810
It's going down.

2088
01:08:18,810 --> 01:08:20,185
- It's going up. - It went up.

2089
01:08:20,610 --> 01:08:21,779
(It went down momentarily and is rising back up.)

2090
01:08:21,779 --> 01:08:23,440
- It's going up. - Hey.

2091
01:08:23,440 --> 01:08:24,980
- I have no feelings... - You really like her, right?

2092
01:08:24,980 --> 01:08:26,150
- for So Min. - It's rising more.

2093
01:08:26,150 --> 01:08:27,450
- I have no feelings for her. - So Min.

2094
01:08:27,450 --> 01:08:29,249
(He lies about it.)

2095
01:08:29,249 --> 01:08:31,520
(So Min's strategy fails.)

2096
01:08:31,520 --> 01:08:33,525
- I have no feelings for her. - I think he really likes her.

2097
01:08:33,620 --> 01:08:34,959
It keeps on rising. It's over.

2098
01:08:34,959 --> 01:08:37,864
(He fails to maintain inner peace.)

2099
01:08:38,259 --> 01:08:39,690
This happens.

2100
01:08:39,759 --> 01:08:41,299
- What happened? - It's over.

2101
01:08:41,299 --> 01:08:42,935
Did it go down when you talked about So Min?

2102
01:08:43,160 --> 01:08:44,975
- This is accurate. - As soon as I talked about her.

2103
01:08:45,469 --> 01:08:47,299
It dropped when I talked about So Min.

2104
01:08:47,299 --> 01:08:49,214
It came down and went straight back up.

2105
01:08:49,370 --> 01:08:50,770
That's interesting.

2106
01:08:50,770 --> 01:08:51,839
Kwang Soo.

2107
01:08:51,870 --> 01:08:53,009
(Kwang Soo and SUNMI are next.)

2108
01:08:53,009 --> 01:08:54,185
- It's ready. - It is.

2109
01:08:54,379 --> 01:08:55,614
(Calibration complete. They start asking questions.)

2110
01:08:55,709 --> 01:08:56,879
Are you and Sun Bin doing well?

2111
01:08:56,879 --> 01:08:58,725
(It's his girlfriend.)

2112
01:08:59,209 --> 01:09:01,320
(He drinks green tea to calm down.)

2113
01:09:01,320 --> 01:09:02,525
It went straight up.

2114
01:09:02,780 --> 01:09:04,395
(What's going on?)

2115
01:09:04,850 --> 01:09:07,794
(It shoots up abruptly.)

2116
01:09:07,889 --> 01:09:09,494
No. No!

2117
01:09:09,860 --> 01:09:11,860
- Why? - You're so bad.

2118
01:09:11,860 --> 01:09:12,959
(They asked one question, and it's over.)

2119
01:09:12,959 --> 01:09:14,735
Is something going on between you two? What's wrong?

2120
01:09:14,759 --> 01:09:16,600
No! Why didn't you spray water on me?

2121
01:09:16,600 --> 01:09:17,600
- It didn't even take three seconds. - It's over.

2122
01:09:17,600 --> 01:09:19,230
- It went up to here. - How high was it?

2123
01:09:19,230 --> 01:09:21,039
- Up to the top! - No way.

2124
01:09:21,039 --> 01:09:23,074
It reached the ventilator. I'm serious.

2125
01:09:23,169 --> 01:09:24,339
That's how high it was.

2126
01:09:24,339 --> 01:09:26,015
- It shot up. - I was going to drink this.

2127
01:09:26,709 --> 01:09:28,614
- SUNMI. - That was incredible.

2128
01:09:28,810 --> 01:09:31,209
This gadget is funny.

2129
01:09:31,280 --> 01:09:32,280
Right?

2130
01:09:32,280 --> 01:09:33,379
(SUNMI is next.)

2131
01:09:33,379 --> 01:09:35,120
- Are you ready? - Ask questions.

2132
01:09:35,120 --> 01:09:37,079
Does Kwang Soo look like a proboscis monkey?

2133
01:09:37,079 --> 01:09:39,249
(Randomly?)

2134
01:09:39,249 --> 01:09:40,789
- No. - No?

2135
01:09:40,789 --> 01:09:41,990
What do you mean?

2136
01:09:41,990 --> 01:09:44,565
- Goodness. - What was that?

2137
01:09:45,429 --> 01:09:47,265
- You said I didn't look like one. - Inner peace.

2138
01:09:47,759 --> 01:09:49,929
(As soon as she sees his face...)

2139
01:09:49,929 --> 01:09:51,704
- You said I didn't look like one. - It's over.

2140
01:09:52,999 --> 01:09:56,374
(One after another, the 2 couples both fail.)

2141
01:09:56,940 --> 01:09:58,714
- You said I didn't look like one. - It's over.

2142
01:09:58,839 --> 01:10:01,940
(Kwang Soo and SUNMI both lose it with Jae Seok's question.)

2143
01:10:01,940 --> 01:10:05,009
Jae Seok is great at asking questions.

2144
01:10:05,009 --> 01:10:06,685
- That was a great question. - I wasn't even thinking.

2145
01:10:06,709 --> 01:10:08,079
I'm human. Do I look like a monkey?

2146
01:10:08,079 --> 01:10:10,754
- It's over. - It only takes one question.

2147
01:10:11,520 --> 01:10:13,725
(Jae Seok and Ye Won are next.)

2148
01:10:14,190 --> 01:10:17,660
(They're waiting for the device to reset.)

2149
01:10:17,660 --> 01:10:18,889
He's not pretty, right?

2150
01:10:18,889 --> 01:10:21,805
- You're really ugly right now. - You're really ugly.

2151
01:10:22,060 --> 01:10:24,204
- Are you sad right now? - You look like an alien.

2152
01:10:24,429 --> 01:10:26,004
- Why are you so depressed? - Is he sad?

2153
01:10:26,730 --> 01:10:28,414
- You know you look like an alien. - Does he always look sad?

2154
01:10:29,270 --> 01:10:30,700
Start.

2155
01:10:30,700 --> 01:10:33,770
Give Ji Ho to me.

2156
01:10:33,770 --> 01:10:36,015
(His love for his son boils over.)

2157
01:10:36,139 --> 01:10:37,254
All of a sudden?

2158
01:10:38,150 --> 01:10:40,679
(He fails to maintain inner peace.)

2159
01:10:40,679 --> 01:10:42,150
That was abrupt.

2160
01:10:42,150 --> 01:10:44,919
(He's determined not to give away his son.)

2161
01:10:44,919 --> 01:10:46,624
- That was really abrupt. - Hold on.

2162
01:10:46,990 --> 01:10:48,490
- Why did it go up? - That surprised me.

2163
01:10:48,490 --> 01:10:50,219
- Why did it go up? - Why did you start shaking...

2164
01:10:50,219 --> 01:10:52,690
- when she mentioned Ji Ho? - Why did it go up?

2165
01:10:52,690 --> 01:10:54,435
(His heart bounces when he thinks about his son.)

2166
01:10:54,499 --> 01:10:55,935
What was that?

2167
01:10:56,600 --> 01:10:58,999
That was so random.

2168
01:10:58,999 --> 01:11:00,870
- Kwang Hee. - That was so random.

2169
01:11:00,870 --> 01:11:02,945
Everybody failed, so let's go again.

2170
01:11:03,740 --> 01:11:05,315
- Goodness. - This always goes up.

2171
01:11:05,770 --> 01:11:08,154
- Let's go! - I'm hungry.

2172
01:11:08,209 --> 01:11:09,584
Here are the rules.

2173
01:11:09,639 --> 01:11:11,179
- Is it just us? - Yes.

2174
01:11:11,179 --> 01:11:14,954
It's just us.

2175
01:11:15,719 --> 01:11:17,964
Why?

2176
01:11:18,289 --> 01:11:20,549
(She goes to the end.)

2177
01:11:20,549 --> 01:11:23,395
(Ye Won is next to Jong Kook now.)

2178
01:11:23,660 --> 01:11:24,759
(Nice, Ji Hyo.)

2179
01:11:24,759 --> 01:11:28,759
You can get both hints and meal vouchers in this mission.

2180
01:11:28,759 --> 01:11:30,329
- This mission is... - Okay.

2181
01:11:30,329 --> 01:11:31,400
(They finally notice.)

2182
01:11:31,400 --> 01:11:33,504
(Clicking)

2183
01:11:34,740 --> 01:11:36,070
- Excuse me. - I'm sorry.

2184
01:11:36,070 --> 01:11:37,200
- Excuse me. - I'm sorry.

2185
01:11:37,200 --> 01:11:40,515
(He takes a picture of Jong Kook and Ye Won.)

2186
01:11:40,740 --> 01:11:41,910
Focus on work.

2187
01:11:41,910 --> 01:11:43,440
- I'll cut it out. - That wasn't original.

2188
01:11:43,440 --> 01:11:44,624
- Work. - Okay.

2189
01:11:45,150 --> 01:11:48,695
This mission is called Inner Peace Traffic Light.

2190
01:11:49,280 --> 01:11:51,025
This is my specialty.

2191
01:11:51,549 --> 01:11:52,749
- When you blush? - Inner peace.

2192
01:11:52,749 --> 01:11:53,824
What?

2193
01:11:54,190 --> 01:11:55,490
You know me. I don't really get mad.

2194
01:11:55,490 --> 01:11:56,520
You get mad.

2195
01:11:56,520 --> 01:11:58,560
My heart rate is steady.

2196
01:11:58,560 --> 01:12:00,834
- I don't change. - Mine doesn't go up.

2197
01:12:00,999 --> 01:12:03,660
- You too? - My heart rate.

2198
01:12:03,660 --> 01:12:05,074
Should we start first?

2199
01:12:05,329 --> 01:12:06,600
- Should we? - Okay.

2200
01:12:06,600 --> 01:12:08,070
- Good. - That's good.

2201
01:12:08,070 --> 01:12:10,200
- That looks nice on you. - It's going up. It's at two spaces.

2202
01:12:10,200 --> 01:12:11,440
You should keep it.

2203
01:12:11,440 --> 01:12:13,714
- You're making fun of me. - It's so funny.

2204
01:12:14,139 --> 01:12:15,480
They're making fun of us.

2205
01:12:15,480 --> 01:12:17,555
- Does this work? - You're blushing already.

2206
01:12:17,679 --> 01:12:19,009
- Seok Jin. - I don't get excited.

2207
01:12:19,009 --> 01:12:21,254
- He doesn't get angry. - Start asking questions.

2208
01:12:21,549 --> 01:12:23,350
(They start asking questions.)

2209
01:12:23,350 --> 01:12:26,049
Did your wife find out about your emergency fund?

2210
01:12:26,049 --> 01:12:28,360
We're cool about it now.

2211
01:12:28,360 --> 01:12:30,294
- Did you tell her? - I gave it to her.

2212
01:12:30,320 --> 01:12:31,704
- Really? - Yes.

2213
01:12:31,730 --> 01:12:33,459
- Did you have a lot of money? - Sorry?

2214
01:12:33,459 --> 01:12:35,560
Did you have a lot?

2215
01:12:35,560 --> 01:12:37,135
- Sorry? - Did you have a lot?

2216
01:12:38,499 --> 01:12:39,829
- Emergency fund? - Yes.

2217
01:12:39,829 --> 01:12:42,614
It kills you to think about it.

2218
01:12:42,969 --> 01:12:46,385
(He fails to maintain inner peace.)

2219
01:12:46,870 --> 01:12:50,079
(He caves in because of the emergency fund.)

2220
01:12:50,079 --> 01:12:52,650
It shot right up.

2221
01:12:52,650 --> 01:12:54,650
- He can't control himself. - I didn't do anything.

2222
01:12:54,650 --> 01:12:57,195
You should have sprayed him earlier.

2223
01:12:57,990 --> 01:13:01,060
It shot right up from green to red,

2224
01:13:01,060 --> 01:13:02,459
- so I didn't see it. - Did it?

2225
01:13:02,459 --> 01:13:05,629
It started going up when you said you gave it to her.

2226
01:13:05,629 --> 01:13:07,360
It was Sunny's fault.

2227
01:13:07,360 --> 01:13:08,400
(He's dizzy.)

2228
01:13:08,400 --> 01:13:09,935
I didn't give her all of it.

2229
01:13:10,160 --> 01:13:11,329
He didn't give her everything.

2230
01:13:11,329 --> 01:13:12,874
I told her it was everything and didn't give all of it.

2231
01:13:13,070 --> 01:13:14,914
That's pretty accurate.

2232
01:13:15,539 --> 01:13:16,700
- That was so funny. - Is it accurate?

2233
01:13:16,700 --> 01:13:18,114
- Really? - That was so funny.

2234
01:13:18,469 --> 01:13:19,870
Let's take turns asking questions.

2235
01:13:19,940 --> 01:13:22,209
- What should I ask Haha? Hold on. - For Haha...

2236
01:13:22,209 --> 01:13:24,725
I was mad from the beginning today.

2237
01:13:25,549 --> 01:13:26,885
Take deep breaths.

2238
01:13:26,980 --> 01:13:28,195
Hey.

2239
01:13:28,419 --> 01:13:29,480
- It worked. - Start asking questions.

2240
01:13:29,480 --> 01:13:30,820
(They start asking questions.)

2241
01:13:30,820 --> 01:13:31,919
- Start. - Haha,

2242
01:13:31,919 --> 01:13:35,964
you know the album you released in OJ Project?

2243
01:13:36,060 --> 01:13:37,259
The album.

2244
01:13:37,259 --> 01:13:39,060
- It's okay, Haha. - Do you want to release it again?

2245
01:13:39,060 --> 01:13:40,464
- It may go up on the chart. - It's okay, Haha.

2246
01:13:40,560 --> 01:13:42,259
It's okay, Haha.

2247
01:13:42,259 --> 01:13:43,975
- You should try it. - It's okay, Haha.

2248
01:13:44,570 --> 01:13:46,499
(Spraying)

2249
01:13:46,499 --> 01:13:47,900
(He calms down after Ye Won sprays water.)

2250
01:13:47,900 --> 01:13:49,039
It went down.

2251
01:13:49,039 --> 01:13:50,669
(He calms down after Ye Won sprays water.)

2252
01:13:50,669 --> 01:13:53,515
It worked because she sprayed water.

2253
01:13:53,870 --> 01:13:56,114
(What?)

2254
01:13:56,379 --> 01:13:57,440
Oh, dear.

2255
01:13:57,440 --> 01:14:00,425
(He fails to maintain inner peace as soon as he finishes talking.)

2256
01:14:01,650 --> 01:14:03,780
Is this even possible?

2257
01:14:03,780 --> 01:14:05,589
Does this even work? Is this doable?

2258
01:14:05,589 --> 01:14:06,620
(Is it possible to maintain inner peace?)

2259
01:14:06,620 --> 01:14:07,765
- We're starting. - Okay.

2260
01:14:08,089 --> 01:14:10,860
(Jong Kook is the real master of maintaining inner peace.)

2261
01:14:10,860 --> 01:14:13,904
- Good luck. - I'm known for steady heart rate.

2262
01:14:16,030 --> 01:14:17,435
- I'll start. - Start asking questions.

2263
01:14:17,499 --> 01:14:21,374
Jong Kook, would you watch a movie with Ye Won if she asks?

2264
01:14:21,440 --> 01:14:22,614
And have dinner together?

2265
01:14:23,139 --> 01:14:24,839
That's not difficult.

2266
01:14:24,839 --> 01:14:25,940
That's right.

2267
01:14:25,940 --> 01:14:28,084
He's so powerful.

2268
01:14:28,139 --> 01:14:29,539
Did you fall in love with Ye Won at first sight?

2269
01:14:29,539 --> 01:14:30,740
(This is the 2nd attack.)

2270
01:14:30,740 --> 01:14:32,525
I don't fall in love at first sight.

2271
01:14:33,610 --> 01:14:35,925
(He gets swayed.)

2272
01:14:36,579 --> 01:14:39,020
- Jong Kook, focus. - Jong Kook.

2273
01:14:39,020 --> 01:14:41,490
- Hurry. - Jong Kook, look at me.

2274
01:14:41,490 --> 01:14:42,660
Jong Kook, look at me.

2275
01:14:42,690 --> 01:14:44,664
(Jong Kook, look at me.)

2276
01:14:44,959 --> 01:14:47,164
(Glancing)

2277
01:14:47,360 --> 01:14:48,635
Do you like me?

2278
01:14:50,030 --> 01:14:52,730
(Ye Won makes a shy confession. How does Jong Kook react?)

2279
01:14:52,730 --> 01:14:53,829
Oh, dear.

2280
01:14:53,829 --> 01:14:56,114
(It drops abruptly.)

2281
01:14:56,669 --> 01:14:57,810
What?

2282
01:14:57,810 --> 01:14:59,370
(Jong Kook's heart freezes.)

2283
01:14:59,370 --> 01:15:00,744
- Don't laugh. - It dropped.

2284
01:15:01,410 --> 01:15:02,579
- Why did it drop? - Don't laugh.

2285
01:15:02,579 --> 01:15:03,810
What was that?

2286
01:15:03,810 --> 01:15:05,185
- Haha. - What was that?

2287
01:15:06,009 --> 01:15:07,079
Is it done?

2288
01:15:07,079 --> 01:15:08,320
(Jong Kook manages to maintain inner peace.)

2289
01:15:08,320 --> 01:15:11,324
- Why did it go down? - You should have stayed out.

2290
01:15:11,419 --> 01:15:13,895
- That shouldn't happen. - How did this...

2291
01:15:13,990 --> 01:15:15,360
What happened?

2292
01:15:15,389 --> 01:15:17,095
- What's wrong, Jong Kook? - I challenged myself.

2293
01:15:17,929 --> 01:15:20,160
- I challenged myself. - Jong Kook, that was mean.

2294
01:15:20,230 --> 01:15:21,735
I seriously challenged myself.

2295
01:15:22,530 --> 01:15:24,805
Kwang Soo and SUNMI win first place.

2296
01:15:25,169 --> 01:15:26,929
Let's do a final round to decide the losers.

2297
01:15:26,929 --> 01:15:29,315
(We're in 1st place!)

2298
01:15:29,740 --> 01:15:32,485
Let's do a final round to decide the losers.

2299
01:15:32,539 --> 01:15:33,570
(So Min goes first.)

2300
01:15:33,570 --> 01:15:35,480
What if you confess your love to Se Chan,

2301
01:15:35,480 --> 01:15:36,910
and Se Chan turns you down?

2302
01:15:36,910 --> 01:15:38,055
Then it's too bad.

2303
01:15:38,780 --> 01:15:40,124
Why do you like Se Chan?

2304
01:15:40,579 --> 01:15:41,824
(Her heart rate rises.)

2305
01:15:42,049 --> 01:15:43,280
Why do you like him?

2306
01:15:43,280 --> 01:15:44,725
His gums? Or...

2307
01:15:45,249 --> 01:15:47,895
- It's not his gums. - It's not.

2308
01:15:48,120 --> 01:15:50,860
(She doesn't like me because of my gums.)

2309
01:15:50,860 --> 01:15:52,805
- I shouldn't have said that. - It's not his gums.

2310
01:15:53,060 --> 01:15:54,574
If Se Chan...

2311
01:15:55,459 --> 01:15:57,374
- Okay. - Two.

2312
01:15:57,560 --> 01:15:59,975
So Min, good defense.

2313
01:15:59,999 --> 01:16:02,244
(It's Se Chan's turn next.)

2314
01:16:02,469 --> 01:16:04,784
That stewardess we were talking about.

2315
01:16:05,839 --> 01:16:07,539
(It's the stewardess all the way.)

2316
01:16:07,539 --> 01:16:08,709
I'm sorry.

2317
01:16:08,709 --> 01:16:10,485
(He can't maintain inner peace.)

2318
01:16:11,280 --> 01:16:14,324
(He's knocked down every time the word "stewardess" comes up.)

2319
01:16:15,049 --> 01:16:16,620
What's wrong with you?

2320
01:16:16,620 --> 01:16:19,020
What? What was I saying?

2321
01:16:19,020 --> 01:16:20,624
- Is it over? - Yes.

2322
01:16:20,889 --> 01:16:22,160
It shot right up.

2323
01:16:22,160 --> 01:16:24,065
- I didn't even finish. - Get back.

2324
01:16:24,730 --> 01:16:26,135
You have to sit down.

2325
01:16:27,560 --> 01:16:30,704
Ye Won says she doesn't get swayed by others.

2326
01:16:31,530 --> 01:16:34,004
(A moment ago...)

2327
01:16:34,469 --> 01:16:38,584
(She was not swayed by any question.)

2328
01:16:39,070 --> 01:16:41,614
(Will she succeed again?)

2329
01:16:42,209 --> 01:16:44,154
(They're forming a plan.)

2330
01:16:45,810 --> 01:16:46,850
Why am I getting nervous?

2331
01:16:46,850 --> 01:16:48,824
Say a math formula you know.

2332
01:16:49,320 --> 01:16:50,725
- A math formula? - Yes.

2333
01:16:51,049 --> 01:16:52,719
(Her heart races.)

2334
01:16:52,719 --> 01:16:54,195
Say a math formula.

2335
01:16:54,389 --> 01:16:57,334
It's over! Nice!

2336
01:16:57,560 --> 01:16:59,389
- You shouldn't have done that. - Why?

2337
01:16:59,389 --> 01:17:01,360
- She's real. - Okay.

2338
01:17:01,360 --> 01:17:04,100
I said I liked math on radios.

2339
01:17:04,100 --> 01:17:05,400
- I know. - You got caught.

2340
01:17:05,400 --> 01:17:06,574
- What now? - Get back.

2341
01:17:06,600 --> 01:17:08,515
One more time. Something else.

2342
01:17:08,839 --> 01:17:10,975
Tell us three charms you have.

2343
01:17:12,570 --> 01:17:14,139
(3 charms are simple.)

2344
01:17:14,139 --> 01:17:15,815
- Be honest. - Be honest.

2345
01:17:16,179 --> 01:17:19,049
- Go. - Are you confident about your face?

2346
01:17:19,049 --> 01:17:20,480
- Already? - Think about it.

2347
01:17:20,480 --> 01:17:21,549
- No. - Think.

2348
01:17:21,549 --> 01:17:23,324
- Charms. - Go down.

2349
01:17:23,350 --> 01:17:25,395
- Go down. - Just think about your charms.

2350
01:17:26,020 --> 01:17:28,034
(He doesn't understand.)

2351
01:17:28,860 --> 01:17:30,195
Don't you have any charms?

2352
01:17:31,190 --> 01:17:32,404
Don't you have any charms?

2353
01:17:32,490 --> 01:17:34,600
- Why is he mad? - Jae Seok.

2354
01:17:34,600 --> 01:17:36,475
Why did you get mad? We were talking about your charms.

2355
01:17:36,929 --> 01:17:39,204
- Hey, were you making fun of me? - No.

2356
01:17:40,270 --> 01:17:42,600
- We were just curious. - Just say your charms.

2357
01:17:42,600 --> 01:17:44,969
- Just say, "eyes, nose, and mouth". - Do you want to fight?

2358
01:17:44,969 --> 01:17:46,315
Why do you want to fight?

2359
01:17:46,709 --> 01:17:48,139
Goodness.

2360
01:17:48,139 --> 01:17:49,280
(The sad alien got mad while thinking about his charms.)

2361
01:17:49,280 --> 01:17:51,650
Good job, So Min. We're second place. Let's eat.

2362
01:17:51,650 --> 01:17:54,624
Se Chan and So Min take second place.

2363
01:17:55,480 --> 01:17:56,780
If you fail,

2364
01:17:56,780 --> 01:17:59,350
- Haha and Ye Won win. - Okay.

2365
01:17:59,350 --> 01:18:01,124
- Okay. - Are you calm?

2366
01:18:01,150 --> 01:18:02,560
- I'll press it. - Go.

2367
01:18:02,560 --> 01:18:03,889
(Can he maintain inner peace this time as well?)

2368
01:18:03,889 --> 01:18:05,289
- It's on. Go. - It won't be fun.

2369
01:18:05,289 --> 01:18:06,629
- Jong Kook. - Yes.

2370
01:18:06,629 --> 01:18:08,759
- I got hurt. - Don't get hurt.

2371
01:18:08,759 --> 01:18:10,030
- I'm serious. - Why?

2372
01:18:10,030 --> 01:18:11,600
- You're really mean. - No.

2373
01:18:11,600 --> 01:18:14,574
- You didn't choose me. - It was for fun.

2374
01:18:14,700 --> 01:18:15,999
(It rises all of a sudden.)

2375
01:18:15,999 --> 01:18:17,275
- You're mean. - What do you think about Ye Won?

2376
01:18:17,299 --> 01:18:18,509
It's going up.

2377
01:18:18,509 --> 01:18:20,070
Don't do it. No.

2378
01:18:20,070 --> 01:18:21,385
- Jong Kook. - Hurry.

2379
01:18:22,139 --> 01:18:24,509
What do you think about Ye Won? How is she as a partner?

2380
01:18:24,509 --> 01:18:26,355
- Think about the ocean. - She's great.

2381
01:18:26,709 --> 01:18:27,850
No, it's red!

2382
01:18:27,850 --> 01:18:29,654
What can you do for her?

2383
01:18:30,049 --> 01:18:32,725
(He fails to maintain inner peace.)

2384
01:18:32,820 --> 01:18:34,959
(They kept on attacking with questions about her.)

2385
01:18:34,959 --> 01:18:36,219
(Jong Kook caved in!)

2386
01:18:36,219 --> 01:18:38,060
We did it!

2387
01:18:38,060 --> 01:18:39,560
- This is weird. - We did it.

2388
01:18:39,560 --> 01:18:44,105
Why? Because your feelings were revealed?

2389
01:18:45,329 --> 01:18:46,600
(Teasing is fun.)

2390
01:18:46,600 --> 01:18:50,175
He likes her

2391
01:18:50,570 --> 01:18:52,445
Does your heart pound?

2392
01:18:53,110 --> 01:18:55,084
Does this flutter?

2393
01:18:55,709 --> 01:18:57,079
Does it pound?

2394
01:18:57,079 --> 01:18:58,810
Change my partner.

2395
01:18:58,810 --> 01:19:00,450
- Hold on. - Oh, gosh.

2396
01:19:00,450 --> 01:19:02,120
- I'm curious. - I tried my best.

2397
01:19:02,120 --> 01:19:03,494
- I'm loyal. - Goodness.

2398
01:19:03,520 --> 01:19:05,864
The winning couple for Inner Peace Traffic Light is...

2399
01:19:05,950 --> 01:19:07,589
Haha and Ye Won.

2400
01:19:07,589 --> 01:19:08,664
(Haha and Ye Won are winners of Inner Peace Traffic Light.)

2401
01:19:08,719 --> 01:19:13,004
You two get hints about the prophet...

2402
01:19:13,030 --> 01:19:15,030
- and the deity of light. - The prophet hint is good.

2403
01:19:15,030 --> 01:19:16,230
What's the hint on the deity of light?

2404
01:19:16,230 --> 01:19:17,400
- I'm hungry. - Let's eat.

2405
01:19:17,400 --> 01:19:18,530
Okay.

2406
01:19:18,530 --> 01:19:20,329
(Will they get ideas about the three identities?)

2407
01:19:20,329 --> 01:19:21,469
What's this?

2408
01:19:21,469 --> 01:19:23,639
(People with the same name are not the prophet.)

2409
01:19:23,639 --> 01:19:25,845
(This excludes Kim Ye Won, Jang Ye Won)

2410
01:19:26,169 --> 01:19:28,614
(Kwang Soo and SUNMI received the same hint.)

2411
01:19:29,410 --> 01:19:31,079
(Neither Kim Ye Won nor Jang Ye Won is the prophet.)

2412
01:19:31,079 --> 01:19:32,754
This one is on the deity of light.

2413
01:19:33,209 --> 01:19:35,154
- Really? - There's more?

2414
01:19:35,280 --> 01:19:36,595
Why are there so many?

2415
01:19:37,350 --> 01:19:39,719
(The youngest Running Man member, Se Chan, is not the deity of light.)

2416
01:19:39,719 --> 01:19:40,850
Share it.

2417
01:19:40,850 --> 01:19:42,695
They're giving lots of hints.

2418
01:19:42,990 --> 01:19:44,629
(They check the hint on the deity of light again.)

2419
01:19:44,629 --> 01:19:45,629
This is weird.

2420
01:19:45,629 --> 01:19:47,735
SUNMI, you'll share it with us, right?

2421
01:19:47,959 --> 01:19:49,629
There's no reason not to.

2422
01:19:49,629 --> 01:19:50,860
- This is weird. - You have to share it.

2423
01:19:50,860 --> 01:19:52,275
I don't think we should.

2424
01:19:52,870 --> 01:19:53,975
Okay.

2425
01:19:53,999 --> 01:19:55,999
Check if there's a picture. Can they hold on to that one too?

2426
01:19:55,999 --> 01:19:58,539
Hold on. Can we check the back?

2427
01:19:58,539 --> 01:19:59,709
You can do whatever you want.

2428
01:19:59,770 --> 01:20:00,770
It's one of us.

2429
01:20:00,770 --> 01:20:03,015
- Let's play rock-paper-scissors. - If you don't share it with us...

2430
01:20:03,179 --> 01:20:04,685
- Share the hint with us. - What?

2431
01:20:06,310 --> 01:20:07,454
Is there something else?

2432
01:20:07,950 --> 01:20:09,749
(This time, there's a different photo.)

2433
01:20:09,749 --> 01:20:12,794
(Blue Ocean in the Middle of the Afternoon)

2434
01:20:13,450 --> 01:20:14,589
Hold on to it.

2435
01:20:14,589 --> 01:20:15,895
Do we need to share this with others?

2436
01:20:16,190 --> 01:20:17,635
- Listen. - He'll tell us.

2437
01:20:18,829 --> 01:20:21,105
We can't share the hint right now.

2438
01:20:21,799 --> 01:20:24,400
- We can't share it now. - But...

2439
01:20:24,400 --> 01:20:26,070
- It's someone... - Yes.

2440
01:20:26,070 --> 01:20:27,900
- It's someone among us. - There's an odd part in the hint.

2441
01:20:27,900 --> 01:20:29,145
- Really? - Yes.

2442
01:20:29,570 --> 01:20:30,570
Okay.

2443
01:20:30,570 --> 01:20:32,839
(A secret is hidden in the photo.)

2444
01:20:32,839 --> 01:20:35,185
(Is that related to the deity of darkness?)

2445
01:20:35,509 --> 01:20:38,485
(The race starts. They must find and eliminate the deity of darkness.)

2446
01:20:38,610 --> 01:20:42,055
(Suspicious behaviors are slowly unraveled.)

2447
01:20:42,579 --> 01:20:44,350
(They give suspicious answers about their whereabouts.)

2448
01:20:44,350 --> 01:20:45,664
(I have nothing to hide, you know.)

2449
01:20:45,789 --> 01:20:48,160
(In the end, they must search the building thoroughly...)

2450
01:20:48,160 --> 01:20:50,259
(and find the decisive hint about the deity.)

2451
01:20:50,259 --> 01:20:51,789
(At that moment, she finds the hint.)

2452
01:20:51,789 --> 01:20:53,459
(And she's discrediting it.)

2453
01:20:53,459 --> 01:20:56,034
(Light versus darkness, which one will be the final victor?)

2454
01:20:56,060 --> 01:20:57,959
(And the D-Day has come.)

2455
01:20:57,959 --> 01:21:00,499
I'd like to thank everyone who has come...

2456
01:21:00,499 --> 01:21:04,044
(For fans who have supported the show for 9 years,)

2457
01:21:04,169 --> 01:21:06,284
(the members set out on a long journey of 100 days.)

2458
01:21:06,709 --> 01:21:08,910
(Their goal was to hold a fan-meet in Korea which was unprecedented.)

2459
01:21:08,910 --> 01:21:10,440
(They made the merchandise, wrote the theme song,)

2460
01:21:10,440 --> 01:21:12,084
(practiced the group dance, and worked with other singers.)

2461
01:21:12,650 --> 01:21:15,954
(They have spent all this time for this day.)

2462
01:21:16,520 --> 01:21:19,494
(It's the promise the members made...)

2463
01:21:19,549 --> 01:21:21,889
(for the love their fans gave them for the past 9 years...)

2464
01:21:21,889 --> 01:21:23,690
(to make sure they return the favor to the fans.)

2465
01:21:23,690 --> 01:21:25,560
- Yes! - Yes!

2466
01:21:25,560 --> 01:21:29,374
(It's the first race the members will have with the fans.)

2467
01:21:30,160 --> 01:21:32,730
(The splendid fan-meet begins.)

2468
01:21:32,730 --> 01:21:36,145
