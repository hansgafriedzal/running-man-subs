00:00:05,480 --> 00:00:08,780
Don't walk, run! This is Running Man. Hello, viewers.

2
00:00:08,787 --> 00:00:09,919
(Running Man has been airing for 9 years without a break.)

3
00:00:10,089 --> 00:00:13,458
(So many of the fans have supported the members of Running Man.)

4
00:00:13,528 --> 00:00:16,529
(We have prepared this special episode to repay their support.)

5
00:00:16,698 --> 00:00:18,999
(The very first fan-meet in Korea, Running Man's Fan-Meet)

6
00:00:19,569 --> 00:00:21,537
(Opening song by all 8 members)

7
00:00:21,538 --> 00:00:25,768
(The opening song by the members was about gratitude for the fans.)

8
00:00:25,769 --> 00:00:27,608
(Seok Jin and Ji Hyo showed nice chemistry unexpectedly.)

9
00:00:27,609 --> 00:00:29,878
(And Jong Kook put on an amazing performance as expected.)

10
00:00:30,008 --> 00:00:31,577
(The 3 youngest members brought things back to the 1990s.)

11
00:00:31,578 --> 00:00:33,308
(Jae Seok and Haha put on a performance as a pair too.)

12
00:00:33,309 --> 00:00:34,978
(Joint performances with musicians)

13
00:00:35,048 --> 00:00:37,419
(And here are the performances to come.)

14
00:00:37,849 --> 00:00:40,989
(At last, the final episode of the fan-meet special will air.)

15
00:00:41,188 --> 00:00:44,158
(The joint performances have been hidden away from the viewers.)

16
00:00:45,088 --> 00:00:48,328
(And the highlight of the fan-meet, the group choreography)

17
00:00:50,499 --> 00:00:53,968
(And the theme song, "I Like You" which was written after 9 years)

18
00:00:54,139 --> 00:00:58,169
(Sadly, this is the last story of Running Man's fan-meet.)

19
00:00:58,268 --> 00:01:01,209
(The members went on a long journey of 100 days for the fan-meet.)

20
00:01:01,838 --> 00:01:05,009
(The race starts!)

21
00:01:06,410 --> 00:01:07,539
"There is..."

22
00:01:07,949 --> 00:01:10,589
(There is a spy among you today.)

23
00:01:10,649 --> 00:01:14,220
We asked the spy to be the most passionate today.

24
00:01:14,274 --> 00:01:16,487
(The audience already knows who the spy is.)

25
00:01:16,488 --> 00:01:17,958
(There are hints?)

26
00:01:18,928 --> 00:01:21,758
(When the members finish their performance,)

27
00:01:21,759 --> 00:01:24,529
(if the cheer from the audience is over 120dB, they get a hint.)

28
00:01:25,568 --> 00:01:28,937
(Here are the hints obtained after the cheer reached 120dB.)

29
00:01:28,938 --> 00:01:29,938
(The spy likes cafes but not restaurants.)

30
00:01:30,369 --> 00:01:32,109
(Who on earth is the spy?)

31
00:01:33,139 --> 00:01:36,009
(Who is the spy?)

32
00:01:37,449 --> 00:01:40,978
(After Pink Nose Light's turn, it's Hyo Chan Park's turn.)

33
00:01:40,979 --> 00:01:44,119
(I heard that somebody incredible is coming.)

34
00:01:44,249 --> 00:01:46,048
(Who is it?)

35
00:01:46,649 --> 00:01:50,559
(Who is this incredible secret weapon from Hyo Chan Park?)

36
00:01:50,589 --> 00:01:53,428
(As their curiosity about the secret weapon is intensifying,)

37
00:01:53,610 --> 00:01:57,115
(Nucksal and Code Kunst's entrance to the stage excites them.)

38
00:01:57,680 --> 00:01:59,484
(Looking totally relaxed)

39
00:02:00,109 --> 00:02:01,809
(Just by entering, they can dominate the stage.)

40
00:02:01,810 --> 00:02:04,954
(Dazzling aura)

41
00:02:06,250 --> 00:02:07,464
Nucksal.

42
00:02:07,619 --> 00:02:10,435
Gosh, they look cool. They look so cool.

43
00:02:11,319 --> 00:02:12,519
Are you ready to have fun?

44
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:14,234
- Yes! - Yes!

45
00:02:15,229 --> 00:02:19,004
(They're professionals who have participated in TV competitions.)

46
00:02:19,929 --> 00:02:22,675
(Meanwhile, he's a rookie who is not relaxed at all.)

47
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:26,474
(Utterly nervous)

48
00:02:27,539 --> 00:02:29,955
(The video plays before the performance.)

49
00:02:30,679 --> 00:02:32,208
(Will the video tell us who the secret weapon is?)

50
00:02:32,209 --> 00:02:33,824
(Ji Hyo is pretty today as always.)

51
00:02:33,950 --> 00:02:35,608
(Song Ji Hyo)

52
00:02:35,609 --> 00:02:37,218
(Yang Se Chan)

53
00:02:37,219 --> 00:02:41,595
(Hyo Chan Park, 9 Years of Running Man)

54
00:02:42,789 --> 00:02:44,665
Hey, we're going to start recording now.

55
00:02:44,959 --> 00:02:45,958
(They are nervous to record the song.)

56
00:02:45,959 --> 00:02:47,235
Darn it.

57
00:02:47,289 --> 00:02:49,104
(Letting out a deep breath)

58
00:02:49,759 --> 00:02:51,799
I don't t think you're ready. You're only pretending to be.

59
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:54,205
Why would you be nervous?

60
00:02:54,630 --> 00:02:55,805
Let's see.

61
00:02:56,429 --> 00:02:59,139
Before we record, let's listen to the guide track.

62
00:02:59,140 --> 00:03:00,939
- And we'll record next. - Okay.

63
00:03:00,940 --> 00:03:04,678
Dr. Co will be the main director of today's recording.

64
00:03:04,679 --> 00:03:07,609
- I'm very strict. - He is. So be careful today.

65
00:03:07,610 --> 00:03:09,779
No matter how good you are, I'll reject the first three tries.

66
00:03:09,780 --> 00:03:11,554
(Warning in advance)

67
00:03:11,750 --> 00:03:13,849
(Trembling in fear)

68
00:03:13,850 --> 00:03:15,989
Okay. I should mess up the first three tries.

69
00:03:15,990 --> 00:03:17,489
(I should mess up the first 3 tries.)

70
00:03:17,490 --> 00:03:19,595
(You'll do what?)

71
00:03:19,819 --> 00:03:21,159
(Unintelligible singing)

72
00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:24,228
- Fine. I'll say, "Okay. Come out." - "Let me do it again."

73
00:03:24,229 --> 00:03:26,258
(Then the project will be halted right away.)

74
00:03:26,259 --> 00:03:27,769
"Let me do it again. I didn't start yet."

75
00:03:27,770 --> 00:03:28,799
First, let's start recording.

76
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:31,045
- Se Chan, go inside. - Okay.

77
00:03:31,339 --> 00:03:32,398
Se Chan will go in.

78
00:03:32,399 --> 00:03:33,485
(Se Chan will go in first.)

79
00:03:33,539 --> 00:03:34,538
Okay.

80
00:03:34,539 --> 00:03:36,409
(He clears his throat and starts recording.)

81
00:03:36,410 --> 00:03:38,379
Pump up the volume, get excited

82
00:03:38,380 --> 00:03:39,609
Why is this beeping?

83
00:03:39,610 --> 00:03:40,948
(Why is this beeping?)

84
00:03:40,949 --> 00:03:42,379
Why is that beeping? It happened the other day too.

85
00:03:42,380 --> 00:03:44,455
Was that arrogant of me? Should I ignore it and keep going?

86
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:46,219
- No, no. You're right. - I'll just do it. I'm sorry.

87
00:03:46,220 --> 00:03:47,318
- No. - You're right.

88
00:03:47,319 --> 00:03:48,519
Or the microphone might be rejecting you.

89
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:50,019
Or you might be getting electrocuted.

90
00:03:50,020 --> 00:03:52,519
(Dr. Co sounds strict, and Nucksal is joking.)

91
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:54,235
- I should be careful then. - Electrocuted?

92
00:03:55,589 --> 00:03:58,529
- He's high-maintenance. - He's getting annoying now.

93
00:03:58,530 --> 00:03:59,605
(Teasing again)

94
00:04:13,350 --> 00:04:15,209
Hey, Se Chan is pretty good.

95
00:04:15,210 --> 00:04:16,978
- He's really good. - He's good.

96
00:04:16,979 --> 00:04:18,418
- The Gang approves you. - You were good.

97
00:04:18,419 --> 00:04:19,988
- Okay. Great. Do it just like that. - Okay.

98
00:04:19,989 --> 00:04:21,018
Okay.

99
00:04:21,019 --> 00:04:22,048
(Ji Hyo starts recording next.)

100
00:04:22,049 --> 00:04:23,165
I'm nervous.

101
00:04:23,419 --> 00:04:25,258
- All right. - She's nervous.

102
00:04:25,259 --> 00:04:26,464
We'll start now.

103
00:04:27,430 --> 00:04:29,165
Don't forget you're a rapper now.

104
00:04:29,530 --> 00:04:30,705
I'm a rapper.

105
00:04:31,530 --> 00:04:32,705
Yes.

106
00:04:37,900 --> 00:04:41,538
(Messing up the lyrics)

107
00:04:41,539 --> 00:04:43,108
Beautiful memories

108
00:04:43,109 --> 00:04:44,785
Turn it off.

109
00:04:45,210 --> 00:04:46,309
(The instrumental is turned off.)

110
00:04:46,310 --> 00:04:47,749
Stop it.

111
00:04:47,750 --> 00:04:49,478
- This is getting annoying. - I'm sorry.

112
00:04:49,479 --> 00:04:52,418
You're really nervous, so your pitch is shaking.

113
00:04:52,419 --> 00:04:53,624
Oh, boy.

114
00:04:53,949 --> 00:04:57,934
(She starts recording again after preparing herself.)

115
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:00,505
(Looking serious)

116
00:05:00,930 --> 00:05:03,064
(His countenance grows stiff.)

117
00:05:03,130 --> 00:05:05,929
Her voice is shaking too much. Will that work? Let's hear it again.

118
00:05:05,930 --> 00:05:08,274
- Okay. Let's try a few more times. - Yes.

119
00:05:08,829 --> 00:05:12,214
(Ji Hyo keeps recording again and again.)

120
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:14,168
Ji Hyo, you're doing great.

121
00:05:14,169 --> 00:05:15,339
Do I just keep doing what I've been doing?

122
00:05:15,340 --> 00:05:17,038
But you're nervous, so your voice is shaking.

123
00:05:17,039 --> 00:05:18,508
Or do you want to do it sitting down?

124
00:05:18,509 --> 00:05:20,409
- No. Standing up will be better. - Some people sit down and do it.

125
00:05:20,410 --> 00:05:21,849
- Okay. All right then. - I'll try.

126
00:05:21,850 --> 00:05:22,948
- Take your time, Ji Hyo. - Okay.

127
00:05:22,949 --> 00:05:24,094
You're doing great.

128
00:05:24,220 --> 00:05:26,964
Ji Hyo, don't worry. Just be yourself.

129
00:05:27,049 --> 00:05:28,564
We have a lot of time.

130
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:32,295
(Will she overcome her nervousness on stage?)

131
00:05:33,220 --> 00:05:36,404
(She's been preparing for 3 months for these next 3 minutes on stage.)

132
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:38,475
(Feeling nervous)

133
00:05:39,030 --> 00:05:40,029
(3 singers are watching the clips.)

134
00:05:40,030 --> 00:05:42,105
My gosh, look at their faces.

135
00:05:43,739 --> 00:05:46,045
(Don't be nervous, and go for it!)

136
00:05:47,069 --> 00:05:51,084
(Hyo Chan Park's performance with the incredible secret weapon)

137
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:54,849
("Bonjour, Hi" by Hyo Chan Park)

138
00:05:54,850 --> 00:06:00,024
(The heart-fluttering feeling before entering a club unfolds in notes.)

139
00:06:00,220 --> 00:06:01,388
(Hyo Chan Park)

140
00:06:01,389 --> 00:06:02,418
(Let's get it!)

141
00:06:02,419 --> 00:06:04,619
Ji Hyo, Se Chan, and Code Kunst.

142
00:06:04,620 --> 00:06:07,388
(They prepared a park where people can have fun at.)

143
00:06:07,389 --> 00:06:08,429
At last.

144
00:06:08,430 --> 00:06:09,704
(Looking forward to their performance)

145
00:06:19,499 --> 00:06:23,085
(The decibels are slowly going up too.)

146
00:06:23,780 --> 00:06:26,684
(Se Chan is fully ready to enter the stage now.)

147
00:06:27,080 --> 00:06:29,108
(Get ready, Se Chan will start now.)

148
00:06:29,109 --> 00:06:33,564
(Se Chan enters with full of swag without any hint of nervousness.)

149
00:06:40,789 --> 00:06:42,759
(My gosh, he's really good!)

150
00:06:42,760 --> 00:06:44,304
(Muscular swag)

151
00:06:44,760 --> 00:06:45,858
(His perfect rapping impresses them.)

152
00:06:45,859 --> 00:06:47,045
He's cute.

153
00:06:57,679 --> 00:07:00,308
(The lyrics with perfect rhymes written by Se Chan himself)

154
00:07:00,309 --> 00:07:02,225
(This is so exciting!)

155
00:07:12,390 --> 00:07:14,488
(This catchy chorus makes the audience sing along.)

156
00:07:14,489 --> 00:07:17,035
(Bonjour, hi)

157
00:07:21,700 --> 00:07:26,399
(Hyo Chan Park wanted to have fun with the fans together.)

158
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:30,254
(The decibels for "Bonjour, Hi" are pretty high.)

159
00:07:30,780 --> 00:07:32,538
(When everyone is enjoying the show,)

160
00:07:32,539 --> 00:07:36,454
(the identity of the secret weapon is becoming a bigger mystery.)

161
00:07:56,970 --> 00:07:58,769
(Se Chan has been rapping furiously.)

162
00:07:58,770 --> 00:08:01,438
(And he points somewhere.)

163
00:08:01,439 --> 00:08:02,738
(Surprised!)

164
00:08:02,739 --> 00:08:04,684
(It's Ji Hyo!)

165
00:08:05,210 --> 00:08:09,178
(The audience who's been grooving looks at something.)

166
00:08:09,179 --> 00:08:11,454
(Surprised)

167
00:08:12,580 --> 00:08:14,694
(Everyone's eyes are fixated on the left.)

168
00:08:14,919 --> 00:08:18,819
(While grabbing everyone's attention,)

169
00:08:18,820 --> 00:08:22,465
(Ji Hyo shows up on the lift.)

170
00:08:27,499 --> 00:08:28,905
She looks so cool.

171
00:08:29,470 --> 00:08:31,014
The lift was a great idea.

172
00:08:31,499 --> 00:08:34,069
(They are impressed and proud of Ji Hyo's perfect entrance.)

173
00:08:34,070 --> 00:08:35,184
- Gosh. - She's good.

174
00:08:41,109 --> 00:08:44,124
(Ji Hyo wrote the lyrics herself while looking back on her 9 years.)

175
00:08:51,390 --> 00:08:53,035
Scream, everyone!

176
00:08:53,090 --> 00:08:57,628
(Her sincere lyrics excite the audience even more.)

177
00:08:57,629 --> 00:09:00,345
(When the atmosphere is reaching its peak,)

178
00:09:00,770 --> 00:09:03,938
(the mysterious secret weapon shows up.)

179
00:09:03,939 --> 00:09:05,498
(No way!)

180
00:09:05,499 --> 00:09:07,608
(I can't believe this!)

181
00:09:07,609 --> 00:09:10,514
(I can't believe I'm seeing this rapper in person.)

182
00:09:11,179 --> 00:09:14,454
(The secret weapon that made everyone's jaws drop)

183
00:09:15,479 --> 00:09:18,918
(The rapper that entered the stage amid the fervent cheer is...)

184
00:09:18,919 --> 00:09:20,389
(Am I dreaming? Is this really happening?)

185
00:09:20,390 --> 00:09:21,764
(Unable to talk)

186
00:09:22,220 --> 00:09:26,134
(The secret weapon Hyo Chan Park has been hiding is...)

187
00:09:27,359 --> 00:09:28,728
(the best female rapper in Korea.)

188
00:09:28,729 --> 00:09:31,804
(The queen of hip-hop artists, Yoon Mi Rae)

189
00:09:32,260 --> 00:09:35,944
(Yoon Mi Rae was the secret weapon!)

190
00:09:36,900 --> 00:09:38,199
(Even the members didn't know about it.)

191
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:40,614
- Tasha! - Hey.

192
00:09:40,869 --> 00:09:42,014
T.

193
00:09:43,039 --> 00:09:46,014
(With her entrance, the audience's cheer is the loudest.)

194
00:09:47,150 --> 00:09:48,449
(The queen of hip-hop artists rule the stage by her mere presence.)

195
00:09:48,450 --> 00:09:50,525
This is Yoon Mi Rae!

196
00:10:14,910 --> 00:10:19,808
(The performance is at its climax with its catchy melody and Mi Rae.)

197
00:10:19,809 --> 00:10:23,624
(Everyone, put your hands up!)

198
00:10:33,119 --> 00:10:34,535
One more time.

199
00:10:34,759 --> 00:10:37,128
Running Man!

200
00:10:37,129 --> 00:10:39,429
("Bonjour, Hi" by Hyo Chan Park with Yoon Mi Rae)

201
00:10:39,430 --> 00:10:42,104
(Their performance calls for amazement.)

202
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:43,299
(That was the best!)

203
00:10:43,300 --> 00:10:45,699
Hyo Chan Park! My gosh, that was so cool.

204
00:10:45,700 --> 00:10:47,669
Hey, Yoon Mi Rae!

205
00:10:47,670 --> 00:10:49,814
- Make some noise! - Thank you.

206
00:10:52,940 --> 00:10:57,248
(Mi Rae's singing made an already perfect performance more perfect.)

207
00:10:57,249 --> 00:10:58,378
Hello, everyone.

208
00:10:58,379 --> 00:11:00,079
We're Hyo Chan Park. Nice to meet you.

209
00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:01,365
- Nice to meet you. - Nice to meet you.

210
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:03,464
(Your performance was so good!)

211
00:11:03,690 --> 00:11:06,064
Hello. I'm Yoon Mi Rae. Nice to meet you.

212
00:11:07,229 --> 00:11:09,559
(We should be saying that to you!)

213
00:11:09,560 --> 00:11:11,804
(Fervent welcome)

214
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:14,128
(Thank you for the warm welcome.)

215
00:11:14,129 --> 00:11:17,074
Mi Rae was our secret weapon.

216
00:11:17,300 --> 00:11:18,969
So she joined us as a surprise.

217
00:11:18,970 --> 00:11:20,844
Right. Thank you for inviting me.

218
00:11:21,009 --> 00:11:22,969
How was it? Please tell us how it was.

219
00:11:22,970 --> 00:11:24,115
I wanted...

220
00:11:24,680 --> 00:11:26,285
to do a good job.

221
00:11:27,050 --> 00:11:28,724
- You were amazing! - I'm sorry.

222
00:11:28,909 --> 00:11:30,919
- Everyone did great. - You were great.

223
00:11:30,920 --> 00:11:32,295
By the way, you were so good.

224
00:11:32,420 --> 00:11:33,748
Thank you.

225
00:11:33,749 --> 00:11:36,888
And your outfit looks really good on you. You look cool.

226
00:11:36,889 --> 00:11:38,559
- This is all Code Kunst. - My gosh.

227
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:40,488
The song was great too.

228
00:11:40,489 --> 00:11:42,135
- Thank you. - I...

229
00:11:42,359 --> 00:11:44,358
I should've done better. I'm sorry.

230
00:11:44,359 --> 00:11:46,728
(I should've done better. I'm sorry.)

231
00:11:46,729 --> 00:11:48,368
(She ends her conversation with an apology.)

232
00:11:48,369 --> 00:11:49,444
Seriously.

233
00:11:50,170 --> 00:11:52,574
But thank you so much for having me today.

234
00:11:52,639 --> 00:11:55,768
I'll do a better job if you give me another chance.

235
00:11:55,769 --> 00:11:57,108
Please give her a round of applause.

236
00:11:57,109 --> 00:11:58,184
Thank you.

237
00:11:58,210 --> 00:11:59,738
- Have a wonderful time. - Okay.

238
00:11:59,739 --> 00:12:01,549
We have another performance coming up next.

239
00:12:01,550 --> 00:12:03,278
Please enjoy the show until the end.

240
00:12:03,279 --> 00:12:06,694
- Thank you! - Thank you!

241
00:12:06,749 --> 00:12:07,919
Be happy.

242
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:11,518
(The second joint performance that excited everyone is over.)

243
00:12:11,519 --> 00:12:13,719
(We had so much fun!)

244
00:12:13,720 --> 00:12:15,358
- It was so fun. You were so good. - My gosh.

245
00:12:15,359 --> 00:12:17,099
(They are satisfied with their perfect performance.)

246
00:12:17,100 --> 00:12:18,304
Thank you.

247
00:12:18,399 --> 00:12:19,505
Thank you.

248
00:12:19,930 --> 00:12:21,028
- Mi Rae. - Thank you!

249
00:12:21,029 --> 00:12:22,768
I'll call you later. I'll treat you.

250
00:12:22,769 --> 00:12:24,675
- Whenever. - Thank you.

251
00:12:24,700 --> 00:12:26,814
- See you next time. - Great job today!

252
00:12:26,999 --> 00:12:28,908
- Well done. - Our eyes met, right?

253
00:12:28,909 --> 00:12:30,508
Hey, we did great. Seriously.

254
00:12:30,509 --> 00:12:32,778
- We did well. - We did well.

255
00:12:32,779 --> 00:12:34,285
- We did well. - Did we go over the number?

256
00:12:34,450 --> 00:12:37,224
Yes, the decibels of Hyo Chan Park...

257
00:12:37,450 --> 00:12:40,118
(They got the audience to sing along.)

258
00:12:40,119 --> 00:12:42,388
(And they even utilized a secret weapon, Yoon Mi Rae.)

259
00:12:42,389 --> 00:12:44,258
(Did they go over 120dB?)

260
00:12:44,259 --> 00:12:46,895
- It's 124. - My gosh.

261
00:12:47,129 --> 00:12:48,665
- You accomplished your mission. - My gosh.

262
00:12:48,690 --> 00:12:50,158
- There was a mission? - You can choose...

263
00:12:50,159 --> 00:12:51,799
- 1 of these 3 hints. - Code Kunst, you should choose.

264
00:12:51,800 --> 00:12:53,528
- Okay. - Code Kunst, pick one.

265
00:12:53,529 --> 00:12:55,405
- This one. - This hint is important.

266
00:12:55,729 --> 00:12:57,069
- Give it to Se Chan. - Can I read it?

267
00:12:57,070 --> 00:12:58,175
- Yes. - Yes.

268
00:12:58,470 --> 00:13:00,069
(The spy was lucky today.)

269
00:13:00,070 --> 00:13:01,439
"The spy was lucky today"?

270
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:03,138
(The spy was lucky today?)

271
00:13:03,139 --> 00:13:04,484
- The spy got lucky today? - So...

272
00:13:04,509 --> 00:13:05,778
Could that be it?

273
00:13:05,779 --> 00:13:09,878
Jae Seok and Haha didn't get lucky, so they did the penalty.

274
00:13:09,879 --> 00:13:13,219
Does that mean Jae Seok and Haha can't be the spy? Is that possible?

275
00:13:13,220 --> 00:13:15,689
Okay. I got it. Let's go and try to figure it out.

276
00:13:15,690 --> 00:13:17,464
- This is giving me a headache. - This is crazy.

277
00:13:17,489 --> 00:13:18,858
- Anyway, - I just...

278
00:13:18,859 --> 00:13:20,929
- We did well. - Hyo Chan Park's "Bonjour, Hi"...

279
00:13:20,930 --> 00:13:24,059
(Hyo Chan Park's "Bonjour, Hi" was amazing!)

280
00:13:24,060 --> 00:13:26,059
(We did so well.)

281
00:13:26,060 --> 00:13:28,045
- I'm in such a good mood. - Let's go.

282
00:13:29,830 --> 00:13:30,969
Say, "Ho"!

283
00:13:30,970 --> 00:13:32,775
(When the audience is hyped up after Hyo Chan Park's performance,)

284
00:13:33,070 --> 00:13:35,608
(Kwang Soo and Seok Jin show up,)

285
00:13:35,609 --> 00:13:37,608
(encouraging people to participate with a hip-hop style cheer.)

286
00:13:37,609 --> 00:13:38,785
Ho, ho, ho.

287
00:13:39,009 --> 00:13:40,039
(Ho, ho, ho!)

288
00:13:40,040 --> 00:13:42,324
- Thank you. - Thank you so much.

289
00:13:42,609 --> 00:13:44,919
Seriously. We can't calm the excitement in here.

290
00:13:44,920 --> 00:13:46,125
I mean it.

291
00:13:46,149 --> 00:13:50,089
We're more excited by how excited you are.

292
00:13:50,090 --> 00:13:51,189
(The next group will continue with this excitement.)

293
00:13:51,190 --> 00:13:52,665
Anyway, next up is...

294
00:13:52,960 --> 00:13:55,505
Jae Seok...

295
00:13:56,060 --> 00:13:58,005
(My gosh, it's Jae Seok.)

296
00:13:58,359 --> 00:13:59,905
- So Min. - And...

297
00:14:01,369 --> 00:14:05,099
(If these two are performing, it must be with SORAN!)

298
00:14:05,100 --> 00:14:06,268
That's right. It's SORAN.

299
00:14:06,269 --> 00:14:09,745
(The third group is Team SORAN.)

300
00:14:10,310 --> 00:14:11,915
- Let's do a cheer, Jae Seok. - Okay.

301
00:14:12,210 --> 00:14:13,679
- Gather around. - Let's do it.

302
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:15,778
- 1, 2, 3. Let's go! - Let's go!

303
00:14:15,779 --> 00:14:17,184
(Let's go!)

304
00:14:17,249 --> 00:14:20,895
Please welcome Team SORAN with a big round of applause!

305
00:14:24,690 --> 00:14:26,419
(SORAN)

306
00:14:26,420 --> 00:14:27,829
(Jeon So Min)

307
00:14:27,830 --> 00:14:29,559
(Yu Jae Seok)

308
00:14:29,560 --> 00:14:34,375
(Jeon SORAN and Yu Jae Seok, 9 Years of Running Man)

309
00:14:34,430 --> 00:14:36,498
(17 days before the fan-meet)

310
00:14:36,499 --> 00:14:38,339
All right.

311
00:14:38,340 --> 00:14:41,385
Today, we'll be recording the song.

312
00:14:41,540 --> 00:14:42,714
All of a sudden,

313
00:14:43,239 --> 00:14:44,484
we're here.

314
00:14:45,109 --> 00:14:47,108
You listened to the song.

315
00:14:47,109 --> 00:14:48,579
- Yes, we did. - How is it for you?

316
00:14:48,580 --> 00:14:49,984
I like the song.

317
00:14:50,009 --> 00:14:51,255
Seriously.

318
00:14:51,320 --> 00:14:54,724
Under the strict supervision of Jae Seok,

319
00:14:55,420 --> 00:14:56,694
I fixed the song a lot.

320
00:14:57,119 --> 00:14:58,219
- These days, - He helped.

321
00:14:58,220 --> 00:15:00,365
I even sleep excitedly because you told me to make it exciting.

322
00:15:01,729 --> 00:15:05,398
("Make it more exciting. More exciting, Young Bae.)

323
00:15:05,399 --> 00:15:06,799
So how should I say this?

324
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:09,528
As a music enthusiast who loves music,

325
00:15:09,529 --> 00:15:12,839
I suggested making a song that the public would like more...

326
00:15:12,840 --> 00:15:14,515
to Young Bae.

327
00:15:14,609 --> 00:15:16,368
Young Bae gave it more thought.

328
00:15:16,369 --> 00:15:18,778
- That's how this song was born. - Yes, I love the song.

329
00:15:18,779 --> 00:15:19,908
He worked so hard.

330
00:15:19,909 --> 00:15:21,908
- Thank you so much. - I love the song.

331
00:15:21,909 --> 00:15:23,248
(This exciting song was made under Jae Seok's supervision.)

332
00:15:23,249 --> 00:15:24,579
I like everything.

333
00:15:24,580 --> 00:15:26,995
But the lyrics... How should I say it?

334
00:15:27,119 --> 00:15:29,648
(What's wrong with the lyrics?)

335
00:15:29,649 --> 00:15:32,589
I'm disappointed that I wasn't able...

336
00:15:32,590 --> 00:15:35,329
to participate in the lyric-writing session.

337
00:15:35,330 --> 00:15:36,934
- Right. - I had another filming that day.

338
00:15:36,989 --> 00:15:38,858
I'm sure you could have rescheduled, but you two...

339
00:15:38,859 --> 00:15:40,929
(I'm sure you could have rescheduled, but you two...)

340
00:15:40,930 --> 00:15:44,515
I thought about why you chose a day when I was unavailable.

341
00:15:44,700 --> 00:15:47,584
I realized that from the get-go, you guys wanted...

342
00:15:47,670 --> 00:15:49,309
to make me...

343
00:15:49,310 --> 00:15:50,738
a puppet.

344
00:15:50,739 --> 00:15:54,885
(You guys wanted to make me a puppet.)

345
00:15:55,409 --> 00:15:58,148
You took me in because you wanted to use me only on stage.

346
00:15:58,149 --> 00:15:59,549
- No, that's not true. - That crossed my mind.

347
00:15:59,550 --> 00:16:00,689
- That's not true. - Really?

348
00:16:00,690 --> 00:16:02,525
- We didn't plan it. - So...

349
00:16:02,550 --> 00:16:03,888
a name for the team came to my mind.

350
00:16:03,889 --> 00:16:05,395
It suits this situation perfectly.

351
00:16:06,290 --> 00:16:07,658
Jeon SORAN and Yu Jae Seok.

352
00:16:07,659 --> 00:16:09,689
(A perfect name, Jeon SORAN and Yu Jae Seok)

353
00:16:09,690 --> 00:16:11,675
- No. That's... - Hold on.

354
00:16:11,960 --> 00:16:13,059
"Jeon SORAN"?

355
00:16:13,060 --> 00:16:14,368
(And a guest singer, Yu Jae Seok)

356
00:16:14,369 --> 00:16:15,799
- From my observation, - I...

357
00:16:15,800 --> 00:16:19,015
it looks like the five of you will form a group.

358
00:16:20,369 --> 00:16:21,608
So Min, aren't you happy?

359
00:16:21,609 --> 00:16:22,908
- I'm so happy. - Right.

360
00:16:22,909 --> 00:16:24,508
(I'm so happy.)

361
00:16:24,509 --> 00:16:27,549
(So they decided on the name, Jeon SORAN and Yu Jae Seok.)

362
00:16:27,550 --> 00:16:30,084
Here's why I'm scared of these lyrics.

363
00:16:30,249 --> 00:16:31,419
- You know why, right? - Why is that?

364
00:16:31,420 --> 00:16:34,089
So Min told me a few stories about her past relationships.

365
00:16:34,090 --> 00:16:35,289
And they are in the song.

366
00:16:35,290 --> 00:16:39,694
(So Min's past relationships are in the song.)

367
00:16:39,759 --> 00:16:41,189
(Her parents are shocked.)

368
00:16:41,190 --> 00:16:45,234
I'm not just enjoying this music.

369
00:16:45,529 --> 00:16:48,944
I feel like I'm relaying her message to someone.

370
00:16:51,239 --> 00:16:54,309
I just wrote my thoughts.

371
00:16:54,310 --> 00:16:56,439
You asked me to write the lyrics,

372
00:16:56,440 --> 00:16:59,179
so I did.

373
00:16:59,180 --> 00:17:03,309
There was this guy whom I really liked.

374
00:17:03,310 --> 00:17:06,148
But he just wouldn't confess his feelings to me.

375
00:17:06,149 --> 00:17:08,488
It was obvious that he liked me,

376
00:17:08,489 --> 00:17:10,248
but he wouldn't say it.

377
00:17:10,249 --> 00:17:12,789
"Just say one thing. That's the only way I'd know."

378
00:17:12,790 --> 00:17:14,035
"Please say something."

379
00:17:14,259 --> 00:17:15,758
"Say that you love me or that you like me."

380
00:17:15,759 --> 00:17:18,299
"Forget about that. Just kiss me."

381
00:17:18,300 --> 00:17:21,628
(Forget about that. Just kiss me.)

382
00:17:21,629 --> 00:17:26,339
(Her straightforwardness is reflected in her lyrics.)

383
00:17:26,340 --> 00:17:29,515
She wrote this much.

384
00:17:29,540 --> 00:17:31,238
I wrote a lot.

385
00:17:31,239 --> 00:17:32,954
(The entire screen is filled up.)

386
00:17:33,340 --> 00:17:36,378
I'm relaying her message to someone.

387
00:17:36,379 --> 00:17:37,778
(Jae Seok and SORAN are her avatars.)

388
00:17:37,779 --> 00:17:39,694
I became afraid of her.

389
00:17:41,050 --> 00:17:44,219
(The truth behind the lyrics is finally revealed.)

390
00:17:44,220 --> 00:17:45,959
I understand her completely.

391
00:17:45,960 --> 00:17:47,665
But if you put that aside...

392
00:17:47,690 --> 00:17:49,628
and just read her lyrics,

393
00:17:49,629 --> 00:17:51,028
she is a genius.

394
00:17:51,029 --> 00:17:52,804
The people around me are shocked.

395
00:17:52,899 --> 00:17:57,199
I do understand that,

396
00:17:57,200 --> 00:18:00,238
but this part, "Do you want to kiss me?"

397
00:18:00,239 --> 00:18:01,738
(Her lyrics are very explicit.)

398
00:18:01,739 --> 00:18:02,809
- It's a bit... - You see,

399
00:18:02,810 --> 00:18:06,039
my mission is to make this song very popular...

400
00:18:06,040 --> 00:18:08,849
so that he'll have no choice but to confess his feelings.

401
00:18:08,850 --> 00:18:12,378
(So that he'll have no choice but to confess his feelings.)

402
00:18:12,379 --> 00:18:15,724
(We cheer for you.)

403
00:18:16,690 --> 00:18:18,358
(Did our daughter really write...)

404
00:18:18,359 --> 00:18:20,488
("Do you want to kiss me?")

405
00:18:20,489 --> 00:18:22,059
(Her love story is out in the open.)

406
00:18:22,060 --> 00:18:23,429
Do you get it?

407
00:18:23,430 --> 00:18:25,104
- So Min. - I'm going to torture him...

408
00:18:25,300 --> 00:18:28,469
- so that he'll have no choice. - "You just need to speak up."

409
00:18:28,470 --> 00:18:30,128
- I know. - "Just kiss me."

410
00:18:30,129 --> 00:18:32,238
What's your take on this?

411
00:18:32,239 --> 00:18:34,439
I think her lyrics are real...

412
00:18:34,440 --> 00:18:36,008
and sincere,

413
00:18:36,009 --> 00:18:37,309
- so I really like it. - Right?

414
00:18:37,310 --> 00:18:38,709
- It's energizing. - Isn't it nice?

415
00:18:38,710 --> 00:18:40,925
Imagine that you're the guy...

416
00:18:41,149 --> 00:18:42,978
in her lyrics.

417
00:18:42,979 --> 00:18:45,518
I'd be quite uncomfortable.

418
00:18:45,519 --> 00:18:48,118
(He sings a different tune.)

419
00:18:48,119 --> 00:18:49,549
(Her straightforward lyrics would make him uncomfortable.)

420
00:18:49,550 --> 00:18:51,518
Right? See?

421
00:18:51,519 --> 00:18:53,564
That's what I mean.

422
00:18:54,119 --> 00:18:55,505
So Min.

423
00:18:56,529 --> 00:18:58,675
- Let's record it. - All right.

424
00:18:59,399 --> 00:19:01,368
- Show us. - Good luck.

425
00:19:01,369 --> 00:19:03,628
- He's good. - No, I'm not.

426
00:19:03,629 --> 00:19:06,638
He's good. I saw him last time.

427
00:19:06,639 --> 00:19:07,744
- Really? - Yes.

428
00:19:08,969 --> 00:19:11,908
(What do you want to eat?)

429
00:19:11,909 --> 00:19:15,249
(I'll buy them for you)

430
00:19:15,250 --> 00:19:21,165
(The lyrics are based on her story and there's a cheerful melody.)

431
00:19:24,219 --> 00:19:27,964
(They like the song.)

432
00:19:28,459 --> 00:19:29,529
(Confess to me)

433
00:19:29,530 --> 00:19:30,958
(Just do it)

434
00:19:30,959 --> 00:19:32,529
(Say something)

435
00:19:32,530 --> 00:19:34,059
(You're driving me crazy)

436
00:19:34,060 --> 00:19:36,128
Confess to me, just do it

437
00:19:36,129 --> 00:19:40,944
(They burst into laughter at the lyrics.)

438
00:19:41,010 --> 00:19:42,915
They're laughing at the lyrics.

439
00:19:43,169 --> 00:19:44,438
(She's embarrassed.)

440
00:19:44,439 --> 00:19:46,638
- That was nice. - The end wasn't nice, right?

441
00:19:46,639 --> 00:19:48,849
- "Say something," was nice. - And "You're driving me crazy"?

442
00:19:48,850 --> 00:19:50,178
When you sing that...

443
00:19:50,179 --> 00:19:51,918
You're driving me crazy

444
00:19:51,919 --> 00:19:54,218
Act like it's really driving you...

445
00:19:54,219 --> 00:19:55,589
- crazy. - Okay, I got it.

446
00:19:55,590 --> 00:19:57,264
(He wants Jae Seok to show his emotions.)

447
00:19:58,020 --> 00:19:59,559
- Crazy. - Okay, I got it.

448
00:19:59,560 --> 00:20:00,658
Here we go.

449
00:20:00,659 --> 00:20:02,234
(Laughing)

450
00:20:02,429 --> 00:20:03,704
Here we go.

451
00:20:03,830 --> 00:20:06,658
(Their eyes meet.)

452
00:20:06,659 --> 00:20:08,529
- That's good. - Our eyes met,

453
00:20:08,530 --> 00:20:09,968
and I hated it.

454
00:20:09,969 --> 00:20:12,039
(Our eyes met, and I hated it.)

455
00:20:12,040 --> 00:20:14,075
- I like this. - and I hated it.

456
00:20:14,770 --> 00:20:17,339
- I hate this. - My story is being made.

457
00:20:17,340 --> 00:20:20,239
She looked so happy.

458
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:21,479
(He truly thinks that he's an avatar.)

459
00:20:21,480 --> 00:20:22,579
Give it another go.

460
00:20:22,580 --> 00:20:23,878
- Here we go. - Okay.

461
00:20:23,879 --> 00:20:25,079
(They resume the recording.)

462
00:20:25,080 --> 00:20:27,819
(After his powerful singing...)

463
00:20:27,820 --> 00:20:29,595
(Before this song is over)

464
00:20:31,020 --> 00:20:32,089
Try it again.

465
00:20:32,090 --> 00:20:33,188
(She puts in too much emotion.)

466
00:20:33,189 --> 00:20:34,605
It's too high-pitched.

467
00:20:36,260 --> 00:20:39,958
("Confess Already" by Jeon SORAN and Yu Jae Seok...)

468
00:20:39,959 --> 00:20:44,274
(is filled with So Min's innermost thoughts.)

469
00:20:44,469 --> 00:20:46,069
Race start.

470
00:20:46,070 --> 00:20:47,375
(The performance will be revealed now.)

471
00:20:49,040 --> 00:20:53,415
(SORAN appears.)

472
00:20:55,810 --> 00:20:58,118
(Drummer: Pyun Yoo Il, Bassist: Seo Myun Ho,)

473
00:20:58,119 --> 00:21:00,595
(Guitarist: Lee Tae Wook)

474
00:21:00,780 --> 00:21:03,589
(Jeon SORAN and Yu Jae Seok also appear.)

475
00:21:03,590 --> 00:21:06,194
(Ko Young Bae, Jeon So Min, Yu Jae Seok)

476
00:21:06,419 --> 00:21:08,534
- I'm looking forward to this. - I've been anticipating.

477
00:21:08,959 --> 00:21:12,029
(The fans cheer for them.)

478
00:21:12,030 --> 00:21:14,875
Should we tell them to stand up? Should we? All right.

479
00:21:15,500 --> 00:21:19,269
(Young Bae, an experienced singer, signals them to stand up.)

480
00:21:19,270 --> 00:21:22,968
(They listen to him.)

481
00:21:22,969 --> 00:21:26,339
(So Min's parents also stand up.)

482
00:21:26,340 --> 00:21:28,479
- Good luck! - Good luck!

483
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:30,085
They look laidback.

484
00:21:30,879 --> 00:21:33,319
(She tells the audience on the 2nd floor to stand up.)

485
00:21:33,320 --> 00:21:36,188
(Let's have fun together.)

486
00:21:36,189 --> 00:21:39,158
(Everyone is standing.)

487
00:21:39,159 --> 00:21:43,565
("Confess Already" by Jeon SORAN and Yu Jae Seok)

488
00:21:53,969 --> 00:21:58,339
(Confess already)

489
00:21:58,340 --> 00:21:59,678
They look so cute.

490
00:21:59,679 --> 00:22:00,885
(They look lovely and cute.)

491
00:22:01,449 --> 00:22:04,754
(They begin their performance by urging the confession.)

492
00:22:05,020 --> 00:22:08,825
(The band's performance complements the atmosphere.)

493
00:22:38,850 --> 00:22:40,849
(They show fantastic harmony.)

494
00:22:40,850 --> 00:22:43,365
Jae Seok looks like a band member.

495
00:22:43,919 --> 00:22:45,194
Right?

496
00:22:45,419 --> 00:22:50,835
(They show a harmonious ensemble, unlike their group name.)

497
00:22:54,330 --> 00:22:56,575
(Just kiss me)

498
00:22:57,230 --> 00:23:00,615
(Just kiss me)

499
00:23:01,469 --> 00:23:04,479
(The crowd gets louder thanks to her kiss.)

500
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:05,908
She's a natural.

501
00:23:05,909 --> 00:23:07,484
She's naturally cute.

502
00:23:17,859 --> 00:23:19,635
(Okay, I got it)

503
00:23:22,790 --> 00:23:25,734
(She's already singing along.)

504
00:23:25,959 --> 00:23:28,198
(Before this song is over)

505
00:23:28,199 --> 00:23:30,269
(He sings a high note.)

506
00:23:30,270 --> 00:23:32,044
He's good.

507
00:23:32,669 --> 00:23:36,714
(Before this song is over)

508
00:23:37,209 --> 00:23:38,355
Scream!

509
00:23:39,109 --> 00:23:41,655
(It's dancing time.)

510
00:23:47,449 --> 00:23:48,694
Scream!

511
00:23:48,889 --> 00:23:51,958
(He shows some elegant grooves.)

512
00:23:51,959 --> 00:23:54,158
(I'm a femme fatale.)

513
00:23:54,159 --> 00:23:57,034
(Jae Seok approaches the audience.)

514
00:23:57,490 --> 00:23:59,128
(The singers in the green room can also feel the vibe.)

515
00:23:59,129 --> 00:24:00,398
That looks nice.

516
00:24:00,399 --> 00:24:02,474
- They're good at dancing. - I know.

517
00:24:03,500 --> 00:24:07,575
(The fans are having their own dancing time too.)

518
00:24:38,500 --> 00:24:43,108
(Before this song is over)

519
00:24:43,109 --> 00:24:44,708
(Hush)

520
00:24:44,709 --> 00:24:46,855
(She's excited.)

521
00:24:55,850 --> 00:24:56,948
(The melody builds up,)

522
00:24:56,949 --> 00:25:02,158
(and the vibe is similar to that during the Running Man festival.)

523
00:25:02,159 --> 00:25:05,029
(Confess today)

524
00:25:05,030 --> 00:25:08,004
(Or just kiss me)

525
00:25:09,500 --> 00:25:13,069
(She sings some high notes.)

526
00:25:13,070 --> 00:25:17,044
(Confetti, the highlight of festivals, shoots out.)

527
00:25:17,709 --> 00:25:19,014
That's just my style.

528
00:25:19,080 --> 00:25:20,385
That is.

529
00:25:23,109 --> 00:25:26,979
(So Min gives a signal by singing a high note,)

530
00:25:26,980 --> 00:25:30,595
(and the confetti falls down.)

531
00:25:31,490 --> 00:25:33,194
Scream!

532
00:25:34,889 --> 00:25:36,559
Scream!

533
00:25:36,560 --> 00:25:38,858
(It exceeds 120dB.)

534
00:25:38,859 --> 00:25:43,175
(The confetti helps liven up the atmosphere even more.)

535
00:25:56,580 --> 00:25:57,779
(To be honest,)

536
00:25:57,780 --> 00:26:00,425
(I don't like it)

537
00:26:00,619 --> 00:26:02,618
(The lyrics are 100-percent relatable,)

538
00:26:02,619 --> 00:26:06,065
(and the band's performance complements it.)

539
00:26:06,359 --> 00:26:08,759
(No one can resist confessing their feelings...)

540
00:26:08,760 --> 00:26:11,234
(after hearing this song.)

541
00:26:18,199 --> 00:26:21,739
(Before this song is over)

542
00:26:21,740 --> 00:26:24,938
(Young Bae sings the high note clearly.)

543
00:26:24,939 --> 00:26:27,214
(Confess already)

544
00:26:27,540 --> 00:26:30,309
(They finally approach the part where they'll liven up...)

545
00:26:30,310 --> 00:26:32,349
(the atmosphere even more.)

546
00:26:32,350 --> 00:26:33,549
Jump!

547
00:26:33,550 --> 00:26:36,089
(He urges them to jump.)

548
00:26:36,090 --> 00:26:38,534
- Scream! - Jump!

549
00:26:40,320 --> 00:26:43,365
(They reached 133dB which is the highest yet.)

550
00:26:43,929 --> 00:26:45,299
They're all having a good time.

551
00:26:45,300 --> 00:26:46,329
(It's as if they're the main event.)

552
00:26:46,330 --> 00:26:47,774
They're all enjoying their performance.

553
00:26:48,230 --> 00:26:49,744
Isn't it a great song?

554
00:26:50,330 --> 00:26:54,214
(The fun energy doesn't seem to end.)

555
00:26:56,209 --> 00:26:59,009
(SORAN ends the song...)

556
00:26:59,010 --> 00:27:02,948
(with the most band-like noisy instrumental ending.)

557
00:27:02,949 --> 00:27:07,878
(The icing on the cake!)

558
00:27:07,879 --> 00:27:10,224
(Screaming)

559
00:27:10,419 --> 00:27:13,065
(The song was based on So Min's real love story.)

560
00:27:13,820 --> 00:27:14,888
Thank you.

561
00:27:14,889 --> 00:27:17,264
(And the performance was like that of a romantic comedy musical.)

562
00:27:23,399 --> 00:27:25,145
That was amazing.

563
00:27:27,500 --> 00:27:28,809
How was it? Was that fun?

564
00:27:28,810 --> 00:27:30,408
- Yes. - Yes!

565
00:27:30,409 --> 00:27:32,309
Thank you. As we said earlier,

566
00:27:32,310 --> 00:27:35,979
this song is called "Confess Already".

567
00:27:35,980 --> 00:27:37,125
I'm so embarrassed.

568
00:27:37,379 --> 00:27:38,555
Are you all right?

569
00:27:38,850 --> 00:27:41,648
Well, the song is based on...

570
00:27:41,649 --> 00:27:43,789
So Min's real-life experience of love.

571
00:27:43,790 --> 00:27:47,388
It openly expresses the real aspects of love.

572
00:27:47,389 --> 00:27:49,589
- Many women can relate to it. - Jae Seok...

573
00:27:49,590 --> 00:27:51,204
(So Min must be lonely.)

574
00:27:51,230 --> 00:27:53,599
- Many women can relate to it. - Jae Seok...

575
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:55,698
There's something I'm curious about.

576
00:27:55,699 --> 00:27:57,529
You separated yourself from us...

577
00:27:57,530 --> 00:27:59,668
and even named us Jeon SORAN and Yu Jae Seok.

578
00:27:59,669 --> 00:28:01,868
- So what's with the flashy outfit? - Tell me about it.

579
00:28:01,869 --> 00:28:04,039
(What's with the flashy outfit?)

580
00:28:04,040 --> 00:28:05,708
- This was on purpose. - How could you?

581
00:28:05,709 --> 00:28:07,214
He wanted to stand out.

582
00:28:07,510 --> 00:28:09,208
What on earth are those flowers too?

583
00:28:09,209 --> 00:28:11,009
It's called stoloniferous trigonotis.

584
00:28:11,010 --> 00:28:12,079
Stoloniferous trigonotis?

585
00:28:12,080 --> 00:28:14,049
- They're all over you. - I haven't heard of it,

586
00:28:14,050 --> 00:28:15,148
- but that's what it is. - The mic...

587
00:28:15,149 --> 00:28:16,825
There are too much.

588
00:28:16,949 --> 00:28:18,865
To be honest, I didn't want to be intimidated.

589
00:28:19,689 --> 00:28:21,135
You wanted to stand out.

590
00:28:21,429 --> 00:28:22,529
I needed to stand out as well.

591
00:28:22,530 --> 00:28:23,888
Go, Jae Seok!

592
00:28:23,889 --> 00:28:25,499
(Make some noise!)

593
00:28:25,500 --> 00:28:26,799
(Stand tall, Jae Seok!)

594
00:28:26,800 --> 00:28:31,004
It's now time for the final collaborative performance.

595
00:28:31,300 --> 00:28:32,339
(No one can sing quite like Gummy.)

596
00:28:32,340 --> 00:28:33,698
The focus of this team...

597
00:28:33,699 --> 00:28:35,339
- has to be Haha. - That's right.

598
00:28:35,340 --> 00:28:37,714
He's performing with two exceptional singers.

599
00:28:38,010 --> 00:28:40,355
(Gummy and the Mosquito are great vocalists.)

600
00:28:40,810 --> 00:28:43,678
I don't know how Haha will hold his own.

601
00:28:43,679 --> 00:28:45,849
Then let's hear from them right away.

602
00:28:45,850 --> 00:28:48,418
We were Jeon SORAN and Yu Jae Seok. Thank you.

603
00:28:48,419 --> 00:28:49,849
- Thank you. - Thank you.

604
00:28:49,850 --> 00:28:50,888
(We were Jeon SORAN and Yu Jae Seok.)

605
00:28:50,889 --> 00:28:54,395
(Jeon SORAN and Yu Jae Seok are the best!)

606
00:28:56,060 --> 00:29:00,029
(Jeon SORAN and Yu Jae Seok step down after a successful show.)

607
00:29:00,030 --> 00:29:02,128
Young Bae, the song is amazing.

608
00:29:02,129 --> 00:29:04,004
- Thank you so much. - I love the song.

609
00:29:04,169 --> 00:29:06,198
- The song is amazing. - Jeon SORAN and Yu Jae Seok.

610
00:29:06,199 --> 00:29:08,138
Yes? Oh, our clue.

611
00:29:08,139 --> 00:29:09,168
There's no doubt we received over 120dB.

612
00:29:09,169 --> 00:29:11,309
- We must hear this. - The decibel you reached was...

613
00:29:11,310 --> 00:29:12,309
(The crowd was the wildest.)

614
00:29:12,310 --> 00:29:15,049
- You received 133dB. - Gosh, that's high.

615
00:29:15,050 --> 00:29:18,678
(They reached the highest at 133dB which warrants them a clue.)

616
00:29:18,679 --> 00:29:20,319
- That's really high. - Right.

617
00:29:20,320 --> 00:29:21,849
Please choose 1 of the 3.

618
00:29:21,850 --> 00:29:22,849
- So Min, go ahead. - No, you choose.

619
00:29:22,850 --> 00:29:23,994
- Me? - Yes.

620
00:29:24,290 --> 00:29:27,218
(Which clue did Jae Seok choose?)

621
00:29:27,219 --> 00:29:29,529
"The spy has been on Running Man for nine years."

622
00:29:29,530 --> 00:29:30,865
(The spy has been on Running Man for 9 years.)

623
00:29:31,159 --> 00:29:32,259
- Then... - It's not me...

624
00:29:32,260 --> 00:29:33,428
- or Se Chan. - It's one of the original cast.

625
00:29:33,429 --> 00:29:35,168
This excludes So Min and Se Chan.

626
00:29:35,169 --> 00:29:37,069
- They're excluded. - It's not me or Se Chan.

627
00:29:37,070 --> 00:29:38,168
(So Min and Se Chan joined in 2017.)

628
00:29:38,169 --> 00:29:39,599
Good luck and good job.

629
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:40,599
- You did great too. - Thank you.

630
00:29:40,600 --> 00:29:42,239
- Thank you. - Thanks.

631
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:43,438
Nice.

632
00:29:43,439 --> 00:29:45,385
The spy has been with the show for nine years.

633
00:29:48,409 --> 00:29:51,279
(The audience hasn't calmed down from the previous song yet.)

634
00:29:51,280 --> 00:29:53,224
(Ballad Queen Gummy appears.)

635
00:29:53,580 --> 00:29:56,024
(My gosh, it's Gummy!)

636
00:29:57,090 --> 00:29:59,089
(The boss enters to begin the last collaborative performance.)

637
00:29:59,090 --> 00:30:02,805
Hello, I'm Gummy. It's nice to meet you all.

638
00:30:03,330 --> 00:30:05,774
(She wins them all over by just appearing.)

639
00:30:06,699 --> 00:30:09,799
I don't know what to do with your enthusiasm today.

640
00:30:09,800 --> 00:30:12,269
I'm sure you know who I'll be performing with.

641
00:30:12,270 --> 00:30:13,769
- Yes. - Yes.

642
00:30:13,770 --> 00:30:15,769
What do you think? Are we compatible?

643
00:30:15,770 --> 00:30:17,009
- Yes. - Yes.

644
00:30:17,010 --> 00:30:18,708
- Really? - Yes.

645
00:30:18,709 --> 00:30:22,579
Once you listen to our song, you'll know...

646
00:30:22,580 --> 00:30:25,148
why we were chosen to perform last.

647
00:30:25,149 --> 00:30:27,925
Let's get to it. Thank you.

648
00:30:28,490 --> 00:30:30,395
(They can't wait.)

649
00:30:31,119 --> 00:30:33,234
(Gummy steps on the center stand.)

650
00:30:33,689 --> 00:30:36,888
(The two men who will accompany her)

651
00:30:36,889 --> 00:30:40,059
(Haha)

652
00:30:40,060 --> 00:30:43,375
(Jong Kook)

653
00:30:44,469 --> 00:30:46,599
(What kind of performance will they bring?)

654
00:30:46,600 --> 00:30:48,309
- Amazing! - Go, go!

655
00:30:48,310 --> 00:30:49,908
(Gummy)

656
00:30:49,909 --> 00:30:51,408
(Kim Jong Kook)

657
00:30:51,409 --> 00:30:53,039
(Haha)

658
00:30:53,040 --> 00:30:57,155
(F-Killer, 9 Years of Running Man)

659
00:30:57,750 --> 00:31:00,878
(The day of F-Killer's recording)

660
00:31:00,879 --> 00:31:02,888
- That was good. - I have a question.

661
00:31:02,889 --> 00:31:03,888
Gosh.

662
00:31:03,889 --> 00:31:05,888
If you're only going to sigh, let me rap instead.

663
00:31:05,889 --> 00:31:06,958
That's not it.

664
00:31:06,959 --> 00:31:08,059
(Out of the blue)

665
00:31:08,060 --> 00:31:09,958
(You misunderstood me.)

666
00:31:09,959 --> 00:31:11,065
Right?

667
00:31:11,389 --> 00:31:13,428
- I never sighed. - It's infuriating, you know.

668
00:31:13,429 --> 00:31:14,428
Haha, please.

669
00:31:14,429 --> 00:31:15,529
(Why is Haha upset?)

670
00:31:15,530 --> 00:31:19,774
(When Cho Jung Seok was on set a few weeks back...)

671
00:31:20,939 --> 00:31:23,514
(While driving,)

672
00:31:24,369 --> 00:31:27,809
(I said that it'd be amazing to have her and Jong Kook sing...)

673
00:31:27,810 --> 00:31:29,408
(while Haha raps.)

674
00:31:29,409 --> 00:31:32,378
(But Gummy...)

675
00:31:32,379 --> 00:31:37,964
(She shook her head saying that Haha wants to sing.)

676
00:31:38,859 --> 00:31:41,418
(We finally know how Gummy really feels.)

677
00:31:41,419 --> 00:31:42,665
(He doesn't know his place.)

678
00:31:43,260 --> 00:31:46,105
(Haha's hurt.)

679
00:31:46,399 --> 00:31:48,198
(I'm sorry to tell you this,)

680
00:31:48,199 --> 00:31:49,875
(but the conversation ended at that moment.)

681
00:31:50,629 --> 00:31:53,039
(He's been torn to pieces.)

682
00:31:53,040 --> 00:31:54,668
(Haha was wounded since that day.)

683
00:31:54,669 --> 00:31:57,339
I just said that you were singing too,

684
00:31:57,340 --> 00:31:58,779
and he said, "Really?"

685
00:31:58,780 --> 00:32:00,579
- Then what? - The conversation ended there.

686
00:32:00,580 --> 00:32:01,779
Why though?

687
00:32:01,780 --> 00:32:03,279
- I don't know. - So what now?

688
00:32:03,280 --> 00:32:05,418
- It's fine. - I can still rap if you want.

689
00:32:05,419 --> 00:32:06,418
It's all right.

690
00:32:06,419 --> 00:32:08,365
(I can rap instead.)

691
00:32:09,090 --> 00:32:12,135
(Old-school rapping)

692
00:32:12,590 --> 00:32:15,489
(What on earth was that?)

693
00:32:15,490 --> 00:32:16,704
What on earth was that?

694
00:32:17,129 --> 00:32:19,398
Jung Seok did say something else.

695
00:32:19,399 --> 00:32:21,499
- As in what? - "He's not a bad singer, right?"

696
00:32:21,500 --> 00:32:23,499
- Stop it. - I'm not kidding.

697
00:32:23,500 --> 00:32:25,039
- Gosh. - He really said so.

698
00:32:25,040 --> 00:32:27,398
I might have a unique vibe, but I'm not that good of a vocalist.

699
00:32:27,399 --> 00:32:29,145
No, you're good.

700
00:32:30,909 --> 00:32:32,484
My nickname is Blowfly.

701
00:32:33,510 --> 00:32:35,779
I was called that because of my name.

702
00:32:35,780 --> 00:32:38,355
So how about Spider, Blowfly, and Mosquito?

703
00:32:38,649 --> 00:32:40,249
We might shoot a commercial for a bug killer product.

704
00:32:40,250 --> 00:32:41,595
Yes, the three of us.

705
00:32:41,889 --> 00:32:43,325
What should we name our team?

706
00:32:44,189 --> 00:32:45,964
How about F-Killer?

707
00:32:47,020 --> 00:32:48,158
(It goes well with them since they're insects.)

708
00:32:48,159 --> 00:32:50,264
Can we not use it because it's the name of a brand?

709
00:32:50,590 --> 00:32:52,034
We'll go with F-Killer.

710
00:32:52,399 --> 00:32:54,299
- F-Killer? I like it. - Nice.

711
00:32:54,300 --> 00:32:56,698
The F can stand for fans.

712
00:32:56,699 --> 00:32:58,499
(The interpretation is even better.)

713
00:32:58,500 --> 00:33:00,198
- We'll kill the fans. - Nice.

714
00:33:00,199 --> 00:33:01,398
Set them on fire.

715
00:33:01,399 --> 00:33:03,309
(F-Killer means that they'll entertain the fans.)

716
00:33:03,310 --> 00:33:04,544
I love it.

717
00:33:04,770 --> 00:33:06,784
(F stands for fans!)

718
00:33:07,139 --> 00:33:10,585
(They're ready to die.)

719
00:33:11,050 --> 00:33:12,249
I love it.

720
00:33:12,250 --> 00:33:15,625
I know it's a cliche, but I want you two to battle it out.

721
00:33:15,790 --> 00:33:17,289
- Just go crazy. - You keep saying that.

722
00:33:17,290 --> 00:33:18,519
It's definitely needed.

723
00:33:18,520 --> 00:33:19,958
(After naming the team, Gummy starts recording.)

724
00:33:19,959 --> 00:33:21,519
- Okay. - Why are you applauding?

725
00:33:21,520 --> 00:33:22,665
Finally.

726
00:33:23,490 --> 00:33:24,964
What is this for?

727
00:33:25,300 --> 00:33:27,499
Gosh, please don't. Now I feel pressured.

728
00:33:27,500 --> 00:33:31,128
I can't wait to hear you sing your section.

729
00:33:31,129 --> 00:33:33,138
There's no way you can't sound cool singing this.

730
00:33:33,139 --> 00:33:35,184
- Come on. - You know that, right?

731
00:33:35,439 --> 00:33:37,708
(Even her warm-up is cool.)

732
00:33:37,709 --> 00:33:38,809
(She's ready.)

733
00:33:38,810 --> 00:33:40,279
Yes, thank you.

734
00:33:40,280 --> 00:33:43,208
Gummy, let's do a practice round.

735
00:33:43,209 --> 00:33:44,284
Sure.

736
00:33:44,379 --> 00:33:49,019
(It's the only ballad among the collaborative performances.)

737
00:33:49,020 --> 00:33:53,494
(She gets into the mood like a true professional.)

738
00:33:55,330 --> 00:33:57,764
(It already sounds like a huge hit.)

739
00:33:58,699 --> 00:34:01,259
(In awe)

740
00:34:01,260 --> 00:34:03,175
(Hearts race.)

741
00:34:04,530 --> 00:34:07,168
If I had a voice like that, I'd excitedly sing all day.

742
00:34:07,169 --> 00:34:08,968
Me too.

743
00:34:08,969 --> 00:34:14,809
I remember your sparkling gaze

744
00:34:14,810 --> 00:34:16,355
I'll try that again.

745
00:34:17,480 --> 00:34:18,948
(She's the best.)

746
00:34:18,949 --> 00:34:20,754
This is amazing.

747
00:34:21,379 --> 00:34:23,388
I listen to your voice

748
00:34:23,389 --> 00:34:26,358
The first part is good in that powerful voice,

749
00:34:26,359 --> 00:34:28,759
but the second part sounds better with the added emotion.

750
00:34:28,760 --> 00:34:31,188
You should hit the first part quite strongly though.

751
00:34:31,189 --> 00:34:32,599
That's what I think too.

752
00:34:32,600 --> 00:34:34,799
- What... - Let me finish!

753
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:36,529
(Intercept)

754
00:34:36,530 --> 00:34:38,539
- Let me finish! - Hold on.

755
00:34:38,540 --> 00:34:40,698
When singing the next part though,

756
00:34:40,699 --> 00:34:42,868
say "sparkle" twice, all right?

757
00:34:42,869 --> 00:34:45,254
(He pushes it too far.)

758
00:34:46,080 --> 00:34:47,539
"I remember your sparkling, sparkling gaze"

759
00:34:47,540 --> 00:34:48,724
Let's hear it.

760
00:34:50,379 --> 00:34:51,648
All right. I'll try again.

761
00:34:51,649 --> 00:34:54,595
What if you extended the note like so?

762
00:34:55,020 --> 00:34:58,764
It sounds a bit bland, so add on to it.

763
00:34:58,859 --> 00:35:00,759
(Like this?)

764
00:35:00,760 --> 00:35:01,835
Like this?

765
00:35:02,389 --> 00:35:03,504
I'm listening to all his requests.

766
00:35:03,590 --> 00:35:05,375
That's enough feedback from me then.

767
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:07,958
I'll stop.

768
00:35:07,959 --> 00:35:11,204
I feel bad about ruining the mood.

769
00:35:11,429 --> 00:35:17,968
(Just like Haha ordered)

770
00:35:17,969 --> 00:35:21,385
(Another one of Haha's orders)

771
00:35:23,179 --> 00:35:25,948
Can we record this version just for fun?

772
00:35:25,949 --> 00:35:28,425
Just once so that I can personally keep it.

773
00:35:28,649 --> 00:35:29,688
Really?

774
00:35:29,689 --> 00:35:31,019
- Should I sing it that way? - I'm serious.

775
00:35:31,020 --> 00:35:32,158
All right.

776
00:35:32,159 --> 00:35:33,264
(The generous Gummy does it for him.)

777
00:35:46,340 --> 00:35:50,168
(Seriously)

778
00:35:50,169 --> 00:35:53,085
(Remember)

779
00:35:54,909 --> 00:35:57,754
(Gummy did it for me!)

780
00:35:59,219 --> 00:36:00,878
What did Mr. Producer think?

781
00:36:00,879 --> 00:36:04,218
Okay, that was great. Let's listen to it and then move on.

782
00:36:04,219 --> 00:36:05,394
(She hopes this healed his wound.)

783
00:36:06,520 --> 00:36:09,028
(Next up is Haha who is a singer despite how he seems.)

784
00:36:09,029 --> 00:36:11,035
(He's dead serious.)

785
00:36:15,529 --> 00:36:19,575
(He gets in the mood and calmly sings the song.)

786
00:36:20,500 --> 00:36:23,745
(Blowfly isn't that bad.)

787
00:36:24,409 --> 00:36:26,809
- Haha, that was great. - Right.

788
00:36:26,810 --> 00:36:29,649
Since we have an identity now,

789
00:36:29,650 --> 00:36:31,379
you should call him Blowfly.

790
00:36:31,380 --> 00:36:32,579
(You should call him Blowfly.)

791
00:36:32,580 --> 00:36:34,278
(Oh...)

792
00:36:34,279 --> 00:36:36,725
- Mr. Blowfly... - Yes?

793
00:36:37,319 --> 00:36:39,834
(Mr. Blowfly)

794
00:36:40,759 --> 00:36:43,528
Was that Mosquito speaking?

795
00:36:43,529 --> 00:36:44,629
Yes.

796
00:36:44,630 --> 00:36:47,205
Listen to your voice

797
00:36:47,230 --> 00:36:48,745
- "Vo". - Try that part again.

798
00:36:49,170 --> 00:36:51,644
- "Voice", that part. - Voice

799
00:36:52,170 --> 00:36:54,068
(Like this?)

800
00:36:54,069 --> 00:36:55,439
- Like this. - Voice

801
00:36:55,440 --> 00:36:57,685
Bring your bottom lip to your top teeth.

802
00:36:57,770 --> 00:36:58,879
"Voice".

803
00:36:58,880 --> 00:37:01,138
- Voice - I listen to your voice

804
00:37:01,139 --> 00:37:02,879
- There you go. - Okay.

805
00:37:02,880 --> 00:37:05,579
(After some practice,)

806
00:37:05,580 --> 00:37:06,649
(Haha manages the "V" sound.)

807
00:37:06,650 --> 00:37:07,825
That sounds great.

808
00:37:09,690 --> 00:37:11,088
(You're doing great.)

809
00:37:11,089 --> 00:37:12,194
That sounds really nice.

810
00:37:12,259 --> 00:37:14,088
He pulled off "voice".

811
00:37:14,089 --> 00:37:15,334
(Embarrassed)

812
00:37:15,790 --> 00:37:19,258
(Following Haha, Mosquito records his part.)

813
00:37:19,259 --> 00:37:21,234
- He's incredible. - I can't believe him.

814
00:37:22,100 --> 00:37:26,099
(It's finally rehearsal day.)

815
00:37:26,100 --> 00:37:27,338
You can do this!

816
00:37:27,339 --> 00:37:28,575
(Let's do this!)

817
00:37:29,009 --> 00:37:30,809
Mosquito, Gummy, and Ant, you can do this!

818
00:37:30,810 --> 00:37:32,385
(They're a team of insects.)

819
00:37:33,110 --> 00:37:34,754
- Am I Ant? - Yes, you are.

820
00:37:34,909 --> 00:37:36,124
Let's start.

821
00:37:36,480 --> 00:37:37,854
Be confident, Haha!

822
00:37:39,619 --> 00:37:41,694
Don't compete with Jong Kook and Gummy!

823
00:37:42,449 --> 00:37:45,964
(With the other members cheering, they start rehearsing.)

824
00:37:46,790 --> 00:37:51,588
(Jong Kook's soft singing...)

825
00:37:51,589 --> 00:37:54,635
(is followed by Gummy.)

826
00:37:55,699 --> 00:37:57,798
(Haha steals all the attention.)

827
00:37:57,799 --> 00:38:00,068
(Haha focuses more on dancing.)

828
00:38:00,069 --> 00:38:01,874
(The mood is ruined.)

829
00:38:03,540 --> 00:38:05,579
(Laughing)

830
00:38:05,580 --> 00:38:07,754
(What is he doing?)

831
00:38:09,049 --> 00:38:12,694
(I'm here too.)

832
00:38:13,719 --> 00:38:15,624
(Ant does have a lot of presence.)

833
00:38:16,489 --> 00:38:19,088
(They're 2 singers and 1 dancer.)

834
00:38:19,089 --> 00:38:20,258
Good job!

835
00:38:20,259 --> 00:38:21,734
(They're 2 singers and 1 dancer.)

836
00:38:22,089 --> 00:38:23,229
Be confident!

837
00:38:23,230 --> 00:38:24,504
Good job!

838
00:38:24,529 --> 00:38:26,075
Good job, Mosquito, Gummy, and Ant!

839
00:38:26,159 --> 00:38:27,559
Ant, we're on your side!

840
00:38:27,560 --> 00:38:31,568
(This is Haha's first time singing a ballad.)

841
00:38:31,569 --> 00:38:32,868
(He will sing with...)

842
00:38:32,869 --> 00:38:34,274
(amazing singers Jong Kook and Gummy.)

843
00:38:35,100 --> 00:38:37,269
(We can't wait.)

844
00:38:37,270 --> 00:38:38,444
I've been looking forward to this.

845
00:38:38,839 --> 00:38:42,448
(What will F-Killer's performance be like?)

846
00:38:42,449 --> 00:38:49,024
("Raise Your Voice" by F-Killer Gummy, Jong Kook, Haha)

847
00:38:56,290 --> 00:39:00,405
(Haha starts the song calmly.)

848
00:39:03,100 --> 00:39:04,774
I shouldn't laugh.

849
00:39:05,270 --> 00:39:06,999
I can't stop thinking of "The Gang".

850
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:08,198
(This reminds you of his 1st album, "The Gang".)

851
00:39:08,199 --> 00:39:09,385
The Gang.

852
00:39:09,909 --> 00:39:12,138
(Serious)

853
00:39:12,139 --> 00:39:13,854
(This is cool.)

854
00:39:14,310 --> 00:39:18,979
(The audience is surprised at Haha's new side.)

855
00:39:18,980 --> 00:39:22,749
(Even when I'm tired)

856
00:39:22,750 --> 00:39:27,388
(I have you in my life)

857
00:39:27,389 --> 00:39:31,004
(Who held my hand)

858
00:39:32,500 --> 00:39:37,269
(Don't you know)

859
00:39:37,270 --> 00:39:42,539
(How precious you are to me)

860
00:39:42,540 --> 00:39:48,155
(Mosquito adds emotion to the song with his beautiful voice.)

861
00:39:55,389 --> 00:39:59,135
(The female audience falls in love with his voice.)

862
00:40:06,560 --> 00:40:09,644
(Here comes the ultimate singer.)

863
00:40:10,900 --> 00:40:14,475
I listen to your voice

864
00:40:15,670 --> 00:40:18,144
(Shocked)

865
00:40:19,409 --> 00:40:23,609
(Gummy's powerful voice leave the audience speechless.)

866
00:40:23,610 --> 00:40:27,124
(It's a real treat to the ear.)

867
00:40:28,549 --> 00:40:31,095
It's almost like the light only falls on Gummy.

868
00:40:32,489 --> 00:40:34,234
I wish I could sing like her even once.

869
00:40:35,360 --> 00:40:39,805
(Don't you know)

870
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:45,769
(How precious you are to me)

871
00:40:45,770 --> 00:40:49,709
(You are the world to me)

872
00:40:49,710 --> 00:40:53,655
(That never withers)

873
00:40:57,580 --> 00:41:02,519
(Gummy's main melody and Haha's bass...)

874
00:41:02,520 --> 00:41:05,464
(are beautifully harmonized.)

875
00:41:05,819 --> 00:41:09,164
(I love this song.)

876
00:41:10,730 --> 00:41:13,658
(When you think it's dark and there's a long way left)

877
00:41:13,659 --> 00:41:18,305
(Raise your head Can you see it?)

878
00:41:18,429 --> 00:41:22,245
(The night sky full of stars)

879
00:41:23,040 --> 00:41:26,714
(The three of them sing in beautiful harmony.)

880
00:41:27,310 --> 00:41:31,124
(Fantastic vocals)

881
00:41:32,580 --> 00:41:35,294
(Everyone is in love.)

882
00:41:36,489 --> 00:41:40,334
(This is F-Killer.)

883
00:41:44,690 --> 00:41:49,705
(Haha sings the low notes.)

884
00:41:57,940 --> 00:42:00,254
(Perfect harmony)

885
00:42:01,080 --> 00:42:05,185
(The audience cheering reaches way over 120dB.)

886
00:42:05,779 --> 00:42:08,988
(If we hold each other's hand)

887
00:42:08,989 --> 00:42:13,459
(Raise your head, can you see it?)

888
00:42:13,460 --> 00:42:17,435
(Countless stars singing together)

889
00:42:17,860 --> 00:42:20,258
(Explosive high notes)

890
00:42:20,259 --> 00:42:24,169
(The fan killers sing the high notes passionately.)

891
00:42:24,170 --> 00:42:28,515
(The three singers sing in harmony.)

892
00:42:29,110 --> 00:42:32,579
(Jong Kook's soft voice)

893
00:42:32,580 --> 00:42:35,079
(Gummy's powerful voice)

894
00:42:35,080 --> 00:42:37,609
(Haha's attractive low voice)

895
00:42:37,610 --> 00:42:42,095
(F-Killer is a fantastic combination.)

896
00:42:43,096 --> 00:42:48,096

<font color="#ff5fa2">-♥ Ruo Xi ♥-</font>

897
00:42:49,290 --> 00:42:52,234
(That performance was incredible.)

898
00:42:53,400 --> 00:42:57,068
(Their passion even reaches the green room.)

899
00:42:57,069 --> 00:43:00,245
- That was crazy. - This is the real hit song.

900
00:43:02,100 --> 00:43:04,039
(The stage is still full of emotions.)

901
00:43:04,040 --> 00:43:05,644
- F-Killer. - Thank You.

902
00:43:06,110 --> 00:43:09,155
(Your performance was the best, F-Killer.)

903
00:43:09,449 --> 00:43:11,084
Come here, Haha.

904
00:43:12,049 --> 00:43:14,524
- He really set the mood. - Why are you so shy?

905
00:43:14,980 --> 00:43:17,689
I tried so hard not to look the audience in the eye.

906
00:43:17,690 --> 00:43:19,118
What did you think of Haha's singing?

907
00:43:19,119 --> 00:43:20,765
- What did you think? - Thank you.

908
00:43:21,219 --> 00:43:22,289
- See? - It was an honor.

909
00:43:22,290 --> 00:43:24,428
It was an honor to sing with these two.

910
00:43:24,429 --> 00:43:26,258
Not a single person laughed.

911
00:43:26,259 --> 00:43:27,999
- He was worried. - I saw a few people laugh.

912
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:29,774
(I saw a few.)

913
00:43:31,170 --> 00:43:33,169
- Where? - A few over there.

914
00:43:33,170 --> 00:43:34,944
I heard someone laugh over there too.

915
00:43:35,299 --> 00:43:37,769
- It's okay. - They cheered for us so much.

916
00:43:37,770 --> 00:43:39,939
- Even from the beginning. - I almost cried.

917
00:43:39,940 --> 00:43:41,338
- It helped a lot. - Thank you.

918
00:43:41,339 --> 00:43:42,408
I was touched.

919
00:43:42,409 --> 00:43:44,109
- Thank you. - Thank you.

920
00:43:44,110 --> 00:43:45,209
(You were all amazing.)

921
00:43:45,210 --> 00:43:46,479
- Thank you. - Actually,

922
00:43:46,480 --> 00:43:48,778
- Gummy is injured. - I'm fine.

923
00:43:48,779 --> 00:43:50,488
- I'm really fine. - She was in a lot of pain.

924
00:43:50,489 --> 00:43:52,218
- I'm fine. - Please give her a big hand.

925
00:43:52,219 --> 00:43:53,758
- Thank you. - It must have been hard.

926
00:43:53,759 --> 00:43:55,218
(Despite her injury, she did her best like a pro.)

927
00:43:55,219 --> 00:43:56,588
She was wearing a cast,

928
00:43:56,589 --> 00:43:58,258
but she put on tape...

929
00:43:58,259 --> 00:43:59,798
- and shoes for the performance. - Seriously...

930
00:43:59,799 --> 00:44:02,368
If it weren't for my injury, I would have danced for you.

931
00:44:02,369 --> 00:44:03,868
- I'm sorry. - That's a shame.

932
00:44:03,869 --> 00:44:05,499
I'm so touched. Thank you!

933
00:44:05,500 --> 00:44:06,675
Thank you!

934
00:44:07,339 --> 00:44:08,468
Thank you.

935
00:44:08,469 --> 00:44:12,068
Now all our collaborative performances are over.

936
00:44:12,069 --> 00:44:13,885
- That's right. - We're...

937
00:44:14,239 --> 00:44:17,185
feeling more and more pressured.

938
00:44:17,779 --> 00:44:20,379
We'll do a group dance...

939
00:44:20,380 --> 00:44:22,849
(The next performance is the much-anticipated group dance.)

940
00:44:22,850 --> 00:44:25,425
And we'll sing Running Man's theme song.

941
00:44:26,119 --> 00:44:27,664
Those are our two last performances.

942
00:44:27,960 --> 00:44:29,888
- Should we go and get ready? - Sure.

943
00:44:29,889 --> 00:44:31,289
- We'll go in now. - We'll go in.

944
00:44:31,290 --> 00:44:32,658
- We'll go in. - Thank you. See you in a bit!

945
00:44:32,659 --> 00:44:34,359
- Thank you! - See you. Thank you!

946
00:44:34,360 --> 00:44:37,475
(You can see the performances shortly.)

947
00:44:39,170 --> 00:44:40,468
(Surprised)

948
00:44:40,469 --> 00:44:41,644
Are we getting a hint?

949
00:44:41,940 --> 00:44:43,008
Are we?

950
00:44:43,009 --> 00:44:44,368
- Give us a hint. - Are you giving us a hint?

951
00:44:44,369 --> 00:44:47,809
The audience cheering for you reached 124dB,

952
00:44:47,810 --> 00:44:49,249
so you're entitled to a hint.

953
00:44:49,250 --> 00:44:51,309
Oh, my. I'm relieved.

954
00:44:51,310 --> 00:44:53,394
- Choose 1 hint out of these 3. - This one?

955
00:44:53,449 --> 00:44:54,854
- You choose. - Can't we get one for each person?

956
00:44:57,049 --> 00:44:58,189
What is this?

957
00:44:58,190 --> 00:44:59,564
"The spy was lucky today."

958
00:45:00,060 --> 00:45:01,088
The spy was lucky today?

959
00:45:01,089 --> 00:45:02,289
Who was lucky today?

960
00:45:02,290 --> 00:45:05,435
(What do these hints mean?)

961
00:45:05,560 --> 00:45:07,599
- All right. - All right.

962
00:45:07,600 --> 00:45:10,245
(The hints are confusing. Who is the spy?)

963
00:45:11,569 --> 00:45:13,144
Who do you think is the spy?

964
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:16,314
The spy buys coffee once in a while.

965
00:45:17,069 --> 00:45:18,684
"Once in a while"?

966
00:45:18,939 --> 00:45:20,555
Doesn't Bo Pil buy coffee once in a while?

967
00:45:21,180 --> 00:45:22,409
What are you talking about?

968
00:45:22,410 --> 00:45:23,479
He's our assistant director.

969
00:45:23,480 --> 00:45:25,184
He might be the spy.

970
00:45:25,480 --> 00:45:27,724
It doesn't have to be among the members.

971
00:45:27,879 --> 00:45:29,889
Jae Seok doesn't drink coffee at all.

972
00:45:29,890 --> 00:45:31,119
He's excluded.

973
00:45:31,120 --> 00:45:34,218
It must be either Jong Kook, Ji Hyo, or Haha.

974
00:45:34,219 --> 00:45:37,959
(Seok Jin suspects Jong Kook, Ji Hyo, and Haha.)

975
00:45:37,960 --> 00:45:39,305
Why am I excluded?

976
00:45:40,129 --> 00:45:41,334
Because of the coffee hint.

977
00:45:41,359 --> 00:45:42,505
Why?

978
00:45:42,799 --> 00:45:44,199
You never buy coffee.

979
00:45:44,200 --> 00:45:45,468
I buy coffee often.

980
00:45:45,469 --> 00:45:46,539
- Really? - Yes.

981
00:45:46,540 --> 00:45:48,238
I don't know who it is,

982
00:45:48,239 --> 00:45:49,684
but it must have been hard for the spy today.

983
00:45:50,009 --> 00:45:52,039
Preparing for the performances and carrying out missions...

984
00:45:52,040 --> 00:45:54,209
I'm sure the spy has missions. It must have been hard.

985
00:45:54,210 --> 00:45:56,525
- I acknowledge the spy's hard work. - Me too.

986
00:45:56,549 --> 00:45:58,425
- It must have been stressful. - He's filming us again.

987
00:45:58,750 --> 00:46:00,378
(He's filming us again.)

988
00:46:00,379 --> 00:46:01,724
What's with you?

989
00:46:02,790 --> 00:46:04,548
(Am I suspicious?)

990
00:46:04,549 --> 00:46:05,724
Does this make sense?

991
00:46:05,960 --> 00:46:07,258
Does this even make sense?

992
00:46:07,259 --> 00:46:08,564
What is this?

993
00:46:08,620 --> 00:46:09,688
Why are you doing this?

994
00:46:09,689 --> 00:46:10,889
(You crave attention at 54.)

995
00:46:10,890 --> 00:46:12,059
Is this your mission?

996
00:46:12,060 --> 00:46:13,434
Are you the spy?

997
00:46:13,529 --> 00:46:14,834
He must be the spy.

998
00:46:15,160 --> 00:46:17,544
- It's Seok Jin. - But Seok Jin...

999
00:46:17,569 --> 00:46:19,238
He never buys coffee.

1000
00:46:19,239 --> 00:46:20,468
That's the confusing part.

1001
00:46:20,469 --> 00:46:22,809
- "Once in a while". - Let's just practice.

1002
00:46:22,810 --> 00:46:24,709
- Ready... - Hold on.

1003
00:46:24,710 --> 00:46:26,555
- Ready, start. - Ready, start.

1004
00:46:26,779 --> 00:46:29,949
(Seok Jin is still sitting in his chair.)

1005
00:46:29,950 --> 00:46:31,655
If you're not dancing with us, get out of our way.

1006
00:46:32,210 --> 00:46:34,354
(He only moves his upper body.)

1007
00:46:34,819 --> 00:46:36,318
Get out of our way.

1008
00:46:36,319 --> 00:46:37,695
Move over there.

1009
00:46:37,750 --> 00:46:38,818
I'm tired.

1010
00:46:38,819 --> 00:46:40,535
Where did you even get this chair?

1011
00:46:40,560 --> 00:46:42,019
It's a nice chair.

1012
00:46:42,020 --> 00:46:45,289
I am exhausted. You guys are practicing hard.

1013
00:46:45,290 --> 00:46:47,675
(Who could be the real spy?)

1014
00:46:49,299 --> 00:46:52,914
(Meanwhile, the surprise guest appears on stage.)

1015
00:46:53,469 --> 00:46:56,845
(The cheerful music livens up the atmosphere!)

1016
00:47:00,279 --> 00:47:01,385
It's Jin Young!

1017
00:47:02,910 --> 00:47:05,249
(It's Running Man's family,)

1018
00:47:05,250 --> 00:47:06,278
(Hong Jin Young!)

1019
00:47:06,279 --> 00:47:08,655
Hello, I am Hong Jin Young. It's nice to meet you.

1020
00:47:10,020 --> 00:47:11,624
(She suits everyone's tastes.)

1021
00:47:14,089 --> 00:47:16,365
("Love Battery" by Hong Jin Young)

1022
00:47:24,629 --> 00:47:26,005
(I am excited.)

1023
00:47:28,899 --> 00:47:32,514
(While Jin Young livens up the atmosphere on the stage,)

1024
00:47:33,879 --> 00:47:36,985
(the members do a final check backstage.)

1025
00:47:38,580 --> 00:47:39,724
I am so nervous.

1026
00:47:39,819 --> 00:47:41,079
Seriously.

1027
00:47:41,080 --> 00:47:43,164
- Are you okay? - I am okay.

1028
00:47:44,390 --> 00:47:45,688
Are you okay? Will you be able to do the lift?

1029
00:47:45,689 --> 00:47:47,159
- Will you? - Tonight...

1030
00:47:47,160 --> 00:47:49,729
- My goodness. - Seriously, that dance move...

1031
00:47:49,730 --> 00:47:50,934
with Jong Kook...

1032
00:47:51,489 --> 00:47:53,199
Jong Kook, can you lift me up?

1033
00:47:53,200 --> 00:47:55,675
(Jong Kook calms So Min down.)

1034
00:48:00,370 --> 00:48:04,084
(You are the best)

1035
00:48:06,279 --> 00:48:07,608
Thank you.

1036
00:48:07,609 --> 00:48:10,555
(The next performance is the group dance!)

1037
00:48:11,210 --> 00:48:13,449
- Should we remove the microphones? - Yes.

1038
00:48:13,450 --> 00:48:14,624
We need to remove the microphones.

1039
00:48:14,750 --> 00:48:16,965
We are removing the microphones.

1040
00:48:17,189 --> 00:48:19,965
- Remove the microphones. - My goodness.

1041
00:48:21,960 --> 00:48:24,329
(Both the members who are preparing for the performance...)

1042
00:48:24,330 --> 00:48:27,104
(and Lia who taught the dance are nervous.)

1043
00:48:27,600 --> 00:48:29,829
You will do a good job. You can do this.

1044
00:48:29,830 --> 00:48:31,704
(Will they be able to pull off the group dance?)

1045
00:48:31,899 --> 00:48:37,568
(Project Group Dance)

1046
00:48:37,569 --> 00:48:38,568
What is this?

1047
00:48:38,569 --> 00:48:40,985
(When the choreography of the group dance got revealed,)

1048
00:48:41,710 --> 00:48:44,454
(the level of difficulty shocked everyone.)

1049
00:48:46,350 --> 00:48:49,224
(The dancers in white T-shirts have the Running Man members' parts.)

1050
00:48:53,160 --> 00:48:54,465
That's the dance?

1051
00:48:57,560 --> 00:48:59,575
- Can they do that dance? - Seriously.

1052
00:49:02,299 --> 00:49:04,345
(Can the Running Man members do that dance?)

1053
00:49:08,969 --> 00:49:11,584
- I don't think we can do that. - Seriously.

1054
00:49:15,379 --> 00:49:16,985
Okay. Shall we begin?

1055
00:49:18,350 --> 00:49:21,918
Se Chan, take this path.

1056
00:49:21,919 --> 00:49:24,918
Take this path all the way...

1057
00:49:24,919 --> 00:49:26,088
to here.

1058
00:49:26,089 --> 00:49:28,218
- Come in front of So Min. - Okay.

1059
00:49:28,219 --> 00:49:31,588
Then boom! Jump and throw your hands...

1060
00:49:31,589 --> 00:49:32,959
in the air.

1061
00:49:32,960 --> 00:49:35,874
(After jumping, confidently walk to the front.)

1062
00:49:36,399 --> 00:49:37,898
I will make this as cool as possible.

1063
00:49:37,899 --> 00:49:39,544
All right. Let's go.

1064
00:49:39,969 --> 00:49:43,584
(He walks to the front in a cool way as he learned.)

1065
00:49:44,109 --> 00:49:45,845
(Kwang Soo suddenly attacks his neck.)

1066
00:49:46,040 --> 00:49:47,309
(What is that?)

1067
00:49:47,310 --> 00:49:49,079
- What? - It wasn't intentional.

1068
00:49:49,080 --> 00:49:51,409
- I was just doing my move. - You blocked me.

1069
00:49:51,410 --> 00:49:53,148
I do this when you pass by.

1070
00:49:53,149 --> 00:49:54,979
Am I supposed to get slapped as I walk by?

1071
00:49:54,980 --> 00:49:56,749
- Am I supposed to get slapped? - You should dodge.

1072
00:49:56,750 --> 00:50:00,258
If the members hold real knives, you will dodge well.

1073
00:50:00,259 --> 00:50:01,459
(Real knives?)

1074
00:50:01,460 --> 00:50:02,929
Real knives?

1075
00:50:02,930 --> 00:50:04,188
That would be funny.

1076
00:50:04,189 --> 00:50:05,959
(He will need to risk his life for a formation change.)

1077
00:50:05,960 --> 00:50:07,834
I will bring a knife next time.

1078
00:50:09,359 --> 00:50:10,874
That will get him to dodge you.

1079
00:50:12,669 --> 00:50:14,139
Make a line.

1080
00:50:14,140 --> 00:50:17,008
Haha is the very front.

1081
00:50:17,009 --> 00:50:18,845
Se Chan,

1082
00:50:18,910 --> 00:50:21,039
- you will stick out to the left. - To the left?

1083
00:50:21,040 --> 00:50:24,909
You will do this to Haha's chest.

1084
00:50:24,910 --> 00:50:28,449
1, 2, stop, stop. Okay.

1085
00:50:28,450 --> 00:50:30,389
A bit up.

1086
00:50:30,390 --> 00:50:32,825
- Should I raise my arm? - Raise it up to here.

1087
00:50:32,989 --> 00:50:34,794
One and... Okay.

1088
00:50:35,589 --> 00:50:37,028
(Jong Kook bursts out laughing.)

1089
00:50:37,029 --> 00:50:38,929
- That was nice. - Good work, everyone.

1090
00:50:38,930 --> 00:50:40,898
For this move,

1091
00:50:40,899 --> 00:50:44,269
only our arms should stick out. How about the head?

1092
00:50:44,270 --> 00:50:46,338
(Kwang Soo's head sticks out.)

1093
00:50:46,339 --> 00:50:47,644
Kwang Soo.

1094
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:49,809
I keep meeting your eyes.

1095
00:50:49,810 --> 00:50:51,468
His head is sticking out.

1096
00:50:51,469 --> 00:50:52,878
You are uselessly tall.

1097
00:50:52,879 --> 00:50:54,639
I suddenly realized that he is really tall.

1098
00:50:54,640 --> 00:50:56,449
Kwang Soo's head and our arms...

1099
00:50:56,450 --> 00:50:58,325
look like a centipede.

1100
00:50:59,210 --> 00:51:02,095
Kwang Soo's head and our arms look like a centipede.

1101
00:51:03,419 --> 00:51:05,025
- You are right. - Right?

1102
00:51:05,120 --> 00:51:06,188
You are right.

1103
00:51:06,189 --> 00:51:07,564
We are an insect.

1104
00:51:07,660 --> 00:51:09,088
Kwang Soo, get down.

1105
00:51:09,089 --> 00:51:10,088
(Kwang Soo, get down.)

1106
00:51:10,089 --> 00:51:11,289
(He gets down.)

1107
00:51:11,290 --> 00:51:13,798
5, 6, 7, 8.

1108
00:51:13,799 --> 00:51:15,959
1, 2, 3...

1109
00:51:15,960 --> 00:51:17,345
(They resume the practice.)

1110
00:51:17,799 --> 00:51:20,838
(Floundering)

1111
00:51:20,839 --> 00:51:22,909
6, 7...

1112
00:51:22,910 --> 00:51:25,468
Seok Jin.

1113
00:51:25,469 --> 00:51:27,715
- Get it together, Seok Jin. - Please.

1114
00:51:27,879 --> 00:51:29,385
Act your age.

1115
00:51:30,609 --> 00:51:33,354
- "Act your age." - I made one mistake so far!

1116
00:51:34,049 --> 00:51:35,394
Act your age.

1117
00:51:35,480 --> 00:51:37,718
Okay. Let's go. We can do this. We aren't fools.

1118
00:51:37,719 --> 00:51:39,595
Shut up during practice.

1119
00:51:41,060 --> 00:51:42,159
(He is strict to Seok Jin.)

1120
00:51:42,160 --> 00:51:44,204
Shut up and concentrate.

1121
00:51:45,089 --> 00:51:47,135
- I am a fan. - Seriously.

1122
00:51:47,259 --> 00:51:49,675
Left foot and right hand.

1123
00:51:49,770 --> 00:51:51,128
Pull and pull.

1124
00:51:51,129 --> 00:51:53,238
Then do this twice.

1125
00:51:53,239 --> 00:51:54,568
(This move involves powerful hip thrusts.)

1126
00:51:54,569 --> 00:51:56,238
I know this dance move!

1127
00:51:56,239 --> 00:51:58,639
If you bend your knees and move your hip,

1128
00:51:58,640 --> 00:52:00,938
you will get a hip-hop vibe.

1129
00:52:00,939 --> 00:52:02,238
- My back hurts. - It's hip-hop.

1130
00:52:02,239 --> 00:52:04,354
Is that hip-hop?

1131
00:52:05,649 --> 00:52:08,595
(This is hip-hop!)

1132
00:52:09,549 --> 00:52:12,389
- Is that hip-hop? - That looks dirty.

1133
00:52:12,390 --> 00:52:13,695
Don't do that.

1134
00:52:13,759 --> 00:52:15,959
Bend your knees.

1135
00:52:15,960 --> 00:52:17,764
Just do this.

1136
00:52:18,230 --> 00:52:19,334
My goodness.

1137
00:52:20,129 --> 00:52:21,575
He is the worst.

1138
00:52:21,660 --> 00:52:23,544
Stop it!

1139
00:52:24,200 --> 00:52:26,168
Kwang Soo, smile.

1140
00:52:26,169 --> 00:52:28,144
(I need to smile.)

1141
00:52:29,399 --> 00:52:30,568
Smile. Smile.

1142
00:52:30,569 --> 00:52:32,414
(Smiling)

1143
00:52:33,580 --> 00:52:37,084
(Kwang Soo's smile spreads happiness.)

1144
00:52:37,680 --> 00:52:40,119
(It looks fine when I smile, right?)

1145
00:52:40,120 --> 00:52:42,179
I am about to go crazy.

1146
00:52:42,180 --> 00:52:43,318
(A new type of dancer...)

1147
00:52:43,319 --> 00:52:44,865
- That was incredible. - My goodness.

1148
00:52:45,089 --> 00:52:46,088
(works hard today.)

1149
00:52:46,089 --> 00:52:47,218
I am not a fool.

1150
00:52:47,219 --> 00:52:48,588
- Okay. - It's the specialty time.

1151
00:52:48,589 --> 00:52:49,959
You will start from here.

1152
00:52:49,960 --> 00:52:51,758
We showed waves in the video,

1153
00:52:51,759 --> 00:52:55,429
but I am sure the audience wants to see specialties.

1154
00:52:55,430 --> 00:52:56,869
So we should do...

1155
00:52:56,870 --> 00:52:58,644
- freestyle dance. - Show what you want to show.

1156
00:52:58,770 --> 00:53:00,668
You should just keep this in mind.

1157
00:53:00,669 --> 00:53:04,238
If the last member finishes with the chin,

1158
00:53:04,239 --> 00:53:05,668
(They need to start with the last member's last move.)

1159
00:53:05,669 --> 00:53:07,584
- continue with the chin. - The chin.

1160
00:53:07,910 --> 00:53:10,449
(They begin to practice right away!)

1161
00:53:10,450 --> 00:53:11,608
My goodness.

1162
00:53:11,609 --> 00:53:12,778
There you go.

1163
00:53:12,779 --> 00:53:15,454
(They suddenly deliver the chin move.)

1164
00:53:16,750 --> 00:53:19,889
(They have good teamwork with things like this.)

1165
00:53:19,890 --> 00:53:21,334
This is fun.

1166
00:53:22,219 --> 00:53:24,834
(So Min tosses it to Lia!)

1167
00:53:25,230 --> 00:53:27,405
Lia went along with it. Lia went along with it.

1168
00:53:27,529 --> 00:53:30,044
(She is a true teacher.)

1169
00:53:30,399 --> 00:53:32,104
Lia went along with it.

1170
00:53:33,469 --> 00:53:35,615
If someone throws it with their shoulders,

1171
00:53:36,239 --> 00:53:37,914
the next person receives it with their shoulders.

1172
00:53:39,239 --> 00:53:40,615
Where are you going to toss it from?

1173
00:53:41,140 --> 00:53:42,485
I am going to do this for a long time.

1174
00:53:42,540 --> 00:53:44,979
Come on and toss it already.

1175
00:53:44,980 --> 00:53:47,119
I am going to do this for a minute.

1176
00:53:47,120 --> 00:53:48,349
- All right. - A minute.

1177
00:53:48,350 --> 00:53:49,494
What are you going to use?

1178
00:53:49,580 --> 00:53:50,949
Hurry up.

1179
00:53:50,950 --> 00:53:52,394
- Seriously. - What are you going to use?

1180
00:53:52,549 --> 00:53:53,994
He took it back.

1181
00:53:54,219 --> 00:53:55,659
- Hurry up. - Did he toss it?

1182
00:53:55,660 --> 00:53:56,834
Spit it in the air.

1183
00:53:57,330 --> 00:53:59,135
He spat it out. Haha ate it.

1184
00:53:59,290 --> 00:54:00,959
(Haha receives it with his mouth and shoot it out his bottom!)

1185
00:54:00,960 --> 00:54:02,305
(Se Chan receives it with his bottom and...)

1186
00:54:04,200 --> 00:54:06,468
- Se Chan! - What was that?

1187
00:54:06,469 --> 00:54:08,014
- It's hip-hop! - Hey!

1188
00:54:08,939 --> 00:54:11,668
(Complaints flood in due to his dirty hip thrust.)

1189
00:54:11,669 --> 00:54:12,968
What was that?

1190
00:54:12,969 --> 00:54:15,608
- It's hip-hop! Isn't that hip-hop? - How is that hip-hop?

1191
00:54:15,609 --> 00:54:17,878
- You said it's hip-hop. - How is that hip-hop?

1192
00:54:17,879 --> 00:54:19,249
You said it's hip-hop.

1193
00:54:19,250 --> 00:54:22,048
I am sorry. I apologize. I apologize.

1194
00:54:22,049 --> 00:54:23,119
I am sorry.

1195
00:54:23,120 --> 00:54:25,949
Decide which part of your body you will use to toss.

1196
00:54:25,950 --> 00:54:28,764
The one who tosses should decide.

1197
00:54:28,890 --> 00:54:30,628
I will receive it with my chest.

1198
00:54:30,629 --> 00:54:33,275
- Then go down. - Then I will toss it with my foot.

1199
00:54:33,330 --> 00:54:34,829
- Se Chan. - And out my face.

1200
00:54:34,830 --> 00:54:36,258
There you go. Toss with your face.

1201
00:54:36,259 --> 00:54:38,505
- I will receive with my face. - Receive it with your face.

1202
00:54:38,770 --> 00:54:41,269
Then I will toss with my shoulders.

1203
00:54:41,270 --> 00:54:42,874
- Shoulders. - Here I go.

1204
00:54:43,509 --> 00:54:44,938
It will come up and...

1205
00:54:44,939 --> 00:54:46,655
Why did you spit?

1206
00:54:46,739 --> 00:54:47,938
It will come up and...

1207
00:54:47,939 --> 00:54:49,485
(Spitting)

1208
00:54:49,509 --> 00:54:50,778
Why did you spit?

1209
00:54:50,779 --> 00:54:51,809
(Are you really going to spit?)

1210
00:54:51,810 --> 00:54:53,449
- Why did you spit? - I mean...

1211
00:54:53,450 --> 00:54:55,418
- Did you feel like spitting? - My goodness.

1212
00:54:55,419 --> 00:54:57,218
- I just felt like it. - Come on.

1213
00:54:57,219 --> 00:54:58,465
Okay.

1214
00:54:58,620 --> 00:55:02,164
- Receive it like this. - Receive and toss with your hips.

1215
00:55:02,390 --> 00:55:03,459
(Seok Jin receives with his hips.)

1216
00:55:03,460 --> 00:55:05,429
1, 2, 3, 4.

1217
00:55:05,430 --> 00:55:06,898
- Will you kick? - I have an idea.

1218
00:55:06,899 --> 00:55:09,028
Collapse as if he really kicked you.

1219
00:55:09,029 --> 00:55:10,275
Collapse.

1220
00:55:10,299 --> 00:55:11,499
That's easy.

1221
00:55:11,500 --> 00:55:12,699
(Kwang Soo pulls it off.)

1222
00:55:12,700 --> 00:55:14,668
He is good. He is good.

1223
00:55:14,669 --> 00:55:16,644
(I told you I can dance.)

1224
00:55:16,910 --> 00:55:18,338
- He is good. - He is good.

1225
00:55:18,339 --> 00:55:19,369
(Kwang Soo receives it with his legs...)

1226
00:55:19,370 --> 00:55:20,954
(and tosses it with his chest.)

1227
00:55:21,379 --> 00:55:23,608
I will do this.

1228
00:55:23,609 --> 00:55:24,778
- Now, - Then...

1229
00:55:24,779 --> 00:55:26,108
- I will receive it. - Show us what you learned.

1230
00:55:26,109 --> 00:55:27,918
Spin and...

1231
00:55:27,919 --> 00:55:29,079
(So Min finishes up with the Wheel Dance.)

1232
00:55:29,080 --> 00:55:31,148
Yes. That's good.

1233
00:55:31,149 --> 00:55:32,488
It's the Driving Dance.

1234
00:55:32,489 --> 00:55:34,095
(The practice for their specialties end.)

1235
00:55:36,660 --> 00:55:39,104
5, 6, 7, 8.

1236
00:55:42,299 --> 00:55:43,675
Come on up.

1237
00:55:44,629 --> 00:55:46,539
- 5, 6, 7, 8. - 5, 6, 7, 8.

1238
00:55:46,540 --> 00:55:48,275
- Put her down. - 1, 2, 3, 4.

1239
00:56:05,919 --> 00:56:08,418
Gather around.

1240
00:56:08,419 --> 00:56:10,889
All of you worked hard.

1241
00:56:10,890 --> 00:56:13,858
Please show us a great performance.

1242
00:56:13,859 --> 00:56:15,099
- Okay. - Okay.

1243
00:56:15,100 --> 00:56:16,568
Let's go.

1244
00:56:16,569 --> 00:56:18,929
1, 2, 3.

1245
00:56:18,930 --> 00:56:20,974
- Let's go! - Let's go!

1246
00:56:21,669 --> 00:56:25,584
(How will be the group dance the members spent 3 months on?)

1247
00:56:27,439 --> 00:56:29,579
(When the members appear on stage,)

1248
00:56:29,580 --> 00:56:33,124
(the audience cheers loudly.)

1249
00:56:34,020 --> 00:56:35,825
(The Running Man members are here!)

1250
00:56:36,850 --> 00:56:39,764
(They take their positions on the dark stage.)

1251
00:56:40,859 --> 00:56:42,365
My heart is about to burst.

1252
00:56:43,660 --> 00:56:47,028
(Both Lia outside the stage...)

1253
00:56:47,029 --> 00:56:51,845
(and the members on the stage are extremely nervous.)

1254
00:56:54,069 --> 00:56:57,914
(They feel like their hearts are about to burst.)

1255
00:57:00,310 --> 00:57:01,438
(It's the highlight everyone has been waiting for.)

1256
00:57:01,439 --> 00:57:02,655
I am so excited.

1257
00:57:03,779 --> 00:57:05,148
I think it will be cool.

1258
00:57:05,149 --> 00:57:08,925
(Will they make it through without a mistake?)

1259
00:57:12,390 --> 00:57:16,334
("Boom and Just Blow" by Running Man members)

1260
00:57:32,270 --> 00:57:33,838
(The strong intro...)

1261
00:57:33,839 --> 00:57:35,285
(makes everyone's jaw drop.)

1262
00:57:45,950 --> 00:57:48,735
(Se Chan manages to get through without getting hit by Kwang Soo!)

1263
00:57:57,870 --> 00:58:00,014
(They have perfect teamwork.)

1264
00:58:09,509 --> 00:58:11,325
(It's Seok Jin's time!)

1265
00:58:11,810 --> 00:58:13,755
(The audience watches in awe.)

1266
00:58:14,680 --> 00:58:16,418
(This is incredible.)

1267
00:58:16,419 --> 00:58:17,624
My goodness.

1268
00:58:34,339 --> 00:58:36,814
(When the music changes, the atmosphere becomes cheerful!)

1269
00:58:37,540 --> 00:58:40,715
(Jong Kook and So Min will show a difficult move.)

1270
00:58:48,520 --> 00:58:50,224
(It's a clean success.)

1271
00:58:52,589 --> 00:58:53,794
They did an amazing job.

1272
00:58:59,430 --> 00:59:02,329
(The teamwork they built up in the past 9 years...)

1273
00:59:02,330 --> 00:59:04,845
(explode on stage!)

1274
00:59:12,469 --> 00:59:14,285
(It's Ji Hyo and So Min's time.)

1275
00:59:14,540 --> 00:59:16,615
(Everyone cheers loudly!)

1276
00:59:20,680 --> 00:59:21,854
They are good.

1277
00:59:30,960 --> 00:59:35,135
(They show a sexy side they haven't shown on the show.)

1278
00:59:41,270 --> 00:59:42,974
(Here comes Kwang Soo!)

1279
00:59:47,410 --> 00:59:50,124
(They quickly make a line.)

1280
00:59:57,790 --> 01:00:00,358
(They pull off the line formation.)

1281
01:00:00,359 --> 01:00:01,834
They are incredible.

1282
01:00:17,339 --> 01:00:20,914
(The jump livens up the atmosphere.)

1283
01:00:33,859 --> 01:00:36,195
(It's time for their specialties!)

1284
01:00:49,399 --> 01:00:50,985
(So Min wraps up with the Wheel Dance.)

1285
01:00:51,939 --> 01:00:54,514
(Everyone's cheer explodes.)

1286
01:01:09,060 --> 01:01:13,635
(It's a cool ending for the 1st fan-meet in 9 years.)

1287
01:01:17,799 --> 01:01:22,615
(Even after the group dance, the members keep their positions.)

1288
01:01:24,669 --> 01:01:29,755
(The audience continues to cheer at their exceptional performance.)

1289
01:01:32,109 --> 01:01:34,449
(It was really cool!)

1290
01:01:34,450 --> 01:01:35,525
Bravo.

1291
01:01:36,680 --> 01:01:38,148
Ji Hyo can dance.

1292
01:01:38,149 --> 01:01:40,794
Ji Hyo's facial expressions were professional.

1293
01:01:40,960 --> 01:01:43,289
I would be in tears after a performance like that.

1294
01:01:43,290 --> 01:01:45,035
Wasn't it touching?

1295
01:01:45,259 --> 01:01:47,604
- I know. It makes you emotional. - Yes.

1296
01:01:49,460 --> 01:01:54,298
(Lia knows how hard the members practiced.)

1297
01:01:54,299 --> 01:01:58,039
(She feels thankful for the good performance...)

1298
01:01:58,040 --> 01:02:03,215
(and sorry for the members' hard work.)

1299
01:02:05,009 --> 01:02:08,119
(After a while,)

1300
01:02:08,120 --> 01:02:14,635
(the members on the stage smile.)

1301
01:02:16,160 --> 01:02:19,258
(Everyone wondered if they would be able to do it,)

1302
01:02:19,259 --> 01:02:23,644
(but the 8 members of Running Man showed an exceptional performance.)

1303
01:02:24,029 --> 01:02:28,144
(They encourage and support each other.)

1304
01:02:28,700 --> 01:02:31,309
- Thank you so much. - Thank you.

1305
01:02:31,310 --> 01:02:32,584
At the end,

1306
01:02:33,009 --> 01:02:36,139
we shouldn't have done that.

1307
01:02:36,140 --> 01:02:38,385
In an emotional state, we did something unsightly.

1308
01:02:38,680 --> 01:02:40,519
- We shouldn't have made a circle. - Seriously.

1309
01:02:40,520 --> 01:02:42,019
I told everyone...

1310
01:02:42,020 --> 01:02:43,749
- not to make a circle. - "Don't make a circle!"

1311
01:02:43,750 --> 01:02:45,148
- "Don't make a circle!" - Who initiated it?

1312
01:02:45,149 --> 01:02:46,349
Who initiated it?

1313
01:02:46,350 --> 01:02:48,289
- Who initiated it? - Who initiated the circle?

1314
01:02:48,290 --> 01:02:49,595
I am sorry.

1315
01:02:49,960 --> 01:02:51,528
In any case, for three months,

1316
01:02:51,529 --> 01:02:54,559
Lia, Jin Lee,

1317
01:02:54,560 --> 01:02:56,599
- You Jin, - You Jin.

1318
01:02:56,600 --> 01:02:59,068
and many other dancers...

1319
01:02:59,069 --> 01:03:01,568
helped us create this performance.

1320
01:03:01,569 --> 01:03:04,044
To be frank,

1321
01:03:04,140 --> 01:03:08,479
I am someone who is emotionally dry.

1322
01:03:08,480 --> 01:03:12,684
When the group dance ended and everyone clapped,

1323
01:03:13,149 --> 01:03:16,525
I suddenly felt emotional.

1324
01:03:16,850 --> 01:03:20,559
I felt that emotion thanks to you.

1325
01:03:20,560 --> 01:03:22,218
Thank you so much.

1326
01:03:22,219 --> 01:03:25,789
I haven't felt so emotional in 20 years.

1327
01:03:25,790 --> 01:03:27,059
It has been a while.

1328
01:03:27,060 --> 01:03:29,159
I hope you mean it.

1329
01:03:29,160 --> 01:03:30,269
It's real.

1330
01:03:30,270 --> 01:03:32,468
(He means it.)

1331
01:03:32,469 --> 01:03:34,369
My goodness. I...

1332
01:03:34,370 --> 01:03:35,668
What are you saying?

1333
01:03:35,669 --> 01:03:36,938
Are you calling me a liar?

1334
01:03:36,939 --> 01:03:38,468
Don't be angry.

1335
01:03:38,469 --> 01:03:40,309
- I am not angry. - Don't be angry.

1336
01:03:40,310 --> 01:03:42,938
- Seok Jin is rarely angry. - That's right.

1337
01:03:42,939 --> 01:03:44,909
- I am grateful for him. - He doesn't know anger.

1338
01:03:44,910 --> 01:03:46,124
Ji Hyo.

1339
01:03:46,779 --> 01:03:48,418
All right.

1340
01:03:48,419 --> 01:03:49,624
(All right.)

1341
01:03:50,950 --> 01:03:53,119
(Feeling grateful for the fans who supported the show,)

1342
01:03:53,120 --> 01:03:54,289
Thank you.

1343
01:03:54,290 --> 01:03:57,758
(Ji Hyo becomes speechless at the support of the fans.)

1344
01:03:57,759 --> 01:03:59,735
We promised not to cry.

1345
01:04:02,359 --> 01:04:04,474
This is exactly what Seok Jin wanted to do.

1346
01:04:04,669 --> 01:04:06,168
Ji Hyo did it perfectly.

1347
01:04:06,169 --> 01:04:08,039
It was so natural.

1348
01:04:08,040 --> 01:04:09,898
- That's right. - Seok Jin finished too quickly.

1349
01:04:09,899 --> 01:04:11,568
Seok Jin has artificial tears in his pocket,

1350
01:04:11,569 --> 01:04:13,755
- but he missed his chance. - It was really nice.

1351
01:04:14,739 --> 01:04:15,909
I...

1352
01:04:15,910 --> 01:04:19,209
(Ji Hyo tries to calm down,)

1353
01:04:19,210 --> 01:04:20,579
(but she can't.)

1354
01:04:20,580 --> 01:04:21,949
You did a good job.

1355
01:04:21,950 --> 01:04:23,354
You did a good job!

1356
01:04:23,790 --> 01:04:25,048
Thank you.

1357
01:04:25,049 --> 01:04:26,525
(Thank you.)

1358
01:04:26,750 --> 01:04:32,459
(Ji Hyo's short comment contains a lot of meanings.)

1359
01:04:32,460 --> 01:04:35,929
Ji Hyo became emotional.

1360
01:04:35,930 --> 01:04:37,505
Kwang Soo, please continue.

1361
01:04:37,930 --> 01:04:39,744
Kwang Soo isn't a fool!

1362
01:04:39,770 --> 01:04:41,168
What?

1363
01:04:41,169 --> 01:04:42,938
(Kwang Soo isn't a fool!)

1364
01:04:42,939 --> 01:04:44,468
- What? - Kwang Soo.

1365
01:04:44,469 --> 01:04:46,608
- Don't say that! - "Kwang Soo isn't a fool!"

1366
01:04:46,609 --> 01:04:49,354
- "Kwang Soo isn't a fool!" - How do you know that?

1367
01:04:49,410 --> 01:04:51,048
- "Kwang Soo isn't a fool!" - Why would you say...

1368
01:04:51,049 --> 01:04:52,048
something so obvious?

1369
01:04:52,049 --> 01:04:54,519
They know because they are big fans...

1370
01:04:54,520 --> 01:04:55,918
- of the show. - That makes sense.

1371
01:04:55,919 --> 01:04:57,789
- He said something so obvious. - They are viewers...

1372
01:04:57,790 --> 01:04:59,564
- of Running Man. - That's right.

1373
01:04:59,950 --> 01:05:01,959
- You know, - They are part of the family.

1374
01:05:01,960 --> 01:05:03,389
I would again like to say this as his close friend.

1375
01:05:03,390 --> 01:05:05,159
Kwang Soo is not a fool.

1376
01:05:05,160 --> 01:05:07,758
Why would you say something so obvious?

1377
01:05:07,759 --> 01:05:09,798
(Kwang Soo gets annoyed.)

1378
01:05:09,799 --> 01:05:11,528
- Of course, I am not a fool. - Please spread...

1379
01:05:11,529 --> 01:05:13,168
this information.

1380
01:05:13,169 --> 01:05:14,514
Why would they spread this information?

1381
01:05:15,200 --> 01:05:16,568
(We will be sure to spread this information.)

1382
01:05:16,569 --> 01:05:20,215
For 3 or 4 months,

1383
01:05:20,509 --> 01:05:22,639
we prepared hard...

1384
01:05:22,640 --> 01:05:25,249
whether the cameras were running or not.

1385
01:05:25,250 --> 01:05:27,148
A period of three months may seem short,

1386
01:05:27,149 --> 01:05:30,119
but it feels like a year went into this fan-meet...

1387
01:05:30,120 --> 01:05:31,119
What?

1388
01:05:31,120 --> 01:05:33,519
(What?)

1389
01:05:33,520 --> 01:05:35,095
(Jae Seok motions him to stop.)

1390
01:05:35,790 --> 01:05:36,789
Do you want me to hurry up?

1391
01:05:36,790 --> 01:05:38,028
- We are running out of time. - I just started.

1392
01:05:38,029 --> 01:05:39,159
They need to take public transportation.

1393
01:05:39,160 --> 01:05:40,358
- What? - Everyone...

1394
01:05:40,359 --> 01:05:43,059
They need to take public transportation. I am sorry.

1395
01:05:43,060 --> 01:05:44,128
- Public transportation... - Is it okay?

1396
01:05:44,129 --> 01:05:45,429
- Yes! - Yes!

1397
01:05:45,430 --> 01:05:47,168
(Kwang Soo is a fool, Jae Seok is a fool for his fans.)

1398
01:05:47,169 --> 01:05:49,639
As happy as we were,

1399
01:05:49,640 --> 01:05:52,108
we hope you would keep this memory for many years to come.

1400
01:05:52,109 --> 01:05:53,854
- Thank you. - Thank you.

1401
01:05:54,279 --> 01:05:55,639
(You were incredible.)

1402
01:05:55,640 --> 01:06:00,008
As always, thank you. We won't forget this moment.

1403
01:06:00,009 --> 01:06:03,849
We hope you will stay healthy and happy.

1404
01:06:03,850 --> 01:06:08,059
The last song is the theme song that came to be after nine years.

1405
01:06:08,060 --> 01:06:10,758
Jung Joon Il composed "I Like You".

1406
01:06:10,759 --> 01:06:12,389
It's a stylish song.

1407
01:06:12,390 --> 01:06:13,959
- That's right. - It's quite nice.

1408
01:06:13,960 --> 01:06:15,135
That's right.

1409
01:06:16,399 --> 01:06:18,869
(The theme song was composed for the fan-meet.)

1410
01:06:18,870 --> 01:06:20,874
- Who will compose the theme song? - The theme song?

1411
01:06:20,969 --> 01:06:23,744
(Then a talented singer-songwriter appeared for the special task.)

1412
01:06:24,469 --> 01:06:26,744
(Composer Jung Joon Il)

1413
01:06:27,509 --> 01:06:32,255
(Members write lyrics for the theme song.)

1414
01:06:32,549 --> 01:06:37,224
(They do their best and finish recording.)

1415
01:06:38,620 --> 01:06:42,535
(Members' first theme song made with 9 years of Running Man)

1416
01:06:45,189 --> 01:06:48,934
(How did it turn out?)

1417
01:07:01,580 --> 01:07:05,155
("I Like You" by Running Man)

1418
01:07:25,100 --> 01:07:27,345
(Song Van)

1419
01:08:26,489 --> 01:08:28,499
(It's okay, stay strong)

1420
01:08:28,500 --> 01:08:33,244
(I will run with you)

1421
01:09:02,129 --> 01:09:07,514
(That's how we became one)

1422
01:09:10,810 --> 01:09:16,108
(Now I will be on your side)

1423
01:09:16,109 --> 01:09:19,179
(I can't understand everything)

1424
01:09:19,180 --> 01:09:24,894
(But I will lean on you little closer)

1425
01:09:24,919 --> 01:09:29,059
(Because I like you)

1426
01:09:29,060 --> 01:09:34,635
(Difficult today and tomorrow)

1427
01:09:35,029 --> 01:09:37,199
(It's okay, stay strong)

1428
01:09:37,200 --> 01:09:41,914
(I will run with you)

1429
01:09:52,980 --> 01:09:58,318
(That's why we shone much brighter)

1430
01:09:58,319 --> 01:10:01,764
(Remember us)

1431
01:10:01,919 --> 01:10:04,604
(His standing wasn't planned.)

1432
01:10:04,890 --> 01:10:07,135
(There he goes again.)

1433
01:10:08,060 --> 01:10:10,575
(Remember my high note.)

1434
01:10:20,569 --> 01:10:23,438
(Someday)

1435
01:10:23,439 --> 01:10:29,419
(On the day we stop this walk)

1436
01:10:29,420 --> 01:10:35,558
(Thank you so much, I was you)

1437
01:10:35,559 --> 01:10:39,829
(The day when we cried until our eyes hurt)

1438
01:10:39,830 --> 01:10:44,275
(The day we could laugh even though it rained)

1439
01:10:44,929 --> 01:10:50,644
(They never expressed their true feelings over the last 9 years.)

1440
01:10:53,340 --> 01:10:59,879
(All the days are soft and dry)

1441
01:10:59,880 --> 01:11:04,365
(I like you)

1442
01:11:05,420 --> 01:11:06,988
(The first song they sing to each other after 9 years)

1443
01:11:06,989 --> 01:11:08,795
- We love you. - Thank you.

1444
01:11:09,019 --> 01:11:10,464
- I like you. - Thank you.

1445
01:11:10,489 --> 01:11:11,934
Thank you.

1446
01:11:11,960 --> 01:11:13,988
- Thank you. - Thank you.

1447
01:11:13,989 --> 01:11:15,898
- Thank you. - Kwang Soo, pay the comedian fee.

1448
01:11:15,899 --> 01:11:16,928
What?

1449
01:11:16,929 --> 01:11:18,898
- Thank you. - Thank you.

1450
01:11:18,899 --> 01:11:21,075
- Thank you. - Thank you.

1451
01:11:21,139 --> 01:11:22,474
Thank you so much.

1452
01:11:23,439 --> 01:11:25,039
- We won't forget it. - Goodness.

1453
01:11:25,040 --> 01:11:26,339
Thank you very much.

1454
01:11:26,340 --> 01:11:28,155
(They encourage and cheer each other with their looks.)

1455
01:11:28,309 --> 01:11:31,455
I'm so grateful that I don't know what to say.

1456
01:11:31,479 --> 01:11:34,325
- Seriously. - Song Ji Hyo is my type.

1457
01:11:35,019 --> 01:11:37,594
(A male audience shouts, "Song Ji Hyo is my type.")

1458
01:11:38,220 --> 01:11:39,348
(His confession stops her tears.)

1459
01:11:39,349 --> 01:11:41,535
- Song Ji Hyo is my type. - Thank you.

1460
01:11:41,859 --> 01:11:44,405
Please respond to "Song Ji Hyo is my type."

1461
01:11:45,029 --> 01:11:46,735
You're my type too.

1462
01:11:47,160 --> 01:11:49,028
(His wish is granted.)

1463
01:11:49,029 --> 01:11:50,205
Thank you.

1464
01:11:51,170 --> 01:11:54,669
This is our ninth anniversary.

1465
01:11:54,670 --> 01:11:56,299
- 10th anniversary. - 10th or 20th anniversary.

1466
01:11:56,300 --> 01:11:57,644
Until the day when...

1467
01:11:57,670 --> 01:11:59,245
Seok Jin turns 100 years old.

1468
01:11:59,769 --> 01:12:01,014
Until that day.

1469
01:12:01,880 --> 01:12:05,308
I don't know that it'll be possible for me.

1470
01:12:05,309 --> 01:12:06,579
I don't know if it's possible.

1471
01:12:06,580 --> 01:12:08,619
- On the day Seok Jin turns 80, - 80.

1472
01:12:08,620 --> 01:12:10,249
we'll come back here.

1473
01:12:10,250 --> 01:12:12,619
That's possible because it'll be soon.

1474
01:12:12,620 --> 01:12:13,988
It's possible.

1475
01:12:13,989 --> 01:12:15,219
It's coming up soon.

1476
01:12:15,220 --> 01:12:17,659
We'd like to thank you again.

1477
01:12:17,660 --> 01:12:19,329
I thought of the spy at this moment.

1478
01:12:19,330 --> 01:12:20,898
I forgot to say it.

1479
01:12:20,899 --> 01:12:22,259
- Spy? - I forgot.

1480
01:12:22,260 --> 01:12:23,428
There's a spy.

1481
01:12:23,429 --> 01:12:24,768
I thought of the spy all of a sudden.

1482
01:12:24,769 --> 01:12:25,898
- That's right. - Who's the spy?

1483
01:12:25,899 --> 01:12:27,699
I had forgotten about it.

1484
01:12:27,700 --> 01:12:29,214
I thought of it all of a sudden.

1485
01:12:29,340 --> 01:12:30,598
- I think I know who it is. - Why?

1486
01:12:30,599 --> 01:12:31,669
As I was thinking...

1487
01:12:31,670 --> 01:12:32,839
I'd really like to know.

1488
01:12:32,840 --> 01:12:34,509
Do you know who the spy is?

1489
01:12:34,510 --> 01:12:36,178
(The audience knows who the spy is.)

1490
01:12:36,179 --> 01:12:37,438
That's amazing.

1491
01:12:37,439 --> 01:12:39,585
- They know. - Lee Kwang Soo.

1492
01:12:39,609 --> 01:12:41,749
(Is Kwang Soo the spy?)

1493
01:12:41,750 --> 01:12:42,854
Is it Kwang Soo?

1494
01:12:42,920 --> 01:12:44,049
- Kwang Soo? - Kwang Soo?

1495
01:12:44,050 --> 01:12:45,295
Is it?

1496
01:12:46,090 --> 01:12:47,295
What about Kwang Soo?

1497
01:12:47,519 --> 01:12:48,764
- Kwang Soo? - Me?

1498
01:12:48,920 --> 01:12:50,134
Is it Kwang Soo?

1499
01:12:50,290 --> 01:12:51,759
- Hey, you. - You're starting again.

1500
01:12:51,760 --> 01:12:52,988
- It's not me. - Is it not?

1501
01:12:52,989 --> 01:12:54,829
- I swear that I'm not. - Among the members,

1502
01:12:54,830 --> 01:12:57,898
we suspect that it's Seok Jin.

1503
01:12:57,899 --> 01:13:00,398
- I got a very definite hint. - For now,

1504
01:13:00,399 --> 01:13:01,974
here's the hint that we got.

1505
01:13:02,500 --> 01:13:04,808
- Here's the hint. - Friday instead of Monday.

1506
01:13:04,809 --> 01:13:06,638
He prefers Friday to Monday.

1507
01:13:06,639 --> 01:13:07,839
"The spy buys coffee once in a while."

1508
01:13:07,840 --> 01:13:09,539
"The spy has been on Running Man for nine years."

1509
01:13:09,540 --> 01:13:11,778
- The spy prefers cafes. - The spy prefers cafes.

1510
01:13:11,779 --> 01:13:13,579
- The spy doesn't like restaurants. - Right.

1511
01:13:13,580 --> 01:13:15,079
"The spy can be with balls,"

1512
01:13:15,080 --> 01:13:16,678
- "but not dice." - "but not dice."

1513
01:13:16,679 --> 01:13:19,219
Also, the spy is lucky today.

1514
01:13:19,220 --> 01:13:21,089
- Right. - Who got the hint about Monday?

1515
01:13:21,090 --> 01:13:23,865
- I think I know. - The spy likes Mondays.

1516
01:13:24,330 --> 01:13:25,688
Friday, Seok Jin.

1517
01:13:25,689 --> 01:13:27,205
- What? - The Chinese character.

1518
01:13:28,130 --> 01:13:29,659
(If the Chinese character for Friday is the same as "metal",)

1519
01:13:29,660 --> 01:13:30,875
Kim Jong Kook?

1520
01:13:30,970 --> 01:13:32,129
- Jong Kook? - That's what I think.

1521
01:13:32,130 --> 01:13:34,469
- Restaurants. - He runs a restaurant like me.

1522
01:13:34,470 --> 01:13:36,499
(Jong Kook who runs a restaurant seems relaxed for some reason.)

1523
01:13:36,500 --> 01:13:37,638
Wow.

1524
01:13:37,639 --> 01:13:39,469
(Was it you, Jong Kook?)

1525
01:13:39,470 --> 01:13:40,909
- What about Kwang Soo? - What?

1526
01:13:40,910 --> 01:13:42,485
(Jong Kook stands out all of a sudden.)

1527
01:13:43,510 --> 01:13:44,655
What about Kwang Soo?

1528
01:13:44,979 --> 01:13:48,079
(The spy is Kwang Soo.)

1529
01:13:48,080 --> 01:13:49,219
Is it Kwang Soo?

1530
01:13:49,220 --> 01:13:50,495
It's not me.

1531
01:13:50,989 --> 01:13:52,419
- It's not me. - Is Kwang Soo the spy?

1532
01:13:52,420 --> 01:13:53,764
(Flustered)

1533
01:13:53,989 --> 01:13:55,995
- Is Kwang Soo the spy? - It's not me.

1534
01:13:56,720 --> 01:13:58,104
What about the hints?

1535
01:13:58,330 --> 01:14:00,329
- Let's end this. - Okay.

1536
01:14:00,330 --> 01:14:01,459
We'll wrap this up quickly.

1537
01:14:01,460 --> 01:14:03,235
For now,

1538
01:14:03,300 --> 01:14:05,068
- the spy likes Fridays. - I put mine in.

1539
01:14:05,069 --> 01:14:06,974
(A person who has no idea and another who got the answer)

1540
01:14:07,000 --> 01:14:08,214
I put mine in.

1541
01:14:08,700 --> 01:14:10,674
- The spy likes cafes. - I put mine in too.

1542
01:14:11,040 --> 01:14:12,869
- I'll put it in too. - I'll follow my feelings.

1543
01:14:12,870 --> 01:14:14,085
Also...

1544
01:14:14,710 --> 01:14:16,108
- I wrote someone's name. - I put mine in.

1545
01:14:16,109 --> 01:14:17,514
I don't know. Let's just do it.

1546
01:14:17,540 --> 01:14:19,549
Jae Seok,

1547
01:14:19,550 --> 01:14:21,754
Kwang Soo, and Se Chan wrote...

1548
01:14:21,880 --> 01:14:24,449
- Seok Jin as the spy. - Seok Jin? Let's get together.

1549
01:14:24,450 --> 01:14:25,988
- Come on. - Here's why.

1550
01:14:25,989 --> 01:14:27,589
Come on. He was very strange today.

1551
01:14:27,590 --> 01:14:28,959
(Is it Seok Jin who cleared the spy mission?)

1552
01:14:28,960 --> 01:14:32,188
Seok Jin is on a radio show.

1553
01:14:32,189 --> 01:14:34,329
- He likes Fridays very much. - Right.

1554
01:14:34,330 --> 01:14:36,358
Seok Jin acted strangely in the waiting room.

1555
01:14:36,359 --> 01:14:37,869
- He took photos of us. - He took photos of us.

1556
01:14:37,870 --> 01:14:39,728
- He was so passionate today. - If he's not the spy,

1557
01:14:39,729 --> 01:14:41,699
I'm sorry, but I promised to hit him after the show.

1558
01:14:41,700 --> 01:14:42,938
(I'm sorry but I promised to hit him after the show.)

1559
01:14:42,939 --> 01:14:44,409
Really, Seok Jin?

1560
01:14:44,410 --> 01:14:47,238
- What's next? - Seok Jin, So Min, and Haha...

1561
01:14:47,239 --> 01:14:48,839
- picked Jong Kook. - Right?

1562
01:14:48,840 --> 01:14:50,455
It's because of this hint.

1563
01:14:51,750 --> 01:14:53,808
"The spy suits Friday, but doesn't suit Sunday."

1564
01:14:53,809 --> 01:14:55,054
He also likes cafes.

1565
01:14:55,220 --> 01:14:56,495
- He likes cafes. - Cafes.

1566
01:14:56,620 --> 01:14:57,848
- I see. - Right.

1567
01:14:57,849 --> 01:14:59,295
Only Ji Hyo picked...

1568
01:14:59,720 --> 01:15:01,064
Haha.

1569
01:15:01,819 --> 01:15:03,659
- I knew it. - Why did you pick him?

1570
01:15:03,660 --> 01:15:05,634
Seok Jin doesn't like coffee.

1571
01:15:05,859 --> 01:15:07,598
Jong Kook doesn't suit Friday either.

1572
01:15:07,599 --> 01:15:09,775
I narrowed it down to Haha.

1573
01:15:10,559 --> 01:15:12,775
Jong Kook...

1574
01:15:12,899 --> 01:15:14,568
- Whom did you pick? - arrested...

1575
01:15:14,569 --> 01:15:15,738
the spy.

1576
01:15:15,739 --> 01:15:17,884
(Jong Kook arrested the spy.)

1577
01:15:18,540 --> 01:15:21,178
(Only Jong Kook successfully arrested the spy.)

1578
01:15:21,179 --> 01:15:23,514
Jong Kook? Whom did you write?

1579
01:15:23,840 --> 01:15:27,995
(Did he arrest the spy? Who could it be?)

1580
01:15:28,649 --> 01:15:31,894
(Only Jong Kook is exempted from the whip cream penalty.)

1581
01:15:32,050 --> 01:15:33,195
Who is it?

1582
01:15:33,489 --> 01:15:34,858
- Is it you? - It's not us.

1583
01:15:34,859 --> 01:15:36,064
Right?

1584
01:15:36,519 --> 01:15:39,205
(Praise Jong Kook, Jong Kook.)

1585
01:15:39,630 --> 01:15:42,835
(As always, Jong Kook is the winner.)

1586
01:15:43,859 --> 01:15:45,205
Who is it?

1587
01:15:45,269 --> 01:15:46,598
- Is it Ji Hyo? - Really?

1588
01:15:46,599 --> 01:15:47,945
- Who is it? - Is it Ji Hyo?

1589
01:15:48,099 --> 01:15:49,814
In the count of three,

1590
01:15:49,840 --> 01:15:54,714
the audience will announce today's spy.

1591
01:15:55,239 --> 01:15:57,238
Who's today's spy? One.

1592
01:15:57,239 --> 01:15:58,778
(The spy performed most passionately today.)

1593
01:15:58,779 --> 01:15:59,848
Two.

1594
01:15:59,849 --> 01:16:01,318
(Who is the spy?)

1595
01:16:01,319 --> 01:16:02,394
Three.

1596
01:16:02,550 --> 01:16:04,249
(We're the spy.)

1597
01:16:04,250 --> 01:16:05,365
I knew it.

1598
01:16:06,250 --> 01:16:08,188
(The spy is the fans.)

1599
01:16:08,189 --> 01:16:09,335
I knew it.

1600
01:16:09,889 --> 01:16:12,004
- He wrote it. - I wrote it.

1601
01:16:12,029 --> 01:16:13,459
It's the fans.

1602
01:16:13,460 --> 01:16:14,604
Is that right?

1603
01:16:14,800 --> 01:16:16,058
I almost wrote it.

1604
01:16:16,059 --> 01:16:17,634
(The fans and the staff had a secret meeting beforehand.)

1605
01:16:18,330 --> 01:16:19,844
Hello, everyone.

1606
01:16:20,330 --> 01:16:22,499
As today is Running Man's fan-meet,

1607
01:16:22,500 --> 01:16:23,714
today's spy is...

1608
01:16:24,170 --> 01:16:26,945
(You're the spy.)

1609
01:16:27,010 --> 01:16:29,714
(Are we the spy?)

1610
01:16:30,880 --> 01:16:32,449
As you're the spy,

1611
01:16:32,450 --> 01:16:35,094
you have to clear a hidden mission.

1612
01:16:35,779 --> 01:16:38,449
(The spy's mission is to be the most passionate today.)

1613
01:16:38,450 --> 01:16:42,394
Your mission is to enjoy yourselves most passionately today.

1614
01:16:45,429 --> 01:16:46,964
Was it you, the fans?

1615
01:16:47,229 --> 01:16:48,575
I almost wrote it.

1616
01:16:49,160 --> 01:16:50,928
(I thought about it for a while.)

1617
01:16:50,929 --> 01:16:52,045
Goodness.

1618
01:16:52,529 --> 01:16:54,839
- That's right. - It's all of you!

1619
01:16:54,840 --> 01:16:56,598
I thought that couldn't be true.

1620
01:16:56,599 --> 01:16:59,339
- It's true. - I was like "No way".

1621
01:16:59,340 --> 01:17:02,138
When I heard the hint that the spy is lucky today,

1622
01:17:02,139 --> 01:17:05,224
I wondered who was lucky today. I was watching them.

1623
01:17:05,479 --> 01:17:07,625
They were picked to be here.

1624
01:17:08,220 --> 01:17:10,155
- What? - That's true.

1625
01:17:10,279 --> 01:17:11,988
They're lucky.

1626
01:17:11,989 --> 01:17:13,919
The spy likes balls.

1627
01:17:13,920 --> 01:17:15,264
Was it ballpoint pen?

1628
01:17:15,359 --> 01:17:16,388
That's right.

1629
01:17:16,389 --> 01:17:17,419
- Isn't it ballpoint pen? - What ballpoint pen?

1630
01:17:17,420 --> 01:17:19,159
"The spy can be with balls, but not dice."

1631
01:17:19,160 --> 01:17:20,558
- Ballpoint pen. - Ballpoint pen.

1632
01:17:20,559 --> 01:17:22,598
- Whose ballpoint pen? - What's a ballpoint pen?

1633
01:17:22,599 --> 01:17:25,098
The coffee hint meant the coffee truck the fans sometimes send.

1634
01:17:25,099 --> 01:17:26,699
- They do. - Cafe.

1635
01:17:26,700 --> 01:17:29,098
- What's that? - Does it mean fan cafe?

1636
01:17:29,099 --> 01:17:31,068
- Yes, it's fan cafe. - Ballpoint pen?

1637
01:17:31,069 --> 01:17:33,344
- Fan cafe? - Fan cafe.

1638
01:17:33,609 --> 01:17:35,155
- Also, - Right, it's fan cafe.

1639
01:17:35,309 --> 01:17:37,485
- Friday. - Friday, frying pan.

1640
01:17:38,479 --> 01:17:39,509
What did you say?

1641
01:17:39,510 --> 01:17:42,749
(Is it frying pan because it's Friday?)

1642
01:17:42,750 --> 01:17:45,394
- How would we know that? - Isn't that harsh?

1643
01:17:45,689 --> 01:17:47,449
- Boo. - That's harsh.

1644
01:17:47,450 --> 01:17:48,858
Frying pan was too harsh.

1645
01:17:48,859 --> 01:17:52,705
I thought it was because people like Fridays in general.

1646
01:17:52,859 --> 01:17:55,759
Do we finish after getting penalized?

1647
01:17:55,760 --> 01:17:58,545
Whip cream penalty is prepared for only four members.

1648
01:17:58,630 --> 01:18:00,304
Do we have a chance?

1649
01:18:00,870 --> 01:18:01,898
We're picking.

1650
01:18:01,899 --> 01:18:05,445
There are 4 blue and 3 red in the spoon container.

1651
01:18:05,609 --> 01:18:08,278
Those who pick 4 blue spoons will be penalized with whip cream.

1652
01:18:08,279 --> 01:18:09,714
Okay.

1653
01:18:09,910 --> 01:18:12,608
- Let's start with Haha. - Don't look right now.

1654
01:18:12,609 --> 01:18:13,955
Don't look right now.

1655
01:18:14,849 --> 01:18:16,295
Here you go, Kwang Soo.

1656
01:18:16,479 --> 01:18:18,719
The unlucky people have gathered again.

1657
01:18:18,720 --> 01:18:19,988
Today...

1658
01:18:19,989 --> 01:18:21,764
- Including me... - Seriously.

1659
01:18:21,960 --> 01:18:23,459
Today, I think...

1660
01:18:23,460 --> 01:18:24,928
(Who will be the three going home dry?)

1661
01:18:24,929 --> 01:18:26,688
I have a strange feeling it won't be me.

1662
01:18:26,689 --> 01:18:27,928
I bet mine is red.

1663
01:18:27,929 --> 01:18:29,858
Let's look one by one.

1664
01:18:29,859 --> 01:18:31,775
Start with Haha. 1, 2, 3.

1665
01:18:33,370 --> 01:18:34,499
It's blue.

1666
01:18:34,500 --> 01:18:35,499
(Haha is chosen to be penalized.)

1667
01:18:35,500 --> 01:18:37,045
- Okay. - Okay.

1668
01:18:37,540 --> 01:18:39,869
(They cheer for the first person to sacrifice.)

1669
01:18:39,870 --> 01:18:41,909
- Is it blue? He'll be penalized. - Ji Hyo.

1670
01:18:41,910 --> 01:18:43,608
- Is blue being penalized? - Yes.

1671
01:18:43,609 --> 01:18:45,648
1, 2, 3.

1672
01:18:45,649 --> 01:18:47,709
- Let it be blue. - I'm unlucky with this.

1673
01:18:47,710 --> 01:18:49,119
- That's right. - Okay.

1674
01:18:49,120 --> 01:18:50,549
(Ji Hyo is chosen to be penalized.)

1675
01:18:50,550 --> 01:18:52,348
(Ji Hyo joins to be penalized.)

1676
01:18:52,349 --> 01:18:53,818
- There are two left. - What?

1677
01:18:53,819 --> 01:18:55,058
Did Ji Hyo get blue?

1678
01:18:55,059 --> 01:18:56,688
- Ji Hyo picked blue? - Seok Jin.

1679
01:18:56,689 --> 01:18:57,988
Seok Jin, it'll be amazing...

1680
01:18:57,989 --> 01:19:00,358
- if the four in a row are selected. - I hope it'll be consecutive.

1681
01:19:00,359 --> 01:19:02,104
Seok Jin, 1, 2, 3.

1682
01:19:02,729 --> 01:19:04,928
(Seok Jin survives.)

1683
01:19:04,929 --> 01:19:06,299
(Seok Jin gets lucky without any consideration.)

1684
01:19:06,300 --> 01:19:08,174
- It's not fun, is it? - No.

1685
01:19:08,239 --> 01:19:09,969
- There are two left. - Jae Seok.

1686
01:19:09,970 --> 01:19:11,045
(These two are next.)

1687
01:19:11,269 --> 01:19:12,808
- Lee Kwang Soo. - Lee Kwang Soo.

1688
01:19:12,809 --> 01:19:14,579
- There are two left. - Lee Kwang Soo.

1689
01:19:14,580 --> 01:19:16,579
- Yu Jae Seok. - There are two spoons left.

1690
01:19:16,580 --> 01:19:18,778
- Kwang Soo. - Let's do it together.

1691
01:19:18,779 --> 01:19:20,949
- We'll reveal it together. - It's over if both of you are blue.

1692
01:19:20,950 --> 01:19:23,049
It's over if both of us have blue.

1693
01:19:23,050 --> 01:19:25,224
- 1, 2, 3. - Please.

1694
01:19:25,989 --> 01:19:29,219
(Only Kwang Soo is selected to be penalized.)

1695
01:19:29,220 --> 01:19:30,365
Three.

1696
01:19:30,590 --> 01:19:32,459
(He enters the class live.)

1697
01:19:32,460 --> 01:19:33,835
I knew it, Kwang Soo.

1698
01:19:34,899 --> 01:19:36,428
It was expected.

1699
01:19:36,429 --> 01:19:37,875
(It was expected.)

1700
01:19:38,130 --> 01:19:39,428
(Fans' big picture becomes true.)

1701
01:19:39,429 --> 01:19:40,528
Look at that.

1702
01:19:40,529 --> 01:19:42,568
Se Chan and So Min are next.

1703
01:19:42,569 --> 01:19:44,199
- One of them will survive. - Please.

1704
01:19:44,200 --> 01:19:45,709
- Please. - Do we do it together?

1705
01:19:45,710 --> 01:19:47,014
One of you will survive.

1706
01:19:47,040 --> 01:19:49,738
- 1, 2. - So Min.

1707
01:19:49,739 --> 01:19:54,108
- So Min, So Min. - So Min, So Min.

1708
01:19:54,109 --> 01:19:56,195
- 1, 2, 3. - Okay.

1709
01:19:56,750 --> 01:19:58,049
(So Min is selected for the penalty.)

1710
01:19:58,050 --> 01:19:59,865
Okay.

1711
01:20:01,319 --> 01:20:03,934
(So Min couldn't get away from the fans' curse.)

1712
01:20:04,989 --> 01:20:06,764
Scream!

1713
01:20:06,960 --> 01:20:09,398
(Things turn out as the fans wish.)

1714
01:20:09,399 --> 01:20:10,659
I got dizzy all of a sudden.

1715
01:20:10,660 --> 01:20:11,869
Seriously.

1716
01:20:11,870 --> 01:20:14,228
Before the penalty,

1717
01:20:14,229 --> 01:20:17,775
I'll introduce the artists who were with us today.

1718
01:20:18,309 --> 01:20:19,568
(Artists who collaborated today come on stage.)

1719
01:20:19,569 --> 01:20:21,714
Please come out on stage.

1720
01:20:21,979 --> 01:20:24,079
You worked very hard.

1721
01:20:24,080 --> 01:20:26,379
- Apink. - Even though...

1722
01:20:26,380 --> 01:20:28,394
everyone was busy,

1723
01:20:28,479 --> 01:20:31,388
they took the time and performed with us today.

1724
01:20:31,389 --> 01:20:34,659
Please give a round of applause...

1725
01:20:34,660 --> 01:20:36,858
to everyone who was with us including Gummy.

1726
01:20:36,859 --> 01:20:38,104
Thank you.

1727
01:20:41,130 --> 01:20:42,199
All right.

1728
01:20:42,200 --> 01:20:43,928
(The whip cream penalty is ready.)

1729
01:20:43,929 --> 01:20:47,245
Let's count to three together.

1730
01:20:47,470 --> 01:20:48,799
Are you ready?

1731
01:20:48,800 --> 01:20:50,214
- Yes. - Yes.

1732
01:20:50,340 --> 01:20:51,768
- 1. - 1.

1733
01:20:51,769 --> 01:20:53,108
- 2. - 2.

1734
01:20:53,109 --> 01:20:54,585
- 3! - 3!

1735
01:20:57,809 --> 01:20:59,025
Three!

1736
01:20:59,880 --> 01:21:02,354
(It's a successful and refreshing finale.)

1737
01:21:03,220 --> 01:21:05,625
(That's amazing.)

1738
01:21:06,220 --> 01:21:08,295
(That's worth a photo.)

1739
01:21:09,489 --> 01:21:12,165
(Watching members get penalized makes them the happiest.)

1740
01:21:13,429 --> 01:21:15,728
(It's time to appreciate the members covered in white.)

1741
01:21:15,729 --> 01:21:17,235
So Min got hit directly.

1742
01:21:17,429 --> 01:21:19,268
So Min got hit directly today.

1743
01:21:19,269 --> 01:21:21,068
- They got hit directly. - Ji Hyo.

1744
01:21:21,069 --> 01:21:22,915
Ji Hyo got hit directly today.

1745
01:21:23,500 --> 01:21:26,638
Everyone, you were with us today.

1746
01:21:26,639 --> 01:21:29,039
We'll say goodbye now.

1747
01:21:29,040 --> 01:21:30,379
Thank you, everyone.

1748
01:21:30,380 --> 01:21:32,278
- Thank you. - Thank you.

1749
01:21:32,279 --> 01:21:33,955
Thank you.

1750
01:21:35,280 --> 01:21:38,825
(Although they were awkward and may have lacked in areas,)

1751
01:21:39,049 --> 01:21:42,695
(the fan-meet was possible with their gratitude for the fans.)

1752
01:21:42,920 --> 01:21:47,035
(Thank you for being with us today. We'll be back again.)

1753
01:21:48,599 --> 01:21:51,968
Thank you for leading Running Man for nine years.

1754
01:21:51,969 --> 01:21:54,105
I'll continue to enjoy it.

1755
01:21:54,170 --> 01:21:56,298
I hope that it continues longer...

1756
01:21:56,299 --> 01:21:58,685
so that we can come back with my second child.

1757
01:21:58,809 --> 01:22:00,485
Please continue for a long time.

1758
01:22:00,570 --> 01:22:03,754
I'm grateful because they prepared a lot.

1759
01:22:04,509 --> 01:22:07,725
(We thank everyone who was with us for the fan-meet.)

1760
01:22:11,790 --> 01:22:14,489
(Their vacation starts after the fan-meet.)

1761
01:22:14,490 --> 01:22:17,065
(They go to a vacation spot together.)

1762
01:22:17,290 --> 01:22:20,159
(What awaits them is the smell of a field.)

1763
01:22:20,160 --> 01:22:23,004
(They're flustered by a new type of vacation.)

1764
01:22:23,200 --> 01:22:25,928
(Yu Jae Seok, what's the point of playing?)

1765
01:22:25,929 --> 01:22:27,245
(When will we eat?)

1766
01:22:27,330 --> 01:22:29,438
(Eat as much as you want.)

1767
01:22:29,439 --> 01:22:31,468
(Eat as much as you can catch.)

1768
01:22:31,469 --> 01:22:32,638
(Even if they can't catch anything,)

1769
01:22:32,639 --> 01:22:33,985
(it's too early to be disappointed.)

1770
01:22:34,139 --> 01:22:36,785
(A secret guest comes to comfort them.)

1771
01:22:37,639 --> 01:22:40,554
(They're speechless due to their eventful vacation.)

1772
01:22:40,710 --> 01:22:44,454
(What's the vacation under the veil?)

1773
01:22:44,580 --> 01:22:46,725
