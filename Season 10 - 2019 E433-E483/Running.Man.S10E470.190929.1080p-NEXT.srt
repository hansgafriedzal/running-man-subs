1
00:00:06,260 --> 00:00:07,988
- Hello. - Hi.

2
00:00:07,989 --> 00:00:10,504
- Hello. - Hello.

3
00:00:10,890 --> 00:00:12,165
Hi.

4
00:00:12,659 --> 00:00:13,805
Hello.

5
00:00:14,499 --> 00:00:16,404
(What?)

6
00:00:16,630 --> 00:00:18,045
- Hi. - Hello.

7
00:00:18,370 --> 00:00:19,799
Right. This will air after the fan-meet.

8
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:22,545
(A cheerful greeting with the group choreography)

9
00:00:22,840 --> 00:00:25,269
- Stop it. - This feels like ages ago.

10
00:00:25,270 --> 00:00:26,379
Stop it.

11
00:00:26,380 --> 00:00:27,485
Hello.

12
00:00:28,310 --> 00:00:29,578
(Hello!)

13
00:00:29,579 --> 00:00:31,084
Hello.

14
00:00:31,180 --> 00:00:33,078
- Hello. - It's from ancient times.

15
00:00:33,079 --> 00:00:34,348
- Hello. - Stop that.

16
00:00:34,349 --> 00:00:35,519
(The excitement still lingers on.)

17
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:37,418
It's from ancient times. "Ancient times".

18
00:00:37,419 --> 00:00:38,618
That feels like ages ago.

19
00:00:38,619 --> 00:00:39,859
- Hello. - My gosh.

20
00:00:39,860 --> 00:00:41,088
- Hi. - Hi.

21
00:00:41,089 --> 00:00:42,465
So Min,

22
00:00:42,689 --> 00:00:44,889
you're not in a good mood today, right?

23
00:00:44,890 --> 00:00:45,899
- No. - Really?

24
00:00:45,900 --> 00:00:47,899
- She seems different than usual. - No.

25
00:00:47,900 --> 00:00:49,069
- No, no. - You seem different than usual.

26
00:00:49,070 --> 00:00:50,798
Seok Jin couldn't get a wink of sleep last night...

27
00:00:50,799 --> 00:00:52,069
because of his first love.

28
00:00:52,070 --> 00:00:54,274
(You're the one who seems different than usual.)

29
00:00:54,939 --> 00:00:56,039
What are you talking about?

30
00:00:56,040 --> 00:00:57,908
That's what you told me as soon as you got here.

31
00:00:57,909 --> 00:00:59,209
What are you talking about?

32
00:00:59,210 --> 00:01:00,984
Hey, stop making stuff up.

33
00:01:01,009 --> 00:01:03,078
- I definitely heard it. - Stop making stuff up.

34
00:01:03,079 --> 00:01:04,249
- He's a viper. - That was so mean.

35
00:01:04,250 --> 00:01:05,408
Stop making stuff up.

36
00:01:05,409 --> 00:01:07,054
- He's a viper. - You said you were tired.

37
00:01:07,579 --> 00:01:08,995
No, that's not true.

38
00:01:09,290 --> 00:01:11,248
"I couldn't sleep because of my first love."

39
00:01:11,249 --> 00:01:13,459
No, no. I was looking at my yearbook.

40
00:01:13,460 --> 00:01:14,959
- Yearbook? - I was looking at my yearbook.

41
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:16,659
- When you were in school? - I thought about my teacher...

42
00:01:16,660 --> 00:01:18,659
- and my friends. - You thought about your friends.

43
00:01:18,660 --> 00:01:20,258
- What's your teacher's name? - Pardon?

44
00:01:20,259 --> 00:01:21,505
What's your teacher's name?

45
00:01:22,199 --> 00:01:23,399
Just take care of your teacher.

46
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:25,875
(Just take care of your teacher.)

47
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:27,539
"Your teacher"?

48
00:01:27,540 --> 00:01:29,184
- Why did you say it so rudely? - Why are you getting angry?

49
00:01:29,210 --> 00:01:30,608
- I mean... - Why were you so rude?

50
00:01:30,609 --> 00:01:31,884
- Show some respect. - Take care of your dear teacher.

51
00:01:32,270 --> 00:01:34,138
(He's speechless.)

52
00:01:34,139 --> 00:01:36,209
Ji Hyo, do join us after getting rid of the sleep in your eyes.

53
00:01:36,210 --> 00:01:37,909
(Ji Hyo is the easiest target.)

54
00:01:37,910 --> 00:01:39,978
(Why did he speak like that?)

55
00:01:39,979 --> 00:01:41,918
- You keep... - "Do join us"?

56
00:01:41,919 --> 00:01:43,349
(I get that you're flustered, but...)

57
00:01:43,350 --> 00:01:44,418
"Do join us."

58
00:01:44,419 --> 00:01:45,595
"Do start the filming."

59
00:01:46,290 --> 00:01:48,834
He talks as if he's giving out missions.

60
00:01:49,059 --> 00:01:50,858
He might say to his wife, "Do kiss me."

61
00:01:50,859 --> 00:01:53,005
(Do kiss me.)

62
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:55,035
"All right, my family. Do eat."

63
00:01:55,729 --> 00:01:58,269
- "Do fix me a meal." - "Everyone, do go to work."

64
00:01:58,270 --> 00:01:59,744
"All right. Do have..."

65
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:01,399
"a meal today."

66
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:02,399
(He's in a tight spot due to his mistake.)

67
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:03,539
That's a nice way of speaking.

68
00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:04,714
By the way,

69
00:02:05,270 --> 00:02:08,338
after the fan-meet, we were going to grab a meal together.

70
00:02:08,339 --> 00:02:11,149
- Seok Jin called everyone. - Right.

71
00:02:11,150 --> 00:02:12,448
- Ji Hyo, - A few of us did.

72
00:02:12,449 --> 00:02:14,079
- We went to a nice restaurant. - Se Chan and Haha couldn't come...

73
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:15,424
- because of work. - Right.

74
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:17,764
- The five of us had dinner. - That's right.

75
00:02:18,050 --> 00:02:20,359
- We had a nice meal thanks to him. - We had beef.

76
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:22,035
- Thank you for the meal. - It was a classy restaurant.

77
00:02:22,289 --> 00:02:23,688
- It was a classy restaurant. - It was a barbecue restaurant.

78
00:02:23,689 --> 00:02:25,535
At the end of our meal,

79
00:02:25,689 --> 00:02:28,058
- I thought the beef was so tasty. - Right. Yes, it was.

80
00:02:28,059 --> 00:02:30,098
So I suggested taking some of the beef home.

81
00:02:30,099 --> 00:02:32,269
- He suggested taking new sets. - Jong Kook lives alone and all.

82
00:02:32,270 --> 00:02:34,674
- Right. It was so nice. - I suggested buying a few sets.

83
00:02:34,700 --> 00:02:37,038
But someone was scowling at me.

84
00:02:37,039 --> 00:02:38,538
- I was really surprised. - Right? You saw him too.

85
00:02:38,539 --> 00:02:40,139
Seok Jin was scowling at me.

86
00:02:40,140 --> 00:02:41,239
Do stop!

87
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:43,785
(Do stop!)

88
00:02:43,980 --> 00:02:45,278
Do stop taking beef home.

89
00:02:45,279 --> 00:02:48,025
- I said I would buy the beef. - Right.

90
00:02:48,249 --> 00:02:49,389
He said, "Okay, then."

91
00:02:49,390 --> 00:02:52,095
(He agreed quickly.)

92
00:02:52,289 --> 00:02:53,495
"Okay, then."

93
00:02:53,719 --> 00:02:54,995
"Okay, then."

94
00:02:55,659 --> 00:02:57,688
So when we were saying goodbye, we said to Jae Seok,

95
00:02:57,689 --> 00:03:00,174
"Jae Seok, thank you for the food."

96
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:02,204
- "Thank you, Jae Seok." - But Seok Jin paid for the meal.

97
00:03:02,869 --> 00:03:03,968
We thanked him at the end.

98
00:03:03,969 --> 00:03:05,399
- That's the power of packed beef. - Seok Jin...

99
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:07,239
- Seok Jin bought us the meal. - Packed beef...

100
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:09,139
- He stole my thunder. - I stole his thunder.

101
00:03:09,140 --> 00:03:10,338
When I got home,

102
00:03:10,339 --> 00:03:12,315
I only felt grateful toward Jae Seok.

103
00:03:12,610 --> 00:03:14,438
- You should've paid for everything. - My goodness.

104
00:03:14,439 --> 00:03:15,739
- You're so sly. - Listen.

105
00:03:15,740 --> 00:03:18,049
- This is so funny. - No, he's warmhearted.

106
00:03:18,050 --> 00:03:19,649
Everyone thanked him for the food.

107
00:03:19,650 --> 00:03:21,419
And Seok Jin was holding the beef and said, "Jae Seok..."

108
00:03:21,420 --> 00:03:24,525
(And Seok Jin was holding the beef and said, "Jae Seok...")

109
00:03:25,119 --> 00:03:26,259
Come on, Seok Jin.

110
00:03:26,260 --> 00:03:27,818
Where is your pride?

111
00:03:27,819 --> 00:03:28,989
- Really? - You took some too?

112
00:03:28,990 --> 00:03:30,959
- You did? He bought you food. - Yes, I took some beef home too.

113
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:32,729
- "Jae Seok, thank you for this." - Right.

114
00:03:32,730 --> 00:03:34,028
He left after saying that.

115
00:03:34,029 --> 00:03:35,528
That's why it felt weird for us too.

116
00:03:35,529 --> 00:03:37,199
Why do you look so restless?

117
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:39,275
(Seok Jin bought the 1st round. And Jae Seok bought the 2nd round.)

118
00:03:39,469 --> 00:03:42,068
- The fan-meet is over now. - Yes.

119
00:03:42,069 --> 00:03:43,614
How do you feel?

120
00:03:44,510 --> 00:03:46,555
It's over now. My gosh.

121
00:03:46,909 --> 00:03:48,838
That day, I was in a daze.

122
00:03:48,839 --> 00:03:51,055
He told me that he felt so wronged...

123
00:03:51,150 --> 00:03:52,878
- because he couldn't cry that day. - I'm serious. That day...

124
00:03:52,879 --> 00:03:55,655
He told me that he wanted to cry just like Ji Hyo.

125
00:03:56,249 --> 00:03:58,324
I was right next to Seok Jin.

126
00:03:58,520 --> 00:04:00,664
As soon as Ji Hyo started to cry,

127
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:02,688
he said, "Okay, Ji Hyo took it."

128
00:04:02,689 --> 00:04:04,734
("Okay, Ji Hyo took it.")

129
00:04:05,890 --> 00:04:08,204
"Ji Hyo took everything."

130
00:04:08,499 --> 00:04:11,544
After hearing that, I got the chills.

131
00:04:12,869 --> 00:04:15,338
(After the group choreography, she was overwhelmed with emotions...)

132
00:04:15,339 --> 00:04:17,444
(and ended up genuinely crying.)

133
00:04:18,210 --> 00:04:19,509
(Seok Jin was watching this.)

134
00:04:19,510 --> 00:04:23,854
("Ji Hyo took it.")

135
00:04:24,349 --> 00:04:26,595
(He got the chills.)

136
00:04:27,580 --> 00:04:29,348
By the way, like we talked about earlier,

137
00:04:29,349 --> 00:04:31,718
- she was overwhelmed with emotions. - Right.

138
00:04:31,719 --> 00:04:32,788
- She's very sentimental. - Well, she is...

139
00:04:32,789 --> 00:04:34,619
Ji Hyo said this to me on stage.

140
00:04:34,620 --> 00:04:36,934
"Kwang Soo, what should I do? Help me out here."

141
00:04:37,029 --> 00:04:38,664
I said, "Think about how we'll drink later." And her face...

142
00:04:38,989 --> 00:04:40,528
(Smiling)

143
00:04:40,529 --> 00:04:42,075
- I'm serious. It only took seconds. - Really?

144
00:04:43,770 --> 00:04:46,244
(Kwang Soo, do something.)

145
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:50,445
(Think about how we'll drink later.)

146
00:04:52,239 --> 00:04:54,015
(Smiling brightly)

147
00:04:54,710 --> 00:04:57,209
(A team dinner makes even crying Ji Hyo smile.)

148
00:04:57,210 --> 00:04:59,379
Everyone, for about 100 days,

149
00:04:59,380 --> 00:05:02,395
you've been working so hard to prepare for the fan-meet.

150
00:05:02,719 --> 00:05:04,449
(We had to work really hard, but it was rewarding.)

151
00:05:04,450 --> 00:05:06,889
To reward your hard work,

152
00:05:06,890 --> 00:05:08,319
we've prepared a relaxing vacation.

153
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:10,934
It's You're All That Matters: Vacation Race.

154
00:05:11,729 --> 00:05:13,275
- This is a bonus episode. - A vacation?

155
00:05:13,929 --> 00:05:16,228
We've prepared a lot of various activities for the vacation.

156
00:05:16,229 --> 00:05:17,604
Please bring in the board.

157
00:05:17,630 --> 00:05:20,399
(All that matters is that you like it. Vacation Keywords)

158
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:21,775
- "Joo Jin Mo"? - What's "Date with Joo Jin Mo"?

159
00:05:21,799 --> 00:05:23,715
Joo Jin Mo will be on our show?

160
00:05:23,770 --> 00:05:25,608
- "Date with the Stars". - "Date with the Stars".

161
00:05:25,609 --> 00:05:26,838
I want to go on a date with stars.

162
00:05:26,839 --> 00:05:28,684
- "Concert". - Please!

163
00:05:29,080 --> 00:05:30,278
- Another one? - All right.

164
00:05:30,279 --> 00:05:32,048
Among these eight activities,

165
00:05:32,049 --> 00:05:34,178
you will draw three activities and enjoy them.

166
00:05:34,179 --> 00:05:35,649
(All that matters is that you like it. Vacation Keywords)

167
00:05:35,650 --> 00:05:38,689
You will each choose one activity.

168
00:05:38,690 --> 00:05:40,288
And the members who chose the selected activity...

169
00:05:40,289 --> 00:05:41,819
will become the hosts of the activity.

170
00:05:41,820 --> 00:05:44,004
The members will be in charge of the selected activity.

171
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:46,358
- Is that so? - The hosts do whatever they want.

172
00:05:46,359 --> 00:05:48,259
On the next board, you can see the possible outcomes.

173
00:05:48,260 --> 00:05:49,829
At the end of each activity,

174
00:05:49,830 --> 00:05:51,668
seven members excluding the host...

175
00:05:51,669 --> 00:05:54,269
will vote between "satisfied" or "dissatisfied".

176
00:05:54,270 --> 00:05:56,238
- My goodness. - We have to satisfy the members.

177
00:05:56,239 --> 00:05:57,369
Will that be possible?

178
00:05:57,370 --> 00:05:59,168
- My gosh, that's hard. - It's hard to satisfy everyone.

179
00:05:59,169 --> 00:06:01,439
"If everyone is dissatisfied, the host..."

180
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:03,778
"and the member of the host's choice will get two penalty badges."

181
00:06:03,779 --> 00:06:07,149
It will be advantageous for you to choose an activity...

182
00:06:07,150 --> 00:06:09,319
that will satisfy the members the most.

183
00:06:09,320 --> 00:06:12,788
At the end of your vacation, the member with the most badges...

184
00:06:12,789 --> 00:06:14,858
will draw an activity among remaining activities...

185
00:06:14,859 --> 00:06:17,959
and carry it out alone instead of going home as a penalty.

186
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:19,528
- Alone? - Yes.

187
00:06:19,529 --> 00:06:20,734
- Alone? - We can't even choose someone?

188
00:06:20,859 --> 00:06:22,205
I already chose one.

189
00:06:22,900 --> 00:06:24,999
Hold on. Why don't we each choose an activity?

190
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,598
- I... - Who wants to go for the third one?

191
00:06:26,599 --> 00:06:28,145
- Me. I want "Lovely Jam". - Let's play rock-paper-scissors.

192
00:06:28,169 --> 00:06:29,709
- Me too. - "Lovely Jam".

193
00:06:29,710 --> 00:06:30,769
Rock-paper-scissors

194
00:06:30,770 --> 00:06:32,238
(Suddenly joining)

195
00:06:32,239 --> 00:06:33,379
- Okay. - Okay. I won too.

196
00:06:33,380 --> 00:06:34,838
- Why did you join at the end? - I won too.

197
00:06:34,839 --> 00:06:36,009
Rock-paper-scissors

198
00:06:36,010 --> 00:06:37,178
(All of a sudden, Jae Seok participates too.)

199
00:06:37,179 --> 00:06:38,885
- Why did you join at the end? - I won too.

200
00:06:38,950 --> 00:06:41,079
- He did play with us. - I won too.

201
00:06:41,080 --> 00:06:43,525
- Rock-paper-scissors - Rock-paper-scissors

202
00:06:43,719 --> 00:06:45,119
(Seok Jin wins.)

203
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:47,195
- Okay. I got "Lovely Jam". - What about the fourth one?

204
00:06:47,620 --> 00:06:49,135
I'll go for "Date with Joo Jin Mo".

205
00:06:49,219 --> 00:06:50,228
You can try out twice?

206
00:06:50,229 --> 00:06:52,734
I get the feeling that Joo Jin Mo won't be joining us.

207
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,428
- Is it Lim Chin Mo? - You know?

208
00:06:54,429 --> 00:06:56,769
Well, if it's a date with him...

209
00:06:56,770 --> 00:06:58,968
But there are two celebrities with the name, Joo Jin Mo.

210
00:06:58,969 --> 00:07:00,838
- The young actor? - There's the young actor.

211
00:07:00,839 --> 00:07:04,439
- And Jjakgwi is Joo Jin Mo too. - Right. That's his name too.

212
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:06,639
- Stop promoting the movie. - No, I'm not promoting it.

213
00:07:06,640 --> 00:07:07,984
(Why bring up Jjakgwi here?)

214
00:07:08,010 --> 00:07:10,385
No, I'm not promoting it. I'm not doing that.

215
00:07:10,450 --> 00:07:12,684
- No. No, I'm not. - You're not promoting it?

216
00:07:12,820 --> 00:07:14,379
Good luck, "Cheer up, Mr. Lee".

217
00:07:14,380 --> 00:07:15,494
What?

218
00:07:16,489 --> 00:07:17,649
It'd be great if both movies are successful.

219
00:07:17,650 --> 00:07:19,048
- Yes, it'd be great. - Exactly.

220
00:07:19,049 --> 00:07:21,364
- You met Cha Seung Won, right? - That's right.

221
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:22,965
It'd be great if both movies are successful.

222
00:07:23,330 --> 00:07:25,358
- That'd be great for everyone. - Right.

223
00:07:25,359 --> 00:07:27,629
- Jae Seok will be the host then. - Am I the only one?

224
00:07:27,630 --> 00:07:29,259
- I'll go for it too. - Okay.

225
00:07:29,260 --> 00:07:30,504
- Me too. - Rock...

226
00:07:31,029 --> 00:07:32,499
You don't even know what it is.

227
00:07:32,500 --> 00:07:33,975
You don't even know what it is.

228
00:07:34,539 --> 00:07:35,699
Why are you here?

229
00:07:35,700 --> 00:07:36,809
I'm sorry.

230
00:07:36,810 --> 00:07:38,738
(The group choreography has become a part of his life.)

231
00:07:38,739 --> 00:07:40,885
- Rock-paper-scissors - Rock-paper-scissors

232
00:07:41,339 --> 00:07:43,085
(Kwang Soo is out.)

233
00:07:43,849 --> 00:07:45,124
Okay!

234
00:07:45,250 --> 00:07:46,754
He got the date with Joo Jin Mo.

235
00:07:46,779 --> 00:07:47,879
"Tag" is mine.

236
00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:49,178
(Jae Seok tries out for "Tag".)

237
00:07:49,179 --> 00:07:50,424
I'll go for "Snowfields".

238
00:07:50,549 --> 00:07:51,588
- "Snowfields"? - Yes.

239
00:07:51,589 --> 00:07:52,689
I'll go for that too.

240
00:07:52,690 --> 00:07:53,794
What?

241
00:07:53,989 --> 00:07:55,619
- Why are you changing your mind? - Let's do this.

242
00:07:55,620 --> 00:07:57,164
- Why... - "Snowfields".

243
00:07:57,330 --> 00:07:58,759
- You said... - "Snowfields".

244
00:07:58,760 --> 00:08:00,874
- He's a fighter. - Rock-paper-scissors

245
00:08:00,900 --> 00:08:02,135
Okay. Go back to your spot.

246
00:08:02,900 --> 00:08:04,399
Rock-paper-scissors. Okay. Go back to your spot.

247
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:05,798
(Sighing)

248
00:08:05,799 --> 00:08:07,238
(What is wrong with this guy?)

249
00:08:07,239 --> 00:08:08,414
It's mine.

250
00:08:09,640 --> 00:08:10,809
(Vacation Keywords)

251
00:08:10,810 --> 00:08:13,009
Ji Hyo got "Tag", and Se Chan got "Date with the Stars".

252
00:08:13,010 --> 00:08:15,314
Poor you, Se Chan. You need to invite a celebrity.

253
00:08:15,409 --> 00:08:17,608
You know a lot of celebrities. Your brother is one too.

254
00:08:17,609 --> 00:08:19,819
- Se Hyeong is like a small fry. - A small fry?

255
00:08:19,820 --> 00:08:21,624
(Se Hyeong is like a small fry.)

256
00:08:22,479 --> 00:08:23,718
He's a small fry.

257
00:08:23,719 --> 00:08:25,149
- He's acceptable though. - Okay.

258
00:08:25,150 --> 00:08:28,564
I'll explain each vacation activity.

259
00:08:28,589 --> 00:08:30,304
As for the board game,

260
00:08:30,659 --> 00:08:32,428
you can enjoy this activity regardless of the weather...

261
00:08:32,429 --> 00:08:34,158
by using your strong lower body and agility.

262
00:08:34,159 --> 00:08:36,905
- It's an indoor surfing activity. - I knew it.

263
00:08:37,630 --> 00:08:38,928
- It's a board game with surfing. - Surfing?

264
00:08:38,929 --> 00:08:40,938
And as for the second vacation activity, "Date with Joo Jin Mo"...

265
00:08:40,939 --> 00:08:41,999
- I'm curious about that. - What's that?

266
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,509
At the "zoo",

267
00:08:43,510 --> 00:08:44,938
you'll enjoy your vacation while communicating...

268
00:08:44,939 --> 00:08:46,379
with the animals like their "real mothers".

269
00:08:46,380 --> 00:08:47,884
- What? - Real animals?

270
00:08:48,679 --> 00:08:50,109
What kind of animals are they?

271
00:08:50,110 --> 00:08:52,849
I find small animals cute, but I'm scared of big animals.

272
00:08:52,850 --> 00:08:55,078
Gosh, it'd be hard to satisfy us with that activity.

273
00:08:55,079 --> 00:08:56,288
Gosh, I don't think I could do it.

274
00:08:56,289 --> 00:08:57,524
(He's already scared.)

275
00:08:58,350 --> 00:09:00,034
- He's scared of animals. - What is it?

276
00:09:00,319 --> 00:09:02,065
- I don't think I can. - Or we can...

277
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:05,288
- What about "Lovely Jam"? - As for "Lovely Jam"...

278
00:09:05,289 --> 00:09:06,435
- What is it? - What's that?

279
00:09:06,559 --> 00:09:09,028
You'll harvest lovely peanuts from a peanut field...

280
00:09:09,029 --> 00:09:11,298
and make jam out of the harvested peanuts.

281
00:09:11,299 --> 00:09:13,144
- That sounds hard. - We can experience the process.

282
00:09:13,199 --> 00:09:14,545
- We're going to make peanut butter. - Right. It could be hard.

283
00:09:14,569 --> 00:09:16,038
As for the fourth one, "Abundant Meal",

284
00:09:16,039 --> 00:09:18,139
- This one is Jong Kook. - This may be a bit unfamiliar.

285
00:09:18,140 --> 00:09:20,479
This has twice the protein than beef.

286
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:22,455
And this is very nutritious and healthy.

287
00:09:22,539 --> 00:09:24,908
You must eat cookies and pizza made of insects.

288
00:09:24,909 --> 00:09:27,818
(You must eat cookies and pizza made of insects.)

289
00:09:27,819 --> 00:09:29,918
(The edible insects are abundant in protein, nutrition, and minerals.)

290
00:09:29,919 --> 00:09:31,119
We're going to eat that?

291
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:32,688
(This is the best activity for these exhausted members.)

292
00:09:32,689 --> 00:09:34,364
Ji Hyo won't like it at all.

293
00:09:34,419 --> 00:09:35,734
This is the worst.

294
00:09:36,020 --> 00:09:37,458
(Are you sure this is a vacation?)

295
00:09:37,459 --> 00:09:39,288
- We're going to eat that? - I like grasshoppers...

296
00:09:39,289 --> 00:09:40,705
- Or crickets. - and I eat a lot of them.

297
00:09:40,829 --> 00:09:42,374
As for the "Concert",

298
00:09:42,529 --> 00:09:45,028
you will harvest corn from a field...

299
00:09:45,029 --> 00:09:47,198
and put them on the tray.

300
00:09:47,199 --> 00:09:48,538
This one is the best.

301
00:09:48,539 --> 00:09:49,808
You can harvest corns.

302
00:09:49,809 --> 00:09:50,869
- This is good. - Corns?

303
00:09:50,870 --> 00:09:53,278
- The sixth one is "Snowfields". - That's mine.

304
00:09:53,279 --> 00:09:54,555
As for the snowfields,

305
00:09:54,610 --> 00:09:55,908
you'll collect salt in a salt pond.

306
00:09:55,909 --> 00:09:58,225
(Collect salt in a salt pond.)

307
00:09:59,110 --> 00:10:01,494
- My gosh, this is really hard. - Let's not choose that one.

308
00:10:01,750 --> 00:10:03,994
(It's the worst of the worst.)

309
00:10:05,049 --> 00:10:06,435
Let's not do that one. Salt pond...

310
00:10:06,789 --> 00:10:07,818
Salt pond?

311
00:10:07,819 --> 00:10:10,158
(They can collect salt while walking on the snowfields.)

312
00:10:10,159 --> 00:10:12,134
- Salt pond? - Seriously?

313
00:10:12,289 --> 00:10:14,229
We'll get there at night.

314
00:10:14,230 --> 00:10:16,028
- But... - If this is selected,

315
00:10:16,029 --> 00:10:17,698
you must try your best to satisfy the members.

316
00:10:17,699 --> 00:10:19,369
- When will we get there? - Exactly.

317
00:10:19,370 --> 00:10:21,575
- As for the seventh activity, - Okay.

318
00:10:21,970 --> 00:10:24,369
you will go on a date with lobsters at an indoor fishing site.

319
00:10:24,370 --> 00:10:25,808
- I see. - This is...

320
00:10:25,809 --> 00:10:27,778
- Lucky him. - This one is nice.

321
00:10:27,779 --> 00:10:29,408
- The seventh sounds pretty good. - I've gone to one...

322
00:10:29,409 --> 00:10:31,448
- a long time ago. - I should've picked that one.

323
00:10:31,449 --> 00:10:32,784
Going there was a penalty.

324
00:10:32,809 --> 00:10:33,918
Why did I choose the snowfields?

325
00:10:33,919 --> 00:10:35,894
- This is the last activity, "Tag". - Okay.

326
00:10:36,020 --> 00:10:37,864
The best game of tags is Freeze Tag.

327
00:10:38,150 --> 00:10:41,219
You'll carry frozen food in a cold storage at minus 20℃.

328
00:10:41,220 --> 00:10:43,158
- Gosh. - You'll be able to experience that.

329
00:10:43,159 --> 00:10:44,158
Who will be it?

330
00:10:44,159 --> 00:10:47,058
- How could we satisfy anyone? - How can we rest?

331
00:10:47,059 --> 00:10:50,028
If you work me like this, I might collapse.

332
00:10:50,029 --> 00:10:51,068
(Listen to me.)

333
00:10:51,069 --> 00:10:52,969
Don't you know how hard I work these days?

334
00:10:52,970 --> 00:10:55,675
- He's right. - I'm supposed to work here too?

335
00:10:55,840 --> 00:10:58,708
- Jae Seok's always working. - My goodness.

336
00:10:58,709 --> 00:11:00,808
I'm working everywhere these days.

337
00:11:00,809 --> 00:11:02,538
How many jobs does he have?

338
00:11:02,539 --> 00:11:04,208
- Hey. - He's a worker.

339
00:11:04,209 --> 00:11:06,548
Take shows that are easy to do.

340
00:11:06,549 --> 00:11:08,379
(He gives Jae Seok advice.)

341
00:11:08,380 --> 00:11:09,619
Easy shows?

342
00:11:09,620 --> 00:11:11,288
- Pick those shows. - The ones filmed at studios?

343
00:11:11,289 --> 00:11:12,719
- Just chat in the studios. - Hey.

344
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:14,394
You won't be able to buy tenderloin at that rate.

345
00:11:15,520 --> 00:11:17,089
What do you mean?

346
00:11:17,090 --> 00:11:18,528
(He should work hard and buy meat once again.)

347
00:11:18,529 --> 00:11:21,205
We'll pick the first place.

348
00:11:21,230 --> 00:11:23,369
- "Lovely Jam" is the best. - Then...

349
00:11:23,370 --> 00:11:25,028
- Right. - The "Snowfields" one is the worst.

350
00:11:25,029 --> 00:11:26,739
- Pick "Lovely Jam". - Pick number five.

351
00:11:26,740 --> 00:11:27,899
- Pick the lobster one. - Let's fish.

352
00:11:27,900 --> 00:11:29,708
- Let's fish. - That's good.

353
00:11:29,709 --> 00:11:31,469
- That would be great. - That one's nice too.

354
00:11:31,470 --> 00:11:34,009
- I'd love that. - I've never fished lobsters before.

355
00:11:34,010 --> 00:11:35,354
(Se Chan wishes for "Date with the Stars".)

356
00:11:35,510 --> 00:11:37,509
- What is that? - Pick one.

357
00:11:37,510 --> 00:11:38,778
(He picks one.)

358
00:11:38,779 --> 00:11:39,918
What is that?

359
00:11:39,919 --> 00:11:42,795
(Which one will be their 1st vacation activity?)

360
00:11:43,620 --> 00:11:44,849
"Lovely Jam".

361
00:11:44,850 --> 00:11:46,565
(He picks "Lovely Jam".)

362
00:11:47,419 --> 00:11:48,489
That's not bad.

363
00:11:48,490 --> 00:11:49,634
Gosh.

364
00:11:49,689 --> 00:11:52,288
- But it feels like... - We'll be making jam.

365
00:11:52,289 --> 00:11:56,099
Seok Jin will be the host of "Lovely Jam".

366
00:11:56,100 --> 00:11:57,599
- Let us go. - I hope you will be able...

367
00:11:57,600 --> 00:11:59,198
to satisfy the members.

368
00:11:59,199 --> 00:12:00,969
I'm worried about that.

369
00:12:00,970 --> 00:12:03,215
He's not generous enough to be a host.

370
00:12:03,970 --> 00:12:05,269
I'm serious.

371
00:12:05,270 --> 00:12:07,854
Look at how he acted back at the barbecue restaurant.

372
00:12:08,039 --> 00:12:10,249
- At the barbecue restaurant? - I will make you all happy.

373
00:12:10,250 --> 00:12:11,678
- All right, let's go. - I'm serious.

374
00:12:11,679 --> 00:12:14,119
You're not the generous type. I mean it.

375
00:12:14,120 --> 00:12:15,948
- I'll... - He's just warmhearted.

376
00:12:15,949 --> 00:12:17,649
- If you have sore legs, - He's not generous.

377
00:12:17,650 --> 00:12:19,089
- I can carry you. - Really?

378
00:12:19,090 --> 00:12:21,188
- Yes. I can carry one of you. - My back hurts.

379
00:12:21,189 --> 00:12:22,864
- Carry me. - I can do it.

380
00:12:23,020 --> 00:12:24,889
- I'm the lightest. - Darn it.

381
00:12:24,890 --> 00:12:26,364
(He shares his innermost feelings.)

382
00:12:26,390 --> 00:12:28,604
- Did you say, "Darn it"? - No, I didn't.

383
00:12:28,900 --> 00:12:30,698
All right, let's go.

384
00:12:30,699 --> 00:12:32,469
Let's get going now.

385
00:12:32,470 --> 00:12:34,075
Are you taking me to the car?

386
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:36,168
I'm fine as long as you're content.

387
00:12:36,169 --> 00:12:37,609
Okay. Thank you.

388
00:12:37,610 --> 00:12:39,408
Hold on.

389
00:12:39,409 --> 00:12:40,654
Thank you.

390
00:12:41,309 --> 00:12:42,538
Please carry me from here.

391
00:12:42,539 --> 00:12:44,024
- Seok Jin. - He wants you to carry him again.

392
00:12:44,110 --> 00:12:46,085
- Hey! - You need to satisfy us.

393
00:12:46,179 --> 00:12:47,519
I'm here!

394
00:12:47,520 --> 00:12:50,124
- You need to satisfy him. - Please do.

395
00:12:51,289 --> 00:12:52,288
(To keep Jae Seok happy, he carries him once again.)

396
00:12:52,289 --> 00:12:53,658
You said you'd carry him.

397
00:12:53,659 --> 00:12:55,359
Right, he did say that.

398
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:58,058
Why are your legs so thick?

399
00:12:58,059 --> 00:13:00,528
- He's in for some trouble today. - Thank you.

400
00:13:00,529 --> 00:13:02,229
- Here. - Thank you.

401
00:13:02,230 --> 00:13:03,999
- That's enough. - Thank you.

402
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,869
(He makes sure his customer stays satisfied...)

403
00:13:05,870 --> 00:13:07,339
(by blocking the entrance.)

404
00:13:07,340 --> 00:13:09,215
- All right. - He'll be struggling today.

405
00:13:09,939 --> 00:13:11,568
(They depart for the peanut fields.)

406
00:13:11,569 --> 00:13:13,479
I love eating bread with peanut butter.

407
00:13:13,480 --> 00:13:15,239
- Me too. - You also need...

408
00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:16,948
- to apply jam. - And milk too.

409
00:13:16,949 --> 00:13:17,979
- And strawberry jam. - You'll get thirsty.

410
00:13:17,980 --> 00:13:20,379
As the host of "Sweet Jam"...

411
00:13:20,380 --> 00:13:21,479
- It's "Lovely Jam". - It's "Lovely Jam".

412
00:13:21,480 --> 00:13:23,989
(It's "Lovely Jam"!)

413
00:13:23,990 --> 00:13:25,665
- Right. - It's "Lovely Jam".

414
00:13:25,919 --> 00:13:27,119
What is this?

415
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:29,958
As the host of "Lovely Jam"...

416
00:13:29,959 --> 00:13:32,288
Did you get it confused with that game?

417
00:13:32,289 --> 00:13:34,904
That's a game I used to play when I was little.

418
00:13:35,100 --> 00:13:36,729
I wasn't talking about that.

419
00:13:36,730 --> 00:13:38,428
- You're so boring! - What?

420
00:13:38,429 --> 00:13:39,969
- He's so boring! - He's extremely boring!

421
00:13:39,970 --> 00:13:41,869
- He's extremely boring! - I knew it!

422
00:13:41,870 --> 00:13:44,239
Anyway, I used to play that game when I was little.

423
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:45,639
- Goodness. - Anyway...

424
00:13:45,640 --> 00:13:47,109
- He's so calm. - He is.

425
00:13:47,110 --> 00:13:48,908
As long as you're satisfied...

426
00:13:48,909 --> 00:13:50,754
- You're terrible. - What?

427
00:13:50,909 --> 00:13:52,048
(You're terrible.)

428
00:13:52,049 --> 00:13:53,185
You're terrible.

429
00:13:53,819 --> 00:13:55,654
- He's terrible. - Are you talking about jeans?

430
00:13:55,750 --> 00:13:58,089
- Right. - Right.

431
00:13:58,090 --> 00:13:59,818
I see. You startled me.

432
00:13:59,819 --> 00:14:01,019
- I have a question. - Okay.

433
00:14:01,020 --> 00:14:02,989
- Do you... - Wait, let me go first.

434
00:14:02,990 --> 00:14:05,188
(Jae Seok suddenly cuts Kwang Soo off.)

435
00:14:05,189 --> 00:14:07,004
- Do you... - Why did you cut me off?

436
00:14:07,529 --> 00:14:09,028
I was talking, you know?

437
00:14:09,029 --> 00:14:10,774
- Look here. - You cut me off.

438
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,899
- Goodness. - It's okay for you to argue.

439
00:14:12,900 --> 00:14:14,739
But you should listen to my introduction to this activity.

440
00:14:14,740 --> 00:14:16,739
Then give me three dollars.

441
00:14:16,740 --> 00:14:18,839
I'll wire you three dollars later.

442
00:14:18,840 --> 00:14:20,038
- Really? - Yes.

443
00:14:20,039 --> 00:14:21,339
I'll send it through ARS.

444
00:14:21,340 --> 00:14:23,139
- ARS? - Is that right?

445
00:14:23,140 --> 00:14:24,524
I'd like 30 dollars then.

446
00:14:24,610 --> 00:14:26,649
- 30 dollars? - Yes, 30 dollars.

447
00:14:26,650 --> 00:14:27,948
- Why 30 dollars? - Why?

448
00:14:27,949 --> 00:14:29,178
I just want 30 dollars.

449
00:14:29,179 --> 00:14:31,719
- All right, I'll wire it to you. - That's enough.

450
00:14:31,720 --> 00:14:33,048
- To my account? - Yes.

451
00:14:33,049 --> 00:14:35,418
- Make sure you give it to me. - Give me your account number.

452
00:14:35,419 --> 00:14:37,658
- All right. - He won't give it right now.

453
00:14:37,659 --> 00:14:39,864
- It's too far. - The service is awful.

454
00:14:39,959 --> 00:14:41,298
Well...

455
00:14:41,299 --> 00:14:45,099
- He said the service was awful. - That was funny.

456
00:14:45,100 --> 00:14:46,975
You're the awful one.

457
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:49,068
- He is. - Anyway,

458
00:14:49,069 --> 00:14:51,068
I've been doing this...

459
00:14:51,069 --> 00:14:53,168
- for 26 years now. - Really?

460
00:14:53,169 --> 00:14:54,609
I've never had such lovely guests before.

461
00:14:54,610 --> 00:14:56,239
- Did you start in your 50s? - What?

462
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:58,509
(Did you start in your 50s?)

463
00:14:58,510 --> 00:15:00,119
(He was a celebrity until he was 54.)

464
00:15:00,120 --> 00:15:02,624
- All right. - How old is he?

465
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:04,149
- How old is he? - Okay.

466
00:15:04,150 --> 00:15:05,719
- In four years... - He retired.

467
00:15:05,720 --> 00:15:07,089
I'll turn 80 in 4 years.

468
00:15:07,090 --> 00:15:08,918
I'll turn 80 in 4 years.

469
00:15:08,919 --> 00:15:11,989
I'm your host for today's "Sweet Jam".

470
00:15:11,990 --> 00:15:14,034
- It's "Lovely Jam". - Right.

471
00:15:15,559 --> 00:15:18,428
- Wait. Are you married? - Yes?

472
00:15:18,429 --> 00:15:20,915
- Not yet. - Not yet?

473
00:15:21,270 --> 00:15:23,315
(You're 76 years old.)

474
00:15:23,640 --> 00:15:25,839
- What do you mean? - Why are you lying?

475
00:15:25,840 --> 00:15:26,979
Why are you lying?

476
00:15:26,980 --> 00:15:28,984
- What's wrong with you? - How could you lie?

477
00:15:29,010 --> 00:15:31,009
- I haven't gotten married yet. - Goodness.

478
00:15:31,010 --> 00:15:33,325
- It'll be Chuseok in three days. - You're right.

479
00:15:33,350 --> 00:15:35,225
Please come cook some pancakes for our family.

480
00:15:36,049 --> 00:15:38,448
- Promise him right now. - Promise him.

481
00:15:38,449 --> 00:15:41,318
- Please cook for me too. - Please answer us.

482
00:15:41,319 --> 00:15:42,894
- He's being battered. - Hold on.

483
00:15:42,959 --> 00:15:44,089
Hold on.

484
00:15:44,090 --> 00:15:45,788
I'm not cut out to be a host.

485
00:15:45,789 --> 00:15:47,104
It's rising inside of me.

486
00:15:47,329 --> 00:15:49,335
So what will you do?

487
00:15:49,860 --> 00:15:51,244
Gosh.

488
00:15:51,470 --> 00:15:53,339
- My happiness is rising. - Your happiness?

489
00:15:53,340 --> 00:15:56,938
- After listening to you guys, - Watch what you say.

490
00:15:56,939 --> 00:15:59,369
I'm becoming happier.

491
00:15:59,370 --> 00:16:01,009
I want to do more for you.

492
00:16:01,010 --> 00:16:02,339
- That's good. - That's how I feel.

493
00:16:02,340 --> 00:16:04,879
- It's best not to become the host. - Exactly.

494
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:06,178
It's slavery.

495
00:16:06,179 --> 00:16:07,354
(He's tattered.)

496
00:16:08,279 --> 00:16:09,425
This is it.

497
00:16:09,449 --> 00:16:10,719
We're here.

498
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:12,889
It's a great day to pick the peanuts.

499
00:16:12,890 --> 00:16:15,389
You have arrived at your first vacation activity.

500
00:16:15,390 --> 00:16:17,958
- Let me explain the hidden rule. - There's a hidden rule?

501
00:16:17,959 --> 00:16:20,958
Every activity has a hidden mission.

502
00:16:20,959 --> 00:16:23,928
(Every activity has a hidden mission.)

503
00:16:23,929 --> 00:16:27,644
The mission will be delivered to everyone except the host.

504
00:16:28,199 --> 00:16:29,239
There are missions.

505
00:16:29,240 --> 00:16:31,538
Until the end of each activity, you'll acquire one more vote...

506
00:16:31,539 --> 00:16:34,178
if you succeed in the missions.

507
00:16:34,179 --> 00:16:35,339
(They'll receive one more vote if they pass the hidden missions.)

508
00:16:35,340 --> 00:16:38,609
However, if the host finds out what the hidden missions are,

509
00:16:38,610 --> 00:16:42,394
your extra votes will be void.

510
00:16:43,079 --> 00:16:44,688
The host needs to...

511
00:16:44,689 --> 00:16:45,749
- He can't guess it. - I will get it.

512
00:16:45,750 --> 00:16:47,359
- He shouldn't find out. - No.

513
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:49,288
- Our votes will disappear. - There's no need to be nice.

514
00:16:49,289 --> 00:16:51,264
(He doesn't need to act nicely.)

515
00:16:52,590 --> 00:16:54,198
- I just need to find it out. - No.

516
00:16:54,199 --> 00:16:55,658
- Okay, bring it on. - All right.

517
00:16:55,659 --> 00:16:57,528
- Bring it on. - I was in agony for 30 minutes.

518
00:16:57,529 --> 00:16:59,168
Only the additional votes will be void.

519
00:16:59,169 --> 00:17:01,198
- Right. - We'll still have the originals.

520
00:17:01,199 --> 00:17:02,999
- I won't forget what you just said. - It's 1 versus 7.

521
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,815
I'll wire you the 30 dollars.

522
00:17:05,240 --> 00:17:07,484
- I'll give it to you. - It's 90 dollars now.

523
00:17:08,309 --> 00:17:09,408
- It increased threefold. - Goodness.

524
00:17:09,409 --> 00:17:11,609
- It increased threefold. - It skyrocketed immediately.

525
00:17:11,610 --> 00:17:14,718
Thirty dollars is difficult since I sell jam to make ends meet.

526
00:17:14,719 --> 00:17:17,349
Will the host leave the car?

527
00:17:17,350 --> 00:17:19,018
Okay. Just me?

528
00:17:19,019 --> 00:17:21,494
Seok Jin's leaving? How sad.

529
00:17:22,120 --> 00:17:23,195
Goodness.

530
00:17:23,459 --> 00:17:25,859
- That's so sad. - Let him leave.

531
00:17:25,860 --> 00:17:27,529
Good work thus far.

532
00:17:27,530 --> 00:17:29,399
- Good work. - Good job.

533
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:30,399
- Goodbye. - Bye.

534
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:31,428
Go home safely.

535
00:17:31,429 --> 00:17:33,175
- I'll be leaving alone. - Okay.

536
00:17:33,330 --> 00:17:35,074
All right.

537
00:17:35,239 --> 00:17:36,339
Bye.

538
00:17:36,340 --> 00:17:38,084
- He looks so pitiful. - This is sad.

539
00:17:38,269 --> 00:17:40,408
(The host leaves the car.)

540
00:17:40,409 --> 00:17:42,508
It's so hot. This isn't good.

541
00:17:42,509 --> 00:17:44,524
Your first hidden mission...

542
00:17:44,550 --> 00:17:46,355
is stealing the host's belongings.

543
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:49,018
- This is easy. - This is hard.

544
00:17:49,019 --> 00:17:51,018
- He doesn't have many. - No, he doesn't.

545
00:17:51,019 --> 00:17:54,589
They could be items he used such as water bottles or sacks.

546
00:17:54,590 --> 00:17:55,794
Anything works.

547
00:17:55,820 --> 00:17:58,029
- It'll be obvious if we all do it. - We need to do something.

548
00:17:58,030 --> 00:17:59,228
We need to distract him.

549
00:17:59,229 --> 00:18:00,629
Hey.

550
00:18:00,630 --> 00:18:01,928
(Kwang Soo picks up Seok Jin's water bottle.)

551
00:18:01,929 --> 00:18:03,928
- Not yet. We haven't begun. - Hey.

552
00:18:03,929 --> 00:18:05,099
My gosh.

553
00:18:05,100 --> 00:18:07,339
- He unbuckled his belt. - Why are you drinking that?

554
00:18:07,340 --> 00:18:08,738
That's So Min's now.

555
00:18:08,739 --> 00:18:09,799
- We need to distract him midway. - Right.

556
00:18:09,800 --> 00:18:12,369
It'll be difficult to take anything that he's carrying.

557
00:18:12,370 --> 00:18:15,178
Let's confuse him by pretending like there are two missions.

558
00:18:15,179 --> 00:18:17,248
Or Jong Kook could knock him out...

559
00:18:17,249 --> 00:18:18,754
and strip him naked.

560
00:18:19,709 --> 00:18:21,418
- That's the easiest way. - Hey.

561
00:18:21,419 --> 00:18:22,748
- How could you say that? - We can take his pants off.

562
00:18:22,749 --> 00:18:25,119
I think he has seven different items on him right now.

563
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:26,264
Shall we get out?

564
00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:27,695
Let's go.

565
00:18:27,989 --> 00:18:29,395
This way!

566
00:18:30,130 --> 00:18:31,258
It's scorching hot.

567
00:18:31,259 --> 00:18:32,258
(It's very hot out.)

568
00:18:32,259 --> 00:18:33,698
It's going to be hot.

569
00:18:33,699 --> 00:18:35,129
This feels ominous.

570
00:18:35,130 --> 00:18:37,668
The ground is muddy too. Seriously.

571
00:18:37,669 --> 00:18:38,768
It's the worst.

572
00:18:38,769 --> 00:18:40,369
- It's scorching hot. - My gosh.

573
00:18:40,370 --> 00:18:41,399
The ground is steaming.

574
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:42,599
Everyone.

575
00:18:42,600 --> 00:18:44,268
It's so muddy. My gosh.

576
00:18:44,269 --> 00:18:45,369
(It rained the day before.)

577
00:18:45,370 --> 00:18:46,744
I'm wearing white shoes.

578
00:18:46,979 --> 00:18:48,678
This isn't good.

579
00:18:48,679 --> 00:18:50,014
- I didn't wear sunscreen. - This way.

580
00:18:50,209 --> 00:18:51,649
My goodness.

581
00:18:51,650 --> 00:18:55,178
This is "Lovely Jam", your first vacation activity.

582
00:18:55,179 --> 00:18:56,988
During this activity,

583
00:18:56,989 --> 00:18:59,448
you'll be picking peanuts and making peanut butter.

584
00:18:59,449 --> 00:19:02,018
You need to pick 5kg each.

585
00:19:02,019 --> 00:19:04,004
- That's a lot. - It is.

586
00:19:04,189 --> 00:19:06,658
The activity will end once you fulfill your quota.

587
00:19:06,659 --> 00:19:09,958
The host and the member the host will pick...

588
00:19:09,959 --> 00:19:11,829
will make peanut butter and share it with the group.

589
00:19:11,830 --> 00:19:13,468
- Okay. - Shall we go?

590
00:19:13,469 --> 00:19:15,274
- Let's go. - Is this supposed to be fun?

591
00:19:15,769 --> 00:19:17,314
Over here.

592
00:19:18,070 --> 00:19:20,254
Please come this way.

593
00:19:20,580 --> 00:19:22,685
(Mumbling)

594
00:19:22,739 --> 00:19:25,408
- We shouldn't get caught. - You're right.

595
00:19:25,409 --> 00:19:26,478
We'll be secretive.

596
00:19:26,479 --> 00:19:28,218
- We should be secretive. - We can't get caught.

597
00:19:28,219 --> 00:19:29,455
No, we can't.

598
00:19:29,850 --> 00:19:32,349
What are you doing?

599
00:19:32,350 --> 00:19:33,695
Nothing.

601
00:19:37,929 --> 00:19:39,064
Let's go.

602
00:19:39,989 --> 00:19:41,799
(Everyone is keeping Seok Jin in check.)

603
00:19:41,800 --> 00:19:43,458
- What? - Why did you touch my name tag?

604
00:19:43,459 --> 00:19:44,829
Your face will get burned.

605
00:19:44,830 --> 00:19:46,029
(It's time.)

606
00:19:46,030 --> 00:19:48,774
What's the mission? Why are you touching me?

607
00:19:49,269 --> 00:19:51,369
Kwang Soo.

608
00:19:51,370 --> 00:19:53,369
Yes? What is it?

609
00:19:53,370 --> 00:19:55,784
- Come here. - I left my hat in the car.

610
00:19:56,239 --> 00:19:57,885
I'll get it for you.

611
00:19:58,110 --> 00:19:59,779
(Don't do this to me.)

612
00:19:59,780 --> 00:20:00,955
I need my hat.

613
00:20:02,519 --> 00:20:04,718
- Don't touch me. - Something's poking out.

614
00:20:04,719 --> 00:20:05,988
(They head to the peanut fields.)

615
00:20:05,989 --> 00:20:07,889
I've never been to a peanut field before.

616
00:20:07,890 --> 00:20:10,334
(These two make a U-turn.)

617
00:20:10,659 --> 00:20:13,264
(They refuse to give up.)

618
00:20:15,229 --> 00:20:17,268
(They each steal a shoe insole.)

619
00:20:17,269 --> 00:20:19,399
(They succeed.)

620
00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:22,314
(Once the staff approves, they will gain a vote each.)

621
00:20:23,300 --> 00:20:25,238
I'm already getting irritated.

622
00:20:25,239 --> 00:20:27,139
- I'm already feeling dissatisfied. - Gosh.

623
00:20:27,140 --> 00:20:28,309
Take your gloves.

624
00:20:28,310 --> 00:20:29,609
- Listen up. - Those who are dissatisfied,

625
00:20:29,610 --> 00:20:30,879
- take your gloves. - I know...

626
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:34,018
it'll be tough, but harvesting can make you happy.

627
00:20:34,019 --> 00:20:36,549
I'm flabbergasted by this idea of yours.

628
00:20:36,550 --> 00:20:38,188
You can feel happy while harvesting.

629
00:20:38,189 --> 00:20:41,034
I'm so dumbfounded.

630
00:20:41,419 --> 00:20:44,264
(Director, take the insole for me.)

631
00:20:45,060 --> 00:20:46,458
- Lowering my pants? - What?

632
00:20:46,459 --> 00:20:47,998
- It's nothing. - Hold on.

633
00:20:47,999 --> 00:20:49,205
What's that?

634
00:20:49,630 --> 00:20:51,268
- Hold on. - What's that?

635
00:20:51,269 --> 00:20:53,099
- What is it? - Is there a restroom?

636
00:20:53,100 --> 00:20:54,869
Jae Seok, don't make it look obvious.

637
00:20:54,870 --> 00:20:56,099
What's wrong, Jae Seok?

638
00:20:56,100 --> 00:20:58,109
- I want to go to the restroom. - What now?

639
00:20:58,110 --> 00:21:00,208
Why is your butt sticking out?

640
00:21:00,209 --> 00:21:01,379
(Are you kidding me?)

641
00:21:01,380 --> 00:21:03,748
- It's just my mic. - Come and get your garden hoe.

642
00:21:03,749 --> 00:21:05,084
- Shall we? - Over here.

643
00:21:05,179 --> 00:21:07,279
Seok Jin, you're supposed to host this activity.

644
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:08,978
Tell us what we should do.

645
00:21:08,979 --> 00:21:11,289
Come on, Seok Jin. You're supposed to take the lead.

646
00:21:11,290 --> 00:21:13,895
Do better. Get it? Do better.

647
00:21:14,560 --> 00:21:15,635
Here.

648
00:21:15,659 --> 00:21:17,705
- Unbelievable. - It fell off.

649
00:21:17,759 --> 00:21:19,359
It fell off.

650
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:21,175
(He manages to deliver the shoe insole.)

651
00:21:21,560 --> 00:21:23,905
You're all acting weird. Let's go then.

652
00:21:24,499 --> 00:21:26,928
- Do we just dig them out? - Yes, just dig them out.

653
00:21:26,929 --> 00:21:28,668
Can you show us first?

654
00:21:28,669 --> 00:21:30,814
- Sure, let me show you. - Great.

655
00:21:31,040 --> 00:21:32,208
All of these are peanuts.

656
00:21:32,209 --> 00:21:33,615
- Right. - Over here!

657
00:21:33,739 --> 00:21:35,238
The owner is over there.

658
00:21:35,239 --> 00:21:36,379
- Right. - Over here.

659
00:21:36,380 --> 00:21:37,678
It's the owner of the field.

660
00:21:37,679 --> 00:21:39,678
So this is how you harvest peanuts.

661
00:21:39,679 --> 00:21:41,254
(Perfect timing)

662
00:21:41,479 --> 00:21:42,579
Right.

663
00:21:42,580 --> 00:21:44,248
Dig with a garden hoe...

664
00:21:44,249 --> 00:21:45,619
on each side.

665
00:21:45,620 --> 00:21:46,688
Here it comes!

666
00:21:46,689 --> 00:21:47,859
Like this.

667
00:21:47,860 --> 00:21:49,658
- Look at the peanuts. - Check these out.

668
00:21:49,659 --> 00:21:50,734
These are peanuts.

669
00:21:50,989 --> 00:21:53,258
Then, you pluck each of them off.

670
00:21:53,259 --> 00:21:54,829
- Got it. - That's done by hand.

671
00:21:54,830 --> 00:21:55,928
Okay!

672
00:21:55,929 --> 00:21:58,074
("Countryside Diary" with Seok Jin and the kids)

673
00:21:59,030 --> 00:22:01,668
- My gosh. - Let me help.

674
00:22:01,669 --> 00:22:02,744
Right.

675
00:22:02,999 --> 00:22:04,369
Why are you helping me though?

676
00:22:04,370 --> 00:22:05,569
Take another.

677
00:22:05,570 --> 00:22:07,139
Why are you suddenly helping me?

678
00:22:07,140 --> 00:22:08,978
These need to be picked off by hand.

679
00:22:08,979 --> 00:22:10,279
Why trouble yourself with frivolous tasks?

680
00:22:10,280 --> 00:22:12,849
My gosh, look at how big these are.

681
00:22:12,850 --> 00:22:15,054
You're right. They're huge.

682
00:22:15,679 --> 00:22:18,389
One would at least have 500g of peanuts.

683
00:22:18,390 --> 00:22:20,758
We'll pick 5kg in no time.

684
00:22:20,759 --> 00:22:23,389
I feel bad picking off ones that are too small.

685
00:22:23,390 --> 00:22:24,988
I know, right?

686
00:22:24,989 --> 00:22:26,289
You must even pick the small ones.

687
00:22:26,290 --> 00:22:27,435
(Says the owner)

688
00:22:27,560 --> 00:22:29,458
- Really? - Even the tiny ones?

689
00:22:29,459 --> 00:22:31,198
- That's right. - Even ones like Haha?

690
00:22:31,199 --> 00:22:32,299
- Of course. - Yes.

691
00:22:32,300 --> 00:22:34,738
Even Haha is a valuable member of society.

692
00:22:34,739 --> 00:22:36,039
This one is like Haha.

693
00:22:36,040 --> 00:22:37,208
Do we throw it away?

694
00:22:37,209 --> 00:22:39,109
- This is Haha. - It's adorable.

695
00:22:39,110 --> 00:22:41,408
- Haha, look. - I mean it in a different way,

696
00:22:41,409 --> 00:22:42,885
but this is how Jae Seok is.

697
00:22:43,679 --> 00:22:45,355
(That's weirdly upsetting.)

698
00:22:45,650 --> 00:22:47,119
(Confessions are thrown while at the peanut field.)

699
00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:49,018
My dream guy from now on is a peanut.

700
00:22:49,019 --> 00:22:50,988
- Why? - They're adorable.

701
00:22:50,989 --> 00:22:52,718
- Your dream guy? - That'll change.

702
00:22:52,719 --> 00:22:54,064
In what way?

703
00:22:54,189 --> 00:22:56,165
- What? - Stop giving it a meaning!

704
00:22:56,590 --> 00:22:57,829
Just keep harvesting.

705
00:22:57,830 --> 00:23:00,458
- I'm just short, right? - I can't believe So Min.

706
00:23:00,459 --> 00:23:02,658
You might think that they're just small,

707
00:23:02,659 --> 00:23:05,129
but they come in bundles.

708
00:23:05,130 --> 00:23:09,299
So Min, do you want me to set you up with someone?

709
00:23:09,300 --> 00:23:11,615
- Who? - I've been eyeing someone.

710
00:23:11,769 --> 00:23:13,938
- So Min's quite charming, you know. - She does.

711
00:23:13,939 --> 00:23:16,254
- Fools. - Of course, she's charming.

712
00:23:16,610 --> 00:23:18,109
"Fools"?

713
00:23:18,110 --> 00:23:20,649
She keeps growing on you.

714
00:23:20,650 --> 00:23:22,718
- That's right. - Jong Kook didn't know at first.

715
00:23:22,719 --> 00:23:24,389
(Jong Kook didn't know at first.)

716
00:23:24,390 --> 00:23:25,725
He didn't.

717
00:23:26,019 --> 00:23:28,165
I just thought she was a weirdo.

718
00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:31,488
Jong Kook would deliberately avoid So Min.

719
00:23:31,489 --> 00:23:34,258
(They now know how charming she is.)

720
00:23:34,259 --> 00:23:35,559
You guys...

721
00:23:35,560 --> 00:23:36,859
I've gotten the hang of it now.

722
00:23:36,860 --> 00:23:40,029
Guys, after you harvest it, shake off the dirt.

723
00:23:40,030 --> 00:23:41,675
(Shaking)

724
00:23:41,870 --> 00:23:43,844
You're getting dirt everywhere!

725
00:23:44,310 --> 00:23:47,109
Also, can you stop talking and work harder?

726
00:23:47,110 --> 00:23:48,478
I always work hard.

727
00:23:48,479 --> 00:23:51,178
We're busy as it is, so why must we work more?

728
00:23:51,179 --> 00:23:52,725
You know,

729
00:23:53,449 --> 00:23:55,978
I'm doing too much labor on TV shows lately.

730
00:23:55,979 --> 00:23:57,549
Isn't this a show on tvN?

731
00:23:57,550 --> 00:23:58,625
No.

732
00:23:59,120 --> 00:24:01,258
I'm doing too much manual labor lately.

733
00:24:01,259 --> 00:24:02,688
The joy of harvest.

734
00:24:02,689 --> 00:24:04,264
(The joy of harvest)

735
00:24:04,560 --> 00:24:07,359
This is the season of harvesting.

736
00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:09,099
We don't have time for that. Keep plucking!

737
00:24:09,100 --> 00:24:11,399
- Hurry up. - Go to tvN instead then.

738
00:24:11,400 --> 00:24:12,599
- What? - Why do that here?

739
00:24:12,600 --> 00:24:15,399
- What do you mean, "Go to tvN"? - My gosh.

740
00:24:15,400 --> 00:24:18,185
- Hey. - Was that really necessary?

741
00:24:18,209 --> 00:24:20,084
You're on a tvN show too though.

742
00:24:20,310 --> 00:24:21,708
But I don't mention it here.

743
00:24:21,709 --> 00:24:24,079
Must you be that way when we're paid by the same person?

744
00:24:24,080 --> 00:24:26,279
If you want, I'll pick them for you.

745
00:24:26,280 --> 00:24:27,448
Here!

746
00:24:27,449 --> 00:24:29,079
Can you help me too?

747
00:24:29,080 --> 00:24:31,425
- With what? - My son's tooth.

748
00:24:31,989 --> 00:24:32,988
Your son's tooth?

749
00:24:32,989 --> 00:24:35,289
Yes, his baby teeth have been falling out.

750
00:24:35,290 --> 00:24:37,018
- Well... - Seok Jin!

751
00:24:37,019 --> 00:24:38,764
- Yes? - Can you dig me out?

752
00:24:39,090 --> 00:24:40,774
(What?)

753
00:24:41,360 --> 00:24:43,198
(He's burying himself.)

754
00:24:43,199 --> 00:24:44,369
Dig me out.

755
00:24:44,370 --> 00:24:45,768
When did you get in there?

756
00:24:45,769 --> 00:24:47,198
I was planted.

757
00:24:47,199 --> 00:24:48,869
- How? - It happened...

758
00:24:48,870 --> 00:24:50,175
while harvesting the peanuts.

759
00:24:50,509 --> 00:24:52,869
- That's kind of you. - You're good at that.

760
00:24:52,870 --> 00:24:54,178
- I can pluck out anything. - Seok Jin?

761
00:24:54,179 --> 00:24:56,655
Can you help my son get elected as class president?

762
00:24:57,179 --> 00:24:58,455
My gosh.

763
00:24:59,179 --> 00:25:00,524
Not everything is possible.

764
00:25:00,679 --> 00:25:01,824
Seok Jin.

765
00:25:02,380 --> 00:25:03,579
- Seok Jin. - Yes?

766
00:25:03,580 --> 00:25:04,789
Wear this.

767
00:25:04,790 --> 00:25:06,488
Why are you looking out for me?

768
00:25:06,489 --> 00:25:08,564
- This isn't like you. - Everyone will get one.

769
00:25:08,759 --> 00:25:10,359
- Here. - I don't want it.

770
00:25:10,360 --> 00:25:11,889
I'll take it then!

771
00:25:11,890 --> 00:25:13,105
(He's trying to ruin Kwang Soo's plan.)

772
00:25:13,259 --> 00:25:14,975
- Why you? - Give it to me!

773
00:25:15,100 --> 00:25:17,299
Seok Jin, why won't you take it?

774
00:25:17,300 --> 00:25:18,945
Kwang Soo, go ahead.

775
00:25:19,669 --> 00:25:21,175
That's not how you wear it.

776
00:25:21,300 --> 00:25:22,839
It's the other way around.

777
00:25:22,840 --> 00:25:24,369
(Kwang Soo isn't a fool.)

778
00:25:24,370 --> 00:25:25,508
Is this it?

779
00:25:25,509 --> 00:25:27,084
It's nice!

780
00:25:27,479 --> 00:25:28,655
Isn't it comfortable?

781
00:25:28,709 --> 00:25:29,708
It's what I harvested.

782
00:25:29,709 --> 00:25:31,279
Can someone wipe my eyes?

783
00:25:31,280 --> 00:25:32,279
- Why? - Who wants to join me?

784
00:25:32,280 --> 00:25:34,079
This much is only 1.5kg.

785
00:25:34,080 --> 00:25:35,379
- 1.5kg. - Really?

786
00:25:35,380 --> 00:25:37,248
5kg is more than I initially thought.

787
00:25:37,249 --> 00:25:39,289
- This isn't an easy task. - Tell me about it.

788
00:25:39,290 --> 00:25:41,494
This is exhausting.

789
00:25:42,019 --> 00:25:44,688
- How can you say that? - How can the host say that?

790
00:25:44,689 --> 00:25:45,865
I...

791
00:25:45,890 --> 00:25:47,258
Give me 90 dollars!

792
00:25:47,259 --> 00:25:48,299
(What is this?)

793
00:25:48,300 --> 00:25:49,799
- I want ice cream. - I want coffee.

794
00:25:49,800 --> 00:25:51,029
Get us coffee and ice cream.

795
00:25:51,030 --> 00:25:53,129
- I'd like shaved ice. - It's hot out here.

796
00:25:53,130 --> 00:25:54,599
You can get some if you win first place.

797
00:25:54,600 --> 00:25:55,599
- First place? - Yes.

798
00:25:55,600 --> 00:25:58,385
Must we compete even on a vacation?

799
00:25:58,769 --> 00:25:59,809
(He quickly accepts the complaint.)

800
00:25:59,810 --> 00:26:01,014
I take it back then.

801
00:26:01,509 --> 00:26:03,008
(Seok Jin is pitiful.)

802
00:26:03,009 --> 00:26:05,248
Shouldn't you go to make the peanut butter?

803
00:26:05,249 --> 00:26:06,279
That I should.

804
00:26:06,280 --> 00:26:08,119
- You need a partner. - Choose a partner.

805
00:26:08,120 --> 00:26:09,849
Who wants to come with me?

806
00:26:09,850 --> 00:26:10,988
- Me. - Me.

807
00:26:10,989 --> 00:26:12,089
Me!

808
00:26:12,090 --> 00:26:13,688
I'll take whoever promises...

809
00:26:13,689 --> 00:26:16,789
- to be satisfied. - How can we not be?

810
00:26:16,790 --> 00:26:18,488
If you don't say you're satisfied,

811
00:26:18,489 --> 00:26:20,264
your future projects will never do well.

812
00:26:20,390 --> 00:26:22,559
- Must you say that? - That's fine with me,

813
00:26:22,560 --> 00:26:23,998
so choose me.

814
00:26:23,999 --> 00:26:26,029
Do you promise to be satisfied with my tour?

815
00:26:26,030 --> 00:26:27,198
- Yes, I will. - Unbelievable.

816
00:26:27,199 --> 00:26:29,344
- Over here. - Okay, I choose So Min.

817
00:26:29,570 --> 00:26:31,569
- You promised to be satisfied. - Of course!

818
00:26:31,570 --> 00:26:32,569
- You're going too? - Yes.

819
00:26:32,570 --> 00:26:33,984
Is it good to go?

820
00:26:34,409 --> 00:26:36,655
Of course. It means you're off harvesting duty.

821
00:26:36,739 --> 00:26:38,524
But this...

822
00:26:39,280 --> 00:26:40,925
You're making us work instead?

823
00:26:41,080 --> 00:26:42,649
No matter how I think about it...

824
00:26:42,650 --> 00:26:44,389
- I'm unsatisfied. - How can he do this?

825
00:26:44,390 --> 00:26:45,918
I'm unsatisfied too.

826
00:26:45,919 --> 00:26:47,889
- Everybody! - When will we get our ice cream?

827
00:26:47,890 --> 00:26:49,488
I'll bring your ice cream soon.

828
00:26:49,489 --> 00:26:51,029
Calling this an experience is a joke.

829
00:26:51,030 --> 00:26:52,359
- Exactly. - Where can I buy ice cream?

830
00:26:52,360 --> 00:26:55,799
Will you settle with one satisfied person?

831
00:26:55,800 --> 00:26:57,029
Let's just throw a fit.

832
00:26:57,030 --> 00:26:58,998
Okay, hold on. I'll get you your ice cream.

833
00:26:58,999 --> 00:27:01,099
- I will. - Bring it to us now.

834
00:27:01,100 --> 00:27:02,799
- I... - This isn't 5kg.

835
00:27:02,800 --> 00:27:04,369
Who hasn't worked here before, right?

836
00:27:04,370 --> 00:27:05,668
Forget about it.

837
00:27:05,669 --> 00:27:06,809
Whatever!

838
00:27:06,810 --> 00:27:08,879
(Forget about it. Whatever!)

839
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:11,109
- "Whatever"? - Forget it!

840
00:27:11,110 --> 00:27:13,379
Be unsatisfied if you want.

841
00:27:13,380 --> 00:27:15,054
(Seok Jin explodes.)

842
00:27:15,850 --> 00:27:17,448
- Okay. - Do whatever you want.

843
00:27:17,449 --> 00:27:19,649
- What's wrong with him? - I'm annoyed too.

844
00:27:19,650 --> 00:27:21,119
- I can't take this anymore. - What is this?

845
00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:22,889
Be unsatisfied and see if I care.

846
00:27:22,890 --> 00:27:23,988
What's wrong with him?

847
00:27:23,989 --> 00:27:25,988
Do as you please!

848
00:27:25,989 --> 00:27:28,498
- Mister! - Mister?

849
00:27:28,499 --> 00:27:29,599
(What?)

850
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:31,099
What did you just call me?

851
00:27:31,100 --> 00:27:32,928
- Are you insane? - Do as you please.

852
00:27:32,929 --> 00:27:34,268
- What's with Mr. Big Nose? - Whatever.

853
00:27:34,269 --> 00:27:36,268
(The Strife of Big Nose)

854
00:27:36,269 --> 00:27:38,609
- What's with Mr. Big Nose? - Let's go and make peanut butter.

855
00:27:38,610 --> 00:27:40,639
Let's go. At least So Min will be satisfied.

856
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:42,185
- Of course. - Why didn't you throw it at me?

857
00:27:42,810 --> 00:27:44,084
He's pretending to not have seen you.

858
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:47,955
You didn't say anything when it really mattered though.

859
00:27:48,019 --> 00:27:50,155
He was able to hold his anger towards you.

860
00:27:50,449 --> 00:27:52,619
(They check the weight again after the commotion.)

861
00:27:52,620 --> 00:27:53,789
I've reached 5kg.

862
00:27:53,790 --> 00:27:55,564
- What are you doing? - Seriously?

863
00:27:55,620 --> 00:27:57,728
I can't believe you pressed down the scale.

864
00:27:57,729 --> 00:27:59,688
- Gosh. - We'll switch it to 3kg.

865
00:27:59,689 --> 00:28:00,774
Good.

866
00:28:01,929 --> 00:28:04,804
I think that we have a peanut thief.

867
00:28:05,030 --> 00:28:07,145
I had a lot in my sack,

868
00:28:07,870 --> 00:28:09,938
but it's been cut down to half. Who took mine?

869
00:28:09,939 --> 00:28:11,508
(Wanted: Peanut Thief)

870
00:28:11,509 --> 00:28:14,155
The truth will come out once we see the video.

871
00:28:14,409 --> 00:28:15,554
Who was it?

872
00:28:16,810 --> 00:28:19,079
(Rewinding tape)

873
00:28:19,080 --> 00:28:21,324
(Mr. Yu seems suspicious.)

874
00:28:22,179 --> 00:28:24,625
(In the commotion, he steals the peanuts.)

875
00:28:24,850 --> 00:28:27,324
(A fistful)

876
00:28:28,189 --> 00:28:29,435
Who was it?

877
00:28:29,459 --> 00:28:31,089
Figure it out yourself.

878
00:28:31,090 --> 00:28:32,258
It was you!

879
00:28:32,259 --> 00:28:33,258
(Busted!)

880
00:28:33,259 --> 00:28:35,375
(He's embarrassed.)

881
00:28:35,929 --> 00:28:38,099
- No way. - Gosh.

882
00:28:38,100 --> 00:28:39,198
Why would I steal them?

883
00:28:39,199 --> 00:28:40,799
Are you the peanut thief?

884
00:28:40,800 --> 00:28:41,839
Look.

885
00:28:41,840 --> 00:28:43,498
It's true that peanuts can identify peanuts.

886
00:28:43,499 --> 00:28:45,084
All right, everyone!

887
00:28:45,509 --> 00:28:47,208
- Mister. - We'll collect...

888
00:28:47,209 --> 00:28:50,155
- what you harvested and... - We're in the middle of a sketch.

889
00:28:50,380 --> 00:28:51,579
- Please butt out. - Hey.

890
00:28:51,580 --> 00:28:53,809
Go and make the peanut butter already.

891
00:28:53,810 --> 00:28:55,178
(Why you...)

892
00:28:55,179 --> 00:28:56,754
Sir, let's go.

893
00:28:56,820 --> 00:28:57,988
- Promise? - Yes.

894
00:28:57,989 --> 00:28:59,365
So Min, good luck on the hidden mission.

895
00:28:59,449 --> 00:29:00,764
We'll go and make the peanut butter.

896
00:29:02,659 --> 00:29:04,829
Kwang Soo, can you help him take this off?

897
00:29:04,830 --> 00:29:06,734
(It's time to steal the host's belonging.)

898
00:29:06,890 --> 00:29:08,498
No, let me.

899
00:29:08,499 --> 00:29:09,859
(It's an opportunity!)

900
00:29:09,860 --> 00:29:12,744
(They run over for an easy score.)

901
00:29:13,900 --> 00:29:16,415
Is it your mission to help me?

902
00:29:16,669 --> 00:29:18,369
(Crowded)

903
00:29:18,370 --> 00:29:20,645
He's not as tactless as he used to be.

904
00:29:21,739 --> 00:29:23,185
Let's go then.

905
00:29:23,880 --> 00:29:26,824
(Haha stole Seok Jin's small name tag.)

906
00:29:28,380 --> 00:29:31,188
(He discreetly hands it in.)

907
00:29:31,189 --> 00:29:34,264
(Haha and Se Chan have won a vote too.)

908
00:29:34,290 --> 00:29:35,688
Look at these peanuts.

909
00:29:35,689 --> 00:29:37,988
(This is a chance to steal another one.)

910
00:29:37,989 --> 00:29:39,359
(It's mine!)

911
00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:41,198
What are you guys doing?

912
00:29:41,199 --> 00:29:42,559
- Who helped him? - Okay, I got it.

913
00:29:42,560 --> 00:29:44,599
- I did. - I helped him too.

914
00:29:44,600 --> 00:29:46,768
- So you're supposed to help me. - Just one.

915
00:29:46,769 --> 00:29:49,468
Helping me is your hidden mission.

916
00:29:49,469 --> 00:29:50,468
You should leave the peanuts.

917
00:29:50,469 --> 00:29:53,039
That's one hilarious mission, right?

918
00:29:53,040 --> 00:29:55,678
How does that even make any sense?

919
00:29:55,679 --> 00:29:56,678
I think we should make him believe it.

920
00:29:56,679 --> 00:29:58,279
Hold on...

921
00:29:58,280 --> 00:29:59,908
Thank you for choosing me.

922
00:29:59,909 --> 00:30:01,855
Oh, right. Gosh, it's hot.

923
00:30:02,019 --> 00:30:03,079
(White bread and crackers go well with jam.)

924
00:30:03,080 --> 00:30:05,365
There's bread. No way.

925
00:30:05,650 --> 00:30:06,965
I see sweet potatoes too.

926
00:30:07,590 --> 00:30:09,064
Thank you.

927
00:30:09,090 --> 00:30:11,889
They must grow sweet potatoes here as well. This is nice.

928
00:30:11,890 --> 00:30:13,629
The field we saw earlier was a sweet potatoes field.

929
00:30:13,630 --> 00:30:15,498
- The one we saw first? - Yes.

930
00:30:15,499 --> 00:30:17,299
- The flat one. - It's warm.

931
00:30:17,300 --> 00:30:19,844
- Have you not seen this done? - Of course.

932
00:30:20,100 --> 00:30:21,814
Look how I'm doing it.

933
00:30:21,999 --> 00:30:22,998
(Picking one up)

934
00:30:22,999 --> 00:30:24,445
Don't eat that.

935
00:30:24,840 --> 00:30:25,839
(Don't just sit there and eat.)

936
00:30:25,840 --> 00:30:26,908
It's fascinating.

937
00:30:26,909 --> 00:30:28,508
(Roast the peanuts in a frying pan.)

938
00:30:28,509 --> 00:30:30,279
- We need to roast them. - Place them in a blender...

939
00:30:30,280 --> 00:30:32,478
- with salt. - And add olive oil.

940
00:30:32,479 --> 00:30:34,178
- Honey is needed too. - That's it?

941
00:30:34,179 --> 00:30:36,294
- Is it this simple? - That's how you make peanut butter.

942
00:30:36,919 --> 00:30:39,195
(She mixes it well to look like she's helping him.)

943
00:30:39,620 --> 00:30:42,488
(How does it taste?)

944
00:30:42,489 --> 00:30:43,665
How does it taste?

945
00:30:43,919 --> 00:30:46,165
- It tastes good. - It's very easy to make.

946
00:30:46,659 --> 00:30:49,099
It tastes really good. It tastes just like peanut butter.

947
00:30:49,100 --> 00:30:50,129
It tastes the same.

948
00:30:50,130 --> 00:30:51,728
(So Min is pretending to help Seok Jin.)

949
00:30:51,729 --> 00:30:52,945
Jae Seok has so much.

950
00:30:53,469 --> 00:30:55,039
Guys, work hard.

951
00:30:55,040 --> 00:30:56,899
- I think we should hurry up. - 3kg...

952
00:30:56,900 --> 00:30:58,344
(It's like they're shooting "Field Experience of Life".)

953
00:30:58,640 --> 00:31:00,069
I'm only halfway through now.

954
00:31:00,070 --> 00:31:01,855
(They're working hard to dig up 3kg of peanuts.)

955
00:31:02,679 --> 00:31:04,655
(Jae Seok approaches the staff.)

956
00:31:05,310 --> 00:31:06,455
Can I buy some of that?

957
00:31:06,880 --> 00:31:09,155
(It's a 5kg sample bag of peanuts.)

958
00:31:09,479 --> 00:31:10,549
Can't I?

959
00:31:10,550 --> 00:31:11,819
What are you doing here?

960
00:31:11,820 --> 00:31:13,718
- What are you doing? - He stole my peanuts for real.

961
00:31:13,719 --> 00:31:15,165
Let's play rock-paper-scissors for peanuts.

962
00:31:15,820 --> 00:31:16,965
Okay?

963
00:31:17,560 --> 00:31:18,665
Let's do this.

964
00:31:19,229 --> 00:31:21,359
We'll each bet some of our peanuts.

965
00:31:21,360 --> 00:31:22,728
- If you win, you get as much. - Okay.

966
00:31:22,729 --> 00:31:23,899
- You make an investment. - Get as much as you invested.

967
00:31:23,900 --> 00:31:25,244
- I have 1.5kg now. - Okay.

968
00:31:26,100 --> 00:31:27,715
- I'll bet all I have. - All in?

969
00:31:28,400 --> 00:31:30,069
(The ants)

970
00:31:30,070 --> 00:31:31,339
I think this will be faster.

971
00:31:31,340 --> 00:31:33,584
(The grasshoppers)

972
00:31:33,610 --> 00:31:35,208
Hey, stop!

973
00:31:35,209 --> 00:31:36,554
You're like One Eyed Jack.

974
00:31:36,979 --> 00:31:38,754
Thanks. Hey.

975
00:31:40,249 --> 00:31:41,794
You're so reckless.

976
00:31:42,580 --> 00:31:43,955
Are you betting your life on this?

977
00:31:44,719 --> 00:31:46,195
- I'm going all-in. - Rock-paper-scissors.

978
00:31:46,890 --> 00:31:48,458
Rock-paper-scissors

979
00:31:48,459 --> 00:31:49,794
(Kwang Soo goes all-in.)

980
00:31:50,290 --> 00:31:52,158
(Kwang Soo wins.)

981
00:31:52,159 --> 00:31:54,475
Okay!

982
00:31:54,659 --> 00:31:56,728
Shouldn't Kwang Soo play Lee Kwang Soo Game?

983
00:31:56,729 --> 00:31:59,168
(Shouldn't Kwang Soo play Lee Kwang Soo Game?)

984
00:31:59,169 --> 00:32:00,268
He's right.

985
00:32:00,269 --> 00:32:02,438
Play, "Jjam or ppong? 1, 2, 3."

986
00:32:02,439 --> 00:32:04,039
- It's Kwang Soo. - Right.

987
00:32:04,040 --> 00:32:05,668
Rock-paper-scissors is no fun.

988
00:32:05,669 --> 00:32:07,339
- He has no sense of responsibility. - Exactly.

989
00:32:07,340 --> 00:32:08,584
- Gosh. - Seriously.

990
00:32:08,610 --> 00:32:10,685
Shall we play Lee Kwang Soo Game then?

991
00:32:11,050 --> 00:32:12,225
What's wrong with you?

992
00:32:12,780 --> 00:32:13,978
Do you have no sense of ownership?

993
00:32:13,979 --> 00:32:15,554
- I'll go first. - You?

994
00:32:16,050 --> 00:32:17,718
- I'm betting all I have. - You're betting 1.5kg.

995
00:32:17,719 --> 00:32:19,094
Somebody told me...

996
00:32:20,050 --> 00:32:21,294
to bet my life.

997
00:32:21,419 --> 00:32:22,764
- Haha. - Who?

998
00:32:22,860 --> 00:32:24,094
One Eyed Jack.

999
00:32:24,929 --> 00:32:27,064
(You're the best.)

1000
00:32:28,159 --> 00:32:29,359
- Here we go. - Here we go.

1001
00:32:29,360 --> 00:32:31,774
You only get one shot at life. I go all-in.

1002
00:32:31,929 --> 00:32:36,274
Then it's either "shot" or "life."

1003
00:32:36,600 --> 00:32:38,708
- Okay. - "Shot" or "life".

1004
00:32:38,709 --> 00:32:39,738
1, 2, 3.

1005
00:32:39,739 --> 00:32:41,355
- Life! - Life!

1006
00:32:41,380 --> 00:32:42,639
Nice!

1007
00:32:42,640 --> 00:32:44,625
(Haha loses all he has.)

1008
00:32:46,249 --> 00:32:47,895
Why did you bet your life on that?

1009
00:32:48,679 --> 00:32:49,879
(There's another person who is betting his life.)

1010
00:32:49,880 --> 00:32:51,049
You fool.

1011
00:32:51,050 --> 00:32:52,264
Do "Tazza".

1012
00:32:52,350 --> 00:32:54,165
- Let's do "Tazza". - "Tazza".

1013
00:32:54,590 --> 00:32:55,994
It's "ta" or "zza".

1014
00:32:56,060 --> 00:32:57,294
1, 2, 3.

1015
00:32:58,659 --> 00:32:59,859
- Zza. - Zza.

1016
00:32:59,860 --> 00:33:02,004
(They both say "zza".)

1017
00:33:02,360 --> 00:33:05,129
(Both One Eyed Jack and his promoter lose all they have.)

1018
00:33:05,130 --> 00:33:06,168
Jae Seok.

1019
00:33:06,169 --> 00:33:08,599
Don't do it. The energy over there is not good.

1020
00:33:08,600 --> 00:33:10,715
(Okay, I'll listen to you.)

1021
00:33:11,070 --> 00:33:12,945
- The energy is not good. - I'll just dig up some more.

1022
00:33:13,840 --> 00:33:15,014
That'd be better.

1023
00:33:15,310 --> 00:33:17,215
- One last try. - You want to try again?

1024
00:33:17,280 --> 00:33:19,349
- Will you get a penalty badge? - Yes.

1025
00:33:19,350 --> 00:33:21,554
- A penalty badge? - If you lose.

1026
00:33:21,650 --> 00:33:24,225
If Haha loses this time,

1027
00:33:24,249 --> 00:33:26,289
- he'll get a penalty badge. - Okay.

1028
00:33:26,290 --> 00:33:27,649
What's with him?

1029
00:33:27,650 --> 00:33:28,895
Somebody told me to bet my life.

1030
00:33:28,919 --> 00:33:30,089
It's either "pea" or "nut".

1031
00:33:30,090 --> 00:33:31,359
- "Pea" or "nut"? - Yes.

1032
00:33:31,360 --> 00:33:33,165
- I'll say "nut". - Okay.

1033
00:33:33,189 --> 00:33:34,799
"Pea" or "nut". 1, 2, 3.

1034
00:33:34,800 --> 00:33:36,734
- Pea! - Nut!

1035
00:33:36,800 --> 00:33:37,899
- Okay! - You win.

1036
00:33:37,900 --> 00:33:38,975
(Haha is back where he started.)

1037
00:33:39,669 --> 00:33:40,844
Kwang Soo, do you want to try too?

1038
00:33:41,600 --> 00:33:43,899
(His gambler instinct comes into play.)

1039
00:33:43,900 --> 00:33:45,615
Kwang Soo, you should sweat for it.

1040
00:33:45,969 --> 00:33:47,369
I've already come too far.

1041
00:33:47,370 --> 00:33:48,715
Just be penalized.

1042
00:33:48,939 --> 00:33:50,754
- What? - Just...

1043
00:33:50,939 --> 00:33:52,324
Just be penalized.

1044
00:33:52,479 --> 00:33:53,584
You punk!

1045
00:33:53,709 --> 00:33:55,625
I'll pick you no matter what.

1046
00:33:56,080 --> 00:33:57,279
Let's do "magpie".

1047
00:33:57,280 --> 00:33:59,418
It's "mag" or "pie".

1048
00:33:59,419 --> 00:34:01,294
(This is my last chance.)

1049
00:34:01,689 --> 00:34:02,794
Go.

1050
00:34:03,860 --> 00:34:06,928
(If he succeeds, he gets 1.5kg back. Otherwise, he gets a penalty badge.)

1051
00:34:06,929 --> 00:34:09,129
It's "mag" or "pie". 1, 2, 3.

1052
00:34:09,130 --> 00:34:10,304
- Pie! - Pie!

1053
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:11,599
(Kwang Soo goes bankrupt.)

1054
00:34:11,600 --> 00:34:13,375
This is why people go bankrupt.

1055
00:34:13,630 --> 00:34:14,739
Hey, try one more time.

1056
00:34:14,740 --> 00:34:16,244
(I have a good feeling.)

1057
00:34:16,369 --> 00:34:18,585
At least get back to where you started.

1058
00:34:18,610 --> 00:34:20,038
Should I lend you some of my peanuts?

1059
00:34:20,039 --> 00:34:22,109
- Why would you? - I want to.

1060
00:34:22,110 --> 00:34:23,708
That's how you go bankrup.

1061
00:34:23,709 --> 00:34:25,225
Just pay me back double.

1062
00:34:26,110 --> 00:34:28,324
- Kwang Soo, it's "bankrupt". - "Bankrupt".

1063
00:34:28,780 --> 00:34:30,819
Did you think it was "bankrup"?

1064
00:34:30,820 --> 00:34:32,025
It's "bankrupt".

1065
00:34:32,150 --> 00:34:33,388
- "Bankrupt"? - Yes.

1066
00:34:33,389 --> 00:34:34,634
It's not "bankrup"?

1067
00:34:35,459 --> 00:34:37,159
We don't have much time.

1068
00:34:37,160 --> 00:34:39,034
- Just dig up 2kg. - I'm done.

1069
00:34:39,360 --> 00:34:40,665
This is not fair.

1070
00:34:41,200 --> 00:34:42,929
I just had 0.5kg to go.

1071
00:34:42,930 --> 00:34:44,005
Give me a little.

1072
00:34:44,470 --> 00:34:45,705
I still need some more.

1073
00:34:46,369 --> 00:34:47,429
But I'm almost done.

1074
00:34:47,430 --> 00:34:48,714
(Everyone is motivated by the lowered goal.)

1075
00:34:49,599 --> 00:34:50,668
I'm done.

1076
00:34:50,669 --> 00:34:52,714
Jae Seok, take the rock out of your bag.

1077
00:34:53,369 --> 00:34:54,985
He really pulls all the dirty tricks.

1078
00:34:55,139 --> 00:34:56,755
He had a huge rock in there.

1079
00:34:56,939 --> 00:34:59,009
- It's so big. - Hey, Rock!

1080
00:34:59,010 --> 00:35:00,009
Hey, Rock!

1081
00:35:00,010 --> 00:35:01,395
He's unbelievable.

1082
00:35:01,780 --> 00:35:03,618
(The petty offender's skills are not good enough.)

1083
00:35:03,619 --> 00:35:05,489
- You have a long way to go. - Gosh.

1084
00:35:05,490 --> 00:35:06,989
(Is Kwang Soo already done?)

1085
00:35:06,990 --> 00:35:08,295
Kwang Soo, shake off the dirt first.

1086
00:35:08,419 --> 00:35:10,188
- That's too much dirt. - No.

1087
00:35:10,189 --> 00:35:12,005
- This is not okay. - It's just how it looks.

1088
00:35:12,630 --> 00:35:14,259
That's too much dirt.

1089
00:35:14,260 --> 00:35:15,404
He's not there yet.

1090
00:35:16,300 --> 00:35:17,404
This is 1.5kg.

1091
00:35:17,559 --> 00:35:18,899
There is a bit of dirt in it.

1092
00:35:18,900 --> 00:35:20,598
You almost planted the peanuts back in the dirt.

1093
00:35:20,599 --> 00:35:22,569
No, I didn't.

1094
00:35:22,570 --> 00:35:23,638
- Kwang Soo. - Yes?

1095
00:35:23,639 --> 00:35:25,284
Stop playing such dirty tricks.

1096
00:35:25,309 --> 00:35:26,585
- Didn't you put a rock in your bag? - Hey, Rock!

1097
00:35:27,240 --> 00:35:28,415
Hey, Rock!

1098
00:35:28,539 --> 00:35:30,839
I think I saw a rock around here.

1099
00:35:30,840 --> 00:35:32,149
- Rock! - I mean...

1100
00:35:32,150 --> 00:35:34,895
Didn't you just get scolded for putting a rock in your bag?

1101
00:35:35,180 --> 00:35:36,819
Who says I put a rock in my bag?

1102
00:35:36,820 --> 00:35:38,864
You stole my peanuts and put a rock in your bag.

1103
00:35:39,150 --> 00:35:41,188
- I had to return 1.5kg. - Hey!

1104
00:35:41,189 --> 00:35:42,395
Try one more round.

1105
00:35:42,419 --> 00:35:43,594
Do it!

1106
00:35:44,019 --> 00:35:45,429
- This is your chance. - Right.

1107
00:35:45,430 --> 00:35:47,665
- Bet your life on it. - Just one more round.

1108
00:35:48,099 --> 00:35:49,129
Let's do "shot" and "life" again.

1109
00:35:49,130 --> 00:35:50,359
- Do it. - "Shot" and "life".

1110
00:35:50,360 --> 00:35:52,145
Do you even have any life left to bet?

1111
00:35:52,269 --> 00:35:53,775
This is it.

1112
00:35:53,869 --> 00:35:55,214
- "Shot" or "life". - "Shot" or "life".

1113
00:35:55,769 --> 00:35:56,975
It's "shot" or "life".

1114
00:35:57,570 --> 00:36:02,038
(They believe Kwang Soo can't lose for the third time in a row.)

1115
00:36:02,039 --> 00:36:04,509
(Kwang Soo is betting his life on it. How will it end?)

1116
00:36:04,510 --> 00:36:05,708
- 1, 2, 3. Shot! - Shot!

1117
00:36:05,709 --> 00:36:07,455
(They both say "shot".)

1118
00:36:08,220 --> 00:36:10,179
That reckless brat.

1119
00:36:10,180 --> 00:36:13,395
- This will warn people. - It'll teach people a lesson.

1120
00:36:13,749 --> 00:36:15,259
Gambling is dangerous.

1121
00:36:15,260 --> 00:36:16,688
(He now has to return even the soil-covered peanuts.)

1122
00:36:16,689 --> 00:36:18,058
Ji Hyo might have 2kg.

1123
00:36:18,059 --> 00:36:20,335
(Ji Hyo, who's been working hard, weighs her peanuts.)

1124
00:36:22,030 --> 00:36:24,375
- It's over 2kg. - It's over 2kg.

1125
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:26,074
- It's just 2kg. - It is?

1126
00:36:26,669 --> 00:36:27,775
You pass.

1127
00:36:28,740 --> 00:36:29,915
Okay.

1128
00:36:30,470 --> 00:36:31,938
(The hard-working people's honest achievements)

1129
00:36:31,939 --> 00:36:33,909
Director, I have 2kg.

1130
00:36:33,910 --> 00:36:35,085
You can take a break.

1131
00:36:35,240 --> 00:36:36,554
It must be almost 2kg.

1132
00:36:36,840 --> 00:36:37,985
Let me weigh it.

1133
00:36:38,809 --> 00:36:40,708
(Haha and Jae Seok reach 2kg too.)

1134
00:36:40,709 --> 00:36:41,848
I'm done.

1135
00:36:41,849 --> 00:36:43,594
- It's over 2kg. - I'm finally done.

1136
00:36:43,650 --> 00:36:45,618
Everyone is done now.

1137
00:36:45,619 --> 00:36:48,118
- Peanut butter is ready too. - Okay.

1138
00:36:48,119 --> 00:36:50,159
- You have to stay. - Everyone but Kwang Soo will move.

1139
00:36:50,160 --> 00:36:51,388
- Let's go. - Let's go use the air conditioner.

1140
00:36:51,389 --> 00:36:53,728
Let's go and have a snack.

1141
00:36:53,729 --> 00:36:55,304
- Okay! - Hold on.

1142
00:36:55,400 --> 00:36:56,399
Let's go.

1143
00:36:56,400 --> 00:36:58,868
Still, I can...

1144
00:36:58,869 --> 00:37:00,744
- You don't have time to talk. - Just dig up more peanuts.

1145
00:37:01,669 --> 00:37:04,438
- We'll talk. - We'll talk. You dig up peanuts.

1146
00:37:04,439 --> 00:37:06,339
Kwang Soo crosses the line too often.

1147
00:37:06,340 --> 00:37:07,569
Let's go.

1148
00:37:07,570 --> 00:37:09,355
You should appear on "Those Who Cross the Line".

1149
00:37:09,539 --> 00:37:11,585
Why should I?

1150
00:37:11,780 --> 00:37:12,855
Let's go.

1151
00:37:13,150 --> 00:37:14,485
It serves him right.

1152
00:37:14,650 --> 00:37:17,049
A young man like you...

1153
00:37:17,050 --> 00:37:18,219
(Young man, you should be a man.)

1154
00:37:18,220 --> 00:37:19,994
If they hadn't encouraged me...

1155
00:37:20,550 --> 00:37:22,359
(Jae Seok stops.)

1156
00:37:22,360 --> 00:37:24,235
Wait. Kwang Soo is left alone here.

1157
00:37:24,260 --> 00:37:26,335
Jae Seok, thank you.

1158
00:37:26,889 --> 00:37:27,998
Thank you.

1159
00:37:27,999 --> 00:37:29,574
Kwang Soo, hold this.

1160
00:37:29,959 --> 00:37:32,304
(If you're here to help me, why are you taking this off?)

1161
00:37:32,869 --> 00:37:35,114
(Kwang Soo punches Jae Seok's bottom.)

1162
00:37:35,400 --> 00:37:38,844
(Jae Seok obviously isn't interested in helping Kwang Soo.)

1163
00:37:39,970 --> 00:37:41,779
(Get lost!)

1164
00:37:41,780 --> 00:37:43,714
That was so loud.

1165
00:37:44,510 --> 00:37:45,748
It must hurt a lot.

1166
00:37:45,749 --> 00:37:46,985
He's so annoying.

1167
00:37:47,380 --> 00:37:48,918
Gosh, that guy.

1168
00:37:48,919 --> 00:37:50,118
(Everyone except Kwang Soo gets to try the peanut butter.)

1169
00:37:50,119 --> 00:37:51,824
- How does it taste? - It tastes amazing.

1170
00:37:52,050 --> 00:37:54,018
- Give me some. - It tastes really good.

1171
00:37:54,019 --> 00:37:55,089
It tastes amazing.

1172
00:37:55,090 --> 00:37:57,134
(This peanut butter was prepared right at the farm.)

1173
00:37:57,289 --> 00:37:58,435
Try it.

1174
00:37:59,459 --> 00:38:00,964
- It tastes fantastic. - Oh, my.

1175
00:38:01,860 --> 00:38:03,598
(Peanut butter on toast with cold milk)

1176
00:38:03,599 --> 00:38:06,375
- Give me a lot of milk. - It tastes even better with milk.

1177
00:38:06,829 --> 00:38:08,475
- Kwang Soo is here. - He is?

1178
00:38:08,869 --> 00:38:10,975
Kwang Soo, are you thirsty? Try this.

1179
00:38:11,410 --> 00:38:13,339
- Give me some water. - Try this first.

1180
00:38:13,340 --> 00:38:14,784
You have to taste it.

1181
00:38:15,780 --> 00:38:16,839
It must make him even thirstier.

1182
00:38:16,840 --> 00:38:18,049
(Thirsty)

1183
00:38:18,050 --> 00:38:19,078
All right.

1184
00:38:19,079 --> 00:38:21,348
It's time to vote between "satisfied" and "dissatisfied".

1185
00:38:21,349 --> 00:38:23,978
If everyone is satisfied, the host wins a prize.

1186
00:38:23,979 --> 00:38:25,924
- It's Korean beef. - Oh, my.

1187
00:38:25,950 --> 00:38:27,618
- Right here? - Right here.

1188
00:38:27,619 --> 00:38:30,235
And the host can pick one person to receive a penalty badge.

1189
00:38:30,360 --> 00:38:32,165
If everyone is dissatisfied,

1190
00:38:32,260 --> 00:38:34,659
the host and a person picked by the host will receive...

1191
00:38:34,660 --> 00:38:36,058
two penalty badges each.

1192
00:38:36,059 --> 00:38:38,105
It's not good if everyone is dissatisfied.

1193
00:38:38,130 --> 00:38:40,399
If the majority are satisfied,

1194
00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:43,645
those dissatisfied will receive a penalty badge each.

1195
00:38:43,769 --> 00:38:45,469
If the majority are dissatisfied,

1196
00:38:45,470 --> 00:38:49,038
the host and those satisfied...

1197
00:38:49,039 --> 00:38:51,384
will receive a penalty badge each.

1198
00:38:51,510 --> 00:38:52,679
That's complicated.

1199
00:38:52,680 --> 00:38:55,295
It's not good if everyone is dissatisfied.

1200
00:38:55,419 --> 00:38:57,918
Let me announce how many votes each member has...

1201
00:38:57,919 --> 00:38:59,795
after the hidden mission.

1202
00:38:59,889 --> 00:39:01,989
Jae Seok, Kwang Soo, Haha, Se Chan,

1203
00:39:01,990 --> 00:39:05,235
Jong Kook, and Ji Hyo succeeded once each and have two votes now.

1204
00:39:05,329 --> 00:39:08,058
So Min succeeded 3 times and has 4 votes now.

1205
00:39:08,059 --> 00:39:09,458
How did you do that?

1206
00:39:09,459 --> 00:39:12,469
If Seok Jin guesses the hidden mission right,

1207
00:39:12,470 --> 00:39:14,498
everyone will have only one vote left.

1208
00:39:14,499 --> 00:39:15,799
Wait.

1209
00:39:15,800 --> 00:39:17,275
I can't do that.

1210
00:39:17,439 --> 00:39:18,739
They all must have had different missions.

1211
00:39:18,740 --> 00:39:21,214
(They all must have had different missions.)

1212
00:39:21,740 --> 00:39:23,078
They all had the same mission.

1213
00:39:23,079 --> 00:39:24,315
They did?

1214
00:39:25,610 --> 00:39:26,949
They all had the same mission?

1215
00:39:26,950 --> 00:39:28,154
Hey, So Min.

1216
00:39:28,249 --> 00:39:29,654
Did you carry out the mission here?

1217
00:39:29,849 --> 00:39:31,049
(No comment)

1218
00:39:31,050 --> 00:39:32,225
The mission was to help me, right?

1219
00:39:32,419 --> 00:39:33,694
Of course.

1220
00:39:33,789 --> 00:39:35,235
Or was it to steal something?

1221
00:39:35,389 --> 00:39:36,565
To steal my belongings?

1222
00:39:36,689 --> 00:39:37,759
I'm sure.

1223
00:39:37,760 --> 00:39:39,759
Guys, please react to what I say.

1224
00:39:39,760 --> 00:39:40,958
- Okay. - To steal my belongings?

1225
00:39:40,959 --> 00:39:42,098
(Panicking)

1226
00:39:42,099 --> 00:39:43,235
We can't say anything.

1227
00:39:43,400 --> 00:39:44,498
You have to guess it on your own.

1228
00:39:44,499 --> 00:39:45,645
Say your answer.

1229
00:39:45,769 --> 00:39:46,868
What was the hidden mission?

1230
00:39:46,869 --> 00:39:48,029
(Will Seok Jin guess the stealing mission right?)

1231
00:39:48,030 --> 00:39:49,699
It was to help me.

1232
00:39:49,700 --> 00:39:50,875
(He says the wrong answer.)

1233
00:39:51,410 --> 00:39:52,469
To help me in an obvious way.

1234
00:39:52,470 --> 00:39:54,744
To help you in an obvious way?

1235
00:39:54,780 --> 00:39:55,884
Fail.

1236
00:39:56,380 --> 00:39:57,478
That was close.

1237
00:39:57,479 --> 00:40:00,609
- Gosh, I thought he'd get it. - What's the correct answer?

1238
00:40:00,610 --> 00:40:01,755
It was to steal your belongings.

1239
00:40:02,150 --> 00:40:04,179
- That was it? - He said it in the beginning.

1240
00:40:04,180 --> 00:40:06,219
- Gosh, I was so surprised. - I was panicking.

1241
00:40:06,220 --> 00:40:08,259
I was torn between helping me...

1242
00:40:08,260 --> 00:40:10,618
and stealing my belongings.

1243
00:40:10,619 --> 00:40:11,929
Gosh, that was hard.

1244
00:40:11,930 --> 00:40:13,688
Let me hand out the ballots.

1245
00:40:13,689 --> 00:40:15,159
It's not good if everyone is dissatisfied.

1246
00:40:15,160 --> 00:40:17,034
- We have no choice. - What should we do?

1247
00:40:17,229 --> 00:40:19,475
What should I do? I have so many votes.

1248
00:40:20,030 --> 00:40:23,574
If you vote "satisfied" and the majority are dissatisfied,

1249
00:40:24,139 --> 00:40:25,268
you'll receive a penalty badge.

1250
00:40:25,269 --> 00:40:26,784
(The majority... Dissatisfied... Badges...)

1251
00:40:26,869 --> 00:40:27,909
He doesn't seem to understand.

1252
00:40:27,910 --> 00:40:29,109
(Surprised)

1253
00:40:29,110 --> 00:40:31,009
Don't think too much.

1254
00:40:31,010 --> 00:40:32,255
Are you satisfied or dissatisfied?

1255
00:40:32,479 --> 00:40:34,585
I'll just go with my gut feeling.

1256
00:40:35,180 --> 00:40:36,478
Seriously...

1257
00:40:36,479 --> 00:40:39,225
Don't think too much. Just be honest.

1258
00:40:39,289 --> 00:40:41,659
- Let me announce the result. - It's out already?

1259
00:40:41,660 --> 00:40:45,429
Out of 16 votes, how many votes were for satisfied?

1260
00:40:45,430 --> 00:40:47,129
- Were there votes for satisfied? - I knew it.

1261
00:40:47,130 --> 00:40:49,259
(There are votes for satisfied.)

1262
00:40:49,260 --> 00:40:52,699
(The members were pretty favorable to harvesting and tasting.)

1263
00:40:52,700 --> 00:40:54,938
(There could be many votes for satisfied.)

1264
00:40:54,939 --> 00:40:58,409
(Are many votes for dissatisfied since they worked under the sun?)

1265
00:40:58,410 --> 00:41:01,069
(Out of 16 votes,)

1266
00:41:01,070 --> 00:41:03,815
(how many votes were for satisfied?)

1267
00:41:04,639 --> 00:41:06,284
There are votes for satisfied.

1268
00:41:07,010 --> 00:41:08,248
None.

1269
00:41:08,249 --> 00:41:09,355
(There were no votes for satisfied.)

1270
00:41:09,950 --> 00:41:12,348
(Did everyone choose dissatisfied?)

1271
00:41:12,349 --> 00:41:14,649
Who would be satisfied in this weather?

1272
00:41:14,650 --> 00:41:17,835
- The weather played a big role. - We had no choice.

1273
00:41:18,019 --> 00:41:19,859
Since everyone was dissatisfied,

1274
00:41:19,860 --> 00:41:21,728
the host will receive two penalty badges.

1275
00:41:21,729 --> 00:41:24,529
The member of the host's choosing will receive two penalty badges too.

1276
00:41:24,530 --> 00:41:25,868
(The host and 1 member will receive 2 penalty badges.)

1277
00:41:25,869 --> 00:41:28,375
No matter your effort, the situation was too bad.

1278
00:41:28,470 --> 00:41:30,614
You are too flippant.

1279
00:41:31,269 --> 00:41:33,009
- What do you mean? - You are too flippant.

1280
00:41:33,010 --> 00:41:34,315
- It's not like that. - He is too flippant.

1281
00:41:34,410 --> 00:41:37,009
Wasn't Jong Kook the worst?

1282
00:41:37,010 --> 00:41:39,924
"Peel the sweet potatoes, give me 90 dollars or 30 dollars..."

1283
00:41:39,950 --> 00:41:43,725
If you give me penalty badges, make sure to send me 90 dollars.

1284
00:41:46,289 --> 00:41:47,688
Make sure to send me 90 dollars.

1285
00:41:47,689 --> 00:41:49,565
Each badge is worth 45 dollars.

1286
00:41:49,619 --> 00:41:51,188
It would be better to give all of them to one person.

1287
00:41:51,189 --> 00:41:52,828
Did Kwang Soo get a badge?

1288
00:41:52,829 --> 00:41:54,388
Kwang Soo has one penalty badge.

1289
00:41:54,389 --> 00:41:55,399
- He does? - Why?

1290
00:41:55,400 --> 00:41:57,558
- Earlier... - He bet his life.

1291
00:41:57,559 --> 00:41:59,629
- Then... - You should give them to him.

1292
00:41:59,630 --> 00:42:02,275
it's more advantageous for me to give them to him.

1293
00:42:02,570 --> 00:42:04,815
(Kwang Soo suddenly becomes a candidate.)

1294
00:42:06,240 --> 00:42:07,368
He just cursed at me.

1295
00:42:07,369 --> 00:42:08,509
(Laughing)

1296
00:42:08,510 --> 00:42:10,379
We should give the penalty badges to one person.

1297
00:42:10,380 --> 00:42:13,384
Choose Kwang Soo again for the next activity.

1298
00:42:13,479 --> 00:42:15,255
Then he will get more penalty badges.

1299
00:42:16,720 --> 00:42:18,364
If you do that,

1300
00:42:19,019 --> 00:42:20,449
- it's going to be difficult. - Haha.

1301
00:42:20,450 --> 00:42:22,235
(Haha)

1302
00:42:22,289 --> 00:42:23,359
Haha.

1303
00:42:23,360 --> 00:42:25,005
- Give them to Kwang Soo. - Okay.

1304
00:42:25,559 --> 00:42:27,228
- Here you go. - That's the way to go.

1305
00:42:27,229 --> 00:42:29,275
- One Eyed Jack. - One Eyed Jack.

1306
00:42:29,360 --> 00:42:31,199
- You bet your life. - This is right.

1307
00:42:31,200 --> 00:42:33,569
- Strategically, this is right. - This is right.

1308
00:42:33,570 --> 00:42:35,469
The first activity ended.

1309
00:42:35,470 --> 00:42:37,969
Let's pick the next activity.

1310
00:42:37,970 --> 00:42:40,685
I hope he doesn't pick mine. It's too hard to be the host.

1311
00:42:40,809 --> 00:42:42,485
The next activity is...

1312
00:42:43,439 --> 00:42:44,609
"Date with Joo Jin Mo".

1313
00:42:44,610 --> 00:42:45,879
(Haha's "Date with Joo Jin Mo")

1314
00:42:45,880 --> 00:42:47,109
- What? - Whose is it?

1315
00:42:47,110 --> 00:42:48,449
- It's Haha's. - What?

1316
00:42:48,450 --> 00:42:50,379
- Whose is it? - We will go to the zoo.

1317
00:42:50,380 --> 00:42:52,395
- A zoo. - "Date with Joo Jin Mo".

1318
00:42:52,419 --> 00:42:54,219
- We're going to a zoo? - Yes.

1319
00:42:54,220 --> 00:42:56,494
Let's just say we went to the zoo.

1320
00:42:56,590 --> 00:42:58,264
I think I will pick Kwang Soo anyway.

1321
00:42:58,889 --> 00:43:00,304
Can you give me a chance?

1322
00:43:00,660 --> 00:43:02,998
You really bet your life earlier.

1323
00:43:02,999 --> 00:43:05,074
I can see myself in five hours.

1324
00:43:05,430 --> 00:43:06,629
Is there a way?

1325
00:43:06,630 --> 00:43:07,668
You never know.

1326
00:43:07,669 --> 00:43:08,998
Kwang Soo, you never know.

1327
00:43:08,999 --> 00:43:10,268
- You never know. - You never know.

1328
00:43:10,269 --> 00:43:12,438
If Haha gives two penalty badges...

1329
00:43:12,439 --> 00:43:13,868
- to Seok Jin... - Seok Jin.

1330
00:43:13,869 --> 00:43:15,438
- That's right. - If he gives them to Seok Jin...

1331
00:43:15,439 --> 00:43:17,009
- Seok Jin. - That's right, Haha.

1332
00:43:17,010 --> 00:43:18,625
What should I do? Oh, my.

1333
00:43:18,650 --> 00:43:19,808
Seriously.

1334
00:43:19,809 --> 00:43:21,719
Let's get started.

1335
00:43:21,720 --> 00:43:23,819
Please give it up for the host of "Date with Joo Jin Mo".

1336
00:43:23,820 --> 00:43:24,895
(Bragging)

1337
00:43:24,919 --> 00:43:27,518
- I am excited! - You know,

1338
00:43:27,519 --> 00:43:28,958
this activity has...

1339
00:43:28,959 --> 00:43:31,359
two candidates for the penalty badges.

1340
00:43:31,360 --> 00:43:32,759
I will make them say hello.

1341
00:43:32,760 --> 00:43:35,498
There are two employees.

1342
00:43:35,499 --> 00:43:36,598
("Date with Joo Jin Mo" has two employees.)

1343
00:43:36,599 --> 00:43:40,744
He has been a manager for 20 years.

1344
00:43:40,869 --> 00:43:43,038
- A manager! - He is Jee Seok Jin.

1345
00:43:43,039 --> 00:43:44,368
My goodness.

1346
00:43:44,369 --> 00:43:45,768
He is an animal expert.

1347
00:43:45,769 --> 00:43:47,739
Don't you have a peanut field?

1348
00:43:47,740 --> 00:43:49,308
He has a peanut field. That's right.

1349
00:43:49,309 --> 00:43:50,379
Really?

1350
00:43:50,380 --> 00:43:52,348
I didn't expect to see the owner of a peanut field.

1351
00:43:52,349 --> 00:43:54,609
The second employee...

1352
00:43:54,610 --> 00:43:57,549
can connect with giraffes and kiss them.

1353
00:43:57,550 --> 00:43:59,089
He is a young employee.

1354
00:43:59,090 --> 00:44:01,049
He has worked for 20 years as well.

1355
00:44:01,050 --> 00:44:03,395
- His name is Lee Kwang Soo. - Hello.

1356
00:44:03,590 --> 00:44:06,888
I plan to take a break today...

1357
00:44:06,889 --> 00:44:08,899
- because I am busy. - Okay.

1358
00:44:08,900 --> 00:44:10,598
The two of them will take good care of you.

1359
00:44:10,599 --> 00:44:12,268
- It's their job. - Give them a big hand.

1360
00:44:12,269 --> 00:44:14,129
- Work hard. - It will be fun.

1361
00:44:14,130 --> 00:44:16,569
- I get to be the host again? - Of course.

1362
00:44:16,570 --> 00:44:18,114
- After the peanut field... - Shall we get going?

1363
00:44:18,570 --> 00:44:21,614
- Let's go. - This is giving me a headache.

1364
00:44:23,139 --> 00:44:25,248
We are going to the zoo.

1365
00:44:25,249 --> 00:44:26,848
(They are near the zoo.)

1366
00:44:26,849 --> 00:44:27,879
I am excited.

1367
00:44:27,880 --> 00:44:30,018
I haven't been to the zoo in a while. I am excited.

1368
00:44:30,019 --> 00:44:32,049
(The zoo makes you go back to your childhood days.)

1369
00:44:32,050 --> 00:44:33,518
This is the place.

1370
00:44:33,519 --> 00:44:36,565
(Which animals will they act as moms?)

1371
00:44:37,619 --> 00:44:40,665
(Mom, hurry over.)

1372
00:44:40,889 --> 00:44:43,558
You have arrived at the place...

1373
00:44:43,559 --> 00:44:45,875
for the second vacation activity, "Date with Joo Jin Mo".

1374
00:44:46,470 --> 00:44:49,045
- Haha, please exit the bus first. - Okay.

1375
00:44:49,200 --> 00:44:52,038
Everyone, go easy on me.

1376
00:44:52,039 --> 00:44:53,284
All right.

1377
00:44:53,439 --> 00:44:54,868
I hope this one will be easier.

1378
00:44:54,869 --> 00:44:56,855
The second hidden mission is...

1379
00:44:57,740 --> 00:44:59,649
getting on the host's back.

1380
00:44:59,650 --> 00:45:01,779
(The second hidden mission, getting on the host's back)

1381
00:45:01,780 --> 00:45:03,379
- This is bad. - He would know right away.

1382
00:45:03,380 --> 00:45:05,094
He would know.

1383
00:45:05,189 --> 00:45:06,388
What could be the secret mission?

1384
00:45:06,389 --> 00:45:08,494
(Every time they get on Haha's back, they will get an additional vote.)

1385
00:45:08,720 --> 00:45:11,259
Let's do things that are similar to getting on his back.

1386
00:45:11,260 --> 00:45:12,728
- That's right. - Things of the same magnitude.

1387
00:45:12,729 --> 00:45:14,058
Things of the same magnitude.

1388
00:45:14,059 --> 00:45:16,159
Only a few people should try...

1389
00:45:16,160 --> 00:45:17,828
No, no, That's not it.

1390
00:45:17,829 --> 00:45:18,975
(No, no, That's not it.)

1391
00:45:19,329 --> 00:45:21,799
- You didn't even let me finish! - Let him give ideas.

1392
00:45:21,800 --> 00:45:23,899
- "That's not it"? - Don't get emotional.

1393
00:45:23,900 --> 00:45:25,638
- You didn't even listen to it. - That's not it.

1394
00:45:25,639 --> 00:45:26,768
(It's bound to be a useless strategy.)

1395
00:45:26,769 --> 00:45:28,985
He means nothing you say will work.

1396
00:45:29,240 --> 00:45:30,455
(They enter the zoo after receiving the hidden mission.)

1397
00:45:30,979 --> 00:45:34,025
This vacation activity is "Date with Joo Jin Mo".

1398
00:45:34,380 --> 00:45:37,418
You will connect with animals as their real moms.

1399
00:45:37,419 --> 00:45:40,489
There are four types of animals that need your special attention...

1400
00:45:40,490 --> 00:45:43,058
(There are four types of animals that need your special attention.)

1401
00:45:43,059 --> 00:45:44,859
- at this zoo. - I see.

1402
00:45:44,860 --> 00:45:45,888
(Four types of animals?)

1403
00:45:45,889 --> 00:45:48,328
You will split into groups of two...

1404
00:45:48,329 --> 00:45:50,475
- and connect with the animals. - Groups of two?

1405
00:45:50,630 --> 00:45:54,268
Check the items and split into groups of two.

1406
00:45:54,269 --> 00:45:55,538
What's "Norang"?

1407
00:45:55,539 --> 00:45:57,498
It's a name. Norang, Sun, Minky, Jollang,

1408
00:45:57,499 --> 00:45:59,069
- and Baram are all names. - "Make eye contact."

1409
00:45:59,070 --> 00:46:01,114
Making eye contact would be the best.

1410
00:46:01,240 --> 00:46:02,909
- "Make eye contact". - "Give a bath"?

1411
00:46:02,910 --> 00:46:04,578
- I think I know what Norang is. - This one is the best.

1412
00:46:04,579 --> 00:46:06,384
Giving a bath would be the hardest.

1413
00:46:06,479 --> 00:46:09,248
All of these tasks are hard.

1414
00:46:09,249 --> 00:46:11,625
Pick two representatives for each task.

1415
00:46:11,820 --> 00:46:13,949
I will do the task for Norang.

1416
00:46:13,950 --> 00:46:15,589
I will give Sun a bath.

1417
00:46:15,590 --> 00:46:17,719
- Ji Hyo and I will give a bath. - Okay.

1418
00:46:17,720 --> 00:46:18,929
Let's clean the cage.

1419
00:46:18,930 --> 00:46:20,665
- Okay. - All right.

1420
00:46:20,990 --> 00:46:24,259
(Partners for the activities)

1421
00:46:24,260 --> 00:46:27,199
Let's meet the cute Norang first.

1422
00:46:27,200 --> 00:46:29,038
(Hold Norang and make eye contact.)

1423
00:46:29,039 --> 00:46:30,199
It must be a bird.

1424
00:46:30,200 --> 00:46:32,168
- Is it a bird? - It must be a bird.

1425
00:46:32,169 --> 00:46:33,714
Norang must be a bird.

1426
00:46:33,809 --> 00:46:35,779
- A parakeet? - Parakeets and mynas.

1427
00:46:35,780 --> 00:46:37,779
- Where? - This is a nice task.

1428
00:46:37,780 --> 00:46:39,424
(They look around the zoo.)

1429
00:46:40,550 --> 00:46:42,025
It's an Amazonian fish.

1430
00:46:43,579 --> 00:46:44,879
My goodness.

1431
00:46:44,880 --> 00:46:46,089
What is that?

1432
00:46:46,090 --> 00:46:47,924
It's an Amazonian fish.

1433
00:46:48,019 --> 00:46:50,188
- Doesn't this live in the Amazon? - Arowana.

1434
00:46:50,189 --> 00:46:51,458
Arowana.

1435
00:46:51,459 --> 00:46:52,665
That's right.

1436
00:46:52,990 --> 00:46:54,589
- Meerkats. - How cute!

1437
00:46:54,590 --> 00:46:56,558
Aren't these the animals in "The Lion King"?

1438
00:46:56,559 --> 00:46:58,335
- Look at those rabbits. - Timon and Pumbaa.

1439
00:46:58,499 --> 00:47:00,799
- Hello. - Please come this way.

1440
00:47:00,800 --> 00:47:02,969
- How pretty! - They are so cute.

1441
00:47:02,970 --> 00:47:04,498
There are a lot of animals.

1442
00:47:04,499 --> 00:47:06,284
There is a turtle too.

1443
00:47:06,510 --> 00:47:09,955
Gosh, look at the turtle poop!

1444
00:47:10,240 --> 00:47:11,679
- What? - The turtle poop is so big.

1445
00:47:11,680 --> 00:47:14,578
- Where? What is it like? - It's the size of the turtle.

1446
00:47:14,579 --> 00:47:15,819
It's really big.

1447
00:47:15,820 --> 00:47:16,819
(A turtle poops a lot and squashes it with its body.)

1448
00:47:16,820 --> 00:47:18,949
- That's a big poop. - My goodness.

1449
00:47:18,950 --> 00:47:20,665
Isn't that charcoal?

1450
00:47:20,950 --> 00:47:22,788
It's not charcoal. It's a sweet potato.

1451
00:47:22,789 --> 00:47:23,859
(Eating and pooping well is the secret to a long life.)

1452
00:47:23,860 --> 00:47:25,435
It's no joke.

1453
00:47:25,490 --> 00:47:28,659
Let's tackle the first mission on the list.

1454
00:47:28,660 --> 00:47:30,335
The first one is about Norang.

1455
00:47:30,700 --> 00:47:33,268
"Hold Norang and make eye contact."

1456
00:47:33,269 --> 00:47:36,645
Let's meet Norang, the cutest animal in this zoo.

1457
00:47:37,340 --> 00:47:39,509
Norang, come on out.

1458
00:47:39,510 --> 00:47:40,844
We should at least kiss it.

1459
00:47:40,939 --> 00:47:41,978
(Screaming)

1460
00:47:41,979 --> 00:47:43,114
I saw it!

1461
00:47:43,380 --> 00:47:45,185
(Goosebumps)

1462
00:47:45,710 --> 00:47:48,715
(What kind of animal is the cute Norang?)

1463
00:47:49,762 --> 00:47:52,732
(What kind of animal is the cute Norang?)

1464
00:47:54,079 --> 00:47:56,895
(Norang enters.)

1465
00:47:57,689 --> 00:48:01,259
(The cute mascot of the zoo, Norang)

1466
00:48:01,260 --> 00:48:04,935
(Norang is a 13-year-old albino Burmese python.)

1467
00:48:06,530 --> 00:48:08,774
Kwang Soo, come here.

1468
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:11,129
- I am glad I didn't choose this. - It's really big.

1469
00:48:11,130 --> 00:48:13,475
- My goodness. - You would die if it strangles you.

1470
00:48:14,570 --> 00:48:16,814
I can't even touch it.

1471
00:48:16,969 --> 00:48:18,709
- Touch it. - No, no.

1472
00:48:18,710 --> 00:48:20,714
- I am getting goosebumps. - It's okay.

1473
00:48:20,909 --> 00:48:24,109
It feels like I am touching a bag.

1474
00:48:24,110 --> 00:48:26,118
- I am getting goosebumps. - A snakeskin bag.

1475
00:48:26,119 --> 00:48:28,149
(The youngest members try touching the snake.)

1476
00:48:28,150 --> 00:48:29,149
That's what it feels like.

1477
00:48:29,150 --> 00:48:30,618
- Gosh, Jong Kook. - Right?

1478
00:48:30,619 --> 00:48:32,518
- That's what it feels like. - Kwang Soo.

1479
00:48:32,519 --> 00:48:33,589
(I can't do this.)

1480
00:48:33,590 --> 00:48:35,959
Norang is a snake that turned 13 this year.

1481
00:48:35,960 --> 00:48:39,165
It boasts its beautiful color and length of 2m and 30cm.

1482
00:48:39,230 --> 00:48:41,729
Jong Kook and Kwang Soo, you chose to connect with Norang.

1483
00:48:41,730 --> 00:48:44,944
Hold Norang and keep eye contact for three seconds.

1484
00:48:45,630 --> 00:48:48,499
(The zoo owner and employee are scared.)

1485
00:48:48,500 --> 00:48:52,069
I did it once during the photoshoot for the calendar.

1486
00:48:52,070 --> 00:48:53,138
I was dripping in sweat.

1487
00:48:53,139 --> 00:48:55,109
(He forgot about...)

1488
00:48:55,110 --> 00:48:57,625
(how much he sweated that day.)

1489
00:48:59,349 --> 00:49:02,594
(The affectionate snake made Jae Seok very happy.)

1490
00:49:04,650 --> 00:49:06,459
Give it a try.

1491
00:49:06,460 --> 00:49:07,759
My goodness.

1492
00:49:07,760 --> 00:49:10,004
Is anyone not scared of snakes?

1493
00:49:10,030 --> 00:49:11,305
Is anyone willing to switch missions?

1494
00:49:11,530 --> 00:49:15,299
You should have this experience.

1495
00:49:15,300 --> 00:49:17,745
As an employee of the zoo,

1496
00:49:18,099 --> 00:49:21,098
you should make the visitors happy.

1497
00:49:21,099 --> 00:49:24,745
In my life, I have never touched a snake.

1498
00:49:25,239 --> 00:49:26,879
I will go first.

1499
00:49:26,880 --> 00:49:28,214
(This is nothing.)

1500
00:49:28,579 --> 00:49:31,555
(Norang's muscular mom, Jong Kook steps forward.)

1501
00:49:31,909 --> 00:49:34,649
It opened its mouth. It opened a little.

1502
00:49:34,650 --> 00:49:36,825
It's smelling the air because it wants to eat something.

1503
00:49:37,849 --> 00:49:39,759
(Despite Norang's movements, Jong Kook doesn't hesitate.)

1504
00:49:39,760 --> 00:49:40,835
All right.

1505
00:49:41,360 --> 00:49:43,759
(He succeeds to get Norang on his shoulders.)

1506
00:49:43,760 --> 00:49:45,288
(Kwang Soo is already getting goosebumps.)

1507
00:49:45,289 --> 00:49:47,335
- Are you okay? - Of course.

1508
00:49:47,460 --> 00:49:49,404
- My goodness. - Like this?

1509
00:49:49,630 --> 00:49:50,868
Sometimes...

1510
00:49:50,869 --> 00:49:52,768
- You should give it a kiss. - Sometimes,

1511
00:49:52,769 --> 00:49:53,975
the snakes constrict.

1512
00:49:54,369 --> 00:49:56,138
(Now, he needs to make eye contact with Norang.)

1513
00:49:56,139 --> 00:49:58,209
- Kwang Soo. - Kwang Soo is scared.

1514
00:49:58,210 --> 00:49:59,268
(I can't do this.)

1515
00:49:59,269 --> 00:50:01,009
It's moving.

1516
00:50:01,010 --> 00:50:02,355
(Norang moves when it's close to Jong Kook's face.)

1517
00:50:03,210 --> 00:50:05,154
(My goodness.)

1518
00:50:05,510 --> 00:50:09,455
1, 2, 3. Mission success.

1519
00:50:10,719 --> 00:50:13,094
(Relaxed)

1520
00:50:13,460 --> 00:50:16,859
Kwang Soo, it was about to show its fangs.

1521
00:50:16,860 --> 00:50:19,189
(He scares Kwang Soo right away.)

1522
00:50:19,190 --> 00:50:22,868
Kwang Soo, I am serious. It was about to show its fangs.

1523
00:50:22,869 --> 00:50:23,868
(Why would you say that?)

1524
00:50:23,869 --> 00:50:25,629
Its mouth...

1525
00:50:25,630 --> 00:50:26,638
(Norang is angry.)

1526
00:50:26,639 --> 00:50:29,169
- You know what I mean, right? - What does it eat?

1527
00:50:29,170 --> 00:50:31,638
- This one eats white mice. - It eats white mice, right?

1528
00:50:31,639 --> 00:50:33,185
- It eats white mice. - I see.

1529
00:50:33,210 --> 00:50:35,984
Then it could eat a person's nose.

1530
00:50:36,039 --> 00:50:39,348
If it bites, you will only get two holes on your face.

1531
00:50:39,349 --> 00:50:40,848
(You will only get two holes on your face.)

1532
00:50:40,849 --> 00:50:42,718
Think of it as a piercing. A nose piercing.

1533
00:50:42,719 --> 00:50:44,488
When did it eat?

1534
00:50:44,489 --> 00:50:46,218
It ate...

1535
00:50:46,219 --> 00:50:47,819
about a week ago.

1536
00:50:47,820 --> 00:50:48,819
(Has it been a week ago?)

1537
00:50:48,820 --> 00:50:51,359
- A week? - It's time for a meal.

1538
00:50:51,360 --> 00:50:53,004
It's time for a meal.

1539
00:50:53,130 --> 00:50:55,129
When I held it, it opened its mouth.

1540
00:50:55,130 --> 00:50:56,229
(There was a reason why it opened its mouth.)

1541
00:50:56,230 --> 00:50:58,098
It opened its mouth.

1542
00:50:58,099 --> 00:50:59,575
- I... - Should I put it around you?

1543
00:51:00,099 --> 00:51:01,468
My goodness.

1544
00:51:01,469 --> 00:51:03,785
If you stay still...

1545
00:51:04,010 --> 00:51:05,839
(Screaming)

1546
00:51:05,840 --> 00:51:07,979
(He screams before the snake touches his body.)

1547
00:51:07,980 --> 00:51:09,984
- Kwang Soo. - My goodness.

1548
00:51:10,050 --> 00:51:11,754
- It didn't even touch him. - By any chance... Hold on.

1549
00:51:12,510 --> 00:51:13,618
(Can I be put under anesthesia?)

1550
00:51:13,619 --> 00:51:14,948
Can I be put under anesthesia?

1551
00:51:14,949 --> 00:51:16,154
For goodness' sake.

1552
00:51:16,920 --> 00:51:18,265
I mean...

1553
00:51:18,750 --> 00:51:21,194
Even children can do it.

1554
00:51:21,219 --> 00:51:23,828
- It could bite like this. - In a second...

1555
00:51:23,829 --> 00:51:25,759
- It could bite like this. - In a second, it will bite.

1556
00:51:25,760 --> 00:51:27,734
I wish I could do this for you, but I was born in the year of the rat.

1557
00:51:29,030 --> 00:51:31,629
(Norang eats mice.)

1558
00:51:31,630 --> 00:51:33,399
That has nothing to do with this.

1559
00:51:33,400 --> 00:51:34,399
I was born in the year of the rat.

1560
00:51:34,400 --> 00:51:35,638
I will do it.

1561
00:51:35,639 --> 00:51:37,138
(He convinces himself and tries again.)

1562
00:51:37,139 --> 00:51:38,339
(He becomes scared as soon as it touches him.)

1563
00:51:38,340 --> 00:51:40,479
Would you please count to three?

1564
00:51:40,480 --> 00:51:42,754
- I am sorry. - Count to three?

1565
00:51:43,079 --> 00:51:45,379
It's okay. Let's go.

1566
00:51:45,380 --> 00:51:46,379
(He is very nervous.)

1567
00:51:46,380 --> 00:51:47,379
All right.

1568
00:51:47,380 --> 00:51:49,325
(Jong Kook pinches him.)

1569
00:51:51,050 --> 00:51:53,459
(The smallest contact...)

1570
00:51:53,460 --> 00:51:55,995
(makes him sensitive.)

1571
00:51:57,030 --> 00:51:58,205
(It's so fun to tease Kwang Soo.)

1572
00:51:58,760 --> 00:52:00,859
(It might be faster for him to receive penalty badges.)

1573
00:52:00,860 --> 00:52:03,098
- Kwang Soo. - Hang in there.

1574
00:52:03,099 --> 00:52:04,774
- I can't do this. - Hold the head.

1575
00:52:06,369 --> 00:52:07,439
(His facial expression freezes.)

1576
00:52:07,440 --> 00:52:08,774
Kwang Soo, forget it.

1577
00:52:09,639 --> 00:52:12,138
- You look like a fool. - Forget it.

1578
00:52:12,139 --> 00:52:13,638
- Get up, coward. - I will do it.

1579
00:52:13,639 --> 00:52:15,109
I will do it. Let's do it.

1580
00:52:15,110 --> 00:52:16,379
I don't think you can do this.

1581
00:52:16,380 --> 00:52:18,078
I will do it. I can do it.

1582
00:52:18,079 --> 00:52:19,384
This is...

1583
00:52:20,250 --> 00:52:21,995
(At that moment)

1584
00:52:22,650 --> 00:52:24,549
It's me. It's me.

1585
00:52:24,550 --> 00:52:26,634
(He gets shocked for real.)

1586
00:52:26,820 --> 00:52:29,064
It's me. It's me.

1587
00:52:29,659 --> 00:52:31,658
It's me. It's me.

1588
00:52:31,659 --> 00:52:33,705
When I poked his bottom, he flinched.

1589
00:52:33,800 --> 00:52:34,828
It's me. It's me.

1590
00:52:34,829 --> 00:52:38,229
(Even when he pretends to be strong, he can't hide his fear.)

1591
00:52:38,230 --> 00:52:40,944
- It's me. It's me. - He can't do it.

1592
00:52:40,969 --> 00:52:42,844
- My goodness. - I will do it.

1593
00:52:43,110 --> 00:52:44,238
I will put it around your shoulders.

1594
00:52:44,239 --> 00:52:46,138
(He sets his mind and tries for the 2nd time.)

1595
00:52:46,139 --> 00:52:48,439
- My goodness. - He is suppressing his fear.

1596
00:52:48,440 --> 00:52:51,709
(He succeeds to put the snake around his neck.)

1597
00:52:51,710 --> 00:52:53,848
Kwang Soo, make eye contact.

1598
00:52:53,849 --> 00:52:55,348
- Where is it? - It's to your left.

1599
00:52:55,349 --> 00:52:56,618
- You need to look at it. - Diagonal to your left.

1600
00:52:56,619 --> 00:52:58,218
You need to look at it. Look to your left.

1601
00:52:58,219 --> 00:52:59,549
- No, no. - It's only three seconds.

1602
00:52:59,550 --> 00:53:00,988
- It's at one o'clock. - You just need to look at it.

1603
00:53:00,989 --> 00:53:03,165
- You just need to look at it. - The snake is looking at you.

1604
00:53:04,960 --> 00:53:06,499
- Come on and look at it. - I am making eye contact.

1605
00:53:06,500 --> 00:53:08,805
- No, you are not. - Gosh, what is this?

1606
00:53:09,460 --> 00:53:10,904
Gosh, what is this?

1607
00:53:11,969 --> 00:53:14,214
(Norang's tail heads to Kwang Soo's crotch.)

1608
00:53:14,539 --> 00:53:16,174
(Why did it go over there?)

1609
00:53:17,010 --> 00:53:18,839
Are you okay?

1610
00:53:18,840 --> 00:53:20,114
I am okay.

1611
00:53:20,210 --> 00:53:21,339
Let's begin.

1612
00:53:21,340 --> 00:53:22,709
Hurry up and make eye contact.

1613
00:53:22,710 --> 00:53:25,009
- Hurry up. - 1, 2, 3.

1614
00:53:25,010 --> 00:53:26,325
Three seconds.

1615
00:53:26,449 --> 00:53:28,955
- 3 seconds. - 1, 2, 3.

1616
00:53:29,150 --> 00:53:31,049
- One, - Come on, Kwang Soo.

1617
00:53:31,050 --> 00:53:32,194
two,

1618
00:53:32,349 --> 00:53:33,558
three. Mission success.

1619
00:53:33,559 --> 00:53:36,158
(1, 2, 3. Mission success.)

1620
00:53:36,159 --> 00:53:37,259
Mission success.

1621
00:53:37,260 --> 00:53:38,634
(I can't believe a coward like him did it.)

1622
00:53:39,559 --> 00:53:41,499
(His soul escaped his body.)

1623
00:53:41,500 --> 00:53:42,658
Kwang Soo, good job.

1624
00:53:42,659 --> 00:53:44,229
Thank you for your hard work.

1625
00:53:44,230 --> 00:53:46,468
- Thank you. - Thank you for your hard work.

1626
00:53:46,469 --> 00:53:47,968
- Thank you. - Thank you.

1627
00:53:47,969 --> 00:53:49,844
- Thank you. - Bye, Norang.

1628
00:53:50,309 --> 00:53:52,145
I think you need a massage.

1629
00:53:53,079 --> 00:53:54,178
(Feed Minky and take a selfie with satisfied Minky.)

1630
00:53:54,179 --> 00:53:55,538
Please come this way.

1631
00:53:55,539 --> 00:53:58,484
It's your favorite animal, the fennec fox.

1632
00:53:58,909 --> 00:54:00,649
It's in "The Little Prince".

1633
00:54:00,650 --> 00:54:02,479
- How cute! - That's right.

1634
00:54:02,480 --> 00:54:04,089
- How cute! - They are fennec foxes.

1635
00:54:04,090 --> 00:54:06,125
- Hello. - They are so cute.

1636
00:54:07,159 --> 00:54:08,288
- Would you like to hold them? - Can we do that?

1637
00:54:08,289 --> 00:54:10,089
- We can hold fennec foxes. - We can hold them.

1638
00:54:10,090 --> 00:54:11,189
I would love to do that.

1639
00:54:11,190 --> 00:54:12,658
- They are so cute. - They are like dogs.

1640
00:54:12,659 --> 00:54:14,259
They are so cute. They are lying down.

1641
00:54:14,260 --> 00:54:15,774
- Don't they bite? - No.

1642
00:54:16,059 --> 00:54:17,875
They are like babies.

1643
00:54:18,630 --> 00:54:20,368
- They are like babies. - How cute!

1644
00:54:20,369 --> 00:54:23,209
Let's move on to the next mission.

1645
00:54:23,210 --> 00:54:25,738
So Min, we need to go to Minky.

1646
00:54:25,739 --> 00:54:28,178
- Minky? - They are foxes.

1647
00:54:28,179 --> 00:54:31,424
(After meeting the fennec foxes, they move on to the next mission.)

1648
00:54:33,219 --> 00:54:34,995
- These are crocodiles. - Crocodiles.

1649
00:54:36,079 --> 00:54:38,749
- We already met some crocodiles! - Crocodiles?

1650
00:54:38,750 --> 00:54:41,464
- We already met some crocodiles! - We already had a similar mission.

1651
00:54:43,230 --> 00:54:47,575
(A group of crocodiles appears before their eyes.)

1652
00:54:49,659 --> 00:54:51,229
Thank goodness we are up here.

1653
00:54:51,230 --> 00:54:53,868
This one is moving. This one is moving.

1654
00:54:53,869 --> 00:54:57,038
(The crocodiles gather around the people.)

1655
00:54:57,039 --> 00:54:58,109
- They are coming. - They are so big.

1656
00:54:58,110 --> 00:54:59,415
They are so big.

1657
00:54:59,639 --> 00:55:00,884
They are so big.

1658
00:55:01,539 --> 00:55:03,185
This is no joke.

1659
00:55:04,110 --> 00:55:06,718
Minky, the crocodile that turned 32 this year,

1660
00:55:06,719 --> 00:55:09,749
is the biggest crocodile in this zoo.

1661
00:55:09,750 --> 00:55:11,118
We met Chopper.

1662
00:55:11,119 --> 00:55:13,288
- We met Chopper. - It's really big.

1663
00:55:13,289 --> 00:55:15,988
Jae Seok and So Min, find and feed Minky.

1664
00:55:15,989 --> 00:55:18,464
Then take a selfie with it when it's satisfied.

1665
00:55:19,190 --> 00:55:21,558
How do we know if Minky is satisfied or not?

1666
00:55:21,559 --> 00:55:23,569
- Seriously. - Take a selfie with Minky?

1667
00:55:23,570 --> 00:55:26,814
Give Minky raw chicken for dinner.

1668
00:55:26,869 --> 00:55:28,138
They won't go down, will they?

1669
00:55:28,139 --> 00:55:29,169
They need to do it from here.

1670
00:55:29,170 --> 00:55:30,538
(They won't go down, will they?)

1671
00:55:30,539 --> 00:55:31,609
They need to do it from here.

1672
00:55:31,610 --> 00:55:33,839
- I will die if I go down there. - Jae Seok should go down.

1673
00:55:33,840 --> 00:55:36,524
- They will die. - You could go down.

1674
00:55:36,849 --> 00:55:37,948
It's really big.

1675
00:55:37,949 --> 00:55:40,018
I haven't seen such a big crocodile in Korea.

1676
00:55:40,019 --> 00:55:43,649
For your information, the strongest crocodiles eat first.

1677
00:55:43,650 --> 00:55:44,988
Really?

1678
00:55:44,989 --> 00:55:46,018
Is that one the strongest?

1679
00:55:46,019 --> 00:55:48,058
- That's right. - It's the leader.

1680
00:55:48,059 --> 00:55:49,259
(The strongest crocodile moves first when dinner is ready.)

1681
00:55:49,260 --> 00:55:50,658
- We need... - Take a selfie.

1682
00:55:50,659 --> 00:55:52,658
to feed Minky to complete the mission, right?

1683
00:55:52,659 --> 00:55:53,729
- Yes. - Is this one Minky?

1684
00:55:53,730 --> 00:55:54,859
Which one is Minky?

1685
00:55:54,860 --> 00:55:56,828
- This one must be Minky. - The largest one is Minky.

1686
00:55:56,829 --> 00:55:58,569
- This one must be Minky. - This one must be Minky.

1687
00:55:58,570 --> 00:55:59,645
Like this.

1688
00:55:59,670 --> 00:56:01,145
Make sure the crocodile is in the frame.

1689
00:56:01,269 --> 00:56:02,299
(The selfie needs to contain the member's face and Minky.)

1690
00:56:02,300 --> 00:56:04,738
- Can you get it in the frame? - No, it's too low.

1691
00:56:04,739 --> 00:56:08,979
So Min, you should get on the floor.

1692
00:56:08,980 --> 00:56:10,078
- Do you know what I mean? - Yes.

1693
00:56:10,079 --> 00:56:11,884
Use whatever you can.

1694
00:56:12,409 --> 00:56:14,895
(So Min gets into position for the mission.)

1695
00:56:15,349 --> 00:56:17,165
There you go.

1696
00:56:17,849 --> 00:56:19,348
Hold on. Where is it?

1697
00:56:19,349 --> 00:56:21,895
- It's coming. - I will do it.

1698
00:56:22,559 --> 00:56:23,765
All right.

1699
00:56:24,630 --> 00:56:25,828
Get ready.

1700
00:56:25,829 --> 00:56:26,999
- So Min! So Min! - Move it.

1701
00:56:27,000 --> 00:56:28,935
You have to take it now. So Min, did you take a selfie?

1702
00:56:29,030 --> 00:56:30,399
- So Min! So Min! - Move it.

1703
00:56:30,400 --> 00:56:31,499
- It's coming. - You have to take it now.

1704
00:56:31,500 --> 00:56:33,745
(It finishes eating in an instant.)

1705
00:56:34,139 --> 00:56:36,038
(So Min took selfies when the strongest crocodile came near.)

1706
00:56:36,039 --> 00:56:39,439
Jae Seok. I got only a fraction of my face.

1707
00:56:39,440 --> 00:56:41,178
- It's a selfie. - It's only a fraction of my face.

1708
00:56:41,179 --> 00:56:43,249
- It's still a selfie. - Did you take a selfie?

1709
00:56:43,250 --> 00:56:45,848
That crocodile isn't Minky.

1710
00:56:45,849 --> 00:56:47,178
No?

1711
00:56:47,179 --> 00:56:49,325
(That crocodile isn't Minky?)

1712
00:56:49,349 --> 00:56:50,919
Which crocodile is Minky?

1713
00:56:50,920 --> 00:56:51,919
Isn't it that one?

1714
00:56:51,920 --> 00:56:53,149
Excuse me.

1715
00:56:53,150 --> 00:56:54,634
- What? - Excuse me.

1716
00:56:54,760 --> 00:56:56,259
Would you please get Minky?

1717
00:56:56,260 --> 00:56:58,734
Can you please get Minky?

1718
00:56:58,760 --> 00:57:00,274
- Hey. - Where is Minky?

1719
00:57:00,929 --> 00:57:04,098
Minky is the third strongest crocodile with a white face.

1720
00:57:04,099 --> 00:57:06,044
The third strongest crocodile with a white face.

1721
00:57:06,739 --> 00:57:08,968
- Is it this one? - It has a white face.

1722
00:57:08,969 --> 00:57:10,908
- It's this one. - Look at its eyes.

1723
00:57:10,909 --> 00:57:12,468
- So Min, take a selfie. - Get ready.

1724
00:57:12,469 --> 00:57:14,109
- Take a selfie with Minky. - Here I go.

1725
00:57:14,110 --> 00:57:15,279
Where is the chicken?

1726
00:57:15,280 --> 00:57:17,448
- Here we go. - Where is the chicken? Hold on.

1727
00:57:17,449 --> 00:57:18,448
Where is the chicken?

1728
00:57:18,449 --> 00:57:19,948
- Here we go. - So Min. So Min.

1729
00:57:19,949 --> 00:57:22,018
- Okay. - So Min, come here.

1730
00:57:22,019 --> 00:57:23,018
(It misses.)

1731
00:57:23,019 --> 00:57:25,249
- Come here. - I am ready. Do it one more time.

1732
00:57:25,250 --> 00:57:26,759
Minky, one more time.

1733
00:57:26,760 --> 00:57:28,089
- Minky. - I almost got it.

1734
00:57:28,090 --> 00:57:29,718
Film a video and take a screenshot.

1735
00:57:29,719 --> 00:57:30,888
- Hold on. - Minky, Minky.

1736
00:57:30,889 --> 00:57:32,729
- Don't fight. - It's another crocodile.

1737
00:57:32,730 --> 00:57:34,335
(Another crocodile approaches.)

1738
00:57:34,860 --> 00:57:37,268
- Where is the chicken? - Here is another one.

1739
00:57:37,269 --> 00:57:39,029
(Crocodiles eat in the order of the ranks.)

1740
00:57:39,030 --> 00:57:40,169
So Min.

1741
00:57:40,170 --> 00:57:42,038
- Jae Seok. - Minky, why are you so timid?

1742
00:57:42,039 --> 00:57:43,274
(The second strongest approaches when Minky tries to eat.)

1743
00:57:44,039 --> 00:57:49,238
(Top strongest is after the chicken because it's still hungry.)

1744
00:57:49,239 --> 00:57:51,585
- Jae Seok. - Minky, why are you so timid?

1745
00:57:51,650 --> 00:57:54,448
- There are larger crocodiles. - It's below the rank.

1746
00:57:54,449 --> 00:57:57,294
- It's intimidated. - But Minky needs to eat.

1747
00:57:57,750 --> 00:57:58,848
Minky.

1748
00:57:58,849 --> 00:57:59,924
(It only smacks its lips.)

1749
00:58:01,719 --> 00:58:05,359
(Minky is surrounded by the 2 strongest crocodiles.)

1750
00:58:05,360 --> 00:58:08,634
(Will they be able to capture its mealtime?)

1751
00:58:08,730 --> 00:58:10,029
It's opening its mouth.

1752
00:58:10,030 --> 00:58:11,499
- That one is opening its mouth. - Where is it?

1753
00:58:11,500 --> 00:58:12,768
The strongest crocodile is opening its mouth.

1754
00:58:12,769 --> 00:58:14,868
Minky. Minky needs to eat.

1755
00:58:14,869 --> 00:58:15,899
Put it against its nose.

1756
00:58:15,900 --> 00:58:19,009
- Because of the strongest one, - The strongest crocodile.

1757
00:58:19,010 --> 00:58:20,339
It won't eat with the other one there.

1758
00:58:20,340 --> 00:58:22,754
It can't eat because of the strongest one.

1759
00:58:23,010 --> 00:58:24,109
What should we do?

1760
00:58:24,110 --> 00:58:26,848
Lure the strongest one over here.

1761
00:58:26,849 --> 00:58:28,348
- Okay. - It will eat.

1762
00:58:28,349 --> 00:58:29,919
- No, no. - Hold on.

1763
00:58:29,920 --> 00:58:33,765
What will we do if it gets annoyed and breaks the bridge?

1764
00:58:34,260 --> 00:58:35,594
What will we do if it gets annoyed and breaks the bridge?

1765
00:58:37,230 --> 00:58:39,359
(He is such a coward.)

1766
00:58:39,360 --> 00:58:40,828
Hold on. Minky, Minky.

1767
00:58:40,829 --> 00:58:42,535
- Minky, Minky. - Minky will eat.

1768
00:58:43,159 --> 00:58:45,029
- Minky, Minky. - Minky will eat.

1769
00:58:45,030 --> 00:58:46,029
(Eating)

1770
00:58:46,030 --> 00:58:47,399
That's it. Did you take a selfie?

1771
00:58:47,400 --> 00:58:51,444
(Minky eats when the 2 strongest seem uninterested.)

1772
00:58:51,909 --> 00:58:53,979
That's it. Did you take a selfie?

1773
00:58:53,980 --> 00:58:57,348
- Did you take a selfie? - Minky ate.

1774
00:58:57,349 --> 00:59:00,524
(So Min took selfies at that moment.)

1775
00:59:01,280 --> 00:59:02,379
(So Min and Minky should be in it.)

1776
00:59:02,380 --> 00:59:04,749
- Minky ate. - Did you take a selfie?

1777
00:59:04,750 --> 00:59:06,249
- Did you take it? Minky ate. - I took it.

1778
00:59:06,250 --> 00:59:07,658
You took it. Let's see it.

1779
00:59:07,659 --> 00:59:09,189
- You did it. - Minky ate.

1780
00:59:09,190 --> 00:59:10,488
Let's check the selfie.

1781
00:59:10,489 --> 00:59:12,759
My goodness. Minky.

1782
00:59:12,760 --> 00:59:13,859
(Did So Min manage to take a selfie?)

1783
00:59:13,860 --> 00:59:15,558
You can look from here.

1784
00:59:15,559 --> 00:59:17,875
- I am sweating. - Me too.

1785
00:59:18,099 --> 00:59:20,145
Why does this one look different?

1786
00:59:21,269 --> 00:59:23,468
(Minky is in the selfie.)

1787
00:59:23,469 --> 00:59:24,908
We will accept this selfie.

1788
00:59:24,909 --> 00:59:26,169
Okay! Thank you.

1789
00:59:26,170 --> 00:59:27,585
It looks very satisfied.

1790
00:59:27,610 --> 00:59:28,984
It's satisfied.

1791
00:59:29,039 --> 00:59:31,484
Take a photo of it in its satisfied state.

1792
00:59:31,550 --> 00:59:35,125
(Feed Minky and take a selfie with satisfied Minky is cleared.)

1793
00:59:35,349 --> 00:59:36,864
Come this way.

1794
00:59:36,889 --> 00:59:39,549
What are they doing? They look cute.

1795
00:59:39,550 --> 00:59:41,435
Everyone, this is our last hurdle.

1796
00:59:41,690 --> 00:59:44,765
You'll be cleaning Jollang and Baram's cage.

1797
00:59:44,789 --> 00:59:47,575
Jollang is a llama, and Baram is a red kangaroo.

1798
00:59:47,699 --> 00:59:48,935
Kangaroo?

1799
00:59:49,329 --> 00:59:50,598
You have to clean their cage.

1800
00:59:50,599 --> 00:59:52,705
We have to clean both of their cages.

1801
00:59:52,769 --> 00:59:55,415
(Jollang and Baram)

1802
00:59:55,469 --> 00:59:59,114
It looks like you, Jae Seok.

1803
00:59:59,369 --> 01:00:00,915
- That llama. - It's Jae Seok.

1804
01:00:01,139 --> 01:00:02,779
It looks exactly like you.

1805
01:00:02,780 --> 01:00:04,785
- Jae Seok. - It looks exactly like you.

1806
01:00:04,880 --> 01:00:07,094
(An exact copy)

1807
01:00:07,480 --> 01:00:08,718
(Isn't it a doppelganger?)

1808
01:00:08,719 --> 01:00:10,118
They look the same.

1809
01:00:10,119 --> 01:00:11,919
(They're so similar that everyone is flustered.)

1810
01:00:11,920 --> 01:00:13,024
I was startled.

1811
01:00:13,289 --> 01:00:15,864
I thought you were cleaning inside the cage.

1812
01:00:15,960 --> 01:00:17,564
Take off your glasses, Jae Seok.

1813
01:00:18,130 --> 01:00:19,888
- Hey, what makes it... - They're the same.

1814
01:00:19,889 --> 01:00:21,404
- look like me? - You look the same.

1815
01:00:21,730 --> 01:00:24,698
(They look the same.)

1816
01:00:24,699 --> 01:00:26,575
What makes it look like me?

1817
01:00:26,739 --> 01:00:28,444
They look the same.

1818
01:00:29,000 --> 01:00:30,444
It's looking at you because you look the same.

1819
01:00:31,170 --> 01:00:33,009
- It's angry. - Hey.

1820
01:00:33,010 --> 01:00:35,585
It's upset too.

1821
01:00:35,610 --> 01:00:36,955
Is the llama upset?

1822
01:00:37,079 --> 01:00:39,984
You have to clean quickly so that he can be fed.

1823
01:00:40,579 --> 01:00:42,149
We have to clean quickly so that he can eat.

1824
01:00:42,150 --> 01:00:44,524
- You have to clean now. - Clean now.

1825
01:00:44,590 --> 01:00:46,988
- Where do we go? - You may come in this way.

1826
01:00:46,989 --> 01:00:48,594
It's not dangerous, is it?

1827
01:00:48,690 --> 01:00:50,828
They could kick you with their hind leg.

1828
01:00:50,829 --> 01:00:52,029
(Do they kick with their hind leg?)

1829
01:00:52,030 --> 01:00:53,504
- Pardon? - They can kick with their hind leg.

1830
01:00:53,599 --> 01:00:55,004
Then I can't do this.

1831
01:00:55,760 --> 01:00:56,999
Be careful.

1832
01:00:57,000 --> 01:00:59,645
If you aren't careful, they might kick you.

1833
01:00:59,829 --> 01:01:01,714
It will hurt if they kick me.

1834
01:01:03,639 --> 01:01:04,844
They're coming.

1835
01:01:05,469 --> 01:01:06,609
They're coming.

1836
01:01:06,610 --> 01:01:08,009
(Coward brothers get fussy.)

1837
01:01:08,010 --> 01:01:09,178
What do I do?

1838
01:01:09,179 --> 01:01:10,384
He's coming towards me.

1839
01:01:10,409 --> 01:01:13,895
- Sweep their poop with this broom. - Okay.

1840
01:01:13,920 --> 01:01:16,594
Sweep it up and put it here.

1841
01:01:16,650 --> 01:01:18,694
This one is cute. He must be a baby.

1842
01:01:19,019 --> 01:01:21,665
- Yes, he is a baby. - He likes to be touched.

1843
01:01:21,690 --> 01:01:22,794
Goodness.

1844
01:01:23,090 --> 01:01:25,328
I need to feed my family.

1845
01:01:25,329 --> 01:01:27,605
- Jae Seok, you have a big family. - What?

1846
01:01:27,699 --> 01:01:28,729
You have a big family.

1847
01:01:28,730 --> 01:01:30,468
- Jae Seok. - I need to feed my family.

1848
01:01:30,469 --> 01:01:32,705
Instead of taking care of your family, you should eat.

1849
01:01:32,800 --> 01:01:33,899
You should eat.

1850
01:01:33,900 --> 01:01:34,975
(You should eat some grass.)

1851
01:01:35,139 --> 01:01:37,015
You should eat as well.

1852
01:01:37,840 --> 01:01:39,884
Jae Seok, take care of yourself too.

1853
01:01:40,679 --> 01:01:41,839
I'll eat later.

1854
01:01:41,840 --> 01:01:43,515
(I'm the eldest, so I feed my siblings first.)

1855
01:01:44,010 --> 01:01:45,779
(Let's see.)

1856
01:01:45,780 --> 01:01:47,825
Do you know what's funny?

1857
01:01:48,420 --> 01:01:49,995
No one is filming us cleaning.

1858
01:01:51,250 --> 01:01:52,524
We're working.

1859
01:01:53,760 --> 01:01:55,089
We're cleaning.

1860
01:01:55,090 --> 01:01:56,089
(One camera is filming them.)

1861
01:01:56,090 --> 01:01:58,488
(Cleaning is the main mission, so please film us too.)

1862
01:01:58,489 --> 01:01:59,765
We're cleaning.

1863
01:02:00,360 --> 01:02:02,975
- Aren't you satisfied? - Yes, man.

1864
01:02:03,000 --> 01:02:05,029
That's enough. Go to the kangaroo cage.

1865
01:02:05,030 --> 01:02:06,198
We're done here.

1866
01:02:06,199 --> 01:02:08,569
("That's enough"?)

1867
01:02:08,570 --> 01:02:10,015
"That's enough"?

1868
01:02:10,610 --> 01:02:12,169
Come. That's enough.

1869
01:02:12,170 --> 01:02:14,185
- There's nothing more to film. - Listen.

1870
01:02:14,409 --> 01:02:16,415
Are you making us work?

1871
01:02:16,639 --> 01:02:19,149
- I'm disappointed. - Here's what's funny.

1872
01:02:19,150 --> 01:02:21,194
Do you know what the zookeeper said to us?

1873
01:02:21,519 --> 01:02:23,495
"All you're doing here is cleaning."

1874
01:02:24,719 --> 01:02:26,049
- Gosh. - Shouldn't we cover it?

1875
01:02:26,050 --> 01:02:27,194
Do you need my help?

1876
01:02:27,389 --> 01:02:30,335
- All you're doing here is cleaning. - Yes.

1877
01:02:33,630 --> 01:02:35,029
"It's true."

1878
01:02:35,030 --> 01:02:36,734
(They're on Running Man for work.)

1879
01:02:37,469 --> 01:02:39,105
- Do we need to bring it? - Yes.

1880
01:02:39,400 --> 01:02:40,944
Look at him.

1881
01:02:41,639 --> 01:02:43,044
He's like a human being.

1882
01:02:43,139 --> 01:02:45,538
A kangaroo is lying here. You should be filming here.

1883
01:02:45,539 --> 01:02:47,455
- Come here. - A kangaroo is lying.

1884
01:02:47,480 --> 01:02:49,509
A kangaroo is lying down like a human being.

1885
01:02:49,510 --> 01:02:51,249
Why is he lying down like that?

1886
01:02:51,250 --> 01:02:52,749
(Have you never seen a kangaroo lying down?)

1887
01:02:52,750 --> 01:02:54,125
Isn't that posture...

1888
01:02:54,280 --> 01:02:56,495
when we're watching TV at night?

1889
01:02:56,619 --> 01:02:58,325
It's like we lie down on a sofa.

1890
01:02:58,449 --> 01:02:59,589
It looks similar.

1891
01:02:59,590 --> 01:03:00,995
What kind of condition is he in?

1892
01:03:01,019 --> 01:03:02,959
He's very comfortable.

1893
01:03:02,960 --> 01:03:04,029
He's not scared.

1894
01:03:04,030 --> 01:03:05,665
He isn't interested.

1895
01:03:05,760 --> 01:03:07,105
You know what?

1896
01:03:07,300 --> 01:03:10,968
I think he's treating you like slaves.

1897
01:03:10,969 --> 01:03:12,705
- He's the human. - Yes.

1898
01:03:12,730 --> 01:03:14,268
Hurry and clean up.

1899
01:03:14,269 --> 01:03:16,674
- The owner of the house is here. - Right.

1900
01:03:16,940 --> 01:03:18,344
Take a look at them.

1901
01:03:18,409 --> 01:03:19,745
This is interesting.

1902
01:03:20,380 --> 01:03:22,009
You may sit next to him and look.

1903
01:03:22,010 --> 01:03:23,185
He won't attack.

1904
01:03:24,349 --> 01:03:26,808
(He may not attack, but Se Chan is very scared.)

1905
01:03:26,809 --> 01:03:27,955
He's looking at you.

1906
01:03:28,480 --> 01:03:30,288
- May I touch him? - You may gently.

1907
01:03:30,289 --> 01:03:31,424
Don't do it.

1908
01:03:32,119 --> 01:03:33,265
He'll hit you with his tail.

1909
01:03:34,519 --> 01:03:36,288
Gosh, it's very...

1910
01:03:36,289 --> 01:03:37,535
- Is it hard? - It's hard.

1911
01:03:38,489 --> 01:03:41,375
I hope he hits you with his tail but not enough to hurt you.

1912
01:03:42,000 --> 01:03:43,598
(Get hit by his tail?)

1913
01:03:43,599 --> 01:03:44,899
Wouldn't it be funny?

1914
01:03:44,900 --> 01:03:46,544
(That would be funny indeed.)

1915
01:03:49,239 --> 01:03:52,145
(He's bothered, so he moves.)

1916
01:03:52,440 --> 01:03:53,678
(I might get hit at this rate.)

1917
01:03:53,679 --> 01:03:55,114
Okay, let's go.

1918
01:03:55,340 --> 01:03:56,484
Let's go now.

1919
01:03:56,610 --> 01:03:57,779
Thank you.

1920
01:03:57,780 --> 01:04:00,355
- Thank you. - Thank you, zookeeper.

1921
01:04:00,380 --> 01:04:01,495
It was fun.

1922
01:04:01,650 --> 01:04:03,279
Llamas were fun to watch.

1923
01:04:03,280 --> 01:04:05,364
We put our arms on the shoulders. You should do it too.

1924
01:04:05,389 --> 01:04:07,718
Seok Jin gets 3 ballots, and Jae Seok gets 2 ballots.

1925
01:04:07,719 --> 01:04:09,359
The rest of you get one each.

1926
01:04:09,360 --> 01:04:10,788
- Are you satisfied? - It was great.

1927
01:04:10,789 --> 01:04:12,359
I'm very satisfied.

1928
01:04:12,360 --> 01:04:13,935
It was good indeed.

1929
01:04:14,130 --> 01:04:17,029
- Honestly it was good. - Really?

1930
01:04:17,030 --> 01:04:18,729
I wasn't dissatisfied.

1931
01:04:18,730 --> 01:04:19,999
(The host and a person of his choice get 2 penalty badges each.)

1932
01:04:20,000 --> 01:04:22,174
- I'll follow how I feel. - That's what I did too.

1933
01:04:22,369 --> 01:04:25,214
I have three of them.

1934
01:04:25,309 --> 01:04:29,355
How I feel will be influential, won't it?

1935
01:04:30,380 --> 01:04:31,779
(What's the result of the vote?)

1936
01:04:31,780 --> 01:04:34,395
Here's the result of the vote.

1937
01:04:35,280 --> 01:04:36,555
What's the result?

1938
01:04:36,849 --> 01:04:38,495
How many were satisfied?

1939
01:04:39,590 --> 01:04:41,888
All members were satisfied. You won a Korean beef set.

1940
01:04:41,889 --> 01:04:43,535
(All members were satisfied.)

1941
01:04:44,289 --> 01:04:45,828
(Even the host is surprised.)

1942
01:04:45,829 --> 01:04:47,558
- The Korean beef set? - Is it true?

1943
01:04:47,559 --> 01:04:49,335
- Really? - Were you that satisfied?

1944
01:04:49,599 --> 01:04:51,404
I'm very happy.

1945
01:04:51,530 --> 01:04:53,814
All members can be satisfied.

1946
01:04:53,869 --> 01:04:56,768
You were really satisfied, weren't you?

1947
01:04:56,769 --> 01:04:58,868
Here's an exchange card for Korean beef.

1948
01:04:58,869 --> 01:05:00,415
Thank you so much.

1949
01:05:02,010 --> 01:05:04,749
Only the person that Haha picks will...

1950
01:05:04,750 --> 01:05:06,009
get a penalty badge.

1951
01:05:06,010 --> 01:05:08,718
- That person will get one badge. - How many?

1952
01:05:08,719 --> 01:05:09,855
Is it one badge?

1953
01:05:09,880 --> 01:05:12,388
(Kwang Soo has 3, and Seok Jin has 2.)

1954
01:05:12,389 --> 01:05:14,888
(Their situation changes depending on Haha's choice.)

1955
01:05:14,889 --> 01:05:16,165
Seok Jin.

1956
01:05:16,760 --> 01:05:18,504
The mission you gave me was...

1957
01:05:19,230 --> 01:05:20,504
impressive.

1958
01:05:20,800 --> 01:05:22,705
I didn't understand it.

1959
01:05:22,730 --> 01:05:25,129
Let's be fair.

1960
01:05:25,130 --> 01:05:27,114
Ji Seok Jin!

1961
01:05:27,199 --> 01:05:30,038
(Haha chooses Seok Jin.)

1962
01:05:30,039 --> 01:05:31,138
Bring it to me.

1963
01:05:31,139 --> 01:05:32,209
(Seok Jin can't hide his disappointment.)

1964
01:05:32,210 --> 01:05:33,468
You bring it to me.

1965
01:05:33,469 --> 01:05:34,984
This is all about them two.

1966
01:05:35,280 --> 01:05:37,585
Both of them are losing.

1967
01:05:38,909 --> 01:05:40,109
- Is it lobster? - Lobster.

1968
01:05:40,110 --> 01:05:41,955
- We're catching it. Is it easy? - Okay.

1969
01:05:41,980 --> 01:05:44,089
- Are you the host, Se Chan? - Yes.

1970
01:05:44,090 --> 01:05:46,249
- Wait, this time... - Isn't it 1 of the 2?

1971
01:05:46,250 --> 01:05:48,734
- Right now... - Two badges are on the line, right?

1972
01:05:48,889 --> 01:05:51,665
It depends on the result of the vote.

1973
01:05:51,690 --> 01:05:53,634
Let's bet multiple badges.

1974
01:05:54,030 --> 01:05:55,274
Let's bet multiple badges.

1975
01:05:55,360 --> 01:05:57,368
You need to appease me, Seok Jin.

1976
01:05:57,369 --> 01:05:59,428
(I can give you a badge.)

1977
01:05:59,429 --> 01:06:01,669
- He looks upset. - What year did you start...

1978
01:06:01,670 --> 01:06:03,274
- What do you mean? - being a comedian?

1979
01:06:04,570 --> 01:06:05,785
Goodness.

1980
01:06:05,869 --> 01:06:07,984
Jae Seok, what's this?

1981
01:06:08,079 --> 01:06:10,085
He's asking what year I started.

1982
01:06:10,179 --> 01:06:12,078
- Come on. - Seok Jin.

1983
01:06:12,079 --> 01:06:13,149
What year did you start?

1984
01:06:13,150 --> 01:06:14,725
- What year? - Tell us.

1985
01:06:14,750 --> 01:06:16,479
I started in the 10th year at KBS.

1986
01:06:16,480 --> 01:06:17,618
I started in the seventh.

1987
01:06:17,619 --> 01:06:19,018
My goodness.

1988
01:06:19,019 --> 01:06:20,558
- That means... - Seriously.

1989
01:06:20,559 --> 01:06:22,689
- the difference is three years. - He can't even look at you.

1990
01:06:22,690 --> 01:06:23,988
- That's huge. - Yes.

1991
01:06:23,989 --> 01:06:27,229
There's no hierarchy when we're playing games.

1992
01:06:27,230 --> 01:06:30,198
Seok Jin is such a fossil.

1993
01:06:30,199 --> 01:06:31,598
- I hope that... - It's not that.

1994
01:06:31,599 --> 01:06:33,575
Seok Jin will continue acting like this.

1995
01:06:33,670 --> 01:06:34,968
- You don't understand. - I'm serious.

1996
01:06:34,969 --> 01:06:36,339
Who are you afraid of?

1997
01:06:36,340 --> 01:06:37,669
I'll call him.

1998
01:06:37,670 --> 01:06:38,868
It's Jae Seok.

1999
01:06:38,869 --> 01:06:41,279
(It's Jae Seok.)

2000
01:06:41,280 --> 01:06:42,638
(Laughing)

2001
01:06:42,639 --> 01:06:44,325
- What's wrong? - Se Chan is afraid of me.

2002
01:06:44,480 --> 01:06:46,578
- Call him. - Se Chan is afraid of me.

2003
01:06:46,579 --> 01:06:47,948
Call him.

2004
01:06:47,949 --> 01:06:49,955
- There's no reason not to do it. - Show us.

2005
01:06:50,079 --> 01:06:51,495
Call him.

2006
01:06:51,619 --> 01:06:53,959
- He's calling him. - I'm curious.

2007
01:06:53,960 --> 01:06:55,265
- He's calling. - I got a call.

2008
01:06:55,889 --> 01:06:57,705
- He's picking up. - Wait.

2009
01:06:57,760 --> 01:06:59,004
I'm at a shoot, so hang up.

2010
01:06:59,989 --> 01:07:01,404
(Hanging up)

2011
01:07:01,800 --> 01:07:04,399
(Jae Seok who's three years ahead acts firmly.)

2012
01:07:04,400 --> 01:07:05,499
(Unbelievable)

2013
01:07:05,500 --> 01:07:07,415
- What did he say? - Why did you hang up already?

2014
01:07:07,900 --> 01:07:09,544
- What did he say? - He told me he's busy.

2015
01:07:09,739 --> 01:07:10,868
He's at work.

2016
01:07:10,869 --> 01:07:12,238
- I see. - Really?

2017
01:07:12,239 --> 01:07:13,308
(They head to Se Chan's vacation activity.)

2018
01:07:13,309 --> 01:07:14,714
- Seriously. - It's not that.

2019
01:07:14,739 --> 01:07:16,439
Host, I think we're here.

2020
01:07:16,440 --> 01:07:17,509
Yes, we're here.

2021
01:07:17,510 --> 01:07:19,185
- Is this it? - Yes.

2022
01:07:19,280 --> 01:07:20,924
All right, everyone.

2023
01:07:21,150 --> 01:07:23,424
Get ready to catch lobster.

2024
01:07:23,780 --> 01:07:25,089
Are there lobsters here?

2025
01:07:25,090 --> 01:07:26,689
(Are there lobsters here?)

2026
01:07:26,690 --> 01:07:28,359
This is the last activity of the Vacation Race.

2027
01:07:28,360 --> 01:07:30,959
You arrived at "Date with the Stars" spot hosted by Se Chan.

2028
01:07:30,960 --> 01:07:32,388
Host Se Chan will get out first.

2029
01:07:32,389 --> 01:07:34,404
- Okay. - That was it.

2030
01:07:35,159 --> 01:07:37,268
(For the hidden mission to be announced, Se Chan leaves.)

2031
01:07:37,269 --> 01:07:38,504
All right.

2032
01:07:38,530 --> 01:07:40,698
(What's the hidden mission this time?)

2033
01:07:40,699 --> 01:07:42,975
- Here's the last hidden mission. - Yes?

2034
01:07:44,110 --> 01:07:47,285
Take a very closeup photo of a part of the host's body.

2035
01:07:47,309 --> 01:07:49,078
- What? - Take a photo?

2036
01:07:49,079 --> 01:07:50,578
It can be his eye or his ear.

2037
01:07:50,579 --> 01:07:52,479
It can also be a closeup photo of his finger.

2038
01:07:52,480 --> 01:07:54,218
We can take a photo like we're playing.

2039
01:07:54,219 --> 01:07:56,578
If you show me a closeup photo of his body,

2040
01:07:56,579 --> 01:07:58,249
you'll get an additional vote.

2041
01:07:58,250 --> 01:08:00,419
- The more we take, the better. - Two parts can be...

2042
01:08:00,420 --> 01:08:02,194
Listen, Kwang Soo.

2043
01:08:02,690 --> 01:08:04,864
Is there a way that someone else can be penalized?

2044
01:08:05,559 --> 01:08:06,805
No.

2045
01:08:07,360 --> 01:08:09,129
- Is it over? - It's true.

2046
01:08:09,130 --> 01:08:11,129
- Is it over? - I thought about it on our way.

2047
01:08:11,130 --> 01:08:12,645
- Is it over? - I'm on your side.

2048
01:08:12,969 --> 01:08:14,939
Let's go, let's go.

2049
01:08:14,940 --> 01:08:16,075
Okay.

2050
01:08:16,199 --> 01:08:17,569
- Okay. - Let's go.

2051
01:08:17,570 --> 01:08:19,384
(They are off to fish for lobster.)

2052
01:08:19,969 --> 01:08:21,384
It's nice that it's inside.

2053
01:08:22,940 --> 01:08:24,524
Come this way.

2054
01:08:24,579 --> 01:08:26,349
Do you see the lobsters on the bottom?

2055
01:08:26,350 --> 01:08:28,019
This is how it's set.

2056
01:08:28,020 --> 01:08:29,578
It looks fun.

2057
01:08:29,579 --> 01:08:31,095
There they are.

2058
01:08:31,989 --> 01:08:34,219
You'll fish for exactly 30 minutes.

2059
01:08:34,220 --> 01:08:36,259
It's over once you eat ramyeon at the sashimi restaurant.

2060
01:08:36,260 --> 01:08:37,429
(They plan to eat the lobster that they catch.)

2061
01:08:37,430 --> 01:08:41,404
The one who catches the least number of lobsters gets a penalty badge.

2062
01:08:41,430 --> 01:08:43,875
I'm not good with lobsters.

2063
01:08:45,000 --> 01:08:46,198
Hello.

2064
01:08:46,199 --> 01:08:47,814
Hello to you too.

2065
01:08:48,000 --> 01:08:49,898
- Hello. - Hello, sir.

2066
01:08:49,899 --> 01:08:51,209
- Hello. - Hello.

2067
01:08:51,210 --> 01:08:52,339
What should we do?

2068
01:08:52,340 --> 01:08:54,038
(How do we catch lobsters?)

2069
01:08:54,039 --> 01:08:56,255
- There's a hook right here. - Yes.

2070
01:08:56,310 --> 01:08:58,778
- Take it out like this. - I took it out.

2071
01:08:58,779 --> 01:09:00,285
Then turn it.

2072
01:09:01,020 --> 01:09:03,224
There's bait in front of you.

2073
01:09:03,449 --> 01:09:05,364
The bait is shrimp.

2074
01:09:06,189 --> 01:09:08,389
Take a shrimp and...

2075
01:09:08,390 --> 01:09:10,864
- Shall I bait it? - Yes, bait the hook.

2076
01:09:11,229 --> 01:09:12,889
Bait it the way you want.

2077
01:09:12,890 --> 01:09:14,175
(Everyone is concentrating.)

2078
01:09:15,159 --> 01:09:16,774
Hook it gently.

2079
01:09:17,569 --> 01:09:19,375
Sir, can we eat these lobsters?

2080
01:09:19,800 --> 01:09:21,715
Yes, you can.

2081
01:09:22,000 --> 01:09:24,144
- Then? - After you do that, cast it.

2082
01:09:24,739 --> 01:09:26,769
(Kwang Soo sees it.)

2083
01:09:26,770 --> 01:09:29,614
(He takes a closeup photo of Se Chan's sideburns.)

2084
01:09:29,880 --> 01:09:31,379
- Cast it out. - Yes.

2085
01:09:31,380 --> 01:09:32,549
I see fish too.

2086
01:09:32,550 --> 01:09:35,249
Untie it. When you look right in front of you...

2087
01:09:35,250 --> 01:09:37,648
(She takes a closeup photo of his ear.)

2088
01:09:37,649 --> 01:09:40,095
Hook it in front of you.

2089
01:09:40,590 --> 01:09:42,519
(She takes a closeup photo of the back of his neck.)

2090
01:09:42,520 --> 01:09:44,635
He has no idea we're taking photos of him.

2091
01:09:45,229 --> 01:09:47,028
He's just stupid.

2092
01:09:47,029 --> 01:09:49,575
- He's immersed in the fishing. - Right.

2093
01:09:50,100 --> 01:09:52,328
- After doing it... - Then cast it.

2094
01:09:52,329 --> 01:09:54,545
(They start lobster fishing.)

2095
01:09:55,470 --> 01:09:57,114
- Cast it out. - Okay.

2096
01:09:57,270 --> 01:09:59,585
- Cast it directly. - Is that it?

2097
01:10:01,109 --> 01:10:03,054
I got something.

2098
01:10:05,279 --> 01:10:06,578
(The float is being dragged.)

2099
01:10:06,579 --> 01:10:08,549
- I caught something. What do I do? - You got something.

2100
01:10:08,550 --> 01:10:10,394
- Did you catch something? - I got something.

2101
01:10:11,289 --> 01:10:12,389
(Tight)

2102
01:10:12,390 --> 01:10:13,919
- What should I do? - Seok Jin caught something.

2103
01:10:13,920 --> 01:10:15,858
- You have to catch it. - You can go back.

2104
01:10:15,859 --> 01:10:17,459
Seok Jin caught something.

2105
01:10:17,460 --> 01:10:19,089
- It didn't go in. - He caught a fish.

2106
01:10:19,090 --> 01:10:21,129
- He caught a fish. - Pull it. Pull it in.

2107
01:10:21,130 --> 01:10:22,299
- Bring it up. - I got something.

2108
01:10:22,300 --> 01:10:24,299
- What should I do? - He caught a fish.

2109
01:10:24,300 --> 01:10:25,568
- He caught it. - He caught a fish.

2110
01:10:25,569 --> 01:10:26,675
I caught a fish.

2111
01:10:26,869 --> 01:10:28,299
You caught a fish?

2112
01:10:28,300 --> 01:10:29,398
(Aren't they supposed to be lobsters?)

2113
01:10:29,399 --> 01:10:31,545
You caught 1 of the 2 rockfish in there.

2114
01:10:32,239 --> 01:10:33,738
(He caught 1 of the 2 rockfish.)

2115
01:10:33,739 --> 01:10:35,509
Only lobsters count.

2116
01:10:35,510 --> 01:10:37,984
(Only lobsters are accepted.)

2117
01:10:39,949 --> 01:10:41,054
I caught something.

2118
01:10:41,149 --> 01:10:42,524
Who caught something?

2119
01:10:43,020 --> 01:10:45,488
(The lobster looks at Jong Kook's bait.)

2120
01:10:45,489 --> 01:10:48,064
(It falls for it.)

2121
01:10:48,659 --> 01:10:49,988
He caught a lobster.

2122
01:10:49,989 --> 01:10:51,434
Jong Kook caught one already?

2123
01:10:51,460 --> 01:10:53,064
Lobster.

2124
01:10:53,659 --> 01:10:54,959
Jong Kook got one?

2125
01:10:54,960 --> 01:10:56,535
- Who was it? - It's so big.

2126
01:10:56,899 --> 01:10:58,099
You got a big one.

2127
01:10:58,100 --> 01:10:59,198
It was Jong Kook.

2128
01:10:59,199 --> 01:11:00,814
(Jong Kook is the first to show off his skills.)

2129
01:11:02,069 --> 01:11:04,408
- It's fun catching them. - I caught one.

2130
01:11:04,409 --> 01:11:05,545
Wait.

2131
01:11:07,069 --> 01:11:08,408
(It goes up along with Seok Jin's rising hand.)

2132
01:11:08,409 --> 01:11:09,509
I caught one.

2133
01:11:09,510 --> 01:11:11,255
(It goes up along with Seok Jin's rising hand.)

2134
01:11:11,510 --> 01:11:12,825
- Seok Jin. - I caught one.

2135
01:11:13,380 --> 01:11:14,995
You hooked its tail.

2136
01:11:15,579 --> 01:11:17,788
- I got one, thank you. - Be careful or you'll lose it.

2137
01:11:17,789 --> 01:11:18,965
Okay.

2138
01:11:21,090 --> 01:11:22,459
I caught one too.

2139
01:11:22,460 --> 01:11:23,488
(He gets a lobster after Jong Kook.)

2140
01:11:23,489 --> 01:11:24,665
It's a big one.

2141
01:11:25,430 --> 01:11:27,089
(Seok Jin shows off his fishing skills.)

2142
01:11:27,090 --> 01:11:28,259
I'm in trouble.

2143
01:11:28,260 --> 01:11:29,875
They actually bite.

2144
01:11:31,529 --> 01:11:33,005
Please eat it.

2145
01:11:34,140 --> 01:11:37,568
(The float gets dragged.)

2146
01:11:37,569 --> 01:11:38,669
Please take the bait.

2147
01:11:38,670 --> 01:11:39,738
(It stops.)

2148
01:11:39,739 --> 01:11:41,179
It bit it now.

2149
01:11:41,180 --> 01:11:42,278
- Is it right now? - Yes.

2150
01:11:42,279 --> 01:11:43,778
Raise it.

2151
01:11:43,779 --> 01:11:44,854
(Raise your rod.)

2152
01:11:45,250 --> 01:11:47,325
You got it.

2153
01:11:48,449 --> 01:11:51,264
(Let's go, Ji Hyo.)

2154
01:11:52,350 --> 01:11:53,425
(Dropping)

2155
01:11:55,020 --> 01:11:56,734
(What?)

2156
01:11:57,729 --> 01:11:59,429
(Kwang Soo picks up the lobster.)

2157
01:11:59,430 --> 01:12:01,129
Ji Hyo, I caught it.

2158
01:12:01,130 --> 01:12:05,375
- Hey, how can you steal mine? - Hey.

2159
01:12:05,600 --> 01:12:08,068
You can't steal mine.

2160
01:12:08,069 --> 01:12:09,839
Kwang Soo, you can't do that.

2161
01:12:09,840 --> 01:12:11,769
- Pardon? I didn't steal. - Isn't it mine?

2162
01:12:11,770 --> 01:12:12,885
I didn't steal it.

2163
01:12:12,970 --> 01:12:15,285
I caught it when it was falling.

2164
01:12:15,439 --> 01:12:17,114
Kwang Soo, that's wrong.

2165
01:12:17,279 --> 01:12:19,425
You can't steal mine.

2166
01:12:20,149 --> 01:12:22,049
You can't do that. Give it back to Ji Hyo.

2167
01:12:22,050 --> 01:12:24,154
I'm telling the truth.

2168
01:12:24,949 --> 01:12:26,618
(12 minutes pass.)

2169
01:12:26,619 --> 01:12:28,019
How many did you catch?

2170
01:12:28,020 --> 01:12:29,335
I caught one.

2171
01:12:29,560 --> 01:12:30,788
I caught one.

2172
01:12:30,789 --> 01:12:31,788
(He catches his third one.)

2173
01:12:31,789 --> 01:12:33,064
Bring the net.

2174
01:12:33,159 --> 01:12:34,898
- Here you go. - Okay, help me with this.

2175
01:12:34,899 --> 01:12:36,575
Give me the landing net.

2176
01:12:37,699 --> 01:12:39,604
(He pushes down the landing net.)

2177
01:12:39,899 --> 01:12:41,938
(Surprised)

2178
01:12:41,939 --> 01:12:43,014
Hey.

2179
01:12:43,140 --> 01:12:44,868
(He presses it down with the landing net.)

2180
01:12:44,869 --> 01:12:45,868
(He releases the lobster.)

2181
01:12:45,869 --> 01:12:46,908
It fell off.

2182
01:12:46,909 --> 01:12:49,179
(Don't get caught by Seok Jin.)

2183
01:12:49,180 --> 01:12:50,238
Did you do it on purpose?

2184
01:12:50,239 --> 01:12:52,448
- I didn't know. - I think you pushed it down.

2185
01:12:52,449 --> 01:12:53,509
No, I didn't.

2186
01:12:53,510 --> 01:12:55,478
- I almost had it. - I didn't know.

2187
01:12:55,479 --> 01:12:56,519
(Kwang Soo is impressive.)

2188
01:12:56,520 --> 01:12:57,988
It was a mistake, Seok Jin.

2189
01:12:57,989 --> 01:13:00,325
- You pushed it. - No.

2190
01:13:00,420 --> 01:13:01,835
I got distracted.

2191
01:13:02,319 --> 01:13:04,019
- I'm sorry. - Did you see him push it?

2192
01:13:04,020 --> 01:13:05,734
Why you...

2193
01:13:05,960 --> 01:13:08,474
He pushed down the lobster.

2194
01:13:09,329 --> 01:13:10,835
You have 10 minutes left.

2195
01:13:11,470 --> 01:13:13,228
I haven't caught one yet.

2196
01:13:13,229 --> 01:13:15,944
Everyone next to me is catching them so easily.

2197
01:13:17,539 --> 01:13:18,769
I got one.

2198
01:13:18,770 --> 01:13:20,568
- How did you catch it? - Did you get it, So Min?

2199
01:13:20,569 --> 01:13:21,684
Yes.

2200
01:13:21,739 --> 01:13:22,778
I caught one.

2201
01:13:22,779 --> 01:13:25,654
(So Min catches one lobster.)

2202
01:13:26,409 --> 01:13:28,879
I got it, I got it.

2203
01:13:28,880 --> 01:13:30,549
Give me the landing net now.

2204
01:13:30,550 --> 01:13:32,694
- I caught one. - Okay.

2205
01:13:32,890 --> 01:13:34,264
One lobster.

2206
01:13:35,489 --> 01:13:36,618
I caught one.

2207
01:13:36,619 --> 01:13:38,288
(Se Chan and Kwang Soo catch one each.)

2208
01:13:38,289 --> 01:13:39,564
I caught one.

2209
01:13:39,789 --> 01:13:41,175
Please come.

2210
01:13:41,329 --> 01:13:42,559
Come just once.

2211
01:13:42,560 --> 01:13:43,705
(Only Jae Seok hasn't caught one yet.)

2212
01:13:44,159 --> 01:13:46,404
Star, please eat one.

2213
01:13:48,000 --> 01:13:49,745
You have 20 seconds.

2214
01:13:50,640 --> 01:13:52,415
Okay, I caught it.

2215
01:13:52,640 --> 01:13:56,255
(He catches a lobster dramatically.)

2216
01:13:57,510 --> 01:13:59,054
It's a big one.

2217
01:13:59,380 --> 01:14:00,379
(Time is running out.)

2218
01:14:00,380 --> 01:14:01,495
10.

2219
01:14:02,079 --> 01:14:03,148
Nine.

2220
01:14:03,149 --> 01:14:04,148
(Will Jae Seok catch a lobster?)

2221
01:14:04,149 --> 01:14:05,364
Eight.

2222
01:14:05,819 --> 01:14:06,818
Seven.

2223
01:14:06,819 --> 01:14:08,694
(It falls off.)

2224
01:14:10,930 --> 01:14:13,064
(The lobster is free.)

2225
01:14:13,529 --> 01:14:16,434
(Swinging)

2226
01:14:16,460 --> 01:14:17,629
Time is up.

2227
01:14:17,630 --> 01:14:18,828
Do they not like the shrimp?

2228
01:14:18,829 --> 01:14:21,944
Jae Seok will get a penalty badge.

2229
01:14:22,039 --> 01:14:23,339
- Isn't it fun? - Yes.

2230
01:14:23,340 --> 01:14:25,068
- This is my first time. - It's so much fun.

2231
01:14:25,069 --> 01:14:26,209
It was good.

2232
01:14:26,210 --> 01:14:29,478
- Let's go and taste it. - Okay.

2233
01:14:29,479 --> 01:14:30,785
Let's eat.

2234
01:14:31,310 --> 01:14:33,455
Is it sashimi? Can you eat it raw?

2235
01:14:33,750 --> 01:14:35,179
It's amazing.

2236
01:14:35,180 --> 01:14:36,948
(Freshly caught lobsters are eaten raw and steamed.)

2237
01:14:36,949 --> 01:14:39,249
Thank you. I'll try some lobster ramyeon.

2238
01:14:39,250 --> 01:14:42,118
(Slurping lobster ramyeon)

2239
01:14:42,119 --> 01:14:43,394
Enjoy it.

2240
01:14:43,489 --> 01:14:45,104
It's so plump.

2241
01:14:46,529 --> 01:14:48,398
(Everyone is busy eating.)

2242
01:14:48,399 --> 01:14:49,535
Here you go.

2243
01:14:49,560 --> 01:14:50,804
Open up.

2244
01:14:51,369 --> 01:14:53,205
Why are you doing this to me?

2245
01:14:53,270 --> 01:14:54,639
It's to flatter me.

2246
01:14:54,640 --> 01:14:56,415
Please film this.

2247
01:14:56,939 --> 01:14:58,745
- Eat a lot. - I'm eating.

2248
01:15:00,210 --> 01:15:01,854
Kwang Soo is bringing kimchi.

2249
01:15:02,140 --> 01:15:03,339
That's attentive.

2250
01:15:03,340 --> 01:15:04,948
- What? - It's attentive.

2251
01:15:04,949 --> 01:15:06,448
What kind of service is this?

2252
01:15:06,449 --> 01:15:07,448
That's impressive.

2253
01:15:07,449 --> 01:15:09,049
This kimchi is better than that.

2254
01:15:09,050 --> 01:15:10,049
(He keeps things in check.)

2255
01:15:10,050 --> 01:15:11,194
Try it.

2256
01:15:12,619 --> 01:15:14,264
- What are you doing? - There are flies.

2257
01:15:14,720 --> 01:15:16,795
Thank you. I'll remember it.

2258
01:15:17,060 --> 01:15:18,559
- I'll remember it. - It's okay.

2259
01:15:18,560 --> 01:15:20,135
(I like doing it.)

2260
01:15:22,600 --> 01:15:23,858
I'll take a photo of Se Chan eating.

2261
01:15:23,859 --> 01:15:24,944
What?

2262
01:15:25,829 --> 01:15:27,205
Se Chan is cute.

2263
01:15:29,539 --> 01:15:31,309
Open your mouth. Show that you're enjoying it.

2264
01:15:31,310 --> 01:15:32,444
(Haha attempts at the hidden mission.)

2265
01:15:32,840 --> 01:15:35,339
(Haha obtains an additional vote.)

2266
01:15:35,340 --> 01:15:38,049
He's eating lobster in a cute way.

2267
01:15:38,050 --> 01:15:39,179
(Is he blatantly taking photos of him?)

2268
01:15:39,180 --> 01:15:40,385
It'll be an unforgettable memory.

2269
01:15:43,119 --> 01:15:44,549
Let me take a photo of your ugly face.

2270
01:15:44,550 --> 01:15:45,995
(Approaching)

2271
01:15:46,189 --> 01:15:47,249
(I'm not that blunt.)

2272
01:15:47,250 --> 01:15:48,858
- Is this... - Your ugly looks.

2273
01:15:48,859 --> 01:15:50,564
the hidden mission?

2274
01:15:50,960 --> 01:15:53,059
- Is it the mission? - You're making it obvious.

2275
01:15:53,060 --> 01:15:54,335
Let me take a photo of you.

2276
01:15:54,430 --> 01:15:56,759
- This must be the mission. - No.

2277
01:15:56,760 --> 01:15:58,444
- Do it. - Okay.

2278
01:15:58,470 --> 01:16:02,038
Today's Vacation Race is over.

2279
01:16:02,039 --> 01:16:03,144
("Date with the Stars" activity ends.)

2280
01:16:03,670 --> 01:16:06,108
Here's the current number of votes that you obtained.

2281
01:16:06,109 --> 01:16:08,978
So Min succeeded 4 times, so she has a total of 5 votes.

2282
01:16:08,979 --> 01:16:11,448
Ji Hyo and Haha succeeded 3 times, so they have a total of 4 votes.

2283
01:16:11,449 --> 01:16:13,509
Jae Seok has a total of three votes.

2284
01:16:13,510 --> 01:16:16,448
Kwang Soo and Jong Kook have two votes each.

2285
01:16:16,449 --> 01:16:17,925
Seok Jin has one.

2286
01:16:18,020 --> 01:16:19,165
What?

2287
01:16:19,689 --> 01:16:21,864
(What's going on?)

2288
01:16:22,159 --> 01:16:23,734
Do I have to send it to him?

2289
01:16:24,260 --> 01:16:25,764
No, right?

2290
01:16:26,359 --> 01:16:28,835
Is it better to have more?

2291
01:16:29,399 --> 01:16:30,505
Seok Jin.

2292
01:16:31,229 --> 01:16:33,169
- Excuse me. - He succeeded once.

2293
01:16:33,170 --> 01:16:34,669
Did I have to send it?

2294
01:16:34,670 --> 01:16:35,875
(He doesn't indicate the subject.)

2295
01:16:36,600 --> 01:16:39,368
(Laughing)

2296
01:16:39,369 --> 01:16:40,538
What did you do?

2297
01:16:40,539 --> 01:16:43,038
- Look. - Did you keep it?

2298
01:16:43,039 --> 01:16:45,654
- I don't think he sent it. - What did you do?

2299
01:16:46,010 --> 01:16:47,925
What did Seok Jin do?

2300
01:16:48,050 --> 01:16:49,825
Wait a minute.

2301
01:16:50,079 --> 01:16:51,564
I have 16 photos.

2302
01:16:51,720 --> 01:16:54,618
Those don't meet the condition.

2303
01:16:54,619 --> 01:16:56,089
They don't meet the condition.

2304
01:16:56,090 --> 01:16:58,234
What did he do and when?

2305
01:16:58,789 --> 01:17:02,228
If Se Chan guesses the hidden mission correctly,

2306
01:17:02,229 --> 01:17:03,959
everyone gets one vote each.

2307
01:17:03,960 --> 01:17:05,705
It's taking photos.

2308
01:17:06,399 --> 01:17:07,999
What is the hidden mission?

2309
01:17:08,000 --> 01:17:08,999
(What does Se Chan think?)

2310
01:17:09,000 --> 01:17:10,075
The hidden mission is...

2311
01:17:11,170 --> 01:17:14,285
(If he answers correctly, no one gets additional votes.)

2312
01:17:14,409 --> 01:17:16,278
(Will Se Chan guess correctly?)

2313
01:17:16,279 --> 01:17:18,078
It's taking photos of my gums.

2314
01:17:18,079 --> 01:17:19,379
(Taking photos of my gums)

2315
01:17:19,380 --> 01:17:20,554
You failed.

2316
01:17:21,010 --> 01:17:22,148
(Se Chan fails to guess the mission.)

2317
01:17:22,149 --> 01:17:23,249
That's not right?

2318
01:17:23,250 --> 01:17:25,788
It's taking a closeup photo of any part of your body.

2319
01:17:25,789 --> 01:17:27,688
(Taking a close photo of Se Chan's body)

2320
01:17:27,689 --> 01:17:28,988
(He's a fool.)

2321
01:17:28,989 --> 01:17:30,158
You fool.

2322
01:17:30,159 --> 01:17:33,288
See? I have multiple photos. Right?

2323
01:17:33,289 --> 01:17:35,658
You may take the ballot.

2324
01:17:35,659 --> 01:17:36,959
(The evaluation voting starts.)

2325
01:17:36,960 --> 01:17:39,398
Everyone, you must consider this. Look at it carefully.

2326
01:17:39,399 --> 01:17:40,728
Can you analyze it?

2327
01:17:40,729 --> 01:17:42,099
It's confusing.

2328
01:17:42,100 --> 01:17:44,398
Seok Jin and Kwang Soo.

2329
01:17:44,399 --> 01:17:46,608
They're the two candidates today.

2330
01:17:46,609 --> 01:17:49,684
This is what Kwang Soo and Seok Jin have to do.

2331
01:17:49,840 --> 01:17:52,448
You must make everyone vote "dissatisfied".

2332
01:17:52,449 --> 01:17:53,448
- So? - Right.

2333
01:17:53,449 --> 01:17:55,849
If the host gives Jae Seok two badges,

2334
01:17:55,850 --> 01:17:57,849
- Will it be 3 to 1? - It'll be a fight among three.

2335
01:17:57,850 --> 01:18:00,419
- You have a way out. - It'll be a fight among three.

2336
01:18:00,420 --> 01:18:02,595
I'll vote for satisfied.

2337
01:18:04,420 --> 01:18:06,988
(I'll write "satisfied".)

2338
01:18:06,989 --> 01:18:08,434
Just end it here.

2339
01:18:08,529 --> 01:18:09,959
They have no way out.

2340
01:18:09,960 --> 01:18:11,929
As I do this...

2341
01:18:11,930 --> 01:18:15,038
- This is my vote. - You handed in three votes.

2342
01:18:15,039 --> 01:18:16,139
I handed mine in.

2343
01:18:16,140 --> 01:18:18,368
You're quick at calculating.

2344
01:18:18,369 --> 01:18:21,045
There's no need to plan strategies. It won't work.

2345
01:18:21,140 --> 01:18:23,009
- There's nothing. - Either way,

2346
01:18:23,010 --> 01:18:25,078
Se Chan is the only one with the key.

2347
01:18:25,079 --> 01:18:26,509
(Se Chan will choose the final person to be penalized.)

2348
01:18:26,510 --> 01:18:28,154
Look how Kwang Soo is thinking.

2349
01:18:29,750 --> 01:18:31,825
- We have the vote result. - Okay.

2350
01:18:31,949 --> 01:18:33,589
Everyone is satisfied, right?

2351
01:18:33,590 --> 01:18:35,488
Those who voted satisfied are...

2352
01:18:35,489 --> 01:18:36,965
- All members. - all members.

2353
01:18:37,890 --> 01:18:38,889
(Se Chan wins a Korean beef set.)

2354
01:18:38,890 --> 01:18:40,604
It can't be helped.

2355
01:18:40,689 --> 01:18:42,358
Se Chan gets Korean beef.

2356
01:18:42,359 --> 01:18:43,429
(He tries to flatter Se Chan.)

2357
01:18:43,430 --> 01:18:46,669
Yang Se Chan, Yang Se Chan

2358
01:18:46,670 --> 01:18:47,698
It was a lot of fun.

2359
01:18:47,699 --> 01:18:49,898
I wasn't just satisfied, I was completely satisfied.

2360
01:18:49,899 --> 01:18:53,669
Se Chan will choose out of the two...

2361
01:18:53,670 --> 01:18:55,184
who will be penalized.

2362
01:18:55,510 --> 01:18:57,849
The one with the most penalty badges will...

2363
01:18:57,850 --> 01:19:00,184
pick one of the remaining activities.

2364
01:19:01,649 --> 01:19:02,919
As a penalty,

2365
01:19:02,920 --> 01:19:05,925
he will stay behind and finish the activity.

2366
01:19:06,220 --> 01:19:07,749
Alone?

2367
01:19:07,750 --> 01:19:09,564
- Alone? - You can't pick someone to join?

2368
01:19:11,119 --> 01:19:13,188
- All right. - They must be nervous.

2369
01:19:13,189 --> 01:19:15,505
It's worse than the bungee jump.

2370
01:19:15,699 --> 01:19:17,059
It feels like we're at a cliff.

2371
01:19:17,060 --> 01:19:18,828
I feel like I'm standing at a cliff.

2372
01:19:18,829 --> 01:19:21,368
- Please. - Please count to three.

2373
01:19:21,369 --> 01:19:22,745
(Kwang Soo and Seok Jin's managers are very nervous.)

2374
01:19:24,140 --> 01:19:25,368
One.

2375
01:19:25,369 --> 01:19:27,169
(After the shoot, they'll spend at least 3 hours.)

2376
01:19:27,170 --> 01:19:28,309
Here I go.

2377
01:19:28,310 --> 01:19:30,014
(The one penalized will work without pay.)

2378
01:19:30,409 --> 01:19:31,879
I can't do this.

2379
01:19:31,880 --> 01:19:33,455
(Which member will get off work looking at the moon?)

2380
01:19:35,149 --> 01:19:36,224
Three!

2381
01:19:36,479 --> 01:19:38,665
(Kwang Soo is pushed.)

2382
01:19:39,590 --> 01:19:41,959
(But Seok Jin is pushed too.)

2383
01:19:41,960 --> 01:19:43,764
(What's the result?)

2384
01:19:45,229 --> 01:19:47,328
(The place is surrounded by white walls...)

2385
01:19:47,329 --> 01:19:49,898
(and an endless ceiling.)

2386
01:19:49,899 --> 01:19:53,575
(And an unidentified member enters this place.)

2387
01:19:57,039 --> 01:19:59,285
(It's Seok Jin.)

2388
01:19:59,640 --> 01:20:02,554
(Several hours ago, a member was chosen for the penalty.)

2389
01:20:02,609 --> 01:20:05,608
(Both of them were pushed.)

2390
01:20:05,609 --> 01:20:07,278
- Go home. - Okay!

2391
01:20:07,279 --> 01:20:08,694
You should go and do the penalty.

2392
01:20:09,420 --> 01:20:10,749
You should go and do the penalty.

2393
01:20:10,750 --> 01:20:11,749
(Se Chan chose Seok Jin.)

2394
01:20:11,750 --> 01:20:13,465
- Hey, you. - Goodness.

2395
01:20:14,250 --> 01:20:16,519
- I chose one. - 1, 2, 3.

2396
01:20:16,520 --> 01:20:17,688
(It's time to choose the penalty mission.)

2397
01:20:17,689 --> 01:20:19,889
The best game of tags is Freeze Tag.

2398
01:20:19,890 --> 01:20:23,599
You'll work in a cold storage at minus 20℃.

2399
01:20:23,600 --> 01:20:25,474
He really has to work.

2400
01:20:27,770 --> 01:20:29,839
(Seok Jin has come to this frozen kingdom to work.)

2401
01:20:29,840 --> 01:20:31,175
My gosh, this whole place...

2402
01:20:31,569 --> 01:20:33,545
The whole place is at minus 18℃?

2403
01:20:34,470 --> 01:20:37,778
This is a cold storage in Noryangjin Fish Market.

2404
01:20:37,779 --> 01:20:41,455
We can store about 4,000t of seafood.

2405
01:20:41,680 --> 01:20:43,595
My gosh, this place is huge.

2406
01:20:44,050 --> 01:20:45,618
Today, you're going...

2407
01:20:45,619 --> 01:20:48,519
to transport the boxes of salted mackerels...

2408
01:20:48,520 --> 01:20:50,089
to the empty lot over there.

2409
01:20:50,090 --> 01:20:52,264
This one? My gosh, it's freezing in here.

2410
01:20:54,729 --> 01:20:56,629
(A 54-year-old worker starts carrying the boxes.)

2411
01:20:56,630 --> 01:20:58,205
Gosh, it's so cold.

2412
01:20:59,569 --> 01:21:03,839
(There are no members who can listen to his complaints here.)

2413
01:21:03,840 --> 01:21:05,709
(He worked for over 30 minutes,)

2414
01:21:05,710 --> 01:21:09,014
(but it's only worth 30 seconds of footage.)

2415
01:21:09,539 --> 01:21:12,148
(However, the boxes are piling up now.)

2416
01:21:12,149 --> 01:21:15,054
(Stacking them up neatly)

2417
01:21:16,119 --> 01:21:17,148
I'm done.

2418
01:21:17,149 --> 01:21:18,589
(He speaks for the 1st time after 33 minutes.)

2419
01:21:18,590 --> 01:21:21,519
Everyone, was today's episode entertaining?

2420
01:21:21,520 --> 01:21:23,759
I'll see you next week. Let's go!

2421
01:21:23,760 --> 01:21:26,665
(Seok Jin completes his penalty mission.)

2422
01:21:27,090 --> 01:21:29,799
(In autumn, your interests in liberal arts begin to grow.)

2423
01:21:29,800 --> 01:21:32,345
(The members will have a poetry contest.)

2424
01:21:32,470 --> 01:21:34,698
(Your face is long, Kwang Soo.)

2425
01:21:34,699 --> 01:21:36,144
(Your legs are long too.)

2426
01:21:36,199 --> 01:21:37,868
(But your knowledge is short.)

2427
01:21:37,869 --> 01:21:40,169
(He gets up at Jae Seok's original composition.)

2428
01:21:40,170 --> 01:21:42,608
(4 guests have come to participate in the contest.)

2429
01:21:42,609 --> 01:21:44,679
(Tiffany, Park Yu Na, Mina, and Hwang Chi Yeul)

2430
01:21:44,680 --> 01:21:48,519
(The party begins with this cheerful Pick-Me fairy.)

2431
01:21:48,520 --> 01:21:51,389
(And a master of a reciting singing method shows up.)

2432
01:21:51,390 --> 01:21:52,488
(However,)

2433
01:21:52,489 --> 01:21:55,488
(are these two dictionaries confidential files?)

2434
01:21:55,489 --> 01:21:58,889
(The members sense that something is off.)

2435
01:21:58,890 --> 01:22:01,858
(They face each other head-on without any willingness to yield.)

2436
01:22:01,859 --> 01:22:04,629
(The contest? The karaoke? Where did things start to go wrong?)

2437
01:22:04,630 --> 01:22:07,969
(What's the shocking secret the members have witnessed?)

2438
01:22:07,970 --> 01:22:09,175
(Secret Code: Autumn Ambush)
