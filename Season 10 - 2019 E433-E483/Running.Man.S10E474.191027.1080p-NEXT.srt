1
00:00:05,610 --> 00:00:06,608
(On an autumn day with ripe fruits...)

2
00:00:06,609 --> 00:00:08,809
- Hello. - Hi.

3
00:00:08,810 --> 00:00:10,509
- Hello. - Hello.

4
00:00:10,510 --> 00:00:11,755
Hi.

5
00:00:12,039 --> 00:00:13,425
(Staring)

6
00:00:13,450 --> 00:00:14,608
- Jong Kook. - Yes?

7
00:00:14,609 --> 00:00:16,118
Did your style change?

8
00:00:16,119 --> 00:00:19,389
I came back this morning from LA. So I'm in my LA outfit.

9
00:00:19,390 --> 00:00:21,648
In fact, this is my own outfit.

10
00:00:21,649 --> 00:00:22,864
(His LA outfit is different from his all-black outfit in Korea.)

11
00:00:22,964 --> 00:00:26,634
My gosh. Look at this tiger.

12
00:00:26,635 --> 00:00:29,434
(It's hiding behind a cute puppy character.)

13
00:00:29,435 --> 00:00:32,449
- I caught a tiger. - You caught a tiger.

14
00:00:32,604 --> 00:00:34,974
- I got a tiger. - I saw him from the back first.

15
00:00:34,975 --> 00:00:36,673
I was in my car, and I saw him going up.

16
00:00:36,674 --> 00:00:39,383
I was wondering why he wore a vest with the tiger pattern.

17
00:00:39,384 --> 00:00:41,284
- I didn't know. - I realized that it wasn't a vest.

18
00:00:41,285 --> 00:00:43,153
- I only saw Snoopy in the front. - Look at that tiger.

19
00:00:43,154 --> 00:00:44,290
I didn't check the back.

20
00:00:44,514 --> 00:00:46,583
Before you start your mission today,

21
00:00:46,584 --> 00:00:48,894
two guests will be joining our show.

22
00:00:48,895 --> 00:00:50,199
- Are they here? - My gosh.

23
00:00:50,654 --> 00:00:53,564
Let me introduce the lead stars of a new SBS drama...

24
00:00:53,565 --> 00:00:54,763
- Who are they? - to you.

25
00:00:54,764 --> 00:00:56,640
All right. Come on out.

26
00:00:57,065 --> 00:00:59,739
- The drama will be a hit. - Right.

27
00:01:00,035 --> 00:01:02,849
(Who are today's guests?)

28
00:01:04,435 --> 00:01:05,979
- It's Go Min Si. - I see.

29
00:01:06,075 --> 00:01:07,604
- Hello. - And Hwang Bo Ra is here.

30
00:01:07,605 --> 00:01:10,319
- Oh, right. - She's in "Vagabond".

31
00:01:10,675 --> 00:01:11,713
- Hello. - hi.

32
00:01:11,714 --> 00:01:13,183
- Please come to the center. - Hi.

33
00:01:13,184 --> 00:01:15,690
- You're in "Vagabond". - We've met before, Bo Ra.

34
00:01:15,914 --> 00:01:17,514
- Have you been well? - Hello.

35
00:01:17,515 --> 00:01:18,614
(Giggling)

36
00:01:18,615 --> 00:01:20,330
Why is she happy to see Kwang Soo?

37
00:01:20,785 --> 00:01:24,224
Min Si, can you introduce yourself to the viewers?

38
00:01:24,225 --> 00:01:28,170
Hello. My name is Go Min Si.

39
00:01:29,235 --> 00:01:31,064
(This new talented actress...)

40
00:01:31,065 --> 00:01:33,764
(will lead the second half of "Secret Boutique.")

41
00:01:33,765 --> 00:01:38,409
(She's the scene-stealer with her sly role in "The Witch".)

42
00:01:39,405 --> 00:01:42,374
- I was Myung Hee in "The Witch". - Right.

43
00:01:42,375 --> 00:01:43,644
The heroine had a friend.

44
00:01:43,645 --> 00:01:45,043
- Right. - That friend?

45
00:01:45,044 --> 00:01:46,083
She's the friend.

46
00:01:46,084 --> 00:01:48,590
- She was really good. - She spoke with a dialect.

47
00:01:48,785 --> 00:01:50,614
- You ate eggs on the train. - That's right.

48
00:01:50,615 --> 00:01:51,984
- You were that friend? - That's right.

49
00:01:51,985 --> 00:01:53,683
- You were that friend. - My gosh.

50
00:01:53,684 --> 00:01:55,083
I know who you are.

51
00:01:55,084 --> 00:01:56,654
- She's that friend. - You're so pretty now.

52
00:01:56,655 --> 00:01:58,569
- I didn't know she was this pretty. - Is that so?

53
00:01:58,854 --> 00:02:00,323
You're so pretty now.

54
00:02:00,324 --> 00:02:02,364
- She was so good in the movie. - By the way...

55
00:02:02,365 --> 00:02:04,264
Do you die at the end of the movie?

56
00:02:04,265 --> 00:02:05,333
- Pardon? - Do you die?

57
00:02:05,334 --> 00:02:06,564
- Me? I lived. - Yes.

58
00:02:06,565 --> 00:02:08,974
You did? I'm sorry.

59
00:02:08,975 --> 00:02:11,174
(She's surprised.)

60
00:02:11,175 --> 00:02:13,174
- Why did you kill her role? - You didn't watch the movie.

61
00:02:13,175 --> 00:02:15,573
- I'm sorry. - You should look it up online.

62
00:02:15,574 --> 00:02:17,989
- I'm sorry. - Come on, Seok Jin.

63
00:02:18,644 --> 00:02:20,643
- Seok Jin. What's up with you? - I'm sorry.

64
00:02:20,644 --> 00:02:22,554
A lot of people died in the movie.

65
00:02:22,555 --> 00:02:25,459
- Right. - A lot of people died in the movie.

66
00:02:25,924 --> 00:02:28,554
- She was in "Live" with me. - Really?

67
00:02:28,555 --> 00:02:30,254
- Yes, we worked together. - Is that so?

68
00:02:30,255 --> 00:02:31,254
What was that drama about?

69
00:02:31,255 --> 00:02:33,064
- What? - "What was that drama about?"

70
00:02:33,065 --> 00:02:34,163
("Live"?)

71
00:02:34,164 --> 00:02:35,594
(What?)

72
00:02:35,595 --> 00:02:36,663
Are you serious right now?

73
00:02:36,664 --> 00:02:38,969
- Haha. - Are you serious or what?

74
00:02:39,134 --> 00:02:41,064
- "Live". - What "Live"?

75
00:02:41,065 --> 00:02:43,034
- I get that I film... Gosh. - I didn't see you sing live.

76
00:02:43,035 --> 00:02:45,233
- You completely ignore me. - Are you talking about "Today"?

77
00:02:45,234 --> 00:02:47,380
- What? What are you talking about? - That's not the same show.

78
00:02:47,544 --> 00:02:49,043
He meant live streaming on Instagram.

79
00:02:49,044 --> 00:02:50,613
(Not that. It's live streaming on Instagram.)

80
00:02:50,614 --> 00:02:52,660
I don't do live streaming on social media.

81
00:02:52,884 --> 00:02:54,584
- It's called "Live". - What "Live"?

82
00:02:54,585 --> 00:02:57,260
- It's not that. It's a drama. - Live streaming on Instagram.

83
00:02:57,484 --> 00:02:59,499
Live streaming on Instagram.

84
00:03:00,255 --> 00:03:01,554
(Min Si's brief introduction is over.)

85
00:03:01,555 --> 00:03:02,754
- This is crazy. - It's hilarious.

86
00:03:02,755 --> 00:03:03,893
It's not on social media.

87
00:03:03,894 --> 00:03:06,693
Min Si is joining us today.

88
00:03:06,694 --> 00:03:10,339
- Bo Ra will also join us today. - Right.

89
00:03:11,595 --> 00:03:14,739
(This irreplaceable scene-stealer puts on superb performances.)

90
00:03:15,065 --> 00:03:19,643
(She's an excellent actress with heart-moving performances.)

91
00:03:19,644 --> 00:03:21,073
(The versatile queen, Hwang Bo Ra)

92
00:03:21,074 --> 00:03:24,774
- Well, Bo Ra worked with Kwang Soo. - Right.

93
00:03:24,775 --> 00:03:26,483
- She was in "Entourage". - That's right.

94
00:03:26,484 --> 00:03:27,714
- What's that? - What's that?

95
00:03:27,715 --> 00:03:30,383
- What? - I see. You wear clothes in large.

96
00:03:30,384 --> 00:03:32,189
- Stop it. - I'm serious. What does that mean?

97
00:03:32,255 --> 00:03:34,823
- Did you hear him? - It says, "Entou" here.

98
00:03:34,824 --> 00:03:36,693
He definitely wears large clothes.

99
00:03:36,694 --> 00:03:38,054
He wears extra-large.

100
00:03:38,055 --> 00:03:39,693
- It's the name of a drama. - It's a drama?

101
00:03:39,694 --> 00:03:42,024
I didn't know you debuted 17 years ago.

102
00:03:42,025 --> 00:03:44,363
- Yes. - I read that you debuted...

103
00:03:44,364 --> 00:03:47,233
after getting hired as the 10th class by the SBS.

104
00:03:47,234 --> 00:03:49,974
- She was hired by the TV station? - You debuted after getting hired...

105
00:03:49,975 --> 00:03:52,904
(Back then, the TV stations used to hire actors and actresses.)

106
00:03:52,905 --> 00:03:53,974
- She was a talent. - She was hired by the station?

107
00:03:53,975 --> 00:03:55,974
- You were on the traditional path. - Right.

108
00:03:55,975 --> 00:03:57,274
I was on the traditional path.

109
00:03:57,275 --> 00:03:59,584
Nowadays, TV stations don't hire actors and actresses.

110
00:03:59,585 --> 00:04:00,584
- They don't? - No, they don't.

111
00:04:00,585 --> 00:04:03,784
- I used to get paid 300 dollars... - My gosh.

112
00:04:03,785 --> 00:04:05,923
and go to work at the SBS station in Tanhyeon.

113
00:04:05,924 --> 00:04:06,983
She's old.

114
00:04:06,984 --> 00:04:09,094
- I see. - Do people say that a lot?

115
00:04:09,095 --> 00:04:10,453
(Hwang Bo Ra, also known as the Oldie)

116
00:04:10,454 --> 00:04:12,393
She's really kind. Earlier, we talked about...

117
00:04:12,394 --> 00:04:14,163
Wait, am I "molder" than you? Sorry, I meant, "older".

118
00:04:14,164 --> 00:04:15,524
- Am I older than you? - Yes, you are.

119
00:04:15,525 --> 00:04:16,964
- Really? - I was born in 1985.

120
00:04:16,965 --> 00:04:19,334
I see. My gosh, I'm so old.

121
00:04:19,335 --> 00:04:20,464
She was born in 1982.

122
00:04:20,465 --> 00:04:22,673
I was born in 1983. My gosh, I'm so old.

123
00:04:22,674 --> 00:04:24,350
(She was born in 1982.)

124
00:04:24,905 --> 00:04:26,074
Anyway...

125
00:04:26,075 --> 00:04:27,603
- You were born in 1983? - Yes.

126
00:04:27,604 --> 00:04:28,603
You weren't born in 1984?

127
00:04:28,604 --> 00:04:30,689
No, I was born in 1983.

128
00:04:31,075 --> 00:04:32,913
- You have a lot of anger in you. - Yes.

129
00:04:32,914 --> 00:04:34,860
- Yes, I do. - She has a lot of anger in her.

130
00:04:35,184 --> 00:04:36,384
- Right. - It's very important.

131
00:04:36,385 --> 00:04:38,413
So you survived in your movie,

132
00:04:38,414 --> 00:04:39,629
- and you were born in 1983. - Yes.

133
00:04:40,184 --> 00:04:44,369
Gosh, Seok Jin. He rarely feels uncomfortable around the guests.

134
00:04:44,554 --> 00:04:46,163
I haven't seen you gather your hands like that for a while.

135
00:04:46,164 --> 00:04:47,563
- No, that's not true. - His ears are so red.

136
00:04:47,564 --> 00:04:49,793
- He's known to be bossy. - No.

137
00:04:49,794 --> 00:04:52,233
- He's really bossy around guests. - Is that so?

138
00:04:52,234 --> 00:04:54,233
I've never seen him retreat.

139
00:04:54,234 --> 00:04:56,074
He leaned back like this.

140
00:04:56,075 --> 00:04:58,404
- There's a gap between them. - You must have a goal then.

141
00:04:58,405 --> 00:05:00,344
(Butting in abruptly)

142
00:05:00,345 --> 00:05:01,704
That came out of nowhere.

143
00:05:01,705 --> 00:05:02,714
That's an odd interview.

144
00:05:02,715 --> 00:05:04,720
You didn't get any sleep last night, did you?

145
00:05:04,874 --> 00:05:06,483
- Did you sleep well? - I slept really well.

146
00:05:06,484 --> 00:05:07,813
- You did? - I went to sleep at 8pm.

147
00:05:07,814 --> 00:05:10,559
I see. You did. I can't get along with them today.

148
00:05:10,785 --> 00:05:12,090
I went to bed early.

149
00:05:12,354 --> 00:05:13,784
What time did you go to bed, Min Si?

150
00:05:13,785 --> 00:05:14,929
I couldn't go to sleep.

151
00:05:15,054 --> 00:05:17,493
- Why not? - Since I have a lot of anger,

152
00:05:17,494 --> 00:05:19,264
I go to yoga early in the morning.

153
00:05:19,265 --> 00:05:20,623
- What time do you go to yoga? - So...

154
00:05:20,624 --> 00:05:22,324
I woke up at 4 a.m. today.

155
00:05:22,325 --> 00:05:23,764
- You went to yoga at 4 a.m.? - Yes.

156
00:05:23,765 --> 00:05:25,964
Why do you go to yoga at 4 a.m.?

157
00:05:25,965 --> 00:05:27,433
I have a lot of anger inside me.

158
00:05:27,434 --> 00:05:28,603
- "Anger"? - To calm your anger?

159
00:05:28,604 --> 00:05:30,974
Yes. When I release energy...

160
00:05:30,975 --> 00:05:32,274
Does your instructor come at 4 a.m. too?

161
00:05:32,275 --> 00:05:33,480
Yes. We do yoga together.

162
00:05:33,504 --> 00:05:35,503
That must be really hard on your instructor.

163
00:05:35,504 --> 00:05:37,373
(Getting territorial)

164
00:05:37,374 --> 00:05:38,813
He's starting now.

165
00:05:38,814 --> 00:05:40,259
- He started. - He'll do that to her.

166
00:05:40,715 --> 00:05:42,220
Here's what I think.

167
00:05:42,314 --> 00:05:45,829
She might get home really late, so she might sleep on her yoga mat.

168
00:05:46,684 --> 00:05:50,499
When Min Si comes, she gets up and says hello to her.

169
00:05:51,195 --> 00:05:52,293
("Extreme Job: How to Be Min Si's Yoga Instructor")

170
00:05:52,294 --> 00:05:54,699
- Goodness. - She's the client, after all.

171
00:05:54,765 --> 00:05:56,194
That's an extreme job.

172
00:05:56,195 --> 00:05:57,369
- Extreme job. - Yes.

173
00:05:57,564 --> 00:06:00,834
Today, you'll divide into 2 teams of 5.

174
00:06:00,835 --> 00:06:02,879
Today's race is called Catch the Thieves Right Under Our Nose.

175
00:06:03,475 --> 00:06:05,404
- I see. - Among you,

176
00:06:05,405 --> 00:06:07,774
- there are two thieves. - Who are they?

177
00:06:07,775 --> 00:06:08,904
- There are thieves? - Shouldn't we start the race...

178
00:06:08,905 --> 00:06:10,074
after catching the thieves first?

179
00:06:10,075 --> 00:06:11,689
Why am I the thief again?

180
00:06:12,374 --> 00:06:13,613
It's really not me.

181
00:06:13,614 --> 00:06:15,313
- You look like a thief today. - No, I'm not.

182
00:06:15,314 --> 00:06:16,553
- I'm not a thief. - You dressed up like one too.

183
00:06:16,554 --> 00:06:18,160
No, it's not true. This outfit is for autumn.

184
00:06:19,525 --> 00:06:20,623
I'm not a thief.

185
00:06:20,624 --> 00:06:21,724
- Your outfit tells that you are. - No, I'm not.

186
00:06:21,725 --> 00:06:23,154
Only the members,

187
00:06:23,155 --> 00:06:25,853
excluding the thieves, will receive 10 gold bars.

188
00:06:25,854 --> 00:06:27,423
The race consists of four rounds.

189
00:06:27,424 --> 00:06:30,233
For each round, the thieves must do hidden missions against the members.

190
00:06:30,234 --> 00:06:31,894
And they can steal the gold bars from the members...

191
00:06:31,895 --> 00:06:33,009
every time they complete a mission.

192
00:06:33,104 --> 00:06:35,834
If the combined number of stolen gold bars goes over 10,

193
00:06:35,835 --> 00:06:36,974
the thieves will win.

194
00:06:36,975 --> 00:06:39,603
However, if the two thieves are on the same team,

195
00:06:39,604 --> 00:06:41,574
all of their completed missions will not count.

196
00:06:41,575 --> 00:06:43,274
And the number of gold bars for the members will not change.

197
00:06:43,275 --> 00:06:45,514
- They can't be on the same team. - We must be smart when we team-up.

198
00:06:45,515 --> 00:06:48,144
(For them to gather gold bars, they must be on different teams.)

199
00:06:48,145 --> 00:06:49,584
We must be smart when we team-up.

200
00:06:49,585 --> 00:06:50,784
My gosh, seriously.

201
00:06:50,785 --> 00:06:51,983
- He sounded really awkward, right? - How...

202
00:06:51,984 --> 00:06:54,084
He didn't mean any of what he said.

203
00:06:54,085 --> 00:06:55,759
"We must be smart when we team-up."

204
00:06:56,424 --> 00:06:57,600
What?

205
00:06:58,325 --> 00:07:00,069
- We can tell right away. - Are you AlphaGo?

206
00:07:00,695 --> 00:07:02,094
After each round,

207
00:07:02,095 --> 00:07:04,594
the number of the gold bars stolen will be revealed to everyone.

208
00:07:04,595 --> 00:07:07,103
And you can find out how many gold bars you have...

209
00:07:07,104 --> 00:07:08,739
after the 2nd and 4th rounds individually.

210
00:07:08,905 --> 00:07:10,634
And the winning team can switch...

211
00:07:10,635 --> 00:07:13,480
a member with another member of the other team after each round.

212
00:07:14,575 --> 00:07:16,344
If you catch both of the thieves,

213
00:07:16,345 --> 00:07:18,813
and their combined stolen bars is under 10, the members will win.

214
00:07:18,814 --> 00:07:21,284
The member with the highest number of gold bars will get a prize.

215
00:07:21,285 --> 00:07:22,413
And the member with the lowest number...

216
00:07:22,414 --> 00:07:24,613
will face the penalty with the thieves.

217
00:07:24,614 --> 00:07:27,699
- Bring in the table now. - There's a table.

218
00:07:27,825 --> 00:07:29,024
What's that?

219
00:07:29,025 --> 00:07:30,724
(What is that?)

220
00:07:30,725 --> 00:07:32,129
What? "Dialect", "Dance".

221
00:07:32,195 --> 00:07:34,199
- "Flexibility". - What's this?

222
00:07:34,225 --> 00:07:35,770
I'll go for the dialect.

223
00:07:35,794 --> 00:07:37,233
All right. Starting now,

224
00:07:37,234 --> 00:07:39,834
the thieves will begin their hidden missions.

225
00:07:39,835 --> 00:07:41,503
- Starting now? - You can start your missions now.

226
00:07:41,504 --> 00:07:42,904
There are hidden missions.

227
00:07:42,905 --> 00:07:44,433
- What are you doing? - I was stretching.

228
00:07:44,434 --> 00:07:46,103
There are hidden missions. What are you doing?

229
00:07:46,104 --> 00:07:48,144
- I was stretching. No, it's not me. - That was so random.

230
00:07:48,145 --> 00:07:49,850
I was just stretching.

231
00:07:49,945 --> 00:07:51,749
Jong Kook just rubbed his eyes.

232
00:07:52,114 --> 00:07:53,960
Hold on. This is ridiculous.

233
00:07:54,044 --> 00:07:55,884
When I was touching my nose, she looked at me.

234
00:07:55,885 --> 00:07:56,884
So I stopped for no reason.

235
00:07:56,885 --> 00:07:58,129
(So Min looked at him when he touched his nose.)

236
00:07:59,054 --> 00:08:00,784
(My nose is itchy.)

237
00:08:00,785 --> 00:08:03,100
(Is that the mission?)

238
00:08:03,195 --> 00:08:04,553
- All of a sudden, - I mean...

239
00:08:04,554 --> 00:08:05,829
- he flinched. - when she looked at me...

240
00:08:06,465 --> 00:08:08,694
But if that's the hidden mission, it's too easy.

241
00:08:08,695 --> 00:08:09,793
It'd be obvious.

242
00:08:09,794 --> 00:08:11,894
The first mission will decide your teams.

243
00:08:11,895 --> 00:08:13,179
It's called Pick Me Up.

244
00:08:13,804 --> 00:08:15,163
The guests will be the team captains...

245
00:08:15,164 --> 00:08:17,204
and scout four members to their teams.

246
00:08:17,205 --> 00:08:20,373
The members will choose 1 out of 4 keywords for talents.

247
00:08:20,374 --> 00:08:23,043
Two members and the two guests who chose the same keyword...

248
00:08:23,044 --> 00:08:25,043
will have a battle of the talent, and the winner of the battle...

249
00:08:25,044 --> 00:08:26,559
will get one point.

250
00:08:26,585 --> 00:08:30,189
And the winner can pick the team for the member who chose the word.

251
00:08:30,684 --> 00:08:32,129
(Smirking)

252
00:08:32,924 --> 00:08:34,853
(Approaching while the rule is being explained)

253
00:08:34,854 --> 00:08:37,129
- I'll go for this. - Same here.

254
00:08:37,494 --> 00:08:38,794
- This is mine. - Me too.

255
00:08:38,795 --> 00:08:40,099
I got it.

256
00:08:40,364 --> 00:08:41,664
I ought to go for this.

257
00:08:41,665 --> 00:08:44,339
Hey, give back the dialect badge.

258
00:08:45,394 --> 00:08:46,903
- Give it back. - I need that too.

259
00:08:46,904 --> 00:08:49,103
- Jae Seok, go for the dance badge. - Stop it.

260
00:08:49,104 --> 00:08:51,010
- You should go for that. - Hey.

261
00:08:51,205 --> 00:08:53,403
Do you need a beating to come to your senses?

262
00:08:53,404 --> 00:08:55,819
(Speaking with a dialect all of a sudden)

263
00:08:56,215 --> 00:08:58,050
"Do you need a beating to come to your senses?"

264
00:08:58,315 --> 00:09:00,084
My gosh, Jae Seok.

265
00:09:00,085 --> 00:09:02,290
- Listen. That belongs to me. - "Listen"?

266
00:09:02,415 --> 00:09:04,253
I said, "listen".

267
00:09:04,254 --> 00:09:06,599
- "Listen"? - "Listen. That belongs to me."

268
00:09:07,484 --> 00:09:09,324
My gosh, she's speaking with the dialect.

269
00:09:09,325 --> 00:09:11,123
- "Listen". - She just spoke with the dialect.

270
00:09:11,124 --> 00:09:12,794
I'm really awful at this.

271
00:09:12,795 --> 00:09:14,493
- Do we just pick one? - Special talents?

272
00:09:14,494 --> 00:09:16,270
- There's nothing to pick from. - Just like this?

273
00:09:16,394 --> 00:09:17,670
- I hate dancing. - Yes.

274
00:09:17,734 --> 00:09:19,263
- I hate dancing too. - Why...

275
00:09:19,264 --> 00:09:21,280
- I'm not flexible at all. - I'm stuck with this.

276
00:09:21,364 --> 00:09:23,010
Ji Hyo chose the dance badge.

277
00:09:23,034 --> 00:09:26,103
- Hey. - There's nothing I can do here.

278
00:09:26,104 --> 00:09:28,179
But she's pretty good at dancing nowadays.

279
00:09:28,644 --> 00:09:30,044
- She's pretty good now. - Yes, that's right.

280
00:09:30,045 --> 00:09:31,920
(Dancing? That's a piece of cake.)

281
00:09:32,845 --> 00:09:34,243
(Dialect: Jae Seok and Jong Kook, Dance: Ji Hyo and So Min,)

282
00:09:34,244 --> 00:09:35,643
(Flexibility: Seok Jin and Haha, Tricks: Kwang Soo and Se Chan)

283
00:09:35,644 --> 00:09:37,513
All right. As for the first talent,

284
00:09:37,514 --> 00:09:39,160
- it's the battle of dialect. - I see.

285
00:09:39,185 --> 00:09:40,424
- It's the dialect. - Use the members' names...

286
00:09:40,425 --> 00:09:42,383
to do an acrostic poem while speaking with a dialect.

287
00:09:42,384 --> 00:09:44,393
- The best poem will win this round. - I see.

288
00:09:44,394 --> 00:09:46,224
- Jae Seok, why are you there? - Why did you pick that?

289
00:09:46,225 --> 00:09:47,324
I chose the dialect badge.

290
00:09:47,325 --> 00:09:48,900
- I'm good at that. - Use the members' names?

291
00:09:49,065 --> 00:09:50,763
(Jae Seok will go up against Jong Kook.)

292
00:09:50,764 --> 00:09:52,434
The members who chose the dialect badge and the guests...

293
00:09:52,435 --> 00:09:55,010
- will play this round. - The four of us?

294
00:09:55,065 --> 00:09:56,403
- I see. - The best member will win.

295
00:09:56,404 --> 00:09:57,733
Go ahead, Bo Ra.

296
00:09:57,734 --> 00:09:59,643
Hold on. This is all very sudden.

297
00:09:59,644 --> 00:10:01,243
Why don't you run your mouth now?

298
00:10:01,244 --> 00:10:02,750
(Launching the first attack)

299
00:10:03,014 --> 00:10:04,444
- What did you say? - Run your mouth now.

300
00:10:04,445 --> 00:10:06,983
Why don't you run your mouth? Go ahead.

301
00:10:06,984 --> 00:10:09,184
No, we don't say that. No one uses that expression.

302
00:10:09,185 --> 00:10:11,414
They sound so awkward. Why are they speaking with a dialect?

303
00:10:11,415 --> 00:10:13,983
(She's blunt.)

304
00:10:13,984 --> 00:10:15,054
You guys are terrible.

305
00:10:15,055 --> 00:10:16,294
Jong Kook sounds a bit awkward, right?

306
00:10:16,295 --> 00:10:18,429
- No. - They are awful.

307
00:10:19,254 --> 00:10:21,123
- You guys are terrible at it. - They are terrible.

308
00:10:21,124 --> 00:10:22,324
- You're awful. - We're good.

309
00:10:22,325 --> 00:10:23,839
- We're good at it. - Then...

310
00:10:23,894 --> 00:10:25,270
Who wants to go first?

311
00:10:25,335 --> 00:10:26,664
- I'll go first. - Okay, Min Si.

312
00:10:26,665 --> 00:10:28,363
- I'll use Kwang Soo's name. - Kwang Soo's name?

313
00:10:28,364 --> 00:10:29,773
- Let's do this. - Okay.

314
00:10:29,774 --> 00:10:31,079
- Speak with the dialect. - Okay.

315
00:10:31,634 --> 00:10:32,773
- L. - L.

316
00:10:32,774 --> 00:10:35,880
(Exclamation)

317
00:10:37,114 --> 00:10:38,814
(She starts smoothly with an exclamation.)

318
00:10:38,815 --> 00:10:40,219
- K. - That's the Jeolla dialect.

319
00:10:40,744 --> 00:10:43,054
Kwang Soo? I know him.

320
00:10:43,055 --> 00:10:44,490
Isn't he that guy?

321
00:10:44,555 --> 00:10:45,783
- S. - S.

322
00:10:45,784 --> 00:10:49,400
(It's going quite well. How will she finish the poem?)

323
00:10:49,524 --> 00:10:50,699
Sorghum straw.

324
00:10:51,754 --> 00:10:54,670
(He's a sorghum straw.)

325
00:10:54,764 --> 00:10:56,270
- She's good. - He's a long stick, sorghum straw.

326
00:10:56,835 --> 00:10:58,709
- She's good. - Yes, she's good.

327
00:10:59,335 --> 00:11:01,503
- That's the Chungcheong dialect. - Isn't he a sorghum straw?

328
00:11:01,504 --> 00:11:02,579
Sorghum straw.

329
00:11:03,075 --> 00:11:04,204
That was great.

330
00:11:04,205 --> 00:11:05,449
You're up, Bo Ra.

331
00:11:05,475 --> 00:11:07,319
Bo Ra, aren't you good at speaking with a dialect?

332
00:11:07,404 --> 00:11:08,903
Yes, I'm from Busan.

333
00:11:08,904 --> 00:11:10,674
Well, speaking with a dialect is a piece of cake.

334
00:11:10,675 --> 00:11:13,059
- You're from Busan? - That's the authentic dialect.

335
00:11:13,284 --> 00:11:16,459
I'll do a poem with Jae Seok's name.

336
00:11:16,484 --> 00:11:18,160
With my name? Great.

337
00:11:18,215 --> 00:11:19,459
All right. Y.

338
00:11:19,784 --> 00:11:21,699
Yu Jae Seok's work...

339
00:11:22,585 --> 00:11:23,829
J.

340
00:11:24,124 --> 00:11:27,040
J... Hold on.

341
00:11:28,325 --> 00:11:30,633
- Are you finished? - Hold on.

342
00:11:30,634 --> 00:11:33,579
It's been a while since I saw a guest's chin shake like that.

343
00:11:34,305 --> 00:11:35,363
(Shaking)

344
00:11:35,364 --> 00:11:36,609
Bo Ra, you can do it.

345
00:11:37,435 --> 00:11:38,733
(Her acrostic poem isn't as good as her dialect.)

346
00:11:38,734 --> 00:11:40,574
- Bo Ra's chin... - Just say something.

347
00:11:40,575 --> 00:11:42,420
Jae Seok's work... J...

348
00:11:43,114 --> 00:11:45,414
- I'll use Min Si's name. - I see.

349
00:11:45,415 --> 00:11:46,414
All right. G.

350
00:11:46,415 --> 00:11:47,844
Gosh, enough. I've had it enough.

351
00:11:47,845 --> 00:11:48,883
M.

352
00:11:48,884 --> 00:11:50,684
(Gosh, enough. I've had it enough.)

353
00:11:50,685 --> 00:11:51,959
(Impressed)

354
00:11:52,185 --> 00:11:54,359
Man, what are you doing in the folk village?

355
00:11:54,524 --> 00:11:55,584
- S. - S.

356
00:11:55,585 --> 00:11:57,454
(She just needs to finish the poem with the last syllable.)

357
00:11:57,455 --> 00:12:00,040
(Will she be able to redeem her reputation as the local from Busan?)

358
00:12:00,195 --> 00:12:01,469
Stream water.

359
00:12:02,494 --> 00:12:03,809
You scared me for a second.

360
00:12:05,295 --> 00:12:06,334
Stream water.

361
00:12:06,335 --> 00:12:07,939
(A random line)

362
00:12:08,065 --> 00:12:10,449
She just made it sound bold. That's it.

363
00:12:10,475 --> 00:12:12,903
- She's just saying whatever. - She's just blurting it out.

364
00:12:12,904 --> 00:12:15,143
- I almost had it. - She said whatever she thought of.

365
00:12:15,144 --> 00:12:16,674
Jae Seok, show them what you've got.

366
00:12:16,675 --> 00:12:18,074
- Go for it. - Shall I?

367
00:12:18,075 --> 00:12:19,344
Jae Seok, go for it.

368
00:12:19,345 --> 00:12:20,883
- The problem is... - Which dialect?

369
00:12:20,884 --> 00:12:22,914
- his acrostic poems are awful. - They are awful?

370
00:12:22,915 --> 00:12:24,859
(His acrostic poems are awful.)

371
00:12:25,215 --> 00:12:26,853
What should we do? Should we change your talent?

372
00:12:26,854 --> 00:12:28,184
- He might be good at the dialect. - Should we let you change?

373
00:12:28,185 --> 00:12:29,454
Be quiet.

374
00:12:29,455 --> 00:12:31,253
- Just give me anything. - Do one with Bo Ra's name.

375
00:12:31,254 --> 00:12:32,929
- Hwang Bo Ra? Okay. - Yes.

376
00:12:33,124 --> 00:12:35,370
- All right. Here we go. H. - H.

377
00:12:35,665 --> 00:12:38,339
Hwang Bo Ra. I've been watching you.

378
00:12:39,295 --> 00:12:41,564
Hwang Bo Ra. I've been watching you.

379
00:12:41,565 --> 00:12:43,174
(What kind of dialect is that?)

380
00:12:43,175 --> 00:12:45,579
You know what? Let me take a good look.

381
00:12:46,175 --> 00:12:49,344
- I think I've seen you somewhere. - He's trying to think right now.

382
00:12:49,345 --> 00:12:51,920
I keep getting confused about where I've seen you from.

383
00:12:51,945 --> 00:12:55,314
- B. - I think it was around Haeundae.

384
00:12:55,315 --> 00:12:57,084
(I'm not done yet.)

385
00:12:57,085 --> 00:13:00,030
- Hey, move onto the next syllable. - I might've seen you there.

386
00:13:00,254 --> 00:13:02,924
- Or I might be mistaken. - B.

387
00:13:02,925 --> 00:13:04,569
Right now, he's scared of B the most.

388
00:13:04,925 --> 00:13:07,040
Banging my head against a wall,

389
00:13:07,425 --> 00:13:10,069
I was still confused if it was Bo Ra or not.

390
00:13:10,465 --> 00:13:11,910
Are you doing pansori?

391
00:13:12,165 --> 00:13:13,834
- R. - R.

392
00:13:13,835 --> 00:13:15,439
Are you on the radio show too?

393
00:13:16,264 --> 00:13:18,910
(That was the simplest way to wrap up the poem.)

394
00:13:19,104 --> 00:13:21,349
He only thought of the last line.

395
00:13:21,445 --> 00:13:22,750
But he couldn't come up with the second line.

396
00:13:23,045 --> 00:13:25,143
- Hey, be quiet. - You only thought of the last one.

397
00:13:25,144 --> 00:13:27,084
- But you did it. - You'd better be quiet.

398
00:13:27,085 --> 00:13:28,743
- Let me do it with Seok Jin's name. - This is hard.

399
00:13:28,744 --> 00:13:29,753
- J. - J.

400
00:13:29,754 --> 00:13:31,929
"Jee" thinks he's a comedian or whatnot.

401
00:13:32,114 --> 00:13:35,929
He was acting all pretentious.

402
00:13:36,524 --> 00:13:38,324
- "Pretentious"? - S.

403
00:13:38,325 --> 00:13:39,670
- S. - S.

404
00:13:39,764 --> 00:13:43,140
Seok Jin. You're not a comedian.

405
00:13:43,264 --> 00:13:44,694
- He sounds like a drunk. - J.

406
00:13:44,695 --> 00:13:46,540
(It's a poem by a drunk, not a man with a dialect.)

407
00:13:47,004 --> 00:13:48,709
Join another industry before it's too late.

408
00:13:50,305 --> 00:13:52,733
(You should've quit being a comedian long ago.)

409
00:13:52,734 --> 00:13:54,544
(The 54-year-old comedian is knocked out.)

410
00:13:54,545 --> 00:13:55,819
Are you drunk?

411
00:13:56,244 --> 00:13:57,773
- Hey. - Are you drunk?

412
00:13:57,774 --> 00:13:59,650
You should've changed your profession long ago.

413
00:13:59,984 --> 00:14:02,120
Jae Seok. Don't try to win with your quantity.

414
00:14:02,744 --> 00:14:03,983
I'll do one with Kwang Soo's name.

415
00:14:03,984 --> 00:14:05,653
- You have one for him too? - Kwang Soo.

416
00:14:05,654 --> 00:14:08,084
- My gosh, he's a master. - I'll do one with his name.

417
00:14:08,085 --> 00:14:09,084
- L. - L.

418
00:14:09,085 --> 00:14:10,400
Lost your tooth?

419
00:14:11,455 --> 00:14:13,439
- K. - Kwang Soo.

420
00:14:13,665 --> 00:14:14,870
- S. - S.

421
00:14:14,894 --> 00:14:18,309
(Will he be able to wrap up his poem well this time?)

422
00:14:18,364 --> 00:14:21,964
Soo Bin is your girlfriend, right?

423
00:14:21,965 --> 00:14:23,280
Who's Soo Bin?

424
00:14:23,634 --> 00:14:26,844
(Is his girlfriend's name "Soo Bin" using the dialect?)

425
00:14:26,845 --> 00:14:28,574
Who's Soo Bin? Who is she?

426
00:14:28,575 --> 00:14:30,050
(You'd better clear this up. She'll get the wrong idea.)

427
00:14:30,614 --> 00:14:31,814
Who is she?

428
00:14:31,815 --> 00:14:33,444
(Jae Seok is number 1 when it comes to bold poems.)

429
00:14:33,445 --> 00:14:34,990
- This is hilarious. - Soo Bin?

430
00:14:35,014 --> 00:14:36,689
- I think he got the wrong name. - I'm sorry.

431
00:14:36,715 --> 00:14:38,214
- I'm sorry. - Not yet.

432
00:14:38,215 --> 00:14:41,359
- I'm sorry. - Old men often get the names wrong.

433
00:14:41,384 --> 00:14:43,170
- Jong Kook. - Jong Kook should go next.

434
00:14:43,325 --> 00:14:44,594
What should I do?

435
00:14:44,595 --> 00:14:46,253
- I'll go with... - That was so funny.

436
00:14:46,254 --> 00:14:50,040
- Min Si's name. - Min Si's name.

437
00:14:50,065 --> 00:14:51,740
- Min Si's name. - G.

438
00:14:52,264 --> 00:14:55,003
Gosh, what is your name?

439
00:14:55,004 --> 00:14:57,474
(Gosh, what is your name?)

440
00:14:57,475 --> 00:14:59,773
(He starts the poem with a heart-melting line.)

441
00:14:59,774 --> 00:15:01,679
- He's going for the romantic vibe. - That was heart-fluttering.

442
00:15:02,004 --> 00:15:03,189
- M. - M.

443
00:15:03,744 --> 00:15:05,714
Min Si... Was that your name?

444
00:15:05,715 --> 00:15:07,089
"Was that your name?"

445
00:15:07,685 --> 00:15:08,890
- S. - S.

446
00:15:09,045 --> 00:15:11,290
Spare me some of your time for a cup of tea.

447
00:15:12,955 --> 00:15:16,724
(Do you want to have a cup of tea, Min Si?)

448
00:15:16,725 --> 00:15:18,523
My gosh, you've still got it!

449
00:15:18,524 --> 00:15:19,699
(You're a man!)

450
00:15:19,965 --> 00:15:21,594
(Approaching)

451
00:15:21,595 --> 00:15:22,839
Why?

452
00:15:22,994 --> 00:15:24,609
Why are you teasing me?

453
00:15:24,764 --> 00:15:27,733
- Jong Kook, you still got it! - Okay.

454
00:15:27,734 --> 00:15:29,540
It's been a while since he had a love interest.

455
00:15:30,374 --> 00:15:31,750
Her reaction was great.

456
00:15:32,335 --> 00:15:34,849
- This isn't "Mom's Diary". - "Mom's Diary".

457
00:15:35,575 --> 00:15:37,613
- All right. You can evaluate them. - Okay.

458
00:15:37,614 --> 00:15:38,674
We do?

459
00:15:38,675 --> 00:15:39,944
1, 2, 3.

460
00:15:39,945 --> 00:15:41,513
(They need to pick the better one.)

461
00:15:41,514 --> 00:15:45,414
(Who gave the better acrostic poem?)

462
00:15:45,415 --> 00:15:47,660
- Go Min Si! - Oh, Go Min Si?

463
00:15:48,124 --> 00:15:50,224
(He's greatly disappointed.)

464
00:15:50,225 --> 00:15:51,993
You shouldn't have kept your hopes up.

465
00:15:51,994 --> 00:15:54,069
- Were you anticipating? - Why do you look so lost?

466
00:15:54,425 --> 00:15:56,194
It's neither of you two.

467
00:15:56,195 --> 00:15:57,993
- I'm flabbergasted. - Goodness.

468
00:15:57,994 --> 00:15:59,094
Fine.

469
00:15:59,095 --> 00:16:00,233
What does she need to do?

470
00:16:00,234 --> 00:16:02,164
She can pick one of you as her teammate.

471
00:16:02,165 --> 00:16:03,773
He'll probably pick Jong Kook.

472
00:16:03,774 --> 00:16:05,979
- Min Si. - We don't know.

473
00:16:06,075 --> 00:16:07,344
They're anticipating.

474
00:16:07,345 --> 00:16:08,344
(Whom will she pick?)

475
00:16:08,345 --> 00:16:09,550
It must be a dilemma.

476
00:16:09,604 --> 00:16:11,143
I bet she already made a decision.

477
00:16:11,144 --> 00:16:12,414
(Will she choose a romantic partner or more screen time?)

478
00:16:12,415 --> 00:16:13,790
I pick...

479
00:16:14,185 --> 00:16:15,920
- Jong Kook. - Okay!

480
00:16:17,014 --> 00:16:20,253
(She picks Jong Kook.)

481
00:16:20,254 --> 00:16:21,400
Thank you.

482
00:16:21,825 --> 00:16:23,324
- I knew it. - That's great.

483
00:16:23,325 --> 00:16:26,569
- We meet again. - Right.

484
00:16:26,695 --> 00:16:28,270
This is great.

485
00:16:28,965 --> 00:16:31,393
The next category is dance.

486
00:16:31,394 --> 00:16:32,763
- Dance? - Dance?

487
00:16:32,764 --> 00:16:34,740
- Nice. - That's terrible.

488
00:16:35,205 --> 00:16:38,133
This time, it's Ji Hyo and So Min.

489
00:16:38,134 --> 00:16:39,873
- This is painful. - They're back.

490
00:16:39,874 --> 00:16:43,074
We will play some songs randomly.

491
00:16:43,075 --> 00:16:46,589
One person will dance at a time, and the best dancer wins.

492
00:16:46,614 --> 00:16:48,760
Shall we start with the guests?

493
00:16:48,784 --> 00:16:50,414
- Shall we? - Do they all have to do it?

494
00:16:50,415 --> 00:16:52,089
We all have to dance?

495
00:16:52,614 --> 00:16:54,184
My gosh.

496
00:16:54,185 --> 00:16:55,900
I'm terrible at dancing.

497
00:16:56,325 --> 00:16:58,400
- Oh, no. - She's nervous.

498
00:16:59,124 --> 00:17:01,263
(They're shooting right now.)

499
00:17:01,264 --> 00:17:02,393
She's so laidback.

500
00:17:02,394 --> 00:17:04,510
(But she acts comfortably in front of the camera.)

501
00:17:04,894 --> 00:17:06,733
- She is. - She is.

502
00:17:06,734 --> 00:17:08,834
- Every time she moves, - She was officially recruited.

503
00:17:08,835 --> 00:17:10,434
I smell leather.

504
00:17:10,435 --> 00:17:12,579
(Every time she moves, I smell leather.)

505
00:17:13,774 --> 00:17:16,319
- Really? - It smells really strong.

506
00:17:16,445 --> 00:17:17,944
He's right.

507
00:17:17,945 --> 00:17:20,944
- All right. - Who will go first?

508
00:17:20,945 --> 00:17:22,013
This time,

509
00:17:22,014 --> 00:17:23,589
- you should go first. - I'll go.

510
00:17:23,984 --> 00:17:26,053
- Give me some music. - Give her some music.

511
00:17:26,054 --> 00:17:27,083
Don't you have any?

512
00:17:27,084 --> 00:17:28,823
She was on "Love Letter" before.

513
00:17:28,824 --> 00:17:30,930
- Right. - She's experienced.

514
00:17:31,225 --> 00:17:33,224
- What is this? - "Single Ladies".

515
00:17:33,225 --> 00:17:34,964
This is such an old song.

516
00:17:34,965 --> 00:17:36,694
I don't know how to dance to this.

517
00:17:36,695 --> 00:17:38,669
- I'll go. - Really? Gosh.

518
00:17:39,195 --> 00:17:40,879
(Min Si intercepts.)

519
00:17:41,234 --> 00:17:43,379
- Min Si. - She's amazing.

520
00:17:43,774 --> 00:17:46,104
(She transforms.)

521
00:17:46,105 --> 00:17:48,379
(It's Min Si's time.)

522
00:17:49,915 --> 00:17:51,474
She's good.

523
00:17:51,475 --> 00:17:53,013
(She moves her hips.)

524
00:17:53,014 --> 00:17:55,119
- She's good. - Look at her.

525
00:17:55,185 --> 00:17:57,614
She wanted to brag.

526
00:17:57,615 --> 00:17:58,614
(I'm the best dancer.)

527
00:17:58,615 --> 00:18:00,253
She wanted to brag.

528
00:18:00,254 --> 00:18:02,399
- She's like So Min. - She's the type...

529
00:18:02,824 --> 00:18:06,000
who'll brag about her talents.

530
00:18:07,925 --> 00:18:10,169
(The music changes.)

531
00:18:10,195 --> 00:18:13,510
They used to play these songs at the club back in the day.

532
00:18:13,804 --> 00:18:15,533
(She tries again.)

533
00:18:15,534 --> 00:18:17,909
- The songs are difficult. - She's good.

534
00:18:17,935 --> 00:18:20,303
- She's a good dancer. - You're right.

535
00:18:20,304 --> 00:18:21,303
Right?

536
00:18:21,304 --> 00:18:23,889
(The leather jacket lady grabs their attention.)

537
00:18:24,645 --> 00:18:26,313
Dance to the song.

538
00:18:26,314 --> 00:18:28,884
(Here comes the leather jacket lady.)

539
00:18:28,885 --> 00:18:30,129
Gosh, Bo Ra.

540
00:18:30,615 --> 00:18:32,384
- Gosh, Bo Ra. - Look at her.

541
00:18:32,385 --> 00:18:33,783
- We can't beat her. - What's up with your mouth?

542
00:18:33,784 --> 00:18:35,684
She wasn't always like this.

543
00:18:35,685 --> 00:18:38,829
- I can't beat her. - What's up with her mouth?

544
00:18:39,054 --> 00:18:41,700
(She's brazen.)

545
00:18:41,794 --> 00:18:44,333
- Good job. - What's up with her mouth?

546
00:18:44,334 --> 00:18:45,940
How can we beat her?

547
00:18:46,334 --> 00:18:47,733
(It's a more upbeat song.)

548
00:18:47,734 --> 00:18:48,803
(She's on a roll.)

549
00:18:48,804 --> 00:18:50,033
Hold on.

550
00:18:50,034 --> 00:18:51,510
What's wrong with your mouth?

551
00:18:51,804 --> 00:18:53,104
Why do you keep pouting?

552
00:18:53,105 --> 00:18:55,780
- She looks so annoying. - She's so brazen.

553
00:18:55,975 --> 00:18:57,644
She's so brazen.

554
00:18:57,645 --> 00:18:59,474
- Look at how brazen she is. - You're the best.

555
00:18:59,475 --> 00:19:00,914
- Look at her. - My gosh.

556
00:19:00,915 --> 00:19:02,414
(She gave it her best.)

557
00:19:02,415 --> 00:19:03,614
Who's next?

558
00:19:03,615 --> 00:19:05,854
(It's a children's song.)

559
00:19:05,855 --> 00:19:07,430
How do I dance to this?

560
00:19:08,284 --> 00:19:10,069
(Let me show you.)

561
00:19:10,955 --> 00:19:12,624
(She performs a cute dance.)

562
00:19:12,625 --> 00:19:13,694
- 1, 2, 3. - Good.

563
00:19:13,695 --> 00:19:15,793
Her dance skills have improved.

564
00:19:15,794 --> 00:19:17,993
They have improved. She can choreograph her dance moves.

565
00:19:17,994 --> 00:19:20,309
So Min, what are you doing?

566
00:19:20,635 --> 00:19:22,134
(She feels competitive.)

567
00:19:22,135 --> 00:19:24,409
So Min, what are you doing?

568
00:19:24,605 --> 00:19:26,180
My gosh.

569
00:19:26,744 --> 00:19:28,079
I can't stand her.

570
00:19:28,145 --> 00:19:30,849
Who dances like that to children's songs?

571
00:19:31,445 --> 00:19:33,520
This song is for children!

572
00:19:33,945 --> 00:19:35,859
- My gosh. - That's so provocative!

573
00:19:36,044 --> 00:19:38,159
- Ji Hyo is shocked too. - My gosh.

574
00:19:38,685 --> 00:19:40,583
I'm astonished.

575
00:19:40,584 --> 00:19:41,954
What's wrong with you?

576
00:19:41,955 --> 00:19:43,593
Dream watches our show!

577
00:19:43,594 --> 00:19:45,753
(My son watches this show!)

578
00:19:45,754 --> 00:19:48,194
(For now, it's a show for adults.)

579
00:19:48,195 --> 00:19:50,493
- My gosh. - I can't believe her.

580
00:19:50,494 --> 00:19:51,793
(Flip the channel for a minute, Dream.)

581
00:19:51,794 --> 00:19:53,733
What's wrong with you?

582
00:19:53,734 --> 00:19:55,409
Go inside.

583
00:19:56,334 --> 00:19:58,309
- Go. - What are you doing?

584
00:19:58,504 --> 00:20:00,404
(She never listens.)

585
00:20:00,405 --> 00:20:02,220
- Go. - Go away!

586
00:20:02,344 --> 00:20:03,843
(He's afraid.)

587
00:20:03,844 --> 00:20:06,783
- What is she doing? - I said, go away.

588
00:20:06,784 --> 00:20:08,184
(I am the sexiest dancer.)

589
00:20:08,185 --> 00:20:10,230
The most annoying part was...

590
00:20:10,355 --> 00:20:12,083
not only her dance but when she did this.

591
00:20:12,084 --> 00:20:13,829
(She sang, "knock, knock".)

592
00:20:14,425 --> 00:20:17,270
- It was so annoying. - She said she's so sexy.

593
00:20:17,455 --> 00:20:19,470
I know how that feels.

594
00:20:19,695 --> 00:20:21,124
I was so sexy.

595
00:20:21,125 --> 00:20:23,634
I think there are two people who were good.

596
00:20:23,635 --> 00:20:25,710
- You're right. - I was amazed at Bo Ra.

597
00:20:25,734 --> 00:20:27,563
Please evaluate them.

598
00:20:27,564 --> 00:20:28,934
(Whoever gets the majority of the picks wins.)

599
00:20:28,935 --> 00:20:31,450
I feel like So Min did better.

600
00:20:31,774 --> 00:20:33,843
- Pick Bo Ra. - Okay.

601
00:20:33,844 --> 00:20:34,974
Okay.

602
00:20:34,975 --> 00:20:36,644
- I knew it'd be her. - Pick between her...

603
00:20:36,645 --> 00:20:38,043
- and So Min. - Okay.

604
00:20:38,044 --> 00:20:40,243
- She was invincible. - So Min was just doing her job.

605
00:20:40,244 --> 00:20:41,944
(So Min was just doing her job.)

606
00:20:41,945 --> 00:20:42,944
Right.

607
00:20:42,945 --> 00:20:44,313
Isn't she an actress.

608
00:20:44,314 --> 00:20:45,354
- No, she isn't. - I was working.

609
00:20:45,355 --> 00:20:47,724
- I was working. - She was.

610
00:20:47,725 --> 00:20:49,753
- Bo Ra. - Let's shout it out.

611
00:20:49,754 --> 00:20:51,493
- 1, 2, 3. - Bo Ra!

612
00:20:51,494 --> 00:20:53,394
(Bo Ra wins.)

613
00:20:53,395 --> 00:20:54,800
Thank you.

614
00:20:54,895 --> 00:20:56,800
- Do I pick? - Yes, between those two.

615
00:20:57,135 --> 00:20:58,563
I pick So Min.

616
00:20:58,564 --> 00:21:01,839
(She picks So Min.)

617
00:21:02,105 --> 00:21:03,704
- She picked someone similar. - She did.

618
00:21:03,705 --> 00:21:05,379
The dancing queens have met.

619
00:21:05,475 --> 00:21:07,144
- Goodness. - They're similar to each other.

620
00:21:07,145 --> 00:21:09,280
- She always picks someone similar. - I see.

621
00:21:09,304 --> 00:21:11,419
It'd be chaotic if both of them danced.

622
00:21:11,544 --> 00:21:13,013
- Let's watch. - Can we...

623
00:21:13,014 --> 00:21:14,583
watch them dance?

624
00:21:14,584 --> 00:21:15,843
To children's songs.

625
00:21:15,844 --> 00:21:17,260
Dancing is the way to go.

626
00:21:17,554 --> 00:21:19,654
They'll definitely win all dancing matches for the day.

627
00:21:19,655 --> 00:21:20,753
Here we go.

628
00:21:20,754 --> 00:21:22,129
This is a celebratory dance.

629
00:21:22,355 --> 00:21:23,493
This is a celebratory dance.

630
00:21:23,494 --> 00:21:24,993
- A celebratory dance? - Are we dancing?

631
00:21:24,994 --> 00:21:27,740
- I can't wait to find out. - How sexy will they be?

632
00:21:28,195 --> 00:21:30,864
(Shall we start off cute?)

633
00:21:30,865 --> 00:21:33,780
(She refuses.)

634
00:21:35,435 --> 00:21:37,280
Look at her mouth.

635
00:21:37,435 --> 00:21:38,780
(Everyone is fixated on her.)

636
00:21:39,274 --> 00:21:40,503
(They're on fire.)

637
00:21:40,504 --> 00:21:42,250
Why are you following her?

638
00:21:42,675 --> 00:21:43,843
- Wait. - My gosh.

639
00:21:43,844 --> 00:21:45,990
- What's wrong with her mouth? - What's going on?

640
00:21:46,014 --> 00:21:48,214
That's enough. Stop the music.

641
00:21:48,215 --> 00:21:49,243
(They refuse to calm down.)

642
00:21:49,244 --> 00:21:51,389
That's enough. Go back.

643
00:21:51,885 --> 00:21:53,313
What's wrong with your mouth?

644
00:21:53,314 --> 00:21:54,724
Both of them...

645
00:21:54,725 --> 00:21:57,354
start dancing with their faces.

646
00:21:57,355 --> 00:21:58,993
(Their facial expressions do most of the work.)

647
00:21:58,994 --> 00:22:01,293
- That was hilarious! - They looked...

648
00:22:01,294 --> 00:22:03,763
- They looked so content. - My gosh!

649
00:22:03,764 --> 00:22:06,040
- They're the worst. - She wasn't like this before.

650
00:22:06,594 --> 00:22:08,063
So this is how she is now.

651
00:22:08,064 --> 00:22:10,040
- She was always like this. - Really?

652
00:22:10,734 --> 00:22:13,033
(Min Si picks Seok Jin, and Bo Ra picks Haha.)

653
00:22:13,034 --> 00:22:14,144
Isn't that a bad thing?

654
00:22:14,145 --> 00:22:15,619
- Really? It's bad? - Yes.

655
00:22:15,675 --> 00:22:18,319
This category is trivial tricks.

656
00:22:18,344 --> 00:22:21,214
Min Si told me...

657
00:22:21,215 --> 00:22:23,990
that she could open a bottle with her toes.

658
00:22:24,014 --> 00:22:25,783
With her toes?

659
00:22:25,784 --> 00:22:28,124
I'm sure the bottle can be opened easily.

660
00:22:28,125 --> 00:22:30,000
- Maybe you need to turn the cap. - Is it a can?

661
00:22:30,425 --> 00:22:32,124
(These are real glass bottles.)

662
00:22:32,125 --> 00:22:34,399
- With a bottle opener. - Oh, I see.

663
00:22:34,494 --> 00:22:35,924
Gosh, how many is that?

664
00:22:35,925 --> 00:22:37,164
- How is that possible? - My toes will cramp up.

665
00:22:37,165 --> 00:22:39,664
- My toes are naturally... - How is this possible?

666
00:22:39,665 --> 00:22:41,233
- very strong. - That's true.

667
00:22:41,234 --> 00:22:42,809
He's right.

668
00:22:42,905 --> 00:22:45,503
If Kwang Soo is going to do it,

669
00:22:45,504 --> 00:22:47,079
- you need to censor it. - Why?

670
00:22:47,605 --> 00:22:49,573
- Why? - His toes are rotten.

671
00:22:49,574 --> 00:22:50,714
(He exposes a secret.)

672
00:22:50,715 --> 00:22:51,813
- They're not. - Really?

673
00:22:51,814 --> 00:22:54,144
- Yes, they are. - No, don't be ridiculous.

674
00:22:54,145 --> 00:22:55,714
- Really? Let me see. - His big toe is rotten.

675
00:22:55,715 --> 00:22:57,313
There's nothing to see. It's not rotten.

676
00:22:57,314 --> 00:22:59,790
(This is the story behind his toes.)

677
00:23:00,355 --> 00:23:02,684
(His best friend, Gook Ju, confirmed it.)

678
00:23:02,685 --> 00:23:04,194
It's just injured!

679
00:23:04,195 --> 00:23:06,270
(They mistook his bruised toe as rotten.)

680
00:23:06,455 --> 00:23:08,323
It looks like moss growing on a tree.

681
00:23:08,324 --> 00:23:10,270
I suddenly don't like him too much.

682
00:23:10,294 --> 00:23:11,694
It's not rotten.

683
00:23:11,695 --> 00:23:12,793
I suddenly don't like him too much.

684
00:23:12,794 --> 00:23:14,503
(She doesn't like him.)

685
00:23:14,504 --> 00:23:16,079
- It's not rotten. - I suddenly changed my mind.

686
00:23:16,234 --> 00:23:18,579
Gosh, he really turned me off.

687
00:23:18,675 --> 00:23:20,073
It's not rotten.

688
00:23:20,074 --> 00:23:22,149
- He's using full care for it. - It's not like that.

689
00:23:22,304 --> 00:23:24,513
- It was bruised. - He's using full care.

690
00:23:24,514 --> 00:23:26,773
- What? - "Full care"?

691
00:23:26,774 --> 00:23:28,214
- It's not true. - What's the name of that ointment?

692
00:23:28,215 --> 00:23:29,884
- The full care is doing him well. - It's not rotten.

693
00:23:29,885 --> 00:23:31,559
- Foot care. - Foot care.

694
00:23:31,754 --> 00:23:33,253
- Is it foot care? - Foot care.

695
00:23:33,254 --> 00:23:34,659
What's "full care" then?

696
00:23:34,984 --> 00:23:36,083
My gosh.

697
00:23:36,084 --> 00:23:38,553
Whoever opens the most bottles in a minute wins.

698
00:23:38,554 --> 00:23:40,000
How do you do it?

699
00:23:40,665 --> 00:23:42,563
How do you open it?

700
00:23:42,564 --> 00:23:45,194
She practiced this at home.

701
00:23:45,195 --> 00:23:46,934
- That's right. - No, I haven't.

702
00:23:46,935 --> 00:23:48,063
Get ready.

703
00:23:48,064 --> 00:23:49,680
- Set... - Go.

704
00:23:49,705 --> 00:23:50,849
It works.

705
00:23:51,605 --> 00:23:52,874
(The bottle makes a refreshing sound.)

706
00:23:52,875 --> 00:23:54,280
- It works. - No way.

707
00:23:54,875 --> 00:23:55,974
(The master is here.)

708
00:23:55,975 --> 00:23:57,149
Keep going.

709
00:23:57,875 --> 00:23:59,174
She's so strange.

710
00:23:59,175 --> 00:24:00,243
(Why is she so good?)

711
00:24:00,244 --> 00:24:02,419
- How is she so good? - This isn't a useful skill.

712
00:24:02,584 --> 00:24:04,053
- Five. - How much time is left?

713
00:24:04,054 --> 00:24:06,083
- Ten seconds. - What?

714
00:24:06,084 --> 00:24:08,523
- Eight. - It's not easy to grab onto it.

715
00:24:08,524 --> 00:24:09,823
This should be on "What on Earth!"

716
00:24:09,824 --> 00:24:11,770
You're right.

717
00:24:12,125 --> 00:24:13,553
(She opens them easily.)

718
00:24:13,554 --> 00:24:14,864
- 10 bottles. - 10 bottles.

719
00:24:14,865 --> 00:24:15,970
She opened 10 bottles.

720
00:24:16,865 --> 00:24:18,210
It's 1 every 10 seconds.

721
00:24:18,734 --> 00:24:20,409
- It's 1 every 10 seconds. - How is she so good?

722
00:24:20,435 --> 00:24:21,839
That was quick.

723
00:24:21,965 --> 00:24:24,349
- Next up is Kwang Soo. - I have trust in you.

724
00:24:24,435 --> 00:24:25,879
Let me see your big toe.

725
00:24:26,334 --> 00:24:28,243
(His foot is revealed.)

726
00:24:28,244 --> 00:24:30,319
No, no.

727
00:24:31,175 --> 00:24:32,944
- No, it's not rotten. - Let me see it.

728
00:24:32,945 --> 00:24:34,290
I injured it.

729
00:24:34,344 --> 00:24:35,983
No, it's not rotten.

730
00:24:35,984 --> 00:24:37,430
Let me see it.

731
00:24:38,215 --> 00:24:40,354
- Good. - You got a pedicure.

732
00:24:40,355 --> 00:24:42,053
This isn't embarrassing. It's not rotten.

733
00:24:42,054 --> 00:24:43,083
(He's embarrassed to show it.)

734
00:24:43,084 --> 00:24:44,700
You look so embarrassed.

735
00:24:46,195 --> 00:24:47,364
Here we go.

736
00:24:47,365 --> 00:24:49,323
Get ready, set...

737
00:24:49,324 --> 00:24:50,409
(His rotten toe is on the line.)

738
00:24:50,564 --> 00:24:52,464
- Your toe is too close. - Don't use your hand.

739
00:24:52,465 --> 00:24:54,763
- It shouldn't be close up. - It should be far.

740
00:24:54,764 --> 00:24:57,434
- Grab it from a distance. - Grab it from a distance.

741
00:24:57,435 --> 00:24:59,680
Good. You'll get more force that way. Good.

742
00:25:01,105 --> 00:25:02,573
Hurry up!

743
00:25:02,574 --> 00:25:03,944
(Jae Seok is slow.)

744
00:25:03,945 --> 00:25:05,614
Hurry up!

745
00:25:05,615 --> 00:25:06,874
- Put it over it. - We should copy him.

746
00:25:06,875 --> 00:25:08,059
That's good.

747
00:25:10,185 --> 00:25:11,790
What's wrong with you?

748
00:25:12,115 --> 00:25:14,323
What? I'm handing it over to you.

749
00:25:14,324 --> 00:25:15,430
That's good.

750
00:25:17,125 --> 00:25:19,053
(Screaming)

751
00:25:19,054 --> 00:25:20,624
(He's busy.)

752
00:25:20,625 --> 00:25:21,894
(He's so hilarious.)

753
00:25:21,895 --> 00:25:23,399
- That's good. Put it over. - He's so funny!

754
00:25:24,935 --> 00:25:26,093
There's no more.

755
00:25:26,094 --> 00:25:29,263
(There's no more.)

756
00:25:29,264 --> 00:25:30,809
It's behind you!

757
00:25:31,405 --> 00:25:32,503
Really?

758
00:25:32,504 --> 00:25:34,243
(Why is he in a hurry?)

759
00:25:34,244 --> 00:25:36,220
- Get one more open. - It's going well.

760
00:25:36,504 --> 00:25:38,214
That's too bad.

761
00:25:38,215 --> 00:25:39,990
- Right. - That was close.

762
00:25:40,715 --> 00:25:42,614
- Unbelievable. - You did well though.

763
00:25:42,615 --> 00:25:44,159
- But... - Here we go.

764
00:25:44,484 --> 00:25:46,389
- Ready... - Ready, set...

765
00:25:47,014 --> 00:25:49,099
Why is he holding it that way?

766
00:25:49,324 --> 00:25:51,124
(Pop!)

767
00:25:51,125 --> 00:25:52,430
(A clear sound)

768
00:25:53,425 --> 00:25:55,069
Is it easier that way?

769
00:25:55,294 --> 00:25:56,793
(His foot is faster than his hand.)

770
00:25:56,794 --> 00:25:57,869
Gosh.

771
00:25:58,094 --> 00:25:59,270
He's so good at this.

772
00:25:59,294 --> 00:26:00,404
It seems so natural.

773
00:26:00,405 --> 00:26:03,104
Could the sound be any more appetizing?

774
00:26:03,105 --> 00:26:04,333
(100 percent automated system)

775
00:26:04,334 --> 00:26:05,874
- He doesn't even need his hands. - No way.

776
00:26:05,875 --> 00:26:07,343
My gosh.

777
00:26:07,344 --> 00:26:09,043
Can you believe this?

778
00:26:09,044 --> 00:26:11,349
(A human conveyor belt)

779
00:26:12,175 --> 00:26:13,914
(Yang Se Chan, factory worker)

780
00:26:13,915 --> 00:26:15,144
Go, Se Chan!

781
00:26:15,145 --> 00:26:17,013
It's as if he's using his hands.

782
00:26:17,014 --> 00:26:18,954
Can you get me 10 more bottles?

783
00:26:18,955 --> 00:26:20,983
(He has already popped all the allocated bottles.)

784
00:26:20,984 --> 00:26:23,083
(The factory is on a roll!)

785
00:26:23,084 --> 00:26:25,169
- Hurry! - I can't believe this.

786
00:26:25,254 --> 00:26:26,624
He's so good at this.

787
00:26:26,625 --> 00:26:28,399
Just like that. Exactly.

788
00:26:29,125 --> 00:26:30,394
Are you done?

789
00:26:30,395 --> 00:26:31,593
That was 37 seconds.

790
00:26:31,594 --> 00:26:32,669
(Anyone can tell that he won.)

791
00:26:32,794 --> 00:26:35,079
(He popped 10 bottles in 37 seconds.)

792
00:26:35,135 --> 00:26:37,033
You might be able to pop about 18 bottles.

793
00:26:37,034 --> 00:26:38,134
(He should get a medallion for his performance.)

794
00:26:38,135 --> 00:26:40,233
- That was amazing. - You were great.

795
00:26:40,234 --> 00:26:41,944
- That was awesome. - Se Chan...

796
00:26:41,945 --> 00:26:44,343
This is what you call talent.

797
00:26:44,344 --> 00:26:48,083
Se Chan, you can choose your team.

798
00:26:48,084 --> 00:26:49,190
I...

799
00:26:50,685 --> 00:26:52,159
choose Team Bo Ra.

800
00:26:53,084 --> 00:26:55,323
(Se Chan joins Team Bo Ra.)

801
00:26:55,324 --> 00:26:56,530
Right.

802
00:26:56,685 --> 00:26:57,724
You still have it.

803
00:26:57,725 --> 00:26:59,023
So you chose to be with your girlfriend.

804
00:26:59,024 --> 00:27:00,924
Come on.

805
00:27:00,925 --> 00:27:01,924
You chose your girlfriend.

806
00:27:01,925 --> 00:27:03,169
(Gosh, I almost took her hand.)

807
00:27:03,195 --> 00:27:04,639
Gosh, I almost took her hand.

808
00:27:05,465 --> 00:27:06,833
I almost responded.

809
00:27:06,834 --> 00:27:09,033
- Why didn't you take it? - That's not it.

810
00:27:09,034 --> 00:27:11,204
- It's not what you think. - My gosh.

811
00:27:11,205 --> 00:27:13,503
No, not like that. Take my hand like this.

812
00:27:13,504 --> 00:27:15,904
(Clasp our fingers together.)

813
00:27:15,905 --> 00:27:17,944
Let me go over the rules again.

814
00:27:17,945 --> 00:27:20,343
If the thieves are on one team,

815
00:27:20,344 --> 00:27:22,889
the hidden missions so far will be null and void.

816
00:27:22,984 --> 00:27:24,354
If the thieves are on different teams,

817
00:27:24,355 --> 00:27:27,089
they will have stolen the gold bars from others.

818
00:27:27,155 --> 00:27:29,354
It also means that the hidden missions were carried out.

819
00:27:29,355 --> 00:27:31,624
If the thieves are on the same team,

820
00:27:31,625 --> 00:27:32,924
- one will want to switch teams. - Okay.

821
00:27:32,925 --> 00:27:34,924
- Right. - So let me reveal...

822
00:27:34,925 --> 00:27:37,664
the total number of gold bars that the thieves have.

823
00:27:37,665 --> 00:27:39,740
- The thieves started off with zero. - Right.

824
00:27:39,834 --> 00:27:42,563
They win if they end up with more than 10.

825
00:27:42,564 --> 00:27:46,134
All right. The number of gold bars that the thieves currently have...

826
00:27:46,135 --> 00:27:50,043
(The number of gold bars that the thieves currently have...)

827
00:27:50,044 --> 00:27:51,073
They have four.

828
00:27:51,074 --> 00:27:53,214
(They have four.)

829
00:27:53,215 --> 00:27:55,020
- What? - So they succeeded four times?

830
00:27:55,484 --> 00:27:56,760
They have four.

831
00:27:57,145 --> 00:27:59,114
- Hold on. - I think it's Se Chan.

832
00:27:59,115 --> 00:28:01,154
It has to be. It's Se Chan.

833
00:28:01,155 --> 00:28:02,583
- I'm 100 percent sure. - Me too.

834
00:28:02,584 --> 00:28:04,224
- These two. - Hold on a second.

835
00:28:04,225 --> 00:28:06,224
Do they steal one gold bar per hidden mission?

836
00:28:06,225 --> 00:28:07,523
- Yes, 1. - Yes, 1 for 1.

837
00:28:07,524 --> 00:28:09,270
- So they succeeded four times. - Kwang Soo...

838
00:28:09,625 --> 00:28:11,063
punched Jae Seok in the stomach a few times.

839
00:28:11,064 --> 00:28:12,093
The dialect Jae Seok spoke in...

840
00:28:12,094 --> 00:28:14,063
How many times did Kwang Soo punch his stomach?

841
00:28:14,064 --> 00:28:15,740
- I counted four. - Wait, that's...

842
00:28:16,105 --> 00:28:18,803
(Was punching Jae Seok's stomach a hidden mission?)

843
00:28:18,804 --> 00:28:20,950
- No way... - That could've been it.

844
00:28:21,145 --> 00:28:24,144
(Is Haha trying to frame Kwang Soo or has Kwang Soo been caught?)

845
00:28:24,145 --> 00:28:26,089
It doesn't mean that one thief succeeded four times.

846
00:28:26,115 --> 00:28:27,843
- It was split. - The 2 thieves did it 4 times.

847
00:28:27,844 --> 00:28:30,013
It could be 2 and 2 or 3 and 1.

848
00:28:30,014 --> 00:28:31,313
One thief could've succeeded four times as well.

849
00:28:31,314 --> 00:28:32,389
(The thieves could've collectively carried out the missions.)

850
00:28:33,885 --> 00:28:36,583
Who did the most missions? It was Jae Seok.

851
00:28:36,584 --> 00:28:37,624
- What do you mean? - You did the most.

852
00:28:37,625 --> 00:28:38,993
You spoke all the dialects.

853
00:28:38,994 --> 00:28:41,424
- You're right! - Jae Seok...

854
00:28:41,425 --> 00:28:43,224
- He's right. - It can be Jae Seok.

855
00:28:43,225 --> 00:28:45,093
He kept speaking in a dialect.

856
00:28:45,094 --> 00:28:48,404
Captain Hwang, you must think this through.

857
00:28:48,405 --> 00:28:49,704
Don't easily jump to conclusions.

858
00:28:49,705 --> 00:28:51,704
But Jae Seok spoke in a lot of dialects.

859
00:28:51,705 --> 00:28:53,204
- Hold on. - Which of the teams...

860
00:28:53,205 --> 00:28:54,944
Min Si, who do you think is the thief?

861
00:28:54,945 --> 00:28:56,243
Who's the most suspicious?

862
00:28:56,244 --> 00:28:58,114
- Out of everyone here... - These two.

863
00:28:58,115 --> 00:29:00,783
- Me? - Then leave them on one team.

864
00:29:00,784 --> 00:29:03,684
They must be on the same team for us to protect our gold bars.

865
00:29:03,685 --> 00:29:04,813
Put them on one team.

866
00:29:04,814 --> 00:29:06,614
Min Si, pick a teammate.

867
00:29:06,615 --> 00:29:07,624
Yes, let's get this over with.

868
00:29:07,625 --> 00:29:09,954
- I choose Se Chan. - Me?

869
00:29:09,955 --> 00:29:10,993
Why?

870
00:29:10,994 --> 00:29:12,399
(Min Si chooses Se Chan!)

871
00:29:12,695 --> 00:29:13,854
- Me? - Why?

872
00:29:13,855 --> 00:29:15,263
- I'm bringing him to my team. - Right.

873
00:29:15,264 --> 00:29:16,293
- I want him on my team. - You don't suspect me, right?

874
00:29:16,294 --> 00:29:17,993
- I don't. - Your choice startled me.

875
00:29:17,994 --> 00:29:19,464
- Who will you kick out? - Then...

876
00:29:19,465 --> 00:29:21,233
I'll kick Seok Jin out.

877
00:29:21,234 --> 00:29:22,704
- Me? - This isn't right.

878
00:29:22,705 --> 00:29:24,303
- What? - Why him?

879
00:29:24,304 --> 00:29:26,233
- There's no reason for this. - Why?

880
00:29:26,234 --> 00:29:27,803
- He's not a thief. - It won't be Seok Jin.

881
00:29:27,804 --> 00:29:29,104
Hear me out.

882
00:29:29,105 --> 00:29:31,214
I don't think he's the thief.

883
00:29:31,215 --> 00:29:32,513
Then I choose Kwang Soo.

884
00:29:32,514 --> 00:29:34,243
- Nice. - Wait, hold on.

885
00:29:34,244 --> 00:29:36,214
You should choose who you think is the thief.

886
00:29:36,215 --> 00:29:37,559
Yes, you.

887
00:29:37,584 --> 00:29:39,583
- Then... - Kwang Soo, get over here.

888
00:29:39,584 --> 00:29:40,854
Am I staying? All right.

889
00:29:40,855 --> 00:29:42,724
- Mr. Thief? - Hold on a second.

890
00:29:42,725 --> 00:29:44,593
- What now? - If Kwang Soo isn't a thief,

891
00:29:44,594 --> 00:29:46,323
then having him will increase our chances of winning games.

892
00:29:46,324 --> 00:29:47,669
- Exactly. - You have a point.

893
00:29:47,865 --> 00:29:49,763
Come on, just make a decision!

894
00:29:49,764 --> 00:29:51,493
(Hurry up and make a decision!)

895
00:29:51,494 --> 00:29:53,040
Seok Jin, wait.

896
00:29:53,195 --> 00:29:54,333
Seriously?

897
00:29:54,334 --> 00:29:57,104
I'm sorry, but can we play this game without him?

898
00:29:57,105 --> 00:29:58,404
Hurry up already!

899
00:29:58,405 --> 00:29:59,503
It's better if he doesn't play.

900
00:29:59,504 --> 00:30:00,674
- Seok Jin, we're sorry. - I'll just follow...

901
00:30:00,675 --> 00:30:01,944
the original decision.

902
00:30:01,945 --> 00:30:03,503
- Having Kwang Soo is better. - It's done, then.

903
00:30:03,504 --> 00:30:04,974
- It's done. - It's been decided.

904
00:30:04,975 --> 00:30:06,043
Okay, it's over.

905
00:30:06,044 --> 00:30:07,783
- Okay. - We have other rounds.

906
00:30:07,784 --> 00:30:10,414
You'll now get changed and begin Round Two.

907
00:30:10,415 --> 00:30:11,914
- Okay. - Nice.

908
00:30:11,915 --> 00:30:13,313
Why do you keep doing this?

909
00:30:13,314 --> 00:30:14,629
Guys, let's go.

910
00:30:14,885 --> 00:30:18,470
Once again, the thieves can carry out their hidden missions.

911
00:30:18,594 --> 00:30:20,964
- Okay. - I should keep my eyes peeled open.

912
00:30:20,965 --> 00:30:22,394
It's hard to see when seated like this.

913
00:30:22,395 --> 00:30:25,194
Round Two is all about the chemistry between teammates.

914
00:30:25,195 --> 00:30:26,493
This is Protect One's Name.

915
00:30:26,494 --> 00:30:27,964
- Protect One's Name? - Does it involve name tags?

916
00:30:27,965 --> 00:30:31,104
- What is it? - Two from each team will compete.

917
00:30:31,105 --> 00:30:34,104
One will head to Gongdeok Station in disguise...

918
00:30:34,105 --> 00:30:36,204
and carry out a mission while having...

919
00:30:36,205 --> 00:30:38,414
their names being called the least.

920
00:30:38,415 --> 00:30:40,319
While wearing a simple disguise?

921
00:30:40,344 --> 00:30:42,243
- Hold on. - You shouldn't get recognized.

922
00:30:42,244 --> 00:30:44,454
- At a subway station? - The team with the member...

923
00:30:44,455 --> 00:30:46,483
who had his or her name called the least wins.

924
00:30:46,484 --> 00:30:48,624
We should make Kwang Soo do it.

925
00:30:48,625 --> 00:30:50,924
It has to be Kwang Soo. He stands out too easily.

926
00:30:50,925 --> 00:30:53,399
- Kwang Soo. - Then we choose Jae Seok.

927
00:30:53,425 --> 00:30:55,200
He can't cover his mouth though.

928
00:30:55,425 --> 00:30:56,424
Don't take off your glasses either.

929
00:30:56,425 --> 00:30:58,293
- You can't ask that. - Why not?

930
00:30:58,294 --> 00:30:59,833
Captain?

931
00:30:59,834 --> 00:31:01,704
Let's choose Jae Seok.

932
00:31:01,705 --> 00:31:04,104
- Jae Seok, yes. - We'll choose Jae Seok.

933
00:31:04,105 --> 00:31:05,773
Okay, it'll be Jae Seok.

934
00:31:05,774 --> 00:31:07,704
- Yes, Jae Seok. - Then the two will be...

935
00:31:07,705 --> 00:31:09,879
- Kwang Soo and... - Jae Seok.

936
00:31:10,145 --> 00:31:11,513
This will be neck and neck.

937
00:31:11,514 --> 00:31:13,313
I'm slightly feeling the pressure though.

938
00:31:13,314 --> 00:31:15,783
- Kwang Soo's height... - Exactly. He's so tall.

939
00:31:15,784 --> 00:31:17,319
(Jae Seok and Kwang Soo are ready to go.)

940
00:31:17,615 --> 00:31:19,089
Hey, it's Jae Seok!

941
00:31:19,484 --> 00:31:20,614
It's Jae Seok.

942
00:31:20,615 --> 00:31:21,760
There's Yu Jae Seok.

943
00:31:21,885 --> 00:31:23,154
- Yu Jae Seok! - It's Jae Seok.

944
00:31:23,155 --> 00:31:24,424
Anyone can tell it's Jae Seok.

945
00:31:24,425 --> 00:31:25,523
I mean...

946
00:31:25,524 --> 00:31:27,023
Are you an idiot?

947
00:31:27,024 --> 00:31:30,093
How is this a decent disguise?

948
00:31:30,094 --> 00:31:32,894
Wait, there's Kwang Soo!

949
00:31:32,895 --> 00:31:34,104
I can't tell if it's him.

950
00:31:34,105 --> 00:31:35,503
You can't be sure it's him.

951
00:31:35,504 --> 00:31:37,573
Kwang Soo looks like a foreigner.

952
00:31:37,574 --> 00:31:39,104
You can't tell, right?

953
00:31:39,105 --> 00:31:40,303
I really can't tell.

954
00:31:40,304 --> 00:31:42,144
- No, it's Kwang Soo for sure. - Your stride gives it away.

955
00:31:42,145 --> 00:31:43,874
Walk with a wilder stride.

956
00:31:43,875 --> 00:31:45,520
Wide and clumpy.

957
00:31:46,074 --> 00:31:47,914
- But... - That's it!

958
00:31:47,915 --> 00:31:49,214
- I can't tell that it's him. - Nice.

959
00:31:49,215 --> 00:31:51,214
Meanwhile, you look exactly like yourself.

960
00:31:51,215 --> 00:31:54,089
Who can grow a mustache like this?

961
00:31:54,355 --> 00:31:56,159
Is it even possible?

962
00:31:56,254 --> 00:31:58,023
I told you to not go too far.

963
00:31:58,024 --> 00:31:59,854
His mustache seems real, but yours doesn't.

964
00:31:59,855 --> 00:32:01,194
No one will recognize me.

965
00:32:01,195 --> 00:32:03,493
- As if. - They won't.

966
00:32:03,494 --> 00:32:06,093
You will now head to Gongdeok Station.

967
00:32:06,094 --> 00:32:07,464
Many who look like this stroll around.

968
00:32:07,465 --> 00:32:09,740
- We're done for. - It's over.

969
00:32:10,365 --> 00:32:12,503
You don't know what your mission is yet.

970
00:32:12,504 --> 00:32:14,604
- Right. - Take these two objects.

971
00:32:14,605 --> 00:32:16,704
A smartphone and a transportation card.

972
00:32:16,705 --> 00:32:17,874
- Okay. - Even a smartphone?

973
00:32:17,875 --> 00:32:21,659
Find the mission in Gongdeok Station and carry it out.

974
00:32:22,044 --> 00:32:24,559
- In Gongdeok Station? - Yes.

975
00:32:25,215 --> 00:32:29,260
We'll count how many times your names get called.

976
00:32:29,784 --> 00:32:32,493
(They head inside Gongdeok Station curious about the mission.)

977
00:32:32,494 --> 00:32:34,240
(A wild stride)

978
00:32:35,895 --> 00:32:37,669
No one recognizes me.

979
00:32:38,665 --> 00:32:39,694
What did I tell you?

980
00:32:39,695 --> 00:32:40,694
(Jae Seok's proud of his disguise.)

981
00:32:40,695 --> 00:32:43,109
(There aren't many people on the way to the station.)

982
00:32:43,405 --> 00:32:44,604
(The two will head to different exits.)

983
00:32:44,605 --> 00:32:46,003
- Jae Seok... - Kwang Soo!

984
00:32:46,004 --> 00:32:47,033
Yes?

985
00:32:47,034 --> 00:32:48,480
(Jae Seok openly yells Kwang Soo's name.)

986
00:32:49,105 --> 00:32:50,104
Jae Seok, good luck.

987
00:32:50,105 --> 00:32:51,190
(Kwang Soo fights back.)

988
00:32:51,744 --> 00:32:54,490
(Luckily, the people didn't hear them.)

989
00:32:55,145 --> 00:32:56,614
(While the two head to Gongdeok Station...)

990
00:32:56,615 --> 00:32:57,783
Do I go in there?

991
00:32:57,784 --> 00:32:59,329
(While the two head to Gongdeok Station...)

992
00:32:59,415 --> 00:33:02,523
The others will play Cham, Cham, Cham.

993
00:33:02,524 --> 00:33:04,124
- All right. - Got it.

994
00:33:04,125 --> 00:33:05,624
(What's with the Cham, Cham, Cham?)

995
00:33:05,625 --> 00:33:07,664
While the two carry out their missions,

996
00:33:07,665 --> 00:33:10,224
you will be playing a game indoors as well.

997
00:33:10,225 --> 00:33:12,394
This is an upgraded version of Cham, Cham, Cham.

998
00:33:12,395 --> 00:33:16,333
A member from each team will play at a time wearing these gloves.

999
00:33:16,334 --> 00:33:18,573
Even though you get slapped,

1000
00:33:18,574 --> 00:33:19,974
if you maintain a smile,

1001
00:33:19,975 --> 00:33:22,043
it'll be counted as a successful defense.

1002
00:33:22,044 --> 00:33:23,644
The winning team will spin the wheel once...

1003
00:33:23,645 --> 00:33:25,243
while the losing team will spin it twice.

1004
00:33:25,244 --> 00:33:29,159
Jae Seok and Kwang Soo must carry out the penalties.

1005
00:33:30,514 --> 00:33:32,214
How about the ladies? Ji Hyo will go first.

1006
00:33:32,215 --> 00:33:33,889
Ji Hyo and Bo Ra then.

1007
00:33:34,385 --> 00:33:35,684
This will be neck and neck.

1008
00:33:35,685 --> 00:33:36,783
- Gosh. - Goodness.

1009
00:33:36,784 --> 00:33:38,829
I'm not good at this game though.

1010
00:33:38,855 --> 00:33:40,253
Grab it tight.

1011
00:33:40,254 --> 00:33:41,624
She's not someone predictable.

1012
00:33:41,625 --> 00:33:42,763
- Her reactions, right? - Yes.

1013
00:33:42,764 --> 00:33:44,293
- Reaction Queen. - Hold on.

1014
00:33:44,294 --> 00:33:46,869
Bo Ra's digging a hole in the foam.

1015
00:33:47,195 --> 00:33:49,934
- Look at her hand. - Is that allowed?

1016
00:33:49,935 --> 00:33:51,773
Her hand will come out at the other end at this rate.

1017
00:33:51,774 --> 00:33:52,904
Do the same thing, Ji Hyo.

1018
00:33:52,905 --> 00:33:54,843
Bo Ra sure is competitive.

1019
00:33:54,844 --> 00:33:56,604
Rock-paper-scissors, guys. With your left hand.

1020
00:33:56,605 --> 00:33:58,013
Ji Hyo, you're playing rock-paper-scissors.

1021
00:33:58,014 --> 00:34:00,144
<i>Rock-paper-scissors!</i>

1022
00:34:00,145 --> 00:34:02,089
(Bo Ra wins and will play offense.)

1023
00:34:03,084 --> 00:34:04,144
<i>Cham, cham, cham</i>

1024
00:34:04,145 --> 00:34:06,013
- What? - Hey, hold on.

1025
00:34:06,014 --> 00:34:07,823
- She won. - Bo Ra, it's your turn.

1026
00:34:07,824 --> 00:34:10,354
(Bo Ra should be playing offense.)

1027
00:34:10,355 --> 00:34:13,354
(But Ji Hyo played offense instead.)

1028
00:34:13,355 --> 00:34:14,363
(She's clueless when it comes to the rules.)

1029
00:34:14,364 --> 00:34:15,493
Did she win?

1030
00:34:15,494 --> 00:34:16,894
Did she? Hold on.

1031
00:34:16,895 --> 00:34:19,133
- Even I was confused. - Me too.

1032
00:34:19,134 --> 00:34:20,934
She was supposed to be on the offense.

1033
00:34:20,935 --> 00:34:22,704
Did I win? Really?

1034
00:34:22,705 --> 00:34:24,064
- My gosh. - Seriously?

1035
00:34:24,065 --> 00:34:25,403
Didn't you know?

1036
00:34:25,404 --> 00:34:26,903
Am I playing offense?

1037
00:34:26,904 --> 00:34:29,104
- I just sat there. - Play Cham, Cham, Cham.

1038
00:34:29,105 --> 00:34:30,104
Play Cham, Cham, Cham.

1039
00:34:30,105 --> 00:34:31,243
<i>Cham, cham, cham</i>

1040
00:34:31,244 --> 00:34:33,613
(Bo Ra wins and gets a chance to slap Ji Hyo.)

1041
00:34:33,614 --> 00:34:34,713
- What? <i>- Cham, cham, cham</i>

1042
00:34:34,714 --> 00:34:36,513
- Wait, you won. - You won!

1043
00:34:36,514 --> 00:34:38,513
(Bo Ra won so she gets to slap you!)

1044
00:34:38,514 --> 00:34:39,513
(Why are you playing Cham, Cham, Cham again?)

1045
00:34:39,514 --> 00:34:40,783
You won.

1046
00:34:40,784 --> 00:34:42,053
- Do I slap her? - Yes.

1047
00:34:42,054 --> 00:34:43,584
Why are you so bad at this?

1048
00:34:43,585 --> 00:34:45,700
- You won, so slap her. - I see.

1049
00:34:46,355 --> 00:34:47,870
(Thump)

1050
00:34:48,625 --> 00:34:51,794
(Can Ji Hyo smile after this?)

1051
00:34:51,795 --> 00:34:53,033
(Smiling)

1052
00:34:53,034 --> 00:34:54,439
- Hold on. - Are you all right?

1053
00:34:54,835 --> 00:34:56,303
(Ji Hyo...)

1054
00:34:56,304 --> 00:34:59,050
- Gosh, I'm sorry. - You slap her and then apologize?

1055
00:35:00,705 --> 00:35:02,943
- I'm sorry. - Okay. Go again.

1056
00:35:02,944 --> 00:35:03,974
<i>Rock-paper-scissors</i>

1057
00:35:03,975 --> 00:35:05,113
(Bo Ra wins.)

1058
00:35:05,114 --> 00:35:06,113
<i>Cham, cham, cham</i>

1059
00:35:06,114 --> 00:35:07,213
(Bo Ra wins another slap.)

1060
00:35:07,214 --> 00:35:09,743
- Nice. - Are they idiots?

1061
00:35:09,744 --> 00:35:11,684
- Unbelievable. - This is fun though.

1062
00:35:11,685 --> 00:35:13,289
Ji Hyo's still smiling.

1063
00:35:13,955 --> 00:35:15,224
<i>- Rock-paper-scissors - Rock-paper-scissors</i>

1064
00:35:15,225 --> 00:35:16,224
(Bo Ra wins for the third time with paper.)

1065
00:35:16,225 --> 00:35:18,129
- Hold on. <i>- Cham, cham, cham</i>

1066
00:35:19,255 --> 00:35:21,800
(She wins for the third time with the same direction.)

1067
00:35:22,194 --> 00:35:24,834
<i>- Cham, cham, cham</i> - Hold on a second.

1068
00:35:24,835 --> 00:35:26,693
Ji Hyo, is it impossible to look the other way?

1069
00:35:26,694 --> 00:35:31,050
Look this way too. Why are you only looking that way?

1070
00:35:31,904 --> 00:35:33,580
<i>- Rock-paper-scissors - Rock-paper-scissors</i>

1071
00:35:33,705 --> 00:35:35,220
- Now... <i>- Cham, cham, cham</i>

1072
00:35:35,744 --> 00:35:36,874
- Gosh. - Okay.

1073
00:35:36,875 --> 00:35:37,943
- Start right away. <i>- Cham, cham, cham</i>

1074
00:35:37,944 --> 00:35:39,343
(Bo Ra loses this time.)

1075
00:35:39,344 --> 00:35:40,613
Okay! Hit hard.

1076
00:35:40,614 --> 00:35:43,060
(Let me pay you back this time.)

1077
00:35:44,214 --> 00:35:45,684
- Hit as hard as you can. - Smack her!

1078
00:35:45,685 --> 00:35:46,783
- Smack her! - Smack her!

1079
00:35:46,784 --> 00:35:47,859
(Will Bo Ra be able to keep a smile on her face?)

1080
00:35:48,784 --> 00:35:50,184
(Smack)

1081
00:35:50,185 --> 00:35:52,124
(She fails to keep a smile.)

1082
00:35:52,125 --> 00:35:54,069
- Ji Hyo wins. - Ji Hyo wins by hitting hard.

1083
00:35:54,395 --> 00:35:56,439
(Knockout)

1084
00:35:56,625 --> 00:35:57,939
Ji Hyo wins by hitting hard.

1085
00:35:57,964 --> 00:35:59,133
- I failed to smile, right? - You failed to smile.

1086
00:35:59,134 --> 00:36:01,033
- You're out. - You didn't smile?

1087
00:36:01,034 --> 00:36:02,263
Ji Hyo.

1088
00:36:02,264 --> 00:36:04,850
I think you still lost.

1089
00:36:04,904 --> 00:36:07,033
- Why do I feel like I lost? - How many times did you get hit?

1090
00:36:07,034 --> 00:36:08,544
How many times did you get hit?

1091
00:36:08,545 --> 00:36:09,903
- I feel... - Good job.

1092
00:36:09,904 --> 00:36:12,314
- How many times did you get hit? - She got hit many times.

1093
00:36:12,315 --> 00:36:13,613
Spin the roulette wheel now.

1094
00:36:13,614 --> 00:36:14,789
I'll spin it.

1095
00:36:15,685 --> 00:36:16,814
(What penalty will be given to Kwang Soo?)

1096
00:36:16,815 --> 00:36:18,883
- A cartwheel would be the easiest. - Not the name tag, please.

1097
00:36:18,884 --> 00:36:20,530
(What penalty will be given to Kwang Soo?)

1098
00:36:21,424 --> 00:36:22,684
(Fan-meet group dance)

1099
00:36:22,685 --> 00:36:24,030
No!

1100
00:36:24,125 --> 00:36:25,769
- Fan-meet group dance. - That's...

1101
00:36:25,824 --> 00:36:27,769
How long does he have to dance?

1102
00:36:27,824 --> 00:36:28,939
For 30 seconds.

1103
00:36:29,065 --> 00:36:30,493
For 30 seconds?

1104
00:36:30,494 --> 00:36:31,533
The group dance?

1105
00:36:31,534 --> 00:36:32,763
Spin it.

1106
00:36:32,764 --> 00:36:33,763
The machine gun, please.

1107
00:36:33,764 --> 00:36:35,280
(Jae Seok will be given 2 penalties.)

1108
00:36:35,605 --> 00:36:37,403
- Laughing out loud for 10 seconds. - Wait.

1109
00:36:37,404 --> 00:36:38,780
Laughing out loud.

1110
00:36:38,804 --> 00:36:40,274
- Spin it one more time. - Spin it again.

1111
00:36:40,275 --> 00:36:42,019
Spin it hard. 1, 2, 3.

1112
00:36:42,344 --> 00:36:44,319
- Please. - We get two penalties.

1113
00:36:44,875 --> 00:36:46,749
- Okay. - Asking for directions.

1114
00:36:47,275 --> 00:36:48,914
- Asking for directions. - That's not good.

1115
00:36:48,915 --> 00:36:50,343
My goodness.

1116
00:36:50,344 --> 00:36:51,859
I'll let them know now.

1117
00:36:52,384 --> 00:36:55,499
(Jae Seok is satisfied with his disguise.)

1118
00:36:57,025 --> 00:36:59,269
(No one will recognize me, right?)

1119
00:36:59,494 --> 00:37:02,493
(He manages to go into the station without being noticed by others.)

1120
00:37:02,494 --> 00:37:04,794
- Jae Seok. - Yes?

1121
00:37:04,795 --> 00:37:06,834
You're given a penalty.

1122
00:37:06,835 --> 00:37:08,410
Gosh.

1123
00:37:08,534 --> 00:37:09,709
You get two penalties, actually.

1124
00:37:10,065 --> 00:37:11,609
Why do I get two?

1125
00:37:12,105 --> 00:37:15,350
One is to laugh out loud for 10 seconds.

1126
00:37:15,574 --> 00:37:18,474
And the other is to ask for directions.

1127
00:37:18,475 --> 00:37:21,189
You have to perform both of them.

1128
00:37:21,244 --> 00:37:22,760
My goodness.

1129
00:37:24,114 --> 00:37:25,289
The thing is...

1130
00:37:26,154 --> 00:37:27,729
I do look suspicious,

1131
00:37:28,625 --> 00:37:29,899
but no one seems to recognize me.

1132
00:37:30,225 --> 00:37:32,653
(This is going pretty well so far.)

1133
00:37:32,654 --> 00:37:34,354
- Do the group dance for 30 seconds. - What?

1134
00:37:34,355 --> 00:37:36,039
(The producer approaches him.)

1135
00:37:36,194 --> 00:37:38,140
(And he walks away.)

1136
00:37:38,235 --> 00:37:39,294
The group dance?

1137
00:37:39,295 --> 00:37:40,934
(In the middle of the street?)

1138
00:37:40,935 --> 00:37:42,439
Where?

1139
00:37:43,005 --> 00:37:44,204
(The other members can see them through a video call.)

1140
00:37:44,205 --> 00:37:45,350
There they are.

1141
00:37:45,674 --> 00:37:47,004
That's Kwang Soo, and that's Jae Seok?

1142
00:37:47,005 --> 00:37:48,379
That's Kwang Soo, and that's Jae Seok.

1143
00:37:48,574 --> 00:37:50,104
It's fun to watch someone secretly.

1144
00:37:50,105 --> 00:37:51,390
- Right. - It's always fun.

1145
00:37:51,815 --> 00:37:53,314
Gosh.

1146
00:37:53,315 --> 00:37:54,760
(Jae Seok is whining without knowing he's being watched.)

1147
00:37:54,915 --> 00:37:56,484
(Just then)

1148
00:37:56,485 --> 00:37:57,713
(Surprised)

1149
00:37:57,714 --> 00:37:59,530
Aren't you Yu Jae Seok?

1150
00:38:00,114 --> 00:38:02,454
(His name has already been said once.)

1151
00:38:02,455 --> 00:38:05,854
(The disguise expert faces his first crisis.)

1152
00:38:05,855 --> 00:38:08,839
(Laughing)

1153
00:38:08,994 --> 00:38:11,769
(Faced with a crisis, he starts laughing out loud.)

1154
00:38:11,895 --> 00:38:14,640
(He's attracting attention.)

1155
00:38:14,665 --> 00:38:16,680
He's laughing out loud.

1156
00:38:17,065 --> 00:38:20,550
(Yes, I'm Yu Jae Seok.)

1157
00:38:20,605 --> 00:38:23,419
(Captain Hwang has given up now.)

1158
00:38:24,944 --> 00:38:27,450
(Naturally, more and more people come to see him.)

1159
00:38:27,985 --> 00:38:31,089
(It wouldn't be strange even if the police showed up.)

1160
00:38:31,355 --> 00:38:32,513
Right?

1161
00:38:32,514 --> 00:38:35,030
(A textbook example of laughing out loud)

1162
00:38:35,924 --> 00:38:37,783
(Embarrassed)

1163
00:38:37,784 --> 00:38:39,254
(He's done laughing out loud for 10 seconds.)

1164
00:38:39,255 --> 00:38:41,193
(It's time to ask for directions.)

1165
00:38:41,194 --> 00:38:43,240
Well... Excuse me.

1166
00:38:43,694 --> 00:38:46,470
How do I get to Gongdeok Station?

1167
00:38:46,534 --> 00:38:48,209
- This is Gongdeok Station. - It is?

1168
00:38:48,634 --> 00:38:50,740
- You're Yu Jae Seok, right? - Yes.

1169
00:38:51,034 --> 00:38:52,903
(He ends up having a conversation.)

1170
00:38:52,904 --> 00:38:54,780
Can I get a picture with you?

1171
00:38:55,775 --> 00:38:57,504
- There. - They recognized him.

1172
00:38:57,505 --> 00:38:59,843
- Two people recognized him. - My goodness.

1173
00:38:59,844 --> 00:39:01,050
They're taking a picture with him.

1174
00:39:01,074 --> 00:39:03,419
They're taking a picture with Jae Seok. Nice!

1175
00:39:04,214 --> 00:39:06,089
Can I get a picture with you?

1176
00:39:06,585 --> 00:39:07,923
I'm not Yu Jae Seok right now.

1177
00:39:07,924 --> 00:39:09,629
- You're not? - No.

1178
00:39:09,654 --> 00:39:11,354
- I think you are. - I'm not.

1179
00:39:11,355 --> 00:39:12,493
I can't be.

1180
00:39:12,494 --> 00:39:14,894
- Please ignore me. - I want a picture with you.

1181
00:39:14,895 --> 00:39:16,939
Please ignore me. I beg you.

1182
00:39:17,264 --> 00:39:19,269
I'm sorry.

1183
00:39:19,295 --> 00:39:20,363
I'm carrying out a mission.

1184
00:39:20,364 --> 00:39:21,963
- He's Yu Jae Seok, right? - No.

1185
00:39:21,964 --> 00:39:23,539
- Are you Yu Jae Seok? - No.

1186
00:39:23,565 --> 00:39:26,033
Please imagine I'm not.

1187
00:39:26,034 --> 00:39:27,633
(Yu Jae Seok appears, but he is not Yu Jae Seok?)

1188
00:39:27,634 --> 00:39:28,803
No, I'm not.

1189
00:39:28,804 --> 00:39:30,580
(I'm sorry.)

1190
00:39:30,705 --> 00:39:32,443
(I have to walk boldly.)

1191
00:39:32,444 --> 00:39:34,144
What's with Kwang Soo's walk?

1192
00:39:34,145 --> 00:39:35,689
Why is he walking like that?

1193
00:39:37,145 --> 00:39:40,314
(His height and weird way of walking are attracting attention.)

1194
00:39:40,315 --> 00:39:43,560
(I even have to dance here?)

1195
00:39:43,661 --> 00:39:48,161
<font color="#fcc89b">[VIU Ver] SBS E474 Running Man</font>

1196
00:39:48,264 --> 00:39:50,300

1197
00:39:52,935 --> 00:39:55,463
(What is that?)

1198
00:39:55,464 --> 00:39:57,939
(Even the other members feel embarrassed.)

1199
00:39:57,975 --> 00:39:59,903
- Someone is taking pictures. - Who?

1200
00:39:59,904 --> 00:40:02,950
(- That's Lee Kwang Soo! - What is he doing?)

1201
00:40:03,705 --> 00:40:06,419
(He even dances better than at the fan-meet.)

1202
00:40:07,114 --> 00:40:08,760
(He tries to look cool.)

1203
00:40:09,545 --> 00:40:11,959
(He even sweeps the streets around Gongdeok Station.)

1204
00:40:15,324 --> 00:40:17,323
You're done.

1205
00:40:17,324 --> 00:40:19,129
(He's done dancing for 30 seconds.)

1206
00:40:19,295 --> 00:40:21,193
(He finally realizes people have been watching him.)

1207
00:40:21,194 --> 00:40:22,463
(Citizen 1)

1208
00:40:22,464 --> 00:40:24,870
(No one has said his name yet.)

1209
00:40:25,165 --> 00:40:26,939
(Suddenly)

1210
00:40:27,034 --> 00:40:28,339
Are you Lee Kwang Soo?

1211
00:40:30,005 --> 00:40:31,780
Pardon? How did you...

1212
00:40:32,605 --> 00:40:33,734
How did you know?

1213
00:40:33,735 --> 00:40:34,903
(He becomes a Pied Piper.)

1214
00:40:34,904 --> 00:40:38,120
(Lee Kwang Soo's fan-meet is held at Gongdeok Station.)

1215
00:40:38,514 --> 00:40:40,019
- Pardon? - You're Lee Kwang Soo, right?

1216
00:40:40,145 --> 00:40:41,243
You're Lee Kwang Soo.

1217
00:40:41,244 --> 00:40:42,314
Please stop saying that.

1218
00:40:42,315 --> 00:40:43,513
(Surprised)

1219
00:40:43,514 --> 00:40:45,060
I'm carrying out a mission.

1220
00:40:45,985 --> 00:40:47,189
Bye.

1221
00:40:47,614 --> 00:40:50,430
(If he doesn't finish his mission, his name will keep being said.)

1222
00:40:50,585 --> 00:40:53,569
(Jae Seok is going to look for a mission on the platform.)

1223
00:40:53,855 --> 00:40:55,740
I see something.

1224
00:40:56,964 --> 00:40:59,640
(A lot of artwork is displayed on the platform.)

1225
00:41:00,464 --> 00:41:03,379
(He scans the picture with the phone that the staff gave him.)

1226
00:41:04,565 --> 00:41:07,310
(What are these works of art?)

1227
00:41:10,545 --> 00:41:11,789
Oh, it's moving.

1228
00:41:11,815 --> 00:41:14,519
This person is dancing.

1229
00:41:15,714 --> 00:41:16,959
This must not be the mission.

1230
00:41:17,915 --> 00:41:18,984
(Is today's mission hidden among the artwork?)

1231
00:41:18,985 --> 00:41:20,160
My goodness.

1232
00:41:21,725 --> 00:41:24,224
(Kwang Soo is looking at the artwork too.)

1233
00:41:24,225 --> 00:41:25,399
Lee Kwang Soo!

1234
00:41:26,154 --> 00:41:27,993
(Attention, everyone!)

1235
00:41:27,994 --> 00:41:29,269
You're Lee Kwang Soo from Running Man.

1236
00:41:30,065 --> 00:41:31,263
You're Lee Kwang Soo, right?

1237
00:41:31,264 --> 00:41:32,339
(Panicking)

1238
00:41:32,694 --> 00:41:34,410
(Restless)

1239
00:41:35,505 --> 00:41:37,010
(What?)

1240
00:41:37,205 --> 00:41:38,510
Isn't that Yu Jae Seok?

1241
00:41:39,534 --> 00:41:41,419
(Jae Seok runs away.)

1242
00:41:43,645 --> 00:41:44,890
Wait.

1243
00:41:45,614 --> 00:41:47,314
(Jae Seok notices something and stops.)

1244
00:41:47,315 --> 00:41:48,383
There's this one too.

1245
00:41:48,384 --> 00:41:50,713
(There are pictures on the other wall too.)

1246
00:41:50,714 --> 00:41:53,330
(The man looks somewhat awkward.)

1247
00:41:53,455 --> 00:41:56,260
(He scans the picture with his phone.)

1248
00:41:56,284 --> 00:41:58,954
(He swipes the screen.)

1249
00:41:58,955 --> 00:42:00,193
(The lethargic-looking assistant director appears.)

1250
00:42:00,194 --> 00:42:03,499
(The banner reads, "Find me.")

1251
00:42:03,824 --> 00:42:06,510
(The hidden mission for Round 2 is to find the assistant director.)

1252
00:42:07,464 --> 00:42:09,879
(Hurrying)

1253
00:42:11,404 --> 00:42:12,609
Is he done?

1254
00:42:12,804 --> 00:42:14,379
(Where is he going?)

1255
00:42:15,275 --> 00:42:16,479
I saw him.

1256
00:42:16,605 --> 00:42:19,673
(Jae Seok passed by this booth earlier.)

1257
00:42:19,674 --> 00:42:23,589
(Why is he back here?)

1258
00:42:24,485 --> 00:42:25,660
I found him.

1259
00:42:26,054 --> 00:42:29,729
(Jae Seok finds the assistant director.)

1260
00:42:29,855 --> 00:42:32,330
(I found you.)

1261
00:42:32,895 --> 00:42:34,229
You've completed your mission.

1262
00:42:35,065 --> 00:42:36,794
(Jae Seok has completed his mission.)

1263
00:42:36,795 --> 00:42:38,169
My goodness.

1264
00:42:38,795 --> 00:42:41,240
- I'm burning up. - Kwang Soo.

1265
00:42:41,864 --> 00:42:43,234
Let me announce the final result.

1266
00:42:43,235 --> 00:42:45,173
The number of times their names were said.

1267
00:42:45,174 --> 00:42:47,080
- I can't wait. - Kwang Soo's name was said...

1268
00:42:47,404 --> 00:42:49,504
- eight times. - That's not a lot.

1269
00:42:49,505 --> 00:42:51,173
- It's only eight times. - That's not a lot.

1270
00:42:51,174 --> 00:42:52,450
- Is it not a lot? - The thing is,

1271
00:42:52,475 --> 00:42:54,474
people were suspicious, but they didn't say my name.

1272
00:42:54,475 --> 00:42:55,713
(He looked way too suspicious.)

1273
00:42:55,714 --> 00:42:57,213
Jae Seok's name was said...

1274
00:42:57,214 --> 00:42:58,814
(How many times was Jae Seok's name said?)

1275
00:42:58,815 --> 00:43:00,013
Twenty times.

1276
00:43:00,014 --> 00:43:02,100
(It's a complete defeat.)

1277
00:43:02,185 --> 00:43:03,984
(Because of his clumsy disguise, many people said his name.)

1278
00:43:03,985 --> 00:43:05,894
You were so sure no one would recognize you.

1279
00:43:05,895 --> 00:43:07,624
Not many people recognized me.

1280
00:43:07,625 --> 00:43:08,993
Did you count the ones who whispered too?

1281
00:43:08,994 --> 00:43:11,640
Some people said his name after he passed by.

1282
00:43:11,795 --> 00:43:15,240
The next representatives will be sent out now.

1283
00:43:15,665 --> 00:43:18,080
- How about we send female members? - Ji Hyo.

1284
00:43:18,335 --> 00:43:20,504
- Ji Hyo and So Min. - That sounds good.

1285
00:43:20,505 --> 00:43:21,850
So Min should go.

1286
00:43:21,875 --> 00:43:24,220
- Ji Hyo should go too. - No one will recognize me.

1287
00:43:24,475 --> 00:43:25,713
No one recognizes me when I'm alone.

1288
00:43:25,714 --> 00:43:27,814
I need Se Chan and Kwang Soo to be recognized by people.

1289
00:43:27,815 --> 00:43:30,044
- When I'm alone... - I think So Min...

1290
00:43:30,045 --> 00:43:31,459
(Who will win the second match?)

1291
00:43:31,985 --> 00:43:33,584
How about they don't cover their faces?

1292
00:43:33,585 --> 00:43:35,100
- That sounds good. - That'd be fair.

1293
00:43:36,424 --> 00:43:38,624
(They look like they're going to a convenience store.)

1294
00:43:38,625 --> 00:43:40,569
We eat it a lot.

1295
00:43:40,654 --> 00:43:42,470
That's Song Ji Hyo. They must be shooting Running Man.

1296
00:43:42,725 --> 00:43:43,970
My goodness.

1297
00:43:45,034 --> 00:43:46,763
(That's Song Ji Hyo.)

1298
00:43:46,764 --> 00:43:48,064
(They're recognized only 5 seconds in.)

1299
00:43:48,065 --> 00:43:50,180
- What did she say? - "They're shooting Running Man."

1300
00:43:50,705 --> 00:43:52,249
I'm having regrets.

1301
00:43:52,304 --> 00:43:54,749
- Is my jacket too bright? - You stand out too much.

1302
00:43:54,804 --> 00:43:56,620
My eyes are hurting.

1303
00:43:57,005 --> 00:43:59,089
Let's start the game.

1304
00:43:59,214 --> 00:44:00,314
<i>- Rock-paper-scissors - Rock-paper-scissors</i>

1305
00:44:00,315 --> 00:44:02,013
(Jae Seok wins the chance to initiate Cham, cham, cham.)

1306
00:44:02,014 --> 00:44:03,859
- Cham, cham, cham. - Jae Seok, you can start.

1307
00:44:04,344 --> 00:44:05,914
<i>- Cham, cham, cham</i> - Okay!

1308
00:44:05,915 --> 00:44:07,189
- Continue. - You can attack now.

1309
00:44:07,355 --> 00:44:08,684
<i>Cham, cham, cham. Okay!</i>

1310
00:44:08,685 --> 00:44:10,530
(Jae Seok loses.)

1311
00:44:10,855 --> 00:44:12,430
- Smack him! - Do it!

1312
00:44:14,094 --> 00:44:16,124
(Laughing)

1313
00:44:16,125 --> 00:44:17,894
(He puts on a big smile.)

1314
00:44:17,895 --> 00:44:20,769
There you go. He passes.

1315
00:44:20,795 --> 00:44:22,939
- It's not easy. - He passes.

1316
00:44:23,034 --> 00:44:25,004
- This feels so nice. - He passes.

1317
00:44:25,005 --> 00:44:26,180
Okay.

1318
00:44:26,275 --> 00:44:27,450
<i>Cham, cham, cham</i>

1319
00:44:27,935 --> 00:44:29,149
Good job.

1320
00:44:29,475 --> 00:44:31,919
(He changed the direction right away.)

1321
00:44:33,545 --> 00:44:34,673
Good job.

1322
00:44:34,674 --> 00:44:35,843
Did you say, "Good job"?

1323
00:44:35,844 --> 00:44:37,089
- Jae Seok. - You did a very good job.

1324
00:44:37,444 --> 00:44:38,584
Is this allowed?

1325
00:44:38,585 --> 00:44:40,629
- Is this allowed? - He changed the direction too late.

1326
00:44:40,685 --> 00:44:43,300
- It's allowed. Jae Seok fooled you. - Right.

1327
00:44:43,384 --> 00:44:44,954
<i>Cham, cham, cham</i>

1328
00:44:44,955 --> 00:44:46,729
(It's my turn.)

1329
00:44:47,054 --> 00:44:49,193
(Kwang Soo succeeded at first.)

1330
00:44:49,194 --> 00:44:51,863
(Cham, cham, cham, cham?)

1331
00:44:51,864 --> 00:44:53,693
That's cheating.

1332
00:44:53,694 --> 00:44:54,794
What?

1333
00:44:54,795 --> 00:44:55,963
Hold on.

1334
00:44:55,964 --> 00:44:57,263
- He smiled, so it's okay. - I definitely...

1335
00:44:57,264 --> 00:44:59,149
(Is this allowed?)

1336
00:45:00,074 --> 00:45:01,403
It's my habit.

1337
00:45:01,404 --> 00:45:03,280
- Is it really okay? - It's just my habit.

1338
00:45:03,375 --> 00:45:04,850
Why do you have to say "cham" only three times?

1339
00:45:05,344 --> 00:45:07,874
- You can say it 5 or 14 times too. - Okay!

1340
00:45:07,875 --> 00:45:09,390
- I won't do it again. - Okay!

1341
00:45:10,185 --> 00:45:12,053
<i>Cham, cham, cham, cham, cham...</i>

1342
00:45:12,054 --> 00:45:14,189
Why aren't you moving?

1343
00:45:14,284 --> 00:45:16,224
(Jae Seok isn't moving.)

1344
00:45:16,225 --> 00:45:18,530
(Aren't you going to play the game?)

1345
00:45:18,924 --> 00:45:20,399
It's just my know-how.

1346
00:45:21,424 --> 00:45:22,970
(Kwang Soo tries his know-how again.)

1347
00:45:23,464 --> 00:45:25,069
(Jae Seok succeeds.)

1348
00:45:25,165 --> 00:45:26,193
(Jae Seok sees through Kwang Soo's know-how.)

1349
00:45:26,194 --> 00:45:27,370
That was close.

1350
00:45:27,735 --> 00:45:28,963
Hey!

1351
00:45:28,964 --> 00:45:30,863
Why didn't you continue?

1352
00:45:30,864 --> 00:45:33,173
- You should have continued. - Hey!

1353
00:45:33,174 --> 00:45:35,073
- Exactly. - Why did you end it?

1354
00:45:35,074 --> 00:45:38,689
<i>Cham, cham, cham...</i>

1355
00:45:40,145 --> 00:45:42,720
(He ends up following the hand.)

1356
00:45:43,415 --> 00:45:45,390
(He fails to smile.)

1357
00:45:45,455 --> 00:45:47,383
(He quickly puts on a smile.)

1358
00:45:47,384 --> 00:45:48,959
Kwang Soo failed.

1359
00:45:49,225 --> 00:45:51,624
Kwang Soo isn't a fool!

1360
00:45:51,625 --> 00:45:53,454
- All right. - Kwang Soo isn't a fool!

1361
00:45:53,455 --> 00:45:54,724
- Kwang Soo. - I did it.

1362
00:45:54,725 --> 00:45:56,794
- Cham, cham, cham. - I am good at this game.

1363
00:45:56,795 --> 00:45:58,734
You really are good at this game.

1364
00:45:58,735 --> 00:46:00,164
(The results of the roulette are sent!)

1365
00:46:00,165 --> 00:46:02,010
How is it that no one recognizes me?

1366
00:46:02,304 --> 00:46:04,504
So Min, please stop for a second.

1367
00:46:04,505 --> 00:46:05,774
Is it time to do the mission?

1368
00:46:05,775 --> 00:46:09,120
Pretend to get shot by a machine gun realistically.

1369
00:46:09,975 --> 00:46:11,044
- Here? - Yes.

1370
00:46:11,045 --> 00:46:12,450
- Here? - Yes.

1371
00:46:12,944 --> 00:46:14,573
(She gets into the emotion.)

1372
00:46:14,574 --> 00:46:15,760
How should I do it?

1373
00:46:16,514 --> 00:46:18,430
(Shooting)

1374
00:46:19,654 --> 00:46:21,830
(Did Ji Hyo get hit?)

1375
00:46:22,284 --> 00:46:24,553
(Having gotten the cartwheel as a penalty,)

1376
00:46:24,554 --> 00:46:26,899
(Ji Hyo jumped in as soon as she saw So Min.)

1377
00:46:27,125 --> 00:46:28,999
(It's a cartwheel.)

1378
00:46:29,025 --> 00:46:31,339
(It looks like she has been shot.)

1379
00:46:31,634 --> 00:46:33,463
(It's an intense battle between the two actresses.)

1380
00:46:33,464 --> 00:46:35,640
- I am dying. - I am in tears.

1381
00:46:35,835 --> 00:46:37,740
I am dying.

1382
00:46:38,574 --> 00:46:40,810
(They watch a scene from a war movie together.)

1383
00:46:42,105 --> 00:46:43,474
Was that a cartwheel?

1384
00:46:43,475 --> 00:46:44,743
That was a cartwheel.

1385
00:46:44,744 --> 00:46:46,649
I am dying.

1386
00:46:47,614 --> 00:46:49,144
It's Jeon So Min!

1387
00:46:49,145 --> 00:46:51,013
I am dying.

1388
00:46:51,014 --> 00:46:53,160
(After revealing So Min's identity, Ji Hyo escapes...)

1389
00:46:53,485 --> 00:46:55,984
(and begins to do the group dance.)

1390
00:46:55,985 --> 00:46:58,894
(Ji Hyo's dance doesn't look perfect anymore.)

1391
00:46:58,895 --> 00:47:00,269
That hurts.

1392
00:47:00,895 --> 00:47:02,800
They're filming Running Man!

1393
00:47:03,065 --> 00:47:05,539
That's Song Ji Hyo! No way!

1394
00:47:05,565 --> 00:47:07,609
(She freezes on the spot.)

1395
00:47:07,764 --> 00:47:09,510
- This is incredible. - They're filming Running Man.

1396
00:47:09,665 --> 00:47:12,109
(She runs away.)

1397
00:47:13,404 --> 00:47:15,550
(She catches her breath.)

1398
00:47:16,545 --> 00:47:18,550
It's Song Ji Hyo! How cool!

1399
00:47:20,045 --> 00:47:22,060
(Ji Hyo, you are the best.)

1400
00:47:22,985 --> 00:47:24,519
Ji Hyo, I am a fan!

1401
00:47:25,114 --> 00:47:26,954
(A younger male fan appears.)

1402
00:47:26,955 --> 00:47:28,260
Thank you.

1403
00:47:28,955 --> 00:47:31,499
(She shows her popularity at Gongdeok Station.)

1404
00:47:31,755 --> 00:47:33,569
(Meanwhile, So Min)

1405
00:47:34,225 --> 00:47:36,939
(She is looking for her mission in an orange top.)

1406
00:47:38,324 --> 00:47:40,769
It doesn't work. It doesn't work.

1407
00:47:42,364 --> 00:47:46,479
(She moves through the crowd to complete her mission.)

1408
00:47:50,275 --> 00:47:52,474
I can't believe this. How is it that no one...

1409
00:47:52,475 --> 00:47:55,044
I'm taking off my cap. No one is calling my name.

1410
00:47:55,045 --> 00:47:57,414
(It's about time someone calls my name.)

1411
00:47:57,415 --> 00:48:00,330
No one called my name on my way here.

1412
00:48:02,125 --> 00:48:04,660
I keeping my cap off.

1413
00:48:04,985 --> 00:48:08,399
Hold on. You need to carry out two penalties.

1414
00:48:08,725 --> 00:48:10,224
Do three cartwheels...

1415
00:48:10,225 --> 00:48:13,010
and laugh out loud for 10 seconds.

1416
00:48:13,565 --> 00:48:14,810
Please do them now.

1417
00:48:15,605 --> 00:48:17,180
I will laugh out loud first.

1418
00:48:17,435 --> 00:48:21,649
(Laughing)

1419
00:48:22,174 --> 00:48:24,379
(She keeps her movements big to catch people's attention.)

1420
00:48:25,344 --> 00:48:27,113
So Min wants people to recognize her.

1421
00:48:27,114 --> 00:48:29,484
That's why she took off her cap.

1422
00:48:29,485 --> 00:48:31,319
- They aren't sparing her a glance. - Did she take off her cap?

1423
00:48:31,384 --> 00:48:33,330
What is going on?

1424
00:48:33,855 --> 00:48:35,899
The passers-by must be scared.

1425
00:48:35,955 --> 00:48:38,060
Gosh, my stomach hurts. How funny!

1426
00:48:38,855 --> 00:48:40,254
Jeon So Min!

1427
00:48:40,255 --> 00:48:42,493
Jeon So Min! Jeon So Min!

1428
00:48:42,494 --> 00:48:45,263
How funny! Jeon So Min!

1429
00:48:45,264 --> 00:48:46,410
(How did that young woman go crazy?)

1430
00:48:47,235 --> 00:48:48,910
(Embarrassed)

1431
00:48:49,364 --> 00:48:51,339
(Is this a hidden camera prank?)

1432
00:48:52,098 --> 00:48:54,133
- I will do a cartwheel. - Do three cartwheels.

1433
00:48:54,134 --> 00:48:57,839
(Will people recognize So Min this time?)

1434
00:48:58,145 --> 00:49:00,249
- I will do a cartwheel. - Do three cartwheels.

1435
00:49:01,045 --> 00:49:03,180


1436
00:49:04,395 --> 00:49:07,340
(It's Jeon So Min.)

1437
00:49:07,794 --> 00:49:10,470
(There are a lot of strange people at the station today.)

1438
00:49:11,535 --> 00:49:12,834
(There is only silence.)

1439
00:49:12,835 --> 00:49:14,539
No one knows who I am.

1440
00:49:15,105 --> 00:49:16,604
No one knows who I am.

1441
00:49:16,605 --> 00:49:18,204
- People don't recognize her. - How is this possible?

1442
00:49:18,205 --> 00:49:20,043
How is this possible?

1443
00:49:20,044 --> 00:49:21,974
Let her wear her name tag on her forehead.

1444
00:49:21,975 --> 00:49:23,974
People just think she is a lunatic.

1445
00:49:23,975 --> 00:49:25,244
She is invincible.

1446
00:49:25,245 --> 00:49:26,959
She is invincible.

1447
00:49:27,214 --> 00:49:29,559
(She can protect her private life perfectly.)

1448
00:49:29,884 --> 00:49:31,160
I haven't...

1449
00:49:31,185 --> 00:49:34,059
I haven't heard my name once on my way here.

1450
00:49:34,654 --> 00:49:36,200
Can I take this off?

1451
00:49:37,355 --> 00:49:39,724
(Meanwhile, the daughter of Mapo-gu is loading up her machine gun.)

1452
00:49:39,725 --> 00:49:41,400
(Pretend to get shot with a machine gun.)

1453
00:49:42,294 --> 00:49:45,039
(Shooting)

1454
00:49:45,665 --> 00:49:47,209
(This man is startled.)

1455
00:49:49,004 --> 00:49:51,110
(Shouting)

1456
00:49:52,944 --> 00:49:55,050
(My goodness.)

1457
00:49:56,975 --> 00:49:58,220
I am so embarrassed.

1458
00:49:58,745 --> 00:49:59,813
(While they are wandering around the station)

1459
00:49:59,814 --> 00:50:02,490
This round should be...

1460
00:50:02,515 --> 00:50:04,684
- between Seok Jin and Se Chan. - Se Chan.

1461
00:50:04,685 --> 00:50:05,923
Go ahead, Se Chan.

1462
00:50:05,924 --> 00:50:08,300
Se Chan is really strong.

1463
00:50:08,325 --> 00:50:09,324
(I need to intimidate him.)

1464
00:50:09,325 --> 00:50:10,900
Se Chan and Seok Jin.

1465
00:50:11,455 --> 00:50:12,599
(Ouch.)

1466
00:50:13,395 --> 00:50:14,463
(This is how Seok Jin intimidates.)

1467
00:50:14,464 --> 00:50:15,733
Why did you hit me?

1468
00:50:15,734 --> 00:50:17,334
Why are they hitting each other?

1469
00:50:17,335 --> 00:50:18,664
- What is going on? - Hey.

1470
00:50:18,665 --> 00:50:20,764
- What is up with this atmosphere? - What is going on?

1471
00:50:20,765 --> 00:50:22,434
What is wrong with you?

1472
00:50:22,435 --> 00:50:24,403
That's not how you play this game.

1473
00:50:24,404 --> 00:50:25,704
Sit down.

1474
00:50:25,705 --> 00:50:26,704
- Seok Jin. - Sit down.

1475
00:50:26,705 --> 00:50:28,990
Do you have anger management issues?

1476
00:50:29,114 --> 00:50:30,613
- Seriously. - Why did you beat him up?

1477
00:50:30,614 --> 00:50:32,113
- Why did you do that? - What's wrong?

1478
00:50:32,114 --> 00:50:34,213
- Why did you do that? - I don't know.

1479
00:50:34,214 --> 00:50:35,414
All right.

1480
00:50:35,415 --> 00:50:36,613
<i>Rock-paper-scissors</i>

1481
00:50:36,614 --> 00:50:38,459
(Se Chan gets a chance to do cham, cham, cham.)

1482
00:50:38,685 --> 00:50:40,260
(Nervous)

1483
00:50:40,654 --> 00:50:41,793
<i>Cham, cham, cham</i>

1484
00:50:41,794 --> 00:50:42,869
(He gets caught.)

1485
00:50:43,654 --> 00:50:45,669
(Smacking)

1486
00:50:46,495 --> 00:50:47,939
(Even Se Chan becomes surprised.)

1487
00:50:49,835 --> 00:50:52,110
(Seok Jin manages to smile.)

1488
00:50:52,265 --> 00:50:54,380
(Seok Jin, are you okay?)

1489
00:50:54,835 --> 00:50:57,709
He put so much power into it!

1490
00:50:58,305 --> 00:51:00,244
I feel dizzy.

1491
00:51:00,245 --> 00:51:01,443
I got goosebumps.

1492
00:51:01,444 --> 00:51:03,673
Good job.

1493
00:51:03,674 --> 00:51:05,084
- Good job. Okay. - Yes.

1494
00:51:05,085 --> 00:51:06,514
Okay.

1495
00:51:06,515 --> 00:51:08,119
Yes!

1496
00:51:09,055 --> 00:51:11,189
(The atmosphere becomes heated up.)

1497
00:51:11,785 --> 00:51:13,329
That was a good blow.

1498
00:51:13,785 --> 00:51:15,153
All right.

1499
00:51:15,154 --> 00:51:16,224
<i>Cham, cham, cham</i>

1500
00:51:16,225 --> 00:51:17,253
(Seok Jin fails.)

1501
00:51:17,254 --> 00:51:18,324
I got chills.

1502
00:51:18,325 --> 00:51:19,363
<i>Cham, cham, cham</i>

1503
00:51:19,364 --> 00:51:20,869
(Seok Jin gets caught again.)

1504
00:51:21,594 --> 00:51:23,563
(Se Chan gets ready.)

1505
00:51:23,564 --> 00:51:25,639
(Smacking)

1506
00:51:27,335 --> 00:51:29,680
(Laughing)

1507
00:51:29,805 --> 00:51:30,974
(He is scary.)

1508
00:51:30,975 --> 00:51:32,249
- He is scary. - Don't cry.

1509
00:51:32,944 --> 00:51:37,220
(Will you introduce me as the Big Nosed Joker?)

1510
00:51:38,245 --> 00:51:40,383
(I thought my life was a comedy.)

1511
00:51:40,384 --> 00:51:41,490
My goodness.

1512
00:51:41,654 --> 00:51:43,030
My goodness.

1513
00:51:43,214 --> 00:51:45,829
- He isn't laughing. - I give up.

1514
00:51:45,984 --> 00:51:47,700
(You can't give up.)

1515
00:51:48,455 --> 00:51:50,030
Did you laugh?

1516
00:51:50,225 --> 00:51:52,863
I laughed at first, didn't I? I did it once. Sit down.

1517
00:51:52,864 --> 00:51:53,923
- Seok Jin. - Sit down.

1518
00:51:53,924 --> 00:51:55,133
- You didn't cry, did you? - No.

1519
00:51:55,134 --> 00:51:56,394
- My goodness. - It's okay.

1520
00:51:56,395 --> 00:51:57,639
<i>Rock-paper-scissors</i>

1521
00:51:57,734 --> 00:51:59,010
<i>Cham, cham, cham</i>

1522
00:51:59,035 --> 00:52:00,340
<i>Cham, cham, cham</i>

1523
00:52:00,964 --> 00:52:02,034
(Laughing)

1524
00:52:02,035 --> 00:52:03,880
Just end the game.

1525
00:52:04,205 --> 00:52:06,849
(Laughing)

1526
00:52:07,145 --> 00:52:08,144
Just end the game.

1527
00:52:08,145 --> 00:52:09,744
(We lost.)

1528
00:52:09,745 --> 00:52:11,744
No, no. You can't do that.

1529
00:52:11,745 --> 00:52:13,644
- You can't do that. - Come and sit down.

1530
00:52:13,645 --> 00:52:16,113
No, no. You can't do that.

1531
00:52:16,114 --> 00:52:18,014
- You can't do that. - Come and sit down.

1532
00:52:18,015 --> 00:52:19,483
No, no.

1533
00:52:19,484 --> 00:52:21,224
No, Seok Jin.

1534
00:52:21,225 --> 00:52:22,624
- Sit down. - He will die.

1535
00:52:22,625 --> 00:52:23,999
Sit down!

1536
00:52:24,625 --> 00:52:25,693
Sit down.

1537
00:52:25,694 --> 00:52:26,894
Let me hit you just once.

1538
00:52:26,895 --> 00:52:28,693
- Se Chan, you went too far. - What?

1539
00:52:28,694 --> 00:52:30,764
- This is a game. - You jerk.

1540
00:52:30,765 --> 00:52:32,110
- Let me hit you just once. - Stop it.

1541
00:52:32,335 --> 00:52:34,164
Stop it.

1542
00:52:34,165 --> 00:52:35,733
- Stop it. - My goodness.

1543
00:52:35,734 --> 00:52:37,133
I am so good at this game.

1544
00:52:37,134 --> 00:52:38,380
You are so good at this game.

1545
00:52:38,404 --> 00:52:40,273
You don't need to spin the roulette since they completed the mission.

1546
00:52:40,274 --> 00:52:41,574
They will be here shortly.

1547
00:52:41,575 --> 00:52:43,213
(You don't need to spin the roulette since they completed the mission.)

1548
00:52:43,214 --> 00:52:44,574
- Why did we do this? - Why did we play this game?

1549
00:52:44,575 --> 00:52:45,720
(Flustered)

1550
00:52:46,544 --> 00:52:48,854
Why did we play this game? Why?

1551
00:52:48,855 --> 00:52:50,613
They just completed it.

1552
00:52:50,614 --> 00:52:51,930
My stomach hurts from laughing.

1553
00:52:52,455 --> 00:52:53,883
Kwang Soo, did you do the mission?

1554
00:52:53,884 --> 00:52:55,400
Yes, I did.

1555
00:52:56,895 --> 00:52:58,840
(Yes, I did.)

1556
00:53:00,225 --> 00:53:01,733
- What mission? - What?

1557
00:53:01,734 --> 00:53:03,510
- What are you talking about? - What did you say?

1558
00:53:03,665 --> 00:53:05,680
For goodness' sake.

1559
00:53:05,864 --> 00:53:07,264
(Did he confess that he did a mission as a thief?)

1560
00:53:07,265 --> 00:53:08,910
- Hold on. - It's not like that.

1561
00:53:09,004 --> 00:53:10,204
- They don't even hide it! - Hold on.

1562
00:53:10,205 --> 00:53:11,434
They don't even hide it!

1563
00:53:11,435 --> 00:53:13,880
I was talking about the mission at the station.

1564
00:53:13,904 --> 00:53:15,773
Kwang Soo is a thief!

1565
00:53:15,774 --> 00:53:17,249
The mission at the station.

1566
00:53:17,344 --> 00:53:19,744
- The mission at the station. - Forget it.

1567
00:53:19,745 --> 00:53:21,584
- It's game over. - You startled me.

1568
00:53:21,585 --> 00:53:22,813
It's a misunderstanding.

1569
00:53:22,814 --> 00:53:24,590
This is all because of you!

1570
00:53:24,614 --> 00:53:25,883
I am not a thief.

1571
00:53:25,884 --> 00:53:27,483
- The mission at the station. - Stop it.

1572
00:53:27,484 --> 00:53:28,753
That mission.

1573
00:53:28,754 --> 00:53:31,293
The two of you are suspicious as you are.

1574
00:53:31,294 --> 00:53:33,139
- I can't believe them. - The mission at the station.

1575
00:53:33,364 --> 00:53:34,593
- Ji Hyo. - She is back.

1576
00:53:34,594 --> 00:53:35,733
(The daughter of Mapo-gu comes back.)

1577
00:53:35,734 --> 00:53:36,994
You must have completed the mission first.

1578
00:53:36,995 --> 00:53:38,503
You became haggard.

1579
00:53:38,504 --> 00:53:40,903
- Ji Hyo. - I even received a flyer.

1580
00:53:40,904 --> 00:53:42,209
- Really? - Yes.

1581
00:53:42,375 --> 00:53:43,880
(She didn't suspect Ji Hyo's identity.)

1582
00:53:44,435 --> 00:53:45,804
(She must have really looked like a non-celebrity.)

1583
00:53:45,805 --> 00:53:47,074
The part-timer...

1584
00:53:47,075 --> 00:53:49,514
- You even received a flyer. - didn't recognize me.

1585
00:53:49,515 --> 00:53:51,474
- A practical nursing academy. - That's the flyer.

1586
00:53:51,475 --> 00:53:53,090
I even received a flyer.

1587
00:53:53,314 --> 00:53:54,943
She thought you should become a practical nurse.

1588
00:53:54,944 --> 00:53:56,253
- So Min. - Yes?

1589
00:53:56,254 --> 00:53:59,153
- Jeon So Min. - It's okay.

1590
00:53:59,154 --> 00:54:00,430
So Min.

1591
00:54:00,685 --> 00:54:03,753
- Jeon So Min! Jeon So Min! - It's okay.

1592
00:54:03,754 --> 00:54:05,923
- It's all right. - Jeon So Min!

1593
00:54:05,924 --> 00:54:07,023
- So Min. - Jeon So Min!

1594
00:54:07,024 --> 00:54:08,639
Work hard.

1595
00:54:08,895 --> 00:54:12,204
I worked hard. I had my name tag on, but no one called me.

1596
00:54:12,205 --> 00:54:13,403
Not even once.

1597
00:54:13,404 --> 00:54:15,673
I'll announce how many times your name was called in Round Two.

1598
00:54:15,674 --> 00:54:16,903
Are you going to tell us?

1599
00:54:16,904 --> 00:54:18,380
Ji Hyo.

1600
00:54:18,745 --> 00:54:19,849
Six times.

1601
00:54:20,575 --> 00:54:22,773
- Was I called 6 times? - You were called 6 times.

1602
00:54:22,774 --> 00:54:25,519
So Min was called twice.

1603
00:54:25,944 --> 00:54:28,959
Once she asked what her name was, so it won't be counted.

1604
00:54:29,355 --> 00:54:31,113
(Do you know my name?)

1605
00:54:31,114 --> 00:54:32,554
Jeon So Min.

1606
00:54:32,555 --> 00:54:35,653
I wanted someone to call me, so I asked.

1607
00:54:35,654 --> 00:54:39,099
So Min, you shouldn't be singing at festivals.

1608
00:54:39,294 --> 00:54:43,394
Members of Team Bo Ra were called a total of 21 times.

1609
00:54:43,395 --> 00:54:45,963
Members of Team Min Si were called 14 times.

1610
00:54:45,964 --> 00:54:48,003
- Who won? - Team Min Si is the winner.

1611
00:54:48,004 --> 00:54:49,410
(Team Min Si wins.)

1612
00:54:49,674 --> 00:54:51,843
- Okay. - Okay.

1613
00:54:51,844 --> 00:54:54,403
I didn't gain anything. I was barely called, and we lost.

1614
00:54:54,404 --> 00:54:56,014
- I know. - Starting from now,

1615
00:54:56,015 --> 00:54:58,043
thieves will stop temporarily their hidden mission.

1616
00:54:58,044 --> 00:54:59,113
It's a temporary stop.

1617
00:54:59,114 --> 00:55:01,954
I'll announce the thieves' current number of gold bars

1618
00:55:01,955 --> 00:55:03,153
What?

1619
00:55:03,154 --> 00:55:05,883
If the number is the same, the thieves are on the same team.

1620
00:55:05,884 --> 00:55:08,329
- Okay. - How many gold bars thieves have.

1621
00:55:08,594 --> 00:55:10,793
(After the first mission, the thieves had 4 gold bars.)

1622
00:55:10,794 --> 00:55:13,593
(How many gold bars do they have after the second mission?)

1623
00:55:13,594 --> 00:55:15,563
- They have four. - The number is the same.

1624
00:55:15,564 --> 00:55:16,669
(They still have 4 gold bars.)

1625
00:55:16,964 --> 00:55:18,394
(The number didn't change which means...)

1626
00:55:18,395 --> 00:55:20,340
- They're on the same team. - They are.

1627
00:55:20,504 --> 00:55:23,233
I told you. All of them are on this team.

1628
00:55:23,234 --> 00:55:24,233
They're on the same team.

1629
00:55:24,234 --> 00:55:25,773
- Seok Jin... - Are these the two?

1630
00:55:25,774 --> 00:55:27,003
- and Jae Seok. - They aren't on this team.

1631
00:55:27,004 --> 00:55:28,374
It's these two.

1632
00:55:28,375 --> 00:55:31,543
When I was tearing it off, he denied it.

1633
00:55:31,544 --> 00:55:32,919
Captain Hwang.

1634
00:55:32,944 --> 00:55:34,043
Why are you approaching me?

1635
00:55:34,044 --> 00:55:35,684
- Come on. - He said, "It's not me."

1636
00:55:35,685 --> 00:55:37,084
- Captain Hwang, it's not me. - Calm down.

1637
00:55:37,085 --> 00:55:38,854
- Calm down. - Did I get excited again?

1638
00:55:38,855 --> 00:55:40,423
- Wait. - They aren't on our team.

1639
00:55:40,424 --> 00:55:41,753
- Wait a minute. - They could be on that team.

1640
00:55:41,754 --> 00:55:45,054
When Se Chan and I were playing a moment ago,

1641
00:55:45,055 --> 00:55:47,563
Se Chan picked this team.

1642
00:55:47,564 --> 00:55:51,110
However, he joined our team despite his choice.

1643
00:55:51,335 --> 00:55:52,403
I don't think that's it.

1644
00:55:52,404 --> 00:55:54,503
What do you mean? He joined our team.

1645
00:55:54,504 --> 00:55:56,403
(Stop, Kwang Soo. That's not it.)

1646
00:55:56,404 --> 00:55:57,434
(He gets furious.)

1647
00:55:57,435 --> 00:55:58,780
What do you mean?

1648
00:55:59,274 --> 00:56:01,543
I'm making a good inference. What do you mean that's not it?

1649
00:56:01,544 --> 00:56:02,644
(Jae Seok gives Kwang Soo a hard time.)

1650
00:56:02,645 --> 00:56:04,974
He's like a poisonous snake.

1651
00:56:04,975 --> 00:56:07,784
He waits until Kwang Soo talks and attacks him...

1652
00:56:07,785 --> 00:56:08,954
right away.

1653
00:56:08,955 --> 00:56:11,923
It's possible that the thieves intended not to clear the mission.

1654
00:56:11,924 --> 00:56:13,784
- It's possible. - Right.

1655
00:56:13,785 --> 00:56:15,954
- I agree with that. They didn't. - That's amazing.

1656
00:56:15,955 --> 00:56:17,153
- I also thought so. - Were they pretending?

1657
00:56:17,154 --> 00:56:18,593
Yes, I also thought so.

1658
00:56:18,594 --> 00:56:21,164
The situation wasn't apt for the mission.

1659
00:56:21,165 --> 00:56:23,693
- They meant to skip it. - Round Two is over.

1660
00:56:23,694 --> 00:56:26,204
I'll announce the number of individuals' gold bars.

1661
00:56:26,205 --> 00:56:27,764
- Individual? - How many we have?

1662
00:56:27,765 --> 00:56:29,704
I'm really curious about this.

1663
00:56:29,705 --> 00:56:32,150
- Did we start with 10? - Yes.

1664
00:56:32,944 --> 00:56:34,220
Kwang Soo.

1665
00:56:34,645 --> 00:56:37,150
(Members find out how many gold bars that they have.)

1666
00:56:37,875 --> 00:56:39,660
(It's announced to 9 members.)

1667
00:56:40,185 --> 00:56:41,919
(Last is Jae Seok's turn.)

1668
00:56:42,085 --> 00:56:43,684
(Jae Seok listens to the director.)

1669
00:56:43,685 --> 00:56:45,153
Who stole...

1670
00:56:45,154 --> 00:56:47,383
(He raises his voice suddenly.)

1671
00:56:47,384 --> 00:56:49,023
- What? - Jae Seok.

1672
00:56:49,024 --> 00:56:50,224
- What is it? - Stop acting.

1673
00:56:50,225 --> 00:56:51,653
- Stop it. - Don't act.

1674
00:56:51,654 --> 00:56:53,193
You're acting very strange.

1675
00:56:53,194 --> 00:56:55,139
Who stole mine?

1676
00:56:55,294 --> 00:56:56,334
- Yours? - He's acting strange.

1677
00:56:56,335 --> 00:56:57,693
- He's acting. - I'm serious.

1678
00:56:57,694 --> 00:56:59,604
- He's definitely acting... - Think about it.

1679
00:56:59,605 --> 00:57:01,934
- based on the tone of his voice. - Only four got taken.

1680
00:57:01,935 --> 00:57:04,574
Many people must be protecting their gold bars.

1681
00:57:04,575 --> 00:57:06,173
Mine got stolen.

1682
00:57:06,174 --> 00:57:07,849
I was a target for someone's mission.

1683
00:57:07,975 --> 00:57:09,974
- What? - Someone stole from me.

1684
00:57:09,975 --> 00:57:11,213
Did yours get stolen?

1685
00:57:11,214 --> 00:57:12,244
Yes.

1686
00:57:12,245 --> 00:57:14,144
I was also a target. Mine got stolen too.

1687
00:57:14,145 --> 00:57:16,014
I'm thinking carefully.

1688
00:57:16,015 --> 00:57:17,483
- How many do you have? - I have nine.

1689
00:57:17,484 --> 00:57:18,854
- I have nine. - I got one stolen.

1690
00:57:18,855 --> 00:57:19,854
- I have 9. - I have 9.

1691
00:57:19,855 --> 00:57:21,023
Who's the last person?

1692
00:57:21,024 --> 00:57:22,193
That's nonsense.

1693
00:57:22,194 --> 00:57:23,494
I have eight.

1694
00:57:23,495 --> 00:57:25,593
(Two of his gold bars were stolen.)

1695
00:57:25,594 --> 00:57:26,764
- What? - That's nonsense.

1696
00:57:26,765 --> 00:57:28,164
- Wait. - Seriously.

1697
00:57:28,165 --> 00:57:30,193
- All of you are liars. - Wait a minute.

1698
00:57:30,194 --> 00:57:32,164
- One of you is a thief. - It's one of us.

1699
00:57:32,165 --> 00:57:33,863
- There's definitely one among them. - Please.

1700
00:57:33,864 --> 00:57:35,673
- I swear to you. - How can it be five?

1701
00:57:35,674 --> 00:57:37,003
- Listen. - I swore.

1702
00:57:37,004 --> 00:57:38,374
Stay out of it, Se Chan.

1703
00:57:38,375 --> 00:57:41,244
- Wait a minute. - I'm being honest.

1704
00:57:41,245 --> 00:57:42,773
One of them is definitely a thief.

1705
00:57:42,774 --> 00:57:44,144
- Jae Seok, I swear to you. - It's one of them.

1706
00:57:44,145 --> 00:57:45,843
- I'm being honest. - I swear.

1707
00:57:45,844 --> 00:57:48,590
Listen, there should be four.

1708
00:57:48,654 --> 00:57:52,229
Someone who said that they're missing one is...

1709
00:57:52,384 --> 00:57:53,423
pretending.

1710
00:57:53,424 --> 00:57:54,483
- He's a culprit. - What about you?

1711
00:57:54,484 --> 00:57:55,693
- Why did you exclude yourself? - Why aren't you a thief?

1712
00:57:55,694 --> 00:57:57,023
No, Seok Jin.

1713
00:57:57,024 --> 00:57:58,994
Don't you trust me?

1714
00:57:58,995 --> 00:58:00,240
What's with the tone?

1715
00:58:01,424 --> 00:58:03,963
(Gosh, don't you trust me?)

1716
00:58:03,964 --> 00:58:05,164
(What's with his tone?)

1717
00:58:05,165 --> 00:58:06,664
Seok Jin.

1718
00:58:06,665 --> 00:58:08,874
- What was that? - "Don't you trust me?"

1719
00:58:08,875 --> 00:58:10,403
Why are you talking like that?

1720
00:58:10,404 --> 00:58:11,733
Do you trust him?

1721
00:58:11,734 --> 00:58:13,843
- I have eight. - He sounded like a woman.

1722
00:58:13,844 --> 00:58:16,113
- Are you a woman? - I have eight.

1723
00:58:16,114 --> 00:58:19,084
The winning team can swap one member.

1724
00:58:19,085 --> 00:58:21,843
- It's one of them. - This is driving me crazy.

1725
00:58:21,844 --> 00:58:23,883
- Goodness. - I have a feeling that...

1726
00:58:23,884 --> 00:58:25,753
- it's him. - Who?

1727
00:58:25,754 --> 00:58:27,124
- Se Chan. - I agree.

1728
00:58:27,125 --> 00:58:29,423
We'll swap Se Chan with Seok Jin.

1729
00:58:29,424 --> 00:58:31,753
Okay, we can swap these two.

1730
00:58:31,754 --> 00:58:34,570
- Let's see who aren't thieves. - Like this?

1731
00:58:34,765 --> 00:58:36,394
- Then we can decide. - All right.

1732
00:58:36,395 --> 00:58:37,910
- Let's put them on one team. - Right.

1733
00:58:37,964 --> 00:58:39,503
- Will you swap him with So Min? - With So Min.

1734
00:58:39,504 --> 00:58:41,903
- Go over there. - All of us are thieves.

1735
00:58:41,904 --> 00:58:43,434
- Why are we all thieves? - I'm not it.

1736
00:58:43,435 --> 00:58:45,673
- No way. - Isn't that too harsh?

1737
00:58:45,674 --> 00:58:47,173
- We're ready. - All right.

1738
00:58:47,174 --> 00:58:49,574
Se Chan and So Min will change their outfit.

1739
00:58:49,575 --> 00:58:51,919
We'll get in the car and move to the restaurant.

1740
00:58:52,444 --> 00:58:54,860
(Next, they go to eat.)

1741
00:58:55,384 --> 00:58:58,383
Team Min Si gets to eat and switch team members.

1742
00:58:58,384 --> 00:58:59,753
Yes.

1743
00:58:59,754 --> 00:59:02,269
- Let's go. - It's a grilled eel restaurant.

1744
00:59:02,325 --> 00:59:04,124
Will they be eating next to us?

1745
00:59:04,125 --> 00:59:05,394
Yes, they will be next to us.

1746
00:59:05,395 --> 00:59:07,063
That's pitiful.

1747
00:59:07,064 --> 00:59:09,394
This is so harsh.

1748
00:59:09,395 --> 00:59:12,104
They get that and we get this?

1749
00:59:12,105 --> 00:59:13,903
(Boiling spicy catfish stew)

1750
00:59:13,904 --> 00:59:15,950
It must be catfish stew.

1751
00:59:16,435 --> 00:59:18,410
Gosh, what is it? It's eel.

1752
00:59:18,875 --> 00:59:21,419
- It's eel. - Goodness.

1753
00:59:21,975 --> 00:59:25,113
Excuse me, could you add sesame oil in soy sauce?

1754
00:59:25,114 --> 00:59:28,720
Spicy chili in sesame oil is very delicious.

1755
00:59:29,384 --> 00:59:30,789
Will Min Si give some to us?

1756
00:59:31,384 --> 00:59:32,700
Min Si.

1757
00:59:33,024 --> 00:59:35,593
- Min Si, can you give me some? - Can you give me some?

1758
00:59:35,594 --> 00:59:36,729
Can you give me some?

1759
00:59:37,895 --> 00:59:39,369
That's for him.

1760
00:59:40,395 --> 00:59:41,664
Min Si.

1761
00:59:41,665 --> 00:59:43,334
(As she delivers the food, Seok Jin grabs her.)

1762
00:59:43,335 --> 00:59:45,309
(Seok Jin blocks her.)

1763
00:59:46,564 --> 00:59:47,863
How could you?

1764
00:59:47,864 --> 00:59:49,749
(How could you take it?)

1765
00:59:49,875 --> 00:59:51,633
How could you, Seok Jin?

1766
00:59:51,634 --> 00:59:52,780
What is this?

1767
00:59:53,075 --> 00:59:54,204
- What? - What is this?

1768
00:59:54,205 --> 00:59:56,313
- Viewers. - It's just ginger.

1769
00:59:56,314 --> 00:59:57,820
It only has ginger inside.

1770
00:59:58,444 --> 00:59:59,483
That's amazing.

1771
00:59:59,484 --> 01:00:02,043
Nice, Min Si. That was great.

1772
01:00:02,044 --> 01:00:03,490
- Good job. - It was ginger.

1773
01:00:03,685 --> 01:00:05,289
I never had a ginger wrap before.

1774
01:00:05,484 --> 01:00:06,784
Goodness.

1775
01:00:06,785 --> 01:00:09,093
- Seok Jin. - That was annoying.

1776
01:00:09,094 --> 01:00:10,829
That's amazing.

1777
01:00:11,694 --> 01:00:13,593
- That ginger is strong. - Gosh.

1778
01:00:13,594 --> 01:00:14,593
(She delivers eel.)

1779
01:00:14,594 --> 01:00:15,693
- Thank you, Min Si. - Min Si.

1780
01:00:15,694 --> 01:00:18,139
- Have some. - Min Si.

1781
01:00:18,594 --> 01:00:20,740
- Let's share it. - Yes, let's share it.

1782
01:00:20,805 --> 01:00:22,579
Min Si, thank you.

1783
01:00:22,674 --> 01:00:23,974
I got some.

1784
01:00:23,975 --> 01:00:24,974
(It looks delicious.)

1785
01:00:24,975 --> 01:00:28,749
(He blocks him completely.)

1786
01:00:29,844 --> 01:00:32,220
(It's so delicious.)

1787
01:00:32,785 --> 01:00:35,019
(Why can't he eat any?)

1788
01:00:35,484 --> 01:00:36,914
Goodness.

1789
01:00:36,915 --> 01:00:39,400
(You terrible boys)

1790
01:00:39,825 --> 01:00:41,023
(They don't know how to react to such a compliment.)

1791
01:00:41,024 --> 01:00:44,900
I wanted some because my tongue was burning after the ginger.

1792
01:00:45,125 --> 01:00:46,639
My goodness.

1793
01:00:47,194 --> 01:00:49,693
- Ask Min Si. - Make an acrostic poem with Min Si.

1794
01:00:49,694 --> 01:00:51,139
Okay.

1795
01:00:51,234 --> 01:00:52,639
Freshwater eel.

1796
01:00:53,305 --> 01:00:54,304
I hate it.

1797
01:00:54,305 --> 01:00:57,604
(Freshwater eel, I hate it.)

1798
01:00:57,605 --> 01:00:59,079
(Laughing)

1799
01:01:00,875 --> 01:01:02,079
Can you give me some?

1800
01:01:02,944 --> 01:01:04,943
- He's so arrogant. - Give me some.

1801
01:01:04,944 --> 01:01:06,360
- I'll do it. - Okay.

1802
01:01:06,384 --> 01:01:07,584
"Give me some"?

1803
01:01:07,585 --> 01:01:08,660
(Seok Jin gives it a try.)

1804
01:01:09,314 --> 01:01:11,383
- "Min". - Min Si's face.

1805
01:01:11,384 --> 01:01:14,153
- "Si". - Beautiful beyond time and space.

1806
01:01:14,154 --> 01:01:16,593
(Min Si's face, beautiful beyond time and space)

1807
01:01:16,594 --> 01:01:19,193
(She's satisfied with his acrostic poem.)

1808
01:01:19,194 --> 01:01:21,324
Isn't it too old-fashioned?

1809
01:01:21,325 --> 01:01:23,139
He sounded like an old fart.

1810
01:01:23,395 --> 01:01:25,470
Min Si gave a lot.

1811
01:01:26,564 --> 01:01:30,110
(Their fight for eel is beyond time and space.)

1812
01:01:31,075 --> 01:01:32,744
(He defends the eel with all his might.)

1813
01:01:32,745 --> 01:01:34,403
- I want some. - I want some.

1814
01:01:34,404 --> 01:01:35,744
Hey!

1815
01:01:35,745 --> 01:01:36,950
I want some.

1816
01:01:38,375 --> 01:01:41,284
(He couldn't eat any.)

1817
01:01:41,285 --> 01:01:44,860
(The bitter taste of ginger remains in his mouth.)

1818
01:01:45,884 --> 01:01:47,023
(That's hilarious.)

1819
01:01:47,024 --> 01:01:48,800
It was my acrostic poem.

1820
01:01:50,325 --> 01:01:51,324
(It's so delicious.)

1821
01:01:51,325 --> 01:01:52,570
How dare you?

1822
01:01:53,564 --> 01:01:55,593
(Life is more bitter than ginger.)

1823
01:01:55,594 --> 01:01:56,809
That's funny.

1824
01:01:57,194 --> 01:01:59,963
Wait, is the hidden mission still happening?

1825
01:01:59,964 --> 01:02:01,704
- What? - What are we doing?

1826
01:02:01,705 --> 01:02:03,503
Right? Wait, look carefully.

1827
01:02:03,504 --> 01:02:05,204
(Are the thieves on their hidden mission?)

1828
01:02:05,205 --> 01:02:08,220
I don't think there will be any change.

1829
01:02:08,404 --> 01:02:10,574
Everyone, you finished eating.

1830
01:02:10,575 --> 01:02:14,014
Thieves will temporarily stop their hidden mission now.

1831
01:02:14,015 --> 01:02:15,653
- Did they clear it? - Did they clear it again?

1832
01:02:15,654 --> 01:02:16,684
If they did, I'd be surprised.

1833
01:02:16,685 --> 01:02:19,954
I'll announce the thieves' current number of gold bars.

1834
01:02:19,955 --> 01:02:21,023
I bet it's still four.

1835
01:02:21,024 --> 01:02:24,394
The current number of gold bars that the thieves have...

1836
01:02:24,395 --> 01:02:26,570
(There won't be any change if all thieves are on one team.)

1837
01:02:27,594 --> 01:02:30,863
(The current number of gold bars that the thieves have)

1838
01:02:30,864 --> 01:02:32,563
- They have 10. - What?

1839
01:02:32,564 --> 01:02:34,204
(The current number is 10.)

1840
01:02:34,205 --> 01:02:35,204
(10 gold bars?)

1841
01:02:35,205 --> 01:02:36,304
When?

1842
01:02:36,305 --> 01:02:37,479
Did they finish all the missions?

1843
01:02:37,504 --> 01:02:39,273
Did they clear all six missions?

1844
01:02:39,274 --> 01:02:42,144
- When did they do it? - They're doing well.

1845
01:02:42,145 --> 01:02:44,090
What's the name of today's special?

1846
01:02:44,274 --> 01:02:46,043
Catch the Thieves Right Under Our Nose.

1847
01:02:46,044 --> 01:02:47,084
- "Thieves"? - What?

1848
01:02:47,085 --> 01:02:48,383
- The nose. - What?

1849
01:02:48,384 --> 01:02:49,753
Is it touching the nose?

1850
01:02:49,754 --> 01:02:52,213
Is it touching the eyes or the nose?

1851
01:02:52,214 --> 01:02:53,584
- Jong Kook. - What?

1852
01:02:53,585 --> 01:02:55,124
You kept touching your eyes.

1853
01:02:55,125 --> 01:02:56,394
(You kept touching your eyes.)

1854
01:02:56,395 --> 01:02:57,394
(Is Jong Kook the thief?)

1855
01:02:57,395 --> 01:02:58,423
What did he do, Ji Hyo?

1856
01:02:58,424 --> 01:03:00,494
Jong Kook kept touching his eyes.

1857
01:03:00,495 --> 01:03:03,293
- It's okay to touch your own eyes. - Right.

1858
01:03:03,294 --> 01:03:06,133
- You have to touch other people's. - Ji Hyo.

1859
01:03:06,134 --> 01:03:08,233
Who switched with Se Chan?

1860
01:03:08,234 --> 01:03:09,704
I got switched.

1861
01:03:09,705 --> 01:03:11,704
- So Min and Se Chan switched. - I got switched.

1862
01:03:11,705 --> 01:03:13,204
- Wait. - No.

1863
01:03:13,205 --> 01:03:15,003
It's either Se Chan or So Min.

1864
01:03:15,004 --> 01:03:16,113
Me?

1865
01:03:16,114 --> 01:03:17,213
- All right. - It's not me.

1866
01:03:17,214 --> 01:03:19,584
- I think it's So Min. - That's right.

1867
01:03:19,585 --> 01:03:22,184
- I think it's So Min. It's creepy. - Right.

1868
01:03:22,185 --> 01:03:24,684
I pretended to tear off her name tag like this...

1869
01:03:24,685 --> 01:03:27,483
a moment ago as if I was on a mission.

1870
01:03:27,484 --> 01:03:29,293
However, she didn't react at all.

1871
01:03:29,294 --> 01:03:31,653
She's a thief, so she knows who it is.

1872
01:03:31,654 --> 01:03:32,793
Is that why she isn't scared?

1873
01:03:32,794 --> 01:03:35,494
- She knows who the thief is. - I think it's Se Chan.

1874
01:03:35,495 --> 01:03:37,269
I think it's Se Chan.

1875
01:03:37,294 --> 01:03:39,804
- Is it Se Chan? - It's because in the beginning...

1876
01:03:39,805 --> 01:03:41,334
- No. - you chose a team.

1877
01:03:41,335 --> 01:03:43,133
So Min is suspicious.

1878
01:03:43,134 --> 01:03:45,773
Why do you keep saying that it's me, Kwang Soo?

1879
01:03:45,774 --> 01:03:47,644
- I'm not it. - If it's So Min...

1880
01:03:47,645 --> 01:03:49,014
I'm not it.

1881
01:03:49,015 --> 01:03:51,273
The thieves have completed their task...

1882
01:03:51,274 --> 01:03:54,213
and will win as long as they aren't arrested.

1883
01:03:54,214 --> 01:03:57,590
With the last round remaining, Team Min Si has the right...

1884
01:03:57,714 --> 01:04:00,930
to switch members with the other team.

1885
01:04:01,055 --> 01:04:03,329
The situation needs to change for the better, right?

1886
01:04:03,924 --> 01:04:06,423
What's the point of switching team members?

1887
01:04:06,424 --> 01:04:08,164
Only the arrested thief's gold bars...

1888
01:04:08,165 --> 01:04:10,593
- get taken away. - I see.

1889
01:04:10,594 --> 01:04:12,269
Even if one thief gets arrested,

1890
01:04:13,064 --> 01:04:15,809
- the other one can meet the number. - You are right.

1891
01:04:16,504 --> 01:04:19,474
(They can't let their guards down until the next game.)

1892
01:04:19,475 --> 01:04:21,244
- I want to switch So Min... - Why me?

1893
01:04:21,245 --> 01:04:22,380
Why me?

1894
01:04:22,844 --> 01:04:24,173
- with Jae Seok. - Me?

1895
01:04:24,174 --> 01:04:25,713
(She switches So Min with Jae Seok.)

1896
01:04:25,714 --> 01:04:27,289
Then this team will be too weak.

1897
01:04:28,044 --> 01:04:30,184
How are we supposed to compete?

1898
01:04:30,185 --> 01:04:31,554
Now,

1899
01:04:31,555 --> 01:04:34,483
Team Bo Ra will be the weakest.

1900
01:04:34,484 --> 01:04:35,824
If Jae Seok leaves and So Min comes...

1901
01:04:35,825 --> 01:04:37,599
(Mumbling)

1902
01:04:37,694 --> 01:04:39,494
If Jae Seok leaves and So Min comes...

1903
01:04:39,495 --> 01:04:41,264
(Se Chan becomes hasty when the members are switched.)

1904
01:04:41,265 --> 01:04:42,439
So Min...

1905
01:04:42,995 --> 01:04:44,193
(A few hours ago)

1906
01:04:44,194 --> 01:04:45,410
Do the calculations.

1907
01:04:45,904 --> 01:04:48,604
Today, you will divide into 2 teams of 5...

1908
01:04:48,605 --> 01:04:50,709
and participate in Catch the Thieves Right Under Our Nose.

1909
01:04:50,904 --> 01:04:54,479
The two of you are thieves who want to steal gold bars.

1910
01:04:55,814 --> 01:04:57,773
Se Chan, this is your hidden mission.

1911
01:04:57,774 --> 01:05:02,320
Say a member's name followed by a popular line of a movie.

1912
01:05:02,415 --> 01:05:04,184
Jae Seok, come here. This is incredible.

1913
01:05:04,185 --> 01:05:05,213
So you chose to be with your girlfriend.

1914
01:05:05,214 --> 01:05:08,284
Nice! Min Si, this is incredible. Good job. Good shot.

1915
01:05:08,285 --> 01:05:12,329
(He carried out the hidden mission without getting caught.)

1916
01:05:13,665 --> 01:05:15,963
- Let's change. - Once the two of them change,

1917
01:05:15,964 --> 01:05:19,139
- we will move to the last location. - I have no idea.

1918
01:05:19,564 --> 01:05:20,834
I know what this is.

1919
01:05:20,835 --> 01:05:23,050
Isn't that a trampoline? What is that?

1920
01:05:23,075 --> 01:05:25,380
- It's a volleyball. - Isn't that a trampoline?

1921
01:05:25,404 --> 01:05:26,403
It's not a trampoline.

1922
01:05:26,404 --> 01:05:28,503
This is quite popular these days.

1923
01:05:28,504 --> 01:05:29,713
- Really? - Yes, it's quite popular.

1924
01:05:29,714 --> 01:05:31,273
I will explain the rules.

1925
01:05:31,274 --> 01:05:34,289
The thieves can do their hidden missions from now on.

1926
01:05:35,085 --> 01:05:37,389
The final mission is Spike Man.

1927
01:05:37,455 --> 01:05:38,854
- What? - Spike Man.

1928
01:05:38,855 --> 01:05:42,124
We prepared this game thanks to Haha's tip-off.

1929
01:05:42,125 --> 01:05:44,354
It's spikeball. We will show you the video.

1930
01:05:44,355 --> 01:05:45,630
Can everyone see it?

1931
01:05:46,125 --> 01:05:48,293
Bounce the ball off the net and receive it like volleyball.

1932
01:05:48,294 --> 01:05:49,664
(Use the trampoline to toss the ball to the opposing team.)

1933
01:05:49,665 --> 01:05:51,793
(If they fail to receive the ball, you score a point.)

1934
01:05:51,794 --> 01:05:53,840
- You have to bounce it off the net. - I see.

1935
01:05:54,435 --> 01:05:56,204
- Can you use your head? - You can only use your hands.

1936
01:05:56,205 --> 01:05:57,773
- This man used his head. - Really?

1937
01:05:57,774 --> 01:05:58,773
You can use every part of your body.

1938
01:05:58,774 --> 01:06:00,650
It's like a combination of volleyball and table tennis.

1939
01:06:00,944 --> 01:06:02,119
It's like volleyball.

1940
01:06:02,404 --> 01:06:03,650
- That's right. Try it. - Try it.

1941
01:06:04,174 --> 01:06:06,244
- There you go. - Receive the ball.

1942
01:06:06,245 --> 01:06:08,459
(He needs to receive the ball.)

1943
01:06:08,915 --> 01:06:10,483
(The ball goes past him.)

1944
01:06:10,484 --> 01:06:11,760
Receive the ball.

1945
01:06:12,214 --> 01:06:14,329
- It flew towards my chest. - Go and get the ball.

1946
01:06:14,654 --> 01:06:16,153
Go and get the ball.

1947
01:06:16,154 --> 01:06:18,854
- Kwang Soo went. - Why won't you go and get it?

1948
01:06:18,855 --> 01:06:20,039
You never go.

1949
01:06:20,064 --> 01:06:21,624
- Seok Jin, come here. - You are an old fart.

1950
01:06:21,625 --> 01:06:22,733
(Stop getting scolded and come here.)

1951
01:06:22,734 --> 01:06:23,963
We are weak.

1952
01:06:23,964 --> 01:06:26,104
Since there are no boundaries, you need to receive the ball...

1953
01:06:26,105 --> 01:06:27,403
no matter what.

1954
01:06:27,404 --> 01:06:30,304
We should spread out. One person in the back.

1955
01:06:30,305 --> 01:06:31,374
I understood the rules now.

1956
01:06:31,375 --> 01:06:33,720
The winning team will receive a hint on the thieves.

1957
01:06:33,944 --> 01:06:35,419
We need to watch the ball.

1958
01:06:35,444 --> 01:06:36,843
- Go back. - Let's go.

1959
01:06:36,844 --> 01:06:38,144
We can't hit it right away, right?

1960
01:06:38,145 --> 01:06:40,919
- You need to hit it onto the net. - I see.

1961
01:06:41,015 --> 01:06:43,430
(With Jae Seok's serve, the game starts.)

1962
01:06:44,254 --> 01:06:45,354
There you go.

1963
01:06:45,355 --> 01:06:46,824
(Seok Jin receives the strong serve.)

1964
01:06:46,825 --> 01:06:47,883
- All right. - Get it.

1965
01:06:47,884 --> 01:06:48,959
(They need to bounce the ball back now.)

1966
01:06:50,524 --> 01:06:52,523
(He misses big time.)

1967
01:06:52,524 --> 01:06:53,840
What are you doing?

1968
01:06:54,694 --> 01:06:55,894
- We scored. - Okay.

1969
01:06:55,895 --> 01:06:57,209
- They are really bad at this. - The score is 1 to 0.

1970
01:06:57,364 --> 01:06:58,693
What was this?

1971
01:06:58,694 --> 01:06:59,979
(You're the one who introduced the game.)

1972
01:07:00,734 --> 01:07:03,074
Wasn't that a dance move?

1973
01:07:03,075 --> 01:07:04,180
Haha.

1974
01:07:04,404 --> 01:07:05,804
Wasn't that a dance move?

1975
01:07:05,805 --> 01:07:06,919
That startled me.

1976
01:07:06,944 --> 01:07:07,974
- Should I serve? - Yes.

1977
01:07:07,975 --> 01:07:10,244
He might hit it hard. No, he will hit it lightly.

1978
01:07:10,245 --> 01:07:11,574
(When Seok Jin moves back,)

1979
01:07:11,575 --> 01:07:14,090
(he gives the ball a gentle tap.)

1980
01:07:16,384 --> 01:07:18,414
- Okay! - Come on.

1981
01:07:18,415 --> 01:07:20,300
Seok Jin, I told you he will hit it lightly.

1982
01:07:20,325 --> 01:07:21,784
- Come on. - My goodness.

1983
01:07:21,785 --> 01:07:23,023
Don't use that kind of trick.

1984
01:07:23,024 --> 01:07:24,854
Why? It was really fun.

1985
01:07:24,855 --> 01:07:26,624
- Don't play dirty... - Everyone was impressed.

1986
01:07:26,625 --> 01:07:28,324
when you are a big guy.

1987
01:07:28,325 --> 01:07:29,740
Give it to me.

1988
01:07:29,794 --> 01:07:30,963
Everyone was impressed.

1989
01:07:30,964 --> 01:07:32,269
(Here you go.)

1990
01:07:32,904 --> 01:07:34,403
(He takes out his anger on Jae Seok.)

1991
01:07:34,404 --> 01:07:35,434
What are you doing?

1992
01:07:35,435 --> 01:07:37,410
Why are you taking out your anger on Jae Seok?

1993
01:07:37,875 --> 01:07:39,244
- It was a fake. - You are a bully!

1994
01:07:39,245 --> 01:07:40,820
It was a fake.

1995
01:07:40,844 --> 01:07:43,014
- Okay, okay. - He is a bully.

1996
01:07:43,015 --> 01:07:44,113
Okay.

1997
01:07:44,114 --> 01:07:45,144
Let's go.

1998
01:07:45,145 --> 01:07:46,889
(Team Min Si serves again!)

1999
01:07:47,214 --> 01:07:49,090
(Jong Kook serves fast towards Seok Jin.)

2000
01:07:49,285 --> 01:07:50,383
Why does it keep coming to me?

2001
01:07:50,384 --> 01:07:52,253
(He writhes to survive.)

2002
01:07:52,254 --> 01:07:53,883
You did it! You did it!

2003
01:07:53,884 --> 01:07:55,130
(However)

2004
01:07:55,424 --> 01:07:56,570
Why does it keep coming to me?

2005
01:07:57,294 --> 01:08:00,070
(It lands in the corner of the net.)

2006
01:08:00,524 --> 01:08:04,070
(Seok Jin's survival instinct gave the team the first point.)

2007
01:08:04,495 --> 01:08:05,769
He touched it twice.

2008
01:08:05,835 --> 01:08:07,280
It hit his head.

2009
01:08:07,464 --> 01:08:09,680
- We did it. - It hit his head.

2010
01:08:09,835 --> 01:08:11,550
It hit his head.

2011
01:08:11,904 --> 01:08:13,519
It hit his head.

2012
01:08:13,745 --> 01:08:15,579
- That was incredible. - This is hilarious.

2013
01:08:15,745 --> 01:08:16,919
Right?

2014
01:08:17,444 --> 01:08:18,619
- Let's go. - Okay.

2015
01:08:18,714 --> 01:08:19,784
Let's go.

2016
01:08:19,785 --> 01:08:20,889
I will serve.

2017
01:08:21,114 --> 01:08:22,313
(Seok Jin serves.)

2018
01:08:22,314 --> 01:08:23,490
- There you go. - I will serve.

2019
01:08:24,254 --> 01:08:26,483
(The 54-year-old serves.)

2020
01:08:26,484 --> 01:08:27,599
There you go.

2021
01:08:27,925 --> 01:08:29,294
(It hits Jong Kook's face.)

2022
01:08:29,295 --> 01:08:31,070
(This could be a meme.)

2023
01:08:32,154 --> 01:08:33,164
There you go.

2024
01:08:33,165 --> 01:08:34,269
They touched the ball twice.

2025
01:08:35,795 --> 01:08:37,439
(Overjoyed)

2026
01:08:38,135 --> 01:08:40,910
(Gosh, Min Si.)

2027
01:08:42,535 --> 01:08:46,204
(A herbivore suddenly runs around the field.)

2028
01:08:46,205 --> 01:08:47,379
It hit his face.

2029
01:08:47,604 --> 01:08:49,719
Because it hit Jong Kook's face,

2030
01:08:49,745 --> 01:08:51,374
- Kwang Soo is happy. - He is on the same team.

2031
01:08:51,375 --> 01:08:52,544
(He manages to stay calm.)

2032
01:08:52,545 --> 01:08:54,244
- Nice. - So Min.

2033
01:08:54,245 --> 01:08:56,183
Let's double it!

2034
01:08:56,184 --> 01:08:58,053
(Se Chan carries on with his hidden mission.)

2035
01:08:58,054 --> 01:08:59,129
Let's double it!

2036
01:09:00,524 --> 01:09:02,030
Haha, let's double it.

2037
01:09:02,054 --> 01:09:03,700
- Haha, let's double it. - Okay.

2038
01:09:04,154 --> 01:09:05,254
My goodness.

2039
01:09:05,255 --> 01:09:06,393
(While everyone is absorbed in the game,)

2040
01:09:06,394 --> 01:09:08,494
(he says the famous line of a movie.)

2041
01:09:08,495 --> 01:09:10,263
Seok Jin, you should have doubled it.

2042
01:09:10,264 --> 01:09:11,393
Don't blame me.

2043
01:09:11,394 --> 01:09:13,780
- You should have doubled it. - Seok Jin.

2044
01:09:13,864 --> 01:09:15,204
I bet I am good at this.

2045
01:09:15,205 --> 01:09:16,479
- Go ahead. - The ball...

2046
01:09:16,505 --> 01:09:19,549
should be hit with your fist.

2047
01:09:19,575 --> 01:09:20,650
Come on out.

2048
01:09:21,045 --> 01:09:22,303
Okay. Kwang Soo, you are up.

2049
01:09:22,304 --> 01:09:23,443
(Will Se Chan do a good job?)

2050
01:09:23,444 --> 01:09:24,473
Serve.

2051
01:09:24,474 --> 01:09:26,990
(Team Bo Ra serves!)

2052
01:09:27,085 --> 01:09:28,443
Okay.

2053
01:09:28,444 --> 01:09:29,559
- There you go. - Nice.

2054
01:09:31,184 --> 01:09:32,759
- What? - Hold on.

2055
01:09:33,484 --> 01:09:34,723
(She grabs the ball...)

2056
01:09:34,724 --> 01:09:36,900
(and tosses it as if nothing happened.)

2057
01:09:37,125 --> 01:09:38,924
You touched the ball...

2058
01:09:38,925 --> 01:09:40,439
- Are you kidding me? - for too long.

2059
01:09:40,465 --> 01:09:42,424
- We didn't know. - We didn't know.

2060
01:09:42,425 --> 01:09:44,893
- Jong Kook, we are losing anyway. - They explained the rules.

2061
01:09:44,894 --> 01:09:46,664
- We didn't know. - We never played this game before.

2062
01:09:46,665 --> 01:09:48,103
Let's hear it from here. Are you sure you didn't know?

2063
01:09:48,104 --> 01:09:49,339
I didn't know.

2064
01:09:49,575 --> 01:09:50,733
(Cute)

2065
01:09:50,734 --> 01:09:52,034
Really? Are you sure you didn't know?

2066
01:09:52,035 --> 01:09:53,519
- All right. - It wasn't a mistake.

2067
01:09:53,804 --> 01:09:54,943
- We didn't know. - It won't happen again.

2068
01:09:54,944 --> 01:09:56,004
It won't happen again.

2069
01:09:56,005 --> 01:09:57,613
Don't do that from now on.

2070
01:09:57,614 --> 01:09:59,120
- Okay. - Okay.

2071
01:09:59,215 --> 01:10:00,320
Let's go.

2072
01:10:00,385 --> 01:10:01,943
We are winning.

2073
01:10:01,944 --> 01:10:02,954
I will serve.

2074
01:10:02,955 --> 01:10:04,030
Let's have a rally.

2075
01:10:05,054 --> 01:10:06,200
- That's good. - Okay.

2076
01:10:06,354 --> 01:10:07,954
(Now that they have warmed up, the rally continues on.)

2077
01:10:07,955 --> 01:10:09,129
Okay.

2078
01:10:09,184 --> 01:10:10,223
Okay.

2079
01:10:10,224 --> 01:10:11,799
- Check the camera. - Okay, okay.

2080
01:10:13,165 --> 01:10:15,723
(Jae Seok put the ball in the corner!)

2081
01:10:15,724 --> 01:10:17,170
(It was an incredible shot.)

2082
01:10:17,965 --> 01:10:20,464
Okay. Okay.

2083
01:10:20,465 --> 01:10:21,733
That was good.

2084
01:10:21,734 --> 01:10:22,973
- Okay. - It hit the camera.

2085
01:10:22,974 --> 01:10:23,973
It was cool.

2086
01:10:23,974 --> 01:10:25,034
It was impressive.

2087
01:10:25,035 --> 01:10:26,244
- All right. - It was a good save.

2088
01:10:26,245 --> 01:10:28,704
He is like Maria Sharapova.

2089
01:10:28,705 --> 01:10:30,313
(Why did he suddenly mention Maria Sharapova?)

2090
01:10:30,314 --> 01:10:31,473
- Maria Sharapova? - Maria Sharapova?

2091
01:10:31,474 --> 01:10:33,183
- Maria Sharapova! - What?

2092
01:10:33,184 --> 01:10:34,660
Maria Sharapova.

2093
01:10:34,885 --> 01:10:36,629
- This is good. - All right. Okay.

2094
01:10:36,654 --> 01:10:37,784
This won't do.

2095
01:10:37,785 --> 01:10:39,954
- Women should enter the game. - That's right.

2096
01:10:39,955 --> 01:10:42,153
(Why don't the women play as well?)

2097
01:10:42,154 --> 01:10:43,670
- We won't add women. - We will go with this combination.

2098
01:10:44,224 --> 01:10:45,324
- What? - We will go as we are.

2099
01:10:45,325 --> 01:10:47,223
(Flustered)

2100
01:10:47,224 --> 01:10:48,523
- What? - We will go as we are.

2101
01:10:48,524 --> 01:10:50,164
All right.

2102
01:10:50,165 --> 01:10:51,410
We will go as we are.

2103
01:10:51,635 --> 01:10:53,103
(A powerful serve)

2104
01:10:53,104 --> 01:10:54,280
- Okay. - Nice.

2105
01:10:54,304 --> 01:10:55,733
- Okay. - Send the ball towards Ji Hyo.

2106
01:10:55,734 --> 01:10:57,210
- Send the ball towards Ji Hyo. - That's right.

2107
01:10:57,604 --> 01:10:58,849
(They are so petty.)

2108
01:10:58,875 --> 01:11:01,420
- Change the members. - What?

2109
01:11:01,474 --> 01:11:04,250
- Change the members. - We are healthy players.

2110
01:11:05,514 --> 01:11:06,689
For goodness' sake.

2111
01:11:07,045 --> 01:11:09,013
I know they are on my team, but they are so shameless.

2112
01:11:09,014 --> 01:11:11,689
For a while, don't check out the website's massage board.

2113
01:11:11,854 --> 01:11:13,153
(Massage board?)

2114
01:11:13,154 --> 01:11:14,400
You mean the message board.

2115
01:11:16,125 --> 01:11:17,653
(Seok Jin should take a break.)

2116
01:11:17,654 --> 01:11:18,893
What's the massage board?

2117
01:11:18,894 --> 01:11:21,070
Don't appeal to our sympathy that way.

2118
01:11:21,095 --> 01:11:22,933
- Do you need a break? - No.

2119
01:11:22,934 --> 01:11:23,964
(He stutters because he is scared.)

2120
01:11:23,965 --> 01:11:25,034
That's hilarious.

2121
01:11:25,035 --> 01:11:26,879
- That's hilarious. - The message board.

2122
01:11:27,104 --> 01:11:28,964
- Let's switch the players. - Yes.

2123
01:11:28,965 --> 01:11:30,074
Let's go. Let's go.

2124
01:11:30,075 --> 01:11:31,903
(The original members enter!)

2125
01:11:31,904 --> 01:11:32,973
Okay.

2126
01:11:32,974 --> 01:11:34,179
Kwang Soo, it's yours.

2127
01:11:34,845 --> 01:11:36,344
- You got it. - There you go.

2128
01:11:36,345 --> 01:11:38,089
(Neck-and-neck)

2129
01:11:39,045 --> 01:11:42,089
(The rally continues on.)

2130
01:11:42,745 --> 01:11:46,129
(Their skills have been upgraded.)

2131
01:11:47,285 --> 01:11:48,360
(At that moment)

2132
01:11:49,724 --> 01:11:51,299
- Okay. - This is incredible.

2133
01:11:51,854 --> 01:11:53,624
(Jae Seok misses the net.)

2134
01:11:53,625 --> 01:11:55,594
- We are winning. - Are we winning?

2135
01:11:55,595 --> 01:11:56,933
We can do this.

2136
01:11:56,934 --> 01:11:59,070
- We need 1 more point. - We need 1 more point.

2137
01:11:59,505 --> 01:12:01,433
This is your chance to look cool.

2138
01:12:01,434 --> 01:12:03,179
He is tying his shoelaces. Let's serve now.

2139
01:12:03,635 --> 01:12:06,280
(The cheating trio serves right away.)

2140
01:12:06,944 --> 01:12:09,280
(The game starts before Jong Kook gets ready.)

2141
01:12:11,045 --> 01:12:12,990
(It's a fierce match.)

2142
01:12:13,514 --> 01:12:15,759
(The onlookers become excited.)

2143
01:12:16,755 --> 01:12:19,290
(The ball goes back and forth.)

2144
01:12:19,654 --> 01:12:21,353
(Se Chan's attack...)

2145
01:12:21,354 --> 01:12:23,799
(succeeds!)

2146
01:12:25,894 --> 01:12:28,424
(Team Bo Ra takes a win from behind!)

2147
01:12:28,425 --> 01:12:30,570
- Hold on. - He was tying his shoelaces.

2148
01:12:30,595 --> 01:12:32,393
- He was tying his shoelaces. - He was tying his shoelaces.

2149
01:12:32,394 --> 01:12:34,339
- We won! - I am happy, but you are shameless.

2150
01:12:34,364 --> 01:12:36,450
- You are shameless. - We beat you.

2151
01:12:36,904 --> 01:12:38,034
He was tying his shoelaces.

2152
01:12:38,035 --> 01:12:39,874
- Come on. - We won't count that point.

2153
01:12:39,875 --> 01:12:41,473
I am impressed that they still received it.

2154
01:12:41,474 --> 01:12:43,414
(Team Bo Ra has 20 points and Team Min Si has 19 points.)

2155
01:12:43,415 --> 01:12:44,820
- Let's go. - I am out of breath.

2156
01:12:44,875 --> 01:12:46,214
I will give it to you.

2157
01:12:46,215 --> 01:12:47,744
(The blocking is fierce since they have one point to go.)

2158
01:12:47,745 --> 01:12:49,420
- No. No. - No?

2159
01:12:50,014 --> 01:12:51,183
Kwang Soo, you need to do well.

2160
01:12:51,184 --> 01:12:52,414
(Seok Jin's sudden serve...)

2161
01:12:52,415 --> 01:12:53,559
(gets returned by Jong Kook.)

2162
01:12:53,984 --> 01:12:55,223
(Jae Seok smashes the ball when it's in the air.)

2163
01:12:55,224 --> 01:12:58,053
- No, no. You touched it twice. - It's perfectly acceptable.

2164
01:12:58,054 --> 01:12:59,494
- What? - It's perfectly acceptable.

2165
01:12:59,495 --> 01:13:00,893
- We did it right. - It's perfectly acceptable.

2166
01:13:00,894 --> 01:13:02,639
- You are right. - That's right.

2167
01:13:02,694 --> 01:13:04,164
- You are right. - That's right.

2168
01:13:04,165 --> 01:13:05,594
(I can't believe him.)

2169
01:13:05,595 --> 01:13:06,933
- You are right. - That's right.

2170
01:13:06,934 --> 01:13:08,464
- You can touch it multiple times. - That's right.

2171
01:13:08,465 --> 01:13:10,634
- I am sorry. - It was between them.

2172
01:13:10,635 --> 01:13:11,750
I got confused for a second.

2173
01:13:12,035 --> 01:13:13,750
- Should we cancel? - Should we do that?

2174
01:13:14,904 --> 01:13:16,120
What do we do?

2175
01:13:16,415 --> 01:13:19,473
(Maybe we should cancel and say that we won.)

2176
01:13:19,474 --> 01:13:21,483
Did you make a reservation at a restaurant or something?

2177
01:13:21,484 --> 01:13:23,113
If we do that now, people will criticize us twice.

2178
01:13:23,114 --> 01:13:25,013
- Seriously. - If people criticize us twice,

2179
01:13:25,014 --> 01:13:26,523
- we won't be able to get back up. - Really? Okay.

2180
01:13:26,524 --> 01:13:27,629
"We won't be able to get back up."

2181
01:13:27,925 --> 01:13:28,954
We won't be able to get back up.

2182
01:13:28,955 --> 01:13:30,094
Since we are tied now, one point remains.

2183
01:13:30,095 --> 01:13:31,393
It's time for a matchpoint. There won't be a deuce.

2184
01:13:31,394 --> 01:13:32,824
- This is our last chance. - A matchpoint.

2185
01:13:32,825 --> 01:13:33,964
This is our last chance.

2186
01:13:33,965 --> 01:13:35,269
We can't back off.

2187
01:13:35,665 --> 01:13:36,794
We can't lose.

2188
01:13:36,795 --> 01:13:37,910
A matchpoint.

2189
01:13:38,135 --> 01:13:39,263
- We can't lose. - We have to win.

2190
01:13:39,264 --> 01:13:42,040
(Which team will win and receive a hint on the thieves?)

2191
01:13:43,135 --> 01:13:44,473
(Kwang Soo's sudden serve)

2192
01:13:44,474 --> 01:13:45,650
Seok Jin.

2193
01:13:45,774 --> 01:13:46,874
- Please. - Come on.

2194
01:13:46,875 --> 01:13:48,780
(Team Bo Ra carried out an attack flawlessly.)

2195
01:13:49,304 --> 01:13:51,714
(Jong Kook passes the ball to Kwang Soo.)

2196
01:13:51,715 --> 01:13:52,874
Kwang Soo.

2197
01:13:52,875 --> 01:13:54,860
(Kwang Soo's smash)

2198
01:13:55,085 --> 01:13:57,089
(The ball heads towards the corner.)

2199
01:13:58,154 --> 01:14:00,223
(If they score, Team Min Si wins.)

2200
01:14:00,224 --> 01:14:03,070
(If not, Team Bo Ra wins.)

2201
01:14:03,554 --> 01:14:06,000
(Which team will win this competition?)

2202
01:14:06,394 --> 01:14:07,500
Kwang Soo.

2203
01:14:07,864 --> 01:14:09,594
- We got it. - Okay.

2204
01:14:09,595 --> 01:14:11,139
(The ball smashes into the camera in the corner.)

2205
01:14:11,295 --> 01:14:13,280
(Nice shot)

2206
01:14:13,904 --> 01:14:15,334
(It hits the camera.)

2207
01:14:15,335 --> 01:14:16,334
(Team Min Si scores.)

2208
01:14:16,335 --> 01:14:18,150
Did we win?

2209
01:14:18,774 --> 01:14:21,004
- We won. - We won!

2210
01:14:21,005 --> 01:14:22,143
Now...

2211
01:14:22,144 --> 01:14:23,219
(Team Min Si wins.)

2212
01:14:23,774 --> 01:14:24,914
Team Min Si wins.

2213
01:14:24,915 --> 01:14:26,049
(Did we lose?)

2214
01:14:26,385 --> 01:14:28,544
- That was good. - Goodness.

2215
01:14:28,545 --> 01:14:32,353
The thieves will temporarily stop their hidden mission.

2216
01:14:32,354 --> 01:14:34,723
I completely forgot about it.

2217
01:14:34,724 --> 01:14:36,670
- We were busy with the game. - All right.

2218
01:14:36,724 --> 01:14:38,424
I'll announce the number of thieves' gold bars.

2219
01:14:38,425 --> 01:14:39,740
- Was it 10 a moment ago? - Yes.

2220
01:14:40,264 --> 01:14:42,170
The number of gold bars stolen by the thieves is...

2221
01:14:42,295 --> 01:14:43,363
How many is it?

2222
01:14:43,364 --> 01:14:44,509
It's 19.

2223
01:14:45,234 --> 01:14:46,410
What happened?

2224
01:14:46,434 --> 01:14:47,979
- Did they do it during the game? - What did they do?

2225
01:14:48,234 --> 01:14:49,403
What did they do?

2226
01:14:49,404 --> 01:14:50,879
We have to arrest them.

2227
01:14:51,335 --> 01:14:54,803
The thieves have succeeded in stealing more than 10 gold bars.

2228
01:14:54,804 --> 01:14:57,143
You'll find out how many gold bars you each have and get a hint.

2229
01:14:57,144 --> 01:14:58,950
- Then vote for the thieves. - Okay.

2230
01:14:59,474 --> 01:15:01,143
- Check how many you have. - Look at this.

2231
01:15:01,144 --> 01:15:03,254
Se Chan, you have...

2232
01:15:03,255 --> 01:15:04,330
(Everyone finds out how many they have.)

2233
01:15:05,354 --> 01:15:07,284
Team Min Si.

2234
01:15:07,285 --> 01:15:08,924
Come here and take a look at the hint.

2235
01:15:08,925 --> 01:15:10,353
- Really? - This is important.

2236
01:15:10,354 --> 01:15:11,594
It's important.

2237
01:15:11,595 --> 01:15:12,653
A hint about the thieves?

2238
01:15:12,654 --> 01:15:13,799
Here you go.

2239
01:15:14,165 --> 01:15:15,193
Thieves are...

2240
01:15:15,194 --> 01:15:18,170
(Thieves are Running Man members.)

2241
01:15:18,665 --> 01:15:20,704
(Min Si and Bo Ra are exempted.)

2242
01:15:20,705 --> 01:15:22,303
- What's the hint? - What is it? Can you share it?

2243
01:15:22,304 --> 01:15:23,433
Let's share it.

2244
01:15:23,434 --> 01:15:25,233
- Bo Ra and... - The guests are exempted.

2245
01:15:25,234 --> 01:15:26,334
The guests are exempted.

2246
01:15:26,335 --> 01:15:29,143
- They're two of the members. - I predicted that.

2247
01:15:29,144 --> 01:15:30,490
I lost more.

2248
01:15:30,514 --> 01:15:32,549
I got 3 stolen, so I have 7 left.

2249
01:15:32,575 --> 01:15:34,044
- You got three stolen. - How about you?

2250
01:15:34,045 --> 01:15:35,683
- I got two stolen. - Then...

2251
01:15:35,684 --> 01:15:37,513
I got two stolen.

2252
01:15:37,514 --> 01:15:38,914
- No way. - Really?

2253
01:15:38,915 --> 01:15:41,053
I got five stolen. What's wrong with you?

2254
01:15:41,054 --> 01:15:42,683
Why do you keep lying, everyone?

2255
01:15:42,684 --> 01:15:43,853
I got five stolen.

2256
01:15:43,854 --> 01:15:45,223
- How many is it in total? - I got three stolen.

2257
01:15:45,224 --> 01:15:46,494
I got two stolen.

2258
01:15:46,495 --> 01:15:48,164
- What about you? - The total is already 11.

2259
01:15:48,165 --> 01:15:50,193
- I still have nine. - Still?

2260
01:15:50,194 --> 01:15:51,363
I got three stolen.

2261
01:15:51,364 --> 01:15:53,863
All right, the voting will start.

2262
01:15:53,864 --> 01:15:55,334
- I have no idea. - I don't know.

2263
01:15:55,335 --> 01:15:58,134
If you pick both thieves correctly,

2264
01:15:58,135 --> 01:15:59,233
the members will win.

2265
01:15:59,234 --> 01:16:01,273
The one with the most gold bars wins a prize.

2266
01:16:01,274 --> 01:16:05,044
The one with the least gold bars will be penalized with the thieves.

2267
01:16:05,045 --> 01:16:06,683
Even if the thieves win,

2268
01:16:06,684 --> 01:16:09,389
members who correctly picked both thieves won't be penalized.

2269
01:16:09,444 --> 01:16:11,129
They won't be penalized?

2270
01:16:11,684 --> 01:16:13,700
- I have no idea. - Who is it on our team?

2271
01:16:13,955 --> 01:16:15,384
I think it's Se Chan.

2272
01:16:15,385 --> 01:16:16,954
Why does he keep suspecting me?

2273
01:16:16,955 --> 01:16:18,723
- It's Se Chan. - I think it's you.

2274
01:16:18,724 --> 01:16:20,263
What did I do?

2275
01:16:20,264 --> 01:16:21,563
Se Chan is one.

2276
01:16:21,564 --> 01:16:22,639
(He keeps acting until the end.)

2277
01:16:22,694 --> 01:16:24,240
Wait.

2278
01:16:24,734 --> 01:16:26,263
Just know that it'll be over.

2279
01:16:26,264 --> 01:16:28,204
I don't know who it is on the other team.

2280
01:16:28,205 --> 01:16:31,610
(Who is the other thief?)

2281
01:16:31,804 --> 01:16:33,143
I think...

2282
01:16:33,144 --> 01:16:34,143
(His sixth sense starts to work.)

2283
01:16:34,144 --> 01:16:35,803
It's Jae Seok on this team.

2284
01:16:35,804 --> 01:16:37,214
- Right. - I think it's Jae Seok.

2285
01:16:37,215 --> 01:16:38,643
- I swear that it's not me. - Also...

2286
01:16:38,644 --> 01:16:40,183
(Is Jae Seok a thief as Haha thinks?)

2287
01:16:40,184 --> 01:16:41,384
I don't think it's Jae Seok.

2288
01:16:41,385 --> 01:16:42,983
I don't think it's Jae Seok.

2289
01:16:42,984 --> 01:16:44,784
- Is it not? - I don't think it's him.

2290
01:16:44,785 --> 01:16:45,914
It's not me.

2291
01:16:45,915 --> 01:16:47,259
I'm really not it.

2292
01:16:47,785 --> 01:16:49,893
Why would I make it so obvious when clearing a mission?

2293
01:16:49,894 --> 01:16:51,053
(If Jae Seok isn't a thief...)

2294
01:16:51,054 --> 01:16:52,523
Is it Jong Kook?

2295
01:16:52,524 --> 01:16:53,964
I didn't do anything.

2296
01:16:53,965 --> 01:16:55,269
Isn't it you?

2297
01:16:55,425 --> 01:16:57,009
Kwang Soo, isn't it you?

2298
01:16:57,694 --> 01:16:59,540
I don't know who it is on my team.

2299
01:16:59,694 --> 01:17:01,733
- I don't think it's Kwang Soo. - It's because...

2300
01:17:01,734 --> 01:17:03,679
I have no idea who it is on my team.

2301
01:17:04,005 --> 01:17:06,110
I have no idea at all.

2302
01:17:06,135 --> 01:17:07,620
Please hand in your vote.

2303
01:17:07,804 --> 01:17:09,004
(Everyone votes for the thieves.)

2304
01:17:09,005 --> 01:17:10,273
I changed my mind so many times.

2305
01:17:10,274 --> 01:17:12,313
We'll move to the final judgment stage.

2306
01:17:12,314 --> 01:17:14,613
It'll be easy to get penalized this time.

2307
01:17:14,614 --> 01:17:18,254
- I'll announce the result. - This is very difficult.

2308
01:17:18,255 --> 01:17:20,983
One of the thief candidates received seven votes.

2309
01:17:20,984 --> 01:17:22,584
The one with seven votes...

2310
01:17:22,585 --> 01:17:25,454
(The one with seven votes)

2311
01:17:25,455 --> 01:17:27,393
- It's Se Chan. - Gosh.

2312
01:17:27,394 --> 01:17:28,540
Is it not you?

2313
01:17:28,564 --> 01:17:30,933
Did he only get seven votes?

2314
01:17:30,934 --> 01:17:34,910
The candidate to get the second most votes received five votes.

2315
01:17:35,064 --> 01:17:40,004
(Which thief candidate received 5 votes?)

2316
01:17:40,005 --> 01:17:41,179
It's Jong Kook.

2317
01:17:41,944 --> 01:17:42,943
It's Jong Kook.

2318
01:17:42,944 --> 01:17:44,450
Is it me?

2319
01:17:44,915 --> 01:17:47,113
- Did he get five votes? - Me?

2320
01:17:47,114 --> 01:17:48,920
He got more votes than I thought.

2321
01:17:50,114 --> 01:17:51,384
(Is it Jong Kook?)

2322
01:17:51,385 --> 01:17:52,759
(I voted for Jong Kook.)

2323
01:17:52,915 --> 01:17:57,099
(Jong Kook is one of the final candidates.)

2324
01:17:57,255 --> 01:17:58,853
- Jong Kook. - Did you pick me?

2325
01:17:58,854 --> 01:18:00,000
Give me your jacket.

2326
01:18:00,665 --> 01:18:01,863
I voted for you.

2327
01:18:01,864 --> 01:18:03,139
(Goodness)

2328
01:18:03,394 --> 01:18:04,563
My goodness.

2329
01:18:04,564 --> 01:18:06,634
- Let's start with Se Chan. - Why did you pick me?

2330
01:18:06,635 --> 01:18:08,763
1, 2.

2331
01:18:08,764 --> 01:18:11,210
(Se Chan is a thief.)

2332
01:18:11,734 --> 01:18:13,179
It's him, right?

2333
01:18:13,274 --> 01:18:14,443
It was me.

2334
01:18:14,444 --> 01:18:16,613
It was Se Chan.

2335
01:18:16,614 --> 01:18:19,049
Se Chan's mission was...

2336
01:18:19,114 --> 01:18:21,889
saying a member's name and a famous line from a movie.

2337
01:18:22,144 --> 01:18:23,454
He kept doing it.

2338
01:18:23,455 --> 01:18:25,584
Saying lines from movies was very hard for me.

2339
01:18:25,585 --> 01:18:26,853
The difference in score wasn't two,

2340
01:18:26,854 --> 01:18:29,424
but I kept saying, "Make it a double."

2341
01:18:29,425 --> 01:18:31,494
You said that a lot today.

2342
01:18:31,495 --> 01:18:34,200
The number of gold bars that Se Chan obtained was...

2343
01:18:34,965 --> 01:18:36,023
eight.

2344
01:18:36,024 --> 01:18:37,263
- What about 11? - What?

2345
01:18:37,264 --> 01:18:38,334
(He obtained 8 gold bars.)

2346
01:18:38,335 --> 01:18:39,433
What about 11?

2347
01:18:39,434 --> 01:18:40,803
If it isn't Jong Kook...

2348
01:18:40,804 --> 01:18:43,610
If Jong Kook isn't a thief, thieves win.

2349
01:18:44,205 --> 01:18:46,233
Did I do anything?

2350
01:18:46,234 --> 01:18:48,803
- Was I suspicious? What did I do? - I don't know.

2351
01:18:48,804 --> 01:18:50,374
- What did I do? - I don't know.

2352
01:18:50,375 --> 01:18:51,443
Why did you vote me?

2353
01:18:51,444 --> 01:18:53,113
Among members on our team, it isn't me.

2354
01:18:53,114 --> 01:18:54,983
What did I do? Was yours stolen?

2355
01:18:54,984 --> 01:18:56,013
I got seven stolen.

2356
01:18:56,014 --> 01:18:57,360
- Seven? - Yes.

2357
01:18:57,614 --> 01:18:59,454
- Did I do something to you? - I don't think so.

2358
01:18:59,455 --> 01:19:02,530
- I don't think you did anything. - Did you vote for me?

2359
01:19:03,054 --> 01:19:04,729
- Yes. - Why did you?

2360
01:19:04,955 --> 01:19:06,494
It must be Kwang Soo.

2361
01:19:06,495 --> 01:19:08,023
It could be Kwang Soo.

2362
01:19:08,024 --> 01:19:09,424
- As you said... - It's not me.

2363
01:19:09,425 --> 01:19:11,193
Actually, I suspected that...

2364
01:19:11,194 --> 01:19:13,379
it was either Jong Kook or Kwang Soo.

2365
01:19:13,465 --> 01:19:14,863
I have no idea.

2366
01:19:14,864 --> 01:19:16,134
- Let's find out. - Okay.

2367
01:19:16,135 --> 01:19:18,473
- Let's reveal his identity. - This is amazing.

2368
01:19:18,474 --> 01:19:21,150
If Jong Kook is a thief, the members arrested the thieves.

2369
01:19:21,904 --> 01:19:23,943
If not, the thieves win.

2370
01:19:23,944 --> 01:19:25,174
Tear it off, Ji Hyo.

2371
01:19:25,175 --> 01:19:26,960
- 1, 2. - I didn't do anything.

2372
01:19:27,114 --> 01:19:29,483
(Is Jong Kook a thief or is it someone else?)

2373
01:19:29,484 --> 01:19:30,513
Three.

2374
01:19:30,514 --> 01:19:31,513
(Is Jong Kook a thief or is it someone else?)

2375
01:19:31,514 --> 01:19:33,153
It must be Kwang Soo.

2376
01:19:33,154 --> 01:19:35,254
(Will the thieves who played to the end win?)

2377
01:19:35,255 --> 01:19:38,553
(Or will the members who arrested Jong Kook win?)

2378
01:19:38,554 --> 01:19:39,594
(Thief)

2379
01:19:39,595 --> 01:19:42,893
(Jong Kook is a thief.)

2380
01:19:42,894 --> 01:19:44,563
- What is it? We're right. - We're right.

2381
01:19:44,564 --> 01:19:45,563
We're right.

2382
01:19:45,564 --> 01:19:47,809
See? We're right.

2383
01:19:47,835 --> 01:19:49,334
You're right.

2384
01:19:49,335 --> 01:19:50,903
We're right. Kwang Soo.

2385
01:19:50,904 --> 01:19:52,650
I was acting.

2386
01:19:53,035 --> 01:19:54,750
Jong Kook, your hidden mission is...

2387
01:19:54,974 --> 01:19:57,973
patting the head of a member from whom you want to steal.

2388
01:19:57,974 --> 01:19:59,473
- Okay. - Thank goodness.

2389
01:19:59,474 --> 01:20:00,784
Thank goodness.

2390
01:20:00,785 --> 01:20:02,443
That's easy.

2391
01:20:02,444 --> 01:20:04,290
I'll pat Seok Jin's head.

2392
01:20:05,154 --> 01:20:06,983
(Jong Kook picked a target.)

2393
01:20:06,984 --> 01:20:08,330
(Smacking)

2394
01:20:08,885 --> 01:20:10,353
(He hits him.)

2395
01:20:10,354 --> 01:20:12,099
(Then he pats his head.)

2396
01:20:12,595 --> 01:20:14,164
(When the ball falls on Ji Hyo's head,)

2397
01:20:14,165 --> 01:20:15,740
(he acts sweet and pats her head.)

2398
01:20:16,264 --> 01:20:18,294
(Seok Jin's head)

2399
01:20:18,295 --> 01:20:21,179
(He pats his head quite aggressively.)

2400
01:20:22,005 --> 01:20:23,549
That's creepy.

2401
01:20:23,635 --> 01:20:24,903
That's creepy.

2402
01:20:24,904 --> 01:20:26,473
- It's creepy. - Goodness.

2403
01:20:26,474 --> 01:20:28,244
- When did Jong Kook do that? - I didn't do anything.

2404
01:20:28,245 --> 01:20:30,344
- I did it inconspicuously. - He didn't do anything.

2405
01:20:30,345 --> 01:20:32,420
I thought that Jong Kook was heartwarming.

2406
01:20:32,774 --> 01:20:34,113
- Like a friend... - I thought...

2407
01:20:34,114 --> 01:20:37,089
he was fixing my hair because it was messy.

2408
01:20:37,154 --> 01:20:40,559
The members won.

2409
01:20:40,854 --> 01:20:43,494
The member with the most number of gold bars is...

2410
01:20:43,495 --> 01:20:45,924
Bo Ra with 20 gold bars. She gets a prize.

2411
01:20:45,925 --> 01:20:48,063
(She's so excited.)

2412
01:20:48,064 --> 01:20:49,563
- Bo Ra is so excited. - I love it.

2413
01:20:49,564 --> 01:20:50,563
She likes it.

2414
01:20:50,564 --> 01:20:52,063
The member with the least number.

2415
01:20:52,064 --> 01:20:54,479
Most people arrested Se Chan,

2416
01:20:54,535 --> 01:20:57,174
but there's one member didn't vote for any of the thieves.

2417
01:20:57,175 --> 01:20:59,309
- Who is it? - Min Si.

2418
01:20:59,705 --> 01:21:01,080
She's the worst.

2419
01:21:01,144 --> 01:21:03,204
She voted for Jae Seok and Seok Jin.

2420
01:21:03,205 --> 01:21:04,549
Min Si.

2421
01:21:04,774 --> 01:21:07,320
- Did you vote for me? - You're terrible.

2422
01:21:07,385 --> 01:21:10,153
Min Si will also be penalized today.

2423
01:21:10,154 --> 01:21:11,729
Poor Min Si.

2424
01:21:12,215 --> 01:21:14,723
Water will fall in the count of three.

2425
01:21:14,724 --> 01:21:17,500
1, 2, 3.

2426
01:21:18,925 --> 01:21:19,954
(The water bomb is launched.)

2427
01:21:19,955 --> 01:21:21,164
There it is.

2428
01:21:21,165 --> 01:21:23,139
(Splashing)

2429
01:21:24,194 --> 01:21:25,393
Oh, no.

2430
01:21:25,394 --> 01:21:27,303
- Gosh. - Thank you.

2431
01:21:27,304 --> 01:21:28,740
My goodness.

2432
01:21:29,335 --> 01:21:31,950
(Prepared to get back the members' appetite)

2433
01:21:32,035 --> 01:21:34,650
(Running Man's Michelin Guide restaurant)

2434
01:21:34,974 --> 01:21:37,790
(Park Ji Hyun and Hong Hyun Hee also join.)

2435
01:21:37,974 --> 01:21:40,143
(A special way to order at Running Man Michelin restaurant)

2436
01:21:40,144 --> 01:21:41,943
(An order of a stew course meal, please.)

2437
01:21:41,944 --> 01:21:44,113
(One order of Shindang tteokbokki)

2438
01:21:44,114 --> 01:21:46,860
(You serve your own water.)

2439
01:21:47,125 --> 01:21:49,924
(Members fill up their stomach with water.)

2440
01:21:49,925 --> 01:21:51,523
(However)

2441
01:21:51,524 --> 01:21:53,153
(Ruining a fancy meal)

2442
01:21:53,154 --> 01:21:54,824
(Big eaters infiltrated.)

2443
01:21:54,825 --> 01:21:56,299
Why are you sitting next to me?

2444
01:21:56,325 --> 01:21:58,063
(They lose their dignity.)

2445
01:21:58,064 --> 01:22:00,134
(They start to get suspicious.)

2446
01:22:00,135 --> 01:22:02,339
(Running Man gourmets become extremely sensitive.)

2447
01:22:02,965 --> 01:22:04,233
(Ruining fancy meals)

2448
01:22:04,234 --> 01:22:06,103
