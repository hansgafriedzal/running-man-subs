1
00:00:05,685 --> 00:00:06,744
Hello.

2
00:00:06,745 --> 00:00:08,614
- I haven't been here for a while. - Hello.

3
00:00:08,615 --> 00:00:10,084
Did you guys watch "AM Plaza" today?

4
00:00:10,085 --> 00:00:11,160
Yes, I did.

5
00:00:11,785 --> 00:00:13,653
(Yu San Seul, also known as Yu Jae Seok, was on "Am Plaza".)

6
00:00:13,654 --> 00:00:16,053
- San Seul was on the show. - My goodness.

7
00:00:16,054 --> 00:00:17,954
- By the way, Jae Seok... - Yu San Seul.

8
00:00:17,955 --> 00:00:19,364
and Yu San Seul were both trending online.

9
00:00:19,365 --> 00:00:20,723
- They were on the trending list. - Okay.

10
00:00:20,724 --> 00:00:22,064
Hey, Yu San Seul was ranked higher.

11
00:00:22,065 --> 00:00:24,134
You know what? I can't forget what Seok Jin said to me...

12
00:00:24,135 --> 00:00:25,733
- when I got here. - What did he say?

13
00:00:25,734 --> 00:00:27,904
- What did he say? - What?

14
00:00:27,905 --> 00:00:30,374
(What was the first thing he said before the filming?)

15
00:00:30,375 --> 00:00:31,604
"I'm jealous."

16
00:00:31,605 --> 00:00:33,904
(I'm jealous.)

17
00:00:33,905 --> 00:00:35,613
(He's jealous of San Seul's success.)

18
00:00:35,614 --> 00:00:37,614
- Seok Jin is totally jealous. - My gosh.

19
00:00:37,615 --> 00:00:40,383
- I was very jealous. - You're really honest, by the way.

20
00:00:40,384 --> 00:00:42,654
- To be honest, - Seok Jin is jealous...

21
00:00:42,655 --> 00:00:44,684
- of me and So Min. - My gosh.

22
00:00:44,685 --> 00:00:46,184
- Why is he jealous of So Min? - Goodness.

23
00:00:46,185 --> 00:00:49,353
So Min is going viral because of her armpit incident.

24
00:00:49,354 --> 00:00:51,124
("As So Min's Armpits Sweat, the TV Ratings Soar")

25
00:00:51,125 --> 00:00:52,993
- He's very jealous. - So Min...

26
00:00:52,994 --> 00:00:55,593
Seeing Jae Seok establish a new career as San Seul...

27
00:00:55,594 --> 00:00:57,033
- makes me jealous. - Many are jealous of you...

28
00:00:57,034 --> 00:00:58,194
because you live the life of a bachelor.

29
00:00:58,195 --> 00:00:59,233
Many are jealous of you...

30
00:00:59,234 --> 00:01:00,803
(Some people are jealous of Seok Jin...)

31
00:01:00,804 --> 00:01:02,233
(who's in a crisis.)

32
00:01:02,234 --> 00:01:04,074
- Some are jealous of you. - "The life of a bachelor"?

33
00:01:04,075 --> 00:01:05,173
- No. - A lot of dads...

34
00:01:05,174 --> 00:01:06,874
- are jealous of you. - I live the life of a married man.

35
00:01:06,875 --> 00:01:08,504
A lot of people are jealous of you.

36
00:01:08,505 --> 00:01:10,173
- That's funny. He's hiding it. - That's not true.

37
00:01:10,174 --> 00:01:13,214
But his wife lives like she's single too.

38
00:01:13,215 --> 00:01:15,914
(Is his wife in a crisis too?)

39
00:01:15,915 --> 00:01:18,590
She's having fun like a single lady.

40
00:01:18,614 --> 00:01:21,029
- She lives like a single lady. - That's so cool.

41
00:01:21,784 --> 00:01:24,223
- Hey, Ji Hyo is in a new drama. - Right. I read the article.

42
00:01:24,224 --> 00:01:25,354
Yes, I read the article.

43
00:01:25,355 --> 00:01:28,264
- "Did We Really Love?" - Who's your love interest?

44
00:01:28,265 --> 00:01:30,533
- Three men like your character. - That's right.

45
00:01:30,534 --> 00:01:32,533
- There are 4 guys that like me. - There are 4?

46
00:01:32,534 --> 00:01:33,964
We're close with the director.

47
00:01:33,965 --> 00:01:35,604
- Who's the director? - It's Seok Yoon.

48
00:01:35,605 --> 00:01:37,173
- Kim Seok Yoon. - He's the director?

49
00:01:37,174 --> 00:01:40,973
- He's the CP. He's the head. - I ought to give him a call.

50
00:01:40,974 --> 00:01:41,973
(I ought to give him a call.)

51
00:01:41,974 --> 00:01:44,343
- You're trying to do everything. - Hey.

52
00:01:44,344 --> 00:01:45,983
- That doesn't work nowadays. - I can't believe this.

53
00:01:45,984 --> 00:01:47,983
- I was on his show before. - What are you saying?

54
00:01:47,984 --> 00:01:50,283
- I was on one of his shows too. - Really?

55
00:01:50,284 --> 00:01:52,684
He's doing well, directing dramas and movies.

56
00:01:52,685 --> 00:01:54,983
- My gosh, he's the CP? - He can't betray us like this.

57
00:01:54,984 --> 00:01:58,070
- What do you mean? - He did variety shows.

58
00:01:58,295 --> 00:02:00,893
He was the first one who gave me the costume head for a grasshopper.

59
00:02:00,894 --> 00:02:01,994
Really?

60
00:02:01,995 --> 00:02:04,134
- Really? He's your savior. - So in other words,

61
00:02:04,135 --> 00:02:06,639
- when no one hired me for shows, - Right.

62
00:02:06,834 --> 00:02:09,109
- he hired me as the director. - Kim Seok Yoon.

63
00:02:09,334 --> 00:02:11,033
He told me to come to the sixth floor, so I went.

64
00:02:11,034 --> 00:02:13,649
- He put the costume on his desk. - He's your hero.

65
00:02:14,875 --> 00:02:16,543
"If you want to be on variety shows,"

66
00:02:16,544 --> 00:02:17,790
"you must wear this."

67
00:02:20,115 --> 00:02:22,353
(It was the moment that brought a big change to Jae Seok.)

68
00:02:22,354 --> 00:02:24,454
(Jae Seok got a nickname, Grasshopper.)

69
00:02:24,455 --> 00:02:28,399
(A cornerstone that helped him become the nationally beloved host)

70
00:02:28,784 --> 00:02:30,630
"If you want it, put it on. If you don't want it,"

71
00:02:30,655 --> 00:02:32,494
- "you can leave." - Seok Yoon...

72
00:02:32,495 --> 00:02:34,739
When I was active with my song "One Man",

73
00:02:34,824 --> 00:02:36,994
- he told me to be an actor. - My gosh.

74
00:02:36,995 --> 00:02:38,234
And I never heard from him again.

75
00:02:38,235 --> 00:02:40,339
(It's already been 15 years.)

76
00:02:40,705 --> 00:02:42,510
Seok Yoon will give you a call.

77
00:02:43,034 --> 00:02:45,573
Whenever I saw him, he told me to be an actor.

78
00:02:45,574 --> 00:02:47,404
He's one of many people who helped me...

79
00:02:47,405 --> 00:02:49,549
- get where I am now. - That's true.

80
00:02:50,014 --> 00:02:51,950
- He works with Ji Hyo a lot. - He'll work with Ji Hyo.

81
00:02:52,585 --> 00:02:54,060
Is there anything for Seok Jin?

82
00:02:54,985 --> 00:02:56,114
All right. Today,

83
00:02:56,115 --> 00:02:57,959
- There's no news about Seok Jin? - last week...

84
00:02:59,085 --> 00:03:00,783
(There's no news about Seok Jin.)

85
00:03:00,784 --> 00:03:03,353
- Nothing for Seok Jin? - I'm sure you can find something.

86
00:03:03,354 --> 00:03:05,394
- Anything about his bachelor life? - Bachelor life?

87
00:03:05,395 --> 00:03:06,723
Did he go on another trip?

88
00:03:06,724 --> 00:03:09,310
Seok Jin is wearing long johns today.

89
00:03:10,564 --> 00:03:12,440
What about Kwang Soo? Anything for him?

90
00:03:12,534 --> 00:03:13,603
Well,

91
00:03:13,604 --> 00:03:15,204
I've been filming in Incheon lately.

92
00:03:15,205 --> 00:03:16,450
What? For what?

93
00:03:16,534 --> 00:03:20,904
It's been over six months since I started filming "Sinkhole".

94
00:03:20,905 --> 00:03:22,614
- It's a film about a disaster. - You know what?

95
00:03:22,615 --> 00:03:24,290
He's filming with Cha Seung Won.

96
00:03:24,514 --> 00:03:26,084
- You're awful. - Gosh, you know what?

97
00:03:26,085 --> 00:03:27,660
I stop following it after "Tazza: One-Eyed Jacks."

98
00:03:28,044 --> 00:03:30,060
- Hey, there will be another one. - He always talks about that.

99
00:03:30,085 --> 00:03:31,353
- "One-Eyed Jacks." - "One-Eyed Jacks."

100
00:03:31,354 --> 00:03:32,883
- There's another one. - "One-Eyed Jacks."

101
00:03:32,884 --> 00:03:34,329
I thought he was filming that.

102
00:03:34,455 --> 00:03:35,823
Cha In Pyo... No, that's the wrong name.

103
00:03:35,824 --> 00:03:37,494
- Isn't that with Cha Seung Won? - Right.

104
00:03:37,495 --> 00:03:39,424
- You'd better be nice to Seung Won. - Okay.

105
00:03:39,425 --> 00:03:41,299
Seriously. Be nice to him.

106
00:03:42,224 --> 00:03:43,464
- Is that all? - Yes.

107
00:03:43,465 --> 00:03:44,633
That's it.

108
00:03:44,634 --> 00:03:47,533
All right. We'll settle that he'll be nice to Seung Won.

109
00:03:47,534 --> 00:03:49,380
- I'll be nice. - Be nice to him.

110
00:03:49,805 --> 00:03:51,804
We've prepared today's episode to repent...

111
00:03:51,805 --> 00:03:53,404
for doubting and framing one other...

112
00:03:53,405 --> 00:03:54,880
for the past weeks and unite as one.

113
00:03:55,175 --> 00:03:56,619
- Unite as one? - Unite?

114
00:03:56,715 --> 00:03:58,913
It's Everyone Must Pass: Along with Distrust Race.

115
00:03:58,914 --> 00:04:00,343
(Everyone Must Pass: Along with Distrust Race.)

116
00:04:00,344 --> 00:04:02,630
- We're good at that. - We need to come together.

117
00:04:02,685 --> 00:04:04,084
We're good at uniting as one.

118
00:04:04,085 --> 00:04:06,399
You will try out for four missions where everyone must pass.

119
00:04:06,425 --> 00:04:08,124
Whenever you successfully complete each mission,

120
00:04:08,125 --> 00:04:10,700
you'll be provided with delicious winter snacks.

121
00:04:11,094 --> 00:04:12,593
- Fish-shaped bun. - Fish-shaped bun, hotteok,

122
00:04:12,594 --> 00:04:13,823
- fishcake. - Fishcake.

123
00:04:13,824 --> 00:04:15,424
- I'm craving ramyeon... - Egg bun.

124
00:04:15,425 --> 00:04:17,964
- or snacks more than fancy meals. - They are more delicious.

125
00:04:17,965 --> 00:04:20,440
We have prepared unique winter snacks today.

126
00:04:20,465 --> 00:04:23,833
If you fail, one more member will have to face the penalty.

127
00:04:23,834 --> 00:04:24,903
One more member?

128
00:04:24,904 --> 00:04:26,674
Members who have to carry out the penalty...

129
00:04:26,675 --> 00:04:30,250
will do the Yondu makeup and sell 100 fish-shaped buns.

130
00:04:30,675 --> 00:04:32,344
(With this makeup on,)

131
00:04:32,345 --> 00:04:34,313
(we must sell 100 fish-shaped buns?)

132
00:04:34,314 --> 00:04:36,760
- We have to wear makeup? - Sell 100 with the makeup on?

133
00:04:37,055 --> 00:04:38,383
- I really don't want to do that. - My gosh.

134
00:04:38,384 --> 00:04:40,724
- We can't let our guard down. - I really don't want to do that.

135
00:04:40,725 --> 00:04:44,200
We will give you each 10 candies.

136
00:04:44,295 --> 00:04:46,864
The number of remaining candies will determine who'll face the penalty.

137
00:04:46,865 --> 00:04:49,063
The member with the most candies will win the race.

138
00:04:49,064 --> 00:04:52,039
The winning member will win a prize and be exempted from the penalty.

139
00:04:52,064 --> 00:04:53,333
- We can get chosen for the penalty. - Yes.

140
00:04:53,334 --> 00:04:56,133
The members with the least candies will face out the penalty.

141
00:04:56,134 --> 00:04:57,234
For example,

142
00:04:57,235 --> 00:04:59,874
if you fail 3 missions as a team, 3 of you will face the penalty.

143
00:04:59,875 --> 00:05:02,273
Two members with the least candies will face the penalty.

144
00:05:02,274 --> 00:05:04,313
And as for the last member to face the penalty,

145
00:05:04,314 --> 00:05:06,484
the 2 members will discuss and select 1 more member.

146
00:05:06,485 --> 00:05:08,643
Is there a scenario where we won't face the penalty?

147
00:05:08,644 --> 00:05:10,383
If you complete all of the missions, you won't have to.

148
00:05:10,384 --> 00:05:11,829
- Right. We can complete them. - All of them?

149
00:05:11,855 --> 00:05:13,784
- We should complete the missions. - We really have to.

150
00:05:13,785 --> 00:05:15,153
- You'd better bring your A-game. - Okay.

151
00:05:15,154 --> 00:05:17,193
- Shall we start? - I'll give you the candy pouch.

152
00:05:17,194 --> 00:05:19,523
- Everyone should pass. - All of us will pass.

153
00:05:19,524 --> 00:05:21,624
- No one should face the penalty. - Let's do our best.

154
00:05:21,625 --> 00:05:23,294
- We must complete all the missions. - Right.

155
00:05:23,295 --> 00:05:24,734
We must complete all four missions.

156
00:05:24,735 --> 00:05:27,034
- But that will be hard. - My gosh.

157
00:05:27,035 --> 00:05:28,810
Don't steal candies to win the race, Kwang Soo.

158
00:05:28,964 --> 00:05:30,073
I won't do that.

159
00:05:30,074 --> 00:05:33,180
- To get exempted from... - Why are you eating that?

160
00:05:33,444 --> 00:05:35,779
Why are you eating that?

161
00:05:36,115 --> 00:05:37,974
- What do you mean? - That's our money.

162
00:05:37,975 --> 00:05:39,044
That means you lost one.

163
00:05:39,045 --> 00:05:40,414
- They'll give me one more. - We don't have any left.

164
00:05:40,415 --> 00:05:42,914
(We don't have any left.)

165
00:05:42,915 --> 00:05:44,184
Stop lying. Give me one.

166
00:05:44,185 --> 00:05:46,153
- You can't eat that. - Are you serious?

167
00:05:46,154 --> 00:05:47,653
All right. He lost one. That's it.

168
00:05:47,654 --> 00:05:48,753
Seok Jin only has nine to start with.

169
00:05:48,754 --> 00:05:50,200
He will face the penalty for sure.

170
00:05:50,355 --> 00:05:52,664
- Can I spit it out? - No.

171
00:05:52,665 --> 00:05:55,794
- I can put it back nicely. - It's over. That's it.

172
00:05:55,795 --> 00:05:57,534
I can see your future in about six hours.

173
00:05:57,535 --> 00:05:59,304
- I know for sure who it will be. - Mr. Yondu.

174
00:05:59,305 --> 00:06:02,164
(Be Yondu, Seok Jin)

175
00:06:02,165 --> 00:06:03,450
I won't be Yondu.

176
00:06:03,675 --> 00:06:06,250
We'll get going for your first mission.

177
00:06:06,444 --> 00:06:07,849
Am I really starting with nine candies?

178
00:06:08,105 --> 00:06:09,450
Of course.

179
00:06:10,074 --> 00:06:12,089
- What's this now? - What is it?

180
00:06:12,545 --> 00:06:14,443
I'm really good at this kind of game.

181
00:06:14,444 --> 00:06:15,930
(What kind of mission awaits the members?)

182
00:06:16,615 --> 00:06:19,354
(There are partitions, a scoreboard, and soccer balls.)

183
00:06:19,355 --> 00:06:20,959
(What is their first mission?)

184
00:06:21,125 --> 00:06:22,224
It's the fish-shaped bun which I love.

185
00:06:22,225 --> 00:06:23,500
What's that huge fish-shaped bun?

186
00:06:24,595 --> 00:06:25,624
(It impresses them right away.)

187
00:06:25,625 --> 00:06:26,893
That's the fish-shaped bun?

188
00:06:26,894 --> 00:06:29,099
The first winter snack...

189
00:06:29,134 --> 00:06:31,693
- is a huge fish-shaped bun. - That's the fish-shaped bun.

190
00:06:31,694 --> 00:06:33,833
- This is amazing. - Some parts taste like pizza.

191
00:06:33,834 --> 00:06:34,909
Pizza?

192
00:06:35,665 --> 00:06:37,409
This is crazy.

193
00:06:37,535 --> 00:06:38,903
- The huge fish-shaped bun... - I want pizza.

194
00:06:38,904 --> 00:06:40,050
is at stake on the first mission.

195
00:06:40,074 --> 00:06:42,143
Everyone Must Get the Right Answer: Striker the King of Quiz.

196
00:06:42,144 --> 00:06:43,174
- It's a quiz. - A quiz?

197
00:06:43,175 --> 00:06:44,849
- We're doomed. - Come on.

198
00:06:45,314 --> 00:06:47,544
You'll kick a ball to the scoreboard that consists of...

199
00:06:47,545 --> 00:06:49,153
different categories ranging from 10 to 40 points.

200
00:06:49,154 --> 00:06:51,653
You'll solve a question from the category your ball lands.

201
00:06:51,654 --> 00:06:54,354
Everyone will get to kick once. So within a total of eight attempts,

202
00:06:54,355 --> 00:06:56,624
if you gather 100 points, you have completed your mission.

203
00:06:56,625 --> 00:06:57,700
We need 100 points?

204
00:06:57,795 --> 00:07:00,364
If we complete four missions, you can't change your words.

205
00:07:00,365 --> 00:07:03,763
If we complete all four missions, you should do the Yondu makeup.

206
00:07:03,764 --> 00:07:06,104
Come on. They can't do that.

207
00:07:06,105 --> 00:07:07,434
- You should do it. - They can't do that.

208
00:07:07,435 --> 00:07:08,463
You can...

209
00:07:08,464 --> 00:07:10,734
They are already working hard trying to edit our videos.

210
00:07:10,735 --> 00:07:12,349
- Jae Seok is scolding him. - Hey.

211
00:07:12,675 --> 00:07:14,244
- He's getting scolded verbally. - Whose side are you on?

212
00:07:14,245 --> 00:07:16,044
- He's getting scolded verbally. - Whose side are you on?

213
00:07:16,045 --> 00:07:18,273
- I feel bad for our staff. - They must bet something for us...

214
00:07:18,274 --> 00:07:19,784
- to feel motivated. - They stayed up all night...

215
00:07:19,785 --> 00:07:21,114
and now, they have to do the makeup?

216
00:07:21,115 --> 00:07:23,554
- They ought to do that. - We don't do that in this era.

217
00:07:23,555 --> 00:07:25,029
Let's bet something.

218
00:07:25,254 --> 00:07:26,383
- Okay? - Seok Jin.

219
00:07:26,384 --> 00:07:27,760
Se Chan,

220
00:07:27,954 --> 00:07:29,624
- What? - Ji Hyo, and I have to solve them.

221
00:07:29,625 --> 00:07:31,124
- My gosh. - You need to be understanding.

222
00:07:31,125 --> 00:07:33,224
But the worst one among them is Ji Hyo.

223
00:07:33,225 --> 00:07:35,164
(But the worst one among them is Ji Hyo.)

224
00:07:35,165 --> 00:07:36,193
- If I'm being really honest. - That's true.

225
00:07:36,194 --> 00:07:37,794
- She's not faking it at all. - She's the hidden player.

226
00:07:37,795 --> 00:07:41,180
But we weren't able to air the quiz clips for Ji Hyo.

227
00:07:42,035 --> 00:07:43,349
(That's true.)

228
00:07:43,735 --> 00:07:44,909
Sister Fish.

229
00:07:45,634 --> 00:07:46,874
He called you Sister Fish.

230
00:07:46,875 --> 00:07:48,943
- I like fish - You are Sister Fish, aren't you?

231
00:07:48,944 --> 00:07:50,544
- I'm not your sister. - Ms. Fish.

232
00:07:50,545 --> 00:07:52,589
- Sister Fish and Madame Gurie. - I think...

233
00:07:52,745 --> 00:07:54,344
Clueless Ji Hyo is better.

234
00:07:54,345 --> 00:07:56,190
- That's nice. It's cute. - Clueless Ji Hyo.

235
00:07:56,685 --> 00:07:58,813
- How witty. That was so witty. - You're indeed better than us.

236
00:07:58,814 --> 00:08:00,083
You can say Clueless Ji Hyo.

237
00:08:00,084 --> 00:08:01,284
How about...

238
00:08:01,285 --> 00:08:03,269
Informative Ji Hyo.

239
00:08:03,524 --> 00:08:05,424
(What is that?)

240
00:08:05,425 --> 00:08:07,124
Informative Ji Hyo?

241
00:08:07,125 --> 00:08:08,594
- Seok Jin fails! - Fails!

242
00:08:08,595 --> 00:08:10,339
(Seok Jin fails!)

243
00:08:10,495 --> 00:08:12,494
(It's so fun teasing Seok Jin.)

244
00:08:12,495 --> 00:08:13,763
(The guys are having fun.)

245
00:08:13,764 --> 00:08:16,374
Strangely, I'm so happy when you tease me like this.

246
00:08:16,375 --> 00:08:18,779
(Clasping his hands tightly)

247
00:08:18,834 --> 00:08:20,149
Keep talking about me.

248
00:08:20,745 --> 00:08:21,804
I liked it when you said I failed.

249
00:08:21,805 --> 00:08:23,389
You're getting attention from us.

250
00:08:23,475 --> 00:08:25,273
- I guess I'm an attention-seeker. - You can get started now.

251
00:08:25,274 --> 00:08:27,420
Of course, you cannot discuss when solving the quizzes.

252
00:08:28,314 --> 00:08:29,430
Well, that won't help anyway.

253
00:08:29,785 --> 00:08:31,453
- I don't want English words. - Hold on.

254
00:08:31,454 --> 00:08:34,224
Are you saying that you can get everything right except for English?

255
00:08:34,225 --> 00:08:35,453
I want People.

256
00:08:35,454 --> 00:08:37,054
I can solve quizzes about People and Music.

257
00:08:37,055 --> 00:08:38,224
You can tell us...

258
00:08:38,225 --> 00:08:39,364
- before you start. - We'll start.

259
00:08:39,365 --> 00:08:41,023
All of you must kick it at least once.

260
00:08:41,024 --> 00:08:42,523
- Really? - You have eight chances.

261
00:08:42,524 --> 00:08:43,633
- I'll go first. - Really?

262
00:08:43,634 --> 00:08:44,893
Seok Jin will go first.

263
00:08:44,894 --> 00:08:46,140
- I'll start! - Start.

264
00:08:48,764 --> 00:08:50,673
(On which category...)

265
00:08:50,674 --> 00:08:53,780
(and how many points will Seok Jin's ball land?)

266
00:08:55,644 --> 00:08:57,520
- That's 20 points, right? - English Words.

267
00:08:58,475 --> 00:09:00,890
English Words for 20 points. Please sit.

268
00:09:01,585 --> 00:09:03,354
We're in trouble. How will we solve this one?

269
00:09:03,355 --> 00:09:05,013
I'm doomed. I don't know anything.

270
00:09:05,014 --> 00:09:06,683
- I'll just write down what I know. - All right.

271
00:09:06,684 --> 00:09:07,724
(Their 1st question is on English Words for 20 points.)

272
00:09:07,725 --> 00:09:09,099
Here's your question.

273
00:09:09,125 --> 00:09:11,869
This question about English Words will earn you 20 points.

274
00:09:11,894 --> 00:09:13,040
We'll get 20 points.

275
00:09:13,495 --> 00:09:15,724
- It won't be that hard. - It's not that hard.

276
00:09:15,725 --> 00:09:18,709
If you all write down the correct answer, you'll get the points.

277
00:09:19,034 --> 00:09:20,239
Write down...

278
00:09:21,235 --> 00:09:22,364
all the colors...

279
00:09:22,365 --> 00:09:25,173
you would get when you mix red and blue together...

280
00:09:25,174 --> 00:09:26,550
in English.

281
00:09:26,705 --> 00:09:28,043
- How would we do know that? - I don't know that.

282
00:09:28,044 --> 00:09:29,589
I'm color blind.

283
00:09:29,674 --> 00:09:32,543
What do we get when we mix red and blue? Do we get black?

284
00:09:32,544 --> 00:09:34,820
I know the color, but I don't know that in English.

285
00:09:34,845 --> 00:09:36,530
- What's the color? - Can I tell you?

286
00:09:36,754 --> 00:09:38,259
- It's purple. - Is it purple?

287
00:09:38,414 --> 00:09:40,259
No, it's green.

288
00:09:40,284 --> 00:09:41,454
It's green?

289
00:09:41,455 --> 00:09:42,900
Isn't it purple? It's green?

290
00:09:42,995 --> 00:09:44,824
No, it's purple.

291
00:09:44,825 --> 00:09:46,800
I'm in trouble. I can't even spell blue.

292
00:09:46,894 --> 00:09:48,339
Hold on. Blue...

293
00:09:48,664 --> 00:09:49,763
Blue is blue.

294
00:09:49,764 --> 00:09:52,263
I can't... I can't spell red in English. This is awful.

295
00:09:52,264 --> 00:09:53,803
- Hey, come on. - Wait, the letter in the middle...

296
00:09:53,804 --> 00:09:54,933
Are you serious?

297
00:09:54,934 --> 00:09:56,003
Wait, this is...

298
00:09:56,004 --> 00:09:57,234
(Why did he write down R, D, and B on the board?)

299
00:09:57,235 --> 00:09:59,079
My gosh, I'm confused about the words.

300
00:09:59,375 --> 00:10:01,520
The last word has five letters, right?

301
00:10:01,705 --> 00:10:03,474
- There are six. - What? Why?

302
00:10:03,475 --> 00:10:04,513
(He's shocked.)

303
00:10:04,514 --> 00:10:05,849
(There are 6 letters?)

304
00:10:06,184 --> 00:10:07,560
There are six.

305
00:10:07,884 --> 00:10:09,589
Wait. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.

306
00:10:09,855 --> 00:10:11,753
- That's not right. - There are six letters.

307
00:10:11,754 --> 00:10:13,759
- That can't be. Hold on. - There are six letters.

308
00:10:13,955 --> 00:10:16,423
- There are six letters? - Purple.

309
00:10:16,424 --> 00:10:18,753
We'll let you discuss up to here.

310
00:10:18,754 --> 00:10:21,040
- This can't be right. Wait. - Purple.

311
00:10:21,065 --> 00:10:22,224
- It's purple? - Yes.

312
00:10:22,225 --> 00:10:23,469
You know that in English, right?

313
00:10:23,835 --> 00:10:25,339
Can't we go with green?

314
00:10:25,995 --> 00:10:27,379
Let's go with green.

315
00:10:28,065 --> 00:10:30,173
There are three colors. One.

316
00:10:30,174 --> 00:10:31,374
- Let's get this one right. - Two.

317
00:10:31,375 --> 00:10:33,543
You can't cheat. 1, 2.

318
00:10:33,544 --> 00:10:34,604
Wait.

319
00:10:34,605 --> 00:10:36,944
- Three. Show me your boards. - I'm not sure.

320
00:10:36,945 --> 00:10:38,273
(Did everyone get it right?)

321
00:10:38,274 --> 00:10:39,783
(The answer is red, blue, and purple.)

322
00:10:39,784 --> 00:10:41,413
- This has to be correct. - I think my answer is right.

323
00:10:41,414 --> 00:10:43,114
- I think this is right. - A long time ago,

324
00:10:43,115 --> 00:10:44,430
I wrote that on the card.

325
00:10:44,615 --> 00:10:46,129
I guess we all have the right answers.

326
00:10:46,325 --> 00:10:47,499
Did everyone get it right?

327
00:10:48,054 --> 00:10:49,253
(Haha gets it right.)

328
00:10:49,254 --> 00:10:50,393
Did everyone get it right?

329
00:10:50,394 --> 00:10:52,170
(Jae Seok also gets it right.)

330
00:10:52,924 --> 00:10:54,523
- I guess so. Look at his face. - We all get it right.

331
00:10:54,524 --> 00:10:56,133
(Did Se Chan and Ji Hyo get the question right?)

332
00:10:56,134 --> 00:10:57,369
We all got it right.

333
00:10:57,465 --> 00:10:58,640
They look nervous.

334
00:11:00,865 --> 00:11:03,079
- I don't know. - What? What did you write down?

335
00:11:03,105 --> 00:11:04,173
Why are you laughing?

336
00:11:04,174 --> 00:11:05,849
Hey, everyone is laughing at Se Chan.

337
00:11:05,875 --> 00:11:07,280
Why are you laughing at Se Chan?

338
00:11:07,345 --> 00:11:09,273
- That means Se Chan got it wrong. - Which one got it wrong?

339
00:11:09,274 --> 00:11:10,844
All right.

340
00:11:10,845 --> 00:11:12,844
Red is spelled R-E-D.

341
00:11:12,845 --> 00:11:14,143
- I got it right. - Okay.

342
00:11:14,144 --> 00:11:16,430
- Blue is spelled B-L-U-E. - Yes.

343
00:11:16,514 --> 00:11:17,660
Darn it.

344
00:11:18,384 --> 00:11:20,160
Who just said, "darn it"?

345
00:11:20,884 --> 00:11:22,923
Purple is spelled P-U-R-P-L-E.

346
00:11:22,924 --> 00:11:25,030
- Yes! I got it right. - Okay!

347
00:11:25,095 --> 00:11:27,124
Purple is spelled P-U-R-P-L-E.

348
00:11:27,125 --> 00:11:28,393
(He's happy that he got the last one right.)

349
00:11:28,394 --> 00:11:29,509
I spelled "purple" correctly!

350
00:11:30,264 --> 00:11:32,879
(Since 4 of them got the question wrong, they fail the 1st round.)

351
00:11:33,565 --> 00:11:34,979
You got them all right.

352
00:11:35,004 --> 00:11:36,633
- I got them right! - What did you write down?

353
00:11:36,634 --> 00:11:37,933
- I got them right too. - My answer was correct!

354
00:11:37,934 --> 00:11:39,680
- Seok Jin. - I misspelled it.

355
00:11:40,144 --> 00:11:41,643
You said there were six letters, Seok Jin.

356
00:11:41,644 --> 00:11:42,920
How could you get it wrong?

357
00:11:43,274 --> 00:11:45,574
I made a mistake. Why did I mess this up?

358
00:11:45,575 --> 00:11:46,814
- What did you write? Let me see. - I'm sorry.

359
00:11:46,815 --> 00:11:47,984
- I was in a hurry. - Let me see.

360
00:11:47,985 --> 00:11:50,553
What is "bulru"?

361
00:11:50,554 --> 00:11:52,714
- He really didn't know. - "Bulru".

362
00:11:52,715 --> 00:11:54,683
Hey, "bulru..."

363
00:11:54,684 --> 00:11:55,854
I got "purple" wrong.

364
00:11:55,855 --> 00:11:57,070
Hey, aren't I smart?

365
00:11:57,154 --> 00:11:59,194
- Let's compliment each other. - I got it right as well.

366
00:11:59,195 --> 00:12:02,523
We shouldn't pick any that are related to English.

367
00:12:02,524 --> 00:12:04,533
We should pick anything but that.

368
00:12:04,534 --> 00:12:06,509
You've failed the first round.

369
00:12:07,664 --> 00:12:09,133
It was worth 20 points.

370
00:12:09,134 --> 00:12:11,433
- Gosh. - I can't believe I got it right.

371
00:12:11,434 --> 00:12:12,503
(Will they be able to accumulate 100 points in 7 tries?)

372
00:12:12,504 --> 00:12:13,503
Then...

373
00:12:13,504 --> 00:12:14,543
(Tell them that I got this right.)

374
00:12:14,544 --> 00:12:16,574
- Hey, I get it, so go. - Compliment me.

375
00:12:16,575 --> 00:12:17,773
Don't gloat over this.

376
00:12:17,774 --> 00:12:19,214
- P-U-R-P-L-E. - Did you get it?

377
00:12:19,215 --> 00:12:20,660
- I did. - Goodness.

378
00:12:20,684 --> 00:12:21,920
Dream!

379
00:12:22,745 --> 00:12:24,329
Your dad isn't stupid!

380
00:12:24,455 --> 00:12:25,783
(Jealous)

381
00:12:25,784 --> 00:12:27,530
I can speak English!

382
00:12:28,884 --> 00:12:30,194
(Dream, are you watching?)

383
00:12:30,195 --> 00:12:31,694
Dream, I got it right!

384
00:12:31,695 --> 00:12:34,300
- How awesome. - You're awesome.

385
00:12:34,664 --> 00:12:37,433
The category is Music, and it's worth 30 points.

386
00:12:37,434 --> 00:12:38,663
Okay, let's get this one right.

387
00:12:38,664 --> 00:12:41,410
You're going to hear a familiar song.

388
00:12:41,504 --> 00:12:43,509
Listen carefully to the lyrics...

389
00:12:43,674 --> 00:12:46,173
and write the answer to the given question.

390
00:12:46,174 --> 00:12:47,173
- Okay. - I like this.

391
00:12:47,174 --> 00:12:48,604
Isn't this so fun?

392
00:12:48,605 --> 00:12:50,273
It sure is. We should've picked this one.

393
00:12:50,274 --> 00:12:55,089
Here's the music. Please play.

394
00:12:56,455 --> 00:12:57,513
What is this?

395
00:12:57,514 --> 00:12:58,683
(Which song is this?)

396
00:12:58,684 --> 00:13:00,300
Isn't this Outsider?

397
00:13:00,455 --> 00:13:02,053
What? You're right.

398
00:13:02,054 --> 00:13:04,170
(Something feels ominous.)

399
00:13:06,024 --> 00:13:08,263
- Is it related to English? - Be quiet!

400
00:13:08,264 --> 00:13:09,400
(Haha suspects the staff.)

401
00:13:10,894 --> 00:13:13,079
(So Min jots down the lyrics.)

402
00:13:14,534 --> 00:13:16,979
(Everyone is focused.)

403
00:13:18,075 --> 00:13:19,173
(What...)

404
00:13:19,174 --> 00:13:21,719
(is he saying?)

405
00:13:21,820 --> 00:13:26,220
<font color="#fcc89b">[VIU Ver] SBS E479 Running Man</font>

<font color="#ff5fa2">-♥ Ruo Xi ♥-</font>

406
00:13:26,315 --> 00:13:29,020
(Jae Seok looks dazed.)

407
00:13:34,054 --> 00:13:35,800
(The song ends.)

408
00:13:36,495 --> 00:13:38,094
Why does he rap so fast?

409
00:13:38,095 --> 00:13:40,263
- He's amazing. - He sure is.

410
00:13:40,264 --> 00:13:41,864
Here's your question.

411
00:13:41,865 --> 00:13:45,369
What does the protagonist dream about?

412
00:13:45,495 --> 00:13:47,640
- He mentioned that? - It was in the beginning.

413
00:13:48,404 --> 00:13:50,680
I only heard about him wiping something.

414
00:13:50,705 --> 00:13:52,204
This is too hard.

415
00:13:52,205 --> 00:13:54,244
This song is... Gosh, it can't be helped.

416
00:13:54,245 --> 00:13:56,043
We'll have to dress up as Yondu.

417
00:13:56,044 --> 00:13:57,890
His delivery is awful.

418
00:13:58,815 --> 00:14:00,344
(All of them are lost.)

419
00:14:00,345 --> 00:14:01,944
I'll play it once again.

420
00:14:01,945 --> 00:14:03,753
- What was the question again? - Hey.

421
00:14:03,754 --> 00:14:05,253
Did you hear him?

422
00:14:05,254 --> 00:14:07,653
"What was the question again?"

423
00:14:07,654 --> 00:14:09,023
- What was it? - His dream.

424
00:14:09,024 --> 00:14:10,324
- The protagonist's dream? - The protagonist's dream.

425
00:14:10,325 --> 00:14:11,923
- Let's go. - Be quiet and focus.

426
00:14:11,924 --> 00:14:13,423
- Be quiet. - This is your last chance.

427
00:14:13,424 --> 00:14:16,270
All right. Play the music.

428
00:14:26,375 --> 00:14:27,879
(He does his best to listen.)

429
00:14:30,414 --> 00:14:34,214
(They focus all their attention on the lyrics.)

430
00:14:34,215 --> 00:14:36,089
(Concentrating)

431
00:14:37,315 --> 00:14:43,700
(What did the protagonist dream of every night?)

432
00:14:46,465 --> 00:14:48,393
(They focus on the lyrics.)

433
00:14:48,394 --> 00:14:49,933
- When did he mention that? - When did it come out?

434
00:14:49,934 --> 00:14:51,094
It was in the beginning.

435
00:14:51,095 --> 00:14:52,694
I have no idea.

436
00:14:52,695 --> 00:14:54,239
Is this dream...

437
00:14:54,904 --> 00:14:57,303
- like his hope? - Be quiet.

438
00:14:57,304 --> 00:14:59,133
- We don't have time to chat. - Stop irritating me.

439
00:14:59,134 --> 00:15:01,604
By dream, do you mean what he hopes for?

440
00:15:01,605 --> 00:15:02,773
Or is it literal?

441
00:15:02,774 --> 00:15:05,614
He talked about what he dreamed about every night.

442
00:15:05,615 --> 00:15:07,459
I'm so lost.

443
00:15:08,544 --> 00:15:10,783
We just need to write one word, right?

444
00:15:10,784 --> 00:15:11,890
(They jot down their answers.)

445
00:15:11,985 --> 00:15:15,454
As an individual who has experience in rapping...

446
00:15:15,455 --> 00:15:16,969
You sang a trot.

447
00:15:17,355 --> 00:15:18,923
You were a trot singer.

448
00:15:18,924 --> 00:15:20,694
- It has nothing to do with you. - Hey!

449
00:15:20,695 --> 00:15:23,763
I know I'm singing trot these days, but I used to rap back then.

450
00:15:23,764 --> 00:15:25,869
Gosh, he's so successful.

451
00:15:26,565 --> 00:15:27,604
(What's wrong with him?)

452
00:15:27,605 --> 00:15:29,564
Come on. You're a good singer.

453
00:15:29,565 --> 00:15:31,374
- Right. - You suit trot music.

454
00:15:31,375 --> 00:15:33,349
Right? Should I begin my new career?

455
00:15:33,375 --> 00:15:34,744
Yes, you should.

456
00:15:34,745 --> 00:15:36,320
Your stage name should be Mr. Boring.

457
00:15:36,975 --> 00:15:38,114
(Mr. Boring is the upcoming trot singer.)

458
00:15:38,115 --> 00:15:39,190
All right. Three...

459
00:15:39,514 --> 00:15:41,013
I have no idea.

460
00:15:41,014 --> 00:15:43,084
2, 1. Let's see your answers.

461
00:15:43,085 --> 00:15:45,183
- We can't win this one. - I couldn't get anything.

462
00:15:45,184 --> 00:15:46,984
It's impossible for us to all get it right.

463
00:15:46,985 --> 00:15:49,060
How can we all get it right?

464
00:15:49,225 --> 00:15:50,854
What if we all get one word right?

465
00:15:50,855 --> 00:15:52,454
Let's look at your answers one by one.

466
00:15:52,455 --> 00:15:54,724
- Let's do that. - Let's start with Se Chan.

467
00:15:54,725 --> 00:15:56,564
I heard "I picture myself having ramyeon with you."

468
00:15:56,565 --> 00:15:57,594
- What? - This is what I heard.

469
00:15:57,595 --> 00:15:59,209
- He said that? - He did?

470
00:15:59,764 --> 00:16:01,334
(He mimics.)

471
00:16:01,335 --> 00:16:02,334
Really?

472
00:16:02,335 --> 00:16:04,374
I picture myself having ramyeon with you

473
00:16:04,375 --> 00:16:06,109
- Really? - That's what I heard.

474
00:16:06,205 --> 00:16:07,374
What about you, Ji Hyo?

475
00:16:07,375 --> 00:16:08,803
Did you write down all the lyrics?

476
00:16:08,804 --> 00:16:10,114
No. Mine is...

477
00:16:10,115 --> 00:16:12,173
"Every night when he's asleep, a woman comes..."

478
00:16:12,174 --> 00:16:14,314
"and wipes away his tears."

479
00:16:14,315 --> 00:16:16,043
- "There are arrows, he prays..." - "There are arrows, he prays..."

480
00:16:16,044 --> 00:16:17,714
"and is heartbroken. So what?"

481
00:16:17,715 --> 00:16:20,859
So what dream did he have?

482
00:16:20,924 --> 00:16:22,499
Maybe that's her dream.

483
00:16:22,825 --> 00:16:24,923
This is what the woman did in his dreams.

484
00:16:24,924 --> 00:16:26,763
- She did that? - Yes, she did.

485
00:16:26,764 --> 00:16:27,793
You actually heard it.

486
00:16:27,794 --> 00:16:29,464
I wrote, "They meet again."

487
00:16:29,465 --> 00:16:30,864
What is that?

488
00:16:30,865 --> 00:16:32,133
That's all you wrote?

489
00:16:32,134 --> 00:16:34,109
They'll meet again.

490
00:16:34,205 --> 00:16:35,663
I wrote that he wants her to return.

491
00:16:35,664 --> 00:16:37,303
- That's it. He wishes for that. - That's right.

492
00:16:37,304 --> 00:16:39,204
- They're going to meet again. - Yes.

493
00:16:39,205 --> 00:16:40,320
Haha?

494
00:16:40,375 --> 00:16:42,650
I wiped your tears as you cried after getting hit by the arrow

495
00:16:43,004 --> 00:16:45,413
(I wiped your tears as you cried after getting hit by the arrow)

496
00:16:45,414 --> 00:16:46,913
- Why do you sound so cheeky? - I wiped your tears as you cried

497
00:16:46,914 --> 00:16:48,520
After getting hit by the arrow

498
00:16:48,615 --> 00:16:50,190
Hold on. What about you?

499
00:16:51,014 --> 00:16:55,224
I dreamt of her wiping away my tears

500
00:16:55,225 --> 00:16:57,553
But she was hit with an arrow

501
00:16:57,554 --> 00:16:58,930
- That's... - So Min?

502
00:16:59,095 --> 00:17:00,293
- Did you write a poem? - "The woman..."

503
00:17:00,294 --> 00:17:01,923
- Did she get hit by an arrow? - "The woman whom he loved..."

504
00:17:01,924 --> 00:17:03,433
"appeared in his dreams, and he watched her leave."

505
00:17:03,434 --> 00:17:05,994
"She cried, and he tried to wipe the tears, but she refused."

506
00:17:05,995 --> 00:17:07,709
It's similar to Ji Hyo's.

507
00:17:08,335 --> 00:17:09,973
The answer is in there.

508
00:17:09,974 --> 00:17:11,104
- Really? - Really?

509
00:17:11,105 --> 00:17:12,804
(They can't believe it.)

510
00:17:12,805 --> 00:17:13,844
The answer is...

511
00:17:13,845 --> 00:17:15,774
(Which one of them...)

512
00:17:15,775 --> 00:17:17,274
(understood the lyrics?)

513
00:17:17,275 --> 00:17:19,143
- Kwang Soo has the right answer. - Okay!

514
00:17:19,144 --> 00:17:21,114
(Kwang Soo gets it right.)

515
00:17:21,115 --> 00:17:22,314
- What? Let me see? - Really?

516
00:17:22,315 --> 00:17:24,259
- I wrote that but erased it. - I'm not stupid!

517
00:17:24,315 --> 00:17:25,554
What is it?

518
00:17:25,555 --> 00:17:27,059
He dreamt of her wiping away his tears.

519
00:17:27,085 --> 00:17:29,183
I dreamt of her wiping away my tears

520
00:17:29,184 --> 00:17:32,400
(Let's see the footage.)

521
00:17:33,295 --> 00:17:37,933
(I dream of your wiping away my tears in my dreams)

522
00:17:37,934 --> 00:17:39,663
- Then I got it right as well. - Look.

523
00:17:39,664 --> 00:17:41,264
But you wrote about an arrow.

524
00:17:41,265 --> 00:17:43,203
That was just for fun.

525
00:17:43,204 --> 00:17:44,374
All right, you got it right then.

526
00:17:44,375 --> 00:17:45,433
Okay!

527
00:17:45,434 --> 00:17:47,450
Raise your board! Kwang Soo isn't stupid...

528
00:17:47,474 --> 00:17:49,150
and neither am I, Dream.

529
00:17:49,204 --> 00:17:51,074
(He happily repeats his answer.)

530
00:17:51,075 --> 00:17:53,120
(He happily repeats his answer as well.)

531
00:17:53,714 --> 00:17:55,390
(They are incorrigible.)

532
00:17:55,515 --> 00:17:56,983
Where are you?

533
00:17:56,984 --> 00:17:57,983
(He suddenly starts singing.)

534
00:17:57,984 --> 00:17:59,383
What was that?

535
00:17:59,384 --> 00:18:00,754
Were you singing a folk song?

536
00:18:00,755 --> 00:18:02,554
- Was that a folk song? - It was Outsider's song.

537
00:18:02,555 --> 00:18:03,594
- Come on. - Are you sure?

538
00:18:03,595 --> 00:18:05,729
(Since he's a trot singer,)

539
00:18:06,325 --> 00:18:07,893
(he reinterprets the song in his style.)

540
00:18:07,894 --> 00:18:09,239
My gosh.

541
00:18:09,964 --> 00:18:11,670
- This is difficult. - It is.

542
00:18:11,765 --> 00:18:12,963
It's too hard.

543
00:18:12,964 --> 00:18:15,564
All right. Ji Hyo, you can kick this time.

544
00:18:15,565 --> 00:18:17,133
- Yes, you do it. - Pick People.

545
00:18:17,134 --> 00:18:18,834
She's surprisingly good at things like this.

546
00:18:18,835 --> 00:18:20,143
- Start. - Go.

547
00:18:20,144 --> 00:18:21,680
- People. - Don't pick English Words.

548
00:18:24,075 --> 00:18:25,350
- No. - That's 20 points.

549
00:18:25,815 --> 00:18:27,584
(What?)

550
00:18:27,585 --> 00:18:28,743
That's 20 points.

551
00:18:28,744 --> 00:18:30,614
- It's 20 points. - Right? See?

552
00:18:30,615 --> 00:18:32,913
- That's it. - She got People for 20 points.

553
00:18:32,914 --> 00:18:35,084
(Surprisingly,)

554
00:18:35,085 --> 00:18:36,923
(she scored a bullseye.)

555
00:18:36,924 --> 00:18:38,393
- It's 20 points. - People for 20 points.

556
00:18:38,394 --> 00:18:39,769
- Right. - Okay.

557
00:18:39,894 --> 00:18:41,064
It's obviously 20 points.

558
00:18:41,065 --> 00:18:42,893
If we don't get it right this time,

559
00:18:42,894 --> 00:18:44,893
- It's over. - we'll lose for sure.

560
00:18:44,894 --> 00:18:46,064
We must get this right.

561
00:18:46,065 --> 00:18:47,334
This is unexpected.

562
00:18:47,335 --> 00:18:49,104
Haha and Kwang Soo are in the lead.

563
00:18:49,105 --> 00:18:50,350
I know.

564
00:18:50,434 --> 00:18:51,673
We're the top two players.

565
00:18:51,674 --> 00:18:53,074
In my head,

566
00:18:53,075 --> 00:18:55,450
I'm thinking about how Haha is a good match for me.

567
00:18:55,545 --> 00:18:57,243
I think we should sit far away from each other...

568
00:18:57,244 --> 00:18:58,814
for those who don't know the answers.

569
00:18:58,815 --> 00:19:00,259
So that we can help them?

570
00:19:00,884 --> 00:19:02,743
- I keep thinking of him as a rival. - Come on.

571
00:19:02,744 --> 00:19:04,930
You guys got the right answer by coincidence.

572
00:19:05,815 --> 00:19:07,054
(They're the brainiacs of this week.)

573
00:19:07,055 --> 00:19:09,354
Let's do this. We need to get this right.

574
00:19:09,355 --> 00:19:11,124
I'm going to show you three photos of celebrities...

575
00:19:11,125 --> 00:19:12,999
- when they were young. - Okay.

576
00:19:13,494 --> 00:19:15,794
You need to guess the right celebrities.

577
00:19:15,795 --> 00:19:16,910
We need to get all of them right.

578
00:19:17,335 --> 00:19:18,564
I'm good at this.

579
00:19:18,565 --> 00:19:20,764
I'm known for being sharp-eyed.

580
00:19:20,765 --> 00:19:23,209
- 1, 2... - We need to get all three?

581
00:19:23,375 --> 00:19:24,549
I can't see.

582
00:19:24,634 --> 00:19:29,650
(You can guess as well.)

583
00:19:29,744 --> 00:19:31,614
- Can we take a closer look? - I can't see.

584
00:19:31,615 --> 00:19:33,413
- They're all different? - I can't see.

585
00:19:33,414 --> 00:19:34,844
- I know this one! - Me too.

586
00:19:34,845 --> 00:19:36,390
(1st and 2nd photos are easy to recognize.)

587
00:19:37,085 --> 00:19:38,289
I recognize the one in the middle.

588
00:19:38,654 --> 00:19:40,054
- Don't you recognize her? - First one is easy too.

589
00:19:40,055 --> 00:19:42,923
Right? But I don't recognize the last photo.

590
00:19:42,924 --> 00:19:44,624
Who is this? I'm stuck on the last one as well.

591
00:19:44,625 --> 00:19:45,824
I recognize them two.

592
00:19:45,825 --> 00:19:47,670
- Dimples? - It's on the tip of my tongue.

593
00:19:47,765 --> 00:19:49,663
Hold on a minute. Don't we...

594
00:19:49,664 --> 00:19:50,933
- Who is she? - What?

595
00:19:50,934 --> 00:19:51,993
Don't we...

596
00:19:51,994 --> 00:19:53,933
(Who is she?)

597
00:19:53,934 --> 00:19:55,564
Are you allowed to do that?

598
00:19:55,565 --> 00:19:56,933
- Is he allowed to do that? - No.

599
00:19:56,934 --> 00:19:58,650
- What's wrong? - I recognize her.

600
00:19:58,934 --> 00:20:00,403
- What? Wait. - She's old.

601
00:20:00,404 --> 00:20:03,713
- Isn't she from Gugudan? - Can we do this?

602
00:20:03,714 --> 00:20:05,044
- It's not her. - No?

603
00:20:05,045 --> 00:20:07,284
- This photo looks quite old. - Who is this?

604
00:20:07,285 --> 00:20:09,044
- This can't be Se Jeong. - It's an old photo.

605
00:20:09,045 --> 00:20:11,683
- I thought it was her. - The bricks say it's the 80s.

606
00:20:11,684 --> 00:20:12,913
- She looks like a rich kid. - Look.

607
00:20:12,914 --> 00:20:14,883
The background looks like one from the early 90s.

608
00:20:14,884 --> 00:20:16,153
- Look at her clothes. - So...

609
00:20:16,154 --> 00:20:18,653
I think she was born...

610
00:20:18,654 --> 00:20:20,223
- Which celebrity has dimples? - around the mid to late 80s.

611
00:20:20,224 --> 00:20:21,223
She's around my age.

612
00:20:21,224 --> 00:20:23,163
- Jae Seok! - He got it.

613
00:20:23,164 --> 00:20:25,233
- Hey, you shouldn't tell us. - He got it.

614
00:20:25,234 --> 00:20:27,264
- I won't. - Who is it?

615
00:20:27,265 --> 00:20:28,764
- You should tell us. - Then why did you ask?

616
00:20:28,765 --> 00:20:31,650
- Why would you ask him then? - Why would you?

617
00:20:32,005 --> 00:20:33,374
- You shouldn't tell us. - You shouldn't.

618
00:20:33,375 --> 00:20:34,703
Okay. Oh, this is team play.

619
00:20:34,704 --> 00:20:36,219
- Let me think. - Dimples?

620
00:20:36,375 --> 00:20:37,514
- She's a singer. - Right?

621
00:20:37,515 --> 00:20:39,374
- I'm right, aren't I? - It's a singer?

622
00:20:39,375 --> 00:20:41,443
Is she a singer? Give us that.

623
00:20:41,444 --> 00:20:43,314
- She's an actress. - I thought it was Kang Min Kyung.

624
00:20:43,315 --> 00:20:44,514
No.

625
00:20:44,515 --> 00:20:46,059
- I thought it was her. - Me too, but we're wrong.

626
00:20:48,125 --> 00:20:49,683
(Ji Hyo and Haha both exclaim at the same time.)

627
00:20:49,684 --> 00:20:52,100
- I knew it! - I got it!

628
00:20:52,694 --> 00:20:54,069
New Zealand!

629
00:20:54,164 --> 00:20:56,069
- Yes, you're right! - New Zealand!

630
00:20:56,095 --> 00:20:57,469
- Hey, hey. - What was that?

631
00:20:57,494 --> 00:21:00,180
- New Zealand! - No, it's Switzerland!

632
00:21:00,265 --> 00:21:01,709
- Switzerland? - Switzerland!

633
00:21:01,835 --> 00:21:03,009
Switzerland?

634
00:21:03,265 --> 00:21:04,604
Okay, we're done here.

635
00:21:04,605 --> 00:21:05,903
- Okay, okay. - Yes.

636
00:21:05,904 --> 00:21:07,473
I got it.

637
00:21:07,474 --> 00:21:09,203
- "I'm strong." - Yes, that's it.

638
00:21:09,204 --> 00:21:10,574
- That's it. - I know it.

639
00:21:10,575 --> 00:21:11,943
(Could she be...)

640
00:21:11,944 --> 00:21:15,160
(Kang Han Na?)

641
00:21:15,444 --> 00:21:16,514
I know it.

642
00:21:16,515 --> 00:21:18,630
- "I'm strong." - Be quiet!

643
00:21:18,785 --> 00:21:20,100
You shouldn't tell the others!

644
00:21:20,424 --> 00:21:22,130
I have no idea.

645
00:21:22,684 --> 00:21:24,769
(1st, 2nd, 3rd)

646
00:21:24,795 --> 00:21:27,364
(These girls all look so pretty and cute.)

647
00:21:27,365 --> 00:21:28,393
One,

648
00:21:28,394 --> 00:21:29,469
two,

649
00:21:29,724 --> 00:21:30,864
- three. - We got this.

650
00:21:30,865 --> 00:21:32,294
- We got this. - It's unanimous.

651
00:21:32,295 --> 00:21:34,180
- We got it. - Yes, we did.

652
00:21:34,765 --> 00:21:37,074
(Is Kim Yu Na, Lee Young Ae, and Kang Han Na correct?)

653
00:21:37,075 --> 00:21:38,979
- You've all succeeded. - Okay!

654
00:21:39,275 --> 00:21:40,473
You've all succeeded.

655
00:21:40,474 --> 00:21:41,703
(They may have broken all the rules,)

656
00:21:41,704 --> 00:21:42,943
(but they've gained a victory.)

657
00:21:42,944 --> 00:21:44,473
- Okay. - It was Han Na.

658
00:21:44,474 --> 00:21:47,183
- Yes. - This was her when she was little.

659
00:21:47,184 --> 00:21:49,660
- How adorable. - I can see it in her smile.

660
00:21:49,845 --> 00:21:51,854
Yu Na...

661
00:21:51,855 --> 00:21:53,423
- She was already famous back then. - haven't changed.

662
00:21:53,424 --> 00:21:56,284
- She was already famous. - Young Ae looks so beautiful.

663
00:21:56,285 --> 00:22:00,024
Gosh, look at Lee Young Ae. She was absolutely beautiful.

664
00:22:00,025 --> 00:22:02,124
I wonder why she isn't actively working anymore.

665
00:22:02,125 --> 00:22:04,133
- What? - She recently filmed a movie.

666
00:22:04,134 --> 00:22:05,834
- What? - It was recently released.

667
00:22:05,835 --> 00:22:07,233
My apologies.

668
00:22:07,234 --> 00:22:08,433
I just felt so bad, that's all.

669
00:22:08,434 --> 00:22:10,834
Why don't you know this when you're always on the Internet?

670
00:22:10,835 --> 00:22:12,334
He only reads the stock page.

671
00:22:12,335 --> 00:22:13,844
I can't believe this was Han Na.

672
00:22:13,845 --> 00:22:15,574
- Well, we secured 20 points. - Nice.

673
00:22:15,575 --> 00:22:16,680
Okay!

674
00:22:16,704 --> 00:22:18,749
All we need to get right are 2 40-point questions.

675
00:22:18,845 --> 00:22:20,259
All we have is 20 points?

676
00:22:20,515 --> 00:22:21,844
Shall we try another one?

677
00:22:21,845 --> 00:22:23,683
- Yes, one more. - Another one?

678
00:22:23,684 --> 00:22:25,789
- Let's double the score. - Right.

679
00:22:25,855 --> 00:22:26,930
Let's do this.

680
00:22:27,184 --> 00:22:28,459
Here you go.

681
00:22:28,724 --> 00:22:31,100
- The photos are too old. - Goodness.

682
00:22:32,924 --> 00:22:34,693
- This is HyunA. - Of course.

683
00:22:34,694 --> 00:22:36,024
- HyunA. - That's right.

684
00:22:36,025 --> 00:22:37,493
- Son Ye Jin! - Son Ye Jin?

685
00:22:37,494 --> 00:22:38,864
- Are you sure? - He's right.

686
00:22:38,865 --> 00:22:40,304
This boy is extremely handsome.

687
00:22:40,305 --> 00:22:41,534
- Ji Chang Wook! - No.

688
00:22:41,535 --> 00:22:43,733
- It's Lee Hong Gi. - Won Bin.

689
00:22:43,734 --> 00:22:44,933
Isn't it Won Bin?

690
00:22:44,934 --> 00:22:47,443
The nose and lips seem familiar.

691
00:22:47,444 --> 00:22:49,403
- It's Won Bin. - Isn't it Jung Woo Sung?

692
00:22:49,404 --> 00:22:51,213
- No, he's not like this. - No.

693
00:22:51,214 --> 00:22:53,614
He might not be so handsome now.

694
00:22:53,615 --> 00:22:56,713
Some people get uglier as they grow up.

695
00:22:56,714 --> 00:22:58,084
I was handsome as a boy too.

696
00:22:58,085 --> 00:23:00,084
Don't be absurd. We saw your photo.

697
00:23:00,085 --> 00:23:02,024
- Right, I forgot. - We saw your photo.

698
00:23:02,025 --> 00:23:04,370
(He quickly gives up.)

699
00:23:05,224 --> 00:23:07,393
- You were just the adorable type. - Right.

700
00:23:07,394 --> 00:23:09,764
- I'm completely clueless. - You have five seconds.

701
00:23:09,765 --> 00:23:12,133
You got Son Ye Jin and HyunA right.

702
00:23:12,134 --> 00:23:14,334
- Right? - Isn't it Jung Woo Sung?

703
00:23:14,335 --> 00:23:15,433
Yes, Jung Woo Sung.

704
00:23:15,434 --> 00:23:17,133
- Let's go with Jung Woo Sung. - Do it!

705
00:23:17,134 --> 00:23:18,473
In 1, 2, 3.

706
00:23:18,474 --> 00:23:19,574
- Jung Woo Sung. - Jung Woo Sung.

707
00:23:19,575 --> 00:23:21,344
(The members think it's Jung Woo Sung.)

708
00:23:21,345 --> 00:23:22,344
Did we get it right?

709
00:23:22,345 --> 00:23:24,190
(Is this Jung Woo Sung?)

710
00:23:24,714 --> 00:23:25,819
It's Hwang Jung Min.

711
00:23:26,474 --> 00:23:28,383
- No way! - It's Hwang Jung Min.

712
00:23:28,384 --> 00:23:29,913
(They're all baffled.)

713
00:23:29,914 --> 00:23:31,653
- You're lying. - Remember what I said?

714
00:23:31,654 --> 00:23:32,913
- Really? - What happened to him?

715
00:23:32,914 --> 00:23:34,284
- Unbelievable. - The mouth is the same.

716
00:23:34,285 --> 00:23:35,284
Is it really him?

717
00:23:35,285 --> 00:23:37,024
- Jung Min... - The face is still there.

718
00:23:37,025 --> 00:23:38,294
He's not this pretty now.

719
00:23:38,295 --> 00:23:41,940
We invited him on Introducing My Ugly Friends Festival.

720
00:23:42,464 --> 00:23:45,110
Doesn't it seem like he's provoking us?

721
00:23:45,134 --> 00:23:46,933
That brings your total to 40 points.

722
00:23:46,934 --> 00:23:48,703
- He was handsome. - My gosh.

723
00:23:48,704 --> 00:23:50,633
We would've never guessed that.

724
00:23:50,634 --> 00:23:52,034
It's impossible to guess right.

725
00:23:52,035 --> 00:23:53,034
(So the 20-point question in the People category is over.)

726
00:23:53,035 --> 00:23:55,874
Next up is the 30-point question in the People category.

727
00:23:55,875 --> 00:23:59,814
Here's the 30-point question in the People category.

728
00:23:59,815 --> 00:24:02,183
Please write down...

729
00:24:02,184 --> 00:24:05,483
eight different movies that this person was in.

730
00:24:05,484 --> 00:24:07,324
- Well... - If you write down...

731
00:24:07,325 --> 00:24:09,953
the same movie more than twice, or one the actor wasn't in,

732
00:24:09,954 --> 00:24:11,024
or the wrong title, you fail.

733
00:24:11,025 --> 00:24:12,124
We can't write down the same movie twice?

734
00:24:12,125 --> 00:24:13,963
- No. - Even among us?

735
00:24:13,964 --> 00:24:16,824
- I'll write the most famous one. - Me too.

736
00:24:16,825 --> 00:24:18,910
The celebrity this time is...

737
00:24:19,494 --> 00:24:20,534
Lee Byung Hun.

738
00:24:20,535 --> 00:24:22,133
(Actor Lee Byung Hun)

739
00:24:22,134 --> 00:24:23,304
- What about TV series? - Are TV series allowed?

740
00:24:23,305 --> 00:24:24,473
No, please stick to movies.

741
00:24:24,474 --> 00:24:26,479
Okay, no one will know this one.

742
00:24:26,974 --> 00:24:29,120
Don't write down the one from an elevated height.

743
00:24:29,244 --> 00:24:30,544
("Bungee Jumping Of Their Own")

744
00:24:30,545 --> 00:24:32,413
- What? - I was going to write that!

745
00:24:32,414 --> 00:24:33,643
No way.

746
00:24:33,644 --> 00:24:34,713
It's what I was going to write down.

747
00:24:34,714 --> 00:24:36,713
I'm suddenly confused by the movies he was in.

748
00:24:36,714 --> 00:24:38,084
I'll write down a foreign film.

749
00:24:38,085 --> 00:24:39,514
I'm sticking to a recent release.

750
00:24:39,515 --> 00:24:41,723
I'm going to rotate my wrist.

751
00:24:41,724 --> 00:24:42,754
Isn't this close to cheating?

752
00:24:42,755 --> 00:24:44,324
- Why? - I'm going to Thailand.

753
00:24:44,325 --> 00:24:47,299
I'm writing down something completely off the radar.

754
00:24:47,664 --> 00:24:49,539
I can't believe I even thought of this.

755
00:24:49,595 --> 00:24:51,564
You must write down the correct title.

756
00:24:51,565 --> 00:24:53,564
The correct... Wait, the full title?

757
00:24:53,565 --> 00:24:54,963
- In one... - I'm writing just the title.

758
00:24:54,964 --> 00:24:56,680
2, 3.

759
00:24:56,835 --> 00:24:57,910
All right.

760
00:24:58,704 --> 00:25:00,473
- Goodness. - Shall we begin with me?

761
00:25:00,474 --> 00:25:01,920
"The Harmonium In My Memory".

762
00:25:02,204 --> 00:25:03,243
- "Good, Bad, Weird". - "Good, Bad, Weird".

763
00:25:03,244 --> 00:25:05,173
- It's different from mine. - "Bungee Jumping Of Their Own".

764
00:25:05,174 --> 00:25:06,514
- Nice. - "Terminator".

765
00:25:06,515 --> 00:25:08,443
(Jong Kook has been cleared.)

766
00:25:08,444 --> 00:25:10,453
"Joint Security Area".

767
00:25:10,454 --> 00:25:12,259
- "Master". - "Inside Men".

768
00:25:12,285 --> 00:25:13,413
(All 7 of them wrote down different movies.)

769
00:25:13,414 --> 00:25:15,824
(They will win 30 points if So Min wrote a different one too.)

770
00:25:15,825 --> 00:25:17,294
- "Monster". - Was he in that movie?

771
00:25:17,295 --> 00:25:18,493
- He was. - Right?

772
00:25:18,494 --> 00:25:19,624
- It's an omnibus film. - "Monster".

773
00:25:19,625 --> 00:25:20,923
There is a movie of that title but...

774
00:25:20,924 --> 00:25:22,923
- An omnibus... Why? - Why?

775
00:25:22,924 --> 00:25:24,733
(What?)

776
00:25:24,734 --> 00:25:26,064
It's "Three, Monster."

777
00:25:26,065 --> 00:25:27,064
What?

778
00:25:27,065 --> 00:25:28,133
(The correct title is "Three, Monster.")

779
00:25:28,134 --> 00:25:30,104
(Because of So Min, they fail to earn more points.)

780
00:25:30,105 --> 00:25:31,673
Also, it's "The Good, The Bad, The Weird,"

781
00:25:31,674 --> 00:25:33,233
not "Good, Bad, Weird."

782
00:25:33,234 --> 00:25:35,304
- Is it "Three, Monster"? - We call it that for short.

783
00:25:35,305 --> 00:25:37,713
If that's the rule, then you should explain it again.

784
00:25:37,714 --> 00:25:38,814
This is wrong.

785
00:25:38,815 --> 00:25:41,459
Ji Hyo has a hard time understanding these things.

786
00:25:41,714 --> 00:25:43,683
She didn't quite understand the rules.

787
00:25:43,684 --> 00:25:45,854
We all shorten the title.

788
00:25:45,855 --> 00:25:47,223
He wasn't in "Monster" anyway.

789
00:25:47,224 --> 00:25:48,683
- "Monster" is incorrect. - "Three, Monster".

790
00:25:48,684 --> 00:25:50,493
- Do we have a spy among us? - But...

791
00:25:50,494 --> 00:25:51,953
- So Min... - Are you a spy?

792
00:25:51,954 --> 00:25:53,223
What's wrong with you?

793
00:25:53,224 --> 00:25:55,564
- Was this on purpose? - Do you want to dress up as Yondu?

794
00:25:55,565 --> 00:25:58,733
No, of course not. I don't want that at all.

795
00:25:58,734 --> 00:26:00,233
- Out of all the options... - But I...

796
00:26:00,234 --> 00:26:02,034
- What else is there? - "Bungee..."

797
00:26:02,035 --> 00:26:04,733
There is also "INSEPARABLE BROS."

798
00:26:04,734 --> 00:26:05,973
(The movie stars Kwang Soo and Shin Ha Kyun.)

799
00:26:05,974 --> 00:26:07,743
- Don't you agree? - That's what I said.

800
00:26:07,744 --> 00:26:08,743
That's the movie I wrote down.

801
00:26:08,744 --> 00:26:09,743
Right.

802
00:26:09,744 --> 00:26:10,913
- Now, you're upsetting me. - Gosh.

803
00:26:10,914 --> 00:26:12,514
When was Lee Byung Hun in that film?

804
00:26:12,515 --> 00:26:14,514
- I... - Are you trying to make me angry?

805
00:26:14,515 --> 00:26:16,213
- No, I... - Are you provoking me?

806
00:26:16,214 --> 00:26:17,653
That's not it.

807
00:26:17,654 --> 00:26:18,713
"Keys to the Heart".

808
00:26:18,714 --> 00:26:20,114
So Min, what's wrong with you?

809
00:26:20,115 --> 00:26:22,059
That was so close.

810
00:26:22,125 --> 00:26:23,653
This is your last chance.

811
00:26:23,654 --> 00:26:25,953
- Let's score some points. - We almost got it right.

812
00:26:25,954 --> 00:26:30,610
We'll now refrain from giving each other hints.

813
00:26:33,335 --> 00:26:35,340
You're the one who mentioned jumping from somewhere high.

814
00:26:36,434 --> 00:26:37,979
That wasn't much of a hint.

815
00:26:38,204 --> 00:26:39,703
All I did was rotate my wrist.

816
00:26:39,704 --> 00:26:41,450
Here we go then.

817
00:26:41,605 --> 00:26:42,749
Jeon Do Yeon.

818
00:26:43,444 --> 00:26:45,913
- I know one. - Don't do it.

819
00:26:45,914 --> 00:26:47,314
Don't write the one with the harmonium.

820
00:26:47,315 --> 00:26:48,483
That's mine!

821
00:26:48,484 --> 00:26:50,114
(He shamelessly calls dibs again.)

822
00:26:50,115 --> 00:26:51,789
- That's mine! - Hold on.

823
00:26:51,954 --> 00:26:53,084
- I'm going to write that one. - What's wrong with you?

824
00:26:53,085 --> 00:26:55,559
- Stop it! - Don't write it down.

825
00:26:55,825 --> 00:26:57,653
- Just don't. - If so,

826
00:26:57,654 --> 00:26:59,569
then it's the end of happiness.

827
00:27:00,194 --> 00:27:02,294
Hold on a second.

828
00:27:02,295 --> 00:27:03,594
- Okay, I won't write that one down. - Don't do it.

829
00:27:03,595 --> 00:27:05,009
I'm sorry.

830
00:27:05,595 --> 00:27:07,133
- That... - I'm sorry.

831
00:27:07,134 --> 00:27:10,009
- That's what I was going to write. - Well, don't.

832
00:27:10,105 --> 00:27:11,309
What else is there?

833
00:27:11,835 --> 00:27:13,009
Three...

834
00:27:13,234 --> 00:27:14,703
Someone else probably wrote this down.

835
00:27:14,704 --> 00:27:16,104
- Two... - Gosh.

836
00:27:16,105 --> 00:27:17,143
- One. Hold them up. - Just a second.

837
00:27:17,144 --> 00:27:18,213
I enjoyed this movie.

838
00:27:18,214 --> 00:27:19,844
Let's not blame anyone.

839
00:27:19,845 --> 00:27:20,913
Let's take a look.

840
00:27:20,914 --> 00:27:21,913
"A Promise".

841
00:27:21,914 --> 00:27:22,913
- "Birthday". - "Birthday".

842
00:27:22,914 --> 00:27:23,953
"The Harmonium Inside My Memory".

843
00:27:23,954 --> 00:27:26,014
- "A Promise". - "A Promise".

844
00:27:26,015 --> 00:27:27,824
(Se Chan and Jong Kook wrote down the same movie.)

845
00:27:27,825 --> 00:27:28,854
- "Secret Sunshine". - "Happy End".

846
00:27:28,855 --> 00:27:30,653
- "The Contact". - Unbelievable.

847
00:27:30,654 --> 00:27:31,953
"The Contact" and "Happy End".

848
00:27:31,954 --> 00:27:34,193
There are two entries for "A Promise"...

849
00:27:34,194 --> 00:27:35,193
and it's "The Harmonium In My Memory."

850
00:27:35,194 --> 00:27:36,193
Did you write "inside" instead?

851
00:27:36,194 --> 00:27:38,670
I wrote down the correct title minutes ago.

852
00:27:39,595 --> 00:27:42,104
Is it "in" or "inside"?

853
00:27:42,105 --> 00:27:43,933
Isn't it "inside"?

854
00:27:43,934 --> 00:27:45,034
Right, of course.

855
00:27:45,035 --> 00:27:47,034
- Yes, "inside." - Right, instead of "in."

856
00:27:47,035 --> 00:27:48,120
(Yes, "inside" sounds better.)

857
00:27:48,545 --> 00:27:50,344
I wrote down the correct title minutes ago.

858
00:27:50,345 --> 00:27:53,319
He tends to watch movies that have slightly different titles.

859
00:27:53,674 --> 00:27:54,913
- Jae Seok... - You mean adult films?

860
00:27:54,914 --> 00:27:56,483
Those with slightly different titles.

861
00:27:56,484 --> 00:27:58,514
- Is this a rated R movie? - Of course not.

862
00:27:58,515 --> 00:28:00,723
Where inside is this harmonium?

863
00:28:00,724 --> 00:28:02,324
Tell us about this adult film.

864
00:28:02,325 --> 00:28:04,423
For instance... Let me see.

865
00:28:04,424 --> 00:28:06,100
Like "Hairy Something"?

866
00:28:06,194 --> 00:28:07,193
A title that's slightly different.

867
00:28:07,194 --> 00:28:09,469
"Aroused" instead of "Yonggary"?

868
00:28:09,595 --> 00:28:11,469
There's also "Swiri for a Moment."

869
00:28:12,035 --> 00:28:13,693
"Swiri for a Moment"?

870
00:28:13,694 --> 00:28:14,764
(He bursts out laughing.)

871
00:28:14,765 --> 00:28:15,864
- That one exists. - It exists.

872
00:28:15,865 --> 00:28:17,973
- I remember seeing that title. - Me too.

873
00:28:17,974 --> 00:28:19,979
My friend's family used to own a DVD rental shop.

874
00:28:20,335 --> 00:28:22,574
- "Swiri for a Moment"? - It was famous in our school.

875
00:28:22,575 --> 00:28:24,213
- "Aroused". - "Swiri for a Moment".

876
00:28:24,214 --> 00:28:26,014
- Well, you failed this round. - It's difficult.

877
00:28:26,015 --> 00:28:28,483
I can't believe we couldn't grasp this chance.

878
00:28:28,484 --> 00:28:30,953
Well, you currently have 40 points.

879
00:28:30,954 --> 00:28:32,284
Give us one worth 60 points.

880
00:28:32,285 --> 00:28:33,514
- 60 points? - We won't conspire.

881
00:28:33,515 --> 00:28:34,653
Just one single question.

882
00:28:34,654 --> 00:28:36,024
- Just one? - Yes.

883
00:28:36,025 --> 00:28:38,493
Okay, I'll give you one more.

884
00:28:38,494 --> 00:28:40,493
This is worth 60 points.

885
00:28:40,494 --> 00:28:42,693
- It was worth 40 points. - Okay.

886
00:28:42,694 --> 00:28:44,034
- You'll give us 60 points? - Let's go up to the front.

887
00:28:44,035 --> 00:28:46,294
- Okay, let's go this. - I will show you a person.

888
00:28:46,295 --> 00:28:48,203
- Write down his full name. - His full name?

889
00:28:48,204 --> 00:28:49,604
He must be a foreigner.

890
00:28:49,605 --> 00:28:51,880
In 1, 2, 3.

891
00:28:52,434 --> 00:28:54,973
(Many sigh upon seeing who it is.)

892
00:28:54,974 --> 00:28:56,443
- No way. - Gosh.

893
00:28:56,444 --> 00:28:57,789
We're doomed. I have no idea.

894
00:28:57,815 --> 00:29:00,074
I know who it is, but I don't know his full name.

895
00:29:00,075 --> 00:29:02,383
I know him too, but not his full name.

896
00:29:02,384 --> 00:29:04,114
I'm suddenly confused.

897
00:29:04,115 --> 00:29:05,559
(Even the smart Jae Seok seems confused.)

898
00:29:05,815 --> 00:29:09,529
(Vladimir Putin, President of Russia)

899
00:29:10,184 --> 00:29:11,824
You know the two syllables, right?

900
00:29:11,825 --> 00:29:12,824
- Yes. - Of course.

901
00:29:12,825 --> 00:29:14,923
- He's the President of Russia. - Right.

902
00:29:14,924 --> 00:29:15,923
I only know those two syllables.

903
00:29:15,924 --> 00:29:17,094
- Same here. - Me too.

904
00:29:17,095 --> 00:29:18,094
(Even Ji Hyo seems to know Putin.)

905
00:29:18,095 --> 00:29:19,269
Is it Bush?

906
00:29:20,605 --> 00:29:22,304
(Bush is the only President she knows with a two-syllables name.)

907
00:29:22,305 --> 00:29:24,209
- Who is it? - Putin.

908
00:29:24,605 --> 00:29:26,473
- Putin. - Putin?

909
00:29:26,474 --> 00:29:27,544
Who's that?

910
00:29:27,545 --> 00:29:28,650
(I haven't heard of him before.)

911
00:29:29,045 --> 00:29:30,989
- Russia... - Tell us the last syllable.

912
00:29:31,115 --> 00:29:33,014
I don't know his full name.

913
00:29:33,015 --> 00:29:34,443
Can we at least know the first syllable?

914
00:29:34,444 --> 00:29:35,544
- The first one. - Just the first one.

915
00:29:35,545 --> 00:29:37,913
His first name is of five Korean syllables.

916
00:29:37,914 --> 00:29:39,413
- Five? - Tell us the first one.

917
00:29:39,414 --> 00:29:41,024
Then you'll be able to guess it.

918
00:29:41,025 --> 00:29:42,483
- We won't. - I doubt it.

919
00:29:42,484 --> 00:29:44,393
- I'm sure of it. - Some don't even know...

920
00:29:44,394 --> 00:29:45,393
his last name.

921
00:29:45,394 --> 00:29:47,963
- Exactly. - Somebody doesn't even know that.

922
00:29:47,964 --> 00:29:50,534
Then I'll tell you the last letter of his first name.

923
00:29:50,535 --> 00:29:52,569
It's probably a P or a T.

924
00:29:52,934 --> 00:29:54,380
It ends with an R.

925
00:29:54,934 --> 00:29:57,309
Really? I thought it ended with an S.

926
00:29:58,674 --> 00:30:00,374
My answer ends with an S.

927
00:30:00,375 --> 00:30:01,819
I don't have a clue.

928
00:30:02,545 --> 00:30:06,374
I have to get this right in order to elevate my status on this show.

929
00:30:06,375 --> 00:30:08,213
This one's too hard.

930
00:30:08,214 --> 00:30:09,383
Hold up your answers.

931
00:30:09,384 --> 00:30:10,683
(They show their answers one by one.)

932
00:30:10,684 --> 00:30:12,314
(Remibonjar Putin)

933
00:30:12,315 --> 00:30:13,789
What?

934
00:30:14,025 --> 00:30:16,200
(Why are they laughing?)

935
00:30:17,724 --> 00:30:19,393
Just so you know, I answered it in all seriousness.

936
00:30:19,394 --> 00:30:20,663
I wrote down anything that made sense.

937
00:30:20,664 --> 00:30:22,840
I'll go first.

938
00:30:23,194 --> 00:30:25,769
I wrote Remibonjar Putin.

939
00:30:26,535 --> 00:30:27,564
Remibonjar Putin.

940
00:30:27,565 --> 00:30:31,504
There's an MMA fighter named Remy Bonjasky.

941
00:30:31,505 --> 00:30:32,534
I get why he got them mixed up.

942
00:30:32,535 --> 00:30:34,880
Let me now see Ji Hyo's answer.

943
00:30:35,204 --> 00:30:37,413
- Is she kidding me? - I think it's right.

944
00:30:37,414 --> 00:30:39,190
Really? Are you serious?

945
00:30:39,845 --> 00:30:40,844
No way.

946
00:30:40,845 --> 00:30:43,360
(Did she write down Vladimir Putin?)

947
00:30:45,315 --> 00:30:46,683
- I take that back. - Ji Hyo got it right?

948
00:30:46,684 --> 00:30:49,259
- What did she write? - I only saw the last syllable.

949
00:30:49,384 --> 00:30:51,200
She wrote down Parrrrrr Putin.

950
00:30:51,855 --> 00:30:53,529
Parrrrrr Putin.

951
00:30:54,164 --> 00:30:56,024
- Jong Kook... - I have no idea.

952
00:30:56,025 --> 00:30:57,933
- Mir Putin. - It was something-mir.

953
00:30:57,934 --> 00:31:00,910
Seok Jin wrote Sultanvarrr Putin.

954
00:31:01,505 --> 00:31:04,304
- Haha wrote Emelessor Putin. - Emelessor.

955
00:31:04,305 --> 00:31:06,110
Emelessor Putin.

956
00:31:06,734 --> 00:31:08,403
Emelessor...

957
00:31:08,404 --> 00:31:10,420
- Wasn't it good? - Kwang Soo... It's a good one.

958
00:31:10,644 --> 00:31:11,844
Bessamor Putin.

959
00:31:11,845 --> 00:31:12,920
(Proud)

960
00:31:13,075 --> 00:31:14,289
Bessamor.

961
00:31:14,585 --> 00:31:16,059
Emelessor.

962
00:31:16,414 --> 00:31:18,314
(Omegador Putin)

963
00:31:18,315 --> 00:31:20,059
Omegador Putin.

964
00:31:21,085 --> 00:31:22,923
- It sounds like a supplement. - Bessamor.

965
00:31:22,924 --> 00:31:24,423
- Omega? - Omegador.

966
00:31:24,424 --> 00:31:26,693
- It suddenly came to me. - Sultanvarrr Putin.

967
00:31:26,694 --> 00:31:28,024
Emelessor.

968
00:31:28,025 --> 00:31:29,463
It's Vladimir Putin.

969
00:31:29,464 --> 00:31:31,294
- I think this is it. - Is it?

970
00:31:31,295 --> 00:31:33,534
The answer is Vladimir Putin.

971
00:31:33,535 --> 00:31:35,203
- That's right. - Yes, this.

972
00:31:35,204 --> 00:31:36,433
I only could think of "mir."

973
00:31:36,434 --> 00:31:38,834
- We went to Vladivostok, remember? - It was too difficult.

974
00:31:38,835 --> 00:31:40,433
I only could think of "mir."

975
00:31:40,434 --> 00:31:42,044
I couldn't have guessed it.

976
00:31:42,045 --> 00:31:44,413
I'm sure that some didn't even know Putin.

977
00:31:44,414 --> 00:31:45,690
I didn't.

978
00:31:46,444 --> 00:31:49,743
So you failed the first round.

979
00:31:49,744 --> 00:31:52,213
One will at least receive the penalty today.

980
00:31:52,214 --> 00:31:53,314
One?

981
00:31:53,315 --> 00:31:54,653
It shouldn't be either Haha or me.

982
00:31:54,654 --> 00:31:56,883
- I did a good job on the quiz. - However,

983
00:31:56,884 --> 00:31:58,524
do you see the booth in the back?

984
00:31:58,525 --> 00:32:00,594
Even though you guys failed the mission,

985
00:32:00,595 --> 00:32:02,824
you can still win candies.

986
00:32:02,825 --> 00:32:05,633
The staff will say a certain range of numbers.

987
00:32:05,634 --> 00:32:07,193
Each of you will go to the booth...

988
00:32:07,194 --> 00:32:10,433
and hand in as many candies as you want in private.

989
00:32:10,434 --> 00:32:12,874
If the total number of candies handed in...

990
00:32:12,875 --> 00:32:14,743
happens to be in the given range,

991
00:32:14,744 --> 00:32:17,413
you'll win double the number of candies you handed in.

992
00:32:17,414 --> 00:32:18,473
We get more candies?

993
00:32:18,474 --> 00:32:20,413
However, if the number is outside the range,

994
00:32:20,414 --> 00:32:22,719
you'll lose the candies you handed in.

995
00:32:23,244 --> 00:32:26,014
We've done something similar before.

996
00:32:26,015 --> 00:32:27,014
- Right. - Yes.

997
00:32:27,015 --> 00:32:28,284
We have to hand in more than a certain amount.

998
00:32:28,285 --> 00:32:29,923
- But if some people don't... - But if some people don't,

999
00:32:29,924 --> 00:32:31,130
it's annoying.

1000
00:32:31,154 --> 00:32:32,900
Here's the range.

1001
00:32:33,055 --> 00:32:35,670
The first range is...

1002
00:32:36,065 --> 00:32:38,393
between 19 and 29.

1003
00:32:38,394 --> 00:32:39,463
That's a lot.

1004
00:32:39,464 --> 00:32:41,403
- Hand in 19... - That's a lot.

1005
00:32:41,404 --> 00:32:42,564
to 29 candies.

1006
00:32:42,565 --> 00:32:43,564
To hand in 19 candies in total...

1007
00:32:43,565 --> 00:32:44,574
There are eight of us.

1008
00:32:44,575 --> 00:32:46,473
3 times 7 equals 21. 3 times 8 equals 24.

1009
00:32:46,474 --> 00:32:48,880
This is the first round. There's no reason not to hand in anything.

1010
00:32:48,904 --> 00:32:51,574
- We just have to hand in 3 each. - Yes, 3 each.

1011
00:32:51,575 --> 00:32:53,590
- If you don't, you're stupid. - All right. Let's do that.

1012
00:32:53,845 --> 00:32:55,114
Don't say Kwang Soo is stupid.

1013
00:32:55,115 --> 00:32:56,413
(Don't call him stupid.)

1014
00:32:56,414 --> 00:32:58,360
- One by one... - He can.

1015
00:32:58,615 --> 00:33:00,413
He's obviously joking.

1016
00:33:00,414 --> 00:33:03,400
You can go to the booth one by one in private.

1017
00:33:03,555 --> 00:33:06,124
- It'd be safer to hand in four. - That'd be safer.

1018
00:33:06,125 --> 00:33:07,499
That'd be safer.

1019
00:33:08,065 --> 00:33:09,469
- It won't exceed the number either. - Exactly.

1020
00:33:09,894 --> 00:33:11,309
Let's start.

1021
00:33:11,494 --> 00:33:12,709
Let me go first.

1022
00:33:15,164 --> 00:33:17,410
(Jong Kook hands in 4 as promised.)

1023
00:33:19,605 --> 00:33:21,420
(It's Ji Hyo's turn.)

1024
00:33:22,275 --> 00:33:23,380
I'm handing in four.

1025
00:33:24,315 --> 00:33:26,350
- Can I go next? - Okay.

1026
00:33:26,744 --> 00:33:28,643
(Se Chan somehow looks excited.)

1027
00:33:28,644 --> 00:33:31,190
Guys, you have to hand in the minimum amount.

1028
00:33:31,785 --> 00:33:32,890
I'm handing in four.

1029
00:33:33,115 --> 00:33:34,423
I'm handing in four.

1030
00:33:34,424 --> 00:33:37,229
(Instead of being greedy, Se Chan kept his word.)

1031
00:33:37,384 --> 00:33:38,930
You don't even have to think.

1032
00:33:39,194 --> 00:33:40,193
What?

1033
00:33:40,194 --> 00:33:41,864
- I saw it. - What?

1034
00:33:41,865 --> 00:33:43,223
- You didn't hand in anything. - I did.

1035
00:33:43,224 --> 00:33:44,433
- I did. - You didn't?

1036
00:33:44,434 --> 00:33:46,233
- I did. - You should.

1037
00:33:46,234 --> 00:33:48,034
- I did. - I saw it.

1038
00:33:48,035 --> 00:33:49,209
I handed them in.

1039
00:33:50,065 --> 00:33:53,133
(Everyone is done.)

1040
00:33:53,134 --> 00:33:56,104
Let me announce the number of candies handed in.

1041
00:33:56,105 --> 00:33:57,574
- How many? - It has to be over 19.

1042
00:33:57,575 --> 00:34:00,883
(If the number is between 19 and 29, they can win more candies.)

1043
00:34:00,884 --> 00:34:04,284
You handed in 16 candies. You failed.

1044
00:34:04,285 --> 00:34:06,784
I can't believe you guys.

1045
00:34:06,785 --> 00:34:08,453
- You can't do this. - Unbelievable.

1046
00:34:08,454 --> 00:34:09,854
Why are you smiling?

1047
00:34:09,855 --> 00:34:11,393
- You guys! - Who...

1048
00:34:11,394 --> 00:34:13,299
Gosh, it's annoying!

1049
00:34:13,494 --> 00:34:14,763
I can't believe it.

1050
00:34:14,764 --> 00:34:17,069
(How many candies did each member hand in?)

1051
00:34:17,195 --> 00:34:18,339
I'm handing in one.

1052
00:34:19,094 --> 00:34:21,634
(So Min handed in only one to avoid ending up at the bottom.)

1053
00:34:21,635 --> 00:34:24,450
(Seok Jin handed in 3.)

1054
00:34:25,835 --> 00:34:27,350
I'm holding candies in my hand.

1055
00:34:28,045 --> 00:34:29,803
(After the confident announcement,)

1056
00:34:29,804 --> 00:34:31,774
(these three handed in zero candies.)

1057
00:34:31,775 --> 00:34:34,790
(Haha, Jae Seok, and Kwang Soo loses no candies.)

1058
00:34:35,045 --> 00:34:36,620
The four of us got fooled again.

1059
00:34:37,014 --> 00:34:38,113
- You didn't hand in anything. - I did.

1060
00:34:38,114 --> 00:34:39,884
- You didn't. Neither did Haha. - I did.

1061
00:34:39,885 --> 00:34:41,024
I can swear I did.

1062
00:34:41,025 --> 00:34:42,884
- I handed in so many. - Guys.

1063
00:34:42,885 --> 00:34:44,453
We're the ones who handed them in.

1064
00:34:44,454 --> 00:34:46,694
- I think four people did. - The first ones did.

1065
00:34:46,695 --> 00:34:47,993
- Four people did. - You handed in 10,

1066
00:34:47,994 --> 00:34:49,593
- and I handed in six. - I handed them in too.

1067
00:34:49,594 --> 00:34:50,834
I wanted more candies.

1068
00:34:50,835 --> 00:34:52,263
- If we get penalized, - This is shocking.

1069
00:34:52,264 --> 00:34:54,339
we'll choose one of those guys.

1070
00:34:54,565 --> 00:34:55,910
- Not me! - Why me?

1071
00:34:56,005 --> 00:34:57,104
(They all pretend to be innocent.)

1072
00:34:57,105 --> 00:34:59,004
- I'm innocent. - Why would you say that?

1073
00:34:59,005 --> 00:35:00,703
- We'll choose one of you guys. - I handed them in.

1074
00:35:00,704 --> 00:35:02,674
- I'm innocent. - I can't believe this.

1075
00:35:02,675 --> 00:35:04,489
That's just your prejudice. I handed them in.

1076
00:35:04,775 --> 00:35:07,020
I handed them in.

1077
00:35:07,585 --> 00:35:08,759
I really did.

1078
00:35:10,144 --> 00:35:12,453
I saw that you did not hand in anything.

1079
00:35:12,454 --> 00:35:13,854
- Me? - Yes.

1080
00:35:13,855 --> 00:35:16,053
- I did. - Gosh.

1081
00:35:16,054 --> 00:35:17,524
I'm disappointed in you.

1082
00:35:17,525 --> 00:35:18,624
You don't know yet.

1083
00:35:18,625 --> 00:35:20,964
- Let's eat in the second round. - Let's go.

1084
00:35:20,965 --> 00:35:22,024
Let's go.

1085
00:35:22,025 --> 00:35:23,663
Whatever, the war is on.

1086
00:35:23,664 --> 00:35:24,810
(With some people frustrated, they move on to Round 2.)

1087
00:35:25,364 --> 00:35:26,464
We'll be penalized.

1088
00:35:26,465 --> 00:35:27,779
I'll be penalized.

1089
00:35:27,934 --> 00:35:29,904
- Is everyone here? - Yes.

1090
00:35:29,905 --> 00:35:31,250
You came last, punk.

1091
00:35:31,675 --> 00:35:32,980
Watch your language.

1092
00:35:33,835 --> 00:35:35,319
You're younger than me anyway.

1093
00:35:35,445 --> 00:35:37,549
- You debuted later than me. - You debuted later than Jae Seok.

1094
00:35:37,644 --> 00:35:39,573
When will you stop saying that?

1095
00:35:39,574 --> 00:35:41,343
- It doesn't matter anymore. - What do you mean?

1096
00:35:41,344 --> 00:35:43,283
It doesn't matter. I'm older than you.

1097
00:35:43,284 --> 00:35:44,930
You're older than me?

1098
00:35:44,985 --> 00:35:47,183
- Did I just sound like a fossil? - You did.

1099
00:35:47,184 --> 00:35:49,359
- Totally. - Completely.

1100
00:35:49,485 --> 00:35:51,254
Even my mom thinks you're an old fossil.

1101
00:35:51,255 --> 00:35:53,294
(Even my mom thinks you're an old fossil.)

1102
00:35:53,295 --> 00:35:55,464
(Even someone his age agrees.)

1103
00:35:55,465 --> 00:35:56,669
While watching TV,

1104
00:35:57,125 --> 00:35:58,734
she said, "Mr. Jee definitely is an old fossil."

1105
00:35:58,735 --> 00:36:01,604
- "Mr. Jee". - That's good.

1106
00:36:01,605 --> 00:36:03,234
You should debut as a trot singer called Fossil.

1107
00:36:03,235 --> 00:36:04,803
- That's a good idea. - Fossil Jee.

1108
00:36:04,804 --> 00:36:06,104
- That's right. - Fossil Jee.

1109
00:36:06,105 --> 00:36:08,343
I'm not a fossil

1110
00:36:08,344 --> 00:36:09,573
- That's not it. - That's not it.

1111
00:36:09,574 --> 00:36:10,843
I'm a fossil, so what?

1112
00:36:10,844 --> 00:36:13,520
(I'm a fossil, so what?)

1113
00:36:14,684 --> 00:36:17,489
I'm a fossil, so what?

1114
00:36:17,655 --> 00:36:21,084
I'm a fossil wannabe

1115
00:36:21,085 --> 00:36:22,299
A fossil wannabe?

1116
00:36:22,355 --> 00:36:24,060
What's that?

1117
00:36:24,355 --> 00:36:26,029
- Seok Jin. - The title is, "In My Time".

1118
00:36:26,655 --> 00:36:29,439
- In my time - "In the Old Days".

1119
00:36:29,795 --> 00:36:32,393
In the old days

1120
00:36:32,394 --> 00:36:35,663
- You should do a series. - That sounds good.

1121
00:36:35,664 --> 00:36:36,734
In the old days

1122
00:36:36,735 --> 00:36:39,604
Everyone calls me an old fossil

1123
00:36:39,605 --> 00:36:42,250
Even an old fossil can love

1124
00:36:43,275 --> 00:36:45,143
Even though I'm married

1125
00:36:45,144 --> 00:36:47,649
I'm on my own

1126
00:36:49,644 --> 00:36:51,984
(Catchy)

1127
00:36:51,985 --> 00:36:53,754
- Old people would love it. - Of course.

1128
00:36:53,755 --> 00:36:54,754
(The fossil anthem is complete.)

1129
00:36:54,755 --> 00:36:58,453
This mission can give you lunch and ice cream hotteoks.

1130
00:36:58,454 --> 00:36:59,823
The second mission is called...

1131
00:36:59,824 --> 00:37:01,924
- Food My Way. - "Food My Way"?

1132
00:37:01,925 --> 00:37:03,140
Ice cream hotteoks?

1133
00:37:03,565 --> 00:37:06,794
There are 8 dishes that cost between 50 cents...

1134
00:37:06,795 --> 00:37:08,334
and 15 dollars.

1135
00:37:08,335 --> 00:37:10,879
You'll choose one dish in private.

1136
00:37:11,335 --> 00:37:12,404
Ramyeon sounds nice.

1137
00:37:12,405 --> 00:37:14,944
If the dishes you chose cost less than 30 dollars in total,

1138
00:37:14,945 --> 00:37:16,573
- you all pass... - "Less than 30 dollars"?

1139
00:37:16,574 --> 00:37:19,113
and can eat what you chose.

1140
00:37:19,114 --> 00:37:21,214
If the dishes you chose cost 30 to 50 dollars in total,

1141
00:37:21,215 --> 00:37:23,044
you don't pass,

1142
00:37:23,045 --> 00:37:25,254
but you can still eat what you chose.

1143
00:37:25,255 --> 00:37:27,053
- Oh, my. This is tricky. - But if the dishes cost...

1144
00:37:27,054 --> 00:37:29,223
more than 50 dollars in total, you fail the mission...

1145
00:37:29,224 --> 00:37:32,723
- and get only rice and soy sauce. - To be honest,

1146
00:37:32,724 --> 00:37:35,093
I'm not even considering a filling course meal...

1147
00:37:35,094 --> 00:37:37,263
- or soy sauce marinated crab. - Me neither.

1148
00:37:37,264 --> 00:37:39,064
- Me neither. - I'll go for tteokbokki.

1149
00:37:39,065 --> 00:37:42,009
If we give up on soy sauce marinated crab and a course meal,

1150
00:37:42,065 --> 00:37:43,310
we can succeed.

1151
00:37:43,534 --> 00:37:45,480
- I'm craving tteokbokki. - Can I have a cola?

1152
00:37:45,505 --> 00:37:47,643
Just get rice and soup and be satisfied.

1153
00:37:47,644 --> 00:37:48,674
(He suddenly sounds like a fossil.)

1154
00:37:48,675 --> 00:37:50,104
Why do you say that?

1155
00:37:50,105 --> 00:37:51,989
Jong Kook, don't be so strict.

1156
00:37:52,315 --> 00:37:54,214
Jong Kook is a half-fossil.

1157
00:37:54,215 --> 00:37:55,643
(Jong Kook is a half-fossil.)

1158
00:37:55,644 --> 00:37:57,890
(Kim Jong Kook, a fossil in progress)

1159
00:37:58,155 --> 00:37:59,953
- Right. - He's halfway there.

1160
00:37:59,954 --> 00:38:01,154
That tone of yours.

1161
00:38:01,155 --> 00:38:02,154
- So Min. - Yes?

1162
00:38:02,155 --> 00:38:03,924
Let me ask you something.

1163
00:38:03,925 --> 00:38:05,393
Including yourself,

1164
00:38:05,394 --> 00:38:08,493
who's the worst old fossil here?

1165
00:38:08,494 --> 00:38:09,964
- Hey, Mr. Old Fossil. - You.

1166
00:38:09,965 --> 00:38:11,669
(Hey, Mr. Old Fossil.)

1167
00:38:11,864 --> 00:38:12,969
You.

1168
00:38:13,235 --> 00:38:15,104
What were you expecting?

1169
00:38:15,105 --> 00:38:16,879
- Jae Seok. - Did you think you weren't?

1170
00:38:16,905 --> 00:38:18,734
Jae Seok, look at this.

1171
00:38:18,735 --> 00:38:21,904
All of you here from Haha to Jong Kook are old fossils.

1172
00:38:21,905 --> 00:38:24,444
(The Old Fossil Belt is from Haha to Jong Kook.)

1173
00:38:24,445 --> 00:38:25,919
(Shocked)

1174
00:38:25,974 --> 00:38:27,613
Haha, you're one too.

1175
00:38:27,614 --> 00:38:29,359
- You're one too. - You're one too.

1176
00:38:29,545 --> 00:38:31,189
You little punks!

1177
00:38:32,755 --> 00:38:34,314
You little punks.

1178
00:38:34,315 --> 00:38:35,424
(Old fossils lose their temper easily.)

1179
00:38:35,425 --> 00:38:36,484
- You! - See?

1180
00:38:36,485 --> 00:38:39,093
Haha sounds totally like an old fossil when he's drunk.

1181
00:38:39,094 --> 00:38:40,093
He is.

1182
00:38:40,094 --> 00:38:41,500
He brags so much.

1183
00:38:42,164 --> 00:38:43,564
You should stop that.

1184
00:38:43,565 --> 00:38:46,163
- And he talks about his past a lot. - Why would you do that?

1185
00:38:46,164 --> 00:38:48,404
He never stopped talking.

1186
00:38:48,405 --> 00:38:50,009
Stop your nonsense!

1187
00:38:50,034 --> 00:38:51,680
I'm serious.

1188
00:38:52,175 --> 00:38:54,404
(Haha pretends to be angry.)

1189
00:38:54,405 --> 00:38:55,404
You're an old fossil too.

1190
00:38:55,405 --> 00:38:57,573
We're all old fossils

1191
00:38:57,574 --> 00:38:59,919
Let me say something that totally sounds like an old fossil.

1192
00:39:00,244 --> 00:39:01,283
Stop shooting.

1193
00:39:01,284 --> 00:39:03,444
(Stop shooting.)

1194
00:39:03,445 --> 00:39:05,013
Are you going to air all of this?

1195
00:39:05,014 --> 00:39:06,513
- Are you going to air all of this? - Stop shooting.

1196
00:39:06,514 --> 00:39:07,854
That's what an old fossil sounds like.

1197
00:39:07,855 --> 00:39:09,783
- We've got enough. Stop shooting. - Stop shooting.

1198
00:39:09,784 --> 00:39:12,529
If I'm going to be an old fossil anyway, I want to be a cool one.

1199
00:39:12,655 --> 00:39:15,969
- I want to be a cool old fossil - I want to be a cool old fossil

1200
00:39:15,994 --> 00:39:17,524
Put those cameras away.

1201
00:39:17,525 --> 00:39:19,593
I said, stop shooting! Put those cameras away!

1202
00:39:19,594 --> 00:39:21,779
You'll go into the restaurant one by one.

1203
00:39:23,565 --> 00:39:25,274
- Haha, go first. - Should I go first?

1204
00:39:25,275 --> 00:39:26,803
Make the right choice.

1205
00:39:26,804 --> 00:39:29,279
- I'll have ramyeon. - Okay.

1206
00:39:31,414 --> 00:39:32,843
What's that?

1207
00:39:32,844 --> 00:39:33,950
Oh, my.

1208
00:39:35,485 --> 00:39:37,219
We get to eat this if we succeed?

1209
00:39:37,855 --> 00:39:39,460
Oh, my gosh.

1210
00:39:39,554 --> 00:39:41,484
Ice cream hotteoks? They look amazing.

1211
00:39:41,485 --> 00:39:43,783
Seed hotteoks with ice cream?

1212
00:39:43,784 --> 00:39:44,870
My mouth is watering.

1213
00:39:45,454 --> 00:39:47,029
We have to succeed to eat this, right?

1214
00:39:47,125 --> 00:39:48,500
See you in a bit.

1215
00:39:48,994 --> 00:39:50,424
Their pork cutlets are delicious.

1216
00:39:50,425 --> 00:39:52,893
(In the restaurant, Haha is welcomed by...)

1217
00:39:52,894 --> 00:39:54,393
Look at that pork cutlet. Oh, my.

1218
00:39:54,394 --> 00:39:55,839
(A feast is prepared.)

1219
00:39:56,505 --> 00:39:59,433
(A filling course meal)

1220
00:39:59,434 --> 00:40:02,004
(Plump, soy sauce marinated crab)

1221
00:40:02,005 --> 00:40:05,319
(Crispy pork cutlets)

1222
00:40:05,715 --> 00:40:12,560
(The chosen dishes have to cost less than 30 dollars in total.)

1223
00:40:13,284 --> 00:40:15,124
(Now that he's seen the food...)

1224
00:40:15,125 --> 00:40:17,124
Gosh, what do I do?

1225
00:40:17,125 --> 00:40:18,399
What do I do with this food?

1226
00:40:20,295 --> 00:40:21,424
This...

1227
00:40:21,425 --> 00:40:22,723
I've been craving pork cutlets all day.

1228
00:40:22,724 --> 00:40:23,939
My mouth is watering.

1229
00:40:25,135 --> 00:40:26,964
I wouldn't dare to choose a filling course meal,

1230
00:40:26,965 --> 00:40:28,680
but pork cutlets might be okay.

1231
00:40:29,164 --> 00:40:30,703
Choose 1 dish on the count of 3. 1, 2, 3.

1232
00:40:30,704 --> 00:40:32,504
(Can Haha resist the pork cutlet?)

1233
00:40:32,505 --> 00:40:33,674
A pork cutlet meal.

1234
00:40:33,675 --> 00:40:35,973
(He chooses a 7-dollar pork cutlet meal.)

1235
00:40:35,974 --> 00:40:37,104
I'll have that.

1236
00:40:37,105 --> 00:40:38,643
(The pork cutlet makes Haha betray his team members.)

1237
00:40:38,644 --> 00:40:40,290
That looks fantastic.

1238
00:40:42,445 --> 00:40:44,854
(It's Ji Hyo's turn.)

1239
00:40:44,855 --> 00:40:46,884
Gosh, seeing all this food...

1240
00:40:46,885 --> 00:40:48,399
is driving me crazy.

1241
00:40:48,684 --> 00:40:50,230
I love this dish.

1242
00:40:50,255 --> 00:40:51,924
That pork cutlet looks delicious.

1243
00:40:51,925 --> 00:40:53,093
(Will Ji Hyo give in to the pork cutlet too?)

1244
00:40:53,094 --> 00:40:55,439
I want the pork cutlet so much.

1245
00:40:55,465 --> 00:40:56,593
I choose ramyeon.

1246
00:40:56,594 --> 00:40:57,739
(Ramyeon costs 2 dollars.)

1247
00:40:58,135 --> 00:41:00,270
(Jae Seok is frustrated too.)

1248
00:41:00,335 --> 00:41:01,803
I love ramyeon, but this pork cutlet looks...

1249
00:41:01,804 --> 00:41:03,363
I'll choose one of these two.

1250
00:41:03,364 --> 00:41:04,933
(My team's victory or my satisfaction,)

1251
00:41:04,934 --> 00:41:06,580
(that's the question.)

1252
00:41:06,605 --> 00:41:08,643
I choose this.

1253
00:41:08,644 --> 00:41:09,980
(Kwang Soo, Se Chan, Jong Kook, and So Min make up their minds.)

1254
00:41:10,074 --> 00:41:11,319
This is insane.

1255
00:41:11,414 --> 00:41:12,890
If we're going to fail anyway,

1256
00:41:13,875 --> 00:41:15,160
should I at least eat?

1257
00:41:17,914 --> 00:41:19,413
This is driving me crazy.

1258
00:41:19,414 --> 00:41:20,683
(He can't resist the 10-dollar crab.)

1259
00:41:20,684 --> 00:41:21,854
It looks so fresh.

1260
00:41:21,855 --> 00:41:24,029
(He can't resist the 10-dollar crab.)

1261
00:41:24,324 --> 00:41:25,930
Should I just eat this and not look at the bulletin board?

1262
00:41:28,364 --> 00:41:29,964
(I've made up my mind.)

1263
00:41:29,965 --> 00:41:32,739
(Seok Jin chooses the 10-dollar soy sauce marinated crab.)

1264
00:41:33,864 --> 00:41:35,109
For my team...

1265
00:41:35,204 --> 00:41:36,803
- Did you make the right choice? - Did you not betray us, right?

1266
00:41:36,804 --> 00:41:40,980
Let me announce the result of the second mission, Food My Way.

1267
00:41:41,105 --> 00:41:43,073
It can't go over 50 dollars.

1268
00:41:43,074 --> 00:41:45,044
If it does, I won't just sit back.

1269
00:41:45,045 --> 00:41:47,013
- I'll find the culprit. - It can't.

1270
00:41:47,014 --> 00:41:48,489
I want the hotteoks.

1271
00:41:48,784 --> 00:41:50,919
I'll tell you who chose which dish.

1272
00:41:51,014 --> 00:41:53,290
Haha chose...

1273
00:41:53,385 --> 00:41:54,854
a seven-dollar pork cutlet meal.

1274
00:41:54,855 --> 00:41:56,154
(Haha chose a 7-dollar pork cutlet meal.)

1275
00:41:56,155 --> 00:41:57,283
I knew it.

1276
00:41:57,284 --> 00:41:58,993
I told you that I will pick pork cutlet.

1277
00:41:58,994 --> 00:42:00,100
I knew Haha would do that.

1278
00:42:00,324 --> 00:42:02,163
Didn't you say you will pick ramyeon?

1279
00:42:02,164 --> 00:42:03,863
I told you that I will pick pork cutlet.

1280
00:42:03,864 --> 00:42:05,134
- Okay? - Let's hope...

1281
00:42:05,135 --> 00:42:06,609
- no one else picked pork cutlet. - Okay.

1282
00:42:07,094 --> 00:42:08,964
- I told you. - It will be over...

1283
00:42:08,965 --> 00:42:10,203
if someone else picked pork cutlet.

1284
00:42:10,204 --> 00:42:12,509
The menu Ji Hyo picked is...

1285
00:42:13,204 --> 00:42:15,303
- ramyeon that costs two dollars. - Good job.

1286
00:42:15,304 --> 00:42:17,143
I really wanted pork cutlet,

1287
00:42:17,144 --> 00:42:18,613
- but I picked ramyeon instead. - Okay.

1288
00:42:18,614 --> 00:42:20,314
- Jae Seok said he wants ramyeon. - Ramyeon.

1289
00:42:20,315 --> 00:42:22,243
- It has to be ramyeon. - He wouldn't have betrayed us.

1290
00:42:22,244 --> 00:42:23,444
It has to be ramyeon.

1291
00:42:23,445 --> 00:42:24,730
It has to be ramyeon no matter what.

1292
00:42:24,985 --> 00:42:26,830
Jae Seok picked ramyeon.

1293
00:42:26,855 --> 00:42:28,430
- Yes! - Jae Seok.

1294
00:42:29,125 --> 00:42:30,124
(When he picked the menu...)

1295
00:42:30,125 --> 00:42:31,299
Ramyeon.

1296
00:42:32,224 --> 00:42:33,969
My goodness.

1297
00:42:34,525 --> 00:42:37,223
- You are cool. - Did you see that, Ji Hyo?

1298
00:42:37,224 --> 00:42:39,410
(It's a heartwarming moment.)

1299
00:42:39,434 --> 00:42:40,810
- Did you see that? - Jae Seok.

1300
00:42:41,235 --> 00:42:42,540
Did you see that, Ji Hyo?

1301
00:42:42,965 --> 00:42:45,180
- It's Kwang Soo's turn. - If you didn't pick ramyeon...

1302
00:42:45,405 --> 00:42:47,009
I will end you if you didn't pick ramyeon.

1303
00:42:47,034 --> 00:42:48,274
Ramyeon.

1304
00:42:48,275 --> 00:42:50,580
(Kwang Soo picked ramyeon that costs 2 dollars.)

1305
00:42:51,074 --> 00:42:52,413
- Yes! - He's so cool.

1306
00:42:52,414 --> 00:42:54,013
I picked ramyeon. I picked ramyeon.

1307
00:42:54,014 --> 00:42:56,160
- What is up with you? - I picked ramyeon.

1308
00:42:56,244 --> 00:42:58,013
- What is up with you? - I picked ramyeon.

1309
00:42:58,014 --> 00:42:59,413
We will win if the rest of you picked ramyeon.

1310
00:42:59,414 --> 00:43:00,553
(The total cost could be under 30 dollars at this rate.)

1311
00:43:00,554 --> 00:43:02,524
- Se Chan picked... - Se Chan, you...

1312
00:43:02,525 --> 00:43:03,924
(Se Chan's choice)

1313
00:43:03,925 --> 00:43:05,100
ramyeon.

1314
00:43:05,894 --> 00:43:07,100
Ramyeon.

1315
00:43:07,525 --> 00:43:09,424
- We did it. We will succeed. - We did it.

1316
00:43:09,425 --> 00:43:11,263
- We did it. - We will succeed no matter what.

1317
00:43:11,264 --> 00:43:13,270
- Three people remain. - This is how it should be.

1318
00:43:13,364 --> 00:43:14,634
This is beautiful.

1319
00:43:14,635 --> 00:43:18,040
- This is beautiful. - Seok Jin is turning pale.

1320
00:43:18,135 --> 00:43:20,310
- No, no. - Seok Jin picked...

1321
00:43:21,644 --> 00:43:23,473
I will end Seok Jin if he picked a course meal.

1322
00:43:23,474 --> 00:43:24,819
(Jae Seok has no idea.)

1323
00:43:25,945 --> 00:43:27,073
Soy sauce marinated crab?

1324
00:43:27,074 --> 00:43:28,643
A 10-dollar soy sauce marinated crab.

1325
00:43:28,644 --> 00:43:30,419
(Seok Jin chose a 10-dollar soy sauce marinated crab.)

1326
00:43:31,085 --> 00:43:33,053
What is his problem?

1327
00:43:33,054 --> 00:43:35,230
(It ruins the heartwarming moment of unity.)

1328
00:43:36,125 --> 00:43:37,154
(The total cost is 25 dollars.)

1329
00:43:37,155 --> 00:43:38,600
Are you serious?

1330
00:43:40,054 --> 00:43:41,254
Jong Kook chose...

1331
00:43:41,255 --> 00:43:42,323
(Jong Kook and So Min remain.)

1332
00:43:42,324 --> 00:43:43,870
a three-dollar tteokbokki.

1333
00:43:44,494 --> 00:43:45,839
We did it.

1334
00:43:45,864 --> 00:43:47,870
(From the vehicle, he said he will have tteokbokki.)

1335
00:43:47,965 --> 00:43:50,263
I choose this.

1336
00:43:50,264 --> 00:43:51,404
(He picked tteokbokki without wavering.)

1337
00:43:51,405 --> 00:43:52,973
(The total cost is 28 dollars.)

1338
00:43:52,974 --> 00:43:54,580
What did So Min choose?

1339
00:43:54,945 --> 00:43:56,044
What did you choose?

1340
00:43:56,045 --> 00:43:58,113
So Min's menu will decide...

1341
00:43:58,114 --> 00:43:59,674
- You will be shocked. - What did you choose?

1342
00:43:59,675 --> 00:44:00,714
It's up to So Min's decision.

1343
00:44:00,715 --> 00:44:02,113
- So Min. - You will be shocked.

1344
00:44:02,114 --> 00:44:04,259
Praise me.

1345
00:44:04,914 --> 00:44:06,584
- So Min chose... - You will be shocked.

1346
00:44:06,585 --> 00:44:08,013
You will be in tears.

1347
00:44:08,014 --> 00:44:10,660
(What did So Min choose?)

1348
00:44:12,155 --> 00:44:15,469
A 50-cent boiled egg.

1349
00:44:15,925 --> 00:44:20,640
(Praise So Min.)

1350
00:44:22,135 --> 00:44:25,149
If I choose tteokbokki, it will go over by a dollar.

1351
00:44:25,275 --> 00:44:27,279
Then I have to choose a boiled egg.

1352
00:44:27,574 --> 00:44:29,250
To gain the team members' trust,

1353
00:44:29,304 --> 00:44:31,174
I will choose a boiled egg.

1354
00:44:31,175 --> 00:44:32,913
(The icon of trust and sacrifice, So Min)

1355
00:44:32,914 --> 00:44:35,283
We would have failed, had you chosen ramyeon.

1356
00:44:35,284 --> 00:44:37,283
- So Min! So Min! - Seriously.

1357
00:44:37,284 --> 00:44:39,029
So Min! I can't believe it.

1358
00:44:39,414 --> 00:44:40,584
This is the best.

1359
00:44:40,585 --> 00:44:42,460
- I... - So Min, are you on a diet?

1360
00:44:42,784 --> 00:44:44,953
We should celebrate without Seok Jin.

1361
00:44:44,954 --> 00:44:46,569
- Hey. - Seriously.

1362
00:44:46,954 --> 00:44:50,569
(He has soy sauce marinated crab, but he has no comradeship.)

1363
00:44:51,195 --> 00:44:52,464
In any case,

1364
00:44:52,465 --> 00:44:53,964
I chose something that is just right since I know you guys.

1365
00:44:53,965 --> 00:44:56,239
Thank goodness So Min is on a diet...

1366
00:44:56,764 --> 00:44:58,033
for her new drama.

1367
00:44:58,034 --> 00:45:00,933
- This is incredible. - Exempt me from the Yondu makeup.

1368
00:45:00,934 --> 00:45:02,944
- You deserve that. - My goodness.

1369
00:45:02,945 --> 00:45:05,573
It seems like Seok Jin will wear...

1370
00:45:05,574 --> 00:45:07,214
- the Yondu makeup. - He took another step towards it.

1371
00:45:07,215 --> 00:45:08,560
Yondu.

1372
00:45:09,344 --> 00:45:12,683
Thus, you will get the menu you ordered.

1373
00:45:12,684 --> 00:45:13,884
(They will get lunch and ice cream hotteoks.)

1374
00:45:13,885 --> 00:45:17,000
- We succeeded in the mission. - You will get ice cream hotteoks.

1375
00:45:17,925 --> 00:45:19,569
This is a good day.

1376
00:45:19,824 --> 00:45:23,069
I will have tteokbokki, fritters, and hotteok.

1377
00:45:23,195 --> 00:45:25,439
The pork cutlet looks amazing.

1378
00:45:25,465 --> 00:45:26,993
It looks delicious.

1379
00:45:26,994 --> 00:45:28,533
(The menu shows self-love!)

1380
00:45:28,534 --> 00:45:30,134
(Eating)

1381
00:45:30,135 --> 00:45:31,339
Is it good?

1382
00:45:32,804 --> 00:45:33,933
Here is water.

1383
00:45:33,934 --> 00:45:35,950
(This pork cutlet tastes amazing!)

1384
00:45:38,005 --> 00:45:39,719
(Jae Seok eats ramyeon.)

1385
00:45:39,844 --> 00:45:42,183
Please remember that you are having lunch...

1386
00:45:42,184 --> 00:45:44,189
- because I chose a boiled egg. - That's right.

1387
00:45:44,315 --> 00:45:45,613
Ice cream hotteoks are here.

1388
00:45:45,614 --> 00:45:47,084
(Ice cream hotteoks are here.)

1389
00:45:47,085 --> 00:45:49,223
Are these the ice cream hotteok?

1390
00:45:49,224 --> 00:45:51,794
There is ice cream inside a hotteok.

1391
00:45:51,795 --> 00:45:53,053
(It looks delicious.)

1392
00:45:53,054 --> 00:45:54,169
It's delicious.

1393
00:45:54,394 --> 00:45:55,663
- It's delicious. - Right?

1394
00:45:55,664 --> 00:45:57,093
It tastes like a waffle.

1395
00:45:57,094 --> 00:45:58,609
It's really tasty.

1396
00:45:59,465 --> 00:46:01,363
Since you succeeded in the mission,

1397
00:46:01,364 --> 00:46:04,910
you will play Candy Dilemma, a game that can get you more candies.

1398
00:46:05,005 --> 00:46:07,834
Write down a number from 1 to 10 in secret...

1399
00:46:07,835 --> 00:46:09,819
and turn it in.

1400
00:46:09,974 --> 00:46:11,203
Excluding the overlapping numbers,

1401
00:46:11,204 --> 00:46:13,843
the person who wrote down the highest number...

1402
00:46:13,844 --> 00:46:15,814
will get the same number of candies.

1403
00:46:15,815 --> 00:46:18,020
You need to get the highest number that doesn't overlap.

1404
00:46:18,255 --> 00:46:20,254
The highest number no one else chose.

1405
00:46:20,255 --> 00:46:21,359
This is insane.

1406
00:46:21,454 --> 00:46:22,930
What should I do?

1407
00:46:23,085 --> 00:46:26,799
A lot of people will choose the two-digit number, right?

1408
00:46:26,954 --> 00:46:29,924
Seven would be a good choice.

1409
00:46:29,925 --> 00:46:32,009
Seven, my foot. Stop playing tricks.

1410
00:46:33,135 --> 00:46:35,263
Don't trust anything that comes out...

1411
00:46:35,264 --> 00:46:36,564
of that treacherous mouth.

1412
00:46:36,565 --> 00:46:38,703
- Seriously. - That treacherous mouth...

1413
00:46:38,704 --> 00:46:41,374
- "That treacherous mouth"? - Stop playing tricks.

1414
00:46:41,375 --> 00:46:42,719
I ate ramyeon!

1415
00:46:43,275 --> 00:46:45,274
Don't live that way.

1416
00:46:45,275 --> 00:46:47,689
What are you talking about? I ate ramyeon.

1417
00:46:47,775 --> 00:46:49,113
I wrote down a number with confidence.

1418
00:46:49,114 --> 00:46:50,544
- Me too. - I will turn it in.

1419
00:46:50,545 --> 00:46:52,053
We can't choose 10 now. Jae Seok chose 10.

1420
00:46:52,054 --> 00:46:53,053
(Who will get candies?)

1421
00:46:53,054 --> 00:46:54,529
Maybe no one chose 10.

1422
00:46:54,925 --> 00:46:56,084
- I will turn it in. - I will turn it in.

1423
00:46:56,085 --> 00:46:57,899
Come on. You can trust me.

1424
00:46:58,994 --> 00:47:00,430
- Put it in. - So Min, give it to me.

1425
00:47:00,525 --> 00:47:02,924
Why can't you trust me? Why are you putting your guards up?

1426
00:47:02,925 --> 00:47:04,723
I was afraid you would see it.

1427
00:47:04,724 --> 00:47:05,794
Why would I see it?

1428
00:47:05,795 --> 00:47:09,239
He will trust you when he loves you.

1429
00:47:10,135 --> 00:47:11,439
Don't you love me yet?

1430
00:47:13,204 --> 00:47:14,944
- Don't be ridiculous. - When will you love me?

1431
00:47:14,945 --> 00:47:16,350
Give me some time.

1432
00:47:16,574 --> 00:47:18,020
Give me some time.

1433
00:47:18,175 --> 00:47:19,274
So Min.

1434
00:47:19,275 --> 00:47:21,214
- I will announce the result. - Okay.

1435
00:47:21,215 --> 00:47:22,343
(The result of Candy Dilemma)

1436
00:47:22,344 --> 00:47:24,544
People who chose 10...

1437
00:47:24,545 --> 00:47:25,783
I guess many people chose 10.

1438
00:47:25,784 --> 00:47:26,913
How many people chose 10?

1439
00:47:26,914 --> 00:47:28,654
Se Chan, Jae Seok, and Ji Hyo.

1440
00:47:28,655 --> 00:47:30,723
(Se Chan, Jae Seok, and Ji Hyo are out.)

1441
00:47:30,724 --> 00:47:32,053
Three people are out.

1442
00:47:32,054 --> 00:47:34,200
Then there is a member who wrote down the lowest number.

1443
00:47:34,965 --> 00:47:36,694
So Min wrote down four.

1444
00:47:36,695 --> 00:47:38,163
(So Min is out.)

1445
00:47:38,164 --> 00:47:39,564
I don't think So Min will be able to eat.

1446
00:47:39,565 --> 00:47:41,933
One person wrote seven.

1447
00:47:41,934 --> 00:47:43,104
It's Kwang Soo.

1448
00:47:43,105 --> 00:47:44,339
(Kwang Soo chose 7!)

1449
00:47:44,364 --> 00:47:46,104
(He is a strong candidate.)

1450
00:47:46,105 --> 00:47:47,879
Among the remaining three members,

1451
00:47:48,605 --> 00:47:49,980
eight was written down...

1452
00:47:50,744 --> 00:47:53,243
(If all 3 of them wrote down the same number, Kwang Soo wins.)

1453
00:47:53,244 --> 00:47:54,473
by Haha and Seok Jin.

1454
00:47:54,474 --> 00:47:56,714
(Haha and Seok Jin are out!)

1455
00:47:56,715 --> 00:47:59,484
- Did I win? - Jong Kook wrote down nine.

1456
00:47:59,485 --> 00:48:02,524
- Did I win with 9? - Jong Kook wrote down 9.

1457
00:48:02,525 --> 00:48:04,160
That means Kwang Soo failed.

1458
00:48:04,885 --> 00:48:05,993
Did he fail?

1459
00:48:05,994 --> 00:48:07,354
- What? - Good job.

1460
00:48:07,355 --> 00:48:08,524
(Disappointed)

1461
00:48:08,525 --> 00:48:11,493
I changed the number from 8 to 9 at the last minute.

1462
00:48:11,494 --> 00:48:14,064
- You will get nine candies. - Are you serious?

1463
00:48:14,065 --> 00:48:16,263
- You could share them. - I won't do that. Give them to me.

1464
00:48:16,264 --> 00:48:18,004
(I won't do that. Give them to me.)

1465
00:48:18,005 --> 00:48:20,274
(He is greedy for candies.)

1466
00:48:20,275 --> 00:48:21,774
- Please give me one. - No, no.

1467
00:48:21,775 --> 00:48:22,774
I will give one to Ji Hyo.

1468
00:48:22,775 --> 00:48:24,319
- Jong Kook. - Why?

1469
00:48:24,344 --> 00:48:25,743
- Why would you do that? - Why?

1470
00:48:25,744 --> 00:48:27,044
I handed in a lot of candies too.

1471
00:48:27,045 --> 00:48:28,743
I will give one to Ji Hyo and Haha.

1472
00:48:28,744 --> 00:48:30,214
- I need candies too. - What about me?

1473
00:48:30,215 --> 00:48:31,343
Please give me one.

1474
00:48:31,344 --> 00:48:32,854
What about me, Jong Kook?

1475
00:48:32,855 --> 00:48:34,830
Don't speak nonsense. Be quiet.

1476
00:48:35,025 --> 00:48:38,330
(Why are you so mean to me?)

1477
00:48:38,355 --> 00:48:40,254
I chose ramyeon.

1478
00:48:40,255 --> 00:48:41,964
I used seven candies as I promised!

1479
00:48:41,965 --> 00:48:43,194
Sit down.

1480
00:48:43,195 --> 00:48:44,339
I mean...

1481
00:48:44,594 --> 00:48:46,310
- Thank you. - Please give me one.

1482
00:48:46,394 --> 00:48:48,163
- I used seven candies. - Jong Kook.

1483
00:48:48,164 --> 00:48:49,433
Jong Kook, give me one.

1484
00:48:49,434 --> 00:48:50,433
(Haha gets 1 candy!)

1485
00:48:50,434 --> 00:48:52,049
(Thank goodness I didn't get caught.)

1486
00:48:52,235 --> 00:48:53,573
Thank you.

1487
00:48:53,574 --> 00:48:55,444
I spent four candies before.

1488
00:48:55,445 --> 00:48:57,803
- For now... - Please give me one.

1489
00:48:57,804 --> 00:48:58,973
Let's do this.

1490
00:48:58,974 --> 00:49:00,750
- I might end up placing last. - No.

1491
00:49:01,414 --> 00:49:02,683
So Min, you hurt my feelings.

1492
00:49:02,684 --> 00:49:04,944
You chose to sit next to Se Chan instead of me.

1493
00:49:04,945 --> 00:49:06,154
It's not like that.

1494
00:49:06,155 --> 00:49:07,553
I want to check some photos with him.

1495
00:49:07,554 --> 00:49:08,783
I doubt that.

1496
00:49:08,784 --> 00:49:10,553
- Just now? - She never leaves Se Chan's side.

1497
00:49:10,554 --> 00:49:11,654
It's not like that.

1498
00:49:11,655 --> 00:49:14,600
You are just a nice man...

1499
00:49:15,094 --> 00:49:16,669
while Se Chan is the man she loves.

1500
00:49:17,465 --> 00:49:19,363
Se Chan is the man she loves.

1501
00:49:19,364 --> 00:49:20,834
- Let me see it. - It's a nice photo.

1502
00:49:20,835 --> 00:49:22,640
It looks like a photo they took at an airport...

1503
00:49:22,864 --> 00:49:24,104
on their way to honeymoon.

1504
00:49:24,105 --> 00:49:25,433
I didn't know I was smiling like that.

1505
00:49:25,434 --> 00:49:26,473
They look like newlyweds.

1506
00:49:26,474 --> 00:49:28,843
It looks like a photo they took at an airport.

1507
00:49:28,844 --> 00:49:31,104
- "You're My Sunshine!" - "You're My Sunshine!"

1508
00:49:31,105 --> 00:49:32,589
I didn't know I was smiling like that.

1509
00:49:33,945 --> 00:49:37,390
(They sing the OST of "You're My Sunshine!")

1510
00:49:37,945 --> 00:49:39,384
Se Chan!

1511
00:49:39,385 --> 00:49:41,754
- She's mimicking Jeon Do Yeon. - Se Chan!

1512
00:49:41,755 --> 00:49:43,183
Se Chan!

1513
00:49:43,184 --> 00:49:44,730
I learned that tone from Se Chan.

1514
00:49:44,784 --> 00:49:46,200
Se Chan!

1515
00:49:46,394 --> 00:49:47,799
Se Chan!

1516
00:49:48,425 --> 00:49:49,899
I am exhausted, So Min.

1517
00:49:50,965 --> 00:49:52,939
Se Chan said he is exhausted with a smile on his face.

1518
00:49:53,695 --> 00:49:54,939
"I am exhausted."

1519
00:49:55,135 --> 00:49:56,580
What was that?

1520
00:49:56,934 --> 00:50:00,174
(When did I do that?)

1521
00:50:00,175 --> 00:50:01,174
(He looked so cheerful.)

1522
00:50:01,175 --> 00:50:03,580
- Stop it. Stop it. - "I am exhausted."

1523
00:50:04,644 --> 00:50:06,049
(Ji Hyo bursts out laughing.)

1524
00:50:07,474 --> 00:50:09,884
I haven't heard that kind of laughter from Ji Hyo in a while.

1525
00:50:09,885 --> 00:50:10,984
Ji Hyo.

1526
00:50:10,985 --> 00:50:12,754
That was an honest laugh.

1527
00:50:12,755 --> 00:50:15,084
- I burst out laughing. - That's right.

1528
00:50:15,085 --> 00:50:16,183
Ji Hyo.

1529
00:50:16,184 --> 00:50:18,399
I burst out laughing.

1530
00:50:20,525 --> 00:50:22,564
Gosh, I love this kind of snack.

1531
00:50:22,565 --> 00:50:23,593
(They arrive at the location of the third mission.)

1532
00:50:23,594 --> 00:50:25,093
- I love this kind of snack. - What is this?

1533
00:50:25,094 --> 00:50:26,663
I love this kind of snack.

1534
00:50:26,664 --> 00:50:28,433
- It's a healthy snack. - It contains fruits.

1535
00:50:28,434 --> 00:50:29,803
It's a healthy snack.

1536
00:50:29,804 --> 00:50:33,334
(There are fruits inside chewy rice cake.)

1537
00:50:33,335 --> 00:50:35,944
(Sweet and refreshing fruit rice cake)

1538
00:50:35,945 --> 00:50:37,120
I want the one with strawberries.

1539
00:50:37,204 --> 00:50:38,814
- I want the one with strawberries. - Me too.

1540
00:50:38,815 --> 00:50:39,973
I love this kind of snack.

1541
00:50:39,974 --> 00:50:41,613
Something funny happened...

1542
00:50:41,614 --> 00:50:43,660
in the vehicle.

1543
00:50:43,715 --> 00:50:46,560
Mi Yeon, the writer,

1544
00:50:46,585 --> 00:50:48,924
stumbled when the vehicle came to a sudden halt.

1545
00:50:48,925 --> 00:50:50,899
Seok Jin spoke like a senior university student.

1546
00:50:51,485 --> 00:50:53,169
"Mi Yeon, don't hurt yourself."

1547
00:50:53,255 --> 00:50:54,629
(My goodness.)

1548
00:50:55,195 --> 00:50:57,770
(Stumbling)

1549
00:50:58,394 --> 00:50:59,893
(He almost hurt himself.)

1550
00:50:59,894 --> 00:51:01,163
"Don't hurt yourself."

1551
00:51:01,164 --> 00:51:02,810
(Flailing)

1552
00:51:03,364 --> 00:51:04,810
He almost hurt himself badly.

1553
00:51:05,405 --> 00:51:07,504
He almost fell off the vehicle.

1554
00:51:07,505 --> 00:51:09,104
He could have just said,

1555
00:51:09,105 --> 00:51:11,419
"Mi Yeon, are you okay? Be careful."

1556
00:51:11,474 --> 00:51:13,319
"Mi Yeon, don't hurt yourself."

1557
00:51:14,315 --> 00:51:17,243
(He embarrassed himself.)

1558
00:51:17,244 --> 00:51:19,790
The third mission in which you could win...

1559
00:51:20,155 --> 00:51:21,613
fruit rice cakes is...

1560
00:51:21,614 --> 00:51:23,124
Categories, Answer Me.

1561
00:51:23,125 --> 00:51:24,399
- Categories, Answer Me. - Categories, Answer Me.

1562
00:51:24,425 --> 00:51:25,870
(What could it be?)

1563
00:51:26,525 --> 00:51:28,024
When I give you a category,

1564
00:51:28,025 --> 00:51:29,624
everyone must say a fitting answer that doesn't overlap...

1565
00:51:29,625 --> 00:51:31,424
in eight seconds in order to succeed.

1566
00:51:31,425 --> 00:51:33,893
(Everyone must say a fitting answer that doesn't overlap in 8 seconds.)

1567
00:51:33,894 --> 00:51:36,464
Jae Seok isn't good at games.

1568
00:51:36,465 --> 00:51:37,663
I am good at this kind of game.

1569
00:51:37,664 --> 00:51:40,009
We just need to succeed once, right?

1570
00:51:40,034 --> 00:51:43,004
There will be three rounds. 8 members must answer in 8 seconds.

1571
00:51:43,005 --> 00:51:45,274
- Let's go. - Each member has a second.

1572
00:51:45,275 --> 00:51:47,489
Let's go. Categories, Answer Me.

1573
00:51:47,545 --> 00:51:49,214
Set, go.

1574
00:51:49,215 --> 00:51:51,189
Movies with aliens in them.

1575
00:51:52,581 --> 00:51:53,314
..., go.

1576
00:51:53,315 --> 00:51:55,289
Movies with aliens in them.

1577
00:51:55,639 --> 00:51:56,678
"Alien".

1578
00:51:56,679 --> 00:51:57,883
"Armageddon".

1579
00:51:57,884 --> 00:51:59,013
- Six, - "Aliens".

1580
00:51:59,014 --> 00:52:00,024
- five, - "Independence Day".

1581
00:52:00,025 --> 00:52:01,053
- four, - "Men in Black".

1582
00:52:01,054 --> 00:52:02,323
- "Mars Attacks!". - "E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial".

1583
00:52:02,324 --> 00:52:03,600
- One. - "Men in Black II".

1584
00:52:04,225 --> 00:52:06,039
(They fail Round 1.)

1585
00:52:06,324 --> 00:52:08,269
There are no aliens in "Armageddon."

1586
00:52:08,594 --> 00:52:10,033
Who said "Armageddon"?

1587
00:52:10,034 --> 00:52:11,493
(They all turn their heads.)

1588
00:52:11,494 --> 00:52:13,533
- There are no aliens in it. - Why did you do that one?

1589
00:52:13,534 --> 00:52:16,434
They just go to Mars in "Armageddon." They go abroad.

1590
00:52:16,435 --> 00:52:19,180
(They just go to Mars in "Armageddon." They go abroad.)

1591
00:52:19,744 --> 00:52:20,743
(They go abroad?)

1592
00:52:20,744 --> 00:52:22,890
- They go abroad? - No, I mean...

1593
00:52:23,114 --> 00:52:24,414
What are you talking about?

1594
00:52:24,415 --> 00:52:26,113
Bruce Willis stars in it.

1595
00:52:26,114 --> 00:52:27,883
- They leave to protect Earth. - They're in space.

1596
00:52:27,884 --> 00:52:30,314
They prevent an asteroid from colliding into Earth.

1597
00:52:30,315 --> 00:52:31,814
- I know. - A comet.

1598
00:52:31,815 --> 00:52:34,423
There might be aliens in "Armageddon" if you look carefully.

1599
00:52:34,424 --> 00:52:36,053
- No, there aren't. - No?

1600
00:52:36,054 --> 00:52:38,524
There was a movie where Kwang Soo was a fish. Is that also an alien?

1601
00:52:38,525 --> 00:52:40,763
It's a fish person. How's that an alien?

1602
00:52:40,764 --> 00:52:42,300
(It's a fish person!)

1603
00:52:42,795 --> 00:52:44,334
- What is it then? - It's not an alien.

1604
00:52:44,335 --> 00:52:46,504
- It's a mutant. - On "Tazza: One-Eyed Jacks,"

1605
00:52:46,505 --> 00:52:48,863
- aren't you an alien? - Why am I an alien?

1606
00:52:48,864 --> 00:52:50,550
(He's enraged.)

1607
00:52:50,574 --> 00:52:53,080
- Because of your butt. - Your butt was too droopy.

1608
00:52:53,205 --> 00:52:54,403
Your butt.

1609
00:52:54,404 --> 00:52:56,013
You had no butt.

1610
00:52:56,014 --> 00:52:57,743
I was not an alien.

1611
00:52:57,744 --> 00:52:59,113
My character was called Cho Kka Chi.

1612
00:52:59,114 --> 00:53:01,819
(It sounds like he's cursing.)

1613
00:53:02,645 --> 00:53:04,414
- No? - My bad.

1614
00:53:04,415 --> 00:53:05,914
I see.

1615
00:53:05,915 --> 00:53:08,184
Dooly's grandfather is in my related search.

1616
00:53:08,185 --> 00:53:09,524
(He's known for having a flat butt.)

1617
00:53:09,525 --> 00:53:10,524
- Seriously? - Yes.

1618
00:53:10,525 --> 00:53:13,339
Haha said he looked like Dooly's grandfather.

1619
00:53:13,924 --> 00:53:15,394
This is an easy question. You have three chances left.

1620
00:53:15,395 --> 00:53:16,934
- Good luck. Keep it going. - Let's do this.

1621
00:53:16,935 --> 00:53:18,394
- Let's do it this time. - Let's go.

1622
00:53:18,395 --> 00:53:19,640
Should I go to the end?

1623
00:53:19,935 --> 00:53:22,379
- I think that's better. - Should we do that?

1624
00:53:22,435 --> 00:53:24,204
Let's do that. Move over.

1625
00:53:24,205 --> 00:53:26,080
- I'll stay in the middle. - Okay.

1626
00:53:26,574 --> 00:53:28,850
- This is good. - You're going to be in the middle?

1627
00:53:29,205 --> 00:53:30,613
Leave the easy ones.

1628
00:53:30,614 --> 00:53:32,743
- The peaks are too high here. - Stop pretending like you're good.

1629
00:53:32,744 --> 00:53:34,383
(This is the Himalayas of quizzes. Nobody can reach the top.)

1630
00:53:34,384 --> 00:53:36,689
I'm the leader here.

1631
00:53:37,815 --> 00:53:40,100
- Why me? - I'll be quick.

1632
00:53:40,125 --> 00:53:41,153
Let's do this.

1633
00:53:41,154 --> 00:53:42,153
Should we start? What should we do?

1634
00:53:42,154 --> 00:53:43,423
- Yes, start with Jae Seok. - Okay.

1635
00:53:43,424 --> 00:53:44,524
- Let's do this. - Okay.

1636
00:53:44,525 --> 00:53:46,740
- Good luck! - Good luck!

1637
00:53:47,025 --> 00:53:48,294
- Let's go. - Give us slightly easier ones.

1638
00:53:48,295 --> 00:53:52,593
Let's go. Categories, Answer Me, start.

1639
00:53:52,594 --> 00:53:55,403
Words with ssang giyeok in them. Eight,

1640
00:53:55,404 --> 00:53:56,910

1646
00:54:04,815 --> 00:54:06,419
What was that?

1647
00:54:06,545 --> 00:54:07,644
What was that about?

1648
00:54:07,645 --> 00:54:08,914
Haha.

1649
00:54:08,915 --> 00:54:10,053
- I did it. - What was that?

1650
00:54:10,054 --> 00:54:11,613
- Are you out of your mind? - I did it.

1651
00:54:11,614 --> 00:54:12,854
What was that about?

1652
00:54:12,855 --> 00:54:15,883
Did you see four of them standing up at once?

1653
00:54:15,884 --> 00:54:17,923
They all stood up to kill one person.

1654
00:54:17,924 --> 00:54:19,640
That startled me.

1655
00:54:19,665 --> 00:54:21,323
(As soon as the bell rang,)

1656
00:54:21,324 --> 00:54:24,064
(all 4 of them stood at once.)

1657
00:54:24,065 --> 00:54:26,680
(He was intimidated.)

1658
00:54:27,165 --> 00:54:28,604
I don't even remember.

1659
00:54:28,605 --> 00:54:29,903
I don't remember. What did I say?

1660
00:54:29,904 --> 00:54:30,934
- There are so many words. - What did I say?

1661
00:54:30,935 --> 00:54:32,403
- What was that? - What did I say?

1662
00:54:32,404 --> 00:54:34,149
- Tangerine? Was that it? - What was that?

1663
00:54:34,404 --> 00:54:36,319
- There's honey water. - Cockle.

1664
00:54:36,415 --> 00:54:38,213
Let's keep going.

1665
00:54:38,214 --> 00:54:39,843
Be quick.

1666
00:54:39,844 --> 00:54:41,713
We have to speak fast.

1667
00:54:41,714 --> 00:54:44,283
I answer as soon as Chul Min asks me.

1668
00:54:44,284 --> 00:54:46,700
I answer right away. It's back and forth.

1669
00:54:47,225 --> 00:54:48,999
- There goes the emperor of ad-lib. - Move. Start.

1670
00:54:49,025 --> 00:54:50,100
Here we go.

Korean people in history. Eight...

1673

1679
00:55:05,875 --> 00:55:07,644
- Sejong the Great! - Jae Seok!

1680
00:55:07,645 --> 00:55:09,749
Four people took mine!

1681
00:55:10,315 --> 00:55:12,673
- Four people took mine! - Think!

1682
00:55:12,674 --> 00:55:16,013
I was going to do Yi Sun Shin then I thought of Toi Gye Yi Hwang.

1683
00:55:16,014 --> 00:55:18,613
Then what was I supposed to do?

1684
00:55:18,614 --> 00:55:20,124
- You can't do this to me. - There were more.

1685
00:55:20,125 --> 00:55:22,283
The last person is important. It's hard.

1686
00:55:22,284 --> 00:55:23,524
- It's hard. I know. - You get stuck.

1687
00:55:23,525 --> 00:55:25,693
This is your last chance. Where do you want to start?

1688
00:55:25,694 --> 00:55:27,370
Please give us an easy one.

1689
00:55:27,424 --> 00:55:28,923
- This side. - That side is better.

1690
00:55:28,924 --> 00:55:30,334

00:55:37,005 --> 00:55:38,249
- What did you say? - seven...

1695
00:55:38,475 --> 00:55:40,374
- Hurry up. Anybody. - He didn't understand. Start over.

00:55:40,375 --> 00:55:42,303
- Sorry. - Foreign musicians.

1697
00:55:42,304 --> 00:55:43,713
- Start with him. - 8, 7...

1698
00:55:43,714 --> 00:55:44,874

(Beethoven, Mozart...)

1703
00:55:52,284 --> 00:55:53,923
- Ji Hyo has got nothing. - Goodness.

1704
00:55:53,924 --> 00:55:55,584
(They run out of time in the last round.)

1705
00:55:55,585 --> 00:55:57,153
Ji Hyo.

1706
00:55:57,154 --> 00:55:59,124

(Confidently)

1710
00:56:03,864 --> 00:56:05,334
What was that?

1711
00:56:05,335 --> 00:56:06,963
Sonata?

1712
00:56:06,964 --> 00:56:09,080
Somebody's going to say Beyer.

1713
00:56:09,505 --> 00:56:10,803
- What? - Are you serious?

1714
00:56:10,804 --> 00:56:12,104
(Something tells me I'm wrong.)

1715
00:56:12,105 --> 00:56:13,874
I was thinking of Michael Jackson.

1716
00:56:13,875 --> 00:56:16,044
It's foreign musician, so doesn't Michael Jackson work?

1717
00:56:16,045 --> 00:56:18,213
- I panicked. - You can do him.

1718
00:56:18,214 --> 00:56:20,113
I thought I had to say a hard one.

1719
00:56:20,114 --> 00:56:22,713
It's not hard. Beethoven is not hard, you punk!

1720
00:56:22,714 --> 00:56:25,359
(Beethoven is not hard, you punk!)

1721
00:56:26,725 --> 00:56:27,724
(He's furious.)

1722
00:56:27,725 --> 00:56:29,323
Fine.

1723
00:56:29,324 --> 00:56:31,653
- I know. - You need to understand.

1724
00:56:31,654 --> 00:56:34,300
- Thug. - One last chance.

1725
00:56:34,324 --> 00:56:37,863
If one person gives up their candy, then I'll give you another chance.

1726
00:56:37,864 --> 00:56:39,493
- Give up yours. - Who should it be?

1727
00:56:39,494 --> 00:56:40,633
- Seriously. - Jae Seok.

1728
00:56:40,634 --> 00:56:43,510
You answered 1 in 7 seconds.

1729

1730

00:56:48,105 --> 00:56:50,113
There are too many games within games.

Let's try one more time.

1734
00:56:51,315 --> 00:56:53,144

00:57:00,924 --> 00:57:02,729
(7, 8.)

1740
00:57:03,525 --> 00:57:05,800
(What did he say?)

1741
00:57:06,025 --> 00:57:08,593
That was a clean loss, Seok Jin.

1742
00:57:08,594 --> 00:57:10,470
They have great teamwork.

1743
00:57:10,864 --> 00:57:13,133
- My goodness. - This is back and forth.

1744
00:57:13,134 --> 00:57:14,604
(It's him again.)

1745
00:57:14,605 --> 00:57:16,133
7, 8.

1746
00:57:16,134 --> 00:57:19,249
Running Man members have great teamwork.

1747
00:57:19,304 --> 00:57:22,580
- I don't have too many left. - 7, 8.

1748
00:57:22,804 --> 00:57:27,314
Categories, Answer Me, start.

1749
00:57:27,315 --> 00:57:30,530
Mixed-gender bands. 8, 7,

1750
00:57:30,855 --> 00:57:32,653
6, 5,

1751
00:57:32,654 --> 00:57:33,883
- COOL. - four,

1752
00:57:33,884 --> 00:57:35,124
- three, - Time out.

1753
00:57:35,125 --> 00:57:36,854
- two... - Pause.

1754
00:57:36,855 --> 00:57:39,224
You timed out at five seconds.

1755
00:57:39,225 --> 00:57:40,593
- Time out. - Just do whatever.

1756
00:57:40,594 --> 00:57:43,164
- Just do whatever. - You have to start off.

1757
00:57:43,165 --> 00:57:44,263
- Every second matters. - Again.

1758
00:57:44,264 --> 00:57:46,310
We timed out at five seconds.

1759
00:57:46,335 --> 00:57:48,664
- I did COOL, right? - He took three seconds.

1760
00:57:48,665 --> 00:57:51,633
- You can finish in 5 seconds. - Go fast.

1761
00:57:51,634 --> 00:57:52,774
Let's go.

1762
00:57:52,775 --> 00:57:54,573
- Ready, - I'm going to do COOL.

1763
00:57:54,574 --> 00:57:56,743
- set, go. - Got it.

1764
00:57:56,744 --> 00:57:57,743
- COOL. - Roo'Ra.

1765
00:57:57,744 --> 00:57:59,144
- Space A. - I was going to do...

1766
00:57:59,145 --> 00:58:00,814
- What? - Goodness.

1767
00:58:00,815 --> 00:58:02,113
- Space A. - I was going to do...

1768
00:58:02,114 --> 00:58:03,883
- What? - 2, 1.

1769
00:58:03,884 --> 00:58:05,383
I was going to do Space A.

1770
00:58:05,384 --> 00:58:07,823
- I told you to do Roo'Ra. - I said I was going to do it.

1771
00:58:07,824 --> 00:58:09,484
I was going to do Space A.

1772
00:58:09,485 --> 00:58:11,423
I was thinking of Space A the whole time.

1773
00:58:11,424 --> 00:58:13,524
This is what I told him. What was it?

1774
00:58:13,525 --> 00:58:15,993
UP, COOL, Roo'Ra, Space A.

1775
00:58:15,994 --> 00:58:17,334
That's what we were going to do.

1776
00:58:17,335 --> 00:58:18,894
- Space A. - Hold on.

1777
00:58:18,895 --> 00:58:21,234
You failed Categories, Answer Me.

1778
00:58:21,235 --> 00:58:22,310
(They fail Categories, Answer Me.)

1779
00:58:22,435 --> 00:58:25,834
There are still chances to earn more candies.

1780
00:58:25,835 --> 00:58:27,979
If you're within the range, we'll double your candies.

1781
00:58:28,304 --> 00:58:30,213
I'm in last place.

1782
00:58:30,214 --> 00:58:33,490
Here's the range for the number of candies.

1783
00:58:33,784 --> 00:58:36,954
19 to 29.

1784
00:58:36,955 --> 00:58:39,390
(Range: 19 to 29 candies)

1785
00:58:40,125 --> 00:58:41,300
It's unchanged.

1786
00:58:41,585 --> 00:58:44,153
Please hand in the candies one at a time.

1787
00:58:44,154 --> 00:58:45,693
We can go over.

1788
00:58:45,694 --> 00:58:47,024
That's my concern.

1789
00:58:47,025 --> 00:58:48,863
Se Chan didn't give up any earlier.

1790
00:58:48,864 --> 00:58:49,894
He didn't.

1791
00:58:49,895 --> 00:58:52,394
I did hand in some. I really did.

1792
00:58:52,395 --> 00:58:54,709
- Are you going to hand in 6? - I'll give up everything I have. 6.

1793
00:58:54,935 --> 00:58:56,080
Go, Se Chan.

1794
00:58:56,534 --> 00:58:57,979
I'll hand in five.

1795
00:58:58,034 --> 00:58:59,950
- That's a lot. - I'll hand in three.

1796
00:59:01,275 --> 00:59:02,879
(He's careful.)

1797
00:59:03,775 --> 00:59:06,144
Six.

1798
00:59:06,145 --> 00:59:08,459
(He gives up everything he has.)

1799
00:59:08,844 --> 00:59:10,490
(Their candies get doubled if they fall within the range.)

1800
00:59:10,685 --> 00:59:12,283
Did you do it? Six?

1801
00:59:12,284 --> 00:59:14,430
- Are you sure? - You handed in six?

1802
00:59:15,884 --> 00:59:18,854
This is giving me a headache. I'm going to hand in 11.

1803
00:59:18,855 --> 00:59:20,124
- What? - I'm going to hand in 11.

1804
00:59:20,125 --> 00:59:22,024
- Really? We're going to go over. - You don't have too many left.

1805
00:59:22,025 --> 00:59:23,394
- I don't think we'll go over. - We will.

1806
00:59:23,395 --> 00:59:26,370
I'm going to do three. Ji Hyo gave up some too.

1807
00:59:26,835 --> 00:59:28,303
This is going to go over.

1808
00:59:28,304 --> 00:59:30,334
It won't, Haha. It won't go over.

1809
00:59:30,335 --> 00:59:31,550
How many did you give up?

1810
00:59:31,574 --> 00:59:33,819
I can't tell you, but I gave a lot.

1811
00:59:34,674 --> 00:59:36,743
Hold on.

1812
00:59:36,744 --> 00:59:38,689
I just got goosebumps.

1813
00:59:38,915 --> 00:59:43,213
Didn't Haha say he gave up his candies earlier?

1814
00:59:43,214 --> 00:59:44,213
He did.

1815
00:59:44,214 --> 00:59:45,213
- Right? - Yes.

1816
00:59:45,214 --> 00:59:47,684
- So you gave him some. - So I gave him one.

1817
00:59:47,685 --> 00:59:48,930
That's true.

1818
00:59:49,485 --> 00:59:51,423
Why do you have 11 then?

1819
00:59:51,424 --> 00:59:53,300
(Why do you have 11 then?)

1820
00:59:53,864 --> 00:59:55,524
- That's not true. - Hey.

1821
00:59:55,525 --> 00:59:56,934
- I said too much. - Attention.

1822
00:59:56,935 --> 00:59:58,133
- Are you serious? - I have it.

1823
00:59:58,134 --> 00:59:59,133
I got goosebumps.

1824
00:59:59,134 --> 01:00:01,339
- Did he betray you? - Jong Kook.

1825
01:00:01,435 --> 01:00:04,204
- He didn't give up any earlier. - He didn't.

1826
01:00:04,205 --> 01:00:05,374
It was me.

1827
01:00:05,375 --> 01:00:06,673
What are you talking about? It was me.

1828
01:00:06,674 --> 01:00:08,280
I swear it was me.

1829
01:00:08,904 --> 01:00:11,213
Jong Kook, you trust Haha too much.

1830
01:00:11,214 --> 01:00:13,089
He more than betrayed you.

1831
01:00:13,815 --> 01:00:15,589
This is mind-blowing.

1832
01:00:15,714 --> 01:00:19,189
He said he was going to hand in 11. He couldn't have 11.

1833
01:00:20,424 --> 01:00:21,584
He took mine.

1834
01:00:21,585 --> 01:00:22,923
Trust me.

1835
01:00:22,924 --> 01:00:24,493
- My gosh. - This is insane.

1836
01:00:24,494 --> 01:00:27,140
- I got goosebumps. - It'll soon be over.

1837
01:00:27,424 --> 01:00:29,224
- Unbelievable. - I do it.

1838
01:00:29,225 --> 01:00:30,434
(It's Kwang Soo's turn.)

1839
01:00:30,435 --> 01:00:32,370
We won't go over this time.

1840
01:00:32,494 --> 01:00:33,504
(He's serious.)

1841
01:00:33,505 --> 01:00:35,504
Jong Kook handed in three.

1842
01:00:35,505 --> 01:00:37,204
(The result might change depending on what Kwang Soo does.)

1843
01:00:37,205 --> 01:00:40,419
I'm not good at this kind of stuff.

1844
01:00:41,005 --> 01:00:42,803
Don't hand in any, Kwang Soo.

1845
01:00:42,804 --> 01:00:46,959
- Don't hand in any. - Just live like you always have.

1846
01:00:47,415 --> 01:00:49,513
Don't hand in any candies.

1847
01:00:49,514 --> 01:00:50,584
(What will be Kwang Soo's choice?)

1848
01:00:50,585 --> 01:00:51,729
Kwang Soo.

1849
01:00:52,085 --> 01:00:53,923
You won't hand in any candies.

1850
01:00:53,924 --> 01:00:56,030
- You need to avoid placing last. - Seriously.

1851
01:00:57,025 --> 01:00:59,470
(0 candies)

1852
01:00:59,895 --> 01:01:01,600
(Did he hand in candies?)

1853
01:01:02,165 --> 01:01:03,934
- Stop it. - Come here.

1854
01:01:03,935 --> 01:01:05,209
(Everyone handed in candies!)

1855
01:01:05,464 --> 01:01:09,879
(What is the total number of candies?)

1856
01:01:09,935 --> 01:01:12,004
All right. I will give you the number.

1857
01:01:12,005 --> 01:01:13,474
- Okay. Did we go over? - I am curious.

1858
01:01:13,475 --> 01:01:16,479
The range is between 19 and 29.

1859
01:01:16,944 --> 01:01:19,149
The number of candies you handed in is...

1860
01:01:19,915 --> 01:01:22,184
(If the number is within the range,)

1861
01:01:22,185 --> 01:01:25,530
(everyone will get twice the candies they handed in.)

1862
01:01:26,085 --> 01:01:28,783
- 28. - We did it.

1863
01:01:28,784 --> 01:01:31,254
(The number is within the range.)

1864
01:01:31,255 --> 01:01:32,923
Is it within the range?

1865
01:01:32,924 --> 01:01:34,399
- What does it mean? - It's within the range.

1866
01:01:34,565 --> 01:01:35,993
- Will everyone eat? - We are safe.

1867
01:01:35,994 --> 01:01:37,093
Will everyone eat?

1868
01:01:37,094 --> 01:01:39,039
(Everyone gets twice the candies they handed in.)

1869
01:01:39,165 --> 01:01:40,664
(So Min gets 6, Ji Ho gets 8,)

1870
01:01:40,665 --> 01:01:42,033
(Haha gets 8,)

1871
01:01:42,034 --> 01:01:43,834
(Jong Kook gets 6,)

1872
01:01:43,835 --> 01:01:45,803
(Seok Jin gets 10, Jae Seok gets 6,)

1873
01:01:45,804 --> 01:01:46,943
(and Se Chan gets 12.)

1874
01:01:46,944 --> 01:01:50,713
(The current number of candies)

1875
01:01:50,714 --> 01:01:52,990
(Kwang Soo places last with 10 candies.)

1876
01:01:53,545 --> 01:01:54,819
I got goosebumps.

1877
01:01:55,214 --> 01:01:56,613
I would like to remind you that...

1878
01:01:56,614 --> 01:01:58,113
only those of you who handed in candies...

1879
01:01:58,114 --> 01:01:59,883
- will get twice... - Did someone not hand in candies?

1880
01:01:59,884 --> 01:02:02,129
- the amount. - Someone didn't hand in candies.

1881
01:02:02,985 --> 01:02:05,069
I thought a lot about whether I should hand in one more.

1882
01:02:05,255 --> 01:02:08,269
Everyone looks happy, but Kwang Soo looks sad.

1883
01:02:09,065 --> 01:02:11,033
(He can't hide his sadness.)

1884
01:02:11,034 --> 01:02:12,463
- Look at Kwang Soo's face. - Are you okay?

1885
01:02:12,464 --> 01:02:14,510
I am set now.

1886
01:02:15,165 --> 01:02:16,533
- I am rich now. - Is that so?

1887
01:02:16,534 --> 01:02:17,803
Sure.

1888
01:02:17,804 --> 01:02:21,403
We will move on to the last round.

1889
01:02:21,404 --> 01:02:25,120
(With Kwang Soo feeling sad, they move on to the last round.)

1890
01:02:26,944 --> 01:02:28,843
- Honey butter sweet potato. - What is that?

1891
01:02:28,844 --> 01:02:29,990
(Honey butter sweet potatoes await them.)

1892
01:02:30,685 --> 01:02:32,613
- Gosh, they look delicious. - What are these?

1893
01:02:32,614 --> 01:02:35,124
(Sweet honey and soft butter inside sweet potatoes)

1894
01:02:35,125 --> 01:02:36,600
Sweet potatoes.

1895
01:02:36,725 --> 01:02:39,024
- They smell amazing. - Sweet potatoes, butter, and honey.

1896
01:02:39,025 --> 01:02:40,700
- So Min. - Don't put your nose in them.

1897
01:02:41,864 --> 01:02:43,863
(Did she put her nose in them?)

1898
01:02:43,864 --> 01:02:45,363
- So Min. - Don't put your nose in them.

1899
01:02:45,364 --> 01:02:46,803
They smell so nice.

1900
01:02:46,804 --> 01:02:48,234
My nose didn't touch them.

1901
01:02:48,235 --> 01:02:49,979
It's okay even if it did. We are a family.

1902
01:02:51,105 --> 01:02:52,274
He is generous.

1903
01:02:52,275 --> 01:02:54,720
Jong Kook, do you like So Min?

1904
01:02:56,444 --> 01:02:59,050
(Do you like So Min?)

1905
01:02:59,275 --> 01:03:00,484
Sometimes...

1906
01:03:00,485 --> 01:03:01,660
(Does he like me as well?)

1907
01:03:02,315 --> 01:03:03,914
(He feels sad for some reason.)

1908
01:03:03,915 --> 01:03:05,260
I feel uncomfortable.

1909
01:03:05,654 --> 01:03:09,153
Jong Kook, do you like me?

1910
01:03:09,154 --> 01:03:11,093
(She shows off her charms.)

1911
01:03:11,094 --> 01:03:12,153
- Come on. - You need a beating...

1912
01:03:12,154 --> 01:03:13,499
to come to your senses.

1913
01:03:14,295 --> 01:03:16,600
(Scared)

1914
01:03:17,464 --> 01:03:20,604
It's time for the final mission to acquire the upgraded version...

1915
01:03:20,605 --> 01:03:23,204
of a famous winter snack, honey butter sweet potatoes.

1916
01:03:23,205 --> 01:03:24,403
- The final mission. - Sweet potatoes.

1917
01:03:24,404 --> 01:03:26,573
Don't Cross the Line.

1918
01:03:26,574 --> 01:03:28,550
- Don't Cross the Line? - What is that?

1919
01:03:28,944 --> 01:03:30,414
(What is that?)

1920
01:03:30,415 --> 01:03:32,274
It's what you see at the beach.

1921
01:03:32,275 --> 01:03:34,443
- You throw a coin. - You win prizes that way.

1922
01:03:34,444 --> 01:03:35,720
I know this game.

1923
01:03:35,844 --> 01:03:39,184
Each member will throw an R coin on a panel with squares...

1924
01:03:39,185 --> 01:03:40,783
ranging from 50 cents to 10 dollars.

1925
01:03:40,784 --> 01:03:43,954
If the total amount in 2 rounds is 25 dollars or greater,

1926
01:03:43,955 --> 01:03:45,024
the mission is a success.

1927
01:03:45,025 --> 01:03:46,993
The R coin needs to land within the boundary.

1928
01:03:46,994 --> 01:03:49,939
If it lands on the line, you fail to win money.

1929
01:03:50,065 --> 01:03:52,794
The lines are quite thick.

1930
01:03:52,795 --> 01:03:55,104
There aren't many 10-dollar squares.

1931
01:03:55,105 --> 01:03:57,979
You can hit and push each other's coin.

1932
01:03:58,105 --> 01:04:00,319
We will get started when you say, "Here I go."

1933
01:04:00,375 --> 01:04:01,774
- I will go first. Here I go. - Let's go.

1934
01:04:01,775 --> 01:04:02,803
(Jong Kook goes first!)

1935
01:04:02,804 --> 01:04:04,974
This is hard. It will be hard to get the 10-dollar squares.

1936
01:04:04,975 --> 01:04:06,120
(The 10-dollar squares are smaller.)

1937
01:04:06,915 --> 01:04:08,414
(Jong Kook lowers his body...)

1938
01:04:08,415 --> 01:04:10,060
(and throws the coin.)

1939
01:04:10,154 --> 01:04:11,390
There you go.

1940
01:04:13,725 --> 01:04:15,224
(The coin slides.)

1941
01:04:15,225 --> 01:04:16,560
- Two dollars. - Okay.

1942
01:04:18,125 --> 01:04:19,930
(He wins 2 dollars right away!)

1943
01:04:20,065 --> 01:04:22,024
We are off to a good start.

1944
01:04:22,025 --> 01:04:23,200
We are...

1945
01:04:23,565 --> 01:04:24,934
- What? - We are off to a good start.

1946
01:04:24,935 --> 01:04:26,394
We are off to a good start, are we?

1947
01:04:26,395 --> 01:04:27,640
Good job.

1948
01:04:28,335 --> 01:04:30,580
I will hold your hand. Lean forward.

1949
01:04:31,304 --> 01:04:32,580
It will be fine as long as your feet stay in.

1950
01:04:32,634 --> 01:04:34,673
- Okay. There you go. - There you go.

1951
01:04:34,674 --> 01:04:36,974
- Let's go a bit further. - A bit further.

1952
01:04:36,975 --> 01:04:38,843
This is cool. We look really cool right now.

1953
01:04:38,844 --> 01:04:40,390
(Are you sure about that?)

1954
01:04:40,985 --> 01:04:42,383
(Approaching)

1955
01:04:42,384 --> 01:04:43,584
Pull. I will lean forward.

1956
01:04:43,585 --> 01:04:44,914
- This is good. - Pull harder.

1957
01:04:44,915 --> 01:04:48,100
Hey, So Min is watching.

1958
01:04:49,154 --> 01:04:51,930
(Knowing that So Min is watching makes him falter.)

1959
01:04:52,255 --> 01:04:53,939
(What is up with him?)

1960
01:04:54,194 --> 01:04:55,669
Do I look okay?

1961
01:04:56,094 --> 01:04:57,363
Seriously.

1962
01:04:57,364 --> 01:04:58,970
So Min's facial expression is so oily.

1963
01:04:59,395 --> 01:05:01,209
(I will cheer for Se Chan.)

1964
01:05:01,304 --> 01:05:03,379
(Their position is set!)

1965
01:05:03,534 --> 01:05:04,879
You look like a hero right now.

1966
01:05:04,935 --> 01:05:06,310
Let me go a bit further.

1967
01:05:06,435 --> 01:05:08,019
(He carefully throws the coin like a hero!)

1968
01:05:08,605 --> 01:05:09,843
So Min is watching.

1969
01:05:09,844 --> 01:05:11,843
(Se Chan has So Min's support.)

1970
01:05:11,844 --> 01:05:13,390
(What will be the result?)

1971
01:05:18,514 --> 01:05:20,999
(The coin lands on a 10-dollar square!)

1972
01:05:21,525 --> 01:05:23,669
(He succeeded to acquire 10 dollars.)

1973
01:05:27,565 --> 01:05:29,863
(Everyone is excited.)

1974
01:05:29,864 --> 01:05:30,863
(The total becomes 12 dollars in 2 turns.)

1975
01:05:30,864 --> 01:05:32,209
Let's do this.

1976
01:05:32,764 --> 01:05:34,410
We won't get this kind of chance again.

1977
01:05:35,034 --> 01:05:36,510
- You looked so cool. - Really?

1978
01:05:37,475 --> 01:05:39,979
- That was amazing. - I would like to remind you that...

1979
01:05:40,005 --> 01:05:42,550
the member in last place won't get a chance...

1980
01:05:42,904 --> 01:05:45,350
to win more candies if this mission ends successfully.

1981
01:05:45,574 --> 01:05:48,213
You won't get a chance to hand in candies.

1982
01:05:48,214 --> 01:05:50,330
Let me explain. If this mission ends successfully,

1983
01:05:50,815 --> 01:05:54,053
we won't get to bet our candies.

1984
01:05:54,054 --> 01:05:55,499
- The rankings will stay the same. - We won't hand in candies.

1985
01:05:55,525 --> 01:05:57,093
The rankings will stay the same.

1986
01:05:57,094 --> 01:05:58,300
We still need to succeed in this mission.

1987
01:05:58,855 --> 01:06:01,164
What is it, Kwang Soo?

1988
01:06:01,165 --> 01:06:03,363
- But... - It's worrisome even if we succeed.

1989
01:06:03,364 --> 01:06:05,693
The person in last place should be careful.

1990
01:06:05,694 --> 01:06:06,839
Okay.

1991
01:06:07,404 --> 01:06:08,879
Just be careful not to hit the coin on the 10-dollar square.

1992
01:06:09,235 --> 01:06:11,209
(Kwang Soo made up his mind to do something evil.)

1993
01:06:11,875 --> 01:06:13,649
(It's Haha's turn.)

1994
01:06:14,674 --> 01:06:16,343
(Throwing)

1995
01:06:16,344 --> 01:06:18,019
(50 cents)

1996
01:06:18,344 --> 01:06:19,974
(I could have gotten 10 dollars.)

1997
01:06:19,975 --> 01:06:21,220
At least we got 50 cents.

1998
01:06:21,244 --> 01:06:23,684
- It suits you. - 50 cents suit you.

1999
01:06:23,685 --> 01:06:26,030
No coins are on the lines.

2000
01:06:26,114 --> 01:06:27,300
Everyone did a good job.

2001
01:06:27,485 --> 01:06:29,800
- No coins are on the lines. - Everyone did a good job.

2002
01:06:29,824 --> 01:06:31,224
We have 12.50 dollars.

2003
01:06:31,225 --> 01:06:36,524
Hold on. Kwang Soo is practicing to hit the coins.

2004
01:06:36,525 --> 01:06:37,633
That's not true.

2005
01:06:37,634 --> 01:06:38,769
(Earlier)

2006
01:06:39,395 --> 01:06:40,763
(His eyes are on the coin on the 10-dollar square.)

2007
01:06:40,764 --> 01:06:43,539
(He wants to hit the coin.)

2008
01:06:43,835 --> 01:06:45,274
That's not true.

2009
01:06:45,275 --> 01:06:47,274
I was trying out new methods.

2010
01:06:47,275 --> 01:06:48,374
(He becomes wary of Kwang Soo.)

2011
01:06:48,375 --> 01:06:50,050
Let's see what Kwang Soo does.

2012
01:06:51,074 --> 01:06:52,289
Ji Hyo.

2013
01:06:52,775 --> 01:06:53,783
(Kwang Soo gives her a lift.)

2014
01:06:53,784 --> 01:06:54,990
Make sure your feet stay behind.

2015
01:06:55,514 --> 01:06:56,984
- Make sure your feet stay behind. - This is a good idea.

2016
01:06:56,985 --> 01:06:58,454
You can do it. It looks promising.

2017
01:06:58,455 --> 01:07:00,359
- This is a good form. - This is a good idea.

2018
01:07:00,625 --> 01:07:01,923
Make sure your feet stay behind. I will hold your feet.

2019
01:07:01,924 --> 01:07:03,923
This is the best. She will get 10 dollars for sure.

2020
01:07:03,924 --> 01:07:05,053
There you go.

2021
01:07:05,054 --> 01:07:06,499
- Ji Hyo. - Throw lightly.

2022
01:07:06,694 --> 01:07:08,423
(Ji Hyo is ready.)

2023
01:07:08,424 --> 01:07:09,493
Ji Hyo, get 10 dollars.

2024
01:07:09,494 --> 01:07:11,410
(She just needs to throw the coin lightly.)

2025
01:07:11,494 --> 01:07:13,963
(Will the airplane method succeed?)

2026
01:07:13,964 --> 01:07:15,580
(Lifting)

2027
01:07:17,235 --> 01:07:19,533
(Kwang Soo lifts Ji Hyo up.)

2028
01:07:19,534 --> 01:07:22,004
(He did it as Ji Hyo threw the coin.)

2029
01:07:22,005 --> 01:07:23,573
(What will be the result of his action?)

2030
01:07:23,574 --> 01:07:24,644
- Do it lightly. - Come on.

2031
01:07:24,645 --> 01:07:25,990
That was close.

2032
01:07:26,674 --> 01:07:28,783
(She could have gotten 3 dollars.)

2033
01:07:28,784 --> 01:07:30,689
Her aim was nice.

2034
01:07:30,784 --> 01:07:33,229
(She didn't add more money.)

2035
01:07:33,284 --> 01:07:35,084
(My goodness.)

2036
01:07:35,085 --> 01:07:36,930
- Her aim was nice. - What?

2037
01:07:37,154 --> 01:07:38,693
Why did you kick?

2038
01:07:38,694 --> 01:07:40,593
(Why did you kick in the end?)

2039
01:07:40,594 --> 01:07:42,039
(He got caught.)

2040
01:07:42,125 --> 01:07:44,669
(Did he kick?)

2041
01:07:44,764 --> 01:07:45,794
Three dollars.

2042
01:07:45,795 --> 01:07:47,064
Go for a three-dollar square.

2043
01:07:47,065 --> 01:07:48,133
Stop worrying and throw.

2044
01:07:48,134 --> 01:07:49,439
(Throwing)

2045
01:07:49,964 --> 01:07:52,479
(It lands on a line.)

2046
01:07:52,634 --> 01:07:54,604
(The total is still 12.50 dollars.)

2047
01:07:54,605 --> 01:07:56,080
- I missed. - It's on a line.

2048
01:07:57,574 --> 01:07:59,343
- This is hard. - 1 dollar or 1.50 dollars.

2049
01:07:59,344 --> 01:08:01,084
(Jae Seok throws.)

2050
01:08:01,085 --> 01:08:03,359
- Gosh, I missed. - Did you miss?

2051
01:08:03,815 --> 01:08:05,314
(Jae Seok fails.)

2052
01:08:05,315 --> 01:08:06,954
(Thank goodness.)

2053
01:08:06,955 --> 01:08:08,053
So Min.

2054
01:08:08,054 --> 01:08:09,260
- That's good. - There you go.

2055
01:08:10,525 --> 01:08:11,653
I wish it had gone a bit further.

2056
01:08:11,654 --> 01:08:12,854
- I was close. - She really looked like a frog.

2057
01:08:12,855 --> 01:08:16,493
(They have 12.50 dollars left to go.)

2058
01:08:16,494 --> 01:08:18,664
- I haven't gone yet. - Do you want me to lift you up?

2059
01:08:18,665 --> 01:08:19,839
Yes.

2060
01:08:19,935 --> 01:08:21,104
- Do you? - Yes.

2061
01:08:21,105 --> 01:08:23,564
- Wait. He might do something weird. - No, I won't.

2062
01:08:23,565 --> 01:08:24,633
Haha.

2063
01:08:24,634 --> 01:08:26,133
- Haha. - He can get...

2064
01:08:26,134 --> 01:08:27,320
Haha.

2065
01:08:28,504 --> 01:08:30,279
- He can get the 10-dollar square. - Haha.

2066
01:08:30,615 --> 01:08:32,913
(The squares are really close to Kwang Soo.)

2067
01:08:32,914 --> 01:08:35,583
(With 10 candies, Kwang Soo is likely to receive a penalty.)

2068
01:08:35,584 --> 01:08:37,953
(If the mission ends successfully, he won't get to move up the ranks.)

2069
01:08:37,954 --> 01:08:40,724
(The coin on the 10-dollar square is the biggest obstacle.)

2070
01:08:40,725 --> 01:08:42,824
(I need to hit that coin on the 10-dollar square.)

2071
01:08:42,825 --> 01:08:45,093
(Dropping)

2072
01:08:45,094 --> 01:08:46,724
(He drops the coin.)

2073
01:08:46,725 --> 01:08:47,994
Hey! Hold on. He dropped it.

2074
01:08:47,995 --> 01:08:49,100
He dropped it.

2075
01:08:49,195 --> 01:08:50,763
(Nerves make him lose his grip.)

2076
01:08:50,764 --> 01:08:53,169
(I need to hit that coin!)

2077
01:08:53,294 --> 01:08:54,709
He is acting strange.

2078
01:08:54,935 --> 01:08:56,163
- He is acting strange, right? - No, no.

2079
01:08:56,164 --> 01:08:57,850
Why did you aim for this square?

2080
01:08:58,035 --> 01:08:59,850
(Throwing)

2081
01:09:01,804 --> 01:09:04,474
(Let me hit that coin.)

2082
01:09:04,475 --> 01:09:06,774
(I hope this mission fails.)

2083
01:09:06,775 --> 01:09:08,184
(The 1st round ends with a total of 12.50 dollars.)

2084
01:09:08,185 --> 01:09:10,060
- See? - He is acting strange.

2085
01:09:10,914 --> 01:09:15,329
(JI Hyo, Jong Kook, Se Chan, and Kwang Soo won 2.50 dollars.)

2086
01:09:15,525 --> 01:09:16,753
(It's So Min's turn.)

2087
01:09:16,754 --> 01:09:20,724
I am sorry, but would you help her with her form?

2088
01:09:20,725 --> 01:09:23,224
(Would you help your girlfriend with her form?)

2089
01:09:23,225 --> 01:09:25,034
I don't think she knows what she is doing.

2090
01:09:25,035 --> 01:09:26,110
Hold my hand.

2091
01:09:26,535 --> 01:09:27,879
- Hold my hand. - Okay.

2092
01:09:29,105 --> 01:09:31,104
(The two married men are excited for their sake.)

2093
01:09:31,105 --> 01:09:32,350
Hold my hand.

2094
01:09:32,374 --> 01:09:33,633
(Romantic)

2095
01:09:33,634 --> 01:09:34,843
Hold my hand well, you little...

2096
01:09:34,844 --> 01:09:38,274
(Hold my hand well, you little...)

2097
01:09:38,275 --> 01:09:39,444
(Her words are as wild as her love.)

2098
01:09:39,445 --> 01:09:40,959
- Se Chan won't let go. - No, I won't.

2099
01:09:40,985 --> 01:09:43,020
Let me support your weight. There you go.

2100
01:09:43,785 --> 01:09:45,583
- There you go. - The power of love!

2101
01:09:45,584 --> 01:09:46,659
(Throwing)

2102
01:09:47,924 --> 01:09:49,923
The power of love!

2103
01:09:49,924 --> 01:09:51,753
(She got 1.50 dollars.)

2104
01:09:51,754 --> 01:09:53,123
- 1.50 dollars. - 1.50 dollars. Good job.

2105
01:09:53,124 --> 01:09:54,263
(They need to get 8.50 dollars.)

2106
01:09:54,264 --> 01:09:55,999
- Why are you sweating so much? - It's hot in here.

2107
01:09:56,995 --> 01:09:59,364
- It's over if we get 10 dollars. - It's over if we get 10 dollars.

2108
01:09:59,365 --> 01:10:00,739
- How many of us haven't gone yet? - I haven't gone yet.

2109
01:10:00,935 --> 01:10:02,440
- Haha. - I really hope we succeed.

2110
01:10:02,464 --> 01:10:04,633
You never know what will happen in a variety show.

2111
01:10:04,634 --> 01:10:05,709
Why don't you sit down more?

2112
01:10:07,275 --> 01:10:09,303
(His tone isn't polite.)

2113
01:10:09,304 --> 01:10:10,644
(Despite being 10 years younger, Jong Kook uses a casual tone.)

2114
01:10:10,645 --> 01:10:12,474
- Why should I do that? - You are standing up too much.

2115
01:10:12,475 --> 01:10:14,419
It's okay. Just throw the coin.

2116
01:10:15,615 --> 01:10:17,260
- Gosh, that won't do. - 1.50 dollars.

2117
01:10:17,355 --> 01:10:18,484
It's okay.

2118
01:10:18,485 --> 01:10:20,524
We are closer to our goal.

2119
01:10:20,525 --> 01:10:22,459
- It's time to get 10 dollars. - 10 dollars.

2120
01:10:22,655 --> 01:10:23,800
Haha, let's do this.

2121
01:10:24,124 --> 01:10:25,300
Throw it.

2122
01:10:25,594 --> 01:10:28,163
(They succeed if Haha's coin lands on a 10-dollar square.)

2123
01:10:28,164 --> 01:10:30,894
(Will Haha be able to finish the mission?)

2124
01:10:30,895 --> 01:10:32,669
(He throws the coin!)

2125
01:10:33,634 --> 01:10:34,904
(Haha throws the coin...)

2126
01:10:34,905 --> 01:10:37,934
(and it rolls towards the 10-dollar square!)

2127
01:10:37,935 --> 01:10:40,879
(Will it land on a 10-dollar square?)

2128
01:10:41,605 --> 01:10:44,150
(It touches the line of a one-dollar square.)

2129
01:10:45,044 --> 01:10:46,913
(Haha fails to get money.)

2130
01:10:46,914 --> 01:10:48,944
- I thought he got it. - Me too.

2131
01:10:48,945 --> 01:10:50,383
- He passed by it. - That was close.

2132
01:10:50,384 --> 01:10:51,753
He touched the line.

2133
01:10:51,754 --> 01:10:54,484
- This is hard. - It's all on you.

2134
01:10:54,485 --> 01:10:56,724
You're an expert at these kinds of things.

2135
01:10:56,725 --> 01:10:59,154
You can do it. You will be a hero.

2136
01:10:59,155 --> 01:11:00,994
You always pull through in difficult circumstances.

2137
01:11:00,995 --> 01:11:02,140
(It's all up to Jae Seok!)

2138
01:11:02,924 --> 01:11:05,310
(As soon as he inserted, the pirate popped out.)

2139
01:11:05,735 --> 01:11:07,810
(He turns a crisis into an opportunity.)

2140
01:11:08,134 --> 01:11:09,934
(Whenever he threw darts,)

2141
01:11:09,935 --> 01:11:11,873
(he always hit the bullseye.)

2142
01:11:11,874 --> 01:11:14,644
(Jae Seok shines during the most difficult time.)

2143
01:11:14,645 --> 01:11:15,843
(Will he carry the team this time as well?)

2144
01:11:15,844 --> 01:11:18,390
Should I get closer?

2145
01:11:18,445 --> 01:11:20,119
Kwang Soo's plane is not bad.

2146
01:11:20,174 --> 01:11:23,013
- His airplane? - It's not bad.

2147
01:11:23,014 --> 01:11:25,354
You know, right? He's on the opposite side.

2148
01:11:25,355 --> 01:11:26,730
You don't know what he's going to do.

2149
01:11:26,815 --> 01:11:27,883
I won't let go.

2150
01:11:27,884 --> 01:11:29,360
(Trust me, Jae Seok.)

2151
01:11:30,155 --> 01:11:31,253
(Raising)

2152
01:11:31,254 --> 01:11:32,953
Hold on. You just raised me with your feet.

2153
01:11:32,954 --> 01:11:34,039
No, no.

2154
01:11:36,065 --> 01:11:37,963
(You just raised me with your feet.)

2155
01:11:37,964 --> 01:11:39,194
He raised his feet?

2156
01:11:39,195 --> 01:11:40,440
I was getting in the right position.

2157
01:11:40,664 --> 01:11:42,064
(Don't be mistaken.)

2158
01:11:42,065 --> 01:11:43,434
- Are you sure? - I was getting in position.

2159
01:11:43,435 --> 01:11:46,150
(He trusts Kwang Soo once more and leans his body.)

2160
01:11:46,174 --> 01:11:47,379
Go for 10 dollars.

2161
01:11:48,105 --> 01:11:49,673
(They make a plane,)

2162
01:11:49,674 --> 01:11:51,444
(and he tosses.)

2163
01:11:51,445 --> 01:11:53,314
(He tossed it.)

2164
01:11:53,315 --> 01:11:56,713
(They need 7 more dollars. If he gets 10, then they win.)

2165
01:11:56,714 --> 01:12:00,089
(If he fails, the mission is over. They won't have sweet potatoes.)

2166
01:12:00,214 --> 01:12:03,383
(What is the result?)

2167
01:12:03,384 --> 01:12:07,100
(The coin rolls toward 10 dollars.)

2168
01:12:07,264 --> 01:12:10,400
(Will miracles come true?)

2169
01:12:12,294 --> 01:12:13,593
(Cheering)

2170
01:12:13,594 --> 01:12:14,739
Wait.

2171
01:12:16,804 --> 01:12:18,873
(He landed on 10 dollars.)

2172
01:12:18,874 --> 01:12:20,803
(It touched the line though.)

2173
01:12:20,804 --> 01:12:22,274
It didn't touch the line.

2174
01:12:22,275 --> 01:12:23,474
- It did. - It didn't.

2175
01:12:23,475 --> 01:12:24,673
(They are 7 dollars short.)

2176
01:12:24,674 --> 01:12:26,074
- That was so close. - That was close.

2177
01:12:26,075 --> 01:12:28,114
- That was so close. - That really was.

2178
01:12:28,115 --> 01:12:31,383
You failed this round.

2179
01:12:31,384 --> 01:12:32,953
(Don't Cross the Line is a fail.)

2180
01:12:32,954 --> 01:12:34,824
You failed this round.

2181
01:12:34,825 --> 01:12:36,883
(Kwang Soo is relieved.)

2182
01:12:36,884 --> 01:12:38,894
(Candy Booth reopens for Kwang Soo to turn the game around.)

2183
01:12:38,895 --> 01:12:40,169
I almost had 10 dollars.

2184
01:12:40,195 --> 01:12:42,024
That was really close.

2185
01:12:42,025 --> 01:12:43,093
It was 1mm.

2186
01:12:43,094 --> 01:12:45,463
The range this time is...

2187
01:12:45,464 --> 01:12:47,803
(Range: 17 to 27)

2188
01:12:47,804 --> 01:12:53,110
17 to 27.

2189
01:12:53,204 --> 01:12:54,373
- 27? - It's less.

2190
01:12:54,374 --> 01:12:55,904
(Within range: win double, Outside of range: lose all)

2191
01:12:55,905 --> 01:12:57,919
They adjusted it.

2192
01:12:57,945 --> 01:13:00,043
If we bet 3 each, then it's 24.

2193
01:13:00,044 --> 01:13:02,513
The person who thinks they're in last place...

2194
01:13:02,514 --> 01:13:03,913
- will hand in everything. - Right.

2195
01:13:03,914 --> 01:13:05,354
That's how they can turn this around.

2196
01:13:05,355 --> 01:13:07,883
To stop that, we can't just bet less.

2197
01:13:07,884 --> 01:13:10,024
- We either bet nothing... - Or go over.

2198
01:13:10,025 --> 01:13:11,123
or go over.

2199
01:13:11,124 --> 01:13:13,499
We have to predict how many they have.

2200
01:13:13,964 --> 01:13:15,293
- Se Chan first. - Should I start?

2201
01:13:15,294 --> 01:13:16,793
(Se Chan goes first.)

2202
01:13:16,794 --> 01:13:19,793
I feel like I'm in first place.

2203
01:13:19,794 --> 01:13:21,133
(He has 18 candies in total.)

2204
01:13:21,134 --> 01:13:23,703
(Thinking)

2205
01:13:23,704 --> 01:13:25,150
(Current Number of Candies)

2206
01:13:26,374 --> 01:13:28,820
I'm not going to bet any.

2207
01:13:28,844 --> 01:13:30,350
- You're not going to bet? - Yes.

2208
01:13:30,615 --> 01:13:31,744
I'm betting none.

2209
01:13:31,745 --> 01:13:33,150
I have to win first place.

2210
01:13:33,914 --> 01:13:35,043
All right.

2211
01:13:35,044 --> 01:13:37,060
(He wants the penalty exemption, so he bets 0.)

2212
01:13:37,185 --> 01:13:38,730
Will we go over?

2213
01:13:38,914 --> 01:13:40,154
Will that happen?

2214
01:13:40,155 --> 01:13:41,724
This is complicated.

2215
01:13:41,725 --> 01:13:43,529
- Right? - I don't even know.

2216
01:13:44,825 --> 01:13:47,263
(Ji Hyo has 15 candies in total.)

2217
01:13:47,264 --> 01:13:48,669
I'll bet two.

2218
01:13:49,294 --> 01:13:51,633
(She bets 2.)

2219
01:13:51,634 --> 01:13:52,970
Is this the right choice?

2220
01:13:53,264 --> 01:13:56,110
I'll leave it up to fate. I'll keep 10,

2221
01:13:56,334 --> 01:13:58,409
and bet five.

2222
01:13:58,704 --> 01:13:59,833
I'll bet some.

2223
01:13:59,834 --> 01:14:03,043
(Jong Kook hands in 2 out of 19.)

2224
01:14:03,044 --> 01:14:04,320
Good work.

2225
01:14:04,844 --> 01:14:06,713
I won't bet too low or too high.

2226
01:14:06,714 --> 01:14:08,119
(Jae Seok hands in 3 out of 15.)

2227
01:14:08,344 --> 01:14:12,284
(Haha hands in 7 out of 19.)

2228
01:14:12,285 --> 01:14:14,684
(Current number of candies: 19)

2229
01:14:14,685 --> 01:14:15,854
I'll go.

2230
01:14:15,855 --> 01:14:17,154
(Seok Jin hands in 0 out of 15.)

2231
01:14:17,155 --> 01:14:21,270
(7 members made their bets.)

2232
01:14:22,195 --> 01:14:23,593
This is giving me a headache.

2233
01:14:23,594 --> 01:14:26,564
(Kwang Soo goes last.)

2234
01:14:26,565 --> 01:14:27,703
(Spilling)

2235
01:14:27,704 --> 01:14:29,463
Wait. This is giving me a headache.

2236
01:14:29,464 --> 01:14:31,474
I have 10. That's unchanged.

2237
01:14:31,475 --> 01:14:34,043
- 17 to 27? - Yes.

2238
01:14:34,044 --> 01:14:36,279
Let's say everybody bet 2 to 3 each.

2239
01:14:36,445 --> 01:14:38,614
16 to 27.

2240
01:14:38,615 --> 01:14:39,673
(If he bets 9, then they go over.)

2241
01:14:39,674 --> 01:14:42,413
I have to bet seven for sure. But if we go over...

2242
01:14:42,414 --> 01:14:43,814
(What will happen if we go over?)

2243
01:14:43,815 --> 01:14:45,829
Let me think about that scenario.

2244
01:14:46,454 --> 01:14:47,824
If we go over, I'm still last place.

2245
01:14:47,825 --> 01:14:49,284
(He realizes it quickly.)

2246
01:14:49,285 --> 01:14:51,053
I have to do this.

2247
01:14:51,054 --> 01:14:54,163
I have to get within the range.

2248
01:14:54,164 --> 01:14:55,923
So, what's the maximum I can bet?

2249
01:14:55,924 --> 01:14:57,633
(He has to get within the range, and win double.)

2250
01:14:57,634 --> 01:14:59,510
Wait. Three to start.

2251
01:14:59,895 --> 01:15:01,963
If I do all 10, then we'll go over.

2252
01:15:01,964 --> 01:15:04,234
(If I do all 10, then we'll go over.)

2253
01:15:04,235 --> 01:15:06,404
Did they bet or not?

2254
01:15:06,405 --> 01:15:09,543
(It depends on how many candies the members bet.)

2255
01:15:09,544 --> 01:15:10,720
Hold on.

2256
01:15:10,815 --> 01:15:13,713
I'm going to bet seven for sure.

2257
01:15:13,714 --> 01:15:14,713
(He bets 7.)

2258
01:15:14,714 --> 01:15:16,459
What should I do with these three?

2259
01:15:16,985 --> 01:15:18,459
This is driving me insane.

2260
01:15:18,554 --> 01:15:20,114
Should I bet just one more?

2261
01:15:20,115 --> 01:15:21,453
- Let me bet 1 more. That's 8. - Okay.

2262
01:15:21,454 --> 01:15:24,093
Never mind. We might go over by one.

2263
01:15:24,094 --> 01:15:26,453
We were within the range by one earlier.

2264
01:15:26,454 --> 01:15:29,339
Should I bet one more or not?

2265
01:15:29,365 --> 01:15:30,894
If they bet three each... No.

2266
01:15:30,895 --> 01:15:32,564
There's no way they would do that. One more.

2267
01:15:32,565 --> 01:15:33,633
I bet one more.

2268
01:15:33,634 --> 01:15:35,803
At eight, I will stop.

2269
01:15:35,804 --> 01:15:37,449
(Current number: 27)

2270
01:15:38,134 --> 01:15:40,409
- I bet 8. - Okay, I got 8.

2271
01:15:41,405 --> 01:15:43,480
(Pausing)

2272
01:15:44,044 --> 01:15:46,644
(If he bets one more, they go over.)

2273
01:15:46,645 --> 01:15:48,289
(He will be in last place.)

2274
01:15:48,514 --> 01:15:49,713
I will stop.

2275
01:15:49,714 --> 01:15:51,654
(He makes up his mind for the 3rd time)

2276
01:15:51,655 --> 01:15:53,430
(Stopping)

2277
01:15:53,954 --> 01:15:55,430
3 times 7 is 21.

2278
01:15:55,884 --> 01:15:57,854
Let me bet one more. This is the last time.

2279
01:15:57,855 --> 01:15:59,329
One more.

2280
01:15:59,895 --> 01:16:02,600
(Hesitating)

2281
01:16:04,164 --> 01:16:05,934
I hate this.

2282
01:16:05,935 --> 01:16:08,079
I don't want to be Yondu and sell fish-shaped buns.

2283
01:16:08,464 --> 01:16:09,864
I'm going crazy.

2284
01:16:09,865 --> 01:16:13,650
(He doesn't want the penalty. How many did he bet in the end?)

2285
01:16:14,275 --> 01:16:16,079
- He's back. - Is he back?

2286
01:16:16,174 --> 01:16:17,343
(Kwang Soo returns after betting his candies.)

2287
01:16:17,344 --> 01:16:20,074
- Why are you running back? - He has none left.

2288
01:16:20,075 --> 01:16:21,614
He went all-in.

2289
01:16:21,615 --> 01:16:23,890
He's all-in. I don't hear anything rustling.

2290
01:16:24,014 --> 01:16:25,190
No, I didn't.

2291
01:16:25,254 --> 01:16:26,489
Let's see how this ends.

2292
01:16:26,985 --> 01:16:28,760
The result is shocking.

2293
01:16:30,685 --> 01:16:31,900
(The total amount is shocking)

2294
01:16:31,924 --> 01:16:33,230
Really?

2295
01:16:33,754 --> 01:16:35,994
Kwang Soo must have won.

2296
01:16:35,995 --> 01:16:37,864
(Did Kwang Soo turn the game around?)

2297
01:16:37,865 --> 01:16:38,994
Oh, dear.

2298
01:16:38,995 --> 01:16:42,480
17 to 27 was the range.

2299
01:16:42,865 --> 01:16:44,474
The number of candies submitted is...

2300
01:16:44,475 --> 01:16:46,173
(Each person made their bets without telling each other.)

2301
01:16:46,174 --> 01:16:48,820
(If they fall within the range, they win double what they bet.)

2302
01:16:48,905 --> 01:16:51,249
(If they're out of the range, they lose what they bet.)

2303
01:16:51,275 --> 01:16:54,520
(Is the total between 17 to 27?)

2304
01:16:54,645 --> 01:16:55,959
28.

2305
01:16:56,384 --> 01:16:58,560
- Fail. - We went over.

2306
01:16:59,315 --> 01:17:00,854
(That's the total submitted.)

2307
01:17:00,855 --> 01:17:03,800
Fail. You failed by one.

2308
01:17:05,155 --> 01:17:07,169
(A moment earlier)

2309
01:17:07,195 --> 01:17:09,364
(I don't want to be Yondu and sell fish-shaped buns.)

2310
01:17:09,365 --> 01:17:12,539
(He was afraid of the penalty.)

2311
01:17:14,164 --> 01:17:16,064
(Gosh)

2312
01:17:16,065 --> 01:17:19,079
(He ate a candy because it made him suffer.)

2313
01:17:19,174 --> 01:17:21,579
- I'll hand it in. That's 9. - You ate 1.

2314
01:17:22,544 --> 01:17:24,314
(He bet 9 in total.)

2315
01:17:24,315 --> 01:17:26,074
Nine. You have none left.

2316
01:17:26,075 --> 01:17:27,484
Yes, nine. I'll bet all.

2317
01:17:27,485 --> 01:17:28,944
(He made the wrong decision.)

2318
01:17:28,945 --> 01:17:31,930
(The total is 28, so they go over by 1.)

2319
01:17:32,454 --> 01:17:34,860
You failed by one.

2320
01:17:35,225 --> 01:17:36,654
- Should I announce first place? - Yes.

2321
01:17:36,655 --> 01:17:38,529
(We know who's in last place.)

2322
01:17:39,155 --> 01:17:40,629
The person in first place is...

2323
01:17:40,825 --> 01:17:44,739
(1st place will be exempted from the penalty.)

2324
01:17:45,195 --> 01:17:46,869
It was very close.

2325
01:17:47,294 --> 01:17:48,879
Se Chan wins with 18.

2326
01:17:49,804 --> 01:17:51,104
Se Chan wins with 18.

2327
01:17:51,105 --> 01:17:53,774
(Se Chan is 1st place.)

2328
01:17:53,775 --> 01:17:55,444
Come on!

2329
01:17:55,445 --> 01:17:56,850
- He didn't bet any. - Come on!

2330
01:17:57,145 --> 01:17:58,274
I didn't.

2331
01:17:58,275 --> 01:17:59,444
(He didn't bet any.)

2332
01:17:59,445 --> 01:18:00,843
(Se Chan is exempted from the penalty.)

2333
01:18:00,844 --> 01:18:02,684
He didn't bet any?

2334
01:18:02,685 --> 01:18:03,713
I'm first place.

2335
01:18:03,714 --> 01:18:05,984
Se Chan was in last place after the 1st round with 6.

2336
01:18:05,985 --> 01:18:07,453
Right. Really?

2337
01:18:07,454 --> 01:18:09,123
- You were the one who bet. - I bet four.

2338
01:18:09,124 --> 01:18:10,824
- He won. - I went all-in in the second round.

2339
01:18:10,825 --> 01:18:11,994
I knew it.

2340
01:18:11,995 --> 01:18:14,440
- Jong Kook. - I knew you would win.

2341
01:18:14,794 --> 01:18:17,140
- That punk. - We knew it.

2342
01:18:17,225 --> 01:18:19,039
(That punk.)

2343
01:18:19,065 --> 01:18:21,239
I can't believe I'm doing business with this guy.

2344
01:18:22,004 --> 01:18:23,934
- You're exempted from the penalty. - Exempted.

2345
01:18:23,935 --> 01:18:25,034
(2nd place gets announced next.)

2346
01:18:25,035 --> 01:18:27,303
Jong Kook is in 2nd place with 17.

2347
01:18:27,304 --> 01:18:29,003
(Jong Kook is in 2nd place.)

2348
01:18:29,004 --> 01:18:30,644
- By 1. - I bet 2.

2349
01:18:30,645 --> 01:18:33,589
Seok Jin is in 3rd place with 15.

2350
01:18:33,645 --> 01:18:36,260
Next is Ji Hyo with 13.

2351
01:18:37,145 --> 01:18:39,529
Haha and Jae Seok were tied...

2352
01:18:39,584 --> 01:18:40,890
- They tied? - at 12.

2353
01:18:41,084 --> 01:18:43,029
Then what? So Min and Kwang Soo?

2354
01:18:43,124 --> 01:18:46,753
And So Min is in 7th place with 10.

2355
01:18:46,754 --> 01:18:49,600
The person in last place is Kwang Soo.

2356
01:18:50,195 --> 01:18:52,293
Penalties will be given to...

2357
01:18:52,294 --> 01:18:53,694
Kwang Soo and So Min.

2358
01:18:53,695 --> 01:18:55,133
(They have to dress up as Yondu and sell fish-shaped buns.)

2359
01:18:55,134 --> 01:18:58,404
They can pick one person to go with them.

2360
01:18:58,405 --> 01:18:59,749
- Se Chan, you are exempt. - Yes.

2361
01:19:00,174 --> 01:19:01,343
Let's talk.

2362
01:19:01,344 --> 01:19:02,803
(They get to pick 1 person to join them.)

2363
01:19:02,804 --> 01:19:04,644
Let's talk.

2364
01:19:04,645 --> 01:19:06,949
(Please, not me.)

2365
01:19:06,975 --> 01:19:08,560
Let's talk. Who do you want to pick?

2366
01:19:10,315 --> 01:19:13,129
(Kwang Soo says a name.)

2367
01:19:13,855 --> 01:19:14,984
- One person will join them. - Why?

2368
01:19:14,985 --> 01:19:16,883
- This is cruel. - Why?

2369
01:19:16,884 --> 01:19:17,999
We'll pick.

2370
01:19:18,895 --> 01:19:20,824
(They get to pick one person...)

2371
01:19:20,825 --> 01:19:23,739
(to join them and sell fish-shaped buns together.)

2372
01:19:24,535 --> 01:19:27,734
(Fish-shaped buns taste great in the cold weather.)

2373
01:19:27,735 --> 01:19:30,034
(To express their gratitude to their fans,)

2374
01:19:30,035 --> 01:19:32,810
(they'll be selling fish-shaped buns in the middle of the street.)

2375
01:19:33,905 --> 01:19:37,720
(Who are the lucky 3 up for the job?)

2376
01:19:39,874 --> 01:19:43,413
(Younger son Kwang Yondu)

2377
01:19:43,414 --> 01:19:47,114
(He's an expert in playing mutants.)

2378
01:19:47,115 --> 01:19:49,953
(Adorable daughter Jeon Yondu)

2379
01:19:49,954 --> 01:19:53,270
(You can't beat the original.)

2380
01:19:53,424 --> 01:19:57,199
(Who's the last member joining them?)

2381
01:19:57,664 --> 01:20:01,339
(Oldest son Kook Yondu)

2382
01:20:01,704 --> 01:20:05,074
(They called out members who were exempt.)

2383
01:20:05,075 --> 01:20:07,779
(They left one at a time.)

2384
01:20:08,044 --> 01:20:09,244
(Jong Kook and Haha were left behind.)

2385
01:20:09,245 --> 01:20:10,404
- Jong Kook. - Jong Kook.

2386
01:20:10,405 --> 01:20:11,814
(Jong Kook was the last person.)

2387
01:20:11,815 --> 01:20:13,213
(Haha was exempt.)

2388
01:20:13,214 --> 01:20:14,560
- Bye. - Bye.

2389
01:20:14,714 --> 01:20:16,043
Bye.

2390
01:20:16,044 --> 01:20:17,360
Thank you very much.

2391
01:20:17,544 --> 01:20:19,114
Thank you very much, you two.

2392
01:20:19,115 --> 01:20:20,184
(Jong Kook got the penalty.)

2393
01:20:20,185 --> 01:20:21,724
Goodness. Let's go.

2394
01:20:21,725 --> 01:20:23,623
(Jong Kook tried to stop Kwang Soo from messing up.)

2395
01:20:23,624 --> 01:20:27,024
(The Yondu trio is formed.)

2396
01:20:27,025 --> 01:20:28,093
(He's bitter.)

2397
01:20:28,094 --> 01:20:29,600
Please come over.

2398
01:20:29,865 --> 01:20:32,034
(They'll be expressing gratitude for all the support they got.)

2399
01:20:32,035 --> 01:20:34,333
- There are 70 made. - Okay.

2400
01:20:34,334 --> 01:20:36,503
One person can make 30 more.

2401
01:20:36,504 --> 01:20:38,434
- Two of you can hand them out. - Okay.

2402
01:20:38,435 --> 01:20:41,003
(She starts making ones filled with red beans.)

2403
01:20:41,004 --> 01:20:42,904
(Daughter Jeon Yondu is in charge.)

2404
01:20:42,905 --> 01:20:45,644
- Hello. - If you would like...

2405
01:20:45,645 --> 01:20:47,890
some fish-shaped buns, come on over.

2406
01:20:47,945 --> 01:20:49,684
We'll give fish-shaped buns out for free.

2407
01:20:49,685 --> 01:20:50,744
We'll give them out for free.

2408
01:20:50,745 --> 01:20:52,529
It's good.

2409
01:20:52,615 --> 01:20:55,860
We're not weirdos.

2410
01:20:55,985 --> 01:20:57,600
Don't retreat.

2411
01:20:58,225 --> 01:21:00,570
- I'm Jong Kook. He's Kwang Soo. - Right.

2412
01:21:00,594 --> 01:21:02,364
- Hello. - Hi.

2413
01:21:02,365 --> 01:21:04,123
(They have their first customers.)

2414
01:21:04,124 --> 01:21:06,110
- I washed my hands. - Give them two each.

2415
01:21:06,395 --> 01:21:08,503
I'll give you a red bean and a choux cream.

2416
01:21:08,504 --> 01:21:09,904
- Here you go. - Thank you.

2417
01:21:09,905 --> 01:21:11,333
Bye. All right.

2418
01:21:11,334 --> 01:21:12,774
- The 2 of you... - We'd like 6.

2419
01:21:12,775 --> 01:21:14,333
- We should give out two each. - Yes.

2420
01:21:14,334 --> 01:21:16,180
Right. You were pretty shocked, weren't you?

2421
01:21:16,344 --> 01:21:18,074
- Bye. - All of these...

2422
01:21:18,075 --> 01:21:20,244
- Kwang Soo. - Take a photo with me.

2423
01:21:20,245 --> 01:21:21,744
A photo? Sure.

2424
01:21:21,745 --> 01:21:23,213
(Their fish-shaped buns are delicious.)

2425
01:21:23,214 --> 01:21:24,784
- Should we put them in the cups? - Okay. In the paper cups?

2426
01:21:24,785 --> 01:21:25,953
- Let's give them out in the cups. - Okay.

2427
01:21:25,954 --> 01:21:27,753
- Thank you. - Thank you.

2428
01:21:27,754 --> 01:21:29,184
- Thank you. - Thank you.

2429
01:21:29,185 --> 01:21:30,484
- Thank you. - Thank you.

2430
01:21:30,485 --> 01:21:31,994
- Thank you. - Thank you.

2431
01:21:31,995 --> 01:21:34,154
You're done with your penalty.

2432
01:21:34,155 --> 01:21:35,894
Thank you.

2433
01:21:35,895 --> 01:21:37,123
She's Yondu.

2434
01:21:37,124 --> 01:21:39,194
- All right. - Okay.

2435
01:21:39,195 --> 01:21:41,864
We're Yondu Siblings.

2436
01:21:41,865 --> 01:21:44,503
I knew that things were going too well today.

2437
01:21:44,504 --> 01:21:45,503
(I'm sorry for choosing you.)

2438
01:21:45,504 --> 01:21:48,520
I never get that lucky, you know.

2439
01:21:48,745 --> 01:21:50,404
I eventually had to do the penalty.

2440
01:21:50,405 --> 01:21:51,489
(Clenching his teeth)

2441
01:21:52,044 --> 01:21:54,583
Well, this is just getting started.

2442
01:21:54,584 --> 01:21:56,820
It's really funny to see them fight with the makeup.

2443
01:21:57,584 --> 01:21:58,883
This is hilarious.

2444
01:21:58,884 --> 01:22:01,083
Talking to each other with the makeup...

2445
01:22:01,084 --> 01:22:04,994
makes me feel like I'm watching a musical.

01:22:11,294 --> 01:22:13,070

01:22:18,134 --> 01:22:19,833
(They will make investments in different fields every time.)

2453
01:22:19,834 --> 01:22:21,650
(They must carefully decide on whom to make investments.)

01:22:26,245 --> 01:22:28,560
(They must get investments with their unyielding bold acts.)

2457
01:22:28,615 --> 01:22:29,820
(And luck)

2458
01:22:30,445 --> 01:22:32,413
