1
00:00:06,220 --> 00:00:08,410
Hello. Good morning.

2
00:00:08,410 --> 00:00:10,120
(Today's shoot begins
a little earlier than usual.)

3
00:00:10,950 --> 00:00:12,360
(Kwang Soo arrives first.)

4
00:00:12,360 --> 00:00:13,380
Right away?

5
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:15,230
I need to get my makeup done
right away?

6
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:18,330
(He needs to get makeup done?)

7
00:00:18,330 --> 00:00:19,860
I shouldn't have gone
to the beauty salon.

8
00:00:19,860 --> 00:00:21,420
(He shouldn't have gotten
his hair and makeup done.)

9
00:00:21,470 --> 00:00:23,790
Hello. Hello, everyone.

10
00:00:23,790 --> 00:00:25,240
(What is this place?)

11
00:00:25,240 --> 00:00:26,430
Hello.

12
00:00:27,610 --> 00:00:30,310
(A familiar set
of makeover tools...)

13
00:00:30,310 --> 00:00:33,110
(and a bunch of different outfits
that have no correlation whatsoever)

14
00:00:33,110 --> 00:00:36,650
(And there's an unknown board
on one side of the dressing room.)

15
00:00:36,650 --> 00:00:38,720
(5 days before the day of shoot,
Mok-dong SBS)

16
00:00:39,010 --> 00:00:40,220
Hey, Chul Min.

17
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:42,610
- Hi, Suk Jin.
- Hey.

18
00:00:43,290 --> 00:00:45,650
This week, we're going to shoot
a year-end special,

19
00:00:45,650 --> 00:00:48,290
and we're going to hold
the 2019 Ggannes Film Festival.

20
00:00:48,290 --> 00:00:49,960
(We're going to hold
the 2019 Ggannes Film Festival)

21
00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:51,220
What's going on?

22
00:00:52,760 --> 00:00:55,670
- "Ggang"?
- "Ggannes Film Festival".

23
00:00:55,930 --> 00:00:58,230
- What is that?
- I prepared scene-stealing roles...

24
00:00:58,230 --> 00:00:59,230
from Korean movies.

25
00:00:59,230 --> 00:01:02,970
You'll each pick a role and race
dressed up as that person.

26
00:01:03,040 --> 00:01:04,800
- We need to dress up?
- Yes.

27
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:07,870
The male members can choose
from eight characters.

28
00:01:07,870 --> 00:01:09,950
Jiang Chen from "The Outlaws".
Agui from "Tazza".

29
00:01:09,950 --> 00:01:11,640
Jang Kyung Chul
from "I Saw the Devil".

30
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:13,890
A zombie from "Train to Busan".
Jo Tae Oh from "Veteran".

31
00:01:13,980 --> 00:01:15,590
Mr. Baek from "A Bittersweet Life".

32
00:01:15,590 --> 00:01:16,950
Grand Prince Suyang
from "The Face Reader".

33
00:01:16,950 --> 00:01:19,860
And the mother from "Mother".

34
00:01:20,260 --> 00:01:21,950
What? All of a sudden?

35
00:01:21,950 --> 00:01:25,030
Yes, the female members
can choose from four characters.

36
00:01:25,120 --> 00:01:27,030
Lee Geum Ja from "Lady Vengeance".

37
00:01:27,030 --> 00:01:28,470
Yeo Il from "Welcome to Dongmakgol".

38
00:01:28,470 --> 00:01:29,560
Madam Jeong from "Tazza".

39
00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:31,370
And Oh Dae Su from "Old Boy".

40
00:01:31,430 --> 00:01:33,900
- What?
- Those are the four characters.

41
00:01:34,030 --> 00:01:35,900
I'm guessing we can't choose
the characters.

42
00:01:35,900 --> 00:01:38,310
- We need to pick a number, right?
- Yes.

43
00:01:38,530 --> 00:01:40,110
I'll choose...

44
00:01:40,450 --> 00:01:42,670
I'll go with...

45
00:01:42,670 --> 00:01:43,780
Okay.

46
00:01:44,080 --> 00:01:48,450
Kwang Soo, there's only one left,
so that number is yours.

47
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:52,450
You'll find out what it is
on the day of the shoot.

48
00:01:53,120 --> 00:01:55,330
I didn't know we'd have to
get changed right away.

49
00:01:55,330 --> 00:01:56,590
(What kind of movie character
did Kwang Soo end up with?)

50
00:01:56,590 --> 00:01:57,860
I shouldn't have gone to the salon.

51
00:01:57,860 --> 00:01:59,760
You're number five.

52
00:02:00,330 --> 00:02:03,970
(What is number 5?)

53
00:02:03,970 --> 00:02:05,900
It's Jang Kyung Chul
from "I Saw the Devil".

54
00:02:05,900 --> 00:02:07,640
(Jang Kyung Chul
from "I Saw the Devil")

55
00:02:08,010 --> 00:02:09,840
It's Jang Kyung Chul
from "I Saw the Devil".

56
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:11,110
(Startled)

57
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:12,900
I really love this character.

58
00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:14,170
(I loved him in the movie.)

59
00:02:14,170 --> 00:02:15,270
But I...

60
00:02:15,270 --> 00:02:17,170
(But I don't want
to dress up as him.)

61
00:02:19,140 --> 00:02:20,980
(There's also a zombie.)

62
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:23,260
The person who got
the zombie role...

63
00:02:23,290 --> 00:02:26,420
should've started
their makeup yesterday.

64
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:28,450
It does take a while.

65
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:32,520
(He wears a wig after he finishes
getting his makeup.)

66
00:02:34,700 --> 00:02:35,830
(Taken aback)

67
00:02:36,760 --> 00:02:37,990
Are you sure
this is the right hairstyle?

68
00:02:39,230 --> 00:02:40,700
This is my mom's hairstyle.

69
00:02:40,700 --> 00:02:42,800
(This is my mom's hairstyle.)

70
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:45,380
(Jang Kyung Chul actually had
a middle-aged lady's haircut.)

71
00:02:45,510 --> 00:02:47,700
I'm pretty sure Choi Min Sik
didn't have this kind of hairstyle.

72
00:02:47,700 --> 00:02:49,920
(The awkward wig
somehow feels very familiar.)

73
00:02:51,140 --> 00:02:52,850
- Hello.
- What are you doing?

74
00:02:54,140 --> 00:02:56,610
(Jae Suk is the second person
to arrive.)

75
00:02:56,610 --> 00:02:57,760
I'm Jang Kyung Chul.

76
00:02:58,860 --> 00:02:59,920
(Are you...)

77
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:03,700
Are you on your way
to the morning soccer club?

78
00:03:04,260 --> 00:03:05,990
No, I'm a psychopath.

79
00:03:05,990 --> 00:03:07,330
(A psychopath
who likes to play soccer.)

80
00:03:07,330 --> 00:03:09,100
Jae Suk, you picked number seven,
so you're Grand Prince Suyang.

81
00:03:09,100 --> 00:03:10,940
- You're Grand Prince Suyang?
- My gosh.

82
00:03:11,330 --> 00:03:14,200
(Jae Suk will be dressing up
as Grand Prince Suyang.)

83
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:15,440
The outfit is going to be heavy.

84
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:17,440
(Will he be able to make it work?)

85
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:18,940
Do I need to wear this right now?

86
00:03:19,670 --> 00:03:20,770
You may begin getting changed.

87
00:03:24,140 --> 00:03:25,420
I'm beginning to look feminine.

88
00:03:27,710 --> 00:03:32,010
(He's slowly turning into
a very feminine psychopath.)

89
00:03:32,010 --> 00:03:36,600
(The world's prettiest psychopath)

90
00:03:36,950 --> 00:03:38,830
I think I've seen someone
who looks like this.

91
00:03:40,460 --> 00:03:41,670
I can't remember who it was.

92
00:03:42,260 --> 00:03:43,330
Where do I go?

93
00:03:43,330 --> 00:03:45,330
(The next member comes along.)

94
00:03:45,330 --> 00:03:47,460
(Laughing)

95
00:03:48,570 --> 00:03:52,440
(He looks like a middle-aged lady.)

96
00:03:52,770 --> 00:03:53,880
What is that?

97
00:03:54,380 --> 00:03:56,270
- I'm Jang Kyung Chul.
- I saw you from afar.

98
00:03:56,270 --> 00:03:59,580
- I thought you were Han Ki Beom.
- What are you talking about?

99
00:03:59,580 --> 00:04:02,550
(He got a makeover that looks
more similar to Han Ki Beom.)

100
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:04,290
What number did you choose?

101
00:04:04,290 --> 00:04:05,580
I chose number six. What did I get?

102
00:04:05,890 --> 00:04:07,020
You're the zombie?

103
00:04:07,230 --> 00:04:08,660
I chose number six. What did I get?

104
00:04:08,950 --> 00:04:10,200
You're the zombie?

105
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:11,390
A zombie?

106
00:04:11,390 --> 00:04:13,100
(You darn jerks.)

107
00:04:13,100 --> 00:04:16,440
(A ghastly look with blood stains
and weird joint movements,)

108
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:18,670
(the zombies were amazing
scene-stealers in "Train to Busan.")

109
00:04:18,670 --> 00:04:19,910
I'm a zombie?

110
00:04:19,910 --> 00:04:21,810
(Se Chan's character is
one of the zombies on the team.)

111
00:04:21,810 --> 00:04:23,330
Get changed into zombie clothes.

112
00:04:23,330 --> 00:04:24,580
Zombies don't have clothes.

113
00:04:24,580 --> 00:04:26,200
They do in "Train to Busan."

114
00:04:26,310 --> 00:04:27,510
Kwang Soo, I'm not even kidding.

115
00:04:27,580 --> 00:04:29,100
Can I take a photo of you
from behind?

116
00:04:29,450 --> 00:04:32,340
You look exactly like Han Ki Beom.

117
00:04:32,340 --> 00:04:33,710
(He really looks like him
from every angle.)

118
00:04:33,710 --> 00:04:35,490
- Will you cut it out?
- I'm serious.

119
00:04:35,620 --> 00:04:37,760
There's no doubt about it. Here.

120
00:04:37,780 --> 00:04:39,890
- This angle right here...
- I'm Jang Kyung Chul.

121
00:04:39,890 --> 00:04:41,020
This angle...

122
00:04:41,450 --> 00:04:42,560
It's Ki Beom.

123
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:44,000
(We dedicate this to Han Ki Beom
for giving us a good laugh.)

124
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:46,260
(Jae Suk is back dressed up
as Grand Prince Suyang.)

125
00:04:46,260 --> 00:04:47,590
Hello, you tall man.

126
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:48,870
Jae Suk.

127
00:04:49,130 --> 00:04:50,300
It actually suits you.

128
00:04:50,300 --> 00:04:51,370
(It actually suits you.)

129
00:04:51,370 --> 00:04:52,700
Do I have the face of a king?

130
00:04:52,700 --> 00:04:54,870
To be honest, you'd look much better
in a eunuch's uniform.

131
00:04:56,510 --> 00:04:58,080
- Hey, you punk.
- Jae Suk.

132
00:04:58,080 --> 00:04:59,680
You little punk.

133
00:05:00,310 --> 00:05:01,450
(Eunuch Jae Suk
gets his makeup done.)

134
00:05:01,450 --> 00:05:03,770
(Grand Prince Jae Suk
gets his makeup done.)

135
00:05:03,770 --> 00:05:05,450
Didn't Grand Prince Suyang
have a really manly beard?

136
00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:08,140
- What?
- Wait a minute.

137
00:05:08,140 --> 00:05:09,950
Grand Prince Suyang never
looked like a eunuch.

138
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:11,990
Grand Prince Suyang never
looked like a eunuch.

139
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:14,850
(Tiny mustache)

140
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:17,590
- Will you be quiet?
- I mean, your mustache...

141
00:05:18,060 --> 00:05:19,590
They look like whiskers on a rat.

142
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:21,830
Just keep going.

143
00:05:23,300 --> 00:05:24,570
What do they know?

144
00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:27,870
(He wears a cast.)

145
00:05:27,870 --> 00:05:31,740
Kwang Soo, did you hurt your arm?

146
00:05:31,740 --> 00:05:33,310
No, I didn't hurt it for real.

147
00:05:33,700 --> 00:05:35,270
- It's for my role.
- You didn't hurt your arm?

148
00:05:35,270 --> 00:05:36,580
No, I didn't.

149
00:05:37,320 --> 00:05:39,450
- Hello.
- Who is that?

150
00:05:39,710 --> 00:05:40,950
- Who is he supposed to be?
- Hello.

151
00:05:40,950 --> 00:05:42,140
- Hey.
- Who is he?

152
00:05:42,650 --> 00:05:44,350
- Look at you.
- What is that?

153
00:05:44,950 --> 00:05:46,650
Hello. Hello.

154
00:05:46,650 --> 00:05:48,650
- Who are you?
- "I Saw the Devil".

155
00:05:49,260 --> 00:05:50,720
- He's Han Ki Beom.
- No, wait.

156
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:52,150
- You're Ki Beom.
- No, I'm not.

157
00:05:52,630 --> 00:05:54,370
(It's like we invited him
as a guest on the show.)

158
00:05:54,370 --> 00:05:55,630
No, I'm not him.

159
00:05:55,630 --> 00:05:57,200
Choi Min Sik played this role
in "I Saw the Devil."

160
00:05:57,240 --> 00:05:59,570
- No, it's not that.
- He looks just like him.

161
00:05:59,870 --> 00:06:01,310
- So Min, what's your number?
- It's too early to tell.

162
00:06:01,310 --> 00:06:02,440
I picked number four.

163
00:06:02,440 --> 00:06:04,330
- It's too early to tell?
- We can't be sure yet.

164
00:06:04,330 --> 00:06:06,380
(He looks at the board
and glances at So Min.)

165
00:06:06,380 --> 00:06:09,380
So Min, you're Oh Dae Su.

166
00:06:09,710 --> 00:06:11,640
- You're Oh Dae Su.
- Are you serious?

167
00:06:11,640 --> 00:06:12,750
What am I?

168
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:16,080
Number 1 and 3 are already taken.

169
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:18,190
You're only left
with numbers 2 and 4.

170
00:06:18,190 --> 00:06:20,220
- You need to pick...
- What are they?

171
00:06:20,330 --> 00:06:21,630
I obviously can't tell you that.

172
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:23,390
I'm sorry about this.
But when I count to three,

173
00:06:23,390 --> 00:06:25,300
can you just pick one for me?

174
00:06:25,300 --> 00:06:26,460
In 1, 2, 3!

175
00:06:26,460 --> 00:06:27,520
Two!

176
00:06:27,890 --> 00:06:29,500
(The producer picks number two.)

177
00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:31,570
Then I'll go with number four.

178
00:06:31,570 --> 00:06:32,590
(Then I'll go with number four.)

179
00:06:32,590 --> 00:06:34,100
(So Min tried to outsmart
the producer and picked Oh Dae Su.)

180
00:06:34,100 --> 00:06:36,400
You picked number four, So Min.

181
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:38,310
Why am I the only guy?

182
00:06:39,180 --> 00:06:40,970
One of the guys picked
a female role as well.

183
00:06:40,970 --> 00:06:43,340
- But the others are all females.
- I'm Agui!

184
00:06:44,410 --> 00:06:47,140
I'm Agui!
I picked number four, right?

185
00:06:47,340 --> 00:06:48,450
I'm Agui!

186
00:06:48,450 --> 00:06:50,210
- I'm Jiang Chen.
- I chose number eight.

187
00:06:50,350 --> 00:06:52,690
- I just need to slick my hair back.
- What number did you pick?

188
00:06:52,690 --> 00:06:54,930
I need to play Mother?
I picked number eight.

189
00:06:54,930 --> 00:06:56,650
- Suk Jin, you're Mother?
- I need to dress up as Kim Hye Ja?

190
00:06:57,330 --> 00:06:58,520
Hey!

191
00:06:58,630 --> 00:07:00,330
Why are do you keep
doing this to me?

192
00:07:00,330 --> 00:07:01,460
You picked that number.

193
00:07:01,460 --> 00:07:03,240
This is going to be hard.

194
00:07:04,030 --> 00:07:07,700
Shouldn't he be
a grandmother instead?

195
00:07:08,570 --> 00:07:10,700
- Grandmother.
- Hey.

196
00:07:11,030 --> 00:07:13,640
Hey, Kim Hye Ja is older than I am.

197
00:07:13,750 --> 00:07:15,880
- It suits you.
- The outfit is nice, right?

198
00:07:15,880 --> 00:07:17,320
Don't I look okay in this?

199
00:07:17,450 --> 00:07:18,910
- It's nice.
- It looks really nice.

200
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:20,840
You should always dress like this.

201
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:23,010
- It looks good on you.
- You want me to dress like this?

202
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:25,280
So Min, you look
so much better in that suit.

203
00:07:25,350 --> 00:07:27,130
- Really?
- It really suits you.

204
00:07:27,190 --> 00:07:28,580
But I have to say,
judging by Jae Suk's looks,

205
00:07:28,580 --> 00:07:29,930
he wouldn't have been
an aristocrat...

206
00:07:30,020 --> 00:07:31,720
if he were born a long time ago.

207
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:34,200
(He wouldn't have been
an aristocrat.)

208
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:35,890
You wouldn't have been
someone with power.

209
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,940
- You'd be a commoner.
- He'd always be bowing to people.

210
00:07:38,940 --> 00:07:41,900
(He's always be bowing to people.)

211
00:07:42,660 --> 00:07:44,400
He'd always be
following his master around.

212
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:45,440
He'd always be so busy.

213
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:47,250
This is so annoying.
Why does this look good on me?

214
00:07:47,250 --> 00:07:48,600
(Laughing)

215
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:51,340
- Granny.
- Why does this look good on me?

216
00:07:51,640 --> 00:07:54,550
(He really looks
like a grandmother.)

217
00:07:54,550 --> 00:07:57,620
- This is so annoying.
- Look at his legs.

218
00:07:57,890 --> 00:07:59,720
- His legs fit perfectly.
- I thought you just came from home.

219
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:00,720
(Slim)

220
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:03,630
I thought you just came from home.
I thought it was your own outfit.

221
00:08:03,630 --> 00:08:04,800
- You should...
- Stop laughing.

222
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:05,890
You should dress
like this more often.

223
00:08:05,890 --> 00:08:08,760
- Why do I look good in this?
- I almost cried.

224
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,940
- Gosh, I shouldn't laugh.
- I almost cried.

225
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:14,030
I wanted to be a zombie or something
that makes me look intimidating.

226
00:08:14,100 --> 00:08:15,330
You look more intimidating.

227
00:08:16,140 --> 00:08:17,240
I'll be honest.

228
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:18,440
You look more intimidating
than anyone here.

229
00:08:18,440 --> 00:08:19,680
(He can suppress the zombie
with his looks.)

230
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:21,380
I got so angry
when I looked in the mirror...

231
00:08:21,380 --> 00:08:23,120
because the outfit looked
so good on me.

232
00:08:23,640 --> 00:08:26,450
I don't think I need any makeup.

233
00:08:26,450 --> 00:08:28,120
- Your wig.
- I think the wig will do.

234
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:29,490
Yes, you can start with the zombie.

235
00:08:29,490 --> 00:08:30,990
He already looks old enough.

236
00:08:30,990 --> 00:08:33,130
(He already looks old enough.)

237
00:08:33,130 --> 00:08:34,890
(His makeup is all done.)

238
00:08:34,890 --> 00:08:35,930
Sit down.

239
00:08:36,560 --> 00:08:37,720
Sit down.

240
00:08:37,830 --> 00:08:39,300
Did you get your makeup done
before you came here?

241
00:08:39,300 --> 00:08:40,360
(Already prepared)

242
00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:41,860
(Aging makeup)

243
00:08:41,860 --> 00:08:43,360
He's been getting ready for today.

244
00:08:43,730 --> 00:08:45,630
- Jong Kook.
- You look great.

245
00:08:46,230 --> 00:08:48,440
- You look amazing.
- He looks so normal.

246
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:50,870
- I still need to get my makeup.
- You need to get your makeup.

247
00:08:50,970 --> 00:08:52,840
If I see him outside,
I'd run for my life.

248
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:55,180
- I'm serious.
- Look at that fit.

249
00:08:55,180 --> 00:08:56,870
Your hair looks really nice today.

250
00:08:56,870 --> 00:08:58,740
- Jong Kook, you look amazing.
- You look great.

251
00:08:58,740 --> 00:09:00,740
But I still need to get
my makeup done.

252
00:09:00,740 --> 00:09:02,580
But you look so great.

253
00:09:02,980 --> 00:09:04,160
Your hair...

254
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:05,350
(Laughs)

255
00:09:05,980 --> 00:09:07,060
I mean...

256
00:09:07,060 --> 00:09:08,830
- I wanted to be Oh Dae Su.
- You kind of...

257
00:09:09,030 --> 00:09:10,850
You kind of look like An Young Mi.

258
00:09:10,850 --> 00:09:12,930
(She looks like An Young Mi
in the process of her makeover.)

259
00:09:12,930 --> 00:09:15,900
Hey, everyone looks funny here.
Look at Kwang Soo.

260
00:09:15,900 --> 00:09:17,630
Hey, Kwang Soo got hurt.

261
00:09:17,730 --> 00:09:18,960
I didn't get hurt for real.

262
00:09:19,130 --> 00:09:20,860
- Don't lie.
- I didn't get hurt.

263
00:09:20,860 --> 00:09:23,180
- He hurt his arm.
- This is just a prop.

264
00:09:23,180 --> 00:09:24,940
He came to the shoot
even though he got hurt.

265
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:26,840
He came to earn money.

266
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:28,100
No, it's not that.

267
00:09:28,100 --> 00:09:29,370
- It's not?
- It's just a prop.

268
00:09:29,370 --> 00:09:30,920
(He suddenly makes Kwang Soo
seem like he's crazy about money.)

269
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:32,710
- Ji Hyo.
- You look so pretty.

270
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:34,380
- What are you?
- Ma'am.

271
00:09:34,450 --> 00:09:35,610
(Song Geum Ja is here.)

272
00:09:35,610 --> 00:09:36,610
Ma'am.

273
00:09:37,790 --> 00:09:38,950
(She also looks exactly like
the character she chose.)

274
00:09:38,950 --> 00:09:41,220
- My gosh, my outfit is too...
- My gosh, Se Chan.

275
00:09:41,380 --> 00:09:42,930
Se Chan, what are you?

276
00:09:42,930 --> 00:09:44,400
(He's getting
his zombie makeup done.)

277
00:09:44,700 --> 00:09:45,830
- What?
- What are you?

278
00:09:45,830 --> 00:09:47,070
- Oh, you're a zombie?
- Hey, are you...

279
00:09:47,070 --> 00:09:50,070
Are you a beggar?

280
00:09:50,770 --> 00:09:52,230
You look more like
a homeless beggar.

281
00:09:52,770 --> 00:09:53,860
I look like I didn't wash.

282
00:09:53,860 --> 00:09:55,070
Are you guys roommates?

283
00:09:55,070 --> 00:09:56,410
- No, I'm not like him.
- Do you live together?

284
00:09:56,410 --> 00:09:57,500
I'm not filthy like him.

285
00:09:57,940 --> 00:09:59,330
Hey, stop it. Kwang Soo is hurt.

286
00:09:59,330 --> 00:10:01,470
No, I'm not! I didn't get hurt!

287
00:10:01,470 --> 00:10:02,680
He's not well.

288
00:10:02,680 --> 00:10:04,050
- No, I'm fine!
- What's the matter with him?

289
00:10:04,050 --> 00:10:05,450
- I didn't get hurt!
- He hurt himself.

290
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:07,020
This is just a prop!

291
00:10:07,580 --> 00:10:09,050
How many times did I tell you?
It's just a prop.

292
00:10:09,050 --> 00:10:10,080
Kwang Soo got hurt.

293
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:12,020
- No, I didn't.
- He's hurt.

294
00:10:12,020 --> 00:10:13,120
No, this is makeup.

295
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:15,430
Suk Jin, So Min, you,
and Kwang Soo...

296
00:10:15,430 --> 00:10:16,590
all live together.

297
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:18,950
(All four of them...)

298
00:10:18,950 --> 00:10:20,570
(look shabby.)

299
00:10:20,570 --> 00:10:22,220
- I'm serious.
- It's like "Parasite."

300
00:10:22,220 --> 00:10:24,490
Their lives are tough.

301
00:10:24,700 --> 00:10:26,330
Their lives are tough.

302
00:10:26,670 --> 00:10:28,070
They live in a boarding house.

303
00:10:30,080 --> 00:10:31,330
Come on.

304
00:10:31,330 --> 00:10:32,630
(He's taking a photo of So Min.)

305
00:10:34,410 --> 00:10:36,920
(Laughing)

306
00:10:38,050 --> 00:10:39,920
(Why is he laughing?)

307
00:10:41,520 --> 00:10:43,380
Darn it.

308
00:10:43,380 --> 00:10:44,690
What is this?

309
00:10:45,450 --> 00:10:46,750
What is this?

310
00:10:47,750 --> 00:10:49,700
(Laughing)

311
00:10:49,700 --> 00:10:51,660
Isn't this too much?

312
00:10:51,660 --> 00:10:53,400
- Come on.
- This is hilarious.

313
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:54,860
What are you doing?

314
00:10:54,860 --> 00:10:56,400
- So Min.
- Come on.

315
00:10:56,400 --> 00:10:57,770
(She turns her head.)

316
00:10:59,910 --> 00:11:02,910
(Jong Kook bursts into laughter.)

317
00:11:02,910 --> 00:11:04,910
(He's at a loss for words.)

318
00:11:04,910 --> 00:11:06,550
Gosh, So Min.

319
00:11:06,910 --> 00:11:08,240
What should we do with her?

320
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:11,210
- My gosh.
- She is hilarious.

321
00:11:11,210 --> 00:11:12,320
(All the members complete
their transformation.)

322
00:11:12,450 --> 00:11:13,580
- Hey.
- Yes?

323
00:11:13,580 --> 00:11:16,020
You look really scary as well.

324
00:11:16,020 --> 00:11:17,690
I wanted to be Madam Jeong.

325
00:11:17,690 --> 00:11:19,830
- Who's Mr. Baek?
- It's our guest.

326
00:11:19,830 --> 00:11:20,950
What a shame.

327

(2019 Running Man's
Ggannes Film Festival)

328
00:11:25,220 --> 00:11:28,570

is being held in Sangam-dong,)

329
00:11:28,570 --> 00:11:31,830
(and countless celebrities
have attended.)

330
00:11:31,830 --> 00:11:34,960
(The red carpet is on fire.)

331
00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:36,680
(This is the highlight
of this festival.)

332
00:11:36,680 --> 00:11:37,680
Okay.

333
00:11:37,910 --> 00:11:39,410
This is a film festival.

334
00:11:39,780 --> 00:11:43,150
And we're dressed like this?

335
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:45,580
My goodness.

337
00:11:46,610 --> 00:11:48,290

(He improvises.)

342
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:02,590
- You just hit me.
- Zombies don't feel pain.

343
00:12:02,590 --> 00:12:04,540
- They don't?
- They get back up.

344
00:12:05,230 --> 00:12:06,810
- What is this?
- Aren't those long johns?

345
00:12:06,810 --> 00:12:07,940

have gathered together.)

00:12:09,870 --> 00:12:11,100
Do I have the face of a king?

348
00:12:11,100 --> 00:12:12,680
No, I swear. You don't.

349
00:12:12,680 --> 00:12:15,780
Haha looks like Agui got struck
with lightning...

350
00:12:15,780 --> 00:12:17,420
and turned into a kid.

351
00:12:18,470 --> 00:12:20,150
(He's become small-sized.)

352
00:12:20,150 --> 00:12:22,320
- He's become a kid.
- A kid?

353
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:25,660
- He's just a kid.
- Daddy.

354
00:12:25,660 --> 00:12:27,830
- He's just a kid.
- He's not Agui.

355
00:12:27,830 --> 00:12:30,620
- He's not Agui.
- That's not Agui's hairstyle.

356
00:12:30,620 --> 00:12:32,450
You have a hunched back.

357
00:12:32,700 --> 00:12:34,830
- Jong Kook looks frightening.
- He does.

358
00:12:34,830 --> 00:12:36,300
He's so scary.

359
00:12:36,300 --> 00:12:38,230
There are many people like him
in Mexico.

360
00:12:38,230 --> 00:12:39,960
He looks like a South American.

361
00:12:39,960 --> 00:12:41,630
He looks like a character
from "Narcos."

362
00:12:41,630 --> 00:12:43,130
- Right.
- I bet he has a gun in his pocket.

363
00:12:43,630 --> 00:12:44,630
(I've seen him before.)

364
00:12:44,630 --> 00:12:45,780
I bet.

365
00:12:46,550 --> 00:12:48,970
- No.
- Hey.

366
00:12:48,970 --> 00:12:50,110
Come here, Pomeranian.

367
00:12:50,610 --> 00:12:52,020
- Hey.
- He's a zombie.

368
00:12:52,020 --> 00:12:55,950
Come here, Pomeranian.

369
00:12:56,210 --> 00:12:57,610
(Barking)

370
00:12:57,610 --> 00:12:59,660
(This kid has a Pomeranian.)

371
00:12:59,660 --> 00:13:01,380
She played along with it.

372
00:13:01,830 --> 00:13:02,930
She did.

373
00:13:02,930 --> 00:13:04,560
She looks hilarious.

374
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:07,770
Jong Kook has started
his nationwide concert.

375
00:13:07,770 --> 00:13:09,070
It started on December 14.

376
00:13:09,170 --> 00:13:10,860
- Isn't the tour called "Genuine?"
- Yes, that's right.

377
00:13:10,860 --> 00:13:12,540
- December 14?
- Yes.

378
00:13:13,310 --> 00:13:15,200
- December 14?
- Yes.

379
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:16,780
- It has already started.
- It has begun already.

380
00:13:16,780 --> 00:13:18,180
- We started two days ago.
- You already started.

381
00:13:18,180 --> 00:13:19,230
Yes.

382
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:20,680
I'm sorry...

383
00:13:20,680 --> 00:13:22,740
- I didn't know.
- That's okay.

384
00:13:22,740 --> 00:13:25,180
I appeared as a guest...

385
00:13:25,180 --> 00:13:27,020
- and as his Turbo partner.
- Right.

386
00:13:27,210 --> 00:13:30,820
I think it was
three stages before mine.

387
00:13:30,820 --> 00:13:32,580
You watched my entire concert?

388
00:13:32,580 --> 00:13:34,450
- I thought I had heard it wrong.
- Why?

389
00:13:34,620 --> 00:13:35,660
- Why?
- Why?

390
00:13:35,660 --> 00:13:36,800
All of a sudden,

391
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:39,530
I heard "Raise Your Voice."

392
00:13:39,530 --> 00:13:42,200
(Jong Kook, Gummy, and Haha
did a collaboration before.)

393
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:43,270
The one you had performed
with Gummy?

394
00:13:43,270 --> 00:13:45,540
He was singing my part.

395
00:13:46,700 --> 00:13:49,200
(He was singing all of their parts.)

396
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:50,330
My gosh.

397
00:13:50,330 --> 00:13:52,200
- Really?
- I'm serious.

398
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:55,000
Meanwhile, he told me to sing
along to Kim Jung Nam's parts!

399
00:13:55,310 --> 00:13:57,110
I'm alive and well!

400
00:13:57,340 --> 00:13:59,680
I was in that green room!

401
00:13:59,820 --> 00:14:00,950
I was the one who sang it,

402
00:14:00,950 --> 00:14:02,080
- Wait.
- but he didn't invite me.

403
00:14:02,080 --> 00:14:03,250
On top of that,

404
00:14:03,250 --> 00:14:04,980
the concert director came to me...

405
00:14:05,080 --> 00:14:06,930
and asked if I was performing it
with Haha.

406
00:14:07,030 --> 00:14:10,060
I said no.

407
00:14:10,060 --> 00:14:11,160
(He refused to perform a duet.)

408
00:14:11,160 --> 00:14:12,450
I said I didn't want him to sing.

409
00:14:12,700 --> 00:14:15,360
Since we're on this topic,
let me say something too.

410
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:16,430
(Jae Suk wants to add
to the conversation.)

411
00:14:16,430 --> 00:14:18,070
- You know Jeon SORAN, right?
- Yes?

412
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:20,410
These two are singing it.

413
00:14:20,700 --> 00:14:22,460
(It's a collaboration made
by SORAN, So Min, and Jae Suk.)

414
00:14:22,460 --> 00:14:24,970
These two are singing it.

415
00:14:24,970 --> 00:14:27,200
- Is So Min on Jong Kook's side?
- Hold on.

416
00:14:27,280 --> 00:14:29,470
- Hey. My gosh.
- That's not right.

417
00:14:29,470 --> 00:14:31,970
Where's Jae Suk
in Jeon SORAN and Yoo Jae Suk?

418
00:14:31,970 --> 00:14:34,690
- It's Jeon SORAN and Kim Jong Kook.
- You're right.

419
00:14:34,690 --> 00:14:37,320
- No, we're the National Siblings.
- National Siblings?

420
00:14:37,980 --> 00:14:40,190
- I was disappointed.
- All right.

421
00:14:40,190 --> 00:14:43,430
So Min celebrated
Se Chan's birthday.

422
00:14:43,590 --> 00:14:45,300
- Goodness.
- That isn't it.

423
00:14:45,300 --> 00:14:48,120
- I left a comment.
- I know this. It's a heart.

424
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:50,070
(This happened?)

425
00:14:50,070 --> 00:14:52,400
That's not it. I didn't know
that it was his birthday.

426
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:53,410
- So Min.
- I just posted that.

427
00:14:53,410 --> 00:14:55,230
- Don't lie.
- It was just the timing.

428
00:14:55,310 --> 00:14:56,630
I really had no idea.

429
00:14:56,630 --> 00:14:58,700
- Come on.
- I'm serious.

430
00:14:58,700 --> 00:15:01,340
While having beef-bone soup,

431
00:15:01,340 --> 00:15:03,840
I found a heart. I was surprised,
so I posted that photo.

432
00:15:03,840 --> 00:15:05,970
And that day happened to be
his birthday.

433
00:15:06,580 --> 00:15:09,020
- I had no idea.
- Bo Ra told me...

434
00:15:09,020 --> 00:15:10,480
that you enjoy flirting with him.

435
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:13,020
(After 2 episodes on this show,
Bo Ra said...)

436
00:15:13,020 --> 00:15:16,220
(that So Min enjoyed flirting.)

437
00:15:16,220 --> 00:15:17,300
Bo Ra.

438
00:15:18,300 --> 00:15:20,700
What did Jong Kook write?

439
00:15:20,700 --> 00:15:22,800
"It's a surprise birthday gift
for Se Chan."

440
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:25,230
- Right.
- I find his actions funny.

441
00:15:25,230 --> 00:15:26,270
He's quite meticulous.

442
00:15:26,270 --> 00:15:27,460
Why do you leave comments...

443
00:15:27,460 --> 00:15:28,630
- on her social media?
- It's not like that.

444
00:15:29,270 --> 00:15:31,230
( - What are you saying?
- My gosh...)

445
00:15:31,230 --> 00:15:33,550
- It's as if he's jealous.
- No.

446
00:15:33,550 --> 00:15:35,600
- Do you like her?
- Her posts...

447
00:15:35,780 --> 00:15:39,840
make me want to leave comments.

448
00:15:39,840 --> 00:15:42,380
Do you know
what will give me goosebumps?

449
00:15:42,380 --> 00:15:44,080
- What?
- If we keep trying...

450
00:15:44,080 --> 00:15:47,290
to root for So Min and Se Chan,
and then one day,

451
00:15:47,430 --> 00:15:50,450
So Min and Jong Kook announce
their marriage.

452
00:15:50,750 --> 00:15:53,030
(Everyone is aghast.)

453
00:15:53,700 --> 00:15:55,270
- What will happen to me?
- Then...

454
00:15:55,270 --> 00:15:56,460
- What will happen to me?
- Don't you get goosebumps?

455
00:15:56,460 --> 00:15:57,730
I'm going to be a hermit
for three years.

456
00:15:57,730 --> 00:15:58,960
- Seriously.
- Seriously.

457
00:15:58,960 --> 00:16:01,270
If that happens, I'm going
to take a rest from this show.

458
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:03,540
- Me too. I'd feel too betrayed.
- They would've fooled us.

459
00:16:03,810 --> 00:16:06,280
- I'd have to take a rest.
- That'd be shocking.

460
00:16:06,280 --> 00:16:09,550
- We will now begin the festival.
- We will?

461
00:16:09,550 --> 00:16:12,020
We have also brought
other guests.

462
00:16:12,020 --> 00:16:13,710
- Really?
- We have guests.

463
00:16:13,710 --> 00:16:16,290
We will bring in
the female guests first.

464
00:16:16,290 --> 00:16:18,190
- Please come on out.
- There was "Welcome to Dongmakgol".

465
00:16:18,190 --> 00:16:20,560
- There was Madam Jeong too.
- Right.

466
00:16:20,790 --> 00:16:22,450
- It's Jun Hyosung.
- Hyosung.

467
00:16:22,450 --> 00:16:23,700
Hyosung!

468
00:16:23,700 --> 00:16:24,720
(She's dressed as Madam Jeong.)

469
00:16:26,430 --> 00:16:30,330
(She is a sexy diva
with 11 years of experience.)

470
00:16:30,330 --> 00:16:34,200
(Being talented, she has also
branched out into acting.)

471
00:16:34,670 --> 00:16:36,130
It's been a long time.

472
00:16:36,130 --> 00:16:37,200
Have you been well?

473
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:39,580
- Have you been well?
- Have you been well?

474
00:16:39,580 --> 00:16:41,050
Yes, what about you?

475
00:16:41,050 --> 00:16:42,550
(Who else has visited?)

476
00:16:42,550 --> 00:16:44,240
It's Yoyomi.

477
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:45,710
- It's Yoyomi.
- It's Yoyomi.

478
00:16:45,710 --> 00:16:46,740
(This trot singer has dressed up
as Yeo Il.)

479
00:16:47,050 --> 00:16:49,980
(Netizens were the first ones
to recognize her talent.)

480
00:16:49,980 --> 00:16:53,560
(Her cover of Hye Eun Lee's song
has grabbed their attention.)

481
00:16:53,560 --> 00:16:58,430
(Afterward, her song,
"Who is this guy?" became a hit.)

482
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:00,330
Yoyomi.

483
00:17:00,330 --> 00:17:02,070
- Hey.
- The trot singers have met.

484
00:17:02,270 --> 00:17:03,960
- Hello, Yu San Seul.
- Have you been well?

485
00:17:04,200 --> 00:17:07,200
- Goodness.
- Yu San Seul...

486
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:08,960
- and Yoyomi have met.
- It suits her.

487
00:17:08,960 --> 00:17:10,580
- Hello.
- Hello.

488
00:17:10,580 --> 00:17:12,010
- Hyosung, come to the center.
- Okay.

489
00:17:12,010 --> 00:17:13,550
- It suits her.
- Yoyomi.

490
00:17:13,550 --> 00:17:15,940
It's been a long time.

491
00:17:15,940 --> 00:17:17,480
- You're right.
- It sure has been.

492
00:17:17,480 --> 00:17:18,640
- It's been ages.
- I know.

493
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:20,020
- This is your first time here.
- Yes.

494
00:17:20,020 --> 00:17:21,840
- We've talked on the phone.
- This is your first time?

495
00:17:21,840 --> 00:17:23,850
- Yes.
- Are you serious?

496
00:17:23,850 --> 00:17:25,110
Yes.

497
00:17:25,110 --> 00:17:26,880
- You guys are too mean.
- You're too mean.

498
00:17:27,180 --> 00:17:28,880
You're too mean.

499
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:30,330
Put that back in.

500
00:17:30,850 --> 00:17:33,530
(I won't forgive you all.)

501
00:17:33,530 --> 00:17:35,530
- Stab me instead.
- Come on.

502
00:17:35,530 --> 00:17:37,590
You should've invited her sooner.

503
00:17:37,590 --> 00:17:39,630
It's been 11 years since my debut.

504
00:17:39,630 --> 00:17:41,630
And this is my first time
on this show.

505
00:17:41,630 --> 00:17:42,930
This is unbelievable.

506
00:17:42,930 --> 00:17:45,010
Please say hi, Yoyomi.

507
00:17:45,010 --> 00:17:46,600
Hello, everyone.

508
00:17:46,600 --> 00:17:48,940
I'm a happy virus
and a singing fairy.

509
00:17:48,940 --> 00:17:51,080
- My name is Yoyomi.
- How cute.

510
00:17:51,080 --> 00:17:53,440
- She's so cute. See?
- She is really adorable.

511
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:54,550
You remember, right?

512
00:17:54,550 --> 00:17:56,990
I told you guys that
she was a promising trot singer,

513
00:17:56,990 --> 00:17:58,680
- didn't I? Right, Jae Suk?
- Hey.

514
00:17:58,680 --> 00:18:00,380
- When did you tell me that?
- Why is your back facing me?

515
00:18:00,380 --> 00:18:01,460
I'm sorry.

516
00:18:01,460 --> 00:18:02,760
My goodness.

517
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:04,960
- Just step up.
- Come on.

518
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:06,860
- You should just step up.
- Why do you keep doing that?

519
00:18:06,860 --> 00:18:09,970
Jong Kook, I thought you were
taking out your gun.

520
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:11,860
- I was startled.
- Me too.

521
00:18:11,860 --> 00:18:13,300
- Why are you doing that?
- I was startled.

522
00:18:13,300 --> 00:18:15,570
I saw Yoyomi for the first time
when she sang...

523
00:18:15,570 --> 00:18:16,980
"Third Han River Bridge"...

524
00:18:16,980 --> 00:18:18,930
- by Hae Eun Lee.
- I watched her singing...

525
00:18:18,930 --> 00:18:21,440
- "You Don't Know".
- She was...

526
00:18:22,370 --> 00:18:24,170
- I was...
- I recognize her!

527
00:18:24,170 --> 00:18:26,280
- I know her.
- At first, I thought...

528
00:18:26,280 --> 00:18:28,220
it was filtered.

529
00:18:28,220 --> 00:18:30,410
She really looks like Hae Eun Lee.

530
00:18:30,410 --> 00:18:32,320
- You're right.
- Right?

531
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:34,330
- Right.
- Can you sing a bit for us?

532
00:18:34,330 --> 00:18:36,150
Before that,
let's bring out the male guests.

533
00:18:36,150 --> 00:18:37,650
Oh, there are more.

534
00:18:37,890 --> 00:18:40,070
(Let's bring in
the male guests first.)

535
00:18:40,070 --> 00:18:41,620
Suk Jin, come on.

536
00:18:41,970 --> 00:18:44,660
- You were waiting for this moment.
- No, I wasn't.

537
00:18:44,830 --> 00:18:46,660
Why do you always cut me off?

538
00:18:46,660 --> 00:18:47,930
It's not like that.

539
00:18:47,930 --> 00:18:48,930
Who are they?

540
00:18:48,930 --> 00:18:51,540
- They're the male guests.
- Who are they?

541
00:18:51,670 --> 00:18:55,340
Fail to impress me,
and you'll get a taste of my sword.

542
00:18:56,050 --> 00:18:59,020
- Just stab me instead.
- He doesn't suit his character.

543
00:18:59,610 --> 00:19:00,750
He looks too awkward.

544
00:19:00,750 --> 00:19:02,580
- He suddenly changed his voice.
- Who is it?

545
00:19:02,820 --> 00:19:04,560
- Who is it?
- Who is it?

546
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:07,830
It's Kyung-hwan?

547
00:19:07,830 --> 00:19:08,850
(Heo Kyung-hwan is dressed up
as Jo Tae Oh from "Veteran.")

548
00:19:09,290 --> 00:19:12,120
(Looking motivated, he appeared
on the show one month ago.)

549
00:19:12,150 --> 00:19:13,260
Hold on.

550
00:19:13,260 --> 00:19:14,690
Why are you in a hurry?

551
00:19:14,770 --> 00:19:17,690
- Yang.
- Yang Se Chan, it's been a while.

552
00:19:17,690 --> 00:19:19,070
Have you washed your face?

553
00:19:19,070 --> 00:19:22,570
Wash your face with cold water.

554
00:19:22,570 --> 00:19:24,400
(He completely ruined
the opening scene.)

555
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:25,870
- What was that?
- He's known for making...

556
00:19:25,870 --> 00:19:28,050
- his fellow comedians laugh.
- No, I'm not.

557
00:19:28,050 --> 00:19:30,170
I've failed to make this nation
laugh for over 10 years now.

558
00:19:30,170 --> 00:19:31,220
(However...)

559
00:19:31,220 --> 00:19:32,220
(He's come back to save face.)

560
00:19:32,220 --> 00:19:33,820
I'm looking for a chance.

561
00:19:35,550 --> 00:19:37,060
(They're not surprised.)

562
00:19:37,060 --> 00:19:38,410
It's Kyung-hwan?

563
00:19:38,410 --> 00:19:39,580
Who's that behind him?

564
00:19:39,580 --> 00:19:41,380
(Behind the excited Kyung-hwan
is another guest.)

565
00:19:41,380 --> 00:19:42,730
It's Kang Tae Oh.

566
00:19:43,350 --> 00:19:44,350
It's Tae Oh.

567
00:19:45,330 --> 00:19:46,650
I'm sorry.

568
00:19:46,650 --> 00:19:47,730
(He's good-looking and talented.)

569
00:19:48,230 --> 00:19:49,660
I killed him.

570
00:19:49,660 --> 00:19:50,740
(He's acted in various genres.)

571
00:19:50,890 --> 00:19:52,930
(In variety shows, he's showed
his manly and foolish sides.)

572
00:19:52,930 --> 00:19:54,900
- Tae Oh!
- I'll drop this!

573
00:19:55,710 --> 00:19:56,980
It's Tae Oh.

574
00:19:57,240 --> 00:20:00,370
- Hello.
- Hello.

575
00:20:00,370 --> 00:20:02,780
It's Jo Tae Oh and Mr. Baek.

576
00:20:04,050 --> 00:20:05,050
Who are you?

577
00:20:05,050 --> 00:20:06,170
Kyung-hwan, look at you.

578
00:20:06,550 --> 00:20:07,720
(He suddenly stabs him.)

579
00:20:07,720 --> 00:20:09,680
(Exclaiming)

580
00:20:11,260 --> 00:20:12,490
Take that!

581
00:20:12,490 --> 00:20:14,490
They came up with a sketch.

582
00:20:14,680 --> 00:20:16,260
(They're lost in their characters.)

583
00:20:16,530 --> 00:20:17,730
What is it?

584
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:18,850
- You're right.
- Right?

585
00:20:18,850 --> 00:20:20,030
- It's Mr. Baek.
- Mr. Baek.

586
00:20:20,030 --> 00:20:21,660
- Him and...
- I bet they have more lines.

587
00:20:21,660 --> 00:20:22,800
- It's a sketch.
- Let's wait and see.

588
00:20:22,970 --> 00:20:25,660
What's that expression?

589
00:20:25,660 --> 00:20:26,860
(What's that expression?)

590
00:20:27,070 --> 00:20:30,330
It was wrong of you to seek me out.

591
00:20:30,330 --> 00:20:31,330
What is this?

592
00:20:31,330 --> 00:20:33,100
- It's a sketch.
- What?

593
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:36,250
They're in the middle
of a boring sketch.

594
00:20:36,250 --> 00:20:37,670
(Awkward and unprepared)

595
00:20:37,720 --> 00:20:39,320
Take that.

596
00:20:39,320 --> 00:20:41,220
You couldn't even do that right?

597
00:20:41,220 --> 00:20:42,220
(Take that!)

598
00:20:43,220 --> 00:20:45,410
- He had more lines.
- Were you Yoo Ah In?

599
00:20:45,410 --> 00:20:47,530
- Yoo Ah In?
- Is that so?

600
00:20:47,530 --> 00:20:49,530
You should've made it
more entertaining.

601
00:20:49,530 --> 00:20:50,890
We were getting there.

602
00:20:50,890 --> 00:20:52,530
Why not add some catchphrases?

603
00:20:52,530 --> 00:20:56,330
It's the worst sketch
I've seen in the past three years.

604
00:20:56,890 --> 00:20:59,130
- It wasn't a sketch.
- It's what it was,

605
00:20:59,130 --> 00:21:01,210
- you know.
- You know.

606
00:21:01,540 --> 00:21:04,210
- We had another scene coming.
- Gosh.

607
00:21:04,330 --> 00:21:06,130
- And so...
- Is that it?

608
00:21:06,130 --> 00:21:07,750
The four will be joining us today.

609
00:21:07,750 --> 00:21:09,870
(Is that it for us?)

610
00:21:10,340 --> 00:21:12,580
Opening acts always fail.

611
00:21:12,580 --> 00:21:13,680
- Quiet now.
- But the producer...

612
00:21:13,680 --> 00:21:14,910
That's enough.

613
00:21:14,940 --> 00:21:16,220
It was the most boring.

614
00:21:16,220 --> 00:21:17,960
Let me first introduce you...

615
00:21:17,960 --> 00:21:20,460
to a rising star
in the trot industry.

616
00:21:20,460 --> 00:21:22,880
It's Park Yeon Ah
who's known as Yoyomi.

617
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:24,650
- Gosh.
- Yoyomi!

618
00:21:24,650 --> 00:21:26,150
Is Park Yeon Ah your real name?

619
00:21:26,150 --> 00:21:27,890
Yes, that's my real name.

620
00:21:27,890 --> 00:21:29,230
The name suits you.

621
00:21:29,230 --> 00:21:31,500
Is that your usual tone or are you
talking like that on purpose?

622
00:21:31,500 --> 00:21:33,900
- Just so you know...
- It's my usual voice.

623
00:21:33,900 --> 00:21:34,970
This is her first time
on a big variety show.

624
00:21:34,970 --> 00:21:36,630
So this is the character
she made for herself?

625
00:21:36,630 --> 00:21:38,600
- Was it planned?
- It's made-up?

626
00:21:38,600 --> 00:21:40,040
This isn't how you usually talk.

627
00:21:40,040 --> 00:21:41,840
No, this is my usual voice.

628
00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:43,100
- Really?
- Yes,

629
00:21:43,100 --> 00:21:45,750
Yoyomi's voice
is always in this tone.

630
00:21:45,750 --> 00:21:47,050
It's adorable.

631
00:21:47,050 --> 00:21:49,610
Since you're here,
could you perhaps sing...

632
00:21:49,610 --> 00:21:51,060
"Third Han River Bridge"
by Hae Eun Lee...

633
00:21:51,060 --> 00:21:53,220
which I heard on
your personal channel?

634
00:21:53,220 --> 00:21:56,530
The song itself
is actually quite sexy.

635
00:21:56,530 --> 00:21:58,390
I see. So?

636
00:21:58,390 --> 00:22:00,890
It wouldn't quite work
with the outfit I have on.

637
00:22:00,890 --> 00:22:02,330
It's all right. Just look at So Min.

638
00:22:02,330 --> 00:22:03,500
(It's all right.
Just look at So Min.)

639
00:22:03,860 --> 00:22:06,800
- Let her give you courage.
- Is that So Min?

640
00:22:06,800 --> 00:22:08,160
- I look sexy, right?
- That's why...

641
00:22:08,930 --> 00:22:11,130
- See?
- You look like Bob, the painter.

642
00:22:11,130 --> 00:22:12,810
Bob Ross.

643
00:22:13,240 --> 00:22:15,640
Please sing it for us.
Is there a recording ready?

644
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:17,750
- Is there one?
- I'll sing without one.

645
00:22:17,750 --> 00:22:19,140
- Sure.
- All right.

646
00:22:19,140 --> 00:22:20,140
Here we go.

647
00:22:20,410 --> 00:22:25,180
<i>The river flows</i>

648
00:22:25,180 --> 00:22:28,330
<i>Under the 3rd Han River Bridge</i>

649
00:22:28,330 --> 00:22:29,880
She sounds just like Hae Eun Lee.

650
00:22:29,880 --> 00:22:31,260
(She sounds the same.)

651
00:22:32,120 --> 00:22:34,160
(She touches our hearts even
without instrumental accompaniment.)

652
00:22:34,160 --> 00:22:37,570
(You'd believe that
she's living her 2nd life.)

653
00:22:38,390 --> 00:22:39,590
(Nice!)

654
00:22:39,590 --> 00:22:40,900
Did you hear that?

655
00:22:40,900 --> 00:22:42,630
She sounded just like Hae Eun Lee.

656
00:22:42,630 --> 00:22:44,370
Their voices are identical.

657
00:22:44,370 --> 00:22:45,740
She even looks like Hae Eun Lee too.

658
00:22:45,740 --> 00:22:47,940
Despite her sweet looks though,

659
00:22:47,940 --> 00:22:49,340
she's not as young as you think.

660
00:22:49,340 --> 00:22:51,020
- How old is she?
- In her early 20s?

661
00:22:51,020 --> 00:22:52,750
I'm 26.

662
00:22:52,750 --> 00:22:54,140
She looks 26 too.

663
00:22:54,140 --> 00:22:55,680
(I'm 26.)

664
00:22:55,680 --> 00:22:58,320
That's exactly how she seems.

665
00:22:58,320 --> 00:23:00,260
Did you have
to make things awkward for her?

666
00:23:00,260 --> 00:23:02,380
He looks meaner in that outfit too.

667
00:23:02,380 --> 00:23:04,260
- That's not what I meant.
- Lady!

668
00:23:04,260 --> 00:23:05,850
- Lady, seriously?
- She's not 30...

669
00:23:05,850 --> 00:23:07,570
- Grandma!
- I would've been surprised...

670
00:23:07,570 --> 00:23:08,590
if she were 32.

671
00:23:08,590 --> 00:23:11,330
- What's wrong with her?
- Tell me about it.

672
00:23:11,330 --> 00:23:13,570
Yoyomi, I'm sorry about that.

673
00:23:13,570 --> 00:23:14,770
- Well...
- This is hilarious.

674
00:23:14,770 --> 00:23:18,670
I asked her to sing
"Third Han River Bridge" just now,

675
00:23:18,670 --> 00:23:20,370
but could you sing
about two songs more?

676
00:23:20,370 --> 00:23:21,510
- Two more?
- Yes.

677
00:23:21,510 --> 00:23:23,440
- No instrumental accompaniment?
- Of course.

678
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:25,780
Your agency wasn't prepared at all.

679
00:23:25,780 --> 00:23:28,050
(He's upset.)

680
00:23:28,050 --> 00:23:29,220
Hold on.

681
00:23:29,220 --> 00:23:31,260
- Lady, what's wrong with you?
- Seriously?

682
00:23:31,260 --> 00:23:33,850
- Just think about it.
- Who are you to say that?

683
00:23:33,850 --> 00:23:36,030
I hate that she's losing out
on a good opportunity.

684
00:23:36,030 --> 00:23:37,890
She's a mean old lady.

685
00:23:37,890 --> 00:23:40,500
Give her a snack to shut her up.

686
00:23:40,500 --> 00:23:43,770
It's a chance
to get herself noticed.

687
00:23:43,770 --> 00:23:46,070
You should worry about
getting yourself noticed instead.

688
00:23:46,070 --> 00:23:47,830
It's a chance to
get yourself noticed.

689
00:23:48,310 --> 00:23:49,570
- Right.
- Get yourself noticed more.

690
00:23:49,570 --> 00:23:51,930
I've already promoted myself
as much as I can.

691
00:23:51,930 --> 00:23:54,140
Keep showing your back to me
and I'll knock you out.

692
00:23:54,140 --> 00:23:55,840
Gosh, I'm sorry.

693
00:23:56,440 --> 00:23:57,780
- Stop it, all right?
- Jiang Chen.

694
00:23:57,780 --> 00:24:00,110
- Don't hold it in.
- I'll knock you out.

695
00:24:00,110 --> 00:24:02,790
Next is the actress
we haven't seen in 11 years.

696
00:24:02,790 --> 00:24:05,490
- Goodness.
- We should apologize first.

697
00:24:05,490 --> 00:24:06,580
- Right?
- Exactly.

698
00:24:06,580 --> 00:24:08,150
It's Jun Hyosung.

699
00:24:08,150 --> 00:24:09,960
- Goodness.
- Hello, everyone.

700
00:24:09,960 --> 00:24:11,760
- It's been a while.
- Long time no see.

701
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:13,730
For the first time in 11 years...

702
00:24:13,730 --> 00:24:15,390
Tell me about it.

703
00:24:15,390 --> 00:24:18,570
I'd first like to ask
how you've been doing.

704
00:24:18,570 --> 00:24:19,800
- I see.
- What have you been up to?

705
00:24:19,800 --> 00:24:22,240
I've been squeezing myself
and working hard.

706
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:23,270
Recently...

707
00:24:23,630 --> 00:24:24,630
a web drama series...

708
00:24:24,630 --> 00:24:27,750
They're all like that after
being in the industry for 10 years.

709
00:24:27,750 --> 00:24:29,980
What does she mean
when she says "squeezing herself"?

710
00:24:29,980 --> 00:24:31,480
After 10 years in the industry...

711
00:24:31,480 --> 00:24:33,140
It's nice to know they're human too.

712
00:24:33,140 --> 00:24:34,440
- Unlike her K-pop idol days...
- I love it.

713
00:24:34,440 --> 00:24:36,880
K-pop idols have to refrain
from saying certain things.

714
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:39,380
- Of course.
- They can't cross the line.

715
00:24:39,560 --> 00:24:42,030
Recently, I released
a song for my fans.

716
00:24:42,150 --> 00:24:43,150
- Really?
- A song?

717
00:24:43,150 --> 00:24:45,530
- It's called "Starlight."
- "Starlight"?

718
00:24:45,530 --> 00:24:46,560
"Starlight".

719
00:24:46,560 --> 00:24:47,890
I wrote it myself.

720
00:24:48,270 --> 00:24:50,540
Kyung-hwan, please listen
when others are talking.

721
00:24:50,540 --> 00:24:53,160
(Kyung-hwan, please listen
when others are talking.)

722
00:24:53,430 --> 00:24:54,570
(Busted)

723
00:24:54,570 --> 00:24:55,630
You're thinking about
your own interview, right?

724
00:24:55,630 --> 00:24:56,930
His mind is still on his sketch.

725
00:24:56,930 --> 00:24:58,130
It's because he failed at it.

726
00:24:58,130 --> 00:24:59,240
Stop thinking about
your own interview.

727
00:24:59,240 --> 00:25:01,400
I heard him say that
they should try again.

728
00:25:01,400 --> 00:25:04,020
- Was it obvious?
- Very.

729
00:25:04,020 --> 00:25:06,020
- I just hated the opening sketch.
- I know.

730
00:25:06,020 --> 00:25:07,550
I'm deeply upset right now.

731
00:25:07,550 --> 00:25:09,440
Don't worry. The viewers won't know.

732
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:10,650
Really?

733
00:25:10,650 --> 00:25:13,110
- They won't know?
- I'll pay attention.

734
00:25:13,880 --> 00:25:16,080
(Hyosung released "Starlight"
for her fans...)

735
00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:18,260
(to celebrate her 10th year
in the industry.)

736
00:25:20,120 --> 00:25:21,800
<i>You always give me the light</i>

737
00:25:21,800 --> 00:25:23,730
(To no instrumental accompaniment,)

738
00:25:23,730 --> 00:25:25,630
(she sings her heart out
for her fans.)

739
00:25:25,740 --> 00:25:30,430
Why is there no
instrumental accompaniment though?

740
00:25:30,930 --> 00:25:33,400
- What?
- Come prepared, guys!

741
00:25:33,400 --> 00:25:35,510
- How's that important?
- Just let her sing.

742
00:25:35,510 --> 00:25:37,640
I understand Yoyomi
since she's a rookie,

743
00:25:37,640 --> 00:25:39,250
but why didn't you
come prepared either?

744
00:25:39,250 --> 00:25:42,080
Must you brag about being signed
to a decent agency like that?

745
00:25:42,110 --> 00:25:43,610
We're all signed by decent agencies.

746
00:25:43,610 --> 00:25:45,220
Unbelievable.

747
00:25:45,220 --> 00:25:46,790
That was hilarious.

748
00:25:47,110 --> 00:25:49,260
We'll wrap up the sneak peek
of "Starlight" then.

749
00:25:49,260 --> 00:25:51,460
- I want to hear more though.
- Sing a little more.

750
00:25:51,460 --> 00:25:53,060
- Look after Hyosung, will you?
- Don't be like that.

751
00:25:53,060 --> 00:25:54,860
- She sang enough.
- She barely reached the climax.

752
00:25:54,860 --> 00:25:56,030
- Hyosung...
- We should...

753
00:25:56,270 --> 00:25:57,860
Could you do it again
if you're asked to?

754
00:25:57,860 --> 00:25:59,070
- Sorry?
- Your song, I mean.

755
00:25:59,070 --> 00:26:00,510
You should worry about yourself.

756
00:26:00,510 --> 00:26:02,130
What's wrong with him today?

757
00:26:02,130 --> 00:26:03,160
We were all thinking that.

758
00:26:03,160 --> 00:26:04,510
Stick to doing well yourself.

759
00:26:04,510 --> 00:26:06,830
I'm trying to do my best,

760
00:26:06,830 --> 00:26:08,400
- you know.
- You know.

761
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:12,780
Can we ask you to do
a voice impression of Kim Hye Soo?

762
00:26:12,780 --> 00:26:13,940
(He asks her on the spot.)

763
00:26:14,520 --> 00:26:15,520
(Out of the blue?)

764
00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:16,840
Madam Jeong from "Tazza"?

765
00:26:16,840 --> 00:26:18,560
- You're Madam Jeong today?
- Yes.

766
00:26:18,560 --> 00:26:19,850
I thought you were
dressed as my mom.

767
00:26:19,850 --> 00:26:20,850
(I thought you were
dressed as my mom.)

768
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:24,120
Your mom?

769
00:26:24,120 --> 00:26:26,120
- Haha's mom.
- She's dressed like my mom.

770
00:26:26,150 --> 00:26:27,620
"Get lucky this year."

771
00:26:27,620 --> 00:26:28,690
(Get lucky this year.)

772
00:26:28,690 --> 00:26:30,660
(She ended up doing
a voice impression of Haha's mom.)

773
00:26:30,660 --> 00:26:32,860
That's actually better though.
It's easier.

774
00:26:32,860 --> 00:26:36,540
I wish it had been
more entertaining though.

775
00:26:36,540 --> 00:26:37,870
- What?
- Hold on.

776
00:26:37,870 --> 00:26:39,600
- Was that your inner voice?
- Jae Suk.

777
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:41,050
You shouldn't have...

778
00:26:41,050 --> 00:26:42,250
- said it out loud.
- She's fine, you know.

779
00:26:42,250 --> 00:26:44,940
Why don't I just dance
to some music?

780
00:26:44,940 --> 00:26:47,250
We'll give you some music then...

781
00:26:47,250 --> 00:26:48,840
- since you're a great dancer.
- Of course.

782
00:26:48,840 --> 00:26:51,560
- Good luck.
- Goodness.

783
00:26:51,560 --> 00:26:53,610
No one is better than her
at striking powerful moves.

784
00:26:59,030 --> 00:27:00,620
(She's off to an electric start.)

785
00:27:01,660 --> 00:27:04,500
- Her moves are different.
- Exactly.

786
00:27:04,500 --> 00:27:07,070
(Their faces tell us
how good her dancing is.)

787
00:27:08,770 --> 00:27:11,330
Her expression changed
as soon as she started to dance.

788
00:27:11,580 --> 00:27:12,930
She sure is different.

789
00:27:12,930 --> 00:27:14,810
I love that move.

790
00:27:20,440 --> 00:27:22,250
(They all exclaim in awe.)

791
00:27:23,140 --> 00:27:25,520
Lucky her.
She's such a great dancer.

792
00:27:27,220 --> 00:27:28,380
(Her sexiness isn't something
everyone can mimic.)

793
00:27:28,380 --> 00:27:29,420
It's amazing.

794
00:27:29,420 --> 00:27:30,460
(Her sexiness isn't something
everyone can mimic.)

795
00:27:31,800 --> 00:27:33,260
(I'd love to try that too.)

796
00:27:33,260 --> 00:27:35,530
- No way.
- Isn't she good?

797
00:27:35,530 --> 00:27:36,570
She's amazing.

798
00:27:37,470 --> 00:27:39,240
(She commands the festival
with her dancing.)

799
00:27:39,240 --> 00:27:41,040
Jun Hyosung is back!

800
00:27:41,040 --> 00:27:42,160
She's so cool.

801
00:27:42,540 --> 00:27:44,040
- Welcome, Hyosung.
- You were incredible.

802
00:27:44,040 --> 00:27:46,040
- So...
- My goodness.

803
00:27:46,040 --> 00:27:47,810
Hyosung,
the good daughter and singer.

804
00:27:48,050 --> 00:27:49,580
- She's the best.
- No way.

805
00:27:49,580 --> 00:27:50,750
- That was the best.
- This move.

806
00:27:50,750 --> 00:27:52,140
I thought it was cool.

807
00:27:52,340 --> 00:27:53,440
This was my favorite move.

808
00:27:56,220 --> 00:27:58,020
- So Min, how does it go again?
- Show us.

809
00:27:58,060 --> 00:27:59,060
(I loved this move!)

810
00:27:59,060 --> 00:28:01,060
- Unbelievable.
- That move was incredible.

811
00:28:01,060 --> 00:28:03,380
It's hilarious to see her dance
in that disguise.

812
00:28:03,560 --> 00:28:04,960
You looked exactly
like the character you're playing.

813
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:05,960
(It was like watching "Old Boy.")

814
00:28:06,300 --> 00:28:08,470
That's how Oh Dae Su smiles
in "Old Boy."

815
00:28:08,470 --> 00:28:09,620
- Are you all right?
- Sorry?

816
00:28:09,620 --> 00:28:10,860
- Are you all right?
- What...

817
00:28:10,860 --> 00:28:13,360
- You're hurting.
- I'm only playing a character.

818
00:28:13,770 --> 00:28:15,040
Kwang Soo was injured.

819
00:28:15,040 --> 00:28:16,740
- No, I'm fine.
- Then go home.

820
00:28:16,740 --> 00:28:18,400
I'm good.

821
00:28:18,400 --> 00:28:20,130
- This is hilarious.
- He should go home?

822
00:28:20,130 --> 00:28:21,600
I should get rid
of at least one competitor.

823
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:23,670
I'm fine, everyone.
It's just how my character is.

824
00:28:23,670 --> 00:28:25,050
Right.

825
00:28:26,050 --> 00:28:27,110
Gosh, this is hilarious.

826
00:28:27,110 --> 00:28:30,380
Next, we have Heo Kyung-hwan.

827
00:28:30,380 --> 00:28:31,610
(Next up is the nervous
Kyung-hwan.)

828
00:28:31,610 --> 00:28:33,560
I'm back after a month.

829
00:28:33,560 --> 00:28:36,620
A month ago, you joined us
for a legendary episode.

830
00:28:36,620 --> 00:28:37,620
The one with the Coughing Ghost
and Clacking Ghost.

831
00:28:37,620 --> 00:28:40,060
I played an active part
in that episode.

832
00:28:40,060 --> 00:28:41,690
- What?
- It's why I'm back.

833
00:28:41,690 --> 00:28:45,690
You're now active as a member
of MAHEUN5.

834
00:28:45,690 --> 00:28:47,860
- We mentioned it that day.
- Right.

835
00:28:47,860 --> 00:28:50,010
- I even sang the song.
- But it was edited out.

836
00:28:50,010 --> 00:28:52,130
- That's right.
- It was edited out?

837
00:28:52,330 --> 00:28:55,600
The camera crane was used
to shoot the performance, but...

838
00:28:55,600 --> 00:28:56,940
It didn't properly air.

839
00:28:56,940 --> 00:28:59,640
Now that you've officially
released your song,

840
00:28:59,640 --> 00:29:01,790
let's see you perform it.

841
00:29:01,790 --> 00:29:03,940
Finally, we're seeing it
on Running Man.

842
00:29:03,940 --> 00:29:05,110
It'll be a first for me.

843
00:29:05,110 --> 00:29:07,110
- Me too.
- Finally, it'll be on Running Man.

844
00:29:07,110 --> 00:29:09,650
Make it fun so that
it doesn't get edited out.

845
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:11,350
We released the song as singers,

846
00:29:11,350 --> 00:29:12,500
so we're dead serious.

847
00:29:12,500 --> 00:29:13,890
I see. Show us then.

848
00:29:13,890 --> 00:29:16,620
(Because he's serious,
we're worried it wouldn't be fun.)

849
00:29:16,620 --> 00:29:20,160
(Will he be able
to grasp his second chance?)

850
00:29:22,900 --> 00:29:28,480
<i>Look at me,
is this the face of a 40-year-old?</i>

851
00:29:28,870 --> 00:29:31,410
I'm experiencing deja vu.

852
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:33,610
Why do I feel like
I've seen this before?

853
00:29:33,610 --> 00:29:34,880
- Was it in my dreams?
- Can you drag him out?

854
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:37,080
- Kyung-hwan, we have this footage.
- Drag him out.

855
00:29:37,320 --> 00:29:38,610
We have a video of you
performing that.

856
00:29:38,610 --> 00:29:40,650
- Even the angles were the same.
- We have the same footage.

857
00:29:40,650 --> 00:29:42,760
- Then play that footage!
- Also...

858
00:29:43,420 --> 00:29:45,120
- Can't you do better?
- Why won't you play it?

859
00:29:45,120 --> 00:29:47,120
- I mean...
- The pronunciation was off.

860
00:29:47,120 --> 00:29:48,160
(What's with the pronunciation?)

861
00:29:48,160 --> 00:29:49,230
<i>Look at me</i>

862
00:29:49,230 --> 00:29:51,630
- That's how he was like.
- Is it French?

863
00:29:51,630 --> 00:29:53,630
- My part sounded weak.
- All right then.

864
00:29:53,630 --> 00:29:55,540
Perform the choreography for us too.

865
00:29:55,540 --> 00:29:57,160
I have high hopes for the EDM remix.

866
00:29:57,360 --> 00:29:59,740
Let's do this.
Kyung-hwan, believe in the song.

867
00:30:00,100 --> 00:30:02,440
(The beat picks up
and they all get excited.)

868
00:30:02,440 --> 00:30:04,140
- Bring up the excitement.
- Here we go then.

869
00:30:04,140 --> 00:30:07,110
<i>Look at me,
is this the face of a 40-year-old?</i>

870
00:30:07,110 --> 00:30:09,290
(Seriously?)

871
00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:12,260
(His dance lacks creativity
and is old-fashioned.)

872
00:30:12,260 --> 00:30:13,580
Isn't that what he used to do
years ago?

873
00:30:14,790 --> 00:30:16,080
Wait.

874
00:30:16,180 --> 00:30:17,690
Why did they turn down the volume?

875
00:30:17,890 --> 00:30:19,060
Why did they turn it down?

876
00:30:19,060 --> 00:30:20,120
He did it on his own.

877
00:30:20,350 --> 00:30:22,500
- No one told him to.
- You're mean.

878
00:30:22,500 --> 00:30:24,770
- Why was it turned down?
- This is scary.

879
00:30:24,770 --> 00:30:26,360
The sound director turned it down
on his own.

880
00:30:26,470 --> 00:30:28,930
The dance was a bit disappointing.

881
00:30:29,430 --> 00:30:31,370
- It was disappointing. Hyosung.
- Yes.

882
00:30:31,370 --> 00:30:34,550
You're a great dancer.
Can you dance to this song?

883
00:30:34,550 --> 00:30:35,780
That sounds fun.

884
00:30:36,250 --> 00:30:38,720
- Do something powerful.
- Show us your version.

885
00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:40,080
Please play it again.

886
00:30:41,820 --> 00:30:43,050
This is more like it.

887
00:30:44,490 --> 00:30:46,650
(Yes, this is more like it.)

888
00:30:47,220 --> 00:30:48,790
(Kyung-hwan copies her
immediately.)

889
00:30:48,790 --> 00:30:49,850
It's the same song.

890
00:30:51,500 --> 00:30:53,420
(Powerful and sexy)

891
00:30:54,470 --> 00:30:57,270
(Kyung-hwan tries to steal
attention by singing.)

892
00:30:58,160 --> 00:30:59,800
This song should have been hers.

893
00:30:59,860 --> 00:31:02,860
Anyway, thank you, everyone.

894
00:31:02,970 --> 00:31:04,870
Can we see this on TV?

895
00:31:04,870 --> 00:31:07,370
- Can this air? Tell us.
- Please.

896
00:31:07,370 --> 00:31:09,010
- Please.
- Hyosung saved it.

897
00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:10,550
I'm relieved.

898
00:31:10,550 --> 00:31:11,670
- Hyosung saved it.
- I mean...

899
00:31:11,670 --> 00:31:14,080
All I did is dance, and you're
skipping three sheets of script.

900
00:31:14,440 --> 00:31:16,180
Does that mean you're skipping
questions for me?

901
00:31:16,250 --> 00:31:18,820
Unfortunately,
we have to wrap things up here.

902
00:31:18,820 --> 00:31:20,580
Why is it always unfortunate?

903
00:31:21,680 --> 00:31:23,120
- Ask him more questions.
- I don't have any.

904
00:31:23,150 --> 00:31:24,460
That's too bad.

905
00:31:24,500 --> 00:31:25,620
The interview with Heo Kyung-hwan.

906
00:31:25,760 --> 00:31:26,890
- Fail!
- Fail!

907
00:31:26,890 --> 00:31:29,770
Please let me be on the show again
in six months.

908
00:31:29,770 --> 00:31:31,270
All right. We're sorry.

909
00:31:31,360 --> 00:31:33,270
Now let's talk to actor...

910
00:31:33,590 --> 00:31:34,770
Kang Tae Oh.

911
00:31:35,430 --> 00:31:37,330
- He's so good-looking.
- He's handsome.

912
00:31:37,330 --> 00:31:39,100
He looks good even in that wig.

913
00:31:39,100 --> 00:31:42,400
You recently appeared
in the drama, "The Tale of Nokdu."

914
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:45,080
You've become a lot more popular
thanks to the drama, right?

915
00:31:45,780 --> 00:31:48,580
(He shakes his head.)

916
00:31:49,180 --> 00:31:51,320
(I'm not sure.)

917
00:31:51,320 --> 00:31:53,320
- He's honest.
- Then...

918
00:31:53,460 --> 00:31:54,830
Jae Suk is skipping one more sheet.

919
00:31:54,830 --> 00:31:56,420
Just say you have.

920
00:31:56,560 --> 00:31:57,850
Well...

921
00:31:57,850 --> 00:31:59,760
He can't lie.

922
00:32:00,560 --> 00:32:03,030
Tae Oh belongs to the actors' group,

923
00:32:03,270 --> 00:32:04,740
Surprise.

924
00:32:04,740 --> 00:32:06,540
- That's right.
- Seo Kang Jun...

925
00:32:06,540 --> 00:32:09,160
With Seo Kang Jun, Gong Myoung,
Lee Tae Hwan, and Yoo Il.

926
00:32:09,160 --> 00:32:10,470
- With Gong Myoung.
- Yes.

927
00:32:10,510 --> 00:32:11,900
Why did you do all this?

928
00:32:11,900 --> 00:32:13,480
In addition to acting,

929
00:32:13,480 --> 00:32:15,600
- you learned dance too?
- Dance?

930
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:17,480
- You said it in the interview.
- Well...

931
00:32:17,480 --> 00:32:19,370
I did learn it,

932
00:32:19,370 --> 00:32:22,990
but I'm not very talented
at singing and dancing.

933
00:32:22,990 --> 00:32:24,790
But the other guests danced too.

934
00:32:24,790 --> 00:32:26,650
- Show us a little.
- Okay.

935
00:32:26,790 --> 00:32:29,080
Just dance the way you want.

936
00:32:29,850 --> 00:32:31,090
This song?

937
00:32:31,500 --> 00:32:32,530
"Catallena"?

938
00:32:32,530 --> 00:32:33,690
("Catallena" by Orange Caramel)

939
00:32:35,030 --> 00:32:36,120
He looks so serious.

940
00:32:36,120 --> 00:32:37,230
(His facial expression changes
completely.)

941
00:32:37,500 --> 00:32:38,660
What's this dance?

942
00:32:38,830 --> 00:32:40,540
- That looks cool.
- It's a new version.

943
00:32:40,540 --> 00:32:43,210
(Left and right)

944
00:32:43,510 --> 00:32:44,710
It's new.

945
00:32:44,710 --> 00:32:46,540
It's classy.

946
00:32:46,810 --> 00:32:48,780
- It's very classy.
- It suits his outfit.

947
00:32:49,370 --> 00:32:51,110
(But...)

948
00:32:51,110 --> 00:32:52,280
What is this?

949
00:32:52,370 --> 00:32:53,610
It suits his outfit.

950
00:32:55,790 --> 00:32:57,760
- What is this?
- It suits his outfit.

951
00:32:57,880 --> 00:33:00,080
(Stiff)

952
00:33:00,080 --> 00:33:01,150
What is this?

953
00:33:01,150 --> 00:33:02,760
(Shocked)

954
00:33:02,960 --> 00:33:04,300
What is this?

955
00:33:05,090 --> 00:33:07,030
(He's extremely serious.)

956
00:33:07,620 --> 00:33:09,070
It looks so silly.

957
00:33:11,240 --> 00:33:13,860
(He's the new dancing machine.)

958
00:33:13,860 --> 00:33:15,330
I thought I was seeing things.

959
00:33:15,660 --> 00:33:16,860
(The dancing machine did
exactly what he learned.)

960
00:33:16,860 --> 00:33:18,240
I thought he was going
to smack the floor with his head.

961
00:33:18,670 --> 00:33:20,100
- I'm shocked.
- You're good.

962
00:33:20,100 --> 00:33:21,550
You went down this low.

963
00:33:22,550 --> 00:33:23,780
- I loved it.
- I was so shocked.

964
00:33:23,780 --> 00:33:25,320
(Unlike Kyung-hwan,
he managed to make everyone laugh.)

965
00:33:25,750 --> 00:33:27,990
- Tae Oh, I loved this.
- You're good.

966
00:33:28,580 --> 00:33:31,110
- Do it again to another song.
- The compression dance.

967
00:33:31,410 --> 00:33:33,650
It looks even funnier
because of that wig.

968
00:33:33,760 --> 00:33:35,080
It's funny because he looks serious.

969
00:33:35,260 --> 00:33:36,580
It was completely my style.

970
00:33:36,580 --> 00:33:38,850
On "X-Man", it would have been
popular for two months.

971
00:33:38,850 --> 00:33:40,390
- Can he dance to this song?
- It's a recent song.

972
00:33:40,390 --> 00:33:41,500
To "Touch My Body"?

973
00:33:43,120 --> 00:33:44,500
Good.

974
00:33:44,500 --> 00:33:46,660
- Here we go.
- He's getting started.

975
00:33:46,930 --> 00:33:48,470
He's warming up.

976
00:33:49,510 --> 00:33:51,040
He's so good!

977
00:33:51,580 --> 00:33:53,400
(The popping dance begins.)

978
00:33:56,140 --> 00:33:59,320
(The song has changed,
but his movements are the same.)

979
00:33:59,980 --> 00:34:01,110
Good job.

980
00:34:02,820 --> 00:34:04,520
(It's officially
the dance of the year.)

981
00:34:04,520 --> 00:34:05,680
That's so funny.

982
00:34:05,680 --> 00:34:07,880
- He's talented.
- He's amazing.

983
00:34:07,880 --> 00:34:10,260
- He's incredible.
- He's something.

984
00:34:10,260 --> 00:34:12,500
I haven't laughed because
of someone's dance in a while.

985
00:34:12,690 --> 00:34:15,900
So Min is showing an interest.

986
00:34:15,900 --> 00:34:17,330
(So Min's last target of the year)

987
00:34:17,330 --> 00:34:20,170
So Min is suddenly showing
an interest.

988
00:34:20,170 --> 00:34:21,270
(Jealous)

989
00:34:21,730 --> 00:34:23,270
- That was hilarious.
- You're incredible.

990
00:34:23,500 --> 00:34:24,630
Kyung-hwan...

991
00:34:24,630 --> 00:34:25,840
It's not going so well for him.

992
00:34:25,900 --> 00:34:28,770
- Try again.
- What's with your face?

993
00:34:28,770 --> 00:34:30,940
- He looks so unhappy.
- I just remembered something.

994
00:34:30,940 --> 00:34:32,610
- What's wrong?
- It's a family matter.

995
00:34:32,670 --> 00:34:35,250
- I mean, his dance...
- Yes.

996
00:34:35,250 --> 00:34:36,440
It shows that he took dance lessons.

997
00:34:36,440 --> 00:34:38,520
It's what you learn
in the beginning. Isolations.

998
00:34:38,860 --> 00:34:41,150
- That's what he did.
- You're right. Isolations.

999
00:34:41,150 --> 00:34:43,150
You look like a director
of a dance academy.

1000
00:34:43,980 --> 00:34:45,960
You look like a director
of a dance academy.

1001
00:34:46,690 --> 00:34:47,830
Her outfit...

1002
00:34:47,830 --> 00:34:49,730
- "Get lucky this year."
- "Get lucky this year."

1003
00:34:49,730 --> 00:34:51,730
- You look like a director.
- "Get lucky this year."

1004
00:34:51,770 --> 00:34:53,060
"I heard we have someone new."

1005
00:34:53,060 --> 00:34:54,360
(Director Jun discovered Tae Oh.)

1006
00:34:54,500 --> 00:34:57,060
Including Yoyomi,

1007
00:34:57,230 --> 00:34:58,580
you guys could do a show together.

1008
00:34:58,580 --> 00:34:59,880
(You guys could do a show together.)

1009
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:01,340
They look scary.

1010
00:35:01,500 --> 00:35:03,210
He should be included too.

1011
00:35:03,210 --> 00:35:04,380
No, not me.

1012
00:35:04,380 --> 00:35:05,670
- Go stand there.
- Not me.

1013
00:35:05,670 --> 00:35:07,080
- Kwang Soo should be there too.
- No.

1014
00:35:07,080 --> 00:35:08,540
- Come.
- They look so scary.

1015
00:35:08,540 --> 00:35:09,610
Join us.

1016
00:35:10,190 --> 00:35:12,880
- They look horrifying.
- We're Team Parasite.

1017
00:35:12,880 --> 00:35:13,960
(The interview is over.)

1018
00:35:14,250 --> 00:35:16,480
It's time to begin the race.

1019
00:35:16,480 --> 00:35:17,900
But before that,

1020
00:35:17,900 --> 00:35:22,020
let's watch a video prepared for
the Ggannes Film Festival.

1021
00:35:22,590 --> 00:35:24,190
Here we go.

1022
00:35:25,840 --> 00:35:27,360
- "Poor"...
- "Connection"...

1023
00:35:27,360 --> 00:35:28,460
- "Movie World".
- "Movie World".

1024
00:35:28,460 --> 00:35:29,710
Hello, I'm Kim Yoon Sang.

1025
00:35:29,710 --> 00:35:31,000
Hello, I'm Joo Si Eun.

1026
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:33,610
- "Poor Connection Movie World"?
- "Movie World"?

1027
00:35:34,230 --> 00:35:36,650
Asia's largest film festival,

1028
00:35:36,650 --> 00:35:40,020
Ggannes Film Festival, opened
in Sangam-dong, Seoul, today.

1029
00:35:40,710 --> 00:35:43,750
The opening was attended...

1030
00:35:43,750 --> 00:35:46,060
by the world's greatest
actors and actresses.

1031
00:35:46,060 --> 00:35:48,650
To celebrate
the Ggannes Film Festival,

1032
00:35:48,650 --> 00:35:51,920
two of Korea's greatest movie
directors are on the line.

1033
00:35:51,920 --> 00:35:53,520
- Movie directors?
- They are?

1034
00:35:53,520 --> 00:35:55,170
- They must be busy.
- They are.

1035
00:35:55,330 --> 00:35:59,060
So who are these movie directors?

1036
00:35:59,060 --> 00:36:00,560
Let's find out.

1037
00:36:00,560 --> 00:36:01,730
- Hello.
- Hello.

1038
00:36:02,060 --> 00:36:03,610
- Hello.
- Hello.

1039
00:36:03,670 --> 00:36:06,340
I'm the director of "A Hint to You,"

1040
00:36:06,340 --> 00:36:08,110
which will be released soon.

1041
00:36:08,210 --> 00:36:09,750
Hello, everyone.

1042
00:36:10,210 --> 00:36:12,250
- "A Hint to You"?
- "A Hint to You"?

1043
00:36:13,020 --> 00:36:15,750
Congratulations on the opening
of the Ggannes Film Festival.

1044
00:36:15,880 --> 00:36:18,360
I believe the festival will
be an encouragement...

1045
00:36:18,360 --> 00:36:20,880
to everyone
in the Korean movie world.

1046
00:36:21,560 --> 00:36:23,690
Can I add something?

1047
00:36:24,920 --> 00:36:26,230
Why did you guys
turn down our movies?

1048
00:36:27,150 --> 00:36:29,360
We've sent you
countless movie scenarios so far,

1049
00:36:29,830 --> 00:36:31,440
and you never said yes
to any of them.

1050
00:36:31,500 --> 00:36:32,590
Why did you guys
turn down our movies?

1051
00:36:32,590 --> 00:36:33,670
- What?
- What?

1052
00:36:33,670 --> 00:36:34,860
(The directors' attitudes
suddenly change.)

1053
00:36:34,860 --> 00:36:38,080
(We rejected your movies?)

1054
00:36:38,170 --> 00:36:40,400
- They suddenly changed.
- You've always ignored our offers.

1055
00:36:41,340 --> 00:36:43,670
Do you think you guys are the only
ones invited to the festival?

1056
00:36:44,150 --> 00:36:46,710
We'll be there too. Be prepared.

1057
00:36:47,170 --> 00:36:50,480
Especially you, the stuck-up
and obnoxious national actor.

1058
00:36:50,480 --> 00:36:52,460
I'll teach you a lesson.
I'm warning you.

1059
00:36:53,480 --> 00:36:56,360
(Serious)

1060
00:36:56,360 --> 00:36:58,860
(The national actor?)

1061
00:37:01,090 --> 00:37:04,590
That was the interview
with the movie directors.

1062
00:37:04,590 --> 00:37:06,670
Thank you again...

1063
00:37:06,670 --> 00:37:08,710
for the phone interview.

1064
00:37:08,960 --> 00:37:10,210
Thank you very much.

1065
00:37:10,210 --> 00:37:13,270
Thanks for watching "Poor Connection
Movie World." I'm Joo Si Eun.

1066
00:37:13,270 --> 00:37:15,150
I'm Kim Yoon Sang. Thank you.

1067
00:37:15,250 --> 00:37:16,480
They're among us.

1068
00:37:16,540 --> 00:37:18,710
- They must be here.
- They snuck in here.

1069
00:37:19,110 --> 00:37:23,020
So the festival is about
the movies we've turned down.

1070
00:37:23,020 --> 00:37:25,480
Why do you suddenly cut in?

1071
00:37:25,480 --> 00:37:27,690
- I've been cutting in many times.
- Many times?

1072
00:37:27,690 --> 00:37:29,330
This is the year-end special,

1073
00:37:29,330 --> 00:37:31,730
The 2019 Ggannes Film Festival:
The Uninvited One.

1074
00:37:31,730 --> 00:37:33,920
You're actors invited
to the festival.

1075
00:37:35,730 --> 00:37:38,400
Among you are two directors who
have been turned down every time...

1076
00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:40,190
because of their silly scenarios...

1077
00:37:40,540 --> 00:37:43,810
and one national actor
who is popular all over the nation.

1078
00:37:44,360 --> 00:37:46,440
- One person?
- If the actors find...

1079
00:37:46,440 --> 00:37:49,310
and eliminate the two directors,
they win.

1080
00:37:49,310 --> 00:37:51,920
If the directors find and eliminate
the national actor,

1081
00:37:51,920 --> 00:37:53,710
the race comes to an end
and the directors win.

1082
00:37:53,710 --> 00:37:55,520
The losers will be penalized.

1083
00:37:56,520 --> 00:37:58,250
Your mission bags
will be handed out.

1084
00:37:58,250 --> 00:37:59,480
Spread to different places...

1085
00:37:59,480 --> 00:38:02,190
and check your roles,
which are hidden underneath...

1086
00:38:02,190 --> 00:38:04,330
- the mini name tags.
- Our roles are hidden there?

1087
00:38:05,830 --> 00:38:07,420
- Get your bags.
- They're hidden here?

1088
00:38:07,500 --> 00:38:08,590
All right.

1089
00:38:08,770 --> 00:38:10,000
Underneath this name tag?

1090
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:11,230
(Careful)

1091
00:38:12,730 --> 00:38:14,040
(It's hard to tell.)

1092
00:38:17,460 --> 00:38:21,170
(Who are the two directors
and the one national actor?)

1093
00:38:22,250 --> 00:38:24,110
The first mission
where you can win hints is...

1094
00:38:24,110 --> 00:38:25,420
Movies through the Hole.

1095
00:38:25,520 --> 00:38:27,810
Three teams of four will compete
with each other...

1096
00:38:27,810 --> 00:38:30,380
- to get the most questions right.
- I'm good at this.

1097
00:38:30,380 --> 00:38:32,250
You'll choose a time point
in the movie,

1098
00:38:32,250 --> 00:38:34,020
and the movie will play
for 30 seconds from that point.

1099
00:38:34,020 --> 00:38:37,360
But you can only watch the movie
through a hole...

1100
00:38:37,360 --> 00:38:39,420
in one of the four corners
that you choose.

1101
00:38:39,830 --> 00:38:42,090
- I got it.
- We can't see the whole screen?

1102
00:38:42,090 --> 00:38:44,770
In every round, we'll count
the number of all the wrong answers.

1103
00:38:44,940 --> 00:38:47,860
And the winning team can flick
someone on another team...

1104
00:38:47,860 --> 00:38:50,060
just as many times.

1105
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:53,000
The final winners can receive
a hint...

1106
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:54,380
about either the directors
or the national actor.

1107
00:38:54,380 --> 00:38:56,540
- Now please decide the teams.
- The teams?

1108
00:38:56,540 --> 00:38:58,340
The teams are important.

1109
00:39:00,170 --> 00:39:03,210
(Team 1, Team 2, Team 3)

1110
00:39:03,210 --> 00:39:05,650
For the first question,

1111
00:39:05,650 --> 00:39:07,920
which corner do you choose?

1112
00:39:08,020 --> 00:39:09,960
- Let's choose the top-left corner.
- The top-left corner.

1113
00:39:09,960 --> 00:39:11,630
Then the hole will be
in the top-left corner.

1114
00:39:12,330 --> 00:39:14,900
- We can only see that much?
- It's too small.

1115
00:39:15,420 --> 00:39:17,130
Why is it so small?

1116
00:39:17,790 --> 00:39:19,230
(They can only see this much.)

1117
00:39:19,230 --> 00:39:20,840
- It's way too small.
- Seriously.

1118
00:39:20,840 --> 00:39:22,110
(They're so mean.)

1119
00:39:22,110 --> 00:39:24,340
- That's...
- It's too small.

1120
00:39:24,610 --> 00:39:26,170
If the hole is that small,

1121
00:39:26,270 --> 00:39:28,040
we'd have to watch it many times.

1122
00:39:28,040 --> 00:39:29,750
- And it'd still be hard.
- Choose a time.

1123
00:39:29,750 --> 00:39:31,840
- We have to choose a time?
- Last time,

1124
00:39:32,210 --> 00:39:34,610
we did well when we chose
about an hour in.

1125
00:39:34,610 --> 00:39:36,110
- Around that point.
- Exactly an hour in.

1126
00:39:36,110 --> 00:39:37,380
We choose 58 minutes in.

1127
00:39:37,380 --> 00:39:39,420
The movie will play for 30 seconds
from 58 minutes in.

1128
00:39:39,420 --> 00:39:40,460
Play it.

1129
00:39:40,460 --> 00:39:43,230
(The top-left corner, 58 minutes in)

1130
00:39:44,360 --> 00:39:45,860
I see an actor.

1131
00:39:46,860 --> 00:39:49,190
(A mustache flashes by.)

1132
00:39:49,330 --> 00:39:50,690
I know this.

1133
00:39:50,690 --> 00:39:51,690
(I think I know this.)

1134
00:39:51,690 --> 00:39:52,790
- Wait.
- I have no idea.

1135
00:39:52,960 --> 00:39:54,170
What's that?

1136
00:39:54,770 --> 00:39:56,170
- "SBS"?
- Who is that?

1137
00:39:56,170 --> 00:39:58,230
- Let me answer!
- Let him answer.

1138
00:39:58,580 --> 00:40:01,980
(The clip isn't even over,
and Se Chan wants to answer.)

1139
00:40:02,150 --> 00:40:03,150
I think I know.

1140
00:40:03,150 --> 00:40:05,380
(The only clue is the mustache.)

1141
00:40:05,380 --> 00:40:08,690
(Will he say the correct answer?)

1142
00:40:09,690 --> 00:40:12,020
"The Thieves".

1143
00:40:13,090 --> 00:40:14,790
You are right.
That's Lee Jung Jae's mustache.

1144
00:40:14,790 --> 00:40:16,690
- Really?
- That's Lee Jung Jae's mustache.

1145
00:40:16,690 --> 00:40:18,590
- I am 100 percent certain.
- He is right.

1146
00:40:18,960 --> 00:40:22,190
(Correct)

1147
00:40:22,190 --> 00:40:24,000
- I knew it. I knew it.
- Jong Kook.

1148
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:25,730
- It was Lee Jung Jae's mustache.
- Lee Jung Jae's mustache.

1149
00:40:27,690 --> 00:40:29,710
(This part of the screen was shown.)

1150
00:40:29,710 --> 00:40:32,540
- For goodness' sake.
- Sorry. Sorry.

1151
00:40:33,440 --> 00:40:35,080
I knew it.
It was Lee Jung Jae's mustache.

1152
00:40:35,080 --> 00:40:36,540
- Lee Jung Jae's mustache.
- You are good.

1153
00:40:36,540 --> 00:40:38,770
- You are good.
- It's before the police come in.

1154
00:40:38,770 --> 00:40:39,810
- Right?
- You are good.

1155
00:40:39,810 --> 00:40:41,840
Maybe they can see better
from that table.

1156
00:40:41,840 --> 00:40:44,090
We can't see much from this table.

1157
00:40:44,090 --> 00:40:46,650
- Hold on. Our location is bad.
- Seriously.

1158
00:40:46,650 --> 00:40:48,020
They would have been able to see
the top-left corner better.

1159
00:40:48,020 --> 00:40:49,860
Let's ignore this round.
They had an advantage.

1160
00:40:50,230 --> 00:40:51,900
(You want to ignore this round?)

1161
00:40:51,900 --> 00:40:52,960
Seriously. Let's ignore this round.

1162
00:40:52,960 --> 00:40:54,460
Don't be ridiculous.
We can't do that.

1163
00:40:54,460 --> 00:40:55,960
- You can't do that.
- Let's ignore this round.

1164
00:40:55,960 --> 00:40:58,670
- We didn't think this through.
- It was a practice round.

1165
00:40:58,790 --> 00:41:02,730
You wouldn't have gotten it right
even if you were here.

1166
00:41:02,730 --> 00:41:04,900
I have watched Running Man on TV,

1167
00:41:05,270 --> 00:41:08,080
but it's a complete mess in reality.

1168
00:41:08,080 --> 00:41:10,250
(It's a complete mess.)

1169
00:41:11,110 --> 00:41:12,520
It's usually worse.
We are pretty organized today.

1170
00:41:12,520 --> 00:41:14,270
You saw it correctly.

1171
00:41:14,650 --> 00:41:16,840
We are nearly the same
on and off camera.

1172
00:41:16,840 --> 00:41:18,560
(She figured out the atmosphere.)

1173
00:41:18,560 --> 00:41:20,090
Please pick a corner.

1174
00:41:20,090 --> 00:41:21,750
- Top-left corner.
- Top-left corner.

1175
00:41:21,750 --> 00:41:23,290
Give me the time.

1176
00:41:23,290 --> 00:41:24,460
- The time.
- What should we do?

1177
00:41:24,460 --> 00:41:26,090
How about 59 minutes?

1178
00:41:26,090 --> 00:41:28,690
- Really?
- We choose 59 minutes.

1179
00:41:28,860 --> 00:41:31,860
These movies aren't recent.
They are over a decade old.

1180
00:41:31,860 --> 00:41:32,900
That's right.

1181
00:41:32,900 --> 00:41:33,940
(Top-left corner, 59 minutes)

1182
00:41:33,940 --> 00:41:36,040
What is that?

1183
00:41:36,460 --> 00:41:37,560
- What?
- What is that?

1184
00:41:37,560 --> 00:41:40,130
- Is that the emergency exit?
- The setting is modern day.

1185
00:41:40,230 --> 00:41:41,480
Is that the parking lot?

1186
00:41:42,080 --> 00:41:44,110
- Is that the moon?
- Hold on.

1187
00:41:44,110 --> 00:41:45,250
- That's the parking lot.
- I don't think so.

1188
00:41:45,250 --> 00:41:46,420
I think it's
an underground parking lot.

1189
00:41:46,540 --> 00:41:48,190
What is that color?

1190
00:41:48,840 --> 00:41:51,250
What? It's the shoulder.
It's the shoulder.

1191
00:41:51,960 --> 00:41:53,290
- Who is it?
- "New World".

1192
00:41:53,520 --> 00:41:55,290
- Let me answer.
- What's the answer?

1193
00:41:55,690 --> 00:41:58,590
- They will get finger flicks.
- Can you guess from that much?

1194
00:41:58,590 --> 00:42:00,520
Don't talk about finger flicks
when I haven't even answered yet.

1195
00:42:00,520 --> 00:42:01,560
Kyung-hwan, say it.

1196
00:42:02,270 --> 00:42:03,420
"A Bittersweet Life".

1197
00:42:03,420 --> 00:42:04,670
All right.

1198
00:42:04,790 --> 00:42:06,090
- One finger flick.
- My goodness.

1199
00:42:06,090 --> 00:42:07,230
One finger flick has been added.

1200
00:42:07,230 --> 00:42:09,400
- I think I have an idea.
- Go ahead.

1201
00:42:09,400 --> 00:42:10,610
Let me answer.

1202
00:42:11,500 --> 00:42:13,110
"New World".

1203
00:42:13,400 --> 00:42:14,710
Two flicks have been added.

1204
00:42:14,710 --> 00:42:17,500
It wasn't "New World."
We're in trouble.

1205
00:42:17,500 --> 00:42:19,670
- It's impossible to guess.
- Is that it? Do we get to see more?

1206
00:42:19,670 --> 00:42:22,420
- Is that it?
- The next team chooses the time.

1207
00:42:22,420 --> 00:42:24,210
- 1 hour and 10 minutes.
- 1 hour and 10 minutes.

1208
00:42:24,690 --> 00:42:27,020
- We need to see an actor's face.
- That's right.

1209
00:42:27,110 --> 00:42:29,420
We should be able to see faces
at the top-left corner.

1210
00:42:29,690 --> 00:42:31,060
- It's a car.
- Car.

1211
00:42:31,060 --> 00:42:33,000
- Is that a car?
- Isn't it the rooftop?

1212
00:42:33,020 --> 00:42:34,330
Is it the rooftop?
I thought it's inside the car.

1213
00:42:34,330 --> 00:42:35,830
- The rooftop.
- What?

1214
00:42:35,830 --> 00:42:37,290
- The back.
- Someone with long hair.

1215
00:42:37,290 --> 00:42:39,230
(Someone's silhouette passes by.)

1216
00:42:39,230 --> 00:42:40,440
It was a ponytail.

1217
00:42:40,440 --> 00:42:43,130
Let me answer. "Oldboy".

1218
00:42:43,130 --> 00:42:45,770
- I think he is right.
- I think he is right.

1219
00:42:45,770 --> 00:42:47,040
No, no.

1220
00:42:47,040 --> 00:42:48,900
- I have no idea.
- This is bad.

1221
00:42:48,900 --> 00:42:50,440
- I am frustrated.
- This is fun.

1222
00:42:50,440 --> 00:42:51,650
- Let me answer!
- Let me answer.

1223
00:42:51,810 --> 00:42:52,940
"Inside Men".

1224
00:42:53,150 --> 00:42:54,810
- No.
- It's incorrect.

1225
00:42:54,810 --> 00:42:55,880
Four finger flicks have been added.

1226
00:42:55,880 --> 00:42:58,590
It may not be a Korean movie.

1227
00:42:59,290 --> 00:43:01,210
- It may not be a Korean movie?
- You should have told us sooner.

1228
00:43:01,920 --> 00:43:03,590
- It may not be a Korean movie?
- I have no idea.

1229
00:43:03,730 --> 00:43:05,560
- This is so hard.
- Seriously.

1230
00:43:05,790 --> 00:43:07,650
Why does the ceiling look familiar?

1231
00:43:07,650 --> 00:43:09,130
- I think it looks familiar too.
- Right?

1232
00:43:09,130 --> 00:43:10,420
I have an idea.

1233
00:43:11,130 --> 00:43:12,170
"Batman".

1234
00:43:12,170 --> 00:43:13,630
(The familiar ceiling)

1235
00:43:14,130 --> 00:43:16,810
The ceiling of the place
where he parks his car.

1236
00:43:17,110 --> 00:43:18,170
I am sure.

1237
00:43:18,170 --> 00:43:19,230
Let me answer.

1238
00:43:19,230 --> 00:43:21,110
"Batman".

1239
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:24,540
Please say the exact title.

1240
00:43:24,540 --> 00:43:25,710
"Batman Begins".

1241
00:43:25,710 --> 00:43:27,710
("Batman Begins" is incorrect.)

1242
00:43:27,710 --> 00:43:29,710
- Let me answer!
- Let me answer!

1243
00:43:29,710 --> 00:43:31,710
"The Dark Knight".

1244
00:43:32,590 --> 00:43:33,810
It's correct.

1245
00:43:33,810 --> 00:43:34,980
("The Dark Knight" is correct.)

1246
00:43:35,630 --> 00:43:36,690
(We gave them the answer.)

1247
00:43:36,690 --> 00:43:39,060
- We nearly had it.
- We nearly had it.

1248
00:43:39,060 --> 00:43:40,860
- We nearly had it.
- They are really good.

1249
00:43:40,860 --> 00:43:43,830
- The secret underground lair.
- We did a good job.

1250
00:43:44,590 --> 00:43:45,630
(This part of the screen was shown.)

1251
00:43:45,630 --> 00:43:48,840
They will hate you for it,
but that's the point of Batman.

1252
00:43:49,440 --> 00:43:51,270
He can be the outcast.

1253
00:43:52,440 --> 00:43:53,900
We were close.

1254
00:43:53,900 --> 00:43:54,900
It has been a while
since I watched it.

1255
00:43:54,900 --> 00:43:56,170
(Teasing and being annoying)

1256
00:43:56,170 --> 00:43:57,880
We got the answer.

1257
00:43:58,270 --> 00:43:59,920
Since five finger flicks
have been accumulated,

1258
00:43:59,920 --> 00:44:02,310
why don't you give 1 finger flick
that feels like 5?

1259
00:44:02,310 --> 00:44:04,090
- Should we do it?
- Yes. Pick a member.

1260
00:44:04,090 --> 00:44:05,380
Kwang Soo has a big forehead.

1261
00:44:05,380 --> 00:44:06,650
It's not like that.

1262
00:44:06,650 --> 00:44:08,380
You pushed your hair back
for the finger flick.

1263
00:44:08,380 --> 00:44:11,020
- They just did it for me.
- Se Chan is good at finger flicks.

1264
00:44:12,330 --> 00:44:13,920
- Come on out.
- Whom will you hit?

1265
00:44:14,130 --> 00:44:15,290
Hey, we are talking to you.

1266
00:44:15,290 --> 00:44:17,020
(Haha has his eyes on someone.)

1267
00:44:17,020 --> 00:44:18,770
Would it be okay
if we hit someone in pain?

1268
00:44:18,770 --> 00:44:19,840
(Teasing)

1269
00:44:19,840 --> 00:44:22,810
I guess we should pick someone
who is already in pain. Come on out.

1270
00:44:22,810 --> 00:44:24,730
Hey. I won't say your name.

1271
00:44:24,810 --> 00:44:26,270
It's you. Hey.

1272
00:44:26,270 --> 00:44:27,310
The man with a bandage
on his forehead.

1273
00:44:27,310 --> 00:44:28,900
Excuse me. It's you.

1274
00:44:28,900 --> 00:44:30,250
- Me?
- It's you.

1275
00:44:30,670 --> 00:44:32,650
You already have a bandage
on your forehead.

1276
00:44:32,650 --> 00:44:34,980
- He does look pitiful.
- No, he doesn't.

1277
00:44:34,980 --> 00:44:36,880
- Give him 1 finger flick.
- Give him 1 finger flick.

1278
00:44:36,880 --> 00:44:38,560
- You should hit this way.
- It would be too strong.

1279
00:44:38,560 --> 00:44:40,110
It's only one finger flick.

1280
00:44:40,110 --> 00:44:41,880
I have gotten
a finger flick from Se Chan.

1281
00:44:41,880 --> 00:44:43,330
My brain shook.

1282
00:44:43,330 --> 00:44:44,830
I got a bruise.

1283
00:44:44,830 --> 00:44:46,690
Just take it.
It's only one finger flick.

1284
00:44:46,690 --> 00:44:48,730
Se Chan is really good
at finger flicks.

1285
00:44:50,130 --> 00:44:51,960
I am the type to seek revenge.

1286
00:44:52,090 --> 00:44:53,500
- Remember that.
- How scary!

1287
00:44:53,590 --> 00:44:55,170
Are you trying to intimidate me?

1288
00:44:55,170 --> 00:44:56,170
Go ahead.

1289
00:44:56,170 --> 00:44:57,170
Sit down.

1290
00:44:57,170 --> 00:44:58,210
(Kwang Soo tries to intimidate
with his gaze.)

1291
00:44:58,210 --> 00:44:59,770
Remove the bandage. There you go.

1292
00:44:59,770 --> 00:45:01,000
My goodness.

1293
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:02,670
Are you getting this on camera?

1294
00:45:02,840 --> 00:45:04,770
- Do it from there.
- Can I do it from here?

1295
00:45:04,770 --> 00:45:06,770
- Go ahead.
- My goodness.

1296
00:45:06,770 --> 00:45:08,020
Here I go.

1297
00:45:08,020 --> 00:45:09,250
Should I hold the camera?

1298
00:45:09,610 --> 00:45:10,750
Hold his head.

1299
00:45:10,750 --> 00:45:11,860
He might move.

1300
00:45:11,860 --> 00:45:13,420
This is happening too quickly.

1301
00:45:13,860 --> 00:45:15,090
I will give you...

1302
00:45:15,880 --> 00:45:17,290
What did he say?

1303
00:45:17,960 --> 00:45:19,290
He said he will give me 30 dollars.

1304
00:45:20,420 --> 00:45:22,000
30 dollars?

1305
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:23,960
- Do it. Do it.
- Go ahead.

1306
00:45:23,960 --> 00:45:25,960
Here I go. I will lightly flick
your forehead,

1307
00:45:25,960 --> 00:45:27,770
put your bandage back on, and leave.

1308
00:45:27,770 --> 00:45:29,810
- Let's go!
- Okay. Here I go.

1309
00:45:29,810 --> 00:45:31,060
Let's go.

1310
00:45:31,060 --> 00:45:33,540
(People gave shocking accounts
of Se Chan's finger flick.)

1311
00:45:33,540 --> 00:45:35,750
(How powerful will it be?)

1312
00:45:35,750 --> 00:45:36,770
(Smack)

1313
00:45:36,770 --> 00:45:37,840
The bandage.

1314
00:45:38,880 --> 00:45:40,480
(It really wakes him up.)

1315
00:45:40,610 --> 00:45:42,420
(Shocked)

1316
00:45:42,420 --> 00:45:43,940
It hurts so badly.

1317
00:45:43,940 --> 00:45:45,880
- There you go.
- It was a light flick.

1318
00:45:45,880 --> 00:45:47,650
It was a light flick.

1319
00:45:47,650 --> 00:45:48,730
(If that was a light flick...)

1320
00:45:48,730 --> 00:45:50,330
- It hurts so badly.
- I heard the watermelon crack.

1321
00:45:50,330 --> 00:45:51,560
His head didn't crack.

1322
00:45:51,560 --> 00:45:52,690
It was a light flick.

1323
00:45:52,690 --> 00:45:54,920
The sound was terrifying.

1324
00:45:54,920 --> 00:45:57,420
Getting flicked on the forehead
made me pee a little.

1325
00:45:57,420 --> 00:45:58,840
(He still feels dizzy.)

1326
00:45:58,840 --> 00:45:59,860
(The wonders of the body)

1327
00:45:59,860 --> 00:46:00,860
Seriously.

1328
00:46:00,860 --> 00:46:02,810
It was a fascinating experience.
After I got flicked on the forehead,

1329
00:46:02,810 --> 00:46:03,810
(He reveals
his fascinating experience.)

1330
00:46:03,810 --> 00:46:05,230
a bit of it came out.

1331
00:46:05,230 --> 00:46:07,340
This is what people mean
when they say, "I wet my pants."

1332
00:46:07,340 --> 00:46:08,440
That's right,

1333
00:46:08,440 --> 00:46:09,540
Kwang Soo.

1334
00:46:09,540 --> 00:46:11,750
Kwang Soo,
if we want to see your revenge,

1335
00:46:11,750 --> 00:46:13,480
- we must save up the finger flicks.
- Okay.

1336
00:46:13,480 --> 00:46:15,440
- Let's give five wrong answers.
- Let's do it.

1337
00:46:15,440 --> 00:46:16,980
It's our turn, right?

1338
00:46:16,980 --> 00:46:18,090
(He flicks the table.)

1339
00:46:18,560 --> 00:46:19,610
(He practices like
it's the real deal.)

1340
00:46:19,610 --> 00:46:20,920
That was powerful, right?

1341
00:46:20,920 --> 00:46:22,130
That hurt, right?

1342
00:46:22,230 --> 00:46:23,420
I was so surprised.

1343
00:46:24,750 --> 00:46:26,520
Kwang Soo is annoyed.

1344
00:46:26,690 --> 00:46:28,960
I think my middle finger broke.

1345
00:46:29,230 --> 00:46:30,400
Seriously.

1346
00:46:30,690 --> 00:46:32,960
I flicked the table to practice
because I was angry.

1347
00:46:33,540 --> 00:46:35,270
I hit too hard by mistake.

1348
00:46:35,270 --> 00:46:36,860
- My goodness.
- My finger is shaking.

1349
00:46:36,860 --> 00:46:38,130
His finger is shaking.

1350
00:46:38,670 --> 00:46:40,610
His stupidity goes well
with the costume.

1351
00:46:40,610 --> 00:46:42,270
- I was surprised.
- He was surprised.

1352
00:46:42,750 --> 00:46:43,980
He hit so hard.

1353
00:46:43,980 --> 00:46:45,380
Please pick a corner.

1354
00:46:45,380 --> 00:46:46,420
We pick...

1355
00:46:46,420 --> 00:46:47,810
Top-left corner.

1356
00:46:47,810 --> 00:46:49,880
- Top-left corner.
- Top-left corner.

1357
00:46:49,880 --> 00:46:51,610
- Top-left corner.
- Let's do this.

1358
00:46:51,710 --> 00:46:53,480
- 35 minutes.
- 35 minutes.

1359
00:46:54,290 --> 00:46:55,290
(I will get this right
no matter what.)

1360
00:46:55,290 --> 00:46:57,420
35 minutes.

1361
00:46:57,420 --> 00:46:59,020
- 35 minutes.
- This is bad.

1362
00:46:59,330 --> 00:47:00,900
I will get this right
and hit him again.

1363
00:47:01,520 --> 00:47:02,960
This is scary.

1364
00:47:03,690 --> 00:47:05,090
- What is that?
- Let's do this.

1365
00:47:05,090 --> 00:47:06,090
What? Say anything.

1366
00:47:06,090 --> 00:47:07,500
- A gun.
- It's a gun.

1367
00:47:07,500 --> 00:47:09,040
It looks old.

1368
00:47:09,040 --> 00:47:10,340
The screen is shaking.

1369
00:47:10,730 --> 00:47:12,670
The screen is shaking.

1370
00:47:13,540 --> 00:47:14,610
(The resolution doesn't belong
to the latest movie.)

1371
00:47:14,610 --> 00:47:17,380
- The setting is ancient times.
- No, no.

1372
00:47:17,380 --> 00:47:18,980
- I see a utility pole.
- Let me answer.

1373
00:47:18,980 --> 00:47:20,020
"Tunnel".

1374
00:47:20,380 --> 00:47:21,920
- It's incorrect.
- Let me answer.

1375
00:47:21,920 --> 00:47:23,420
"Peppermint Candy".

1376
00:47:24,210 --> 00:47:26,060
- Okay.
- Let me answer. "The Terminator".

1377
00:47:26,190 --> 00:47:27,560
- What?
- It's correct!

1378
00:47:27,560 --> 00:47:30,860
("The Terminator" is an old movie
that involves guns.)

1379
00:47:30,860 --> 00:47:32,420
The same team can't answer
twice in a row.

1380
00:47:32,420 --> 00:47:34,230
- Let me answer.
- Let me answer. "The Terminator".

1381
00:47:34,230 --> 00:47:35,920
("The Terminator" is incorrect.)

1382
00:47:35,920 --> 00:47:37,000
"The Terminator".

1383
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:39,440
(They failed to steal the answer.)

1384
00:47:39,840 --> 00:47:41,000
For goodness' sake.

1385
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:42,060
(The producer fooled her.)

1386
00:47:42,060 --> 00:47:43,340
- Are you toying with us?
- Let me answer.

1387
00:47:43,340 --> 00:47:44,460
Are you toying with us?

1388
00:47:44,670 --> 00:47:46,210
- "Terminator 2".
- "Terminator 2".

1389
00:47:46,210 --> 00:47:47,210
("Terminator 2" is incorrect.)

1390
00:47:47,210 --> 00:47:48,770
- 4 finger flicks.
- We saved up 4 finger flicks.

1391
00:47:48,770 --> 00:47:50,310
Let's watch a little more.

1392
00:47:51,750 --> 00:47:53,080
There is a building.

1393
00:47:53,150 --> 00:47:55,710
- Is that the sea? What is that?
- That's not the sea.

1394
00:47:56,650 --> 00:47:58,150
- That's not the sea.
- It's really old.

1395
00:47:58,710 --> 00:48:00,810
- It seems to be an old movie.
- Seriously.

1396
00:48:00,810 --> 00:48:03,090
(Other than the movie being old,
they don't have a clue.)

1397
00:48:03,090 --> 00:48:05,090
Let me answer. "Memories of Murder".

1398
00:48:05,290 --> 00:48:06,830
- That's right.
- No, no.

1399
00:48:06,830 --> 00:48:08,520
- It has that vibe.
- The utility pole and...

1400
00:48:08,520 --> 00:48:09,770
- It does.
- It has that vibe, right?

1401
00:48:09,770 --> 00:48:10,790
Let me answer.

1402
00:48:10,960 --> 00:48:12,040
"Mother".

1403
00:48:12,840 --> 00:48:13,960
Let me answer.

1404
00:48:14,960 --> 00:48:16,900
(Se Chan's attempt
makes this man nervous.)

1405
00:48:16,900 --> 00:48:18,040
"A Taxi Driver".

1406
00:48:18,040 --> 00:48:19,880
(Se Chan's attempt
makes this man nervous.)

1407
00:48:19,880 --> 00:48:22,770
("A Taxi Driver")

1408
00:48:22,770 --> 00:48:24,210
- What is it?
- Let me answer.

1409
00:48:24,210 --> 00:48:25,480
(Thank goodness.)

1410
00:48:25,480 --> 00:48:27,440
Let me answer. "The Terror, Live".

1411
00:48:27,610 --> 00:48:30,040
You are naming every movie you know.

1412
00:48:30,040 --> 00:48:31,110
(They will go all night long
at this rate.)

1413
00:48:31,110 --> 00:48:33,210
- What is it?
- Each team will get one chance.

1414
00:48:33,210 --> 00:48:34,480
One chance.

1415
00:48:34,480 --> 00:48:35,480
You are naming every movie you know.

1416
00:48:35,480 --> 00:48:37,150
It's our turn
to choose the time, right?

1417
00:48:37,480 --> 00:48:39,830
I think the setting is in the 80s.

1418
00:48:39,900 --> 00:48:42,060
1 hour and 15 minutes.

1419
00:48:42,060 --> 00:48:43,590
Play the video.

1420
00:48:44,270 --> 00:48:46,560
- What?
- They are fighting.

1421
00:48:46,690 --> 00:48:47,960
What?

1422
00:48:48,360 --> 00:48:49,730
What is that?

1423
00:48:49,730 --> 00:48:52,000
- A coffee cup. A coffee cup.
- Do you see a coffee cup?

1424
00:48:54,310 --> 00:48:56,250
- It was red.
- Isn't it "Swiri"?

1425
00:48:56,250 --> 00:48:58,110
- Flesh.
- "Swiri"?

1426
00:48:58,110 --> 00:48:59,270
Let me answer.

1427
00:48:59,270 --> 00:49:00,380
"Swiri".

1428
00:49:00,380 --> 00:49:01,670
("Swiri")

1429
00:49:02,520 --> 00:49:05,150
(An old movie
with a gun-related action scene)

1430
00:49:05,250 --> 00:49:08,480
(Is it "Swiri"?)

1431
00:49:08,480 --> 00:49:09,690
("Swiri" is...)

1432
00:49:09,690 --> 00:49:12,420
(correct.)

1433
00:49:12,420 --> 00:49:15,090
(Suk Jin's team gets a chance
to give a finger flick.)

1434
00:49:16,130 --> 00:49:17,690
- "Swiri"?
- How did you get it right?

1435
00:49:17,690 --> 00:49:19,500
Tae Oh got it right.

1436
00:49:19,500 --> 00:49:20,900
- Really?
- Yes. Tae Oh got it right.

1437
00:49:21,040 --> 00:49:22,210
Do we get to hit someone?

1438
00:49:22,610 --> 00:49:25,540
(As everyone guessed,
"Swiri" was released 20 years ago.)

1439
00:49:25,540 --> 00:49:28,610
(The hostage scene on the street
provided a crucial hint.)

1440
00:49:29,250 --> 00:49:30,340
Do we get to hit someone?

1441
00:49:30,340 --> 00:49:31,610
(His eyes burn.)

1442
00:49:32,310 --> 00:49:34,380
(This is a disaster.)

1443
00:49:34,380 --> 00:49:35,750
We gave one finger flick earlier.

1444
00:49:35,750 --> 00:49:37,610
Let's count 5 finger flicks as 1.
Thus, 2 finger flicks.

1445
00:49:37,610 --> 00:49:38,710
Two finger flicks.

1446
00:49:39,310 --> 00:49:41,560
(This psychopath
wants to take revenge.)

1447
00:49:41,560 --> 00:49:43,360
He practiced a lot.

1448
00:49:43,360 --> 00:49:44,460
My goodness.

1449
00:49:44,460 --> 00:49:45,900
I will go to you.

1450
00:49:45,900 --> 00:49:47,830
- I will go to you. I am scared.
- Look at his eyes.

1451
00:49:47,830 --> 00:49:49,130
- I am scared.
- Look at his eyes.

1452
00:49:49,130 --> 00:49:50,670
I am scared, Jong Kook.

1453
00:49:50,830 --> 00:49:52,440
He is so scary.

1454
00:49:52,440 --> 00:49:54,000
(I had no idea this would happen.)

1455
00:49:54,290 --> 00:49:56,840
It's straight out of a movie.

1456
00:49:56,840 --> 00:49:58,710
Se Chan, you are a zombie.

1457
00:49:58,810 --> 00:50:01,630
You can distribute the finger flicks
among members.

1458
00:50:01,810 --> 00:50:03,340
"Reveal your forehead."

1459
00:50:03,340 --> 00:50:04,710
- "Reveal your forehead."
- "Reveal your forehead."

1460
00:50:04,710 --> 00:50:06,520
Hold on. My goodness.

1461
00:50:06,920 --> 00:50:08,650
Don't hit my eyes.

1462
00:50:08,650 --> 00:50:10,310
Wait. I'm scared.

1463
00:50:10,310 --> 00:50:11,590
Your eyes.

1464
00:50:11,590 --> 00:50:13,110
- I can't hit your eyes?
- Be nice.

1465
00:50:13,110 --> 00:50:14,420
(He's asking
if he can't hit Se Chan's eyes.)

1466
00:50:14,420 --> 00:50:16,290
- Your eyes are scary.
- I can't hit your eyes?

1467
00:50:16,290 --> 00:50:17,630
No, you can't.

1468
00:50:17,630 --> 00:50:19,250
- I can't? Fine.
- You look scary.

1469
00:50:19,590 --> 00:50:21,230
- Fine.
- Your eyes are scary.

1470
00:50:21,230 --> 00:50:23,460
Let's see your forehead.

1471
00:50:25,940 --> 00:50:27,560
(Thud)

1472
00:50:30,610 --> 00:50:31,630
One more.

1473
00:50:31,630 --> 00:50:32,900
- Who else?
- Am I done?

1474
00:50:32,900 --> 00:50:33,900
No, sit down.

1475
00:50:33,900 --> 00:50:35,710
(Nonsense.)

1476
00:50:35,710 --> 00:50:37,980
(Se Chan gets
the second finger flick as well.)

1477
00:50:37,980 --> 00:50:39,710
I'll be angry too.

1478
00:50:39,710 --> 00:50:40,810
Fine. Sit down.

1479
00:50:40,810 --> 00:50:43,110
- I'm a zombie. I can't feel pain.
- Stand.

1480
00:50:43,110 --> 00:50:44,710
- Stand?
- Yes.

1481
00:50:44,710 --> 00:50:46,610
- Are you hitting me? Can I sit?
- Do it.

1482
00:50:46,610 --> 00:50:47,610
- No, just stand.
- Stand?

1483
00:50:47,610 --> 00:50:50,690
This is better. Okay, here I go.

1484
00:50:52,090 --> 00:50:53,830
(Thud)

1485
00:50:55,830 --> 00:50:57,360
- Fine.
- Okay.

1486
00:50:57,360 --> 00:51:00,500
Let's do this. I don't feel pain
because I'm a zombie.

1487
00:51:00,500 --> 00:51:02,500
(They're so immature.)

1488
00:51:03,730 --> 00:51:05,670
I feel no pain at all.

1489
00:51:06,170 --> 00:51:07,810
How immature.

1490
00:51:07,810 --> 00:51:10,580
- All right.
- This is convenient for us.

1491
00:51:10,580 --> 00:51:12,270
It's just between them two.

1492
00:51:12,270 --> 00:51:13,710
It's three.

1493
00:51:13,710 --> 00:51:15,610
He looks anxious.

1494
00:51:16,210 --> 00:51:19,210
- Please get it right.
- Okay.

1495
00:51:19,360 --> 00:51:20,750
- Are you all right?
- Okay.

1496
00:51:20,750 --> 00:51:21,860
Are you all right?

1497
00:51:21,860 --> 00:51:23,420
Tell me which corner you'd like.

1498
00:51:23,420 --> 00:51:24,560
I think left is better.

1499
00:51:24,560 --> 00:51:26,330
- We'll keep to the top-left corner.
- Okay.

1500
00:51:26,330 --> 00:51:27,860
Tell me where you want to start.

1501
00:51:28,020 --> 00:51:30,130
- 1 minute 20 seconds?
- 1 hour and 35 minutes.

1502
00:51:30,130 --> 00:51:31,230
Play the video.

1503
00:51:31,230 --> 00:51:32,230
Let's go.

1504
00:51:32,230 --> 00:51:33,840
(I'm going to get it right!)

1505
00:51:34,060 --> 00:51:36,130
- It's evening.
- It's probably one of the movies...

1506
00:51:36,130 --> 00:51:37,810
we mentioned earlier.

1507
00:51:38,440 --> 00:51:40,440
- You can't see anything.
- It's dark.

1508
00:51:40,810 --> 00:51:42,080
It's all black.

1509
00:51:42,080 --> 00:51:43,380
It's nighttime.

1510
00:51:43,580 --> 00:51:45,110
This is only the background,
so you can't tell.

1511
00:51:45,110 --> 00:51:47,020
- It's just black. It's dark.
- It's nighttime.

1512
00:51:48,540 --> 00:51:50,610
It's darkness.

1513
00:51:50,610 --> 00:51:51,920
I have no idea.

1514
00:51:51,920 --> 00:51:53,020
Is this a horror movie?

1515
00:51:53,420 --> 00:51:56,420
Let me answer.
"Joint Security Area".

1516
00:51:57,250 --> 00:51:58,650
We'll keep watching.

1517
00:51:58,650 --> 00:52:01,420
Okay, pass. Please give me the time.

1518
00:52:01,420 --> 00:52:03,170
52 minutes.

1519
00:52:03,190 --> 00:52:04,830
Here's the 52-minute mark.

1520
00:52:04,830 --> 00:52:06,440
Halfway point.

1521
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:08,440
- Where's that?
- That's the Joseon Dynasty period.

1522
00:52:08,440 --> 00:52:10,130
- "Son of the General"?
- It's a historical drama.

1523
00:52:10,130 --> 00:52:12,210
- It's a historical drama?
- Look at the window.

1524
00:52:12,210 --> 00:52:13,580
- The pattern.
- Is it?

1525
00:52:14,340 --> 00:52:15,900
This is so hard.

1526
00:52:18,980 --> 00:52:20,310
(Something just passed.)

1527
00:52:20,310 --> 00:52:21,310
Hold on.

1528
00:52:21,650 --> 00:52:23,210
- Let me answer.
- Go for it.

1529
00:52:23,210 --> 00:52:24,340
- "The Face Reader".
- That's it.

1530
00:52:30,990 --> 00:52:32,660
Let me answer.

1531
00:52:32,660 --> 00:52:33,660
"The Age of Shadows".

1532
00:52:34,100 --> 00:52:35,160
This is not a Korean movie.

1533
00:52:35,160 --> 00:52:36,260
- It's not?
- It's not a Korean movie?

1534
00:52:36,300 --> 00:52:37,760
It's not?

1535
00:52:39,640 --> 00:52:41,530
- Please. I have to get this right.
- Let me answer.

1536
00:52:41,530 --> 00:52:43,660
Then 58 minutes.

1537
00:52:44,330 --> 00:52:45,700
58 minutes.

1538
00:52:47,240 --> 00:52:48,370
Wait. That color.

1539
00:52:48,370 --> 00:52:49,370
(Green?)

1540
00:52:49,370 --> 00:52:51,450
- Color.
- This movie...

1541
00:52:51,450 --> 00:52:53,550
must be really quiet.

1542
00:52:54,180 --> 00:52:55,990
That green screen...

1543
00:52:55,990 --> 00:52:57,280
(Where did he see the green screen?)

1544
00:52:57,280 --> 00:53:00,910
(A foreign movie
with a green screen?)

1545
00:53:01,180 --> 00:53:02,450
"The Matrix"?

1546
00:53:02,780 --> 00:53:04,180
- That's a good one.
- Good one.

1547
00:53:04,180 --> 00:53:05,430
- Good.
- Let me answer.

1548
00:53:05,700 --> 00:53:06,720
"The Matrix"?

1549
00:53:06,720 --> 00:53:08,030
("The Matrix"...)

1550
00:53:08,030 --> 00:53:10,720
(is correct.)

1551
00:53:10,720 --> 00:53:12,640
(While everybody is shocked,)

1552
00:53:12,640 --> 00:53:13,640
That was amazing.

1553
00:53:13,640 --> 00:53:15,870
(somebody is tense.)

1554
00:53:15,870 --> 00:53:18,160
Why weren't they jumping?

1555
00:53:18,740 --> 00:53:21,970
(They thought this was a historical
drama but it's a simulated reality.)

1556
00:53:23,510 --> 00:53:25,140
I won't lie to you, Neo.

1557
00:53:25,850 --> 00:53:26,870
That was amazing.

1558
00:53:26,870 --> 00:53:28,620
(The finger flick master
gets ready.)

1559
00:53:29,140 --> 00:53:31,180
(Come on.)

1560
00:53:31,820 --> 00:53:33,680
(Their fates have reversed
once again.)

1561
00:53:34,080 --> 00:53:35,180
How did it turn out this way?

1562
00:53:35,180 --> 00:53:36,390
There were 9 incorrect answers,
so it's 1 finger flick.

1563
00:53:36,390 --> 00:53:38,530
Is this better?
Is this direction good?

1564
00:53:38,530 --> 00:53:39,700
- He's calling you.
- Me?

1565
00:53:39,700 --> 00:53:41,600
Yes.

1566
00:53:41,600 --> 00:53:42,800
Hurry up. Go.

1567
00:53:42,800 --> 00:53:44,370
Please have a seat here.

1568
00:53:44,370 --> 00:53:46,570
I can't believe they got it right.

1569
00:53:46,570 --> 00:53:47,640
You're back.

1570
00:53:47,640 --> 00:53:48,830
- My hand hurts.
- What?

1571
00:53:48,830 --> 00:53:50,700
It hurts? It's okay.
It won't take long.

1572
00:53:50,700 --> 00:53:53,180
- I'm serious.
- It won't take long.

1573
00:53:53,330 --> 00:53:54,330
It's just one.

1574
00:53:55,180 --> 00:53:57,800
- Can I take this off?
- Sure. It's up to you.

1575
00:53:57,800 --> 00:54:00,010
They went back and forth.

1576
00:54:01,140 --> 00:54:03,080
I think he'll go at full power.

1577
00:54:03,080 --> 00:54:05,180
Se Chan was being nice earlier.

1578
00:54:05,180 --> 00:54:06,890
He pulled back only a little.

1579
00:54:06,890 --> 00:54:08,550
When you hit me twice,
you were happy.

1580
00:54:09,120 --> 00:54:10,180
I'll give you 70 dollars.

1581
00:54:10,760 --> 00:54:12,030
He said he'll give me 70 dollars.

1582
00:54:13,620 --> 00:54:15,800
(Even 700 won't be enough.)

1583
00:54:15,800 --> 00:54:17,470
Fine.

1584
00:54:17,470 --> 00:54:19,700
- Just do it.
- Grab your thighs with your hands.

1585
00:54:19,700 --> 00:54:20,760
- Do it.
- Let's do this.

1586
00:54:20,760 --> 00:54:22,260
- Hold your thighs.
- Go for it.

1587
00:54:22,260 --> 00:54:24,160
If I look like I'm in pain,
he'll be even happier.

1588
00:54:24,160 --> 00:54:25,430
Fine.

1589
00:54:25,800 --> 00:54:27,140
Listen carefully.

1590
00:54:29,510 --> 00:54:31,280
(Thud)

1591
00:54:32,140 --> 00:54:35,080
(Tearing up)

1592
00:54:37,240 --> 00:54:39,080
How do you do that?

1593
00:54:39,080 --> 00:54:41,180
- That was strong.
- Are you all right?

1594
00:54:41,180 --> 00:54:44,080
That was more like two.

1595
00:54:44,080 --> 00:54:45,350
That was two.

1596
00:54:45,350 --> 00:54:47,720
- You might be injured.
- That was good. Okay.

1597
00:54:47,830 --> 00:54:50,100
How many is this?

1598
00:54:50,100 --> 00:54:51,300
Two.

1599
00:54:51,300 --> 00:54:52,990
Good. He's okay.

1600
00:54:52,990 --> 00:54:54,930
He changed again.

1601
00:54:54,930 --> 00:54:56,010
(Look at Kwang Soo.)

1602
00:54:56,160 --> 00:54:58,140
When does this game finish?

1603
00:54:58,140 --> 00:54:59,930
- He changed again.
- I'm scared.

1604
00:55:00,430 --> 00:55:02,700
- Tangsuyuk.
- Here's the last question.

1605
00:55:02,700 --> 00:55:03,700
Let's avoid him.

1606
00:55:03,700 --> 00:55:05,780
Hey, you didn't need makeup.

1607
00:55:05,780 --> 00:55:07,240
- Does it look like makeup?
- Yes.

1608
00:55:07,240 --> 00:55:08,740
- Do I have makeup?
- Yes.

1609
00:55:08,740 --> 00:55:09,780
I see.

1610
00:55:10,510 --> 00:55:12,260
Please give me the time.

1611
00:55:12,260 --> 00:55:13,660
55 minutes.

1612
00:55:13,660 --> 00:55:16,260
55 minutes?

1613
00:55:16,260 --> 00:55:17,550
- Let's watch.
- Let's watch.

1614
00:55:17,550 --> 00:55:18,720
(They pick the top-right corner
for the first time.)

1615
00:55:19,550 --> 00:55:21,350
(Top-right corner plays.)

1616
00:55:21,350 --> 00:55:22,720
What is that?

1617
00:55:22,760 --> 00:55:25,100
That kind of atmosphere and feel.

1618
00:55:26,600 --> 00:55:29,330
(This is not a decisive scene.)

1619
00:55:29,330 --> 00:55:32,200
Somebody's going back and forth.

1620
00:55:32,330 --> 00:55:34,010
- This...
- Let me answer.

1621
00:55:34,240 --> 00:55:35,780
- "Sympathy for Lady Vengeance"?
- I think I know.

1622
00:55:36,580 --> 00:55:39,180
- Is she right?
- That's one finger flick, right?

1623
00:55:39,180 --> 00:55:40,240
One finger flick.

1624
00:55:40,740 --> 00:55:42,280
(The finger flick is more important
than the answer.)

1625
00:55:42,280 --> 00:55:43,390
Isn't that it?

1626
00:55:44,390 --> 00:55:46,080
- What is it?
- Somebody passed by.

1627
00:55:46,080 --> 00:55:47,080
Somebody passed by.

1628
00:55:48,160 --> 00:55:49,990
(Somebody passed by!)

1629
00:55:50,390 --> 00:55:51,990
- Somebody passed by.
- It was a foreigner.

1630
00:55:52,100 --> 00:55:53,490
Wasn't it a foreigner?

1631
00:55:53,720 --> 00:55:55,100
- Was he Korean?
- I'm not sure.

1632
00:55:55,100 --> 00:55:56,100
Let me answer.

1633
00:55:56,100 --> 00:55:57,220
"The Chaser".

1634
00:55:58,530 --> 00:55:59,600
This team.

1635
00:56:00,430 --> 00:56:01,800
Just give a random answer.

1636
00:56:01,800 --> 00:56:02,910
"The Battleship Island".

1637
00:56:03,600 --> 00:56:05,780
- One more.
- Give me the time.

1638
00:56:05,780 --> 00:56:06,780
(Gulping down)

1639
00:56:07,510 --> 00:56:10,370
(He's as thirsty as he's worried.)

1640
00:56:10,780 --> 00:56:11,780
It's our turn.

1641
00:56:13,080 --> 00:56:15,910
Kwang Soo. Let's smile.

1642
00:56:15,910 --> 00:56:16,910
What's wrong with you?

1643
00:56:16,910 --> 00:56:19,820
Kwang Soo, I'll get it right.
Give him the time.

1644
00:56:19,820 --> 00:56:20,820
59 seconds?

1645
00:56:20,990 --> 00:56:23,280
- 1 hour...
- 5 minutes.

1646
00:56:23,550 --> 00:56:24,580
Five minutes.

1647
00:56:24,580 --> 00:56:25,620
(He's exactly like Jang Kyung Chul
from "I Saw the Devil.")

1648
00:56:25,830 --> 00:56:28,530
Hey, I think you'll get a movie
for this role.

1649
00:56:28,530 --> 00:56:29,800
I have no time for it.

1650
00:56:29,930 --> 00:56:31,100
Hey.

1651
00:56:31,530 --> 00:56:33,030
(Top-right corner plays
at 1 hour and 5 minutes.)

1652
00:56:33,030 --> 00:56:34,030
Sunset.

1653
00:56:34,870 --> 00:56:36,070
I see grassland.

1654
00:56:36,070 --> 00:56:37,070
Grassland?

1655
00:56:37,700 --> 00:56:41,080
(This scene has grassland
in the sunset.)

1656
00:56:41,080 --> 00:56:44,970
(What movie is this?)

1657
00:56:45,180 --> 00:56:46,180
Let me answer.

1658
00:56:46,620 --> 00:56:47,640
"The Wailing".

1659
00:56:48,220 --> 00:56:50,080
That was plausible.

1660
00:56:50,080 --> 00:56:51,820
- I thought you were right.
- Come on.

1661
00:56:51,820 --> 00:56:53,180
Let me answer. "The Host".

1662
00:56:53,820 --> 00:56:54,820
Oh, my.

1663
00:56:54,820 --> 00:56:57,030
Let me answer. "Harry Potter".

1664
00:56:57,450 --> 00:56:58,490
No?

1665
00:56:58,890 --> 00:57:01,490
How many wrong answers have
accumulated?

1666
00:57:01,660 --> 00:57:02,800
- 9.
- 9.

1667
00:57:02,800 --> 00:57:05,390
It's 2 finger flicks
with 1 more wrong answer.

1668
00:57:06,240 --> 00:57:07,300
Please get the right answer.

1669
00:57:08,140 --> 00:57:09,600
I will.

1670
00:57:09,600 --> 00:57:11,870
Tree.

1671
00:57:11,970 --> 00:57:14,180
It's a forest, right?

1672
00:57:15,640 --> 00:57:18,450
(It's a movie with the night's sky
and the forest?)

1673
00:57:18,450 --> 00:57:19,470
What was that?

1674
00:57:20,370 --> 00:57:23,080
For your reference,
that was a decisive scene.

1675
00:57:23,080 --> 00:57:25,890
- Really?
- It's just the top-right corner.

1676
00:57:25,890 --> 00:57:27,760
Let me answer. "Twilight".

1677
00:57:28,320 --> 00:57:29,390
("Twilight" is incorrect.)

1678
00:57:30,330 --> 00:57:32,030
(Does Tae Oh have an idea?)

1679
00:57:32,030 --> 00:57:34,430
- Let me answer. "Twilight".
- "E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial"?

1680
00:57:34,530 --> 00:57:36,760
(I think you're right.)

1681
00:57:36,930 --> 00:57:38,300
- I think you're right.
- Let me answer.

1682
00:57:38,300 --> 00:57:39,600
(It's Tae Oh's turn.)

1683
00:57:39,600 --> 00:57:41,140
- "E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial".
- I think you're right.

1684
00:57:42,660 --> 00:57:46,800
(Is there a night's sky
and running in the forest?)

1685
00:57:47,740 --> 00:57:52,010
(If he's correct,
Kwang Soo can avenge again.)

1686
00:57:54,780 --> 00:57:57,180
("E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial"
is correct.)

1687
00:57:57,180 --> 00:57:59,160
(Roaring)

1688
00:57:59,160 --> 00:58:02,760
The scene was riding a bicycle
to the moon.

1689
00:58:02,760 --> 00:58:03,780
Two flicks.

1690
00:58:03,780 --> 00:58:06,990
(The scene was flying across
the forest in the night's sky.)

1691
00:58:06,990 --> 00:58:10,600
(There was only the background,
so this was a hard question.)

1692
00:58:11,260 --> 00:58:14,390
How do you go back and forth?
This is so interesting.

1693
00:58:14,390 --> 00:58:15,410
(Their fates have reversed
once again.)

1694
00:58:15,410 --> 00:58:18,370
Somebody is looking for you.
Please come this way.

1695
00:58:18,370 --> 00:58:20,740
I keep hitting him once
and getting hit twice.

1696
00:58:21,180 --> 00:58:24,240
I don't feel good
about Se Chan getting hit.

1697
00:58:24,700 --> 00:58:26,640
He's so strong.

1698
00:58:26,640 --> 00:58:28,470
- How did this happen to us?
- Kwang Soo.

1699
00:58:28,470 --> 00:58:31,080
It's more painful on the side
than the center.

1700
00:58:31,080 --> 00:58:32,550
There's a bruise.

1701
00:58:32,890 --> 00:58:34,890
There's a bruise.

1702
00:58:35,010 --> 00:58:37,160
- Like this?
- Wait. You'll hurt my eyes.

1703
00:58:37,160 --> 00:58:38,700
- What? I'll hurt your eyes?
- Yes.

1704
00:58:38,700 --> 00:58:40,200
(He might take a psychopath role
in the near future.)

1705
00:58:40,200 --> 00:58:41,600
I'll go for the eyes then.

1706
00:58:42,160 --> 00:58:43,660
(Thud)

1707
00:58:45,030 --> 00:58:46,030
(That was softer than Se Chan's.)

1708
00:58:46,030 --> 00:58:47,600
Se Chan was stronger.

1709
00:58:47,890 --> 00:58:49,570
- Se Chan is strong.
- That was weak.

1710
00:58:49,700 --> 00:58:51,370
- It doesn't hurt.
- He thinks it's unfair.

1711
00:58:51,370 --> 00:58:52,470
(He's possessed by a zombie.)

1712
00:58:52,470 --> 00:58:53,740
Keep hitting me. It doesn't hurt.

1713
00:58:53,740 --> 00:58:55,870
- That was weak.
- Is this the last game?

1714
00:58:55,870 --> 00:58:57,300
- Yes.
- You missed.

1715
00:58:57,300 --> 00:58:58,910
(Come out, Jong Kook.)

1716
00:58:59,320 --> 00:59:00,450
Is this the last game?

1717
00:59:00,450 --> 00:59:02,350
(There was a reason why
the psychopath asked.)

1718
00:59:02,350 --> 00:59:04,890
(He wants to hit Jong Kook.)

1719
00:59:05,350 --> 00:59:06,510
Thank you.

1720
00:59:07,010 --> 00:59:08,180
Thank you.

1721
00:59:08,180 --> 00:59:11,050
(Jiang Chen gets invited.)

1722
00:59:11,160 --> 00:59:12,300
I can't believe it.

1723
00:59:12,450 --> 00:59:13,700
My goodness.

1724
00:59:13,700 --> 00:59:15,530
- I can't believe it.
- Thank you.

1725
00:59:15,530 --> 00:59:17,160
Kwang Soo is insane.

1726
00:59:17,160 --> 00:59:18,660
(He is a true psychopath.)

1727
00:59:18,660 --> 00:59:19,740
I can't believe
he is doing this again.

1728
00:59:19,740 --> 00:59:21,260
I guess he held grudges.

1729
00:59:21,330 --> 00:59:22,530
That came out of nowhere.

1730
00:59:22,530 --> 00:59:23,910
(Laughing)

1731
00:59:23,910 --> 00:59:25,600
We won't play any games
that involve hitting today, right?

1732
00:59:26,470 --> 00:59:28,200
- Okay.
- You know,

1733
00:59:28,200 --> 00:59:30,550
Jong Kook absolutely hates
sudden moves like this.

1734
00:59:30,850 --> 00:59:34,050
- He is doing this again.
- Unexplainable moves.

1735
00:59:34,870 --> 00:59:36,220
Jong Kook absolutely hates those.

1736
00:59:36,410 --> 00:59:38,350
How did this happen?
This is rather strange.

1737
00:59:38,890 --> 00:59:41,120
Hold on. Your hand should be
on my forehead.

1738
00:59:41,120 --> 00:59:42,580
Why are you starting from afar?

1739
00:59:42,580 --> 00:59:44,050
I need to gain momentum.

1740
00:59:44,050 --> 00:59:45,120
(Must you ask?)

1741
00:59:45,930 --> 00:59:48,100
(He wants to hit hard.)

1742
00:59:48,620 --> 00:59:51,120
It's hard to understand him.

1743
00:59:52,390 --> 00:59:54,240
(Smack)

1744
00:59:54,760 --> 00:59:57,010
That annoyed him
without hurting him.

1745
00:59:57,600 --> 00:59:59,800
- That annoyed him.
- My goodness.

1746
00:59:59,800 --> 01:00:01,300
He hit me with his palm.

1747
01:00:01,410 --> 01:00:03,640
- He will remember this.
- Yes.

1748
01:00:03,910 --> 01:00:05,180
Of course, I will remember this.

1749
01:00:05,180 --> 01:00:06,370
Thank you.

1750
01:00:07,140 --> 01:00:08,350
I will remember this.

1751
01:00:09,490 --> 01:00:12,990
Team Jong Kook will get a hint
on the national actor or directors.

1752
01:00:12,990 --> 01:00:14,680
Our team did nothing.

1753
01:00:16,220 --> 01:00:18,680
It's your influence, Kyung-hwan!

1754
01:00:18,720 --> 01:00:19,830
I mean...

1755
01:00:20,390 --> 01:00:23,700
Choose between the national actor
and directors.

1756
01:00:23,700 --> 01:00:26,260
Come to us and we will give you
the hint.

1757
01:00:27,140 --> 01:00:28,640
- We need a hint on the directors.
- That's right.

1758
01:00:28,970 --> 01:00:30,240
That's the logical choice.

1759
01:00:31,140 --> 01:00:32,600
- Haha answered a bit late, right?
- Yes.

1760
01:00:32,600 --> 01:00:34,580
- It wasn't like that.
- He got caught.

1761
01:00:34,600 --> 01:00:36,180
- I had the same thought.
- Did you realize that?

1762
01:00:36,180 --> 01:00:37,350
(Could Haha be a director?)

1763
01:00:37,350 --> 01:00:38,970
Please come and check out the hint.

1764
01:00:40,240 --> 01:00:41,370
Which hint would you like?

1765
01:00:41,450 --> 01:00:42,910
- A hint on the directors.
- Come closer.

1766
01:00:43,390 --> 01:00:45,510
So Min looks so cool.

1767
01:00:45,780 --> 01:00:47,660
I hope So Min would wear that
regularly.

1768
01:00:49,720 --> 01:00:51,950
(Which hint
did Team Jong Kook receive?)

1769
01:00:51,950 --> 01:00:53,890
- My goodness.
- We know who the male director is.

1770
01:00:53,890 --> 01:00:56,120
(1 director is a man
and 1 director is a woman.)

1771
01:00:56,120 --> 01:00:57,300
- My goodness.
- We know who the male director is.

1772
01:00:57,760 --> 01:00:59,600
- We figured that one out.
- Seriously.

1773
01:00:59,600 --> 01:01:00,760
- Really?
- Yes.

1774
01:01:00,760 --> 01:01:01,990
They think it's me.

1775
01:01:02,410 --> 01:01:04,160
- All right.
- The hint is on their sexes.

1776
01:01:04,870 --> 01:01:08,510
(Who are the directors?)

1777
01:01:09,550 --> 01:01:12,640
There are 2 directors
and 1 national actor among you.

1778
01:01:12,640 --> 01:01:14,320
- I see.
- That's right.

1779
01:01:14,370 --> 01:01:15,890
I figured out
the identity of one director.

1780
01:01:16,140 --> 01:01:17,410
- Who is it?
- Who is it?

1781
01:01:17,490 --> 01:01:18,580
Suk Jin is a director.

1782
01:01:18,580 --> 01:01:19,780
Director Jee.

1783
01:01:19,780 --> 01:01:20,950
I won't watch his movies.

1784
01:01:21,780 --> 01:01:23,550
- I won't watch his movies.
- You will watch them.

1785
01:01:24,080 --> 01:01:25,330
You will watch them.

1786
01:01:25,390 --> 01:01:27,530
Every movie needs a director.

1787
01:01:28,220 --> 01:01:29,530
(Quiet)

1788
01:01:29,530 --> 01:01:30,720
(Glaring)

1789
01:01:30,970 --> 01:01:33,570
(Kyung-hwan makes
the laughter die down.)

1790
01:01:33,570 --> 01:01:35,800
Maybe Kyung-hwan doesn't suit
Running Man.

1791
01:01:35,800 --> 01:01:37,970
- What is the problem?
- He is usually funny.

1792
01:01:38,010 --> 01:01:39,510
- His hairstyle is the problem.
- To be honest,

1793
01:01:39,510 --> 01:01:40,800
- I never liked...
- His hairstyle?

1794
01:01:40,800 --> 01:01:42,180
my team.

1795
01:01:42,910 --> 01:01:45,720
- Really?
- We never liked you, okay?

1796
01:01:46,350 --> 01:01:49,010
Even Jae Suk couldn't give me
enough screen time.

1797
01:01:49,390 --> 01:01:51,180
- He watches with enthusiasm,
- Seriously.

1798
01:01:51,180 --> 01:01:52,550
but remains speechless.

1799
01:01:53,350 --> 01:01:56,550
Since when did you hate me?

1800
01:01:56,780 --> 01:02:00,200
Tae Oh,
why did you bring this?

1801
01:02:01,100 --> 01:02:02,890
(He is still carrying the spoon
they used to pick a team.)

1802
01:02:02,890 --> 01:02:04,760
I lost my chance to give it back.

1803
01:02:04,870 --> 01:02:06,800
He is carrying the spoon.

1804
01:02:06,990 --> 01:02:08,370
I recognize him now!

1805
01:02:08,370 --> 01:02:10,370
- What?
- He is handsome without a wig.

1806
01:02:10,430 --> 01:02:12,830
I recognize him now
without the wig.

1807
01:02:12,910 --> 01:02:14,010
Didn't you recognize him before?

1808
01:02:14,010 --> 01:02:17,200
- He looks completely different.
- Hairstyle matters.

1809
01:02:17,510 --> 01:02:19,370
When I said
he looked handsome even in that wig,

1810
01:02:19,370 --> 01:02:20,620
- it wasn't true.
- No, it wasn't.

1811
01:02:20,620 --> 01:02:22,620
(It wasn't true.)

1812
01:02:22,620 --> 01:02:25,390
(Their comment wasn't true.)

1813
01:02:25,390 --> 01:02:27,280
- He looks like a different person.
- I know.

1814
01:02:27,280 --> 01:02:29,030
(He still looked charming earlier.)

1815
01:02:29,030 --> 01:02:30,680
The two of you sat together today.

1816
01:02:30,780 --> 01:02:32,390
- It happened that way.
- It happened that way.

1817
01:02:32,390 --> 01:02:34,430
Hyosung was sitting
next to Se Chan earlier.

1818
01:02:34,490 --> 01:02:36,430
- So Min pushed her away.
- So Min's hat...

1819
01:02:36,430 --> 01:02:38,490
matches the color
of Se Chan's padded jacket.

1820
01:02:38,490 --> 01:02:39,970
- Se Chan.
- What?

1821
01:02:39,970 --> 01:02:41,470
Why are you sitting at the front
today?

1822
01:02:41,470 --> 01:02:42,870
I got on the bus late.

1823
01:02:42,910 --> 01:02:45,370
If it's going to be that way,
make an announcement.

1824
01:02:45,370 --> 01:02:47,600
- Don't be ridiculous.
- Hyosung,

1825
01:02:47,600 --> 01:02:49,010
did So Min push you away?

1826
01:02:49,010 --> 01:02:51,280
- No.
- I told her to scooch over.

1827
01:02:51,280 --> 01:02:52,780
Se Chan told me...

1828
01:02:52,780 --> 01:02:53,970
to go away.

1829
01:02:54,850 --> 01:02:57,890
(Se Chan's secret operation
is revealed.)

1830
01:02:57,890 --> 01:02:59,680
We don't usually tell the guests
to go away.

1831
01:03:00,550 --> 01:03:02,010
He says one thing and does another.

1832
01:03:02,080 --> 01:03:04,030
Se Chan wanted to sit here.

1833
01:03:04,390 --> 01:03:07,620
Se Chan stole glances at Hyosung.

1834
01:03:08,490 --> 01:03:10,890
Were you trying
to make So Min jealous?

1835
01:03:10,890 --> 01:03:13,430
In my opinion, Se Chan favors
women like Hyosung.

1836
01:03:14,640 --> 01:03:16,330
Se Chan favors women like Hyosung.

1837
01:03:17,410 --> 01:03:18,600
(The tumultuous romance
at the front row of the minibus)

1838
01:03:18,600 --> 01:03:20,240
- Right?
- My goodness.

1839
01:03:20,240 --> 01:03:21,680
I took one look...

1840
01:03:21,680 --> 01:03:23,240
and figured it out.

1841
01:03:23,640 --> 01:03:25,970
It wasn't about So Min.

1842
01:03:26,220 --> 01:03:29,850
He made So Min sit there
in order to stare at Hyosung.

1843
01:03:29,850 --> 01:03:30,950
It's not like that.

1844
01:03:30,950 --> 01:03:32,680
Se Chan doesn't compare to Tae Oh.

1845
01:03:33,080 --> 01:03:34,180
Right?

1846
01:03:34,280 --> 01:03:36,780
They are trying
to make each other jealous.

1847
01:03:37,050 --> 01:03:38,330
In the end,

1848
01:03:38,760 --> 01:03:42,990
Tae Oh and Hyosung will date.

1849
01:03:44,120 --> 01:03:45,330
(A handsome man
and a pretty woman will date.)

1850
01:03:45,330 --> 01:03:46,700
That's right.

1851
01:03:46,760 --> 01:03:47,930
- They look good together.
- That's spot-on.

1852
01:03:47,930 --> 01:03:49,200
- You attacked with fact.
- They look good together.

1853
01:03:49,200 --> 01:03:50,510
Hold on.

1854
01:03:50,510 --> 01:03:53,530
I like someone
who gives me a lot of love.

1855
01:03:53,530 --> 01:03:54,600
I see.

1856
01:03:54,600 --> 01:03:55,780
- Se Chan.
- Yes?

1857
01:03:55,780 --> 01:03:57,100
Can you give her a lot of love?

1858
01:03:57,410 --> 01:03:58,640
I am confident.

1859
01:03:59,180 --> 01:04:02,490
Let's go! Let's go! I can do it!

1860
01:04:02,490 --> 01:04:03,620
(He shows off his confidence.)

1861
01:04:03,620 --> 01:04:05,550
- "Let's go! Let's go!"
- Hey.

1862
01:04:06,010 --> 01:04:07,950
This isn't how you reacted
when they asked about me.

1863
01:04:07,950 --> 01:04:09,760
- Of course not.
- It's the honest reaction...

1864
01:04:10,050 --> 01:04:11,220
versus the fake reaction.

1865
01:04:11,220 --> 01:04:13,100
- Don't look at me like that.
- I'm not.

1866
01:04:13,220 --> 01:04:16,260
Kyung-hwan can't butt in.

1867
01:04:16,720 --> 01:04:18,570
- You know, he isn't...
- I...

1868
01:04:18,570 --> 01:04:20,800
as handsome as Tae Oh.

1869
01:04:21,160 --> 01:04:22,970
- He is caught in-between.
- I am single too.

1870
01:04:22,970 --> 01:04:24,160
He hung his head.

1871
01:04:24,160 --> 01:04:26,080
You never know
who women will choose in real life.

1872
01:04:28,240 --> 01:04:32,010
I prepared a simple mission to win
an additional hint.

1873
01:04:32,140 --> 01:04:35,680
You will get a hint on the directors
if all members succeed.

1874
01:04:36,220 --> 01:04:37,640
That means it's impossible.

1875
01:04:37,640 --> 01:04:40,010
- It's impossible.
- It will be really hard.

1876
01:04:40,010 --> 01:04:42,350
The mission is the Upgraded 3, 6, 9.

1877
01:04:42,350 --> 01:04:43,550
It's 3, 6, 9.

1878
01:04:43,580 --> 01:04:45,620
Play a game of 3, 6, 9.

1879
01:04:45,620 --> 01:04:47,330
- You succeed when you reach 40.
- 40?

1880
01:04:47,930 --> 01:04:50,300
When the number contains
3, 6, or 9,

1881
01:04:50,300 --> 01:04:52,970
say a word that fits
the given category.

1882
01:04:52,970 --> 01:04:54,970
Let's say the category is fruits.
1, 2, pear,

1883
01:04:54,970 --> 01:04:56,870
4, 5, strawberry...
It will go like that.

1884
01:04:56,870 --> 01:04:59,510
- They are good.
- Is there a lab for the games?

1885
01:04:59,740 --> 01:05:00,870
A lab for the games.

1886
01:05:00,910 --> 01:05:02,510
It will get really confusing
after 30.

1887
01:05:03,050 --> 01:05:04,470
- We can't repeat a word.
- You can't repeat a word.

1888
01:05:04,470 --> 01:05:05,550
This is so hard.

1889
01:05:05,550 --> 01:05:06,680
If the number is 33,

1890
01:05:06,680 --> 01:05:08,220
you must say, "Strawberry, pear."
Say two words.

1891
01:05:08,220 --> 01:05:10,280
- You can't pick the same word.
- Two different fruits.

1892
01:05:11,050 --> 01:05:13,260
Make sure you remember.

1893
01:05:13,720 --> 01:05:16,780
If the number is 33,
you must say, "Strawberry, pear."

1894
01:05:16,780 --> 01:05:18,180
(If the number is 33,
you must say, "Strawberry, pear.")

1895
01:05:18,280 --> 01:05:20,450
- We know that.
- He just said the same thing.

1896
01:05:20,700 --> 01:05:22,430
- He just said the same thing.
- Seriously.

1897
01:05:22,570 --> 01:05:25,330
I was simply reminding you.

1898
01:05:25,390 --> 01:05:26,600
You didn't know.

1899
01:05:26,600 --> 01:05:28,200
- Did you know?
- Suk Jin, I know. I know.

1900
01:05:28,760 --> 01:05:30,010
- Okay, Jae Suk.
- Suk Jin, I get the game.

1901
01:05:30,100 --> 01:05:33,140
When the number is a multiple of 10,
yell, "Hurray."

1902
01:05:33,140 --> 01:05:34,830
- What?
- How many rules are there?

1903
01:05:34,830 --> 01:05:36,140
- A multiple of 10?
- This is too hard.

1904
01:05:36,200 --> 01:05:38,470
Suk Jin will go first.
Go from Hyosung to Jong Kook.

1905
01:05:38,470 --> 01:05:40,510
Then go from Ji Hyo to Jae Suk.

1906
01:05:40,510 --> 01:05:41,740
That's the order.

1907
01:05:41,870 --> 01:05:43,120
What do we do when the number is 30?

1908
01:05:43,120 --> 01:05:44,240
What do we do at 30?

1909
01:05:44,240 --> 01:05:46,660
- "Hurray."
- Say, "Hurray."

1910
01:05:46,660 --> 01:05:47,890
How many times
do we need to tell you?

1911
01:05:47,890 --> 01:05:49,010
(Yelling)

1912
01:05:49,010 --> 01:05:50,550
- Suk Jin.
- Listen more carefully.

1913
01:05:50,930 --> 01:05:52,030
Suk Jin.

1914
01:05:52,160 --> 01:05:54,830
- Suk Jin, come on.
- Suk Jin, don't be angry.

1915
01:05:54,950 --> 01:05:56,430
The category is...

1916
01:05:56,430 --> 01:05:57,490
- animals.
- Animals.

1917
01:05:57,490 --> 01:05:58,700
- Let's begin.
- Animals.

1918
01:05:58,700 --> 01:06:00,870
<i>- 3, 6, 9
- 3, 6, 9</i>

1919
01:06:00,870 --> 01:06:01,930
- 1.
- 2.

1920
01:06:01,930 --> 01:06:03,260
- Giraffe.
- Four.

1921
01:06:03,260 --> 01:06:05,200
- Five.
- Chicken.

1922
01:06:05,200 --> 01:06:06,330
- 7.
- 8.

1923
01:06:06,330 --> 01:06:07,370
Snake.

1924
01:06:07,370 --> 01:06:08,410
- Eight.
- Snake.

1925
01:06:08,410 --> 01:06:10,580
- Hurray!
- Hurray!

1926
01:06:10,850 --> 01:06:13,510
- 11.
- 12.

1927
01:06:14,450 --> 01:06:15,990
(Suk Jin doesn't answer.)

1928
01:06:15,990 --> 01:06:17,550
- What are you doing?
- You are next.

1929
01:06:17,550 --> 01:06:18,680
- Didn't you go 1st?
- No, you went 1st.

1930
01:06:18,680 --> 01:06:21,890
(Did he alter his memory?)

1931
01:06:21,950 --> 01:06:24,280
- Don't make it so obvious.
- Director Jee.

1932
01:06:24,350 --> 01:06:26,850
Had you been younger than me,
I would have punched you.

1933
01:06:28,030 --> 01:06:30,930
(A punch of love
for better game-playing)

1934
01:06:30,930 --> 01:06:32,390
- I am serious.
- I wouldn't have sat still.

1935
01:06:32,390 --> 01:06:35,260
This just makes no sense.

1936
01:06:35,260 --> 01:06:37,070
- Suk Jin, come to your senses.
- Okay.

1937
01:06:37,070 --> 01:06:38,370
- Okay, I will.
- Suk Jin, come to your senses.

1938
01:06:38,370 --> 01:06:39,870
Suk Jin, let's go.

1939
01:06:39,870 --> 01:06:41,740
- You should go first.
- Okay.

1940
01:06:41,910 --> 01:06:44,600
- Go from Hyosung to Jong Kook.
- Okay.

1941
01:06:44,640 --> 01:06:46,350
The category is country names.

1942
01:06:46,510 --> 01:06:47,850
- Let's begin.
- It's easy.

1943
01:06:47,850 --> 01:06:50,050
<i>- 3, 6, 9
- 3, 6, 9</i>

1944
01:06:50,050 --> 01:06:51,680
- 1.
- 2.

1945
01:06:51,680 --> 01:06:53,120
Republic of Korea.

1946
01:06:53,120 --> 01:06:54,890
(Yoyomi needs to say "4.")

1947
01:06:54,890 --> 01:06:57,160
- 4.
- 4!

1948
01:06:57,220 --> 01:06:58,450
Yoyomi.

1949
01:06:58,850 --> 01:07:00,030
It was an easy one.

1950
01:07:00,030 --> 01:07:03,100
- No, no, no. My brain froze.
- Yoyomi.

1951
01:07:03,100 --> 01:07:04,390
- No, no.
- That was so awkward.

1952
01:07:04,390 --> 01:07:06,260
- No, no, no.
- Yoyomi.

1953
01:07:06,260 --> 01:07:07,330
- That was so awkward.
- Suddenly...

1954
01:07:07,330 --> 01:07:09,370
- No. I was in a daze.
- Yoyomi.

1955
01:07:09,370 --> 01:07:10,830
- Please pull this down.
- Yoyomi.

1956
01:07:11,430 --> 01:07:13,140
- Please pull this down.
- I wasn't paying attention.

1957
01:07:13,510 --> 01:07:14,640
Isn't it hot in here?

1958
01:07:14,640 --> 01:07:16,680
(Suk Jin takes off
his padded jacket.)

1959
01:07:16,680 --> 01:07:19,950
(Se Chan pulls it back up.)

1960
01:07:20,620 --> 01:07:21,950
(Why are you putting it back on me?)

1961
01:07:21,950 --> 01:07:23,890
- I am hot!
- All right.

1962
01:07:23,890 --> 01:07:25,320
- Pull it down.
- Suk Jin.

1963
01:07:25,510 --> 01:07:27,850
- Suk Jin is hot.
- I am hot.

1964
01:07:27,850 --> 01:07:29,160
Suk Jin, it's andropause.

1965
01:07:29,160 --> 01:07:30,330
Andropause!

1966
01:07:30,330 --> 01:07:32,530
(He is experiencing
hormonal imbalances.)

1967
01:07:33,830 --> 01:07:36,030
- It's andropause.
- Suk Jin is hot.

1968
01:07:36,030 --> 01:07:37,200
I am so hot.

1969
01:07:37,200 --> 01:07:39,640
When I asked Se Chan to take it off,
he put it back on me.

1970
01:07:39,640 --> 01:07:40,870
This isn't working out.

1971
01:07:40,870 --> 01:07:42,240
Take out the rule
about the multiples of 10.

1972
01:07:42,300 --> 01:07:44,100
- We will take out that rule.
- Okay.

1973
01:07:44,100 --> 01:07:46,010
- You mean the rule about "Hurray."
- We don't need to say, "Hurray."

1974
01:07:46,010 --> 01:07:48,280
- You don't need to say it.
- It's wrong if you say it.

1975
01:07:48,280 --> 01:07:50,140
Then we say a word for 30, right?

1976
01:07:50,140 --> 01:07:51,470
- Quiet down.
- What?

1977
01:07:51,800 --> 01:07:53,180
(Kwang Soo is asked to quiet down.)

1978
01:07:53,180 --> 01:07:55,080
Quiet down.
We need to focus on the game.

1979
01:07:55,280 --> 01:07:57,180
This time,
we will start from Kwang Soo.

1980
01:07:57,850 --> 01:07:59,120
The category is famous foreigners.

1981
01:07:59,120 --> 01:08:00,660
- Famous foreigners?
- Let's go.

1982
01:08:00,850 --> 01:08:01,990
Famous foreigners?

1983
01:08:01,990 --> 01:08:03,390
The only one he knows is
Alexander Graham Bell.

1984
01:08:03,490 --> 01:08:05,550
<i>- 3, 6, 9</i>
- Leave Bell for me!

1985
01:08:05,550 --> 01:08:06,890
- 1.
- 2.

1986
01:08:06,890 --> 01:08:08,390
Bell.

1987
01:08:08,490 --> 01:08:09,660
- 4.
- 5.

1988
01:08:09,660 --> 01:08:10,700
Bell.

1989
01:08:10,700 --> 01:08:11,720
(Bell is the only one I know.)

1990
01:08:11,720 --> 01:08:12,800
Edison.

1991
01:08:12,800 --> 01:08:13,870
- 7.
- 8.

1992
01:08:13,870 --> 01:08:15,640
(Who else is there?)

1993
01:08:15,640 --> 01:08:16,870
- Se Chan.
- That was awkward.

1994
01:08:16,870 --> 01:08:18,530
I told you to leave Bell for me!

1995
01:08:18,600 --> 01:08:20,030
There is Helen Keller.

1996
01:08:20,370 --> 01:08:22,430
- Nightingale.
- Marie Curie.

1997
01:08:22,510 --> 01:08:23,680
Marie Curie.

1998
01:08:23,680 --> 01:08:24,910
There is Marie Curie.

1999
01:08:24,910 --> 01:08:27,080
- Does Napoleon count?
- Of course, he does.

2000
01:08:27,240 --> 01:08:28,280
Douglas MacArthur.

2001
01:08:28,280 --> 01:08:30,540
Why did you say Bell
when Se Chan asked you not to?

2002
01:08:30,540 --> 01:08:32,420
- This is impossible.
- I didn't hear him.

2003
01:08:32,420 --> 01:08:34,460
(Ji Hyo could be a director
who wants to thwart their plans.)

2004
01:08:34,460 --> 01:08:36,460
- Jae Suk, go first.
- Jae Suk.

2005
01:08:36,660 --> 01:08:37,850
(Surprised)

2006
01:08:38,030 --> 01:08:39,130
Why are you nervous?

2007
01:08:39,220 --> 01:08:40,790
Why are you nervous?
We haven't even begun.

2008
01:08:40,850 --> 01:08:42,350
- Am I going first?
- He is nervous.

2009
01:08:42,350 --> 01:08:43,570
- Okay.
- All right.

2010
01:08:43,570 --> 01:08:45,530
The category is Korean movies.

2011
01:08:45,530 --> 01:08:46,700
- Movies.
- Movies.

2012
01:08:46,700 --> 01:08:48,200
Let's begin.

2013
01:08:48,200 --> 01:08:50,340
<i>- 3, 6, 9
- 3, 6, 9</i>

2014
01:08:50,340 --> 01:08:51,600
- 1.
- 2.

2015
01:08:51,630 --> 01:08:53,470
"Poke..."

2016
01:08:53,500 --> 01:08:55,740
"Poke..." "Pokemon".

2017
01:08:57,100 --> 01:08:58,100
What was that?

2018
01:08:58,100 --> 01:08:59,670
- There are so many movies.
- My bad.

2019
01:08:59,670 --> 01:09:01,750
- That was so random.
- What was that, Tae Oh?

2020
01:09:01,750 --> 01:09:03,380
I felt the pressure.

2021
01:09:03,380 --> 01:09:05,640
There are so many Korean movies.

2022
01:09:05,820 --> 01:09:09,380
That was kind of strange, right?

2023
01:09:09,380 --> 01:09:11,630
(Staring)

2024
01:09:11,630 --> 01:09:14,420
Haha wasn't talking,
and he just did.

2025
01:09:15,250 --> 01:09:16,330
(Jong Kook is fixed on Haha today.)

2026
01:09:16,330 --> 01:09:18,500
- You said you're not suspicious.
- You said you're not.

2027
01:09:18,500 --> 01:09:19,740
You're the director in his heart.

2028
01:09:19,740 --> 01:09:21,070
Has it already been decided?

2029
01:09:21,070 --> 01:09:23,430
If he says something,
he might get questioned,

2030
01:09:23,430 --> 01:09:25,570
so he was resisting all this time.
I think...

2031
01:09:25,760 --> 01:09:27,240
this was your timing.

2032
01:09:27,240 --> 01:09:30,140
Last time, Jong Kook's guess
was wrong.

2033
01:09:30,140 --> 01:09:31,540
Let's see the end of this.

2034
01:09:31,540 --> 01:09:34,510
Right? But when Jong Kook doubts
somebody, I get confused.

2035
01:09:34,510 --> 01:09:36,710
- I think this is...
- It's not me when I say so.

2036
01:09:37,090 --> 01:09:41,750
- But at this point...
- Be quiet.

2037
01:09:41,750 --> 01:09:43,880
- Let's be quiet and play the game.
- Fine. Keep doubting me.

2038
01:09:44,490 --> 01:09:46,500
Country names this time.
Start with Haha.

2039
01:09:46,500 --> 01:09:48,160
- Countries.
- There are so many countries.

2040
01:09:48,160 --> 01:09:49,500
- There are so many countries.
- There are so many.

2041
01:09:49,500 --> 01:09:50,590
Start.

2042
01:09:50,590 --> 01:09:52,870
<i>- 3, 6, 9
- 3, 6, 9</i>

2043
01:09:52,870 --> 01:09:53,870
- One.
- Republic of Korea.

2044
01:09:54,540 --> 01:09:56,130
(1, Republic of Korea)

2045
01:09:56,130 --> 01:09:57,410
(He randomly shows his love
for the country.)

2046
01:09:57,410 --> 01:09:58,670
(He's agitated.)

2047
01:09:58,670 --> 01:10:00,210
- And you think it's me!
- That's my part!

2048
01:10:00,880 --> 01:10:02,130
This isn't strange to you?

2049
01:10:02,130 --> 01:10:04,710
- Sorry... I got nervous.
- I wanted the camera on me.

2050
01:10:04,880 --> 01:10:06,750
- I got really nervous.
- Thailand.

2051
01:10:06,920 --> 01:10:08,080
Kyung-hwan's face.

2052
01:10:08,080 --> 01:10:09,990
Give Kyung-hwan a chance.
He didn't say a word.

2053
01:10:09,990 --> 01:10:12,290
Kyung-hwan's trying so hard
to be funny.

2054
01:10:12,290 --> 01:10:15,160
You were number two,
but you got it wrong. It's you.

2055
01:10:15,160 --> 01:10:16,790
I was thinking of the categories,

2056
01:10:16,790 --> 01:10:19,420
so I thought I had to say it.
My bad.

2057
01:10:19,700 --> 01:10:21,590
I'm sure it's him.

2058
01:10:21,590 --> 01:10:23,760
- This doesn't make sense.
- It has to be him.

2059
01:10:23,760 --> 01:10:25,570
Director Kang and Ha.

2060
01:10:25,570 --> 01:10:27,670
You must be so grateful.

2061
01:10:27,670 --> 01:10:29,800
(Haha must be grateful to Tae Oh.)

2062
01:10:29,800 --> 01:10:31,710
(Me again?)

2063
01:10:31,710 --> 01:10:32,840
Haha must be.

2064
01:10:33,430 --> 01:10:34,970
Jong Kook. Is it Haha today?

2065
01:10:34,970 --> 01:10:36,380
- It's Haha today.
- Is it him?

2066
01:10:36,380 --> 01:10:38,040
Gosh, I knew it.

2067
01:10:38,040 --> 01:10:40,450
He doesn't know what to do
with his hands. He's doing this.

2068
01:10:40,710 --> 01:10:42,170
(His hands are placed politely.)

2069
01:10:42,170 --> 01:10:43,450
Should I do this?

2070
01:10:43,450 --> 01:10:45,290
(Do I have to do this
for you to not doubt me?)

2071
01:10:47,350 --> 01:10:49,010
- Let's start with Suk Jin.
- All right.

2072
01:10:49,010 --> 01:10:52,050
- Let's try country names again.
- Slowly. There's no rush.

2073
01:10:52,050 --> 01:10:54,160
- Let's go.
- There's no rush.

2074
01:10:54,160 --> 01:10:55,330
Start.

2075
01:10:55,330 --> 01:10:58,500
<i>- 3, 6, 9
- 3, 6, 9</i>

2076
01:10:58,500 --> 01:10:59,590
- 1.
- 2.

2077
01:10:59,740 --> 01:11:01,000
- Republic of Korea.
- Four.

2078
01:11:01,000 --> 01:11:02,290
- Five.
- China.

2079
01:11:02,290 --> 01:11:03,300
- 7.
- 8.

2080
01:11:03,300 --> 01:11:04,570
- India.
- 10.

2081
01:11:04,570 --> 01:11:05,670
- 11.
- 12.

2082
01:11:05,670 --> 01:11:06,930
Azerbaijan.

2083
01:11:06,930 --> 01:11:08,580
- 14.
- 15.

2084
01:11:09,750 --> 01:11:10,780
Chile.

2085
01:11:10,780 --> 01:11:12,250
- 17.
- 18.

2086
01:11:12,920 --> 01:11:14,280
Korea.

2087
01:11:14,970 --> 01:11:16,620
- Hey!
- Yoyomi.

2088
01:11:16,710 --> 01:11:18,540
We did Republic of Korea.

2089
01:11:18,540 --> 01:11:19,750
- Director Yo.
- I...

2090
01:11:19,750 --> 01:11:20,790
Director Yo.

2091
01:11:20,790 --> 01:11:21,880
- Director Yo.
- Did we do it?

2092
01:11:21,880 --> 01:11:23,990
My gosh.

2093
01:11:23,990 --> 01:11:25,290
She's just bad.

2094
01:11:25,290 --> 01:11:27,500
If Yoyomi is not the director,

2095
01:11:27,500 --> 01:11:29,590
I want her to have a quiz battle
with Ji Hyo.

2096
01:11:29,760 --> 01:11:31,420
If she's not.

2097
01:11:31,570 --> 01:11:33,430
Kyung-hwan,
have you played this game yet?

2098
01:11:33,430 --> 01:11:34,540
He hasn't.

2099
01:11:34,540 --> 01:11:35,930
I didn't hear your voice.

2100
01:11:35,930 --> 01:11:37,460
Let me talk on the phone first.
Hello?

2101
01:11:37,760 --> 01:11:39,070
Hang up.

2102
01:11:39,070 --> 01:11:41,710
Just say country names and fruits
you know right now.

2103
01:11:42,240 --> 01:11:44,840
I want to eat mangoes in Dubai.

2104
01:11:44,840 --> 01:11:46,820
- He wants to eat mangoes in Dubai.
- In Dubai.

2105
01:11:46,820 --> 01:11:49,680
- His seat is in the shade too.
- Come down here.

2106
01:11:49,680 --> 01:11:51,450
- Come down.
- You're under shade.

2107
01:11:51,450 --> 01:11:52,540
That's the only area with shade.

2108
01:11:52,540 --> 01:11:54,010
I got pushed away.

2109
01:11:54,010 --> 01:11:57,160
- I thought you were a ghost.
- Why is your face so dark?

2110
01:11:57,160 --> 01:11:58,790
I want Se Chan's seat.

2111
01:11:58,790 --> 01:11:59,850
Let's switch.

2112
01:12:00,420 --> 01:12:01,720
This is your last chance.

2113
01:12:01,720 --> 01:12:04,870
Let's start with Haha.

2114
01:12:05,000 --> 01:12:06,670
- Animals this time.
- That's easy.

2115
01:12:06,670 --> 01:12:07,740
That's easy.

2116
01:12:07,740 --> 01:12:09,070
Let's go. Start.

2117
01:12:09,070 --> 01:12:11,100
<i>- 3, 6, 9
- 3, 6, 9</i>

2118
01:12:11,100 --> 01:12:12,100
- 1.
- 2.

2119
01:12:12,100 --> 01:12:13,280
- Monkey.
- Four.

2120
01:12:13,470 --> 01:12:14,470
Five.

2121
01:12:15,470 --> 01:12:16,970
- Elephant?
- So Min.

2122
01:12:16,970 --> 01:12:18,800
(Time over)

2123
01:12:18,800 --> 01:12:20,010
- Elephant?
- So Min.

2124
01:12:20,010 --> 01:12:21,140
- You.
- No, no.

2125
01:12:21,140 --> 01:12:22,780
- I was thinking of something else.
- Why?

2126
01:12:22,780 --> 01:12:24,010
- I'm sleepy.
- Why are you sleepy?

2127
01:12:24,010 --> 01:12:25,010
What were you thinking about?

2128
01:12:25,010 --> 01:12:26,210
Se Chan?
Were you thinking about him?

2129
01:12:26,210 --> 01:12:27,380
- Tae Oh?
- That was odd.

2130
01:12:27,380 --> 01:12:28,460
(Were you thinking about him?)

2131
01:12:28,460 --> 01:12:29,490
Why is she smiling?

2132
01:12:29,490 --> 01:12:31,380
Why are you just smiling?
Say something.

2133
01:12:31,380 --> 01:12:32,960
You want his attention.

2134
01:12:32,960 --> 01:12:34,750
No, Se Chan...

2135
01:12:34,750 --> 01:12:36,260
- So Min and Se Chan.
- What about me?

2136
01:12:36,420 --> 01:12:37,700
No, that's not why.

2137
01:12:37,700 --> 01:12:40,340
Why did you touch
my fingers earlier?

2138
01:12:40,340 --> 01:12:42,840
(Why did you touch
my fingers earlier?)

2139
01:12:42,840 --> 01:12:44,300
- What?
- My gosh.

2140
01:12:44,300 --> 01:12:46,710
(Why did you touch
my fingers earlier?)

2141
01:12:46,710 --> 01:12:47,710
(What's going on?)

2142
01:12:47,710 --> 01:12:49,130
Gosh.

2143
01:12:49,210 --> 01:12:50,950
What did you just say?

2144
01:12:50,950 --> 01:12:52,470
Why would I touch your fingers?
That's nonsense.

2145
01:12:52,470 --> 01:12:53,780
How unpleasant.

2146
01:12:54,080 --> 01:12:55,950
Hey, rewind the camera.

2147
01:12:55,950 --> 01:12:58,140
- Why would I touch her fingers?
- So...

2148
01:12:58,140 --> 01:12:59,420
Are you out of your mind?

2149
01:12:59,420 --> 01:13:00,880
Hey, how could you?

2150
01:13:00,880 --> 01:13:02,460
Jong Kook, she's completely wrong.

2151
01:13:02,460 --> 01:13:04,590
- He's a bad guy.
- It wasn't me.

2152
01:13:04,590 --> 01:13:06,090
- Stop fooling around.
- Somebody...

2153
01:13:06,090 --> 01:13:07,790
Somebody tapped my fingers,
and I looked.

2154
01:13:07,790 --> 01:13:09,890
I was wondering what it was,
and it was his fingers.

2155
01:13:10,090 --> 01:13:11,960
This is driving me nuts.

2156
01:13:12,290 --> 01:13:13,500
- It wasn't me.
- Look.

2157
01:13:13,500 --> 01:13:16,070
It was like this,
and you kept on doing this.

2158
01:13:16,070 --> 01:13:17,430
You rascal.

2159
01:13:17,430 --> 01:13:18,760
You finger killer.

2160
01:13:18,870 --> 01:13:20,170
- I didn't touch your hand.
- Was that a signal?

2161
01:13:20,170 --> 01:13:22,130
How bold.

2162
01:13:22,130 --> 01:13:24,500
(How bold.)

2163
01:13:24,500 --> 01:13:27,120
(Is Se Chan bold
when it comes to love?)

2164
01:13:27,120 --> 01:13:28,880
Kyung-hwan, can we switch seats?

2165
01:13:28,880 --> 01:13:31,010
Hey, it's too late to switch.

2166
01:13:31,950 --> 01:13:33,290
You used your fingers?

2167
01:13:33,290 --> 01:13:34,460
(That's unbelievable.)

2168
01:13:34,460 --> 01:13:36,720
Goodness.
Are you learning the Morse code?

2169
01:13:36,720 --> 01:13:37,850
Morse code?

2170
01:13:37,850 --> 01:13:40,000
This is exactly what he did.
Tap, tap, tap.

2171
01:13:40,220 --> 01:13:42,390
This is Morse code.

2172
01:13:42,390 --> 01:13:43,500
- Let's look it up.
- Is this it?

2173
01:13:43,500 --> 01:13:44,790
"I love you."

2174
01:13:44,790 --> 01:13:46,590
(That's the Morse code.)

2175
01:13:46,590 --> 01:13:47,760
(These two old fossils are
happy for them.)

2176
01:13:47,760 --> 01:13:48,760
"What do you think?"

2177
01:13:48,890 --> 01:13:51,240
So there'll be no hints
regarding the directors.

2178
01:13:51,240 --> 01:13:52,840
(They fail to obtain a hint.)

2179
01:13:52,840 --> 01:13:54,800
We never won this game
on Running Man.

2180
01:13:54,800 --> 01:13:57,170
We have to know who it is.

2181
01:13:57,170 --> 01:13:58,950
Everybody was wrong.

2182
01:13:58,950 --> 01:14:00,450
Didn't we get many hints though?

2183
01:14:00,450 --> 01:14:01,750
I'm suspicious of a few.

2184
01:14:01,750 --> 01:14:03,120
Are there two directors?

2185
01:14:03,250 --> 01:14:05,750
Yoyomi made three mistakes
in the same situation.

2186
01:14:05,990 --> 01:14:07,050
He practically gave it to you.

2187
01:14:07,050 --> 01:14:08,920
Tae Oh, what was "Pokemon"?

2188
01:14:08,920 --> 01:14:10,920
Directors Kang and Ha.

2189
01:14:11,530 --> 01:14:13,750
If it's those two, this is over.

2190
01:14:15,160 --> 01:14:16,920
I think there are water balloons.

2191
01:14:16,920 --> 01:14:18,200
What's this?

2192
01:14:18,200 --> 01:14:19,890
- What's this?
- What's this?

2193
01:14:19,890 --> 01:14:21,870
It's a trophy.

2194
01:14:22,170 --> 01:14:23,600
I watched you on the bus.

2195
01:14:23,600 --> 01:14:25,300
I'm going to give Kyung-hwan
a warning.

2196
01:14:25,300 --> 01:14:27,430
- Why?
- You did nothing today.

2197
01:14:27,430 --> 01:14:29,640
(You did nothing today.)

2198
01:14:30,170 --> 01:14:31,600
(Jae Suk is upset
he's barely there.)

2199
01:14:31,600 --> 01:14:32,840
It's not his fault.

2200
01:14:32,840 --> 01:14:33,970
- I...
- You're making it worse.

2201
01:14:33,970 --> 01:14:35,250
took my back off the seat
multiple times,

2202
01:14:35,250 --> 01:14:37,010
but everybody cut it short.

2203
01:14:37,290 --> 01:14:38,620
- It's a warning, Kyung-hwan.
- Gosh, today.

2204
01:14:38,620 --> 01:14:39,710
He got a warning.

2205
01:14:39,710 --> 01:14:41,880
If you get three warnings,
you have to go home.

2206
01:14:41,880 --> 01:14:43,420
- Sent off.
- It's important.

2207
01:14:43,420 --> 01:14:45,130
- I'll try my best.
- That's our system.

2208
01:14:45,130 --> 01:14:47,630
I'll just say I just joined.

2209
01:14:47,630 --> 01:14:49,160
- He just joined.
- Okay.

2210
01:14:49,390 --> 01:14:50,530
Hold on.

2211
01:14:50,890 --> 01:14:52,570
- All right.
- Okay.

2212
01:14:52,760 --> 01:14:54,460
(My part starts from now.)

2213
01:14:54,460 --> 01:14:56,570
This is a group mission.

2214
01:14:56,570 --> 01:14:58,710
This is the second mission
to earn hints about the directors.

2215
01:14:58,710 --> 01:15:00,540
It's called Speed Movie Review King.

2216
01:15:00,540 --> 01:15:01,910
What's this?

2217
01:15:02,170 --> 01:15:03,840
- Movie Review King?
- Movies again?

2218
01:15:04,140 --> 01:15:06,420
There are three rounds in total.

2219
01:15:06,420 --> 01:15:09,120
Each round has six people...

2220
01:15:09,120 --> 01:15:10,990
- completing the mission.
- Okay.

2221
01:15:10,990 --> 01:15:13,510
There are 10 questions each round,
and if you get 7 questions or more,

2222
01:15:13,510 --> 01:15:14,820
you win.

2223
01:15:15,750 --> 01:15:18,460
One person comes forward
and looks at the given movie title.

2224
01:15:18,460 --> 01:15:20,850
You must stick your face out and
describe in 1 sentence in 3 seconds.

2225
01:15:20,850 --> 01:15:22,460
You win a point
if you get the answer right.

2226
01:15:22,460 --> 01:15:25,220
However, you cannot directly mention
the movie title,

2227
01:15:25,290 --> 01:15:27,590
the cast or quotes from the movie.

2228
01:15:27,590 --> 01:15:30,170
For example,
if the movie is "Harry Potter,"

2229
01:15:30,170 --> 01:15:32,540
"A movie where the man without
a nose is obsessed with a boy."

2230
01:15:32,540 --> 01:15:33,840
You can say that.

2231
01:15:34,500 --> 01:15:36,040
You have to know many movies.

2232
01:15:36,040 --> 01:15:37,840
The remaining five players
have to guess the movie title.

2233
01:15:37,840 --> 01:15:39,880
If the answer is incorrect,
then the people sitting here can...

2234
01:15:39,880 --> 01:15:41,780
throw water balloons at the person
explaining the question.

2235
01:15:41,780 --> 01:15:42,840
That's when the answer is incorrect.

2236
01:15:43,140 --> 01:15:44,820
It's not easy to explain these.

2237
01:15:44,820 --> 01:15:46,820
- Wait. I just got really scared.
- Why?

2238
01:15:46,820 --> 01:15:48,660
Tae Oh just smiled like this.

2239
01:15:48,660 --> 01:15:50,050
Why are you smiling?

2240
01:15:50,050 --> 01:15:51,530
I got really scared.

2241
01:15:51,530 --> 01:15:53,390
- Why?
- We were listening and he's like...

2242
01:15:54,050 --> 01:15:55,160
Why did you laugh?

2243
01:15:57,330 --> 01:16:00,130
(He was explaining the rules.)

2244
01:16:00,130 --> 01:16:01,930
(Chuckling)

2245
01:16:03,000 --> 01:16:05,260
(Chuckling)

2246
01:16:05,910 --> 01:16:07,410
- Look.
- What's wrong?

2247
01:16:07,410 --> 01:16:08,800
- What was that?
- Director Kang.

2248
01:16:08,800 --> 01:16:10,410
- What was that, Tae Oh?
- Director Kang.

2249
01:16:10,410 --> 01:16:12,640
- I...
- What was that? Is there a mission?

2250
01:16:12,950 --> 01:16:14,670
- Tae Oh.
- Why did you laugh?

2251
01:16:14,780 --> 01:16:16,620
- He thinks he was funny.
- What was that?

2252
01:16:16,620 --> 01:16:18,510
You're supposed to guess
the movie title.

2253
01:16:18,640 --> 01:16:20,590
How's that funny?

2254
01:16:20,880 --> 01:16:22,120
- Are we playing this one more time?
- What?

2255
01:16:22,510 --> 01:16:24,290
- Are we playing this one more time?
- This is a different game.

2256
01:16:24,590 --> 01:16:26,030
Is he crazy?

2257
01:16:26,030 --> 01:16:28,160
(Is he crazy?)

2258
01:16:28,500 --> 01:16:30,590
- What's wrong with him?
- I got goosebumps.

2259
01:16:31,070 --> 01:16:34,430
You can't mention the movie title,
cast, character names or lines.

2260
01:16:34,430 --> 01:16:35,570
This is doable.

2261
01:16:35,570 --> 01:16:37,630
It can't be unreasonable, right?

2262
01:16:37,760 --> 01:16:39,300
- For example?
- The description.

2263
01:16:39,740 --> 01:16:40,910
It can't be unreasonable, right?

2264
01:16:40,910 --> 01:16:42,910
(As soon as
Kyung-hwan opens this mouth,)

2265
01:16:42,910 --> 01:16:45,140
(everybody grows quiet.)

2266
01:16:45,140 --> 01:16:46,540
For example?

2267
01:16:47,040 --> 01:16:49,880
- Kyung-hwan, you ruined the mood.
- Hey.

2268
01:16:49,880 --> 01:16:50,990
Hey.

2269
01:16:50,990 --> 01:16:52,880
This is his chance.

2270
01:16:52,880 --> 01:16:55,160
Chul Min treats Kyung-hwan...

2271
01:16:55,160 --> 01:16:57,030
like Seon Jin now.

2272
01:16:57,350 --> 01:16:58,790
He just made a straight face.

2273
01:16:58,790 --> 01:17:00,130
- What did you mean?
- Well...

2274
01:17:00,330 --> 01:17:02,050
If the description is unreasonable,
people won't guess it right.

2275
01:17:02,050 --> 01:17:03,500
- People won't get it right.
- Okay.

2276
01:17:03,500 --> 01:17:05,720
He doesn't usually get mad
at guests.

2277
01:17:05,720 --> 01:17:07,890
Why are you jumping in?

2278
01:17:07,890 --> 01:17:10,570
(He's agitated.)

2279
01:17:10,670 --> 01:17:12,130
Just move on.

2280
01:17:12,130 --> 01:17:14,540
- He made a straight face.
- Why are you blaming me?

2281
01:17:14,710 --> 01:17:17,080
- I got scared again.
- Why?

2282
01:17:17,080 --> 01:17:19,100
When we were all laughing,
Tae Oh didn't.

2283
01:17:19,300 --> 01:17:21,170
- What's wrong with him?
- What's with this guy?

2284
01:17:21,170 --> 01:17:22,380
Director.

2285
01:17:22,380 --> 01:17:23,920
("Unanswered Questions",
Two Faces of Tae Oh)

2286
01:17:24,790 --> 01:17:27,820
(Everybody was laughing,)

2287
01:17:27,820 --> 01:17:31,130
(but he had a straight face.)

2288
01:17:31,830 --> 01:17:34,960
("Unanswered Questions",
Two Faces of Tae Oh)

2289
01:17:34,960 --> 01:17:36,220
Why didn't you laugh?

2290
01:17:36,220 --> 01:17:37,390
Is it a mission?

2291
01:17:37,390 --> 01:17:38,500
(Laughing)

2292
01:17:38,500 --> 01:17:39,790
What's with you?

2293
01:17:39,790 --> 01:17:41,740
(What's with this guy? He's scary.)

2294
01:17:41,740 --> 01:17:42,890
What's wrong?

2295
01:17:42,890 --> 01:17:44,340
- What's wrong?
- He's scary.

2296
01:17:44,340 --> 01:17:46,100
- What's with him?
- What's with him?

2297
01:17:46,100 --> 01:17:48,040
This is in "Joker."

2298
01:17:48,670 --> 01:17:50,450
- That's it.
- It's him.

2299
01:17:50,540 --> 01:17:53,340
- Director.
- His neck is red.

2300
01:17:53,380 --> 01:17:56,210
I'm really upset.
I wasn't saying anything funny.

2301
01:17:56,210 --> 01:17:58,840
- Is that a mission?
- Please be the director.

2302
01:17:58,920 --> 01:18:00,960
Tae Oh.

2303
01:18:00,960 --> 01:18:02,790
He's supposed to laugh
when other people aren't.

2304
01:18:03,010 --> 01:18:06,050
Please pick six people
to play this round.

2305
01:18:06,050 --> 01:18:09,870
Six people. Hold on.
Yoyomi, Hyosung,

2306
01:18:09,870 --> 01:18:11,500
and Tae Oh.

2307
01:18:11,500 --> 01:18:13,570
- Because we're suspicious of them.
- That's right.

2308
01:18:13,570 --> 01:18:15,760
- Should we try Haha too?
- He should play.

2309
01:18:15,760 --> 01:18:17,210
- Haha should play.
- I'll try my best.

2310
01:18:17,210 --> 01:18:18,930
- Kyung-hwan too.
- Okay, good.

2311
01:18:18,930 --> 01:18:19,970
Me?

2312
01:18:20,100 --> 01:18:22,340
- Just do it.
- You just came. You have to play.

2313
01:18:22,340 --> 01:18:23,910
(You just came. You have to play.)

2314
01:18:23,910 --> 01:18:25,170
- Of course.
- You just came.

2315
01:18:25,170 --> 01:18:26,250
I got the water balloons.

2316
01:18:26,250 --> 01:18:27,750
(I'm looking forward to it,
Kyung-hwan)

2317
01:18:27,750 --> 01:18:28,920
- Suk Jin too.
- I like it.

2318
01:18:28,920 --> 01:18:30,680
Let's start with these six.

2319
01:18:30,680 --> 01:18:32,490
(Suk Jin, Haha, Kyung-hwan,
Hyosung, Tae Oh, Yoyomi)

2320
01:18:32,490 --> 01:18:33,850
Let's go. Ready...

2321
01:18:33,850 --> 01:18:35,790
You have to describe the movie
you see.

2322
01:18:35,790 --> 01:18:37,590
- Right.
- We have to guess the answer.

2323
01:18:37,590 --> 01:18:39,350
This is easy.

2324
01:18:39,530 --> 01:18:40,720
You have three seconds.

2325
01:18:40,720 --> 01:18:42,000
Set, go.

2326
01:18:42,000 --> 01:18:43,050
(What's the first movie
he has to describe?)

2327
01:18:43,050 --> 01:18:47,240
This is a very difficult class
in college.

2328
01:18:47,290 --> 01:18:48,500
What?

2329
01:18:49,570 --> 01:18:52,740
(This is a difficult class
in college?)

2330
01:18:54,000 --> 01:18:56,240
(A difficult class?)

2331
01:18:56,240 --> 01:18:57,780
- "Architecture 101".
- "Architecture 101".

2332
01:18:58,410 --> 01:18:59,470
"Architecture 101".

2333
01:19:00,040 --> 01:19:01,950
(Correct)

2334
01:19:02,280 --> 01:19:03,680
- Unbelievable.
- Incredible.

2335
01:19:04,340 --> 01:19:07,210
- Good job.
- He is a college graduate.

2336
01:19:08,210 --> 01:19:10,680
- Haha!
- That was clever.

2337
01:19:10,680 --> 01:19:11,850
(Proud)

2338
01:19:12,790 --> 01:19:14,220
Nice.

2339
01:19:14,550 --> 01:19:16,220
- Unbelievable.
- Good job.

2340
01:19:16,220 --> 01:19:18,830
Tae Oh did a good job.

2341
01:19:19,200 --> 01:19:21,960
Here he comes, Heo Kyung-hwan!

2342
01:19:21,960 --> 01:19:23,340
(The second player is
Heo Kyung-hwan.)

2343
01:19:23,340 --> 01:19:25,840
Here he comes,
the incarnation of humor.

2344
01:19:25,840 --> 01:19:26,840
The feast of humor.

2345
01:19:26,840 --> 01:19:30,250
I'll show you. I'll be funny
and get the question right too.

2346
01:19:30,250 --> 01:19:33,100
(I'll make sure this part airs.)

2347
01:19:33,470 --> 01:19:34,750
(Kyung-hwan has to describe...)

2348
01:19:34,750 --> 01:19:36,250
("The Truman Show.")

2349
01:19:36,640 --> 01:19:38,590
("The Truman Show")

2350
01:19:38,590 --> 01:19:39,750
He lies.

2351
01:19:39,750 --> 01:19:41,160
"Liar".

2352
01:19:41,160 --> 01:19:43,120
(He lies? That's it?)

2353
01:19:43,630 --> 01:19:45,460
(It's like a lie.)

2354
01:19:46,090 --> 01:19:47,660
- What?
- What?

2355
01:19:47,660 --> 01:19:49,160
(I lied when I said I'd be funny.)

2356
01:19:49,660 --> 01:19:51,420
- Kyung-hwan failed.
- What is this?

2357
01:19:51,420 --> 01:19:52,590
(The second question fails.)

2358
01:19:52,870 --> 01:19:53,870
Fail!

2359
01:19:53,870 --> 01:19:55,370
(Even the balloon misses him.)

2360
01:19:55,540 --> 01:19:56,540
Fail!

2361
01:19:57,260 --> 01:20:00,130
(Even the balloon ignores him.)

2362
01:20:00,130 --> 01:20:01,670
It missed him.

2363
01:20:01,710 --> 01:20:02,930
Even the balloon missed him.

2364
01:20:02,930 --> 01:20:04,950
- He wasn't hit.
- Even this fails.

2365
01:20:04,950 --> 01:20:06,640
- This will be edited out.
- What is this?

2366
01:20:06,640 --> 01:20:08,880
It's hard not to be funny
with water balloons.

2367
01:20:08,950 --> 01:20:10,750
Why did you aim at my armpit?

2368
01:20:10,840 --> 01:20:12,040
It hit my armpit.

2369
01:20:12,040 --> 01:20:13,710
It bounced off his face.

2370
01:20:13,710 --> 01:20:16,050
- It just burst.
- It should have burst on his face.

2371
01:20:16,160 --> 01:20:17,350
- Watch the comedian.
- Be serious.

2372
01:20:17,350 --> 01:20:20,250
- Show us.
- Okay. We'll get it right.

2373
01:20:20,500 --> 01:20:22,220
Ready, start.

2374
01:20:22,890 --> 01:20:24,260
(Suk Jin has to describe
"New World.")

2375
01:20:24,670 --> 01:20:25,870
(Well...)

2376
01:20:26,220 --> 01:20:28,170
(What is with him?)

2377
01:20:28,170 --> 01:20:29,890
- What?
- What?

2378
01:20:29,890 --> 01:20:31,740
(All he said is an interjection.)

2379
01:20:31,740 --> 01:20:33,710
Gosh, what was that?

2380
01:20:33,710 --> 01:20:38,040
(They celebrate the comedian's
precious lesson.)

2381
01:20:39,750 --> 01:20:42,320
(So this is what
variety shows are about.)

2382
01:20:42,670 --> 01:20:44,680
I thought only one of you
was supposed to throw the ballon.

2383
01:20:44,710 --> 01:20:45,840
It just slipped my hand.

2384
01:20:45,840 --> 01:20:47,050
We didn't decide whose turn it was.

2385
01:20:47,050 --> 01:20:48,420
- It slipped my hand.
- We didn't decide.

2386
01:20:48,420 --> 01:20:49,960
- Hey, I said I would do it.
- I said I would do it.

2387
01:20:49,960 --> 01:20:51,720
I thought it was my turn.

2388
01:20:51,720 --> 01:20:52,990
I thought it was my turn too.

2389
01:20:52,990 --> 01:20:54,720
I wasn't doing anything.

2390
01:20:54,720 --> 01:20:55,830
A candy...

2391
01:20:56,220 --> 01:20:58,330
- "Peppermint Candy."
- Well...

2392
01:20:58,960 --> 01:21:00,430
(The most suspicious one,
Tae Oh, fails.)

2393
01:21:00,430 --> 01:21:01,960
- What is it?
- You don't know this movie?

2394
01:21:01,960 --> 01:21:03,740
- Oh, my.
- What is it?

2395
01:21:04,500 --> 01:21:05,800
- Nice.
- It's over.

2396
01:21:05,800 --> 01:21:07,210
- It's over.
- It's over.

2397
01:21:07,210 --> 01:21:10,100
You failed in the 1st round.
Let's move on to the 2nd round.

2398
01:21:10,640 --> 01:21:11,840
(Will they be able to
find the directors?)

2399
01:21:11,840 --> 01:21:13,300
There are two directors, right?

2400
01:21:13,300 --> 01:21:14,320
(Will they be able to
find the directors?)

2401
01:21:15,510 --> 01:21:17,680
(A suspicious movement is captured.)

2402
01:21:18,380 --> 01:21:19,710
(Using the few hints,)

2403
01:21:19,710 --> 01:21:21,320
(they have to find the directors.)

2404
01:21:21,820 --> 01:21:23,120
(There is...)

2405
01:21:23,120 --> 01:21:24,660
(no easy opponent.)

2406
01:21:25,130 --> 01:21:27,530
(The great actors begin
a mind game.)

2407
01:21:28,390 --> 01:21:31,000
(They hear something
that shocks everyone.)

2408
01:21:31,760 --> 01:21:34,170
(Someone is acting.)

2409
01:21:35,040 --> 01:21:37,370
(The situation becomes explosive.)

2410
01:21:38,600 --> 01:21:40,930
(No one can be trusted too much.)

2411
01:21:40,930 --> 01:21:43,240
(A fierce battle
behind the film festival)

2412
01:21:43,240 --> 01:21:45,100
(Will the national actor be safe
from the uninvited ones?)

2413
01:21:45,100 --> 01:21:46,670
(Someone is putting on a show.)

2414
01:21:46,670 --> 01:21:48,420
(What are the clever tricks
and what is the truth?)

2415
01:21:49,420 --> 01:21:51,590
(The Uninvited One)
