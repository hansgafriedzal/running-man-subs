1
00:00:04,850 --> 00:00:06,450
(Last week)

2
00:00:07,110 --> 00:00:09,880
(Hyosung, Yoyomi, Kyung-hwan,
and Tae Oh joined last week.)

3
00:00:11,090 --> 00:00:13,660
(Ggannes Film Festival:
The Uninvited One)

4
00:00:14,260 --> 00:00:17,180
(2 directors and 1 national actor
are among them.)

5
00:00:17,730 --> 00:00:19,920
(Team Actors will win
if they identify 2 directors...)

6
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:22,200
(with the national actor
and eliminate them.)

7
00:00:22,200 --> 00:00:24,400
(If the directors find out
who the national actor is...)

8
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:26,430
(and eliminate the national actor,
Team Directors win.)

9
00:00:26,430 --> 00:00:29,330
(They checked their identities
on their mini name tags.)

10
00:00:29,830 --> 00:00:32,470
(Who are the 2 directors
among the group?)

11
00:00:33,110 --> 00:00:36,610
(Team Jong Kook obtained
a hint about the director.)

12
00:00:36,610 --> 00:00:37,910
(1 director is a man
and 1 director is a woman.)

13
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:40,970
(1 of the directors is a man,
and the other, a woman.)

14
00:00:40,970 --> 00:00:43,220
This is the second mission
to earn hints about the directors.

15
00:00:43,220 --> 00:00:44,960
It's called Speed Movie Review King.

16
00:00:45,150 --> 00:00:47,930
One person comes forward
and looks at the given movie title.

17
00:00:47,930 --> 00:00:50,430
You must stick your face out and
describe in 1 sentence in 3 seconds.

18
00:00:50,430 --> 00:00:51,900
You win a point
if you get the answer right.

19
00:00:51,900 --> 00:00:54,860
However, you cannot directly mention
the movie title,

20
00:00:54,900 --> 00:00:56,830
the cast or quotes from the movie.

21
00:00:58,330 --> 00:01:00,790
(They didn't earn the hint
as they failed the 1st round.)

22
00:01:00,790 --> 00:01:03,400
You failed your 1st round.
Pick someone for your 2nd round.

23
00:01:05,140 --> 00:01:06,280
We should switch.

24
00:01:06,280 --> 00:01:07,780
- Shall we start? Start?
- Let's switch.

25
00:01:07,870 --> 00:01:10,050
I have to show you how it's done.
I have no choice.

26
00:01:10,050 --> 00:01:11,350
(The directors might fail on purpose
to sabotage the game.)

27
00:01:12,050 --> 00:01:13,940
(Jae Suk, Kwang Soo, So Min,
Ji Hyo, Jong Kook, and Se Chan)

28
00:01:13,940 --> 00:01:16,520
You can discuss it before answering.

29
00:01:16,550 --> 00:01:18,520
- Goodness, this one.
- Gosh.

30
00:01:18,790 --> 00:01:21,160
Guys, you guys are so frustrating.

31
00:01:21,460 --> 00:01:23,690
(What was that?)

32
00:01:23,960 --> 00:01:26,900
I bet all of my money
that he won't get it right.

33
00:01:26,900 --> 00:01:28,820
By the way,
he's the king of improvised lines.

34
00:01:28,820 --> 00:01:31,130
- Jong Kook. You know...
- Gosh, Jae Suk.

35
00:01:31,130 --> 00:01:33,070
You should go first.
The king of improvised lines.

36
00:01:33,570 --> 00:01:34,910
(Is it time for me
to take the lead?)

37
00:01:34,910 --> 00:01:35,940
- The king of improvised lines.
- Gosh.

38
00:01:35,940 --> 00:01:38,240
- The king is going to play now.
- I'm already looking forward to it.

39
00:01:38,410 --> 00:01:39,830
I'm really looking forward to that.

40
00:01:40,040 --> 00:01:41,910
Jae Suk, you look
very nervous right now.

41
00:01:41,910 --> 00:01:42,910
Not at all.

42
00:01:42,910 --> 00:01:44,570
- You look very nervous right now.
- Not at all.

43
00:01:44,770 --> 00:01:45,970
- Don't be so nervous.
- Look at me.

44
00:01:45,970 --> 00:01:47,180
Why are your lips so purple?

45
00:01:48,050 --> 00:01:49,440
- Don't be so nervous.
- Hey.

46
00:01:49,820 --> 00:01:51,050
- Just watch me.
- Okay.

47
00:01:51,050 --> 00:01:52,690
Do you know
what I'm doing behind this?

48
00:01:52,690 --> 00:01:53,850
- What?
- What?

49
00:01:54,850 --> 00:01:58,050
I have my hands in my pocket.

50
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:00,050
(He's laid-back as he's the king.)

51
00:02:00,050 --> 00:02:01,770
This shows that I'm totally at ease.

52
00:02:02,070 --> 00:02:03,990
- He's confident.
- You're no joke.

53
00:02:03,990 --> 00:02:06,240
- You're totally relaxed.
- I'm flexing it.

54
00:02:06,300 --> 00:02:07,900
- He's "flexing".
- You're so cool.

55
00:02:07,940 --> 00:02:09,070
Here's your question.

56
00:02:09,100 --> 00:02:11,380
- You have three seconds. Ready,
- Let's go.

57
00:02:11,380 --> 00:02:13,200
set, go.

58
00:02:14,380 --> 00:02:15,570
Hey, it's...

59
00:02:15,570 --> 00:02:16,750
"Hey".

60
00:02:17,310 --> 00:02:19,220
(The explanation of the movie
by the king of improvised lines)

61
00:02:19,220 --> 00:02:21,010
- Hold on. Al...
- Goodness. This is so easy.

62
00:02:22,010 --> 00:02:24,120
(They didn't get it wrong, but why
did he get the water balloon?)

63
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:25,450
(He's punished
for his weak explanation.)

64
00:02:25,450 --> 00:02:26,720
- Not yet. You have to answer first.
- We didn't answer yet.

65
00:02:27,190 --> 00:02:28,590
Hey, throw it at him.

66
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:30,160
- "Al"? Hold on.
- Do it.

67
00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:31,630
"Al"?

68
00:02:31,950 --> 00:02:33,390
Could it be "Jurassic Park"?

69
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:35,420
- "Running Man".
- No, no.

70
00:02:35,530 --> 00:02:37,160
- "Jurassic Park".
- We're talking about movies.

71
00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:38,340
- There's a movie with that name.
- Oh, the movie?

72
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:39,730
There's no way they gave us that.

73
00:02:39,790 --> 00:02:40,890
There's no way.

74
00:02:40,890 --> 00:02:42,230
I doubt that they gave us that
as our question.

75
00:02:42,230 --> 00:02:43,310
- "Jurassic Park" is the only one...
- That's it.

76
00:02:43,310 --> 00:02:44,370
- I can think of.
- Fine.

77
00:02:44,370 --> 00:02:45,510
- In 1, 2, 3.
- What's your answer?

78
00:02:45,510 --> 00:02:46,630
- "Jurassic Park".
- "Jurassic Park".

79
00:02:47,880 --> 00:02:50,140
(The king of improvised lines' hint
was "Al".)

80
00:02:50,140 --> 00:02:51,910
(Will the answer be
"Jurassic Park"?)

81
00:02:51,910 --> 00:02:53,820
- In 1, 2, 3. "Jurassic Park".
- In 2, 3. "Jurassic Park".

82
00:02:54,470 --> 00:02:55,720
- What's the answer?
- What was the hint about?

83
00:02:55,720 --> 00:02:57,620
(Incorrect)

84
00:02:57,620 --> 00:02:58,690
"Aladdin".

85
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:00,380
I see. It was the first syllable
of the title.

86
00:03:00,380 --> 00:03:02,560
- I gave you the first syllable.
- But you cannot do that.

87
00:03:03,160 --> 00:03:04,920
- You can't say the title.
- That's cheating.

88
00:03:05,030 --> 00:03:06,920
- What did you say?
- You can't say part of the title.

89
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:08,220
It's okay for you
to be bad at games,

90
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:10,070
but you cheat and play dirty.

91
00:03:10,290 --> 00:03:12,730
- Why put your hands in your pocket?
- Why isn't that allowed?

92
00:03:12,790 --> 00:03:15,010
- They did that earlier.
- We can't say anything about it?

93
00:03:15,010 --> 00:03:16,100
- Okay, I got it.
- You can't.

94
00:03:16,310 --> 00:03:18,230
- We'll start.
- Watch me. I'll "shaw" you.

95
00:03:18,440 --> 00:03:19,600
- He'll "shaw" us.
- "Shaw"?

96
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:20,670
Watch me. I'll "shaw" you.

97
00:03:20,670 --> 00:03:21,970
(You'll "shaw" us?)

98
00:03:21,970 --> 00:03:23,600
Se Chan sounds really nervous.

99
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:24,780
- He's really nervous now.
- What?

100
00:03:24,910 --> 00:03:27,350
- I'm sorry.
<i>- I'll shaw you</i>

101
00:03:27,750 --> 00:03:28,910
I'll shaw you. Watch.

102
00:03:28,910 --> 00:03:29,980
(He's a fool.)

103
00:03:29,980 --> 00:03:31,410
- I can "dew" a good job.
- That's cute.

104
00:03:31,410 --> 00:03:32,850
The way he said it was cute, right?

105
00:03:32,850 --> 00:03:34,320
- I'll show you.
- Start.

106
00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:37,160
(The second question begins.)

107
00:03:37,160 --> 00:03:41,190
He goes up somewhere
and meets a grandma.

108
00:03:41,260 --> 00:03:42,600
(He goes up somewhere
and meets a grandma.)

109
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:43,820
"The Way Home".

110
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:45,290
- "The Way Home".
- Hold on.

111
00:03:45,290 --> 00:03:46,730
- He goes up and meets a grandma?
- "The Way Home".

112
00:03:46,730 --> 00:03:47,890
Does he go up the mountain?

113
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,760
He goes up and meets a grandma?

114
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:50,940
"The Way Home".

115
00:03:50,940 --> 00:03:52,040
- Wait. Be quiet.
- Does that count as going up?

116
00:03:52,040 --> 00:03:53,100
Be quiet!

117
00:03:53,100 --> 00:03:55,510
(Wait. Be quiet. Be quiet!)

118
00:03:55,510 --> 00:03:57,940
(He gets mad
in the middle of the quiz.)

119
00:03:58,880 --> 00:04:00,250
Don't be so rash!

120
00:04:00,750 --> 00:04:01,910
- Hey.
- Why are you so...

121
00:04:01,980 --> 00:04:03,510
- I was just talking.
- What's wrong with you?

122
00:04:03,510 --> 00:04:04,640
He sounds very mad.

123
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:05,980
Who meets the grandma?

124
00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:08,760
- The grandma?
- It has to be "The Way Home".

125
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:10,320
- "The Way Home".
- That's the only possible answer.

126
00:04:10,320 --> 00:04:11,560
- It's "The Way Home".
- Okay. It's "The Way Home".

127
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:12,950
- What's your answer?
- "The Way Home"!

128
00:04:13,390 --> 00:04:14,530
- That's correct!
- Yes!

129
00:04:14,530 --> 00:04:15,870
("The Way Home"
is the right answer.)

130
00:04:16,970 --> 00:04:18,500
- I did a good job, right?
- "The Way Home".

131
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:19,790
- Did I do a good job?
- Well done.

132
00:04:19,790 --> 00:04:20,960
- I did well, right?
- Well done.

133
00:04:20,960 --> 00:04:22,130
- Well done.
- Well done.

134
00:04:22,130 --> 00:04:24,170
- I did well.
- You did very well.

135
00:04:24,170 --> 00:04:25,510
Hey, it's your girlfriend's turn.

136
00:04:26,030 --> 00:04:27,200
My girlfriend?

137
00:04:27,900 --> 00:04:29,250
(Peekaboo)

138
00:04:30,310 --> 00:04:31,640
My goodness.

139
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:33,050
You're unbelievable.

140
00:04:33,320 --> 00:04:35,010
You're something else.

141
00:04:35,010 --> 00:04:36,550
Here you go. Start.

142
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:38,690
- Gosh.
- That's hard.

143
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:40,820
Gosh, the doll is really scary.

144
00:04:40,820 --> 00:04:43,130
(Gosh, the doll is really scary.)

145
00:04:43,130 --> 00:04:44,490
- Okay.
- "Child's Play".

146
00:04:44,490 --> 00:04:45,820
(Answering right away)

147
00:04:45,820 --> 00:04:47,230
- Wait.
- Hold on.

148
00:04:47,230 --> 00:04:48,690
- It's "Child's Play".
- No, she can't mention that.

149
00:04:48,930 --> 00:04:51,570
- I told you not to be so rash!
- Jong Kook.

150
00:04:52,030 --> 00:04:53,170
Goodness.

151
00:04:53,170 --> 00:04:55,760
- Why are you wasting our chance?
- Jae Suk...

152
00:04:55,870 --> 00:04:57,130
Let's discuss this first.

153
00:04:57,130 --> 00:04:58,270
It's not because he's the director.

154
00:04:58,270 --> 00:05:00,440
- He's just easily distracted.
- Listen.

155
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:02,510
I bet that for 12 years,
in his student record,

156
00:05:02,510 --> 00:05:04,010
- it said he was easily distracted.
- How did you know that?

157
00:05:04,110 --> 00:05:05,250
I'm the same way with you.

158
00:05:05,320 --> 00:05:07,340
We could have discussed it.

159
00:05:07,340 --> 00:05:08,840
She can't probably mention the doll.

160
00:05:09,340 --> 00:05:11,140
- It has to be that. "Annabelle"
- "Annabelle".

161
00:05:11,320 --> 00:05:12,490
What's your answer?

162
00:05:12,490 --> 00:05:13,580
- "Annabelle".
- "Annabelle".

163
00:05:14,650 --> 00:05:17,690
(She mentioned a scary doll.
What's the right answer?)

164
00:05:18,020 --> 00:05:19,230
- Okay.
- Okay.

165
00:05:19,230 --> 00:05:20,360
That was well-played, Jong Kook.

166
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:21,450
(They answered
2 questions out of 3.)

167
00:05:21,450 --> 00:05:23,000
They are good at this.

168
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,070
Jong Kook, you can go next.

169
00:05:24,130 --> 00:05:25,530
- Jong Kook, show us.
- Jong Kook.

170
00:05:25,740 --> 00:05:28,090
- Let's see how good you are.
- "Let's see how good you are."

171
00:05:28,090 --> 00:05:29,830
I'm not saying
that I'm good at this.

172
00:05:29,940 --> 00:05:31,770
I just want you
to answer this carefully.

173
00:05:31,770 --> 00:05:32,830
We'll calm down.

174
00:05:32,830 --> 00:05:34,440
- We'll give it a go.
- Ready, set, go.

175
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:35,980
(Fourth question,
"Bohemian Rhapsody")

176
00:05:36,900 --> 00:05:38,880
He sings songs on stage.

177
00:05:39,210 --> 00:05:40,210
- Hold on.
- He sings songs on stage?

178
00:05:40,210 --> 00:05:41,840
- It could be "Bohemian Rhapsody".
- "Born to Sing"?

179
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:43,420
There's "Highway Star" too.

180
00:05:43,420 --> 00:05:44,640
- No.
- There's "Born to Sing" too.

181
00:05:44,640 --> 00:05:45,710
It's "200 Pounds Beauty".

182
00:05:46,060 --> 00:05:47,820
- There are too many.
- Then, he should've said "she".

183
00:05:47,820 --> 00:05:48,820
Right.

184
00:05:48,820 --> 00:05:50,230
- "Bohemian Rhapsody".
- Gosh, "Bohemian Rhapsody".

185
00:05:50,230 --> 00:05:51,820
- There's one for The Beatles too.
- Wait. You can't...

186
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,390
- You can't make a face for it.
- "Bohemian Rhapsody".

187
00:05:53,390 --> 00:05:54,430
- "Bohemian Rhapsody".
- No?

188
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:58,190
(Making a face
while blinking furiously)

189
00:05:58,830 --> 00:06:00,830
- "Bohemian Rhapsody".
- What? Hold on.

190
00:06:00,830 --> 00:06:02,110
- Wait.
- What's wrong with that?

191
00:06:02,110 --> 00:06:03,260
- I didn't do anything.
- He just blinked.

192
00:06:03,260 --> 00:06:04,510
"200 Pounds Beauty".

193
00:06:04,870 --> 00:06:06,110
Wait. No.

194
00:06:06,110 --> 00:06:07,440
"Bohemian Rhapsody".

195
00:06:08,550 --> 00:06:09,570
Jae Suk.

196
00:06:09,570 --> 00:06:11,310
What? I didn't do anything.

197
00:06:12,010 --> 00:06:13,680
- "Bohemian Rhapsody".
- "Bohemian Rhapsody".

198
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:15,050
"200 Pounds Beauty".

199
00:06:15,990 --> 00:06:17,340
Bo.

200
00:06:17,550 --> 00:06:18,690
200.

201
00:06:18,690 --> 00:06:20,060
- "Born to Sing"?
- That's it.

202
00:06:20,210 --> 00:06:21,280
- Come here.
- All right. Jae Suk.

203
00:06:21,420 --> 00:06:22,630
(He doesn't need to speak.)

204
00:06:22,630 --> 00:06:24,430
- Hey, Jae Suk. In 1, 2, 3.
- In 1, 2, 3.

205
00:06:24,430 --> 00:06:25,590
- "Bohemian Rhapsody".
- "Bohemian Rhapsody".

206
00:06:26,060 --> 00:06:29,230
(Fine, we'll let you take it.
That's correct.)

207
00:06:29,230 --> 00:06:30,390
Okay!

208
00:06:30,460 --> 00:06:32,870
Wait, he opened his eyes wide.

209
00:06:32,940 --> 00:06:35,240
- Okay. Great.
- Okay.

210
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:36,330
(When everyone is having fun now,)

211
00:06:36,330 --> 00:06:38,200
(the Airtime Destroyer
is worried about his airtime.)

212
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:39,880
(Mom)

213
00:06:40,010 --> 00:06:41,030
Ready,

214
00:06:41,480 --> 00:06:43,770
set, go.

215
00:06:44,900 --> 00:06:46,050
- He uses magic.
- Start.

216
00:06:46,980 --> 00:06:49,010
He uses magic. He uses magic.

217
00:06:49,380 --> 00:06:50,990
- What?
- "Harry Potter".

218
00:06:50,990 --> 00:06:52,620
- "Harry Potter".
- He uses magic.

219
00:06:53,320 --> 00:06:54,710
Gosh, this is hard.

220
00:06:54,710 --> 00:06:55,930
- Goodness, this is difficult.
- When it comes to magic,

221
00:06:55,930 --> 00:06:57,230
- I only think of "Harry Potter".
- No.

222
00:06:57,230 --> 00:06:58,500
Don't do anything.

223
00:06:58,760 --> 00:06:59,760
What are you doing?

224
00:06:59,760 --> 00:07:01,060
What else do we have
other than "Harry Potter"?

225
00:07:01,060 --> 00:07:02,520
- No, you can't do that.
- It's not "The Lord of the Rings".

226
00:07:02,520 --> 00:07:03,760
- What other movies are about magic?
- What is it?

227
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:05,760
Jae Suk keeps asking what it is.

228
00:07:06,590 --> 00:07:08,330
What other movies do we have
for magic?

229
00:07:08,870 --> 00:07:11,530
- The one with Gang Dong Won.
- "Haunters".

230
00:07:11,530 --> 00:07:12,900
The one with Gang Dong Won in it.

231
00:07:12,900 --> 00:07:14,270
He wears that costume and flies.

232
00:07:14,900 --> 00:07:16,810
- "Jeon Woo-chi"?
- "Jeon Woo-chi".

233
00:07:17,050 --> 00:07:18,320
- "Jeon Woo-chi"?
- "Jeon Woo-chi"?

234
00:07:18,320 --> 00:07:22,210
(Could that be the answer, Se Chan?)

235
00:07:22,210 --> 00:07:23,880
"Jeon Woo-chi" must be the answer.

236
00:07:23,880 --> 00:07:24,940
(Smiling)

237
00:07:25,510 --> 00:07:28,380
(When he hears "Jeon Woo-chi",
he can't stop smiling.)

238
00:07:30,730 --> 00:07:31,860
(They communicate
with the trophy of the truth.)

239
00:07:31,860 --> 00:07:33,690
- That's not a bad answer.
- "Jeon Woo-chi".

240
00:07:33,690 --> 00:07:35,000
- That's cheating.
- Shall we go with that?

241
00:07:35,070 --> 00:07:37,020
- In 1, 2, 3.
- Jong Kook.

242
00:07:37,130 --> 00:07:39,300
- "Jeon Woo-chi".
- "Jeon Woo-chi".

243
00:07:39,630 --> 00:07:41,440
(That's correct!)

244
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:43,760
- How did they get that right?
- That's amazing.

245
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:45,130
How did you get that right?

246
00:07:45,270 --> 00:07:47,200
- Next.
- Go, Mr. Fish.

247
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:48,240
Okay.

248
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:50,400
- Make sure to fully discuss it.
- Okay.

249
00:07:50,570 --> 00:07:51,710
All right. Here we go.

250
00:07:52,250 --> 00:07:54,380
- Ready,
- Look at his face.

251
00:07:54,380 --> 00:07:55,750
- set,
- You must explain right away.

252
00:07:56,320 --> 00:07:57,380
go!

253
00:07:58,690 --> 00:08:00,920
Why is this day on this day?

254
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:02,380
- Hold on.
- Hold on.

255
00:08:02,380 --> 00:08:04,860
- "Why is this day on this day?"
- "Why is this day on this day?"

256
00:08:04,860 --> 00:08:07,300
- But his explanation was great.
- I'm sure they'll get it right.

257
00:08:07,450 --> 00:08:08,570
I guess it was a good explanation.

258
00:08:08,570 --> 00:08:10,130
- It has to do with a date.
- It wasn't bad.

259
00:08:10,130 --> 00:08:11,260
"Why is this day on this day?"

260
00:08:11,370 --> 00:08:13,130
- It has to be a date.
- "1987".

261
00:08:13,130 --> 00:08:15,200
- "1987"?
- "1987"? Wait. No.

262
00:08:15,330 --> 00:08:16,330
We must say it as a group.

263
00:08:18,610 --> 00:08:21,030
(He tries to cheat.)

264
00:08:21,030 --> 00:08:22,980
What?

265
00:08:22,980 --> 00:08:24,380
You keep moving your fingers.

266
00:08:24,380 --> 00:08:25,510
Not yet.

267
00:08:25,510 --> 00:08:27,320
- Goodness.
- "Why is this day on this day?"

268
00:08:27,320 --> 00:08:28,940
I guess this day
must not make sense for this day.

269
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:31,550
I got it! I figured it out!

270
00:08:31,990 --> 00:08:33,120
It's "Christmas in August".

271
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:34,320
- Yes, that must be it.
- Yes!

272
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:36,080
(It's "Christmas in August".)

273
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:37,260
- That must be it.
- That must be it.

274
00:08:37,260 --> 00:08:39,050
- I got it. "Christmas in August".
- "Christmas in August".

275
00:08:39,420 --> 00:08:42,290
(Is the right answer
"Christmas in August"?)

276
00:08:42,290 --> 00:08:43,830
- "Christmas in August".
- "Christmas in August".

277
00:08:44,420 --> 00:08:47,560
(That's correct!)

278
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:48,800
Yes!

279
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:49,930
- His fingers...
- Why did you throw the balloon?

280
00:08:49,930 --> 00:08:51,840
- Why did you throw it at him?
- We could've done that too.

281
00:08:51,930 --> 00:08:53,270
Wait, this isn't a team match.
It's for everyone.

282
00:08:53,270 --> 00:08:55,140
I thought we were competing
against each other. I got confused.

283
00:08:55,140 --> 00:08:57,350
- He's acting really strange.
- I really got confused.

284
00:08:57,350 --> 00:08:58,910
- My gosh.
- I did give you a hint.

285
00:08:58,980 --> 00:09:00,510
- Why did you do that?
- But he threw the balloon at me.

286
00:09:00,510 --> 00:09:01,620
You gave us a hint?

287
00:09:01,620 --> 00:09:03,410
- I was doing this with my fingers.
- Really?

288
00:09:03,590 --> 00:09:05,490
All of a sudden, Haha threw
the water balloon at me.

289
00:09:05,650 --> 00:09:07,120
- What are you doing?
- We can do that too?

290
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:08,490
I really thought
this was a competition.

291
00:09:08,490 --> 00:09:09,920
It's not a competition.
We must all get the hint.

292
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:11,380
- It's for the whole group.
- What's wrong with him?

293
00:09:11,550 --> 00:09:13,130
- You didn't give us the hint.
- Hey.

294
00:09:13,130 --> 00:09:14,390
Of course,
we're competing against you...

295
00:09:14,390 --> 00:09:15,790
because you're a director.

296
00:09:15,790 --> 00:09:17,000
- What are you talking about?
- And we...

297
00:09:17,290 --> 00:09:20,930
(Jong Kook starts to activate
his radar for spies again.)

298
00:09:20,930 --> 00:09:22,870
The spy instinct hits you
before you know it.

299
00:09:22,930 --> 00:09:25,930
- This is crazy. Okay, fine.
- When you get into it, it happens.

300
00:09:25,930 --> 00:09:27,480
Let us play one more time.

301
00:09:27,770 --> 00:09:29,800
- We should play again.
- Hear us out.

302
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:31,300
- We didn't have time to discuss it.
- I was doing this the whole time.

303
00:09:31,300 --> 00:09:33,120
- So our clip wasn't funny at all.
- We can be funny too.

304
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:34,770
You have one more round.

305
00:09:34,770 --> 00:09:36,220
You must complete the next round
to complete the mission.

306
00:09:36,220 --> 00:09:38,490
Listen. The winning team
doesn't get the hint.

307
00:09:38,490 --> 00:09:40,880
- This isn't a match between us.
- We're on the same team.

308
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:42,180
- I know that.
- Listen.

309
00:09:42,180 --> 00:09:44,680
- Because we have this guy here...
- Excuse me. "This guy"?

310
00:09:44,680 --> 00:09:46,890
(Haha is super sensitive.
Kyung-hwan sounds like a thug.)

311
00:09:46,890 --> 00:09:48,360
(They aren't happy
as there won't be a lot of airtime.)

312
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:50,020
They are not interested in the hint.

313
00:09:50,390 --> 00:09:52,100
- It's because of the airtime.
- We're just worried...

314
00:09:52,260 --> 00:09:53,970
- that our clip won't air on TV.
- Let's do this.

315
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:56,430
We want to be entertaining too.

316
00:09:56,430 --> 00:09:58,370
- You guys were fun in your own way.
- Right.

317
00:09:58,430 --> 00:09:59,900
When were we funny?

318
00:09:59,900 --> 00:10:01,800
(Let's get something straight.)

319
00:10:01,950 --> 00:10:03,270
- There's the third round.
- Let's play again.

320
00:10:03,270 --> 00:10:04,480
- You must pick six people again.
- What?

321
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:05,640
- You should form a team again.
- We'll play again.

322
00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:06,810
- We'll play.
- Okay.

323
00:10:06,850 --> 00:10:08,010
- Listen.
- This is unfair.

324
00:10:08,010 --> 00:10:09,250
We're on the same team.

325
00:10:09,250 --> 00:10:11,780
Ready, set, go.

326
00:10:12,010 --> 00:10:13,090
("Ant-Man")

327
00:10:13,090 --> 00:10:16,460
Gosh, I didn't know a hero
as small as me existed.

328
00:10:16,460 --> 00:10:17,520
- Hero?
- A small hero?

329
00:10:17,520 --> 00:10:18,920
- "Ant-Man".
- He's small.

330
00:10:18,920 --> 00:10:20,150
- "Ant-Man".
- Hold on.

331
00:10:20,150 --> 00:10:22,420
Is that the only small hero?

332
00:10:22,420 --> 00:10:24,790
- It's a small hero.
- I know who it is. It's him.

333
00:10:24,790 --> 00:10:26,760
- Let's see if there are more.
- Right.

334
00:10:26,930 --> 00:10:28,340
- They're making it harder for them.
- Right.

335
00:10:28,340 --> 00:10:31,130
- They are.
- They're making it harder.

336
00:10:31,130 --> 00:10:32,980
What other heroes are small?

337
00:10:32,980 --> 00:10:34,030
Isn't it just him?

338
00:10:34,030 --> 00:10:35,210
(They can't think
of anything funnier.)

339
00:10:35,210 --> 00:10:36,640
- Lego.
- "Stuart Little".

340
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:38,950
You already got the answer.
Why are you hesitating?

341
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:40,220
You already got it.

342
00:10:40,220 --> 00:10:41,620
Come on.

343
00:10:41,620 --> 00:10:43,280
- Come on.
- You're trying so hard.

344
00:10:43,640 --> 00:10:45,260
Aren't you going to say,
"Ant-Man" anyway?

345
00:10:45,260 --> 00:10:47,090
We need to think
of something funnier...

346
00:10:47,090 --> 00:10:48,410
so that we'll get more screen time.

347
00:10:48,630 --> 00:10:49,780
Hold on.

348
00:10:49,780 --> 00:10:50,920
(They're trying to get
more screen time.)

349
00:10:50,920 --> 00:10:51,920
(Smiling)

350
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:54,520
- It's obviously "Ant-Man".
- That's enough.

351
00:10:54,790 --> 00:10:56,420
Be more creative!

352
00:10:56,420 --> 00:10:57,420
(He pressures them
to be more creative.)

353
00:10:57,420 --> 00:10:58,630
"Ant-Man".

354
00:10:58,630 --> 00:11:00,000
- "The Incredible Hulk".
- "Superman".

355
00:11:01,740 --> 00:11:03,660
- It's "Ant-Man" for sure.
- What's your answer?

356
00:11:03,740 --> 00:11:05,630
- "Ant-Man".
- 1, 2, 3.

357
00:11:05,630 --> 00:11:06,800
(They're not in harmony.)

358
00:11:07,270 --> 00:11:08,880
(Nothing is working out for him.)

359
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:10,040
They're not in harmony at all.

360
00:11:10,040 --> 00:11:11,850
- 1, 2, 3. "Ant-Man".
- "Ant-Man".

361
00:11:11,850 --> 00:11:13,250
- My team's so boring.
- Right.

362
00:11:13,250 --> 00:11:14,380
(That is the correct answer.)

363
00:11:14,380 --> 00:11:15,810
(My team's so boring.)

364
00:11:16,010 --> 00:11:18,180
- No, Chul Min edits well.
- You guys are boring.

365
00:11:18,180 --> 00:11:19,760
Don't be ridiculous.

366
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:21,260
They can make it interesting.

367
00:11:21,410 --> 00:11:23,050
It gets boring when Kyung-hwan...

368
00:11:23,050 --> 00:11:24,730
- is in the picture.
- Right.

369
00:11:25,390 --> 00:11:27,200
(He's boring.)

370
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:28,890
- It's so weird.
- What do you mean?

371
00:11:28,890 --> 00:11:30,890
- Why are you like that?
- What are you talking about?

372
00:11:31,230 --> 00:11:33,030
I'm making everyone laugh.

373
00:11:33,030 --> 00:11:34,600
Is this magic?

374
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:36,370
- Kyung-hwan.
- My goodness.

375
00:11:36,370 --> 00:11:38,470
How can I make it funnier
when we already have the answer?

376
00:11:38,470 --> 00:11:39,770
- But...
- I know.

377
00:11:39,770 --> 00:11:42,140
(Take this water balloon
for more screen time.)

378
00:11:43,350 --> 00:11:47,220
(Kwang Soo hits him
with a water balloon.)

379
00:11:48,350 --> 00:11:50,620
It didn't burst.

380
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:52,510
It didn't burst.

381
00:11:52,650 --> 00:11:55,150
- It could've been funny.
- Why didn't it burst?

382
00:11:55,150 --> 00:11:56,360
Please!

383
00:11:56,360 --> 00:11:57,460
(His screen time is reduced.)

384
00:11:57,460 --> 00:11:58,650
Darn it!

385
00:11:58,650 --> 00:12:00,200
(It fails again.)

386
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:01,600
Darn it!

387
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:03,600
- Like this! Like this!
- Okay!

388
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:05,020
Let me.

389
00:12:05,790 --> 00:12:08,000
(No matter how much I try,)

390
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,300
(this balloon is quite sturdy.)

391
00:12:09,300 --> 00:12:11,800
- Hold on.
- What is this thing?

392
00:12:12,210 --> 00:12:13,740
Why isn't this working?

393
00:12:14,380 --> 00:12:16,900
He can't even make us laugh.

394
00:12:17,540 --> 00:12:18,670
Here he comes.

395
00:12:18,670 --> 00:12:20,980
Show us.

396
00:12:20,980 --> 00:12:23,250
- This is your last chance.
- I'll make you laugh.

397
00:12:23,250 --> 00:12:25,590
Are you ready for it?

398
00:12:25,590 --> 00:12:27,860
- Let's go.
- Ready, set, go.

399
00:12:27,860 --> 00:12:29,490
("Frozen")

400
00:12:29,490 --> 00:12:31,650
It's a cold world.

401
00:12:31,650 --> 00:12:33,460
(They get it immediately.)

402
00:12:33,460 --> 00:12:34,790
- A cold world?
- Is it the kingdom?

403
00:12:34,790 --> 00:12:36,100
- A cold world?
- I think so.

404
00:12:36,100 --> 00:12:37,290
Here we go again.

405
00:12:38,370 --> 00:12:40,290
The answer is weird.

406
00:12:40,290 --> 00:12:42,160
No, just try it.

407
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:44,560
A cold world? Ice world?

408
00:12:45,010 --> 00:12:46,010
"Tears of the Antarctic".

409
00:12:46,010 --> 00:12:48,030
It could be "Frozen II".

410
00:12:48,030 --> 00:12:49,900
There's also that other movie...

411
00:12:49,900 --> 00:12:52,140
starring Song Kang Ho.
That train movie.

412
00:12:52,140 --> 00:12:53,450
- "Snowpiercer".
- "Snowpiercer".

413
00:12:53,450 --> 00:12:54,620
"Snowpiercer"?

414
00:12:54,620 --> 00:12:55,680
(He's embarrassed.)

415
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:56,680
(He has nothing left to say.)

416
00:12:56,680 --> 00:12:58,450
- Merry...
- Just say the answer.

417
00:12:59,810 --> 00:13:01,260
He gave up.

418
00:13:01,550 --> 00:13:03,180
Just say it.

419
00:13:03,180 --> 00:13:04,490
- Just say it. You got it.
- Hey.

420
00:13:04,490 --> 00:13:06,020
- You got the answer.
- I wanted to help.

421
00:13:06,130 --> 00:13:08,230
- This is the end.
- What's your answer?

422
00:13:08,230 --> 00:13:09,290
- "Frozen".
- "Frozen".

423
00:13:09,290 --> 00:13:10,420
Yes!

424
00:13:10,420 --> 00:13:12,390
- Goodness.
- How long will this last?

425
00:13:12,390 --> 00:13:15,430
It's not that he's boring.

426
00:13:15,430 --> 00:13:17,710
It's just impossible for him
to be fun.

427
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:19,110
(He's funny, uninteresting,
and has no screen time.)

428
00:13:19,110 --> 00:13:20,670
- It's impossible.
- You're right.

429
00:13:20,670 --> 00:13:21,980
Come on.

430
00:13:21,980 --> 00:13:23,400
That one was easy.

431
00:13:23,400 --> 00:13:24,750
- I bet your game...
- Kyung-hwan is...

432
00:13:24,750 --> 00:13:26,640
will be shown in a small box
on the right-hand corner.

433
00:13:26,850 --> 00:13:28,480
It'll be shown briefly.

434
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:31,180
- They'll charge the audience.
- They do that when it's boring.

435
00:13:31,180 --> 00:13:32,220
("Tidal Wave", "Highway Star")

436
00:13:32,220 --> 00:13:34,010
(Their game is shown in the box.
Although it wasn't fun,)

437
00:13:34,010 --> 00:13:35,260
(they got everything right
and receive a hint.)

438
00:13:35,260 --> 00:13:37,960
Since you got everything right,
I'll give you a hint.

439
00:13:38,490 --> 00:13:40,650
- Here comes the hint.
- Are we finally getting one?

440
00:13:40,650 --> 00:13:41,650
(What kind of hint will it be?)

441
00:13:41,650 --> 00:13:43,790
The directors...

442
00:13:43,790 --> 00:13:46,130
(The directors...)

443
00:13:47,240 --> 00:13:50,370
(During the 1st mission,
they received a hint.)

444
00:13:50,370 --> 00:13:55,540
(Yoyomi and Tae Oh were suspected.)

445
00:13:55,540 --> 00:13:58,720
(Will the hint be about them?)

446
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:00,950
The directors...

447
00:14:01,380 --> 00:14:06,590
debuted more than three years ago.
Yoyomi isn't included.

448
00:14:06,590 --> 00:14:08,120
(Yoyomi is not on the list.)

449
00:14:08,120 --> 00:14:09,520
- It's not Yoyomi.
- No way.

450
00:14:09,520 --> 00:14:11,520
We were all suspecting her.

451
00:14:11,520 --> 00:14:12,920
- One of the directors is among...
- She was suspicious back there.

452
00:14:12,920 --> 00:14:14,330
So Min, Ji Hyo, and Hyosung.

453
00:14:14,330 --> 00:14:15,560
It's not me.

454
00:14:15,560 --> 00:14:17,700
- It's not me either.
- It's So Min or...

455
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:19,530
We were young.

456
00:14:19,530 --> 00:14:21,060
(One of the directors is among
So Min, Ji Hyo, and Hyosung.)

457
00:14:21,630 --> 00:14:23,630
All right. You need to protect
the national actor...

458
00:14:23,630 --> 00:14:25,800
and eliminate the directors.

459
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:27,240
The final mission is called
I Am an Actor.

460
00:14:27,530 --> 00:14:28,630
I hate this position.

461
00:14:28,630 --> 00:14:30,170
Hints regarding the directors
and the national actor...

462
00:14:30,170 --> 00:14:31,750
are hidden throughout this building.

463
00:14:31,750 --> 00:14:33,310
You must obtain them.
During the two trials...

464
00:14:33,310 --> 00:14:34,880
that take place every 30 minutes,

465
00:14:35,010 --> 00:14:36,950
you must eliminate the directors.

466
00:14:36,950 --> 00:14:38,720
If you do, the national actor
and the actors win.

467
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:40,260
If the national actor
is eliminated...

468
00:14:40,260 --> 00:14:42,920
or if you fail to eliminate
the directors during the two trials,

469
00:14:43,090 --> 00:14:46,150
the directors win.
The losing team will be penalized.

470
00:14:46,700 --> 00:14:48,050
Before the trial,

471
00:14:48,050 --> 00:14:50,160
only the directors
and the national actor...

472
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:51,760
can remove the name tags.

473
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:54,970
The other actors can only
eliminate them through the trials.

474
00:14:55,030 --> 00:14:56,760
However, if the directors
and the national actor...

475
00:14:56,760 --> 00:14:58,560
eliminate three actors,

476
00:14:58,560 --> 00:15:01,580
they will lose,
and the game will come to an end.

477
00:15:02,010 --> 00:15:04,450
So the actors can't remove
the directors' name tags?

478
00:15:04,450 --> 00:15:05,720
No, they can only do that
through the trials.

479
00:15:05,720 --> 00:15:06,950
Only through the trials.

480
00:15:06,950 --> 00:15:08,880
But we can help
the national actor, right?

481
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:11,120
We can grab the directors
or twist their arms.

482
00:15:11,450 --> 00:15:13,550
- Or make them faint.
- Correct.

483
00:15:13,550 --> 00:15:15,010
We can do that.

484
00:15:15,010 --> 00:15:17,360
- You can't rip their name tags.
- Got it.

485
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:18,590
Once you've moved
to your locations,

486
00:15:18,590 --> 00:15:20,890
- we'll start the race.
- Let's go!

487
00:15:21,890 --> 00:15:24,870
Ever since the beginning,

488
00:15:25,390 --> 00:15:27,790
Haha seemed a bit awkward.

489
00:15:27,790 --> 00:15:29,660
I'm suspicious.

490
00:15:29,660 --> 00:15:31,340
I think Tae Oh has a distinct role.

491
00:15:31,340 --> 00:15:33,080
He's either a director
or the national actor.

492
00:15:33,770 --> 00:15:36,140
I don't need to explain
about Tae Oh's actions.

493
00:15:36,950 --> 00:15:38,640
He's making it very obvious.

494
00:15:38,640 --> 00:15:40,510
I think Hyosung
is the female director.

495
00:15:41,380 --> 00:15:44,250
I glanced at her during our break,

496
00:15:44,620 --> 00:15:46,260
and she had a suspicious gaze.

497
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:48,260
I think it's Tae Oh and So Min.

498
00:15:48,260 --> 00:15:49,360
(Kwang Soo suspects these two.)

499
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:52,650
I have no idea
who the national actor is.

500
00:15:53,330 --> 00:15:55,460
I hope Kyung-hwan
is one of the directors.

501
00:15:55,460 --> 00:15:57,730
That way,
he'll get some screen time.

502
00:15:57,730 --> 00:15:58,870
(This is a wish of his.)

503
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:03,560
This is my last chance
to get my screen time.

504
00:16:04,060 --> 00:16:06,800
If this doesn't work,
and you guys invite me again,

505
00:16:06,840 --> 00:16:08,110
I won't come back.

506
00:16:08,110 --> 00:16:09,170
(He's more focused
on gaining more screen time.)

507
00:16:09,170 --> 00:16:11,250
- This is my last chance.
- The race will begin now.

508
00:16:11,250 --> 00:16:12,270
(The announcement
for the start of the race is given.)

509
00:16:12,270 --> 00:16:13,270
Five,

510
00:16:13,350 --> 00:16:14,380
four,

511
00:16:14,450 --> 00:16:15,450
three,

512
00:16:15,880 --> 00:16:16,880
two,

513
00:16:17,140 --> 00:16:18,220
one.

514
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:21,010
You may begin.

515
00:16:21,010 --> 00:16:23,730
Where should I go?

516
00:16:23,730 --> 00:16:24,730
What are you doing?

517
00:16:24,730 --> 00:16:26,230
I'm searching.

518
00:16:26,230 --> 00:16:28,290
I'm looking for hints.

519
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:29,660
You're an actor, right?

520
00:16:29,660 --> 00:16:30,660
(He asks
a straightforward question.)

521
00:16:30,660 --> 00:16:31,730
Yes.

522
00:16:32,500 --> 00:16:34,560
(Yes, so what?)

523
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:36,370
I don't need to worry
about you then.

524
00:16:36,370 --> 00:16:37,400
(He's daunted.)

525
00:16:37,900 --> 00:16:39,170
Why? What about you?

526
00:16:39,400 --> 00:16:40,630
I'm an actor too.

527
00:16:41,110 --> 00:16:42,980
- In which genre?
- What?

528
00:16:42,980 --> 00:16:44,250
Variety shows.

529
00:16:44,400 --> 00:16:45,480
I act in variety shows.

530
00:16:45,480 --> 00:16:47,950
If you're a national actor,
let me know so I'll protect you.

531
00:16:47,950 --> 00:16:48,950
Of course.

532
00:16:48,950 --> 00:16:50,720
Wait, there's a hint.

533
00:16:51,350 --> 00:16:53,090
(Kyung-hwan finds a hint.)

534
00:16:53,650 --> 00:16:55,050
There's a hint. Okay.

535
00:16:55,050 --> 00:16:57,230
- Let's read it together.
- No, we shouldn't.

536
00:16:57,230 --> 00:16:58,920
That's how we do it.

537
00:16:58,920 --> 00:17:00,920
We always share the hints.

538
00:17:00,920 --> 00:17:01,920
(Brushing off stubbornly)

539
00:17:02,230 --> 00:17:03,660
- What was that?
- Fine.

540
00:17:03,660 --> 00:17:06,760
- What? This is fine.
- Okay, okay.

541
00:17:06,760 --> 00:17:07,930
Let's see.

542
00:17:08,200 --> 00:17:10,760
"Director A
is a Running Man member."

543
00:17:10,760 --> 00:17:13,330
(Director A
is a Running Man member.)

544
00:17:13,740 --> 00:17:16,210
(Director A
is a Running Man member.)

545
00:17:16,210 --> 00:17:18,650
It's not me, see?
It's a Running Man member.

546
00:17:18,650 --> 00:17:20,250
But we don't know
who Director B is.

547
00:17:20,250 --> 00:17:23,310
- I see.
- Director A could be a female.

548
00:17:24,010 --> 00:17:26,220
Why do you think Director A
is a male?

549
00:17:27,390 --> 00:17:29,230
I have a lot of guy friends
who have blood type A.

550
00:17:29,230 --> 00:17:30,490
Anyway...

551
00:17:31,080 --> 00:17:33,430
Are you in bad condition?

552
00:17:33,430 --> 00:17:34,760
(Yes)

553
00:17:35,500 --> 00:17:36,970
Where do I keep this?

554
00:17:36,970 --> 00:17:38,900
Someone's here. Hide it.

555
00:17:38,900 --> 00:17:40,760
(He hides it.)

556
00:17:41,170 --> 00:17:42,240
Ji Hyo.

557
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:43,910
(Ji Hyo is also suspected
of being a director.)

558
00:17:43,910 --> 00:17:45,600
- Have you been well?
- Yes.

559
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:47,240
You just saw her a while ago.

560
00:17:47,240 --> 00:17:49,010
I bet it'll come down...

561
00:17:49,010 --> 00:17:50,870
- to either So Min or me.
- Why do you say that?

562
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:54,420
- That was random.
- Those two are similar.

563
00:17:54,420 --> 00:17:56,340
Yoyomi was excluded,
so it's Hyosung, me,

564
00:17:56,340 --> 00:17:57,490
- or So Min.
- So Min.

565
00:17:57,490 --> 00:17:59,850
I'm certain it's not me,
so I suspect them.

566
00:17:59,850 --> 00:18:02,990
If it's one of them, I pick So Min.

567
00:18:02,990 --> 00:18:05,490
And back at the bus...

568
00:18:05,490 --> 00:18:06,520
(Ji Hyo suspects So Min.)

569
00:18:06,520 --> 00:18:07,930
So Min seemed suspicious.

570
00:18:07,930 --> 00:18:09,520
If So Min was the director,
wouldn't it be too easy?

571
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:11,360
(Why is she suddenly accusing her?)

572
00:18:11,730 --> 00:18:13,740
(Jae Suk gets into the elevator.)

573
00:18:13,740 --> 00:18:14,830
Which floor are you going to?

574
00:18:16,170 --> 00:18:18,260
Hey. Hey!

575
00:18:19,010 --> 00:18:21,410
(It's so fun to tease Kwang Soo.)

576
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:24,210
What's wrong with him?

577
00:18:24,570 --> 00:18:26,040
Why is he acting this way?

578
00:18:26,040 --> 00:18:27,110
That was hilarious.

579
00:18:27,110 --> 00:18:28,420
(This is worse than getting
your text messages ignored.)

580
00:18:28,420 --> 00:18:30,650
My time with Kwang Woo
is always fun.

581
00:18:30,650 --> 00:18:32,510
(Now that he's had his fun,)

582
00:18:32,510 --> 00:18:34,310
(he looks around for the hints.)

583
00:18:34,310 --> 00:18:35,310
What?

584
00:18:36,260 --> 00:18:38,960
(He finds a box with an R sticker.)

585
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:40,590
What is this?

586
00:18:40,590 --> 00:18:42,730
(What could it be?)

587
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:44,560
What is this?

588
00:18:44,560 --> 00:18:45,620
(It's a tablet.)

589
00:18:45,620 --> 00:18:46,760
It's a tablet.

590
00:18:46,970 --> 00:18:48,900
Is this the hint?

591
00:18:51,260 --> 00:18:53,910
I am Kim Yoon Sang
of "That I Want to Know".

592
00:18:54,410 --> 00:18:56,770
(What is "That I Want to Know"?)

593
00:18:56,770 --> 00:18:59,150
In order to find out the truth...

594
00:18:59,150 --> 00:19:01,420
about these two directors,
we've talked...

595
00:19:01,420 --> 00:19:03,110
with their close associates.

596
00:19:03,920 --> 00:19:07,350
I know Director A.

597
00:19:07,350 --> 00:19:08,960
How do I put it?

598
00:19:09,080 --> 00:19:10,660
I think I could say this.

599
00:19:10,890 --> 00:19:13,590
"Running Man's fan-meet",
"tears".

600
00:19:13,590 --> 00:19:15,520
"Running Man's fan-meet",
"tears"?

601
00:19:17,020 --> 00:19:20,360
One of the directors is related
to tears.

602
00:19:20,360 --> 00:19:23,210
Who is Director A?

603
00:19:24,170 --> 00:19:27,030
I got this. I know who it is.

604
00:19:27,030 --> 00:19:28,270
(Jae Suk knows who it is.)

605
00:19:28,270 --> 00:19:29,300
Goodness.

606
00:19:29,480 --> 00:19:30,710
Did you get a hint?

607
00:19:31,340 --> 00:19:32,680
I can't read it.

608
00:19:32,680 --> 00:19:34,040
They have dignity?

609
00:19:35,250 --> 00:19:36,250
(She misreads "director"
as "dignity".)

610
00:19:36,250 --> 00:19:38,150
How could you misread this?

611
00:19:38,220 --> 00:19:40,190
- Is it dignity?
- Who cried during the fan-meet?

612
00:19:41,420 --> 00:19:42,550
Who was it?

613
00:19:42,550 --> 00:19:43,780
(Who cried during the fan-meet?)

614
00:19:43,780 --> 00:19:44,820
I'm dying to know.

615
00:19:45,160 --> 00:19:46,960
- I want to search it up online.
- It's Ji Hyo.

616
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:48,460
(Ji Hyo was the one who cried.)

617
00:19:49,620 --> 00:19:52,530
(During the fan-meet,
Ji Hyo shed tears.)

618
00:19:52,530 --> 00:19:55,670
(Does this mean
she's one of the directors?)

619
00:19:55,670 --> 00:19:56,830
- Ji Hyo.
- Yes?

620
00:19:56,830 --> 00:19:58,140
(He immediately goes to her.)

621
00:19:58,140 --> 00:19:59,640
I found a hint.

622
00:19:59,640 --> 00:20:00,710
Was it about me?

623
00:20:00,710 --> 00:20:03,040
It read "Running Man's fan-meet",
"tears".

624
00:20:03,040 --> 00:20:04,910
It's really not me.

625
00:20:05,810 --> 00:20:08,920
- This is too obvious.
- I'm serious.

626
00:20:09,650 --> 00:20:12,780
I'm just frustrated that's all.
It's seriously not me.

627
00:20:12,780 --> 00:20:14,220
- Let go of me.
- It isn't me.

628
00:20:14,220 --> 00:20:15,310
Don't be clingy.

629
00:20:15,990 --> 00:20:17,780
- Yoo Jae Suk!
- Go away.

630
00:20:17,780 --> 00:20:20,320
You'll pay
if you leave me like this.

631
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:22,160
- Don't follow me.
- It isn't me.

632
00:20:22,160 --> 00:20:24,120
- Don't come any closer.
- It isn't me!

633
00:20:24,120 --> 00:20:25,360
Be quiet.

634
00:20:25,830 --> 00:20:27,790
Unbelievable.

635
00:20:28,470 --> 00:20:30,760
I knew I'd be suspected this way.

636
00:20:31,910 --> 00:20:33,030
(Who's the national actor?)

637
00:20:33,030 --> 00:20:36,340
Is everyone
thinking of the same person?

638
00:20:36,340 --> 00:20:37,600
(They only know about
the directors right now,)

639
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:38,870
(but So Min spots something.)

640
00:20:38,870 --> 00:20:41,770
(Who is the hint about?)

641
00:20:41,770 --> 00:20:45,310
(The national actor's age
doesn't include the number 9.)

642
00:20:45,810 --> 00:20:47,990
(In 2019, Kyung-hwan and Ji Hyo
were both 39.)

643
00:20:48,690 --> 00:20:51,190
(Neither Kyung-hwan nor Ji Hyo
is the national actor.)

644
00:20:51,190 --> 00:20:52,820
"Doesn't include..."

645
00:20:53,020 --> 00:20:54,700
- Did you find something?
- A hint.

646
00:20:54,700 --> 00:20:56,820
(It's Ji Hyo who many
suspect as a director.)

647
00:20:57,320 --> 00:20:58,470
What did it say?

648
00:20:59,970 --> 00:21:02,510
Wait, hold on.

649
00:21:03,240 --> 00:21:04,470
You're just leaving?

650
00:21:04,710 --> 00:21:06,240
I can't show you this.

651
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:07,530
- It's fine.
- I'd only show you...

652
00:21:07,530 --> 00:21:09,300
- if I'm a director.
- I've been suspecting you,

653
00:21:09,300 --> 00:21:10,800
- so you're not showing me...
- Look.

654
00:21:10,800 --> 00:21:12,720
It's about the national actor,
so what if you're a director?

655
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:15,610
I'm just an actor,
so I should help the national actor.

656
00:21:15,610 --> 00:21:17,450
One of the directors is female.

657
00:21:17,450 --> 00:21:19,310
(Does she want to know so that she
can eliminate the national actor?)

658
00:21:19,310 --> 00:21:21,420
(Meanwhile, Haha
is still searching for hints.)

659
00:21:22,390 --> 00:21:23,890
(He spots something.)

660
00:21:24,760 --> 00:21:26,430
(He finds a box with the R logo.)

661
00:21:26,430 --> 00:21:27,700
What's this?

662
00:21:27,700 --> 00:21:29,050
(It's a tablet
that contains a video.)

663
00:21:29,050 --> 00:21:30,170
Hold on.

664
00:21:30,520 --> 00:21:33,030
I am Kim Yoon Sang
of "That I Want to Know".

665
00:21:33,640 --> 00:21:35,500
The two directors
desperately want to know...

666
00:21:35,500 --> 00:21:37,300
the identity of the national actor.

667
00:21:37,300 --> 00:21:41,010
I met with a close acquaintance
of this person.

668
00:21:41,210 --> 00:21:42,680
Maybe it's a quality
of a national actor.

669
00:21:42,680 --> 00:21:44,410
This person is generous
and is a skillful actor.

670
00:21:44,410 --> 00:21:46,920
I almost forgot.
This person goes by a stage name.

671
00:21:46,920 --> 00:21:48,870
(The national actor
goes by a stage name?)

672
00:21:48,870 --> 00:21:50,750
I don't mind this person's
actual name though.

673
00:21:50,750 --> 00:21:54,080
This person goes by a stage name.

674
00:21:54,990 --> 00:21:57,190
So who is this national actor?

675
00:21:58,320 --> 00:21:59,790
(Someone with a stage name...)

676
00:21:59,790 --> 00:22:01,230
(who isn't of an age
that includes a 9.)

677
00:22:01,230 --> 00:22:02,900
This is huge.

678
00:22:02,900 --> 00:22:04,520
(National actor candidates:
Kang Tae Oh, Haha, Yoyomi)

679
00:22:04,620 --> 00:22:07,860
This was the biggest hint ever.

680
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,410
This seems weird. Wait, what's that?

681
00:22:12,140 --> 00:22:13,410
Haha, did you find a hint?

682
00:22:13,410 --> 00:22:14,600
Not at all. What was that?

683
00:22:14,600 --> 00:22:15,710
- Did you find a hint?
- Yes.

684
00:22:15,710 --> 00:22:17,100
Regarding whom?

685
00:22:17,800 --> 00:22:19,680
I have more on the national actor.

686
00:22:19,920 --> 00:22:21,480
- The national actor?
- What about you?

687
00:22:21,720 --> 00:22:25,650
I have two regarding
the national actor...

688
00:22:25,720 --> 00:22:26,720
and one about the directors.

689
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:28,050
- Tell me about the directors.
- What are you though?

690
00:22:28,050 --> 00:22:30,190
- Are you just an actor?
- Yes.

691
00:22:30,620 --> 00:22:32,190
- What about you?
- I've...

692
00:22:32,190 --> 00:22:34,730
seen you lie on TV too much
that I can't trust you.

693
00:22:34,730 --> 00:22:35,730
Whatever. Forget about it.

694
00:22:35,730 --> 00:22:37,200
(Subtly)

695
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:38,320
Forget about it.

696
00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:39,830
(Tae Oh tried
to rip of Haha's name tag.)

697
00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:41,900
What?
Why are you making me look bad?

698
00:22:41,900 --> 00:22:43,470
I felt your hand just now.

699
00:22:43,470 --> 00:22:45,330
Anyway, share whatever you find.

700
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:47,410
You're being very suspicious though.

701
00:22:48,600 --> 00:22:50,600
(He's acting super suspicious.)

702
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:54,770
(Haha follows Tae Oh.)

703
00:22:55,010 --> 00:22:56,080
Are you sure?

704
00:22:56,080 --> 00:22:57,420
(Out of the blue)

705
00:22:58,040 --> 00:23:00,280
- Sorry?
- I'll tell you what I know.

706
00:23:01,050 --> 00:23:02,220
It's hard to guess who though.

707
00:23:02,220 --> 00:23:04,350
- Write this down.
- Sure.

708
00:23:04,350 --> 00:23:05,620
(While Tae Oh is preoccupied)

709
00:23:05,620 --> 00:23:07,430
(Ripping)

710
00:23:08,730 --> 00:23:11,360
(While his guard was down)

711
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:12,940
(A blitz attack)

712
00:23:13,290 --> 00:23:15,240
(Haha eliminates Tae Oh
who could be a director.)

713
00:23:15,240 --> 00:23:16,410
I'm sorry, Tae Oh.

714
00:23:16,410 --> 00:23:18,300
I know that you're
the national actor.

715
00:23:18,300 --> 00:23:20,530
(I know that you're
the national actor.)

716
00:23:20,800 --> 00:23:23,770
(You think I'm the national actor?)

717
00:23:24,870 --> 00:23:27,980
(This morning, they all checked
the roles they were playing.)

718
00:23:27,980 --> 00:23:29,610
(Haha...)

719
00:23:29,610 --> 00:23:33,110
(is a director!)

720
00:23:33,110 --> 00:23:35,510
(Haha was chosen
for the role of a director.)

721
00:23:35,510 --> 00:23:36,820
You're the national actor, right?

722
00:23:36,820 --> 00:23:39,820
(Haha guessed it was Tae Oh
because he uses a stage name.)

723
00:23:39,820 --> 00:23:40,900
You're just an actor?

724
00:23:40,900 --> 00:23:42,160
(The twist)

725
00:23:42,160 --> 00:23:44,290
- Unbelievable.
- You're not the national actor?

726
00:23:44,290 --> 00:23:46,090
(Tae Oh acted suspiciously all day,)

727
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:48,290
(but he wasn't a director
nor the national actor.)

728
00:23:48,290 --> 00:23:49,640
(He was just an actor.)

729
00:23:49,640 --> 00:23:51,970
(Actor)

730
00:23:52,300 --> 00:23:55,640
But you use a stage name
just like me and Yoyomi.

731
00:23:56,600 --> 00:23:58,510
I was too naive.

732
00:23:58,510 --> 00:24:00,840
Sorry, Tae Oh. I'll explain later.

733
00:24:00,870 --> 00:24:02,220
No way.

734
00:24:02,840 --> 00:24:04,890
Does it always end in vain?

735
00:24:05,580 --> 00:24:07,010
What's up?

736
00:24:07,460 --> 00:24:09,820
(Haha comes across Jae Suk.)

737
00:24:10,280 --> 00:24:12,190
(Haha laughs awkwardly.)

738
00:24:12,190 --> 00:24:13,900
You won't believe it.

739
00:24:13,900 --> 00:24:16,120
I learned about the national actor.

740
00:24:16,230 --> 00:24:17,730
- You found a hint?
- The biggest one ever.

741
00:24:17,970 --> 00:24:19,940
(He must've found it over here.)

742
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:21,900
- What now?
- Gosh.

743
00:24:22,860 --> 00:24:24,240
Kang Tae Oh has been eliminated.

744
00:24:24,560 --> 00:24:25,670
(Jae Suk spots Tae Oh
who was just eliminated.)

745
00:24:25,670 --> 00:24:26,870
Kang Tae Oh has been eliminated.

746
00:24:26,870 --> 00:24:27,910
You've been eliminated?

747
00:24:27,910 --> 00:24:30,450
Actor Kang Tae Oh
has been eliminated.

748
00:24:30,450 --> 00:24:31,540
Wait.

749
00:24:31,770 --> 00:24:33,040
Please get him.

750
00:24:33,040 --> 00:24:34,180
(Only those with a special role
can eliminate others.)

751
00:24:34,180 --> 00:24:36,450
Actor Kang Tae Oh
has been eliminated.

752
00:24:36,450 --> 00:24:37,510
- What?
- What?

753
00:24:37,510 --> 00:24:39,280
- Tae Oh was eliminated?
- Tae Oh?

754
00:24:39,280 --> 00:24:41,490
- It's Haha.
- It's obvious now.

755
00:24:41,510 --> 00:24:42,510
(They suspect those
who aren't here with them.)

756
00:24:42,510 --> 00:24:43,730
That narrows it down.

757
00:24:43,730 --> 00:24:45,160
I suspect Haha.

758
00:24:45,160 --> 00:24:46,260
Did you eliminate Tae Oh?

759
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:49,230
(Haha was caught red-handed.)

760
00:24:49,230 --> 00:24:50,290
I'm the national actor.

761
00:24:50,820 --> 00:24:53,360
- What?
- I know something huge.

762
00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:56,100
Why was Tae Oh eliminated
when he was only with you?

763
00:24:56,940 --> 00:25:00,030
I thought that he was a director.

764
00:25:00,600 --> 00:25:03,710
I'm telling the truth.
I know something huge.

765
00:25:03,710 --> 00:25:05,340
- I'm not lying.
- 30 minutes have passed.

766
00:25:05,340 --> 00:25:08,310
- Please gather at the court.
- We'll see at the trial.

767
00:25:08,310 --> 00:25:09,510
I'm sure of it.

768
00:25:09,510 --> 00:25:10,920
You should head to the court.

769
00:25:10,920 --> 00:25:12,280
- The court.
- He was faking it.

770
00:25:12,280 --> 00:25:13,780
We should continue this later on.

771
00:25:13,780 --> 00:25:15,760
- Let's head to court first.
- Jae Suk, trust me.

772
00:25:15,920 --> 00:25:17,020
You really should.

773
00:25:17,190 --> 00:25:19,790
If I could,
I would show you the video.

774
00:25:19,790 --> 00:25:21,730
(What will happen
at the first trial?)

775
00:25:21,960 --> 00:25:24,320
I know it's confusing, but trust me.

776
00:25:24,320 --> 00:25:26,090
So you're the national actor?

777
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:28,400
Gosh, keep it down!

778
00:25:28,740 --> 00:25:31,100
- Gosh.
- You shouldn't say anything.

779
00:25:31,100 --> 00:25:32,210
I don't believe you though.

780
00:25:32,210 --> 00:25:33,270
Jae Suk!

781
00:25:33,270 --> 00:25:34,800
(The others arrive at court.)

782
00:25:34,800 --> 00:25:36,100
Who eliminated Tae Oh?

783
00:25:36,100 --> 00:25:38,540
- Who eliminated him?
- Who was it?

784
00:25:38,540 --> 00:25:39,570
Tae Oh...

785
00:25:39,650 --> 00:25:42,990
Actor Kang Tae Oh was eliminated.

786
00:25:42,990 --> 00:25:44,920
Now, we will commence
the first trial.

787
00:25:44,920 --> 00:25:48,610
Please discuss among yourselves
and put one person on trial.

788
00:25:48,610 --> 00:25:50,730
I witnessed it.

789
00:25:50,730 --> 00:25:51,730
What happened?

790
00:25:52,280 --> 00:25:54,290
Haha and Tae Oh were together,

791
00:25:54,790 --> 00:25:56,430
but Tae Oh was eliminated.

792
00:25:56,430 --> 00:25:57,430
(The witness testifies.)

793
00:25:58,000 --> 00:25:59,740
(Haha pretends to be unfazed.)

794
00:26:00,260 --> 00:26:02,030
- What?
- Then it's obvious.

795
00:26:02,670 --> 00:26:04,600
(All he does is nod.)

796
00:26:04,600 --> 00:26:05,800
(Haha seems unfazed.)

797
00:26:05,800 --> 00:26:08,410
That's the expression he holds
when situations get awkward.

798
00:26:08,410 --> 00:26:10,540
(Jong Kook pretends
to be perceptive.)

799
00:26:11,750 --> 00:26:13,510
It's why I'm not saying anything.

800
00:26:13,510 --> 00:26:15,070
I'll only speak if I'm on trial.

801
00:26:15,070 --> 00:26:16,450
- I...
- That's right.

802
00:26:16,610 --> 00:26:18,610
I'm worried because
he could be the national actor.

803
00:26:18,610 --> 00:26:21,780
He could've thought that
Tae Oh was a director.

804
00:26:21,780 --> 00:26:23,430
I think we should protect him.

805
00:26:23,430 --> 00:26:24,430
It's definitely a risk.

806
00:26:24,430 --> 00:26:26,930
I have a feeling that
Haha's the national actor.

807
00:26:26,930 --> 00:26:29,430
He never puts on
a serious expression like that.

808
00:26:29,430 --> 00:26:32,620
There's a hint
that we all know though.

809
00:26:32,620 --> 00:26:35,790
It read "Running Man's fan-meet",
"tears".

810
00:26:35,790 --> 00:26:37,410
The hint that Jae Suk found.

811
00:26:37,410 --> 00:26:40,300
I'm confused because
that points to Ji Hyo.

812
00:26:40,300 --> 00:26:41,480
I saw that too,

813
00:26:41,480 --> 00:26:46,010
but the hints point
to Ji Hyo too directly...

814
00:26:46,010 --> 00:26:48,610
which is why we should
let her be for now.

815
00:26:48,610 --> 00:26:50,340
- So it's not her?
- It might not be.

816
00:26:50,340 --> 00:26:52,190
- It's to throw us off?
- How about this?

817
00:26:52,190 --> 00:26:56,010
Why don't we start by
narrowing down the female director?

818
00:26:56,010 --> 00:26:57,280
It has to be one of you.

819
00:26:57,280 --> 00:26:59,260
Yes, there are only
three possibilities.

820
00:26:59,260 --> 00:27:02,930
I spotted a lady
who let something slip by mistake.

821
00:27:02,930 --> 00:27:04,290
- What?
- In what way?

822
00:27:04,360 --> 00:27:05,790
It was Jeon So Min.

823
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:07,830
(I let something slip?)

824
00:27:07,830 --> 00:27:11,100
I told her about "tears"
being a hint that indicates...

825
00:27:11,100 --> 00:27:12,100
who the director is,

826
00:27:12,100 --> 00:27:14,270
but she claimed that tears
have never been...

827
00:27:14,270 --> 00:27:15,680
a hint to anything over three years.

828
00:27:15,680 --> 00:27:18,410
They never have been.
It hasn't happened before.

829
00:27:18,410 --> 00:27:19,980
Have you ever seen a hint like that?

830
00:27:20,220 --> 00:27:22,310
Then as she passed me,

831
00:27:22,890 --> 00:27:26,460
she said to herself that she has
never cried on the show.

832
00:27:27,660 --> 00:27:30,730
(Is Kyung-hwan telling the truth?)

833
00:27:30,730 --> 00:27:34,290
(Like he said,
he shared the hint with So Min.)

834
00:27:34,290 --> 00:27:36,730
(She didn't realize
she was saying it.)

835
00:27:36,730 --> 00:27:38,700
(I never cried at the fan-meet.)

836
00:27:39,400 --> 00:27:42,000
(Kyung-hwan was right!)

837
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:43,600
(Suspicious)

838
00:27:44,140 --> 00:27:47,330
(Did So Min make a huge mistake?)

839
00:27:47,830 --> 00:27:51,300
"I didn't cry, so how come
I'm one of the directors?"

840
00:27:51,510 --> 00:27:53,220
I've never cried on the show before.

841
00:27:53,220 --> 00:27:57,250
To be honest, I find it weird
not to put Ji Hyo on trial...

842
00:27:57,250 --> 00:27:59,220
after learning
what the hints indicated.

843
00:27:59,220 --> 00:28:01,850
- You're right.
- The staff of Running Man...

844
00:28:01,850 --> 00:28:04,620
would've written that
to indicate So Min.

845
00:28:04,620 --> 00:28:06,520
- As a twist?
- Yes, it's So Min.

846
00:28:06,520 --> 00:28:08,120
- I think it was to throw us off.
- Right?

847
00:28:08,120 --> 00:28:09,120
Don't you agree?

848
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:10,820
What about this then?

849
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:12,900
Let's put two
of the ladies on trial.

850
00:28:12,900 --> 00:28:14,900
(He didn't fully
comprehend the rules.)

851
00:28:15,590 --> 00:28:16,970
- What?
- Only one can be on trial.

852
00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:18,670
- Kwang Soo?
- Hold on.

853
00:28:18,670 --> 00:28:19,870
Seriously?

854
00:28:19,870 --> 00:28:20,870
Hold on then.

855
00:28:20,870 --> 00:28:22,800
Why don't we just put
three people on trial?

856
00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:25,710
- Unbelievable.
- I'm sorry.

857
00:28:25,710 --> 00:28:28,110
I think it's right
to put So Min on trial first.

858
00:28:28,340 --> 00:28:29,540
Me? That's out of the blue.

859
00:28:29,540 --> 00:28:32,540
I find So Min suspicious.

860
00:28:32,540 --> 00:28:35,220
Also, she hasn't said anything
up until now.

861
00:28:35,220 --> 00:28:36,780
There's nothing to say.

862
00:28:36,780 --> 00:28:39,620
Then make a rebuttal
and convince us otherwise.

863
00:28:39,730 --> 00:28:40,820
Well...

864
00:28:40,820 --> 00:28:43,230
We need to fish out
one of the directors.

865
00:28:43,230 --> 00:28:45,930
I think it's best
to find the female director first.

866
00:28:45,930 --> 00:28:48,330
- Right.
- Then let's take a vote...

867
00:28:48,470 --> 00:28:50,600
and put whoever receives
the most votes on trial.

868
00:28:50,600 --> 00:28:51,760
He's right.

869
00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:54,010
The person with the most votes
will be put on trial.

870
00:28:54,010 --> 00:28:56,450
- Okay.
- Then I'll write my own name.

871
00:28:56,450 --> 00:28:57,510
- What?
- Why?

872
00:28:57,510 --> 00:28:58,510
Go ahead and see who I am.

873
00:28:58,510 --> 00:29:00,650
- She's taking a risk.
- Exactly.

874
00:29:00,650 --> 00:29:04,110
She's taking a huge risk
to clear her name.

875
00:29:04,110 --> 00:29:05,780
Go ahead and vote then.

876
00:29:06,690 --> 00:29:08,050
Go ahead and vote then.

877
00:29:08,050 --> 00:29:09,780
What? I should place my vote?

878
00:29:09,780 --> 00:29:10,930
Yes, place your vote.

879
00:29:12,460 --> 00:29:16,000
- If I do, will you trust me?
- So Min, you're pushing it.

880
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:17,470
- What if it is you?
- I'm...

881
00:29:17,470 --> 00:29:20,740
Jae Suk wrote down your name and
is walking over to place his vote.

882
00:29:20,940 --> 00:29:22,560
- Guys.
- Can you place mine for me?

883
00:29:22,560 --> 00:29:24,860
Vote for me then.
Just know, that it isn't me.

884
00:29:24,860 --> 00:29:26,260
(She checks Jong Kook's ballot.)

885
00:29:26,260 --> 00:29:28,800
- It really isn't me.
- Place my vote for me.

886
00:29:28,800 --> 00:29:31,150
- But it isn't me.
- Place my vote, please.

887
00:29:31,150 --> 00:29:32,340
- So Min, here.
- I hear you.

888
00:29:33,150 --> 00:29:34,150
- I'm sorry.
- "Jeon So..."

889
00:29:34,150 --> 00:29:36,420
But all the hints point to Ji Hyo.

890
00:29:36,420 --> 00:29:37,510
- Wait.
- Place my vote.

891
00:29:37,510 --> 00:29:39,280
I swear that it isn't me.

892
00:29:39,280 --> 00:29:41,190
If So Min isn't the director,

893
00:29:41,190 --> 00:29:43,190
we should have the national actor...

894
00:29:43,190 --> 00:29:44,820
eliminate Ji Hyo and Yoyomi.

895
00:29:44,820 --> 00:29:47,700
- Exactly. Jong Kook's right.
- Right?

896
00:29:47,730 --> 00:29:48,930
Sure, got it.

897
00:29:48,930 --> 00:29:50,320
Here's the result.

898
00:29:50,320 --> 00:29:53,740
So Min received
9 votes out of 11...

899
00:29:53,740 --> 00:29:54,740
(The voting result)

900
00:29:54,740 --> 00:29:57,010
(So Min will be put on trial.)

901
00:29:57,010 --> 00:29:58,760
- Please stand on the platform.
- So Min, please head out.

902
00:29:58,760 --> 00:30:00,710
(Sighing)

903
00:30:00,710 --> 00:30:03,010
We have no other choice.
It's a process of elimination.

904
00:30:03,010 --> 00:30:05,750
I don't get why no one wrote down...

905
00:30:06,100 --> 00:30:07,920
Hyosung's name.

906
00:30:07,920 --> 00:30:09,110
I doubt it's her.

907
00:30:09,110 --> 00:30:10,950
- There are no hints on me.
- We have no hints about her.

908
00:30:10,990 --> 00:30:13,160
But if So Min turns out
not to be a director...

909
00:30:13,260 --> 00:30:14,580
If she turns out
not to be a director...

910
00:30:14,990 --> 00:30:17,230
Then it's either Ji Hyo
or Hyosung.

911
00:30:17,230 --> 00:30:18,520
(Could Ji Hyo or Hyosung
be a director?)

912
00:30:18,520 --> 00:30:19,660
I'll rip it off now.

913
00:30:19,660 --> 00:30:20,850
(So Min's identity
will be revealed.)

914
00:30:20,850 --> 00:30:22,000
Let's do it.

915
00:30:22,160 --> 00:30:26,790
(Because of Kyung-hwan's testimony,
their fates have changed.)

916
00:30:26,790 --> 00:30:30,600
(What is So Min's identity?)

917
00:30:30,600 --> 00:30:31,640
- What is it?
- What is it?

918
00:30:33,100 --> 00:30:34,410
- What is it?
- She is a director!

919
00:30:34,530 --> 00:30:35,910
I told you!

920
00:30:36,010 --> 00:30:37,650
(I got caught.)

921
00:30:38,250 --> 00:30:39,300
(The director was not Ji Hyo,
but So Min.)

922
00:30:39,300 --> 00:30:40,870
I told you, right?

923
00:30:41,220 --> 00:30:42,570
(Shocked)

924
00:30:42,570 --> 00:30:43,810
So Min!

925
00:30:44,250 --> 00:30:46,610
Gosh, I can't trust you anymore.

926
00:30:46,760 --> 00:30:48,550
Seriously.

927
00:30:48,550 --> 00:30:51,160
(There is only one director
to catch now.)

928
00:30:51,160 --> 00:30:52,190
Guys, listen.

929
00:30:52,230 --> 00:30:54,400
So Min, an actor who has been
playing a director,

930
00:30:54,400 --> 00:30:56,400
is out now.

931
00:30:56,700 --> 00:30:59,560
So Min, who is an actor, is out.

932
00:31:00,260 --> 00:31:03,360
(Is So Min an actor?)

933
00:31:04,410 --> 00:31:06,030
So Min, who is a fake director,

934
00:31:06,030 --> 00:31:08,640
- is out.
- A fake director?

935
00:31:08,910 --> 00:31:10,100
What do you mean?

936
00:31:10,100 --> 00:31:12,840
(What is going on?)

937
00:31:13,950 --> 00:31:15,720
(Underneath her name tag,)

938
00:31:15,720 --> 00:31:17,690
(it said, "Actor whose role
is a director.")

939
00:31:18,220 --> 00:31:21,610
(So Min is not a female director.)

940
00:31:21,610 --> 00:31:23,850
So Min, who is an actor, is out.

941
00:31:23,850 --> 00:31:25,490
She is an actor?

942
00:31:26,700 --> 00:31:28,000
- What?
- Oh, that's right.

943
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:29,550
It says, "actor".

944
00:31:29,660 --> 00:31:30,760
Her role is a director.

945
00:31:30,760 --> 00:31:32,090
- She is an actor?
- What are you talking about?

946
00:31:32,120 --> 00:31:33,170
What's going on?

947
00:31:33,170 --> 00:31:35,090
She is an actor
whose role is a director.

948
00:31:35,090 --> 00:31:36,440
- What?
- What?

949
00:31:36,440 --> 00:31:37,800
- Then why...
- She plays a director...

950
00:31:37,800 --> 00:31:39,640
in the movie.

951
00:31:39,740 --> 00:31:41,830
- What's with her face?
- Why did you do that?

952
00:31:41,830 --> 00:31:43,770
- Are you a director or an actor?
- Aren't I a director?

953
00:31:44,340 --> 00:31:45,450
I don't know.

954
00:31:45,510 --> 00:31:48,680
- So Min...
- She thinks she is a director.

955
00:31:49,420 --> 00:31:50,510
What is going on?

956
00:31:50,510 --> 00:31:51,750
The staff tricked us.

957
00:31:51,780 --> 00:31:54,220
- There must be a twist.
- Something doesn't feel right.

958
00:31:54,220 --> 00:31:56,390
- Why is it so hard?
- What is this?

959
00:31:57,260 --> 00:31:58,430
All right.

960
00:31:58,520 --> 00:32:01,850
The court is adjourned.
Let's go back to the race.

961
00:32:01,850 --> 00:32:03,120
They may not know
what their roles are.

962
00:32:03,120 --> 00:32:04,760
Let's start the race again.

963
00:32:04,760 --> 00:32:06,260
She thinks she is a director.

964
00:32:06,260 --> 00:32:07,740
(Will they find the real directors
and the national actor?)

965
00:32:08,360 --> 00:32:09,470
I can't believe the staff.

966
00:32:09,560 --> 00:32:10,760
I mean...

967
00:32:11,140 --> 00:32:12,440
I'm so angry.

968
00:32:12,710 --> 00:32:14,480
I'm really angry.

969
00:32:14,480 --> 00:32:15,830
(She feels victimized.)

970
00:32:16,600 --> 00:32:18,180
Are you out?

971
00:32:18,570 --> 00:32:20,070
- Are you out?
- I got fooled.

972
00:32:20,070 --> 00:32:21,610
(She still feels victimized.)

973
00:32:21,610 --> 00:32:22,720
I got fooled too.

974
00:32:22,840 --> 00:32:24,540
I worked so hard,
but it was only a test.

975
00:32:25,390 --> 00:32:27,850
While saying that,

976
00:32:27,890 --> 00:32:29,780
- your eyes look so sad.
- Really?

977
00:32:29,780 --> 00:32:31,850
You're smiling,

978
00:32:31,850 --> 00:32:33,500
but you look very sad.
Why is that?

979
00:32:34,460 --> 00:32:35,930
I'm glad that you know.

980
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:37,400
I'm not just saying this.

981
00:32:37,400 --> 00:32:40,440
I didn't want to make you
feel uncomfortable,

982
00:32:40,740 --> 00:32:43,530
but I've always liked you a lot.

983
00:32:43,530 --> 00:32:45,470
(You've liked me a lot?)

984
00:32:45,470 --> 00:32:47,740
You're so charming on Running Man.

985
00:32:48,530 --> 00:32:49,640
I mean it.

986
00:32:49,640 --> 00:32:50,770
(So Min's heart flutters.)

987
00:32:50,910 --> 00:32:53,010
Maybe it's a good thing
that I got eliminated early.

988
00:32:53,010 --> 00:32:54,480
- Why?
- I can be here with you alone.

989
00:32:55,270 --> 00:32:56,990
(He feels a little uncomfortable.)

990
00:32:57,310 --> 00:32:58,610
Can you lock the door?

991
00:32:59,340 --> 00:33:00,580
I don't want anyone to come in.

992
00:33:01,080 --> 00:33:02,920
- You were so funny at that time.
- When?

993
00:33:02,920 --> 00:33:04,490
When your armpits got sweaty.

994
00:33:04,490 --> 00:33:07,260
(When your armpits got sweaty)

995
00:33:07,500 --> 00:33:08,790
That was...

996
00:33:09,020 --> 00:33:10,360
That was hilarious.

997
00:33:11,470 --> 00:33:12,670
Did you see Yondu too?

998
00:33:13,400 --> 00:33:14,530
I saw everything.

999
00:33:14,530 --> 00:33:16,030
(He really is a huge fan.)

1000
00:33:17,970 --> 00:33:19,980
There's the fish-shaped bun version,

1001
00:33:20,070 --> 00:33:21,270
but did you see
the fan-meet version too?

1002
00:33:21,270 --> 00:33:22,940
Like I said, I saw everything.

1003
00:33:24,650 --> 00:33:25,870
(Hopeless)

1004
00:33:25,870 --> 00:33:26,980
I see.

1005
00:33:26,980 --> 00:33:28,070
It was so funny.

1006
00:33:28,510 --> 00:33:31,540
I'm not teasing you though.

1007
00:33:32,250 --> 00:33:34,550
Can you marry a woman
who looks like Yondu?

1008
00:33:35,260 --> 00:33:37,430
(If I can marry her?)

1009
00:33:40,230 --> 00:33:42,050
(You said you like me a lot.)

1010
00:33:42,320 --> 00:33:43,560
Stop staring at me like that.
It's a bit uncomfortable.

1011
00:33:43,560 --> 00:33:45,500
I'm not.

1012
00:33:45,500 --> 00:33:47,590
(Tae Oh doesn't want her
to get any wrong ideas.)

1013
00:33:48,670 --> 00:33:50,560
Let's start the race again.

1014
00:33:50,560 --> 00:33:52,240
(The race starts again.)

1015
00:33:52,240 --> 00:33:53,410
This is crazy.

1016
00:33:53,530 --> 00:33:55,210
So Min is not a director.

1017
00:33:56,010 --> 00:33:57,270
Then what am I?

1018
00:33:57,980 --> 00:33:59,180
(So Min is an actor
whose role is a director.)

1019
00:33:59,180 --> 00:34:00,180
I'm...

1020
00:34:01,870 --> 00:34:04,280
I'm an actor
whose role is a director,

1021
00:34:04,280 --> 00:34:05,750
just like her.

1022
00:34:06,190 --> 00:34:09,690
The tablet PC said...

1023
00:34:10,080 --> 00:34:12,520
the national actor
goes by a stage name.

1024
00:34:12,890 --> 00:34:13,930
The candidates
are Haha, Song Ji Hyo,

1025
00:34:13,930 --> 00:34:14,930
Kang Tae Oh, and Yoyomi.

1026
00:34:15,330 --> 00:34:17,700
It's not Ji Hyo, Tae Oh, or me.

1027
00:34:17,700 --> 00:34:19,120
There was no reason
to eliminate Tae Oh.

1028
00:34:19,120 --> 00:34:20,770
(The only person left is...)

1029
00:34:20,770 --> 00:34:21,990
That leaves only Yoyomi.

1030
00:34:23,700 --> 00:34:27,040
(Is Yoyomi the national actor
as the hint suggests?)

1031
00:34:28,040 --> 00:34:30,450
They will suspect me now.

1032
00:34:31,870 --> 00:34:34,350
(Ji Hyo will be suspected
of being a director now.)

1033
00:34:34,350 --> 00:34:36,240
They will definitely suspect me.

1034
00:34:36,240 --> 00:34:37,450
(Is Ji Hyo a director?)

1035
00:34:37,990 --> 00:34:40,450
Let's hope the new hint...

1036
00:34:41,390 --> 00:34:43,020
will help us.

1037
00:34:43,020 --> 00:34:44,580
I have to find a hint.

1038
00:34:44,580 --> 00:34:45,620
(Everyone is looking for a hint.)

1039
00:34:46,930 --> 00:34:49,890
(Yoyomi, a national actor candidate,
finds something.)

1040
00:34:49,890 --> 00:34:52,970
(It's a hint.)

1041
00:34:55,660 --> 00:34:59,140
(Director A is not
in his or her 40s.)

1042
00:34:59,640 --> 00:35:02,510
(According to the hints
found so far,)

1043
00:35:02,510 --> 00:35:04,580
(Director A is
a Running Man member...)

1044
00:35:04,580 --> 00:35:06,100
(who is not in his or her 40s.)

1045
00:35:06,100 --> 00:35:08,370
(The candidates are...)

1046
00:35:08,370 --> 00:35:11,950
(Se Chan, Suk Jin,
Kwang Soo, and Ji Hyo.)

1047
00:35:12,850 --> 00:35:17,060
(Among them, who is a director?)

1048
00:35:18,560 --> 00:35:20,200
Does Kwang Soo have a role?

1049
00:35:20,350 --> 00:35:21,990
I don't think so.

1050
00:35:22,060 --> 00:35:23,220
- Me?
- Yes.

1051
00:35:23,490 --> 00:35:26,100
- Did you meet the staff earlier?
- No.

1052
00:35:26,100 --> 00:35:27,930
If I was a director,

1053
00:35:27,930 --> 00:35:30,470
- I would have hindered the game.
- Right.

1054
00:35:30,470 --> 00:35:31,510
Did you do anything wrong today?

1055
00:35:31,510 --> 00:35:33,310
- I made no mistakes today.
- No mistakes?

1056
00:35:33,740 --> 00:35:35,370
Okay. Am I a director then?

1057
00:35:35,370 --> 00:35:37,240
(Okay. Am I a director then?)

1058
00:35:37,240 --> 00:35:39,470
(What's with this guy?)

1059
00:35:39,470 --> 00:35:40,580
Bye.

1060
00:35:40,580 --> 00:35:41,910
(Their useless conversation
is over.)

1061
00:35:41,910 --> 00:35:43,910
I'll go downstairs.

1062
00:35:44,020 --> 00:35:45,490
(Just then)

1063
00:35:45,490 --> 00:35:47,310
(Kwang Soo looks around.)

1064
00:35:48,450 --> 00:35:52,490
(Making sure no one is around,
Kwang Soo follows Suk Jin.)

1065
00:35:53,950 --> 00:35:55,490
(He stares...)

1066
00:35:55,490 --> 00:35:57,290
(at Suk Jin's back.)

1067
00:35:58,020 --> 00:36:00,600
(Suk Jin looks back.)

1068
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:02,640
He is acting strange.

1069
00:36:02,830 --> 00:36:05,060
He is suspicious. Okay, I got it.

1070
00:36:05,270 --> 00:36:07,100
- You're being super suspicious.
- What?

1071
00:36:07,100 --> 00:36:08,830
You were watching me
from up there. Okay.

1072
00:36:08,830 --> 00:36:09,970
It was Kwang Soo.

1073
00:36:10,180 --> 00:36:11,450
It's Kwang Soo!

1074
00:36:11,450 --> 00:36:12,770
(He shouts it.)

1075
00:36:12,770 --> 00:36:15,350
Gosh, Kwang Soo was staring
at my name tag from up there.

1076
00:36:15,350 --> 00:36:17,390
(Kwang Soo, whose identity
is unknown, follows Seok JIn.)

1077
00:36:18,240 --> 00:36:20,350
Kwang Soo might think
I'm a director.

1078
00:36:21,560 --> 00:36:23,660
(If Kwang Soo thinks Suk Jin
is a director and targets him...)

1079
00:36:23,660 --> 00:36:24,830
That means...

1080
00:36:24,890 --> 00:36:26,580
Could Kwang Soo
be the national actor?

1081
00:36:27,890 --> 00:36:29,060
Suk Jin.

1082
00:36:29,350 --> 00:36:31,100
Kwang Soo,
are you the national actor?

1083
00:36:33,100 --> 00:36:34,270
You're the national actor,
aren't you?

1084
00:36:34,270 --> 00:36:35,700
(Nodding)

1085
00:36:35,700 --> 00:36:38,040
(Is Kwang Soo really
the national actor?)

1086
00:36:38,040 --> 00:36:39,060
Right?

1087
00:36:39,060 --> 00:36:41,580
(Kwang Soo
was the national actor.)

1088
00:36:41,580 --> 00:36:43,080
I'm just an actor.
I'm nothing special.

1089
00:36:43,410 --> 00:36:44,540
Do a good job.

1090
00:36:44,700 --> 00:36:47,140
- You should eliminate someone.
- I know.

1091
00:36:47,140 --> 00:36:48,640
- You have to.
- Right.

1092
00:36:48,870 --> 00:36:50,450
- I will.
- You have to.

1093
00:36:50,450 --> 00:36:51,950
Who... You have three chances...

1094
00:36:52,390 --> 00:36:54,950
(Just then)

1095
00:36:54,950 --> 00:36:56,310
You have three chances...

1096
00:36:56,310 --> 00:36:57,720
(Suk Jin's name tag
is ripped off.)

1097
00:36:57,720 --> 00:36:59,020
(Kwang Soo eliminates
a director candidate.)

1098
00:36:59,020 --> 00:37:00,330
What did you do?

1099
00:37:00,430 --> 00:37:02,450
Are you a director?
Are you the national actor?

1100
00:37:02,450 --> 00:37:03,770
(What is Suk Jin's identity?)

1101
00:37:03,770 --> 00:37:05,020
(Suk Jin is...)

1102
00:37:05,020 --> 00:37:07,330
(just an actor.)

1103
00:37:07,470 --> 00:37:08,700
Gosh.

1104
00:37:09,390 --> 00:37:10,810
(Kwang Soo got
Suk Jin's identity wrong...)

1105
00:37:10,810 --> 00:37:12,140
(and eliminated Suk Jin.)

1106
00:37:12,140 --> 00:37:15,010
(Then what is Kwang Soo's identity?)

1107
00:37:15,010 --> 00:37:17,450
Actor Ji Suk Jin is out.

1108
00:37:18,450 --> 00:37:20,910
Actor Ji Suk Jin is out.

1109
00:37:20,910 --> 00:37:22,080
Who?

1110
00:37:22,080 --> 00:37:23,410
(The Director A candidates are
Kwang Soo, Se Chan, and Ji Hyo.)

1111
00:37:23,410 --> 00:37:24,790
Suk Jin was an actor?

1112
00:37:24,890 --> 00:37:27,680
Suk Jin? Why was he eliminated?

1113
00:37:27,790 --> 00:37:31,220
Who eliminated him?

1114
00:37:32,080 --> 00:37:33,260
This is crazy.

1115
00:37:33,260 --> 00:37:35,160
(Kwang Soo could be either
a director or the national actor.)

1116
00:37:35,160 --> 00:37:37,290
(He looks for another hint.)

1117
00:37:39,100 --> 00:37:40,370
(Checking)

1118
00:37:40,370 --> 00:37:41,540
What?

1119
00:37:42,830 --> 00:37:46,100
(He finds a mysterious document.)

1120
00:37:47,580 --> 00:37:49,580
(Is there anyone around?)

1121
00:37:50,580 --> 00:37:51,770
What is this?

1122
00:37:52,350 --> 00:37:53,680
I almost missed it.

1123
00:37:53,680 --> 00:37:54,850
- It says, "R".
- What is it?

1124
00:37:54,850 --> 00:37:56,680
(Jong Kook finds a document too.)

1125
00:37:56,680 --> 00:37:58,390
- It's a scenario.
- "A Hint to You."

1126
00:37:58,390 --> 00:38:00,850
(It's titled, "A Hint to You".)

1127
00:38:01,160 --> 00:38:03,260
- Is it a scenario?
- It's a scenario.

1128
00:38:03,260 --> 00:38:04,660
(The document turns out
to be a scenario.)

1129
00:38:04,660 --> 00:38:05,760
Let's check it out.

1130
00:38:07,020 --> 00:38:10,370
"Each member, dressed as his
or her role, walks the red carpet."

1131
00:38:10,870 --> 00:38:12,020
(The producer
explains today's race.)

1132
00:38:12,020 --> 00:38:16,870
(The scenario describes
what they are shooting.)

1133
00:38:16,870 --> 00:38:19,600
(Haha and So Min,
the fake directors,)

1134
00:38:19,600 --> 00:38:22,640
(look happy
after checking their identities.)

1135
00:38:23,240 --> 00:38:24,410
It's Haha.

1136
00:38:24,410 --> 00:38:25,510
(Haha plays a director.)

1137
00:38:25,870 --> 00:38:28,370
(Haha is a fake director too.)

1138
00:38:28,370 --> 00:38:30,810
Look at this. It's Haha.

1139
00:38:31,410 --> 00:38:34,350
Haha thought he was a director.

1140
00:38:34,410 --> 00:38:35,620
I knew it.

1141
00:38:35,620 --> 00:38:37,930
That's why he was acting strange.

1142
00:38:37,930 --> 00:38:39,450
My hunch was right.

1143
00:38:39,450 --> 00:38:40,990
- He thought he was a director.
- Yes.

1144
00:38:41,260 --> 00:38:42,390
Right. Wait.

1145
00:38:42,560 --> 00:38:43,770
It was fake?

1146
00:38:46,020 --> 00:38:47,700
The video hint was fake.

1147
00:38:49,740 --> 00:38:53,060
(The members find
a fake video hint.)

1148
00:38:55,040 --> 00:38:57,470
(Running Man's fan-meet, tears)

1149
00:38:57,470 --> 00:38:59,950
(That means Ji Hyo.)

1150
00:38:59,950 --> 00:39:03,040
(The members believe the fake hint
and suspect regular actors.)

1151
00:39:03,040 --> 00:39:05,080
(Because of the fake hint,)

1152
00:39:05,080 --> 00:39:07,390
(Ji Hyo was suspected
of being a director.)

1153
00:39:07,390 --> 00:39:11,660
(If the hint was fake,
Ji Hyo might not be a director.)

1154
00:39:12,490 --> 00:39:16,830
(Haha found the second video hint.)

1155
00:39:17,700 --> 00:39:19,330
(This person goes by a stage name.)

1156
00:39:19,620 --> 00:39:22,100
(Believing the fake hint,)

1157
00:39:22,100 --> 00:39:24,810
(Haha eliminated Tae Oh.)

1158
00:39:24,810 --> 00:39:26,600
(If the hint was fake,)

1159
00:39:26,600 --> 00:39:28,540
(Yoyomi might not be
the national actor.)

1160
00:39:28,540 --> 00:39:30,580
But the hints from the staff
are true, right?

1161
00:39:31,770 --> 00:39:33,010
They're true, right?

1162
00:39:33,010 --> 00:39:35,310
(Only the written hints are true.)

1163
00:39:35,310 --> 00:39:37,490
"The producer informs
the real directors of hidden rules."

1164
00:39:37,490 --> 00:39:38,580
"The two real directors..."

1165
00:39:38,580 --> 00:39:40,290
"have to eliminate
Haha and So Min..."

1166
00:39:40,290 --> 00:39:42,890
"before eliminating
the national actor."

1167
00:39:44,660 --> 00:39:46,580
(After the two fake directors
are eliminated,)

1168
00:39:46,580 --> 00:39:48,760
(the real directors can
eliminate the national actor.)

1169
00:39:49,060 --> 00:39:51,620
(Oh, I see.)

1170
00:39:51,970 --> 00:39:53,490
We have to go protect Haha.

1171
00:39:54,660 --> 00:39:55,930
Haha is so stupid.

1172
00:39:56,370 --> 00:39:58,100
He makes it so obvious.

1173
00:39:58,100 --> 00:39:59,660
He loves his role.

1174
00:40:00,510 --> 00:40:03,680
Seriously, it's so confusing.

1175
00:40:04,140 --> 00:40:06,540
(Haha runs into someone.)

1176
00:40:06,970 --> 00:40:08,580
- What is it?
- So Min...

1177
00:40:09,220 --> 00:40:11,180
So Min thought she was a director.

1178
00:40:11,640 --> 00:40:12,680
What are you?

1179
00:40:13,310 --> 00:40:14,450
I am nothing.

1180
00:40:14,450 --> 00:40:16,020
You are just the owner
of a barbecue restaurant.

1181
00:40:16,260 --> 00:40:17,950
Don't try to fool me.

1182
00:40:17,950 --> 00:40:19,120
(Haha, Celebrity and owner
of a barbecue restaurant)

1183
00:40:19,120 --> 00:40:20,930
Avoid the others like me.

1184
00:40:21,600 --> 00:40:23,660
- You are Yang Se Hyeong's brother.
- That's right.

1185
00:40:24,720 --> 00:40:26,470
(Meanwhile,
Hyosung is searching for hints.)

1186
00:40:26,470 --> 00:40:27,540
Hold on.

1187
00:40:28,640 --> 00:40:31,970
(She finds the real hint.)

1188
00:40:34,200 --> 00:40:36,140
(Startled)

1189
00:40:36,140 --> 00:40:39,700
(The national actor
is a man in his 30s.)

1190
00:40:40,180 --> 00:40:41,680
(If we combine all the hints
on the national actor...)

1191
00:40:41,680 --> 00:40:42,770
(The national actor
doesn't have 9 in his age.)

1192
00:40:42,770 --> 00:40:44,080
(The national actor
is a man in his 30s...)

1193
00:40:44,080 --> 00:40:46,020
(who doesn't have 9 in his age.)

1194
00:40:46,020 --> 00:40:47,620
(Then the national actor
candidates are...)

1195
00:40:47,790 --> 00:40:50,180
(Se Chan and Kwang Soo.)

1196
00:40:50,180 --> 00:40:51,220
(They are also director candidates.)

1197
00:40:51,520 --> 00:40:53,290
Let's split. Go away.

1198
00:40:53,290 --> 00:40:54,660
I have nowhere to go.

1199
00:40:54,660 --> 00:40:55,760
I am nothing.

1200
00:40:55,760 --> 00:40:58,390
Do you want me to rip off
your name tag?

1201
00:40:58,930 --> 00:41:00,160
(Take this!)

1202
00:41:00,790 --> 00:41:03,660
(He ripped off Haha's name tag!)

1203
00:41:03,660 --> 00:41:06,060
(Se Chan eliminated Haha
in an instant.)

1204
00:41:06,060 --> 00:41:09,310
(Is Se Chan a director?)

1205
00:41:09,930 --> 00:41:11,770
This is a big hint.

1206
00:41:11,770 --> 00:41:12,810
(Is Kwang Soo a director?)

1207
00:41:12,810 --> 00:41:14,040
It will be over once I find him.

1208
00:41:14,040 --> 00:41:16,220
(If one is a director,
the other is the national actor.)

1209
00:41:16,870 --> 00:41:18,310
What was that?

1210
00:41:18,310 --> 00:41:20,310
(Is Se Chan a real director
who eliminated a fake director...)

1211
00:41:20,310 --> 00:41:21,720
(or the national actor
who thought Haha was a director?)

1212
00:41:21,950 --> 00:41:25,450
(Who is a director
and who is the national actor?)

1213
00:41:26,020 --> 00:41:30,600
Haha, an actor who
plays a director is out.

1214
00:41:31,370 --> 00:41:35,740
(Haha, an actor who
plays a director is out.)

1215
00:41:35,740 --> 00:41:37,910
(No way!)

1216
00:41:37,910 --> 00:41:39,010
(She gets goosebumps.)

1217
00:41:39,010 --> 00:41:40,160
I got goosebumps.

1218
00:41:40,160 --> 00:41:42,270
Who ripped off his name tag?

1219
00:41:43,310 --> 00:41:45,410
Did the national actor
think he was a director?

1220
00:41:45,410 --> 00:41:47,080
Did a director think...
Come this way.

1221
00:41:47,720 --> 00:41:49,910
Did a director think
Haha was the national actor?

1222
00:41:49,910 --> 00:41:51,410
(Is it the work of a director
or the national actor?)

1223
00:41:52,390 --> 00:41:53,680
This is bad.

1224
00:41:53,990 --> 00:41:57,390
(Both fake directors are out!)

1225
00:41:57,830 --> 00:41:59,790
(Once the national actor
gets eliminated,)

1226
00:41:59,790 --> 00:42:01,760
(Team Directors will win.)

1227
00:42:02,950 --> 00:42:04,290
That startled me.

1228
00:42:04,470 --> 00:42:07,770
(The two director and national actor
candidates meet.)

1229
00:42:07,770 --> 00:42:08,830
(One is the national actor
and the other is a director.)

1230
00:42:08,830 --> 00:42:10,370
- Did you find anything?
- No.

1231
00:42:12,100 --> 00:42:13,100
Where are you going?

1232
00:42:13,330 --> 00:42:14,640
I am going to look for hints.

1233
00:42:15,200 --> 00:42:17,080
(Staring)

1234
00:42:17,080 --> 00:42:18,140
What?

1235
00:42:18,140 --> 00:42:19,970
- Hold on.
- What?

1236
00:42:20,310 --> 00:42:22,470
Hold on. It seems like...

1237
00:42:22,470 --> 00:42:23,790
- you are trailing me.
- No.

1238
00:42:23,910 --> 00:42:24,910
You...

1239
00:42:24,910 --> 00:42:25,950
(He follows Se Chan.)

1240
00:42:25,950 --> 00:42:27,350
- What?
- You...

1241
00:42:27,520 --> 00:42:29,490
(Se Chan, you...)

1242
00:42:29,490 --> 00:42:30,830
You have two cameras on you.

1243
00:42:30,830 --> 00:42:34,120
(There are two cameras on him.)

1244
00:42:34,290 --> 00:42:36,620
- Kwang Soo, I moved up the ranks.
- Hold on.

1245
00:42:36,620 --> 00:42:38,930
A lot of people got eliminated.

1246
00:42:38,930 --> 00:42:41,990
This is the 1st time in 3 years
for you to have 2 cameras...

1247
00:42:41,990 --> 00:42:43,390
on you.

1248
00:42:43,390 --> 00:42:44,430
Listen.

1249
00:42:44,430 --> 00:42:46,410
A lot of people got eliminated.

1250
00:42:46,930 --> 00:42:48,180
They had a cameraman
who had nothing to shoot.

1251
00:42:48,180 --> 00:42:50,540
Is it for the online video channel
you run with Se Hyeong?

1252
00:42:50,540 --> 00:42:52,850
No, of course not.

1253
00:42:52,850 --> 00:42:55,310
No. We don't use
a professional camera.

1254
00:42:55,310 --> 00:42:56,450
We use a cellphone.

1255
00:42:56,450 --> 00:42:57,640
You used this camera for the video
of you eating pho, right?

1256
00:42:57,640 --> 00:42:59,580
No, I didn't.
It's a misunderstanding.

1257
00:42:59,580 --> 00:43:01,520
I should write this down.

1258
00:43:01,790 --> 00:43:03,450
- What are you writing down?
- "Se Chan has..."

1259
00:43:04,180 --> 00:43:05,260
"two cameras on him."

1260
00:43:05,260 --> 00:43:07,120
It's not like that.
It's a misunderstanding.

1261
00:43:07,120 --> 00:43:10,200
I have an extra camera on me
because many people got eliminated.

1262
00:43:11,220 --> 00:43:13,490
Hyosung, Haha is out.

1263
00:43:14,430 --> 00:43:15,870
What happened?

1264
00:43:15,870 --> 00:43:17,040
(Flustered)

1265
00:43:17,040 --> 00:43:18,660
This is so hard.

1266
00:43:19,640 --> 00:43:20,700
Now,

1267
00:43:21,010 --> 00:43:23,410
I need to find more hints.

1268
00:43:23,410 --> 00:43:25,700
(It seems like
she is doing a poor job of acting.)

1269
00:43:25,700 --> 00:43:27,370
- That was strange.
- What?

1270
00:43:28,140 --> 00:43:29,270
What?

1271
00:43:29,270 --> 00:43:31,180
- Hyosung, that was so strange.
- Was it sloppy?

1272
00:43:31,180 --> 00:43:34,020
Without moving your feet, you said,
"I need to find more hints."

1273
00:43:34,060 --> 00:43:35,950
Hyosung, that was so strange.

1274
00:43:36,350 --> 00:43:39,020
I am just beginning
to figure things out.

1275
00:43:39,260 --> 00:43:40,600
I need to hurry up.

1276
00:43:40,600 --> 00:43:42,950
You aren't the national actor,
are you?

1277
00:43:43,060 --> 00:43:44,290
No, I am not.

1278
00:43:45,390 --> 00:43:47,770
Why do you keep looking
for the national actor?

1279
00:43:47,770 --> 00:43:49,930
(She seems even more suspicious.)

1280
00:43:49,930 --> 00:43:52,370
I need to find the national actor
and protect him.

1281
00:43:52,370 --> 00:43:53,410
(The national actor
is an important figure.)

1282
00:43:53,410 --> 00:43:55,810
(Hyosung is suspicious.)

1283
00:43:56,580 --> 00:43:57,810
Something doesn't seem right.

1284
00:43:57,810 --> 00:44:00,910
(Could Hyosung be a director?)

1285
00:44:02,240 --> 00:44:03,310
(At that moment,)

1286
00:44:03,310 --> 00:44:04,390
Hey.

1287
00:44:04,390 --> 00:44:06,310
(someone shows up.)

1288
00:44:06,310 --> 00:44:07,790
(Jae Suk is happy
to see this person.)

1289
00:44:09,160 --> 00:44:10,220
Hey.

1290
00:44:10,220 --> 00:44:11,990
(Both of them greet
this mysterious person.)

1291
00:44:11,990 --> 00:44:13,990
- Hold on.
- What is going on?

1292
00:44:13,990 --> 00:44:15,620
- What...
- What is going on?

1293
00:44:15,950 --> 00:44:16,990
What is going on?

1294
00:44:16,990 --> 00:44:20,100
(Hyosung joins him.)

1295
00:44:20,540 --> 00:44:23,740
(A 2-on-1 fight suddenly occurs.)

1296
00:44:23,740 --> 00:44:25,060
(Ripping)

1297
00:44:25,560 --> 00:44:27,870
Good job.

1298
00:44:27,870 --> 00:44:29,100
You jerks!

1299
00:44:29,680 --> 00:44:31,200
(Who could be
the mysterious shadow?)

1300
00:44:31,200 --> 00:44:33,600
You jerks! You jerks!

1301
00:44:33,600 --> 00:44:36,020
(Hyosung worked with this person
to eliminate Jae Suk.)

1302
00:44:36,020 --> 00:44:37,020
(What could be her identity?)

1303
00:44:37,020 --> 00:44:40,390
You are the directors who
hold a grudge against the actors...

1304
00:44:40,390 --> 00:44:42,290
for repeatedly turning down
your childish scripts.

1305
00:44:42,790 --> 00:44:44,120
Directors.

1306
00:44:44,260 --> 00:44:46,660
Eliminate the national actor
before the race ends...

1307
00:44:46,660 --> 00:44:49,660
or keep your identities hidden
until the end in order to win.

1308
00:44:49,660 --> 00:44:50,990
The two of you must wait...

1309
00:44:50,990 --> 00:44:53,270
until the fake directors
get eliminated...

1310
00:44:53,270 --> 00:44:55,890
in order to eliminate
the national actor.

1311
00:44:55,890 --> 00:44:57,810
If you eliminate
three actors by mistake,

1312
00:44:57,810 --> 00:45:00,040
you will lose and the race will end.

1313
00:45:00,830 --> 00:45:03,370
(Hyosung, a director, was looking
for the national actor.)

1314
00:45:03,370 --> 00:45:05,100
The national actor.

1315
00:45:05,910 --> 00:45:08,950
(I need to find the national actor.)

1316
00:45:09,120 --> 00:45:11,990
- Actor Jae Suk is out.
- What?

1317
00:45:12,450 --> 00:45:14,680
The race will end in 10 minutes.

1318
00:45:15,580 --> 00:45:16,790
We have 10 minutes.

1319
00:45:16,790 --> 00:45:18,450
We need to find something...

1320
00:45:18,790 --> 00:45:20,620
for the second trial.

1321
00:45:20,620 --> 00:45:24,970
(The members aren't certain about
the 2 directors and national actor.)

1322
00:45:24,970 --> 00:45:26,200
(The two directors must eliminate
the national actor...)

1323
00:45:26,200 --> 00:45:27,370
We don't have much time.

1324
00:45:27,370 --> 00:45:29,140
(and the national actor
must eliminate the 2 directors.)

1325
00:45:29,140 --> 00:45:31,010
Jong Kook. Jong Kook.

1326
00:45:31,430 --> 00:45:32,540
- What?
- Here.

1327
00:45:33,010 --> 00:45:34,870
Let's talk for five minutes.

1328
00:45:35,270 --> 00:45:36,510
- What?
- You can't rip off his name tag.

1329
00:45:36,510 --> 00:45:38,370
- I am not scared.
- Jong Kook, are you scared?

1330
00:45:38,370 --> 00:45:40,680
- Then you don't have to come.
- What? I am not scared.

1331
00:45:40,680 --> 00:45:42,620
- Then come.
- Sure.

1332
00:45:42,740 --> 00:45:43,910
Fine.

1333
00:45:44,140 --> 00:45:46,020
You may not believe me,

1334
00:45:46,810 --> 00:45:47,810
but I am...

1335
00:45:49,020 --> 00:45:51,260
- the national actor.
- Okay.

1336
00:45:51,260 --> 00:45:54,600
I thought you would make a move.

1337
00:45:54,600 --> 00:45:57,260
It's the right time for it.

1338
00:45:57,260 --> 00:45:58,330
Listen.

1339
00:45:58,330 --> 00:45:59,870
- People who are cornered do it.
- I will give you...

1340
00:46:00,390 --> 00:46:03,270
a reason to trust me.
Hyosung told you earlier...

1341
00:46:03,390 --> 00:46:05,410
that Director B is a woman, right?

1342
00:46:05,930 --> 00:46:09,810
(Is Director B a woman?)

1343
00:46:10,870 --> 00:46:14,950
(Jong Kook heard from Hyosung
that Director B is a woman.)

1344
00:46:14,950 --> 00:46:19,850
(The crucial hint
Se Chan claimed to have found)

1345
00:46:19,850 --> 00:46:23,890
(Se Chan's claim)

1346
00:46:23,890 --> 00:46:26,220
(He says Hyosung is Director B
since she is a female guest.)

1347
00:46:26,220 --> 00:46:28,450
Here is the deal.

1348
00:46:28,450 --> 00:46:29,790
If I rip off Hyosung's name tag...

1349
00:46:29,790 --> 00:46:31,930
and she turns out to be Director B,

1350
00:46:31,930 --> 00:46:33,660
please believe me.

1351
00:46:34,100 --> 00:46:36,270
I won't play any tricks.

1352
00:46:36,430 --> 00:46:37,700
- Let's go.
- Okay.

1353
00:46:37,700 --> 00:46:39,160
- Let's cast the die.
- Come on.

1354
00:46:39,160 --> 00:46:41,100
- What a coincidence!
- Jong Kook.

1355
00:46:41,870 --> 00:46:44,370
(Hyosung appears
as soon as they finished talking.)

1356
00:46:44,370 --> 00:46:45,680
Who is it? Oh, here she comes.

1357
00:46:45,680 --> 00:46:47,410
(Isn't the timing too uncanny?)

1358
00:46:47,410 --> 00:46:49,240
- Hold on. Hold on.
- Can you help me?

1359
00:46:49,470 --> 00:46:51,950
Can you hold her for me?

1360
00:46:52,310 --> 00:46:55,390
- The two of them could turn on me.
- It's not like that, Jong Kook.

1361
00:46:55,390 --> 00:46:57,290
- When I grab Hyosung,
- Please.

1362
00:46:57,290 --> 00:46:59,390
you could suddenly rip off
my name tag.

1363
00:46:59,680 --> 00:47:01,200
I can see that happening.

1364
00:47:01,290 --> 00:47:02,890
Who is a director?

1365
00:47:03,490 --> 00:47:04,660
Come here.

1366
00:47:04,660 --> 00:47:05,720
What are you?

1367
00:47:05,970 --> 00:47:07,020
I am an actor.

1368
00:47:07,020 --> 00:47:08,290
(She feigns innocence.)

1369
00:47:08,290 --> 00:47:10,040
(Jong Kook watches.)

1370
00:47:10,470 --> 00:47:13,240
- This is driving me crazy.
- We need to survive from them.

1371
00:47:13,240 --> 00:47:15,010
- What are you?
- I am an actor.

1372
00:47:15,010 --> 00:47:18,040
- You are a director.
- I am an actor.

1373
00:47:18,040 --> 00:47:19,310
You are a director.

1374
00:47:19,310 --> 00:47:20,950
- Are we repeating the same words?
- Yes.

1375
00:47:21,180 --> 00:47:23,350
- I am an actor.
- Hyosung.

1376
00:47:23,970 --> 00:47:27,720
(Se Chan attacks Hyosung.)

1377
00:47:28,390 --> 00:47:30,310
(Jong Kook still doesn't move.)

1378
00:47:31,180 --> 00:47:34,450
(Se Chan tries to prove
that he is the national actor.)

1379
00:47:34,620 --> 00:47:37,020
What is going on?

1380
00:47:37,020 --> 00:47:38,930
(Ripping)

1381
00:47:39,370 --> 00:47:40,770
Are you the national actor?

1382
00:47:40,770 --> 00:47:42,560
(Are you the national actor?)

1383
00:47:42,560 --> 00:47:43,930
(It's time to check
Hyosung's identity.)

1384
00:47:43,930 --> 00:47:44,930
Let's see it.

1385
00:47:45,330 --> 00:47:46,810
- Let's see it.
- Jong Kook.

1386
00:47:46,870 --> 00:47:48,600
Jong Kook, trust me this once.

1387
00:47:49,330 --> 00:47:50,970
(Hyosung is...)

1388
00:47:50,970 --> 00:47:53,700
(one of the directors.)

1389
00:47:53,700 --> 00:47:56,120
(Does that mean
Se Chan is the national actor?)

1390
00:47:56,120 --> 00:47:57,240
You trust me now, right?

1391
00:47:57,620 --> 00:47:59,220
Her tone...

1392
00:47:59,240 --> 00:48:00,580
Hold on. Is he acting?

1393
00:48:00,580 --> 00:48:01,790
For goodness' sake.

1394
00:48:01,790 --> 00:48:02,790
(Hold on. Is he acting?)

1395
00:48:02,790 --> 00:48:05,450
(He can only laugh.)

1396
00:48:05,680 --> 00:48:06,930
"Are you the national actor?"

1397
00:48:06,930 --> 00:48:09,020
Maybe the two of you planned this.

1398
00:48:09,290 --> 00:48:11,620
- Hold on.
- Jong Kook, I am going insane.

1399
00:48:11,620 --> 00:48:13,270
She came out of nowhere.

1400
00:48:13,270 --> 00:48:14,790
After her name tag got ripped off,
she said,

1401
00:48:14,970 --> 00:48:17,140
"Are you the national actor?"

1402
00:48:18,270 --> 00:48:19,270
Hold on.

1403
00:48:19,270 --> 00:48:21,640
Jong Kook,
don't let Hyosung fool you.

1404
00:48:21,640 --> 00:48:22,770
All right.

1405
00:48:22,770 --> 00:48:23,770
(Se Chan eliminated Hyosung
before Jong Kook's eyes.)

1406
00:48:23,770 --> 00:48:26,680
All right. You should go over there.

1407
00:48:26,850 --> 00:48:28,850
Even when I show you proof,

1408
00:48:28,850 --> 00:48:30,080
you think I am acting.

1409
00:48:30,080 --> 00:48:31,080
(The members are still unsure
about everyone's identity.)

1410
00:48:31,080 --> 00:48:33,020
The second trial will begin.

1411
00:48:33,640 --> 00:48:35,160
This is getting interesting.

1412
00:48:35,680 --> 00:48:36,890
(Both of them are the candidates...)

1413
00:48:36,890 --> 00:48:38,490
I have no idea.

1414
00:48:38,490 --> 00:48:39,580
(for a director
and the national actor.)

1415
00:48:39,580 --> 00:48:41,160
- Yes?
- Kwang Soo.

1416
00:48:41,160 --> 00:48:42,220
Yes?

1417
00:48:42,220 --> 00:48:43,890
Did you find anything out?

1418
00:48:43,890 --> 00:48:45,330
I found out many things.

1419
00:48:45,890 --> 00:48:49,740
Just now, I watched...

1420
00:48:51,370 --> 00:48:54,200
a very nicely-planned sketch.

1421
00:48:54,200 --> 00:48:55,910
(It wasn't a sketch.)

1422
00:48:57,010 --> 00:48:59,870
(You are a director.)

1423
00:48:59,870 --> 00:49:01,450
(What he showed is believed
to be part of a sketch.)

1424
00:49:01,450 --> 00:49:02,810
Sit down.

1425
00:49:03,410 --> 00:49:05,810
The second trial will begin now.

1426
00:49:05,810 --> 00:49:08,350
Hyosung, who was a real director,
is out.

1427
00:49:08,520 --> 00:49:10,260
Ji Hyo.

1428
00:49:10,680 --> 00:49:12,580
This is making me talkative.

1429
00:49:12,580 --> 00:49:13,720
Listen to me.

1430
00:49:13,720 --> 00:49:15,830
I am the one
who eliminated Hyosung.

1431
00:49:15,850 --> 00:49:17,060
How did you know?

1432
00:49:17,060 --> 00:49:18,200
I found a hint.

1433
00:49:18,870 --> 00:49:20,830
"Director B is a guest."

1434
00:49:20,830 --> 00:49:25,410
- Did someone see the hint with you?
- Only I saw it.

1435
00:49:25,410 --> 00:49:26,430
(Only I saw it.)

1436
00:49:26,430 --> 00:49:28,580
That's not how you scam people.

1437
00:49:28,580 --> 00:49:31,180
(He suddenly criticizes
Se Chan's scamming skills.)

1438
00:49:31,180 --> 00:49:33,640
(The senior member of Running Man
criticizes Se Chan.)

1439
00:49:33,640 --> 00:49:35,620
I get that you are desperate,

1440
00:49:35,620 --> 00:49:37,020
but that's not how you scam people.

1441
00:49:37,020 --> 00:49:38,740
Jong Kook, tell everyone.

1442
00:49:38,740 --> 00:49:41,260
Since you didn't believe my words...

1443
00:49:41,260 --> 00:49:43,220
I will recount what I saw.

1444
00:49:43,390 --> 00:49:44,990
Listen to me.

1445
00:49:44,990 --> 00:49:47,390
Se Chan claimed
that he was the national actor...

1446
00:49:47,720 --> 00:49:50,450
and asked whether I would trust him
if he eliminated Hyosung...

1447
00:49:50,720 --> 00:49:51,970
before my eyes.

1448
00:49:53,160 --> 00:49:56,490
I said that he was scheming,

1449
00:49:56,490 --> 00:49:57,600
but Se Chan begged me to trust him.

1450
00:49:57,600 --> 00:50:00,370
Then out of the blue,

1451
00:50:00,660 --> 00:50:03,370
Hyosung walked towards us.

1452
00:50:03,370 --> 00:50:05,200
This is driving me crazy.

1453
00:50:05,580 --> 00:50:07,850
- What timing!
- This is driving me crazy.

1454
00:50:07,850 --> 00:50:10,350
Then the two of them
started talking.

1455
00:50:10,990 --> 00:50:12,910
They didn't know the script
very well.

1456
00:50:13,950 --> 00:50:15,850
So they didn't make much sense.

1457
00:50:16,080 --> 00:50:17,520
You thought that was scripted?

1458
00:50:17,520 --> 00:50:18,620
All of a sudden...

1459
00:50:18,620 --> 00:50:20,580
I questioned her one last time.

1460
00:50:20,580 --> 00:50:22,600
- I tested her.
- Then all of a sudden,

1461
00:50:22,600 --> 00:50:24,220
he ripped Hyosung's name tag,

1462
00:50:24,330 --> 00:50:26,720
but as soon as he ripped it,

1463
00:50:27,020 --> 00:50:29,140
she was like,
"What? Are you the national actor?"

1464
00:50:29,140 --> 00:50:30,640
Hey!

1465
00:50:30,640 --> 00:50:33,740
(That was bad acting.)

1466
00:50:33,740 --> 00:50:37,430
(Hyosung's awkward acting
convinced Jong Kook.)

1467
00:50:38,450 --> 00:50:41,850
Jong Kook, if you do this,
you'll hurt many actors.

1468
00:50:41,850 --> 00:50:44,350
No, listen to this. Goodness.

1469
00:50:44,350 --> 00:50:47,410
I watched...

1470
00:50:47,490 --> 00:50:50,850
a very awkward play.

1471
00:50:50,850 --> 00:50:51,850
Not even.

1472
00:50:51,850 --> 00:50:54,560
What if Hyosung wasn't acting?

1473
00:50:54,560 --> 00:50:56,560
She could just be awkward in life.

1474
00:50:56,560 --> 00:50:57,970
"Are you the national actor?"...

1475
00:50:57,970 --> 00:50:59,990
was because she knew
who the director was.

1476
00:51:00,220 --> 00:51:01,990
I have a question.

1477
00:51:02,830 --> 00:51:04,160
You knew...

1478
00:51:04,540 --> 00:51:07,870
Director A is a Running Man member.

1479
00:51:08,430 --> 00:51:09,470
- I know.
- Why didn't you say anything?

1480
00:51:09,470 --> 00:51:12,600
Then why didn't you rip Se Chan's
name tag? From the beginning?

1481
00:51:12,600 --> 00:51:15,640
You told me
that was the first hint you saw.

1482
00:51:15,640 --> 00:51:17,220
Did he say that last?

1483
00:51:17,740 --> 00:51:19,580
Because we deduced that...

1484
00:51:19,580 --> 00:51:22,220
(Because we deduced that...)

1485
00:51:22,220 --> 00:51:24,560
Anyway, when I heard...

1486
00:51:24,560 --> 00:51:25,760
(Kwang Soo can't answer properly.)

1487
00:51:25,760 --> 00:51:27,930
- when I heard...
- "Anyway?"

1488
00:51:27,930 --> 00:51:29,930
(Something's strange.)

1489
00:51:29,930 --> 00:51:32,370
it's somebody in their 30s,

1490
00:51:32,490 --> 00:51:35,140
I know it's not me so that's when
I started looking for Se Chan.

1491
00:51:35,140 --> 00:51:37,100
I don't get it.

1492
00:51:37,240 --> 00:51:40,060
Four of you,
please make your decision.

1493
00:51:40,060 --> 00:51:41,080
Okay.

1494
00:51:42,080 --> 00:51:43,430
Please say it in three.

1495
00:51:43,430 --> 00:51:44,580
- Gosh.
- One,

1496
00:51:45,370 --> 00:51:46,700
(4 actors will choose a director
by majority vote.)

1497
00:51:46,700 --> 00:51:47,720
two,

1498
00:51:48,540 --> 00:51:50,310
(Who do the actors think
a director is?)

1499
00:51:50,310 --> 00:51:52,520
- three.
- Yang Se Chan.

1500
00:51:52,520 --> 00:51:53,810
(Se Chan is their suspect.)

1501
00:51:53,810 --> 00:51:55,180
Yang Se Chan. I don't know.

1502
00:51:56,410 --> 00:51:59,620
It's strange
how he went and came back.

1503
00:51:59,620 --> 00:52:01,560
I know. He kept on leaving.

1504
00:52:01,560 --> 00:52:04,290
Jong Kook, rip my name tag.
I want to see your face.

1505
00:52:04,490 --> 00:52:05,830
Me? All right.

1506
00:52:05,830 --> 00:52:07,370
- Yes.
- I'll do it.

1507
00:52:07,470 --> 00:52:09,870
I opened up about everything.

1508
00:52:09,870 --> 00:52:12,660
- I...
- Okay.

1509
00:52:12,700 --> 00:52:15,100
Look at my face
then look at Kwang Soo's face.

1510
00:52:15,100 --> 00:52:17,100
- I'm going to look at you.
- Okay.

1511
00:52:17,100 --> 00:52:18,640
Fine. Okay.

1512
00:52:18,640 --> 00:52:19,970
- One,
- Let's see.

1513
00:52:20,040 --> 00:52:22,120
(If Se Chan is a director,
Team Actors win.)

1514
00:52:22,120 --> 00:52:23,270
two,

1515
00:52:24,120 --> 00:52:25,390
(What is Se Chan's identity?)

1516
00:52:25,390 --> 00:52:26,390
three.

1517
00:53:40,080 --> 00:53:42,120
(If Se Chan is a director,
Team Actors win.)

1518
00:53:42,120 --> 00:53:44,190
(If he's a national actor,
Team Directors win.)

1519
00:53:44,190 --> 00:53:46,750
(What is Se Chan's identity?)

1520
00:53:46,980 --> 00:53:51,250
(National actor)

1521
00:53:53,420 --> 00:53:56,690
(Se Chan was a national actor!)

1522
00:53:58,730 --> 00:54:00,230
Hello.

1523
00:54:00,230 --> 00:54:01,290
(Before the start of the show)

1524
00:54:01,290 --> 00:54:05,230
What kind of informer role
do you need from me?

1525
00:54:05,440 --> 00:54:06,980
- What am I today?
- You are...

1526
00:54:06,980 --> 00:54:09,630
a national actor every Korean loves.

1527
00:54:09,630 --> 00:54:10,900
(You are a national actor
every Korean loves.)

1528
00:54:10,900 --> 00:54:12,750
Are you lying already?

1529
00:54:12,750 --> 00:54:15,080
Okay.

1530
00:54:15,710 --> 00:54:17,380
(I witnessed it!)

1531
00:54:18,480 --> 00:54:20,310
(Haha and Tae Oh were together,)

1532
00:54:20,310 --> 00:54:21,920
(but Tae Oh was eliminated.)

1533
00:54:22,380 --> 00:54:25,460
(Se Chan heard
Jae Suk's statement.)

1534
00:54:27,630 --> 00:54:29,420
(Haha is a director.)

1535
00:54:30,600 --> 00:54:33,690
(Se Chan was certain Haha was
a director and eliminated him.)

1536
00:54:33,690 --> 00:54:36,690
(He was the national actor
who was looking for the directors.)

1537
00:54:39,440 --> 00:54:41,330
(At that moment!)

1538
00:54:42,170 --> 00:54:44,310
(Yes!)

1539
00:54:44,900 --> 00:54:47,080
(Is he the remaining director?)

1540
00:54:47,210 --> 00:54:50,190
National Actor Yang Se Chan
has been eliminated.

1541
00:54:50,480 --> 00:54:51,810
- Really?
- Yes!

1542
00:54:51,810 --> 00:54:53,620
(The remaining director
was Kwang Soo!)

1543
00:54:55,020 --> 00:54:57,250
(I think it's Suk Jin.)

1544
00:54:57,250 --> 00:54:58,630
(The fake director)

1545
00:54:59,580 --> 00:55:04,100
(He eliminated Suk Jin,
but he was an actor.)

1546
00:55:04,900 --> 00:55:06,230
You idiot.

1547
00:55:06,560 --> 00:55:10,730
(An actor who plays a director,
Haha, is out.)

1548
00:55:10,730 --> 00:55:11,730
How did that happen?

1549
00:55:11,730 --> 00:55:15,000
(Actor Haha was out, so he could
eliminate the national actor now.)

1550
00:55:16,630 --> 00:55:23,250
(He eliminated Jae Suk who was
closing in on him.)

1551
00:55:24,940 --> 00:55:28,080
The winning team of Ggannes
Film Festival: The Uninvited One...

1552
00:55:28,080 --> 00:55:29,350
is Team Directors.

1553
00:55:29,350 --> 00:55:31,250
(Winners of Ggannes Film Festival:
The Uninvited One: Team Directors)

1554
00:55:31,520 --> 00:55:33,960
I was a director all day today.

1555
00:55:34,400 --> 00:55:36,100
Team Actors lost the race.

1556
00:55:36,100 --> 00:55:38,730
Since there are only
two water cannons,

1557
00:55:38,730 --> 00:55:41,330
National Actor Se Chan
has to take one.

1558
00:55:41,330 --> 00:55:44,400
You can choose another person
to join you.

1559
00:55:44,400 --> 00:55:47,380
It was my mistake, so I'll go.
Let's go together.

1560
00:55:47,440 --> 00:55:49,810
(He feels pressured.)

1561
00:55:49,810 --> 00:55:51,650
- Hold on.
- He feels bad.

1562
00:55:51,980 --> 00:55:54,350
For Jong Kook, the timing was...

1563
00:55:54,350 --> 00:55:56,520
- It was my fault.
- perfect.

1564
00:55:56,520 --> 00:56:00,210
The person who will stand under
the water cannon with me...

1565
00:56:00,710 --> 00:56:03,020
(He chooses the person who'll
receive the penalty with him.)

1566
00:56:03,020 --> 00:56:04,190
is Kyung-hwan.

1567
00:56:04,190 --> 00:56:05,420
(It's Kyung-hwan.)

1568
00:56:05,420 --> 00:56:07,060
Are you crazy? What was that for?

1569
00:56:07,690 --> 00:56:08,690
What?

1570
00:56:09,150 --> 00:56:10,460
What was that for?

1571
00:56:10,460 --> 00:56:12,900
Kyung-hwan,
you need the camera on you.

1572
00:56:12,900 --> 00:56:14,690
So you were nothing today,
but you acted that way?

1573
00:56:14,690 --> 00:56:17,040
I know! You deserve
the water cannon.

1574
00:56:17,600 --> 00:56:18,730
This is nuts.

1575
00:56:19,730 --> 00:56:22,730
Why is Kyung-hwan standing there?

1576
00:56:22,730 --> 00:56:24,000
(He's getting ready
for the water cannon.)

1577
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:25,440
Kyung-hwan.

1578
00:56:25,810 --> 00:56:29,620
You showed your presence
in unique ways today.

1579
00:56:29,620 --> 00:56:31,080
We never had a guest like him.

1580
00:56:31,080 --> 00:56:35,380
Unfortunately, I joined late,
so I wasn't too funny.

1581
00:56:35,620 --> 00:56:37,750
As a penalty,

1582
00:56:37,750 --> 00:56:39,480
- That's not true.
- I get the water bucket.

1583
00:56:39,480 --> 00:56:41,000
- That's why he's here.
- Then...

1584
00:56:41,000 --> 00:56:42,130
Let's go!

1585
00:56:43,920 --> 00:56:48,040
(Pouring)

1586
00:56:48,040 --> 00:56:49,190
That's cold.

1587
00:56:49,330 --> 00:56:51,270
(That was a good one.)

1588
00:56:52,170 --> 00:56:54,310
(We would like to thank Kyung-hwan,
Hyosung, Tae Oh, and Yoyomi.)

1589
00:56:54,310 --> 00:56:58,270
- That was cold water.
- It's cold.

1590
00:56:58,270 --> 00:56:59,710
(That was a refreshing penalty
in the frigid winter.)

1591
00:57:00,670 --> 00:57:03,920
(Day in Yeouido when cold weather
warning was in effect)

1592
00:57:03,920 --> 00:57:06,520
It finally feels like winter.

1593
00:57:06,520 --> 00:57:08,750
We'll start separately today.

1594
00:57:08,750 --> 00:57:10,330
- Are we starting?
- Yes.

1595
00:57:10,750 --> 00:57:13,130
All eight members will
start separately.

1596
00:57:13,130 --> 00:57:14,500
This is the mission.

1597
00:57:14,500 --> 00:57:15,630
(All 8 members started
at different locations.)

1598
00:57:16,330 --> 00:57:18,630
"Form a team
and come to the opening location."

1599
00:57:18,630 --> 00:57:21,370
"4 guests today..."
There are 4 guests?

1600
00:57:21,370 --> 00:57:23,630
"Four guests today are captains."

1601
00:57:23,630 --> 00:57:26,500
"They'll recruit two people
from Running Man."

1602
00:57:26,500 --> 00:57:30,500
"Once you form a team of three,
you will obtain the address."

1603
00:57:30,500 --> 00:57:32,850
"The first 2 teams will
receive benefits." Oh, my.

1604
00:57:32,850 --> 00:57:34,250
(Form a team of 3 to obtain
the address. 2 teams get benefits.)

1605
00:57:34,250 --> 00:57:35,540
So we don't know
who the captains are?

1606
00:57:35,540 --> 00:57:38,120
Who's the other member besides me?

1607
00:57:38,120 --> 00:57:39,120
Do you not tell us that either?

1608
00:57:39,120 --> 00:57:41,620
Who are the guests? Goodness.

1609
00:57:43,120 --> 00:57:44,190
Am I the only one who's cold?

1610
00:57:44,190 --> 00:57:47,000
It's so cold. This is no joke.
It's freezing.

1611
00:57:47,750 --> 00:57:50,500
(Born to be actor, Ahn Jae Hong)

1612
00:57:51,600 --> 00:57:54,440
(The lovable actress, Kang Sora,
Rising-star actress, Jeon Yeo Been)

1613
00:57:55,190 --> 00:57:57,460
(Kim Sung Oh, an actor
with a distinctive character)

1614
00:57:57,770 --> 00:57:59,060
(Casts of "Secret Zoo"...)

1615
00:57:59,060 --> 00:58:00,980
(are on Running Man!)

1616
00:58:02,080 --> 00:58:06,270
(Ahn Jae Hong captured
the movie scene with his warmth.)

1617
00:58:07,250 --> 00:58:11,440
(Kang Sora always shows
new charms.)

1618
00:58:12,120 --> 00:58:15,520
(Kim Sung Oh's face and acting are
always memorable.)

1619
00:58:16,290 --> 00:58:19,460
(Jeon Yeo Been has a bright future
with her characteristic acting.)

1620
00:58:20,600 --> 00:58:23,330
Welcome to Running Man.

1621
00:58:23,400 --> 00:58:25,870
We invited you separately
before the opening segment...

1622
00:58:25,870 --> 00:58:29,290
because of a special mission
since this is your first time.

1623
00:58:29,290 --> 00:58:32,500
Sung Oh, Jae Hong,
Sora, and Yeo Been,

1624
00:58:32,500 --> 00:58:34,900
you are captains of each team.

1625
00:58:34,900 --> 00:58:36,600
(We're captains?)

1626
00:58:36,600 --> 00:58:40,850
You need to pick two people
from the Running Man cast,

1627
00:58:40,850 --> 00:58:44,120
pick them up,
and get to the opening location.

1628
00:58:44,120 --> 00:58:45,480
Pick them up?

1629
00:58:46,480 --> 00:58:49,790
Please pick two members each.

1630
00:58:50,020 --> 00:58:51,380
- Let's go.
- Is it a lottery?

1631
00:58:51,380 --> 00:58:53,130
- Do we pick 2 each?
- Yes, 2 each.

1632
00:58:54,000 --> 00:58:55,750
Pick two.

1633
00:58:56,190 --> 00:58:57,920
I'm getting nervous for some reason.

1634
00:58:59,170 --> 00:59:01,960
(They carefully check
who their teammates are.)

1635
00:59:01,960 --> 00:59:02,960
Why?

1636
00:59:02,960 --> 00:59:05,400
I picked somebody reliable.

1637
00:59:05,830 --> 00:59:09,100
(Sung Oh's first pick is Jong Kook!)

1638
00:59:10,400 --> 00:59:12,400
(The four teams)

1639
00:59:12,400 --> 00:59:14,540
Let's start the race now.

1640
00:59:14,540 --> 00:59:16,210
(They pick their teams
and start the mission.)

1641
00:59:16,920 --> 00:59:19,980
Please give me Ji Hyo's number.

1642
00:59:19,980 --> 00:59:21,560
- What?
- Please give me Ji Hyo's number.

1643
00:59:21,560 --> 00:59:23,520
- Who do you need to find?
- Ji Hyo.

1644
00:59:23,520 --> 00:59:24,630
- Do you have her number?
- She's here.

1645
00:59:24,630 --> 00:59:27,400
But I don't know where she is.

1646
00:59:27,400 --> 00:59:29,460
- Her car's white.
- Really?

1647
00:59:29,460 --> 00:59:30,900
All these cars are white.

1648
00:59:30,900 --> 00:59:32,600
Go to the parking lot.

1649
00:59:32,600 --> 00:59:35,000
Really? Okay.

1650
00:59:35,100 --> 00:59:38,040
Se Chan.

1651
00:59:39,400 --> 00:59:41,770
Let me call So Min.

1652
00:59:41,770 --> 00:59:43,210
(He shot a commercial with her.)

1653
00:59:47,000 --> 00:59:49,620
What? It's Jae Hong.

1654
00:59:49,620 --> 00:59:53,040
Jae Hong is calling me. Jae Hong.

1655
00:59:53,420 --> 00:59:56,250
(Why is she so happy it's Jae Hong?)

1656
00:59:56,880 --> 00:59:58,190
Date for a day.

1657
00:59:58,190 --> 01:00:01,790
(Jae Hong is...)

1658
01:00:01,790 --> 01:00:03,790
(her ideal type.)

1659
01:00:04,130 --> 01:00:06,900
(Her ideal type is
finally on Running Man!)

1660
01:00:08,100 --> 01:00:11,270
(She is excited
to receive a call from him.)

1661
01:00:11,440 --> 01:00:13,060
- Hello.
- Hello.

1662
01:00:14,380 --> 01:00:15,900
Are you visiting the show today?

1663
01:00:15,900 --> 01:00:16,980
(She uses her cute tone.)

1664
01:00:16,980 --> 01:00:18,000
Hello, So Min.

1665
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:19,170
(Hello, So Min.)

1666
01:00:19,170 --> 01:00:21,440
What is going on?
Are you coming? Are you a guest?

1667
01:00:21,940 --> 01:00:22,980
Yes.

1668
01:00:23,080 --> 01:00:24,480
My goodness.

1669
01:00:25,210 --> 01:00:27,560
Are you on my team?

1670
01:00:27,880 --> 01:00:29,980
Yes. Where are you? We need to meet.

1671
01:00:30,560 --> 01:00:32,290
I am at the Han River parking lot.

1672
01:00:32,290 --> 01:00:34,150
Who else is on our team?

1673
01:00:34,400 --> 01:00:36,520
Yang Se Chan.

1674
01:00:37,520 --> 01:00:38,730
(He tries to get
Se Chan's phone number.)

1675
01:00:38,730 --> 01:00:40,420
Are you near Yeouido Park?
It's not far from here.

1676
01:00:40,900 --> 01:00:42,870
- I will give you his number.
- Okay.

1677
01:00:43,060 --> 01:00:44,540
I will text you.

1678
01:00:45,460 --> 01:00:47,830
(He adapted to Running Man
as soon as he arrived.)

1679
01:00:47,830 --> 01:00:49,310
Hello.

1680
01:00:49,940 --> 01:00:51,100
Who is this?

1681
01:00:51,210 --> 01:00:52,940
Hello, Se Chan.

1682
01:00:52,940 --> 01:00:54,380
I am Ahn Jae Hong.

1683
01:00:55,880 --> 01:00:57,080
Stop lying. Who are you?

1684
01:00:58,480 --> 01:01:00,040
I am not lying.

1685
01:01:00,620 --> 01:01:02,750
- Is it really you?
- Yes, it is.

1686
01:01:02,750 --> 01:01:04,290
My goodness, hello.

1687
01:01:04,290 --> 01:01:05,730
Hello. Have you been well?

1688
01:01:05,750 --> 01:01:07,690
You and I are on the same team.
You are cold, right?

1689
01:01:07,750 --> 01:01:10,290
You don't sound like
you are in a hurry.

1690
01:01:10,560 --> 01:01:12,020
It's as if you aren't
a fellow team member.

1691
01:01:12,560 --> 01:01:14,460
(Distrust is prevalent
on this show.)

1692
01:01:14,460 --> 01:01:16,000
- You should be in a hurry.
- I am remaining calm...

1693
01:01:16,400 --> 01:01:18,000
in order to be dependable.

1694
01:01:18,210 --> 01:01:20,040
I will put my trust in you
and wait here.

1695
01:01:20,670 --> 01:01:22,600
Okay. Don't tell So Min.

1696
01:01:22,600 --> 01:01:24,380
We are on the same team, Se Chan.

1697
01:01:24,400 --> 01:01:26,350
- You have to trust me.
- I trust you.

1698
01:01:27,520 --> 01:01:28,940
(Sora got Kwang Soo's number
from a friend.)

1699
01:01:28,940 --> 01:01:30,170
Hello.

1700
01:01:30,810 --> 01:01:33,290
- My name is Kang Sora.
- What?

1701
01:01:33,290 --> 01:01:36,290
I became a captain.

1702
01:01:37,380 --> 01:01:40,190
- Where are you?
- You are Kang Sora.

1703
01:01:40,290 --> 01:01:42,190
I need to go to you.

1704
01:01:43,100 --> 01:01:44,920
I am at Exit Five
of Yeouido Park Station.

1705
01:01:44,920 --> 01:01:46,330
Exit Five of Yeouido Park Station?

1706
01:01:46,330 --> 01:01:48,370
Whether you are the captain or not,
I will get on the van.

1707
01:01:48,460 --> 01:01:49,900
Okay.

1708
01:01:50,460 --> 01:01:53,000
- If this is a lie,
- Okay.

1709
01:01:53,000 --> 01:01:54,730
I will be brokenhearted.

1710
01:01:54,730 --> 01:01:56,500
It's real.

1711
01:01:56,770 --> 01:02:00,540
I need to pick up
you and Jae Suk...

1712
01:02:01,040 --> 01:02:02,380
and go to the opening.

1713
01:02:03,270 --> 01:02:04,440
I will send you his number.

1714
01:02:04,690 --> 01:02:05,810
- Okay.
- Okay.

1715
01:02:07,420 --> 01:02:08,480
This is fun.

1716
01:02:08,580 --> 01:02:09,850
I didn't get any sleep yesterday,

1717
01:02:09,960 --> 01:02:11,480
but it's fun being here.

1718
01:02:11,480 --> 01:02:12,630
(Sung Oh, the variety show newbie,
is excited.)

1719
01:02:13,690 --> 01:02:15,100
(To get his team members'
phone numbers,)

1720
01:02:15,100 --> 01:02:16,750
(he calls his acquaintance, Ji Hyo.)

1721
01:02:16,750 --> 01:02:20,000
The number you have dialed
is unavailable.

1722
01:02:20,000 --> 01:02:21,100
Is she not picking up on purpose?

1723
01:02:21,100 --> 01:02:22,440
(No way.)

1724
01:02:22,440 --> 01:02:24,440
I feel like
people are scheming already.

1725
01:02:25,730 --> 01:02:26,900
Then...

1726
01:02:26,900 --> 01:02:28,170
(He becomes nervous.)

1727
01:02:29,230 --> 01:02:30,440
(He has no choice
but to call Jae Hong.)

1728
01:02:30,440 --> 01:02:31,580
Jae Hong.

1729
01:02:31,580 --> 01:02:32,600
Did you meet your team members?

1730
01:02:32,980 --> 01:02:35,940
I am almost done now.

1731
01:02:36,080 --> 01:02:40,290
You told Jae Suk
that he is on your team.

1732
01:02:40,290 --> 01:02:41,480
(What?)

1733
01:02:41,480 --> 01:02:42,880
- Me?
- Yes.

1734
01:02:43,150 --> 01:02:44,350
That's what he said.

1735
01:02:44,350 --> 01:02:45,790
(He throws another lie.)

1736
01:02:45,790 --> 01:02:47,190
I can't do this.

1737
01:02:47,190 --> 01:02:48,500
Everyone lies.

1738
01:02:49,420 --> 01:02:51,130
I don't know.
I haven't found anyone yet.

1739
01:02:51,190 --> 01:02:53,330
I don't think
I will be able to star on the show.

1740
01:02:53,330 --> 01:02:54,630
The shoot will end
before I find anyone.

1741
01:02:54,630 --> 01:02:56,940
Please give me So Min's number.

1742
01:02:56,940 --> 01:02:59,540
I need to meet my team members.
I just got on the van.

1743
01:02:59,600 --> 01:03:00,770
So Min.

1744
01:03:00,770 --> 01:03:01,810
(Hanging up)

1745
01:03:02,100 --> 01:03:03,230
So Min.

1746
01:03:04,580 --> 01:03:06,400
This is unbelievable.
Is this how it usually goes?

1747
01:03:06,400 --> 01:03:07,420
(It's a culture shock.)

1748
01:03:07,920 --> 01:03:09,380
He just hung up!

1749
01:03:11,120 --> 01:03:13,420
(Rummaging)

1750
01:03:13,960 --> 01:03:15,380
Entertainment...

1751
01:03:15,880 --> 01:03:17,190
YES IM...

1752
01:03:17,190 --> 01:03:21,900
(He searches the web and calls
the team members' agencies.)

1753
01:03:23,690 --> 01:03:25,870
- It's a weekday, right?
- Yes, it is.

1754
01:03:26,520 --> 01:03:28,000
Why is no one picking up?

1755
01:03:28,870 --> 01:03:31,940
I called So Min's agency,
but no one is picking up. It's 10am.

1756
01:03:31,940 --> 01:03:33,710
(He is the 1st guest to call
the members' agencies.)

1757
01:03:35,130 --> 01:03:36,600
(While Sung Oh searches
for their phone numbers,)

1758
01:03:36,600 --> 01:03:38,080
(Jong Kook waits for the captain.)

1759
01:03:38,080 --> 01:03:40,250
It's so strange
that no one is calling me.

1760
01:03:40,250 --> 01:03:41,380
(Why is no one calling me?)

1761
01:03:42,270 --> 01:03:44,350
Who on earth is the captain?

1762
01:03:45,210 --> 01:03:46,620
For goodness' sake.

1763
01:03:47,380 --> 01:03:49,060
I am beginning to get angry.

1764
01:03:49,850 --> 01:03:51,850
Everyone got a call except for me.

1765
01:03:52,730 --> 01:03:54,060
Unbelievable.

1766
01:03:54,060 --> 01:03:56,250
(Will Sung Oh's team be able
to meet?)

1767
01:03:57,370 --> 01:03:58,870
(Jae Suk calls someone.)

1768
01:03:58,870 --> 01:04:00,000
She picked up right away.

1769
01:04:00,730 --> 01:04:01,870
Hello.

1770
01:04:01,960 --> 01:04:05,000
<i>The flowers sway</i>

1771
01:04:05,400 --> 01:04:08,770
(So Min sings
Jae Hong's theme song in a drama.)

1772
01:04:08,770 --> 01:04:09,770
So Min.

1773
01:04:09,770 --> 01:04:12,770
You aren't in a drama with Jae Hong.

1774
01:04:13,500 --> 01:04:15,750
Jae Suk, there is
an unwanted member between us.

1775
01:04:15,850 --> 01:04:17,710
- Who is it?
- Se Chan.

1776
01:04:19,850 --> 01:04:21,750
(Her former love interest became
someone she wants to eliminate.)

1777
01:04:21,750 --> 01:04:23,980
This is interesting.

1778
01:04:24,650 --> 01:04:27,290
Sorry, Jae Suk. I have to go.

1779
01:04:28,250 --> 01:04:29,400
Where are you going?

1780
01:04:30,230 --> 01:04:31,790
For goodness' sake.

1781
01:04:31,790 --> 01:04:33,560
(She left to find love.)

1782
01:04:33,560 --> 01:04:35,370
So Min is so annoying.

1783
01:04:36,000 --> 01:04:37,170
So Min, where are you?

1784
01:04:37,290 --> 01:04:38,710
I am...

1785
01:04:39,100 --> 01:04:41,400
in front of the convenience store.
Are you here?

1786
01:04:41,400 --> 01:04:43,000
- I am nearly there.
- Okay.

1787
01:04:43,000 --> 01:04:45,210
I will go to greet you.

1788
01:04:45,380 --> 01:04:46,770
Are you nearly here?
Oh, that must be your van.

1789
01:04:46,880 --> 01:04:48,120
Jae Hong!

1790
01:04:48,120 --> 01:04:50,210
Oh, that must be your van. Jae Hong!

1791
01:04:50,270 --> 01:04:51,850
I am here. Hurry up.

1792
01:04:52,290 --> 01:04:53,540
Jae Hong.

1793
01:04:54,980 --> 01:04:57,190
I will go to you. Wait.

1794
01:04:57,210 --> 01:04:58,380
I will go to you.

1795
01:04:58,520 --> 01:05:00,080
Jae Hong, I will go to you.

1796
01:05:00,150 --> 01:05:01,290
Have you been well?

1797
01:05:03,500 --> 01:05:04,830
It's good to see you.

1798
01:05:04,830 --> 01:05:06,060
- Have you been well?
- Yes.

1799
01:05:06,170 --> 01:05:07,830
How did this happen?

1800
01:05:07,830 --> 01:05:09,230
Seriously.

1801
01:05:09,960 --> 01:05:11,710
Thank goodness you knew my number.

1802
01:05:11,710 --> 01:05:12,900
- If the guest...
- Seriously.

1803
01:05:13,330 --> 01:05:15,080
- didn't know my number...
- It's cold, right?

1804
01:05:15,580 --> 01:05:16,730
Let's go.

1805
01:05:16,730 --> 01:05:17,880
Do you want to go in first?

1806
01:05:18,940 --> 01:05:20,100
Have you been well?

1807
01:05:20,100 --> 01:05:21,920
Yes. My goodness.

1808
01:05:21,980 --> 01:05:24,980
<i>The flowers sway</i>

1809
01:05:25,650 --> 01:05:29,080
<i>And I smell your shampoo</i>

1810
01:05:29,790 --> 01:05:31,290
- My goodness.
- It's good to see you here.

1811
01:05:31,290 --> 01:05:32,290
Seriously.

1812
01:05:32,290 --> 01:05:34,100
All the guests had a lottery...

1813
01:05:34,190 --> 01:05:36,330
- and I got you and Se Chan.
- He is useless.

1814
01:05:36,850 --> 01:05:38,830
We need to go right away...

1815
01:05:38,830 --> 01:05:41,230
- to get a priority.
- Let's go.

1816
01:05:41,230 --> 01:05:42,560
That fool...

1817
01:05:42,630 --> 01:05:44,460
is going to Kwang Soo.

1818
01:05:44,460 --> 01:05:45,870
He doesn't know he is on our team.

1819
01:05:46,560 --> 01:05:47,730
- Really?
- Yes.

1820
01:05:48,600 --> 01:05:49,880
Let me call him.

1821
01:05:50,210 --> 01:05:51,500
Who is Kwang Soo's captain?

1822
01:05:51,600 --> 01:05:52,670
Hello.

1823
01:05:52,670 --> 01:05:53,770
- Kwang Soo.
- Hey.

1824
01:05:54,150 --> 01:05:56,270
You and I are on the same team.

1825
01:05:58,020 --> 01:05:59,650
(Hanging up)

1826
01:06:00,980 --> 01:06:02,520
(The line is dead.)

1827
01:06:04,580 --> 01:06:05,830
He has no trust in you.

1828
01:06:06,830 --> 01:06:08,250
She keeps getting worse.

1829
01:06:08,250 --> 01:06:09,460
It might as well be a condition.

1830
01:06:11,370 --> 01:06:12,500
Hello.

1831
01:06:12,520 --> 01:06:15,770
Sora, I will send you
Se Chan's number.

1832
01:06:15,770 --> 01:06:18,540
Please tell Se Chan
that he is on our team.

1833
01:06:18,960 --> 01:06:20,270
Okay.

1834
01:06:20,940 --> 01:06:22,310
Did you understand my words?

1835
01:06:22,400 --> 01:06:23,580
Yes.

1836
01:06:24,400 --> 01:06:26,670
- Okay.
- Should I pick up Se Chan as well?

1837
01:06:27,040 --> 01:06:30,250
We will lie to Se Chan
about being on our team...

1838
01:06:30,250 --> 01:06:32,940
so that his team will arrive late.

1839
01:06:32,940 --> 01:06:34,520
Jae Suk and I are
in your team, right?

1840
01:06:34,560 --> 01:06:35,710
That's right.

1841
01:06:36,080 --> 01:06:37,120
Okay.

1842
01:06:37,120 --> 01:06:38,650
(Did she really understand?)

1843
01:06:39,830 --> 01:06:41,790
I will be on my phone all day long.

1844
01:06:42,520 --> 01:06:44,000
Hold on.

1845
01:06:44,000 --> 01:06:45,100
What is this?

1846
01:06:45,670 --> 01:06:48,000
Hello.

1847
01:06:48,900 --> 01:06:51,630
Gosh, everyone is playing tricks.

1848
01:06:51,870 --> 01:06:55,040
All the captains are tricksters.
Who is this?

1849
01:06:55,400 --> 01:06:57,440
My name is Kang Sora.

1850
01:06:58,000 --> 01:06:59,810
I don't know
if I should believe you.

1851
01:06:59,810 --> 01:07:01,420
I got your phone number only now.

1852
01:07:01,420 --> 01:07:03,350
The line was busy too.

1853
01:07:03,420 --> 01:07:05,480
I am sorry, but it sounds like
you are acting.

1854
01:07:05,710 --> 01:07:07,920
You are trying to trick me.

1855
01:07:08,850 --> 01:07:10,210
Are you really a captain?

1856
01:07:10,210 --> 01:07:11,250
Yes.

1857
01:07:11,420 --> 01:07:14,920
- Okay. Then I will be on my way.
- Okay.

1858
01:07:14,920 --> 01:07:16,190
- Call me.
- Okay.

1859
01:07:16,290 --> 01:07:17,330
Please wait a bit longer.

1860
01:07:17,460 --> 01:07:19,330
- Okay.
- Okay.

1861
01:07:19,790 --> 01:07:21,560
The captains are dirty.

1862
01:07:21,560 --> 01:07:22,790
For goodness' sake.

1863
01:07:23,400 --> 01:07:24,730
Yeouido Park?

1864
01:07:24,730 --> 01:07:26,810
I will run to Yeouido Park.

1865
01:07:26,870 --> 01:07:27,880
The statue...

1866
01:07:27,880 --> 01:07:29,000
Yeo Been!

1867
01:07:29,940 --> 01:07:30,980
Where is she?

1868
01:07:30,980 --> 01:07:32,150
Yeo Been, I am here.

1869
01:07:32,600 --> 01:07:34,670
(The first meeting
between a captain and a team member)

1870
01:07:34,670 --> 01:07:36,080
(Suddenly, Haha enters.)

1871
01:07:36,080 --> 01:07:37,250
My goodness.

1872
01:07:37,250 --> 01:07:39,080
(An uninvited guest appears.)

1873
01:07:39,080 --> 01:07:40,290
Thank goodness.

1874
01:07:40,710 --> 01:07:42,480
- Thank goodness.
- Thank goodness.

1875
01:07:42,480 --> 01:07:43,620
No.

1876
01:07:43,620 --> 01:07:44,830
- Let's go.
- You're not on my team.

1877
01:07:44,830 --> 01:07:46,230
Why not?

1878
01:07:46,790 --> 01:07:48,250
(Aren't you my captain?)

1879
01:07:48,250 --> 01:07:50,000
- You're not on my team.
- Why not?

1880
01:07:50,150 --> 01:07:52,370
- Let's go.
- Let's hurry up.

1881
01:07:54,130 --> 01:07:55,460
Haha, I am sorry.

1882
01:07:56,830 --> 01:07:58,630
Sir, please get out.

1883
01:07:59,130 --> 01:08:00,230
If you get out...

1884
01:08:00,670 --> 01:08:02,770
(He tries to steal the van.)

1885
01:08:02,770 --> 01:08:04,500
I will drive.

1886
01:08:04,500 --> 01:08:05,770
(He is the politest car thief.)

1887
01:08:05,880 --> 01:08:07,040
Stay in the van.

1888
01:08:07,250 --> 01:08:08,920
- No.
- I will drive you there.

1889
01:08:09,420 --> 01:08:10,850
- Sir.
- No, no.

1890
01:08:10,850 --> 01:08:12,210
- No.
- No, no.

1891
01:08:12,310 --> 01:08:14,150
- Sir.
- No, no.

1892
01:08:14,310 --> 01:08:16,120
- No.
- No, no.

1893
01:08:16,380 --> 01:08:17,850
- All right. Let's go.
- No.

1894
01:08:17,980 --> 01:08:19,520
I will drive you there.

1895
01:08:19,520 --> 01:08:21,750
- What are you doing?
- I will drive you there.

1896
01:08:21,850 --> 01:08:24,460
- Go away!
- Yeo Been, it's nice to meet you.

1897
01:08:24,690 --> 01:08:26,730
You keep threatening me,

1898
01:08:26,730 --> 01:08:29,270
- but I can do the same.
- Okay.

1899
01:08:29,270 --> 01:08:31,330
If you keep threatening me,

1900
01:08:31,400 --> 01:08:33,230
- I will drive to Sokcho.
- We didn't...

1901
01:08:33,230 --> 01:08:34,770
- We understand.
- Okay?

1902
01:08:34,770 --> 01:08:36,710
- We didn't say anything.
- Do you want to eat mulhoe...

1903
01:08:36,710 --> 01:08:38,100
- at Sokcho?
- No, no.

1904
01:08:38,100 --> 01:08:40,500
You don't need to drive to Sokcho.

1905
01:08:40,500 --> 01:08:42,420
You know that I am a man of action.

1906
01:08:42,770 --> 01:08:44,040
(Meanwhile, Kwang Soo is waiting
for Se Chan.)

1907
01:08:44,040 --> 01:08:45,150
Hey.

1908
01:08:45,150 --> 01:08:46,210
Where are you?

1909
01:08:46,580 --> 01:08:47,690
Kwang Soo,

1910
01:08:47,810 --> 01:08:49,480
you know the opening location
of "2 Days 1 Night", right?

1911
01:08:49,920 --> 01:08:52,560
Do you think it would be a good idea
for us to go there?

1912
01:08:53,480 --> 01:08:54,790
Don't you know the opening location
of "2 Days 1 Night"?

1913
01:08:55,330 --> 01:08:56,900
I know, but...

1914
01:08:57,190 --> 01:08:58,830
How do you know it?

1915
01:08:59,690 --> 01:09:02,230
- What?
- Do you watch "2 Days 1 Night"?

1916
01:09:03,630 --> 01:09:04,830
It's not like that.

1917
01:09:04,830 --> 01:09:06,330
- A long time ago...
- I don't know where it is.

1918
01:09:06,330 --> 01:09:08,400
My head is filled
with the locations of Running Man.

1919
01:09:08,480 --> 01:09:10,480
I have an incoming call
from the captain.

1920
01:09:10,730 --> 01:09:12,650
- Hurry up and come here.
- Okay.

1921
01:09:14,270 --> 01:09:16,650
(When will Sora get here?)

1922
01:09:17,650 --> 01:09:18,690
Hello.

1923
01:09:18,690 --> 01:09:20,020
Where are you?

1924
01:09:20,040 --> 01:09:23,190
I am trying
to pick up Jae Suk first.

1925
01:09:23,190 --> 01:09:25,460
But the Han River Park is
so big that...

1926
01:09:25,650 --> 01:09:28,350
What do you see?

1927
01:09:28,500 --> 01:09:30,420
I am at Yeouido Park,
not the Han River Park.

1928
01:09:30,630 --> 01:09:32,370
- Yeouido Park?
- Yes.

1929
01:09:32,600 --> 01:09:37,190
I specifically asked you
if you understood what I had said.

1930
01:09:37,190 --> 01:09:39,510
- That's right.
- You keep saying that.

1931
01:09:39,510 --> 01:09:41,640
But I never mentioned
the Han River Park.

1932
01:09:41,640 --> 01:09:42,710
(I told you that
I'm at Yeouido Park so many times.)

1933
01:09:42,800 --> 01:09:45,300
- I will meet up with Se Chan.
- Okay.

1934
01:09:45,400 --> 01:09:46,470
What? Is that Ji Hyo?

1935
01:09:47,400 --> 01:09:48,580
What? Is that Ji Hyo?

1936
01:09:48,580 --> 01:09:50,180
(Yeo Been and Ji Hyo run
toward his direction.)

1937
01:09:51,340 --> 01:09:52,940
(They ignore Kwang Soo.)

1938
01:09:53,090 --> 01:09:55,590
- Yeo Been!
- Kwang Soo, hello.

1939
01:09:55,590 --> 01:09:56,720
Hey, you...

1940
01:09:57,220 --> 01:09:59,020
How could you go
without stopping to say hello?

1941
01:09:59,760 --> 01:10:00,830
What is going on?

1942
01:10:00,830 --> 01:10:02,220
(They run past Kwang Soo
and get on his van.)

1943
01:10:02,220 --> 01:10:03,930
- Let's go.
- Hurry up and get in.

1944
01:10:04,190 --> 01:10:05,260
Hurry up and get in.

1945
01:10:05,260 --> 01:10:08,260
(Captain Yeo Been and Ji Hyo
get into Kwang Soo's van.)

1946
01:10:09,060 --> 01:10:10,560
So this is how it works.

1947
01:10:11,300 --> 01:10:12,470
(Kwang Soo's van door closes.)

1948
01:10:12,470 --> 01:10:14,680
- Lock the door.
- Close the door. Hurry up.

1949
01:10:14,680 --> 01:10:15,970
- What's going on?
- Close the door.

1950
01:10:16,100 --> 01:10:18,340
- What's wrong?
- Close the door.

1951
01:10:18,340 --> 01:10:19,340
What?

1952
01:10:20,080 --> 01:10:22,050
Why did they get in my van?

1953
01:10:22,640 --> 01:10:25,010
Please take us to exit nine.

1954
01:10:25,180 --> 01:10:26,340
Kwang Soo.

1955
01:10:26,340 --> 01:10:27,420
(Se Chan came for Kwang Soo.)

1956
01:10:27,420 --> 01:10:29,420
- Hey.
- I'll pick up Jae Suk first.

1957
01:10:29,420 --> 01:10:30,980
Lower your voice.
I'm talking to Se Chan.

1958
01:10:31,150 --> 01:10:32,430
I just...

1959
01:10:32,430 --> 01:10:33,830
(Se Chan is confused
because Jae Hong called him.)

1960
01:10:33,830 --> 01:10:36,520
- Ahn Jae Hong.
- He called me too.

1961
01:10:36,550 --> 01:10:38,520
Hang up.

1962
01:10:38,520 --> 01:10:40,090
Se Chan, he's trying to trick you.

1963
01:10:41,190 --> 01:10:42,840
- Is it Sora?
- Hang up. Yes.

1964
01:10:43,590 --> 01:10:46,100
- But this...
- You got your van stolen.

1965
01:10:46,560 --> 01:10:49,640
If you don't meet your captain
and fall behind,

1966
01:10:49,730 --> 01:10:51,470
you have to walk
to the opening location.

1967
01:10:51,470 --> 01:10:53,270
- Why doesn't he have a van?
- Just now,

1968
01:10:53,400 --> 01:10:56,720
Ji Hyo and Yeo Been took his van.

1969
01:10:56,940 --> 01:10:58,050
They have our van?

1970
01:10:58,050 --> 01:11:00,250
Shouldn't I report this
to the police?

1971
01:11:00,510 --> 01:11:02,010
That's not fair.

1972
01:11:02,150 --> 01:11:03,290
- Hold on.
- Who is it?

1973
01:11:03,390 --> 01:11:04,650
Hello. Se Chan.

1974
01:11:05,290 --> 01:11:07,290
(Sora met up with Jae Suk.
She's calling Kwang Soo now.)

1975
01:11:07,290 --> 01:11:08,720
- Hello?
- Where are you now?

1976
01:11:08,720 --> 01:11:10,630
I'm leaving now.

1977
01:11:10,630 --> 01:11:12,470
You said we're on the same team
as Se Chan.

1978
01:11:12,630 --> 01:11:14,670
- What?
- Is it the three of us?

1979
01:11:14,670 --> 01:11:16,640
No, I picked up Jae Suk.

1980
01:11:16,640 --> 01:11:17,870
(She's clueless.)

1981
01:11:19,010 --> 01:11:21,180
(But Se Chan...)

1982
01:11:21,180 --> 01:11:22,510
Are we on Jae Suk's team?

1983
01:11:22,800 --> 01:11:24,140
Who's on our side?

1984
01:11:24,340 --> 01:11:28,680
I told you multiple times.

1985
01:11:28,680 --> 01:11:30,180
(He's flustered.)

1986
01:11:30,180 --> 01:11:31,220
Hello?

1987
01:11:31,220 --> 01:11:32,750
(You have to trick Se Chan.)

1988
01:11:32,750 --> 01:11:34,050
Hello?

1989
01:11:35,390 --> 01:11:38,850
I just... This is driving me nuts.

1990
01:11:39,350 --> 01:11:41,460
Excuse me, Sora.

1991
01:11:41,550 --> 01:11:43,930
I'm Se Chan.
I thought we were on the same team.

1992
01:11:43,930 --> 01:11:45,430
Forget it.

1993
01:11:45,430 --> 01:11:46,630
What did you do?

1994
01:11:46,630 --> 01:11:49,390
Forget it. We're going to go first.

1995
01:11:49,390 --> 01:11:51,210
Put Kwang Soo on the phone.

1996
01:11:51,210 --> 01:11:52,560
Sora.

1997
01:11:52,710 --> 01:11:57,430
How many times did I ask you
if you understood me?

1998
01:11:57,940 --> 01:11:59,940
(What?)

1999
01:12:01,250 --> 01:12:02,420
(While Se Chan wasn't paying
attention, he stole the phone.)

2000
01:12:02,420 --> 01:12:04,440
Give it back.

2001
01:12:05,140 --> 01:12:07,390
I have to get going. Don't go.

2002
01:12:07,510 --> 01:12:09,010
I stole Se Chan's phone.

2003
01:12:09,150 --> 01:12:10,650
I'm running away.

2004
01:12:10,650 --> 01:12:12,150
Give me my phone back!

2005
01:12:12,150 --> 01:12:13,890
I can't go without it.

2006
01:12:14,220 --> 01:12:15,630
I'm sorry, Se Chan!

2007
01:12:15,630 --> 01:12:16,800
(He's a nice thief.)

2008
01:12:16,800 --> 01:12:17,830
I'm sorry!

2009
01:12:18,500 --> 01:12:21,430
We can't even be aired. We're going
back and forth in front of KBS.

2010
01:12:21,430 --> 01:12:23,190
We won't be aired.

2011
01:12:23,190 --> 01:12:24,640
(Se Chan lost his phone
and his team.)

2012
01:12:24,640 --> 01:12:26,140
Goodness, Kwang Soo.

2013
01:12:26,670 --> 01:12:29,230
Where is Se Chan?

2014
01:12:29,230 --> 01:12:30,580
We have to pick him up, right?

2015
01:12:30,680 --> 01:12:33,750
- We just have to pick him up.
- Then we're done.

2016
01:12:34,080 --> 01:12:36,220
Gosh, you brought luck.

2017
01:12:36,220 --> 01:12:38,050
- I know.
- Things are going smoothly.

2018
01:12:38,050 --> 01:12:39,920
(Sorry, So Min.)

2019
01:12:40,940 --> 01:12:42,980
(Jae Hong is calling Se Chan.)

2020
01:12:42,980 --> 01:12:44,350
Where are you? Hurry up.

2021
01:12:44,350 --> 01:12:47,090
- We're in front of the banner.
- Hangang Park.

2022
01:12:47,090 --> 01:12:48,720
- I'm at Hangang Park.
- Hurry up. Run.

2023
01:12:48,960 --> 01:12:50,130
Hangang Park.

2024
01:12:50,130 --> 01:12:51,590
- Run.
- Where is he?

2025
01:12:51,590 --> 01:12:54,170
- Hangang Park.
- Everybody met up.

2026
01:12:54,170 --> 01:12:55,540
We have to hurry.

2027
01:12:56,170 --> 01:12:57,560
I'm at Hangang Park.

2028
01:12:57,560 --> 01:12:59,060
Why aren't you talking?

2029
01:12:59,260 --> 01:13:00,970
Hangang Park.

2030
01:13:00,970 --> 01:13:02,680
Why are you at Hangang Park?

2031
01:13:03,140 --> 01:13:05,050
(Se Chan was walking.)

2032
01:13:05,050 --> 01:13:06,340
I think that's our van.

2033
01:13:06,510 --> 01:13:07,880
I think that's our van.

2034
01:13:08,920 --> 01:13:11,420
- Come here.
- Why aren't you talking?

2035
01:13:11,420 --> 01:13:13,090
(She was talking
to the fake Se Chan.)

2036
01:13:13,790 --> 01:13:15,310
Why are you at Hangang Park?

2037
01:13:15,310 --> 01:13:19,050
(The real Se Chan is here.)

2038
01:13:19,350 --> 01:13:20,630
I'll just get on.

2039
01:13:21,460 --> 01:13:23,090
Se Chan!

2040
01:13:23,090 --> 01:13:24,220
Who is it?

2041
01:13:25,170 --> 01:13:26,330
Jae Suk!

2042
01:13:26,330 --> 01:13:28,470
(Devil's advocate)

2043
01:13:30,190 --> 01:13:31,260
Jae Suk!

2044
01:13:31,260 --> 01:13:32,340
Hurry!

2045
01:13:32,510 --> 01:13:33,560
What's going on?

2046
01:13:33,560 --> 01:13:34,930
Where are you going?

2047
01:13:34,930 --> 01:13:36,540
Kwang Soo stole...

2048
01:13:36,800 --> 01:13:39,100
my phone, so I fell behind.

2049
01:13:39,680 --> 01:13:40,840
- Where?
- Hurry. This way.

2050
01:13:40,840 --> 01:13:41,970
- Am I on your team?
- Yes.

2051
01:13:41,970 --> 01:13:43,420
- Really?
- We were looking for you.

2052
01:13:43,420 --> 01:13:45,340
- Really? Are you sure?
- Hurry.

2053
01:13:45,340 --> 01:13:46,550
Hurry up.

2054
01:13:46,550 --> 01:13:48,480
You're not supposed to be there.

2055
01:13:49,050 --> 01:13:51,850
We're by the main building of KBS.

2056
01:13:51,850 --> 01:13:54,020
Come to
the National Assembly Building.

2057
01:13:54,590 --> 01:13:56,630
Come to
the National Assembly Building.

2058
01:13:57,300 --> 01:13:58,630
This is Kwang Soo, right?

2059
01:14:00,500 --> 01:14:01,870
You're Kwang Soo, right?

2060
01:14:03,590 --> 01:14:05,300
Where's Se Chan? Hurry up.

2061
01:14:05,510 --> 01:14:08,040
We were looking for you.
You don't have a phone.

2062
01:14:08,040 --> 01:14:10,210
- Kwang Soo took mine.
- What a huge relief.

2063
01:14:10,730 --> 01:14:12,580
- Where are we going?
- Come this way. Get on.

2064
01:14:12,580 --> 01:14:14,720
- Who is it?
- Why don't you have a phone?

2065
01:14:14,720 --> 01:14:16,470
- Were you serious?
- Yes.

2066
01:14:16,880 --> 01:14:18,180
Get in the back.

2067
01:14:18,310 --> 01:14:19,620
Goodness.

2068
01:14:19,620 --> 01:14:20,750
We looked for a long time.

2069
01:14:20,750 --> 01:14:22,890
- Sora, you were serious. Hi.
- Hurry up.

2070
01:14:23,150 --> 01:14:25,050
- What was that?
- Kwang Soo...

2071
01:14:25,480 --> 01:14:26,890
stole my phone.

2072
01:14:26,890 --> 01:14:28,650
What's wrong with him?

2073
01:14:28,650 --> 01:14:30,300
- Are we really on the same team?
- Yes.

2074
01:14:30,300 --> 01:14:31,300
Really?

2075
01:14:31,300 --> 01:14:33,590
You didn't have a phone,
so we looked for a long time.

2076
01:14:33,590 --> 01:14:34,840
Jae Suk, I...

2077
01:14:35,040 --> 01:14:36,170
Now,

2078
01:14:37,060 --> 01:14:38,930
we have a team, so let's go.

2079
01:14:39,340 --> 01:14:40,560
Are we good then?

2080
01:14:40,560 --> 01:14:43,010
- Yes, it's you, me, and Sora.
- Gosh, Kwang Soo.

2081
01:14:43,010 --> 01:14:47,140
He didn't trust Sora,
so he said he's on her team.

2082
01:14:47,140 --> 01:14:49,880
He snatched my phone
and went to meet up with her.

2083
01:14:51,120 --> 01:14:52,250
Where are you?

2084
01:14:53,390 --> 01:14:54,680
I'm...

2085
01:14:55,260 --> 01:14:57,650
at Yeouido Park by exit six.

2086
01:15:00,020 --> 01:15:02,760
It's not there.
We're by the main building of KBS.

2087
01:15:02,890 --> 01:15:04,500
We're by the main building.
Come this way.

2088
01:15:05,170 --> 01:15:06,190
Hurry up.

2089
01:15:06,190 --> 01:15:07,520
How did you get your phone stolen?

2090
01:15:07,520 --> 01:15:09,560
He was talking to you.

2091
01:15:09,690 --> 01:15:11,230
I had it, but he snatched it.

2092
01:15:11,230 --> 01:15:12,840
- Hold on, Jae Suk.
- What?

2093
01:15:13,100 --> 01:15:16,040
Sora,
we have our team. Look.

2094
01:15:16,040 --> 01:15:17,730
We have to go to
our destination then.

2095
01:15:17,730 --> 01:15:19,510
We have to take your phone.

2096
01:15:19,510 --> 01:15:21,250
We have to communicate through this.

2097
01:15:21,250 --> 01:15:23,340
Why do we need to?
There are three of us.

2098
01:15:23,340 --> 01:15:25,050
- That's true, but...
- We have to meet again.

2099
01:15:25,050 --> 01:15:27,420
Hold on, Jae Suk.

2100
01:15:27,420 --> 01:15:30,390
I'm not on this team, right?

2101
01:15:30,390 --> 01:15:32,460
(Se Chan is smarter than
they think.)

2102
01:15:32,460 --> 01:15:35,000
(She blocks his way.)

2103
01:15:36,130 --> 01:15:37,650
Move. Move!

2104
01:15:37,650 --> 01:15:39,500
You bad people! Move.

2105
01:15:39,500 --> 01:15:41,300
Sora, gosh.

2106
01:15:41,300 --> 01:15:43,430
You too. Kwang Soo.

2107
01:15:43,430 --> 01:15:44,930
Move.

2108
01:15:45,040 --> 01:15:46,470
Stay in our van.

2109
01:15:46,470 --> 01:15:48,380
(He loses time but escapes.)

2110
01:15:48,380 --> 01:15:49,930
(Grabbing)

2111
01:15:50,970 --> 01:15:52,010
Get out.

2112
01:15:52,010 --> 01:15:54,010
(They almost tricked him.)

2113
01:15:54,010 --> 01:15:55,720
- My time!
- Se Chan.

2114
01:15:55,720 --> 01:15:57,220
Gosh, Kwang Soo.

2115
01:15:57,220 --> 01:15:58,440
My gosh.

2116
01:15:59,250 --> 01:16:00,640
(We should have held
onto him longer.)

2117
01:16:00,640 --> 01:16:01,760
We should have gone.

2118
01:16:01,850 --> 01:16:03,390
Where are you?

2119
01:16:03,480 --> 01:16:05,390
- I'm...
- Who is it?

2120
01:16:05,390 --> 01:16:06,850
Se Chan.

2121
01:16:06,850 --> 01:16:08,090
- Hey!
- I'm...

2122
01:16:08,090 --> 01:16:10,590
(They see Suk Jin passing by.)

2123
01:16:10,960 --> 01:16:12,260
Se Chan.

2124
01:16:12,260 --> 01:16:13,690
I'll get him.

2125
01:16:15,930 --> 01:16:17,260
Suk Jin!

2126
01:16:17,260 --> 01:16:18,710
(Crying)

2127
01:16:19,060 --> 01:16:20,600
- Who is it?
- Hurry up.

2128
01:16:21,140 --> 01:16:22,380
Where are you?

2129
01:16:22,380 --> 01:16:23,710
I was waiting for you. Hurry up.

2130
01:16:23,710 --> 01:16:24,770
- Is it you?
- Yes.

2131
01:16:24,770 --> 01:16:25,800
No, I'm on Jae Hong's team.

2132
01:16:25,800 --> 01:16:27,880
You're not on his team.

2133
01:16:27,880 --> 01:16:29,580
- Really?
- We kept on looking for you.

2134
01:16:29,580 --> 01:16:30,640
Sora?

2135
01:16:30,640 --> 01:16:32,220
Yes, get on.

2136
01:16:32,220 --> 01:16:34,310
- Jae Hong said...
- Get in the back. Let's go.

2137
01:16:34,310 --> 01:16:35,680
Jae Hong said...

2138
01:16:35,680 --> 01:16:37,720
- You're not on his team.
- I have to meet him.

2139
01:16:37,720 --> 01:16:39,850
You're not on Jae Hong's team.

2140
01:16:39,850 --> 01:16:42,090
It's Sora, me, and you.
What are you talking about?

2141
01:16:42,090 --> 01:16:43,520
- Really?
- Yes.

2142
01:16:43,520 --> 01:16:46,000
Why didn't you call me then?

2143
01:16:46,000 --> 01:16:47,260
This is so chaotic.

2144
01:16:47,260 --> 01:16:48,800
I don't think I'm on this team.

2145
01:16:48,800 --> 01:16:50,090
You are.

2146
01:16:50,090 --> 01:16:51,430
- I don't think I'm on this team.
- Let's get going.

2147
01:16:51,430 --> 01:16:53,230
- I'm not on this team.
- Let's go.

2148
01:16:53,230 --> 01:16:54,710
Put your seat belt on.

2149
01:16:54,710 --> 01:16:59,100
Why are you not happy to see him?
He's on our team.

2150
01:16:59,100 --> 01:17:00,180
(I can't do this.)

2151
01:17:00,180 --> 01:17:01,550
- Excuse me.
- Sora.

2152
01:17:01,550 --> 01:17:03,580
- I'm not.
- He's on our team.

2153
01:17:03,580 --> 01:17:05,640
He's on our team.
Why aren't you happy to see him?

2154
01:17:05,840 --> 01:17:07,890
- I'm not on your team.
- I was startled.

2155
01:17:07,890 --> 01:17:09,550
We're on the same team.
Why aren't you happy to see him?

2156
01:17:09,550 --> 01:17:10,620
Move.

2157
01:17:11,290 --> 01:17:13,650
I can tell from her face!

2158
01:17:13,650 --> 01:17:14,800
Move!

2159
01:17:14,800 --> 01:17:17,000
- It's obvious.
- Goodness.

2160
01:17:17,930 --> 01:17:19,970
Sora can't lie.

2161
01:17:19,970 --> 01:17:21,970
Move. I'm not on this team.

2162
01:17:22,090 --> 01:17:23,390
Hey.

2163
01:17:23,560 --> 01:17:25,040
Sora.

2164
01:17:25,040 --> 01:17:27,400
Why are you doing this?

2165
01:17:27,840 --> 01:17:29,210
Why is everybody...

2166
01:17:29,210 --> 01:17:30,210
(Se Chan is still by KBS.)

2167
01:17:30,210 --> 01:17:32,970
Why is everybody trying to get me?

2168
01:17:33,340 --> 01:17:35,680
Here. Se Chan! Run!

2169
01:17:35,680 --> 01:17:37,140
It's here!

2170
01:17:37,680 --> 01:17:38,940
Se Chan!

2171
01:17:38,940 --> 01:17:40,550
Yang Se Chan!

2172
01:17:40,550 --> 01:17:42,310
I'm at Yeouido Park by exit six.

2173
01:17:42,310 --> 01:17:43,810
Run.

2174
01:17:44,150 --> 01:17:45,430
Where are you?

2175
01:17:45,430 --> 01:17:47,430
- He got his phone stolen?
- Yes.

2176
01:17:47,430 --> 01:17:48,760
He got it stolen.

2177
01:17:48,760 --> 01:17:51,330
- Why did you get your phone stolen?
- We waited for you. Let's go.

2178
01:17:51,330 --> 01:17:53,560
- Let's get going.
- Jae Suk held me.

2179
01:17:53,670 --> 01:17:55,640
- I got everything stolen.
- Hurry up.

2180
01:17:55,640 --> 01:17:57,230
- Hurry. We're ready.
- Hurry up.

2181
01:17:57,230 --> 01:17:58,760
- There was bloodshed.
- Hurry up.

2182
01:17:58,760 --> 01:18:00,170
Get in.

2183
01:18:00,510 --> 01:18:01,800
Hurry.

2184
01:18:02,080 --> 01:18:04,730
We have to get going. We might lose.

2185
01:18:04,730 --> 01:18:06,180
(If this was the team, they would
get told the destination.)

2186
01:18:06,180 --> 01:18:07,970
Where do we need to go?

2187
01:18:08,620 --> 01:18:11,140
Should we pick up Haha too?

2188
01:18:11,140 --> 01:18:13,090
Let's go somewhere else.

2189
01:18:13,480 --> 01:18:15,760
I want to say hi to him.

2190
01:18:16,420 --> 01:18:18,460
We're not a team then.

2191
01:18:18,460 --> 01:18:19,630
- What? I'm not on this team?
- Are we not?

2192
01:18:19,630 --> 01:18:22,590
Jae Hong, if I'm not on this team,
I'd be very disappointed.

2193
01:18:22,590 --> 01:18:24,870
Jae Hong, I have a reason now.

2194
01:18:24,870 --> 01:18:26,330
I can beat somebody up now.

2195
01:18:26,330 --> 01:18:28,470
I have a reason to beat somebody up.

2196
01:18:28,470 --> 01:18:29,890
I'm going to beat somebody up.

2197
01:18:29,890 --> 01:18:31,340
- You have to trust me.
- Who?

2198
01:18:31,640 --> 01:18:32,730
- You?
- Me.

2199
01:18:32,730 --> 01:18:34,710
Really? Is Haha on our team?

2200
01:18:36,380 --> 01:18:38,300
(Meanwhile, Sung Oh is...)

2201
01:18:39,970 --> 01:18:42,080
We'll be done
by the time I find them.

2202
01:18:46,250 --> 01:18:48,290
Should we go eat?

2203
01:18:48,920 --> 01:18:52,520
(He couldn't reach anybody,
so he had almost given up.)

2204
01:18:52,830 --> 01:18:54,480
There he is.

2205
01:18:55,630 --> 01:18:57,460
- We're coming.
- Jae Hong.

2206
01:18:57,800 --> 01:19:00,500
- Yes? Where are you?
- Brace yourself.

2207
01:19:00,630 --> 01:19:02,370
- I will.
- Can you stop here?

2208
01:19:02,370 --> 01:19:03,690
(He finally got a chance to talk
after an hour.)

2209
01:19:03,690 --> 01:19:05,900
- Goodness.
- Where?

2210
01:19:05,900 --> 01:19:07,400
Hello.

2211
01:19:07,400 --> 01:19:09,210
Hold on. What's going on?

2212
01:19:09,210 --> 01:19:10,430
- Hello.
- Hold on.

2213
01:19:10,430 --> 01:19:12,510
- I have to find people.
- What happened?

2214
01:19:12,510 --> 01:19:14,510
I couldn't find you.

2215
01:19:14,510 --> 01:19:16,750
Who's on your team?

2216
01:19:16,750 --> 01:19:18,080
Your team.

2217
01:19:18,080 --> 01:19:19,790
You two.

2218
01:19:19,890 --> 01:19:21,760
- Are you sure?
- Don't do that.

2219
01:19:21,760 --> 01:19:24,420
- Are you serious?
- This is driving me nuts.

2220
01:19:24,420 --> 01:19:26,350
I don't think I can do this.

2221
01:19:26,350 --> 01:19:27,430
(He's exhausted.)

2222
01:19:27,720 --> 01:19:30,000
I woke up at 5 a.m.

2223
01:19:30,300 --> 01:19:32,500
Everybody's lying.

2224
01:19:32,870 --> 01:19:35,430
- Is this real TV?
- No, so...

2225
01:19:35,430 --> 01:19:38,000
- You have to be somewhat truthful.
- But then...

2226
01:19:38,000 --> 01:19:40,370
Nobody trusts me
or answers my calls.

2227
01:19:40,370 --> 01:19:41,770
- What's this now?
- Fine.

2228
01:19:41,770 --> 01:19:44,770
We sometimes...

2229
01:19:44,770 --> 01:19:46,900
don't trust the guests,

2230
01:19:46,900 --> 01:19:48,840
but I can't trust you even more.

2231
01:19:48,840 --> 01:19:49,940
(He always plays the villain.)

2232
01:19:49,940 --> 01:19:51,890
I'm leaving.

2233
01:19:52,310 --> 01:19:55,180
- This doesn't make sense.
- That's not why. Listen.

2234
01:19:55,180 --> 01:19:57,260
- Wait. He's calling again.
- I thought it was going to be easy.

2235
01:19:57,550 --> 01:20:00,350
Look. I looked you up
on the internet.

2236
01:20:00,350 --> 01:20:02,090
You can't find my number online.

2237
01:20:02,090 --> 01:20:04,130
- I was looking up your agency.
- My agency.

2238
01:20:04,130 --> 01:20:06,300
I called your agency,
but why aren't they picking up?

2239
01:20:06,760 --> 01:20:10,260
- You called my agency.
- It's 10 a.m. on a weekday.

2240
01:20:10,260 --> 01:20:12,540
- Why aren't they working?
- You called my agency?

2241
01:20:12,540 --> 01:20:14,100
- Convince me.
- Hold on.

2242
01:20:14,100 --> 01:20:16,010
- I have Jae Hong on the phone.
- Listen.

2243
01:20:16,010 --> 01:20:18,010
- I figured it out too.
- Talk to him.

2244
01:20:18,010 --> 01:20:20,050
- Jae Hong.
- Yes. Where are you?

2245
01:20:20,050 --> 01:20:22,220
Hey, let's not do this.

2246
01:20:23,180 --> 01:20:26,180
- No one believes me. Seriously.
- Wait. Hey.

2247
01:20:26,180 --> 01:20:28,310
Hey, let's not do this.

2248
01:20:28,310 --> 01:20:31,420
My head hurts too.
It's too early in the morning.

2249
01:20:31,420 --> 01:20:33,960
I admit that I do lie a lot.

2250
01:20:33,960 --> 01:20:37,150
But no one will believe me.
Nothing will come of this.

2251
01:20:37,150 --> 01:20:40,390
- Let me.
- I don't care if I place last.

2252
01:20:40,390 --> 01:20:42,730
- Hello.
- Jae Hong.

2253
01:20:42,730 --> 01:20:43,760
- Hello.
- Hello.

2254
01:20:43,760 --> 01:20:46,670
- That's Sung Oh.
- Hello, I'm the chief producer.

2255
01:20:46,670 --> 01:20:48,210
(Hello, I'm the chief producer.)

2256
01:20:48,210 --> 01:20:49,840
- Who?
- It's Se Chan.

2257
01:20:49,840 --> 01:20:52,010
You scumbag. That's enough!

2258
01:20:52,010 --> 01:20:53,680
(Haha gives Se Chan
New Year's words of blessings.)

2259
01:20:53,680 --> 01:20:56,050
Don't curse at me.
I'm frustrated too.

2260
01:20:56,050 --> 01:20:57,810
Where are you? Let's meet.

2261
01:20:58,550 --> 01:21:00,050
He's trying to buy time.

2262
01:21:00,050 --> 01:21:02,220
Right.
Jae Hong is trying to buy time.

2263
01:21:02,220 --> 01:21:04,220
- That's that.
- Who are on your team?

2264
01:21:04,220 --> 01:21:06,550
You always play this,
so there's no reason to go all out.

2265
01:21:06,550 --> 01:21:08,330
But why is everyone lying?

2266
01:21:08,330 --> 01:21:09,390
- It's not that.
- What?

2267
01:21:09,390 --> 01:21:10,500
Let's get in.

2268
01:21:11,350 --> 01:21:15,190
I mean,
you should have called me sooner.

2269
01:21:15,300 --> 01:21:18,000
We were wondering
why our captain wasn't calling us.

2270
01:21:18,760 --> 01:21:21,600
All right.
The three of you are here,

2271
01:21:21,640 --> 01:21:24,040
- but I cannot give you the address.
- Come on. Unbelievable.

2272
01:21:24,040 --> 01:21:25,940
- I can't believe him.
- Why are you doing this?

2273
01:21:25,940 --> 01:21:28,510
(His anger has dissipated now.)

2274
01:21:28,510 --> 01:21:29,770
(As they figure out that he lied,
he becomes an innocent lamb.)

2275
01:21:29,770 --> 01:21:31,310
When I spotted you two...

2276
01:21:31,310 --> 01:21:33,180
- He's unbelievable.
- Listen.

2277
01:21:33,550 --> 01:21:34,720
Both of you...

2278
01:21:35,220 --> 01:21:36,220
- This...
- Wait.

2279
01:21:36,220 --> 01:21:37,550
- This is...
- I don't get it.

2280
01:21:37,550 --> 01:21:39,130
Who's on your team?

2281
01:21:39,130 --> 01:21:40,220
- I'll be honest.
- Who is it?

2282
01:21:40,220 --> 01:21:41,850
- Sung Oh.
- I'll really be honest.

2283
01:21:41,850 --> 01:21:43,190
Turn off the camera.

2284
01:21:43,190 --> 01:21:44,800
- I'll really be honest.
- We can't turn that off.

2285
01:21:44,800 --> 01:21:47,090
You and I are on the same team.

2286
01:21:47,090 --> 01:21:49,000
And we need to find So Min.

2287
01:21:49,000 --> 01:21:50,540
- Really? Are you sure?
- Yes.

2288
01:21:50,540 --> 01:21:52,510
- Yes.
- Are you sure?

2289
01:21:52,510 --> 01:21:54,400
Hold on. Wait!

2290
01:21:54,400 --> 01:21:55,930
- Hold on a second.
- Stay here.

2291
01:21:55,930 --> 01:21:58,100
Okay. You might run away. Wait.

2292
01:21:58,100 --> 01:22:00,680
We need to keep a member
that's not on our team.

2293
01:22:01,180 --> 01:22:03,380
- What are you doing?
- I get it.

2294
01:22:03,380 --> 01:22:05,120
- What is this?
- Don't move.

2295
01:22:05,120 --> 01:22:06,390
That's right.

2296
01:22:06,390 --> 01:22:07,420
Jae Suk!

2297
01:22:07,420 --> 01:22:08,720
(Meanwhile, other teams...)

2298
01:22:08,720 --> 01:22:10,960
- Come quickly.
- Hurry.

2299
01:22:11,310 --> 01:22:13,150
- Let's go.
- Gosh, Se Chan.

2300
01:22:13,960 --> 01:22:15,330
I have Se Chan's phone.

2301
01:22:15,330 --> 01:22:17,090
- Nice to meet you.
- Sora.

2302
01:22:17,090 --> 01:22:18,390
- It's crazy, right?
- Things are so hectic.

2303
01:22:18,390 --> 01:22:20,830
- This is so exhausting. Hello.
- Goodness.

2304
01:22:20,830 --> 01:22:23,090
- All three of you are here.
- Okay.

2305
01:22:23,090 --> 01:22:24,730
- You can go to this address.
- Okay.

2306
01:22:24,730 --> 01:22:26,470
- That's SBS.
- You know where it is, right?

2307
01:22:26,470 --> 01:22:27,710
Yes, it's SBS.

2308
01:22:27,710 --> 01:22:29,210
See? You were with us. I told you.

2309
01:22:29,210 --> 01:22:31,210
- Right.
- See?

2310
01:22:31,210 --> 01:22:33,050
- I'm sorry.
- You were with us.

2311
01:22:33,800 --> 01:22:35,080
Hold on.

2312
01:22:35,270 --> 01:22:37,050
- Yes.
- Where are you?

2313
01:22:37,420 --> 01:22:38,440
Tell So Min...

2314
01:22:38,440 --> 01:22:39,940
I don't know.
I'm done with today's filming.

2315
01:22:39,940 --> 01:22:40,940
(He's totally exhausted.)

2316
01:22:41,120 --> 01:22:43,260
- I'm done with today's filming.
- Why all of a sudden?

2317
01:22:43,760 --> 01:22:46,050
- He's angry.
- Sung Oh, where are you?

2318
01:22:46,650 --> 01:22:49,690
Gosh, there's a limit.
No one told me what to do.

2319
01:22:49,690 --> 01:22:50,930
Sung Oh.

2320
01:22:50,930 --> 01:22:52,170
- Hello?
- Right away?

2321
01:22:52,170 --> 01:22:55,170
You must be very upset.
I'm the writer of the show.

2322
01:22:55,170 --> 01:22:56,690
I see. Hello.

2323
01:22:56,690 --> 01:22:58,170
(Suddenly acting polite)

2324
01:22:58,170 --> 01:23:01,670
Things have gotten slightly mixed
up here. Who's on your team?

2325
01:23:02,840 --> 01:23:04,180
- My team?
- Yes.

2326
01:23:05,210 --> 01:23:06,510
Jae Hong will know.

2327
01:23:07,300 --> 01:23:08,440
Hold on.

2328
01:23:08,510 --> 01:23:10,140
Jae Hong will know.

2329
01:23:10,770 --> 01:23:11,810
Hello?

2330
01:23:12,010 --> 01:23:14,620
See? Everyone on the show is weird.

2331
01:23:15,390 --> 01:23:18,390
Wait, I see someone.
Hey, Se Chan got off.

2332
01:23:18,390 --> 01:23:19,480
Where?

2333
01:23:20,220 --> 01:23:21,890
Can't you bring my phone?

2334
01:23:22,090 --> 01:23:24,460
I don't even think I'm on his team.

2335
01:23:24,460 --> 01:23:26,670
- Isn't that So Min?
- Right.

2336
01:23:26,670 --> 01:23:28,170
- I can just bring her here, right?
- Yes.

2337
01:23:28,170 --> 01:23:30,090
Hey, So Min! Come over here!

2338
01:23:30,090 --> 01:23:32,300
- Come here. Hi.
- Hello.

2339
01:23:32,300 --> 01:23:33,930
Jong Kook. Hello.

2340
01:23:33,930 --> 01:23:35,180
- You're on my team. Come here.
- I am?

2341
01:23:35,180 --> 01:23:37,800
- No.
- The three of us.

2342
01:23:37,800 --> 01:23:40,550
- Hello.
- I'm on Jae Hong's team.

2343
01:23:40,800 --> 01:23:43,120
We're on the same team.
The three of us.

2344
01:23:43,640 --> 01:23:46,890
So Min. The three of us...

2345
01:23:47,120 --> 01:23:49,050
Hey, Haha is running away
through the trunk.

2346
01:23:49,050 --> 01:23:51,680
- Hey, the trunk won't open.
- Hold on a second.

2347
01:23:51,680 --> 01:23:54,130
- Hey, get in.
- I'm on Jae Hong's team.

2348
01:23:54,130 --> 01:23:56,130
I'm on Jae Hong's team.

2349
01:23:56,590 --> 01:23:58,460
- Hey.
- I'm on Jae Hong's team.

2350
01:23:58,460 --> 01:24:00,190
(Haha manages to escape.)

2351
01:24:00,190 --> 01:24:02,170
- Where's Jae Hong?
- Let's hurry!

2352
01:24:02,170 --> 01:24:03,370
Let's hurry.

2353
01:24:04,260 --> 01:24:06,040
- Haha.
- Right here.

2354
01:24:08,210 --> 01:24:10,180
- Hurry.
- All right.

2355
01:24:10,180 --> 01:24:11,600
(The 3 members of Team Jae Hong
meet after a long chase.)

2356
01:24:12,250 --> 01:24:13,840
- Is this our team?
- Yes.

2357
01:24:13,840 --> 01:24:15,580
- Your team has been formed.
- Hurry.

2358
01:24:15,580 --> 01:24:17,220
- Hurry!
- Yes!

2359
01:24:17,220 --> 01:24:19,010
Get in. Everyone is leaving now!

2360
01:24:19,010 --> 01:24:21,010
- Jae Hong said I was on his team.
- You idiot.

2361
01:24:21,010 --> 01:24:22,390
You idiot.

2362
01:24:23,220 --> 01:24:25,050
- Darn it. Hurry. Sung Oh, come.
- What's going on?

2363
01:24:25,050 --> 01:24:26,330
Wait, he and I aren't
on the same team?

2364
01:24:26,330 --> 01:24:27,590
He totally fooled you.

2365
01:24:27,590 --> 01:24:29,890
Why didn't you answer your phone?

2366
01:24:29,890 --> 01:24:32,520
- He said I was on his team.
- You should've answered your phone.

2367
01:24:32,520 --> 01:24:34,390
- Goodness.
- Listen.

2368
01:24:34,830 --> 01:24:37,170
Just because he said so,
you're on his team?

2369
01:24:37,390 --> 01:24:38,730
He's not the type to lie.

2370
01:24:38,730 --> 01:24:39,900
Ridiculous.

2371
01:24:39,900 --> 01:24:41,930
Your agency
won't pick up their phone.

2372
01:24:41,930 --> 01:24:43,680
Why did you keep calling
the agencies?

2373
01:24:43,680 --> 01:24:46,270
- I don't know your phone numbers.
- If you called them in the morning,

2374
01:24:46,270 --> 01:24:48,840
who would give you our numbers?

2375
01:24:48,840 --> 01:24:50,510
(Which team will win the race?)

2376
01:24:50,810 --> 01:24:52,680
(Humans have one strong instinct.)

2377
01:24:52,680 --> 01:24:54,390
(This instinct always rules over
humans wherever and whenever.)

2378
01:24:54,390 --> 01:24:55,920
(Their instinct to survive)

2379
01:24:56,480 --> 01:24:59,130
(Humans struggle to survive
even in extreme situations.)

2380
01:24:59,830 --> 01:25:01,720
(However,)

2381
01:25:01,720 --> 01:25:04,020
(there's the Grim Reaper
who is jealous of human life.)

2382
01:25:04,020 --> 01:25:07,090
(They cannot find out
its shape, smell, or sound.)

2383
01:25:07,590 --> 01:25:10,090
(They will only hear
people's screams.)

2384
01:25:10,090 --> 01:25:12,400
(At that moment,
a piece of truth is discovered.)

2385
01:25:12,400 --> 01:25:13,470
Hold on. Are you all Grim Reapers?

2386
01:25:13,470 --> 01:25:15,380
(There are more Grim Reapers now.)

2387
01:25:15,710 --> 01:25:16,730
Be careful!

2388
01:25:16,730 --> 01:25:19,710
(The survival mystery thriller
between two worlds in 2020)

2389
01:25:20,600 --> 01:25:21,800
(If they can't get away
from the Grim Reapers,)

2390
01:25:21,800 --> 01:25:23,770
(a tragedy awaits the humans.)

2391
01:25:24,640 --> 01:25:26,720
