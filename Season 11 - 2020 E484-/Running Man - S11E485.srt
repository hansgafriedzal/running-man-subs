1
00:00:05,490 --> 00:00:06,860
(Last week)

2
00:00:07,390 --> 00:00:11,000
(Superstars joined
Running Man last week!)

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:12,130
(Hello, So Min.)

4
00:00:12,130 --> 00:00:13,270
(Happily screaming)

5
00:00:13,730 --> 00:00:15,530
(4 cast members from "Secret Zoo")

6
00:00:15,530 --> 00:00:17,340
(Ahn Jae Hong, Kang Sora,
Jeon Yeo Been, Kim Sung Oh)

7
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:19,240
(The captains must arrive first
with their team members.)

8
00:00:19,240 --> 00:00:21,800
(She's not on his Jae Hong's team.)

9
00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:24,230
(All sorts of scams and tricks
unfolded to obstruct one another.)

10
00:00:24,230 --> 00:00:26,100
(Stealing his phone)

11
00:00:26,100 --> 00:00:28,210
(The two of you are on my team.)

12
00:00:28,210 --> 00:00:30,250
(Come on, don't lie.)

13
00:00:30,250 --> 00:00:32,250
(Hey, let's not do this.)

14
00:00:32,550 --> 00:00:34,690
(At the end of many hardships,)

15
00:00:34,690 --> 00:00:37,360
(they finally formed their teams.)

16
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:41,290
(Which team will arrive first
for the opening segment?)

17
00:00:42,400 --> 00:00:45,190
(The place of their opening segment
is the SBS building in Mok-dong.)

18
00:00:45,230 --> 00:00:49,060
(The first two teams to arrive
will get a benefit for the race.)

19
00:00:49,060 --> 00:00:52,610
(At that time,
the first team arrives.)

20
00:00:54,040 --> 00:00:55,630
- It's Kwang Soo's team.
- Okay.

21
00:00:55,630 --> 00:00:57,700
(Which team arrived first?)

22
00:00:57,700 --> 00:00:58,800
- Be careful.
- Thank you.

23
00:00:58,980 --> 00:01:00,580
- Be careful.
- Goodness.

24
00:01:00,580 --> 00:01:02,150
(The first person to arrive is...)

25
00:01:02,150 --> 00:01:05,620
(Sora.)

26
00:01:06,790 --> 00:01:09,520
(Team Sora
is the 1st one to arrive.)

27
00:01:09,610 --> 00:01:11,220
- We pull out the flag, right?
- All right.

28
00:01:11,220 --> 00:01:12,390
(Team Sora gets a benefit.)

29
00:01:12,390 --> 00:01:14,690
- This does make me happy.
- Okay.

30
00:01:16,030 --> 00:01:17,500
- I see a flag.
- Oh, no.

31
00:01:17,530 --> 00:01:18,590
It's still there.

32
00:01:19,330 --> 00:01:20,530
- Suk Jin.
- Gosh.

33
00:01:20,530 --> 00:01:21,560
(Team Yeo Been
is the 2nd to arrive.)

34
00:01:21,560 --> 00:01:22,670
- Hello.
- Gosh.

35
00:01:23,270 --> 00:01:24,970
- Hello, Yeo Been.
- Hi.

36
00:01:26,230 --> 00:01:28,000
- Hello. Jae Hong.
- Hi.

37
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,280
- They are on your team?
- So Min wasn't on your team.

38
00:01:30,370 --> 00:01:33,250
- My goodness.
- Hello. Hi.

39
00:01:33,250 --> 00:01:35,080
She totally got seduced by Jae Hong.

40
00:01:35,670 --> 00:01:36,870
(So Min definitely was a big help
for Team Jae Hong.)

41
00:01:36,870 --> 00:01:38,050
Didn't I tell you?

42
00:01:38,050 --> 00:01:40,420
You can't trust people
with faces like his.

43
00:01:40,420 --> 00:01:41,520
Come on.

44
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:43,390
You need to get a grip, So Min.

45
00:01:43,450 --> 00:01:44,560
Suk Jin.

46
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:45,890
You're wearing shoes
a prime minister in Joseon wore.

47
00:01:45,890 --> 00:01:48,450
(You're wearing shoes
a prime minister in Joseon wore.)

48
00:01:50,160 --> 00:01:51,530
- Are those UGG boots?
- I thought...

49
00:01:51,530 --> 00:01:52,920
- The UGGs Lim Soo Jung wore?
- I mean,

50
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,620
- Hey, didn't she wear those?
- "I'm Sorry, I Love You".

51
00:01:54,620 --> 00:01:56,670
- That's the ones Soo Jung wore.
- I couldn't believe my eyes.

52
00:01:56,670 --> 00:01:59,030
- I was so surprised.
- The prime minister wears them.

53
00:01:59,030 --> 00:02:01,230
- I thought you were wearing a cast.
- My goodness.

54
00:02:01,230 --> 00:02:04,140
- Why are you wearing those?
- What are you talking about?

55
00:02:04,140 --> 00:02:06,340
- Hey, these are warm.
- The prime ministers wore them.

56
00:02:06,340 --> 00:02:08,080
- Prime minister's shoes?
- All right.

57
00:02:08,810 --> 00:02:10,140
Well, actually,

58
00:02:10,140 --> 00:02:12,050
- because of the morning mission,
- Right.

59
00:02:12,050 --> 00:02:14,980
so we didn't get
to say hello properly.

60
00:02:15,050 --> 00:02:17,050
- They filmed a movie together.
- A film.

61
00:02:17,050 --> 00:02:19,150
- "They Don't Bite".
- It's called...

62
00:02:19,390 --> 00:02:21,130
It's not "They Don't Bite."

63
00:02:21,390 --> 00:02:22,520
- Suk Jin.
- What?

64
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:24,300
If you don't know the title,
just be quiet.

65
00:02:25,630 --> 00:02:26,890
Come on.

66
00:02:27,130 --> 00:02:29,270
- Come on, Prime Minister.
- My apologies.

67
00:02:29,330 --> 00:02:30,670
- It's "Don't Harm Me."
- No.

68
00:02:30,670 --> 00:02:32,010
- It's "Don't Harm Me."
- Seriously.

69
00:02:32,070 --> 00:02:33,110
It's "Secret Zoo."

70
00:02:33,110 --> 00:02:35,540
- This movie takes place at a zoo.
- Right.

71
00:02:35,540 --> 00:02:38,510
- What is this movie about?
- There are no animals at the zoo.

72
00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:41,240
So the zoo is about to close down.

73
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:43,020
And the employees of the zoo
put on costumes...

74
00:02:43,020 --> 00:02:44,450
- and pretend...
- You put on costumes.

75
00:02:44,450 --> 00:02:45,850
- to be animals.
- You become fake animals.

76
00:02:45,850 --> 00:02:47,240
- You'll be fake animals?
- Yes.

77
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:49,020
Do you really think
this is possible?

78
00:02:49,980 --> 00:02:51,610
One of the costumes seems off.

79
00:02:52,630 --> 00:02:55,130
- Let me ask Jae Hong this.
- Okay.

80
00:02:55,130 --> 00:02:58,130
- You have a history with Suk Jin.
- Jae Hong.

81
00:02:58,200 --> 00:03:00,770
- "Candy in My Ears".
- Actually, Jae Hong and I...

82
00:03:00,770 --> 00:03:03,460
talked a lot on the phone
three years ago.

83
00:03:03,460 --> 00:03:05,270
- You were on a TV program, right?
- Yes.

84
00:03:05,270 --> 00:03:08,400
How did you feel after finding out
that Suk Jin was your partner?

85
00:03:08,770 --> 00:03:11,540
The thing is
when the batteries ran out,

86
00:03:11,830 --> 00:03:13,400
- the call ended.
- Right.

87
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:15,010
- That was what the TV show about.
- Right.

88
00:03:15,010 --> 00:03:16,640
When the batteries ran out,
the call ends.

89
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:18,170
So I kept the flashlight on
with the phone.

90
00:03:18,170 --> 00:03:20,580
(So I kept the flashlight on
with the phone.)

91
00:03:20,580 --> 00:03:22,420
(Bursting into laughter)

92
00:03:22,420 --> 00:03:24,390
(I knew it.
The calls ended too quickly.)

93
00:03:24,390 --> 00:03:26,080
- So...
- He wanted the call to end fast.

94
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:27,080
I really liked him.

95
00:03:27,080 --> 00:03:28,730
- So the battery runs out fast.
- That was funny.

96
00:03:28,730 --> 00:03:30,730
(He kept it on
hoping the battery ran out fast.)

97
00:03:30,730 --> 00:03:31,760
That's so funny.

98
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:33,070
Everyone here is entertaining.

99
00:03:33,070 --> 00:03:36,040
- Jae Hong has entertaining stories.
- That's funny.

100
00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:38,730
- You can split your legs?
- He's flexible.

101
00:03:38,730 --> 00:03:40,200
Yes, I can do the splits.

102
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:41,400
- Can you show us?
- I would've never guessed.

103
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:42,610
I can also split legs.

104
00:03:42,610 --> 00:03:43,930
- Someone else's legs.
- Right.

105
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:46,140
- That's your area of expertise.
- He won't stop there.

106
00:03:46,140 --> 00:03:47,200
- He'll split everything.
- Everything.

107
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:48,850
- Why would you do that?
- I mean,

108
00:03:48,850 --> 00:03:50,020
- I was just saying.
- Well, for legs...

109
00:03:50,170 --> 00:03:52,080
- Can you show us?
- The leg split?

110
00:03:52,420 --> 00:03:54,140
If you can't, he'll help you.

111
00:03:54,610 --> 00:03:56,760
- The side split or the front split?
- Either one is fine.

112
00:03:56,760 --> 00:03:57,890
He can do the front and back.

113
00:03:57,890 --> 00:03:59,130
- The front split might be better.
- The front split.

114
00:03:59,130 --> 00:04:01,990
- The side split is harder.
- The side split is really hard.

115
00:04:01,990 --> 00:04:03,450
- I'll do the side split.
- Yes.

116
00:04:03,450 --> 00:04:04,450
- Really?
- You can really do that?

117
00:04:04,450 --> 00:04:05,460
- That's the hard one.
- You can do it?

118
00:04:05,460 --> 00:04:06,990
- You can do it in those pants?
- Don't overdo yourself.

119
00:04:06,990 --> 00:04:08,170
- I'll go easy on myself.
- Okay.

120
00:04:08,170 --> 00:04:09,640
- It's hard in those pants.
- Wait.

121
00:04:09,640 --> 00:04:10,890
- It's hard in the morning.
- Do the front split.

122
00:04:10,890 --> 00:04:12,070
- The front split?
- Yes.

123
00:04:12,070 --> 00:04:13,570
I don't care which one.
Can't you just do it?

124
00:04:13,570 --> 00:04:16,380
(I don't care which one.
Can't you just do it?)

125
00:04:16,580 --> 00:04:18,380
(Struggling)

126
00:04:18,380 --> 00:04:19,550
I don't think he can do it.

127
00:04:19,700 --> 00:04:22,180
(Screaming)

128
00:04:23,540 --> 00:04:25,450
(Wide leg split)

129
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:29,190
(Surprised)

130
00:04:29,410 --> 00:04:30,690
Gosh, he can do it.

131
00:04:30,990 --> 00:04:33,350
- I didn't think he could.
- He's really good.

132
00:04:33,350 --> 00:04:34,760
- Doesn't that hurt?
- Yes, I'm fine.

133
00:04:34,760 --> 00:04:36,130
- Are those your legs?
- By the way,

134
00:04:36,130 --> 00:04:38,020
- Hung Kam Bo was really flexible.
- Right.

135
00:04:38,020 --> 00:04:39,430
- Why did you bring him up now?
- Why would you say that now?

136
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:42,590
(Suddenly mentioning Hung Kam Bo)

137
00:04:42,590 --> 00:04:43,790
- Why would you say that now?
- Listen.

138
00:04:43,790 --> 00:04:45,510
- Why are we talking about him?
- All of a sudden?

139
00:04:45,510 --> 00:04:47,030
I'm saying that
some people are flexible...

140
00:04:47,030 --> 00:04:48,530
- although they don't look flexible.
- Right.

141
00:04:48,530 --> 00:04:50,880
Other people can do the splits.
Why did you bring him up?

142
00:04:51,100 --> 00:04:52,340
That's amazing.

143
00:04:52,340 --> 00:04:53,450
(After Jae Hong
who showed off his flexibility...)

144
00:04:53,450 --> 00:04:55,340
- And Sora is here today.
- All right.

145
00:04:56,040 --> 00:04:58,470
- Pine trees, green pine trees.
- All right.

146
00:04:58,910 --> 00:05:01,190
Sora, how was it today?
You briefly did a mission.

147
00:05:01,190 --> 00:05:03,760
It was brief, but you said
something was shocking.

148
00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:05,350
The betrayals among the members.

149
00:05:05,350 --> 00:05:08,580
(She sounds cheerful.)

150
00:05:09,350 --> 00:05:10,760
- She...
- That was shocking?

151
00:05:10,830 --> 00:05:12,870
- She was so shocked in the car.
- She couldn't do it.

152
00:05:12,870 --> 00:05:14,720
(It was really shocking.)

153
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:15,940
By the way, Sora...

154
00:05:15,940 --> 00:05:19,140
- is famous for her selfies.
- She takes a lot? She likes it?

155
00:05:19,140 --> 00:05:20,960
Her fans have a nickname for it.

156
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:23,240
- Selfie Fool.
- SF.

157
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:24,970
Gosh, here it is. There.

158
00:05:24,970 --> 00:05:26,750
- That kind of selfie...
- Did you take that photo?

159
00:05:26,750 --> 00:05:28,640
- That...
- Did someone take it for you?

160
00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:31,120
People take that kind of photos
for advertisements.

161
00:05:31,250 --> 00:05:32,840
People don't usually use
these photos.

162
00:05:32,990 --> 00:05:34,750
- You took them and uploaded them?
- Is this how you take photos?

163
00:05:34,750 --> 00:05:37,520
- Yes, I posted it a long time ago.
- You posted it online?

164
00:05:37,950 --> 00:05:39,630
- She's good now.
- Well, that's not too bad.

165
00:05:39,630 --> 00:05:41,850
- I'm good at taking selfies now.
- You took them recently.

166
00:05:41,850 --> 00:05:43,020
She can take these photos now.

167
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:45,350
Now, we have Kim Sung Oh.

168
00:05:45,350 --> 00:05:47,700
In a way, people are reminded...

169
00:05:47,700 --> 00:05:49,830
- of his intense villain roles.
- "The Man from Nowhere".

170
00:05:49,830 --> 00:05:52,000
He showed us a lot
of intense performances.

171
00:05:52,100 --> 00:05:53,960
- You kidnapped Ji Hyo a while back.
- Yes.

172
00:05:53,960 --> 00:05:56,270
(He kidnapped Ji Hyo
a long time ago.)

173
00:05:56,700 --> 00:05:58,750
- You kidnapped Ji Hyo a while back.
- Yes.

174
00:05:58,750 --> 00:06:00,750
- He did that in a movie.
- What? In a movie?

175
00:06:00,810 --> 00:06:03,120
- You scared me.
- You should mention that first...

176
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:04,520
- and say that next.
- I thought he did it in real life.

177
00:06:04,520 --> 00:06:05,710
- Come on, be clear.
- No.

178
00:06:05,710 --> 00:06:07,390
- I should've mentioned that first.
- You can't say it like that.

179
00:06:07,390 --> 00:06:08,950
- He did that in a movie.
- But...

180
00:06:09,020 --> 00:06:11,650
By the way, what kind of person
is Ji Hyo in your opinion?

181
00:06:11,650 --> 00:06:12,780
She's the best.

182
00:06:12,830 --> 00:06:14,560
- In what ways?
- What?

183
00:06:15,220 --> 00:06:16,590
We want to know too.

184
00:06:16,890 --> 00:06:18,350
Why is she the best? Why?

185
00:06:18,350 --> 00:06:20,330
Can you tell us in what ways
she's the best?

186
00:06:20,330 --> 00:06:21,890
I said it because we're on TV.

187
00:06:21,890 --> 00:06:24,830
(I said it because we're on TV.)

188
00:06:24,830 --> 00:06:28,100
If you think what I say on TV
is valid in real life,

189
00:06:28,100 --> 00:06:29,810
I can't be on TV then.

190
00:06:29,900 --> 00:06:31,330
Should I be myself then?

191
00:06:31,330 --> 00:06:32,600
- He has a lot of anger inside him.
- Listen.

192
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:35,040
- You need to be yourself on TV.
- He's angry.

193
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:37,380
You need to give me
some breathing room.

194
00:06:37,380 --> 00:06:39,450
- You can't corner me like that.
- Listen.

195
00:06:39,450 --> 00:06:40,950
- What did I do wrong?
- Why would you say that?

196
00:06:41,690 --> 00:06:43,060
- I can ask him a question.
- Right.

197
00:06:43,060 --> 00:06:44,450
Yes. You're not supposed
to ask that.

198
00:06:44,450 --> 00:06:46,130
- He's making stuff up.
- You know...

199
00:06:46,130 --> 00:06:47,990
- I can't say only nice things.
- That's not it.

200
00:06:47,990 --> 00:06:50,290
In your movie, "Secret Zoo,"

201
00:06:50,290 --> 00:06:51,390
which animal are you?

202
00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:52,700
I'm a gorilla.

203
00:06:52,700 --> 00:06:55,590
- I can see the gorilla inside him.
- It suits him.

204
00:06:55,590 --> 00:06:57,090
- What about you, Yeo Been?
- I'm a sloth.

205
00:06:57,090 --> 00:06:58,740
- It suits her.
- I can see it.

206
00:06:58,740 --> 00:07:01,140
- It suits you.
- You do resemble a sloth.

207
00:07:01,140 --> 00:07:02,770
- Did you put on makeup for that?
- Your face...

208
00:07:03,380 --> 00:07:05,180
- The director did a great job.
- Me?

209
00:07:05,180 --> 00:07:06,680
- He cast the right people.
- He did an awesome job.

210
00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:08,310
You can totally be the sloth.

211
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:10,450
You've never seen a sloth in person.

212
00:07:10,450 --> 00:07:12,080
- No.
- We're looking at one now.

213
00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:14,390
- I've never seen it in person.
- We're looking at one now.

214
00:07:14,390 --> 00:07:16,350
- We're looking at it now.
- When I see you,

215
00:07:16,350 --> 00:07:17,890
- I can totally picture it.
- You totally fit the role.

216
00:07:17,890 --> 00:07:19,560
- He cast the right person.
- He did a great job.

217
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:21,690
- She reminds me of a sloth.
- That's amazing.

218
00:07:21,690 --> 00:07:24,720
Today's race is called Reincarnated:
We Won't Harm You.

219
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:27,790
Among you, two members
who were eliminated...

220
00:07:27,790 --> 00:07:29,460
- Again?
- There's another twist?

221
00:07:29,460 --> 00:07:31,390
- There are spies again?
- Gosh, this is crazy.

222
00:07:31,390 --> 00:07:32,510
- Gosh.
- Come on.

223
00:07:32,510 --> 00:07:34,900
Among you, two members
who were eliminated are back...

224
00:07:34,900 --> 00:07:36,400
by reincarnation.

225
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:39,380
And two deities of death
are trying to catch them.

226
00:07:39,510 --> 00:07:42,040
I think Sung Oh
probably got reincarnated.

227
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:43,250
- You got a mission, didn't you?
- Yes.

228
00:07:43,250 --> 00:07:44,910
- He came here early today.
- My gosh.

229
00:07:44,910 --> 00:07:46,540
- It's obvious he's the deity.
- Gosh. Look at his face.

230
00:07:46,540 --> 00:07:47,690
I get it now.

231
00:07:47,690 --> 00:07:49,390
- He's the deity of death.
- I know what to do now.

232
00:07:50,210 --> 00:07:51,350
Okay.

233
00:07:51,580 --> 00:07:53,190
There will be three rounds
in the mission.

234
00:07:53,190 --> 00:07:55,790
If even 1 of the 2 reincarnated
members survives,

235
00:07:55,790 --> 00:07:56,890
they will win.

236
00:07:57,020 --> 00:07:59,770
And if both members are eliminated,
the deities of death will win.

237
00:07:59,770 --> 00:08:02,390
- The losers get the water bomb.
- The water bomb?

238
00:08:02,390 --> 00:08:04,200
- Yes.
- It's really cold today.

239
00:08:04,270 --> 00:08:07,070
The deities can eliminate members
by ripping off their name tags.

240
00:08:07,070 --> 00:08:09,970
Only the deities will have
10 minutes to remove...

241
00:08:10,530 --> 00:08:13,380
the name tags after each mission
when the light is turned on.

242
00:08:13,470 --> 00:08:15,640
If the reincarnated members
aren't eliminated,

243
00:08:15,640 --> 00:08:18,340
the staff members will draw
two balls randomly after each round,

244
00:08:18,340 --> 00:08:20,450
and the chosen members
will join the deities.

245
00:08:20,450 --> 00:08:22,890
(The chosen members
will join the deities.)

246
00:08:23,060 --> 00:08:26,130
And the deities will be informed
about the members on their team.

247
00:08:26,280 --> 00:08:28,020
That can't happen.
There can't be more deities.

248
00:08:28,020 --> 00:08:29,350
- Are you the deity of death?
- Why not?

249
00:08:29,390 --> 00:08:30,650
Why can't that happen?

250
00:08:30,650 --> 00:08:32,220
- If I was, I wouldn't say that.
- Right.

251
00:08:32,220 --> 00:08:33,890
- He'd be the reincarnated member.
- The reincarnated member.

252
00:08:33,890 --> 00:08:35,330
- Suk Jin, you should focus.
- You reincarnated, didn't you?

253
00:08:35,330 --> 00:08:36,590
He whispered this to me.

254
00:08:36,740 --> 00:08:37,970
"I don't get it."

255
00:08:37,970 --> 00:08:40,030
(Suk Jin says, "I don't get it.")

256
00:08:40,030 --> 00:08:42,060
(He wants to be sharp,
but he can't understand the rules.)

257
00:08:42,060 --> 00:08:45,270
So the members who weren't chosen
as the deities of death...

258
00:08:45,270 --> 00:08:46,640
will be on the reincarnated
members' team.

259
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:49,020
If they are eliminated,
they'll face the penalty together.

260
00:08:49,020 --> 00:08:51,440
Protecting them to survive
in the race will be important.

261
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:53,490
I'll draw two members
for the deities of death.

262
00:08:53,490 --> 00:08:55,090
- You'll draw them?
- I see.

263
00:08:55,090 --> 00:08:57,780
- So no one was informed?
- The first two will be chosen now.

264
00:08:58,050 --> 00:09:00,230
The first two deities of death
will be chosen now.

265
00:09:00,230 --> 00:09:02,960
(2 deities of death
have been chosen.)

266
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:04,550
We're done with the draw.

267
00:09:04,550 --> 00:09:06,600
- Did you send the text messages?
- Yes. I did.

268
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:08,020
(The chosen deities of death
will receive a text message.)

269
00:09:08,270 --> 00:09:11,530
The deities of death must go after
the reincarnated members.

270
00:09:11,660 --> 00:09:14,030
First, I'll give out the advantage
to the two winning teams.

271
00:09:14,030 --> 00:09:15,110
- Okay.
- It's an advantage.

272
00:09:15,110 --> 00:09:17,070
You can put it
on any member of your choice.

273
00:09:17,070 --> 00:09:18,110
It's the penalty badge.

274
00:09:18,110 --> 00:09:19,670
If we get a lot of penalty badges...

275
00:09:19,670 --> 00:09:21,380
If you have a lot of the badges,
regardless of the outcome,

276
00:09:21,380 --> 00:09:22,850
you'll get the stick as the penalty.

277
00:09:22,850 --> 00:09:24,440
Whom should we give this to?

278
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:25,850
- Kwang Soo.
- What?

279
00:09:25,850 --> 00:09:27,140
I see. Someone on our team?

280
00:09:27,410 --> 00:09:29,280
- No.
- So we'll discuss who'll get it?

281
00:09:29,550 --> 00:09:30,890
- Our team has to choose one?
- For a second...

282
00:09:30,890 --> 00:09:33,050
- They are on the same team.
- Were you trying to give it to me?

283
00:09:33,050 --> 00:09:34,650
(Were you trying to give it to me?)

284
00:09:34,650 --> 00:09:35,730
(Kicking)

285
00:09:35,730 --> 00:09:38,260
Jae Suk and Kwang Soo
are on the same team.

286
00:09:38,260 --> 00:09:39,890
- He tried to give it to Kwang Soo.
- You tried to give that to me?

287
00:09:39,890 --> 00:09:41,100
- Kwang Soo.
- What's happening?

288
00:09:41,100 --> 00:09:42,690
You have no faith in me.

289
00:09:42,790 --> 00:09:45,370
- He really kicked you.
- Right?

290
00:09:45,370 --> 00:09:46,870
(He really kicked you.)

291
00:09:46,870 --> 00:09:48,010
(Culture shock)

292
00:09:48,010 --> 00:09:49,030
He really kicked Jae Suk.

293
00:09:49,030 --> 00:09:51,840
- Of course. We don't fake it.
- Right.

294
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:53,540
- Jae Hong, this is real.
- We don't fake it.

295
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:55,210
- We should discuss to pick someone.
- Today...

296
00:09:55,270 --> 00:09:56,910
- You should pick someone.
- Yes.

297
00:09:56,910 --> 00:09:58,220
No, don't make me do it.

298
00:09:58,270 --> 00:09:59,390
Why not? It's all right.

299
00:09:59,520 --> 00:10:00,810
Should we vote? Should we all vote?

300
00:10:00,810 --> 00:10:02,390
Since he looks the healthiest,
we should pick Jong Kook.

301
00:10:02,520 --> 00:10:03,650
Jong Kook?

302
00:10:04,590 --> 00:10:06,130
- Is that a dangerous move?
- It's okay.

303
00:10:06,130 --> 00:10:07,680
- Just now,
- What?

304
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:09,890
you've been chosen by Sora.

305
00:10:10,050 --> 00:10:11,190
- Me?
- Yes.

306
00:10:11,290 --> 00:10:13,560
- We've never met. Why me?
- Right.

307
00:10:13,730 --> 00:10:15,630
I mean... Have we met?

308
00:10:15,740 --> 00:10:17,500
- You don't know me.
- No, listen.

309
00:10:17,500 --> 00:10:19,710
- Jong Kook. He hates...
- We've never met before.

310
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:21,430
- this the most.
- Right.

311
00:10:21,430 --> 00:10:23,510
- There's no probable cause.
- Did I offend her in any way?

312
00:10:23,510 --> 00:10:24,670
She said you looked healthy.

313
00:10:24,670 --> 00:10:26,380
- Yes, she has a point.
- Yes.

314
00:10:26,570 --> 00:10:28,380
Just give it to anyone you want,
Actress Jeon.

315
00:10:28,380 --> 00:10:29,380
(It's time for her
to give out the badge.)

316
00:10:29,380 --> 00:10:31,540
- At least, you met her before.
- Relax. There's no pressure.

317
00:10:32,020 --> 00:10:33,120
You won't listen to me.

318
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:34,540
(Surprised)

319
00:10:34,940 --> 00:10:36,090
You won't listen to me.

320
00:10:36,180 --> 00:10:37,620
(Jong Kook gets 2 penalty badges.)

321
00:10:37,620 --> 00:10:39,180
- What's happening?
- That was bold.

322
00:10:39,180 --> 00:10:40,490
What just happened?

323
00:10:40,680 --> 00:10:42,360
- Me?
- She's trying to undermine him.

324
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:43,630
We've never met before.

325
00:10:43,630 --> 00:10:44,760
Giving you the stick is better...

326
00:10:44,760 --> 00:10:45,890
- than getting one from you.
- Me?

327
00:10:46,730 --> 00:10:48,970
I won't watch your movie
even through VOD.

328
00:10:48,970 --> 00:10:52,400
(He says something shocking.)

329
00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:53,510
Come on.

330
00:10:53,970 --> 00:10:55,430
You didn't have to say that.

331
00:10:55,430 --> 00:10:57,030
What is this?

332
00:10:57,030 --> 00:10:59,250
She suddenly gave it to me.

333
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:01,250
- What is this?
- How shocking.

334
00:11:01,250 --> 00:11:02,980
- What is this?
- Change your outfits,

335
00:11:02,980 --> 00:11:05,070
and let's get started.

336
00:11:05,070 --> 00:11:06,350
(The race starts.)

337
00:11:06,350 --> 00:11:07,540
- Let's go.
- All right.

338
00:11:07,540 --> 00:11:10,410
You'll be given a hint regarding
those who have been reborn.

339
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:12,220
Okay.

340
00:11:12,220 --> 00:11:13,820
For this first mission,
all of you need to succeed.

341
00:11:13,820 --> 00:11:15,280
It's called Rodeo and Juliet.

342
00:11:15,280 --> 00:11:17,100
- Rodeo and Juliet?
- Rodeo and Juliet?

343
00:11:17,100 --> 00:11:18,320
The teams will take turns.

344
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:21,100
If you don't pass 3 out of 5 rounds,

345
00:11:21,290 --> 00:11:23,340
the hint will be revealed.

346
00:11:23,870 --> 00:11:26,510
The deities of death
will try to fail intentionally.

347
00:11:26,510 --> 00:11:27,510
That's right.

348
00:11:27,510 --> 00:11:30,010
One of you will get on the horse
and try to hold out.

349
00:11:30,010 --> 00:11:31,270
One of the other members...

350
00:11:31,270 --> 00:11:34,170
must eat jjajangmyeon
or do the water bottle flip...

351
00:11:34,170 --> 00:11:36,070
in the amount of time the person
lasted on the horse to pass.

352
00:11:36,980 --> 00:11:39,040
- Flip a water bottle?
- Yes, you flip it upright.

353
00:11:39,620 --> 00:11:41,280
- Let's have jjajangmyeon.
- Okay.

354
00:11:41,850 --> 00:11:43,220
(They decide to have jjajangmyeon.)

355
00:11:43,220 --> 00:11:44,280
(They're excited.)

356
00:11:44,280 --> 00:11:45,720
Haha, let's work.

357
00:11:46,490 --> 00:11:47,490
- What?
- Don't goof around.

358
00:11:47,490 --> 00:11:48,780
He wants you to stop goofing around
and work.

359
00:11:48,780 --> 00:11:51,050
- I am. What's wrong with him?
- Did you hear him?

360
00:11:51,050 --> 00:11:52,690
(He's sullen.)

361
00:11:52,690 --> 00:11:53,730
(Se Chan is a tattletale.)

362
00:11:53,730 --> 00:11:55,320
He said,
"I am. What's wrong with him?"

363
00:11:55,320 --> 00:11:56,770
That's what he said.

364
00:11:57,100 --> 00:11:58,660
He said that. Right?

365
00:11:58,660 --> 00:11:59,870
- I'm just reacting.
- Right.

366
00:11:59,870 --> 00:12:01,110
You're working.

367
00:12:01,770 --> 00:12:03,510
Okay. I got it.

368
00:12:03,530 --> 00:12:05,380
Take your hands out of your pockets
when working.

369
00:12:05,380 --> 00:12:06,440
(He retaliates.)

370
00:12:06,440 --> 00:12:08,170
- Work, will you?
- What?

371
00:12:08,170 --> 00:12:10,250
- Be sincere.
- Okay.

372
00:12:12,250 --> 00:12:14,440
- Let me fix your clothes.
- You should wear this.

373
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:16,410
You should wear this
and give that to me.

374
00:12:16,410 --> 00:12:18,650
- They're the same size.
- Yeo Been.

375
00:12:18,650 --> 00:12:19,960
I know you haven't
gotten to know him yet,

376
00:12:19,960 --> 00:12:22,050
but what do you think
about Suk Jin?

377
00:12:22,650 --> 00:12:25,050
He promised to make me into a star.

378
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:27,520
- Why would you promise her that?
- I told her so.

379
00:12:27,520 --> 00:12:29,190
- I did.
- What's wrong with him?

380
00:12:29,190 --> 00:12:31,370
I am the star-maker of this show.

381
00:12:31,370 --> 00:12:34,270
- Why would you promise her that?
- Look.

382
00:12:34,270 --> 00:12:35,370
I know she's already famous,

383
00:12:35,370 --> 00:12:39,250
I'm going to make her name
the most-searched word online.

384
00:12:39,250 --> 00:12:41,640
- Which team will go first?
- Let's see.

385
00:12:41,640 --> 00:12:43,440
Let's play a Race of Wits.

386
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:45,540
- The 1st person to...
- 1!

387
00:12:46,350 --> 00:12:47,540
- The 1st person to...
- 1!

388
00:12:47,540 --> 00:12:48,590
(The staff didn't say go.)

389
00:12:48,590 --> 00:12:49,760
You need to sit down.

390
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:51,490
She plays so dirty.

391
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:53,420
- She's so reckless.
- Two!

392
00:12:53,420 --> 00:12:54,630
- Hold on.
- We haven't started yet.

393
00:12:54,630 --> 00:12:56,320
(She says 2.)

394
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:58,650
- What's wrong with them?
- What's wrong with them?

395
00:12:58,650 --> 00:13:01,320
- They do whatever they want!
- What's wrong with them?

396
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:04,770
Like I said, Sora is
very straightforward.

397
00:13:04,770 --> 00:13:06,240
- She's very determined.
- She's reckless.

398
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:08,710
- She only does what she's told.
- She just wants to win.

399
00:13:08,710 --> 00:13:10,510
- Whoever loses...
- Goes first?

400
00:13:10,510 --> 00:13:11,980
- Yes.
- Okay.

401
00:13:11,980 --> 00:13:13,270
If we don't do anything, we'll win.

402
00:13:14,300 --> 00:13:15,440
I'm sure.

403
00:13:15,750 --> 00:13:17,120
Get ready, set, go.

404
00:13:17,170 --> 00:13:18,380
One.

405
00:13:18,380 --> 00:13:19,410
Two.

406
00:13:19,940 --> 00:13:20,940
Three.

407
00:13:22,180 --> 00:13:23,280
Four.

408
00:13:24,020 --> 00:13:25,050
- 5.
- 6.

409
00:13:25,260 --> 00:13:26,590
Okay.

410
00:13:27,050 --> 00:13:29,690
(Sung Oh and Suk Jin are out.)

411
00:13:29,690 --> 00:13:32,020
- Rock-paper-scissors.
- You should've waited.

412
00:13:32,020 --> 00:13:33,790
- Sung Oh, do better.
- He's being scolded.

413
00:13:33,790 --> 00:13:35,630
- Let's go!
- We overlapped.

414
00:13:35,630 --> 00:13:37,100
We overlapped.

415
00:13:37,100 --> 00:13:38,530
You told us to wait.

416
00:13:38,530 --> 00:13:40,640
- You said we should be quiet.
- What have you done?

417
00:13:40,640 --> 00:13:41,970
- What have you done?
- What?

418
00:13:41,970 --> 00:13:45,430
You told us not to do anything,
but you did instead.

419
00:13:45,430 --> 00:13:46,480
He got too excited.

420
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:47,510
That's what this show is all about.

421
00:13:47,510 --> 00:13:48,710
- Rock-paper-scissors.
- Okay.

422
00:13:49,810 --> 00:13:51,570
- Let's do it. Come here.
- Okay.

423
00:13:51,570 --> 00:13:52,990
- Good luck.
- Kwang Soo, come here.

424
00:13:52,990 --> 00:13:54,090
- Good luck.
- Good luck.

425
00:13:54,090 --> 00:13:56,090
I bet he'll be good.

426
00:13:56,090 --> 00:13:57,910
You look quite stable.

427
00:13:57,910 --> 00:14:01,020
There's a 75-percent chance
he's a deity of death.

428
00:14:01,390 --> 00:14:02,920
I can see the words next to him.

429
00:14:02,920 --> 00:14:04,360
He's not that talkative anymore.

430
00:14:04,360 --> 00:14:05,690
Doesn't he need a helmet?

431
00:14:05,690 --> 00:14:07,270
- Helmet?
- Yes, let's give him one.

432
00:14:07,270 --> 00:14:08,370
He should wear one.

433
00:14:08,370 --> 00:14:09,430
Is it that intense?

434
00:14:09,430 --> 00:14:11,160
- If you hold out for too long...
- It's cold.

435
00:14:11,160 --> 00:14:12,840
Don't use both hands.

436
00:14:12,840 --> 00:14:14,140
Jae Suk!

437
00:14:14,140 --> 00:14:15,370
Don't use both hands.

438
00:14:15,370 --> 00:14:16,840
(Jae Suk slips and falls.)

439
00:14:17,240 --> 00:14:18,510
Don't use both hands.

440
00:14:18,510 --> 00:14:19,670
Jae Suk!

441
00:14:19,670 --> 00:14:21,510
- What's wrong with him?
- What's wrong with him?

442
00:14:21,510 --> 00:14:24,070
(The others fall as well.)

443
00:14:24,670 --> 00:14:25,940
- What's wrong with you?
- Come on.

444
00:14:25,940 --> 00:14:27,620
What's wrong with you?

445
00:14:27,620 --> 00:14:28,990
- You almost got hurt.
- Why did this move?

446
00:14:28,990 --> 00:14:30,490
It is quite slippery.

447
00:14:30,490 --> 00:14:33,150
- You almost got injured.
- Why is this slippery?

448
00:14:33,150 --> 00:14:36,260
- You try to be so funny.
- He tries to be so funny.

449
00:14:36,260 --> 00:14:38,390
- I can't believe you.
- Why was that slippery?

450
00:14:38,390 --> 00:14:40,920
- Be careful, will you?
- Did you get that?

451
00:14:42,390 --> 00:14:43,840
- They got it.
- What?

452
00:14:43,840 --> 00:14:45,290
Don't act like it was intentional.

453
00:14:45,370 --> 00:14:47,370
- They got it.
- You got it, right?

454
00:14:47,870 --> 00:14:50,570
- It's slapstick.
- He acts like everything's planned.

455
00:14:50,570 --> 00:14:52,380
- "That's a highlight."
- All right.

456
00:14:52,610 --> 00:14:54,670
- We'll start the timer now.
- I have a good feeling about this.

457
00:14:54,670 --> 00:14:56,620
- Me too.
- Get ready, set, go.

458
00:14:56,670 --> 00:14:57,910
Hang in there.

459
00:14:58,270 --> 00:14:59,590
That's quick.

460
00:14:59,590 --> 00:15:00,810
Look at the angles.

461
00:15:00,810 --> 00:15:02,960
- Look at his gaze.
- You shouldn't be stiff.

462
00:15:02,960 --> 00:15:04,310
- Your body needs to be...
- It needs to be flexible.

463
00:15:04,310 --> 00:15:06,490
Good. Great job.

464
00:15:07,630 --> 00:15:09,320
He looks so sexy.

465
00:15:09,320 --> 00:15:10,520
Good.

466
00:15:10,520 --> 00:15:12,000
(He looks seductive.)

467
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,420
You're looking sexy!

468
00:15:13,420 --> 00:15:14,630
You're doing well.

469
00:15:14,630 --> 00:15:17,030
- He's good.
- He is.

470
00:15:17,030 --> 00:15:18,500
Why does he look so sexy?

471
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:19,930
He looks sexy.

472
00:15:19,930 --> 00:15:21,370
Good. Nice hips.

473
00:15:21,370 --> 00:15:23,430
What if this doesn't get aired?

474
00:15:23,900 --> 00:15:24,980
That's okay.

475
00:15:24,980 --> 00:15:26,350
You're doing well.

476
00:15:26,440 --> 00:15:28,400
- You're doing well.
- You are.

477
00:15:28,400 --> 00:15:30,220
(He clenches his teeth.)

478
00:15:30,220 --> 00:15:32,310
- He's hanging on.
- He is.

479
00:15:32,310 --> 00:15:34,640
I think they could finish
a bowl of jjajangmyeon.

480
00:15:34,640 --> 00:15:36,390
He may make it look easy,
but that's not the case.

481
00:15:36,390 --> 00:15:37,990
- It's really hard.
- He's the best one I've seen.

482
00:15:38,620 --> 00:15:39,760
You're doing well.

483
00:15:39,760 --> 00:15:41,020
You're doing a great job.

484
00:15:41,020 --> 00:15:42,180
- You're doing well.
- What is this?

485
00:15:42,180 --> 00:15:44,190
If he's going to take this long,
let us stop by at home.

486
00:15:44,760 --> 00:15:46,600
(At that moment...)

487
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:47,920
He's really good.

488
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:49,290
(He falls.)

489
00:15:49,290 --> 00:15:50,370
- Okay, okay.
- Are you okay?

490
00:15:50,370 --> 00:15:52,470
How many seconds?
Or were they minutes?

491
00:15:52,470 --> 00:15:53,870
1 minute and 40 seconds.

492
00:15:54,970 --> 00:15:56,900
(This sexy man breathes heavily.)

493
00:15:56,900 --> 00:15:59,070
He's obviously not a deity of death.

494
00:15:59,170 --> 00:16:00,510
You're right.

495
00:16:00,510 --> 00:16:03,670
It didn't matter whether I was
reincarnated or a deity.

496
00:16:03,880 --> 00:16:05,770
- I just wanted to ride it well.
- Exactly.

497
00:16:05,770 --> 00:16:07,120
I watched rodeos often.

498
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:09,040
- You did well.
- Every time I saw it on TV,

499
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:11,490
- You wanted to try it?
- I felt like I could ride it well.

500
00:16:11,490 --> 00:16:13,280
- He's flexible.
- He is.

501
00:16:13,280 --> 00:16:14,280
He's good.

502
00:16:14,280 --> 00:16:16,150
So Min and Jong Kook,

503
00:16:16,150 --> 00:16:18,500
please decide whether
to do the water bottle flip...

504
00:16:18,500 --> 00:16:20,820
or eat jjajangmyeon
in the given time.

505
00:16:20,820 --> 00:16:22,970
They could do both
in that given time.

506
00:16:22,970 --> 00:16:25,840
You could have jjajangmyeon
and jjamppong.

507
00:16:25,840 --> 00:16:28,430
- Please make your decision.
- We choose jjajangmyeon.

508
00:16:28,530 --> 00:16:30,480
You have 1 minute and 40 seconds.

509
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:32,400
- You can have fried dumplings too.
- This is...

510
00:16:32,400 --> 00:16:34,170
- This is too easy.
- You could order them right now.

511
00:16:34,170 --> 00:16:36,750
- You can stop by at home too.
- You may begin once I tell you to.

512
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:39,170
- Will you eat?
- So Min will eat?

513
00:16:39,170 --> 00:16:40,720
- Yes.
- I doubt...

514
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:42,440
she will finish it.
I really doubt it.

515
00:16:42,440 --> 00:16:43,720
I have a small mouth.

516
00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:44,960
(The countdown begins.)

517
00:16:48,820 --> 00:16:51,050
You shouldn't eat it like that.

518
00:16:51,050 --> 00:16:53,060
She can't do it. She can't.

519
00:16:53,060 --> 00:16:55,230
(While everyone is talking down
to her,)

520
00:16:55,230 --> 00:16:58,270
(a man comes to hold her hair.)

521
00:16:58,270 --> 00:17:00,470
(It's Se Chan.)

522
00:17:00,740 --> 00:17:01,740
(Oh, my.)

523
00:17:01,740 --> 00:17:03,430
(He looks nonchalant.)

524
00:17:03,430 --> 00:17:06,210
(He approaches her without warning.)

525
00:17:06,210 --> 00:17:07,670
Work, will you?

526
00:17:08,250 --> 00:17:09,480
(She focuses on eating once again.)

527
00:17:09,480 --> 00:17:10,750
I don't think she can do it.

528
00:17:10,750 --> 00:17:12,570
- She won't be able to finish it.
- She can't.

529
00:17:12,570 --> 00:17:14,340
She won't finish it.

530
00:17:14,340 --> 00:17:15,650
She only has a minute
and 40 seconds.

531
00:17:15,650 --> 00:17:17,280
It's too much.

532
00:17:17,990 --> 00:17:20,230
She needs to do it again.

533
00:17:20,230 --> 00:17:23,000
They didn't give her pickled radish.
She needs to eat that.

534
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,590
Why can't she finish it?

535
00:17:24,590 --> 00:17:26,430
She's not even having
double servings.

536
00:17:26,700 --> 00:17:28,670
I could finish jjamppong
and jjajangmyeon.

537
00:17:28,670 --> 00:17:30,290
- She's a deity of death.
- I think she's a deity of death.

538
00:17:30,290 --> 00:17:32,000
Yes, it feels like it.
She's really eating slowly.

539
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,330
I agree.

540
00:17:33,330 --> 00:17:35,910
A minute and 40 seconds
is a long time.

541
00:17:35,910 --> 00:17:37,530
I'm really doing my best.

542
00:17:37,680 --> 00:17:39,070
- Five,
- She can't finish this?

543
00:17:39,070 --> 00:17:40,100
- four,
- She's so suspicious.

544
00:17:40,100 --> 00:17:41,370
- three,
- I could've eaten...

545
00:17:41,370 --> 00:17:42,450
- two,
- another dish.

546
00:17:42,450 --> 00:17:43,520
- one.
- I'm serious.

547
00:17:43,650 --> 00:17:44,680
- She failed.
- You've failed.

548
00:17:44,680 --> 00:17:46,020
She's not giving it her best.

549
00:17:46,020 --> 00:17:48,750
You should've told me in advance
if you were going to eat like this.

550
00:17:48,750 --> 00:17:51,460
It's because she didn't have
any pickled radish.

551
00:17:51,460 --> 00:17:53,380
This is way too much.

552
00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:55,660
Is anyone confident...

553
00:17:55,660 --> 00:17:58,200
- to do better than Sung Oh?
- I know, right?

554
00:17:58,200 --> 00:17:59,260
I think I can.

555
00:17:59,260 --> 00:18:00,700
- Jae Hong wants to try.
- Go on.

556
00:18:00,700 --> 00:18:02,290
- Go, Jae Hong.
- I'm flexible.

557
00:18:02,290 --> 00:18:03,670
- Okay.
- Okay. I have high hopes for you.

558
00:18:03,770 --> 00:18:05,060
Good luck.

559
00:18:05,060 --> 00:18:06,670
- Good luck.
- Good luck.

560
00:18:06,670 --> 00:18:09,440
(How much time will he obtain
through his flexibility?)

561
00:18:11,800 --> 00:18:13,040
Go slowly. Okay.

562
00:18:13,040 --> 00:18:15,250
- That's good.
- Loosen up your hips like he did.

563
00:18:15,250 --> 00:18:17,540
- Use your hips.
- Loosen them.

564
00:18:17,540 --> 00:18:19,840
- You look sexy.
- You're doing well.

565
00:18:19,950 --> 00:18:21,380
- Hang in there.
- Here he goes.

566
00:18:21,380 --> 00:18:22,580
It's going fast all of a sudden.

567
00:18:22,580 --> 00:18:24,490
- Sir...
- This is only the beginning.

568
00:18:24,490 --> 00:18:26,350
- Your arms are...
- Hold on.

569
00:18:26,350 --> 00:18:27,520
- No.
- Hang in there.

570
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:29,120
He's already tired.

571
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:30,460
He's exhausted.

572
00:18:30,460 --> 00:18:31,590
Sir!

573
00:18:31,590 --> 00:18:32,730
It's too fast.

574
00:18:32,730 --> 00:18:34,500
- It's faster than before.
- Don't give up.

575
00:18:34,500 --> 00:18:35,560
Don't give up.

576
00:18:35,560 --> 00:18:37,330
- Use your hips.
- Use your hips.

577
00:18:37,330 --> 00:18:38,770
He's going to fall soon.

578
00:18:38,770 --> 00:18:40,240
- No, no.
- Jae Hong.

579
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:41,470
- He's done.
- No!

580
00:18:41,470 --> 00:18:42,800
(After flailing about, he falls.)

581
00:18:42,800 --> 00:18:44,940
- He's done.
- No!

582
00:18:44,940 --> 00:18:46,980
- See? It's not easy.
- Sung Oh was good.

583
00:18:46,980 --> 00:18:48,510
- This is how most of us are.
- Sung Oh.

584
00:18:49,480 --> 00:18:50,750
How many seconds was that?

585
00:18:50,750 --> 00:18:52,450
- 35 seconds.
- What?

586
00:18:52,450 --> 00:18:54,280
That's not bad.

587
00:18:54,280 --> 00:18:56,080
It wasn't this intense before.

588
00:18:56,080 --> 00:18:57,490
35 seconds.

589
00:18:58,160 --> 00:18:59,420
We need to finish it.

590
00:18:59,420 --> 00:19:00,490
We can do it, right?

591
00:19:00,490 --> 00:19:02,190
Come on. Jung Jun Ha finished one
in eight seconds.

592
00:19:02,190 --> 00:19:04,660
- Just go with the water bottle.
- It's impossible to finish that.

593
00:19:04,660 --> 00:19:06,590
No, it's possible.

594
00:19:06,590 --> 00:19:07,730
- No.
- No. Try it then.

595
00:19:07,730 --> 00:19:09,630
- He can do it.
- Let me check the amount.

596
00:19:09,630 --> 00:19:12,360
He must be full because
he had gimbap by himself.

597
00:19:12,360 --> 00:19:13,830
(Is this why you're unsure?)

598
00:19:13,830 --> 00:19:15,740
Right, he must be full.

599
00:19:15,740 --> 00:19:18,480
He must be full. He ate something
while the others were starving.

600
00:19:18,980 --> 00:19:20,180
Is that why?

601
00:19:20,180 --> 00:19:22,680
- Jong Kook, are you being serious?
- How long will this grudge last?

602
00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:25,040
Are you being serious or what?

603
00:19:25,220 --> 00:19:26,280
- He ate by himself.
- He must be full.

604
00:19:26,280 --> 00:19:29,020
We were all starving.

605
00:19:29,020 --> 00:19:30,760
You need to overcome his scolding.

606
00:19:30,760 --> 00:19:33,080
You're only saying that
to make the viewers laugh, right?

607
00:19:33,080 --> 00:19:34,160
Of course.

608
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:35,620
- That's a given.
- Ready,

609
00:19:35,730 --> 00:19:36,850
set...

610
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:43,790
35 seconds?
I doubt you can finish it.

611
00:19:43,790 --> 00:19:45,130
Why would you say that already?

612
00:19:45,130 --> 00:19:47,410
- You're on the same team.
- Don't demotivate him like that.

613
00:19:47,410 --> 00:19:49,510
- Should I not?
- You shouldn't be like that.

614
00:19:49,630 --> 00:19:51,010
10 seconds have passed.

615
00:19:51,010 --> 00:19:52,710
- You can do it.
- He can.

616
00:19:52,710 --> 00:19:54,040
- He'll succeed.
- It's only been 10 seconds.

617
00:19:54,040 --> 00:19:55,250
- It's going to work.
- You can do it.

618
00:19:55,250 --> 00:19:58,020
- Let your stomach do all the work.
- He's going to succeed.

619
00:19:58,020 --> 00:20:00,750
- 20 seconds have passed.
- Haha, you're almost there.

620
00:20:00,750 --> 00:20:02,150
- You can do it!
- One more bite.

621
00:20:02,150 --> 00:20:03,550
- You're almost there.
- One more time.

622
00:20:03,550 --> 00:20:04,550
You have five seconds!

623
00:20:04,550 --> 00:20:05,660
(He's almost done.)

624
00:20:05,660 --> 00:20:07,190
- You're almost there.
- You can do it!

625
00:20:07,190 --> 00:20:09,320
- 30 seconds have passed.
- You have five seconds!

626
00:20:09,320 --> 00:20:12,850
(He needs to empty the bowl
as well as his mouth.)

627
00:20:12,850 --> 00:20:14,230
(Will he succeed?)

628
00:20:14,230 --> 00:20:16,020
- 3, 4,
- He did it.

629
00:20:16,440 --> 00:20:17,740
- five.
- He did it.

630
00:20:17,740 --> 00:20:18,830
(35 seconds are over.)

631
00:20:19,170 --> 00:20:21,330
(Now, it's up for the producer
to decide.)

632
00:20:21,330 --> 00:20:22,470
He passed, right?

633
00:20:22,470 --> 00:20:23,980
- He finished it.
- You've failed.

634
00:20:24,180 --> 00:20:25,630
- He's failed?
- The food isn't inside his mouth.

635
00:20:25,630 --> 00:20:27,070
You've failed.

636
00:20:27,070 --> 00:20:28,710
So why in the world
did you have to eat that gimbap?

637
00:20:28,710 --> 00:20:29,980
Why did you?

638
00:20:29,980 --> 00:20:33,020
I knew we had to eat jjajangmyeon.
That's why I told you not to eat.

639
00:20:33,020 --> 00:20:34,950
- You're just too full right now.
- My goodness.

640
00:20:34,950 --> 00:20:36,920
I saw this coming
ever since he ate that gimbap.

641
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:38,760
He had an entire roll.

642
00:20:38,760 --> 00:20:41,320
- And it was tuna, at that.
- You're right.

643
00:20:41,460 --> 00:20:43,700
- He gobbled it up.
- You're right.

644
00:20:43,700 --> 00:20:44,850
We should do it.

645
00:20:44,850 --> 00:20:45,900
Okay.

646
00:20:45,900 --> 00:20:47,730
- Sora, you must succeed.
- Good luck.

647
00:20:47,730 --> 00:20:49,120
- Good luck.
- Let's go, Sora!

648
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:50,630
You can do this!

649
00:20:50,630 --> 00:20:52,360
At least stay on there
for 35 seconds.

650
00:20:52,360 --> 00:20:53,910
We can finish the bowl then.

651
00:20:53,910 --> 00:20:56,130
- Don't let it speed up too fast.
- Right.

652
00:20:56,480 --> 00:20:59,910
You said it like
you have authority over it.

653
00:21:00,150 --> 00:21:03,250
He always becomes haughty
when we have guests.

654
00:21:03,270 --> 00:21:06,040
- What authority do you have?
- I just asked.

655
00:21:06,040 --> 00:21:08,150
"Don't let it speed up too fast."

656
00:21:08,610 --> 00:21:10,420
- I'm asking you.
- The guy looked at you...

657
00:21:10,420 --> 00:21:11,520
looking completely annoyed.

658
00:21:13,380 --> 00:21:14,930
Gosh.

659
00:21:14,930 --> 00:21:16,930
- Good luck.
- Just give us 30 seconds.

660
00:21:16,930 --> 00:21:18,200
- Okay.
- Is that enough?

661
00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:19,230
- Of course.
- Ready,

662
00:21:19,670 --> 00:21:21,700
- Good luck!
- The longer the better though.

663
00:21:22,820 --> 00:21:24,470
- Okay, good.
- Looking good.

664
00:21:24,470 --> 00:21:26,670
Sora, you've got this.

665
00:21:27,860 --> 00:21:29,240
- She's good.
- She's rocking to the rhythm.

666
00:21:29,470 --> 00:21:31,630
It's speeding up. Stay on it.

667
00:21:31,630 --> 00:21:33,410
- Sora, you're doing great.
- It's faster now.

668
00:21:34,750 --> 00:21:35,840
Wait, she's swaying too much.

669
00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:37,650
- You're doing great.
- But...

670
00:21:37,650 --> 00:21:39,750
- She's quite flexible.
- She's doing great.

671
00:21:39,750 --> 00:21:42,220
- Good.
- What's with that speed?

672
00:21:42,220 --> 00:21:44,280
(Level 3 begins after 20 seconds.)

673
00:21:46,620 --> 00:21:49,080
(She falls off
right after level 3 begins.)

674
00:21:49,430 --> 00:21:50,820
(That's too bad!)

675
00:21:50,820 --> 00:21:52,930
- How long was that?
- 23 seconds.

676
00:21:52,930 --> 00:21:54,790
- It's not much.
- You did well though.

677
00:21:54,790 --> 00:21:56,270
- Right.
- You did a good job.

678
00:21:56,270 --> 00:21:57,830
- The jjajangmyeon.
- In 23 seconds?

679
00:21:57,830 --> 00:21:59,530
- 23 seconds?
- As you know, Jae Suk...

680
00:21:59,530 --> 00:22:00,670
loves noodles.

681
00:22:00,670 --> 00:22:02,440
- He could do it.
- I know he can.

682
00:22:02,440 --> 00:22:04,030
It's completely possible.

683
00:22:04,030 --> 00:22:05,530
He loves noodles...

684
00:22:05,530 --> 00:22:07,410
and didn't eat any gimbap.

685
00:22:07,450 --> 00:22:09,210
(It's possible because...)

686
00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:11,540
- Right.
- Right?

687
00:22:11,540 --> 00:22:13,220
- The gimbap...
- Seriously?

688
00:22:13,220 --> 00:22:14,380
That's enough!

689
00:22:14,450 --> 00:22:15,880
Jae Suk can do it.

690
00:22:15,880 --> 00:22:17,380
(That's enough!)

691
00:22:17,880 --> 00:22:21,190
Why did you eat it then?
It prevented you from succeeding.

692
00:22:21,190 --> 00:22:22,930
- Because of you...
- Unbelievable.

693
00:22:22,930 --> 00:22:23,930
Gosh.

694
00:22:23,930 --> 00:22:25,020
In 23 seconds?

695
00:22:25,020 --> 00:22:27,620
Hold on. Does he only
have to eat the noodles?

696
00:22:27,620 --> 00:22:28,900
- Must he swallow everything?
- His mouth must be empty.

697
00:22:28,900 --> 00:22:30,240
- He must swallow it all?
- Okay.

698
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:32,130
- No way.
- That seems tricky.

699
00:22:32,130 --> 00:22:33,410
- It doesn't seem easy.
- Ready,

700
00:22:33,410 --> 00:22:34,440
- Here I go.
- It hasn't gone mushy yet.

701
00:22:34,440 --> 00:22:35,770
- get set...
- Jae Suk, please.

702
00:22:35,770 --> 00:22:37,630
- It's a lot though.
- This is our last chance.

703
00:22:40,410 --> 00:22:42,100
- See? It's not easy.
- Just wait.

704
00:22:42,100 --> 00:22:44,220
- Count the time for us.
- He may be able to do it.

705
00:22:44,370 --> 00:22:46,450
- He's almost done.
- Just swallow it.

706
00:22:46,490 --> 00:22:48,020
- 8, 9...
- There's still a lot of time.

707
00:22:48,020 --> 00:22:49,520
- He's already half done.
- 10 seconds have passed.

708
00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:51,310
- 10 seconds?
- He might be able to do it.

709
00:22:51,460 --> 00:22:54,280
- He might do it.
- He's swallowing as he goes.

710
00:22:55,230 --> 00:22:56,820
No wonder you're like a llama.

711
00:22:56,820 --> 00:23:00,270
- 18, 19, 20, 21...
- No wonder you're like a llama.

712
00:23:00,820 --> 00:23:01,930
- 22.
- He ate all the noodles.

713
00:23:01,930 --> 00:23:03,060
- 23.
- Time over.

714
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,240
(There are no noodles left
in the dish.)

715
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:08,670
(They only have to check
inside his mouth now.)

716
00:23:08,670 --> 00:23:09,740
He ate it all.

717
00:23:09,830 --> 00:23:12,240
Here. Swallow it.

718
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:13,450
Go on.

719
00:23:13,450 --> 00:23:15,070
Jae Suk...

720
00:23:15,210 --> 00:23:16,410
(10 years of teamwork
shines at times like this.)

721
00:23:16,410 --> 00:23:18,270
Hey, look!

722
00:23:18,270 --> 00:23:20,310
- He ate it all.
- See?

723
00:23:20,310 --> 00:23:21,380
Please open your mouth.

724
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:24,160
- There's nothing in there.
- See?

725
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:26,520
- Okay, you pass.
- Yes!

726
00:23:26,520 --> 00:23:28,430
(The miracle of 23 seconds)

727
00:23:28,430 --> 00:23:29,430
Let's go.

728
00:23:30,260 --> 00:23:32,120
- No way.
- All right.

729
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:35,120
- Okay!
- I can't believe it.

730
00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:37,630
This is because
he didn't eat any gimbap.

731
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:39,290
- Right?
- He didn't eat any gimbap.

732
00:23:39,400 --> 00:23:41,030
- Don't you agree?
- If he had the gimbap too...

733
00:23:41,030 --> 00:23:42,440
It's because he was on
an empty stomach.

734
00:23:42,440 --> 00:23:44,130
- That's why.
- I could suck it all in.

735
00:23:44,130 --> 00:23:45,440
I can't believe he did it
in 23 seconds.

736
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:47,180
- Okay.
- Yeo Been, you're next.

737
00:23:47,180 --> 00:23:48,300
Go, Yeo Been!

738
00:23:48,300 --> 00:23:49,540
- Yeo Been.
- Good luck.

739
00:23:49,540 --> 00:23:51,340
- So she has to succeed?
- Yes.

740
00:23:51,340 --> 00:23:52,950
I'm sure you're aware
of the importance.

741
00:23:52,950 --> 00:23:55,190
We won't succeed
unless you ride this well.

742
00:23:55,250 --> 00:23:57,420
- Okay.
- Good luck!

743
00:23:58,110 --> 00:24:00,230
- Oh, no.
- You can do this. Who knows?

744
00:24:00,620 --> 00:24:02,730
This could reveal
a hidden talent of yours.

745
00:24:02,730 --> 00:24:05,160
I hope it doesn't go too fast.

746
00:24:05,550 --> 00:24:07,430
- What...
- What was that?

747
00:24:07,430 --> 00:24:09,790
(What?)

748
00:24:09,790 --> 00:24:11,360
(What are you doing?)

749
00:24:11,360 --> 00:24:12,740
- What was that?
- Seriously?

750
00:24:12,740 --> 00:24:14,270
- I mean...
- Are you kidding me?

751
00:24:14,270 --> 00:24:16,030
- I didn't expect that.
- What was that?

752
00:24:16,030 --> 00:24:17,300
- We're doomed.
- A slapstick comedy?

753
00:24:17,300 --> 00:24:19,630
She has what it takes
to thrive on variety shows.

754
00:24:19,740 --> 00:24:21,650
In through the front door,
out through the back door.

755
00:24:21,650 --> 00:24:23,450
- What?
- What's wrong with you?

756
00:24:23,450 --> 00:24:25,420
- What is this?
- What are you doing?

757
00:24:25,450 --> 00:24:27,840
- Isn't that a typical...
- This is a slapstick comedy.

758
00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:29,450
This is what the old comedians
used to do.

759
00:24:29,450 --> 00:24:31,350
That's what Kim Yong Man is good at.

760
00:24:31,350 --> 00:24:33,020
- What...
- Look at Yeo Been.

761
00:24:33,430 --> 00:24:35,620
- What's wrong with you?
- Are you kidding me?

762
00:24:35,620 --> 00:24:37,320
- Are you doing this on purpose?
- Of course not.

763
00:24:37,320 --> 00:24:39,090
- What's wrong with you?
- I don't think I can do this.

764
00:24:39,090 --> 00:24:40,730
- Come over here.
- I can't do this.

765
00:24:40,730 --> 00:24:42,670
- I'm not wearing the right pants.
- I'm loving her character!

766
00:24:42,670 --> 00:24:43,740
Me too.

767
00:24:43,740 --> 00:24:45,500
- I can't do this.
- She's a great fit...

768
00:24:45,500 --> 00:24:47,410
- in terms of variety shows.
- What's wrong with her?

769
00:24:47,410 --> 00:24:48,670
(What?)

770
00:24:48,670 --> 00:24:50,210
(Again?)

771
00:24:50,770 --> 00:24:51,830
I don't think I can do this.

772
00:24:51,830 --> 00:24:53,750
- What is this?
- What's wrong?

773
00:24:53,750 --> 00:24:55,650
I don't have
the right pants for this.

774
00:24:55,650 --> 00:24:57,150
Her pants are too slippery.

775
00:24:57,150 --> 00:24:58,150
I'm wearing the wrong pants.

776
00:24:58,150 --> 00:24:59,950
Yeo Been, you're full of surprises.

777
00:24:59,950 --> 00:25:01,250
- There.
- She's good.

778
00:25:01,250 --> 00:25:02,920
- You're set.
- There you go.

779
00:25:02,920 --> 00:25:04,260
Isn't she a deity of death?

780
00:25:04,280 --> 00:25:06,260
- Unbelievable.
- No way.

781
00:25:06,260 --> 00:25:09,730
This type of comedy
was forgotten even among comedians.

782
00:25:09,780 --> 00:25:11,400
- In the past...
- It brought back memories.

783
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:13,770
- Remember Shim Hyung Rae?
- My pants are slippery.

784
00:25:13,770 --> 00:25:15,820
Your pants must really be slippery.

785
00:25:15,820 --> 00:25:17,090
- It's good though.
- It could serve as an advantage.

786
00:25:17,090 --> 00:25:18,270
- Okay.
- It could benefit her.

787
00:25:18,270 --> 00:25:20,630
Right, it could help her
sway easily to the rhythm.

788
00:25:20,630 --> 00:25:21,940
- That's right.
- Let's go.

789
00:25:21,940 --> 00:25:23,740
- Ready,
- Yeo Been, you can do this.

790
00:25:23,740 --> 00:25:25,370
- Please take it easy.
- get set...

791
00:25:26,010 --> 00:25:27,750
- I'm not sure about this.
- She'll easily fall off.

792
00:25:28,570 --> 00:25:29,650
Gosh.

793
00:25:30,180 --> 00:25:32,450
- It's easy at first.
- Right.

794
00:25:32,840 --> 00:25:34,580
But when it starts to swirl...

795
00:25:34,580 --> 00:25:35,840
Keep your back strong.

796
00:25:35,840 --> 00:25:37,880
- Your back!
- There's no rhythm whatsoever.

797
00:25:38,310 --> 00:25:41,020
- Hold on.
- She's not swaying to a rhythm.

798
00:25:41,520 --> 00:25:43,850
- No way.
- How can one be like this?

799
00:25:44,730 --> 00:25:46,350
- Hey!
- Hang on a little longer.

800
00:25:46,350 --> 00:25:48,230
Please, just a while longer...

801
00:25:48,620 --> 00:25:50,470
- Oh, no.
- Please, just a while longer...

802
00:25:50,470 --> 00:25:52,400
(She drops as soon
as level 3 begins.)

803
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:53,440
No!

804
00:25:54,270 --> 00:25:56,060
No! How long was that?

805
00:25:56,410 --> 00:25:57,740
- How long was it?
- 18 seconds.

806
00:25:57,740 --> 00:25:58,740
- Gosh.
- That's only enough time...

807
00:25:58,740 --> 00:26:00,270
- for the bottle.
- Exactly.

808
00:26:00,270 --> 00:26:02,750
- There's no other option.
- We have to go for the bottle.

809
00:26:02,840 --> 00:26:04,270
Gosh, I'm sorry.

810
00:26:04,270 --> 00:26:06,340
- No, you did great.
- It was hilarious.

811
00:26:06,340 --> 00:26:08,950
(Suk Jin tries the bottle flip.)

812
00:26:08,950 --> 00:26:09,990
(What?)

813
00:26:09,990 --> 00:26:12,110
(He succeeds on his first try.)

814
00:26:12,990 --> 00:26:14,080
(Startled)

815
00:26:14,430 --> 00:26:15,550
- What now?
- Did he do it?

816
00:26:15,550 --> 00:26:18,090
Call me crazy because
I did it on my first try.

817
00:26:18,090 --> 00:26:19,520
- Okay, good.
- What's gotten into me?

818
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:21,970
- The timer wasn't set.
- It must be my lucky year.

819
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:23,270
Unbelievable.

820
00:26:23,470 --> 00:26:24,900
He called it his lucky year.

821
00:26:25,030 --> 00:26:26,910
Ready, get set...

822
00:26:26,910 --> 00:26:28,010
(How will he do in the actual game?)

823
00:26:29,800 --> 00:26:33,680
(What?)

824
00:26:33,680 --> 00:26:35,210
(He succeeded on his first try!)

825
00:26:35,410 --> 00:26:36,680
What?

826
00:26:36,680 --> 00:26:37,680
(It only took him a second.)

827
00:26:38,920 --> 00:26:39,920
Gosh.

828
00:26:40,450 --> 00:26:41,450
(His lower body isn't
as strong as his luck.)

829
00:26:41,450 --> 00:26:42,490
No way.

830
00:26:42,650 --> 00:26:43,660
- My gosh.
- Suk Jin!

831
00:26:43,660 --> 00:26:44,850
No way.

832
00:26:45,020 --> 00:26:46,460
- I can't believe it.
- Seriously?

833
00:26:47,020 --> 00:26:49,120
I thought Suk Jin was going to
collapse from high blood pressure.

834
00:26:49,620 --> 00:26:51,900
- Me too.
- Insane, right?

835
00:26:51,930 --> 00:26:53,930
How I'm on a roll is insane!

836
00:26:53,930 --> 00:26:56,670
Jae Suk, we should have
an ambulance ready just in case.

837
00:26:56,670 --> 00:26:59,360
I thought Suk Jin
was going to collapse.

838
00:26:59,360 --> 00:27:01,010
- Unbelievable.
- He won the game...

839
00:27:01,010 --> 00:27:02,060
at the expense of his health.

840
00:27:02,710 --> 00:27:04,910
Please pick a person to go
from the last team.

841
00:27:05,100 --> 00:27:06,210
Kwang Soo, are you up for it?

842
00:27:06,210 --> 00:27:07,600
- Sure thing.
- Good.

843
00:27:07,650 --> 00:27:08,750
- Kwang Soo.
- Yes?

844
00:27:08,750 --> 00:27:10,650
- Make it at least 30 seconds.
- Sure thing.

845
00:27:10,650 --> 00:27:12,520
Can you eat another bowl
of jjajangmyeon?

846
00:27:12,520 --> 00:27:14,220
- Well, Sora...
- He can eat it instead.

847
00:27:14,220 --> 00:27:15,990
Sora practiced the bottle flip.

848
00:27:15,990 --> 00:27:18,920
(While others took a break,
Sora practiced by herself.)

849
00:27:20,580 --> 00:27:22,380
- Kwang Soo, here you go.
- He'll be good at this.

850
00:27:22,380 --> 00:27:24,550
(Se Chan helps Kwang Soo
put on the headgear.)

851
00:27:24,550 --> 00:27:27,000
- Sora practiced the bottle flip.
- He has it on backward.

852
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:28,670
Kwang Soo,
it's on the other way around.

853
00:27:29,320 --> 00:27:30,360
Just keep it like that.

854
00:27:30,360 --> 00:27:31,670
(Kwang Soo's not an idiot!)

855
00:27:34,940 --> 00:27:36,800
- It's not so bad though.
- It suits you.

856
00:27:36,800 --> 00:27:38,910
- Really?
- You look like a fish.

857
00:27:38,910 --> 00:27:40,150
- That's better.
- It looks better that way.

858
00:27:40,150 --> 00:27:41,650
Doesn't he look like a fish?

859
00:27:41,650 --> 00:27:42,910
- Is it all right?
- Yes.

860
00:27:42,910 --> 00:27:44,070
- It suits you.
- Kwang Soo, you're looking good.

861
00:27:44,070 --> 00:27:46,040
(Kwang Soo confidently walks over
with his headgear on backward.)

862
00:27:46,040 --> 00:27:47,810
- It suits you.
- Nice.

863
00:27:47,810 --> 00:27:50,350
Make sure you stay on
for at least 30 seconds.

864
00:27:50,350 --> 00:27:51,880
Don't do that.

865
00:27:51,880 --> 00:27:53,280
- Ready,
- Giddy-up!

866
00:27:53,280 --> 00:27:55,260
- get set...
- He's too tall for this.

867
00:27:55,260 --> 00:27:56,730
He's at an advantage
with his long arms.

868
00:27:56,730 --> 00:27:58,730
- See?
- Keep it steady.

869
00:27:58,730 --> 00:28:00,290
- Nice.
- Good job.

870
00:28:00,290 --> 00:28:02,000
- Nice.
- That's it.

871
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:04,000
- You're looking good.
- Good job.

872
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:05,440
- Nice.
- Go for it.

873
00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:06,440
Okay.

874
00:28:06,440 --> 00:28:08,170
- You have a good rhythm.
- Kwang Soo...

875
00:28:08,170 --> 00:28:10,180
- My gosh.
- You're like a machine.

876
00:28:10,180 --> 00:28:11,630
You were made for this.

877
00:28:11,630 --> 00:28:13,270
- You've got this.
- You'll do better than Sung Oh.

878
00:28:13,270 --> 00:28:14,870
- No way.
- Good job.

879
00:28:14,950 --> 00:28:16,650
- Kwang Soo, you're doing great.
- You were made for this.

880
00:28:16,650 --> 00:28:18,220
- He's good at this.
- Way to go!

881
00:28:18,220 --> 00:28:20,220
- He's like a machine.
- He'll have the top record.

882
00:28:20,220 --> 00:28:22,520
- He's really good.
- He's a machine.

883
00:28:22,520 --> 00:28:24,160
The operator seems flustered.

884
00:28:24,160 --> 00:28:25,990
- You're a machine.
- He's making it angry.

885
00:28:25,990 --> 00:28:28,990
- This was a game for Kwang Soo.
- He was made for this.

886
00:28:28,990 --> 00:28:30,820
(Giddy-up!)

887
00:28:31,160 --> 00:28:32,900
- Okay.
- Nice.

888
00:28:32,900 --> 00:28:35,170
(He provokes the horse too much
and ends up falling off.)

889
00:28:35,170 --> 00:28:36,430
Good job.

890
00:28:36,430 --> 00:28:38,200
- A minute.
- A minute?

891
00:28:38,560 --> 00:28:40,740
- Kwang Soo...
- My gosh.

892
00:28:40,740 --> 00:28:43,710
Sora will attempt the bottle flip.

893
00:28:43,910 --> 00:28:45,440
Nice, she has a minute.

894
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:47,180
- Bring the bottle.
- All right.

895
00:28:47,180 --> 00:28:49,910
I see she's the serious type.

896
00:28:49,910 --> 00:28:52,270
(Kwang Soo sacrificed himself
to give her a minute.)

897
00:28:53,750 --> 00:28:55,040
You have one minute.

898
00:28:55,040 --> 00:28:57,260
Ready...
Wait, no more practicing.

899
00:28:57,920 --> 00:28:59,190
- Ready,
- Please.

900
00:28:59,380 --> 00:29:00,550
get set...

901
00:29:01,930 --> 00:29:03,020
You have enough time.

902
00:29:05,400 --> 00:29:06,730
- Gosh.
- You're using too much force.

903
00:29:07,090 --> 00:29:08,200
Yes, that's about it.

904
00:29:08,520 --> 00:29:10,170
(Did something just fly by?)

905
00:29:11,270 --> 00:29:13,830
- Gosh.
- What was that?

906
00:29:13,830 --> 00:29:15,670
(Sung Oh steals the show.)

907
00:29:15,910 --> 00:29:18,130
- Wait.
- Are you all right?

908
00:29:18,130 --> 00:29:20,510
What's wrong with you?

909
00:29:20,680 --> 00:29:23,040
- Gosh.
- What's wrong with you?

910
00:29:23,750 --> 00:29:25,450
You can't let it be that obvious.

911
00:29:25,450 --> 00:29:27,110
- Are you kidding me?
- I mean...

912
00:29:27,110 --> 00:29:29,250
- I wanted to watch from this side.
- He laid out flat.

913
00:29:29,250 --> 00:29:30,420
I wanted to watch from this side.

914
00:29:30,660 --> 00:29:31,720
It's slippery.

915
00:29:31,720 --> 00:29:33,550
- What on earth is wrong with you?
- It's slippery.

916
00:29:33,550 --> 00:29:34,550
(While everyone is laughing...)

917
00:29:34,550 --> 00:29:35,780
Hold on.

918
00:29:36,320 --> 00:29:37,700
30 seconds.

919
00:29:38,120 --> 00:29:39,520
It's all right.
You have enough time.

920
00:29:39,520 --> 00:29:41,620
She's not the deity of death.
Look at how focused she is.

921
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:43,000
Just a little bit more.

922
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:45,290
That's it. You're almost there now.

923
00:29:45,830 --> 00:29:46,830
Flip it a little harder.

924
00:29:46,830 --> 00:29:48,530
You're almost there.

925
00:29:48,530 --> 00:29:50,480
(Just then...)

926
00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:52,300
(She barely succeeds.)

927
00:29:52,300 --> 00:29:53,680
Nice!

928
00:29:53,680 --> 00:29:55,910
It stood right at
the edge of the table.

929
00:29:55,910 --> 00:29:57,950
- Good job.
- Nice.

930
00:29:57,950 --> 00:29:58,950
(Finally, she's able
to see the others around her.)

931
00:29:58,950 --> 00:30:01,650
You will not receive any hints
about the reincarnated members.

932
00:30:01,650 --> 00:30:02,810
- Okay.
- Nice!

933
00:30:02,810 --> 00:30:04,550
- All right.
- Good job.

934
00:30:04,550 --> 00:30:05,810
(The deities of death
must be frustrated.)

935
00:30:05,810 --> 00:30:09,260
Some of the members
are good at slapstick comedy.

936
00:30:09,380 --> 00:30:10,660
We should call them Team Slapstick.

937
00:30:10,660 --> 00:30:13,020
Especially Yeo Been and Sung Oh.

938
00:30:13,020 --> 00:30:14,820
The guests today are hilarious.

939
00:30:14,820 --> 00:30:16,520
Everyone including Yeo Been.

940
00:30:16,520 --> 00:30:18,560
The guests are fun
but our members aren't.

941
00:30:18,560 --> 00:30:19,630
Right.

942
00:30:19,630 --> 00:30:20,830
Who was that directed at?

943
00:30:20,830 --> 00:30:22,940
- Who did you say that to?
- Hang in there.

944
00:30:22,940 --> 00:30:24,680
- Who?
- Hang in there.

945
00:30:24,680 --> 00:30:27,300
- I'm taking a break this week.
- Stay strong, Suk Jin.

946
00:30:27,410 --> 00:30:29,450
- He's taking a break.
- A break.

947
00:30:29,450 --> 00:30:30,840
- Suk Jin, hang in there.
- Sure.

948
00:30:30,840 --> 00:30:34,040
Right now, for 10 minutes,
the deities of death...

949
00:30:34,110 --> 00:30:36,650
will try and rip off your name tags.

950
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:38,720
- That's out of the blue.
- Why?

951
00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:40,580
But we didn't receive any hints.

952
00:30:40,930 --> 00:30:43,260
Only the deities of death
may eliminate anyone.

953
00:30:43,520 --> 00:30:44,900
Over the course of three rounds,

954
00:30:44,900 --> 00:30:47,500
the deities of death
can eliminate two people each.

955
00:30:47,500 --> 00:30:49,820
The race is over If the reincarnated
members are eliminated.

956
00:30:50,020 --> 00:30:52,470
But if a regular member
gets eliminated,

957
00:30:52,470 --> 00:30:55,210
both the deity of death
and the eliminated member...

958
00:30:55,210 --> 00:30:57,680
will receive a penalty badge each.

959
00:30:57,870 --> 00:31:00,770
Even if you're not reincarnated,
be careful not to get eliminated.

960
00:31:00,770 --> 00:31:02,040
It'll become obvious.

961
00:31:02,040 --> 00:31:03,410
Let's start...

962
00:31:03,450 --> 00:31:07,190
- the name tag elimination.
- Right now?

963
00:31:07,190 --> 00:31:08,340
Right here?

964
00:31:08,750 --> 00:31:10,760
- Are we supposed to run?
- What?

965
00:31:10,760 --> 00:31:12,280
Ordinary members can't rip off
name tags, right?

966
00:31:12,760 --> 00:31:14,520
- Are you a deity of death?
- She must be a deity of death.

967
00:31:14,520 --> 00:31:15,520
I'm not.

968
00:31:15,550 --> 00:31:16,780
Are you a deity of death?

969
00:31:16,820 --> 00:31:18,320
- What are you doing?
- What's with Yeo Been?

970
00:31:18,350 --> 00:31:19,760
So Min, what are you doing there?

971
00:31:20,290 --> 00:31:21,790
You want to make it so obvious?

972
00:31:21,790 --> 00:31:23,520
- I'm nothing.
- She's acting strange today.

973
00:31:23,700 --> 00:31:25,360
I'm just sick.

974
00:31:25,360 --> 00:31:27,740
Are you pretending to be sick
because you're a deity of death?

975
00:31:27,740 --> 00:31:28,940
- What is she doing?
- Gosh, you startled me.

976
00:31:29,210 --> 00:31:30,330
Gosh.

977
00:31:30,330 --> 00:31:32,870
(Is Yeo Been going for name tags
because she is a deity of death?)

978
00:31:32,870 --> 00:31:34,270
I know you're not a deity of death.

979
00:31:34,480 --> 00:31:36,950
They wouldn't give you such a role.

980
00:31:37,070 --> 00:31:38,220
You're too weak.

981
00:31:38,310 --> 00:31:39,750
I'm not as weak as you are.

982
00:31:40,720 --> 00:31:41,780
(The weak middle-aged men
are squabbling.)

983
00:31:41,780 --> 00:31:42,810
I'll rip off your name tag.

984
00:31:43,110 --> 00:31:44,220
You're not a deity of death,
are you?

985
00:31:44,460 --> 00:31:45,610
- I'm not.
- I knew it.

986
00:31:45,610 --> 00:31:47,430
If I was, your name tag would have
come off.

987
00:31:48,120 --> 00:31:49,350
I wouldn't let that happen.

988
00:31:50,930 --> 00:31:52,230
(The weakest members
keep squabbling.)

989
00:31:52,230 --> 00:31:53,700
What are you doing? Gosh.

990
00:31:54,620 --> 00:31:55,730
What are you doing? Gosh.

991
00:31:55,730 --> 00:31:56,790
I will not...

992
00:31:56,900 --> 00:31:57,940
What?

993
00:31:58,200 --> 00:31:59,200
(Suk Jin is startled
and slurs his words.)

994
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:00,270
Go away!

995
00:32:00,270 --> 00:32:01,440
What did you say?

996
00:32:01,560 --> 00:32:02,800
What does that mean?

997
00:32:02,800 --> 00:32:04,480
- I don't understand.
- Go away!

998
00:32:05,010 --> 00:32:06,180
Let's go upstairs.

999
00:32:06,870 --> 00:32:07,980
In the elevator?

1000
00:32:07,980 --> 00:32:09,680
(Se Chan suggests to Kwang Soo
they go upstairs.)

1001
00:32:09,680 --> 00:32:11,420
(What's on his mind?)

1002
00:32:11,420 --> 00:32:12,750
You're not a deity of death‚
are you?

1003
00:32:13,040 --> 00:32:14,150
I'm not.

1004
00:32:14,920 --> 00:32:17,760
(Kwang Soo follows him carefully.)

1005
00:32:17,760 --> 00:32:19,720
(Suddenly...)

1006
00:32:19,720 --> 00:32:21,960
(Se Chan grabs
Kwang Soo's name tag.)

1007
00:32:21,960 --> 00:32:23,230
I'm not a deity of death.
What's with you?

1008
00:32:23,230 --> 00:32:24,820
Why do you look so nervous?

1009
00:32:24,820 --> 00:32:26,000
If you're a deity of death,
rip off my name tag now.

1010
00:32:26,200 --> 00:32:27,360
I'm serious.

1011
00:32:27,430 --> 00:32:28,520
You're not a deity of death,
are you?

1012
00:32:28,520 --> 00:32:30,090
I'm not. If you are,
rip off name tag now.

1013
00:32:30,090 --> 00:32:31,170
Do you want to be a deity of death?

1014
00:32:31,240 --> 00:32:32,900
- I think that'd be easier.
- Okay.

1015
00:32:32,900 --> 00:32:34,440
(Both the deity of death and the
member can receive a penalty badge.)

1016
00:32:35,010 --> 00:32:36,130
You're not?

1017
00:32:36,130 --> 00:32:37,680
(Is either of them
a deity of death?)

1018
00:32:38,570 --> 00:32:39,800
Hey!

1019
00:32:40,680 --> 00:32:41,840
What happened?

1020
00:32:42,100 --> 00:32:43,210
Did you get eliminated?

1021
00:32:43,210 --> 00:32:44,370
(Why did Kwang Soo scream?)

1022
00:32:44,770 --> 00:32:46,610
- Gosh, this is annoying.
- Who eliminated who?

1023
00:32:46,610 --> 00:32:48,080
(What's going on?)

1024
00:32:48,080 --> 00:32:49,540
Gosh.

1025
00:32:49,990 --> 00:32:51,810
- Did you see that?
- Unbelievable.

1026
00:32:51,810 --> 00:32:52,960
(Both their name tags are
barely attached.)

1027
00:32:52,960 --> 00:32:54,120
- Gosh.
- I didn't see it.

1028
00:32:54,520 --> 00:32:58,590
(They're both claiming that
their name tags got ripped off.)

1029
00:32:59,260 --> 00:33:00,470
This is crazy.

1030
00:33:01,730 --> 00:33:03,290
So one of you is a deity of death?

1031
00:33:03,830 --> 00:33:05,130
- Hey.
- Unbelievable.

1032
00:33:05,130 --> 00:33:08,130
(Who is a deity of death,
Se Chan or Kwang Soo?)

1033
00:33:08,670 --> 00:33:10,060
(The race is over.)

1034
00:33:10,060 --> 00:33:12,940
I can't believe it.
I was at the scene.

1035
00:33:14,040 --> 00:33:15,510
- Who is it?
- I'm not sure.

1036
00:33:15,570 --> 00:33:17,010
It's one of the two.

1037
00:33:17,010 --> 00:33:18,480
- It's driving me crazy.
- Who are they? Tell me.

1038
00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:20,990
Guys, listen to me.

1039
00:33:21,650 --> 00:33:23,340
Look. They both got a penalty badge.

1040
00:33:23,520 --> 00:33:24,920
I saw it.

1041
00:33:24,920 --> 00:33:27,730
(Both of them are wearing
a penalty badge on their chest.)

1042
00:33:27,990 --> 00:33:31,160
- One of them is a deity of death?
- Unbelievable.

1043
00:33:31,460 --> 00:33:32,820
Let me tell you one thing.

1044
00:33:32,900 --> 00:33:34,320
One of them is a deity of death.

1045
00:33:34,820 --> 00:33:36,060
Se Chan is.

1046
00:33:36,090 --> 00:33:37,290
- Jong Kook.
- I'm not.

1047
00:33:37,530 --> 00:33:39,170
- Didn't you see me do the rodeo?
- I did.

1048
00:33:39,360 --> 00:33:40,440
What about me?

1049
00:33:40,440 --> 00:33:41,530
- Se Chan.
- Yes?

1050
00:33:41,530 --> 00:33:43,800
It's okay to say
that you're a deity of death.

1051
00:33:43,800 --> 00:33:45,270
It's not like I can eliminate you.

1052
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:46,600
What if I'm not?

1053
00:33:46,600 --> 00:33:48,070
I can say that too, right? I'm not.

1054
00:33:48,070 --> 00:33:49,300
Is it you then?

1055
00:33:49,910 --> 00:33:51,610
I did the rodeo
for more than a minute.

1056
00:33:51,610 --> 00:33:54,380
- He couldn't be a deity of death.
- For more than a minute.

1057
00:33:54,380 --> 00:33:56,780
- He did his best.
- Also,

1058
00:33:56,840 --> 00:33:59,720
I would have volunteered
to eat jjajangmyeon.

1059
00:33:59,720 --> 00:34:02,050
- Jong Kook, but...
- Se Chan, it's okay to say it.

1060
00:34:02,050 --> 00:34:04,000
Jong Kook is doing it again.

1061
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:05,960
- I'm on his radar again.
- Say it.

1062
00:34:06,020 --> 00:34:07,790
- It's okay to say it.
- Say who the other is.

1063
00:34:07,790 --> 00:34:09,060
(Which of them is a deity of death?)

1064
00:34:09,060 --> 00:34:10,630
- Seriously...
- I mean...

1065
00:34:10,630 --> 00:34:12,240
- You're so mean.
- What's wrong?

1066
00:34:12,330 --> 00:34:13,630
What happens now?

1067
00:34:13,630 --> 00:34:16,840
More penalty badges
have been distributed.

1068
00:34:16,940 --> 00:34:18,670
The deity of death race
for the first round is over.

1069
00:34:18,670 --> 00:34:20,710
I will pick two more
deities of death now.

1070
00:34:20,900 --> 00:34:22,900
If the same person
from the first round...

1071
00:34:22,900 --> 00:34:24,050
is picked again,

1072
00:34:24,050 --> 00:34:25,670
that chance is gone.

1073
00:34:25,670 --> 00:34:27,050
Therefore, there may not be
four deities of death.

1074
00:34:27,150 --> 00:34:28,690
I'd rather be a deity of death.

1075
00:34:28,780 --> 00:34:30,590
Can you turn around for a second?

1076
00:34:30,590 --> 00:34:34,190
(Two more deities of death
are picked.)

1077
00:34:34,190 --> 00:34:35,550
(Round 1)

1078
00:34:35,550 --> 00:34:36,880
(Round 2)

1079
00:34:37,360 --> 00:34:38,920
(One person is picked again.)

1080
00:34:38,920 --> 00:34:41,460
- All right. I'm done.
- Okay.

1081
00:34:41,460 --> 00:34:42,670
(There are 3 deities of death
in total.)

1082
00:34:42,670 --> 00:34:43,960
- Sung Oh.
- Come on.

1083
00:34:44,070 --> 00:34:46,190
I want to be a deity of death.

1084
00:34:46,190 --> 00:34:47,500
(The result is texted to them.)

1085
00:34:47,500 --> 00:34:48,800
- They're chosen randomly.
- I've never been chosen.

1086
00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:51,130
- I wasn't chosen.
- Me neither.

1087
00:34:51,570 --> 00:34:52,780
They're not giving me the role.

1088
00:34:52,780 --> 00:34:54,750
The first round is over.

1089
00:34:54,750 --> 00:34:56,670
Let's move to another place
for the second round.

1090
00:34:56,670 --> 00:34:57,780
- Okay.
- Okay.

1091
00:34:57,780 --> 00:35:00,070
- Let's go.
- I can't believe Kwang Soo.

1092
00:35:00,170 --> 00:35:01,340
Se Chan!

1093
00:35:01,750 --> 00:35:03,650
- What is this?
- What is this?

1094
00:35:03,650 --> 00:35:06,020
Here is the second mission
for all members.

1095
00:35:06,280 --> 00:35:08,690
- It's called Rumor Has It.
- Rumor Has It?

1096
00:35:08,690 --> 00:35:10,800
Each round will be played
by six members.

1097
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:13,960
You'll put on headphones
and deliver a sentence...

1098
00:35:13,960 --> 00:35:15,300
to the next player.

1099
00:35:15,300 --> 00:35:19,030
To win, get the correct sentence
delivered to the last player.

1100
00:35:19,030 --> 00:35:21,440
If you get 2 out of 3 sentences
correct, you succeed.

1101
00:35:21,770 --> 00:35:23,500
If the mission fails,

1102
00:35:23,500 --> 00:35:26,210
all members will receive a hint
about the reincarnated members.

1103
00:35:26,210 --> 00:35:28,210
I'm afraid too many members will
act like deities of death.

1104
00:35:28,210 --> 00:35:29,880
- Right.
- Right.

1105
00:35:29,980 --> 00:35:31,480
There are many suspicious members.

1106
00:35:31,980 --> 00:35:33,980
There are too many.
It's so hard today.

1107
00:35:34,110 --> 00:35:36,440
Please choose six representatives.

1108
00:35:36,440 --> 00:35:38,320
(The 6 representatives
for the 1st question)

1109
00:35:38,320 --> 00:35:39,750
(Jong Kook, Se Chan, So Min,
Kwang Soo, Ji Hyo, and Haha)

1110
00:35:39,750 --> 00:35:41,480
- Try to deliver the main idea.
- Exactly.

1111
00:35:41,480 --> 00:35:42,590
- That's right.
- That's right.

1112
00:35:42,590 --> 00:35:45,090
The first player should summarize
the sentence well...

1113
00:35:45,090 --> 00:35:46,300
- deliver it correctly.
- Right.

1114
00:35:46,300 --> 00:35:48,820
I'll do my best.

1115
00:35:48,820 --> 00:35:49,920
- Let's show them.
- Seriously.

1116
00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:51,190
Let's win a hint.

1117
00:35:51,190 --> 00:35:52,730
Let's watch carefully.

1118
00:35:52,730 --> 00:35:54,300
Some of them may be
deities of death.

1119
00:35:54,440 --> 00:35:56,840
- I'm sure.
- Definitely.

1120
00:35:56,840 --> 00:35:59,300
Either Se Chan or Kwang Soo is
a deity of death.

1121
00:35:59,300 --> 00:36:00,710
Right. We should watch them.

1122
00:36:00,710 --> 00:36:04,070
Here we go. Ready, get set, go.

1123
00:36:07,480 --> 00:36:08,940
This is impossible.

1124
00:36:10,110 --> 00:36:12,610
- I can't even remember the names.
- I don't understand a thing.

1125
00:36:12,710 --> 00:36:14,880
- That's hard.
- That's impossible to remember.

1126
00:36:14,880 --> 00:36:16,920
- Gosh.
- This won't work.

1127
00:36:16,980 --> 00:36:18,590
It's just impossible.

1128
00:36:18,590 --> 00:36:21,570
- I couldn't memorize half of it.
- I've lost all my will.

1129
00:36:21,570 --> 00:36:23,590
You'd have to already know
the names...

1130
00:36:23,590 --> 00:36:26,590
of the players and coaches
to memorize it.

1131
00:36:27,130 --> 00:36:28,360
This is too hard.

1132
00:36:28,530 --> 00:36:30,670
Just make it as close
to the original sentence as you can.

1133
00:36:31,210 --> 00:36:32,380
(While Jong Kook is memorizing
the sentence,)

1134
00:36:32,380 --> 00:36:34,570
(the others are dancing.)

1135
00:36:35,550 --> 00:36:36,800
I know this dance.

1136
00:36:37,940 --> 00:36:40,520
(They're dancing
pretty much in sync.)

1137
00:36:41,050 --> 00:36:43,250
(Jong Kook is serious,
but the others are having fun.)

1138
00:36:43,590 --> 00:36:44,610
It's that song.

1139
00:36:44,780 --> 00:36:45,880
Let's start.

1140
00:36:46,280 --> 00:36:48,280
(Jong Kook delivers
the sentence to Se Chan.)

1141
00:36:48,650 --> 00:36:51,530
- Listen, guys.
- "Listen, guys."

1142
00:36:51,530 --> 00:36:53,750
- In the Champions League...
- "In the Champions League..."

1143
00:36:53,750 --> 00:36:55,920
Sadio Mane scored a hat trick.

1144
00:36:55,920 --> 00:36:57,400
- Who?
- Sadio Mane.

1145
00:36:57,400 --> 00:36:59,300
- Sadio Mane.
- You don't know who he is?

1146
00:36:59,300 --> 00:37:01,670
- "Sadio Mane"?
- Yes, Sadio Mane.

1147
00:37:01,940 --> 00:37:04,440
- Sadio Mane and...
- "Sadio Mane".

1148
00:37:04,500 --> 00:37:06,940
Jurgen Klopp,
the manager of Liverpool...

1149
00:37:07,670 --> 00:37:10,250
- That's English.
- Yes.

1150
00:37:10,250 --> 00:37:11,710
(The English names
put Se Chan in trouble.)

1151
00:37:11,710 --> 00:37:13,420
- Jurgen Klopp is the manager.
- What was the other name?

1152
00:37:13,420 --> 00:37:14,440
Sadro Malen?

1153
00:37:14,440 --> 00:37:16,110
- It's Sadio Mane.
- "Sadio Mane".

1154
00:37:16,110 --> 00:37:18,960
I want autographs of Sadio Mane
and the manager, Klopp.

1155
00:37:19,250 --> 00:37:22,250
The player who became a free agent
according to the Bosman ruling...

1156
00:37:22,860 --> 00:37:24,800
(It's perfect so far.)

1157
00:37:24,900 --> 00:37:27,500
- Samuel Umtiti...
- Oh, my.

1158
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:30,320
(Jong Kooks is incredible.)

1159
00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:31,690
Bring him to Camp Nou.

1160
00:37:31,690 --> 00:37:32,840
Do you know it?

1161
00:37:33,170 --> 00:37:34,710
- Camp Nou.
- I don't.

1162
00:37:34,710 --> 00:37:35,800
(Se Chan is about to cry.)

1163
00:37:36,530 --> 00:37:38,500
(How can you not know it
when you play soccer with me?)

1164
00:37:39,400 --> 00:37:40,480
(I'll make you remember it.)

1165
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:41,980
- Camp Nou.
- "Camp Nou".

1166
00:37:42,210 --> 00:37:43,840
Se Chan, hurry up.

1167
00:37:43,900 --> 00:37:45,610
Bring him to Camp Nou.

1168
00:37:46,070 --> 00:37:49,380
I want him in the back seat
of my six-seater SUV.

1169
00:37:49,380 --> 00:37:51,860
(Perfect)

1170
00:37:51,860 --> 00:37:54,780
(Jong Kook delivered the 100-word
paragraph perfectly.)

1171
00:37:54,780 --> 00:37:56,820
(Jong Kook is amazing.)

1172
00:37:57,320 --> 00:37:58,550
(This is incredible.)

1173
00:37:58,550 --> 00:37:59,730
- He's incredible.
- All right.

1174
00:37:59,730 --> 00:38:01,460
- Listen, guys.
- "Listen, guys."

1175
00:38:01,460 --> 00:38:03,170
- Listen carefully, guys.
- "Listen carefully, guys."

1176
00:38:03,420 --> 00:38:05,270
- Listen carefully, guys.
- The Champions League.

1177
00:38:05,360 --> 00:38:06,500
"The Champions League".

1178
00:38:06,500 --> 00:38:08,670
- In the Champions League...
- "In the Champions League..."

1179
00:38:08,670 --> 00:38:10,940
- A player scored a hat trick.
- "A player scored a hat trick."

1180
00:38:10,940 --> 00:38:13,110
A hat trick. It means
scoring more than three goals.

1181
00:38:13,110 --> 00:38:14,400
What? A hat trick?

1182
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:15,710
Cut that out.

1183
00:38:16,070 --> 00:38:18,440
"Listen, guys. A hat trick
in the Champions League..."

1184
00:38:18,440 --> 00:38:19,550
Okay.

1185
00:38:19,550 --> 00:38:22,520
(The next word is Sadio Mane.)

1186
00:38:22,520 --> 00:38:24,280
(You have to remember it.
It's Sadio Mane.)

1187
00:38:24,280 --> 00:38:27,020
Okay. Simon Murphy.
No, that's not it.

1188
00:38:27,020 --> 00:38:28,190
(Simon Murphy)

1189
00:38:28,280 --> 00:38:29,530
No, that's not it.

1190
00:38:29,530 --> 00:38:31,460
- Just keep going.
- Simon Murphy...

1191
00:38:31,460 --> 00:38:33,420
- Simon Murphy.
- "Simon Murphy".

1192
00:38:33,420 --> 00:38:35,590
- There's a guy called Simon Murphy.
- Simon Murphy?

1193
00:38:35,590 --> 00:38:37,940
- He is called Simon Murphy.
- Simon Murphy?

1194
00:38:37,940 --> 00:38:39,000
And then...

1195
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:42,070
- there is the manager of Liverpool.
- "The manager of Liverpool".

1196
00:38:42,070 --> 00:38:43,500
- His name is Club.
- "Club".

1197
00:38:43,500 --> 00:38:44,880
(His name is Club.)

1198
00:38:45,340 --> 00:38:46,440
"Club"?

1199
00:38:46,440 --> 00:38:48,000
In addition to him,

1200
00:38:48,110 --> 00:38:50,170
there is another manager.

1201
00:38:50,380 --> 00:38:51,780
- Another manager?
- I mean...

1202
00:38:51,780 --> 00:38:53,250
It's an English name again.

1203
00:38:53,250 --> 00:38:54,610
What did Jong Kook say?

1204
00:38:54,610 --> 00:38:56,340
(It was clearly an English name.)

1205
00:38:56,340 --> 00:38:57,380
(All the English names
paralyze Se Chan's brain.)

1206
00:38:57,380 --> 00:38:59,320
Gosh, what was it?

1207
00:38:59,320 --> 00:39:01,860
Si... Siranman?

1208
00:39:01,860 --> 00:39:04,420
- "Siranman"?
- The manager is called Siranman.

1209
00:39:04,420 --> 00:39:05,590
He is transferring.

1210
00:39:05,590 --> 00:39:07,400
And he is getting in
a six-seater SUV.

1211
00:39:07,400 --> 00:39:08,630
- An SUV?
- Yes.

1212
00:39:08,630 --> 00:39:10,400
Who gets in it? Simon Murphy?

1213
00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:12,400
Or the manager of Liverpool,
who is transferring?

1214
00:39:12,400 --> 00:39:13,400
All of them.

1215
00:39:13,400 --> 00:39:14,630
Okay. Liverpool...

1216
00:39:14,630 --> 00:39:17,070
A person called Simon Murphy...

1217
00:39:17,070 --> 00:39:19,900
and he will get in
a six-seater SUV...

1218
00:39:19,900 --> 00:39:21,380
- and leave.
- A six-seater SUV...

1219
00:39:21,380 --> 00:39:23,250
- A hat trick?
- A hat trick.

1220
00:39:23,880 --> 00:39:25,570
(His brain stops functioning.)

1221
00:39:25,650 --> 00:39:27,170
- It's hard.
- This is bad.

1222
00:39:27,880 --> 00:39:29,150
Listen carefully, guys.

1223
00:39:30,750 --> 00:39:32,480
- The Champion League.
- "The Champion League".

1224
00:39:32,550 --> 00:39:33,920
- A hat trick.
- "A hat trick".

1225
00:39:33,920 --> 00:39:35,150
- Hat trick.
- That's three goals.

1226
00:39:35,150 --> 00:39:36,750
Someone scored a hat trick.

1227
00:39:36,750 --> 00:39:38,320
And the Liverpool Club...

1228
00:39:38,590 --> 00:39:40,400
- What?
- Liverpool.

1229
00:39:40,400 --> 00:39:41,590
Simon Murphy and...

1230
00:39:41,690 --> 00:39:43,770
- "Simon Murphy"?
- Yes, Simon Murphy.

1231
00:39:43,770 --> 00:39:45,170
And a side trick?

1232
00:39:45,730 --> 00:39:47,170
Sidopick?

1233
00:39:47,170 --> 00:39:48,460
Is that a name?

1234
00:39:48,460 --> 00:39:49,710
Well... Si...

1235
00:39:49,710 --> 00:39:51,480
Simon Murphy of Liverpool...

1236
00:39:51,480 --> 00:39:53,070
and another man
with an English name...

1237
00:39:53,070 --> 00:39:54,610
and Side Trick...

1238
00:39:54,610 --> 00:39:57,340
were put in a six-seater SUV
and sent away.

1239
00:39:58,980 --> 00:40:00,480
She is a deity of death.

1240
00:40:00,650 --> 00:40:02,420
She is definitely a deity of death.

1241
00:40:02,420 --> 00:40:03,750
- Why?
- It wasn't that bad.

1242
00:40:03,750 --> 00:40:05,090
- Keep going, Kwang Soo.
- Keep going.

1243
00:40:05,090 --> 00:40:06,420
- That's what Se Chan said.
- Keep going.

1244
00:40:06,590 --> 00:40:08,190
- You'll hear it later.
- The English names...

1245
00:40:08,190 --> 00:40:10,550
- Listen carefully, guys.
- "Listen carefully, guys."

1246
00:40:10,730 --> 00:40:12,960
Liverpool in the Champions League...

1247
00:40:13,090 --> 00:40:15,900
"Liverpool in
the Champions League..."

1248
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:17,420
A hat trick was scored by...

1249
00:40:18,300 --> 00:40:19,630
Simon Dominic?

1250
00:40:19,630 --> 00:40:21,800
(Simon Dominic?)

1251
00:40:21,800 --> 00:40:24,440
(Simon Dominc Becomes
a Soccer Player)

1252
00:40:24,710 --> 00:40:26,780
<i>Simon, Simon Dominic</i>

1253
00:40:26,780 --> 00:40:28,750
And Simon...

1254
00:40:29,500 --> 00:40:30,650
Diva.

1255
00:40:30,750 --> 00:40:31,840
- "Simon Diva"?
- They...

1256
00:40:32,710 --> 00:40:35,690
were sent away in a six-seater SUV.

1257
00:40:35,690 --> 00:40:36,710
(They were sent away
in a six-seater SUV.)

1258
00:40:38,860 --> 00:40:41,690
- Keep going.
- I want to send you away.

1259
00:40:41,690 --> 00:40:42,860
You want to send me away?

1260
00:40:43,130 --> 00:40:45,150
- Listen, guys.
- "Listen, guys."

1261
00:40:45,590 --> 00:40:46,800
Is it a will?

1262
00:40:46,800 --> 00:40:48,000
It's a will.

1263
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:49,170
(It's a will.)

1264
00:40:49,590 --> 00:40:51,500
(Where did the will come from?)

1265
00:40:51,500 --> 00:40:52,770
It's a will.

1266
00:40:53,630 --> 00:40:56,340
This man is dividing his property
on his deathbed.

1267
00:40:56,500 --> 00:40:58,380
- Look at Ji Hyo.
- This man is dividing the property.

1268
00:40:58,380 --> 00:41:00,530
That's the only thing that comes
out of a will.

1269
00:41:00,530 --> 00:41:02,250
- I can't believe Ji Hyo.
- Listen, guys.

1270
00:41:02,250 --> 00:41:03,250
It's a will.

1271
00:41:03,250 --> 00:41:04,610
In the Champions League,

1272
00:41:05,380 --> 00:41:06,520
Liverpool...

1273
00:41:07,380 --> 00:41:08,590
is it.

1274
00:41:08,590 --> 00:41:10,020
(In the Champions League,
Liverpool is it.)

1275
00:41:10,780 --> 00:41:11,980
So that's the will?

1276
00:41:12,090 --> 00:41:13,150
The will!

1277
00:41:13,150 --> 00:41:15,750
"In the Champions League,
Liverpool is it."

1278
00:41:15,750 --> 00:41:16,820
(It sounds strange,
but he focuses once more.)

1279
00:41:16,820 --> 00:41:18,590
- A hat trick...
- "A hat trick".

1280
00:41:18,590 --> 00:41:19,730
Then there was
some kind of a league.

1281
00:41:19,730 --> 00:41:21,170
(The will comes up blank.)

1282
00:41:21,170 --> 00:41:22,400
It's a six-seater.

1283
00:41:22,400 --> 00:41:23,900
(It's a six-seater.)

1284
00:41:23,900 --> 00:41:27,940
(It's the will of someone
who wanted to ride a six-seater.)

1285
00:41:27,940 --> 00:41:29,460
The diva of a six-seater.

1286
00:41:29,800 --> 00:41:31,230
The diva of a six-seater?

1287
00:41:31,530 --> 00:41:32,610
Ji Hyo, that's good.

1288
00:41:32,610 --> 00:41:34,250
Ji Hyo got all the key points.

1289
00:41:34,250 --> 00:41:35,380
The diva of a six-seater?

1290
00:41:35,380 --> 00:41:37,920
- It isn't a will, is it?
- Don't add things!

1291
00:41:38,610 --> 00:41:39,820
Listen carefully, guys.

1292
00:41:40,940 --> 00:41:42,110
(He tries to make a sentence
from what he heard.)

1293
00:41:42,110 --> 00:41:44,590
Europe... The UK...

1294
00:41:45,650 --> 00:41:48,650
- The Champions League.
- He doesn't know much about soccer.

1295
00:41:49,130 --> 00:41:50,320
Liverpool...

1296
00:41:50,320 --> 00:41:51,920
(Listen, guys, The Champions League,
and Liverpool)

1297
00:41:52,420 --> 00:41:55,190
I sincerely congratulate you
on six consecutive victories.

1298
00:41:55,190 --> 00:41:57,170
(He changes a 6-seater
to 6 consecutive wins.)

1299
00:41:57,170 --> 00:42:00,170
(100 words turned into 1 sentence.)

1300
00:42:00,670 --> 00:42:01,860
(This is how scary it is
to spread words.)

1301
00:42:01,860 --> 00:42:04,110
Did I get it wrong?
It can't be a six-seater.

1302
00:42:04,110 --> 00:42:05,210
Did I get it wrong?

1303
00:42:05,210 --> 00:42:06,610
- I heard a six-seater.
- What?

1304
00:42:06,610 --> 00:42:08,610
- Jong Kook memorized it perfectly.
- Really?

1305
00:42:08,610 --> 00:42:11,750
- Ji Hyo said, "It's a will."
- I was so taken aback.

1306
00:42:11,750 --> 00:42:13,320
Ji Hyo, it was funny.

1307
00:42:14,210 --> 00:42:16,590
- This is your last chance.
- The last chance.

1308
00:42:16,590 --> 00:42:18,210
Let's change two players.

1309
00:42:18,210 --> 00:42:19,820
- Let's do that.
- I will give it a try.

1310
00:42:19,820 --> 00:42:21,590
Suk Jin, I am sorry, but...

1311
00:42:21,590 --> 00:42:23,150
- I will give it a try. I can do it.
- Suk Jin.

1312
00:42:23,150 --> 00:42:25,150
If you want to make Yeo Been
a star,

1313
00:42:25,150 --> 00:42:26,590
- you should give her a chance.
- Yeo Been.

1314
00:42:27,090 --> 00:42:28,630
Suk Jin, we need to succeed.

1315
00:42:28,630 --> 00:42:30,000
(He wants to be more popular
than Yeo Been.)

1316
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:32,170
Let's begin. Here we go.

1317
00:42:32,690 --> 00:42:34,630
- My goodness.
- Listen, guys.

1318
00:42:34,630 --> 00:42:37,070
(The 142m² Hanmaeum Apartment
at Seocho-gu...)

1319
00:42:37,070 --> 00:42:38,670
That one is hard too.

1320
00:42:38,670 --> 00:42:40,500
- Seriously.
- It must be hard.

1321
00:42:40,500 --> 00:42:42,650
It's hard. It isn't easy.

1322
00:42:42,650 --> 00:42:46,150
(Will Jong Kook be able
to memorize it perfectly?)

1323
00:42:46,150 --> 00:42:48,440
(The 142m² Hanmaeum Apartment
at Seocho-gu...)

1324
00:42:49,090 --> 00:42:51,110
(Jong Kook to Sora)

1325
00:42:51,110 --> 00:42:52,750
- Listen, guys.
- It's "Listen, guys" again.

1326
00:42:52,750 --> 00:42:54,050
Listen, guys.

1327
00:42:54,050 --> 00:42:58,630
The 142m² Hanmaeum Apartment
at Seocho-gu...

1328
00:42:58,630 --> 00:43:01,460
should go to the 2nd and 3rd child.

1329
00:43:01,460 --> 00:43:05,670
Give the pet armadillo...

1330
00:43:05,670 --> 00:43:07,070
and kissing gourami...

1331
00:43:07,710 --> 00:43:09,400
to my nephew, Jae Hong.

1332
00:43:09,900 --> 00:43:11,880
And...

1333
00:43:11,980 --> 00:43:13,230
the monkey...

1334
00:43:13,230 --> 00:43:14,840
(He remembers that part.)

1335
00:43:14,840 --> 00:43:16,210
What kind of monkey was it?

1336
00:43:16,570 --> 00:43:18,250
Donate the monkey...

1337
00:43:18,420 --> 00:43:22,380
to the Nairobi National Park
of Kenya.

1338
00:43:22,710 --> 00:43:24,780
(He missed "mandrill monkey,"
but it's perfect otherwise.)

1339
00:43:25,590 --> 00:43:27,210
(Sora to Jae Hong)

1340
00:43:27,210 --> 00:43:28,420
- It's a will.
- A will.

1341
00:43:28,420 --> 00:43:31,030
Listen, guys. The Hanmaeum Apartment
at Seocho-gu...

1342
00:43:31,030 --> 00:43:33,650
- The 142m² Hanmaeum Apartment...
- 142m²?

1343
00:43:33,820 --> 00:43:37,960
should go to the 2nd and 3rd child.

1344
00:43:37,960 --> 00:43:40,190
Give the pet armadillo...

1345
00:43:40,460 --> 00:43:43,460
and kissing gourami
to my nephew, Jae Hong.

1346
00:43:43,610 --> 00:43:47,440
And... What was the last one?
What was the last one?

1347
00:43:47,500 --> 00:43:49,300
Remember the last one.

1348
00:43:49,300 --> 00:43:51,880
(She tries to remember it.)

1349
00:43:52,380 --> 00:43:55,250
The pet elephant...

1350
00:43:56,050 --> 00:43:57,050
No, no.

1351
00:43:57,110 --> 00:44:01,230
Donate something to
the Nairobi National Park of Kenya.

1352
00:44:01,380 --> 00:44:02,980
What was it?

1353
00:44:02,980 --> 00:44:04,530
(She ends up changing
the monkey to the elephant.)

1354
00:44:05,030 --> 00:44:07,030
(Jae Hong to Yeo Been)

1355
00:44:07,030 --> 00:44:08,130
What was it?

1356
00:44:09,030 --> 00:44:10,530
- It's a will.
- "It's a will."

1357
00:44:10,730 --> 00:44:12,530
- Listen, guys.
- "Listen, guys."

1358
00:44:13,300 --> 00:44:17,530
The 142m² Hanmaeum Apartment
at Seocho-gu...

1359
00:44:17,940 --> 00:44:19,610
should go to the 2nd and 3rd child.

1360
00:44:19,710 --> 00:44:21,550
Give the pet armadillo...

1361
00:44:22,150 --> 00:44:23,800
and kissing gourami...

1362
00:44:24,150 --> 00:44:26,670
- to my nephew, Jae Hong.
- My nephew, Jae Hong.

1363
00:44:28,050 --> 00:44:29,150
(What was the last one?)

1364
00:44:29,150 --> 00:44:30,780
- The rhino...
- The rhino.

1365
00:44:30,780 --> 00:44:32,250
(The rhino...)

1366
00:44:32,250 --> 00:44:33,520
The rhino.

1367
00:44:33,520 --> 00:44:35,630
(Monkey to elephant to rhino)

1368
00:44:35,630 --> 00:44:36,980
Keep going.

1369
00:44:37,530 --> 00:44:39,000
Give it to someone.

1370
00:44:39,230 --> 00:44:40,650
Give the rhino to someone.

1371
00:44:41,090 --> 00:44:42,770
(Donate it
to the Nairobi National Park!)

1372
00:44:43,590 --> 00:44:45,300
(Yeo Been to Kwang Soo)

1373
00:44:45,300 --> 00:44:47,530
Listen, guys. It's a will.

1374
00:44:48,210 --> 00:44:49,210
Again?

1375
00:44:49,900 --> 00:44:51,730
Is it a will again?

1376
00:44:52,610 --> 00:44:56,280
The 142m² apartment at Seocho-gu...

1377
00:44:56,280 --> 00:44:58,550
should go to the 2nd and 3rd child.

1378
00:44:58,550 --> 00:45:02,980
The pet armandidorang...

1379
00:45:04,150 --> 00:45:05,880
(This is a disaster.)

1380
00:45:05,880 --> 00:45:07,480
The pet armandidorang...

1381
00:45:07,480 --> 00:45:08,980
and kissing gourami...

1382
00:45:09,230 --> 00:45:12,090
- should go to my nephew.
- What?

1383
00:45:12,090 --> 00:45:13,460
The nephew.

1384
00:45:14,420 --> 00:45:16,320
Yeo Been, you are acting strange.

1385
00:45:17,070 --> 00:45:19,730
Send them to my nephew.

1386
00:45:20,900 --> 00:45:23,770
Send the armandi
and kissing gourami?

1387
00:45:23,770 --> 00:45:24,880
And...

1388
00:45:24,880 --> 00:45:28,000
the rhino...
Wait, that can't be right.

1389
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:30,650
What was it? The rhino...

1390
00:45:31,070 --> 00:45:33,480
Well, the rhino...

1391
00:45:33,920 --> 00:45:35,090
It should be released.

1392
00:45:36,090 --> 00:45:37,690
- It should be released.
- Release it.

1393
00:45:37,690 --> 00:45:39,110
(Release the rhino!)

1394
00:45:39,820 --> 00:45:42,960
What kind of nonsense is that?

1395
00:45:43,150 --> 00:45:45,030
- I don't know...
- Release the rhino?

1396
00:45:45,030 --> 00:45:46,360
how this happened.

1397
00:45:46,400 --> 00:45:48,630
- What else can you do?
- That's right.

1398
00:45:48,630 --> 00:45:50,730
- But why would you release it?
- What else can you do with a rhino?

1399
00:45:50,730 --> 00:45:53,590
- That's the only choice.
- That's right.

1400
00:45:53,590 --> 00:45:55,360
- It's not like you can eat it.
- But...

1401
00:45:55,360 --> 00:45:56,460
(Kwang Soo to Haha)

1402
00:45:57,210 --> 00:45:58,380
Listen, guys.

1403
00:45:58,380 --> 00:46:00,670
- Is it a will again?
- How did you know?

1404
00:46:00,670 --> 00:46:03,170
(You startled me.)

1405
00:46:03,440 --> 00:46:07,710
- How did you know?
- How did you know?

1406
00:46:07,710 --> 00:46:08,780
Are you serious?

1407
00:46:08,780 --> 00:46:09,880
It's a will.

1408
00:46:09,880 --> 00:46:12,380
- The 142m² apartment...
- Listen, guys. It's a will.

1409
00:46:12,380 --> 00:46:16,090
The 142m² apartment at Seocho-gu...

1410
00:46:16,090 --> 00:46:18,960
- 23.
- What?

1411
00:46:18,960 --> 00:46:22,270
There was something about 23.
I am sure of it. 23.

1412
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:25,460
- The 142m² apartment...
- "The 142m² apartment."

1413
00:46:25,460 --> 00:46:28,960
- is on the 43rd floor.
- "It's on the 43rd floor."

1414
00:46:28,960 --> 00:46:30,030
Okay.

1415
00:46:30,400 --> 00:46:31,800
(The will gets mixed up again.)

1416
00:46:31,800 --> 00:46:34,670
The pet armand...

1417
00:46:34,670 --> 00:46:35,980
Armand?

1418
00:46:35,980 --> 00:46:37,610
Isn't that the name of champagne?

1419
00:46:39,380 --> 00:46:41,980
- Champagne?
- I am sure it's a brand name.

1420
00:46:42,420 --> 00:46:44,050
Armandor.

1421
00:46:44,050 --> 00:46:45,250
(He quickly changes the name.)

1422
00:46:45,250 --> 00:46:49,820
Send the pet armandor to my nephew.

1423
00:46:50,380 --> 00:46:52,960
- My nephew.
- Release the rhino.

1424
00:46:52,960 --> 00:46:54,230
(The last part of the will)

1425
00:46:54,230 --> 00:46:55,690
What?

1426
00:46:56,300 --> 00:46:58,360
(This person really wanted
to release the rhino in the wild.)

1427
00:46:58,360 --> 00:47:00,840
- This is crazy.
- That's exactly what I heard.

1428
00:47:00,840 --> 00:47:01,860
(I swear.)

1429
00:47:01,860 --> 00:47:05,210
Listen, guys. It's a will.

1430
00:47:05,630 --> 00:47:08,800
- A will.
- I give you...

1431
00:47:09,250 --> 00:47:12,880
the 142m² apartment...

1432
00:47:12,940 --> 00:47:14,210
(Haha gets that part right.)

1433
00:47:14,210 --> 00:47:15,320
(He is doing great!)

1434
00:47:15,320 --> 00:47:16,750
I don't think
it's on the 43rd floor.

1435
00:47:16,820 --> 00:47:20,750
I give you 23 142m² apartments...

1436
00:47:20,750 --> 00:47:23,920
(I give you 23 142m² apartments...)

1437
00:47:23,920 --> 00:47:25,860
(They finally found out
about the father's secret.)

1438
00:47:25,860 --> 00:47:27,730
Our father was a rich man!

1439
00:47:27,730 --> 00:47:29,360
- Seriously.
- Our father...

1440
00:47:29,360 --> 00:47:32,530
- Our father was a rich man!
- 23 142m² apartments?

1441
00:47:33,460 --> 00:47:35,070
That's insanely rich.

1442
00:47:35,070 --> 00:47:36,170
(Again, this is how scary
it is to spread words.)

1443
00:47:36,170 --> 00:47:39,630
I will give
the 23 apartments to you.

1444
00:47:39,630 --> 00:47:41,110
Inside them were...

1445
00:47:42,980 --> 00:47:44,820
a cat named Armand...

1446
00:47:44,820 --> 00:47:46,210
and kissing gourami.

1447
00:47:46,520 --> 00:47:49,590
Give them to the rhino.

1448
00:47:49,590 --> 00:47:51,280
(Give them to the rhino.)

1449
00:47:51,420 --> 00:47:52,550
(The rhino obtained
Armand and kissing gourami.)

1450
00:47:52,550 --> 00:47:54,690
Then the family will be successful
for generations.

1451
00:47:54,690 --> 00:47:55,780
I will reveal the answer.

1452
00:47:55,780 --> 00:47:56,880
What's the answer?

1453
00:47:56,880 --> 00:47:58,690
- The rhino...
- Is there a part about a rhino?

1454
00:47:59,530 --> 00:48:03,270
I talked about a monkey,
but Sora changed it to an elephant.

1455
00:48:03,570 --> 00:48:05,190
Then Jae Hong changed it to a rhino.

1456
00:48:05,190 --> 00:48:07,770
All right.
Since you failed the mission,

1457
00:48:07,770 --> 00:48:10,530
I will reveal a hint
on the reincarnated members.

1458
00:48:10,710 --> 00:48:12,480
If you are a deity of death,
take note.

1459
00:48:12,480 --> 00:48:15,440
The reincarnated members don't have
the AB blood type.

1460
00:48:16,110 --> 00:48:17,170
It's not me.

1461
00:48:17,650 --> 00:48:19,420
(The hint eliminates So Min.)

1462
00:48:19,750 --> 00:48:21,380
- That eliminated one member.
- Seriously.

1463
00:48:21,380 --> 00:48:24,420
For 10 minutes, we will play
the name tag elimination again.

1464
00:48:24,420 --> 00:48:26,920
A hint on the deities of death
is hidden somewhere in here.

1465
00:48:26,920 --> 00:48:28,130
- Okay.
- We have to find it.

1466
00:48:28,130 --> 00:48:29,420
Where is it?

1467
00:48:29,420 --> 00:48:30,650
(Where is the hint?)

1468
00:48:31,150 --> 00:48:32,630
You have to look for it.

1469
00:48:33,090 --> 00:48:36,000
(He outright asked
for the location of the hint.)

1470
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:38,670
- "Where is it?"
- Why would they tell you?

1471
00:48:38,670 --> 00:48:39,960
- You have to look for it.
- Are you okay?

1472
00:48:39,960 --> 00:48:41,300
- I feel dizzy.
- "Where is it?"

1473
00:48:41,300 --> 00:48:42,530
That was hilarious.

1474
00:48:42,530 --> 00:48:44,780
- Jae Hong, that was original.
- I feel dizzy.

1475
00:48:44,780 --> 00:48:46,500
"Where is it?" That was original.

1476
00:48:46,500 --> 00:48:48,380
He must be the first person
to ask that outright.

1477
00:48:49,900 --> 00:48:51,070
Let's go.

1478
00:48:51,070 --> 00:48:52,320
(The siren marks the beginning
of the name tag elimination.)

1479
00:48:52,320 --> 00:48:53,550
For goodness' sake.

1480
00:48:53,550 --> 00:48:55,190
- Let's look for the hint.
- Let's look for the hint.

1481
00:48:55,190 --> 00:48:57,590
- You are a deity of death.
- No, I am not.

1482
00:48:57,590 --> 00:48:58,590
- No?
- No.

1483
00:48:58,590 --> 00:49:00,380
- Is Kwang Soo a deity of death?
- Yes, he is.

1484
00:49:00,380 --> 00:49:01,380
He ripped off my name tag.

1485
00:49:02,030 --> 00:49:03,630
- For goodness' sake.
- I am serious.

1486
00:49:03,630 --> 00:49:06,030
- This is driving me crazy.
- Kwang Soo ripped off my name tag.

1487
00:49:06,360 --> 00:49:08,000
I am serious.

1488
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:09,960
- Whatever.
- Don't get fooled.

1489
00:49:09,960 --> 00:49:11,460
(Is Se Chan really not
a deity of death?)

1490
00:49:11,960 --> 00:49:13,400
(He spots something.)

1491
00:49:13,400 --> 00:49:14,590
What is it?

1492
00:49:14,590 --> 00:49:17,360
Hold on. Why is
the moving camera on me?

1493
00:49:17,570 --> 00:49:19,630
This is too much.

1494
00:49:19,800 --> 00:49:21,710
Why are there three cameras on me?

1495
00:49:22,050 --> 00:49:24,920
Everyone will be out to get me.

1496
00:49:24,920 --> 00:49:26,820
Kwang Soo, hold on.

1497
00:49:27,480 --> 00:49:28,520
I...

1498
00:49:28,520 --> 00:49:30,690
(Screaming)

1499
00:49:30,920 --> 00:49:31,960
What was that?

1500
00:49:31,960 --> 00:49:32,960
(They suddenly hear a scream!)

1501
00:49:32,960 --> 00:49:34,650
(It's a woman's scream!)

1502
00:49:34,650 --> 00:49:35,860
What was that?

1503
00:49:36,730 --> 00:49:38,590
- I heard someone scream.
- Hey.

1504
00:49:38,900 --> 00:49:39,900
What was that?

1505
00:49:39,900 --> 00:49:41,730
(They run towards the scream.)

1506
00:49:42,460 --> 00:49:43,500
Where did that come from?

1507
00:49:58,600 --> 00:50:00,600
- No way.
- Did you get eliminated?

1508
00:50:00,870 --> 00:50:02,600
(The person who screamed was Sora.)

1509
00:50:02,600 --> 00:50:03,700
(But...)

1510
00:50:03,700 --> 00:50:06,540
(she's holding a name tag.)

1511
00:50:06,540 --> 00:50:08,960
- My gosh, seriously.
- This is crazy.

1512
00:50:08,960 --> 00:50:10,100
- Hey.
- I guess I was wrong.

1513
00:50:10,100 --> 00:50:12,430
- Jae Suk eliminated her.
- He's the deity of death.

1514
00:50:12,430 --> 00:50:14,370
That means he's the deity of death.

1515
00:50:14,370 --> 00:50:15,710
I'm only holding my name tag.

1516
00:50:15,710 --> 00:50:18,370
- He's the deity of death.
- Sora is unbelievable.

1517
00:50:18,370 --> 00:50:20,180
- He's the deity of death.
- Everything happened so quickly.

1518
00:50:20,180 --> 00:50:21,810
- She took off her own name tag?
- Yes.

1519
00:50:22,080 --> 00:50:23,350
You're saying she took off
her own name tag?

1520
00:50:23,350 --> 00:50:24,910
But we ran over here
because we heard a woman scream.

1521
00:50:24,910 --> 00:50:26,180
What's going on?

1522
00:50:26,180 --> 00:50:27,580
My gosh, Sora is unbelievable.

1523
00:50:27,580 --> 00:50:29,390
(They're both busy
accusing each other.)

1524
00:50:29,390 --> 00:50:30,390
You're the deity of death.

1525
00:50:30,390 --> 00:50:33,770
I'm sure that a woman screamed.

1526
00:50:33,770 --> 00:50:34,890
- Yes.
- Yes, it was.

1527
00:50:34,890 --> 00:50:36,460
- But...
- But seriously...

1528
00:50:36,460 --> 00:50:37,890
My gosh, I'm lost for words.

1529
00:50:37,890 --> 00:50:39,770
Whoever screamed
sounded really urgent.

1530
00:50:39,770 --> 00:50:41,810
But if Sora's faking this,
it's actually really creepy.

1531
00:50:41,810 --> 00:50:43,140
- No, wait.
- Seriously.

1532
00:50:43,140 --> 00:50:45,270
I bet she screamed
because it wasn't Jae Suk.

1533
00:50:45,270 --> 00:50:46,500
- I swear.
- What's the matter?

1534
00:50:46,500 --> 00:50:48,770
- What's wrong?
- This is what people do...

1535
00:50:48,770 --> 00:50:49,980
- when they feel upset.
- Who was it?

1536
00:50:49,980 --> 00:50:51,980
- Why are you lying down?
- Let me tell you...

1537
00:50:51,980 --> 00:50:53,890
- what I think.
- It's not her.

1538
00:50:54,140 --> 00:50:55,390
- It's not her.
- Why?

1539
00:50:55,390 --> 00:50:57,020
I read the hint. It's not her.

1540
00:50:57,020 --> 00:50:58,080
Really?

1541
00:50:58,080 --> 00:50:59,350
(I read the hint. It's not her.)

1542
00:50:59,930 --> 00:51:01,730
- Really?
- What did it say?

1543
00:51:01,750 --> 00:51:03,250
- You saw the hint?
- I read the hint.

1544
00:51:03,250 --> 00:51:06,370
- What was it?
- The deities of death...

1545
00:51:06,370 --> 00:51:07,660
(He shares the hint he saw.)

1546
00:51:08,660 --> 00:51:12,040
My gosh, what's this?

1547
00:51:12,200 --> 00:51:13,210
(Jong Kook finds a hint
about the deities of death.)

1548
00:51:13,210 --> 00:51:16,330
"The deities of death aren't
any of the female guests."

1549
00:51:16,330 --> 00:51:18,270
(The deities of death aren't
any of the female guests.)

1550
00:51:18,270 --> 00:51:21,600
None of the female guests
are the deity of death.

1551
00:51:21,600 --> 00:51:22,620
(That means Sora and Yeo Been
aren't deities of death.)

1552
00:51:22,620 --> 00:51:24,520
It's not any of our female guests.

1553
00:51:24,520 --> 00:51:26,180
(It's not any of our female guests.)

1554
00:51:26,180 --> 00:51:27,180
(Then...)

1555
00:51:27,180 --> 00:51:28,180
Really?

1556
00:51:28,910 --> 00:51:31,980
- That means it's me.
- I knew it.

1557
00:51:31,980 --> 00:51:33,830
(I caught you,
you darn deity of death!)

1558
00:51:33,830 --> 00:51:35,480
- Look at him.
- I'm sorry.

1559
00:51:35,480 --> 00:51:36,500
What's the matter with you?

1560
00:51:37,200 --> 00:51:39,700
- It's these two.
- I'm sorry.

1561
00:51:39,700 --> 00:51:41,160
(Deities of death: 1. Jae Suk,
2. Kwang Soo or Se Chan,)

1562
00:51:41,160 --> 00:51:42,640
(3. And someone yet unknown)

1563
00:51:42,640 --> 00:51:44,200
- My gosh.
- There are two...

1564
00:51:44,200 --> 00:51:45,930
- Get lost.
- out of these three.

1565
00:51:45,930 --> 00:51:47,160
I swear it's not me.

1566
00:51:47,160 --> 00:51:48,430
- This is a misunderstanding.
- It's 2 out of these 3.

1567
00:51:48,430 --> 00:51:50,180
You guys are unbelievable.

1568
00:51:50,180 --> 00:51:51,710
That was such an obvious hint.

1569
00:51:51,980 --> 00:51:53,250
Jae Suk was...

1570
00:51:53,580 --> 00:51:55,810
(Earlier, when they picked
two more deities of death)

1571
00:51:56,580 --> 00:51:58,450
(The result of the draw)

1572
00:51:59,290 --> 00:52:02,480
(Jae Suk got picked
as the deity of death.)

1573
00:52:03,350 --> 00:52:07,080
(The picked another deity of death.)

1574
00:52:07,080 --> 00:52:10,560
(Who are the other two
deities of death?)

1575
00:52:10,850 --> 00:52:13,370
- The actual shoot...
- No, it's not me.

1576
00:52:13,790 --> 00:52:15,460
might be over already.

1577
00:52:15,620 --> 00:52:18,000
(Shush!)

1578
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:20,100
(The deity of death gets angry.)

1579
00:52:20,410 --> 00:52:21,560
Why did you hit me?

1580
00:52:21,600 --> 00:52:23,480
Are you kidding me?

1581
00:52:23,480 --> 00:52:25,230
The race is over.

1582
00:52:26,210 --> 00:52:28,370
My gosh, I can't believe
he was the deity of death.

1583
00:52:28,370 --> 00:52:31,750
Before we move on to Round Three,
let's pick two more people.

1584
00:52:31,750 --> 00:52:33,390
We're picking two more
deities of death?

1585
00:52:33,390 --> 00:52:34,890
I need more allies.

1586
00:52:34,890 --> 00:52:36,620
Because the same person
might get picked?

1587
00:52:36,620 --> 00:52:39,430
Yes, if the same person gets picked,
it won't count.

1588
00:52:39,680 --> 00:52:42,250
(They pick two more
deities of death who don't overlap.)

1589
00:52:42,850 --> 00:52:47,000
(With 2 more of them, now there are
5 deities of death in total.)

1590
00:52:47,200 --> 00:52:49,890
4 teams will compete in a team of 3
for the final mission,

1591
00:52:49,890 --> 00:52:52,370
"I'm Scared You Might Burst
If I Touch You."

1592
00:52:52,770 --> 00:52:53,910
Each team will take turns.

1593
00:52:53,910 --> 00:52:56,180
Two people will wear an air suit...

1594
00:52:56,180 --> 00:52:59,680
and explain a word to their member
using only their bodies.

1595
00:52:59,680 --> 00:53:02,950
And that member
needs to get it right.

1596
00:53:03,270 --> 00:53:06,980
Whoever gets more right will get
a hint on the reincarnated members.

1597
00:53:07,790 --> 00:53:09,140
- The reincarnated members?
- I see.

1598
00:53:09,140 --> 00:53:12,020
Please discuss which team
you're all going to be in.

1599
00:53:12,020 --> 00:53:13,390
Can't we just stick
to our old teams?

1600
00:53:13,390 --> 00:53:15,290
- Yes, good idea.
- That's a good idea.

1601
00:53:15,520 --> 00:53:18,000
But if we get something right,

1602
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:19,930
Jae Suk will also find out
about the reincarnated members.

1603
00:53:19,930 --> 00:53:21,730
Yes, he'll end up knowing.

1604
00:53:21,730 --> 00:53:23,640
Can't we just
leave him out of the game?

1605
00:53:24,200 --> 00:53:25,390
Let's just leave him out.

1606
00:53:25,390 --> 00:53:27,000
- That's nonsense.
- You're going to tell us who it is?

1607
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:28,060
How about this?

1608
00:53:28,060 --> 00:53:30,600
Let's put Jae Suk, Kwang Soo,
and Se Chan in one team.

1609
00:53:30,600 --> 00:53:32,270
- Yes, let's do that.
- Come here.

1610
00:53:32,270 --> 00:53:33,580
- Let's put them in one team.
- Then we'll know.

1611
00:53:33,580 --> 00:53:34,910
- What's going on?
- You're all in one team.

1612
00:53:34,910 --> 00:53:36,370
Why should I be on this team?

1613
00:53:36,370 --> 00:53:37,640
- I'm not it.
- Why are you...

1614
00:53:37,640 --> 00:53:39,250
- doing this to me?
- Good idea.

1615
00:53:39,250 --> 00:53:40,540
- I'm not it.
- How about we put Sora...

1616
00:53:40,540 --> 00:53:41,980
One of them is a deity of death.

1617
00:53:41,980 --> 00:53:42,980
- Yes.
- Yes.

1618
00:53:42,980 --> 00:53:45,290
I see you have your arm
around Se Chan's shoulder.

1619
00:53:45,290 --> 00:53:46,980
(You have your arm
around Se Chan's shoulder.)

1620
00:53:46,980 --> 00:53:49,080
(Does that mean Se Chan
is the deity of death?)

1621
00:53:49,080 --> 00:53:52,620
What is the matter with you?
Seriously!

1622
00:53:52,620 --> 00:53:54,000
What's wrong with you?

1623
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:55,370
You guys look so close.

1624
00:53:55,370 --> 00:53:57,700
I feel so close to you.

1625
00:53:58,160 --> 00:53:59,200
My gosh.

1626
00:53:59,770 --> 00:54:01,810
Don't let him fool you guys.

1627
00:54:01,810 --> 00:54:03,080
His face is red.

1628
00:54:03,080 --> 00:54:05,080
I really think it's Se Chan.

1629
00:54:05,080 --> 00:54:07,250
This is cute.

1630
00:54:11,250 --> 00:54:12,890
Who is this?

1631
00:54:12,890 --> 00:54:15,710
(Why is she suddenly hugging him?)

1632
00:54:15,710 --> 00:54:17,210
What's wrong with you, So Min?

1633
00:54:17,290 --> 00:54:19,750
The gorilla is so cute.

1634
00:54:19,750 --> 00:54:21,350
- What's with you?
- He's so cute.

1635
00:54:21,350 --> 00:54:23,200
I thought we were just friends.

1636
00:54:23,930 --> 00:54:26,460
- What's this?
- What are you doing?

1637
00:54:26,460 --> 00:54:28,520
(She suddenly kisses him.)

1638
00:54:28,520 --> 00:54:29,890
- You're so cute.
- Who was that?

1639
00:54:29,890 --> 00:54:31,290
- Will you cut it out?
- That was So Min.

1640
00:54:31,290 --> 00:54:32,810
- Hey.
- I'm just playing.

1641
00:54:32,810 --> 00:54:34,640
The gorilla costume looks so cute.

1642
00:54:34,640 --> 00:54:35,960
What's with you?

1643
00:54:36,080 --> 00:54:37,580
The bear is really cute too.

1644
00:54:37,710 --> 00:54:38,710
(She slaps him.)

1645
00:54:39,810 --> 00:54:40,910
(They're both cute,
but she treats them differently.)

1646
00:54:40,910 --> 00:54:41,910
Hey!

1647
00:54:41,910 --> 00:54:43,020
(They're both cute,
but she treats them differently.)

1648
00:54:43,020 --> 00:54:45,270
- Why are you hitting him?
- Why are you hitting me?

1649
00:54:45,540 --> 00:54:46,710
- The costumes look so cute.
- Kwang Soo, you're done.

1650
00:54:46,710 --> 00:54:48,390
- I'll get it right.
- You guys look so cute.

1651
00:54:48,390 --> 00:54:49,910
- They're cute.
- Okay.

1652
00:54:50,790 --> 00:54:51,890
Okay, go.

1653
00:54:51,890 --> 00:54:54,390
Ready, get set...

1654
00:54:54,390 --> 00:54:55,660
(How will they do as a team?)

1655
00:54:55,660 --> 00:54:56,700
Go!

1656
00:54:57,290 --> 00:54:59,930
(First quiz: Heat pack)

1657
00:54:59,930 --> 00:55:02,020
(They think carefully.)

1658
00:55:05,500 --> 00:55:06,500
(The bear and gorilla try to explain
in their own unique ways.)

1659
00:55:06,500 --> 00:55:07,710
What are they doing?

1660
00:55:07,710 --> 00:55:10,080
- What?
- He is a deity of death.

1661
00:55:10,180 --> 00:55:13,140
(They try so hard to communicate
with Jae Suk.)

1662
00:55:13,140 --> 00:55:15,450
It's cold? It's cold?

1663
00:55:15,450 --> 00:55:18,270
- Kwang Soo's pretty good.
- It's cold?

1664
00:55:18,270 --> 00:55:19,910
(Kwang Soo's pretty good.)

1665
00:55:19,910 --> 00:55:20,910
(Kwang Soo is proud.)

1666
00:55:20,910 --> 00:55:22,620
His hands are saying so much.

1667
00:55:22,890 --> 00:55:23,980
It's cold?

1668
00:55:23,980 --> 00:55:27,790
(He uses his cute bear paws
to explain the word.)

1669
00:55:27,790 --> 00:55:29,830
A heat pack?

1670
00:55:29,830 --> 00:55:31,460
(He gets it right.)

1671
00:55:31,730 --> 00:55:34,000
(Second quiz: Rice cooker)

1672
00:55:34,870 --> 00:55:36,290
(He makes small movements.)

1673
00:55:36,290 --> 00:55:38,640
What? I don't get it.

1674
00:55:39,910 --> 00:55:41,710
- Rice?
- He's almost there.

1675
00:55:41,710 --> 00:55:43,100
- Stew? Is it stew?
- He's explaining.

1676
00:55:43,810 --> 00:55:44,830
A stew?

1677
00:55:45,270 --> 00:55:46,500
(The body language of a bear.)

1678
00:55:46,500 --> 00:55:48,640
- That's a no.
- He just crossed his hands.

1679
00:55:48,640 --> 00:55:50,480
He's so cute.

1680
00:55:50,480 --> 00:55:51,770
The bear says no.

1681
00:55:51,770 --> 00:55:53,140
A stew? A meal?

1682
00:55:53,520 --> 00:55:55,450
A meal? No?

1683
00:55:55,790 --> 00:55:56,790
A pot?

1684
00:55:57,160 --> 00:55:58,790
Hey, gorilla.
Will you do a better job?

1685
00:55:59,790 --> 00:56:01,890
Hey, you need to do better.

1686
00:56:01,890 --> 00:56:03,290
(Unlike the shy bear,
the gorilla is dancing.)

1687
00:56:03,290 --> 00:56:06,370
Hey, what is he doing?

1688
00:56:06,620 --> 00:56:08,290
My gosh, are you serious?

1689
00:56:08,290 --> 00:56:10,100
- He's so cute.
- Hey, polar bear!

1690
00:56:10,100 --> 00:56:11,460
- He's so cute.
- Explain!

1691
00:56:12,160 --> 00:56:13,500
Polar bear, explain!

1692
00:56:13,500 --> 00:56:15,600
(He can only count
on the polar bear.)

1693
00:56:15,600 --> 00:56:17,480
The polar bear is so shy.

1694
00:56:18,710 --> 00:56:20,910
(He's huge, but he's very shy.)

1695
00:56:20,910 --> 00:56:22,680
- Why is he so shy?
- Hey!

1696
00:56:22,980 --> 00:56:24,450
Will you please explain properly?

1697
00:56:24,450 --> 00:56:26,750
He's so timid and kind.

1698
00:56:26,980 --> 00:56:29,020
- That's not the polar bear I know.
- He's so cute.

1699
00:56:29,020 --> 00:56:30,890
Why are his arms so short?

1700
00:56:31,290 --> 00:56:32,520
Hey, polar bear!

1701
00:56:32,520 --> 00:56:33,980
(The polar bear struggles
outside of home.)

1702
00:56:33,980 --> 00:56:35,620
Move on to the next one.

1703
00:56:36,850 --> 00:56:38,730
You need to explain properly.

1704
00:56:38,730 --> 00:56:40,660
(The next quiz: Bidet)

1705
00:56:41,830 --> 00:56:43,660
You guys can work together
to explain the word.

1706
00:56:43,660 --> 00:56:44,790
(You guys can work together
to explain the word.)

1707
00:56:44,790 --> 00:56:46,460
Toilet seat!

1708
00:56:46,830 --> 00:56:49,000
Jae Suk is having a hard time
getting it right.

1709
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:50,600
What is it? I don't get it.

1710
00:56:50,600 --> 00:56:52,730
- Your costume is getting deflated.
- It's losing air.

1711
00:56:52,730 --> 00:56:54,480
(The polar bear looks
very discouraged.)

1712
00:56:54,480 --> 00:56:56,910
- It's losing air.
- Look at him.

1713
00:56:56,910 --> 00:56:59,620
Jae Suk, you just discouraged him.

1714
00:56:59,620 --> 00:57:00,620
It's okay again.

1715
00:57:00,620 --> 00:57:03,890
(He seems okay,
but at the same time...)

1716
00:57:03,890 --> 00:57:05,080
Look. He's looking down.

1717
00:57:05,080 --> 00:57:08,560
Hey! Chin up!
Hold your head up high!

1718
00:57:08,620 --> 00:57:09,730
Look at him listening to you.

1719
00:57:09,730 --> 00:57:12,560
He's trying really hard.
He's very kind.

1720
00:57:12,620 --> 00:57:13,890
- He's so cute.
- He's just a little shy.

1721
00:57:13,890 --> 00:57:17,390
(The polar bear is working hard
in a foreign country.)

1722
00:57:17,390 --> 00:57:21,160
(And today, he really misses
his family in the North Pole.)

1723
00:57:21,160 --> 00:57:23,100
Hey! Are you dying?

1724
00:57:23,580 --> 00:57:25,870
- Are you dying?
- It's okay now.

1725
00:57:25,870 --> 00:57:27,770
Hurry up.

1726
00:57:27,770 --> 00:57:29,100
What is it?

1727
00:57:29,620 --> 00:57:30,950
That's not it.

1728
00:57:31,020 --> 00:57:32,770
- Why are you guys kissing?
- Waist!

1729
00:57:33,290 --> 00:57:36,390
Waist! Hey, wait...

1730
00:57:36,390 --> 00:57:38,560
What are you guys doing?
Are you serious?

1731
00:57:38,560 --> 00:57:40,290
(They suddenly start
showing too much affection.)

1732
00:57:40,560 --> 00:57:41,830
What are you guys doing?

1733
00:57:41,830 --> 00:57:44,830
(He punishes them
for being too sexual.)

1734
00:57:46,290 --> 00:57:47,370
Come to your senses!

1735
00:57:47,370 --> 00:57:48,390
(Come to your senses!)

1736
00:57:48,790 --> 00:57:50,100
(We were too focused.)

1737
00:57:50,100 --> 00:57:52,660
- What do you think you're doing?
- This is so funny.

1738
00:57:52,660 --> 00:57:54,000
- Just move on.
- Next!

1739
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:55,810
- This one is so hard.
- How is he going to get this one?

1740
00:57:55,810 --> 00:57:56,830
This one is so hard.

1741
00:57:56,830 --> 00:57:59,270
(The next quiz: Instant glue)

1742
00:57:59,750 --> 00:58:00,910
My gosh.

1743
00:58:00,910 --> 00:58:02,870
(How will the animals
describe the word?)

1744
00:58:03,640 --> 00:58:04,870
What's this?

1745
00:58:05,950 --> 00:58:07,790
- What?
- What are they doing?

1746
00:58:07,790 --> 00:58:09,080
(The bear and gorilla stick together
and don't move.)

1747
00:58:09,080 --> 00:58:10,180
What's this?

1748
00:58:12,390 --> 00:58:15,390
(The polar bear is
looking far away,)

1749
00:58:15,390 --> 00:58:17,730
(and the gorilla has his face
buried in the polar bear's chest.)

1750
00:58:17,730 --> 00:58:18,750
What is this?

1751
00:58:18,750 --> 00:58:19,790
(The polar bear is
looking far away...)

1752
00:58:19,790 --> 00:58:20,930
What is this?

1753
00:58:20,930 --> 00:58:22,830
(They're glued together.)

1754
00:58:22,830 --> 00:58:25,040
- He really can't get this one.
- This is so funny.

1755
00:58:25,160 --> 00:58:26,540
- He can't get it right.
- Next.

1756
00:58:26,540 --> 00:58:28,040
This one is hard as well.

1757
00:58:28,210 --> 00:58:29,210
What is it?

1758
00:58:29,370 --> 00:58:30,870
Look at him.

1759
00:58:33,270 --> 00:58:37,180
(He uses his paws
to explain the details.)

1760
00:58:37,180 --> 00:58:38,910
(He tries his best to use his paws.)

1761
00:58:38,910 --> 00:58:40,680
- Eyes!
- My gosh.

1762
00:58:41,540 --> 00:58:43,750
- Eyes!
- This is so funny.

1763
00:58:43,750 --> 00:58:46,080
Glasses! Contact lenses!

1764
00:58:46,080 --> 00:58:48,230
- Contact lenses!
- Yes, he got it right.

1765
00:58:48,750 --> 00:58:50,200
- Great.
- That's it.

1766
00:58:50,200 --> 00:58:51,520
You guys got five right.

1767
00:58:51,520 --> 00:58:53,790
- That's a lot.
- We did very well.

1768
00:58:53,790 --> 00:58:54,870
Great job.

1769
00:58:55,000 --> 00:58:56,660
Next team, please choose one person.

1770
00:58:57,000 --> 00:58:58,160
What's that?

1771
00:58:58,390 --> 00:58:59,560
Tent!

1772
00:59:00,870 --> 00:59:02,430
- Car!
- No.

1773
00:59:02,430 --> 00:59:03,580
Motorcycle!

1774
00:59:05,210 --> 00:59:07,140
(So Min puts on the gorilla costume
and explains very passionately.)

1775
00:59:07,140 --> 00:59:08,180
Look at So Min.

1776
00:59:08,180 --> 00:59:09,750
(So Min puts on the gorilla costume
and explains very passionately.)

1777
00:59:09,750 --> 00:59:10,870
(Sung Oh is in a dinosaur costume.)

1778
00:59:12,270 --> 00:59:14,910
(Thanks to So Min's effort
to help him get the answers...)

1779
00:59:14,910 --> 00:59:16,020
Is she running?

1780
00:59:16,020 --> 00:59:17,290
(Thanks to So Min's effort
to help him get the answers...)

1781
00:59:17,290 --> 00:59:18,350
Fire extinguisher!

1782
00:59:19,080 --> 00:59:20,180
You got all 10 questions right.

1783
00:59:20,180 --> 00:59:22,460
- So Min did a great job.
- Nice.

1784
00:59:22,890 --> 00:59:24,600
Great job.

1785
00:59:24,620 --> 00:59:27,390
Will the winning team
please come forward?

1786
00:59:27,390 --> 00:59:29,960
- We'll give you a hint.
- Should we keep it from Sung Oh?

1787
00:59:30,290 --> 00:59:32,370
- Why?
- Never mind. Come on.

1788
00:59:32,390 --> 00:59:34,000
You can see it too. Great job.

1789
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:36,060
This is a hint
about the reincarnated members?

1790
00:59:36,060 --> 00:59:37,230
Yes, the reincarnated members.

1791
00:59:37,230 --> 00:59:38,600
(What kind of hint will they get?)

1792
00:59:38,730 --> 00:59:39,980
You're going to tell us?

1793
00:59:39,980 --> 00:59:41,540
Reincarnated members...

1794
00:59:42,270 --> 00:59:45,250
aren't among any of the younger
members of Running Man.

1795
00:59:45,580 --> 00:59:48,480
aren't among any of the younger
members of Running Man.

1796
00:59:48,480 --> 00:59:51,120
(The reincarnated members aren't
the younger members of Running Man.)

1797
00:59:52,660 --> 00:59:53,750
This is confusing.

1798
00:59:53,750 --> 00:59:57,460
(Then Se Chan and So Min aren't
the reincarnated members.)

1799
00:59:58,830 --> 00:59:59,890
The hint was given.

1800
00:59:59,890 --> 01:00:03,000
For 30 minutes, we will have
the final name tag elimination.

1801
01:00:03,140 --> 01:00:05,460
- 30 minutes?
- If you don't come to a conclusion,

1802
01:00:05,460 --> 01:00:08,000
we will open the stage where
the identities will be revealed.

1803
01:00:08,660 --> 01:00:11,180
Three members can go up the stage
at the same time.

1804
01:00:11,270 --> 01:00:12,810
If all three of them
are regular members,

1805
01:00:12,810 --> 01:00:14,710
the reincarnated members
and regular members win.

1806
01:00:14,710 --> 01:00:16,480
If even one of them is
a deity of death,

1807
01:00:16,480 --> 01:00:17,870
the deities of death win.

1808
01:00:17,950 --> 01:00:19,980
The reincarnated members
can use a special method...

1809
01:00:19,980 --> 01:00:21,850
to check the members' identities.

1810
01:00:21,850 --> 01:00:23,580
Each of them
can rip off one name tag...

1811
01:00:23,580 --> 01:00:25,520
to eliminate a deity of death.

1812
01:00:25,680 --> 01:00:28,180
If all reincarnated members are out
before the stage opens,

1813
01:00:28,180 --> 01:00:30,060
the race will end immediately.

1814
01:00:30,390 --> 01:00:32,500
Please go
to your designated spots...

1815
01:00:32,500 --> 01:00:34,160
before the race begins.

1816
01:00:34,160 --> 01:00:35,390
(They go to their designated spots.)

1817
01:00:35,500 --> 01:00:38,830
(Who are the reincarnated members
and deities of death?)

1818
01:00:38,830 --> 01:00:40,770
I don't know if it's Se Chan
or Kwang Soo.

1819
01:00:40,770 --> 01:00:41,960
Who could it be?

1820
01:00:42,960 --> 01:00:44,370
Maybe both of them
are the deities of death.

1821
01:00:44,370 --> 01:00:45,480
(Both of them could be
the deities of death.)

1822
01:00:45,870 --> 01:00:48,250
I need to know who
the reincarnated members are.

1823
01:00:48,750 --> 01:00:50,140
Who are they?

1824
01:00:50,250 --> 01:00:52,450
The one I think is
a reincarnated member...

1825
01:00:53,290 --> 01:00:54,520
is Sung Oh.

1826
01:00:54,850 --> 01:00:56,790
Sung Oh and Jae Hong.

1827
01:00:56,790 --> 01:00:58,660
(He thinks Sung Oh and Jae Hong
are the reincarnated members.)

1828
01:00:58,660 --> 01:01:00,250
(Walking around)

1829
01:01:00,250 --> 01:01:02,680
(Jae Hong is walking around.)

1830
01:01:02,680 --> 01:01:03,830
Sung Oh.

1831
01:01:03,830 --> 01:01:05,830
(Sung Oh enters the room.)

1832
01:01:05,830 --> 01:01:08,000
(Are Sung Oh and Jae Hong meeting
in secret?)

1833
01:01:08,000 --> 01:01:09,100
Sung Oh.

1834
01:01:09,100 --> 01:01:11,770
I should pretend to be
a regular member, right?

1835
01:01:11,830 --> 01:01:13,310
That's right.

1836
01:01:13,310 --> 01:01:15,310
No one is suspecting you.

1837
01:01:15,830 --> 01:01:18,310
Whose name tag should I rip off?

1838
01:01:18,310 --> 01:01:20,100
Then people will know...

1839
01:01:20,100 --> 01:01:22,250
that both of us are
the reincarnated members.

1840
01:01:22,600 --> 01:01:25,020
(Are both of them
the reincarnated members?)

1841
01:01:25,020 --> 01:01:26,450
(They had a preliminary mission
on the last week's episode.)

1842
01:01:26,450 --> 01:01:28,850
to the location of the members.

1843
01:01:29,540 --> 01:01:30,680
(Sung Oh's van)

1844
01:01:30,680 --> 01:01:31,960
(Ripping off)

1845
01:01:31,960 --> 01:01:33,790
Sung Oh,

1846
01:01:33,790 --> 01:01:35,580
you are out.

1847
01:01:36,180 --> 01:01:37,460
(But I haven't even gotten started.)

1848
01:01:37,460 --> 01:01:40,160
I was outside the van.

1849
01:01:40,160 --> 01:01:41,270
(He talks nonsense.)

1850
01:01:42,520 --> 01:01:44,230
(Jae Hong's name tag
got ripped off too.)

1851
01:01:44,230 --> 01:01:46,040
(What are you doing?)

1852
01:01:46,040 --> 01:01:47,210
I will put it back on.

1853
01:01:47,960 --> 01:01:49,060
What was that?

1854
01:01:49,660 --> 01:01:50,770
Am I out?

1855
01:01:51,180 --> 01:01:53,540
- What...
- You are a reincarnated member...

1856
01:01:53,600 --> 01:01:55,210
who came back to life.

1857
01:01:55,210 --> 01:01:58,810
(You are a reincarnated member
who came back to life.)

1858
01:01:58,810 --> 01:02:01,210
(Sung Oh and Jae Hong found out...)

1859
01:02:01,210 --> 01:02:03,520
(about each other's identity.)

1860
01:02:03,520 --> 01:02:05,290
There are more deities of death.

1861
01:02:05,390 --> 01:02:09,930
I will tell you how you can check
other members' identities.

1862
01:02:10,000 --> 01:02:13,290
Find the name tags
that are hidden...

1863
01:02:13,290 --> 01:02:15,120
in the building.

1864
01:02:15,120 --> 01:02:17,200
If you collect three name tags,
we will give you...

1865
01:02:17,560 --> 01:02:20,560
the number of the deities of death
out of the three.

1866
01:02:21,370 --> 01:02:22,370
- Out of the three?
- Yes.

1867
01:02:22,370 --> 01:02:23,430
We need three name tags.

1868
01:02:24,230 --> 01:02:25,980
From the number,

1869
01:02:25,980 --> 01:02:29,310
we can ascertain our guesses
and eliminate the deities of death.

1870
01:02:29,370 --> 01:02:31,540
I will rip off Se Chan's name tag.

1871
01:02:31,620 --> 01:02:33,290
- Really?
- Yes. I am sure it's him.

1872
01:02:33,410 --> 01:02:34,790
Then you should do it.

1873
01:02:34,790 --> 01:02:36,020
(Jae Hong is sure
Se Chan is a deity of death.)

1874
01:02:36,020 --> 01:02:37,080
This is too hard.

1875
01:02:37,580 --> 01:02:39,660
This is too hard.

1876
01:02:39,660 --> 01:02:41,330
(The race is too hard
for the reincarnated members.)

1877
01:02:41,330 --> 01:02:42,330
(He doesn't hide
that he is a deity of death.)

1878
01:02:42,330 --> 01:02:43,930
5, 4,

1879
01:02:44,430 --> 01:02:47,290
3, 2, 1.

1880
01:02:47,560 --> 01:02:49,160
The race starts.

1881
01:02:49,160 --> 01:02:52,460
(The race starts!)

1882
01:02:53,730 --> 01:02:56,060
The deities of death need to work.

1883
01:02:57,000 --> 01:02:59,370
(The official deity of death
goes to the members.)

1884
01:02:59,370 --> 01:03:01,100
- Tell me if you are reincarnated...
- Suk Jin.

1885
01:03:01,100 --> 01:03:02,680
- Go away.
- Please go someplace else.

1886
01:03:02,680 --> 01:03:03,750
Go away.

1887
01:03:03,810 --> 01:03:06,040
We don't want to talk
to a deity of death.

1888
01:03:06,270 --> 01:03:07,950
Jae Hong, are you
a reincarnated member?

1889
01:03:07,950 --> 01:03:09,120
I am a regular member.

1890
01:03:09,120 --> 01:03:10,560
- Go away.
- I am serious.

1891
01:03:10,620 --> 01:03:12,120
Do we agree...

1892
01:03:12,120 --> 01:03:14,060
everyone else except for Jae Suk
is a regular member?

1893
01:03:14,160 --> 01:03:16,180
Suk Jin is the one...

1894
01:03:16,180 --> 01:03:18,350
- who is the closest to death.
- What? Why?

1895
01:03:18,460 --> 01:03:20,330
- His age...
- Don't talk about reality.

1896
01:03:21,100 --> 01:03:22,930
Why did you suddenly bring up death?

1897
01:03:23,330 --> 01:03:24,660
He could be a deity of death.

1898
01:03:24,660 --> 01:03:25,930
What are you playing at?

1899
01:03:25,930 --> 01:03:27,140
- He could be a deity of death.
- You could die at any age.

1900
01:03:27,140 --> 01:03:29,000
- You can't...
- You could die at any age.

1901
01:03:29,000 --> 01:03:30,640
You can't make a guess that way.

1902
01:03:30,640 --> 01:03:31,910
(After exchanging curses,)

1903
01:03:31,910 --> 01:03:34,680
(Jae Hong is busy
looking for the name tags.)

1904
01:03:34,680 --> 01:03:37,120
(He finds the first name tag!)

1905
01:03:39,180 --> 01:03:40,250
(Yang Se Chan)

1906
01:03:40,250 --> 01:03:43,080
(It's Se Chan, the member
Jae Hong suspects the most!)

1907
01:03:43,080 --> 01:03:45,020
I want to find another one.

1908
01:03:45,020 --> 01:03:47,660
(He needs to find 2 more name tags.)

1909
01:03:47,660 --> 01:03:49,660
Would it be in here?

1910
01:03:50,020 --> 01:03:51,200
Keep looking.

1911
01:03:51,290 --> 01:03:54,100
(The crew wouldn't hide it
by the switchboard.)

1912
01:03:54,270 --> 01:03:55,330
There it is!

1913
01:03:55,370 --> 01:03:57,330
No, that's a prop.

1914
01:03:57,430 --> 01:03:58,640
Really?

1915
01:03:58,640 --> 01:04:01,710
(Sung Oh is bad
at finding the name tags.)

1916
01:04:01,830 --> 01:04:03,270
They hid them too well.

1917
01:04:03,270 --> 01:04:04,430
Sung Oh.

1918
01:04:05,270 --> 01:04:06,430
Sung Oh.

1919
01:04:06,430 --> 01:04:07,540
(What is he doing there?)

1920
01:04:07,870 --> 01:04:10,680
(Did she see me
looking for name tags?)

1921
01:04:11,120 --> 01:04:13,480
- Sung Oh, what exactly are you?
- What?

1922
01:04:13,480 --> 01:04:16,540
You could be a deity of death.
I'm confused.

1923
01:04:18,180 --> 01:04:20,520
- You are a deity of death, right?
- I...

1924
01:04:20,520 --> 01:04:23,020
How could you ask me that
so suddenly?

1925
01:04:23,120 --> 01:04:24,560
- Seriously.
- I am a regular member.

1926
01:04:24,730 --> 01:04:26,000
- Me too.
- Really?

1927
01:04:26,000 --> 01:04:27,100
(Everyone claims to be
a regular member.)

1928
01:04:27,100 --> 01:04:28,120
What are you?

1929
01:04:28,330 --> 01:04:30,370
Here is what I figured out.

1930
01:04:30,660 --> 01:04:32,100
The production crew assigned...

1931
01:04:32,140 --> 01:04:34,140
the reincarnated members,
deities of death,

1932
01:04:34,310 --> 01:04:35,560
and something else.

1933
01:04:38,080 --> 01:04:40,140
(Something else?)

1934
01:04:40,140 --> 01:04:42,750
We need to find the being
between the first two,

1935
01:04:43,180 --> 01:04:46,120
Young Gu.

1936
01:04:46,120 --> 01:04:47,710
(He brings up Young Gu in haste.)

1937
01:04:47,710 --> 01:04:49,620
There is Young Gu
among the regular members?

1938
01:04:49,890 --> 01:04:52,580
(There is no way
Ji Hyo would fall for this lie.)

1939
01:04:52,580 --> 01:04:53,730
(She falls for it.)

1940
01:04:53,730 --> 01:04:55,620
That's what I figured out.

1941
01:04:55,620 --> 01:04:57,390
(Okay, I got her.)

1942
01:04:57,830 --> 01:04:59,560
If one of us
is a deity of death...

1943
01:05:00,330 --> 01:05:02,890
So we need to find the link.

1944
01:05:03,060 --> 01:05:05,730
Let's hide first.

1945
01:05:06,140 --> 01:05:08,460
There are cameramen.
We can't hide by ourselves.

1946
01:05:09,500 --> 01:05:12,270
(Will you have a meeting
without the cameras?)

1947
01:05:13,910 --> 01:05:14,980
My kids do that.

1948
01:05:14,980 --> 01:05:16,040
(I thought I could hide
by myself.)

1949
01:05:16,040 --> 01:05:17,950
My kids hide their faces
and tell me to look for them.

1950
01:05:19,480 --> 01:05:20,640
So Min!

1951
01:05:20,910 --> 01:05:22,850
- Listen to me for a second.
- Did you figure something out?

1952
01:05:23,310 --> 01:05:24,710
Be suspicious of Jong Kook.

1953
01:05:25,250 --> 01:05:27,750
- Be suspicious Jong Kook? Why?
- Be suspicious of Jong Kook.

1954
01:05:27,750 --> 01:05:29,290
- A deity of death?
- I think he corners me...

1955
01:05:29,290 --> 01:05:30,520
- because he is a deity of death.
- What do you mean?

1956
01:05:30,520 --> 01:05:32,120
- Why?
- He corners me too much.

1957
01:05:32,290 --> 01:05:33,700
The deities of death
know each other.

1958
01:05:34,700 --> 01:05:35,870
What did you say?

1959
01:05:35,960 --> 01:05:37,560
- What are you doing?
- What are you doing?

1960
01:05:37,560 --> 01:05:39,100
- What are you doing?
- I am recording. What did you say?

1961
01:05:39,100 --> 01:05:41,370
Why are you recording
when there are cameras everywhere?

1962
01:05:41,430 --> 01:05:43,060
Come on. What about Jong Kook?

1963
01:05:43,060 --> 01:05:44,830
There is a chance
Jong Kook is a deity of death.

1964
01:05:45,330 --> 01:05:47,210
That must be why he corners me.

1965
01:05:49,310 --> 01:05:50,640
You recorded it...

1966
01:05:50,640 --> 01:05:52,810
to see Se Chan
when you miss him, right?

1967
01:05:52,810 --> 01:05:55,410
(Is it for personal use?)

1968
01:05:55,710 --> 01:05:56,910
Right?

1969
01:05:57,020 --> 01:05:59,020
- So Min.
- So Min.

1970
01:05:59,020 --> 01:06:02,680
You are so weird on the show.

1971
01:06:02,960 --> 01:06:05,930
- A deity of death said this.
- What?

1972
01:06:06,700 --> 01:06:08,520
- He is a deity of death.
- He is.

1973
01:06:08,520 --> 01:06:10,640
- He is a deity of death.
- It's highly likely.

1974
01:06:10,640 --> 01:06:12,100
- He is a deity of death.
- Just look at him.

1975
01:06:12,730 --> 01:06:13,960
That's it.

1976
01:06:13,960 --> 01:06:16,430
Did you film this video
because you like him?

1977
01:06:16,810 --> 01:06:17,870
- Hey.
- Stop it.

1978
01:06:17,870 --> 01:06:19,540
There is no other reason to film it.

1979
01:06:19,540 --> 01:06:21,640
Why did you film it
when there are so many cameras?

1980
01:06:21,640 --> 01:06:22,980
- It's not like that.
- It's for personal use, right?

1981
01:06:22,980 --> 01:06:25,120
- She will watch it every night.
- She did it...

1982
01:06:25,120 --> 01:06:26,640
because she was embarrassed.

1983
01:06:26,750 --> 01:06:28,450
(Leave the personal agenda
out of this race.)

1984
01:06:28,850 --> 01:06:32,080
(Jae Hong, a reincarnated member,
is looking for the name tags.)

1985
01:06:32,080 --> 01:06:33,180
There it is!

1986
01:06:33,520 --> 01:06:36,120
(He finds the second name tag!)

1987
01:06:37,020 --> 01:06:38,700
(Jeon Yeo Been)

1988
01:06:38,700 --> 01:06:40,560
(He obtains Yeo Been's name tag!)

1989
01:06:41,160 --> 01:06:43,100
(He continues
to look for the name tags.)

1990
01:06:44,500 --> 01:06:46,960
(He finds the third name tag!)

1991
01:06:49,230 --> 01:06:50,330
I collected three name tags.

1992
01:06:50,330 --> 01:06:52,230
If you collect three name tags,
we will give you...

1993
01:06:52,230 --> 01:06:55,040
the number of the deities of death
out of the three.

1994
01:06:55,140 --> 01:06:57,040
How many deities of death...

1995
01:06:57,040 --> 01:06:58,210
The number is...

1996
01:06:58,310 --> 01:07:00,040
(Among the three of them,)

1997
01:07:00,040 --> 01:07:04,250
(how many deities of death exist?)

1998
01:07:05,460 --> 01:07:07,330
- 1.
- 1?

1999
01:07:09,060 --> 01:07:13,230
(Among the 3 of them,
1 deity of death exists.)

2000
01:07:14,100 --> 01:07:16,160
I will rip off Se Chan's name tag.

2001
01:07:16,330 --> 01:07:17,930
- Really?
- Yes. I am sure it's him.

2002
01:07:18,140 --> 01:07:19,460
Then you should do it.

2003
01:07:19,640 --> 01:07:20,770
You must know.

2004
01:07:20,930 --> 01:07:22,060
- Know what?
- My identity.

2005
01:07:22,270 --> 01:07:23,370
Of course, I do.

2006
01:07:24,080 --> 01:07:25,210
You are a deity of death.

2007
01:07:25,310 --> 01:07:26,910
This is driving me crazy.

2008
01:07:26,980 --> 01:07:28,410
You are scaring me.

2009
01:07:28,410 --> 01:07:29,750
Go rip off someone's name tag.

2010
01:07:29,810 --> 01:07:31,810
- Seriously.
- If you are wrong...

2011
01:07:31,810 --> 01:07:33,850
Right now, I should be...

2012
01:07:34,410 --> 01:07:36,140
- What was that?
- Why did you rip off my name tag?

2013
01:07:36,750 --> 01:07:38,080
(Jong Kook's name tag...)

2014
01:07:38,080 --> 01:07:41,680
(gets ripped off!)

2015
01:07:42,250 --> 01:07:44,060
- What was that?
- Why did you rip off my name tag?

2016
01:07:44,060 --> 01:07:45,250
(What is going on?)

2017
01:07:45,700 --> 01:07:46,960
Why did you rip off my name tag?

2018
01:07:47,020 --> 01:07:48,290
Why did you rip off my name tag?

2019
01:07:48,520 --> 01:07:49,790
(He hasn't figured out
what's going on.)

2020
01:07:49,790 --> 01:07:50,890
I will get...

2021
01:07:51,290 --> 01:07:52,430
- What?
- I will get another badge.

2022
01:07:52,430 --> 01:07:54,100
(And)

2023
01:07:54,370 --> 01:07:55,540
Why did you rip off my name tag?

2024
01:07:56,730 --> 01:07:59,710
(She rips off Se Chan's name tag
as well.)

2025
01:07:59,730 --> 01:08:01,100
You can only rip off one name tag.

2026
01:08:01,100 --> 01:08:02,210
What was that?

2027
01:08:02,250 --> 01:08:03,680
You can't rip off two name tags.

2028
01:08:03,810 --> 01:08:04,950
What is going on?

2029
01:08:04,950 --> 01:08:06,140
(Sora ripped off two name tags
in an instant.)

2030
01:08:06,140 --> 01:08:07,290
Sora.

2031
01:08:07,290 --> 01:08:09,540
What is going on?
Did someone rip off a name tag?

2032
01:08:09,680 --> 01:08:11,660
- What is going on?
- I don't know!

2033
01:08:11,660 --> 01:08:13,830
I thought she was a ghost!

2034
01:08:14,730 --> 01:08:16,560
I peed my pants a little!

2035
01:08:16,660 --> 01:08:17,730
- What is going on?
- What did you do?

2036
01:08:17,730 --> 01:08:19,160
I was getting a bit bored.

2037
01:08:19,160 --> 01:08:20,200
- What does that mean?
- Are you a deity of death?

2038
01:08:20,200 --> 01:08:21,460
(What is Sora?)

2039
01:08:22,200 --> 01:08:24,730
(Sora was a regular member
at this point.)

2040
01:08:26,330 --> 01:08:28,370
(Before Round 3,
more deities of death were picked.)

2041
01:08:28,460 --> 01:08:30,100
(Kang Sora)

2042
01:08:30,100 --> 01:08:32,270
(Sora became a deity of death.)

2043
01:08:32,580 --> 01:08:34,750
I might as well rip off name tags.
There isn't much time.

2044
01:08:36,670 --> 01:08:38,770
- This has never happened before.
- This is insane.

2045
01:08:38,770 --> 01:08:39,950
I was just standing still.

2046
01:08:40,170 --> 01:08:42,180
- This is crazy! So you know now!
- Who eliminated them?

2047
01:08:42,180 --> 01:08:43,250
Who eliminated them?

2048
01:08:43,250 --> 01:08:45,510
- Sora ripped off my name tag.
- That means he is a regular member.

2049
01:08:45,510 --> 01:08:46,760
(Se Chan is a regular member.)

2050
01:08:47,760 --> 01:08:49,020
- Kwang Soo.
- That means he is a deity of death.

2051
01:08:49,020 --> 01:08:50,660
- Kwang Soo is it.
- He is a deity of death.

2052
01:08:50,660 --> 01:08:52,200
He is a deity of death.

2053
01:08:52,200 --> 01:08:54,020
(Kwang Soo is a deity of death.)

2054
01:08:54,020 --> 01:08:55,970
- Hey, you!
- For goodness' sake!

2055
01:08:56,020 --> 01:08:57,630
- Hey!
- That's not how you play!

2056
01:08:57,970 --> 01:08:59,700
- Why did you do that?
- That's not how you play!

2057
01:08:59,970 --> 01:09:01,100
Sora!

2058
01:09:01,100 --> 01:09:02,230
(I made so much effort.)

2059
01:09:02,730 --> 01:09:04,010
Do you want to be a deity of death?

2060
01:09:04,130 --> 01:09:05,630
- I would feel more comfortable.
- Okay.

2061
01:09:05,770 --> 01:09:07,450
(Testing)

2062
01:09:07,580 --> 01:09:09,470
- What are you?
- I am a reincarnated member.

2063
01:09:09,470 --> 01:09:10,580
(He sounds Kwang Soo out.)

2064
01:09:11,770 --> 01:09:12,920
Really?

2065
01:09:13,550 --> 01:09:14,790
Hold on.

2066
01:09:14,840 --> 01:09:16,180
Hold on. I was lying.

2067
01:09:16,180 --> 01:09:17,850
I was lying.

2068
01:09:17,960 --> 01:09:19,090
I was lying.

2069
01:09:19,160 --> 01:09:20,330
I am...

2070
01:09:20,330 --> 01:09:21,680
(Kwang Soo thought
Se Chan was a reincarnated member.)

2071
01:09:21,960 --> 01:09:24,520
(He put the name tag back on.)

2072
01:09:25,520 --> 01:09:26,800
- Hey!
- Things were going too slow!

2073
01:09:26,800 --> 01:09:29,870
Why did you rip off
Se Chan's name tag?

2074
01:09:29,870 --> 01:09:31,670
What were you thinking?

2075
01:09:32,040 --> 01:09:33,970
Sora. For goodness' sake.

2076
01:09:34,540 --> 01:09:35,710
I mean...

2077
01:09:35,710 --> 01:09:38,010
Jong Kook, I hate you.

2078
01:09:38,270 --> 01:09:39,540
Jong Kook.

2079
01:09:39,970 --> 01:09:42,170
Where are Sung Oh and Jae Hong?

2080
01:09:42,270 --> 01:09:43,510
I mean...

2081
01:09:43,600 --> 01:09:46,550
(Sung Oh and Jae Hong
are looking for the hints.)

2082
01:09:46,880 --> 01:09:49,180
Where are they?

2083
01:09:49,180 --> 01:09:51,810
Jae Hong isn't here either.
Where did he go?

2084
01:09:51,810 --> 01:09:54,480
Anyone who isn't here is
either a deity of death...

2085
01:09:54,480 --> 01:09:55,480
or a reincarnated member.

2086
01:09:55,480 --> 01:09:57,020
- I'm right here.
- I'm sure of it.

2087
01:09:57,020 --> 01:09:59,090
- Those who aren't here...
- I'm right here.

2088
01:09:59,090 --> 01:10:00,590
- are definitely...
- Jae Hong isn't here.

2089
01:10:00,590 --> 01:10:02,390
either a deity of death...

2090
01:10:02,590 --> 01:10:03,930
- Or a reincarnated member.
- or a reincarnated member.

2091
01:10:03,930 --> 01:10:05,130
I'm sure they're here.

2092
01:10:05,130 --> 01:10:07,410
- Jae Suk.
- We need to get Jae Hong.

2093
01:10:07,540 --> 01:10:09,010
We need to eliminate Jae Hong
and Sung Oh.

2094
01:10:09,010 --> 01:10:10,880
- Hurry.
- Where are they going?

2095
01:10:10,880 --> 01:10:12,730
- Hurry.
- If we don't do it, we'll die.

2096
01:10:12,930 --> 01:10:14,270
We'll die.

2097
01:10:14,270 --> 01:10:15,770
- Let's go.
- We need to go together.

2098
01:10:15,770 --> 01:10:17,380
- We have to eliminate them.
- This is crazy.

2099
01:10:17,380 --> 01:10:18,380
Over there.

2100
01:10:18,380 --> 01:10:19,420
Someone's there.

2101
01:10:20,270 --> 01:10:22,420
(They find someone.)

2102
01:10:22,420 --> 01:10:23,590
This is crazy.

2103
01:10:23,590 --> 01:10:25,460
(Jae Hong is looking for a hint.)

2104
01:10:25,460 --> 01:10:27,460
(And they run toward him.)

2105
01:10:27,660 --> 01:10:28,920
They're running!

2106
01:10:28,920 --> 01:10:30,850
- We need to catch them!
- We need to catch them!

2107
01:10:30,850 --> 01:10:33,590
(They run after
the deities of death.)

2108
01:10:33,920 --> 01:10:35,090
Look!

2109
01:10:36,020 --> 01:10:39,390
(Jae Hong runs away
after he sees them come after him.)

2110
01:10:40,760 --> 01:10:42,410
(Jong Kook tries to help
the reincarnated member.)

2111
01:10:42,410 --> 01:10:44,130
Kwang Soo! Hey!

2112
01:10:44,130 --> 01:10:45,580
- Kwang Soo, eliminate him!
- Hey!

2113
01:10:45,580 --> 01:10:46,970
- Catch him!
- Kwang Soo, eliminate him!

2114
01:10:47,300 --> 01:10:48,970
You need to catch him!

2115
01:10:48,970 --> 01:10:50,080
Eliminate him!

2116
01:10:50,720 --> 01:10:52,420
(The deities of death
will win the race...)

2117
01:10:52,420 --> 01:10:54,120
(if they eliminate
all the reincarnated members.)

2118
01:10:54,880 --> 01:10:57,220
(The distance between them
keeps getting shorter.)

2119
01:10:57,220 --> 01:10:58,460
Go!

2120
01:10:59,160 --> 01:11:00,920
(1 of the 2 reincarnated members...)

2121
01:11:00,920 --> 01:11:02,130
Jae Hong, run!

2122
01:11:02,130 --> 01:11:03,180
(could get eliminated.)

2123
01:11:04,200 --> 01:11:05,390
Jae Hong!

2124
01:11:05,390 --> 01:11:07,300
(Jae Hong is in trouble,)

2125
01:11:07,300 --> 01:11:09,670
(and Se Chan comes to the rescue.)

2126
01:11:09,670 --> 01:11:10,700
Jae Suk!

2127
01:11:11,540 --> 01:11:13,200
(He starts defending himself.)

2128
01:11:13,200 --> 01:11:14,300
You darn deity of death.

2129
01:11:15,260 --> 01:11:16,970
- Come here.
- Jae Suk!

2130
01:11:16,970 --> 01:11:18,130
You darn punk!

2131
01:11:18,130 --> 01:11:19,170
Wait.

2132
01:11:19,170 --> 01:11:20,640
(Kwang Soo is outnumbered.)

2133
01:11:20,640 --> 01:11:22,300
- Be careful.
- I'll hold him.

2134
01:11:22,300 --> 01:11:24,120
Hurry. Do it.

2135
01:11:24,120 --> 01:11:25,470
(He quickly reaches
for the name tag.)

2136
01:11:26,950 --> 01:11:28,750
- Okay!
- Nice!

2137
01:11:29,090 --> 01:11:31,010
(Swift)

2138
01:11:31,220 --> 01:11:32,290
(Kwang Soo, the deity of death,
gets eliminated!)

2139
01:11:32,290 --> 01:11:33,850
Jae Hong!

2140
01:11:33,850 --> 01:11:35,880
Kwang Soo, the deity of death,
is now eliminated.

2141
01:11:36,920 --> 01:11:38,390
He was the deity of death?

2142
01:11:38,390 --> 01:11:39,800
- Yes.
- I'm so angry.

2143
01:11:39,960 --> 01:11:41,520
I almost had him!

2144
01:11:41,830 --> 01:11:43,260
Kang Sora!

2145
01:11:43,260 --> 01:11:44,340
(He's angry at Sora
for ruining everything.)

2146
01:11:44,730 --> 01:11:47,840
(Jae Hong and Se Chan succeed
in eliminating Kwang Soo.)

2147
01:11:48,510 --> 01:11:52,230
(Reincarnated Members,
Deities of Death)

2148
01:11:52,230 --> 01:11:54,250
My gosh, it must've been hard.

2149
01:11:54,250 --> 01:11:55,970
Seriously.
How did you two manage?

2150
01:11:57,310 --> 01:11:58,750
- Kwang Soo.
- Jae Suk.

2151
01:11:58,920 --> 01:12:00,380
What happened?
You didn't catch them?

2152
01:12:00,380 --> 01:12:02,140
- I got eliminated.
- You didn't get Jae Hong?

2153
01:12:02,140 --> 01:12:03,790
(He doesn't know what to say.)

2154
01:12:04,760 --> 01:12:06,510
(I can't believe you failed
to get his name tag.)

2155
01:12:06,660 --> 01:12:08,290
There's something I didn't tell you.

2156
01:12:09,160 --> 01:12:11,020
I could ask about three people.

2157
01:12:11,200 --> 01:12:14,520
And I asked about Se Chan, Yeo Been,

2158
01:12:14,520 --> 01:12:15,970
- and Suk Jin.
- How many are there?

2159
01:12:15,970 --> 01:12:18,630
Out of those 3 people,
1 of them is a deity of death.

2160
01:12:18,630 --> 01:12:20,000
So two people are innocent.

2161
01:12:20,000 --> 01:12:22,630
- It's either Yeo Been or Suk Jin.
- One of them is innocent.

2162
01:12:22,630 --> 01:12:23,670
(Other than Se Chan, who was proven
to be a normal person...)

2163
01:12:24,130 --> 01:12:26,770
- Yeo Been, what are you?
- Yes?

2164
01:12:27,410 --> 01:12:29,100
- What are you?
- What about you?

2165
01:12:29,100 --> 01:12:30,670
- What are you?
- You tell me first.

2166
01:12:30,810 --> 01:12:32,250
What are you, Suk Jin?

2167
01:12:32,250 --> 01:12:33,720
I'm just a normal person.

2168
01:12:33,720 --> 01:12:35,090
- Really?
- Yes.

2169
01:12:35,090 --> 01:12:36,340
Should we go together?

2170
01:12:37,220 --> 01:12:38,380
Sure.

2171
01:12:38,380 --> 01:12:39,920
(Which one is the hidden
deity of death?)

2172
01:12:42,350 --> 01:12:43,660
I can't believe you attacked me
from behind.

2173
01:12:43,660 --> 01:12:46,020
Suk Jin ripped off my name tag!

2174
01:12:46,020 --> 01:12:47,520
Here's a penalty badge for you.

2175
01:12:48,000 --> 01:12:50,800
(Suk Jin's name tag is torn off.)

2176
01:12:51,230 --> 01:12:53,390
- Yeo Been is a deity of death!
- Suk Jin tried to eliminate me!

2177
01:12:53,390 --> 01:12:54,870
- Yeo Been took off my name tag!
- Suk Jin ripped off my nametag!

2178
01:12:54,870 --> 01:12:56,430
- I'm serious. Stay away from him.
- Who did it?

2179
01:12:56,430 --> 01:12:58,300
- Yeo Been attacked me from behind.
- Stay away from Suk Jin.

2180
01:12:58,300 --> 01:12:59,580
- Stay away from him.
- You're lying.

2181
01:12:59,580 --> 01:13:01,080
Yeo Been obviously
tried to take off his name tag.

2182
01:13:01,080 --> 01:13:02,340
She took my name tag off.

2183
01:13:02,340 --> 01:13:04,170
- She's a deity of death.
- I'm serious.

2184
01:13:04,170 --> 01:13:05,220
- She's a deity of death.
- Stay away from her.

2185
01:13:05,220 --> 01:13:06,340
Yeo Been is a deity of death.

2186
01:13:06,340 --> 01:13:07,680
- Yeo Been did this to him.
- Look.

2187
01:13:07,680 --> 01:13:09,450
- She did it.
- Take a look at this.

2188
01:13:09,450 --> 01:13:11,220
- He's putting on an act.
- Yeo Been is a deity of death.

2189
01:13:11,220 --> 01:13:13,850
- She's a deity of death.
- Yeo Been is a deity of death.

2190
01:13:13,850 --> 01:13:14,980
You're a deity of death.

2191
01:13:14,980 --> 01:13:16,380
- What?
- Yeo Been is a deity of death.

2192
01:13:16,380 --> 01:13:18,390
- She took my name tag off. Look.
- Really?

2193
01:13:18,390 --> 01:13:20,870
- It's Yeo Been?
- She attacked me from behind.

2194
01:13:21,130 --> 01:13:23,500
These three are
all deities of death.

2195
01:13:23,500 --> 01:13:25,040
- She took it off from behind.
- I'm just a normal person.

2196
01:13:25,040 --> 01:13:26,090
You saw that, right?

2197
01:13:26,090 --> 01:13:28,170
Right now...
Gosh, this is hard to tell.

2198
01:13:28,170 --> 01:13:29,600
Don't go near Jae Suk. Come here.

2199
01:13:29,710 --> 01:13:31,730
Sora... Sora's okay for now.

2200
01:13:31,730 --> 01:13:33,380
She can't take off any name tags.

2201
01:13:33,380 --> 01:13:35,140
- Suk Jin.
- I don't need anything.

2202
01:13:35,140 --> 01:13:36,840
- Stay right there.
- I'm totally fine.

2203
01:13:36,840 --> 01:13:38,010
- You stay there as well.
- Me too.

2204
01:13:38,050 --> 01:13:39,670
Stay there.

2205
01:13:39,750 --> 01:13:41,050
Wait.

2206
01:13:41,050 --> 01:13:42,480
- Is it him?
- Look at her.

2207
01:13:42,950 --> 01:13:45,180
(Yeo Been suddenly starts
running toward Jae Hong.)

2208
01:13:45,180 --> 01:13:46,680
- What are you doing?
- Let me see.

2209
01:13:46,680 --> 01:13:48,050
- What are you doing?
- Show me.

2210
01:13:48,050 --> 01:13:49,850
What's wrong with her?

2211
01:13:49,850 --> 01:13:51,220
- Hold her still.
- She's a deity of death.

2212
01:13:51,220 --> 01:13:52,520
Hold her still.

2213
01:13:52,520 --> 01:13:54,200
- Stay away.
- Stand back.

2214
01:13:54,200 --> 01:13:55,470
She's being weird. Look.

2215
01:13:55,470 --> 01:13:56,670
What is she doing?

2216
01:13:56,670 --> 01:13:59,430
I'm telling you!
She tore my name tag off!

2217
01:13:59,430 --> 01:14:00,930
- Exactly.
- So get over here.

2218
01:14:00,930 --> 01:14:02,630
- You're really scary.
- Stay there.

2219
01:14:02,630 --> 01:14:04,100
Suk Jin isn't a good actor.

2220
01:14:04,100 --> 01:14:05,730
- Hold her still.
- I'm so upset.

2221
01:14:05,730 --> 01:14:06,770
He really means it.

2222
01:14:06,770 --> 01:14:08,550
- Suk Jin is really angry.
- I'm so angry.

2223
01:14:08,550 --> 01:14:10,170
Yeo Been is the deity.

2224
01:14:10,840 --> 01:14:13,270
- We can't trust Haha either.
- We can't trust him.

2225
01:14:13,270 --> 01:14:15,180
Are you kidding me?
You're unbelievable.

2226
01:14:15,590 --> 01:14:16,790
So Min isn't safe either.

2227
01:14:16,790 --> 01:14:18,590
- I'm sorry. It's just for now.
- Let's go.

2228
01:14:19,880 --> 01:14:22,220
- The deities of death...
- Let's check.

2229
01:14:22,350 --> 01:14:24,920
- There's Haha, So Min,
- So Min...

2230
01:14:25,050 --> 01:14:26,200
- and Ji Hyo.
- and Ji Hyo.

2231
01:14:26,200 --> 01:14:28,200
- Go away, reincarnated members!
- Go away, reincarnated members!

2232
01:14:28,330 --> 01:14:30,200
- Go away, go away!
- Go away!

2233
01:14:30,390 --> 01:14:32,430
- We want to be treated fairly!
- Treat us like humans!

2234
01:14:33,560 --> 01:14:35,710
You guys get all the camera time!

2235
01:14:36,170 --> 01:14:38,210
We're working too!

2236
01:14:38,210 --> 01:14:40,210
Let us work!

2237
01:14:40,210 --> 01:14:41,910
- Let's go...
- That's the deity of death.

2238
01:14:41,910 --> 01:14:44,220
Don't come near him. Run away.

2239
01:14:44,770 --> 01:14:47,340
Yeo Been, we just got a hint.

2240
01:14:47,340 --> 01:14:48,480
Right?

2241
01:14:48,480 --> 01:14:50,590
We already know
that you're the deity of death.

2242
01:14:50,590 --> 01:14:52,460
(He lies to her.)

2243
01:14:53,550 --> 01:14:54,630
(Is she upset
because they're wrong?)

2244
01:14:54,630 --> 01:14:55,920
- Right? I'm a normal person.
- Yes.

2245
01:14:55,920 --> 01:14:58,020
- No way. You can't go.
- Can I go there now?

2246
01:14:58,020 --> 01:14:59,890
- Yeo Been, we already know.
- Let me go there now.

2247
01:14:59,890 --> 01:15:02,200
- No!
- Let me go!

2248
01:15:02,200 --> 01:15:04,230
- I'm going to go, okay?
- No way!

2249
01:15:04,230 --> 01:15:05,670
My gosh, what's with her?

2250
01:15:06,090 --> 01:15:08,170
- They trust me.
- No!

2251
01:15:08,170 --> 01:15:09,210
No, wait.

2252
01:15:09,210 --> 01:15:10,210
(Suddenly...)

2253
01:15:10,210 --> 01:15:12,710
- No, wait.
- Suk Jin can't be here.

2254
01:15:12,710 --> 01:15:14,600
- Hey, be careful.
- Watch out.

2255
01:15:14,600 --> 01:15:17,470
- Be careful. She's scary.
- Suk Jin can't be here.

2256
01:15:17,470 --> 01:15:18,470
Hold her tight.

2257
01:15:18,470 --> 01:15:19,580
(Ripping)

2258
01:15:19,580 --> 01:15:21,550
(Yeo Been's name tag
gets ripped off.)

2259
01:15:21,550 --> 01:15:22,550
Hold her tight.

2260
01:15:22,550 --> 01:15:24,310
(Sung Oh tears off
Yeo Been's name tag.)

2261
01:15:24,310 --> 01:15:25,510
We got fooled.

2262
01:15:25,680 --> 01:15:28,160
I'm not the deity of death.
It's not me.

2263
01:15:28,380 --> 01:15:30,590
Now, we know for sure.

2264
01:15:30,590 --> 01:15:32,660
- It's okay.
- That was a good guess.

2265
01:15:32,660 --> 01:15:35,560
(Is Yeo Been really
a deity of death?)

2266
01:15:35,560 --> 01:15:38,500
(Or is she just a normal person
who got framed?)

2267
01:15:38,700 --> 01:15:40,500
- Are you out, Kwang Soo?
- Yes.

2268
01:15:40,500 --> 01:15:42,230
- Me too.
- What?

2269
01:15:43,340 --> 01:15:44,880
Normal people
can also get eliminated?

2270
01:15:44,880 --> 01:15:47,130
(Yeo Been is a normal person?)

2271
01:15:47,130 --> 01:15:48,410
A reincarnated member
tore off my name tag.

2272
01:15:48,410 --> 01:15:49,970
- She's a normal person?
- We know the answer now.

2273
01:15:49,970 --> 01:15:51,580
Okay, we got it. Hey, Sung Oh.

2274
01:15:51,580 --> 01:15:53,450
- We got it.
- She's a normal person?

2275
01:15:53,640 --> 01:15:54,840
- Good.
- She's a normal person.

2276
01:15:54,840 --> 01:15:56,380
That means Suk Jin
is a deity of death.

2277
01:15:56,380 --> 01:15:57,960
- Suk Jin is a deity of death.
- It's him.

2278
01:15:59,590 --> 01:16:00,680
It happened a while ago.

2279
01:16:00,920 --> 01:16:02,420
(Ripping)

2280
01:16:03,160 --> 01:16:06,020
(Suk Jin tore off her name tag
while no one was looking.)

2281
01:16:06,830 --> 01:16:08,470
What are you?
A reincarnated member?

2282
01:16:08,470 --> 01:16:10,930
- I'm a normal person.
- Be quiet.

2283
01:16:10,930 --> 01:16:14,300
Suk Jin just ripped off
my name tag!

2284
01:16:15,130 --> 01:16:16,730
I can't believe you attacked me
from behind.

2285
01:16:16,730 --> 01:16:17,930
(Sora and Suk Jin
come up with a lie.)

2286
01:16:17,930 --> 01:16:19,630
(They make it look like his name tag
was torn off.)

2287
01:16:19,630 --> 01:16:21,880
Yeo Been took off my name tag! Look!

2288
01:16:21,880 --> 01:16:23,340
(He acts like he was the one
who got attacked.)

2289
01:16:23,340 --> 01:16:26,640
The race is over. Please gather
around in front of the platform.

2290
01:16:27,010 --> 01:16:28,840
You thought I was
a normal person, didn't you?

2291
01:16:28,920 --> 01:16:30,380
- Yes, totally.
- Right?

2292
01:16:30,720 --> 01:16:32,220
Everyone's gotten so good at this.

2293
01:16:32,220 --> 01:16:33,810
Suk Jin is a great actor.

2294
01:16:33,810 --> 01:16:34,980
He was a deity of death?

2295
01:16:34,980 --> 01:16:36,050
Seriously.

2296
01:16:36,330 --> 01:16:38,590
The race is finally over.

2297
01:16:38,590 --> 01:16:41,090
However, the reincarnated members
are still alive.

2298
01:16:41,090 --> 01:16:44,700
The reincarnated members
can discuss with each other...

2299
01:16:44,700 --> 01:16:47,040
and put three people
on the platform.

2300
01:16:47,040 --> 01:16:50,410
- Three people?
- Reincarnated members will lose...

2301
01:16:50,730 --> 01:16:51,840
if they pick a deity of death.

2302
01:16:51,840 --> 01:16:54,210
If not, they'll win.

2303
01:16:54,770 --> 01:16:56,840
We know for sure that Suk Jin,

2304
01:16:56,840 --> 01:16:58,450
Jae Suk, and Sora
are deities of death.

2305
01:16:58,550 --> 01:17:01,220
Now, we need to choose between
Haha, So Min, and Ji Hyo.

2306
01:17:01,220 --> 01:17:02,590
(The remaining deity of death
is among these three.)

2307
01:17:02,590 --> 01:17:04,680
- Who do we know for sure?
- But...

2308
01:17:04,680 --> 01:17:06,590
It's really not me.

2309
01:17:07,120 --> 01:17:10,380
- I swear it's not me.
- If you don't pick me,

2310
01:17:10,380 --> 01:17:11,500
you'll really regret it.

2311
01:17:11,500 --> 01:17:12,800
I don't care.

2312
01:17:12,800 --> 01:17:13,800
(Okay, I don't care.)

2313
01:17:15,870 --> 01:17:17,730
I want him to bet
his entire fortune.

2314
01:17:18,730 --> 01:17:21,040
We're going to draw
two deities of death.

2315
01:17:21,040 --> 01:17:23,410
(In the first draw,)

2316
01:17:23,410 --> 01:17:25,130
(her name didn't get picked.)

2317
01:17:25,380 --> 01:17:27,670
(And in the end,
her name never got picked.)

2318
01:17:27,670 --> 01:17:31,250
Why can't I be
the deity of death as well?

2319
01:17:33,170 --> 01:17:36,090
(She shows how upset she is
that he won't believe her.)

2320
01:17:36,220 --> 01:17:38,010
- So Min is a deity of death.
- I'm so upset.

2321
01:17:39,790 --> 01:17:41,290
(He starts accusing people again.)

2322
01:17:41,290 --> 01:17:42,760
- What?
- That came out of nowhere.

2323
01:17:42,760 --> 01:17:44,330
- He's doing it again.
- So Min...

2324
01:17:44,330 --> 01:17:45,960
- What's wrong with you?
- I'm really not it.

2325
01:17:45,960 --> 01:17:47,560
- So Min, stop lying.
- It really isn't me.

2326
01:17:47,720 --> 01:17:49,170
- It's really not me.
- You've done enough.

2327
01:17:49,170 --> 01:17:50,890
- I promise it's not me.
- This is so upsetting.

2328
01:17:51,200 --> 01:17:52,540
This is so upsetting.

2329
01:17:52,840 --> 01:17:54,060
I'm so upset.

2330
01:17:54,340 --> 01:17:57,260
Ji Hyo came downstairs
and asked me...

2331
01:17:57,260 --> 01:17:58,670
why I was all alone.

2332
01:17:58,670 --> 01:18:01,910
Then she told me what was happening
and warned me to run away.

2333
01:18:03,080 --> 01:18:06,950
Sung Oh, everyone's
gathered together right now.

2334
01:18:07,590 --> 01:18:10,620
If you're really
a reincarnated member,

2335
01:18:10,790 --> 01:18:13,550
you need to be careful.
They're all targeting you.

2336
01:18:13,550 --> 01:18:16,290
(Ji Hyo tells Sung Oh to run away.)

2337
01:18:16,290 --> 01:18:18,020
- Why are you smiling?
- What?

2338
01:18:18,020 --> 01:18:19,630
- I smiled? No, I didn't.
- Yes.

2339
01:18:19,630 --> 01:18:22,670
(He's suspicious of Ji Hyo because
she warned him with a smile.)

2340
01:18:22,670 --> 01:18:24,430
I feel like she lied to me.

2341
01:18:24,590 --> 01:18:26,000
I didn't lie to you.

2342
01:18:26,000 --> 01:18:28,230
And I didn't smile, Sung Oh.

2343
01:18:28,410 --> 01:18:30,010
My gosh, this is crazy.

2344
01:18:30,230 --> 01:18:32,130
- Are you done now?
- Yes.

2345
01:18:32,130 --> 01:18:34,010
We'll choose
after we hear your last words.

2346
01:18:34,010 --> 01:18:35,880
- I'm human.
- Why?

2347
01:18:35,880 --> 01:18:37,170
Because I'm human!

2348
01:18:37,170 --> 01:18:38,770
- That's it?
- Did you treat me like a human?

2349
01:18:38,770 --> 01:18:40,840
- Did you act like a human?
- You!

2350
01:18:40,840 --> 01:18:44,620
I stood by you when you were
being accused as a deity of death!

2351
01:18:44,920 --> 01:18:46,480
He's right. He stood by me.

2352
01:18:46,480 --> 01:18:49,050
(Haha was the only one
who trusted him.)

2353
01:18:49,050 --> 01:18:52,160
I was the only one
who kept saying you're innocent.

2354
01:18:52,160 --> 01:18:53,200
I feel so upset.

2355
01:18:53,200 --> 01:18:55,760
- It really isn't me. I swear.
- I feel really upset.

2356
01:18:55,760 --> 01:18:57,670
- I'd rather have humans lose.
- I'm really human.

2357
01:18:57,670 --> 01:19:00,340
I don't care if humans lose
even though I am one.

2358
01:19:00,340 --> 01:19:02,840
The reincarnated members
can have their final discussion...

2359
01:19:02,840 --> 01:19:04,710
and put three people
on the platform.

2360
01:19:04,710 --> 01:19:06,470
- Go ahead.
- Se Chan.

2361
01:19:06,470 --> 01:19:07,910
Okay, please step up.

2362
01:19:07,910 --> 01:19:10,010
(Se Chan gets chosen.)

2363
01:19:10,010 --> 01:19:11,810
- Jong Kook.
- Finally.

2364
01:19:11,970 --> 01:19:13,250
Finally.

2365
01:19:13,420 --> 01:19:15,310
I can't get soaked today.

2366
01:19:15,310 --> 01:19:16,680
- Me neither.
- Let's be a decent human being.

2367
01:19:16,680 --> 01:19:18,760
- You need to make...
- I'll just be a deity of death.

2368
01:19:18,760 --> 01:19:21,160
- the right choice as a human being!
- They've begun.

2369
01:19:21,160 --> 01:19:26,000
(Who will the reincarnated members
choose as their last pick?)

2370
01:19:26,720 --> 01:19:28,500
- Ji Hyo.
- Okay, step up the platform.

2371
01:19:28,500 --> 01:19:30,720
(The reincarnated members choose
Se Chan, Jong Kook, and Ji Hyo.)

2372
01:19:30,720 --> 01:19:33,730
I swear I'm not a deity of death.
How many times have I told you?

2373
01:19:34,040 --> 01:19:35,540
- Okay, then.
- You're mistaken.

2374
01:19:35,540 --> 01:19:37,100
Among these three people...

2375
01:19:37,100 --> 01:19:38,230
You still have time to cancel.

2376
01:19:38,230 --> 01:19:39,510
The deity of death...

2377
01:19:39,510 --> 01:19:41,670
Please! You still have time
to change your mind!

2378
01:19:41,670 --> 01:19:43,100
You still have time!

2379
01:19:44,450 --> 01:19:46,620
Among the three of you...

2380
01:19:46,620 --> 01:19:47,840
(They weren't certain.)

2381
01:19:47,840 --> 01:19:51,590
(What is the result?)

2382
01:19:52,460 --> 01:19:54,680
(Among the three of you...)

2383
01:19:54,680 --> 01:19:55,850
there's no deity of death.

2384
01:19:57,850 --> 01:19:59,720
(They did it! The reincarnated
members win the race.)

2385
01:19:59,720 --> 01:20:02,060
- See? Exactly.
- I'm sorry. I suspected you.

2386
01:20:02,060 --> 01:20:04,220
- No.
- I'm sorry.

2387
01:20:04,540 --> 01:20:07,300
And for your information, So Min
wasn't the deity of death either.

2388
01:20:07,300 --> 01:20:08,540
See?

2389
01:20:08,540 --> 01:20:12,040
Say that louder!
Tell them I'm a human!

2390
01:20:12,040 --> 01:20:14,910
Say that louder.
Tell them I'm a human. Please.

2391
01:20:14,910 --> 01:20:16,510
Please. Say that louder.

2392
01:20:16,670 --> 01:20:19,250
The reincarnated members
were Jae Hong and Sung Oh.

2393
01:20:19,250 --> 01:20:21,620
They were eliminated during
the preliminary round this morning.

2394
01:20:21,950 --> 01:20:24,310
As for the deities of death
who were chosen after each round,

2395
01:20:24,310 --> 01:20:26,880
Kwang Soo and Haha were chosen
after the first round.

2396
01:20:26,880 --> 01:20:29,260
- Jae Suk and Haha were next.
- Come on.

2397
01:20:29,830 --> 01:20:32,220
- You were chosen.
- Suk Jin and Sora were chosen...

2398
01:20:32,220 --> 01:20:33,720
after the third round.

2399
01:20:33,960 --> 01:20:37,130
I see. So you were a human too.

2400
01:20:37,130 --> 01:20:39,890
How many times must I tell you?
He just said that too.

2401
01:20:39,890 --> 01:20:41,260
- I'm sorry, So Min.
- Hold on.

2402
01:20:41,260 --> 01:20:43,630
(Heartbroken)

2403
01:20:45,080 --> 01:20:48,100
It's so weird. Whenever we get
the water bomb, it gets cold.

2404
01:20:48,100 --> 01:20:49,340
Is it frozen?

2405
01:20:49,380 --> 01:20:51,120
Suk Jin should give the stick
on our behalf.

2406
01:20:51,120 --> 01:20:52,120
- Me?
- Yes.

2407
01:20:52,120 --> 01:20:53,550
I'm sure you have
a lot of grudges against him.

2408
01:20:53,620 --> 01:20:55,120
Can I use the side to hit him?

2409
01:20:55,950 --> 01:20:57,790
- The side of the stick?
- Go ahead.

2410
01:20:58,680 --> 01:20:59,760
Is it today?

2411
01:20:59,760 --> 01:21:00,810
You, punk.

2412
01:21:00,810 --> 01:21:01,850
(He doesn't sound scary at all.)

2413
01:21:01,850 --> 01:21:03,020
Do it right!

2414
01:21:03,020 --> 01:21:05,300
It's about time
Suk Jin taught you a lesson.

2415
01:21:05,300 --> 01:21:06,800
- You need a good beating.
- How many?

2416
01:21:06,800 --> 01:21:08,590
You need a good beating.

2417
01:21:08,590 --> 01:21:10,830
I need an excuse
to hit him hard next time.

2418
01:21:11,890 --> 01:21:13,760
(Starting today, it's self-defense.)

2419
01:21:14,560 --> 01:21:15,600
You, punk.

2420
01:21:15,600 --> 01:21:16,600
(Repeating himself)

2421
01:21:16,600 --> 01:21:17,840
Do it right.

2422
01:21:17,840 --> 01:21:20,210
Hey, Suk Jin can be pretty strong.

2423
01:21:22,100 --> 01:21:23,210
(Striking hard)

2424
01:21:25,550 --> 01:21:26,640
(A loud striking sound)

2425
01:21:26,640 --> 01:21:29,420
That sounded like it hurt.
That was strong.

2426
01:21:30,950 --> 01:21:32,880
Come on, hit me harder.

2427
01:21:33,350 --> 01:21:34,880
It only offended Suk Jin.

2428
01:21:34,880 --> 01:21:37,020
Gosh. That was my full swing.

2429
01:21:37,020 --> 01:21:38,050
That wasn't so bad.

2430
01:21:38,050 --> 01:21:42,830
Anyway, I'd like to thank
the cast of "Secret Zoo."

2431
01:21:42,830 --> 01:21:46,800
I hope that your movie will be
well-received at the box office.

2432
01:21:46,800 --> 01:21:49,060
Thank you.
I hope your movie is a big hit.

2433
01:21:49,060 --> 01:21:50,130
I hope it's a big hit.

2434
01:21:50,170 --> 01:21:53,130
All right. In 1, 2, 3.

2435
01:21:54,710 --> 01:21:57,210
(Splashing)

2436
01:21:58,270 --> 01:21:59,880
(Splashing)

2437
01:22:00,340 --> 01:22:02,510
Good job.

2438
01:22:02,510 --> 01:22:03,510
Good work.

2439
01:22:03,510 --> 01:22:04,510
(We thank all the guests
for joining us.)

2440
01:22:04,880 --> 01:22:06,220
(Running Martial Arts School opens!)

2441
01:22:06,920 --> 01:22:08,130
(To become masters of martial arts,)

2442
01:22:08,130 --> 01:22:10,130
(four masters came
to attend the school.)

2443
01:22:10,920 --> 01:22:13,420
(The master of wind, Park Cho Rong)

2444
01:22:13,420 --> 01:22:14,970
(The master of water, Kang Han Na)

2445
01:22:15,670 --> 01:22:17,520
(But...)

2446
01:22:17,520 --> 01:22:19,670
(is there a possibility
of romance at school?)

2447
01:22:19,670 --> 01:22:20,890
(Did the students
follow their hearts...)

2448
01:22:20,890 --> 01:22:22,600
(and choose romance
over martial arts?)

2449
01:22:22,600 --> 01:22:24,800
(There's no time for that!)

2450
01:22:24,800 --> 01:22:26,800
(A secret trade of cards
in the back of the school)

2451
01:22:26,800 --> 01:22:28,910
(The master of fire, Keum Sae Rok)

2452
01:22:28,910 --> 01:22:31,050
(The master of tree, Lee Joo Young)

2453
01:22:31,050 --> 01:22:32,810
(Which one of them will become
a master of martial arts?)

2454
01:22:32,810 --> 01:22:34,080
(Running Martial Arts School:
Trade the Cards)
