1
00:00:00,770 --> 00:00:02,439
- Hello, you're here.
- Hello.

2
00:00:02,439 --> 00:00:03,810
- Hi.
- Hello.

3
00:00:03,810 --> 00:00:05,309
- Are you all right?
- How are you feeling?

4
00:00:05,309 --> 00:00:06,679
- He sprained his ankle.
- I've never...

5
00:00:06,679 --> 00:00:08,679
- Is it swollen?
- sprained my ankle...

6
00:00:08,679 --> 00:00:09,910
this way before.

7
00:00:09,910 --> 00:00:11,150
Is it swollen or not?

8
00:00:11,150 --> 00:00:12,779
The swelling isn't that bad.

9
00:00:12,779 --> 00:00:14,449
Let's not play soccer in this show.

10
00:00:14,689 --> 00:00:16,519
Jong Kook just gets carried away.

11
00:00:16,519 --> 00:00:17,789
(He can't hold back his desire
to win when he sees a ball.)

12
00:00:17,789 --> 00:00:21,089
In Running Man, I think a day
like today is a good chance for me.

13
00:00:21,089 --> 00:00:22,160
Because Jong Kook is injured?

14
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:23,660
- Today is the day.
- I just can't help it.

15
00:00:23,660 --> 00:00:24,859
Today...

16
00:00:24,859 --> 00:00:26,899
I don't know why we're
being like this. I know it's bad.

17
00:00:26,899 --> 00:00:28,800
- But I just can't help it.
- His upper body is just fine.

18
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:30,140
It's not like I'm dying.

19
00:00:30,140 --> 00:00:31,500
In fact, it's not a good chance.

20
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:33,170
You just can't beat him.

21
00:00:33,170 --> 00:00:34,969
This is crazy.

22
00:00:34,969 --> 00:00:37,340
You've got an invitation card.

23
00:00:37,340 --> 00:00:38,710
- What is it?
- Would you like to open it?

24
00:00:38,710 --> 00:00:40,039
- Isn't So Min coming today?
- So Min is coming.

25
00:00:40,039 --> 00:00:41,509
She's coming back today.

26
00:00:41,509 --> 00:00:42,909
So Min planned something.

27
00:00:42,909 --> 00:00:44,420
What is she doing now?

28
00:00:44,420 --> 00:00:46,380
- What is So Min up to?
- Seok Jin.

29
00:00:46,380 --> 00:00:48,320
- What's wrong with your face?
- What about my face?

30
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:49,890
Did you get hit or something?

31
00:00:49,890 --> 00:00:51,490
What's going on?

32
00:00:51,490 --> 00:00:52,789
I'm tired from yesterday.

33
00:00:52,789 --> 00:00:54,890
I was sound asleep on my way here.

34
00:00:54,890 --> 00:00:56,229
"What's wrong with your face?"
That's hilarious.

35
00:00:56,229 --> 00:00:58,060
- What happened to you?
- I mean...

36
00:00:58,060 --> 00:00:59,500
The thing is...

37
00:00:59,500 --> 00:01:00,670
Earlier today, Seok Jin...

38
00:01:00,670 --> 00:01:03,329
kept talking about his face,
but Jae Seok didn't care.

39
00:01:03,329 --> 00:01:05,670
And he suddenly started talking
about it as the camera is turned on.

40
00:01:05,670 --> 00:01:07,109
That's what I do.

41
00:01:07,109 --> 00:01:08,540
- Hey.
- Right. He didn't say anything.

42
00:01:08,540 --> 00:01:10,340
Why would I talk
when the camera is off?

43
00:01:10,780 --> 00:01:12,040
You're up anyway.

44
00:01:12,040 --> 00:01:13,609
- That's right.
- I know.

45
00:01:13,609 --> 00:01:14,709
You're so healthy.

46
00:01:14,709 --> 00:01:17,349
- I sprang up in my car.
- Okay.

47
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:19,480
It says invitation.

48
00:01:19,480 --> 00:01:22,420
"Hi, guys. I've got
a life-changing chance."

49
00:01:22,420 --> 00:01:26,019
"There's this fantastic land where
I can dig up huge diamonds."

50
00:01:26,019 --> 00:01:28,030
"The town even has
the Immortal Heart..."

51
00:01:28,030 --> 00:01:30,090
"which is the world's
most precious diamond."

52
00:01:30,090 --> 00:01:32,599
"Isn't it amazing? Let's go fall for
the charm of the diamond together."

53
00:01:32,599 --> 00:01:34,230
- What is this?
- It's like So Min's handwriting.

54
00:01:34,230 --> 00:01:35,230
(It's like So Min's handwriting.)

55
00:01:35,230 --> 00:01:37,340
What? Hang on.
What are you talking about?

56
00:01:37,340 --> 00:01:39,900
- It's obvious that it's typed out.
- It's just typed out.

57
00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:41,310
Just let it go.

58
00:01:41,310 --> 00:01:44,609
His eyes are all puffy.
Look at his eyes.

59
00:01:44,609 --> 00:01:47,510
Everything he says is fake.

60
00:01:47,510 --> 00:01:49,409
- Seriously.
- What's your true face?

61
00:01:49,549 --> 00:01:51,579
- I got goosebumps.
- Oh, dear.

62
00:01:51,819 --> 00:01:55,019
The person who invited you guys
is waiting in there.

63
00:01:55,019 --> 00:01:56,689
- Really?
- Isn't it So Min?

64
00:01:56,689 --> 00:01:58,219
- Isn't it So Min?
- You'll find out once you get in.

65
00:01:58,219 --> 00:01:59,219
It must be So Min.

66
00:01:59,219 --> 00:02:01,129
- Bo Pil wouldn't tell us yet.
- Stop it.

67
00:02:01,129 --> 00:02:03,030
We know that already.

68
00:02:03,030 --> 00:02:05,030
It'd be strange
if I pretended not to know it.

69
00:02:05,030 --> 00:02:06,829
You don't have to pretend
not to know about it.

70
00:02:06,829 --> 00:02:08,069
Just don't talk about it.

71
00:02:08,069 --> 00:02:10,370
It's stranger that you said
it's So Min's handwriting.

72
00:02:11,500 --> 00:02:13,000
It gave me goosebumps too.

73
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,710
I'm still half asleep.

74
00:02:16,069 --> 00:02:17,310
This feels awkward.

75
00:02:17,310 --> 00:02:19,710
It feels like
I'm starting all over again.

76
00:02:19,710 --> 00:02:21,879
It feels like the first day
I joined Running Man.

77
00:02:21,879 --> 00:02:23,250
(Who's the mysterious woman
waiting for the members?)

78
00:02:23,250 --> 00:02:24,780
What should I do? I'm so nervous.

79
00:02:25,150 --> 00:02:28,250
Why am I feeling nervous?
My heart is pounding.

80
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:31,759
(The members are slowly
coming to So Min.)

81
00:02:32,020 --> 00:02:33,159
They're here.

82
00:02:33,159 --> 00:02:34,759
(And So Min waits for them.)

83
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:37,159
(She tucks her hair
behind her ears.)

84
00:02:38,500 --> 00:02:40,699
This is it. So Min, why are you
sitting with your back against us?

85
00:02:40,699 --> 00:02:43,129
- So Min.
- Hey, So Min.

86
00:02:43,129 --> 00:02:44,699
(As soon as they get here,)

87
00:02:44,699 --> 00:02:47,210
(she goes over the top.)

88
00:02:48,439 --> 00:02:49,669
(What are you doing?)

89
00:02:49,669 --> 00:02:51,139
- So Min.
- Hey, So Min.

90
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:52,979
Have you been doing well?

91
00:02:52,979 --> 00:02:54,110
So Min's back.

92
00:02:54,110 --> 00:02:55,780
- It's So Min.
- So Min.

93
00:02:55,780 --> 00:02:57,520
(They are happy to meet again.)

94
00:02:57,520 --> 00:02:58,819
Hey, So Min.

95
00:02:58,819 --> 00:03:00,419
- You look much better now.
- You look healthier.

96
00:03:00,419 --> 00:03:02,889
- You look a lot better now.
- You look better.

97
00:03:02,889 --> 00:03:04,460
She really does.

98
00:03:04,490 --> 00:03:05,789
- Hey.
- You did something.

99
00:03:05,789 --> 00:03:08,030
Why do you keep drawing
your hair back over your ears?

100
00:03:08,430 --> 00:03:09,889
Women become prettier
when they are sick.

101
00:03:09,889 --> 00:03:11,629
- Is that it?
- Sure.

102
00:03:11,860 --> 00:03:14,199
- Hello. Hi, Ji Hyo.
- It's nice to see you again.

103
00:03:14,199 --> 00:03:15,770
- Have you been doing well?
- Yes.

104
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:17,139
So Min is back.

105
00:03:17,139 --> 00:03:18,340
It's so good to see you again.

106
00:03:18,340 --> 00:03:21,539
There are celebrities here.
They all are celebrities.

107
00:03:21,539 --> 00:03:23,370
- You guys look like celebrities.
- So Min.

108
00:03:23,409 --> 00:03:24,409
Your hair has grown a lot.

109
00:03:24,409 --> 00:03:25,710
Your face has got smaller.

110
00:03:25,710 --> 00:03:26,879
- I lost a lot of weight.
- Your hair has grown a lot.

111
00:03:26,879 --> 00:03:29,110
- You have hollow cheeks.
- All right then.

112
00:03:29,349 --> 00:03:31,250
You should say hello
to our viewers first.

113
00:03:31,250 --> 00:03:33,050
- It's been two months.
- It's been a long time.

114
00:03:33,050 --> 00:03:34,590
It feels really awkward.

115
00:03:34,590 --> 00:03:36,289
I didn't know
there were so many cameras.

116
00:03:36,289 --> 00:03:38,159
- It's always been like this.
- You just took a short break.

117
00:03:38,159 --> 00:03:40,560
- He's right.
- What are you talking about?

118
00:03:40,590 --> 00:03:43,259
So Min, you know we won't be
welcoming you like this for long.

119
00:03:43,259 --> 00:03:45,300
I don't want you
to pay attention to me.

120
00:03:45,300 --> 00:03:47,099
- I feel really uncomfortable.
- Just say hello then.

121
00:03:47,099 --> 00:03:49,969
Hello, everyone. Well...

122
00:03:50,340 --> 00:03:52,699
- Say hello to them.
- Hello.

123
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:54,969
- What are you doing?
- She feels awkward.

124
00:03:54,969 --> 00:03:56,569
- She's feeling awkward.
- Just say it.

125
00:03:56,610 --> 00:03:57,610
If you feel awkward like that...

126
00:03:57,610 --> 00:03:59,110
What's wrong with her?

127
00:03:59,110 --> 00:04:00,710
Those who are watching us...

128
00:04:00,710 --> 00:04:02,610
might want to change the channel.

129
00:04:02,909 --> 00:04:04,180
- They'd feel awkward too.
- Right.

130
00:04:04,180 --> 00:04:07,419
Hello, viewers. I'm Jeon So Min.

131
00:04:07,419 --> 00:04:08,419
(She says hello cheerfully.)

132
00:04:08,449 --> 00:04:11,259
I heard So Min has changed...

133
00:04:11,259 --> 00:04:13,289
- the course of her life.
- Is that true?

134
00:04:13,289 --> 00:04:14,330
I'm born again.

135
00:04:14,330 --> 00:04:15,490
Like how?

136
00:04:15,490 --> 00:04:17,329
- I think...
- It'd be fun to watch it.

137
00:04:17,329 --> 00:04:19,129
- It won't last for long though.
- That's not true.

138
00:04:19,129 --> 00:04:21,000
What's the change
in your mental attitude?

139
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,399
People don't change easily.

140
00:04:22,399 --> 00:04:24,100
I realized the importance
of my acquaintances.

141
00:04:24,100 --> 00:04:26,500
Now I can tell who truly loves...

142
00:04:26,670 --> 00:04:28,040
and cares about me.

143
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:29,410
Is that it?

144
00:04:29,970 --> 00:04:32,509
What has changed?
You just sound terrifying.

145
00:04:32,509 --> 00:04:34,180
- You mean people around you?
- Even in this group.

146
00:04:34,180 --> 00:04:37,350
In this small group, there are
people who care about me,

147
00:04:37,620 --> 00:04:39,279
- and...
- She has a list.

148
00:04:39,279 --> 00:04:41,420
- She has her own rankings.
- I told you before.

149
00:04:41,420 --> 00:04:42,420
She's got Death Note.

150
00:04:42,420 --> 00:04:46,120
I checked who called
or texted me how many times.

151
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:48,290
- Hey.
- The frequency doesn't show...

152
00:04:48,290 --> 00:04:50,259
how much we care about you.

153
00:04:50,259 --> 00:04:51,959
We just call you
on a periodic basis...

154
00:04:51,959 --> 00:04:54,529
only when we are
truly worried about you.

155
00:04:54,529 --> 00:04:56,170
- Sure.
- It's different.

156
00:04:56,170 --> 00:04:58,100
I also remember...

157
00:04:58,100 --> 00:05:00,769
who called me a lot at first
and let up later on.

158
00:05:00,769 --> 00:05:02,709
- I won't mention the names though.
- She's specific.

159
00:05:02,709 --> 00:05:03,810
Look at her.

160
00:05:03,810 --> 00:05:05,209
- It's interesting.
- I know.

161
00:05:05,639 --> 00:05:08,379
A certain someone called me
less and less as time went by.

162
00:05:08,779 --> 00:05:10,310
Are you looking at that person?

163
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:12,420
(So Min's eyes are fixed
on that certain someone.)

164
00:05:12,420 --> 00:05:13,579
By the way,

165
00:05:13,649 --> 00:05:14,949
Se Chan said the other day...

166
00:05:14,949 --> 00:05:17,959
So Min did all five things women do
that give men the wrong idea...

167
00:05:17,959 --> 00:05:19,560
- I saw it.
- to him.

168
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:20,660
You saw it? What did you think?

169
00:05:21,860 --> 00:05:24,300
(So Min did all five things to me.)

170
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:29,399
(So Min did all five things
that give men the wrong idea.)

171
00:05:30,399 --> 00:05:34,970
(Se Chan argued that's why
he ended up getting the wrong idea.)

172
00:05:35,339 --> 00:05:37,339
When did I do those things to you?

173
00:05:37,339 --> 00:05:39,040
- We can find it.
- You're mistaken.

174
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:40,209
- Everything was filmed.
- I never did those things.

175
00:05:40,209 --> 00:05:42,050
You did all those things
while shooting Running Man.

176
00:05:42,050 --> 00:05:44,120
- So Min, you did those things.
- What I did is...

177
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:45,279
just smile at him.

178
00:05:45,279 --> 00:05:46,750
But from his point of view,

179
00:05:46,819 --> 00:05:48,050
I must look like this.

180
00:05:48,050 --> 00:05:50,220
I've never given him
a big smile once.

181
00:05:50,220 --> 00:05:51,589
- This is driving me crazy.
- The thing is,

182
00:05:51,819 --> 00:05:54,529
he must look at me
through a filter or something.

183
00:05:54,959 --> 00:05:57,129
(Video assistant referee)

184
00:05:57,629 --> 00:06:00,800
(Sometimes, she acted
like a big sister.)

185
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:02,269
(Sometimes, she acted
like a girlfriend.)

186
00:06:02,269 --> 00:06:05,839
(Little by little, Se Chan
got used to this forced romance.)

187
00:06:05,970 --> 00:06:08,240
(So Min calls Se Chan's name
in a nasal voice.)

188
00:06:09,639 --> 00:06:14,279
(The video assistant referee
proves Se Chan's innocence.)

189
00:06:14,279 --> 00:06:15,579
Did you ask Se Chan,

190
00:06:15,579 --> 00:06:17,009
"Are there any guys like you?"

191
00:06:17,079 --> 00:06:18,420
- You did.
- Did you?

192
00:06:18,420 --> 00:06:19,750
You said, "Set me up
with a guy like you."

193
00:06:19,750 --> 00:06:21,949
I did, but I didn't say that
to you only.

194
00:06:21,949 --> 00:06:23,050
I said that to all the other guys.

195
00:06:23,050 --> 00:06:25,290
- But you did say that to me.
- I said that to Jae Seok too.

196
00:06:25,290 --> 00:06:27,019
Have you ever asked me,
"Are you up?"

197
00:06:27,019 --> 00:06:28,060
Have you?

198
00:06:28,490 --> 00:06:29,829
- I have.
- Right?

199
00:06:30,029 --> 00:06:31,699
Why did you say
you never did those things to me?

200
00:06:31,829 --> 00:06:33,899
- You did all those things.
- She did.

201
00:06:33,899 --> 00:06:37,199
- I say that to my friends too.
- Still...

202
00:06:37,199 --> 00:06:40,199
- You gave me the wrong idea.
- Of course.

203
00:06:40,810 --> 00:06:43,110
You guys appreciate each other
more now. That's what's important.

204
00:06:43,670 --> 00:06:45,339
(Teasing)

205
00:06:45,740 --> 00:06:47,009
- Of course.
- There he goes again.

206
00:06:47,009 --> 00:06:49,579
- There he goes again.
- There he goes again.

207
00:06:49,579 --> 00:06:51,350
- He's at it again.
- You know...

208
00:06:51,750 --> 00:06:54,490
Even when things are going well,
Haha can ruin everything.

209
00:06:54,850 --> 00:06:57,290
- He ruins everything.
- Definitely.

210
00:06:57,290 --> 00:06:58,959
Ji Hyo called you a lot, right?

211
00:06:59,220 --> 00:07:00,689
Ji Hyo...

212
00:07:00,689 --> 00:07:02,829
called me and texted me
really often.

213
00:07:02,889 --> 00:07:04,959
More often than anyone else.

214
00:07:04,959 --> 00:07:06,629
The funny thing is,
after the articles...

215
00:07:06,629 --> 00:07:08,329
about my break were published,

216
00:07:08,329 --> 00:07:10,970
we talked on the phone,
and she said,

217
00:07:10,970 --> 00:07:12,269
"So Min, why are you not here yet?"

218
00:07:12,339 --> 00:07:13,540
"When are you coming?"

219
00:07:14,410 --> 00:07:15,509
I thought, "Hold on."

220
00:07:15,509 --> 00:07:16,810
(Ji Hyo never checks the news.)

221
00:07:16,810 --> 00:07:18,480
I realized that Ji Hyo really
doesn't use the internet often.

222
00:07:19,009 --> 00:07:20,439
You should understand her.

223
00:07:20,439 --> 00:07:21,949
I called her six days ago,

224
00:07:21,949 --> 00:07:23,110
and she hasn't called me back yet.

225
00:07:23,819 --> 00:07:25,879
It's been six days,

226
00:07:26,379 --> 00:07:27,949
and she hasn't called me back yet.

227
00:07:27,949 --> 00:07:31,519
We even shot together after that,
but she hasn't called me back.

228
00:07:31,519 --> 00:07:33,759
Ji Hyo sometimes surprises me.

229
00:07:34,730 --> 00:07:36,589
But when you're sick,
she's really nice to you.

230
00:07:36,589 --> 00:07:38,129
- Right.
- When I injured my leg,

231
00:07:38,129 --> 00:07:40,199
I had to protect my cast
in the shower,

232
00:07:40,300 --> 00:07:41,670
- Gosh.
- and she sent me something.

233
00:07:41,670 --> 00:07:42,930
I thought you said
she helped you take a shower.

234
00:07:42,930 --> 00:07:44,069
Why would she?

235
00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:45,970
- Why would she?
- He did this.

236
00:07:45,970 --> 00:07:47,870
- In the shower...
- I mean she sent me a cast cover.

237
00:07:47,870 --> 00:07:49,740
I didn't understand what he meant.

238
00:07:50,370 --> 00:07:52,139
I mean a cast cover.

239
00:07:52,139 --> 00:07:53,680
- She sent it to me.
- "Turn around."

240
00:07:54,279 --> 00:07:55,649
She didn't help me take a shower.

241
00:07:55,649 --> 00:07:57,480
If you want Ji Hyo's attention,
you should get sick.

242
00:07:58,779 --> 00:08:00,449
- If you want her attention...
- She's like Nightingale.

243
00:08:00,889 --> 00:08:02,220
Can we talk about
the invitation now?

244
00:08:02,220 --> 00:08:03,689
- Oh, what is that?
- Oh, right.

245
00:08:04,220 --> 00:08:05,920
Who sent it? We can find diamonds?

246
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:07,389
The invitation is
from So Min, right?

247
00:08:07,389 --> 00:08:09,290
- Yes, that's right.
- Are you into fantasy now?

248
00:08:09,329 --> 00:08:10,730
- I mean...
- Hey.

249
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:12,500
- I saw this.
- What's that?

250
00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:14,399
This flyer...

251
00:08:14,399 --> 00:08:16,699
- What's that?
- This is why I called you here.

252
00:08:16,699 --> 00:08:17,839
- Read the flyer.
- What's this?

253
00:08:17,839 --> 00:08:19,339
- Gems?
- Gems are buried in the ground?

254
00:08:19,839 --> 00:08:21,610
Gujeon Village?

255
00:08:21,610 --> 00:08:23,370
"There is a village where
gems are buried in the ground."

256
00:08:23,370 --> 00:08:26,139
"Find the world's most valuable
diamond, Immortal Heart,"

257
00:08:26,139 --> 00:08:28,009
- "and your life will be fantastic."
- Really?

258
00:08:28,149 --> 00:08:31,019
If you think of a scarecrow
in a golden field,

259
00:08:31,019 --> 00:08:33,120
a village will come to your mind.

260
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:34,320
It's Gujeon Village.

261
00:08:34,649 --> 00:08:39,320
It is the only village in
the country where gems are buried.

262
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:42,029
There will be a local festival
this year too.

263
00:08:42,389 --> 00:08:47,000
Also, the world's most valuable
and mysterious diamond,

264
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,870
Immortal Heart, is supposed to be
buried in the ground too.

265
00:08:49,870 --> 00:08:52,470
That's why the village is visited
by so many people every year.

266
00:08:52,570 --> 00:08:54,440
Why don't you visit the village...

267
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:56,269
and try your luck?

268
00:08:57,240 --> 00:08:59,279
There are gems
buried in this village.

269
00:08:59,279 --> 00:09:00,379
Gems?

270
00:09:00,539 --> 00:09:01,779
So what is this?

271
00:09:01,980 --> 00:09:03,179
Simply put,

272
00:09:03,179 --> 00:09:04,950
it's a local festival.
The gems you dig up...

273
00:09:04,950 --> 00:09:06,549
- will be exchanged with money.
- Really?

274
00:09:06,549 --> 00:09:07,750
- With money?
- Do you mean real money?

275
00:09:07,750 --> 00:09:09,549
- Real money?
- It's supposed to be a bonanza.

276
00:09:09,620 --> 00:09:11,590
Yes, we're giving out cash today.

277
00:09:12,419 --> 00:09:14,860
- We can get cash?
- Can we have it?

278
00:09:15,230 --> 00:09:16,289
Yes, you can get cash.

279
00:09:16,289 --> 00:09:17,899
- Really?
- Really?

280
00:09:17,899 --> 00:09:19,029
I don't believe it.

281
00:09:19,029 --> 00:09:20,870
- These days...
- We can dig up gems?

282
00:09:20,870 --> 00:09:22,870
It's called the Immortal Heart.

283
00:09:22,929 --> 00:09:24,970
- I'm getting interested.
- Does this make sense?

284
00:09:24,970 --> 00:09:26,000
Let me see.

285
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,409
Since everyone is here,

286
00:09:28,409 --> 00:09:29,809
we prepared a nice brunch.

287
00:09:30,269 --> 00:09:31,309
- Really?
- Really?

288
00:09:31,309 --> 00:09:33,179
- Enjoy.
- As soon as we start?

289
00:09:33,179 --> 00:09:34,279
- We can already eat?
- It looks nice.

290
00:09:34,279 --> 00:09:36,379
- Look at this.
- It's salmon.

291
00:09:36,379 --> 00:09:37,950
- It's chicken breasts.
- It's my favorite.

292
00:09:37,950 --> 00:09:39,419
Thank you.

293
00:09:39,419 --> 00:09:40,750
Oh, my.

294
00:09:40,990 --> 00:09:42,120
This looks delicious.

295
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:43,519
- Thank you.
- Unbelievable.

296
00:09:43,519 --> 00:09:44,720
There are pizzas too.

297
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:47,360
They must be fresh out of
the oven. They look delicious.

298
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:48,929
- Let's eat.
- This is nice.

299
00:09:48,929 --> 00:09:50,159
- This is delicious.
- This tastes so good.

300
00:09:50,159 --> 00:09:51,799
This feels weird, right?

301
00:09:51,799 --> 00:09:54,700
I was taking a shower with
Seok Jin and Se Chan after soccer,

302
00:09:54,700 --> 00:09:56,370
and Seok Jin's showerhead
kept turning to the side.

303
00:09:56,769 --> 00:09:58,440
- He could just turn it back.
- Right.

304
00:09:58,769 --> 00:10:01,009
But he just followed the water...

305
00:10:01,110 --> 00:10:02,570
until his bottom almost touched me.

306
00:10:03,509 --> 00:10:05,179
He obviously wanted me to move.

307
00:10:05,809 --> 00:10:08,210
- He came so close to me...
- Seriously.

308
00:10:08,549 --> 00:10:09,710
instead of turning his showerhead.

309
00:10:10,379 --> 00:10:12,149
- He could just turn it.
- He didn't?

310
00:10:12,149 --> 00:10:13,419
He didn't.

311
00:10:13,419 --> 00:10:15,049
I'm disappointed in him.

312
00:10:15,049 --> 00:10:16,350
His body almost touched me.

313
00:10:17,490 --> 00:10:19,419
At his age, it's hard to change.

314
00:10:19,460 --> 00:10:21,259
It is.

315
00:10:21,259 --> 00:10:23,460
Unless he's born again...

316
00:10:23,830 --> 00:10:26,730
(Seok Jin can't refute.)

317
00:10:27,029 --> 00:10:29,500
I don't think he'll be born again
as a human.

318
00:10:31,570 --> 00:10:33,039
I want to be born
as a poisonous mushroom.

319
00:10:33,039 --> 00:10:34,110
Aren't mushrooms fungi?

320
00:10:34,110 --> 00:10:35,669
Why do you want to be born again
as a poisonous mushroom?

321
00:10:35,970 --> 00:10:37,210
Then I won't die alone.

322
00:10:38,940 --> 00:10:40,139
Then I won't die alone.

323
00:10:40,139 --> 00:10:45,720
(Creepy)

324
00:10:46,019 --> 00:10:47,889
- So Min hasn't changed a bit.
- I have.

325
00:10:47,889 --> 00:10:49,090
- She hasn't.
- I have.

326
00:10:49,090 --> 00:10:50,990
- Didn't you say you'd be different?
- It's not like that.

327
00:10:50,990 --> 00:10:52,720
Then you won't die alone?

328
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:54,029
She's become so mean.

329
00:10:54,029 --> 00:10:55,659
Everyone was quiet for two seconds.

330
00:10:56,190 --> 00:10:58,629
- You scared me.
- But she has a point.

331
00:10:58,629 --> 00:11:00,700
Ji Hyo, what do you want to be
in your next life?

332
00:11:01,529 --> 00:11:02,769
- Me?
- Yes.

333
00:11:03,830 --> 00:11:04,970
I want to be a rock.

334
00:11:04,970 --> 00:11:06,899
(I want to be a rock.)

335
00:11:06,899 --> 00:11:11,309
(Ji Hyo wants to be a rock
in her next life.)

336
00:11:11,309 --> 00:11:13,139
- A rock?
- I won't ask why.

337
00:11:13,139 --> 00:11:14,750
- It suits you.
- It suits you.

338
00:11:14,750 --> 00:11:15,809
A rock?

339
00:11:15,809 --> 00:11:17,250
She's a bit like a rock
in this life too.

340
00:11:17,649 --> 00:11:19,320
- That was so funny.
- A rock?

341
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:21,750
She wants to be a rock?
That's hilarious.

342
00:11:22,750 --> 00:11:24,519
- But you didn't laugh.
- I laughed a lot.

343
00:11:24,919 --> 00:11:26,159
I can't believe him.

344
00:11:26,159 --> 00:11:28,590
Please be honest just once.

345
00:11:28,730 --> 00:11:30,690
You didn't even laugh.
Why do you say it's hilarious?

346
00:11:30,690 --> 00:11:32,629
- He confuses me.
- I laughed a lot.

347
00:11:32,700 --> 00:11:33,830
Nothing he says is true.

348
00:11:33,830 --> 00:11:35,330
He didn't laugh at all.

349
00:11:36,129 --> 00:11:37,370
This is a bit too cheesy.

350
00:11:38,399 --> 00:11:40,840
You've been only eating cheese
the whole time. Why do you say that?

351
00:11:41,370 --> 00:11:43,340
You've been only eating cheese.

352
00:11:43,610 --> 00:11:45,639
- In the morning...
- Cheese...

353
00:11:45,639 --> 00:11:47,710
I like eating cheesy food
in the morning.

354
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:49,610
Of course.

355
00:11:50,779 --> 00:11:52,350
Of course I laughed.
Let me try this.

356
00:11:52,350 --> 00:11:53,820
Didn't you say
the food was too cheesy?

357
00:11:54,350 --> 00:11:57,049
- What are you really thinking?
- He only eats cheese.

358
00:11:57,320 --> 00:11:59,759
You confuse me.
Please make me like you.

359
00:11:59,759 --> 00:12:02,289
(What does Seok Jin really think?)

360
00:12:02,289 --> 00:12:04,799
By the way, why are they
feeding us so much?

361
00:12:05,029 --> 00:12:08,100
- This is all we'll eat all day.
- Because we work hard?

362
00:12:08,730 --> 00:12:11,039
So Min, did you plan this episode?

363
00:12:11,039 --> 00:12:12,470
- What?
- Did you plan this episode?

364
00:12:12,470 --> 00:12:15,309
No, I just read the flyer.

365
00:12:15,309 --> 00:12:16,570
- Really?
- I thought you invited us.

366
00:12:17,039 --> 00:12:18,840
This is strange, right?

367
00:12:18,840 --> 00:12:20,110
(There's no way they'll only
dig up gems on Running Man.)

368
00:12:20,110 --> 00:12:22,149
- I love this, but...
- Because we work hard?

369
00:12:22,149 --> 00:12:23,509
We're going to dig up gems?

370
00:12:24,149 --> 00:12:25,450
- It's crowded in here.
- Yes.

371
00:12:25,450 --> 00:12:26,649
- Right.
- Right?

372
00:12:26,950 --> 00:12:28,220
Did you find something?

373
00:12:28,220 --> 00:12:29,519
(Kwang Soo reads the flyer
carefully.)

374
00:12:29,850 --> 00:12:32,590
- We're to find the Immortal Heart.
- The Immortal Heart.

375
00:12:32,590 --> 00:12:34,389
What could this be?

376
00:12:34,460 --> 00:12:35,659
There must be hints hidden here.

377
00:12:35,659 --> 00:12:36,860
Try reading it vertically.

378
00:12:37,389 --> 00:12:38,659
I've already tried it.

379
00:12:38,659 --> 00:12:39,700
- "Ground, ground, world..."
- Try reading it vertically.

380
00:12:39,700 --> 00:12:40,870
"Ground, ground, world..."

381
00:12:40,870 --> 00:12:42,529
Why are these words colored?

382
00:12:42,929 --> 00:12:44,139
- This...
- Gems...

383
00:12:44,139 --> 00:12:46,840
- Why is "gems" colored?
- Right?

384
00:12:46,840 --> 00:12:48,169
The Immortal Heart...

385
00:12:48,169 --> 00:12:49,940
- So Min, why did you take it?
- Why did you take it?

386
00:12:50,039 --> 00:12:51,639
It's mine.

387
00:12:51,639 --> 00:12:52,940
You said you'd be different.

388
00:12:52,940 --> 00:12:54,309
It's not like that.

389
00:12:54,309 --> 00:12:55,850
- We were reading it.
- I'm different.

390
00:12:55,980 --> 00:12:57,820
- Why did you...
- Why did you become so mean?

391
00:12:57,820 --> 00:12:59,580
You're getting greedy again.

392
00:12:59,580 --> 00:13:00,750
- I'm nice now.
- I already...

393
00:13:00,750 --> 00:13:02,120
felt it while talking to her.

394
00:13:02,120 --> 00:13:03,549
- I'm nice now.
- She hasn't changed a bit.

395
00:13:03,549 --> 00:13:05,389
- Why...
- So Min, are you having fun?

396
00:13:05,389 --> 00:13:06,590
- Are you happy?
- Yes.

397
00:13:06,860 --> 00:13:08,889
- I'm excited.
- Let us read it.

398
00:13:08,929 --> 00:13:10,090
You can read it.

399
00:13:10,090 --> 00:13:12,129
- Why can't I read it?
- I can read it?

400
00:13:12,230 --> 00:13:14,299
- Kwang Soo can't read it.
- Why not me?

401
00:13:14,970 --> 00:13:16,529
- Why not me?
- Move.

402
00:13:16,769 --> 00:13:17,940
You're out.

403
00:13:18,269 --> 00:13:20,169
Why not me?

404
00:13:20,169 --> 00:13:22,409
- Yesterday...
- I'm the only one who can read it.

405
00:13:22,409 --> 00:13:24,580
- Why are you doing this?
- I'll read it later.

406
00:13:24,740 --> 00:13:25,909
- Yesterday...
- Why not me?

407
00:13:25,909 --> 00:13:27,509
Yesterday, I realized that So Min...

408
00:13:27,509 --> 00:13:29,250
Guys, did you feel it too?

409
00:13:29,250 --> 00:13:30,450
I'm talking to myself.

410
00:13:30,549 --> 00:13:31,649
No one is listening.

411
00:13:31,879 --> 00:13:33,519
No one is listening to Seok Jin.

412
00:13:34,450 --> 00:13:35,720
It's okay.

413
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:37,450
They're talking.

414
00:13:37,450 --> 00:13:38,820
I shouldn't have cut in.

415
00:13:38,960 --> 00:13:41,190
- I think it's your fault too.
- It's my fault.

416
00:13:41,230 --> 00:13:44,330
The ones who called me often
get to read it first.

417
00:13:44,330 --> 00:13:45,559
- Okay.
- I think it's your fault too.

418
00:13:45,659 --> 00:13:47,529
- Thank you.
- Why are you doing this?

419
00:13:47,529 --> 00:13:49,600
- This is driving me crazy.
- You let Haha read it?

420
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:51,070
- Show us too.
- That brat?

421
00:13:51,240 --> 00:13:53,440
So Min, you're going to
betray us again, right?

422
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:55,210
What are you talking about? Today...

423
00:13:55,210 --> 00:13:56,309
We all...

424
00:13:56,309 --> 00:13:59,340
- It's supposed to be a bonanza.
- Really?

425
00:13:59,340 --> 00:14:02,049
Don't you want to start
digging already?

426
00:14:02,049 --> 00:14:03,250
We'll find so many gems.

427
00:14:03,250 --> 00:14:05,220
- In movies,
- Okay.

428
00:14:05,450 --> 00:14:08,120
people often die one by one
in a remote place.

429
00:14:08,120 --> 00:14:09,320
- That's right.
- There are many movies like that.

430
00:14:09,320 --> 00:14:10,549
I think the first one to die...

431
00:14:10,549 --> 00:14:12,220
will be either Haha or Seok Jin.

432
00:14:12,220 --> 00:14:13,460
(Haha or Seok Jin will die first.)

433
00:14:13,460 --> 00:14:15,360
That's when the movie starts
for real.

434
00:14:15,730 --> 00:14:17,129
I think I'll be
the 2nd or 3rd person to die.

435
00:14:17,129 --> 00:14:19,299
Also, couples always
go deep into the mountains...

436
00:14:19,299 --> 00:14:21,029
- to kiss and die.
- That's right.

437
00:14:21,029 --> 00:14:22,629
- They die as soon as they kiss.
- And...

438
00:14:22,629 --> 00:14:24,470
I know how Seok Jin will die.

439
00:14:24,570 --> 00:14:26,299
He dies while doing
something forbidden.

440
00:14:26,840 --> 00:14:28,940
- Right, he'll do that.
- You know what I mean?

441
00:14:28,940 --> 00:14:30,909
"I don't care. I'll do it anyway."

442
00:14:30,909 --> 00:14:31,940
- Bang!
- Exactly.

443
00:14:31,940 --> 00:14:35,110
- Or while peeing alone.
- Right.

444
00:14:35,210 --> 00:14:37,110
Ms. Rock will survive the longest.

445
00:14:37,279 --> 00:14:38,480
Right, because she doesn't
say anything.

446
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:40,580
- She could be a criminal too.
- Right.

447
00:14:40,779 --> 00:14:42,049
It's so funny
that she wants to be a rock.

448
00:14:42,250 --> 00:14:44,019
Right, it suits her.

449
00:14:44,019 --> 00:14:45,190
I laughed so hard.

450
00:14:45,620 --> 00:14:47,419
I want to be born again as me.

451
00:14:47,419 --> 00:14:48,659
- One more time?
- Yes.

452
00:14:48,659 --> 00:14:49,759
As you?

453
00:14:49,759 --> 00:14:50,889
That's incredible.

454
00:14:50,889 --> 00:14:53,259
- You want to be yourself again.
- That's so cool.

455
00:14:53,259 --> 00:14:54,929
Kwang Soo, what about you?

456
00:14:55,470 --> 00:14:56,600
A basketball player.

457
00:14:57,529 --> 00:14:59,639
- A spoon worm.
- A spoon worm?

458
00:15:00,139 --> 00:15:02,639
- Who wants to be a spoon worm?
- You'll definitely be a spoon worm.

459
00:15:02,639 --> 00:15:04,710
- You'll be caught in Busan.
- A spoon worm?

460
00:15:04,710 --> 00:15:06,440
You'll then be eaten by me
at a sashimi restaurant.

461
00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:08,610
- Right.
- Must you put it that way?

462
00:15:08,950 --> 00:15:10,149
Why not?

463
00:15:10,149 --> 00:15:11,549
Nice and chewy.

464
00:15:11,549 --> 00:15:13,379
- A spoon worm?
- A spoon worm.

465
00:15:13,379 --> 00:15:15,919
- I'll enjoy it too.
- Spoon worms are good.

466
00:15:15,919 --> 00:15:17,620
(After a 10-minute ride,
they arrive at the village.)

467
00:15:17,620 --> 00:15:18,690
What now?

468
00:15:18,690 --> 00:15:20,090
- Over there.
- What's that?

469
00:15:20,090 --> 00:15:22,360
- "Kim Sang Yeob"?
- There's something here.

470
00:15:22,360 --> 00:15:23,789
- I'm getting a headache.
- What's this?

471
00:15:23,789 --> 00:15:25,129
They don't waste any time, do they?

472
00:15:25,529 --> 00:15:27,600
Must we start digging
the moment we exit the van?

473
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:29,029
- I'm already getting a headache.
- What's going on?

474
00:15:29,029 --> 00:15:32,340
- As soon as we got here...
- I'm already getting a headache.

475
00:15:32,340 --> 00:15:33,940
I wonder what's here.

476
00:15:33,940 --> 00:15:35,710
(It seems like
an ordinary rural village.)

477
00:15:36,610 --> 00:15:39,379
(However, an eerie vibe
can be detected.)

478
00:15:40,409 --> 00:15:43,480
(Padlocks can be seen everywhere.)

479
00:15:44,779 --> 00:15:47,889
(The village seems ordinary,
but it isn't.)

480
00:15:49,350 --> 00:15:52,960
(What events will take place here?)

481
00:15:53,889 --> 00:15:56,659
Wait, what's this?

482
00:15:56,659 --> 00:15:58,460
- Why are we here today?
- Hello.

483
00:15:58,460 --> 00:15:59,860
- Hello.
- It's a village.

484
00:15:59,860 --> 00:16:01,600
- Hi.
- Digging up gems...

485
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:02,870
Hello and welcome.

486
00:16:02,870 --> 00:16:04,200
- Hi.
- We're at a village.

487
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:06,970
- Hello.
- Welcome to Gujeon Village.

488
00:16:07,070 --> 00:16:08,539
- The village head.
- Is he the village head?

489
00:16:08,539 --> 00:16:10,570
- I'm the chairman of the youth.
- Hello.

490
00:16:10,570 --> 00:16:12,610
- Hello.
- It's good to see you.

491
00:16:12,610 --> 00:16:15,009
(Park Cheong Nyeon, chairman
of the young village people)

492
00:16:15,009 --> 00:16:17,279
(He shows visitors around who
are here to dig up the gems.)

493
00:16:18,019 --> 00:16:19,850
(He's the youngest resident
of this village.)

494
00:16:19,850 --> 00:16:21,289
- Chairman of the youth?
- Yes.

495
00:16:21,289 --> 00:16:22,950
- Did you hear that?
- Are you sure?

496
00:16:22,950 --> 00:16:24,990
Yes, that's right.

497
00:16:24,990 --> 00:16:27,620
You should first
sanitize your hands.

498
00:16:27,620 --> 00:16:30,159
Are you here to dig up the diamonds?

499
00:16:30,159 --> 00:16:32,360
I heard that
there are diamonds everywhere.

500
00:16:32,360 --> 00:16:34,500
That's right. Every time you dig,

501
00:16:34,500 --> 00:16:36,970
- you'll find a diamond.
- Really?

502
00:16:36,970 --> 00:16:37,970
(Dozens of diamonds
are supposedly buried in the field.)

503
00:16:38,269 --> 00:16:39,440
The most valuable gem...

504
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:41,769
- is the red diamond.
- Red?

505
00:16:41,769 --> 00:16:43,110
- The one called the Immortal Heart.
- It's called the Immortal Heart.

506
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:44,740
So you already know.

507
00:16:44,740 --> 00:16:48,580
Word got out that the diamond
could change your life.

508
00:16:48,580 --> 00:16:49,679
(Finding the Immortal Heart
will change your life.)

509
00:16:49,679 --> 00:16:53,379
Anyway, our proud gem field
is that way.

510
00:16:53,879 --> 00:16:55,289
- There are some people digging.
- Right.

511
00:16:55,289 --> 00:16:57,120
You can get digging too.

512
00:16:57,120 --> 00:17:00,460
Why aren't you also
digging with the others?

513
00:17:00,460 --> 00:17:02,360
- I mean...
- You must already have a lot.

514
00:17:02,360 --> 00:17:04,900
I may not have the touch
because I'm never lucky.

515
00:17:04,900 --> 00:17:06,230
- I see.
- So it's not easy.

516
00:17:06,230 --> 00:17:07,660
- They're not easy to dig.
- It's not easy at all.

517
00:17:07,660 --> 00:17:09,470
- You need a bit of luck.
- Yes, exactly.

518
00:17:09,470 --> 00:17:11,369
Can we get digging then?

519
00:17:11,369 --> 00:17:12,869
Yes, you can.

520
00:17:12,869 --> 00:17:16,039
Once you dig up the gems,
you will take them to the pawnshop.

521
00:17:16,039 --> 00:17:17,269
(Pawnshop)

522
00:17:17,269 --> 00:17:18,309
(Pawnshop)

523
00:17:18,309 --> 00:17:19,380
- There it is.
- Right.

524
00:17:19,380 --> 00:17:20,880
- So there...
- We can cash them in?

525
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:22,579
- Yes, straight into cash.
- Really?

526
00:17:23,180 --> 00:17:25,720
If you get hungry
or thirsty while digging,

527
00:17:25,720 --> 00:17:28,690
you can head to the stall
to buy snacks.

528
00:17:28,789 --> 00:17:31,089
- Got it.
- Now, please take your tools.

529
00:17:31,089 --> 00:17:33,220
- You can then get digging.
- Sure.

530
00:17:33,220 --> 00:17:34,690
I can't believe this.

531
00:17:34,690 --> 00:17:36,529
I don't know what to expect today.

532
00:17:36,529 --> 00:17:38,130
(Will they be able to find
the Immortal Heart?)

533
00:17:40,799 --> 00:17:42,599
There are a lot of people here.

534
00:17:42,599 --> 00:17:45,299
- Look at all these people.
- Now I'm getting greedy.

535
00:17:45,299 --> 00:17:46,700
- Hello.
- I'm getting a weird feeling.

536
00:17:46,700 --> 00:17:48,940
Are the gems randomly spread out?

537
00:17:48,940 --> 00:17:51,579
- Hello.
- Goodness, hello.

538
00:17:51,579 --> 00:17:52,940
Have you dug up any gems?

539
00:17:52,940 --> 00:17:54,779
- Did you find the red diamond?
- Have you gotten lucky?

540
00:17:54,779 --> 00:17:57,309
- What does it look like?
- We haven't seen it either.

541
00:17:57,309 --> 00:17:59,650
Please let us see it
if you come across one.

542
00:17:59,650 --> 00:18:01,349
- Exactly.
- The red diamond.

543
00:18:01,349 --> 00:18:03,349
- Have you not dug it up?
- The Immortal Heart.

544
00:18:03,349 --> 00:18:04,990
- Hello.
- Hi.

545
00:18:04,990 --> 00:18:06,619
- I doubt there's anything here.
- They haven't gotten lucky.

546
00:18:06,619 --> 00:18:08,589
Are you residents of this village?

547
00:18:08,589 --> 00:18:10,059
- No.
- Are you outsiders?

548
00:18:10,059 --> 00:18:11,359
- We came after hearing the rumors.
- Where are you from?

549
00:18:11,359 --> 00:18:14,400
- We heard about the diamonds.
- So you came to dig them up?

550
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:16,299
- Yes.
- You all have name tags though.

551
00:18:16,299 --> 00:18:17,630
Are you sisters?

552
00:18:17,630 --> 00:18:19,940
- Yes, sisters.
- You four are all sisters.

553
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:22,539
(Kim Il Nyeo, Kim E Nyeo,
Kim Sam Nyeo, Kim Sa Nyeo)

554
00:18:22,539 --> 00:18:23,970
(Four sisters, non-residents)

555
00:18:25,009 --> 00:18:28,279
(They all dig in order
to find the diamonds.)

556
00:18:28,279 --> 00:18:29,480
There must be
a few things buried here.

557
00:18:29,480 --> 00:18:31,079
It's getting hot though.

558
00:18:31,619 --> 00:18:33,250
But it was chilly all day.

559
00:18:35,289 --> 00:18:37,690
We were told to dig
because there's something here.

560
00:18:37,690 --> 00:18:40,019
- There probably is.
- How deep should we dig?

561
00:18:40,589 --> 00:18:41,660
Let's see.

562
00:18:42,490 --> 00:18:44,430
Are you sure
there are diamonds here?

563
00:18:44,430 --> 00:18:45,799
Are they even here?

564
00:18:45,799 --> 00:18:47,299
I thought we just had to dig?

565
00:18:47,299 --> 00:18:48,670
There's nothing here.

566
00:18:48,670 --> 00:18:50,269
Are you sure they're buried here?

567
00:18:50,269 --> 00:18:51,369
- Right?
- Did you find something?

568
00:18:51,599 --> 00:18:52,769
Hold on.

569
00:18:52,769 --> 00:18:53,900
What is it?

570
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:55,339
It's nothing.

571
00:18:56,470 --> 00:18:58,009
- Why?
- What is it?

572
00:18:58,240 --> 00:18:59,579
Did you find something?

573
00:19:02,910 --> 00:19:05,549
(It's just a rock.)

574
00:19:05,549 --> 00:19:08,420
- It's only a rock.
- Seriously?

575
00:19:08,420 --> 00:19:10,049
Hey, you found Ji Hyo.

576
00:19:10,119 --> 00:19:12,490
A rock. That's you, Ji Hyo.

577
00:19:12,490 --> 00:19:15,059
Look how big it is.
I was startled too.

578
00:19:15,059 --> 00:19:16,130
(What's Ji Hyo doing here?)

579
00:19:16,430 --> 00:19:17,529
Ji Hyo!

580
00:19:17,529 --> 00:19:18,559
(She said it to a rock.)

581
00:19:20,130 --> 00:19:21,599
That's huge.

582
00:19:21,599 --> 00:19:23,930
Can't you guys just leave me alone?

583
00:19:23,930 --> 00:19:26,140
Ji Hyo's everywhere.

584
00:19:26,140 --> 00:19:27,200
(Ji Hyo's buried everywhere.)

585
00:19:27,299 --> 00:19:28,670
This is odd though.

586
00:19:28,670 --> 00:19:30,170
Are you sure there are gems here?

587
00:19:30,170 --> 00:19:32,940
It doesn't make sense that
gems would be buried here.

588
00:19:32,940 --> 00:19:34,980
(Not even the 4 sisters
have been successful.)

589
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:38,420
- What's this?
- My gosh!

590
00:19:38,420 --> 00:19:39,450
(My gosh!)

591
00:19:39,950 --> 00:19:41,450
- He must've found one.
- I found one.

592
00:19:41,450 --> 00:19:42,750
- Really?
- He did!

593
00:19:42,750 --> 00:19:43,819
(He finally finds a gem.)

594
00:19:43,819 --> 00:19:45,390
- It was there.
- They really must be buried here.

595
00:19:45,390 --> 00:19:47,289
- Let me see.
- They're really buried here.

596
00:19:47,359 --> 00:19:49,230
- It's true.
- Let's get digging.

597
00:19:49,230 --> 00:19:51,329
- This wasn't a hoax.
- Look at him.

598
00:19:51,329 --> 00:19:52,960
- You've all gone crazy.
- It's red!

599
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:55,500
They're really here.
Anyway, I'll head to the pawnshop.

600
00:19:55,500 --> 00:19:56,799
They're really here.

601
00:19:56,799 --> 00:19:58,400
- The rumors were true.
- I wonder how much it's worth.

602
00:19:59,269 --> 00:20:00,369
It was really here.

603
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:03,069
- Welcome.
- Hi.

604
00:20:03,140 --> 00:20:04,539
What do you have for me?

605
00:20:04,539 --> 00:20:07,910
(Jeon Dang Po, a master haggler)

606
00:20:08,009 --> 00:20:09,579
- I found a gem.
- Really?

607
00:20:09,809 --> 00:20:11,109
Let me take a look.

608
00:20:11,480 --> 00:20:12,519
(His hopes are up.)

609
00:20:12,519 --> 00:20:15,220
- But it's quite big.
- You're not kidding.

610
00:20:17,049 --> 00:20:19,460
Since you're my first customer,
I'll give you a good bargain.

611
00:20:20,759 --> 00:20:22,029
(A chance to change one's life)

612
00:20:22,029 --> 00:20:24,930
(How much is this gem worth?)

613
00:20:24,930 --> 00:20:26,799
- Three dollars.
- What?

614
00:20:27,599 --> 00:20:29,430
- But it's a gem.
- Three dollars.

615
00:20:29,769 --> 00:20:31,940
- I'll take it then.
- Good.

616
00:20:32,299 --> 00:20:33,769
- Here you go.
- Got it.

617
00:20:33,869 --> 00:20:35,339
Thank you.

618
00:20:35,339 --> 00:20:37,440
Bring me another and
I'll give you another good bargain.

619
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:38,710
I mean...

620
00:20:39,039 --> 00:20:40,940
Three dollars for a gem?

621
00:20:40,940 --> 00:20:42,150
(It's too cheap for a gem.)

622
00:20:43,349 --> 00:20:44,480
(He's pleased to have
found a gem though.)

623
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:46,180
- How much was it?
- What?

624
00:20:46,180 --> 00:20:47,349
Did you cash it in?

625
00:20:47,349 --> 00:20:48,950
You'll be surprised
by what it's worth.

626
00:20:48,950 --> 00:20:50,619
- Really?
- You'll be shocked.

627
00:20:50,619 --> 00:20:52,119
I'm switching to a pickax.

628
00:20:52,990 --> 00:20:54,759
I see you're all busy digging.

629
00:20:54,759 --> 00:20:56,690
My body will
ache all over tomorrow.

630
00:20:57,589 --> 00:20:59,400
I'm going crazy now that
I know there are gems here.

631
00:20:59,799 --> 00:21:02,269
This is why
we were fed this morning.

632
00:21:02,269 --> 00:21:04,000
(It's why they were
given breakfast.)

633
00:21:04,430 --> 00:21:07,940
- Found it!
- Really?

634
00:21:08,509 --> 00:21:10,509
- Where?
- I found one!

635
00:21:10,509 --> 00:21:12,880
- Where was it?
- I found a gem.

636
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:14,440
Many must be buried over there.

637
00:21:14,440 --> 00:21:15,710
- Nice!
- Are they all over there?

638
00:21:15,710 --> 00:21:17,349
- Was it buried deep?
- No.

639
00:21:17,349 --> 00:21:18,349
(They couldn't be more jealous.)

640
00:21:18,349 --> 00:21:19,880
You don't have to dig that deep.

641
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:21,490
Really?

642
00:21:21,950 --> 00:21:23,390
Is that the pawnshop?

643
00:21:24,190 --> 00:21:25,990
I want to check out the stall first.

644
00:21:25,990 --> 00:21:27,990
And then I'll head to the pawnshop.

645
00:21:28,259 --> 00:21:29,529
Hello.

646
00:21:29,630 --> 00:21:31,599
- Welcome.
- Do you only take cash?

647
00:21:31,599 --> 00:21:34,900
And the gem must be cashed in
at the pawnshop?

648
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:37,000
- Are you here to dig up the gems?
- Yes.

649
00:21:37,569 --> 00:21:39,839
- You can get anything you want.
- I'm just here to look.

650
00:21:39,839 --> 00:21:40,970
- Is that so?
- Yes.

651
00:21:41,369 --> 00:21:43,640
- They're on the pricier side.
- Really?

652
00:21:43,640 --> 00:21:46,140
- Anyway, I'll be back.
- Sure.

653
00:21:47,539 --> 00:21:50,750
(Kim Ga Ge, stall owner,
doesn't intend to sell anything)

654
00:21:50,750 --> 00:21:51,950
Was it buried deep?

655
00:21:51,950 --> 00:21:53,619
You don't have to dig deep.

656
00:21:55,890 --> 00:21:57,450
- Found one!
- What?

657
00:21:57,450 --> 00:21:58,920
- I...
- It's blue.

658
00:22:00,359 --> 00:22:02,190
I bet you haven't seen
a blue one before.

659
00:22:03,059 --> 00:22:04,160
It's a real gem.

660
00:22:04,160 --> 00:22:05,829
It's also known
as an angel's teardrop.

661
00:22:05,829 --> 00:22:07,200
- An angel's teardrop?
- That's not it.

662
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:08,569
It's the Immortal Heart.

663
00:22:08,799 --> 00:22:10,269
You have your chance now.

664
00:22:10,269 --> 00:22:11,900
- Hurry over to the pawnshop.
- Get going.

665
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:13,200
- Here.
- Let me see.

666
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:14,940
I bet you haven't
seen one like this before.

667
00:22:14,940 --> 00:22:16,609
- What is it?
- It's a diamond,

668
00:22:16,609 --> 00:22:18,210
also known as an angel's teardrop.

669
00:22:18,210 --> 00:22:19,940
- Isn't this the Tear of Yondu?
- It isn't.

670
00:22:20,009 --> 00:22:21,509
- Hold on.
- It's blue.

671
00:22:21,509 --> 00:22:23,009
You brought me a precious kind.

672
00:22:23,450 --> 00:22:25,480
- It's quite valuable.
- But it's covered in scratches.

673
00:22:25,480 --> 00:22:27,950
- Look at the scratches.
- Since it's a precious one,

674
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:30,190
I'll give you a dollar for it.

675
00:22:30,450 --> 00:22:31,789
He said a dollar.

676
00:22:31,789 --> 00:22:33,359
It has too many scratches on it.

677
00:22:33,359 --> 00:22:35,160
But that's not my fault.

678
00:22:35,160 --> 00:22:37,930
You should've brought me one
without any scratches.

679
00:22:37,930 --> 00:22:39,130
Off you go.

680
00:22:39,130 --> 00:22:40,200
Get digging again.

681
00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:42,829
I was hoping for a lot
since it's a gem, but a dollar...

682
00:22:42,829 --> 00:22:44,369
(Kwang Soo can't seem to walk away.)

683
00:22:45,799 --> 00:22:47,240
What can I do with a dollar anyway?

684
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:49,269
Where's the stall?

685
00:22:51,109 --> 00:22:53,980
(He heads to the stall
with a dollar.)

686
00:22:53,980 --> 00:22:55,509
- What?
- Kwang Soo!

687
00:22:57,480 --> 00:22:59,450
(Kwang Soo!)

688
00:23:00,279 --> 00:23:01,950
Are you here to dig up gems too?

689
00:23:01,950 --> 00:23:04,990
(Someone seems happy
to see Kwang Soo.)

690
00:23:04,990 --> 00:23:06,690
- The Immortal Heart.
- Yes?

691
00:23:06,990 --> 00:23:09,289
- Isn't that what you're after?
- Yes, the red diamond.

692
00:23:11,900 --> 00:23:15,369
(Kwang Soo talks to a mystery woman
for quite some time.)

693
00:23:15,369 --> 00:23:16,400
Thank you.

694
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:19,440
(Then he heads to someplace.)

695
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:20,769
The pink container building?

696
00:23:21,539 --> 00:23:22,940
The pink container building...

697
00:23:24,410 --> 00:23:25,910
Why is he running over there?

698
00:23:26,210 --> 00:23:28,450
- Where is he going?
- Where... Hey!

699
00:23:28,450 --> 00:23:30,109
(They detect that something is up
and chase after him.)

700
00:23:30,109 --> 00:23:31,650
He must have new information.

701
00:23:36,289 --> 00:23:37,390
Is this the place?

702
00:23:37,390 --> 00:23:39,589
(He finds a new field
behind the pink container building.)

703
00:23:39,589 --> 00:23:41,289
- Must I dig again?
- Let's follow them.

704
00:23:41,289 --> 00:23:42,759
Don't bother.

705
00:23:42,759 --> 00:23:44,259
- Come on.
- Gosh.

706
00:23:44,259 --> 00:23:45,299
Let's get over there.

707
00:23:45,299 --> 00:23:47,160
- But wait...
- I'm heading over there.

708
00:23:47,160 --> 00:23:48,599
- Come on.
- Come with us too.

709
00:23:48,599 --> 00:23:49,700
Don't force me.

710
00:23:49,700 --> 00:23:51,500
- Let's go.
- I'm going to keep digging here.

711
00:23:51,500 --> 00:23:53,500
What's going on?
Why did they head over there?

712
00:23:53,599 --> 00:23:55,009
Kwang Soo suddenly ran over there.

713
00:23:55,809 --> 00:23:58,309
(Kwang Soo starts digging.)

714
00:23:58,309 --> 00:24:00,539
Jae Seok.
How did you know to follow me?

715
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:02,650
You don't know yet, do you?

716
00:24:02,650 --> 00:24:04,920
- Know what?
- The Immortal Heart is buried here.

717
00:24:05,049 --> 00:24:06,279
- Really?
- Yes.

718
00:24:06,279 --> 00:24:07,650
(The Immortal Heart is buried here.)

719
00:24:07,650 --> 00:24:09,119
- Really?
- Yes.

720
00:24:09,619 --> 00:24:11,420
A local resident told me.

721
00:24:12,259 --> 00:24:13,619
It's no use digging over there.

722
00:24:13,960 --> 00:24:14,960
What is it?

723
00:24:15,359 --> 00:24:17,230
- Hurry on over.
- Get digging.

724
00:24:17,230 --> 00:24:18,829
(Se Chan joins them.)

725
00:24:18,829 --> 00:24:21,000
Whoever finds it
must split the money though.

726
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:22,329
- Of course.
- Now everyone's here.

727
00:24:22,329 --> 00:24:25,369
- We'll dig too.
- We're here to dig as well.

728
00:24:25,369 --> 00:24:27,000
Promise that
you'll split the money though.

729
00:24:27,339 --> 00:24:28,970
If only there's anything here.

730
00:24:28,970 --> 00:24:30,210
Until when must we dig?

731
00:24:30,440 --> 00:24:34,039
Jae Seok, Kwang Soo
talked to a woman earlier.

732
00:24:34,039 --> 00:24:35,680
- What?
- She told me...

733
00:24:35,680 --> 00:24:37,180
that the Immortal Heart was here.

734
00:24:37,180 --> 00:24:39,180
She was wearing a white hanbok.

735
00:24:39,180 --> 00:24:40,279
- A white hanbok?
- Yes.

736
00:24:40,420 --> 00:24:44,390
Her name is Kwang Ja though.

737
00:24:44,390 --> 00:24:45,789
- She had a name?
- Really?

738
00:24:47,390 --> 00:24:48,630
I wonder who she is.

739
00:24:48,630 --> 00:24:50,230
(Jong Kook was on
his way to the pawnshop.)

740
00:24:50,230 --> 00:24:51,329
(He spots a mysterious woman
and sees her name.)

741
00:24:51,329 --> 00:24:53,630
Kwang Ja? That name...

742
00:24:54,230 --> 00:24:55,529
Kwang Soo!

743
00:24:55,529 --> 00:24:58,269
(Just like Jong Kook saw...)

744
00:24:58,269 --> 00:25:01,269
(The mysterious woman's name
is Lee Kwang Ja.)

745
00:25:01,269 --> 00:25:03,240
Her name is Kwang Ja though.

746
00:25:03,240 --> 00:25:04,509
- She had a name?
- Really?

747
00:25:04,509 --> 00:25:06,710
- Is she your sister?
- Is she family?

748
00:25:06,710 --> 00:25:08,450
Who's Kwang Ja? Tell us.

749
00:25:08,809 --> 00:25:10,410
I don't know who she is.
She said she lives here.

750
00:25:10,609 --> 00:25:12,319
I find Kwang Soo strange.

751
00:25:12,319 --> 00:25:13,880
He was with her.

752
00:25:14,549 --> 00:25:16,220
I swear it's not me today.

753
00:25:16,220 --> 00:25:18,019
I swear it's not me.

754
00:25:18,019 --> 00:25:19,920
Why is her name Kwang Ja then?

755
00:25:19,920 --> 00:25:22,230
I didn't see her name tag.
I didn't know she was Kwang Ja.

756
00:25:22,230 --> 00:25:23,460
I find it so strange
that you didn't see her name tag.

757
00:25:23,460 --> 00:25:24,490
That's strange.

758
00:25:24,490 --> 00:25:26,160
That's the first thing I saw.

759
00:25:26,160 --> 00:25:27,200
- Okay.
- Right?

760
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:29,000
- Anyway...
- I didn't see it.

761
00:25:29,170 --> 00:25:31,700
Kwang Soo made us
all come here, right?

762
00:25:31,700 --> 00:25:33,400
Is it possible he lured us here...

763
00:25:33,400 --> 00:25:34,700
- so that he can do something else?
- That's true.

764
00:25:34,700 --> 00:25:36,369
- Maybe there's nothing here.
- No way.

765
00:25:36,369 --> 00:25:37,809
- No way.
- What is it?

766
00:25:37,809 --> 00:25:39,740
I'm not certain either,
but she told me.

767
00:25:39,740 --> 00:25:41,680
- She lives here.
- She was Kwang Ja.

768
00:25:41,710 --> 00:25:43,009
He's avoiding our eyes.

769
00:25:46,549 --> 00:25:49,250
(Name: Lee Kwang Ja, occupation
and characteristic unknown)

770
00:25:49,490 --> 00:25:50,819
There's nothing.

771
00:25:50,920 --> 00:25:52,490
- There's nothing here.
- There's nothing.

772
00:25:52,490 --> 00:25:53,720
We kept digging,
and there's nothing.

773
00:25:53,720 --> 00:25:55,559
- That was false information.
- We went deep.

774
00:26:02,369 --> 00:26:03,529
- What is it?
- He found it.

775
00:26:04,299 --> 00:26:07,140
(He found
the Immortal Heart gem box!)

776
00:26:07,140 --> 00:26:08,640
He got it.

777
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:10,910
- He knew the location.
- I'm sure.

778
00:26:10,910 --> 00:26:12,910
- There must be a gem for real.
- It's okay.

779
00:26:12,910 --> 00:26:15,380
- What's this?
- It's a red diary.

780
00:26:15,410 --> 00:26:17,410
This is the Immortal Diamond.

781
00:26:17,410 --> 00:26:19,019
It's a red diamond.

782
00:26:19,019 --> 00:26:20,549
- You found it?
- Can I see too?

783
00:26:20,549 --> 00:26:21,890
- Hold on.
- It's a red diamond.

784
00:26:21,890 --> 00:26:22,890
Please don't get close.

785
00:26:22,890 --> 00:26:24,190
Can I touch it?

786
00:26:24,190 --> 00:26:25,519
Get closer.

787
00:26:25,519 --> 00:26:27,420
- Don't touch it.
- I won't.

788
00:26:27,420 --> 00:26:28,990
- We'll watch.
- We'll watch.

789
00:26:28,990 --> 00:26:31,190
- Hurry.
- I saw something shiny.

790
00:26:31,190 --> 00:26:33,099
Open it with the key.

791
00:26:33,099 --> 00:26:34,759
- There's no key.
- There isn't.

792
00:26:34,759 --> 00:26:38,000
If it's a real gem, you get
good energy when you touch it.

793
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:39,200
- If it's a real gem?
- Really?

794
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:40,700
- Oh, no. Wait.
- Don't touch it.

795
00:26:40,700 --> 00:26:42,609
I'll only touch it.

796
00:26:42,609 --> 00:26:44,269
- Show us.
- Touch it.

797
00:26:44,269 --> 00:26:45,640
- I can't open it.
- Find it.

798
00:26:45,640 --> 00:26:47,180
- If you touch it...
- They said...

799
00:26:47,180 --> 00:26:49,450
- you get good energy.
- Just by touching it?

800
00:26:49,450 --> 00:26:51,609
- Come here. Let me touch it.
- Let me touch it.

801
00:26:51,609 --> 00:26:52,980
- No, wait.
- Let me touch it.

802
00:26:52,980 --> 00:26:54,119
Did you find it?

803
00:26:54,119 --> 00:26:55,190
Let me touch it.

804
00:26:55,190 --> 00:26:56,420
You get good energy
when you touch it.

805
00:26:56,420 --> 00:26:58,619
What do you think?
Do you feel energized already?

806
00:26:58,619 --> 00:27:00,559
- I'm not sure.
- Let me touch it.

807
00:27:00,559 --> 00:27:02,160
- Why?
- My gosh.

808
00:27:02,160 --> 00:27:03,329
- Do you feel it?
- We found it.

809
00:27:03,329 --> 00:27:05,000
- Don't take it.
- Hey!

810
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:06,259
(At that moment!)

811
00:27:06,259 --> 00:27:09,069
(Kim Sa Nyeo steals the box
and runs away!)

812
00:27:09,069 --> 00:27:10,599
Sa Nyeo!

813
00:27:10,599 --> 00:27:11,970
What is she doing?

814
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:13,299
You can't take it.

815
00:27:13,700 --> 00:27:14,700
She's a thief!

816
00:27:14,700 --> 00:27:16,609
- What are you doing?
- She's a thief.

817
00:27:16,609 --> 00:27:18,609
This is good, so I want to
bring it home for my husband.

818
00:27:18,609 --> 00:27:21,210
- Why did you take it?
- You can't!

819
00:27:21,210 --> 00:27:23,180
- I want to let my husband touch it.
- Kwang Soo found it.

820
00:27:23,180 --> 00:27:24,650
You can't take it.

821
00:27:24,650 --> 00:27:26,019
Why?

822
00:27:26,019 --> 00:27:27,279
Fine.

823
00:27:27,279 --> 00:27:29,519
I was just fooling around with you.

824
00:27:29,519 --> 00:27:31,190
- We just wanted to touch it.
- She was fooling around with you.

825
00:27:31,190 --> 00:27:33,960
- I'm sure.
- There's no key.

826
00:27:34,220 --> 00:27:35,430
We have no key.

827
00:27:35,430 --> 00:27:37,390
- Il Nyeo,
- Why do they want this?

828
00:27:37,390 --> 00:27:39,160
- let's so somewhere else.
- Let's go take a rest.

829
00:27:39,160 --> 00:27:40,400
- Let's go somewhere else.
- We have no key,

830
00:27:40,400 --> 00:27:41,970
- so there's no point having this.
- I know.

831
00:27:41,970 --> 00:27:44,700
He met Kwang Ja
in front of the supermarket.

832
00:27:44,700 --> 00:27:46,299
- Let's go there.
- Let's go over first.

833
00:27:46,299 --> 00:27:48,569
- Let's find out why.
- Ji Hyo, hold onto this.

834
00:27:48,769 --> 00:27:50,440
But I found it.

835
00:27:50,440 --> 00:27:52,410
It doesn't even matter.

836
00:27:52,410 --> 00:27:53,410
Still.

837
00:27:54,279 --> 00:27:56,410
- I found it.
- That's true.

838
00:27:56,410 --> 00:27:58,720
- Sure.
- There's a supermarket.

839
00:27:58,720 --> 00:28:00,019
We have to meet her to resolve this.

840
00:28:00,750 --> 00:28:02,390
- There she is.
- There's a supermarket.

841
00:28:02,390 --> 00:28:04,119
- Kwang Ja is over there.
- It's her.

842
00:28:04,119 --> 00:28:05,220
Hello.

843
00:28:06,319 --> 00:28:07,619
- We found it.
- You're back.

844
00:28:07,619 --> 00:28:08,660
We found it.

845
00:28:08,930 --> 00:28:10,630
What's that?

846
00:28:10,630 --> 00:28:13,130
- We found it.
- Can I have it?

847
00:28:13,259 --> 00:28:14,400
- Can I have it?
- Maybe not.

848
00:28:14,400 --> 00:28:16,599
- She's Kwang Ja.
- She talks weird.

849
00:28:16,599 --> 00:28:18,099
She sounds just like you.

850
00:28:18,099 --> 00:28:19,500
I sound like her?
What are you talking about?

851
00:28:19,500 --> 00:28:21,599
- You sound like her.
- Do you know about the key?

852
00:28:21,599 --> 00:28:22,769
Do you know where it is?

853
00:28:23,710 --> 00:28:28,650
Well, I don't know much,

854
00:28:29,549 --> 00:28:34,779
but the village head
knows everything.

855
00:28:34,849 --> 00:28:36,150
Where's the village head?

856
00:28:36,150 --> 00:28:37,490
Where is he?

857
00:28:37,890 --> 00:28:40,990
The village head is over there!

858
00:28:40,990 --> 00:28:42,859
Over there?
There must be a village head.

859
00:28:42,859 --> 00:28:44,130
We have to find him.

860
00:28:44,130 --> 00:28:45,460
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

861
00:28:45,460 --> 00:28:46,859
- Thanks a lot.
- Thanks a lot.

862
00:28:46,859 --> 00:28:48,359
Their names are so similar.

863
00:28:48,359 --> 00:28:49,500
Lee Kwang Ja.

864
00:28:49,500 --> 00:28:51,500
It's a coincidence.
She's not related to me.

865
00:28:51,500 --> 00:28:54,700
Hey, she won't do that
if she's not related to you.

866
00:28:54,700 --> 00:28:57,210
The village head. Village head!

867
00:28:57,210 --> 00:28:58,880
- He's over here.
- It's him!

868
00:28:58,880 --> 00:29:00,079
He's over there.

869
00:29:00,079 --> 00:29:01,279
Mr. Choi!

870
00:29:01,910 --> 00:29:03,279
(Name: Choi Yi Jang)

871
00:29:03,279 --> 00:29:06,250
(Characteristic: village head, knows
most secrets, has early dementia)

872
00:29:06,250 --> 00:29:07,279
Mr. Choi?

873
00:29:07,880 --> 00:29:09,119
- What's wrong?
- Mr. Choi.

874
00:29:09,589 --> 00:29:10,789
- Mr. Choi!
- He's in a wheelchair.

875
00:29:10,789 --> 00:29:12,789
- Is it you?
- Hello, sir.

876
00:29:12,789 --> 00:29:14,289
Who are you?

877
00:29:14,289 --> 00:29:17,390
- We're visitors.
- Are you guys visiting?

878
00:29:17,390 --> 00:29:19,160
Yes, sir.

879
00:29:19,160 --> 00:29:21,930
We're here to find gems,
and we dug this up.

880
00:29:22,529 --> 00:29:24,700
Do you know where the key is
by any chance?

881
00:29:24,700 --> 00:29:26,400
What is that?

882
00:29:26,970 --> 00:29:28,509
Do you not know what this is?

883
00:29:28,509 --> 00:29:29,910
That?

884
00:29:29,910 --> 00:29:33,339
Isn't that a brand name chocolate?

885
00:29:33,339 --> 00:29:34,809
- It's not chocolate.
- It's not.

886
00:29:34,809 --> 00:29:37,549
- It's not chocolate.
- You know about the field, right?

887
00:29:37,549 --> 00:29:39,650
- It's a gem field.
- There's a gem field.

888
00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:43,019
Who said that?
I don't know anything about it.

889
00:29:43,019 --> 00:29:46,420
Sir, do you know any of us?

890
00:29:48,420 --> 00:29:50,930
(Glancing)

891
00:29:52,230 --> 00:29:53,900
He looked at you.

892
00:29:53,900 --> 00:29:54,900
He looked at Seok Jin.

893
00:29:54,900 --> 00:29:56,099
- Seok Jin, he looked at you.
- He looked at you.

894
00:29:56,099 --> 00:29:57,799
- It was him.
- Why are you pointing at me?

895
00:29:57,799 --> 00:30:01,000
- Is he your friend from school?
- Elementary school friend?

896
00:30:01,339 --> 00:30:03,109
(Elementary school friend?)

897
00:30:03,109 --> 00:30:04,769
- Say, "Nice to meet you, friend."
- Do it.

898
00:30:04,769 --> 00:30:05,809
- "Nice to meet you, friend."
- "Nice to meet you, friend."

899
00:30:05,809 --> 00:30:07,309
I don't know.

900
00:30:07,309 --> 00:30:08,410
Nice to meet you, friend.

901
00:30:08,410 --> 00:30:11,109
(Nice to meet you, friend.)

902
00:30:11,109 --> 00:30:13,319
- Goodness!
- He's not.

903
00:30:13,319 --> 00:30:15,349
(They're not school friends.)

904
00:30:15,349 --> 00:30:17,019
Then sir.

905
00:30:17,349 --> 00:30:20,759
Where can we find the key?

906
00:30:20,920 --> 00:30:22,859
My memory is faint.

907
00:30:23,160 --> 00:30:26,059
- I don't know.
- I'll give you some gems.

908
00:30:26,799 --> 00:30:29,069
My gosh. What's wrong with you?

909
00:30:29,069 --> 00:30:30,700
I can't, right?

910
00:30:30,700 --> 00:30:32,269
Every word you say is awful.

911
00:30:32,269 --> 00:30:34,640
Hey, this is not that kind of world.

912
00:30:34,640 --> 00:30:36,970
Stop bothering me! Go away!

913
00:30:37,210 --> 00:30:40,980
He didn't answer anything.

914
00:30:41,009 --> 00:30:43,109
- But this...
- I already told you.

915
00:30:43,109 --> 00:30:45,380
I don't know,
so I have nothing more to say.

916
00:30:45,380 --> 00:30:46,380
- Okay.
- We'll get going.

917
00:30:46,380 --> 00:30:48,150
- We're leaving.
- Excuse us.

918
00:30:48,380 --> 00:30:50,519
There's something.

919
00:30:50,519 --> 00:30:52,089
There's nothing!

920
00:30:52,289 --> 00:30:54,019
Why is he so angry?

921
00:30:54,019 --> 00:30:55,529
You get angry once every minute.

922
00:30:55,529 --> 00:30:57,359
- He's strange.
- It's bad for your health, sir.

923
00:30:57,359 --> 00:30:58,900
- We'll get going.
- We're leaving.

924
00:30:58,900 --> 00:31:00,529
- Thank you, sir.
- Mr. Choi.

925
00:31:00,630 --> 00:31:02,230
- Good luck.
- I wish you good health.

926
00:31:02,230 --> 00:31:04,069
- He's the worst.
- Why would you say "Good luck"?

927
00:31:04,069 --> 00:31:06,039
Why would you say "Good luck"?

928
00:31:06,339 --> 00:31:07,400
I wish you good health, sir.

929
00:31:07,400 --> 00:31:08,400
(They leave without obtaining
any useful information.)

930
00:31:08,769 --> 00:31:11,410
Should we divide ourselves
into teams?

931
00:31:11,640 --> 00:31:13,180
Let's split and look.

932
00:31:13,180 --> 00:31:15,079
- I'll go with Kwang Soo.
- No, I will.

933
00:31:15,079 --> 00:31:16,380
I'll go with him.

934
00:31:16,380 --> 00:31:18,880
Wait. Why am I so popular?

935
00:31:18,880 --> 00:31:20,549
- I have nothing!
- Let's go.

936
00:31:20,549 --> 00:31:21,990
- Kwang Soo.
- Then...

937
00:31:21,990 --> 00:31:23,519
I'll go with one of you.

938
00:31:23,519 --> 00:31:25,190
- I'll go with you.
- Let's go.

939
00:31:25,859 --> 00:31:28,190
- Leave!
- Okay, I'm going by myself.

940
00:31:28,190 --> 00:31:30,460
(Se Chan is looking for the key
by himself.)

941
00:31:30,930 --> 00:31:31,960
What's the R mark?

942
00:31:31,960 --> 00:31:33,359
(What's the R mark?)

943
00:31:35,029 --> 00:31:36,400
I can hear them. What?

944
00:31:36,500 --> 00:31:37,769
(What?)

945
00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:40,099
(He seems to have found something.)

946
00:31:40,099 --> 00:31:41,170
- What is it?
- It's nothing.

947
00:31:41,170 --> 00:31:42,910
- Why?
- It's nothing.

948
00:31:42,910 --> 00:31:44,069
Stop being so cheap.

949
00:31:44,069 --> 00:31:45,140
(He goes somewhere in a hurry.)

950
00:31:45,140 --> 00:31:47,210
- Stop being so cheap.
- What's this?

951
00:31:47,809 --> 00:31:48,809
What's this?

952
00:31:48,809 --> 00:31:51,410
(He finds
a mysterious gem box.)

953
00:31:51,410 --> 00:31:53,180
What's this?

954
00:31:53,380 --> 00:31:55,250
What's that? He found something.

955
00:31:55,420 --> 00:31:57,819
- Hey!
- Don't speak so loudly.

956
00:31:57,819 --> 00:31:59,619
- Don't say it!
- I have to carry it around.

957
00:31:59,619 --> 00:32:00,990
- I have no key.
- I'm curious.

958
00:32:00,990 --> 00:32:02,130
Let me see. I'm only going to look.

959
00:32:02,130 --> 00:32:03,730
- Haha!
- Look at this, Haha.

960
00:32:03,789 --> 00:32:05,460
- What's that?
- We don't know.

961
00:32:05,960 --> 00:32:07,230
- He found it.
- Where did you find it?

962
00:32:07,230 --> 00:32:08,359
- Down there.
- Down there.

963
00:32:08,359 --> 00:32:10,900
You two are amazing
when you're a team.

964
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:12,240
Here he goes again.

965
00:32:13,269 --> 00:32:14,369
Love power?

966
00:32:14,369 --> 00:32:15,369
(Is this love power?)

967
00:32:15,369 --> 00:32:16,809
I knew you were going to mention it.

968
00:32:16,809 --> 00:32:18,609
- He found it by himself.
- Hey.

969
00:32:18,609 --> 00:32:20,509
Hold her hand. Stop running off.

970
00:32:20,509 --> 00:32:21,640
There's something over there.

971
00:32:21,640 --> 00:32:22,849
- Where?
- Up there.

972
00:32:22,980 --> 00:32:24,549
- By the scarecrow.
- Did you see it?

973
00:32:25,380 --> 00:32:26,519
There's something up there.

974
00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:27,720
Don't do it.

975
00:32:28,450 --> 00:32:29,650
Inside...

976
00:32:30,490 --> 00:32:31,819
What's this?

977
00:32:32,190 --> 00:32:33,190
Did you find something?

978
00:32:33,460 --> 00:32:34,559
What's this?

979
00:32:34,920 --> 00:32:36,660
Let me see.

980
00:32:37,460 --> 00:32:39,960
- "I had fun with my friends today."
- "With my friends today."

981
00:32:39,960 --> 00:32:43,529
- "He watched us pleasantly."
- What?

982
00:32:44,299 --> 00:32:46,369
(I had fun with my friends today.
He watched us pleasantly.)

983
00:32:46,369 --> 00:32:49,670
Remember the gems from earlier?

984
00:32:49,710 --> 00:32:52,880
They had colors.

985
00:32:53,480 --> 00:32:56,309
Right?
They were all different colors.

986
00:32:56,309 --> 00:32:58,009
Right. There were purple,

987
00:32:58,009 --> 00:32:59,650
- pink, and yellow.
- Right?

988
00:32:59,650 --> 00:33:01,250
These match the colors of the gems.

989
00:33:02,019 --> 00:33:03,619
- Right, Ji Hyo?
- You're right.

990
00:33:03,619 --> 00:33:05,390
Right? These are the colors
of the gems.

991
00:33:05,390 --> 00:33:06,920
- Gems from earlier.
- Red too.

992
00:33:06,920 --> 00:33:08,519
The writing.

993
00:33:09,130 --> 00:33:10,829
Let's get going, Ji Hyo.

994
00:33:10,829 --> 00:33:13,529
There's a scarecrow here too.
Is this the children?

995
00:33:14,299 --> 00:33:15,970
- It's not, right?
- I don't think so.

996
00:33:16,900 --> 00:33:18,099
There's a scarecrow over there too.

997
00:33:18,099 --> 00:33:19,170
Where?

998
00:33:19,170 --> 00:33:20,440
(There are scarecrows
all over the village.)

999
00:33:20,440 --> 00:33:24,140
Is this pink?
What's the color of this hat?

1000
00:33:24,140 --> 00:33:25,339
There are too many colors.

1001
00:33:25,609 --> 00:33:27,109
- On this hat.
- There's nothing.

1002
00:33:27,140 --> 00:33:29,079
It looks kind of frightening.

1003
00:33:29,079 --> 00:33:31,450
Why are the pants down?
Is that Kwang Soo?

1004
00:33:31,450 --> 00:33:32,980
He takes his pants off all the time.

1005
00:33:33,619 --> 00:33:35,819
Maybe it does have something to do
with Kwang Soo.

1006
00:33:35,819 --> 00:33:38,319
(They are suspicious of Kwang Soo
for several reasons.)

1007
00:33:38,319 --> 00:33:39,890
- There's a safe.
- Where?

1008
00:33:39,890 --> 00:33:40,890
- This is a safe.
- There's a safe?

1009
00:33:40,890 --> 00:33:42,529
(Meanwhile, Se Chan and So Min...)

1010
00:33:42,529 --> 00:33:43,660
(find a safe...)

1011
00:33:43,660 --> 00:33:44,829
It's on the right.

1012
00:33:44,829 --> 00:33:45,900
(on the 2nd floor of
the village head's house.)

1013
00:33:45,900 --> 00:33:47,259
- My gosh.
- So Min.

1014
00:33:47,259 --> 00:33:48,700
- So Min.
- What?

1015
00:33:48,700 --> 00:33:50,599
- We need a passcode.
- It's locked.

1016
00:33:50,599 --> 00:33:52,640
Don't press random numbers.
You'll get locked out.

1017
00:33:53,170 --> 00:33:54,440
You'll lock it.

1018
00:33:54,440 --> 00:33:55,609
What are you doing?

1019
00:33:55,609 --> 00:33:57,569
- Sorry?
- We did nothing.

1020
00:33:57,609 --> 00:33:58,980
Are you thieves?

1021
00:33:58,980 --> 00:34:00,579
- No, we're not.
- No.

1022
00:34:00,710 --> 00:34:02,380
Why are you in my house?

1023
00:34:02,380 --> 00:34:03,549
- I'm sorry.
- It's the old man.

1024
00:34:03,549 --> 00:34:06,119
Get lost before I kick you out!

1025
00:34:06,119 --> 00:34:07,650
Okay. Sorry, sir.

1026
00:34:07,650 --> 00:34:08,989
(Is the safe keeping a secret?)

1027
00:34:08,989 --> 00:34:10,150
He's mad.

1028
00:34:10,150 --> 00:34:11,150
So Min.

1029
00:34:11,820 --> 00:34:13,920
Sir.

1030
00:34:14,420 --> 00:34:15,989
Why do you think...

1031
00:34:16,429 --> 00:34:18,489
I can't sell this?

1032
00:34:18,489 --> 00:34:20,960
The pawnshop won't take it.

1033
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:22,599
What's this?

1034
00:34:22,599 --> 00:34:24,699
It's a gem.
I dug it up from the field.

1035
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:26,869
It's chocolate.

1036
00:34:27,400 --> 00:34:30,039
Se Chan...

1037
00:34:30,070 --> 00:34:31,639
- Se Chan.
- It's chocolate.

1038
00:34:31,639 --> 00:34:34,010
- It's chocolate?
- Yes, it's chocolate.

1039
00:34:34,010 --> 00:34:35,510
- It's chocolate.
- Se Chan.

1040
00:34:35,510 --> 00:34:38,079
- I'm using the bathroom.
- There's something strange.

1041
00:34:38,079 --> 00:34:40,619
He keeps looking for chocolate.

1042
00:34:40,619 --> 00:34:43,150
(Se Chan, there's something strange.
He keeps looking for chocolate.)

1043
00:34:43,150 --> 00:34:46,090
(He mentioned chocolate
earlier too.)

1044
00:34:48,289 --> 00:34:49,829
- How much do you have?
- What?

1045
00:34:49,829 --> 00:34:51,289
- How much do you have?
- I have one gem.

1046
00:34:52,300 --> 00:34:53,900
Should I get chocolate?
I'll get chocolate.

1047
00:34:53,900 --> 00:34:55,800
- But it's two dollars.
- What?

1048
00:34:55,800 --> 00:34:57,630
- It's two dollars.
- I'm going to exchange it.

1049
00:34:57,630 --> 00:34:59,269
- No, you need money.
- Do you have money?

1050
00:34:59,269 --> 00:35:00,369
- Hold on.
- Let's go together.

1051
00:35:00,369 --> 00:35:02,210
He keeps looking for chocolate.

1052
00:35:02,210 --> 00:35:04,239
Is the scarecrow hiding something?

1053
00:35:04,769 --> 00:35:06,010
This is strange.

1054
00:35:07,039 --> 00:35:11,909
(Seok Jin searches
around the scarecrow.)

1055
00:35:11,909 --> 00:35:13,650
Seok Jin, shall we go
into the building?

1056
00:35:13,650 --> 00:35:14,980
- Let's go inside the building.
- Let's do that.

1057
00:35:16,789 --> 00:35:18,349
Even if we find the key...

1058
00:35:18,349 --> 00:35:19,590
- Kwang Soo.
- Yes?

1059
00:35:19,590 --> 00:35:21,059
Just tell me the truth.
What are you up to today?

1060
00:35:21,059 --> 00:35:22,989
- I'm not doing anything.
- Are you sure?

1061
00:35:23,329 --> 00:35:24,389
Really?

1062
00:35:24,389 --> 00:35:25,900
(They go into the house
looking for the key.)

1063
00:35:25,900 --> 00:35:27,000
- Why?
- What's this?

1064
00:35:27,400 --> 00:35:28,500
(Kwang Soo found a box that
looks like what Se Chan found.)

1065
00:35:28,500 --> 00:35:29,530
This is amazing.

1066
00:35:29,769 --> 00:35:31,000
Let me keep this with me.

1067
00:35:31,530 --> 00:35:32,599
Seok Jin.

1068
00:35:32,639 --> 00:35:34,199
We are on the same boat.

1069
00:35:34,199 --> 00:35:35,639
- Sure. We're a team.
- Seriously.

1070
00:35:35,639 --> 00:35:36,909
- Okay.
- You know what I mean.

1071
00:35:36,909 --> 00:35:38,769
- Gosh, this is...
- We should never be apart.

1072
00:35:38,769 --> 00:35:40,280
- Feeling! Intuition! Cross!
- Feeling! Intuition! Cross!

1073
00:35:40,280 --> 00:35:42,579
If you and I work together,
we will definitely win this race.

1074
00:35:42,650 --> 00:35:44,610
Seok Jin, we should
have one of this each.

1075
00:35:44,610 --> 00:35:45,820
- Okay.
- Seriously.

1076
00:35:46,679 --> 00:35:49,019
What is this? There are things
here and there in the house.

1077
00:35:49,019 --> 00:35:50,489
There are a lot of things.

1078
00:35:51,449 --> 00:35:52,590
What is this?

1079
00:35:52,860 --> 00:35:54,320
I guess it's just a sheet of paper.

1080
00:35:54,860 --> 00:35:56,159
I think it's a clue.

1081
00:35:56,159 --> 00:35:57,289
How should I open this?

1082
00:35:57,730 --> 00:35:58,929
I need a key.

1083
00:35:59,230 --> 00:36:02,429
(And Kwang Soo watches him
look for the key.)

1084
00:36:07,139 --> 00:36:10,170
(Shouting)

1085
00:36:10,170 --> 00:36:12,409
(Seok Jin suddenly cries out.)

1086
00:36:12,409 --> 00:36:14,280
(Ripping)

1087
00:36:14,739 --> 00:36:18,409
(And the thing that's left
in the spot where Seok Jin was...)

1088
00:36:18,409 --> 00:36:21,420
(Victim)

1089
00:36:21,650 --> 00:36:24,650
(Meanwhile, Haha is...)

1090
00:36:24,650 --> 00:36:25,889
It's not working.

1091
00:36:26,389 --> 00:36:27,460
It doesn't work.

1092
00:36:27,460 --> 00:36:29,289
(Haha is doing something
with the gem boxes.)

1093
00:36:29,289 --> 00:36:33,659
(By the way, does he have a key?)

1094
00:36:33,659 --> 00:36:37,530
(What's the key that Haha has?)

1095
00:36:38,329 --> 00:36:40,139
- But we don't have money.
- I have gems.

1096
00:36:40,139 --> 00:36:41,369
You can't use the gems.

1097
00:36:41,369 --> 00:36:43,610
(Se Chan and So Min go to buy
chocolate for the village head.)

1098
00:36:43,639 --> 00:36:45,309
Gosh, what is this?

1099
00:36:46,010 --> 00:36:47,139
What's this?

1100
00:36:47,210 --> 00:36:48,309
They're not here.

1101
00:36:48,840 --> 00:36:50,079
- They're gone.
- Victims?

1102
00:36:50,079 --> 00:36:51,309
- Are they dead?
- They're the people we met earlier.

1103
00:36:52,110 --> 00:36:54,250
Who tore off the name tags?

1104
00:36:54,250 --> 00:36:55,380
Who's doing this?

1105
00:36:55,380 --> 00:36:58,190
(Il Nyeo, E Nyeo, Sa Nyeo are gone
with their name tags left here.)

1106
00:36:58,289 --> 00:36:59,760
Is someone tearing off
the name tags?

1107
00:37:00,190 --> 00:37:01,289
I guess so.

1108
00:37:02,289 --> 00:37:03,389
There are victims.

1109
00:37:03,389 --> 00:37:06,400
(Their name tags say victim
on the other side.)

1110
00:37:07,099 --> 00:37:08,329
Hang on.

1111
00:37:08,860 --> 00:37:10,570
Someone's running around
tearing off the name tags.

1112
00:37:12,469 --> 00:37:14,840
- Take them.
- They are the ladies...

1113
00:37:15,070 --> 00:37:17,039
- we met earlier, right?
- Yes. Il Nyeo, E Nyeo, and Sa Nyeo.

1114
00:37:17,070 --> 00:37:18,710
The three of them
lost their name tags.

1115
00:37:18,769 --> 00:37:19,840
Where's the rest?

1116
00:37:20,179 --> 00:37:21,309
Right. Sa Nyeo.

1117
00:37:21,309 --> 00:37:23,079
- No, Sam Nyeo is not here.
- It's Sam Nyeo.

1118
00:37:23,079 --> 00:37:24,250
We don't have Sam Nyeo's name tag.

1119
00:37:24,250 --> 00:37:25,679
(Sam Nyeo's name is not here.)

1120
00:37:26,780 --> 00:37:29,550
(Sam Nyeo was left alone while
the other three went to Kwang Soo.)

1121
00:37:29,550 --> 00:37:30,789
Let's go, So Min.

1122
00:37:30,920 --> 00:37:34,989
(Where did Kim Sam Nyeo go?)

1123
00:37:35,019 --> 00:37:36,130
Excuse me.

1124
00:37:36,460 --> 00:37:37,760
Did you see Seok Jin?

1125
00:37:37,829 --> 00:37:39,630
- Who's Seok Jin?
- Oh, right.

1126
00:37:39,900 --> 00:37:41,260
(Screaming)

1127
00:37:41,260 --> 00:37:42,400
What's going on?

1128
00:37:43,099 --> 00:37:44,300
Why? What's wrong?

1129
00:37:45,130 --> 00:37:46,239
Gosh, what's that?

1130
00:37:46,699 --> 00:37:47,800
Haha!

1131
00:37:48,039 --> 00:37:49,909
What is this? What's going on?

1132
00:37:49,909 --> 00:37:52,010
(Kwang Ja is lying on the ground,
and Haha is there.)

1133
00:37:52,010 --> 00:37:54,010
- She tried to rip off my name tag.
- Haha!

1134
00:37:54,309 --> 00:37:55,909
- She tried to rip off my name tag.
- Who is that?

1135
00:37:56,909 --> 00:37:58,710
She kept trying
to rip off my name tag.

1136
00:37:58,710 --> 00:38:02,250
(Kwang Soo sees Kwang Ja lying
on the floor without her name tag.)

1137
00:38:02,250 --> 00:38:03,920
She tried to tear off my name tag,
so I took hers.

1138
00:38:03,920 --> 00:38:05,119
(She tried to tear off my name tag,
so I took hers.)

1139
00:38:05,119 --> 00:38:06,389
She kept following me around.

1140
00:38:06,590 --> 00:38:08,789
- Why did you do that to Kwang Ja?
- It has nothing to do with you.

1141
00:38:09,530 --> 00:38:11,360
What's the deal between
Lee Kwang Soo and Lee Kwang Ja?

1142
00:38:12,030 --> 00:38:14,130
- I've never seen her before.
- Then why do you even care?

1143
00:38:14,530 --> 00:38:15,900
It's just strange.

1144
00:38:15,900 --> 00:38:18,730
- From up there...
- Mr. Choi kept watching you.

1145
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:21,300
- I have nothing to do with her.
- It's just strange.

1146
00:38:22,570 --> 00:38:23,809
I have nothing to do with her.

1147
00:38:24,610 --> 00:38:27,139
- Later, you will...
- Why would you care about her?

1148
00:38:27,139 --> 00:38:29,079
I don't care about her.
You just took her name tag off.

1149
00:38:29,349 --> 00:38:30,809
- I don't know.
- You better watch out.

1150
00:38:31,750 --> 00:38:32,949
I don't know anything.

1151
00:38:35,719 --> 00:38:37,389
- Kwang Soo, did you find anything?
- Jae Seok.

1152
00:38:37,389 --> 00:38:38,489
- No?
- The thing is...

1153
00:38:38,690 --> 00:38:40,360
Haha eliminated Kwang Ja.

1154
00:38:40,389 --> 00:38:41,420
What?

1155
00:38:41,420 --> 00:38:43,760
Haha just eliminated Kwang Ja.
She was lying on the ground.

1156
00:38:43,860 --> 00:38:44,929
Why did he eliminate her?

1157
00:38:44,929 --> 00:38:46,360
I don't know.
She's lying on the ground now.

1158
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:48,360
- Why did he eliminate her?
- Did you find anything?

1159
00:38:48,360 --> 00:38:49,400
I don't know.

1160
00:38:49,400 --> 00:38:51,929
Apparently, Kwang Ja attacked
Seok Jin and Haha.

1161
00:38:52,369 --> 00:38:53,570
- Really?
- Yes.

1162
00:38:54,340 --> 00:38:55,599
Where have you been?

1163
00:38:55,599 --> 00:38:57,210
Actually, there was...

1164
00:38:57,239 --> 00:38:58,369
- Hey.
- I was...

1165
00:38:58,909 --> 00:39:01,010
- What?
- I wasn't going to say this,

1166
00:39:01,010 --> 00:39:02,139
but you're being strange now.

1167
00:39:02,340 --> 00:39:04,750
I understand it looks suspicious.

1168
00:39:04,750 --> 00:39:05,920
But I don't have anything.

1169
00:39:06,219 --> 00:39:07,280
And...

1170
00:39:07,280 --> 00:39:08,420
- just now...
- Why does it have to be Kwang Ja?

1171
00:39:08,420 --> 00:39:09,920
I don't know that either.

1172
00:39:10,019 --> 00:39:11,019
So...

1173
00:39:11,019 --> 00:39:12,019
Jae Seok.

1174
00:39:12,119 --> 00:39:14,519
- You're going the wrong way.
- What are you up to?

1175
00:39:14,659 --> 00:39:16,130
I didn't do anything. I'm nothing.

1176
00:39:17,329 --> 00:39:19,400
I have nothing to do with
this village. I've never been here.

1177
00:39:20,099 --> 00:39:23,199
And in the pension
next to this building...

1178
00:39:23,300 --> 00:39:24,900
Get lost.

1179
00:39:25,070 --> 00:39:26,239
(Upset)

1180
00:39:26,239 --> 00:39:28,199
Okay. You're so doomed.

1181
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:30,110
I don't know what it is,

1182
00:39:30,340 --> 00:39:32,039
but if there's a penalty,
you will definitely get it.

1183
00:39:32,239 --> 00:39:33,980
You'll get all wet.

1184
00:39:34,340 --> 00:39:35,409
I just said it involuntarily.

1185
00:39:35,409 --> 00:39:36,809
I just can't help it
when I see your face.

1186
00:39:37,079 --> 00:39:38,750
Do you want me to tell you?

1187
00:39:38,750 --> 00:39:40,380
- You know I didn't mean it.
- Okay.

1188
00:39:40,380 --> 00:39:41,650
I just said it before I knew it.

1189
00:39:41,880 --> 00:39:43,619
- Do you want me to tell you?
- Tell me.

1190
00:39:45,590 --> 00:39:46,619
I stopped it.

1191
00:39:47,789 --> 00:39:49,489
(He stopped his right hand
with his left hand.)

1192
00:39:49,489 --> 00:39:50,659
Before I knew it...

1193
00:39:50,860 --> 00:39:52,900
- You do a lot of strange things.
- I didn't mean to do it.

1194
00:39:52,900 --> 00:39:54,260
I just did it involuntarily.

1195
00:39:54,530 --> 00:39:55,599
I stopped it.

1196
00:39:55,599 --> 00:39:56,630
(I stopped it. Tell me, Kwang Soo.)

1197
00:39:56,630 --> 00:39:57,800
Tell me, Kwang Soo.

1198
00:39:59,539 --> 00:40:01,699
- Do I have to tell you this?
- Just tell me.

1199
00:40:02,840 --> 00:40:04,469
In the next building,

1200
00:40:05,340 --> 00:40:07,679
Seok Jin and I found a box.

1201
00:40:08,210 --> 00:40:10,010
- Really?
- There's another gem box.

1202
00:40:10,179 --> 00:40:11,579
- And does it need a key?
- Yes.

1203
00:40:11,579 --> 00:40:12,780
It's locked.

1204
00:40:14,280 --> 00:40:16,019
And it looks totally
different from this.

1205
00:40:16,019 --> 00:40:17,449
Actually, I found a photo here.

1206
00:40:17,820 --> 00:40:18,949
Look at you.

1207
00:40:19,320 --> 00:40:22,489
(What photo is it?)

1208
00:40:23,260 --> 00:40:24,429
(A little while ago)

1209
00:40:24,429 --> 00:40:26,960
(What?)

1210
00:40:29,170 --> 00:40:30,400
What's this?

1211
00:40:30,530 --> 00:40:32,500
(A group photo of villagers)

1212
00:40:32,500 --> 00:40:34,239
It looks like a family photo.

1213
00:40:35,099 --> 00:40:36,510
Kwang Ja is looking the other way.

1214
00:40:36,510 --> 00:40:38,110
(And what is Kwang Ja staring at?)

1215
00:40:38,110 --> 00:40:40,679
I guess there's a secret
about this village.

1216
00:40:42,239 --> 00:40:43,409
What's this?

1217
00:40:44,880 --> 00:40:46,219
Kwang Ja is looking the other way.

1218
00:40:46,920 --> 00:40:48,119
You're right.

1219
00:40:48,320 --> 00:40:50,219
- They are the villagers.
- He's the pawnbroker.

1220
00:40:50,219 --> 00:40:52,090
- This is Park Cheong Nyeon.
- Cheong Nyeon.

1221
00:40:52,090 --> 00:40:53,820
And she's the supermarket owner.

1222
00:40:53,920 --> 00:40:55,320
- And this is...
- He's the village head.

1223
00:40:55,320 --> 00:40:56,590
(What do Kwang Ja's eyes mean?)

1224
00:41:01,059 --> 00:41:02,230
Isn't this your house?

1225
00:41:02,300 --> 00:41:03,570
Why would it be my house?

1226
00:41:04,300 --> 00:41:05,940
Isn't this your village?

1227
00:41:05,940 --> 00:41:07,500
What are you talking about?

1228
00:41:09,070 --> 00:41:10,469
There must be something.

1229
00:41:11,570 --> 00:41:13,280
What's the thing Seok Jin found?

1230
00:41:14,309 --> 00:41:15,849
Why is Kwang Ja out?

1231
00:41:17,280 --> 00:41:19,320
- She didn't go there.
- Kwang Ja is lying down there.

1232
00:41:19,780 --> 00:41:20,849
Haha eliminated her.

1233
00:41:21,750 --> 00:41:22,920
It's not like that.

1234
00:41:22,920 --> 00:41:24,519
- Why did you eliminate her?
- Listen to me.

1235
00:41:24,519 --> 00:41:26,260
- Why did you do that?
- I'll tell you why.

1236
00:41:26,920 --> 00:41:28,519
She kept coming to me.

1237
00:41:28,960 --> 00:41:30,730
She shook a flower at my face...

1238
00:41:30,730 --> 00:41:32,829
and tried to tear off my name tag
as I turned around.

1239
00:41:32,829 --> 00:41:34,099
I was going to buy her something.

1240
00:41:34,429 --> 00:41:35,599
But she tried to tear it off.

1241
00:41:35,599 --> 00:41:36,769
So I took hers off.

1242
00:41:37,130 --> 00:41:38,130
- And she's out?
- Yes.

1243
00:41:38,130 --> 00:41:39,599
- She fell down when you did it?
- Yes.

1244
00:41:39,969 --> 00:41:41,139
Then he came to me.

1245
00:41:41,340 --> 00:41:42,739
- Do you know what he said to me?
- What did he say?

1246
00:41:43,039 --> 00:41:45,070
He sounded
as if I harmed his family.

1247
00:41:45,369 --> 00:41:46,409
"Why did you do it?"

1248
00:41:46,739 --> 00:41:48,340
It didn't sound anything like that.

1249
00:41:48,510 --> 00:41:49,610
"Why did you do that to Kwang Ja?"

1250
00:41:49,610 --> 00:41:51,980
- Why would you think that way?
- He kept talking to me like that.

1251
00:41:51,980 --> 00:41:53,650
- His family...
- No. That's enough, Haha.

1252
00:41:54,849 --> 00:41:55,989
I figured it out.

1253
00:41:55,989 --> 00:41:57,119
What are you doing?

1254
00:41:57,889 --> 00:41:58,989
I figured it out.

1255
00:41:58,989 --> 00:41:59,989
What are you doing?

1256
00:42:00,960 --> 00:42:02,119
What's up with you?

1257
00:42:02,420 --> 00:42:03,989
Why are you pretending
to be so sharp?

1258
00:42:04,190 --> 00:42:05,360
I'm the protagonist of this episode.

1259
00:42:05,360 --> 00:42:06,929
(I'm the protagonist
of this episode.)

1260
00:42:06,929 --> 00:42:08,530
- Why?
- Why?

1261
00:42:09,199 --> 00:42:12,599
I feel like I should unravel
the whole mystery here.

1262
00:42:13,699 --> 00:42:14,699
We should eliminate him.

1263
00:42:17,670 --> 00:42:18,909
Isn't it strange?

1264
00:42:18,909 --> 00:42:20,239
(While they have
an exhausting conversation...)

1265
00:42:20,239 --> 00:42:21,409
Haha.

1266
00:42:21,840 --> 00:42:23,650
- We almost figured it out.
- What?

1267
00:42:23,650 --> 00:42:25,380
Did you see this, guys?

1268
00:42:25,809 --> 00:42:27,619
What's that? What's a victim?

1269
00:42:27,619 --> 00:42:29,449
The ladies are gone.

1270
00:42:29,449 --> 00:42:31,590
- Did you take them off?
- No. I found them on the ground.

1271
00:42:32,719 --> 00:42:34,820
- What's this?
- Haha, we need something sweet.

1272
00:42:35,190 --> 00:42:36,530
You and I should...

1273
00:42:36,829 --> 00:42:38,929
- get the village head something.
- To whom?

1274
00:42:39,090 --> 00:42:40,630
- You got money, didn't you?
- To the village head?

1275
00:42:40,760 --> 00:42:43,670
- If we get him some chocolate...
- He will give us a hint.

1276
00:42:43,829 --> 00:42:45,329
- What?
- We need chocolate.

1277
00:42:45,630 --> 00:42:46,739
How much is the chocolate?

1278
00:42:47,239 --> 00:42:48,900
It's one dollar.

1279
00:42:48,900 --> 00:42:50,309
One dollar? Thank you.

1280
00:42:50,369 --> 00:42:52,039
- Really?
- Excuse me.

1281
00:42:52,039 --> 00:42:53,409
How come you're all out
of tissue boxes?

1282
00:42:53,739 --> 00:42:54,909
Tissue boxes?

1283
00:42:54,909 --> 00:42:57,480
It's because of the virus.

1284
00:42:57,480 --> 00:42:59,920
People buy a lot of tissue
these days.

1285
00:42:59,920 --> 00:43:01,250
But I didn't get extra.

1286
00:43:01,250 --> 00:43:02,619
It's the only thing that's sold out.

1287
00:43:02,849 --> 00:43:04,219
- Why is it sold out?
- I told you.

1288
00:43:04,289 --> 00:43:06,090
It's because of the virus.

1289
00:43:06,159 --> 00:43:07,320
My gosh.

1290
00:43:07,320 --> 00:43:08,559
(Something's strange.)

1291
00:43:11,260 --> 00:43:12,429
What is this?

1292
00:43:12,429 --> 00:43:14,300
(Se Chan and So Min find something
on their way to the village head.)

1293
00:43:14,300 --> 00:43:16,599
- What is this ddakji?
- What's that?

1294
00:43:18,170 --> 00:43:20,940
(This ddakji is...)

1295
00:43:20,940 --> 00:43:25,110
(what Kwang Ja played with.)

1296
00:43:26,980 --> 00:43:28,139
It's a letter.

1297
00:43:28,139 --> 00:43:29,449
It says something. Let's go.

1298
00:43:30,110 --> 00:43:31,349
Read it.

1299
00:43:31,349 --> 00:43:33,519
(The letter says...)

1300
00:43:33,519 --> 00:43:35,119
"May 1, 2019."

1301
00:43:35,219 --> 00:43:37,889
"If what I found out is true,"

1302
00:43:37,889 --> 00:43:39,960
"those who were
tempted by the diamonds..."

1303
00:43:39,960 --> 00:43:42,260
"will soon be eliminated by him."

1304
00:43:42,360 --> 00:43:44,559
"Figure out a way to eliminate him
as soon as possible..."

1305
00:43:44,559 --> 00:43:46,030
"and share it with people."

1306
00:43:46,030 --> 00:43:47,460
(It's a reporter's note
about the elimination.)

1307
00:43:47,460 --> 00:43:48,760
- Does this say anything?
- No.

1308
00:43:48,760 --> 00:43:49,869
Then...

1309
00:43:50,429 --> 00:43:53,099
We will get eliminated
if we become greedy.

1310
00:43:53,739 --> 00:43:55,440
It says "those who were
tempted by the diamonds".

1311
00:43:55,440 --> 00:43:56,969
Jae Seok, I found a letter.

1312
00:43:56,969 --> 00:43:58,139
(I should tell them quickly.)

1313
00:43:58,139 --> 00:43:59,309
Who is it?

1314
00:43:59,309 --> 00:44:00,940
- I'm sure someone's here.
- There's someone.

1315
00:44:00,940 --> 00:44:02,309
- My gosh.
- What?

1316
00:44:02,309 --> 00:44:03,480
What's that sound?

1317
00:44:03,679 --> 00:44:04,849
- My gosh.
- What?

1318
00:44:05,150 --> 00:44:07,079
(Kwang Soo found...)

1319
00:44:07,079 --> 00:44:08,320
- Jae Seok.
- What?

1320
00:44:08,320 --> 00:44:10,449
(Seok Jin's name tag.)

1321
00:44:10,449 --> 00:44:11,590
Why?

1322
00:44:13,889 --> 00:44:15,989
(Is Seok Jin eliminated?)

1323
00:44:15,989 --> 00:44:17,130
What's that?

1324
00:44:18,360 --> 00:44:19,559
- What happened to Seok Jin?
- Look at this.

1325
00:44:19,699 --> 00:44:20,929
- What? Seok Jin.
- What's going on?

1326
00:44:20,929 --> 00:44:22,130
Seok Jin is a victim.

1327
00:44:22,130 --> 00:44:23,900
- Jae Seok.
- You mean Seok Jin?

1328
00:44:24,230 --> 00:44:26,000
I was right about that.

1329
00:44:26,269 --> 00:44:28,539
What I said in the car is right.
It's just like a movie.

1330
00:44:28,539 --> 00:44:30,769
- We will die one by one?
- I said we'd die one by one.

1331
00:44:31,070 --> 00:44:33,010
I told you.
Seok Jin or Kwang Soo would die.

1332
00:44:33,010 --> 00:44:34,079
(His joke is coming true.)

1333
00:44:34,079 --> 00:44:36,150
- The balloon.
- I found this letter.

1334
00:44:36,150 --> 00:44:38,980
"May 1, 2019.
If what I found out is true..."

1335
00:44:39,210 --> 00:44:40,519
Look at this.

1336
00:44:41,219 --> 00:44:42,550
It means there's someone.

1337
00:44:43,119 --> 00:44:44,320
We don't have time.

1338
00:44:45,989 --> 00:44:47,420
What is going on?

1339
00:44:47,420 --> 00:44:48,489
(There's someone who's going
after the members' name tags.)

1340
00:44:48,489 --> 00:44:51,090
I think there's a secret
about this village.

1341
00:44:51,460 --> 00:44:54,460
I'm sure our routes overlap here.

1342
00:44:54,460 --> 00:44:56,699
(I should be careful
not to be eliminated here.)

1343
00:44:57,900 --> 00:45:00,000
(Se Chan is back at the village
head's house with chocolate.)

1344
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:01,170
Sir.

1345
00:45:03,010 --> 00:45:04,039
Sir.

1346
00:45:04,309 --> 00:45:05,639
I brought chocolate.

1347
00:45:08,280 --> 00:45:10,909
(He suddenly grabs the chocolate.)

1348
00:45:10,909 --> 00:45:13,050
(The village head takes
the chocolate.)

1349
00:45:13,449 --> 00:45:17,719
(Is chocolate the key
that will open his mouth?)

1350
00:45:17,719 --> 00:45:18,989
Do you have anything to say?

1351
00:45:18,989 --> 00:45:24,260
(Do you have anything to say?)

1352
00:45:26,030 --> 00:45:27,760
(Shaking his head)

1353
00:45:29,500 --> 00:45:31,199
Was it just an ad-lib?

1354
00:45:31,199 --> 00:45:32,500
But chocolate...

1355
00:45:32,570 --> 00:45:34,940
Sir. Did you just want
something sweet?

1356
00:45:35,940 --> 00:45:39,710
(The village head simply wanted
something sweet.)

1357
00:45:40,610 --> 00:45:43,849
- Is that it?
- I don't know anything.

1358
00:45:45,309 --> 00:45:47,719
- Gosh, my dollar.
- I don't know anything.

1359
00:45:47,719 --> 00:45:48,980
Mr. Choi.

1360
00:45:48,980 --> 00:45:50,389
(So Min also brings chocolate
for the village head.)

1361
00:45:50,389 --> 00:45:51,750
Se Chan.

1362
00:45:53,760 --> 00:45:54,989
(I hope this chocolate will unlock
the secret.)

1363
00:45:54,989 --> 00:45:56,159
Chocolate.

1364
00:45:56,159 --> 00:45:57,360
(I hope this chocolate will unlock
the secret.)

1365
00:45:58,130 --> 00:45:59,599
(He ran out of ad-libs.)

1366
00:45:59,760 --> 00:46:01,099
- So Min.
- Yes?

1367
00:46:01,099 --> 00:46:03,199
It was an ad-lib.

1368
00:46:03,199 --> 00:46:05,769
(It was an ad-lib.)

1369
00:46:05,769 --> 00:46:09,809
(The village head is low
on sugar and ad-libs.)

1370
00:46:11,110 --> 00:46:12,239
(He got me.)

1371
00:46:12,239 --> 00:46:13,510
- Hey.
- Mr. Choi

1372
00:46:14,679 --> 00:46:16,309
You and I got fooled.

1373
00:46:17,280 --> 00:46:18,579
- Grandpa.
- I give up.

1374
00:46:18,579 --> 00:46:21,880
- Did you simply want chocolate?
- I don't know anything.

1375
00:46:21,880 --> 00:46:23,320
- Is it unrelated to the plot?
- I don't know.

1376
00:46:23,519 --> 00:46:25,590
My wife likes it.

1377
00:46:26,119 --> 00:46:27,860
(Laughing)

1378
00:46:27,860 --> 00:46:29,559
- Are you sure there is nothing?
- There is nothing.

1379
00:46:29,559 --> 00:46:30,659
This is hard.

1380
00:46:30,730 --> 00:46:32,190
Kwang Ja disappeared.

1381
00:46:32,190 --> 00:46:33,360
(Haha ripped off Kwang Ja's name tag
in this garden.)

1382
00:46:33,360 --> 00:46:34,429
What is that?

1383
00:46:34,429 --> 00:46:37,630
(Kwang Ja disappeared.)

1384
00:46:38,829 --> 00:46:40,570
That's Kwang Ja's name tag.

1385
00:46:40,570 --> 00:46:42,440
(Only Kwang Ja's name tag remains.)

1386
00:46:42,440 --> 00:46:43,869
- Isn't that Kwang Ja's name tag?
- Yes, it is.

1387
00:46:43,869 --> 00:46:45,139
- Haha...
- What?

1388
00:46:45,139 --> 00:46:46,309
What is it?

1389
00:46:46,309 --> 00:46:49,550
(There is something
on the back of the name tag!)

1390
00:46:49,679 --> 00:46:51,079
What is this?

1391
00:46:51,650 --> 00:46:52,780
It's a children's song.

1392
00:46:52,780 --> 00:46:56,349
(There are lyrics
on the back of Kwang Ja's name tag.)

1393
00:46:57,389 --> 00:47:01,619
(Haha ripped off Kwang Ja's name tag
and saw the hint.)

1394
00:47:02,820 --> 00:47:04,760
(Why did Haha hide the hint?)

1395
00:47:04,760 --> 00:47:07,400
Does Kim Ga Gae's name tag have
a clue as well?

1396
00:47:07,400 --> 00:47:09,929
(The owner of the stall)

1397
00:47:09,929 --> 00:47:11,300
- Could that be the case?
- Right?

1398
00:47:12,829 --> 00:47:15,769
People in the photo
must have hints in their name tags.

1399
00:47:15,769 --> 00:47:16,840
Kwang Ja and...

1400
00:47:16,840 --> 00:47:18,409
Should we remove
Kim Ga Gae's name tag?

1401
00:47:18,869 --> 00:47:20,480
Let's go.

1402
00:47:20,610 --> 00:47:24,010
I don't know if we can tell
other people about this.

1403
00:47:24,010 --> 00:47:25,679
- You are back.
- Yes, Ma'am.

1404
00:47:25,679 --> 00:47:27,320
- Jae Seok, will you buy something?
- Well...

1405
00:47:27,320 --> 00:47:28,480
Do you want a fish cake bar?

1406
00:47:28,480 --> 00:47:30,289
- How much is coffee?
- It's a dollar.

1407
00:47:30,289 --> 00:47:31,519
- A dollar?
- Yes.

1408
00:47:31,519 --> 00:47:32,719
It's hot.

1409
00:47:32,719 --> 00:47:35,860
(Ripping off)

1410
00:47:36,630 --> 00:47:37,889
Why did you rip off her name tag?

1411
00:47:38,059 --> 00:47:39,659
Why did you rip off her name tag?

1412
00:47:41,300 --> 00:47:44,070
(Kwang Soo ripped off
Kim Ga Gae's name tag.)

1413
00:47:44,070 --> 00:47:45,800
(What's behind the name tag?)

1414
00:47:45,800 --> 00:47:47,300
- Kwang Soo ripped off her name tag.
- Whose name tag?

1415
00:47:47,300 --> 00:47:48,539
The stall owner.

1416
00:47:51,110 --> 00:47:52,639
- "Sold out".
- "Sold out"?

1417
00:47:54,039 --> 00:47:55,639
(The hint behind her name tag is
"Sold out".)

1418
00:47:55,639 --> 00:47:57,380
What does that mean?

1419
00:47:57,380 --> 00:47:59,309
Why does it say "Sold out"?

1420
00:47:59,619 --> 00:48:01,150
Why did you rip off her name tag?

1421
00:48:02,320 --> 00:48:03,650
- Jong Kook.
- What is up with the two of you?

1422
00:48:03,650 --> 00:48:04,750
What is going on?

1423
00:48:04,949 --> 00:48:06,289
Hold on.

1424
00:48:06,289 --> 00:48:07,389
- What's sold out?
- Sold out?

1425
00:48:07,389 --> 00:48:09,730
- What?
- The tissue box is sold out.

1426
00:48:09,730 --> 00:48:10,789
Here it is.

1427
00:48:12,090 --> 00:48:13,900
Hold on.

1428
00:48:13,900 --> 00:48:15,829
We don't have time to do this.

1429
00:48:15,829 --> 00:48:16,829
(These greedy ones
are undisciplined.)

1430
00:48:18,130 --> 00:48:19,500
Where are you going?

1431
00:48:20,400 --> 00:48:22,139
They are so greedy.

1432
00:48:24,210 --> 00:48:25,510
There must be something inside.

1433
00:48:26,039 --> 00:48:28,239
The sign read
that the tissue box is sold out.

1434
00:48:29,280 --> 00:48:30,510
What could this be?

1435
00:48:30,510 --> 00:48:32,349
(They hide in a corner
and look for a hint.)

1436
00:48:33,750 --> 00:48:35,880
- Is there anything inside?
- There is nothing inside.

1437
00:48:35,880 --> 00:48:37,519
This has to mean something.

1438
00:48:38,150 --> 00:48:40,489
The sign read
that the tissue box is sold out.

1439
00:48:41,159 --> 00:48:42,519
How strange!

1440
00:48:42,519 --> 00:48:44,659
(He searches thoroughly.)

1441
00:48:44,659 --> 00:48:46,159
Tissue box was the only one
that was sold out. What?

1442
00:48:46,159 --> 00:48:47,199
(A hand?)

1443
00:48:47,199 --> 00:48:49,260
(Jae Seok suddenly slaps Kwang Soo.)

1444
00:48:50,429 --> 00:48:51,869
(Why did you slap me?)

1445
00:48:51,869 --> 00:48:53,969
- What was that?
- I got back at you. We are even.

1446
00:48:54,199 --> 00:48:55,400
My goodness.

1447
00:48:55,739 --> 00:48:57,409
- There is nothing.
- Does this mean nothing?

1448
00:48:57,409 --> 00:48:59,340
Why did the hint say "Sold out"?

1449
00:48:59,679 --> 00:49:01,179
For goodness' sake.

1450
00:49:01,880 --> 00:49:03,409
Let's visit the village head
one more time.

1451
00:49:03,409 --> 00:49:04,449
(They have no choice but to move.)

1452
00:49:04,449 --> 00:49:05,579
Is there a different approach?

1453
00:49:05,880 --> 00:49:08,349
(He sends Jae Seok away.)

1454
00:49:09,179 --> 00:49:13,760
(Kwang Soo searches the stall
thoroughly.)

1455
00:49:13,760 --> 00:49:15,920
(However)

1456
00:49:16,219 --> 00:49:17,960
(There is a note
deep inside the tissue box.)

1457
00:49:17,960 --> 00:49:19,429
(The witness' number)

1458
00:49:19,429 --> 00:49:23,170
(The witness' number is written
on the note.)

1459
00:49:24,130 --> 00:49:26,469
(His eyes go wide.)

1460
00:49:26,469 --> 00:49:27,570
What?

1461
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:29,440
It's the witness' number.

1462
00:49:30,139 --> 00:49:31,710
Hold on. I should call this number.

1463
00:49:33,039 --> 00:49:35,739
(Kwang Soo doesn't want
to share the information.)

1464
00:49:35,739 --> 00:49:38,980
(He finds a safe spot.)

1465
00:49:41,050 --> 00:49:44,889
(He tries calling
the witness' number.)

1466
00:49:44,889 --> 00:49:46,289
(He hears the ringtone.)

1467
00:49:47,420 --> 00:49:49,460
- Hello?
- Hello.

1468
00:49:49,829 --> 00:49:53,699
Hello. Are you the witness?

1469
00:49:53,760 --> 00:49:54,960
Who are you?

1470
00:49:55,059 --> 00:49:58,099
I told the reporter everything.

1471
00:49:58,099 --> 00:50:00,000
Should I tell you
what happened again?

1472
00:50:00,840 --> 00:50:03,570
Yes, yes. Please tell me
what happened again.

1473
00:50:04,610 --> 00:50:08,679
My friends and I visited
Gujeon Village two years ago.

1474
00:50:08,679 --> 00:50:11,150
One friend found a gem box.

1475
00:50:11,150 --> 00:50:13,079
(One friend found a gem box.)

1476
00:50:14,280 --> 00:50:17,789
We were looking around the village
in search of a key...

1477
00:50:17,789 --> 00:50:19,860
when we suddenly heard
my friend's scream.

1478
00:50:19,960 --> 00:50:22,860
When we ran over,
someone was attacking my friend.

1479
00:50:23,829 --> 00:50:27,659
That person was strong enough
to rip off the name tag at once.

1480
00:50:27,659 --> 00:50:29,400
(A strong person who can rip off
the name tag at once)

1481
00:50:29,400 --> 00:50:31,570
I couldn't get a good look
since that person was so fast.

1482
00:50:31,829 --> 00:50:35,440
When we ran away in surprise,
that person didn't follow us...

1483
00:50:35,440 --> 00:50:37,809
despite being fast enough
to rip off my name tag.

1484
00:50:37,969 --> 00:50:40,840
I just remembered something.

1485
00:50:40,840 --> 00:50:42,539
(The witness remembered something.)

1486
00:50:42,539 --> 00:50:46,050
My friend didn't even let us touch
the gem box.

1487
00:50:47,079 --> 00:50:49,320
Perhaps it was unlucky.

1488
00:50:49,320 --> 00:50:50,989
(Did her friend want the gem box
for herself?)

1489
00:50:51,190 --> 00:50:54,820
(Everyone tried to touch
the gem box earlier.)

1490
00:50:55,320 --> 00:50:58,960
I don't want to think about it.
I am hanging up. I am sorry.

1491
00:51:00,099 --> 00:51:01,530
But... Hello?

1492
00:51:01,530 --> 00:51:03,699
(The witness gets scared
and hangs up.)

1493
00:51:07,369 --> 00:51:10,440
(Ji Hyo is looking for hints
by herself.)

1494
00:51:12,309 --> 00:51:13,380
What is this?

1495
00:51:15,210 --> 00:51:16,579
Is it a hint?

1496
00:51:16,579 --> 00:51:18,480
(She comes across a camera.)

1497
00:51:19,510 --> 00:51:20,579
What?

1498
00:51:22,219 --> 00:51:24,389
(Inside the camera...)

1499
00:51:24,389 --> 00:51:28,690
(are the photos
of various parts of Gujeon Village.)

1500
00:51:29,929 --> 00:51:33,829
(What do these photos mean?)

1501
00:51:36,969 --> 00:51:38,030
What?

1502
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:41,039
(Screaming)

1503
00:51:41,039 --> 00:51:44,809
(Ji Hyo disappears with a scream.)

1504
00:51:44,809 --> 00:51:48,510
(Victim)

1505
00:51:48,780 --> 00:51:51,409
(Two members are eliminated
without a sound.)

1506
00:51:51,750 --> 00:51:54,119
Where is everyone?
Why is no one around?

1507
00:51:55,250 --> 00:51:57,489
Where is everyone?
Why is no one around?

1508
00:51:59,590 --> 00:52:00,920
Kwang Soo, what are you doing?

1509
00:52:02,090 --> 00:52:04,530
(He acts like nothing has happened.)

1510
00:52:05,489 --> 00:52:06,599
Did you poop?

1511
00:52:08,059 --> 00:52:09,360
Why would I poop?

1512
00:52:09,869 --> 00:52:11,530
- Why would I poop on the camera?
- But you were like...

1513
00:52:12,300 --> 00:52:14,099
I was just sitting down.
I didn't pull down my pants.

1514
00:52:14,099 --> 00:52:15,969
I didn't pull down my pants.

1515
00:52:16,869 --> 00:52:18,170
Did you find something?

1516
00:52:19,239 --> 00:52:20,739
- I have something.
- What is it?

1517
00:52:21,510 --> 00:52:23,510
Give me a hint.
What I found is really important.

1518
00:52:23,510 --> 00:52:24,750
I will show you.

1519
00:52:24,750 --> 00:52:25,909
Let's take it out at the same time.

1520
00:52:25,909 --> 00:52:27,320
(They agree to take it out
at the same time.)

1521
00:52:27,320 --> 00:52:29,650
- Will you show me? Is it important?
- Yes.

1522
00:52:29,650 --> 00:52:31,449
1, 2, 3.

1523
00:52:31,650 --> 00:52:33,789
(Here is chocolate.)

1524
00:52:33,889 --> 00:52:35,820
- What is that? It's important.
- Forget it. Hey.

1525
00:52:35,820 --> 00:52:37,190
- It's important.
- What is that?

1526
00:52:37,190 --> 00:52:38,860
Go ahead and tell me.

1527
00:52:38,860 --> 00:52:40,130
What is that chocolate?

1528
00:52:40,159 --> 00:52:41,159
What is that chocolate? Tell me.

1529
00:52:41,159 --> 00:52:43,300
- It's really important.
- What is it?

1530
00:52:43,300 --> 00:52:45,929
- The village head kept saying it.
- What did he say?

1531
00:52:46,230 --> 00:52:48,699
"I will eat chocolate."

1532
00:52:48,699 --> 00:52:51,010
"I will eat it later."

1533
00:52:52,840 --> 00:52:54,780
- What are you playing at?
- I am serious. Go to him.

1534
00:52:54,840 --> 00:52:56,139
I am serious.

1535
00:52:57,050 --> 00:52:58,650
You haven't changed at all,
have you?

1536
00:52:58,780 --> 00:53:01,480
You have no intention to cooperate.

1537
00:53:01,579 --> 00:53:04,590
The village head said,
"I will eat chocolate."

1538
00:53:04,590 --> 00:53:06,619
- "I will eat it later."
- In any case...

1539
00:53:06,619 --> 00:53:09,590
He is eating so much chocolate.
He won't leave his spot.

1540
00:53:09,590 --> 00:53:13,400
I think we should join forces
and solve the problem at hand.

1541
00:53:13,400 --> 00:53:15,199
- Really?
- Let me tell you one more thing.

1542
00:53:15,199 --> 00:53:16,730
It's about Kwang Ja.

1543
00:53:16,730 --> 00:53:19,329
On her name tag
is a children's song.

1544
00:53:19,429 --> 00:53:20,739
- A children's song?
- Yes.

1545
00:53:20,739 --> 00:53:22,000
The lyrics of a children's song.

1546
00:53:22,039 --> 00:53:23,309
Which one?

1547
00:53:23,309 --> 00:53:24,510
I am sure you know it.

1548
00:53:24,510 --> 00:53:28,239
The faces of angels and fairies

1549
00:53:28,239 --> 00:53:30,150
- I know it.
- What was the title?

1550
00:53:30,150 --> 00:53:31,250
"Hill".

1551
00:53:32,050 --> 00:53:35,880
"I go up the hill
to look up at the blue sky..."

1552
00:53:37,050 --> 00:53:38,719
(Meanwhile,
at the house of the village head)

1553
00:53:38,719 --> 00:53:41,059
- You read it, right?
- Yes.

1554
00:53:41,159 --> 00:53:43,590
Haha, you didn't read
the note, did you?

1555
00:53:43,590 --> 00:53:45,030
I didn't get to read it carefully.

1556
00:53:46,429 --> 00:53:47,860
It talked about...

1557
00:53:48,360 --> 00:53:51,400
how you will become eliminated...

1558
00:53:51,400 --> 00:53:53,170
if you fall for the diamond.

1559
00:53:53,170 --> 00:53:54,440
(Those who fall for the diamond
will get eliminated.)

1560
00:53:54,440 --> 00:53:57,210
We came here...

1561
00:53:57,210 --> 00:54:02,280
because So Min invited us.

1562
00:54:04,980 --> 00:54:06,110
Hey.

1563
00:54:06,449 --> 00:54:08,780
Is So Min the one
who is seducing us...

1564
00:54:08,780 --> 00:54:10,820
with the diamond?

1565
00:54:12,349 --> 00:54:13,659
It says invitation.

1566
00:54:13,659 --> 00:54:16,659
(So Min sent them an invitation
to Gujeon Village.)

1567
00:54:17,159 --> 00:54:20,230
(There's this fantastic land where
I can dig up huge diamonds.)

1568
00:54:20,960 --> 00:54:24,199
(So Min lured them
with a promise of diamonds.)

1569
00:54:24,829 --> 00:54:28,469
When someone makes a comeback,
he or she prepares a special...

1570
00:54:28,500 --> 00:54:30,369
- Everyone does it for a surprise.
- That's right.

1571
00:54:30,369 --> 00:54:31,369
Yes.

1572
00:54:31,869 --> 00:54:33,880
So Min is acting like
she isn't behind this.

1573
00:54:33,880 --> 00:54:36,510
She is acting like
this is a mistake.

1574
00:54:36,510 --> 00:54:38,079
- "I don't know anything."
- To be honest,

1575
00:54:38,079 --> 00:54:40,820
what I said back in the car
was directed at So Min.

1576
00:54:40,820 --> 00:54:42,019
- Really?
- That's right.

1577
00:54:42,019 --> 00:54:43,719
Jae Seok, don't lie.

1578
00:54:43,949 --> 00:54:45,750
- Don't pretend to be sharp.
- Why...

1579
00:54:46,289 --> 00:54:48,489
Why did you interfere
when Se Chan almost fell for it?

1580
00:54:48,719 --> 00:54:50,230
Keep your mouth shut!

1581
00:54:50,530 --> 00:54:51,559
He knows you too well.

1582
00:54:51,559 --> 00:54:53,900
- Se Chan was like, "Oh?"
- I was like, "Oh?"

1583
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:55,530
- For goodness' sake.
- Hold on!

1584
00:54:55,530 --> 00:54:57,500
(Hold on!)

1585
00:54:58,130 --> 00:54:59,699
Does the password have six digits?

1586
00:55:00,639 --> 00:55:03,170
Sitting there
won't help you find the password.

1587
00:55:04,309 --> 00:55:06,110
When is So Min's birthday?

1588
00:55:06,639 --> 00:55:09,010
- They wouldn't have used it again.
- Gosh.

1589
00:55:09,010 --> 00:55:10,110
You are a bit...

1590
00:55:10,409 --> 00:55:12,110
You have no basic skills
in deducting.

1591
00:55:12,110 --> 00:55:14,449
He hasn't been in a lot of
those shows, so he doesn't know.

1592
00:55:15,179 --> 00:55:17,489
They wouldn't use
the same information again.

1593
00:55:17,489 --> 00:55:18,619
Come on down.

1594
00:55:21,760 --> 00:55:23,489
(Why are you guys so expectant?)

1595
00:55:23,960 --> 00:55:25,360
Why are you guys so expectant?

1596
00:55:25,360 --> 00:55:27,030
(Their eyes were about to pop out.)

1597
00:55:27,760 --> 00:55:28,929
I thought it might open.

1598
00:55:28,929 --> 00:55:31,630
Why are you guys so expectant
to see it open?

1599
00:55:32,099 --> 00:55:34,000
I think So Min is behind this.

1600
00:55:34,239 --> 00:55:36,000
- There is something about So Min.
- I know.

1601
00:55:36,739 --> 00:55:38,670
I don't know what this hint means.

1602
00:55:38,670 --> 00:55:39,840
- Why...
- What does "Sold out" mean?

1603
00:55:39,840 --> 00:55:42,110
Why does the tissue box... What?

1604
00:55:42,409 --> 00:55:43,679
The tissue box is sold out.

1605
00:55:43,809 --> 00:55:45,150
There is an open one.

1606
00:55:45,150 --> 00:55:47,119
Jae Seok and I looked inside,
but there was nothing.

1607
00:55:50,489 --> 00:55:52,150
Do you expect me to believe that?

1608
00:55:52,320 --> 00:55:53,349
Yes.

1609
00:55:53,590 --> 00:55:56,360
(She suddenly attacks Kwang Soo.)

1610
00:55:56,360 --> 00:55:57,489
What?

1611
00:55:57,630 --> 00:55:58,860
What?

1612
00:55:58,860 --> 00:56:00,599
What? What are you hiding?

1613
00:56:00,599 --> 00:56:01,630
- What's inside?
- What?

1614
00:56:01,630 --> 00:56:03,000
- What's inside?
- There is nothing inside.

1615
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:04,000
- It's my bag.
- Then why can't I see inside?

1616
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:05,869
Why can't I look inside?

1617
00:56:05,869 --> 00:56:07,440
Why can't I look inside?

1618
00:56:07,440 --> 00:56:08,599
Do you want
to get your name tag ripped off?

1619
00:56:08,599 --> 00:56:10,739
(Do you want
to get your name tag ripped off?)

1620
00:56:11,269 --> 00:56:12,840
Rip it off. Rip it off.

1621
00:56:12,840 --> 00:56:14,239
Rip it off. That has happened
many times.

1622
00:56:14,239 --> 00:56:15,980
Why can't I look inside?
You said there's nothing.

1623
00:56:15,980 --> 00:56:17,610
What's that note? I have seen it.

1624
00:56:17,610 --> 00:56:19,010
Isn't it a reporter's note?

1625
00:56:19,010 --> 00:56:20,519
- A reporter's note?
- That's right.

1626
00:56:20,820 --> 00:56:21,820
Isn't it the one from earlier?

1627
00:56:21,820 --> 00:56:22,849
- No.
- Let me see it.

1628
00:56:22,849 --> 00:56:24,590
Come on. Don't be like that.

1629
00:56:24,590 --> 00:56:25,989
What is it?

1630
00:56:25,989 --> 00:56:27,619
Why are you hiding it?

1631
00:56:28,719 --> 00:56:29,719
(She continues to go
after Kwang Soo.)

1632
00:56:29,719 --> 00:56:31,659
- I don't have anything.
- Hey!

1633
00:56:31,659 --> 00:56:33,230
Why did you put it in there?

1634
00:56:33,230 --> 00:56:35,130
- I don't have anything!
- Why did you put it near your butt?

1635
00:56:35,130 --> 00:56:36,329
I don't have anything!

1636
00:56:36,329 --> 00:56:37,400
Why won't you show me the note?

1637
00:56:37,400 --> 00:56:39,199
I don't have anything! What note?

1638
00:56:39,530 --> 00:56:41,269
What is wrong with you?

1639
00:56:42,039 --> 00:56:44,309
- What is wrong with you?
- Why won't you let me see it?

1640
00:56:44,309 --> 00:56:45,510
I don't have it.

1641
00:56:45,510 --> 00:56:46,639
I don't have it!

1642
00:56:47,579 --> 00:56:49,909
Then why did you touch your butt?
Why did you put your hand in there?

1643
00:56:50,349 --> 00:56:51,380
It's a habit.

1644
00:56:51,380 --> 00:56:53,010
- You put your hand in there.
- Hey!

1645
00:56:53,010 --> 00:56:54,079
What are you doing?

1646
00:56:54,820 --> 00:56:56,619
What is up with them?
What's going on?

1647
00:56:58,550 --> 00:57:00,289
(Kwang Soo tries to trip her.)

1648
00:57:00,289 --> 00:57:02,820
Stop it. Stop it.

1649
00:57:02,820 --> 00:57:04,360
(So Min grabs Kwang Soo
by his hair.)

1650
00:57:05,289 --> 00:57:06,730
- Give it to me.
- I don't have anything.

1651
00:57:06,730 --> 00:57:08,030
- Hurry up.
- Let go.

1652
00:57:08,030 --> 00:57:09,030
- Show me.
- Let go.

1653
00:57:09,030 --> 00:57:10,630
- Let go.
- Let go. Let go first.

1654
00:57:10,630 --> 00:57:12,429
- Let go.
- Let go on the count of three.

1655
00:57:12,429 --> 00:57:13,840
- What do you have?
- Let go on the count of three.

1656
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:15,539
1, 2, 3.

1657
00:57:15,539 --> 00:57:17,369
(The negotiation falls through!)

1658
00:57:17,840 --> 00:57:19,039
(So Min became so healthy.)

1659
00:57:19,039 --> 00:57:20,940
Show me. Why won't you show me?

1660
00:57:20,940 --> 00:57:22,039
Let go.

1661
00:57:22,039 --> 00:57:24,409
What are you doing?
I can't believe you guys.

1662
00:57:24,409 --> 00:57:25,809
Let go. I can't show you
unless you let go.

1663
00:57:25,809 --> 00:57:27,550
- I can't show you.
- I let go.

1664
00:57:27,719 --> 00:57:28,820
- I let go.
- Let go.

1665
00:57:28,820 --> 00:57:30,289
- I let go.
- Slowly.

1666
00:57:30,289 --> 00:57:31,420
Okay.

1667
00:57:31,420 --> 00:57:32,449
Get your hands off me.

1668
00:57:33,590 --> 00:57:35,360
- I don't have anything.
- Why won't you show me?

1669
00:57:35,360 --> 00:57:36,460
Why are you doing this to me?

1670
00:57:36,460 --> 00:57:38,559
He put a note in his underwear.

1671
00:57:38,559 --> 00:57:40,300
- Jong Kook.
- So Min, you said you changed.

1672
00:57:40,300 --> 00:57:41,360
This is ridiculous.

1673
00:57:41,730 --> 00:57:43,230
She put her hand in there!

1674
00:57:43,230 --> 00:57:44,369
Where?

1675
00:57:44,369 --> 00:57:46,940
He put a note in his underwear.

1676
00:57:47,099 --> 00:57:49,139
Then you should give up,
not put your hand in there.

1677
00:57:49,139 --> 00:57:50,840
- Don't be like that.
- You should give up.

1678
00:57:50,840 --> 00:57:52,440
Why won't you show me the hint?

1679
00:57:52,440 --> 00:57:54,610
- What is it?
- She touched his butt.

1680
00:57:54,610 --> 00:57:55,610
I didn't do that!

1681
00:57:55,610 --> 00:57:57,610
- She hasn't changed at all!
- That's not true.

1682
00:57:57,610 --> 00:57:59,309
- So Min.
- He hid a note near his butt.

1683
00:57:59,309 --> 00:58:00,719
- So Min.
- For goodness' sake.

1684
00:58:00,719 --> 00:58:03,519
Listen, Jae Seok.
In the shrubs over there,

1685
00:58:03,719 --> 00:58:06,550
he was sitting down.
He came outside like this.

1686
00:58:06,550 --> 00:58:07,559
I asked him about the note.

1687
00:58:07,559 --> 00:58:09,190
Did you poop in the shrubs again?

1688
00:58:09,190 --> 00:58:10,730
- No!
- Did you?

1689
00:58:10,730 --> 00:58:12,630
Why would I poop
when the camera is on me?

1690
00:58:12,630 --> 00:58:14,630
You need to break out of that habit!

1691
00:58:14,630 --> 00:58:16,000
- The toilet is right there.
- Jae Seok.

1692
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:17,969
When I asked him what it was,

1693
00:58:18,469 --> 00:58:20,940
he put it near his butt.

1694
00:58:20,940 --> 00:58:22,769
- He put it in the underwear.
- She kept trying to take it.

1695
00:58:22,769 --> 00:58:25,539
It isn't a good hiding place
since your butt is flat.

1696
00:58:25,539 --> 00:58:27,340
It must have fallen out.
since his butt is flat.

1697
00:58:27,340 --> 00:58:29,239
- Look for it. Look for it.
- Since his butt is flat.

1698
00:58:29,239 --> 00:58:30,849
(Annoyed)

1699
00:58:30,849 --> 00:58:33,619
Look for it. Look for it.
Look for it, okay?

1700
00:58:34,420 --> 00:58:37,789
So Min, So Min. Here is the thing.

1701
00:58:37,920 --> 00:58:40,860
- When you come back from a hiatus,
- That's right.

1702
00:58:40,860 --> 00:58:43,090
- you receive an important role.
- That's right.

1703
00:58:43,090 --> 00:58:44,460
Also, you need to keep this in mind.

1704
00:58:44,530 --> 00:58:47,630
So Min is the one
who invited us here.

1705
00:58:47,630 --> 00:58:49,929
- That's right.
- I don't know anything.

1706
00:58:49,929 --> 00:58:51,599
Isn't So Min acting strange today?

1707
00:58:51,599 --> 00:58:52,730
That could be the case.

1708
00:58:52,730 --> 00:58:55,139
- Why did you bring us here?
- It's like that most of the time.

1709
00:58:55,139 --> 00:58:57,840
So Min, did you come up
with this scheme?

1710
00:58:57,840 --> 00:58:59,039
No, Jae Seok.

1711
00:58:59,039 --> 00:59:01,309
- I am not that smart.
- She sent us the invitation.

1712
00:59:01,510 --> 00:59:04,349
I saw the flyer
and sent you the invitation.

1713
00:59:06,380 --> 00:59:08,219
(Ripping)

1714
00:59:09,050 --> 00:59:10,820
(Se Chan...)

1715
00:59:10,820 --> 00:59:13,449
(ripped off So Min's name tag!)

1716
00:59:14,960 --> 00:59:16,760
(She is back on the show
after a two-month hiatus.)

1717
00:59:16,760 --> 00:59:18,190
Hey!

1718
00:59:18,630 --> 00:59:20,630
Were you determined
to rip off her name tag?

1719
00:59:21,230 --> 00:59:23,460
- Is she out?
- Is she out?

1720
00:59:24,170 --> 00:59:25,300
What does it say?

1721
00:59:25,500 --> 00:59:27,300
(So Min was a victim.)

1722
00:59:27,500 --> 00:59:29,239
Hey, I am back in a long while.

1723
00:59:29,239 --> 00:59:30,869
My goodness.

1724
00:59:30,940 --> 00:59:32,070
I am sorry.

1725
00:59:32,070 --> 00:59:33,840
- I am back in a long while.
- I am sorry.

1726
00:59:33,840 --> 00:59:35,880
I fought with you,
but I didn't do this to you.

1727
00:59:35,880 --> 00:59:37,050
So Min.

1728
00:59:37,050 --> 00:59:38,550
So Min, I didn't do this to you.

1729
00:59:38,550 --> 00:59:40,420
Why didn't you leave So Min be?

1730
00:59:40,420 --> 00:59:42,179
Let me earn some money!

1731
00:59:42,179 --> 00:59:44,219
- I am sorry.
- She is back after a long while.

1732
00:59:44,219 --> 00:59:46,320
- Is So Min out?
- I am out.

1733
00:59:46,349 --> 00:59:48,489
- That startled me so much.
- Hey.

1734
00:59:49,159 --> 00:59:51,829
(Victim)

1735
00:59:52,329 --> 00:59:55,329
Inside the tissue box,

1736
00:59:55,329 --> 00:59:57,269
- I found a note.
- You little...

1737
00:59:57,300 --> 00:59:58,329
(Inside the tissue box,
I found a note.)

1738
00:59:58,329 --> 00:59:59,670
- You little...
- Why didn't you say so earlier?

1739
00:59:59,670 --> 01:00:01,239
How dare you?

1740
01:00:01,239 --> 01:00:02,869
Why didn't you say so earlier?

1741
01:00:02,869 --> 01:00:05,139
You little punk.

1742
01:00:05,139 --> 01:00:06,739
- I won't tell you.
- Come on.

1743
01:00:06,739 --> 01:00:08,579
- I won't tell you for real.
- Please tell us.

1744
01:00:08,579 --> 01:00:10,239
This is a hint
you can't get anymore.

1745
01:00:10,239 --> 01:00:11,980
- All right.
- Please tell us.

1746
01:00:11,980 --> 01:00:14,349
- Share the information with us.
- Don't be annoyed.

1747
01:00:14,349 --> 01:00:16,019
We were simply reacting.

1748
01:00:16,019 --> 01:00:18,219
- Just go with the flow.
- Tell us.

1749
01:00:18,219 --> 01:00:20,119
- Tell us.
- Tell us.

1750
01:00:20,119 --> 01:00:21,860
- There was a phone number.
- What?

1751
01:00:21,860 --> 01:00:23,320
(There was a phone number.)

1752
01:00:24,260 --> 01:00:25,329
And?

1753
01:00:25,559 --> 01:00:26,659
A witness' number.

1754
01:00:26,659 --> 01:00:27,829
What? Did you call the number?

1755
01:00:27,829 --> 01:00:29,659
- Yes. When I called,
- Who picked up?

1756
01:00:29,730 --> 01:00:31,500
a woman picked up.

1757
01:00:31,500 --> 01:00:33,230
(He heard a witness account
over the phone.)

1758
01:00:34,300 --> 01:00:36,739
(The witness visited
Gujeon Village,)

1759
01:00:36,739 --> 01:00:40,880
(and her friend found a gem box.)

1760
01:00:42,840 --> 01:00:45,510
(She heard her friend's scream.)

1761
01:00:45,750 --> 01:00:49,019
(Someone was attacking her friend.)

1762
01:00:49,019 --> 01:00:50,150
That person was...

1763
01:00:50,349 --> 01:00:52,389
very fast and strong.

1764
01:00:52,389 --> 01:00:54,619
(The attacker was
very fast and strong.)

1765
01:00:56,420 --> 01:00:59,090
I think he is setting me up.

1766
01:00:59,090 --> 01:01:00,500
- No, no.
- He could have made this up.

1767
01:01:00,500 --> 01:01:02,199
No, no.
The witness really said that.

1768
01:01:02,199 --> 01:01:06,230
Her friend who got eliminated
didn't let anyone touch the gem box.

1769
01:01:06,230 --> 01:01:07,739
- Her friend who got eliminated?
- Yes.

1770
01:01:08,469 --> 01:01:10,039
Fast and strong?

1771
01:01:10,440 --> 01:01:11,639
Someone who is fast and strong.

1772
01:01:11,639 --> 01:01:12,639
(The truth of Gujeon Village
is shrouded in mystery.)

1773
01:01:14,110 --> 01:01:16,309
Let's scatter and find more hints.

1774
01:01:16,309 --> 01:01:17,380
(They decide to look
for more hints.)

1775
01:01:17,380 --> 01:01:19,110
What on earth is going on?

1776
01:01:20,980 --> 01:01:24,119
(Jae Seok searches for more hints.)

1777
01:01:26,519 --> 01:01:28,820
(What is this place?)

1778
01:01:30,730 --> 01:01:32,429
Gosh, you startled me.

1779
01:01:32,630 --> 01:01:34,130
(The only survivor
among the four sisters,)

1780
01:01:34,130 --> 01:01:35,230
(Kim Sam Nyeo is here.)

1781
01:01:35,230 --> 01:01:36,860
You startled me.

1782
01:01:36,860 --> 01:01:40,639
Mister, please save me.

1783
01:01:40,639 --> 01:01:42,639
- What?
- Please save me.

1784
01:01:42,639 --> 01:01:43,639
What are you doing here alone?

1785
01:01:43,639 --> 01:01:47,239
I was hiding
because I became so scared...

1786
01:01:47,239 --> 01:01:50,449
upon seeing my sisters
get eliminated.

1787
01:01:50,449 --> 01:01:51,510
Who eliminated them?

1788
01:01:51,510 --> 01:01:53,610
You know,

1789
01:01:54,550 --> 01:01:56,980
Jeon Dang Po disappeared.

1790
01:01:56,980 --> 01:01:58,190
Jeon Dang Po disappeared.

1791
01:01:58,190 --> 01:01:59,920
That's right. Jeon Dang Po was
nowhere to be seen.

1792
01:01:59,920 --> 01:02:02,860
Now that Jeon Dang Po disappeared,

1793
01:02:02,860 --> 01:02:05,360
I think that person might come
to me.

1794
01:02:05,360 --> 01:02:06,829
That's why I am hiding.

1795
01:02:06,829 --> 01:02:09,800
This village seems to have a secret.

1796
01:02:09,860 --> 01:02:11,369
Well, I...

1797
01:02:11,369 --> 01:02:13,570
I don't know anything!

1798
01:02:13,570 --> 01:02:14,570
(He attacks Kim Sam Nyeo.)

1799
01:02:14,570 --> 01:02:15,670
- I don't know anything!
- Gosh, hold on.

1800
01:02:15,670 --> 01:02:17,940
What are you doing? I don't know...

1801
01:02:17,940 --> 01:02:19,239
(He ripped off her name tag!)

1802
01:02:19,469 --> 01:02:21,010
I don't know...

1803
01:02:21,010 --> 01:02:24,610
(Is there a hint
on Kim Sam Nyeo's name tag?)

1804
01:02:25,150 --> 01:02:26,480
She's just a victim.

1805
01:02:27,880 --> 01:02:28,980
(Detective Yu killed
an innocent citizen.)

1806
01:02:28,980 --> 01:02:30,849
You killed an innocent citizen.

1807
01:02:31,690 --> 01:02:32,750
Excuse me.

1808
01:02:33,860 --> 01:02:35,019
But...

1809
01:02:35,690 --> 01:02:36,960
(I have more lines.)

1810
01:02:36,960 --> 01:02:38,190
Did you pass away?

1811
01:02:38,190 --> 01:02:39,190
(Jae Seok became speechless.)

1812
01:02:39,190 --> 01:02:40,500
I am sorry.

1813
01:02:41,730 --> 01:02:43,530
Sam Nyeo's name tag
doesn't have a hint.

1814
01:02:43,530 --> 01:02:44,829
(He killed off
innocent Kim Sam Nyeo.)

1815
01:02:45,929 --> 01:02:48,469
For goodness' sake. This is hard.

1816
01:02:48,469 --> 01:02:49,539
(He thinks about
Kim Sam Nyeo's last words.)

1817
01:02:49,539 --> 01:02:51,739
Where did Jeon Dang Po go?

1818
01:02:52,469 --> 01:02:54,179
Today's mission is so hard.

1819
01:02:56,010 --> 01:02:57,579
Today's mission is so hard.

1820
01:02:58,409 --> 01:02:59,849
(He finds Jeon Dang Po!)

1821
01:02:59,849 --> 01:03:01,019
You are here.

1822
01:03:01,349 --> 01:03:02,619
What brings you here?

1823
01:03:02,619 --> 01:03:04,250
- Sir.
- Yes?

1824
01:03:04,519 --> 01:03:08,219
Kim Sam Nyeo said...

1825
01:03:08,320 --> 01:03:10,320
you were acting a bit strange.

1826
01:03:10,320 --> 01:03:13,030
- She said you had disappeared.
- What?

1827
01:03:13,030 --> 01:03:17,730
(Jeon Dang Po was with the sisters,
but he suddenly disappeared.)

1828
01:03:17,730 --> 01:03:20,429
You aren't related
to the village head, are you?

1829
01:03:20,739 --> 01:03:21,940
No, I am not.

1830
01:03:21,940 --> 01:03:23,099
- No?
- No.

1831
01:03:23,599 --> 01:03:25,639
What are you doing?

1832
01:03:25,639 --> 01:03:26,940
(He attacks Jeon Dang Po
this time!)

1833
01:03:27,980 --> 01:03:31,710
Gosh, my head hurts.

1834
01:03:31,710 --> 01:03:32,980
(There is a hint!)

1835
01:03:32,980 --> 01:03:34,219
"It's the darkest under the lamp."

1836
01:03:35,320 --> 01:03:37,619
What does this hint mean?

1837
01:03:37,619 --> 01:03:38,650
(What does this hint mean?)

1838
01:03:40,019 --> 01:03:41,019
(Pawnshop and lamp...)

1839
01:03:41,019 --> 01:03:42,659
"It's the darkest under the lamp"?

1840
01:03:44,460 --> 01:03:45,730
Is there something at the pawnshop?

1841
01:03:48,099 --> 01:03:51,829
(Is there another hint
at the pawnshop?)

1842
01:03:52,900 --> 01:03:55,440
(He looks underneath.)

1843
01:03:56,269 --> 01:03:58,039
(What?)

1844
01:03:58,969 --> 01:03:59,969
What is this?

1845
01:04:01,440 --> 01:04:03,579
(He finds a mysterious cell phone.)

1846
01:04:04,349 --> 01:04:05,510
What is this cell phone?

1847
01:04:07,579 --> 01:04:08,980
Who is "Big Brother"?

1848
01:04:10,079 --> 01:04:12,849
("Big Brother" is the contact
that is saved on the phone.)

1849
01:04:13,989 --> 01:04:17,389
(Jae Seok tries calling
Big Brother.)

1850
01:04:18,130 --> 01:04:19,829
(Someone answers the phone.)

1851
01:04:19,829 --> 01:04:21,000
- Hello.
- Hello.

1852
01:04:21,000 --> 01:04:22,559
- Hello.
- Where are you?

1853
01:04:23,360 --> 01:04:24,530
Who is this?

1854
01:04:24,530 --> 01:04:25,730
This is your little brother.

1855
01:04:26,599 --> 01:04:27,769
Where are you?

1856
01:04:27,769 --> 01:04:29,000
I'm at the pawnshop.

1857
01:04:29,369 --> 01:04:30,500
What?

1858
01:04:31,710 --> 01:04:32,869
Where?

1859
01:04:32,869 --> 01:04:34,139
(The voice sounds familiar.)

1860
01:04:34,139 --> 01:04:35,239
Where are you?

1861
01:04:36,809 --> 01:04:38,050
Isn't this Haha's voice?

1862
01:04:41,219 --> 01:04:42,380
(Big Brother turns out to be Haha.)

1863
01:04:42,380 --> 01:04:43,579
Where are you?

1864
01:04:45,519 --> 01:04:46,690
Where are you?

1865
01:04:46,690 --> 01:04:48,420
(What does Haha have to do
with this village?)

1866
01:04:51,289 --> 01:04:52,460
It's Haha.

1867
01:04:53,159 --> 01:04:54,760
Haha must be hiding something.

1868
01:04:55,400 --> 01:04:58,269
He asked me where I was.
That means there's someone else.

1869
01:05:00,469 --> 01:05:02,570
(Meanwhile, Jong Kook is searching
the rest of the houses.)

1870
01:05:02,570 --> 01:05:04,139
What? There's a picture.

1871
01:05:05,269 --> 01:05:07,409
(There's a picture of two men.)

1872
01:05:08,280 --> 01:05:10,539
(The man on the left is Haha.)

1873
01:05:10,539 --> 01:05:11,650
Haha?

1874
01:05:11,650 --> 01:05:14,449
(Haha's arm is around
a mysterious man.)

1875
01:05:16,150 --> 01:05:17,650
Haha must be hiding something.

1876
01:05:17,650 --> 01:05:19,250
Who is the man next to him,
by the way?

1877
01:05:19,250 --> 01:05:20,349
(Haha is hiding a secret.)

1878
01:05:21,659 --> 01:05:22,960
- Did you find anything?
- Jae Seok.

1879
01:05:23,719 --> 01:05:25,030
- Come here.
- Why?

1880
01:05:25,829 --> 01:05:27,360
I found a picture.

1881
01:05:27,360 --> 01:05:29,030
(A picture of Haha was
among pictures of the villagers.)

1882
01:05:29,030 --> 01:05:30,230
It's Haha.

1883
01:05:31,099 --> 01:05:33,030
- Who is the other man?
- Who is he?

1884
01:05:33,530 --> 01:05:34,940
- Gosh.
- What?

1885
01:05:35,639 --> 01:05:37,940
What is it?

1886
01:05:38,269 --> 01:05:39,739
I found this cell phone.

1887
01:05:39,769 --> 01:05:41,010
You found this?

1888
01:05:41,280 --> 01:05:42,409
What is it?

1889
01:05:42,780 --> 01:05:44,110
- Someone is saved as Big Brother.
- "Big Brother"?

1890
01:05:45,280 --> 01:05:46,579
- So I called this number.
- Okay.

1891
01:05:47,550 --> 01:05:48,780
And Haha answered the phone.

1892
01:05:49,480 --> 01:05:50,690
And Haha answered the phone.

1893
01:05:50,690 --> 01:05:51,989
(All the clues are
pointing to Haha.)

1894
01:05:51,989 --> 01:05:53,150
Who...

1895
01:05:54,090 --> 01:05:55,289
Where are you?

1896
01:05:55,289 --> 01:05:57,690
(He's been keeping a distance from
everyone and eliminated Kwang Ja.)

1897
01:05:57,690 --> 01:05:58,760
It's Haha.

1898
01:05:58,989 --> 01:06:00,190
It's Haha.

1899
01:06:00,329 --> 01:06:01,659
Is this guy his little brother?

1900
01:06:01,659 --> 01:06:02,760
- Is he?
- I don't know.

1901
01:06:02,760 --> 01:06:04,269
(Does Haha live in this village?)

1902
01:06:04,269 --> 01:06:05,500
We should...

1903
01:06:05,500 --> 01:06:07,400
drive him into a corner.

1904
01:06:08,639 --> 01:06:09,869
Mr. Choi!

1905
01:06:09,869 --> 01:06:11,239
(Meanwhile,
at the village head's house...)

1906
01:06:11,239 --> 01:06:13,510
I know you're not sick.

1907
01:06:13,710 --> 01:06:15,440
(Haha is arguing
with the village head.)

1908
01:06:15,440 --> 01:06:17,480
Why are you doing this?

1909
01:06:17,480 --> 01:06:18,579
(Jae Seok and Jong Kook walk in.)

1910
01:06:18,579 --> 01:06:20,309
I have all the evidence.

1911
01:06:20,309 --> 01:06:21,480
(The village head and Haha are
getting into a fight.)

1912
01:06:21,480 --> 01:06:23,050
Stop trying to find out more.

1913
01:06:23,050 --> 01:06:24,820
(Staring)

1914
01:06:26,989 --> 01:06:28,590
Why are you asking me that?

1915
01:06:28,820 --> 01:06:30,690
- Hey.
- It's because you...

1916
01:06:30,690 --> 01:06:32,260
- What's going on?
- The village head...

1917
01:06:32,730 --> 01:06:34,860
Hold on. I'm serious.

1918
01:06:34,860 --> 01:06:36,159
You probably don't trust me, but...

1919
01:06:36,230 --> 01:06:38,130
Please stop him.

1920
01:06:38,130 --> 01:06:41,300
- He just yelled at me.
- He's trying to harm me.

1921
01:06:41,300 --> 01:06:42,639
I mean it.

1922
01:06:42,639 --> 01:06:44,510
He just yelled at me.

1923
01:06:44,869 --> 01:06:46,710
He's always angry.

1924
01:06:46,940 --> 01:06:49,579
- He's always angry.
- Mr. Choi is always angry.

1925
01:06:49,840 --> 01:06:51,449
- Did you answer the phone?
- What?

1926
01:06:51,880 --> 01:06:53,210
(Jae Seok asks Haha about
the person saved as Big Brother.)

1927
01:06:53,210 --> 01:06:54,679
- Did you answer the phone?
- What?

1928
01:06:55,179 --> 01:06:56,750
- Yes, I did.
- Show me your phone.

1929
01:06:56,750 --> 01:06:58,789
- Why is your number saved here?
- Give it to me.

1930
01:06:59,590 --> 01:07:02,260
(They call Big Brother again.)

1931
01:07:02,260 --> 01:07:03,260
(The number is saved as
Little Brother in Haha's phone.)

1932
01:07:03,260 --> 01:07:05,190
Sit down first.
Are you suspecting me?

1933
01:07:05,190 --> 01:07:06,260
Of course.

1934
01:07:06,659 --> 01:07:07,829
(Did Haha eliminate
all the members?)

1935
01:07:07,829 --> 01:07:09,329
- Guys.
- We'll sit down.

1936
01:07:09,699 --> 01:07:10,929
Stand over there.

1937
01:07:11,070 --> 01:07:13,170
I have something unbelievable.

1938
01:07:13,300 --> 01:07:15,269
- I'm serious.
- Show us.

1939
01:07:15,269 --> 01:07:16,570
I'll play it for you.

1940
01:07:17,099 --> 01:07:20,110
(When he is about to be caught,
Haha takes out a voice recorder.)

1941
01:07:20,110 --> 01:07:21,980
- What is it?
- I'll play it for you.

1942
01:07:21,980 --> 01:07:23,940
- The village head...
- Hurry up.

1943
01:07:23,940 --> 01:07:25,980
(Haha plays something
on the recorder.)

1944
01:07:25,980 --> 01:07:27,250
It's you, Dong Sik, right?

1945
01:07:27,250 --> 01:07:29,650
(Village head:
It's you, Dong Sik, right?)

1946
01:07:29,650 --> 01:07:31,190
You stole my keys, didn't you?

1947
01:07:31,750 --> 01:07:33,190
I knew it was you.

1948
01:07:33,320 --> 01:07:35,289
Why did you pretend
to have Alzheimer's?

1949
01:07:35,519 --> 01:07:37,090
Your keys...

1950
01:07:37,389 --> 01:07:38,559
What are they?

1951
01:07:39,329 --> 01:07:41,199
You're going to die soon anyway.

1952
01:07:41,699 --> 01:07:43,000
So give me back my keys.

1953
01:07:44,059 --> 01:07:45,469
Where are they?

1954
01:07:46,170 --> 01:07:48,739
- So what's the cell phone?
- What is it?

1955
01:07:48,769 --> 01:07:49,940
My little brother is called...

1956
01:07:50,239 --> 01:07:51,710
- Dong Sik.
- And?

1957
01:07:51,769 --> 01:07:53,269
He asked me...

1958
01:07:54,139 --> 01:07:55,880
to come to this village
and settle his grudge.

1959
01:07:55,880 --> 01:07:59,579
You heard the village head tell him
he couldn't leave the village alive.

1960
01:07:59,579 --> 01:08:02,050
- That was your brother's voice?
- Yes, that was his voice.

1961
01:08:02,449 --> 01:08:04,150
(Haha's true identity is revealed.)

1962
01:08:04,150 --> 01:08:06,190
Haha, there's a letter for you.

1963
01:08:06,190 --> 01:08:07,250
(A few days ago)

1964
01:08:07,250 --> 01:08:08,519
Please read it out loud.

1965
01:08:08,519 --> 01:08:10,519
(Haha got a letter.)

1966
01:08:10,519 --> 01:08:11,659
What's this?

1967
01:08:16,500 --> 01:08:17,670
"Dear Haha."

1968
01:08:18,130 --> 01:08:19,630
"Is everything all right?"

1969
01:08:19,770 --> 01:08:22,770
"I've been staying in a village
for a month now."

1970
01:08:22,970 --> 01:08:25,909
"Once I'm done learning about
the special diamond here,"

1971
01:08:25,909 --> 01:08:28,039
"I'll write an exclusive news story
about it."

1972
01:08:28,039 --> 01:08:31,250
(Dong Sik, Haha's brother, was
writing about Gujeon Village.)

1973
01:08:31,380 --> 01:08:33,050
"Tomorrow is D-day."

1974
01:08:33,479 --> 01:08:35,680
"I still have to do one last check."

1975
01:08:36,020 --> 01:08:38,050
"But I think I'm getting close..."

1976
01:08:38,149 --> 01:08:42,689
"to the Immortal Heart,
which I've only heard about."

1977
01:08:42,760 --> 01:08:46,189
"But this whole thing is
pretty dangerous."

1978
01:08:46,329 --> 01:08:48,430
"If you stop hearing from me,"

1979
01:08:48,430 --> 01:08:53,130
"you'll receive this letter and
a key by this time next year."

1980
01:08:53,130 --> 01:08:56,270
Did something happen? Did he die?

1981
01:08:56,270 --> 01:08:57,609
(Dong Sik sensed danger
and wrote this letter last year.)

1982
01:08:57,609 --> 01:08:59,539
"Don't trust anyone too fast."

1983
01:08:59,640 --> 01:09:01,310
"Please keep this a secret."

1984
01:09:01,310 --> 01:09:02,409
"I love you, Brother."

1985
01:09:02,409 --> 01:09:05,050
(Giving a key to Haha, Dong Sik
asked him to finish the story.)

1986
01:09:05,380 --> 01:09:08,380
(When Kwang Soo found
the Immortal Heart...)

1987
01:09:08,949 --> 01:09:11,689
(I should try opening it
with my key.)

1988
01:09:12,590 --> 01:09:14,390
(While Kwang Soo was distracted,)

1989
01:09:14,390 --> 01:09:16,689
(Haha tried to open the gem box
but failed.)

1990
01:09:16,689 --> 01:09:17,859
It won't open.

1991
01:09:18,060 --> 01:09:19,159
I can't open it.

1992
01:09:19,829 --> 01:09:22,399
(He tries opening other boxes too.)

1993
01:09:22,399 --> 01:09:23,630
It doesn't fit.

1994
01:09:23,630 --> 01:09:26,199
(He hasn't found a lock
that opens with the key.)

1995
01:09:26,199 --> 01:09:27,739
Are you looking for
your little brother?

1996
01:09:28,340 --> 01:09:31,409
(Beware of those who
try to get in your way.)

1997
01:09:31,409 --> 01:09:33,210
- Did you just try to rip it off?
- "If you find those,"

1998
01:09:33,640 --> 01:09:35,310
"please get rid of them."

1999
01:09:35,579 --> 01:09:38,810
(Haha eliminates Lee Kwang Ja,
who has been hovering around him.)

2000
01:09:39,180 --> 01:09:41,149
(Was Kwang Ja trying to
get in my way or not?)

2001
01:09:41,149 --> 01:09:43,750
(A hint was hidden on the back
of Kwang Ja's name tag.)

2002
01:09:43,819 --> 01:09:45,689
Grapes, stars, trees...

2003
01:09:45,689 --> 01:09:47,760
(Haha examines the bench
that Kwang Ja used to play around.)

2004
01:09:47,920 --> 01:09:48,989
A hill?

2005
01:09:48,989 --> 01:09:50,489
(He finds Kwang Ja's hill.)

2006
01:09:50,489 --> 01:09:52,390
This is just like the lyrics.

2007
01:09:53,130 --> 01:09:54,399
I'm up on the hill now.

2008
01:09:54,399 --> 01:09:56,130
(Following the lyrics, Haha goes up
the hill and looks up at the sky.)

2009
01:09:56,960 --> 01:09:58,069
There are angels.

2010
01:10:00,500 --> 01:10:03,100
(He finds angel figurines
in the tree.)

2011
01:10:03,100 --> 01:10:04,340
It's the password for the safe.

2012
01:10:04,340 --> 01:10:05,439
(Thanks to the angel figurines,
Haha finds the next safe.)

2013
01:10:05,439 --> 01:10:07,210
I found the password
for the safe. Unbelievable.

2014
01:10:08,680 --> 01:10:12,479
(He finds the safe
hidden in the village.)

2015
01:10:14,380 --> 01:10:15,949
(The safe is open.)

2016
01:10:15,949 --> 01:10:17,119
What is this?

2017
01:10:17,720 --> 01:10:18,850
What is this?

2018
01:10:18,850 --> 01:10:22,119
(He finds a voice recorder
and the conversations on it.)

2019
01:10:22,119 --> 01:10:23,460
I knew it was you.

2020
01:10:24,060 --> 01:10:25,260
It was the village head.

2021
01:10:26,359 --> 01:10:28,359
(That's why Haha was
questioning the village head.)

2022
01:10:28,359 --> 01:10:30,859
Are you saying the village head
harmed your brother?

2023
01:10:30,859 --> 01:10:32,569
- Yes.
- Is that what you found out?

2024
01:10:32,569 --> 01:10:33,670
(Haha was an innocent outsider.)

2025
01:10:33,670 --> 01:10:35,699
Does that mean
that the village head has the key?

2026
01:10:35,699 --> 01:10:38,270
No, we have to rip off
his name tag first.

2027
01:10:38,569 --> 01:10:40,869
I think there's a secret
hidden under his name tag.

2028
01:10:40,869 --> 01:10:43,079
- Mr. Choi.
- We have no choice.

2029
01:10:43,109 --> 01:10:44,210
Don't!

2030
01:10:44,579 --> 01:10:45,609
(The village head's name tag
is ripped off immediately.)

2031
01:10:45,609 --> 01:10:46,649
- What is it?
- Right?

2032
01:10:47,949 --> 01:10:49,020
- What is it?
- Right?

2033
01:10:50,649 --> 01:10:53,789
(His name tag was hiding
the password for the safe.)

2034
01:10:54,090 --> 01:10:55,260
- It's the password for the safe.
- It's the password for the safe.

2035
01:10:55,260 --> 01:10:56,659
- Where's the safe?
- It's 940...

2036
01:10:56,659 --> 01:10:58,159
- It's upstairs.
- Let's go upstairs.

2037
01:10:58,329 --> 01:11:00,090
See? I'm innocent. Trust me.

2038
01:11:00,090 --> 01:11:02,399
- I mean it.
- Is it okay to rip off name tags?

2039
01:11:03,029 --> 01:11:04,529
(Kwang Soo and Se Chan
are searching another house.)

2040
01:11:04,529 --> 01:11:06,130
Who eliminated Seok Jin?

2041
01:11:06,130 --> 01:11:07,229
I don't know.

2042
01:11:07,800 --> 01:11:09,770
Hold on. Could it be Jong Kook?

2043
01:11:10,699 --> 01:11:12,539
- What do you think?
- The whole thing?

2044
01:11:13,369 --> 01:11:14,539
Isn't it possible?

2045
01:11:14,539 --> 01:11:16,380
The culprit
is supposed to be strong.

2046
01:11:16,380 --> 01:11:17,779
(According to the witness,
the culprit is strong and fast.)

2047
01:11:17,779 --> 01:11:19,279
- Who could that be?
- You're right.

2048
01:11:20,250 --> 01:11:21,579
It must be Jong Kook.

2049
01:11:21,579 --> 01:11:23,180
(Shocked)

2050
01:11:23,680 --> 01:11:25,050
- Did you memorize the password?
- Start.

2051
01:11:25,449 --> 01:11:27,390
- Yes.
- It's 940302.

2052
01:11:27,390 --> 01:11:29,060
(Without knowing what's going on,
they open the safe.)

2053
01:11:29,689 --> 01:11:30,760
What's this?

2054
01:11:30,760 --> 01:11:32,560
It's another box.

2055
01:11:32,560 --> 01:11:35,229
Are these Russian dolls?

2056
01:11:35,600 --> 01:11:37,560
- Gosh.
- How many are there?

2057
01:11:37,560 --> 01:11:39,199
I'll be honest. I have a key.

2058
01:11:39,399 --> 01:11:41,170
- Why didn't you tell us earlier?
- I mean...

2059
01:11:41,170 --> 01:11:43,340
It's because you didn't trust me.

2060
01:11:43,340 --> 01:11:45,239
- What are you talking about?
- I can't believe you.

2061
01:11:45,239 --> 01:11:46,340
Fine, I'll try opening it.

2062
01:11:46,340 --> 01:11:48,779
I get it. Trust me.

2063
01:11:48,779 --> 01:11:51,409
What is this?
We just need to find the key.

2064
01:11:54,680 --> 01:11:57,279
(They find a piece of paper
in the trash can.)

2065
01:11:57,920 --> 01:11:58,989
What is this?

2066
01:11:59,350 --> 01:12:02,420
"A man mysteriously goes missing
in Gujeon Village..."

2067
01:12:02,989 --> 01:12:06,630
"after finding the most expensive
diamond, Immortal Heart."

2068
01:12:07,289 --> 01:12:09,630
- Hey.
- I'm not supposed to have it?

2069
01:12:09,630 --> 01:12:10,699
I think you're doomed.

2070
01:12:10,859 --> 01:12:11,930
Look at this.

2071
01:12:11,930 --> 01:12:13,029
(Whoever finds the gem box...)

2072
01:12:13,029 --> 01:12:14,329
Someone went missing
after finding it.

2073
01:12:14,939 --> 01:12:16,569
- You found it too.
- Hold on.

2074
01:12:16,800 --> 01:12:18,010
I got goosebumps.

2075
01:12:18,539 --> 01:12:20,409
Whoever finds the gem box...

2076
01:12:20,909 --> 01:12:22,109
You'll disappear too.

2077
01:12:23,310 --> 01:12:24,479
Can you hold this for me?

2078
01:12:25,649 --> 01:12:26,810
- Wait!
- Gosh, you startled me.

2079
01:12:26,810 --> 01:12:27,850
(Just then)

2080
01:12:28,449 --> 01:12:29,979
- There's another picture here.
- Let me see.

2081
01:12:30,979 --> 01:12:32,819
- It's a different picture.
- No, it's the same...

2082
01:12:33,619 --> 01:12:35,989
- Why is she looking that way?
- She's looking the other way.

2083
01:12:36,260 --> 01:12:39,529
(The new picture,
the previous picture)

2084
01:12:39,529 --> 01:12:41,630
(The pictures were taken...)

2085
01:12:41,630 --> 01:12:43,659
(in the yard next to the house.)

2086
01:12:43,659 --> 01:12:44,829
Let's go there.

2087
01:12:44,899 --> 01:12:47,739
(Is there an important hint
hidden in the yard?)

2088
01:12:47,739 --> 01:12:49,399
- Hurry up and open it.
- Open it.

2089
01:12:51,069 --> 01:12:53,539
(The key fits in the lock.)

2090
01:12:54,239 --> 01:12:55,479
- It's open.
- Unbelievable.

2091
01:12:55,880 --> 01:12:56,979
There's something inside.

2092
01:12:57,409 --> 01:12:59,810
Let me see the picture again.

2093
01:12:59,810 --> 01:13:01,220
(Kwang Soo and Se Chan look
around the yard in the picture.)

2094
01:13:01,220 --> 01:13:02,520
This is the place, right?

2095
01:13:05,050 --> 01:13:06,689
- Goodness.
- There's something.

2096
01:13:06,720 --> 01:13:07,960
I can't believe you.

2097
01:13:08,960 --> 01:13:11,189
- You brat.
- You brat.

2098
01:13:13,390 --> 01:13:14,600
Gosh, I have no idea.

2099
01:13:14,600 --> 01:13:15,899
(This yard is supposed to hold
an important clue.)

2100
01:13:16,229 --> 01:13:17,460
What is this?

2101
01:13:18,069 --> 01:13:20,300
- What does it say?
- "To ward off misfortune..."

2102
01:13:20,800 --> 01:13:22,100
"and enjoy prosperity,"

2103
01:13:23,170 --> 01:13:24,640
"honor the scarecrow
as your guardian..."

2104
01:13:24,640 --> 01:13:26,909
(To enjoy prosperity, honor
the scarecrow as your guardian...)

2105
01:13:31,109 --> 01:13:32,579
(The scarecrow grabs
Kwang Soo's name tag.)

2106
01:13:34,720 --> 01:13:36,579
"and offer him a sacrifice
every year."

2107
01:13:36,579 --> 01:13:39,050
(They have to offer the scarecrow
a sacrifice every year?)

2108
01:13:40,789 --> 01:13:42,619
(Kwang Soo is eliminated
immediately.)

2109
01:13:45,729 --> 01:13:47,899
"Whoever touches
the scarecrow's gem box..."

2110
01:13:47,899 --> 01:13:49,260
"will be offered up as a sacrifice."

2111
01:13:49,600 --> 01:13:51,800
"The scarecrow will take away
everyone's name."

2112
01:13:51,800 --> 01:13:54,130
(The secret of Gujeon Village
is finally revealed.)

2113
01:13:54,670 --> 01:13:58,239
(Every May, Gujeon Village attracted
outsiders to their festival.)

2114
01:13:58,239 --> 01:14:01,979
(Blinded by their greed, the Running
Man members attended the festival.)

2115
01:14:02,539 --> 01:14:05,880
(The villagers were
very happy to see the outsiders.)

2116
01:14:06,010 --> 01:14:09,119
(Every year, outsiders have been
lured to the village.)

2117
01:14:10,020 --> 01:14:11,750
(The first one
to find the Immortal Heart...)

2118
01:14:11,750 --> 01:14:14,420
(was Kwang Soo.)

2119
01:14:14,560 --> 01:14:17,890
(That's how the Immortal Heart
got uncovered.)

2120
01:14:19,189 --> 01:14:22,729
(When sacrificial victims
touched the Immortal Heart,)

2121
01:14:22,729 --> 01:14:30,569
(the scarecrow, which they thought
was a mannequin,)

2122
01:14:30,569 --> 01:14:33,510
(started hunting.)

2123
01:14:34,909 --> 01:14:38,779
(Everybody touched the gem box.)

2124
01:14:40,079 --> 01:14:43,220
(Meanwhile, Ji Hyo found
the most decisive lead.)

2125
01:14:44,119 --> 01:14:46,890
(She was looking through
the pictures in the camera.)

2126
01:14:51,829 --> 01:14:54,229
(The scarecrow eliminated her.)

2127
01:14:56,560 --> 01:14:59,229
(The hunter is stronger
than anybody,)

2128
01:14:59,229 --> 01:15:01,970
(and he's lightning fast.)

2129
01:15:03,369 --> 01:15:05,539
(He eliminated Seok Jin after that.)

2130
01:15:06,239 --> 01:15:08,840
(Kim Il Nyeo, E Nyeo, and Sa Nyeo
were eliminated as well.)

2131
01:15:08,840 --> 01:15:10,640
(Any outsider who touched
the Immortal Heart...)

2132
01:15:10,640 --> 01:15:12,979
(gets sacrificed.)

2133
01:15:12,979 --> 01:15:16,279
(Last May, Dong Sik investigated
and found out about everything.)

2134
01:15:16,279 --> 01:15:19,920
(While hiding the Immortal Heart,
he got eliminated by the scarecrow.)

2135
01:15:19,920 --> 01:15:22,390
(The materials he collected...)

2136
01:15:22,390 --> 01:15:26,130
(were locked away by the villagers.)

2137
01:15:26,130 --> 01:15:27,189
(Ha Dong Sik)

2138
01:15:27,189 --> 01:15:30,859
(Each villager kept a secret.)

2139
01:15:32,600 --> 01:15:35,000
(He was the one...)

2140
01:15:35,000 --> 01:15:37,670
(who kept an eye
on the village children.)

2141
01:15:37,670 --> 01:15:41,810
(He's a silent assassin
who was watching the whole village.)

2142
01:15:44,649 --> 01:15:48,180
(Scarecrow)

2143
01:15:50,279 --> 01:15:52,819
(He eliminated Kwang Soo
before he could resist.)

2144
01:15:54,189 --> 01:15:55,789
What was that? Hey!

2145
01:15:55,890 --> 01:15:58,390
(There's only one way to
break the curse of the scarecrow.)

2146
01:15:59,130 --> 01:16:01,229
(You must burn his straw hat.)

2147
01:16:01,930 --> 01:16:05,500
(If you burn his straw hat,
the curse gets broken.)

2148
01:16:06,100 --> 01:16:08,069
Let's burn the straw hat.

2149
01:16:08,069 --> 01:16:12,569
(Burn the scarecrow's hat
in the incinerator.)

2150
01:16:14,010 --> 01:16:15,109
Jae Seok!

2151
01:16:16,079 --> 01:16:17,810
- Jae Seok!
- What?

2152
01:16:18,649 --> 01:16:20,279
- Who?
- Jae Seok.

2153
01:16:20,279 --> 01:16:23,579
In the picture,
it wasn't the scarecrow.

2154
01:16:23,579 --> 01:16:25,050
- It was a person.
- It is.

2155
01:16:25,050 --> 01:16:26,750
(They finally hear about
the identity of the scarecrow.)

2156
01:16:26,949 --> 01:16:28,960
- The scarecrow...
- Wait, let me see the straw hat.

2157
01:16:28,960 --> 01:16:30,890
We have to remove this straw hat.

2158
01:16:30,890 --> 01:16:34,229
(Once they burn this hat,
the scarecrow gets eliminated.)

2159
01:16:34,229 --> 01:16:35,829
Let's go catch him.

2160
01:16:35,829 --> 01:16:37,260
- There are four of us.
- We can do it.

2161
01:16:37,260 --> 01:16:39,670
- He moves so fast.
- Really?

2162
01:16:39,670 --> 01:16:40,670
- Over there...
- He's coming!

2163
01:16:40,670 --> 01:16:42,100
- What?
- He's coming.

2164
01:16:42,770 --> 01:16:43,800
What is it?

2165
01:16:44,710 --> 01:16:46,810
(The scarecrow
starts attacking them.)

2166
01:16:46,970 --> 01:16:48,109
What is it?

2167
01:16:49,109 --> 01:16:50,909
What? What is it?

2168
01:16:51,140 --> 01:16:52,250
Who are you?

2169
01:16:52,250 --> 01:16:53,380
(Scarecrow versus Jong Kook)

2170
01:16:53,609 --> 01:16:54,680
Hold on.

2171
01:16:54,680 --> 01:16:56,680
(He comes up fast
and attacks Jong Kook.)

2172
01:16:56,819 --> 01:16:57,920
What was that?

2173
01:16:57,920 --> 01:16:59,520
(Jong Kook is out.)

2174
01:17:00,050 --> 01:17:01,560
What was that? Who are you?

2175
01:17:01,560 --> 01:17:03,789
(Why is he so strong?)

2176
01:17:04,220 --> 01:17:06,159
- He's so strong!
- My gosh.

2177
01:17:06,729 --> 01:17:08,430
- What was that?
- What was that?

2178
01:17:08,960 --> 01:17:10,229
What was that?

2179
01:17:10,229 --> 01:17:11,970
What was that? My gosh.

2180
01:17:12,069 --> 01:17:13,500
- What was that?
- Jae Seok!

2181
01:17:13,630 --> 01:17:14,970
Shouldn't we help him?

2182
01:17:15,770 --> 01:17:16,899
What was that?

2183
01:17:16,899 --> 01:17:18,010
(He starts hunting the other members
before the cameras catch up.)

2184
01:17:18,470 --> 01:17:19,640
What was that?

2185
01:17:21,210 --> 01:17:22,539
I'm so scared.

2186
01:17:23,140 --> 01:17:24,609
- What was that?
- I'm scared.

2187
01:17:26,680 --> 01:17:28,619
(The scarecrow caught up
with Se Chan who was running away.)

2188
01:17:28,619 --> 01:17:30,880
I'm scared. Wait.

2189
01:17:30,880 --> 01:17:31,949
I'm scared.

2190
01:17:33,289 --> 01:17:34,449
I'm scared!

2191
01:17:34,489 --> 01:17:36,390
That was so scary!

2192
01:17:37,390 --> 01:17:40,130
(Jae Seok and Haha are
the only members left.)

2193
01:17:41,229 --> 01:17:44,029
(The scarecrow is strong and fast.)

2194
01:17:45,430 --> 01:17:46,770
Jae Seok, we have to work together.

2195
01:17:48,000 --> 01:17:49,100
Who is this person?

2196
01:17:49,100 --> 01:17:50,800
- See? He's out already.
- Okay.

2197
01:17:50,800 --> 01:17:52,739
Let's go.

2198
01:17:52,970 --> 01:17:55,409
Together. We can do it together.

2199
01:17:55,779 --> 01:17:57,409
- Is he out?
- Where did he go?

2200
01:17:57,409 --> 01:17:59,079
(The scarecrow disappeared
in an instant.)

2201
01:17:59,079 --> 01:18:00,210
Where did he go?

2202
01:18:00,510 --> 01:18:01,779
Don't run away.

2203
01:18:03,819 --> 01:18:05,489
He's over there.
Jae Seok, he's there.

2204
01:18:06,020 --> 01:18:07,489
(Scarecrow versus Jae Seok and Haha)

2205
01:18:07,489 --> 01:18:08,819
- Let's do it together.
- From above.

2206
01:18:08,920 --> 01:18:10,260
From above.

2207
01:18:10,859 --> 01:18:12,229
From above.

2208
01:18:12,890 --> 01:18:16,130
(They fight 2 to 1,
but the scarecrow defends himself.)

2209
01:18:17,899 --> 01:18:19,470
- He's so fast.
- Why is he so fast?

2210
01:18:19,470 --> 01:18:20,529
(He's driving them crazy.)

2211
01:18:20,529 --> 01:18:22,800
(Haha grabbed the straw hat!)

2212
01:18:22,800 --> 01:18:23,869
- Good job.
- What was that?

2213
01:18:23,869 --> 01:18:24,909
(But he only ripped some straws.)

2214
01:18:24,909 --> 01:18:25,909
What was that?

2215
01:18:25,909 --> 01:18:27,640
(This is a volatile situation.)

2216
01:18:28,479 --> 01:18:29,539
Who is this person?

2217
01:18:29,539 --> 01:18:30,539
Come here!

2218
01:18:32,750 --> 01:18:34,710
(Will the scarecrow rip their name
tags or will they steal his hat?)

2219
01:18:34,710 --> 01:18:36,180
Hey, hey.

2220
01:18:42,359 --> 01:18:45,329
(He stole the straw hat.)

2221
01:18:46,159 --> 01:18:47,229
Burn it.

2222
01:18:47,229 --> 01:18:50,000
(Haha narrowly stole the hat.)

2223
01:18:50,000 --> 01:18:52,500
(He sprints to the incinerator.)

2224
01:18:52,699 --> 01:18:55,500
(The scarecrow can't see well
because of the mask.)

2225
01:18:57,039 --> 01:18:59,439
(If he manages to burn the hat,
both members win!)

2226
01:19:00,840 --> 01:19:01,840
This is hot.

2227
01:19:01,840 --> 01:19:04,010
(He put the straw hat in the fire.)

2228
01:19:06,649 --> 01:19:08,880
(The curse has been broken.)

2229
01:19:09,979 --> 01:19:15,220
(Gujeon Village doesn't need to make
sacrifices anymore.)

2230
01:19:16,819 --> 01:19:21,960
(They also obtained the key to the
Immortal Heart that was in the hat.)

2231
01:19:22,600 --> 01:19:27,470
Everybody, today's race was
the Secret of Gujeon Village.

2232
01:19:27,699 --> 01:19:31,840
This village was protected by
the Almighty of the scarecrow.

2233
01:19:31,840 --> 01:19:34,939
- And then?
- Outsiders who touch the gem box...

2234
01:19:35,079 --> 01:19:38,479
all get sacrificed
and get eliminated by the scarecrow.

2235
01:19:38,479 --> 01:19:40,449
- I touched it.
- The gem box.

2236
01:19:40,449 --> 01:19:42,520
People who touched it
got eliminated.

2237
01:19:42,649 --> 01:19:45,020
You were all probably wondering
who the scarecrow was.

2238
01:19:45,020 --> 01:19:46,020
Who was it?

2239
01:19:46,020 --> 01:19:47,949
- Let's invite him here first.
- Okay.

2240
01:19:47,949 --> 01:19:50,220
- Scarecrow, come on out.
- He scared me to death.

2241
01:19:50,220 --> 01:19:51,930
- He was no joke.
- Really?

2242
01:19:51,930 --> 01:19:53,930
- He was so fast.
- He's so fast.

2243
01:19:53,930 --> 01:19:56,060
- He was great in ripping name tags.
- He's scary.

2244
01:19:56,199 --> 01:19:57,260
Who is it?

2245
01:19:57,260 --> 01:19:59,600
You were all probably wondering
who the scarecrow was.

2246
01:19:59,600 --> 01:20:01,470
(Jong Kook was surprised at his
strength and speed. He is...)

2247
01:20:01,470 --> 01:20:02,470
He...

2248
01:20:03,239 --> 01:20:06,069
owns a channel. It's Kim Gye Ran
of Physical Gallery.

2249
01:20:06,069 --> 01:20:07,510
It's Kim Gye Ran?

2250
01:20:07,640 --> 01:20:09,180
- Nice to meet you.
- Hello.

2251
01:20:09,180 --> 01:20:10,539
- Wow, friends.
- I watch his videos a lot.

2252
01:20:10,539 --> 01:20:13,310
- I'm the bald man.
- The bald man.

2253
01:20:14,109 --> 01:20:16,680
(He's extremely athletic as a former
member of the UDT.)

2254
01:20:17,079 --> 01:20:20,520
(He has a muscular physique
and is stronger than most people.)

2255
01:20:21,590 --> 01:20:23,420
(Kim Gye Ran)

2256
01:20:23,420 --> 01:20:24,890
I'm the bald man.

2257
01:20:24,890 --> 01:20:26,689
- The bald man.
- Hello.

2258
01:20:26,689 --> 01:20:28,060
Jong Kook.

2259
01:20:28,060 --> 01:20:29,130
(The workout masters meet.)

2260
01:20:29,130 --> 01:20:30,460
- I wanted to meet you the most.
- The bald man!

2261
01:20:31,029 --> 01:20:33,630
- I wanted to meet him the most.
- Really?

2262
01:20:33,829 --> 01:20:35,399
I really like him.

2263
01:20:35,399 --> 01:20:38,340
Jong Kook was never this happy
with any other guest.

2264
01:20:38,340 --> 01:20:39,909
- He's so excited.
- He's so happy.

2265
01:20:39,909 --> 01:20:41,939
- I love him.
- Okay!

2266
01:20:41,939 --> 01:20:43,310
I really like him.

2267
01:20:43,840 --> 01:20:46,510
I trust his workout channel
the most.

2268
01:20:46,649 --> 01:20:48,279
- I know.
- Kim Gye Ran?

2269
01:20:48,920 --> 01:20:49,979
I watch your videos too.

2270
01:20:49,979 --> 01:20:53,350
Haha managed to burn his straw hat.

2271
01:20:54,119 --> 01:20:55,489
- You stole it from me.
- Narrowly.

2272
01:20:55,489 --> 01:20:57,819
The scarecrow got eliminated,
and here's the gem box.

2273
01:20:57,819 --> 01:20:59,560
(Winner Haha gets the real gem box.)

2274
01:20:59,560 --> 01:21:00,930
Don't you die if you touch that?

2275
01:21:00,930 --> 01:21:02,659
No, I broke the curse.

2276
01:21:03,699 --> 01:21:05,630
(The prize gets revealed.)

2277
01:21:05,630 --> 01:21:07,130
What is it?

2278
01:21:07,130 --> 01:21:08,840
- Goodness.
- It's the Immortal Heart.

2279
01:21:09,439 --> 01:21:10,500
It's the Immortal Heart.

2280
01:21:10,500 --> 01:21:12,569
This is useless to bring it home.

2281
01:21:12,569 --> 01:21:14,340
- Does he have to take that?
- Your kids will like it.

2282
01:21:15,239 --> 01:21:16,380
You'll get eight dollars from it.

2283
01:21:16,380 --> 01:21:18,909
That's the gem of this village,
the Immortal Heart.

2284
01:21:19,750 --> 01:21:20,979
That's the Immortal Heart?

2285
01:21:20,979 --> 01:21:22,449
That's the Immortal Heart?

2286
01:21:22,449 --> 01:21:24,479
- This is insane. I'm envious.
- That's amazing.

2287
01:21:24,479 --> 01:21:26,220
(You can't list a prize for
the Immortal Heart.)

2288
01:21:26,220 --> 01:21:27,449
This is amazing.

2289
01:21:28,189 --> 01:21:29,890
I'm envious!

2290
01:21:30,319 --> 01:21:32,489
We usually give the prize
to the guest.

2291
01:21:32,489 --> 01:21:33,590
It's fine.

2292
01:21:33,760 --> 01:21:36,000
- Haha, you can't do that.
- Gye Ran.

2293
01:21:36,460 --> 01:21:38,060
- That's unnecessary.
- Take it home.

2294
01:21:38,060 --> 01:21:39,399
Since you're on Running Man.

2295
01:21:39,399 --> 01:21:41,600
Can I just take a picture with you?

2296
01:21:41,600 --> 01:21:44,170
- Just a picture.
- We'll take a picture.

2297
01:21:44,300 --> 01:21:46,039
- Great work.
- Thank you.

2298
01:21:46,039 --> 01:21:47,510
Great work.

2299
01:21:48,439 --> 01:21:50,609
(TWICE is back as a whole group.)

2300
01:21:51,340 --> 01:21:53,680
(Return of the popular group, TWICE)

2301
01:21:54,510 --> 01:21:57,649
(It's TWICE.)

2302
01:21:58,819 --> 01:22:01,390
(Check out their unexpected charms!)

2303
01:22:01,760 --> 01:22:03,560
(They rip name tags
without hesitation...)

2304
01:22:03,560 --> 01:22:05,189
(and can do slapstick comedy.)

2305
01:22:05,630 --> 01:22:07,659
(She is a bigger traitor
than Kwang Soo.)

2306
01:22:07,659 --> 01:22:09,399
(Is she the new traitor?)

2307
01:22:09,729 --> 01:22:10,899
(They're tempted...)

2308
01:22:10,899 --> 01:22:13,600
(by the captain role.)

2309
01:22:14,199 --> 01:22:15,600
(Once you become the captain,)

2310
01:22:15,600 --> 01:22:17,000
(you can lead the team
however you want.)

2311
01:22:17,199 --> 01:22:20,439
(Form alliances and betray them
to throw off your teammates.)

2312
01:22:21,439 --> 01:22:23,279
(Build solid trust...)

2313
01:22:23,279 --> 01:22:25,279
(and find your guarantor!)

2314
01:22:25,649 --> 01:22:28,180
(A war ensues to obtain
the captain's privilege!)

2315
01:22:28,779 --> 01:22:30,720
(Captains of Running Man)
