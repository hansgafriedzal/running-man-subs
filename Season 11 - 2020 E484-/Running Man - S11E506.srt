1
00:00:05,790 --> 00:00:07,680
- Hello.
- Hello.

2
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:08,680
Hey.

3
00:00:08,680 --> 00:00:10,760
- Hello.
- This is pretty.

4
00:00:10,760 --> 00:00:12,590
- This place looks like a cafe.
- Hello.

5
00:00:12,590 --> 00:00:14,430
It also looks like an escape room.

6
00:00:14,430 --> 00:00:16,350
- This is pretty.
- Look at that.

7
00:00:16,350 --> 00:00:17,620
This is so nice.

8
00:00:17,620 --> 00:00:19,590
We have a flasher here.

9
00:00:20,230 --> 00:00:21,800
Shouldn't it be X-rated?

10
00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:23,260
- What?
- He looks like a flasher.

11
00:00:23,260 --> 00:00:24,840
Hey, listen.

12
00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:28,230
Kwang Soo, do you have
a problem with your stylist?

13
00:00:28,230 --> 00:00:29,230
Why? It's my style.

14
00:00:29,230 --> 00:00:31,410
- Are you wearing underpants?
- Aren't they too short?

15
00:00:31,530 --> 00:00:34,210
- No.
- Which one are your pants?

16
00:00:34,210 --> 00:00:36,320
- He tries so hard.
- Seriously.

17
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:37,570
You're so gutty.

18
00:00:37,570 --> 00:00:38,780
What did you say?

19
00:00:39,450 --> 00:00:40,710
He told me earlier...

20
00:00:40,710 --> 00:00:43,750
that this is what a celebrity should
wear. But with the camera on,

21
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:45,750
- he says "You're so gutty."
- He woke up.

22
00:00:45,850 --> 00:00:48,030
Isn't that what
Sherlock Holmes wears?

23
00:00:48,030 --> 00:00:49,460
- The checked jacket.
- It's similar.

24
00:00:49,460 --> 00:00:51,290
- You need a hat though.
- His pants are too short.

25
00:00:51,290 --> 00:00:52,290
You look better without the jacket.

26
00:00:52,290 --> 00:00:53,700
- Right. This is much better.
- I like that.

27
00:00:53,700 --> 00:00:55,330
You look more
sophisticated this way.

28
00:00:55,330 --> 00:00:56,640
You look better
without the jacket on.

29
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:57,890
My goodness.

30
00:00:57,890 --> 00:00:59,830
I'll just wear a white shirt
and jeans next week.

31
00:01:00,710 --> 00:01:01,740
- I know.
- This is a lot better.

32
00:01:01,740 --> 00:01:03,280
That's how you end up.

33
00:01:03,430 --> 00:01:06,450
Today, we have
special guests waiting.

34
00:01:06,450 --> 00:01:07,450
- Wow.
- I see.

35
00:01:07,450 --> 00:01:09,470
Let's bring in the guests then.

36
00:01:09,580 --> 00:01:11,270
- Who are they?
- I guess there are a lot.

37
00:01:11,270 --> 00:01:13,020
- I just hope...
- What?

38
00:01:13,020 --> 00:01:14,050
Hey.

39
00:01:15,140 --> 00:01:17,460
- My goodness.
- They all are here.

40
00:01:17,460 --> 00:01:19,660
(Who are the special guests
that surprised everyone?)

41
00:01:20,220 --> 00:01:22,100
(More and more diverse charms)

42
00:01:22,100 --> 00:01:23,990
(TWICE full of charms)

43
00:01:24,050 --> 00:01:26,190
- What's going on?
- They all are here.

44
00:01:26,300 --> 00:01:28,300
- What are you guys doing here?
- I can't believe this.

45
00:01:28,300 --> 00:01:29,440
This is amazing.

46
00:01:29,440 --> 00:01:31,160
- Hello, guys.
- My goodness.

47
00:01:31,160 --> 00:01:32,470
- This way.
- They all are here.

48
00:01:32,470 --> 00:01:35,330
- When did you come?
- Hello.

49
00:01:35,330 --> 00:01:38,850
(TWICE performs their new song
as soon as they show up.)

50
00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:43,020
("More and More" by TWICE)

51
00:01:44,550 --> 00:01:45,610
This is crazy.

52
00:01:45,690 --> 00:01:47,020
Let's go!

53
00:01:47,720 --> 00:01:49,660
They've become even prettier.

54
00:01:49,750 --> 00:01:51,220
There weren't any articles
about them.

55
00:01:51,220 --> 00:01:52,960
- I know.
- Move over!

56
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:53,960
- It was a secret.
- Move over!

57
00:01:53,960 --> 00:01:54,960
Back off.

58
00:01:56,020 --> 00:01:58,330
- This is amazing.
- They've become even prettier.

59
00:01:58,770 --> 00:02:01,800
(So one more time)

60
00:02:04,270 --> 00:02:05,440
My gosh.

61
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:07,240
TWICE! TWICE!

62
00:02:07,240 --> 00:02:09,210
- They dance so well.
- They are amazing.

63
00:02:09,210 --> 00:02:10,500
I love them.

64
00:02:12,110 --> 00:02:13,110
(Addictive beats)

65
00:02:13,110 --> 00:02:14,450
They are so cool.

66
00:02:14,450 --> 00:02:16,310
(Everyone's addicted to the song.)

67
00:02:17,580 --> 00:02:19,110
They all are great dancers.

68
00:02:19,110 --> 00:02:20,840
They are really good.

69
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:24,710
(TWICE's fresh performance makes
people want to watch it again.)

70
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:28,330
(Truly impressed)

71
00:02:28,330 --> 00:02:30,120
That was great.

72
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:31,300
- What's going on?
- I'm really surprised.

73
00:02:31,300 --> 00:02:33,090
I had no idea.

74
00:02:33,090 --> 00:02:34,930
- Me neither.
- How did you come?

75
00:02:34,930 --> 00:02:37,990
When TWICE comes,
they usually release articles first.

76
00:02:37,990 --> 00:02:40,460
- I know.
- Please say hello first.

77
00:02:40,460 --> 00:02:41,930
Okay.

78
00:02:41,930 --> 00:02:43,270
It's been a long time.

79
00:02:43,270 --> 00:02:44,900
- 1, 2, and 3.
- One in a million.

80
00:02:44,900 --> 00:02:47,550
- Hello, we are TWICE.
- Hello, we are TWICE.

81
00:02:48,580 --> 00:02:49,680
It's TWICE!

82
00:02:49,740 --> 00:02:50,920
Today's going to be fun.

83
00:02:50,950 --> 00:02:52,550
I'm very thankful...

84
00:02:52,550 --> 00:02:54,740
that they visit our show
like this every time.

85
00:02:54,740 --> 00:02:57,650
First of all... Hang on.

86
00:02:57,650 --> 00:03:00,020
Ji Hyo and So Min are
being too quiet now.

87
00:03:00,020 --> 00:03:01,330
Why are you so deflated?

88
00:03:01,330 --> 00:03:03,430
- So Min, you're dressed like TWICE.
- You look like them.

89
00:03:03,430 --> 00:03:04,620
- Look at the color.
- Stand next to Tzuyu.

90
00:03:04,620 --> 00:03:06,230
- Stand here.
- Go ahead and do it.

91
00:03:06,620 --> 00:03:09,200
You look like their manager.

92
00:03:09,700 --> 00:03:11,640
- I know.
- That's true.

93
00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:13,800
- Look at her.
- So Min.

94
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:15,430
Ji Hyo, stand next to them.

95
00:03:15,430 --> 00:03:16,930
- You're wearing similar colors.
- I'm their road manager.

96
00:03:16,930 --> 00:03:18,110
She's a road manager.

97
00:03:18,110 --> 00:03:19,740
- I'm their road manager.
- Right.

98
00:03:19,740 --> 00:03:21,740
- TWICE is our guests for today.
- It's a TWICE special.

99
00:03:21,740 --> 00:03:23,450
I'm really glad to see them.

100
00:03:23,450 --> 00:03:26,640
The nine members
of TWICE are back...

101
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:29,310
on Running Man after two years.

102
00:03:29,310 --> 00:03:30,960
I wish I knew about it.

103
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:32,550
Right. We would've
gotten ready for this.

104
00:03:32,550 --> 00:03:33,860
We would've worn outfits
that match theirs.

105
00:03:33,860 --> 00:03:34,860
What would you do
if you knew about it?

106
00:03:34,860 --> 00:03:37,520
If I knew, I would've
dressed like a hippie.

107
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:39,230
- I would've worn...
- I would've worn matching ones.

108
00:03:39,230 --> 00:03:40,830
- Kwang Soo is like a hippie.
- All right then.

109
00:03:40,830 --> 00:03:43,330
Please say hello
to our viewers one by one.

110
00:03:43,330 --> 00:03:45,540
Hello. I'm Tzuyu of TWICE.

111
00:03:45,540 --> 00:03:46,670
Tzuyu.

112
00:03:46,900 --> 00:03:48,900
She's Tzuyu. Tzuyu is...

113
00:03:48,900 --> 00:03:50,740
I remember something
about Tzuyu. Thanks to her...

114
00:03:50,740 --> 00:03:52,040
Stay quiet.

115
00:03:52,040 --> 00:03:53,640
This is an interesting story!

116
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:55,640
This is really funny,
but I'm not going to tell you.

117
00:03:55,640 --> 00:03:56,840
That's enough.

118
00:03:56,840 --> 00:03:58,340
- This is hilarious.
- This situation is funny.

119
00:03:58,340 --> 00:04:00,580
- I'll hear it in the waiting room.
- We want to hear TWICE's voice.

120
00:04:00,580 --> 00:04:02,960
- I don't want to hear your voice.
- He's right!

121
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:04,810
Do you not want
my funny story? Okay.

122
00:04:05,150 --> 00:04:06,490
I guess it's a funny story.

123
00:04:06,490 --> 00:04:07,830
Tell us about it.

124
00:04:07,830 --> 00:04:09,520
It can't be fun this way!

125
00:04:09,830 --> 00:04:11,230
Don't say it then.

126
00:04:11,230 --> 00:04:13,890
If it's a funny story,
it will still sound funny this way.

127
00:04:13,890 --> 00:04:16,990
We need to hear TWICE's voice.
I don't want you to cut in.

128
00:04:16,990 --> 00:04:18,640
- I'm sorry.
- It was my mistake.

129
00:04:18,640 --> 00:04:20,670
Stay focused.

130
00:04:20,670 --> 00:04:23,480
- Okay.
- Please say hello.

131
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:26,240
Hello. I'm Sana of TWICE.

132
00:04:26,650 --> 00:04:28,370
- All right.
- Sana.

133
00:04:28,370 --> 00:04:29,940
Sana for today and tomorrow.

134
00:04:29,940 --> 00:04:31,920
Don't make silly jokes
like "shy shy shy".

135
00:04:32,010 --> 00:04:33,850
- It's old-fashioned.
- What's "shy shy shy"?

136
00:04:33,850 --> 00:04:35,550
- Do you not know it?
- I don't know.

137
00:04:35,660 --> 00:04:37,160
He means "shy shy shy".

138
00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:38,750
- "Shy shy shy".
- He sounded like "Sa sa sa".

139
00:04:38,750 --> 00:04:40,860
The word is "shy".

140
00:04:40,860 --> 00:04:43,120
I'm sorry, but we seem
a little nervous now.

141
00:04:43,620 --> 00:04:44,730
Don't be nervous.

142
00:04:44,730 --> 00:04:46,060
It's okay. We all are friends.

143
00:04:46,060 --> 00:04:47,300
Relax. It's okay.

144
00:04:47,300 --> 00:04:49,060
- We are celebrities too.
- Don't feel nervous.

145
00:04:49,060 --> 00:04:50,740
- Just relax.
- It's all right.

146
00:04:50,740 --> 00:04:52,300
Don't be nervous. Relax.

147
00:04:52,300 --> 00:04:54,630
- We are celebrities too.
- 1, 2, and 3.

148
00:04:54,630 --> 00:04:56,700
- Let's do this.
- We need to show them.

149
00:04:56,700 --> 00:04:58,300
- Relax.
- It's all right.

150
00:04:58,300 --> 00:04:59,550
- Hey, act natural.
- We are celebrities.

151
00:04:59,550 --> 00:05:01,180
- Act natural.
- Okay.

152
00:05:01,180 --> 00:05:03,010
- Hey, relax.
- About Sana.

153
00:05:03,010 --> 00:05:05,480
Whatever Sana sings
becomes the highlight.

154
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:07,740
It's like "shy shy shy".

155
00:05:07,740 --> 00:05:09,490
It's actually nothing special.

156
00:05:09,490 --> 00:05:10,860
It could've been something normal.

157
00:05:10,860 --> 00:05:12,550
But it sounds special
when Sana sings it.

158
00:05:12,550 --> 00:05:14,750
It wouldn't have been special
if she just said shy shy shy.

159
00:05:14,750 --> 00:05:16,360
How did you do it? Can you show us?

160
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:17,620
I don't remember.

161
00:05:18,430 --> 00:05:21,620
(I was seeing my friends,
so I was shy shy shy)

162
00:05:21,620 --> 00:05:22,970
- This is it.
- My gosh.

163
00:05:22,990 --> 00:05:24,540
This is what we call a highlight.

164
00:05:24,540 --> 00:05:26,000
I think So Min can do this.

165
00:05:26,130 --> 00:05:27,910
- Try it.
- "I was seeing my friends".

166
00:05:27,970 --> 00:05:30,630
(I was seeing my friends,
so I was shy shy shy)

167
00:05:33,150 --> 00:05:34,180
Oh, dear.

168
00:05:34,180 --> 00:05:35,180
(Groaning)

169
00:05:35,550 --> 00:05:37,280
- That's not it.
- <i>Shy shy shy</i>

170
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:39,090
- Ji Hyo, give it a try.
- Ji Hyo.

171
00:05:39,090 --> 00:05:40,350
- Shy shy shy?
- Yes.

172
00:05:41,110 --> 00:05:42,660
(Excited)

173
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:44,810
(I was seeing my friends,
so I was shy shy shy)

174
00:05:44,810 --> 00:05:46,360
(Slurring the end of her song)

175
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:49,950
(He can't control
the look on his face.)

176
00:05:50,530 --> 00:05:52,560
- She's got her own vibes.
- Right.

177
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:54,100
It shows how experienced she is.

178
00:05:54,100 --> 00:05:55,320
- She seems experienced.
- Hey.

179
00:05:55,320 --> 00:05:57,190
I'm just afraid her makeup
would get on my jacket.

180
00:05:57,190 --> 00:05:58,970
My goodness.

181
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,500
I can do it in a sexy way.

182
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:03,000
(I was seeing my friends,
so I was shy shy shy)

183
00:06:03,410 --> 00:06:05,130
(They don't know how to react.)

184
00:06:05,130 --> 00:06:07,480
Okay. So Min is trying hard.

185
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:09,980
- There you go, So Min.
- Well done.

186
00:06:10,150 --> 00:06:11,510
It's not good, but I appreciate it.

187
00:06:11,550 --> 00:06:13,850
I think you all are
in good condition today.

188
00:06:13,850 --> 00:06:15,660
But don't do anything
that I didn't ask for.

189
00:06:15,660 --> 00:06:17,860
- At least during the opening. Okay?
- You need to control yourself.

190
00:06:17,860 --> 00:06:21,120
So Sana just showed us
her part for "shy shy shy".

191
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:22,750
Then why don't you sing
one of Turbo's songs?

192
00:06:22,750 --> 00:06:23,950
What? Jae Suk.

193
00:06:23,950 --> 00:06:25,250
- "Goodbye Yesterday" by Turbo.
- All of a sudden?

194
00:06:25,250 --> 00:06:26,930
- "Goodbye Yesterday".
- Let them sing it.

195
00:06:26,930 --> 00:06:28,560
- Let them sing "Black Cat" instead.
- <i>Maybe I loved you</i>

196
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:30,040
That would be better.

197
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:32,610
- Show us the original dance moves.
- <i>Black cat Nero</i>

198
00:06:32,670 --> 00:06:34,200
- It goes like this, right?
- Start.

199
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:36,540
Who dances like that?

200
00:06:36,540 --> 00:06:38,040
Who are you talking about?

201
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:40,440
- What was that?
- This isn't just right.

202
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:42,980
- What is it then?
- <i>Black cat Nero</i>

203
00:06:43,010 --> 00:06:45,050
(The point is catchy moves
that anyone can easily follow.)

204
00:06:45,050 --> 00:06:46,440
- This is it.
- All right.

205
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:47,990
<i>This cute friend of mine</i>

206
00:06:48,310 --> 00:06:49,490
<i>It is a black cat</i>

207
00:06:49,490 --> 00:06:50,810
This is it.

208
00:06:50,810 --> 00:06:53,730
Please try it
with your own feelings for us.

209
00:06:53,730 --> 00:06:55,450
She'll be cute.

210
00:06:55,450 --> 00:06:56,490
Start.

211
00:06:57,050 --> 00:06:58,620
(Cute)

212
00:06:58,620 --> 00:07:00,060
- She's so cute.
- She's lovely.

213
00:07:00,060 --> 00:07:01,930
(Black cat Nero)

214
00:07:01,930 --> 00:07:05,630
(My friend is a cat.)

215
00:07:07,700 --> 00:07:09,540
- "My friend is a cat."
- "My friend is a cat."

216
00:07:09,540 --> 00:07:10,910
My mom is a cat too.

217
00:07:10,910 --> 00:07:14,910
Next up is Chaeyoung.
Let me ask her a question.

218
00:07:14,910 --> 00:07:18,550
Fans say she can do
an impression of Lim Kim.

219
00:07:18,550 --> 00:07:20,290
- Please show us.
- That sounds nice.

220
00:07:20,290 --> 00:07:22,220
Please do an impression of Lim Kim.

221
00:07:22,450 --> 00:07:23,920
This is quite old though.

222
00:07:26,530 --> 00:07:29,160
(I'm all right these days)

223
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:31,820
(What?)

224
00:07:31,820 --> 00:07:33,990
- It's really old.
- It is.

225
00:07:34,820 --> 00:07:36,190
("All Right" by Lim Kim
was released in 2013.)

226
00:07:36,190 --> 00:07:38,100
- It is.
- It was about 10 years ago.

227
00:07:38,260 --> 00:07:39,930
- It was from "Superstar K".
- I thought of something else.

228
00:07:39,930 --> 00:07:41,130
Isn't it about 10 years old?

229
00:07:41,130 --> 00:07:42,410
She prepared something new.

230
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:43,800
- She does?
- Yes.

231
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:45,630
We just got a report. What is it?

232
00:07:46,350 --> 00:07:48,070
It's from "A World
of Married Couple".

233
00:07:48,070 --> 00:07:49,310
- That's a good one.
- Nice.

234
00:07:49,310 --> 00:07:51,010
- It's new.
- It's popular.

235
00:07:51,010 --> 00:07:52,810
I can imitate
the facial expressions.

236
00:07:52,810 --> 00:07:54,440
- Who can you imitate?
- Yeo Da Kyung.

237
00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:56,010
- Yeo Da Kyung?
- It's Yeo Da Kyung. Nice.

238
00:07:56,010 --> 00:07:57,750
- This is when she's upset.
- Okay.

239
00:07:57,950 --> 00:07:59,180
Her hair is like this.

240
00:07:59,180 --> 00:08:00,820
- Exactly.
- Right. She looks like that.

241
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:05,320
- Exactly.
- That's it.

242
00:08:05,320 --> 00:08:06,430
She has the look.

243
00:08:07,060 --> 00:08:08,730
Half of her face looks the same.

244
00:08:08,730 --> 00:08:09,740
She has the look.

245
00:08:10,490 --> 00:08:11,760
- I know what it is.
- She looks exactly like her.

246
00:08:11,860 --> 00:08:13,110
- I know what it is.
- You know what it is, right?

247
00:08:13,110 --> 00:08:14,760
And this is how Lee Tae Oh looks
when he's in trouble.

248
00:08:15,410 --> 00:08:17,930
(He does look like Lee Tae Oh
for some reason.)

249
00:08:19,370 --> 00:08:20,480
Try it together.

250
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:22,720
(Everyone thinks it's so funny.)

251
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:24,240
- Wait. Suk Jin.
- What?

252
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:25,740
You didn't watch the show.
Do you know what this is?

253
00:08:25,740 --> 00:08:27,490
- To be honest, I don't.
- Then why did you laugh?

254
00:08:27,590 --> 00:08:28,990
Should I cry then?

255
00:08:28,990 --> 00:08:32,620
(Should I cry when everyone
else is laughing?)

256
00:08:33,290 --> 00:08:34,660
- Why did you laugh?
- I mean...

257
00:08:34,660 --> 00:08:35,860
- Should I...
- Why...

258
00:08:36,190 --> 00:08:37,720
It's just that I didn't laugh
that hard.

259
00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:40,170
- You should be honest on TV.
- I should be honest?

260
00:08:40,170 --> 00:08:42,270
- Should I cry? Should I frown?
- Why did you laugh?

261
00:08:42,270 --> 00:08:43,670
You don't even know what this is.

262
00:08:43,670 --> 00:08:46,330
I just laughed
because everyone else did.

263
00:08:46,370 --> 00:08:48,460
- He should laugh with us.
- Of course.

264
00:08:48,460 --> 00:08:50,180
All right. Next up is...

265
00:08:50,380 --> 00:08:51,570
Sana.

266
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:53,100
- Sana already talked.
- Sana already talked.

267
00:08:53,100 --> 00:08:54,340
- You can do this!
- What's with you?

268
00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:58,280
(He just talked to Sana.)

269
00:08:58,570 --> 00:09:00,020
- What's with you?
- You can do this!

270
00:09:00,020 --> 00:09:01,440
- Let's give him a hug.
- You can do this!

271
00:09:01,620 --> 00:09:03,890
- Give him a hug.
- You're too nervous.

272
00:09:03,890 --> 00:09:05,520
- You don't have to be nervous.
- It's okay.

273
00:09:05,520 --> 00:09:06,660
(Embarrassed, he gulps down water.)

274
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:08,350
- It's okay.
- We can do this!

275
00:09:08,350 --> 00:09:09,590
- We can do this!
- We can do this!

276
00:09:09,820 --> 00:09:11,760
(We can do this too!)

277
00:09:12,670 --> 00:09:14,430
(TWICE is full of energy.)

278
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,640
- Should we throw in the towel?
- Today...

279
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:17,870
It's okay.

280
00:09:17,930 --> 00:09:19,370
We're at war with TWICE today.

281
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:21,300
We can do this.

282
00:09:21,330 --> 00:09:24,230
All right. Next up is Nayeon.

283
00:09:24,700 --> 00:09:28,300
Fans say that some idol singers
look like juicy fruits.

284
00:09:28,570 --> 00:09:32,120
Can you compare
the Running Man members to fruits?

285
00:09:32,210 --> 00:09:33,550
Me?

286
00:09:33,650 --> 00:09:36,080
We've been compared to animals
and many other things,

287
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:37,620
but never fruits.

288
00:09:37,620 --> 00:09:39,890
- That's right.
- That'd be fun.

289
00:09:39,890 --> 00:09:41,290
Can't I compare you guys
to vegetables?

290
00:09:41,350 --> 00:09:43,220
- Vegetables are okay too.
- Vegetables count too.

291
00:09:43,300 --> 00:09:44,760
- Just tell us what you think.
- Okay.

292
00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:46,060
- It's just the appearance.
- Vegetables or fruits.

293
00:09:46,060 --> 00:09:48,090
- This is going to be interesting.
- I can't wait.

294
00:09:48,090 --> 00:09:49,730
What does Jae Suk look like?

295
00:09:49,730 --> 00:09:50,870
- What do I look like?
- Jae Suk.

296
00:09:51,090 --> 00:09:52,600
- Bean sprouts.
- Bean sprouts?

297
00:09:52,910 --> 00:09:54,510
You do look like them.

298
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:56,330
- You slightly look like them.
- You look like them.

299
00:09:56,330 --> 00:09:58,100
- You look like bean sprouts.
- You do look like them.

300
00:09:58,100 --> 00:10:00,380
- Okay.
- You look like them.

301
00:10:00,650 --> 00:10:03,550
- I had bean sprouts this morning.
- Dried-up bean sprouts.

302
00:10:03,650 --> 00:10:04,810
- Bean sprouts.
- All right.

303
00:10:04,810 --> 00:10:05,980
What about Haha?

304
00:10:05,980 --> 00:10:07,920
What's that called?

305
00:10:08,150 --> 00:10:09,390
Pickled radishes
you eat with fried chicken.

306
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:10,620
- Pickled radishes?
- Pickled radishes?

307
00:10:10,620 --> 00:10:12,950
(Pickled radishes)

308
00:10:14,630 --> 00:10:16,550
It smells bad.

309
00:10:17,030 --> 00:10:19,400
- I love that.
- They're very nice and refreshing.

310
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:21,900
They're nice. They go very well
with fried chicken.

311
00:10:21,900 --> 00:10:23,060
They're a perfect match.

312
00:10:23,060 --> 00:10:24,540
- Pickled radishes?
- I love that.

313
00:10:24,540 --> 00:10:25,910
- I've never heard that before.
- Even the juice is tasty.

314
00:10:25,910 --> 00:10:27,960
- That's hilarious.
- Right.

315
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:29,280
What about Se Chan?

316
00:10:29,330 --> 00:10:33,340
- No one has compared me to fruit.
- It's not going to be a good one.

317
00:10:33,410 --> 00:10:34,570
A durian?

318
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:36,120
A guava?

319
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:37,280
(They recommend tropical fruits.)

320
00:10:38,050 --> 00:10:39,650
- A blueberry.
- A blueberry?

321
00:10:39,650 --> 00:10:41,620
- Se Chan looks like a blueberry?
- Why?

322
00:10:41,620 --> 00:10:43,710
Aren't you being too mean?
Why would you call him a blueberry?

323
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:45,790
- Why do I look like a blueberry?
- Why does he look like a blueberry?

324
00:10:46,550 --> 00:10:47,890
Well...

325
00:10:47,890 --> 00:10:49,320
She doesn't like blueberries.

326
00:10:50,500 --> 00:10:51,950
She doesn't like blueberries.

327
00:10:54,130 --> 00:10:57,000
(No one questions it anymore.)

328
00:10:57,170 --> 00:10:58,800
What were you expecting?

329
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,270
For a second...

330
00:11:00,430 --> 00:11:01,960
It was because she doesn't like me.

331
00:11:01,960 --> 00:11:03,180
Now I understand.

332
00:11:03,180 --> 00:11:04,910
- Now I understand.
- That feels a lot better.

333
00:11:04,910 --> 00:11:06,280
I didn't understand at first.

334
00:11:06,280 --> 00:11:07,650
- Okay.
- Now I understand.

335
00:11:07,650 --> 00:11:09,280
- Please step back.
- There was a reason.

336
00:11:09,280 --> 00:11:10,880
I think I know
what Kwang Soo looks like.

337
00:11:10,970 --> 00:11:12,810
- Really?
- What does Kwang Soo look like?

338
00:11:13,150 --> 00:11:14,290
A yam.

339
00:11:14,290 --> 00:11:16,760
(A yam)

340
00:11:17,080 --> 00:11:18,790
- I was thinking of that.
- A yam?

341
00:11:18,790 --> 00:11:20,050
Seriously...

342
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:21,580
- I was thinking of that.
- He looks like it.

343
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:23,430
- Unbelievable.
- He looks like a yam.

344
00:11:23,430 --> 00:11:24,550
That's hilarious.

345
00:11:25,300 --> 00:11:26,820
That's so funny.

346
00:11:26,820 --> 00:11:29,270
- Unbelievable.
- He looks like a yam.

347
00:11:29,590 --> 00:11:31,170
- That makes sense.
- Goodness.

348
00:11:31,170 --> 00:11:33,730
A yam was perfect.

349
00:11:33,730 --> 00:11:36,070
- Everything she said makes sense.
- Totally.

350
00:11:36,070 --> 00:11:38,280
Everything was perfect.

351
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:40,410
By the way, I'm so happy...

352
00:11:40,410 --> 00:11:42,410
- to have all members here.
- It's great.

353
00:11:42,410 --> 00:11:46,310
Today, the mission fund
and the captains are very important.

354
00:11:46,310 --> 00:11:48,250
It's the Running Man Captain Race.

355
00:11:49,020 --> 00:11:51,480
According to the results of each
round, each team will receive...

356
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:54,980
an amount between 500 dollars
and minus 200 dollars.

357
00:11:55,530 --> 00:11:59,030
The money will be distributed
among the members by the captain.

358
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:01,560
The captains can give all the money
to one member if they want,

359
00:12:01,560 --> 00:12:03,300
which makes the captains
absolutely powerful.

360
00:12:03,830 --> 00:12:06,960
And everyone can see
how the money is distributed.

361
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:10,780
After the money is distributed,
you can stand up to your captain...

362
00:12:10,780 --> 00:12:12,650
by trying to take
the captain position away.

363
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:14,470
You can try to become
the next captain...

364
00:12:14,470 --> 00:12:16,520
using your money in the next round.

365
00:12:17,250 --> 00:12:20,150
Whoever bets the biggest amount
becomes the next captain.

366
00:12:20,710 --> 00:12:23,080
After the race,
the top five people...

367
00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:26,430
with the most money
will receive prizes.

368
00:12:26,820 --> 00:12:29,500
The bottom three will be penalized.

369
00:12:29,660 --> 00:12:30,900
- The top 5?
- The top 5?

370
00:12:30,900 --> 00:12:33,500
Teams will be decided randomly.

371
00:12:33,560 --> 00:12:37,040
(Team Selection Result)

372
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:38,230
- Sana!
- Sana!

373
00:12:38,330 --> 00:12:40,410
- Okay! Chaeyoung and Momo!
- Yes!

374
00:12:40,410 --> 00:12:41,640
- And Mina.
- Mina.

375
00:12:41,700 --> 00:12:42,880
- Yes!
- All right!

376
00:12:44,510 --> 00:12:46,650
Each team will go
to a different place...

377
00:12:46,650 --> 00:12:48,940
to decide the captain.

378
00:12:49,180 --> 00:12:52,250
- Please change first.
- Okay.

379
00:12:52,250 --> 00:12:53,290
(They'll change and
move to different places...)

380
00:12:53,290 --> 00:12:54,310
(to decide the captains.)

381
00:12:55,210 --> 00:12:57,050
The captains have more power.

382
00:12:57,660 --> 00:12:59,550
Who should be the captain?

383
00:13:00,050 --> 00:13:02,260
While you were away,
I tried to win their support.

384
00:13:02,950 --> 00:13:05,530
I told them,
"If you choose me, I'll..."

385
00:13:05,660 --> 00:13:06,820
"You can wait and see."

386
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:09,190
- Today...
- It's TWICE's day.

387
00:13:09,190 --> 00:13:11,640
- They should decide.
- Right.

388
00:13:11,770 --> 00:13:15,410
We have a shared bank account,

389
00:13:15,410 --> 00:13:17,280
- and Jihyo manages it.
- Really?

390
00:13:17,280 --> 00:13:18,540
- That's perfect.
- Then it's decided.

391
00:13:18,540 --> 00:13:19,970
Are you the general affairs manager?

392
00:13:19,970 --> 00:13:23,020
And no money has ever disappeared?

393
00:13:23,020 --> 00:13:25,280
It's happened,
but I always put the money back.

394
00:13:25,280 --> 00:13:27,080
- It's happened?
- It's happened?

395
00:13:27,080 --> 00:13:28,810
(Shocked)

396
00:13:28,810 --> 00:13:31,980
For example, when I buy
a birthday cake for a member,

397
00:13:31,980 --> 00:13:34,550
- I use our money first.
- You use the team's money.

398
00:13:34,550 --> 00:13:35,930
- But you put it back?
- Yes.

399
00:13:35,930 --> 00:13:38,350
- That's understandable.
- Right.

400
00:13:39,090 --> 00:13:41,030
- We could take turns.
- Really?

401
00:13:41,030 --> 00:13:42,830
- Every round?
- All right.

402
00:13:42,830 --> 00:13:44,430
- If we bet...
- Exactly.

403
00:13:44,430 --> 00:13:45,930
So Min is touching this.

404
00:13:45,930 --> 00:13:47,800
- Because it's so pretty.
- Be careful.

405
00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:49,270
I'm touching it
because it's pretty.

406
00:13:49,270 --> 00:13:50,430
So Min has...

407
00:13:51,010 --> 00:13:52,070
Sticky fingers?

408
00:13:52,070 --> 00:13:53,750
(Kwang Soo is slapped.)

409
00:13:54,010 --> 00:13:56,280
(So Min slaps Kwang Soo
so that he can't say anything.)

410
00:13:56,280 --> 00:13:57,620
If it disappears, suspect So Min.

411
00:13:58,120 --> 00:14:00,080
You'll find it in her pocket.

412
00:14:00,080 --> 00:14:01,620
- He's so annoying.
- I'm serious.

413
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:04,160
She touched it because she likes it.

414
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:05,390
- I just think it's pretty.
- I mean it.

415
00:14:05,390 --> 00:14:06,930
Before you know it,

416
00:14:06,930 --> 00:14:09,180
it'll be replaced with
some plastic bag. I'm serious.

417
00:14:09,450 --> 00:14:11,450
- Stop buttering her up.
- What?

418
00:14:11,450 --> 00:14:13,500
- You're buttering her up.
- I'm buttering her up?

419
00:14:13,500 --> 00:14:15,000
Yes, you are.

420
00:14:15,370 --> 00:14:16,870
He's buttering her up, right?

421
00:14:17,230 --> 00:14:19,640
Should we decide the captain here?

422
00:14:19,910 --> 00:14:21,230
I just don't want to end up
in the bottom three.

423
00:14:21,930 --> 00:14:23,300
- Guys.
- Yes?

424
00:14:23,300 --> 00:14:24,570
We're going to start...

425
00:14:24,680 --> 00:14:27,300
the Cheer Up! Unexpected
Name Tag Elimination.

426
00:14:27,300 --> 00:14:29,010
- What are you saying?
- Already?

427
00:14:29,010 --> 00:14:30,920
- We'll start Name Tag Elimination.
- What?

428
00:14:30,920 --> 00:14:32,750
(Name tag elimination
all of a sudden?)

429
00:14:32,810 --> 00:14:34,150
As soon as we start?

430
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:35,620
- What?
- What?

431
00:14:35,840 --> 00:14:37,260
But we're a team, right?

432
00:14:37,390 --> 00:14:40,550
We're going to start the Cheer Up!
Unexpected Name Tag Elimination.

433
00:14:40,980 --> 00:14:42,680
(Grabbing)

434
00:14:42,680 --> 00:14:44,630
- What?
- What's going on?

435
00:14:44,630 --> 00:14:46,430
(As soon as she hears
the announcement,)

436
00:14:46,430 --> 00:14:47,930
(So Min rips off
Jeongyeon's name tag.)

437
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:49,670
- We haven't started yet.
- See?

438
00:14:49,670 --> 00:14:50,690
Jeongyeon, did you see that?

439
00:14:50,690 --> 00:14:52,330
(There will be an announcement.)

440
00:14:52,960 --> 00:14:54,700
- So Min!
- Did you see that?

441
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:57,300
- So Min!
- That's how she is.

442
00:14:57,410 --> 00:14:58,880
- How could you...
- I was trying to protect you.

443
00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:01,470
Did you see how I was
trying to protect you?

444
00:15:02,280 --> 00:15:03,710
- So Min.
- Jeongyeon, you got the wrong idea.

445
00:15:03,810 --> 00:15:05,520
- Jeongyeon.
- Can you eliminate...

446
00:15:05,520 --> 00:15:06,840
a team member?

447
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:08,810
- So Min should be out!
- Gosh, this is crazy.

448
00:15:08,920 --> 00:15:10,290
All right.

449
00:15:10,290 --> 00:15:11,480
Let's hear the rules now.

450
00:15:11,480 --> 00:15:13,680
All teams will play Name Tag
Elimination at the same time.

451
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:17,800
A team is out of the game
when all members are eliminated.

452
00:15:18,030 --> 00:15:21,060
Money will be distributed according
to how long each team lasts.

453
00:15:21,190 --> 00:15:22,720
We have Jong Kook.

454
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:26,510
Whoever survives longest
in each team becomes the captain...

455
00:15:26,510 --> 00:15:28,370
regardless of the team's result.

456
00:15:28,370 --> 00:15:30,410
(Whoever survives longest
in each team becomes the captain.)

457
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:33,100
(To become the captain
with the right to distribute money,)

458
00:15:33,100 --> 00:15:34,410
(survive longer
than your team members.)

459
00:15:34,410 --> 00:15:37,520
If you think your team is
going to lose,

460
00:15:37,780 --> 00:15:39,890
you could try to become
the captain instead...

461
00:15:39,940 --> 00:15:40,980
by eliminating your team members.

462
00:15:40,980 --> 00:15:42,150
(You can become the captain
by eliminating your team members.)

463
00:15:42,150 --> 00:15:43,480
- Can we eliminate our team members?
- Yes.

464
00:15:43,480 --> 00:15:45,890
- That's too mean.
- Hold on.

465
00:15:45,890 --> 00:15:47,760
- That's too...
- We couldn't do that.

466
00:15:47,760 --> 00:15:48,850
No way.

467
00:15:48,850 --> 00:15:50,760
- We couldn't do that, could we?
- Never.

468
00:15:50,760 --> 00:15:52,000
- Are you sure?
- Yes.

469
00:15:52,300 --> 00:15:54,530
- We shouldn't eliminate each other.
- Not yet.

470
00:15:55,370 --> 00:15:57,930
You should try to survive
for a long time...

471
00:15:57,930 --> 00:16:00,100
to become the captain...

472
00:16:00,100 --> 00:16:01,330
and save the team.

473
00:16:01,330 --> 00:16:03,200
Haha, Chaeyoung keeps calculating.

474
00:16:03,300 --> 00:16:04,410
- Really?
- Chaeyoung.

475
00:16:04,540 --> 00:16:06,800
If you keep calculating,
I'll rip off your name tag first.

476
00:16:07,100 --> 00:16:09,250
- You shouldn't do that. Not yet.
- Stop thinking.

477
00:16:09,340 --> 00:16:12,620
There are envelopes
hidden all over the place.

478
00:16:12,620 --> 00:16:15,440
The envelopes have money in them,

479
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:16,810
which belongs to the person
who finds it.

480
00:16:17,050 --> 00:16:18,760
- The person who finds it?
- Yes.

481
00:16:18,850 --> 00:16:21,530
Try to find as much money as
you can before you get eliminated.

482
00:16:22,080 --> 00:16:23,630
At the same time,
try to become the captain.

483
00:16:23,720 --> 00:16:25,000
Do you understand what he said?

484
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,320
- Rip off others' name tags.
- Okay.

485
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:27,820
You can rip off the name tags
of your team members too.

486
00:16:27,820 --> 00:16:29,090
(Se Chan adds.)

487
00:16:29,090 --> 00:16:30,540
No, don't do that.

488
00:16:30,540 --> 00:16:31,730
You can eliminate
your team members too.

489
00:16:31,930 --> 00:16:33,930
- Let's say two of us are left.
- Let me see.

490
00:16:33,930 --> 00:16:35,430
Can we start now?

491
00:16:35,430 --> 00:16:36,780
- Not yet.
- You saw something?

492
00:16:37,570 --> 00:16:39,330
- Is someone out there?
- No one.

493
00:16:40,180 --> 00:16:42,250
- Did you find money?
- No.

494
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:43,940
Okay, there it is.

495
00:16:44,570 --> 00:16:47,340
Whoever picks that up,
I'll eliminate that person.

496
00:16:47,340 --> 00:16:49,760
How about we play
rock-paper-scissors?

497
00:16:50,080 --> 00:16:51,480
- Okay.
- That's a good idea.

498
00:16:51,760 --> 00:16:53,220
- Rock-paper-scissors.
- Rock-paper-scissors.

499
00:16:53,220 --> 00:16:54,290
- Yes!
- Okay.

500
00:16:55,180 --> 00:16:56,760
- Rock-paper-scissors.
- No!

501
00:16:56,760 --> 00:16:58,430
(Se Chan wins and gets the money.)

502
00:16:58,430 --> 00:16:59,530
I'll have 10 more dollars
from the beginning.

503
00:16:59,530 --> 00:17:02,000
- I can try to pick it up, right?
- Of course.

504
00:17:02,500 --> 00:17:04,690
Hey, wait. You can't do that.

505
00:17:04,800 --> 00:17:06,060
Why did we even play
rock-paper-scissors?

506
00:17:06,330 --> 00:17:08,410
- Dahyun has a point.
- Right?

507
00:17:08,540 --> 00:17:10,080
Let's start the race.

508
00:17:10,080 --> 00:17:11,730
5, 4...

509
00:17:11,730 --> 00:17:14,000
- Hold on.
- Why...

510
00:17:14,580 --> 00:17:16,110
- Here we go.
- 5, 4,

511
00:17:16,850 --> 00:17:19,740
3, 2, 1.

512
00:17:19,920 --> 00:17:21,120
The race starts.

513
00:17:21,120 --> 00:17:22,650
(The race starts.)

514
00:17:23,060 --> 00:17:24,320
Stay away from the money.

515
00:17:24,320 --> 00:17:26,090
- Gosh.
- I can't believe her.

516
00:17:26,090 --> 00:17:27,220
- Yes!
- Seriously.

517
00:17:27,220 --> 00:17:29,060
- How much is it?
- How much is it?

518
00:17:29,060 --> 00:17:30,160
(In the envelope...)

519
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:31,400
- It's 10 dollars.
- That's not bad.

520
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:32,490
Put it in your bag.

521
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:34,830
I shouldn't lose it, right?

522
00:17:34,830 --> 00:17:36,340
- Put it in your bag.
- Put it in your pocket.

523
00:17:37,100 --> 00:17:39,760
- We should try to find money.
- Right.

524
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:42,170
It might be hidden around here.

525
00:17:42,170 --> 00:17:43,680
(Where is the money?)

526
00:17:45,380 --> 00:17:48,240
(A surprise attack)

527
00:17:48,500 --> 00:17:50,510
- Be careful of these attacks.
- This is...

528
00:17:51,080 --> 00:17:52,980
- Be careful of these attacks.
- This is...

529
00:17:52,980 --> 00:17:54,180
I just wanted to try.

530
00:17:54,180 --> 00:17:55,350
I wanted to tell you to be careful.

531
00:17:55,350 --> 00:17:57,060
(I thought he was
ripping off my name tag.)

532
00:17:57,620 --> 00:17:59,660
- I don't want to be eliminated.
- My heart is racing.

533
00:17:59,660 --> 00:18:01,090
My heart is suddenly
beating so fast.

534
00:18:01,930 --> 00:18:03,130
There it is.

535
00:18:03,130 --> 00:18:04,560
(Jeongyeon has good eyesight.)

536
00:18:04,560 --> 00:18:05,990
(She found an envelope
on the 1st floor.)

537
00:18:05,990 --> 00:18:07,830
I want to go downstairs.

538
00:18:09,130 --> 00:18:10,340
Don't go off on your own.

539
00:18:10,340 --> 00:18:11,900
- What?
- You shouldn't be alone.

540
00:18:11,900 --> 00:18:13,310
You're scary.

541
00:18:13,430 --> 00:18:14,930
- I...
- Don't come any closer.

542
00:18:14,930 --> 00:18:16,700
(He's too fast that it doesn't seem
like he's protecting her.)

543
00:18:17,700 --> 00:18:20,470
(They run at full speed
toward the money Jeongyeon spotted.)

544
00:18:21,970 --> 00:18:23,080
Kwang Soo!

545
00:18:23,080 --> 00:18:24,440
Kwang Soo, how could you?

546
00:18:24,680 --> 00:18:26,270
(What?)

547
00:18:27,740 --> 00:18:29,180
Sorry, it's empty.

548
00:18:30,780 --> 00:18:31,860
What is this?

549
00:18:31,950 --> 00:18:33,180
There's nothing in there, right?

550
00:18:33,180 --> 00:18:34,950
(Se Chan arrives right then!)

551
00:18:34,950 --> 00:18:35,950
It's empty.

552
00:18:35,980 --> 00:18:38,720
- Jeongyeon...
- Tzuyu, this way.

553
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:40,720
Shouldn't we look
for the money first?

554
00:18:40,760 --> 00:18:43,290
Exactly. We should
gather the money first.

555
00:18:43,290 --> 00:18:44,430
It's Tzuyu.

556
00:18:44,430 --> 00:18:46,410
I see Jae Suk.

557
00:18:48,140 --> 00:18:49,260
It's Jae Suk.

558
00:18:49,640 --> 00:18:52,680
There are too many people.
I counted at least three.

559
00:18:52,680 --> 00:18:54,080
We should hide.

560
00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:55,270
(They decide to run away
from Team White.)

561
00:18:55,270 --> 00:18:56,580
- It's blocked.
- What?

562
00:18:57,350 --> 00:18:58,970
You've got to be kidding me.
This is bad.

563
00:18:58,970 --> 00:19:00,040
Guys, over here.

564
00:19:00,040 --> 00:19:01,420
- Don't be like this.
- Why?

565
00:19:01,510 --> 00:19:03,360
- You...
- I want to participate in the race.

566
00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:05,620
- The three of you...
- You can't be all cute.

567
00:19:05,620 --> 00:19:07,860
It's unfair to have 3 people
gang up on 2.

568
00:19:07,860 --> 00:19:10,490
You guys go ahead. I'll watch.

569
00:19:11,330 --> 00:19:12,630
I think I hear our teammates.

570
00:19:13,170 --> 00:19:14,490
- I promise.
- Come on.

571
00:19:14,490 --> 00:19:15,960
You can't...

572
00:19:15,960 --> 00:19:17,570
Be careful!

573
00:19:17,570 --> 00:19:18,570
(Ripping off)

574
00:19:19,670 --> 00:19:21,310
(So Min's surprise attack)

575
00:19:21,310 --> 00:19:22,310
What's going on?

576
00:19:22,340 --> 00:19:23,430
What?

577
00:19:23,430 --> 00:19:24,470
(Jae Suk joins them.)

578
00:19:24,470 --> 00:19:25,500
Hurry!

579
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:26,580
Dahyun, you're out.

580
00:19:26,580 --> 00:19:28,610
Rip So Min's name tag off.

581
00:19:28,610 --> 00:19:29,850
(Jae Suk rips off
So Min's name tag.)

582
00:19:29,850 --> 00:19:31,240
- So Min, you're out.
- I still...

583
00:19:31,240 --> 00:19:33,210
- eliminated someone.
- There's no other way.

584
00:19:33,210 --> 00:19:35,620
- Get her name tag. Gosh, Nayeon.
- She got it.

585
00:19:36,390 --> 00:19:37,390
Nayeon, you're out.

586
00:19:37,390 --> 00:19:38,780
- She got it.
- Good.

587
00:19:38,860 --> 00:19:40,830
(Nayeon of Team Orange is out.)

588
00:19:40,860 --> 00:19:41,930
- Are you all right?
- Are you okay?

589
00:19:41,930 --> 00:19:42,950
(She suddenly bursts out laughing.)

590
00:19:42,950 --> 00:19:44,160
My hair was ripped out!

591
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:45,250
- What?
- What?

592
00:19:45,250 --> 00:19:46,720
(My hair was ripped out!)

593
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:47,900
- What the...
- What is that?

594
00:19:47,900 --> 00:19:49,170
(Her name tag was ripped off
and so was her hair.)

595
00:19:49,170 --> 00:19:50,460
Why did you rip out her hair?

596
00:19:50,460 --> 00:19:51,840
It was So Min.

597
00:19:52,230 --> 00:19:53,570
- My hair was ripped out.
- Sorry.

598
00:19:53,700 --> 00:19:56,170
Jeongyeon, don't go there.

599
00:19:56,730 --> 00:19:58,880
- Jeongyeon...
- We should help our team.

600
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:00,000
Forget about them.

601
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,310
What do you mean?

602
00:20:01,310 --> 00:20:02,580
- But...
- Forget about them.

603
00:20:02,580 --> 00:20:04,620
- Don't bother.
- We must help them!

604
00:20:04,620 --> 00:20:06,740
Just forget about them!

605
00:20:07,650 --> 00:20:08,820
Why did you rip out her hair?

606
00:20:08,940 --> 00:20:10,010
It was So Min.

607
00:20:10,010 --> 00:20:11,780
- Kwang Soo's coming.
- Sorry.

608
00:20:11,920 --> 00:20:14,360
(Kwang Soo bulldozes forward
to assess the situation.)

609
00:20:15,060 --> 00:20:16,790
It's 3 against 2. Let's get them!

610
00:20:16,790 --> 00:20:18,160
(We have the advantage.)

611
00:20:18,160 --> 00:20:19,790
(He makes a run for it.)

612
00:20:21,370 --> 00:20:23,340
(What's going on?)

613
00:20:24,490 --> 00:20:26,400
(He runs for it
leaving Jeongyeon behind.)

614
00:20:27,430 --> 00:20:30,810
(If Jeongyeon is eliminated,
Kwang Soo will be the captain.)

615
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,470
- There's Jeongyeon.
- Let's get her. Come here!

616
00:20:34,470 --> 00:20:35,810
I also see Haha.

617
00:20:35,850 --> 00:20:37,080
Nice.

618
00:20:37,080 --> 00:20:38,120
It's a death trap.

619
00:20:38,120 --> 00:20:39,270
(I'll be eliminated there.)

620
00:20:41,480 --> 00:20:43,950
All that matters
is that I stay alive.

621
00:20:44,620 --> 00:20:46,320
- Haha...
- Watch your backs.

622
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:47,980
You guys can eliminate Jeongyeon.

623
00:20:47,980 --> 00:20:49,680
- No, please don't.
- We don't have a choice.

624
00:20:49,680 --> 00:20:51,250
- Please help me.
- We'll help.

625
00:20:51,250 --> 00:20:52,520
- No, no.
- Let us help.

626
00:20:52,660 --> 00:20:53,870
Jeongyeon, be careful.

627
00:20:53,870 --> 00:20:55,460
Come any closer
and I'll go after you.

628
00:20:55,460 --> 00:20:57,600
Where on earth did Kwang Soo go?

629
00:20:58,260 --> 00:20:59,490
Hasn't Jeongyeon
been eliminated yet?

630
00:20:59,490 --> 00:21:00,700
(He checks again.)

631
00:21:00,700 --> 00:21:02,930
Why hasn't she been
when she's surrounded?

632
00:21:05,080 --> 00:21:06,540
Let's call a truce.

633
00:21:07,380 --> 00:21:09,350
- We'll go after Kwang Soo first.
- Sure.

634
00:21:09,410 --> 00:21:12,580
Let's make Jeongyeon team captain
and go after Kwang Soo first.

635
00:21:12,710 --> 00:21:14,480
Jeongyeon, what do you say?

636
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:15,740
- I'd love that.
- Okay.

637
00:21:15,740 --> 00:21:17,950
Okay, gather around then.

638
00:21:17,950 --> 00:21:19,510
Jeongyeon, isn't it in
your best interest...

639
00:21:19,510 --> 00:21:20,950
to be team captain too?

640
00:21:20,950 --> 00:21:23,250
- Exactly.
- You can rip off his name tag.

641
00:21:23,250 --> 00:21:24,250
Do you get what I mean?

642
00:21:24,250 --> 00:21:26,160
- Eliminate him yourself.
- Go ahead.

643
00:21:26,160 --> 00:21:28,130
You should get going, Jeongyeon.

644
00:21:28,630 --> 00:21:30,290
- All right.
- Let's trust one another.

645
00:21:30,290 --> 00:21:32,030
- Of course.
- You go first.

646
00:21:32,030 --> 00:21:33,230
No, you go first.

647
00:21:33,260 --> 00:21:34,460
There's no need to worry.

648
00:21:34,670 --> 00:21:37,180
Just look at the members
on this team.

649
00:21:37,180 --> 00:21:38,840
The others will choose to run away.

650
00:21:38,930 --> 00:21:41,000
Over here. Jihyo, here you go.

651
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:44,470
(They even share
the money they find.)

652
00:21:44,470 --> 00:21:46,150
(Suk Jin wrecks the mood.)

653
00:21:46,270 --> 00:21:47,320
I'll give it back.

654
00:21:47,320 --> 00:21:49,440
I only played a joke
to keep you alerted.

655
00:21:50,060 --> 00:21:51,860
(It's an envelope!)

656
00:21:51,860 --> 00:21:53,220
(Suk Jin constantly trains them
to be on high alert.)

657
00:21:53,220 --> 00:21:54,750
Jihyo!

658
00:21:56,130 --> 00:21:58,190
(Thanks to Suk Jin,
they collect a lot of money.)

659
00:21:58,190 --> 00:21:59,990
You guys are good at spotting these.

660
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:03,460
(Meanwhile, Kwang Soo
searches for the money.)

661
00:22:03,460 --> 00:22:04,570
Where is he?

662
00:22:04,570 --> 00:22:05,870
Kwang Soo?

663
00:22:05,990 --> 00:22:07,410
Kwang Soo!

664
00:22:08,670 --> 00:22:09,810
Why weren't you eliminated?

665
00:22:10,140 --> 00:22:13,140
I can't believe
you just left me there.

666
00:22:13,140 --> 00:22:15,700
- I didn't run away.
- You traitor.

667
00:22:15,810 --> 00:22:18,270
- I didn't...
- You wanted to be the captain.

668
00:22:18,380 --> 00:22:19,770
I was trying
to draw them away from you.

669
00:22:19,770 --> 00:22:21,210
As if.

670
00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:23,320
You ran away and left me there.

671
00:22:23,320 --> 00:22:24,390
Jeongyeon, let's go.

672
00:22:24,390 --> 00:22:25,820
(Just then...)

673
00:22:25,820 --> 00:22:26,890
Jeongyeon, run!

674
00:22:27,180 --> 00:22:28,630
- Run!
- See?

675
00:22:28,630 --> 00:22:29,860
He's leaving me behind again.

676
00:22:29,860 --> 00:22:31,190
(Kwang Soo runs off once again.)

677
00:22:31,190 --> 00:22:32,290
Jeongyeon, hurry.

678
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:34,520
Why don't we go up?

679
00:22:34,520 --> 00:22:36,170
- Is that possible?
- Sure.

680
00:22:36,570 --> 00:22:38,400
(Grabbing)

681
00:22:39,570 --> 00:22:41,370
(That was close.)

682
00:22:42,070 --> 00:22:43,880
(She's suddenly embarrassed.)

683
00:22:44,030 --> 00:22:45,270
Kwang Soo, I'm sorry.

684
00:22:45,270 --> 00:22:47,610
(So this is how it feels
to be betrayed.)

685
00:22:47,610 --> 00:22:49,040
Can we make up?

686
00:22:49,110 --> 00:22:50,380
Do you consider us a team?

687
00:22:51,150 --> 00:22:52,150
Let's make up.

688
00:22:52,940 --> 00:22:54,590
We have to be a team
for the entire day.

689
00:22:54,590 --> 00:22:55,980
- Right.
- Must you be this way?

690
00:22:56,350 --> 00:22:58,280
- I won't.
- What will become of us?

691
00:22:58,320 --> 00:22:59,710
Let's get going then.

692
00:22:59,820 --> 00:23:01,430
I won't betray you again. I promise.

693
00:23:02,430 --> 00:23:04,290
We'll walk side by side.

694
00:23:06,490 --> 00:23:09,020
(Reaching out)

695
00:23:09,020 --> 00:23:11,490
(He can't help be
the traitor he is.)

696
00:23:11,490 --> 00:23:13,340
Okay, fine.
Let's go upstairs for now.

697
00:23:14,670 --> 00:23:16,700
(Running)

698
00:23:16,700 --> 00:23:18,840
(Kwang Soo spots an envelope.)

699
00:23:19,340 --> 00:23:21,970
(He then suddenly
runs off somewhere.)

700
00:23:21,970 --> 00:23:24,740
(Meanwhile, Jeongyeon
runs the other way.)

701
00:23:24,740 --> 00:23:27,620
(She runs into Team Gray.)

702
00:23:28,650 --> 00:23:32,480
(Kwang Soo makes a run for it
using Jeongyeon as bait.)

703
00:23:32,950 --> 00:23:35,130
- No...
- Guys, get her.

704
00:23:35,130 --> 00:23:36,900
- Please don't.
- Finish her.

705
00:23:37,330 --> 00:23:38,690
Eliminate her.

706
00:23:38,690 --> 00:23:39,830
(Jeongyeon tries
to fight the inevitable.)

707
00:23:40,290 --> 00:23:42,520
Be careful though.

708
00:23:42,690 --> 00:23:43,840
Kwang Soo...

709
00:23:44,290 --> 00:23:46,490
Kwang Soo ran away again.

710
00:23:48,570 --> 00:23:51,080
It's every man for himself.

711
00:23:52,910 --> 00:23:54,040
- Sorry about this.
- Kwang Soo...

712
00:23:54,040 --> 00:23:56,080
- We're sorry.
- You should've been alone.

713
00:23:56,080 --> 00:23:57,540
(Poor Jeongyeon's name tag
was ripped off.)

714
00:23:58,350 --> 00:24:00,480
(Jeongyeon of Team Orange
is eliminated.)

715
00:24:00,940 --> 00:24:02,010
Gosh.

716
00:24:02,210 --> 00:24:04,010
- Kwang Soo...
- He ran away.

717
00:24:04,010 --> 00:24:06,010
We should teach him a lesson then.
Let's go.

718
00:24:06,860 --> 00:24:08,130
That traitor.

719
00:24:09,390 --> 00:24:13,190
(Kwang Soo has been decided
as Team Orange's captain.)

720
00:24:13,190 --> 00:24:14,260
Was she eliminated?

721
00:24:15,100 --> 00:24:16,290
Was Jeongyeon eliminated?

722
00:24:16,290 --> 00:24:17,370
Okay!

723
00:24:19,030 --> 00:24:20,670
You're the last to survive
on your team...

724
00:24:20,670 --> 00:24:22,260
which makes you the captain.

725
00:24:23,110 --> 00:24:25,340
(He gathers his hands.)

726
00:24:25,840 --> 00:24:27,500
(Glancing)

727
00:24:30,580 --> 00:24:33,420
This is my mourning for Jeongyeon.
I feel terrible.

728
00:24:35,010 --> 00:24:37,060
Nice. Let's do this!

729
00:24:37,280 --> 00:24:38,710
It's 5 against 3.

730
00:24:38,950 --> 00:24:40,330
- We'll eliminate all of you.
- Go ahead!

731
00:24:40,330 --> 00:24:42,250
- We're dead serious.
- I am too.

732
00:24:42,590 --> 00:24:44,130
- No.
- Bring it on.

733
00:24:45,060 --> 00:24:46,190
You're so cool, Haha.

734
00:24:46,190 --> 00:24:47,570
Hold your ground, guys.

735
00:24:47,930 --> 00:24:49,100
Wait, who's that?

736
00:24:49,190 --> 00:24:50,340
Someone's here.

737
00:24:50,340 --> 00:24:52,260
- Jeongyeon, did you get him?
- It's over.

738
00:24:52,260 --> 00:24:53,340
Did you eliminate him?

739
00:24:53,340 --> 00:24:54,530
- She got eliminated.
- She was eliminated instead.

740
00:24:55,460 --> 00:24:56,840
- Oh, dear.
- Who was it?

741
00:24:56,840 --> 00:24:58,030
Team Gray.

742
00:24:58,410 --> 00:24:59,580
What the...

743
00:24:59,970 --> 00:25:01,000
Team Gray.

744
00:25:01,540 --> 00:25:02,810
(Ripping off)

745
00:25:02,810 --> 00:25:03,850
I did well, right?

746
00:25:03,850 --> 00:25:05,270
Haha, you're out.

747
00:25:05,270 --> 00:25:06,820
- You four can get going.
- Go ahead.

748
00:25:06,820 --> 00:25:08,040
Get going.

749
00:25:08,040 --> 00:25:10,750
Did you have to do it this way?

750
00:25:11,620 --> 00:25:12,860
Instead...

751
00:25:12,860 --> 00:25:14,450
- We can go together.
- Let go of me!

752
00:25:14,680 --> 00:25:15,950
Let's start over.

753
00:25:16,060 --> 00:25:17,630
I'll let you eliminate me,

754
00:25:17,860 --> 00:25:19,600
so make it look like it was 1 on 1.

755
00:25:19,690 --> 00:25:21,670
- This just isn't right.
- Let's go to the prison.

756
00:25:21,670 --> 00:25:24,030
- Must I be eliminated this way?
- Bye.

757
00:25:24,030 --> 00:25:26,570
- Haha...
- Jeongyeon, wait.

758
00:25:26,570 --> 00:25:29,000
You acted all tough
but was caught off guard.

759
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:31,270
Must I be eliminated this way?

760
00:25:33,080 --> 00:25:34,310
Unbelievable, this is upsetting.

761
00:25:34,310 --> 00:25:35,500
Haha...

762
00:25:35,500 --> 00:25:38,040
It was 5 against 3.

763
00:25:38,040 --> 00:25:39,850
- It was 4 against 2 for us.
- Yes, 4 against 2.

764
00:25:39,850 --> 00:25:41,480
2 guys and 2 girls.

765
00:25:41,740 --> 00:25:42,740
(Sighing deeply)

766
00:25:42,740 --> 00:25:43,950
What's wrong?

767
00:25:43,950 --> 00:25:45,780
Nothing is going my way.

768
00:25:46,060 --> 00:25:47,830
- Same here.
- Absolutely nothing.

769
00:25:47,830 --> 00:25:49,950
Exactly. Nothing's
going my way either.

770
00:25:50,060 --> 00:25:51,220
I mean it.

771
00:25:51,220 --> 00:25:52,360
No one calls me anymore.

772
00:25:52,360 --> 00:25:53,490
(Depressed)

773
00:25:54,490 --> 00:25:56,290
- Give me your number.
- Me too.

774
00:25:56,290 --> 00:25:58,290
- Really? Can you text me sometime?
- Sure.

775
00:25:58,570 --> 00:26:00,500
I like texting others.

776
00:26:00,500 --> 00:26:03,200
I would've given out my number
if they had been male guests.

777
00:26:03,840 --> 00:26:06,200
(Since they're girls, she'll only
accept their gracious offer.)

778
00:26:06,200 --> 00:26:08,650
Can't you see that
I'm not pulling out my phone?

779
00:26:08,650 --> 00:26:11,440
Not one guest on this show
has asked me for my number...

780
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:13,350
for three whole years.
Can you believe it?

781
00:26:13,350 --> 00:26:15,350
- Isn't it insane, Jeongyeon?
- Does that normally happen though?

782
00:26:15,480 --> 00:26:18,620
- Exactly.
- I've never heard of it.

783
00:26:18,620 --> 00:26:20,060
Still...

784
00:26:20,060 --> 00:26:21,180
(When a guy and a girl meet...)

785
00:26:21,180 --> 00:26:23,450
Was there someone
you were particularly fond of?

786
00:26:24,450 --> 00:26:25,930
(She definitely liked someone.)

787
00:26:25,930 --> 00:26:26,930
There was.

788
00:26:26,930 --> 00:26:28,020
I think I know who it was.

789
00:26:28,520 --> 00:26:31,030
- Didn't you like Jinyoung?
- Yes, Jinyoung.

790
00:26:31,670 --> 00:26:34,000
- Isn't he super handsome?
- He is.

791
00:26:34,140 --> 00:26:37,140
It was the first time
I felt my heart do a flip.

792
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:38,880
He was incredibly handsome.

793
00:26:39,080 --> 00:26:40,650
Why didn't you ask
for his number instead?

794
00:26:40,650 --> 00:26:42,810
- Exactly.
- You could've asked him first.

795
00:26:42,810 --> 00:26:43,920
What?

796
00:26:43,920 --> 00:26:45,320
She was rejected.

797
00:26:46,890 --> 00:26:48,120
He openly rejected her.

798
00:26:48,120 --> 00:26:49,820
When did that happen?

799
00:26:49,820 --> 00:26:50,980
That never happened.

800
00:26:50,980 --> 00:26:53,630
Why would he reject
someone as sweet as you?

801
00:26:53,630 --> 00:26:56,990
Which celebrity had
your heart beating the fastest?

802
00:26:56,990 --> 00:26:59,060
- How can I answer that?
- It's more fun in here.

803
00:26:59,060 --> 00:27:00,170
(He's intrigued.)

804
00:27:00,460 --> 00:27:01,760
It's a talk show...

805
00:27:02,220 --> 00:27:03,220
which is what I love.

806
00:27:03,220 --> 00:27:06,070
How can I name all of them?
There were so many.

807
00:27:06,070 --> 00:27:09,260
Which celebrity
is close to your dream guy?

808
00:27:09,340 --> 00:27:11,430
There must be an actor or singer...

809
00:27:11,430 --> 00:27:13,940
whom you thought
was cool or handsome.

810
00:27:13,940 --> 00:27:15,500
For me, it was Yang Se Hyeong.

811
00:27:15,500 --> 00:27:17,270
- What?
- That's right. She said it before.

812
00:27:17,270 --> 00:27:19,510
And yet you asked me that question?

813
00:27:19,740 --> 00:27:21,040
- Se Hyeong?
- Yes.

814
00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:22,650
- Do you like Se Chan too?
- Yes.

815
00:27:23,510 --> 00:27:25,950
But in person, he's quite ugly.

816
00:27:27,130 --> 00:27:29,860
(They're dazzled
by her brutal opinion.)

817
00:27:30,790 --> 00:27:32,990
(She strikes with hard facts.)

818
00:27:33,160 --> 00:27:35,900
(Meanwhile, Kwang Soo...)

819
00:27:36,760 --> 00:27:38,340
Since the team captain
will be put to a vote afterward,

820
00:27:38,340 --> 00:27:40,610
this will be my last time as one.

821
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:43,500
I'll collect what I can
while I have the chance...

822
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:45,340
and leave for good.

823
00:27:46,970 --> 00:27:49,380
I'm sure he's here somewhere.

824
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:54,120
- Over there.
- Where?

825
00:27:54,120 --> 00:27:55,280
Here's Kwang Soo.

826
00:27:55,420 --> 00:27:57,280
(They found the traitor.)

827
00:27:57,280 --> 00:27:58,390
He's here.

828
00:27:58,390 --> 00:27:59,420
Kwang Soo!

829
00:27:59,420 --> 00:28:01,750
(The others finally
caught up with Kwang Soo.)

830
00:28:04,160 --> 00:28:06,860
(He runs at high speed
for over 5 minutes.)

831
00:28:07,130 --> 00:28:09,490
(Kwang Soo's cameraman
has given up on filming him.)

832
00:28:09,520 --> 00:28:11,290
Where is he going
without his cameraman?

833
00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:12,790
Yes.

834
00:28:13,260 --> 00:28:14,370
Give up.

835
00:28:14,370 --> 00:28:16,030
(Kwang Soo stops at a dead end.)

836
00:28:16,030 --> 00:28:18,530
You're in first place anyway.
Jae Suk.

837
00:28:18,910 --> 00:28:20,310
(When Se Chan is about to
eliminate him,)

838
00:28:20,310 --> 00:28:21,310
Kwang Soo.

839
00:28:21,310 --> 00:28:23,000
(he takes out 10 dollars
from his pocket.)

840
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:24,770
I'll let you go.

841
00:28:25,270 --> 00:28:26,510
I'll let you go.

842
00:28:26,770 --> 00:28:29,120
I'll rip Jae Suk's name tag.

843
00:28:29,590 --> 00:28:31,010
Okay, let's rip his.

844
00:28:31,160 --> 00:28:33,980
Jae Suk, Kwang Soo gave me
10 dollars.

845
00:28:33,980 --> 00:28:35,520
Hey, you're doing this
over 10 dollars?

846
00:28:35,520 --> 00:28:37,900
(Petty offenders are easily
swayed by small amounts of money.)

847
00:28:37,900 --> 00:28:40,900
Kwang Soo, if you give Jae Suk
10 dollars too, we'll let you go.

848
00:28:41,900 --> 00:28:43,570
- What?
- Give him 10 dollars.

849
00:28:43,570 --> 00:28:45,100
Or he might rip yours.

850
00:28:45,100 --> 00:28:46,370
That's not what you said.

851
00:28:47,110 --> 00:28:49,810
- Give him 10 dollars.
- If I give away 20 dollars...

852
00:28:49,930 --> 00:28:50,930
Kwang Soo.

853
00:28:50,930 --> 00:28:52,200
(Kwang Soo hesitated,
but he pays 10 more dollars.)

854
00:28:52,680 --> 00:28:54,040
Grab him.

855
00:28:54,540 --> 00:28:56,080
We'll hold him,

856
00:28:56,110 --> 00:28:57,510
- and Tzuyu can eliminate him.
- She can.

857
00:28:57,510 --> 00:28:59,420
(We'll hold him,
and Tzuyu can eliminate him.)

858
00:28:59,650 --> 00:29:01,120
- She can.
- We won't rip yours.

859
00:29:01,120 --> 00:29:02,710
- Oh, gosh.
- Tzuyu, you can rip his name tag.

860
00:29:02,710 --> 00:29:03,890
- Hold on!
- Do it.

861
00:29:03,890 --> 00:29:05,280
- I'll give you money.
- Rip his name tag.

862
00:29:05,280 --> 00:29:06,480
- Tzuyu, rip it.
- Do it.

863
00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:08,180
- Rip it now.
- I'll give you 10 dollars.

864
00:29:08,180 --> 00:29:09,280
10 dollars.

865
00:29:09,660 --> 00:29:10,900
I'll give you 10 dollars, Tzuyu!

866
00:29:12,690 --> 00:29:13,690
Good.

867
00:29:13,690 --> 00:29:14,790
- We kept our promise.
- Okay.

868
00:29:14,790 --> 00:29:16,490
- I'll give you 10 dollars, Tzuyu!
- Good.

869
00:29:17,030 --> 00:29:18,840
(He justifies himself.)

870
00:29:18,840 --> 00:29:20,030
- Good.
- I'm sorry.

871
00:29:20,030 --> 00:29:21,200
We didn't rip yours.

872
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:22,500
- Good.
- Good job, Tzuyu.

873
00:29:22,500 --> 00:29:24,810
Go inside, you brat.

874
00:29:24,810 --> 00:29:25,810
You thought
you could convince us with money?

875
00:29:25,810 --> 00:29:28,700
- I didn't get swayed by 10 dollars.
- Let's go.

876
00:29:28,700 --> 00:29:31,150
Kwang Soo is out,
and his entire team is out.

877
00:29:31,150 --> 00:29:33,580
- Okay.
- What a messy game.

878
00:29:33,820 --> 00:29:35,820
- Right?
- We didn't die.

879
00:29:35,820 --> 00:29:36,820
This is great.

880
00:29:37,090 --> 00:29:38,160
Welcome.

881
00:29:39,780 --> 00:29:41,390
Our team was cool.

882
00:29:41,390 --> 00:29:44,630
We all got eliminated,
but you guys were the best.

883
00:29:44,900 --> 00:29:45,930
- We argued so much.
- Seriously.

884
00:29:45,930 --> 00:29:48,290
They're not disappointed
in you anymore.

885
00:29:48,290 --> 00:29:50,370
(He shows off.)

886
00:29:50,370 --> 00:29:52,100
Anyhow, I'm the captain.

887
00:29:52,170 --> 00:29:53,810
(While Kwang Soo shows off
about being a captain...)

888
00:29:53,810 --> 00:29:55,700
- Look at her.
- Thanks.

889
00:29:56,230 --> 00:29:59,200
I could give away money...

890
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:02,000
or keep all the money for myself.
We have a minus balance.

891
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:03,000
Okay.

892
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:04,940
Why did you give it away?

893
00:30:04,940 --> 00:30:07,090
Let me say this.
I have minus 200 dollars.

894
00:30:07,480 --> 00:30:08,620
I'm going to give it to one person.

895
00:30:09,680 --> 00:30:10,860
Let's give up.

896
00:30:11,980 --> 00:30:13,560
That's more terrifying.
"Let's give up."

897
00:30:13,560 --> 00:30:14,560
She's so cool about it.

898
00:30:14,560 --> 00:30:16,250
- You can't do it.
- They did a survey on their own.

899
00:30:16,250 --> 00:30:18,450
You got voted as the worst man
on Running Man.

900
00:30:18,450 --> 00:30:21,020
(Kwang Soo got voted
as the worst man on Running Man.)

901
00:30:21,290 --> 00:30:22,670
They think you look old.

902
00:30:22,790 --> 00:30:24,030
I do?

903
00:30:24,400 --> 00:30:25,570
I look old?

904
00:30:26,100 --> 00:30:27,810
Were you just gossiping?

905
00:30:28,140 --> 00:30:30,000
(Gossip on TV)

906
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:31,230
This is so funny.

907
00:30:31,380 --> 00:30:32,640
I don't see anybody.

908
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:34,000
We've been looking,
and we can't find anybody either.

909
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:35,880
They must be in the other building.

910
00:30:36,310 --> 00:30:37,350
Have a seat.

911
00:30:37,380 --> 00:30:40,240
We keep missing each other.
We haven't met anyone.

912
00:30:40,420 --> 00:30:43,710
Who's hoping to be the captain
on your team? Who wants to be it?

913
00:30:43,710 --> 00:30:45,750
We're rooting for Jihyo.

914
00:30:45,750 --> 00:30:47,780
- You planned it out.
- Jihyo?

915
00:30:47,780 --> 00:30:51,490
Yes, because she usually
takes the secretary role on TWICE.

916
00:30:51,490 --> 00:30:53,490
- I see.
- She's fair.

917
00:30:53,490 --> 00:30:54,490
(No, I'll do it.)

918
00:30:55,870 --> 00:30:57,640
Don't exchange glances.

919
00:30:57,900 --> 00:30:59,790
- What are you talking about?
- They're here.

920
00:30:59,790 --> 00:31:01,640
- It's Momo.
- There they are.

921
00:31:01,810 --> 00:31:04,730
Ji Hyo, this is a ceasefire.

922
00:31:04,770 --> 00:31:06,970
Ceasefire. Where's Se Chan?

923
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:08,540
- I'm over here.
- Oh, right.

924
00:31:08,540 --> 00:31:10,200
(Ripping)

925
00:31:10,970 --> 00:31:12,120
Hey.

926
00:31:12,120 --> 00:31:13,920
(Suk Jin ripped
Chaeyoung's name tag?)

927
00:31:14,940 --> 00:31:15,980
- Good job.
- Right?

928
00:31:15,980 --> 00:31:19,590
That was the most swift
you've been in 10 years.

929
00:31:19,780 --> 00:31:21,520
I played dumb. I stayed still.

930
00:31:21,520 --> 00:31:22,520
(Team Gray gains momentum.
Their next target is Team Purple.)

931
00:31:22,520 --> 00:31:23,930
I got her.

932
00:31:23,930 --> 00:31:25,790
- I did it. Okay.
- Okay.

933
00:31:25,790 --> 00:31:27,020
(Ji Hyo is out in an instant.)

934
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:28,930
My gosh. What now?

935
00:31:28,930 --> 00:31:30,020
Let's clean this up.

936
00:31:30,760 --> 00:31:31,900
We don't have an option.

937
00:31:31,900 --> 00:31:33,170
- Right?
- We have to attack.

938
00:31:33,170 --> 00:31:35,460
We don't have a choice.
We have to finish round one.

939
00:31:36,670 --> 00:31:38,200
(Shouting)

940
00:31:39,140 --> 00:31:41,180
(Se Chan fails to ambush.)

941
00:31:42,910 --> 00:31:44,540
(Help me, Jae Suk!)

942
00:31:44,540 --> 00:31:46,920
- My gosh.
- Come over here!

943
00:31:46,920 --> 00:31:48,710
- Hurry, Jihyo.
- Oh, dear.

944
00:31:48,710 --> 00:31:50,890
(Se Chan gets out of danger. What?)

945
00:31:51,890 --> 00:31:55,160
Hey! Jae Suk!

946
00:31:56,180 --> 00:31:58,400
(I can be the captain.)

947
00:31:58,400 --> 00:32:00,360
Come here.
I'll grab him, and you can rip his.

948
00:32:00,360 --> 00:32:01,570
- Do it.
- Hey.

949
00:32:01,570 --> 00:32:03,670
- Come here.
- Rip it.

950
00:32:03,900 --> 00:32:06,290
- Rip it.
- We did it.

951
00:32:06,290 --> 00:32:07,760
(Jae Suk is out!
Tzuyu is the captain of Team White.)

952
00:32:07,760 --> 00:32:10,200
- We did it.
- Hey. Tzuyu.

953
00:32:10,200 --> 00:32:11,380
- Mina first.
- He's out.

954
00:32:11,380 --> 00:32:12,730
Let's take care of her first.

955
00:32:12,770 --> 00:32:14,810
Come here. Mina first. Come inside.

956
00:32:15,770 --> 00:32:18,380
Come here.
Let's take care of her first.

957
00:32:18,380 --> 00:32:19,380
(What?)

958
00:32:19,380 --> 00:32:21,390
(Suk Jin eliminated Jong Kook?)

959
00:32:21,390 --> 00:32:25,010
My bad. I want to be the captain.

960
00:32:25,010 --> 00:32:27,060
I'm sorry. I'm sorry, Jong Kook.

961
00:32:27,590 --> 00:32:29,280
- I'm sorry, Jong Kook.
- Jihyo.

962
00:32:29,280 --> 00:32:30,450
We'll be in first place.

963
00:32:30,450 --> 00:32:31,930
- Girls.
- We will be.

964
00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:33,750
My bad.

965
00:32:33,750 --> 00:32:35,600
(With Jong Kook gone,
Suk Jin is the strongest.)

966
00:32:36,400 --> 00:32:38,400
(Mina is out.)

967
00:32:39,290 --> 00:32:41,910
- Okay, good job. Rip it.
- What's this?

968
00:32:41,910 --> 00:32:42,930
(Sana ripped it!)

969
00:32:42,930 --> 00:32:45,810
- Rip it.
- She's so tough.

970
00:32:46,410 --> 00:32:48,380
(At that moment,)

971
00:32:48,380 --> 00:32:50,620
(he attacks Sana.)

972
00:32:50,970 --> 00:32:53,770
My bad. I'm sorry. Wait. I'm sorry.

973
00:32:53,770 --> 00:32:55,180
I think this is a disease.

974
00:32:55,180 --> 00:32:57,390
(I'm sorry.
I think this is a disease.)

975
00:32:57,390 --> 00:33:00,680
I'm sorry.
Jihyo, you and I can dominate.

976
00:33:00,750 --> 00:33:03,160
- Let's go, Sana.
- You have to keep your promise.

977
00:33:03,160 --> 00:33:05,250
(Team Gray is the only team with
2 left. Their 1st target is Momo.)

978
00:33:05,830 --> 00:33:06,830
(Momo is out,
and Team Purple is in 3rd place.)

979
00:33:06,830 --> 00:33:09,170
- Jihyo! Jihyo!
- Okay.

980
00:33:09,170 --> 00:33:10,400
(They attack Tzuyu next,
who is their last target.)

981
00:33:10,790 --> 00:33:12,760
(Team White is in 2nd place.)

982
00:33:13,230 --> 00:33:14,930
- Tzuyu is out.
- Tzuyu is out.

983
00:33:14,930 --> 00:33:17,310
(The only people left are...)

984
00:33:17,310 --> 00:33:19,810
(Jihyo and me.)

985
00:33:21,410 --> 00:33:23,540
- I'm sorry.
- I shouldn't have trusted you.

986
00:33:23,540 --> 00:33:25,710
I'm sorry.

987
00:33:25,970 --> 00:33:27,540
Let's not make this messy.

988
00:33:28,280 --> 00:33:29,350
I'm sorry.

989
00:33:30,350 --> 00:33:32,620
(Jihyo is out.)

990
00:33:33,560 --> 00:33:36,630
Jihyo is out.
Suk Jin is the ultimate winner.

991
00:33:36,630 --> 00:33:37,990
(Team Gray wins.
Suk Jin is their captain.)

992
00:33:39,990 --> 00:33:44,100
Everybody, Cheer Up! Unexpected
Name Tag Elimination is over.

993
00:33:44,100 --> 00:33:46,490
Fourth place team is
Team Kwang Soo.

994
00:33:46,490 --> 00:33:47,730
- Team Kwang Soo.
- Last place.

995
00:33:47,730 --> 00:33:49,310
Their captain is Kwang Soo.

996
00:33:49,310 --> 00:33:50,610
- Yes!
- Sadly.

997
00:33:50,610 --> 00:33:52,610
- He's always like that.
- That team...

998
00:33:52,610 --> 00:33:54,580
is in the last place,
and they have the worst captain.

999
00:33:54,580 --> 00:33:55,880
He's deceitful.

1000
00:33:55,940 --> 00:33:58,180
- What are you talking about?
- He won't keep any.

1001
00:33:58,180 --> 00:33:59,920
He'll be in trouble.

1002
00:34:00,120 --> 00:34:03,180
Third place is Team Haha.
Their captain is Momo.

1003
00:34:03,180 --> 00:34:04,560
Momo.

1004
00:34:05,010 --> 00:34:06,750
I knew you'd be the captain.

1005
00:34:06,890 --> 00:34:10,060
She will distribute
minus 100 dollars.

1006
00:34:10,090 --> 00:34:12,900
Second place is Team Jae Suk.
Tzuyu is the captain.

1007
00:34:12,900 --> 00:34:13,890
- Okay.
- Captain Tzuyu.

1008
00:34:13,890 --> 00:34:15,000
- Good job.
- Good job.

1009
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:17,690
- Captain.
- First place is Team Suk Jin.

1010
00:34:17,770 --> 00:34:20,940
They have 500 dollars,
and Suk Jin is the captain.

1011
00:34:20,940 --> 00:34:22,040
(Team Gray's captain: Suk Jin,
obtained team money: 500 dollars)

1012
00:34:22,040 --> 00:34:23,310
Suk Jin is the captain.

1013
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:25,580
- This is going to be fun.
- Thank you.

1014
00:34:25,730 --> 00:34:27,370
- What's this?
- I'm looking forward to this.

1015
00:34:27,370 --> 00:34:29,770
Suk Jin is so good these days.

1016
00:34:29,770 --> 00:34:31,680
Please be understanding of me.

1017
00:34:31,680 --> 00:34:34,640
I think I have a disease.
Please be understanding.

1018
00:34:34,640 --> 00:34:37,620
That's all fine.
Just distribute the money fairly.

1019
00:34:37,620 --> 00:34:39,290
- Of course.
- Pay attention.

1020
00:34:39,290 --> 00:34:40,790
Of course.
I'll distribute it fairly.

1021
00:34:40,790 --> 00:34:44,100
We'll distribute the money now.

1022
00:34:44,190 --> 00:34:46,430
First place team,
Captain Suk Jin will go first.

1023
00:34:46,430 --> 00:34:47,890
- I'm looking forward to this.
- But...

1024
00:34:47,890 --> 00:34:49,790
- we picked a good captain.
- I agree.

1025
00:34:49,790 --> 00:34:51,940
If it were you or me,
it would have been bad.

1026
00:34:51,940 --> 00:34:54,310
It was part of my plan.

1027
00:34:54,310 --> 00:34:56,370
Will it be one-on-one later?

1028
00:34:56,500 --> 00:34:57,580
Yes.

1029
00:34:57,580 --> 00:34:58,830
Can we trust you?

1030
00:34:58,830 --> 00:35:02,270
We'll show you a board
with the amounts written down.

1031
00:35:02,270 --> 00:35:03,850
(Current Dollar Amounts)

1032
00:35:03,850 --> 00:35:05,520
How do you have 130 dollars?

1033
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:07,390
We're all around the same.

1034
00:35:07,390 --> 00:35:09,850
Suk Jin, keep 200
and give us 100 each.

1035
00:35:09,850 --> 00:35:11,290
Do the right thing.

1036
00:35:11,290 --> 00:35:13,750
- Right.
- Okay, I'm trying to.

1037
00:35:13,980 --> 00:35:16,660
- This is not hard.
- I didn't achieve this alone.

1038
00:35:16,660 --> 00:35:19,460
This is not a difficult decision
to make.

1039
00:35:19,460 --> 00:35:22,660
I know you don't do that. No way.

1040
00:35:22,660 --> 00:35:24,290
We might become the captain later.

1041
00:35:24,290 --> 00:35:25,500
Of course. I know.

1042
00:35:25,500 --> 00:35:27,500
Momo has a lot of money.

1043
00:35:27,500 --> 00:35:29,730
- This is not hard.
- Or...

1044
00:35:29,730 --> 00:35:32,600
make everybody 0. Deduct 10 from me,

1045
00:35:32,600 --> 00:35:34,810
deduct 20 from Mina,
and deduct 10 from Chaeyoung.

1046
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:36,410
There's 70 left then.

1047
00:35:36,410 --> 00:35:38,620
If you take that, you still have 30.

1048
00:35:38,620 --> 00:35:39,910
- You'll still be the captain.
- Is this a secret?

1049
00:35:39,910 --> 00:35:41,190
Yes, that sounds good.

1050
00:35:41,190 --> 00:35:42,620
- Isn't that good?
- Yes.

1051
00:35:42,620 --> 00:35:44,460
Isn't that really cool?

1052
00:35:44,460 --> 00:35:46,960
You'll be all over social media.

1053
00:35:48,020 --> 00:35:49,350
Because she's nice?

1054
00:35:49,890 --> 00:35:52,620
My gosh.

1055
00:35:52,620 --> 00:35:56,100
Think about it. Everybody will
have 0, and she'll have 30.

1056
00:35:56,100 --> 00:35:58,660
You'll still be the captain.
Please applaud.

1057
00:35:58,660 --> 00:35:59,660
(Please applaud.)

1058
00:36:00,290 --> 00:36:02,210
- That sounds great.
- Captains, please come on up.

1059
00:36:02,210 --> 00:36:04,230
We have no expectations
from Kwang Soo.

1060
00:36:04,410 --> 00:36:07,000
- We trust Captain Tzuyu.
- We trust you.

1061
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:09,580
Momo will be all over social media.

1062
00:36:09,750 --> 00:36:11,810
(However, Captain Suk Jin is
still hesitating.)

1063
00:36:11,810 --> 00:36:13,810
Do you need that much time to think?

1064
00:36:13,810 --> 00:36:15,290
- What?
- We already talked about this.

1065
00:36:15,290 --> 00:36:16,620
- You can't do this.
- I need to calculate this.

1066
00:36:16,620 --> 00:36:19,080
I want to calculate this...

1067
00:36:19,080 --> 00:36:20,690
so that you don't end up
in the last place.

1068
00:36:20,690 --> 00:36:23,620
If you don't do this properly,

1069
00:36:24,460 --> 00:36:26,430
Jong Kook will drive your car home.

1070
00:36:26,830 --> 00:36:29,690
Suk Jin, you live
in that apartment, right?

1071
00:36:29,690 --> 00:36:30,790
(Suk Jin, you live
in that apartment, right?)

1072
00:36:30,790 --> 00:36:32,190
He does. How did you know?

1073
00:36:32,190 --> 00:36:33,790
- My gosh.
- Of course I know.

1074
00:36:33,790 --> 00:36:36,000
I'm going to give him one for that.

1075
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:37,870
I'm going to give you one for that.

1076
00:36:38,100 --> 00:36:40,270
- Stop it.
- Hurry up.

1077
00:36:40,500 --> 00:36:42,480
Round one is over.

1078
00:36:42,480 --> 00:36:43,910
Please come up one by one.

1079
00:36:43,910 --> 00:36:45,310
(It's time to check
their individual amounts.)

1080
00:36:45,620 --> 00:36:47,790
(Captain Kwang Soo's Team Orange
goes first.)

1081
00:36:48,980 --> 00:36:51,080
She glared at him.
She glared at Kwang Soo.

1082
00:36:51,080 --> 00:36:52,390
She's mad.

1083
00:36:52,980 --> 00:36:55,230
- I knew he would take all.
- She glared at him.

1084
00:36:55,230 --> 00:36:57,060
- She glared at him.
- He probably turned her into zero.

1085
00:36:57,060 --> 00:36:58,120
(Avoiding her eyes)

1086
00:36:58,290 --> 00:37:00,660
Was it a lot?
I guess you lost a lot.

1087
00:37:00,660 --> 00:37:02,660
- This is just the beginning.
- Kwang Soo.

1088
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:04,890
She's criticizing him.

1089
00:37:05,290 --> 00:37:08,040
I'm really curious what Tzuyu did.

1090
00:37:08,040 --> 00:37:09,040
(Haha has minus 100,
and everybody else has 0.)

1091
00:37:09,040 --> 00:37:11,100
(He's flustered.)

1092
00:37:11,100 --> 00:37:13,100
What's this?

1093
00:37:13,100 --> 00:37:14,770
(I'm the only one
who has minus 100?)

1094
00:37:15,580 --> 00:37:17,710
Darn it.

1095
00:37:17,770 --> 00:37:19,180
(She avoids his eyes.)

1096
00:37:19,180 --> 00:37:21,020
- Laugh and get over it.
- This is one-on-one.

1097
00:37:21,020 --> 00:37:22,120
- We're barely starting.
- Laugh.

1098
00:37:22,120 --> 00:37:23,890
Laugh.

1099
00:37:23,890 --> 00:37:25,190
That was wild.

1100
00:37:25,190 --> 00:37:26,620
Right?

1101
00:37:26,690 --> 00:37:27,690
Okay.

1102
00:37:28,290 --> 00:37:29,290
Loyalty.

1103
00:37:29,750 --> 00:37:30,890
(Se Chan has 30,
and everybody else has 90.)

1104
00:37:30,890 --> 00:37:33,190
What? That's all she gave me?

1105
00:37:33,190 --> 00:37:34,390
(Result according to
Captain Tzuyu's distribution)

1106
00:37:34,390 --> 00:37:35,730
(That's all she gave me?)

1107
00:37:36,290 --> 00:37:37,790
(Tzuyu?)

1108
00:37:37,790 --> 00:37:39,390
- That's all you gave me?
- You still got some.

1109
00:37:39,390 --> 00:37:40,460
You still have some money.

1110
00:37:40,460 --> 00:37:41,910
That's still a lot.

1111
00:37:41,910 --> 00:37:43,730
- It's a lot.
- Okay.

1112
00:37:43,770 --> 00:37:45,180
I'm satisfied.

1113
00:37:45,180 --> 00:37:46,310
Great job, Tzuyu.

1114
00:37:46,310 --> 00:37:47,310
- Tzuyu.
- I knew it.

1115
00:37:47,310 --> 00:37:49,600
I like Captain Tzuyu.

1116
00:37:49,600 --> 00:37:50,600
Next team.

1117
00:37:50,600 --> 00:37:51,710
(This is the result according to
Captain Suk Jin's distribution.)

1118
00:37:52,180 --> 00:37:54,040
(Suk Jin has 290,
and everybody else has 70.)

1119
00:37:54,040 --> 00:37:55,310
He gave us some.

1120
00:37:55,310 --> 00:37:57,750
- It's tricky.
- But he gave us more...

1121
00:37:57,750 --> 00:37:59,560
than I thought.

1122
00:37:59,560 --> 00:38:00,690
(Rankings After Distribution)

1123
00:38:00,690 --> 00:38:02,830
(So Min, Jeongyeon, and Haha
will be receiving penalties.)

1124
00:38:03,080 --> 00:38:05,850
We'll pick captains...

1125
00:38:05,850 --> 00:38:07,500
- for round two.
- What?

1126
00:38:07,500 --> 00:38:09,060
Here are the rules.

1127
00:38:09,060 --> 00:38:11,690
Each of you can bet
as much money as you want...

1128
00:38:11,690 --> 00:38:14,410
within the amount you own in secret.

1129
00:38:14,660 --> 00:38:16,940
And we will reveal the money
you bet all at the same time.

1130
00:38:16,940 --> 00:38:19,730
Those with the largest bet
will be the second captains.

1131
00:38:19,730 --> 00:38:21,440
What if we have a negative balance?

1132
00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:24,910
If you have a negative balance
or no money to bet,

1133
00:38:25,270 --> 00:38:27,750
we offer the loan service...

1134
00:38:27,750 --> 00:38:30,120
- called Running Man Surety System.
- We have a loan system?

1135
00:38:30,190 --> 00:38:32,350
- By how much?
- Regardless of your team,

1136
00:38:32,350 --> 00:38:35,660
you can get a loan from
the production crew with one surety.

1137
00:38:35,660 --> 00:38:38,100
You can get 200 dollars per surety.

1138
00:38:38,100 --> 00:38:39,690
(They can get a loan of 200 dollars
per surety regardless of teams.)

1139
00:38:39,690 --> 00:38:41,020
When the race is over,

1140
00:38:41,020 --> 00:38:43,560
if the debtors pay their debts,

1141
00:38:43,560 --> 00:38:45,790
the sureties also get
the interest of 50 dollars.

1142
00:38:46,640 --> 00:38:48,910
- That's nice.
- If the debtors don't pay it back,

1143
00:38:48,910 --> 00:38:50,560
the sureties will have to
settle the debt.

1144
00:38:50,560 --> 00:38:52,810
- That's not good.
- Who would stand surety then?

1145
00:38:52,810 --> 00:38:54,310
- I'd never do that.
- We can't trust anyone.

1146
00:38:54,310 --> 00:38:56,140
No matter what happens,

1147
00:38:56,140 --> 00:38:57,370
you should never stand surety.

1148
00:38:57,370 --> 00:38:59,680
I never stand surety no matter what.

1149
00:38:59,680 --> 00:39:01,350
I can lend my own money,

1150
00:39:01,350 --> 00:39:02,440
but I can't stand surety.

1151
00:39:02,480 --> 00:39:04,310
- You know how much you have, right?
- Yes.

1152
00:39:04,310 --> 00:39:06,850
Now you will make a bet.
Does anyone of you need a loan?

1153
00:39:07,930 --> 00:39:09,690
Name your surety.

1154
00:39:09,980 --> 00:39:11,330
Chairman Jee, please help me.

1155
00:39:12,960 --> 00:39:14,270
What are you doing?

1156
00:39:14,270 --> 00:39:16,190
(Haha goes to Chairman Ji ranked
number 1 in financial circles.)

1157
00:39:16,190 --> 00:39:17,770
- Please guarantee my debt.
- How much do you need?

1158
00:39:17,770 --> 00:39:20,040
- That's what matters.
- Momo now has 100 dollars.

1159
00:39:20,160 --> 00:39:22,210
You get a loan of 200 dollars
in all cases.

1160
00:39:22,310 --> 00:39:23,460
- It's 200 dollars.
- 200 dollars?

1161
00:39:23,460 --> 00:39:26,080
Gosh, that's a lot of money.

1162
00:39:26,140 --> 00:39:28,270
If the amount is too high,

1163
00:39:28,270 --> 00:39:29,870
we can make it 100 dollars
with the interest of 30 dollars.

1164
00:39:29,870 --> 00:39:31,350
Okay. 100 dollars sounds better.

1165
00:39:31,440 --> 00:39:33,080
- I need 200 dollars though.
- Why?

1166
00:39:33,080 --> 00:39:35,440
I need to beat Momo.

1167
00:39:35,790 --> 00:39:37,750
- Just trust me this once.
- How much does she have?

1168
00:39:37,750 --> 00:39:39,790
- I've been with you for 10 years.
- How much does Momo have?

1169
00:39:39,790 --> 00:39:41,460
- She has 100 dollars.
- I'm sure...

1170
00:39:41,460 --> 00:39:43,430
he will definitely pay his debt.
I know what he's like.

1171
00:39:43,830 --> 00:39:45,350
I'll do this right.
Just trust me this once.

1172
00:39:45,460 --> 00:39:47,250
- Okay! I can do this.
- Okay!

1173
00:39:47,250 --> 00:39:49,330
All right. I'll stand
surety for Haha.

1174
00:39:49,430 --> 00:39:51,790
- You're like my brother.
- You're so generous.

1175
00:39:51,790 --> 00:39:53,270
I'll stand surety for him.
It's 200 dollars.

1176
00:39:53,270 --> 00:39:54,910
- Thank you so much.
- You need 200 dollars.

1177
00:39:54,910 --> 00:39:56,370
- Thank you, Suk Jin.
- All right.

1178
00:39:56,770 --> 00:39:58,730
(He gets the surety name tag.)

1179
00:39:59,140 --> 00:40:00,810
Let's do this. Okay.

1180
00:40:00,810 --> 00:40:01,940
I have to do this right.

1181
00:40:01,940 --> 00:40:02,940
(Who will be the captain
of Team Purple?)

1182
00:40:03,640 --> 00:40:04,750
- Se Chan.
- Yes?

1183
00:40:04,940 --> 00:40:06,750
- Can I get some money?
- What?

1184
00:40:06,750 --> 00:40:07,850
I need some money.

1185
00:40:07,850 --> 00:40:09,910
I'll send 200 dollars
to your account now.

1186
00:40:09,910 --> 00:40:11,290
(They can exchange money for real?)

1187
00:40:11,290 --> 00:40:13,390
Kwang Soo, you're not
supposed to do this.

1188
00:40:13,560 --> 00:40:15,230
Why would you send money
to my account?

1189
00:40:15,230 --> 00:40:16,560
- Real money?
- He says he'll send me real money.

1190
00:40:16,560 --> 00:40:17,890
Send me your account number.

1191
00:40:17,890 --> 00:40:20,750
Listen, Se Chan. I'm sure I can win.

1192
00:40:20,750 --> 00:40:22,660
- Hang on.
- On the name of TWICE.

1193
00:40:22,770 --> 00:40:24,790
- Are you serious?
- Yes.

1194
00:40:24,790 --> 00:40:26,040
I swear.

1195
00:40:26,040 --> 00:40:27,390
- You swear on the name of TWICE?
- Yes.

1196
00:40:27,390 --> 00:40:29,770
(Why is she so serious
about no big deal like this?)

1197
00:40:29,830 --> 00:40:31,140
I'll stand surety for Nayeon.

1198
00:40:31,830 --> 00:40:33,940
- You're standing surety for her?
- Yes, I'm the guarantor.

1199
00:40:34,410 --> 00:40:36,180
She possessed me to do this.

1200
00:40:36,270 --> 00:40:37,710
- Are you sure?
- Yes.

1201
00:40:38,250 --> 00:40:40,680
Se Chan. Can you stand
surety for me too?

1202
00:40:40,680 --> 00:40:41,850
I have no money.

1203
00:40:41,850 --> 00:40:43,390
- Se Chan.
- It's over.

1204
00:40:43,390 --> 00:40:44,410
Se Chan, please.

1205
00:40:44,520 --> 00:40:45,750
What did she say?

1206
00:40:45,750 --> 00:40:47,160
- Aren't you two friends?
- We're friends.

1207
00:40:47,190 --> 00:40:49,160
She's even a few months
older than me.

1208
00:40:49,230 --> 00:40:50,350
Is she crazy?

1209
00:40:50,520 --> 00:40:52,430
- Go find someone else.
- What are you talking about?

1210
00:40:52,430 --> 00:40:53,930
Go ask Suk Jin.

1211
00:40:53,930 --> 00:40:55,560
This is a mess.

1212
00:40:55,560 --> 00:40:56,890
(While everyone is busy
standing surety...)

1213
00:40:58,330 --> 00:41:00,370
- You're the captain, Momo.
- Can I get a loan?

1214
00:41:00,370 --> 00:41:02,540
- You're the captain now.
- I have to be the captain again.

1215
00:41:02,540 --> 00:41:04,710
Otherwise, Haha will be
the new captain.

1216
00:41:04,980 --> 00:41:06,330
Hold on, Momo.

1217
00:41:06,330 --> 00:41:08,410
(He just can't believe
what's happening.)

1218
00:41:08,410 --> 00:41:10,480
Is Momo talking to Jong Kook now?

1219
00:41:10,640 --> 00:41:11,770
- My gosh.
- Hey.

1220
00:41:12,180 --> 00:41:14,640
I thought they were having
a private talk.

1221
00:41:14,640 --> 00:41:15,940
You're the captain now.

1222
00:41:15,940 --> 00:41:17,250
I see. You want to be the captain?

1223
00:41:18,160 --> 00:41:20,560
I think he will bet a lot of money.

1224
00:41:20,560 --> 00:41:21,790
I need a loan.

1225
00:41:21,790 --> 00:41:22,980
Momo.

1226
00:41:22,980 --> 00:41:25,600
- Why would you...
- You've got 30 seconds left.

1227
00:41:25,600 --> 00:41:26,660
(Hesitating)

1228
00:41:27,020 --> 00:41:28,500
Do you really have to do this?

1229
00:41:28,690 --> 00:41:29,930
This is crazy. Hold on.

1230
00:41:30,020 --> 00:41:31,370
It's driving me crazy.

1231
00:41:31,560 --> 00:41:32,940
Why are you coming out?

1232
00:41:33,560 --> 00:41:34,960
Have you lost your mind?

1233
00:41:35,330 --> 00:41:36,710
- Jong Kook.
- Hey.

1234
00:41:36,710 --> 00:41:38,580
- My gosh.
- Are you standing surety for Momo?

1235
00:41:38,580 --> 00:41:40,440
I was told not to stand
surety no matter what.

1236
00:41:40,540 --> 00:41:41,910
You shouldn't do this.

1237
00:41:41,910 --> 00:41:43,100
You can't do it.

1238
00:41:43,680 --> 00:41:46,020
Is this what Momo
is up to? All right.

1239
00:41:47,040 --> 00:41:48,480
- Chairman Jee.
- How much do you have?

1240
00:41:48,480 --> 00:41:49,640
I'm asking you for the last time.

1241
00:41:49,640 --> 00:41:51,790
Suk Jin, we're in the same team.

1242
00:41:51,790 --> 00:41:53,410
It means one of us will be doomed.

1243
00:41:53,410 --> 00:41:55,080
- If we keep doing this, she will...
- We can't do this.

1244
00:41:55,080 --> 00:41:57,080
- Right.
- Are you here to stand surety?

1245
00:41:57,120 --> 00:41:59,500
- No, I'm still thinking about it.
- I can't believe you're doing this.

1246
00:41:59,500 --> 00:42:01,460
If you want to do this,
you can stand surety for me.

1247
00:42:01,460 --> 00:42:02,560
My gosh.

1248
00:42:03,190 --> 00:42:04,890
You were talking to Se Chan.

1249
00:42:04,890 --> 00:42:07,000
- She's got a lot of money.
- She does?

1250
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:08,330
- That's not true.
- Hang on.

1251
00:42:08,330 --> 00:42:09,730
My goodness.

1252
00:42:09,910 --> 00:42:12,330
- Look at Momo. Look at her eyes.
- Momo.

1253
00:42:12,330 --> 00:42:13,640
Momo. All right then.

1254
00:42:13,640 --> 00:42:15,640
- I'll do it for her.
- Thank you.

1255
00:42:15,640 --> 00:42:17,750
Of course I should do this for Momo.

1256
00:42:19,270 --> 00:42:20,540
My gosh.

1257
00:42:20,770 --> 00:42:22,480
- Did you just stand surety for her?
- Chairman Jee!

1258
00:42:22,480 --> 00:42:24,710
I should never
let my mom watch this.

1259
00:42:26,210 --> 00:42:28,060
Wait. Listen.

1260
00:42:28,060 --> 00:42:29,850
Kwang Soo will stand surety for me.

1261
00:42:30,020 --> 00:42:31,830
Kwang Soo will stand surety for me.

1262
00:42:31,830 --> 00:42:33,520
- Is it true, Kwang Soo?
- What?

1263
00:42:33,660 --> 00:42:34,830
What about me?

1264
00:42:34,830 --> 00:42:38,000
So Min just got 200 dollars
with Kwang Soo as the surety.

1265
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:39,270
I'm standing surety for So Min?

1266
00:42:39,270 --> 00:42:41,040
- What nonsense is this?
- Stand surety for each other.

1267
00:42:41,040 --> 00:42:43,460
- I'm trying to borrow money here.
- No, Kwang Soo.

1268
00:42:43,730 --> 00:42:46,140
- I'm looking for a surety now.
- Just come here.

1269
00:42:46,210 --> 00:42:47,480
- Why would I...
- Are you crazy, Kwang Soo?

1270
00:42:47,480 --> 00:42:48,770
- It's not like that.
- Are you insane?

1271
00:42:48,770 --> 00:42:49,980
- Listen to me.
- Why would I do that?

1272
00:42:49,980 --> 00:42:52,080
Just stand surety for me.

1273
00:42:52,080 --> 00:42:53,270
I won't bet my money
to become the captain.

1274
00:42:53,270 --> 00:42:55,980
Once I pay the money back,
you'll make 50 dollars.

1275
00:42:56,710 --> 00:42:57,910
Or I can get a loan of 100 dollars.

1276
00:42:58,620 --> 00:43:00,710
Round One is over. Please sit down.

1277
00:43:00,710 --> 00:43:02,520
Wait. He said yes.

1278
00:43:02,620 --> 00:43:04,960
I'll leave my phone with you.

1279
00:43:05,560 --> 00:43:06,750
I don't need your phone.

1280
00:43:06,750 --> 00:43:08,020
Just get me 100 dollars.

1281
00:43:08,830 --> 00:43:11,000
Okay. I'll do it for you, So Min.

1282
00:43:11,100 --> 00:43:12,830
Just get 100 dollars.
Only 100 dollars.

1283
00:43:12,830 --> 00:43:14,290
I'll try my best.

1284
00:43:14,540 --> 00:43:15,910
I'll be good.

1285
00:43:16,100 --> 00:43:18,640
Everyone, now you should make a bet.

1286
00:43:18,770 --> 00:43:23,000
Those with the largest bet will be
the captain using the money.

1287
00:43:23,100 --> 00:43:26,080
The rest of you will
get your money back.

1288
00:43:26,370 --> 00:43:27,810
- We get the money back?
- Yes.

1289
00:43:27,810 --> 00:43:29,290
If you bet a large amount of money,

1290
00:43:29,290 --> 00:43:31,480
the captain will have to
spend more money.

1291
00:43:31,750 --> 00:43:33,520
That's right.
You should think about it.

1292
00:43:33,810 --> 00:43:35,230
You won't bet your money anyway.

1293
00:43:35,690 --> 00:43:37,230
I need to become the captain now.

1294
00:43:38,290 --> 00:43:39,620
Let me be honest with you.

1295
00:43:40,160 --> 00:43:42,290
I love my team members.

1296
00:43:42,290 --> 00:43:45,160
(Let me be honest with you.
I love my team members.)

1297
00:43:46,660 --> 00:43:48,330
I'll take good care of you guys.

1298
00:43:48,330 --> 00:43:50,330
Just stay out of this.

1299
00:43:50,330 --> 00:43:52,830
I'll make you get your money back
by being in second place, at least.

1300
00:43:53,230 --> 00:43:55,370
- Are you serious?
- I'll be the captain.

1301
00:43:55,580 --> 00:43:58,140
- Nayeon, you have to be a captain.
- Sure.

1302
00:43:58,350 --> 00:43:59,810
I'm smart. Don't worry, Se Chan.

1303
00:43:59,810 --> 00:44:01,140
I'll pay your money back.

1304
00:44:01,140 --> 00:44:02,190
Really? Thank you.

1305
00:44:02,190 --> 00:44:04,040
Even if I fail, I'll pay
your money back anyway.

1306
00:44:04,040 --> 00:44:05,750
But Jihyo doesn't agree.

1307
00:44:05,750 --> 00:44:07,080
Are you serious? Okay.

1308
00:44:08,020 --> 00:44:09,690
- Okay.
- Nayeon sings the first part.

1309
00:44:09,690 --> 00:44:12,850
And the lyrics go like this. "I'm
not going to please you anymore."

1310
00:44:13,120 --> 00:44:15,330
- Seriously?
- Dahyun, you're amazing.

1311
00:44:15,930 --> 00:44:18,040
Is that the lyrics you sing?

1312
00:44:18,540 --> 00:44:20,640
(I'm not going
to please you anymore.)

1313
00:44:20,640 --> 00:44:22,500
Even if I fail, I'll pay
your money back anyway.

1314
00:44:22,730 --> 00:44:24,460
Is that the lyrics you sing?

1315
00:44:24,460 --> 00:44:26,410
(The surety is worried
because of the lyrics now.)

1316
00:44:26,540 --> 00:44:27,980
- Let me announce the results.
- Okay.

1317
00:44:28,440 --> 00:44:30,480
First, Team White.

1318
00:44:30,770 --> 00:44:31,910
Who is it?

1319
00:44:32,410 --> 00:44:33,910
The captain for Round Two is...

1320
00:44:33,910 --> 00:44:35,310
(Who's the captain of Team White?)

1321
00:44:35,310 --> 00:44:36,810
Yoo Jae Suk who bet 10 dollars.

1322
00:44:36,810 --> 00:44:38,080
(Yoo Jae Suk who bet 10 dollars)

1323
00:44:38,080 --> 00:44:40,020
We helped him become the captain.

1324
00:44:40,020 --> 00:44:41,290
Did you not stop him?

1325
00:44:41,520 --> 00:44:44,330
It's amazing that he became
the captain only with 10 dollars.

1326
00:44:44,330 --> 00:44:45,660
- It's the best, right?
- It is.

1327
00:44:45,660 --> 00:44:47,160
- He's so lucky.
- This is easy.

1328
00:44:47,160 --> 00:44:49,270
All right. The captain
of Team Gray is...

1329
00:44:49,730 --> 00:44:51,540
Ji Suk Jin who bet 110 dollars.

1330
00:44:51,540 --> 00:44:53,540
You said you didn't bet much money.

1331
00:44:53,540 --> 00:44:55,770
Jihyo bet 50 dollars,
and Sana bet 30 dollars.

1332
00:44:55,770 --> 00:44:56,940
Jong Kook didn't bet his money.

1333
00:44:57,810 --> 00:44:58,980
How much?

1334
00:44:59,100 --> 00:45:00,980
- Did you not bet your money?
- No.

1335
00:45:00,980 --> 00:45:03,000
- You needed only 50 dollars.
- I think...

1336
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:04,580
- he will get a penalty today.
- No. The thing is...

1337
00:45:04,580 --> 00:45:06,210
they have about 100 dollars.

1338
00:45:06,210 --> 00:45:07,370
Chairman Jee.

1339
00:45:07,370 --> 00:45:09,140
I'll pay your money
back immediately.

1340
00:45:09,140 --> 00:45:11,250
- Okay.
- All right. Team Purple.

1341
00:45:11,250 --> 00:45:13,560
(The result of Team Purple
is announced.)

1342
00:45:13,560 --> 00:45:17,660
(Momo and Haha got loans
to become the new captain.)

1343
00:45:17,660 --> 00:45:19,000
(How did it go?)

1344
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:20,620
Momo who bet 220 dollars
is the captain.

1345
00:45:20,620 --> 00:45:23,870
(Momo who bet 220 dollars
is the captain.)

1346
00:45:23,870 --> 00:45:26,870
(This is why I use money.)

1347
00:45:26,940 --> 00:45:27,960
But...

1348
00:45:28,310 --> 00:45:30,140
Haha didn't bet his money.

1349
00:45:30,140 --> 00:45:32,640
(Haha didn't bet his money.)

1350
00:45:33,180 --> 00:45:34,410
Haha didn't bet his money.

1351
00:45:34,410 --> 00:45:36,680
(Haha made Momo spend a lot of
money to become the next captain.)

1352
00:45:36,680 --> 00:45:38,440
- He's so mean.
- He's so...

1353
00:45:38,440 --> 00:45:39,770
- He's really nasty.
- Haha!

1354
00:45:40,270 --> 00:45:42,190
- Next round.
- Help me in the next round.

1355
00:45:42,190 --> 00:45:43,980
She spent 220 dollars
to become the captain?

1356
00:45:44,620 --> 00:45:47,210
- This is unbelievable.
- It's too expensive.

1357
00:45:47,210 --> 00:45:48,580
She spent a lot.

1358
00:45:48,580 --> 00:45:51,430
- Momo has to win.
- 220 dollars to become the captain.

1359
00:45:51,430 --> 00:45:52,750
Team Orange.

1360
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:55,160
- I'm curious about this team.
- Nayeon should be the captain.

1361
00:45:55,290 --> 00:45:56,390
Nayeon who bet 20 dollars
is the captain.

1362
00:45:56,390 --> 00:45:57,390
Yes!

1363
00:45:57,460 --> 00:45:58,690
(Nayeon who bet 20 dollars)

1364
00:45:58,690 --> 00:45:59,730
(The surety is happy.)

1365
00:45:59,730 --> 00:46:01,660
Kwang Soo bet 10 dollars,
and the rest of them didn't bet.

1366
00:46:01,870 --> 00:46:03,410
- Why did you not make a bet?
- So Min, why did you not do it?

1367
00:46:03,410 --> 00:46:04,680
- Why did you not make a bet?
- You got a loan.

1368
00:46:04,680 --> 00:46:06,770
I just got a loan to keep the money.

1369
00:46:06,770 --> 00:46:09,140
(Having cash is the best.)

1370
00:46:09,140 --> 00:46:10,210
(What?)

1371
00:46:10,210 --> 00:46:11,370
What is she up to?

1372
00:46:12,180 --> 00:46:14,270
Hey, what you're doing is...

1373
00:46:14,270 --> 00:46:15,690
- like getting a loan for saving.
- But once I...

1374
00:46:15,690 --> 00:46:17,480
Once I pay the money back,
you'll get the interest.

1375
00:46:17,480 --> 00:46:19,190
Why would you get a loan
and save it up?

1376
00:46:19,190 --> 00:46:21,520
- This isn't about the game.
- What are you doing?

1377
00:46:21,520 --> 00:46:23,480
She's making money in her own way.

1378
00:46:23,560 --> 00:46:24,790
I don't want to lose.

1379
00:46:25,330 --> 00:46:26,520
This is Round Two.

1380
00:46:26,660 --> 00:46:30,270
This round is for differential
prize money and lunch menu.

1381
00:46:30,790 --> 00:46:32,730
The second mission is
Graceful Signal Dance.

1382
00:46:33,640 --> 00:46:35,270
Momo has to try hard in this round.

1383
00:46:35,270 --> 00:46:36,870
She has to win.

1384
00:46:36,940 --> 00:46:38,330
I have to try hard.

1385
00:46:38,940 --> 00:46:40,600
- You must be hungry now.
- Right.

1386
00:46:40,870 --> 00:46:42,870
So we prepared lunch for you.

1387
00:46:42,870 --> 00:46:45,180
You'll hear various signal songs.

1388
00:46:45,250 --> 00:46:46,850
Listen to the songs carefully...

1389
00:46:46,850 --> 00:46:49,850
and show dance moves
that are suitable for them.

1390
00:46:50,310 --> 00:46:52,660
You can give it a try
in any order you like.

1391
00:46:52,750 --> 00:46:56,620
Once you're done dancing,
the three judges will...

1392
00:46:56,620 --> 00:46:59,830
lift up the color
of the best dancer.

1393
00:47:00,330 --> 00:47:02,770
If you get one or more votes,

1394
00:47:02,770 --> 00:47:04,660
- you can get the menu for lunch.
- Okay.

1395
00:47:04,690 --> 00:47:05,770
We have an advantage here.

1396
00:47:05,770 --> 00:47:07,600
And you will get differential rates
of prize money...

1397
00:47:07,600 --> 00:47:09,440
according to the number
of dishes you win.

1398
00:47:09,440 --> 00:47:10,640
- Let's do this.
- Let me play...

1399
00:47:10,640 --> 00:47:11,870
- the first song then.
- Shall we dance together?

1400
00:47:11,940 --> 00:47:13,500
- We should try hard.
- Cue.

1401
00:47:13,500 --> 00:47:15,410
(The first song)

1402
00:47:15,410 --> 00:47:16,640
(A combination of trot and EDM,
"Amor Fati")

1403
00:47:16,640 --> 00:47:17,940
Go ahead and dance.

1404
00:47:17,980 --> 00:47:19,410
(Dahyun of Team White steps up.)

1405
00:47:19,410 --> 00:47:21,040
- She's doing it.
- You can do this by yourself.

1406
00:47:21,040 --> 00:47:22,810
- Dance with your guts.
- You can do this.

1407
00:47:22,810 --> 00:47:24,080
(The random dance machine
of TWICE, Dahyun goes first.)

1408
00:47:26,060 --> 00:47:27,310
Good, Dahyun.

1409
00:47:27,710 --> 00:47:28,890
- Chaeyoung.
- Go.

1410
00:47:28,890 --> 00:47:30,060
Good job, Chaeyoung.

1411
00:47:30,560 --> 00:47:32,290
Mina, that's good.

1412
00:47:32,750 --> 00:47:34,290
Dahyun's face is so funny.

1413
00:47:34,620 --> 00:47:35,690
(She's the master
of facial expressions.)

1414
00:47:35,690 --> 00:47:37,620
She makes the same expression,
but she looks different.

1415
00:47:38,160 --> 00:47:39,790
Momo, you should show something.

1416
00:47:39,790 --> 00:47:41,000
Show us.

1417
00:47:42,210 --> 00:47:43,830
How would we beat her?

1418
00:47:44,100 --> 00:47:45,480
Good.

1419
00:47:45,480 --> 00:47:46,730
It's so cool.

1420
00:47:46,730 --> 00:47:48,980
(Momo joins them dancing poppin.)

1421
00:47:50,180 --> 00:47:51,250
Great.

1422
00:47:51,250 --> 00:47:53,410
(The battle for the center
has begun.)

1423
00:47:53,410 --> 00:47:54,540
That's nice.

1424
00:47:54,850 --> 00:47:56,810
They are fighting.

1425
00:47:56,810 --> 00:47:58,290
That's really good.

1426
00:47:58,290 --> 00:48:00,290
(She expresses
how she lost her confidence.)

1427
00:48:00,290 --> 00:48:02,190
Why would she dance like that
to a song like this?

1428
00:48:02,480 --> 00:48:03,750
Momo, that's great.

1429
00:48:04,020 --> 00:48:05,350
I love it.

1430
00:48:06,460 --> 00:48:07,560
Okay.

1431
00:48:07,560 --> 00:48:08,660
(The first song is over
after the battle for the center.)

1432
00:48:08,730 --> 00:48:11,540
When Dahyun takes the stage,
I can't go out there.

1433
00:48:11,960 --> 00:48:13,660
She has that air about her.

1434
00:48:13,660 --> 00:48:14,910
Dahyun is too strong.

1435
00:48:14,910 --> 00:48:16,040
She is too scary.

1436
00:48:16,330 --> 00:48:17,410
I am afraid of her.

1437
00:48:17,410 --> 00:48:21,000
Raise the color of the team
whose dance you liked the most.

1438
00:48:31,230 --> 00:48:32,360
(Will it be Momo who is
desperate for high scores...)

1439
00:48:32,360 --> 00:48:33,530
(or Dahyun who has
a variety of facial expressions?)

1440
00:48:33,530 --> 00:48:34,530
Three.

1441
00:48:34,960 --> 00:48:37,030
(They voted unanimously
for Team White.)

1442
00:48:37,030 --> 00:48:38,130
- Okay!
- Yes!

1443
00:48:38,130 --> 00:48:39,530
It's okay.

1444
00:48:39,530 --> 00:48:41,500
- Dahyun, you did it.
- You did it.

1445
00:48:41,500 --> 00:48:43,000
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

1446
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:44,050
Thank you.

1447
00:48:44,550 --> 00:48:45,610
Good job.

1448
00:48:45,610 --> 00:48:49,050
The second signal song is
for bulgogi and mushroom hot pot.

1449
00:48:49,050 --> 00:48:50,280
That's all we need.

1450
00:48:50,590 --> 00:48:52,460
Music, cue.

1451
00:48:52,460 --> 00:48:54,420
(The song begins.)

1452
00:48:54,650 --> 00:48:56,130
Hold on. Isn't that the song?

1453
00:48:56,130 --> 00:48:57,460
(Hold on. This song is...)

1454
00:48:57,460 --> 00:48:58,750
(Haha and Jae Suk
react automatically.)

1455
00:48:58,750 --> 00:48:59,860
"Infinite Challenge".

1456
00:49:00,190 --> 00:49:01,190
My goodness.

1457
00:49:01,190 --> 00:49:02,530
Isn't this a song
for "Infinite Challenge"?

1458
00:49:02,530 --> 00:49:04,670
(They heard this song a lot
in their "Infinite Challenge" days.)

1459
00:49:05,360 --> 00:49:08,030
(Their teamwork on Saturdays
became a fond memory.)

1460
00:49:08,030 --> 00:49:10,230
"Infinite Challenge"!

1461
00:49:10,730 --> 00:49:12,610
(The former members party
as if their time has come.)

1462
00:49:12,610 --> 00:49:14,380
There you go. There you go.

1463
00:49:14,750 --> 00:49:17,280
This song is for Jae Suk and Haha.

1464
00:49:18,840 --> 00:49:20,480
How could you play this song?

1465
00:49:21,020 --> 00:49:23,050
(She is more excited
than the former members.)

1466
00:49:23,480 --> 00:49:26,880
- Haha and Jae Suk will take it.
- There you go, Sana.

1467
00:49:26,880 --> 00:49:27,880
(Sana and Suk Jin are dancing
like an old couple.)

1468
00:49:27,880 --> 00:49:29,420
There you go, Sana.

1469
00:49:30,050 --> 00:49:33,530
(The "Infinite Challenge" song sends
the ballroom into chaos.)

1470
00:49:33,530 --> 00:49:35,530
- The dance needs to suit the song.
- That was great.

1471
00:49:35,530 --> 00:49:36,590
Our team will win.

1472
00:49:36,590 --> 00:49:39,130
- Haha and Jae Suk.
- I haven't done this dance.

1473
00:49:39,360 --> 00:49:40,940
I haven't done this dance.

1474
00:49:41,170 --> 00:49:43,900
The round was
for bulgogi and mushroom hot pot.

1475
00:49:43,940 --> 00:49:45,630
It was a song
for "Infinite Challenge".

1476
00:49:45,630 --> 00:49:47,880
1, 2, 3.

1477
00:49:48,550 --> 00:49:49,610
Okay.

1478
00:49:49,610 --> 00:49:52,320
(Team Gray and Team White
get the dish!)

1479
00:49:53,480 --> 00:49:55,420
(You should have danced better.)

1480
00:49:55,420 --> 00:49:56,840
Good job.

1481
00:49:56,840 --> 00:49:59,280
- Haha danced with Jae Suk.
- He danced too.

1482
00:49:59,280 --> 00:50:00,460
Didn't he get a vote?

1483
00:50:00,590 --> 00:50:02,150
Haha danced too.

1484
00:50:02,150 --> 00:50:04,820
Is this because I am not
on "Hangout with Yoo"?

1485
00:50:04,820 --> 00:50:06,250
Haha danced too.

1486
00:50:06,250 --> 00:50:08,170
(He is on a variety show
on both days of the weekend.)

1487
00:50:08,170 --> 00:50:11,130
- Okay.
- The decision is objective.

1488
00:50:11,630 --> 00:50:13,500
This one is for the rolled omelet.

1489
00:50:13,500 --> 00:50:14,860
- Rolled omelet.
- Let's take it.

1490
00:50:14,860 --> 00:50:16,110
- Music,
- The two of us will go out first.

1491
00:50:16,110 --> 00:50:17,210
- cue.
- Run out shortly afterward.

1492
00:50:17,940 --> 00:50:19,110
Let's go.

1493
00:50:19,230 --> 00:50:20,570
All right, Jae Suk.

1494
00:50:20,570 --> 00:50:21,940
(They charge to the stage.)

1495
00:50:24,110 --> 00:50:25,550
- This step looks weird.
- Try to look cool.

1496
00:50:26,210 --> 00:50:27,440
(They grab each other's neck
and dance in a cool way.)

1497
00:50:27,440 --> 00:50:28,820
Why did you guys come to us?

1498
00:50:28,820 --> 00:50:30,110
- What is this?
- Why did you guys come to us?

1499
00:50:30,110 --> 00:50:31,750
(Why are you passing through here?)

1500
00:50:31,750 --> 00:50:33,460
(Peek-a-boo)

1501
00:50:33,460 --> 00:50:34,730
- What is this?
- Why did you guys come to us?

1502
00:50:34,730 --> 00:50:35,860
- Hold on.
- What is this?

1503
00:50:35,860 --> 00:50:37,750
Hold on.
Why did you guys come to us?

1504
00:50:37,960 --> 00:50:39,230
What are you guys doing?

1505
00:50:39,230 --> 00:50:40,530
Why did you guys come to us?

1506
00:50:41,130 --> 00:50:44,230
- Why did you guys come to us?
- What is going on?

1507
00:50:45,340 --> 00:50:47,170
Hold on. Guys. Guys.

1508
00:50:47,170 --> 00:50:48,570
The teams should take turns.

1509
00:50:48,570 --> 00:50:50,440
- Why did you take over the stage?
- Seriously.

1510
00:50:50,440 --> 00:50:52,030
(Amidst the chaos)

1511
00:50:52,030 --> 00:50:53,340
- Why did you take over the stage?
- Seriously.

1512
00:50:53,530 --> 00:50:55,900
- This isn't a collaboration.
- What is this?

1513
00:50:55,900 --> 00:50:57,340
- The teams should take turns.
- That's right.

1514
00:50:57,340 --> 00:50:58,880
So Min, what are you doing?

1515
00:50:59,020 --> 00:51:00,690
What are you doing?

1516
00:51:01,280 --> 00:51:02,440
- The teams should take turns.
- Look at So Min.

1517
00:51:02,440 --> 00:51:03,820
What is So Min doing?

1518
00:51:03,820 --> 00:51:05,650
What are you doing?

1519
00:51:05,880 --> 00:51:06,980
Hey!

1520
00:51:06,980 --> 00:51:08,820
You should focus on
paying off the debt!

1521
00:51:08,820 --> 00:51:11,420
- I am working hard.
- All right. Okay.

1522
00:51:12,400 --> 00:51:13,750
Gosh, this song is...

1523
00:51:13,920 --> 00:51:14,960
Let's go.

1524
00:51:14,960 --> 00:51:17,000
(Is it "Honey" by Park Jin Young?)

1525
00:51:17,130 --> 00:51:18,770
- It's Park Jin Young's song.
- They know the dance.

1526
00:51:18,770 --> 00:51:20,270
- Go out there.
- JYP Entertainment.

1527
00:51:20,270 --> 00:51:21,360
They are like a machine.

1528
00:51:21,360 --> 00:51:25,530
(All members of TWICE dance
to Park Jin Young's song.)

1529
00:51:25,840 --> 00:51:27,610
All of them know the dance.

1530
00:51:27,610 --> 00:51:30,280
(The master dancer
jumps onto the stage again.)

1531
00:51:31,020 --> 00:51:32,550
They all know the dance.

1532
00:51:33,340 --> 00:51:35,610
There are more members
of other teams.

1533
00:51:35,610 --> 00:51:36,780
This is...

1534
00:51:37,320 --> 00:51:39,190
(She commands the stage.)

1535
00:51:39,190 --> 00:51:40,960
- Dahyun.
- Look at Dahyun.

1536
00:51:40,960 --> 00:51:42,880
- Dahyun.
- No one can take the center.

1537
00:51:42,880 --> 00:51:45,690
It's Dahyun's spot.

1538
00:51:45,690 --> 00:51:49,360
No one can go
near Dahyun or Momo.

1539
00:51:49,360 --> 00:51:50,360
Dahyun.

1540
00:51:50,360 --> 00:51:52,340
Momo, go to the front.

1541
00:51:53,770 --> 00:51:56,630
(The 2nd war
to take the center begins.)

1542
00:51:57,800 --> 00:51:59,380
Let's see what happens.

1543
00:51:59,380 --> 00:52:00,500
Hold on.

1544
00:52:00,980 --> 00:52:03,250
Why do you keep trying
to go to the front?

1545
00:52:04,110 --> 00:52:05,420
Why are you going to the front?

1546
00:52:05,980 --> 00:52:07,110
That was incredible.

1547
00:52:07,170 --> 00:52:09,590
- We did it.
- What was that?

1548
00:52:09,590 --> 00:52:10,750
Dahyun, what kind of dance was that?

1549
00:52:10,750 --> 00:52:12,590
This result reflects the dance
you have shown so far.

1550
00:52:12,590 --> 00:52:13,780
All right.

1551
00:52:13,780 --> 00:52:16,150
- Dahyun should get a vote.
- She was the best.

1552
00:52:16,250 --> 00:52:17,900
1, 2, 3.

1553
00:52:18,900 --> 00:52:22,820
(Team Orange and Team White
succeed to get a side dish.)

1554
00:52:24,070 --> 00:52:26,190
(Bowing)

1555
00:52:26,340 --> 00:52:27,630
Where are you going?

1556
00:52:27,630 --> 00:52:29,460
Thank you.

1557
00:52:29,960 --> 00:52:31,500
Kwang Soo's team has 100 dollars.

1558
00:52:31,500 --> 00:52:33,480
Team Gray has minus 200 dollars.

1559

(Current Rankings)

1560
00:52:34,550 --> 00:52:36,050
(Team White, Team Purple,
Team Orange, and Team Gray)

1561
00:52:36,050 --> 00:52:38,550
Captains, come on out...

1562
00:52:38,550 --> 00:52:40,150
- and distribute the money.
- Do they distribute the money?

1563
00:52:40,920 --> 00:52:42,880
- Nayeon.
- Nayeon, I have no doubt.

1564
00:52:42,880 --> 00:52:44,380
- Me neither. I trust you.
- I have no doubt.

1565
00:52:44,750 --> 00:52:46,090
Suk Jin, do this right.

1566
00:52:46,650 --> 00:52:48,650
We can't place last.

1567
00:52:48,860 --> 00:52:50,150
Minus 200 dollars?

1568
00:52:50,530 --> 00:52:51,590
Minus 200 dollars?

1569
00:52:51,730 --> 00:52:53,550
Wait right there.

1570
00:52:54,090 --> 00:52:56,630
- Don't worry.
- We showed great teamwork.

1571
00:52:56,630 --> 00:52:58,340
(Momo turns in
the distribution plan first.)

1572
00:52:58,340 --> 00:53:00,000
Turn it in if you are ready.

1573
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:02,230
(The 4 captains
finish distributing the money.)

1574
00:53:02,270 --> 00:53:03,800
I will give you the money.

1575
00:53:03,800 --> 00:53:06,130
Write down the amount here.

1576
00:53:06,130 --> 00:53:07,480
Kwang Soo's team, take the money.

1577
00:53:08,940 --> 00:53:11,940
(Kwang Soo checks the amount.)

1578
00:53:11,940 --> 00:53:13,250
(Kwang Soo got 0 dollars.)

1579
00:53:13,250 --> 00:53:15,820
What? What?

1580
00:53:15,820 --> 00:53:17,520
- Why do I have 230 dollars?
- What?

1581
00:53:18,320 --> 00:53:19,820
Didn't we have 100 dollars?

1582
00:53:20,550 --> 00:53:22,420
(The dividend rate is 0 percent.)

1583
00:53:22,420 --> 00:53:23,650
Okay. Here.

1584
00:53:23,650 --> 00:53:25,630
(How did Captain Suk Jin divide
minus 200 dollars?)

1585
00:53:25,630 --> 00:53:27,590
(Jong Kook got minus 200 dollars.)

1586
00:53:27,590 --> 00:53:28,730
(Suk Jin, Sana, and Jihyo got
0 dollars.)

1587
00:53:28,730 --> 00:53:30,940
- This is driving me crazy.
- It's fun this way.

1588
00:53:31,130 --> 00:53:32,960
- He gave all of it to you, right?
- This is driving me crazy.

1589
00:53:32,960 --> 00:53:34,270
I didn't take any money
from you guys.

1590
00:53:34,270 --> 00:53:35,400
(He tries to win their approval.)

1591
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:38,030
- This round was so hard.
- Hey.

1592
00:53:38,030 --> 00:53:40,210
- Why did I get so much?
- I know. Why did I get so much?

1593
00:53:40,300 --> 00:53:41,380
Why did I get so much?

1594
00:53:41,380 --> 00:53:42,610
You gave money to everyone
except for me.

1595
00:53:42,610 --> 00:53:44,520
I will give you money later.

1596
00:53:44,820 --> 00:53:47,050
I will give you
a lot of money later.

1597
00:53:47,050 --> 00:53:49,150
(Rankings After Distribution)

1598
00:53:49,150 --> 00:53:51,480
(So Min, Momo, Dahyun, Tzuyu,
and Nayeon will get a prize.)

1599
00:53:51,480 --> 00:53:52,750
(Kwang Soo, Jeongyeon,
and Jong Kook will get a penalty.)

1600
00:53:52,750 --> 00:53:55,190
Now, write down the money
you want to bet to be the captain.

1601
00:53:55,190 --> 00:53:56,860
Who wants to be the captain
this time?

1602
00:53:57,420 --> 00:53:58,690
Do you want to be the captain?

1603
00:53:59,500 --> 00:54:00,860
Sure. I will be it.

1604
00:54:01,130 --> 00:54:03,190
- Go ahead.
- Team Jae Suk is done, and...

1605
00:54:03,190 --> 00:54:05,670
Can I take out a loan?
Then you will get 50 dollars anyway.

1606
00:54:05,670 --> 00:54:07,610
- 40, 40, 40, 40 dollars.
- Can we take out a loan?

1607
00:54:07,610 --> 00:54:08,670
I will stand surety for 100 dollars.

1608
00:54:08,670 --> 00:54:10,630
- 200 dollars.
- 200 dollars?

1609
00:54:10,840 --> 00:54:12,280
For how much did you stand surety?

1610
00:54:12,280 --> 00:54:14,780
- He wanted 200 dollars.
- 200 dollars?

1611
00:54:15,250 --> 00:54:17,750
- Make me the captain this time.
- Sure thing, Dahyun.

1612
00:54:17,750 --> 00:54:19,920
Okay. So we write down zero dollars.

1613
00:54:20,210 --> 00:54:22,110
It will be okay.

1614
00:54:22,110 --> 00:54:23,210
(They agree to write down
0 dollars except for Dahyun.)

1615
00:54:23,210 --> 00:54:24,460
To make Dahyun the captain,

1616
00:54:24,460 --> 00:54:26,610
everyone else wrote down
zero dollars.

1617
00:54:26,610 --> 00:54:28,150
- Okay?
- Dahyun, write 10 dollars.

1618
00:54:28,150 --> 00:54:29,590
(Team White agrees to write down
zero dollars.)

1619
00:54:29,590 --> 00:54:30,690
You wrote down zero dollars, right?

1620
00:54:30,690 --> 00:54:31,730
All right.

1621
00:54:32,090 --> 00:54:34,960
- We will announce the results.
- Okay.

1622
00:54:34,960 --> 00:54:36,590
- Jae Suk's team.
- Okay.

1623
00:54:36,590 --> 00:54:38,960
- Tzuyu bet zero dollars.
- See?

1624
00:54:38,960 --> 00:54:40,570
- Jae Suk bet zero dollars.
- That's right.

1625
00:54:41,440 --> 00:54:43,230
- Se Chan bet 20 dollars.
- Okay!

1626
00:54:43,230 --> 00:54:44,940
(Se Chan bet 20 dollars.)

1627
00:54:45,380 --> 00:54:46,380
Okay!

1628
00:54:47,570 --> 00:54:48,840
That's...

1629
00:54:48,840 --> 00:54:50,500
- He is unbelievable.
- That's...

1630
00:54:50,500 --> 00:54:52,150
- Dahyun bet 30 dollars.
- What?

1631
00:54:52,150 --> 00:54:53,280
30 dollars.

1632
00:54:53,920 --> 00:54:55,110
Dahyun bet 30 dollars.

1633
00:54:55,110 --> 00:54:57,340
(She is scolding him with her eyes.)

1634
00:54:57,980 --> 00:54:59,250
- What?
- I knew this would happen!

1635
00:55:00,150 --> 00:55:01,860
- Dahyun didn't trust you.
- I knew this would happen!

1636
00:55:02,550 --> 00:55:04,320
- That's incredible.
- He isn't...

1637
00:55:04,320 --> 00:55:05,730
a part of the team.

1638
00:55:05,730 --> 00:55:08,300
- How could you be like that?
- I am sorry, Captain.

1639
00:55:08,900 --> 00:55:10,320
- How did you know?
- All right. Just you wait.

1640
00:55:10,320 --> 00:55:11,460
Dahyun is the captain.

1641
00:55:11,460 --> 00:55:13,130
Captain, please remember this
when you distribute the money.

1642
00:55:13,130 --> 00:55:15,230
- I will do that.
- This is a disaster.

1643
00:55:15,230 --> 00:55:16,460
(Se Chan's treason failed.)

1644
00:55:16,460 --> 00:55:17,940
Unbelievable.

1645
00:55:17,940 --> 00:55:19,880
Ji Hyo and Mina bet zero dollars.

1646
00:55:19,880 --> 00:55:21,880
- Chaeyoung bet 10 dollars.
- Really?

1647
00:55:22,380 --> 00:55:23,880
- She is ambitious.
- You gave it a try.

1648
00:55:24,520 --> 00:55:26,420
Momo bet 220 dollars,
and Haha bet 50 dollars.

1649
00:55:26,420 --> 00:55:27,570
Darn it!

1650
00:55:27,650 --> 00:55:30,110
(Momo bet 220 dollars,
and Haha bet 50 dollars.)

1651
00:55:30,480 --> 00:55:32,150
When did you write down 220 dollars?

1652
00:55:32,280 --> 00:55:34,280
- Did she bet 220 dollars again?
- 220 dollars?

1653
00:55:34,280 --> 00:55:35,530
Does she have that much money?

1654
00:55:35,530 --> 00:55:37,150
How will you pay back the money?

1655
00:55:37,150 --> 00:55:38,920
- Please give me some time.
- Seriously.

1656
00:55:38,920 --> 00:55:41,530
- We have the last round.
- I lent you 300 dollars.

1657
00:55:41,530 --> 00:55:43,070
220 dollars?

1658
00:55:43,070 --> 00:55:45,070
How did Momo bet 220 dollars?

1659
00:55:45,070 --> 00:55:46,090
Haha!

1660
00:55:46,340 --> 00:55:47,730
Suk Jin's team.

1661
00:55:48,800 --> 00:55:50,610
Jong Kook, Sana, and Jihyo
bet zero dollars.

1662
00:55:50,610 --> 00:55:51,980
Suk Jin bet 30 dollars.

1663
00:55:52,610 --> 00:55:53,940
Suk Jin.

1664
00:55:53,940 --> 00:55:55,440
You keep being the captain.

1665
00:55:56,500 --> 00:55:57,820
He is in power for a long time.

1666
00:55:57,820 --> 00:55:59,570
I have never seen Jihyo and Sana
make that kind of a face.

1667
00:55:59,570 --> 00:56:00,710
What is wrong with you?

1668
00:56:00,710 --> 00:56:03,610
Kwang Soo's team is last.

1669
00:56:03,610 --> 00:56:04,980
Jeongyeon bet zero dollars.

1670
00:56:05,190 --> 00:56:06,590
- You didn't bet any money?
- No.

1671
00:56:06,590 --> 00:56:08,460
Nayeon bet 30 dollars.

1672
00:56:08,750 --> 00:56:09,980
(Kwang Soo even took out a loan
to become the captain.)

1673
00:56:09,980 --> 00:56:13,190
Kwang Soo bet 220 dollars,
and So Min bet 230 dollars.

1674
00:56:13,190 --> 00:56:17,170
(Kwang Soo bet 220 dollars,
and So Min bet 230 dollars.)

1675
00:56:18,360 --> 00:56:21,670
(So Min stood surety
and backstabbed him.)

1676
00:56:21,670 --> 00:56:22,960
She went all in.

1677
00:56:22,960 --> 00:56:24,440
She is unbelievable.

1678
00:56:25,000 --> 00:56:26,340
Even if she comes in last...

1679
00:56:26,340 --> 00:56:27,630
(She is savoring the happiness
10 dollars brought her.)

1680
00:56:27,630 --> 00:56:29,280
I wanted to be the captain for once.

1681
00:56:29,880 --> 00:56:31,650
- So Min, you are unbelievable.
- You are incredible.

1682
00:56:31,650 --> 00:56:33,570
- You are incredible.
- Now,

1683
00:56:34,020 --> 00:56:35,940
let's have lunch.
We will bring in the food.

1684
00:56:35,940 --> 00:56:37,750
- Okay.
- I can't eat right now.

1685
00:56:38,380 --> 00:56:40,110
I lost my appetite.

1686
00:56:41,480 --> 00:56:42,590
Eat up, everyone.

1687
00:56:42,590 --> 00:56:44,550
- Enjoy the food.
- Enjoy the food.

1688
00:56:44,550 --> 00:56:45,550
(They enjoy a meal
with the side dishes they earned.)

1689
00:56:45,860 --> 00:56:47,360
- What is this?
- What is this?

1690
00:56:47,360 --> 00:56:48,960
This is amazing. What is this?

1691
00:56:48,960 --> 00:56:50,400
It smells good, right?

1692
00:56:50,400 --> 00:56:51,690
It's the scent of shampoo.

1693
00:56:51,690 --> 00:56:52,690
(The scent of shampoo welcomes them
at the site of the third mission.)

1694
00:56:53,270 --> 00:56:56,670
Oh, my sponsor is here. Mr. Sponsor.

1695
00:56:56,670 --> 00:56:58,380
- So Min.
- Yes?

1696
00:56:59,210 --> 00:57:00,980
You need to pay me back soon.

1697
00:57:01,780 --> 00:57:02,980
Mr. Sponsor.

1698
00:57:04,650 --> 00:57:06,070
(Staring)

1699
00:57:06,940 --> 00:57:08,590
(She approaches Kwang Soo.)

1700
00:57:08,590 --> 00:57:10,190
(Ripping)

1701
00:57:11,710 --> 00:57:13,360
I wanted to rip it once.

1702
00:57:13,360 --> 00:57:14,360
What is...

1703
00:57:14,860 --> 00:57:16,530
- She ripped it off.
- Why...

1704
00:57:17,800 --> 00:57:20,420
You did a good job.
You ripped it off tastefully.

1705
00:57:20,530 --> 00:57:22,300
I was sad that it ended so quickly.

1706
00:57:22,300 --> 00:57:24,590
- You didn't get to rip one off.
- No.

1707
00:57:24,590 --> 00:57:27,770
- This is the final mission.
- Okay.

1708
00:57:27,770 --> 00:57:30,940
The final mission is
Touch More and More.

1709
00:57:31,480 --> 00:57:32,800
Touch More and More.

1710
00:57:33,670 --> 00:57:34,800
They're witty.

1711
00:57:34,840 --> 00:57:36,000
(She loves it.)

1712
00:57:36,550 --> 00:57:37,920
It will be like a tournament.

1713
00:57:37,980 --> 00:57:41,650
The 2 representatives of 2 teams
will play the game first.

1714
00:57:41,940 --> 00:57:44,750
On the slippery pyramid
that is made of Styrofoam,

1715
00:57:44,750 --> 00:57:47,150
they will play tag
on offense or defense.

1716
00:57:47,860 --> 00:57:50,960
Both players will start
with paint on the gloves.

1717
00:57:50,960 --> 00:57:53,300
If the offensive team touches
the defensive team's name tag...

1718
00:57:53,300 --> 00:57:55,900
and gets paint on it,
that person is out.

1719
00:57:55,900 --> 00:57:58,190
The moment one member is out,

1720
00:57:58,190 --> 00:58:00,440
another member
of the same team will enter.

1721
00:58:00,440 --> 00:58:02,630
The offense and defense
change every 30 seconds.

1722
00:58:02,630 --> 00:58:05,400
You win when everyone
in the opposing team is eliminated.

1723
00:58:05,630 --> 00:58:06,900
It will be hard.

1724
00:58:06,900 --> 00:58:08,070
We just need to touch the name tag.

1725
00:58:08,070 --> 00:58:10,780
That's right. You just need to get
some paint on the name tag.

1726
00:58:13,280 --> 00:58:16,250
The female members will go first.

1727
00:58:16,690 --> 00:58:18,650
Tzuyu and Dahyun need a hair tie.

1728
00:58:18,650 --> 00:58:19,650
Thank you.

1729
00:58:21,530 --> 00:58:22,980
Let's see how slippery it is.

1730
00:58:23,190 --> 00:58:24,380
(Sliding)

1731
00:58:25,000 --> 00:58:26,300
(Smiling)

1732
00:58:28,860 --> 00:58:29,960
I look cool, right?

1733
00:58:31,000 --> 00:58:32,000
Don't I look cool?

1734
00:58:32,300 --> 00:58:33,340
Haha.

1735
00:58:33,340 --> 00:58:34,360
(Haha, look at me.)

1736
00:58:34,800 --> 00:58:36,940
(Faking his reaction)

1737
00:58:36,940 --> 00:58:38,280
It's seriously cool.

1738
00:58:39,980 --> 00:58:41,000
I got goosebumps.

1739
00:58:42,670 --> 00:58:43,780
That's incredible.

1740
00:58:43,780 --> 00:58:44,840
(For whom is she putting on
a performance?)

1741
00:58:45,110 --> 00:58:46,480
(She is cute.)

1742
00:58:47,670 --> 00:58:49,780
- That's incredible.
- Why am I doing this?

1743
00:58:50,480 --> 00:58:52,590
Seriously. I got goosebumps.

1744
00:58:52,590 --> 00:58:55,150
Please put paint on your gloves.

1745
00:58:55,150 --> 00:58:56,150
Okay.

1746
00:58:56,550 --> 00:58:57,550
Give me a pair of gloves.

1747
00:58:58,500 --> 00:58:59,820
I have gloves right here.

1748
00:58:59,820 --> 00:59:00,860
(I have gloves right here.)

1749
00:59:00,860 --> 00:59:01,860
(Throwing)

1750
00:59:02,770 --> 00:59:04,030
(Hurling)

1751
00:59:04,030 --> 00:59:05,570
I am sorry.

1752
00:59:05,690 --> 00:59:06,690
(His feelings are hurt.)

1753
00:59:06,690 --> 00:59:07,800
I am sorry.

1754
00:59:08,170 --> 00:59:10,000
- I got flustered too.
- I could have gone to you.

1755
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:12,340
I got flustered too. I'm sorry.

1756
00:59:12,340 --> 00:59:13,440
It looked like you were throwing
a snack to a dog.

1757
00:59:13,440 --> 00:59:15,280
He was on his way to you too.

1758
00:59:15,280 --> 00:59:16,550
I am sorry. I got flustered.

1759
00:59:16,550 --> 00:59:17,650
That was too...

1760
00:59:17,650 --> 00:59:19,550
(I didn't think
you would be like that.)

1761
00:59:19,920 --> 00:59:20,940
My goodness.

1762
00:59:21,250 --> 00:59:23,110
(Dahyun is putting paint
on her gloves.)

1763
00:59:23,110 --> 00:59:24,110
There we go.

1764
00:59:24,380 --> 00:59:25,780
Put enough paint on the gloves.

1765
00:59:25,780 --> 00:59:27,020
Dahyun is putting a lot of paint
on them.

1766
00:59:27,020 --> 00:59:28,190
That's good.

1767
00:59:28,190 --> 00:59:30,030
Are you dying your gloves?

1768
00:59:30,130 --> 00:59:32,150
- Are you ready?
- Yes.

1769
00:59:32,150 --> 00:59:33,300
(Their enthusiasm is at its max.)

1770
00:59:33,960 --> 00:59:35,530
Please enter.

1771
00:59:35,800 --> 00:59:37,460
Dahyun, are you on your way
to perform surgery?

1772
00:59:37,820 --> 00:59:38,960
Will you perform surgery?

1773
00:59:38,960 --> 00:59:40,090
Dahyun, perform surgery.

1774
00:59:41,270 --> 00:59:42,440
We are on offense, right?

1775
00:59:42,440 --> 00:59:44,300
I will blow the whistle
after 30 seconds...

1776
00:59:44,300 --> 00:59:46,340
to change the offense and defense.

1777
00:59:46,340 --> 00:59:48,940
I am scared. I am scared.

1778
00:59:48,940 --> 00:59:50,710
Get ready. Set.

1779
00:59:50,710 --> 00:59:51,980
(The 1st round starts.)

1780
00:59:52,150 --> 00:59:53,210
Set.

1781
00:59:54,280 --> 00:59:55,820
Hang in there for 30 seconds.

1782
00:59:55,820 --> 00:59:57,840
The positions change
when the whistle sounds.

1783
00:59:58,150 --> 00:59:59,750
- Okay.
- There you go.

1784
00:59:59,750 --> 01:00:02,230
- Oh, my goodness.
- That's good.

1785
01:00:02,880 --> 01:00:04,800
- She is good.
- Hang in there for 30 seconds.

1786
01:00:04,800 --> 01:00:06,090
- Jeongyeon, let's go.
- Jeongyeon.

1787
01:00:06,090 --> 01:00:07,190
She is almost there.

1788
01:00:07,190 --> 01:00:08,460
- She is almost there.
- Come on down.

1789
01:00:08,460 --> 01:00:10,230
Hang in there for 30 seconds. No!

1790
01:00:10,230 --> 01:00:11,500
Come on.

1791
01:00:11,500 --> 01:00:13,860
(Will Jeongyeon get eliminated
right away?)

1792
01:00:13,860 --> 01:00:16,210
Tzuyu, she is coming down.

1793
01:00:16,270 --> 01:00:17,270
Jeongyeon!

1794
01:00:17,940 --> 01:00:19,340
Hang in there for 30 seconds. No!

1795
01:00:19,340 --> 01:00:20,340
- I got her!
- Jeongyeon!

1796
01:00:20,340 --> 01:00:22,070
- She is out!
- No!

1797
01:00:22,070 --> 01:00:23,670
(I got her!)

1798
01:00:23,670 --> 01:00:24,750
(Jeongyeon is out.)

1799
01:00:24,750 --> 01:00:27,380
- Jeongyeon is out.
- Go in there, So Min.

1800
01:00:27,380 --> 01:00:28,380
(So Min goes in.)

1801
01:00:28,690 --> 01:00:29,710
This is...

1802
01:00:30,750 --> 01:00:31,860
She is over there.

1803
01:00:31,860 --> 01:00:33,190
So Min, eliminate someone.

1804
01:00:33,360 --> 01:00:35,030
- Get her.
- Get her.

1805
01:00:37,820 --> 01:00:41,190
(With the sound of whistle,
Dahyun moves to attack!)

1806
01:00:41,190 --> 01:00:43,960
(She isn't too far from So Min.)

1807
01:00:43,960 --> 01:00:46,170
(Will she eliminate So Min
after Jeongyeon?)

1808
01:00:46,170 --> 01:00:47,500
Hang in there for 30 seconds.

1809
01:00:47,570 --> 01:00:48,630
That's good.

1810
01:00:50,070 --> 01:00:52,380
(She shows slapstick comedy
on her way down.)

1811
01:00:52,530 --> 01:00:54,210
- Are you okay, Dahyun?
- That was great.

1812
01:00:54,210 --> 01:00:55,610
Dahyun.

1813
01:00:55,750 --> 01:00:58,780
Dahyun brought out
the best of this game.

1814
01:00:59,020 --> 01:01:00,920
(This is fun.)

1815
01:01:00,920 --> 01:01:02,210
I haven't seen that in a while.

1816
01:01:02,210 --> 01:01:03,710
(Her instinct to attack
doesn't subside.)

1817
01:01:03,710 --> 01:01:05,820
- So Min, you are much faster.
- Tzuyu, get So Min.

1818
01:01:06,110 --> 01:01:07,820
No, no. What are you doing?

1819
01:01:08,860 --> 01:01:09,980
(She hands in her name tag.)

1820
01:01:09,980 --> 01:01:11,650
I got her! I got her!

1821
01:01:11,900 --> 01:01:13,960
- I got paint on her name tag.
- You can slide in your hand...

1822
01:01:13,960 --> 01:01:16,000
- since the floor is slippery.
- Kwang Soo, come on in.

1823
01:01:16,000 --> 01:01:17,530
Both of them are good.

1824
01:01:18,900 --> 01:01:19,900
(Kwang Soo gets a chance
to attack...)

1825
01:01:19,900 --> 01:01:20,900
Run away!

1826
01:01:20,900 --> 01:01:22,070
(as soon as he enters!)

1827
01:01:22,730 --> 01:01:23,940
(He takes big steps
with his long legs.)

1828
01:01:23,940 --> 01:01:25,280
- Kwang Soo is fast.
- Here comes Kwang Soo.

1829
01:01:25,280 --> 01:01:26,730
- Kwang Soo.
- Are we on offense?

1830
01:01:26,730 --> 01:01:28,170
Yes. Why are you running away?

1831
01:01:28,570 --> 01:01:29,980
- Are we on offense?
- Yes.

1832
01:01:29,980 --> 01:01:32,340
(She runs away
by bouncing on her butt.)

1833
01:01:33,480 --> 01:01:35,590
(This master of slapstick comedy
has a bright future.)

1834
01:01:36,090 --> 01:01:37,090
Run away.

1835
01:01:37,590 --> 01:01:38,980
(He falls on his side.)

1836
01:01:39,980 --> 01:01:41,190
(Thanks to Kwang Soo's hard work,)

1837
01:01:41,190 --> 01:01:42,190
(Tzuyu is out.)

1838
01:01:42,190 --> 01:01:43,480
Kwang Soo, are you okay?

1839
01:01:43,480 --> 01:01:46,230
Tzuyu is out. Tzuyu is out.

1840
01:01:47,030 --> 01:01:48,030
He is scary.

1841
01:01:49,320 --> 01:01:51,400
(He gives a big bow.)

1842
01:01:51,400 --> 01:01:53,000
(The viewers find it entertaining.)

1843
01:01:53,500 --> 01:01:55,130
(Kwang Soo gives a lesson...)

1844
01:01:55,130 --> 01:01:56,770
(to the rising star
of slapstick comedy.)

1845
01:01:57,730 --> 01:01:58,880
Dahyun is out!

1846
01:01:59,980 --> 01:02:01,550
- Go.
- Go in there, Jae Suk.

1847
01:02:01,550 --> 01:02:02,570
Go in there, Jae Suk.

1848
01:02:02,570 --> 01:02:04,500
Hurry up. Kwang Soo is right there.

1849
01:02:05,780 --> 01:02:07,320
You need to catch Kwang Soo.

1850
01:02:07,320 --> 01:02:08,440
Eliminate Kwang Soo first.

1851
01:02:08,440 --> 01:02:10,380
- Kwang Soo is on the roll.
- Hurry up.

1852
01:02:10,380 --> 01:02:11,380
Hurry up.

1853
01:02:12,380 --> 01:02:13,480
Are we on defense?

1854
01:02:13,480 --> 01:02:14,650
- We are on offense.
- The other way!

1855
01:02:14,650 --> 01:02:17,420
Hurry up and attack him!

1856
01:02:19,190 --> 01:02:20,960
(My goodness!)

1857
01:02:22,820 --> 01:02:24,900
(He slides down the pyramid
to attack.)

1858
01:02:25,840 --> 01:02:27,360
Kwang Soo is running away well.

1859
01:02:27,360 --> 01:02:28,400
He is fast.

1860
01:02:30,230 --> 01:02:32,210
(He slides down
and blocks Kwang Soo.)

1861
01:02:32,210 --> 01:02:33,440
Jae Suk, this way.

1862
01:02:33,900 --> 01:02:35,900
(The positions change.)

1863
01:02:36,300 --> 01:02:37,380
My goodness.

1864
01:02:37,380 --> 01:02:38,570
Go, go. Catch him.

1865
01:02:38,570 --> 01:02:39,940
My goodness.

1866
01:02:39,940 --> 01:02:41,070
(Decalcomania slapstick comedy)

1867
01:02:41,650 --> 01:02:43,110
- His legs are too long.
- Hurry up!

1868
01:02:43,550 --> 01:02:44,820
Push him.

1869
01:02:45,750 --> 01:02:47,590
(The positions change!)

1870
01:02:47,590 --> 01:02:48,960
The positions changed, right?

1871
01:02:48,960 --> 01:02:50,480
- Yes.
- Did it change?

1872
01:02:50,480 --> 01:02:51,820
(The tables have turned.)

1873
01:02:52,550 --> 01:02:55,090
(Jae Suk paints his face.)

1874
01:02:55,360 --> 01:02:57,130
The positions changed.

1875
01:02:57,130 --> 01:02:58,670
(Se Chan quickly joins.)

1876
01:02:58,960 --> 01:03:00,940
Put your hand under his back.

1877
01:03:01,800 --> 01:03:03,070
Come on.

1878
01:03:03,070 --> 01:03:04,070
I touched it.

1879
01:03:04,070 --> 01:03:05,380
- Kwang Soo is out.
- He did it.

1880
01:03:05,380 --> 01:03:06,980
We are on defense now.

1881
01:03:06,980 --> 01:03:08,000
(Nayeon is the only member left.)

1882
01:03:08,710 --> 01:03:09,940
Nayeon, attack!

1883
01:03:10,110 --> 01:03:11,550
Attack.

1884
01:03:12,020 --> 01:03:13,440
Nayeon, I am sorry!

1885
01:03:14,880 --> 01:03:16,280
(Look at his face.)

1886
01:03:16,280 --> 01:03:18,250
Nayeon, we need to place first.

1887
01:03:18,860 --> 01:03:20,880
(I am scared.)

1888
01:03:21,190 --> 01:03:22,690
- Nayeon.
- Come on.

1889
01:03:22,690 --> 01:03:24,360
Kwang Soo.

1890
01:03:24,360 --> 01:03:25,900
Run away! Run away!

1891
01:03:26,130 --> 01:03:27,190
(Take this!)

1892
01:03:29,500 --> 01:03:31,770
(They create wind with their butts.)

1893
01:03:32,840 --> 01:03:34,630
Okay. We did it.

1894
01:03:35,170 --> 01:03:36,730
I am scared.

1895
01:03:36,960 --> 01:03:39,300
Jae Suk's team wins
the first round.

1896
01:03:39,340 --> 01:03:40,340
Okay.

1897
01:03:42,150 --> 01:03:43,480
We are up next.

1898
01:03:43,480 --> 01:03:46,940
Sana and Jihyo's team
will attack first.

1899
01:03:47,380 --> 01:03:48,750
The two members...

1900
01:03:48,750 --> 01:03:49,750
She is so scary.

1901
01:03:49,750 --> 01:03:51,090
- No, one member goes in at a time.
- She is scary.

1902
01:03:51,090 --> 01:03:54,210
Jihyo is so scary.

1903
01:03:54,710 --> 01:03:56,590
(Just you wait.)

1904
01:03:57,280 --> 01:03:58,500
Let's go.

1905
01:03:58,500 --> 01:04:01,090
Let's begin. Get ready. Set.

1906
01:04:01,090 --> 01:04:02,400
(The 2nd round starts.)

1907
01:04:03,190 --> 01:04:04,190
(Both teams move to the top.)

1908
01:04:04,190 --> 01:04:06,000
- They are going up.
- They are going up.

1909
01:04:06,030 --> 01:04:07,400
- They are going up.
- Why is Jihyo so fast?

1910
01:04:07,530 --> 01:04:10,460
Jihyo is so fast.

1911
01:04:10,460 --> 01:04:12,570
(Ji Hyo and Chaeyoung
hurriedly run away.)

1912
01:04:12,570 --> 01:04:13,610
Jihyo.

1913
01:04:14,070 --> 01:04:15,550
Ji Hyo is out!

1914
01:04:15,550 --> 01:04:16,780
(She slides down...)

1915
01:04:16,780 --> 01:04:17,900
(and quickly paints
Ji Hyo's name tag!)

1916
01:04:17,900 --> 01:04:19,380
You are doing great!

1917
01:04:19,380 --> 01:04:21,170
- She is incredible.
- Go in there.

1918
01:04:21,170 --> 01:04:22,210
Go in there, Momo.

1919
01:04:22,840 --> 01:04:24,650
Go in there. Go in there, Momo.

1920
01:04:24,650 --> 01:04:26,280
(Momo's team will attack now.)

1921
01:04:26,960 --> 01:04:28,480
(Jihyo was chasing after Chaeyoung.)

1922
01:04:28,480 --> 01:04:30,230
Get her. Go this way, Momo.

1923
01:04:30,230 --> 01:04:31,690
- Get her.
- Go this way.

1924
01:04:31,750 --> 01:04:33,000
Over there.

1925
01:04:33,000 --> 01:04:34,000
(The baby beasts have a face-off.)

1926
01:04:34,550 --> 01:04:36,030
Get her.

1927
01:04:36,030 --> 01:04:37,420
I got her!

1928
01:04:37,590 --> 01:04:39,070
- Really? Did it get on my name tag?
- Jihyo is out.

1929
01:04:39,090 --> 01:04:40,900
- Jihyo was fast.
- Go in there.

1930
01:04:40,900 --> 01:04:43,360
Do I go in there?

1931
01:04:43,360 --> 01:04:44,530
- Get him.
- Do I need to run away?

1932
01:04:44,530 --> 01:04:45,670
Run away, Jong Kook.

1933
01:04:45,670 --> 01:04:47,480
- Do I need to run away?
- Did Jong Kook enter already?

1934
01:04:47,480 --> 01:04:48,780
Jong Kook is fast.

1935
01:04:49,980 --> 01:04:50,980
(Suk Jin's team will attack now.)

1936
01:04:50,980 --> 01:04:52,570
- Attack.
- Run away!

1937
01:04:53,020 --> 01:04:54,280
Run away!

1938
01:04:54,280 --> 01:04:55,320
(The final boss
makes everyone panic.)

1939
01:04:55,880 --> 01:04:57,150
What is Chaeyoung doing?

1940
01:04:58,280 --> 01:04:59,710
- Let's go to the final round.
- I am sorry.

1941
01:04:59,710 --> 01:05:01,150
- No!
- Chaeyoung is out.

1942
01:05:01,210 --> 01:05:02,690
Chaeyoung is out.

1943
01:05:03,280 --> 01:05:04,480
Take her out.

1944
01:05:04,750 --> 01:05:06,960
- There you go.
- Good job.

1945
01:05:08,130 --> 01:05:09,690
Let's go to the final round.

1946
01:05:10,690 --> 01:05:11,860
This is the last batch already.

1947
01:05:11,860 --> 01:05:13,000
Did Momo go in?

1948
01:05:14,000 --> 01:05:15,030
(Momo's team will attack now!)

1949
01:05:15,030 --> 01:05:16,030
Corner him.

1950
01:05:16,030 --> 01:05:17,400
- Corner him.
- Corner him.

1951
01:05:17,440 --> 01:05:19,130
Who is out?

1952
01:05:19,570 --> 01:05:20,730
Look at Jong Kook.

1953
01:05:20,730 --> 01:05:22,110
You need to take Jong Kook out
right now.

1954
01:05:22,110 --> 01:05:23,880
- My goodness.
- Mina, I am sorry.

1955
01:05:24,380 --> 01:05:25,550
This is your last chance.

1956
01:05:25,920 --> 01:05:27,170
Mina, I am sorry.

1957
01:05:27,170 --> 01:05:28,170
(Slipping)

1958
01:05:28,170 --> 01:05:29,340
(Mina spots a chance!)

1959
01:05:29,340 --> 01:05:30,420
She did it!

1960
01:05:30,480 --> 01:05:32,780
(Will Mina's attack be successful?)

1961
01:05:33,210 --> 01:05:34,920
Mina, I am sorry.

1962
01:05:35,190 --> 01:05:36,860
(Jong Kook is out.)

1963
01:05:36,860 --> 01:05:38,460
Jong Kook is out.

1964
01:05:38,460 --> 01:05:40,500
- Jong Kook is out.
- Jong Kook, what was that?

1965
01:05:41,900 --> 01:05:43,570
Mina, good job.

1966
01:05:44,590 --> 01:05:45,590
(The positions change
as Suk Jin enter!)

1967
01:05:45,590 --> 01:05:46,630
Are we attacking now?

1968
01:05:46,960 --> 01:05:48,360
Mina, be careful.

1969
01:05:48,360 --> 01:05:49,670
Be careful.

1970
01:05:50,570 --> 01:05:52,170
(Falling down)

1971
01:05:52,610 --> 01:05:55,440
(His weak legs
made people shed tears.)

1972
01:05:55,440 --> 01:05:56,440
(His arms are even weaker.)

1973
01:05:56,440 --> 01:05:58,110
Mina, hang in there.

1974
01:05:58,110 --> 01:05:59,820
She will beat Suk Jin.

1975
01:06:00,610 --> 01:06:02,690
(Suk Jin and Mina have
a fierce match.)

1976
01:06:04,750 --> 01:06:07,090
(Slipping)

1977
01:06:07,380 --> 01:06:08,590
Suk Jin.

1978
01:06:08,590 --> 01:06:09,690
(It's Mina's turn to attack.)

1979
01:06:09,690 --> 01:06:11,280
Look at Suk Jin.

1980
01:06:11,280 --> 01:06:13,500
- Attack!
- Suk Jin is so fast.

1981
01:06:13,800 --> 01:06:15,590
- That's hilarious.
- Suk Jin can crawl so fast.

1982
01:06:16,030 --> 01:06:17,070
That's cute.

1983
01:06:18,460 --> 01:06:20,900
(Crawling on four
helps Suk Jin move faster.)

1984
01:06:20,900 --> 01:06:22,730
Suk Jin is so fast.

1985
01:06:22,730 --> 01:06:24,440
Suk Jin is out.

1986
01:06:24,900 --> 01:06:27,130
- That was hilarious.
- Suk Jin, what was that?

1987
01:06:27,170 --> 01:06:28,400
That was hilarious.

1988
01:06:29,550 --> 01:06:30,670
(Sana is the last member
of Team Suk Jin.)

1989
01:06:30,670 --> 01:06:32,320
- She's going up.
- Sana, it's your turn to attack!

1990
01:06:32,320 --> 01:06:33,650
(It's Sana's turn to attack.)

1991
01:06:33,750 --> 01:06:35,150
- She's fast.
- She's fast.

1992
01:06:35,150 --> 01:06:36,520
You can do this. Be careful.

1993
01:06:36,880 --> 01:06:38,820
- No!
- Run away.

1994
01:06:38,820 --> 01:06:40,360
- Slide!
- Haha is out.

1995
01:06:40,360 --> 01:06:41,420
(A jump shot)

1996
01:06:41,590 --> 01:06:42,880
(Haha is out.)

1997
01:06:42,880 --> 01:06:44,190
Haha is out.

1998
01:06:44,190 --> 01:06:45,500
- Go, Sana!
- Incredible!

1999
01:06:46,090 --> 01:06:47,630
Will Sana save us?

2000
01:06:48,400 --> 01:06:50,920
(If Sana eliminates Mina,
Team Suk Jin will win.)

2001
01:06:50,920 --> 01:06:52,070
Why is she so fast?

2002
01:06:52,940 --> 01:06:55,230
(Sana, the predator on the Styrofoam
pyramid, charges at Mina.)

2003
01:06:55,230 --> 01:06:56,670
(Will she eliminate Mina...)

2004
01:06:56,670 --> 01:06:57,860
Will Sana save us?

2005
01:06:57,900 --> 01:07:00,570
(and dramatically
turn the game around?)

2006
01:07:00,670 --> 01:07:01,710
Sana will...

2007
01:07:01,710 --> 01:07:03,400
(Touch!)

2008
01:07:03,400 --> 01:07:04,610
Will Sana save us?

2009
01:07:04,880 --> 01:07:06,150
- Mina is out.
- Mina is out.

2010
01:07:06,650 --> 01:07:08,110
We won!

2011
01:07:08,210 --> 01:07:09,590
- Sana!
- Sana!

2012
01:07:10,520 --> 01:07:13,050
- Sana saved us!
- Yes!

2013
01:07:13,050 --> 01:07:14,150
(Sana made up for
Suk Jin's lousy performance.)

2014
01:07:14,150 --> 01:07:15,880
- Sana saved them.
- Unbelievable.

2015
01:07:16,650 --> 01:07:18,530
Let's start
the third-place match now.

2016
01:07:18,530 --> 01:07:21,000
Team Haha will attack first.

2017
01:07:21,000 --> 01:07:22,320
(Team Momo attacks first.)

2018
01:07:23,400 --> 01:07:24,500
Kwang Soo, come over here.

2019
01:07:25,190 --> 01:07:26,940
Hey, what's that?

2020
01:07:26,940 --> 01:07:28,270
Why are you wearing your name tag
on the front?

2021
01:07:28,270 --> 01:07:30,860
(So Min is wearing her name tag
on the front?)

2022
01:07:31,230 --> 01:07:32,980
(What's wrong?)

2023
01:07:33,440 --> 01:07:35,940
- So Min.
- Don't do that!

2024
01:07:36,500 --> 01:07:38,980
- Go ahead and rip it off.
- What are you doing?

2025
01:07:39,050 --> 01:07:41,020
She hasn't changed a bit.

2026
01:07:41,020 --> 01:07:42,940
- She's even meaner now.
- She's become even weirder.

2027
01:07:42,940 --> 01:07:46,020
- Wear it on the back.
- You can't do that.

2028
01:07:46,150 --> 01:07:47,980
While she was away from the show...

2029
01:07:47,980 --> 01:07:49,730
What happened to her?

2030
01:07:50,480 --> 01:07:51,750
Chaeyoung is out.

2031
01:07:52,420 --> 01:07:53,960
Song Ji Hyo is out.

2032
01:07:54,550 --> 01:07:55,690
Momo is out.

2033
01:07:56,070 --> 01:07:57,300
Go in, Nayeon.

2034
01:07:57,900 --> 01:07:58,900
What am I supposed to do?

2035
01:07:58,900 --> 01:08:00,090
- Run away.
- You're on defense.

2036
01:08:00,690 --> 01:08:02,530
- Attack!
- You're on offense.

2037
01:08:03,900 --> 01:08:05,500
- Haha!
- Yes?

2038
01:08:05,730 --> 01:08:06,940
Go away.

2039
01:08:09,070 --> 01:08:10,280
(Nayeon hit Haha?)

2040
01:08:11,380 --> 01:08:13,710
(Haha is hit on the head.)

2041
01:08:16,150 --> 01:08:17,340
She hit me.

2042
01:08:18,210 --> 01:08:19,750
You're pathetic.

2043
01:08:19,860 --> 01:08:21,750
Haha, you're...

2044
01:08:21,780 --> 01:08:23,920
- You're pathetic.
- Run away!

2045
01:08:24,380 --> 01:08:25,750
(Jeongyeon eliminates Mina.)

2046
01:08:25,750 --> 01:08:27,030
Run away!

2047
01:08:27,230 --> 01:08:29,590
(Haha, left alone,
is determined to win.)

2048
01:08:30,830 --> 01:08:32,200
Jeongyeon is out!

2049
01:08:32,270 --> 01:08:34,460
- Am I out?
- Haha is pathetic.

2050
01:08:34,570 --> 01:08:35,700
Kick him!

2051
01:08:36,370 --> 01:08:37,610
Kick him!

2052
01:08:37,700 --> 01:08:40,130
(Following Jong Kook's advice,
Nayeon uses her feet.)

2053
01:08:40,300 --> 01:08:41,440
Haha!

2054
01:08:43,150 --> 01:08:45,040
(A proper low kick)

2055
01:08:45,040 --> 01:08:46,120
He told me to kick you.

2056
01:08:46,120 --> 01:08:47,620
Jong Kook told me to kick you.

2057
01:08:47,950 --> 01:08:49,150
He told me to kick you.

2058
01:08:49,650 --> 01:08:52,020
- He told me to kick you.
- Rip off his name tag!

2059
01:08:52,910 --> 01:08:54,820
(She's laughing so hard
that she can't breathe.)

2060
01:08:55,420 --> 01:08:57,030
Hey! Timeout!

2061
01:08:57,920 --> 01:08:59,550
His big toe got in!

2062
01:09:00,200 --> 01:09:01,620
I had no idea.

2063
01:09:01,620 --> 01:09:02,620
(Shameless)

2064
01:09:03,570 --> 01:09:04,700
That's hilarious.

2065
01:09:05,290 --> 01:09:06,630
Look at Kwang Soo's face.

2066
01:09:06,630 --> 01:09:07,700
I can't believe him.

2067
01:09:09,000 --> 01:09:10,870
- Haha, you're still in the game.
- Let's do this!

2068
01:09:10,870 --> 01:09:12,110
- Let's attack!
- We're attacking now.

2069
01:09:12,940 --> 01:09:14,700
Attack! Get him!

2070
01:09:15,650 --> 01:09:17,650
(Kwang Soo slides down
with a blank look on his face.)

2071
01:09:17,650 --> 01:09:19,410
- Okay!
- Haha is out.

2072
01:09:19,410 --> 01:09:21,040
(Haha is out.)

2073
01:09:21,170 --> 01:09:22,910
(An angry headlock)

2074
01:09:23,540 --> 01:09:25,160
We won!

2075
01:09:25,250 --> 01:09:26,710
- We won!
- We won!

2076
01:09:26,910 --> 01:09:29,550
- We won!
- We're in third place.

2077
01:09:30,550 --> 01:09:31,750
Team Haha is at the bottom.

2078
01:09:32,230 --> 01:09:33,360
They're at the bottom.

2079
01:09:33,950 --> 01:09:36,290
- Let's start the finals!
- It's the finals.

2080
01:09:36,420 --> 01:09:37,570
- Let's win!
- Let's do this.

2081
01:09:37,570 --> 01:09:38,700
You guys are attacking first.

2082
01:09:38,700 --> 01:09:39,940
- We are?
- Yes.

2083
01:09:39,940 --> 01:09:41,200
- We're attacking first? Okay.
- We're attacking first.

2084
01:09:41,200 --> 01:09:42,330
Ready.

2085
01:09:42,330 --> 01:09:43,700
(We have to win 1st place.)

2086
01:09:43,700 --> 01:09:44,830
Get set.

2087
01:09:44,830 --> 01:09:46,000
(The finals...)

2088
01:09:46,000 --> 01:09:47,240
(start.)

2089
01:09:47,240 --> 01:09:49,540
Slowly. 30 seconds is short.

2090
01:09:49,540 --> 01:09:51,040
(They're aggressive
from the beginning.)

2091
01:09:51,040 --> 01:09:52,370
Way to go, Sana!

2092
01:09:52,370 --> 01:09:54,040
- Run away!
- Go, Sana!

2093
01:09:54,040 --> 01:09:56,080
- Sana is so good.
- Way to go!

2094
01:09:56,080 --> 01:09:58,340
- Sana is amazing.
- Okay!

2095
01:09:58,340 --> 01:10:00,250
- Sana is running!
- Nice!

2096
01:10:00,880 --> 01:10:02,330
(The pyramid is extremely slippery.)

2097
01:10:02,330 --> 01:10:03,360
How can she...

2098
01:10:04,160 --> 01:10:05,590
No!

2099
01:10:05,590 --> 01:10:07,200
- This way!
- My gosh!

2100
01:10:07,920 --> 01:10:09,160
- Hold on.
- Be careful.

2101
01:10:09,160 --> 01:10:10,330
You're not out yet.

2102
01:10:13,290 --> 01:10:14,900
- Tzuyu!
- Attack!

2103
01:10:15,800 --> 01:10:17,610
- No!
- Attack!

2104
01:10:18,110 --> 01:10:19,580
- Attack!
- Gosh.

2105
01:10:19,580 --> 01:10:21,410
Dahyun.

2106
01:10:22,500 --> 01:10:24,910
(Dahyun slides down,
and Sana runs down.)

2107
01:10:27,280 --> 01:10:28,710
Dahyun is out.

2108
01:10:29,340 --> 01:10:30,490
(Se Chan goes in.)

2109
01:10:30,490 --> 01:10:31,790
Run away. Don't attack yet.

2110
01:10:31,790 --> 01:10:33,160
- Tzuyu!
- Tzuyu!

2111
01:10:33,410 --> 01:10:35,450
We're going to win.
When Tzuyu is out...

2112
01:10:35,450 --> 01:10:37,360
(They did touch
Tzuyu's name tag, but...)

2113
01:10:37,360 --> 01:10:38,920
- I touched it!
- The whistle was blown first.

2114
01:10:39,200 --> 01:10:40,990
- Wait!
- Tzuyu is not out.

2115
01:10:40,990 --> 01:10:42,530
- She's not out.
- Why not?

2116
01:10:42,770 --> 01:10:44,770
- The whistle was blown first.
- Don't attack yet.

2117
01:10:44,770 --> 01:10:45,990
- Hey, not yet!
- It hasn't started.

2118
01:10:45,990 --> 01:10:48,290
We were talking. You should wait.

2119
01:10:48,290 --> 01:10:50,160
- Why...
- Why are you angry?

2120
01:10:50,160 --> 01:10:51,700
- Why are you angry?
- Why are you angry?

2121
01:10:51,700 --> 01:10:53,580
- Why is he so serious?
- Why is he angry?

2122
01:10:53,580 --> 01:10:55,300
Why is he so bossy?

2123
01:10:55,300 --> 01:10:56,450
Why are you angry?

2124
01:10:56,450 --> 01:10:57,650
- I mean...
- Why are you so bossy?

2125
01:10:57,650 --> 01:10:59,480
- We were deciding if she was out.
- Why are you angry?

2126
01:10:59,480 --> 01:11:00,740
- Why are you angry?
- He looked so serious.

2127
01:11:00,740 --> 01:11:01,990
Of course, I'm angry.

2128
01:11:02,040 --> 01:11:04,040
You shouldn't have approached her
at that moment, you punk.

2129
01:11:04,120 --> 01:11:05,150
Why...

2130
01:11:05,150 --> 01:11:06,250
Why are you so serious?

2131
01:11:06,250 --> 01:11:07,410
What's with you?

2132
01:11:07,410 --> 01:11:09,230
- Let's continue.
- All right.

2133
01:11:09,230 --> 01:11:10,750
You shouldn't have hit her
while we were talking.

2134
01:11:10,750 --> 01:11:12,090
Team White is on offense.

2135
01:11:12,090 --> 01:11:13,550
Okay. Tzuyu is still in the game.
Let's go.

2136
01:11:13,590 --> 01:11:14,790
Ready, go.

2137
01:11:16,200 --> 01:11:17,460
- Nice!
- There you go.

2138
01:11:17,490 --> 01:11:18,870
- Hey.
- Se Chan.

2139
01:11:18,870 --> 01:11:21,460
- Go up! Sana is so good.
- There you go.

2140
01:11:21,460 --> 01:11:22,660
(The pyramid is my playground.)

2141
01:11:22,660 --> 01:11:23,800
Look at them.

2142
01:11:24,270 --> 01:11:25,800
(Sliding)

2143
01:11:26,910 --> 01:11:28,780
(Jihyo barely saves herself.)

2144
01:11:29,410 --> 01:11:31,280
(But Se Chan slides down too.)

2145
01:11:31,280 --> 01:11:32,340
- Kick him!
- She's out.

2146
01:11:32,340 --> 01:11:33,910
Jihyo is out.

2147
01:11:33,910 --> 01:11:35,040
Jihyo was incredible.

2148
01:11:35,290 --> 01:11:36,410
Should I go in?

2149
01:11:36,410 --> 01:11:38,790
- Go in!
- Go, Tzuyu!

2150
01:11:39,410 --> 01:11:41,050
- Tzuyu, you're on defense.
- Run!

2151
01:11:41,120 --> 01:11:42,530
(Jong Kook eliminates Tzuyu
right away.)

2152
01:11:42,530 --> 01:11:43,880
- Tzuyu, you're on defense.
- Run!

2153
01:11:44,690 --> 01:11:46,360
Tzuyu is out.

2154
01:11:46,830 --> 01:11:49,200
- Jae Suk, come in!
- It's my turn.

2155
01:11:49,200 --> 01:11:50,530
You can do this!

2156
01:11:51,530 --> 01:11:53,990
(Just when Jae Suk and Se Chan
are pushed into a corner...)

2157
01:11:54,370 --> 01:11:56,960
The positions have been changed!

2158
01:11:56,960 --> 01:11:58,540
(I have to get to the top.)

2159
01:11:58,540 --> 01:12:00,200
The positions have been changed!
We have to get to the top!

2160
01:12:00,200 --> 01:12:02,410
We have to get to the top!

2161
01:12:02,500 --> 01:12:04,200
We have to...

2162
01:12:06,520 --> 01:12:08,540
(Jong Kook kicks everyone away
from the top.)

2163
01:12:08,540 --> 01:12:09,690
Way to go!

2164
01:12:10,320 --> 01:12:11,910
This is unfair.

2165
01:12:11,910 --> 01:12:13,410
- They can't do anything.
- They won't get to the top.

2166
01:12:13,620 --> 01:12:15,120
- Way to go!
- We want to go up.

2167
01:12:15,290 --> 01:12:16,860
We have to get to the top.

2168
01:12:17,360 --> 01:12:18,700
Nice!

2169
01:12:18,700 --> 01:12:20,450
(Jong Kook Fortress)

2170
01:12:20,450 --> 01:12:21,550
Gosh.

2171
01:12:21,660 --> 01:12:22,730
That's so unfair.

2172
01:12:22,730 --> 01:12:23,960
(They keep rolling down
the pyramid.)

2173
01:12:24,030 --> 01:12:25,160
We're going to win!

2174
01:12:25,440 --> 01:12:26,700
Gosh, this is not okay.

2175
01:12:27,440 --> 01:12:28,540
(I've been waiting for this moment.)

2176
01:12:28,540 --> 01:12:29,660
Hold on!

2177
01:12:30,440 --> 01:12:31,570
From the other direction, Sana.

2178
01:12:31,570 --> 01:12:33,500
Attack from the other direction,
Sana.

2179
01:12:34,280 --> 01:12:35,500
- From the other direction.
- They're surrounded.

2180
01:12:36,080 --> 01:12:37,780
(Sana tries to intercept Se Chan.)

2181
01:12:37,780 --> 01:12:38,780
- It's over.
- She caught him.

2182
01:12:39,150 --> 01:12:40,370
(But she fails.)

2183
01:12:40,370 --> 01:12:41,370
She failed.

2184
01:12:41,370 --> 01:12:42,650
- Am I out?
- No.

2185
01:12:42,650 --> 01:12:43,910
- No?
- No.

2186
01:12:43,910 --> 01:12:45,580
(Jong Kook's target changes
from Jae Suk to Se Chan.)

2187
01:12:46,160 --> 01:12:48,250
(The whistle blows again.)

2188
01:12:49,050 --> 01:12:50,730
(Jumping down)

2189
01:12:51,490 --> 01:12:53,420
(His eyes, nostrils, and mouth
open wide.)

2190
01:12:53,660 --> 01:12:55,090
Jong Kook!

2191
01:12:55,090 --> 01:12:56,870
(Jong Kook is surrounded.)

2192
01:12:58,120 --> 01:12:59,290
Jong Kook!

2193
01:12:59,290 --> 01:13:00,570
(What should I do?)

2194
01:13:00,830 --> 01:13:02,070
Gosh.

2195
01:13:02,370 --> 01:13:03,570
I can't believe this.

2196
01:13:04,630 --> 01:13:06,610
(The airplane takes off.)

2197
01:13:08,280 --> 01:13:10,700
(Where are you going, sir?)

2198
01:13:11,340 --> 01:13:12,410
Good job.

2199
01:13:12,410 --> 01:13:14,280
(The customer is
200 percent satisfied.)

2200
01:13:14,520 --> 01:13:17,380
Not even Ji Ho does that anymore.

2201
01:13:18,040 --> 01:13:19,250
Good job.

2202
01:13:19,690 --> 01:13:21,450
(The airplane takes off again.)

2203
01:13:22,160 --> 01:13:24,530
(Fly with Jong Kook Air.)

2204
01:13:24,530 --> 01:13:25,750
Good job.

2205
01:13:25,830 --> 01:13:27,420
- Let's run away.
- Go away.

2206
01:13:28,250 --> 01:13:29,420
Change!

2207
01:13:29,420 --> 01:13:31,200
(They're all exhausted,
and it's time to change positions.)

2208
01:13:31,200 --> 01:13:32,270
This is hilarious.

2209
01:13:32,700 --> 01:13:33,900
(They compete
to get to the top first.)

2210
01:13:33,900 --> 01:13:35,910
She's getting him.

2211
01:13:37,460 --> 01:13:38,800
(Jae Suk is eliminated
while catching his breath.)

2212
01:13:39,870 --> 01:13:42,300
(The last survivor, Se Chan,
is exhausted too.)

2213
01:13:44,000 --> 01:13:46,080
(Se Chan is out.)

2214
01:13:47,780 --> 01:13:49,340
We won!

2215
01:13:49,340 --> 01:13:50,540
Team Gray wins!

2216
01:13:50,540 --> 01:13:52,490
(Team Suk Jin wins!)

2217
01:13:52,550 --> 01:13:53,990
I won without even playing.

2218
01:13:54,690 --> 01:13:56,920
I've only played airplane
with my nephews before.

2219
01:13:57,660 --> 01:13:59,050
This is humiliating.

2220
01:14:00,290 --> 01:14:01,360
Everyone,

2221
01:14:01,360 --> 01:14:03,230
according to
the final mission results,

2222
01:14:03,230 --> 01:14:05,540
Team Suk Jin wins 500 dollars.

2223
01:14:06,460 --> 01:14:08,800
500 dollars? We won 500 dollars!

2224
01:14:08,940 --> 01:14:11,440
Team Dahyun wins 300 dollars.

2225
01:14:11,440 --> 01:14:12,780
(Team Dahyun, in 2nd place,
wins 300 dollars.)

2226
01:14:13,040 --> 01:14:16,080
Team So Min wins 100 dollars.

2227
01:14:16,080 --> 01:14:17,540
(Team So Min, in 3rd place,
wins 100 dollars.)

2228
01:14:17,540 --> 01:14:19,210
Lastly, Team Momo wins...

2229
01:14:19,210 --> 01:14:20,410
minus 200 dollars.

2230
01:14:21,020 --> 01:14:23,150
- Oh, my gosh.
- 200 dollars?

2231
01:14:23,190 --> 01:14:24,520
- Minus 200 dollars.
- We won 100 dollars.

2232
01:14:24,520 --> 01:14:25,910
Please distribute the money.

2233
01:14:25,910 --> 01:14:27,190
(The money is distributed.)

2234
01:14:27,190 --> 01:14:29,950
- I'll divide it equally.
- Really?

2235
01:14:31,050 --> 01:14:32,090
Doesn't it hurt?

2236
01:14:32,090 --> 01:14:33,230
Dahyun, I trust you.

2237
01:14:33,230 --> 01:14:34,530
You can trust me.

2238
01:14:34,920 --> 01:14:36,490
Do you want to win prizes?

2239
01:14:37,070 --> 01:14:38,530
Sana and Jihyo,
do you want to win prizes?

2240
01:14:38,530 --> 01:14:40,070
- That'd be nice.
- Of course.

2241
01:14:40,070 --> 01:14:41,630
(That goes without saying.)

2242
01:14:42,410 --> 01:14:43,570
I don't...

2243
01:14:43,570 --> 01:14:45,300
expect anything from him.

2244
01:14:45,300 --> 01:14:47,800
I'll be different this time.

2245
01:14:47,800 --> 01:14:49,650
As the oldest member... Of course.

2246
01:14:49,670 --> 01:14:52,840
The top three might come
from our team.

2247
01:14:52,950 --> 01:14:54,280
If the money is distributed
in the right way...

2248
01:14:54,780 --> 01:14:56,410
Suk Jin spent too much money.

2249
01:14:56,520 --> 01:14:58,490
Haha, pay me back.

2250
01:14:58,820 --> 01:15:00,210
Are you going to pay me back or not?

2251
01:15:00,380 --> 01:15:01,490
I'm sorry.

2252
01:15:01,490 --> 01:15:02,550
(Shameless)

2253
01:15:02,550 --> 01:15:04,420
Then I have a negative amount.

2254
01:15:04,790 --> 01:15:08,200
Let me announce how the money
will be distributed in this round.

2255
01:15:08,450 --> 01:15:10,120
Suk Jin is giving...

2256
01:15:10,120 --> 01:15:13,240
300 dollars to Jong Kook
and 200 dollars to himself.

2257
01:15:13,240 --> 01:15:14,960
What? Really?

2258
01:15:15,960 --> 01:15:17,370
Why?

2259
01:15:17,500 --> 01:15:18,700
He doesn't want to get in trouble.

2260
01:15:19,280 --> 01:15:22,410
Suk Jin doesn't want to
get in trouble with Jong Kook.

2261
01:15:22,870 --> 01:15:24,410
- So Min is giving...
- I had no choice.

2262
01:15:24,480 --> 01:15:25,710
50 dollars to herself,

2263
01:15:26,340 --> 01:15:27,670
20 dollars each
to Nayeon and Jeongyeon,

2264
01:15:27,670 --> 01:15:28,740
and 10 dollars to Kwang Soo.

2265
01:15:29,120 --> 01:15:30,340
- That's not bad.
- Right?

2266
01:15:30,340 --> 01:15:31,580
- I...
- That's pretty fair.

2267
01:15:31,580 --> 01:15:33,160
- That's nice of her.
- Next up is Dahyun.

2268
01:15:33,250 --> 01:15:35,730
- Our captain, Dahyun.
- It'll be simple.

2269
01:15:35,830 --> 01:15:37,490
She's giving 70 dollars each
to Jae Suk and Se Chan...

2270
01:15:37,490 --> 01:15:38,750
and 80 dollars each
to Dahyun and Tzuyu.

2271
01:15:39,230 --> 01:15:40,750
- That's not bad.
- Unbelievable.

2272
01:15:40,750 --> 01:15:42,270
- What is this?
- I like it.

2273
01:15:42,270 --> 01:15:44,290
- Se Chan.
- That's enough.

2274
01:15:44,290 --> 01:15:45,460
That's more than enough.

2275
01:15:45,460 --> 01:15:47,290
Why is this team so peaceful?

2276
01:15:47,290 --> 01:15:48,790
Captain Momo got...

2277
01:15:48,790 --> 01:15:51,130
minus 200 dollars.

2278
01:15:51,800 --> 01:15:53,110
It all goes to Haha.

2279
01:15:53,110 --> 01:15:55,410
(Haha gets minus 200 dollars.)

2280
01:15:55,410 --> 01:15:56,450
It all goes to Haha?

2281
01:15:56,800 --> 01:15:58,240
- Seriously...
- Haha gets minus 200 dollars?

2282
01:15:58,240 --> 01:16:00,320
- She's very consistent.
- Gosh.

2283
01:16:00,780 --> 01:16:02,080
- She's incredible.
- She's unbelievable.

2284
01:16:02,080 --> 01:16:03,320
- Momo is amazing.
- I'm sorry.

2285
01:16:03,320 --> 01:16:04,650
If Haha gets minus 200 dollars...

2286
01:16:04,650 --> 01:16:06,320
- He'll definitely be penalized.
- Definitely.

2287
01:16:06,320 --> 01:16:07,450
All right.

2288
01:16:07,450 --> 01:16:11,050
Nayeon has paid Se Chan back
200 dollars.

2289
01:16:11,250 --> 01:16:12,990
Se Chan also gets 50 dollars
in interest.

2290
01:16:13,330 --> 01:16:17,330
So Min borrowed money
from Jae Suk and Kwang Soo,

2291
01:16:17,530 --> 01:16:18,990
but she can pay back
only one person.

2292
01:16:19,130 --> 01:16:21,440
And she chose to pay back Jae Suk.

2293
01:16:21,440 --> 01:16:22,910
- What about Kwang Soo?
- What happens to me?

2294
01:16:22,910 --> 01:16:25,110
Jae Suk gets 30 dollars
in interest.

2295
01:16:25,110 --> 01:16:27,330
And we'll deduct the deficit
from Kwang Soo's money.

2296
01:16:27,700 --> 01:16:28,740
What?

2297
01:16:28,740 --> 01:16:30,670
- What do you mean?
- I had...

2298
01:16:30,670 --> 01:16:32,820
- no other way.
- You're going to deduct 200?

2299
01:16:32,820 --> 01:16:35,990
Haha owed Suk Jin 300.

2300
01:16:35,990 --> 01:16:37,620
- He can't pay it back.
- I have to pay it back.

2301
01:16:37,620 --> 01:16:38,690
- 300 dollars?
- Yes.

2302
01:16:38,690 --> 01:16:41,050
- Why did you lend him so much?
- I might get the penalty.

2303
01:16:41,050 --> 01:16:42,990
First, I'll reveal prizes...

2304
01:16:42,990 --> 01:16:45,250
- perfect for the summer.
- That sounds great.

2305
01:16:45,250 --> 01:16:46,330
I wonder what it is.

2306
01:16:46,330 --> 01:16:47,550
It feels cool already.

2307
01:16:47,660 --> 01:16:49,120
Third place gets a circulator,

2308
01:16:49,120 --> 01:16:50,530
second place gets
a portable refrigerator,

2309
01:16:50,530 --> 01:16:52,090
and first place gets a wine cooler.

2310
01:16:53,370 --> 01:16:54,790
It's a wine cooler.

2311
01:16:54,790 --> 01:16:56,160
It's a cooler.

2312
01:16:56,440 --> 01:16:58,610
- Is that for wine?
- You're giving these away?

2313
01:16:58,610 --> 01:17:00,370
I have the results.

2314
01:17:00,580 --> 01:17:02,410
Top five will win prizes,

2315
01:17:02,580 --> 01:17:04,670
and the lowest three
will get penalties.

2316
01:17:04,840 --> 01:17:06,650
- 1st place is...
- 1st place.

2317
01:17:06,670 --> 01:17:08,650
Se Chan with 340 dollars.

2318
01:17:08,650 --> 01:17:09,690
Really?

2319
01:17:09,690 --> 01:17:10,790
That's awesome.

2320
01:17:11,150 --> 01:17:13,410
- I get to have a wine cooler?
- You don't even drink wine.

2321
01:17:13,410 --> 01:17:15,020
You'll put kimchi in there.

2322
01:17:15,020 --> 01:17:16,790
- I'll put something in it.
- He doesn't drink wine.

2323
01:17:17,230 --> 01:17:18,360
Am I in first place?

2324
01:17:19,030 --> 01:17:21,160
If Haha paid me back,
I would have been in first place.

2325
01:17:21,160 --> 01:17:22,230
That's true.

2326
01:17:22,830 --> 01:17:23,960
Second place is...

2327
01:17:23,960 --> 01:17:26,090
Jae Suk with 320 dollars.

2328
01:17:26,660 --> 01:17:28,940
Jae Suk. What happened to our team?

2329
01:17:29,110 --> 01:17:31,700
Third place is Tzuyu
with 310 dollars.

2330
01:17:31,700 --> 01:17:33,130
(3rd place is Tzuyu.)

2331
01:17:33,130 --> 01:17:35,540
Fourth place is Dahyun
with 300 dollars.

2332
01:17:35,540 --> 01:17:37,610
(4th place is Dahyun.)

2333
01:17:37,610 --> 01:17:39,410
We took it all.

2334
01:17:40,040 --> 01:17:41,980
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

2335
01:17:41,980 --> 01:17:44,340
What happened to them?
Why did they have so much money?

2336
01:17:44,340 --> 01:17:47,160
Besides the harmonious team,

2337
01:17:47,160 --> 01:17:49,250
there's one other person
getting a prize.

2338
01:17:49,250 --> 01:17:51,360
- Is it Momo?
- It's Suk Jin with 270 dollars.

2339
01:17:52,990 --> 01:17:54,400
Sir.

2340
01:17:55,290 --> 01:17:57,030
Congratulations, Mr. Jee.

2341
01:17:57,460 --> 01:18:00,270
- Where did you get 270 dollars?
- Do I have 270?

2342
01:18:00,400 --> 01:18:02,460
Sixth place was a tie.

2343
01:18:02,460 --> 01:18:03,500
With 100 dollars,

2344
01:18:04,070 --> 01:18:05,070
Sana and Jihyo.

2345
01:18:05,070 --> 01:18:06,080
(Sana and Jihyo tied in 6th place.)

2346
01:18:06,800 --> 01:18:07,940
It still feels good.

2347
01:18:07,940 --> 01:18:09,370
I'll give you the fan. Take it.

2348
01:18:09,370 --> 01:18:11,410
- It's okay.
- It's okay. We don't need it.

2349
01:18:11,540 --> 01:18:13,540
Please take it.

2350
01:18:13,540 --> 01:18:14,950
Tied in eighth place were...

2351
01:18:14,950 --> 01:18:16,790
Mina and Nayeon with 60 dollars.

2352
01:18:16,790 --> 01:18:18,540
- Nayeon.
- How?

2353
01:18:18,540 --> 01:18:20,450
- Chaeyoung had 50 dollars.
- Chaeyoung.

2354
01:18:20,450 --> 01:18:22,620
Jong Kook and Ji Hyo had 40.

2355
01:18:23,050 --> 01:18:24,080
I got 40?

2356
01:18:24,080 --> 01:18:25,550
Jeongyeon had 30.

2357
01:18:25,860 --> 01:18:27,550
There are four people left.

2358
01:18:27,550 --> 01:18:30,270
Momo, Kwang Soo, So Min, and Haha.

2359
01:18:30,620 --> 01:18:32,200
Three of you are getting penalties.

2360
01:18:32,200 --> 01:18:33,440
In the last place is...

2361
01:18:33,630 --> 01:18:35,740
Haha with minus 290 dollars.

2362
01:18:36,440 --> 01:18:38,240
I'm sorry, Mr. Jee.

2363
01:18:38,460 --> 01:18:40,130
- It's your fault.
- I'm sorry.

2364
01:18:40,130 --> 01:18:41,280
16th place.

2365
01:18:41,280 --> 01:18:42,670
Momo, you have to join me.

2366
01:18:42,780 --> 01:18:44,950
So Min with minus 200 dollars.

2367
01:18:44,950 --> 01:18:46,120
(16th place So Min will also be
getting the penalty.)

2368
01:18:46,120 --> 01:18:47,320
Am I exempt?

2369
01:18:47,320 --> 01:18:49,740
(She misheard.)

2370
01:18:50,380 --> 01:18:51,840
- You're getting the penalty.
- It's a penalty.

2371
01:18:51,840 --> 01:18:53,820
(You're wrong.)

2372
01:18:53,820 --> 01:18:55,020
Okay!

2373
01:18:55,750 --> 01:18:57,250
- What's wrong with her?
- What's wrong with her?

2374
01:18:57,250 --> 01:18:59,660
- I thought I was exempt.
- So Min, that includes you.

2375
01:18:59,660 --> 01:19:01,660
We have 14th and 15th places left.

2376
01:19:01,660 --> 01:19:03,230
- What happened?
- 14th place is exempt.

2377
01:19:03,230 --> 01:19:04,330
Who's exempt then?

2378
01:19:04,330 --> 01:19:07,660
1 person has minus 160,
and the other person has minus 170.

2379
01:19:07,660 --> 01:19:09,130
- Okay, it's a 10-dollar difference.
- My gosh.

2380
01:19:09,130 --> 01:19:11,630
In 14th place
with minus 160 dollars is...

2381
01:19:12,670 --> 01:19:13,780
Congratulations,

2382
01:19:13,870 --> 01:19:14,910
Momo.

2383
01:19:16,200 --> 01:19:17,450
- Count again!
- Okay.

2384
01:19:17,450 --> 01:19:19,540
- Congratulations, Momo.
- You did great.

2385
01:19:19,540 --> 01:19:21,710
Is it because she got 10 dollars
near the end?

2386
01:19:21,710 --> 01:19:22,740
That's true.

2387
01:19:22,820 --> 01:19:24,990
- You saved her.
- Let's do the penalties.

2388
01:19:24,990 --> 01:19:26,550
- What is it?
- What's the penalty?

2389
01:19:26,550 --> 01:19:28,120
- What do they do?
- Here's today's penalty.

2390
01:19:28,120 --> 01:19:30,330
There are 3 buckets.
1 contains flower petals,

2391
01:19:30,330 --> 01:19:33,230
one contains water, and
the last one contains black paint.

2392
01:19:33,900 --> 01:19:34,950
This is insane.

2393
01:19:34,950 --> 01:19:37,530
Please choose a number randomly.

2394
01:19:37,620 --> 01:19:39,270
Let Momo choose for me.

2395
01:19:39,540 --> 01:19:41,160
Number two.

2396
01:19:41,160 --> 01:19:42,200
Number two? Okay.

2397
01:19:42,200 --> 01:19:44,500
- Kwang Soo, I'll choose yours.
- Okay.

2398
01:19:44,500 --> 01:19:46,800
Number three for Kwang Soo.

2399
01:19:47,080 --> 01:19:48,280
I want...

2400
01:19:49,300 --> 01:19:50,450
number three.

2401
01:19:50,610 --> 01:19:52,300
- Do rock-paper-scissors.
- Let's do rock-paper-scissors.

2402
01:19:52,620 --> 01:19:53,840
Rock-paper-scissors.

2403
01:19:54,480 --> 01:19:55,710
Okay, we'll get the penalty
in this order.

2404
01:19:55,710 --> 01:19:57,020
1, 2, 3, okay?

2405
01:19:57,020 --> 01:19:58,490
I'm sorry, Kwang Soo.

2406
01:19:58,490 --> 01:19:59,990
- I'm sorry.
- One,

2407
01:19:59,990 --> 01:20:01,490
- It's okay.
- two...

2408
01:20:01,490 --> 01:20:02,750
- It's okay.
- This is not me.

2409
01:20:02,860 --> 01:20:03,920
Three.

2410
01:20:05,420 --> 01:20:06,900
Flower petals!

2411
01:20:08,620 --> 01:20:09,660
Flower petals!

2412
01:20:09,660 --> 01:20:10,700
What?

2413
01:20:10,700 --> 01:20:13,770
(Black and white)

2414
01:20:14,490 --> 01:20:16,500
- So Min.
- So Min.

2415
01:20:16,570 --> 01:20:17,940
- So Min.
- So Min.

2416
01:20:17,940 --> 01:20:19,330
My gosh!

2417
01:20:19,330 --> 01:20:20,670
- So Min.
- So Min.

2418
01:20:20,780 --> 01:20:22,800
- Why is it always you?
- So Min.

2419
01:20:22,800 --> 01:20:25,650
- Why did you choose that one?
- Wipe your eyes.

2420
01:20:25,650 --> 01:20:26,840
Why did you choose that one?

2421
01:20:26,840 --> 01:20:28,480
I said I wanted number three!

2422
01:20:29,290 --> 01:20:30,910
It was great seeing all of you
after a while.

2423
01:20:30,910 --> 01:20:32,880
TWICE, please come to the middle.

2424
01:20:32,880 --> 01:20:34,380
Let's hear what Momo has to say.

2425
01:20:34,620 --> 01:20:35,750
- Momo?
- Yes.

2426
01:20:36,330 --> 01:20:40,530
I'm sorry to his fans.

2427
01:20:40,530 --> 01:20:42,360
That's a relief.
I don't have too many fans.

2428
01:20:44,120 --> 01:20:45,400
- Hey.
- What?

2429
01:20:45,400 --> 01:20:46,660
What are you talking about?

2430
01:20:46,660 --> 01:20:49,500
We'll do our best
with our new song "More and More",

2431
01:20:49,500 --> 01:20:51,700
so please check it out
and send lots of love.

2432
01:20:51,700 --> 01:20:54,240
Also, Running Man was so much fun.

2433
01:20:54,240 --> 01:20:55,410
See you again!

2434
01:20:55,410 --> 01:20:57,500
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

2435
01:20:57,500 --> 01:21:00,210
(We would like to thank TWICE
for joining us today.)

2436
01:21:00,540 --> 01:21:02,150
(Running Man
convenience store is open.)

2437
01:21:02,580 --> 01:21:04,450
(4 store managers are here to
protect the convenience store.)

2438
01:21:04,450 --> 01:21:06,410
(Ji Chang Wook, Kim Yoo Jung,
Han Sunhwa, Do Sang Woo)

2439
01:21:07,160 --> 01:21:10,490
(An intense competition to obtain
the best convenience store items!)

2440
01:21:12,290 --> 01:21:13,400
(All of a sudden,)

2441
01:21:13,400 --> 01:21:15,090
(somebody is screaming
inside the convenience store.)

2442
01:21:15,090 --> 01:21:16,590
(It's a secret robbery...)

2443
01:21:16,590 --> 01:21:18,790
(away from the eyes
of the store managers!)

2444
01:21:19,120 --> 01:21:21,490
(They must steal the hot items
without anybody finding out!)

2445
01:21:21,870 --> 01:21:23,800
(Their territory tightens.)

2446
01:21:24,130 --> 01:21:25,940
(Those who try to steal
the hot items,)

2447
01:21:25,940 --> 01:21:28,500
(and those who are ready
for new deals)

2448
01:21:29,800 --> 01:21:32,740
(Their fates are
in their own hands now.)

2449
01:21:33,020 --> 01:21:34,870
(The temptations can come any time.
They cannot let their guards down!)

2450
01:21:35,450 --> 01:21:37,540
(A secret deal from the broker.
What will be the result?)

2451
01:21:38,490 --> 01:21:40,450
(Secret Broker Race:
Hot Items from Convenience Store)
