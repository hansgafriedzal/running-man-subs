1
00:00:04,960 --> 00:00:06,360
- Hello.
- Hello.

2
00:00:06,360 --> 00:00:07,530
Hello.

3
00:00:07,760 --> 00:00:08,790
- Is it just you and I?
- Just you?

4
00:00:08,790 --> 00:00:10,320
Yes. I guess you and I
are doing something.

5
00:00:10,790 --> 00:00:12,360
You two are a team today.

6
00:00:12,360 --> 00:00:13,700
- Are we a team?
- Yes.

7
00:00:13,700 --> 00:00:15,500
I'll tell you
once the guests are ready.

8
00:00:16,740 --> 00:00:19,430
I was surprised to see
today's guests on my way up here.

9
00:00:19,740 --> 00:00:22,000
I'm sure he was our guest,
but I didn't see his face.

10
00:00:22,110 --> 00:00:24,680
- We wore the same clothes.
- Really?

11
00:00:24,810 --> 00:00:26,070
I was embarrassed to see that.

12
00:00:26,840 --> 00:00:28,380
You might look better than him.

13
00:00:28,380 --> 00:00:29,380
You'll see.

14
00:00:29,380 --> 00:00:30,880
You might look better.

15
00:00:30,990 --> 00:00:33,220
It was so shocking. His style...

16
00:00:34,060 --> 00:00:35,590
- Gosh.
- Hello.

17
00:00:35,590 --> 00:00:36,780
- Hello.
- Hello.

18
00:00:36,780 --> 00:00:39,330
- Gosh, you're here.
- My goodness.

19
00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:42,160
(Glancing)

20
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:45,160
Don't do that. Stop it.

21
00:00:45,160 --> 00:00:48,130
(Check jackets and blue shirts)

22
00:00:49,030 --> 00:00:50,940
(They are wearing the same clothes,
but look totally different.)

23
00:00:50,940 --> 00:00:53,170
- Please have a seat.
- Please sit.

24
00:00:53,910 --> 00:00:57,670
(He's a great actor
and entertainer.)

25
00:00:57,670 --> 00:01:02,340
(Ong Seong Wu with magnetic charm
is back with his song, "Gravity.")

26
00:01:02,340 --> 00:01:04,120
- Hello.
- Hello.

27
00:01:04,120 --> 00:01:06,620
- Nice to meet you.
- Look who's here.

28
00:01:06,950 --> 00:01:10,690
(He's a rising star of 2020,
Lee Do Hyun with refreshing charm.)

29
00:01:10,690 --> 00:01:12,890
(He starred in "Prison Playbook"
and "Hotel del Luna.")

30
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,890
(He looks like
a cool cartoon character.)

31
00:01:15,890 --> 00:01:20,190
(Seo Ji Hun with
outstanding appearance)

32
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:22,700
Hey, ZICO.

33
00:01:22,700 --> 00:01:24,470
- Hello.
- ZICO.

34
00:01:24,470 --> 00:01:26,030
(ZICO who sang "Any Song,"
the biggest hit of 2020)

35
00:01:26,030 --> 00:01:27,470
I have a good feeling

36
00:01:27,470 --> 00:01:29,580
(He's trying to imitate ZICO.)

37
00:01:29,580 --> 00:01:31,340
- ZICO, have a seat.
- Please sit.

38
00:01:31,340 --> 00:01:32,470
- Nice to meet you.
- Hang on.

39
00:01:32,470 --> 00:01:33,470
Have a seat.

40
00:01:33,470 --> 00:01:34,840
- ZICO, you should sit here.
- What?

41
00:01:34,840 --> 00:01:36,390
- Where?
- Why?

42
00:01:36,390 --> 00:01:37,390
No.

43
00:01:37,390 --> 00:01:39,080
- Don't do that.
- What?

44
00:01:39,080 --> 00:01:40,890
Kwang Soo, please.

45
00:01:40,890 --> 00:01:42,080
It's worth a try.

46
00:01:42,080 --> 00:01:43,750
Let me give it a try.
Have a seat, ZICO.

47
00:01:43,750 --> 00:01:45,420
- What are we doing today?
- It's nothing.

48
00:01:45,420 --> 00:01:47,390
This is crazy.

49
00:01:47,690 --> 00:01:48,860
Are we a team?

50
00:01:48,860 --> 00:01:51,330
You're a team
with Kwang Soo as the center.

51
00:01:51,330 --> 00:01:54,170
You are Team Lee Kwang Soo
with outstanding appearances.

52
00:01:54,170 --> 00:01:56,330
(Team Lee Kwang Soo
with outstanding appearances)

53
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:59,030
This is crazy. Don't we look nice?

54
00:01:59,030 --> 00:02:02,580
You will have a race with Team
Ji Suk Jin of entertainers today.

55
00:02:03,380 --> 00:02:06,940
You should come up with a great pose
that will give you a head start...

56
00:02:06,940 --> 00:02:09,420
on Team Ji Suk Jin
on the special stage.

57
00:02:09,490 --> 00:02:11,140
(A great pose?)

58
00:02:12,490 --> 00:02:14,610
- This is crazy.
- Whatever we do,

59
00:02:14,610 --> 00:02:16,990
- you'll have to cover your face.
- Why?

60
00:02:16,990 --> 00:02:18,890
- It's supposed to be cool.
- That's not the pose.

61
00:02:18,890 --> 00:02:20,620
- I can do this.
- Or you could turn around.

62
00:02:20,620 --> 00:02:22,360
- You should look cool.
- Should I cover my whole face?

63
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:23,600
- Hey.
- Kwang Soo.

64
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:24,990
I'll just stand at the back.

65
00:02:24,990 --> 00:02:26,990
Don't ruin it
and just cover your face.

66
00:02:26,990 --> 00:02:29,670
You stay out of this, baby octopus.

67
00:02:30,140 --> 00:02:31,980
- I'm in trouble.
- What kind of pose shall we try?

68
00:02:31,980 --> 00:02:34,950
Let's just see how we look together.

69
00:02:35,300 --> 00:02:37,610
You know what? This is so...

70
00:02:37,610 --> 00:02:39,420
This is killing me.

71
00:02:39,420 --> 00:02:40,770
Can I go to another team?

72
00:02:40,770 --> 00:02:42,290
I don't think this is right.

73
00:02:42,290 --> 00:02:44,180
We're wearing the same shirts.

74
00:02:44,180 --> 00:02:46,420
Really? I want to go.

75
00:02:46,420 --> 00:02:49,890
Get me other clothes.
I'm going crazy here.

76
00:02:49,990 --> 00:02:51,180
This is so embarrassing.

77
00:02:51,180 --> 00:02:53,950
Do you think I should... I mean...

78
00:02:53,950 --> 00:02:55,890
Is it better that
I sit on one side? Gosh.

79
00:02:55,890 --> 00:02:57,490
Don't we look like caregivers
standing here?

80
00:02:57,490 --> 00:02:59,140
We look like caregivers.

81
00:02:59,140 --> 00:03:00,170
- I'm sorry.
- What should I do?

82
00:03:00,170 --> 00:03:03,140
You should sit somewhere else.
We look like your caregivers.

83
00:03:03,140 --> 00:03:06,270
Each of you should strike
a pose you want at the same time.

84
00:03:06,270 --> 00:03:07,930
- A pose I want?
- Yes.

85
00:03:08,670 --> 00:03:10,580
- Is this it?
- No.

86
00:03:10,580 --> 00:03:12,240
- This is good.
- It looks cool.

87
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:14,050
You look cool doing this.

88
00:03:14,420 --> 00:03:17,490
You look like you're about
to poke someone's buttocks.

89
00:03:17,790 --> 00:03:19,050
He's not like ZICO.

90
00:03:19,050 --> 00:03:20,390
(Same pose, different vibes)

91
00:03:20,390 --> 00:03:21,990
I look different.

92
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:24,180
- What about this one?
- Good.

93
00:03:24,180 --> 00:03:25,890
We all turn right.

94
00:03:25,890 --> 00:03:28,200
And we stand like steps.
It's like a gradation.

95
00:03:28,620 --> 00:03:31,390
- We go like this.
- It's a good idea.

96
00:03:31,390 --> 00:03:33,490
- That's good.
- And our looks get better going up.

97
00:03:33,490 --> 00:03:35,770
- Okay.
- It means you're the ugliest one.

98
00:03:35,770 --> 00:03:37,300
- No.
- Stay seated.

99
00:03:37,300 --> 00:03:39,240
- Our looks get better upward.
- It's not like that.

100
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:41,080
Come here. We can make it
look like human evolution.

101
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:42,850
Exactly. It's something like that.

102
00:03:42,850 --> 00:03:44,240
So the ameba should be here.

103
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:45,950
Ameba? Did you call me an ameba?

104
00:03:45,950 --> 00:03:47,140
You should do this here.

105
00:03:47,140 --> 00:03:49,740
Stay seated. You're number one.

106
00:03:49,740 --> 00:03:50,790
Me...

107
00:03:51,210 --> 00:03:53,790
ZICO, do you want to stand out?

108
00:03:55,180 --> 00:03:56,680
(A special stage under the spring
sun for Team Kwang Soo)

109
00:03:56,680 --> 00:03:58,620
We have something for today. Hello.

110
00:03:58,620 --> 00:03:59,800
- Hello.
- What is this?

111
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:01,200
I'm sure something's going on here.

112
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:03,600
- Hello. Are we performing today?
- There's something.

113
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:05,670
- Is it a puppet show?
- Gosh.

114
00:04:05,700 --> 00:04:06,740
- Hang on.
- There are crutches in the back.

115
00:04:06,740 --> 00:04:07,890
I just saw crutches.

116
00:04:07,890 --> 00:04:09,510
- Did you see crutches? I did too.
- Where is Kwang Soo?

117
00:04:09,510 --> 00:04:10,570
- Kwang Soo, come on out.
- Kwang Soo's in the back.

118
00:04:10,570 --> 00:04:12,670
- Why is he backstage?
- I see crutches here.

119
00:04:12,670 --> 00:04:14,980
- Why are crutches here?
- Kwang Soo is like our guest.

120
00:04:14,980 --> 00:04:16,870
Kwang Soo, why are you backstage?

121
00:04:16,870 --> 00:04:18,480
What's going on?

122
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:19,950
We should talk.

123
00:04:20,370 --> 00:04:22,380
- I guess he's performing.
- Can Kwang Soo...

124
00:04:22,380 --> 00:04:23,850
walk out in a cool way?

125
00:04:23,850 --> 00:04:25,990
(The black curtains open.)

126
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:27,680
- My gosh.
- What's that?

127
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:29,250
What? It's ZICO and Kwang Soo.

128
00:04:29,250 --> 00:04:31,800
- What's going on?
- What is he doing?

129
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:33,600
(Surprised)

130
00:04:34,750 --> 00:04:37,900
(What is going on?)

131
00:04:38,170 --> 00:04:39,170
What?

132
00:04:39,170 --> 00:04:40,900
- We have male guests.
- What is going on?

133
00:04:40,900 --> 00:04:42,500
- Today's guests are...
- Seong Wu.

134
00:04:42,500 --> 00:04:44,040
- so handsome.
- Why are you...

135
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:46,130
There's Lee Do Hyun too.

136
00:04:46,300 --> 00:04:48,040
- My gosh.
- She's so excited.

137
00:04:48,980 --> 00:04:50,350
Hey.

138
00:04:50,410 --> 00:04:51,410
Why is he...

139
00:04:51,410 --> 00:04:52,780
- What is he doing?
- Why are you there?

140
00:04:52,780 --> 00:04:54,310
- ZICO.
- What is Se Chan doing here?

141
00:04:54,310 --> 00:04:56,610
Se Chan and Kwang Soo,
you shouldn't be there.

142
00:04:56,610 --> 00:04:58,680
- What is going on?
- What is Se Chan doing?

143
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:01,790
(Excited)

144
00:05:02,090 --> 00:05:03,880
- We have male guests.
- Seong Wu.

145
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:05,960
- Seong Wu has a really small face.
- Male guests.

146
00:05:06,250 --> 00:05:07,990
His face is so small.

147
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:10,800
- You guys look like...
- You're loving this.

148
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:12,240
They're not even looking at us.

149
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:13,490
- Will you take a look at us?
- Aren't you talking to me?

150
00:05:13,490 --> 00:05:16,260
- Will you look at us?
- You're not talking to us at all.

151
00:05:16,260 --> 00:05:17,360
Why are you standing there?

152
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:19,340
- What are you doing there?
- What are you doing, Se Chan?

153
00:05:19,340 --> 00:05:20,370
(They're not convinced.)

154
00:05:20,370 --> 00:05:22,150
- Come out of there!
- Come out.

155
00:05:22,150 --> 00:05:23,940
- You can't be there!
- We're a team.

156
00:05:23,940 --> 00:05:25,570
- Come here.
- Let's go forward.

157
00:05:25,570 --> 00:05:26,570
We're a team.

158
00:05:26,570 --> 00:05:28,240
- Kwang Soo is walking.
- Right.

159
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:29,740
- Really?
- He's walking.

160
00:05:29,740 --> 00:05:31,350
- He's wearing socks.
- Hey.

161
00:05:31,350 --> 00:05:32,990
- Kwang Soo.
- My gosh.

162
00:05:32,990 --> 00:05:33,990
(Serious)

163
00:05:33,990 --> 00:05:35,320
You're not supposed to wear
slippers on a TV show.

164
00:05:35,320 --> 00:05:37,620
It's not a slipper. It has a heel.

165
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:39,620
- It's more like a sandal.
- All right then.

166
00:05:39,620 --> 00:05:42,420
I was very surprised
to see today's guests.

167
00:05:42,420 --> 00:05:43,620
We have good-looking guests.

168
00:05:43,620 --> 00:05:44,860
I can't believe we have male guests.

169
00:05:44,860 --> 00:05:46,540
What are the two servants
doing there?

170
00:05:46,540 --> 00:05:48,540
- Servants?
- What are squids doing...

171
00:05:48,540 --> 00:05:50,060
in this group?

172
00:05:50,060 --> 00:05:52,070
- I'm not a squid.
- He's a baby octopus.

173
00:05:52,110 --> 00:05:53,930
Se Chan, take off your jacket.

174
00:05:53,930 --> 00:05:54,940
- No.
- You're compared to him.

175
00:05:54,940 --> 00:05:56,570
Without the jacket,
he looks more like him.

176
00:05:56,570 --> 00:05:58,870
I came here dressed like this and
found out he came looking like this.

177
00:05:58,870 --> 00:06:00,070
You two are dressed alike.

178
00:06:00,070 --> 00:06:01,790
- This is driving me crazy.
- How did it happen?

179
00:06:01,790 --> 00:06:04,380
Seong Wu looks fashionable,
but your outfit looks like...

180
00:06:04,380 --> 00:06:08,160
- the uniform of "Happy Together."
- Come on.

181
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:09,360
What are you talking about?

182
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:11,050
- It's the same color.
- That's not true.

183
00:06:11,050 --> 00:06:12,600
- It's not a good color.
- Right.

184
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:14,160
It's the color you wear
at bathhouses.

185
00:06:14,990 --> 00:06:16,170
I'll introduce them to you then.

186
00:06:16,170 --> 00:06:17,360
- This is funny.
- Why do you...

187
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:19,490
- keep smiling?
- I'm so happy.

188
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:21,540
Today, So Min said...

189
00:06:21,540 --> 00:06:23,560
she's wearing light makeup.
She got ready for this.

190
00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:25,110
- I look natural.
- So Min.

191
00:06:25,870 --> 00:06:29,210
Please introduce yourself
one by one.

192
00:06:29,610 --> 00:06:32,650
Hello. I'm Actor Lee Do Hyun.

193
00:06:32,870 --> 00:06:33,870
He's handsome.

194
00:06:33,870 --> 00:06:36,110
- He has a great voice.
- I know.

195
00:06:36,110 --> 00:06:38,880
It turns out you're the one who
presented an award to Yu San Seul.

196
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:40,860
Right. When I presented the award,
you were there as Yu San Seul.

197
00:06:40,860 --> 00:06:42,920
- Really?
- You did?

198
00:06:43,990 --> 00:06:46,690
(The presenter is Do Hyun.)

199
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:48,860
Yu San Seul of "How Do You Play?"

200
00:06:48,860 --> 00:06:52,800
(He presented the Rookie
of the Year award to Yu San Seul.)

201
00:06:53,490 --> 00:06:54,690
After 27 years...

202
00:06:54,690 --> 00:06:56,910
- You were there as Yu San Seul.
- Really?

203
00:06:56,910 --> 00:06:59,930
- I was out of my mind that day.
- What a coincidence.

204
00:06:59,980 --> 00:07:04,050
On Running Man, the winner
always gets a prize.

205
00:07:04,050 --> 00:07:06,480
- That's right.
- I've always wanted to win it...

206
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:09,240
and give it to my parents
as I watched the show.

207
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:12,090
- What kind of prize?
- Like Korean beef...

208
00:07:12,220 --> 00:07:14,380
- or gold.
- I see.

209
00:07:14,380 --> 00:07:17,090
- That's right.
- The prizes have gotten better.

210
00:07:17,090 --> 00:07:18,360
We have a massage chair too.

211
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:20,400
- Do you have a massage chair?
- We have a massage chair,

212
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:22,120
a tablet PC, and everything.

213
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:23,990
- I'll try my best.
- We have great guests today.

214
00:07:23,990 --> 00:07:25,630
ZICO is here too.

215
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:28,260
It's like ZICO's Korea.

216
00:07:28,260 --> 00:07:29,930
He swept the whole country.

217
00:07:29,970 --> 00:07:31,300
(Dancing around)

218
00:07:31,870 --> 00:07:33,300
(What's going on?)

219
00:07:33,300 --> 00:07:34,740
Gosh, this is so...

220
00:07:35,050 --> 00:07:37,370
<i>- Just play any song</i>
- He's preparing for his concert.

221
00:07:37,370 --> 00:07:39,480
I should go forward like this.

222
00:07:39,480 --> 00:07:41,480
- What? It looks more like this.
- What's that?

223
00:07:41,480 --> 00:07:43,150
It's like a comedy show.

224
00:07:43,150 --> 00:07:45,490
- This is what comedians do.
- It looks like a comedy show.

225
00:07:45,490 --> 00:07:47,180
That's not what I did.

226
00:07:47,180 --> 00:07:49,380
This is what ZICO does.

227
00:07:49,620 --> 00:07:52,300
We did the "Any Song" Challenge.
Did you watch it?

228
00:07:52,300 --> 00:07:53,360
- I did.
- Did you?

229
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:55,260
- Yes.
- Cavewoman Ji Hyo did it.

230
00:07:55,260 --> 00:07:56,400
That's right. I watched it.

231
00:07:56,420 --> 00:07:58,340
We have the original artist here.

232
00:07:58,340 --> 00:07:59,540
- Ji Hyo, you should show him.
- To "Any Song,"

233
00:07:59,540 --> 00:08:01,170
- Hi.
- you should dance with him.

234
00:08:01,170 --> 00:08:03,060
It's just a random dance
to any song.

235
00:08:03,170 --> 00:08:05,000
- Ji Hyo.
- Don't worry about him...

236
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,780
and dance as you like.

237
00:08:06,840 --> 00:08:08,500
- ZICO, please stand next to her.
- ZICO.

238
00:08:08,650 --> 00:08:10,000
- Don't panic.
- Okay.

239
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,300
The original artist is finally here.

240
00:08:11,300 --> 00:08:13,350
I get to see him dance.
There he goes.

241
00:08:13,350 --> 00:08:14,780
(What would the original artist's
"Any Song"...)

242
00:08:14,780 --> 00:08:16,150
(and Cavewoman Ji Hyo's
random dance look like?)

243
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:18,750
Don't worry about her, ZICO.
Just do your dance.

244
00:08:18,750 --> 00:08:20,680
- Just mind your dance.
- Look at Ji Hyo.

245
00:08:21,790 --> 00:08:23,120
Ji Hyo, just focus on your dance.

246
00:08:23,730 --> 00:08:25,190
What?

247
00:08:25,190 --> 00:08:27,360
- Ji Hyo knows how to dance.
- She watched it.

248
00:08:28,100 --> 00:08:30,730
(What? Does she know the dance?)

249
00:08:30,730 --> 00:08:32,430
- She knows it.
- Hey.

250
00:08:32,430 --> 00:08:33,740
Don't practice it.

251
00:08:34,470 --> 00:08:36,300
- What is going on?
- What is she doing?

252
00:08:36,300 --> 00:08:37,840
- She practiced the moves.
- What?

253
00:08:37,840 --> 00:08:40,130
- What's wrong with Ji Hyo.
- She knows the moves.

254
00:08:42,040 --> 00:08:43,180
What's up with Ji Hyo?

255
00:08:43,180 --> 00:08:44,950
(Cavewoman Ji Hyo's
shocking transformation)

256
00:08:45,870 --> 00:08:47,540
She knows the moves.

257
00:08:47,540 --> 00:08:49,610
(She got out of the cave
and communicated with the world.)

258
00:08:50,220 --> 00:08:52,090
She knows how to dance.

259
00:08:52,090 --> 00:08:54,380
I'm very disappointed
in Cavewoman Ji Hyo.

260
00:08:54,380 --> 00:08:56,230
- What a bummer.
- She's too good.

261
00:08:56,280 --> 00:08:57,690
Ji Hyo, why are you so good?

262
00:08:58,620 --> 00:08:59,960
(Cavewoman Ji Hyo
finally got out of her cave.)

263
00:08:59,960 --> 00:09:01,230
I practiced the moves.

264
00:09:01,390 --> 00:09:03,490
- The cave collapsed.
- ZICO.

265
00:09:03,490 --> 00:09:05,130
- The cave gave way.
- I'm so disappointed.

266
00:09:05,130 --> 00:09:06,530
- I know.
- Ji Hyo.

267
00:09:06,530 --> 00:09:08,630
We will have this part cut for you.

268
00:09:09,810 --> 00:09:11,070
It's not funny.

269
00:09:11,070 --> 00:09:12,740
- How could you...
- We should change her nickname.

270
00:09:12,740 --> 00:09:13,940
You can't communicate
with the world...

271
00:09:13,940 --> 00:09:15,110
- Okay.
- like that.

272
00:09:15,110 --> 00:09:16,770
Now that I finished ZICO's dance,
I'll go back to the cave.

273
00:09:16,770 --> 00:09:18,540
Okay. You should do that.

274
00:09:18,850 --> 00:09:21,410
Please give ZICO a big hand.

275
00:09:21,410 --> 00:09:23,410
- ZICO.
- What?

276
00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:24,850
ZICO.

277
00:09:24,850 --> 00:09:26,220
Shut your mouth.

278
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:28,490
I can't help but look at him.

279
00:09:28,490 --> 00:09:29,880
Don't say things like that.

280
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:32,200
If you have time for that,
go change your clothes.

281
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:34,650
- I can't stand this.
- He's cute.

282
00:09:34,650 --> 00:09:37,360
Why would you do that
with your mouth?

283
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:40,240
Next up after...

284
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:41,660
- Do Hyun and ZICO,
- I'm curious.

285
00:09:41,660 --> 00:09:43,400
we have Seo Ji Hun here.

286
00:09:44,840 --> 00:09:47,500
Hello. I'm Actor Seo Ji Hun.

287
00:09:47,500 --> 00:09:49,270
- I like his voice.
- Jae Suk, Ji Hun is...

288
00:09:49,270 --> 00:09:50,680
younger than you think.

289
00:09:50,680 --> 00:09:52,320
- How old are you, Ji Hun?
- I'm 24.

290
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:53,480
Really? Only 24?

291
00:09:53,610 --> 00:09:54,640
I was really surprised.

292
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:59,250
Ji Hun, what is your
number-one concern these days?

293
00:09:59,610 --> 00:10:01,880
- I really like YUN DDan DDan.
- YUN DDan DDan?

294
00:10:01,880 --> 00:10:04,690
- You're like So Min.
- We have a fan of YUN DDan DDan.

295
00:10:04,690 --> 00:10:07,730
- I like YUN DDan DDan too.
- She's a fan of YUN DDan DDan.

296
00:10:07,790 --> 00:10:09,990
(Silent)

297
00:10:09,990 --> 00:10:11,160
It's over.

298
00:10:11,840 --> 00:10:13,990
(He gives no reply.)

299
00:10:13,990 --> 00:10:16,340
- Hey, you should say something.
- End of conversation.

300
00:10:16,340 --> 00:10:17,500
It makes me look bad.

301
00:10:17,610 --> 00:10:19,270
- Say something to her.
- The end.

302
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:21,180
"Is that so?"
You could've said that.

303
00:10:21,180 --> 00:10:22,810
You can say, "I like him too."

304
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,080
- "We have something in common."
- Just say anything.

305
00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:27,950
I don't know why everyone tries
to keep me at a distance.

306
00:10:28,540 --> 00:10:30,220
All right. The end.

307
00:10:30,220 --> 00:10:31,450
(So Min makes everyone
keep her at a distance.)

308
00:10:31,640 --> 00:10:35,430
Seong Wu is back after a long time.
It's been a long time, right?

309
00:10:35,430 --> 00:10:38,890
Yes. I haven't been on a TV show
for a long time.

310
00:10:38,890 --> 00:10:40,750
I know. You haven't been
on TV shows for a while.

311
00:10:40,790 --> 00:10:44,200
Is there a member
you've wanted to meet here?

312
00:10:45,100 --> 00:10:46,490
I...

313
00:10:46,490 --> 00:10:47,600
We're here.

314
00:10:47,700 --> 00:10:48,810
Just make yourself
comfortable and talk.

315
00:10:48,810 --> 00:10:50,070
- I wanted to meet Kwang Soo.
- Why?

316
00:10:50,070 --> 00:10:51,210
- Why?
- Could you tell us why?

317
00:10:51,210 --> 00:10:52,270
(He forces Seong Wu to say why.)

318
00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:53,810
He's very funny.

319
00:10:53,810 --> 00:10:56,540
- I met him at an award ceremony.
- That's right.

320
00:10:56,540 --> 00:10:58,510
When I met him there,

321
00:10:58,510 --> 00:11:00,450
I thought he was very humorous.

322
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:04,450
Do you remember anything
he said that day?

323
00:11:06,820 --> 00:11:08,460
Just make something up.

324
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:11,830
(He said Kwang Soo was funny,
but he doesn't remember anything.)

325
00:11:11,830 --> 00:11:14,100
- He didn't listen carefully.
- He just sighed.

326
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:16,390
- He just doesn't remember anything.
- Why would he sigh?

327
00:11:16,520 --> 00:11:17,830
The end.

328
00:11:18,430 --> 00:11:21,970
Today, we have Team Lee Kwang Soo
with good-looking members...

329
00:11:22,070 --> 00:11:24,860
and Team Ji Suk Jin
with entertainers.

330
00:11:24,860 --> 00:11:26,270
- Is he the center?
- What?

331
00:11:26,270 --> 00:11:27,530
Is Kwang Soo the center?

332
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:31,480
All members get 50 R coins
as base money at the beginning.

333
00:11:31,770 --> 00:11:33,870
50 R coins? Today's race is
about R coins.

334
00:11:33,870 --> 00:11:35,690
The team
who wins in each mission...

335
00:11:35,910 --> 00:11:37,590
will hand in 15 R coins.

336
00:11:37,590 --> 00:11:40,910
And the losing team will
hand in 20 R coins.

337
00:11:40,910 --> 00:11:44,460
And the team
with more R coins of the center...

338
00:11:44,460 --> 00:11:46,600
- will win the race.
- So it means...

339
00:11:46,730 --> 00:11:49,890
I should have more coins
in order to make our team win.

340
00:11:50,020 --> 00:11:52,470
- The coins of the center?
- I should have more coins.

341
00:11:52,470 --> 00:11:53,600
You should hand in your coins.

342
00:11:53,740 --> 00:11:56,030
The center of the winning team...

343
00:11:56,110 --> 00:11:58,530
and the top two members
with most coins will win the prize.

344
00:11:58,530 --> 00:12:00,310
- Two members?
- The center of the losing team...

345
00:12:00,310 --> 00:12:02,810
and the two members with
the least coins will get a penalty.

346
00:12:02,950 --> 00:12:05,000
I will show you
that Suk Jin will be torn...

347
00:12:05,080 --> 00:12:06,910
into pieces in our team.

348
00:12:07,140 --> 00:12:09,110
I'll show you how he'll be torn.

349
00:12:09,490 --> 00:12:10,880
I should trust my team members.

350
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:11,910
(What's the first mission
for R coins?)

351
00:12:11,910 --> 00:12:13,060
The first mission is...

352
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:14,990
Return of Unlucky Center.

353
00:12:16,190 --> 00:12:19,600
We have 30 eggs here. 20 of them
are boiled, and 10 are raw.

354
00:12:19,700 --> 00:12:21,020
10 raw eggs?

355
00:12:21,020 --> 00:12:22,330
Gosh, that's a lot.

356
00:12:22,330 --> 00:12:24,660
Each team will break 15 eggs.

357
00:12:24,660 --> 00:12:26,600
The team with less raw eggs
wins the game.

358
00:12:27,630 --> 00:12:29,630
This is Kwang Soo's trademark.

359
00:12:30,310 --> 00:12:32,080
- This is not good.
- Look at that.

360
00:12:32,080 --> 00:12:34,080
- You go first.
- You should go first.

361
00:12:34,080 --> 00:12:35,370
All right then.

362
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:38,240
- Se Chan, you go first.
- Me?

363
00:12:38,450 --> 00:12:40,240
- I'll try one first.
- Okay.

364
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:41,350
Se Chan.

365
00:12:41,990 --> 00:12:44,040
- Se Chan.
- It's good. I have a good feeling.

366
00:12:44,040 --> 00:12:45,860
- 1, 2, and...
- I think it's raw.

367
00:12:45,860 --> 00:12:47,090
1, 2, and 3.

368
00:12:47,460 --> 00:12:49,930
- Okay.
- Nice.

369
00:12:49,990 --> 00:12:51,150
He did it.

370
00:12:51,150 --> 00:12:52,620
You just succeeded,
so you can try one more time.

371
00:12:52,830 --> 00:12:54,020
I think it will break.

372
00:12:54,020 --> 00:12:55,790
- There are 10 raw eggs.
- Can I change it?

373
00:12:55,790 --> 00:12:57,860
- No, you can't.
- He says I can.

374
00:12:57,860 --> 00:12:59,840
- You can't switch.
- You can't.

375
00:12:59,840 --> 00:13:01,600
- No. It's over once you touch it.
- Once you grab it,

376
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:02,900
you can feel it.

377
00:13:02,900 --> 00:13:04,240
Can you feel it? Go ahead and try.

378
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:05,680
- Why?
- You said you can feel it.

379
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:08,310
Why are you twisting my arm?

380
00:13:08,310 --> 00:13:10,240
(You can talk to me.
Why are you twist my arm?)

381
00:13:11,370 --> 00:13:13,080
When did I twist your arm?

382
00:13:13,080 --> 00:13:16,540
At a slight tickle,
I feel pain here.

383
00:13:16,540 --> 00:13:18,220
- I didn't twist your arm.
- It must've hurt a lot.

384
00:13:18,510 --> 00:13:20,750
You should sound strong.

385
00:13:20,750 --> 00:13:22,560
- "Why are you twisting my arm?"
- Right.

386
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:24,460
- Why did you sound so gentle?
- He sounded like a little kid.

387
00:13:24,460 --> 00:13:26,100
- Did I do that?
- I'm innocent.

388
00:13:26,100 --> 00:13:27,560
You should yell at him.

389
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:30,200
(ZICO, Do Hyun, Ji Hun, and Seong Wu
has broken 12 eggs.)

390
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:32,260
Good. You did a good job.

391
00:13:32,470 --> 00:13:34,970
- Now it's Kwang Soo's turn.
- Watch carefully, guys.

392
00:13:34,970 --> 00:13:36,340
(Kwang Soo needs to break 3 eggs.)

393
00:13:36,340 --> 00:13:37,760
You'll see why he's Lee Kwang Soo.

394
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:39,710
(Watch carefully. You'll see
why he's Lee Kwang Soo.)

395
00:13:39,710 --> 00:13:41,180
- Good.
- This is a good chance.

396
00:13:41,270 --> 00:13:42,450
That's dangerous.

397
00:13:42,540 --> 00:13:43,740
- Yes!
- Gosh.

398
00:13:44,870 --> 00:13:46,480
- What's with him?
- Kwang Soo.

399
00:13:46,580 --> 00:13:47,640
This is amazing.

400
00:13:47,640 --> 00:13:49,410
Kwang Soo,
that doesn't seem like you.

401
00:13:49,410 --> 00:13:51,040
- Did you just drool?
- I did.

402
00:13:51,540 --> 00:13:53,960
- Are you that happy?
- I'm so thrilled.

403
00:13:53,960 --> 00:13:55,880
Is this what you're doing today?

404
00:13:55,880 --> 00:13:57,880
I'm sorry. I was carried away.
Just hurry.

405
00:13:58,020 --> 00:13:59,230
- He's drooling.
- No.

406
00:13:59,830 --> 00:14:01,120
- This is...
- That's dangerous.

407
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:02,930
(Did he pick a boiled egg again?)

408
00:14:02,930 --> 00:14:04,620
- I have a bad feeling.
- This is...

409
00:14:04,620 --> 00:14:06,260
(Stepping back)

410
00:14:06,260 --> 00:14:07,840
(Breaking)

411
00:14:07,840 --> 00:14:09,760
(It's not surprising
that he broke a raw egg.)

412
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:11,710
I knew it.

413
00:14:12,030 --> 00:14:13,530
(He tries one more time.)

414
00:14:13,530 --> 00:14:15,370
- That's right.
- It's okay.

415
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:17,350
- The probability isn't so bad.
- It's okay.

416
00:14:17,350 --> 00:14:18,910
- The odds are good.
- You have one left.

417
00:14:19,010 --> 00:14:21,010
- You're doing a good job.
- Is your forehead okay?

418
00:14:21,010 --> 00:14:22,950
- Kwang Soo likes this game.
- How many eggs?

419
00:14:22,950 --> 00:14:24,640
They broke eight raw eggs.

420
00:14:24,640 --> 00:14:27,280
- You broke a lot of raw eggs.
- We did a good job.

421
00:14:27,280 --> 00:14:28,780
- It's 8 out of 10.
- 8 out of 10?

422
00:14:28,780 --> 00:14:30,250
We broke 8 out of 10, right?

423
00:14:30,250 --> 00:14:31,990
- Are there 10 raw eggs?
- Right.

424
00:14:31,990 --> 00:14:33,290
Shall we begin?

425
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:34,750
I'll break two eggs without a break.

426
00:14:34,750 --> 00:14:36,260
- What's that hat?
- One...

427
00:14:36,470 --> 00:14:37,860
- "What's that hat?"
- It's funny, isn't it?

428
00:14:37,860 --> 00:14:39,470
Is it Leon's hat?

429
00:14:40,290 --> 00:14:41,440
It's 1 and 1.

430
00:14:41,740 --> 00:14:42,840
It hurts.

431
00:14:43,570 --> 00:14:44,740
Didn't it hurt?

432
00:14:45,480 --> 00:14:47,000
I love this moment
even though it hurts.

433
00:14:48,110 --> 00:14:49,500
- Enjoy it.
- I'm having a lot of fun.

434
00:14:50,110 --> 00:14:54,350
So Min looks like
she's on a spring picnic.

435
00:14:54,820 --> 00:14:56,140
So Min looks pretty today.

436
00:14:56,220 --> 00:14:58,220
It looks like a spring day.

437
00:14:58,240 --> 00:14:59,750
She looks
like a freshman in college.

438
00:14:59,860 --> 00:15:01,780
Look at her smile.

439
00:15:01,780 --> 00:15:05,700
Seriously, no one's looking at her
as you say that.

440
00:15:05,990 --> 00:15:07,430
They all are staring
into empty space.

441
00:15:07,430 --> 00:15:08,650
They only care about eggs.

442
00:15:08,650 --> 00:15:09,700
They are looking at the apartments.

443
00:15:09,700 --> 00:15:11,760
- Why are they so distracted?
- It's unbelievable.

444
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:13,240
I know I'm quite old.

445
00:15:13,740 --> 00:15:14,790
I admit it.

446
00:15:14,790 --> 00:15:16,760
So Min, just break an egg.

447
00:15:19,130 --> 00:15:20,240
(So Min is back to her job.)

448
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:21,610
She's good.
This is what you should do.

449
00:15:21,610 --> 00:15:24,080
(She broke 2 raw eggs in a row.)

450
00:15:24,080 --> 00:15:26,220
(The good-looking members
respond to the raw eggs.)

451
00:15:27,110 --> 00:15:28,580
(Ji Hyo, Jong Kook, and Jae Suk
broke eggs in turn.)

452
00:15:28,580 --> 00:15:29,690
It broke.

453
00:15:30,990 --> 00:15:33,220
- We don't know it yet.
- It's a tie.

454
00:15:33,220 --> 00:15:34,820
- How many eggs are left? 2?
- Suk Jin, there are 2.

455
00:15:34,820 --> 00:15:36,250
- There are only two.
- I should do this right.

456
00:15:36,590 --> 00:15:38,620
- Suk Jin, please.
- It has to be raw.

457
00:15:39,230 --> 00:15:41,650
(Raw)

458
00:15:41,650 --> 00:15:44,330
(What's Team Ji Suk Jin's fate?)

459
00:15:46,290 --> 00:15:48,470
(A raw egg)

460
00:15:48,470 --> 00:15:50,630
(We win!)

461
00:15:50,760 --> 00:15:52,870
- Well done.
- It's raw.

462
00:15:53,270 --> 00:15:54,810
So what's good for them?

463
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,110
- Why are you moving on so fast?
- What's the rush?

464
00:15:58,110 --> 00:15:59,180
I don't know what else to do.

465
00:15:59,180 --> 00:16:02,320
Since Team Lee Kwang Soo won,
they should hand in 15 coins.

466
00:16:02,690 --> 00:16:04,590
Team Ji Suk Jin lost,
so they should hand in 20 coins.

467
00:16:04,590 --> 00:16:06,060
It's just five more coins.

468
00:16:08,220 --> 00:16:10,330
Now each member will go
into the Cashier's office...

469
00:16:10,430 --> 00:16:12,930
and hand in R coins in the order
that the center determines.

470
00:16:12,930 --> 00:16:15,330
As I informed you earlier,
the center goes in there last...

471
00:16:15,330 --> 00:16:17,200
and return the R coins
to make up the shortage.

472
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:18,940
And the center...

473
00:16:18,940 --> 00:16:20,760
can check the remaining
R coins of the members.

474
00:16:20,860 --> 00:16:24,610
And he can point out the member
who returned least R coins.

475
00:16:25,240 --> 00:16:27,310
If the center points out the member
who handed in the fewest coins,

476
00:16:27,310 --> 00:16:30,500
the member will make up the
difference instead of the center.

477
00:16:30,640 --> 00:16:32,770
I didn't know about that.

478
00:16:32,770 --> 00:16:34,270
If he fails to single out
the betrayer,

479
00:16:34,270 --> 00:16:37,350
the center will hand in another five
coins for not believing his member.

480
00:16:38,380 --> 00:16:39,690
- If I get it wrong...
- Yes.

481
00:16:39,780 --> 00:16:41,360
When you go
into the Cashier's office,

482
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:43,960
you'll be told
the cumulative number of coins.

483
00:16:45,150 --> 00:16:47,430
- The winning team goes first.
- Okay.

484
00:16:47,430 --> 00:16:49,100
Let's make this look beautiful.

485
00:16:49,260 --> 00:16:50,360
We should do this equally.

486
00:16:50,360 --> 00:16:52,240
Three coins per person.

487
00:16:52,290 --> 00:16:53,940
Then you won't
have to return your coins.

488
00:16:53,940 --> 00:16:56,000
We should protect Kwang Soo.

489
00:16:56,070 --> 00:16:57,530
- We should.
- Right.

490
00:16:57,530 --> 00:17:00,210
- So we will hand in our coins.
- Okay.

491
00:17:00,210 --> 00:17:01,810
- Let's do this right.
- Do we need to give 20 coins?

492
00:17:01,810 --> 00:17:04,140
- We should hand in 20 coins.
- How many coins per person?

493
00:17:04,140 --> 00:17:05,640
- Let's be conscientious...
- Hand in three coins.

494
00:17:05,640 --> 00:17:06,870
Three coins per person.

495
00:17:06,870 --> 00:17:09,390
- And I'll hand in five coins.
- That would look great.

496
00:17:09,390 --> 00:17:10,990
- Let's do that.
- All right.

497
00:17:10,990 --> 00:17:12,580
- I'll hand in 3 coins.
- 3 coins.

498
00:17:12,580 --> 00:17:14,720
This is just the beginning.

499
00:17:15,390 --> 00:17:16,550
- Suk Jin.
- This is the first game.

500
00:17:16,550 --> 00:17:17,580
This is the first game.

501
00:17:17,580 --> 00:17:19,350
I can tell that
you're thinking of petty tricks.

502
00:17:19,350 --> 00:17:22,200
- Me? That's not true.
- He should single out a member.

503
00:17:22,470 --> 00:17:25,290
Even if I don't hand in my coins,
I'll be safe if he guesses wrong.

504
00:17:25,290 --> 00:17:27,990
That's why I have to
hand in three coins.

505
00:17:28,140 --> 00:17:31,500
- You go first then.
- Kwang Soo, determine the order.

506
00:17:31,940 --> 00:17:34,210
I'll call the most
reliable one first.

507
00:17:34,210 --> 00:17:35,410
Do Hyun goes first.

508
00:17:35,500 --> 00:17:36,600
- Me?
- Okay.

509
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:38,340
- Do Hyun goes first.
- Yes. I'll be right back.

510
00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:40,070
- Just three coins.
- Remember what we said.

511
00:17:40,070 --> 00:17:43,450
- I don't want anything else.
- I think they are naive and nice.

512
00:17:43,450 --> 00:17:44,740
They seem very nice.

513
00:17:44,740 --> 00:17:46,120
Can I give you my coins here?

514
00:17:46,120 --> 00:17:48,620
(Do Hyun seems quite reliable.
How many coins is he handing in?)

515
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:51,850
(He promised to give 3 coins.)

516
00:17:53,820 --> 00:17:57,430
(Do Hyun handed in 3 coins
as he promised.)

517
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:02,030
He handed some to them.

518
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:05,060
- Next up is Ji Hun.
- Okay.

519
00:18:05,260 --> 00:18:07,500
You shouldn't give them any.

520
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:10,410
How many did the person
in front of me give?

521
00:18:12,380 --> 00:18:15,310
(Do Hyun gave 3 coins.)

522
00:18:16,340 --> 00:18:18,990
(Will he keep his end
of the bargain as well?)

523
00:18:21,420 --> 00:18:23,960
(He gives 3 as well.)

524
00:18:26,050 --> 00:18:27,730
Kwang Soo will probably
suspect me, right?

525
00:18:28,230 --> 00:18:30,060
- Here.
- Take them.

526
00:18:30,060 --> 00:18:32,260
- ZICO, why are looking at me?
- Gosh.

527
00:18:32,260 --> 00:18:35,240
I can't believe you.
Isn't it a bit too early?

528
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:37,910
- Why are you looking at me?
- Isn't it a bit early?

529
00:18:37,910 --> 00:18:39,880
Kwang Soo, go.

530
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,330
Can I pick Se Chan before paying up?

531
00:18:41,330 --> 00:18:42,680
- Don't do that.
- No?

532
00:18:42,680 --> 00:18:43,770
- Just go first.
- Do I need to go first?

533
00:18:43,770 --> 00:18:44,770
You've already betrayed us.

534
00:18:44,770 --> 00:18:45,980
(He's going to check
how many coins there are.)

535
00:18:46,270 --> 00:18:48,040
(Did any of them betray the team?)

536
00:18:48,040 --> 00:18:49,040
Hello.

537
00:18:52,580 --> 00:18:54,550
(There should be
a total of 15 coins.)

538
00:18:54,550 --> 00:18:55,820
(There are 12 coins in total.
3 are missing.)

539
00:18:55,820 --> 00:18:56,850
"12"?

540
00:18:58,490 --> 00:18:59,590
"12"?

541
00:19:00,430 --> 00:19:01,730
Do I pick the suspect here?

542
00:19:01,900 --> 00:19:03,060
Or do I do it over there?

543
00:19:03,060 --> 00:19:05,170
(He can either pay for everything
or catch the traitor.)

544
00:19:07,370 --> 00:19:09,240
- Can I pick without paying up?
- Yes.

545
00:19:09,240 --> 00:19:10,240
I'll do that.

546
00:19:10,740 --> 00:19:11,740
Okay.

547
00:19:11,740 --> 00:19:12,740
(He's going to pick the traitor.)

548
00:19:12,740 --> 00:19:14,070
- Kwang Soo.
- Yes?

549
00:19:14,070 --> 00:19:15,650
How many did you give them?

550
00:19:15,800 --> 00:19:17,600
Look at his face.

551
00:19:18,680 --> 00:19:20,070
You look worked up.

552
00:19:20,070 --> 00:19:21,620
- I'm fine.
- He must've paid a lot.

553
00:19:21,620 --> 00:19:22,780
You look upset.

554
00:19:22,780 --> 00:19:26,620
There's a filthy loach among us.

555
00:19:26,620 --> 00:19:27,990
(They burst into laughter.)

556
00:19:27,990 --> 00:19:30,550
- There's one.
- I bet there are more.

557
00:19:30,630 --> 00:19:33,130
I'm going to catch him.

558
00:19:33,130 --> 00:19:34,230
- One?
- Really?

559
00:19:34,230 --> 00:19:35,730
There is one loach...

560
00:19:36,020 --> 00:19:38,320
- Is there a loach among you?
- that is ruining our team.

561
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:39,590
I can see my future in him.

562
00:19:39,590 --> 00:19:41,060
- Please pick.
- I trust you guys.

563
00:19:41,060 --> 00:19:42,140
I pick...

564
00:19:42,760 --> 00:19:46,830
(Which one of them does he think
paid the least amount?)

565
00:19:48,980 --> 00:19:50,040
Se Chan.

566
00:19:50,040 --> 00:19:52,300
(He picks Se Chan.)

567
00:19:52,650 --> 00:19:53,980
I think Se Chan paid up.

568
00:19:53,980 --> 00:19:55,270
- Goodness.
- He did.

569
00:19:55,270 --> 00:19:57,280
There's no one else to pick.

570
00:19:57,450 --> 00:19:59,990
Seong Wu looks brazen.

571
00:19:59,990 --> 00:20:01,620
- Guys like him betray easily.
- You paid?

572
00:20:01,620 --> 00:20:03,660
- Let's see the result.
- I'll tell you.

573
00:20:04,460 --> 00:20:07,050
Kwang Soo, you have...

574
00:20:08,460 --> 00:20:09,930
- failed.
- Hey.

575
00:20:09,930 --> 00:20:12,200
- See?
- Please pay five more coins.

576
00:20:12,370 --> 00:20:15,290
You'll become broke
if you trust the wrong people.

577
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:18,670
What?

578
00:20:18,710 --> 00:20:19,740
The total is...

579
00:20:19,740 --> 00:20:22,450
(Se Chan checked the total amount.)

580
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:24,180
(I should pay 3 coins.)

581
00:20:24,180 --> 00:20:25,650
(He'll pick me, then.)

582
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:29,720
(He wanted Kwang Soo
to suspect him and paid 3 coins.)

583
00:20:29,720 --> 00:20:33,350
The loach is among them!

584
00:20:33,420 --> 00:20:35,720
- It's 1 of these 3.
- I saw all of them paying.

585
00:20:35,720 --> 00:20:38,050
ZICO seemed as if
he was wrongfully accused.

586
00:20:38,050 --> 00:20:40,520
(Which one of them is the loach?)

587
00:20:40,520 --> 00:20:42,820
Kwang Soo, please pay
five more coins.

588
00:20:42,970 --> 00:20:44,320
I should've just paid three
back then.

589
00:20:45,870 --> 00:20:48,740
(He pays 5 more
for wrongfully suspecting Se Chan.)

590
00:20:49,260 --> 00:20:51,710
We'll start with our loach.

591
00:20:52,770 --> 00:20:54,680
- I'm speechless and upset.
- She'll go first.

592
00:20:54,680 --> 00:20:57,480
- She won't be able to betray us.
- I'm a scapegoat.

593
00:20:57,480 --> 00:20:59,650
The loach will go first.

594
00:20:59,650 --> 00:21:00,650
(Lady Loach goes first.)

595
00:21:02,150 --> 00:21:05,340
(Amidst everyone's suspicion,
what will she do?)

596
00:21:05,340 --> 00:21:07,080
You're already back?

597
00:21:07,080 --> 00:21:09,350
- Yes, because I paid.
- Did you not pay?

598
00:21:09,350 --> 00:21:11,490
- Really? Let me check.
- I think this is...

599
00:21:11,490 --> 00:21:13,700
- a good deal.
- I bet she paid up this time.

600
00:21:13,700 --> 00:21:14,990
- You're right.
- Because...

601
00:21:14,990 --> 00:21:17,490
- She got caught in the first round.
- Of course, I paid up.

602
00:21:17,490 --> 00:21:18,900
There's no way I wouldn't have.

603
00:21:19,090 --> 00:21:21,090
Suk Jin, you need
to watch Jae Suk.

604
00:21:21,090 --> 00:21:24,140
I bet Jae Suk will accuse me
no matter what.

605
00:21:24,760 --> 00:21:26,980
See? He's acting.

606
00:21:27,180 --> 00:21:28,440
(Exclaiming)

607
00:21:28,440 --> 00:21:30,770
Look at how awkward he looks.

608
00:21:30,840 --> 00:21:32,270
Already?

609
00:21:33,070 --> 00:21:34,220
Then...

610
00:21:35,570 --> 00:21:36,620
Here.

611
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:40,720
(Next up is Haha.)

612
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:42,050
(There's a total of 3 coins.)

613
00:21:42,050 --> 00:21:43,750
(There are only 3 coins.)

614
00:21:43,750 --> 00:21:46,230
Someone didn't pay, right?

615
00:21:46,520 --> 00:21:47,960
- Then...
- I'll...

616
00:21:47,960 --> 00:21:49,760
(Haha, Jong Kook, and Ji Hyo
have paid.)

617
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:51,370
I trust you guys.

618
00:21:51,370 --> 00:21:53,170
I hope I'll be able to smile
when I get there.

619
00:21:53,170 --> 00:21:56,170
I had no idea So Min
would do that from the get-go.

620
00:21:57,600 --> 00:21:59,770
- Goodness.
- He's driving me crazy.

621
00:21:59,770 --> 00:22:00,770
Gosh.

622
00:22:01,880 --> 00:22:03,770
My goodness.

623
00:22:03,770 --> 00:22:05,880
They've all gone insane.

624
00:22:05,880 --> 00:22:07,340
How could they do this?

625
00:22:07,540 --> 00:22:10,080
Is it that hard to pay three coins?

626
00:22:11,780 --> 00:22:14,160
I did expect some of them
to betray the team but...

627
00:22:14,160 --> 00:22:15,620
(He needs to pay all 14 coins
or pick out the traitor.)

628
00:22:17,230 --> 00:22:18,820
Gosh.

629
00:22:18,930 --> 00:22:20,660
You guys are something.

630
00:22:20,660 --> 00:22:22,320
- Suk Jin, trust me.
- Did you see?

631
00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:24,560
There is a loach among us.

632
00:22:24,560 --> 00:22:26,170
- Suk Jin.
- Catch the loach.

633
00:22:26,170 --> 00:22:27,200
- Suk Jin.
- Yes.

634
00:22:27,260 --> 00:22:28,760
Jae Suk looks thirsty.

635
00:22:29,370 --> 00:22:31,100
Will you pay up or pick the suspect?

636
00:22:31,100 --> 00:22:33,380
The latter, of course.
I'd be a fool not to.

637
00:22:33,380 --> 00:22:34,710
If you pick me,

638
00:22:34,710 --> 00:22:36,300
- that would be your mistake.
- Pick one.

639
00:22:36,300 --> 00:22:37,840
You need to trust me.

640
00:22:37,840 --> 00:22:39,570
- Jae Suk looks anxious.
- Your mouth's full.

641
00:22:39,570 --> 00:22:41,150
Look at me.

642
00:22:41,150 --> 00:22:43,620
- How many did you pay?
- I didn't know she'd betray us.

643
00:22:43,810 --> 00:22:47,080
I'll be honest. I paid two coins.

644
00:22:47,080 --> 00:22:48,160
That little...

645
00:22:48,160 --> 00:22:49,250
(I know the truth.)

646
00:22:49,250 --> 00:22:50,750
- I'm serious.
- I ought to just...

647
00:22:50,750 --> 00:22:52,730
- You paid two coins?
- Yes.

648
00:22:52,730 --> 00:22:53,930
I paid two coins.

649
00:22:54,050 --> 00:22:56,790
If the people who went first
paid the correct amount,

650
00:22:56,790 --> 00:22:58,820
- I'd be relieved.
- Hey.

651
00:22:58,820 --> 00:23:01,790
Will you only believe me
once I crack one of these open?

652
00:23:01,790 --> 00:23:04,210
- What are you doing?
- I'm innocent!

653
00:23:04,210 --> 00:23:05,870
- Goodness.
- You picked the right ones.

654
00:23:05,870 --> 00:23:07,800
- You did.
- You picked well.

655
00:23:07,800 --> 00:23:09,100
He's extremely unlucky.

656
00:23:09,100 --> 00:23:11,180
- That's strange.
- Why were all of them...

657
00:23:11,180 --> 00:23:12,840
- boiled eggs?
- None of them were raw.

658
00:23:12,840 --> 00:23:14,480
- One of them should've burst.
- I bet you paid one.

659
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:15,720
- One?
- Jae Suk too.

660
00:23:15,720 --> 00:23:17,490
I paid two!

661
00:23:17,490 --> 00:23:19,220
- I paid two!
- You're good.

662
00:23:19,310 --> 00:23:21,350
- You're good.
- You are.

663
00:23:21,350 --> 00:23:22,990
There aren't even
that many eggs left.

664
00:23:22,990 --> 00:23:24,230
Goodness.

665
00:23:24,390 --> 00:23:25,660
Why are all of them boiled?

666
00:23:25,660 --> 00:23:27,200
You should've been this lucky
during the previous game.

667
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:29,050
I can't express my innocence!

668
00:23:29,590 --> 00:23:31,320
- Goodness.
- Please pick the suspect.

669
00:23:31,320 --> 00:23:32,490
Okay.

670
00:23:32,520 --> 00:23:33,700
I think he'll get it right.

671
00:23:33,700 --> 00:23:36,170
(Will he be able
to pick out the traitor?)

672
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:38,300
- Jae Suk!
- Goodness.

673
00:23:38,300 --> 00:23:39,380
Jae Suk.

674
00:23:39,380 --> 00:23:40,680
- I think So Min...
- You're probably right.

675
00:23:40,680 --> 00:23:41,880
- paid 1 coin.
- I paid 2 coins.

676
00:23:41,880 --> 00:23:43,070
I bet she paid one.

677
00:23:43,070 --> 00:23:44,880
- You paid two?
- I'm sure she paid.

678
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:46,510
- You caught him.
- I did.

679
00:23:46,510 --> 00:23:48,720
- Suk Jin,
- I got it right.

680
00:23:48,840 --> 00:23:50,280
you have...

681
00:23:51,690 --> 00:23:52,850
- failed.
- What?

682
00:23:52,920 --> 00:23:54,220
I told you.

683
00:23:54,220 --> 00:23:55,990
- You paid?
- She...

684
00:23:56,050 --> 00:23:57,890
Why didn't you believe me?

685
00:23:57,890 --> 00:23:59,080
(Is the traitor someone else?)

686
00:24:01,430 --> 00:24:03,200
(Jae Suk paid 2 coins.)

687
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:04,320
I should do this.

688
00:24:05,130 --> 00:24:06,400
You know, right?

689
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:08,290
- She's the real culprit.
- My gosh.

690
00:24:08,590 --> 00:24:10,470
- Who didn't pay up?
- It's So Min.

691
00:24:11,300 --> 00:24:16,710
I know it looks like I'll pay three,
but I won't.

692
00:24:16,710 --> 00:24:18,150
(Ji Hyo didn't pay anything.)

693
00:24:18,150 --> 00:24:19,150
Okay.

694
00:24:20,650 --> 00:24:22,840
The first mission is over.

695
00:24:22,840 --> 00:24:24,890
Change into your uniforms
and move to the next location.

696
00:24:24,890 --> 00:24:27,350
(Both centers failed to catch
the traitors and paid more.)

697
00:24:28,460 --> 00:24:30,630
(There's a mysterious ranking list.)

698
00:24:30,630 --> 00:24:33,050
What are these photos?

699
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:35,130
You guys look so unctuous.

700
00:24:35,130 --> 00:24:37,060
That's the face Kwang Soo makes
when taking photos.

701
00:24:37,230 --> 00:24:39,230
- He raises his head.
- It's my favorite photo.

702
00:24:39,230 --> 00:24:40,470
He loves that angle.

703
00:24:40,470 --> 00:24:41,560
He poses like that
at airports abroad.

704
00:24:41,560 --> 00:24:44,170
- He likes that angle.
- It's that.

705
00:24:44,370 --> 00:24:47,440
Excuse me, but are Se Chan
and Kwang Soo in disguises?

706
00:24:47,940 --> 00:24:48,940
(They look too ugly.)

707
00:24:48,940 --> 00:24:49,980
Not at all.

708
00:24:50,040 --> 00:24:52,270
Our team is known
for being good-looking.

709
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:55,770
This mission is called
Get into Any Rankings.

710
00:24:55,770 --> 00:24:57,390
(Get into Any Rankings)

711
00:24:57,540 --> 00:24:59,620
Get into any rankings

712
00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:01,420
<i>What's the problem?</i>

713
00:25:01,420 --> 00:25:02,850
A professional company...

714
00:25:02,850 --> 00:25:06,990
has surveyed 112 individuals
in their 20s and 60s.

715
00:25:07,090 --> 00:25:08,730
I'll give you a different genre
for each round.

716
00:25:08,850 --> 00:25:12,370
Predict your rankings
after discussing among yourselves.

717
00:25:12,370 --> 00:25:15,030
Place your pieces
among the 12 rankings.

718
00:25:15,030 --> 00:25:16,760
You'll get points if you're right.

719
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:20,740
- I need to rank myself?
- Correct.

720
00:25:20,740 --> 00:25:22,030
More than one piece...

721
00:25:22,030 --> 00:25:24,150
- can be on each ranking.
- Really?

722
00:25:24,340 --> 00:25:26,680
The team that gets
the most correct rankings wins.

723
00:25:26,680 --> 00:25:29,510
You'll need to get
2 out of the 3 rounds correct.

724
00:25:29,510 --> 00:25:31,240
This is tricky.

725
00:25:31,450 --> 00:25:33,080
We don't know
how others think of us.

726
00:25:33,350 --> 00:25:35,220
- Here's the first question.
- Okay.

727
00:25:35,750 --> 00:25:38,960
We asked 112 people
in their 20s to 60s.

728
00:25:39,050 --> 00:25:40,320
"Who do you think
was the most popular..."

729
00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:41,660
"to the opposite gender
when they were young?"

730
00:25:41,660 --> 00:25:43,370
(Who do you think
was the most popular...)

731
00:25:43,370 --> 00:25:44,790
(to the opposite gender
when they were young?)

732
00:25:45,320 --> 00:25:47,330
- This is...
- This is easy.

733
00:25:47,700 --> 00:25:48,830
This is...

734
00:25:48,830 --> 00:25:51,870
- definitely me.
- Popular to the opposite gender?

735
00:25:51,870 --> 00:25:54,440
The most likely ones are over there.

736
00:25:54,440 --> 00:25:57,100
- Right.
- There's ZICO,

737
00:25:57,500 --> 00:25:59,040
Seong Wu, and more.

738
00:25:59,040 --> 00:26:00,920
The four lowest rankings
are neck and neck.

739
00:26:01,340 --> 00:26:02,950
We're definitely neck and neck.

740
00:26:02,950 --> 00:26:04,450
- That's heartbreaking.
- Four?

741
00:26:04,450 --> 00:26:06,190
Yes, four. We'll be neck and neck.

742
00:26:06,190 --> 00:26:08,160
You're right.

743
00:26:08,850 --> 00:26:09,960
When we were young?

744
00:26:09,960 --> 00:26:12,280
The age range is...

745
00:26:12,350 --> 00:26:14,230
- Too broad?
- Yes.

746
00:26:14,230 --> 00:26:16,670
- I think you and Se Chan...
- I agree.

747
00:26:16,670 --> 00:26:19,400
- will be placed higher.
- But...

748
00:26:19,400 --> 00:26:21,490
Seong Wu said something very kind.

749
00:26:21,490 --> 00:26:23,940
He said the age range
was too broad,

750
00:26:24,060 --> 00:26:27,030
so the others had
good chances as well.

751
00:26:27,270 --> 00:26:29,330
- Not at all.
- He's so kindhearted.

752
00:26:29,330 --> 00:26:31,150
- That's not what I meant.
- He said it so nicely.

753
00:26:31,150 --> 00:26:33,310
- Thanks.
- That's not what I meant.

754
00:26:33,310 --> 00:26:36,780
Since the elderly know
them two better...

755
00:26:37,040 --> 00:26:38,240
That wasn't the nuance
he gave off earlier.

756
00:26:38,540 --> 00:26:40,120
It sounded like he was saying,
"Cheer up."

757
00:26:40,120 --> 00:26:42,160
(He was pitying them.)

758
00:26:42,280 --> 00:26:43,780
- "You can do it."
- "You can do it."

759
00:26:43,780 --> 00:26:45,520
- That's what I felt.
- Not at all.

760
00:26:45,690 --> 00:26:48,250
I wasn't going to say this.

761
00:26:48,250 --> 00:26:49,670
(He suddenly interrupts them.)

762
00:26:49,670 --> 00:26:51,060
Then don't say it.

763
00:26:52,130 --> 00:26:53,370
Cut.

764
00:26:53,370 --> 00:26:56,170
It's best not to say anything
if you're hesitant.

765
00:26:56,240 --> 00:26:57,940
Let me brag about my bachelor days.

766
00:26:58,560 --> 00:27:00,480
I hope this will help.

767
00:27:01,210 --> 00:27:03,880
Someone asked for my number
on the streets.

768
00:27:03,880 --> 00:27:05,800
Did you give them
your pager number or what?

769
00:27:05,800 --> 00:27:07,070
- What?
- What did you give them back then?

770
00:27:07,070 --> 00:27:08,240
We didn't even have pagers.

771
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:09,620
Did you give them
your homing pigeon's name?

772
00:27:09,620 --> 00:27:12,080
(Did they exchange letters
through homing pigeons?)

773
00:27:13,050 --> 00:27:15,750
- 9999-9999?
- "9999"?

774
00:27:15,750 --> 00:27:17,850
They asked me...

775
00:27:18,050 --> 00:27:19,730
- for my number.
- Cut.

776
00:27:19,750 --> 00:27:21,930
What about you, Do Hyun?
Were you popular?

777
00:27:21,930 --> 00:27:23,470
- I bet he was.
- Do tell us.

778
00:27:23,470 --> 00:27:26,130
We need to rank ourselves.

779
00:27:26,130 --> 00:27:27,870
Back then, you had to be humble...

780
00:27:27,870 --> 00:27:29,600
- and not brag about such things.
- Right.

781
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:31,240
- But times have changed.
- Right.

782
00:27:31,240 --> 00:27:33,240
- To be honest,
- Yes, be honest.

783
00:27:33,240 --> 00:27:36,570
it was Valentine's Day
in elementary school.

784
00:27:36,570 --> 00:27:38,710
There were chocolates on my desk.

785
00:27:38,710 --> 00:27:40,720
- How much did you have?
- On your desk?

786
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:42,720
- Can I brag?
- Of course.

787
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:45,890
- You can.
- He's almost 60, and he bragged.

788
00:27:46,490 --> 00:27:48,810
My mom came to school...

789
00:27:48,810 --> 00:27:50,630
- and helped me carry them home.
- My goodness.

790
00:27:50,630 --> 00:27:52,960
This was in second grade.

791
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:54,730
Did you participate in relay races
during field day?

792
00:27:54,730 --> 00:27:56,020
- Every time.
- Goodness.

793
00:27:56,020 --> 00:27:57,370
Then there's nothing more to say.

794
00:27:57,370 --> 00:27:58,930
- I was the last runner.
- The fourth runner!

795
00:27:58,930 --> 00:28:00,030
- He was the fourth runner.
- The fourth runner?

796
00:28:00,030 --> 00:28:02,090
The fourth runner
is always the popular one.

797
00:28:02,090 --> 00:28:04,300
- Suk Jin...
- I was quite athletic.

798
00:28:04,410 --> 00:28:06,680
- Didn't you play basketball?
- In school.

799
00:28:06,680 --> 00:28:09,210
Yes, I played basketball
in high school.

800
00:28:09,710 --> 00:28:11,800
- Then girls would've liked him.
- He had to be popular.

801
00:28:11,800 --> 00:28:14,420
- Sports drinks...
- Beverages?

802
00:28:14,420 --> 00:28:15,570
Girls gave him sports drinks.

803
00:28:15,570 --> 00:28:18,010
- Yes, sports drinks.
- He reminds me...

804
00:28:18,010 --> 00:28:19,580
- of the protagonists in TV dramas.
- Right?

805
00:28:19,580 --> 00:28:21,920
We see people like him
in TV commercials too.

806
00:28:21,920 --> 00:28:22,930
Yes, by the fountain.

807
00:28:22,930 --> 00:28:24,580
Ji Hun, what about you?

808
00:28:24,580 --> 00:28:25,660
Me?

809
00:28:25,660 --> 00:28:28,460
In middle school,
after classes began,

810
00:28:28,490 --> 00:28:30,370
for about three days...

811
00:28:30,370 --> 00:28:31,760
(For 3 days after
starting middle school...)

812
00:28:32,200 --> 00:28:33,740
- Yes?
- What happened?

813
00:28:33,790 --> 00:28:36,470
Girls were lined up.

814
00:28:36,470 --> 00:28:37,470
- And...
- Just to see you?

815
00:28:37,470 --> 00:28:38,670
To get a glimpse of you?

816
00:28:38,670 --> 00:28:41,100
So that they could
cleanse their eyes!

817
00:28:41,210 --> 00:28:42,500
Girls come by
to look at handsome boys.

818
00:28:42,500 --> 00:28:44,380
I can't believe
things like that happens.

819
00:28:44,380 --> 00:28:45,710
- Exactly.
- Girls line up?

820
00:28:45,710 --> 00:28:49,010
We only thought that happened
in movies or TV dramas.

821
00:28:49,010 --> 00:28:51,040
Many went by
to get a glimpse of Se Chan too,

822
00:28:51,040 --> 00:28:52,220
but for a different reason.

823
00:28:52,220 --> 00:28:54,280
- Like coming to the zoo?
- To get a good laugh.

824
00:28:54,280 --> 00:28:55,580
- Right.
- Because they were fascinated.

825
00:28:55,580 --> 00:28:57,930
Now let's hear from ZICO.

826
00:28:57,930 --> 00:29:01,750
I wasn't a popular kid
because of my looks,

827
00:29:01,750 --> 00:29:03,590
- but retreats or...
- Exactly.

828
00:29:03,590 --> 00:29:05,670
- at school picnics.
- Because you could sing.

829
00:29:05,670 --> 00:29:07,940
After performing
in front of the other kids,

830
00:29:07,940 --> 00:29:09,400
I'd rise in fame.

831
00:29:09,400 --> 00:29:11,330
Which song did you perform to?

832
00:29:11,500 --> 00:29:14,100
"Rising Sun" by TVXQ.

833
00:29:14,100 --> 00:29:15,100
"Rising Sun"?

834
00:29:15,100 --> 00:29:17,210
Could you show us
how you performed to it?

835
00:29:17,210 --> 00:29:18,980
I don't remember anymore,

836
00:29:22,070 --> 00:29:24,220
but it was something like this.

837
00:29:24,220 --> 00:29:25,950
Well, he's such a good dancer.

838
00:29:25,950 --> 00:29:27,390
He looks cool even dancing
those small moves.

839
00:29:27,390 --> 00:29:28,850
Se Chan, how about you?

840
00:29:28,850 --> 00:29:30,390
In my case...

841
00:29:30,390 --> 00:29:31,490
How have you been lately?

842
00:29:31,490 --> 00:29:33,090
- How have I been lately?
- Are you good?

843
00:29:33,090 --> 00:29:34,850
Yes, I've been studying
to learn new things.

844
00:29:34,930 --> 00:29:38,090
I'm not kidding when I say
that in high school,

845
00:29:38,490 --> 00:29:42,140
a group of girls actually...

846
00:29:42,400 --> 00:29:44,000
fought over me.

847
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:45,000
- What?
- Why?

848
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:47,300
They liked me so much
and they all wanted me.

849
00:29:47,300 --> 00:29:48,680
- What?
- They fought over me.

850
00:29:48,680 --> 00:29:49,800
It's not a joke.

851
00:29:49,800 --> 00:29:51,740
This is the most
hilarious thing you said today.

852
00:29:51,740 --> 00:29:53,770
Really? So what happened?

853
00:29:53,770 --> 00:29:56,810
Well, the choice was mine.
I had to make a choice.

854
00:29:56,810 --> 00:29:58,490
After fighting over him,

855
00:29:58,490 --> 00:30:01,250
they came to the conclusion
that it was a draw.

856
00:30:02,120 --> 00:30:04,280
Just like we predicted,

857
00:30:04,280 --> 00:30:06,990
a lot of the members on that team
will probably be...

858
00:30:06,990 --> 00:30:07,990
- high up in the rankings.
- That's right.

859
00:30:07,990 --> 00:30:11,130
Let me tell you
one hard fact though.

860
00:30:11,130 --> 00:30:13,030
I went on my first group blind date
in high school.

861
00:30:13,030 --> 00:30:15,170
Was it in Hanyang?

862
00:30:16,090 --> 00:30:18,240
Yes, we traveled on horses
to get there.

863
00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:19,910
Where did you tie up
your horse then?

864
00:30:19,910 --> 00:30:21,380
- Your horse...
- My horse?

865
00:30:21,380 --> 00:30:22,980
- Next to Namdaemun...
- He's taking it for now.

866
00:30:22,980 --> 00:30:24,740
There were trees alongside it.

867
00:30:24,740 --> 00:30:26,510
- Trees?
- What did you do on dates?

868
00:30:26,510 --> 00:30:27,740
Shoot arrows?

869
00:30:27,740 --> 00:30:29,120
Or a game of tuho?

870
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:30,220
Don't be ridiculous.

871
00:30:30,220 --> 00:30:32,120
We just wrote down names...

872
00:30:32,120 --> 00:30:33,460
- on a paper.
- Really?

873
00:30:33,580 --> 00:30:35,220
But you would've had to
write it in Chinese characters.

874
00:30:36,220 --> 00:30:38,430
We still wrote in ancient Korean,
so don't worry.

875
00:30:38,660 --> 00:30:39,960
Ancient Korean?

876
00:30:40,230 --> 00:30:41,590
We wrote in Korean, all right?

877
00:30:41,590 --> 00:30:43,900
The Korean published
in Hunminjeongeum.

878
00:30:44,290 --> 00:30:46,200
That's what we wrote in.

879
00:30:46,200 --> 00:30:47,240
So three girls wrote your name down?

880
00:30:47,240 --> 00:30:48,590
Ji Hyo, I bet you were popular
in school.

881
00:30:48,590 --> 00:30:49,670
Of course, right?

882
00:30:49,670 --> 00:30:51,000
- Me?
- She probably was.

883
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:52,000
I bet she was popular.

884
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:54,330
I never went on group blind dates...

885
00:30:54,770 --> 00:30:57,710
and no one set me up
on blind dates either.

886
00:30:57,710 --> 00:31:00,220
Popular kids don't know
that they're popular.

887
00:31:00,220 --> 00:31:02,010
- They don't.
- Later on in life,

888
00:31:02,010 --> 00:31:03,780
you realize you were popular.

889
00:31:03,780 --> 00:31:05,840
She was a cavewoman back then too,
so of course, she didn't know.

890
00:31:05,840 --> 00:31:07,660
I never caught on to those things.

891
00:31:07,660 --> 00:31:10,690
You probably all know
Ji Hyo's photo from high school.

892
00:31:10,690 --> 00:31:12,350
The one with the slick bangs.

893
00:31:12,350 --> 00:31:14,400
It looks like
she had a temper back then.

894
00:31:14,400 --> 00:31:16,230
- Tell us how it was.
- That was me in high school.

895
00:31:16,230 --> 00:31:18,760
The middle school I attended
had some strict rules.

896
00:31:18,760 --> 00:31:20,140
Our hair had to be a short bob.

897
00:31:20,140 --> 00:31:22,290
You definitely are older
than how you look.

898
00:31:22,290 --> 00:31:24,560
- Now I'm curious.
- Is this you in middle school?

899
00:31:24,560 --> 00:31:26,000
- Yes, that.
- In middle school?

900
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:28,600
- No wonder...
- I had just been crying.

901
00:31:28,770 --> 00:31:30,880
- So there you are.
- I don't mind your hair though.

902
00:31:31,680 --> 00:31:32,740
You were pretty.

903
00:31:32,740 --> 00:31:34,120
So Min, what about you?

904
00:31:34,150 --> 00:31:36,810
Many think that
I was popular in school,

905
00:31:37,080 --> 00:31:39,540
but my mom never helped me carry
the chocolates I received.

906
00:31:39,540 --> 00:31:42,190
In fact, she helped me make...

907
00:31:42,190 --> 00:31:44,190
the chocolates I wanted to give
to the boy I like.

908
00:31:44,190 --> 00:31:45,690
I feel bad for your mom.

909
00:31:45,690 --> 00:31:47,550
- Goodness.
- She helped me make them.

910
00:31:47,550 --> 00:31:49,820
- When it comes to love...
- That's right.

911
00:31:49,820 --> 00:31:50,970
She makes sure she gets it.

912
00:31:50,970 --> 00:31:53,090
The boys that I liked...

913
00:31:53,090 --> 00:31:55,140
would like my best friends though.

914
00:31:55,140 --> 00:31:56,200
I have some sad memories.

915
00:31:56,200 --> 00:31:58,030
So that's what it was like
for So Min.

916
00:31:58,030 --> 00:32:00,570
The boys she liked
had feelings for someone else.

917
00:32:00,570 --> 00:32:02,800
- Jae Suk too.
- It was like that for me too.

918
00:32:02,800 --> 00:32:04,600
- He'd bring up the mood.
- Things would heat up,

919
00:32:04,600 --> 00:32:07,380
but the ladies would
choose my friends instead.

920
00:32:07,380 --> 00:32:09,150
Jong Kook, weren't you popular too?

921
00:32:09,150 --> 00:32:10,540
- Most definitely.
- Well,

922
00:32:10,540 --> 00:32:11,780
I...

923
00:32:11,780 --> 00:32:13,280
- Of course, he was famous.
- Older girls were more fond of me.

924
00:32:13,280 --> 00:32:15,220
That suits you though.

925
00:32:15,390 --> 00:32:17,230
Nothing can be better than that.

926
00:32:17,230 --> 00:32:19,190
There was a salon I'd go to
when I was in high school.

927
00:32:19,190 --> 00:32:20,490
- He's on a different level.
- The hairstylists?

928
00:32:20,490 --> 00:32:21,930
- The older girls there...
- The hairstylists?

929
00:32:21,930 --> 00:32:24,490
- Yes, in their early 20s.
- They were adults then.

930
00:32:24,490 --> 00:32:26,590
Yes, older girls liked me
when I was in high school.

931
00:32:26,590 --> 00:32:28,760
It's probably because
you managed the store.

932
00:32:28,760 --> 00:32:29,760
(That's why.)

933
00:32:30,100 --> 00:32:31,600
I bet you were cool back then.

934
00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:33,240
You managed salons too?

935
00:32:33,240 --> 00:32:35,140
- You managed stores?
- Really?

936
00:32:35,140 --> 00:32:37,840
- No, hold on.
- I had no idea.

937
00:32:37,840 --> 00:32:39,300
You managed the salon for them?

938
00:32:39,300 --> 00:32:41,220
- Is that what you did?
- Anyway,

939
00:32:41,220 --> 00:32:42,570
older girls were more fond of me.

940
00:32:42,570 --> 00:32:44,120
It's so believable though.

941
00:32:44,280 --> 00:32:45,390
So now...

942
00:32:45,390 --> 00:32:48,190
Yes, go ahead and predict
where you would be on the ranking.

943
00:32:48,190 --> 00:32:50,190
- Our own?
- Yes, guess your own ranking.

944
00:32:50,190 --> 00:32:52,280
Just know that we need
to win this round.

945
00:32:52,280 --> 00:32:54,090
We have to guess
our own ranking correctly.

946
00:32:54,290 --> 00:32:56,870
Most of us are probably high up.

947
00:32:56,870 --> 00:32:58,130
We're high up in the ranking.

948
00:32:58,130 --> 00:33:00,400
- But...
- Kwang Soo and I...

949
00:33:00,400 --> 00:33:02,090
- Exactly.
- We'll be low on the ranking.

950
00:33:02,090 --> 00:33:04,600
Jae Suk could be
high up in the ranking though...

951
00:33:04,600 --> 00:33:05,800
since he's funny.

952
00:33:05,800 --> 00:33:07,380
- Right?
- The funny ones...

953
00:33:07,380 --> 00:33:08,830
were popular in school.

954
00:33:08,830 --> 00:33:11,480
- I bet he's in the top three.
- Let's start with Suk Jin.

955
00:33:11,480 --> 00:33:13,000
I...

956
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:15,620
- It's all about guessing correctly.
- But Suk Jin's well-known,

957
00:33:15,620 --> 00:33:17,490
- so...
- In my case...

958
00:33:17,490 --> 00:33:19,990
Our team needs to win,
so I'll put myself in ninth place.

959
00:33:19,990 --> 00:33:21,960
You think three are beneath you
in the ranking?

960
00:33:21,960 --> 00:33:23,630
- Eighth place?
- To be honest,

961
00:33:23,960 --> 00:33:26,080
I think you're probably
in 10th place.

962
00:33:26,080 --> 00:33:27,290
Shut it.

963
00:33:27,290 --> 00:33:28,320
(Mr. Popular explodes.)

964
00:33:28,660 --> 00:33:30,490
- The choice is yours.
- I was quite popular, you know.

965
00:33:30,490 --> 00:33:31,870
Go with your gut then.

966
00:33:31,870 --> 00:33:34,530
- I was popular with the ladies.
- Go with your gut.

967
00:33:34,590 --> 00:33:36,240
- Follow your gut.
- Okay.

968
00:33:36,240 --> 00:33:37,300
(He trusts his gut...)

969
00:33:37,300 --> 00:33:38,760
(and puts himself in 7th place.)

970
00:33:38,760 --> 00:33:41,000
No, don't be like that!

971
00:33:41,100 --> 00:33:43,600
- His gut?
- You told me to follow my gut!

972
00:33:43,600 --> 00:33:45,800
- I know I said that, but...
- If I'm being honest,

973
00:33:45,800 --> 00:33:47,220
- this is where I should be.
- Stop it.

974
00:33:47,220 --> 00:33:49,740
- But your gut feeling is wrong!
- This is what my gut is telling me.

975
00:33:49,740 --> 00:33:51,340
Add a splash of conscience too.

976
00:33:51,340 --> 00:33:53,080
- Exactly.
- I'll add a lot of it.

977
00:33:53,080 --> 00:33:54,310
- Exactly.
- Add some conscience.

978
00:33:54,390 --> 00:33:55,780
- Okay!
- Nice.

979
00:33:55,780 --> 00:33:57,930
- Happy now?
- Yes, we're good.

980
00:33:57,930 --> 00:33:59,900
- Okay, fine.
- It's so that the team can win.

981
00:34:01,130 --> 00:34:02,850
Ji Hyo, don't be too modest.

982
00:34:02,850 --> 00:34:04,790
- Ji Hyo...
- Don't be modest.

983
00:34:04,790 --> 00:34:07,590
It only makes sense that
you're high up in the ranking.

984
00:34:07,590 --> 00:34:09,290
What is your take on this?

985
00:34:09,290 --> 00:34:10,640
- Me?
- Yes.

986
00:34:11,100 --> 00:34:13,000
Just be honest with us.

987
00:34:13,970 --> 00:34:15,100
First place?

988
00:34:15,100 --> 00:34:16,850
(1st place?)

989
00:34:16,850 --> 00:34:18,000
Nice one!

990
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:19,810
- Do it then.
- Put yourself in first place.

991
00:34:19,810 --> 00:34:21,220
- Go ahead.
- You should.

992
00:34:21,220 --> 00:34:22,950
- Go for first place.
- Look how brazen you are.

993
00:34:22,950 --> 00:34:24,680
I truly believe...

994
00:34:24,680 --> 00:34:26,990
- I'm in first place.
- I love that about you.

995
00:34:26,990 --> 00:34:29,490
You should do whatever you want
regardless of what others think.

996
00:34:29,560 --> 00:34:31,580
- No matter what others say...
- Regardless?

997
00:34:31,580 --> 00:34:32,660
- Be yourself.
- Go for it.

998
00:34:32,660 --> 00:34:33,930
- First place.
- Prettier kids...

999
00:34:33,930 --> 00:34:36,120
- were most popular in school.
- Right.

1000
00:34:36,290 --> 00:34:38,700
So Min is probably
high up on the ranking too.

1001
00:34:38,700 --> 00:34:39,890
So Min, just follow your gut.

1002
00:34:39,890 --> 00:34:42,470
I think I could be in third place.

1003
00:34:42,470 --> 00:34:44,830
(Laughing hysterically)

1004
00:34:44,830 --> 00:34:47,200
- Unbelievable.
- Why are you laughing?

1005
00:34:47,200 --> 00:34:49,500
- I'm pretty, you know.
- Yes, I know that.

1006
00:34:49,500 --> 00:34:51,600
(You're the only one
who doesn't know.)

1007
00:34:51,600 --> 00:34:53,140
Can't I even laugh now?

1008
00:34:53,140 --> 00:34:55,620
- "I'm pretty, you know."
- You never know though.

1009
00:34:55,620 --> 00:34:58,850
So Min was adorable as a kid,
so she was probably popular.

1010
00:34:58,850 --> 00:35:00,120
- I agree.
- Third place.

1011
00:35:00,120 --> 00:35:02,750
- I bet you were popular.
- Wouldn't second place be better?

1012
00:35:03,560 --> 00:35:06,180
I think I could be
higher in the ranking,

1013
00:35:06,180 --> 00:35:08,000
but I'll settle for this.

1014
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:09,620
Team Kwang Soo, you're up.

1015
00:35:10,020 --> 00:35:12,000
- This is a team game, guys.
- We know.

1016
00:35:12,120 --> 00:35:14,200
Let us be objective, okay?

1017
00:35:14,390 --> 00:35:16,740
Personally, I believe in you.

1018
00:35:17,140 --> 00:35:19,000
I bet you're in seconds place.

1019
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:21,370
I was quite popular
in school, you know.

1020
00:35:21,370 --> 00:35:23,410
- I bet you were.
- You're tall so...

1021
00:35:23,410 --> 00:35:25,950
- They're trying to fool you.
- I liked to joke around too.

1022
00:35:25,950 --> 00:35:27,120
This is a trap.

1023
00:35:27,120 --> 00:35:28,850
Why would you think that way?

1024
00:35:29,470 --> 00:35:31,180
Because they think
I should be high up?

1025
00:35:31,180 --> 00:35:32,950
Anyway, keep in mind
that this is a team game.

1026
00:35:32,950 --> 00:35:34,810
- You're in 2nd place.
- 2nd place sounds good.

1027
00:35:34,810 --> 00:35:36,750
- Second place sounds good.
- Where's your confidence?

1028
00:35:36,750 --> 00:35:37,990
Of course, you're in second place.

1029
00:35:38,120 --> 00:35:39,450
- Right?
- Go for it.

1030
00:35:39,450 --> 00:35:40,850
I'm not sure but...

1031
00:35:40,850 --> 00:35:42,600
You're in second place. Gosh.

1032
00:35:42,600 --> 00:35:44,000
So what?

1033
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:45,000
I'm putting myself in second place.

1034
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:46,390
He's being ridiculous.

1035
00:35:46,390 --> 00:35:48,770
The team leader has
no consideration for his team.

1036
00:35:49,370 --> 00:35:51,600
There's no one
in the lower rankings.

1037
00:35:51,600 --> 00:35:52,970
- First place.
- Seong Wu.

1038
00:35:52,970 --> 00:35:55,310
- First place!
- Don't be modest.

1039
00:35:55,310 --> 00:35:56,810
This isn't me being modest.

1040
00:35:57,970 --> 00:36:01,850
I just think that
the members of Running Man...

1041
00:36:01,850 --> 00:36:03,990
have a better chance
to be higher up in the ranking.

1042
00:36:04,080 --> 00:36:05,950
- What?
- No way!

1043
00:36:05,950 --> 00:36:09,060
If that's the case,
you'll be in ninth place.

1044
00:36:09,580 --> 00:36:11,020
- We're a group of eight.
- Not all of them.

1045
00:36:11,020 --> 00:36:12,580
- Is that so?
- Suk Jin.

1046
00:36:12,720 --> 00:36:14,100
Not you.

1047
00:36:14,100 --> 00:36:15,290
- Not you.
- Quietly but firmly...

1048
00:36:15,290 --> 00:36:17,870
I still think I'm better looking
than some of you.

1049
00:36:17,970 --> 00:36:19,000
So not me, then.

1050
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:20,290
- I'm loving your style.
- Nice one.

1051
00:36:20,290 --> 00:36:21,390
That's him being modest too.

1052
00:36:21,390 --> 00:36:23,200
You could be right though.

1053
00:36:23,600 --> 00:36:25,040
Don't forget that
you played basketball.

1054
00:36:25,040 --> 00:36:26,970
- He was actually popular in school.
- Right.

1055
00:36:26,970 --> 00:36:28,970
Do Hyun, just think about
how you really were.

1056
00:36:28,970 --> 00:36:32,200
People don't
approach me easily though...

1057
00:36:32,200 --> 00:36:35,970
because they find me
to be quite cold at first.

1058
00:36:35,970 --> 00:36:38,180
- So I wasn't...
- What's your estimate ranking?

1059
00:36:38,180 --> 00:36:41,020
Well, about 4th or 5th place?

1060
00:36:41,390 --> 00:36:43,350
That high up when
you think you weren't popular?

1061
00:36:43,350 --> 00:36:45,790
- Unbelievable.
- Are you kidding me?

1062
00:36:45,790 --> 00:36:47,750
It's right for popular kids
to say that.

1063
00:36:47,750 --> 00:36:49,620
- He's not like us.
- "About 4th or 5th?"

1064
00:36:49,700 --> 00:36:51,290
Unbelievable.

1065
00:36:51,290 --> 00:36:53,700
If we started off by saying that,

1066
00:36:53,700 --> 00:36:55,100
we would've said "below ninth."

1067
00:36:55,100 --> 00:36:56,200
I'll go for fourth place.

1068
00:36:56,200 --> 00:36:57,500
Sure, fourth place.

1069
00:36:57,500 --> 00:36:58,910
All right.

1070
00:36:58,910 --> 00:37:00,500
- Good one.
- How modest.

1071
00:37:00,500 --> 00:37:01,910
ZICO, you're next.

1072
00:37:01,910 --> 00:37:02,970
I think you'll be in first place.

1073
00:37:02,970 --> 00:37:06,040
ZICO's song has been
trending these days.

1074
00:37:06,040 --> 00:37:08,910
I'm sure everyone has heard
"Any Song" by now.

1075
00:37:09,020 --> 00:37:10,410
- Then...
- It's third place for me.

1076
00:37:10,410 --> 00:37:11,540
- Third place?
- Yes.

1077
00:37:11,540 --> 00:37:13,220
People will criticize Kwang Soo now.

1078
00:37:13,220 --> 00:37:15,350
You said you expected to be high up.

1079
00:37:15,350 --> 00:37:18,390
I can't believe you threw me
under the bus like this.

1080
00:37:18,390 --> 00:37:20,600
- But you're our team leader.
- What?

1081
00:37:20,600 --> 00:37:23,000
- You're our team leader.
- You're the worst, you know.

1082
00:37:23,500 --> 00:37:25,790
- Se Chan's up.
- He doesn't have much of a choice.

1083
00:37:25,970 --> 00:37:27,470
I'm definitely
higher up than Suk Jin.

1084
00:37:27,470 --> 00:37:29,240
- So eighth place.
- He should be beneath me.

1085
00:37:29,240 --> 00:37:31,200
His estimate isn't modest at all.

1086
00:37:31,200 --> 00:37:32,910
- Go for 8th place.
- Yes, 8th place.

1087
00:37:32,910 --> 00:37:34,500
- Right.
- It's not so bad.

1088
00:37:35,040 --> 00:37:36,240
- All right.
- Okay.

1089
00:37:37,140 --> 00:37:38,870
(Who Was Most Popular in School?)

1090
00:37:38,870 --> 00:37:40,250
So we now have the result.

1091
00:37:40,250 --> 00:37:42,720
If we put ourselves
too high up in the ranking...

1092
00:37:42,720 --> 00:37:44,540
- Tell me about it.
- I don't know...

1093
00:37:44,540 --> 00:37:47,020
who's in 12th place,
but that person should just leave.

1094
00:37:47,080 --> 00:37:48,180
- Here we go then.
- Sure.

1095
00:37:48,180 --> 00:37:49,350
Let me reveal the result.

1096
00:37:49,350 --> 00:37:50,430
One...

1097
00:37:50,490 --> 00:37:51,490
(Which team guessed
the most answers correctly?)

1098
00:37:51,490 --> 00:37:52,580
Two...

1099
00:37:52,580 --> 00:37:56,390
(Which team guessed
the most answers correctly?)

1100
00:37:56,390 --> 00:37:57,600
Three.

1101
00:37:58,020 --> 00:37:59,890
(A blast of air)

1102
00:37:59,890 --> 00:38:01,770
(Jong Kook's eyes open wide.)

1103
00:38:01,890 --> 00:38:02,930
Okay!

1104
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:04,770
- We win again!
- Again?

1105
00:38:04,910 --> 00:38:07,100
- Gosh.
- Let me show you the result.

1106
00:38:07,410 --> 00:38:08,580
- What's that?
- Here it comes.

1107
00:38:08,580 --> 00:38:09,680
- What?
- Suk Jin...

1108
00:38:09,680 --> 00:38:11,100
I got it right!

1109
00:38:11,640 --> 00:38:13,580
- I'm in 11th place. Gosh.
- I'm in 7th place.

1110
00:38:13,580 --> 00:38:15,040
- I'm in 5th place. My gosh.
- Gosh.

1111
00:38:15,120 --> 00:38:16,350
Ji Hyo, you got it right.

1112
00:38:16,350 --> 00:38:18,290
- Do Hyun is in 10th place.
- I'm in 2nd place.

1113
00:38:18,290 --> 00:38:19,910
That was close.
ZICO is in 3rd place.

1114
00:38:19,910 --> 00:38:21,620
- ZICO got it right.
- He got it right.

1115
00:38:22,060 --> 00:38:25,290
(From Team Lee Kwang Soo, ZICO
and Ji Hun got their places right.)

1116
00:38:25,290 --> 00:38:28,560
(From Team Ji Suk Jin, Ji Hyo is
the only one who got it right.)

1117
00:38:28,560 --> 00:38:29,750
(ZICO, Ji Hun, Ji Hyo)

1118
00:38:29,830 --> 00:38:30,970
Kwang Soo.

1119
00:38:31,020 --> 00:38:32,370
Kwang Soo, look at that.

1120
00:38:33,060 --> 00:38:35,040
- Kwang Soo.
- Gosh.

1121
00:38:35,040 --> 00:38:36,770
The survey wasn't done very well.

1122
00:38:36,770 --> 00:38:38,000
This is serious.

1123
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:39,430
- Do Hyun is in 10th place.
- All right.

1124
00:38:40,310 --> 00:38:41,740
Do Hyun is hilarious.

1125
00:38:41,740 --> 00:38:43,640
He guessed he'd be
in 4th or 5th place.

1126
00:38:43,640 --> 00:38:45,350
After bragging about receiving
sports drinks and everything...

1127
00:38:46,040 --> 00:38:47,410
You should never be arrogant.

1128
00:38:47,410 --> 00:38:48,750
- Do Hyun is so funny.
- You should be humble.

1129
00:38:48,750 --> 00:38:49,870
Let me explain.

1130
00:38:49,870 --> 00:38:52,450
People in their 20s cast
the most votes for ZICO.

1131
00:38:53,020 --> 00:38:54,520
- I knew it.
- But all the other age groups...

1132
00:38:54,520 --> 00:38:55,850
cast the most votes for Ji Hyo.

1133
00:38:55,850 --> 00:38:58,250
- Ji Hyo, you're incredible.
- Ji Hyo is strong.

1134
00:38:58,250 --> 00:39:01,250
Also, all the age groups cast
the fewest votes for Suk Jin.

1135
00:39:01,250 --> 00:39:02,350
(Suk Jin got the fewest votes
from all the age groups.)

1136
00:39:02,350 --> 00:39:03,700
You're below me.

1137
00:39:04,160 --> 00:39:05,770
I understand that.

1138
00:39:05,770 --> 00:39:08,370
- They don't know what I was like.
- He's angry.

1139
00:39:08,370 --> 00:39:09,470
That's understandable.

1140
00:39:09,470 --> 00:39:11,200
Okay, I get it now.
So this is how it works.

1141
00:39:11,200 --> 00:39:12,430
I get it now.

1142
00:39:12,430 --> 00:39:13,680
Here's the second question.

1143
00:39:13,770 --> 00:39:16,200
"Who would be the most boring
at clubs?"

1144
00:39:16,200 --> 00:39:19,040
(Who would be the most boring
at clubs?)

1145
00:39:19,470 --> 00:39:20,640
(I'm super fun!)

1146
00:39:20,640 --> 00:39:22,350
- Wait.
- This question...

1147
00:39:23,080 --> 00:39:24,580
For this question,

1148
00:39:24,580 --> 00:39:26,250
- I'll definitely be near the top.
- I will be in the lower ranks.

1149
00:39:26,410 --> 00:39:28,250
So fun people are supposed to be
at the bottom, right?

1150
00:39:28,250 --> 00:39:30,060
What are you guys like? Kwang Soo.

1151
00:39:30,060 --> 00:39:31,330
What do you do at clubs?

1152
00:39:31,330 --> 00:39:33,120
I'm kind of tall,

1153
00:39:33,180 --> 00:39:35,390
so I attract a lot of attention.

1154
00:39:35,750 --> 00:39:36,930
So what exactly do you do?

1155
00:39:36,930 --> 00:39:39,200
Around me...

1156
00:39:39,520 --> 00:39:41,790
Are you pretentious or frivolous?
What are you like?

1157
00:39:41,890 --> 00:39:43,470
I'm pretentious and frivolous.

1158
00:39:44,160 --> 00:39:45,270
I'm both.

1159
00:39:45,270 --> 00:39:46,770
You're pretentious and frivolous?

1160
00:39:46,770 --> 00:39:48,330
- You're P and F.
- I'm P and F.

1161
00:39:48,770 --> 00:39:50,140
You're P and F?

1162
00:39:50,140 --> 00:39:51,680
- Yes.
- You're P and F.

1163
00:39:51,870 --> 00:39:54,180
First of all, I put on...

1164
00:39:54,180 --> 00:39:56,120
all the designer clothes
I have at home and head out.

1165
00:39:56,770 --> 00:39:58,180
I want to stand out.

1166
00:39:58,490 --> 00:39:59,580
First of all...

1167
00:39:59,580 --> 00:40:01,620
"That guy is wearing
such strong perfume."

1168
00:40:01,620 --> 00:40:03,890
He wears a lot of designer clothes.

1169
00:40:04,160 --> 00:40:06,330
That's so old-fashioned.

1170
00:40:06,330 --> 00:40:08,390
It's just to send a signal
to the girls.

1171
00:40:08,390 --> 00:40:09,850
- "Here I am."
- "I'm cool."

1172
00:40:09,850 --> 00:40:11,330
- You're a show-off.
- Also,

1173
00:40:11,330 --> 00:40:13,290
if I just dance to the rhythm,

1174
00:40:13,290 --> 00:40:14,560
people don't really notice me.

1175
00:40:14,770 --> 00:40:16,560
As soon as I enter,
I shout even louder than the music.

1176
00:40:16,560 --> 00:40:18,930
(Shouting)

1177
00:40:19,830 --> 00:40:22,970
(He attracts attention by shouting
and wearing designer clothes.)

1178
00:40:22,970 --> 00:40:24,180
"Here I am!"

1179
00:40:24,180 --> 00:40:25,270
People look at me.

1180
00:40:25,270 --> 00:40:28,410
Hey, come on!

1181
00:40:28,520 --> 00:40:29,970
Here we go!

1182
00:40:29,970 --> 00:40:31,410
Let's go!

1183
00:40:31,910 --> 00:40:34,560
(He is pretentious
and old-fashioned.)

1184
00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:35,810
He shouts that at a club?

1185
00:40:36,080 --> 00:40:37,950
In the end, I'm surrounded by
about 200 people,

1186
00:40:38,080 --> 00:40:39,180
- all shouting.
- Excuse me.

1187
00:40:39,220 --> 00:40:42,000
- Excuse me. Do you work at a club?
- No.

1188
00:40:42,290 --> 00:40:44,060
- I go there to have fun.
- Do you carry things there?

1189
00:40:44,060 --> 00:40:45,830
- No, I just have fun.
- Then why do you shout...

1190
00:40:45,830 --> 00:40:47,140
It's just to get in the mood.

1191
00:40:47,140 --> 00:40:49,470
I think I've seen someone like him
in front of a club.

1192
00:40:49,560 --> 00:40:51,000
You're like me.

1193
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:52,640
- I shout a lot too.
- You should.

1194
00:40:52,770 --> 00:40:53,910
- Here we go.
- Here we go.

1195
00:40:54,040 --> 00:40:55,740
Here we go!

1196
00:40:55,740 --> 00:40:57,600
(They look like middle-aged men
after a team dinner.)

1197
00:40:58,140 --> 00:40:59,750
- That's right.
- But you two...

1198
00:40:59,750 --> 00:41:00,950
Both of you would be
near the bottom.

1199
00:41:00,950 --> 00:41:02,720
- Se Chan too.
- Then...

1200
00:41:02,850 --> 00:41:04,990
give us some music,
and we'll talk about what we do.

1201
00:41:04,990 --> 00:41:06,180
(Running Man Club is open.)

1202
00:41:06,180 --> 00:41:07,750
- It's club music.
- Kwang Soo.

1203
00:41:07,950 --> 00:41:09,020
- 1 by 1...
- I just...

1204
00:41:09,020 --> 00:41:10,660
(This is what P and F does
at a club.)

1205
00:41:12,720 --> 00:41:14,790
(He pretends to be attractive.)

1206
00:41:15,720 --> 00:41:17,620
He hasn't done this a lot.

1207
00:41:18,500 --> 00:41:19,890
- Gosh.
- I can't stand it.

1208
00:41:21,430 --> 00:41:23,500
(Do you want to dance with me?)

1209
00:41:24,770 --> 00:41:27,080
(He hits on someone
with his eyes out of focus.)

1210
00:41:27,080 --> 00:41:28,810
I've been to a club with him,
and he actually does that.

1211
00:41:29,910 --> 00:41:31,500
(Input error: You like me?)

1212
00:41:32,700 --> 00:41:34,750
(He moves his body in a weird way
while looking into space.)

1213
00:41:34,750 --> 00:41:35,970
What is this?

1214
00:41:35,970 --> 00:41:37,990
- He doesn't know how to have fun.
- Hold on.

1215
00:41:38,040 --> 00:41:39,540
- What is he doing?
- Wait.

1216
00:41:39,540 --> 00:41:40,950
- Just a second.
- What is that?

1217
00:41:41,120 --> 00:41:42,450
Excuse me. Please stop the music.

1218
00:41:42,560 --> 00:41:44,060
Who were you talking to?

1219
00:41:44,160 --> 00:41:45,890
If a girl over there notices me...

1220
00:41:45,890 --> 00:41:47,890
- Do you see ghosts?
- Why would I see ghosts?

1221
00:41:48,020 --> 00:41:49,560
- I don't see ghosts.
- Do you see ghosts?

1222
00:41:49,560 --> 00:41:51,060
I just make eye contact.

1223
00:41:51,120 --> 00:41:52,520
- Eye contact?
- Yes.

1224
00:41:52,700 --> 00:41:54,240
Do Hyun.

1225
00:41:54,740 --> 00:41:56,700
Imagine you're at a club.

1226
00:41:57,410 --> 00:41:59,270
(He enters a club.)

1227
00:41:59,500 --> 00:42:01,040
You put your hands in your pockets?

1228
00:42:02,770 --> 00:42:04,000
He's hilarious.

1229
00:42:04,970 --> 00:42:07,140
(He warms up in such a cool way.)

1230
00:42:07,140 --> 00:42:08,180
Do you really do that?

1231
00:42:08,680 --> 00:42:10,790
(His dance spirit is heating up.)

1232
00:42:10,790 --> 00:42:11,890
It's going up.

1233
00:42:11,890 --> 00:42:13,410
He's describing the build-up.

1234
00:42:13,520 --> 00:42:15,990
It's going up.

1235
00:42:15,990 --> 00:42:17,450
(His spirit is nearing its peak.)

1236
00:42:17,890 --> 00:42:18,950
(Here's the hammer dance.)

1237
00:42:19,790 --> 00:42:20,950
(Here's the hammer dance.)

1238
00:42:22,160 --> 00:42:24,390
(What kind of dance is that?)

1239
00:42:25,020 --> 00:42:28,140
(No one has ever seen
this kind of dance.)

1240
00:42:28,970 --> 00:42:30,330
(He's in the zone.)

1241
00:42:30,330 --> 00:42:33,200
- This is how I break a sweat.
- Good job.

1242
00:42:33,370 --> 00:42:35,600
- Is that what you do?
- Do Hyun, good job.

1243
00:42:35,600 --> 00:42:37,450
- ZICO.
- Let's say...

1244
00:42:37,680 --> 00:42:39,750
I like the music.

1245
00:42:41,470 --> 00:42:43,540
(Here we go.)

1246
00:42:47,680 --> 00:42:49,680
(Cute)

1247
00:42:50,830 --> 00:42:52,680
What is that?

1248
00:42:53,080 --> 00:42:54,500
What is he doing?

1249
00:42:54,500 --> 00:42:55,500
(Relaxed)

1250
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:57,720
(Oh, that's what
you're supposed to do.)

1251
00:42:58,100 --> 00:42:59,160
What is that?

1252
00:43:02,060 --> 00:43:03,930
(Amazed)

1253
00:43:05,100 --> 00:43:06,600
(The drunken fist?)

1254
00:43:07,180 --> 00:43:08,580
(Se Chan stands up.)

1255
00:43:09,600 --> 00:43:11,640
What is he doing?

1256
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:14,750
(Shouting)

1257
00:43:15,370 --> 00:43:18,720
(The shouting middle-aged man
is back in the club.)

1258
00:43:18,720 --> 00:43:20,990
(It's that man again.)

1259
00:43:22,220 --> 00:43:23,830
(Shouting and bumping)

1260
00:43:23,830 --> 00:43:25,060
Let's go! Here we go!

1261
00:43:25,060 --> 00:43:28,060
(He continues dancing
even after bumping into the table.)

1262
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:30,250
Stop it!

1263
00:43:30,250 --> 00:43:33,430
Come on!

1264
00:43:33,890 --> 00:43:35,390
- This is what I do.
- Good.

1265
00:43:35,560 --> 00:43:36,830
I like to keep the mood up.

1266
00:43:37,040 --> 00:43:38,200
What I do...

1267
00:43:38,600 --> 00:43:41,310
They all have their own styles.

1268
00:43:41,310 --> 00:43:43,970
Let's show them what we do.

1269
00:43:43,970 --> 00:43:45,640
- Suk Jin is going to be hilarious.
- Suk Jin.

1270
00:43:45,770 --> 00:43:47,910
- His dance looks funny.
- Give me some music.

1271
00:43:49,850 --> 00:43:51,850
The music suits him.
It's like at a roller-skating rink.

1272
00:43:51,850 --> 00:43:54,490
Why are you suddenly playing
this kind of music? Why?

1273
00:43:54,490 --> 00:43:56,060
You're making fun of him!

1274
00:43:56,220 --> 00:43:58,220
- What is this?
- It's okay. I like this song.

1275
00:43:58,680 --> 00:44:00,350
Isn't it "Cheri Cheri Lady"?

1276
00:44:00,350 --> 00:44:01,750
I do this for a while...

1277
00:44:01,950 --> 00:44:04,060
to get in the mood.

1278
00:44:04,060 --> 00:44:05,520
And then we do the train.

1279
00:44:05,520 --> 00:44:06,790
- What?
- We do the train.

1280
00:44:06,790 --> 00:44:08,470
- What do you mean?
- We do the train.

1281
00:44:08,770 --> 00:44:10,870
What year is this?

1282
00:44:11,470 --> 00:44:12,740
You do the train?

1283
00:44:13,660 --> 00:44:16,140
(The train never stops.)

1284
00:44:16,830 --> 00:44:18,500
We did this all the time
back in the day.

1285
00:44:19,100 --> 00:44:20,270
Everyone did.

1286
00:44:20,270 --> 00:44:22,040
(Welcome to the 80s.)

1287
00:44:23,020 --> 00:44:24,890
(We can't relate.)

1288
00:44:24,890 --> 00:44:26,080
I love this.

1289
00:44:26,220 --> 00:44:28,290
(Techno is for me.)

1290
00:44:28,290 --> 00:44:29,520
This is it.

1291
00:44:29,520 --> 00:44:32,790
(Jae Suk moves his hips to the beat
in an embarrassing way.)

1292
00:44:33,180 --> 00:44:34,950
Come on, let's go!

1293
00:44:35,430 --> 00:44:37,290
- I love this!
- Jae Suk!

1294
00:44:37,790 --> 00:44:39,890
(Shouting)

1295
00:44:39,890 --> 00:44:41,370
(Dancing)

1296
00:44:41,370 --> 00:44:42,640
They have similar styles.

1297
00:44:43,330 --> 00:44:45,560
(They start dancing as a duo.)

1298
00:44:46,240 --> 00:44:48,410
(Dancing together)

1299
00:44:48,410 --> 00:44:49,870
(ZICO can't stand it.)

1300
00:44:50,500 --> 00:44:52,540
(They're out of control.)

1301
00:44:52,540 --> 00:44:55,540
(The middle-aged men are
having the time of their lives.)

1302
00:44:56,180 --> 00:44:57,990
Jong Kook, come here.
Let's sit down.

1303
00:44:59,520 --> 00:45:01,790
(The dance turbo is on.)

1304
00:45:02,410 --> 00:45:03,580
Let's go!

1305
00:45:03,580 --> 00:45:04,620
(He minimizes movement
to prevent muscle loss.)

1306
00:45:04,620 --> 00:45:06,890
Way to go! I love it!

1307
00:45:07,500 --> 00:45:09,330
Someone take over.

1308
00:45:09,890 --> 00:45:12,100
(Here comes So Min.)

1309
00:45:14,890 --> 00:45:17,240
(She turns into
a female techno warrior.)

1310
00:45:17,700 --> 00:45:19,740
Okay!

1311
00:45:19,740 --> 00:45:21,240
(Poking)

1312
00:45:21,240 --> 00:45:22,330
Nice.

1313
00:45:22,330 --> 00:45:25,270
(Their dance reaches
the boiling point.)

1314
00:45:25,270 --> 00:45:27,770
- I love it!
- Very nice!

1315
00:45:28,620 --> 00:45:30,680
- That's what we used to do.
- That was fun.

1316
00:45:31,290 --> 00:45:34,020
- We always circle around.
- This is it.

1317
00:45:34,020 --> 00:45:35,560
- We always do the train.
- We were amazing.

1318
00:45:35,560 --> 00:45:37,330
- This is what we used to do.
- I'm dizzy.

1319
00:45:37,790 --> 00:45:39,020
That was fun.

1320
00:45:39,330 --> 00:45:41,200
- That was so fun.
- I loved it.

1321
00:45:41,200 --> 00:45:42,450
I had a blast.

1322
00:45:42,790 --> 00:45:44,620
Now, please guess your places.

1323
00:45:45,370 --> 00:45:46,660
I'm sure about Jae Suk.

1324
00:45:46,660 --> 00:45:48,640
He's definitely
in 11th or 12th place.

1325
00:45:48,640 --> 00:45:51,100
- I don't think you're at the top.
- You're in 11th place.

1326
00:45:51,830 --> 00:45:53,560
- Is 3rd place okay? Okay.
- 3rd place.

1327
00:45:54,370 --> 00:45:55,870
I think you'd be
in 3rd or 4th place.

1328
00:45:56,040 --> 00:45:57,680
- I bet Ji Hyo is in first place.
- Ji Hyo?

1329
00:45:57,680 --> 00:45:58,970
- I'd be in 1st place.
- Ji Hyo would be in 1st place.

1330
00:45:58,970 --> 00:46:01,350
- She's at the top every time.
- Ji Hyo would be in first place.

1331
00:46:01,350 --> 00:46:02,520
- Her image...
- So Min.

1332
00:46:02,520 --> 00:46:03,580
So Min would be near the top.

1333
00:46:03,580 --> 00:46:06,120
- So Min would be near the bottom.
- So Min...

1334
00:46:06,120 --> 00:46:08,120
- I'd say 10th place.
- Either 10th or 11th place.

1335
00:46:08,120 --> 00:46:09,520
Is that the image I have?

1336
00:46:09,810 --> 00:46:11,020
Do I have an image like that?

1337
00:46:11,350 --> 00:46:13,080
- We should both go here.
- Right. Both of you.

1338
00:46:13,080 --> 00:46:14,100
That might be a good strategy.

1339
00:46:14,100 --> 00:46:15,200
- Let's both go here.
- I like it.

1340
00:46:16,060 --> 00:46:18,220
(Team Ji Suk Jin is done
making their guesses.)

1341
00:46:18,520 --> 00:46:20,120
- He'd be near the bottom.
- Kwang Soo.

1342
00:46:20,120 --> 00:46:21,560
Kwang Soo, you know
you're near the bottom, right?

1343
00:46:22,290 --> 00:46:24,640
- He'd be in 7th place.
- What about 8th, 9th, or 10th?

1344
00:46:25,660 --> 00:46:27,470
- I'll go for ninth place.
- Good.

1345
00:46:27,470 --> 00:46:28,600
Ninth place.

1346
00:46:28,640 --> 00:46:29,830
That's not bad.

1347
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:31,180
I'll go for seventh place.

1348
00:46:31,870 --> 00:46:33,040
All right.

1349
00:46:33,100 --> 00:46:34,450
- That's not bad.
- That's not bad.

1350
00:46:35,140 --> 00:46:36,640
- Do Hyun...
- Do Hyun...

1351
00:46:36,640 --> 00:46:38,640
- is really boring in real life.
- He is.

1352
00:46:38,640 --> 00:46:40,990
- I'm very fun.
- You're an amazing dancer.

1353
00:46:41,160 --> 00:46:42,520
I should go here.

1354
00:46:42,520 --> 00:46:43,560
(I'm at the bottom.)

1355
00:46:43,560 --> 00:46:44,890
You're super boring.

1356
00:46:44,990 --> 00:46:46,290
Do Hyun, do whatever you want.

1357
00:46:46,290 --> 00:46:47,560
- Do you admit it?
- Of course.

1358
00:46:47,560 --> 00:46:48,700
- That I'm fun?
- Yes, of course.

1359
00:46:49,850 --> 00:46:51,970
That's where boring people go.

1360
00:46:52,120 --> 00:46:53,160
It's okay.

1361
00:46:53,220 --> 00:46:54,600
I want a prize.

1362
00:46:55,890 --> 00:46:57,160
He's so cool about it.

1363
00:46:57,160 --> 00:46:58,270
(He swallows his pride
to win a prize.)

1364
00:46:58,270 --> 00:46:59,700
You're in 12th place.

1365
00:46:59,700 --> 00:47:01,430
- You're in 12th place.
- I don't go to clubs a lot.

1366
00:47:01,430 --> 00:47:02,640
- We know that.
- We know that.

1367
00:47:02,640 --> 00:47:04,350
It's just about having a fun image.

1368
00:47:04,680 --> 00:47:06,700
- I have no choice.
- With "Any Song"...

1369
00:47:06,700 --> 00:47:07,850
- That's a good choice.
- Well done.

1370
00:47:07,850 --> 00:47:09,220
"Any Song" is so popular.

1371
00:47:10,040 --> 00:47:13,720
(Who would be the most boring
at clubs?)

1372
00:47:13,890 --> 00:47:15,790
- We have a good chance of winning.
- Will this hurt?

1373
00:47:16,160 --> 00:47:18,350
Let's win this. Let's do this.

1374
00:47:18,850 --> 00:47:20,180
Let me reveal the result.

1375
00:47:20,660 --> 00:47:22,390
1, 2, 3.

1376
00:47:22,560 --> 00:47:26,470
(What's the result?)

1377
00:47:26,470 --> 00:47:27,600
We win again!

1378
00:47:28,100 --> 00:47:31,930
(Team Lee Kwang Soo
is the final winner.)

1379
00:47:31,930 --> 00:47:33,830
- Let's see the result.
- You got it right.

1380
00:47:33,830 --> 00:47:35,200
We lose again? Why?

1381
00:47:35,200 --> 00:47:36,870
- Why did we lose?
- Why?

1382
00:47:36,870 --> 00:47:38,040
Let's see the result.

1383
00:47:38,040 --> 00:47:39,540
- What is that?
- I got it right.

1384
00:47:39,540 --> 00:47:40,810
- I got it right too.
- I got it right.

1385
00:47:40,810 --> 00:47:42,850
(The correct ranking)

1386
00:47:44,890 --> 00:47:46,680
(3 members of Team Lee Kwang Soo
got their places right...)

1387
00:47:46,680 --> 00:47:48,060
(while no member of
Team Ji Suk Jin got it right.)

1388
00:47:48,810 --> 00:47:50,390
- Do Hyun really is in 2nd place.
- I got it right.

1389
00:47:50,390 --> 00:47:51,450
He's in 2nd place?

1390
00:47:51,450 --> 00:47:52,890
Hey, you're in 2nd place.

1391
00:47:52,890 --> 00:47:54,250
(Do I look so boring?)

1392
00:47:54,700 --> 00:47:56,750
Is that my image?

1393
00:47:56,750 --> 00:47:58,470
Haha placed 11th.

1394
00:47:58,470 --> 00:48:02,370
Haha, only a few people think
you are like Sean.

1395
00:48:03,240 --> 00:48:05,470
Only your close friends think that.

1396
00:48:05,470 --> 00:48:06,640
(Only his close friends think
he is a loving husband.)

1397
00:48:06,640 --> 00:48:07,930
What do you mean Haha is like Sean?

1398
00:48:07,930 --> 00:48:09,640
He said his image is like
that of Sean.

1399
00:48:09,640 --> 00:48:10,770
What kind of nonsense is that?

1400
00:48:10,870 --> 00:48:12,140
- Seriously.
- That's ridiculous.

1401
00:48:12,140 --> 00:48:13,770
- Only my close friends think that.
- That's right.

1402
00:48:13,770 --> 00:48:16,040
- The public doesn't know that.
- No, it doesn't.

1403
00:48:17,220 --> 00:48:19,640
Thus, Team Lee Kwang Soo won.

1404
00:48:19,640 --> 00:48:21,180
(Team Lee Kwang Soo won
the 2nd round.)

1405
00:48:21,180 --> 00:48:22,450
Yes!

1406
00:48:22,720 --> 00:48:24,250
Team Lee Kwang Soo
will submit 15 R coins...

1407
00:48:24,250 --> 00:48:27,600
and Team Ji Suk Jin
will submit 20 R coins.

1408
00:48:27,750 --> 00:48:29,790
- Se Chan, go first.
- Shall I go first?

1409
00:48:29,790 --> 00:48:31,020
- Okay.
- Shall we go in this order?

1410
00:48:31,020 --> 00:48:32,890
I know Se Chan will make
the right choice.

1411
00:48:33,120 --> 00:48:35,470
Gosh, I didn't want to go first.

1412
00:48:35,470 --> 00:48:36,970
(The first person's choice
will affect everyone who follows.)

1413
00:48:36,970 --> 00:48:39,560
(What will be Se Chan's choice?)

1414
00:48:39,930 --> 00:48:41,000
- You are done, right?
- I am done.

1415
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:42,740
- ZICO, go right ahead.
- Okay.

1416
00:48:42,740 --> 00:48:44,410
ZICO, I don't doubt you.

1417
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:51,040
(Will ZICO remain loyal?)

1418
00:48:53,080 --> 00:48:55,790
Look at Ji Hun.
He is taking out R coins as he goes.

1419
00:48:56,180 --> 00:48:57,450
People who pay up are different.

1420
00:48:57,450 --> 00:49:01,390
(Seong Wu submits R coins last.)

1421
00:49:03,220 --> 00:49:04,430
(My goodness.)

1422
00:49:05,120 --> 00:49:06,600
- How many were there?
- How many did you submit?

1423
00:49:06,600 --> 00:49:08,060
How many did you submit?

1424
00:49:08,060 --> 00:49:09,060
What is it, Seong Wu?

1425
00:49:09,060 --> 00:49:11,000
- Go, Kwang Soo.
- I don't doubt you guys.

1426
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:12,060
(Is Seong Wu shocked
due to the number of R coins?)

1427
00:49:12,060 --> 00:49:13,140
If you didn't pay up...

1428
00:49:13,810 --> 00:49:16,240
I... Kwang Soo.

1429
00:49:16,580 --> 00:49:18,310
I had no choice.

1430
00:49:19,140 --> 00:49:20,950
- I had no choice either.
- I...

1431
00:49:21,810 --> 00:49:25,040
(It's time to check
the number of submitted R coins.)

1432
00:49:25,040 --> 00:49:26,390
(The current number of R coins)

1433
00:49:26,390 --> 00:49:28,790
(Only 1)

1434
00:49:29,910 --> 00:49:31,520
You jerks!

1435
00:49:32,520 --> 00:49:34,720
(He gives an angry shout.)

1436
00:49:34,720 --> 00:49:35,930
That startled me. What is it?

1437
00:49:35,930 --> 00:49:37,600
Let's break off the team.

1438
00:49:37,770 --> 00:49:39,890
- Why? What is it like?
- What is it like?

1439
00:49:39,890 --> 00:49:41,040
You know,

1440
00:49:41,270 --> 00:49:42,740
this number is ridiculous.

1441
00:49:42,740 --> 00:49:43,830
(We aren't a team.)

1442
00:49:44,540 --> 00:49:47,910
Failing to catch the traitor
would be harder.

1443
00:49:48,430 --> 00:49:50,740
- I will catch the traitor.
- How many R coins are there?

1444
00:49:50,850 --> 00:49:52,870
- Four?
- Shut it!

1445
00:49:53,270 --> 00:49:54,850
We aren't a team.

1446
00:49:54,850 --> 00:49:56,020
(He is seething
due to the shocking result.)

1447
00:49:56,020 --> 00:49:58,620
- I can't believe them.
- Well done.

1448
00:49:58,680 --> 00:49:59,910
- What a twist!
- Catch the traitor.

1449
00:49:59,910 --> 00:50:02,160
Will you pay for everything
or catch the member who paid less?

1450
00:50:02,160 --> 00:50:03,180
I will catch the traitor.

1451
00:50:03,520 --> 00:50:05,180
- I will catch the traitor.
- Please pick one.

1452
00:50:05,180 --> 00:50:06,180
(4 out of 5 members submitted
0 R coins.)

1453
00:50:06,180 --> 00:50:08,220
There are so many suspects.

1454
00:50:08,220 --> 00:50:09,350
I guess someone submitted
zero R coins.

1455
00:50:09,350 --> 00:50:11,620
I think the lowest number is
either 1 or 0.

1456
00:50:11,620 --> 00:50:14,560
I will let you defend yourself
one last time.

1457
00:50:15,060 --> 00:50:16,890
I know how many coins
Se Chan submitted.

1458
00:50:17,540 --> 00:50:19,160
- ZICO could be lying.
- So...

1459
00:50:19,640 --> 00:50:23,910
I submitted as much as Se Chan did.

1460
00:50:24,540 --> 00:50:26,080
(You little...)

1461
00:50:26,080 --> 00:50:27,100
Don't curse!

1462
00:50:27,370 --> 00:50:28,750
(A sense of betrayal
makes him curse.)

1463
00:50:28,750 --> 00:50:29,810
Don't curse!

1464
00:50:29,810 --> 00:50:31,850
There are two loaches!

1465
00:50:31,850 --> 00:50:33,850
I am sorry. I am sorry.

1466
00:50:33,850 --> 00:50:35,020
- That's not true.
- Hey!

1467
00:50:35,950 --> 00:50:37,990
- My goodness.
- Don't let him fool you.

1468
00:50:38,120 --> 00:50:40,580
Listen, Kwang Soo. Earlier...

1469
00:50:40,950 --> 00:50:43,220
- Do Hyun.
- We started off on the wrong foot.

1470
00:50:43,520 --> 00:50:45,290
- You know what I mean, right?
- For goodness' sake.

1471
00:50:45,290 --> 00:50:46,290
What did you do?

1472
00:50:46,390 --> 00:50:49,540
I had no choice but to follow.

1473
00:50:49,540 --> 00:50:51,140
(Kwang Soo is speechless.)

1474
00:50:51,140 --> 00:50:53,430
- And...
- How many coins are there in total?

1475
00:50:53,470 --> 00:50:56,310
And I saw the need
to get back on the right track.

1476
00:50:56,310 --> 00:50:58,350
- So you...
- You have an idea now, right?

1477
00:50:58,350 --> 00:50:59,850
- Are you saying you paid up?
- Yes.

1478
00:51:00,680 --> 00:51:02,970
- How many coins did you pay up?
- I can't tell you that.

1479
00:51:02,970 --> 00:51:05,410
How many coins did you pay up?
Tell me honestly.

1480
00:51:05,410 --> 00:51:06,450
No.

1481
00:51:07,680 --> 00:51:08,790
Tell me!

1482
00:51:09,060 --> 00:51:10,720
- Tell me! How many coins?
- I can't tell you.

1483
00:51:11,020 --> 00:51:13,330
I see why your mom grabbed you
by your hair.

1484
00:51:14,220 --> 00:51:16,660
- I see why your mom did it.
- I can't tell you.

1485
00:51:17,020 --> 00:51:18,930
Seong Wu can't even laugh
comfortably.

1486
00:51:18,930 --> 00:51:21,160
- I am...
- I know. He is nervous.

1487
00:51:21,160 --> 00:51:24,410
the first person...

1488
00:51:24,740 --> 00:51:27,140
who didn't follow the wrong trend.

1489
00:51:27,240 --> 00:51:28,970
- You are saying you paid up.
- Yes.

1490
00:51:30,410 --> 00:51:31,910
- He is trying his best to survive.
- Seong Wu submitted two coins.

1491
00:51:31,910 --> 00:51:32,950
Really?

1492
00:51:32,950 --> 00:51:35,470
My guess is 0, 0, 1, 1, and 2 coins.
Did I get it right?

1493
00:51:35,470 --> 00:51:38,080
- The wrong trend...
- You are close.

1494
00:51:38,450 --> 00:51:40,140
- Did I get it right?
- Kwang Soo looks upset.

1495
00:51:40,140 --> 00:51:41,450
No, no. That can't be right.

1496
00:51:41,450 --> 00:51:43,890
I wouldn't be so angry
if that's the case.

1497
00:51:44,890 --> 00:51:46,930
- Is it worse?
- Is it worse?

1498
00:51:46,930 --> 00:51:49,100
- My goodness.
- Is it worse?

1499
00:51:49,290 --> 00:51:52,100
Then you should pick anyone.

1500
00:51:52,100 --> 00:51:53,720
He should just pick one of them.

1501
00:51:53,720 --> 00:51:55,060
(Failing to catch the traitor
would be harder.)

1502
00:51:55,060 --> 00:51:56,640
This isn't a team.
For goodness' sake.

1503
00:51:57,930 --> 00:52:00,430
I will pick 1 of these 3.

1504
00:52:00,430 --> 00:52:01,970
- Okay.
- One of us?

1505
00:52:02,140 --> 00:52:03,700
I told you that we started off
on the wrong foot.

1506
00:52:03,700 --> 00:52:05,180
- Don't be ridiculous.
- You started off on the wrong foot?

1507
00:52:05,180 --> 00:52:07,270
Tell me how many coins you submitted
and I won't pick you.

1508
00:52:07,810 --> 00:52:09,410
- How many coins?
- I will whisper it in your ear.

1509
00:52:09,410 --> 00:52:10,680
I don't want the others to know.

1510
00:52:11,620 --> 00:52:13,250
He can lie, so it doesn't matter.

1511
00:52:13,250 --> 00:52:16,290
I pick Do Hyun.

1512
00:52:16,290 --> 00:52:18,120
(My goodness.)

1513
00:52:18,680 --> 00:52:19,750
I pick Do Hyun.

1514
00:52:20,080 --> 00:52:21,600
- It's you.
- Why do you think that?

1515
00:52:21,790 --> 00:52:24,250
What he whispered in my ear
makes no sense.

1516
00:52:24,250 --> 00:52:25,290
It's you.

1517
00:52:25,500 --> 00:52:27,000
- It's you. I pick Do Hyun.
- But...

1518
00:52:27,200 --> 00:52:28,890
- we started off on the wrong foot.
- Do Hyun.

1519
00:52:28,970 --> 00:52:30,370
Kwang Soo,

1520
00:52:30,470 --> 00:52:31,470
(Will Kwang Soo succeed
to apprehend the traitor?)

1521
00:52:31,470 --> 00:52:32,640
you have...

1522
00:52:36,900 --> 00:52:39,810
- successfully picked your traitor.
- Okay!

1523
00:52:39,810 --> 00:52:41,150
(Sighing)

1524
00:52:41,150 --> 00:52:42,580
- You...
- Se Chan!

1525
00:52:42,580 --> 00:52:43,980
- Seriously.
- You shouldn't be that way!

1526
00:52:43,980 --> 00:52:45,710
- What are you talking about?
- You shouldn't be that way!

1527
00:52:45,710 --> 00:52:46,770
Do Hyun,

1528
00:52:46,770 --> 00:52:48,890
go to the Cashier's office
and pay up the rest of the R coins.

1529
00:52:49,580 --> 00:52:51,750
It annoyed me that he lied.

1530
00:52:51,750 --> 00:52:53,310
Everyone submitted zero coins.

1531
00:52:54,020 --> 00:52:55,350
- For goodness' sake.
- Go.

1532
00:52:56,080 --> 00:52:58,920
(Since Do Hyun has been apprehended
as the traitor,)

1533
00:52:59,750 --> 00:53:02,870
(he submits 14 R coins.)

1534
00:53:03,270 --> 00:53:06,140
(Seong Wu was the person
who submitted 1 R coin.)

1535
00:53:06,330 --> 00:53:07,710
- Let's go.
- All right.

1536
00:53:07,710 --> 00:53:08,810
Ji Hyo should go first.

1537
00:53:08,810 --> 00:53:10,140
We need to start off
on the right foot.

1538
00:53:10,140 --> 00:53:11,230
- Ji Hyo, can you pay two R coins?
- I will...

1539
00:53:11,230 --> 00:53:12,310
- I will do that.
- Let's do this right.

1540
00:53:12,870 --> 00:53:13,870
(They submit R coins in turn.)

1541
00:53:13,870 --> 00:53:15,770
- Our total was 1 R coin.
- 1 R coin.

1542
00:53:17,100 --> 00:53:19,170
(There are 8 R coins in total.)

1543
00:53:19,170 --> 00:53:20,980
Is this a family?

1544
00:53:21,580 --> 00:53:22,620
Okay.

1545
00:53:23,310 --> 00:53:24,350
Go ahead.

1546
00:53:24,420 --> 00:53:25,580
I pick Haha.

1547
00:53:25,580 --> 00:53:26,580
(Suk Jin picks Haha.)

1548
00:53:26,580 --> 00:53:28,560
Seo Jin, you have...

1549
00:53:29,390 --> 00:53:31,290
- succeeded.
- All right.

1550
00:53:31,290 --> 00:53:33,600
Haha, pay up
the rest of the R coins.

1551
00:53:33,600 --> 00:53:37,290
(Haha had submitted 0 R coins.
He pays up 12 R coins.)

1552
00:53:37,290 --> 00:53:39,400
(The current number of R coins)

1553
00:53:39,400 --> 00:53:40,670
(Team Lee Kwang Soo
and Team Ji Suk Jin)

1554
00:53:40,730 --> 00:53:43,560
The last mission which gives you
a chance to win more R coins is...

1555
00:53:43,560 --> 00:53:45,330
Trust the Piggy Banks.

1556
00:53:45,330 --> 00:53:46,440
(Trust the Piggy Banks)

1557
00:53:46,540 --> 00:53:48,350
You will play Name Tag Elimination
for a limited amount of time.

1558
00:53:48,350 --> 00:53:49,500
(They will play Name Tag Elimination
for 30 minutes.)

1559
00:53:49,500 --> 00:53:51,480
A team member can win R coins...

1560
00:53:51,540 --> 00:53:53,350
by removing
the other team's name tags...

1561
00:53:53,520 --> 00:53:55,920
or finding and submitting
the other team's name tags...

1562
00:53:55,920 --> 00:53:57,620
to the center.

1563
00:53:58,120 --> 00:53:59,190
To the center.

1564
00:53:59,310 --> 00:54:02,230
All coins will be submitted
to the center,

1565
00:54:02,230 --> 00:54:04,620
but the center can't put them
in the piggy banks.

1566
00:54:05,330 --> 00:54:08,560
The 12 members' piggy banks
will be in the centers' room.

1567
00:54:09,100 --> 00:54:12,440
The centers must distribute coins
to the members.

1568
00:54:12,440 --> 00:54:14,140
Then those members
will enter the room...

1569
00:54:14,140 --> 00:54:16,040
and put the coins
in the piggy banks of their choice.

1570
00:54:16,900 --> 00:54:18,870
- I need to trust the team members.
- Seriously.

1571
00:54:18,870 --> 00:54:21,270
Are you out
if your name tag gets ripped off?

1572
00:54:21,270 --> 00:54:23,000
- You keep playing.
- I see.

1573
00:54:23,400 --> 00:54:25,170
The center can also win coins...

1574
00:54:25,170 --> 00:54:27,480
in the centers' room
through a separate mission.

1575
00:54:28,890 --> 00:54:30,080
Okay. I got it.

1576
00:54:30,080 --> 00:54:31,850
- Let's start the race.
- Let's go.

1577
00:54:32,250 --> 00:54:33,560
We need to win as a team.

1578
00:54:34,290 --> 00:54:36,460
(Team Ji Suk Jin has 30 coins,
Team Lee Kwang Soo has 43 coins.)

1579
00:54:36,460 --> 00:54:37,460
I need to beat Kwang Soo.

1580
00:54:37,460 --> 00:54:39,060
I think I am losing.

1581
00:54:39,920 --> 00:54:42,270
- That's right. I am winning.
- But I have Jae Suk and Jong Kook.

1582
00:54:42,520 --> 00:54:43,600
They are good at...

1583
00:54:43,600 --> 00:54:44,690
- Name Tag Elimination.
- That's right.

1584
00:54:44,690 --> 00:54:45,900
Once they bring me name tags...

1585
00:54:46,290 --> 00:54:49,170
Should I put my interest first?

1586
00:54:49,170 --> 00:54:50,770
Should I put
the team's interest first?

1587
00:54:50,940 --> 00:54:52,310
That's the question.

1588
00:54:52,310 --> 00:54:53,370
(You can avoid the penalty
if you have a lot of R coins.)

1589
00:54:53,370 --> 00:54:56,250
Okay. In this round, I plan to put
the team's interest first.

1590
00:54:56,750 --> 00:54:58,170
I should focus on...

1591
00:54:58,170 --> 00:54:59,980
finding the hidden name tags.

1592
00:54:59,980 --> 00:55:02,190
Everyone on that team
must be stronger than me.

1593
00:55:02,940 --> 00:55:05,350
I will yank off
the name tag of anyone I meet.

1594
00:55:06,120 --> 00:55:08,150
So Min, Ji Hyo...

1595
00:55:09,830 --> 00:55:12,560
I could find
my teammates' name tags...

1596
00:55:13,290 --> 00:55:14,960
and sell them for two coins each...

1597
00:55:15,060 --> 00:55:16,600
- to the other team.
- You could do that.

1598
00:55:16,600 --> 00:55:19,100
(Betrayal is engraved on his DNA.)

1599
00:55:19,440 --> 00:55:21,270
The race will start.

1600
00:55:21,560 --> 00:55:22,710
Five,

1601
00:55:22,710 --> 00:55:23,810
four,

1602
00:55:24,330 --> 00:55:25,330
three,

1603
00:55:25,670 --> 00:55:26,830
two,

1604
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:28,080
one.

1605
00:55:28,100 --> 00:55:29,500
The race starts.

1606
00:55:29,500 --> 00:55:30,710
Shall I go?

1607
00:55:31,150 --> 00:55:32,650
(The race starts!)

1608
00:55:32,650 --> 00:55:34,190
The race starts.

1609
00:55:34,420 --> 00:55:36,650
- Did it start already?
- It started.

1610
00:55:36,890 --> 00:55:39,480
The two of you will have a quiz.

1611
00:55:39,480 --> 00:55:40,520
A quiz?

1612
00:55:40,520 --> 00:55:42,480
- Listen to the question.
- I think I have an advantage.

1613
00:55:42,480 --> 00:55:43,920
You never know
if I do this seriously.

1614
00:55:43,920 --> 00:55:46,690
The center who answers
the question correctly first...

1615
00:55:46,690 --> 00:55:50,600
- will get 1 coin from the other.
- 1 coin.

1616
00:55:50,600 --> 00:55:53,690
The coins you get from the members
as well as the quiz...

1617
00:55:53,690 --> 00:55:56,330
need to go into the piggy banks.

1618
00:55:56,330 --> 00:55:58,980
So I need to give them
to my team members.

1619
00:55:58,980 --> 00:56:00,980
I should save up the coins...

1620
00:56:01,100 --> 00:56:02,100
and give them at once.

1621
00:56:02,100 --> 00:56:03,250
Who do you trust the most?

1622
00:56:03,250 --> 00:56:05,040
I trust Jong Kook the most.

1623
00:56:05,040 --> 00:56:07,370
He doesn't lie to your face.

1624
00:56:07,440 --> 00:56:09,150
I don't trust anyone but Seong Wu.

1625
00:56:10,390 --> 00:56:12,350
Your team is the absolute worst.

1626
00:56:12,560 --> 00:56:14,790
Here comes the first question.

1627
00:56:14,790 --> 00:56:18,060
- Jae Suk has a son, right?
- Yes.

1628
00:56:18,330 --> 00:56:21,290
When is Yu Ji Ho's birthday?

1629
00:56:21,290 --> 00:56:23,460
(When is Yu Ji Ho's birthday?)

1630
00:56:23,900 --> 00:56:25,790
(What kind of a question is this?)

1631
00:56:26,040 --> 00:56:28,060
(Flustered)

1632
00:56:28,440 --> 00:56:30,230
Do you think
we are Jae Suk's slaves?

1633
00:56:30,230 --> 00:56:31,330
(The ridiculous question
disheartens them.)

1634
00:56:31,330 --> 00:56:32,710
This is driving me crazy.

1635
00:56:33,440 --> 00:56:35,600
(Meanwhile, Jae Suk is looking
for name tags.)

1636
00:56:37,370 --> 00:56:38,440
(ZICO spots Jae Suk...)

1637
00:56:38,440 --> 00:56:39,540
I spotted him.

1638
00:56:39,540 --> 00:56:40,980
(and begins to chase after him.)

1639
00:56:42,290 --> 00:56:43,850
(Jae Suk is unsuspecting.)

1640
00:56:43,850 --> 00:56:46,480
- We need to find name tags.
- I know.

1641
00:56:46,480 --> 00:56:48,850
- Where can they hide...
- ZICO is behind you.

1642
00:56:48,850 --> 00:56:51,060
(He stops abruptly.)

1643
00:56:51,900 --> 00:56:53,960
(He sees Jong Kook too late.)

1644
00:56:53,960 --> 00:56:55,830
ZICO is behind you.

1645
00:56:56,290 --> 00:56:57,940
(He's shocked.)

1646
00:56:58,460 --> 00:56:59,500
- Wait for me.
- Goodness.

1647
00:56:59,500 --> 00:57:01,270
(The tables are turned.)

1648
00:57:01,270 --> 00:57:03,500
- This is so scary.
- Come here.

1649
00:57:03,500 --> 00:57:05,940
- I'm so scared.
- Come.

1650
00:57:06,770 --> 00:57:08,350
What do I do?

1651
00:57:08,350 --> 00:57:10,150
I'm sorry, ZICO.

1652
00:57:11,020 --> 00:57:12,040
No.

1653
00:57:12,040 --> 00:57:13,850
- Rip it off.
- Don't.

1654
00:57:13,850 --> 00:57:16,290
We started less than
five minutes ago.

1655
00:57:16,290 --> 00:57:19,150
You can't do this. You can't.

1656
00:57:19,150 --> 00:57:20,650
He's so funny.

1657
00:57:20,650 --> 00:57:22,120
- Don't.
- Turn around.

1658
00:57:22,120 --> 00:57:23,620
- Sorry.
- No.

1659
00:57:25,060 --> 00:57:26,330
He's so funny.

1660
00:57:26,330 --> 00:57:28,190
He ran up from behind to rip off
my name tag,

1661
00:57:28,190 --> 00:57:30,230
and then he was petrified
when he saw you.

1662
00:57:30,960 --> 00:57:32,600
(He didn't see Jong Kook.)

1663
00:57:32,600 --> 00:57:34,370
You had no idea ZICO was there.

1664
00:57:34,370 --> 00:57:37,870
- I had no idea.
- He came up so fast.

1665
00:57:37,870 --> 00:57:39,770
You had no idea ZICO was there.

1666
00:57:39,770 --> 00:57:40,770
(So Min takes the name tag
and runs away.)

1667
00:57:40,770 --> 00:57:42,150
It's my lucky day!

1668
00:57:42,580 --> 00:57:44,980
I got lucky. Thanks, Jong Kook.

1669
00:57:45,540 --> 00:57:46,920
I have to answer this
before Jae Suk gets here.

1670
00:57:46,920 --> 00:57:48,440
Let's go for it. Let me answer.

1671
00:57:48,440 --> 00:57:50,440
- August 2...
- I'm here.

1672
00:57:50,440 --> 00:57:51,960
- You're here?
- You're here already?

1673
00:57:51,960 --> 00:57:53,560
(So Min arrives at
the centers' room.)

1674
00:57:53,560 --> 00:57:55,060
Hey.

1675
00:57:55,150 --> 00:57:56,190
(Nice, So Min.)

1676
00:57:56,190 --> 00:57:57,330
Good job.

1677
00:57:57,350 --> 00:58:00,750
- Did you rip ZICO's name tag?
- No, I was there at the right time.

1678
00:58:00,750 --> 00:58:01,870
Anyhow,

1679
00:58:01,960 --> 00:58:03,120
this is the first one.

1680
00:58:03,120 --> 00:58:06,140
So Min, I'll give you coins
for the name tag.

1681
00:58:06,140 --> 00:58:07,560
- Thank you. How many are there?
- Is it three?

1682
00:58:07,560 --> 00:58:10,100
That's it? Only three?

1683
00:58:10,140 --> 00:58:12,580
If we get Ji Ho's birthday right,
we get one.

1684
00:58:12,580 --> 00:58:14,710
If he doesn't get the question
right, do we lose this?

1685
00:58:14,710 --> 00:58:15,870
- No.
- It's not like that.

1686
00:58:15,870 --> 00:58:17,940
- We keep this. Wait.
- Okay.

1687
00:58:17,940 --> 00:58:19,420
Get back out there for now.

1688
00:58:19,440 --> 00:58:20,580
- Do I leave?
- Good job.

1689
00:58:20,580 --> 00:58:22,440
No, I should put them away.

1690
00:58:22,440 --> 00:58:23,940
No, we'll collect them first.

1691
00:58:23,940 --> 00:58:25,480
- No.
- No.

1692
00:58:25,480 --> 00:58:28,190
10 seconds ago, he said
he'll never give them to you.

1693
00:58:28,390 --> 00:58:29,790
That's not true.
Our team has to win.

1694
00:58:29,790 --> 00:58:31,600
He doesn't trust you or Haha.

1695
00:58:31,600 --> 00:58:32,850
- That's not true.
- No.

1696
00:58:32,850 --> 00:58:34,670
- Leave. Our team has to win.
- I have to check.

1697
00:58:34,670 --> 00:58:36,190
- It's for the team.
- Keep playing.

1698
00:58:36,190 --> 00:58:39,460
Let me answer. August 22.

1699
00:58:39,460 --> 00:58:40,770
(August 22 is incorrect.)

1700
00:58:41,000 --> 00:58:42,440
- How am I supposed to know?
- What's the question?

1701
00:58:42,440 --> 00:58:43,460
Let me answer.

1702
00:58:43,770 --> 00:58:44,940
Kwang Soo.

1703
00:58:44,940 --> 00:58:46,140
(When is Jae Suk's son's birthday?)

1704
00:58:46,140 --> 00:58:48,440
October 28.

1705
00:58:48,440 --> 00:58:49,710
(October 28 is incorrect.)

1706
00:58:49,710 --> 00:58:50,750
(Striking)

1707
00:58:51,710 --> 00:58:53,150
(Striking)

1708
00:58:54,150 --> 00:58:55,390
You didn't hit me earlier.

1709
00:58:55,390 --> 00:58:56,420
(My answer was incorrect.)

1710
00:58:57,310 --> 00:58:58,310
(Ji Ho's birthday is the question?)

1711
00:58:58,310 --> 00:58:59,690
You lost your chance.

1712
00:59:00,120 --> 00:59:01,460
I'll help.

1713
00:59:02,020 --> 00:59:03,750
It's May 1.

1714
00:59:04,830 --> 00:59:07,960
I'm right. It was the password.

1715
00:59:07,960 --> 00:59:10,400
- Let me answer.
- Suk Jin.

1716
00:59:10,400 --> 00:59:12,230
- May...
- May?

1717
00:59:12,460 --> 00:59:13,460
(May 1)

1718
00:59:13,460 --> 00:59:15,230
- 1.
- 1?

1719
00:59:15,230 --> 00:59:17,460
(May 1 is...)

1720
00:59:17,460 --> 00:59:19,210
(correct.)

1721
00:59:19,210 --> 00:59:20,230
You're correct.

1722
00:59:21,170 --> 00:59:22,370
(He picked up Haha's answer.)

1723
00:59:22,370 --> 00:59:24,670
- Did he get it right?
- He got this right?

1724
00:59:24,670 --> 00:59:25,710
He did.

1725
00:59:25,710 --> 00:59:28,040
Suk Jin, get a coin from Kwang Soo.

1726
00:59:28,040 --> 00:59:30,120
- So I give it to you?
- Yes.

1727
00:59:30,580 --> 00:59:32,250
- I'm going to collect them...
- We have to win.

1728
00:59:32,250 --> 00:59:33,790
- and go at once.
- You have to get first place.

1729
00:59:33,790 --> 00:59:35,920
Continue your activities.
Why are you being lazy?

1730
00:59:35,920 --> 00:59:37,060
Get the name tags.

1731
00:59:37,060 --> 00:59:40,020
So I work like a dog
and give him the coins?

1732
00:59:40,020 --> 00:59:41,830
That's up to the centers.

1733
00:59:41,830 --> 00:59:43,790
I'll keep you in mind.

1734
00:59:44,060 --> 00:59:46,940
This isn't good.
It's not worth working hard.

1735
00:59:47,560 --> 00:59:49,000
This isn't looking good.

1736
00:59:49,560 --> 00:59:50,960
What's my team doing?

1737
00:59:51,330 --> 00:59:53,670
(ZICO is looking for
another chance.)

1738
00:59:54,230 --> 00:59:56,480
That scared me. She's pink.

1739
00:59:57,650 --> 00:59:58,940
That scared me.

1740
00:59:58,940 --> 01:00:00,670
- Can I pass by?
- Yes.

1741
01:00:01,250 --> 01:00:02,480
- Come here.
- Why?

1742
01:00:02,480 --> 01:00:04,460
Come here. Hurry up, punk.

1743
01:00:04,460 --> 01:00:06,420
- I can do one-on-one.
- I don't think so.

1744
01:00:07,390 --> 01:00:09,150
(He checks that she's by herself.)

1745
01:00:09,150 --> 01:00:11,830
(He starts attacking.)

1746
01:00:14,830 --> 01:00:17,460
(Why is he running away?)

1747
01:00:18,170 --> 01:00:19,870
(It's Jong Kook again!)

1748
01:00:20,190 --> 01:00:21,310
Get him.

1749
01:00:21,310 --> 01:00:23,310
(Jong Kook was waiting for him
to get close.)

1750
01:00:23,310 --> 01:00:25,080
(He strikes
when ZICO is in range.)

1751
01:00:25,080 --> 01:00:27,370
Please, Jong Kook. Please.

1752
01:00:27,370 --> 01:00:29,710
Please.

1753
01:00:29,710 --> 01:00:31,120
(Ripping)

1754
01:00:31,670 --> 01:00:34,350
Come on. What was that for?

1755
01:00:34,350 --> 01:00:36,210
- Gosh, Jong Kook.
- Do I take this?

1756
01:00:36,210 --> 01:00:38,190
Okay. Sorry, ZICO.

1757
01:00:38,420 --> 01:00:39,460
Hey.

1758
01:00:39,850 --> 01:00:41,790
Serves you right, ZICO.

1759
01:00:42,750 --> 01:00:44,330
(Jae Suk enters the centers' room.)

1760
01:00:44,330 --> 01:00:45,830
Hey. Okay.

1761
01:00:45,830 --> 01:00:47,150
- No way.
- Jae Suk.

1762
01:00:47,150 --> 01:00:49,020
- Do you...
- You have another one?

1763
01:00:49,270 --> 01:00:50,670
How many times
did ZICO get his name tag ripped?

1764
01:00:50,670 --> 01:00:51,770
ZICO and Ji Hun.

1765
01:00:51,770 --> 01:00:52,960
What's he doing?

1766
01:00:52,960 --> 01:00:54,400
(What on earth are these two doing?)

1767
01:00:55,210 --> 01:00:56,770
Why does ZICO
keep getting eliminated?

1768
01:00:56,900 --> 01:00:59,140
Give me some, and you can take this.

1769
01:00:59,170 --> 01:01:00,830
- Sure, I'll do it.
- Okay.

1770
01:01:00,830 --> 01:01:02,350
- Alright. Okay.
- Do it.

1771
01:01:02,440 --> 01:01:03,980
Let's see.

1772
01:01:03,980 --> 01:01:07,040
(2 for the captain
and 1 for each of them)

1773
01:01:07,040 --> 01:01:08,420
- Did you hear that?
- I did.

1774
01:01:08,420 --> 01:01:10,310
We almost caught up.

1775
01:01:10,650 --> 01:01:12,210
What's my team doing?

1776
01:01:12,210 --> 01:01:13,390
Jong Kook!

1777
01:01:13,810 --> 01:01:14,850
- Let's work together.
- Okay.

1778
01:01:14,850 --> 01:01:16,790
Over there!

1779
01:01:17,190 --> 01:01:19,960
(Jong Kook is bullying them.)

1780
01:01:20,000 --> 01:01:21,600
Over there!

1781
01:01:21,600 --> 01:01:23,400
(He falls like autumn leaves.)

1782
01:01:23,670 --> 01:01:25,040
He's strong.

1783
01:01:25,040 --> 01:01:26,330
- Don't come.
- Get him.

1784
01:01:26,330 --> 01:01:28,460
- Rip his name tag off.
- Go.

1785
01:01:28,460 --> 01:01:30,870
- Get his name tag.
- Don't do it.

1786
01:01:30,870 --> 01:01:32,830
- Sorry.
- Rip off Seong Wu's name tag.

1787
01:01:32,830 --> 01:01:35,400
- Get his name tag.
- Please.

1788
01:01:35,500 --> 01:01:36,850
We're sorry.

1789
01:01:36,850 --> 01:01:38,770
- Sorry.
- Wait.

1790
01:01:38,940 --> 01:01:40,920
(He gets betrayed by his team
and is eaten alive.)

1791
01:01:40,920 --> 01:01:42,120
Sorry.

1792
01:01:42,250 --> 01:01:43,290
What?

1793
01:01:43,580 --> 01:01:45,650
- Come on.
- Sorry.

1794
01:01:45,790 --> 01:01:48,190
(ZICO is back!)

1795
01:01:48,920 --> 01:01:51,960
(This is his third time trying.)

1796
01:01:51,960 --> 01:01:54,870
(He grabbed the name tag first,)

1797
01:01:54,870 --> 01:01:58,830
(but can he avoid Jong Kook?)

1798
01:01:58,830 --> 01:02:00,330
Hey.

1799
01:02:00,560 --> 01:02:01,670
Goodness.

1800
01:02:01,670 --> 01:02:04,170
(Isn't this the same face
as before?)

1801
01:02:05,580 --> 01:02:07,670
(He tried to help.)

1802
01:02:07,670 --> 01:02:08,980
(Ripping)

1803
01:02:09,670 --> 01:02:11,100
(Who are you trying to help?)

1804
01:02:11,520 --> 01:02:14,040
(He has to worry about himself.)

1805
01:02:14,440 --> 01:02:16,190
- I got another one.
- Okay.

1806
01:02:16,190 --> 01:02:17,420
- ZICO!
- What's this?

1807
01:02:18,350 --> 01:02:19,580
He didn't even get one.

1808
01:02:19,580 --> 01:02:21,580
Just hide!

1809
01:02:22,480 --> 01:02:24,150
Why is my team not coming?

1810
01:02:24,150 --> 01:02:25,560
- Hey.
- Thank you, Seong Wu.

1811
01:02:25,560 --> 01:02:27,600
- What's my team doing?
- I know.

1812
01:02:28,190 --> 01:02:29,690
(He's going around
looking for name tags.)

1813
01:02:29,690 --> 01:02:31,100
I'm first place.

1814
01:02:31,460 --> 01:02:32,870
- Se Chan.
- Jae Suk.

1815
01:02:32,870 --> 01:02:33,870
Where are you going?

1816
01:02:33,870 --> 01:02:35,100
I'm running away.

1817
01:02:36,210 --> 01:02:37,730
Do you think you can get
my name tag?

1818
01:02:38,310 --> 01:02:40,080
- Sorry?
- If we wanted to.

1819
01:02:40,080 --> 01:02:42,350
Why are you two
going around together?

1820
01:02:42,350 --> 01:02:43,350
(He's outnumbered and retreats.)

1821
01:02:43,350 --> 01:02:44,940
You scared me, ZICO.

1822
01:02:44,940 --> 01:02:45,940
(ZICO appears.)

1823
01:02:45,940 --> 01:02:48,020
- Let's get to work.
- Who are they? It's 2-on-2.

1824
01:02:48,020 --> 01:02:49,150
It's 2-on-2.

1825
01:02:49,150 --> 01:02:51,420
Let's see.

1826
01:02:51,420 --> 01:02:52,850
- I can't do it.
- Who is that?

1827
01:02:52,850 --> 01:02:54,650
- Let's run away.
- Let's go!

1828
01:02:54,650 --> 01:02:55,750
- Help me, Jae Suk.
- Hurry up.

1829
01:02:55,750 --> 01:02:57,580
They'll get me for sure.

1830
01:02:57,580 --> 01:02:59,830
ZICO, get So Min!

1831
01:02:59,850 --> 01:03:03,290
So Min, hurry up.

1832
01:03:05,330 --> 01:03:07,440
- They're after me!
- ZICO!

1833
01:03:07,690 --> 01:03:08,870
- I can't do this.
- Hurry.

1834
01:03:08,870 --> 01:03:10,870
- Go.
- Hurry.

1835
01:03:10,870 --> 01:03:12,670
- ZICO.
- Go, Jae Suk.

1836
01:03:12,670 --> 01:03:14,170
Go, Jae Suk.

1837
01:03:14,170 --> 01:03:15,600
Hey.

1838
01:03:15,600 --> 01:03:18,920
ZICO.

1839
01:03:18,940 --> 01:03:21,120
- Why is it in the front?
- ZICO.

1840
01:03:21,120 --> 01:03:22,350
Rip it, ZICO.

1841
01:03:22,350 --> 01:03:24,040
- Get her name tag.
- Hold on.

1842
01:03:24,040 --> 01:03:26,310
Get So Min's name tag, ZICO.

1843
01:03:26,310 --> 01:03:28,420
(Ji Hun joins them.)

1844
01:03:28,420 --> 01:03:30,060
Come here.

1845
01:03:30,060 --> 01:03:31,060
(Ripping)

1846
01:03:32,020 --> 01:03:34,560
(He got Jae Suk's name tag!)

1847
01:03:34,870 --> 01:03:35,960
- Good job!
- Get it.

1848
01:03:35,960 --> 01:03:38,770
- Rip it off.
- So Min.

1849
01:03:38,770 --> 01:03:40,270
Okay.

1850
01:03:40,270 --> 01:03:41,870
(They also got So Min's name tag.)

1851
01:03:41,870 --> 01:03:43,210
There were three of you.

1852
01:03:43,460 --> 01:03:44,670
Are you all right?

1853
01:03:44,670 --> 01:03:46,080
- Yes.
- ZICO.

1854
01:03:47,000 --> 01:03:49,440
Let me answer.

1855
01:03:50,710 --> 01:03:51,980
Hey, what were you doing?

1856
01:03:52,270 --> 01:03:54,580
- What were you doing?
- He's disheveled.

1857
01:03:54,580 --> 01:03:55,920
I lost three times.

1858
01:03:55,920 --> 01:03:57,540
Today's name tags were all yours.

1859
01:03:57,540 --> 01:03:58,560
Pardon?

1860
01:03:58,560 --> 01:04:00,750
It was all you.
You need to rip off name tags.

1861
01:04:00,750 --> 01:04:02,620
- I got two.
- Okay!

1862
01:04:03,420 --> 01:04:04,420
Good job!

1863
01:04:04,420 --> 01:04:05,650
He has two of So Min.

1864
01:04:05,650 --> 01:04:07,730
This is going to be
between ZICO and So Min.

1865
01:04:07,750 --> 01:04:09,190
Okay, good job.

1866
01:04:09,290 --> 01:04:11,170
- How many?
- Six coins.

1867
01:04:11,170 --> 01:04:13,330
You never know.

1868
01:04:13,330 --> 01:04:15,440
Do I have to
answer the questions right?

1869
01:04:15,440 --> 01:04:18,040
No, I give you whatever I want.

1870
01:04:18,580 --> 01:04:19,770
Do you want to go first?

1871
01:04:19,770 --> 01:04:22,080
- Where?
- Get one more. Hold on.

1872
01:04:22,080 --> 01:04:25,940
I lost three times.
It's not good to send me out there.

1873
01:04:25,940 --> 01:04:27,440
How many coins did you give up
in the first game? Be honest.

1874
01:04:27,440 --> 01:04:28,920
- Pardon?
- How many coins did you give?

1875
01:04:28,920 --> 01:04:30,250
In the first game?

1876
01:04:30,250 --> 01:04:32,650
(At the first Cashier's office,)

1877
01:04:32,650 --> 01:04:34,020
(he hesitated...)

1878
01:04:34,560 --> 01:04:37,460
(and didn't submit any coins.)

1879
01:04:37,460 --> 01:04:38,750
If I tell the truth...

1880
01:04:38,750 --> 01:04:40,560
If you tell me the truth,
I'll give some to you.

1881
01:04:40,560 --> 01:04:41,690
One.

1882
01:04:42,400 --> 01:04:43,400
Get lost.

1883
01:04:44,400 --> 01:04:45,960
(That didn't work.)

1884
01:04:46,670 --> 01:04:47,670
There's more.

1885
01:04:47,670 --> 01:04:50,060
Okay. Good job, Do Hyun.

1886
01:04:50,710 --> 01:04:52,210
- Three.
- Are you collecting them...

1887
01:04:52,210 --> 01:04:53,770
- or will you give me some?
- I'm collecting them.

1888
01:04:53,770 --> 01:04:54,870
- You are?
- Yes.

1889
01:04:54,870 --> 01:04:56,440
- Come back. Get more.
- How many are you collecting?

1890
01:04:56,580 --> 01:04:57,870
I'll have to see.

1891
01:04:57,900 --> 01:04:59,150
Wait.

1892
01:04:59,150 --> 01:05:00,310
- Don't lose hope.
- Promise me.

1893
01:05:00,310 --> 01:05:02,920
Don't lose hope.
I'll remember who got the most.

1894
01:05:02,920 --> 01:05:04,960
- Let me vote.
- Okay. Come back.

1895
01:05:04,960 --> 01:05:06,650
Jong Kook is bringing a lot.

1896
01:05:06,650 --> 01:05:07,650
It's mine.

1897
01:05:07,650 --> 01:05:09,250
- More?
- Five is for me.

1898
01:05:09,250 --> 01:05:10,560
Our team has to win.

1899
01:05:10,560 --> 01:05:12,350
- Who? So Min's? Okay.
- Keep coming.

1900
01:05:12,350 --> 01:05:13,620
Two. Great!

1901
01:05:13,750 --> 01:05:15,460
When can we submit the coins?

1902
01:05:15,460 --> 01:05:16,830
Right now,

1903
01:05:16,830 --> 01:05:18,440
I'm collecting them.

1904
01:05:18,440 --> 01:05:19,960
Se Chan, tell him you want some.

1905
01:05:19,960 --> 01:05:21,040
I want some.

1906
01:05:21,270 --> 01:05:22,600
- I want some.
- I'm collecting them.

1907
01:05:22,600 --> 01:05:24,710
I'll be honest and give you two.

1908
01:05:24,710 --> 01:05:26,270
- I'll take three. Just a few.
- Wait for it.

1909
01:05:26,270 --> 01:05:27,870
Put them down.

1910
01:05:27,870 --> 01:05:30,150
If not,
I'll let them take my name tag.

1911
01:05:30,600 --> 01:05:32,120
I'll let them take it
every 20 seconds.

1912
01:05:32,270 --> 01:05:33,850
I'm leaving. I'll show my back
every 20 seconds.

1913
01:05:33,850 --> 01:05:35,020
Hey, take my name tag.

1914
01:05:35,020 --> 01:05:36,810
- Hey, I wasn't finished talking.
- Hurry.

1915
01:05:36,810 --> 01:05:38,580
Before I let them take my name tag
every 20 seconds.

1916
01:05:38,580 --> 01:05:40,810
Give me five for now.
Are you in or not?

1917
01:05:40,810 --> 01:05:42,730
I'll keep showing my back.
Give me five.

1918
01:05:43,580 --> 01:05:46,460
I'll be honest and give you 2.
I'll take 3.

1919
01:05:46,650 --> 01:05:48,560
Three for now. This is for the team.

1920
01:05:48,560 --> 01:05:50,190
Give me 3 and take 2.

1921
01:05:50,190 --> 01:05:51,290
Fine.

1922
01:05:51,290 --> 01:05:52,370
- 3 and 2.
- Fine.

1923
01:05:52,370 --> 01:05:55,600
I don't remember seeing
Se Chan's name tag.

1924
01:05:56,370 --> 01:05:58,440
(He's finally
in the piggy bank room.)

1925
01:05:58,940 --> 01:06:01,210
- Ji Hyo is gone too.
- Hey, Ji Hyo.

1926
01:06:01,210 --> 01:06:02,850
(He doesn't do...)

1927
01:06:02,850 --> 01:06:05,480
(as promised.)

1928
01:06:05,940 --> 01:06:07,350
- Where is he?
- What was that?

1929
01:06:07,350 --> 01:06:08,420
- I'm done.
- That didn't sound right.

1930
01:06:08,420 --> 01:06:10,540
- Why?
- Why was there a pause?

1931
01:06:10,540 --> 01:06:11,560
No, it went...

1932
01:06:11,560 --> 01:06:13,560
(He's making excuses.)

1933
01:06:13,560 --> 01:06:14,560
then thud.

1934
01:06:14,650 --> 01:06:15,960
(I don't trust him.)

1935
01:06:15,960 --> 01:06:17,290
I'll get back.

1936
01:06:17,920 --> 01:06:19,690
I need to see you, Seong Wu!

1937
01:06:21,520 --> 01:06:22,920
Let's take each other's name tags.

1938
01:06:22,920 --> 01:06:24,120
- Each other's?
- Yes.

1939
01:06:24,770 --> 01:06:26,790
(Haha tries to bargain.)

1940
01:06:26,790 --> 01:06:28,330
Sure. Okay.

1941
01:06:28,500 --> 01:06:30,040
(I like this guy.)

1942
01:06:30,140 --> 01:06:31,770
Or should we rip our own and trade?

1943
01:06:31,770 --> 01:06:34,210
- You love peace.
- Right.

1944
01:06:34,210 --> 01:06:35,870
Rip them off at the same time.

1945
01:06:35,870 --> 01:06:36,980
- What?
- At the same time.

1946
01:06:36,980 --> 01:06:39,120
1, 2, 3.

1947
01:06:40,170 --> 01:06:41,310
Rip it.

1948
01:06:41,310 --> 01:06:42,350
(Glancing)

1949
01:06:43,190 --> 01:06:44,690
(Ripping)

1950
01:06:46,960 --> 01:06:48,980
(Haha puts his name tag back on.)

1951
01:06:48,980 --> 01:06:50,850
I didn't rip it off.

1952
01:06:53,190 --> 01:06:55,170
What is this?

1953
01:06:55,400 --> 01:06:57,870
- What?
- You ripped off your name tag.

1954
01:06:57,870 --> 01:06:59,000
Give it to me.

1955
01:06:59,000 --> 01:07:00,440
Rip off your name tag.

1956
01:07:01,400 --> 01:07:03,770
I didn't know
you would do it so fast.

1957
01:07:03,900 --> 01:07:05,100
Give it to me.

1958
01:07:05,100 --> 01:07:06,640
I am a busy man, Seong Wu.

1959
01:07:06,730 --> 01:07:09,170
I am sorry, okay?

1960
01:07:09,170 --> 01:07:10,650
- I will get going now.
- Can't I rip off his name tag now?

1961
01:07:10,650 --> 01:07:11,850
You can't do that
when your name tag is ripped off.

1962
01:07:11,850 --> 01:07:13,670
You are the man. Seriously.

1963
01:07:14,270 --> 01:07:15,540
(Meanwhile, Jong Kook is looking
for name tags.)

1964
01:07:15,540 --> 01:07:16,810
Where could they be?

1965
01:07:17,690 --> 01:07:19,210
(Trailing behind him...)

1966
01:07:19,210 --> 01:07:22,190
(is Do Hyun.)

1967
01:07:22,890 --> 01:07:25,290
(He holds his breath...)

1968
01:07:25,290 --> 01:07:27,920
(and chases after Jong Kook!)

1969
01:07:28,670 --> 01:07:29,900
(Waiting for his chance)

1970
01:07:29,900 --> 01:07:31,960
They used to hide name tags in here.

1971
01:07:31,960 --> 01:07:34,270
(Jong Kook was looking
for name tags...)

1972
01:07:34,270 --> 01:07:35,440
My goodness.

1973
01:07:36,370 --> 01:07:38,400
(when he spots Do Hyun.)

1974
01:07:38,710 --> 01:07:40,230
I didn't expect you to look back.

1975
01:07:41,140 --> 01:07:42,940
You should have walked over faster.

1976
01:07:43,540 --> 01:07:45,370
You grew up watching
Running Man, right?

1977
01:07:45,370 --> 01:07:46,580
Of course.

1978
01:07:47,040 --> 01:07:48,540
- You are the tiger.
- Let me help you feel...

1979
01:07:49,040 --> 01:07:50,350
what it's like.

1980
01:07:51,520 --> 01:07:53,310
(Please spare me.)

1981
01:07:54,560 --> 01:07:56,150
(It's a touch-and-go situation.)

1982
01:07:56,150 --> 01:07:57,750
Jong Kook, please.

1983
01:07:58,120 --> 01:08:00,620
(Despite his effort,)

1984
01:08:00,620 --> 01:08:03,620
(the kid who grew up watching
Running Man is outmatched.)

1985
01:08:03,620 --> 01:08:05,230
You are too strong!

1986
01:08:05,670 --> 01:08:07,040
(Jong Kook is relaxed.)

1987
01:08:08,400 --> 01:08:09,770
(Ripping)

1988
01:08:10,210 --> 01:08:14,310
(I didn't think Name Tag Elimination
would end so quickly.)

1989
01:08:14,900 --> 01:08:17,170
I wasn't going to rip off
anyone's name tag.

1990
01:08:17,170 --> 01:08:18,940
I was looking for the hidden ones.
Why did you follow me?

1991
01:08:20,270 --> 01:08:22,420
(After the storm,)

1992
01:08:22,420 --> 01:08:23,540
Look at this.

1993
01:08:23,540 --> 01:08:24,690
It broke.

1994
01:08:24,690 --> 01:08:26,520
(only the traces
of a ruthless fight remain.)

1995
01:08:26,520 --> 01:08:28,190
Do Hyun, you got
your name tag ripped off.

1996
01:08:29,420 --> 01:08:33,060
You always participate in a race
with someone like him.

1997
01:08:33,160 --> 01:08:34,620
- Yes.
- How do you do it?

1998
01:08:34,900 --> 01:08:37,420
- They could be at the cafeteria.
- There must be many here.

1999
01:08:37,530 --> 01:08:38,640
Shall we go inside?

2000
01:08:39,770 --> 01:08:41,910
- They could be here.
- You are looking in there.

2001
01:08:41,910 --> 01:08:44,460
(They flaunt their skills
as the fruitless search continues.)

2002
01:08:44,460 --> 01:08:45,570
Of course.

2003
01:08:46,000 --> 01:08:47,170
You are incredible.

2004
01:08:47,240 --> 01:08:49,000
I didn't think to look in there.

2005
01:08:50,410 --> 01:08:51,650
They could be here.

2006
01:08:51,650 --> 01:08:53,020
You didn't see this, did you?

2007
01:08:53,710 --> 01:08:56,490
(There is an envelope
containing a name tag.)

2008
01:08:58,150 --> 01:08:59,280
This is a new pattern, right?

2009
01:08:59,660 --> 01:09:01,360
- Whose...
- Whose name tag is inside?

2010
01:09:02,060 --> 01:09:03,560
Gosh, it's So Min's.

2011
01:09:04,750 --> 01:09:06,320
It's So Min's.

2012
01:09:06,450 --> 01:09:07,530
- Jae Suk.
- Yes?

2013
01:09:07,530 --> 01:09:09,360
- Give me So Min's name tag.
- Why?

2014
01:09:10,700 --> 01:09:12,290
- Why?
- I want to sell it.

2015
01:09:12,290 --> 01:09:13,990
(I want to sell it
to the other team.)

2016
01:09:16,030 --> 01:09:17,030
Come on.

2017
01:09:17,030 --> 01:09:18,740
I am dying here.

2018
01:09:19,240 --> 01:09:20,980
- You can't do that.
- Why not?

2019
01:09:20,980 --> 01:09:22,980
You can't sell
your fellow team member's name tag!

2020
01:09:23,780 --> 01:09:24,870
- Seriously.
- Give it to me.

2021
01:09:24,870 --> 01:09:26,570
I want to sell it for two coins.

2022
01:09:26,570 --> 01:09:27,740
I don't have any coins.

2023
01:09:27,820 --> 01:09:28,890
Give it to me.

2024
01:09:30,820 --> 01:09:32,080
What are you doing? What is it?

2025
01:09:32,080 --> 01:09:33,190
(So Min appears.)

2026
01:09:33,450 --> 01:09:34,990
(Both of them are flustered.)

2027
01:09:34,990 --> 01:09:36,420
- What is it?
- It's nothing.

2028
01:09:36,490 --> 01:09:37,860
- What were you doing?
- What?

2029
01:09:37,860 --> 01:09:39,900
What were you doing? What is that?

2030
01:09:40,320 --> 01:09:42,460
- What is that?
- Whose name tag is it?

2031
01:09:42,600 --> 01:09:43,700
- Whose is it?
- Whose is it?

2032
01:09:43,700 --> 01:09:46,640
- I can't tell you.
- Why not? We are on the same team.

2033
01:09:46,640 --> 01:09:47,960
- It's yours, right?
- No.

2034
01:09:47,960 --> 01:09:49,440
- Whose is it?
- Actually,

2035
01:09:49,440 --> 01:09:51,570
it doesn't matter whether it belongs
to someone on my team or me.

2036
01:09:51,570 --> 01:09:53,670
- I used to think the same.
- Hurry up and spill.

2037
01:09:53,670 --> 01:09:55,200
But even a team member's name tag
does matter.

2038
01:09:55,200 --> 01:09:57,240
(I figured it out.)

2039
01:09:57,780 --> 01:09:59,040
(Haha gave a new meaning
to a fellow team member's name tag.)

2040
01:09:59,040 --> 01:10:00,670
I used to think the same
until a moment ago.

2041
01:10:01,150 --> 01:10:02,490
- But...
- What do you mean?

2042
01:10:02,490 --> 01:10:03,910
even a fellow team member's
name tag has its use.

2043
01:10:03,910 --> 01:10:05,520
- Please explain.
- It didn't occur to me at first.

2044
01:10:05,520 --> 01:10:06,860
What do you mean?
What use does it have?

2045
01:10:06,860 --> 01:10:08,060
Whose is it? Give it to me.

2046
01:10:08,060 --> 01:10:10,120
- I have everyone's.
- Whose is it?

2047
01:10:10,660 --> 01:10:13,290
(Whose name tag does she have?)

2048
01:10:13,290 --> 01:10:14,420
- Tell us.
- In that case,

2049
01:10:14,530 --> 01:10:15,920
- give me mine.
- Why?

2050
01:10:15,920 --> 01:10:17,030
I will give you yours.

2051
01:10:19,070 --> 01:10:21,240
- Is it Jae Suk's?
- Yes. I have his.

2052
01:10:21,640 --> 01:10:22,770
Give it to me.

2053
01:10:23,360 --> 01:10:25,410
- Come on. Give it to me.
- Give it to me.

2054
01:10:25,670 --> 01:10:28,240
- I can't trust you.
- You are holding it too tightly.

2055
01:10:28,350 --> 01:10:29,450
Come here.

2056
01:10:29,450 --> 01:10:30,480
I will pay a coin for it.

2057
01:10:30,480 --> 01:10:32,350
(He wants to buy
Jae Suk's name tag.)

2058
01:10:33,210 --> 01:10:34,740
I will sell it to you for two coins.

2059
01:10:34,740 --> 01:10:36,280
You are a swindler.

2060
01:10:36,580 --> 01:10:37,650
- Hey!
- Let me see it.

2061
01:10:37,650 --> 01:10:38,660
(Jae Suk forces the trade.)

2062
01:10:39,020 --> 01:10:41,490
(He opens So Min's envelope.)

2063
01:10:41,490 --> 01:10:42,820
There is nothing inside!

2064
01:10:42,820 --> 01:10:44,690
(Annoyed)

2065
01:10:45,950 --> 01:10:48,860
(So Min is the queen of investment.)

2066
01:10:48,990 --> 01:10:50,660
She is the absolute worst.

2067
01:10:50,660 --> 01:10:52,100
I hate her.

2068
01:10:52,100 --> 01:10:53,900
What is wrong with her?

2069
01:10:53,900 --> 01:10:54,960
(Jae Suk, thank you for the trade.)

2070
01:10:54,960 --> 01:10:56,640
She keeps getting worse.

2071
01:10:57,270 --> 01:10:59,610
(After the trade...)

2072
01:10:59,810 --> 01:11:00,830
Se Chan.

2073
01:11:00,910 --> 01:11:03,070
I will sell 2 of my team's name tags
for 3 coins.

2074
01:11:03,070 --> 01:11:04,650
- My coins? Can we do that?
- Yes.

2075
01:11:04,650 --> 01:11:05,950
I don't need these name tags.

2076
01:11:05,950 --> 01:11:07,950
- Hold on. Stay right there.
- Come here.

2077
01:11:07,950 --> 01:11:10,410
- Stay there.
- I have four name tags in total.

2078
01:11:10,580 --> 01:11:12,910
- Hold on. How...
- I found them.

2079
01:11:12,910 --> 01:11:14,490
- Did you find them?
- How did you find so many?

2080
01:11:14,490 --> 01:11:16,890
I can't do anything with them
since they belong to my team,

2081
01:11:16,890 --> 01:11:17,950
so I want to sell them.

2082
01:11:17,950 --> 01:11:21,770
I need coins because Suk Jin
probably won't give me any.

2083
01:11:21,860 --> 01:11:23,730
Thus, I want some coins for myself.

2084
01:11:24,230 --> 01:11:26,240
- So this is a private business.
- I am running a private business.

2085
01:11:27,030 --> 01:11:28,860
3 coins for 2 name tags.

2086
01:11:28,860 --> 01:11:29,940
Five coins for these.

2087
01:11:29,940 --> 01:11:32,670
- I have seven name tags.
- In that case...

2088
01:11:32,830 --> 01:11:33,940
I will pay three coins.

2089
01:11:33,940 --> 01:11:35,000
I will sell these for five coins.

2090
01:11:35,000 --> 01:11:36,350
- How many do you want to sell?
- Three name tags.

2091
01:11:36,480 --> 01:11:37,540
You said earlier that
you would sell four name tags.

2092
01:11:37,540 --> 01:11:38,650
There are some I can't sell.

2093
01:11:38,740 --> 01:11:39,780
Listen.

2094
01:11:39,780 --> 01:11:41,450
We can't buy from a private seller
who changes her words.

2095
01:11:41,450 --> 01:11:43,390
- Let's go.
- I have three name tags to sell.

2096
01:11:43,390 --> 01:11:45,320
- Let's go.
- Buy two name tags.

2097
01:11:45,320 --> 01:11:47,080
ZICO, buy two name tags.

2098
01:11:47,080 --> 01:11:48,530
- Buy two name tags.
- ZICO.

2099
01:11:48,530 --> 01:11:49,750
This is how you do business.

2100
01:11:50,920 --> 01:11:53,120
(This is how you do business.)

2101
01:11:53,730 --> 01:11:55,660
They are so cheap.

2102
01:11:55,820 --> 01:11:57,320
(She is tired from meeting
annoying customers.)

2103
01:11:57,320 --> 01:11:58,440
I would buy all of these name tags.

2104
01:11:58,960 --> 01:12:00,270
I don't even know. I will get going.

2105
01:12:00,270 --> 01:12:02,270
(It's another peace race
on Running Man.)

2106
01:12:02,270 --> 01:12:03,910
I should have gotten more coins.

2107
01:12:03,910 --> 01:12:05,480
- I will give you the next question.
- Okay.

2108
01:12:06,070 --> 01:12:08,240
This one is about So Min.

2109
01:12:08,240 --> 01:12:09,650
I don't know anything about So Min.

2110
01:12:09,650 --> 01:12:11,780
On Running Man, So Min once said,

2111
01:12:11,780 --> 01:12:16,610
"In high school, 'Blank' went
into my clothes by accident."

2112
01:12:16,690 --> 01:12:18,390
- Blank?
- What goes in the blank?

2113
01:12:18,390 --> 01:12:19,950
- It went into her clothes?
- Yes.

2114
01:12:19,950 --> 01:12:21,210
Let me answer! A flower.

2115
01:12:22,580 --> 01:12:23,620
Is it incorrect?

2116
01:12:23,990 --> 01:12:25,790
(Kwang Soo hits his head
with the stick part.)

2117
01:12:25,790 --> 01:12:26,950
Gosh, I am sorry.

2118
01:12:27,560 --> 01:12:29,070
Gosh, I am sorry.

2119
01:12:29,120 --> 01:12:33,640
- It was an accident.
- What did you use to hit me?

2120
01:12:33,990 --> 01:12:35,440
It was an accident.

2121
01:12:35,860 --> 01:12:36,960
Are you okay?

2122
01:12:37,330 --> 01:12:38,440
It was an accident.

2123
01:12:38,440 --> 01:12:40,170
- You were closer than I thought.
- All right.

2124
01:12:40,240 --> 01:12:41,440
I shouldn't have stretched my arm.

2125
01:12:41,670 --> 01:12:44,150
- I shouldn't have stretched my arm.
- All right.

2126
01:12:45,110 --> 01:12:46,410
Let me answer. A petal.

2127
01:12:46,870 --> 01:12:48,850
(Suk Jin's answer is incorrect.)

2128
01:12:48,850 --> 01:12:50,390
(Aim well.)

2129
01:12:50,540 --> 01:12:51,650
It's here.

2130
01:12:53,190 --> 01:12:56,160
(What? Kwang Soo hits his head
with the side this time.)

2131
01:12:56,950 --> 01:12:58,060
(Suk Jin explodes.)

2132
01:12:58,060 --> 01:13:00,560
What are you doing?

2133
01:13:00,560 --> 01:13:01,960
I hit you properly this time.

2134
01:13:02,070 --> 01:13:03,770
- It felt different, you jerk.
- Why?

2135
01:13:04,070 --> 01:13:06,490
(It's a strange toy hammer
that hits with a thud.)

2136
01:13:06,770 --> 01:13:07,790
What?

2137
01:13:07,790 --> 01:13:08,910
I hit you properly this time.

2138
01:13:08,910 --> 01:13:10,700
(While the two centers argue)

2139
01:13:10,700 --> 01:13:11,830
Hold on.

2140
01:13:12,780 --> 01:13:15,980
Did you put coins
in the piggy banks?

2141
01:13:15,980 --> 01:13:17,350
- No, I didn't.
- You didn't?

2142
01:13:17,570 --> 01:13:18,610
(This is strange.)

2143
01:13:18,610 --> 01:13:20,780
ZICO, did you put coins
in the piggy banks?

2144
01:13:20,980 --> 01:13:23,280
Seong Wu, did you put coins
in the piggy banks?

2145
01:13:23,390 --> 01:13:24,780
I never went into that room.

2146
01:13:24,780 --> 01:13:26,210
(No one has received coins
from the center.)

2147
01:13:26,210 --> 01:13:27,660
- I...
- Everyone, gather around.

2148
01:13:27,820 --> 01:13:29,080
Do Hyun.

2149
01:13:29,080 --> 01:13:31,080
Do Hyun, did you put coins
in the piggy banks?

2150
01:13:31,490 --> 01:13:33,530
- He never gave me the coins.
- No?

2151
01:13:33,790 --> 01:13:35,990
- I never got any coins.
- Listen, everyone.

2152
01:13:35,990 --> 01:13:37,400
You have the right to go in there.

2153
01:13:37,400 --> 01:13:38,600
(You have the right
to go into the piggy bank room.)

2154
01:13:38,600 --> 01:13:39,770
- What would we do in there?
- We don't have coins.

2155
01:13:39,770 --> 01:13:41,360
Kwang Soo has the coins.

2156
01:13:41,360 --> 01:13:42,610
(The coins
the naive members collected...)

2157
01:13:42,610 --> 01:13:45,440
(are in the greedy center's hands.)

2158
01:13:45,810 --> 01:13:47,570
Hold on.
We need to make a complaint.

2159
01:13:47,570 --> 01:13:48,810
Come here. Gather around.

2160
01:13:49,110 --> 01:13:50,310
- Kwang Soo.
- Yes?

2161
01:13:50,310 --> 01:13:52,450
Why didn't you give a single coin
to the members?

2162
01:13:52,670 --> 01:13:54,610
- What?
- Everyone is dissatisfied.

2163
01:13:54,610 --> 01:13:56,490
- Go! Go and work!
- Come here.

2164
01:13:56,490 --> 01:13:57,910
- Go and wok!
- Come here.

2165
01:13:57,910 --> 01:13:59,750
- You did nothing.
- Why didn't you give a single coin?

2166
01:13:59,750 --> 01:14:01,450
- What are you doing?
- I am...

2167
01:14:01,450 --> 01:14:02,490
You instigated them.

2168
01:14:02,490 --> 01:14:03,490
I am their representative.

2169
01:14:03,490 --> 01:14:04,730
Why didn't you give a single coin
to the members?

2170
01:14:04,820 --> 01:14:07,120
Hard work pays off, okay?

2171
01:14:07,120 --> 01:14:09,600
It's not like
I will take all the coins.

2172
01:14:09,600 --> 01:14:10,990
Shouldn't we get the coins...

2173
01:14:10,990 --> 01:14:12,660
- once we give you the name tags?
- That's right.

2174
01:14:12,660 --> 01:14:14,240
- Listen.
- Hey, don't be like that.

2175
01:14:14,740 --> 01:14:16,660
- Give us two coins each.
- I will give them to whom I trust.

2176
01:14:16,660 --> 01:14:18,140
- That's the captain's duty.
- That's right.

2177
01:14:18,140 --> 01:14:19,610
- Give us two coins each.
- Let me ask you this.

2178
01:14:19,610 --> 01:14:20,810
Who is your captain?

2179
01:14:21,740 --> 01:14:22,950
Then why are you listening to him?

2180
01:14:22,950 --> 01:14:24,650
We will put some coins
in your piggy bank too.

2181
01:14:24,650 --> 01:14:26,150
Be fair. We will put some coins
in your piggy bank too.

2182
01:14:26,150 --> 01:14:27,320
Stand up straight.

2183
01:14:27,870 --> 01:14:29,910
- Guys, this is...
- You jerks!

2184
01:14:30,850 --> 01:14:33,360
(How dare you talk back
to the center?)

2185
01:14:33,360 --> 01:14:34,450
Go and work!

2186
01:14:35,320 --> 01:14:36,420
Go and work!

2187
01:14:37,160 --> 01:14:38,950
Do you think I am lazing around?
Go and work!

2188
01:14:39,730 --> 01:14:41,530
- Don't let him sway you.
- Use this time to get...

2189
01:14:41,530 --> 01:14:43,120
as many name tags as possible.

2190
01:14:43,120 --> 01:14:45,700
If I were you, I would give away
my name tag to sabotage him.

2191
01:14:45,790 --> 01:14:47,030
- Hey.
- I didn't think about this.

2192
01:14:47,030 --> 01:14:48,490
Why are you ganging up on me?

2193
01:14:49,110 --> 01:14:50,860
(The group action
makes Kwang Soo anxious.)

2194
01:14:50,860 --> 01:14:52,670
- I will distribute them as I want.
- Okay.

2195
01:14:52,670 --> 01:14:53,830
I will distribute them as I want.

2196
01:14:54,170 --> 01:14:56,070
Close your eyes.

2197
01:14:57,000 --> 01:14:59,110
- Close your eyes.
- We worked hard!

2198
01:14:59,150 --> 01:15:01,020
Close your eyes.

2199
01:15:01,150 --> 01:15:02,990
I will distribute the coins.

2200
01:15:02,990 --> 01:15:04,190
(They close their eyes willingly
because they are nice.)

2201
01:15:04,190 --> 01:15:05,910
I see someone
who didn't close his eyes.

2202
01:15:05,910 --> 01:15:07,710
Do Hyun didn't close his eyes.
Oh, I am wrong.

2203
01:15:09,320 --> 01:15:10,420
Close your eyes.

2204
01:15:10,420 --> 01:15:11,920
(He gives 3 coins to Seong Wu.)

2205
01:15:13,160 --> 01:15:14,200
(Is he taking them back?)

2206
01:15:14,200 --> 01:15:15,230
Hold on.

2207
01:15:15,400 --> 01:15:16,960
Let go. Let go
if you want your fingers intact.

2208
01:15:19,070 --> 01:15:20,960
(Flustered)

2209
01:15:20,960 --> 01:15:23,030
- Did you pass by me already?
- I will give you some.

2210
01:15:23,610 --> 01:15:24,700
Hide your coins.

2211
01:15:24,910 --> 01:15:25,940
Hide your coins.

2212
01:15:26,310 --> 01:15:27,700
Hide your coins.
Don't show each other.

2213
01:15:29,310 --> 01:15:30,540
I distributed all the coins.

2214
01:15:30,650 --> 01:15:32,020
- We only got a few.
- I distributed all the coins.

2215
01:15:32,020 --> 01:15:33,170
I worked so hard.

2216
01:15:33,170 --> 01:15:34,610
I distributed all the coins.
I don't have any coins left.

2217
01:15:34,910 --> 01:15:36,150
- You don't have any coins left?
- No.

2218
01:15:36,150 --> 01:15:37,690
- Are you certain?
- Yes. I distributed all the coins.

2219
01:15:37,690 --> 01:15:39,280
Okay. Kwang Soo,

2220
01:15:39,390 --> 01:15:40,990
can I check your back pockets?

2221
01:15:41,610 --> 01:15:42,690
You jerk.

2222
01:15:42,990 --> 01:15:44,030
What?

2223
01:15:44,190 --> 01:15:46,100
- This is unfair.
- The only thing I have is a phone.

2224
01:15:47,950 --> 01:15:50,920
(When he takes out his phone,
they hear the sound of coins.)

2225
01:15:51,730 --> 01:15:53,330
(Hold on.)

2226
01:15:53,330 --> 01:15:55,240
- Hold on.
- What was that sound?

2227
01:15:55,740 --> 01:15:57,700
Okay. You guys passed the test.

2228
01:15:58,910 --> 01:16:01,500
(Everyone passed
the observation test.)

2229
01:16:01,500 --> 01:16:02,650
- Kwang Soo.
- Okay.

2230
01:16:02,740 --> 01:16:04,410
- That's a lot!
- I will give them to you.

2231
01:16:04,780 --> 01:16:05,850
I will give them to you.

2232
01:16:05,910 --> 01:16:07,910
There is no one I can trust, okay?

2233
01:16:07,910 --> 01:16:09,690
- This is too much.
- Listen.

2234
01:16:09,910 --> 01:16:11,740
The member
who paid one coin earlier,

2235
01:16:13,020 --> 01:16:14,190
Seong Wu, will get five coins.

2236
01:16:14,360 --> 01:16:15,860
- What?
- You will get five coins.

2237
01:16:16,120 --> 01:16:17,390
This is nothing to be happy about.

2238
01:16:17,390 --> 01:16:18,560
Put one coin in your piggy bank.

2239
01:16:18,730 --> 01:16:19,920
- Okay.
- Put one coin in your piggy bank.

2240
01:16:19,920 --> 01:16:22,030
- The rest...
- I paid one coin earlier too.

2241
01:16:22,100 --> 01:16:24,290
- Did you pay one coin, ZICO?
- This is too much.

2242
01:16:24,290 --> 01:16:25,440
ZICO, leave the room.

2243
01:16:25,660 --> 01:16:27,330
Go. Go and work!

2244
01:16:27,330 --> 01:16:28,360
(ZICO goes back to work.)

2245
01:16:28,360 --> 01:16:29,410
- I will give you one.
- Thank you.

2246
01:16:29,410 --> 01:16:30,810
- Put them in my piggy bank.
- I will do that.

2247
01:16:30,810 --> 01:16:32,370
If our team loses,

2248
01:16:32,640 --> 01:16:34,110
- we will get the penalty.
- Okay.

2249
01:16:34,280 --> 01:16:36,280
Look at the forest, not the trees.

2250
01:16:36,280 --> 01:16:37,480
It's the team that matters.

2251
01:16:37,480 --> 01:16:39,780
(The center's favorite member,
Seong Wu enters.)

2252
01:16:41,280 --> 01:16:44,520
(He puts one coin
in his piggy bank.)

2253
01:16:44,520 --> 01:16:45,950
(Then he adds another one.)

2254
01:16:46,020 --> 01:16:48,860
(He has a conscience,
so he gives one to Kwang Soo.)

2255
01:16:49,120 --> 01:16:50,660
(Seong Wu deviates a little,)

2256
01:16:50,660 --> 01:16:52,120
(and Ji Hun is next.)

2257
01:16:53,030 --> 01:16:56,290
(He embezzles without hesitating.)

2258
01:16:57,100 --> 01:16:59,070
(Like center, like teammate.)

2259
01:16:59,460 --> 01:17:02,530
(Do Hyun and Se Chan were
discontent. They deposit the coins.)

2260
01:17:03,740 --> 01:17:05,160
Five minutes left.

2261
01:17:05,160 --> 01:17:06,830
You have to hurry!

2262
01:17:07,070 --> 01:17:09,310
Rip off name tags like crazy.
We're losing right now.

2263
01:17:09,410 --> 01:17:11,850
- Hurry. Anybody!
- Hurry up.

2264
01:17:11,950 --> 01:17:12,980
Should I go now?

2265
01:17:12,980 --> 01:17:13,980
(ZICO was abandoned by Kwang Soo,)

2266
01:17:13,980 --> 01:17:15,280
(but he shows his loyalty
near the end.)

2267
01:17:15,280 --> 01:17:17,110
- They're not my team.
- Okay!

2268
01:17:17,110 --> 01:17:18,490
- Four dollars.
- Hurry!

2269
01:17:18,490 --> 01:17:21,160
(He flung ZICO earlier,
but he loves him now.)

2270
01:17:21,360 --> 01:17:24,080
We're behind by 12 to 13.

2271
01:17:24,730 --> 01:17:26,990
- Your team has enough. Take it.
- Wait.

2272
01:17:27,320 --> 01:17:29,700
Your team has enough.
Give it to yourself.

2273
01:17:29,700 --> 01:17:31,030
Race is over.

2274
01:17:31,030 --> 01:17:33,270
This is the last chance.

2275
01:17:33,270 --> 01:17:34,600
(Race is over, and this is
the last chance to deposit coins.)

2276
01:17:35,160 --> 01:17:36,700
(Did Kwang Soo and the team
see the forest or the trees?)

2277
01:17:36,700 --> 01:17:39,070
- I think we won.
- You guys already won.

2278
01:17:39,070 --> 01:17:40,440
Race is over.

2279
01:17:40,910 --> 01:17:43,350
We're counting the coins right now.

2280
01:17:43,350 --> 01:17:45,370
As I said before, we'll compare
which captain has more coins,

2281
01:17:45,370 --> 01:17:47,020
and the team with that captain wins.

2282
01:17:47,020 --> 01:17:48,480
1st and 2nd place on
the winning team will win prizes,

2283
01:17:48,480 --> 01:17:50,390
and the last two on the losing team
will face the penalty.

2284
01:17:50,390 --> 01:17:52,750
I heard something shocking
from that team,

2285
01:17:52,750 --> 01:17:53,780
but I hope it's not true.

2286
01:17:53,780 --> 01:17:55,860
Somebody sold their name tag.

2287
01:17:56,530 --> 01:17:58,120
- No way.
- Somebody gave 2 to 3 coins...

2288
01:17:58,120 --> 01:17:59,790
per name tag.

2289
01:17:59,790 --> 01:18:01,820
- I hope it's not true.
- This is the funny part.

2290
01:18:01,860 --> 01:18:02,990
They sold other people's
name tags for cheap...

2291
01:18:02,990 --> 01:18:04,820
and sold their own
at a higher price.

2292
01:18:05,070 --> 01:18:07,070
Other people for cheap,
and theirs at a higher price.

2293
01:18:07,070 --> 01:18:10,240
I heard my name tag got sold
for a coin.

2294
01:18:10,360 --> 01:18:13,000
My team fell apart.

2295
01:18:13,000 --> 01:18:15,240
There was no other way.
I didn't want to lose.

2296
01:18:16,280 --> 01:18:18,450
- Suk Jin, look at yours first.
- Okay, I will.

2297
01:18:18,450 --> 01:18:19,570
This.

2298
01:18:19,570 --> 01:18:20,740
It looks heavy.

2299
01:18:20,740 --> 01:18:23,780
- You probably have a lot.
- I know, I gave him a lot.

2300
01:18:23,780 --> 01:18:25,390
I gave him everything.

2301
01:18:25,390 --> 01:18:27,060
- Stop lying.
- I gave him a lot.

2302
01:18:27,060 --> 01:18:28,160
That's a lot.

2303
01:18:28,160 --> 01:18:29,990
Haha is lying 100 percent.

2304
01:18:29,990 --> 01:18:31,750
Suk Jin got...

2305
01:18:31,750 --> 01:18:32,990
43 coins.

2306
01:18:32,990 --> 01:18:34,120
(Suk Jin's piggy bank
had 43 coins.)

2307
01:18:34,290 --> 01:18:35,490
43 in this?

2308
01:18:35,490 --> 01:18:36,770
That's a lot.

2309
01:18:36,770 --> 01:18:38,030
- I gave you all of them.
- I gave you them all.

2310
01:18:38,030 --> 01:18:39,570
Really? You gave me a lot.

2311
01:18:39,570 --> 01:18:40,960
(Kwang Soo opens his piggy bank.)

2312
01:18:42,160 --> 01:18:43,360
We should have more.

2313
01:18:43,660 --> 01:18:44,770
His...

2314
01:18:44,770 --> 01:18:46,280
I don't hear anything.

2315
01:18:46,410 --> 01:18:48,440
Maybe we won.

2316
01:18:48,440 --> 01:18:50,040
- We won.
- I think we won.

2317
01:18:50,040 --> 01:18:51,110
Wait.

2318
01:18:51,950 --> 01:18:53,870
This can't be. My gosh.

2319
01:18:53,870 --> 01:18:55,320
- Was that it?
- Wait.

2320
01:18:55,320 --> 01:18:56,950
- See?
- We won.

2321
01:18:56,950 --> 01:18:58,390
- We're family.
- Wait.

2322
01:18:58,390 --> 01:18:59,690
That was everything.

2323
01:18:59,690 --> 01:19:00,910
- Goodness.
- This is unbelievable.

2324
01:19:00,990 --> 01:19:02,580
These people.

2325
01:19:03,060 --> 01:19:04,730
(Team Kwang Soo acted collectively.)

2326
01:19:04,730 --> 01:19:06,490
- Let me tell you.
- These people.

2327
01:19:06,560 --> 01:19:08,230
Kwang Soo's piggy bank...

2328
01:19:08,230 --> 01:19:09,600
- had 16 coins.
- What?

2329
01:19:09,600 --> 01:19:12,100
(Only 16?)

2330
01:19:12,100 --> 01:19:13,990
- What?
- Overall,

2331
01:19:14,290 --> 01:19:16,330
Suk Jin had 70,

2332
01:19:17,830 --> 01:19:20,500
(Kwang Soo was ahead by 13.)

2333
01:19:20,500 --> 01:19:22,240
and Kwang Soo had 56.

2334
01:19:22,240 --> 01:19:24,110
(With only 56,
Team Kwang Soo loses.)

2335
01:19:24,310 --> 01:19:26,520
(Team Suk Jin wins.)

2336
01:19:26,520 --> 01:19:28,320
- This is family.
- This is unbelievable.

2337
01:19:28,320 --> 01:19:29,820
- This is family.
- Team Suk Jin wins.

2338
01:19:30,490 --> 01:19:31,740
This is amazing.

2339
01:19:31,740 --> 01:19:34,080
You guys! I told you.

2340
01:19:34,080 --> 01:19:35,360
Really?

2341
01:19:35,360 --> 01:19:36,360
No, look.

2342
01:19:36,360 --> 01:19:38,060
I got seven,
and I gave you everything.

2343
01:19:38,060 --> 01:19:39,420
I didn't get too many.

2344
01:19:39,420 --> 01:19:40,790
They took the coins for themselves.

2345
01:19:40,790 --> 01:19:42,820
This is so unfair.

2346
01:19:42,960 --> 01:19:45,160
1st and 2nd place are as follows.

2347
01:19:45,160 --> 01:19:46,740
So Min came in first place.

2348
01:19:46,740 --> 01:19:49,110
(So Min places first.)

2349
01:19:50,740 --> 01:19:52,370
I came in first?

2350
01:19:52,370 --> 01:19:54,140
- What did you do?
- I came in first?

2351
01:19:54,140 --> 01:19:55,850
Yes. I'm in first place?

2352
01:19:56,070 --> 01:19:57,700
The individual businesswoman won.

2353
01:19:57,850 --> 01:19:59,150
She got a couple from us.

2354
01:19:59,150 --> 01:20:00,540
(She collected small sums
and created a miracle.)

2355
01:20:00,540 --> 01:20:02,780
She got none in here, and she won?

2356
01:20:02,780 --> 01:20:05,040
Jae Suk and Jong Kook
come in second.

2357
01:20:05,040 --> 01:20:06,250
(Are we 2nd place?)

2358
01:20:06,250 --> 01:20:08,690
Jong Kook!

2359
01:20:08,690 --> 01:20:09,750
(Suk Jin, So Min, Jong Kook,
and Jae Suk win prizes.)

2360
01:20:09,750 --> 01:20:11,560
Kwang Soo, open each one.

2361
01:20:11,690 --> 01:20:14,700
I don't know anymore.

2362
01:20:14,900 --> 01:20:16,360
I won't let this go.

2363
01:20:16,530 --> 01:20:18,860
I'm looking forward to this.

2364
01:20:18,960 --> 01:20:20,240
Ji Hun first.

2365
01:20:20,240 --> 01:20:22,640
I'm not really suspicious.

2366
01:20:23,140 --> 01:20:24,500
Like this? Okay.

2367
01:20:24,700 --> 01:20:26,280
- Is there a lot?
- Is there a good amount?

2368
01:20:26,700 --> 01:20:28,200
It looks kind of heavy.

2369
01:20:28,200 --> 01:20:30,480
(Spilling)

2370
01:20:31,540 --> 01:20:32,710
(He's shocked.)

2371
01:20:32,710 --> 01:20:35,320
- How many?
- Ji Hun deposited 14 coins.

2372
01:20:35,320 --> 01:20:36,990
He took all for himself.

2373
01:20:37,580 --> 01:20:38,710
Did you not give me any?

2374
01:20:38,710 --> 01:20:40,080
I gave you one.

2375
01:20:40,610 --> 01:20:41,890
- You gave me one?
- Yes.

2376
01:20:41,990 --> 01:20:43,280
Kwang Soo.

2377
01:20:43,280 --> 01:20:44,560
(Do Hyun's piggy bank is next.)

2378
01:20:44,560 --> 01:20:46,320
Do Hyun is convincing.

2379
01:20:46,320 --> 01:20:47,950
(There's also a lot.)

2380
01:20:47,950 --> 01:20:49,770
Do Hyun took 10.

2381
01:20:49,770 --> 01:20:50,900
- 10?
- This is funny.

2382
01:20:51,620 --> 01:20:53,530
This team is so funny.

2383
01:20:53,530 --> 01:20:54,830
They're all like Kwang Soo.

2384
01:20:54,900 --> 01:20:57,160
- Se Chan.
- I don't have too many.

2385
01:20:57,160 --> 01:20:58,270
(As expected)

2386
01:20:58,270 --> 01:21:00,110
12 for Se Chan.

2387
01:21:00,110 --> 01:21:02,140
- 12? That was less than I thought.
- Yes, 12.

2388
01:21:02,810 --> 01:21:03,980
(He accidentally spoke
what was on his mind.)

2389
01:21:03,980 --> 01:21:05,000
Really?

2390
01:21:05,850 --> 01:21:06,870
That was less than I thought.

2391
01:21:06,870 --> 01:21:08,610
He even caused a revolt.

2392
01:21:08,610 --> 01:21:09,650
How many?

2393
01:21:09,740 --> 01:21:11,150
- He has a lot.
- Seong Wu...

2394
01:21:11,150 --> 01:21:12,490
- had seven.
- That's less than I thought.

2395
01:21:12,490 --> 01:21:13,860
- Really?
- Seven? Wait.

2396
01:21:13,860 --> 01:21:15,250
- What happens then?
- That wasn't what he expected.

2397
01:21:15,520 --> 01:21:17,160
ZICO doesn't have much.

2398
01:21:17,160 --> 01:21:18,320
(ZICO seemed the most sneaky
on Team Kwang Soo,)

2399
01:21:18,950 --> 01:21:19,990
ZICO had two.

2400
01:21:19,990 --> 01:21:21,100
(but he was the only loyal subject.)

2401
01:21:21,100 --> 01:21:22,860
- ZICO.
- I gave you everything.

2402
01:21:22,990 --> 01:21:24,660
Kwang Soo,

2403
01:21:24,660 --> 01:21:27,270
you found teammates
who were similar to you.

2404
01:21:27,270 --> 01:21:29,240
What's wrong with them?

2405
01:21:29,910 --> 01:21:31,240
Kwang Soo,
you will be getting the penalty.

2406
01:21:31,240 --> 01:21:33,440
Last place is Do Hyun,

2407
01:21:33,440 --> 01:21:35,310
and fifth place is ZICO.

2408
01:21:35,310 --> 01:21:36,370
(Do Hyun and ZICO will
get the penalty.)

2409
01:21:36,370 --> 01:21:37,980
My bad. Was that too loud?

2410
01:21:37,980 --> 01:21:38,980
- ZICO.
- Yes!

2411
01:21:38,980 --> 01:21:41,040
(He cheered.)

2412
01:21:41,040 --> 01:21:44,350
My bad. I was too loud.

2413
01:21:44,350 --> 01:21:47,190
ZICO lost because he didn't cheat.

2414
01:21:47,190 --> 01:21:48,210
That's true.

2415
01:21:48,210 --> 01:21:49,660
- Sit down.
- Sit.

2416
01:21:49,750 --> 01:21:52,700
Hold him
so that he doesn't fall backward.

2417
01:21:52,700 --> 01:21:54,420
- How intense is it?
- It's good.

2418
01:21:54,420 --> 01:21:55,960
No, it's not too bad.

2419
01:21:55,960 --> 01:21:57,100
It's just the forehead.

2420
01:21:57,820 --> 01:21:58,920
Wait.

2421
01:21:59,790 --> 01:22:01,790
(That was full of captain's love.)

2422
01:22:01,990 --> 01:22:05,140
- You'll walk home like this.
- ZICO.

2423
01:22:05,140 --> 01:22:07,330
- You can hit Kwang Soo.
- This is so unfair.

2424
01:22:08,310 --> 01:22:09,350
(Running Man kid Do Hyun...)

2425
01:22:09,350 --> 01:22:12,450
(also gets a taste of the show.)

2426
01:22:13,710 --> 01:22:14,980
(Slapping)

2427
01:22:15,370 --> 01:22:18,740
(Kwang Soo also gets a taste of
master forehead slapper's skill.)

2428
01:22:18,990 --> 01:22:20,990
He absorbed the force.

2429
01:22:20,990 --> 01:22:22,360
You know the lucky draw, right?

2430
01:22:22,530 --> 01:22:24,730
Please go in whatever order
you decide.

2431
01:22:24,730 --> 01:22:26,700
- Go ahead, Jae Suk.
- Should I go first?

2432
01:22:26,700 --> 01:22:28,660
I like...

2433
01:22:28,660 --> 01:22:30,900
I hope he gets Yu San Seul's CD.

2434
01:22:31,730 --> 01:22:32,990
Me too.

2435
01:22:33,790 --> 01:22:35,070
- Please.
- Everybody,

2436
01:22:35,070 --> 01:22:36,860
there's a pattern.

2437
01:22:36,860 --> 01:22:38,910
This is not random.

2438
01:22:38,910 --> 01:22:41,110
- Is there a pattern?
- Yes, Jong Kook's massage...

2439
01:22:41,110 --> 01:22:42,810
goes to the end.

2440
01:22:43,370 --> 01:22:46,070
Kwang Soo's life-sized figure
belongs at the other end.

2441
01:22:46,070 --> 01:22:47,210
- Five.
- Yes.

2442
01:22:47,210 --> 01:22:48,210
Let's go!

2443
01:22:49,890 --> 01:22:52,450
(What did he get?)

2444
01:22:52,450 --> 01:22:53,560
Say it out loud. What number is it?

2445
01:22:55,490 --> 01:22:56,560
Five.

2446
01:22:56,560 --> 01:22:57,580
Kwang Soo!

2447
01:22:57,580 --> 01:22:59,950
(He wins a life-sized figure
of Kwang Soo.)

2448
01:23:00,750 --> 01:23:02,960
(He clenches his teeth.)

2449
01:23:04,200 --> 01:23:07,070
- At the end.
- Genius.

2450
01:23:07,740 --> 01:23:08,770
Genius.

2451
01:23:08,900 --> 01:23:12,110
- A life-sized figure of Kwang Soo.
- Genius.

2452
01:23:12,610 --> 01:23:14,310
I moved this.

2453
01:23:14,310 --> 01:23:15,850
I know. You moved it.

2454
01:23:15,850 --> 01:23:17,480
- Why was this here?
- He added it at the end.

2455
01:23:17,570 --> 01:23:19,150
- This.
- My gosh.

2456
01:23:19,150 --> 01:23:20,320
(Please take good care of it.)

2457
01:23:20,320 --> 01:23:21,710
You must take it.

2458
01:23:21,710 --> 01:23:23,690
So Min.

2459
01:23:24,540 --> 01:23:25,580
So Min.

2460
01:23:25,990 --> 01:23:27,020
What number is it?

2461
01:23:27,320 --> 01:23:28,320
Eight.

2462
01:23:28,320 --> 01:23:31,190
(She wins autographed name tags
of the members.)

2463
01:23:31,190 --> 01:23:32,620
- Autographed name tags.
- Oh, dear.

2464
01:23:32,920 --> 01:23:34,660
I don't want it.

2465
01:23:34,660 --> 01:23:36,790
So Min, sell them.

2466
01:23:37,490 --> 01:23:38,570
I'll buy.

2467
01:23:38,570 --> 01:23:39,990
Sell them.

2468
01:23:40,070 --> 01:23:42,160
- It's on her back.
- Let's see.

2469
01:23:42,200 --> 01:23:43,410
She'll fly away.

2470
01:23:43,410 --> 01:23:44,740
She's rich.

2471
01:23:44,770 --> 01:23:46,000
I don't think...

2472
01:23:46,000 --> 01:23:48,310
It's nothing again.

2473
01:23:48,310 --> 01:23:50,350
47. It's a dud.

2474
01:23:50,350 --> 01:23:51,670
That's better than mine.

2475
01:23:51,670 --> 01:23:53,650
Why? We should congratulate you.

2476
01:23:53,650 --> 01:23:55,890
Why would you congratulate me?
Where am I supposed to put this?

2477
01:23:55,990 --> 01:23:57,150
I want the set.

2478
01:23:57,410 --> 01:23:59,280
(Center Suk Jin picks last.)

2479
01:23:59,280 --> 01:24:00,390
He picked.

2480
01:24:01,210 --> 01:24:02,990
(What is it?)

2481
01:24:02,990 --> 01:24:04,530
1, 2, 3.

2482
01:24:04,530 --> 01:24:06,730
2... 21.

2483
01:24:06,730 --> 01:24:07,920
(21!)

2484
01:24:08,730 --> 01:24:09,920
Air fryer.

2485
01:24:09,920 --> 01:24:11,790
(He wins an air fryer.)

2486
01:24:11,790 --> 01:24:13,240
That's awesome.

2487
01:24:13,240 --> 01:24:14,960
This is the most economical.

2488
01:24:14,960 --> 01:24:16,570
You have an air fryer at home.

2489
01:24:16,570 --> 01:24:18,240
I do, but I had it
for over 10 years.

2490
01:24:18,410 --> 01:24:20,480
- Air fryers came out 10 years ago?
- Of course.

2491
01:24:21,110 --> 01:24:22,330
- Really?
- Be quiet.

2492
01:24:22,440 --> 01:24:25,000
I don't think they've been around
for 10 years.

2493
01:24:25,000 --> 01:24:26,980
- Maybe 7 or 8 years.
- Okay.

2494
01:24:26,980 --> 01:24:28,650
Air fryer!

2495
01:24:28,650 --> 01:24:29,950
(Suk Jin takes the air fryer!)

2496
01:24:29,950 --> 01:24:31,210
Good work.

2497
01:24:31,210 --> 01:24:33,450
(We would like to thank
ZICO, Seong Wu,)

2498
01:24:33,450 --> 01:24:35,410
(Do Hyun, and Ji Hun
for a great time.)

2499
01:24:36,660 --> 01:24:39,080
(With familiar faces
Hong Hyun Hee and Kim Ji Min)

2500
01:24:39,820 --> 01:24:42,160
(It's a lively atmosphere
like a team dinner.)

2501
01:24:42,730 --> 01:24:45,320
(But something's strange.)

2502
01:24:45,770 --> 01:24:47,640
(There are way too many cameras,)

2503
01:24:47,640 --> 01:24:49,830
(and people start disappearing
one at a time.)

2504
01:24:49,830 --> 01:24:51,330
(Will they go through the door...)

2505
01:24:51,330 --> 01:24:52,570
(or will there be resistance?)

2506
01:24:52,570 --> 01:24:54,810
(Nobody knows
what the consequences are.)

2507
01:24:55,850 --> 01:24:58,310
(Will they take the R coins
or leave it alone?)

2508
01:24:58,370 --> 01:25:00,610
(They have many options.)

2509
01:25:00,870 --> 01:25:02,950
(Will they win or lose?)

2510
01:25:02,950 --> 01:25:04,390
(You have to act
when nobody's looking.)

2511
01:25:04,450 --> 01:25:06,780
(The mystery stimulates
their curiosity.)

2512
01:25:07,210 --> 01:25:10,250
(This intense race has no answer.
How will it end?)

2513
01:25:10,530 --> 01:25:12,230
(Race Nobody Can Tell:
Hey, You Can Find Out Too!)
