1
00:00:05,350 --> 00:00:07,470
- Hello.
- Hello.

2
00:00:07,470 --> 00:00:08,910
Hello. Hi, guys.

3
00:00:08,950 --> 00:00:10,210
- Hey.
- This place is nice.

4
00:00:10,210 --> 00:00:12,360
- I changed my pants.
- The weather is nice.

5
00:00:12,360 --> 00:00:13,790
- Why are you guys being so...
- It's windy.

6
00:00:13,790 --> 00:00:14,790
- What?
- It's a lovely day.

7
00:00:14,790 --> 00:00:15,790
It's chilly in the morning.

8
00:00:15,790 --> 00:00:18,160
So Min says she doesn't feel cold.

9
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:19,630
But she has a hot pack on her back.

10
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:21,350
- A hot pack in May?
- What?

11
00:00:21,350 --> 00:00:22,760
Why would you
need a hot pack in May?

12
00:00:22,760 --> 00:00:24,890
The weather is nice today.

13
00:00:24,890 --> 00:00:26,890
There are Jong Kook and his manager.

14
00:00:26,890 --> 00:00:28,300
I guess he's got a new manager.

15
00:00:28,300 --> 00:00:30,030
- Isn't he the guy who does origami?
- He looks like a mischievous boy.

16
00:00:30,100 --> 00:00:31,460
They never wait for me.

17
00:00:31,460 --> 00:00:33,800
It's him. Hello, we're "boogers".

18
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:35,010
Is he today's guest?

19
00:00:35,010 --> 00:00:36,910
- He's the origami guy.
- Mr. Origami.

20
00:00:36,910 --> 00:00:38,010
I'm a big fan.

21
00:00:38,010 --> 00:00:39,410
Can I get your autograph?

22
00:00:39,410 --> 00:00:41,010
He's the guy who teaches us origami.

23
00:00:41,010 --> 00:00:42,310
- It's him.
- We saw him a lot in childhood.

24
00:00:42,310 --> 00:00:43,310
They called me the origami guy.

25
00:00:43,310 --> 00:00:44,750
- We're boogers.
- He's from the TV show.

26
00:00:44,750 --> 00:00:45,790
- Hello.
- I was a big fan.

27
00:00:45,790 --> 00:00:47,690
- It's the origami guy.
- Wow.

28
00:00:48,330 --> 00:00:49,580
Mr. Ji Young Man.

29
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:51,260
He's our guest for today.

30
00:00:51,620 --> 00:00:53,160
- Hello.
- Hello, Mr. Origami.

31
00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:54,400
It's him.

32
00:00:54,590 --> 00:00:56,660
- Hello.
- It's been a really long time.

33
00:00:56,730 --> 00:00:59,260
Hey, how could you call me
the origami guy?

34
00:00:59,260 --> 00:01:00,260
What?

35
00:01:00,260 --> 00:01:02,010
It's Suk Jin!

36
00:01:02,010 --> 00:01:03,470
What happened?

37
00:01:04,010 --> 00:01:05,770
- It's Suk Jin.
- Hello, kids.

38
00:01:05,770 --> 00:01:07,130
It was Suk Jin.

39
00:01:07,180 --> 00:01:08,270
Your outfit is too extreme.

40
00:01:08,270 --> 00:01:09,310
It's not extreme.

41
00:01:09,310 --> 00:01:11,780
You seemed quite close
with him over there.

42
00:01:12,110 --> 00:01:14,640
- How could he be like that?
- You're the same.

43
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:16,280
You're being extreme too.

44
00:01:16,280 --> 00:01:18,310
Everyone changes
in front of cameras.

45
00:01:18,310 --> 00:01:20,010
You're being extreme too.

46
00:01:20,010 --> 00:01:21,720
The seven of us are
attacking him all at once.

47
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:22,890
It's okay.

48
00:01:22,890 --> 00:01:24,720
He's like...

49
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:26,560
- Shirasoni.
- Shirasoni of a variety show.

50
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:27,890
He fights against several enemies.

51
00:01:27,890 --> 00:01:29,300
"Bring it on!"

52
00:01:29,300 --> 00:01:30,890
- He beats us all.
- He takes blows well.

53
00:01:30,890 --> 00:01:32,170
He's tough.

54
00:01:32,890 --> 00:01:34,300
All right.

55
00:01:34,300 --> 00:01:35,760
- What's that?
- What is it?

56
00:01:35,760 --> 00:01:36,940
- What about Ji Suk Jin?
- What's that?

57
00:01:36,940 --> 00:01:38,110
You said this
in "You Quiz on the Block ".

58
00:01:38,110 --> 00:01:39,730
I see. It just came up.

59
00:01:39,730 --> 00:01:41,910
Don't say that. We're not
your best friends for life.

60
00:01:41,910 --> 00:01:44,050
- We are best friends for life.
- We just live our own lives.

61
00:01:44,050 --> 00:01:45,110
I mentioned those two because...

62
00:01:45,110 --> 00:01:46,280
I know what you mean.

63
00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:47,510
- You know what I mean, right?
- Yes.

64
00:01:47,510 --> 00:01:48,840
I wasn't disappointed at all.

65
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:50,780
They are the people
whom I can control.

66
00:01:50,780 --> 00:01:52,310
- You can control them?
- We're not disappointed.

67
00:01:52,310 --> 00:01:55,010
- You all are my best friends.
- Sure.

68
00:01:55,010 --> 00:01:57,530
To put it bluntly, we're like
his well-trained dogs.

69
00:01:57,530 --> 00:01:58,560
(A best friend means
a well-trained dog.)

70
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:00,390
- Well-trained dogs.
- That sounds rough.

71
00:02:00,390 --> 00:02:02,330
- To put it bluntly.
- That's not true.

72
00:02:02,360 --> 00:02:04,090
You're like his pet dogs.

73
00:02:04,090 --> 00:02:05,200
Hey.

74
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:06,670
Do you know
whom you can't control here?

75
00:02:06,670 --> 00:02:08,030
- Who is it?
- It's her.

76
00:02:08,090 --> 00:02:10,340
If you call her, she will
call you back a week later.

77
00:02:11,030 --> 00:02:12,310
- "Did you call me?"
- Ji Hyo?

78
00:02:12,310 --> 00:02:14,180
I have no intention to control her.

79
00:02:14,470 --> 00:02:16,910
I texted her after our first
shooting of Running Man,

80
00:02:16,910 --> 00:02:18,100
but she hasn't texted me back.

81
00:02:18,750 --> 00:02:20,680
It's been 10 years,
but she hasn't replied yet.

82
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:23,810
- She's Cavewoman Ji Hyo indeed.
- Cavewoman Ji Hyo.

83
00:02:23,810 --> 00:02:26,720
Let me introduce our guests
who will join today's race.

84
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:28,060
- Okay.
- Do we have guests?

85
00:02:28,060 --> 00:02:29,960
- This is exciting.
- They are there.

86
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:31,790
(There are four guests who will
make today's race special.)

87
00:02:32,350 --> 00:02:33,750
Who are they? He's pretty tall.

88
00:02:33,750 --> 00:02:35,660
- It's Chang Wook.
- Oh, hello.

89
00:02:35,660 --> 00:02:37,090
Hey.

90
00:02:37,090 --> 00:02:38,790
- Chang Wook.
- Have you been doing well?

91
00:02:39,270 --> 00:02:40,500
Hello, Yoo Jung.

92
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:42,410
Chang Wook, it's been a long time.

93
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:45,740
(Ji Chang Wook, a clumsy
but good-looking manager)

94
00:02:45,740 --> 00:02:48,500
(A whimsical part-timer,
Kim Yoo Jung)

95
00:02:48,500 --> 00:02:51,210
(An unpredictable romantic comedy,
"Backstreet Rookie")

96
00:02:51,210 --> 00:02:53,840
(Han Sunhwa and Do Sang Woo
are in the middle of the story too.)

97
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:56,780
(The 4 protagonists
of the drama are here.)

98
00:02:56,780 --> 00:02:58,850
They are the protagonists
of the upcoming SBS drama.

99
00:02:58,850 --> 00:02:59,910
"Backstreet Rookie".

100
00:03:00,060 --> 00:03:01,380
Are you their manager or something?

101
00:03:01,380 --> 00:03:02,990
- What are you talking about?
- Are you their manager?

102
00:03:02,990 --> 00:03:04,280
- Why would you say that?
- They are supposed to talk.

103
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:06,350
- Stay out of this.
- The title is "Backstreet Rookie".

104
00:03:06,350 --> 00:03:07,690
- Hang on.
- "Backstreet Rookie"?

105
00:03:07,690 --> 00:03:09,290
Sunhwa, are you going
somewhere after the opening?

106
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:12,400
- She brought her bag.
- Why did you bring your bag?

107
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:13,770
- What's that bag?
- It's for my fashion.

108
00:03:13,770 --> 00:03:15,470
- It's a fashion item.
- I see.

109
00:03:15,470 --> 00:03:17,630
It looks like she's going somewhere.

110
00:03:17,630 --> 00:03:18,810
After shooting the opening.

111
00:03:18,810 --> 00:03:21,180
Yoo Jung, you're dressed
comfortably. You look nice.

112
00:03:21,180 --> 00:03:22,910
Yoo Jung is dressed comfortably,

113
00:03:22,910 --> 00:03:24,570
- but what's wrong with you?
- Mind your outfit.

114
00:03:24,570 --> 00:03:26,470
- It makes me dizzy.
- You know the origami guy, right?

115
00:03:26,470 --> 00:03:27,470
- The origami guy.
- We are boogers.

116
00:03:27,470 --> 00:03:29,020
- Yoo Jung wouldn't know him.
- I'm trying to look young...

117
00:03:29,020 --> 00:03:30,720
because of Yoo Jung.

118
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:32,220
You look even younger than her.

119
00:03:32,220 --> 00:03:34,120
You're dressed like a newborn baby.

120
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:36,460
Are you opening a sushi bar
or something, Sang Woo?

121
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:39,400
You look...

122
00:03:39,930 --> 00:03:41,400
It also looks like
a taekwondo uniform.

123
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:42,660
- I know.
- It looks like a uniform.

124
00:03:42,660 --> 00:03:44,000
- Martial arts uniform.
- I know.

125
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,060
Good. We have Chang Wook here.

126
00:03:46,060 --> 00:03:47,900
There are many celebrities
who have Ji as their surnames.

127
00:03:47,900 --> 00:03:50,160
- And he's one of them.
- He's very handsome.

128
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:52,740
He's my junior from high school.

129
00:03:52,740 --> 00:03:53,940
- Really?
- In Anyang.

130
00:03:53,940 --> 00:03:55,570
We went to Shinsung High School.

131
00:03:55,570 --> 00:03:56,780
Shinsung High School?

132
00:03:56,780 --> 00:03:59,910
(He suddenly starts to sing
the school song.)

133
00:03:59,910 --> 00:04:01,280
Nice.

134
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:02,540
- We went to the same school.
- Was it a school song?

135
00:04:02,540 --> 00:04:03,750
Yes, it was.

136
00:04:03,910 --> 00:04:04,910
(He's being childish.)

137
00:04:04,910 --> 00:04:06,410
I thought that's what you said.

138
00:04:06,410 --> 00:04:07,850
Are you kidding me?

139
00:04:07,850 --> 00:04:10,430
I'm sorry. It's my fault.

140
00:04:10,690 --> 00:04:12,250
It just sounded like that.

141
00:04:12,250 --> 00:04:13,720
Is it your real name?

142
00:04:14,190 --> 00:04:15,190
Yes.

143
00:04:15,190 --> 00:04:17,270
- The Chungju Ji Clan?
- Yes.

144
00:04:17,270 --> 00:04:18,770
Maybe I should trace my genealogy.

145
00:04:18,770 --> 00:04:20,900
You'll get some colored paper today.

146
00:04:20,900 --> 00:04:22,800
(You'll get some
colored paper today.)

147
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:25,160
(Booger Chang Wook will
get some colored paper.)

148
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:26,170
Because he's the origami guy.

149
00:04:26,170 --> 00:04:28,100
He will get a hundred
origami cranes.

150
00:04:28,100 --> 00:04:30,040
Or origami turtles.

151
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:31,710
Have you been in a drama
with So Min before?

152
00:04:31,710 --> 00:04:32,780
- No.
- Not even once?

153
00:04:32,780 --> 00:04:33,910
No. I don't think we've met.

154
00:04:33,910 --> 00:04:35,220
- Is this your first time?
- You haven't met before?

155
00:04:35,220 --> 00:04:36,520
I did a drama with him.

156
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:38,820
- With Kwang Soo?
- What was the drama?

157
00:04:38,820 --> 00:04:40,610
It was "Bachelor's Vegetable Store".

158
00:04:40,610 --> 00:04:41,610
(We did the drama called
"Bachelor's Vegetable Store".)

159
00:04:41,610 --> 00:04:42,830
- You were the vegetable man.
- Yes.

160
00:04:42,830 --> 00:04:44,350
- Right?
- "Bachelor's Vegetable Store".

161
00:04:44,350 --> 00:04:46,590
(They've found the prey.)

162
00:04:46,590 --> 00:04:47,990
- Right?
- Yes.

163
00:04:47,990 --> 00:04:49,570
You were the eggplant.

164
00:04:49,570 --> 00:04:50,700
- Vegetables.
- You were the cucumber.

165
00:04:50,700 --> 00:04:51,790
He was a vegetable.

166
00:04:51,790 --> 00:04:53,030
No, he was a dried radish.

167
00:04:53,030 --> 00:04:54,090
(Spitting)

168
00:04:54,700 --> 00:04:55,770
(The vegetable man
explodes with anger.)

169
00:04:55,770 --> 00:04:57,470
- He was a dried radish.
- He was a Chinese yam.

170
00:04:57,470 --> 00:04:59,410
- Vegetables.
- That's what he was.

171
00:04:59,410 --> 00:05:00,800
At a vegetable store...

172
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:01,800
He was a bamboo shoot.

173
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:03,710
- Green onion.
- An apple box.

174
00:05:03,710 --> 00:05:05,210
A shishito pepper.

175
00:05:05,210 --> 00:05:06,280
A shishito pepper?

176
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:08,910
I hate it when the three of them
are standing together.

177
00:05:08,950 --> 00:05:10,480
- I feel much better now.
- Celery.

178
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:11,650
- That's what he looks like.
- Celery.

179
00:05:11,650 --> 00:05:12,780
Celery tastes good though.

180
00:05:12,780 --> 00:05:14,280
Be patient.

181
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:16,350
- Patient?
- Corn that's gone bad.

182
00:05:16,350 --> 00:05:19,990
Please tell us about your new drama,
Yoo Jung and Sunhwa.

183
00:05:19,990 --> 00:05:21,090
It's been a long time, Yoo Jung.

184
00:05:21,090 --> 00:05:25,070
The title of our new drama is
"Backstreet Rookie".

185
00:05:25,290 --> 00:05:27,400
I play the manager there.

186
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:28,600
The manager.

187
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:30,360
- What about you, Yoo Jung?
- I'm a part-timer.

188
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:32,210
She's a part-timer.
It sounds about right.

189
00:05:32,210 --> 00:05:35,100
I work at the head office
of the convenience store chain.

190
00:05:35,100 --> 00:05:36,210
What about you, Sang Woo?

191
00:05:36,210 --> 00:05:38,040
I'm the director at the head office.

192
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:39,540
- I see.
- He's the director.

193
00:05:39,540 --> 00:05:41,720
- So who's the rookie?
- The rookie.

194
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:43,020
Isn't it obvious? Gosh.

195
00:05:43,020 --> 00:05:44,910
It's obvious who the rookie is.

196
00:05:45,020 --> 00:05:46,760
- Hey.
- Suk Jin.

197
00:05:46,760 --> 00:05:48,280
You're dressed like a rookie today.

198
00:05:48,280 --> 00:05:49,530
You're the rookie.

199
00:05:49,590 --> 00:05:50,780
It's the rookie look.

200
00:05:50,780 --> 00:05:52,590
- You're dressed like a rookie.
- Hey.

201
00:05:52,590 --> 00:05:53,720
Hey, kid.

202
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:55,260
He seems to like it.

203
00:05:55,260 --> 00:05:56,990
He's the rookie.

204
00:05:56,990 --> 00:05:58,530
All right.

205
00:05:58,530 --> 00:06:00,360
Please give the four of them
a big hand then.

206
00:06:02,210 --> 00:06:04,660
Before I explain the rules,

207
00:06:04,660 --> 00:06:06,800
you will decide your teams.

208
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:08,530
- Please bring in the mats first.
- Mats?

209
00:06:08,530 --> 00:06:09,580
What?

210
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:11,880
Everyone.

211
00:06:12,020 --> 00:06:14,910
There will be 4 groups of 3 members.

212
00:06:14,910 --> 00:06:17,020
The guests will wait in the square.

213
00:06:17,020 --> 00:06:20,280
And the members will jump into
the square of the guest they want.

214
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:22,590
Once three of you get together,
you're a team.

215
00:06:22,590 --> 00:06:23,980
- What if we bounce off?
- If you bounce off,

216
00:06:23,980 --> 00:06:25,260
you will have to try again
at the end.

217
00:06:25,260 --> 00:06:27,590
- At the end?
- Okay. Please stand in the squares.

218
00:06:27,660 --> 00:06:28,770
Which team should I pick?

219
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:32,090
All right then. Ji Hyo
and So Min will go first.

220
00:06:32,290 --> 00:06:33,970
So Min, you go first.

221
00:06:33,990 --> 00:06:35,470
- Me?
- So Min.

222
00:06:35,770 --> 00:06:37,210
What should I do?

223
00:06:37,770 --> 00:06:39,880
- Whom should I pick?
- I know.

224
00:06:39,880 --> 00:06:41,880
I feel uncomfortable to go first.

225
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:45,010
Can we ask who they want
for their teams?

226
00:06:45,010 --> 00:06:47,240
Gosh, it's so old-fashioned.

227
00:06:47,320 --> 00:06:48,540
Mr. Origami!

228
00:06:48,540 --> 00:06:49,910
You're dressed
in an old-fashioned way.

229
00:06:49,910 --> 00:06:51,610
I just don't know where to go.

230
00:06:51,910 --> 00:06:54,820
Does anyone of you want me
to be your team?

231
00:06:54,820 --> 00:06:56,330
- Yoo Jung wants you.
- Yoo Jung.

232
00:06:56,330 --> 00:06:57,980
- Cool.
- Yoo Jung.

233
00:06:58,030 --> 00:06:59,720
- If they raise their hands...
- You keep staying...

234
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:00,760
around Chang Wook.

235
00:07:00,990 --> 00:07:01,990
You were there only for a moment.

236
00:07:01,990 --> 00:07:03,990
She wouldn't go over there.

237
00:07:03,990 --> 00:07:06,590
You keep staying around him.
Don't pretend to hesitate.

238
00:07:06,590 --> 00:07:08,290
Just go to him.

239
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:09,470
Just go.

240
00:07:09,470 --> 00:07:11,270
I want you two to play
rock-paper-scissors.

241
00:07:11,270 --> 00:07:13,280
Why? It doesn't even matter.

242
00:07:13,510 --> 00:07:14,780
Rock-paper-scissors.

243
00:07:14,780 --> 00:07:16,100
(Sang Woo wins.)

244
00:07:16,740 --> 00:07:18,650
You don't even care who wins.

245
00:07:18,650 --> 00:07:19,910
Are you going to the winner?

246
00:07:19,910 --> 00:07:21,410
He won. He won me.

247
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:22,720
I should go to him.

248
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:23,740
I feel bad for him.

249
00:07:23,740 --> 00:07:25,110
He won me.

250
00:07:25,110 --> 00:07:26,610
- I should go to him.
- What?

251
00:07:26,610 --> 00:07:28,050
I should step on the square.

252
00:07:28,050 --> 00:07:29,630
You can push her
if you don't like her.

253
00:07:30,090 --> 00:07:32,330
I'll go to Chang Wook.

254
00:07:32,330 --> 00:07:33,700
You can push her out.

255
00:07:34,090 --> 00:07:35,350
- He didn't push me.
- This is only the beginning.

256
00:07:35,350 --> 00:07:36,830
- He can't push you.
- Right.

257
00:07:36,830 --> 00:07:38,290
- He can't do it from the beginning.
- Who's next?

258
00:07:38,290 --> 00:07:39,400
Jong Kook goes next.

259
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:40,930
(Next up is Jong Kook.)

260
00:07:40,930 --> 00:07:42,570
Who would push you out?

261
00:07:42,570 --> 00:07:44,640
- I know.
- You can just hold out.

262
00:07:44,640 --> 00:07:45,780
Okay.

263
00:07:45,780 --> 00:07:47,840
I was going to pick
my high school junior.

264
00:07:48,100 --> 00:07:50,740
Chang Wook is fine with it,
but Ji Hyo doesn't want you.

265
00:07:50,740 --> 00:07:52,040
Ji Hyo doesn't like me.

266
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:54,020
He wants to take care
of his junior from Anyang.

267
00:07:54,020 --> 00:07:55,910
But Ji Hyo is about to kick you out.

268
00:07:56,740 --> 00:07:59,460
Gosh, I think Ji Hyo
is going to kick me out.

269
00:08:00,760 --> 00:08:02,850
I'm interested in the sushi bar too.

270
00:08:02,850 --> 00:08:04,660
- It's a nice place.
- It's a nice place.

271
00:08:04,660 --> 00:08:05,990
It's not bad.

272
00:08:05,990 --> 00:08:08,830
I think Sang Woo...
How should I explain this?

273
00:08:08,830 --> 00:08:10,090
- I think he's like us.
- Right.

274
00:08:10,090 --> 00:08:11,920
Judging from the way you look,
I think you'll be like us.

275
00:08:11,990 --> 00:08:15,070
- And he looks a bit clumsy.
- I know.

276
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:16,410
- He does.
- He looks...

277
00:08:16,410 --> 00:08:17,800
a bit like Maeng Gu.

278
00:08:18,230 --> 00:08:19,710
He's a handsome version
of Maeng Gu.

279
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:20,930
I know what you mean.

280
00:08:20,930 --> 00:08:23,600
- How can Chil Deuk say that?
- I already feel close to him.

281
00:08:24,280 --> 00:08:26,110
He does remind me of Kwang Soo.

282
00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:27,720
- I like him.
- First...

283
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:30,780
- Are you going there?
- All right.

284
00:08:32,040 --> 00:08:33,110
This is good.

285
00:08:33,110 --> 00:08:34,160
So Min...

286
00:08:34,890 --> 00:08:38,180
(Jong Kook is pushed away.)

287
00:08:38,580 --> 00:08:41,290
(So Min panics,
and Sang Woo holds Jong Kook.)

288
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,370
- She pushed him away.
- That's not it.

289
00:08:43,370 --> 00:08:44,500
And Sang Woo caught him.

290
00:08:44,660 --> 00:08:46,100
So Min pushed him away,
but Sang Woo caught him.

291
00:08:46,100 --> 00:08:47,400
(What?)

292
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:48,600
- I mean...
- Okay, I get it.

293
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:50,800
You said you wanted Jae Suk
on your team.

294
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:53,640
So Min is
in an awkward situation now.

295
00:08:54,330 --> 00:08:55,570
She got caught.

296
00:08:55,570 --> 00:08:57,040
All right.

297
00:08:57,040 --> 00:08:58,570
- Go.
- It's my turn now.

298
00:08:58,570 --> 00:09:00,040
- You're choosing between the two.
- I'm choosing between...

299
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:01,570
- Yoo Jung and Sunhwa.
- I know.

300
00:09:01,570 --> 00:09:03,890
- I'm not even looking at the guys.
- I can't decide.

301
00:09:03,910 --> 00:09:05,710
Are you sure
you don't need any knee pads?

302
00:09:06,390 --> 00:09:08,210
- You might hurt yourself.
- Put a helmet on him!

303
00:09:08,210 --> 00:09:10,680
Guys, as soon as I join a team,

304
00:09:10,860 --> 00:09:12,630
I'll manage the team closely.

305
00:09:12,920 --> 00:09:14,630
- Who do you think you are?
- I'll manage the team closely.

306
00:09:14,860 --> 00:09:16,060
Keep that in mind.

307
00:09:16,270 --> 00:09:18,730
I'll manage my team very closely.

308
00:09:18,770 --> 00:09:20,060
I choose Yoo Jung.

309
00:09:20,060 --> 00:09:21,270
(The strict man chooses Yoo Jung.)

310
00:09:21,270 --> 00:09:22,640
- You're not pushing him away?
- You're not pushing him away?

311
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:24,010
Okay!

312
00:09:24,140 --> 00:09:25,270
All of them are so nice.

313
00:09:25,270 --> 00:09:26,910
- You're the first person, so...
- Okay.

314
00:09:26,910 --> 00:09:28,530
I've made myself clear.

315
00:09:28,530 --> 00:09:30,410
- Gosh, I'm the last one.
- It's my turn.

316
00:09:30,410 --> 00:09:32,620
(It's Se Chan's turn.)

317
00:09:32,710 --> 00:09:33,880
- Se Chan...
- I'll jump...

318
00:09:33,880 --> 00:09:35,780
Please don't feel hurt.

319
00:09:35,780 --> 00:09:36,990
What's with...

320
00:09:37,520 --> 00:09:38,620
his outfit today?

321
00:09:39,490 --> 00:09:40,710
- Is it me now?
- No.

322
00:09:40,780 --> 00:09:42,920
Is this the problem?

323
00:09:43,050 --> 00:09:44,180
- That looks better.
- That looks better.

324
00:09:44,180 --> 00:09:45,790
- That looks better.
- This looks better?

325
00:09:45,790 --> 00:09:47,400
Let me have a word with Yoo Jung.

326
00:09:48,500 --> 00:09:49,730
- Gosh, I can't stand him.
- Okay.

327
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:51,630
- Did she decide?
- Yes.

328
00:09:51,790 --> 00:09:53,830
That role suits him so well.

329
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:56,830
Jump, jump, jump...

330
00:09:56,830 --> 00:10:00,140
(Strict defense)

331
00:10:00,430 --> 00:10:02,940
(Se Chan is pushed away.)

332
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:05,650
Who are you to push me away?

333
00:10:05,650 --> 00:10:06,910
Yoo Jung was okay with you,

334
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:08,210
but I don't like you.

335
00:10:08,810 --> 00:10:10,180
You pushed my mouth!

336
00:10:10,540 --> 00:10:12,490
I didn't mean to...

337
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:15,520
(What?)

338
00:10:15,520 --> 00:10:20,130
(What? Jae Suk got pushed out?)

339
00:10:20,130 --> 00:10:22,730
Jae Suk got pushed out.

340
00:10:22,730 --> 00:10:24,000
Nice!

341
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,140
- Good job!
- We should decide together.

342
00:10:26,140 --> 00:10:27,900
- I said I like Se Chan.
- I can't believe this.

343
00:10:27,900 --> 00:10:29,740
- You didn't even let me catch him.
- You said you like me?

344
00:10:29,830 --> 00:10:31,460
- Jae Suk!
- He was only pretending.

345
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:33,430
(Yoo Jung is even stricter
than Jae Suk.)

346
00:10:33,430 --> 00:10:34,530
- I mean...
- Suk Jin.

347
00:10:34,530 --> 00:10:36,110
- I'll go for Sunhwa.
- I'll go for Sunhwa.

348
00:10:36,110 --> 00:10:37,380
- We should choose Sunhwa.
- We should.

349
00:10:37,380 --> 00:10:38,780
Otherwise, she'd feel hurt.

350
00:10:39,780 --> 00:10:41,070
I'm coming.

351
00:10:41,710 --> 00:10:42,910
Leave a spot for me.

352
00:10:42,910 --> 00:10:44,350
- Well...
- Now?

353
00:10:44,580 --> 00:10:45,950
- Sunhwa, leave a spot for me.
- Sunhwa.

354
00:10:45,950 --> 00:10:47,050
Don't feel hurt.

355
00:10:47,050 --> 00:10:48,120
They only chose Yoo Jung
to be funny.

356
00:10:48,520 --> 00:10:50,680
- Don't feel hurt.
- They were trying to be funny.

357
00:10:50,680 --> 00:10:51,990
- That's why.
- We just wanted to be funny.

358
00:10:52,290 --> 00:10:53,450
It's not your fault.

359
00:10:53,450 --> 00:10:55,550
- I feel even more hurt now.
- Sunhwa.

360
00:10:55,550 --> 00:10:57,060
I was feeling okay.

361
00:10:57,060 --> 00:10:59,740
I didn't feel hurt.
Why are you doing this?

362
00:10:59,740 --> 00:11:01,290
- Sunhwa is the best.
- Sunhwa.

363
00:11:01,290 --> 00:11:02,960
- They were just trying to be funny.
- I'm coming, okay?

364
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:04,460
We have to go to Yoo Jung
to be funny.

365
00:11:04,460 --> 00:11:06,800
- Sunhwa likes to have space.
- I'm doing great.

366
00:11:06,980 --> 00:11:09,700
I'm the one who made her a star
on "Star Golden Bell".

367
00:11:09,700 --> 00:11:11,280
- Who?
- Sunhwa.

368
00:11:11,280 --> 00:11:12,350
You did?

369
00:11:12,350 --> 00:11:14,170
You didn't become a star
on that show yourself.

370
00:11:15,850 --> 00:11:16,990
What are you talking about?

371
00:11:16,990 --> 00:11:18,520
(Suk Jin was the only one
who didn't become a star.)

372
00:11:18,520 --> 00:11:19,660
- Seriously...
- All right.

373
00:11:19,660 --> 00:11:21,360
(Suk Jin is getting ready to jump
to Sunhwa.)

374
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:22,390
You don't look so happy.

375
00:11:22,390 --> 00:11:26,690
(Right then...)

376
00:11:26,690 --> 00:11:27,790
It's not like that.

377
00:11:27,790 --> 00:11:29,160
(Suk Jin's T-shirt stretches.)

378
00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:31,290
(Jumping)

379
00:11:31,870 --> 00:11:34,770
(This is how you make it funny.)

380
00:11:35,740 --> 00:11:37,740
- That was hilarious.
- The situation was funny.

381
00:11:38,330 --> 00:11:39,980
How did he jump like this?

382
00:11:39,980 --> 00:11:42,110
- That was funny.
- He jumped 3cm.

383
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:43,440
(Instead of choosing a team,
Suk Jin only made people laugh.)

384
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:45,410
Go back to your place.
Let's do this again.

385
00:11:45,410 --> 00:11:47,020
- Let's do it again.
- I failed?

386
00:11:47,020 --> 00:11:48,170
He failed?

387
00:11:48,250 --> 00:11:49,410
You failed.

388
00:11:49,410 --> 00:11:50,520
(Annoying)

389
00:11:50,810 --> 00:11:52,310
(How long will this go on?)

390
00:11:52,310 --> 00:11:53,550
This is never going to end.

391
00:11:54,390 --> 00:11:55,660
This is never going to end.

392
00:11:56,030 --> 00:11:57,130
Oh, that's the wrong direction.

393
00:11:57,420 --> 00:11:58,580
He went to Yoo Jung instead.

394
00:11:59,400 --> 00:12:01,550
(Jae Suk tries
Yoo Jung's team again.)

395
00:12:01,550 --> 00:12:02,690
- Sunhwa would feel hurt.
- "Oh, that's the wrong direction."

396
00:12:02,690 --> 00:12:04,500
I was going to push him away.

397
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:06,660
- You were going to?
- Gosh.

398
00:12:06,660 --> 00:12:08,100
- He's annoying, right?
- I jumped in the wrong direction.

399
00:12:08,100 --> 00:12:09,240
I'll definitely choose Sunhwa.

400
00:12:09,660 --> 00:12:11,240
- Jump, jump, jump.
- Jump, jump, jump.

401
00:12:11,240 --> 00:12:13,280
(Se Chan jumps into
Sunhwa's box.)

402
00:12:13,280 --> 00:12:14,380
She didn't push him away.

403
00:12:14,830 --> 00:12:16,300
- Next up is Kwang Soo.
- Yes.

404
00:12:16,700 --> 00:12:19,940
(Is it my turn now?)

405
00:12:21,210 --> 00:12:22,410
Here comes celery.

406
00:12:22,890 --> 00:12:24,310
- He's only interested in two teams.
- A shishito pepper.

407
00:12:25,180 --> 00:12:26,580
Hey, no one is getting nervous.

408
00:12:27,210 --> 00:12:28,450
No one cares.

409
00:12:28,450 --> 00:12:29,630
(Which team will Kwang Soo choose?)

410
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:31,320
(Jae Suk slaps his face.)

411
00:12:33,950 --> 00:12:36,660
(It becomes funny again.)

412
00:12:37,460 --> 00:12:40,100
(Where did Kwang Soo land?)

413
00:12:40,370 --> 00:12:41,460
You're in.

414
00:12:41,460 --> 00:12:42,610
No, I'm not.

415
00:12:42,960 --> 00:12:44,010
I'm not in.

416
00:12:44,010 --> 00:12:45,430
- You're in.
- I'm not.

417
00:12:45,430 --> 00:12:46,780
- You're in.
- No.

418
00:12:46,780 --> 00:12:48,010
You're in.

419
00:12:48,170 --> 00:12:50,150
- This is not okay.
- Good job.

420
00:12:50,850 --> 00:12:52,200
You landed right in there.

421
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:53,650
(I saw it.)

422
00:12:53,650 --> 00:12:55,040
- You're in, Kwang Soo.
- You went right in.

423
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:56,910
- I wasn't even considering.
- You're in.

424
00:12:56,910 --> 00:12:58,150
I like this team too.

425
00:12:58,150 --> 00:12:59,860
I like this team too, but...

426
00:12:59,990 --> 00:13:01,160
Is it my turn?

427
00:13:01,160 --> 00:13:02,260
Here we go.

428
00:13:02,260 --> 00:13:03,730
(It's Haha's turn.)

429
00:13:04,230 --> 00:13:06,050
(I didn't get pushed out.)

430
00:13:06,050 --> 00:13:07,290
- Good.
- Then I'll join this team.

431
00:13:07,290 --> 00:13:08,550
- Hold on. What?
- He got pushed out.

432
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,320
- Why did you push him out?
- He was in.

433
00:13:10,790 --> 00:13:12,160
Let's just end it here.

434
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:13,930
Didn't we agree to push him?

435
00:13:13,930 --> 00:13:15,560
I get kicked out and that's it?

436
00:13:16,460 --> 00:13:17,910
- You're in.
- You're in.

437
00:13:17,910 --> 00:13:19,240
- You're in.
- Haha!

438
00:13:19,240 --> 00:13:20,880
- Haha!
- Is Haha by himself?

439
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:22,070
- We're sorry.
- Don't worry.

440
00:13:22,070 --> 00:13:23,910
That was a mistake.
I thought it was Suk Jin.

441
00:13:24,910 --> 00:13:28,620
(Team Selection Result)

442
00:13:28,750 --> 00:13:32,950
With today's guests, who are playing
convenience store employees,

443
00:13:32,950 --> 00:13:34,710
we'll have Convenience Store
Hot Item Race.

444
00:13:35,180 --> 00:13:38,550
The four guests will be
the branch manager of each team.

445
00:13:38,550 --> 00:13:40,130
- They're the branch managers.
- They're the branch managers.

446
00:13:40,660 --> 00:13:41,790
In today's race,

447
00:13:41,790 --> 00:13:44,130
you have to guess
the most popular items...

448
00:13:44,130 --> 00:13:45,630
sold at convenience stores...

449
00:13:45,730 --> 00:13:48,660
and try to get as many of them.

450
00:13:48,870 --> 00:13:51,510
There are top 15 items...

451
00:13:51,510 --> 00:13:54,010
and 25 randomly chosen items,

452
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:56,380
and they have different points
according to their sales rankings.

453
00:13:56,700 --> 00:13:59,440
After each mission,
you get to choose items.

454
00:13:59,650 --> 00:14:02,150
At the end, the points from
each item will be added up,

455
00:14:02,150 --> 00:14:04,890
and the two teams with
the highest score will win prizes.

456
00:14:05,410 --> 00:14:08,120
One more thing. There are...

457
00:14:08,210 --> 00:14:10,280
- two brokers among you.
- What?

458
00:14:10,280 --> 00:14:11,420
- What?
- Brokers?

459
00:14:11,420 --> 00:14:14,050
(There are two brokers among them.)

460
00:14:14,690 --> 00:14:16,770
Hey. Are you a broker?

461
00:14:17,320 --> 00:14:18,820
- Stop acting.
- A broker?

462
00:14:19,270 --> 00:14:20,330
You're not a broker, are you?

463
00:14:21,100 --> 00:14:22,270
I can't believe you.

464
00:14:22,370 --> 00:14:24,910
We're going to choose
the two brokers randomly.

465
00:14:24,910 --> 00:14:26,480
- Really?
- It's not decided yet.

466
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:29,280
- We're going to choose them now.
- I'm sorry.

467
00:14:29,280 --> 00:14:30,480
- See?
- I'm sorry.

468
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:33,040
I saw the old look in her eyes.

469
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:34,150
Gosh.

470
00:14:34,150 --> 00:14:35,250
She's scary.

471
00:14:35,670 --> 00:14:37,850
- What's with you?
- The two brokers...

472
00:14:38,250 --> 00:14:39,860
will carry out hidden missions...

473
00:14:39,860 --> 00:14:42,920
and propose a deal
to a team of their choice.

474
00:14:43,550 --> 00:14:45,550
After each mission,

475
00:14:45,550 --> 00:14:48,730
the proposals will be announced.

476
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:52,740
If the team accepts the deal,

477
00:14:52,900 --> 00:14:55,600
they can choose an additional item.

478
00:14:56,060 --> 00:14:58,870
At the same time, the broker
will win another item too.

479
00:14:59,010 --> 00:15:02,480
If the team turns down the deal,
they get no additional item...

480
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:04,170
but can win a hint about the broker.

481
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:08,480
If a team manages to catch
a broker using the hints,

482
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:10,940
they'll get a chance
to turn the game around.

483
00:15:10,940 --> 00:15:12,210
- We'll have to make a choice.
- If we turn down a deal...

484
00:15:12,210 --> 00:15:14,660
So there are 2 brokers and 4 teams.

485
00:15:14,660 --> 00:15:16,260
They'll compete against each other,

486
00:15:16,260 --> 00:15:18,180
and the top two teams
will win prizes.

487
00:15:18,630 --> 00:15:20,260
Let's choose two brokers now.

488
00:15:20,530 --> 00:15:21,790
- We choose them randomly?
- Yes.

489
00:15:21,860 --> 00:15:23,270
- We choose them?
- Each of you will draw one.

490
00:15:23,630 --> 00:15:26,000
- Let's start.
- Two of them will say, "Broker".

491
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,240
(They choose two brokers randomly.)

492
00:15:27,530 --> 00:15:29,370
I usually choose the one left.

493
00:15:29,870 --> 00:15:32,010
I want to choose the one left.

494
00:15:32,830 --> 00:15:34,380
(Even the brokers don't know
who the other broker is.)

495
00:15:34,380 --> 00:15:37,800
(They have to compete
against each other too.)

496
00:15:38,040 --> 00:15:40,150
(The two brokers are given
hidden missions.)

497
00:15:40,150 --> 00:15:41,210
All right.

498
00:15:41,310 --> 00:15:44,710
(Which of them are the 2 brokers?)

499
00:15:44,810 --> 00:15:47,260
- I'll see you at the next spot.
- Okay.

500
00:15:47,260 --> 00:15:48,710
(They change and move
to the next mission spot.)

501
00:15:48,950 --> 00:15:50,950
Who could be the brokers?

502
00:15:50,950 --> 00:15:52,320
I know they're not on my team.

503
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,230
So Min, I think the broker thing
is too complicated.

504
00:15:55,230 --> 00:15:56,320
What do you mean?

505
00:15:56,420 --> 00:15:59,240
If the broker's deal is accepted,
he or she wins another item.

506
00:15:59,240 --> 00:16:00,430
What if it's turned down?

507
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:01,960
But what are you worried about?

508
00:16:01,960 --> 00:16:04,010
As a broker, you just have to
propose a deal.

509
00:16:04,140 --> 00:16:05,370
Gosh.

510
00:16:05,370 --> 00:16:06,930
(Shocked)

511
00:16:06,930 --> 00:16:08,300
- You're scary.
- Right?

512
00:16:08,300 --> 00:16:09,650
You're scary.

513
00:16:09,650 --> 00:16:10,650
You are a broker.

514
00:16:10,650 --> 00:16:12,380
So Min. Seriously...

515
00:16:12,380 --> 00:16:14,170
How can you be so shameless?
You're a broker.

516
00:16:14,170 --> 00:16:15,570
- How dare you?
- You're scary.

517
00:16:15,570 --> 00:16:16,650
You're scary.

518
00:16:16,650 --> 00:16:19,310
Even innocent people
are suspected here.

519
00:16:19,580 --> 00:16:21,780
You haven't been on this show
in so long.

520
00:16:22,080 --> 00:16:23,580
You're really scary.

521
00:16:25,280 --> 00:16:26,360
You are a broker.

522
00:16:26,660 --> 00:16:27,950
Ji Hyo.

523
00:16:28,550 --> 00:16:31,160
- Something didn't feel right.
- Sunhwa is a broker.

524
00:16:31,160 --> 00:16:32,320
- She's a broker?
- Yes.

525
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:33,740
No, I'm not.

526
00:16:33,740 --> 00:16:35,930
But Se Chan and Haha...

527
00:16:36,140 --> 00:16:37,740
That sounds tough, right?
They're on her team.

528
00:16:37,740 --> 00:16:39,530
What are they like?

529
00:16:39,530 --> 00:16:40,530
(Ji Hyo sighs.)

530
00:16:40,530 --> 00:16:41,570
Don't trust them.

531
00:16:41,780 --> 00:16:43,510
Don't let them sweet-talk you.

532
00:16:43,650 --> 00:16:44,700
- You think so?
- Yes.

533
00:16:44,910 --> 00:16:46,040
Don't trust So Min.

534
00:16:46,620 --> 00:16:48,070
- I can't trust anyone?
- I'm different.

535
00:16:48,070 --> 00:16:50,350
- I'm different.
- So Min is the most dangerous one.

536
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:52,390
- Are you buckled up?
- Are you buckled up?

537
00:16:52,390 --> 00:16:53,580
- Yes.
- They'll shoot us eating too?

538
00:16:53,580 --> 00:16:55,390
- Sunhwa, are you buckled up?
- Yes, I am.

539
00:16:55,450 --> 00:16:57,890
Those cup noodles looked so tasty.

540
00:16:58,050 --> 00:16:59,320
- Chapaghetti too.
- I want Chapaghetti.

541
00:16:59,320 --> 00:17:01,130
I'm sure they're
some of the top-selling items.

542
00:17:01,230 --> 00:17:02,790
Definitely.

543
00:17:02,790 --> 00:17:04,660
The numbers are from 2019...

544
00:17:04,660 --> 00:17:06,290
- and this year.
- 2019?

545
00:17:06,290 --> 00:17:07,370
- They're from the past year?
- That's recent.

546
00:17:07,370 --> 00:17:09,430
And we're talking about
the number of units sold.

547
00:17:09,430 --> 00:17:10,460
- The number of units sold.
- The number of units sold.

548
00:17:10,460 --> 00:17:13,930
I'd guess Yoo Jung goes to
convenience stores often.

549
00:17:13,930 --> 00:17:15,140
- I do.
- Right?

550
00:17:15,140 --> 00:17:16,580
Young people go there a lot.

551
00:17:16,580 --> 00:17:18,440
What's the first thing
you pick up there?

552
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:20,210
- Bottled water.
- Bottled water.

553
00:17:20,210 --> 00:17:22,210
Many people buy bottled water
at convenience stores.

554
00:17:22,210 --> 00:17:23,480
- I often buy bottled water.
- They do.

555
00:17:23,480 --> 00:17:25,180
Or Coke.

556
00:17:25,290 --> 00:17:26,390
- Ice cubes in cups.
- Coke?

557
00:17:26,390 --> 00:17:28,120
Packed meals, triangular gimbap,
ramyeon...

558
00:17:28,250 --> 00:17:30,450
- Triangular gimbap, definitely.
- Definitely.

559
00:17:30,450 --> 00:17:32,250
You can only get it
at convenience stores.

560
00:17:32,250 --> 00:17:33,750
I'm sure it's in the ranking.

561
00:17:33,750 --> 00:17:36,420
You could even say,
without triangular gimbap,

562
00:17:36,420 --> 00:17:39,070
convenience stores wouldn't be
where they are now.

563
00:17:39,070 --> 00:17:41,230
Convenience stores were
made by companies.

564
00:17:41,230 --> 00:17:42,300
(Jong Kook disagrees.)

565
00:17:42,300 --> 00:17:44,000
- What's with you today?
- Hey!

566
00:17:45,930 --> 00:17:48,080
There's an item I'm thinking of,
but I'm not going to tell you.

567
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:49,550
- Tell us. Come on.
- What is it?

568
00:17:49,610 --> 00:17:51,810
- I'm sure it's near the top.
- Tell us.

569
00:17:51,810 --> 00:17:54,080
- Sausages.
- Sausages?

570
00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:55,910
- Sausages...
- That's just what you like.

571
00:17:55,910 --> 00:17:57,090
They sell more than you think.

572
00:17:57,090 --> 00:17:59,050
I think hangover drinks
sell a lot too.

573
00:17:59,050 --> 00:18:00,820
- Gosh.
- Hangover drinks. That's right.

574
00:18:00,910 --> 00:18:02,560
That's the only place
where hangover drinks are sold.

575
00:18:02,560 --> 00:18:03,680
Yes, you can only buy them
at convenience stores.

576
00:18:03,680 --> 00:18:05,980
- You're right.
- That's what I also said.

577
00:18:05,980 --> 00:18:08,360
Hangover drinks.
Ji Hyo knows it well.

578
00:18:08,360 --> 00:18:10,600
Everyone's just pointing out
what they mostly buy.

579
00:18:11,190 --> 00:18:13,460
- Sausages, fish cake bars...
- Ramyeon...

580
00:18:13,460 --> 00:18:14,460
Suk Jin, what do you think?

581
00:18:14,460 --> 00:18:15,990
Isn't he more used
to union sales shops?

582
00:18:15,990 --> 00:18:17,840
(Isn't he more used
to union sales shops?)

583
00:18:17,930 --> 00:18:19,430
(People his age would be
more familiar with that.)

584
00:18:19,430 --> 00:18:20,970
Is that the actual name?

585
00:18:21,110 --> 00:18:22,940
I bet you called for barmaids.

586
00:18:23,470 --> 00:18:24,850
(Should I play along with this?)

587
00:18:24,850 --> 00:18:26,440
- Barmaid!
- I'd order rice and soup...

588
00:18:26,440 --> 00:18:28,650
before climbing the mountain range.

589
00:18:28,650 --> 00:18:30,480
How long would
your straw shoes last?

590
00:18:30,980 --> 00:18:33,210
They'd wear out
after walking up two hills.

591
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:34,510
(I can't believe
he's playing along with this.)

592
00:18:34,510 --> 00:18:37,660
Instead of coins or actual money,
we paid with shells.

593
00:18:37,660 --> 00:18:39,180
- Really?
- With shells?

594
00:18:39,180 --> 00:18:41,950
- Didn't you have currency?
- No, it was before that.

595
00:18:41,950 --> 00:18:44,660
- He's playing along.
- Clamshells?

596
00:18:44,690 --> 00:18:46,370
Have you seen
a royal insignia before?

597
00:18:46,660 --> 00:18:48,230
(Will he play along with this too?)

598
00:18:48,230 --> 00:18:50,310
Didn't I tell you about this?

599
00:18:50,310 --> 00:18:52,540
A good friend of mine from school
became a secret inspector.

600
00:18:53,110 --> 00:18:55,080
- A friend from school?
- Yes.

601
00:18:55,080 --> 00:18:57,700
I felt betrayed because
we'd play together all the time.

602
00:18:57,700 --> 00:18:58,770
But he still managed to study hard.

603
00:18:58,770 --> 00:19:00,740
- He studied at night.
- Without you knowing?

604
00:19:00,740 --> 00:19:02,170
He studied hard behind my back.

605
00:19:02,790 --> 00:19:04,740
- Unbelievable.
- That's insane.

606
00:19:04,740 --> 00:19:08,180
Anyway, I was surprised to see
how he turned out.

607
00:19:09,010 --> 00:19:10,920
Did Shim Chung exist in real life?

608
00:19:10,920 --> 00:19:13,600
- What about Chun Hyang?
- Did you ever get to see her?

609
00:19:13,720 --> 00:19:16,630
Chun Hyang? Well, I had
only heard rumors about her.

610
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:19,100
What about Shim Chung?

611
00:19:19,330 --> 00:19:21,840
- What about Shim Chung?
- That inspector is my friend.

612
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:23,040
- Really?
- What?

613
00:19:23,040 --> 00:19:25,070
- No way.
- Are you kidding me?

614
00:19:25,070 --> 00:19:26,770
- He's my friend.
- The puzzle pieces come together.

615
00:19:26,770 --> 00:19:28,140
Exactly.

616
00:19:28,140 --> 00:19:29,850
What does the poison taste like?

617
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,110
- What?
- The poison.

618
00:19:31,110 --> 00:19:32,500
I didn't die by drinking it.

619
00:19:32,700 --> 00:19:34,050
He said he never died.

620
00:19:34,050 --> 00:19:35,620
Didn't you once drink it
until you were full?

621
00:19:35,620 --> 00:19:37,090
(Ji Suk Jin, the immortal)

622
00:19:37,090 --> 00:19:39,390
I heard that you ate rice
with your poison.

623
00:19:40,410 --> 00:19:41,410
No way.

624
00:19:41,410 --> 00:19:43,750
Suk Jin will be
exhausted after this.

625
00:19:43,830 --> 00:19:45,720
You're draining his energy.

626
00:19:45,720 --> 00:19:48,060
Suk Jin, you won't
have enough energy for later.

627
00:19:48,060 --> 00:19:50,160
As you know, back then,

628
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:52,300
we weren't able
to meet with women freely.

629
00:19:52,300 --> 00:19:54,430
- But I saw Chun Hyang.
- How was she?

630
00:19:54,430 --> 00:19:56,610
- Was she pretty?
- She didn't have double eyelids.

631
00:19:56,610 --> 00:19:59,730
Magistrate Byun? He was pure evil,
so don't get me started on him.

632
00:20:00,170 --> 00:20:02,000
- There weren't photos back then.
- Exactly.

633
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,410
- Someone drew a picture.
- A drawing.

634
00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:06,380
- How can it be trusted though?
- I know.

635
00:20:06,380 --> 00:20:10,940
- Can this be aired?
- No way.

636
00:20:11,650 --> 00:20:14,160
It sounds too fake
to even be a joke.

637
00:20:14,390 --> 00:20:15,910
Jae Suk drew an X.

638
00:20:15,980 --> 00:20:17,450
- It'll never air.
- But it sounds true...

639
00:20:17,450 --> 00:20:18,920
coming from him.

640
00:20:18,920 --> 00:20:21,990
We all pitched in at first,
but we sneaked out one by one.

641
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:24,400
It became boring
once Suk Jin found it funny.

642
00:20:25,960 --> 00:20:27,660
Jae Suk's analysis is funnier.

643
00:20:27,660 --> 00:20:30,110
Jong Kook's jokes
shouldn't be returned so easily.

644
00:20:30,230 --> 00:20:32,730
It lost its appeal
because Suk Jin found it funny.

645
00:20:32,730 --> 00:20:33,770
He played along too easily.

646
00:20:33,770 --> 00:20:36,650
Jong Kook kept going
to see who would give in first.

647
00:20:37,610 --> 00:20:39,650
I heard that Magistrate Byun
was quite handsome though.

648
00:20:39,650 --> 00:20:41,620
- You have no idea.
- Really?

649
00:20:42,010 --> 00:20:43,050
(Wasn't it over?)

650
00:20:43,050 --> 00:20:45,710
He could even be better looking
than Chang Wook.

651
00:20:45,710 --> 00:20:48,090
- Better looking than Chang Wook?
- Yes.

652
00:20:48,090 --> 00:20:50,160
- I feel bad for you now.
- Can you please stop?

653
00:20:50,160 --> 00:20:51,980
- This isn't a pretty sight.
- Please stop.

654
00:20:51,980 --> 00:20:53,800
- Jong Kook, please stop.
- But it's funny.

655
00:20:54,300 --> 00:20:55,920
- It's funny though.
- Jong Kook...

656
00:20:55,920 --> 00:20:57,960
- Did you hear him or not?
- You're exhausting him.

657
00:20:57,960 --> 00:20:59,960
He's only doing this
to entertain you, Jong Kook.

658
00:20:59,960 --> 00:21:01,660
- But Suk Jin...
- This...

659
00:21:01,660 --> 00:21:04,070
- I was bored.
- He kept going for you.

660
00:21:04,260 --> 00:21:05,840
Gosh, what is this?

661
00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:08,410
What's this for?
Are we doing something in secret?

662
00:21:08,410 --> 00:21:09,650
- Also...
- Yoo Jung, you can sit here.

663
00:21:09,650 --> 00:21:11,150
There must be some sort of mission.

664
00:21:11,150 --> 00:21:12,380
There must be.

665
00:21:12,850 --> 00:21:14,210
- It's a convenience store.
- What?

666
00:21:14,650 --> 00:21:15,970
Is this security camera footage?

667
00:21:16,620 --> 00:21:19,390
(What kind of game will they play
at the convenience store?)

668
00:21:19,390 --> 00:21:22,250
The first game is called
Sweet Combinations.

669
00:21:22,250 --> 00:21:23,590
- Sweet Combinations?
- Right.

670
00:21:23,750 --> 00:21:25,520
Each team will go in turns.

671
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:28,800
You are to successfully
make and bring back...

672
00:21:28,900 --> 00:21:31,960
the three customized items
that have been pre-ordered.

673
00:21:31,960 --> 00:21:33,230
We must make them?

674
00:21:33,230 --> 00:21:35,460
Four members of the staff
already placed their orders...

675
00:21:35,460 --> 00:21:36,540
to us.

676
00:21:36,540 --> 00:21:38,200
One other team...

677
00:21:38,200 --> 00:21:40,770
will enter blindfolded
but with a toy hammer.

678
00:21:41,580 --> 00:21:44,650
If you get hit by the hammer,
you will be out.

679
00:21:44,650 --> 00:21:45,700
- No way!
- We'll be driven out.

680
00:21:45,700 --> 00:21:48,320
The ones remaining
must make the dishes themselves.

681
00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:50,050
- We shouldn't make noise.
- So you must stay quiet...

682
00:21:50,050 --> 00:21:51,790
and make the dishes fast.

683
00:21:52,010 --> 00:21:53,560
You will go in turns.

684
00:21:53,560 --> 00:21:55,860
The team with the fastest record...

685
00:21:55,860 --> 00:21:58,060
- will win the game.
- Got it.

686
00:21:58,180 --> 00:22:01,160
The teams will now
choose a member of the staff.

687
00:22:01,720 --> 00:22:03,130
Please show it to the camera.

688
00:22:03,260 --> 00:22:04,960
1, 2, 3, and 4.

689
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:06,730
Did Sunhwa choose number three?
Good.

690
00:22:06,730 --> 00:22:08,570
When Team One enters,

691
00:22:08,570 --> 00:22:10,140
Team Two will follow
with toy hammers.

692
00:22:10,140 --> 00:22:12,230
- Jong Kook's coming for us.
- We'll go after Team Four.

693
00:22:12,230 --> 00:22:13,470
- Gosh.
- It's his team?

694
00:22:13,930 --> 00:22:15,080
- Are you Team Two?
- It'll be doomsday.

695
00:22:15,080 --> 00:22:17,110
All right. Team Two will enter...

696
00:22:17,110 --> 00:22:19,000
- and get ready with the hammers.
- Unbelievable.

697
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:20,080
Yoo Jung...

698
00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:21,970
Jong Kook will be a tough opponent.

699
00:22:21,970 --> 00:22:23,890
He'll use his strength to stop us.

700
00:22:23,890 --> 00:22:25,440
Then go ahead and hit him.

701
00:22:26,120 --> 00:22:27,560
We need to take these.

702
00:22:27,560 --> 00:22:29,210
They'll be making the dishes
on a table.

703
00:22:29,210 --> 00:22:31,330
- Right?
- How can we possibly miss?

704
00:22:31,330 --> 00:22:32,590
Will we have to wear blindfolds?

705
00:22:32,590 --> 00:22:33,660
Of course.

706
00:22:33,660 --> 00:22:35,660
Right? We must be blindfolded.

707
00:22:35,830 --> 00:22:37,190
Isn't that obvious?

708
00:22:37,190 --> 00:22:38,690
I knew it wouldn't be that easy.

709
00:22:38,690 --> 00:22:40,160
Why would you even ask that?

710
00:22:40,490 --> 00:22:43,570
The microwave is over there,
so that's where they'll go.

711
00:22:43,570 --> 00:22:44,570
Right?

712
00:22:44,570 --> 00:22:46,470
(Microwave 2, Drinks, Microwave 3)

713
00:22:46,470 --> 00:22:48,230
(Snacks, Ramyeon, Gimbap and Drinks,
Microwave 1, Counter)

714
00:22:48,430 --> 00:22:50,080
They'll have to come over here.

715
00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:52,200
This is where
the ramyeon and other things are.

716
00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:53,940
- We should... Yoo Jung!
- Yes?

717
00:22:53,940 --> 00:22:56,390
We'll each take an aisle.

718
00:22:56,390 --> 00:22:57,740
We're responsible for one lane each.

719
00:22:57,740 --> 00:22:59,440
One each? I'll take this one.

720
00:23:00,160 --> 00:23:02,560
Someone from Team One
will step forward...

721
00:23:02,560 --> 00:23:04,220
and pick a staff member.

722
00:23:04,220 --> 00:23:06,020
- Team 1, go ahead.
- Team 1?

723
00:23:06,020 --> 00:23:07,160
- Let me see.
- Sure.

724
00:23:07,160 --> 00:23:08,360
(The orders made
by the members of the staff)

725
00:23:08,360 --> 00:23:09,830
Go Ji Yeon, the youngest director.

726
00:23:09,830 --> 00:23:11,400
Kang Chae Ra, the floor director.

727
00:23:11,400 --> 00:23:12,760
Kang Chan Hee,
the director of photography.

728
00:23:12,760 --> 00:23:14,300
I choose Mr. Kang Chan Hee.

729
00:23:14,300 --> 00:23:15,730
I doubt he knows...

730
00:23:15,730 --> 00:23:18,070
a lot about what you can make
in convenience stores.

731
00:23:18,070 --> 00:23:20,430
- He wouldn't mix things.
- It won't be too complicated.

732
00:23:20,430 --> 00:23:22,970
- I'm not sure about this.
- He'd keep it simple.

733
00:23:22,970 --> 00:23:24,240
- Are you sure?
- There's a lot written down.

734
00:23:24,910 --> 00:23:27,210
"Heat in the microwave
for 30 seconds..."

735
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:30,290
- What's the menu?
- Let me read these to you.

736
00:23:30,290 --> 00:23:31,510
A peeled triangular gimbap...

737
00:23:31,510 --> 00:23:33,290
that's been heated up in
the microwave for 30 seconds.

738
00:23:33,290 --> 00:23:35,980
A cup of grain latte made from
a grain snack and grain milk.

739
00:23:36,450 --> 00:23:39,660
A sandwich made from
a cheese bun and potato salad.

740
00:23:40,060 --> 00:23:41,130
(He can't believe his ears.)

741
00:23:41,130 --> 00:23:42,130
But...

742
00:23:42,130 --> 00:23:44,020
You're quite picky, Mr. Kang.

743
00:23:44,020 --> 00:23:46,490
- That's what you enjoy?
- Those aren't easy to make.

744
00:23:46,660 --> 00:23:48,930
I had no idea
that he enjoyed grain latte.

745
00:23:48,930 --> 00:23:50,570
I like his recipes though.

746
00:23:50,570 --> 00:23:52,040
The grain snack
would be delicious though.

747
00:23:52,040 --> 00:23:53,310
I'd like to try them.

748
00:23:53,310 --> 00:23:55,080
- Did you have to pick number one?
- Sang Woo...

749
00:23:55,700 --> 00:23:56,770
No, you did great.

750
00:24:01,170 --> 00:24:03,290
- They're here!
- Are they here?

751
00:24:03,480 --> 00:24:04,480
They're here!

752
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:06,090
(The soldiers are ready
with their toy hammers.)

753
00:24:06,090 --> 00:24:07,160
They haven't entered yet.

754
00:24:07,820 --> 00:24:09,010
Actually, I have no idea.

755
00:24:09,620 --> 00:24:10,830
- What do we do?
- Actually, I have no idea.

756
00:24:11,660 --> 00:24:13,860
Make sure you don't hit the stands.

757
00:24:14,900 --> 00:24:16,990
They could be in here already.

758
00:24:19,300 --> 00:24:21,400
(Team Sang Woo enters covertly.)

759
00:24:21,400 --> 00:24:23,140
- Are they inside?
- Are they in here?

760
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:25,660
- Can't you tell us? Who's there?
- What is it?

761
00:24:25,660 --> 00:24:26,730
Oh, it's nothing.

762
00:24:26,730 --> 00:24:29,000
They don't know
that Team Sang Woo entered.

763
00:24:30,440 --> 00:24:31,440
(Thump!)

764
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:33,650
- Is someone there?
- No, I hit something else.

765
00:24:34,210 --> 00:24:36,320
(While Team Yoo Jung
wanders around...)

766
00:24:36,850 --> 00:24:38,940
(They spot a triangular gimbap.)

767
00:24:38,940 --> 00:24:41,090
- Is someone there?
- No, it's just the stand.

768
00:24:41,560 --> 00:24:42,620
I'm...

769
00:24:42,790 --> 00:24:44,720
(They pick up a triangular gimbap.)

770
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:46,450
- But...
- I'm checking the back too.

771
00:24:46,450 --> 00:24:48,220
The microwave is over there.

772
00:24:48,830 --> 00:24:50,870
They won't even let us know
if they've entered.

773
00:24:51,800 --> 00:24:54,190
(Suk Jin is standing guard.)

774
00:24:54,190 --> 00:24:55,230
Who's this?

775
00:24:55,230 --> 00:24:56,870
- Are they not...
- Who's this?

776
00:24:56,870 --> 00:24:58,610
- Aren't they inside yet?
- They're over there.

777
00:25:00,380 --> 00:25:02,310
- Team Sang Woo is already inside.
- Already?

778
00:25:02,310 --> 00:25:03,310
Really?

779
00:25:03,310 --> 00:25:04,610
(Suk Jin's right
next to Jong Kook.)

780
00:25:04,610 --> 00:25:07,210
(But Jong Kook has nowhere to go.)

781
00:25:07,210 --> 00:25:09,850
(Jong Kook tries to slide past him.)

782
00:25:10,890 --> 00:25:11,980
We need to locate them.

783
00:25:11,980 --> 00:25:14,320
(Jong Kook gets past Suk Jin
undetected.)

784
00:25:14,320 --> 00:25:15,820
I can't see a thing.

785
00:25:15,820 --> 00:25:17,250
- Where are they?
- It's not easy.

786
00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:20,100
We should keep in mind
that they don't make any noise.

787
00:25:20,520 --> 00:25:21,600
Help me.

788
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:23,160
Did you hit someone or not?

789
00:25:23,330 --> 00:25:24,760
(Jong Kook squeezes through.)

790
00:25:24,760 --> 00:25:26,020
There's someone here!

791
00:25:27,460 --> 00:25:28,540
There's someone here!

792
00:25:28,540 --> 00:25:30,810
(The old man waves
around his hammer.)

793
00:25:30,810 --> 00:25:32,110
I sense someone.

794
00:25:32,110 --> 00:25:33,140
Where?

795
00:25:33,140 --> 00:25:34,170
Over here.

796
00:25:34,170 --> 00:25:36,170
Where? Someone ran past me.

797
00:25:36,170 --> 00:25:37,350
(Sang Woo, distract him for me.)

798
00:25:37,580 --> 00:25:39,740
- Hold on.
- Someone threw something.

799
00:25:40,170 --> 00:25:42,440
Someone's here!

800
00:25:42,440 --> 00:25:44,290
- Where?
- Where?

801
00:25:44,290 --> 00:25:46,860
- I heard something.
- Where?

802
00:25:46,860 --> 00:25:48,980
(So Min and Sang Woo
have nowhere to go.)

803
00:25:48,980 --> 00:25:51,180
- Where?
- Charge!

804
00:25:51,180 --> 00:25:52,220
Where?

805
00:25:52,220 --> 00:25:53,300
(So Min quickly
makes an escape too.)

806
00:25:53,300 --> 00:25:54,330
Where are they?

807
00:25:54,330 --> 00:25:55,860
I heard them over here but...

808
00:25:55,860 --> 00:25:58,160
I can't tell where they are.

809
00:25:58,400 --> 00:25:59,660
(Beeping)

810
00:25:59,660 --> 00:26:01,100
- The microwave!
- The microwave!

811
00:26:01,800 --> 00:26:03,700
(Busted!)

812
00:26:04,070 --> 00:26:06,540
(Jong Kook is surrounded
by Yoo Jung and Suk Jin.)

813
00:26:07,470 --> 00:26:09,080
- Where are they?
- By the microwave.

814
00:26:09,430 --> 00:26:11,440
(He sees an opening
and manages to escape.)

815
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:14,080
- Where are they?
- I heard someone over here.

816
00:26:14,080 --> 00:26:15,380
- Is there another microwave here?
- Where?

817
00:26:15,380 --> 00:26:16,620
- Where are they?
- By the microwave.

818
00:26:16,620 --> 00:26:17,710
- Where?
- Over here.

819
00:26:17,710 --> 00:26:20,320
- Gosh, it's just me.
- Where?

820
00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:22,120
- Where are they?
- I'm sorry.

821
00:26:22,120 --> 00:26:23,660
- Someone's here.
- Hold on a second.

822
00:26:23,660 --> 00:26:24,790
- Here.
- I heard the microwave beep.

823
00:26:24,790 --> 00:26:26,920
- Who is this?
- Who am I hitting?

824
00:26:26,920 --> 00:26:28,450
- It's me.
- Yoo Jung, is this you?

825
00:26:28,450 --> 00:26:29,560
- It's me.
- Who's this?

826
00:26:29,560 --> 00:26:31,300
- It's me you're hitting.
- I found someone.

827
00:26:31,300 --> 00:26:32,690
- Where?
- Who is this?

828
00:26:33,300 --> 00:26:35,100
- Who are you?
- I'm the cameraman.

829
00:26:35,100 --> 00:26:36,140
- The cameraman?
- I'm sorry.

830
00:26:36,430 --> 00:26:37,640
Are you sure?

831
00:26:39,540 --> 00:26:42,000
Someone should stay behind there.
Don't stay here.

832
00:26:42,310 --> 00:26:45,200
(Jong Kook heads to
another microwave.)

833
00:26:45,550 --> 00:26:46,580
(Beeping)

834
00:26:46,580 --> 00:26:49,770
I heard something!

835
00:26:49,770 --> 00:26:51,550
- Right?
- There are two microwaves.

836
00:26:51,550 --> 00:26:52,820
- There are two microwaves?
- There's one up front.

837
00:26:52,820 --> 00:26:54,750
Wasn't it the microwave
beeping just now?

838
00:26:54,750 --> 00:26:56,660
- There's one up front?
- Really?

839
00:26:56,660 --> 00:26:57,680
Hold on a second.

840
00:26:57,680 --> 00:26:58,790
I heard something.

841
00:26:58,790 --> 00:27:01,300
- What's this?
- It came from the left.

842
00:27:01,690 --> 00:27:02,750
Over there.

843
00:27:02,950 --> 00:27:03,990
I heard it again!

844
00:27:05,020 --> 00:27:07,490
(The moment the microwave beeps,)

845
00:27:07,490 --> 00:27:09,910
(Jong Kook comes flying forward.)

846
00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:11,730
Over there.

847
00:27:11,730 --> 00:27:13,470
I heard it again!
It's the microwave.

848
00:27:13,470 --> 00:27:14,470
- Where?
- The timer's up.

849
00:27:14,470 --> 00:27:15,700
(Jong Kook's surrounded though.)

850
00:27:15,700 --> 00:27:17,610
The timer's up.

851
00:27:17,610 --> 00:27:18,650
(He makes a run for it
through the small opening.)

852
00:27:18,970 --> 00:27:20,850
- Where?
- The microwave is done.

853
00:27:20,940 --> 00:27:22,650
I definitely heard something.

854
00:27:22,650 --> 00:27:23,910
It came from the left.

855
00:27:24,150 --> 00:27:26,790
- It came from across the store.
- I can smell the food now.

856
00:27:27,290 --> 00:27:28,820
- Suk Jin, stay there.
- Okay.

857
00:27:28,820 --> 00:27:29,820
(They only have to leave
the store now.)

858
00:27:29,820 --> 00:27:30,830
Hold on.

859
00:27:31,390 --> 00:27:35,490
(Will Team Sang Woo be able
to safely exit the store?)

860
00:27:35,490 --> 00:27:37,420
(Sang Woo makes it out first.)

861
00:27:37,420 --> 00:27:39,830
(Jong Kook also
makes it out safely!)

862
00:27:41,260 --> 00:27:43,430
The dishes will
be evaluated outside.

863
00:27:43,430 --> 00:27:45,140
Hold on. Someone just poked me.

864
00:27:45,140 --> 00:27:46,200
Really?

865
00:27:47,310 --> 00:27:48,340
- Here...
- Unbelievable.

866
00:27:48,410 --> 00:27:49,910
- I hit someone.
- You did?

867
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:51,000
Yes, I just did.

868
00:27:51,550 --> 00:27:52,740
Didn't I hit anyone?

869
00:27:53,240 --> 00:27:54,850
Are they done already?

870
00:27:56,010 --> 00:27:58,440
- I had a blast.
- Did you make all the dishes?

871
00:27:58,590 --> 00:28:00,480
You have to go back in
if you didn't follow the recipe.

872
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:02,510
- Really?
- Sang Woo,

873
00:28:02,510 --> 00:28:04,360
- what kind of milk did you use?
- Good job, So Min.

874
00:28:04,360 --> 00:28:05,390
It was...

875
00:28:05,890 --> 00:28:07,800
normal white milk.

876
00:28:08,020 --> 00:28:09,720
You got the menu wrong,
so you have to make it again.

877
00:28:09,720 --> 00:28:11,330
- Again?
- You have to make grain latte.

878
00:28:11,330 --> 00:28:12,520
Grain latte?

879
00:28:12,520 --> 00:28:14,800
- What's this?
- Is that grain milk?

880
00:28:14,800 --> 00:28:16,570
- What's that?
- Grain...

881
00:28:16,570 --> 00:28:19,140
Quick, Sang Woo. You messed up.

882
00:28:19,760 --> 00:28:22,110
(He checks the recipe
one more time.)

883
00:28:22,340 --> 00:28:23,810
I don't hear anything.

884
00:28:23,810 --> 00:28:25,880
Did they take their shoes off?

885
00:28:25,880 --> 00:28:27,440
I don't think they left yet.

886
00:28:28,050 --> 00:28:29,380
They're still inside.

887
00:28:29,380 --> 00:28:30,390
(Zombie Yu has
neither reflex nor wits.)

888
00:28:31,050 --> 00:28:32,910
(He gets the ingredients again.)

889
00:28:34,090 --> 00:28:36,120
(While Sang Woo picks out
the ingredients...)

890
00:28:36,120 --> 00:28:37,130
(Hitting)

891
00:28:37,920 --> 00:28:39,330
(So Min tries to confuse him.)

892
00:28:39,330 --> 00:28:40,520
What are they doing?

893
00:28:40,660 --> 00:28:41,860
Somebody just hit me.

894
00:28:44,070 --> 00:28:45,920
(Sang Woo throws a trap as well.)

895
00:28:45,920 --> 00:28:47,400
(Screaming)

896
00:28:47,400 --> 00:28:48,400
(He strikes Suk Jin's belly.)

897
00:28:48,400 --> 00:28:49,400
Hey!

898
00:28:49,930 --> 00:28:52,730
(The toy hammer got his sides.)

899
00:28:53,470 --> 00:28:55,610
(They find the blunder hilarious.)

900
00:28:56,110 --> 00:28:58,550
Who makes that sound
after getting hit by a toy hammer?

901
00:28:58,550 --> 00:28:59,610
It made full contact.

902
00:28:59,770 --> 00:29:01,210
I hear footsteps. Footsteps!

903
00:29:01,820 --> 00:29:03,510
(What's he doing by himself?)

904
00:29:03,910 --> 00:29:05,120
I hear footsteps. That way!

905
00:29:05,240 --> 00:29:06,290
Where?

906
00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:07,660
Ahead of me.

907
00:29:08,010 --> 00:29:10,720
(They just have to get out
to complete all items on the menu.)

908
00:29:11,450 --> 00:29:12,950
Where are they?

909
00:29:12,950 --> 00:29:14,450
(This is a bait.)

910
00:29:15,900 --> 00:29:17,420
Hey.

911
00:29:19,370 --> 00:29:20,990
- It's me.
- Is it you?

912
00:29:20,990 --> 00:29:23,070
(Team Sang Woo completes all items.)

913
00:29:23,260 --> 00:29:25,070
How many times did you hit me?

914
00:29:25,840 --> 00:29:27,930
- This fell off.
- The mission is over.

915
00:29:28,430 --> 00:29:29,970
- Suk Jin.
- Jae Suk keeps on hitting me.

916
00:29:29,970 --> 00:29:31,700
We thought you were going to die.

917
00:29:31,700 --> 00:29:33,270
- Why?
- They keep fighting.

918
00:29:33,270 --> 00:29:34,620
Jae Suk hit you too many times.

919
00:29:34,620 --> 00:29:36,240
Why did you hit me so many times?

920
00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:37,710
You made weird sounds.

921
00:29:38,120 --> 00:29:39,550
I stood next to you
for the longest time.

922
00:29:39,550 --> 00:29:41,410
- How?
- Right in front of you.

923
00:29:41,410 --> 00:29:44,090
You were like zombies
in front of the microwave.

924
00:29:44,090 --> 00:29:46,250
I turned on the microwave,
and you were all there.

925
00:29:46,250 --> 00:29:47,630
There were two microwaves.

926
00:29:47,630 --> 00:29:49,300
Gosh, the microwave.

927
00:29:49,300 --> 00:29:51,630
You were like zombies.

928
00:29:52,190 --> 00:29:54,660
It's our turn next.
We should do well.

929
00:29:54,840 --> 00:29:56,430
Try Go Ji Yeon,
the youngest director.

930
00:29:56,840 --> 00:29:57,840
You have to microwave it
for a long time.

931
00:29:57,840 --> 00:29:59,570
Please get back.

932
00:29:59,570 --> 00:30:00,970
(Tteokbokki microwaved for 1 minute,
cocktail with plain yogurt...)

933
00:30:00,970 --> 00:30:02,430
- This is better.
- What?

934
00:30:02,430 --> 00:30:04,240
(and orange juice,
ice cream with chocolate snack)

935
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:06,500
Let's turn off the microwave.

936
00:30:06,500 --> 00:30:07,880
- When they come.
- Jae Suk.

937
00:30:07,880 --> 00:30:09,880
Look. It's this button.

938
00:30:09,880 --> 00:30:13,480
Increase the time or turn it off.

939
00:30:13,510 --> 00:30:15,290
How did they do it so perfectly?

940
00:30:15,290 --> 00:30:16,360
Which team is inside?

941
00:30:18,390 --> 00:30:20,060
I think Jae Suk is good
at this game.

942
00:30:20,800 --> 00:30:21,830
Are they inside?

943
00:30:22,900 --> 00:30:24,630
- They're inside.
- They're inside!

944
00:30:24,630 --> 00:30:26,100
(She's nervous.)

945
00:30:26,370 --> 00:30:27,900
- Go. Go around.
- Are they inside?

946
00:30:28,900 --> 00:30:30,640
(She patiently picks out
the ingredients.)

947
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:32,000
- Are they inside?
- Go around.

948
00:30:32,570 --> 00:30:36,810
(Tteokbokki microwaved for 1 minute)

949
00:30:37,810 --> 00:30:38,810
I'm off.

950
00:30:38,810 --> 00:30:40,000
(She gets tteokbokki and backs off.)

951
00:30:41,550 --> 00:30:43,820
(He's on full alert.)

952
00:30:45,320 --> 00:30:46,910
I hear footsteps.

953
00:30:46,910 --> 00:30:48,010
(Ice cream with chocolate snack)

954
00:30:48,010 --> 00:30:49,980
- They're inside, right?
- I think so.

955
00:30:49,980 --> 00:30:51,290
(Yoo Jung makes tteokbokki
in the corner.)

956
00:30:51,830 --> 00:30:52,980
They're inside. It's this way.

957
00:30:52,980 --> 00:30:53,990
Where?

958
00:30:53,990 --> 00:30:55,750
(While Haha turns away,)

959
00:30:55,750 --> 00:30:57,190
(he gets the ice cream cone.)

960
00:30:57,190 --> 00:30:58,220
I heard them.

961
00:30:58,220 --> 00:30:59,460
(He strikes with his toy hammer.)

962
00:31:00,070 --> 00:31:01,990
(That was close.)

963
00:31:01,990 --> 00:31:04,000
I don't think
they're coming this way.

964
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:06,230
- Over there.
- I heard them.

965
00:31:06,230 --> 00:31:07,230
(I heard them.)

966
00:31:07,230 --> 00:31:08,700
It's this way. I heard them.

967
00:31:08,700 --> 00:31:09,970
- Where are you?
- Where?

968
00:31:11,410 --> 00:31:13,150
(Inching slowly)

969
00:31:13,710 --> 00:31:14,910
- Who's this?
- It's me.

970
00:31:14,910 --> 00:31:16,120
Welcome.

971
00:31:16,470 --> 00:31:17,890
(What are you doing over there?)

972
00:31:18,510 --> 00:31:19,550
I think somebody is over here.

973
00:31:19,550 --> 00:31:21,620
- Come this way. It's me.
- Where are you?

974
00:31:21,620 --> 00:31:23,560
- Corner them!
- Left side.

975
00:31:23,560 --> 00:31:25,290
- Did you touch them?
- Didn't I hit them?

976
00:31:25,920 --> 00:31:26,990
Didn't I?

977
00:31:27,520 --> 00:31:29,560
- It's me.
- I can't see anything.

978
00:31:30,220 --> 00:31:31,260
What was that?

979
00:31:31,420 --> 00:31:32,420
They're nowhere.

980
00:31:32,660 --> 00:31:34,300
(Sniffing)

981
00:31:34,300 --> 00:31:36,840
(He follows the smell
and reaches the microwave.)

982
00:31:37,840 --> 00:31:38,840
What's this?

983
00:31:39,730 --> 00:31:40,970
Somebody microwaved food.

984
00:31:41,340 --> 00:31:42,380
They did?

985
00:31:42,380 --> 00:31:44,610
It smells sweet. What's this?

986
00:31:44,700 --> 00:31:45,850
I think it's triangular gimbap.

987
00:31:47,120 --> 00:31:49,710
(It's the triangular gimbap
Jong Kook failed to remove.)

988
00:31:50,320 --> 00:31:51,410
I'll put it in my pocket.

989
00:31:51,410 --> 00:31:52,890
Se Chan.

990
00:31:52,890 --> 00:31:54,160
(He keeps the inheritance
Jong Kook left.)

991
00:31:54,160 --> 00:31:55,250
- Se Chan.
- Yes?

992
00:31:55,250 --> 00:31:57,330
- Did they microwave something?
- They did but couldn't take it.

993
00:31:57,330 --> 00:31:58,520
Really? Take it out.

994
00:31:58,520 --> 00:32:00,520
- I did. It's in my pocket.
- Is it?

995
00:32:00,520 --> 00:32:02,220
(Ice cream with chocolate snack)

996
00:32:02,220 --> 00:32:03,400
I found it.

997
00:32:04,570 --> 00:32:06,020
- I heard a sound.
- Here.

998
00:32:06,800 --> 00:32:07,900
- Se Chan.
- Did you get them?

999
00:32:08,430 --> 00:32:11,000
I opened the microwave,
and I smelled ramyeon.

1000
00:32:11,540 --> 00:32:13,540
(Suk Jin and Yoo Jung get away.)

1001
00:32:15,930 --> 00:32:18,500
(Jae Suk gets cornered!)

1002
00:32:19,910 --> 00:32:20,970
I heard a sound.

1003
00:32:20,970 --> 00:32:22,620
(He uses his sense of touch
and hearing.)

1004
00:32:22,970 --> 00:32:25,240
It's over here. This way.

1005
00:32:25,240 --> 00:32:26,890
(He's a psychic
who uses his five senses.)

1006
00:32:26,890 --> 00:32:28,410
I don't know where they are.

1007
00:32:28,410 --> 00:32:29,660
- I hear a sound.
- Haha.

1008
00:32:29,790 --> 00:32:31,420
Come this way.

1009
00:32:31,630 --> 00:32:33,220
(He covers his mouth.)

1010
00:32:33,220 --> 00:32:34,900
(The situation is
about to escalate.)

1011
00:32:35,450 --> 00:32:37,260
- Who are you?
- No one's here.

1012
00:32:37,260 --> 00:32:39,920
Hey, Jong Kook!

1013
00:32:39,920 --> 00:32:41,370
(Is this the cameraman?)

1014
00:32:41,370 --> 00:32:44,430
Haha, does the cameraman
have a microphone?

1015
00:32:44,840 --> 00:32:46,370
Hey!

1016
00:32:46,370 --> 00:32:47,430
(I caught you, rascal!)

1017
00:32:48,310 --> 00:32:49,910
Who are you?

1018
00:32:49,910 --> 00:32:51,310
- Did you get somebody?
- Jae Suk is out.

1019
00:32:51,310 --> 00:32:52,970
- It was Jae Suk.
- Good job.

1020
00:32:52,970 --> 00:32:54,210
Who did it? Good job.

1021
00:32:54,210 --> 00:32:55,510
- My gosh.
- Haha.

1022
00:32:55,510 --> 00:32:56,710
Please return everything.

1023
00:32:56,710 --> 00:32:58,650
I smelled him.

1024
00:32:59,180 --> 00:33:00,820
He smells so good.

1025
00:33:00,820 --> 00:33:01,910
Wait.

1026
00:33:01,910 --> 00:33:03,290
He smells so good.

1027
00:33:03,510 --> 00:33:05,160
Oh, my gosh.

1028
00:33:05,160 --> 00:33:06,390
(He exits
without getting anything done.)

1029
00:33:07,600 --> 00:33:09,400
- They're coming this way.
- It's me.

1030
00:33:09,750 --> 00:33:11,260
Hey.

1031
00:33:11,260 --> 00:33:12,330
- Yoo Jung is out.
- Yes!

1032
00:33:13,400 --> 00:33:14,660
Suk Jin is out.

1033
00:33:14,660 --> 00:33:16,460
- Is Suk Jin out?
- Is he out?

1034
00:33:16,460 --> 00:33:17,730
How am I out?

1035
00:33:18,410 --> 00:33:20,840
(While Se Chan was
going after Yoo Jung,)

1036
00:33:20,840 --> 00:33:22,610
(he gently touched Suk Jin.)

1037
00:33:22,970 --> 00:33:24,200
- Is everybody out?
- Yes.

1038
00:33:24,200 --> 00:33:25,410
Okay!

1039
00:33:26,110 --> 00:33:27,620
- Really?
- How am I out?

1040
00:33:27,620 --> 00:33:29,350
Was it me?

1041
00:33:29,740 --> 00:33:30,940
Gosh, Jae Suk.

1042
00:33:31,240 --> 00:33:33,010
How did he get caught?

1043
00:33:33,410 --> 00:33:35,180
- I smelled him.
- You smelled him?

1044
00:33:35,180 --> 00:33:36,250
He smells good.

1045
00:33:36,250 --> 00:33:37,630
Move that way.

1046
00:33:37,630 --> 00:33:39,980
We have to make sounds
for each other.

1047
00:33:39,980 --> 00:33:42,330
You have to keep moving.

1048
00:33:42,330 --> 00:33:43,560
With potato chips.

1049
00:33:43,560 --> 00:33:46,160
- Oh, gosh.
- We're done for.

1050
00:33:46,300 --> 00:33:48,230
- I always get caught.
- With cheddar cheese.

1051
00:33:48,230 --> 00:33:49,730
Nacho? Microwaved.

1052
00:33:49,730 --> 00:33:50,930
Where are you?

1053
00:33:51,730 --> 00:33:53,840
I'm over here. I'm by the door.

1054
00:33:53,840 --> 00:33:55,000
- By the door?
- Yes.

1055
00:33:55,080 --> 00:33:56,340
We won't know when they come in.

1056
00:33:56,340 --> 00:33:57,350
(Kwang Soo is already nervous.)

1057
00:33:58,200 --> 00:33:59,380
- Oh, dear.
- What was that?

1058
00:33:59,440 --> 00:34:01,170
- What was that? What did I hit?
- Are they inside?

1059
00:34:01,210 --> 00:34:02,910
- Are they inside?
- I don't know.

1060
00:34:02,910 --> 00:34:04,210
Did I break something?
Where was that?

1061
00:34:04,210 --> 00:34:05,410
I don't think they're here yet.

1062
00:34:05,410 --> 00:34:06,410
(This team looks sloppy already.)

1063
00:34:07,250 --> 00:34:10,120
What's this? I can't see.

1064
00:34:10,390 --> 00:34:12,450
(They pass by Kwang Soo's territory
rather easily.)

1065
00:34:14,020 --> 00:34:16,620
(They see Chang Wook
waiting in ambush.)

1066
00:34:17,100 --> 00:34:18,730
- Where are they?
- They're inside.

1067
00:34:18,730 --> 00:34:20,390
They're inside.

1068
00:34:21,330 --> 00:34:22,830
(He stands up.)

1069
00:34:22,830 --> 00:34:25,730
(He's making way for them?)

1070
00:34:25,870 --> 00:34:27,330
- Are they inside?
- Are they?

1071
00:34:27,330 --> 00:34:28,440
(Grabbing)

1072
00:34:28,940 --> 00:34:30,170
(Canafe with vegetable tuna
on crackers)

1073
00:34:30,170 --> 00:34:32,410
- We have started.
- They're inside.

1074
00:34:32,750 --> 00:34:35,540
(Pear ice cream is in here.)

1075
00:34:36,350 --> 00:34:37,920
- What's this?
- Over here.

1076
00:34:37,920 --> 00:34:38,980
- Where?
- Where?

1077
00:34:38,980 --> 00:34:40,120
(Kwang Soo is worked up.)

1078
00:34:40,120 --> 00:34:41,350
- Here.
- Where?

1079
00:34:41,350 --> 00:34:43,160
Here. The freezer is open.
Who is this?

1080
00:34:43,160 --> 00:34:44,620
- Where?
- Here.

1081
00:34:44,620 --> 00:34:46,460
(Se Chan is getting cornered.)

1082
00:34:46,460 --> 00:34:48,020
- Here.
- Where?

1083
00:34:48,020 --> 00:34:49,500
- Over here.
- Where?

1084
00:34:50,120 --> 00:34:51,330
- Where?
- Here.

1085
00:34:51,370 --> 00:34:52,370
Where?

1086
00:34:52,370 --> 00:34:54,140
(Bang! Bang!)

1087
00:34:54,140 --> 00:34:57,500
Don't break things!

1088
00:34:58,040 --> 00:34:59,640
(He plays a warning alert.)

1089
00:34:59,830 --> 00:35:01,170
Somebody took ice cream.

1090
00:35:01,980 --> 00:35:03,140
Hey.

1091
00:35:03,230 --> 00:35:05,170
- Who are you?
- Are you okay? Me.

1092
00:35:05,170 --> 00:35:06,170
It's you.

1093
00:35:06,810 --> 00:35:09,080
- Where are you?
- Wait.

1094
00:35:09,080 --> 00:35:10,080
They're not here.

1095
00:35:10,080 --> 00:35:11,310
(He gets an item easily
from Kwang Soo's territory.)

1096
00:35:11,310 --> 00:35:12,420
Snacks!

1097
00:35:12,710 --> 00:35:14,020
- It's me.
- They're not here.

1098
00:35:14,020 --> 00:35:15,710
(He tries to get ice cream again.)

1099
00:35:15,710 --> 00:35:18,620
- Here. Ice cream!
- Where? Which one?

1100
00:35:18,620 --> 00:35:20,730
(He runs away in a hurry.)

1101
00:35:20,730 --> 00:35:21,750
Which one?

1102
00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:23,230
They got away.

1103
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:25,330
(These two dummies can't even
block the freezer.)

1104
00:35:25,330 --> 00:35:26,890
- This is open.
- I know.

1105
00:35:26,890 --> 00:35:28,690
They need something from here.

1106
00:35:31,140 --> 00:35:33,270
(They're like automatic doors.)

1107
00:35:33,270 --> 00:35:35,580
- They left.
- I heard the bell.

1108
00:35:35,600 --> 00:35:37,440
They left? They're already done?

1109
00:35:38,410 --> 00:35:39,980
- This is not the camera.
- What?

1110
00:35:39,980 --> 00:35:41,370
(He bumped into something.)

1111
00:35:41,370 --> 00:35:43,210
- Where are you?
- No, I'm in pain.

1112
00:35:43,640 --> 00:35:45,350
Wait, the microwave is done.

1113
00:35:45,350 --> 00:35:46,620
(Chang Wook, I'm coming to help!)

1114
00:35:47,310 --> 00:35:48,810
Where was it? I smell it.

1115
00:35:49,460 --> 00:35:50,460
(Zombie Ji smelled money
from the ATM.)

1116
00:35:50,460 --> 00:35:53,730
Is this it? Is this the microwave?

1117
00:35:54,100 --> 00:35:56,390
It's open. They can't take it.

1118
00:35:57,560 --> 00:35:59,230
(He finds tteokbokki
that was being made.)

1119
00:35:59,960 --> 00:36:01,560
(He's eating it with his hand?)

1120
00:36:01,560 --> 00:36:03,330
Kwang Soo, you can't eat that.

1121
00:36:03,370 --> 00:36:04,370
(This is a new way of defending.)

1122
00:36:04,370 --> 00:36:05,410
This is hot.

1123
00:36:06,310 --> 00:36:07,370
What are you eating?

1124
00:36:07,370 --> 00:36:08,870
This is hot. It's a rice cake.

1125
00:36:09,810 --> 00:36:10,980
What are you doing?

1126
00:36:11,080 --> 00:36:13,170
What's this?

1127
00:36:13,310 --> 00:36:16,420
(She felt something.)

1128
00:36:16,870 --> 00:36:18,140
What? Did they eat something?

1129
00:36:19,250 --> 00:36:20,710
(He holds his breath.)

1130
00:36:22,560 --> 00:36:25,660
(She can smell a man in his 30s.)

1131
00:36:26,190 --> 00:36:27,620
(Hitting)

1132
00:36:27,620 --> 00:36:29,020
Hey.

1133
00:36:29,020 --> 00:36:30,460
I got them!

1134
00:36:30,460 --> 00:36:32,370
- I got Se Chan.
- I was almost done.

1135
00:36:32,370 --> 00:36:34,230
- Se Chan is out.
- I got him.

1136
00:36:34,230 --> 00:36:36,370
(He was almost done.)

1137
00:36:36,790 --> 00:36:38,940
(There are 2 items
and 2 people left.)

1138
00:36:41,370 --> 00:36:42,480
They're over here!

1139
00:36:43,710 --> 00:36:44,980
(Chang Wook almost had him.)

1140
00:36:44,980 --> 00:36:46,540
- Where?
- Kwang Soo!

1141
00:36:46,540 --> 00:36:47,750
They got away.

1142
00:36:48,310 --> 00:36:50,020
- Who was it?
- By the door!

1143
00:36:50,020 --> 00:36:51,540
- They're getting away.
- Who was it?

1144
00:36:51,540 --> 00:36:52,980
(He runs away like a coward.)

1145
00:36:52,980 --> 00:36:54,810
- Where did he go?
- Where did he go?

1146
00:36:54,810 --> 00:36:57,250
- My gosh.
- What did you have to make?

1147
00:36:57,250 --> 00:36:59,190
- What is it?
- One person is out.

1148
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:02,120
Chang Wook. I smell something.

1149
00:37:02,350 --> 00:37:03,390
I smell something.

1150
00:37:03,460 --> 00:37:05,270
It's hot. I'm eating right now.

1151
00:37:05,270 --> 00:37:09,640
I smell something.
Kwang Soo, what are you eating?

1152
00:37:10,390 --> 00:37:11,830
(It's actually good.)

1153
00:37:11,830 --> 00:37:13,440
- I think it's tteokbokki.
- They're over here.

1154
00:37:13,460 --> 00:37:15,040
Ice cream!

1155
00:37:15,040 --> 00:37:17,310
(They're over here. Ice cream!)

1156
00:37:17,850 --> 00:37:20,080
- Ice cream!
- Ice cream!

1157
00:37:20,410 --> 00:37:22,140
Please don't hit too hard.

1158
00:37:22,140 --> 00:37:23,370
- Where are they?
- Where are they?

1159
00:37:23,370 --> 00:37:25,390
- Over here!
- It's me.

1160
00:37:26,390 --> 00:37:27,920
- This is good.
- What are you having?

1161
00:37:27,920 --> 00:37:29,120
- I want it too.
- I finished it.

1162
00:37:29,120 --> 00:37:30,210
You finished it?

1163
00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:32,890
Is it cheese or pizza tteokbokki?

1164
00:37:32,890 --> 00:37:34,620
(He enjoyed the food
without doing his job.)

1165
00:37:35,100 --> 00:37:36,520
(She's not even hiding,
and nobody is stopping her.)

1166
00:37:37,100 --> 00:37:38,730
(She's relaxed.)

1167
00:37:40,230 --> 00:37:43,190
(She finished the drink without
anybody interfering with her.)

1168
00:37:43,330 --> 00:37:46,230
- Hey.
- I heard a sound.

1169
00:37:46,670 --> 00:37:49,810
It's me! It's me!

1170
00:37:50,870 --> 00:37:52,350
- Hey, it's me.
- Where?

1171
00:37:52,350 --> 00:37:53,710
Hey, it's me.

1172
00:37:53,710 --> 00:37:55,310
- You brat!
- Where? My bad.

1173
00:37:56,120 --> 00:37:57,520
- Are you okay?
- Where are you?

1174
00:37:57,520 --> 00:37:59,520
Everybody, the mission is over.

1175
00:37:59,540 --> 00:38:00,620
They must be gone.

1176
00:38:00,920 --> 00:38:02,080
(Team Chang Wook used up
their energy for nothing.)

1177
00:38:02,080 --> 00:38:03,250
I heard something.

1178
00:38:03,620 --> 00:38:06,660
(Team Sang Woo is here
to block them.)

1179
00:38:07,160 --> 00:38:08,660
This is like cardio.

1180
00:38:08,660 --> 00:38:09,960
(This is like cardio.)

1181
00:38:10,330 --> 00:38:12,770
(Kwang Soo comes in ambitiously.)

1182
00:38:12,770 --> 00:38:14,190
- Who is this?
- I got someone.

1183
00:38:14,370 --> 00:38:15,940
Who is it? Who did you catch?

1184
00:38:16,330 --> 00:38:18,560
(He gives Chang Wook some tips
as he leaves.)

1185
00:38:19,500 --> 00:38:21,310
Gosh, I'm out already.

1186
00:38:22,170 --> 00:38:23,440
Okay.

1187
00:38:24,080 --> 00:38:26,040
Why is he holding a real hammer?

1188
00:38:26,910 --> 00:38:28,140
Isn't it a real hammer?

1189
00:38:28,140 --> 00:38:29,480
(Team Chang Wook's turn
ends in vain.)

1190
00:38:29,480 --> 00:38:32,120
Let me announce the results
of Sweet Combinations.

1191
00:38:32,210 --> 00:38:35,480
Team Sang Woo won
without getting caught...

1192
00:38:35,480 --> 00:38:36,580
for 7 minutes and 49 seconds.
They're in 1st place.

1193
00:38:36,580 --> 00:38:39,190
(Team Sang Woo won 1st place with
a record of 7 minutes 49 seconds.)

1194
00:38:39,190 --> 00:38:40,290
We're the best.

1195
00:38:40,290 --> 00:38:43,190
Team Sunhwa who finished
the mission with two members out...

1196
00:38:43,190 --> 00:38:44,330
in 10 minutes and 12 seconds
won 2nd place.

1197
00:38:44,520 --> 00:38:45,600
- Good.
- This is nice.

1198
00:38:45,770 --> 00:38:48,560
Team Chang Wook and Team Yoo Jung
are all out.

1199
00:38:48,940 --> 00:38:52,140
Team Chang Wook who held out for
11 minutes and 6 seconds is the 3rd.

1200
00:38:52,140 --> 00:38:53,230
Okay.

1201
00:38:53,230 --> 00:38:55,580
Team Yoo Jung is the 4th
with a record...

1202
00:38:55,580 --> 00:38:56,730
- of 5 minutes and 45 seconds.
- Only 5 minutes?

1203
00:38:56,730 --> 00:38:58,980
- That's a big difference.
- We were very quick though.

1204
00:38:59,310 --> 00:39:01,040
Let's move to the next place...

1205
00:39:01,040 --> 00:39:03,020
and pick the first item.

1206
00:39:03,020 --> 00:39:04,190
- Okay.
- Let's go.

1207
00:39:04,310 --> 00:39:05,520
- Well done.
- Okay.

1208
00:39:05,520 --> 00:39:06,540
(What's the popular convenience
store item they will pick?)

1209
00:39:07,250 --> 00:39:08,980
Do we have two spies here?

1210
00:39:08,980 --> 00:39:10,960
- Brokers.
- What do brokers do?

1211
00:39:10,960 --> 00:39:12,660
- What's the deal with the brokers?
- What are the brokers for?

1212
00:39:12,750 --> 00:39:13,890
What do they do?

1213
00:39:13,890 --> 00:39:15,690
The brokers...

1214
00:39:15,750 --> 00:39:17,120
already threw...

1215
00:39:17,500 --> 00:39:21,270
their offers many times
while performing the mission.

1216
00:39:21,540 --> 00:39:22,870
- Really?
- What?

1217
00:39:22,870 --> 00:39:24,000
- They threw their offers?
- To whom?

1218
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:25,040
When did they do that?

1219
00:39:26,230 --> 00:39:29,870
(The two brokers were told
to offer their proposal earlier.)

1220
00:39:29,870 --> 00:39:31,000
(Take a picture of the name tag
or write down...)

1221
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:32,100
(the name of the person
you want to propose a deal to.)

1222
00:39:32,580 --> 00:39:36,870
(During the mission, the brokers
approached the production crew.)

1223
00:39:36,920 --> 00:39:38,850
They offer their proposal
to the production crew?

1224
00:39:38,850 --> 00:39:40,440
To the production crew? I see.

1225
00:39:41,120 --> 00:39:43,460
What happens
if we catch the brokers?

1226
00:39:43,460 --> 00:39:44,980
If you find out the brokers,

1227
00:39:45,060 --> 00:39:47,520
you will get
a doubling sticker per each.

1228
00:39:47,890 --> 00:39:49,890
You can double your points
with the sticker.

1229
00:39:50,100 --> 00:39:51,290
It's a good one.

1230
00:39:51,290 --> 00:39:53,100
- If you fail to find the brokers...
- We should catch them.

1231
00:39:53,100 --> 00:39:54,370
Who are the brokers?

1232
00:39:54,870 --> 00:39:57,290
Suk Jin just said that
when he doesn't even care.

1233
00:39:57,910 --> 00:39:59,330
I thought he was
talking in his sleep.

1234
00:39:59,330 --> 00:40:00,540
Chang Wook, are you the broker?

1235
00:40:00,940 --> 00:40:02,830
(He yells at Chang Wook
all of a sudden.)

1236
00:40:02,830 --> 00:40:03,910
- He just yelled out of the blue.
- I didn't even say anything.

1237
00:40:03,910 --> 00:40:05,100
- Who is it?
- What's wrong with you?

1238
00:40:05,100 --> 00:40:06,310
I think...

1239
00:40:06,310 --> 00:40:08,920
this is what Suk Jin can do.

1240
00:40:09,020 --> 00:40:10,710
I think so. It's no big deal.

1241
00:40:10,710 --> 00:40:12,710
- It's not that big a deal.
- I know.

1242
00:40:12,980 --> 00:40:14,750
- It's a small role.
- Even if he gets caught,

1243
00:40:14,750 --> 00:40:16,850
- it doesn't ruin the whole race.
- I know.

1244
00:40:16,850 --> 00:40:18,520
- Suk Jin sounds right for it.
- That's what Suk Jin can do.

1245
00:40:18,520 --> 00:40:19,620
It doesn't affect the whole race.

1246
00:40:19,620 --> 00:40:22,520
- He seems so happy to be suspected.
- It's you, right?

1247
00:40:22,520 --> 00:40:23,730
Yes. Sure.

1248
00:40:26,290 --> 00:40:27,730
- How did you know?
- It can't be him.

1249
00:40:27,730 --> 00:40:29,600
- It's not him.
- My gosh.

1250
00:40:29,940 --> 00:40:31,060
I shouldn't suspect him.

1251
00:40:31,060 --> 00:40:32,140
- Chang Wook.
- Yes?

1252
00:40:32,140 --> 00:40:34,040
Who do you think the brokers are?

1253
00:40:34,230 --> 00:40:36,170
I think it's either Sunhwa...

1254
00:40:36,580 --> 00:40:37,600
I agree.

1255
00:40:37,600 --> 00:40:39,440
Can you tell us the truth,
swearing on our drama?

1256
00:40:39,440 --> 00:40:40,600
- You're the broker, aren't you?
- No.

1257
00:40:40,600 --> 00:40:42,620
She even mentioned her drama.
They sound serious.

1258
00:40:43,170 --> 00:40:44,940
Why would you say it on our drama?

1259
00:40:44,940 --> 00:40:46,710
Can you swear on our drama
that you're not the broker?

1260
00:40:46,710 --> 00:40:48,290
That's not what we do.

1261
00:40:48,290 --> 00:40:50,080
What will you do with your drama?

1262
00:40:50,790 --> 00:40:52,560
- It's just...
- What if you're lying?

1263
00:40:52,560 --> 00:40:53,730
We will leave the drama.

1264
00:40:53,920 --> 00:40:55,830
- Leave the drama?
- Leave?

1265
00:40:55,830 --> 00:40:57,190
- What?
- Leave the drama?

1266
00:40:57,460 --> 00:40:59,020
- Do you have to do that?
- Why would you quit it?

1267
00:40:59,020 --> 00:41:00,940
He's right. We should enjoy.

1268
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:04,040
It'll be funny if you quit the drama
because of Running Man.

1269
00:41:04,730 --> 00:41:05,810
(Sunhwa leaves the drama because
of her promise with Running Man.)

1270
00:41:05,810 --> 00:41:07,830
"I have no choice. I made
my promise with them."

1271
00:41:08,140 --> 00:41:09,170
"What's the reason?"

1272
00:41:09,440 --> 00:41:11,750
- "In Running Man..."
- I was the broker in Running Man.

1273
00:41:13,140 --> 00:41:15,210
"I have no choice. I made
my promise with them."

1274
00:41:15,640 --> 00:41:17,210
"I hid the fact
that I was the broker."

1275
00:41:18,940 --> 00:41:22,520
Is the mission for the brokers
something like this?

1276
00:41:22,520 --> 00:41:24,460
- Hey, Bones. Stay quiet.
- Bones.

1277
00:41:24,580 --> 00:41:25,690
- Me?
- Which one?

1278
00:41:25,690 --> 00:41:28,060
- He has bones.
- He has bones on his shirt.

1279
00:41:28,060 --> 00:41:29,350
I see. That's what he means.

1280
00:41:29,350 --> 00:41:32,330
Why did you put this on?
Dream can't go out because of you.

1281
00:41:33,520 --> 00:41:35,640
(As Jong Kook makes
a slight joke,)

1282
00:41:35,640 --> 00:41:36,670
(they burst into laughter.)

1283
00:41:36,670 --> 00:41:37,810
You're wearing Dream's shirt.

1284
00:41:39,310 --> 00:41:41,080
Do you know what's funny here?

1285
00:41:41,210 --> 00:41:43,210
Only his two underlings
laugh at his joke.

1286
00:41:43,330 --> 00:41:44,370
No one else laughed.

1287
00:41:46,170 --> 00:41:48,080
(While everyone is quiet,)

1288
00:41:48,080 --> 00:41:50,140
(only the two of them
burst into laughter.)

1289
00:41:50,520 --> 00:41:51,690
- Only the two underlings.
- Hey.

1290
00:41:51,690 --> 00:41:53,120
(The original underling
studies Jong Kook's face quietly.)

1291
00:41:53,120 --> 00:41:54,620
- Why would you call us underlings?
- No one laughed.

1292
00:41:54,620 --> 00:41:56,190
Use good words. Like subordinates.

1293
00:41:56,190 --> 00:41:57,310
Only his underlings...

1294
00:41:57,310 --> 00:41:59,390
Only his subordinates are laughing.
No one else laughed.

1295
00:41:59,460 --> 00:42:01,100
Why did you not laugh?
You're his underling number four.

1296
00:42:01,330 --> 00:42:02,390
Because...

1297
00:42:03,060 --> 00:42:05,330
(She bursts into laughter
as if she was waiting.)

1298
00:42:05,420 --> 00:42:06,460
(Our captain is so funny.)

1299
00:42:06,460 --> 00:42:07,560
He's really funny.

1300
00:42:07,830 --> 00:42:08,870
Good.

1301
00:42:09,190 --> 00:42:11,710
Jong Kook, your underling
number five is not laughing.

1302
00:42:12,770 --> 00:42:14,310
- He's laughing now.
- He's laughing quietly.

1303
00:42:14,730 --> 00:42:16,140
- He's laughing now.
- He's laughing quietly.

1304
00:42:16,670 --> 00:42:18,080
He was laughing quietly.

1305
00:42:18,640 --> 00:42:20,140
I'm number four.

1306
00:42:20,140 --> 00:42:21,770
- He says he's number 4.
- "I'm number 4."

1307
00:42:21,770 --> 00:42:22,940
Suk Jin is...

1308
00:42:23,480 --> 00:42:25,040
You guys are mistaken. He's a mole.

1309
00:42:25,040 --> 00:42:28,020
(They head to the next destination
ranking the underlings.)

1310
00:42:29,710 --> 00:42:30,790
Everyone.

1311
00:42:31,020 --> 00:42:33,690
It's time to pick
your first hot item.

1312
00:42:34,160 --> 00:42:37,160
Team Sang Woo won
the convenience store mission.

1313
00:42:37,230 --> 00:42:39,560
You get to pick one item you want
and put it on your table.

1314
00:42:39,670 --> 00:42:41,670
There are two kinds of water.
The big one and the small one.

1315
00:42:41,670 --> 00:42:44,140
What matters is how many of them
were sold.

1316
00:42:44,640 --> 00:42:46,000
There are many kinds of water.

1317
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:49,170
For your information, the brokers
might want to pick bad items...

1318
00:42:49,170 --> 00:42:51,100
on purpose for the competition.

1319
00:42:51,100 --> 00:42:52,710
(The brokers might induce
their members to pick bad items.)

1320
00:42:52,710 --> 00:42:53,980
Can we pick three items?

1321
00:42:53,980 --> 00:42:55,810
- No, only one.
- We get to pick one.

1322
00:42:56,170 --> 00:42:57,440
- Triangular gimbap?
- Triangular gimbap.

1323
00:42:57,440 --> 00:42:59,210
- I should pick triangular gimbap.
- Let's do that.

1324
00:43:00,960 --> 00:43:02,060
- Triangular gimbap?
- Isn't this it?

1325
00:43:02,060 --> 00:43:04,480
Hang on. What if
triangular gimbap is sold out?

1326
00:43:04,480 --> 00:43:07,190
If you pick the most popular item,
you will get 15 points.

1327
00:43:07,190 --> 00:43:08,420
And 14 points
for the second popular item.

1328
00:43:08,690 --> 00:43:10,160
You get 1 point for the 15th item.

1329
00:43:10,160 --> 00:43:11,500
All right. I guess this is it.

1330
00:43:11,500 --> 00:43:12,620
- Triangular gimbap?
- No.

1331
00:43:12,960 --> 00:43:14,100
- Is it over?
- Are you done?

1332
00:43:14,100 --> 00:43:15,270
Yes. We picked triangular gimbap.

1333
00:43:15,270 --> 00:43:16,540
- Okay.
- It's triangular gimbap.

1334
00:43:16,540 --> 00:43:17,640
Who's next?

1335
00:43:17,640 --> 00:43:20,600
There are a lot of popular items.

1336
00:43:20,810 --> 00:43:23,040
- This is red bean jelly.
- Hang on. I think...

1337
00:43:23,670 --> 00:43:25,750
it's either cup noodles or water.

1338
00:43:25,750 --> 00:43:27,440
No. Just trust me this once.

1339
00:43:27,580 --> 00:43:28,640
All right then.

1340
00:43:28,640 --> 00:43:29,640
Let's go with that.

1341
00:43:29,640 --> 00:43:31,310
- I guess he's right.
- We picked this.

1342
00:43:31,440 --> 00:43:33,390
- Is that what you got?
- Okay.

1343
00:43:33,390 --> 00:43:34,580
Are you sure?

1344
00:43:34,580 --> 00:43:36,960
(Team Sunhwa picks cup noodles
as Se Chan insists.)

1345
00:43:36,960 --> 00:43:38,960
They picked cup noodles.

1346
00:43:39,580 --> 00:43:40,750
I'm sure about this.

1347
00:43:41,460 --> 00:43:42,690
It's a 500ml bottle of water.

1348
00:43:42,690 --> 00:43:44,290
(They pick 500ml water
in confidence.)

1349
00:43:44,290 --> 00:43:46,330
- Do you have any idea?
- Sausage.

1350
00:43:46,520 --> 00:43:50,000
- But people don't eat it a lot.
- No, it must be sausage.

1351
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:51,500
- I don't think so.
- Suk Jin.

1352
00:43:51,500 --> 00:43:52,910
- But...
- I'm telling you.

1353
00:43:52,910 --> 00:43:54,140
- Is he the broker?
- I don't think it's popular.

1354
00:43:54,140 --> 00:43:55,600
- No, I'm serious.
- It doesn't sound right.

1355
00:43:55,600 --> 00:43:57,140
- People don't eat it a lot.
- Do people really eat it a lot?

1356
00:43:57,140 --> 00:43:58,600
I read something.

1357
00:43:58,600 --> 00:43:59,910
- Are you serious?
- Yes.

1358
00:44:00,080 --> 00:44:01,080
No.

1359
00:44:01,080 --> 00:44:02,580
- Isn't it soda?
- I'm sure this is it.

1360
00:44:02,580 --> 00:44:03,920
- Are you sure?
- Seriously?

1361
00:44:03,920 --> 00:44:05,120
- Yes.
- What about chewing gum?

1362
00:44:05,120 --> 00:44:06,520
I don't think so.

1363
00:44:06,520 --> 00:44:08,520
- Are you sure?
- What about ice cream?

1364
00:44:08,790 --> 00:44:10,750
Are you serious?
Do you not want to pick ice cream?

1365
00:44:10,750 --> 00:44:13,790
He's the broker. He's being strange.

1366
00:44:13,790 --> 00:44:15,230
(Jae Suk picks sausage
despite the strong opposition.)

1367
00:44:15,230 --> 00:44:17,120
- We eat ice cream even in winter.
- You're the broker.

1368
00:44:17,120 --> 00:44:18,190
I'm telling you.

1369
00:44:18,190 --> 00:44:20,120
Jae seok is the broker.

1370
00:44:20,120 --> 00:44:22,100
- I think he's the broker.
- You're the broker.

1371
00:44:22,100 --> 00:44:23,440
(Jae Suk is being suspicious.
Is he really the broker?)

1372
00:44:23,440 --> 00:44:25,100
I'm sure about this. Listen to me.

1373
00:44:25,100 --> 00:44:26,170
Why would we listen to you?

1374
00:44:26,170 --> 00:44:29,580
You're unreliable.

1375
00:44:30,980 --> 00:44:32,410
You can't pick what you like.

1376
00:44:32,410 --> 00:44:34,210
Jae Suk, you don't even
go to a convenience store.

1377
00:44:34,310 --> 00:44:37,310
We don't have anything else to pick.
Just listen to me this once.

1378
00:44:37,440 --> 00:44:38,640
- Come here.
- What about ice cream?

1379
00:44:38,890 --> 00:44:40,140
What about fish cake bar?

1380
00:44:40,210 --> 00:44:41,660
- What about ice cream?
- What do you mean?

1381
00:44:42,890 --> 00:44:44,290
Just come here, Yoo Jung.

1382
00:44:44,420 --> 00:44:46,920
(They are all done
picking their first items.)

1383
00:44:46,920 --> 00:44:48,330
You guys made your choice.

1384
00:44:48,420 --> 00:44:51,870
Now I will reveal the offers
from the brokers made in Round One.

1385
00:44:51,870 --> 00:44:53,270
(The offers from the two brokers
are revealed now.)

1386
00:44:54,230 --> 00:44:56,230
The first broker, A...

1387
00:44:57,600 --> 00:44:59,100
made an offer to Team Sang Woo.

1388
00:44:59,100 --> 00:45:00,310
(Broker A made an offer
to Team Sang Woo.)

1389
00:45:00,310 --> 00:45:02,440
- I didn't hear it.
- And Broker B made...

1390
00:45:02,440 --> 00:45:05,940
an offer to Team Sunhwa,
Yoo Jung, and Chang Wook.

1391
00:45:05,940 --> 00:45:07,000
Even to us?

1392
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:08,520
I guess they tried to confuse us.

1393
00:45:09,420 --> 00:45:10,670
- Broker B is...
- We can catch them.

1394
00:45:10,940 --> 00:45:12,040
Oh, my.

1395
00:45:12,040 --> 00:45:14,960
Now you should think about it.
If you accept the offer,

1396
00:45:15,420 --> 00:45:17,210
you can pick one more item.

1397
00:45:17,210 --> 00:45:18,250
(If they accept the offer,
they can pick one more item.)

1398
00:45:18,250 --> 00:45:20,250
But if you accept it,
the broker will...

1399
00:45:20,250 --> 00:45:22,350
also get one more chance
to pick an item.

1400
00:45:22,350 --> 00:45:24,560
- What's the offer?
- What if we don't accept it?

1401
00:45:24,560 --> 00:45:26,790
You can't pick an extra item,

1402
00:45:26,870 --> 00:45:28,540
but you can get a hint
about the broker.

1403
00:45:28,540 --> 00:45:30,500
- Let's not accept it then.
- Okay.

1404
00:45:30,500 --> 00:45:32,810
We'd better get a hint.

1405
00:45:32,810 --> 00:45:34,000
- I think getting a hint is better.
- If we pick one more item...

1406
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:35,080
Let's get a hint.

1407
00:45:35,080 --> 00:45:36,710
Let's just accept the offer.

1408
00:45:37,040 --> 00:45:38,140
We should accept it.

1409
00:45:38,310 --> 00:45:40,770
- No. Are you the broker?
- I'm not.

1410
00:45:40,770 --> 00:45:42,520
We should find out
who the brokers are.

1411
00:45:42,620 --> 00:45:44,940
- Do you want to get a hint?
- We can double our points.

1412
00:45:44,940 --> 00:45:46,190
Let's accept the offer.

1413
00:45:46,190 --> 00:45:47,810
- What do you want to do?
- We should accept it.

1414
00:45:48,120 --> 00:45:49,520
- I'm thinking about it.
- We should get it.

1415
00:45:49,520 --> 00:45:50,580
Do you want to get a hint?

1416
00:45:50,580 --> 00:45:52,020
It will be over if our team wins.

1417
00:45:52,020 --> 00:45:53,730
If you're not the broker,
you won't accept the offer.

1418
00:45:54,690 --> 00:45:55,830
(Team Chang Wook wants
to accept the broker's offer.)

1419
00:45:55,830 --> 00:45:57,830
Captain Kim, we will
follow your opinion.

1420
00:45:58,020 --> 00:46:00,420
- I think it's okay to accept one.
- Okay.

1421
00:46:00,520 --> 00:46:03,230
Our captain, Yoo Jung,
wants to accept the offer.

1422
00:46:03,230 --> 00:46:05,460
- Are you accepting the offer?
- Yes.

1423
00:46:06,100 --> 00:46:07,500
We want to accept the offer too.

1424
00:46:07,500 --> 00:46:09,170
- We will accept it.
- We will accept the offer.

1425
00:46:09,170 --> 00:46:10,770
They accepted it before you did,
so they get to pick first.

1426
00:46:10,770 --> 00:46:11,980
- Okay.
- Good.

1427
00:46:11,980 --> 00:46:13,500
- Captain Kim.
- We made a good choice.

1428
00:46:13,500 --> 00:46:16,250
The brokers can pick
the same items later.

1429
00:46:16,870 --> 00:46:18,710
- This is about the number of sales.
- Exactly.

1430
00:46:19,120 --> 00:46:20,420
Do you want ice cream?

1431
00:46:20,420 --> 00:46:21,920
(Captain Kim wants
to pick ice cream.)

1432
00:46:21,920 --> 00:46:23,060
Do you want it? Okay.

1433
00:46:23,060 --> 00:46:25,290
- Wait. Ice cream and...
- This isn't right.

1434
00:46:25,290 --> 00:46:26,660
That's what she wants.

1435
00:46:27,520 --> 00:46:29,330
- Captain Kim, bring this.
- What?

1436
00:46:29,460 --> 00:46:31,020
She picked ice cream.

1437
00:46:31,020 --> 00:46:33,060
- It's just the color of your shirt.
- That's what our captain wants.

1438
00:46:33,060 --> 00:46:35,830
- They picked only strange ones.
- It matches their shirt.

1439
00:46:35,940 --> 00:46:37,730
We picked this.

1440
00:46:37,730 --> 00:46:39,170
Corn tea?

1441
00:46:39,170 --> 00:46:40,310
But you wanted this.

1442
00:46:40,460 --> 00:46:41,830
I didn't see this coming.

1443
00:46:42,100 --> 00:46:43,170
Okay.

1444
00:46:43,170 --> 00:46:45,850
- What did you say before?
- We'll pick Chapaghetti.

1445
00:46:46,480 --> 00:46:49,420
- Let's take the risk.
- We will accept the offer.

1446
00:46:49,420 --> 00:46:50,520
(Team Sang Woo accepts the offer
and picks a lighter.)

1447
00:46:50,520 --> 00:46:52,020
- A lighter?
- Yes.

1448
00:46:52,020 --> 00:46:53,620
The brokers must be excited.

1449
00:46:53,620 --> 00:46:54,890
(The brokers get to pick
more items as well.)

1450
00:46:54,890 --> 00:46:56,350
- We all accepted the offer.
- All right then.

1451
00:46:56,350 --> 00:46:58,520
All the four teams
accepted the offer.

1452
00:46:58,520 --> 00:47:00,190
Let's move on to the second mission.

1453
00:47:00,190 --> 00:47:02,390
(Hot Item Selection Status)

1454
00:47:02,390 --> 00:47:03,660
The second mission is...

1455
00:47:03,660 --> 00:47:05,790
Your Fate in Your Hands
where you control...

1456
00:47:05,790 --> 00:47:07,370
the fate of your own team.

1457
00:47:07,890 --> 00:47:09,540
Do you see the water balloons
over your heads?

1458
00:47:09,540 --> 00:47:11,100
They have water in them.

1459
00:47:11,460 --> 00:47:12,910
And it has 10 layers of balloons.

1460
00:47:13,710 --> 00:47:15,940
We will give you
an eyebrow razor later.

1461
00:47:15,940 --> 00:47:19,000
You can cut it carefully,
you can survive 10 times.

1462
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:20,480
If you do it wrong,
it will burst immediately.

1463
00:47:20,480 --> 00:47:22,620
- I'm scared.
- I know what it is.

1464
00:47:22,620 --> 00:47:25,040
If we do it right, it won't
burst for 10 times.

1465
00:47:25,040 --> 00:47:26,520
So this is what you're going to do.

1466
00:47:26,690 --> 00:47:29,020
The production crew
will present a question.

1467
00:47:29,080 --> 00:47:31,350
And you will name a member
to the question.

1468
00:47:31,350 --> 00:47:34,250
The rest of the members will hear it
and guess what the question is.

1469
00:47:34,250 --> 00:47:37,060
If your balloon bursts,
you will get one more balloon.

1470
00:47:37,060 --> 00:47:38,520
You get two balloons.

1471
00:47:38,770 --> 00:47:40,230
The first team to pop the two
balloons will lose the game.

1472
00:47:40,230 --> 00:47:41,500
- Okay.
- And the 2nd one is in 3rd place.

1473
00:47:41,500 --> 00:47:43,330
- I want to win.
- Then you should decide...

1474
00:47:43,330 --> 00:47:46,040
who will answer the question.

1475
00:47:46,330 --> 00:47:47,500
So Min.

1476
00:47:48,170 --> 00:47:51,080
But So Min is quite imaginative.

1477
00:47:51,080 --> 00:47:52,940
Pick one question...

1478
00:47:52,940 --> 00:47:55,480
and tell them your answer
to the question.

1479
00:47:55,480 --> 00:47:56,620
Tell them your opinion.

1480
00:47:58,210 --> 00:48:00,040
This question is tricky.

1481
00:48:00,040 --> 00:48:01,960
- The question is too hard.
- Is it hard?

1482
00:48:01,960 --> 00:48:03,080
What is it, So Min?

1483
00:48:03,160 --> 00:48:04,980
- It's not about love.
- Is that so?

1484
00:48:04,980 --> 00:48:06,620
- It's about the opposite sex.
- Okay.

1485
00:48:06,620 --> 00:48:07,690
(Who does So Min think is top 1
regarding this question?)

1486
00:48:07,690 --> 00:48:09,230
It's about the opposite sex.

1487
00:48:09,230 --> 00:48:11,620
The answer is clear.

1488
00:48:11,620 --> 00:48:13,370
- Anyone would have chosen him.
- Who?

1489
00:48:13,560 --> 00:48:14,640
Jae Suk.

1490
00:48:14,640 --> 00:48:16,040
(Top 1 is Jae Suk.)

1491
00:48:16,040 --> 00:48:17,170
- I am serious.
- Let me answer.

1492
00:48:17,690 --> 00:48:18,870
(Haha is ready to answer
right away.)

1493
00:48:18,870 --> 00:48:21,370
- The person who is ugly in my eyes.
- No.

1494
00:48:21,370 --> 00:48:24,140
- The person who is ugly in my eyes.
- I didn't try to throw people off.

1495
00:48:24,140 --> 00:48:25,870
- The answer is clear.
- Did you think of him right away?

1496
00:48:25,870 --> 00:48:27,350
Other people just don't fit.

1497
00:48:27,350 --> 00:48:29,170
There is only one possible answer.

1498
00:48:29,170 --> 00:48:30,480
Yoo Jae Suk.

1499
00:48:30,540 --> 00:48:32,310
You are Michael Jordan
of this question.

1500
00:48:33,040 --> 00:48:34,790
Had this been an encyclopedia entry,

1501
00:48:34,790 --> 00:48:36,980
- his name would have been there.
- Really?

1502
00:48:36,980 --> 00:48:39,520
The man who shouldn't take off
his glasses before women.

1503
00:48:39,890 --> 00:48:40,960
Let me answer.

1504
00:48:41,190 --> 00:48:43,600
The man who thinks
he is popular among women.

1505
00:48:43,600 --> 00:48:44,730
- Incorrect.
- The man who is delusional.

1506
00:48:44,730 --> 00:48:45,790
You are nowhere near the answer.

1507
00:48:46,460 --> 00:48:49,100
- Jae Suk...
- I can't get it right.

1508
00:48:49,100 --> 00:48:51,640
The production crew agrees
with So Min's answer.

1509
00:48:51,640 --> 00:48:52,830
- Really?
- Everyone agrees.

1510
00:48:52,830 --> 00:48:54,910
The answer has to be Jae Suk.

1511
00:48:54,910 --> 00:48:57,370
Even if I choose the top two,
the gap would be too big.

1512
00:48:57,370 --> 00:48:59,750
Jae Suk is way up there.

1513
00:48:59,750 --> 00:49:01,420
- Really?
- Is he way up there?

1514
00:49:01,420 --> 00:49:02,640
It must be something
about appearances.

1515
00:49:02,640 --> 00:49:04,040
- Is it about being rich?
- Appearances?

1516
00:49:04,040 --> 00:49:05,250
Is it about being rich?

1517
00:49:05,390 --> 00:49:07,080
Why would it be about being rich?

1518
00:49:07,080 --> 00:49:08,890
You lack in so many ways.

1519
00:49:08,980 --> 00:49:11,230
- It's hard to choose one.
- Why would you say that?

1520
00:49:11,230 --> 00:49:13,420
- It's true. You lack...
- Let me answer.

1521
00:49:13,580 --> 00:49:15,690
The man whose child
must take after his or her mother.

1522
00:49:15,690 --> 00:49:16,750
Incorrect.

1523
00:49:16,920 --> 00:49:18,330
Is it a good thing or a bad thing?

1524
00:49:18,330 --> 00:49:20,330
It's a good thing...

1525
00:49:20,390 --> 00:49:21,890
because you are Yoo Jae Suk.

1526
00:49:21,890 --> 00:49:23,730
- Is it a good thing?
- If there is someone like him...

1527
00:49:23,730 --> 00:49:26,540
who isn't Yoo Jae Suk,
it would be really bad.

1528
00:49:26,540 --> 00:49:27,640
Someone like him
who isn't Yoo Jae Suk?

1529
00:49:27,640 --> 00:49:30,330
- Then it would be really bad.
- Yes.

1530
00:49:30,330 --> 00:49:32,250
You are saying it's a good thing
that he is Yoo Jae Suk.

1531
00:49:32,250 --> 00:49:34,410
It's a good thing
that he is Yoo Jae Suk.

1532
00:49:34,710 --> 00:49:37,350
Would you give us a motion hint
that fits the situation?

1533
00:49:37,350 --> 00:49:38,920
- This is hard.
- Right, give us a motion hint.

1534
00:49:38,920 --> 00:49:40,390
A motion hint?

1535
00:49:40,390 --> 00:49:42,460
Hello, everyone. I am Yoo Jae Suk.

1536
00:49:42,460 --> 00:49:43,580
Today...

1537
00:49:44,020 --> 00:49:45,580
(Fans cheers upon seeing Jae Suk.)

1538
00:49:45,580 --> 00:49:48,230
- Jae Suk! Let's shake hands.
- Let me answer.

1539
00:49:48,230 --> 00:49:50,850
The man who should be glad
that he became a celebrity.

1540
00:49:51,190 --> 00:49:52,560
(Incorrect)

1541
00:49:52,890 --> 00:49:54,390
It's close to the answer.

1542
00:49:54,390 --> 00:49:55,600
- Right?
- Is it close?

1543
00:49:55,600 --> 00:49:56,730
- Yes, it is.
- I knew it.

1544
00:49:56,730 --> 00:49:58,040
Okay, okay.

1545
00:49:59,270 --> 00:50:00,560
Come on, guys.

1546
00:50:00,910 --> 00:50:01,940
Let me answer.

1547
00:50:01,940 --> 00:50:03,500
The man who wouldn't have succeeded
if he weren't a celebrity.

1548
00:50:03,500 --> 00:50:05,410
The man who wouldn't have married
if he weren't a celebrity.

1549
00:50:05,410 --> 00:50:07,980
The man who would be a celebrity
even in his next life.

1550
00:50:08,980 --> 00:50:11,520
The man who is popular among women
only because he is a celebrity.

1551
00:50:11,710 --> 00:50:12,710
Yes!

1552
00:50:12,710 --> 00:50:15,120
(Correct)

1553
00:50:17,750 --> 00:50:19,830
How could you say that?

1554
00:50:20,520 --> 00:50:23,620
(They finally understand why
Jae Suk is top 1 by a landslide.)

1555
00:50:23,890 --> 00:50:25,770
(Jong Kook gives a ceremony
with a man who avoided misfortune.)

1556
00:50:25,770 --> 00:50:26,890
Thank you.

1557
00:50:27,100 --> 00:50:29,600
- So Min, that was neat.
- Thank you.

1558
00:50:29,600 --> 00:50:30,890
- That was neat.
- Thank you.

1559
00:50:30,890 --> 00:50:32,230
- I chose the right one.
- That was neat.

1560
00:50:32,560 --> 00:50:34,910
It hit me.

1561
00:50:34,910 --> 00:50:37,170
"Only because he is a celebrity"
was like a wakeup call.

1562
00:50:37,870 --> 00:50:38,870
It's true.

1563
00:50:38,870 --> 00:50:42,310
Let's start with this team.
Slash the balloon once.

1564
00:50:42,440 --> 00:50:43,710
Should I do it?

1565
00:50:43,710 --> 00:50:45,210
How much do we need to slash?

1566
00:50:45,310 --> 00:50:47,580
While it can be small,
at least one layer must come off.

1567
00:50:47,580 --> 00:50:49,210
- This is scary.
- Do it like this.

1568
00:50:49,210 --> 00:50:50,660
- Slash lightly.
- Do it lightly.

1569
00:50:50,660 --> 00:50:51,730
There you go.

1570
00:50:52,390 --> 00:50:53,690
- Do it lightly.
- There you go.

1571
00:50:53,690 --> 00:50:56,350
(One layer came off
when she put the blade against it.)

1572
00:50:56,350 --> 00:50:57,520
It came off so easily.

1573
00:50:59,020 --> 00:51:00,330
That was no joke.

1574
00:51:00,330 --> 00:51:01,460
- It's a different color.
- She barely touched it.

1575
00:51:01,460 --> 00:51:03,100
- It was so scary.
- She barely touched it.

1576
00:51:03,100 --> 00:51:04,600
- Team Ji Chang Wook.
- Who wants to go first?

1577
00:51:04,600 --> 00:51:06,170
- Do you want to go first?
- Hold on.

1578
00:51:06,170 --> 00:51:07,270
You need to sit down and do it.

1579
00:51:07,270 --> 00:51:08,480
- Do I need to sit down?
- Of course.

1580
00:51:09,330 --> 00:51:11,350
- This is insane.
- Do it gently.

1581
00:51:11,350 --> 00:51:12,480
Give it a small poke.

1582
00:51:14,580 --> 00:51:15,640
A small poke.

1583
00:51:24,360 --> 00:51:27,570
I can't do it. Hold on.

1584
00:51:27,570 --> 00:51:29,280
Do it the second time.

1585
00:51:29,280 --> 00:51:30,380
- Go first.
- Okay.

1586
00:51:31,240 --> 00:51:32,450
- A small poke.
- I'll try my best.

1587
00:51:32,700 --> 00:51:34,110
- I will slash it here.
- A small poke.

1588
00:51:34,470 --> 00:51:36,450
- Hold on.
- You need to slash it.

1589
00:51:36,650 --> 00:51:37,820
This is nerve-wracking.

1590
00:51:38,150 --> 00:51:39,280
How did you do it?

1591
00:51:39,510 --> 00:51:42,260
(The blade hasn't even touched
the balloon yet.)

1592
00:51:42,260 --> 00:51:43,450
A small poke.

1593
00:51:43,450 --> 00:51:44,860
The blade touched the balloon,
but it wouldn't pop.

1594
00:51:44,860 --> 00:51:45,990
The blade...

1595
00:51:45,990 --> 00:51:47,200
(They are overreacting.)

1596
00:51:47,200 --> 00:51:48,950
- The blade touched the balloon.
- It didn't touch the balloon.

1597
00:51:48,950 --> 00:51:50,070
What's wrong with you guys?

1598
00:51:53,070 --> 00:51:54,200
Hey, this is...

1599
00:51:54,200 --> 00:51:55,200
(Chang Wook gets too scared
and tosses it to Kwang Soo.)

1600
00:51:55,200 --> 00:51:56,260
Give it a light poke.

1601
00:51:56,400 --> 00:51:57,840
It isn't working.

1602
00:51:57,840 --> 00:51:59,410
- Kwang Soo, drive it in there.
- Come on.

1603
00:52:00,700 --> 00:52:01,880
Drive it in there.

1604
00:52:02,110 --> 00:52:03,910
(It popped!)

1605
00:52:06,510 --> 00:52:08,240
I did it really gently.

1606
00:52:09,740 --> 00:52:11,180
- Hey.
- I did it really gently.

1607
00:52:11,590 --> 00:52:13,260
- Good job.
- I did it really gently.

1608
00:52:13,260 --> 00:52:15,110
- Good job.
- Good job.

1609
00:52:15,110 --> 00:52:16,360
- Good job.
- I did it really gently.

1610
00:52:16,360 --> 00:52:17,590
- Kwang Soo.
- Yes?

1611
00:52:17,590 --> 00:52:19,360
You really slashed all 10 layers.

1612
00:52:19,360 --> 00:52:20,700
I just put the blade gently
against the balloon.

1613
00:52:20,700 --> 00:52:22,660
- How did you do it?
- Sunhwa did a great job.

1614
00:52:22,660 --> 00:52:24,260
- I did it gently.
- How did she remove one layer?

1615
00:52:24,260 --> 00:52:25,430
I did it really gently.

1616
00:52:25,430 --> 00:52:26,660
- Yoo Jung.
- All right.

1617
00:52:26,660 --> 00:52:28,360
Let's go.

1618
00:52:28,630 --> 00:52:29,800
This is fun.

1619
00:52:31,200 --> 00:52:32,300
This is fun.

1620
00:52:32,300 --> 00:52:33,740
(She succeeded to remove one layer.)

1621
00:52:33,740 --> 00:52:34,970
Good job.

1622
00:52:34,970 --> 00:52:36,240
(She is surprised.)

1623
00:52:36,740 --> 00:52:38,410
(Jae Suk makes a big fuss.)

1624
00:52:38,410 --> 00:52:40,470
It was so nerve-wracking.

1625
00:52:40,470 --> 00:52:41,470
(Captain Yoo Jung
succeeded courageously.)

1626
00:52:41,470 --> 00:52:42,720
Good job.

1627
00:52:42,820 --> 00:52:45,820
The second team should pick someone
who will answer the question.

1628
00:52:45,820 --> 00:52:47,320
- Let's keep it simple.
- Se Chan.

1629
00:52:47,320 --> 00:52:48,550
- Let's keep it simple.
- Okay.

1630
00:52:48,550 --> 00:52:49,610
If it's about ugliness,
the answer is Kwang Soo.

1631
00:52:49,610 --> 00:52:50,630
That goes without saying.

1632
00:52:50,720 --> 00:52:52,630
- Se Chan.
- Watch me.

1633
00:52:52,630 --> 00:52:55,760
I will be able to guess the question
once I hear the name.

1634
00:52:55,760 --> 00:52:57,130
- That's right.
- Let's go.

1635
00:52:57,660 --> 00:52:58,860
I will figure it out right away.
Who is it?

1636
00:52:58,860 --> 00:53:00,160
Hold on.

1637
00:53:00,160 --> 00:53:01,740
- Let's hear it.
- The question must be vague.

1638
00:53:01,740 --> 00:53:03,470
- Sit here.
- Keep it simple.

1639
00:53:03,470 --> 00:53:05,430
- No one fits it perfectly.
- That's right.

1640
00:53:05,430 --> 00:53:07,300
- Don't lie.
- I won't.

1641
00:53:07,300 --> 00:53:08,780
- I will figure it out right away.
- Let's go.

1642
00:53:08,780 --> 00:53:10,150
(After much deliberation,
he chooses...)

1643
00:53:10,150 --> 00:53:13,680
- Sunhwa.
- Me?

1644
00:53:13,680 --> 00:53:15,450
- This is hard. Sunhwa?
- Sunhwa?

1645
00:53:15,450 --> 00:53:17,680
- I...
- Let me answer.

1646
00:53:17,680 --> 00:53:19,990
The person who can lie the best.

1647
00:53:20,090 --> 00:53:22,090
Let me answer.
The person who is a scatterbrain.

1648
00:53:22,090 --> 00:53:23,550
(Incorrect)

1649
00:53:23,680 --> 00:53:25,050
Let me answer.
The person who is ignorant.

1650
00:53:25,550 --> 00:53:27,800
That was forever ago.

1651
00:53:28,700 --> 00:53:30,200
- I don't watch TV.
- You are stuck in the past.

1652
00:53:30,300 --> 00:53:32,430
Let me answer.
The person who has never dated.

1653
00:53:32,430 --> 00:53:33,590
- What?
- Sunhwa?

1654
00:53:33,590 --> 00:53:37,110
- I have dated a few men. My gosh.
- Is it a compliment or what?

1655
00:53:37,110 --> 00:53:39,860
Please reveal the top 2 and 3
as a hint.

1656
00:53:39,860 --> 00:53:41,970
- The top 2 and 3?
- Okay, that will help.

1657
00:53:42,510 --> 00:53:44,340
- I will get it right.
- This is hard.

1658
00:53:44,340 --> 00:53:46,880
- Then I choose Yoo Jung.
- If he mentions Chang Wook...

1659
00:53:46,880 --> 00:53:48,110
Yoo Jung?

1660
00:53:48,110 --> 00:53:49,610
And Chang Wook.

1661
00:53:50,220 --> 00:53:52,090
I see that sex doesn't matter.

1662
00:53:52,090 --> 00:53:53,510
It's related to our job.

1663
00:53:53,510 --> 00:53:55,410
- Our job?
- Yes.

1664
00:53:55,410 --> 00:53:56,680
Let me answer.

1665
00:53:57,930 --> 00:54:02,090
- If Se Chan were to meet someone...
- That's right.

1666
00:54:02,090 --> 00:54:03,900
- It's too long.
- in the industry...

1667
00:54:04,130 --> 00:54:05,720
Is that your guess?

1668
00:54:05,720 --> 00:54:07,630
- If Se Chan were to meet someone...
- What are you talking about?

1669
00:54:07,630 --> 00:54:09,090
That's not how you play this game.

1670
00:54:09,090 --> 00:54:10,240
- Is it incorrect?
- It's incorrect.

1671
00:54:10,240 --> 00:54:11,300
Let me answer.

1672
00:54:11,300 --> 00:54:13,130
The person who is the worst
at investing.

1673
00:54:13,200 --> 00:54:14,380
Let me answer.

1674
00:54:14,570 --> 00:54:17,840
Being a celebrity,
we have many worries and...

1675
00:54:17,840 --> 00:54:19,150
What are you doing?

1676
00:54:19,150 --> 00:54:21,240
- What are you doing?
- That's ridiculous.

1677
00:54:21,240 --> 00:54:23,240
- What did I do wrong?
- Your answer is too long.

1678
00:54:23,240 --> 00:54:24,950
- It wasn't too long.
- Let me answer.

1679
00:54:25,090 --> 00:54:28,160
The person who has given
the most amount of autographs.

1680
00:54:28,160 --> 00:54:29,450
- No, that's not it.
- Let me answer.

1681
00:54:30,180 --> 00:54:33,130
When you are
in the entertainment industry,

1682
00:54:33,130 --> 00:54:35,450
you come across people
who haven't...

1683
00:54:35,550 --> 00:54:37,130
- Hurry up and answer.
- What are you doing?

1684
00:54:37,130 --> 00:54:38,430
Are you a doctor?

1685
00:54:39,160 --> 00:54:40,800
Can't I guess?

1686
00:54:40,800 --> 00:54:42,700
- It was ridiculous.
- Can't I guess?

1687
00:54:42,700 --> 00:54:44,160
For goodness' sake.

1688
00:54:44,160 --> 00:54:45,160
Give us a hint.

1689
00:54:45,160 --> 00:54:46,800
- Would you like a motion hint?
- Yes.

1690
00:54:47,740 --> 00:54:48,780
(Rubbing his eyes)

1691
00:54:48,780 --> 00:54:50,010
Let me answer!

1692
00:54:50,680 --> 00:54:52,240
(Confident)

1693
00:54:52,240 --> 00:54:53,950
- I haven't done anything yet.
- The person with bad sight...

1694
00:54:53,950 --> 00:54:55,880
- Incorrect. Let me keep going.
- It's incorrect.

1695
00:54:55,880 --> 00:54:57,680
- I am not done yet.
- He hasn't given a hint yet.

1696
00:54:57,680 --> 00:54:59,680
- I will keep it simple.
- Don't show unnecessary motions.

1697
00:54:59,680 --> 00:55:01,280
I got confused because you did this.

1698
00:55:01,280 --> 00:55:03,490
- I wanted to bring out the detail.
- Why did you rub your eyes?

1699
00:55:03,490 --> 00:55:04,590
I wanted to bring out the detail.

1700
00:55:04,590 --> 00:55:07,160
- Why did you rub your eyes?
- I will keep it straightforward.

1701
00:55:09,530 --> 00:55:10,970
- Let me answer!
- Let me answer!

1702
00:55:11,700 --> 00:55:12,930
- Let me answer!
- Sunhwa was faster.

1703
00:55:12,930 --> 00:55:13,990
I was faster.

1704
00:55:13,990 --> 00:55:15,030
She was faster.

1705
00:55:15,030 --> 00:55:17,910
The person who looks up
his or her name the most.

1706
00:55:17,910 --> 00:55:19,010
That's it!

1707
00:55:19,010 --> 00:55:20,800
(Correct)

1708
00:55:21,530 --> 00:55:24,780
I rubbed my eyes to express
doing so on a search engine.

1709
00:55:25,380 --> 00:55:26,880
- Good job.
- So that was the answer.

1710
00:55:27,470 --> 00:55:28,720
I did think of that.

1711
00:55:28,720 --> 00:55:30,220
Then why did you sit still?

1712
00:55:30,220 --> 00:55:31,840
I said "Let me answer" too late.

1713
00:55:32,380 --> 00:55:33,910
Team Sang Woo, go first.

1714
00:55:33,910 --> 00:55:36,450
Team Chang Wook, you are out
if you pop this balloon.

1715
00:55:36,720 --> 00:55:38,030
What? Out?

1716
00:55:38,030 --> 00:55:39,380
We only get two balloons.

1717
00:55:39,380 --> 00:55:40,720
You will do well.

1718
00:55:40,720 --> 00:55:41,950
Sang Woo will do it.

1719
00:55:42,050 --> 00:55:44,030
Do it gently. Relax your wrist.

1720
00:55:44,130 --> 00:55:45,430
Just put the blade on the surface.

1721
00:55:45,430 --> 00:55:47,160
- It will pop if you push.
- Pop.

1722
00:55:47,430 --> 00:55:48,840
Pop. Pop.

1723
00:55:48,930 --> 00:55:50,260
- Just put the blade on the surface.
- Yes.

1724
00:55:50,260 --> 00:55:51,340
Gently.

1725
00:55:51,340 --> 00:55:53,030
- Why isn't it working?
- Scratch it.

1726
00:55:53,030 --> 00:55:54,410
- No.
- Scratch it.

1727
00:55:54,410 --> 00:55:56,340
- It isn't...
- There you go.

1728
00:55:57,410 --> 00:55:59,150
(He succeeds to slash 2 layers.)

1729
00:56:00,780 --> 00:56:03,490
- Two layers.
- My goodness.

1730
00:56:04,050 --> 00:56:05,590
How many layers did you slash?

1731
00:56:05,590 --> 00:56:06,720
Two layers? That's a lot.

1732
00:56:06,720 --> 00:56:08,090
- Team Yoo Jung.
- Shall we go first?

1733
00:56:08,160 --> 00:56:09,380
Yoo Jung.

1734
00:56:09,380 --> 00:56:10,880
- Yoo Jung, we believe in you.
- She is...

1735
00:56:10,880 --> 00:56:12,280
a professional.

1736
00:56:12,280 --> 00:56:14,200
Come closer. If it pops,
we should get wet together.

1737
00:56:14,200 --> 00:56:15,220
That's right.

1738
00:56:15,220 --> 00:56:17,070
Suk Jin, move your head.

1739
00:56:17,220 --> 00:56:18,800
Yoo Jung, we believe in you.

1740
00:56:18,990 --> 00:56:21,260
- Yoo Jung, please.
- You can do it.

1741
00:56:21,260 --> 00:56:22,470
- Do it gently.
- Come on.

1742
00:56:22,470 --> 00:56:24,340
- Yoo Jung, do it gently.
- There you go.

1743
00:56:24,340 --> 00:56:25,340
- There you go.
- Gently.

1744
00:56:25,340 --> 00:56:26,530
- It's in.
- That's enough.

1745
00:56:26,530 --> 00:56:28,780
- My goodness.
- You are practically slicing it.

1746
00:56:29,340 --> 00:56:31,200
- Hold on.
- For goodness' sake.

1747
00:56:31,200 --> 00:56:33,280
Yoo Jung, you need to ignore them
and do it.

1748
00:56:33,280 --> 00:56:34,910
- I am sorry.
- Just do it.

1749
00:56:34,910 --> 00:56:36,450
- I am sorry.
- I can't concentrate.

1750
00:56:36,450 --> 00:56:38,150
I couldn't help but talk.

1751
00:56:38,150 --> 00:56:40,820
- We will keep quiet.
- Okay, okay.

1752
00:56:40,820 --> 00:56:42,320
The balloon doesn't pop easily.

1753
00:56:42,760 --> 00:56:45,380
- That's right.
- Don't listen to them.

1754
00:56:48,130 --> 00:56:51,260
(She manages to slash one layer
this time as well.)

1755
00:56:51,260 --> 00:56:52,300
Yoo Jung.

1756
00:56:52,360 --> 00:56:53,630
How are you so good at it?

1757
00:56:53,630 --> 00:56:55,530
You are a genius.

1758
00:56:55,530 --> 00:56:57,340
It peeled off so fast.

1759
00:56:57,340 --> 00:56:58,840
If you pop this balloon,
you are out.

1760
00:56:58,840 --> 00:56:59,930
All right.

1761
00:56:59,930 --> 00:57:01,800
Do it gently. Do it gently.

1762
00:57:01,910 --> 00:57:03,550
- Do it gently.
- Gently.

1763
00:57:03,550 --> 00:57:05,200
(Gently)

1764
00:57:05,200 --> 00:57:06,200
Rub it back and forth.

1765
00:57:06,200 --> 00:57:07,950
No. Keep it on the same spot.

1766
00:57:08,280 --> 00:57:09,320
Hold on.

1767
00:57:10,240 --> 00:57:12,180
- I am sorry.
- You keep blowing air...

1768
00:57:12,180 --> 00:57:13,220
into my ear.

1769
00:57:13,220 --> 00:57:14,360
I am sorry.

1770
00:57:14,360 --> 00:57:15,860
Stop blowing air into his ear.

1771
00:57:15,860 --> 00:57:17,220
Why would you blow air into his ear?

1772
00:57:17,380 --> 00:57:18,550
Do it gently.

1773
00:57:18,550 --> 00:57:20,160
(He covers his ear.)

1774
00:57:20,530 --> 00:57:21,720
- Gently.
- Keep it on the same spot.

1775
00:57:21,720 --> 00:57:23,200
- It pops very easily.
- Hit it lightly.

1776
00:57:23,200 --> 00:57:24,400
- Hit it lightly.
- There are 10 layers, so it's okay.

1777
00:57:24,400 --> 00:57:27,090
- Hit it lightly.
- No, no. Don't listen to him.

1778
00:57:27,090 --> 00:57:28,630
(Hitting)

1779
00:57:28,760 --> 00:57:29,900
- Don't listen to him.
- Seriously.

1780
00:57:29,900 --> 00:57:31,740
- How could you listen to him?
- Keep your ears closed.

1781
00:57:31,740 --> 00:57:32,910
Don't listen to anyone.

1782
00:57:32,910 --> 00:57:34,340
Do what you want to do.

1783
00:57:34,340 --> 00:57:36,240
- Just keep your touch gentle.
- Let's focus.

1784
00:57:36,430 --> 00:57:37,680
He will do it now.

1785
00:57:38,240 --> 00:57:39,240
Chang Wook.

1786
00:57:39,800 --> 00:57:40,840
Hey, that's...

1787
00:57:41,450 --> 00:57:42,470
(Shaking)

1788
00:57:42,470 --> 00:57:43,470
- There you go.
- Hit it lightly.

1789
00:57:43,470 --> 00:57:44,550
- Hey, hey!
- Hold on!

1790
00:57:44,550 --> 00:57:45,550
- There you go.
- Hit it lightly.

1791
00:57:45,550 --> 00:57:47,380
- Hey, hey!
- Hold on!

1792
00:57:47,380 --> 00:57:48,760
- I can't do it.
- You should do it.

1793
00:57:48,760 --> 00:57:50,860
- Do it gently.
- Do it as if trimming your brows.

1794
00:57:50,860 --> 00:57:52,220
It's almost done.

1795
00:57:52,220 --> 00:57:53,930
- Okay. I got it.
- Give it a try.

1796
00:57:53,990 --> 00:57:55,820
Do it gently.

1797
00:57:55,820 --> 00:57:57,200
- Do you want me to do it?
- This is our last chance.

1798
00:57:57,200 --> 00:57:59,070
- Hold on.
- Don't hit it.

1799
00:57:59,070 --> 00:58:00,130
That tactic won't work.

1800
00:58:00,340 --> 00:58:01,340
Jae Suk...

1801
00:58:02,360 --> 00:58:03,360
(Popping)

1802
00:58:04,260 --> 00:58:06,010
(They get a splash of water.)

1803
00:58:07,200 --> 00:58:09,200
(She failed to control
her strength.)

1804
00:58:10,450 --> 00:58:11,450
My goodness.

1805
00:58:11,450 --> 00:58:13,070
That happened
because you kept scratching.

1806
00:58:13,070 --> 00:58:14,950
Okay!

1807
00:58:14,950 --> 00:58:15,970
I am so annoyed.

1808
00:58:15,970 --> 00:58:17,340
- They did the worst job.
- Okay.

1809
00:58:17,340 --> 00:58:19,720
You shouldn't have scratched
the surface.

1810
00:58:19,720 --> 00:58:21,760
Other teams removed 1 or 2 layers.

1811
00:58:21,760 --> 00:58:23,950
You are in no place to say that.

1812
00:58:23,950 --> 00:58:25,630
I told you to do it gently.

1813
00:58:25,630 --> 00:58:27,820
I couldn't keep my touch gentle
since I was too annoyed.

1814
00:58:27,820 --> 00:58:29,530
They are terrible at it.

1815
00:58:30,360 --> 00:58:32,200
- Okay.
- Team Chang Wook is the last place.

1816
00:58:32,200 --> 00:58:33,570
They are out.

1817
00:58:34,340 --> 00:58:36,160
You can still answer the question.

1818
00:58:36,160 --> 00:58:37,610
Shall I give a question?

1819
00:58:38,070 --> 00:58:39,530
Can we get the answer right?

1820
00:58:39,530 --> 00:58:40,570
No.

1821
00:58:40,910 --> 00:58:42,130
Just enjoy the game.

1822
00:58:42,130 --> 00:58:43,650
- What?
- Just enjoy Running Man.

1823
00:58:43,650 --> 00:58:44,740
Are we only allowed to give
the question?

1824
00:58:44,740 --> 00:58:46,550
Yes. Give them your answer.

1825
00:58:46,550 --> 00:58:47,610
Who is it?

1826
00:58:47,740 --> 00:58:49,180
You can sit down and do it.

1827
00:58:49,180 --> 00:58:50,380
I bet he will give a strange answer
on purpose.

1828
00:58:50,380 --> 00:58:51,380
- Who is it?
- I bet he will throw us off.

1829
00:58:51,380 --> 00:58:53,320
It's what I think.

1830
00:58:53,760 --> 00:58:56,010
- I am going by the person's image.
- Hurry up.

1831
00:58:56,910 --> 00:58:57,950
- Sunhwa.
- Why?

1832
00:58:57,950 --> 00:58:59,660
- Sunhwa?
- Her image?

1833
00:58:59,660 --> 00:59:01,720
- What is this about?
- Let's hear more about it.

1834
00:59:01,720 --> 00:59:02,990
- What is this about?
- Sunhwa.

1835
00:59:02,990 --> 00:59:04,900
It's about dating.

1836
00:59:04,900 --> 00:59:06,030
- Dating?
- It's about dating.

1837
00:59:06,030 --> 00:59:07,360
- Dating?
- It's about dating, right?

1838
00:59:07,360 --> 00:59:08,740
- Dating.
- Let me answer.

1839
00:59:08,740 --> 00:59:10,570
The person who would break up
in the coolest fashion.

1840
00:59:10,800 --> 00:59:12,160
No. I am not cool about a breakup.

1841
00:59:12,160 --> 00:59:13,430
Is it about two-timing?

1842
00:59:13,610 --> 00:59:15,240
The person who gets obsessive...

1843
00:59:15,240 --> 00:59:17,550
- Is it about dating?
- Is it a good thing or a bad thing?

1844
00:59:17,550 --> 00:59:20,340
Well, it's not a good thing.

1845
00:59:20,340 --> 00:59:21,970
- Really?
- Is it about a breakup?

1846
00:59:22,010 --> 00:59:23,150
Is it about a breakup?

1847
00:59:23,450 --> 00:59:24,840
A breakup.

1848
00:59:25,010 --> 00:59:26,280
It's related to a breakup.

1849
00:59:26,380 --> 00:59:27,990
- Really?
- Let me answer.

1850
00:59:27,990 --> 00:59:29,660
The person who would break up
the fastest.

1851
00:59:29,660 --> 00:59:32,260
I am sorry, but this could be
a bit worse than that.

1852
00:59:32,490 --> 00:59:34,720
- Is it worse than that?
- Then why did you give my name?

1853
00:59:34,720 --> 00:59:36,530
It's not something that comes
after a breakup.

1854
00:59:36,530 --> 00:59:38,590
- I see.
- Then during a relationship...

1855
00:59:39,030 --> 00:59:40,530
Who is the top two?

1856
00:59:40,530 --> 00:59:41,530
Is it So Min?

1857
00:59:41,740 --> 00:59:43,360
Why would it be me?
He said it's something bad.

1858
00:59:43,360 --> 00:59:45,200
- We are the same.
- That's exactly why it's you.

1859
00:59:45,200 --> 00:59:46,910
Why do people choose me
for all the bad things?

1860
00:59:46,910 --> 00:59:48,240
You are a bit...

1861
00:59:48,280 --> 00:59:49,930
So Min is within the top three,
right?

1862
00:59:50,010 --> 00:59:51,200
The top two is...

1863
00:59:51,450 --> 00:59:53,470
- Haha.
- What?

1864
00:59:53,470 --> 00:59:55,150
(Am I the top 2?)

1865
00:59:55,150 --> 00:59:56,450
- Really?
- Let me answer.

1866
00:59:56,650 --> 00:59:58,840
The person who swears
when he or she breaks up.

1867
00:59:58,840 --> 01:00:00,450
It's not something that comes
after a breakup.

1868
01:00:00,450 --> 01:00:02,360
- That's right.
- He said that before.

1869
01:00:02,360 --> 01:00:04,720
This is something that comes
during a breakup.

1870
01:00:04,720 --> 01:00:06,720
The person who doesn't pay
for the date.

1871
01:00:06,720 --> 01:00:08,320
- I pay a lot.
- I...

1872
01:00:08,320 --> 01:00:09,590
I practically sell the house.

1873
01:00:09,590 --> 01:00:11,320
I can't help but explain myself.

1874
01:00:11,320 --> 01:00:12,530
- "I am not like that."
- It's about...

1875
01:00:12,530 --> 01:00:13,800
dating someone...

1876
01:00:13,800 --> 01:00:15,240
(That's what it says
on the cue card.)

1877
01:00:15,240 --> 01:00:17,610
There is a word, "The other".

1878
01:00:17,610 --> 01:00:18,970
(It's a big hint.)

1879
01:00:19,970 --> 01:00:21,110
- The other?
- Yes.

1880
01:00:21,110 --> 01:00:22,130
Let me answer.

1881
01:00:22,380 --> 01:00:25,610
The person the other would tire of
the fastest in a relationship.

1882
01:00:25,970 --> 01:00:27,840
(Correct)

1883
01:00:27,840 --> 01:00:29,110
Come on!

1884
01:00:29,110 --> 01:00:30,490
Why is it Sunhwa?

1885
01:00:30,490 --> 01:00:31,550
Why is it me?

1886
01:00:31,550 --> 01:00:32,550
- Explain.
- Why is it Sunhwa?

1887
01:00:32,550 --> 01:00:34,160
- I mean...
- How could you do this to me?

1888
01:00:34,160 --> 01:00:35,860
- It's not like that.
- Come here!

1889
01:00:35,860 --> 01:00:37,220
Take this!

1890
01:00:37,220 --> 01:00:39,160
- Why is it Sunhwa?
- I had to pick someone.

1891
01:00:39,160 --> 01:00:40,450
I'm not saying you're like that.

1892
01:00:40,450 --> 01:00:42,360
What do you know about Sunhwa?

1893
01:00:42,360 --> 01:00:44,260
I am already hurt
because of my past relationship.

1894
01:00:44,260 --> 01:00:45,320
Seriously.

1895
01:00:45,320 --> 01:00:46,570
Don't misunderstand.

1896
01:00:46,590 --> 01:00:47,800
How could you be so mean?

1897
01:00:47,800 --> 01:00:48,800
- I had to choose someone.
- My relationships...

1898
01:00:48,800 --> 01:00:50,510
- last long.
- Is Haha the top two?

1899
01:00:50,530 --> 01:00:51,740
Why am I the top two? Explain.

1900
01:00:51,740 --> 01:00:52,800
- My relationships last long.
- It's...

1901
01:00:52,800 --> 01:00:53,930
What do you know?

1902
01:00:54,030 --> 01:00:55,070
What do you know?

1903
01:00:55,070 --> 01:00:56,380
My ex-girlfriends
still have feelings for me!

1904
01:00:56,380 --> 01:00:58,910
The celebrities you have dated
always say...

1905
01:00:58,910 --> 01:01:00,550
they are sick and tired of you!

1906
01:01:00,550 --> 01:01:02,610
- Look at yourself objectively.
- I know that, but...

1907
01:01:02,610 --> 01:01:03,740
I just went with my feeling.

1908
01:01:03,740 --> 01:01:05,950
I got confused
because he picked Sunhwa.

1909
01:01:05,950 --> 01:01:07,660
No one would have thought that
about her.

1910
01:01:07,720 --> 01:01:09,720
Seriously.
My relationships last long.

1911
01:01:09,720 --> 01:01:12,320
I know that. I am sorry.
I had to pick someone.

1912
01:01:12,320 --> 01:01:14,820
The two teams will take turns
to slash the balloon.

1913
01:01:14,820 --> 01:01:18,200
I don't know why
we need to sit down and do it.

1914
01:01:18,200 --> 01:01:19,720
No, no. It's a rule.

1915
01:01:19,720 --> 01:01:20,990
- All right.
- We need to sit down.

1916
01:01:20,990 --> 01:01:22,430
I will sit down.

1917
01:01:22,430 --> 01:01:24,200
- I hope their balloon pops.
- We need to do it, right?

1918
01:01:24,340 --> 01:01:25,740
It's so frustrating.

1919
01:01:25,740 --> 01:01:27,200
No, no. Hold on.

1920
01:01:27,200 --> 01:01:28,280
What?

1921
01:01:28,280 --> 01:01:29,700
Move the blade sideways.

1922
01:01:29,700 --> 01:01:31,450
- That's right.
- Move the blade sideways.

1923
01:01:33,300 --> 01:01:34,320
Move it sideways.

1924
01:01:36,740 --> 01:01:39,720
(She removed 4 layers.)

1925
01:01:40,450 --> 01:01:41,610
(In any case, she succeeded.)

1926
01:01:41,610 --> 01:01:43,360
- Did you see that?
- Good job.

1927
01:01:43,450 --> 01:01:44,720
You did a good job.

1928
01:01:44,860 --> 01:01:46,320
This is how you do it.

1929
01:01:46,320 --> 01:01:47,360
I will stay close.

1930
01:01:50,930 --> 01:01:52,470
(Bursting)

1931
01:01:53,760 --> 01:01:55,630
(She took out her anger
on the water balloon.)

1932
01:01:55,930 --> 01:01:57,660
The water splattered everywhere!

1933
01:01:58,530 --> 01:01:59,910
(Sunhwa slashed
without holding back.)

1934
01:01:59,910 --> 01:02:01,430
- You...
- I did it gently!

1935
01:02:01,430 --> 01:02:02,840
She is angry because of you!

1936
01:02:02,840 --> 01:02:04,450
- I am sorry, Sunhwa.
- She is really angry.

1937
01:02:04,450 --> 01:02:07,280
I picked you
because I had to pick someone.

1938
01:02:07,650 --> 01:02:09,380
- Come back to your senses.
- I could have done...

1939
01:02:09,380 --> 01:02:10,840
- better.
- Okay.

1940
01:02:10,950 --> 01:02:12,950
- Come back to your senses.
- Sunhwa, let's go.

1941
01:02:13,180 --> 01:02:15,450
Someone from Team Chang Wook.

1942
01:02:15,450 --> 01:02:16,760
Give us the name.

1943
01:02:16,760 --> 01:02:17,860
(Chang Wook checks the question
this time.)

1944
01:02:17,860 --> 01:02:19,880
- Whom will you choose?
- Well...

1945
01:02:20,700 --> 01:02:22,530
- Why is he looking at me?
- Whom will you choose?

1946
01:02:22,900 --> 01:02:24,590
- Suk Jin.
- Me?

1947
01:02:24,590 --> 01:02:26,720
Let me answer. The person
who doesn't act his or her age.

1948
01:02:27,070 --> 01:02:28,130
(Incorrect)

1949
01:02:28,130 --> 01:02:29,630
- Me?
- The person who is cold-hearted.

1950
01:02:29,630 --> 01:02:32,800
The person who frequents the toilet
at night because of residual urine.

1951
01:02:32,800 --> 01:02:34,740
Don't say something that's true.

1952
01:02:35,280 --> 01:02:36,630
Don't say something that's true.

1953
01:02:36,630 --> 01:02:37,840
- Residual urine!
- He frequents the toilet at night.

1954
01:02:37,840 --> 01:02:38,880
Residual urine!

1955
01:02:39,340 --> 01:02:42,150
Let me answer.
The person who says he peed...

1956
01:02:42,180 --> 01:02:43,740
even though you didn't hear
any sound.

1957
01:02:43,950 --> 01:02:45,050
(Incorrect)

1958
01:02:45,050 --> 01:02:46,840
There was no one else.

1959
01:02:46,840 --> 01:02:48,860
(The silent toilet)

1960
01:02:48,860 --> 01:02:50,860
Chang Wook must see Suk Jin
differently from us.

1961
01:02:50,860 --> 01:02:52,860
- That's right.
- Chang Wook, tell us...

1962
01:02:52,860 --> 01:02:54,720
how you see Suk Jin.

1963
01:02:54,820 --> 01:02:56,900
Since he has a way with words,

1964
01:02:56,900 --> 01:02:58,530
- Really?
- I think...

1965
01:02:58,530 --> 01:03:00,030
he will do this
when he has a conversation.

1966
01:03:00,030 --> 01:03:01,090
A conversation?

1967
01:03:01,090 --> 01:03:02,160
Let me answer.

1968
01:03:02,260 --> 01:03:04,070
The person who laughs
at his own joke.

1969
01:03:04,610 --> 01:03:07,160
That was perfect.

1970
01:03:07,530 --> 01:03:11,180
Let me answer. The person
who isn't serious at all.

1971
01:03:11,340 --> 01:03:12,550
(Incorrect)

1972
01:03:12,550 --> 01:03:15,840
The person who has been punched
during a conversation.

1973
01:03:15,840 --> 01:03:16,840
(The person who has been punched
during a conversation)

1974
01:03:17,180 --> 01:03:18,740
That's correct.

1975
01:03:19,050 --> 01:03:21,260
That's perfect.

1976
01:03:21,260 --> 01:03:23,410
Chang Wook, give us a motion hint.

1977
01:03:24,030 --> 01:03:27,180
During a conversation, he would go,
"Hey, I..."

1978
01:03:27,990 --> 01:03:29,090
Let me answer.

1979
01:03:29,800 --> 01:03:31,630
(Upon seeing the motion hint,)

1980
01:03:31,630 --> 01:03:32,720
(Jae Suk yelled out.)

1981
01:03:32,720 --> 01:03:35,340
The person who brags about
the celebrities...

1982
01:03:35,340 --> 01:03:36,400
- he knows.
- Let me answer.

1983
01:03:36,590 --> 01:03:37,630
(Correct)

1984
01:03:37,630 --> 01:03:40,200
(Who would brag about
the celebrities he or she knows?)

1985
01:03:40,200 --> 01:03:41,280
My goodness.

1986
01:03:41,280 --> 01:03:44,010
Brag about how well-connected I am?
I don't do that.

1987
01:03:44,010 --> 01:03:45,010
- Chang Wook.
- But...

1988
01:03:45,010 --> 01:03:47,650
you bragged too much earlier.

1989
01:03:47,650 --> 01:03:48,650
Chang Wook.

1990
01:03:48,650 --> 01:03:50,650
You started
from Magistrate Byun and...

1991
01:03:50,650 --> 01:03:52,650
- He did that.
- Magistrate Byun.

1992
01:03:52,650 --> 01:03:54,360
- I am sorry.
- The former classmates.

1993
01:03:54,360 --> 01:03:55,820
I bragged too much earlier.

1994
01:03:55,820 --> 01:03:57,160
That's right.

1995
01:03:57,160 --> 01:03:58,280
- That's right.
- Okay.

1996
01:03:58,280 --> 01:03:59,780
Slash the balloon.

1997
01:03:59,860 --> 01:04:00,950
So Min, do it.

1998
01:04:00,950 --> 01:04:02,530
- Should I do it?
- She is Dr. Romantic.

1999
01:04:02,530 --> 01:04:04,360
I don't know if I would be able
to do it again.

2000
01:04:04,430 --> 01:04:05,760
She is Dr. Jeon.

2001
01:04:06,530 --> 01:04:07,570
Dr. Jeon, I believe in you.

2002
01:04:07,740 --> 01:04:08,990
It's over for them.

2003
01:04:09,590 --> 01:04:11,340
- Dr. Jeon.
- It's okay if I fail, right?

2004
01:04:11,340 --> 01:04:13,800
Dr. Jeon, it's okay. Go ahead.

2005
01:04:13,800 --> 01:04:16,380
(She brandishes the scalpel.)

2006
01:04:16,380 --> 01:04:17,740
What was that?

2007
01:04:17,740 --> 01:04:18,740
- What?
- What was that?

2008
01:04:18,740 --> 01:04:20,010
- It fell.
- It's on the floor.

2009
01:04:20,150 --> 01:04:21,450
- What happened?
- We are still in.

2010
01:04:21,450 --> 01:04:22,740
We are still in.

2011
01:04:22,740 --> 01:04:23,820
- How did you do it?
- We are still in.

2012
01:04:23,820 --> 01:04:25,780
It looked like
a turtle was laying an egg.

2013
01:04:25,840 --> 01:04:27,220
So Min is good.

2014
01:04:27,220 --> 01:04:28,910
- She is daring.
- It didn't burst.

2015
01:04:28,910 --> 01:04:31,490
I will try again, but there is
a good chance it will burst.

2016
01:04:31,490 --> 01:04:33,780
I bet Kwang Soo will burst it
with his hands.

2017
01:04:33,780 --> 01:04:35,050
I wouldn't do that.
Don't be ridiculous.

2018
01:04:35,050 --> 01:04:36,130
- In that case,
- I am nervous.

2019
01:04:36,130 --> 01:04:37,700
cut his finger.

2020
01:04:37,700 --> 01:04:39,590
Come on. I will just hold it.

2021
01:04:39,590 --> 01:04:41,090
Keep your fingers relaxed.

2022
01:04:41,090 --> 01:04:43,340
- Okay.
- Let's do it.

2023
01:04:43,340 --> 01:04:45,240
- Don't press it!
- All right.

2024
01:04:45,240 --> 01:04:46,630
All right. I will just hold it.

2025
01:04:46,630 --> 01:04:48,430
I am simply applying force.

2026
01:04:48,430 --> 01:04:50,530
- Why would you do that?
- Action and reaction.

2027
01:04:50,610 --> 01:04:51,610
I will stay still.

2028
01:04:51,650 --> 01:04:53,800
Why did you bring up
action and reaction?

2029
01:04:53,800 --> 01:04:54,950
(Why did he bring up
action and reaction?)

2030
01:04:54,950 --> 01:04:56,380
Be careful.

2031
01:04:56,510 --> 01:05:00,820
(Will So Min be able to succeed?)

2032
01:05:03,180 --> 01:05:04,180
I did it.

2033
01:05:04,720 --> 01:05:07,430
(But...)

2034
01:05:07,430 --> 01:05:09,930
(Kwang Soo's action
and reaction came into play.)

2035
01:05:10,200 --> 01:05:12,070
- What was that?
- It didn't burst!

2036
01:05:12,070 --> 01:05:13,720
- I did it.
- It was Kwang Soo.

2037
01:05:13,720 --> 01:05:14,740
Kwang Soo pressed it.

2038
01:05:14,740 --> 01:05:17,030
He got water all over him.

2039
01:05:17,030 --> 01:05:19,610
- He is stupid.
- So Min succeeded.

2040
01:05:19,800 --> 01:05:20,930
Are you okay?

2041
01:05:20,930 --> 01:05:22,800
- So Min succeeded.
- I succeeded.

2042
01:05:22,800 --> 01:05:24,380
- Team Yoo Jung takes first place.
- Okay.

2043
01:05:24,380 --> 01:05:26,700
Yoo Jung, you did it.

2044
01:05:26,700 --> 01:05:28,610
Yoo Jung made all the difference.

2045
01:05:30,220 --> 01:05:31,990
Starting from the winning team,

2046
01:05:31,990 --> 01:05:33,650
you will choose an item each.

2047
01:05:33,650 --> 01:05:35,050
Yoo Jung, let's go.

2048
01:05:35,050 --> 01:05:36,610
A packed meal.

2049
01:05:36,610 --> 01:05:38,220
A packed meal is popular.

2050
01:05:38,220 --> 01:05:39,220
All right.

2051
01:05:39,220 --> 01:05:40,530
- Pick an item, Sang Woo.
- Wet wipes.

2052
01:05:40,530 --> 01:05:41,530
Okay.

2053
01:05:44,820 --> 01:05:46,700
- Okay.
- A hangover drink.

2054
01:05:46,700 --> 01:05:48,360
We choose an energy drink.

2055
01:05:48,530 --> 01:05:49,900
- Okay.
- That can't be popular.

2056
01:05:49,900 --> 01:05:52,470
You have an offer from a broker.

2057
01:05:52,470 --> 01:05:54,240
- What is it?
- Team Sunhwa,

2058
01:05:55,010 --> 01:05:56,180
will you accept it?

2059
01:05:56,380 --> 01:05:57,550
- What should we do?
- Let's turn it down.

2060
01:05:57,550 --> 01:05:59,070
- Turn it down.
- What happens if we turn it down?

2061
01:05:59,070 --> 01:06:00,240
- We receive a hint.
- What happens if we accept it?

2062
01:06:00,240 --> 01:06:01,340
- Then we can catch the brokers.
- A hint?

2063
01:06:01,340 --> 01:06:02,610
- Two hints.
- Don't do that.

2064
01:06:02,610 --> 01:06:03,820
You are a broker, right?

2065
01:06:03,820 --> 01:06:05,050
- No, I am not.
- That's why...

2066
01:06:05,050 --> 01:06:06,110
We aren't brokers,

2067
01:06:06,110 --> 01:06:08,990
- so we want a hint.
- We won't be able to find them.

2068
01:06:08,990 --> 01:06:10,050
No, Haha.

2069
01:06:10,050 --> 01:06:11,220
- Don't be like that.
- Are you a broker?

2070
01:06:11,220 --> 01:06:13,260
- We need a hint.
- Everyone.

2071
01:06:13,260 --> 01:06:14,800
I will give you a crucial hint.

2072
01:06:15,130 --> 01:06:17,800
The top 1, 2, 3 items
in terms of sales are still here.

2073
01:06:17,800 --> 01:06:18,970
Really?

2074
01:06:18,970 --> 01:06:21,360
(The top 1, 2, 3 items
in terms of sales remain.)

2075
01:06:21,360 --> 01:06:22,360
Really?

2076
01:06:22,630 --> 01:06:24,740
- Then let's accept it.
- Let's accept it.

2077
01:06:25,160 --> 01:06:26,470
No way.

2078
01:06:27,880 --> 01:06:29,240
Could chewing gum be one of them?

2079
01:06:29,240 --> 01:06:30,430
- I don't think so.
- People don't buy it often.

2080
01:06:30,430 --> 01:06:32,300
I think they're around here.
I think they're drinks.

2081
01:06:32,300 --> 01:06:34,510
I think banana milk is
one of the top three.

2082
01:06:34,510 --> 01:06:36,380
- I agree.
- Banana milk, definitely.

2083
01:06:36,470 --> 01:06:37,510
- Let's go for it.
- Let's go for it.

2084
01:06:37,510 --> 01:06:39,340
- It's very popular.
- We've made our choice.

2085
01:06:40,490 --> 01:06:42,880
Guys, a broker
just proposed a deal...

2086
01:06:43,010 --> 01:06:44,660
to Team Yoo Jung.

2087
01:06:45,490 --> 01:06:47,030
- Make up your mind.
- We'll accept it.

2088
01:06:47,030 --> 01:06:48,220
- We'll accept it. Let's go.
- What?

2089
01:06:48,220 --> 01:06:49,660
- Why?
- We have to accept it.

2090
01:06:49,660 --> 01:06:51,160
- Why?
- Don't we need a hint?

2091
01:06:51,160 --> 01:06:53,490
- Isn't it better to get a hint?
- Do you want a hint?

2092
01:06:53,490 --> 01:06:54,930
- Let's get a hint.
- I think that'd be better.

2093
01:06:54,930 --> 01:06:56,300
Okay, let's get a hint. Yoo Jung.

2094
01:06:56,300 --> 01:06:57,800
What could be the top three?

2095
01:06:57,800 --> 01:06:59,570
Brokers, propose deals to us too.

2096
01:06:59,910 --> 01:07:01,800
Brokers, propose deals to us!

2097
01:07:01,880 --> 01:07:02,930
I have no idea.

2098
01:07:03,280 --> 01:07:04,470
What's that?

2099
01:07:04,470 --> 01:07:06,010
- Here's a hint.
- What?

2100
01:07:06,740 --> 01:07:08,610
- What's this?
- What's this?

2101
01:07:08,740 --> 01:07:09,780
(They receive a hint
from the staff.)

2102
01:07:09,780 --> 01:07:11,240
The broker wrote it.

2103
01:07:12,220 --> 01:07:14,360
- It's the broker's handwriting?
- The broker wrote it?

2104
01:07:14,360 --> 01:07:15,880
(It's the broker's handwriting?)

2105
01:07:15,880 --> 01:07:17,220
Is the handwriting the hint?

2106
01:07:17,320 --> 01:07:19,590
- Goodness, that's unbelievable.
- This...

2107
01:07:19,590 --> 01:07:21,860
- It's a label from clothes.
- It's a label from clothes.

2108
01:07:21,860 --> 01:07:24,400
Is it from the broker's clothes?

2109
01:07:24,530 --> 01:07:25,630
- Is this the same?
- This...

2110
01:07:26,030 --> 01:07:28,030
No, they're different.

2111
01:07:28,340 --> 01:07:30,490
Where is it from? Let me see.

2112
01:07:31,110 --> 01:07:32,740
- It's from a towel.
- It's from a towel?

2113
01:07:32,740 --> 01:07:33,930
A towel... Let me see.

2114
01:07:33,930 --> 01:07:35,510
- A towel...
- I know.

2115
01:07:35,700 --> 01:07:37,110
The broker is not among us.
Do you know why?

2116
01:07:37,110 --> 01:07:38,950
- We didn't use any towels.
- None of us are wet.

2117
01:07:39,550 --> 01:07:41,780
- The towel was the hint.
- When did the broker write it?

2118
01:07:43,050 --> 01:07:46,740
(The broker is
one of these nine people.)

2119
01:07:47,050 --> 01:07:48,590
I think there's a broker
among you guys.

2120
01:07:48,590 --> 01:07:50,010
Propose a deal to us,
and we'll accept it.

2121
01:07:50,180 --> 01:07:51,180
- Propose a deal.
- Let's propose a deal.

2122
01:07:51,180 --> 01:07:52,380
- Let's do it.
- Do it.

2123
01:07:52,380 --> 01:07:53,820
- Let's propose a deal.
- Please.

2124
01:07:53,930 --> 01:07:55,530
- Propose a deal to us too.
- We'll accept it.

2125
01:07:55,660 --> 01:07:57,220
- Do you want it first or...
- We'll accept it.

2126
01:07:57,320 --> 01:07:58,400
- We want it first.
- We'll accept it.

2127
01:07:58,400 --> 01:07:59,590
We'll propose a deal to this team.

2128
01:08:00,090 --> 01:08:01,130
You have to...

2129
01:08:01,130 --> 01:08:02,800
(Are these two really brokers?)

2130
01:08:03,900 --> 01:08:05,130
You have to signal the staff.

2131
01:08:05,130 --> 01:08:07,130
- It has to be done the proper way.
- We'll do it.

2132
01:08:07,970 --> 01:08:09,300
Start.

2133
01:08:09,700 --> 01:08:12,200
- We are the future
- We are the future

2134
01:08:12,200 --> 01:08:15,280
(We are the future)

2135
01:08:15,820 --> 01:08:18,110
(The two childish brokers
are proposing a deal.)

2136
01:08:18,110 --> 01:08:20,340
(What were we expecting from them?)

2137
01:08:20,450 --> 01:08:22,360
- That was the brokers' sign?
- Yes.

2138
01:08:23,160 --> 01:08:26,820
Why haven't I seen it before?

2139
01:08:28,260 --> 01:08:30,830
(The 40-year-old broker
is trying hard.)

2140
01:08:31,090 --> 01:08:32,500
Gather up, everyone.

2141
01:08:33,760 --> 01:08:36,290
- The broker is incredible.
- The broker is so quick.

2142
01:08:36,430 --> 01:08:39,110
Good job. That was so quick.

2143
01:08:39,110 --> 01:08:41,240
- When did the broker do it?
- When did the broker do it?

2144
01:08:41,540 --> 01:08:42,740
All right.

2145
01:08:42,740 --> 01:08:44,750
Let's get ready
for the last mission.

2146
01:08:44,750 --> 01:08:45,750
- Okay.
- Okay.

2147
01:08:45,750 --> 01:08:49,780
(Hot Item Selection Status)

2148
01:08:50,420 --> 01:08:52,840
(The last mission to win hot items)

2149
01:08:52,840 --> 01:08:56,360
(A refreshing water-sled race
with the brokers)

2150
01:08:57,160 --> 01:08:59,530
(The third mission is finished.)

2151
01:09:00,750 --> 01:09:03,200
Let me announce the results
of the last mission.

2152
01:09:03,330 --> 01:09:05,170
Team Sang Woo is in 1st place
with 11 points.

2153
01:09:05,170 --> 01:09:06,260
(Team Sang Woo in 1st place)

2154
01:09:06,260 --> 01:09:07,830
Team Sunhwa is in 2nd place
with 10 points.

2155
01:09:07,830 --> 01:09:09,290
(Team Sunhwa in 2nd place)

2156
01:09:09,290 --> 01:09:10,960
Team Chang Wook is in 3rd place
with 8 points.

2157
01:09:11,260 --> 01:09:12,760
Team Yoo Jung is in 4th place
with 7 points.

2158
01:09:12,760 --> 01:09:13,930
That's a shame.

2159
01:09:13,930 --> 01:09:16,210
Please choose your last item.

2160
01:09:16,300 --> 01:09:17,870
- Are we choosing 1?
- Yes, choose 1.

2161
01:09:18,500 --> 01:09:20,110
- We choose Coke.
- Let's go for Coke.

2162
01:09:20,210 --> 01:09:21,450
Really?

2163
01:09:21,450 --> 01:09:23,250
(Team Sunhwa chooses stockings.)

2164
01:09:23,250 --> 01:09:24,540
- All right. Let's choose stockings.
- Okay.

2165
01:09:24,840 --> 01:09:26,010
- I vote for tissues.
- Tissues?

2166
01:09:26,010 --> 01:09:27,290
- Tissues.
- Okay, tissues.

2167
01:09:27,290 --> 01:09:29,580
(Team Chang Wook chooses tissues.)

2168
01:09:29,580 --> 01:09:31,620
(Team Yoo Jung chooses
ice cubes in a cup.)

2169
01:09:31,860 --> 01:09:33,120
Ice cubes in a cup?

2170
01:09:33,120 --> 01:09:34,620
This is what I buy most often.

2171
01:09:34,620 --> 01:09:36,200
- Yoo Jung.
- Let her choose.

2172
01:09:36,200 --> 01:09:37,330
I think we should choose
a fish cake bar.

2173
01:09:37,330 --> 01:09:38,400
Yoo Jung, you get to decide.

2174
01:09:39,030 --> 01:09:40,830
I think she's a broker.

2175
01:09:41,130 --> 01:09:43,330
- Trust me.
- That's a surprising choice.

2176
01:09:43,460 --> 01:09:44,910
- I know.
- Gosh.

2177
01:09:45,540 --> 01:09:48,370
Let me announce
the brokers' last proposals.

2178
01:09:48,370 --> 01:09:51,500
Broker A proposed a deal to
Team Yoo Jung and Team Chang Wook.

2179
01:09:51,500 --> 01:09:52,670
(Team Yoo Jung and Team Chang Wook)

2180
01:09:52,670 --> 01:09:55,340
Broker B proposed a deal
to Team Sang Woo.

2181
01:09:56,340 --> 01:09:57,580
- Broker B.
- Should we get a hint?

2182
01:09:57,710 --> 01:09:59,010
- We didn't get any proposals?
- No.

2183
01:09:59,010 --> 01:10:01,860
(Team Sunhwa is the only team
that didn't get any proposal.)

2184
01:10:01,860 --> 01:10:03,010
I think...

2185
01:10:03,010 --> 01:10:04,790
(They have to decide
whether to accept the deal or not.)

2186
01:10:04,790 --> 01:10:06,330
We should accept the deal...

2187
01:10:06,720 --> 01:10:08,920
- and win another item.
- Right.

2188
01:10:08,920 --> 01:10:10,550
- Let's do that.
- I know one of the brokers.

2189
01:10:12,200 --> 01:10:13,370
What did you see?

2190
01:10:13,370 --> 01:10:15,670
I saw the broker...

2191
01:10:15,670 --> 01:10:18,110
write something and submit it.

2192
01:10:18,110 --> 01:10:19,540
- I saw it clearly.
- Really?

2193
01:10:19,540 --> 01:10:21,830
I saw it with my own eyes.

2194
01:10:22,540 --> 01:10:23,830
- Really?
- Yes.

2195
01:10:23,830 --> 01:10:25,280
I know who it is.

2196
01:10:25,280 --> 01:10:26,340
(Does Chang Wook really know
who the broker is?)

2197
01:10:26,340 --> 01:10:27,410
We want a hint...

2198
01:10:27,410 --> 01:10:29,320
- It's a hint about Broker A, right?
- It's about Broker A.

2199
01:10:29,420 --> 01:10:31,040
- We want the hint.
- We want the hint.

2200
01:10:31,040 --> 01:10:33,320
- Let's have a look.
- Just a second.

2201
01:10:33,380 --> 01:10:34,490
We won't swipe.

2202
01:10:34,880 --> 01:10:36,360
- What's that?
- Is that a hint?

2203
01:10:36,620 --> 01:10:38,120
It's from the broker.

2204
01:10:38,380 --> 01:10:40,250
- The broker took this picture?
- Yes.

2205
01:10:40,330 --> 01:10:41,790
Think of what's going on
in this picture.

2206
01:10:42,290 --> 01:10:44,330
- Where was this?
- So the broker is...

2207
01:10:44,500 --> 01:10:45,920
The broker is not
one of the people in the picture.

2208
01:10:46,290 --> 01:10:48,330
- Where was this?
- Isn't that me?

2209
01:10:48,330 --> 01:10:50,260
- No.
- That cap is mine.

2210
01:10:50,870 --> 01:10:52,460
- No, it isn't.
- It isn't?

2211
01:10:52,710 --> 01:10:53,830
- No.
- No?

2212
01:10:53,830 --> 01:10:55,130
It's Sang Woo.

2213
01:10:55,500 --> 01:10:56,710
Why are they looking at you?

2214
01:10:57,300 --> 01:10:58,650
- Why are they looking at me?
- They looked at you.

2215
01:10:59,650 --> 01:11:00,870
It must be a picture.

2216
01:11:00,870 --> 01:11:02,040
(Sang Woo has no idea.)

2217
01:11:02,040 --> 01:11:04,150
- The broker sent this picture?
- Yes.

2218
01:11:04,320 --> 01:11:05,540
To choose the team?

2219
01:11:06,490 --> 01:11:08,290
What do the other teams want?

2220
01:11:08,290 --> 01:11:10,010
- We want a hint.
- We want a hint.

2221
01:11:10,490 --> 01:11:13,160
You want a hint about Broker B.

2222
01:11:13,420 --> 01:11:15,700
We have no hints,
so we'll have to take a guess.

2223
01:11:17,220 --> 01:11:18,330
What's this?

2224
01:11:18,330 --> 01:11:19,790
(A hint about Broker B
for Team Sang Woo)

2225
01:11:19,790 --> 01:11:23,370
The broker submitted this
to choose us?

2226
01:11:23,370 --> 01:11:25,800
Is this how he proposed a deal?

2227
01:11:25,800 --> 01:11:28,430
Try to think of the situation and
guess whose handwriting this is.

2228
01:11:28,430 --> 01:11:31,580
- Kwang Soo and Jae Suk were...
- Kwang Soo was wearing gloves.

2229
01:11:31,580 --> 01:11:32,750
He was, right?

2230
01:11:32,750 --> 01:11:35,540
(A moment ago)

2231
01:11:35,540 --> 01:11:39,750
(Kwang Soo was wearing
gloves the whole time.)

2232
01:11:39,750 --> 01:11:44,830
(Is Kwang Soo Broker B?)

2233
01:11:45,290 --> 01:11:46,920
- Let's see.
- How big is it?

2234
01:11:47,220 --> 01:11:48,420
- Well...
- The broker has big hands.

2235
01:11:48,550 --> 01:11:50,200
The bottom of my hand is here.

2236
01:11:50,860 --> 01:11:52,090
This is a lot bigger than my hand.

2237
01:11:52,090 --> 01:11:54,400
(The glove is a lot bigger
than So Min's hand.)

2238
01:11:54,790 --> 01:11:56,760
- Spread your fingers.
- Why?

2239
01:11:56,760 --> 01:11:57,910
(So Min examines Kwang Soo's hand.)

2240
01:11:58,410 --> 01:12:00,260
(Like the prince looking for
the owner of a glass slipper,)

2241
01:12:00,260 --> 01:12:02,970
(So Min is looking for
the owner of the glove.)

2242
01:12:02,970 --> 01:12:04,670
(Laughing)

2243
01:12:06,450 --> 01:12:08,010
- It's a man, right?
- It is.

2244
01:12:08,010 --> 01:12:09,080
- Right?
- Because...

2245
01:12:09,080 --> 01:12:10,780
the fingers are so long.

2246
01:12:10,780 --> 01:12:12,290
Look at this.

2247
01:12:12,620 --> 01:12:13,840
This is where the fingers bend.

2248
01:12:13,840 --> 01:12:14,990
Is Kwang Soo a broker?

2249
01:12:15,660 --> 01:12:17,490
Why? What's the hint?

2250
01:12:17,710 --> 01:12:19,160
- Kwang Soo, are you a broker?
- No.

2251
01:12:19,250 --> 01:12:20,330
All right.

2252
01:12:20,620 --> 01:12:22,290
- What do you want to do?
- We accept the deal.

2253
01:12:22,420 --> 01:12:23,420
- You do?
- Yes.

2254
01:12:23,420 --> 01:12:24,830
Then choose an item.

2255
01:12:24,830 --> 01:12:26,330
(Team Chang Wook chooses
an additional item.)

2256
01:12:26,330 --> 01:12:27,830
I want to choose coffee.

2257
01:12:28,200 --> 01:12:29,330
Coffee?

2258
01:12:29,400 --> 01:12:31,000
- Canned coffee?
- Let's do this.

2259
01:12:32,300 --> 01:12:35,370
All teams are done choosing items.

2260
01:12:35,370 --> 01:12:38,910
(Team Yoo Jung, Team Sunhwa,
Team Sang Woo, Team Chang Wook)

2261
01:12:39,610 --> 01:12:43,320
(Both Brokers A and B
made 3 successful deals.)

2262
01:12:43,320 --> 01:12:44,420
(It's time to catch the brokers.)

2263
01:12:44,420 --> 01:12:46,920
First, you'll catch the brokers.

2264
01:12:47,080 --> 01:12:48,580
If you choose to catch the brokers,

2265
01:12:48,660 --> 01:12:50,920
you have to guess both brokers.

2266
01:12:51,550 --> 01:12:53,580
You can put
a "multiply by two" sticker...

2267
01:12:53,580 --> 01:12:55,920
on as many items as the number
of brokers you catch.

2268
01:12:56,090 --> 01:12:57,920
- On the items we choose?
- You'll also put...

2269
01:12:57,920 --> 01:12:59,620
a "divide by two" sticker
on as many items...

2270
01:12:59,620 --> 01:13:01,330
as the number of brokers
you fail to catch.

2271
01:13:01,460 --> 01:13:03,830
- "Divide by two"?
- We have to catch both brokers?

2272
01:13:03,830 --> 01:13:05,870
Yes, then you'll get
two "multiply by two" stickers.

2273
01:13:05,870 --> 01:13:08,300
- What if we catch only one?
- You'll get one of each.

2274
01:13:08,300 --> 01:13:09,780
(They get "multiply by 2"
and "divide by 2" stickers.)

2275
01:13:09,780 --> 01:13:11,470
Also, the brokers will lose...

2276
01:13:11,470 --> 01:13:13,300
as many items...

2277
01:13:13,300 --> 01:13:15,170
as the number of teams
that catch them.

2278
01:13:15,950 --> 01:13:17,650
- We'll...
- We'll stay out.

2279
01:13:17,650 --> 01:13:19,420
We have no hints.

2280
01:13:19,420 --> 01:13:20,950
We'll stay out.

2281
01:13:21,210 --> 01:13:22,460
Team Sunhwa stays out.

2282
01:13:22,820 --> 01:13:25,160
- Do you want to catch the brokers?
- Yes, we do.

2283
01:13:25,160 --> 01:13:27,080
- We want to catch the brokers.
- Let's try.

2284
01:13:27,290 --> 01:13:29,420
- We want to catch the brokers.
- Okay.

2285
01:13:29,420 --> 01:13:31,030
Three teams want to catch
the brokers.

2286
01:13:31,030 --> 01:13:33,870
Discuss for a minute
and tell us your decision.

2287
01:13:34,570 --> 01:13:36,700
- Come here.
- Since we know...

2288
01:13:36,700 --> 01:13:39,040
- We know one broker for sure.
- We know one.

2289
01:13:39,040 --> 01:13:40,430
Who is it?

2290
01:13:40,430 --> 01:13:45,080
- One of them is Kwang Soo.
- Me?

2291
01:13:45,300 --> 01:13:47,210
- Right?
- It's not me.

2292
01:13:47,210 --> 01:13:48,210
(Chang Wook suspects Kwang Soo.)

2293
01:13:48,210 --> 01:13:49,370
Right?

2294
01:13:49,470 --> 01:13:51,340
What are you talking about?

2295
01:13:51,340 --> 01:13:54,120
I thought so too.

2296
01:13:54,120 --> 01:13:56,510
(Kwang Soo follows them.)

2297
01:13:56,550 --> 01:13:57,620
I saw it.

2298
01:13:58,380 --> 01:13:59,530
I saw it.

2299
01:13:59,530 --> 01:14:00,550
Shut it.

2300
01:14:00,550 --> 01:14:02,500
(Kwang Soo is cornered
and swears at Chang Wook.)

2301
01:14:04,200 --> 01:14:06,070
(When the brokers were
being decided...)

2302
01:14:06,070 --> 01:14:07,090
(You're a broker.)

2303
01:14:07,090 --> 01:14:08,290
(Take a picture of the name tag
or write down...)

2304
01:14:08,290 --> 01:14:09,500
(the name of the person
you want to propose a deal to.)

2305
01:14:10,090 --> 01:14:14,000
(Kwang Soo was chosen as a broker.)

2306
01:14:14,000 --> 01:14:16,500
(While everyone was busy
carrying out missions,)

2307
01:14:16,500 --> 01:14:18,250
(he wrote down names
on all kinds of things,)

2308
01:14:18,250 --> 01:14:21,340
(including a blindfold
and a ramyeon seasoning bag.)

2309
01:14:21,340 --> 01:14:24,170
(The glove was Kwang Soo's too.)

2310
01:14:24,170 --> 01:14:26,990
(Han Sunhwa, Ji Chang Wook,
Kim Yoo Jung, Do Sang Woo)

2311
01:14:27,250 --> 01:14:32,030
(He wasn't afraid to propose
a deal in any situation.)

2312
01:14:32,220 --> 01:14:35,160
(In the end, he was witnessed
by Chang Wook.)

2313
01:14:35,400 --> 01:14:37,620
(Is Kwang Soo a broker?)

2314
01:14:38,290 --> 01:14:39,790
- I saw it.
- Shut it.

2315
01:14:39,790 --> 01:14:43,290
(The broker tries to
shut Chang Wook's mouth.)

2316
01:14:43,870 --> 01:14:46,870
(Kwang Soo, you're busted!)

2317
01:14:47,300 --> 01:14:49,130
Shut it before the other teams
find out.

2318
01:14:50,410 --> 01:14:52,170
Can't we just guess one broker?

2319
01:14:52,170 --> 01:14:54,040
- You have to guess both.
- Gosh, this is driving me crazy.

2320
01:14:54,410 --> 01:14:55,620
I told you.

2321
01:14:56,470 --> 01:15:00,340
I'm not entirely sure
whose handwriting this is, but...

2322
01:15:01,080 --> 01:15:02,250
- Who do you think it is?
- I think...

2323
01:15:02,250 --> 01:15:03,420
this is...

2324
01:15:04,360 --> 01:15:05,530
Chang Wook's handwriting.

2325
01:15:05,530 --> 01:15:06,990
(It's Kwang Soo's handwriting.)

2326
01:15:06,990 --> 01:15:08,360
- Can't we make him write something?
- It's similar.

2327
01:15:08,360 --> 01:15:10,000
(Yoo Jung makes a wrong guess.)

2328
01:15:10,000 --> 01:15:11,620
- You've seen his handwriting?
- Yes.

2329
01:15:12,120 --> 01:15:13,500
- I've seen it.
- Really?

2330
01:15:13,670 --> 01:15:15,090
I'm sure.

2331
01:15:15,090 --> 01:15:16,460
- Let's do it.
- I'm 100 percent sure.

2332
01:15:16,700 --> 01:15:18,960
Chang Wook, who do you think
the other broker is?

2333
01:15:18,960 --> 01:15:20,130
(Chang Wook and Ji Hyo know
one broker for sure.)

2334
01:15:20,130 --> 01:15:22,210
- The brokers were chosen randomly.
- Yes.

2335
01:15:22,210 --> 01:15:23,500
(If they guess both right, they get
2 "multiply by 2" stickers.)

2336
01:15:23,500 --> 01:15:26,080
I should try to catch
the other broker too.

2337
01:15:26,080 --> 01:15:27,250
(Kwang Soo joins the investigation.)

2338
01:15:27,250 --> 01:15:29,080
- The other broker took a picture.
- The other broker...

2339
01:15:29,150 --> 01:15:30,540
sent a picture.

2340
01:15:30,670 --> 01:15:32,080
Who used a phone?

2341
01:15:32,510 --> 01:15:35,580
I'm suspecting
Sunhwa and Yoo Jung.

2342
01:15:35,710 --> 01:15:37,990
Yoo Jung kept hovering around there.

2343
01:15:37,990 --> 01:15:41,420
(Is the other broker
one of the two?)

2344
01:15:42,330 --> 01:15:44,250
- Yoo Jung?
- Yoo Jung?

2345
01:15:45,030 --> 01:15:46,170
Kwang Soo!

2346
01:15:46,400 --> 01:15:47,570
We're done.

2347
01:15:47,790 --> 01:15:49,000
Let's just write it.

2348
01:15:49,570 --> 01:15:52,000
(Team Sang Woo and Team Yoo Jung
have made their choices too.)

2349
01:15:52,000 --> 01:15:54,040
I'm not sure about that one,
but it's probably right.

2350
01:15:54,410 --> 01:15:55,540
Right?

2351
01:15:56,280 --> 01:15:58,340
Everyone is suspecting everyone.

2352
01:15:58,340 --> 01:16:02,120
Let me announce
the three teams' choices first...

2353
01:16:02,120 --> 01:16:04,990
- and then who the brokers are.
- Okay.

2354
01:16:05,450 --> 01:16:06,680
Team Sang Woo chose...

2355
01:16:07,290 --> 01:16:08,490
Kwang Soo and Jae Suk.

2356
01:16:08,920 --> 01:16:10,120
Me?

2357
01:16:10,120 --> 01:16:11,160
- And...
- Why me?

2358
01:16:11,160 --> 01:16:12,250
He sounds surprised.

2359
01:16:13,080 --> 01:16:14,490
Team Yoo Jung chose...

2360
01:16:15,050 --> 01:16:16,500
Chang Wook and Jong Kook.

2361
01:16:17,500 --> 01:16:18,830
- Me?
- Yes.

2362
01:16:18,830 --> 01:16:20,030
Team Chang Wook chose...

2363
01:16:20,220 --> 01:16:21,290
Kwang Soo and Yoo Jung.

2364
01:16:21,930 --> 01:16:23,570
Kwang Soo and Yoo Jung.

2365
01:16:24,040 --> 01:16:25,870
- They picked one from their team?
- I'm speechless.

2366
01:16:25,960 --> 01:16:27,240
I don't know.

2367
01:16:27,300 --> 01:16:30,610
I kept saying it's not me,
but they won't listen.

2368
01:16:30,870 --> 01:16:34,540
- Kwang Soo came out as a broker.
- True.

2369
01:16:34,670 --> 01:16:38,040
- They were whispering behind me.
- Hey.

2370
01:16:38,040 --> 01:16:39,510
That's not why.

2371
01:16:39,510 --> 01:16:41,180
I caught him.

2372
01:16:41,180 --> 01:16:42,380
- What are you talking about?
- What?

2373
01:16:42,550 --> 01:16:44,380
- He was passing off a memo...
- Shut your mouth!

2374
01:16:44,380 --> 01:16:45,720
(He explodes.)

2375
01:16:47,620 --> 01:16:49,250
- Really?
- It is you.

2376
01:16:49,250 --> 01:16:51,090
- What? It's not me.
- It's you.

2377
01:16:51,090 --> 01:16:52,260
It's not.

2378
01:16:52,260 --> 01:16:54,030
Let me announce the brokers.

2379
01:16:54,200 --> 01:16:55,460
The brokers are...

2380
01:16:55,460 --> 01:16:56,760
(Kwang Soo got exposed,
and there's one more.)

2381
01:16:56,760 --> 01:17:01,500
(Unlike him,
Broker A is still a mystery.)

2382
01:17:01,630 --> 01:17:04,110
The brokers are
Kwang Soo and Chang Wook.

2383
01:17:04,110 --> 01:17:06,450
(The brokers are
Kwang Soo and Chang Wook!)

2384
01:17:06,910 --> 01:17:09,840
That's what I said!

2385
01:17:09,840 --> 01:17:11,920
This is unbelievable.

2386
01:17:11,920 --> 01:17:13,380
- It was so obvious.
- Hey!

2387
01:17:13,820 --> 01:17:16,550
- See? Chang Wook acted weird today.
- That's what I said!

2388
01:17:16,550 --> 01:17:19,490
(He feigned innocence
and exposed Kwang Soo.)

2389
01:17:20,080 --> 01:17:23,360
(There's nobody you can trust
in the world of brokers.)

2390
01:17:25,570 --> 01:17:26,900
I have to look by myself.

2391
01:17:26,900 --> 01:17:28,790
(When the brokers were
being selected...)

2392
01:17:29,040 --> 01:17:30,040
(Take a picture of the name tag
or write down...)

2393
01:17:30,040 --> 01:17:31,040
(the name of the person
you want to propose a deal to.)

2394
01:17:31,040 --> 01:17:34,000
(Chang Wook was selected
as the broker.)

2395
01:17:34,000 --> 01:17:35,930
(He approached them quietly...)

2396
01:17:35,930 --> 01:17:38,540
(and took pictures.)

2397
01:17:39,340 --> 01:17:41,780
(Chang Wook was
a silent photographer.)

2398
01:17:41,780 --> 01:17:43,340
I caught him.

2399
01:17:43,340 --> 01:17:45,580
(When he realized what Kwang Soo
was, he diverted attention.)

2400
01:17:45,920 --> 01:17:48,620
(That's how Broker Ji Chang Wook
gained everybody's trust.)

2401
01:17:49,580 --> 01:17:52,290
I did catch you though.

2402
01:17:52,290 --> 01:17:53,750
You're Broker B, right?

2403
01:17:54,620 --> 01:17:56,620
I was right!

2404
01:17:57,360 --> 01:17:59,030
She guessed it right.

2405
01:17:59,030 --> 01:18:02,090
Yoo Jung said
it was Chang Wook's writing.

2406
01:18:02,090 --> 01:18:03,930
That was good, Chang Wook.

2407
01:18:03,930 --> 01:18:06,210
Where did they go? Crazy people.

2408
01:18:06,370 --> 01:18:08,610
I did catch you though.

2409
01:18:08,610 --> 01:18:10,930
- They're fighting.
- It was them.

2410
01:18:10,930 --> 01:18:12,540
Hey, you...

2411
01:18:12,540 --> 01:18:14,370
(Cursing and grabbing him by
the throat after being betrayed)

2412
01:18:14,370 --> 01:18:15,470
Did he lose?

2413
01:18:15,470 --> 01:18:17,710
Chang Wook exposed Kwang Soo.

2414
01:18:17,710 --> 01:18:19,540
We're both brokers,
and he ratted me out.

2415
01:18:19,620 --> 01:18:23,050
Kwang Soo, you got arrested,

2416
01:18:23,050 --> 01:18:25,360
so you can choose one item.

2417
01:18:25,360 --> 01:18:27,250
Chang Wook, you can choose two.

2418
01:18:27,250 --> 01:18:28,550
Only two? Rather than that...

2419
01:18:28,550 --> 01:18:29,720
See? We're in first place.

2420
01:18:29,720 --> 01:18:31,200
We might win.

2421
01:18:31,200 --> 01:18:32,420
- See? We're in first place.
- That's true.

2422
01:18:32,420 --> 01:18:33,530
We might win.

2423
01:18:33,530 --> 01:18:35,540
Three teams,
please add "multiply by two"...

2424
01:18:35,540 --> 01:18:37,400
and "divide by two"
on items you want.

2425
01:18:37,400 --> 01:18:39,070
That was close.

2426
01:18:39,130 --> 01:18:41,040
Yoo Jung, you can put
"multiply by two" wherever you want.

2427
01:18:41,040 --> 01:18:42,580
Brokers, please decide.

2428
01:18:42,580 --> 01:18:43,930
Do they steal our items?

2429
01:18:43,930 --> 01:18:45,110
Go ahead.

2430
01:18:45,110 --> 01:18:46,250
Do whatever you want.

2431
01:18:46,250 --> 01:18:47,580
This is the ice cream.

2432
01:18:47,580 --> 01:18:50,250
We have to put "divide by two"
on an item with a low score.

2433
01:18:50,250 --> 01:18:52,080
- Low score.
- Something that'll sell the least.

2434
01:18:52,080 --> 01:18:53,150
Let's choose the packed meal.

2435
01:18:53,880 --> 01:18:56,460
Brokers, please use items as well.

2436
01:18:56,510 --> 01:18:58,420
- I'll choose canned coffee.
- Canned coffee?

2437
01:18:58,530 --> 01:18:59,920
What about you, Chang Wook?

2438
01:18:59,920 --> 01:19:02,090
I'll choose stockings...

2439
01:19:02,200 --> 01:19:03,790
and ice cream.

2440
01:19:03,860 --> 01:19:06,090
- Ice cream?
- Ice cream.

2441
01:19:06,220 --> 01:19:09,070
(They put the stickers on.
Brokers chose their items as well!)

2442
01:19:09,170 --> 01:19:11,630
I'll announce the final rankings.

2443
01:19:11,630 --> 01:19:12,830
I really want to know.

2444
01:19:13,460 --> 01:19:16,170
- You never know. We might win.
- I know.

2445
01:19:16,170 --> 01:19:18,080
- Should we open this?
- Yes.

2446
01:19:18,080 --> 01:19:19,410
1, 2, 3.

2447
01:19:19,410 --> 01:19:21,580
(How were the convenience store
hot items ranked?)

2448
01:19:21,580 --> 01:19:22,970
I see the large bottle of water.

2449
01:19:23,780 --> 01:19:25,620
A cup of ice is in first place?

2450
01:19:25,620 --> 01:19:27,650
- We're first!
- It's us!

2451
01:19:27,650 --> 01:19:28,680
Is this in first place?

2452
01:19:28,680 --> 01:19:30,120
I told you it was ice.

2453
01:19:30,120 --> 01:19:31,580
- Look at second place.
- We got it.

2454
01:19:31,790 --> 01:19:34,120
See? There's banana milk.

2455
01:19:34,220 --> 01:19:35,420
Banana milk...

2456
01:19:35,420 --> 01:19:36,860
How is
the large bottle of water here?

2457
01:19:37,050 --> 01:19:38,590
It's what we said.

2458
01:19:38,590 --> 01:19:40,670
- People buy water a lot.
- Exactly.

2459
01:19:41,220 --> 01:19:43,590
- We were right.
- I suggested it.

2460
01:19:43,790 --> 01:19:45,500
- We were right.
- Where are the stockings?

2461
01:19:46,130 --> 01:19:47,570
They're not here at all.

2462
01:19:48,130 --> 01:19:51,170
- This was unexpected.
- This is not what we thought.

2463
01:19:51,170 --> 01:19:53,040
Yoo Jung, you did great.

2464
01:19:53,040 --> 01:19:54,150
Yoo Jung.

2465
01:19:54,150 --> 01:19:56,580
Here are the scores.

2466
01:19:56,750 --> 01:19:58,380
First place is...

2467
01:19:59,010 --> 01:20:02,680
(Which team got 1st place?)

2468
01:20:03,550 --> 01:20:05,220
Team Yoo Jung with 30 points.

2469
01:20:05,580 --> 01:20:06,830
Yes!

2470
01:20:06,830 --> 01:20:08,790
(Team Yoo Jung with 30 points)

2471
01:20:08,790 --> 01:20:10,160
(They won with the cup of ice,
with points multiplied by 2.)

2472
01:20:10,160 --> 01:20:11,920
No way. Only if it wasn't
in first place...

2473
01:20:12,090 --> 01:20:14,070
We were in last place
the whole time.

2474
01:20:14,070 --> 01:20:15,570
We won hands down because of her.

2475
01:20:15,570 --> 01:20:17,170
- How did she think of cup of ice?
- It was just one item.

2476
01:20:17,170 --> 01:20:18,260
We would have won with that.

2477
01:20:18,260 --> 01:20:19,760
How did she think of cup of ice?

2478
01:20:19,760 --> 01:20:21,210
- I didn't think of it at all.
- 2nd and 3rd places...

2479
01:20:21,210 --> 01:20:22,630
were 2 points apart.

2480
01:20:22,630 --> 01:20:23,800
It's us.

2481
01:20:23,800 --> 01:20:26,500
2nd place is Team Sunhwa
with 22 points.

2482
01:20:27,040 --> 01:20:29,120
- We did well.
- Good job.

2483
01:20:29,120 --> 01:20:30,840
3rd place is Team Sang Woo
with 20 points.

2484
01:20:31,680 --> 01:20:33,180
- Are we in third place?
- That was close.

2485
01:20:33,180 --> 01:20:35,290
At least we're not in last place.

2486
01:20:35,360 --> 01:20:37,820
Team Chang Wook,
Ji Hyo earned 13 points,

2487
01:20:37,820 --> 01:20:40,530
Kwang Soo earned 4 points,
and Chang Wook earned 0.

2488
01:20:40,530 --> 01:20:43,250
(Brokers Chang Wook and Kwang Soo
earned 0 and 4 points.)

2489
01:20:43,250 --> 01:20:45,120
- This is fun.
- This is fun.

2490
01:20:45,120 --> 01:20:46,720
You darn brokers.

2491
01:20:46,720 --> 01:20:48,570
- Brokers.
- Serves you right.

2492
01:20:48,740 --> 01:20:52,260
The prizes are 10 popular items
from the convenience store...

2493
01:20:52,260 --> 01:20:54,300
- Really?
- and convenience store gift card.

2494
01:20:54,300 --> 01:20:56,240
- There's a gift card?
- I'm envious.

2495
01:20:56,240 --> 01:20:57,580
(We would like to thank
Chang Wook, Yoo Jung,)

2496
01:20:57,580 --> 01:20:58,870
(Sunhwa, and Sang Woo for joining
us in the early summer heat.)

2497
01:20:58,870 --> 01:21:00,950
- Great work.
- Thank you.

2498
01:21:00,950 --> 01:21:03,420
- Great work.
- Great work.

2499
01:21:04,170 --> 01:21:05,290
I'm scared.

2500
01:21:05,290 --> 01:21:07,880
(There are three kinds of people
in this world.)

2501
01:21:07,880 --> 01:21:08,920
Ji Hyo!

2502
01:21:08,920 --> 01:21:10,120
(Those on top,)

2503
01:21:10,120 --> 01:21:11,380
(those on the bottom,)

2504
01:21:11,510 --> 01:21:13,290
What's going on?

2505
01:21:13,290 --> 01:21:15,290
(and those who betray)

2506
01:21:15,360 --> 01:21:17,500
(This coin sharing is to test
the loyalty of Running Man members.)

2507
01:21:17,830 --> 01:21:19,830
(United we stand
and divided we fall!)

2508
01:21:20,220 --> 01:21:23,260
(It's an intense race where people
without their trust get eliminated.)

2509
01:21:23,900 --> 01:21:25,740
(Viewers' reports
finally get revealed.)

2510
01:21:26,110 --> 01:21:27,830
(From Jae Suk's first kiss...)

2511
01:21:27,830 --> 01:21:30,740
(to seeing him at the sauna)

2512
01:21:30,740 --> 01:21:31,950
Can this be on TV?

2513
01:21:31,950 --> 01:21:33,500
A woman who lived overseas.

2514
01:21:33,500 --> 01:21:35,670
(Will Jong Kook's love story get
revealed for the first time?)

2515
01:21:35,670 --> 01:21:38,150
So Min was in front of
the waiting room with somebody else.

2516
01:21:38,150 --> 01:21:39,290
(Does So Min's past make her
put her head down?)

2517
01:21:39,290 --> 01:21:40,340
Who was it?

2518
01:21:40,340 --> 01:21:43,620
(The viewers' eyewitnesses
add substance to the revelations.)

2519
01:21:43,920 --> 01:21:46,860
(Is there no loyalty?
You can look forward to next week!)

2520
