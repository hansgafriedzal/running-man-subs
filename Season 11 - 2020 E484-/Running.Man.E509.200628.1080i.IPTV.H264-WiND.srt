1
00:00:08,420 --> 00:00:12,450
(It's a summer day with a heatwave.)

2
00:00:12,450 --> 00:00:14,460
(Oil Tank Culture Park)

3
00:00:14,460 --> 00:00:15,730
Hello.

4
00:00:15,730 --> 00:00:18,590
- Hello.
- Hello.

5
00:00:20,060 --> 00:00:21,140
Good morning.

6
00:00:21,400 --> 00:00:23,770
- Wang Soo.
- What?

7
00:00:23,810 --> 00:00:26,000
I heard Wang Soo was Kwang Soo's
childhood nickname.

8
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,410
I just told you about it in private.
Why would you say that?

9
00:00:28,410 --> 00:00:29,500
Were you called Wang Soo?

10
00:00:29,500 --> 00:00:31,000
- My family called me like that.
- Why?

11
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:33,720
Today's about superpowers.

12
00:00:33,720 --> 00:00:37,250
Welcome to the entrance ceremony
of Running Man Superpower School.

13
00:00:37,250 --> 00:00:38,390
All right.

14
00:00:39,010 --> 00:00:41,920
Today, you are the seniors
of Superpower School.

15
00:00:41,990 --> 00:00:45,680
I want you to be good mentors for
the freshmen who are joining soon.

16
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:47,250
- So this is the entrance ceremony.
- We are mentors indeed.

17
00:00:47,250 --> 00:00:50,820
I'm not sure
what our superpowers are yet.

18
00:00:52,400 --> 00:00:55,400
(A few hours ago,
Room of Superpowers)

19
00:00:58,740 --> 00:01:02,680
(Kwang Soo walks into the Room of
Superpowers, full of expectation.)

20
00:01:03,610 --> 00:01:05,680
This is just too cool.

21
00:01:05,820 --> 00:01:07,070
Just open it.

22
00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:09,510
(What is my superpower?)

23
00:01:09,510 --> 00:01:10,740
What is my superpower?

24
00:01:11,610 --> 00:01:13,460
"You are an invisible man."

25
00:01:14,190 --> 00:01:15,210
"Doing mosquito dance..."

26
00:01:15,210 --> 00:01:16,430
(You're an invisible man.
Doing mosquito dance...)

27
00:01:16,430 --> 00:01:18,350
(Mosquito dance?)

28
00:01:18,350 --> 00:01:19,960
"You are an invisible man."

29
00:01:20,630 --> 00:01:21,830
"Doing mosquito dance,"

30
00:01:23,160 --> 00:01:25,220
"sing, 'You didn't see me,
you didn't see me'."

31
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:28,100
"Sing, 'You didn't see me,
you didn't see me'."

32
00:01:28,100 --> 00:01:29,300
(I'm supposed to do this?)

33
00:01:29,540 --> 00:01:31,300
"And put on the invisibility cloak."

34
00:01:31,300 --> 00:01:34,880
"Then you will stay invisible
until you take off the cloak."

35
00:01:35,080 --> 00:01:36,580
<i>A giant mosquito bit my foot</i>

36
00:01:36,580 --> 00:01:40,080
(I'm supposed to do this
in the Superpower School Race?)

37
00:01:40,080 --> 00:01:42,150
<i>It was itchy, but I put up with it</i>

38
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:44,350
I give up.

39
00:01:44,350 --> 00:01:45,820
(He decides to give up
after much consideration.)

40
00:01:46,850 --> 00:01:50,880
(He drinks the potion
that gives him a superpower.)

41
00:01:54,830 --> 00:01:59,190
(Once he sings,
he gets his superpower.)

42
00:02:02,830 --> 00:02:04,000
Do I have to sing now?

43
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,330
Yes, please.

44
00:02:05,710 --> 00:02:06,880
This is humiliating.

45
00:02:07,410 --> 00:02:09,300
I feel like I'm standing here naked.

46
00:02:12,940 --> 00:02:15,210
It's been over 10 years.

47
00:02:15,210 --> 00:02:16,810
(He shudders thinking about
his specialty from 10 years ago.)

48
00:02:19,020 --> 00:02:22,930
(He pulls himself together
and tries to focus.)

49
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:25,460
This is crazy.

50
00:02:25,460 --> 00:02:26,590
(This is crazy.)

51
00:02:27,050 --> 00:02:28,090
- I will give you the cloak.
- What?

52
00:02:28,700 --> 00:02:30,900
- This is the cloak?
- It's an invisibility cloak.

53
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:33,060
(This is the invisibility cloak?)

54
00:02:38,770 --> 00:02:42,430
(I'm an invisible man.
Please pretend you didn't see me.)

55
00:02:42,430 --> 00:02:46,020
(The cloak has an earnest request
of an invisible man on it.)

56
00:02:47,110 --> 00:02:49,780
(What's this?)

57
00:02:51,180 --> 00:02:52,610
I thought it'd be something cool.

58
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:56,390
(Even though it's not very cool...)

59
00:02:56,390 --> 00:02:58,650
<i>You didn't see me, you didn't see me</i>

60
00:02:58,650 --> 00:03:00,360
(Once he becomes invisible, he is
protected from all superpowers.)

61
00:03:01,150 --> 00:03:02,800
(Kwang Soo is invisible now.)

62
00:03:04,770 --> 00:03:07,200
(Invisible Man)

63
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:11,560
(The cloak makes him invisible and
protects him from all superpowers.)

64
00:03:14,710 --> 00:03:17,840
(- That was so cool.
- You deserve your award.)

65
00:03:18,340 --> 00:03:20,870
(His superpower comes with
embarrassment.)

66
00:03:20,870 --> 00:03:22,050
You deserve your award.

67
00:03:23,650 --> 00:03:27,490
"Your superpower lets you
summon a bodyguard."

68
00:03:27,860 --> 00:03:29,460
"Raise your arms overhead..."

69
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:32,020
(She laughs.)

70
00:03:32,020 --> 00:03:34,930
(Embarrassment comes
before a bodyguard does.)

71
00:03:35,260 --> 00:03:36,430
Hold on.

72
00:03:36,590 --> 00:03:38,270
This is... Hold on.

73
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:40,090
This...

74
00:03:40,090 --> 00:03:42,360
(This is why the members fear
Superpower Special.)

75
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:43,430
This is driving me crazy.

76
00:03:43,770 --> 00:03:45,770
I'm supposed to do this
in front of many people?

77
00:03:45,770 --> 00:03:47,080
- Yes.
- For three minutes?

78
00:03:47,480 --> 00:03:50,580
(She drinks her potion,
fighting embarrassment.)

79
00:03:58,240 --> 00:03:59,920
(Summon a bodyguard by raising
your arms overhead and singing.)

80
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:01,650
(However, bodyguards are only
for defense purposes.)

81
00:04:01,650 --> 00:04:02,680
Ta-da.

82
00:04:05,230 --> 00:04:08,020
(Bodyguard Summoner)

83
00:04:08,020 --> 00:04:12,120
(Your superpower allows you
to summon a person.)

84
00:04:12,430 --> 00:04:13,670
This is embarrassing.

85
00:04:13,670 --> 00:04:14,830
I'll leave.

86
00:04:16,140 --> 00:04:17,300
See you later.

87
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:21,810
(Here comes...)

88
00:04:24,340 --> 00:04:27,910
(Haha, the perfect member
for this theme.)

89
00:04:28,670 --> 00:04:31,190
(He is already immersed.)

90
00:04:31,190 --> 00:04:34,780
(He looks like
he is in his element.)

91
00:04:35,690 --> 00:04:38,580
(No one beats him
when it comes to themes like this.)

92
00:04:38,580 --> 00:04:41,420
"You are Captain Gravity."

93
00:04:42,700 --> 00:04:45,400
"To attack a member
out of your sight,"

94
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:48,000
"drop two apples..."

95
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,330
"and shout, 'Gravity!'"

96
00:04:49,900 --> 00:04:52,440
"It'll put 5kg sandbags..."

97
00:04:52,670 --> 00:04:55,230
"around the wrists and ankles
of the member,"

98
00:04:55,330 --> 00:04:57,580
"which will hinder his or her
movement for three minutes."

99
00:04:57,900 --> 00:04:59,270
Gravity, gravity...

100
00:04:59,270 --> 00:05:00,840
This word is hard to remember.

101
00:05:01,170 --> 00:05:02,210
Gravity.

102
00:05:02,210 --> 00:05:03,340
What does it mean?

103
00:05:03,410 --> 00:05:04,650
- It's a pulling force.
- What?

104
00:05:04,650 --> 00:05:05,710
Exactly.

105
00:05:07,410 --> 00:05:09,150
(His vocabulary can't keep up with
his enthusiasm.)

106
00:05:09,150 --> 00:05:10,480
I see. That's what it means.

107
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:14,850
To gravity.

108
00:05:14,850 --> 00:05:18,200
(He drinks to the word
he just learned.)

109
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:24,810
(Groaning)

110
00:05:24,810 --> 00:05:26,770
(Gravity fills my body.)

111
00:05:26,770 --> 00:05:27,970
Gravity!

112
00:05:31,100 --> 00:05:34,020
(Captain Gravity)

113
00:05:34,020 --> 00:05:37,480
(It gives a member of your choice
20kg of sandbags.)

114
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:39,960
"You are the Sorcerer
of Five Senses."

115
00:05:40,060 --> 00:05:41,320
"Hold up your hands
to your mouth..."

116
00:05:41,910 --> 00:05:43,920
"and shout, 'Jong Kook has
donkey ears!'"

117
00:05:44,020 --> 00:05:46,060
"It will let you eavesdrop
for three minutes..."

118
00:05:46,150 --> 00:05:48,130
"and find out
a member's superpower."

119
00:05:49,150 --> 00:05:50,830
I always get a useless superpower.

120
00:05:51,220 --> 00:05:52,900
Why did you give me this?

121
00:05:53,270 --> 00:05:54,830
It's completely useless.

122
00:05:56,230 --> 00:05:57,830
"You are Ttuk-nos."

123
00:05:58,210 --> 00:05:59,580
"Snap your fingers..."

124
00:05:59,580 --> 00:06:02,030
(Snap your fingers and sing to make
3 members freeze for a minute.)

125
00:06:02,030 --> 00:06:04,880
<i>Completely turn me over</i>

126
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:05,970
Like that?

127
00:06:07,270 --> 00:06:10,650
All right. Let's welcome
our freshmen.

128
00:06:10,650 --> 00:06:12,820
I heard their voices,
and it seems like...

129
00:06:12,820 --> 00:06:14,350
Suk Jin is one of them.

130
00:06:14,710 --> 00:06:16,850
I'm not sure if he's okay
with being a freshman.

131
00:06:16,850 --> 00:06:17,980
Congratulations.

132
00:06:17,980 --> 00:06:19,590
(Congratulations
on entering our school!)

133
00:06:19,590 --> 00:06:20,830
(One of the freshmen is
a bit too excited.)

134
00:06:20,830 --> 00:06:22,290
Hey, we're not doing that.

135
00:06:23,500 --> 00:06:26,000
(Their superpowers make them
even sillier.)

136
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,330
- We're your seniors.
- We're not doing that.

137
00:06:28,330 --> 00:06:30,070
(Someone definitely looks
more like a senior.)

138
00:06:30,140 --> 00:06:31,310
I'll never get used to this.

139
00:06:31,310 --> 00:06:32,460
(Running Man's 10th anniversary
is celebrated with two guests.)

140
00:06:32,570 --> 00:06:35,010
Hello.

141
00:06:35,010 --> 00:06:36,340
Hello, Seniors.

142
00:06:36,340 --> 00:06:38,540
- Welcome.
- Hello.

143
00:06:38,540 --> 00:06:41,080
- It's been a long time.
- They're so cute.

144
00:06:41,080 --> 00:06:42,710
- They're really cute.
- Hello.

145
00:06:42,710 --> 00:06:44,150
- Welcome to the school.
- Thank you.

146
00:06:44,150 --> 00:06:45,150
Han Na, come over here.

147
00:06:45,150 --> 00:06:46,150
What am I?

148
00:06:46,150 --> 00:06:47,260
Sang Yeob, come over here.

149
00:06:47,460 --> 00:06:49,260
- What am I?
- Love your classmates!

150
00:06:49,350 --> 00:06:50,560
- Love your classmates!
- Come here.

151
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:51,690
- I asked, what am I?
- One, two.

152
00:06:52,060 --> 00:06:53,630
You're an old man
with a passion for studying.

153
00:06:54,330 --> 00:06:56,500
- Why am I a freshman?
- You're a returning student.

154
00:06:56,500 --> 00:06:58,830
These five are freshmen
at Superpower School.

155
00:06:58,920 --> 00:07:02,030
According to Suk Jin's
superpower evaluation results,

156
00:07:02,030 --> 00:07:04,330
he failed to move on
to the next grade and is held back.

157
00:07:04,330 --> 00:07:05,830
(Suk Jin is held back.)

158
00:07:06,900 --> 00:07:09,010
(Even with his phoenix superpower,)

159
00:07:09,010 --> 00:07:12,470
(he got eliminated
three times in a row.)

160
00:07:12,470 --> 00:07:13,840
(No matter how good
his superpower is,)

161
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:17,190
(he always ends up
being a race starter.)

162
00:07:18,690 --> 00:07:20,620
(He has bad
superpower using skills.)

163
00:07:20,620 --> 00:07:24,280
(In the end, he gets held back.)

164
00:07:24,390 --> 00:07:25,460
He is held back?

165
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:27,150
That's why you're a freshman.

166
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:29,630
Gosh, this is driving me crazy.

167
00:07:29,790 --> 00:07:30,900
He's held back.

168
00:07:31,270 --> 00:07:33,400
As the freshman representative,

169
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:36,460
- Suk Jin will recite a pledge.
- It feels real.

170
00:07:36,460 --> 00:07:39,030
Seniors, please sit down.

171
00:07:39,940 --> 00:07:41,770
It feels more like
a principal's speech.

172
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:43,880
It feels...

173
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:45,170
Here.

174
00:07:45,170 --> 00:07:46,770
- Love your classmates!
- Get the chairs.

175
00:07:46,770 --> 00:07:48,450
- Love your school!
- Here.

176
00:07:49,210 --> 00:07:51,190
- Hello.
- Hi, Sang Yeob.

177
00:07:51,690 --> 00:07:52,780
Here's one more.

178
00:07:53,210 --> 00:07:54,560
- Take a seat.
- Let's sit down.

179
00:07:54,980 --> 00:07:56,330
All right.

180
00:07:56,980 --> 00:07:58,080
The freshman pledge.

181
00:07:58,890 --> 00:08:00,220
- We don't have to do it.
- We don't have to do it.

182
00:08:00,220 --> 00:08:02,630
- It's what we have to do.
- Please look at us.

183
00:08:02,630 --> 00:08:05,070
- We'll repeat after you.
- It's what we have to do.

184
00:08:05,070 --> 00:08:06,590
(The repeater already
makes a mistake.)

185
00:08:06,590 --> 00:08:08,960
All right. You guys don't know
how to use magic, do you?

186
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:10,960
(Arrogant)

187
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:12,070
- What?
- Superpowers...

188
00:08:12,070 --> 00:08:13,440
- Is it superpowers?
- It's superpowers.

189
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:15,530
He doesn't know anything.

190
00:08:15,830 --> 00:08:17,470
Let Sang Yeob do it instead.

191
00:08:17,470 --> 00:08:19,340
He can't do anything right.

192
00:08:20,270 --> 00:08:21,580
He knows even less than I do.

193
00:08:22,170 --> 00:08:24,040
- So it's superpowers.
- Just read out what's written.

194
00:08:24,280 --> 00:08:26,190
- He's blushing.
- Just do what you're told to do.

195
00:08:26,910 --> 00:08:28,260
Just recite the pledge.

196
00:08:28,260 --> 00:08:30,850
- What's wrong with him?
- Why did he say, "magic"?

197
00:08:32,020 --> 00:08:33,020
The freshman pledge.

198
00:08:33,020 --> 00:08:34,150
- The freshman pledge.
- The freshman pledge.

199
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:40,000
"As the new students entering
Superpower School in 2020,"

200
00:08:40,430 --> 00:08:42,430
"we will learn from
our seniors' ambitions..."

201
00:08:42,430 --> 00:08:45,470
"and work hard to develop
our own superpowers,"

202
00:08:45,470 --> 00:08:48,840
"so that we can use
our superpowers..."

203
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:51,170
"in an autonomous way."

204
00:08:51,170 --> 00:08:52,270
All right.

205
00:08:52,270 --> 00:08:54,810
"Freshman representative
Ji Suk Jin."

206
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:56,490
Lee Sang Yeob.

207
00:08:56,490 --> 00:08:57,750
Yang Se Chan.

208
00:08:57,750 --> 00:08:58,810
Kang Han Na.

209
00:08:58,810 --> 00:08:59,990
Jeon So Min.

210
00:09:00,050 --> 00:09:01,760
That's our freshman pledge.

211
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:03,280
(We will work hard.)

212
00:09:03,280 --> 00:09:05,390
- We'll work hard.
- We'll work hard.

213
00:09:05,390 --> 00:09:06,500
- All right.
- This is touching.

214
00:09:06,920 --> 00:09:08,130
Salute.

215
00:09:08,730 --> 00:09:10,630
I used to be like them too.

216
00:09:10,630 --> 00:09:12,630
- I used my superpower well.
- Good job.

217
00:09:12,630 --> 00:09:14,140
(The freshmen are given
superpowers too.)

218
00:09:14,140 --> 00:09:15,270
Hello.

219
00:09:15,970 --> 00:09:17,840
(Freshman Se Chan enters.)

220
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:19,770
(Excited)

221
00:09:19,770 --> 00:09:21,030
I should drink my potion first.

222
00:09:21,300 --> 00:09:22,800
I've been waiting for this moment.

223
00:09:24,380 --> 00:09:26,980
"You are the Poison Needle
Sorcerer."

224
00:09:26,980 --> 00:09:28,220
"Shoot a member's name tag,"

225
00:09:28,220 --> 00:09:30,850
"and he or she will be paralyzed
after 15 seconds."

226
00:09:30,850 --> 00:09:32,520
(The paralysis lasts
for 30 seconds,)

227
00:09:32,520 --> 00:09:34,410
(preventing the member
from any action except rolling.)

228
00:09:36,260 --> 00:09:38,950
(The computer graphics
are not in yet.)

229
00:09:39,820 --> 00:09:43,190
(The freshman is too excited
to wait for the computer graphics.)

230
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:48,470
(Here come the computer graphics.)

231
00:09:50,060 --> 00:09:53,240
(He enjoys the graphics
to the fullest.)

232
00:09:53,380 --> 00:09:54,510
My name is Se Chan.

233
00:09:55,270 --> 00:09:56,440
I'm a shooter.

234
00:09:56,850 --> 00:09:59,170
(Poison Needle Sorcerer)

235
00:09:59,170 --> 00:10:01,480
(A poison needle paralyzes you
after 15 seconds,)

236
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:03,810
(only allowing you to roll
for 30 seconds.)

237
00:10:04,680 --> 00:10:07,490
(The next freshman is So Min.)

238
00:10:07,950 --> 00:10:09,860
"You are the Wizard
of Push and Pull."

239
00:10:10,590 --> 00:10:13,000
(Giggling)

240
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,400
Is this really a superpower?

241
00:10:16,290 --> 00:10:20,600
"Shout, 'Go, go, push!'"
"at a member,"

242
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:22,770
"and he or she will be pushed away."

243
00:10:23,160 --> 00:10:25,510
"Shout, 'Come, come, pull!'"

244
00:10:25,510 --> 00:10:27,840
"and he or she will be
pulled toward you."

245
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:32,700
"As soon as you breathe,
the member can move freely."

246
00:10:32,700 --> 00:10:34,440
"So try to hold your breath
as long as you can."

247
00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:38,180
(Enthusiastic)

248
00:10:39,310 --> 00:10:43,090
Go, go, push!

249
00:10:43,090 --> 00:10:44,490
Like that? Or...

250
00:10:46,950 --> 00:10:48,450
(After fancy preparatory moves...)

251
00:10:48,450 --> 00:10:50,060
Come, come, come!

252
00:10:50,060 --> 00:10:51,920
(The spell is wrong.)

253
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:53,000
Oh, is it "pull"?

254
00:10:53,740 --> 00:10:56,510
- It's "push" and "pull".
- Right. "Push" and "pull".

255
00:10:57,470 --> 00:10:59,240
Okay. This is nice.

256
00:10:59,700 --> 00:11:00,840
Will this give me a superpower?

257
00:11:00,840 --> 00:11:04,700
(She drinks her potion to become
the Witch of Push and Pull.)

258
00:11:10,590 --> 00:11:11,650
Go, go,

259
00:11:11,650 --> 00:11:18,630
push!

260
00:11:18,630 --> 00:11:21,020
(The cameraman is pushed away.)

261
00:11:22,420 --> 00:11:25,970
(Her superpower is so effective
that it even affects the cameramen.)

262
00:11:26,190 --> 00:11:27,430
Okay, I like it.

263
00:11:27,770 --> 00:11:29,000
Can I try it one more time?

264
00:11:29,560 --> 00:11:30,660
Come, come,

265
00:11:31,030 --> 00:11:32,770
pull!

266
00:11:32,770 --> 00:11:35,270
(Push or pull a member
by saying spells.)

267
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:36,480
"You are..."

268
00:11:37,400 --> 00:11:39,610
"the Past Life Summoner."

269
00:11:40,170 --> 00:11:41,650
"When you're eliminated,"

270
00:11:42,250 --> 00:11:44,220
"lift the bundle..."

271
00:11:45,390 --> 00:11:46,760
This is it.

272
00:11:47,520 --> 00:11:49,120
I still...

273
00:11:49,280 --> 00:11:51,890
have a death.

274
00:11:51,890 --> 00:11:53,290
(His spell is wrong.)

275
00:11:55,450 --> 00:11:57,270
(Past Life Summoner)

276
00:11:57,270 --> 00:12:02,140
(You can be born again
in the form of your past life.)

277
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:04,560
Mirror, mirror,

278
00:12:05,010 --> 00:12:06,480
who do I look like?

279
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:09,670
"Is it wrong to fall in love?"

280
00:12:09,670 --> 00:12:11,610
(Doing an impression turns you into
him or her for three minutes.)

281
00:12:12,650 --> 00:12:13,770
Drop the beat.

282
00:12:14,070 --> 00:12:16,850
(After saying, "Drop the beat",
dance for 30 seconds.)

283
00:12:16,850 --> 00:12:19,590
(Everyone who sees you dance
will go blind...)

284
00:12:19,590 --> 00:12:22,150
(and have trouble seeing
for a minute.)

285
00:12:23,230 --> 00:12:26,050
- You've all been given superpowers.
- Yes.

286
00:12:26,050 --> 00:12:29,100
Running Man's 10th anniversary
special is only 3 weeks away.

287
00:12:29,450 --> 00:12:31,470
That day,

288
00:12:31,470 --> 00:12:33,160
we will go live...

289
00:12:33,160 --> 00:12:34,930
- at the end of the race.
- On a Sunday?

290
00:12:34,930 --> 00:12:36,030
What?

291
00:12:36,270 --> 00:12:38,240
(A live broadcast
to celebrate the 10th anniversary)

292
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:39,640
A live broadcast?

293
00:12:39,640 --> 00:12:41,030
For the next two weeks,

294
00:12:41,030 --> 00:12:44,800
to decide who will be penalized live
on our 10th anniversary special,

295
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:48,170
we will have two races chosen
by our viewers as their favorites.

296
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:52,180
Our viewers' number one favorite
turns out to be...

297
00:12:52,180 --> 00:12:53,450
War of Superpowers.

298
00:12:54,090 --> 00:12:55,950
- This was a fun one.
- I enjoyed it too.

299
00:12:55,950 --> 00:12:57,150
The Keeper of Time!

300
00:12:57,150 --> 00:13:00,360
(The Superhero Race
led the show into glory.)

301
00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:03,600
(It was probably too childish
for the average viewer.)

302
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:07,400
(The race featured
B-rated computer graphics.)

303
00:13:07,400 --> 00:13:10,140
(The viewers asked,
and we answered.)

304
00:13:10,140 --> 00:13:12,300
(10th Anniversary Specials)

305
00:13:12,300 --> 00:13:14,700
(It will lead to a live show
on July 12.)

306
00:13:14,700 --> 00:13:17,900
Therefore, we welcome you
to the Superpower School Race.

307
00:13:18,610 --> 00:13:21,520
The last man standing
will become the final winner.

308
00:13:21,850 --> 00:13:25,180
The one chosen by the winner
will receive the penalty...

309
00:13:25,180 --> 00:13:26,680
during the live show.

310
00:13:26,680 --> 00:13:28,220
(The winner will choose 1 person
to receive the penalty.)

311
00:13:28,220 --> 00:13:30,920
(Then we need to win
no matter what.)

312
00:13:31,490 --> 00:13:34,020
The guests will receive a prize
if they win...

313
00:13:34,020 --> 00:13:36,660
or a penalty if they lose.

314
00:13:36,730 --> 00:13:39,020
The details will be revealed
at the end of the race.

315
00:13:39,630 --> 00:13:41,100
Before we begin the actual race,

316
00:13:41,100 --> 00:13:43,770
you'll compete in
a preliminary mission.

317
00:13:43,870 --> 00:13:45,660
You will split into 5 teams of 2...

318
00:13:45,660 --> 00:13:47,530
that consist of
a mentor and mentee.

319
00:13:47,880 --> 00:13:51,010
Points will be handed out
depending on how you do.

320
00:13:51,850 --> 00:13:53,720
The points you receive...

321
00:13:53,720 --> 00:13:55,150
will affect the number of times...

322
00:13:55,150 --> 00:13:56,750
you'll be allowed
to use your superpowers.

323
00:13:57,020 --> 00:13:59,520
So doing well in this mission
will be crucial.

324
00:13:59,520 --> 00:14:01,260
- Got it.
- The mentors must do well.

325
00:14:01,260 --> 00:14:02,760
- How about this?
- It's all down to the mentors.

326
00:14:02,760 --> 00:14:04,780
We've already
chosen your teams for you.

327
00:14:04,780 --> 00:14:05,890
- What?
- Really?

328
00:14:05,890 --> 00:14:06,900
Team One.

329
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:09,100
Yoo Jae Suk...

330
00:14:09,690 --> 00:14:11,160
and Kang Han Na.

331
00:14:11,820 --> 00:14:13,100
- Han Na.
- I hope we get along.

332
00:14:13,100 --> 00:14:14,690
- Be good to him.
- Strong Han Na, Weak Han Na.

333
00:14:14,690 --> 00:14:16,370
Han Na, come this way.

334
00:14:16,370 --> 00:14:17,370
She seems like an excellent student.

335
00:14:17,370 --> 00:14:18,840
Han Na's finally moving out
from under my shadow.

336
00:14:18,840 --> 00:14:20,170
I should use this chance
to learn from the best.

337
00:14:20,900 --> 00:14:22,380
- She was always...
- Team Two.

338
00:14:22,380 --> 00:14:23,700
We have a good chance of winning.

339
00:14:23,800 --> 00:14:25,300
I'm partnered with a true mentor.

340
00:14:25,300 --> 00:14:26,850
(Superpower School)

341
00:14:27,270 --> 00:14:28,350
We're playing the limbo game.

342
00:14:28,350 --> 00:14:31,490
- I'm not good at that.
- We're not on the flexible side.

343
00:14:31,490 --> 00:14:32,590
My mentor, come this way.

344
00:14:32,590 --> 00:14:33,590
Your mentor?

345
00:14:34,050 --> 00:14:35,120
Who's the mentor?

346
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:36,680
- Kwang Soo is.
- We...

347
00:14:36,680 --> 00:14:38,360
He's not directly above us though.

348
00:14:38,360 --> 00:14:40,050
- But...
- I remember my freshman years.

349
00:14:41,130 --> 00:14:43,660
He's the senior
because he joined before us.

350
00:14:43,770 --> 00:14:45,020
Does that look like
an ordinary pole to you?

351
00:14:45,190 --> 00:14:47,400
- Kwang-tor.
- Kwang-tor?

352
00:14:47,400 --> 00:14:48,530
(He's the easiest type to tease.)

353
00:14:48,530 --> 00:14:49,600
- Kwang-tor.
- Are you saying...

354
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:50,640
that this is no ordinary limbo game?

355
00:14:51,700 --> 00:14:53,380
Please let us know.
If you tell us in advance...

356
00:14:53,510 --> 00:14:55,480
Consider the bigger picture here.

357
00:14:55,480 --> 00:14:56,800
- As in what?
- See the paint over there?

358
00:14:58,270 --> 00:15:01,520
(There are five colors of paint
on the other side of the room.)

359
00:15:01,520 --> 00:15:03,850
Will we be playing the game
with paint on our faces?

360
00:15:03,850 --> 00:15:05,090
(No way.)

361
00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:08,120
- I see you don't know.
- Are you sure?

362
00:15:08,120 --> 00:15:09,890
- Are you sure?
- We'll be holding the paint.

363
00:15:09,890 --> 00:15:11,760
But someone could slip and get hurt.

364
00:15:12,780 --> 00:15:14,050
That's the fun of it.

365
00:15:14,760 --> 00:15:16,320
(Getting injured is fun?)

366
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:17,630
He's a clueless mentor.

367
00:15:17,630 --> 00:15:18,790
- Ji Hyo.
- That's the fun of it.

368
00:15:18,790 --> 00:15:20,140
- Ji Hyo.
- I bet she's clueless.

369
00:15:20,140 --> 00:15:21,790
- Ji Hyo.
- She won't know a thing.

370
00:15:21,790 --> 00:15:23,300
- What? Of course, I know.
- She doesn't know anything.

371
00:15:23,300 --> 00:15:24,740
- She's clueless.
- Then...

372
00:15:24,740 --> 00:15:26,400
Ji Hyo, do you know
the rule of this game?

373
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:28,530
- The rule? It's a limbo game.
- She doesn't know.

374
00:15:28,530 --> 00:15:30,770
See? She doesn't know a thing.

375
00:15:30,770 --> 00:15:32,610
- It's a limbo game.
- That's right.

376
00:15:32,700 --> 00:15:34,480
You will compete in a mission...

377
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:36,350
to earn more chances
to use your superpower.

378
00:15:36,410 --> 00:15:38,620
The game is called
Walking with a Third Eye.

379
00:15:39,280 --> 00:15:42,860
The runner will put on gloves
and a blindfold.

380
00:15:42,860 --> 00:15:44,360
After spinning
five times on the spot,

381
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:45,590
he or she will try...

382
00:15:45,590 --> 00:15:47,900
and plant handprints
beyond the limbo pole.

383
00:15:47,900 --> 00:15:50,370
Each team will start
with five points.

384
00:15:50,370 --> 00:15:52,400
You will earn an extra point
for every 2m,

385
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:53,840
but a point will be deducted...

386
00:15:53,840 --> 00:15:55,530
if you fail to move past
the starting line.

387
00:15:55,530 --> 00:15:58,140
You will earn two points
for a handprint on the floor.

388
00:15:58,140 --> 00:16:01,170
Two points will be deducted though
if you place them elsewhere.

389
00:16:01,170 --> 00:16:02,900
The points you receive
will determine...

390
00:16:02,900 --> 00:16:04,650
the number of times
you can use your superpower.

391
00:16:04,650 --> 00:16:06,510
- Right.
- Can we help our teammates?

392
00:16:06,510 --> 00:16:07,750
No, you must not talk.

393
00:16:08,040 --> 00:16:09,380
You're not allowed
to guide your teammate.

394
00:16:09,380 --> 00:16:11,490
What's there to worry about
when we have superpowers?

395
00:16:11,990 --> 00:16:13,120
You idiots.

396
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:14,990
But what's with the third eye?

397
00:16:14,990 --> 00:16:16,360
(The game begins with Haha
fully absorbed in his character.)

398
00:16:16,360 --> 00:16:18,130
- Not both hands?
- No, just the one.

399
00:16:18,280 --> 00:16:19,890
And you have to spin on the spot.

400
00:16:19,890 --> 00:16:21,100
- In university...
- Gosh.

401
00:16:21,150 --> 00:16:22,920
- So Min, you're up.
- You've got this.

402
00:16:22,920 --> 00:16:24,320
- You're ready.
- Put on your blindfold.

403
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:26,520
You can do this.
Do I put this on her?

404
00:16:26,790 --> 00:16:28,870
Do you guys major in sports?

405
00:16:29,240 --> 00:16:31,030
- Is this comfortable?
- He must major in sports.

406
00:16:31,030 --> 00:16:32,240
- Are you good?
- Yes.

407
00:16:32,930 --> 00:16:34,270
- Okay.
- Ready!

408
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:36,010
- So Min, your hair looks nice.
- Get set.

409
00:16:36,010 --> 00:16:37,250
(The goal is to place a handprint
the furthest as possible.)

410
00:16:37,250 --> 00:16:38,440
- It's better to speed up.
- That's right.

411
00:16:38,540 --> 00:16:39,880
- One.
- Faster.

412
00:16:39,880 --> 00:16:41,350
- Faster!
- Two.

413
00:16:41,350 --> 00:16:42,750
- Three.
- Faster.

414
00:16:42,750 --> 00:16:44,310
- Pick up the pace.
- Faster, So Min.

415
00:16:44,310 --> 00:16:45,680
- Five.
- Off you go.

416
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:46,780
Go ahead.

417
00:16:46,780 --> 00:16:49,220
- Get going already!
- The game ends with a handprint.

418
00:16:49,220 --> 00:16:50,630
(So Min takes cautious steps.)

419
00:16:50,860 --> 00:16:52,230
Watch out for the camera.

420
00:16:53,230 --> 00:16:54,820
(Watch out for the camera.)

421
00:16:55,500 --> 00:16:56,630
Beware of the camera.

422
00:16:57,420 --> 00:16:59,820
(Is it this way?)

423
00:16:59,820 --> 00:17:01,290
12, 13.

424
00:17:02,370 --> 00:17:04,030
12, 13.

425
00:17:06,010 --> 00:17:08,010
(Why is she headed this way?)

426
00:17:09,530 --> 00:17:10,610
Who's there?

427
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:13,350
(Swipe!)

428
00:17:13,880 --> 00:17:14,910
Who's there?

429
00:17:15,440 --> 00:17:17,350
(Jae Suk let her hand
touch his face.)

430
00:17:19,320 --> 00:17:20,790
This is the spot.

431
00:17:20,890 --> 00:17:23,480
She touched Jae Suk's face
right here.

432
00:17:23,480 --> 00:17:25,130
- Over here.
- You smacked a mentor.

433
00:17:25,130 --> 00:17:26,560
Place your handprint here.

434
00:17:26,560 --> 00:17:28,250
- Go on.
- How dare you smack a mentor.

435
00:17:28,250 --> 00:17:30,300
So where her handprint landed...

436
00:17:30,300 --> 00:17:31,300
That was hilarious.

437
00:17:31,300 --> 00:17:32,300
She came a long way though.

438
00:17:32,300 --> 00:17:34,570
What's fascinating is that
I touched something sharp.

439
00:17:34,570 --> 00:17:35,690
Something sharp?

440
00:17:35,690 --> 00:17:37,500
- It was his protruding teeth.
- It was really sharp.

441
00:17:37,500 --> 00:17:39,900
- His protruding teeth.
- What do you mean it was sharp?

442
00:17:39,900 --> 00:17:41,540
You look like Young Gu or Ppak Gu.

443
00:17:41,540 --> 00:17:43,000
- Ppak Gu.
- Ppak Gu?

444
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,000
Yes, Ppak Gu.

445
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:45,500
- This isn't at all pleasant.
- I know.

446
00:17:45,500 --> 00:17:46,910
Haha, please let go of him.

447
00:17:46,910 --> 00:17:48,620
- Let's go!
- You can't say anything.

448
00:17:52,090 --> 00:17:53,090
I'm dizzy.

449
00:17:53,090 --> 00:17:54,210
It does make you dizzy.

450
00:17:54,210 --> 00:17:55,250
(After spinning just once?)

451
00:17:55,250 --> 00:17:56,590
- Two.
- Gosh, I'm dizzy.

452
00:17:56,590 --> 00:17:57,860
- Five.
- My head's spinning.

453
00:17:58,680 --> 00:18:00,750
- I'm too dizzy.
- Off he goes.

454
00:18:00,750 --> 00:18:01,920
There he goes.

455
00:18:02,030 --> 00:18:04,130
- He's off.
- Gosh, I'm dizzy.

456
00:18:04,130 --> 00:18:05,690
(Where is he headed?)

457
00:18:05,690 --> 00:18:06,990
- He's off.
- Gosh, I'm dizzy.

458
00:18:06,990 --> 00:18:07,990
(He's completely off course.)

459
00:18:07,990 --> 00:18:09,730
My world's spinning.

460
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:11,960
- What now?
- He's going that way.

461
00:18:12,460 --> 00:18:13,810
I thought he'd come this way.

462
00:18:13,810 --> 00:18:15,730
I'm too dizzy.

463
00:18:16,380 --> 00:18:18,310
- What's this?
- You made contact!

464
00:18:19,880 --> 00:18:22,550
(His turn ends
under the flashy light.)

465
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:25,150
- The light.
- Over there.

466
00:18:25,350 --> 00:18:26,390
What on earth?

467
00:18:27,250 --> 00:18:28,950
- I thought I was walking forward.
- I mean...

468
00:18:28,950 --> 00:18:30,830
The Keeper of Time!

469
00:18:32,220 --> 00:18:34,250
The mentees look like
they need guidance.

470
00:18:34,250 --> 00:18:35,600
- I can't believe I headed that way.
- You did well.

471
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:37,990
And go.

472
00:18:37,990 --> 00:18:39,160
Guys, please step back.

473
00:18:39,220 --> 00:18:40,870
- Gosh.
- That's fast. Go for it.

474
00:18:40,870 --> 00:18:41,870
Three.

475
00:18:41,870 --> 00:18:42,870
- Four.
- Goodness.

476
00:18:42,870 --> 00:18:44,260
You can't clap.

477
00:18:45,430 --> 00:18:47,140
(After five quick spins,
she heads off.)

478
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:50,810
(Searching route)

479
00:18:51,940 --> 00:18:53,470
(How she does will decide...)

480
00:18:53,470 --> 00:18:55,210
(the number of times Jae Suk
can use his superpower.)

481
00:18:56,510 --> 00:18:58,010
(What?)

482
00:18:58,010 --> 00:18:59,550
She has a good balance.

483
00:18:59,550 --> 00:19:01,120
(Is she already
playing the limbo game?)

484
00:19:01,750 --> 00:19:03,090
(You're not quite there yet.)

485
00:19:03,090 --> 00:19:04,360
She's already playing
the limbo game.

486
00:19:05,330 --> 00:19:06,750
(An error has occurred.)

487
00:19:06,750 --> 00:19:07,920
No way.

488
00:19:08,860 --> 00:19:10,630
She's doing a great job.

489
00:19:10,800 --> 00:19:11,900
Right there.

490
00:19:12,420 --> 00:19:13,460
Right there.

491
00:19:13,460 --> 00:19:14,460
(She can feel where the mat ends.)

492
00:19:14,460 --> 00:19:15,690
Just a little to the side.

493
00:19:16,260 --> 00:19:17,340
To the side.

494
00:19:17,340 --> 00:19:19,730
(She thinks she's
at the end of the mat.)

495
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,540
- Han Na, no!
- How did I do?

496
00:19:22,540 --> 00:19:24,550
- Is she done?
- Tell me how I did.

497
00:19:24,550 --> 00:19:26,080
- Why did you stop there?
- Where am I?

498
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:27,850
That was awesome.

499
00:19:27,850 --> 00:19:29,710
- Why...
- I knew she'd fail.

500
00:19:29,820 --> 00:19:30,910
Flimsy as always.

501
00:19:30,910 --> 00:19:32,120
You failed.

502
00:19:32,120 --> 00:19:33,150
(Jae Suk and Han Na
score 9 points in total.)

503
00:19:33,150 --> 00:19:35,090
The mentees can't seem
to do this right.

504
00:19:35,090 --> 00:19:36,290
Unbelievable.

505
00:19:36,290 --> 00:19:38,060
I should show them how it's done.

506
00:19:38,060 --> 00:19:39,830
I bet he'll do a good job.

507
00:19:40,030 --> 00:19:41,830
Why are you all bad at this game?

508
00:19:43,720 --> 00:19:44,720
Get ready.

509
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:47,230
(Se Chan will represent
and show them how it's done.)

510
00:19:48,300 --> 00:19:49,370
Three.

511
00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:52,810
(Se Chan is good
when it comes to games.)

512
00:19:52,810 --> 00:19:56,700
(It's why everyone
watches silently.)

513
00:19:57,580 --> 00:19:58,880
Unbelievable.

514
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:00,650
I should show them how it's done.

515
00:20:00,650 --> 00:20:04,090
(Will he able to proudly
represent the mentees?)

516
00:20:04,090 --> 00:20:05,650
(What?)

517
00:20:09,150 --> 00:20:12,390
(He bows down to his seniors.)

518
00:20:13,390 --> 00:20:16,030
(It serves you right
for being overly confident.)

519
00:20:16,250 --> 00:20:18,130
Oh, no. He fell there.

520
00:20:20,930 --> 00:20:22,100
I was too dizzy.

521
00:20:24,230 --> 00:20:25,310
My world is spinning.

522
00:20:25,310 --> 00:20:26,310
(Are you kidding me?)

523
00:20:26,310 --> 00:20:27,640
I was too dizzy.

524
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:29,380
I'm not kidding.

525
00:20:29,380 --> 00:20:30,850
(He was able
to make them laugh though.)

526
00:20:30,850 --> 00:20:32,170
Good.

527
00:20:32,170 --> 00:20:33,650
- It's all good.
- I was too dizzy.

528
00:20:33,780 --> 00:20:35,710
It was like
that comedy skit, "Master".

529
00:20:36,150 --> 00:20:37,180
"Get out of here!"

530
00:20:37,620 --> 00:20:39,150
- What on earth was that?
- You looked cool though.

531
00:20:39,390 --> 00:20:40,410
Se Chan, seriously?

532
00:20:40,410 --> 00:20:42,320
(The teams that were tied
played again.)

533
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:44,650
Jae Suk and Han Na...

534
00:20:44,750 --> 00:20:46,950
- earned nine points.
- Okay!

535
00:20:47,250 --> 00:20:49,450
With the points you earned,

536
00:20:49,450 --> 00:20:51,490
you can buy how many times
you can use your superpower.

537
00:20:52,160 --> 00:20:53,640
The rule of distribution is simple.

538
00:20:53,690 --> 00:20:57,160
Distribute the numbers
on three cards.

539
00:20:57,160 --> 00:20:59,370
What your mentee picks
will be the mentee's points.

540
00:20:59,370 --> 00:21:01,470
The next card chosen
will be discarded.

541
00:21:01,470 --> 00:21:03,110
- The last one is the mentor's.
- Got it.

542
00:21:03,610 --> 00:21:04,810
Per two points,

543
00:21:04,810 --> 00:21:06,780
you will get an extra chance
to use your superpower.

544
00:21:06,780 --> 00:21:08,550
(4 points equal to 2 extra chances.)

545
00:21:08,550 --> 00:21:10,550
- So Han Na...
- Yes?

546
00:21:10,550 --> 00:21:12,390
You know I never play dirty.

547
00:21:12,390 --> 00:21:13,750
Let's share it fairly.

548
00:21:13,750 --> 00:21:15,320
I'll write 5 and 4.

549
00:21:15,320 --> 00:21:16,820
- 5 and 4.
- 5, 4, and 0?

550
00:21:17,130 --> 00:21:18,890
- I mean...
- Betrayal isn't all that bad.

551
00:21:18,890 --> 00:21:20,450
We have enough points to go around,

552
00:21:20,450 --> 00:21:22,220
- so there's no need to play dirty.
- Right.

553
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:24,720
- He plays dirty too.
- 5, 4, and 0.

554
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:25,920
That's right.

555
00:21:25,920 --> 00:21:27,840
5, 4, 0. Which one has 0?

556
00:21:27,990 --> 00:21:29,140
Zero?

557
00:21:29,640 --> 00:21:31,310
Card number one.

558
00:21:31,310 --> 00:21:32,660
Then 5 and 4 respectively.

559
00:21:33,140 --> 00:21:34,430
Card number 1 has 0 written on it?

560
00:21:34,610 --> 00:21:36,500
You seem nervous though.

561
00:21:36,670 --> 00:21:39,200
- Card number 1 has 0?
- You shouldn't choose it.

562
00:21:39,970 --> 00:21:41,280
- Then...
- Yes?

563
00:21:42,580 --> 00:21:45,010
- Please don't.
- Let him have that instead.

564
00:21:45,320 --> 00:21:46,410
She hasn't seen it yet.

565
00:21:46,410 --> 00:21:47,510
She hasn't looked.

566
00:21:47,510 --> 00:21:48,790
I wrote zero on that.

567
00:21:49,180 --> 00:21:50,630
But...

568
00:21:51,790 --> 00:21:53,030
Really?

569
00:21:53,030 --> 00:21:54,100
(Han Na choose card number 1.)

570
00:21:54,100 --> 00:21:55,150
You're really taking that?

571
00:21:55,150 --> 00:21:56,900
- Don't you trust me?
- Take a look.

572
00:21:56,900 --> 00:21:58,800
(Han Na trusted
her instincts instead.)

573
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:02,370
(9 points!)

574
00:22:03,040 --> 00:22:04,760
(I'm doomed!)

575
00:22:05,040 --> 00:22:06,260
Seriously?

576
00:22:06,260 --> 00:22:07,780
(Jae Suk ends up with 0 points.)

577
00:22:07,780 --> 00:22:09,900
- It's her superpower!
- That leaves him with nothing.

578
00:22:09,900 --> 00:22:11,610
Han Na, you're unbelievable.

579
00:22:11,610 --> 00:22:12,810
- That was insane.
- Did she understand the rule?

580
00:22:12,810 --> 00:22:14,240
Jae Suk, I've got
to hand it to you too.

581
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:15,510
He has zero points then.

582
00:22:15,510 --> 00:22:16,940
Of course, I trust Jong Kook.

583
00:22:16,940 --> 00:22:18,820
- How can you not?
- I trust you completely.

584
00:22:18,820 --> 00:22:20,120
Just do as I say.

585
00:22:20,120 --> 00:22:23,390
I'll write 0 on card number 2.

586
00:22:23,390 --> 00:22:26,030
On card number 3, I'll write down 4.

587
00:22:26,030 --> 00:22:28,030
- He'll write down four.
- What? Wait. Hold on a second.

588
00:22:28,030 --> 00:22:29,330
4 on card number 3?

589
00:22:29,330 --> 00:22:30,530
I saw him write a zero.

590
00:22:30,530 --> 00:22:32,630
I'll write two on the last one.

591
00:22:33,190 --> 00:22:35,100
- See? It's just like I said.
- You can't show her.

592
00:22:35,100 --> 00:22:36,900
- Wait and see what So Min does.
- "Wait and see."

593
00:22:36,900 --> 00:22:38,000
(We all look forward
to So Min's choice.)

594
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:39,200
- Is this four?
- Yes.

595
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:40,840
- Are you sure?
- Of course.

596
00:22:40,840 --> 00:22:42,140
You promised, remember?

597
00:22:42,140 --> 00:22:43,610
(Thanks to Jong Kook's honesty,
So Min received 4 points.)

598
00:22:43,610 --> 00:22:45,440
- Please choose the next one.
- You guys are all nice.

599
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:47,120
This is how we normally are.

600
00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:48,280
- Of course.
- We're one big team here.

601
00:22:48,820 --> 00:22:50,050
Look at her eyes.

602
00:22:50,050 --> 00:22:52,290
Come on.
Choose the right one for me.

603
00:22:52,290 --> 00:22:53,590
- Did you write two on this?
- Yes.

604
00:22:53,590 --> 00:22:54,650
- 0?
- 0. Yes.

605
00:22:54,650 --> 00:22:56,150
You can throw one away.

606
00:22:56,710 --> 00:22:57,860
You really are...

607
00:22:57,860 --> 00:23:00,090
(He said number 1 was 2 points,
but she threw away number 1.)

608
00:23:00,420 --> 00:23:02,250
(His anger explodes.)

609
00:23:02,250 --> 00:23:04,130
- That's right.
- He's really angry.

610
00:23:04,460 --> 00:23:05,720
Run away, So Min.

611
00:23:05,720 --> 00:23:06,920
That's how So Min is.

612
00:23:06,920 --> 00:23:08,160
This is what you meant.

613
00:23:08,160 --> 00:23:09,260
She's like a poison mushroom.

614
00:23:09,490 --> 00:23:11,310
- I told you.
- The strongest member came out.

615
00:23:11,310 --> 00:23:12,870
I should've done this.

616
00:23:13,260 --> 00:23:14,810
My head hurts already.

617
00:23:15,080 --> 00:23:16,580
All of them are zero, but...

618
00:23:16,580 --> 00:23:17,580
All of them are?

619
00:23:17,580 --> 00:23:19,150
- He's going to do 4, 0, 0 for sure.
- Can I see it?

620
00:23:19,150 --> 00:23:21,350
Yes. Take 2 and leave 2.

621
00:23:21,710 --> 00:23:23,080
I'll show it to you.

622
00:23:23,080 --> 00:23:24,410
- Seriously.
- You're going to write 2 and 2?

623
00:23:24,410 --> 00:23:25,590
You're going to let him see you
write it down?

624
00:23:25,590 --> 00:23:26,710
You're going to let me
see you write it. Show me.

625
00:23:27,980 --> 00:23:30,590
(He will write it down
in front of him.)

626
00:23:31,650 --> 00:23:32,950
- It's true.
- He's writing 2, 0, 2.

627
00:23:32,950 --> 00:23:33,950
Seriously.

628
00:23:33,950 --> 00:23:34,950
(Did he keep his promise?)

629
00:23:34,950 --> 00:23:35,950
Seriously.

630
00:23:36,360 --> 00:23:37,830
- And then he's mixing it.
- He's mixing it up.

631
00:23:37,830 --> 00:23:40,370
- It's like he's doing magic.
- He's mixing it up.

632
00:23:40,370 --> 00:23:41,460
(It looks like he's mixing them up.)

633
00:23:41,460 --> 00:23:42,490
Are you mixing them up?

634
00:23:42,490 --> 00:23:43,640
- Hey, you fool.
- Hey.

635
00:23:43,640 --> 00:23:44,730
- There are numbers in the back.
- Hey.

636
00:23:44,730 --> 00:23:46,200
- There are numbers in the back?
- There are...

637
00:23:46,500 --> 00:23:48,580
You fool. Stop mixing them.

638
00:23:48,580 --> 00:23:50,230
I showed it to you.

639
00:23:50,280 --> 00:23:51,310
Then...

640
00:23:52,810 --> 00:23:55,280
I really showed it to you.
What's wrong?

641
00:23:55,780 --> 00:23:58,090
Really? He's telling the truth.

642
00:23:58,090 --> 00:23:59,290
- I'm telling the truth.
- I thought he had other cards...

643
00:23:59,290 --> 00:24:00,480
hidden in his pocket.

644
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:02,180
- No way.
- Then it's 2, 0, 2.

645
00:24:02,180 --> 00:24:03,790
- Yes.
- It's 2, 0, 2.

646
00:24:03,790 --> 00:24:05,220
I saw him write 2, 0, 2.

647
00:24:05,220 --> 00:24:06,330
- That's what he wrote.
- I showed it to you.

648
00:24:06,330 --> 00:24:07,330
I saw it too.

649
00:24:07,330 --> 00:24:08,530
I'll take 2 then.

650
00:24:12,070 --> 00:24:13,960
- I'll take 2.
- Okay.

651
00:24:14,540 --> 00:24:15,800
(What?)

652
00:24:17,960 --> 00:24:19,460
(Why does it say 4 points here?)

653
00:24:19,460 --> 00:24:20,500
Okay!

654
00:24:20,500 --> 00:24:22,080
- You are...
- Seriously.

655
00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:24,350
- You're too much.
- He overthought it.

656
00:24:25,350 --> 00:24:26,880
He overthought it.

657
00:24:27,050 --> 00:24:28,470
My goodness.

658
00:24:28,740 --> 00:24:31,390
(The results of the other teams'
distributions)

659
00:24:31,390 --> 00:24:32,390
(Han Na can use it 5 times.)

660
00:24:32,390 --> 00:24:33,440
(So Min, Suk Jin, Haha,
Se Chan can use it 3 times.)

661
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:34,590
(Jae Suk, Jong Kook, Kwang Soo,
Sang Yeob, Ji Hyo can use it once.)

662
00:24:34,890 --> 00:24:36,210
The results are interesting...

663
00:24:36,450 --> 00:24:39,720
because all the seniors have
zero points except for Haha.

664
00:24:41,400 --> 00:24:43,720
You guys have really good juniors.

665
00:24:43,720 --> 00:24:45,160
- They are really...
- That's right.

666
00:24:45,160 --> 00:24:46,760
Let's continue to overcome them!

667
00:24:47,490 --> 00:24:49,160
- This is the worst.
- Let's go, juniors!

668
00:24:49,160 --> 00:24:50,810
The seniors need to work harder.

669
00:24:50,810 --> 00:24:53,640
As a result,
Han Na has received four more...

670
00:24:53,640 --> 00:24:55,080
and has a total of five chances.

671
00:24:55,140 --> 00:24:57,170
The remaining members have 3 chances
or 1 chance.

672
00:24:57,170 --> 00:24:59,240
- I only have 1 chance.
- We'll move on...

673
00:24:59,240 --> 00:25:00,620
- to the location for the race.
- Yes!

674
00:25:00,620 --> 00:25:01,880
Goodness, Kang Han Na.

675
00:25:01,880 --> 00:25:03,580
(Let's go to the location
for the final race.)

676
00:25:04,440 --> 00:25:05,680
- Good job.
- Goodness.

677
00:25:05,680 --> 00:25:06,710
Good job, Han Na.

678
00:25:06,710 --> 00:25:07,980
- Who, me?
- It's nice and cool here.

679
00:25:07,980 --> 00:25:09,410
- You did a good job.
- Oh, for getting 9 to 0?

680
00:25:09,410 --> 00:25:10,410
You did well.

681
00:25:10,410 --> 00:25:12,450
Jae Suk had a weird look
on his face.

682
00:25:12,450 --> 00:25:14,150
- I see.
- It was a good game.

683
00:25:14,150 --> 00:25:16,860
We need to choose a representative
among the second years.

684
00:25:16,860 --> 00:25:17,900
- The rules are...
- What are they?

685
00:25:17,900 --> 00:25:19,330
When you get off the bus,
the juniors will...

686
00:25:19,330 --> 00:25:20,730
write down the name
of their favorite senior...

687
00:25:20,730 --> 00:25:21,800
and give us the ballot.

688
00:25:21,800 --> 00:25:22,960
- The juniors will do that?
- Yes.

689
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:24,000
The juniors will do that.

690
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:25,900
Is there some type of benefit
to the senior?

691
00:25:25,900 --> 00:25:27,780
- The senior chosen...
- A benefit.

692
00:25:27,780 --> 00:25:30,080
as the representative will be given
another chance.

693
00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:31,310
- Okay.
- Yes.

694
00:25:31,310 --> 00:25:32,580
We should hear the reasons why
we need to choose them.

695
00:25:32,580 --> 00:25:33,940
- If we look at it like this...
- Really?

696
00:25:33,940 --> 00:25:35,670
- That's right.
- Kwang Soo, I choose you.

697
00:25:35,670 --> 00:25:38,440
As you all know, I gave Han Na...

698
00:25:38,440 --> 00:25:39,620
nine points.

699
00:25:39,620 --> 00:25:41,980
- That's right. Wait.
- You tried to fake it.

700
00:25:41,980 --> 00:25:44,980
- You were trying to fool me.
- I'm talking about the results.

701
00:25:44,980 --> 00:25:47,060
Guys. Hey, everyone.

702
00:25:47,060 --> 00:25:48,690
- Who should be the representative?
- It's the representative.

703
00:25:48,690 --> 00:25:50,420
- Let's vote for one person.
- I agree.

704
00:25:50,800 --> 00:25:52,990
The way that I see it,

705
00:25:52,990 --> 00:25:55,990
I think that
the votes should go to...

706
00:25:55,990 --> 00:25:58,000
Excuse me.
Are you the leader of the juniors?

707
00:25:58,000 --> 00:25:59,200
- Yes, I am.
- Did they choose you?

708
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:00,340
- Yes, they did.
- I'm sorry,

709
00:26:00,340 --> 00:26:01,500
but the principal
should stay out of it.

710
00:26:01,500 --> 00:26:02,670
Stop speaking nonsense.

711
00:26:02,670 --> 00:26:04,150
- The students are talking.
- The way that I see it...

712
00:26:04,150 --> 00:26:05,380
- Everyone.
- Yes?

713
00:26:05,380 --> 00:26:06,670
Choose someone who's a bit slow.

714
00:26:06,670 --> 00:26:07,850
- Someone who's slow?
- Someone slow?

715
00:26:07,850 --> 00:26:09,470
- Someone who's easy to manipulate.
- Hey.

716
00:26:09,470 --> 00:26:10,590
- They should have good character.
- Suk Jin.

717
00:26:10,590 --> 00:26:13,180
- Yes? Did you call me?
- Honestly,

718
00:26:13,180 --> 00:26:16,090
you debuted after me
as a comedian, right?

719
00:26:16,090 --> 00:26:17,330
- That's right.
- Right.

720
00:26:17,360 --> 00:26:19,250
- Keep that in mind.
- Who's the junior?

721
00:26:19,250 --> 00:26:20,600
- Pardon?
- Who's the junior?

722
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:21,720
Why are you speaking casually
to your senior?

723
00:26:21,720 --> 00:26:22,900
- Suk Jin.
- Who's the junior?

724
00:26:22,900 --> 00:26:24,260
Suk Jin, don't write my name down.

725
00:26:24,260 --> 00:26:25,990
(Suk Jin,
don't write my name down.)

726
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:28,260
- Oh, my.
- Excuse me.

727
00:26:28,260 --> 00:26:29,900
Let's do it together.
Hang out with us.

728
00:26:29,900 --> 00:26:31,400
- Hey!
- Let's play together.

729
00:26:31,400 --> 00:26:32,400
- Hey!
- I choose Ji Hyo.

730
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:34,700
Don't you know that the juniors
have come together?

731
00:26:34,700 --> 00:26:35,970
- I'm leading them.
- We haven't done so yet.

732
00:26:35,970 --> 00:26:37,780
Who are you leading?
We aren't being led yet.

733
00:26:37,780 --> 00:26:39,200
- We aren't being led yet.
- Who said we are?

734
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:41,350
Juniors, raise your hand
if you will join me!

735
00:26:42,710 --> 00:26:44,320
- He's making me feel uncomfortable.
- What surprises me...

736
00:26:44,320 --> 00:26:46,620
is that he's a junior like us.

737
00:26:46,620 --> 00:26:47,860
- It's uncomfortable, right?
- But...

738
00:26:47,860 --> 00:26:49,650
- It surprises me.
- It's for our benefit.

739
00:26:49,950 --> 00:26:52,560
If you know my superpower,

740
00:26:52,590 --> 00:26:53,720
- First off,
- will you support me?

741
00:26:53,720 --> 00:26:55,400
- we must choose someone weak.
- Tell us.

742
00:26:55,400 --> 00:26:56,720
- I can help you.
- How?

743
00:26:56,720 --> 00:26:59,660
- I can give you more power.
- Power?

744
00:26:59,660 --> 00:27:00,900
- Stop lying.
- It's a lie.

745
00:27:00,900 --> 00:27:02,260
- Has there ever been...
- I'm telling the truth.

746
00:27:02,260 --> 00:27:03,870
something like that on Running Man?

747
00:27:03,870 --> 00:27:05,310
- He's going to be a burden.
- No, that's not true.

748
00:27:05,310 --> 00:27:06,460
- He's talking nonsense.
- I'm telling the truth.

749
00:27:06,460 --> 00:27:08,540
- Show us a motion about your power.
- A motion.

750
00:27:08,540 --> 00:27:10,310
- A motion about your power.
- I'll show you something.

751
00:27:10,310 --> 00:27:11,350
- A motion related to it.
- Here.

752
00:27:11,350 --> 00:27:12,500
- Your superpower.
- This is... Goodness.

753
00:27:12,500 --> 00:27:14,080
- What is that?
- Is it Thanos?

754
00:27:14,080 --> 00:27:15,580
- It must be Thanos.
- It's an offensive power.

755
00:27:15,580 --> 00:27:16,850
- This is...
- It's an offensive power.

756
00:27:16,850 --> 00:27:18,150
- He must kill at least half of us.
- Can he get rid of us?

757
00:27:18,150 --> 00:27:19,790
- Show us a motion.
- This is mine.

758
00:27:19,790 --> 00:27:22,060
I say something and do this
to the other person.

759
00:27:23,680 --> 00:27:25,530
(I will help you.)

760
00:27:25,530 --> 00:27:28,060
Forget it. Forget about it.

761
00:27:28,060 --> 00:27:29,990
- This is yours?
- Lee Kwang Soo, out!

762
00:27:29,990 --> 00:27:32,100
- Take him out.
- Can you tell he's a liar now?

763
00:27:32,100 --> 00:27:33,490
- I don't believe him.
- Did you see that?

764
00:27:33,490 --> 00:27:34,540
- Forget him.
- How can you not believe me?

765
00:27:34,540 --> 00:27:36,600
- Let's ignore that one.
- Yes, of course.

766
00:27:36,730 --> 00:27:38,340
(Thudding)

767
00:27:39,110 --> 00:27:40,900
- Gosh, that surprised me.
- Me too.

768
00:27:41,500 --> 00:27:44,310
Did you see that? Everyone was
surprised, but I kept my cool.

769
00:27:44,670 --> 00:27:46,080
- Hold on.
- You were the one to stay cool.

770
00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:47,580
We need some tissues.
Jae Suk peed his pants.

771
00:27:48,910 --> 00:27:49,970
(The elections for the class
representative is filled with lies.)

772
00:27:49,970 --> 00:27:52,290
- Am I wrong?
- Gosh, Kwang Soo.

773
00:27:52,590 --> 00:27:54,090
I found out something important.

774
00:27:54,090 --> 00:27:55,590
- He's trying to promote himself.
- Among the superpowers,

775
00:27:55,590 --> 00:27:57,060
there are some
that will help others and...

776
00:27:57,060 --> 00:27:58,590
- some that will help themselves.
- I have a power...

777
00:27:58,680 --> 00:28:00,800
that will help everyone.

778
00:28:00,900 --> 00:28:02,800
Don't you think our conversation
is really funny?

779
00:28:03,560 --> 00:28:04,690
He has a great superpower.

780
00:28:04,690 --> 00:28:06,070
(They suddenly broke out
of character.)

781
00:28:06,070 --> 00:28:07,990
- When he's 45.
- We're all being so serious.

782
00:28:07,990 --> 00:28:09,960
- We're wearing the same outfits.
- Some of us are in our 50s.

783
00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:11,810
- Han Na, I'm telling you...
- What superpower?

784
00:28:11,810 --> 00:28:13,430
- What R Coin?
- if I help you, you'll win.

785
00:28:13,430 --> 00:28:14,730
- Really?
- Of course.

786
00:28:14,780 --> 00:28:16,430
- You have to fill in your votes.
- Did you write it down?

787
00:28:16,430 --> 00:28:17,440
- Yes.
- Are you done?

788
00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:18,780
- Yes. Should we hand it in?
- Write it down.

789
00:28:18,780 --> 00:28:20,610
Here. I wrote it down.

790
00:28:20,610 --> 00:28:22,710
- Okay. I will announce the results.
- Okay.

791
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:24,550
The first vote goes to...

792
00:28:25,940 --> 00:28:27,290
- Yoo Jae Suk.
- Yes!

793
00:28:27,680 --> 00:28:29,480
- Who voted for him?
- Who chose Jae Suk?

794
00:28:29,480 --> 00:28:30,750
- Thank you.
- It must've been Han Na.

795
00:28:30,750 --> 00:28:32,480
- Who voted for him?
- The second vote goes to...

796
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:34,190
- Lee Kwang Soo.
- Okay!

797
00:28:34,190 --> 00:28:36,450
- Who chose him?
- I will help whoever chose me.

798
00:28:36,450 --> 00:28:37,900
- Who chose Kwang Soo?
- I'll do this for them.

799
00:28:37,900 --> 00:28:40,300
- I'll do this for them.
- He can't be the representative.

800
00:28:40,300 --> 00:28:42,100
- My goodness.
- The third vote goes to...

801
00:28:42,100 --> 00:28:43,160
Haha.

802
00:28:43,160 --> 00:28:44,810
- Someone voted for Haha?
- Who did?

803
00:28:44,810 --> 00:28:45,960
The fourth vote goes to...

804
00:28:46,500 --> 00:28:47,500
Yoo Jae Suk.

805
00:28:47,500 --> 00:28:48,540
(Yoo Jae Suk, 2 votes)

806
00:28:48,540 --> 00:28:49,880
The fifth vote goes to Yoo Jae Suk.

807
00:28:49,880 --> 00:28:51,310
- I knew it.
- Okay.

808
00:28:51,310 --> 00:28:52,670
- Thank you.
- Who voted for him?

809
00:28:52,670 --> 00:28:54,440
- Please help us.
- Han Na.

810
00:28:54,440 --> 00:28:57,050
I didn't expect more than two votes.

811
00:28:57,980 --> 00:28:59,410
Jong Kook's
true feelings just came out.

812
00:28:59,410 --> 00:29:00,890
Not a single person voted for me.

813
00:29:00,890 --> 00:29:01,890
(Not a single person voted for me.)

814
00:29:01,890 --> 00:29:02,950
You're right.

815
00:29:04,330 --> 00:29:06,090
My voice is coming back.

816
00:29:06,890 --> 00:29:10,720
I'm glad you're so in character
right now.

817
00:29:11,160 --> 00:29:12,960
- My goodness.
- It's like we really have powers.

818
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:13,960
My goodness.

819
00:29:13,990 --> 00:29:15,430
We're going someplace far.

820
00:29:15,800 --> 00:29:17,700
Aren't we going to Ilsan?

821
00:29:17,700 --> 00:29:21,500
The venue we had intended to go to
got canceled because of COVID-19,

822
00:29:21,500 --> 00:29:24,670
so we'll have our race at
Tanhyeon SBS.

823
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:28,970
(Tanhyeon SBS has become the mecca
of superpowers through many races.)

824
00:29:29,670 --> 00:29:31,850
(The Superpower Race
will be held here.)

825
00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:35,620
During our 10 years, the fans chose
this as something they want to see.

826
00:29:35,620 --> 00:29:36,790
It's meaningful.

827
00:29:36,790 --> 00:29:38,150
- Yes.
- We finally get to use our powers.

828
00:29:38,150 --> 00:29:39,290
It will be meaningful to win today.

829
00:29:39,290 --> 00:29:41,420
It is the War of Superpowers:
The End Game.

830
00:29:41,420 --> 00:29:42,630
- The End Game.
- The End Game.

831
00:29:42,630 --> 00:29:45,300
It will be a huge honor
to be the winner this week.

832
00:29:45,300 --> 00:29:46,400
- It's an honor.
- Seriously.

833
00:29:46,400 --> 00:29:49,800
Use your powers to rip off
the other members' name tags.

834
00:29:49,800 --> 00:29:53,310
The winner will be
the last man standing.

835
00:29:53,310 --> 00:29:56,200
However, you are unaware
of the other members' powers,

836
00:29:56,200 --> 00:29:59,000
so you have to be careful
while doing the race.

837
00:29:59,080 --> 00:30:00,280
I'm sure there will be a power
that lets you reflect.

838
00:30:00,280 --> 00:30:03,510
You can use your power according
to how many chances you got earlier.

839
00:30:03,670 --> 00:30:06,650
Also, there are tickets for
the Room of Reinforcement...

840
00:30:06,650 --> 00:30:08,180
hidden all around the venue.

841
00:30:08,250 --> 00:30:09,510
(Room of Reinforcement Ticket)

842
00:30:09,510 --> 00:30:10,890
(Choose 1 member
and bring him or her with you.)

843
00:30:10,890 --> 00:30:12,330
If you find these tickets,

844
00:30:12,330 --> 00:30:14,650
you can choose one person
to go into the room with...

845
00:30:14,800 --> 00:30:16,690
and forcibly summon them.

846
00:30:16,690 --> 00:30:19,300
Then you can use the room
in a group of two.

847
00:30:19,300 --> 00:30:20,530
- In groups of two.
- Both of them must get stronger.

848
00:30:20,530 --> 00:30:23,100
If you succeed in
the hit-or-miss mission in the room,

849
00:30:23,100 --> 00:30:25,400
both members can add more chances
to use their superpower.

850
00:30:25,460 --> 00:30:28,200
Even if you fail, you don't lose
the chances you already have.

851
00:30:28,200 --> 00:30:29,470
- You have to go.
- However,

852
00:30:29,470 --> 00:30:33,050
you can't rip off another member's
name tag while in this room.

853
00:30:33,050 --> 00:30:34,710
- In the Room of Reinforcement?
- Yes.

854
00:30:35,050 --> 00:30:37,240
Please go to the location
of the race.

855
00:30:37,240 --> 00:30:39,480
- Let's go!
- I'm getting excited.

856
00:30:39,480 --> 00:30:40,480
I should try to win.

857
00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:42,320
- It's been 10 years.
- Let's try to win.

858
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:43,480
Oh, my gosh.

859
00:30:43,480 --> 00:30:45,180
(The Number of Times
They Can Use Their Superpower)

860
00:30:45,180 --> 00:30:46,420
I really want to win this one.

861
00:30:46,420 --> 00:30:49,400
It's been 10 years since we had
a superpower race.

862
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:52,220
If it wasn't for
our 10th anniversary,

863
00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:54,230
I wouldn't want to win as much.

864
00:30:54,230 --> 00:30:55,260
(Bodyguard Summoner)

865
00:30:55,260 --> 00:30:58,610
I'm so curious as to what
the other members' superpowers are.

866
00:31:00,730 --> 00:31:01,840
So Min.

867
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:04,040
You have a cape on.

868
00:31:04,040 --> 00:31:05,080
(So Min. You have a cape on.)

869
00:31:06,310 --> 00:31:09,280
Yoo Jae Suk. Yoo Jae Suk.

870
00:31:09,410 --> 00:31:12,180
Jae Suk. I can really...

871
00:31:12,440 --> 00:31:15,820
bring anyone you'd like
in front of you.

872
00:31:15,860 --> 00:31:17,090
Can you see this?

873
00:31:17,980 --> 00:31:19,950
You can figure out what kind of
superpower I have, right?

874
00:31:19,950 --> 00:31:21,250
(Ttuk-nos, Witch of Push and Pull)

875
00:31:21,250 --> 00:31:22,360
Is that a ring?

876
00:31:22,360 --> 00:31:23,690
(Is that a ring?)

877
00:31:24,460 --> 00:31:27,530
Is he really Thanos?
He must really be Thanos.

878
00:31:28,690 --> 00:31:30,070
You kind of...

879
00:31:30,540 --> 00:31:31,840
Oh, are you Gollum?

880
00:31:31,840 --> 00:31:33,140
(Oh, are you Gollum?)

881
00:31:33,230 --> 00:31:34,400
- What?
- Are you Gollum?

882
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:36,280
You must be Gollum.

883
00:31:36,280 --> 00:31:37,470
My gosh. That brat.

884
00:31:37,470 --> 00:31:38,940
He's Gollum. I should run away.

885
00:31:39,050 --> 00:31:40,050
Back in the day,

886
00:31:40,310 --> 00:31:42,620
if you had one of these, you'd be
the most popular kid in town.

887
00:31:44,510 --> 00:31:47,510
My name is Se Chan. I'm a shooter.

888
00:31:50,360 --> 00:31:52,590
(Serious)

889
00:31:52,860 --> 00:31:53,890
Excuse me.

890
00:31:53,890 --> 00:31:55,400
(He sees an employee passing by.)

891
00:31:55,400 --> 00:31:57,400
I'm doing something cool.

892
00:31:57,400 --> 00:32:00,070
You're looking at me
like I'm childish,

893
00:32:00,070 --> 00:32:01,660
but I'm focusing
on what I have to do today.

894
00:32:01,660 --> 00:32:03,340
- I see.
- You look the coolest.

895
00:32:03,340 --> 00:32:04,640
Thank you.

896
00:32:05,110 --> 00:32:06,960
We'll start the race now.

897
00:32:07,570 --> 00:32:12,550
5, 4, 3, 2, 1.

898
00:32:12,700 --> 00:32:13,900
Race start.

899
00:32:14,510 --> 00:32:16,880
(Superpower School Race,
War of Superpowers: The End Game)

900
00:32:17,170 --> 00:32:18,180
Don't I look cool?

901
00:32:18,790 --> 00:32:20,710
Don't I look like Sailor Moon?

902
00:32:20,710 --> 00:32:22,180
(Don't I look like Sailor Moon?)

903
00:32:22,890 --> 00:32:24,420
(Transformation)

904
00:32:26,250 --> 00:32:28,250
(A side-effect of superpowers:
You get too into character.)

905
00:32:29,630 --> 00:32:30,630
(In the name of the Moon,
I'll punish you!)

906
00:32:30,630 --> 00:32:31,630
Don't I look like Sailor Moon?

907
00:32:31,630 --> 00:32:32,720
(In the name of the Moon,
I'll punish you!)

908
00:32:33,100 --> 00:32:34,960
I'm going to use my superpower
like this.

909
00:32:35,600 --> 00:32:36,960
What are you carrying around
with you?

910
00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:37,960
What?

911
00:32:38,730 --> 00:32:39,960
What are you carrying?

912
00:32:39,960 --> 00:32:41,500
I found something.

913
00:32:41,640 --> 00:32:42,640
(Exclaiming)

914
00:32:42,640 --> 00:32:43,640
Hey.

915
00:32:44,080 --> 00:32:46,440
(Another patient suffering from
the side-effects of superpowers)

916
00:32:46,900 --> 00:32:48,780
- What is that?
- It's a strong weapon.

917
00:32:48,780 --> 00:32:50,150
I can get rid of you in one shot.

918
00:32:50,150 --> 00:32:53,650
What is that? You really
have some type of gadget.

919
00:32:53,940 --> 00:32:55,180
It must be a bomb.

920
00:32:55,180 --> 00:32:56,180
(It must be a bomb.)

921
00:32:56,180 --> 00:32:57,290
- A bomb?
- It's a bomb.

922
00:32:57,290 --> 00:32:58,560
Does he have a bomb on his wrist?

923
00:32:58,560 --> 00:33:00,720
- Do you know what this is?
- It's a water gun.

924
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:01,830
(Now he sees what it is.)

925
00:33:01,830 --> 00:33:02,900
A water gun?

926
00:33:03,330 --> 00:33:04,530
It's a water gun.

927
00:33:04,530 --> 00:33:06,630
(They are being cautious as they
don't know about the superpowers.)

928
00:33:06,630 --> 00:33:07,870
Once you're shot,

929
00:33:08,460 --> 00:33:10,640
- Gosh, what's that?
- you'll be eliminated immediately.

930
00:33:10,840 --> 00:33:12,570
- What's your superpower?
- What's that, Suk Jin?

931
00:33:12,570 --> 00:33:13,760
- Is it some kind of device?
- Are you a peddler?

932
00:33:13,760 --> 00:33:14,840
- What?
- Are you a peddler?

933
00:33:14,840 --> 00:33:16,380
Hey, once I open this,

934
00:33:16,930 --> 00:33:18,050
you guys will die.

935
00:33:18,170 --> 00:33:20,170
- I think he's a vendor.
- No.

936
00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:21,510
- You're a vendor, right?
- No.

937
00:33:21,510 --> 00:33:22,550
He's a peddler.

938
00:33:22,550 --> 00:33:23,820
- I'm not here to sell stuff.
- I think...

939
00:33:23,820 --> 00:33:25,090
- he will sell this later.
- Are you a peddler?

940
00:33:25,350 --> 00:33:27,680
(Sang Yeob shows up
with something in his hand.)

941
00:33:27,910 --> 00:33:29,390
- Hey.
- Wait. He has a mirror.

942
00:33:29,480 --> 00:33:30,590
He has a mirror.

943
00:33:30,620 --> 00:33:32,060
(Sang Yeob is caught with the mirror
for his superpower.)

944
00:33:32,060 --> 00:33:33,650
- I just used it to check my face.
- What is it for?

945
00:33:33,750 --> 00:33:35,300
Don't be ridiculous.

946
00:33:35,560 --> 00:33:37,060
Once I open this...

947
00:33:37,190 --> 00:33:38,530
and throw it down, you all will die.

948
00:33:38,570 --> 00:33:39,720
Are you Spider-Man?

949
00:33:41,140 --> 00:33:42,300
Do you want me to open this?

950
00:33:43,400 --> 00:33:44,430
Do you want me to open this?

951
00:33:44,570 --> 00:33:46,040
I'm going to open this.

952
00:33:46,140 --> 00:33:47,260
Do you want me to do it?

953
00:33:47,260 --> 00:33:48,730
I guess he has
packed lunch in there.

954
00:33:49,040 --> 00:33:50,340
- Should I open it?
- Go ahead.

955
00:33:50,340 --> 00:33:51,650
- I will...
- I'm going to open it.

956
00:33:51,650 --> 00:33:52,850
I'll buy two.

957
00:33:52,850 --> 00:33:54,710
- I want 2.
- Do you want 2?

958
00:33:55,080 --> 00:33:57,010
- It's not something you can buy.
- I'll buy two books.

959
00:33:57,010 --> 00:33:59,180
Once you touch it, you will die.

960
00:33:59,180 --> 00:34:01,180
- I'm sure Suk Jin is a vendor.
- He's a vendor.

961
00:34:01,180 --> 00:34:03,890
- Your superpower is selling.
- Why is my weapon so heavy?

962
00:34:03,890 --> 00:34:06,480
His superpower requires
a lot of work.

963
00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:07,920
I think I'm the coolest one here.

964
00:34:07,920 --> 00:34:09,030
(Satisfied)

965
00:34:09,360 --> 00:34:11,030
I should find the ticket
to the Room of Reinforcement.

966
00:34:11,030 --> 00:34:12,070
(I should find the ticket
to the Room of Reinforcement.)

967
00:34:12,070 --> 00:34:13,370
- Suk Jin. What's that?
- Hey.

968
00:34:13,370 --> 00:34:14,490
- Feeling!
- Intuition!

969
00:34:14,490 --> 00:34:15,590
- Cross!
- Cross!

970
00:34:16,430 --> 00:34:17,470
What's that?

971
00:34:17,470 --> 00:34:19,630
Honestly, my superpower
isn't that cool.

972
00:34:19,630 --> 00:34:21,380
But it looks perfect on you.

973
00:34:21,380 --> 00:34:22,880
Wish me good luck.

974
00:34:22,880 --> 00:34:24,180
- It's not so cool.
- You know it, right?

975
00:34:24,180 --> 00:34:26,380
- It's not cool, but my power...
- There's Jong Kook.

976
00:34:26,680 --> 00:34:29,050
- He's wearing gloves.
- Why is he wearing gloves?

977
00:34:29,150 --> 00:34:31,150
(He looks charismatic
with the gloves on.)

978
00:34:31,610 --> 00:34:32,650
Are you upset?

979
00:34:33,240 --> 00:34:34,820
What are the gloves for?

980
00:34:35,090 --> 00:34:36,490
My superpower is...

981
00:34:36,490 --> 00:34:37,760
beating people to death.

982
00:34:38,260 --> 00:34:39,760
- It's not a superpower.
- Hey.

983
00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:41,900
You can do that
even without a superpower.

984
00:34:42,550 --> 00:34:43,820
My superpower is
beating people to death.

985
00:34:44,630 --> 00:34:46,860
- He has a package.
- Drop the beat!

986
00:34:46,860 --> 00:34:48,030
(Drop the beat!)

987
00:34:50,300 --> 00:34:52,030
Drop the beat!

988
00:34:52,930 --> 00:34:54,430
- What was that?
- Did you use your superpower?

989
00:34:54,430 --> 00:34:55,470
(Did she use her superpower?)

990
00:34:56,280 --> 00:34:57,740
(She suddenly starts to dance.)

991
00:34:57,740 --> 00:34:59,550
- What is she doing?
- It has something to do with dance.

992
00:34:59,550 --> 00:35:00,650
(Feeling nervous)

993
00:35:02,050 --> 00:35:05,820
- What? Did she use her power?
- I guess there's something.

994
00:35:05,820 --> 00:35:08,680
(She uses her superpower
of Charming Dancer.)

995
00:35:09,450 --> 00:35:11,450
"You're Charming Dancer."

996
00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:13,820
"If you shout, 'Drop the beat'..."

997
00:35:13,820 --> 00:35:16,450
"and dance to music for 30 seconds,"

998
00:35:16,450 --> 00:35:18,930
"all the members who watch it..."

999
00:35:18,930 --> 00:35:20,530
"will be blinded."

1000
00:35:20,990 --> 00:35:23,430
"And their vision becomes narrow
for one minute."

1001
00:35:23,430 --> 00:35:27,130
(Charming Dancer)

1002
00:35:27,260 --> 00:35:29,340
(Suk Jin who watched her dance...)

1003
00:35:29,340 --> 00:35:32,650
(has to wear swimming goggles
for 1 minute for narrow vision.)

1004
00:35:32,740 --> 00:35:35,950
(Charming Dancer blinds them all
with her dance moves.)

1005
00:35:35,950 --> 00:35:37,050
(They all get narrow vision.)

1006
00:35:37,050 --> 00:35:38,380
- What?
- I can't see.

1007
00:35:38,380 --> 00:35:40,590
- I can see just a little.
- I can barely see.

1008
00:35:41,010 --> 00:35:42,320
What is this?

1009
00:35:42,990 --> 00:35:44,160
One minute?

1010
00:35:44,160 --> 00:35:45,220
(Right at that moment)

1011
00:35:45,220 --> 00:35:47,160
(Han Na is attacking?)

1012
00:35:47,380 --> 00:35:48,450
What was that?

1013
00:35:48,450 --> 00:35:49,450
(She rips off Suk Jin's
name tag immediately.)

1014
00:35:49,630 --> 00:35:51,050
- Who was that?
- What just happened? Suk Jin.

1015
00:35:51,050 --> 00:35:52,760
- What?
- The race starter is back.

1016
00:35:52,760 --> 00:35:54,030
- Hey!
- Already?

1017
00:35:54,030 --> 00:35:55,660
- This is...
- Who took off my name tag?

1018
00:35:55,760 --> 00:35:56,760
Suk Jin, you're out.

1019
00:35:56,760 --> 00:35:57,840
I'm out?

1020
00:35:57,840 --> 00:35:59,340
Hey, we've just started.

1021
00:36:00,570 --> 00:36:02,470
- Is it over?
- You're so mean.

1022
00:36:02,470 --> 00:36:04,200
- Hey! Han Na!
- Seriously?

1023
00:36:04,200 --> 00:36:05,280
Is it really over for him?

1024
00:36:05,650 --> 00:36:08,050
What was that?
It's been less than five minutes.

1025
00:36:08,050 --> 00:36:10,410
Suk Jin, put down your bundle
and get some rest.

1026
00:36:10,410 --> 00:36:11,910
But this is for our
10th year anniversary.

1027
00:36:11,910 --> 00:36:13,240
My goodness.

1028
00:36:13,450 --> 00:36:15,010
Kang Han Na.

1029
00:36:15,090 --> 00:36:16,550
Han Na, I'll get back
at you for this.

1030
00:36:17,680 --> 00:36:18,930
This is nice.

1031
00:36:18,930 --> 00:36:20,590
(Charming Dancer feels proud
after eliminating him.)

1032
00:36:20,590 --> 00:36:21,660
What's your superpower?

1033
00:36:21,660 --> 00:36:24,130
(The four superheroes are
in front of the cafeteria.)

1034
00:36:24,130 --> 00:36:25,660
- You're Thanos.
- Right. He's Thanos.

1035
00:36:25,660 --> 00:36:27,070
- He can eliminate us immediately.
- You will snap your fingers.

1036
00:36:27,070 --> 00:36:28,340
With a snap.

1037
00:36:28,340 --> 00:36:31,300
It's a random choice. Once he snaps
his fingers, one of us will die.

1038
00:36:31,360 --> 00:36:32,800
Go ahead and try it.
Let's see what happens.

1039
00:36:33,530 --> 00:36:35,630
No. I can't use it now.

1040
00:36:35,630 --> 00:36:37,530
My superpower is just too strong.

1041
00:36:37,950 --> 00:36:39,740
- You might get hurt.
- Before I rip off your name tag.

1042
00:36:41,340 --> 00:36:43,340
Come here, guys. Are you ready?

1043
00:36:43,720 --> 00:36:45,150
- Are you ready?
- We're ready.

1044
00:36:45,150 --> 00:36:46,340
Shall we begin?

1045
00:36:51,950 --> 00:36:53,660
(What?)

1046
00:36:53,660 --> 00:36:54,700
(Shrieking)

1047
00:36:54,700 --> 00:36:55,700
You're...

1048
00:36:56,590 --> 00:36:59,200
- Hey, you're...
- We are three superheroes.

1049
00:36:59,200 --> 00:37:01,360
Do you really want to do that
to fight against me?

1050
00:37:01,360 --> 00:37:03,360
- We are three superheroes.
- Are you ready?

1051
00:37:04,160 --> 00:37:05,200
Let's go!

1052
00:37:06,630 --> 00:37:07,700
(Thump)

1053
00:37:08,510 --> 00:37:09,740
- It must hurt.
- Are you all right?

1054
00:37:10,380 --> 00:37:11,700
(Thump)

1055
00:37:12,450 --> 00:37:13,800
- It must hurt.
- Are you all right?

1056
00:37:13,800 --> 00:37:15,410
- Cut.
- Are you okay?

1057
00:37:15,550 --> 00:37:16,610
Okay.

1058
00:37:16,610 --> 00:37:19,410
If you're being like this,
I'll use my strong superpower.

1059
00:37:20,010 --> 00:37:21,220
- Okay?
- Jae Suk.

1060
00:37:21,220 --> 00:37:22,320
Se Chan.

1061
00:37:23,050 --> 00:37:25,180
- You're going to take his side?
- Se Chan!

1062
00:37:26,280 --> 00:37:27,530
Se Chan!

1063
00:37:27,530 --> 00:37:30,530
(Combined)

1064
00:37:33,360 --> 00:37:34,360
Let's go, So Min.

1065
00:37:34,360 --> 00:37:35,660
(They don't want to lose.)

1066
00:37:38,410 --> 00:37:39,510
What is she doing?

1067
00:37:39,510 --> 00:37:40,610
(Embarrassed)

1068
00:37:40,610 --> 00:37:42,010
- We are very strong.
- Okay.

1069
00:37:42,180 --> 00:37:44,340
- We can do this. Haha, we can win.
- You should give up.

1070
00:37:44,340 --> 00:37:46,200
Se Chan betrayed us. All right.

1071
00:37:46,970 --> 00:37:48,180
I'll remember that.

1072
00:37:48,180 --> 00:37:49,910
(Bodyguard Summoner Ji Hyo
shows up right at the moment.)

1073
00:37:49,910 --> 00:37:52,280
- We should form an alliance.
- Seriously.

1074
00:37:52,610 --> 00:37:54,680
I bet you have
an amazing superpower.

1075
00:37:54,720 --> 00:37:55,820
(Right at the moment...)

1076
00:37:55,820 --> 00:37:57,090
- What?
- What is that?

1077
00:37:57,090 --> 00:37:58,160
What's going on?

1078
00:37:58,160 --> 00:38:00,050
(Something shows up
all of a sudden.)

1079
00:38:00,490 --> 00:38:01,860
- What's going on?
- What is it?

1080
00:38:01,860 --> 00:38:03,530
(Suk Jin has become a king?)

1081
00:38:04,450 --> 00:38:07,220
(His superpower is...)

1082
00:38:09,030 --> 00:38:12,410
(Past Life Summoner)

1083
00:38:12,410 --> 00:38:15,970
(If you shout "I still have a life"
lifting up a bundle,)

1084
00:38:15,970 --> 00:38:19,650
(you will be born again
in the form of your past life.)

1085
00:38:20,450 --> 00:38:23,910
(Suk Jin can be born again
in the form of his past life.)

1086
00:38:24,740 --> 00:38:28,010
(Suk Jin got eliminated
by Charming Dancer,)

1087
00:38:28,010 --> 00:38:31,090
(but he had a faint smile on
for a reason.)

1088
00:38:32,220 --> 00:38:33,450
I still...

1089
00:38:33,450 --> 00:38:36,490
have a life.

1090
00:38:41,200 --> 00:38:42,400
I'm born again.

1091
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:44,430
(He's reincarnated
as a king of the Joseon Dynasty.)

1092
00:38:44,470 --> 00:38:46,240
- What's going on?
- You brats.

1093
00:38:46,240 --> 00:38:47,340
What's all this?

1094
00:38:47,360 --> 00:38:48,910
- What is he doing?
- What's going on?

1095
00:38:48,910 --> 00:38:51,130
Did you not watch the movie
that features Jang Dong Gun?

1096
00:38:51,380 --> 00:38:52,610
Jae Suk.

1097
00:38:52,610 --> 00:38:54,200
Poison Needle Sorcerer
used his superpower against you.

1098
00:38:54,200 --> 00:38:55,820
You will be paralyzed in 15 seconds.

1099
00:38:56,840 --> 00:38:59,590
(Did Jae Suk get
a poisonous sting?)

1100
00:38:59,590 --> 00:39:02,180
- Who used it against me?
- 15, 14, 13...

1101
00:39:02,180 --> 00:39:03,820
Hurry. Let's follow Jae Suk!

1102
00:39:03,880 --> 00:39:06,260
- Ji Hyo, hurry. Ji Hyo, come here.
- I'm coming.

1103
00:39:06,260 --> 00:39:08,530
- 11.
- Ji Hyo, hurry and run.

1104
00:39:08,660 --> 00:39:10,820
5, 4,

1105
00:39:10,820 --> 00:39:12,260
- 3, 2...
- I will use it.

1106
00:39:12,260 --> 00:39:15,970
<i>Completely turn me over</i>

1107
00:39:15,970 --> 00:39:18,130
(Completely turn me over!)

1108
00:39:18,910 --> 00:39:20,200
(Jae Suk used his superpower
before he got paralyzed.)

1109
00:39:20,200 --> 00:39:21,840
All right. Pause for a moment.

1110
00:39:21,910 --> 00:39:23,240
Jae Suk used his superpower.

1111
00:39:23,240 --> 00:39:24,340
What is it?

1112
00:39:24,340 --> 00:39:25,510
(Jae Suk's superpower is...)

1113
00:39:26,150 --> 00:39:27,740
(Ttuk-nos)

1114
00:39:27,740 --> 00:39:30,820
(Snap your fingers and sing,
"Completely turn me over,")

1115
00:39:30,820 --> 00:39:33,490
(to make 3 members
freeze for a minute.)

1116
00:39:34,320 --> 00:39:35,490
Completely turn you over?

1117
00:39:35,490 --> 00:39:36,720
(He picks 3 members to freeze.)

1118
00:39:37,180 --> 00:39:38,990
(Please don't pick me.)

1119
00:39:39,360 --> 00:39:41,360
Good. It's done.

1120
00:39:41,950 --> 00:39:45,820
(Jae Suk uses his superpower
to freeze 3 members for a minute.)

1121
00:39:46,820 --> 00:39:48,970
- What? I can't move?
- What?

1122
00:39:49,070 --> 00:39:50,260
- How long does he stay paralyzed?
- 30 seconds.

1123
00:39:50,740 --> 00:39:52,240
There's Ji Hyo.

1124
00:39:52,970 --> 00:39:54,570
I can't do anything?

1125
00:39:54,570 --> 00:39:56,380
(While all three
of them are frozen...)

1126
00:39:56,840 --> 00:39:58,280
What are you doing? What is it?

1127
00:39:58,880 --> 00:40:00,470
- What are you doing now?
- Stay still. Attention.

1128
00:40:00,470 --> 00:40:02,010
- What do you want?
- What?

1129
00:40:02,010 --> 00:40:03,970
- What's going on?
- What is he doing?

1130
00:40:04,320 --> 00:40:06,220
You should shoot
a period drama somewhere else.

1131
00:40:06,280 --> 00:40:08,990
We're shooting Running Man here.
What are you doing?

1132
00:40:08,990 --> 00:40:10,610
- Wait.
- Just stay still.

1133
00:40:10,610 --> 00:40:12,660
- Why would he say "attention"?
- Stay put.

1134
00:40:12,660 --> 00:40:13,720
Isn't it over yet?

1135
00:40:13,720 --> 00:40:15,320
- Stay still!
- Jae Suk is relieved now.

1136
00:40:15,990 --> 00:40:18,090
Hang on. I should go to Ji Hyo.

1137
00:40:18,090 --> 00:40:20,820
<i>And I will</i>

1138
00:40:20,860 --> 00:40:21,930
You can't use your superpower
when you're frozen.

1139
00:40:21,930 --> 00:40:23,860
Gosh, no!

1140
00:40:23,990 --> 00:40:25,260
- Come here!
- No.

1141
00:40:25,260 --> 00:40:26,430
Stop singing.

1142
00:40:27,300 --> 00:40:28,410
- Stop it.
- No!

1143
00:40:28,410 --> 00:40:30,010
- No!
- I have to get rid of you.

1144
00:40:30,010 --> 00:40:31,610
No! You can't do this to me.

1145
00:40:31,610 --> 00:40:33,470
- Ji Hyo!
- No!

1146
00:40:33,610 --> 00:40:35,380
- Ji Hyo!
- No!

1147
00:40:36,220 --> 00:40:37,570
I said no!

1148
00:40:37,820 --> 00:40:40,590
- Ji Hyo.
- <i>And I will</i>

1149
00:40:40,950 --> 00:40:42,910
- What's happening, Ji Hyo?
- <i>And I will</i>

1150
00:40:43,550 --> 00:40:44,820
And I will!

1151
00:40:44,880 --> 00:40:46,280
Hey! I called you!

1152
00:40:46,280 --> 00:40:47,450
(Right at the moment!)

1153
00:40:47,450 --> 00:40:48,820
- And I will!
- What is this now?

1154
00:40:49,030 --> 00:40:50,430
Hey! I called you!

1155
00:40:50,490 --> 00:40:54,300
(Her bodyguard shows up
as soon as the pause is over.)

1156
00:40:55,740 --> 00:40:59,970
(Your superpower lets you
summon a bodyguard.)

1157
00:40:59,970 --> 00:41:04,180
(Summon a bodyguard by raising
your arms overhead and singing.)

1158
00:41:06,050 --> 00:41:07,610
(Her bodyguard seems
somewhat weak and timid though.)

1159
00:41:07,610 --> 00:41:09,010
Is he her bodyguard?

1160
00:41:09,110 --> 00:41:10,340
What's going on?

1161
00:41:10,470 --> 00:41:12,150
- What's that song about?
- And I will!

1162
00:41:12,280 --> 00:41:14,550
- Hey, my superpower is...
- What's going on?

1163
00:41:14,550 --> 00:41:15,760
- What was that?
- What was that?

1164
00:41:16,260 --> 00:41:17,490
- What was all that?
- She got a bodyguard.

1165
00:41:17,490 --> 00:41:19,680
(While her bodyguard
protects her...)

1166
00:41:19,990 --> 00:41:21,090
- Hey!
- I mean...

1167
00:41:21,090 --> 00:41:22,590
What was the song about?

1168
00:41:22,700 --> 00:41:25,630
(Bodyguard Summoner Ji Hyo
runs away as fast as she can.)

1169
00:41:25,630 --> 00:41:26,930
Why did you not come?

1170
00:41:26,930 --> 00:41:28,340
I almost got eliminated!

1171
00:41:29,130 --> 00:41:32,340
(Despite his looks,
he managed to protect Ji Hyo.)

1172
00:41:32,340 --> 00:41:33,740
He protects Ji Hyo.

1173
00:41:34,660 --> 00:41:36,700
So our superpowers are
like a comedy.

1174
00:41:37,680 --> 00:41:39,610
They are not afraid of me at all.

1175
00:41:40,010 --> 00:41:42,470
(He charges towards Suk Jin.)

1176
00:41:42,470 --> 00:41:43,570
- Come here.
- Your Majesty.

1177
00:41:43,570 --> 00:41:44,840
- What?
- Please leave.

1178
00:41:44,840 --> 00:41:46,820
Where would I go? I just got back.

1179
00:41:49,320 --> 00:41:51,380
What? What is it?

1180
00:41:51,630 --> 00:41:53,550
I guess Suk Jin is nothing.

1181
00:41:54,590 --> 00:41:55,820
What is Suk Jin doing?

1182
00:41:55,950 --> 00:41:57,030
What are you doing?

1183
00:41:57,030 --> 00:41:58,760
What is it? Is it a diaper?

1184
00:41:59,220 --> 00:42:00,320
Come here.

1185
00:42:00,720 --> 00:42:02,240
- Is it your diaper?
- Hey.

1186
00:42:02,430 --> 00:42:04,070
Why is he running around like that?

1187
00:42:04,070 --> 00:42:06,010
Let's get rid of the king.

1188
00:42:06,010 --> 00:42:07,260
- Let's do that.
- Let him put on his name tag.

1189
00:42:07,260 --> 00:42:09,630
Come here. I'll get rid of you.

1190
00:42:09,630 --> 00:42:11,570
Look at you. How dare you...

1191
00:42:12,200 --> 00:42:13,610
(Screaming)

1192
00:42:13,610 --> 00:42:14,700
He's got nothing.

1193
00:42:14,700 --> 00:42:16,450
(They don't fall for his trick.)

1194
00:42:17,010 --> 00:42:18,610
(He gets caught immediately.)

1195
00:42:19,340 --> 00:42:20,450
(The king has lost his dignity.)

1196
00:42:20,450 --> 00:42:22,360
- He's got nothing.
- I shot him.

1197
00:42:22,550 --> 00:42:24,780
(Poison Needle Sorcerer
used his superpower.)

1198
00:42:25,050 --> 00:42:26,630
- Am I paralyzed?
- 14.

1199
00:42:26,880 --> 00:42:28,400
- You should run away.
- 13.

1200
00:42:28,400 --> 00:42:29,860
You'll be paralyzed in 14 seconds.

1201
00:42:29,860 --> 00:42:31,760
- Me? Okay.
- 10, 9...

1202
00:42:32,860 --> 00:42:34,630
(His diaper is slipping down.)

1203
00:42:35,630 --> 00:42:36,860
This is slipping down.

1204
00:42:36,860 --> 00:42:39,200
(He can't run so far.)

1205
00:42:39,200 --> 00:42:41,200
You're paralyzed now.

1206
00:42:41,200 --> 00:42:42,970
(He's paralyzed for 30 seconds.)

1207
00:42:43,570 --> 00:42:45,450
- You should lie down.
- Lie down.

1208
00:42:45,880 --> 00:42:47,910
- What is he, by the way?
- You're paralyzed.

1209
00:42:47,910 --> 00:42:48,970
(King Suk Jin got poisoned
and fell ill.)

1210
00:42:49,970 --> 00:42:51,470
How dare you!

1211
00:42:51,470 --> 00:42:53,880
- Forgive me, Your Majesty.
- I told you to stop.

1212
00:42:53,880 --> 00:42:55,090
Suk Jin is out.

1213
00:42:55,090 --> 00:42:57,660
- Forgive me, Your Majesty.
- I told you to stop.

1214
00:42:57,660 --> 00:42:58,780
Suk Jin is out.

1215
00:42:58,880 --> 00:43:00,530
- What is up with Suk Jin?
- Seriously.

1216
00:43:00,530 --> 00:43:02,820
- Why is he so weak?
- I couldn't use my superpower.

1217
00:43:03,590 --> 00:43:05,400
Why didn't you use your superpower?

1218
00:43:05,400 --> 00:43:06,430
(Frustrated)

1219
00:43:06,800 --> 00:43:08,030
Why didn't you use...

1220
00:43:08,030 --> 00:43:09,970
Watch the episode when it airs.
You will see why I didn't use it.

1221
00:43:10,800 --> 00:43:12,530
Why didn't you use your superpower?

1222
00:43:12,530 --> 00:43:14,240
You will see why I didn't use it.

1223
00:43:14,240 --> 00:43:16,410
Who used the poison needle on me?

1224
00:43:16,970 --> 00:43:18,010
I did.

1225
00:43:18,010 --> 00:43:19,450
(Honest)

1226
00:43:19,450 --> 00:43:21,820
(You did?)

1227
00:43:23,010 --> 00:43:24,070
What is up with him?

1228
00:43:24,070 --> 00:43:25,510
(While his attention was
on King Suk Jin,)

1229
00:43:25,510 --> 00:43:27,590
(he secretly shot
the poison needle.)

1230
00:43:27,590 --> 00:43:28,660
What?

1231
00:43:29,880 --> 00:43:31,180
I am the Poison Needle Sorcerer.

1232
00:43:31,180 --> 00:43:32,780
(He was attacked by someone
he thought was on his side.)

1233
00:43:32,780 --> 00:43:34,050
You are less than human.

1234
00:43:34,220 --> 00:43:36,400
Your back was
right in front of my face,

1235
00:43:36,400 --> 00:43:38,630
so I tested my superpower,
and it worked so well.

1236
00:43:38,970 --> 00:43:41,800
I had to figure out
what your superpower is.

1237
00:43:41,800 --> 00:43:43,400
Now I know.
You know my superpower too.

1238
00:43:43,400 --> 00:43:45,030
- We are even.
- Okay.

1239
00:43:45,470 --> 00:43:47,030
Do you know
that they joined forces?

1240
00:43:47,130 --> 00:43:48,300
- Who did?
- They joined forces.

1241
00:43:48,300 --> 00:43:49,880
- Jae Suk and Se Chan.
- Se Chan betrayed us.

1242
00:43:49,970 --> 00:43:51,510
Why don't the three of us
join forces?

1243
00:43:51,780 --> 00:43:53,150
- I need to be in a team.
- What's your superpower?

1244
00:43:53,280 --> 00:43:55,150
It's meaningless for me
to be by myself.

1245
00:43:55,150 --> 00:43:56,380
- Me too.
- I need to be in a team.

1246
00:43:56,380 --> 00:43:59,380
Even if you get attacked,
I can turn the tables.

1247
00:43:59,610 --> 00:44:01,410
I can help you rip off
someone's name tag.

1248
00:44:01,410 --> 00:44:02,610
- You just need to rip it off.
- That's right.

1249
00:44:02,610 --> 00:44:04,360
- Thus, we should join forces.
- Really?

1250
00:44:04,550 --> 00:44:05,880
- Will you join the team?
- Let's join forces.

1251
00:44:05,990 --> 00:44:07,280
- Yes, I will join the team.
- Let's do that.

1252
00:44:07,380 --> 00:44:08,530
Hold on.

1253
00:44:08,530 --> 00:44:10,760
How did I think to do something
with these two?

1254
00:44:10,820 --> 00:44:13,160
The two of you are
just as untrustworthy.

1255
00:44:13,470 --> 00:44:14,470
Out of all people, it's you two.

1256
00:44:14,470 --> 00:44:15,900
I really like this idea.

1257
00:44:15,900 --> 00:44:16,930
- I like it too.
- I like it too.

1258
00:44:16,930 --> 00:44:17,990
You can use it many times, right?

1259
00:44:17,990 --> 00:44:19,030
Three times.

1260
00:44:19,030 --> 00:44:20,130
- Let's do this.
- Let's go.

1261
00:44:20,300 --> 00:44:22,240
- 1, 2, 3. Let's go.
- Let's go.

1262
00:44:22,240 --> 00:44:23,300
- Keep your promise.
- I'm going to use my superpower...

1263
00:44:23,300 --> 00:44:24,410
as soon as someone appears.

1264
00:44:24,530 --> 00:44:26,950
Let's go. So Min, don't betray us.

1265
00:44:26,950 --> 00:44:27,970
I won't.

1266
00:44:28,840 --> 00:44:30,550
If you rip off my name tag...
For goodness' sake!

1267
00:44:30,550 --> 00:44:31,680
I didn't do anything.

1268
00:44:31,680 --> 00:44:33,220
- It was a cameraman.
- It was a cameraman.

1269
00:44:33,680 --> 00:44:34,780
- It was a cameraman.
- A cameraman.

1270
00:44:34,780 --> 00:44:36,010
I will use my superpower!

1271
00:44:36,510 --> 00:44:37,610
I will use it!

1272
00:44:38,050 --> 00:44:39,130
Come on.

1273
00:44:40,130 --> 00:44:41,130
(Startled)

1274
00:44:41,130 --> 00:44:42,300
Come on.

1275
00:44:42,530 --> 00:44:43,550
I didn't do anything.

1276
00:44:43,550 --> 00:44:45,220
(The smallest movement
puts them on edge.)

1277
00:44:45,220 --> 00:44:46,570
I could use my superpower
right away.

1278
00:44:47,490 --> 00:44:49,660
Do you want to see me turn my wrist?

1279
00:44:50,740 --> 00:44:51,840
Let's keep going.

1280
00:44:51,970 --> 00:44:53,300
(Clearing her throat)

1281
00:44:54,470 --> 00:44:57,300
(They are nervous as they don't know
each other's superpower.)

1282
00:44:57,300 --> 00:44:58,610
(Clearing her throat)

1283
00:45:01,410 --> 00:45:04,220
Come, come, pull!

1284
00:45:05,510 --> 00:45:07,740
(So Min uses her superpower.)

1285
00:45:10,360 --> 00:45:12,280
"You are the Witch
of Push and Pull."

1286
00:45:12,490 --> 00:45:14,220
(Say "Push" to push
the others away from you.)

1287
00:45:14,220 --> 00:45:16,660
Go, go, push!

1288
00:45:16,660 --> 00:45:18,930
(Say "Pull" to pull
the others toward you.)

1289
00:45:19,260 --> 00:45:21,320
Come, come, pull!

1290
00:45:21,320 --> 00:45:22,340
(The Witch of Push and Pull
uses her superpower.)

1291
00:45:22,340 --> 00:45:23,340
(Haha, An actor
who specializes in superpowers)

1292
00:45:23,340 --> 00:45:24,340
What is going on?

1293
00:45:24,590 --> 00:45:25,930
What is going on?

1294
00:45:25,930 --> 00:45:28,930
(His realistic performance
calls for computer graphics.)

1295
00:45:28,930 --> 00:45:30,680
(What is going on?)

1296
00:45:31,300 --> 00:45:32,510
(Come on and remove his name tag!)

1297
00:45:32,510 --> 00:45:34,380
Hey, don't do that!

1298
00:45:34,470 --> 00:45:36,970
(While Kwang Soo is in a daze)

1299
00:45:37,110 --> 00:45:38,240
It's over.

1300
00:45:38,240 --> 00:45:41,340
You should have ripped it off!

1301
00:45:41,340 --> 00:45:42,720
- What?
- Why didn't you rip it off?

1302
00:45:42,720 --> 00:45:45,590
You should've told me the rules!
You should've told me how!

1303
00:45:46,430 --> 00:45:48,030
(The alliance falls apart
in 5 minutes.)

1304
00:45:48,030 --> 00:45:49,300
I can't believe it.

1305
00:45:49,930 --> 00:45:51,320
So the effect ends
when she can't go on.

1306
00:45:51,320 --> 00:45:53,070
(Kwang Soo gets the plan.)

1307
00:45:54,320 --> 00:45:55,760
What are you guys doing?

1308
00:45:56,260 --> 00:45:57,430
What are you guys doing?

1309
00:45:57,430 --> 00:45:58,800
- You ruined our alliance.
- What are you guys doing?

1310
00:45:58,800 --> 00:46:00,760
What are you guys doing? Stop it!

1311
00:46:00,760 --> 00:46:04,130
No! This is my first time
to have a superpower.

1312
00:46:04,130 --> 00:46:06,610
Go, go, push!

1313
00:46:07,180 --> 00:46:08,720
Is it a different skill?

1314
00:46:08,720 --> 00:46:09,740
My goodness.

1315
00:46:10,470 --> 00:46:12,950
(The actor who specializes
in superpowers puts on a show.)

1316
00:46:13,220 --> 00:46:14,950
(The Witch of Push and Pull
creates a hassle for everyone.)

1317
00:46:14,950 --> 00:46:16,160
You ruined our alliance.

1318
00:46:17,550 --> 00:46:20,630
(Meanwhile,
So Min runs away quickly.)

1319
00:46:21,930 --> 00:46:23,530
(She manages to escape.)

1320
00:46:23,530 --> 00:46:25,090
Gosh, So Min.

1321
00:46:25,800 --> 00:46:27,260
- Kwang Soo, did you see that?
- Haha.

1322
00:46:27,900 --> 00:46:28,990
Let's stay together
until the very end.

1323
00:46:28,990 --> 00:46:30,740
I will keep my promise today.

1324
00:46:30,900 --> 00:46:32,130
Let's go.

1325
00:46:32,130 --> 00:46:34,410
I can't believe So Min.
How could she betray me?

1326
00:46:35,130 --> 00:46:36,570
You have only one chance left.

1327
00:46:36,570 --> 00:46:38,430
I need to find
the Room of Reinforcement.

1328
00:46:39,510 --> 00:46:41,110
(Sang Yeob was wandering
by himself.)

1329
00:46:41,110 --> 00:46:42,780
Jae Suk.

1330
00:46:42,780 --> 00:46:44,110
- It's Sang Yeob.
- What's his superpower?

1331
00:46:44,110 --> 00:46:45,880
He has a mirror.

1332
00:46:46,280 --> 00:46:48,340
It's just my mirror.

1333
00:46:48,340 --> 00:46:49,660
(Sang Yeob seems to be flustered.)

1334
00:46:49,950 --> 00:46:51,680
(Jae Suk notices something!)

1335
00:46:51,990 --> 00:46:53,590
Lee Tae Oh? What is that?

1336
00:46:54,030 --> 00:46:55,700
- What?
- Why does it say Lee Tae Oh?

1337
00:46:55,700 --> 00:46:56,820
What do you mean?

1338
00:46:57,430 --> 00:46:58,820
Why does it say Lee Tae Oh?

1339
00:46:58,820 --> 00:46:59,930
Lee Tae Oh?

1340
00:47:00,860 --> 00:47:02,090
Is there another guest?

1341
00:47:02,090 --> 00:47:04,860
(Why does his name tag say
Lee Tae Oh, not Lee Sang Yeob?)

1342
00:47:05,260 --> 00:47:07,800
You are the Celebrity Copier.

1343
00:47:08,470 --> 00:47:10,510
If you do a voice impression
of a celebrity,

1344
00:47:11,030 --> 00:47:12,950
you can become that celebrity
for three minutes.

1345
00:47:12,950 --> 00:47:14,150
(Sang Yeob can gain a new name tag
through a voice impression.)

1346
00:47:14,150 --> 00:47:15,740
Mirror, mirror,

1347
00:47:15,740 --> 00:47:18,820
who do I look like?

1348
00:47:20,740 --> 00:47:23,280
It's not a sin to fall in love!

1349
00:47:23,720 --> 00:47:25,090
Ji Sun Woo!

1350
00:47:25,090 --> 00:47:26,660
(He used his superpower...)

1351
00:47:26,660 --> 00:47:28,530
(and transformed into Lee Tae Oh.)

1352
00:47:28,900 --> 00:47:33,090
(Even if the name tag gets removed,
Lee Sang Yeob will survive.)

1353
00:47:33,400 --> 00:47:35,360
(Meanwhile, Han Na
was walking around by herself.)

1354
00:47:35,360 --> 00:47:36,570
Sang Yeob!

1355
00:47:37,400 --> 00:47:39,240
(He is on guard.)

1356
00:47:41,010 --> 00:47:42,280
Drop the beat!

1357
00:47:43,780 --> 00:47:44,840
Drop the beat!

1358
00:47:45,200 --> 00:47:46,380
Drop the beat!

1359
00:47:47,650 --> 00:47:50,280
(She blinds him
with a charming dance.)

1360
00:47:52,220 --> 00:47:55,110
(Lee Tae Oh is blinded.)

1361
00:47:55,110 --> 00:47:56,380
What is this?

1362
00:47:56,490 --> 00:47:57,950
Do I walk around like this?

1363
00:47:57,950 --> 00:47:59,990
That's right.

1364
00:48:00,450 --> 00:48:02,130
(Now is my chance!)

1365
00:48:02,760 --> 00:48:04,450
(She attacks right away.)

1366
00:48:04,820 --> 00:48:08,090
(He can't defend himself
due to his narrow field of vision.)

1367
00:48:08,570 --> 00:48:10,900
Lee Tae Oh!

1368
00:48:10,990 --> 00:48:12,760
(Lee Tae Oh is out.)

1369
00:48:12,760 --> 00:48:14,860
Lee Tae Oh is out.
Lee Tae Oh is out.

1370
00:48:14,860 --> 00:48:17,530
- Lee Tae Oh is out.
- Why does it say Lee Tae Oh?

1371
00:48:18,380 --> 00:48:19,950
Why does it say Lee Tae Oh?

1372
00:48:20,700 --> 00:48:22,220
Lee Tae Oh is out.

1373
00:48:22,220 --> 00:48:23,470
- Who?
- Lee Tae Oh is out.

1374
00:48:23,470 --> 00:48:24,610
Who?

1375
00:48:24,610 --> 00:48:26,320
Lee Tae Oh is out.

1376
00:48:26,490 --> 00:48:28,050
- Lee Tae Woo?
- Lee Tae Oh.

1377
00:48:28,050 --> 00:48:29,380
- Lee Tae Oh is out.
- Who is Lee Tae Oh?

1378
00:48:29,380 --> 00:48:30,820
It must be Suk Jin.

1379
00:48:31,590 --> 00:48:32,760
(Everyone is confused about
Lee Tae Oh.)

1380
00:48:32,760 --> 00:48:34,050
Lee Tae Oh from
"A World of Married Couple"?

1381
00:48:35,450 --> 00:48:37,720
(Lee Tae Oh who was eliminated
disappears.)

1382
00:48:37,720 --> 00:48:40,260
Lee Sang Yeob is back.

1383
00:48:42,240 --> 00:48:44,090
(Meanwhile, Ji Hyo used up
her superpower.)

1384
00:48:44,090 --> 00:48:45,130
This is driving me crazy.

1385
00:48:45,130 --> 00:48:46,530
(She is searching for a ticket
for the Room of Reinforcement.)

1386
00:48:46,530 --> 00:48:49,010
I am the only one
without a superpower.

1387
00:48:49,280 --> 00:48:51,130
I am the only one
without a superpower.

1388
00:48:51,970 --> 00:48:54,110
Ji Hyo is over there.

1389
00:48:54,450 --> 00:48:57,240
I will go over to her and use
my superpower.

1390
00:48:59,320 --> 00:49:02,220
You are Captain Gravity.

1391
00:49:02,220 --> 00:49:05,490
(It gives a member of your choice
20kg sandbags.)

1392
00:49:06,660 --> 00:49:08,820
(Ji Hyo doesn't know this.)

1393
00:49:08,820 --> 00:49:11,630
(Captain Gravity is out to get her.)

1394
00:49:12,200 --> 00:49:13,760
Gravity!

1395
00:49:17,760 --> 00:49:20,610
(Haha uses his superpower!)

1396
00:49:25,300 --> 00:49:28,240
(Haha's superpower affects Ji Hyo.)

1397
00:49:31,510 --> 00:49:34,280
(Gravity pulls Ji Hyo down.)

1398
00:49:34,280 --> 00:49:35,950
(Walking slowly)

1399
00:49:36,410 --> 00:49:37,450
Let's go.

1400
00:49:51,080 --> 00:49:54,560
(Ji Hyo couldn't run away
due to the sandbags.)

1401
00:49:54,560 --> 00:49:56,100
(Ripping)

1402
00:49:56,420 --> 00:49:57,860
(He ripped off her name tag!)

1403
00:49:59,690 --> 00:50:01,400
(Ji Hyo gets eliminated...)

1404
00:50:01,400 --> 00:50:02,830
(without a chance
to use her strength.)

1405
00:50:03,330 --> 00:50:06,230
(Laughing)

1406
00:50:06,230 --> 00:50:10,270
(Captain Gravity's superpower
worked well.)

1407
00:50:11,940 --> 00:50:13,880
- Ji Hyo is out.
- Are these sandbags?

1408
00:50:14,480 --> 00:50:15,690
Are these sandbags?

1409
00:50:15,790 --> 00:50:17,380
Who used this power on me?

1410
00:50:17,920 --> 00:50:19,920
Haha is watching from there.
He isn't even surprised.

1411
00:50:19,920 --> 00:50:22,150
- I can't even run.
- Haha used his superpower on her.

1412
00:50:22,150 --> 00:50:24,360
(This is the charm
of the War of Superpowers.)

1413
00:50:24,900 --> 00:50:26,730
Your superpower is incredible.

1414
00:50:26,730 --> 00:50:28,230
(He gives a ceremony.)

1415
00:50:28,230 --> 00:50:30,420
What did you do to me?

1416
00:50:30,420 --> 00:50:32,540
(Ji Hyo became his first victim.)

1417
00:50:32,770 --> 00:50:35,000
(Current Situation)

1418
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:36,900
(Ji Hyo is out.)

1419
00:50:37,670 --> 00:50:38,830
This is funny indeed.

1420
00:50:38,830 --> 00:50:40,580
(Suk Jin is out, but he can use
his superpower 2 more times.)

1421
00:50:41,400 --> 00:50:44,040
(It's his time to summon
his second past life.)

1422
00:50:44,980 --> 00:50:48,940
I still have a life.

1423
00:50:50,520 --> 00:50:53,420
(What's Suk Jin's
second past life?)

1424
00:50:53,420 --> 00:50:55,690
(Ji Suk Jin)

1425
00:50:57,190 --> 00:50:59,520
(He comes back as a commoner
of the Joseon Dynasty.)

1426
00:51:00,230 --> 00:51:03,500
The Korean language is different
from the Chinese language,

1427
00:51:04,020 --> 00:51:06,270
and the written words
and the spoken words don't match.

1428
00:51:06,500 --> 00:51:08,770
The Korean language is different
from the Chinese language,

1429
00:51:09,360 --> 00:51:11,730
and the written words
and the spoken words don't match.

1430
00:51:11,730 --> 00:51:13,440
(Jong Kook bursts out laughing.)

1431
00:51:14,230 --> 00:51:16,940
If I can save the country,
I will sacrifice...

1432
00:51:18,170 --> 00:51:21,040
"If I can save the country..."

1433
00:51:21,040 --> 00:51:22,850
I will sacrifice myself readily.

1434
00:51:23,880 --> 00:51:25,750
Suk Jin.

1435
00:51:26,380 --> 00:51:27,560
Suk Jin,

1436
00:51:27,560 --> 00:51:29,020
- are you filming something?
- What?

1437
00:51:29,880 --> 00:51:31,520
I need to keep saying that.

1438
00:51:32,060 --> 00:51:33,250
Otherwise, I die.

1439
00:51:33,250 --> 00:51:35,270
The Korean language is different
from the Chinese language,

1440
00:51:35,270 --> 00:51:37,420
and the written words
and the spoken words don't match.

1441
00:51:37,420 --> 00:51:38,940
- In any case,
- Suk Jin.

1442
00:51:38,940 --> 00:51:40,690
be careful.

1443
00:51:40,860 --> 00:51:43,330
Don't make me recite
"Hunminjeongeum".

1444
00:51:43,830 --> 00:51:45,540
The Korean language is different
from the Chinese language...

1445
00:51:46,170 --> 00:51:47,940
- Do you need to memorize that?
- I can't recite what comes next.

1446
00:51:47,940 --> 00:51:50,540
I can't make a mistake.

1447
00:51:51,670 --> 00:51:53,040
For goodness' sake.

1448
00:51:53,520 --> 00:51:54,750
Suk Jin, you are so funny here.

1449
00:51:54,750 --> 00:51:56,750
Why aren't you funny
on your YouTube channel?

1450
00:51:58,020 --> 00:51:59,690
I want to act normal on my channel.

1451
00:51:59,690 --> 00:52:00,790
I want to act cool.

1452
00:52:00,790 --> 00:52:01,860
Don't do that.

1453
00:52:01,860 --> 00:52:04,960
- I want to act cool.
- It's better when you look foolish.

1454
00:52:04,960 --> 00:52:07,560
Where is everyone? Come on out!

1455
00:52:08,060 --> 00:52:09,520
You jerks!

1456
00:52:10,170 --> 00:52:12,940
- Suk Jin, you are so funny.
- You...

1457
00:52:13,100 --> 00:52:14,730
You are so funny.

1458
00:52:15,040 --> 00:52:17,670
Once I recite "Hunminjeongeum",
you are done for.

1459
00:52:17,670 --> 00:52:18,670
- All right.
- You jerks!

1460
00:52:18,670 --> 00:52:20,810
- Okay.
- The Korean language...

1461
00:52:21,210 --> 00:52:23,880
is different
from the Chinese language...

1462
00:52:23,880 --> 00:52:24,880
(That's insane.)

1463
00:52:26,880 --> 00:52:29,810
Thank goodness
I managed to fool Jong Kook.

1464
00:52:29,850 --> 00:52:31,360
Thank goodness.

1465
00:52:31,380 --> 00:52:32,790
- Jong Kook.
- Yes?

1466
00:52:32,790 --> 00:52:34,150
Wasn't I right about Suk Jin?

1467
00:52:34,150 --> 00:52:35,580
Suk Jin is so funny.

1468
00:52:35,580 --> 00:52:37,060
He became a zombie, right?

1469
00:52:37,060 --> 00:52:38,100
Today,

1470
00:52:38,100 --> 00:52:40,100
Suk Jin will have a costume show.

1471
00:52:40,100 --> 00:52:42,520
He can keep coming back to life.

1472
00:52:42,520 --> 00:52:44,560
The bundle contains costumes.

1473
00:52:44,560 --> 00:52:45,770
- That's right.
- It seems that way.

1474
00:52:45,770 --> 00:52:48,000
We should go and eliminate him.

1475
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:50,770
We should go and eliminate him.
Why didn't you take him out?

1476
00:52:52,170 --> 00:52:54,270
(When Jae Suk lowers his guard,)

1477
00:52:55,000 --> 00:52:57,110
(the Poison Needle Sorcerer
uses his superpower.)

1478
00:52:57,940 --> 00:52:58,940
(Jae Suk fell for the same trick.)

1479
00:52:58,940 --> 00:53:00,080
Jong Kook, hurry up.

1480
00:53:00,210 --> 00:53:01,210
For goodness' sake.

1481
00:53:01,210 --> 00:53:03,210
Jong Kook,
let's eliminate him together.

1482
00:53:03,210 --> 00:53:04,750
11, 10...

1483
00:53:04,750 --> 00:53:06,790
You should take him out.

1484
00:53:07,860 --> 00:53:10,420
(Jae Suk is about to be paralyzed.)

1485
00:53:10,420 --> 00:53:11,790
Hey.

1486
00:53:11,790 --> 00:53:12,790
What is going on?

1487
00:53:12,790 --> 00:53:13,790
(Time left until the poison needle
comes into effect)

1488
00:53:14,100 --> 00:53:15,670
One. You are paralyzed.

1489
00:53:15,670 --> 00:53:16,690
You are paralyzed.

1490
00:53:16,690 --> 00:53:18,170
(Jae Suk is paralyzed.)

1491
00:53:18,170 --> 00:53:19,500
One. You are paralyzed.

1492
00:53:19,500 --> 00:53:22,360
(The poison spreads
in Jae Suk's body.)

1493
00:53:22,770 --> 00:53:26,580
(Time left until the effect
is lifted)

1494
00:53:26,670 --> 00:53:28,480
You dirty jerk.

1495
00:53:29,400 --> 00:53:32,020
I will survive...

1496
00:53:32,270 --> 00:53:35,250
I will survive and take you out.

1497
00:53:35,250 --> 00:53:37,150
Jong Kook, help me!

1498
00:53:37,150 --> 00:53:38,420
- I will survive...
- Over here!

1499
00:53:38,420 --> 00:53:39,480
Over here!

1500
00:53:39,480 --> 00:53:41,480
Why can't he take out
a paralyzed person?

1501
00:53:42,460 --> 00:53:43,520
You...

1502
00:53:43,520 --> 00:53:44,520
(Bouncing)

1503
00:53:45,290 --> 00:53:46,520
(But Jae Suk perseveres.)

1504
00:53:46,520 --> 00:53:48,360
- Hey!
- Hey!

1505
00:53:48,690 --> 00:53:50,860
He is too strong.

1506
00:53:51,360 --> 00:53:53,100
He is too strong.

1507
00:53:53,270 --> 00:53:54,830
2, 1,

1508
00:53:54,830 --> 00:53:55,830
- zero.
- Come here.

1509
00:53:55,830 --> 00:53:57,000
- Come here.
- You are no longer paralyzed.

1510
00:53:57,000 --> 00:53:58,830
- Come here.
- Jae Suk, I am sorry.

1511
00:53:59,480 --> 00:54:01,880
Jae Suk, I betrayed you...

1512
00:54:01,880 --> 00:54:03,940
because I was blinded
by the idea of winning.

1513
00:54:03,940 --> 00:54:05,850
- Jae Suk, I am sorry.
- Hey.

1514
00:54:06,650 --> 00:54:09,110
I was blinded
by the idea of winning,

1515
00:54:09,290 --> 00:54:11,250
- so I took my chance.
- How could you do this to me?

1516
00:54:11,690 --> 00:54:15,080
How could you use
2 out of 3 poison needles on me?

1517
00:54:16,020 --> 00:54:17,130
I am sorry.

1518
00:54:17,130 --> 00:54:20,730
How could you use
2 out of 3 poison needles...

1519
00:54:21,230 --> 00:54:22,230
on me?

1520
00:54:22,230 --> 00:54:23,560
I saw a lot of openings.

1521
00:54:23,860 --> 00:54:25,860
Jae Suk, I don't have
any poison needles now.

1522
00:54:26,290 --> 00:54:27,360
I am done for.

1523
00:54:28,460 --> 00:54:30,040
I will stay by your side.

1524
00:54:30,040 --> 00:54:31,830
(By the way)

1525
00:54:32,270 --> 00:54:35,000
Gosh, I can't do anything.

1526
00:54:37,310 --> 00:54:40,040
(Now, the result of the race depends
on the number of chances left.)

1527
00:54:42,850 --> 00:54:44,980
(She finds a ticket
for the Room of Reinforcement!)

1528
00:54:46,080 --> 00:54:48,790
(She looks around
so that no one will take it.)

1529
00:54:51,420 --> 00:54:53,690
(Commoner Ji appears.)

1530
00:54:54,900 --> 00:54:57,100
(So Min doesn't notice him.)

1531
00:54:58,270 --> 00:55:01,040
(He chases after her
with the bouncing bundle.)

1532
00:55:02,540 --> 00:55:03,770
(Startled)

1533
00:55:03,770 --> 00:55:05,310
Suk Jin, Suk Jin. Let's go
to the Room of Reinforcement.

1534
00:55:05,310 --> 00:55:06,330
The Room of Reinforcement?

1535
00:55:06,330 --> 00:55:07,400
- I have a ticket.
- It's time to choose.

1536
00:55:07,400 --> 00:55:09,080
- What?
- It's time to choose.

1537
00:55:09,080 --> 00:55:10,650
With whom will you go
to the Room of Reinforcement?

1538
00:55:10,650 --> 00:55:12,040
- Hurry up. Who will it be?
- Ji Suk Jin.

1539
00:55:12,040 --> 00:55:13,040
Okay. Let's go.

1540
00:55:13,040 --> 00:55:14,380
- Hurry up. Who will it be?
- Ji Suk Jin.

1541
00:55:14,380 --> 00:55:16,080
Okay. Let's go.

1542
00:55:16,480 --> 00:55:17,650
This is great.

1543
00:55:17,650 --> 00:55:19,190
- You found the ticket.
- Can we use the ticket...

1544
00:55:19,190 --> 00:55:20,860
- right away?
- Yes.

1545
00:55:20,860 --> 00:55:22,380
- Hello.
- Hello.

1546
00:55:22,380 --> 00:55:23,460
Hello.

1547
00:55:23,650 --> 00:55:26,230
You entered
the Room of Reinforcement.

1548
00:55:26,230 --> 00:55:28,000
Please choose a random mission.

1549
00:55:29,230 --> 00:55:30,420
I can't fail.

1550
00:55:30,420 --> 00:55:32,170
- Do we choose one each?
- This is bad.

1551
00:55:32,170 --> 00:55:33,830
"Random Vinegar Yogurt Drink".

1552
00:55:33,830 --> 00:55:36,230
"Pick 1 out of 3
yogurt drinks each."

1553
00:55:36,230 --> 00:55:38,330
"You succeed if both members drink
a regular yogurt drink."

1554
00:55:38,330 --> 00:55:39,440
My goodness.

1555
00:55:39,480 --> 00:55:42,170
We can drink a vinegar yogurt drink
as if it's a regular one, right?

1556
00:55:42,170 --> 00:55:43,250
- Yes.
- Okay.

1557
00:55:44,170 --> 00:55:45,250
Please pick one each...

1558
00:55:45,250 --> 00:55:46,650
- Okay.
- and drink.

1559
00:55:46,650 --> 00:55:48,170
Let's do this.

1560
00:55:48,170 --> 00:55:50,190
- You must endure it.
- Please drink it in one go.

1561
00:55:50,190 --> 00:55:51,520
- In one go?
- Yes.

1562
00:55:51,860 --> 00:55:52,860
Please drink it in one go.

1563
00:55:52,860 --> 00:55:55,480
- Cheers. For reinforcement!
- For reinforcement!

1564
00:55:57,330 --> 00:56:00,190
(Will they succeed the mission...)

1565
00:56:00,190 --> 00:56:03,520
(and obtain more chances
to use the superpower?)

1566
00:56:05,770 --> 00:56:07,040
(Throwing up)

1567
00:56:07,540 --> 00:56:09,770
(He picked
the vinegar yogurt drink.)

1568
00:56:11,040 --> 00:56:14,500
Suk Jin,
you should have endured it.

1569
00:56:14,940 --> 00:56:16,150
It was impossible.

1570
00:56:17,710 --> 00:56:18,880
(Bumping into the wall)

1571
00:56:19,480 --> 00:56:20,750
Suk Jin.

1572
00:56:20,750 --> 00:56:22,440
It was so hard for me
to find the ticket.

1573
00:56:23,880 --> 00:56:25,380
Would you give us another chance?

1574
00:56:25,380 --> 00:56:26,750
You failed the mission.

1575
00:56:26,750 --> 00:56:29,830
Please exit the room
and resume with the race.

1576
00:56:29,860 --> 00:56:31,060
What? The race?

1577
00:56:31,250 --> 00:56:32,330
Yes.

1578
00:56:32,330 --> 00:56:34,060
Gosh, why did I pick
the one in the middle?

1579
00:56:37,290 --> 00:56:38,900
(Someone is there!)

1580
00:56:39,270 --> 00:56:40,540
Let's take out that man.

1581
00:56:40,830 --> 00:56:41,860
Suk Jin is weak.

1582
00:56:41,860 --> 00:56:43,540
Why does he keep coming back
to life?

1583
00:56:44,270 --> 00:56:46,630
What are you doing?

1584
00:56:46,670 --> 00:56:48,210
Are you filming a period drama?

1585
00:56:48,210 --> 00:56:50,000
If you touch my clothing,

1586
00:56:50,080 --> 00:56:52,080
you will go straight to your grave.

1587
00:56:52,580 --> 00:56:54,380
Is it a costume show or what?

1588
00:56:54,380 --> 00:56:55,380
No, no.

1589
00:56:55,380 --> 00:56:57,610
Don't make me recite
"Hunminjeongeum".

1590
00:56:57,690 --> 00:57:00,360
- What?
- Don't make me recite it.

1591
00:57:00,880 --> 00:57:01,980
Okay?

1592
00:57:01,980 --> 00:57:03,380
(They ignore his warning.)

1593
00:57:03,650 --> 00:57:06,420
Shall we have Suk Jin change
into another costume?

1594
00:57:06,420 --> 00:57:07,600
(Let's rip off his name tag.)

1595
00:57:07,600 --> 00:57:09,230
(What?)

1596
00:57:09,730 --> 00:57:11,360
- Is there another costume?
- If we rip off his name tag,

1597
00:57:11,360 --> 00:57:12,770
he will change into another costume.

1598
00:57:12,770 --> 00:57:14,100
I am sick and tired of that costume.

1599
00:57:14,100 --> 00:57:16,040
- Okay. Come on.
- Let's see a different costume.

1600
00:57:16,130 --> 00:57:17,810
- Okay.
- Let's see a different costume.

1601
00:57:18,670 --> 00:57:20,000
- But...
- What?

1602
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:21,000
(Everyone figured out
Suk Jin's superpower.)

1603
00:57:21,310 --> 00:57:22,980
The Korean language is different...

1604
00:57:22,980 --> 00:57:26,020
- from the Chinese language...
- He has nothing.

1605
00:57:26,770 --> 00:57:28,250
(He has nothing.)

1606
00:57:30,150 --> 00:57:32,610
And the written words...

1607
00:57:32,960 --> 00:57:34,150
Suk Jin.

1608
00:57:35,080 --> 00:57:36,920
And the spoken words...

1609
00:57:37,080 --> 00:57:39,250
Should I complete the sentence?
Should I?

1610
00:57:39,250 --> 00:57:40,600
- Should I complete the sentence?
- Let's take him out.

1611
00:57:40,600 --> 00:57:42,060
- Should I?
- What was that?

1612
00:57:42,060 --> 00:57:43,100
Was he just saying things?

1613
00:57:43,360 --> 00:57:45,360
(His act doesn't work.)

1614
00:57:46,060 --> 00:57:47,360
Was he just saying things?

1615
00:57:47,360 --> 00:57:49,060
Just rip it off. Rip it off.

1616
00:57:49,060 --> 00:57:51,230
- I will help.
- Just rip it off. Rip it off.

1617
00:57:51,770 --> 00:57:53,040
- Rip it off.
- I helped.

1618
00:57:53,040 --> 00:57:54,940
- I did it.
- I helped.

1619
00:57:54,940 --> 00:57:57,170
(Commoner Ji is out.)

1620
00:57:57,170 --> 00:57:58,380
Suk Jin is out.

1621
00:57:58,380 --> 00:58:00,150
I helped.

1622
00:58:00,150 --> 00:58:01,850
- Is that all?
- Yes.

1623
00:58:01,850 --> 00:58:04,250
Wasn't he using his superpower?

1624
00:58:04,250 --> 00:58:05,710
Is that all?

1625
00:58:05,960 --> 00:58:07,880
Why did you pretend to be scary?

1626
00:58:07,880 --> 00:58:09,420
- I helped.
- Is that all?

1627
00:58:09,420 --> 00:58:10,630
Suk Jin is out.

1628
00:58:11,150 --> 00:58:12,690
Suk Jin is out.

1629
00:58:12,690 --> 00:58:14,020
(Laughing)

1630
00:58:14,520 --> 00:58:16,730
Didn't he get eliminated earlier?

1631
00:58:16,960 --> 00:58:19,360
I thought I heard the same thing
earlier. What's going on?

1632
00:58:20,100 --> 00:58:22,270
Go and change into another costume.
We are sick and tired of this one.

1633
00:58:22,500 --> 00:58:24,440
- Does he have another costume?
- It's a costume show.

1634
00:58:24,500 --> 00:58:25,630
Can he keep coming back that way?

1635
00:58:25,630 --> 00:58:27,380
- He has costumes in that bundle.
- What's his superpower?

1636
00:58:27,380 --> 00:58:28,850
He has costumes.

1637
00:58:29,440 --> 00:58:30,810
Is that all?

1638
00:58:31,610 --> 00:58:32,940
Is he out?

1639
00:58:33,380 --> 00:58:35,310
For goodness' sake.

1640
00:58:35,310 --> 00:58:37,020
It's about time
I wear a different costume.

1641
00:58:37,850 --> 00:58:40,110
Where on earth is Jong Kook?

1642
00:58:41,420 --> 00:58:42,580
(Jong Kook is wandering by himself.)

1643
00:58:42,580 --> 00:58:43,920
I should step away.

1644
00:58:44,250 --> 00:58:45,600
Suk Jin is out.

1645
00:58:47,420 --> 00:58:50,190
After half of them get eliminated,
my time will come.

1646
00:58:50,190 --> 00:58:51,230
(After half of them get eliminated,
my time will come.)

1647
00:58:51,230 --> 00:58:54,400
(Jong Kook makes
a mysterious comment.)

1648
00:58:55,210 --> 00:58:58,170
(Kwang Soo is looking for a ticket
for the Room of Reinforcement.)

1649
00:58:58,170 --> 00:59:00,210
(He spots the cameraman.)

1650
00:59:00,940 --> 00:59:02,480
(Someone must be there.)

1651
00:59:03,210 --> 00:59:06,270
(He approaches carefully.)

1652
00:59:08,210 --> 00:59:09,650
(Peek-a-boo.)

1653
00:59:09,980 --> 00:59:12,020
(His third past life is a beggar
from the Goryeo Dynasty.)

1654
00:59:13,080 --> 00:59:14,190
(Laughing)

1655
00:59:15,580 --> 00:59:17,250
I am a beggar.

1656
00:59:18,060 --> 00:59:20,500
What is up with this getup?

1657
00:59:20,500 --> 00:59:22,670
- I am a beggar.
- How did this happen?

1658
00:59:22,670 --> 00:59:25,690
I don't even have a bundle now.
This is my last life.

1659
00:59:25,690 --> 00:59:27,130
It's over. Are you by yourself?

1660
00:59:27,130 --> 00:59:28,130
Yes.

1661
00:59:28,130 --> 00:59:29,560
Why didn't you team up with someone?

1662
00:59:29,560 --> 00:59:31,810
I didn't team up with anyone
because you are the only one left.

1663
00:59:31,940 --> 00:59:33,380
Would you team up with yourself?
You are a beggar.

1664
00:59:33,380 --> 00:59:34,480
Han Na is coming.

1665
00:59:36,080 --> 00:59:37,940
Why is she walking towards us?

1666
00:59:38,400 --> 00:59:40,110
- She is coming.
- It's Se Chan.

1667
00:59:41,480 --> 00:59:43,420
(Se Chan approaches them quickly
as well.)

1668
00:59:44,110 --> 00:59:45,190
Se Chan is coming.

1669
00:59:46,580 --> 00:59:48,290
Jae Suk is coming too.

1670
00:59:48,290 --> 00:59:49,520
(Jae Suk joins as well.)

1671
00:59:49,520 --> 00:59:50,520
Jae Suk.

1672
00:59:50,880 --> 00:59:52,290
- Suk Jin.
- Yes?

1673
00:59:52,690 --> 00:59:54,250
Is Suk Jin still in the race?

1674
00:59:54,650 --> 00:59:56,290
Listen, everyone.

1675
00:59:56,290 --> 00:59:57,290
Listen.

1676
00:59:57,730 --> 00:59:59,400
Jae Suk, make an announcement.

1677
00:59:59,400 --> 01:00:01,040
An announcement?

1678
01:00:01,040 --> 01:00:02,830
No, no. I won't hear it.

1679
01:00:03,000 --> 01:00:04,040
What?

1680
01:00:04,400 --> 01:00:06,000
What's your superpower?

1681
01:00:06,170 --> 01:00:07,730
(He still doesn't know
what Jae Suk's superpower is.)

1682
01:00:08,670 --> 01:00:09,750
What is it?

1683
01:00:09,750 --> 01:00:10,750
(What should I say
to appear strong?)

1684
01:00:10,750 --> 01:00:12,170
What's your superpower?

1685
01:00:12,880 --> 01:00:14,380
Will you use your superpower on me?

1686
01:00:14,380 --> 01:00:16,420
(What's your superpower?)

1687
01:00:16,420 --> 01:00:18,380
(While they have
a war of nerves...)

1688
01:00:18,380 --> 01:00:19,810
What's your superpower?

1689
01:00:19,810 --> 01:00:21,650
I am sorry. You can pass through.

1690
01:00:21,650 --> 01:00:22,860
I am sorry.

1691
01:00:23,330 --> 01:00:25,860
(Polite)

1692
01:00:25,860 --> 01:00:27,460
- He was waiting.
- I am sorry.

1693
01:00:27,500 --> 01:00:28,900
We were too absorbed. I am sorry.

1694
01:00:28,900 --> 01:00:31,400
I am so embarrassed.
I am so embarrassed!

1695
01:00:31,400 --> 01:00:32,860
I am sorry.

1696
01:00:33,100 --> 01:00:35,270
That was so...
Why didn't you tell me sooner?

1697
01:00:35,270 --> 01:00:37,110
He was watching us.

1698
01:00:37,110 --> 01:00:38,230
His line was the worst.

1699
01:00:38,230 --> 01:00:40,130
- His line was the worst.
- Why didn't you tell me sooner?

1700
01:00:40,310 --> 01:00:41,670
- Seriously.
- He asked,

1701
01:00:41,670 --> 01:00:42,940
"What's your superpower?"

1702
01:00:42,940 --> 01:00:43,980
(Jae Suk's words
were cringeworthy.)

1703
01:00:43,980 --> 01:00:45,770
Why didn't you tell me sooner?

1704
01:00:45,770 --> 01:00:48,170
He seemed flustered.

1705
01:00:48,170 --> 01:00:49,250
He was like, "Who are these guys?"

1706
01:00:49,250 --> 01:00:50,290
Completely...

1707
01:00:50,290 --> 01:00:51,960
(Completely)

1708
01:00:51,960 --> 01:00:53,290
turn me over.

1709
01:00:53,420 --> 01:00:54,860
- That's your superpower?
- What is that?

1710
01:00:55,110 --> 01:00:56,520
- That's fascinating.
- What is that?

1711
01:00:56,520 --> 01:00:57,980
It must be Jae Suk's superpower.

1712
01:00:58,690 --> 01:01:00,190
Who will be the three people?

1713
01:01:00,190 --> 01:01:01,230
Please.

1714
01:01:01,230 --> 01:01:02,860
(3 members of his choice
will pause for 1 minute.)

1715
01:01:03,270 --> 01:01:05,270
(Which three members will be forced
to pause?)

1716
01:01:05,270 --> 01:01:06,500
Once the three members
are announced,

1717
01:01:06,500 --> 01:01:09,040
they will need to pause for 1 minute
after 5 seconds.

1718
01:01:09,170 --> 01:01:10,560
- Do you mean the three members?
- Hold on.

1719
01:01:10,560 --> 01:01:12,730
(Hold on.)

1720
01:01:13,440 --> 01:01:14,980
- These people freeze?
- Yes.

1721
01:01:16,480 --> 01:01:17,580
What's wrong?

1722
01:01:17,580 --> 01:01:18,810
- Did you pick your name?
- Yes.

1723
01:01:18,810 --> 01:01:19,980
(Nodding)

1724
01:01:20,670 --> 01:01:22,310
(He has to freeze himself.)

1725
01:01:22,310 --> 01:01:23,440
Okay!

1726
01:01:23,880 --> 01:01:25,290
(You need luck
to use your superpower.)

1727
01:01:25,290 --> 01:01:26,690
- Come on!
- I mean...

1728
01:01:26,750 --> 01:01:28,790
Han Na, Kwang Soo,
and Jae Suk freeze.

1729
01:01:28,790 --> 01:01:30,190
(Han Na, Kwang Soo,
and Jae Suk freeze.)

1730
01:01:30,190 --> 01:01:32,330
- Do it.
- Han Na, Kwang Soo, and Jae Suk...

1731
01:01:33,060 --> 01:01:34,400
- Who?
- The three of you freeze.

1732
01:01:34,400 --> 01:01:36,670
- Gosh.
- <i>You didn't see me</i>

1733
01:01:36,690 --> 01:01:39,040
(After picking his own name,
Jae Suk runs as fast as he can.)

1734
01:01:39,040 --> 01:01:41,100
<i>You didn't see me, you didn't see me</i>

1735
01:01:41,630 --> 01:01:44,130
(Kwang Soo finally uses
his superpower.)

1736
01:01:44,360 --> 01:01:45,710
(Invisible Man)

1737
01:01:45,710 --> 01:01:46,770
(The cloak makes him invisible and
protects him from all superpowers.)

1738
01:01:46,770 --> 01:01:50,350
(The cloak protects him
from all superpowers.)

1739
01:01:51,380 --> 01:01:52,670
(Hurrying)

1740
01:01:53,610 --> 01:01:55,540
(After a bit of a hassle,)

1741
01:01:55,540 --> 01:01:58,250
(he finally puts on
the invisibility cloak.)

1742
01:02:00,690 --> 01:02:02,230
- What's going on?
- What happened?

1743
01:02:02,860 --> 01:02:04,360
What's going on?

1744
01:02:04,860 --> 01:02:06,000
- What happened?
- What's going on?

1745
01:02:07,100 --> 01:02:09,330
So Min, Kwang Soo is
invisible right now.

1746
01:02:09,330 --> 01:02:10,520
- You can't see him.
- I can't see him?

1747
01:02:11,790 --> 01:02:13,190
Read what's written on my cloak!

1748
01:02:13,190 --> 01:02:14,500
(Viewers, please pretend
you don't see him.)

1749
01:02:14,500 --> 01:02:15,770
(So Min bumps into him.)

1750
01:02:15,770 --> 01:02:16,940
I can't see him?

1751
01:02:16,940 --> 01:02:18,110
You can't see him.

1752
01:02:18,210 --> 01:02:20,880
How can you hit me
when you can't see me?

1753
01:02:22,150 --> 01:02:24,310
- Gosh, that was close.
- Is Han Na out?

1754
01:02:24,940 --> 01:02:26,480
(Jae Suk uses his superpower
on himself.)

1755
01:02:26,480 --> 01:02:27,980
Jae Suk, freeze.

1756
01:02:27,980 --> 01:02:29,080
(He freezes for a minute.)

1757
01:02:29,080 --> 01:02:30,350
- Can I rip her name tag off?
- Han Na, freeze.

1758
01:02:30,350 --> 01:02:32,190
- Can I rip her name tag off?
- Yes, you can.

1759
01:02:32,520 --> 01:02:33,880
- What's going on?
- Really?

1760
01:02:33,880 --> 01:02:35,480
Me?

1761
01:02:35,690 --> 01:02:37,380
- Hey!
- Han Na is out.

1762
01:02:37,520 --> 01:02:39,190
Hey! Han Na!

1763
01:02:39,460 --> 01:02:41,100
How could you do this, Se Chan?

1764
01:02:41,650 --> 01:02:43,330
- Hey!
- Han Na is out.

1765
01:02:43,560 --> 01:02:45,630
- Hey, Han Na!
- How could you...

1766
01:02:45,630 --> 01:02:46,770
- Eliminate Kwang Soo.
- How...

1767
01:02:46,770 --> 01:02:48,040
How could you do this?

1768
01:02:49,170 --> 01:02:50,940
Se Chan, this is not okay.

1769
01:02:50,960 --> 01:02:53,270
I used my superpower for you.

1770
01:02:54,170 --> 01:02:55,650
I used it for you.

1771
01:02:55,980 --> 01:02:58,610
I used my superpower for you.

1772
01:02:59,380 --> 01:03:00,650
Jae Suk, you can move again.

1773
01:03:00,650 --> 01:03:01,750
- Come here.
- Just a second.

1774
01:03:01,750 --> 01:03:02,750
Jae Suk, you can move again.

1775
01:03:02,750 --> 01:03:03,940
- Come here.
- Just a second.

1776
01:03:03,940 --> 01:03:05,210
Hold on.

1777
01:03:05,460 --> 01:03:06,710
Come here.

1778
01:03:06,710 --> 01:03:08,920
- Is Han Na out? Come here.
- Hold on.

1779
01:03:09,080 --> 01:03:12,750
- Come here.
- Can you move again?

1780
01:03:12,920 --> 01:03:15,130
Go, go...

1781
01:03:15,690 --> 01:03:17,190
- So Min is out.
- So Min is out.

1782
01:03:17,190 --> 01:03:18,460
(The Witch of Push and Pull is out.)

1783
01:03:18,730 --> 01:03:20,290
- She's finally out.
- What's with him?

1784
01:03:20,460 --> 01:03:21,730
He's invisible.

1785
01:03:22,000 --> 01:03:23,210
What?

1786
01:03:23,460 --> 01:03:26,440
(We skipped the computer graphics
because it's too much work.)

1787
01:03:26,540 --> 01:03:28,540
(Current Situation)

1788
01:03:28,540 --> 01:03:30,610
(So Min is out.)

1789
01:03:31,710 --> 01:03:32,920
That's a shame.

1790
01:03:32,980 --> 01:03:35,380
I wish I'd gotten a chance
to dance in front of everyone.

1791
01:03:36,040 --> 01:03:37,940
(By the way...)

1792
01:03:37,940 --> 01:03:39,860
Is Jong Kook hiding somewhere?

1793
01:03:40,920 --> 01:03:43,790
(Jong Kook has been on his own
a lot today.)

1794
01:03:46,100 --> 01:03:47,190
What...

1795
01:03:47,190 --> 01:03:49,000
(It looks like he found
something again.)

1796
01:03:52,500 --> 01:03:56,230
(The list of lost items?)

1797
01:03:56,960 --> 01:04:00,980
(It's a list of items
missing from the property room.)

1798
01:04:03,850 --> 01:04:07,170
(He stares at the list
for a moment.)

1799
01:04:12,210 --> 01:04:13,380
This...

1800
01:04:13,380 --> 01:04:15,110
This is dangerous.

1801
01:04:17,060 --> 01:04:20,150
(He tears the lower part
of the paper.)

1802
01:04:20,920 --> 01:04:22,060
This...

1803
01:04:23,560 --> 01:04:26,290
(And he heads somewhere.)

1804
01:04:27,230 --> 01:04:29,270
(There is a mysterious gem.)

1805
01:04:29,270 --> 01:04:31,860
(What is this place?)

1806
01:04:31,940 --> 01:04:35,810
So Min and Han Na,
who have superpowers, are out.

1807
01:04:37,750 --> 01:04:38,770
Thank you.

1808
01:04:38,770 --> 01:04:41,350
(Along with the news of
the two members' elimination,)

1809
01:04:41,350 --> 01:04:43,150
(he receives two gems.)

1810
01:04:43,150 --> 01:04:44,350
Okay.

1811
01:04:44,650 --> 01:04:49,190
(What's the secret of Jong Kook,
who is collecting gems secretly?)

1812
01:04:49,290 --> 01:04:52,630
(Yesterday, Mok-dong SBS)

1813
01:04:52,630 --> 01:04:53,630
(Jong Kook meets the staff alone.)

1814
01:04:53,630 --> 01:04:54,730
Why only me?

1815
01:04:55,860 --> 01:04:57,330
There's only me for real?

1816
01:04:57,330 --> 01:04:58,830
(He suddenly feels uncomfortable.)

1817
01:04:58,960 --> 01:05:00,100
Only me?

1818
01:05:00,600 --> 01:05:01,830
- Jong Kook.
- Yes.

1819
01:05:01,830 --> 01:05:04,360
Normally, you're the strongest
at Name Tag Elimination.

1820
01:05:04,560 --> 01:05:06,940
But once superpowers are involved,

1821
01:05:06,940 --> 01:05:09,770
- you always struggle.
- Right.

1822
01:05:09,770 --> 01:05:11,900
You and Suk Jin are
the only ones who have never won...

1823
01:05:11,900 --> 01:05:14,670
- War of Superpowers.
- That's right.

1824
01:05:15,420 --> 01:05:17,850
Actually, you did even worse
than Suk Jin did.

1825
01:05:17,850 --> 01:05:19,290
(He tells the harsh truth calmly.)

1826
01:05:19,290 --> 01:05:20,860
I was given a useless superpower
every time.

1827
01:05:20,860 --> 01:05:22,380
It only got in my way.

1828
01:05:23,080 --> 01:05:24,520
(One of the superpowers
he had was Wi-Fi.)

1829
01:05:24,520 --> 01:05:27,020
(But the information he got
was not very useful.)

1830
01:05:27,020 --> 01:05:30,190
(Wi-Fi only got in his way.)

1831
01:05:30,920 --> 01:05:32,940
(His true superpower
comes from his muscles.)

1832
01:05:32,940 --> 01:05:35,670
(All his superpowers were useless.)

1833
01:05:37,000 --> 01:05:40,670
(Every time, he just ended up
being cute.)

1834
01:05:40,670 --> 01:05:42,210
All of them were useless.

1835
01:05:42,210 --> 01:05:43,400
So...

1836
01:05:43,880 --> 01:05:47,420
we've concluded that you're
not good with superpowers...

1837
01:05:47,420 --> 01:05:50,080
and deprived you of all superpowers.

1838
01:05:50,310 --> 01:05:51,880
Gosh, this is driving me crazy.

1839
01:05:51,980 --> 01:05:53,960
You've never given me
any superpowers anyway.

1840
01:05:54,520 --> 01:05:56,860
- But you'd still want to fight.
- Right.

1841
01:05:56,860 --> 01:05:58,360
Tomorrow,

1842
01:05:58,360 --> 01:06:01,330
you'll be a human weapon
hidden among those with superpowers.

1843
01:06:01,860 --> 01:06:04,770
You'll use your physical strength
to rip off others' name tags.

1844
01:06:04,770 --> 01:06:06,770
(Eliminate those with superpowers
using your physical strength.)

1845
01:06:06,770 --> 01:06:09,860
(It's his chance to get back at them
and crush their confidence.)

1846
01:06:10,610 --> 01:06:15,330
(The human weapon, Jong Kook,
snuck into Superpower School.)

1847
01:06:15,330 --> 01:06:18,610
(Seniors, please sit down.)

1848
01:06:18,850 --> 01:06:24,440
(But there were only 4 chairs
for seniors.)

1849
01:06:24,650 --> 01:06:26,750
(He gets his own chair.)

1850
01:06:27,190 --> 01:06:30,520
(As he was not invited, he made
all the preparations himself.)

1851
01:06:31,520 --> 01:06:36,020
(Jong Kook pretended to be
a senior at the school.)

1852
01:06:37,000 --> 01:06:39,860
(When the War of Superpowers began,)

1853
01:06:39,860 --> 01:06:42,710
(he damaged the list of lost items
of the school.)

1854
01:06:43,040 --> 01:06:46,130
(1 superpower cloak and
1 communication device are missing.)

1855
01:06:46,480 --> 01:06:48,730
(The lost communication device
was the walkie-talkie he's using.)

1856
01:06:48,730 --> 01:06:51,000
(The lost superpower cloak was
what he wore at the ceremony.)

1857
01:06:51,380 --> 01:06:56,440
(The human weapon has been
waiting for his moment.)

1858
01:06:57,440 --> 01:07:00,650
- There's one condition.
- What is it?

1859
01:07:00,860 --> 01:07:04,690
Every time a person with
a superpower is eliminated,

1860
01:07:04,690 --> 01:07:06,860
you'll receive a gem.

1861
01:07:07,190 --> 01:07:10,600
The gems you receive will be
kept in the human weapon's room.

1862
01:07:10,770 --> 01:07:11,960
Okay.

1863
01:07:13,000 --> 01:07:15,460
Once you've collected five gems,

1864
01:07:15,630 --> 01:07:18,040
you can start eliminating
those with superpowers.

1865
01:07:18,040 --> 01:07:19,270
Once I've collected five?

1866
01:07:19,270 --> 01:07:23,150
(He can get into action
when 5 members are out.)

1867
01:07:24,110 --> 01:07:27,920
(He gave away superpower points
because he didn't need them.)

1868
01:07:27,920 --> 01:07:31,610
(He won everyone's trust
by pretending to be generous.)

1869
01:07:31,880 --> 01:07:35,860
(Even when his prey came near...)

1870
01:07:35,860 --> 01:07:37,630
(Let's eliminate him together!)

1871
01:07:38,230 --> 01:07:40,730
(He waited for his moment.)

1872
01:07:40,730 --> 01:07:42,920
(I can't eliminate him anyway.)

1873
01:07:43,230 --> 01:07:46,830
(When everyone else
was given a superpower...)

1874
01:07:47,230 --> 01:07:49,360
Please read out
your fake superpower.

1875
01:07:50,940 --> 01:07:52,830
(He pretended...)

1876
01:07:52,830 --> 01:07:57,080
(that his superpower was Wi-Fi.)

1877
01:07:58,880 --> 01:08:00,110
I don't have to eavesdrop.

1878
01:08:01,150 --> 01:08:02,520
There's no point.

1879
01:08:03,080 --> 01:08:04,190
I'm only human.

1880
01:08:07,250 --> 01:08:10,460
Why can't they eliminate
each other faster?

1881
01:08:11,290 --> 01:08:12,650
Gosh.

1882
01:08:13,020 --> 01:08:14,130
Hey.

1883
01:08:14,330 --> 01:08:16,290
Let's eliminate Suk Jin first.

1884
01:08:16,830 --> 01:08:18,290
Let's eliminate him.

1885
01:08:18,460 --> 01:08:19,860
(Se Chan can use
his superpower only once now.)

1886
01:08:19,860 --> 01:08:21,230
- We're a team now.
- Yes.

1887
01:08:21,670 --> 01:08:22,710
Let's go.

1888
01:08:22,710 --> 01:08:25,060
(Their target is
the Goryeo beggar, Suk Jin.)

1889
01:08:25,110 --> 01:08:26,230
You should be more into it.

1890
01:08:26,400 --> 01:08:28,770
(But...)

1891
01:08:29,650 --> 01:08:32,070
(Jae Suk is shot
with a poison needle again.)

1892
01:08:32,280 --> 01:08:33,650
(It's almost like he collects them.)

1893
01:08:33,650 --> 01:08:35,880
You've been shot
by the Poison Needle Sorcerer.

1894
01:08:35,880 --> 01:08:38,820
In 15 seconds,
you'll freeze for 30 seconds.

1895
01:08:39,190 --> 01:08:41,710
- 15, 14, 13...
- Again?

1896
01:08:42,120 --> 01:08:43,560
- You...
- Let's run!

1897
01:08:43,950 --> 01:08:47,250
(Seeing him run away
is getting old.)

1898
01:08:47,320 --> 01:08:49,400
(Time left until the poison needle
comes into effect)

1899
01:08:49,460 --> 01:08:51,200
- This is my last chance.
- How could you do this?

1900
01:08:51,460 --> 01:08:53,370
- I have to eliminate him.
- How could you?

1901
01:08:53,370 --> 01:08:54,740
- How could you...
- Now.

1902
01:08:54,870 --> 01:08:57,000
- Se Chan...
- This is my last chance.

1903
01:08:57,000 --> 01:08:58,830
Lift him. 1, 2, 3.

1904
01:08:58,830 --> 01:09:00,130
Lift him. We have to.

1905
01:09:00,280 --> 01:09:01,980
1, 2, 3. This is my last chance.

1906
01:09:01,980 --> 01:09:03,810
- He's out.
- It's over.

1907
01:09:04,350 --> 01:09:07,150
(Jae Suk is out.)

1908
01:09:07,150 --> 01:09:08,620
You filthy jerks.

1909
01:09:08,870 --> 01:09:10,240
You little...

1910
01:09:10,380 --> 01:09:12,280
- Jae Suk is out.
- Jae Suk is out.

1911
01:09:12,280 --> 01:09:14,120
Hey, how could you do this?

1912
01:09:14,190 --> 01:09:15,780
I shot you three times.

1913
01:09:17,120 --> 01:09:18,160
Hey.

1914
01:09:18,660 --> 01:09:20,030
Gosh.

1915
01:09:20,030 --> 01:09:21,120
Can you see me?

1916
01:09:22,820 --> 01:09:24,230
Yes, I can.

1917
01:09:24,570 --> 01:09:25,700
You can't see me.

1918
01:09:26,030 --> 01:09:27,330
- You can't see me.
- Gosh.

1919
01:09:27,330 --> 01:09:28,460
(This is so annoying.)

1920
01:09:28,460 --> 01:09:29,630
This is unbelievable.

1921
01:09:30,310 --> 01:09:33,480
You shot 3 out of 4 needles at me?

1922
01:09:34,110 --> 01:09:36,200
Jae Suk, I had no choice.

1923
01:09:36,450 --> 01:09:37,610
Where should I go?

1924
01:09:37,610 --> 01:09:39,210
(The news makes someone happy.)

1925
01:09:39,210 --> 01:09:40,710
Wait a minute,
I'm starting to have hope.

1926
01:09:41,210 --> 01:09:42,280
I'm starting to...

1927
01:09:42,450 --> 01:09:43,820
(It's time to get ready.)

1928
01:09:43,820 --> 01:09:45,040
I'm starting to have hope.

1929
01:09:45,540 --> 01:09:48,080
(With Jae Suk out,)

1930
01:09:48,080 --> 01:09:49,120
(he receives the fourth gem.)

1931
01:09:49,120 --> 01:09:50,160
Okay.

1932
01:09:50,450 --> 01:09:51,530
There you go.

1933
01:09:51,860 --> 01:09:53,560
(Once he receives another gem,)

1934
01:09:53,560 --> 01:09:57,660
(the human weapon
can get into action.)

1935
01:09:58,620 --> 01:10:00,790
(Just then...)

1936
01:10:01,460 --> 01:10:03,910
Sang Yeob is out.

1937
01:10:03,910 --> 01:10:07,610
(Sang Yeob is out?)

1938
01:10:07,610 --> 01:10:10,410
You'll be given one more gem
and a ring.

1939
01:10:10,410 --> 01:10:12,170
(Finally, five members are out.)

1940
01:10:12,520 --> 01:10:13,950
(Se Chan and Kwang Soo
eliminated Sang Yeob together.)

1941
01:10:13,950 --> 01:10:15,020
Kwang Soo!

1942
01:10:15,320 --> 01:10:16,520
Sang Yeob is out.

1943
01:10:17,040 --> 01:10:18,080
(While those with superpowers
are distracted...)

1944
01:10:18,080 --> 01:10:19,490
Sang Yeob is out.

1945
01:10:20,410 --> 01:10:21,860
(The human weapon is
about to get into action.)

1946
01:10:21,860 --> 01:10:22,950
Finally.

1947
01:10:23,690 --> 01:10:24,820
Finally.

1948
01:10:24,820 --> 01:10:26,030
(Jong Kook's goal is to win
without any superpowers.)

1949
01:10:26,030 --> 01:10:27,160
Finally.

1950
01:10:27,900 --> 01:10:29,900
(He is given the fifth gem.)

1951
01:10:29,900 --> 01:10:31,070
All right.

1952
01:10:32,770 --> 01:10:35,830
(The human weapon is in action.)

1953
01:10:37,130 --> 01:10:41,280
(He can now hunt down
those with superpowers.)

1954
01:10:41,280 --> 01:10:42,950
(The school's intruder alarm
goes off.)

1955
01:10:42,950 --> 01:10:44,350
What's going on?

1956
01:10:44,700 --> 01:10:47,650
There's an intruder in the school.

1957
01:10:48,150 --> 01:10:50,880
- There's an intruder in the school.
- An intruder?

1958
01:10:51,210 --> 01:10:52,350
There's another person?

1959
01:10:52,910 --> 01:10:54,880
- An intruder?
- Kwang Soo.

1960
01:10:55,210 --> 01:10:56,920
- What's going on?
- Who's the intruder?

1961
01:10:57,560 --> 01:10:58,690
There's an intruder.

1962
01:10:58,950 --> 01:11:00,750
Did someone use a superpower
to bring someone in?

1963
01:11:00,750 --> 01:11:02,530
- No.
- Or did someone just show up?

1964
01:11:02,530 --> 01:11:04,160
Someone broke into the school.

1965
01:11:04,370 --> 01:11:05,700
There's an intruder in the school.

1966
01:11:05,700 --> 01:11:06,870
- What does that mean?
- There's another person?

1967
01:11:07,400 --> 01:11:09,870
- Is it someone new?
- I know. Who could it be?

1968
01:11:10,000 --> 01:11:12,270
Should I get ready
to go back out there?

1969
01:11:13,000 --> 01:11:14,170
What are you talking about?

1970
01:11:14,700 --> 01:11:16,310
Why are you preparing to go out,
Han Na?

1971
01:11:16,310 --> 01:11:18,040
Is it time for us to step up?

1972
01:11:18,450 --> 01:11:19,850
There's no place for us to go.

1973
01:11:19,850 --> 01:11:22,020
Oh, so we're completely done.

1974
01:11:22,020 --> 01:11:24,210
(Meanwhile, Haha is...)

1975
01:11:25,210 --> 01:11:26,380
I'm sorry, sir.

1976
01:11:26,490 --> 01:11:27,710
They're looking at me.

1977
01:11:28,780 --> 01:11:30,820
(Haha takes a look around.)

1978
01:11:34,100 --> 01:11:37,120
(He finds the list of lost items
that Jong Kook ripped.)

1979
01:11:37,120 --> 01:11:38,600
Someone ripped this, right?

1980
01:11:38,600 --> 01:11:39,830
(Superpower cloak,
19 in stock, 1 lost)

1981
01:11:39,830 --> 01:11:41,200
There is an intruder.

1982
01:11:41,330 --> 01:11:43,270
An intruder. There's an intruder.

1983
01:11:43,500 --> 01:11:44,910
Who is the intruder?

1984
01:11:45,460 --> 01:11:47,480
Hold on. How can I use this?
Hold on.

1985
01:11:48,240 --> 01:11:51,310
<i>From my head to my toes</i>

1986
01:11:51,610 --> 01:11:52,650
(Suk Jin is enjoying
his last past life.)

1987
01:11:52,650 --> 01:11:54,150
Kwang Soo has
an invisibility cloak.

1988
01:11:54,740 --> 01:11:55,780
You've been summoned...

1989
01:11:55,780 --> 01:11:56,880
- to the Room of Reinforcement.
- I have?

1990
01:11:56,880 --> 01:11:57,880
You've been summoned...

1991
01:11:57,880 --> 01:11:58,950
- to the Room of Reinforcement.
- I have?

1992
01:11:58,950 --> 01:12:00,210
- Okay.
- Please follow us to the room.

1993
01:12:00,210 --> 01:12:01,210
Where is the Room of Reinforcement?

1994
01:12:01,210 --> 01:12:02,380
It's in the main building.

1995
01:12:02,620 --> 01:12:03,730
The cafeteria?

1996
01:12:03,860 --> 01:12:05,030
How nice.

1997
01:12:05,420 --> 01:12:06,490
I should go first.

1998
01:12:06,490 --> 01:12:08,600
(He enters the Room of Reinforcement
in hopes for a better past life.)

1999
01:12:11,730 --> 01:12:14,960
(Soon after, the person who invited
him to the room enters.)

2000
01:12:14,960 --> 01:12:17,110
(The person who invited him was...)

2001
01:12:17,110 --> 01:12:19,310
- Okay.
- Okay. Thank you.

2002
01:12:19,310 --> 01:12:20,330
Suk Jin.

2003
01:12:22,870 --> 01:12:24,570
(The human weapon summoned Suk Jin
with the ticket he found...)

2004
01:12:24,570 --> 01:12:25,650
(in the beginning.)

2005
01:12:25,870 --> 01:12:28,780
(The reason why he called Suk Jin
to the Room of Reinforcement is...)

2006
01:12:28,780 --> 01:12:30,280
(the Room of Reinforcement is
a safe zone for them.)

2007
01:12:30,280 --> 01:12:31,490
(Warning:
This is the Room of Reinforcement.)

2008
01:12:31,490 --> 01:12:33,280
(Those with superpowers cannot
rip name tags here.)

2009
01:12:33,750 --> 01:12:36,030
(However, the human weapon,
Jong Kook,)

2010
01:12:36,030 --> 01:12:38,280
(can rip off name tags as
he doesn't have superpowers.)

2011
01:12:40,290 --> 01:12:42,530
(That's why Suk Jin,
who dreams of a new life...)

2012
01:12:42,530 --> 01:12:44,620
- Did you get it?
- No, not yet.

2013
01:12:44,620 --> 01:12:45,770
- Okay.
- Yes!

2014
01:12:45,770 --> 01:12:46,790
What was that?

2015
01:12:46,790 --> 01:12:47,830
- Did you get it?
- No, not yet.

2016
01:12:47,830 --> 01:12:50,000
(was eliminated in
the Room of Reinforcement.)

2017
01:12:51,110 --> 01:12:52,270
Okay.

2018
01:12:52,610 --> 01:12:53,810
- Why?
- He's out.

2019
01:12:54,200 --> 01:12:55,310
Okay.

2020
01:12:55,310 --> 01:12:57,000
But this is
the Room of Reinforcement.

2021
01:12:57,410 --> 01:12:59,000
You can't rip off name tags here.

2022
01:12:59,000 --> 01:13:01,350
The intruder of Superpower School,
the human weapon,

2023
01:13:01,350 --> 01:13:03,040
- has started to move.
- What?

2024
01:13:03,040 --> 01:13:05,120
The intruder of Superpower School,
the human weapon,

2025
01:13:05,120 --> 01:13:06,780
- has started to move.
- What?

2026
01:13:06,780 --> 01:13:08,060
(The human weapon?)

2027
01:13:08,360 --> 01:13:10,030
(Frozen)

2028
01:13:10,030 --> 01:13:11,880
He must be the human weapon.

2029
01:13:11,880 --> 01:13:13,420
I'm the human weapon.

2030
01:13:13,700 --> 01:13:16,990
I'm a human being
who doesn't have a superpower.

2031
01:13:16,990 --> 01:13:18,370
You're a human being,

2032
01:13:18,370 --> 01:13:19,400
who defeats...

2033
01:13:19,400 --> 01:13:20,990
- those with superpowers?
- Yes.

2034
01:13:20,990 --> 01:13:22,810
The intruder of Superpower School,
the human weapon,

2035
01:13:22,810 --> 01:13:24,200
has started to move.

2036
01:13:25,200 --> 01:13:26,500
Who's the human weapon?

2037
01:13:29,810 --> 01:13:32,310
I have a feeling they'll know
that it's me.

2038
01:13:32,540 --> 01:13:34,670
Because nobody knows
my superpower.

2039
01:13:35,410 --> 01:13:38,210
Jong Kook.
I found the list of lost items.

2040
01:13:38,210 --> 01:13:40,080
- What is that?
- Come down here.

2041
01:13:40,080 --> 01:13:41,560
- What?
- You have to trust me.

2042
01:13:41,560 --> 01:13:43,420
I'm the original. Jong Kook.

2043
01:13:43,420 --> 01:13:45,060
- Okay.
- We're brothers, remember?

2044
01:13:45,060 --> 01:13:46,400
- Come down.
- Okay. Just wait.

2045
01:13:47,820 --> 01:13:49,420
I have chills.

2046
01:13:50,030 --> 01:13:51,200
My gosh.

2047
01:13:51,490 --> 01:13:52,870
This is dangerous.

2048
01:13:52,870 --> 01:13:54,940
- Jong Kook.
- What's going on?

2049
01:13:54,940 --> 01:13:56,200
Your superpower is...

2050
01:13:56,200 --> 01:13:57,770
- You have superpowers, right?
- Right.

2051
01:13:57,770 --> 01:13:59,130
- Take a look.
- Okay.

2052
01:13:59,130 --> 01:14:00,980
Remember how we all wore
cloaks during the opening?

2053
01:14:00,980 --> 01:14:02,030
- Right.
- Take a look.

2054
01:14:02,030 --> 01:14:04,500
One of the cloaks is missing.
It says one is lost.

2055
01:14:04,500 --> 01:14:07,570
What did they say about
the human weapon?

2056
01:14:07,570 --> 01:14:08,870
- They said they intruded, right?
- Right.

2057
01:14:08,870 --> 01:14:10,280
There's a human among us.

2058
01:14:10,780 --> 01:14:13,660
(Haha, Kwang Soo, and Se Chan,
who have powers, are left.)

2059
01:14:13,660 --> 01:14:16,080
(Jong Kook is in trouble
if he gets caught now.)

2060
01:14:16,080 --> 01:14:17,280
This punk... Oh, my.

2061
01:14:17,280 --> 01:14:18,420
I mean, this person.

2062
01:14:18,750 --> 01:14:20,900
I'm sorry. I got overexcited.

2063
01:14:20,900 --> 01:14:22,200
I felt victimized.

2064
01:14:22,200 --> 01:14:25,270
This young, little kid...

2065
01:14:25,270 --> 01:14:29,030
stole a cloak and entered the school
while pretending he has powers.

2066
01:14:29,160 --> 01:14:30,740
- But look.
- Who could it be?

2067
01:14:30,740 --> 01:14:32,870
- You have superpowers, right?
- Honestly...

2068
01:14:32,870 --> 01:14:34,610
- Right.
- I have superpowers too.

2069
01:14:34,610 --> 01:14:36,310
What was my chant again?

2070
01:14:36,310 --> 01:14:37,570
Was it "Tiramisu"?

2071
01:14:37,780 --> 01:14:39,200
What was it again? Anyways.

2072
01:14:39,200 --> 01:14:41,070
- I have this, my superpower.
- Okay.

2073
01:14:41,070 --> 01:14:42,570
- And Kwang Soo is invisible.
- Right.

2074
01:14:42,990 --> 01:14:44,450
Then who's left?

2075
01:14:44,620 --> 01:14:46,860
- Does the last person have a power?
- Se Chan?

2076
01:14:46,860 --> 01:14:49,060
- Se Chan has a water gun.
- All he has is a water gun.

2077
01:14:49,730 --> 01:14:54,420
- That's just a gun.
- Okay.

2078
01:14:54,420 --> 01:14:57,270
All he has is that water gun,

2079
01:14:57,270 --> 01:14:59,370
but we were fighting
among ourselves.

2080
01:14:59,440 --> 01:15:01,630
And you were won over by him!

2081
01:15:01,900 --> 01:15:03,330
He's fake!

2082
01:15:04,530 --> 01:15:05,610
Let's eliminate him.

2083
01:15:06,480 --> 01:15:07,610
What is this?

2084
01:15:07,610 --> 01:15:09,200
This isn't it. What is it?

2085
01:15:10,000 --> 01:15:12,540
(He finds something with
an R Sticker on it.)

2086
01:15:12,540 --> 01:15:14,040
It's a certificate of admission.

2087
01:15:14,040 --> 01:15:15,520
(Is it a 2019 Superpower School
certificate of admissions?)

2088
01:15:15,520 --> 01:15:18,020
(Name: Haha)

2089
01:15:18,450 --> 01:15:19,520
Haha.

2090
01:15:19,520 --> 01:15:20,620
(It looks like the certificate
of admissions for the 2nd years.)

2091
01:15:20,620 --> 01:15:21,780
Ji Hyo.

2092
01:15:22,490 --> 01:15:23,730
Jae Suk.

2093
01:15:23,730 --> 01:15:26,160
(Certificate of Admissions)

2094
01:15:26,160 --> 01:15:28,600
(Name: Kim Jong Kook)

2095
01:15:29,320 --> 01:15:30,370
What?

2096
01:15:31,790 --> 01:15:33,700
Jong Kook's certificate
doesn't have a stamp on it.

2097
01:15:34,570 --> 01:15:37,700
(There is a stamp marked on
four of the certificates.)

2098
01:15:38,070 --> 01:15:40,610
(However, Jong Kook's certificate
does not have a stamp on it.)

2099
01:15:40,610 --> 01:15:41,780
I just got chills.

2100
01:15:42,070 --> 01:15:43,850
Jong Kook is the human weapon.

2101
01:15:44,110 --> 01:15:45,370
I have to let the others know...

2102
01:15:45,540 --> 01:15:47,070
before anyone else gets eliminated.

2103
01:15:48,570 --> 01:15:49,880
- Hey.
- Yes?

2104
01:15:49,880 --> 01:15:50,910
Come here.

2105
01:15:50,910 --> 01:15:52,410
- Hey, Yang Se Chan.
- Come here.

2106
01:15:52,410 --> 01:15:54,710
- Yes?
- My goodness, Yang Se Chan.

2107
01:15:54,820 --> 01:15:56,280
Come here. Stand right here.

2108
01:15:56,420 --> 01:15:58,380
- Are you starting again?
- I said, stand over there!

2109
01:15:58,490 --> 01:15:59,560
Why? What's wrong?

2110
01:15:59,560 --> 01:16:01,530
You were entrusted with something
big after 10 years, weren't you?

2111
01:16:01,530 --> 01:16:02,700
Who was?

2112
01:16:02,700 --> 01:16:04,160
They're going to entrust
someone like me...

2113
01:16:04,160 --> 01:16:06,660
with a big project like this?
That makes no sense.

2114
01:16:06,660 --> 01:16:08,460
- Do you know why you're fake?
- Why is that?

2115
01:16:08,990 --> 01:16:10,530
Jong Kook and I...

2116
01:16:10,700 --> 01:16:12,530
have been friends for over 20 years,
you punk.

2117
01:16:13,530 --> 01:16:14,830
You fake punk.

2118
01:16:14,830 --> 01:16:17,650
(You're the fake intruder
who came in between us.)

2119
01:16:17,650 --> 01:16:19,280
- Big brother!
- Okay.

2120
01:16:19,370 --> 01:16:20,480
Do you want to go?

2121
01:16:20,480 --> 01:16:21,710
(Do you want a taste
of my poison needles?)

2122
01:16:21,710 --> 01:16:23,240
Do you want to go?

2123
01:16:24,040 --> 01:16:27,210
Se Chan, if you've enjoyed yourself,
it's time to sacrifice yourself.

2124
01:16:27,490 --> 01:16:29,020
But Jong Kook, seriously...

2125
01:16:29,020 --> 01:16:30,360
I will sacrifice myself. I will.

2126
01:16:30,360 --> 01:16:33,600
- I'll make it quick.
- Do it so there will be a CG on it.

2127
01:16:33,600 --> 01:16:36,290
Please put some graphics
on my name tag.

2128
01:16:36,290 --> 01:16:37,770
(Yang Se Chan)

2129
01:16:37,870 --> 01:16:39,940
(Due to the work overload
of the CG team,)

2130
01:16:39,940 --> 01:16:41,940
(we couldn't fulfill
Se Chan's dying wish.)

2131
01:16:41,940 --> 01:16:44,630
(Poison Needle Sorcerer is out.)

2132
01:16:45,240 --> 01:16:47,330
- Let me see.
- I'm nothing.

2133
01:16:47,330 --> 01:16:49,370
Then you should've told us
that you weren't more aggressively.

2134
01:16:50,000 --> 01:16:51,870
- I told you I wasn't.
- What is going on here?

2135
01:16:51,870 --> 01:16:54,850
Are you saying
it's the Invisible Man?

2136
01:16:54,850 --> 01:16:55,910
(He's making a wrong guess.)

2137
01:16:57,850 --> 01:17:00,660
- It must be Kwang Soo.
- The human weapon is on the move.

2138
01:17:00,660 --> 01:17:01,860
(It must be Kwang Soo.)

2139
01:17:01,860 --> 01:17:03,490
Jong Kook. Hold on.

2140
01:17:03,490 --> 01:17:04,860
- Hold on.
- Be careful.

2141
01:17:05,580 --> 01:17:06,790
Hold on. Is it you?

2142
01:17:06,790 --> 01:17:08,200
Are you insane?

2143
01:17:08,200 --> 01:17:11,460
He just said that the human
is on the move!

2144
01:17:11,770 --> 01:17:12,770
Haha.

2145
01:17:12,770 --> 01:17:13,790
(Kwang Soo appears at that moment.)

2146
01:17:13,790 --> 01:17:15,490
- Do you know who the intruder is?
- Who is it?

2147
01:17:15,490 --> 01:17:16,740
Do you know who the intruder is?

2148
01:17:16,740 --> 01:17:18,130
(Flustered)

2149
01:17:19,670 --> 01:17:20,670
It's Jong Kook.

2150
01:17:20,670 --> 01:17:21,980
What are you saying?

2151
01:17:22,240 --> 01:17:24,170
- It's Jong Kook.
- What are you saying?

2152
01:17:24,450 --> 01:17:25,540
You're really...

2153
01:17:25,540 --> 01:17:26,710
(Completely flustered)

2154
01:17:26,710 --> 01:17:28,150
- I found a hint.
- Let me see.

2155
01:17:28,150 --> 01:17:29,320
- What hint?
- I took a picture of it...

2156
01:17:29,320 --> 01:17:30,520
because I knew
you wouldn't believe me.

2157
01:17:30,850 --> 01:17:32,520
Haha, get ready.

2158
01:17:32,520 --> 01:17:34,880
(The battle will look very different
according to Haha's choice.)

2159
01:17:34,880 --> 01:17:38,160
(Who will be the final winner?)

2160
01:17:38,160 --> 01:17:39,750
I will tell you the results.

2161
01:17:39,750 --> 01:17:43,160
The 10th anniversary
War of Superpowers: The End Game...

2162
01:17:43,160 --> 01:17:44,990
was a chance for Jong Kook,

2163
01:17:44,990 --> 01:17:46,700
who always got low rankings...

2164
01:17:46,700 --> 01:17:48,330
- during superpower races,
- Right.

2165
01:17:48,330 --> 01:17:50,960
to have no superpowers
and participate in the race.

2166
01:17:51,830 --> 01:17:53,410
- He was just a human?
- But...

2167
01:17:53,410 --> 01:17:55,480
- I didn't have anything today,
- Really?

2168
01:17:55,480 --> 01:17:56,980
and I had to wait until
five members were eliminated.

2169
01:17:56,980 --> 01:17:59,070
You didn't have anything, but you
were terrifying with the gloves on.

2170
01:17:59,070 --> 01:18:00,320
- I was at a serious disadvantage.
- In the end,

2171
01:18:00,320 --> 01:18:01,780
Haha and Kwang Soo...

2172
01:18:01,780 --> 01:18:03,380
(Jong Kook worked among those
with superpowers.)

2173
01:18:03,380 --> 01:18:05,710
In the end, Haha and Kwang Soo...

2174
01:18:05,710 --> 01:18:09,660
(What were the results of the final
match between the three of them?)

2175
01:18:09,660 --> 01:18:12,450
ripped off Jong Kook's name tag,
and those with superpowers won.

2176
01:18:12,450 --> 01:18:13,750
We won because we didn't
betray each other.

2177
01:18:13,750 --> 01:18:14,860
ripped off Jong Kook's name tag...

2178
01:18:17,820 --> 01:18:19,070
Seriously?

2179
01:18:19,070 --> 01:18:20,130
(Team Superpowers won
thanks to Haha and Kwang Soo.)

2180
01:18:20,130 --> 01:18:21,660
- I feel like...
- I'm so touched.

2181
01:18:21,660 --> 01:18:22,960
I'm going to cry.

2182
01:18:22,960 --> 01:18:25,110
(Earlier, Haha and Kwang Soo
were facing off with Jong Kook.)

2183
01:18:25,110 --> 01:18:26,440
Kim Jong Kook, Gravity!

2184
01:18:27,980 --> 01:18:31,070
(Haha used his last chance.)

2185
01:18:35,040 --> 01:18:37,040
(The 2 scaredy cats joined forces.)

2186
01:18:37,040 --> 01:18:38,120
Grab him!

2187
01:18:38,410 --> 01:18:41,120
(However, the human weapon
is a strong match.)

2188
01:18:41,910 --> 01:18:44,950
(The two of them just barely
ripped off his name tag.)

2189
01:18:46,450 --> 01:18:48,750
(They're overly emotional
and praising themselves.)

2190
01:18:48,820 --> 01:18:51,490
- These weasels...
- I'm serious...

2191
01:18:51,490 --> 01:18:52,700
I'm serious today.

2192
01:18:53,070 --> 01:18:55,990
- What about me?
- You used 3 of your 4 powers on me?

2193
01:18:56,160 --> 01:18:58,910
So the punishment that Jong Kook
must do for losing the race...

2194
01:18:58,910 --> 01:19:01,170
during the 10th anniversary
live broadcast is...

2195
01:19:01,170 --> 01:19:02,410
What is it?

2196
01:19:02,410 --> 01:19:04,980
(What is the punishment that must
be done during the live broadcast?)

2197
01:19:04,980 --> 01:19:06,320
He must put on a costume.

2198
01:19:06,320 --> 01:19:07,480
Oh, my.

2199
01:19:08,120 --> 01:19:09,170
During a live broadcast?

2200
01:19:09,170 --> 01:19:11,350
He will be joined by another member
who will be chosen next week,

2201
01:19:11,350 --> 01:19:13,380
and the two of them must put on
a costume for the live broadcast.

2202
01:19:13,380 --> 01:19:15,280
Two people?
So someone else will also do it.

2203
01:19:16,280 --> 01:19:17,580
Thank goodness for now.

2204
01:19:17,580 --> 01:19:18,780
- I had no idea.
- Okay.

2205
01:19:18,780 --> 01:19:20,900
Over the course of 10 years,

2206
01:19:21,450 --> 01:19:23,770
the eight of you... I'm sorry.
He was yawning.

2207
01:19:23,770 --> 01:19:25,290
- Why are you yawning now?
- What are you doing?

2208
01:19:25,290 --> 01:19:27,790
(He just yawned
for everyone to see.)

2209
01:19:27,790 --> 01:19:29,370
- Why are you yawning now?
- What are you doing?

2210
01:19:29,830 --> 01:19:31,030
- But...
- Why are you yawning?

2211
01:19:31,030 --> 01:19:33,130
I know I need to put on a costume
as a penalty,

2212
01:19:33,130 --> 01:19:35,030
but what about Suk Jin, who had
to dress up four times today?

2213
01:19:35,030 --> 01:19:37,980
I'm exhausted
after living three lifetimes.

2214
01:19:38,280 --> 01:19:40,850
The candidates for Jong Kook's
costume punishment are...

2215
01:19:41,150 --> 01:19:44,190
one of each of your costumes
in the past, which you will suggest,

2216
01:19:44,490 --> 01:19:46,710
and four new ones suggested by
the crew.

2217
01:19:46,710 --> 01:19:49,250
You must choose 1 of the 12.

2218
01:19:49,410 --> 01:19:52,280
- I think they'll be bad.
- Suggest one of your past costumes.

2219
01:19:52,280 --> 01:19:53,560
- Something that Jong Kook could do.
- Okay.

2220
01:19:53,750 --> 01:19:55,560
The doll? That's too weak.

2221
01:19:55,560 --> 01:19:56,920
- A giraffe is too weak.
- A mummy's not good enough.

2222
01:19:56,920 --> 01:19:59,030
I'll choose the llama.

2223
01:19:59,120 --> 01:20:00,570
- What about the beggar?
- I chose the llama.

2224
01:20:00,570 --> 01:20:01,600
I choose Kaonashi.

2225
01:20:01,600 --> 01:20:02,660
I choose Yondu.

2226
01:20:02,660 --> 01:20:04,070
Yondu is a good one.

2227
01:20:04,070 --> 01:20:06,410
(The costumes chosen by the members,
the costumes chosen by the staff)

2228
01:20:06,410 --> 01:20:08,310
Okay. Jong Kook, please choose one.

2229
01:20:08,310 --> 01:20:09,370
Okay.

2230
01:20:09,370 --> 01:20:10,650
Are you going to do
the one you choose?

2231
01:20:10,650 --> 01:20:11,740
What is it?

2232
01:20:11,740 --> 01:20:13,280
(This is the big data of costumes
accumulated over 10 years.)

2233
01:20:13,280 --> 01:20:17,850
(Among the many costumes, which one
will be chosen by Jong Kook?)

2234
01:20:17,850 --> 01:20:19,120
It's Kaonashi.

2235
01:20:19,120 --> 01:20:20,380
- What is it?
- It's Kaonashi.

2236
01:20:21,250 --> 01:20:22,450
(This is the best one
out of all of them.)

2237
01:20:22,450 --> 01:20:23,690
This is it. Okay!

2238
01:20:23,690 --> 01:20:24,730
This one is not that bad.

2239
01:20:24,730 --> 01:20:25,950
- This is not that bad.
- This is not that bad.

2240
01:20:25,950 --> 01:20:27,030
Kaonashi.

2241
01:20:27,200 --> 01:20:29,530
- Okay.
- Kaonashi is cute.

2242
01:20:29,530 --> 01:20:31,160
I wanted to do something cute.

2243
01:20:31,290 --> 01:20:33,070
Are we choosing another person
next week?

2244
01:20:33,070 --> 01:20:34,270
- Yes, that's right.
- Okay. Good.

2245
01:20:34,330 --> 01:20:35,600
Please say something, Sang Yeob.

2246
01:20:35,600 --> 01:20:38,240
It's been a while since I came,
and I had a lot of fun.

2247
01:20:38,460 --> 01:20:39,500
Please invite me more often.

2248
01:20:39,570 --> 01:20:40,700
Okay.

2249
01:20:41,370 --> 01:20:42,830
Okay, Kang Han Na.

2250
01:20:43,150 --> 01:20:46,040
I'm sad because I couldn't dance
two more times.

2251
01:20:46,040 --> 01:20:47,480
- But thanks for letting me dance.
- Dance before we end.

2252
01:20:47,480 --> 01:20:48,910
- Go for it.
- Can I do that?

2253
01:20:48,910 --> 01:20:50,410
- If you want to, go ahead.
- Do it.

2254
01:20:50,410 --> 01:20:52,580
- It's your last chance.
- <i>I hope you trust me</i>

2255
01:20:52,620 --> 01:20:53,880
This was it.

2256
01:20:53,990 --> 01:20:55,990
- This is her superpower.
- Her moves are loose.

2257
01:20:55,990 --> 01:20:57,880
Does it make sense that one would
go blind from watching this?

2258
01:20:57,880 --> 01:20:59,920
- Her moves are loose.
- Of course, you'd go blind.

2259
01:20:59,920 --> 01:21:01,120
Her moves are loose.

2260
01:21:01,120 --> 01:21:03,700
Congratulations on
your 10th anniversary, Running Man.

2261
01:21:04,400 --> 01:21:06,400
(We thank Lee Sang Yeob
and Kang Han Na for joining us...)

2262
01:21:06,400 --> 01:21:07,830
(on our 10th anniversary.)

2263
01:21:08,630 --> 01:21:11,200
(The return of
the 2020 Reincarnation Race)

2264
01:21:11,200 --> 01:21:12,240
(Welcome to
the 1st Reincarnation Camp.)

2265
01:21:12,240 --> 01:21:13,330
(Part 2 of the race that viewers
wanted to see,)

2266
01:21:13,330 --> 01:21:14,370
(the Reincarnation Episode)

2267
01:21:14,370 --> 01:21:16,370
(ZICO, Lee Do Hyun,
SUNMI, Cho Sae Ho)

2268
01:21:17,410 --> 01:21:20,650
(The members are reincarnated
at different time periods.)

2269
01:21:21,350 --> 01:21:23,540
(While they enjoy
camping at peace,)

2270
01:21:23,540 --> 01:21:26,280
(a mystery siren goes off.)

2271
01:21:26,950 --> 01:21:28,190
(There's a secret...)

2272
01:21:28,190 --> 01:21:29,880
(behind the reincarnation camp?)

2273
01:21:30,750 --> 01:21:34,790
(Doubt and fear keep growing up
with mysterious accidents.)

2274
01:21:34,790 --> 01:21:36,030
You better be careful.

2275
01:21:36,360 --> 01:21:38,660
(The number of survivors
keeps decreasing.)

2276
01:21:38,960 --> 01:21:39,990
(They've got a limited time.)

2277
01:21:39,990 --> 01:21:43,530
(They have to find out
the secret of reincarnation.)

2278
01:21:44,310 --> 01:21:45,530
(The reincarnation special is back.)

2279
01:21:45,530 --> 01:21:47,070
(How would it end?)

2280
01:21:47,780 --> 01:21:49,980
