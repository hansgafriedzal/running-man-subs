1
00:00:05,410 --> 00:00:06,450
(One sunny day,
in a building in Seoul)

2
00:00:06,450 --> 00:00:08,210
- Hello.
- Hello.

3
00:00:09,170 --> 00:00:11,140
- Hello.
- Hello.

4
00:00:11,620 --> 00:00:14,180
- Hello.
- Do you want to be rich?

5
00:00:14,180 --> 00:00:15,420
Yes, I do.

6
00:00:15,420 --> 00:00:16,990
(There's a round table
with 8 seats.)

7
00:00:17,090 --> 00:00:18,490
I love the theme.

8
00:00:18,490 --> 00:00:20,520
Asura balbalta.

9
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:22,100
(Gambling Rules)

10
00:00:22,100 --> 00:00:23,550
Double or nothing.

11
00:00:23,550 --> 00:00:24,920
- Be quiet.
- Hello.

12
00:00:24,920 --> 00:00:26,960
- What's today's theme?
- Why is it so dark?

13
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:29,300
- We're going in there?
- You're going to be like that?

14
00:00:29,300 --> 00:00:30,340
- This...
- Okay.

15
00:00:30,690 --> 00:00:31,760
(Amazed)

16
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:32,910
Is this how we're going to start?

17
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:34,300
It's been a while.

18
00:00:34,300 --> 00:00:36,670
- A round table.
- "Gambling Rules".

19
00:00:37,270 --> 00:00:39,910
- So we're going to play a game?
- Hey, look at this.

20
00:00:39,910 --> 00:00:42,740
"No violence
under any circumstances."

21
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:45,050
- Asura balbalta.
- How can you gamble...

22
00:00:45,050 --> 00:00:46,550
- without any violence?
- What is this?

23
00:00:46,550 --> 00:00:47,650
What is this?

24
00:00:47,650 --> 00:00:50,220
"All alliances and strategies
allowed".

25
00:00:50,550 --> 00:00:53,050
I have a feeling
something huge is going to happen.

26
00:00:53,050 --> 00:00:54,380
(Card sharks from all over
the country are gathered.)

27
00:00:54,620 --> 00:00:57,190
- Double or nothing!
- What is this?

28
00:00:57,190 --> 00:00:58,990
Asura balbalta.

29
00:00:59,190 --> 00:01:01,470
- What's he saying?
- Hey, that's...

30
00:01:01,470 --> 00:01:02,940
Do you want to be rich?

31
00:01:02,940 --> 00:01:04,690
Are you singer Kim Jeong Soo?

32
00:01:05,010 --> 00:01:07,540
- I'm Corporal Pyeong.
- In my...

33
00:01:08,340 --> 00:01:09,340
(In my arms)

34
00:01:11,480 --> 00:01:12,600
Ji Hyo.

35
00:01:13,010 --> 00:01:15,320
- Do you know what today's theme is?
- Exactly.

36
00:01:15,320 --> 00:01:16,980
That's Lee Young Ae.

37
00:01:16,980 --> 00:01:18,440
- That's "Lady Vengeance".
- No.

38
00:01:18,440 --> 00:01:20,850
I'm Madam Song
who went to Ewha Womans University.

39
00:01:20,850 --> 00:01:22,820
Does Madam Song dress that way?

40
00:01:22,820 --> 00:01:24,820
- She doesn't.
- She doesn't.

41
00:01:24,820 --> 00:01:27,150
- Mind your own business.
- Is Madam Song Kim Hye Soo?

42
00:01:27,150 --> 00:01:28,180
Yes.

43
00:01:28,180 --> 00:01:30,130
Who are you trying to be?

44
00:01:30,130 --> 00:01:31,900
I'm T.O.P.

45
00:01:31,900 --> 00:01:33,520
That's just a shirt he has.

46
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:34,690
- Hey.
- It's his shirt.

47
00:01:34,690 --> 00:01:36,690
- This is a Hawaiian shirt.
- It's his shirt.

48
00:01:36,690 --> 00:01:39,070
Aren't you just wearing something
you recently bought?

49
00:01:39,070 --> 00:01:40,630
It's a Hawaiian shirt.

50
00:01:40,630 --> 00:01:41,800
- From "Tazza: The Hidden Card".
- It's not a Hawaiian shirt.

51
00:01:41,800 --> 00:01:43,340
- It's just a shirt for the opening.
- What?

52
00:01:43,340 --> 00:01:44,770
No, it isn't.

53
00:01:44,770 --> 00:01:46,100
You look like a realtor...

54
00:01:46,100 --> 00:01:47,710
in my neighborhood from head to toe.

55
00:01:47,710 --> 00:01:50,070
Hey, look at this.
I don't usually wear this.

56
00:01:50,070 --> 00:01:52,990
In that shirt, Jong Kook looks like
Trainer Yang.

57
00:01:52,990 --> 00:01:54,740
Isn't he dressed like a real thug?

58
00:01:55,550 --> 00:01:56,990
- Yes.
- That's right.

59
00:01:56,990 --> 00:01:58,520
A thug, a delinquent,

60
00:01:58,520 --> 00:02:00,150
- Kka Chi.
- and a stooge.

61
00:02:00,150 --> 00:02:01,690
A stooge?

62
00:02:02,100 --> 00:02:04,020
He definitely looks like a stooge.

63
00:02:04,230 --> 00:02:06,270
- Are you just an old student?
- I'm...

64
00:02:06,270 --> 00:02:07,730
- Someone who is studying...
- Hey, why are you...

65
00:02:07,730 --> 00:02:08,990
- Are you yourself?
- I'm myself.

66
00:02:08,990 --> 00:02:10,270
Try to get into character.

67
00:02:10,270 --> 00:02:11,460
I'm myself.

68
00:02:11,460 --> 00:02:13,500
- You're yourself.
- He looks kind whatever he wears.

69
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:14,740
- Right.
- Why does he look so kind?

70
00:02:14,740 --> 00:02:15,970
- Right?
- I'm myself.

71
00:02:15,970 --> 00:02:17,840
- Your outfit is the most proper.
- Yes.

72
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:19,050
- I'm dressed like Corporal Pyeong.
- Right.

73
00:02:19,050 --> 00:02:20,210
- It suits you.
- I heard the theme is "Tazza".

74
00:02:20,210 --> 00:02:22,970
By the way, you got dissed
on "Comedy Big League".

75
00:02:22,970 --> 00:02:25,310
That you can't paint the big picture
on "Running Man".

76
00:02:27,490 --> 00:02:29,860
(On "Comedy Big League" recently)

77
00:02:30,310 --> 00:02:33,330
(But you can't seem to paint
the big picture alone...)

78
00:02:33,330 --> 00:02:35,900
(on Running Man either.)

79
00:02:35,900 --> 00:02:37,220
(Embarrassed)

80
00:02:37,720 --> 00:02:39,800
(Hey, do you think
weekend variety shows are easy?)

81
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:42,740
They said I can't paint the big
picture alone on Running Man.

82
00:02:42,740 --> 00:02:44,800
- That was so accurate.
- I know.

83
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:45,800
- Right.
- I should get back at him.

84
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:47,740
Ji Hyo's movie, "Intruder"...

85
00:02:47,740 --> 00:02:49,430
- I can't watch it. It's too scary.
- Is it fun?

86
00:02:49,430 --> 00:02:52,110
- Ji Hyo did an amazing job.
- She did?

87
00:02:52,110 --> 00:02:55,180
But this wasn't the best time
for a movie release.

88
00:02:55,180 --> 00:02:56,620
- I know.
- Exactly.

89
00:02:56,620 --> 00:02:58,240
- Still,
- All her movies were successful.

90
00:02:58,240 --> 00:03:00,450
it attracted more than
a million viewers, right?

91
00:03:00,810 --> 00:03:01,990
It didn't.

92
00:03:01,990 --> 00:03:03,920
Suk Jin, don't bring that up.

93
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:05,590
- It was number one.
- In times like this...

94
00:03:05,590 --> 00:03:07,120
- Hey.
- What's with you?

95
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:08,800
It will soon.

96
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:10,960
- It's over. It's not in theaters.
- It's over.

97
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:12,460
- It's on IPTV now.
- It's over.

98
00:03:12,460 --> 00:03:14,430
- It's on IPTV?
- Yes.

99
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:16,990
Are you having a good day
or a bad day?

100
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:18,640
It's either very good or very bad.
What is it?

101
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:20,030
- You're the worst.
- It's very bad.

102
00:03:20,030 --> 00:03:21,500
I'm just having fun.

103
00:03:21,500 --> 00:03:23,110
Ji Hyo, I paid 11 dollars
for the movie.

104
00:03:23,110 --> 00:03:24,370
Thank you.

105
00:03:24,370 --> 00:03:25,950
- My wife did too.
- Really?

106
00:03:25,950 --> 00:03:27,300
- Thank you.
- I didn't watch it though.

107
00:03:27,300 --> 00:03:28,520
I feel comforted.

108
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:30,310
- I was upset about...
- I'll wait until it's five dollars.

109
00:03:30,310 --> 00:03:31,550
- Jong Kook.
- Hey.

110
00:03:31,550 --> 00:03:33,710
- Spend some more.
- That's so you.

111
00:03:33,710 --> 00:03:34,920
You're unbelievable.

112
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:36,810
- Jong Kook.
- He'll wait for a lower price.

113
00:03:36,810 --> 00:03:37,960
Can't you spend that much
for your colleague?

114
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:39,750
I rarely watch movies
that cost more than 10 dollars.

115
00:03:39,750 --> 00:03:41,360
Just pay 11 dollars.

116
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:42,830
- You're sweating so much.
- What?

117
00:03:42,830 --> 00:03:44,430
- Are you okay? You're sweaty.
- It's not sweat.

118
00:03:44,430 --> 00:03:46,770
- He just has greasy skin.
- It's sunscreen.

119
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:49,200
- He has greasy skin.
- It's sunscreen.

120
00:03:49,930 --> 00:03:51,460
I don't wear any makeup
other than sunscreen.

121
00:03:51,460 --> 00:03:54,210
Still, your skin looks so healthy.

122
00:03:54,210 --> 00:03:56,210
- Okay.
- He's going at it again.

123
00:03:57,740 --> 00:03:59,450
(Suk Jin is going at it again.)

124
00:03:59,450 --> 00:04:02,340
- Please show us this once.
- He never misses an opportunity.

125
00:04:02,340 --> 00:04:03,840
Please start a conversation
successfully for once.

126
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:05,210
- Show us what you can do.
- I can't do anything more.

127
00:04:05,210 --> 00:04:07,210
I gave it a try,
but there's no chance.

128
00:04:07,210 --> 00:04:08,310
- It got cut off?
- Yes.

129
00:04:08,310 --> 00:04:10,210
He picked a fight
by saying I have greasy skin.

130
00:04:10,210 --> 00:04:11,490
I did.

131
00:04:11,490 --> 00:04:13,780
- But it didn't offend him at all.
- Please start a conversation.

132
00:04:13,780 --> 00:04:15,830
He couldn't be bothered.

133
00:04:15,830 --> 00:04:17,050
I picked a fight
by saying he has greasy skin,

134
00:04:17,050 --> 00:04:18,770
but it didn't offend him,
so it ended there.

135
00:04:18,770 --> 00:04:21,460
- Of course.
- Look how Jong Kook is sitting.

136
00:04:21,460 --> 00:04:24,090
It means he'll let most things pass.

137
00:04:24,090 --> 00:04:26,530
- But if he goes, "Oh, really?"
- Exactly.

138
00:04:26,530 --> 00:04:28,100
- Right.
- That's right.

139
00:04:28,100 --> 00:04:30,210
- That means he's more engaged.
- That's right.

140
00:04:30,210 --> 00:04:31,470
- "Oh, really?"
- Exactly.

141
00:04:31,470 --> 00:04:32,840
(He always says, "Oh, really?")

142
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:34,080
"Oh, really?"

143
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:35,250
(It means he's ready to talk.)

144
00:04:35,250 --> 00:04:37,450
- That's right.
- Exactly.

145
00:04:37,450 --> 00:04:39,110
- That's how I should look.
- Of course.

146
00:04:39,110 --> 00:04:40,210
- That's right.
- That's right.

147
00:04:40,210 --> 00:04:43,060
If I'm sitting like this,
it means I'll let everything pass.

148
00:04:43,060 --> 00:04:45,520
- I can see there's space.
- Yes.

149
00:04:45,780 --> 00:04:46,830
(After 10 years, he finally gets
Jong Kook's signals.)

150
00:04:46,830 --> 00:04:48,130
- Everyone.
- Yes.

151
00:04:48,280 --> 00:04:51,420
You're variety show sharks
from all over the country.

152
00:04:51,420 --> 00:04:52,720
(Variety show sharks from all over
the country are gathered.)

153
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:53,770
Variety show sharks.

154
00:04:53,770 --> 00:04:54,960
You'll compete in...

155
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:56,360
War of Sharks.

156
00:04:56,360 --> 00:04:58,230
- War of Sharks.
- We're variety show sharks.

157
00:04:58,230 --> 00:05:00,940
Your currency today is caramels.

158
00:05:00,940 --> 00:05:02,210
- Caramels?
- Yes.

159
00:05:02,440 --> 00:05:04,030
- Caramels.
- The number of caramels...

160
00:05:04,030 --> 00:05:05,710
you have at the end...

161
00:05:05,710 --> 00:05:07,170
will have a huge impact
on tomorrow's shoot.

162
00:05:07,170 --> 00:05:08,250
- Tomorrow's shoot?
- Tomorrow's shoot?

163
00:05:08,250 --> 00:05:10,450
It affects next week's episode?

164
00:05:10,750 --> 00:05:12,110
Gosh.

165
00:05:12,540 --> 00:05:15,460
First, you'll be given
10 caramels each.

166
00:05:15,850 --> 00:05:18,410
- Can I eat them?
- Then you lose them.

167
00:05:18,410 --> 00:05:21,760
They're distributed
by a real dealer.

168
00:05:22,420 --> 00:05:23,760
These are tasty.

169
00:05:23,760 --> 00:05:25,420
- I know.
- They're made in the US.

170
00:05:25,420 --> 00:05:26,860
- I want to eat them.
- Me too.

171
00:05:26,860 --> 00:05:28,590
- Thank you.
- I want to eat just one.

172
00:05:28,590 --> 00:05:29,590
I'll save them.

173
00:05:29,590 --> 00:05:32,140
- They're your money today.
- Okay.

174
00:05:32,310 --> 00:05:34,400
Before we start the mission,

175
00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:36,900
you'll elect a chairman.

176
00:05:36,900 --> 00:05:38,100
- A chairman?
- A chairman?

177
00:05:38,470 --> 00:05:41,100
- A chairman.
- A chairman has the right...

178
00:05:41,100 --> 00:05:43,210
to decide the mission order
and teams.

179
00:05:43,210 --> 00:05:44,250
- That's huge.
- Really?

180
00:05:44,250 --> 00:05:47,110
There will be a total
of two elections today.

181
00:05:47,890 --> 00:05:51,060
Anyone can run for election,

182
00:05:51,260 --> 00:05:53,460
and all candidates are given
30 bills...

183
00:05:53,460 --> 00:05:55,220
for their campaign funds.

184
00:05:55,220 --> 00:05:56,420
They're given what?

185
00:05:56,420 --> 00:05:57,720
- Bills.
- 30 bills?

186
00:05:58,220 --> 00:06:00,020
The candidates can then
issue their bills...

187
00:06:00,020 --> 00:06:01,420
to win votes.

188
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:04,900
Each voter is given three ballots.

189
00:06:04,900 --> 00:06:06,530
- Three ballots?
- Really?

190
00:06:06,530 --> 00:06:08,100
That's a lot.

191
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:09,640
Voters are allowed...

192
00:06:09,640 --> 00:06:12,470
to receive bills from any candidate.

193
00:06:12,470 --> 00:06:14,770
But only the bills
from the winner...

194
00:06:14,770 --> 00:06:16,820
will be exchanged for caramels.

195
00:06:17,880 --> 00:06:21,020
If the candidate
that I support loses,

196
00:06:21,020 --> 00:06:22,460
- Things get complicated.
- I get no caramels, right?

197
00:06:22,460 --> 00:06:23,480
That's right.

198
00:06:23,690 --> 00:06:25,690
- Suk Jin...
- We should support them.

199
00:06:26,060 --> 00:06:27,520
The bills...

200
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:29,650
that the winner has left
will be exchanged...

201
00:06:29,650 --> 00:06:31,330
for caramels as well.

202
00:06:31,330 --> 00:06:33,070
So think before you hand out bills.

203
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:34,420
Gosh, that's...

204
00:06:34,420 --> 00:06:37,290
Each candidate is given 30 bills,

205
00:06:37,660 --> 00:06:39,940
which they can use
as their campaign funds.

206
00:06:40,310 --> 00:06:42,080
I want to be a voter.

207
00:06:42,310 --> 00:06:45,230
I'm not very interested in having...

208
00:06:45,230 --> 00:06:46,400
- a high position.
- Really?

209
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:47,400
If you support me...

210
00:06:47,970 --> 00:06:49,770
(Intrigued)

211
00:06:50,020 --> 00:06:51,580
If you support me, I want to try.

212
00:06:51,580 --> 00:06:53,090
Are you getting interested?

213
00:06:53,340 --> 00:06:55,410
Are you? I think you are.

214
00:06:55,410 --> 00:06:58,830
I bet Suk Jin wants to participate.

215
00:06:58,830 --> 00:07:01,190
- Right.
- My goodness.

216
00:07:01,190 --> 00:07:02,520
I'll support you.

217
00:07:02,520 --> 00:07:04,130
Are you going to run or not?

218
00:07:04,130 --> 00:07:06,020
- Me? I will.
- Yes.

219
00:07:06,020 --> 00:07:07,070
(Of course.)

220
00:07:07,070 --> 00:07:09,090
Just get out of this place.

221
00:07:09,090 --> 00:07:11,140
- What are you going to do?
- I want to run.

222
00:07:11,140 --> 00:07:12,710
How can you say that
without any support?

223
00:07:12,710 --> 00:07:14,070
I want to run.

224
00:07:14,440 --> 00:07:16,730
I'll give each of you
a caramel now.

225
00:07:16,730 --> 00:07:17,880
- Right now?
- Yes.

226
00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:19,770
- Your caramels?
- If you promise you'll support me.

227
00:07:19,770 --> 00:07:21,040
- Promise me.
- I'll support you.

228
00:07:21,380 --> 00:07:22,540
- I'll support you.
- I'll support you too.

229
00:07:22,540 --> 00:07:23,770
- Who's going to support me?
- Me.

230
00:07:23,770 --> 00:07:24,840
- I'll support you.
- I'll support you too.

231
00:07:24,840 --> 00:07:25,910
- Who's going to support me?
- Me.

232
00:07:25,910 --> 00:07:27,280
(Everyone promises him support.)

233
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:29,260
I give up.

234
00:07:29,260 --> 00:07:30,980
- Why?
- I give up.

235
00:07:30,980 --> 00:07:33,130
- You all look so mischievous.
- What is this?

236
00:07:33,130 --> 00:07:34,460
- No.
- You look so mischievous.

237
00:07:34,460 --> 00:07:36,060
- What is this?
- You're going to play me.

238
00:07:36,060 --> 00:07:37,400
- No.
- The look in your eyes...

239
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:38,590
How can you trample on
our genuine support?

240
00:07:39,270 --> 00:07:41,460
You guys all look so mischievous.

241
00:07:41,770 --> 00:07:42,960
I give up.

242
00:07:44,090 --> 00:07:45,290
I want to run for election.

243
00:07:45,290 --> 00:07:46,900
- Suk Jin wants to run.
- Yes.

244
00:07:46,900 --> 00:07:48,460
- Suk Jin.
- I'll run.

245
00:07:48,460 --> 00:07:50,230
The two of us...

246
00:07:50,230 --> 00:07:51,340
I'll run too.

247
00:07:52,340 --> 00:07:55,750
My opponents look pretty easy,

248
00:07:55,750 --> 00:07:56,820
- so I want to run too.
- Hey!

249
00:07:56,820 --> 00:07:58,780
- Are you sure?
- I'll be fair.

250
00:07:58,780 --> 00:08:00,110
- I promise.
- Okay, good.

251
00:08:00,110 --> 00:08:01,390
- It's the 3 of us.
- It's the 3 of us.

252
00:08:01,390 --> 00:08:02,710
- That's it.
- Okay.

253
00:08:02,710 --> 00:08:04,110
Bills, please.

254
00:08:04,110 --> 00:08:05,460
No more candidates?

255
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:09,460
All right. If you support me,

256
00:08:10,060 --> 00:08:11,400
- Hey.
- I'll give you five bills.

257
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:12,900
- Right now...
- Really?

258
00:08:12,900 --> 00:08:15,160
- Excluding the other candidates.
- Okay.

259
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:17,000
- Five is enough.
- I promise...

260
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,900
I'll divide my bills
among my supporters equally...

261
00:08:18,900 --> 00:08:21,530
and give everyone one more each.

262
00:08:22,010 --> 00:08:23,010
- Really?
- Yes.

263
00:08:23,010 --> 00:08:25,010
- Why? Then what will you have?
- There are 30, right?

264
00:08:25,010 --> 00:08:26,100
(The generous promise
sways the voters.)

265
00:08:26,270 --> 00:08:28,310
If I promise I'll divide
my bills equally,

266
00:08:28,310 --> 00:08:29,670
- who wants to support me?
- Cut it out.

267
00:08:29,670 --> 00:08:31,040
- Just sit down.
- No way.

268
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:32,390
- Forget it.
- Don't be ridiculous.

269
00:08:32,390 --> 00:08:34,110
I won't support you
even if you give me all your bills.

270
00:08:34,110 --> 00:08:35,760
No. Convince me...

271
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:37,380
- that you'll divide them equally.
- Even if you give me everything.

272
00:08:37,380 --> 00:08:39,790
- I have to give you first anyway...
- How...

273
00:08:39,790 --> 00:08:41,120
- Okay.
- We take a vote afterward.

274
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:43,060
- Yes?
- Ji Hyo, if you're not running,

275
00:08:43,060 --> 00:08:44,350
please support me.

276
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:46,330
I'll divide my bills equally.

277
00:08:46,330 --> 00:08:48,590
Then give me a down payment.

278
00:08:49,630 --> 00:08:51,840
- That's smart.
- She sure is a shark.

279
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:52,860
That's how you should play.

280
00:08:52,860 --> 00:08:54,040
Ji Hyo will keep her word.

281
00:08:54,040 --> 00:08:56,280
- I always keep my word.
- But...

282
00:08:56,280 --> 00:08:57,500
I'll write your name.

283
00:08:57,500 --> 00:08:59,000
- 30 bills?
- Yes.

284
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,140
This is only the beginning.
I wouldn't be...

285
00:09:01,140 --> 00:09:03,320
- so reckless.
- Kwang Soo, if I support you...

286
00:09:03,820 --> 00:09:06,210
Give me a caramel,
and I'll give you three votes.

287
00:09:06,710 --> 00:09:08,290
- What do you say?
- I...

288
00:09:08,290 --> 00:09:09,290
Two...

289
00:09:09,290 --> 00:09:11,510
- I'll vote straightforwardly.
- Are you serious?

290
00:09:11,820 --> 00:09:13,530
You're really giving me this?

291
00:09:13,930 --> 00:09:15,380
- Gosh, then I'll vote for you.
- What is this?

292
00:09:15,380 --> 00:09:16,560
I have to.

293
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:17,890
- He gave this to you?
- Yes.

294
00:09:17,890 --> 00:09:19,090
- Really?
- I'll vote for you.

295
00:09:19,090 --> 00:09:20,390
Kwang Soo, look at this.

296
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:22,960
I wrote, "Lee Kwang Soo". This is...

297
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:24,490
Put a caramel in this box,

298
00:09:24,490 --> 00:09:26,100
and I'll vote for you.

299
00:09:27,460 --> 00:09:28,940
Put a caramel in here,

300
00:09:28,940 --> 00:09:31,100
and I'll vote for you right away.

301
00:09:31,100 --> 00:09:32,140
- Okay.
- Hold on.

302
00:09:32,140 --> 00:09:33,810
- Lee Kwang Soo.
- Lee Kwang Soo.

303
00:09:33,810 --> 00:09:35,370
- Hold on.
- Lee Kwang Soo.

304
00:09:35,710 --> 00:09:37,680
- Lee Kwang Soo.
- I have no choice.

305
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:39,690
- Kwang Soo.
- I'm not that reckless.

306
00:09:39,880 --> 00:09:41,320
- Let me tell you...
- Give me.

307
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:42,560
- I'll give you three bills each.
- What?

308
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:43,710
- Really?
- Three bills each.

309
00:09:43,710 --> 00:09:45,830
- I'll give you three each.
- Kwang Soo.

310
00:09:45,830 --> 00:09:48,560
- He's going all-in for us.
- I'm serious.

311
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:50,350
- He's going all-in.
- I'll give you three each.

312
00:09:52,030 --> 00:09:54,120
- I count on the three of you.
- This is...

313
00:09:54,570 --> 00:09:55,860
How many?

314
00:09:55,860 --> 00:09:57,760
- I'll give you 3.
- 3?

315
00:09:57,760 --> 00:10:00,340
- I'll give you 4 each.
- 4 each.

316
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:02,340
- I'll give you four each.
- Give us right away.

317
00:10:02,340 --> 00:10:03,870
- Four.
- They're giving away so much.

318
00:10:04,100 --> 00:10:06,180
- They're giving away all they have.
- So Min, you get four too.

319
00:10:06,180 --> 00:10:07,710
- Okay, thank you.
- All right.

320
00:10:07,710 --> 00:10:09,840
- Then I'll change my vote.
- Give me something.

321
00:10:10,010 --> 00:10:11,340
Can you change your vote?

322
00:10:11,340 --> 00:10:12,550
- Give me something, and I'll...
- What can I do?

323
00:10:12,550 --> 00:10:13,640
- vote for you right away.
- I'll give you four, Jong Kook.

324
00:10:13,640 --> 00:10:14,710
- I mean...
- I'll vote for you right away.

325
00:10:14,710 --> 00:10:16,320
(The voters keep changing
their minds.)

326
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:17,350
(Jae Suk gives Jong Kook 4 bills.)

327
00:10:17,350 --> 00:10:18,590
- You should give me right away.
- Okay.

328
00:10:18,590 --> 00:10:19,880
- Nice.
- How many are they?

329
00:10:19,880 --> 00:10:22,030
- Four? All right. Here.
- Okay.

330
00:10:22,030 --> 00:10:23,160
I'll give you five.

331
00:10:23,160 --> 00:10:24,430
I can't believe this.

332
00:10:24,430 --> 00:10:26,490
- I give you five.
- You're broad-minded.

333
00:10:26,570 --> 00:10:29,940
I will keep my eye
only on the three smart voters.

334
00:10:30,540 --> 00:10:32,310
Here. Five.

335
00:10:32,310 --> 00:10:33,540
Let me check them.

336
00:10:33,540 --> 00:10:36,600
Suk Jin, you can't treat
Se Chan and me as equals.

337
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:37,870
"As equals"?

338
00:10:38,310 --> 00:10:39,600
- Excuse me.
- What do you think you're doing?

339
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:42,280
- I have no money.
- I'm the VVIP.

340
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:45,280
- I still have two ballots.
- You're being stingy.

341
00:10:45,280 --> 00:10:47,010
You can't treat me like him.

342
00:10:47,010 --> 00:10:48,050
- Here.
- Okay.

343
00:10:48,050 --> 00:10:49,160
I almost went into a sulk.

344
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:51,660
Suk Jin. Suk Jin?

345
00:10:51,660 --> 00:10:53,330
- Here. They are seven.
- Well done.

346
00:10:53,330 --> 00:10:55,720
- Okay.
- Did you get seven bills already?

347
00:10:55,720 --> 00:10:57,390
Gosh, I might go bankrupt.

348
00:10:57,390 --> 00:10:58,930
It's done. Good.

349
00:10:58,930 --> 00:11:00,760
- Done.
- I've made up my mind.

350
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:03,070
Guys, I will keep my promise.

351
00:11:03,070 --> 00:11:06,070
I will keep my eye
only on the three smart voters.

352
00:11:06,070 --> 00:11:07,500
I'm done. I'll put them
in the box right away.

353
00:11:07,910 --> 00:11:10,180
You will get the caramels
only when I win the election.

354
00:11:10,180 --> 00:11:11,410
Sure. I know.

355
00:11:11,410 --> 00:11:14,180
Hey, you're good at this.

356
00:11:14,180 --> 00:11:17,140
Please remember that I'm the only
one who offered real caramels.

357
00:11:17,140 --> 00:11:18,340
- Yes, you did.
- I get it.

358
00:11:18,340 --> 00:11:20,920
It will eventually
affect the result.

359
00:11:20,920 --> 00:11:23,250
- You'll see.
- I will keep my promise.

360
00:11:23,250 --> 00:11:25,350
- I will do the same.
- You should watch the situation.

361
00:11:25,350 --> 00:11:28,060
These two don't even know
about the concept of bills.

362
00:11:28,060 --> 00:11:29,830
The way I see it,

363
00:11:29,830 --> 00:11:32,700
you should just wipe your buttocks
with them. They're useless.

364
00:11:32,700 --> 00:11:34,590
- They are bills of dishonor.
- Look at him.

365
00:11:34,620 --> 00:11:37,200
You can't paint a big picture.

366
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:38,860
- What are you talking about?
- You're so...

367
00:11:38,860 --> 00:11:40,170
They are useless.

368
00:11:40,170 --> 00:11:42,070
- Wipe my buttocks?
- Go wipe your buttocks.

369
00:11:42,070 --> 00:11:44,340
I have a bidet in my place.

370
00:11:44,340 --> 00:11:46,450
- Do you have a bidet?
- How dare you...

371
00:11:46,450 --> 00:11:49,010
- For the ballot-counting...
- Let's make this fair.

372
00:11:49,010 --> 00:11:50,510
Ji Hyo will count the ballots.

373
00:11:50,510 --> 00:11:52,590
I have to become the chairman.

374
00:11:52,590 --> 00:11:53,820
All right.

375
00:11:53,820 --> 00:11:55,960
Okay. One vote for Yoo Jae Suk.

376
00:11:55,960 --> 00:11:57,350
All right. Thank you.

377
00:11:57,480 --> 00:11:59,090
- One vote for Lee Kwang Soo.
- Okay.

378
00:11:59,560 --> 00:12:01,190
- Who voted for Kwang Soo?
- Can you believe it?

379
00:12:01,190 --> 00:12:02,620
Did you not vote for me?

380
00:12:02,620 --> 00:12:03,620
What was that?

381
00:12:04,490 --> 00:12:05,700
- Ji Suk Jin.
- Okay.

382
00:12:05,700 --> 00:12:07,030
- There should be three votes.
- My gosh.

383
00:12:07,030 --> 00:12:08,590
- Ji Suk Jin.
- Oh, dear.

384
00:12:08,590 --> 00:12:10,890
(Ji Suk Jin got two votes.)

385
00:12:10,890 --> 00:12:12,360
- Ji Suk Jin.
- Okay!

386
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:14,000
Ji Suk Jin!

387
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,730
- Ji Suk Jin.
- I won't forget it.

388
00:12:15,730 --> 00:12:16,730
"I won't forget it."

389
00:12:16,730 --> 00:12:17,970
- Ji Suk Jin.
- My comrades.

390
00:12:17,970 --> 00:12:19,210
I won't forget this.

391
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:21,000
- Ji Suk Jin.
- Ji Suk Jin!

392
00:12:21,450 --> 00:12:24,870
- Ji Suk Jin!
- Ji Suk Jin!

393
00:12:24,970 --> 00:12:27,050
- My time has come.
- My goodness.

394
00:12:27,050 --> 00:12:28,820
- I won't forget this.
- Ji Suk Jin.

395
00:12:28,820 --> 00:12:30,750
- My comrades.
- Ji Suk Jin!

396
00:12:31,010 --> 00:12:32,980
- Come here.
- Ji Suk Jin.

397
00:12:33,090 --> 00:12:34,750
- Ji Suk Jin.
- Ji Suk Jin.

398
00:12:35,850 --> 00:12:37,200
Okay. This is good.

399
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:39,490
- I hope I get a good seat.
- All right.

400
00:12:39,490 --> 00:12:41,070
- Jae Suk got three votes.
- Here's the deal.

401
00:12:41,070 --> 00:12:42,840
Ji Hyo got me three votes.

402
00:12:42,840 --> 00:12:44,990
And So Min got Kwang Soo
three votes.

403
00:12:44,990 --> 00:12:46,460
(Suk Jin is elected with 9 votes.)

404
00:12:46,460 --> 00:12:50,470
Hang on. Why did you not vote
for me after getting my caramels?

405
00:12:50,710 --> 00:12:52,470
- There must be some reason.
- Or So Min...

406
00:12:52,470 --> 00:12:53,910
It will eventually pay off.

407
00:12:53,910 --> 00:12:55,450
- So Min is nice.
- You'll see.

408
00:12:55,450 --> 00:12:57,640
Suk Jin, you are
an investment genius.

409
00:12:57,640 --> 00:12:58,640
Okay.

410
00:12:58,870 --> 00:13:01,740
I have fewer caramels
than my voters, but I'm satisfied.

411
00:13:01,740 --> 00:13:03,590
This is real money.

412
00:13:03,590 --> 00:13:06,350
The first chairman is Ji Suk Jin.

413
00:13:06,350 --> 00:13:08,460
- Hello.
- Ji Suk Jin!

414
00:13:08,590 --> 00:13:10,530
- Ji Suk Jin!
- I will never forget this.

415
00:13:10,530 --> 00:13:12,570
- Ji Suk Jin.
- Let me put this on you.

416
00:13:13,170 --> 00:13:15,530
He's putting on the armband.

417
00:13:17,460 --> 00:13:18,630
It stings!

418
00:13:18,840 --> 00:13:20,260
I can't believe this.

419
00:13:20,540 --> 00:13:22,340
(He pricks Suk Jin's arm
with a pin.)

420
00:13:22,340 --> 00:13:24,840
I can't believe this. Hey!

421
00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:27,580
- He tried to pin it into your skin.
- You should pin it into your skin.

422
00:13:27,580 --> 00:13:32,140
I saw how Jae Suk
tried to make the pin sharp.

423
00:13:32,140 --> 00:13:34,740
I won't let it happen again
in the next election.

424
00:13:34,740 --> 00:13:35,790
There will be another election.

425
00:13:35,790 --> 00:13:37,750
This episode
will continue next week too.

426
00:13:37,750 --> 00:13:39,160
- This is disappointing.
- It went well at the last moment.

427
00:13:39,330 --> 00:13:40,930
- I told you.
- We were quite determined.

428
00:13:40,930 --> 00:13:43,850
I only need three smart voters.

429
00:13:45,060 --> 00:13:46,670
- Chairman Jee.
- Yes?

430
00:13:46,670 --> 00:13:48,830
We're living well off thanks to you.

431
00:13:48,960 --> 00:13:52,040
Don't worry about
getting good seats.

432
00:13:52,040 --> 00:13:53,210
Okay.

433
00:13:53,210 --> 00:13:54,940
Let's begin then.

434
00:13:55,100 --> 00:13:56,710
- Hang on.
- Why are you eating it?

435
00:13:56,710 --> 00:13:59,470
- Why is he eating it?
- What? Are you eating mine?

436
00:13:59,470 --> 00:14:01,600
2, 4, 6, 8, and 10.

437
00:14:01,710 --> 00:14:02,740
2 and 4...

438
00:14:02,740 --> 00:14:03,780
Hey!

439
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:08,550
(Stealing)

440
00:14:09,590 --> 00:14:11,060
(While Suk Jin was enjoying
the victory,)

441
00:14:11,060 --> 00:14:12,480
(Jae Suk stole his caramel.)

442
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:14,430
Come here. Hey!

443
00:14:14,830 --> 00:14:16,030
Bring it back, you jerk!

444
00:14:16,030 --> 00:14:18,430
How could you eat my money?

445
00:14:19,070 --> 00:14:20,890
This is my money.

446
00:14:20,890 --> 00:14:22,390
He's into his character.

447
00:14:22,390 --> 00:14:24,840
It seemed so natural that
I didn't even know what was wrong.

448
00:14:25,630 --> 00:14:26,810
Just accept it.

449
00:14:26,810 --> 00:14:28,710
You owe me one. Okay?

450
00:14:29,230 --> 00:14:30,600
Let's move to the first venue.

451
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:31,940
- Okay.
- It's downstairs.

452
00:14:32,370 --> 00:14:33,550
(Current Number of Caramels)

453
00:14:33,550 --> 00:14:35,340
You can expect to get good seats.

454
00:14:35,340 --> 00:14:36,710
- Okay, Chairman.
- Thank you.

455
00:14:37,340 --> 00:14:39,610
It sounds nice. I like
the world with no violence.

456
00:14:39,610 --> 00:14:42,320
It's not fun since
no violence is allowed today.

457
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:43,510
- What is this?
- What's that?

458
00:14:43,510 --> 00:14:45,750
- Where do we sit? Can we just sit?
- I think...

459
00:14:45,980 --> 00:14:47,830
- we should sit with the team.
- We should sit together, Jong Kook.

460
00:14:47,830 --> 00:14:49,030
Let's do that. Have a seat.

461
00:14:49,030 --> 00:14:51,390
You can sit with anyone
whom you want to work with.

462
00:14:51,390 --> 00:14:52,800
- All right.
- Have a seat.

463
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:54,670
- Haha, have a seat.
- Sir.

464
00:14:54,670 --> 00:14:55,840
(Coming quickly)

465
00:14:55,840 --> 00:14:57,570
Go back to your seats.

466
00:14:57,570 --> 00:14:58,570
(They all are coming
to sit next to Jong Kook.)

467
00:14:58,570 --> 00:15:00,630
Jong Kook, let's move
to the seats over there.

468
00:15:02,540 --> 00:15:03,870
(He takes the best seat.)

469
00:15:03,870 --> 00:15:06,810
You can't do this. Go back
to your seat and fight alone.

470
00:15:07,100 --> 00:15:08,240
Sir.

471
00:15:09,140 --> 00:15:10,580
We left your seat empty.

472
00:15:10,580 --> 00:15:11,680
- Gentlemen.
- Come and have a seat.

473
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:13,090
- Have a seat here.
- Please sit.

474
00:15:13,090 --> 00:15:14,950
You guys are my family.

475
00:15:14,950 --> 00:15:18,610
- Ji Suk Jin.
- Ji Suk Jin.

476
00:15:18,610 --> 00:15:20,560
- I'll take good care of my family.
- Ji Suk Jin.

477
00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:22,430
- I won't forget about you.
- Ji Suk Jin.

478
00:15:22,430 --> 00:15:24,530
If you want to enter politics,

479
00:15:24,530 --> 00:15:26,170
you will need a powerful fist.

480
00:15:26,170 --> 00:15:29,070
- I know that. It means a lot to me.
- Good.

481
00:15:29,630 --> 00:15:31,170
You can expect a good seat.

482
00:15:31,540 --> 00:15:33,070
The beginning of the game
isn't so important.

483
00:15:33,070 --> 00:15:34,670
- Sure.
- Please support me next time.

484
00:15:34,670 --> 00:15:35,840
Good luck with the next election.

485
00:15:35,840 --> 00:15:37,230
There will be a next time.

486
00:15:37,230 --> 00:15:39,210
Please support me
in the next election.

487
00:15:39,910 --> 00:15:41,470
We're divided into two groups.

488
00:15:41,470 --> 00:15:43,710
We should be a team again
in the next round.

489
00:15:43,710 --> 00:15:45,880
We can't have another chairman.
You should run for election.

490
00:15:45,880 --> 00:15:48,010
- If you do...
- You should be the next chairman.

491
00:15:48,010 --> 00:15:50,960
They have more betrayers
in the team.

492
00:15:50,960 --> 00:15:52,010
Exactly.

493
00:15:52,010 --> 00:15:54,790
I just realized this
during the first election.

494
00:15:54,790 --> 00:15:56,850
I'm not good enough
to be the chairman.

495
00:15:58,160 --> 00:15:59,570
- Now you know it.
- I learned my lesson.

496
00:15:59,570 --> 00:16:00,620
That's not true.

497
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:03,260
The one who's not good enough
is the current chairman.

498
00:16:03,260 --> 00:16:04,360
You think?

499
00:16:04,360 --> 00:16:06,940
(He's got the title
that's too good for him.)

500
00:16:07,170 --> 00:16:08,340
He's become the chairman already.

501
00:16:08,340 --> 00:16:09,370
(Even his supporters can't deny it.)

502
00:16:09,370 --> 00:16:12,410
- Office changes manners.
- Sure.

503
00:16:13,050 --> 00:16:14,310
(He can't help feeling bitter.)

504
00:16:14,310 --> 00:16:18,180
Alliances and strategies are
important for the first mission.

505
00:16:18,180 --> 00:16:20,240
- It's Minority Rock-Paper-Scissors.
- Minority Rock-Paper-Scissors?

506
00:16:21,820 --> 00:16:25,010
The crew member will present a card
among rock, paper, or scissors.

507
00:16:25,010 --> 00:16:27,430
Then each of you will
choose one card...

508
00:16:27,430 --> 00:16:29,350
and open it all at the same time.

509
00:16:29,350 --> 00:16:32,590
And only those who picked
the card of the minority...

510
00:16:32,590 --> 00:16:35,200
will get caramels according to
the result of rock-paper-scissors.

511
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:37,490
If you beat the crew member,
you get five caramels.

512
00:16:37,490 --> 00:16:39,960
If it's a tie, you get 3 caramels.
If you lose, you get 1 caramel.

513
00:16:39,960 --> 00:16:43,370
But the majority will have to
return one caramel each.

514
00:16:43,370 --> 00:16:44,870
- I get it.
- Okay.

515
00:16:44,870 --> 00:16:47,280
We should win rock-paper-scissors
as the minority.

516
00:16:47,280 --> 00:16:49,580
- Exactly.
- Here's our first card.

517
00:16:49,580 --> 00:16:51,180
- Let's see.
- We're outcasts here.

518
00:16:51,180 --> 00:16:52,240
Your card is scissors.

519
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:54,090
Our first card is scissors.

520
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:55,980
The majority will show rock.

521
00:16:55,980 --> 00:16:58,090
- Suk Jin, let's do this.
- One of us should...

522
00:16:58,090 --> 00:16:59,980
Here's my idea.

523
00:16:59,980 --> 00:17:02,060
I think we should show these two.

524
00:17:02,060 --> 00:17:03,990
- Okay.
- That's our plan.

525
00:17:03,990 --> 00:17:05,350
- This is...
- We should blow this.

526
00:17:05,350 --> 00:17:06,390
We should show this.

527
00:17:06,960 --> 00:17:08,670
(Right at the moment...)

528
00:17:08,830 --> 00:17:10,430
- No.
- This one.

529
00:17:10,430 --> 00:17:11,570
We should show this.

530
00:17:11,660 --> 00:17:12,860
- No.
- This one.

531
00:17:12,860 --> 00:17:15,310
You're holding rock and scissors.

532
00:17:15,310 --> 00:17:17,240
- Oh, right. You can see my card.
- What are you doing?

533
00:17:17,240 --> 00:17:19,040
(The paper card is left
on his table.)

534
00:17:19,040 --> 00:17:20,480
- Did you see that?
- What was that?

535
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:22,780
- Did you see it?
- My gosh.

536
00:17:22,780 --> 00:17:25,140
- He's such a fool.
- When did you see it?

537
00:17:25,140 --> 00:17:26,180
When did you see it?

538
00:17:26,180 --> 00:17:27,990
My gosh, we ended up
in the same team.

539
00:17:27,990 --> 00:17:29,450
That's too bad.

540
00:17:29,450 --> 00:17:30,560
What do we do now?

541
00:17:30,560 --> 00:17:32,180
(Jae Suk Gang starts to talk
about their strategies.)

542
00:17:32,180 --> 00:17:33,490
We should support one person.

543
00:17:33,920 --> 00:17:36,150
We should stop them
from collecting more caramels.

544
00:17:36,500 --> 00:17:37,730
So you should support me.

545
00:17:37,850 --> 00:17:39,060
I have six caramels now.

546
00:17:39,060 --> 00:17:42,840
I think we should
play this randomly.

547
00:17:42,840 --> 00:17:44,590
- You think?
- If things go wrong,

548
00:17:44,740 --> 00:17:46,810
we might be hoist
with our own petard.

549
00:17:46,810 --> 00:17:48,240
Do you know what I mean?

550
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:49,600
Just show any card you want.

551
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:51,430
If we come up with a wrong plan...

552
00:17:51,430 --> 00:17:52,900
(Are we playing this randomly?)

553
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:54,700
Just show any card you want, okay?

554
00:17:54,700 --> 00:17:56,480
Excuse me. Is there
a seat available?

555
00:17:57,720 --> 00:18:00,320
(One member of Jae Suk Gang
leaves the team.)

556
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:02,340
Hang on. Aren't you a candidate?

557
00:18:02,340 --> 00:18:04,450
- No. It's 4 to 4 now.
- Excuse me.

558
00:18:04,450 --> 00:18:06,060
He was going to leave anyway.

559
00:18:06,060 --> 00:18:07,380
- You know it, right?
- All of a sudden?

560
00:18:07,450 --> 00:18:09,120
- We don't need a close game.
- Do you want to join us?

561
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:10,950
We have one seat available.

562
00:18:10,950 --> 00:18:13,470
I'm not going there.
Why would I go there?

563
00:18:13,470 --> 00:18:14,890
Let's just do this.

564
00:18:15,090 --> 00:18:17,840
- I'll do this on my own.
- It's 4 to 4 now.

565
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:19,570
Just wait for the next round.

566
00:18:20,570 --> 00:18:21,600
(Coming back)

567
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:23,780
Go away. Go over there.

568
00:18:23,780 --> 00:18:24,900
The majority loses.

569
00:18:24,900 --> 00:18:26,750
(The migratory bird Kwang Soo
comes back feeling small.)

570
00:18:26,750 --> 00:18:28,600
Whoever wins, we can
share the caramels.

571
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:29,640
That's right.

572
00:18:29,640 --> 00:18:31,220
They will mostly show rock.

573
00:18:31,220 --> 00:18:32,820
- That's true.
- So we should blow it.

574
00:18:32,840 --> 00:18:36,450
We should blow it and get
three caramels with scissors.

575
00:18:36,450 --> 00:18:37,910
We're not playing this one time.

576
00:18:38,060 --> 00:18:39,530
- Three will be enough.
- Suk Jin.

577
00:18:39,530 --> 00:18:40,790
So they can't win.

578
00:18:40,790 --> 00:18:42,850
Sure. It's all about
the probability.

579
00:18:42,850 --> 00:18:44,090
- We all should show this?
- Yes.

580
00:18:44,090 --> 00:18:46,070
We should blow it.
Otherwise, the minority will win.

581
00:18:46,070 --> 00:18:48,500
- It will ruin their plan as well.
- Okay.

582
00:18:48,500 --> 00:18:49,930
- Let's go.
- Let's do this.

583
00:18:49,930 --> 00:18:51,590
We have to be the minority.

584
00:18:51,590 --> 00:18:53,810
Please show your card
as I count to three.

585
00:18:53,810 --> 00:18:54,900
Okay.

586
00:18:54,970 --> 00:18:56,040
One.

587
00:18:56,430 --> 00:18:57,580
(The two gangs have
different strategies.)

588
00:18:57,580 --> 00:18:58,580
Two.

589
00:18:58,980 --> 00:19:00,050
Three.

590
00:19:00,670 --> 00:19:02,750
(Paper, paper, rock, scissors)

591
00:19:02,750 --> 00:19:04,250
(Scissors, rock, rock, rock)

592
00:19:04,250 --> 00:19:05,520
- Which one won?
- Hang on.

593
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:06,790
- My gosh.
- It's paper.

594
00:19:06,790 --> 00:19:09,090
Those with scissors and paper
will get caramels each.

595
00:19:09,090 --> 00:19:10,410
Okay!

596
00:19:10,410 --> 00:19:11,410
Scissors and paper.

597
00:19:11,410 --> 00:19:12,850
- Okay.
- You said you'd show scissors.

598
00:19:12,850 --> 00:19:14,760
- Why did you not show scissors?
- Scissors and paper.

599
00:19:14,760 --> 00:19:16,350
Those who showed scissors
get three caramels,

600
00:19:16,350 --> 00:19:18,420
and those who showed paper
get one caramel each.

601
00:19:18,420 --> 00:19:20,190
- It's okay.
- Is it all right?

602
00:19:20,190 --> 00:19:21,620
We got one caramel.

603
00:19:21,690 --> 00:19:22,970
We can do this five times.

604
00:19:22,970 --> 00:19:24,040
Okay. Good.

605
00:19:24,040 --> 00:19:26,430
- Did you play it randomly?
- Yes, we did.

606
00:19:26,510 --> 00:19:29,010
That's our strategy.

607
00:19:29,010 --> 00:19:30,170
It's confusing because
they're playing randomly.

608
00:19:30,170 --> 00:19:31,900
- Let's play randomly then.
- Okay.

609
00:19:31,900 --> 00:19:33,170
Let's play randomly.
We can't plan anything.

610
00:19:33,170 --> 00:19:34,780
- I think we should play randomly.
- Let's do this randomly.

611
00:19:34,780 --> 00:19:36,910
- We will share caramels anyway.
- Sure.

612
00:19:36,910 --> 00:19:39,380
We're not sharing caramels.

613
00:19:39,380 --> 00:19:40,750
- We just earn our own caramels.
- Okay.

614
00:19:40,750 --> 00:19:42,220
- All right. Good.
- Let's do this.

615
00:19:42,220 --> 00:19:44,990
Our second card is scissors again.

616
00:19:44,990 --> 00:19:46,880
(The second card is scissors.)

617
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:48,030
Aren't you planning anything?

618
00:19:48,180 --> 00:19:50,000
We're just playing it randomly.

619
00:19:50,190 --> 00:19:52,390
We have no plan.

620
00:19:52,650 --> 00:19:53,800
Let's just do this.

621
00:19:53,800 --> 00:19:55,660
I'll show rock for sure.
I'll blow this.

622
00:19:55,660 --> 00:19:56,740
Me too.

623
00:19:56,930 --> 00:19:58,130
- I'll show rock.
- You know it, right?

624
00:19:58,800 --> 00:19:59,930
- One.
- I should be the minority.

625
00:20:00,010 --> 00:20:01,660
2, and 3.

626
00:20:01,660 --> 00:20:02,700
This is it!

627
00:20:02,700 --> 00:20:03,840
- Scissors.
- Is there rock?

628
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:05,080
There's no scissors.

629
00:20:05,080 --> 00:20:08,050
- Scissors.
- Scissors!

630
00:20:08,050 --> 00:20:10,170
- Scissors!
- No. Wait, no.

631
00:20:10,170 --> 00:20:11,780
Ji Hyo showed paper alone.

632
00:20:11,780 --> 00:20:13,380
(Ji Hyo showed paper alone.)

633
00:20:13,990 --> 00:20:15,880
(Ji Hyo showed paper alone
and got a caramel.)

634
00:20:15,880 --> 00:20:18,180
- Paper?
- There was paper?

635
00:20:18,180 --> 00:20:19,320
- That's it.
- Ji Hyo.

636
00:20:19,380 --> 00:20:20,490
My goodness.

637
00:20:20,490 --> 00:20:22,230
- That's it.
- There was a paper?

638
00:20:22,230 --> 00:20:25,850
Ji Hyo got 1,
and everyone else lost 1.

639
00:20:26,090 --> 00:20:28,090
Hey. Your throat must hurt.

640
00:20:28,120 --> 00:20:29,930
(Annoyed)

641
00:20:29,930 --> 00:20:31,660
- Your throat must hurt.
- I'm going to choose randomly.

642
00:20:31,660 --> 00:20:34,310
I'm just going to choose randomly
without thinking about it.

643
00:20:34,310 --> 00:20:36,070
- Hey, Song Ji Hyo!
- I'm...

644
00:20:36,070 --> 00:20:38,280
Why are you ruining everything?

645
00:20:38,280 --> 00:20:39,670
- What do you mean?
- It's not Ji Hyo's fault.

646
00:20:39,670 --> 00:20:41,100
- She's just trying to survive.
- But...

647
00:20:41,100 --> 00:20:43,370
- It's not about survival,
- Honestly,

648
00:20:43,480 --> 00:20:44,820
- it's better than us losing...
- Yes?

649
00:20:44,820 --> 00:20:45,840
because it was preplanned.

650
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:47,490
- Wait, Jong Kook.
- It would make us angrier.

651
00:20:47,490 --> 00:20:48,640
Isn't he the chairman?

652
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:49,760
I am.

653
00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:51,180
The chairman is trying to talk,
and you're sitting there...

654
00:20:51,180 --> 00:20:52,760
- Nonetheless...
- and cutting him off.

655
00:20:52,760 --> 00:20:56,300
You cut him off,
and he stopped talking immediately.

656
00:20:56,300 --> 00:20:58,230
What is the role of the chairman?

657
00:20:58,390 --> 00:21:00,160
That's just his name.

658
00:21:00,500 --> 00:21:02,190
- His name is Chairman.
- Chairman.

659
00:21:02,730 --> 00:21:05,390
- Ji Hyo. Don't put out a rock.
- Let's do this!

660
00:21:05,390 --> 00:21:07,240
I'll take care of it.

661
00:21:07,930 --> 00:21:09,270
Mind your business.

662
00:21:09,270 --> 00:21:10,630
- Even your outfit is...
- You're...

663
00:21:10,630 --> 00:21:12,130
"Lady Vengeance", aren't you?

664
00:21:12,540 --> 00:21:14,200
- How dare you talk to me like that?
- I'm Madam Song,

665
00:21:14,200 --> 00:21:15,440
and I graduated from
Ewha Womans University.

666
00:21:15,580 --> 00:21:17,170
Did you just talk down
to the chairman?

667
00:21:17,170 --> 00:21:20,720
Be quiet.
How dare you talk back to me?

668
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:21,720
(She's focused on her role.)

669
00:21:21,720 --> 00:21:25,090
What are you saying?
I'm the chairman.

670
00:21:25,090 --> 00:21:26,380
You're not our chairman.

671
00:21:26,380 --> 00:21:27,450
I'm the chairman!

672
00:21:27,450 --> 00:21:29,380
- This won't do.
- Why did you put this inside?

673
00:21:29,380 --> 00:21:30,800
This won't do. Remove her seat.

674
00:21:31,190 --> 00:21:32,190
Why are you removing her seat?

675
00:21:32,190 --> 00:21:33,300
Because I'm the chairman.

676
00:21:33,300 --> 00:21:36,860
Give it back to me. Why are you
removing someone else's chair?

677
00:21:37,040 --> 00:21:38,890
- Good job, Ji Hyo.
- My goodness.

678
00:21:38,890 --> 00:21:40,470
What was that sound?

679
00:21:40,510 --> 00:21:43,870
My gosh. It's getting more violent.

680
00:21:43,870 --> 00:21:46,280
That was good.
Ji Hyo, you did a good job.

681
00:21:46,280 --> 00:21:47,670
- This was...
- Good job.

682
00:21:47,670 --> 00:21:50,080
Thanks. I had an itch there.

683
00:21:50,220 --> 00:21:51,220
Thanks.

684
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:53,880
Ji Hyo. You did a good job.

685
00:21:54,290 --> 00:21:55,490
That was refreshing.

686
00:21:55,490 --> 00:21:56,950
It sounded like
a watermelon cracking.

687
00:21:56,950 --> 00:21:58,020
You didn't watch "Intruder",
did you?

688
00:21:58,020 --> 00:21:59,220
You don't know how scary she is,
do you?

689
00:21:59,220 --> 00:22:00,850
I didn't watch it.
I'm never going to watch it.

690
00:22:00,850 --> 00:22:01,990
I'm going to save myself 11 dollars.

691
00:22:01,990 --> 00:22:03,500
My gosh. He's so childish.

692
00:22:03,500 --> 00:22:05,500
- He's so childish.
- I'll watch it when it's free.

693
00:22:05,500 --> 00:22:06,830
Suk Jin looked so cute...

694
00:22:06,830 --> 00:22:08,390
when he was embarrassed
after getting hit by Ji Hyo.

695
00:22:08,830 --> 00:22:10,590
(The chairman ended his tyranny
due to his embarrassment.)

696
00:22:10,590 --> 00:22:12,300
He deserved to get hit.

697
00:22:12,300 --> 00:22:14,570
- Okay, the third is...
- Okay.

698
00:22:14,660 --> 00:22:15,700
scissors.

699
00:22:15,700 --> 00:22:18,100
We have to plan this.
We have 7 to 8 caramels...

700
00:22:18,100 --> 00:22:19,940
more than that team...

701
00:22:19,940 --> 00:22:21,340
- over there.
- Right.

702
00:22:21,340 --> 00:22:22,910
So we should go on the defense.

703
00:22:22,910 --> 00:22:24,550
Let's prevent them from
turning the tables.

704
00:22:24,550 --> 00:22:25,640
We just need to prevent them
from turning the tables.

705
00:22:25,640 --> 00:22:26,990
We have to prevent them from
getting a big one.

706
00:22:26,990 --> 00:22:28,910
- Okay.
- What are we doing? Is it random?

707
00:22:29,110 --> 00:22:31,110
- Hold on.
- Let's split it this time.

708
00:22:31,110 --> 00:22:32,650
- Okay. For this round.
- Kwang Soo.

709
00:22:32,650 --> 00:22:33,850
- What are we doing?
- They might try...

710
00:22:33,850 --> 00:22:35,030
to get everything at the end.

711
00:22:35,030 --> 00:22:36,650
Some of us should get tied
with them.

712
00:22:36,650 --> 00:22:38,000
Let's do that.

713
00:22:38,590 --> 00:22:39,590
- Then...
- Then...

714
00:22:39,590 --> 00:22:41,190
Kwang Soo and I will
get a tie with them.

715
00:22:41,190 --> 00:22:42,230
(Try to get a caramel by interfering
with their plan to get a tie...)

716
00:22:42,230 --> 00:22:43,240
You will put out a rock.

717
00:22:43,240 --> 00:22:44,240
(and put out one different card.)

718
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:45,470
You will put out paper.

719
00:22:46,090 --> 00:22:47,570
- Okay.
- Jae Suk...

720
00:22:47,570 --> 00:22:49,470
- is getting competitive.
- He is.

721
00:22:49,980 --> 00:22:51,130
But we figured that out.

722
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:52,980
Okay. One,

723
00:22:53,840 --> 00:22:55,840
2, 3.

724
00:22:55,840 --> 00:22:57,280
(The two gangs used different
strategies, who will win?)

725
00:22:57,750 --> 00:22:59,880
(Scissors, paper, rock, scissors)

726
00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:01,840
(Scissors, rock, paper, rock)

727
00:23:02,050 --> 00:23:03,990
Song Ji Hyo and Yang Se Chan
who both put out paper.

728
00:23:03,990 --> 00:23:04,990
- Okay.
- Okay.

729
00:23:04,990 --> 00:23:07,030
It's okay. We both got one.

730
00:23:07,030 --> 00:23:08,180
(Those who put out a rock
or scissors will lose 1 each.)

731
00:23:08,180 --> 00:23:10,500
- Good job.
- I didn't get a single one.

732
00:23:11,190 --> 00:23:12,890
I didn't get a single one.

733
00:23:12,890 --> 00:23:14,300
We'll calculate everything
and hand them out.

734
00:23:14,300 --> 00:23:15,300
- Okay.
- Okay.

735
00:23:15,300 --> 00:23:17,190
- Kwang Soo, please step forward.
- Okay.

736
00:23:17,190 --> 00:23:18,890
What's with Kwang Soo?

737
00:23:19,090 --> 00:23:20,240
Lee Kwang Soo got five.

738
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:22,660
- Is Kwang Soo going up?
- He needs to give away three.

739
00:23:22,660 --> 00:23:24,280
I won't take one,

740
00:23:24,370 --> 00:23:26,370
but give one to So Min.

741
00:23:26,370 --> 00:23:28,100
- Or...
- You can give her one.

742
00:23:28,100 --> 00:23:30,140
- Okay.
- Just 1? I can give her 1.

743
00:23:30,170 --> 00:23:31,480
(Kwang Soo got 5 caramels.)

744
00:23:31,480 --> 00:23:32,870
- He got a lot.
- He has a lot.

745
00:23:32,870 --> 00:23:33,940
- That's a lot.
- Five...

746
00:23:33,940 --> 00:23:36,090
- Give us one each.
- After I see how much you get.

747
00:23:36,090 --> 00:23:37,350
- Let's see how many you get.
- I don't get any.

748
00:23:37,350 --> 00:23:38,380
You never know.

749
00:23:38,380 --> 00:23:40,950
We have our eyes on you, Kwang Soo.

750
00:23:40,950 --> 00:23:43,230
We can gather our influence
and make you the chairman.

751
00:23:43,230 --> 00:23:44,800
(Everyone is giving their attention
to Kwang Soo, who is rich.)

752
00:23:45,030 --> 00:23:46,420
Let's get a meal together.

753
00:23:46,920 --> 00:23:48,500
We could have a meal together.

754
00:23:49,390 --> 00:23:50,770
That's not a hard request.

755
00:23:50,770 --> 00:23:52,590
(His traitor DNA is starting
to move.)

756
00:23:53,010 --> 00:23:55,310
Okay. Haha got four.

757
00:23:55,310 --> 00:23:56,630
I got four, right? I knew it.

758
00:23:56,630 --> 00:23:57,630
- It's because they took some away.
- That's right.

759
00:23:57,630 --> 00:23:59,600
We each get one though.

760
00:23:59,670 --> 00:24:01,580
We got six.
Let's leave them in the middle.

761
00:24:01,580 --> 00:24:03,370
- Let's wait.
- Okay.

762
00:24:03,370 --> 00:24:05,280
Jong Kook, please return two.

763
00:24:05,280 --> 00:24:06,280
- Okay.
- Return?

764
00:24:06,280 --> 00:24:07,910
Just give them two from that pile.

765
00:24:07,910 --> 00:24:09,020
- Let's do that.
- Let's do that.

766
00:24:09,020 --> 00:24:10,760
- Should we do that for now?
- Of course.

767
00:24:10,760 --> 00:24:12,110
- We are one.
- This is nice.

768
00:24:12,110 --> 00:24:13,920
It's because
we played this round together.

769
00:24:13,920 --> 00:24:14,920
It's true.

770
00:24:14,920 --> 00:24:17,090
- Jeon So Min, return two.
- Yes?

771
00:24:17,190 --> 00:24:18,190
- What?
- Return two.

772
00:24:18,190 --> 00:24:19,890
Kwang Soo.
Give them two on her behalf.

773
00:24:19,890 --> 00:24:21,190
- You should do that.
- It's not that.

774
00:24:21,190 --> 00:24:22,860
Give them two on her behalf.

775
00:24:22,860 --> 00:24:24,390
I have the same amount as her
because I won some in this round.

776
00:24:24,390 --> 00:24:26,130
- No, I...
- So Min, return one each.

777
00:24:26,130 --> 00:24:27,130
- Yes, do that.
- Kwang Soo can return one,

778
00:24:27,130 --> 00:24:28,130
- and you can return 1.
- Right, 1 each.

779
00:24:28,130 --> 00:24:29,510
Let's play rock-paper-scissors,
and loser returns two.

780
00:24:29,510 --> 00:24:30,540
Okay, sounds good.

781
00:24:31,010 --> 00:24:32,900
- I like that idea.
- Those Tiger Moths.

782
00:24:32,900 --> 00:24:34,050
Let's do this.

783
00:24:34,100 --> 00:24:35,550
- The loser returns two.
- Okay.

784
00:24:35,550 --> 00:24:37,220
- Okay. The loser returns two.
- Rock...

785
00:24:37,220 --> 00:24:39,080
- Rock-paper-scissors, shoot.
- Shoot.

786
00:24:39,410 --> 00:24:40,790
(Kwang Soo put out paper.)

787
00:24:40,790 --> 00:24:42,140
- Rock-paper-scissors, shoot.
- Shoot.

788
00:24:42,140 --> 00:24:43,180
(So Min put out...)

789
00:24:43,180 --> 00:24:45,220
(What? There are two cards.)

790
00:24:45,790 --> 00:24:46,920
Why would you put out two cards?

791
00:24:46,920 --> 00:24:47,920
This one is in the front.

792
00:24:47,920 --> 00:24:48,950
- My goodness.
- Why would you...

793
00:24:48,950 --> 00:24:50,560
- put out two cards?
- No. This one is in the front.

794
00:24:50,560 --> 00:24:52,000
These two are something else.

795
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,000
- Just put out one.
- I did this. Okay, fine. Just one.

796
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:55,090
(They re-do the match properly.)

797
00:24:55,090 --> 00:24:56,500
Rock-paper-scissors.

798
00:24:56,930 --> 00:24:57,970
Let me see.

799
00:24:57,970 --> 00:24:59,240
(Kwang Soo wins.)

800
00:24:59,240 --> 00:25:01,160
- Okay.
- Darn it.

801
00:25:01,860 --> 00:25:03,340
(Throwing)

802
00:25:03,810 --> 00:25:05,630
She's returning the ones she owes.
Why is she throwing a fit?

803
00:25:05,980 --> 00:25:07,280
It's not that.

804
00:25:07,280 --> 00:25:08,280
It's hers.

805
00:25:08,280 --> 00:25:10,370
So Min, you were a bit strange
in this case.

806
00:25:10,370 --> 00:25:11,480
So Min.

807
00:25:12,550 --> 00:25:13,590
Let's play rock-paper-scissors.

808
00:25:13,880 --> 00:25:14,910
- Don't you want...
- Chairman.

809
00:25:14,910 --> 00:25:16,290
- to become chairman again?
- No, I...

810
00:25:16,290 --> 00:25:17,650
Don't you want to become
the second chairman as well?

811
00:25:17,650 --> 00:25:19,650
Everyone got 9 earlier,
but I only got 6.

812
00:25:19,650 --> 00:25:21,290
Don't you want to become
the second chairman as well?

813
00:25:21,560 --> 00:25:23,760
- Chairman.
- This isn't a comfortable position.

814
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:26,030
- You should serve a second term.
- I... This...

815
00:25:26,030 --> 00:25:27,090
- You should serve a second term.
- You should...

816
00:25:27,090 --> 00:25:29,090
- see it to the end.
- Yes, that's right.

817
00:25:29,090 --> 00:25:30,090
- Hold on.
- Hey.

818
00:25:30,090 --> 00:25:32,040
What do you keep eating?

819
00:25:32,040 --> 00:25:33,040
What's Jae Suk eating?

820
00:25:33,040 --> 00:25:34,600
- Are you eating a caramel?
- It's a caramel.

821
00:25:34,600 --> 00:25:37,580
(What? He's eating a caramel?)

822
00:25:37,700 --> 00:25:38,840
Wait.

823
00:25:38,870 --> 00:25:39,940
Get over here.

824
00:25:40,340 --> 00:25:41,700
- You!
- Is he a thief?

825
00:25:41,700 --> 00:25:43,550
5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10.

826
00:25:43,870 --> 00:25:45,220
Gosh, get over here.

827
00:25:45,910 --> 00:25:48,440
I'm missing two.
How many did you eat?

828
00:25:48,440 --> 00:25:49,640
I ate one.

829
00:25:50,150 --> 00:25:52,760
(It's a segment within a segment.
It's Two-Seoks.)

830
00:25:53,850 --> 00:25:56,450
2, 4, 6, 8, 10.

831
00:25:56,450 --> 00:25:58,760
It tastes so good since
it's been a while since I had one.

832
00:25:59,730 --> 00:26:01,770
Let's move on to the second mission.

833
00:26:01,770 --> 00:26:03,000
- Yes.
- Okay!

834
00:26:03,300 --> 00:26:05,190
Okay! Good.

835
00:26:05,190 --> 00:26:06,360
(Current Number of Caramels,
Jong Kook 20, Se Chan 20, Haha 19)

836
00:26:06,360 --> 00:26:07,660
(Ji Hyo 13, Suk Jin 13,
Jae Suk 12, Kwang Soo 12, So Min 9)

837
00:26:08,860 --> 00:26:10,670
There's a soccer goalpost here.

838
00:26:10,670 --> 00:26:11,670
What is this?

839
00:26:11,670 --> 00:26:13,640
There's a soccer goalpost here.

840
00:26:13,870 --> 00:26:15,600
- Is it soccer?
- Is it soccer?

841
00:26:15,940 --> 00:26:16,940
What is this?

842
00:26:16,940 --> 00:26:19,370
Are we kicking balls
with our eyes covered?

843
00:26:19,790 --> 00:26:22,090
"No violence
under any circumstances."

844
00:26:22,090 --> 00:26:24,450
Something's going on. What are the
rules that card sharks must follow?

845
00:26:24,450 --> 00:26:25,650
(A spoiler: This rule will be
ignored in this round.)

846
00:26:25,650 --> 00:26:26,990
In this mission,

847
00:26:26,990 --> 00:26:28,880
you must be able to read the
opposing team's strategy...

848
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:30,500
in order to prevent a goal
or get a goal.

849
00:26:30,500 --> 00:26:32,000
It is Brain Shoot Out.

850
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:33,000
(Brain Shoot Out is where you must
read your opposing team to win.)

851
00:26:33,230 --> 00:26:34,920
It is a shoot-out match where...

852
00:26:34,920 --> 00:26:36,660
you will divide into 2 teams of 4
and rotate from defense to offense.

853
00:26:36,660 --> 00:26:40,130
The 4 members of Team Offense
will have 4 tries to hit 10 balls.

854
00:26:40,130 --> 00:26:43,280
They can choose when and how many
balls each member will hit.

855
00:26:43,280 --> 00:26:45,900
Team Defense will put on
blindfolds and headphones...

856
00:26:45,900 --> 00:26:48,440
and take turns as goalkeepers
for one minute each.

857
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:49,510
We have to wear blindfolds?

858
00:26:49,550 --> 00:26:52,610
After one minute, the goalkeeper
will remove their headphones...

859
00:26:52,670 --> 00:26:55,640
and guess whether or not
there were any goals...

860
00:26:55,640 --> 00:26:58,650
and blow the whistle to
invalidate the goals.

861
00:26:59,450 --> 00:27:02,560
For example,
if Team Offense got 2 or 3 goals in,

862
00:27:02,560 --> 00:27:03,890
but the goalkeeper
blows the whistle,

863
00:27:03,890 --> 00:27:05,390
it will become
Team Defense's goal...

864
00:27:05,390 --> 00:27:06,970
- It'll be invalid.
- as you can see over there.

865
00:27:06,970 --> 00:27:08,000
(If there are 2 goals and Jae Suk
blows the whistle, he gets them.)

866
00:27:08,120 --> 00:27:09,590
- It's a game of wits.
- If he doesn't blow the whistle,

867
00:27:09,590 --> 00:27:10,890
Team Offense gets the points.

868
00:27:10,890 --> 00:27:13,660
If Team Offense didn't get
any goals, but the whistle is blown,

869
00:27:13,660 --> 00:27:15,740
Team Defense must return
one caramel each.

870
00:27:16,340 --> 00:27:18,600
If there were no goals and no
whistles blown, nothing happens.

871
00:27:19,370 --> 00:27:21,550
However,
only 2 of the 4 goalkeepers...

872
00:27:21,550 --> 00:27:23,610
can blow the whistle.

873
00:27:23,980 --> 00:27:25,370
They might not make a goal
on purpose.

874
00:27:25,670 --> 00:27:27,940
Okay, can the chairman come up and
divide everyone into teams of four,

875
00:27:27,940 --> 00:27:29,380
so we can play the game?

876
00:27:29,380 --> 00:27:31,290
- Goodness.
- He's doing his role.

877
00:27:31,290 --> 00:27:32,290
He's finally doing something.

878
00:27:32,290 --> 00:27:33,730
It's time for the chairman...

879
00:27:33,730 --> 00:27:35,120
He finally gets to show off
his role as chairman.

880
00:27:35,490 --> 00:27:36,490
He's playing his role.

881
00:27:36,490 --> 00:27:38,030
I get to play my role.

882
00:27:38,030 --> 00:27:39,650
- Salute.
- Chairman.

883
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:42,970
I think our family should
continue working together.

884
00:27:42,970 --> 00:27:44,740
Well, I guess...

885
00:27:44,740 --> 00:27:46,470
Family? Who are you talking about?

886
00:27:46,470 --> 00:27:48,010
The people who supported me.

887
00:27:48,510 --> 00:27:49,700
We're a family.

888
00:27:49,900 --> 00:27:51,080
- They supported me.
- I'm dumbfounded.

889
00:27:51,080 --> 00:27:52,580
- I'm dumbfounded.
- Don't you think so?

890
00:27:52,580 --> 00:27:54,170
- That's fine.
- If it's divided like that,

891
00:27:54,170 --> 00:27:55,480
we have to win at all costs.

892
00:27:55,480 --> 00:27:56,480
Of course.

893
00:27:56,910 --> 00:27:58,480
Are you interested in
joining my team?

894
00:27:58,480 --> 00:27:59,820
I've been wanting to join.

895
00:27:59,820 --> 00:28:00,910
(Politely)

896
00:28:01,090 --> 00:28:03,490
(I am always thinking of you,
Chairman Jee.)

897
00:28:03,490 --> 00:28:06,290
I wanted to join,
but there was no space for me.

898
00:28:06,290 --> 00:28:08,180
Goodness, if that's the case...

899
00:28:08,180 --> 00:28:10,090
You have a high chance of winning.

900
00:28:10,090 --> 00:28:11,090
What is this?

901
00:28:11,590 --> 00:28:13,360
I want to join your team.

902
00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:14,920
- Will you give me a caramel then?
- Yes.

903
00:28:15,500 --> 00:28:17,840
You're going to choose Jong Kook
again, right?

904
00:28:17,840 --> 00:28:19,740
Of course. Join our team.

905
00:28:19,740 --> 00:28:21,400
I want to see who you pick first.

906
00:28:21,400 --> 00:28:22,400
- Join my team.
- I want to see who you pick first.

907
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:23,900
That means I need to get rid of
one person.

908
00:28:23,900 --> 00:28:24,900
- Hold on.
- I want to see who you pick first.

909
00:28:24,900 --> 00:28:26,480
First, Jong Kook is on my team.

910
00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:27,980
- Jong Kook is...
- My goodness.

911
00:28:27,980 --> 00:28:29,640
- My goodness.
- Jong Kook is on my team.

912
00:28:29,640 --> 00:28:30,940
He plays dirty.

913
00:28:30,940 --> 00:28:32,140
Jong Kook, come here.

914
00:28:32,550 --> 00:28:34,840
Suk Jin, we were on the same team,
but you're...

915
00:28:34,910 --> 00:28:36,380
- Okay, fine. Haha.
- Let's go.

916
00:28:36,380 --> 00:28:37,820
- Let's team up.
- Okay.

917
00:28:37,820 --> 00:28:39,380
- Okay.
- Okay, So Min!

918
00:28:39,490 --> 00:28:41,180
Will you join and give me one? Okay.

919
00:28:41,180 --> 00:28:42,290
Okay, So Min!

920
00:28:42,290 --> 00:28:44,590
Goodness. He's the worst.

921
00:28:44,590 --> 00:28:46,300
(Chairman Jee,
A monster born out of capitalism)

922
00:28:46,300 --> 00:28:47,570
- What just happened?
- Suk Jin.

923
00:28:47,570 --> 00:28:48,770
Okay. I got it.

924
00:28:49,030 --> 00:28:50,130
We need to get caramels.

925
00:28:50,130 --> 00:28:51,300
So Min.

926
00:28:51,300 --> 00:28:52,300
(Secretly)

927
00:28:52,540 --> 00:28:53,840
We need to get caramels.

928
00:28:53,840 --> 00:28:55,130
- Kwang Soo!
- Okay.

929
00:28:55,130 --> 00:28:56,130
(Smiling)

930
00:28:56,130 --> 00:28:57,170
(Through active lobbying, he's the
last to join the chairman's team.)

931
00:28:57,170 --> 00:28:59,240
Gosh, this is... For this one...

932
00:29:00,580 --> 00:29:02,170
- We're strong too.
- If this is the case...

933
00:29:02,170 --> 00:29:03,720
- Okay.
- We have to band together.

934
00:29:03,720 --> 00:29:04,870
We'll do our best.

935
00:29:04,870 --> 00:29:06,370
Please support me.
I can do a good job.

936
00:29:06,370 --> 00:29:07,590
- I'll do my best. Seriously.
- We need to...

937
00:29:07,590 --> 00:29:08,590
- win.
- The second chairman will be...

938
00:29:08,590 --> 00:29:09,590
- one of us.
- Okay.

939
00:29:09,590 --> 00:29:10,590
- No matter what.
- The second chairman will be...

940
00:29:10,590 --> 00:29:11,760
- one of us.
- Okay.

941
00:29:11,760 --> 00:29:13,730
- We are at an advantage because...
- This is psychological warfare.

942
00:29:13,730 --> 00:29:14,790
the two members who play tricks
are here.

943
00:29:14,790 --> 00:29:15,830
You're right.

944
00:29:15,830 --> 00:29:17,890
We have the two members who
always play tricks on our team.

945
00:29:17,950 --> 00:29:18,950
- We have to do a good job.
- That's right.

946
00:29:18,950 --> 00:29:20,570
- Because we have these two,
- That's right.

947
00:29:20,570 --> 00:29:22,390
the opposing team
will have a headache.

948
00:29:22,390 --> 00:29:23,500
That's right.

949
00:29:23,500 --> 00:29:24,500
Is this how it is?

950
00:29:24,500 --> 00:29:26,130
Let's make Suk Jin regret it.

951
00:29:27,430 --> 00:29:30,980
We'll go on the offense first.
We'll go first.

952
00:29:30,980 --> 00:29:32,170
- I'll block it.
- Okay.

953
00:29:32,170 --> 00:29:33,170
(The first keeper for Jae Suk Gang
is Jae Suk.)

954
00:29:33,170 --> 00:29:34,200
Who's going first?

955
00:29:34,250 --> 00:29:35,780
(There will be 2 rounds,)

956
00:29:35,780 --> 00:29:37,720
(and the score after Round 2 will be
how many caramels they receive.)

957
00:29:37,870 --> 00:29:39,280
They might put in all the balls
at the beginning.

958
00:29:39,280 --> 00:29:40,520
I think that's what they'll do.

959
00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:42,590
I think we have to go with our gut.

960
00:29:42,910 --> 00:29:44,220
We can't tell you either.

961
00:29:44,220 --> 00:29:45,720
Right. There's nothing we can do.

962
00:29:46,850 --> 00:29:50,120
Let's score some goals
in the beginning.

963
00:29:50,120 --> 00:29:52,090
How about four goals
in the first round?

964
00:29:52,090 --> 00:29:53,090
So we divide it into two tries.

965
00:29:53,090 --> 00:29:54,800
- Let's do that.
- Do five.

966
00:29:54,800 --> 00:29:55,830
Okay.

967
00:29:56,030 --> 00:29:58,130
- This is nice.
- We have to put on blindfolds too.

968
00:29:58,130 --> 00:29:59,340
(Jae Suk is ready
with his eyes and ears covered.)

969
00:30:00,100 --> 00:30:02,130
You will have 1 minute in
round 1 of the 1st half.

970
00:30:02,600 --> 00:30:04,400
We will start now.
Turn on the music.

971
00:30:04,400 --> 00:30:05,400
(The first attack will start now.)

972
00:30:06,310 --> 00:30:07,640
This.

973
00:30:07,840 --> 00:30:09,370
Let's divide it into two turns.

974
00:30:09,550 --> 00:30:12,110
(How many goals will Suk Jin Gang
make in the first attack?)

975
00:30:12,110 --> 00:30:13,590
- Should I go now?
- We have to decide...

976
00:30:13,590 --> 00:30:15,050
whether or not to do it.

977
00:30:15,290 --> 00:30:16,790
(Hitting)

978
00:30:18,320 --> 00:30:20,420
(What just happened?)

979
00:30:22,650 --> 00:30:24,090
(Thump)

980
00:30:25,120 --> 00:30:26,120
(Wait...)

981
00:30:27,920 --> 00:30:30,070
- Suk Jin, seriously?
- Come on, Suk Jin.

982
00:30:30,300 --> 00:30:31,570
- Kwang Soo.
- What...

983
00:30:31,570 --> 00:30:33,660
- Where did you aim for?
- I...

984
00:30:33,660 --> 00:30:34,740
- Seriously?
- Kwang Soo, come on.

985
00:30:34,740 --> 00:30:36,930
I know Jae Suk
already has two kids,

986
00:30:36,930 --> 00:30:38,400
but you never know.

987
00:30:39,700 --> 00:30:41,340
(Hold on.)

988
00:30:41,940 --> 00:30:43,610
Why don't we split it
into two rounds?

989
00:30:44,440 --> 00:30:46,910
(She's going after the caramels.)

990
00:30:47,020 --> 00:30:49,220
(While others
are focused on the game,)

991
00:30:49,220 --> 00:30:51,490
(So Min tries
to break the rules again.)

992
00:30:53,730 --> 00:30:57,500
(She holds her breath
as she keeps at it.)

993
00:30:58,560 --> 00:31:01,660
(She manages to steal one.)

994
00:31:01,970 --> 00:31:03,930
(She's surprised
at how good she is.)

995
00:31:04,430 --> 00:31:06,470
(Jae Suk's clueless.)

996
00:31:07,360 --> 00:31:08,360
No way.

997
00:31:08,360 --> 00:31:09,430
(Sweet additional income)

998
00:31:09,930 --> 00:31:11,900
(She makes her way
over to him again.)

999
00:31:17,250 --> 00:31:18,610
(My hip sack...)

1000
00:31:18,610 --> 00:31:21,440
(Why is it open?)

1001
00:31:22,320 --> 00:31:25,020
(So Min manages
to steal two caramels.)

1002
00:31:25,910 --> 00:31:27,450
(Kwang Soo wants in on the profit,)

1003
00:31:27,450 --> 00:31:28,880
(so he tries to steal some too.)

1004
00:31:29,590 --> 00:31:30,920
(Groping)

1005
00:31:32,560 --> 00:31:33,860
(Darn you!)

1006
00:31:35,270 --> 00:31:37,190
(Just hand them over!)

1007
00:31:37,190 --> 00:31:40,240
(The first act of violence occurs.)

1008
00:31:42,630 --> 00:31:43,740
Hold still.

1009
00:31:44,870 --> 00:31:46,010
(What's going on?)

1010
00:31:46,010 --> 00:31:47,080
Hold still.

1011
00:31:47,250 --> 00:31:48,640
(Blinded by greed,)

1012
00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:50,480
(Kwang Soo breaks the rules.)

1013
00:31:50,750 --> 00:31:51,820
Five seconds.

1014
00:31:52,610 --> 00:31:56,820
4, 3, 2, 1.

1015
00:31:57,650 --> 00:31:59,090
(Their 1 minute is over.)

1016
00:31:59,090 --> 00:32:00,150
No way.

1017
00:32:01,830 --> 00:32:02,990
Jae Suk, you're up.

1018
00:32:02,990 --> 00:32:04,090
(If Jae Suk blows the whistle,)

1019
00:32:04,090 --> 00:32:05,230
(his team will win 4 points.)

1020
00:32:05,230 --> 00:32:06,230
One,

1021
00:32:07,030 --> 00:32:08,070
two...

1022
00:32:08,070 --> 00:32:09,420
(If he doesn't blow the whistle,)

1023
00:32:09,420 --> 00:32:10,840
(Team Offense will win 4 points.)

1024
00:32:10,840 --> 00:32:12,270
(The whistle can only be
blown twice, so what will it be?)

1025
00:32:12,270 --> 00:32:13,300
Three!

1026
00:32:13,300 --> 00:32:14,970
(The whistle can only be
blown twice, so what will it be?)

1027
00:32:14,970 --> 00:32:16,040
Three!

1028
00:32:16,040 --> 00:32:18,010
(He blew the whistle.)

1029
00:32:18,010 --> 00:32:19,280
(Jae Suk's hunch was right,
and he wins four goals!)

1030
00:32:19,280 --> 00:32:21,100
Jae Suk, you won four goals.

1031
00:32:21,100 --> 00:32:22,400
That's four.

1032
00:32:22,400 --> 00:32:24,320
(Suk Jin Gang 0, Jae Suk Gang 4)

1033
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:25,750
See? They kicked four in.

1034
00:32:25,750 --> 00:32:26,940
- Didn't I do well?
- You did.

1035
00:32:27,590 --> 00:32:29,090
I didn't think
he'd blow the whistle.

1036
00:32:31,290 --> 00:32:33,090
This is the most important round.

1037
00:32:33,320 --> 00:32:34,950
This has turned into a mind game.

1038
00:32:35,330 --> 00:32:36,590
Who'll go next?

1039
00:32:36,590 --> 00:32:37,890
- Ji Hyo, go ahead.
- Ji Hyo, you're up.

1040
00:32:37,890 --> 00:32:38,950
It can be no one else.

1041
00:32:39,230 --> 00:32:40,500
We have another chance anyway.

1042
00:32:40,500 --> 00:32:41,590
Is it you?

1043
00:32:41,590 --> 00:32:42,770
- Is it Ji Hyo?
- Really?

1044
00:32:42,770 --> 00:32:43,890
Let's think of how she is.

1045
00:32:43,890 --> 00:32:45,770
- I can't read her.
- She's not readable.

1046
00:32:45,770 --> 00:32:47,010
- Not at all.
- Ji Hyo's a wild card.

1047
00:32:47,010 --> 00:32:48,630
I can't tell how she'll react.

1048
00:32:50,010 --> 00:32:51,400
- What?
- What are you doing?

1049
00:32:52,200 --> 00:32:53,600
- What?
- What are you doing?

1050
00:32:54,510 --> 00:32:55,780
- Nice.
- Are you taking a nap?

1051
00:32:55,780 --> 00:32:57,140
- Are you taking a nap?
- What are you doing?

1052
00:32:57,140 --> 00:32:58,670
(Is she taking a nap
or blocking the goal?)

1053
00:32:58,670 --> 00:32:59,720
Your minute begins now.

1054
00:33:00,140 --> 00:33:01,720
(Their minute begins.)

1055
00:33:03,090 --> 00:33:04,880
(Dragging)

1056
00:33:05,610 --> 00:33:08,490
(Instead of playing mind games,
they drag her away.)

1057
00:33:10,560 --> 00:33:13,570
(However...)

1058
00:33:13,570 --> 00:33:14,690
I can't believe
you found your way back.

1059
00:33:14,920 --> 00:33:17,000
Did you see that? She made it back.

1060
00:33:17,930 --> 00:33:19,360
She's back where she started.

1061
00:33:19,360 --> 00:33:21,310
How can she get to her spot?
Can she see?

1062
00:33:21,310 --> 00:33:22,340
(Relaxed)

1063
00:33:22,970 --> 00:33:25,130
She might be able to see.

1064
00:33:25,130 --> 00:33:26,700
Maybe not.

1065
00:33:26,700 --> 00:33:27,980
Three,

1066
00:33:27,980 --> 00:33:30,580
2, 1.

1067
00:33:31,610 --> 00:33:34,020
Please finalize your decision.
Are you done?

1068
00:33:34,020 --> 00:33:35,110
Wait...

1069
00:33:36,590 --> 00:33:37,610
Are you done?

1070
00:33:38,090 --> 00:33:41,620
(She gets rid of a ball
by tossing and turning.)

1071
00:33:42,060 --> 00:33:43,760
(Kwang Soo's truly flustered.)

1072
00:33:44,390 --> 00:33:46,030
- She kicked one out.
- It's over. This doesn't count.

1073
00:33:46,970 --> 00:33:48,360
(Only 2 balls remain in the goal.)

1074
00:33:48,360 --> 00:33:49,420
Ji Hyo, you're up.

1075
00:33:49,890 --> 00:33:51,590
Will you blow the whistle or not?

1076
00:33:51,590 --> 00:33:53,040
I have no idea what she'll do.

1077
00:33:53,430 --> 00:33:56,810
1, 2, 3.

1078
00:33:56,810 --> 00:33:58,040
(No one knows
how Ji Hyo will react.)

1079
00:34:00,010 --> 00:34:01,510
- She didn't blow it.
- She didn't blow the whistle.

1080
00:34:02,010 --> 00:34:03,870
- This was placed inside the goal.
- I know.

1081
00:34:04,320 --> 00:34:06,250
- You did well.
- Good choice.

1082
00:34:06,610 --> 00:34:08,590
- Okay.
- But this rolled out.

1083
00:34:08,940 --> 00:34:10,990
Se Chan, you're up. You've got this.

1084
00:34:10,990 --> 00:34:13,220
- Go, Se Chan.
- We now have a 50-50 chance.

1085
00:34:13,220 --> 00:34:14,930
Do we score half
of the remaining balls?

1086
00:34:14,930 --> 00:34:16,530
We'll at least win
one of those rounds.

1087
00:34:16,530 --> 00:34:18,220
- Or we could go all-in.
- All at once.

1088
00:34:19,050 --> 00:34:20,720
- Go ahead.
- Let's go.

1089
00:34:20,720 --> 00:34:22,220
- Se Chan, you've got this.
- All right!

1090
00:34:23,490 --> 00:34:24,970
Cue, music.

1091
00:34:24,970 --> 00:34:26,100
(The third round begins.)

1092
00:34:31,370 --> 00:34:32,700
I sense something.

1093
00:34:33,700 --> 00:34:35,410
(Se Chan quickly escapes.)

1094
00:34:35,410 --> 00:34:36,640
Where are you off to?

1095
00:34:36,640 --> 00:34:39,070
(So Min won't leave his side.)

1096
00:34:39,780 --> 00:34:41,410
(He touched So Min,)

1097
00:34:41,410 --> 00:34:42,620
(but he moves to the side
without pushing her.)

1098
00:34:42,620 --> 00:34:44,010
Se Chan can't be cruel.

1099
00:34:44,010 --> 00:34:46,050
- He won't even push you.
- I know.

1100
00:34:46,050 --> 00:34:47,620
(Se Chan can't seem
to be harsh with her.)

1101
00:34:48,850 --> 00:34:51,550
3, 2, 1.

1102
00:34:51,550 --> 00:34:53,320
I'm glad he's not on my team.

1103
00:34:53,320 --> 00:34:54,470
(How many goals
did Suk Jin Gang score?)

1104
00:34:54,470 --> 00:34:56,390
(Only two keepers remain.)

1105
00:34:56,390 --> 00:34:58,370
1, 2...

1106
00:34:58,370 --> 00:34:59,490
(Will he blow the whistle
or save it for the next round?)

1107
00:34:59,490 --> 00:35:00,800
- Three!
- I won't blow it.

1108
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:02,910
(I won't blow it.)

1109
00:35:03,100 --> 00:35:05,970
(How many points
did Team Offense score?)

1110
00:35:11,640 --> 00:35:13,950
- We scored all the balls we had.
- We knew it.

1111
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:15,950
(They guessed that Se Chan
wouldn't blow the whistle...)

1112
00:35:15,950 --> 00:35:17,590
(and scored all of their
remaining balls.)

1113
00:35:17,590 --> 00:35:19,590
I love how my teammates...

1114
00:35:19,590 --> 00:35:21,120
are all so cunning.

1115
00:35:21,120 --> 00:35:23,550
- I got goosebumps.
- It was such a good choice...

1116
00:35:23,550 --> 00:35:25,260
to bring on board
two cunning members.

1117
00:35:25,260 --> 00:35:27,620
You will play defense this time.

1118
00:35:28,570 --> 00:35:29,720
It's a confusing game.

1119
00:35:29,720 --> 00:35:32,200
(Suk Jin Gang
will play keepers this time.)

1120
00:35:35,030 --> 00:35:36,240
I can't...

1121
00:35:36,470 --> 00:35:38,300
I can't ask them
to keep it safe for me...

1122
00:35:38,300 --> 00:35:39,840
because they'll only
end up stealing it.

1123
00:35:39,840 --> 00:35:41,180
Unbelievable.

1124
00:35:41,470 --> 00:35:43,350
- Who do I give it to?
- Look here.

1125
00:35:44,140 --> 00:35:45,320
All alliances and strategies
are allowed...

1126
00:35:45,320 --> 00:35:47,350
when violence isn't involved.

1127
00:35:47,350 --> 00:35:48,490
Sure thing.

1128
00:35:48,490 --> 00:35:50,510
But if I keep it on me,
the other team...

1129
00:35:50,510 --> 00:35:51,680
will steal the caramels.
This is driving me crazy.

1130
00:35:52,410 --> 00:35:54,030
I'll give back what I stole.

1131
00:35:54,760 --> 00:35:56,320
- Please enjoy.
- Keep it.

1132
00:35:56,320 --> 00:35:58,300
Sweet, isn't it?

1133
00:35:58,300 --> 00:35:59,760
- Do we get a minute?
- That's right.

1134
00:35:59,760 --> 00:36:01,930
Gosh, that is more than enough time.

1135
00:36:02,300 --> 00:36:03,300
All right.

1136
00:36:04,370 --> 00:36:06,430
- Your minute...
- Put the blindfold on properly.

1137
00:36:07,070 --> 00:36:08,160
(The 4 are only interested
in Kwang Soo.)

1138
00:36:08,160 --> 00:36:09,370
- Can we go ahead?
- Yes.

1139
00:36:10,570 --> 00:36:12,600
(Anxious)

1140
00:36:14,100 --> 00:36:15,700
(Their minute begins.)

1141
00:36:15,700 --> 00:36:16,870
- Are we on the clock?
- Yes.

1142
00:36:17,450 --> 00:36:19,010
(They immediately bind him.)

1143
00:36:19,220 --> 00:36:22,090
(Without even thinking,
they take Kwang Soo's hip sack.)

1144
00:36:24,350 --> 00:36:25,720
(What they hear paints the scene.)

1145
00:36:25,720 --> 00:36:27,930
- What's going on, Kwang Soo?
- Are you all right?

1146
00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:29,530
- Kwang Soo...
- Are you all right?

1147
00:36:29,530 --> 00:36:30,660
(It only took them 5 seconds
to steal his hip sack.)

1148
00:36:30,660 --> 00:36:32,100
I think they're busy
attacking Kwang Soo.

1149
00:36:32,760 --> 00:36:34,430
- There's nothing here.
- Where did he hide them?

1150
00:36:34,430 --> 00:36:36,260
(It's empty!)

1151
00:36:36,390 --> 00:36:38,970
(There are no caramels
inside Kwang Soo's hip sack.)

1152
00:36:38,970 --> 00:36:40,140
Where did he hide them?

1153
00:36:41,430 --> 00:36:42,870
(They immediately
search his pockets.)

1154
00:36:42,870 --> 00:36:44,780
- No!
- They'll take everything.

1155
00:36:44,930 --> 00:36:46,100
- No!
- They'll take everything.

1156
00:36:47,570 --> 00:36:49,780
Where on earth did he hide them?

1157
00:36:49,780 --> 00:36:52,550
- Did he hide them?
- How long do I have left?

1158
00:36:53,370 --> 00:36:55,220
- Where are they?
- How long do I have?

1159
00:36:55,550 --> 00:36:56,590
How many seconds do I have left?

1160
00:36:56,590 --> 00:36:57,720
- Where did he hide them?
- He hid them?

1161
00:36:57,720 --> 00:36:59,010
- Where are they?
- How long do I have?

1162
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:01,220
Kwang Soo never ceases to amaze me.

1163
00:37:01,220 --> 00:37:02,530
- No way.
- You have 20 seconds.

1164
00:37:02,530 --> 00:37:03,530
Unbelievable.

1165
00:37:03,530 --> 00:37:05,200
- Where did he hide them?
- And when?

1166
00:37:05,200 --> 00:37:06,430
(They quickly move on to the balls.)

1167
00:37:07,530 --> 00:37:09,700
Let's only leave two behind.

1168
00:37:09,700 --> 00:37:10,890
(Let's score as many as we can.)

1169
00:37:10,890 --> 00:37:13,160
Where did he hide them? Where?

1170
00:37:13,160 --> 00:37:15,240
(They leave all 10 balls!)

1171
00:37:15,240 --> 00:37:16,870
- Where did you hide them?
- Four.

1172
00:37:16,870 --> 00:37:20,030
- I think I saw them.
- 3, 2, 1.

1173
00:37:20,950 --> 00:37:22,910
(Their 1 minute is over.)

1174
00:37:23,820 --> 00:37:25,570
Wait. Where are his caramels?

1175
00:37:26,240 --> 00:37:27,390
Kwang Soo...

1176
00:37:27,390 --> 00:37:28,450
(Panting)

1177
00:37:28,510 --> 00:37:30,990
(If they succeed,
they'll win 10 points.)

1178
00:37:30,990 --> 00:37:33,490
(They can only blow the whistle
twice, so what will it be?)

1179
00:37:34,220 --> 00:37:35,990
(What?)

1180
00:37:36,350 --> 00:37:38,490
(He immediately blew
on the whistle.)

1181
00:37:39,530 --> 00:37:41,600
(What?)

1182
00:37:42,320 --> 00:37:44,970
- What happened?
- The game is over.

1183
00:37:44,970 --> 00:37:47,410
(Kwang Soo wins 10 points
for his team!)

1184
00:37:47,410 --> 00:37:50,030
- The game is over.
- Nice!

1185
00:37:50,030 --> 00:37:51,280
(Kwang Soo did it!)

1186
00:37:51,280 --> 00:37:53,370
- Kwang Soo!
- Nicely done.

1187
00:37:53,370 --> 00:37:55,470
- What happened?
- Nice.

1188
00:37:55,470 --> 00:37:57,970
- You're incredible, you know that?
- Just incredible.

1189
00:37:57,970 --> 00:37:59,180
- Kwang Soo!
- Where did you hide them?

1190
00:37:59,180 --> 00:38:01,910
- Where did you hide them?
- Where are the caramels?

1191
00:38:02,280 --> 00:38:03,320
And when?

1192
00:38:03,780 --> 00:38:05,890
(Are there caramels
near the cameraman's shoes?)

1193
00:38:05,890 --> 00:38:07,850
- And when?
- On the floor?

1194
00:38:08,090 --> 00:38:09,530
(When did he hide them there?)

1195
00:38:09,530 --> 00:38:10,620
- Over there?
- When?

1196
00:38:10,620 --> 00:38:11,660
When?

1197
00:38:11,660 --> 00:38:13,550
- Just when?
- So that's where they were.

1198
00:38:13,550 --> 00:38:14,760
- They're over here.
- When did he hide them?

1199
00:38:14,760 --> 00:38:16,720
When you were busy
playing the game.

1200
00:38:18,030 --> 00:38:20,910
(5 minutes into the game)

1201
00:38:22,160 --> 00:38:25,600
(After leaving a comment,
he went to hide the caramels.)

1202
00:38:25,930 --> 00:38:28,200
(Kwang Soo must've known...)

1203
00:38:28,200 --> 00:38:30,350
(that he'd be thoroughly searched.)

1204
00:38:31,240 --> 00:38:33,990
- Nice one, Kwang Soo.
- He's on a roll.

1205
00:38:34,850 --> 00:38:36,720
- See?
- He's on a roll.

1206
00:38:36,720 --> 00:38:37,780
Wasn't I right
to choose the cunning ones?

1207
00:38:37,780 --> 00:38:39,510
- The cunning ones.
- Nicely chosen.

1208
00:38:39,510 --> 00:38:41,030
Do you all have your caramels?

1209
00:38:41,030 --> 00:38:42,220
- Yes.
- Of course.

1210
00:38:42,590 --> 00:38:44,550
- He's our lucky charm.
- Exactly.

1211
00:38:44,550 --> 00:38:45,720
He brought all the luck.

1212
00:38:45,720 --> 00:38:47,760
There's still the second round.

1213
00:38:47,760 --> 00:38:49,820
This time, Haha will go first.

1214
00:38:50,930 --> 00:38:52,300
Let's play rock-paper-scissors.

1215
00:38:52,300 --> 00:38:53,910
- Just do it.
- No, play rock-paper-scissors.

1216
00:38:53,910 --> 00:38:55,530
- It's your turn.
- You're up.

1217
00:38:55,760 --> 00:38:57,030
- It's your turn.
- No, play rock-paper-scissors.

1218
00:38:57,030 --> 00:38:58,340
- It is.
- Play rock-paper-scissors.

1219
00:38:58,340 --> 00:38:59,800
- It's your turn.
- No, it's not.

1220
00:38:59,800 --> 00:39:01,200
- Play rock-paper-scissors.
- It's your turn.

1221
00:39:01,200 --> 00:39:02,680
No, I've been waiting for my turn.

1222
00:39:02,680 --> 00:39:04,510
We'd like it to be someone
with a lot of caramels.

1223
00:39:04,510 --> 00:39:06,280
- That's you.
- Hold on a second.

1224
00:39:06,280 --> 00:39:08,620
- Hold on. Just wait.
- Just go ahead.

1225
00:39:08,620 --> 00:39:10,450
Wait. No, let me go.

1226
00:39:10,450 --> 00:39:13,090
- Hey, we haven't even started yet.
- Not yet?

1227
00:39:14,450 --> 00:39:16,260
Gosh, you're annoying. Hold on.

1228
00:39:16,260 --> 00:39:17,430
(Thinking of his imminent future
only makes him laugh.)

1229
00:39:17,430 --> 00:39:18,450
Wait.

1230
00:39:18,450 --> 00:39:19,850
(What now?)

1231
00:39:19,850 --> 00:39:21,430
- I know.
- Isn't he scary?

1232
00:39:21,760 --> 00:39:24,760
(The caramel thief
already found his target.)

1233
00:39:24,840 --> 00:39:27,760
(Give me a caramel,
and I'll let you live.)

1234
00:39:27,760 --> 00:39:29,030
Hurry up.

1235
00:39:29,970 --> 00:39:32,030
Don't you want to steal it all?

1236
00:39:32,030 --> 00:39:34,070
(The juicy target
is making him lose it.)

1237
00:39:34,240 --> 00:39:36,640
- Hurry.
- Let's play.

1238
00:39:37,550 --> 00:39:38,820
How about this?

1239
00:39:39,280 --> 00:39:41,490
Give us one each,
and we won't take any more.

1240
00:39:41,910 --> 00:39:43,350
Give us one each,

1241
00:39:43,350 --> 00:39:44,550
- and we won't take any more.
- Good.

1242
00:39:44,550 --> 00:39:45,550
- That can be better.
- Give us one each.

1243
00:39:45,550 --> 00:39:47,010
- We'll call it a truce then.
- For real.

1244
00:39:47,010 --> 00:39:48,850
That could be better for you.

1245
00:39:49,160 --> 00:39:51,620
- Wait...
- It could be better.

1246
00:39:51,620 --> 00:39:53,320
- What do you think of my deal?
- I love it.

1247
00:39:53,320 --> 00:39:54,870
- It's the final round, anyway.
- We'll take it all.

1248
00:39:54,870 --> 00:39:56,370
- That would be better.
- Give us one each,

1249
00:39:56,370 --> 00:39:57,990
- and we won't take more.
- That's way better for you.

1250
00:39:57,990 --> 00:39:59,300
We have others to steal from anyway.

1251
00:39:59,300 --> 00:40:01,370
- We won't steal anymore.
- We swear.

1252
00:40:02,010 --> 00:40:03,370
Problems are better solved
with money.

1253
00:40:03,370 --> 00:40:04,370
That's right.

1254
00:40:04,970 --> 00:40:06,640
- All right.
- The choice is yours.

1255
00:40:06,640 --> 00:40:08,350
All right, I'll give them up.

1256
00:40:08,640 --> 00:40:10,100
- Thank you.
- Here.

1257
00:40:10,620 --> 00:40:12,720
Are you really handing them over?

1258
00:40:12,720 --> 00:40:15,120
- This is way better.
- Exactly. Give them away.

1259
00:40:15,120 --> 00:40:16,450
Did you really hand them over?

1260
00:40:17,240 --> 00:40:18,990
I got my caramels stolen...

1261
00:40:18,990 --> 00:40:20,680
- at the age of 42.
- No, don't be like that.

1262
00:40:20,720 --> 00:40:22,120
It's a logical solution.

1263
00:40:22,220 --> 00:40:24,030
It sets your heart at ease,
doesn't it?

1264
00:40:24,030 --> 00:40:26,120
We won't take your bag. Don't worry.

1265
00:40:26,120 --> 00:40:27,800
- Seriously.
- That's right.

1266
00:40:27,800 --> 00:40:29,430
- Hey.
- He is a coward.

1267
00:40:29,430 --> 00:40:30,700
You don't need to be scared.

1268
00:40:30,700 --> 00:40:32,570
- Take good care of me.
- One minute begins now.

1269
00:40:33,340 --> 00:40:35,300
Since he gave us a caramel,
we should treat him well.

1270
00:40:35,300 --> 00:40:36,370
That's right.
We should treat him well.

1271
00:40:36,370 --> 00:40:37,430
- We should treat him well.
- That's right.

1272
00:40:37,430 --> 00:40:39,240
- He gave us a caramel each.
- We need to set an example...

1273
00:40:39,240 --> 00:40:41,050
- so that the others will follow.
- That's right.

1274
00:40:41,050 --> 00:40:43,350
We want them to give us caramels
when we ask.

1275
00:40:43,350 --> 00:40:44,870
- Haha is the nicest.
- It was a good idea...

1276
00:40:44,870 --> 00:40:46,510
- to have the cunning members.
- He is the best.

1277
00:40:46,510 --> 00:40:48,280
- Seriously.
- I realized that...

1278
00:40:48,410 --> 00:40:50,120
the others would give up caramels
only if we set an example.

1279
00:40:50,120 --> 00:40:51,910
It's water.

1280
00:40:51,910 --> 00:40:53,890
(Go away.)

1281
00:40:54,220 --> 00:40:55,760
(Out of fear, Haha refuses
a moist act of kindness.)

1282
00:40:55,760 --> 00:40:57,090
You should drink water.

1283
00:40:57,320 --> 00:40:59,320
- It's water.
- It's water. Haha!

1284
00:40:59,320 --> 00:41:00,700
It's just water.

1285
00:41:00,700 --> 00:41:01,890
We are trying to be nice to you.

1286
00:41:01,890 --> 00:41:04,370
- Have a drink of water.
- We are trying to be nice to you.

1287
00:41:04,370 --> 00:41:06,430
- Drink.
- Drink.

1288
00:41:06,430 --> 00:41:07,640
Drink. I said, drink.

1289
00:41:07,740 --> 00:41:09,200
We aren't going to do anything.

1290
00:41:09,200 --> 00:41:10,570
Drink.

1291
00:41:10,680 --> 00:41:12,140
Why won't you drink?

1292
00:41:12,140 --> 00:41:14,700
It looks like you have a fugitive.

1293
00:41:15,350 --> 00:41:16,640
- No, no.
- Seriously.

1294
00:41:16,640 --> 00:41:17,640
All right. Okay.

1295
00:41:17,640 --> 00:41:20,370
Why is Haha sitting down
so pitifully?

1296
00:41:20,370 --> 00:41:21,390
We were just...

1297
00:41:21,390 --> 00:41:22,890
- Shall we stop with five balls?
- Okay.

1298
00:41:22,890 --> 00:41:24,180
(Their minute is over.)

1299
00:41:24,180 --> 00:41:25,510
- Shall we stop with five balls?
- Okay.

1300
00:41:25,510 --> 00:41:27,010
(There are 5 balls in the goal.
Will Haha blow the whistle?)

1301
00:41:27,010 --> 00:41:28,320
He might blow the whistle.

1302
00:41:28,320 --> 00:41:29,450
All right.

1303
00:41:29,450 --> 00:41:31,530
- Haha, make a choice.
- Why did you give me water?

1304
00:41:31,660 --> 00:41:32,950
- We wanted to be nice to you.
- We wanted you to drink it.

1305
00:41:32,950 --> 00:41:34,320
- We wanted to be nice to you.
- You wanted to be nice to me?

1306
00:41:34,320 --> 00:41:35,370
- That's right.
- You gave us a caramel each.

1307
00:41:35,370 --> 00:41:37,700
I was scared my team members
would take my caramels.

1308
00:41:37,700 --> 00:41:40,300
- Why would they do that?
- They are blindfolded.

1309
00:41:40,300 --> 00:41:41,760
I was really scared.

1310
00:41:41,760 --> 00:41:42,800
(Crying)

1311
00:41:42,800 --> 00:41:44,140
You gave them caramels in advance.

1312
00:41:44,140 --> 00:41:47,300
It seemed that way.
Make a decision with the whistle.

1313
00:41:48,240 --> 00:41:50,240
(Thanks to the good people,
Haha saved his caramels.)

1314
00:41:50,240 --> 00:41:51,370
(Will he be able to save the goal?)

1315
00:41:51,370 --> 00:41:52,450
One,

1316
00:41:52,720 --> 00:41:54,240
- two,
- What will it be?

1317
00:41:54,240 --> 00:41:55,320
three.

1318
00:41:56,990 --> 00:41:58,090
(Sighing)

1319
00:41:58,760 --> 00:41:59,890
I didn't blow it.

1320
00:42:00,160 --> 00:42:02,260
Team Offense won five points.

1321
00:42:02,260 --> 00:42:04,760
(Suk Jin Gang won 5 points!)

1322
00:42:05,660 --> 00:42:07,300
(They got us again.)

1323
00:42:07,300 --> 00:42:09,030
- For goodness' sake.
- You should have blown the whistle.

1324
00:42:09,120 --> 00:42:10,620
You should have blown it.

1325
00:42:10,620 --> 00:42:12,800
- How was I supposed to know?
- We are on a roll.

1326
00:42:12,800 --> 00:42:14,300
How was I supposed to know?

1327
00:42:14,300 --> 00:42:15,760
We are a good team.

1328
00:42:15,760 --> 00:42:17,410
- We have the best teamwork.
- I know.

1329
00:42:18,930 --> 00:42:20,740
All right.
Blow the whistle this time.

1330
00:42:20,740 --> 00:42:21,850
Let's go.

1331
00:42:22,100 --> 00:42:23,700
(Glancing over)

1332
00:42:24,240 --> 00:42:25,470
- But to do this...
- Hold on.

1333
00:42:25,470 --> 00:42:26,780
Jae Suk, you are so upsetting.

1334
00:42:26,850 --> 00:42:28,890
Why did you look at me
as you said "Let's go"?

1335
00:42:28,890 --> 00:42:30,550
- Let's play rock-paper-scissors.
- Let's play rock-paper-scissors.

1336
00:42:30,680 --> 00:42:32,120
- Rock-paper-scissors.
- Rock-paper-scissors.

1337
00:42:32,410 --> 00:42:34,530
(Jae Suk is chosen to enter
the lion's den!)

1338
00:42:34,530 --> 00:42:35,530
Okay!

1339
00:42:36,350 --> 00:42:37,820
(The caramel-hungry beasts
are scarier than losing.)

1340
00:42:37,820 --> 00:42:39,430
This is the best.

1341
00:42:40,050 --> 00:42:41,660
It's a cause for celebration.

1342
00:42:41,660 --> 00:42:43,070
I need to go somewhere for a second.

1343
00:42:43,070 --> 00:42:44,070
- Where are you going?
- I will be back.

1344
00:42:44,070 --> 00:42:45,660
- Will you hide your caramels?
- Jae Suk,

1345
00:42:45,660 --> 00:42:47,430
- you don't need to give us any.
- Hang on.

1346
00:42:47,430 --> 00:42:50,300
- It will be a treasure hunt.
- Just give us four caramels.

1347
00:42:50,800 --> 00:42:52,300
You will end up
getting everything stolen.

1348
00:42:52,300 --> 00:42:55,550
I don't have many caramels.
I only have nine now. Hold on.

1349
00:42:56,070 --> 00:42:57,240
I will keep them here for a second.

1350
00:42:57,240 --> 00:42:59,680
(He hides the caramels
inside the filming equipment bag.)

1351
00:42:59,680 --> 00:43:00,890
I will retrieve them later.

1352
00:43:01,820 --> 00:43:02,850
Gosh, that hurts.

1353
00:43:02,850 --> 00:43:03,850
(They won't be able to find them.)

1354
00:43:03,850 --> 00:43:06,050
Just give us four caramels.
and set your heart at ease.

1355
00:43:06,050 --> 00:43:07,050
No!

1356
00:43:07,050 --> 00:43:08,120
- No?
- No.

1357
00:43:08,220 --> 00:43:10,220
- You will get everything stolen.
- Also,

1358
00:43:10,220 --> 00:43:12,890
I will hit you if you come near me.

1359
00:43:13,700 --> 00:43:15,930
- Keep that in mind.
- Then Jong Kook should go in alone.

1360
00:43:16,530 --> 00:43:17,530
- Okay.
- That's right.

1361
00:43:17,530 --> 00:43:19,800
- Good luck. Blow the whistle.
- Okay.

1362
00:43:19,800 --> 00:43:22,970
All right. Jae Suk. Music, cue.

1363
00:43:22,970 --> 00:43:25,600
(Since he hid the caramels,
he plays the game with ease.)

1364
00:43:25,600 --> 00:43:26,870
(What?)

1365
00:43:27,140 --> 00:43:28,300
Where are they going?

1366
00:43:28,300 --> 00:43:29,410
(Where are his teammates going?)

1367
00:43:29,410 --> 00:43:32,140
(Jae Suk's 3 subordinates are
off to look for his caramels!)

1368
00:43:32,140 --> 00:43:33,780
- Where are they going?
- They will look for his caramels.

1369
00:43:33,780 --> 00:43:35,050
(Aren't they on the same team?)

1370
00:43:35,050 --> 00:43:36,510
His teammates
will look for his caramels.

1371
00:43:36,780 --> 00:43:38,160
- Where are they?
- Where did he hide them?

1372
00:43:38,160 --> 00:43:39,390
- Where did he hide them?
- Tell us.

1373
00:43:39,390 --> 00:43:40,820
- Where are they? Tell us.
- Hurry up.

1374
00:43:41,120 --> 00:43:42,430
- Where are they?
- Where are they?

1375
00:43:42,430 --> 00:43:43,430
(Let's find and steal them!)

1376
00:43:44,350 --> 00:43:46,350
(Meanwhile)

1377
00:43:47,120 --> 00:43:48,430
- Does he have them?
- No.

1378
00:43:48,430 --> 00:43:49,470
(They check if he has
any leftover caramels.)

1379
00:43:49,470 --> 00:43:50,760
- He doesn't have them.
- They must be in there.

1380
00:43:51,140 --> 00:43:53,760
They must be in his pocket.

1381
00:43:55,200 --> 00:43:56,640
(Hitting)

1382
00:43:57,600 --> 00:43:59,740
(His vicious front teeth
attack the thief.)

1383
00:44:00,510 --> 00:44:02,570
(I told you
that I won't let you be.)

1384
00:44:02,870 --> 00:44:04,320
I won't do it!

1385
00:44:04,320 --> 00:44:05,320
(Amidst the chaos,)

1386
00:44:05,320 --> 00:44:07,990
(So Min gets to work.)

1387
00:44:07,990 --> 00:44:09,780
I won't do it! Hey!

1388
00:44:09,780 --> 00:44:10,820
(So Min uses this opportunity
to betray him!)

1389
00:44:10,820 --> 00:44:12,550
His bag is unguarded.

1390
00:44:12,850 --> 00:44:14,780
Hey! Let go!

1391
00:44:14,780 --> 00:44:16,280
(The chairman goes after So Min.)

1392
00:44:16,280 --> 00:44:17,350
Let go!

1393
00:44:17,350 --> 00:44:19,220
(The thug goes after the chairman!)

1394
00:44:19,220 --> 00:44:21,100
(It's a complete mess!)

1395
00:44:22,300 --> 00:44:25,760
(The caramel food chain)

1396
00:44:25,760 --> 00:44:27,600
(The chemistry they built up
over 10 years shine...)

1397
00:44:27,600 --> 00:44:29,410
(before the caramels.)

1398
00:44:29,410 --> 00:44:30,600
Oh, no. My caramels.

1399
00:44:30,600 --> 00:44:33,740
(There is another place
where their chemistry shines.)

1400
00:44:33,740 --> 00:44:35,180
Let's share them.

1401
00:44:35,180 --> 00:44:37,570
Let's take two each.

1402
00:44:37,570 --> 00:44:38,850
2 for you and 2 for me.

1403
00:44:39,510 --> 00:44:41,620
(The fellowship of the slush fund
returns with the caramels.)

1404
00:44:41,620 --> 00:44:42,740
I feel bad for him.

1405
00:44:43,410 --> 00:44:44,450
Oh, no. My caramels.

1406
00:44:44,450 --> 00:44:46,990
(He has no idea what has happened.)

1407
00:44:48,180 --> 00:44:49,180
10 seconds left.

1408
00:44:49,180 --> 00:44:51,490
(Stealthy)

1409
00:44:51,490 --> 00:44:52,820
- Five,
- That was close.

1410
00:44:52,820 --> 00:44:53,820
four,

1411
00:44:53,820 --> 00:44:54,890
three,

1412
00:44:54,970 --> 00:44:55,970
two,

1413
00:44:55,970 --> 00:44:57,070
one.

1414
00:44:57,070 --> 00:44:58,340
Turn off the music.

1415
00:44:58,640 --> 00:45:00,740
(Will Jae Suk blow the whistle?)

1416
00:45:00,740 --> 00:45:01,760
- Go ahead.
- Let's see.

1417
00:45:01,760 --> 00:45:02,870
I will count to three.

1418
00:45:03,600 --> 00:45:04,870
Did he blow the whistle?

1419
00:45:04,870 --> 00:45:06,340
(He blew the whistle!)

1420
00:45:06,340 --> 00:45:07,740
- Okay.
- He blew the whistle.

1421
00:45:07,740 --> 00:45:09,510
Team Defense won five points.

1422
00:45:09,850 --> 00:45:11,220
- It's okay.
- Nice.

1423
00:45:11,220 --> 00:45:12,470
- There we go.
- They need those points.

1424
00:45:12,470 --> 00:45:13,910
- There we go.
- Jae Suk.

1425
00:45:13,910 --> 00:45:14,950
- All right.
- There we go.

1426
00:45:14,950 --> 00:45:17,390
- We gave them those points.
- That's right.

1427
00:45:17,660 --> 00:45:20,220
Thus, the second round
came to an end.

1428
00:45:20,390 --> 00:45:22,850
Suk Jin Gang won 31 caramels each.

1429
00:45:22,850 --> 00:45:24,090
(Suk Jin Gang won
31 caramels each.)

1430
00:45:24,090 --> 00:45:26,160
- That's a lot.
- That worked.

1431
00:45:26,160 --> 00:45:27,200
(Their investment paid off.)

1432
00:45:27,200 --> 00:45:28,870
Jae Suk Gang won
nine caramels each.

1433
00:45:28,870 --> 00:45:30,030
- 9 caramels?
- 9 caramels?

1434
00:45:30,030 --> 00:45:31,160
(Jae Suk Gang won 9 caramels each.)

1435
00:45:31,160 --> 00:45:32,840
We will distribute the caramels now.

1436
00:45:32,840 --> 00:45:35,430
Count how many caramels
you currently have.

1437
00:45:35,430 --> 00:45:37,260
I got three caramels taken away.

1438
00:45:37,260 --> 00:45:39,180
I only have nine caramels now.

1439
00:45:39,180 --> 00:45:40,200
When did you get them taken away?

1440
00:45:40,200 --> 00:45:41,870
(Will that really be the case?)

1441
00:45:42,640 --> 00:45:43,950
They took my caramels!

1442
00:45:43,950 --> 00:45:45,010
(My slush fund)

1443
00:45:45,010 --> 00:45:47,570
(They got me.)

1444
00:45:48,410 --> 00:45:50,390
You took all of my caramels!

1445
00:45:50,590 --> 00:45:52,120
You took all of my caramels!

1446
00:45:52,120 --> 00:45:53,120
I have 14 caramels.

1447
00:45:53,120 --> 00:45:54,390
Did someone take your caramels?

1448
00:45:54,390 --> 00:45:55,590
(Feigning innocence)

1449
00:45:55,590 --> 00:45:56,850
- Did someone take your caramels?
- They took everything.

1450
00:45:56,850 --> 00:45:58,490
Your teammates took them.

1451
00:45:58,490 --> 00:45:59,930
- They took everything.
- What are you talking about?

1452
00:45:59,930 --> 00:46:00,990
(He reports the incident.)

1453
00:46:00,990 --> 00:46:02,070
They did it.

1454
00:46:02,070 --> 00:46:03,470
Did they get stolen
while you were wearing a blindfold?

1455
00:46:03,570 --> 00:46:05,260
- Check the amount.
- Was it you?

1456
00:46:05,260 --> 00:46:06,470
- Was it you?
- Me?

1457
00:46:06,800 --> 00:46:07,910
(He feigns disbelief.)

1458
00:46:07,910 --> 00:46:10,010
- Me? I was...
- Was it you?

1459
00:46:11,240 --> 00:46:12,340
Ji Hyo, what are those?

1460
00:46:12,570 --> 00:46:13,970
- Hold on.
- Ji Hyo, what are those?

1461
00:46:13,970 --> 00:46:15,470
(Her hands are full of caramels.)

1462
00:46:15,470 --> 00:46:17,280
Ji Hyo, aren't those mine?

1463
00:46:17,280 --> 00:46:19,550
- Of course not, Jae Suk.
- Ji Hyo.

1464
00:46:19,620 --> 00:46:21,350
Ji Hyo, it makes no sense
for you to have...

1465
00:46:21,350 --> 00:46:22,410
- so many.
- Come on, Jae Suk.

1466
00:46:22,410 --> 00:46:24,240
It's like a caramel factory.

1467
00:46:24,240 --> 00:46:25,590
I won them earlier.

1468
00:46:25,680 --> 00:46:27,450
Is theft allowed?

1469
00:46:28,220 --> 00:46:29,820
- Is it?
- You did it...

1470
00:46:29,820 --> 00:46:32,350
- before anyone else did.
- Anything but violence is allowed.

1471
00:46:32,350 --> 00:46:35,160
Okay. I won't forget this.

1472
00:46:35,390 --> 00:46:37,570
I won't forget this. It's a war.

1473
00:46:37,570 --> 00:46:38,760
(Current Number of Caramels,
Jong Kook 53, Suk Jin 45,)

1474
00:46:38,760 --> 00:46:39,930
(So Min 44, Kwang Soo 44,
Se Chan 31, Haha 27)

1475
00:46:39,930 --> 00:46:40,930
(Ji Hyo 25, Jae Suk 9)

1476
00:46:40,930 --> 00:46:42,840
- Everyone.
- Yes?

1477
00:46:42,840 --> 00:46:45,430
We will have the second election
for the chairman.

1478
00:46:45,430 --> 00:46:46,780
- The election.
- The time has come.

1479
00:46:46,970 --> 00:46:49,100
The process will remain the same.

1480
00:46:49,100 --> 00:46:52,180
The vote will take place
after 10 minutes of campaigning.

1481
00:46:52,180 --> 00:46:54,890
Someone with a lot of caramels
will have a high chance.

1482
00:46:54,890 --> 00:46:57,090
- That's right.
- You can buy people with caramels.

1483
00:46:57,220 --> 00:46:58,510
Se Chan, I will support you.

1484
00:46:58,780 --> 00:46:59,850
Run for the chairman.

1485
00:46:59,850 --> 00:47:01,850
The candidates
will be given bills, right?

1486
00:47:01,850 --> 00:47:03,950
I think Se Chan wants...

1487
00:47:04,430 --> 00:47:05,620
- Are you running?
- Yes.

1488
00:47:05,620 --> 00:47:08,820
If I become the chairman,
I will give bills to three people.

1489
00:47:08,820 --> 00:47:10,300
- Really?
- Me.

1490
00:47:10,300 --> 00:47:11,660
- 9 bills to 3 people.
- Me.

1491
00:47:11,660 --> 00:47:12,840
(He will give 9 bills
to 3 people each.)

1492
00:47:12,840 --> 00:47:14,800
- I held my hand up 1st.
- Jong Kook, you are 1st.

1493
00:47:14,800 --> 00:47:17,030
- Me.
- I will give nine bills...

1494
00:47:17,030 --> 00:47:18,410
- each.
- Okay.

1495
00:47:18,410 --> 00:47:20,470
Se Chan, I will support you.

1496
00:47:20,640 --> 00:47:23,300
- Just give me seven bills.
- Oh, okay.

1497
00:47:30,340 --> 00:47:33,170
- Kwang Soo.
- I will run.

1498
00:47:33,570 --> 00:47:35,520
- Will you run?
- Yes, I will run.

1499
00:47:35,520 --> 00:47:37,050
- Do you need my support?
- I support you.

1500
00:47:37,050 --> 00:47:38,480
- Support me.
- Okay.

1501
00:47:38,480 --> 00:47:40,210
- I will support...
- Go over there.

1502
00:47:40,380 --> 00:47:42,190
- Kwang Soo, come here.
- I will support you.

1503
00:47:42,190 --> 00:47:43,480
Me too. I will support you.

1504
00:47:43,480 --> 00:47:45,380
- The one we support should win.
- That's right.

1505
00:47:45,380 --> 00:47:47,130
- I will support you.
- Seriously.

1506
00:47:47,130 --> 00:47:48,860
- I swear.
- Promise...

1507
00:47:48,860 --> 00:47:50,650
to divide the 30 bills among us.

1508
00:47:50,650 --> 00:47:52,820
- I will divide them equally.
- 7, 7, 8, 8.

1509
00:47:52,820 --> 00:47:55,590
- 7, 7, 8, 8.
- Okay.

1510
00:47:55,590 --> 00:47:58,210
Let's give five bills
to anyone who betrays Se Chan.

1511
00:47:58,460 --> 00:48:00,730
I will give five bills
to anyone who betrays Se Chan.

1512
00:48:01,110 --> 00:48:03,000
What? How many bills?

1513
00:48:03,710 --> 00:48:04,780
Five bills.

1514
00:48:04,780 --> 00:48:06,110
(Kwang Soo's body reacts
to the talk of betrayal.)

1515
00:48:06,110 --> 00:48:08,280
- Kwang Soo.
- Will I get paid now or later?

1516
00:48:08,280 --> 00:48:10,980
I will give five bills
to anyone who betrays Se Chan.

1517
00:48:10,980 --> 00:48:13,050
It's only 5 bills.
I will give you 7 bills.

1518
00:48:13,050 --> 00:48:16,090
Listen. That group has
So Min and Kwang Soo.

1519
00:48:16,090 --> 00:48:17,820
We will stick together
and vote for Jae Suk.

1520
00:48:17,820 --> 00:48:19,590
- You will get caramels too.
- That's right.

1521
00:48:19,750 --> 00:48:21,460
- You won't be able to win there.
- You will get five bills...

1522
00:48:21,460 --> 00:48:22,920
and caramels.

1523
00:48:22,920 --> 00:48:24,900
How many bills
did you promise to give them?

1524
00:48:24,900 --> 00:48:26,320
- Seven bills each.
- That's right.

1525
00:48:26,320 --> 00:48:28,360
I will give you two caramels each.

1526
00:48:28,360 --> 00:48:30,270
- Then you will have 9 caramels.
- 9 caramels.

1527
00:48:30,270 --> 00:48:31,800
In that case, give them to me now.

1528
00:48:31,800 --> 00:48:33,030
- What?
- Give them to me now.

1529
00:48:33,030 --> 00:48:34,380
- I can't do that.
- He will pay after the election.

1530
00:48:34,380 --> 00:48:35,980
Go over there then.
Get five caramels.

1531
00:48:36,280 --> 00:48:37,840
- I don't care.
- If you come, I will pay up.

1532
00:48:38,610 --> 00:48:39,750
If you come, I will pay up.

1533
00:48:39,750 --> 00:48:42,550
- The bills will be divided equally.
- The bills will be divided equally.

1534
00:48:42,550 --> 00:48:43,840
- Listen.
- If they divide them equally...

1535
00:48:43,840 --> 00:48:45,750
- If you stay here,
- Then I will get nine caramels.

1536
00:48:45,750 --> 00:48:46,750
- you will get 9 caramels.
- 9 caramels.

1537
00:48:46,750 --> 00:48:47,750
You will get nine caramels.

1538
00:48:47,750 --> 00:48:50,090
- Why would you settle for five?
- I am not leaving.

1539
00:48:50,090 --> 00:48:51,190
- That's right.
- Don't do that.

1540
00:48:51,190 --> 00:48:52,360
I will give you
two additional caramels.

1541
00:48:52,360 --> 00:48:53,550
(They aren't falling for it.)

1542
00:48:53,780 --> 00:48:55,420
How many caramels
will you give them?

1543
00:48:55,420 --> 00:48:57,530
Give them 10 caramels.
It's better to be the chairman.

1544
00:48:57,530 --> 00:48:58,960
- It's a necessary sacrifice.
- That's right.

1545
00:48:58,960 --> 00:49:01,940
All right. Those who come
will receive 10 caramels.

1546
00:49:02,630 --> 00:49:03,630
(10 caramels?)

1547
00:49:03,630 --> 00:49:04,940
- 10 caramels?
- 10 caramels.

1548
00:49:04,940 --> 00:49:06,030
- 10 caramels?
- We will give 10 caramels.

1549
00:49:06,030 --> 00:49:07,840
- Then you should go.
- Go.

1550
00:49:07,840 --> 00:49:08,880
Go.

1551
00:49:08,880 --> 00:49:09,880
Should I go right now?

1552
00:49:09,880 --> 00:49:11,340
- We just need one.
- Should I betray Se Chan later?

1553
00:49:11,340 --> 00:49:12,480
(Should I betray Se Chan later?)

1554
00:49:12,480 --> 00:49:13,880
(Is betrayal the key?)

1555
00:49:13,880 --> 00:49:15,750
- Betray him.
- Right now?

1556
00:49:15,750 --> 00:49:16,980
- Betray him.
- Okay.

1557
00:49:16,980 --> 00:49:18,650
- Betray him.
- Okay. Let's have a vote.

1558
00:49:18,650 --> 00:49:20,050
In that case... Listen.

1559
00:49:20,050 --> 00:49:21,610
- How many bills? Seven?
- A lot.

1560
00:49:21,780 --> 00:49:23,590
All right. Don't come right away.

1561
00:49:23,590 --> 00:49:25,230
Betray him later, okay?

1562
00:49:25,230 --> 00:49:26,650
- Go.
- We just need one.

1563
00:49:26,650 --> 00:49:27,690
No, no.

1564
00:49:27,690 --> 00:49:28,730
Give us the bills.

1565
00:49:28,730 --> 00:49:29,730
I will do that.

1566
00:49:29,730 --> 00:49:31,530
Once we exchange them for caramels,

1567
00:49:31,530 --> 00:49:33,530
we will give the reward
to the turncoats.

1568
00:49:33,530 --> 00:49:35,500
- That's right.
- We will have a vote in 10 minutes.

1569
00:49:35,590 --> 00:49:37,800
I am not afraid
of what comes tomorrow.

1570
00:49:38,800 --> 00:49:40,610
We will have a vote in 10 minutes.

1571
00:49:40,610 --> 00:49:41,630
(The campaigning begins.)

1572
00:49:41,900 --> 00:49:44,780
Kwang Soo, come to the warm country.

1573
00:49:45,400 --> 00:49:48,320
We will give you money
so that you can settle down.

1574
00:49:48,520 --> 00:49:50,550
(What will be Kwang Soo's choice?)

1575
00:49:50,550 --> 00:49:52,050
Haha, can we talk for a second?

1576
00:49:52,480 --> 00:49:54,250
What do you want to talk about?

1577
00:49:54,460 --> 00:49:55,880
- What is this about?
- I just want to talk about...

1578
00:49:55,880 --> 00:49:57,360
- some business plans.
- Okay.

1579
00:49:58,630 --> 00:50:02,150
If Kwang Soo betrays me,

1580
00:50:02,150 --> 00:50:03,750
how many caramels can you take
in total?

1581
00:50:04,150 --> 00:50:05,730
I received seven bills.

1582
00:50:05,820 --> 00:50:06,920
I will give you eight caramels.

1583
00:50:07,860 --> 00:50:09,090
If you betray Jae Suk,
I will give you eight caramels.

1584
00:50:09,090 --> 00:50:10,940
(Candidate Yang makes
a secretive offer.)

1585
00:50:11,670 --> 00:50:12,840
I understand.

1586
00:50:12,840 --> 00:50:16,400
If I become the chairman,
I will give you a special benefit.

1587
00:50:16,400 --> 00:50:17,750
Okay.

1588
00:50:18,150 --> 00:50:19,880
- What benefit?
- Look at the big picture.

1589
00:50:19,880 --> 00:50:22,340
Se Chan has a higher chance
of getting betrayed.

1590
00:50:22,340 --> 00:50:23,550
That's true.

1591
00:50:23,550 --> 00:50:25,610
Even if he wins,

1592
00:50:25,750 --> 00:50:28,050
he has a lot of people
to look after including Jong Kook.

1593
00:50:28,050 --> 00:50:29,210
- I don't.
- That's certainly the case.

1594
00:50:29,210 --> 00:50:30,860
That's right. If you think about it,

1595
00:50:30,860 --> 00:50:32,530
- this is where our roots are.
- That's right.

1596
00:50:32,530 --> 00:50:33,530
That's a given.

1597
00:50:33,550 --> 00:50:34,750
(What will be their decision?)

1598
00:50:34,900 --> 00:50:36,190
- My goodness.
- You are here.

1599
00:50:36,190 --> 00:50:37,590
Candidate Yu, you are here.

1600
00:50:37,590 --> 00:50:39,860
- Candidate Yu.
- Well, let's play fair.

1601
00:50:39,860 --> 00:50:41,860
Okay. You have some nice members.

1602
00:50:41,860 --> 00:50:43,030
Okay.

1603
00:50:43,030 --> 00:50:44,230
Please vote honestly.

1604
00:50:44,230 --> 00:50:45,860
Let's keep the process clean.

1605
00:50:45,860 --> 00:50:47,130
- All right.
- All right.

1606
00:50:47,130 --> 00:50:49,480
I am sorry, but what does it mean
to vote honestly?

1607
00:50:49,800 --> 00:50:51,050
It just means
that we should stay honest.

1608
00:50:51,050 --> 00:50:53,050
- Honest?
- That's right. Don't betray.

1609
00:50:53,050 --> 00:50:55,840
Haha, you kept your distance.

1610
00:50:55,980 --> 00:50:57,750
- What?
- Did you change your mind?

1611
00:50:58,050 --> 00:50:59,690
It is a complex situation.

1612
00:50:59,710 --> 00:51:01,210
Didn't you write the name yet?

1613
00:51:01,210 --> 00:51:02,320
No, I didn't.

1614
00:51:02,780 --> 00:51:03,960
I didn't write the name yet.

1615
00:51:03,980 --> 00:51:05,030
Really?

1616
00:51:05,250 --> 00:51:07,460
Why aren't you inserting
the ballots?

1617
00:51:07,460 --> 00:51:08,730
- I did.
- He did.

1618
00:51:08,730 --> 00:51:10,030
These are bills.

1619
00:51:10,730 --> 00:51:12,070
You received bills from both sides.

1620
00:51:12,070 --> 00:51:13,090
Yes.

1621
00:51:13,300 --> 00:51:14,460
(Brazen)

1622
00:51:14,460 --> 00:51:15,460
Did you receive bills?

1623
00:51:15,460 --> 00:51:18,500
One candidate's bills
will become trash.

1624
00:51:18,940 --> 00:51:20,530
- You got bills from both sides?
- You got bills from both sides?

1625
00:51:20,530 --> 00:51:23,340
Haha could have voted for Se Chan.
It looks like he received a lot.

1626
00:51:23,340 --> 00:51:24,840
I can't believe him.

1627
00:51:24,840 --> 00:51:26,300
Se Chan gave him some bills.

1628
00:51:26,300 --> 00:51:27,610
(Nervous)

1629
00:51:28,020 --> 00:51:30,440
It has been a while
since you painted the big picture.

1630
00:51:30,440 --> 00:51:32,750
Yes. This is the picture I wanted.

1631
00:51:32,750 --> 00:51:34,590
All right. My ballots are in.

1632
00:51:34,590 --> 00:51:37,860
The former chairman
will count the ballots.

1633
00:51:37,860 --> 00:51:39,250
- Okay.
- Please count them well.

1634
00:51:39,250 --> 00:51:41,460
It's sad to see him step down.

1635
00:51:41,460 --> 00:51:43,630
You painted the big picture.

1636
00:51:43,750 --> 00:51:44,770
Gosh, this is...

1637
00:51:44,770 --> 00:51:46,190
I have no idea what will happen.

1638
00:51:46,190 --> 00:51:47,230
There is no way of knowing.

1639
00:51:47,230 --> 00:51:49,730
Se Chan, you are dressed
like a chairman today.

1640
00:51:49,730 --> 00:51:51,710
My outfit gives off that vibe.

1641
00:51:51,710 --> 00:51:52,940
(He looks like the new rich
at a realtor's office.)

1642
00:51:52,940 --> 00:51:54,170
I will count the ballots.

1643
00:51:54,210 --> 00:51:56,110
- Gosh, this is...
- Yoo Jae Suk.

1644
00:51:56,570 --> 00:51:57,630
Thank you.

1645
00:51:57,630 --> 00:51:59,150
(Yoo Jae Suk got one vote.)

1646
00:51:59,150 --> 00:52:01,110
- Yang Se Chan.
- Thank you.

1647
00:52:01,110 --> 00:52:02,750
(Yang Se Chan got one vote.)

1648
00:52:02,750 --> 00:52:04,550
- Yoo Jae Suk.
- Thank you.

1649
00:52:04,820 --> 00:52:05,880
This is neck-and-neck.

1650
00:52:05,880 --> 00:52:07,550
- Yang Se Chan.
- Okay.

1651
00:52:07,710 --> 00:52:09,090
(It's neck-and-neck
in the beginning.)

1652
00:52:09,090 --> 00:52:10,650
- Jae Suk...
- Yoo Jae Suk.

1653
00:52:10,650 --> 00:52:12,360
- All right.
- He is leading.

1654
00:52:12,360 --> 00:52:13,750
(Yoo Jae Suk got three votes.)

1655
00:52:13,750 --> 00:52:15,650
- Yoo Jae Suk.
- My goodness.

1656
00:52:16,400 --> 00:52:18,400
Gosh, this is...

1657
00:52:18,860 --> 00:52:20,270
Yoo Jae Suk.

1658
00:52:20,770 --> 00:52:22,570
This person was torn.

1659
00:52:23,190 --> 00:52:25,800
This person was torn.
Oh, it's Kwang Soo's ballot.

1660
00:52:26,340 --> 00:52:27,730
"It's Kwang Soo's ballot"?

1661
00:52:27,800 --> 00:52:29,170
Yoo Jae Suk.

1662
00:52:29,710 --> 00:52:31,110
Kwang Soo was torn.

1663
00:52:31,110 --> 00:52:34,710
Yoo Jae Suk! Yoo Jae Suk!

1664
00:52:34,780 --> 00:52:36,710
(Yoo Jae Suk got 6 votes,
and Yang Se Chan got 2 votes.)

1665
00:52:36,710 --> 00:52:38,420
- Yoo Jae Suk.
- Gosh, what is this?

1666
00:52:38,610 --> 00:52:40,320
- It's for Yoo Jae Suk, right?
- Yes, it is.

1667
00:52:40,320 --> 00:52:41,650
Whose ballot is this?

1668
00:52:41,650 --> 00:52:43,590
- Haha's.
- Haha's?

1669
00:52:43,590 --> 00:52:45,230
(Haha, how could you do this to me?)

1670
00:52:45,480 --> 00:52:47,800
- Yoo Jae Suk.
- Yoo Jae Suk!

1671
00:52:48,050 --> 00:52:49,920
- Yoo Jae Suk!
- Yoo Jae Suk!

1672
00:52:50,050 --> 00:52:51,860
Yoo Jae Suk, Yoo Jae Suk,
and Yoo Jae Suk.

1673
00:52:51,860 --> 00:52:53,630
(He gets consecutive ballots
at the end.)

1674
00:52:53,630 --> 00:52:54,730
Yoo Jae Suk!

1675
00:52:54,730 --> 00:52:56,730
- Yoo Jae Suk!
- Yoo Jae Suk!

1676
00:52:56,840 --> 00:52:57,940
Yoo Jae Suk!

1677
00:52:57,940 --> 00:52:59,960
- You are the worst!
- Yoo Jae Suk!

1678
00:52:59,960 --> 00:53:01,710
- Thank you.
- Yoo Jae Suk!

1679
00:53:01,710 --> 00:53:03,840
- Yoo Jae Suk!
- Thank you.

1680
00:53:04,440 --> 00:53:05,750
Firstly...

1681
00:53:05,750 --> 00:53:07,250
- You dirty punk!
- You know,

1682
00:53:07,250 --> 00:53:08,940
no one voted for Se Chan.

1683
00:53:08,940 --> 00:53:10,710
- Jong Kook did.
- I did.

1684
00:53:10,710 --> 00:53:12,150
You dirty punk!

1685
00:53:12,150 --> 00:53:13,150
Everyone switched sides.

1686
00:53:13,150 --> 00:53:14,550
- Firstly...
- You dirty punk!

1687
00:53:14,550 --> 00:53:16,420
(So Min approaches the chairman.)

1688
00:53:16,420 --> 00:53:17,860
(My goodness.)

1689
00:53:17,980 --> 00:53:19,130
- I did.
- So Min.

1690
00:53:19,130 --> 00:53:21,250
(She cast 2 ballots to Jae Suk.)

1691
00:53:21,690 --> 00:53:24,570
We will change Jae Suk's bills
to caramels.

1692
00:53:24,570 --> 00:53:26,820
Like I told you before...

1693
00:53:26,820 --> 00:53:28,670
- So Min.
- Will you have any bills left?

1694
00:53:28,670 --> 00:53:30,770
Not really.

1695
00:53:30,770 --> 00:53:32,610
- But I promised.
- You are in a good mood.

1696
00:53:32,610 --> 00:53:33,710
How many bills do you have left?

1697
00:53:33,710 --> 00:53:35,730
I will give you two bills each.

1698
00:53:35,730 --> 00:53:37,400
- All right.
- Two bills?

1699
00:53:37,670 --> 00:53:39,440
- What?
- How many bills do I have?

1700
00:53:39,440 --> 00:53:41,820
- 2 bills?
- I need 5 bills for myself.

1701
00:53:42,650 --> 00:53:43,750
(He is 3 seconds away
from swearing.)

1702
00:53:43,750 --> 00:53:44,840
That's incredible.

1703
00:53:44,840 --> 00:53:46,590
You need five bills for yourself?
That's not what you promised.

1704
00:53:46,590 --> 00:53:47,860
Don't you want the bills?

1705
00:53:47,860 --> 00:53:48,960
You said there will be a benefit.

1706
00:53:48,960 --> 00:53:50,860
You said you will give me 11 bills
if I betray Se Chan.

1707
00:53:51,420 --> 00:53:52,860
- When did I...
- Where are my nine bills?

1708
00:53:52,860 --> 00:53:54,460
When did I say
I will give you 11 bills?

1709
00:53:54,460 --> 00:53:55,860
- See?
- Give me the bills then.

1710
00:53:55,860 --> 00:53:57,000
It's not like that.

1711
00:53:57,000 --> 00:53:58,420
For goodness' sake.

1712
00:53:58,420 --> 00:53:59,420
We betrayed Se Chan.

1713
00:53:59,420 --> 00:54:01,730
- You promised me 11 bills.
- Take 2 bills for now.

1714
00:54:01,730 --> 00:54:02,770
Take two bills for now.

1715
00:54:02,770 --> 00:54:04,460
Kwang Soo and So Min,
you would have gotten 11 bills...

1716
00:54:04,460 --> 00:54:06,730
- had you stayed.
- You would have gotten 11 bills.

1717
00:54:06,860 --> 00:54:08,000
So Min, how many bills did you get?

1718
00:54:08,440 --> 00:54:09,840
- Two bills?
- Listen.

1719
00:54:09,840 --> 00:54:11,210
Did you get two bills?

1720
00:54:11,610 --> 00:54:13,400
So Min got two bills.

1721
00:54:13,400 --> 00:54:16,380
I knew Jae Suk didn't have
enough bills.

1722
00:54:16,420 --> 00:54:18,340
- How many bills do you have?
- 1, 2, 3...

1723
00:54:18,340 --> 00:54:20,150
Hold on. This isn't Jae Suk's bill.
It should be this color.

1724
00:54:20,150 --> 00:54:21,380
Oh, right. This is trash.

1725
00:54:21,780 --> 00:54:23,420
I don't know why I brought trash.

1726
00:54:23,420 --> 00:54:24,780
Why do you carry around
so many napkins?

1727
00:54:24,780 --> 00:54:26,360
- They are trash.
- One.

1728
00:54:26,360 --> 00:54:28,250
Hold on.

1729
00:54:28,250 --> 00:54:29,730
(I got you.)

1730
00:54:29,730 --> 00:54:31,000
I got you!

1731
00:54:31,960 --> 00:54:35,460
Mr. Yang, you painted a big picture.

1732
00:54:35,460 --> 00:54:37,770
I can't paint a big picture
by myself.

1733
00:54:38,840 --> 00:54:40,130
This is ridiculous.

1734
00:54:40,130 --> 00:54:41,730
- 4, 5...
- This is ridiculous.

1735
00:54:41,730 --> 00:54:43,340
In any case,

1736
00:54:43,940 --> 00:54:45,980
- the chairman has power.
- That's true.

1737
00:54:45,980 --> 00:54:47,780
Will you give us...

1738
00:54:47,780 --> 00:54:49,670
- an advantage...
- You promised earlier.

1739
00:54:49,670 --> 00:54:51,150
- during the mission?
- I will do that.

1740
00:54:51,150 --> 00:54:52,710
- You promised earlier...
- Now...

1741
00:54:52,710 --> 00:54:55,050
- to take good care of us.
- Don't worry.

1742
00:54:55,050 --> 00:54:56,780
- All right.
- This isn't over yet.

1743
00:54:56,960 --> 00:54:58,130
Form a single line.

1744
00:54:58,130 --> 00:54:59,250
- Okay.
- Okay.

1745
00:54:59,250 --> 00:55:00,690
That's a bit...

1746
00:55:00,730 --> 00:55:03,360
I am different
from the former chairman.

1747
00:55:03,460 --> 00:55:05,170
- I am different.
- There is more discipline.

1748
00:55:05,170 --> 00:55:08,090
I will collect
a fee of two caramels each.

1749
00:55:08,090 --> 00:55:09,960
- What?
- Hold on.

1750
00:55:09,960 --> 00:55:11,130
(He will forcibly take caramels
from everyone.)

1751
00:55:11,130 --> 00:55:12,460
- Hold on.
- Two caramels?

1752
00:55:12,460 --> 00:55:13,710
Let's bring him down.

1753
00:55:13,710 --> 00:55:14,730
I only received two caramels.

1754
00:55:14,730 --> 00:55:16,570
- Let's bring him down.
- This is ridiculous.

1755
00:55:16,570 --> 00:55:18,050
- I only received two caramels.
- Give them up.

1756
00:55:18,050 --> 00:55:19,670
But I didn't vote for you.

1757
00:55:19,670 --> 00:55:21,340
But I became the chairman.

1758
00:55:21,340 --> 00:55:22,340
- This is...
- Give them up.

1759
00:55:22,340 --> 00:55:23,480
This is tyranny!

1760
00:55:23,480 --> 00:55:24,840
No, it isn't. Give me the caramels.

1761
00:55:24,840 --> 00:55:26,750
I will give them to you first.

1762
00:55:26,750 --> 00:55:28,590
(Please know that I am loyal.)

1763
00:55:28,590 --> 00:55:29,860
- I was the first one.
- Give them up.

1764
00:55:29,860 --> 00:55:31,460
- So suddenly?
- Give me two caramels each.

1765
00:55:31,780 --> 00:55:32,960
I didn't even vote for you.

1766
00:55:32,960 --> 00:55:35,250
Be that as it may,
I became the chairman.

1767
00:55:35,250 --> 00:55:36,690
Please exempt me...

1768
00:55:36,690 --> 00:55:37,800
since I was a candidate.

1769
00:55:37,800 --> 00:55:38,800
- I was a fellow candidate.
- Give them to me.

1770
00:55:38,800 --> 00:55:39,920
We will give you one caramel.

1771
00:55:39,920 --> 00:55:41,400
- Please exempt us.
- We will give you one caramel.

1772
00:55:41,400 --> 00:55:42,940
I will run things smoothly,
so you don't need to worry.

1773
00:55:42,940 --> 00:55:45,130
- I have 3 children.
- Give me 1 caramel.

1774
00:55:45,230 --> 00:55:46,630
- I have 3 children.
- Give me 1 caramel then.

1775
00:55:46,630 --> 00:55:47,860
- One caramel.
- We elected a weirdo.

1776
00:55:47,860 --> 00:55:50,110
We elected a weirdo.

1777
00:55:50,170 --> 00:55:51,340
- Give me one each.
- How did this happen?

1778
00:55:51,340 --> 00:55:52,750
- Give me one each.
- We voted for the wrong candidate.

1779
00:55:52,750 --> 00:55:54,710
Ji Hyo, give me two caramels.
You have a lot of caramels.

1780
00:55:54,710 --> 00:55:56,420
- That's not true.
- Give me two caramels.

1781
00:55:56,480 --> 00:55:57,610
Suk Jin, how many do you have?

1782
00:55:57,710 --> 00:55:58,750
What? What do you mean?

1783
00:55:58,750 --> 00:56:00,610
- How many do you have?
- I can give you two caramels.

1784
00:56:00,610 --> 00:56:02,110
It's not a problem.

1785
00:56:02,110 --> 00:56:03,360
Give me two caramels.

1786
00:56:03,360 --> 00:56:05,590
This chairman is a thug.
What is going on?

1787
00:56:06,190 --> 00:56:07,860
- We voted for the wrong candidate.
- How will you use the caramels?

1788
00:56:07,860 --> 00:56:09,730
These caramels are
the congratulatory gift...

1789
00:56:09,730 --> 00:56:11,050
from you guys.

1790
00:56:11,050 --> 00:56:12,590
The congratulatory gift?

1791
00:56:12,590 --> 00:56:13,670
You should use them...

1792
00:56:13,670 --> 00:56:14,940
for our improvements.

1793
00:56:14,940 --> 00:56:17,340
You should use them
for our improvements, not yours.

1794
00:56:17,340 --> 00:56:18,340
I had to give up
the caramels I received.

1795
00:56:18,340 --> 00:56:19,730
I will use them for a good cause.

1796
00:56:19,860 --> 00:56:22,300
I will use them for a good cause.

1797
00:56:22,300 --> 00:56:23,610
I gave up on 11 caramels
and voted for you.

1798
00:56:23,610 --> 00:56:25,400
- Don't worry.
- I gave up on 11 caramels.

1799
00:56:25,400 --> 00:56:27,480
Don't worry.
Now that I am the chairman,

1800
00:56:27,480 --> 00:56:29,550
we need to implement
the sharing economy.

1801
00:56:29,710 --> 00:56:30,840
Do you know what that means?

1802
00:56:30,840 --> 00:56:31,880
- The sharing economy?
- The sharing economy.

1803
00:56:31,880 --> 00:56:33,420
It's a good thing.

1804
00:56:33,650 --> 00:56:35,980
This atmosphere is
the sharing economy, right?

1805
00:56:35,980 --> 00:56:37,690
The ancestors' wisdom.

1806
00:56:37,690 --> 00:56:40,420
I will distribute the caramels...

1807
00:56:40,420 --> 00:56:42,230
to those who fall behind.

1808
00:56:42,230 --> 00:56:43,230
You will use them for a good cause.

1809
00:56:43,230 --> 00:56:44,550
I will use them for a good cause.

1810
00:56:44,550 --> 00:56:46,360
It's time for the last mission.

1811
00:56:46,360 --> 00:56:48,630
The last mission requires you
to school your face...

1812
00:56:48,690 --> 00:56:50,630
and predict the opponent's move.

1813
00:56:50,630 --> 00:56:52,360
It's the Card Game of Wits.

1814
00:56:52,770 --> 00:56:55,170
Four members will team up
and play the game.

1815
00:56:55,340 --> 00:56:57,800
Each member will get
red and blue cards...

1816
00:56:57,800 --> 00:57:00,250
with a number from 1 to 10.

1817
00:57:00,710 --> 00:57:03,020
You will put a red card
on your forehead...

1818
00:57:03,050 --> 00:57:05,050
and check a blue card alone.

1819
00:57:05,050 --> 00:57:06,550
Then you will place a bet.

1820
00:57:06,550 --> 00:57:08,980
You will win if the sum
of the numbers is the highest.

1821
00:57:08,980 --> 00:57:09,980
(The winner will take
all the caramels!)

1822
00:57:09,980 --> 00:57:12,420
My goodness.
The real game will begin now.

1823
00:57:12,420 --> 00:57:14,960
- The real game will begin now.
- The real game.

1824
00:57:14,960 --> 00:57:17,460
When the member ahead of you
places a bet,

1825
00:57:17,460 --> 00:57:20,530
you can either
place the same bet, fold,

1826
00:57:20,530 --> 00:57:22,670
or place a higher bet.

1827
00:57:22,670 --> 00:57:24,670
You listened to the rules just now.

1828
00:57:24,670 --> 00:57:26,630
Please explain the rules.

1829
00:57:28,230 --> 00:57:29,570
A blue card goes on your forehead.

1830
00:57:29,570 --> 00:57:31,570
- A red card.
- A red card goes on your forehead.

1831
00:57:31,570 --> 00:57:33,480
A blue card gets hidden.

1832
00:57:33,610 --> 00:57:34,710
- Then you school your face and...
- Ji Hyo.

1833
00:57:34,710 --> 00:57:36,110
Please explain
the rules of the game.

1834
00:57:36,110 --> 00:57:37,750
For goodness' sake.

1835
00:57:37,840 --> 00:57:39,110
A blue card goes on your forehead.

1836
00:57:39,110 --> 00:57:40,690
- A red card.
- A red card goes on your forehead.

1837
00:57:40,690 --> 00:57:42,420
A red card goes on your forehead.

1838
00:57:42,420 --> 00:57:44,150
- Okay.
- You check the blue card alone.

1839
00:57:44,150 --> 00:57:46,190
- Now, Chairman Yu.
- We need to decide on the teams.

1840
00:57:46,650 --> 00:57:48,690
Do we need to pay up
to get assigned to a team?

1841
00:57:49,500 --> 00:57:52,070
I will take out my caramels.
Please assign me...

1842
00:57:52,070 --> 00:57:53,630
- to a good team.
- For goodness' sake.

1843
00:57:53,630 --> 00:57:55,400
- Stop it.
- Earlier,

1844
00:57:55,400 --> 00:57:57,130
I gave you two caramels first.

1845
00:57:57,130 --> 00:57:58,940
- All right, Firstly,
- Do we need to pay up?

1846
00:57:58,940 --> 00:58:00,230
- Kwang Soo should come here.
- Okay.

1847
00:58:00,230 --> 00:58:02,300
- They have quick wits.
- It's okay.

1848
00:58:02,300 --> 00:58:04,230
I can make...

1849
00:58:04,230 --> 00:58:06,250
the best team...

1850
00:58:06,250 --> 00:58:08,820
with the members
who are good with numbers.

1851
00:58:09,340 --> 00:58:10,340
Jong Kook, come this way.

1852
00:58:10,340 --> 00:58:11,590
Okay!

1853
00:58:11,590 --> 00:58:12,590
It's a strong team.

1854
00:58:12,590 --> 00:58:14,210
I'm good with numbers.

1855
00:58:14,210 --> 00:58:15,690
This is a team.

1856
00:58:15,780 --> 00:58:17,710
- Yes.
- You will go against each other.

1857
00:58:17,710 --> 00:58:19,190
What? Aren't we on the same side?

1858
00:58:19,480 --> 00:58:22,090
You said we are a team.
You said we are a team.

1859
00:58:22,250 --> 00:58:25,170
- What?
- Will they go against each other?

1860
00:58:25,170 --> 00:58:26,770
I gave you so many caramels!

1861
00:58:26,770 --> 00:58:27,920
My goodness.

1862
00:58:27,920 --> 00:58:29,840
I wanted to put them
on the same side.

1863
00:58:29,840 --> 00:58:30,940
I didn't know. I am sorry.

1864
00:58:30,940 --> 00:58:32,800
- It was my mistake.
- Let's go.

1865
00:58:32,840 --> 00:58:34,000
Excuse me.

1866
00:58:34,130 --> 00:58:35,980
Please help me compete with Ji Hyo.

1867
00:58:37,500 --> 00:58:39,780
Let me compete with Ji Hyo.

1868
00:58:39,780 --> 00:58:41,480
Okay. I get it.

1869
00:58:41,480 --> 00:58:43,110
- I gave you two bills.
- Okay.

1870
00:58:43,110 --> 00:58:45,420
- Please.
- Tell me if you want anyone.

1871
00:58:45,420 --> 00:58:47,380
Send Suk Jin to me,
and I'll give you three.

1872
00:58:48,860 --> 00:58:51,280
It looks like we can win
many caramels in this game.

1873
00:58:51,750 --> 00:58:54,690
Tell me if there's anyone
you want to compete with.

1874
00:58:56,090 --> 00:58:57,420
- Ji Hyo.
- Four people compete, right?

1875
00:58:58,400 --> 00:59:00,670
- Who do you want?
- Ji Hyo.

1876
00:59:00,960 --> 00:59:02,940
We're giving
Jae Suk caramels voluntarily.

1877
00:59:04,130 --> 00:59:05,610
- She's too popular.
- The problem is,

1878
00:59:05,610 --> 00:59:07,630
too many people want Ji Hyo.

1879
00:59:07,800 --> 00:59:09,070
(Many people want to
compete with her.)

1880
00:59:09,070 --> 00:59:10,340
- She's too popular.
- Then...

1881
00:59:10,340 --> 00:59:12,570
- I'll...
- Okay.

1882
00:59:13,280 --> 00:59:14,650
Do you want anyone?

1883
00:59:14,650 --> 00:59:17,420
How many caramels
is he taking from us?

1884
00:59:18,190 --> 00:59:20,520
- His position is amazing.
- He's taking everything.

1885
00:59:20,520 --> 00:59:22,920
- Stop taking caramels!
- I should have run too.

1886
00:59:22,920 --> 00:59:24,320
Ji Hyo, who do you want?

1887
00:59:24,320 --> 00:59:26,530
(Who does Ji Hyo want?)

1888
00:59:27,030 --> 00:59:28,530
Four people compete, right?

1889
00:59:28,530 --> 00:59:30,320
- Yes. We need two more people.
- What?

1890
00:59:30,800 --> 00:59:32,900
You can't ask me
to get you out of the game.

1891
00:59:33,300 --> 00:59:34,570
What are you talking about?

1892
00:59:34,730 --> 00:59:36,190
- Then just go home!
- She wants to be out?

1893
00:59:36,190 --> 00:59:39,270
She wants to be out?
She doesn't want to play?

1894
00:59:39,270 --> 00:59:41,230
- She wants to be out?
- She doesn't understand the rules.

1895
00:59:41,230 --> 00:59:43,000
How can you say that?

1896
00:59:43,000 --> 00:59:44,170
Ji Hyo, you should play too.

1897
00:59:44,170 --> 00:59:46,170
You can't ask me
to get you out of the game.

1898
00:59:46,170 --> 00:59:49,170
Anyway, Kwang Soo, Jong Kook,
you can sit at the table.

1899
00:59:49,170 --> 00:59:50,210
- Okay.
- Should we sit?

1900
00:59:50,210 --> 00:59:51,940
- And then...
- They'll be too strong.

1901
00:59:51,940 --> 00:59:53,380
- You want to avoid them.
- Give me this.

1902
00:59:53,380 --> 00:59:54,920
So Min, sit at the table.

1903
00:59:54,920 --> 00:59:56,020
You didn't give him any caramels.

1904
00:59:56,020 --> 00:59:58,650
You didn't give me any caramels,
so sit at the table.

1905
00:59:58,650 --> 01:00:00,650
Hold on. Haha gave me one,

1906
01:00:00,650 --> 01:00:01,690
- I gave you 1.
- Se Chan gave me 1...

1907
01:00:01,690 --> 01:00:02,960
- I gave you 4.
- You gave me 4.

1908
01:00:02,960 --> 01:00:04,190
- I gave you 3.
- You gave me 3.

1909
01:00:04,190 --> 01:00:06,860
I feel hurt. The two people
sitting here...

1910
01:00:06,860 --> 01:00:08,770
are the ones you promised
to give 11 bills to.

1911
01:00:09,030 --> 01:00:10,690
- Hold on.
- I have to ask.

1912
01:00:10,690 --> 01:00:11,960
Why am I sitting here...

1913
01:00:11,960 --> 01:00:13,940
- without any caramels?
- I didn't mean it.

1914
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:15,730
- It just happened that way.
- Why...

1915
01:00:15,730 --> 01:00:17,530
- I know.
- I'm sorry. Wait just a minute.

1916
01:00:17,530 --> 01:00:18,610
Chairman Yang.

1917
01:00:18,610 --> 01:00:19,750
- I mean, Candidate Yang.
- Yes?

1918
01:00:19,750 --> 01:00:21,070
You go sit there.

1919
01:00:21,070 --> 01:00:22,320
- Okay.
- Okay.

1920
01:00:22,320 --> 01:00:24,320
- Please sit down, the four of you.
- Okay.

1921
01:00:25,780 --> 01:00:28,610
- We don't know how Se Chan will do.
- He'll do well.

1922
01:00:28,610 --> 01:00:31,020
In this game, you shouldn't
think too much.

1923
01:00:31,360 --> 01:00:34,880
All members of that team...
From Kka Chi,

1924
01:00:35,250 --> 01:00:37,960
- the chairman,
- Yes.

1925
01:00:37,960 --> 01:00:39,770
and Goni...

1926
01:00:40,190 --> 01:00:41,900
- To Madam Jeong.
- All right.

1927
01:00:42,300 --> 01:00:45,070
First, please bet one caramel each.

1928
01:00:45,400 --> 01:00:47,460
- This is so fun.
- Okay.

1929
01:00:47,670 --> 01:00:48,780
Pick carefully.

1930
01:00:49,170 --> 01:00:53,250
I've always wanted to try
sitting at a table like this.

1931
01:00:53,250 --> 01:00:54,710
There are tables like this
at board game cafes too.

1932
01:00:54,710 --> 01:00:55,880
- Really?
- Yes.

1933
01:00:55,880 --> 01:00:58,280
Please put one red card
on your forehead.

1934
01:00:58,280 --> 01:00:59,780
- Any card?
- Pick carefully.

1935
01:00:59,780 --> 01:01:01,150
- Gosh, this is driving me crazy.
- Okay.

1936
01:01:01,150 --> 01:01:02,690
Put it on your forehead
without showing it to anyone.

1937
01:01:02,690 --> 01:01:05,150
(Careful)

1938
01:01:05,420 --> 01:01:07,480
(They pick
their first cards quietly.)

1939
01:01:07,480 --> 01:01:08,550
Here?

1940
01:01:09,400 --> 01:01:10,750
Is this the front?

1941
01:01:10,750 --> 01:01:12,230
- Is it?
- Yes.

1942
01:01:12,230 --> 01:01:13,460
(Even the audience
becomes immersed.)

1943
01:01:13,690 --> 01:01:15,230
Like this? Is this right?

1944
01:01:18,800 --> 01:01:21,000
Pick one blue card
and check the number secretly.

1945
01:01:21,000 --> 01:01:22,000
Guys.

1946
01:01:22,500 --> 01:01:24,940
I may run out of money,
but I never quit gambling.

1947
01:01:25,280 --> 01:01:27,070
Does he think this is for real?

1948
01:01:27,750 --> 01:01:28,920
This isn't for real.

1949
01:01:28,920 --> 01:01:31,280
Chewing a caramel and all...
I think I've seen him in a movie.

1950
01:01:31,280 --> 01:01:33,280
I'm sorry, but this isn't Las Vegas.

1951
01:01:33,280 --> 01:01:35,320
(The muscular chairman is
chewing a caramel in Las Vegas.)

1952
01:01:35,320 --> 01:01:37,590
Pick one blue card
and check the number secretly.

1953
01:01:37,590 --> 01:01:39,360
So Min, don't show it to the others.

1954
01:01:39,360 --> 01:01:40,550
Don't show it to the others.

1955
01:01:40,750 --> 01:01:43,030
Gosh, this is bad.
I don't know what to do.

1956
01:01:43,030 --> 01:01:44,400
- I don't know what to do.
- Don't show it to the others.

1957
01:01:45,070 --> 01:01:49,170
(You should keep a poker face
even if you get a big number.)

1958
01:01:50,840 --> 01:01:51,900
Okay.

1959
01:01:51,900 --> 01:01:54,110
(They try to look calm
after seeing their cards.)

1960
01:01:54,570 --> 01:01:56,980
(The player
with the greatest sum wins.)

1961
01:01:56,980 --> 01:01:58,800
We'll start with So Min.

1962
01:01:58,800 --> 01:02:00,340
- Here we go.
- Go ahead.

1963
01:02:00,340 --> 01:02:02,050
- All in?
- One?

1964
01:02:02,840 --> 01:02:03,840
Kwang Soo.

1965
01:02:04,980 --> 01:02:06,610
I'll bet one.

1966
01:02:06,610 --> 01:02:08,210
I'll bet one and...

1967
01:02:08,210 --> 01:02:09,750
(Se Chan bets 1 caramel plus...)

1968
01:02:09,750 --> 01:02:12,530
- raise the bet by three.
- Three?

1969
01:02:12,690 --> 01:02:15,090
- Hey, Catfish.
- I bet big.

1970
01:02:15,820 --> 01:02:17,960
Are you sure?
You raised the bet by three?

1971
01:02:17,960 --> 01:02:20,300
We should keep a poker face too.

1972
01:02:20,570 --> 01:02:22,400
(After thinking...)

1973
01:02:22,400 --> 01:02:25,070
I fold.

1974
01:02:25,070 --> 01:02:26,270
- What?
- You fold?

1975
01:02:26,730 --> 01:02:28,500
My number must be big.

1976
01:02:28,500 --> 01:02:30,130
So Min, you have to bet three more.

1977
01:02:30,130 --> 01:02:32,480
So Min, either bet three more
or fold.

1978
01:02:32,480 --> 01:02:33,840
(With Jong Kook out,
she has to think.)

1979
01:02:33,840 --> 01:02:34,880
Gosh.

1980
01:02:34,880 --> 01:02:36,780
(They stare at her
with "9" on their foreheads.)

1981
01:02:37,170 --> 01:02:38,550
(Should I continue or not?)

1982
01:02:38,550 --> 01:02:40,340
(Poker face)

1983
01:02:40,340 --> 01:02:41,480
Gosh, this is...

1984
01:02:42,750 --> 01:02:45,130
I should have a taste.
This is our first round anyway.

1985
01:02:45,750 --> 01:02:47,250
(She is attracted
to the sweetness of the caramels.)

1986
01:02:47,250 --> 01:02:49,250
- So Min.
- Of course you should.

1987
01:02:49,750 --> 01:02:51,800
- So Min.
- You want to keep going?

1988
01:02:51,800 --> 01:02:52,960
- She wants a taste?
- So Min.

1989
01:02:52,960 --> 01:02:55,360
If you bet 3 now,
you'll have to bet 10 later.

1990
01:02:55,590 --> 01:02:56,860
- For now...
- Call?

1991
01:02:57,340 --> 01:02:58,900
- I bet three more.
- Kwang Soo.

1992
01:02:58,900 --> 01:02:59,900
Kwang Soo.

1993
01:03:00,570 --> 01:03:01,780
- I fold.
- Bet three more.

1994
01:03:02,130 --> 01:03:03,500
- What?
- Okay.

1995
01:03:03,500 --> 01:03:04,570
You fold?

1996
01:03:05,070 --> 01:03:06,550
- Are you done?
- This is our first round.

1997
01:03:06,550 --> 01:03:07,750
- Se Chan, this is our first round.
- I should go all in.

1998
01:03:07,750 --> 01:03:09,170
This is our first round, Se Chan.

1999
01:03:09,170 --> 01:03:10,650
This is our first round.

2000
01:03:10,650 --> 01:03:11,710
I raise the bet by six.

2001
01:03:11,710 --> 01:03:14,320
(Catfish raises the bet by 6.)

2002
01:03:14,320 --> 01:03:17,360
If you're scared, fold.

2003
01:03:17,360 --> 01:03:19,460
- Then you don't have to bet...
- Okay. Call.

2004
01:03:19,460 --> 01:03:21,050
(Okay, I bet 6 more.)

2005
01:03:21,280 --> 01:03:23,090
- Call?
- Okay.

2006
01:03:23,590 --> 01:03:24,860
- I could lose too.
- Gosh.

2007
01:03:25,300 --> 01:03:26,820
I should have stayed.

2008
01:03:26,820 --> 01:03:28,670
- So Min.
- Very good.

2009
01:03:28,670 --> 01:03:30,090
Who knows?

2010
01:03:30,090 --> 01:03:31,800
My blue card may be very good.

2011
01:03:31,800 --> 01:03:33,860
So Min, you look so cute
with that card on your forehead.

2012
01:03:33,860 --> 01:03:35,280
Please reveal your cards now.

2013
01:03:35,280 --> 01:03:36,500
- The thing is,
- Let's see the numbers.

2014
01:03:36,500 --> 01:03:40,050
Se Chan must have raised the bet...

2015
01:03:40,050 --> 01:03:41,300
because his card is good.

2016
01:03:41,550 --> 01:03:43,940
(Se Chan's number on his forehead
is bigger than So Min's.)

2017
01:03:43,940 --> 01:03:45,550
- So Min.
- Should I see the number?

2018
01:03:45,550 --> 01:03:46,750
Check your card.

2019
01:03:47,380 --> 01:03:48,710
- Gosh.
- It's too small.

2020
01:03:48,710 --> 01:03:50,110
(She is disappointed at the number
on her forehead.)

2021
01:03:50,110 --> 01:03:52,530
- It's 1.
- My other number is 8.

2022
01:03:52,530 --> 01:03:53,650
- Right?
- Really?

2023
01:03:53,650 --> 01:03:54,980
- That's why.
- It's nine in total.

2024
01:03:54,980 --> 01:03:56,820
(So Min's sum is 9.)

2025
01:03:56,820 --> 01:03:58,130
So it was worth it.

2026
01:03:58,130 --> 01:04:00,090
- Kwang Soo...
- So it was worth it.

2027
01:04:00,090 --> 01:04:01,940
- Kwang Soo, you...
- Mine was nine?

2028
01:04:01,940 --> 01:04:03,360
- Yes.
- Yes.

2029
01:04:04,500 --> 01:04:08,030
(He didn't make use of
the number on his forehead.)

2030
01:04:08,440 --> 01:04:10,710
- What's your other number?
- You should have kept going.

2031
01:04:10,710 --> 01:04:11,880
It's two.

2032
01:04:13,170 --> 01:04:15,110
(Kwang Soo's sum is 11.)

2033
01:04:15,110 --> 01:04:16,650
It's too small,
so I couldn't continue.

2034
01:04:16,650 --> 01:04:18,840
- Se Chan's number is too big.
- It's too big.

2035
01:04:18,840 --> 01:04:20,940
- I know.
- Guys, my sum is 19.

2036
01:04:20,940 --> 01:04:24,920
(Se Chan's sum is 19.)

2037
01:04:25,090 --> 01:04:27,130
- Really?
- I should've gone all in.

2038
01:04:27,130 --> 01:04:28,280
You should have gone all in.

2039
01:04:28,280 --> 01:04:30,690
Someone could have lost big.

2040
01:04:31,900 --> 01:04:33,800
- It's 19.
- Candidate Yang.

2041
01:04:33,800 --> 01:04:35,270
Are you painting
the big picture now?

2042
01:04:35,270 --> 01:04:36,360
You picked good cards.

2043
01:04:36,360 --> 01:04:38,360
Someone could have lost big.

2044
01:04:38,360 --> 01:04:40,300
I almost turned my life around.

2045
01:04:40,300 --> 01:04:42,130
- You're painting the big picture!
- The number on my forehead is 3,

2046
01:04:42,130 --> 01:04:43,530
and I picked two.

2047
01:04:43,530 --> 01:04:44,670
Good that I folded early.

2048
01:04:44,670 --> 01:04:46,250
If this number was smaller,
So Min would have continued.

2049
01:04:46,250 --> 01:04:48,780
- It's because of this.
- Please discard all cards.

2050
01:04:48,780 --> 01:04:50,250
Se Chan, you can take everything.

2051
01:04:50,250 --> 01:04:52,210
We can't use "9" again?

2052
01:04:52,690 --> 01:04:54,250
Gosh, I wasted "9" like this?

2053
01:04:54,250 --> 01:04:56,250
We don't have "9" or "10" anymore.

2054
01:04:56,920 --> 01:04:59,030
Se Chan discarded "10".

2055
01:04:59,030 --> 01:05:00,590
We don't have "10" anymore.

2056
01:05:00,590 --> 01:05:01,780
But we can still have "10"
on our foreheads, right?

2057
01:05:01,780 --> 01:05:03,030
- Yes.
- That's right.

2058
01:05:03,030 --> 01:05:04,150
(They can still have "10"
on their foreheads.)

2059
01:05:04,400 --> 01:05:06,400
- Please pick your cards.
- Put it on your forehead.

2060
01:05:06,860 --> 01:05:08,190
Raise the bet in the beginning.

2061
01:05:08,190 --> 01:05:10,000
(They all have numbers
on their foreheads now.)

2062
01:05:10,000 --> 01:05:11,300
Check your blue cards now.

2063
01:05:11,300 --> 01:05:12,940
(They check their blue cards.)

2064
01:05:12,940 --> 01:05:17,000
I can see who is going out first.

2065
01:05:17,000 --> 01:05:18,780
So the three of them...

2066
01:05:19,050 --> 01:05:22,070
are playing So Min?

2067
01:05:22,070 --> 01:05:24,610
(Jeon Pushover)

2068
01:05:25,070 --> 01:05:26,420
Is she your target?

2069
01:05:26,820 --> 01:05:28,440
She already lost.

2070
01:05:28,780 --> 01:05:30,610
(Are you ready to rip her off?)

2071
01:05:30,860 --> 01:05:31,960
(I'm ready.)

2072
01:05:32,230 --> 01:05:34,030
(I'm ready too.)

2073
01:05:35,050 --> 01:05:36,090
So Min.

2074
01:05:36,090 --> 01:05:38,590
(What will So Min do,
surrounded by three cheaters?)

2075
01:05:40,090 --> 01:05:41,230
I raise the bet by four.

2076
01:05:41,230 --> 01:05:42,300
- Already?
- Yes.

2077
01:05:43,300 --> 01:05:45,070
- Call.
- Call?

2078
01:05:45,070 --> 01:05:46,210
- Call?
- Yes.

2079
01:05:46,210 --> 01:05:48,840
I raise the bet by five.

2080
01:05:49,710 --> 01:05:51,000
It's 10 in total.

2081
01:05:51,570 --> 01:05:53,400
- That's big.
- Se Chan.

2082
01:05:53,570 --> 01:05:54,980
- We can't...
- I don't think I can go on.

2083
01:05:54,980 --> 01:05:56,020
Be quiet.

2084
01:05:56,020 --> 01:05:57,820
- I fold.
- You fold?

2085
01:05:57,820 --> 01:05:59,020
- You fold?
- Yes.

2086
01:05:59,020 --> 01:06:00,920
It's between those two now.
You can play one more round.

2087
01:06:00,920 --> 01:06:02,920
(It's between these 2 now.)

2088
01:06:03,380 --> 01:06:05,960
So Min, you have to bet five more.

2089
01:06:05,960 --> 01:06:07,650
(As So Min has "2" on her forehead,
Kwang Soo is sure he'll win.)

2090
01:06:07,650 --> 01:06:09,690
(He goes all in.)

2091
01:06:10,150 --> 01:06:11,900
(It's exciting.)

2092
01:06:12,320 --> 01:06:14,500
Either bet five more or fold.

2093
01:06:14,770 --> 01:06:16,270
- I bet five more.
- Call.

2094
01:06:17,000 --> 01:06:18,670
- That's it. It's over.
- Let's see the numbers now.

2095
01:06:18,670 --> 01:06:19,730
(It's time to reveal the cards.)

2096
01:06:20,440 --> 01:06:21,610
(So Min's number on her forehead
is much smaller.)

2097
01:06:21,610 --> 01:06:22,900
Mine is two. What's yours?

2098
01:06:22,900 --> 01:06:24,380
What's your other number, So Min?

2099
01:06:24,380 --> 01:06:27,150
- It's nine.
- Gosh.

2100
01:06:27,480 --> 01:06:28,500
It's 11 in total.

2101
01:06:29,780 --> 01:06:31,480
(Kwang Soo seems to have
an advantage for now.)

2102
01:06:31,480 --> 01:06:33,090
What if his other number is one?

2103
01:06:34,840 --> 01:06:37,460
(Kwang Soo will win
if his other number is 2 or bigger.)

2104
01:06:37,460 --> 01:06:40,030
(What number is on his blue card?)

2105
01:06:40,030 --> 01:06:41,090
It's one.

2106
01:06:41,590 --> 01:06:43,150
(It's 1?)

2107
01:06:44,150 --> 01:06:47,000
(How can it be 1?)

2108
01:06:47,000 --> 01:06:48,460
It's a big number again.

2109
01:06:48,460 --> 01:06:50,030
(Kwang Soo raised the bet
to make So Min give up.)

2110
01:06:50,030 --> 01:06:51,090
It was 10?

2111
01:06:51,960 --> 01:06:53,170
(Even though he wasted "10",
it's a tie.)

2112
01:06:53,170 --> 01:06:54,530
What happens now? Do I win?

2113
01:06:54,530 --> 01:06:56,480
- No. It's a tie.
- No?

2114
01:06:56,780 --> 01:06:59,400
Pick one red card, each of you.

2115
01:06:59,400 --> 01:07:01,250
The one with a bigger number wins.

2116
01:07:01,250 --> 01:07:02,670
Pick one from the rest.

2117
01:07:02,980 --> 01:07:05,550
- 1, 2, 3.
- Pick 1 red card.

2118
01:07:05,550 --> 01:07:07,380
- Just a second.
- 1, 2, 3.

2119
01:07:07,380 --> 01:07:08,420
Okay.

2120
01:07:10,360 --> 01:07:12,420
- It's decided now.
- It's decided.

2121
01:07:13,050 --> 01:07:14,630
- What's my number? Did I lose?
- So Min, show me.

2122
01:07:14,630 --> 01:07:16,030
- Did I lose?
- Kwang Soo wins.

2123
01:07:16,030 --> 01:07:17,030
Okay!

2124
01:07:17,030 --> 01:07:18,530
(Kwang Soo wins!)

2125
01:07:19,670 --> 01:07:21,570
(Showing off)

2126
01:07:22,230 --> 01:07:23,860
The three of them ripped her off.

2127
01:07:23,860 --> 01:07:25,070
(They celebrate together.)

2128
01:07:25,460 --> 01:07:27,500
Kwang Soo. So Min.

2129
01:07:28,230 --> 01:07:29,570
(Disappointed)

2130
01:07:29,570 --> 01:07:31,110
What is this?

2131
01:07:31,110 --> 01:07:33,380
So Min is in trouble.
She has nothing left.

2132
01:07:33,380 --> 01:07:35,050
She lost everything.

2133
01:07:35,050 --> 01:07:37,670
- Here we go.
- This is our last round.

2134
01:07:37,670 --> 01:07:40,480
- I haven't picked "10" yet.
- Let me see.

2135
01:07:40,480 --> 01:07:42,150
- This is...
- Keep a poker face, So Min.

2136
01:07:42,920 --> 01:07:45,020
(She picks the card
for her forehead first.)

2137
01:07:45,020 --> 01:07:46,030
Let me see.

2138
01:07:46,030 --> 01:07:47,380
(So Min picked "10".)

2139
01:07:47,380 --> 01:07:48,590
Show me, So Min.

2140
01:07:48,920 --> 01:07:50,190
Show me, Kwang Soo.

2141
01:07:50,190 --> 01:07:51,420
(Kwang Soo picked "5",
and Se Chan picked "3".)

2142
01:07:51,420 --> 01:07:52,530
Okay.

2143
01:07:53,190 --> 01:07:54,300
Let's start.

2144
01:07:54,960 --> 01:07:56,440
- I'll pick one.
- Go ahead.

2145
01:07:56,440 --> 01:07:57,840
(She picks a blue card.)

2146
01:07:57,840 --> 01:08:00,530
(She chuckles.)

2147
01:08:01,070 --> 01:08:02,610
(She can't help but smile.)

2148
01:08:02,610 --> 01:08:03,710
What is it?

2149
01:08:04,130 --> 01:08:05,670
Why does she smile right away?

2150
01:08:05,670 --> 01:08:07,780
- Hey.
- I fold!

2151
01:08:09,940 --> 01:08:12,840
(The novice can't keep
a poker face.)

2152
01:08:12,840 --> 01:08:15,020
- So Min is so cute.
- Should I bet?

2153
01:08:15,520 --> 01:08:17,150
- I bet all seven.
- All in?

2154
01:08:17,150 --> 01:08:19,360
1, 2, 3, 4, 5,

2155
01:08:19,360 --> 01:08:20,690
- 6, 7. All in.
- So Min goes all in.

2156
01:08:20,690 --> 01:08:22,030
Okay. Kwang Soo.

2157
01:08:22,030 --> 01:08:23,050
(Confident)

2158
01:08:24,460 --> 01:08:26,420
- I fold.
- Why?

2159
01:08:26,420 --> 01:08:27,530
I fold too.

2160
01:08:28,230 --> 01:08:30,460
- Why? Why would you fold?
- Then I fold too.

2161
01:08:30,460 --> 01:08:31,540
Why?

2162
01:08:32,040 --> 01:08:33,240
Then I fold too.

2163
01:08:33,240 --> 01:08:35,300
(The three cheaters back out.)

2164
01:08:36,440 --> 01:08:39,410
(Everyone backs out upon seeing
the novice's smile.)

2165
01:08:39,410 --> 01:08:41,300
- I'm sorry.
- I almost got hit in the eye.

2166
01:08:41,410 --> 01:08:43,040
- I almost got hit in the eye.
- I couldn't go.

2167
01:08:43,040 --> 01:08:44,620
So Min. Look at your card.

2168
01:08:44,620 --> 01:08:45,710
- Look at it.
- I couldn't go.

2169
01:08:45,710 --> 01:08:46,880
I couldn't go.

2170
01:08:46,880 --> 01:08:48,080
- What are you holding?
- What is it?

2171
01:08:48,080 --> 01:08:49,990
I got "1".

2172
01:08:49,990 --> 01:08:51,020
(My blue card was "1".)

2173
01:08:51,880 --> 01:08:54,360
(My gosh, her blue card was "1"?)

2174
01:08:55,730 --> 01:08:57,090
- Then...
- I didn't stand a chance.

2175
01:08:57,120 --> 01:08:58,770
I got "1",

2176
01:08:58,770 --> 01:09:00,070
but the red card was also "1".

2177
01:09:00,290 --> 01:09:01,960
- I had "12"!
- That's "12".

2178
01:09:01,960 --> 01:09:03,630
You would've won with "12".

2179
01:09:03,830 --> 01:09:05,290
So Min won the bet.

2180
01:09:05,290 --> 01:09:08,240
But there aren't very many.

2181
01:09:08,270 --> 01:09:11,170
So Min.
This is why the association exists.

2182
01:09:12,740 --> 01:09:14,000
Are you sponsoring her?

2183
01:09:14,280 --> 01:09:15,740
This is why the association exists.

2184
01:09:15,740 --> 01:09:17,020
- Thank you.
- Do you understand?

2185
01:09:17,020 --> 01:09:18,240
- This is fun.
- Thank you.

2186
01:09:18,880 --> 01:09:20,450
Let's start with the red card.

2187
01:09:20,450 --> 01:09:21,450
(They start the second ground
with new members.)

2188
01:09:21,450 --> 01:09:22,490
- Shall we choose them?
- Yes.

2189
01:09:24,050 --> 01:09:26,120
(Ji Hyo 10, Suk Jin 2,
Jae Suk 3, Haha 8)

2190
01:09:26,120 --> 01:09:27,550
Put on your poker face.

2191
01:09:27,550 --> 01:09:28,860
We need to choose our blue cards.

2192
01:09:28,860 --> 01:09:29,950
(It's time to choose
their blue cards.)

2193
01:09:31,790 --> 01:09:32,900
(They are done checking.)

2194
01:09:32,900 --> 01:09:35,740
- This is fun.
- Let's start with Ji Hyo.

2195
01:09:35,740 --> 01:09:37,070
- Me?
- You can't do that.

2196
01:09:37,630 --> 01:09:38,660
I bet one.

2197
01:09:38,660 --> 01:09:39,740
(She submits 1 caramel.)

2198
01:09:40,130 --> 01:09:41,200
I call one.

2199
01:09:41,500 --> 01:09:43,170
He's at it again.

2200
01:09:43,170 --> 01:09:44,170
(He said one thing,
and they caught his bluff.)

2201
01:09:44,440 --> 01:09:45,800
- Please help him restrain himself.
- But...

2202
01:09:46,040 --> 01:09:47,150
I don't like...

2203
01:09:47,150 --> 01:09:49,410
- playing for a long time.
- He's incredible.

2204
01:09:49,410 --> 01:09:51,320
- I call 1 and raise 4.
- Go easy.

2205
01:09:51,320 --> 01:09:52,740
- Four.
- My goodness.

2206
01:09:52,740 --> 01:09:56,020
- I call four...
- You'd think he was rich.

2207
01:09:56,490 --> 01:09:58,080
- and raise 4.
- He raises 4.

2208
01:09:58,080 --> 01:09:59,490
- Okay.
- I'll make it nine.

2209
01:10:00,160 --> 01:10:02,860
They're betting a lot of caramels.

2210
01:10:02,860 --> 01:10:04,790
I put in 9,

2211
01:10:04,790 --> 01:10:06,920
- He put in 9.
- Really?

2212
01:10:06,920 --> 01:10:08,400
I don't know.

2213
01:10:08,400 --> 01:10:11,540
- He put in nine. What's this?
- 2, 4, 6,

2214
01:10:12,610 --> 01:10:14,070
8, 10.

2215
01:10:14,160 --> 01:10:15,330
- 10?
- Yes.

2216
01:10:15,330 --> 01:10:17,110
Then how much does Ji Hyo
have to put in?

2217
01:10:17,110 --> 01:10:18,630
- Ji Hyo needs to put in...
- I...

2218
01:10:18,630 --> 01:10:20,300
- 19.
- She needs to put in 17.

2219
01:10:20,500 --> 01:10:21,740
17?

2220
01:10:21,740 --> 01:10:23,020
- That's a lot.
- Are you going in?

2221
01:10:23,520 --> 01:10:24,540
Are you?

2222
01:10:24,840 --> 01:10:27,240
(Is Ji Hyo going for it?)

2223
01:10:29,190 --> 01:10:31,020
6, 8, 10.

2224
01:10:31,020 --> 01:10:33,250
- Really?
- I fold this round.

2225
01:10:33,530 --> 01:10:35,590
- I don't have enough.
- Why did you fold after counting?

2226
01:10:35,590 --> 01:10:36,920
I counted to see how many
I had left.

2227
01:10:36,920 --> 01:10:39,230
How many do I need to put in
to continue?

2228
01:10:39,230 --> 01:10:40,460
You have to start at 10.

2229
01:10:40,460 --> 01:10:42,770
- You...
- 1, 2, 3, 4.

2230
01:10:42,770 --> 01:10:45,240
7, 8, 9, 10.

2231
01:10:45,240 --> 01:10:46,910
Goodness. That's a lot of caramels.

2232
01:10:48,200 --> 01:10:49,800
I think two people will die
in this round alone.

2233
01:10:49,800 --> 01:10:51,630
Isn't it a waste to fold now?

2234
01:10:51,630 --> 01:10:52,800
- It is.
- It is.

2235
01:10:52,800 --> 01:10:54,150
They would lose
the caramels they put in.

2236
01:10:54,540 --> 01:10:56,410
I think Haha is going to play
until the end.

2237
01:10:56,410 --> 01:10:57,520
He has to at this point.

2238
01:10:57,520 --> 01:10:58,840
I have 12 left.

2239
01:10:59,040 --> 01:11:00,540
- I also...
- I don't know.

2240
01:11:00,540 --> 01:11:02,690
I don't like playing a game
for too long.

2241
01:11:02,690 --> 01:11:04,790
The chairman is quite bold.

2242
01:11:04,790 --> 01:11:06,190
I fold.

2243
01:11:06,190 --> 01:11:07,250
- What?
- I fold.

2244
01:11:07,250 --> 01:11:09,030
- Is it because you're scared?
- Yes, it is.

2245
01:11:09,030 --> 01:11:10,920
- Fold if you're scared.
- Then fold.

2246
01:11:10,920 --> 01:11:12,200
- What should we do now?
- We should show the cards.

2247
01:11:12,200 --> 01:11:14,790
Do we need to show?
Can't we go another round?

2248
01:11:14,790 --> 01:11:16,490
- You can.
- Bring it on.

2249
01:11:16,490 --> 01:11:18,070
- Okay. All in!
- Bring it on.

2250
01:11:18,070 --> 01:11:19,240
- How many?
- 12.

2251
01:11:19,240 --> 01:11:20,540
12.

2252
01:11:21,110 --> 01:11:22,440
12?

2253
01:11:22,440 --> 01:11:26,370
(If he has more than 12,
he can counterattack.)

2254
01:11:28,000 --> 01:11:29,240
Take one out.

2255
01:11:30,370 --> 01:11:32,950
(His voice is loud
compared to what he has.)

2256
01:11:33,240 --> 01:11:35,660
- Take one out.
- I'll let it slide.

2257
01:11:35,660 --> 01:11:38,380
- Accept it.
- Okay.

2258
01:11:38,550 --> 01:11:39,860
Haha must have a high card.

2259
01:11:39,860 --> 01:11:41,880
Should we start with Suk Jin?

2260
01:11:41,880 --> 01:11:43,730
The sum of my cards is 10.

2261
01:11:43,730 --> 01:11:45,090
- That isn't a low number.
- Ji Hyo.

2262
01:11:45,090 --> 01:11:46,530
I have four...

2263
01:11:46,530 --> 01:11:47,790
- I had a good hand.
- What's Ji Hyo's number?

2264
01:11:47,790 --> 01:11:49,490
Ji Hyo has a high number. It's 10.

2265
01:11:50,270 --> 01:11:51,540
What was your total?

2266
01:11:51,900 --> 01:11:53,200
- 14.
- What were you holding?

2267
01:11:53,330 --> 01:11:54,770
- Gosh. She had "14".
- 14.

2268
01:11:54,770 --> 01:11:56,870
- This is...
- Let's see Haha's number first.

2269
01:11:59,280 --> 01:12:01,870
(A lot of caramels are on the line
in this one match.)

2270
01:12:03,150 --> 01:12:06,450
(Who will take the caramels?)

2271
01:12:06,450 --> 01:12:07,620
(Jae Suk's card 3, Haha's card 8)

2272
01:12:07,620 --> 01:12:09,450
- He had "8". It's high.
- It's high.

2273
01:12:09,450 --> 01:12:10,520
I think the card
he's holding is high.

2274
01:12:10,520 --> 01:12:11,910
Let's take turns revealing our card.

2275
01:12:12,580 --> 01:12:14,860
- Okay.
- That card is weak. It's "3".

2276
01:12:14,860 --> 01:12:16,550
(Jae Suk's card 3, Haha's card 8)

2277
01:12:16,990 --> 01:12:19,330
(His blood sugar suddenly dropped.)

2278
01:12:19,920 --> 01:12:21,790
(The audience is having a blast.)

2279
01:12:22,540 --> 01:12:23,570
(If he loses, he goes bankrupt.)

2280
01:12:23,570 --> 01:12:27,540
We can only play one round
of something so fun.

2281
01:12:27,540 --> 01:12:30,040
- He should've collected 1 or 2.
- This is so fun.

2282
01:12:30,040 --> 01:12:32,080
1, 2, 3.

2283
01:12:32,980 --> 01:12:35,610
(They must put all their trust
in their blue card!)

2284
01:12:35,610 --> 01:12:37,620
1, 2, 3.

2285
01:12:38,340 --> 01:12:39,450
It's over.

2286
01:12:39,450 --> 01:12:41,320
(Jae Suk's blue card is "10".)

2287
01:12:42,150 --> 01:12:44,020
(Haha had "8" on his forehead.)

2288
01:12:44,020 --> 01:12:45,880
(He wins if his card
is higher than "6".)

2289
01:12:45,880 --> 01:12:47,360
(My gosh.)

2290
01:12:47,360 --> 01:12:48,360
Three.

2291
01:12:48,360 --> 01:12:50,250
(What is the number
on Haha's blue card?)

2292
01:12:50,250 --> 01:12:51,590
Haha had "10"?

2293
01:12:53,070 --> 01:12:55,660
(Haha was holding "10".)

2294
01:12:56,590 --> 01:12:58,590
(His coolness explodes.)

2295
01:12:58,590 --> 01:12:59,660
His total is 18?

2296
01:12:59,740 --> 01:13:00,800
- His total is 18?
- I...

2297
01:13:00,800 --> 01:13:02,940
He had "8" on his forehead,

2298
01:13:02,940 --> 01:13:04,630
- and he kept raising.
- You could've assumed he had "10".

2299
01:13:04,630 --> 01:13:07,580
- Jae Suk had "10" too.
- Drag him out. Stop.

2300
01:13:07,740 --> 01:13:09,580
- Let go.
- Come out.

2301
01:13:09,580 --> 01:13:12,040
- Come out. Come out!
- This was so fun.

2302
01:13:12,040 --> 01:13:13,190
Haha.

2303
01:13:13,190 --> 01:13:14,190
(Flinging)

2304
01:13:14,190 --> 01:13:15,380
- This was so fun.
- Get out!

2305
01:13:15,380 --> 01:13:16,790
Don't come back here.

2306
01:13:16,950 --> 01:13:18,950
Don't come back.

2307
01:13:19,530 --> 01:13:20,690
You should go.

2308
01:13:20,690 --> 01:13:21,990
I can't believe...

2309
01:13:22,030 --> 01:13:23,620
- I don't want it.
- Go and get something to eat.

2310
01:13:23,620 --> 01:13:24,730
(I'm sure you don't feel good.)

2311
01:13:25,420 --> 01:13:27,730
Life is like vapor in the air.

2312
01:13:27,730 --> 01:13:29,790
Why would you ruin the game?

2313
01:13:29,790 --> 01:13:30,940
(He learned a life lesson
through a card game.)

2314
01:13:30,940 --> 01:13:32,440
Gosh, I'm so angry.

2315
01:13:32,440 --> 01:13:34,940
This is so much fun,
but he only got to play it once.

2316
01:13:34,940 --> 01:13:36,330
This is hilarious.

2317
01:13:36,870 --> 01:13:38,610
- Excuse me. Mr. Chairman.
- Yes?

2318
01:13:38,610 --> 01:13:40,040
Go get me some water.

2319
01:13:41,840 --> 01:13:43,780
- I'm thirsty.
- He's moving.

2320
01:13:43,780 --> 01:13:46,820
Okay.
It's time for you to pay your dues.

2321
01:13:47,710 --> 01:13:50,520
- No way. I'm not going to pay.
- What are you saying?

2322
01:13:50,520 --> 01:13:51,620
What is this?

2323
01:13:51,620 --> 01:13:53,160
- Association fees.
- No way.

2324
01:13:53,160 --> 01:13:54,750
Since when did we have such fees?

2325
01:13:54,750 --> 01:13:56,400
- Association fees.
- How much?

2326
01:13:56,400 --> 01:13:57,830
5 from the person who won.

2327
01:13:57,830 --> 01:13:59,790
- Five?
- He's a thug.

2328
01:13:59,790 --> 01:14:01,460
- 5.
- 5?

2329
01:14:01,460 --> 01:14:03,290
- The association fee is 5 caramels.
- What are you doing?

2330
01:14:03,290 --> 01:14:05,540
Hurry up and give it to me.
You saw me help those in need.

2331
01:14:05,540 --> 01:14:07,240
- Just take 2.
- Give me 5. You won a lot.

2332
01:14:07,240 --> 01:14:08,500
Kwang Soo. Let's go bury him.

2333
01:14:08,500 --> 01:14:09,610
- This won't do.
- Hold on.

2334
01:14:09,910 --> 01:14:11,370
- Give me two.
- This won't do.

2335
01:14:11,370 --> 01:14:12,980
- What are you doing?
- Give me two.

2336
01:14:12,980 --> 01:14:14,800
- No, I helped those in need.
- Are you trying to sit here?

2337
01:14:14,800 --> 01:14:16,340
- You can't sit here.
- You can't sit here.

2338
01:14:16,340 --> 01:14:18,170
- Don't sit here.
- I'll give you two, just don't sit.

2339
01:14:18,170 --> 01:14:19,520
- Don't sit here.
- Don't sit here.

2340
01:14:19,520 --> 01:14:21,410
So Min, you lost a lot earlier.

2341
01:14:21,410 --> 01:14:22,690
- I'll give you two.
- Okay.

2342
01:14:22,690 --> 01:14:23,790
(He steals 2 from Se Chan.)

2343
01:14:23,790 --> 01:14:25,950
- This is the fee to help people.
- How many do you want?

2344
01:14:25,950 --> 01:14:27,830
- Give me two.
- Since when did we have fees?

2345
01:14:28,880 --> 01:14:30,730
- Give me two.
- I'm telling you.

2346
01:14:30,790 --> 01:14:33,030
If I give you two,
and you go sit there...

2347
01:14:33,030 --> 01:14:34,990
I won't sit there. Don't worry.

2348
01:14:35,290 --> 01:14:37,400
- He's a gangster.
- I won't sit there.

2349
01:14:37,400 --> 01:14:39,130
- Don't worry.
- Really?

2350
01:14:40,330 --> 01:14:42,200
My gosh. Goodness.

2351
01:14:43,480 --> 01:14:44,610
Okay.

2352
01:14:45,040 --> 01:14:46,950
- What?
- Okay.

2353
01:14:47,000 --> 01:14:49,120
(He naturally walks over
to the cards.)

2354
01:14:49,710 --> 01:14:50,950
(You said you wouldn't sit down!)

2355
01:14:50,950 --> 01:14:52,990
- Don't sit down.
- I'll pay you back after I win.

2356
01:14:53,040 --> 01:14:54,190
I'll pay you back after I win.

2357
01:14:54,190 --> 01:14:56,020
- Pull yourself together.
- What is he doing?

2358
01:14:56,020 --> 01:14:57,450
- Go away!
- What are you saying?

2359
01:14:57,450 --> 01:14:58,750
Go away.

2360
01:14:58,750 --> 01:15:01,160
- What's wrong with him?
- Do you think you can do that?

2361
01:15:01,160 --> 01:15:02,590
We don't trust you.

2362
01:15:02,920 --> 01:15:04,550
- Get over here.
- Sit over here.

2363
01:15:05,200 --> 01:15:06,730
- My goodness.
- This is hilarious.

2364
01:15:06,730 --> 01:15:08,620
- This is fun.
- Should we choose our cards?

2365
01:15:08,620 --> 01:15:09,940
(The remaining 3 players
start their game.)

2366
01:15:10,700 --> 01:15:13,270
- It was so funny how he sat there.
- What's your number?

2367
01:15:13,270 --> 01:15:15,040
(Ji Hyo 4, Suk Jin 10, Haha 1)

2368
01:15:15,040 --> 01:15:16,040
Okay.

2369
01:15:16,040 --> 01:15:17,170
I fold.

2370
01:15:17,300 --> 01:15:18,440
Really?

2371
01:15:18,440 --> 01:15:19,500
Here's one,

2372
01:15:20,200 --> 01:15:21,240
and I'll go all in.

2373
01:15:21,240 --> 01:15:22,280
(All in)

2374
01:15:22,950 --> 01:15:24,020
I'll go all in.

2375
01:15:24,120 --> 01:15:26,210
I'm sorry, but did you just put it
into Jae Suk's name?

2376
01:15:27,040 --> 01:15:28,620
- He put it in Jae Suk's.
- It's over.

2377
01:15:28,620 --> 01:15:29,860
He put it in Jae Suk's.

2378
01:15:29,860 --> 01:15:30,860
It's mine.

2379
01:15:32,530 --> 01:15:34,860
- This is mine.
- Put it down.

2380
01:15:34,860 --> 01:15:37,700
(An unexpected fortune
gifted by Big Nose)

2381
01:15:37,700 --> 01:15:39,290
Why would you put it into
Jae Suk's name?

2382
01:15:39,290 --> 01:15:40,370
No.

2383
01:15:40,530 --> 01:15:41,920
I'm telling you that it's mine.

2384
01:15:41,920 --> 01:15:43,900
- Why would you put it in there?
- Hey! Give it back!

2385
01:15:44,200 --> 01:15:45,290
Give it back.

2386
01:15:45,290 --> 01:15:46,410
It's Jae Suk's now.

2387
01:15:46,460 --> 01:15:47,940
- Why would you put it in there?
- Hey!

2388
01:15:47,940 --> 01:15:49,910
- Why are you doing this?
- You put it in my name.

2389
01:15:49,980 --> 01:15:52,800
- Hey! It's not yours.
- It's mine now.

2390
01:15:52,980 --> 01:15:54,740
- Give it back.
- Everyone's name is written on it.

2391
01:15:54,740 --> 01:15:55,980
- Right.
- Why did you put it in my name?

2392
01:15:55,980 --> 01:15:57,410
Why would you put it in his name?

2393
01:15:57,410 --> 01:15:59,450
How much is he giving
for his association fee?

2394
01:15:59,450 --> 01:16:01,340
- All of it is...
- How many did you take?

2395
01:16:01,340 --> 01:16:04,620
- I don't know.
- Put it back. There's 25 or 26.

2396
01:16:04,620 --> 01:16:06,290
- It wasn't that many.
- What are you saying?

2397
01:16:06,290 --> 01:16:07,880
Are you playing games, you punk?

2398
01:16:07,880 --> 01:16:08,920
(He lost his temper.)

2399
01:16:09,290 --> 01:16:10,530
Why are you cursing at me?

2400
01:16:10,530 --> 01:16:11,790
What is this?

2401
01:16:11,790 --> 01:16:13,200
You're the one who put it in.

2402
01:16:13,200 --> 01:16:14,590
You put it in under my name.

2403
01:16:14,590 --> 01:16:16,490
- It's mine.
- You're not playing this round!

2404
01:16:16,490 --> 01:16:17,590
That punk.

2405
01:16:17,590 --> 01:16:19,440
(He lost his temper
and is using foul language.)

2406
01:16:19,700 --> 01:16:20,770
Bring it back.

2407
01:16:20,770 --> 01:16:22,670
(They're starting to
chase each other again.)

2408
01:16:22,670 --> 01:16:24,740
(They go around and around.)

2409
01:16:25,080 --> 01:16:26,450
We're supposed to play like this?

2410
01:16:27,610 --> 01:16:29,620
- What is this?
- What are those two doing?

2411
01:16:29,620 --> 01:16:32,170
- Okay.
- Are you playing Duck, Duck, Goose?

2412
01:16:32,910 --> 01:16:35,150
Then give me 10, and we'll end this.

2413
01:16:36,580 --> 01:16:38,750
- Just give me 10.
- Sit down.

2414
01:16:38,750 --> 01:16:40,450
Just give me 10, and let's end this.

2415
01:16:40,450 --> 01:16:42,250
2, 4, 6, 7.

2416
01:16:42,250 --> 01:16:43,750
Did he get more?

2417
01:16:44,090 --> 01:16:45,620
Why would he put it in my name?

2418
01:16:45,620 --> 01:16:46,920
- Okay. Give me one.
- This is...

2419
01:16:46,920 --> 01:16:48,090
- Give me one.
- My gosh.

2420
01:16:48,090 --> 01:16:50,040
You found out because
I said something. Give me one.

2421
01:16:50,130 --> 01:16:52,490
My gosh,
there are a lot of pests here.

2422
01:16:53,440 --> 01:16:54,570
Okay, let's start.

2423
01:16:54,570 --> 01:16:56,700
2, 4, 6, 8, 10.

2424
01:16:56,780 --> 01:16:58,370
2, 4, 6, 8, 10.

2425
01:16:58,370 --> 01:16:59,650
- It's 20, exactly.
- 20?

2426
01:16:59,650 --> 01:17:01,240
- Make 20. You need 18.
- That's a lot.

2427
01:17:01,240 --> 01:17:03,450
(He intends to make up for it
with this.)

2428
01:17:03,450 --> 01:17:04,520
I fold.

2429
01:17:04,520 --> 01:17:06,710
(He doesn't think twice.)

2430
01:17:07,690 --> 01:17:10,020
(This wasn't my intention.)

2431
01:17:10,820 --> 01:17:13,250
(Suk Jin's plan
goes down the drain.)

2432
01:17:13,250 --> 01:17:15,330
- Hurry up, Ji Hyo.
- I folded already.

2433
01:17:15,330 --> 01:17:16,590
- I folded earlier.
- Everyone folded.

2434
01:17:16,590 --> 01:17:18,700
- Just play!
- I folded.

2435
01:17:18,700 --> 01:17:20,870
- Hurry up.
- I folded earlier.

2436
01:17:20,870 --> 01:17:22,230
Why did this happen to Suk Jin?

2437
01:17:22,230 --> 01:17:23,400
- What is it?
- He won.

2438
01:17:23,400 --> 01:17:25,130
(I had "10"?)

2439
01:17:25,200 --> 01:17:27,000
So does that mean
he only got two?

2440
01:17:27,000 --> 01:17:28,300
This is weird.

2441
01:17:28,300 --> 01:17:31,700
- I won, but I have fewer caramels.
- He lost 15 and won 2.

2442
01:17:31,700 --> 01:17:33,170
- He lost 15.
- He lost in this round.

2443
01:17:33,170 --> 01:17:34,200
I lost.

2444
01:17:34,200 --> 01:17:35,650
Okay.

2445
01:17:35,700 --> 01:17:36,710
You!

2446
01:17:36,870 --> 01:17:38,080
This is chaos.

2447
01:17:38,080 --> 01:17:39,790
- Can he play this round?
- He did well.

2448
01:17:40,190 --> 01:17:42,580
I still have my name on the box.
Why can't I play?

2449
01:17:42,750 --> 01:17:45,950
I think you'll end up coming right
back out, so just play.

2450
01:17:46,030 --> 01:17:47,250
- I...
- You can play.

2451
01:17:47,250 --> 01:17:49,030
got sponsored by a benefactor...

2452
01:17:49,190 --> 01:17:51,400
and got the chance to sit
in this seat again.

2453
01:17:51,400 --> 01:17:53,530
You're really good
at raising the stakes.

2454
01:17:54,730 --> 01:17:56,590
- I'll just go for it.
- Are you all in?

2455
01:17:56,590 --> 01:17:57,990
- I'm all in.
- Me too.

2456
01:17:58,200 --> 01:17:59,610
- Let's do it.
- I'm all in too.

2457
01:17:59,610 --> 01:18:01,200
(Jae Suk 2, Ji Hyo 5)

2458
01:18:01,200 --> 01:18:02,610
- The two of you...
- Ji Hyo.

2459
01:18:02,610 --> 01:18:04,410
- Shall we choose our cards?
- My goodness.

2460
01:18:04,410 --> 01:18:05,480
(Suk Jin 1, Haha 2)

2461
01:18:05,480 --> 01:18:06,610
Okay. We chose our cards.

2462
01:18:06,610 --> 01:18:07,610
(They're done choosing
their blue cards.)

2463
01:18:07,610 --> 01:18:09,200
Let's start with one.

2464
01:18:09,200 --> 01:18:10,210
(Suk Jin submitted 1 caramel.)

2465
01:18:10,710 --> 01:18:11,820
I call...

2466
01:18:11,820 --> 01:18:12,840
(He has a lot of caramels.)

2467
01:18:12,840 --> 01:18:13,910
one.

2468
01:18:15,520 --> 01:18:16,990
Haha has a lot.

2469
01:18:16,990 --> 01:18:21,050
- He really has a lot.
- 2, 4, 6, 8, 10. I raise 10.

2470
01:18:21,690 --> 01:18:24,030
Okay. The stakes are going up.

2471
01:18:24,160 --> 01:18:25,330
- Okay.
- Ji Hyo.

2472
01:18:25,330 --> 01:18:27,400
(To continue playing, Ji Hyo
must put out more than 11 caramels.)

2473
01:18:28,290 --> 01:18:29,490
11?

2474
01:18:29,990 --> 01:18:31,200
There she goes.

2475
01:18:31,200 --> 01:18:33,130
- Ji Hyo, are you going in?
- Is it 10 or 11?

2476
01:18:33,130 --> 01:18:34,830
- It's 11?
- Is Ji Hyo going in?

2477
01:18:35,800 --> 01:18:36,830
11.

2478
01:18:37,500 --> 01:18:38,830
- Shall I put in 11 caramels?
- Go ahead.

2479
01:18:38,830 --> 01:18:39,840
Yes.

2480
01:18:44,710 --> 01:18:45,780
I'll fold.

2481
01:18:46,490 --> 01:18:48,320
What? You just counted
your caramels.

2482
01:18:48,740 --> 01:18:50,820
- Ji Hyo.
- Are you kidding me?

2483
01:18:51,160 --> 01:18:53,660
It's my choice.
That's what I want to do.

2484
01:18:53,660 --> 01:18:55,550
We had to wait
while you counted your caramels.

2485
01:18:55,550 --> 01:18:57,250
She asked Jae Suk
to leave her out earlier.

2486
01:18:57,250 --> 01:18:58,860
I guess she really meant it.

2487
01:18:58,950 --> 01:19:00,030
Let's see.

2488
01:19:00,030 --> 01:19:01,590
- Let's see how it goes.
- This is...

2489
01:19:01,870 --> 01:19:03,270
Let me see.

2490
01:19:03,270 --> 01:19:04,460
This is really...

2491
01:19:04,460 --> 01:19:06,500
These are 11 caramels.

2492
01:19:06,740 --> 01:19:08,270
(He puts in 11 caramels.)

2493
01:19:08,270 --> 01:19:09,500
And three more.

2494
01:19:10,240 --> 01:19:11,610
- Is that it?
- What?

2495
01:19:11,630 --> 01:19:14,370
Hang on. I want
the three of you to stop...

2496
01:19:14,370 --> 01:19:16,540
- trying to sound so cool.
- I agree.

2497
01:19:17,150 --> 01:19:19,490
I'm sorry, but you're
just throwing in caramels now.

2498
01:19:19,490 --> 01:19:21,690
If you have more caramels
in your bag, just take them out.

2499
01:19:21,690 --> 01:19:23,120
(They sound like real card sharks.)

2500
01:19:23,120 --> 01:19:24,210
All right. I call three.

2501
01:19:24,210 --> 01:19:25,790
Suk Jin, why are you blushing?

2502
01:19:25,790 --> 01:19:27,230
Why is your face so red?

2503
01:19:27,230 --> 01:19:29,290
I'm still upset
with what happened earlier.

2504
01:19:30,050 --> 01:19:31,330
I'll fold.

2505
01:19:32,590 --> 01:19:34,270
Can I put in another three caramels?

2506
01:19:34,270 --> 01:19:36,290
- It's over. He's done.
- Okay.

2507
01:19:36,700 --> 01:19:37,940
- Let's go.
- What is it?

2508
01:19:37,940 --> 01:19:39,240
These two have nothing,
and they're acting cool.

2509
01:19:39,240 --> 01:19:40,630
- I'll take this off.
- Okay.

2510
01:19:40,770 --> 01:19:42,300
- I'm taking this off.
- Go ahead.

2511
01:19:42,940 --> 01:19:44,370
You two should take it off.

2512
01:19:44,370 --> 01:19:46,200
- One.
- Do it at the same time.

2513
01:19:46,200 --> 01:19:47,650
(Shocked)

2514
01:19:48,610 --> 01:19:51,340
The card in your hand
will decide the winner.

2515
01:19:51,840 --> 01:19:54,340
1, 2, 3.

2516
01:19:54,340 --> 01:19:56,210
(Who will be winning?)

2517
01:19:56,380 --> 01:19:57,380
Three.

2518
01:19:57,860 --> 01:19:59,660
(Jae Suk's blue card is 2.)

2519
01:19:59,660 --> 01:20:02,230
(Haha's blue card is 5.)

2520
01:20:03,200 --> 01:20:04,590
(Haha wins.)

2521
01:20:04,590 --> 01:20:05,700
- It's done.
- What?

2522
01:20:05,700 --> 01:20:07,160
- Hey.
- I beat Jae Suk.

2523
01:20:07,160 --> 01:20:09,370
Come here.

2524
01:20:10,370 --> 01:20:12,700
I told you not to come.

2525
01:20:13,370 --> 01:20:14,370
Sprinkle salt on him.

2526
01:20:14,370 --> 01:20:16,070
Sprinkle caramels on him.

2527
01:20:16,200 --> 01:20:18,130
- Don't come again.
- My gosh.

2528
01:20:18,130 --> 01:20:20,500
- You're bankrupt again.
- It's a dirty world.

2529
01:20:20,500 --> 01:20:22,040
- Okay?
- Don't give him any money.

2530
01:20:22,040 --> 01:20:23,670
- It's a dirty world.
- Pull yourself together.

2531
01:20:23,670 --> 01:20:25,870
- Put it together.
- My goodness.

2532
01:20:25,870 --> 01:20:27,040
Get out of here, you punk.

2533
01:20:27,040 --> 01:20:29,380
- Jae Suk.
- I'll call the police.

2534
01:20:29,520 --> 01:20:30,520
Why?

2535
01:20:30,520 --> 01:20:31,860
Why would you call the police?

2536
01:20:31,860 --> 01:20:32,860
I'll report you to the police.

2537
01:20:32,860 --> 01:20:34,830
This is a healthy card game.

2538
01:20:35,030 --> 01:20:36,120
- All right.
- You guys.

2539
01:20:36,120 --> 01:20:37,860
We're using caramels.
Why would you call the police?

2540
01:20:37,860 --> 01:20:40,370
The third mission
has come to an end.

2541
01:20:41,230 --> 01:20:43,900
Please count your caramels now.

2542
01:20:44,090 --> 01:20:45,770
I have three.

2543
01:20:46,740 --> 01:20:48,370
- What?
- I will...

2544
01:20:48,370 --> 01:20:51,370
get back on my feet with these.

2545
01:20:51,370 --> 01:20:52,410
My gosh.

2546
01:20:53,000 --> 01:20:56,150
You get 10 cents per caramel.

2547
01:20:56,370 --> 01:20:57,780
So Jae Suk gets 30 cents.

2548
01:20:57,780 --> 01:20:59,150
(Jae Suk gets 30 cents
for the next week's mission.)

2549
01:20:59,150 --> 01:21:01,120
- Only 30 cents?
- 30 cents!

2550
01:21:01,120 --> 01:21:03,860
(The tragic end with 30 cents
will be revealed next week.)

2551
01:21:03,860 --> 01:21:06,250
(Here are the guests who will
join Jae Suk with 30 cents.)

2552
01:21:06,690 --> 01:21:08,860
(Soyou, Jang Won Young of IZ ONE,
YUQI of (G)I-DLE)

2553
01:21:08,860 --> 01:21:11,030
(Kim Do Yeon of Weki Meki,
Mi Joo of Lovelyz)

2554
01:21:11,030 --> 01:21:12,050
(And...)

2555
01:21:12,050 --> 01:21:13,460
(Kim Dong Jun)

2556
01:21:13,460 --> 01:21:14,660
(There's a girl...)

2557
01:21:14,660 --> 01:21:16,330
(who smiles broadly
with all her heart.)

2558
01:21:17,090 --> 01:21:18,130
(It's a capitalistic race
with partners...)

2559
01:21:18,130 --> 01:21:19,660
(where they have to follow money.)

2560
01:21:19,660 --> 01:21:21,240
(The dice is cast.)

2561
01:21:22,040 --> 01:21:23,740
(They're ready to do anything...)

2562
01:21:23,740 --> 01:21:26,840
(to get more money.)

2563
01:21:27,780 --> 01:21:30,650
(The aftereffect of the betting
isn't over yet.)

2564
01:21:32,150 --> 01:21:34,150
(It's a war with deep-fried squid.)

2565
01:21:34,380 --> 01:21:35,690
(They can be happy only with money.)

2566
01:21:35,690 --> 01:21:37,550
(How would the race
with partners end?)

2567
01:21:37,910 --> 01:21:40,250
(Capitalistic Race with Partners,
Don't Worry, Be Happy)
