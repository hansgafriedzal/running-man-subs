1
00:00:05,750 --> 00:00:07,020
Please clap the slate once.

2
00:00:07,020 --> 00:00:09,720
- One...
- Shall we begin?

3
00:00:09,720 --> 00:00:10,890
- Do I clap it now?
- Yes.

4
00:00:11,220 --> 00:00:12,760
1, 2, and 3.

5
00:00:12,760 --> 00:00:14,060
(She claps her hands once.)

6
00:00:14,060 --> 00:00:15,800
Hello, everyone.

7
00:00:15,800 --> 00:00:16,920
(Then she starts hosting the show.)

8
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:20,200
Hello, everyone. Welcome
to Jeon So Min's Running Man.

9
00:00:21,120 --> 00:00:24,940
All right. We're going to have
five male guests today.

10
00:00:25,030 --> 00:00:26,210
Well...

11
00:00:26,530 --> 00:00:30,710
Today's special is
Win Over Jeon So Min Race.

12
00:00:30,710 --> 00:00:32,170
(She comes up with her own race.)

13
00:00:33,010 --> 00:00:35,050
Which one of the handsome guests...

14
00:00:35,050 --> 00:00:38,480
will be falling in love with
this beautiful woman, Jeon So Min?

15
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:41,980
Please look forward
to the exciting couple race.

16
00:00:41,980 --> 00:00:44,550
Director, please follow me.

17
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:47,690
(Host Jeon has a lot of requests
for her show.)

18
00:00:48,650 --> 00:00:49,800
(Just about when she finally runs
out of ideas for her show...)

19
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:51,190
Hurry, Yoo Jae Suk.

20
00:00:51,260 --> 00:00:52,370
Let's start right away.

21
00:00:52,470 --> 00:00:53,690
When we worked out the day before...

22
00:00:53,690 --> 00:00:55,000
Hello.

23
00:00:55,130 --> 00:00:56,130
- Hello.
- Hello.

24
00:00:56,130 --> 00:00:57,230
What are you doing here alone?

25
00:00:57,230 --> 00:00:58,570
- I was busy working.
- Hello.

26
00:00:58,570 --> 00:00:59,940
- I was working.
- You came early.

27
00:00:59,940 --> 00:01:00,970
- You were?
- Okay.

28
00:01:00,970 --> 00:01:02,180
Hello.

29
00:01:02,180 --> 00:01:06,180
After the shooting yesterday,
I talked to Kwang Soo.

30
00:01:06,180 --> 00:01:07,580
Apparently, he was
very disappointed.

31
00:01:07,580 --> 00:01:09,020
- Why?
- Hey.

32
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:10,240
- Don't do that.
- I mean...

33
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:11,540
- Why were you disappointed?
- Well...

34
00:01:11,540 --> 00:01:12,990
- Nothing.
- The thing is,

35
00:01:12,990 --> 00:01:15,580
- July 14 was Kwang Soo's birthday.
- Hey.

36
00:01:15,580 --> 00:01:16,710
- Right.
- It was your birthday?

37
00:01:16,710 --> 00:01:20,260
And the episode we filmed
would be aired around that day.

38
00:01:20,290 --> 00:01:23,460
So he thought we prepared
some prank for him.

39
00:01:23,460 --> 00:01:24,460
(He thought we prepared
some prank for him.)

40
00:01:24,460 --> 00:01:26,160
(Kwang Soo counted
his chickens too soon.)

41
00:01:26,160 --> 00:01:27,270
- But...
- That's not true.

42
00:01:27,270 --> 00:01:28,460
- No, it's not like that.
- Nothing happened, so...

43
00:01:28,460 --> 00:01:29,960
It was nothing like that!

44
00:01:29,960 --> 00:01:32,800
- Kwang Soo was...
- No, that's not true.

45
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:34,070
(The members didn't plan
anything for Kwang Soo's birthday.)

46
00:01:34,070 --> 00:01:35,270
So when I was wearing the blindfold,

47
00:01:35,270 --> 00:01:37,800
I thought you guys would
do something to me.

48
00:01:39,010 --> 00:01:40,600
(When he was told
to put on the blindfold...)

49
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:42,680
(Maybe this is some kind of prank.)

50
00:01:43,180 --> 00:01:45,540
(Nothing ever happened.)

51
00:01:46,120 --> 00:01:48,080
(This is a little too rough
for my birthday party.)

52
00:01:48,910 --> 00:01:50,410
- Did you expect something?
- Not really. Se Chan...

53
00:01:50,410 --> 00:01:51,520
I had no idea.

54
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:54,680
The day before, he asked, "We should
dress like card sharks tomorrow."

55
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:56,550
"Do you know what it is about?"

56
00:01:56,990 --> 00:01:58,460
- "Am I the main star tomorrow?"
- "A card shark?"

57
00:01:58,790 --> 00:02:01,270
"Hang on. The episode
will be aired around..."

58
00:02:02,190 --> 00:02:04,570
"Maybe Se Chan is not
supposed to tell me that."

59
00:02:04,570 --> 00:02:07,070
(Kwang Soo thought
Se Chan made a mistake.)

60
00:02:07,270 --> 00:02:09,710
"Isn't he supposed
to keep it a secret?"

61
00:02:09,710 --> 00:02:11,430
- Because I didn't hear it.
- He was in the movie, "Tazza".

62
00:02:11,430 --> 00:02:12,540
- Right.
- That's what it is.

63
00:02:12,540 --> 00:02:16,480
"Hang on. The show will be aired
the day after my birthday."

64
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:18,640
(Gosh, I know what is going on.)

65
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:19,880
That's ridiculous.

66
00:02:19,880 --> 00:02:21,290
So during the shooting,

67
00:02:21,290 --> 00:02:23,610
I kept looking for cameras.
I was sure something would happen.

68
00:02:23,610 --> 00:02:24,720
Are you the only one
who has a birthday?

69
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:25,760
That's not it.

70
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:26,880
- Are you the only one?
- That's not it.

71
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:28,500
We should prepare
a surprise for him.

72
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:30,760
- He was counting on it.
- We had no idea.

73
00:02:30,760 --> 00:02:32,030
Today,

74
00:02:32,500 --> 00:02:35,440
you're going to compete in pairs.

75
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:36,500
- Oh, my.
- In pairs?

76
00:02:36,500 --> 00:02:39,260
By the way, the caramels...

77
00:02:39,860 --> 00:02:41,700
- Based on yesterday's results...
- He has only three.

78
00:02:41,700 --> 00:02:43,070
- What can I do with 30 cents?
- You'll get 30 cents, and...

79
00:02:43,070 --> 00:02:44,130
(Why does Jae Suk
look so depressed?)

80
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:46,040
(In War of Sharks last week,)

81
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:47,540
(he raised the stakes
as the chairman.)

82
00:02:48,100 --> 00:02:51,070
(He soon went broke
and was thrown onto the floor.)

83
00:02:51,980 --> 00:02:53,350
(Having only 3 caramels left,)

84
00:02:53,350 --> 00:02:54,720
(he'll be given 30 cents
as his mission fund.)

85
00:02:55,110 --> 00:02:56,610
(Current Number of Caramels)

86
00:02:56,610 --> 00:02:58,010
(Jong Kook: 6.8 dollars,
Suk Jin and Haha: 5.4 dollars,)

87
00:02:58,010 --> 00:02:59,290
(Kwang Soo 4.9 dollars,
Se Chan: 4.8 dollars)

88
00:02:59,730 --> 00:03:01,160
After yesterday's shoot,

89
00:03:01,160 --> 00:03:02,950
I was given a huge bag of caramels.

90
00:03:02,950 --> 00:03:04,600
- That's all you get?
- I'm sick of it.

91
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:05,860
I don't want any more caramels.

92
00:03:05,860 --> 00:03:08,030
- I even found one in my sock...
- Be quiet.

93
00:03:08,030 --> 00:03:09,070
Hey!

94
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:11,390
Be quiet.

95
00:03:11,390 --> 00:03:14,040
- The director is talking.
- I never get to talk.

96
00:03:14,260 --> 00:03:15,510
You know what?

97
00:03:15,510 --> 00:03:18,340
- What?
- There's a compilation...

98
00:03:18,340 --> 00:03:19,600
of you interrupting him
on the internet.

99
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:21,600
- Really?
- When it's all put together,

100
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:22,910
it's almost 15 minutes long.

101
00:03:22,910 --> 00:03:25,140
For 15 minutes, he interrupts...
Think about it.

102
00:03:25,140 --> 00:03:26,250
- I mean...
- Really?

103
00:03:26,250 --> 00:03:28,250
What just happened
isn't even a minute long.

104
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:30,510
- I never get to tell stories.
- There's a compilation of it.

105
00:03:30,510 --> 00:03:33,090
- Cut it out.
- I'm wearing this for the opening.

106
00:03:33,090 --> 00:03:36,290
Please welcome your partners
for today.

107
00:03:36,530 --> 00:03:37,850
We're excited to have guests.

108
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:40,730
- Oh, my.
- Oh, hey.

109
00:03:41,420 --> 00:03:43,890
- Oh, my.
- Oh, hey.

110
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,570
- What are you doing here?
- You're finally here.

111
00:03:45,730 --> 00:03:47,100
- Hi, Soyou.
- Welcome.

112
00:03:47,100 --> 00:03:48,980
(Soyou, Doyeon of Weki Meki,
and Mijoo of Lovelyz)

113
00:03:49,910 --> 00:03:52,250
(And they're followed by...)

114
00:03:53,100 --> 00:03:55,440
(Yuqi of (G)I-DLE
and Won Young of IZ ONE)

115
00:03:55,610 --> 00:03:56,980
- Hi, Doyeon.
- Hi.

116
00:03:56,980 --> 00:03:58,480
- Hi.
- Hi.

117
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:00,590
(Everyone is busy
greeting each other.)

118
00:04:00,590 --> 00:04:02,950
- Hi.
- Oh, hi.

119
00:04:02,950 --> 00:04:04,060
(So Min looks around.)

120
00:04:04,060 --> 00:04:06,320
(Do we have any male guests?)

121
00:04:06,320 --> 00:04:08,160
- Won Young, you're here.
- You're tall.

122
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:10,060
- Who?
- Won Young...

123
00:04:10,060 --> 00:04:12,570
- She's really tall.
- She's so tall.

124
00:04:12,570 --> 00:04:14,100
We were just talking about
how tall she's become.

125
00:04:14,100 --> 00:04:15,840
I was so surprised.
She's become even taller.

126
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:16,970
Everyone is avoiding her.

127
00:04:16,970 --> 00:04:18,540
We have one more guest.

128
00:04:18,540 --> 00:04:19,970
- Let's welcome the last guest.
- There's one more?

129
00:04:19,970 --> 00:04:22,100
- Yes.
- Please come out.

130
00:04:22,100 --> 00:04:23,140
(Who is the last guest?)

131
00:04:23,140 --> 00:04:24,430
- Who could it be?
- What's going on?

132
00:04:24,430 --> 00:04:26,210
- Oh, my. It's Dong Jun.
- Dong Jun.

133
00:04:26,300 --> 00:04:28,870
- It's Dong Jun.
- Hey, Dong Jun.

134
00:04:29,020 --> 00:04:30,720
- Dong Jun.
- Look who's here.

135
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:32,290
- How have you been?
- Hi.

136
00:04:33,540 --> 00:04:35,980
(They seem really happy.)

137
00:04:36,550 --> 00:04:38,480
(So Min has mentioned many times...)

138
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:40,390
(that she likes guys like Dong Jun.)

139
00:04:40,620 --> 00:04:43,460
("After Effect" starts playing.)

140
00:04:43,460 --> 00:04:44,620
- It's automatic.
- <i>I keep feeling sad</i>

141
00:04:44,990 --> 00:04:46,790
- So Min is finally smiling.
- You look so manly now.

142
00:04:46,790 --> 00:04:48,470
So Min is finally smiling big.

143
00:04:48,730 --> 00:04:50,040
- She's finally smiling.
- He looks so manly.

144
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:51,290
- Hi.
- Hi.

145
00:04:51,490 --> 00:04:54,160
- What's with So Min?
- She's getting her hopes up again.

146
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:55,800
- It happens every week.
- She's tucking her hair back.

147
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:57,930
- She never gives up.
- Good. Go for it.

148
00:04:57,930 --> 00:04:59,240
- No.
- Your ears will start bleeding.

149
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:00,500
(She can't even look at Dong Jun.)

150
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:02,670
- What's with So Min?
- What's with her?

151
00:05:02,980 --> 00:05:04,080
All right.

152
00:05:04,650 --> 00:05:06,410
Let me introduce our guests
one by one.

153
00:05:06,410 --> 00:05:08,310
- First, Kim Dong Jun.
- Dong Jun.

154
00:05:08,890 --> 00:05:09,980
- Hello.
- Yes!

155
00:05:09,980 --> 00:05:12,160
- Yes!
- He's so good-looking.

156
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:13,180
(They welcome him enthusiastically.)

157
00:05:13,180 --> 00:05:15,460
Back in 2015... That was long ago.

158
00:05:15,460 --> 00:05:16,730
- It's been 5 years.
- It's been 5 years.

159
00:05:16,730 --> 00:05:19,060
Last time, I appeared
together with SHINHWA.

160
00:05:19,060 --> 00:05:21,030
- That's right.
- We went to the beach, right?

161
00:05:21,030 --> 00:05:24,040
(While Dong Jun's interview
is going on...)

162
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:26,300
- He's so good-looking.
- We went to the beach, right?

163
00:05:26,300 --> 00:05:27,410
(Se Chan laughs.)

164
00:05:27,410 --> 00:05:29,300
What? Do you have a problem?

165
00:05:29,300 --> 00:05:30,480
What's wrong?

166
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:33,280
- She says he's good-looking.
- She says, "He's so good-looking."

167
00:05:33,670 --> 00:05:35,370
Stop it now.

168
00:05:35,370 --> 00:05:36,610
- That's why it never works out.
- I never did that.

169
00:05:36,610 --> 00:05:38,220
You said he's good-looking.
It's been recorded.

170
00:05:38,220 --> 00:05:40,310
- She can't even look at him.
- Hold on. So Min, you should move.

171
00:05:40,890 --> 00:05:42,350
- This is not okay. Come here.
- Switch with Ji Hyo.

172
00:05:42,350 --> 00:05:43,960
- No! I don't want to.
- Go over there.

173
00:05:43,960 --> 00:05:45,850
- I don't want to!
- Switch with her.

174
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:47,230
- <i>Tears keep falling</i>
- Go over there.

175
00:05:47,230 --> 00:05:48,900
(She is sent away from Dong Jun.)

176
00:05:49,050 --> 00:05:50,050
Okay.

177
00:05:50,050 --> 00:05:54,770
Anyway, Dong Jun, is there anyone
you want to be partners with?

178
00:05:55,330 --> 00:05:56,840
- There is.
- Who?

179
00:05:56,840 --> 00:05:58,290
I've been curious about this person.

180
00:05:58,290 --> 00:05:59,500
- Who?
- Tell us.

181
00:06:00,140 --> 00:06:03,300
(There is someone
he's been curious about?)

182
00:06:03,300 --> 00:06:04,540
- Who?
- Who?

183
00:06:05,170 --> 00:06:07,740
- So Min.
- Oh, my.

184
00:06:07,740 --> 00:06:08,980
(So Min's heart skips a beat.)

185
00:06:08,980 --> 00:06:11,310
This is not good.
Why would you set her heart on fire?

186
00:06:11,650 --> 00:06:13,220
- He planned this.
- Why would you...

187
00:06:13,220 --> 00:06:14,850
- He planned this beforehand.
- What's with her?

188
00:06:15,090 --> 00:06:16,250
- Oh, my.
- "Set her heart on fire"?

189
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:18,550
You're going a bit too far there.

190
00:06:18,550 --> 00:06:20,730
- "Set her heart on fire"?
- "Set her heart on fire"?

191
00:06:20,730 --> 00:06:21,730
- Hey.
- That's exaggerated.

192
00:06:21,730 --> 00:06:23,050
- Why do you exaggerate so much?
- That's too dramatic.

193
00:06:23,050 --> 00:06:25,050
- Be quiet.
- Don't be so dramatic.

194
00:06:25,050 --> 00:06:27,900
- Anyway, he agrees.
- Don't exaggerate.

195
00:06:27,900 --> 00:06:29,270
Don't set her heart on fire.

196
00:06:29,270 --> 00:06:31,660
Don't say that if you don't mean it.
She's serious.

197
00:06:32,210 --> 00:06:33,930
I mean it. I've been really curious.

198
00:06:33,930 --> 00:06:36,000
But Dong Jun,
her boyfriend is right here.

199
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,980
- No.
- What are you talking about?

200
00:06:37,980 --> 00:06:40,210
- People keep asking me...
- It's not true.

201
00:06:40,210 --> 00:06:41,780
- <i>Tears keep falling</i>
- Seriously.

202
00:06:41,780 --> 00:06:42,910
- Jae Suk.
- People get the wrong idea.

203
00:06:42,910 --> 00:06:44,280
- What are you talking about?
- Se Chan is excited too.

204
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:45,680
- Really?
- You're right.

205
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:47,090
- I'm excited too.
- Look at him.

206
00:06:47,090 --> 00:06:49,480
He may not have a swim ring, but
he looks like he's on a vacation.

207
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:51,050
- I'm taking someone with me.
- Where's your swim ring?

208
00:06:51,050 --> 00:06:52,390
- I see.
- I'm going away today.

209
00:06:52,390 --> 00:06:53,790
He came prepared.

210
00:06:53,790 --> 00:06:55,460
- I can see it now.
- Yes.

211
00:06:55,460 --> 00:06:58,600
Next up is Won Young.

212
00:06:58,600 --> 00:07:01,770
By the way, I'm sorry to ask this,

213
00:07:02,100 --> 00:07:05,140
how much have you grown
in the past year?

214
00:07:05,140 --> 00:07:08,540
Since we last met,
I think I've grown...

215
00:07:08,540 --> 00:07:09,980
at least 2 or 3cm taller.

216
00:07:09,980 --> 00:07:11,430
- Right?
- So she's still growing.

217
00:07:11,430 --> 00:07:13,780
Jang Doyeon should be nervous now.

218
00:07:13,780 --> 00:07:15,910
- I'm getting nervous too...
- Be quiet.

219
00:07:15,910 --> 00:07:17,370
I'm nervous too!

220
00:07:18,310 --> 00:07:20,240
Don't I get a chance to talk
since they brought up Jang Doyeon?

221
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:21,310
Stop it.

222
00:07:21,310 --> 00:07:22,960
- After me...
- Stop it.

223
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:24,610
- During the opening...
- Won Young is talking.

224
00:07:24,610 --> 00:07:26,530
- Why do you cut in?
- You've interrupted him twice.

225
00:07:26,850 --> 00:07:28,290
- Jae Suk interrupts him again.
- Gosh.

226
00:07:28,290 --> 00:07:29,490
Stop it.

227
00:07:29,790 --> 00:07:32,830
Aren't you stressed out
about people asking you...

228
00:07:32,830 --> 00:07:35,400
about your height?

229
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:37,430
They do ask me a lot.

230
00:07:37,430 --> 00:07:40,470
I'm starting to get
a bit stressed out.

231
00:07:40,470 --> 00:07:42,870
What do they usually ask?

232
00:07:42,870 --> 00:07:45,430
First, "Are you still growing?"

233
00:07:45,430 --> 00:07:46,740
Second, "I think
you've grown taller."

234
00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:48,950
You just said both.

235
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:52,310
(Jae Suk said both today.)

236
00:07:52,310 --> 00:07:53,890
- Hey. You hurt her.
- I'm sorry.

237
00:07:53,890 --> 00:07:55,240
Why did you do that?

238
00:07:55,240 --> 00:07:56,460
- I...
- Why do you stress her out?

239
00:07:56,460 --> 00:07:59,120
- Seriously.
- I almost didn't recognize her.

240
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:00,920
Someone walked up to me
and greeted me.

241
00:08:00,920 --> 00:08:02,550
- So I said hello.
- That's right.

242
00:08:03,330 --> 00:08:04,460
Okay.

243
00:08:04,460 --> 00:08:07,730
She's so good
with her facial expressions.

244
00:08:07,900 --> 00:08:11,160
Apparently, she has some tips
about facial expressions on stage.

245
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:13,710
It's not easy
to depict the lyrics...

246
00:08:13,710 --> 00:08:15,140
- with your expressions.
- No.

247
00:08:15,140 --> 00:08:17,600
Is there anything you think
is the most important?

248
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:19,040
My part goes,

249
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:20,980
"Your magic wakes me up".

250
00:08:20,980 --> 00:08:23,810
If I do it the ordinary way...
Should I look in this direction?

251
00:08:23,810 --> 00:08:25,910
(This is how she practices
the ordinary way.)

252
00:08:25,910 --> 00:08:27,610
- Something like that.
- That's ordinary?

253
00:08:27,610 --> 00:08:29,110
- That's ordinary?
- That's supposed to be ordinary.

254
00:08:29,110 --> 00:08:30,350
Then please add more emotion.

255
00:08:30,350 --> 00:08:31,660
- And then...
- Do it your style.

256
00:08:31,660 --> 00:08:33,660
On stage, I'd do...

257
00:08:34,550 --> 00:08:37,060
(Your magic wakes me up)

258
00:08:37,060 --> 00:08:39,020
- It has much more emotion.
- She moves her eyebrows.

259
00:08:39,020 --> 00:08:40,700
- She moves her eyes a lot.
- She's really good.

260
00:08:40,700 --> 00:08:42,260
- It's not easy.
- She's so good.

261
00:08:42,260 --> 00:08:45,070
Jong Kook, what do you do
to covey the lyrics?

262
00:08:45,070 --> 00:08:46,760
- Try it.
- I don't...

263
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:48,400
My eyes are too small.
They can't express anything.

264
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:50,980
In the old days, the expressions
were not this detailed, right?

265
00:08:50,980 --> 00:08:52,870
This is all we did.

266
00:08:52,870 --> 00:08:56,610
(They didn't use
a lot of facial expressions.)

267
00:08:57,370 --> 00:08:59,140
(Regardless of the lyrics,
all the moves were exaggerated.)

268
00:08:59,140 --> 00:09:00,950
I don't know how many times
I did this.

269
00:09:01,280 --> 00:09:03,650
Why do you always kick
even when you're singing?

270
00:09:03,980 --> 00:09:06,250
- What's with you?
- I poked a lot too.

271
00:09:06,250 --> 00:09:07,520
But I didn't use
a lot of facial expressions.

272
00:09:08,150 --> 00:09:10,520
- Please give it up for Won Young.
- Thank you.

273
00:09:10,520 --> 00:09:11,600
Let's move on.

274
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:13,670
- Next up is... Oh, my.
- Who is it?

275
00:09:13,670 --> 00:09:15,020
This is her first time
on Running Man.

276
00:09:15,020 --> 00:09:17,730
- Yuqi.
- Oh, yes.

277
00:09:17,990 --> 00:09:19,810
- You're from China, right?
- Yes.

278
00:09:19,810 --> 00:09:22,680
This is your first time
on Running Man.

279
00:09:22,680 --> 00:09:24,180
How are you feeling?

280
00:09:24,180 --> 00:09:28,370
Yes, I've always wanted
to be on this show.

281
00:09:28,370 --> 00:09:30,740
Actually, I was a host
on Running Man China...

282
00:09:30,740 --> 00:09:33,110
last year.

283
00:09:33,110 --> 00:09:34,380
- Running Man China?
- That's right.

284
00:09:34,380 --> 00:09:36,690
- Running Man China?
- Yes.

285
00:09:36,690 --> 00:09:40,090
Apparently, Yuqi loves giraffes.

286
00:09:40,090 --> 00:09:42,190
- That's right.
- You actually love giraffes?

287
00:09:42,190 --> 00:09:43,390
He's getting excited.

288
00:09:43,390 --> 00:09:45,460
My dream used to be
riding on a giraffe.

289
00:09:45,460 --> 00:09:47,120
- Ride on it today.
- Ride on it.

290
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:49,230
- Try it.
- She means a real giraffe!

291
00:09:49,230 --> 00:09:50,490
- Ride on him.
- Why would she ride on me?

292
00:09:50,490 --> 00:09:51,800
- Get on the giraffe.
- She means a real giraffe!

293
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:53,070
- Just try it.
- You are a giraffe.

294
00:09:53,070 --> 00:09:55,340
- I mean...
- Hurry up and jump on him.

295
00:09:55,340 --> 00:09:57,000
- Wait.
- Kwang Soo.

296
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,630
- Even if I get down on all fours...
- Get on his back.

297
00:09:58,630 --> 00:10:00,100
- Not you.
- Why would you get on?

298
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:01,850
- You should stand up.
- Stand up.

299
00:10:01,850 --> 00:10:03,010
- The giraffe should stand up.
- Like this.

300
00:10:03,010 --> 00:10:05,050
Run around like a giraffe first.

301
00:10:05,050 --> 00:10:07,240
- Try walking.
- Why do I have to do this?

302
00:10:07,590 --> 00:10:10,320
- Why do I have to do this?
- For Yuqi...

303
00:10:10,780 --> 00:10:13,280
- Do it for Yuqi.
- A real giraffe is taller.

304
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:14,850
All right. You can get on
his back now.

305
00:10:14,850 --> 00:10:17,200
A little lower. There you go.

306
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:18,200
- Get on his back.
- Seriously?

307
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:19,800
Riding on a giraffe is her dream.

308
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:21,620
She got on my back for real?

309
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:23,600
(It's her very first ride
on a giraffe.)

310
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:25,360
- Giddy up!
- Run!

311
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:26,500
- Run!
- I mean...

312
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:27,670
- Give him the leaf.
- Run!

313
00:10:27,670 --> 00:10:28,980
- Here we go. Run!
- Let's go!

314
00:10:28,980 --> 00:10:31,770
The ground...
Her dream is riding on a giraffe.

315
00:10:31,770 --> 00:10:33,870
- Why would she get on my back?
- That's enough.

316
00:10:33,870 --> 00:10:35,580
- That's enough. Okay.
- Good job.

317
00:10:35,580 --> 00:10:36,820
- Her dream came true.
- Okay.

318
00:10:36,820 --> 00:10:38,610
- We're done.
- How are you feeling?

319
00:10:38,610 --> 00:10:39,820
- Yuqi's dream...
- How does it feel?

320
00:10:39,820 --> 00:10:41,920
- came true.
- Her dream came true.

321
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:42,980
Thank you.

322
00:10:42,980 --> 00:10:45,280
- We make your dream come true.
- Yuqi.

323
00:10:45,280 --> 00:10:47,350
Next up is Mijoo.

324
00:10:47,350 --> 00:10:50,250
- Yes!
- Mijoo!

325
00:10:50,250 --> 00:10:51,460
How are you doing these days?

326
00:10:51,460 --> 00:10:55,230
With the pandemic going on
much longer than expected,

327
00:10:55,230 --> 00:10:56,890
I guess it's hard to plan...

328
00:10:56,890 --> 00:10:58,490
new albums and everything.

329
00:10:58,490 --> 00:11:00,310
- That's right.
- Why is the question so hard?

330
00:11:00,900 --> 00:11:02,870
- Ask an easy one.
- I'm not an anchor or anything.

331
00:11:02,870 --> 00:11:05,370
My heart almost burst.

332
00:11:05,370 --> 00:11:06,850
- "What is he talking about?"
- What do you mean?

333
00:11:06,850 --> 00:11:08,480
- "How is she going to answer?"
- It's not that hard.

334
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:09,820
- I almost hit him with my elbow.
- Hey.

335
00:11:09,820 --> 00:11:11,610
All Yuqi did is get on a giraffe.

336
00:11:11,610 --> 00:11:13,590
- Why would you ask her...
- Mijoo...

337
00:11:13,590 --> 00:11:14,740
- about her future plans?
- About the pandemic.

338
00:11:14,740 --> 00:11:16,110
- She's been on the show a lot.
- It's a tough time.

339
00:11:16,110 --> 00:11:17,610
That's why I asked her
that question.

340
00:11:17,610 --> 00:11:20,330
After your appearance
on Running Man,

341
00:11:20,330 --> 00:11:22,230
did your mother say anything?

342
00:11:22,230 --> 00:11:23,330
- I got scolded a lot.
- Why?

343
00:11:23,330 --> 00:11:24,430
- Why?
- Why? You were the best!

344
00:11:24,430 --> 00:11:25,460
You did a good job.

345
00:11:25,460 --> 00:11:27,330
- She was the best.
- It was fun,

346
00:11:27,330 --> 00:11:28,970
- It was fun.
- but because I'm a girl...

347
00:11:28,970 --> 00:11:31,170
When my mom saw me
sitting like this, she said,

348
00:11:31,170 --> 00:11:33,600
"Are you crazy?
Why were you sitting like that?"

349
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:34,760
(Her mom scolded her
out of love.)

350
00:11:34,760 --> 00:11:37,230
"Why were you sitting like that?"

351
00:11:37,580 --> 00:11:38,630
She scolded me so much.

352
00:11:38,630 --> 00:11:40,080
Mijoo takes after her mother.

353
00:11:40,080 --> 00:11:41,900
"Why were you spreading
your legs like that?"

354
00:11:41,900 --> 00:11:43,480
- Mijoo is so funny.
- I love it.

355
00:11:43,480 --> 00:11:45,550
- She's very straightforward.
- She's very cool.

356
00:11:45,550 --> 00:11:46,880
- Seriously...
- Her mom is so cool.

357
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:48,140
Isn't she amazing?

358
00:11:48,140 --> 00:11:49,350
She said my face looked so big.

359
00:11:49,350 --> 00:11:51,590
Won Young is the one
panicking the most right now.

360
00:11:52,280 --> 00:11:53,620
- I'm sorry.
- Right?

361
00:11:53,980 --> 00:11:56,430
Mijoo is an idol group member too.

362
00:11:56,430 --> 00:11:58,600
- But she's so straightforward.
- Not all members are the same.

363
00:11:58,600 --> 00:11:59,600
- Of course.
- Of course.

364
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:02,120
Variety shows love
people like Mijoo.

365
00:12:02,390 --> 00:12:04,800
Won Young keeps giving her
a meaningless thumbs-up.

366
00:12:05,230 --> 00:12:06,730
- I mean...
- Why is she doing that?

367
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,530
Why are you doing that?

368
00:12:09,530 --> 00:12:10,580
All right.

369
00:12:10,580 --> 00:12:13,210
- Next up is Soyou.
- Soyou.

370
00:12:13,580 --> 00:12:14,980
It's been a while, Soyou.

371
00:12:14,980 --> 00:12:16,770
Her real name is Kang Ji Hyun.

372
00:12:16,770 --> 00:12:18,580
- How did you know?
- Really?

373
00:12:18,580 --> 00:12:21,090
Actually, this is what we say...

374
00:12:21,090 --> 00:12:22,280
- every summer.
- SISTAR?

375
00:12:22,280 --> 00:12:23,460
SISTAR is...

376
00:12:23,460 --> 00:12:24,820
- I know.
- That's true.

377
00:12:24,820 --> 00:12:26,730
We have no girl groups
for summer anymore.

378
00:12:27,280 --> 00:12:29,100
Do you still get that a lot?

379
00:12:29,350 --> 00:12:32,990
I do get that a lot.
So a new album is coming out.

380
00:12:32,990 --> 00:12:35,070
(I do get that a lot.
So a new album is coming out.)

381
00:12:35,070 --> 00:12:36,130
(Is SISTAR releasing a new album?)

382
00:12:36,130 --> 00:12:38,530
- Really?
- It's big news!

383
00:12:38,530 --> 00:12:39,600
Jae Suk.

384
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:40,840
- See?
- The three of you?

385
00:12:40,840 --> 00:12:43,030
- I'm doing it alone.
- Alone? Hang on.

386
00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:45,080
(What's wrong with you?
I'm doing it solo, not as SISTAR.)

387
00:12:45,080 --> 00:12:46,600
- Hey.
- You seem too disappointed.

388
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:48,850
Why did you talk about yourself
when we asked about SISTAR?

389
00:12:48,850 --> 00:12:50,450
- Suk Jin! Why are you doing this?
- I'm a member of SISTAR.

390
00:12:50,450 --> 00:12:52,140
- I know you're SISTAR, but we...
- Soyou.

391
00:12:52,140 --> 00:12:54,140
- I'm sorry about that.
- Please understand him.

392
00:12:54,140 --> 00:12:55,450
- I'm quite upset.
- You should understand him.

393
00:12:55,450 --> 00:12:56,780
I'm sorry about that.

394
00:12:56,780 --> 00:12:59,590
- But we were talking about...
- It's the flow of the conversation.

395
00:12:59,590 --> 00:13:01,780
It sounded like SISTAR was
going to release a new album.

396
00:13:01,780 --> 00:13:03,850
I misunderstood it as well.
I thought it was about SISTAR.

397
00:13:03,850 --> 00:13:06,070
- See?
- I'm sorry. It's my fault.

398
00:13:06,070 --> 00:13:07,600
So you're releasing
a new summer song.

399
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:10,070
Yes. It will be a cool summer song.

400
00:13:10,070 --> 00:13:13,070
As you just said,
your new summer song...

401
00:13:13,070 --> 00:13:15,000
- is coming out soon.
- Right.

402
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,310
We should hear it then.

403
00:13:16,310 --> 00:13:18,270
(Soyou's new song, "Gotta Go"
is coming out in two days.)

404
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:19,900
Soyou has a nice voice.

405
00:13:22,210 --> 00:13:23,820
(Surprised)

406
00:13:24,550 --> 00:13:26,420
("Gotto Go" by Soyou)

407
00:13:26,420 --> 00:13:27,720
This is it.

408
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:29,750
- It's summer.
- I love it!

409
00:13:29,750 --> 00:13:30,920
It sounds great
from the beginning.

410
00:13:35,690 --> 00:13:36,700
Let's go.

411
00:13:37,990 --> 00:13:39,020
It's nice.

412
00:13:40,570 --> 00:13:41,620
Head.

413
00:13:41,620 --> 00:13:45,260
(Head and shoulder)

414
00:13:47,860 --> 00:13:49,630
- Head.
- Shoulder.

415
00:13:49,870 --> 00:13:52,370
We need a song like this in summer.

416
00:13:53,050 --> 00:13:54,210
- All right.
- This is a summer song.

417
00:13:54,210 --> 00:13:55,500
Now it feels like summer.

418
00:13:55,500 --> 00:13:57,050
- It feels so cool.
- We definitely need this.

419
00:13:57,320 --> 00:13:58,740
- She's really good.
- It's really cool.

420
00:13:58,740 --> 00:13:59,820
She's different.

421
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:02,220
Now we have Doyeon here.

422
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:04,380
(Performance queen and characterful
actress, Doyeon of Weki Meki)

423
00:14:04,380 --> 00:14:06,430
We have Jang Doyeon for comedy.

424
00:14:06,430 --> 00:14:09,390
- And we have Kim Doyeon for K-pop.
- Right.

425
00:14:09,850 --> 00:14:11,600
How have you been, Doyeon?

426
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:14,170
I've been getting ready
for my new drama.

427
00:14:14,170 --> 00:14:15,300
- I see.
- You're starting a drama.

428
00:14:15,300 --> 00:14:16,730
She appeared in a drama before.

429
00:14:16,730 --> 00:14:18,490
- It was "Be Melodramatic".
- "Be Melodramatic".

430
00:14:18,860 --> 00:14:19,900
That's right.

431
00:14:19,900 --> 00:14:21,360
You watched the drama. You liked it.

432
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:22,730
- I did. I really liked it.
- You should say that.

433
00:14:22,730 --> 00:14:23,940
Aren't you going to work?

434
00:14:23,940 --> 00:14:25,180
No, that's not it.

435
00:14:25,180 --> 00:14:26,680
You should work.
Talk about the drama.

436
00:14:26,680 --> 00:14:28,180
You're lost in admiration.

437
00:14:28,180 --> 00:14:29,510
Gosh, no.

438
00:14:29,510 --> 00:14:30,980
Dong Jun, you should wait outside.

439
00:14:30,980 --> 00:14:32,370
- That's not true.
- Look at her.

440
00:14:32,920 --> 00:14:35,420
So we have Doyeon here.

441
00:14:35,420 --> 00:14:36,750
Please give a round of applause
to the six guests...

442
00:14:36,750 --> 00:14:38,190
who are joining us today.

443
00:14:40,460 --> 00:14:43,620
Today, we're going to have
Don't Worry Be Happy Partner Race.

444
00:14:43,620 --> 00:14:46,670
The eight members of Running Man
acquired the mission fund...

445
00:14:46,670 --> 00:14:49,230
according to the results
of last week's missions.

446
00:14:49,230 --> 00:14:51,230
- I feel bad for my partner.
- The guests will choose...

447
00:14:51,230 --> 00:14:54,170
their partners without knowing
the amount the members have.

448
00:14:54,170 --> 00:14:55,500
There's definitely a dud.

449
00:14:55,500 --> 00:14:57,770
So you'd better try to choose
a partner...

450
00:14:57,770 --> 00:14:59,710
who seems to have
a lot of money for the race.

451
00:14:59,710 --> 00:15:02,180
Since the guests don't
have the mission fund,

452
00:15:02,180 --> 00:15:04,220
- we will give them 10 dollars each.
- 10 dollars?

453
00:15:04,220 --> 00:15:05,870
(The guests get the mission fund
of 10 dollars each.)

454
00:15:06,110 --> 00:15:07,220
- 10 dollars?
- Are they getting 10 dollars?

455
00:15:07,220 --> 00:15:09,190
- It's no problem then.
- What?

456
00:15:09,190 --> 00:15:11,220
He seems pretty happy.

457
00:15:11,220 --> 00:15:13,650
- Now I don't feel pressure.
- I bet Jae Suk has no money.

458
00:15:14,120 --> 00:15:15,120
(He seems very happy.)

459
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:16,850
- He's happy.
- 10 dollars is big money.

460
00:15:17,250 --> 00:15:18,730
- Do you have no money?
- What?

461
00:15:18,730 --> 00:15:20,430
- Do you not have any money?
- That's not true.

462
00:15:20,430 --> 00:15:22,360
- He doesn't.
- I guess he has no money.

463
00:15:22,360 --> 00:15:24,890
- He's completely broke.
- He's totally penniless.

464
00:15:25,260 --> 00:15:27,840
You will play Dice Proposal
to decide partners.

465
00:15:28,440 --> 00:15:32,440
The seven men will
get a blank dice each.

466
00:15:32,440 --> 00:15:35,080
And they will take turns
to find a partner.

467
00:15:35,080 --> 00:15:38,740
Once a man comes out,
women will put a sticker...

468
00:15:38,740 --> 00:15:40,380
on his dice if they like him.

469
00:15:40,380 --> 00:15:42,240
(The women will put stickers
on the dice of a man they want.)

470
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:45,010
And you will pay a dollar
every time you put a sticker.

471
00:15:45,010 --> 00:15:47,060
If they want to be picked,
they will spend a lot of money.

472
00:15:47,060 --> 00:15:49,250
You can put stickers on six faces
if you want.

473
00:15:49,250 --> 00:15:51,490
- Gosh, So Min.
- Don't look at me.

474
00:15:51,490 --> 00:15:53,760
(So Min, Soyou, Mijoo,
Ji Hyo, Won Young, Doyeon, Yuqi)

475
00:15:53,890 --> 00:15:56,990
If you want to be
Ji Suk Jin's partner,

476
00:15:57,200 --> 00:16:00,070
please raise your hand and tell me
how many stickers you need.

477
00:16:00,070 --> 00:16:02,260
- This is cruel.
- Soyou is moving.

478
00:16:02,260 --> 00:16:03,310
The girls are busy.

479
00:16:03,310 --> 00:16:06,480
- Mijoo is going through her bag.
- They're going through their bags.

480
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:07,900
Everyone.

481
00:16:07,900 --> 00:16:12,780
Ji Hyo is opening her bag now.

482
00:16:12,780 --> 00:16:15,110
- She makes a lot of gestures now.
- She's opening it.

483
00:16:15,140 --> 00:16:16,590
- Look at him.
- I have some money.

484
00:16:16,590 --> 00:16:18,420
- He has a lot of money.
- Can he show his money like that?

485
00:16:18,820 --> 00:16:20,850
- I'll buy six stickers.
- All right.

486
00:16:21,020 --> 00:16:22,060
Six stickers?

487
00:16:22,060 --> 00:16:24,100
- You're buying all the stickers?
- Do you have to do that?

488
00:16:24,100 --> 00:16:25,560
She wants to make sure.

489
00:16:25,560 --> 00:16:27,700
- He's got a lot of money.
- Just stay still.

490
00:16:27,700 --> 00:16:29,890
- You have a lot of money.
- Just stay quiet!

491
00:16:29,890 --> 00:16:31,340
I'm doing this for money.

492
00:16:31,340 --> 00:16:32,730
- I told you to just stay still.
- Look at them.

493
00:16:32,730 --> 00:16:34,840
- I said I'm buying them all.
- Song Ji Hyo!

494
00:16:34,840 --> 00:16:37,710
- Song Ji Hyo!
- Song Ji Hyo!

495
00:16:37,710 --> 00:16:40,500
If there's anyone else who wants
to buy it, Suk Jin gets to choose.

496
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:41,580
But there's no one.

497
00:16:41,580 --> 00:16:43,820
Who knows? You should
give them some time.

498
00:16:43,820 --> 00:16:46,420
- He likes it.
- There's no one. Don't look back.

499
00:16:46,420 --> 00:16:47,550
- Hey.
- No one wants you.

500
00:16:47,610 --> 00:16:49,460
Mijoo, did you just shake your arm?

501
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:51,060
(She just expressed her feelings.)

502
00:16:51,060 --> 00:16:53,280
Ji Hyo is the big player here.

503
00:16:53,280 --> 00:16:55,330
- I think so.
- I know. She's so cool.

504
00:16:55,330 --> 00:16:56,520
(It's the meeting
of Big Nose and Big Player.)

505
00:16:56,520 --> 00:16:57,560
- One.
- Suk Jin.

506
00:16:57,560 --> 00:16:58,730
All right. It's settled.

507
00:16:59,060 --> 00:17:00,700
(As expected, Suk Jin
and Ji Hyo have become partners.)

508
00:17:00,700 --> 00:17:01,700
He did this.

509
00:17:02,990 --> 00:17:04,200
Yes!

510
00:17:04,470 --> 00:17:06,340
- Who's next?
- Dong Jun.

511
00:17:06,530 --> 00:17:09,730
If you want to be
Dong Jun's partner,

512
00:17:09,730 --> 00:17:10,830
(Laughing)

513
00:17:10,830 --> 00:17:13,240
- please tell me.
- She's about to sell her soul.

514
00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:15,000
Look at her face.

515
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,240
There's one woman
who's raising her hand bashfully.

516
00:17:17,450 --> 00:17:19,040
- She's willing to sell her soul.
- So Min.

517
00:17:19,040 --> 00:17:21,650
- She's acting cute.
- Why are you being so shy?

518
00:17:21,650 --> 00:17:23,510
- How many do you want?
- I'll buy one sticker.

519
00:17:23,550 --> 00:17:24,780
Just one?

520
00:17:24,780 --> 00:17:27,730
- One is enough.
- Then I'll buy the rest five.

521
00:17:27,980 --> 00:17:29,460
- What? So suddenly?
- Can I do that?

522
00:17:29,590 --> 00:17:31,630
No. I'll buy six.

523
00:17:31,630 --> 00:17:32,630
(Surprised)

524
00:17:32,630 --> 00:17:33,670
I'll buy six stickers.

525
00:17:33,670 --> 00:17:34,900
For whom are you
buying five stickers?

526
00:17:36,020 --> 00:17:37,090
For So Min.

527
00:17:37,090 --> 00:17:39,410
(It's all for So Min.)

528
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:40,560
What?

529
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:41,910
- Can I do that?
- I didn't know.

530
00:17:41,910 --> 00:17:43,330
- What was that?
- My gosh.

531
00:17:43,730 --> 00:17:44,800
For So Min?

532
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:46,480
- Why are you doing that?
- He's so nice.

533
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:48,300
- Hang on.
- What is going on?

534
00:17:48,300 --> 00:17:50,040
- He's sweet.
- We're just...

535
00:17:50,040 --> 00:17:52,310
playing games with partners.

536
00:17:52,310 --> 00:17:54,040
This is just a game.

537
00:17:54,040 --> 00:17:56,310
This isn't about dating someone.

538
00:17:56,310 --> 00:17:58,810
- Isn't this "X-Man"?
- This isn't "X-Man".

539
00:17:58,810 --> 00:18:00,980
You might not see her ever again
after this show.

540
00:18:00,980 --> 00:18:02,250
Exactly.

541
00:18:02,360 --> 00:18:04,820
I'll just buy six stickers.

542
00:18:05,050 --> 00:18:07,760
Is there anyone else
who wants to join?

543
00:18:08,090 --> 00:18:09,290
That's not possible.

544
00:18:10,470 --> 00:18:12,400
- You two are partners now.
- Okay. I bought six stickers.

545
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:13,940
So Min and Dong Jun are partners.

546
00:18:13,940 --> 00:18:16,830
How can I play games spontaneously
when he's being like this?

547
00:18:16,830 --> 00:18:18,110
Come here.

548
00:18:18,110 --> 00:18:19,270
Hello.

549
00:18:19,270 --> 00:18:20,910
Hello. Let's do this.

550
00:18:20,910 --> 00:18:21,980
(And the rest of them
chose partners as well.)

551
00:18:22,070 --> 00:18:23,180
(Se Chan and Doyeon,
Kwang Soo and Won Young)

552
00:18:23,180 --> 00:18:24,340
(Jong Kook and Soyou,
Haha and Mijoo)

553
00:18:24,340 --> 00:18:25,450
(So Min and Dong Jun,
Jae Suk and Yuqi)

554
00:18:25,450 --> 00:18:26,450
(Suk Jin and Ji Hyo)

555
00:18:26,450 --> 00:18:28,390
So your partners are decided now.

556
00:18:28,390 --> 00:18:31,250
I'll give you prize money according
to the results after each round.

557
00:18:31,250 --> 00:18:33,630
The top two partners
with the most money...

558
00:18:33,630 --> 00:18:35,750
can buy any items we prepared...

559
00:18:35,750 --> 00:18:38,430
with your prize money.

560
00:18:38,430 --> 00:18:40,090
- Really?
- Yuqi, this is the day.

561
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:41,700
- It's the day.
- This is the day.

562
00:18:41,700 --> 00:18:43,900
And the partners
with the least money...

563
00:18:43,900 --> 00:18:45,900
- will get a penalty.
- There's a penalty as well.

564
00:18:45,900 --> 00:18:47,730
- Oh, the team that comes in last...
- Once you put on your team uniform,

565
00:18:47,730 --> 00:18:49,830
- we will start the mission.
- Let's go!

566
00:18:50,070 --> 00:18:51,180
Let's bring it on!

567
00:18:52,710 --> 00:18:54,540
(They've changed
into the team uniform.)

568
00:18:56,040 --> 00:18:57,980
(So Min is the first one
to show up.)

569
00:18:57,980 --> 00:18:59,070
She came early again.

570
00:18:59,070 --> 00:19:00,390
- What?
- You're early again.

571
00:19:00,390 --> 00:19:01,540
Why?

572
00:19:01,920 --> 00:19:03,920
(She fixes her makeup
since she's here early.)

573
00:19:05,550 --> 00:19:07,750
(She rubs her hands.)

574
00:19:07,750 --> 00:19:09,050
It's cool in here.

575
00:19:09,050 --> 00:19:10,090
(This is what she always does,
but she seems somewhat nervous.)

576
00:19:10,090 --> 00:19:11,230
I guess we're doing something.

577
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:12,820
(It's a mission where you dance.)

578
00:19:13,130 --> 00:19:15,730
Are we dancing? Dance?

579
00:19:16,970 --> 00:19:19,440
(As soon as she hears
about dancing,)

580
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:22,560
(she starts to stretch,
feeling shy.)

581
00:19:23,830 --> 00:19:25,570
I can't dance.

582
00:19:25,570 --> 00:19:27,380
I have a bad back.

583
00:19:27,380 --> 00:19:28,500
(She says she can't dance.)

584
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:31,040
I have no money. I'm broke.

585
00:19:31,040 --> 00:19:32,890
But I don't want my partner
to get a penalty.

586
00:19:33,810 --> 00:19:36,040
I'd feel bad
if he got a penalty here.

587
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:38,620
Please gather around.

588
00:19:38,620 --> 00:19:39,860
- Okay.
- Yes.

589
00:19:39,860 --> 00:19:41,230
Here's the first mission.

590
00:19:41,230 --> 00:19:43,520
It's an extreme battle between
a defender and an attacker.

591
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:45,520
Freeze Tag Dancing King.

592
00:19:45,900 --> 00:19:47,630
I bet Jong Kook will be good at it.

593
00:19:47,630 --> 00:19:51,290
- It's done. We're ready.
- You'll be divided into two groups.

594
00:19:51,290 --> 00:19:53,670
And each team will dance
in the red zone in turn.

595
00:19:53,670 --> 00:19:57,000
Once I point out the best dancers,
the music will stop.

596
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,480
Then they can push out
the opponents for 10 seconds.

597
00:19:59,480 --> 00:20:01,410
And we will give them money for
the number of members pushed out.

598
00:20:02,300 --> 00:20:04,450
- We have to be strong.
- Jong Kook must be good at this.

599
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:06,620
- Soyou is just as strong.
- And we should dance well.

600
00:20:06,620 --> 00:20:07,840
That's right.

601
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:09,690
The important thing
is the list of matches.

602
00:20:09,690 --> 00:20:11,960
We have seven spoons
divided into two groups.

603
00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:14,480
You will pick one. Those with
the same color will dance together.

604
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:16,820
- Yuqi, you must pick a good group.
- Really?

605
00:20:16,820 --> 00:20:18,860
We can't be in the same group
with Jong Kook and Soyou.

606
00:20:18,860 --> 00:20:21,370
You have only 30 cents anyway.

607
00:20:21,370 --> 00:20:23,790
You will see who smiles at the end.

608
00:20:23,900 --> 00:20:25,200
But you have only 30 cents.

609
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:26,200
(They all picked a spoon.)

610
00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:28,560
- My gosh.
- They all are really strong.

611
00:20:28,610 --> 00:20:30,210
Let's begin then.

612
00:20:30,210 --> 00:20:32,770
If you're pushed out,
you're not eliminated.

613
00:20:32,770 --> 00:20:34,950
You will just lose your money
every time you're pushed out.

614
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,880
How far can we go
when we push out the opponents?

615
00:20:37,880 --> 00:20:39,420
Why would you ask a question
like that, Soyou?

616
00:20:39,420 --> 00:20:40,690
Soyou, just don't kill them.

617
00:20:40,690 --> 00:20:42,720
- It can be as hard as you can.
- What is she doing with her hand?

618
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:44,960
You can also tickle them.

619
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:46,080
I don't feel ticklish.

620
00:20:46,430 --> 00:20:48,050
- He's not tickled either.
- I'm not ticklish.

621
00:20:48,050 --> 00:20:49,460
- Really?
- I feel nothing.

622
00:20:49,460 --> 00:20:52,400
- How can I play games with them?
- I'm not ticklish at all.

623
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:54,290
Jong Kook and Soyou...

624
00:20:54,520 --> 00:20:56,440
look like trainers at a gym.

625
00:20:56,640 --> 00:20:58,590
- That's true.
- We should open a gym.

626
00:20:58,590 --> 00:21:00,530
- It's so funny.
- We should open a gym.

627
00:21:00,610 --> 00:21:04,880
I think we should hug
each other to win.

628
00:21:05,570 --> 00:21:06,570
(Scoffing)

629
00:21:06,570 --> 00:21:08,180
No, that's not what I meant.

630
00:21:08,180 --> 00:21:09,950
- Hang on.
- I'm sorry.

631
00:21:09,950 --> 00:21:11,540
- Wait.
- Don't say that.

632
00:21:11,540 --> 00:21:13,240
- I made a slip of the tongue.
- Se Chan...

633
00:21:13,240 --> 00:21:14,540
- told Doyeon,
- Stop it.

634
00:21:14,540 --> 00:21:17,620
"I think we should hug
each other to win."

635
00:21:17,620 --> 00:21:18,860
(Se Chan says they should
hug each other to win.)

636
00:21:19,220 --> 00:21:20,960
No, it was a slip of the tongue.

637
00:21:21,020 --> 00:21:22,990
- I didn't mean it.
- Hey.

638
00:21:22,990 --> 00:21:24,050
- What was that?
- I mean we should stick together.

639
00:21:24,050 --> 00:21:25,820
What are you trying to pull off?

640
00:21:25,820 --> 00:21:26,870
What are you doing?

641
00:21:26,870 --> 00:21:28,470
I just meant
we should stick together.

642
00:21:28,470 --> 00:21:29,640
Don't be ridiculous.

643
00:21:29,640 --> 00:21:30,670
It's not like that.

644
00:21:30,670 --> 00:21:31,790
It's a mistake. I meant to say
we should stick together.

645
00:21:31,790 --> 00:21:33,300
- Look at him.
- Let's hold together, okay?

646
00:21:33,530 --> 00:21:35,640
- Gosh, I was surprised.
- I tried to ignore it.

647
00:21:35,640 --> 00:21:38,330
He's painting a big picture.

648
00:21:38,330 --> 00:21:40,540
- We should stand together.
- You know what?

649
00:21:40,710 --> 00:21:43,340
We've never seen Se Chan so happy
for the past year.

650
00:21:43,340 --> 00:21:44,450
He's so energetic.

651
00:21:44,450 --> 00:21:45,880
- He's smiling broadly.
- He's smiling a lot.

652
00:21:45,880 --> 00:21:47,190
You look bright today.

653
00:21:47,190 --> 00:21:48,190
I'm happy today.

654
00:21:48,950 --> 00:21:50,810
I'll play the music then.

655
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:52,460
Music, please.

656
00:21:52,460 --> 00:21:53,820
Dong Jun is a good dancer.

657
00:21:53,820 --> 00:21:55,190
I bet Dong Jun is good.

658
00:21:56,020 --> 00:21:58,160
(No one is excited
about Kwang Soo's dance.)

659
00:21:59,460 --> 00:22:01,060
(Warming up)

660
00:22:01,060 --> 00:22:02,200
Mijoo is on fire.

661
00:22:02,200 --> 00:22:04,470
(The audience is excited too.)

662
00:22:05,060 --> 00:22:06,090
- Show us what you've got.
- Hey, Jong Kook.

663
00:22:06,090 --> 00:22:07,140
- There they are.
- Show us your dance.

664
00:22:07,140 --> 00:22:09,000
The music is too slow.

665
00:22:09,210 --> 00:22:11,230
Show us the workout dance.

666
00:22:11,710 --> 00:22:13,070
Go ahead and do bench presses.

667
00:22:13,070 --> 00:22:16,180
They are lifting dumbbells.
It's a dumbbell dance.

668
00:22:16,650 --> 00:22:18,810
- Go ahead and do bench presses.
- Okay.

669
00:22:18,810 --> 00:22:21,220
- List it up.
- Okay.

670
00:22:22,010 --> 00:22:23,580
Let's do some bench presses.

671
00:22:23,580 --> 00:22:25,160
Okay.

672
00:22:25,160 --> 00:22:26,890
- Okay.
- It suits you.

673
00:22:26,890 --> 00:22:28,550
- I know.
- Okay.

674
00:22:29,430 --> 00:22:31,200
(Kwang Soo and Won Young step up.)

675
00:22:31,960 --> 00:22:32,990
There they go.

676
00:22:32,990 --> 00:22:34,290
What are they doing?

677
00:22:37,830 --> 00:22:38,830
What are they doing?

678
00:22:40,910 --> 00:22:43,210
(The dance that Kwang Soo and
Won Young will do is...)

679
00:22:43,910 --> 00:22:45,640
(The 1st step is a fatal gaze.)

680
00:22:46,270 --> 00:22:49,840
(The 2nd step is various model poses
using their long arms and legs.)

681
00:22:50,570 --> 00:22:52,120
What are they doing
instead of dancing?

682
00:22:52,120 --> 00:22:53,390
Stop doing model poses.

683
00:22:53,390 --> 00:22:55,280
What are they doing
instead of dancing?

684
00:22:55,280 --> 00:22:56,580
(He's not bothered
and continues being annoying.)

685
00:22:57,480 --> 00:22:58,860
(Jae Suk comes up to him...)

686
00:22:58,860 --> 00:23:00,020
What is he doing?

687
00:23:01,390 --> 00:23:02,480
(and punishes him with a headlock.)

688
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:04,250
Why is he doing this?

689
00:23:04,750 --> 00:23:05,860
Why?

690
00:23:05,860 --> 00:23:07,200
(This is the cost of acting cool
instead of dancing.)

691
00:23:08,200 --> 00:23:09,760
(Just you wait.)

692
00:23:10,260 --> 00:23:11,760
Gosh, that was so annoying.

693
00:23:12,030 --> 00:23:14,370
It was really annoying.

694
00:23:14,670 --> 00:23:16,830
(The next song is...)

695
00:23:18,440 --> 00:23:20,410
("Shake It" by SISTAR)

696
00:23:21,540 --> 00:23:23,380
(As soon as she hears the song,)

697
00:23:23,380 --> 00:23:25,420
(Se Chan and Doyeon step up.)

698
00:23:27,540 --> 00:23:29,540
- SISTAR!
- Is it SISTAR's song?

699
00:23:29,540 --> 00:23:30,750
(She dances to SISTAR's
choreography perfectly.)

700
00:23:30,750 --> 00:23:31,750
Wait.

701
00:23:32,360 --> 00:23:33,980
She's really good at dancing.

702
00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:36,190
She only came up to show off.

703
00:23:36,790 --> 00:23:38,050
Nice.

704
00:23:38,050 --> 00:23:39,290
(Shake it, shake it.)

705
00:23:39,290 --> 00:23:41,430
(They do a couple wave dance.)

706
00:23:41,590 --> 00:23:43,440
(Doing his best)

707
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:44,900
I think Se Chan...

708
00:23:44,900 --> 00:23:46,440
- is so funny.
- Hey, Se Chan...

709
00:23:46,560 --> 00:23:48,060
Se Chan looks like her helper.

710
00:23:48,060 --> 00:23:49,530
He's serious.

711
00:23:49,880 --> 00:23:51,880
(Yang Helper does his best.)

712
00:23:52,800 --> 00:23:56,070
(Even if she doesn't look at him,
he does his best behind her.)

713
00:23:56,450 --> 00:23:58,070
(The music changes.)

714
00:23:58,070 --> 00:23:59,570
(The look in his eyes changes.)

715
00:24:00,390 --> 00:24:01,740
(So Min and Dong Jun
step up carefully.)

716
00:24:01,740 --> 00:24:03,980
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

717
00:24:04,220 --> 00:24:06,010
- Let's go!
- Goodness.

718
00:24:08,730 --> 00:24:10,790
(He begins breakdancing.)

719
00:24:12,230 --> 00:24:13,230
(His coolness explodes.)

720
00:24:13,230 --> 00:24:14,790
- Did you see that?
- All of a sudden.

721
00:24:15,990 --> 00:24:19,200
(The idol singer
of 11 years rips apart the stage.)

722
00:24:20,230 --> 00:24:21,410
Did you see that?

723
00:24:22,560 --> 00:24:24,570
(There's no break to her heart
as she watches him breakdancing.)

724
00:24:24,570 --> 00:24:25,570
So Min!

725
00:24:26,110 --> 00:24:28,680
- So Min, pull yourself together!
- So Min!

726
00:24:28,680 --> 00:24:30,920
(She loses her mind
and lets go of herself.)

727
00:24:30,920 --> 00:24:32,450
(The frog lets go of herself
without any breaks.)

728
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:33,780
She's break dancing too.

729
00:24:33,780 --> 00:24:36,120
So Min, pull yourself together!

730
00:24:36,860 --> 00:24:37,980
Pull yourself together!

731
00:24:38,120 --> 00:24:40,320
3, 2,

732
00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:41,960
One. Dong Jun and So Min.

733
00:24:41,960 --> 00:24:43,130
- Dong Jun.
- Hold on.

734
00:24:43,130 --> 00:24:44,790
(The couple that is called on
will get prize money...)

735
00:24:44,790 --> 00:24:46,430
(according to how many people
they push out in 10 seconds.)

736
00:24:46,430 --> 00:24:47,520
(So Min and Dong Jun
were called on.)

737
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:48,520
Dong Jun.

738
00:24:48,520 --> 00:24:50,230
- Hold onto me.
- Pull them out. Okay!

739
00:24:50,700 --> 00:24:52,400
- I'm frozen.
- He's frozen.

740
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:55,060
I'm frozen. I'm frozen!

741
00:24:55,060 --> 00:24:56,910
(Is he getting dismembered?)

742
00:24:56,910 --> 00:25:00,480
- He's almost out.
- I'm sorry, Se Chan.

743
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:02,880
(He grabbed his belt
and pulled him out.)

744
00:25:03,810 --> 00:25:04,840
He's out.

745
00:25:04,840 --> 00:25:06,310
(Dong Jun is incredible.)

746
00:25:07,120 --> 00:25:09,390
- I'm sorry, Se Chan.
- Sit down.

747
00:25:09,690 --> 00:25:11,420
(Dong Jun's next target is...)

748
00:25:11,420 --> 00:25:12,580
- No.
- I'm sorry, Kwang Soo.

749
00:25:12,580 --> 00:25:14,280
- No.
- Wait. This is... Hey!

750
00:25:14,280 --> 00:25:15,960
- No!
- Hey!

751
00:25:15,960 --> 00:25:17,790
(This time, he goes for
Kwang Soo's belt.)

752
00:25:18,700 --> 00:25:19,700
Gosh, this is...

753
00:25:19,700 --> 00:25:21,430
(Kwang Soo endures it,
and the time ends.)

754
00:25:21,430 --> 00:25:23,830
Se Chan...

755
00:25:23,970 --> 00:25:26,830
- Se Chan...
- You almost hung him.

756
00:25:27,140 --> 00:25:30,000
- Se Chan almost got hung.
- Where did he grab?

757
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:31,530
He grabbed me at a weird place.

758
00:25:31,530 --> 00:25:33,210
- Get up.
- So...

759
00:25:33,210 --> 00:25:35,000
- There's no place to grab, so...
- It's okay...

760
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:36,740
- to grab us by our pants,
- It was too...

761
00:25:36,740 --> 00:25:38,310
but why would you put your fingers
in between my cheeks?

762
00:25:38,770 --> 00:25:40,780
He tried to rip them off.

763
00:25:40,780 --> 00:25:44,480
When Se Chan and Doyeon
were dancing,

764
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:46,860
it looked like a guy who was dating
a girl that's out of his league.

765
00:25:47,860 --> 00:25:48,960
(I'm undeserving
of such a girlfriend.)

766
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:50,700
- It's hard for him to handle her.
- Right.

767
00:25:50,700 --> 00:25:52,400
She's a girl that's out of
his league.

768
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:55,320
This is the second round of
the mission. Cue the music.

769
00:25:55,320 --> 00:25:56,400
(The music starts.)

770
00:25:57,140 --> 00:25:58,140
("After Effect" by ZE:A)

771
00:25:58,140 --> 00:25:59,140
You should go up.

772
00:26:00,210 --> 00:26:01,210
I don't know your dance.

773
00:26:01,670 --> 00:26:02,730
Just do this.

774
00:26:02,730 --> 00:26:04,380
(All Dong Jun did was dance.)

775
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:06,180
I can't do it.

776
00:26:07,270 --> 00:26:08,980
Look at So Min.

777
00:26:10,740 --> 00:26:12,270
- What are they doing?
- Come over here.

778
00:26:12,270 --> 00:26:13,740
- Why are they dating here?
- Seriously.

779
00:26:13,740 --> 00:26:15,420
Hold on. Wait.

780
00:26:15,420 --> 00:26:17,250
Hold on. So Min is really...

781
00:26:17,750 --> 00:26:20,860
in the middle of date right now.
I'm serious.

782
00:26:21,160 --> 00:26:22,890
- My goodness.
- So Min. Enough already.

783
00:26:22,890 --> 00:26:24,430
- So Min is...
- Don't date here.

784
00:26:24,430 --> 00:26:28,760
It's not that. Dong Jun
looks at people with warm eyes.

785
00:26:28,760 --> 00:26:30,560
Do we look at you with cold eyes?

786
00:26:30,590 --> 00:26:31,670
Yes.

787
00:26:31,670 --> 00:26:34,470
Look at his eyes. They're so warm.

788
00:26:34,470 --> 00:26:36,610
- You're too much.
- No.

789
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:38,730
Gosh, it's so hot.

790
00:26:38,730 --> 00:26:40,040
(They put their date on hold
and get back to work.)

791
00:26:41,180 --> 00:26:42,180
Whose song is this?

792
00:26:43,110 --> 00:26:45,040
(Kwang Soo and Won Young
step up immediately.)

793
00:26:46,420 --> 00:26:47,480
(Flapping around)

794
00:26:47,480 --> 00:26:49,840
Gosh. Doesn't he look like a bug?

795
00:26:51,160 --> 00:26:52,660
He really does.

796
00:26:52,660 --> 00:26:55,130
(A new kind of bug dance)

797
00:26:56,020 --> 00:26:57,090
He looks like a bug.

798
00:26:57,090 --> 00:26:58,490
(He gets rid of the bug.)

799
00:26:58,490 --> 00:27:00,700
- What now?
- You're so annoying!

800
00:27:00,700 --> 00:27:02,370
- Why?
- Goodness.

801
00:27:03,370 --> 00:27:05,200
- What song is this?
- We should go up.

802
00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:07,470
(Back to the millennium.)

803
00:27:07,470 --> 00:27:08,640
Is this it?

804
00:27:09,260 --> 00:27:11,480
- How do you do this?
- Soyou is really good.

805
00:27:11,480 --> 00:27:12,940
Oh, my.

806
00:27:12,940 --> 00:27:14,070
(Soyou is really good.)

807
00:27:15,570 --> 00:27:16,920
How do you do that?

808
00:27:18,120 --> 00:27:20,480
(It's a retro dance that minimizes
muscle loss.)

809
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:22,010
- It's over.
- They're good.

810
00:27:22,010 --> 00:27:23,040
- It's over.
- Do it harder.

811
00:27:23,040 --> 00:27:24,420
It's over.

812
00:27:24,780 --> 00:27:27,280
(An event balloon intrudes.)

813
00:27:28,660 --> 00:27:31,090
(Jang Won Young the balloon
begins spinning her sangmo.)

814
00:27:31,550 --> 00:27:33,230
(Won Young is so cute.)

815
00:27:33,560 --> 00:27:35,970
Jeon So Min. Why is she going up?

816
00:27:36,170 --> 00:27:37,230
(I shouldn't sit out
during a retro dance.)

817
00:27:37,230 --> 00:27:38,260
Look at So Min.

818
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:41,640
(A retro dance party featuring
event balloons)

819
00:27:42,060 --> 00:27:44,440
Okay. 3, 2,

820
00:27:44,570 --> 00:27:46,530
One. Kim Jong Kook and Soyou.

821
00:27:46,530 --> 00:27:47,950
Oh, my gosh.

822
00:27:48,340 --> 00:27:49,570
Kim Jong Kook and Soyou.

823
00:27:49,570 --> 00:27:51,680
(As soon as they are called on,
Won Young goes flying.)

824
00:27:53,150 --> 00:27:55,010
Oh, my.

825
00:27:55,510 --> 00:27:56,890
Gosh, that surprised me.

826
00:27:58,010 --> 00:27:59,860
(Soyou is incredibly strong.)

827
00:27:59,860 --> 00:28:01,020
You shouldn't do this.

828
00:28:01,020 --> 00:28:02,230
- I'm sorry.
- I'm sorry.

829
00:28:02,230 --> 00:28:03,430
I'm sorry, guys.

830
00:28:04,550 --> 00:28:06,400
He keeps grabbing me
in a weird place.

831
00:28:07,670 --> 00:28:09,670
- Oh, my.
- Gosh, this is incredible.

832
00:28:09,760 --> 00:28:10,970
Gosh, this is incredible.

833
00:28:10,970 --> 00:28:12,490
(Trainer Kook can pull two people
at once with his strength.)

834
00:28:13,670 --> 00:28:15,170
He's so cool.

835
00:28:16,110 --> 00:28:17,110
- Amazing.
- There you go.

836
00:28:17,110 --> 00:28:18,530
- Jong Kook!
- We did it.

837
00:28:18,530 --> 00:28:20,240
It's clean.

838
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:22,300
How can we beat them?

839
00:28:22,300 --> 00:28:23,540
They're too strong.

840
00:28:23,540 --> 00:28:24,680
That was nice and neat.

841
00:28:24,680 --> 00:28:27,390
- They got six dollars.
- That was nice.

842
00:28:27,980 --> 00:28:30,510
I thought he was a bulldozer.

843
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:33,010
An adult joined a game with kids.

844
00:28:33,190 --> 00:28:36,320
So Min and Dong Jun got 1 dollar.
Jong Kook and Soyou got 6 dollars.

845
00:28:36,320 --> 00:28:37,320
Okay.

846
00:28:37,320 --> 00:28:38,430
(The second group will go next.)

847
00:28:38,430 --> 00:28:39,900
She's warming up.

848
00:28:40,790 --> 00:28:43,090
This is going to be interesting
because of Mijoo.

849
00:28:44,330 --> 00:28:46,200
- Nice.
- Hey.

850
00:28:46,560 --> 00:28:48,830
Why didn't we get songs like this?

851
00:28:48,830 --> 00:28:50,110
They came up.

852
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:52,210
They played this song a lot
on "X-Man".

853
00:28:53,480 --> 00:28:55,300
- This song is hard to dance to.
- It is.

854
00:28:56,300 --> 00:28:58,310
(She warms up a little...)

855
00:28:58,310 --> 00:29:00,310
That's right.

856
00:29:00,310 --> 00:29:01,580
(and releases
her dancing instincts.)

857
00:29:01,580 --> 00:29:03,220
That's right.

858
00:29:03,280 --> 00:29:04,660
That's it.

859
00:29:04,660 --> 00:29:06,980
(Behind her cute appearance, her
powerful dance skills were hidden.)

860
00:29:07,690 --> 00:29:09,190
(Making a fuss)

861
00:29:09,190 --> 00:29:10,490
What is this?

862
00:29:10,490 --> 00:29:12,490
Why are you dancing for so long?
Go back in.

863
00:29:12,900 --> 00:29:14,200
(Acting frivolous)

864
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:16,400
(Stopping)

865
00:29:16,400 --> 00:29:17,760
You wanted to do something,
but you couldn't, right?

866
00:29:17,760 --> 00:29:18,790
(Nodding)

867
00:29:19,590 --> 00:29:20,940
(The next song is...)

868
00:29:20,940 --> 00:29:21,970
("Gang".)

869
00:29:21,970 --> 00:29:23,140
It's "Gang".

870
00:29:23,140 --> 00:29:24,830
(The look in her eyes changes
as soon as she hears the song.)

871
00:29:24,830 --> 00:29:25,980
It's "Gang".

872
00:29:25,980 --> 00:29:27,770
- "Gang".
- Hey.

873
00:29:28,150 --> 00:29:30,510
Mijoo, you look so cool.

874
00:29:30,510 --> 00:29:31,510
She's good.

875
00:29:33,180 --> 00:29:34,480
She's good at it.

876
00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:35,620
What was that?

877
00:29:35,650 --> 00:29:36,890
(Haha is crawling on the floor.)

878
00:29:36,890 --> 00:29:38,420
Do you know what that is?

879
00:29:38,420 --> 00:29:40,280
- What is that?
- That's not how you do it.

880
00:29:40,280 --> 00:29:41,660
That's not how you do it.

881
00:29:41,690 --> 00:29:43,930
(She does it perfectly.
She must watch it 3 times a day.)

882
00:29:44,930 --> 00:29:46,660
(The Rain Effect is when you
entrust your body...)

883
00:29:46,660 --> 00:29:48,400
(to the "Gang" rhythm.)

884
00:29:48,400 --> 00:29:50,230
(At that moment)

885
00:29:50,230 --> 00:29:52,170
(The reason why everyone
is cracking up)

886
00:29:53,560 --> 00:29:56,170
(She suddenly transforms into
a gorilla.)

887
00:29:56,170 --> 00:29:58,270
("Gang" has reached its limit.)

888
00:29:58,570 --> 00:30:00,770
We should've done it.

889
00:30:00,770 --> 00:30:02,710
Why are you going that far?

890
00:30:03,620 --> 00:30:06,570
(Her tenacious DNA
goes beyond "Gang".)

891
00:30:06,890 --> 00:30:09,510
She's incredible.
Just as I expected her to be.

892
00:30:10,250 --> 00:30:12,080
- You guys should go.
- Ji Hyo, let's go.

893
00:30:13,580 --> 00:30:16,430
Suk Jin looks so cheesy.

894
00:30:16,630 --> 00:30:17,750
(Slow dancing)

895
00:30:17,750 --> 00:30:18,930
What are they doing?

896
00:30:19,860 --> 00:30:21,400
(What are they doing?)

897
00:30:21,400 --> 00:30:22,400
What is this?

898
00:30:22,400 --> 00:30:24,870
- Suk Jin, what is this?
- What is this?

899
00:30:25,970 --> 00:30:27,470
What is this?

900
00:30:27,970 --> 00:30:29,830
(The music changes.)

901
00:30:30,270 --> 00:30:31,530
- They know how to have fun.
- You should go.

902
00:30:31,530 --> 00:30:32,640
It's KOYOTE's song.

903
00:30:33,330 --> 00:30:35,680
(They reject the normal.)

904
00:30:37,880 --> 00:30:39,220
Gosh, Mijoo.

905
00:30:39,220 --> 00:30:40,420
(It's a surprising dance
that goes beyond our expectations.)

906
00:30:40,420 --> 00:30:42,690
She's unbelievable. Seriously.

907
00:30:42,690 --> 00:30:45,660
Her energy is unbelievable. Oh, my.
She's unbelievable.

908
00:30:45,660 --> 00:30:47,660
(Her hair came out?)

909
00:30:47,660 --> 00:30:49,580
She's unbelievable. Seriously.

910
00:30:49,580 --> 00:30:52,230
(The fantastic outing
of her hair extensions)

911
00:30:52,400 --> 00:30:53,930
- What is this?
- What is this?

912
00:30:53,930 --> 00:30:54,970
What is this?

913
00:30:54,970 --> 00:30:55,990
(She's doing her best.)

914
00:30:55,990 --> 00:30:58,200
- Mijoo.
- She ripped out her hair.

915
00:30:58,200 --> 00:30:59,760
Who's going to beat her?

916
00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:01,470
Nobody can beat her.

917
00:31:01,470 --> 00:31:02,940
- Who's going to beat her?
- Who's going to beat her?

918
00:31:02,940 --> 00:31:04,730
- What's with her prop?
- Who's going to beat her?

919
00:31:04,730 --> 00:31:06,180
- Is that necessary?
- What is going on?

920
00:31:06,180 --> 00:31:08,040
- She's doing her best to win.
- How can anyone beat her?

921
00:31:08,040 --> 00:31:09,950
Just give her the win.

922
00:31:09,950 --> 00:31:11,480
Mijoo, stop!

923
00:31:12,070 --> 00:31:13,120
She's the best.

924
00:31:13,120 --> 00:31:14,150
(She can't stop herself.)

925
00:31:14,150 --> 00:31:15,890
What did she pull out of her hair?

926
00:31:15,890 --> 00:31:17,890
- Why did she rip out her hair?
- She's the best.

927
00:31:18,890 --> 00:31:21,160
Are you okay? Hey.

928
00:31:21,160 --> 00:31:22,550
(Yuqi also takes out
her extensions.)

929
00:31:22,660 --> 00:31:24,430
This isn't a game where you
rip out your hair!

930
00:31:26,490 --> 00:31:28,790
Do you have any? Do you?

931
00:31:29,020 --> 00:31:31,330
(She joins the line
with disheveled hair.)

932
00:31:32,370 --> 00:31:36,000
(You can't escape
the insane hair party.)

933
00:31:36,800 --> 00:31:39,480
(What on earth is this?)

934
00:31:40,480 --> 00:31:42,300
(We didn't come up with this game
to see this.)

935
00:31:42,300 --> 00:31:43,740
Mijoo is incredible.

936
00:31:43,740 --> 00:31:45,980
(It was a feast
of unexpected dances.)

937
00:31:45,980 --> 00:31:47,390
- That's enough.
- Three,

938
00:31:47,390 --> 00:31:49,780
2, 1. Haha and Mijoo.

939
00:31:49,780 --> 00:31:51,220
- Are they coming again?
- Yes.

940
00:31:52,690 --> 00:31:54,250
Why are you so strong?

941
00:31:54,890 --> 00:31:57,700
He got him. He's dragging him out,
but he's not coming along.

942
00:31:57,700 --> 00:31:59,360
They're strong.

943
00:32:00,320 --> 00:32:01,700
The other side. Goodness.

944
00:32:03,640 --> 00:32:04,830
What is this?

945
00:32:05,990 --> 00:32:08,030
(Song Ji Hyo is out.)

946
00:32:08,610 --> 00:32:10,000
Song Ji Hyo is out.

947
00:32:10,730 --> 00:32:12,500
It was a close call,
but we came to that decision.

948
00:32:12,500 --> 00:32:13,980
It's impossible to beat Mijoo.

949
00:32:13,980 --> 00:32:16,110
- We can't beat her.
- She's unrivaled.

950
00:32:16,110 --> 00:32:17,380
How can they beat her?

951
00:32:17,380 --> 00:32:20,980
I don't think you can meet with
your mom for a while again.

952
00:32:21,190 --> 00:32:23,040
Will your mother be okay with this?

953
00:32:23,280 --> 00:32:24,620
She'll call me crazy again.

954
00:32:24,620 --> 00:32:26,010
- What?
- That's what she'd say.

955
00:32:26,010 --> 00:32:28,160
Why do K-pop idols
always have additional hair?

956
00:32:28,550 --> 00:32:29,550
- Right.
- I'm fascinated...

957
00:32:29,550 --> 00:32:30,550
by her reattaching it.

958
00:32:30,790 --> 00:32:33,230
- Is she reattaching it?
- I didn't know it was possible.

959
00:32:33,360 --> 00:32:34,930
Here are the results
for the second group.

960
00:32:34,930 --> 00:32:37,370
Jae Suk and Yuqi got 4 dollars.
Haha and Mijoo got 3 dollars.

961
00:32:37,370 --> 00:32:38,870
- Suk Jin and Ji Hyo got none.
- Three dollars?

962
00:32:38,870 --> 00:32:39,900
I bet you're hungry now.

963
00:32:39,900 --> 00:32:41,060
- Right.
- We are.

964
00:32:41,060 --> 00:32:42,730
You'll play...

965
00:32:42,730 --> 00:32:44,880
for the dish you want
with the money you earned.

966
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:46,940
This is Random Delivery.

967
00:32:46,940 --> 00:32:48,210
- Goodness.
- What now?

968
00:32:48,680 --> 00:32:52,040
Inside the 10 delivery cases
are 10 different dishes.

969
00:32:52,040 --> 00:32:53,780
Each team will come forward...

970
00:32:53,780 --> 00:32:55,420
and choose a delivery case.

971
00:32:55,420 --> 00:32:58,310
In secret,
the team will check what's inside.

972
00:32:58,310 --> 00:33:00,460
The other teams,
while not knowing what's inside,

973
00:33:00,460 --> 00:33:02,160
will ask questions about the dish...

974
00:33:02,160 --> 00:33:03,550
to decide how much they'll bid.

975
00:33:03,550 --> 00:33:05,960
The team with the highest bid
will win the dish.

976
00:33:05,960 --> 00:33:07,670
- My gosh.
- We have to bid on the dishes.

977
00:33:07,670 --> 00:33:10,440
Some dishes are enough
for the both of you,

978
00:33:10,440 --> 00:33:11,970
but some will leave you hungry.

979
00:33:12,470 --> 00:33:14,940
We need to fool them so that
they'd bid on a small portion.

980
00:33:14,940 --> 00:33:16,300
- Right.
- We need to fool them.

981
00:33:16,300 --> 00:33:18,110
Let's set up the cases first.

982
00:33:18,110 --> 00:33:19,440
(What kind of food
are in the cases?)

983
00:33:19,440 --> 00:33:21,770
- We'll now begin the auction.
- Sure.

984
00:33:21,770 --> 00:33:24,010
Please come forward, choose a case,

985
00:33:24,010 --> 00:33:25,650
and check what's inside.

986
00:33:25,650 --> 00:33:27,040
Watch carefully
when they pick it up.

987
00:33:27,040 --> 00:33:29,150
Which one? Take your pick.

988
00:33:29,150 --> 00:33:31,660
(After pondering,
he chooses case number nine.)

989
00:33:31,660 --> 00:33:33,820
- Case number nine.
- It must be light.

990
00:33:34,580 --> 00:33:36,660
- Dong Jun, it seems light.
- It's not.

991
00:33:37,250 --> 00:33:38,590
Your shoulder is still relaxed.

992
00:33:38,590 --> 00:33:39,960
It must be light.

993
00:33:39,960 --> 00:33:41,520
Please check what's inside.

994
00:33:42,320 --> 00:33:44,230
Look at them stalling.

995
00:33:44,230 --> 00:33:45,530
- So Min...
- Check So Min out.

996
00:33:45,530 --> 00:33:47,330
The dish is on the upper shelf.

997
00:33:48,030 --> 00:33:50,410
That means the dish
isn't of a big portion.

998
00:33:50,410 --> 00:33:51,570
- Exactly.
- Really?

999
00:33:51,570 --> 00:33:55,070
So Min, please describe the taste.

1000
00:33:55,380 --> 00:33:56,410
Well...

1001
00:33:57,620 --> 00:34:00,780
It's sweet and heavy.

1002
00:34:00,780 --> 00:34:02,010
- Right.
- Right?

1003
00:34:02,690 --> 00:34:05,220
It must be a dessert.
I say it's yogurt.

1004
00:34:05,220 --> 00:34:06,890
- Yes, a dessert.
- It must be.

1005
00:34:06,890 --> 00:34:07,960
- A piece of cake?
- A dessert.

1006
00:34:07,960 --> 00:34:08,960
It must be.

1007
00:34:08,960 --> 00:34:11,250
- Dong Jun seems flustered.
- Hold on.

1008
00:34:11,630 --> 00:34:13,150
Like we said, it's sweet but heavy.

1009
00:34:13,150 --> 00:34:15,860
- Then it's a dessert.
- A dessert.

1010
00:34:15,860 --> 00:34:18,130
- It's not a main dish.
- Something sweet?

1011
00:34:18,130 --> 00:34:20,570
To be honest, it's not a main dish.

1012
00:34:20,570 --> 00:34:23,460
But it can be served as a starter.

1013
00:34:23,460 --> 00:34:25,300
Right, but it can also
be a main dish.

1014
00:34:25,300 --> 00:34:26,400
- Of course.
- It can?

1015
00:34:26,400 --> 00:34:28,400
So Min, who would you
enjoy it with the most?

1016
00:34:28,400 --> 00:34:30,570
(Who would So Min
enjoy it with the most?)

1017
00:34:30,570 --> 00:34:32,780
With me.

1018
00:34:33,990 --> 00:34:35,820
(Her level of happiness
is at 200 percent.)

1019
00:34:35,940 --> 00:34:38,550
Dong Jun,
stop playing with her heart.

1020
00:34:38,550 --> 00:34:39,990
He's mean, isn't he?

1021
00:34:40,320 --> 00:34:42,920
- Dong Jun...
- I didn't think he'd be like this.

1022
00:34:42,920 --> 00:34:44,800
- He...
- Look at you being all cheeky.

1023
00:34:44,800 --> 00:34:46,490
- Have at it then.
- He's unbelievable.

1024
00:34:46,490 --> 00:34:48,420
So Min, have a seat.
We'll keep the questions coming.

1025
00:34:48,420 --> 00:34:50,570
Don't. My gosh.

1026
00:34:50,940 --> 00:34:52,690
Dong Jun, can we focus on our work?

1027
00:34:52,690 --> 00:34:54,340
- Gosh.
- She wants to work.

1028
00:34:54,340 --> 00:34:56,240
- What a player.
- You're the worst.

1029
00:34:56,240 --> 00:34:58,400
He's the kind of type to not let go.

1030
00:34:58,400 --> 00:35:00,380
- Right.
- I need him to promise something.

1031
00:35:00,380 --> 00:35:03,050
If you don't call me after today...

1032
00:35:03,710 --> 00:35:04,940
She's right.

1033
00:35:04,940 --> 00:35:06,780
I guess you didn't know
what she's like.

1034
00:35:06,940 --> 00:35:10,010
Dong Jun, you should
rush out of here once we're done.

1035
00:35:11,110 --> 00:35:13,650
"Start the van. Drive. Drive!"

1036
00:35:15,690 --> 00:35:16,760
But So Min will chase him.

1037
00:35:16,760 --> 00:35:18,230
(He will be escaping for his life.)

1038
00:35:18,230 --> 00:35:19,420
"Get him!"

1039
00:35:19,590 --> 00:35:21,960
I'll buy her this
when we meet again.

1040
00:35:22,400 --> 00:35:24,130
- The next time?
- You'll buy her this?

1041
00:35:24,130 --> 00:35:25,170
Really?

1042
00:35:25,570 --> 00:35:27,440
There's a place where they serve
a tasty one in my neighborhood.

1043
00:35:27,440 --> 00:35:28,510
Sounds good.

1044
00:35:28,860 --> 00:35:30,530
It must be a waffle!

1045
00:35:31,340 --> 00:35:32,510
(We got you.)

1046
00:35:32,510 --> 00:35:33,800
- Where she lives...
- It could be that.

1047
00:35:33,800 --> 00:35:36,210
There are famous waffle shops
near Sookmyung Women's University.

1048
00:35:36,210 --> 00:35:38,670
- A waffle.
- It must be a waffle.

1049
00:35:38,670 --> 00:35:41,920
It could be ice cream.
Something like vanilla ice cream.

1050
00:35:42,090 --> 00:35:43,920
It's the whole package.

1051
00:35:43,920 --> 00:35:45,380
- So please don't bid on it.
- He's right.

1052
00:35:45,380 --> 00:35:48,030
It's like one of those
snack packages.

1053
00:35:48,380 --> 00:35:50,650
I want a main dish though.

1054
00:35:50,820 --> 00:35:52,130
The auction will begin.

1055
00:35:52,130 --> 00:35:53,960
Dong Jun and So Min will bid first.

1056
00:35:53,960 --> 00:35:55,320
This will tell us.

1057
00:35:55,960 --> 00:35:58,360
They could bid less
just to throw us off.

1058
00:35:58,800 --> 00:36:00,530
- How about a dollar?
- How much will it be?

1059
00:36:01,110 --> 00:36:02,740
- A dollar?
- 1.5 dollars?

1060
00:36:02,740 --> 00:36:04,630
1.5 dollars? A dollar?

1061
00:36:04,630 --> 00:36:06,170
- A dollar.
- So it's a dollar.

1062
00:36:06,170 --> 00:36:07,880
You don't seem pleased at all.

1063
00:36:07,880 --> 00:36:10,150
- Can't we resell this?
- Sure.

1064
00:36:10,300 --> 00:36:12,420
- But this...
- It's not appealing, right?

1065
00:36:12,420 --> 00:36:13,570
- Not really.
- Me neither.

1066
00:36:13,710 --> 00:36:15,110
I can guarantee you this though.

1067
00:36:15,110 --> 00:36:17,650
- Jae Suk loves this dish too.
- Really?

1068
00:36:17,650 --> 00:36:19,490
I've seen him eat this a lot.

1069
00:36:19,490 --> 00:36:21,090
- Really?
- What about me?

1070
00:36:21,090 --> 00:36:24,030
I can bet all 10 fingers
on the fact that...

1071
00:36:24,030 --> 00:36:25,360
Suk Jin loves this dish.

1072
00:36:25,360 --> 00:36:26,490
1.7 dollars.

1073
00:36:27,320 --> 00:36:28,690
You won't regret it.

1074
00:36:28,690 --> 00:36:30,260
1.7 dollars.

1075
00:36:30,260 --> 00:36:32,190
Let me remind you that
you only have 50 cents.

1076
00:36:32,490 --> 00:36:34,360
- What?
- Really?

1077
00:36:34,360 --> 00:36:36,070
- You didn't know?
- We do?

1078
00:36:36,070 --> 00:36:37,280
- Seriously?
- And you're coveting the food?

1079
00:36:37,280 --> 00:36:38,510
- What are you talking about?
- You're broke!

1080
00:36:38,510 --> 00:36:39,840
You can't have the food for free.

1081
00:36:39,840 --> 00:36:41,940
- We have the money.
- You spent it all on the dice.

1082
00:36:41,940 --> 00:36:43,400
As far as we know,
you have 50 cents.

1083
00:36:43,400 --> 00:36:44,610
You guys are broke.

1084
00:36:44,610 --> 00:36:47,380
This is because you bought
all six sides.

1085
00:36:47,380 --> 00:36:49,440
So they're out of
the bidding war, right?

1086
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:51,960
- But we can take out a loan.
- Sure you can.

1087
00:36:51,960 --> 00:36:54,280
However, you'll have a higher chance
of coming in last.

1088
00:36:54,280 --> 00:36:56,420
Sure. But we should still eat first.

1089
00:36:56,550 --> 00:36:57,630
Then 1.7 dollars.

1090
00:36:57,630 --> 00:36:59,490
- We'll bid two dollars.
- No!

1091
00:36:59,960 --> 00:37:01,360
I won't go any higher.

1092
00:37:01,360 --> 00:37:03,300
- Don't be this way.
- Got it.

1093
00:37:03,570 --> 00:37:04,960
- Did they bid two dollars?
- Right.

1094
00:37:05,570 --> 00:37:07,670
- Then we bid 2.5 dollars.
- Sure, 2.5.

1095
00:37:07,670 --> 00:37:09,030
- Hold on.
- We don't have to eat,

1096
00:37:09,030 --> 00:37:10,710
- but we bid 2.7 dollars.
- Stop it!

1097
00:37:10,710 --> 00:37:12,480
That's our last bid. I mean it.

1098
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:13,900
Then we bid 2.8 dollars.

1099
00:37:13,900 --> 00:37:14,940
- Right.
- 2.8 dollars.

1100
00:37:14,940 --> 00:37:16,150
Three dollars!

1101
00:37:16,880 --> 00:37:18,510
- 3.1 dollars.
- My goodness.

1102
00:37:18,920 --> 00:37:20,840
We'll bid 3.5 dollars.

1103
00:37:21,050 --> 00:37:23,440
- Then we bid 3.6 dollars.
- 3.6 dollars.

1104
00:37:23,440 --> 00:37:25,490
That's too high for us
to compete with.

1105
00:37:25,490 --> 00:37:27,590
Don't you dare bid anymore.
This is ours to keep.

1106
00:37:27,590 --> 00:37:28,920
They're trying to trick us.

1107
00:37:28,920 --> 00:37:30,960
- Suk Jin, bid four dollars.
- They want it for themselves.

1108
00:37:30,960 --> 00:37:33,730
Zip it, will you?
Stop encouraging him!

1109
00:37:34,690 --> 00:37:35,690
You know how it is.

1110
00:37:35,690 --> 00:37:37,670
- Don't fall for it.
- Stop that.

1111
00:37:37,670 --> 00:37:38,740
Let me add this then.

1112
00:37:38,740 --> 00:37:41,840
Suk Jin has taken
many photos of this dish.

1113
00:37:41,840 --> 00:37:43,630
3.8 dollars!

1114
00:37:43,840 --> 00:37:45,570
(Smack!)

1115
00:37:45,710 --> 00:37:47,780
(He bids big for the pig in a poke.)

1116
00:37:47,780 --> 00:37:49,380
(That earns him
a smack on the head.)

1117
00:37:50,110 --> 00:37:51,670
What's wrong?

1118
00:37:51,670 --> 00:37:53,570
You're being smacked around today.

1119
00:37:53,570 --> 00:37:55,610
We're seeing
a truly battered spouse.

1120
00:37:55,610 --> 00:37:56,690
Are you kidding me?

1121
00:37:56,690 --> 00:37:58,860
I promise to make up for it
by earning more.

1122
00:37:59,360 --> 00:38:00,460
It's just...

1123
00:38:00,460 --> 00:38:02,780
(I'll do better from here on out.)

1124
00:38:03,760 --> 00:38:05,960
I promise to make up for it
by earning more.

1125
00:38:06,260 --> 00:38:08,070
I'll bring you a fatter paycheck.

1126
00:38:08,070 --> 00:38:10,170
- You bid 3.8 dollars.
- 3.8

1127
00:38:10,170 --> 00:38:11,240
(The highest bid is 3.8 dollars.)

1128
00:38:11,240 --> 00:38:12,740
- It's too expensive.
- It's too high.

1129
00:38:12,740 --> 00:38:13,760
3.8 dollars is too much.

1130
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:15,030
I can feel it, you know.

1131
00:38:15,030 --> 00:38:17,130
The dish is something worth eating.

1132
00:38:17,240 --> 00:38:20,480
5, 4, 3...

1133
00:38:20,570 --> 00:38:22,210
Four dollars.
I swear, that's my last bid.

1134
00:38:22,710 --> 00:38:23,710
(Not again!)

1135
00:38:23,710 --> 00:38:25,440
- I'll leave this with you now.
- You already promised.

1136
00:38:25,440 --> 00:38:26,550
No way!

1137
00:38:26,550 --> 00:38:28,050
- Listen to Won Young.
- No, no.

1138
00:38:28,050 --> 00:38:29,650
This will be my last bid.

1139
00:38:29,650 --> 00:38:31,820
- So Min's delighted.
- We can't even bid any higher.

1140
00:38:31,820 --> 00:38:33,650
Kwang Soo and Won Young
bid four dollars.

1141
00:38:33,650 --> 00:38:35,630
5, 4,

1142
00:38:36,260 --> 00:38:39,690
- 3, 2, 1.
- Unbelievable.

1143
00:38:39,690 --> 00:38:41,070
(Sold to Kwang Soo and Won Young
for 4 dollars.)

1144
00:38:41,070 --> 00:38:43,230
- Okay!
- Four dollars.

1145
00:38:43,230 --> 00:38:46,070
Suk Jin added a photo of this
to his profile page.

1146
00:38:46,070 --> 00:38:47,460
- His profile page?
- Mine?

1147
00:38:47,460 --> 00:38:49,210
- Yes, that's right.
- It's of lamb chops.

1148
00:38:49,360 --> 00:38:50,840
- 1, 2, 3.
- 2, 3.

1149
00:38:50,980 --> 00:38:55,150
(What did Kwang Soo
bid 4 dollars on?)

1150
00:38:56,150 --> 00:38:59,150
(TFS set:
Tteokbokki, fritters, and sundae)

1151
00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:01,990
You see?

1152
00:39:01,990 --> 00:39:04,380
- It's not bad!
- I said you'd like this.

1153
00:39:04,380 --> 00:39:06,420
- What did I tell you?
- It's not bad.

1154
00:39:06,710 --> 00:39:07,780
What the...

1155
00:39:08,860 --> 00:39:11,490
- This is my favorite.
- It was a good one.

1156
00:39:11,690 --> 00:39:14,400
- They look delicious.
- What did I tell you?

1157
00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:16,320
- They look tasty.
- I need to take a break.

1158
00:39:16,320 --> 00:39:18,070
- Are you okay?
- Yes, of course.

1159
00:39:18,070 --> 00:39:19,840
- I'm sorry, Suk Jin.
- Don't be.

1160
00:39:20,570 --> 00:39:22,300
(Haha and Mijoo are up next.)

1161
00:39:22,300 --> 00:39:23,740
Sniffing isn't allowed.

1162
00:39:23,740 --> 00:39:26,300
- That's equal to cheating.
- Don't you dare.

1163
00:39:26,630 --> 00:39:28,610
I can't believe
we lost the last round.

1164
00:39:28,610 --> 00:39:29,940
(After pondering,
they choose case number 3.)

1165
00:39:29,940 --> 00:39:31,610
- It's light.
- It must be.

1166
00:39:31,840 --> 00:39:33,940
- It's light.
- It sure is.

1167
00:39:34,610 --> 00:39:37,090
Can we sit this one out?

1168
00:39:37,090 --> 00:39:38,360
- It's light.
- No, it's heavy!

1169
00:39:38,760 --> 00:39:40,110
- It's light.
- It's extremely light.

1170
00:39:40,110 --> 00:39:42,880
His arm didn't show
any kind of tension.

1171
00:39:43,490 --> 00:39:45,730
It really must be light.

1172
00:39:45,730 --> 00:39:47,030
(After carrying it over with
difficulty, they drop it.)

1173
00:39:47,030 --> 00:39:48,360
I doubt it.

1174
00:39:48,360 --> 00:39:50,360
(Gosh, it's heavy.)

1175
00:39:51,170 --> 00:39:52,690
- I think they're snacks.
- Take a look.

1176
00:39:52,690 --> 00:39:54,860
I could tell by Haha's face.

1177
00:39:54,860 --> 00:39:56,440
(They cautiously
check what's inside.)

1178
00:39:56,440 --> 00:39:58,240
- No way.
- That was brief.

1179
00:39:58,240 --> 00:39:59,980
I can tell that
he's putting on an act.

1180
00:39:59,980 --> 00:40:01,440
He said, "No way" though.

1181
00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:03,070
Is it hot or cold?

1182
00:40:03,740 --> 00:40:05,780
- I like it when it's cold.
- Me too.

1183
00:40:05,780 --> 00:40:08,610
Tell us its color at the same time.

1184
00:40:09,320 --> 00:40:10,340
At the same time?

1185
00:40:10,340 --> 00:40:11,760
- 1, 2, 3.
- 2, 3.

1186
00:40:11,760 --> 00:40:12,880
- Green.
- Green.

1187
00:40:14,130 --> 00:40:15,280
(They weren't in sync.)

1188
00:40:15,280 --> 00:40:16,880
- Say it simultaneously.
- Why?

1189
00:40:16,880 --> 00:40:19,050
- I don't like green food.
- What food is green?

1190
00:40:19,050 --> 00:40:20,550
It must be a salad.

1191
00:40:20,550 --> 00:40:21,760
A salad?

1192
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:22,820
Is it a salad?

1193
00:40:22,820 --> 00:40:24,170
He said he likes it better
when it's cold.

1194
00:40:24,170 --> 00:40:26,340
- Maybe it's broccoli.
- I hate that.

1195
00:40:26,800 --> 00:40:28,630
It could be two pieces of broccoli.

1196
00:40:28,630 --> 00:40:30,630
Mijoo, when did you have it last?

1197
00:40:31,740 --> 00:40:32,740
About two years ago.

1198
00:40:32,740 --> 00:40:34,210
- Two years ago?
- It's not favored.

1199
00:40:34,210 --> 00:40:35,550
She doesn't eat it often.

1200
00:40:35,550 --> 00:40:37,570
I don't get to eat it often
because it's so good.

1201
00:40:37,570 --> 00:40:39,240
Eating this
leads to catching a cold.

1202
00:40:39,240 --> 00:40:41,320
- They're trying awfully hard.
- Something green?

1203
00:40:41,320 --> 00:40:43,010
- I doubt it's anything good.
- I don't think so either.

1204
00:40:43,010 --> 00:40:45,320
Also, what can be green?

1205
00:40:45,320 --> 00:40:46,860
Nothing I know that's green
is tasty.

1206
00:40:46,860 --> 00:40:48,050
It's time to bid.

1207
00:40:48,050 --> 00:40:49,780
Say something good about it.

1208
00:40:49,780 --> 00:40:51,050
Although, I doubt
it'll lead to a bid.

1209
00:40:52,360 --> 00:40:53,360
Guys...

1210
00:40:54,030 --> 00:40:56,070
- We'll start at 10 cents.
- See?

1211
00:40:56,460 --> 00:40:58,300
(He starts with the minimum bid.)

1212
00:40:58,570 --> 00:41:00,300
He could be bluffing.

1213
00:41:00,300 --> 00:41:01,510
No way.

1214
00:41:01,510 --> 00:41:03,030
It's too late for that.

1215
00:41:03,210 --> 00:41:04,710
We bid a dollar.

1216
00:41:04,710 --> 00:41:06,740
A dollar. That sounds good, right?

1217
00:41:06,740 --> 00:41:08,300
Won Young isn't pleased.

1218
00:41:08,300 --> 00:41:09,980
Won Young, they're bluffing.

1219
00:41:09,980 --> 00:41:12,050
- I think I chose the wrong partner.
- It sounds like a good deal. No.

1220
00:41:12,050 --> 00:41:14,380
- Over a dollar?
- You're just learning that?

1221
00:41:14,380 --> 00:41:16,110
- I just realized it.
- Over a dollar?

1222
00:41:16,110 --> 00:41:17,150
- Come on. It's not bad.
- What's wrong with you?

1223
00:41:17,150 --> 00:41:18,380
- A dollar?
- Yes, a dollar.

1224
00:41:18,380 --> 00:41:19,780
- What's wrong with you?
- Over here.

1225
00:41:19,780 --> 00:41:20,960
What if we end up having broccolis?

1226
00:41:20,960 --> 00:41:21,960
(Blocking)

1227
00:41:21,960 --> 00:41:23,050
Over here.

1228
00:41:23,320 --> 00:41:24,490
(Shut that hole.)

1229
00:41:24,490 --> 00:41:26,090
She hit him for real.

1230
00:41:26,090 --> 00:41:27,820
- She hit him.
- She actually hit him.

1231
00:41:28,530 --> 00:41:29,800
1.1 dollars.

1232
00:41:29,800 --> 00:41:31,070
- 1.1 dollars?
- Yes.

1233
00:41:31,530 --> 00:41:32,530
1.1 dollars.

1234
00:41:32,530 --> 00:41:34,860
Suk Jin, we'll go bankrupt
because of you.

1235
00:41:35,130 --> 00:41:36,460
You have five seconds.

1236
00:41:36,630 --> 00:41:37,940
- Unbelievable.
- Five.

1237
00:41:37,940 --> 00:41:39,280
- You can bid more.
- Four.

1238
00:41:39,840 --> 00:41:41,650
3, 2.

1239
00:41:42,010 --> 00:41:45,010
Two dollars!

1240
00:41:45,010 --> 00:41:46,170
- How much was it?
- What?

1241
00:41:46,170 --> 00:41:47,510
- They bid 2 dollars.
- 2 dollars?

1242
00:41:47,510 --> 00:41:49,010
- 2 dollars?
- Yes, 2 dollars.

1243
00:41:49,010 --> 00:41:50,650
- 2 dollars.
- 5...

1244
00:41:50,650 --> 00:41:51,920
- We're serious.
- Four.

1245
00:41:51,920 --> 00:41:54,460
Over here. I bid 2.3 dollars.

1246
00:41:54,460 --> 00:41:55,630
Are you insane?

1247
00:41:56,690 --> 00:41:59,130
- Darn you.
- She hit him again.

1248
00:41:59,130 --> 00:42:01,630
- Ji Hyo's furious.
- What's your problem?

1249
00:42:01,960 --> 00:42:04,630
- I want to eat that.
- It could be anything!

1250
00:42:04,630 --> 00:42:06,990
- But...
- Is it worth taking out a loan?

1251
00:42:06,990 --> 00:42:08,170
I mean...

1252
00:42:08,170 --> 00:42:09,460
This is a marital spat.

1253
00:42:09,460 --> 00:42:11,340
- Tell me about it.
- They're like a bickering couple.

1254
00:42:11,340 --> 00:42:15,240
The money we have
is enough for just that.

1255
00:42:15,440 --> 00:42:17,670
This is our only chance
to eat anything.

1256
00:42:17,670 --> 00:42:18,780
All right.

1257
00:42:18,780 --> 00:42:20,510
I'll say this again.

1258
00:42:21,320 --> 00:42:22,590
- Should we get it?
- Children love it.

1259
00:42:22,590 --> 00:42:24,190
- 2.3 dollars.
- 2.3 dollars.

1260
00:42:24,190 --> 00:42:25,260
Let's buy this.

1261
00:42:25,260 --> 00:42:28,420
The fact Haha keeps saying
good things about it...

1262
00:42:28,630 --> 00:42:29,650
Five,

1263
00:42:29,960 --> 00:42:31,230
four,

1264
00:42:31,230 --> 00:42:32,730
- three,
- Won't you bid more money?

1265
00:42:32,730 --> 00:42:34,090
- 2,
- Won't you bid 2.40 dollars?

1266
00:42:34,300 --> 00:42:35,300
one.

1267
00:42:35,760 --> 00:42:36,900
Congratulations.

1268
00:42:36,900 --> 00:42:38,400
What is it?

1269
00:42:38,570 --> 00:42:39,630
What is it?

1270
00:42:39,690 --> 00:42:40,900
Congratulations!

1271
00:42:41,900 --> 00:42:44,510
(2 banana milk?)

1272
00:42:45,400 --> 00:42:46,940
(Laughing)

1273
00:42:46,940 --> 00:42:48,880
I feel so bad.

1274
00:42:48,880 --> 00:42:50,710
He paid the proper price.

1275
00:42:50,710 --> 00:42:52,780
- These are nice.
- He paid the proper price.

1276
00:42:52,780 --> 00:42:54,240
- Ji Hyo.
- Thank goodness.

1277
00:42:54,240 --> 00:42:55,420
Thank goodness.

1278
00:42:55,420 --> 00:42:56,990
Ji Hyo. Ji Hyo.

1279
00:42:56,990 --> 00:42:58,690
(He got banana milk
as well as the delivery case.)

1280
00:42:58,690 --> 00:43:00,590
These are nice.

1281
00:43:00,590 --> 00:43:02,880
Ji Hyo, banana milk is good
for the skin.

1282
00:43:02,960 --> 00:43:04,230
It's good for the skin.

1283
00:43:04,230 --> 00:43:05,820
You can take the delivery case too.

1284
00:43:05,820 --> 00:43:07,150
Thank goodness.

1285
00:43:07,150 --> 00:43:08,230
It could have ended badly.

1286
00:43:08,230 --> 00:43:09,670
Kwang Soo, we are in your care.

1287
00:43:09,670 --> 00:43:11,240
(Kwang Soo and Won Young
are up next.)

1288
00:43:11,240 --> 00:43:12,630
I will tell you honestly.

1289
00:43:12,860 --> 00:43:14,460
We have to buy from now on.

1290
00:43:15,530 --> 00:43:16,900
- Case number seven?
- Sure.

1291
00:43:17,630 --> 00:43:19,380
- We choose case number seven.
- Okay.

1292
00:43:19,380 --> 00:43:20,380
(He chooses case number seven.)

1293
00:43:20,380 --> 00:43:21,800
- It seems to be heavy.
- There is food inside.

1294
00:43:21,800 --> 00:43:22,940
It's heavy.

1295
00:43:23,110 --> 00:43:25,280
We should eat it.

1296
00:43:26,050 --> 00:43:27,070
It's swaying too much.

1297
00:43:27,070 --> 00:43:28,110
- It's heavy.
- May I take a look?

1298
00:43:28,110 --> 00:43:30,090
- Of course not.
- It's swaying.

1299
00:43:30,090 --> 00:43:32,210
I hear the rattling sound.

1300
00:43:34,090 --> 00:43:35,530
(Hitting)

1301
00:43:36,460 --> 00:43:39,690
If there are no worries about
spilling, it can't be anything good.

1302
00:43:40,400 --> 00:43:42,230
(They scan the food first.)

1303
00:43:42,230 --> 00:43:43,860
(My goodness.)

1304
00:43:44,590 --> 00:43:46,990
Say the color of the food
at the same time.

1305
00:43:46,990 --> 00:43:48,300
1, 2, 3.

1306
00:43:48,300 --> 00:43:50,070
- Beige.
- Yellow mountain.

1307
00:43:50,240 --> 00:43:52,280
1, 2, 3.

1308
00:43:52,280 --> 00:43:53,800
- Beige.
- Yellow mountain.

1309
00:43:54,400 --> 00:43:55,670
What did you say?

1310
00:43:55,780 --> 00:43:57,210
Mountain?

1311
00:43:57,210 --> 00:43:58,670
- It's beige.
- Yellow.

1312
00:43:58,670 --> 00:44:00,710
- Mountain?
- I would say it's yellow.

1313
00:44:00,710 --> 00:44:01,840
Is it curry?

1314
00:44:01,840 --> 00:44:03,820
- Beige? Cream pasta?
- Yellow?

1315
00:44:04,610 --> 00:44:06,490
It must be pickled radish.

1316
00:44:06,490 --> 00:44:07,510
It must be!

1317
00:44:07,510 --> 00:44:09,030
It must be pickled radish
that comes with jjajangmyeon.

1318
00:44:09,030 --> 00:44:11,320
- Pickled radish is yellow or beige.
- Yellow or beige.

1319
00:44:11,320 --> 00:44:12,690
- You are right.
- That must be the case.

1320
00:44:12,690 --> 00:44:14,670
- For goodness' sake.
- That's not it.

1321
00:44:14,670 --> 00:44:16,760
Say how many words are
in the name of the dish.

1322
00:44:16,760 --> 00:44:18,130
1, 2, 3.

1323
00:44:18,130 --> 00:44:19,170
(Say how many words are
in the name of the dish.)

1324
00:44:19,630 --> 00:44:20,670
Two.

1325
00:44:20,740 --> 00:44:22,030
Won Young says two.

1326
00:44:22,030 --> 00:44:23,070
One.

1327
00:44:23,070 --> 00:44:24,300
(She changes the fingers.)

1328
00:44:24,300 --> 00:44:25,480
Won Young says two.

1329
00:44:25,480 --> 00:44:27,630
- 2?
- Won Young says 2.

1330
00:44:27,980 --> 00:44:29,740
The name of the dish
can be two words.

1331
00:44:29,740 --> 00:44:30,800
- Really?
- One word.

1332
00:44:30,800 --> 00:44:33,780
- It's something you crave.
- It's on the expensive side.

1333
00:44:33,780 --> 00:44:35,650
- Is it on the expensive side?
- Yes.

1334
00:44:35,650 --> 00:44:37,090
Let's start the bid now.

1335
00:44:37,090 --> 00:44:38,690
You won't be disappointed.

1336
00:44:38,690 --> 00:44:39,780
How much is the starting bid?

1337
00:44:39,990 --> 00:44:41,650
We will start at three dollars.

1338
00:44:41,650 --> 00:44:43,550
That seems excessive.
It's too expensive, right?

1339
00:44:43,550 --> 00:44:44,990
It's too expensive.

1340
00:44:44,990 --> 00:44:47,860
For some reason,
I don't want to bid on their dish.

1341
00:44:47,860 --> 00:44:49,030
Seriously.

1342
00:44:49,030 --> 00:44:50,570
Haha, shall all of us forgo a bid?

1343
00:44:50,570 --> 00:44:52,240
- Let's do that.
- The starting bid is three dollars.

1344
00:44:52,240 --> 00:44:54,630
- We haven't forgone a bid before.
- Shall we do that this time?

1345
00:44:54,630 --> 00:44:55,760
The starting bid is three dollars.

1346
00:44:55,760 --> 00:44:57,400
- Pay three dollars and eat it.
- It's too expensive.

1347
00:44:57,400 --> 00:44:59,210
- Shall we stay this way?
- In that case,

1348
00:44:59,300 --> 00:45:01,070
we will start at two dollars.

1349
00:45:01,380 --> 00:45:03,380
In that case,
we will start at two dollars.

1350
00:45:03,380 --> 00:45:05,170
- You can't do that.
- What are you doing?

1351
00:45:05,170 --> 00:45:06,880
- Wait a minute.
- You already said three dollars.

1352
00:45:06,880 --> 00:45:08,690
- Let's see the next one.
- You can have it.

1353
00:45:08,690 --> 00:45:09,940
There are many delivery cases left.

1354
00:45:09,940 --> 00:45:11,150
- Enjoy the dish.
- Three dollars. Enjoy it.

1355
00:45:11,150 --> 00:45:12,210
Take a look at the dish.

1356
00:45:12,210 --> 00:45:13,550
Thank you.

1357
00:45:14,050 --> 00:45:15,230
Stay.

1358
00:45:15,230 --> 00:45:17,050
- Stay.
- 5, 4,

1359
00:45:17,050 --> 00:45:18,420
- 3...
- We will bid 3.5 dollars.

1360
00:45:18,420 --> 00:45:20,150
- Okay. Go ahead and eat it.
- 3.5 dollars.

1361
00:45:20,550 --> 00:45:22,960
- Everyone, stay.
- Stay.

1362
00:45:22,960 --> 00:45:24,460
We will give you one more chance.

1363
00:45:24,460 --> 00:45:26,670
- 3.5 dollars?
- Are you sure you don't want it?

1364
00:45:26,670 --> 00:45:27,800
3.5 dollars.

1365
00:45:27,800 --> 00:45:28,800
- 3.5 dollars.
- Why don't you want it?

1366
00:45:28,800 --> 00:45:30,110
3.7 dollars.

1367
00:45:30,110 --> 00:45:31,510
- 3.7 dollars.
- 5,

1368
00:45:31,510 --> 00:45:33,440
- 4,
- Take it if you don't have food.

1369
00:45:33,440 --> 00:45:34,510
three,

1370
00:45:34,510 --> 00:45:35,940
two...

1371
00:45:35,940 --> 00:45:37,300
You really should take it.

1372
00:45:37,300 --> 00:45:38,820
- Okay.
- What could it be?

1373
00:45:38,820 --> 00:45:40,340
(Sold to Kwang Soo and Won Young
for 3.7 dollars.)

1374
00:45:40,440 --> 00:45:41,650
- What is it?
- What is it?

1375
00:45:41,650 --> 00:45:43,740
- Look at Won Young's face.
- Did you see her face?

1376
00:45:43,740 --> 00:45:44,760
Look at her face.

1377
00:45:44,760 --> 00:45:46,550
- She is swearing with her eyes.
- What is it?

1378
00:45:46,550 --> 00:45:48,380
- Why didn't he stop at 3 dollars?
- Seriously.

1379
00:45:48,380 --> 00:45:50,360
- He raised the bid.
- Why did he raise the bid?

1380
00:45:51,130 --> 00:45:52,300
- Why did he...
- What is it?

1381
00:45:52,300 --> 00:45:53,530
Why did he raise the bid?

1382
00:45:53,860 --> 00:45:54,960
- Is there no food?
- Pickled radish.

1383
00:45:54,960 --> 00:45:56,070
Boiled eggs.

1384
00:45:56,070 --> 00:45:57,760
(4 boiled eggs)

1385
00:45:58,760 --> 00:46:00,300
Good shot. Good shot.

1386
00:46:01,630 --> 00:46:02,860
(He ended up spending
3.7 dollars on eggs.)

1387
00:46:02,860 --> 00:46:04,670
They are perfect with the TFS set.

1388
00:46:04,670 --> 00:46:05,740
Good shot.

1389
00:46:05,740 --> 00:46:08,380
- It's a health dish.
- Okay.

1390
00:46:08,380 --> 00:46:10,070
We did well.

1391
00:46:10,070 --> 00:46:11,980
- Okay, okay.
- We did well.

1392
00:46:11,980 --> 00:46:13,980
Why did he raise the bid?

1393
00:46:13,980 --> 00:46:16,550
Se Chan almost fell for it.

1394
00:46:17,240 --> 00:46:18,690
That's too bad.

1395
00:46:18,690 --> 00:46:19,760
Let's bid this time.

1396
00:46:19,760 --> 00:46:20,820
Why did he do that?

1397
00:46:20,820 --> 00:46:22,530
Suk Jin's dish looks like
a good one.

1398
00:46:22,530 --> 00:46:23,630
(It's Suk Jin and Ji Hyo's turn.)

1399
00:46:23,690 --> 00:46:25,530
- We should bid this time.
- I know.

1400
00:46:25,530 --> 00:46:27,490
It's about time we get a nice dish.

1401
00:46:28,170 --> 00:46:29,730
(She maintains a poker face
as she looks inside.)

1402
00:46:29,730 --> 00:46:31,940
- The bottom shelf must be full.
- The bottom shelf must be full.

1403
00:46:32,690 --> 00:46:34,090
- Her eyes moved down.
- What could it be?

1404
00:46:34,090 --> 00:46:35,900
- The bottom shelf must be full.
- I know.

1405
00:46:35,900 --> 00:46:37,030
Ask us questions.

1406
00:46:37,400 --> 00:46:39,570
Say the color of the food
at the same time.

1407
00:46:39,570 --> 00:46:40,840
- 1, 2, 3.
- 1, 2, 3.

1408
00:46:40,840 --> 00:46:42,050
- Brown.
- Beige.

1409
00:46:42,340 --> 00:46:43,740
- Beige.
- Brown.

1410
00:46:43,740 --> 00:46:44,740
Brown.

1411
00:46:44,740 --> 00:46:46,480
- Is it curry?
- Is it chicken?

1412
00:46:46,480 --> 00:46:48,190
- Curry?
- It could be chicken.

1413
00:46:48,190 --> 00:46:49,650
- Chicken.
- How many words are in the name?

1414
00:46:49,650 --> 00:46:50,820
- 1, 2, 3.
- 1, 2, 3.

1415
00:46:50,820 --> 00:46:51,860
- 1 word.
- 1 word.

1416
00:46:51,860 --> 00:46:52,880
(They say it in unison.)

1417
00:46:52,880 --> 00:46:54,460
- Chicken.
- Chicken.

1418
00:46:54,590 --> 00:46:56,820
- Is it really chicken?
- I am not sure.

1419
00:46:57,320 --> 00:46:58,460
Gimbap?

1420
00:46:58,460 --> 00:46:59,760
- What?
- Gimbap.

1421
00:46:59,900 --> 00:47:01,300
Are you asking me if it's gimbap?

1422
00:47:01,300 --> 00:47:04,460
I think it's gimbap.
I'm just talking to myself.

1423
00:47:05,990 --> 00:47:07,030
(Why are you listening in?)

1424
00:47:07,030 --> 00:47:09,240
- I am talking to myself.
- But you spoke so loudly.

1425
00:47:09,240 --> 00:47:10,670
- I am talking to myself.
- You spoke so loudly.

1426
00:47:10,670 --> 00:47:11,980
I have a loud voice, okay?

1427
00:47:11,980 --> 00:47:13,400
Let's start bidding.

1428
00:47:13,400 --> 00:47:14,940
How much is the starting bid?

1429
00:47:15,280 --> 00:47:18,280
Shall we make it two dollars?

1430
00:47:19,010 --> 00:47:20,070
- 1.5 dollars?
- 1.5 dollars.

1431
00:47:20,070 --> 00:47:21,320
Let's start at 1.5 dollars.

1432
00:47:21,320 --> 00:47:23,780
They will make us spend money.

1433
00:47:34,330 --> 00:47:36,510
(What kind of food has
the starting bid of 1.5 dollars?)

1434
00:47:36,830 --> 00:47:39,600
(Hardtack)

1435
00:47:39,600 --> 00:47:41,410
I bet it's something tasty.

1436
00:47:41,540 --> 00:47:44,810
When they made the starting bid
1.5 dollars,

1437
00:47:44,810 --> 00:47:46,240
their eyes met.

1438
00:47:46,240 --> 00:47:47,970
- Ji Hyo was unwavering.
- Ji Hyo...

1439
00:47:47,970 --> 00:47:49,220
agreed with the price.

1440
00:47:49,290 --> 00:47:51,410
- We will bid 2 dollars.
- 2 dollars.

1441
00:47:51,510 --> 00:47:54,310
It's about time
we get something nice.

1442
00:47:54,310 --> 00:47:55,490
We will bid 2.5 dollars.

1443
00:47:55,490 --> 00:47:57,450
- 2.5 dollars.
- 2.8 dollars.

1444
00:47:57,450 --> 00:47:58,600
- 2.8 dollars.
- 3 dollars.

1445
00:47:58,600 --> 00:47:59,790
- Stop.
- 3.2 dollars.

1446
00:47:59,790 --> 00:48:00,830
3.2 dollars.

1447
00:48:00,830 --> 00:48:02,600
- 3.5 dollars.
- 3.5 dollars.

1448
00:48:02,660 --> 00:48:04,100
- 4 dollars.
- 4 dollars.

1449
00:48:04,100 --> 00:48:05,700
- Four dollars?
- Let's wait.

1450
00:48:06,370 --> 00:48:08,140
Let's bid 4.5 dollars
and eat the dish.

1451
00:48:08,510 --> 00:48:09,660
No, no.

1452
00:48:09,660 --> 00:48:11,410
Let's wait.
The price might go up.

1453
00:48:11,410 --> 00:48:12,910
We will bid 4.5 dollars.

1454
00:48:12,930 --> 00:48:14,010
Five,

1455
00:48:14,180 --> 00:48:15,200
four,

1456
00:48:15,540 --> 00:48:16,950
- three,
- We will eat it.

1457
00:48:16,950 --> 00:48:17,970
two,

1458
00:48:18,180 --> 00:48:19,180
one.

1459
00:48:19,370 --> 00:48:22,180
- 4.5 dollars.
- 4.5 dollars?

1460
00:48:22,180 --> 00:48:23,310
- Really?
- Then how much are they in debt?

1461
00:48:23,310 --> 00:48:24,720
4.5 dollars is a hefty price.

1462
00:48:24,720 --> 00:48:25,850
They are in a lot of debt.

1463
00:48:25,850 --> 00:48:27,660
Then they will be
at the very bottom.

1464
00:48:27,660 --> 00:48:29,260
We have no hopes of winning.

1465
00:48:29,490 --> 00:48:30,930
- That's right.
- We will have a good meal.

1466
00:48:30,930 --> 00:48:32,390
We will have a good meal
before we go down.

1467
00:48:32,390 --> 00:48:35,160
- We will have a good meal.
- We will have a good meal.

1468
00:48:35,290 --> 00:48:36,530
They are in a lot of debt.

1469
00:48:36,530 --> 00:48:38,370
Then they will be
at the very bottom.

1470
00:48:38,370 --> 00:48:40,390
- Shall we join forces again and...
- Stay?

1471
00:48:40,390 --> 00:48:41,490
- Stay.
- Stay.

1472
00:48:41,490 --> 00:48:43,330
Would it be okay if we join forces?

1473
00:48:43,330 --> 00:48:44,430
That's a good idea.

1474
00:48:44,430 --> 00:48:45,930
Let's give them tasty food.

1475
00:48:45,930 --> 00:48:47,180
- Okay.
- What?

1476
00:48:47,180 --> 00:48:48,470
- Eat.
- It's 4.5 dollars.

1477
00:48:48,470 --> 00:48:49,540
You should eat tasty food.

1478
00:48:49,540 --> 00:48:50,700
- Hold on.
- You deserve to eat.

1479
00:48:50,700 --> 00:48:52,180
You should bid more money.

1480
00:48:52,180 --> 00:48:53,510
- You should eat tasty food.
- No, no.

1481
00:48:53,510 --> 00:48:54,540
- Stay.
- You can have it.

1482
00:48:54,540 --> 00:48:59,580
Why are you controlling them,
you punk?

1483
00:48:59,580 --> 00:49:00,810
- He is trying to back down.
- You can have it.

1484
00:49:00,810 --> 00:49:03,990
If you bid five dollars,
we might give up.

1485
00:49:04,580 --> 00:49:06,990
It's important to make them use
a lot of money.

1486
00:49:06,990 --> 00:49:08,450
- They used a lot of money.
- Let's make them use more.

1487
00:49:08,450 --> 00:49:11,100
- 5,
- If we spend 4.5 dollars on it...

1488
00:49:11,100 --> 00:49:12,540
- four,
- Let's just eat it.

1489
00:49:12,540 --> 00:49:13,890
- three,
- Doesn't anyone want to bid?

1490
00:49:14,200 --> 00:49:15,260
two...

1491
00:49:15,260 --> 00:49:16,910
- It must be something tasty.
- I know.

1492
00:49:16,910 --> 00:49:17,910
One.

1493
00:49:18,370 --> 00:49:20,370
Okay. Let's enjoy the food.

1494
00:49:20,370 --> 00:49:22,010
That's right. It will be nice
to eat tasty food.

1495
00:49:22,010 --> 00:49:23,810
It will fill us up.

1496
00:49:24,780 --> 00:49:25,850
(Hardtack)

1497
00:49:26,910 --> 00:49:28,720
Thank goodness we stayed!

1498
00:49:30,680 --> 00:49:32,450
(Thank goodness we stayed!)

1499
00:49:32,450 --> 00:49:33,660
Okay!

1500
00:49:33,660 --> 00:49:35,390
It was hardtack.

1501
00:49:35,530 --> 00:49:36,890
We did well by raising the bid.

1502
00:49:36,890 --> 00:49:38,350
- What is this?
- We did well by raising the bid.

1503
00:49:38,350 --> 00:49:41,200
You should have let another team
spend four dollars.

1504
00:49:41,350 --> 00:49:42,660
I thought someone would outbid us.

1505
00:49:42,660 --> 00:49:44,030
You should have let another team
spend four dollars.

1506
00:49:44,030 --> 00:49:46,200
I thought someone would bid
five dollars.

1507
00:49:46,200 --> 00:49:48,260
Suk Jin and I don't get along.

1508
00:49:48,260 --> 00:49:50,060
It's hard to make people spend
more than four dollars.

1509
00:49:50,060 --> 00:49:51,910
Hardtack is...

1510
00:49:51,910 --> 00:49:54,100
very filling.

1511
00:49:54,100 --> 00:49:57,240
If you drink water with it,

1512
00:49:57,240 --> 00:49:59,240
you will be full.

1513
00:49:59,410 --> 00:50:03,510
(Current Amount of Money)

1514
00:50:03,580 --> 00:50:05,390
- It's tasty.
- You got jjajangmyeon.

1515
00:50:05,390 --> 00:50:07,220
- I am full.
- Let's go.

1516
00:50:07,410 --> 00:50:08,620
(They are waiting inside the bus.)

1517
00:50:08,620 --> 00:50:09,660
Your song is nice.

1518
00:50:11,790 --> 00:50:13,200
(What?)

1519
00:50:13,200 --> 00:50:14,450
Shall we take a selfie together?

1520
00:50:16,660 --> 00:50:17,660
What?

1521
00:50:17,930 --> 00:50:19,660
I was taking a selfie.

1522
00:50:19,790 --> 00:50:21,560
- When I looked to the side...
- I was taking a selfie.

1523
00:50:21,560 --> 00:50:23,830
(A good angle)

1524
00:50:23,830 --> 00:50:26,180
Shall we take a selfie together?

1525
00:50:26,180 --> 00:50:27,200
(They are cute.)

1526
00:50:27,680 --> 00:50:29,140
(An unexpected selfie)

1527
00:50:29,140 --> 00:50:31,700
- Thank you.
- Don't mention it.

1528
00:50:31,700 --> 00:50:33,540
- Shall I send it to you?
- Sure.

1529
00:50:34,510 --> 00:50:35,910
How do I send it to you?

1530
00:50:37,080 --> 00:50:39,080
(I need her number
to receive the photo.)

1531
00:50:40,160 --> 00:50:41,350
(He gets ready to get her number.)

1532
00:50:41,390 --> 00:50:42,790
What?

1533
00:50:43,060 --> 00:50:44,580
Shall I share it via AirDrop?

1534
00:50:44,580 --> 00:50:45,600
(Shall I share it via AirDrop?)

1535
00:50:46,120 --> 00:50:47,220
How do I do it?

1536
00:50:47,220 --> 00:50:48,330
(Kids these days share photos
via AirDrop.)

1537
00:50:48,330 --> 00:50:49,720
That must be my phone.

1538
00:50:49,720 --> 00:50:52,990
I share photos this way.

1539
00:50:52,990 --> 00:50:54,330
(The old and the young
share a photo.)

1540
00:50:54,330 --> 00:50:56,260
Hold on tight. We will hit the road.

1541
00:50:56,310 --> 00:50:57,970
Se Chan is in good condition.

1542
00:50:57,970 --> 00:50:59,010
Yes.

1543
00:50:59,010 --> 00:51:00,140
Yuqi, where are you from?

1544
00:51:00,140 --> 00:51:02,180
- Beijing.
- Beijing?

1545
00:51:02,180 --> 00:51:04,180
- Beijing?
- Yes, Beijing.

1546
00:51:04,180 --> 00:51:06,240
- She is from Beijing.
- I know the city well.

1547
00:51:06,240 --> 00:51:08,220
I visited it so many times.
I visited it as if it were my home.

1548
00:51:08,220 --> 00:51:09,510
- You mean Beijing?
- Yes.

1549
00:51:09,510 --> 00:51:11,490
- I see.
- One time,

1550
00:51:11,490 --> 00:51:13,620
Jong Kook got on the plane
by chance...

1551
00:51:13,620 --> 00:51:16,120
with other girl groups.

1552
00:51:16,120 --> 00:51:18,450
We were going to an event in China.

1553
00:51:18,720 --> 00:51:20,260
As soon as he got off,

1554
00:51:20,260 --> 00:51:22,620
his fans crowded the airport.

1555
00:51:22,620 --> 00:51:25,830
- His fans crowded the airport.
- He is a Korean Wave star.

1556
00:51:25,830 --> 00:51:26,930
- Seriously.
- "Jong Kook!"

1557
00:51:26,930 --> 00:51:29,100
They thought the same thing
would happen with Suk Jin,

1558
00:51:29,100 --> 00:51:30,470
so 20 bodyguards came for him.

1559
00:51:30,660 --> 00:51:31,970
They were as relaxed as ever.

1560
00:51:31,970 --> 00:51:34,240
They seemed confused.

1561
00:51:34,430 --> 00:51:35,810
- It was the easiest job.
- It was the easiest job.

1562
00:51:35,810 --> 00:51:36,810
That's right.

1563
00:51:36,810 --> 00:51:39,040
I told them to go back.

1564
00:51:39,080 --> 00:51:40,080
Seriously.

1565
00:51:40,080 --> 00:51:42,310
The bodyguarding agency goes wild
when Suk Jin is coming.

1566
00:51:42,450 --> 00:51:44,080
"I will take the job!"

1567
00:51:44,510 --> 00:51:46,490
- It's the easiest job.
- "The easiest job".

1568
00:51:46,850 --> 00:51:48,450
Mijoo, what will you do
from now on?

1569
00:51:48,580 --> 00:51:49,850
- Me?
- Yes.

1570
00:51:49,930 --> 00:51:51,080
Will you keep going that way?

1571
00:51:51,080 --> 00:51:52,890
Will you switch over
to the variety shows?

1572
00:51:52,890 --> 00:51:54,030
- You should.
- You should.

1573
00:51:54,030 --> 00:51:55,100
I should.

1574
00:51:55,100 --> 00:51:58,100
Do you have a role model
in variety shows?

1575
00:51:58,260 --> 00:52:00,740
- Lee Hyo Lee.
- Lee Hyo Lee? I see.

1576
00:52:00,740 --> 00:52:02,370
- Lee Hyo Lee.
- How about you, Doyeon?

1577
00:52:02,370 --> 00:52:03,540
Who is your role model?

1578
00:52:03,540 --> 00:52:05,330
I admire Lim Soo Jung.

1579
00:52:05,330 --> 00:52:07,970
- An actress.
- I see the resemblance.

1580
00:52:07,970 --> 00:52:09,470
She was in "Lump of Sugar".

1581
00:52:09,740 --> 00:52:11,410
- That's such an old movie.
- That's such an old movie.

1582
00:52:11,410 --> 00:52:13,040
"Lump of Sugar" came out ages ago.

1583
00:52:13,040 --> 00:52:14,310
- "Lump of Sugar".
- It's a really old movie.

1584
00:52:14,310 --> 00:52:16,120
Out of all the movies she was in...

1585
00:52:16,240 --> 00:52:18,720
I watched "Lump of Sugar".

1586
00:52:18,720 --> 00:52:19,720
How about you, Dong Jun?

1587
00:52:19,720 --> 00:52:21,160
Dong Jun is going into acting.

1588
00:52:21,160 --> 00:52:22,720
- He is going into acting.
- Acting.

1589
00:52:22,720 --> 00:52:24,120
My role model
is Jong Kook, of course.

1590
00:52:24,120 --> 00:52:25,530
- I want to bulk up.
- What are you saying?

1591
00:52:25,530 --> 00:52:27,330
- He wants a body like Jong Kook's.
- I guess you like to work out.

1592
00:52:27,330 --> 00:52:30,200
Do you want to own a gym?

1593
00:52:30,260 --> 00:52:31,620
- When I worked out a lot...
- Listen.

1594
00:52:31,620 --> 00:52:34,160
If Dong Jun has a nicer body
to go with that face,

1595
00:52:34,160 --> 00:52:35,510
he would look incredible.

1596
00:52:35,510 --> 00:52:37,910
Women don't like a man
whose body is too perfect.

1597
00:52:37,910 --> 00:52:38,910
- What?
- That's right.

1598
00:52:38,910 --> 00:52:41,540
- If his body is too bulky...
- You shouldn't enforce your idea.

1599
00:52:41,540 --> 00:52:42,540
I am serious.

1600
00:52:42,540 --> 00:52:45,200
You just touched a raw nerve.

1601
00:52:45,200 --> 00:52:47,810
- You...
- It's okay, Jong Kook.

1602
00:52:47,810 --> 00:52:49,620
- Don't tease him.
- He hates those words the most.

1603
00:52:49,620 --> 00:52:51,310
Jong Kook is a bit angry.

1604
00:52:51,310 --> 00:52:52,720
- He is proud of his body.
- All right.

1605
00:52:52,720 --> 00:52:55,720
All right. It's okay.
It's not wrong to think that.

1606
00:52:55,720 --> 00:52:58,350
Jong Kook got annoyed with So Min
for the first time in a long while.

1607
00:52:58,350 --> 00:52:59,950
How about you, Won Young?

1608
00:52:59,950 --> 00:53:04,060
I admire Jun Ji Hyun.

1609
00:53:05,600 --> 00:53:07,140
Oh, Jun Ji Hyun?

1610
00:53:07,140 --> 00:53:09,100
- She has that vibe.
- Ji Hyun.

1611
00:53:09,100 --> 00:53:10,430
- She has that vibe.
- Are you close to her?

1612
00:53:10,430 --> 00:53:12,240
- What?
- Don't you know Jun Ji Hyun well?

1613
00:53:12,240 --> 00:53:13,370
Have you met her or not?

1614
00:53:13,370 --> 00:53:14,970
We once filmed a commercial
together.

1615
00:53:14,970 --> 00:53:16,350
- Which commercial was it?
- She must be the only one...

1616
00:53:16,350 --> 00:53:17,810
you can't call by her first name.

1617
00:53:17,810 --> 00:53:18,970
- What?
- You can't call her Ji Hyun, right?

1618
00:53:18,970 --> 00:53:20,410
No, I can't.

1619
00:53:20,410 --> 00:53:22,950
(He is sure of it.)

1620
00:53:22,950 --> 00:53:24,310
- Really?
- Really? I want to see that.

1621
00:53:24,310 --> 00:53:26,410
I can't speak casually to her.

1622
00:53:26,410 --> 00:53:27,720
- Really?
- Yes.

1623
00:53:27,720 --> 00:53:29,030
- I want to see that.
- I can't speak casually to her.

1624
00:53:29,030 --> 00:53:30,430
- I see.
- I can't do that with Jun Ji Hyun.

1625
00:53:30,430 --> 00:53:33,260
I can speak casually to Won Young,

1626
00:53:33,260 --> 00:53:36,220
but it's different with Jun Ji Hyun.

1627
00:53:36,220 --> 00:53:38,060
Kwang Soo, who is your role model?

1628
00:53:38,160 --> 00:53:40,330
- Isn't it Han Gi Beom?
- It must be Han Gi Beom.

1629
00:53:40,330 --> 00:53:41,600
- Han Gi Beom.
- I like him,

1630
00:53:41,600 --> 00:53:43,510
but he isn't my role model.
He is an athlete.

1631
00:53:43,740 --> 00:53:45,100
- How about an actor?
- Yao Ming!

1632
00:53:45,100 --> 00:53:46,330
(Yao Ming!)

1633
00:53:46,330 --> 00:53:47,330
Hey!

1634
00:53:48,010 --> 00:53:49,080
A basketball player.

1635
00:53:49,080 --> 00:53:50,950
Why would Yao Ming
be my role model?

1636
00:53:50,950 --> 00:53:52,780
Since he's very tall...

1637
00:53:52,850 --> 00:53:54,720
Why would Yao Ming
be my role model?

1638
00:53:54,720 --> 00:53:56,790
- Yao Ming.
- Your face reminds me...

1639
00:53:56,790 --> 00:53:59,010
of the Chinese version
of "Produce 101".

1640
00:53:59,010 --> 00:54:00,220
That trainee.

1641
00:54:00,220 --> 00:54:02,260
There is one trainee
who looks exactly like you.

1642
00:54:02,260 --> 00:54:04,220
There is one comment I remember.

1643
00:54:04,220 --> 00:54:05,390
What is it?

1644
00:54:05,490 --> 00:54:08,330
"I can't stand seeing someone
with Kwang Soo's face act cool."

1645
00:54:09,390 --> 00:54:10,600
(Kwang Soo can't argue with that.)

1646
00:54:10,600 --> 00:54:11,600
For goodness' sake.

1647
00:54:11,600 --> 00:54:13,260
I still refuse to believe
he is a different person.

1648
00:54:13,260 --> 00:54:14,790
- He is Kwang Soo.
- It's so funny.

1649
00:54:14,790 --> 00:54:17,140
How did you go back and forth?

1650
00:54:17,240 --> 00:54:18,700
What are you talking about?

1651
00:54:18,700 --> 00:54:20,100
- It was you.
- It was you.

1652
00:54:20,100 --> 00:54:21,970
When did you learn Chinese?

1653
00:54:21,970 --> 00:54:24,010
- What?
- You spoke Chinese like a native.

1654
00:54:24,040 --> 00:54:25,620
What are you talking about?

1655
00:54:25,620 --> 00:54:27,810
That trainee looked
exactly like you.

1656
00:54:27,970 --> 00:54:31,310
I think Doyeon is pretty happy
to be Se Chan's partner.

1657
00:54:31,510 --> 00:54:32,810
- Doyeon is.
- Me?

1658
00:54:32,810 --> 00:54:34,120
- Me?
- Doyeon,

1659
00:54:34,120 --> 00:54:35,620
have you always been
a fan of Se Chan?

1660
00:54:35,620 --> 00:54:36,950
- Yes.
- Really?

1661
00:54:36,950 --> 00:54:38,080
- Why do you like him?
- We have...

1662
00:54:38,080 --> 00:54:39,790
- a similar sense of humor.
- Really?

1663
00:54:39,790 --> 00:54:41,100
- Really?
- I guess you like it...

1664
00:54:41,100 --> 00:54:42,870
when comedians paint on their faces.

1665
00:54:42,870 --> 00:54:45,220
- How do you see him as a man?
- I am curious.

1666
00:54:45,890 --> 00:54:46,890
What do you think?

1667
00:54:47,100 --> 00:54:48,160
- My goodness.
- Did you just laugh?

1668
00:54:48,160 --> 00:54:49,200
She became so startled.

1669
00:54:49,200 --> 00:54:51,240
How would you rate my looks
from 1 to 10?

1670
00:54:51,240 --> 00:54:52,600
Why would you ask her that?

1671
00:54:52,600 --> 00:54:54,040
- Why would you ask her that?
- Your looks can't be rated...

1672
00:54:54,040 --> 00:54:55,100
from 1 to 10.

1673
00:54:55,100 --> 00:54:56,700
Why not? Why not?

1674
00:54:56,700 --> 00:54:57,740
- You need to go lower.
- There is one.

1675
00:54:57,740 --> 00:54:59,510
- We need negative numbers.
- We need negative numbers.

1676
00:54:59,510 --> 00:55:00,720
You can just pick a number.

1677
00:55:00,720 --> 00:55:02,450
Se Chan is a junior
I really cherish.

1678
00:55:02,450 --> 00:55:04,220
Overall, he is a good man.

1679
00:55:04,220 --> 00:55:06,180
He is really fine
when you see him from afar.

1680
00:55:06,310 --> 00:55:08,310
When you see him from 4km away...

1681
00:55:08,310 --> 00:55:09,580
- 4km?
- Seriously.

1682
00:55:09,580 --> 00:55:11,060
- That's ridiculous.
- Then he wouldn't be visible.

1683
00:55:11,060 --> 00:55:12,530
He is handsome when he wears a mask.

1684
00:55:12,530 --> 00:55:14,160
That's right.
He looks cool when he wears a mask.

1685
00:55:14,330 --> 00:55:16,430
Se Chan isn't half bad.

1686
00:55:16,430 --> 00:55:17,700
- That's right.
- He is fine.

1687
00:55:17,700 --> 00:55:19,870
- Se Chan isn't half bad.
- He is nice.

1688
00:55:20,600 --> 00:55:22,830
We are talking among ourselves.

1689
00:55:22,830 --> 00:55:24,160
None of the guests are agreeing.

1690
00:55:24,160 --> 00:55:26,280
- None of the guests are agreeing.
- Seriously.

1691
00:55:26,280 --> 00:55:27,830
(The guests stay silent.)

1692
00:55:27,830 --> 00:55:28,950
"That's right."

1693
00:55:28,950 --> 00:55:30,450
"He has nice looks."
You could have said that once.

1694
00:55:30,450 --> 00:55:31,640
We are talking among ourselves.

1695
00:55:31,640 --> 00:55:33,850
I saw everyone
look outside the window.

1696
00:55:33,910 --> 00:55:36,240
All the members are nice.

1697
00:55:36,240 --> 00:55:38,080
- That's right.
- Jong Kook is nice.

1698
00:55:38,080 --> 00:55:39,620
- All of us are kind.
- So Min too.

1699
00:55:39,620 --> 00:55:41,310
- All of us have a nice personality.
- Kwang Soo too.

1700
00:55:41,620 --> 00:55:43,030
They want us to come this way.

1701
00:55:43,030 --> 00:55:44,080
What is this?

1702
00:55:44,180 --> 00:55:46,390
I don't know. Is this soy milk?

1703
00:55:46,600 --> 00:55:48,030
- Is it flour?
- Is it flour?

1704
00:55:48,030 --> 00:55:49,120
Flour is good for the skin.

1705
00:55:49,120 --> 00:55:50,370
I think my skin will improve.

1706
00:55:50,370 --> 00:55:51,790
It's good for brightening the skin.

1707
00:55:52,370 --> 00:55:53,970
I am optimistic, right?

1708
00:55:54,700 --> 00:55:56,040
Why aren't the others coming?

1709
00:55:56,160 --> 00:55:58,260
It will be funny if we fall over.

1710
00:55:58,370 --> 00:56:00,580
- This is fun.
- You might fall backward.

1711
00:56:01,740 --> 00:56:03,180
If I were close to you,
I would have pushed you.

1712
00:56:03,740 --> 00:56:05,410
If I were close to you,
I would have pushed you.

1713
00:56:05,410 --> 00:56:07,680
- You would have pushed me?
- Of course.

1714
00:56:09,080 --> 00:56:11,140
(They gather around one by one.)

1715
00:56:11,140 --> 00:56:12,220
My goodness.

1716
00:56:12,220 --> 00:56:14,850
- What's taking them so long?
- I know.

1717
00:56:17,080 --> 00:56:19,330
(What is going on all of a sudden?)

1718
00:56:20,660 --> 00:56:22,870
Ji Hyo is mischievous.

1719
00:56:22,870 --> 00:56:24,030
Come on.

1720
00:56:24,030 --> 00:56:27,240
(She couldn't help
but pull a prank.)

1721
00:56:27,240 --> 00:56:28,640
(She seems so excited
after pulling a prank.)

1722
00:56:28,640 --> 00:56:32,240
Okay. Okay.

1723
00:56:32,240 --> 00:56:34,970
Ji Hyo found someone
in her weight division today.

1724
00:56:35,370 --> 00:56:38,140
(The rest of the members enter.)

1725
00:56:38,580 --> 00:56:39,620
It's flour.

1726
00:56:39,720 --> 00:56:41,120
Oh, it's flour?

1727
00:56:41,620 --> 00:56:43,720
If we fry Kwang Soo in there,

1728
00:56:43,720 --> 00:56:45,350
he will look like a fried loach.

1729
00:56:45,350 --> 00:56:47,490
(If we fry Kwang Soo in there,
he will look like a fried loach.)

1730
00:56:47,950 --> 00:56:50,160
- Why would you fry me in there?
- He looks like a loach.

1731
00:56:50,490 --> 00:56:52,530
Se Chan will be fried catfish.

1732
00:56:52,530 --> 00:56:54,830
This is the last mission
for the prize money,

1733
00:56:54,830 --> 00:56:56,530
the Sinking Three-Legged Race.

1734
00:56:56,530 --> 00:56:57,600
What?

1735
00:56:58,030 --> 00:56:59,830
In each round of the tournament,
two couples will participate.

1736
00:56:59,830 --> 00:57:02,740
You will get the prize money
in accordance with the results.

1737
00:57:02,740 --> 00:57:06,040
In 100 seconds,
the couples will tie their feet...

1738
00:57:06,040 --> 00:57:09,280
and move as many balls
from the other team's area...

1739
00:57:09,280 --> 00:57:11,200
to their basket.

1740
00:57:11,410 --> 00:57:13,780
The team that moves more balls
will win...

1741
00:57:13,780 --> 00:57:15,680
and move on to the next round.

1742
00:57:15,680 --> 00:57:16,890
If you lose, it's over.

1743
00:57:16,890 --> 00:57:20,120
Yes. The prize money you receive
will reflect the results.

1744
00:57:20,120 --> 00:57:22,330
- The prize money.
- The winners will get more money...

1745
00:57:22,330 --> 00:57:23,580
since they can move on
to the next round.

1746
00:57:23,580 --> 00:57:25,930
So it's important
to avoid Jong Kook's team...

1747
00:57:25,930 --> 00:57:27,700
in the preliminaries.

1748
00:57:27,700 --> 00:57:29,530
I'm sorry, but are you talking
with your back to us?

1749
00:57:29,530 --> 00:57:31,600
- How could you do that?
- He refuses to go against them.

1750
00:57:31,600 --> 00:57:33,430
Are you talking
with your back to us?

1751
00:57:33,430 --> 00:57:36,740
The healthy couple is scary.

1752
00:57:36,740 --> 00:57:41,540
- For goodness' sake.
- This is the starch pool.

1753
00:57:41,540 --> 00:57:43,970
If you run fast,
it will feel like the ground.

1754
00:57:43,970 --> 00:57:45,680
If you stay still,
your feet will sink.

1755
00:57:45,680 --> 00:57:47,620
- Really?
- Yes.

1756
00:57:47,620 --> 00:57:49,410
So it's important to run fast.

1757
00:57:49,410 --> 00:57:50,510
It has nothing to do with strength.

1758
00:57:50,510 --> 00:57:51,810
We need to move fast.

1759
00:57:51,810 --> 00:57:54,850
Stop turning your back to us.
It has nothing to do with strength.

1760
00:57:54,850 --> 00:57:57,350
Soyou, stop hitting me
when you talk to me.

1761
00:57:57,350 --> 00:57:59,930
- Stand like this.
- Female members, take a pick.

1762
00:57:59,930 --> 00:58:01,990
The teams with the same number
will go against each other.

1763
00:58:01,990 --> 00:58:03,970
Number four will win by default.

1764
00:58:03,970 --> 00:58:05,060
(Current Amount of Money)

1765
00:58:05,060 --> 00:58:06,140
(Suk Jin and Ji Hyo
versus Haha and Mijoo)

1766
00:58:06,140 --> 00:58:07,240
(So Min and Dong Jun
versus Jong Kook and Soyou)

1767
00:58:07,240 --> 00:58:08,540
- Please.
- We need to win.

1768
00:58:08,540 --> 00:58:10,540
It'll be good to pick number four
and win by default.

1769
00:58:12,140 --> 00:58:13,240
All right.

1770
00:58:13,370 --> 00:58:15,510
- Okay.
- What?

1771
00:58:15,510 --> 00:58:16,680
What is it?

1772
00:58:17,370 --> 00:58:19,870
(What is this?)

1773
00:58:20,280 --> 00:58:21,910
Make sure your feet
touch the ground.

1774
00:58:21,910 --> 00:58:23,510
You need to move fast.

1775
00:58:23,510 --> 00:58:25,240
- I can't move.
- Is it okay if you run fast?

1776
00:58:25,240 --> 00:58:26,850
- It's like the mudflat.
- I can't take my feet out.

1777
00:58:26,850 --> 00:58:28,010
She is good!

1778
00:58:28,510 --> 00:58:30,330
- It's like the mudflat.
- I can't take my feet out.

1779
00:58:30,330 --> 00:58:31,580
(Mijoo adjusts quickly.)

1780
00:58:31,580 --> 00:58:33,220
It's like the mudflat.

1781
00:58:33,700 --> 00:58:34,950
There you go.

1782
00:58:35,890 --> 00:58:38,720
- 1, 2, 1, 2.
- Keep moving. Don't rest.

1783
00:58:38,720 --> 00:58:40,540
(As soon as they stop,
starch pulls their feet.)

1784
00:58:40,540 --> 00:58:41,930
Don't rest.

1785
00:58:42,100 --> 00:58:43,810
We will start right away
when you stop moving.

1786
00:58:45,100 --> 00:58:46,140
Get ready.

1787
00:58:46,140 --> 00:58:48,010
(Haha and Mijoo
versus Suk Jin and Ji Hyo)

1788
00:58:48,010 --> 00:58:50,950
- 1, 2, 1, 2.
- 1, 2, 1, 2.

1789
00:58:50,950 --> 00:58:54,010
(You win by having more balls
in your basket after 100 seconds.)

1790
00:58:54,310 --> 00:58:56,220
- 1, 2, 1, 2.
- 1, 2, 1, 2.

1791
00:58:56,220 --> 00:58:57,410
Grab a lot of balls.

1792
00:58:58,410 --> 00:58:59,950
Let's go. Let's go.

1793
00:58:59,950 --> 00:59:01,410
Are you okay?

1794
00:59:01,990 --> 00:59:03,430
- What is going on?
- What?

1795
00:59:03,430 --> 00:59:05,580
For goodness' sake! Haha!

1796
00:59:05,580 --> 00:59:08,160
(Their feet got stuck
because they stopped briefly.)

1797
00:59:08,160 --> 00:59:09,560
You can get up!

1798
00:59:10,560 --> 00:59:12,490
This is ridiculous.

1799
00:59:12,490 --> 00:59:13,870
- It's over for them!
- What are we going to do?

1800
00:59:13,870 --> 00:59:15,160
It's over for them!

1801
00:59:15,160 --> 00:59:16,700
- What are they going to do?
- Is it that bad?

1802
00:59:16,700 --> 00:59:18,810
- Is it that bad?
- They are done.

1803
00:59:18,810 --> 00:59:20,280
It looks that way.

1804
00:59:20,280 --> 00:59:22,450
(We should keep moving.)

1805
00:59:23,870 --> 00:59:25,100
Hold on.

1806
00:59:25,180 --> 00:59:27,010
- Is it that bad?
- Get going.

1807
00:59:28,280 --> 00:59:30,010
What is going on?

1808
00:59:30,490 --> 00:59:31,810
Suk Jin, give me a pull.

1809
00:59:31,810 --> 00:59:33,720
- I am stuck.
- 1, 2.

1810
00:59:33,720 --> 00:59:35,620
What a bunch of amateurs!

1811
00:59:35,620 --> 00:59:37,350
- 1, 2.
- Look at Haha.

1812
00:59:37,890 --> 00:59:40,700
Is it that bad? My goodness.

1813
00:59:40,700 --> 00:59:41,720
Is it that bad?

1814
00:59:41,720 --> 00:59:42,870
My goodness.

1815
00:59:44,970 --> 00:59:46,430
- Is it that bad?
- This is insane.

1816
00:59:47,100 --> 00:59:48,990
Let's take more balls.

1817
00:59:49,600 --> 00:59:51,640
- Come on.
- Where are you going?

1818
00:59:51,640 --> 00:59:53,870
It will be over if you fail
to put those balls in the basket.

1819
00:59:54,200 --> 00:59:56,970
- Good luck.
- This is hard.

1820
00:59:56,970 --> 00:59:58,780
(During the struggle,)

1821
00:59:58,780 --> 01:00:01,470
(an armed conflict occurs.)

1822
01:00:02,490 --> 01:00:03,950
How could you slap me?

1823
01:00:04,310 --> 01:00:06,180
Don't hit me!

1824
01:00:06,890 --> 01:00:09,680
They are the absolute worst.

1825
01:00:10,120 --> 01:00:12,030
Let's keep going.

1826
01:00:12,030 --> 01:00:13,950
- Ji Hyo is winning.
- Let's go.

1827
01:00:14,260 --> 01:00:15,890
- 1, 2.
- My goodness.

1828
01:00:15,890 --> 01:00:16,930
One.

1829
01:00:16,930 --> 01:00:18,160
(Which team put more balls
in the basket?)

1830
01:00:18,490 --> 01:00:19,490
(100 seconds are up.)

1831
01:00:19,490 --> 01:00:21,430
- This basket has more balls.
- Please come on out.

1832
01:00:21,430 --> 01:00:23,370
- Seriously.
- Gosh, how tiring.

1833
01:00:23,370 --> 01:00:25,010
- I am exhausted.
- Really?

1834
01:00:25,010 --> 01:00:26,830
- Seriously.
- Is it that bad?

1835
01:00:26,830 --> 01:00:27,910
I really can't move.

1836
01:00:27,910 --> 01:00:28,910
This team has nine balls.

1837
01:00:28,910 --> 01:00:29,950
This team has five balls.

1838
01:00:29,950 --> 01:00:30,950
Five balls.

1839
01:00:30,950 --> 01:00:33,080
Suk Jin's team will move on
to the next round.

1840
01:00:33,080 --> 01:00:34,120
Okay.

1841
01:00:34,850 --> 01:00:35,890
All right.

1842
01:00:36,810 --> 01:00:39,620
(So Min and Dong Jun
versus Jong Kook and Soyou)

1843
01:00:39,620 --> 01:00:42,060
My feet keep sinking.

1844
01:00:42,220 --> 01:00:43,720
(So Min takes tiny steps.)

1845
01:00:43,720 --> 01:00:44,830
This is no joke.

1846
01:00:44,890 --> 01:00:47,890
Okay! Never stop moving, Dong Jun.

1847
01:00:47,890 --> 01:00:49,890
Keep moving all the time.

1848
01:00:49,990 --> 01:00:52,060
Unbelievable.
This feels like a penalty.

1849
01:00:52,060 --> 01:00:53,660
- Look at how she walks.
- What?

1850
01:00:53,660 --> 01:00:55,390
Se Chan, can you keep
my glasses for me?

1851
01:00:55,540 --> 01:00:56,970
Jong Kook, it's not that hard.

1852
01:00:56,970 --> 01:00:58,560
- Look at how she walks.
- What?

1853
01:00:58,700 --> 01:00:59,930
(The two trainers
have adjusted perfectly.)

1854
01:00:59,930 --> 01:01:01,640
- Soyou, what's going on?
- Me too.

1855
01:01:01,640 --> 01:01:03,010
- You can walk like that?
- Really?

1856
01:01:03,450 --> 01:01:05,080
Oh, your feet keep sinking.

1857
01:01:05,080 --> 01:01:06,120
What's going on?

1858
01:01:06,510 --> 01:01:07,810
- Those two...
- Jong Kook.

1859
01:01:07,810 --> 01:01:09,620
- It's different from walking alone.
- Their strength is speed.

1860
01:01:09,620 --> 01:01:11,120
- Speed rather than energy.
- Our strength is speed.

1861
01:01:11,120 --> 01:01:12,990
Dong Jun is competitive too.

1862
01:01:12,990 --> 01:01:14,890
- Right.
- He's good.

1863
01:01:14,890 --> 01:01:16,580
- He's very fast too.
- He's very athletic.

1864
01:01:16,580 --> 01:01:18,450
- He's not an easy opponent.
- I feel bad...

1865
01:01:18,450 --> 01:01:19,830
that I'm his partner.

1866
01:01:19,830 --> 01:01:22,060
- No. I'm happy.
- I feel so bad.

1867
01:01:22,600 --> 01:01:25,200
You've never apologized to me once.

1868
01:01:26,490 --> 01:01:27,870
I'm already tired.

1869
01:01:27,870 --> 01:01:29,910
It's nothing once you get out.

1870
01:01:29,910 --> 01:01:31,060
Exactly.

1871
01:01:31,060 --> 01:01:33,180
He's so sweet.
After saying something,

1872
01:01:33,180 --> 01:01:35,410
- he gazes at the person.
- Right.

1873
01:01:35,680 --> 01:01:36,850
"I didn't do it."

1874
01:01:36,850 --> 01:01:38,100
(He copies Dong Jun.)

1875
01:01:38,100 --> 01:01:39,140
Right?

1876
01:01:39,140 --> 01:01:41,280
Dong Jun says something
and gazes at the person.

1877
01:01:41,280 --> 01:01:42,510
I learned something today.

1878
01:01:42,510 --> 01:01:44,240
That's what I learned as a kid.

1879
01:01:44,240 --> 01:01:45,620
I was told to look the person
in the eye.

1880
01:01:45,620 --> 01:01:48,060
That's why I feel so shy.
He keeps looking me in the eye.

1881
01:01:48,060 --> 01:01:49,120
- Seriously.
- I should do it too.

1882
01:01:49,120 --> 01:01:52,120
I think this couple is
too unrealistic,

1883
01:01:52,600 --> 01:01:54,200
but I really hope
those two will become a couple.

1884
01:01:55,120 --> 01:01:56,490
- For real?
- Yes, for real.

1885
01:01:56,490 --> 01:01:57,530
What about us?

1886
01:01:58,060 --> 01:02:00,290
All four of you, please stand up.

1887
01:02:00,290 --> 01:02:01,290
- Three.
- This is so uncomfortable.

1888
01:02:01,290 --> 01:02:02,330
- Two.
- This is...

1889
01:02:02,330 --> 01:02:03,430
- It must be hard.
- One.

1890
01:02:04,760 --> 01:02:06,540
- Are you ready?
- It's exhausting.

1891
01:02:06,540 --> 01:02:07,870
- 1, 2, 1, 2...
- My legs feel weak.

1892
01:02:07,870 --> 01:02:10,140
- They're good.
- We don't know who will win yet.

1893
01:02:10,140 --> 01:02:11,910
- We don't know who will win yet.
- Look at that.

1894
01:02:11,910 --> 01:02:12,970
- We don't know yet.
- They're neck-and-neck.

1895
01:02:12,970 --> 01:02:14,910
- They're both good.
- Both teams are good.

1896
01:02:15,180 --> 01:02:16,950
- What are they doing?
- What?

1897
01:02:16,950 --> 01:02:18,120
- What's going on?
- They're throwing all the balls?

1898
01:02:18,120 --> 01:02:19,290
- Is it okay?
- It's okay to remove all the balls.

1899
01:02:19,290 --> 01:02:21,850
But you can only throw them
from the middle.

1900
01:02:21,850 --> 01:02:23,350
That doesn't seem so smart.

1901
01:02:23,350 --> 01:02:24,620
You can pick them up on your way.

1902
01:02:24,620 --> 01:02:25,850
- That's not a good strategy.
- Hang in there.

1903
01:02:26,620 --> 01:02:28,830
- Oh, my.
- That's not a good strategy.

1904
01:02:28,830 --> 01:02:30,100
It takes too long.

1905
01:02:30,100 --> 01:02:31,120
We can do this.

1906
01:02:31,120 --> 01:02:33,100
- Pick these up.
- They can't pick them up.

1907
01:02:33,330 --> 01:02:34,930
- 1, 2...
- Oh, my.

1908
01:02:34,930 --> 01:02:36,200
(Now it's a head-on competition.)

1909
01:02:36,200 --> 01:02:37,740
(The gym master...)

1910
01:02:37,740 --> 01:02:39,580
(and the rising star
go head-to-head.)

1911
01:02:39,580 --> 01:02:40,830
- Dong Jun, you're doing great.
- Dong Jun!

1912
01:02:40,830 --> 01:02:42,080
- Oh, no!
- Oh, my.

1913
01:02:43,010 --> 01:02:44,470
(Jong Kook grabs Dong Jun.)

1914
01:02:44,470 --> 01:02:46,120
- My goodness.
- No!

1915
01:02:46,120 --> 01:02:47,410
Oh, my.

1916
01:02:48,240 --> 01:02:49,890
- It's over now.
- Oh, no.

1917
01:02:49,890 --> 01:02:52,240
That's it. Goodbye!

1918
01:02:52,240 --> 01:02:53,810
Goodbye!

1919
01:02:53,810 --> 01:02:55,160
Dong Jun, good job!

1920
01:02:55,160 --> 01:02:56,530
Good job.

1921
01:02:56,930 --> 01:02:58,580
So Min, aren't you tired?

1922
01:02:58,580 --> 01:03:00,930
- Be careful.
- Okay.

1923
01:03:01,290 --> 01:03:02,560
- Oh, my.
- Oh, my.

1924
01:03:02,560 --> 01:03:03,830
(Speed can't beat energy.)

1925
01:03:03,830 --> 01:03:04,870
Is it over?

1926
01:03:04,870 --> 01:03:06,640
- Stay calm.
- You can do this!

1927
01:03:06,640 --> 01:03:08,330
It feels like I'm hugging
a telephone pole.

1928
01:03:08,330 --> 01:03:09,410
Jong Kook!

1929
01:03:09,540 --> 01:03:11,430
Hold on. Hey.

1930
01:03:11,430 --> 01:03:13,180
So Min is grabbing Jong Kook's neck.

1931
01:03:13,180 --> 01:03:15,100
(So Min counterattacks
by grabbing Jong Kook's neck.)

1932
01:03:15,100 --> 01:03:16,700
So Min is grabbing Jong Kook's neck.

1933
01:03:16,700 --> 01:03:18,180
- We don't know yet.
- So Min.

1934
01:03:18,180 --> 01:03:19,850
So Min, we don't know yet.

1935
01:03:19,850 --> 01:03:21,870
- Oh, my!
- This is getting so messy!

1936
01:03:21,870 --> 01:03:23,740
So Min looks like squid in batter.

1937
01:03:24,140 --> 01:03:25,290
It looks so messy.

1938
01:03:25,290 --> 01:03:26,850
(The squid counterattacks.)

1939
01:03:26,850 --> 01:03:28,010
Oh, my.

1940
01:03:28,010 --> 01:03:29,530
- My goodness.
- So Min, what are you doing?

1941
01:03:29,760 --> 01:03:30,830
So Min!

1942
01:03:30,830 --> 01:03:32,220
Is this the UFC?

1943
01:03:32,220 --> 01:03:34,290
- You're all covered in batter!
- Is this the UFC?

1944
01:03:34,790 --> 01:03:36,160
- Why are you dipping her in there?
- So Min...

1945
01:03:36,160 --> 01:03:37,600
- Is this how you play this game?
- She's blowing air into my ears.

1946
01:03:37,600 --> 01:03:39,390
Your hair...

1947
01:03:39,390 --> 01:03:41,640
- Do something about your hair!
- Dong Jun...

1948
01:03:41,640 --> 01:03:44,200
Soyou's hair looks like
deep-fried seaweed rolls.

1949
01:03:44,200 --> 01:03:46,080
- Soyou...
- Gosh.

1950
01:03:46,280 --> 01:03:48,010
(Deep-fried seaweed rolls and squid)

1951
01:03:48,010 --> 01:03:49,040
Oh, my.

1952
01:03:49,540 --> 01:03:50,700
(Time is up.)

1953
01:03:50,700 --> 01:03:52,350
- Let's do this.
- Unbelievable.

1954
01:03:52,350 --> 01:03:54,870
- Gosh.
- Are you okay?

1955
01:03:54,870 --> 01:03:56,580
Does it have to be this fierce?

1956
01:03:57,010 --> 01:03:58,240
- They have 17 balls.
- 17.

1957
01:03:58,240 --> 01:03:59,720
- What about the other team?
- They have seven.

1958
01:03:59,720 --> 01:04:00,720
Seven.

1959
01:04:00,720 --> 01:04:02,010
Jong Kook and Soyou win.

1960
01:04:02,010 --> 01:04:03,490
- Are you okay?
- Oh, my.

1961
01:04:04,430 --> 01:04:06,850
- Does my hair look okay?
- What is she going to do?

1962
01:04:07,260 --> 01:04:09,760
- It looks like a seaweed roll.
- It's covered in batter.

1963
01:04:09,760 --> 01:04:11,120
- What is this?
- Oh, my.

1964
01:04:11,120 --> 01:04:12,290
What is she going to do?

1965
01:04:12,290 --> 01:04:13,600
Soyou, will you be okay?

1966
01:04:13,600 --> 01:04:15,040
There's nothing I can do.

1967
01:04:15,330 --> 01:04:16,700
Oh, my cap is attached to my hair!

1968
01:04:16,700 --> 01:04:18,160
No. Your cap is over here.

1969
01:04:18,430 --> 01:04:19,870
That's not your cap.

1970
01:04:19,870 --> 01:04:22,680
No. Your cap is over here.
That's not your cap.

1971
01:04:23,080 --> 01:04:24,240
- That's not your cap.
- That's your hair.

1972
01:04:24,240 --> 01:04:25,350
- That's your hair.
- That's not your cap.

1973
01:04:25,350 --> 01:04:26,950
Don't try to take it off.

1974
01:04:26,950 --> 01:04:28,140
What is this then?

1975
01:04:28,140 --> 01:04:30,950
Soyou, your cap is here! Your cap...

1976
01:04:30,950 --> 01:04:32,140
Your cap is here.

1977
01:04:32,140 --> 01:04:34,580
(So Min digs up something
that's supposed to be Soyou's cap.)

1978
01:04:34,580 --> 01:04:36,390
Will you be able to use it again?

1979
01:04:37,930 --> 01:04:39,430
You can untie it. Give me a second.

1980
01:04:39,430 --> 01:04:41,160
- Do you want to wash your feet?
- This cap has been sponsored.

1981
01:04:41,160 --> 01:04:43,290
- It's a seaweed roll cap.
- Is that a cap?

1982
01:04:43,790 --> 01:04:46,290
Next up are
Team Suk Jin and Team Jong Kook.

1983
01:04:46,290 --> 01:04:48,870
(Suk Jin and Ji Hyo
versus Jong Kook and Soyou)

1984
01:04:49,040 --> 01:04:50,760
This round will be...

1985
01:04:51,700 --> 01:04:53,870
really messy.

1986
01:04:54,430 --> 01:04:55,540
I'm scared.

1987
01:04:55,810 --> 01:04:58,780
Team Suk Jin, if you make it
to the finals,

1988
01:04:58,780 --> 01:05:00,220
you can end up at the top.

1989
01:05:00,220 --> 01:05:01,370
- Right?
- If we make it to the finals?

1990
01:05:01,370 --> 01:05:02,950
Bo Pil, you're so mean.

1991
01:05:02,950 --> 01:05:04,910
- We don't know yet.
- We don't know yet.

1992
01:05:05,410 --> 01:05:07,390
Suk Jin, we don't know yet.

1993
01:05:07,390 --> 01:05:09,060
- We don't know if they win.
- Jong Kook, don't feel sorry.

1994
01:05:09,060 --> 01:05:11,330
- We don't know what will happen.
- Please.

1995
01:05:11,330 --> 01:05:13,160
Who knows if he'll get stuck
in the starch?

1996
01:05:13,160 --> 01:05:14,720
Everyone...

1997
01:05:14,720 --> 01:05:15,830
Our strategy is...

1998
01:05:17,030 --> 01:05:18,720
Suk Jin is coming up
with a strategy.

1999
01:05:18,720 --> 01:05:19,790
A strategy?

2000
01:05:19,790 --> 01:05:21,600
- From here...
- I wonder what his strategy is.

2001
01:05:21,600 --> 01:05:22,970
I can't wait.

2002
01:05:22,970 --> 01:05:24,930
Do you know Mike Tyson's
famous quote?

2003
01:05:24,930 --> 01:05:26,810
"Everybody has a plan until
they get punched in the mouth."

2004
01:05:26,810 --> 01:05:30,140
(Everybody has a plan until
they get punched in the mouth.)

2005
01:05:30,140 --> 01:05:31,540
Everybody has a plan.

2006
01:05:31,540 --> 01:05:32,810
Until they get punched?

2007
01:05:32,810 --> 01:05:34,410
Hey, don't say that.

2008
01:05:34,410 --> 01:05:36,390
Is Suk Jin finally
getting punched today?

2009
01:05:38,680 --> 01:05:40,310
It's about time.

2010
01:05:41,260 --> 01:05:42,660
He should be brought to his senses.

2011
01:05:42,660 --> 01:05:45,060
- There is a good reason too.
- Of course. It's a game.

2012
01:05:45,430 --> 01:05:48,850
I'll keep what you said
deep inside my left chest.

2013
01:05:49,530 --> 01:05:51,790
Okay? Please understand
if I get aggressive.

2014
01:05:51,790 --> 01:05:52,870
Sure.

2015
01:05:53,700 --> 01:05:56,240
3, 2, 1.

2016
01:05:56,930 --> 01:05:58,640
Keep taking steps.

2017
01:05:58,640 --> 01:06:01,180
Gosh, why are they so fast?

2018
01:06:02,410 --> 01:06:04,350
They have surprisingly
good teamwork.

2019
01:06:04,350 --> 01:06:05,680
- I'm their fan.
- They're good at the game too.

2020
01:06:05,680 --> 01:06:07,040
- I'm a fan.
- Oh, my.

2021
01:06:07,040 --> 01:06:09,240
We don't know
which strategy works better.

2022
01:06:09,240 --> 01:06:10,240
- Right.
- Not yet.

2023
01:06:10,240 --> 01:06:12,120
- Oh, my.
- It's not easy.

2024
01:06:12,120 --> 01:06:13,180
- I'll focus.
- No.

2025
01:06:13,180 --> 01:06:14,310
- The balls are stuck.
- They're stuck.

2026
01:06:14,310 --> 01:06:15,950
Jong Kook's strategy works better.

2027
01:06:15,950 --> 01:06:17,850
Right. We should do that too.

2028
01:06:17,850 --> 01:06:19,350
They make it look so easy.

2029
01:06:19,350 --> 01:06:21,620
- I think it's over.
- This won't work. Give up.

2030
01:06:23,260 --> 01:06:25,990
- The balls are stuck.
- It's harder than it looks.

2031
01:06:26,560 --> 01:06:27,790
In the beginning...

2032
01:06:28,060 --> 01:06:29,330
They're guarding their balls.
The gate is locked now.

2033
01:06:29,330 --> 01:06:31,040
- It's locked.
- It's locked.

2034
01:06:31,660 --> 01:06:33,830
(Locked)

2035
01:06:34,740 --> 01:06:36,200
(It's locked?)

2036
01:06:36,200 --> 01:06:37,200
It's locked.

2037
01:06:37,200 --> 01:06:39,510
- Unbelievable.
- Suk Jin is going to get punched.

2038
01:06:39,510 --> 01:06:41,870
(A shield that no spear can pierce)

2039
01:06:42,850 --> 01:06:45,620
(A dull spear
that can't even pierce tofu)

2040
01:06:45,620 --> 01:06:47,580
- Here we go!
- He's going to get punched!

2041
01:06:48,290 --> 01:06:50,950
- Suk Jin-Punching Show.
- He's going to get punched.

2042
01:06:51,120 --> 01:06:52,490
- Has it started?
- All right.

2043
01:06:52,490 --> 01:06:54,390
Suk Jin, it's time to...

2044
01:06:54,390 --> 01:06:56,720
Suk Jin, it's time to
carry out your strategy now!

2045
01:06:56,720 --> 01:06:58,220
But since there's Ji Hyo...

2046
01:06:58,220 --> 01:07:00,240
- You'll turn into a plaster figure.
- Ji Hyo, don't be so weak.

2047
01:07:00,240 --> 01:07:01,640
Don't be so weak!

2048
01:07:01,870 --> 01:07:03,240
What's with you?

2049
01:07:03,240 --> 01:07:05,930
- You should thank Ji Hyo.
- What are you doing?

2050
01:07:06,370 --> 01:07:08,100
What are you doing?

2051
01:07:08,100 --> 01:07:09,410
Come on.
We should at least give it a try.

2052
01:07:09,410 --> 01:07:10,850
Here we go.

2053
01:07:11,240 --> 01:07:13,350
- Hold on. 1, 2, 1, 2.
- Gosh.

2054
01:07:13,350 --> 01:07:15,640
(The dull spear
and the muscular shield...)

2055
01:07:15,640 --> 01:07:17,950
(go head-to-head.)

2056
01:07:19,540 --> 01:07:20,580
Here we go.

2057
01:07:20,580 --> 01:07:21,680
(As soon as they start...)

2058
01:07:21,680 --> 01:07:23,080
- Oh, my.
- Here we go.

2059
01:07:23,080 --> 01:07:25,060
- Unbelievable.
- Is this professional wrestling?

2060
01:07:25,760 --> 01:07:26,950
Left, right.

2061
01:07:27,260 --> 01:07:28,950
Why did he have to compete
with Jong Kook?

2062
01:07:28,950 --> 01:07:30,290
- Oh, my.
- Jong Kook...

2063
01:07:30,930 --> 01:07:32,290
- Jong Kook...
- Oh, no.

2064
01:07:32,290 --> 01:07:34,290
- He's being covered in batter.
- No!

2065
01:07:34,290 --> 01:07:36,370
- He's dipped in the batter.
- Oh, my.

2066
01:07:36,640 --> 01:07:38,260
He's being covered in batter.

2067
01:07:38,260 --> 01:07:39,330
(Flavorful)

2068
01:07:39,870 --> 01:07:41,040
- Please.
- Ji Hyo, stand up!

2069
01:07:41,040 --> 01:07:43,100
Stand up!

2070
01:07:43,100 --> 01:07:44,140
Stop!

2071
01:07:44,470 --> 01:07:46,310
(A starch man is born.)

2072
01:07:46,310 --> 01:07:47,410
Stand up!

2073
01:07:47,410 --> 01:07:49,450
Ji Hyo, stand up!

2074
01:07:49,450 --> 01:07:51,790
Stop! Stand up!

2075
01:07:51,790 --> 01:07:53,490
- Stop!
- Stop!

2076
01:07:53,490 --> 01:07:55,010
Hey, stand up!

2077
01:07:55,010 --> 01:07:57,180
- Stop!
- This is too sad.

2078
01:07:57,180 --> 01:07:58,720
- Stand up!
- This is sad.

2079
01:07:58,720 --> 01:07:59,950
Hold on. Give me a second.

2080
01:07:59,950 --> 01:08:02,350
- Hurry up and stand up!
- This is too sad.

2081
01:08:03,060 --> 01:08:04,870
(He got covered in batter without
a chance to show off his strength.)

2082
01:08:04,870 --> 01:08:06,120
- Stand up!
- This is too sad.

2083
01:08:06,120 --> 01:08:07,930
Hold on. Give me a second.

2084
01:08:07,930 --> 01:08:10,060
- Hurry up and stand up!
- Spare them!

2085
01:08:10,830 --> 01:08:12,330
Are you okay?

2086
01:08:12,640 --> 01:08:13,970
Gosh, I can't believe you.

2087
01:08:14,410 --> 01:08:15,780
Are you okay?

2088
01:08:15,780 --> 01:08:17,240
(Ji Hyo is angry
at her incompetent partner.)

2089
01:08:17,240 --> 01:08:18,510
- Why are you doing this?
- I can't believe you.

2090
01:08:18,510 --> 01:08:19,970
Why are you doing this?

2091
01:08:19,970 --> 01:08:22,120
(The starch-covered fighter)

2092
01:08:22,120 --> 01:08:23,720
I'm fighting against our opponent!

2093
01:08:25,450 --> 01:08:27,490
You should stop Suk Jin!

2094
01:08:27,910 --> 01:08:31,350
Suk Jin, don't give up!

2095
01:08:31,350 --> 01:08:32,850
- Here we go again.
- Here we go again.

2096
01:08:32,850 --> 01:08:34,390
- Oh, my.
- Are they okay?

2097
01:08:34,960 --> 01:08:38,700
This will happen to
whoever makes it to the finals.

2098
01:08:39,590 --> 01:08:41,460
(Making everyone scared
of the finals, the game is over.)

2099
01:08:41,460 --> 01:08:42,670
- What?
- Suk Jin, are those your tears?

2100
01:08:42,670 --> 01:08:44,870
- Suk Jin is crying!
- Are those your tears?

2101
01:08:44,870 --> 01:08:46,580
Suk Jin!

2102
01:08:46,580 --> 01:08:48,710
- Is he crying? Are they tears?
- He's crying.

2103
01:08:48,710 --> 01:08:50,000
He's crying.

2104
01:08:50,600 --> 01:08:51,670
Here we go.

2105
01:08:51,670 --> 01:08:53,510
(The monstrous team
helps Ji Hyo and Suk Jin up.)

2106
01:08:53,510 --> 01:08:55,050
- Stand up.
- Okay.

2107
01:08:55,050 --> 01:08:56,840
You're amazing.

2108
01:08:57,640 --> 01:08:58,790
You fought so well.

2109
01:08:58,790 --> 01:09:00,420
Your strategy worked.

2110
01:09:00,420 --> 01:09:01,590
(Jong Kook and So You: 17,
Suk Jin and Ji Hyo: 9)

2111
01:09:01,590 --> 01:09:03,220
I'm impressed.

2112
01:09:04,050 --> 01:09:05,420
You weren't embarrassing.

2113
01:09:05,420 --> 01:09:07,300
- Seriously.
- You fought well.

2114
01:09:07,300 --> 01:09:09,200
- I admit it.
- You lost, but you fought well.

2115
01:09:09,350 --> 01:09:11,200
Guys, Jong Kook...

2116
01:09:11,200 --> 01:09:12,500
(Jong Kook...)

2117
01:09:12,500 --> 01:09:14,130
is impossible to beat. Just give up.

2118
01:09:14,560 --> 01:09:15,590
Suk Jin.

2119
01:09:15,590 --> 01:09:17,370
(Jae Suk and Yuqi compete
with Se Chan and Doyeon.)

2120
01:09:18,260 --> 01:09:19,710
(Jong Kook and Soyou)

2121
01:09:19,710 --> 01:09:21,580
(Jae Suk and Yuqi)

2122
01:09:21,580 --> 01:09:23,380
This round is going to be
interesting.

2123
01:09:23,380 --> 01:09:24,880
- I can't wait. It's a big match.
- This is going to be fun.

2124
01:09:24,880 --> 01:09:27,810
- It's going to be a dog fight.
- Yuqi...

2125
01:09:27,950 --> 01:09:29,620
- Let me tell you.
- Get in here.

2126
01:09:29,620 --> 01:09:31,590
I'll do my best,
but I won't go to the finals.

2127
01:09:31,590 --> 01:09:32,810
It's going to be so fun.

2128
01:09:33,180 --> 01:09:34,880
He'll do his best, but he won't...

2129
01:09:34,880 --> 01:09:36,380
- I won't go to the finals.
- He gives up.

2130
01:09:36,380 --> 01:09:38,030
- Do you understand?
- I think I do.

2131
01:09:38,030 --> 01:09:39,220
Soyou, do we go first?

2132
01:09:40,350 --> 01:09:41,890
It's starch
that's flowing down my face.

2133
01:09:42,460 --> 01:09:44,420
- So this is how it feels.
- It's going to be interesting.

2134
01:09:44,420 --> 01:09:45,800
I can't wait. It's a big match.

2135
01:09:46,130 --> 01:09:48,540
- You win by losing.
- It's going to be a dog fight.

2136
01:09:49,370 --> 01:09:51,130
It's going to be interesting.

2137
01:09:51,130 --> 01:09:52,560
I can't wait. It's a big match.

2138
01:09:52,560 --> 01:09:54,670
It's going to be a dog fight.

2139
01:09:55,000 --> 01:09:56,450
3, 2, 1.

2140
01:09:56,750 --> 01:09:58,140
- Let's go!
- 1, 2...

2141
01:09:58,140 --> 01:10:01,050
- 1, 2, 1, 2...
- 1, 2, 1, 2...

2142
01:10:01,050 --> 01:10:03,490
- 1, 2, 1, 2...
- How can you grab us already?

2143
01:10:03,490 --> 01:10:05,290
Already?

2144
01:10:05,290 --> 01:10:06,660
- If you fall, it's over.
- Let's wait just a minute.

2145
01:10:06,660 --> 01:10:07,850
- Just a minute.
- If you fall, it's over.

2146
01:10:07,850 --> 01:10:09,660
- Let's wait just a minute.
- If you fall, it's over.

2147
01:10:09,660 --> 01:10:11,420
- Just a minute.
- Oh, my.

2148
01:10:11,420 --> 01:10:12,420
(Screaming)

2149
01:10:12,420 --> 01:10:13,800
(Jae Suk attacks first
using his teeth.)

2150
01:10:13,800 --> 01:10:15,550
- I didn't know...
- You better fall!

2151
01:10:16,220 --> 01:10:18,890
Let's go. 1, 2, 1, 2...

2152
01:10:18,890 --> 01:10:20,670
1, 2, 1, 2...

2153
01:10:20,670 --> 01:10:23,060
He kicked for real.

2154
01:10:23,060 --> 01:10:25,130
- He does that.
- He kicked for real.

2155
01:10:25,130 --> 01:10:26,580
They're taking all the balls.

2156
01:10:26,580 --> 01:10:28,130
- How...
- 1, 2, 1, 2...

2157
01:10:28,130 --> 01:10:29,340
- Slowly. 1, 2, 1, 2...
- 1, 2, 1, 2...

2158
01:10:29,340 --> 01:10:31,210
- Wait!
- 1, 2, 1, 2...

2159
01:10:31,210 --> 01:10:33,250
- His legs are so long.
- His legs are so long.

2160
01:10:33,250 --> 01:10:34,640
His legs are long, so he's fast.

2161
01:10:34,640 --> 01:10:35,750
No!

2162
01:10:35,750 --> 01:10:36,790
(Usain Bolt running across
a pool of starch)

2163
01:10:36,790 --> 01:10:39,090
Please don't grab us.

2164
01:10:39,420 --> 01:10:40,850
Don't grab us!

2165
01:10:41,590 --> 01:10:43,380
(Yuqi squeezes in.)

2166
01:10:43,380 --> 01:10:45,350
- Yuqi is unbelievable too.
- Don't do this.

2167
01:10:45,350 --> 01:10:46,530
Don't do this.

2168
01:10:46,720 --> 01:10:47,830
Yuqi.

2169
01:10:47,830 --> 01:10:50,560
(While Yuqi blocks
Kwang Soo and Won Young...)

2170
01:10:50,560 --> 01:10:52,260
Kwang Soo's strategy...

2171
01:10:53,800 --> 01:10:56,500
(This time, Kwang Soo bites him.)

2172
01:10:57,340 --> 01:10:58,370
Did you hear that?

2173
01:10:58,370 --> 01:10:59,430
(Kwang Soo, a young man with strong
teeth, who's best at cheating.)

2174
01:10:59,430 --> 01:11:03,080
The prize money isn't worth
doing this over.

2175
01:11:03,080 --> 01:11:04,100
(Screaming)

2176
01:11:04,100 --> 01:11:05,250
(What's this noise?)

2177
01:11:06,550 --> 01:11:08,810
(He retaliates
with his front teeth.)

2178
01:11:09,450 --> 01:11:11,490
Do they have to go this far?

2179
01:11:12,050 --> 01:11:14,090
Don't do this.

2180
01:11:14,090 --> 01:11:15,490
What are you talking about?

2181
01:11:15,790 --> 01:11:17,290
- Where are you going?
- It will end like this then.

2182
01:11:17,290 --> 01:11:18,790
- It will end like this.
- It will end like this.

2183
01:11:18,790 --> 01:11:20,030
(Team Jae Suk will win if they get
rid of Team Kwang Soo's balls.)

2184
01:11:20,030 --> 01:11:21,090
It's over.

2185
01:11:21,090 --> 01:11:22,960
It looks like Team Jae Suk is
going to go to the finals.

2186
01:11:22,960 --> 01:11:24,060
Hey, Jae Suk.

2187
01:11:24,060 --> 01:11:27,500
If you do that,
you'll end up going to the finals.

2188
01:11:27,500 --> 01:11:28,590
Won Young. Grab him.

2189
01:11:28,740 --> 01:11:30,670
Yuqi, we can't go to the finals.

2190
01:11:30,670 --> 01:11:31,960
Hold on.

2191
01:11:31,960 --> 01:11:33,040
- Hold on.
- Yuqi.

2192
01:11:33,380 --> 01:11:34,880
You'll be in trouble
if you go up to the finals.

2193
01:11:35,100 --> 01:11:36,600
There's 1, 2.

2194
01:11:36,600 --> 01:11:37,600
We don't have to.

2195
01:11:37,600 --> 01:11:39,100
- Don't you have to take them out?
- Put it in their basket.

2196
01:11:39,100 --> 01:11:40,550
- In their basket?
- We can't go to the finals.

2197
01:11:40,810 --> 01:11:42,050
What is he saying?

2198
01:11:42,050 --> 01:11:43,450
He said they can't go to the finals.

2199
01:11:43,450 --> 01:11:45,140
Give it to me. I'll put them in.

2200
01:11:45,140 --> 01:11:46,420
He said they can't go to the finals.

2201
01:11:46,620 --> 01:11:48,380
We can't go to the finals.

2202
01:11:48,380 --> 01:11:50,380
If we go to the finals,
we're going to die.

2203
01:11:50,460 --> 01:11:51,790
Where are we supposed to put these?

2204
01:11:51,790 --> 01:11:52,790
Over there.

2205
01:11:53,530 --> 01:11:54,550
Wait, Kwang Soo.

2206
01:11:54,550 --> 01:11:55,920
I'm going to send them
to the finals.

2207
01:11:55,920 --> 01:11:57,260
(He blatantly puts all the balls
into Kwang Soo's side.)

2208
01:11:57,260 --> 01:11:58,830
Who knows? You could end up going.

2209
01:11:58,830 --> 01:12:01,340
(They're putting the balls
into one another's baskets.)

2210
01:12:01,340 --> 01:12:02,930
- This is hilarious.
- This is how it's going to be.

2211
01:12:02,930 --> 01:12:06,040
This is a game to avoid winning.

2212
01:12:06,040 --> 01:12:08,040
- You have to lose this game, right?
- Right.

2213
01:12:08,040 --> 01:12:09,040
(An unprecedented game to lose)

2214
01:12:09,300 --> 01:12:10,500
(Soaked)

2215
01:12:10,500 --> 01:12:11,970
- I know.
- I'm scared.

2216
01:12:11,970 --> 01:12:13,750
- We have to put it in.
- He looks so scary.

2217
01:12:14,420 --> 01:12:16,590
(The Starch Man thrashes about.)

2218
01:12:16,590 --> 01:12:17,880
Won Young is crying.

2219
01:12:17,880 --> 01:12:19,250
- Won Young is crying.
- He looks terrifying.

2220
01:12:19,620 --> 01:12:20,660
He looks so scary right now.

2221
01:12:20,660 --> 01:12:21,680
Where do we put the balls?

2222
01:12:21,680 --> 01:12:22,990
- My gosh.
- Over there.

2223
01:12:23,160 --> 01:12:24,330
Over there.

2224
01:12:25,030 --> 01:12:26,220
How many do we have?

2225
01:12:26,220 --> 01:12:27,250
(At this rate, Kwang Soo's team
will go to the finals.)

2226
01:12:27,250 --> 01:12:28,390
At this rate, Kwang Soo will win.

2227
01:12:28,390 --> 01:12:30,670
- Kwang Soo will win.
- We have a lot, but we must lose.

2228
01:12:30,670 --> 01:12:32,830
- Come here.
- We have a lot, but we must lose.

2229
01:12:32,830 --> 01:12:34,430
- 1.
- 1, 2.

2230
01:12:34,430 --> 01:12:36,540
Just put one in there
and take all of yours out.

2231
01:12:36,540 --> 01:12:38,040
(He suggests a strategy.)

2232
01:12:38,040 --> 01:12:39,130
You have 30 seconds left.

2233
01:12:39,240 --> 01:12:41,300
- Take it out.
- Take it out and go up.

2234
01:12:41,300 --> 01:12:43,040
- You look like a ghost.
- 1, 2.

2235
01:12:43,040 --> 01:12:44,280
One.

2236
01:12:44,280 --> 01:12:45,280
(Jae Suk and Yuqi are protecting
Kwang Soo's basket.)

2237
01:12:45,280 --> 01:12:48,080
Are they really playing to lose?

2238
01:12:48,080 --> 01:12:49,710
(If they empty Kwang Soo's basket,
Jae Suk's team will win.)

2239
01:12:49,950 --> 01:12:50,950
(This is the chance!)

2240
01:12:50,950 --> 01:12:52,050
Won Young, take them out!

2241
01:12:53,310 --> 01:12:56,510
It's nice that they're exhausted as
they're going up against us next.

2242
01:12:56,830 --> 01:12:58,330
- I'm exhausted.
- Don't take them out.

2243
01:12:58,330 --> 01:12:59,380
- No.
- Don't take them out.

2244
01:12:59,380 --> 01:13:01,390
It hurts.

2245
01:13:01,390 --> 01:13:02,420
Don't take them out.

2246
01:13:02,420 --> 01:13:04,200
(Who will win this desperate battle
to fail to move on to the finals?)

2247
01:13:04,200 --> 01:13:05,220
- It hurts.
- Don't take them out.

2248
01:13:05,220 --> 01:13:07,300
- Here. It hurts.
- 10 seconds left.

2249
01:13:07,300 --> 01:13:09,260
Gosh, I'm confused.
Who's going to win?

2250
01:13:09,260 --> 01:13:10,710
Won Young!

2251
01:13:10,710 --> 01:13:11,760
- I'm working on it.
- I'll put one in.

2252
01:13:11,760 --> 01:13:13,410
Jae Suk is likely to win.

2253
01:13:13,740 --> 01:13:15,630
- I took them all out.
- How many do we have?

2254
01:13:15,630 --> 01:13:18,710
(The whistle sounds, and
the last ball leaves Yuqi's hand.)

2255
01:13:18,710 --> 01:13:20,170
There were so many balls in there.

2256
01:13:20,170 --> 01:13:21,210
I took them all out.

2257
01:13:21,210 --> 01:13:22,420
- I took them all out.
- How many do we have?

2258
01:13:22,420 --> 01:13:23,510
- I took them all out.
- We have to have something.

2259
01:13:23,510 --> 01:13:24,750
Jae Suk wins!

2260
01:13:24,750 --> 01:13:26,660
- Yoo Jae Suk's team wins.
- Darn it!

2261
01:13:28,350 --> 01:13:29,510
Let's go right away.

2262
01:13:29,510 --> 01:13:30,790
(They tried so hard to lose.)

2263
01:13:30,790 --> 01:13:32,250
- Why?
- No.

2264
01:13:32,350 --> 01:13:34,130
Why are we going to the finals?

2265
01:13:35,530 --> 01:13:37,330
Okay. Let's continue.

2266
01:13:37,330 --> 01:13:38,560
You've won.

2267
01:13:38,560 --> 01:13:40,040
Okay. Congratulations.

2268
01:13:40,040 --> 01:13:41,240
- It was a dramatic win.
- I can't do this.

2269
01:13:41,460 --> 01:13:42,760
I couldn't even laugh.

2270
01:13:42,760 --> 01:13:43,840
Kwang Soo was too... Gosh.

2271
01:13:43,840 --> 01:13:45,600
- Did you fart?
- No, I didn't.

2272
01:13:46,100 --> 01:13:48,080
Did you just fart?

2273
01:13:48,210 --> 01:13:49,670
No, I didn't. I swear.

2274
01:13:49,670 --> 01:13:51,100
- Kwang Soo.
- It wasn't me.

2275
01:13:51,100 --> 01:13:52,670
- I heard it.
- I didn't fart.

2276
01:13:52,670 --> 01:13:54,250
Why would you fart?

2277
01:13:54,550 --> 01:13:56,510
It was my foot.

2278
01:13:56,510 --> 01:13:58,310
Why would you fart in front of
idol singers?

2279
01:13:58,310 --> 01:13:59,550
Does that make sense?

2280
01:13:59,550 --> 01:14:01,660
- Where did the towel on my head go?
- Why would you fart?

2281
01:14:01,660 --> 01:14:02,990
It's because he's no longer
under pressure.

2282
01:14:02,990 --> 01:14:05,290
Sometimes you fart after being
under pressure. It's okay.

2283
01:14:05,680 --> 01:14:07,920
- Hey.
- It's because your legs are weak.

2284
01:14:07,920 --> 01:14:09,700
- This...
- Since it turned out this way,

2285
01:14:09,700 --> 01:14:11,830
- Move after releasing your legs.
- Yuqi, let's win in the finals.

2286
01:14:11,830 --> 01:14:13,130
(Hitting)

2287
01:14:13,130 --> 01:14:15,630
I told you to release your legs
before you moved.

2288
01:14:15,630 --> 01:14:16,740
(There was a collision accident
because Kwang Soo's legs are weak.)

2289
01:14:17,430 --> 01:14:19,740
- Goodness.
- Jae Suk is going to sleep well.

2290
01:14:19,910 --> 01:14:21,170
My goodness.

2291
01:14:21,170 --> 01:14:23,410
(It was a messy win,
just like everyone expected.)

2292
01:14:23,410 --> 01:14:25,450
This is a complete mess.

2293
01:14:25,450 --> 01:14:28,170
(He has no strength
to control his body.)

2294
01:14:28,780 --> 01:14:30,750
I guess Kwang Soo really
used up all his energy.

2295
01:14:30,810 --> 01:14:32,050
Let's go up, Kwang Soo.

2296
01:14:32,050 --> 01:14:33,380
3. 1, 2, 3.

2297
01:14:33,380 --> 01:14:34,810
(They move Kwang Soo,
who has no energy.)

2298
01:14:34,810 --> 01:14:36,660
- Oh, no.
- Move your legs.

2299
01:14:38,960 --> 01:14:41,460
No. You should try to get up.
Don't just lie there.

2300
01:14:41,460 --> 01:14:42,460
What do I have to do?

2301
01:14:42,460 --> 01:14:43,460
Get up.

2302
01:14:43,460 --> 01:14:45,220
Kwang Soo, get up.

2303
01:14:45,220 --> 01:14:47,740
- That's not easy.
- 1, 2, 3.

2304
01:14:48,590 --> 01:14:49,590
His hair is going to get
ripped out.

2305
01:14:49,590 --> 01:14:51,840
Be careful. He got hair plugs
in the back of his head.

2306
01:14:52,210 --> 01:14:54,500
Don't you get hair plugs
in the front of your head?

2307
01:14:54,500 --> 01:14:55,840
Why would you get hair plugs
in the back?

2308
01:14:55,840 --> 01:14:58,080
He got some hair from the front
and implanted them in the back.

2309
01:14:58,080 --> 01:14:59,450
Why would he do that?

2310
01:14:59,450 --> 01:15:00,620
He wanted to look cool.

2311
01:15:01,250 --> 01:15:03,250
- He wanted to do that.
- Really?

2312
01:15:03,250 --> 01:15:04,640
He wanted to be hip.

2313
01:15:04,640 --> 01:15:05,640
(He's full of coolness and hair
in the back of his head.)

2314
01:15:05,640 --> 01:15:07,290
- Kwang Soo.
- You have no energy.

2315
01:15:08,210 --> 01:15:10,160
It was another dirty game today.

2316
01:15:11,880 --> 01:15:15,030
(An exhausted water strider)

2317
01:15:15,030 --> 01:15:16,630
- Stay still.
- Oh, my. Come here.

2318
01:15:16,630 --> 01:15:18,170
- Goodness.
- My pants.

2319
01:15:18,420 --> 01:15:20,340
I got your pants.

2320
01:15:20,340 --> 01:15:21,460
- She grabbed them.
- Hey.

2321
01:15:22,000 --> 01:15:23,260
I'm sorry, Won Young.

2322
01:15:23,560 --> 01:15:24,930
I'm sorry, Won Young!

2323
01:15:26,060 --> 01:15:28,740
This is a line guys always say.

2324
01:15:29,340 --> 01:15:31,210
They say "I'm sorry"
after they drink.

2325
01:15:31,210 --> 01:15:33,170
I'm sorry.

2326
01:15:33,170 --> 01:15:35,120
"I'm sorry."

2327
01:15:35,120 --> 01:15:36,750
- "I'm going to go."
- "I'm sorry I'm so pathetic."

2328
01:15:36,750 --> 01:15:37,920
Come get him.

2329
01:15:38,120 --> 01:15:39,290
Next time you're here,

2330
01:15:39,290 --> 01:15:40,920
- team up with Jong Kook.
- No, it's okay.

2331
01:15:40,920 --> 01:15:42,120
I'm sorry.

2332
01:15:43,530 --> 01:15:45,490
- Oh, my.
- He's insane.

2333
01:15:45,490 --> 01:15:46,530
(I want to be on your team
next time too.)

2334
01:15:47,420 --> 01:15:49,030
- I'm going.
- "I'm sorry I'm so pathetic."

2335
01:15:49,030 --> 01:15:51,220
Come and catch us if you can.

2336
01:15:51,220 --> 01:15:52,260
He looks like the ghost
in "Ju-on: The Grudge".

2337
01:15:52,260 --> 01:15:53,700
(As the ranks are changing...)

2338
01:15:53,700 --> 01:15:55,760
The results of this game
can change...

2339
01:15:55,760 --> 01:15:57,170
- the rankings significantly.
- Right.

2340
01:15:57,170 --> 01:15:59,210
We didn't put in a lot of balls
in the last round.

2341
01:15:59,300 --> 01:16:00,840
You have this round
to make up for it.

2342
01:16:01,580 --> 01:16:03,340
Do you think we stand a chance?

2343
01:16:05,580 --> 01:16:07,750
I'm just doing it because
I made it to the finals.

2344
01:16:09,210 --> 01:16:10,250
(This is so funny.)

2345
01:16:10,250 --> 01:16:11,490
My gosh, this is...

2346
01:16:11,490 --> 01:16:13,850
I didn't want to go up
into the final round.

2347
01:16:13,850 --> 01:16:16,880
I think I know what will happen.
I think I saw a preview of this.

2348
01:16:16,920 --> 01:16:18,530
I saw you getting stuck
in the starch.

2349
01:16:18,880 --> 01:16:21,200
3, 2, 1.

2350
01:16:21,200 --> 01:16:22,850
(The final round starts!)

2351
01:16:23,560 --> 01:16:25,000
They're off to a good start.

2352
01:16:25,000 --> 01:16:26,300
(The two teams cross the starch.
Who will win?)

2353
01:16:26,300 --> 01:16:27,930
Both teams are showing manners.

2354
01:16:28,590 --> 01:16:30,000
- They're throwing their balls out.
- They're emptying their baskets.

2355
01:16:30,000 --> 01:16:31,600
They're gathering them,
and they're throwing them out.

2356
01:16:31,600 --> 01:16:34,340
I don't think throwing them out
is a good strategy. We did that.

2357
01:16:34,340 --> 01:16:35,430
I think gathering is better too.

2358
01:16:35,430 --> 01:16:36,840
They're really good.

2359
01:16:36,840 --> 01:16:37,840
(They are picking up the balls
they threw out.)

2360
01:16:37,840 --> 01:16:39,640
(A sound of a fart)

2361
01:16:39,640 --> 01:16:41,580
(What?)

2362
01:16:41,580 --> 01:16:42,920
I didn't fart.

2363
01:16:42,920 --> 01:16:44,420
- Maybe Kwang Soo didn't fart.
- Hey.

2364
01:16:44,420 --> 01:16:45,420
- Yuqi.
- Was that fart?

2365
01:16:45,420 --> 01:16:47,810
I told you it wasn't me.
It came from Yuqi's direction.

2366
01:16:48,380 --> 01:16:50,720
- It really wasn't me.
- Yuqi.

2367
01:16:51,420 --> 01:16:52,960
- You must be healthy.
- It'll become the talk of the town.

2368
01:16:52,960 --> 01:16:54,000
(It's so much fun to tease her.)

2369
01:16:54,000 --> 01:16:55,390
But you shouldn't do this
to do that.

2370
01:16:55,390 --> 01:16:57,300
Yuqi's fart sounds healthy.

2371
01:16:57,300 --> 01:16:58,500
The sound is a bit...

2372
01:16:58,500 --> 01:17:00,870
- It was a healthy sound.
- This is better.

2373
01:17:00,870 --> 01:17:02,130
- They're neck and neck.
- Let's go.

2374
01:17:02,130 --> 01:17:03,340
- It's similar.
- I think Jae Suk...

2375
01:17:03,340 --> 01:17:04,800
I think Jae Suk's team is winning.

2376
01:17:04,800 --> 01:17:05,840
Who?

2377
01:17:05,840 --> 01:17:07,630
- Who's winning?
- Your team!

2378
01:17:07,630 --> 01:17:08,710
- We are?
- Yes.

2379
01:17:08,710 --> 01:17:10,280
Then we need to stick ourselves
into the starch.

2380
01:17:10,280 --> 01:17:11,380
What?

2381
01:17:11,380 --> 01:17:12,470
- Okay.
- Really?

2382
01:17:12,470 --> 01:17:13,840
They're going to do that?

2383
01:17:13,840 --> 01:17:15,810
- We're here.
- If you do that, you'll win.

2384
01:17:15,810 --> 01:17:17,090
- They're coming. Do it.
- They're coming.

2385
01:17:17,090 --> 01:17:18,140
- Do it!
- Here they come.

2386
01:17:18,140 --> 01:17:19,790
- Get yourselves in the starch.
- They're coming. Do it.

2387
01:17:19,790 --> 01:17:21,510
(We're going to open up
the locked door.)

2388
01:17:21,510 --> 01:17:23,310
- Lock yourselves in the starch!
- We have to get through.

2389
01:17:25,550 --> 01:17:27,720
The balls are coming out so quickly.

2390
01:17:27,720 --> 01:17:28,800
(They successfully take over
Jae Suk's basket upon arrival.)

2391
01:17:29,090 --> 01:17:31,260
This is the scene that I saw.

2392
01:17:31,460 --> 01:17:32,760
(This scene)

2393
01:17:32,760 --> 01:17:34,560
- Hey!
- It's over.

2394
01:17:34,560 --> 01:17:35,840
Is this how you're going to be?

2395
01:17:35,840 --> 01:17:36,910
He can't get up.

2396
01:17:36,910 --> 01:17:38,630
(He doesn't even get a chance
to pull Jong Kook in properly.)

2397
01:17:38,630 --> 01:17:40,040
He got sucked in.

2398
01:17:40,040 --> 01:17:41,430
(He ended up getting sucked in.)

2399
01:17:41,430 --> 01:17:43,280
- He got sucked in.
- Goodness.

2400
01:17:43,280 --> 01:17:44,840
- Oh, gosh!
- Goodness.

2401
01:17:45,050 --> 01:17:46,840
- He got sucked in. It's over.
- Goodness.

2402
01:17:46,840 --> 01:17:49,510
- I'm sorry.
- It's over.

2403
01:17:50,290 --> 01:17:51,680
Just end it!

2404
01:17:52,420 --> 01:17:53,810
Don't do that.

2405
01:17:53,810 --> 01:17:55,620
You dirty guy!

2406
01:17:56,290 --> 01:17:57,380
- Hey!
- Okay!

2407
01:17:57,550 --> 01:17:58,590
It's done!

2408
01:17:58,590 --> 01:18:00,420
(As his last-ditch effort, he puts
his aggressive teeth into play.)

2409
01:18:00,420 --> 01:18:01,750
Just end it quickly.

2410
01:18:01,750 --> 01:18:03,090
Jae Suk's biting.

2411
01:18:03,090 --> 01:18:04,530
Don't bite me.

2412
01:18:04,530 --> 01:18:06,830
(I'm going to leave a mark
on your chest muscles.)

2413
01:18:06,830 --> 01:18:08,630
He's still biting him.

2414
01:18:08,630 --> 01:18:10,000
(Even if they try to rip off
their name tags in vain,)

2415
01:18:10,000 --> 01:18:12,800
(the pendulum of victory
has already been tilted.)

2416
01:18:12,930 --> 01:18:14,710
We did it.

2417
01:18:15,100 --> 01:18:16,430
We did it.

2418
01:18:16,430 --> 01:18:17,450
I...

2419
01:18:17,450 --> 01:18:19,140
- This is like a penalty.
- Gosh.

2420
01:18:19,300 --> 01:18:20,580
Are you okay, Jae Suk?

2421
01:18:20,580 --> 01:18:22,470
- Are you okay?
- Goodness, Jae Suk.

2422
01:18:22,470 --> 01:18:24,290
Jae Suk is crying too.

2423
01:18:25,140 --> 01:18:26,710
- Oh, no.
- Jae Suk.

2424
01:18:26,710 --> 01:18:29,590
Gosh, that's too bad.
I feel so bad for him.

2425
01:18:31,220 --> 01:18:32,330
Oh, no.

2426
01:18:32,330 --> 01:18:33,490
I'm sorry.

2427
01:18:33,490 --> 01:18:34,700
- Jae Suk.
- "I'm sorry."

2428
01:18:34,700 --> 01:18:35,720
Was I like that too?

2429
01:18:35,720 --> 01:18:37,720
I'm sorry, Yuqi.

2430
01:18:38,530 --> 01:18:40,560
I just heard someone fart again.

2431
01:18:40,560 --> 01:18:41,670
Right?

2432
01:18:41,670 --> 01:18:43,630
I'm sorry you had to meet
such a pathetic senior.

2433
01:18:44,740 --> 01:18:46,210
I'm sorry, Yuqi.

2434
01:18:46,840 --> 01:18:49,840
Okay, everyone. Thanks to you,
an intense match occurred.

2435
01:18:50,000 --> 01:18:52,410
And the ranks have changed a lot.

2436
01:18:52,410 --> 01:18:55,750
As I told you before, the teams in
1st and 2nd place...

2437
01:18:55,750 --> 01:18:58,050
can use the prize money to purchase
the prize we prepared.

2438
01:18:58,050 --> 01:18:59,380
The team in last place
will get a penalty.

2439
01:18:59,380 --> 01:19:00,380
- What?
- I hope we're not in last place.

2440
01:19:00,380 --> 01:19:03,380
The penalty for the last place team
is for them to lie in here...

2441
01:19:03,490 --> 01:19:05,290
- while we make our closing remarks.
- That's easy.

2442
01:19:05,290 --> 01:19:07,350
They have to lie in there until
the end and get out by themselves.

2443
01:19:07,750 --> 01:19:09,390
- That's hard.
- After being in there for a while?

2444
01:19:09,390 --> 01:19:10,460
I see. That's hard.

2445
01:19:10,460 --> 01:19:13,740
The team that came
in last place is...

2446
01:19:13,930 --> 01:19:15,540
(The penalty is enjoying the
starch swamp during the ending.)

2447
01:19:15,540 --> 01:19:16,740
With a difference of 80 cents,

2448
01:19:16,740 --> 01:19:21,300
(Which team came in last place
with a difference of 80 cents?)

2449
01:19:22,170 --> 01:19:23,280
it's Kim Dong Jun and Jeon So Min.

2450
01:19:23,280 --> 01:19:24,280
- Yes!
- Yes!

2451
01:19:24,280 --> 01:19:25,550
(The last place team is
So Min and Dong Jun.)

2452
01:19:25,550 --> 01:19:26,550
(We're in trouble.)

2453
01:19:26,550 --> 01:19:27,970
- Oh, no.
- It was 80 cents?

2454
01:19:27,970 --> 01:19:28,970
That was the difference?

2455
01:19:28,970 --> 01:19:30,080
How much did we have?

2456
01:19:30,080 --> 01:19:31,290
7.30 dollars.

2457
01:19:31,290 --> 01:19:32,420
7 dollars?

2458
01:19:32,420 --> 01:19:33,960
If only you didn't get tteokbokki.

2459
01:19:33,960 --> 01:19:35,310
- That's true.
- If we didn't eat...

2460
01:19:35,620 --> 01:19:38,090
- We only played two games...
- Please go in.

2461
01:19:38,420 --> 01:19:40,090
I'm sorry, Dong Jun.

2462
01:19:40,920 --> 01:19:42,800
- I'm sorry, Dong Jun.
- "I'm sorry."

2463
01:19:42,800 --> 01:19:44,800
- It's all my fault.
- It's okay.

2464
01:19:44,800 --> 01:19:46,030
I'm sorry!

2465
01:19:46,500 --> 01:19:48,560
So Min, just imagine that
you're on a date.

2466
01:19:48,890 --> 01:19:50,240
- Gosh, I waited for this.
- This is like a scene from...

2467
01:19:50,240 --> 01:19:51,800
- "Love Letter". No, "Love story".
- You're right.

2468
01:19:51,800 --> 01:19:52,910
A scene from "Love Story".

2469
01:19:52,910 --> 01:19:54,410
It's like a field of snow.

2470
01:19:55,170 --> 01:19:58,840
In first place is
Kim Jong Kook and Soyou.

2471
01:19:59,000 --> 01:20:00,780
- Right.
- They got 62.10 dollars.

2472
01:20:00,780 --> 01:20:02,550
- What?
- 62.10 dollars?

2473
01:20:02,670 --> 01:20:04,510
- That's a lot.
- You guys are rich.

2474
01:20:04,510 --> 01:20:05,590
We're like Mansour.

2475
01:20:05,590 --> 01:20:07,620
The second place team can get
a prize,

2476
01:20:07,620 --> 01:20:09,590
but the third place team can't.

2477
01:20:10,050 --> 01:20:12,630
But the difference between
the 2 teams is 20 cents.

2478
01:20:13,090 --> 01:20:15,960
- 20 cents?
- It must be Yuqi and Jae Suk.

2479
01:20:15,960 --> 01:20:17,800
With 16.7 dollars,
this team is in 2nd place...

2480
01:20:17,800 --> 01:20:20,740
and can get a prize. It is...

2481
01:20:20,740 --> 01:20:24,840
(Who is the 2nd place team that beat
the 3rd place team by a hair?)

2482
01:20:26,100 --> 01:20:27,210
Jae Suk and Yuqi.

2483
01:20:27,210 --> 01:20:28,840
(Jae Suk and Yuqi came in 2nd place
with 16.70 dollars and get a prize.)

2484
01:20:28,840 --> 01:20:30,710
They got more money at the end
for going to the finals.

2485
01:20:30,710 --> 01:20:31,750
Okay!

2486
01:20:31,750 --> 01:20:33,080
Let's bring in the prizes.

2487
01:20:33,080 --> 01:20:35,550
- What is this?
- Summer blankets and sweet corn.

2488
01:20:35,550 --> 01:20:36,920
- Corn.
- This is nice.

2489
01:20:36,920 --> 01:20:38,380
They even have corn.

2490
01:20:38,920 --> 01:20:42,550
As a result, the 1st place team
can get all three of them.

2491
01:20:43,310 --> 01:20:46,380
And the team in second can pick
either summer bedding...

2492
01:20:46,380 --> 01:20:48,160
or sweet corn.

2493
01:20:48,300 --> 01:20:49,350
I want summer bedding.

2494
01:20:49,530 --> 01:20:51,420
- Summer bedding it is.
- Summer bedding it is.

2495
01:20:51,890 --> 01:20:53,420
Dong Jun, how did you like it today?

2496
01:20:54,040 --> 01:20:56,240
I don't want to be rude,
but my head...

2497
01:20:56,240 --> 01:20:57,240
Go ahead and do it.

2498
01:20:57,240 --> 01:20:59,240
How can you talk to us
lying down like that?

2499
01:20:59,500 --> 01:21:00,930
He's lying down in a TV show.

2500
01:21:00,930 --> 01:21:02,410
I can't believe he's doing this.

2501
01:21:02,410 --> 01:21:03,410
Answer me.

2502
01:21:03,600 --> 01:21:05,080
Thank you for today, So Min.

2503
01:21:05,080 --> 01:21:09,620
Dong Jun, you did a good job.
We had a lot of fun.

2504
01:21:09,620 --> 01:21:10,920
(The money from the 10th anniversary
was donated to children's charity.)

2505
01:21:11,340 --> 01:21:14,120
(They get a call one day.)

2506
01:21:14,590 --> 01:21:16,920
(They have to find their youngest
sister who cut school.)

01:21:21,800 --> 01:21:24,890
(They are the younger sisters
who want to be idols.)

2510
01:21:24,890 --> 01:21:25,890
Are you sure it's her?

2511
01:21:25,890 --> 01:21:28,500
(They never get to know
who's the real sister.)

2512
01:21:29,430 --> 01:21:32,460
(The sisters are a little tough.)

2513
01:21:33,210 --> 01:21:34,780
(I said I'd go to
an Ivy League college!)

2514
01:21:34,970 --> 01:21:37,140
(But the sisters are doing
something else in their rooms.)

2515
01:21:37,800 --> 01:21:39,140
(There's only one way.)

2516
01:21:39,140 --> 01:21:40,510
(They should believe
their sisters...)

2517
01:21:40,510 --> 01:21:42,310
(or doubt them.)

2518
01:21:42,310 --> 01:21:43,310
This is a mess.

2519
01:21:43,310 --> 01:21:44,510
(They start to have doubts.)

2520
01:21:44,510 --> 01:21:46,710
(And they even
have family squabbles.)

2521
01:21:47,660 --> 01:21:49,510
(No matter whatever they do,)

2522
01:21:49,510 --> 01:21:51,420
(they are still family.)
