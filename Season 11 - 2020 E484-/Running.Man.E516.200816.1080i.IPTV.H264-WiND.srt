1
00:00:05,700 --> 00:00:07,970
(It's drizzling.)

2
00:00:07,970 --> 00:00:10,370
(It's a training institute
in Gyeonggi Province.)

3
00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:13,660
(And there's a departure
lounge in the building.)

4
00:00:14,070 --> 00:00:15,740
Hello.

5
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,380
(She shows up slithering her way
through the production crew.)

6
00:00:20,380 --> 00:00:21,480
- Hello.
- Hello.

7
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:23,320
- Hello.
- What is So Min doing there alone?

8
00:00:23,320 --> 00:00:24,920
- Hello.
- Hello.

9
00:00:24,920 --> 00:00:26,510
- Hi.
- Hello.

10
00:00:27,080 --> 00:00:28,320
Did you gain some weight?

11
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:29,580
- Oh, you lost weight.
- No, we never talk about that.

12
00:00:29,660 --> 00:00:31,050
- Gosh, seriously. Hey.
- It's true.

13
00:00:31,050 --> 00:00:32,890
- I haven't done it in a while.
- Hello, Haha.

14
00:00:32,890 --> 00:00:35,050
- That's too much.
- Haha, why are you wearing pajamas?

15
00:00:35,050 --> 00:00:36,860
- He must be...
- My gosh.

16
00:00:36,860 --> 00:00:38,160
My wife has similar pants like them.

17
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:40,020
- He's wearing pajamas and slippers.
- They're called "fridge pants".

18
00:00:40,020 --> 00:00:41,690
- I can't believe you, Haha.
- Look at this.

19
00:00:41,690 --> 00:00:42,870
(Contempt)

20
00:00:42,970 --> 00:00:44,730
- What's with your face?
- What do you mean?

21
00:00:45,160 --> 00:00:46,370
Don't say weird things like that.

22
00:00:46,660 --> 00:00:48,770
- He's trying to change the subject.
- Don't do that.

23
00:00:48,770 --> 00:00:50,010
(Haha is making fun of his face
to change the subject.)

24
00:00:51,330 --> 00:00:52,700
(He found something
and burst out laughing.)

25
00:00:52,700 --> 00:00:53,840
- Oh, my.
- Hey, Haha.

26
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:56,150
- Did you carry our mission bag?
- Yes, I did.

27
00:00:56,340 --> 00:00:58,190
I carry it on another show as well.

28
00:00:58,190 --> 00:01:00,620
- Rumor has it that you stole it.
- That's not true.

29
00:01:00,620 --> 00:01:02,380
- Why did you take that bag?
- In that bag,

30
00:01:02,380 --> 00:01:03,980
there were only two caramels.

31
00:01:03,980 --> 00:01:06,020
- Caramels?
- Why would he take that bag?

32
00:01:06,020 --> 00:01:07,620
- It's for Running Man...
- Haha, that's why our staff...

33
00:01:07,620 --> 00:01:09,000
call you a caramel thief.

34
00:01:09,590 --> 00:01:11,500
I heard them talking in whispers
earlier.

35
00:01:11,500 --> 00:01:12,760
Haven't you heard
that stealing props brings...

36
00:01:12,760 --> 00:01:14,170
- three generations bad luck?
- Exactly.

37
00:01:14,170 --> 00:01:15,230
People actually say that.

38
00:01:15,230 --> 00:01:17,140
- It brings bad luck for 3 years.
- Oh, right. For 3 years.

39
00:01:17,140 --> 00:01:19,000
- It brings 3 generations bad luck?
- For 3 years.

40
00:01:19,030 --> 00:01:22,610
- You mean, Dream, his children,
- I heard that too.

41
00:01:22,610 --> 00:01:24,340
- and me?
- 3 years, not 3 generations.

42
00:01:24,340 --> 00:01:26,170
- You didn't make that up though.
- 3 years, not 3 generations.

43
00:01:26,170 --> 00:01:27,750
- I see.
- They say...

44
00:01:27,750 --> 00:01:29,950
- 3 generations?
- it brings bad luck for 3 years.

45
00:01:29,950 --> 00:01:32,110
- I said three generations instead.
- That's too harsh.

46
00:01:32,110 --> 00:01:34,780
That shows how dedicated I am
to Running Man.

47
00:01:35,510 --> 00:01:37,390
- What is that?
- We see his photo every week.

48
00:01:37,390 --> 00:01:38,920
- Must we talk about it?
- Let's not do this.

49
00:01:38,920 --> 00:01:40,620
- Suk Jin is...
- Let's just skip it and move on.

50
00:01:41,190 --> 00:01:43,590
- Let's just skip it and move on.
- He uploads too many photos.

51
00:01:43,590 --> 00:01:45,060
- He's practically...
- I bet he does that intentionally.

52
00:01:45,060 --> 00:01:47,000
- addicted to social media.
- We saw so many photos of him.

53
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,390
We also tried it with
the other cast members' photos.

54
00:01:48,390 --> 00:01:49,470
- Really?
- You did?

55
00:01:49,470 --> 00:01:51,760
- Is that me?
- Is she Jae Suk's mother?

56
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:53,610
- I look pretty.
- Let me have a look.

57
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:54,730
- Is this me?
- You look...

58
00:01:54,730 --> 00:01:55,940
- better than I thought you would.
- Right?

59
00:01:55,940 --> 00:01:58,080
I look like this lawyer...

60
00:01:58,080 --> 00:02:00,970
- called Choi Yoon Ah.
- Exactly.

61
00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:03,370
I met her on a TV show.

62
00:02:03,420 --> 00:02:04,420
You're right.

63
00:02:04,420 --> 00:02:05,720
Jong Kook looks like Pak Se Ri
with makeup.

64
00:02:06,310 --> 00:02:08,860
(He looks like the rich girl
who's good at golf.)

65
00:02:08,860 --> 00:02:10,220
I think I look pretty.

66
00:02:10,220 --> 00:02:12,120
My face looks quite sharp.

67
00:02:12,220 --> 00:02:14,820
- Who's next?
- Oh, man. Kwang Soo looks...

68
00:02:15,060 --> 00:02:16,290
What? Hang on.

69
00:02:16,660 --> 00:02:18,370
- He looks like...
- What? Hang on.

70
00:02:18,370 --> 00:02:19,560
I look okay.

71
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:20,720
(He just looks like
he's wearing a wig.)

72
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:22,240
He looks like
a retired volleyball player.

73
00:02:23,290 --> 00:02:25,840
- He looks like Kim Yeon Koung.
- Right?

74
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:26,940
- Is that So Min?
- Hey, but...

75
00:02:26,940 --> 00:02:28,710
your face looks so long.

76
00:02:29,070 --> 00:02:30,340
To be honest,

77
00:02:30,340 --> 00:02:32,070
I realized I shouldn't make fun of
any of you...

78
00:02:32,150 --> 00:02:33,750
because I thought it was my mother.

79
00:02:34,970 --> 00:02:36,180
- I won't say anything about you.
- Okay.

80
00:02:36,180 --> 00:02:37,910
- Please don't make fun of it.
- All right.

81
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:40,490
- And Ji Hyo looks like...
- She looks like Sung Hoon.

82
00:02:40,490 --> 00:02:41,780
- She doesn't look different.
- I think...

83
00:02:41,780 --> 00:02:44,750
- she looks like Sehun of EXO.
- Indeed. She does look like Sehun.

84
00:02:44,750 --> 00:02:45,750
Right? She looks like him.

85
00:02:45,750 --> 00:02:47,620
- She's very handsome.
- She would be if she were a man.

86
00:02:47,620 --> 00:02:49,590
- Next up is Se Chan.
- Look at him.

87
00:02:49,900 --> 00:02:52,220
- The application failed.
- My goodness.

88
00:02:52,220 --> 00:02:53,790
He beat another application.

89
00:02:54,320 --> 00:02:56,240
The application failed to
change his face.

90
00:02:56,240 --> 00:02:58,060
One of our writers looks like this.

91
00:02:58,370 --> 00:03:01,030
I don't remember her name,
but he looks a lot like her.

92
00:03:01,030 --> 00:03:03,440
- His photo is so shocking.
- Nothing can change his face.

93
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:05,070
Se Chan has his own
unchangeable image.

94
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:07,840
Actually, Se Chan needs to...

95
00:03:07,910 --> 00:03:09,540
- get a test done today.
- Yes.

96
00:03:09,620 --> 00:03:11,020
- He's not feeling well.
- It's nothing serious though.

97
00:03:11,020 --> 00:03:12,280
- It's nothing serious.
- It's a minor illness.

98
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:14,620
He just needs to get a test done.

99
00:03:14,620 --> 00:03:16,750
- We'll continue the shoot tomorrow.
- Yes.

100
00:03:16,750 --> 00:03:18,350
- He'll come tomorrow.
- He'll join us tomorrow.

101
00:03:19,460 --> 00:03:20,930
- That's a relief.
- We'll be starting the race soon.

102
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:23,900
You'll leave Korea shortly,
so please check the bags behind you.

103
00:03:23,900 --> 00:03:25,820
- I see.
- Is this important?

104
00:03:25,820 --> 00:03:26,930
- We'll leave Korea?
- Where?

105
00:03:26,930 --> 00:03:29,440
- It must be this week's theme.
- It's a theme.

106
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:30,770
- What is it?
- It says, "Running..."

107
00:03:30,770 --> 00:03:32,630
- It says, "Pre-season Training".
- Soccer?

108
00:03:32,630 --> 00:03:34,600
- "Morning Soccer Club..."
- "Pre-season Training"?

109
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:36,710
- They don't do pre-season training.
- I like the idea.

110
00:03:36,710 --> 00:03:38,440
- A morning soccer club?
- Are we going to play soccer?

111
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:40,870
You are members of
Running Morning Soccer Club.

112
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:44,250
- You'll leave for the training.
- Is that so?

113
00:03:44,250 --> 00:03:47,520
We invited three outside players
to join you for the training.

114
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:48,960
- Really? We have more players?
- Outside players?

115
00:03:49,750 --> 00:03:52,190
I... I'm just worried
I might be a nuisance.

116
00:03:53,380 --> 00:03:55,930
(After receiving soccer balls
from the staff,)

117
00:03:56,900 --> 00:03:59,900
(three mysterious players
entered with the soccer balls.)

118
00:03:59,900 --> 00:04:02,060
(Surprised)

119
00:04:02,060 --> 00:04:03,090
Oh, my.

120
00:04:03,090 --> 00:04:04,560
- You should've told us...
- Dae Myeung is here.

121
00:04:05,500 --> 00:04:07,530
- Hello.
- Welcome.

122
00:04:07,530 --> 00:04:08,710
I was so surprised.

123
00:04:08,940 --> 00:04:11,810
(Kwak Do Won, Kim Sang Ho,
Kim Dae Myeung)

124
00:04:12,370 --> 00:04:15,750
(The three great actors gathered
for the movie "The Golden Holiday".)

125
00:04:16,310 --> 00:04:19,650
(They will show off their perfect
chemistry in the movie.)

126
00:04:19,650 --> 00:04:21,240
(Today, they will maximize
their chemistry on Running Man.)

127
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:24,110
- They rarely go on a variety show.
- Exactly.

128
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:25,960
Before we begin...

129
00:04:26,390 --> 00:04:29,700
The three of them starred in
the movie "The Golden Holiday".

130
00:04:29,960 --> 00:04:31,860
Kwak Do Won, Kim Sang Ho,

131
00:04:31,970 --> 00:04:33,530
and Kim Dae Myeung are here.

132
00:04:34,090 --> 00:04:36,030
- Hello.
- It's nice to meet you.

133
00:04:36,030 --> 00:04:37,270
(Welcome.)

134
00:04:37,470 --> 00:04:38,970
Do Won, could you...

135
00:04:38,970 --> 00:04:40,210
You brought soccer balls.

136
00:04:40,430 --> 00:04:41,710
I don't know. They told us to.

137
00:04:41,710 --> 00:04:42,880
(He speaks in a friendly way.)

138
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:44,100
- You see...
- He looks so natural.

139
00:04:44,100 --> 00:04:46,650
There's always someone like him
in every morning soccer club.

140
00:04:46,650 --> 00:04:49,110
- Holding a bottle of makgeolli.
- There's always someone like him.

141
00:04:49,110 --> 00:04:51,650
- He'd play only for five minutes.
- He looks so natural.

142
00:04:51,650 --> 00:04:54,340
- Sitting in a shade.
- Please say hello to the viewers.

143
00:04:54,340 --> 00:04:57,680
Hello. I starred in the movie
"The Golden Holiday"...

144
00:04:58,220 --> 00:04:59,630
Basically, I'm here
to promote the movie.

145
00:05:00,660 --> 00:05:01,900
- I'm not good at this.
- He's honest.

146
00:05:01,900 --> 00:05:03,630
- We all know that now.
- We all know that.

147
00:05:03,700 --> 00:05:05,900
- Of course, we know.
- Following "Steel Rain 2: Summit",

148
00:05:05,900 --> 00:05:07,130
you starred in "The Golden Holiday".

149
00:05:07,130 --> 00:05:08,770
I'd like to tell you something
before we begin.

150
00:05:08,770 --> 00:05:11,340
- I had a shoot all night.
- Oh, I see.

151
00:05:11,340 --> 00:05:14,230
So my voice is hoarse now.

152
00:05:14,340 --> 00:05:16,140
- So I...
- What did you shoot?

153
00:05:16,140 --> 00:05:17,340
The movie title is "Firefighters".

154
00:05:17,340 --> 00:05:18,380
- "Firefighters"?
- You're shooting another film?

155
00:05:18,380 --> 00:05:20,280
- Anyway...
- We heard four movie titles...

156
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:21,600
- in only 20 seconds...
- All right. Be quiet.

157
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:22,780
Why would you...

158
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:24,580
- In only 20 seconds...
- All right. Be quiet.

159
00:05:24,580 --> 00:05:26,320
(Angry)

160
00:05:26,390 --> 00:05:27,740
- But we just heard...
- Be quiet.

161
00:05:27,740 --> 00:05:29,550
- Do Won is talking.
- four movies...

162
00:05:29,550 --> 00:05:31,410
- Stop it.
- He's right. That's enough.

163
00:05:31,410 --> 00:05:33,890
- Do Won, please continue.
- Yes?

164
00:05:33,890 --> 00:05:35,630
- Let him finish.
- Go ahead. What is it?

165
00:05:35,630 --> 00:05:37,790
Even Do Won also pretended
he didn't hear me.

166
00:05:39,470 --> 00:05:41,470
(Ignoring Kwang Soo is popular
among actors as well.)

167
00:05:41,470 --> 00:05:43,290
That would be great to use
to make a video clip, right?

168
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:44,470
That was good, right?

169
00:05:44,470 --> 00:05:45,730
Gosh, seriously.

170
00:05:45,730 --> 00:05:47,930
- That's also my job.
- I see.

171
00:05:48,070 --> 00:05:50,600
- People love to watch it.
- You work so hard.

172
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:51,780
- Of course, I work hard.
- Some people like it.

173
00:05:51,780 --> 00:05:53,650
Dae Myeung, please say hello
to the viewers.

174
00:05:53,740 --> 00:05:55,410
- Hello.
- He's a great actor.

175
00:05:55,470 --> 00:05:57,340
It's nice to meet you.
I'm Kim Dae Myeung.

176
00:05:58,890 --> 00:06:00,180
He's the best.

177
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:02,910
You starred with Kwang Soo
in "The Sound of Your Heart".

178
00:06:02,910 --> 00:06:04,180
That's right.

179
00:06:04,180 --> 00:06:05,460
- He played Kwang Soo's brother.
- Yes.

180
00:06:05,530 --> 00:06:07,830
How was Kwang Soo back then?

181
00:06:07,830 --> 00:06:08,900
Wasn't he arrogant?

182
00:06:08,900 --> 00:06:10,790
No, he was very polite...

183
00:06:10,790 --> 00:06:13,630
and nice to other people
as far as I remember.

184
00:06:13,630 --> 00:06:17,030
But he looked completely different
on Running Man.

185
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:18,470
He's not in his right mind here.

186
00:06:19,070 --> 00:06:20,160
(He has a different persona
on Running Man.)

187
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:21,270
He's crazy.

188
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:23,780
Jong Kook thinks everyone is crazy
except for himself.

189
00:06:24,910 --> 00:06:28,240
- He's the only normal person.
- In the whole world.

190
00:06:29,650 --> 00:06:31,610
Sang Ho, please say hello
to the viewers.

191
00:06:31,740 --> 00:06:32,980
It's nice to meet you.
I'm Kim Sang Ho.

192
00:06:32,980 --> 00:06:34,150
(Kim Sang Ho, the acting artisan
who can pull off any character)

193
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:37,350
- He was on "Village Survival".
- Yes, we worked together.

194
00:06:37,460 --> 00:06:39,220
We starred in
"City Hunter" together.

195
00:06:39,220 --> 00:06:40,980
- That's right. We worked together.
- Yes.

196
00:06:40,980 --> 00:06:42,960
- We went to the Philippines,
- Yes.

197
00:06:43,330 --> 00:06:45,030
and he was like a Korean Wave star.

198
00:06:45,030 --> 00:06:46,990
So many fans would
follow him around.

199
00:06:47,030 --> 00:06:49,770
- Because of the drama?
- Everyone recognized him.

200
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:52,210
They all just asked me...

201
00:06:52,300 --> 00:06:53,470
where Lee Min Ho was.

202
00:06:53,470 --> 00:06:54,600
(The fans asked me
where Lee Min Ho was.)

203
00:06:54,730 --> 00:06:56,210
I said, "I don't know."

204
00:06:57,840 --> 00:06:59,780
Everyone recognized him.

205
00:06:59,780 --> 00:07:01,040
(Sang Ho is treated as a top star
like Lee Min Ho.)

206
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:04,650
- You're internationally popular.
- He must be.

207
00:07:04,650 --> 00:07:05,910
Kwang Soo is the one
who's internationally popular.

208
00:07:06,110 --> 00:07:07,410
(Bowing)

209
00:07:07,410 --> 00:07:10,090
Next up is Dae Myeung.

210
00:07:10,320 --> 00:07:11,680
(As he complimented Kwang Soo
unexpectedly,)

211
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:13,330
(Jae Suk glanced at Kwang Soo,)

212
00:07:13,330 --> 00:07:15,630
(and changed the subject.)

213
00:07:17,090 --> 00:07:19,070
There's nothing wrong
with talking about me.

214
00:07:19,070 --> 00:07:20,470
- It was good enough.
- Calm down.

215
00:07:20,470 --> 00:07:21,770
- It was interesting. Don't worry.
- It was good.

216
00:07:21,770 --> 00:07:25,470
We need to hear as many stories as
we can while interviewing them.

217
00:07:25,470 --> 00:07:28,880
- Don't try to get more air time.
- Exactly.

218
00:07:29,010 --> 00:07:31,800
Now, we're going to leave
for the soccer training.

219
00:07:31,910 --> 00:07:35,380
- You'll go through security.
- What do you mean?

220
00:07:35,380 --> 00:07:36,610
Please go through security.

221
00:07:36,820 --> 00:07:39,650
(The state
of the art equipment appeared.)

222
00:07:39,650 --> 00:07:41,540
Only the ones with bags should
go through it.

223
00:07:41,610 --> 00:07:43,260
Only the ones with bags.

224
00:07:43,910 --> 00:07:45,830
- I'm nervous.
- Go ahead.

225
00:07:45,830 --> 00:07:47,180
(Do Won is going through it
with the soccer balls.)

226
00:07:47,550 --> 00:07:48,590
- But...
- Go ahead.

227
00:07:48,590 --> 00:07:49,630
(Beeping)

228
00:07:50,850 --> 00:07:53,660
(The alarm went off.)

229
00:07:53,790 --> 00:07:55,340
- But...
- What?

230
00:07:55,430 --> 00:07:56,700
- He has something.
- He got caught.

231
00:07:56,790 --> 00:07:57,970
What's going on?

232
00:07:58,030 --> 00:07:59,860
- He got caught.
- Kwak Do Won.

233
00:07:59,970 --> 00:08:01,010
He got caught.

234
00:08:01,010 --> 00:08:02,530
A suspicious object
has been detected.

235
00:08:02,530 --> 00:08:03,970
I will search your belongings.

236
00:08:04,100 --> 00:08:06,010
(A suspicious object?)

237
00:08:06,010 --> 00:08:07,210
- I will search your belongings.
- What's going on?

238
00:08:08,170 --> 00:08:09,380
Is there something inside the balls?

239
00:08:09,450 --> 00:08:10,720
I think there's something
inside the balls.

240
00:08:11,670 --> 00:08:13,240
(Looking at the agent)

241
00:08:13,890 --> 00:08:14,980
What could it be?

242
00:08:14,980 --> 00:08:16,050
(He's watching the process
with his hands behind the back.)

243
00:08:16,050 --> 00:08:17,980
If you look at Do Won's pose,
he looks like he's thinking,

244
00:08:17,980 --> 00:08:19,330
"What on earth is going on?"

245
00:08:19,850 --> 00:08:21,480
As if he's thinking, "Hurry up."

246
00:08:22,830 --> 00:08:24,790
- There must be something in there.
- What is it?

247
00:08:24,790 --> 00:08:25,970
(He's cutting open the ball
with shaking hands.)

248
00:08:25,970 --> 00:08:27,530
He's cutting it. I guess there's
something in the ball.

249
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:30,860
Something inside the ball
was detected.

250
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:32,640
(The assistant director is
moving his hands nervously.)

251
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:33,800
He looks serious.

252
00:08:34,710 --> 00:08:36,470
- Seriously.
- If it requires acting skills...

253
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:38,280
Don't be nervous.

254
00:08:39,480 --> 00:08:41,440
(His dry lips are trembling.)

255
00:08:41,700 --> 00:08:44,250
Why is he shaking?
Hyeong Gu, why are you shaking?

256
00:08:44,280 --> 00:08:46,180
It's because he has no acting
experience. He's our staff.

257
00:08:46,390 --> 00:08:49,020
You should register in
an acting class.

258
00:08:49,020 --> 00:08:50,020
(Being the assistant director of
Running Man requires acting skills.)

259
00:08:50,620 --> 00:08:52,180
(Their criticisms made him
even more nervous.)

260
00:08:52,180 --> 00:08:54,180
Oh, there's... I think there's
something in it.

261
00:08:54,180 --> 00:08:57,360
(His lack of dexterity
frustrates everyone.)

262
00:08:57,360 --> 00:08:58,560
Gosh. I'll do it.

263
00:08:59,030 --> 00:09:00,030
Move.

264
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:01,820
(He ended up losing his patience.)

265
00:09:01,820 --> 00:09:03,640
- Do Won, please calm down.
- Gosh.

266
00:09:03,640 --> 00:09:05,000
- He's doing it by himself.
- No, please.

267
00:09:05,700 --> 00:09:06,960
- Move.
- Please calm down.

268
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:08,530
- Gosh, seriously.
- He's doing it by himself.

269
00:09:09,640 --> 00:09:10,700
He's doing it by himself.

270
00:09:10,700 --> 00:09:11,780
(Startled)

271
00:09:11,830 --> 00:09:13,980
(He lacks acting skills
and gets scared easily.)

272
00:09:13,980 --> 00:09:15,910
You can do it from above like this.

273
00:09:16,980 --> 00:09:19,150
Look at Do Won. My goodness.

274
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:23,310
What is he doing?

275
00:09:23,450 --> 00:09:25,920
- Why is it taking you so long?
- He can't do it.

276
00:09:26,630 --> 00:09:28,280
Will a pigeon come out of it
or something?

277
00:09:28,490 --> 00:09:29,690
(By the time everyone is
getting tired...)

278
00:09:29,690 --> 00:09:30,860
It's just a ball.

279
00:09:32,370 --> 00:09:35,130
(He found mysterious white powder!)

280
00:09:35,770 --> 00:09:38,290
(Something was found in the ball.)

281
00:09:38,290 --> 00:09:39,410
Is that drug?

282
00:09:39,530 --> 00:09:41,240
(What is that?)

283
00:09:42,930 --> 00:09:44,140
In the ball,

284
00:09:44,140 --> 00:09:46,480
seasoned salt was found,
which is a hazardous item.

285
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:48,750
(Is seasoned salt a hazardous item?)

286
00:09:48,750 --> 00:09:49,880
- I'm sorry, but...
- Seasoned salt?

287
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:52,210
Hold on. I'm sorry, but can that
be detected by a metal detector?

288
00:09:52,620 --> 00:09:54,780
Why is seasoned salt
a hazardous item?

289
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:57,310
Why is seasoned salt
a hazardous item?

290
00:09:57,310 --> 00:09:59,180
(The assistant director left
after leaving the seasoned salt.)

291
00:09:59,180 --> 00:10:00,420
And why is the studio...

292
00:10:00,730 --> 00:10:03,130
Seasoned salt was found...

293
00:10:03,130 --> 00:10:04,630
in Do Won's soccer ball.

294
00:10:04,630 --> 00:10:06,660
Then you should arrest him.

295
00:10:06,660 --> 00:10:10,060
Therefore, Do Won is arrested in
the act of smuggling seasoned salt,

296
00:10:10,190 --> 00:10:12,330
- and on the suspect list.
- Okay.

297
00:10:12,770 --> 00:10:16,240
Do Won, please put on
the suspect uniform now.

298
00:10:16,930 --> 00:10:19,150
He's a suspect. He became
a suspect from the beginning.

299
00:10:19,150 --> 00:10:20,150
(He became a suspect in an instant.)

300
00:10:20,150 --> 00:10:22,850
Everyone, today's mission is
to find out the criminals...

301
00:10:22,850 --> 00:10:25,520
who are in the morning soccer club.
It's the anti-criminal operation,

302
00:10:25,810 --> 00:10:27,440
Domestic Investigation Race.

303
00:10:28,520 --> 00:10:32,160
Among the 10 members
of the morning soccer club,

304
00:10:32,260 --> 00:10:35,630
there are two criminals who tried
to smuggle seasoned salt out...

305
00:10:36,420 --> 00:10:38,030
and two police officers
who infiltrated into...

306
00:10:38,030 --> 00:10:39,630
the group to catch the criminals.

307
00:10:39,630 --> 00:10:41,060
(There are 2 police officers who are
here to catch the criminals.)

308
00:10:41,060 --> 00:10:42,430
There are police officers as well?

309
00:10:42,430 --> 00:10:46,030
If the officers fail to arrest the
two criminals or get eliminated...

310
00:10:46,510 --> 00:10:48,930
during the race, the criminals win.

311
00:10:49,380 --> 00:10:51,880
If they arrest the two criminals,

312
00:10:51,930 --> 00:10:53,880
the officers and citizens win.

313
00:10:54,040 --> 00:10:57,210
The winners will get a prize,
and the losers will get a penalty.

314
00:10:57,710 --> 00:11:00,680
And Do Won is a suspect here,
so if his team loses,

315
00:11:00,780 --> 00:11:04,260
two people including himself
will get a penalty.

316
00:11:04,410 --> 00:11:06,490
So you'd better try your best
to make your team win.

317
00:11:06,490 --> 00:11:07,730
So it's about reasoning again.

318
00:11:08,730 --> 00:11:10,530
(Sang Ho wasn't so good
at reasoning in "Village Survival".)

319
00:11:10,630 --> 00:11:12,690
Gosh, I'm not good at it.
This is crazy.

320
00:11:12,820 --> 00:11:14,790
- I'm here to have fun.
- Sang Ho hates reasoning.

321
00:11:14,790 --> 00:11:16,430
- You should just run.
- He really hates it.

322
00:11:16,430 --> 00:11:17,600
He seems to hate it.

323
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:20,430
Let's move on to the next place
to start the race then.

324
00:11:20,430 --> 00:11:21,800
- Okay.
- Okay.

325
00:11:21,870 --> 00:11:22,930
Good.

326
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:26,150
- Let's have a seat.
- Okay.

327
00:11:28,170 --> 00:11:29,350
(Groaning)

328
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:34,490
(He keeps groaning which doesn't
happen a lot on variety shows.)

329
00:11:34,490 --> 00:11:37,050
(He sounds so friendly.)

330
00:11:40,050 --> 00:11:41,820
Please give me a bottle of water.

331
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:43,730
Just throw it.

332
00:11:43,730 --> 00:11:45,190
Please give me a bottle of water.

333
00:11:45,190 --> 00:11:47,870
(Kwang Soo starts moving right away
as soon as he hears it.)

334
00:11:47,870 --> 00:11:49,770
- Look at Kwang Soo.
- Kwang Soo is nice.

335
00:11:50,060 --> 00:11:52,240
I guess this is how
he's become Asian Prince.

336
00:11:53,270 --> 00:11:54,870
- Kwang Soo, I want one too.
- Okay.

337
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:57,410
(He's an official errand boy.)

338
00:11:57,410 --> 00:11:58,880
Kwang Soo, why are you going around
during the shoot?

339
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:00,750
- It's not like that.
- Why are you wandering around?

340
00:12:00,750 --> 00:12:03,350
The director is waiting for you.
Behave yourself.

341
00:12:03,410 --> 00:12:04,810
We can't start because of Kwang Soo.

342
00:12:04,810 --> 00:12:06,210
Kwang Soo,
we can't start the shoot...

343
00:12:06,210 --> 00:12:07,520
- because of you.
- Sit down.

344
00:12:08,280 --> 00:12:09,520
We should work.

345
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:10,950
My goodness.

346
00:12:10,950 --> 00:12:13,390
Can't you walk around the streets
in Southeast Asian countries?

347
00:12:13,390 --> 00:12:14,530
That's not true.

348
00:12:14,530 --> 00:12:16,630
Can't he walk around the streets
in Southeast Asia?

349
00:12:16,630 --> 00:12:17,790
- Kwang Soo?
- It's not like that.

350
00:12:17,790 --> 00:12:19,320
- He can walk around.
- He can?

351
00:12:19,530 --> 00:12:22,900
(He's popular, but he has
no problem getting around.)

352
00:12:23,240 --> 00:12:24,960
All right. Here's the first mission.

353
00:12:24,960 --> 00:12:28,510
Those who win this mission
will get the first hint.

354
00:12:29,010 --> 00:12:32,010
It's the nationwide survey,
Anxious Seat Lineup.

355
00:12:32,070 --> 00:12:33,070
Okay.

356
00:12:33,150 --> 00:12:36,670
We conducted a survey of
people of all ages beforehand.

357
00:12:37,250 --> 00:12:39,490
We will give you a keyword
of a survey in each round.

358
00:12:39,540 --> 00:12:41,180
With the keyword,
you will split into two teams.

359
00:12:41,180 --> 00:12:44,050
Once the teams are decided,
we will reveal the survey.

360
00:12:44,050 --> 00:12:45,660
Then each team will select...

361
00:12:45,660 --> 00:12:48,950
two members who are likely
to be ranked highest.

362
00:12:48,950 --> 00:12:50,660
The four members will sit
on the conveyor.

363
00:12:50,660 --> 00:12:53,790
The team with lower ranks
will be sent into the penalty room.

364
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:56,190
- There's a penalty room?
- My gosh.

365
00:12:56,190 --> 00:12:57,290
(The team with lower ranks
will be sent into the penalty room.)

366
00:12:57,290 --> 00:12:59,300
- Gosh, it's confusing.
- I know.

367
00:12:59,300 --> 00:13:01,240
I understand the part
where we split into teams.

368
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:03,170
What are you writing down?

369
00:13:03,170 --> 00:13:04,380
Why are you putting it down?

370
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:06,300
I just don't understand it.

371
00:13:06,440 --> 00:13:09,170
I watched this show a lot,

372
00:13:09,780 --> 00:13:10,850
but I still don't
understand the rules.

373
00:13:10,850 --> 00:13:12,580
They will explain the rules again.

374
00:13:12,580 --> 00:13:14,890
I get the part where we are
divided into teams.

375
00:13:15,180 --> 00:13:17,450
Once you're split into two teams...

376
00:13:17,450 --> 00:13:20,050
(The director is explaining
the rules again.)

377
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:22,360
You will pick two people who are
likely to be ranked highest.

378
00:13:22,360 --> 00:13:24,190
- For example, the strongest...
- Okay.

379
00:13:24,190 --> 00:13:25,530
I understand it perfectly.

380
00:13:25,530 --> 00:13:27,100
(Okay. I understand it perfectly.)

381
00:13:27,690 --> 00:13:31,330
(The actors keep
cutting Kwang Soo off.)

382
00:13:31,330 --> 00:13:33,460
- Gosh, why did you do that?
- Nice.

383
00:13:33,460 --> 00:13:34,700
I just tried to make things clear.

384
00:13:34,700 --> 00:13:36,700
Nicely done, Sang Ho.

385
00:13:36,700 --> 00:13:38,200
(It's always fun
to cut Kwang Soo off.)

386
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:39,750
It's fun, isn't it?

387
00:13:39,750 --> 00:13:41,880
- This is fun.
- I know. It's really fun.

388
00:13:41,880 --> 00:13:45,380
It's Jae Suk's fault!

389
00:13:45,380 --> 00:13:46,890
(It's Jae Suk's fault!)

390
00:13:48,210 --> 00:13:50,710
Let me give you
the first keyword then.

391
00:13:50,810 --> 00:13:53,860
The first keyword is office workers.

392
00:13:53,860 --> 00:13:54,990
(Keyword: Office workers)

393
00:13:54,990 --> 00:13:56,500
The keyword is office workers.

394
00:13:56,500 --> 00:13:57,730
- Office workers?
- Yes.

395
00:13:57,820 --> 00:13:59,190
Someone who'd make
a good office worker?

396
00:13:59,190 --> 00:14:01,660
The person who'd be good
at working at a company.

397
00:14:01,660 --> 00:14:04,500
Since Do Won is the suspect,
he gets to pick...

398
00:14:04,500 --> 00:14:06,870
five members who are likely
to be ranked high.

399
00:14:07,660 --> 00:14:10,380
The question can be the person
who'd make a good office worker...

400
00:14:10,380 --> 00:14:11,910
- or a bad one.
- Exactly.

401
00:14:11,910 --> 00:14:12,910
We don't know it yet.

402
00:14:12,910 --> 00:14:15,200
So Do Won needs to think carefully.

403
00:14:15,350 --> 00:14:16,570
It's about office workers.

404
00:14:17,070 --> 00:14:18,570
Do Won should pick well.

405
00:14:18,650 --> 00:14:20,410
1, 2, 3, 4, and 5.

406
00:14:20,410 --> 00:14:21,680
1, 2, 3...

407
00:14:21,710 --> 00:14:22,860
Let's split here.

408
00:14:22,860 --> 00:14:24,910
- Just like that?
- He sounds so insincere.

409
00:14:24,910 --> 00:14:25,990
Let's split here.

410
00:14:26,680 --> 00:14:28,080
- Just like that?
- He sounds so insincere.

411
00:14:28,080 --> 00:14:30,000
- That's nice.
- He just cut us in half.

412
00:14:30,860 --> 00:14:32,900
- That's neat.
- He's bold.

413
00:14:32,900 --> 00:14:34,400
- He just doesn't want to move,
- What was that?

414
00:14:34,770 --> 00:14:36,830
so he cut us in half.
How could he do that?

415
00:14:36,830 --> 00:14:39,030
I like Mr. Kwak.
He seems broad-minded.

416
00:14:39,030 --> 00:14:41,510
- Mr. Kwak.
- You know "The Man Standing Next".

417
00:14:41,510 --> 00:14:42,670
(Kwak Do Won, Manager,
He plays his cards right.)

418
00:14:42,670 --> 00:14:45,170
- It's simple and neat this way.
- I agree.

419
00:14:45,170 --> 00:14:47,780
So you are now Team Blue
and Team Red.

420
00:14:47,780 --> 00:14:49,480
- Okay.
- I'll tell you about the survey.

421
00:14:49,570 --> 00:14:52,680
We asked this question
to office workers.

422
00:14:52,680 --> 00:14:54,310
(Office workers)

423
00:14:54,310 --> 00:14:56,950
"The person whom
you don't want as your boss."

424
00:14:56,950 --> 00:14:58,080
- What?
- The person you don't want.

425
00:14:58,080 --> 00:15:01,920
(The person whom office workers
don't want as their boss)

426
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:03,500
The question is "The person whom
you don't want as your boss".

427
00:15:03,500 --> 00:15:04,690
- It must be Jong Kook.
- Jong Kook.

428
00:15:04,690 --> 00:15:06,160
I'm sure it's Jong Kook...

429
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:07,960
- or Kwak Do Won.
- I think it's Kwak Do Won.

430
00:15:07,960 --> 00:15:09,290
It must be one of these two.

431
00:15:09,500 --> 00:15:12,660
Let's imagine
that Kwang Soo is our boss.

432
00:15:12,660 --> 00:15:14,460
- The company would go under.
- It will go under. I agree.

433
00:15:14,460 --> 00:15:16,240
- Why would you say that?
- It's a bogus company.

434
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:17,670
It will soon go under.

435
00:15:17,670 --> 00:15:19,880
We just need to pick
a boss we don't want.

436
00:15:19,880 --> 00:15:21,380
Why would you talk
about a company going under?

437
00:15:21,380 --> 00:15:25,070
I think Jae Suk will say
good things all day,

438
00:15:25,250 --> 00:15:26,890
so he won't make a good boss.

439
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:29,580
- You said nice things first...
- He nags a lot.

440
00:15:29,580 --> 00:15:32,760
The beginning and end of your speech
are totally different.

441
00:15:32,760 --> 00:15:35,230
It'd be nice to hear good things
for the first one minute.

442
00:15:35,230 --> 00:15:36,790
- You think?
- But it would last for hours.

443
00:15:36,790 --> 00:15:37,950
He wouldn't stop talking.

444
00:15:37,950 --> 00:15:39,730
Each team should pick two members.

445
00:15:39,770 --> 00:15:42,770
It should be me and Do Won.

446
00:15:42,770 --> 00:15:44,660
- Okay.
- This is about images.

447
00:15:45,400 --> 00:15:47,700
- You should definitely go up there.
- It should be you and me.

448
00:15:47,700 --> 00:15:49,140
I think people wouldn't want me.

449
00:15:49,140 --> 00:15:50,910
It should be you and me.

450
00:15:50,910 --> 00:15:52,480
Do Won and I will go up.

451
00:15:52,700 --> 00:15:55,110
- I have no idea.
- I'm sure Jae Suk is ranked high.

452
00:15:55,480 --> 00:15:57,810
I'm not sure who will win.
I'm so curious.

453
00:15:57,810 --> 00:15:59,520
- So the thing is...
- This is...

454
00:15:59,520 --> 00:16:02,020
the team who's ranked higher wins.

455
00:16:02,020 --> 00:16:04,760
- Exactly.
- If we don't win, we get a penalty.

456
00:16:04,760 --> 00:16:05,820
I see.

457
00:16:05,820 --> 00:16:07,680
It moves
either to the left or right.

458
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:09,420
We will put together your rankings,

459
00:16:09,420 --> 00:16:11,860
and the team with
the smaller number will win.

460
00:16:11,900 --> 00:16:14,420
And the conveyor will move
towards the losing team.

461
00:16:14,420 --> 00:16:16,140
- Good.
- Let's do this!

462
00:16:16,770 --> 00:16:18,900
I'm sure they're ranked 1st and 2nd.

463
00:16:18,900 --> 00:16:21,510
He just doesn't know about himself.

464
00:16:21,510 --> 00:16:22,780
All right. One.

465
00:16:22,780 --> 00:16:24,430
(Which team will get a penalty?)

466
00:16:24,430 --> 00:16:26,980
- Two.
- He will say good things all day.

467
00:16:27,700 --> 00:16:29,070
- He wouldn't make a good boss.
- Three.

468
00:16:29,150 --> 00:16:30,710
If the conveyor moves this way,
does that mean we win?

469
00:16:30,710 --> 00:16:32,710
- See? I knew it.
- Did we lose?

470
00:16:32,890 --> 00:16:33,910
- Right.
- Three.

471
00:16:33,910 --> 00:16:35,780
(Jae Suk and Do Won win.)

472
00:16:35,780 --> 00:16:37,210
(Jae Suk and Do Won are
not desirable bosses.)

473
00:16:37,210 --> 00:16:39,280
- You win.
- We win?

474
00:16:39,280 --> 00:16:41,030
- It's moving this way.
- We win.

475
00:16:41,030 --> 00:16:42,160
(They don't get a penalty,
but they're not pleased.)

476
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:43,530
Well done.

477
00:16:43,860 --> 00:16:44,950
I knew it.

478
00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:46,900
- That's high.
- Okay.

479
00:16:46,900 --> 00:16:48,030
(Jong Kook and Suk Jin are
in the penalty room.)

480
00:16:48,030 --> 00:16:49,560
- We're doomed.
- Okay.

481
00:16:49,560 --> 00:16:50,640
This is disappointing.

482
00:16:50,640 --> 00:16:52,100
- Gosh, hang on.
- What's wrong?

483
00:16:52,460 --> 00:16:53,560
- Hey!
- That's enough.

484
00:16:53,560 --> 00:16:55,560
That's just too much.

485
00:16:55,560 --> 00:16:57,010
(What's happening
in the penalty room?)

486
00:16:57,010 --> 00:16:58,330
Why? What's going on?

487
00:16:58,380 --> 00:16:59,940
I can hear a spray.

488
00:16:59,940 --> 00:17:01,610
(Jong Koo and Suk Jin
are coming out.)

489
00:17:01,610 --> 00:17:02,780
- They're here.
- Okay.

490
00:17:02,780 --> 00:17:04,480
- They're coming out.
- Come on.

491
00:17:04,940 --> 00:17:06,410
- My goodness.
- Gosh, this is a little...

492
00:17:07,080 --> 00:17:08,250
You look younger.

493
00:17:08,540 --> 00:17:09,560
This is...

494
00:17:09,560 --> 00:17:10,790
(Giggling)

495
00:17:10,790 --> 00:17:12,520
You've become younger.

496
00:17:13,090 --> 00:17:14,830
- Let's go down.
- What's that?

497
00:17:15,180 --> 00:17:17,130
It's not a penalty.

498
00:17:17,250 --> 00:17:19,600
Jong Kook, your hair looks
like the Korean flag.

499
00:17:19,600 --> 00:17:22,930
- I know.
- It's the World Cup all over again.

500
00:17:22,930 --> 00:17:25,430
As I saw Suk Jin, I thought...

501
00:17:25,430 --> 00:17:27,310
he seemed somewhat familiar.

502
00:17:27,310 --> 00:17:29,040
In "What on Earth", there was...

503
00:17:29,040 --> 00:17:30,640
a middle-aged man
who tries to look young.

504
00:17:32,230 --> 00:17:33,240
(There's a middle-aged man
who lives a young life.)

505
00:17:33,240 --> 00:17:35,110
- Exactly.
- He's just like the man.

506
00:17:35,110 --> 00:17:37,510
"I walk around the traditional
market with dyed hair."

507
00:17:37,510 --> 00:17:39,440
- He tries to look young.
- With a funny T-shirt.

508
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:40,790
He lives a young life.

509
00:17:40,890 --> 00:17:42,320
My gosh, it's so funny.

510
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:44,210
Let me tell you the survey result.

511
00:17:44,210 --> 00:17:45,390
We surveyed office workers
in their 30s and 40s.

512
00:17:45,390 --> 00:17:46,420
Jae Suk is in first place.

513
00:17:46,420 --> 00:17:47,480
Gosh, Jae Suk is number one.

514
00:17:47,480 --> 00:17:49,060
- Look at that.
- Jong Kook is in second place.

515
00:17:49,060 --> 00:17:50,160
It's so close.

516
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:51,450
I knew it. There's my name.

517
00:17:51,450 --> 00:17:53,800
- So we won.
- No, it's a tie.

518
00:17:53,800 --> 00:17:55,600
But the team
who's ranked higher wins.

519
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:57,340
- That's right.
- Really?

520
00:17:57,340 --> 00:18:00,310
People say Jae Suk
and Jong Kook would nag a lot.

521
00:18:00,310 --> 00:18:01,930
- They think we'd nag a lot.
- I know.

522
00:18:01,930 --> 00:18:03,910
- And Kwang Soo is number three.
- Why is that?

523
00:18:03,910 --> 00:18:06,270
- What about Kwang Soo?
- They say he'd be too mischievous.

524
00:18:06,550 --> 00:18:07,580
I look mischievous.

525
00:18:07,580 --> 00:18:08,740
What about Suk Jin?

526
00:18:08,740 --> 00:18:10,270
Suk Jin looks condescending.

527
00:18:10,270 --> 00:18:12,350
(They picked Suk Jin
because he seems condescending.)

528
00:18:12,650 --> 00:18:14,240
(He tries to look nice
with partly dyed hair.)

529
00:18:14,390 --> 00:18:15,790
Let's move on
to the second question.

530
00:18:15,790 --> 00:18:17,660
Nice. All right. We won anyway.

531
00:18:17,660 --> 00:18:19,560
Here's the second question.

532
00:18:19,630 --> 00:18:21,660
- We surveyed housewives.
- Okay.

533
00:18:21,920 --> 00:18:24,220
- The person...
- Who'd help around the house.

534
00:18:24,950 --> 00:18:26,630
who'd be messiest.

535
00:18:26,630 --> 00:18:29,020
(Who do housewives think
would be the messiest person?)

536
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:31,160
My gosh.

537
00:18:31,160 --> 00:18:34,960
(They all stare at one person
at the same time.)

538
00:18:35,430 --> 00:18:37,040
He's too strong a candidate.

539
00:18:37,380 --> 00:18:39,310
- He's hard to beat.
- In our team...

540
00:18:40,170 --> 00:18:41,610
Our team...

541
00:18:41,610 --> 00:18:43,770
I just want him
to go up there himself.

542
00:18:44,550 --> 00:18:46,240
I want him to
go up there spontaneously.

543
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:48,050
- We have one strong candidate.
- We have one person in mind.

544
00:18:48,050 --> 00:18:50,390
- I don't want to point him out.
- We have a winner.

545
00:18:50,510 --> 00:18:52,360
He's just too strong.

546
00:18:52,360 --> 00:18:54,830
I think all the five members
of this team put together...

547
00:18:54,830 --> 00:18:56,360
can't beat him.

548
00:18:57,630 --> 00:18:59,660
- Ji Hyo and Sang Ho are going up.
- Okay.

549
00:18:59,660 --> 00:19:01,130
Our team is really...

550
00:19:01,130 --> 00:19:02,660
- Ji Hyo?
- We have Ji Hyo and Sang Ho.

551
00:19:02,660 --> 00:19:04,400
That's because...

552
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:06,310
Ji Hyo spends
most of her time in bed.

553
00:19:06,310 --> 00:19:07,840
Who should go up from our team?

554
00:19:08,370 --> 00:19:09,540
I think I'm going up again.

555
00:19:09,540 --> 00:19:12,230
(So Min's eyes stop at someone.)

556
00:19:12,230 --> 00:19:14,000
- Well...
- And Do Won.

557
00:19:14,610 --> 00:19:17,350
- Do Won and I should go up there.
- You should go up.

558
00:19:17,470 --> 00:19:19,440
Do you mind going up?

559
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:20,550
- No.
- Let's do that.

560
00:19:20,550 --> 00:19:21,620
Actually...

561
00:19:21,620 --> 00:19:24,590
Suk Jin, why do you feel
uncomfortable around Do Won?

562
00:19:25,010 --> 00:19:26,520
I'm not uncomfortable.

563
00:19:26,520 --> 00:19:28,480
- It's so obvious.
- That's not true.

564
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:31,160
- You sound polite.
- He's a lot younger than you.

565
00:19:31,160 --> 00:19:33,130
- He is younger than me.
- He's way younger.

566
00:19:33,130 --> 00:19:34,520
I'm a big fan.

567
00:19:34,520 --> 00:19:36,900
I'm being respectful as a fan.

568
00:19:36,900 --> 00:19:38,490
Do Won, get up.

569
00:19:39,570 --> 00:19:40,660
Stand up.

570
00:19:40,660 --> 00:19:43,610
(He works up the nerve
and calls Do Won's name.)

571
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:45,730
What if we win again?

572
00:19:45,730 --> 00:19:47,670
I'm sure we will win this time.

573
00:19:47,770 --> 00:19:50,380
I'm nervous
because people in there sound busy.

574
00:19:50,820 --> 00:19:52,510
- They're busy doing something.
- They're in a rush.

575
00:19:52,510 --> 00:19:54,120
- They're clattering.
- They're busy.

576
00:19:54,120 --> 00:19:55,740
Please show us the result.

577
00:19:55,740 --> 00:19:57,560
I didn't see this coming.

578
00:19:57,560 --> 00:19:58,980
Move the conveyor. One.

579
00:19:58,980 --> 00:20:00,660
- I'm not nervous at all.
- Two.

580
00:20:00,660 --> 00:20:01,860
(Sang Ho and Ji Hyo are sure
they will win.)

581
00:20:01,890 --> 00:20:02,920
(Who are the winners?)

582
00:20:02,920 --> 00:20:03,990
Three.

583
00:20:04,600 --> 00:20:05,830
Okay!

584
00:20:05,830 --> 00:20:07,600
(Surprisingly,
Suk Jin and Do Won win.)

585
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:09,600
- We won.
- Hey, we won.

586
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:10,690
Really?

587
00:20:10,690 --> 00:20:12,400
- What's going on?
- We won.

588
00:20:12,570 --> 00:20:13,660
- Seriously?
- Seriously?

589
00:20:13,660 --> 00:20:15,070
- Seriously?
- Who would beat Sang Ho?

590
00:20:15,810 --> 00:20:18,110
- My gosh.
- That doesn't make sense.

591
00:20:19,310 --> 00:20:20,880
We have Sang Ho here.

592
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:24,150
(Ji Hyo and Sang Ho come out
after getting the penalty.)

593
00:20:24,150 --> 00:20:25,670
Come over here.

594
00:20:25,670 --> 00:20:27,410
(Behind the cute idiot is...)

595
00:20:27,510 --> 00:20:29,620
- What a surprise! That's right.
- Goodness.

596
00:20:29,980 --> 00:20:32,250
- Gosh, Sang Ho.
- You surprised me.

597
00:20:32,250 --> 00:20:35,130
(He looks good in this makeup.)

598
00:20:35,130 --> 00:20:36,630
(What a surprise!)

599
00:20:36,920 --> 00:20:39,220
- It looks good on him.
- That really surprised me.

600
00:20:39,220 --> 00:20:40,630
- Oh, my.
- You're so cute.

601
00:20:40,630 --> 00:20:42,600
- It looks so good on him.
- He's so cute.

602
00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:43,760
That really surprised me.

603
00:20:43,960 --> 00:20:45,800
- It suits him.
- Sang Ho is so funny.

604
00:20:45,800 --> 00:20:48,370
- He's so cute.
- He's so funny.

605
00:20:48,370 --> 00:20:50,610
(Sang Ho looks good in everything
for no reason.)

606
00:20:50,610 --> 00:20:53,240
He looks like he could have
a younger sister like her.

607
00:20:53,810 --> 00:20:55,050
- Oh, my.
- I saw someone like that.

608
00:20:55,050 --> 00:20:56,080
Jae Suk!

609
00:20:56,470 --> 00:20:57,820
He looks like the character from
"Dr. Slump".

610
00:20:58,320 --> 00:20:59,980
- He looks like her 50 years later.
- Arale.

611
00:20:59,980 --> 00:21:01,820
- 50 years later.
- But...

612
00:21:02,120 --> 00:21:04,010
These two were ranked higher.

613
00:21:04,010 --> 00:21:05,320
That's incredible.

614
00:21:05,320 --> 00:21:06,360
- Who is it?
- I'm so curious.

615
00:21:06,360 --> 00:21:07,420
- I really am.
- I'll reveal it now.

616
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:08,630
Who's in first place?

617
00:21:08,890 --> 00:21:10,690
- Kwak Do Won?
- Really?

618
00:21:10,690 --> 00:21:11,950
Kwak Do Won is in first place?

619
00:21:11,950 --> 00:21:13,160
I'm in second place?

620
00:21:13,160 --> 00:21:14,990
(Haha can't accept that he's in
2nd place either.)

621
00:21:14,990 --> 00:21:17,100
There were various reasons as to why
Do Won came in first place,

622
00:21:17,100 --> 00:21:19,460
but one of them was because he looks
like he might have athlete's foot.

623
00:21:19,460 --> 00:21:20,660
(He looks like he might have
athlete's foot.)

624
00:21:21,140 --> 00:21:22,700
- I have it.
- Why would they say that?

625
00:21:23,110 --> 00:21:24,500
What do you mean? I have it.

626
00:21:25,230 --> 00:21:28,000
- He admitted his athlete's foot.
- This is surprising.

627
00:21:29,150 --> 00:21:30,580
This is the fourth question.

628
00:21:30,580 --> 00:21:31,580
(Revealing the second question with
the keyword "foreigner")

629
00:21:31,710 --> 00:21:33,210
The actor who's likely to succeed
if they went to Hollywood.

630
00:21:33,210 --> 00:21:34,590
- I knew it.
- I knew it.

631
00:21:34,590 --> 00:21:36,120
See? I told you.

632
00:21:36,120 --> 00:21:37,320
We're in trouble.

633
00:21:37,320 --> 00:21:40,750
We showed foreigners your photos
from photoshoots and commercials.

634
00:21:40,790 --> 00:21:42,750
We showed them these photographs.

635
00:21:42,920 --> 00:21:43,920
Let's see.

636
00:21:45,420 --> 00:21:46,720
- Who are these people?
- Hold on.

637
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:47,960
Sang Ho. Sang Ho could go.

638
00:21:47,960 --> 00:21:49,300
- Look at Do Won.
- I...

639
00:21:49,300 --> 00:21:51,040
Who is that? Hold on. Who is that?

640
00:21:51,040 --> 00:21:52,930
- Ji Hyo looks great too.
- She's a strong contender.

641
00:21:52,930 --> 00:21:54,960
Ji Hyo's photograph is great.

642
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:58,580
I looked at Ji Hyo's photograph and
then at her, and it surprised me.

643
00:21:59,040 --> 00:22:00,810
I was really surprised.

644
00:22:01,310 --> 00:22:03,120
- Why?
- I think... Hold on.

645
00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:04,350
Who is that girl?

646
00:22:04,740 --> 00:22:06,320
- Is that So Min?
- Is it?

647
00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:07,320
I look like that with makeup on.

648
00:22:07,320 --> 00:22:09,210
Why did you use a photo application
instead of doing a photoshoot?

649
00:22:09,210 --> 00:22:12,120
I didn't.
I look like that with makeup on.

650
00:22:12,120 --> 00:22:13,720
They photoshopped her chin.

651
00:22:13,720 --> 00:22:15,220
Do you think they might've
chosen me?

652
00:22:15,220 --> 00:22:16,660
- I don't think so.
- I doubt it.

653
00:22:16,660 --> 00:22:18,220
Do you think they might've
chosen me?

654
00:22:18,220 --> 00:22:19,760
(Everyone is in unison when they say
it's not him.)

655
00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:21,130
You're not on the list.

656
00:22:21,130 --> 00:22:22,300
- You...
- Why not?

657
00:22:22,300 --> 00:22:23,930
- Hey.
- There's no way.

658
00:22:23,930 --> 00:22:25,400
- That picture...
- Why can't it be me?

659
00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:26,730
That picture isn't good.

660
00:22:26,730 --> 00:22:29,110
That picture makes you look like
an insurance broker.

661
00:22:29,110 --> 00:22:30,200
- An insurance broker?
- An insurance broker?

662
00:22:30,200 --> 00:22:31,230
- You do.
- The employee of the year.

663
00:22:31,230 --> 00:22:32,310
If I'm being honest.

664
00:22:32,810 --> 00:22:34,880
Or a candidate in a local election.

665
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:36,670
- Who will be chosen in our team?
- Suk Jin...

666
00:22:36,670 --> 00:22:38,210
I think it could be Dae Myeung.

667
00:22:38,210 --> 00:22:39,270
- Or Kwang Soo?
- I think...

668
00:22:39,270 --> 00:22:40,480
it's Kwang Soo and Sang Ho.

669
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:42,150
- Kwang Soo?
- He's a good choice.

670
00:22:42,150 --> 00:22:43,950
- Kwang Soo...
- Because...

671
00:22:44,010 --> 00:22:45,410
he looks like an actor.

672
00:22:45,410 --> 00:22:46,630
- Okay. Kwang Soo.
- Let's go with Kwang Soo.

673
00:22:46,630 --> 00:22:48,130
- Should I go up?
- Yes, you should.

674
00:22:48,130 --> 00:22:49,520
We'll go with Jong Kook and Ji Hyo.

675
00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:50,800
- I feel like I'm going to my spot.
- Kwang Soo...

676
00:22:50,800 --> 00:22:53,690
Kwang Soo is quite popular
among foreigners.

677
00:22:53,870 --> 00:22:55,370
Okay. Let's see the results.

678
00:22:55,420 --> 00:22:56,990
They lost. They're busy over there.

679
00:22:57,400 --> 00:22:59,140
- They're busy over there.
- It's really busy back there.

680
00:22:59,140 --> 00:23:00,140
- I hear something.
- What is it?

681
00:23:00,140 --> 00:23:01,200
One.

682
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:02,570
(This question is a matter of pride
for celebrities.)

683
00:23:02,810 --> 00:23:03,840
Two.

684
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:05,410
(Kwang Soo and Sang Ho
have a strong presence.)

685
00:23:05,410 --> 00:23:06,410
Three.

686
00:23:06,410 --> 00:23:07,700
(Ji Hyo and Jong Kook
have an overwhelming visual.)

687
00:23:09,110 --> 00:23:10,240
- Okay.
- We lost.

688
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:12,740
(Jong Kook and Ji Hyo win!)

689
00:23:13,180 --> 00:23:15,210
- Ji Hyo was too strong.
- I knew we'd win.

690
00:23:15,210 --> 00:23:17,510
- Thank goodness.
- It was Ji Hyo and Jong Kook.

691
00:23:17,510 --> 00:23:19,160
Isn't this Sang Ho's special?

692
00:23:19,160 --> 00:23:20,480
I know, he got so many penalties.

693
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:22,800
I know. This is Kim Sang Ho's game.

694
00:23:22,900 --> 00:23:24,190
Please come out.

695
00:23:24,520 --> 00:23:25,900
Oh, my. What is this?

696
00:23:26,990 --> 00:23:28,630
They got it done.

697
00:23:28,830 --> 00:23:30,140
Is that it?

698
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:31,400
That's the penalty.

699
00:23:31,400 --> 00:23:32,870
- How cute.
- How cute.

700
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:35,460
- Sang Ho is so cute.
- I was wondering what it was.

701
00:23:35,460 --> 00:23:37,580
- Sang Ho.
- How cute.

702
00:23:38,140 --> 00:23:40,470
Kwang Soo, you don't look
as funny today.

703
00:23:40,470 --> 00:23:41,910
- Kwang Soo.
- You always looked the funniest.

704
00:23:41,910 --> 00:23:43,510
- You don't stand out today.
- You don't.

705
00:23:43,510 --> 00:23:44,940
You don't catch our eyes.

706
00:23:44,940 --> 00:23:46,590
- Do I look that funny?
- Yes, you do.

707
00:23:46,850 --> 00:23:47,980
You look so cute.

708
00:23:47,980 --> 00:23:49,450
Come down.

709
00:23:49,590 --> 00:23:52,010
I'll reveal the results.
It's very interesting.

710
00:23:52,010 --> 00:23:53,020
- Okay.
- Is it?

711
00:23:53,330 --> 00:23:54,390
What is this?

712
00:23:54,390 --> 00:23:56,130
- So Min's in first place?
- So Min's in first place?

713
00:23:56,130 --> 00:23:57,190
- In second is Kim Jong Kook.
- It was me?

714
00:23:57,190 --> 00:23:58,720
- See? I told you.
- I'm in fourth place?

715
00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:00,870
With Ji Hyo there too. I was right.

716
00:24:00,870 --> 00:24:02,400
- So Min would succeed too.
- I'm in last place?

717
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:04,070
I should go.

718
00:24:04,300 --> 00:24:05,600
I'm in last place?

719
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:06,610
(I'm in last place?)

720
00:24:06,610 --> 00:24:08,040
Kwang Soo was in last place.

721
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:10,770
They must've chosen without
considering popularity.

722
00:24:10,770 --> 00:24:12,000
What are you doing now?

723
00:24:12,310 --> 00:24:13,310
Yang Se Chan...

724
00:24:13,310 --> 00:24:15,110
- beat me.
- Se Chan is in sixth place.

725
00:24:15,110 --> 00:24:16,150
What happened?

726
00:24:16,510 --> 00:24:18,010
I'm okay with coming in last place,

727
00:24:18,010 --> 00:24:19,510
but I'm so mad
that Jae Suk beat me.

728
00:24:19,510 --> 00:24:21,410
- My gosh, Kwang Soo...
- Seriously.

729
00:24:21,410 --> 00:24:23,010
I guess Kwang Soo's picture
didn't have any appeal.

730
00:24:23,010 --> 00:24:25,950
I guess he's in last place. He must
not be appealing to foreigners.

731
00:24:26,750 --> 00:24:29,520
So the result is out.

732
00:24:29,520 --> 00:24:32,020
- I wonder how it came out?
- This is what's important.

733
00:24:32,250 --> 00:24:34,630
The person who won the most is...

734
00:24:35,100 --> 00:24:37,400
Kwak Do Won, who won all five times.

735
00:24:37,400 --> 00:24:38,490
(Kwak Do Won won all 5 times.)

736
00:24:38,490 --> 00:24:40,200
- Really?
- You won every time?

737
00:24:40,200 --> 00:24:41,660
He won five times?

738
00:24:41,870 --> 00:24:44,540
I'll tell you what kind of hints
Do Won can get.

739
00:24:44,730 --> 00:24:46,350
Out of the 10 of you,

740
00:24:46,350 --> 00:24:48,380
2 of you are police officers,
and 2 of you are criminals.

741
00:24:48,380 --> 00:24:52,170
We can choose two people who aren't
police officers at random...

742
00:24:52,410 --> 00:24:54,150
- and tell you who they are.
- Really?

743
00:24:54,150 --> 00:24:56,180
In other words, they are
either a citizen or a criminal.

744
00:24:56,410 --> 00:24:59,830
Or we can tell you two people
who aren't criminals.

745
00:24:59,830 --> 00:25:02,060
Then those two will be either
a police officer or a citizen.

746
00:25:02,680 --> 00:25:05,950
You can come up and whisper
which one you want to know.

747
00:25:05,950 --> 00:25:07,960
If you ask me up here,
I'll tell you.

748
00:25:07,960 --> 00:25:10,300
What is he saying?
I don't understand.

749
00:25:10,300 --> 00:25:11,690
- He sounds like a police officer.
- I don't understand.

750
00:25:11,690 --> 00:25:13,310
- He sounds like a real cop.
- It's hard, right?

751
00:25:13,410 --> 00:25:15,660
Yes, I don't understand.

752
00:25:15,700 --> 00:25:17,700
- Even if...
- He seems like a police officer.

753
00:25:17,700 --> 00:25:20,410
- Even if I study, I don't get it.
- He seems like a police officer.

754
00:25:20,410 --> 00:25:21,580
(His question will differ depending
on his identity.)

755
00:25:21,580 --> 00:25:23,770
(What is the question that
Do Won asked?)

756
00:25:23,770 --> 00:25:25,150
Tell me the two
that aren't criminals.

757
00:25:25,150 --> 00:25:26,150
(Tell me the two
that aren't criminals.)

758
00:25:26,620 --> 00:25:28,510
- That was too loud.
- You're supposed to whisper.

759
00:25:28,510 --> 00:25:30,390
- We can hear it all.
- You're supposed to whisper.

760
00:25:30,390 --> 00:25:31,390
(He asked a question that
only a citizen would want to know.)

761
00:25:31,390 --> 00:25:33,750
(Then he asked another question
that is inaudible.)

762
00:25:33,750 --> 00:25:35,790
This is the answer to your question.

763
00:25:37,250 --> 00:25:38,860
(If it was the same as
his initial question,)

764
00:25:38,860 --> 00:25:41,690
You have to make sure no one sees
your notebook.

765
00:25:41,690 --> 00:25:44,400
(then Do Won is either
a citizen or a police officer.)

766
00:25:44,760 --> 00:25:47,960
If that was a fake,
then I acknowledge him.

767
00:25:48,110 --> 00:25:49,810
- We're friends.
- I know you are.

768
00:25:49,810 --> 00:25:53,150
(What question did Do Won
ask the production crew?)

769
00:25:54,310 --> 00:25:56,320
Why don't we have more chairs?

770
00:25:56,350 --> 00:25:57,670
What is this?

771
00:25:58,440 --> 00:26:00,050
What is "Running Cinema"?

772
00:26:00,090 --> 00:26:01,850
The second mission is...

773
00:26:02,210 --> 00:26:04,410
a game where you must all
work together.

774
00:26:04,410 --> 00:26:06,830
It's Speak With Your Actions:
Cinema Nightmare.

775
00:26:07,390 --> 00:26:08,560
I like things like this.

776
00:26:08,680 --> 00:26:10,560
- The 10 of you are in 1 team.
- What's this?

777
00:26:10,560 --> 00:26:12,420
If you answer more than
3 of the 5 questions,

778
00:26:12,420 --> 00:26:14,870
we will give you two hints
that will help the citizens.

779
00:26:15,020 --> 00:26:16,220
If you answer two questions right,

780
00:26:16,220 --> 00:26:18,300
the citizens and the criminals
will get one hint each.

781
00:26:18,300 --> 00:26:22,140
If you only get 1 question right,
the criminals will get 2 hints.

782
00:26:22,310 --> 00:26:25,200
I think Sang Ho might curse
while playing this game.

783
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:28,310
No, I won't.
It means the criminals will try...

784
00:26:28,410 --> 00:26:29,620
to prevent us from getting...

785
00:26:29,620 --> 00:26:30,940
- the right answers.
- That's right.

786
00:26:30,940 --> 00:26:32,980
I understood it. See? I get it.

787
00:26:33,010 --> 00:26:35,090
You understood it too quickly.
That's suspicious.

788
00:26:35,210 --> 00:26:36,860
It's suspicious that
you understood it already.

789
00:26:36,860 --> 00:26:38,210
As if he already knew the rules.

790
00:26:38,210 --> 00:26:40,720
As if one of our writers
told you the rules in advance.

791
00:26:40,830 --> 00:26:42,830
This is how the game will proceed.

792
00:26:43,130 --> 00:26:45,160
Five representatives will step up
for each round,

793
00:26:45,160 --> 00:26:46,630
and there is a 100-second
time limit.

794
00:26:46,630 --> 00:26:50,840
We're going to show the first person
a summary of a movie.

795
00:26:50,840 --> 00:26:53,040
They must explain it with
their bodies and pass it along.

796
00:26:53,040 --> 00:26:54,410
This is really hard.

797
00:26:54,410 --> 00:26:55,410
This is hard.

798
00:26:55,410 --> 00:26:57,770
If the last person gets the title
of the movie right, you get a point.

799
00:26:57,770 --> 00:26:59,410
- How are we supposed to do this?
- This is too hard.

800
00:26:59,410 --> 00:27:01,380
- This is hard.
- This is hard.

801
00:27:01,380 --> 00:27:02,880
The actors must get it right.

802
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:04,910
- That's right.
- I'm sure it'll be famous lines.

803
00:27:04,910 --> 00:27:06,320
It's not a famous line.
It's a summary of the movie.

804
00:27:06,320 --> 00:27:07,410
It's a summary?

805
00:27:07,510 --> 00:27:10,360
When did he mention that
it was a famous line?

806
00:27:10,590 --> 00:27:11,980
He didn't say anything about
a famous line.

807
00:27:11,980 --> 00:27:13,860
Are you hearing things now?

808
00:27:13,920 --> 00:27:15,920
- He's trying his best.
- He is.

809
00:27:15,920 --> 00:27:17,250
He's just trying to do his job.

810
00:27:17,250 --> 00:27:18,900
Let's choose someone
who's good at it.

811
00:27:18,900 --> 00:27:20,630
Let's have the actors go.

812
00:27:20,630 --> 00:27:22,190
We can make a team that's filled
with good players.

813
00:27:22,190 --> 00:27:23,460
- Let's do that.
- Then we can see who gets it wrong.

814
00:27:23,460 --> 00:27:24,800
- That's right.
- Also...

815
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:26,700
- I want Do Won to go.
- So Min?

816
00:27:26,700 --> 00:27:28,000
- Do Won.
- I want to see him.

817
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:29,910
We need to include our members.

818
00:27:29,910 --> 00:27:32,410
We need to include someone
who's good.

819
00:27:32,410 --> 00:27:33,470
Someone who's good. Who's good?

820
00:27:33,470 --> 00:27:34,610
- Should I go in?
- Jae Suk.

821
00:27:34,610 --> 00:27:36,000
- Jae Suk.
- You should stay out of it.

822
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:37,770
- You need to stay out of it.
- You can try later.

823
00:27:37,770 --> 00:27:39,410
(The person who's afraid of games
can go later.)

824
00:27:39,410 --> 00:27:41,790
All of our aces are up.

825
00:27:41,790 --> 00:27:44,160
Ready, set,

826
00:27:44,160 --> 00:27:45,510
(What's the first movie the ace team
will do?)

827
00:27:45,510 --> 00:27:46,520
go.

828
00:27:46,520 --> 00:27:47,980
(They must undergo 7 trials
in the underworld to be reborn.)

829
00:27:47,980 --> 00:27:49,750
Is this the movie?

830
00:27:50,600 --> 00:27:52,330
This is hard.

831
00:27:52,950 --> 00:27:54,520
How would you explain it?

832
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:56,840
- Does it start once I turn around?
- Yes.

833
00:27:57,600 --> 00:27:59,260
- The clock started.
- Did it?

834
00:27:59,300 --> 00:28:01,000
This is hard to explain.

835
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:02,700
- It's hard.
- It's really hard.

836
00:28:03,040 --> 00:28:04,040
Okay.

837
00:28:04,040 --> 00:28:06,310
(They must undergo 7 trials in the
underworld to be reborn.)

838
00:28:06,310 --> 00:28:07,310
This is good.

839
00:28:07,310 --> 00:28:08,470
(You die and go to the underworld.)

840
00:28:08,470 --> 00:28:10,620
This is good.
I'm sure he can figure it out.

841
00:28:10,620 --> 00:28:11,620
(It's a good start.)

842
00:28:12,550 --> 00:28:14,150
- This is Grim Reaper.
- I think he'll get it.

843
00:28:14,150 --> 00:28:16,050
You only have 100 seconds.
That's not a lot.

844
00:28:16,050 --> 00:28:17,680
That's it. You can go now.

845
00:28:17,680 --> 00:28:19,090
(They only have 100 seconds.
He quickly explains it to Sang Ho.)

846
00:28:19,860 --> 00:28:21,160
(You die.)

847
00:28:21,160 --> 00:28:22,250
This is good.

848
00:28:22,250 --> 00:28:23,520
(You go to the skies.)

849
00:28:24,450 --> 00:28:25,490
(Sang Ho explains it
just as Jong Kook did.)

850
00:28:25,490 --> 00:28:26,630
Sang Ho knows the answer.

851
00:28:26,630 --> 00:28:29,220
He knows. He's doing good.

852
00:28:29,220 --> 00:28:30,400
(You get judged.)

853
00:28:30,400 --> 00:28:31,490
- They're doing good.
- This is good.

854
00:28:31,490 --> 00:28:33,230
- He got it.
- He explained it well.

855
00:28:33,410 --> 00:28:34,700
He got it.

856
00:28:34,810 --> 00:28:35,960
Good.

857
00:28:35,960 --> 00:28:37,000
Okay.

858
00:28:37,230 --> 00:28:38,500
Go. You only have 100 seconds.

859
00:28:38,500 --> 00:28:40,200
- He has to know this.
- Come on.

860
00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:43,350
I think they'll get it.
But sometimes you forget the title.

861
00:28:45,880 --> 00:28:48,890
(He explains it with the same
movements to Do Won.)

862
00:28:48,890 --> 00:28:50,320
Oh, my.

863
00:28:50,320 --> 00:28:52,010
- I don't think he knows.
- This is weird.

864
00:28:52,320 --> 00:28:54,480
He has to explain dying more.

865
00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:55,980
(It's the same explanation,
but he doesn't seem to know.)

866
00:28:55,980 --> 00:28:57,520
My gosh. This is driving me crazy.

867
00:28:57,520 --> 00:28:58,900
- How much time is left?
- We don't have time.

868
00:28:58,900 --> 00:29:00,800
- He doesn't know?
- This is...

869
00:29:01,020 --> 00:29:02,160
You should do a better job.

870
00:29:02,160 --> 00:29:05,370
Doesn't Do Won know?
It was exactly the same.

871
00:29:05,370 --> 00:29:07,110
- How can he not know?
- He just needs to copy it.

872
00:29:07,110 --> 00:29:09,110
(Will Do Won explain it correctly
to So Min?)

873
00:29:09,570 --> 00:29:11,110
- Go ahead.
- The sky?

874
00:29:11,110 --> 00:29:12,310
(He's pointing at the sky?)

875
00:29:12,310 --> 00:29:14,670
- He's acting weird.
- We need to be quiet.

876
00:29:14,700 --> 00:29:18,410
(The movements were, "After you die,
you go to the underworld".)

877
00:29:18,670 --> 00:29:20,440
- Go ahead.
- The sky?

878
00:29:21,480 --> 00:29:23,750
- He's acting weird.
- That comes later.

879
00:29:23,750 --> 00:29:25,120
That's right.

880
00:29:25,510 --> 00:29:28,590
(He's acting a bit weird.)

881
00:29:28,590 --> 00:29:31,020
- He's acting weird.
- We need to be quiet.

882
00:29:31,950 --> 00:29:34,490
They died. They died in the sky.

883
00:29:34,490 --> 00:29:35,660
The order is off.

884
00:29:35,660 --> 00:29:36,660
(It's time to portray the judgment.)

885
00:29:36,660 --> 00:29:37,870
"You punks!"

886
00:29:39,100 --> 00:29:40,460
("You punks!")

887
00:29:40,460 --> 00:29:42,230
"What are you doing, you punks?"

888
00:29:42,810 --> 00:29:44,810
(She's immersed.)

889
00:29:45,670 --> 00:29:46,850
What's wrong with So Min?

890
00:29:47,500 --> 00:29:48,880
They died in the sky.

891
00:29:49,610 --> 00:29:51,150
They hold on to this and go...

892
00:29:51,470 --> 00:29:52,470
(She turns on her own dubbing.)

893
00:29:52,470 --> 00:29:54,510
- "You punks."
- What's she doing?

894
00:29:55,790 --> 00:29:57,210
(He's judging them over here.)

895
00:29:57,210 --> 00:29:59,510
(She's shooting them over here.)

896
00:29:59,510 --> 00:30:01,060
Oh, my.

897
00:30:01,060 --> 00:30:02,950
Gosh. They're acting weird.

898
00:30:02,950 --> 00:30:04,830
- Jeon So Min.
- "You punks!"

899
00:30:05,190 --> 00:30:07,220
- "You punks."
- Jeon So Min.

900
00:30:07,420 --> 00:30:08,420
- "You punks."
- Jeon So Min.

901
00:30:08,420 --> 00:30:10,040
- So Min.
- This is how So Min is.

902
00:30:10,040 --> 00:30:11,040
What is this?

903
00:30:11,040 --> 00:30:13,610
- In the sky.
- You have 10 seconds left.

904
00:30:14,340 --> 00:30:15,370
Kill.

905
00:30:15,730 --> 00:30:17,670
(Oh, "Along with the Gods".)

906
00:30:17,670 --> 00:30:18,910
Oh, "Along with the Gods".

907
00:30:18,910 --> 00:30:23,620
("Along with the Gods" is correct.)

908
00:30:24,770 --> 00:30:26,120
- You did great, Jong Kook.
- You surprised me.

909
00:30:26,150 --> 00:30:27,320
Good one.

910
00:30:27,390 --> 00:30:29,290
- I honestly had no idea.
- How did you know?

911
00:30:30,210 --> 00:30:32,010
What was it though?

912
00:30:32,250 --> 00:30:33,630
- "Along with the Gods".
- Really?

913
00:30:34,420 --> 00:30:36,360
- No way.
- Amazing.

914
00:30:36,360 --> 00:30:37,750
I didn't know what it was either.

915
00:30:37,750 --> 00:30:39,520
- Really?
- I just did what you did.

916
00:30:39,520 --> 00:30:40,800
I thought you understood!

917
00:30:40,800 --> 00:30:41,870
- You did it so well though.
- Unbelievable.

918
00:30:41,870 --> 00:30:44,040
- We thought you knew.
- It seemed that way.

919
00:30:44,040 --> 00:30:46,140
- Really?
- It's crucial to have a good start.

920
00:30:46,340 --> 00:30:47,870
Jong Kook did a good job
explaining it.

921
00:30:47,870 --> 00:30:49,730
(A nice start and a perfect ending)

922
00:30:49,730 --> 00:30:51,140
I think Suk Jin should participate.

923
00:30:51,140 --> 00:30:52,470
- Suk Jin?
- Yes, I agree.

924
00:30:52,470 --> 00:30:54,580
- We need to filter people out.
- We know now.

925
00:30:54,580 --> 00:30:56,740
- We have a basic idea.
- Dae Myeung, you can answer.

926
00:30:57,080 --> 00:30:58,880
- I don't know if I can do this.
- You know a lot of movies.

927
00:30:58,880 --> 00:31:00,940
You aren't allowed
to make any noises from now on.

928
00:31:00,940 --> 00:31:02,050
- Sure.
- Got it.

929
00:31:02,050 --> 00:31:04,250
It's over for me
if I don't do a good job.

930
00:31:04,250 --> 00:31:05,560
- Exactly.
- So do your best.

931
00:31:05,560 --> 00:31:07,560
- I'm watching you.
- Okay. You can count on me.

932
00:31:07,560 --> 00:31:09,290
Ready, set, go.

933
00:31:09,860 --> 00:31:11,800
(The story of an expert face reader
who tries to prevent a revolt)

934
00:31:11,800 --> 00:31:13,100
That's a difficult one.

935
00:31:13,100 --> 00:31:14,300
This is a hard one.

936
00:31:15,260 --> 00:31:16,660
It's too difficult.

937
00:31:16,660 --> 00:31:18,730
("The Face Reader")

938
00:31:18,730 --> 00:31:21,340
Think wisely, Kwang Soo.
This may be your last chance.

939
00:31:21,410 --> 00:31:22,870
How can one explain this?

940
00:31:23,270 --> 00:31:24,430
You can do it.

941
00:31:24,430 --> 00:31:26,540
(He starts off by making
a big fuss about it.)

942
00:31:26,540 --> 00:31:28,670
(The story of an expert face reader
who tries to prevent a revolt)

943
00:31:28,670 --> 00:31:30,440
- This is really difficult.
- What's he up to?

944
00:31:30,440 --> 00:31:31,740
Is that the best he can do?

945
00:31:34,050 --> 00:31:35,350
(He makes puzzling gestures
near his face.)

946
00:31:35,350 --> 00:31:36,680
- Wait, hold on.
- What?

947
00:31:36,790 --> 00:31:38,180
- What is that?
- Hold on a second.

948
00:31:39,450 --> 00:31:40,920
- What on earth is that?
- Hold on a second.

949
00:31:40,920 --> 00:31:42,160
What is that?

950
00:31:42,330 --> 00:31:43,900
(This and that)

951
00:31:43,900 --> 00:31:45,100
Hold on a second.

952
00:31:45,100 --> 00:31:46,990
Kwang Soo's done for.

953
00:31:46,990 --> 00:31:48,920
(I'm the King!)

954
00:31:49,870 --> 00:31:51,300
He's done for.

955
00:31:51,300 --> 00:31:53,340
- What is this?
- What are you doing?

956
00:31:53,340 --> 00:31:54,810
- Hey!
- Seriously?

957
00:31:55,540 --> 00:31:58,270
(He gives up explaining
what the movie is about.)

958
00:31:58,610 --> 00:32:00,110
- Kwang Soo!
- Let's move on.

959
00:32:00,110 --> 00:32:02,000
- What on earth are you doing?
- Hey.

960
00:32:02,170 --> 00:32:03,650
- What is this?
- What are you doing?

961
00:32:03,650 --> 00:32:05,350
(No one can understand
what he's doing.)

962
00:32:06,910 --> 00:32:08,650
(He confuses Sang Ho
with his slow-walking.)

963
00:32:08,650 --> 00:32:10,480
Why would you do that?

964
00:32:10,750 --> 00:32:11,790
- That...
- Hey!

965
00:32:12,180 --> 00:32:14,720
I don't know what that is
even though I'm aware of the answer.

966
00:32:14,790 --> 00:32:17,020
- He messed it all up.
- He's one of the criminals.

967
00:32:17,020 --> 00:32:18,220
- What on earth is that?
- You never know though.

968
00:32:18,220 --> 00:32:19,330
He messed it all up.

969
00:32:19,330 --> 00:32:20,870
(Just forget it.)

970
00:32:21,400 --> 00:32:23,690
- You!
- Sang Ho might've understood it.

971
00:32:23,760 --> 00:32:25,230
- You never know.
- He's a criminal.

972
00:32:26,040 --> 00:32:27,230
I'm clueless even though
I know the answer.

973
00:32:27,840 --> 00:32:30,970
(Sang Ho does
exactly what Kwang Soo did.)

974
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:34,080
- How can one guess anything?
- What is that?

975
00:32:34,080 --> 00:32:35,200
- This isn't nearly enough.
- I know.

976
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:37,080
- What on earth is that?
- Unbelievable.

977
00:32:38,380 --> 00:32:40,790
(The reason it's crucial to
have a good start)

978
00:32:40,910 --> 00:32:42,320
I think Sang Ho...

979
00:32:42,390 --> 00:32:43,750
- Do Won's next.
- I'm sure of it.

980
00:32:43,750 --> 00:32:45,710
Sang Ho doesn't know what it is.

981
00:32:45,710 --> 00:32:47,420
He only copied what he saw.

982
00:32:47,680 --> 00:32:49,750
Someone might catch on though...

983
00:32:49,790 --> 00:32:50,920
if they pinpoint what's crucial.

984
00:32:50,920 --> 00:32:52,330
(Someone might catch on
if they pinpoint what's crucial.)

985
00:32:54,260 --> 00:32:55,960
It's even weirder now.

986
00:32:56,960 --> 00:32:58,460
I know what the answer will be.

987
00:32:58,460 --> 00:32:59,640
I think I know too.

988
00:32:59,640 --> 00:33:00,660
(Face-palming and slow-walking)

989
00:33:01,760 --> 00:33:03,230
- I think I know what it is.
- What?

990
00:33:04,500 --> 00:33:08,170
(Suk Jin thinks he knows.)

991
00:33:08,500 --> 00:33:11,050
- It's gotten weirder.
- He doesn't know.

992
00:33:11,470 --> 00:33:12,650
He's clueless.

993
00:33:13,390 --> 00:33:15,090
This is weird.

994
00:33:17,590 --> 00:33:18,790
What on earth is this?

995
00:33:19,410 --> 00:33:21,090
- Time over.
- Is it...

996
00:33:21,090 --> 00:33:22,660
- What?
- That old movie.

997
00:33:22,660 --> 00:33:24,250
- What's the answer?
- It's enough to make a guess.

998
00:33:24,250 --> 00:33:26,900
- I think I know what it is.
- It's enough to guess the movie.

999
00:33:26,900 --> 00:33:30,190
(All they have to go on is
the face and slow-walking.)

1000
00:33:30,190 --> 00:33:31,930
- I think I know what it is.
- It's enough to guess the movie.

1001
00:33:31,930 --> 00:33:33,640
- "Face Off".
- That's what I thought too.

1002
00:33:33,730 --> 00:33:35,810
- Right?
- "The Mask".

1003
00:33:35,810 --> 00:33:38,000
- That's what you said too.
- Here's the answer.

1004
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:40,580
- What's the answer?
- "The Face Reader".

1005
00:33:40,850 --> 00:33:43,200
How does that explain
"The Face Reader"?

1006
00:33:43,270 --> 00:33:44,580
Remember the scene
with Lee Jung Jae?

1007
00:33:44,580 --> 00:33:46,620
- Yes, of course.
- He's walking up the stairs.

1008
00:33:46,620 --> 00:33:48,320
We only know what that scene is
because we're aware of the answer.

1009
00:33:48,320 --> 00:33:49,410
(He did a poor job
reenacting the scene.)

1010
00:33:50,060 --> 00:33:52,160
Forget it and just sit back down.

1011
00:33:52,410 --> 00:33:55,330
- Kwang Soo sure seems suspicious.
- I agree.

1012
00:33:55,420 --> 00:33:58,660
- He made it impossible to guess.
- It was too difficult.

1013
00:33:59,020 --> 00:34:01,220
Shouldn't we score a point
in this next round?

1014
00:34:01,330 --> 00:34:02,600
Yes, we should.

1015
00:34:02,600 --> 00:34:05,460
- So Min or Jong Kook then.
- Yes, So Min.

1016
00:34:05,460 --> 00:34:07,310
- Yes, us.
- I'm not a criminal.

1017
00:34:07,310 --> 00:34:12,610
- I'm not one either, actually.
- "Actually"?

1018
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:14,350
Why would you add "actually"
at the end?

1019
00:34:14,410 --> 00:34:16,850
- Hold on. Isn't that weird?
- It really isn't me.

1020
00:34:16,850 --> 00:34:19,540
- Actually?
- I get it though.

1021
00:34:19,540 --> 00:34:21,020
- You need to explain.
- No, wait.

1022
00:34:21,120 --> 00:34:22,920
- It just popped out.
- You're playing.

1023
00:34:22,920 --> 00:34:24,160
- Actually?
- It isn't me.

1024
00:34:24,160 --> 00:34:25,310
Am I suddenly being suspected?

1025
00:34:25,310 --> 00:34:27,250
He always makes it worse
for himself by talking too much.

1026
00:34:27,250 --> 00:34:28,660
- Actually?
- Whenever he plays a devious role,

1027
00:34:28,660 --> 00:34:30,620
he actively accuses other people.

1028
00:34:30,620 --> 00:34:32,000
- Right?
- That's so true.

1029
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:33,160
Okay, let's do this.

1030
00:34:33,160 --> 00:34:34,370
- It's not me.
- So how will it be?

1031
00:34:34,370 --> 00:34:35,920
Dae Myeung, you should play too.

1032
00:34:37,040 --> 00:34:39,500
(Do Won asks his manager
for something.)

1033
00:34:39,500 --> 00:34:41,040
- Get ready.
- Just one.

1034
00:34:41,270 --> 00:34:42,560
Did he bring it?

1035
00:34:45,040 --> 00:34:46,270
- Let me pass it along.
- What is it?

1036
00:34:46,940 --> 00:34:48,540
Do Won has a sore throat.

1037
00:34:48,540 --> 00:34:49,850
- Candy for his throat?
- Thank you.

1038
00:34:51,040 --> 00:34:52,620
- Can I get one too?
- No.

1039
00:34:53,810 --> 00:34:55,310
(He demands one as well.)

1040
00:34:55,310 --> 00:34:56,420
Why?

1041
00:34:56,420 --> 00:34:57,920
- This is his medicine, you know.
- I know.

1042
00:34:58,060 --> 00:34:59,660
Why would you take his medicine?

1043
00:34:59,810 --> 00:35:01,120
I don't mind.

1044
00:35:01,120 --> 00:35:02,960
- Why take his medicine?
- I hated his tone.

1045
00:35:02,960 --> 00:35:04,920
- He needs it for his throat.
- Do Won...

1046
00:35:05,060 --> 00:35:06,500
has a sore throat.

1047
00:35:06,730 --> 00:35:08,620
- Are you kidding me?
- His manager passed it along.

1048
00:35:08,620 --> 00:35:10,640
- But...
- You don't even talk that much.

1049
00:35:10,640 --> 00:35:12,730
- Don't take it!
- It won't hurt though, right?

1050
00:35:12,730 --> 00:35:13,810
Just don't.

1051
00:35:15,060 --> 00:35:16,830
(He isn't that comfortable
around Do Won but...)

1052
00:35:16,830 --> 00:35:19,330
He never passes up on a chance
to eat things.

1053
00:35:19,640 --> 00:35:21,000
I'll explain what I read, okay?

1054
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:23,270
- The five of us will compete.
- Yes, let's.

1055
00:35:23,640 --> 00:35:24,750
Go!

1056
00:35:24,750 --> 00:35:26,750
(Which sentence will Do Won
have to explain?)

1057
00:35:26,750 --> 00:35:27,850
It's not easy.

1058
00:35:28,080 --> 00:35:29,890
See? This isn't easy at all.

1059
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:32,790
Hold on. I don't think
I know that movie.

1060
00:35:32,920 --> 00:35:34,120
Which movie is that?

1061
00:35:34,480 --> 00:35:36,190
Please begin. The clock is ticking.

1062
00:35:36,420 --> 00:35:37,620
Do it!

1063
00:35:38,620 --> 00:35:39,890
- He's doing great.
- Who is that?

1064
00:35:39,890 --> 00:35:41,670
- Is that Sang Ho?
- And Do Won.

1065
00:35:41,670 --> 00:35:42,870
(He describes a high school girl.)

1066
00:35:42,870 --> 00:35:44,290
- Sang Ho's watching.
- He might swear soon.

1067
00:35:45,560 --> 00:35:47,000
It might throw Sang Ho off though.

1068
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:48,310
My gosh.

1069
00:35:48,310 --> 00:35:51,170
(He shows off his cute side.)

1070
00:35:51,640 --> 00:35:52,730
What is it?

1071
00:35:52,730 --> 00:35:55,350
(Lovely Do Won)

1072
00:35:55,350 --> 00:35:57,020
- Nice.
- You look so sweet.

1073
00:35:57,350 --> 00:36:00,640
(He shows off his sweet side
with gentle steps.)

1074
00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:02,190
- Is it Sang Ho now?
- No.

1075
00:36:02,190 --> 00:36:03,890
- Do Won's being cute.
- Really?

1076
00:36:04,520 --> 00:36:05,850
The way he's describing it...

1077
00:36:05,980 --> 00:36:07,980
- Is he doing a good job?
- Yes, he's being sweet.

1078
00:36:08,920 --> 00:36:10,230
Doesn't he look like Winnie the Pooh
in the orange shirt?

1079
00:36:10,230 --> 00:36:11,250
He does.

1080
00:36:12,190 --> 00:36:13,960
He looks like a teddy bear.

1081
00:36:13,960 --> 00:36:18,370
(Teddy Bear Do Won needs
to go back 25 years.)

1082
00:36:19,140 --> 00:36:20,370
25 years!

1083
00:36:21,710 --> 00:36:24,270
(The pent-up frustration
makes him roar like a bear.)

1084
00:36:24,270 --> 00:36:25,600
- What?
- What is it?

1085
00:36:25,600 --> 00:36:27,140
- What was it?
- What's going on?

1086
00:36:27,250 --> 00:36:28,540
- What?
- Seriously?

1087
00:36:29,210 --> 00:36:30,580
Do it again, will you?

1088
00:36:30,580 --> 00:36:32,250
- What was that?
- Show us!

1089
00:36:32,770 --> 00:36:34,020
- What did he do?
- He was amazing.

1090
00:36:34,310 --> 00:36:35,620
He talked during the game though.

1091
00:36:35,750 --> 00:36:37,480
The movie was "Sunny".

1092
00:36:37,480 --> 00:36:39,190
(They fail Round 3 because
Do Won gave a verbal hint.)

1093
00:36:39,190 --> 00:36:41,460
- It was weird though.
- It's too difficult to explain.

1094
00:36:41,690 --> 00:36:44,750
- We're going super easy on you.
- This...

1095
00:36:44,790 --> 00:36:48,390
It's too hard to explain
just that one sentence.

1096
00:36:48,390 --> 00:36:49,730
You're all doing a good job though.

1097
00:36:49,920 --> 00:36:51,830
- What do you mean?
- Seriously?

1098
00:36:51,960 --> 00:36:53,640
You're all doing a good job though.

1099
00:36:53,640 --> 00:36:54,830
Then we would've gotten
more than one right.

1100
00:36:54,830 --> 00:36:56,410
- What do you mean we're doing well?
- Are you kidding me?

1101
00:36:56,410 --> 00:36:57,710
What exactly are we doing well?

1102
00:36:57,710 --> 00:36:59,230
What's with that arrogant tone?

1103
00:36:59,230 --> 00:37:00,600
How are we doing a good job?

1104
00:37:00,600 --> 00:37:03,040
- We're getting all of them wrong.
- How are we doing a good job?

1105
00:37:03,040 --> 00:37:04,940
We're doing good
only from your standpoint...

1106
00:37:05,040 --> 00:37:06,140
because we're getting them wrong.

1107
00:37:06,620 --> 00:37:07,710
Get ready...

1108
00:37:07,710 --> 00:37:08,940
(After they calm down,
Round 4 begins.)

1109
00:37:09,920 --> 00:37:11,420
Ready, set, go.

1110
00:37:11,420 --> 00:37:13,020
(They guessed 1 correct,
and now they have 2 chances left.)

1111
00:37:13,020 --> 00:37:14,330
(The story of a father who lived
through Korea's history since 1950)

1112
00:37:15,160 --> 00:37:18,660
- My gosh.
- This won't be easy.

1113
00:37:18,660 --> 00:37:21,270
- That makes me even more nervous.
- Goodness.

1114
00:37:22,420 --> 00:37:24,270
This is how you describe that movie?

1115
00:37:24,270 --> 00:37:25,460
Goodness.

1116
00:37:25,960 --> 00:37:27,540
It can be described
in a much simpler way,

1117
00:37:28,230 --> 00:37:30,140
but that's what you chose to write?

1118
00:37:30,140 --> 00:37:31,170
(It's summarized
in a difficult way.)

1119
00:37:31,170 --> 00:37:32,270
It can be described though.

1120
00:37:33,040 --> 00:37:34,370
The movie is famous enough.

1121
00:37:34,370 --> 00:37:36,870
(The story of a father who lived
through Korea's history since 1950)

1122
00:37:37,810 --> 00:37:42,750
(Shoot! Throw!)

1123
00:37:42,980 --> 00:37:44,250
- What?
- He's making noises.

1124
00:37:44,980 --> 00:37:46,580
He shouldn't make noises.

1125
00:37:47,080 --> 00:37:48,660
Shouldn't he keep quiet?

1126
00:37:48,660 --> 00:37:50,060
Sound effects are fine.

1127
00:37:50,060 --> 00:37:51,230
Please refrain
from sound effects too.

1128
00:37:51,230 --> 00:37:52,560
(No sound effects)

1129
00:37:52,560 --> 00:37:54,600
- It must be a war zone.
- A battlefield.

1130
00:37:54,600 --> 00:37:56,960
(He describes the same scene,
but while muted this time.)

1131
00:37:58,230 --> 00:37:59,890
What's taking him so long?

1132
00:38:00,140 --> 00:38:01,230
He must be the criminal.

1133
00:38:01,230 --> 00:38:02,410
The time already...

1134
00:38:02,940 --> 00:38:04,310
He must be the criminal.

1135
00:38:04,310 --> 00:38:05,480
Already?

1136
00:38:06,140 --> 00:38:07,810
- He's the criminal for sure.
- Shouldn't I be explaining by now?

1137
00:38:07,810 --> 00:38:09,270
This is hilarious!

1138
00:38:09,580 --> 00:38:11,440
- Gosh, this is hilarious.
- What on earth is it?

1139
00:38:11,540 --> 00:38:13,520
I should be explaining this by now.

1140
00:38:13,520 --> 00:38:14,980
- Is it still not you?
- No.

1141
00:38:14,980 --> 00:38:16,140
(Finally, it's Sang Ho's turn.)

1142
00:38:16,140 --> 00:38:18,190
(Kwak Do Won, Suspect,
Used up all of the time)

1143
00:38:18,190 --> 00:38:19,750
Guys, we have caught
one of the criminals.

1144
00:38:20,660 --> 00:38:22,850
- He's the criminal.
- It'll be an easy win for us.

1145
00:38:22,850 --> 00:38:24,230
He's not just the suspect.

1146
00:38:24,500 --> 00:38:25,660
He's actually the criminal.

1147
00:38:25,660 --> 00:38:28,620
(He used up half of the time.)

1148
00:38:29,920 --> 00:38:33,960
(Just like Do Won did,
Sang Ho describes a battlefield.)

1149
00:38:33,960 --> 00:38:37,910
(Then he describes
finding and hugging his family.)

1150
00:38:38,230 --> 00:38:40,080
- No way.
- We're done for.

1151
00:38:40,540 --> 00:38:42,640
There's a chance
that he'll get it right.

1152
00:38:43,270 --> 00:38:44,520
Maybe.

1153
00:38:46,850 --> 00:38:48,140
That looks odd though.

1154
00:38:48,540 --> 00:38:50,790
Wait, that wasn't it at all.

1155
00:38:50,790 --> 00:38:53,420
(Jae Suk left out the first part.)

1156
00:38:53,420 --> 00:38:55,290
He's not doing it right.

1157
00:38:55,420 --> 00:38:56,560
(He then moves on
to the shooting gesture.)

1158
00:38:56,560 --> 00:38:58,330
He described that scene afterwards.

1159
00:38:58,330 --> 00:39:00,250
- You're right.
- It's like he's describing love.

1160
00:39:00,520 --> 00:39:02,100
- This is weird.
- You're making me anxious.

1161
00:39:02,100 --> 00:39:03,190
- Don't fall for it.
- Please move on.

1162
00:39:03,390 --> 00:39:05,560
- Jae Suk changed it up.
- It was super weird.

1163
00:39:05,560 --> 00:39:07,140
I can't help but be suspicious.

1164
00:39:07,140 --> 00:39:08,560
(They all start to doubt Jae Suk.)

1165
00:39:08,560 --> 00:39:09,870
- A bomb?
- Please move on.

1166
00:39:11,310 --> 00:39:12,370
What on earth is this?

1167
00:39:12,370 --> 00:39:14,580
(Only the gathering part
was focused on.)

1168
00:39:17,850 --> 00:39:19,270
What on earth is this?

1169
00:39:19,270 --> 00:39:20,480
- What...
- I have no idea.

1170
00:39:21,120 --> 00:39:23,040
(It went from finding his family
to carrying something.)

1171
00:39:23,190 --> 00:39:25,350
- Is this a mine or a tank?
- This is... What?

1172
00:39:25,350 --> 00:39:27,460
I don't know
which is why I kept asking him.

1173
00:39:28,290 --> 00:39:30,520
It's nearly impossible
to describe this.

1174
00:39:30,520 --> 00:39:32,000
- What is this? Hold on.
- Your time is up.

1175
00:39:32,230 --> 00:39:33,560
- I have no idea.
- Hold on.

1176
00:39:33,560 --> 00:39:35,290
- Let me think it through just once.
- Go ahead.

1177
00:39:36,420 --> 00:39:37,500
Over there!

1178
00:39:38,270 --> 00:39:40,060
(So Min's Dubbing)

1179
00:39:40,060 --> 00:39:41,810
"You guys, carry these."

1180
00:39:42,710 --> 00:39:44,580
(She then carries a package.)

1181
00:39:44,580 --> 00:39:47,080
(Finding family, Carrying a package)

1182
00:39:47,480 --> 00:39:50,000
- Is that how he did it?
- It's what Suk Jin did.

1183
00:39:50,850 --> 00:39:53,370
The only movie that comes to mind
is "The Front Line".

1184
00:39:53,480 --> 00:39:55,790
- What was it?
- It was hard to describe.

1185
00:39:55,920 --> 00:39:57,160
Jae Suk changed it up.

1186
00:39:57,160 --> 00:39:59,520
- It was weird.
- It made me suspect him.

1187
00:39:59,520 --> 00:40:01,790
Do Won, why don't you
show it to them?

1188
00:40:01,790 --> 00:40:03,290
- Do Won, go ahead.
- I...

1189
00:40:03,420 --> 00:40:06,330
I'm only allowed to describe
what is written, right?

1190
00:40:06,330 --> 00:40:08,190
It's impossible though.

1191
00:40:08,500 --> 00:40:11,370
Look, mister... I mean, Director.

1192
00:40:12,370 --> 00:40:14,270
You give it a try. It's impossible!

1193
00:40:14,770 --> 00:40:16,960
- Show us though.
- Okay, I will.

1194
00:40:18,210 --> 00:40:19,480
My gosh.

1195
00:40:19,910 --> 00:40:20,910
Is he doing it?

1196
00:40:21,580 --> 00:40:22,580
(The story of a father who lived
through Korea's history since 1950)

1197
00:40:22,580 --> 00:40:24,580
(A long time ago)

1198
00:40:25,810 --> 00:40:27,210
He is shooting.

1199
00:40:27,420 --> 00:40:29,040
- A grenade.
- A bomb.

1200
00:40:29,040 --> 00:40:30,120
(Up to here, the movements were
easy to understand.)

1201
00:40:30,120 --> 00:40:31,160
Death.

1202
00:40:31,580 --> 00:40:33,560
- But you...
- You...

1203
00:40:33,560 --> 00:40:35,420
- Your younger sibling.
- Yes.

1204
00:40:35,420 --> 00:40:37,160
- Your younger sibling.
- Your younger sibling.

1205
00:40:37,390 --> 00:40:39,500
- Your younger sibling...
- You have a younger sibling.

1206
00:40:39,730 --> 00:40:41,370
- Everyone died.
- Everyone got separated.

1207
00:40:41,370 --> 00:40:42,460
(Flapping)

1208
00:40:42,460 --> 00:40:43,730
(I get it.)

1209
00:40:43,730 --> 00:40:45,540
That must be it.
Everyone got separated.

1210
00:40:45,640 --> 00:40:46,890
The family members got separated.

1211
00:40:46,890 --> 00:40:48,960
- "Ode to My Father".
- The family members got separated.

1212
00:40:48,960 --> 00:40:50,230
"Ode to My Father".

1213
00:40:50,230 --> 00:40:51,480
- "Ode to My Father".
- "Ode to My Father".

1214
00:40:51,540 --> 00:40:53,140
- It was "Ode to My Father".
- It's so hard.

1215
00:40:53,140 --> 00:40:54,910
The description is so hard.

1216
00:40:54,910 --> 00:40:56,410
It's so hard.
How are we supposed to guess?

1217
00:40:56,410 --> 00:40:58,140
It makes no sense.

1218
00:40:58,140 --> 00:40:59,270
(It's time for the last question.)

1219
00:40:59,270 --> 00:41:00,350
Be careful.

1220
00:41:00,350 --> 00:41:01,920
Don't give us an overly hard one.

1221
00:41:01,920 --> 00:41:03,890
- Let's succeed.
- It's too hard.

1222
00:41:04,460 --> 00:41:05,690
Get ready.

1223
00:41:05,920 --> 00:41:07,580
Set, go.

1224
00:41:08,390 --> 00:41:09,420
(What will be the result
of the last question?)

1225
00:41:09,420 --> 00:41:11,830
- Describe exactly what you see.
- The title...

1226
00:41:11,850 --> 00:41:13,230
It's too hard.

1227
00:41:13,230 --> 00:41:14,620
It's impossible to describe it.

1228
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:17,000
(Yawning)

1229
00:41:17,190 --> 00:41:18,460
- Sang Ho!
- Yes?

1230
00:41:18,690 --> 00:41:19,790
Did you yawn just now?

1231
00:41:20,830 --> 00:41:22,870
Are you bored?

1232
00:41:22,870 --> 00:41:24,600
No, no. I am sorry.

1233
00:41:24,870 --> 00:41:26,040
Shall we begin?

1234
00:41:26,270 --> 00:41:28,350
I need to activate my brain.

1235
00:41:28,350 --> 00:41:31,040
Please be clear
when you deliver the information.

1236
00:41:31,040 --> 00:41:32,750
(Guess the answer.)

1237
00:41:33,520 --> 00:41:34,980
- Do it exactly like him.
- Just copy what you see.

1238
00:41:34,980 --> 00:41:36,850
Please see if Haha messes it up
on purpose.

1239
00:41:38,480 --> 00:41:40,690
Jong Kook is doing a good job.

1240
00:41:40,690 --> 00:41:41,690
Jong Kook isn't a criminal.

1241
00:41:41,690 --> 00:41:42,960
- No, he isn't.
- He is doing a good job.

1242
00:41:42,960 --> 00:41:45,060
The fact he is describing it
like that...

1243
00:41:45,850 --> 00:41:46,960
He isn't a criminal.

1244
00:41:48,020 --> 00:41:49,420
- But you never know.
- It's time to move on.

1245
00:41:49,600 --> 00:41:51,390
(It's Sang Ho's turn.)

1246
00:41:51,390 --> 00:41:53,190
There wasn't anything else
I could do.

1247
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:59,230
(Lively movements...)

1248
00:41:59,230 --> 00:42:01,210
(and realistic facial expressions)

1249
00:42:01,210 --> 00:42:02,810
We need to be quiet.

1250
00:42:02,810 --> 00:42:04,370
(Absorbed)

1251
00:42:05,020 --> 00:42:06,270
An actor is surely different.

1252
00:42:06,270 --> 00:42:07,420
- Please move on.
- He is good.

1253
00:42:07,420 --> 00:42:10,120
- His facial expressions...
- There isn't a sound.

1254
00:42:10,690 --> 00:42:11,810
(It's Dae Myeung's turn.)

1255
00:42:11,810 --> 00:42:13,080
There isn't a sound...

1256
00:42:13,120 --> 00:42:14,290
even when he jumps.

1257
00:42:15,080 --> 00:42:17,230
Actors are good
at using their facial expressions.

1258
00:42:17,230 --> 00:42:19,060
It's becoming more detailed.

1259
00:42:19,060 --> 00:42:21,690
(They keep adding more details.)

1260
00:42:21,690 --> 00:42:23,330
It really is becoming more detailed.

1261
00:42:23,330 --> 00:42:24,440
Actors sure are different.

1262
00:42:25,640 --> 00:42:27,000
(Okay!)

1263
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:28,000
Actors sure are different.

1264
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:30,310
We need to get this one right.

1265
00:42:30,310 --> 00:42:32,500
- What? What's going on?
- He is...

1266
00:42:32,810 --> 00:42:34,310
He is a bit strange, right?

1267
00:42:34,310 --> 00:42:35,910
We need to get this one right.

1268
00:42:35,910 --> 00:42:36,980
What?

1269
00:42:37,920 --> 00:42:39,540
(Exaggerated movements...)

1270
00:42:39,540 --> 00:42:41,480
(and strange facial expressions)

1271
00:42:41,480 --> 00:42:43,440
You make me laugh.
You make me laugh.

1272
00:42:43,440 --> 00:42:45,250
- He is definitely strange, right?
- I mean...

1273
00:42:45,250 --> 00:42:47,290
- You make me laugh.
- He is definitely strange, right?

1274
00:42:47,290 --> 00:42:49,790
I mean...
It was going well at first.

1275
00:42:49,790 --> 00:42:50,790
(My goodness!)

1276
00:42:51,420 --> 00:42:52,560
(The actors have given
an exceptional performance.)

1277
00:42:52,560 --> 00:42:54,020
It's him. It's him.

1278
00:42:54,190 --> 00:42:55,830
- What is that?
- It's him.

1279
00:42:55,870 --> 00:42:57,870
- What is that?
- It's him.

1280
00:42:58,040 --> 00:42:59,960
- It's him.
- Is he channeling Gollum or what?

1281
00:42:59,960 --> 00:43:01,460
- It's him.
- That's Gollum.

1282
00:43:01,460 --> 00:43:02,670
- It's him.
- I mean...

1283
00:43:02,670 --> 00:43:04,040
The quality fell drastically.

1284
00:43:04,040 --> 00:43:05,480
Is he channeling Gollum or what?

1285
00:43:05,480 --> 00:43:06,980
Gollum of "The Lord of the Rings".

1286
00:43:07,210 --> 00:43:08,940
Okay, I got it.

1287
00:43:09,250 --> 00:43:10,980
(Is it "Mission: Impossible"?)

1288
00:43:12,250 --> 00:43:14,350
- Is it right?
- You can't ask for a hint.

1289
00:43:15,020 --> 00:43:17,560
(If So Min gets it right,)

1290
00:43:17,560 --> 00:43:18,850
(they can narrow down
the criminal candidates.)

1291
00:43:18,850 --> 00:43:21,660
Gollum? "The Lord of the Rings"?
Gollum?

1292
00:43:21,660 --> 00:43:23,560
(Will So Min get the answer right
despite Haha's terrible acting?)

1293
00:43:23,560 --> 00:43:25,160
Gollum of "The Lord of the Rings".

1294
00:43:25,250 --> 00:43:26,660
You can't ask for a hint.

1295
00:43:26,730 --> 00:43:27,890
"The Thieves".

1296
00:43:27,890 --> 00:43:30,940
("The Thieves")

1297
00:43:30,940 --> 00:43:32,270
(Correct)

1298
00:43:32,270 --> 00:43:34,140
(She got the answer right
in a surprising turn of events.)

1299
00:43:34,140 --> 00:43:35,600
- How did she get it right?
- See?

1300
00:43:35,600 --> 00:43:38,100
- I am not a criminal.
- You were Gollum.

1301
00:43:38,100 --> 00:43:39,540
(Korean and Chinese thieves join
to steal a diamond in Macau.)

1302
00:43:40,270 --> 00:43:41,370
(Sang Ho and Dae Myeung
created this miracle.)

1303
00:43:41,370 --> 00:43:42,710
That was incredible.

1304
00:43:42,710 --> 00:43:44,020
I knew it was "The Thieves".

1305
00:43:44,020 --> 00:43:45,020
Right?

1306
00:43:45,020 --> 00:43:47,040
- I knew it.
- You were Gollum.

1307
00:43:47,040 --> 00:43:48,120
No, I wasn't.

1308
00:43:48,120 --> 00:43:50,020
She is a genius.

1309
00:43:50,020 --> 00:43:51,290
How did she know?

1310
00:43:51,290 --> 00:43:52,350
(Haha's chaotic performance
couldn't deter her.)

1311
00:43:52,350 --> 00:43:55,060
Sang Ho and Dae Myeung
did an amazing job.

1312
00:43:55,060 --> 00:43:57,290
Their performances had
so much depth.

1313
00:43:57,420 --> 00:44:00,190
We saw Haha's acting skills
from "Holy Daddy".

1314
00:44:00,460 --> 00:44:01,920
- Right?
- We enjoyed your performance.

1315
00:44:01,920 --> 00:44:04,440
- "Holy Daddy".
- We enjoyed your performance.

1316
00:44:04,460 --> 00:44:06,390
Haha's acting skills
from "Holy Daddy".

1317
00:44:07,140 --> 00:44:10,730
I will reveal the identity
of one person...

1318
00:44:10,730 --> 00:44:12,640
who isn't a criminal.

1319
00:44:12,770 --> 00:44:15,440
That person would be
a civilian or a police officer.

1320
00:44:15,810 --> 00:44:16,810
Okay.

1321
00:44:16,810 --> 00:44:18,350
To the two criminals,
we will reveal...

1322
00:44:18,350 --> 00:44:21,080
the identity of one person
who isn't a police officer.

1323
00:44:21,440 --> 00:44:23,540
The criminals will know,
"That person is a civilian,"

1324
00:44:23,540 --> 00:44:25,210
"not a police officer."

1325
00:44:25,460 --> 00:44:28,850
One person who definitely isn't
a criminal is...

1326
00:44:30,560 --> 00:44:33,250
(He picks one at random.)

1327
00:44:33,250 --> 00:44:34,670
(Song Ji Hyo)

1328
00:44:34,870 --> 00:44:35,920
Song Ji Hyo.

1329
00:44:37,440 --> 00:44:38,540
I knew that.

1330
00:44:38,770 --> 00:44:40,140
I'm just a citizen.

1331
00:44:40,640 --> 00:44:43,730
As for the criminals,
we will pick one at random...

1332
00:44:43,730 --> 00:44:45,910
and relay the information
via a text.

1333
00:44:45,910 --> 00:44:47,080
- A text?
- To the criminals?

1334
00:44:47,080 --> 00:44:49,350
Why don't you tell the criminals
to come forward?

1335
00:44:49,350 --> 00:44:51,120
(Whose identity
did the criminals get?)

1336
00:44:51,120 --> 00:44:53,370
- We will keep our eyes closed.
- That's right.

1337
00:44:53,480 --> 00:44:55,210
It's time for the final race.

1338
00:44:55,420 --> 00:44:57,690
It's your last chance to arrest
the two criminals...

1339
00:44:57,690 --> 00:45:00,690
who are hiding among
innocent civilians.

1340
00:45:00,690 --> 00:45:04,120
Through the 2 interrogations
that open every 30 minutes,

1341
00:45:04,120 --> 00:45:06,190
you can arrest the criminals.

1342
00:45:06,190 --> 00:45:07,500
If you arrest both criminals,

1343
00:45:07,500 --> 00:45:08,790
the police officers
and civilians win.

1344
00:45:09,060 --> 00:45:10,370
If you fail to arrest
the criminals...

1345
00:45:10,370 --> 00:45:11,640
or all the police officers
get eliminated first,

1346
00:45:11,640 --> 00:45:13,040
the criminals win.

1347
00:45:13,040 --> 00:45:16,330
Every 30 minutes, we will gather
in the interrogation room.

1348
00:45:16,710 --> 00:45:18,830
You can vote
for a criminal candidate...

1349
00:45:18,830 --> 00:45:21,270
and check the identity of the person
who gets the most number of votes.

1350
00:45:23,170 --> 00:45:24,810
Inside the building,

1351
00:45:24,810 --> 00:45:27,750
10 members' name tags are hidden.

1352
00:45:28,210 --> 00:45:30,960
If you turn in four name tags
at the detective agency,

1353
00:45:31,580 --> 00:45:33,980
you will see
if there are more police officers,

1354
00:45:33,980 --> 00:45:36,020
more criminals,
or the same number of both.

1355
00:45:36,020 --> 00:45:37,620
- We will see that.
- You will see that.

1356
00:45:37,620 --> 00:45:39,000
If all four people are civilians,
you will get,

1357
00:45:39,160 --> 00:45:41,870
"There are neither criminals
nor police officers."

1358
00:45:41,870 --> 00:45:43,000
(There are neither criminals
nor police officers.)

1359
00:45:43,060 --> 00:45:46,170
If we add Ji Hyo's name tag,
the result will be more helpful.

1360
00:45:46,170 --> 00:45:47,370
(The combination of name tags
is very important.)

1361
00:45:47,370 --> 00:45:51,370
We will announce the result
to everyone...

1362
00:45:51,370 --> 00:45:54,350
without revealing
the four name tags.

1363
00:45:54,980 --> 00:45:57,350
Then we will be able to lie
about the four names.

1364
00:45:57,350 --> 00:45:58,350
(The criminal will be able to lie
about the 4 names.)

1365
00:45:58,350 --> 00:46:01,390
Now, please move to your spot.

1366
00:46:01,390 --> 00:46:02,690
Let's go!

1367
00:46:05,350 --> 00:46:08,390
The last game made me certain...

1368
00:46:08,390 --> 00:46:12,160
that something's up
with Kwang Soo and Haha.

1369
00:46:12,730 --> 00:46:13,850
That's what I think.

1370
00:46:13,850 --> 00:46:15,920
(Ji Hyo is suspicious
of Kwang Soo and Haha.)

1371
00:46:15,920 --> 00:46:18,040
(She is a civilian!)

1372
00:46:18,170 --> 00:46:19,870
It definitely seemed like...

1373
00:46:20,670 --> 00:46:23,830
Do Won guessed the answer wrong
on purpose.

1374
00:46:24,440 --> 00:46:25,910
Jae Suk and Haha.

1375
00:46:25,910 --> 00:46:26,980
(Do Won thinks the criminals are
Jae Suk and Haha.)

1376
00:46:26,980 --> 00:46:29,370
When Jae Suk describing the movie,

1377
00:46:30,250 --> 00:46:32,670
he was too clumsy.

1378
00:46:33,350 --> 00:46:35,980
I think either Haha or Kwang Soo is
a criminal.

1379
00:46:37,520 --> 00:46:41,120
(What could be
the identity of these 4 people?)

1380
00:46:41,830 --> 00:46:44,350
I will stick the name tag
before the race begins.

1381
00:46:44,560 --> 00:46:45,560
Okay.

1382
00:46:45,560 --> 00:46:48,290
(The person
with the police officer name tag,)

1383
00:46:48,290 --> 00:46:53,140
(Kim Dae Myeung)

1384
00:46:53,390 --> 00:46:55,540
Today, you will have
the Domestic Investigation Race.

1385
00:46:55,830 --> 00:46:57,980
You are a senior police officer
and a newbie police officer...

1386
00:46:57,980 --> 00:47:00,210
who infiltrated
a morning soccer club...

1387
00:47:00,440 --> 00:47:01,810
after receiving a tip-off...

1388
00:47:01,810 --> 00:47:04,210
that some criminals are smugging out
seasoned salt.

1389
00:47:05,640 --> 00:47:07,850
So 2 police officers need to catch
2 criminals.

1390
00:47:08,520 --> 00:47:11,690
We need to catch two criminals
among civilians.

1391
00:47:12,790 --> 00:47:13,850
Song Ji Hyo.

1392
00:47:13,850 --> 00:47:15,120
(Even after the second mission,)

1393
00:47:15,120 --> 00:47:17,620
(Dae Myeung stayed alert
since he is a police officer.)

1394
00:47:19,190 --> 00:47:20,420
I will do my best.

1395
00:47:20,420 --> 00:47:22,000
(Will Dae Myeung be able
to arrest the 2 criminals?)

1396
00:47:22,290 --> 00:47:23,890
The race will begin.

1397
00:47:23,890 --> 00:47:25,000
Five,

1398
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:26,870
4, 3...

1399
00:47:26,870 --> 00:47:28,460
2, 1.

1400
00:47:28,770 --> 00:47:30,170
The race starts.

1401
00:47:31,540 --> 00:47:35,000
Finding the name tags is a priority,

1402
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:36,080
right?

1403
00:47:36,080 --> 00:47:37,870
(They diligently search
for the name tags.)

1404
00:47:37,870 --> 00:47:40,370
Does everyone search this way?

1405
00:47:41,710 --> 00:47:44,190
(The name tags
are hidden very carefully.)

1406
00:47:45,020 --> 00:47:46,120
What?

1407
00:47:47,190 --> 00:47:50,190
(Looking around)

1408
00:47:51,190 --> 00:47:53,520
A really nice camera
is following you around...

1409
00:47:53,520 --> 00:47:54,690
right now.

1410
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:56,230
- Right?
- Yes.

1411
00:47:56,230 --> 00:47:57,890
Why is it following you around?

1412
00:47:58,330 --> 00:47:59,960
I guess I will do something.

1413
00:48:01,830 --> 00:48:04,140
I don't know what,
but I guess I will do something.

1414
00:48:05,270 --> 00:48:07,670
You are suspicious.
You are too suspicious.

1415
00:48:07,710 --> 00:48:10,100
- Where are you going?
- I am going to find the name tags.

1416
00:48:10,100 --> 00:48:11,540
Should I stay here?

1417
00:48:11,540 --> 00:48:13,140
- No, no. Let's meet later.
- Should I...

1418
00:48:13,140 --> 00:48:14,540
- Later? Can I move?
- See you later.

1419
00:48:14,640 --> 00:48:16,520
Of course. You should move.

1420
00:48:16,520 --> 00:48:19,750
(Sang Ho made a suspicious comment.
What could be his identity?)

1421
00:48:19,850 --> 00:48:21,920
Jae Suk. Earlier, Do Won...

1422
00:48:21,920 --> 00:48:24,060
- I hear Kwang Soo's voice.
- He made sure...

1423
00:48:24,060 --> 00:48:25,120
(He puts on a kind smile.)

1424
00:48:25,120 --> 00:48:26,330
What's your role for today?

1425
00:48:26,330 --> 00:48:27,560
I am nothing.

1426
00:48:28,560 --> 00:48:30,290
I think he is playing a role today.

1427
00:48:30,290 --> 00:48:31,330
Me?

1428
00:48:31,960 --> 00:48:33,370
That's right. How did you know?

1429
00:48:33,370 --> 00:48:34,500
(He holds his hands together.)

1430
00:48:34,500 --> 00:48:35,770
That's right. How did you know?

1431
00:48:35,770 --> 00:48:37,710
(He moves his hands awkwardly.)

1432
00:48:38,410 --> 00:48:39,940
- Wasn't it really awkward?
- Jae Suk.

1433
00:48:40,100 --> 00:48:43,140
It was the worst performance
I have seen in my life.

1434
00:48:43,310 --> 00:48:45,750
- "How did you know?"
- Who rubs hands together like that?

1435
00:48:46,850 --> 00:48:48,120
It's not like that.

1436
00:48:48,120 --> 00:48:49,620
You should find the name tags...

1437
00:48:49,620 --> 00:48:51,660
and stop being suspicious of me.

1438
00:48:51,660 --> 00:48:52,850
Suk Jin,

1439
00:48:52,850 --> 00:48:54,730
just get your name tag ripped off
and go to the jail.

1440
00:48:55,350 --> 00:48:58,250
If we stay too far from Jong Kook,

1441
00:48:58,250 --> 00:48:59,920
- he will become suspicious.
- You are right.

1442
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:02,190
- Why are you...
- We were on his way to find him.

1443
00:49:02,190 --> 00:49:03,420
There is nothing.

1444
00:49:03,420 --> 00:49:04,440
(Meanwhile,
Dae Myeung the police officer...)

1445
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:06,690
(is searching diligently.)

1446
00:49:07,390 --> 00:49:08,870
- Welcome.
- Gosh, that startled me.

1447
00:49:08,870 --> 00:49:10,230
Insert your card...

1448
00:49:10,230 --> 00:49:11,670
- Welcome.
- Gosh, that startled me.

1449
00:49:11,670 --> 00:49:12,770
(Gosh, that startled me.)

1450
00:49:13,830 --> 00:49:17,310
(The newbie police officer
gets startled about everything.)

1451
00:49:18,170 --> 00:49:19,640
(Peeking)

1452
00:49:20,480 --> 00:49:22,920
Dae Myeung.

1453
00:49:22,920 --> 00:49:24,140
(Flinching)

1454
00:49:24,920 --> 00:49:27,080
What are you doing? What's there?

1455
00:49:27,480 --> 00:49:29,660
- Dae Myeung.
- Yes?

1456
00:49:30,020 --> 00:49:31,160
You are a civilian, right?

1457
00:49:31,160 --> 00:49:32,330
- Me?
- Yes.

1458
00:49:32,890 --> 00:49:35,500
(Thinking)

1459
00:49:35,500 --> 00:49:36,790
What's good about it?

1460
00:49:37,190 --> 00:49:39,690
Just tell me what your identity is.

1461
00:49:40,140 --> 00:49:41,830
- Are you a civilian?
- You seem like a civilian.

1462
00:49:41,830 --> 00:49:43,000
I am a civilian.

1463
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:46,670
(Meanwhile,
Haha is looking for a name tag.)

1464
00:49:47,640 --> 00:49:49,980
(He finally finds a name tag.)

1465
00:49:50,710 --> 00:49:52,940
(The name tag he found belongs...)

1466
00:49:52,940 --> 00:49:54,520
(to himself.)

1467
00:49:54,520 --> 00:49:55,540
It's mine.

1468
00:49:55,540 --> 00:49:56,710
(He acquired his own name tag.)

1469
00:49:57,140 --> 00:49:58,750
It'd be easier to figure out.

1470
00:49:58,750 --> 00:50:01,290
(If he acquires 3 more name tags,
he can go to the Detective Agency.)

1471
00:50:02,290 --> 00:50:04,600
(Sang Ho finds something too.)

1472
00:50:04,600 --> 00:50:05,660
I found one.

1473
00:50:08,270 --> 00:50:10,600
(He acquires a criminal candidate,
Do Won's name tag.)

1474
00:50:10,600 --> 00:50:12,330
I need to find them fast.

1475
00:50:13,830 --> 00:50:15,810
(He takes off his shoes
and searches diligently.)

1476
00:50:15,810 --> 00:50:17,100
Do Won.

1477
00:50:17,440 --> 00:50:18,600
Did you find something?

1478
00:50:18,600 --> 00:50:19,670
No.

1479
00:50:20,100 --> 00:50:22,710
Am I really supposed to search
every room?

1480
00:50:22,710 --> 00:50:25,170
You know two people
who aren't criminals, right?

1481
00:50:25,170 --> 00:50:26,540
Two people who aren't criminals.

1482
00:50:26,540 --> 00:50:28,190
- You got the names as a hint.
- That's right.

1483
00:50:28,190 --> 00:50:31,020
(Do Won claimed that he asked
for 2 people who aren't criminals.)

1484
00:50:31,020 --> 00:50:32,060
Who were they?

1485
00:50:32,120 --> 00:50:33,120
Well,

1486
00:50:33,520 --> 00:50:35,230
I don't know if I should tell you.

1487
00:50:35,250 --> 00:50:36,980
- You shouldn't, Do Won.
- I shouldn't, right?

1488
00:50:36,980 --> 00:50:38,730
- You shouldn't.
- But you can tell...

1489
00:50:38,730 --> 00:50:40,500
those two people.

1490
00:50:41,290 --> 00:50:44,020
You can tell those two people
since they aren't criminals.

1491
00:50:44,020 --> 00:50:45,540
- Right?
- You can tell Ji Hyo.

1492
00:50:50,990 --> 00:50:52,100
(Torn)

1493
00:50:52,160 --> 00:50:54,160
Ji Hyo and her.

1494
00:50:54,430 --> 00:50:55,600
- Was So Min one of them?
- Yes.

1495
00:50:55,600 --> 00:50:56,840
(Ji Hyo and her.)

1496
00:50:56,840 --> 00:50:58,840
(Do Won claims
that So Min is a civilian.)

1497
00:50:58,840 --> 00:51:00,300
- Was she 1 of them?
- I was?

1498
00:51:00,300 --> 00:51:02,510
Yes. She is a civilian.

1499
00:51:03,200 --> 00:51:06,180
- I am a civilian.
- Was it a good idea to tell you?

1500
00:51:06,850 --> 00:51:08,870
Was it? It wasn't, right?

1501
00:51:08,870 --> 00:51:10,490
- To be honest...
- You could be a criminal.

1502
00:51:10,490 --> 00:51:12,220
I could be a criminal,

1503
00:51:12,220 --> 00:51:13,680
so you shouldn't share information
unless you are certain.

1504
00:51:13,680 --> 00:51:14,720
Seriously.

1505
00:51:15,120 --> 00:51:16,660
- You shouldn't do that.
- No.

1506
00:51:16,680 --> 00:51:17,930
- You shouldn't do that.
- You are right.

1507
00:51:17,930 --> 00:51:19,680
To be honest,
I am suspicious of Jae Suk.

1508
00:51:20,050 --> 00:51:21,620
Me? Why?

1509
00:51:21,850 --> 00:51:23,030
Did you receive a hint?

1510
00:51:23,320 --> 00:51:25,530
No, I didn't. It's just a hunch.

1511
00:51:26,100 --> 00:51:27,870
- For goodness' sake.
- A hint...

1512
00:51:27,870 --> 00:51:29,030
(Do Won stares intently.)

1513
00:51:29,030 --> 00:51:30,200
Now...

1514
00:51:30,200 --> 00:51:31,240
(He averts his eyes.)

1515
00:51:31,240 --> 00:51:33,410
- Jae Suk.
- What?

1516
00:51:34,410 --> 00:51:35,570
What?

1517
00:51:35,570 --> 00:51:36,600
(He suddenly changed the subject.)

1518
00:51:36,600 --> 00:51:37,600
Come on.

1519
00:51:37,700 --> 00:51:38,700
I am not a criminal.

1520
00:51:38,700 --> 00:51:39,700
(Stern)

1521
00:51:40,510 --> 00:51:41,740
Are you just a fool?

1522
00:51:41,970 --> 00:51:43,510
- What are you saying?
- Are you just a fool?

1523
00:51:43,510 --> 00:51:45,620
(Do Won does some fact-checking
without a warning.)

1524
00:51:45,890 --> 00:51:47,390
What are you saying?

1525
00:51:47,510 --> 00:51:48,820
I am a civilian.

1526
00:51:49,850 --> 00:51:51,260
You are suspicious too.

1527
00:51:51,260 --> 00:51:52,390
He is just a fool.

1528
00:51:52,390 --> 00:51:53,430
But...

1529
00:51:55,350 --> 00:51:56,390
I think...

1530
00:51:57,930 --> 00:52:00,100
(Her name tag almost got ripped off
due to the frame.)

1531
00:52:00,840 --> 00:52:03,570
Someone who does that
is a bigger fool, don't you think?

1532
00:52:04,430 --> 00:52:08,100
She almost got eliminated
because her name tag got caught.

1533
00:52:08,100 --> 00:52:09,510
Had it come off,
you would have gotten eliminated.

1534
00:52:09,510 --> 00:52:11,140
Really? Really?

1535
00:52:12,140 --> 00:52:13,570
The name tags wouldn't be here,
right?

1536
00:52:13,570 --> 00:52:15,120
Let's search a bit more.

1537
00:52:15,120 --> 00:52:16,590
- Would they be someplace visible?
- We should go upstairs.

1538
00:52:16,590 --> 00:52:18,350
I don't think we should stay here.

1539
00:52:19,010 --> 00:52:21,220
- Ji Hyo, did you find something?
- It looks like you did.

1540
00:52:21,220 --> 00:52:22,350
I didn't find anything.

1541
00:52:22,350 --> 00:52:25,090
The layout of this building
is difficult today.

1542
00:52:25,390 --> 00:52:26,390
- Seriously.
- What?

1543
00:52:27,430 --> 00:52:29,300
I heard you go, "What?"

1544
00:52:29,300 --> 00:52:30,890
- What is this?
- What?

1545
00:52:33,300 --> 00:52:34,390
(What is this doing here?)

1546
00:52:34,390 --> 00:52:36,370
- I know what it is.
- Seasoned salt.

1547
00:52:37,970 --> 00:52:41,410
(Do Won passed security
with soccer balls.)

1548
00:52:41,410 --> 00:52:44,780
(Seasoned salt came out
of the soccer ball.)

1549
00:52:46,640 --> 00:52:48,180
- What is it doing here?
- Keep it.

1550
00:52:48,180 --> 00:52:49,510
Do the criminals need to find this?

1551
00:52:49,510 --> 00:52:51,220
I bet the criminals
need to find this.

1552
00:52:52,720 --> 00:52:55,120
(Do the criminals need
the seasoned salt?)

1553
00:52:55,950 --> 00:52:58,620
(Dae Myeung is absorbed
in looking for the name tags.)

1554
00:52:58,620 --> 00:53:00,300
(He spots something!)

1555
00:53:02,620 --> 00:53:04,570
(Dae Myeung finds
the seasoned salt as well.)

1556
00:53:04,570 --> 00:53:05,990
(However,)

1557
00:53:06,800 --> 00:53:08,800
(he glances around...)

1558
00:53:08,800 --> 00:53:10,840
(and bags the seasoned salt.)

1559
00:53:10,840 --> 00:53:13,240
(Why is a police officer bagging
the seasoned salt?)

1560
00:53:13,910 --> 00:53:15,910
(The police officers' hidden rule)

1561
00:53:16,800 --> 00:53:18,410
(1 pack of seasoned salt...)

1562
00:53:18,410 --> 00:53:21,010
(equals 1 blank name tag.)

1563
00:53:21,370 --> 00:53:24,780
(Police officers can use it
as a name tag of their choice.)

1564
00:53:25,950 --> 00:53:27,890
I don't have much time.

1565
00:53:29,350 --> 00:53:30,780
- Suk Jin.
- You don't seem like a criminal.

1566
00:53:30,780 --> 00:53:32,120
- Suk Jin.
- You are working very hard today.

1567
00:53:32,120 --> 00:53:33,700
After we collect four name tags,

1568
00:53:33,700 --> 00:53:35,220
let's call Ji Hyo over.

1569
00:53:36,050 --> 00:53:37,220
Let's make her go in.

1570
00:53:37,220 --> 00:53:38,970
- My goodness.
- It's a good idea.

1571
00:53:38,970 --> 00:53:40,070
- Did you find anything?
- Listen.

1572
00:53:40,070 --> 00:53:41,800
- Name tag.
- Does anyone have a name tag?

1573
00:53:41,800 --> 00:53:43,100
- I have one.
- Really?

1574
00:53:43,100 --> 00:53:44,340
- I have 1.
- Then we have 4.

1575
00:53:44,340 --> 00:53:45,340
- We have four.
- What?

1576
00:53:45,340 --> 00:53:47,840
- We can't trust anyone right now.
- That's right.

1577
00:53:47,840 --> 00:53:49,870
Let's give the name tags to Ji Hyo
so that we can go in...

1578
00:53:49,870 --> 00:53:51,200
- and check.
- That works.

1579
00:53:51,200 --> 00:53:53,570
Ji Hyo is a civilian anyway.

1580
00:53:54,350 --> 00:53:56,350
(The Detective Agency exists
at every building.)

1581
00:53:57,780 --> 00:53:59,350
(If you take 4 name tags,
you can see...)

1582
00:53:59,350 --> 00:54:03,720
(the ratio of the police officers
and criminals.)

1583
00:54:04,050 --> 00:54:05,090
- Haha.
- All right.

1584
00:54:05,090 --> 00:54:06,590
- Kwang Soo.
- Suk Jin. Who is the last one?

1585
00:54:06,590 --> 00:54:07,930
- Do Won.
- I think...

1586
00:54:07,930 --> 00:54:09,300
- We have four name tags.
- Let's take these...

1587
00:54:09,300 --> 00:54:10,720
- to Ji Hyo.
- Ji Hyo.

1588
00:54:10,800 --> 00:54:11,800
Let's find Ji Hyo.

1589
00:54:11,800 --> 00:54:12,930
We have
Haha and Kwang Soo's name tags.

1590
00:54:12,930 --> 00:54:13,970
- I know.
- This is insane.

1591
00:54:13,970 --> 00:54:15,390
- This is unbelievable.
- Ji Hyo!

1592
00:54:15,390 --> 00:54:16,600
Ji Hyo, come here.

1593
00:54:16,800 --> 00:54:17,840
Yes?

1594
00:54:17,840 --> 00:54:18,840
- Come here.
- Hurry up.

1595
00:54:18,840 --> 00:54:20,510
- You are safe.
- We have a mission for you.

1596
00:54:20,510 --> 00:54:21,780
- Ji Hyo, go ahead.
- Okay.

1597
00:54:21,780 --> 00:54:23,200
- Okay.
- All right.

1598
00:54:24,350 --> 00:54:26,240
(She has 4 name tags in her hand.)

1599
00:54:28,680 --> 00:54:30,240
I took on a big mission.

1600
00:54:31,410 --> 00:54:33,620
Suk Jin, Do Won, Kwang Soo,
and Haha.

1601
00:54:33,620 --> 00:54:36,010
(She submits the four name tags.)

1602
00:54:36,490 --> 00:54:38,620
Ji Hyo has no reason to lie.

1603
00:54:38,620 --> 00:54:39,820
She has no reason to lie.

1604
00:54:39,820 --> 00:54:41,850
We are 50 percent there.

1605
00:54:41,850 --> 00:54:43,300
That's right. We are nearly there.

1606
00:54:43,300 --> 00:54:45,820
Whose name tags did she take?
Haha, me...

1607
00:54:45,820 --> 00:54:48,160
- Do Won and me.
- Kwang Soo, calm down.

1608
00:54:48,200 --> 00:54:51,260
I am just happy that I will be able
to focus on the race now.

1609
00:54:51,660 --> 00:54:52,870
Calm down.

1610
00:54:52,870 --> 00:54:54,430
Do Won and Suk Jin. Okay.

1611
00:54:54,970 --> 00:54:56,970
(The result finally comes out.)

1612
00:54:57,240 --> 00:54:58,350
It's out.

1613
00:54:58,350 --> 00:55:02,070
(What the ratio of the criminals
and police officers?)

1614
00:55:02,070 --> 00:55:03,910
(No way!)

1615
00:55:04,140 --> 00:55:05,780
- She's here!.
- The Detective Agency...

1616
00:55:05,780 --> 00:55:07,510
- Don't say anything yet.
- Everyone, be quiet.

1617
00:55:07,510 --> 00:55:09,350
According to the result...

1618
00:55:10,720 --> 00:55:14,700
(More police officers or criminals,
the same number of both, or neither)

1619
00:55:14,700 --> 00:55:17,700
(What's the ratio
among these 4 members?)

1620
00:55:17,700 --> 00:55:19,990
The number is equivalent.

1621
00:55:20,070 --> 00:55:22,470
- What?
- What?

1622
00:55:22,470 --> 00:55:24,570
(The same number
of police officers and criminals?)

1623
00:55:25,010 --> 00:55:26,010
The ratio?

1624
00:55:26,300 --> 00:55:27,570
- Really?
- Then...

1625
00:55:27,570 --> 00:55:29,030
There could be one of each...

1626
00:55:29,030 --> 00:55:31,680
- or two of each.
- Yes, one of each.

1627
00:55:31,680 --> 00:55:33,620
- Police officers and criminals...
- The same number.

1628
00:55:33,620 --> 00:55:35,620
They are in the same number.

1629
00:55:35,620 --> 00:55:37,740
There is either 1 of each
or 2 of each.

1630
00:55:37,820 --> 00:55:39,590
- In that case...
- Two of each is unlikely.

1631
00:55:39,590 --> 00:55:41,090
- It's unlikely.
- It's unlikely.

1632
00:55:41,090 --> 00:55:42,220
There must be one of each.

1633
00:55:42,220 --> 00:55:43,220
(Everyone is busy deducting.)

1634
00:55:43,850 --> 00:55:46,090
(Dae Myeung shows
a meaningful smile.)

1635
00:55:46,090 --> 00:55:49,390
The first race is over.
Come to the Interrogation Room.

1636
00:55:49,700 --> 00:55:51,800
You acted so strange at times.

1637
00:55:51,800 --> 00:55:53,600
I don't have a clue today.

1638
00:55:53,600 --> 00:55:55,100
There wasn't Jae Suk's name tag.

1639
00:55:55,100 --> 00:55:56,140
I am not a criminal.

1640
00:55:56,140 --> 00:55:59,100
He could be the second criminal.

1641
00:55:59,240 --> 00:56:02,030
I think my initial guess was
completely off.

1642
00:56:02,030 --> 00:56:04,300
It's time
for the first interrogation.

1643
00:56:04,510 --> 00:56:06,100
Currently, there are
a total of 10 people remaining...

1644
00:56:06,100 --> 00:56:08,640
which includes 2 criminals
and 2 police officers.

1645
00:56:08,850 --> 00:56:10,620
Please discuss freely...

1646
00:56:10,620 --> 00:56:13,220
and arrest a criminal later on
with a vote.

1647
00:56:13,220 --> 00:56:14,350
All right.

1648
00:56:14,350 --> 00:56:15,680
(Who will be picked as a criminal
after the first interrogation?)

1649
00:56:15,680 --> 00:56:19,930
Let's make our guesses
based on the result we got...

1650
00:56:19,930 --> 00:56:22,030
- from the Detective Agency.
- Let's do that.

1651
00:56:22,030 --> 00:56:23,970
- Let's do that.
- Leave this to us.

1652
00:56:23,970 --> 00:56:25,300
- Okay.
- We shouldn't start...

1653
00:56:25,300 --> 00:56:27,160
- anywhere else.
- At first,

1654
00:56:27,240 --> 00:56:28,930
I received two hints.

1655
00:56:28,930 --> 00:56:29,930
(I received two hints.)

1656
00:56:29,930 --> 00:56:31,410
(Do Won received a hint
after the first mission.)

1657
00:56:31,410 --> 00:56:33,030
- That's right.
- There we go.

1658
00:56:33,030 --> 00:56:34,430
You should tell us what you know.

1659
00:56:34,430 --> 00:56:35,800
- Hold on.
- Why didn't you tell us sooner?

1660
00:56:35,800 --> 00:56:37,300
- I will tell you now.
- But we don't know...

1661
00:56:37,300 --> 00:56:38,850
if he will speak truthfully.

1662
00:56:38,850 --> 00:56:40,220
- Since I wasn't sure.
- This is important.

1663
00:56:40,510 --> 00:56:43,120
You know, Do Won looks...

1664
00:56:43,220 --> 00:56:45,220
a bit like a retired detective.

1665
00:56:45,220 --> 00:56:46,220
(He looks
a bit like a retired detective.)

1666
00:56:46,220 --> 00:56:47,850
(He is 100 percent in sync
with the position.)

1667
00:56:47,850 --> 00:56:49,320
- Right?
- That's right.

1668
00:56:49,320 --> 00:56:51,720
Do Won looks
a bit like a retired detective.

1669
00:56:51,720 --> 00:56:52,820
- A private investigator.
- He works as one now.

1670
00:56:52,820 --> 00:56:54,450
He quit and began to work
as a private investigator.

1671
00:56:54,600 --> 00:56:56,660
I will share what I know
to prevent civilian casualties.

1672
00:56:56,660 --> 00:56:57,700
- You should do that.
- You should.

1673
00:56:57,700 --> 00:56:58,820
That's right. You should tell us.

1674
00:56:58,820 --> 00:57:01,840
I ask that you trust me to be...

1675
00:57:01,840 --> 00:57:02,970
- a civilian.
- Okay.

1676
00:57:02,970 --> 00:57:05,760
Two people who aren't criminals.

1677
00:57:06,530 --> 00:57:08,700
The man with a kind face, Sang Ho.
Where is he?

1678
00:57:08,700 --> 00:57:10,410
- Sang Ho.
- He has a kind face.

1679
00:57:10,410 --> 00:57:12,700
- He isn't a criminal.
- He isn't a criminal.

1680
00:57:12,700 --> 00:57:14,470
- He isn't?
- In the beginning...

1681
00:57:14,470 --> 00:57:15,970
I don't think
Sang Ho is a criminal either.

1682
00:57:15,970 --> 00:57:18,010
- Go on.
- And the other one is...

1683
00:57:18,890 --> 00:57:20,950
the woman who got the answers right
like a genius in the mission,

1684
00:57:20,950 --> 00:57:23,090
- So Min. She isn't a criminal.
- So Min.

1685
00:57:23,260 --> 00:57:24,680
- I told you that I am not.
- Did you get her name?

1686
00:57:24,680 --> 00:57:26,450
- The staff randomly picked,
- The staff randomly picked,

1687
00:57:26,450 --> 00:57:28,390
- and they got Sang Ho and So Min?
- and there was So Min's name.

1688
00:57:28,390 --> 00:57:29,930
- So Min isn't a criminal.
- Really?

1689
00:57:29,930 --> 00:57:31,490
- I knew it.
- Why wouldn't you believe him?

1690
00:57:31,490 --> 00:57:33,320
- I knew you weren't a criminal.
- I knew it.

1691
00:57:33,320 --> 00:57:35,240
- So Min isn't a criminal.
- It's that jerk.

1692
00:57:35,240 --> 00:57:36,700
(Suddenly)

1693
00:57:36,700 --> 00:57:38,200
(Incredulous)

1694
00:57:38,200 --> 00:57:40,340
What are you saying?

1695
00:57:40,340 --> 00:57:41,600
(Is Do Won's claim true?)

1696
00:57:41,870 --> 00:57:43,600
Kwang Soo, do something
about your hands.

1697
00:57:43,600 --> 00:57:45,780
- Seriously.
- Can't you relax your hands?

1698
00:57:45,780 --> 00:57:47,350
He is definitely a criminal.

1699
00:57:47,350 --> 00:57:48,350
(He makes hearts.)

1700
00:57:48,850 --> 00:57:49,870
I am not a criminal.

1701
00:57:49,870 --> 00:57:53,720
If Do Won is a criminal...

1702
00:57:53,720 --> 00:57:55,510
- There could be a police officer.
- Right.

1703
00:57:55,620 --> 00:57:57,430
It's ironic...

1704
00:57:57,430 --> 00:57:59,050
- because the ones that came up...
- "Ironic"?

1705
00:57:59,050 --> 00:58:01,450
Why did you suddenly use
the word, "Ironic"?

1706
00:58:02,300 --> 00:58:03,970
Doesn't it suit the situation?

1707
00:58:04,600 --> 00:58:05,970
Go ahead and tell me!
Doesn't it suit the situation?

1708
00:58:05,970 --> 00:58:07,300
No, no.

1709
00:58:07,300 --> 00:58:08,600
Doesn't it suit the situation?

1710
00:58:08,600 --> 00:58:10,600
- I doubt you know what it means.
- "Ironic".

1711
00:58:10,600 --> 00:58:11,930
Isn't this an ironic situation?

1712
00:58:11,930 --> 00:58:13,240
Can you spell it?

1713
00:58:13,240 --> 00:58:15,070
- "Ironic".
- Hold on.

1714
00:58:15,100 --> 00:58:16,240
Is it an English word?

1715
00:58:16,240 --> 00:58:17,700
He asks if it's an English word.

1716
00:58:17,700 --> 00:58:19,200
- Didn't you know?
- He asks if it's an English word.

1717
00:58:19,200 --> 00:58:20,470
My goodness.

1718
00:58:20,470 --> 00:58:22,680
When you say it's ironic...

1719
00:58:22,680 --> 00:58:24,320
- Do you know what's strange?
- Do Won...

1720
00:58:24,320 --> 00:58:25,410
I don't know who the criminals are.

1721
00:58:25,410 --> 00:58:28,120
I have a hunch.

1722
00:58:28,220 --> 00:58:29,510
Dae Myeung is strange.

1723
00:58:29,510 --> 00:58:30,820
Is Dae Myeung strange?

1724
00:58:30,820 --> 00:58:31,950
Dae Myeung is strange.

1725
00:58:31,950 --> 00:58:33,950
- He is strange.
- Dae Myeung is strange.

1726
00:58:33,950 --> 00:58:37,120
I think he has a different agenda.

1727
00:58:37,120 --> 00:58:39,390
- Yes. He is a bit different.
- I am a civilian,

1728
00:58:39,390 --> 00:58:40,700
but he seems to be looking
for something different.

1729
00:58:40,700 --> 00:58:42,100
He could be something else.

1730
00:58:42,100 --> 00:58:43,700
For example, if he's a civilian...

1731
00:58:43,740 --> 00:58:44,870
just like me,

1732
00:58:44,870 --> 00:58:47,640
he would feel lonely,
so he would talk to the others.

1733
00:58:47,700 --> 00:58:49,680
But he seemed to try to
stay away from others.

1734
00:58:49,780 --> 00:58:51,640
- He must have his own mission.
- Exactly.

1735
00:58:51,640 --> 00:58:53,600
He and I were alone together
in this building.

1736
00:58:53,600 --> 00:58:55,370
- He had to find something.
- Exactly.

1737
00:58:55,970 --> 00:58:57,950
- He's suspicious.
- Somehow, he seems...

1738
00:58:57,950 --> 00:58:59,450
- Kwang Soo.
- Why are you acting weird?

1739
00:58:59,450 --> 00:59:01,620
Kwang Soo, make up your mind
whether to swallow saliva or...

1740
00:59:02,490 --> 00:59:04,680
- I can tell it's in his mouth.
- My gosh.

1741
00:59:05,260 --> 00:59:08,450
(Kwang Soo can't seem to swallow
saliva maybe because he's nervous.)

1742
00:59:08,450 --> 00:59:09,600
- I can tell...
- But...

1743
00:59:09,600 --> 00:59:11,370
Can't I do whatever I want
with my saliva?

1744
00:59:11,370 --> 00:59:12,530
What's with you?

1745
00:59:12,700 --> 00:59:14,340
I wanted to...

1746
00:59:14,600 --> 00:59:16,470
I wanted to play with it
in my mouth.

1747
00:59:16,570 --> 00:59:17,700
Why would he...

1748
00:59:17,700 --> 00:59:20,240
- I wanted to play with it.
- But why...

1749
00:59:20,470 --> 00:59:21,840
(Laughing loudly)

1750
00:59:22,340 --> 00:59:23,780
(Laughing loudly)

1751
00:59:24,140 --> 00:59:26,240
(Laughing hard)

1752
00:59:26,570 --> 00:59:28,620
(He's laughing so hard
that he can't breathe.)

1753
00:59:28,620 --> 00:59:29,950
My, this is hilarious.

1754
00:59:30,050 --> 00:59:32,280
My stomach hurts. Oh, my stomach.

1755
00:59:33,640 --> 00:59:34,820
(Laughing)

1756
00:59:36,680 --> 00:59:38,030
Hey, Do Won.

1757
00:59:38,160 --> 00:59:39,530
What's so funny?

1758
00:59:40,550 --> 00:59:42,490
- What's with him?
- Hang on a second.

1759
00:59:42,490 --> 00:59:44,760
- Are you done?
- Is laughing like that weirder?

1760
00:59:44,760 --> 00:59:46,970
- Or not swallowing saliva weirder?
- What...

1761
00:59:47,160 --> 00:59:51,010
- What is wrong with him?
- Who are you to tell me what to do?

1762
00:59:51,100 --> 00:59:53,100
- It's my saliva.
- What's wrong with Do Won?

1763
00:59:53,260 --> 00:59:56,300
- Swallow it or spit it out,
- It's hilarious.

1764
00:59:56,410 --> 00:59:58,180
- it's my decision to make.
- They're so funny.

1765
00:59:58,180 --> 01:00:00,640
- Do Won, are you...
- Because you were looking at me...

1766
01:00:00,870 --> 01:00:02,950
(Laughing quietly)

1767
01:00:03,570 --> 01:00:06,050
(While Do Won is laughing so hard
that he cries...)

1768
01:00:06,740 --> 01:00:09,620
- How did you...
- I wanted to play with my saliva.

1769
01:00:09,620 --> 01:00:11,530
- Hey, you. Dae Myeung.
- You don't have to explain it.

1770
01:00:11,890 --> 01:00:14,350
- Why aren't you laughing?
- What?

1771
01:00:14,350 --> 01:00:15,950
(He got caught.)

1772
01:00:15,950 --> 01:00:18,070
- He rarely laughs.
- Why aren't you laughing?

1773
01:00:18,070 --> 01:00:20,030
(The man who can't laugh next to
the man who can't stop laughing)

1774
01:00:20,030 --> 01:00:21,430
Why won't he laugh?

1775
01:00:21,700 --> 01:00:22,800
I just... It's not like that.

1776
01:00:22,800 --> 01:00:24,840
- He can't laugh.
- Why won't he laugh?

1777
01:00:24,840 --> 01:00:26,010
Seriously, why won't he laugh?

1778
01:00:26,100 --> 01:00:27,970
It's not that I couldn't swallow it.
I didn't swallow it.

1779
01:00:27,970 --> 01:00:29,140
(The man who keeps laughing,
the man who can't swallow saliva,)

1780
01:00:29,140 --> 01:00:30,200
(the man who can't laugh)

1781
01:00:30,570 --> 01:00:32,100
Does saliva matter now?

1782
01:00:33,370 --> 01:00:35,870
- It has nothing to do with this.
- Is that so?

1783
01:00:35,870 --> 01:00:37,950
- My goodness.
- It's weird whether you laugh hard,

1784
01:00:37,950 --> 01:00:39,320
- or not laugh at all.
- Exactly.

1785
01:00:39,320 --> 01:00:41,590
- Exactly.
- Everyone is weird all of a sudden.

1786
01:00:42,180 --> 01:00:43,820
Here's a thought.
It's just my opinion.

1787
01:00:43,820 --> 01:00:44,990
(Kwang Soo suggests his opinion
to find the criminal.)

1788
01:00:44,990 --> 01:00:47,300
Do Won said the names of those
who are not the criminal...

1789
01:00:47,950 --> 01:00:50,970
- loudly enough for us all to hear.
- Yes, he did.

1790
01:00:51,070 --> 01:00:52,570
- You all heard him, right?
- Yes.

1791
01:00:52,570 --> 01:00:53,660
That means...

1792
01:00:53,840 --> 01:00:55,430
he's either a police officer
or a civilian.

1793
01:00:55,870 --> 01:00:57,140
Because he said it loudly.

1794
01:00:57,600 --> 01:00:59,570
However, that might've been
his intention.

1795
01:00:59,570 --> 01:01:00,680
- What did you say?
- What was that?

1796
01:01:01,340 --> 01:01:03,180
(He pronounced a word strangely.)

1797
01:01:03,780 --> 01:01:05,100
- What does that mean?
- What's with your pronunciation?

1798
01:01:05,510 --> 01:01:06,780
- Why did you say it like that?
- What did you say?

1799
01:01:06,780 --> 01:01:08,140
- He did it on purpose...
- What did you say again?

1800
01:01:08,140 --> 01:01:09,280
I think...

1801
01:01:09,410 --> 01:01:10,990
- Your lips...
- Your mouth is dry.

1802
01:01:10,990 --> 01:01:13,320
stuck to the teeth
because your mouth was dry.

1803
01:01:14,010 --> 01:01:16,510
If you'd had enough saliva,
you would've pronounced it properly.

1804
01:01:16,510 --> 01:01:18,160
- Repeat after me.
- We found the criminal too soon.

1805
01:01:19,620 --> 01:01:21,300
This is crazy.
Has everyone picked me?

1806
01:01:21,530 --> 01:01:23,260
- No, it's not like that.
- We were just discussing.

1807
01:01:23,260 --> 01:01:24,620
- We should put it to a vote.
- Then...

1808
01:01:24,970 --> 01:01:27,890
- I'll show you something...
- That's true, but...

1809
01:01:27,890 --> 01:01:30,340
- Those two are not the criminal.
- Kwang Soo will show us something.

1810
01:01:30,340 --> 01:01:32,010
I won't show it to all of you.

1811
01:01:32,010 --> 01:01:33,070
- Really?
- What is it?

1812
01:01:33,070 --> 01:01:34,930
- I think he has a big hint.
- A big hint?

1813
01:01:34,930 --> 01:01:35,970
Wait.

1814
01:01:35,970 --> 01:01:37,070
Then Ji Hyo and...

1815
01:01:37,070 --> 01:01:40,620
(What will Kwang Soo show everyone
when they're suspecting him?)

1816
01:01:41,370 --> 01:01:43,320
- What? He has a lot.
- How did he find so many?

1817
01:01:43,820 --> 01:01:45,280
(He has so many name tags.)

1818
01:01:45,280 --> 01:01:46,450
He has a lot.

1819
01:01:46,890 --> 01:01:47,990
My gosh.

1820
01:01:48,090 --> 01:01:50,260
- How?
- Why do you have so many of them?

1821
01:01:50,260 --> 01:01:51,990
- I bet those are blank.
- I...

1822
01:01:52,720 --> 01:01:54,430
- I'm 100 percent sure.
- I know...

1823
01:01:54,760 --> 01:01:56,030
- You know what?
- This is the one I gave you.

1824
01:01:56,300 --> 01:01:58,620
- But I couldn't find any.
- "Kwak Do Won". What's this?

1825
01:01:58,720 --> 01:02:02,570
- And who else?
- I already visited there.

1826
01:02:02,570 --> 01:02:03,760
- What?
- Really?

1827
01:02:03,870 --> 01:02:05,240
- You visited the Detective Agency?
- Yes, I did.

1828
01:02:05,240 --> 01:02:06,340
(He already the Detective Agency?)

1829
01:02:06,410 --> 01:02:08,410
- That doesn't make sense.
- How did he get so many...

1830
01:02:08,410 --> 01:02:10,340
- He found so many of them alone.
- I visited there.

1831
01:02:10,340 --> 01:02:11,470
- It's Dae Myeung's.
- Whose are they?

1832
01:02:11,870 --> 01:02:13,450
(He got everyone's attention.)

1833
01:02:13,450 --> 01:02:15,140
Wait. It's Dae Myeung's.
You found all of these?

1834
01:02:15,140 --> 01:02:16,640
- Did you use them?
- That's Suk Jin's.

1835
01:02:16,640 --> 01:02:17,890
- I visited there.
- Is it true?

1836
01:02:17,890 --> 01:02:18,990
- Yes.
- Which Detective Agency...

1837
01:02:19,450 --> 01:02:24,430
- Then why wasn't it announced?
- That's a good point.

1838
01:02:24,430 --> 01:02:25,780
That's a good point. That's odd.

1839
01:02:26,030 --> 01:02:27,390
- You brat.
- He's lying.

1840
01:02:27,390 --> 01:02:30,120
(The result would've been announced
if he had been there.)

1841
01:02:30,120 --> 01:02:31,200
Gosh. He lied again.

1842
01:02:31,200 --> 01:02:32,430
- You brat.
- He's lying.

1843
01:02:34,100 --> 01:02:35,140
(Ji Hyo pointed out
an important fact.)

1844
01:02:35,140 --> 01:02:36,390
Gosh. He lied again.

1845
01:02:36,390 --> 01:02:37,760
He must have brought...

1846
01:02:37,760 --> 01:02:39,410
the used ones.

1847
01:02:39,410 --> 01:02:42,030
- I wish we'd heard him out.
- This is unbelievable.

1848
01:02:42,030 --> 01:02:44,300
- He stole them from the staff.
- You should give him...

1849
01:02:44,300 --> 01:02:45,970
- We should've heard him out.
- It wasn't announced.

1850
01:02:45,970 --> 01:02:47,550
- All right. Okay.
- How could he...

1851
01:02:47,720 --> 01:02:49,220
- He lied.
- Okay. I admit it.

1852
01:02:49,220 --> 01:02:50,850
- I admit it.
- That was close.

1853
01:02:51,140 --> 01:02:52,350
Hear me out.

1854
01:02:52,550 --> 01:02:54,120
- These...
- One.

1855
01:02:54,120 --> 01:02:55,550
- You're right.
- Two.

1856
01:02:55,550 --> 01:02:56,720
- I stole these at the office.
- Three.

1857
01:02:56,850 --> 01:02:58,320
- Right? I was right about that.
- Yes.

1858
01:02:58,350 --> 01:03:01,030
- I found them in a big bag.
- Hey.

1859
01:03:02,950 --> 01:03:05,700
(Earlier on, Kwang Soo was
looking for a hint.)

1860
01:03:05,700 --> 01:03:06,800
(Rummaging)

1861
01:03:08,490 --> 01:03:11,200
(He found the name tags
in the staff's bag.)

1862
01:03:11,430 --> 01:03:13,700
(His criminal instinct kicked in.)

1863
01:03:14,510 --> 01:03:17,570
(He made fake hints
in a dishonest way.)

1864
01:03:18,850 --> 01:03:22,820
(Kwang Soo, the petty offender,
left after making fake hints.)

1865
01:03:24,090 --> 01:03:25,390
I cut them
and put them in the envelopes.

1866
01:03:25,390 --> 01:03:27,490
- These are fake.
- Did you know this?

1867
01:03:27,490 --> 01:03:29,120
- This is...
- They're fake.

1868
01:03:29,120 --> 01:03:30,780
- Why did you do that?
- Exactly. Why did you do that?

1869
01:03:30,780 --> 01:03:32,260
It looked like you were going to
narrow it down to me.

1870
01:03:32,260 --> 01:03:34,300
I did it to prove that I'm not.

1871
01:03:34,300 --> 01:03:37,220
He pronounced the word strangely
because he was nervous.

1872
01:03:37,220 --> 01:03:38,390
(Was it because he was nervous?)

1873
01:03:40,160 --> 01:03:42,240
- "I was cornered..."
- It doesn't mean...

1874
01:03:42,300 --> 01:03:43,700
that I'm the criminal.

1875
01:03:43,700 --> 01:03:44,760
That's enough!

1876
01:03:45,870 --> 01:03:48,180
(He even used violence in the end.)

1877
01:03:48,180 --> 01:03:49,470
It's not because I'm the criminal!

1878
01:03:50,430 --> 01:03:51,600
He's the criminal.

1879
01:03:51,950 --> 01:03:53,200
He just proved it.

1880
01:03:53,850 --> 01:03:55,010
My goodness.

1881
01:03:55,010 --> 01:03:56,640
- Listen.
- It's over.

1882
01:03:56,640 --> 01:03:58,280
- But...
- Hey.

1883
01:03:58,490 --> 01:04:00,590
We must eliminate him even if
he's a civilian. Do you know why?

1884
01:04:00,590 --> 01:04:02,350
- He confuses us.
- Absolutely. He's weird.

1885
01:04:02,590 --> 01:04:04,030
- Wait.
- We must eliminate him.

1886
01:04:04,120 --> 01:04:05,620
Let's start the voting.

1887
01:04:05,620 --> 01:04:10,390
The person who gets the most votes
will be revealed and out right away.

1888
01:04:10,870 --> 01:04:13,300
- Goodbye, Kwang Soo.
- Why would he show us that?

1889
01:04:13,300 --> 01:04:15,300
We have no choice.

1890
01:04:15,840 --> 01:04:17,100
But Kwang Soo...

1891
01:04:17,100 --> 01:04:18,530
Whenever we do things like this...

1892
01:04:18,530 --> 01:04:19,870
- But you know...
- Wait.

1893
01:04:19,870 --> 01:04:22,140
Let me say something
for the last time.

1894
01:04:22,140 --> 01:04:23,430
But we all voted already.

1895
01:04:24,010 --> 01:04:25,410
Why were you so impatient?

1896
01:04:25,740 --> 01:04:27,070
Why didn't you hear me out?

1897
01:04:27,180 --> 01:04:29,370
- Tell us why you're not.
- I'll tell you.

1898
01:04:29,410 --> 01:04:30,740
Tell us something that's true.

1899
01:04:30,740 --> 01:04:31,910
I am...

1900
01:04:31,910 --> 01:04:34,490
(He barely got the chance
to defend himself.)

1901
01:04:34,490 --> 01:04:38,660
(Will he say something
that can convince them this time?)

1902
01:04:39,890 --> 01:04:40,990
the police officer.

1903
01:04:40,990 --> 01:04:43,260
(I am the police officer.)

1904
01:04:44,030 --> 01:04:45,660
(Kwang Soo is...)

1905
01:04:45,660 --> 01:04:49,490
(the police officer?)

1906
01:04:49,490 --> 01:04:50,660
Gosh, that's ridiculous.

1907
01:04:50,660 --> 01:04:54,300
(Gosh, that's ridiculous.)

1908
01:04:54,780 --> 01:04:55,970
Well, I'm going to...

1909
01:04:56,100 --> 01:04:57,680
I'll go out to find the next one.

1910
01:04:57,680 --> 01:04:58,970
(Ridiculous?)

1911
01:04:59,410 --> 01:05:00,870
I'll go out to find the next one.

1912
01:05:00,870 --> 01:05:02,240
(It's not worth hearing.)

1913
01:05:02,370 --> 01:05:04,550
I'll just... I'll go out...

1914
01:05:05,180 --> 01:05:06,720
- Wait.
- I'll go out to find the next one.

1915
01:05:06,720 --> 01:05:08,490
Is he really the police officer?

1916
01:05:08,760 --> 01:05:10,410
- I am the police officer.
- Is he?

1917
01:05:10,450 --> 01:05:11,530
I'm the police officer.

1918
01:05:11,530 --> 01:05:13,530
If I get eliminated,

1919
01:05:13,660 --> 01:05:15,930
- and if I'm the police officer...
- Yes. Who?

1920
01:05:16,760 --> 01:05:18,820
(While claiming that he's
the police officer to the end,)

1921
01:05:18,820 --> 01:05:20,030
You think it's Haha?

1922
01:05:20,030 --> 01:05:21,390
(he picked
the most suspicious person.)

1923
01:05:21,470 --> 01:05:23,570
(He picked Haha.)

1924
01:05:23,570 --> 01:05:24,800
It's your last word.

1925
01:05:25,240 --> 01:05:26,510
- Okay. I get it.
- If I'm the police officer...

1926
01:05:26,510 --> 01:05:29,300
I have 2 name tags. If anyone also
has 2, let's submit them together.

1927
01:05:29,470 --> 01:05:30,950
Let's go straight to
the Detective Agency.

1928
01:05:31,070 --> 01:05:33,300
- I have one too.
- Let's go together.

1929
01:05:33,510 --> 01:05:35,550
I'm so curious if that's true.

1930
01:05:35,820 --> 01:05:37,780
- If it's true, I'd be shocked.
- Right?

1931
01:05:38,090 --> 01:05:39,890
- The result came out.
- Okay.

1932
01:05:39,990 --> 01:05:41,890
I'll announce the result of
the first interrogation.

1933
01:05:41,990 --> 01:05:44,780
- Kwang Soo got the most votes.
- I knew it.

1934
01:05:45,120 --> 01:05:46,620
- Kwang Soo...
- Did everyone vote for me?

1935
01:05:46,660 --> 01:05:48,200
- Tell us his identity.
- I can't tell you that.

1936
01:05:48,930 --> 01:05:50,430
Can someone take off...

1937
01:05:50,430 --> 01:05:53,030
- His name tag?
- his name tag? Please stand here.

1938
01:05:53,030 --> 01:05:54,490
I'll be shocked
if he's the police officer.

1939
01:05:55,100 --> 01:05:56,760
What happens
if he's the police officer?

1940
01:05:56,760 --> 01:05:58,070
We'll have to start over again.

1941
01:05:58,530 --> 01:06:00,010
- He's definitely the criminal.
- Just remember this.

1942
01:06:00,010 --> 01:06:01,970
- Those who suspected me...
- Never.

1943
01:06:02,640 --> 01:06:03,780
One.

1944
01:06:03,780 --> 01:06:05,370
(Kwang Soo claimed
he's the police officer at the end.)

1945
01:06:05,370 --> 01:06:06,450
Two.

1946
01:06:06,450 --> 01:06:10,010
(What could be his real identity?)

1947
01:06:13,620 --> 01:06:15,410
(Police Officer)

1948
01:06:15,410 --> 01:06:17,320
(He's the police officer.)

1949
01:06:19,180 --> 01:06:21,220
(Unbelievable!)

1950
01:06:25,200 --> 01:06:28,430
(The newcomer Dae Myeung's
senior police officer was...)

1951
01:06:28,430 --> 01:06:31,370
(Kwang Soo.)

1952
01:06:35,970 --> 01:06:37,700
(Kicking)

1953
01:06:38,100 --> 01:06:40,050
(He really is a police officer.)

1954
01:06:40,910 --> 01:06:42,470
You should have told us sooner.

1955
01:06:42,470 --> 01:06:43,620
(I told you
I was the police officer!)

1956
01:06:43,620 --> 01:06:45,550
- You should've told us sooner.
- Jae Suk is suspicious too.

1957
01:06:45,680 --> 01:06:48,680
- Why didn't you tell us?
- Why didn't you, you fool?

1958
01:06:48,680 --> 01:06:49,780
The criminal...

1959
01:06:49,780 --> 01:06:51,660
- Did you ask why didn't I tell you?
- I mean, if you were...

1960
01:06:51,660 --> 01:06:54,200
- I told you that and showed you...
- This is shocking.

1961
01:06:55,990 --> 01:06:58,200
You two are junior and senior
police officers.

1962
01:06:58,200 --> 01:07:00,100
(He worked undercover
with Dae Myeung.)

1963
01:07:01,370 --> 01:07:02,470
Did you find any?

1964
01:07:02,760 --> 01:07:04,140
- Did you find any?
- No.

1965
01:07:05,070 --> 01:07:06,600
I found one, but my name was on it.

1966
01:07:06,600 --> 01:07:07,740
- Really?
- Yes.

1967
01:07:07,840 --> 01:07:09,700
If you find mine, tell everyone.

1968
01:07:10,070 --> 01:07:12,950
- I won't tell anyone...
- You should tell everyone.

1969
01:07:12,950 --> 01:07:15,550
(Unlike how he led the team,)

1970
01:07:15,550 --> 01:07:18,320
(he was picked as the criminal.)

1971
01:07:18,850 --> 01:07:21,950
(Dae Myeung looked away from him.)

1972
01:07:23,050 --> 01:07:26,320
(Dae Myeung,
why aren't you laughing?)

1973
01:07:26,660 --> 01:07:28,220
(Awkward)

1974
01:07:28,660 --> 01:07:31,760
(Dae Myeung lacked experience
as a newcomer police officer.)

1975
01:07:31,760 --> 01:07:36,390
(He turned a blind eye to him
to avoid being suspected.)

1976
01:07:36,390 --> 01:07:37,700
- You should've told us that.
- You should've told us sooner.

1977
01:07:37,700 --> 01:07:39,840
But I don't know
who the criminals are.

1978
01:07:39,840 --> 01:07:41,870
- You should've told us sooner.
- There would've been someone...

1979
01:07:41,870 --> 01:07:43,680
- who tried to save you.
- Exactly.

1980
01:07:43,680 --> 01:07:45,640
- You should've told us that first.
- But I don't know who they are.

1981
01:07:45,640 --> 01:07:47,620
- We would've...
- You should have worked...

1982
01:07:47,620 --> 01:07:50,570
- with Ji Hyo who is a civilian.
- You should've told us.

1983
01:07:50,570 --> 01:07:51,890
But she wouldn't believe me.

1984
01:07:51,890 --> 01:07:53,410
- Exactly. You should've told us.
- Instead, you lied to us.

1985
01:07:53,410 --> 01:07:55,950
- Why did you show us the name tags?
- Exactly.

1986
01:07:55,950 --> 01:07:57,550
- That was totally pointless.
- Indeed.

1987
01:07:57,550 --> 01:07:59,350
You were all suspecting me
from the start.

1988
01:07:59,350 --> 01:08:01,390
- We're in trouble.
- Gosh, seriously.

1989
01:08:01,930 --> 01:08:03,550
Haha does seem anxious right now.

1990
01:08:03,550 --> 01:08:06,300
No. I... I'm confident.

1991
01:08:07,160 --> 01:08:08,870
(Who could be the two criminals?)

1992
01:08:08,870 --> 01:08:10,470
We should find them quickly.
We're in trouble.

1993
01:08:11,530 --> 01:08:14,410
(The police officer is out.)

1994
01:08:14,740 --> 01:08:17,010
(1 of the 3 of them is
1 of the criminals.)

1995
01:08:17,010 --> 01:08:18,950
The first interrogation session
is over.

1996
01:08:18,950 --> 01:08:20,950
Now, we'll begin the 2nd session
in 30 minutes.

1997
01:08:21,870 --> 01:08:24,140
- Dae Myeung is suspicious.
- Yes?

1998
01:08:24,140 --> 01:08:25,510
(They are trying to find out
who the criminals are.)

1999
01:08:25,510 --> 01:08:27,350
His behaviors were suspicious.

2000
01:08:27,720 --> 01:08:29,310
As if he was afraid
we might found out about him...

2001
01:08:29,310 --> 01:08:31,690
I know he had his own strategy,

2002
01:08:31,690 --> 01:08:34,090
- but it was too obvious.
- A criminal or police officer.

2003
01:08:34,090 --> 01:08:35,450
- He's either one of them.
- He must be a criminal.

2004
01:08:35,450 --> 01:08:36,760
- A criminal?
- Yes, he's a criminal.

2005
01:08:37,300 --> 01:08:40,690
Do Won is suspicious too.
He does laugh loudly like he did.

2006
01:08:40,690 --> 01:08:43,490
- I know.
- But his reactions are too loud.

2007
01:08:43,490 --> 01:08:44,900
We already know
one of the police officers,

2008
01:08:44,900 --> 01:08:46,400
so there's a higher chance
of him being a criminal.

2009
01:08:46,400 --> 01:08:47,570
That's what I'm saying.

2010
01:08:50,180 --> 01:08:52,610
(Meanwhile, Kwang Soo is moving
to the jail.)

2011
01:08:55,810 --> 01:08:57,310
I had no choice.

2012
01:08:58,650 --> 01:09:01,560
I'm okay with everything else,
but I was most hurt...

2013
01:09:01,690 --> 01:09:03,950
when you ignored me
when I looked at you.

2014
01:09:04,020 --> 01:09:08,100
I thought that if I sympathized
with you at that moment,

2015
01:09:08,100 --> 01:09:09,560
- we would both die.
- I understand.

2016
01:09:09,560 --> 01:09:11,560
But I kept looking at you.

2017
01:09:11,560 --> 01:09:12,730
I will succeed no matter what.

2018
01:09:12,730 --> 01:09:14,560
I kept looking at you,
but you turned away.

2019
01:09:14,560 --> 01:09:15,690
(He cut ties with him
when they locked eyes.)

2020
01:09:15,690 --> 01:09:16,900
That's what you did.

2021
01:09:17,160 --> 01:09:18,730
(They got further away
from each other.)

2022
01:09:18,730 --> 01:09:20,810
But if you win,

2023
01:09:21,570 --> 01:09:23,400
- we both win.
- Okay.

2024
01:09:23,400 --> 01:09:24,480
Catch them no matter what.

2025
01:09:24,480 --> 01:09:25,940
(Dae Myeung must find
the 2 criminals...)

2026
01:09:25,940 --> 01:09:27,400
(for the citizens
and police officers to win.)

2027
01:09:28,110 --> 01:09:29,180
Is it still like that?

2028
01:09:29,180 --> 01:09:30,550
(The police officer, Dae Myeung,
looks for someone.)

2029
01:09:30,740 --> 01:09:32,220
- Hey, Jong Kook.
- All of a sudden...

2030
01:09:32,220 --> 01:09:33,310
(He has a rendezvous with
Ji Hyo, who's definitely a citizen.)

2031
01:09:33,310 --> 01:09:35,060
- I have this.
- Right.

2032
01:09:35,060 --> 01:09:38,360
I'm actually a police officer.

2033
01:09:38,390 --> 01:09:39,760
Please help me.

2034
01:09:39,820 --> 01:09:41,230
Really?

2035
01:09:41,230 --> 01:09:42,300
(The lone rookie officer begins
to win over the citizens.)

2036
01:09:42,300 --> 01:09:43,520
(He plans to find the criminals
by working with the citizens.)

2037
01:09:43,520 --> 01:09:44,560
Okay.

2038
01:09:45,270 --> 01:09:46,270
Okay.

2039
01:09:47,800 --> 01:09:50,440
(The prime suspect, Do Won,
appears at that moment.)

2040
01:09:50,470 --> 01:09:52,700
- Did you find anything?
- No. I didn't.

2041
01:09:52,730 --> 01:09:54,440
You're a criminal, right?
You punk.

2042
01:09:54,440 --> 01:09:55,440
No, I'm not.

2043
01:09:55,440 --> 01:09:56,610
You're the criminal, right?

2044
01:09:56,610 --> 01:09:57,650
No, I'm not.

2045
01:09:57,700 --> 01:09:59,270
Are you a police officer then?

2046
01:09:59,270 --> 01:10:00,370
I'm a citizen.

2047
01:10:00,480 --> 01:10:01,680
He's a citizen.

2048
01:10:01,940 --> 01:10:04,070
- Did you find anything?
- I didn't find a single thing.

2049
01:10:04,070 --> 01:10:05,280
I need to find something.

2050
01:10:05,280 --> 01:10:06,410
(Thanks to Ji Hyo,
the conversation ends naturally.)

2051
01:10:07,590 --> 01:10:09,310
(Sighing)

2052
01:10:09,310 --> 01:10:10,560
It's not him.

2053
01:10:10,560 --> 01:10:12,590
(It's not him.)

2054
01:10:14,230 --> 01:10:15,800
I should find them quickly.

2055
01:10:15,860 --> 01:10:17,770
- What?
- What? Did you find something?

2056
01:10:17,800 --> 01:10:18,970
You surprised me.

2057
01:10:19,120 --> 01:10:20,690
- Do Won.
- I heard someone laugh.

2058
01:10:20,690 --> 01:10:23,860
I don't know if we're looking
for the same thing, Do Won.

2059
01:10:25,730 --> 01:10:27,310
(Full of suspicion)

2060
01:10:27,310 --> 01:10:30,640
So Min! The look in your eyes
has changed.

2061
01:10:31,350 --> 01:10:33,610
(Do Won became the prime suspect
after the first interrogation.)

2062
01:10:33,610 --> 01:10:37,270
If that's the case,
why would I give you the hint?

2063
01:10:37,410 --> 01:10:39,110
None of you knew it.

2064
01:10:39,220 --> 01:10:41,410
Why would I tell you
who the two citizens were?

2065
01:10:41,760 --> 01:10:43,590
- Why did you?
- Why did you?

2066
01:10:43,590 --> 01:10:45,320
It's because you're the criminal,
you punk.

2067
01:10:45,620 --> 01:10:47,320
Do Won.

2068
01:10:49,860 --> 01:10:53,660
- You're good at cornering people.
- No, I'm not.

2069
01:10:53,660 --> 01:10:55,300
(The two prime suspects, Haha
and Do Won, have a battle of wits.)

2070
01:10:55,300 --> 01:10:56,730
You're incredible.

2071
01:10:57,700 --> 01:10:59,470
(Meanwhile, Jae Suk is...)

2072
01:10:59,840 --> 01:11:01,180
Why do I find you to be
so suspicious?

2073
01:11:01,180 --> 01:11:02,180
Come on, Sang Ho.

2074
01:11:02,700 --> 01:11:04,510
- There's nothing to suspect.
- Sang Ho.

2075
01:11:05,680 --> 01:11:06,900
Come over here.

2076
01:11:06,900 --> 01:11:08,180
- I'm sorry.
- You're hurting my feelings.

2077
01:11:08,180 --> 01:11:09,240
Jae Suk.

2078
01:11:09,240 --> 01:11:11,650
- How could you do that...
- I'm sorry, Jae Suk.

2079
01:11:11,650 --> 01:11:12,890
- I'm sorry, Jae Suk.
- My gosh.

2080
01:11:12,890 --> 01:11:14,950
(Ji Hyo left Jae Suk out
and brought Sang Ho with her.)

2081
01:11:15,190 --> 01:11:17,190
- Dae Myeung is...
- Yes?

2082
01:11:18,190 --> 01:11:19,320
a police officer.

2083
01:11:19,320 --> 01:11:20,560
He's a police officer?

2084
01:11:20,590 --> 01:11:22,600
That's why
he didn't say anything earlier.

2085
01:11:22,600 --> 01:11:24,600
That's why he didn't say anything
since before.

2086
01:11:24,900 --> 01:11:28,300
(The rookie police officer is busy
looking for name tags.)

2087
01:11:33,510 --> 01:11:36,640
(He finds a name tag.)

2088
01:11:38,870 --> 01:11:40,900
(He got Ji Hyo's name tag.)

2089
01:11:42,550 --> 01:11:45,610
(He even found Jae Suk's name tag.)

2090
01:11:45,610 --> 01:11:46,740
(Yoo Jae Suk)

2091
01:11:47,410 --> 01:11:50,650
(Including Haha's name tag,
he has 3 name tags.)

2092
01:11:52,450 --> 01:11:55,100
(He looks around...)

2093
01:11:55,100 --> 01:11:58,020
(and enters the Detective Agency.)

2094
01:11:59,690 --> 01:12:01,770
(At that moment!)

2095
01:12:03,800 --> 01:12:07,060
(Do Won spots Dae Myeung going in.)

2096
01:12:08,180 --> 01:12:12,050
(Dae Myeung doesn't know
Do Won saw him and enters.)

2097
01:12:14,350 --> 01:12:15,680
Let me check.

2098
01:12:15,680 --> 01:12:16,810
(He needs 4 name tags to check.)

2099
01:12:19,810 --> 01:12:22,280
(He submits the name tag
and the seasoned salt.)

2100
01:12:22,810 --> 01:12:24,110
The name of the salt is...

2101
01:12:25,730 --> 01:12:27,480
Kim Dae Myeung.

2102
01:12:27,480 --> 01:12:28,520
(He exchanges it with
his own name tag.)

2103
01:12:29,490 --> 01:12:31,470
(He submits the name tags of
a police officer and a citizen...)

2104
01:12:31,470 --> 01:12:37,030
(as well as the name tags of
2 prime suspects.)

2105
01:12:38,640 --> 01:12:40,770
(1. If there are more criminals,
Haha and Jae Seo are criminals.)

2106
01:12:40,770 --> 01:12:42,640
(2. If there are
more police officers,)

2107
01:12:42,640 --> 01:12:45,070
(Haha and Jae Suk are citizens.)

2108
01:12:45,070 --> 01:12:48,680
(If there are equivalent, either
Haha or Jae Suk is a criminal.)

2109
01:12:49,850 --> 01:12:52,440
(What are the results
from the Detective Agency?)

2110
01:12:52,440 --> 01:12:54,190
(The number of criminals
and police officers is the same?)

2111
01:12:55,280 --> 01:12:57,820
(As a result,)

2112
01:12:57,820 --> 01:13:00,780
(1 of these 2 is a criminal.)

2113
01:13:02,300 --> 01:13:04,660
(Dae Myeung found out
from the Detective Agency that...)

2114
01:13:04,660 --> 01:13:07,620
(either Haha or Jae Suk
is a criminal.)

2115
01:13:09,560 --> 01:13:11,310
According to the Detective Agency,

2116
01:13:11,310 --> 01:13:13,310
the number of criminals and
police officers is the same.

2117
01:13:14,200 --> 01:13:16,340
I wonder whose name tags
they submitted.

2118
01:13:16,400 --> 01:13:17,610
It's equivalent?

2119
01:13:21,980 --> 01:13:23,020
You submitted it just now, right?

2120
01:13:23,310 --> 01:13:24,590
You submitted it just now, right?

2121
01:13:25,240 --> 01:13:26,850
- They submitted it?
- They did.

2122
01:13:26,850 --> 01:13:28,280
But there was the same number.
We don't know who was submitted.

2123
01:13:28,280 --> 01:13:29,360
Is that so?

2124
01:13:29,360 --> 01:13:31,520
We need to find out though.

2125
01:13:31,650 --> 01:13:32,730
(They all move to find Dae Myeung.)

2126
01:13:32,730 --> 01:13:34,690
- Dae Myeung. Who did you submit?
- Dae Myeung.

2127
01:13:34,690 --> 01:13:35,800
Who did you submit?

2128
01:13:35,950 --> 01:13:38,100
- Dae Myeung.
- I didn't find any.

2129
01:13:38,160 --> 01:13:39,730
- We heard you submitted it.
- What do you mean?

2130
01:13:39,730 --> 01:13:41,120
- Everyone knows.
- There was an announcement.

2131
01:13:41,120 --> 01:13:42,770
Me? I didn't submit anything.

2132
01:13:42,770 --> 01:13:43,940
(He plays innocent.)

2133
01:13:45,200 --> 01:13:47,310
- Oh, my.
- Look at him.

2134
01:13:48,370 --> 01:13:50,230
(Dae Myeung lies out of haste
without figuring out the situation.)

2135
01:13:50,230 --> 01:13:51,570
There was an announcement.

2136
01:13:51,570 --> 01:13:55,110
If it was you
and the results came out,

2137
01:13:55,110 --> 01:13:56,910
- tell us who the citizens are.
- Share with us.

2138
01:13:56,910 --> 01:13:59,890
Tell someone who has been confirmed
as a citizen.

2139
01:13:59,890 --> 01:14:03,310
Tell someone like Ji Hyo or So Min.

2140
01:14:03,310 --> 01:14:05,820
I heard you submitted it.
How did you do it?

2141
01:14:06,520 --> 01:14:07,820
- Everyone knows.
- Dae Myeung is...

2142
01:14:07,820 --> 01:14:09,520
- I really didn't submit them.
- Dae Myeung was...

2143
01:14:09,520 --> 01:14:10,950
a bit scared,

2144
01:14:10,950 --> 01:14:13,300
- so I think he lied on a whim.
- He lied.

2145
01:14:13,300 --> 01:14:15,940
There was an announcement
that the number is equal.

2146
01:14:15,990 --> 01:14:18,640
Don't reveal everything, but just...

2147
01:14:18,640 --> 01:14:19,700
(One slip of the tongue
leads to Dae Myeung's crisis.)

2148
01:14:19,700 --> 01:14:21,700
- Tell a citizen. Tell Ji Hyo.
- Wait.

2149
01:14:21,700 --> 01:14:22,700
- Tell Ji Hyo.
- Tell Ji Hyo.

2150
01:14:22,700 --> 01:14:24,770
Tell Ji Hyo. Hurry.

2151
01:14:24,850 --> 01:14:25,940
Hurry up and go.

2152
01:14:25,940 --> 01:14:27,350
(Ripping)

2153
01:14:27,700 --> 01:14:28,770
Hurry up and go.

2154
01:14:28,770 --> 01:14:31,740
(What? He ripped off the name tag?)

2155
01:14:31,890 --> 01:14:32,980
What was that?

2156
01:14:33,150 --> 01:14:34,190
- What?
- What was that?

2157
01:14:34,190 --> 01:14:35,220
Hurry up and do it.

2158
01:14:35,220 --> 01:14:38,090
(Dae Myeung's attack happened
in a blink of an eye.)

2159
01:14:38,650 --> 01:14:41,430
(About 20 minutes ago,
during the first interrogation)

2160
01:14:42,300 --> 01:14:46,020
(Kwang Soo told Dae Myeung
that Haha was the criminal.)

2161
01:14:46,520 --> 01:14:49,360
(The Detective Agency results said
1 of these 3 was the criminal.)

2162
01:14:49,560 --> 01:14:52,640
(Kwang Soo said it was Haha.)

2163
01:14:53,310 --> 01:14:54,870
(If you see Haha,
rip off his name tag.)

2164
01:14:54,870 --> 01:14:59,010
(He decided to attack as a part of
his contingency plan.)

2165
01:15:00,050 --> 01:15:03,350
(He attacked the prime suspect,
Haha, in the time of crisis.)

2166
01:15:03,350 --> 01:15:06,090
(What is Haha's identity?)

2167
01:15:06,240 --> 01:15:07,310
What was that?

2168
01:15:07,780 --> 01:15:10,720
(Haha is a citizen.)

2169
01:15:10,720 --> 01:15:11,780
(What?)

2170
01:15:11,780 --> 01:15:13,360
(Why is he a citizen?)

2171
01:15:13,360 --> 01:15:14,360
What did you do?

2172
01:15:14,360 --> 01:15:15,650
- Why did he do that just now?
- He thought you were a criminal.

2173
01:15:15,650 --> 01:15:17,230
- He's a citizen.
- He's a citizen.

2174
01:15:17,230 --> 01:15:18,800
- He's a citizen.
- Why did you rip his name tag off?

2175
01:15:18,860 --> 01:15:20,800
- Why did he do that just now?
- He thought you were a criminal.

2176
01:15:20,800 --> 01:15:23,900
(Dae Myeung the police officer's
attack ended in failure.)

2177
01:15:24,060 --> 01:15:25,610
I told you.

2178
01:15:26,010 --> 01:15:27,160
You fool.

2179
01:15:27,160 --> 01:15:28,370
He was a citizen. Oh, no.

2180
01:15:28,370 --> 01:15:30,030
You should've discussed it first.

2181
01:15:30,030 --> 01:15:31,810
- Let's protect him.
- We had no idea.

2182
01:15:31,810 --> 01:15:32,870
- Then...
- Let's protect him.

2183
01:15:32,870 --> 01:15:34,550
We're in trouble because
he ripped off his name tag.

2184
01:15:34,550 --> 01:15:35,550
(According to the first results,
the remaining suspect is...)

2185
01:15:35,550 --> 01:15:36,550
Oh, my.

2186
01:15:36,550 --> 01:15:40,980
- Is it Suk Jin then?
- Okay.

2187
01:15:43,520 --> 01:15:46,120
(Suk Jin
eliminated Kim Dae Myeung.)

2188
01:15:46,120 --> 01:15:47,650
Is it Suk Jin then?

2189
01:15:47,650 --> 01:15:50,820
(Before Do Won could finish,
Suk Jin attacked Dae Myeung.)

2190
01:15:50,950 --> 01:15:52,730
Okay. Yes!

2191
01:15:53,160 --> 01:15:54,800
(Then...)

2192
01:15:54,800 --> 01:15:56,270
(Does that mean...)

2193
01:15:56,270 --> 01:15:57,640
- He doesn't know anything.
- You're a police officer.

2194
01:15:57,640 --> 01:15:58,700
Hold on.

2195
01:15:58,700 --> 01:16:00,030
- What is this?
- What is this?

2196
01:16:00,030 --> 01:16:01,480
- What is this?
- What is going on?

2197
01:16:01,900 --> 01:16:04,030
(The last police officer,
Kim Dae Myeung, is out.)

2198
01:16:05,110 --> 01:16:06,200
- What is this?
- What is going on?

2199
01:16:06,200 --> 01:16:08,980
(Nobody suspected him.)

2200
01:16:08,980 --> 01:16:10,270
- What?
- You are the criminal?

2201
01:16:10,270 --> 01:16:11,550
Are you the criminal?

2202
01:16:13,550 --> 01:16:14,980
Yes, I am.

2203
01:16:14,980 --> 01:16:16,220
(Ji Suk Jin, the criminal)

2204
01:16:16,360 --> 01:16:18,690
Last week, you had a big role...

2205
01:16:18,690 --> 01:16:20,590
- as the boss of Petty Gang,
- Right.

2206
01:16:20,590 --> 01:16:23,800
but you couldn't escape
and lost the race.

2207
01:16:24,060 --> 01:16:26,660
We'll give you a chance
to make up for it today.

2208
01:16:26,660 --> 01:16:28,030
(A chance for revenge came
after a week)

2209
01:16:28,030 --> 01:16:30,990
We thought it might be hard
for you to do it alone,

2210
01:16:30,990 --> 01:16:32,230
so we brought you
a right-hand man.

2211
01:16:32,230 --> 01:16:33,230
(Because it's a hard task
to do alone,)

2212
01:16:33,230 --> 01:16:34,230
(the right-hand man of
Petty Gang joins.)

2213
01:16:35,370 --> 01:16:37,110
(The right-hand man of Petty Gang,
Yoo Jae Suk)

2214
01:16:37,110 --> 01:16:39,110
- Hello.
- Come here.

2215
01:16:39,200 --> 01:16:41,550
- My right-hand man.
- He's a weakling.

2216
01:16:41,550 --> 01:16:42,870
- My right-hand man.
- This...

2217
01:16:42,910 --> 01:16:45,190
We're in trouble this week too.

2218
01:16:45,980 --> 01:16:47,810
The two of us can't do anything.

2219
01:16:47,810 --> 01:16:48,950
My right-hand man.

2220
01:16:48,950 --> 01:16:50,980
I'm not the type to be able
to work for someone.

2221
01:16:50,980 --> 01:16:52,560
I'm the boss of Petty Gang.

2222
01:16:52,560 --> 01:16:53,760
- Again?
- You're my right-hand man.

2223
01:16:53,760 --> 01:16:55,360
I made the Petty Gang,

2224
01:16:55,360 --> 01:16:57,120
but why is he the boss?

2225
01:16:57,150 --> 01:16:58,900
Today's results will determine...

2226
01:16:58,900 --> 01:17:01,530
whether or not we'll keep this...

2227
01:17:01,800 --> 01:17:04,140
- Petty Gang universe.
- Why would we keep it?

2228
01:17:04,140 --> 01:17:05,640
We should. Petty Gang is nice.

2229
01:17:05,640 --> 01:17:07,160
And it's nice for you
to be a right-hand man.

2230
01:17:07,160 --> 01:17:08,610
What's so nice about it?

2231
01:17:09,230 --> 01:17:11,480
I can't work for someone.

2232
01:17:11,480 --> 01:17:13,440
Don't think of it as working for me.
You're the next in line.

2233
01:17:13,440 --> 01:17:14,440
(The two criminals put the fate of
Petty Gang on the line.)

2234
01:17:14,700 --> 01:17:16,480
You can smuggle
in the seasoned salt by changing...

2235
01:17:16,480 --> 01:17:18,740
a real soccer ball with a ball
filled with seasoned salt.

2236
01:17:18,740 --> 01:17:20,390
- Then...
- Is it obvious which one it is?

2237
01:17:20,390 --> 01:17:21,450
Let's see.

2238
01:17:22,220 --> 01:17:24,110
We hope you are successful.

2239
01:17:24,110 --> 01:17:25,820
Okay. Don't worry.

2240
01:17:26,980 --> 01:17:30,100
(He complained, but he worked hard
as the right-hand man.)

2241
01:17:30,100 --> 01:17:32,190
(Jae Suk played a role in failing
at the group mission,)

2242
01:17:32,190 --> 01:17:34,320
(and prevented them
from getting hints.)

2243
01:17:34,520 --> 01:17:36,730
(Jae Suk, everyone is saying
that you're acting weird.)

2244
01:17:36,730 --> 01:17:39,900
(He escaped to a remote area
after his boss' warning.)

2245
01:17:39,900 --> 01:17:41,640
Even if I get eliminated,

2246
01:17:41,770 --> 01:17:44,070
it's okay because Suk Jin
has infiltrated them.

2247
01:17:44,680 --> 01:17:46,070
(You're not the criminal, right?)

2248
01:17:46,070 --> 01:17:47,850
(Sly)

2249
01:17:47,850 --> 01:17:49,180
(Boss Big Nose appeals...)

2250
01:17:49,180 --> 01:17:52,650
(to Do Won's kindness by saying
he had a role last week.)

2251
01:17:53,520 --> 01:17:57,860
(He gained everyone's trust and
survived by acting as a citizen.)

2252
01:17:58,390 --> 01:18:02,520
(Nobody suspected him, and they
involved him in their deductions.)

2253
01:18:03,760 --> 01:18:06,230
They're telling me everything.

2254
01:18:08,360 --> 01:18:09,690
There's something thrilling
about this.

2255
01:18:09,690 --> 01:18:11,560
(There's something thrilling
about this.)

2256
01:18:11,640 --> 01:18:12,940
He just said my name.

2257
01:18:12,940 --> 01:18:14,310
- Is this for real?
- What were you going to say?

2258
01:18:14,310 --> 01:18:15,480
No way.

2259
01:18:15,610 --> 01:18:17,030
What happened just now was...

2260
01:18:17,030 --> 01:18:19,400
I said, "Is it Suk Jin then?"

2261
01:18:19,400 --> 01:18:20,440
(The timing was amazing.)

2262
01:18:20,440 --> 01:18:22,270
That's why I ripped off
his name tag.

2263
01:18:22,650 --> 01:18:24,550
- This was so much fun.
- Why did you rip off Haha's?

2264
01:18:24,550 --> 01:18:25,890
- It was fun.
- It was fun.

2265
01:18:25,890 --> 01:18:28,610
Ji Suk Jin ripped off
Kim Dae Myeung's name tag,

2266
01:18:28,610 --> 01:18:29,890
so the criminals won.

2267
01:18:29,890 --> 01:18:31,690
(Amazing)

2268
01:18:32,090 --> 01:18:33,590
(Smiling from ear to ear)

2269
01:18:33,590 --> 01:18:35,060
(Suk Jin did it?)

2270
01:18:35,190 --> 01:18:36,860
I can't believe this happened.

2271
01:18:37,020 --> 01:18:38,430
I can't believe this happened.

2272
01:18:38,430 --> 01:18:39,690
(Not even the right-hand man
expected this from the boss.)

2273
01:18:39,690 --> 01:18:41,190
Suk Jin ripped off
Dae Myeung's name tag?

2274
01:18:41,600 --> 01:18:43,160
(The final mission is over.)

2275
01:18:43,160 --> 01:18:44,560
My gosh.

2276
01:18:44,560 --> 01:18:46,010
This is really fun.

2277
01:18:46,310 --> 01:18:47,970
We should've shared the information.

2278
01:18:47,970 --> 01:18:49,180
We should've shared it.

2279
01:18:49,180 --> 01:18:50,810
I didn't trust anyone.

2280
01:18:50,810 --> 01:18:52,240
- I can't believe this.
- Gosh.

2281
01:18:52,510 --> 01:18:54,510
- Yes!
- I should've helped him.

2282
01:18:54,680 --> 01:18:56,350
You know what?

2283
01:18:56,350 --> 01:18:58,020
I belong to Petty Gang.

2284
01:18:58,190 --> 01:18:59,610
I can't believe this.

2285
01:18:59,610 --> 01:19:01,480
- I belong to Petty Gang too.
- Petty Gang.

2286
01:19:01,480 --> 01:19:03,410
Why would you have the tattoo?

2287
01:19:03,410 --> 01:19:05,650
- It's Petty Gang.
- Okay. Petty Gang.

2288
01:19:05,650 --> 01:19:07,260
Are we going to
keep using that gang?

2289
01:19:07,260 --> 01:19:09,430
We are petty gangsters
of Petty Gang.

2290
01:19:09,430 --> 01:19:11,300
Why did I trust Suk Jin?

2291
01:19:11,300 --> 01:19:14,620
Do Won was a citizen
who was caught up...

2292
01:19:14,620 --> 01:19:15,660
in the set-up crime.

2293
01:19:15,660 --> 01:19:16,940
Do Won was a citizen.

2294
01:19:16,940 --> 01:19:19,770
I thought he might be innocent,
but I couldn't trust him...

2295
01:19:19,770 --> 01:19:22,230
- because of his shirt.
- It's because of the shirt.

2296
01:19:22,230 --> 01:19:24,610
This is the story of our new movie.

2297
01:19:24,610 --> 01:19:26,370
I see.

2298
01:19:26,370 --> 01:19:29,550
The suspect, Do Won's team lost,

2299
01:19:29,550 --> 01:19:32,650
so Do Won and another person
will get a penalty.

2300
01:19:32,890 --> 01:19:35,950
Do Won, please pick a person
whom you want to get a penalty with.

2301
01:19:35,950 --> 01:19:36,980
Okay.

2302
01:19:36,980 --> 01:19:38,780
(Who'd be Do Won's penalty partner?)

2303
01:19:39,020 --> 01:19:40,520
- Dae Myeung.
- Yes?

2304
01:19:40,520 --> 01:19:41,650
(Dae Myeung...)

2305
01:19:42,020 --> 01:19:43,490
(He has a guilty look.)

2306
01:19:44,020 --> 01:19:45,400
Dae Myeung deserves it.

2307
01:19:45,400 --> 01:19:46,600
- He deserves it.
- I think...

2308
01:19:46,600 --> 01:19:49,030
- Dae Myeung should get a penalty.
- I'll gladly get a penalty.

2309
01:19:49,030 --> 01:19:52,810
The penalty is brushing your teeth
with bay salt...

2310
01:19:52,810 --> 01:19:54,060
which is known to be
good for your teeth.

2311
01:19:54,060 --> 01:19:57,140
- The penalty isn't that bad.
- It's nice.

2312
01:19:57,140 --> 01:19:59,150
This is a good thing.

2313
01:19:59,150 --> 01:20:01,050
Brush your teeth for 30 seconds.

2314
01:20:01,400 --> 01:20:03,150
Make sure to show that it's salty.

2315
01:20:03,770 --> 01:20:05,780
(Make sure to show that it's salty.)

2316
01:20:05,780 --> 01:20:07,390
My goodness.

2317
01:20:07,390 --> 01:20:08,610
(Why would he force them
to do things like that?)

2318
01:20:09,060 --> 01:20:11,780
(It is salty though.)

2319
01:20:12,280 --> 01:20:13,590
(Suk Jin forces the guests
to show some reactions.)

2320
01:20:13,590 --> 01:20:15,490
You're the worst.

2321
01:20:15,490 --> 01:20:18,560
He did a good job today,
so he's being condescending.

2322
01:20:18,600 --> 01:20:20,190
Do Won, are you all right?

2323
01:20:20,520 --> 01:20:22,230
- Gosh.
- Dae Myeung, are you okay?

2324
01:20:22,230 --> 01:20:23,800
It's all my fault.

2325
01:20:24,940 --> 01:20:28,110
And the winner, Petty Gang,
will get a prize.

2326
01:20:28,110 --> 01:20:29,700
What's the prize for Petty Gang?

2327
01:20:30,010 --> 01:20:31,680
You will get 10 movie tickets each.

2328
01:20:31,680 --> 01:20:33,350
- Really?
- That sounds great.

2329
01:20:33,350 --> 01:20:35,980
- Wow.
- It's a great gift.

2330
01:20:35,980 --> 01:20:37,270
It's really nice.

2331
01:20:37,270 --> 01:20:38,850
I hope you will enjoy good movies.

2332
01:20:39,720 --> 01:20:42,190
Please remember that
our movie will be a lot more fun.

2333
01:20:42,190 --> 01:20:43,220
Please watch it.

2334
01:20:43,220 --> 01:20:44,610
(It's an objective review
by the leading actor.)

2335
01:20:44,610 --> 01:20:46,730
- "The Golden Holiday" is fun.
- It's "The Golden Holiday".

2336
01:20:46,730 --> 01:20:48,560
Please enjoy the movie. Thank you.

2337
01:20:48,560 --> 01:20:50,260
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

2338
01:20:50,260 --> 01:20:51,990
(We'd like to thank Do Won, Sang Ho,
and Dae Myeung for joining us.)

2339
01:20:52,600 --> 01:20:54,160
(Once you shoot the gun,
it will be pandemonium.)

2340
01:20:54,620 --> 01:20:56,690
(We're not going to die like this.)

2341
01:20:57,060 --> 01:20:58,940
(It's time! Shoot it.)

2342
01:20:59,140 --> 01:21:00,230
I'm a legendary sniper.

2343
01:21:00,230 --> 01:21:01,230
(With balloons on their backs,)

2344
01:21:01,230 --> 01:21:03,070
(the legendary snipers
have a gunfight.)

2345
01:21:03,570 --> 01:21:04,810
(But...)

2346
01:21:04,810 --> 01:21:06,610
(they are connected
to each other with some rope.)

2347
01:21:06,610 --> 01:21:07,700
(Those who are connected...)

2348
01:21:07,700 --> 01:21:09,150
(are one team.)

2349
01:21:09,520 --> 01:21:11,890
(United they stand,
and divided they fall.)

2350
01:21:12,520 --> 01:21:13,520
(If they want to sever the link,)

2351
01:21:13,520 --> 01:21:15,780
(they have to raise
the average standard.)

2352
01:21:16,810 --> 01:21:19,690
(They have some activities that are
as thrilling as the Nevis Swing.)

2353
01:21:20,590 --> 01:21:21,760
(With this link,)

2354
01:21:21,760 --> 01:21:24,650
(who will be
the last one to survive?)

2355
01:21:25,860 --> 01:21:28,770
(The link average race,
Cut Off to Survive)
