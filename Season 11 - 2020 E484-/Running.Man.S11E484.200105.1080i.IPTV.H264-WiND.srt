1
00:00:01,930 --> 00:00:03,400
You win a point
if you get the answer right.

2
00:00:03,400 --> 00:00:06,360
However, you cannot directly mention
the movie title,

3
00:00:06,400 --> 00:00:08,330
the cast or quotes from the movie.

4
00:00:09,830 --> 00:00:12,290
(They didn't earn the hint
as they failed the 1st round.)

5
00:00:12,290 --> 00:00:14,900
You failed your 1st round.
Pick someone for your 2nd round.

6
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:17,780
We should switch.

7
00:00:17,780 --> 00:00:19,280
- Shall we start? Start?
- Let's switch.

8
00:00:19,370 --> 00:00:21,550
I have to show you how it's done.
I have no choice.

9
00:00:21,550 --> 00:00:22,850
(The directors might fail on purpose
to sabotage the game.)

10
00:00:23,550 --> 00:00:25,440
(Jae Suk, Kwang Soo, So Min,
Ji Hyo, Jong Kook, and Se Chan)

11
00:00:25,440 --> 00:00:28,020
You can discuss it before answering.

12
00:00:28,050 --> 00:00:30,020
- Goodness, this one.
- Gosh.

13
00:00:30,290 --> 00:00:32,660
Guys, you guys are so frustrating.

14
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:35,190
(What was that?)

15
00:00:35,460 --> 00:00:38,400
I bet all of my money
that he won't get it right.

16
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:40,320
By the way,
he's the king of improvised lines.

17
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:42,630
- Jong Kook. You know...
- Gosh, Jae Suk.

18
00:00:42,630 --> 00:00:44,570
You should go first.
The king of improvised lines.

19
00:00:45,070 --> 00:00:46,410
(Is it time for me
to take the lead?)

20
00:00:46,410 --> 00:00:47,440
- The king of improvised lines.
- Gosh.

21
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:49,740
- The king is going to play now.
- I'm already looking forward to it.

22
00:00:49,910 --> 00:00:51,330
I'm really looking forward to that.

23
00:00:51,540 --> 00:00:53,410
Jae Suk, you look
very nervous right now.

24
00:00:53,410 --> 00:00:54,410
Not at all.

25
00:00:54,410 --> 00:00:56,070
- You look very nervous right now.
- Not at all.

26
00:00:56,270 --> 00:00:57,470
- Don't be so nervous.
- Look at me.

27
00:00:57,470 --> 00:00:58,680
Why are your lips so purple?

28
00:00:59,550 --> 00:01:00,940
- Don't be so nervous.
- Hey.

29
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:02,550
- Just watch me.
- Okay.

30
00:01:02,550 --> 00:01:04,190
Do you know
what I'm doing behind this?

31
00:01:04,190 --> 00:01:05,350
- What?
- What?

32
00:01:06,350 --> 00:01:09,550
I have my hands in my pocket.

33
00:01:10,460 --> 00:01:11,550
(He's laid-back as he's the king.)

34
00:01:11,550 --> 00:01:13,270
This shows that I'm totally at ease.

35
00:01:13,570 --> 00:01:15,490
- He's confident.
- You're no joke.

36
00:01:15,490 --> 00:01:17,740
- You're totally relaxed.
- I'm flexing it.

37
00:01:17,800 --> 00:01:19,400
- He's "flexing".
- You're so cool.

38
00:01:19,440 --> 00:01:20,570
Here's your question.

39
00:01:20,600 --> 00:01:22,880
- You have three seconds. Ready,
- Let's go.

40
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:24,700
set, go.

41
00:01:25,880 --> 00:01:27,070
Hey, it's...

42
00:01:27,070 --> 00:01:28,250
"Hey".

43
00:01:28,810 --> 00:01:30,720
(The explanation of the movie
by the king of improvised lines)

44
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:32,510
- Hold on. Al...
- Goodness. This is so easy.

45
00:01:33,510 --> 00:01:35,620
(They didn't get it wrong, but why
did he get the water balloon?)

46
00:01:35,620 --> 00:01:36,950
(He's punished
for his weak explanation.)

47
00:01:36,950 --> 00:01:38,220
- Not yet. You have to answer first.
- We didn't answer yet.

48
00:01:38,690 --> 00:01:40,090
Hey, throw it at him.

49
00:01:40,420 --> 00:01:41,660
- "Al"? Hold on.
- Do it.

50
00:01:41,820 --> 00:01:43,130
"Al"?

51
00:01:43,450 --> 00:01:44,890
Could it be "Jurassic Park"?

52
00:01:45,220 --> 00:01:46,920
- "Running Man".
- No, no.

53
00:01:47,030 --> 00:01:48,660
- "Jurassic Park".
- We're talking about movies.

54
00:01:48,660 --> 00:01:49,840
- There's a movie with that name.
- Oh, the movie?

55
00:01:49,940 --> 00:01:51,230
There's no way they gave us that.

56
00:01:51,290 --> 00:01:52,390
There's no way.

57
00:01:52,390 --> 00:01:53,730
I doubt that they gave us that
as our question.

58
00:01:53,730 --> 00:01:54,810
- "Jurassic Park" is the only one...
- That's it.

59
00:01:54,810 --> 00:01:55,870
- I can think of.
- Fine.

60
00:01:55,870 --> 00:01:57,010
- In 1, 2, 3.
- What's your answer?

61
00:01:57,010 --> 00:01:58,130
- "Jurassic Park".
- "Jurassic Park".

62
00:01:59,380 --> 00:02:01,640
(The king of improvised lines' hint
was "Al".)

63
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:03,410
(Will the answer be
"Jurassic Park"?)

64
00:02:03,410 --> 00:02:05,320
- In 1, 2, 3. "Jurassic Park".
- In 2, 3. "Jurassic Park".

65
00:02:05,970 --> 00:02:07,220
- What's the answer?
- What was the hint about?

66
00:02:07,220 --> 00:02:09,120
(Incorrect)

67
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:10,190
"Aladdin".

68
00:02:10,220 --> 00:02:11,880
I see. It was the first syllable
of the title.

69
00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:14,060
- I gave you the first syllable.
- But you cannot do that.

70
00:02:14,660 --> 00:02:16,420
- You can't say the title.
- That's cheating.

71
00:02:16,530 --> 00:02:18,420
- What did you say?
- You can't say part of the title.

72
00:02:18,420 --> 00:02:19,720
It's okay for you
to be bad at games,

73
00:02:19,820 --> 00:02:21,570
but you cheat and play dirty.

74
00:02:21,790 --> 00:02:24,230
- Why put your hands in your pocket?
- Why isn't that allowed?

75
00:02:24,290 --> 00:02:26,510
- They did that earlier.
- We can't say anything about it?

76
00:02:26,510 --> 00:02:27,600
- Okay, I got it.
- You can't.

77
00:02:27,810 --> 00:02:29,730
- We'll start.
- Watch me. I'll "shaw" you.

78
00:02:29,940 --> 00:02:31,100
- He'll "shaw" us.
- "Shaw"?

79
00:02:31,100 --> 00:02:32,170
Watch me. I'll "shaw" you.

80
00:02:32,170 --> 00:02:33,470
(You'll "shaw" us?)

81
00:02:33,470 --> 00:02:35,100
Se Chan sounds really nervous.

82
00:02:35,100 --> 00:02:36,280
- He's really nervous now.
- What?

83
00:02:36,410 --> 00:02:38,850
- I'm sorry.
<i>- I'll shaw you</i>

84
00:02:39,250 --> 00:02:40,410
I'll shaw you. Watch.

85
00:02:40,410 --> 00:02:41,480
(He's a fool.)

86
00:02:41,480 --> 00:02:42,910
- I can "dew" a good job.
- That's cute.

87
00:02:42,910 --> 00:02:44,350
The way he said it was cute, right?

88
00:02:44,350 --> 00:02:45,820
- I'll show you.
- Start.

89
00:02:46,660 --> 00:02:48,660
(The second question begins.)

90
00:02:48,660 --> 00:02:52,690
He goes up somewhere
and meets a grandma.

91
00:02:52,760 --> 00:02:54,100
(He goes up somewhere
and meets a grandma.)

92
00:02:54,100 --> 00:02:55,320
"The Way Home".

93
00:02:55,420 --> 00:02:56,790
- "The Way Home".
- Hold on.

94
00:02:56,790 --> 00:02:58,230
- He goes up and meets a grandma?
- "The Way Home".

95
00:02:58,230 --> 00:02:59,390
Does he go up the mountain?

96
00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:01,260
He goes up and meets a grandma?

97
00:03:01,260 --> 00:03:02,440
"The Way Home".

98
00:03:02,440 --> 00:03:03,540
- Wait. Be quiet.
- Does that count as going up?

99
00:03:03,540 --> 00:03:04,600
Be quiet!

100
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:07,010
(Wait. Be quiet. Be quiet!)

101
00:03:07,010 --> 00:03:09,440
(He gets mad
in the middle of the quiz.)

102
00:03:10,380 --> 00:03:11,750
Don't be so rash!

103
00:03:12,250 --> 00:03:13,410
- Hey.
- Why are you so...

104
00:03:13,480 --> 00:03:15,010
- I was just talking.
- What's wrong with you?

105
00:03:15,010 --> 00:03:16,140
He sounds very mad.

106
00:03:16,140 --> 00:03:17,480
Who meets the grandma?

107
00:03:18,380 --> 00:03:20,260
- The grandma?
- It has to be "The Way Home".

108
00:03:20,260 --> 00:03:21,820
- "The Way Home".
- That's the only possible answer.

109
00:03:21,820 --> 00:03:23,060
- It's "The Way Home".
- Okay. It's "The Way Home".

110
00:03:23,060 --> 00:03:24,450
- What's your answer?
- "The Way Home"!

111
00:03:24,890 --> 00:03:26,030
- That's correct!
- Yes!

112
00:03:26,030 --> 00:03:27,370
("The Way Home"
is the right answer.)

113
00:03:28,470 --> 00:03:30,000
- I did a good job, right?
- "The Way Home".

114
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,290
- Did I do a good job?
- Well done.

115
00:03:31,290 --> 00:03:32,460
- I did well, right?
- Well done.

116
00:03:32,460 --> 00:03:33,630
- Well done.
- Well done.

117
00:03:33,630 --> 00:03:35,670
- I did well.
- You did very well.

118
00:03:35,670 --> 00:03:37,010
Hey, it's your girlfriend's turn.

119
00:03:37,530 --> 00:03:38,700
My girlfriend?

120
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:40,750
(Peekaboo)

121
00:03:41,810 --> 00:03:43,140
My goodness.

122
00:03:43,340 --> 00:03:44,550
You're unbelievable.

123
00:03:44,820 --> 00:03:46,510
You're something else.

124
00:03:46,510 --> 00:03:48,050
Here you go. Start.

125
00:03:48,940 --> 00:03:50,190
- Gosh.
- That's hard.

126
00:03:50,620 --> 00:03:52,320
Gosh, the doll is really scary.

127
00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:54,630
(Gosh, the doll is really scary.)

128
00:03:54,630 --> 00:03:55,990
- Okay.
- "Child's Play".

129
00:03:55,990 --> 00:03:57,320
(Answering right away)

130
00:03:57,320 --> 00:03:58,730
- Wait.
- Hold on.

131
00:03:58,730 --> 00:04:00,190
- It's "Child's Play".
- No, she can't mention that.

132
00:04:00,430 --> 00:04:03,070
- I told you not to be so rash!
- Jong Kook.

133
00:04:03,530 --> 00:04:04,670
Goodness.

134
00:04:04,670 --> 00:04:07,260
- Why are you wasting our chance?
- Jae Suk...

135
00:04:07,370 --> 00:04:08,630
Let's discuss this first.

136
00:04:08,630 --> 00:04:09,770
It's not because he's the director.

137
00:04:09,770 --> 00:04:11,940
- He's just easily distracted.
- Listen.

138
00:04:11,940 --> 00:04:14,010
I bet that for 12 years,
in his student record,

139
00:04:14,010 --> 00:04:15,510
- it said he was easily distracted.
- How did you know that?

140
00:04:15,610 --> 00:04:16,750
I'm the same way with you.

141
00:04:16,820 --> 00:04:18,840
We could have discussed it.

142
00:04:18,840 --> 00:04:20,340
She can't probably mention the doll.

143
00:04:20,840 --> 00:04:22,640
- It has to be that. "Annabelle"
- "Annabelle".

144
00:04:22,820 --> 00:04:23,990
What's your answer?

145
00:04:23,990 --> 00:04:25,080
- "Annabelle".
- "Annabelle".

146
00:04:26,150 --> 00:04:29,190
(She mentioned a scary doll.
What's the right answer?)

147
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:30,730
- Okay.
- Okay.

148
00:04:30,730 --> 00:04:31,860
That was well-played, Jong Kook.

149
00:04:31,860 --> 00:04:32,950
(They answered
2 questions out of 3.)

150
00:04:32,950 --> 00:04:34,500
They are good at this.

151
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:35,570
Jong Kook, you can go next.

152
00:04:35,630 --> 00:04:37,030
- Jong Kook, show us.
- Jong Kook.

153
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:39,590
- Let's see how good you are.
- "Let's see how good you are."

154
00:04:39,590 --> 00:04:41,330
I'm not saying
that I'm good at this.

155
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:43,270
I just want you
to answer this carefully.

156
00:04:43,270 --> 00:04:44,330
We'll calm down.

157
00:04:44,330 --> 00:04:45,940
- We'll give it a go.
- Ready, set, go.

158
00:04:45,940 --> 00:04:47,480
(Fourth question,
"Bohemian Rhapsody")

159
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:50,380
He sings songs on stage.

160
00:04:50,710 --> 00:04:51,710
- Hold on.
- He sings songs on stage?

161
00:04:51,710 --> 00:04:53,340
- It could be "Bohemian Rhapsody".
- "Born to Sing"?

162
00:04:53,340 --> 00:04:54,920
There's "Highway Star" too.

163
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:56,140
- No.
- There's "Born to Sing" too.

164
00:04:56,140 --> 00:04:57,210
It's "200 Pounds Beauty".

165
00:04:57,560 --> 00:04:59,320
- There are too many.
- Then, he should've said "she".

166
00:04:59,320 --> 00:05:00,320
Right.

167
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:01,730
- "Bohemian Rhapsody".
- Gosh, "Bohemian Rhapsody".

168
00:05:01,730 --> 00:05:03,320
- There's one for The Beatles too.
- Wait. You can't...

169
00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:04,890
- You can't make a face for it.
- "Bohemian Rhapsody".

170
00:05:04,890 --> 00:05:05,930
- "Bohemian Rhapsody".
- No?

171
00:05:07,020 --> 00:05:09,690
(Making a face
while blinking furiously)

172
00:05:10,330 --> 00:05:12,330
- "Bohemian Rhapsody".
- What? Hold on.

173
00:05:12,330 --> 00:05:13,610
- Wait.
- What's wrong with that?

174
00:05:13,610 --> 00:05:14,760
- I didn't do anything.
- He just blinked.

175
00:05:14,760 --> 00:05:16,010
"200 Pounds Beauty".

176
00:05:16,370 --> 00:05:17,610
Wait. No.

177
00:05:17,610 --> 00:05:18,940
"Bohemian Rhapsody".

178
00:05:20,050 --> 00:05:21,070
Jae Suk.

179
00:05:21,070 --> 00:05:22,810
What? I didn't do anything.

180
00:05:23,510 --> 00:05:25,180
- "Bohemian Rhapsody".
- "Bohemian Rhapsody".

181
00:05:25,340 --> 00:05:26,550
"200 Pounds Beauty".

182
00:05:27,490 --> 00:05:28,840
Bo.

183
00:05:29,050 --> 00:05:30,190
200.

184
00:05:30,190 --> 00:05:31,560
- "Born to Sing"?
- That's it.

185
00:05:31,710 --> 00:05:32,780
- Come here.
- All right. Jae Suk.

186
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:34,130
(He doesn't need to speak.)

187
00:05:34,130 --> 00:05:35,930
- Hey, Jae Suk. In 1, 2, 3.
- In 1, 2, 3.

188
00:05:35,930 --> 00:05:37,090
- "Bohemian Rhapsody".
- "Bohemian Rhapsody".

189
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:40,730
(Fine, we'll let you take it.
That's correct.)

190
00:05:40,730 --> 00:05:41,890
Okay!

191
00:05:41,960 --> 00:05:44,370
Wait, he opened his eyes wide.

192
00:05:44,440 --> 00:05:46,740
- Okay. Great.
- Okay.

193
00:05:46,740 --> 00:05:47,830
(When everyone is having fun now,)

194
00:05:47,830 --> 00:05:49,700
(the Airtime Destroyer
is worried about his airtime.)

195
00:05:49,700 --> 00:05:51,380
(Mom)

196
00:05:51,510 --> 00:05:52,530
Ready,

197
00:05:52,980 --> 00:05:55,270
set, go.

198
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:57,550
- He uses magic.
- Start.

199
00:05:58,480 --> 00:06:00,510
He uses magic. He uses magic.

200
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:02,490
- What?
- "Harry Potter".

201
00:06:02,490 --> 00:06:04,120
- "Harry Potter".
- He uses magic.

202
00:06:04,820 --> 00:06:06,210
Gosh, this is hard.

203
00:06:06,210 --> 00:06:07,430
- Goodness, this is difficult.
- When it comes to magic,

204
00:06:07,430 --> 00:06:08,730
- I only think of "Harry Potter".
- No.

205
00:06:08,730 --> 00:06:10,000
Don't do anything.

206
00:06:10,260 --> 00:06:11,260
What are you doing?

207
00:06:11,260 --> 00:06:12,560
What else do we have
other than "Harry Potter"?

208
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:14,020
- No, you can't do that.
- It's not "The Lord of the Rings".

209
00:06:14,020 --> 00:06:15,260
- What other movies are about magic?
- What is it?

210
00:06:15,820 --> 00:06:17,260
Jae Suk keeps asking what it is.

211
00:06:18,090 --> 00:06:19,830
What other movies do we have
for magic?

212
00:06:20,370 --> 00:06:23,030
- The one with Gang Dong Won.
- "Haunters".

213
00:06:23,030 --> 00:06:24,400
The one with Gang Dong Won in it.

214
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:25,770
He wears that costume and flies.

215
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:28,310
- "Jeon Woo-chi"?
- "Jeon Woo-chi".

216
00:06:28,550 --> 00:06:29,820
- "Jeon Woo-chi"?
- "Jeon Woo-chi"?

217
00:06:29,820 --> 00:06:33,710
(Could that be the answer, Se Chan?)

218
00:06:33,710 --> 00:06:35,380
"Jeon Woo-chi" must be the answer.

219
00:06:35,380 --> 00:06:36,440
(Smiling)

220
00:06:37,010 --> 00:06:39,880
(When he hears "Jeon Woo-chi",
he can't stop smiling.)

221
00:06:42,230 --> 00:06:43,360
(They communicate
with the trophy of the truth.)

222
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:45,190
- That's not a bad answer.
- "Jeon Woo-chi".

223
00:06:45,190 --> 00:06:46,500
- That's cheating.
- Shall we go with that?

224
00:06:46,570 --> 00:06:48,520
- In 1, 2, 3.
- Jong Kook.

225
00:06:48,630 --> 00:06:50,800
- "Jeon Woo-chi".
- "Jeon Woo-chi".

226
00:06:51,130 --> 00:06:52,940
(That's correct!)

227
00:06:52,940 --> 00:06:55,260
- How did they get that right?
- That's amazing.

228
00:06:55,260 --> 00:06:56,630
How did you get that right?

229
00:06:56,770 --> 00:06:58,700
- Next.
- Go, Mr. Fish.

230
00:06:58,740 --> 00:06:59,740
Okay.

231
00:06:59,740 --> 00:07:01,900
- Make sure to fully discuss it.
- Okay.

232
00:07:02,070 --> 00:07:03,210
All right. Here we go.

233
00:07:03,750 --> 00:07:05,880
- Ready,
- Look at his face.

234
00:07:05,880 --> 00:07:07,250
- set,
- You must explain right away.

235
00:07:07,820 --> 00:07:08,880
go!

236
00:07:10,190 --> 00:07:12,420
Why is this day on this day?

237
00:07:12,860 --> 00:07:13,880
- Hold on.
- Hold on.

238
00:07:13,880 --> 00:07:16,360
- "Why is this day on this day?"
- "Why is this day on this day?"

239
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:18,800
- But his explanation was great.
- I'm sure they'll get it right.

240
00:07:18,950 --> 00:07:20,070
I guess it was a good explanation.

241
00:07:20,070 --> 00:07:21,630
- It has to do with a date.
- It wasn't bad.

242
00:07:21,630 --> 00:07:22,760
"Why is this day on this day?"

243
00:07:22,870 --> 00:07:24,630
- It has to be a date.
- "1987".

244
00:07:24,630 --> 00:07:26,700
- "1987"?
- "1987"? Wait. No.

245
00:07:26,830 --> 00:07:27,830
We must say it as a group.

246
00:07:30,110 --> 00:07:32,530
(He tries to cheat.)

247
00:07:32,530 --> 00:07:34,480
What?

248
00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:35,880
You keep moving your fingers.

249
00:07:35,880 --> 00:07:37,010
Not yet.

250
00:07:37,010 --> 00:07:38,820
- Goodness.
- "Why is this day on this day?"

251
00:07:38,820 --> 00:07:40,440
I guess this day
must not make sense for this day.

252
00:07:41,340 --> 00:07:43,050
I got it! I figured it out!

253
00:07:43,490 --> 00:07:44,620
It's "Christmas in August".

254
00:07:44,620 --> 00:07:45,820
- Yes, that must be it.
- Yes!

255
00:07:45,820 --> 00:07:47,580
(It's "Christmas in August".)

256
00:07:47,580 --> 00:07:48,760
- That must be it.
- That must be it.

257
00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:50,550
- I got it. "Christmas in August".
- "Christmas in August".

258
00:07:50,920 --> 00:07:53,790
(Is the right answer
"Christmas in August"?)

259
00:07:53,790 --> 00:07:55,330
- "Christmas in August".
- "Christmas in August".

260
00:07:55,920 --> 00:07:59,060
(That's correct!)

261
00:07:59,060 --> 00:08:00,300
Yes!

262
00:08:00,300 --> 00:08:01,430
- His fingers...
- Why did you throw the balloon?

263
00:08:01,430 --> 00:08:03,340
- Why did you throw it at him?
- We could've done that too.

264
00:08:03,430 --> 00:08:04,770
Wait, this isn't a team match.
It's for everyone.

265
00:08:04,770 --> 00:08:06,640
I thought we were competing
against each other. I got confused.

266
00:08:06,640 --> 00:08:08,850
- He's acting really strange.
- I really got confused.

267
00:08:08,850 --> 00:08:10,410
- My gosh.
- I did give you a hint.

268
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:12,010
- Why did you do that?
- But he threw the balloon at me.

269
00:08:12,010 --> 00:08:13,120
You gave us a hint?

270
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:14,910
- I was doing this with my fingers.
- Really?

271
00:08:15,090 --> 00:08:16,990
All of a sudden, Haha threw
the water balloon at me.

272
00:08:17,150 --> 00:08:18,620
- What are you doing?
- We can do that too?

273
00:08:18,620 --> 00:08:19,990
I really thought
this was a competition.

274
00:08:19,990 --> 00:08:21,420
It's not a competition.
We must all get the hint.

275
00:08:21,420 --> 00:08:22,880
- It's for the whole group.
- What's wrong with him?

276
00:08:23,050 --> 00:08:24,630
- You didn't give us the hint.
- Hey.

277
00:08:24,630 --> 00:08:25,890
Of course,
we're competing against you...

278
00:08:25,890 --> 00:08:27,290
because you're a director.

279
00:08:27,290 --> 00:08:28,500
- What are you talking about?
- And we...

280
00:08:28,790 --> 00:08:32,430
(Jong Kook starts to activate
his radar for spies again.)

281
00:08:32,430 --> 00:08:34,370
The spy instinct hits you
before you know it.

282
00:08:34,430 --> 00:08:37,430
- This is crazy. Okay, fine.
- When you get into it, it happens.

283
00:08:37,430 --> 00:08:38,980
Let us play one more time.

284
00:08:39,270 --> 00:08:41,300
- We should play again.
- Hear us out.

285
00:08:41,300 --> 00:08:42,800
- We didn't have time to discuss it.
- I was doing this the whole time.

286
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:44,620
- So our clip wasn't funny at all.
- We can be funny too.

287
00:08:44,620 --> 00:08:46,270
You have one more round.

288
00:08:46,270 --> 00:08:47,720
You must complete the next round
to complete the mission.

289
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:49,990
Listen. The winning team
doesn't get the hint.

290
00:08:49,990 --> 00:08:52,380
- This isn't a match between us.
- We're on the same team.

291
00:08:52,380 --> 00:08:53,680
- I know that.
- Listen.

292
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:56,180
- Because we have this guy here...
- Excuse me. "This guy"?

293
00:08:56,180 --> 00:08:58,390
(Haha is super sensitive.
Kyung-hwan sounds like a thug.)

294
00:08:58,390 --> 00:08:59,860
(They aren't happy
as there won't be a lot of airtime.)

295
00:08:59,860 --> 00:09:01,520
They are not interested in the hint.

296
00:09:01,890 --> 00:09:03,600
- It's because of the airtime.
- We're just worried...

297
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:05,470
- that our clip won't air on TV.
- Let's do this.

298
00:09:06,060 --> 00:09:07,930
We want to be entertaining too.

299
00:09:07,930 --> 00:09:09,870
- You guys were fun in your own way.
- Right.

300
00:09:09,930 --> 00:09:11,400
When were we funny?

301
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:13,300
(Let's get something straight.)

302
00:09:13,450 --> 00:09:14,770
- There's the third round.
- Let's play again.

303
00:09:14,770 --> 00:09:15,980
- You must pick six people again.
- What?

304
00:09:15,980 --> 00:09:17,140
- You should form a team again.
- We'll play again.

305
00:09:17,140 --> 00:09:18,310
- We'll play.
- Okay.

306
00:09:18,350 --> 00:09:19,510
- Listen.
- This is unfair.

307
00:09:19,510 --> 00:09:20,750
We're on the same team.

308
00:09:20,750 --> 00:09:23,280
Ready, set, go.

309
00:09:23,510 --> 00:09:24,590
("Ant-Man")

310
00:09:24,590 --> 00:09:27,960
Gosh, I didn't know a hero
as small as me existed.

311
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:29,020
- Hero?
- A small hero?

312
00:09:29,020 --> 00:09:30,420
- "Ant-Man".
- He's small.

313
00:09:30,420 --> 00:09:31,650
- "Ant-Man".
- Hold on.

314
00:09:31,650 --> 00:09:33,920
Is that the only small hero?

315
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:36,290
- It's a small hero.
- I know who it is. It's him.

316
00:09:36,290 --> 00:09:38,260
- Let's see if there are more.
- Right.

317
00:09:38,430 --> 00:09:39,840
- They're making it harder for them.
- Right.

318
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:42,630
- They are.
- They're making it harder.

319
00:09:42,630 --> 00:09:44,480
What other heroes are small?

320
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:45,530
Isn't it just him?

321
00:09:45,530 --> 00:09:46,710
(They can't think
of anything funnier.)

322
00:09:46,710 --> 00:09:48,140
- Lego.
- "Stuart Little".

323
00:09:48,140 --> 00:09:50,450
You already got the answer.
Why are you hesitating?

324
00:09:50,540 --> 00:09:51,720
You already got it.

325
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:53,120
Come on.

326
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:54,780
- Come on.
- You're trying so hard.

327
00:09:55,140 --> 00:09:56,760
Aren't you going to say,
"Ant-Man" anyway?

328
00:09:56,760 --> 00:09:58,590
We need to think
of something funnier...

329
00:09:58,590 --> 00:09:59,910
so that we'll get more screen time.

330
00:10:00,130 --> 00:10:01,280
Hold on.

331
00:10:01,280 --> 00:10:02,420
(They're trying to get
more screen time.)

332
00:10:02,420 --> 00:10:03,420
(Smiling)

333
00:10:03,700 --> 00:10:06,020
- It's obviously "Ant-Man".
- That's enough.

334
00:10:06,290 --> 00:10:07,920
Be more creative!

335
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:08,920
(He pressures them
to be more creative.)

336
00:10:08,920 --> 00:10:10,130
"Ant-Man".

337
00:10:10,130 --> 00:10:11,500
- "The Incredible Hulk".
- "Superman".

338
00:10:13,240 --> 00:10:15,160
- It's "Ant-Man" for sure.
- What's your answer?

339
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:17,130
- "Ant-Man".
- 1, 2, 3.

340
00:10:17,130 --> 00:10:18,300
(They're not in harmony.)

341
00:10:18,770 --> 00:10:20,380
(Nothing is working out for him.)

342
00:10:20,380 --> 00:10:21,540
They're not in harmony at all.

343
00:10:21,540 --> 00:10:23,350
- 1, 2, 3. "Ant-Man".
- "Ant-Man".

344
00:10:23,350 --> 00:10:24,750
- My team's so boring.
- Right.

345
00:10:24,750 --> 00:10:25,880
(That is the correct answer.)

346
00:10:25,880 --> 00:10:27,310
(My team's so boring.)

347
00:10:27,510 --> 00:10:29,680
- No, Chul Min edits well.
- You guys are boring.

348
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:31,260
Don't be ridiculous.

349
00:10:31,260 --> 00:10:32,760
They can make it interesting.

350
00:10:32,910 --> 00:10:34,550
It gets boring when Kyung-hwan...

351
00:10:34,550 --> 00:10:36,230
- is in the picture.
- Right.

352
00:10:36,890 --> 00:10:38,700
(He's boring.)

353
00:10:38,700 --> 00:10:40,390
- It's so weird.
- What do you mean?

354
00:10:40,390 --> 00:10:42,390
- Why are you like that?
- What are you talking about?

355
00:10:42,730 --> 00:10:44,530
I'm making everyone laugh.

356
00:10:44,530 --> 00:10:46,100
Is this magic?

357
00:10:46,100 --> 00:10:47,870
- Kyung-hwan.
- My goodness.

358
00:10:47,870 --> 00:10:49,970
How can I make it funnier
when we already have the answer?

359
00:10:49,970 --> 00:10:51,270
- But...
- I know.

360
00:10:51,270 --> 00:10:53,640
(Take this water balloon
for more screen time.)

361
00:10:54,850 --> 00:10:58,720
(Kwang Soo hits him
with a water balloon.)

362
00:10:59,850 --> 00:11:02,120
It didn't burst.

363
00:11:02,380 --> 00:11:04,010
It didn't burst.

364
00:11:04,150 --> 00:11:06,650
- It could've been funny.
- Why didn't it burst?

365
00:11:06,650 --> 00:11:07,860
Please!

366
00:11:07,860 --> 00:11:08,960
(His screen time is reduced.)

367
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:10,150
Darn it!

368
00:11:10,150 --> 00:11:11,700
(It fails again.)

369
00:11:11,700 --> 00:11:13,100
Darn it!

370
00:11:13,100 --> 00:11:15,100
- Like this! Like this!
- Okay!

371
00:11:15,100 --> 00:11:16,520
Let me.

372
00:11:17,290 --> 00:11:19,500
(No matter how much I try,)

373
00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:20,800
(this balloon is quite sturdy.)

374
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:23,300
- Hold on.
- What is this thing?

375
00:11:23,710 --> 00:11:25,240
Why isn't this working?

376
00:11:25,880 --> 00:11:28,400
He can't even make us laugh.

377
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:30,170
Here he comes.

378
00:11:30,170 --> 00:11:32,480
Show us.

379
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:34,750
- This is your last chance.
- I'll make you laugh.

380
00:11:34,750 --> 00:11:37,090
Are you ready for it?

381
00:11:37,090 --> 00:11:39,360
- Let's go.
- Ready, set, go.

382
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:40,990
("Frozen")

383
00:11:40,990 --> 00:11:43,150
It's a cold world.

384
00:11:43,150 --> 00:11:44,960
(They get it immediately.)

385
00:11:44,960 --> 00:11:46,290
- A cold world?
- Is it the kingdom?

386
00:11:46,290 --> 00:11:47,600
- A cold world?
- I think so.

387
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:48,790
Here we go again.

388
00:11:49,870 --> 00:11:51,790
The answer is weird.

389
00:11:51,790 --> 00:11:53,660
No, just try it.

390
00:11:53,660 --> 00:11:56,060
A cold world? Ice world?

391
00:11:56,510 --> 00:11:57,510
"Tears of the Antarctic".

392
00:11:57,510 --> 00:11:59,530
It could be "Frozen II".

393
00:11:59,530 --> 00:12:01,400
There's also that other movie...

394
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:03,640
starring Song Kang Ho.
That train movie.

395
00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:04,950
- "Snowpiercer".
- "Snowpiercer".

396
00:12:04,950 --> 00:12:06,120
"Snowpiercer"?

397
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:07,180
(He's embarrassed.)

398
00:12:07,180 --> 00:12:08,180
(He has nothing left to say.)

399
00:12:08,180 --> 00:12:09,950
- Merry...
- Just say the answer.

400
00:12:11,310 --> 00:12:12,760
He gave up.

401
00:12:13,050 --> 00:12:14,680
Just say it.

402
00:12:14,680 --> 00:12:15,990
- Just say it. You got it.
- Hey.

403
00:12:15,990 --> 00:12:17,520
- You got the answer.
- I wanted to help.

404
00:12:17,630 --> 00:12:19,730
- This is the end.
- What's your answer?

405
00:12:19,730 --> 00:12:20,790
- "Frozen".
- "Frozen".

406
00:12:20,790 --> 00:12:21,920
Yes!

407
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:23,890
- Goodness.
- How long will this last?

408
00:12:23,890 --> 00:12:26,930
It's not that he's boring.

409
00:12:26,930 --> 00:12:29,210
It's just impossible for him
to be fun.

410
00:12:29,300 --> 00:12:30,610
(He's funny, uninteresting,
and has no screen time.)

411
00:12:30,610 --> 00:12:32,170
- It's impossible.
- You're right.

412
00:12:32,170 --> 00:12:33,480
Come on.

413
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:34,900
That one was easy.

414
00:12:34,900 --> 00:12:36,250
- I bet your game...
- Kyung-hwan is...

415
00:12:36,250 --> 00:12:38,140
will be shown in a small box
on the right-hand corner.

416
00:12:38,350 --> 00:12:39,980
It'll be shown briefly.

417
00:12:39,980 --> 00:12:42,680
- They'll charge the audience.
- They do that when it's boring.

418
00:12:42,680 --> 00:12:43,720
("Tidal Wave", "Highway Star")

419
00:12:43,720 --> 00:12:45,510
(Their game is shown in the box.
Although it wasn't fun,)

420
00:12:45,510 --> 00:12:46,760
(they got everything right
and receive a hint.)

421
00:12:46,760 --> 00:12:49,460
Since you got everything right,
I'll give you a hint.

422
00:12:49,990 --> 00:12:52,150
- Here comes the hint.
- Are we finally getting one?

423
00:12:52,150 --> 00:12:53,150
(What kind of hint will it be?)

424
00:12:53,150 --> 00:12:55,290
The directors...

425
00:12:55,290 --> 00:12:57,630
(The directors...)

426
00:12:58,740 --> 00:13:01,870
(During the 1st mission,
they received a hint.)

427
00:13:01,870 --> 00:13:07,040
(Yoyomi and Tae Oh were suspected.)

428
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:10,220
(Will the hint be about them?)

429
00:13:10,220 --> 00:13:12,450
The directors...

430
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:18,090
debuted more than three years ago.
Yoyomi isn't included.

431
00:13:18,090 --> 00:13:19,620
(Yoyomi is not on the list.)

432
00:13:19,620 --> 00:13:21,020
- It's not Yoyomi.
- No way.

433
00:13:21,020 --> 00:13:23,020
We were all suspecting her.

434
00:13:23,020 --> 00:13:24,420
- One of the directors is among...
- She was suspicious back there.

435
00:13:24,420 --> 00:13:25,830
So Min, Ji Hyo, and Hyosung.

436
00:13:25,830 --> 00:13:27,060
It's not me.

437
00:13:27,060 --> 00:13:29,200
- It's not me either.
- It's So Min or...

438
00:13:29,660 --> 00:13:31,030
We were young.

439
00:13:31,030 --> 00:13:32,560
(One of the directors is among
So Min, Ji Hyo, and Hyosung.)

440
00:13:33,130 --> 00:13:35,130
All right. You need to protect
the national actor...

441
00:13:35,130 --> 00:13:37,300
and eliminate the directors.

442
00:13:37,300 --> 00:13:38,740
The final mission is called
I Am an Actor.

443
00:13:39,030 --> 00:13:40,130
I hate this position.

444
00:13:40,130 --> 00:13:41,670
Hints regarding the directors
and the national actor...

445
00:13:41,670 --> 00:13:43,250
are hidden throughout this building.

446
00:13:43,250 --> 00:13:44,810
You must obtain them.
During the two trials...

447
00:13:44,810 --> 00:13:46,380
that take place every 30 minutes,

448
00:13:46,510 --> 00:13:48,450
you must eliminate the directors.

449
00:13:48,450 --> 00:13:50,220
If you do, the national actor
and the actors win.

450
00:13:50,220 --> 00:13:51,760
If the national actor
is eliminated...

451
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:54,420
or if you fail to eliminate
the directors during the two trials,

452
00:13:54,590 --> 00:13:57,650
the directors win.
The losing team will be penalized.

453
00:13:58,200 --> 00:13:59,550
Before the trial,

454
00:13:59,550 --> 00:14:01,660
only the directors
and the national actor...

455
00:14:01,660 --> 00:14:03,260
can remove the name tags.

456
00:14:03,260 --> 00:14:06,470
The other actors can only
eliminate them through the trials.

457
00:14:06,530 --> 00:14:08,260
However, if the directors
and the national actor...

458
00:14:08,260 --> 00:14:10,060
eliminate three actors,

459
00:14:10,060 --> 00:14:13,080
they will lose,
and the game will come to an end.

460
00:14:13,510 --> 00:14:15,950
So the actors can't remove
the directors' name tags?

461
00:14:15,950 --> 00:14:17,220
No, they can only do that
through the trials.

462
00:14:17,220 --> 00:14:18,450
Only through the trials.

463
00:14:18,450 --> 00:14:20,380
But we can help
the national actor, right?

464
00:14:20,380 --> 00:14:22,620
We can grab the directors
or twist their arms.

465
00:14:22,950 --> 00:14:25,050
- Or make them faint.
- Correct.

466
00:14:25,050 --> 00:14:26,510
We can do that.

467
00:14:26,510 --> 00:14:28,860
- You can't rip their name tags.
- Got it.

468
00:14:28,860 --> 00:14:30,090
Once you've moved
to your locations,

469
00:14:30,090 --> 00:14:32,390
- we'll start the race.
- Let's go!

470
00:14:33,390 --> 00:14:36,370
Ever since the beginning,

471
00:14:36,890 --> 00:14:39,290
Haha seemed a bit awkward.

472
00:14:39,290 --> 00:14:41,160
I'm suspicious.

473
00:14:41,160 --> 00:14:42,840
I think Tae Oh has a distinct role.

474
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:44,580
He's either a director
or the national actor.

475
00:14:45,270 --> 00:14:47,640
I don't need to explain
about Tae Oh's actions.

476
00:14:48,450 --> 00:14:50,140
He's making it very obvious.

477
00:14:50,140 --> 00:14:52,010
I think Hyosung
is the female director.

478
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:55,750
I glanced at her during our break,

479
00:14:56,120 --> 00:14:57,760
and she had a suspicious gaze.

480
00:14:58,380 --> 00:14:59,760
I think it's Tae Oh and So Min.

481
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:00,860
(Kwang Soo suspects these two.)

482
00:15:00,860 --> 00:15:04,150
I have no idea
who the national actor is.

483
00:15:04,830 --> 00:15:06,960
I hope Kyung-hwan
is one of the directors.

484
00:15:06,960 --> 00:15:09,230
That way,
he'll get some screen time.

485
00:15:09,230 --> 00:15:10,370
(This is a wish of his.)

486
00:15:11,100 --> 00:15:15,060
This is my last chance
to get my screen time.

487
00:15:15,560 --> 00:15:18,300
If this doesn't work,
and you guys invite me again,

488
00:15:18,340 --> 00:15:19,610
I won't come back.

489
00:15:19,610 --> 00:15:20,670
(He's more focused
on gaining more screen time.)

490
00:15:20,670 --> 00:15:22,750
- This is my last chance.
- The race will begin now.

491
00:15:22,750 --> 00:15:23,770
(The announcement
for the start of the race is given.)

492
00:15:23,770 --> 00:15:24,770
Five,

493
00:15:24,850 --> 00:15:25,880
four,

494
00:15:25,950 --> 00:15:26,950
three,

495
00:15:27,380 --> 00:15:28,380
two,

496
00:15:28,640 --> 00:15:29,720
one.

497
00:15:30,380 --> 00:15:32,510
You may begin.

498
00:15:32,510 --> 00:15:35,230
Where should I go?

499
00:15:35,230 --> 00:15:36,230
What are you doing?

500
00:15:36,230 --> 00:15:37,730
I'm searching.

501
00:15:37,730 --> 00:15:39,790
I'm looking for hints.

502
00:15:40,100 --> 00:15:41,160
You're an actor, right?

503
00:15:41,160 --> 00:15:42,160
(He asks
a straightforward question.)

504
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:43,230
Yes.

505
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,060
(Yes, so what?)

506
00:15:46,700 --> 00:15:47,870
I don't need to worry
about you then.

507
00:15:47,870 --> 00:15:48,900
(He's daunted.)

508
00:15:49,400 --> 00:15:50,670
Why? What about you?

509
00:15:50,900 --> 00:15:52,130
I'm an actor too.

510
00:15:52,610 --> 00:15:54,480
- In which genre?
- What?

511
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:55,750
Variety shows.

512
00:15:55,900 --> 00:15:56,980
I act in variety shows.

513
00:15:56,980 --> 00:15:59,450
If you're a national actor,
let me know so I'll protect you.

514
00:15:59,450 --> 00:16:00,450
Of course.

515
00:16:00,450 --> 00:16:02,220
Wait, there's a hint.

516
00:16:02,850 --> 00:16:04,590
(Kyung-hwan finds a hint.)

517
00:16:05,150 --> 00:16:06,550
There's a hint. Okay.

518
00:16:06,550 --> 00:16:08,730
- Let's read it together.
- No, we shouldn't.

519
00:16:08,730 --> 00:16:10,420
That's how we do it.

520
00:16:10,420 --> 00:16:12,420
We always share the hints.

521
00:16:12,420 --> 00:16:13,420
(Brushing off stubbornly)

522
00:16:13,730 --> 00:16:15,160
- What was that?
- Fine.

523
00:16:15,160 --> 00:16:18,260
- What? This is fine.
- Okay, okay.

524
00:16:18,260 --> 00:16:19,430
Let's see.

525
00:16:19,700 --> 00:16:22,260
"Director A
is a Running Man member."

526
00:16:22,260 --> 00:16:24,830
(Director A
is a Running Man member.)

527
00:16:25,240 --> 00:16:27,710
(Director A
is a Running Man member.)

528
00:16:27,710 --> 00:16:30,150
It's not me, see?
It's a Running Man member.

529
00:16:30,150 --> 00:16:31,750
But we don't know
who Director B is.

530
00:16:31,750 --> 00:16:34,810
- I see.
- Director A could be a female.

531
00:16:35,510 --> 00:16:37,720
Why do you think Director A
is a male?

532
00:16:38,890 --> 00:16:40,730
I have a lot of guy friends
who have blood type A.

533
00:16:40,730 --> 00:16:41,990
Anyway...

534
00:16:42,580 --> 00:16:44,930
Are you in bad condition?

535
00:16:44,930 --> 00:16:46,260
(Yes)

536
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,470
Where do I keep this?

537
00:16:48,470 --> 00:16:50,400
Someone's here. Hide it.

538
00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:52,260
(He hides it.)

539
00:16:52,670 --> 00:16:53,740
Ji Hyo.

540
00:16:53,740 --> 00:16:55,410
(Ji Hyo is also suspected
of being a director.)

541
00:16:55,410 --> 00:16:57,100
- Have you been well?
- Yes.

542
00:16:57,100 --> 00:16:58,740
You just saw her a while ago.

543
00:16:58,740 --> 00:17:00,510
I bet it'll come down...

544
00:17:00,510 --> 00:17:02,370
- to either So Min or me.
- Why do you say that?

545
00:17:03,100 --> 00:17:05,920
- That was random.
- Those two are similar.

546
00:17:05,920 --> 00:17:07,840
Yoyomi was excluded,
so it's Hyosung, me,

547
00:17:07,840 --> 00:17:08,990
- or So Min.
- So Min.

548
00:17:08,990 --> 00:17:11,350
I'm certain it's not me,
so I suspect them.

549
00:17:11,350 --> 00:17:14,490
If it's one of them, I pick So Min.

550
00:17:14,490 --> 00:17:16,990
And back at the bus...

551
00:17:16,990 --> 00:17:18,020
(Ji Hyo suspects So Min.)

552
00:17:18,020 --> 00:17:19,430
So Min seemed suspicious.

553
00:17:19,430 --> 00:17:21,020
If So Min was the director,
wouldn't it be too easy?

554
00:17:21,020 --> 00:17:22,860
(Why is she suddenly accusing her?)

555
00:17:23,230 --> 00:17:25,240
(Jae Suk gets into the elevator.)

556
00:17:25,240 --> 00:17:26,330
Which floor are you going to?

557
00:17:27,670 --> 00:17:29,760
Hey. Hey!

558
00:17:30,510 --> 00:17:32,910
(It's so fun to tease Kwang Soo.)

559
00:17:33,980 --> 00:17:35,710
What's wrong with him?

560
00:17:36,070 --> 00:17:37,540
Why is he acting this way?

561
00:17:37,540 --> 00:17:38,610
That was hilarious.

562
00:17:38,610 --> 00:17:39,920
(This is worse than getting
your text messages ignored.)

563
00:17:39,920 --> 00:17:42,150
My time with Kwang Woo
is always fun.

564
00:17:42,150 --> 00:17:44,010
(Now that he's had his fun,)

565
00:17:44,010 --> 00:17:45,810
(he looks around for the hints.)

566
00:17:45,810 --> 00:17:46,810
What?

567
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:50,460
(He finds a box with an R sticker.)

568
00:17:51,020 --> 00:17:52,090
What is this?

569
00:17:52,090 --> 00:17:54,230
(What could it be?)

570
00:17:55,020 --> 00:17:56,060
What is this?

571
00:17:56,060 --> 00:17:57,120
(It's a tablet.)

572
00:17:57,120 --> 00:17:58,260
It's a tablet.

573
00:17:58,470 --> 00:18:00,400
Is this the hint?

574
00:18:02,760 --> 00:18:05,410
I am Kim Yoon Sang
of "That I Want to Know".

575
00:18:05,910 --> 00:18:08,270
(What is "That I Want to Know"?)

576
00:18:08,270 --> 00:18:10,650
In order to find out the truth...

577
00:18:10,650 --> 00:18:12,920
about these two directors,
we've talked...

578
00:18:12,920 --> 00:18:14,610
with their close associates.

579
00:18:15,420 --> 00:18:18,850
I know Director A.

580
00:18:18,850 --> 00:18:20,460
How do I put it?

581
00:18:20,580 --> 00:18:22,160
I think I could say this.

582
00:18:22,390 --> 00:18:25,090
"Running Man's fan-meet",
"tears".

583
00:18:25,090 --> 00:18:27,020
"Running Man's fan-meet",
"tears"?

584
00:18:28,520 --> 00:18:31,860
One of the directors is related
to tears.

585
00:18:31,860 --> 00:18:34,710
Who is Director A?

586
00:18:35,670 --> 00:18:38,530
I got this. I know who it is.

587
00:18:38,530 --> 00:18:39,770
(Jae Suk knows who it is.)

588
00:18:39,770 --> 00:18:40,800
Goodness.

589
00:18:40,980 --> 00:18:42,210
Did you get a hint?

590
00:18:42,840 --> 00:18:44,180
I can't read it.

591
00:18:44,180 --> 00:18:45,540
They have dignity?

592
00:18:46,750 --> 00:18:47,750
(She misreads "director"
as "dignity".)

593
00:18:47,750 --> 00:18:49,650
How could you misread this?

594
00:18:49,720 --> 00:18:51,690
- Is it dignity?
- Who cried during the fan-meet?

595
00:18:52,920 --> 00:18:54,050
Who was it?

596
00:18:54,050 --> 00:18:55,280
(Who cried during the fan-meet?)

597
00:18:55,280 --> 00:18:56,320
I'm dying to know.

598
00:18:56,660 --> 00:18:58,460
- I want to search it up online.
- It's Ji Hyo.

599
00:18:58,460 --> 00:18:59,960
(Ji Hyo was the one who cried.)

600
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:04,030
(During the fan-meet,
Ji Hyo shed tears.)

601
00:19:04,030 --> 00:19:07,170
(Does this mean
she's one of the directors?)

602
00:19:07,170 --> 00:19:08,330
- Ji Hyo.
- Yes?

603
00:19:08,330 --> 00:19:09,640
(He immediately goes to her.)

604
00:19:09,640 --> 00:19:11,140
I found a hint.

605
00:19:11,140 --> 00:19:12,210
Was it about me?

606
00:19:12,210 --> 00:19:14,540
It read "Running Man's fan-meet",
"tears".

607
00:19:14,540 --> 00:19:16,410
It's really not me.

608
00:19:17,310 --> 00:19:20,420
- This is too obvious.
- I'm serious.

609
00:19:21,150 --> 00:19:24,280
I'm just frustrated that's all.
It's seriously not me.

610
00:19:24,280 --> 00:19:25,720
- Let go of me.
- It isn't me.

611
00:19:25,720 --> 00:19:26,810
Don't be clingy.

612
00:19:27,490 --> 00:19:29,280
- Yoo Jae Suk!
- Go away.

613
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:31,820
You'll pay
if you leave me like this.

614
00:19:31,820 --> 00:19:33,660
- Don't follow me.
- It isn't me.

615
00:19:33,660 --> 00:19:35,620
- Don't come any closer.
- It isn't me!

616
00:19:35,620 --> 00:19:36,860
Be quiet.

617
00:19:37,330 --> 00:19:39,290
Unbelievable.

618
00:19:39,970 --> 00:19:42,260
I knew I'd be suspected this way.

619
00:19:43,410 --> 00:19:44,530
(Who's the national actor?)

620
00:19:44,530 --> 00:19:47,840
Is everyone
thinking of the same person?

621
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:49,100
(They only know about
the directors right now,)

622
00:19:49,100 --> 00:19:50,370
(but So Min spots something.)

623
00:19:50,370 --> 00:19:53,270
(Who is the hint about?)

624
00:19:53,270 --> 00:19:56,810
(The national actor's age
doesn't include the number 9.)

625
00:19:57,310 --> 00:19:59,490
(In 2019, Kyung-hwan and Ji Hyo
were both 39.)

626
00:20:00,190 --> 00:20:02,690
(Neither Kyung-hwan nor Ji Hyo
is the national actor.)

627
00:20:02,690 --> 00:20:04,320
"Doesn't include..."

628
00:20:04,520 --> 00:20:06,200
- Did you find something?
- A hint.

629
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:08,320
(It's Ji Hyo who many
suspect as a director.)

630
00:20:08,820 --> 00:20:09,970
What did it say?

631
00:20:11,470 --> 00:20:14,010
Wait, hold on.

632
00:20:14,740 --> 00:20:15,970
You're just leaving?

633
00:20:16,210 --> 00:20:17,740
I can't show you this.

634
00:20:17,740 --> 00:20:19,030
- It's fine.
- I'd only show you...

635
00:20:19,030 --> 00:20:20,800
- if I'm a director.
- I've been suspecting you,

636
00:20:20,800 --> 00:20:22,300
- so you're not showing me...
- Look.

637
00:20:22,300 --> 00:20:24,220
It's about the national actor,
so what if you're a director?

638
00:20:24,220 --> 00:20:27,110
I'm just an actor,
so I should help the national actor.

639
00:20:27,110 --> 00:20:28,950
One of the directors is female.

640
00:20:28,950 --> 00:20:30,810
(Does she want to know so that she
can eliminate the national actor?)

641
00:20:30,810 --> 00:20:32,920
(Meanwhile, Haha
is still searching for hints.)

642
00:20:33,890 --> 00:20:35,390
(He spots something.)

643
00:20:36,260 --> 00:20:37,930
(He finds a box with the R logo.)

644
00:20:37,930 --> 00:20:39,200
What's this?

645
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:40,550
(It's a tablet
that contains a video.)

646
00:20:40,550 --> 00:20:41,670
Hold on.

647
00:20:42,020 --> 00:20:44,530
I am Kim Yoon Sang
of "That I Want to Know".

648
00:20:45,140 --> 00:20:47,000
The two directors
desperately want to know...

649
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:48,800
the identity of the national actor.

650
00:20:48,800 --> 00:20:52,510
I met with a close acquaintance
of this person.

651
00:20:52,710 --> 00:20:54,180
Maybe it's a quality
of a national actor.

652
00:20:54,180 --> 00:20:55,910
This person is generous
and is a skillful actor.

653
00:20:55,910 --> 00:20:58,420
I almost forgot.
This person goes by a stage name.

654
00:20:58,420 --> 00:21:00,370
(The national actor
goes by a stage name?)

655
00:21:00,370 --> 00:21:02,250
I don't mind this person's
actual name though.

656
00:21:02,250 --> 00:21:05,580
This person goes by a stage name.

657
00:21:06,490 --> 00:21:08,690
So who is this national actor?

658
00:21:09,820 --> 00:21:11,290
(Someone with a stage name...)

659
00:21:11,290 --> 00:21:12,730
(who isn't of an age
that includes a 9.)

660
00:21:12,730 --> 00:21:14,400
This is huge.

661
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:16,020
(National actor candidates:
Kang Tae Oh, Haha, Yoyomi)

662
00:21:16,120 --> 00:21:19,360
This was the biggest hint ever.

663
00:21:19,500 --> 00:21:21,910
This seems weird. Wait, what's that?

664
00:21:23,640 --> 00:21:24,910
Haha, did you find a hint?

665
00:21:24,910 --> 00:21:26,100
Not at all. What was that?

666
00:21:26,100 --> 00:21:27,210
- Did you find a hint?
- Yes.

667
00:21:27,210 --> 00:21:28,600
Regarding whom?

668
00:21:29,300 --> 00:21:31,180
I have more on the national actor.

669
00:21:31,420 --> 00:21:32,980
- The national actor?
- What about you?

670
00:21:33,220 --> 00:21:37,150
I have two regarding
the national actor...

671
00:21:37,220 --> 00:21:38,220
and one about the directors.

672
00:21:38,220 --> 00:21:39,550
- Tell me about the directors.
- What are you though?

673
00:21:39,550 --> 00:21:41,690
- Are you just an actor?
- Yes.

674
00:21:42,120 --> 00:21:43,690
- What about you?
- I've...

675
00:21:43,690 --> 00:21:46,230
seen you lie on TV too much
that I can't trust you.

676
00:21:46,230 --> 00:21:47,230
Whatever. Forget about it.

677
00:21:47,230 --> 00:21:48,700
(Subtly)

678
00:21:48,700 --> 00:21:49,820
Forget about it.

679
00:21:49,820 --> 00:21:51,330
(Tae Oh tried
to rip of Haha's name tag.)

680
00:21:51,700 --> 00:21:53,400
What?
Why are you making me look bad?

681
00:21:53,400 --> 00:21:54,970
I felt your hand just now.

682
00:21:54,970 --> 00:21:56,830
Anyway, share whatever you find.

683
00:21:57,260 --> 00:21:58,910
You're being very suspicious though.

684
00:22:00,100 --> 00:22:02,100
(He's acting super suspicious.)

685
00:22:03,100 --> 00:22:06,270
(Haha follows Tae Oh.)

686
00:22:06,510 --> 00:22:07,580
Are you sure?

687
00:22:07,580 --> 00:22:08,920
(Out of the blue)

688
00:22:09,540 --> 00:22:11,780
- Sorry?
- I'll tell you what I know.

689
00:22:12,550 --> 00:22:13,720
It's hard to guess who though.

690
00:22:13,720 --> 00:22:15,850
- Write this down.
- Sure.

691
00:22:15,850 --> 00:22:17,120
(While Tae Oh is preoccupied)

692
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:18,930
(Ripping)

693
00:22:20,230 --> 00:22:22,860
(While his guard was down)

694
00:22:22,860 --> 00:22:24,440
(A blitz attack)

695
00:22:24,790 --> 00:22:26,740
(Haha eliminates Tae Oh
who could be a director.)

696
00:22:26,740 --> 00:22:27,910
I'm sorry, Tae Oh.

697
00:22:27,910 --> 00:22:29,800
I know that you're
the national actor.

698
00:22:29,800 --> 00:22:32,030
(I know that you're
the national actor.)

699
00:22:32,300 --> 00:22:35,270
(You think I'm the national actor?)

700
00:22:36,370 --> 00:22:39,480
(This morning, they all checked
the roles they were playing.)

701
00:22:39,480 --> 00:22:41,110
(Haha...)

702
00:22:41,110 --> 00:22:44,610
(is a director!)

703
00:22:44,610 --> 00:22:47,010
(Haha was chosen
for the role of a director.)

704
00:22:47,010 --> 00:22:48,320
You're the national actor, right?

705
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:51,320
(Haha guessed it was Tae Oh
because he uses a stage name.)

706
00:22:51,320 --> 00:22:52,400
You're just an actor?

707
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:53,660
(The twist)

708
00:22:53,660 --> 00:22:55,790
- Unbelievable.
- You're not the national actor?

709
00:22:55,790 --> 00:22:57,590
(Tae Oh acted suspiciously all day,)

710
00:22:58,140 --> 00:22:59,790
(but he wasn't a director
nor the national actor.)

711
00:22:59,790 --> 00:23:01,140
(He was just an actor.)

712
00:23:01,140 --> 00:23:03,470
(Actor)

713
00:23:03,800 --> 00:23:07,140
But you use a stage name
just like me and Yoyomi.

714
00:23:08,100 --> 00:23:10,010
I was too naive.

715
00:23:10,010 --> 00:23:12,340
Sorry, Tae Oh. I'll explain later.

716
00:23:12,370 --> 00:23:13,720
No way.

717
00:23:14,340 --> 00:23:16,390
Does it always end in vain?

718
00:23:17,080 --> 00:23:18,510
What's up?

719
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:21,320
(Haha comes across Jae Suk.)

720
00:23:21,780 --> 00:23:23,690
(Haha laughs awkwardly.)

721
00:23:23,690 --> 00:23:25,400
You won't believe it.

722
00:23:25,400 --> 00:23:27,620
I learned about the national actor.

723
00:23:27,730 --> 00:23:29,230
- You found a hint?
- The biggest one ever.

724
00:23:29,470 --> 00:23:31,440
(He must've found it over here.)

725
00:23:31,700 --> 00:23:33,400
- What now?
- Gosh.

726
00:23:34,360 --> 00:23:35,740
Kang Tae Oh has been eliminated.

727
00:23:36,060 --> 00:23:37,170
(Jae Suk spots Tae Oh
who was just eliminated.)

728
00:23:37,170 --> 00:23:38,370
Kang Tae Oh has been eliminated.

729
00:23:38,370 --> 00:23:39,410
You've been eliminated?

730
00:23:39,410 --> 00:23:41,950
Actor Kang Tae Oh
has been eliminated.

731
00:23:41,950 --> 00:23:43,040
Wait.

732
00:23:43,270 --> 00:23:44,540
Please get him.

733
00:23:44,540 --> 00:23:45,680
(Only those with a special role
can eliminate others.)

734
00:23:45,680 --> 00:23:47,950
Actor Kang Tae Oh
has been eliminated.

735
00:23:47,950 --> 00:23:49,010
- What?
- What?

736
00:23:49,010 --> 00:23:50,780
- Tae Oh was eliminated?
- Tae Oh?

737
00:23:50,780 --> 00:23:52,990
- It's Haha.
- It's obvious now.

738
00:23:53,010 --> 00:23:54,010
(They suspect those
who aren't here with them.)

739
00:23:54,010 --> 00:23:55,230
That narrows it down.

740
00:23:55,230 --> 00:23:56,660
I suspect Haha.

741
00:23:56,660 --> 00:23:57,760
Did you eliminate Tae Oh?

742
00:23:58,500 --> 00:24:00,730
(Haha was caught red-handed.)

743
00:24:00,730 --> 00:24:01,790
I'm the national actor.

744
00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:04,860
- What?
- I know something huge.

745
00:24:04,940 --> 00:24:07,600
Why was Tae Oh eliminated
when he was only with you?

746
00:24:08,440 --> 00:24:11,530
I thought that he was a director.

747
00:24:12,100 --> 00:24:15,210
I'm telling the truth.
I know something huge.

748
00:24:15,210 --> 00:24:16,840
- I'm not lying.
- 30 minutes have passed.

749
00:24:16,840 --> 00:24:19,810
- Please gather at the court.
- We'll see at the trial.

750
00:24:19,810 --> 00:24:21,010
I'm sure of it.

751
00:24:21,010 --> 00:24:22,420
You should head to the court.

752
00:24:22,420 --> 00:24:23,780
- The court.
- He was faking it.

753
00:24:23,780 --> 00:24:25,280
We should continue this later on.

754
00:24:25,280 --> 00:24:27,260
- Let's head to court first.
- Jae Suk, trust me.

755
00:24:27,420 --> 00:24:28,520
You really should.

756
00:24:28,690 --> 00:24:31,290
If I could,
I would show you the video.

757
00:24:31,290 --> 00:24:33,230
(What will happen
at the first trial?)

758
00:24:33,460 --> 00:24:35,820
I know it's confusing, but trust me.

759
00:24:35,820 --> 00:24:37,590
So you're the national actor?

760
00:24:37,740 --> 00:24:39,900
Gosh, keep it down!

761
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:42,600
- Gosh.
- You shouldn't say anything.

762
00:24:42,600 --> 00:24:43,710
I don't believe you though.

763
00:24:43,710 --> 00:24:44,770
Jae Suk!

764
00:24:44,770 --> 00:24:46,300
(The others arrive at court.)

765
00:24:46,300 --> 00:24:47,600
Who eliminated Tae Oh?

766
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:50,040
- Who eliminated him?
- Who was it?

767
00:24:50,040 --> 00:24:51,070
Tae Oh...

768
00:24:51,150 --> 00:24:54,490
Actor Kang Tae Oh was eliminated.

769
00:24:54,490 --> 00:24:56,420
Now, we will commence
the first trial.

770
00:24:56,420 --> 00:25:00,110
Please discuss among yourselves
and put one person on trial.

771
00:25:00,110 --> 00:25:02,230
I witnessed it.

772
00:25:02,230 --> 00:25:03,230
What happened?

773
00:25:03,780 --> 00:25:05,790
Haha and Tae Oh were together,

774
00:25:06,290 --> 00:25:07,930
but Tae Oh was eliminated.

775
00:25:07,930 --> 00:25:08,930
(The witness testifies.)

776
00:25:09,500 --> 00:25:11,240
(Haha pretends to be unfazed.)

777
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:13,530
- What?
- Then it's obvious.

778
00:25:14,170 --> 00:25:16,100
(All he does is nod.)

779
00:25:16,100 --> 00:25:17,300
(Haha seems unfazed.)

780
00:25:17,300 --> 00:25:19,910
That's the expression he holds
when situations get awkward.

781
00:25:19,910 --> 00:25:22,040
(Jong Kook pretends
to be perceptive.)

782
00:25:23,250 --> 00:25:25,010
It's why I'm not saying anything.

783
00:25:25,010 --> 00:25:26,570
I'll only speak if I'm on trial.

784
00:25:26,570 --> 00:25:27,950
- I...
- That's right.

785
00:25:28,110 --> 00:25:30,110
I'm worried because
he could be the national actor.

786
00:25:30,110 --> 00:25:33,280
He could've thought that
Tae Oh was a director.

787
00:25:33,280 --> 00:25:34,930
I think we should protect him.

788
00:25:34,930 --> 00:25:35,930
It's definitely a risk.

789
00:25:35,930 --> 00:25:38,430
I have a feeling that
Haha's the national actor.

790
00:25:38,430 --> 00:25:40,930
He never puts on
a serious expression like that.

791
00:25:40,930 --> 00:25:44,120
There's a hint
that we all know though.

792
00:25:44,120 --> 00:25:47,290
It read "Running Man's fan-meet",
"tears".

793
00:25:47,290 --> 00:25:48,910
The hint that Jae Suk found.

794
00:25:48,910 --> 00:25:51,800
I'm confused because
that points to Ji Hyo.

795
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:52,980
I saw that too,

796
00:25:52,980 --> 00:25:57,510
but the hints point
to Ji Hyo too directly...

797
00:25:57,510 --> 00:26:00,110
which is why we should
let her be for now.

798
00:26:00,110 --> 00:26:01,840
- So it's not her?
- It might not be.

799
00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:03,690
- It's to throw us off?
- How about this?

800
00:26:03,690 --> 00:26:07,510
Why don't we start by
narrowing down the female director?

801
00:26:07,510 --> 00:26:08,780
It has to be one of you.

802
00:26:08,780 --> 00:26:10,760
Yes, there are only
three possibilities.

803
00:26:10,760 --> 00:26:14,430
I spotted a lady
who let something slip by mistake.

804
00:26:14,430 --> 00:26:15,790
- What?
- In what way?

805
00:26:15,860 --> 00:26:17,290
It was Jeon So Min.

806
00:26:18,140 --> 00:26:19,330
(I let something slip?)

807
00:26:19,330 --> 00:26:22,600
I told her about "tears"
being a hint that indicates...

808
00:26:22,600 --> 00:26:23,600
who the director is,

809
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:25,770
but she claimed that tears
have never been...

810
00:26:25,770 --> 00:26:27,180
a hint to anything over three years.

811
00:26:27,180 --> 00:26:29,910
They never have been.
It hasn't happened before.

812
00:26:29,910 --> 00:26:31,480
Have you ever seen a hint like that?

813
00:26:31,720 --> 00:26:33,810
Then as she passed me,

814
00:26:34,390 --> 00:26:37,960
she said to herself that she has
never cried on the show.

815
00:26:39,160 --> 00:26:42,230
(Is Kyung-hwan telling the truth?)

816
00:26:42,230 --> 00:26:45,790
(Like he said,
he shared the hint with So Min.)

817
00:26:45,790 --> 00:26:48,230
(She didn't realize
she was saying it.)

818
00:26:48,230 --> 00:26:50,200
(I never cried at the fan-meet.)

819
00:26:50,900 --> 00:26:53,500
(Kyung-hwan was right!)

820
00:26:53,500 --> 00:26:55,100
(Suspicious)

821
00:26:55,640 --> 00:26:58,830
(Did So Min make a huge mistake?)

822
00:26:59,330 --> 00:27:02,800
"I didn't cry, so how come
I'm one of the directors?"

823
00:27:03,010 --> 00:27:04,720
I've never cried on the show before.

824
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:08,750
To be honest, I find it weird
not to put Ji Hyo on trial...

825
00:27:08,750 --> 00:27:10,720
after learning
what the hints indicated.

826
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:13,350
- You're right.
- The staff of Running Man...

827
00:27:13,350 --> 00:27:16,120
would've written that
to indicate So Min.

828
00:27:16,120 --> 00:27:18,020
- As a twist?
- Yes, it's So Min.

829
00:27:18,020 --> 00:27:19,620
- I think it was to throw us off.
- Right?

830
00:27:19,620 --> 00:27:20,620
Don't you agree?

831
00:27:20,620 --> 00:27:22,320
What about this then?

832
00:27:22,700 --> 00:27:24,400
Let's put two
of the ladies on trial.

833
00:27:24,400 --> 00:27:26,400
(He didn't fully
comprehend the rules.)

834
00:27:27,090 --> 00:27:28,470
- What?
- Only one can be on trial.

835
00:27:28,940 --> 00:27:30,170
- Kwang Soo?
- Hold on.

836
00:27:30,170 --> 00:27:31,370
Seriously?

837
00:27:31,370 --> 00:27:32,370
Hold on then.

838
00:27:32,370 --> 00:27:34,300
Why don't we just put
three people on trial?

839
00:27:35,340 --> 00:27:37,210
- Unbelievable.
- I'm sorry.

840
00:27:37,210 --> 00:27:39,610
I think it's right
to put So Min on trial first.

841
00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:41,040
Me? That's out of the blue.

842
00:27:41,040 --> 00:27:44,040
I find So Min suspicious.

843
00:27:44,040 --> 00:27:46,720
Also, she hasn't said anything
up until now.

844
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:48,280
There's nothing to say.

845
00:27:48,280 --> 00:27:51,120
Then make a rebuttal
and convince us otherwise.

846
00:27:51,230 --> 00:27:52,320
Well...

847
00:27:52,320 --> 00:27:54,730
We need to fish out
one of the directors.

848
00:27:54,730 --> 00:27:57,430
I think it's best
to find the female director first.

849
00:27:57,430 --> 00:27:59,830
- Right.
- Then let's take a vote...

850
00:27:59,970 --> 00:28:02,100
and put whoever receives
the most votes on trial.

851
00:28:02,100 --> 00:28:03,260
He's right.

852
00:28:03,260 --> 00:28:05,510
The person with the most votes
will be put on trial.

853
00:28:05,510 --> 00:28:07,950
- Okay.
- Then I'll write my own name.

854
00:28:07,950 --> 00:28:09,010
- What?
- Why?

855
00:28:09,010 --> 00:28:10,010
Go ahead and see who I am.

856
00:28:10,010 --> 00:28:12,150
- She's taking a risk.
- Exactly.

857
00:28:12,150 --> 00:28:15,610
She's taking a huge risk
to clear her name.

858
00:28:15,610 --> 00:28:17,280
Go ahead and vote then.

859
00:28:18,190 --> 00:28:19,550
Go ahead and vote then.

860
00:28:19,550 --> 00:28:21,280
What? I should place my vote?

861
00:28:21,280 --> 00:28:22,430
Yes, place your vote.

862
00:28:23,960 --> 00:28:27,500
- If I do, will you trust me?
- So Min, you're pushing it.

863
00:28:27,500 --> 00:28:28,970
- What if it is you?
- I'm...

864
00:28:28,970 --> 00:28:32,240
Jae Suk wrote down your name and
is walking over to place his vote.

865
00:28:32,440 --> 00:28:34,060
- Guys.
- Can you place mine for me?

866
00:28:34,060 --> 00:28:36,360
Vote for me then.
Just know, that it isn't me.

867
00:28:36,360 --> 00:28:37,760
(She checks Jong Kook's ballot.)

868
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:40,300
- It really isn't me.
- Place my vote for me.

869
00:28:40,300 --> 00:28:42,650
- But it isn't me.
- Place my vote, please.

870
00:28:42,650 --> 00:28:43,840
- So Min, here.
- I hear you.

871
00:28:44,650 --> 00:28:45,650
- I'm sorry.
- "Jeon So..."

872
00:28:45,650 --> 00:28:47,920
But all the hints point to Ji Hyo.

873
00:28:47,920 --> 00:28:49,010
- Wait.
- Place my vote.

874
00:28:49,010 --> 00:28:50,780
I swear that it isn't me.

875
00:28:50,780 --> 00:28:52,690
If So Min isn't the director,

876
00:28:52,690 --> 00:28:54,690
we should have the national actor...

877
00:28:54,690 --> 00:28:56,320
eliminate Ji Hyo and Yoyomi.

878
00:28:56,320 --> 00:28:59,200
- Exactly. Jong Kook's right.
- Right?

879
00:28:59,230 --> 00:29:00,430
Sure, got it.

880
00:29:00,430 --> 00:29:01,820
Here's the result.

881
00:29:01,820 --> 00:29:05,240
So Min received
9 votes out of 11...

882
00:29:05,240 --> 00:29:06,240
(The voting result)

883
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:08,510
(So Min will be put on trial.)

884
00:29:08,510 --> 00:29:10,260
- Please stand on the platform.
- So Min, please head out.

885
00:29:10,260 --> 00:29:12,210
(Sighing)

886
00:29:12,210 --> 00:29:14,510
We have no other choice.
It's a process of elimination.

887
00:29:14,510 --> 00:29:17,250
I don't get why no one wrote down...

888
00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:19,420
Hyosung's name.

889
00:29:19,420 --> 00:29:20,610
I doubt it's her.

890
00:29:20,610 --> 00:29:22,450
- There are no hints on me.
- We have no hints about her.

891
00:29:22,490 --> 00:29:24,660
But if So Min turns out
not to be a director...

892
00:29:24,760 --> 00:29:26,080
If she turns out
not to be a director...

893
00:29:26,490 --> 00:29:28,730
Then it's either Ji Hyo
or Hyosung.

894
00:29:28,730 --> 00:29:30,020
(Could Ji Hyo or Hyosung
be a director?)

895
00:29:30,020 --> 00:29:31,160
I'll rip it off now.

896
00:29:31,160 --> 00:29:32,350
(So Min's identity
will be revealed.)

897
00:29:32,350 --> 00:29:33,500
Let's do it.

898
00:29:33,660 --> 00:29:38,290
(Because of Kyung-hwan's testimony,
their fates have changed.)

899
00:29:38,290 --> 00:29:42,100
(What is So Min's identity?)

900
00:29:42,100 --> 00:29:43,140
- What is it?
- What is it?

901
00:29:44,600 --> 00:29:45,910
- What is it?
- She is a director!

902
00:29:46,030 --> 00:29:47,410
I told you!

903
00:29:47,510 --> 00:29:49,150
(I got caught.)

904
00:29:49,750 --> 00:29:50,800
(The director was not Ji Hyo,
but So Min.)

905
00:29:50,800 --> 00:29:52,370
I told you, right?

906
00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:54,070
(Shocked)

907
00:29:54,070 --> 00:29:55,310
So Min!

908
00:29:55,750 --> 00:29:58,110
Gosh, I can't trust you anymore.

909
00:29:58,260 --> 00:30:00,050
Seriously.

910
00:30:00,050 --> 00:30:02,660
(There is only one director
to catch now.)

911
00:30:02,660 --> 00:30:03,690
Guys, listen.

912
00:30:03,730 --> 00:30:05,900
So Min, an actor who has been
playing a director,

913
00:30:05,900 --> 00:30:07,900
is out now.

914
00:30:08,200 --> 00:30:11,060
So Min, who is an actor, is out.

915
00:30:11,760 --> 00:30:14,860
(Is So Min an actor?)

916
00:30:15,910 --> 00:30:17,530
So Min, who is a fake director,

917
00:30:17,530 --> 00:30:20,140
- is out.
- A fake director?

918
00:30:20,410 --> 00:30:21,600
What do you mean?

919
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:24,340
(What is going on?)

920
00:30:25,450 --> 00:30:27,220
(Underneath her name tag,)

921
00:30:27,220 --> 00:30:29,190
(it said, "Actor whose role
is a director.")

922
00:30:29,720 --> 00:30:33,110
(So Min is not a female director.)

923
00:30:33,110 --> 00:30:35,350
So Min, who is an actor, is out.

924
00:30:35,350 --> 00:30:36,990
She is an actor?

925
00:30:38,200 --> 00:30:39,500
- What?
- Oh, that's right.

926
00:30:39,500 --> 00:30:41,050
It says, "actor".

927
00:30:41,160 --> 00:30:42,260
Her role is a director.

928
00:30:42,260 --> 00:30:43,590
- She is an actor?
- What are you talking about?

929
00:30:43,620 --> 00:30:44,670
What's going on?

930
00:30:44,670 --> 00:30:46,590
She is an actor
whose role is a director.

931
00:30:46,590 --> 00:30:47,940
- What?
- What?

932
00:30:47,940 --> 00:30:49,300
- Then why...
- She plays a director...

933
00:30:49,300 --> 00:30:51,140
in the movie.

934
00:30:51,240 --> 00:30:53,330
- What's with her face?
- Why did you do that?

935
00:30:53,330 --> 00:30:55,270
- Are you a director or an actor?
- Aren't I a director?

936
00:30:55,840 --> 00:30:56,950
I don't know.

937
00:30:57,010 --> 00:31:00,180
- So Min...
- She thinks she is a director.

938
00:31:00,920 --> 00:31:02,010
What is going on?

939
00:31:02,010 --> 00:31:03,250
The staff tricked us.

940
00:31:03,280 --> 00:31:05,720
- There must be a twist.
- Something doesn't feel right.

941
00:31:05,720 --> 00:31:07,890
- Why is it so hard?
- What is this?

942
00:31:08,760 --> 00:31:09,930
All right.

943
00:31:10,020 --> 00:31:13,350
The court is adjourned.
Let's go back to the race.

944
00:31:13,350 --> 00:31:14,620
They may not know
what their roles are.

945
00:31:14,620 --> 00:31:16,260
Let's start the race again.

946
00:31:16,260 --> 00:31:17,760
She thinks she is a director.

947
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:19,240
(Will they find the real directors
and the national actor?)

948
00:31:19,860 --> 00:31:20,970
I can't believe the staff.

949
00:31:21,060 --> 00:31:22,260
I mean...

950
00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:23,940
I'm so angry.

951
00:31:24,210 --> 00:31:25,980
I'm really angry.

952
00:31:25,980 --> 00:31:27,330
(She feels victimized.)

953
00:31:28,100 --> 00:31:29,680
Are you out?

954
00:31:30,070 --> 00:31:31,570
- Are you out?
- I got fooled.

955
00:31:31,570 --> 00:31:33,110
(She still feels victimized.)

956
00:31:33,110 --> 00:31:34,220
I got fooled too.

957
00:31:34,340 --> 00:31:36,040
I worked so hard,
but it was only a test.

958
00:31:36,890 --> 00:31:39,350
While saying that,

959
00:31:39,390 --> 00:31:41,280
- your eyes look so sad.
- Really?

960
00:31:41,280 --> 00:31:43,350
You're smiling,

961
00:31:43,350 --> 00:31:45,000
but you look very sad.
Why is that?

962
00:31:45,960 --> 00:31:47,430
I'm glad that you know.

963
00:31:47,500 --> 00:31:48,900
I'm not just saying this.

964
00:31:48,900 --> 00:31:51,940
I didn't want to make you
feel uncomfortable,

965
00:31:52,240 --> 00:31:55,030
but I've always liked you a lot.

966
00:31:55,030 --> 00:31:56,970
(You've liked me a lot?)

967
00:31:56,970 --> 00:31:59,240
You're so charming on Running Man.

968
00:32:00,030 --> 00:32:01,140
I mean it.

969
00:32:01,140 --> 00:32:02,270
(So Min's heart flutters.)

970
00:32:02,410 --> 00:32:04,510
Maybe it's a good thing
that I got eliminated early.

971
00:32:04,510 --> 00:32:05,980
- Why?
- I can be here with you alone.

972
00:32:06,770 --> 00:32:08,490
(He feels a little uncomfortable.)

973
00:32:08,810 --> 00:32:10,110
Can you lock the door?

974
00:32:10,840 --> 00:32:12,080
I don't want anyone to come in.

975
00:32:12,580 --> 00:32:14,420
- You were so funny at that time.
- When?

976
00:32:14,420 --> 00:32:15,990
When your armpits got sweaty.

977
00:32:15,990 --> 00:32:18,760
(When your armpits got sweaty)

978
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:20,290
That was...

979
00:32:20,520 --> 00:32:21,860
That was hilarious.

980
00:32:22,970 --> 00:32:24,170
Did you see Yondu too?

981
00:32:24,900 --> 00:32:26,030
I saw everything.

982
00:32:26,030 --> 00:32:27,530
(He really is a huge fan.)

983
00:32:29,470 --> 00:32:31,480
There's the fish-shaped bun version,

984
00:32:31,570 --> 00:32:32,770
but did you see
the fan-meet version too?

985
00:32:32,770 --> 00:32:34,440
Like I said, I saw everything.

986
00:32:36,150 --> 00:32:37,370
(Hopeless)

987
00:32:37,370 --> 00:32:38,480
I see.

988
00:32:38,480 --> 00:32:39,570
It was so funny.

989
00:32:40,010 --> 00:32:43,040
I'm not teasing you though.

990
00:32:43,750 --> 00:32:46,050
Can you marry a woman
who looks like Yondu?

991
00:32:46,760 --> 00:32:48,930
(If I can marry her?)

992
00:32:51,730 --> 00:32:53,550
(You said you like me a lot.)

993
00:32:53,820 --> 00:32:55,060
Stop staring at me like that.
It's a bit uncomfortable.

994
00:32:55,060 --> 00:32:57,000
I'm not.

995
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:59,090
(Tae Oh doesn't want her
to get any wrong ideas.)

996
00:33:00,170 --> 00:33:02,060
Let's start the race again.

997
00:33:02,060 --> 00:33:03,740
(The race starts again.)

998
00:33:03,740 --> 00:33:04,910
This is crazy.

999
00:33:05,030 --> 00:33:06,710
So Min is not a director.

1000
00:33:07,510 --> 00:33:08,770
Then what am I?

1001
00:33:09,480 --> 00:33:10,680
(So Min is an actor
whose role is a director.)

1002
00:33:10,680 --> 00:33:11,680
I'm...

1003
00:33:13,370 --> 00:33:15,780
I'm an actor
whose role is a director,

1004
00:33:15,780 --> 00:33:17,250
just like her.

1005
00:33:17,690 --> 00:33:21,190
The tablet PC said...

1006
00:33:21,580 --> 00:33:24,020
the national actor
goes by a stage name.

1007
00:33:24,390 --> 00:33:25,430
The candidates
are Haha, Song Ji Hyo,

1008
00:33:25,430 --> 00:33:26,430
Kang Tae Oh, and Yoyomi.

1009
00:33:26,830 --> 00:33:29,200
It's not Ji Hyo, Tae Oh, or me.

1010
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:30,620
There was no reason
to eliminate Tae Oh.

1011
00:33:30,620 --> 00:33:32,270
(The only person left is...)

1012
00:33:32,270 --> 00:33:33,490
That leaves only Yoyomi.

1013
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:38,540
(Is Yoyomi the national actor
as the hint suggests?)

1014
00:33:39,540 --> 00:33:41,950
They will suspect me now.

1015
00:33:43,370 --> 00:33:45,850
(Ji Hyo will be suspected
of being a director now.)

1016
00:33:45,850 --> 00:33:47,740
They will definitely suspect me.

1017
00:33:47,740 --> 00:33:48,950
(Is Ji Hyo a director?)

1018
00:33:49,490 --> 00:33:51,950
Let's hope the new hint...

1019
00:33:52,890 --> 00:33:54,520
will help us.

1020
00:33:54,520 --> 00:33:56,080
I have to find a hint.

1021
00:33:56,080 --> 00:33:57,120
(Everyone is looking for a hint.)

1022
00:33:58,430 --> 00:34:01,390
(Yoyomi, a national actor candidate,
finds something.)

1023
00:34:01,390 --> 00:34:04,470
(It's a hint.)

1024
00:34:07,160 --> 00:34:10,640
(Director A is not
in his or her 40s.)

1025
00:34:11,140 --> 00:34:14,010
(According to the hints
found so far,)

1026
00:34:14,010 --> 00:34:16,080
(Director A is
a Running Man member...)

1027
00:34:16,080 --> 00:34:17,600
(who is not in his or her 40s.)

1028
00:34:17,600 --> 00:34:19,870
(The candidates are...)

1029
00:34:19,870 --> 00:34:23,450
(Se Chan, Suk Jin,
Kwang Soo, and Ji Hyo.)

1030
00:34:24,350 --> 00:34:28,560
(Among them, who is a director?)

1031
00:34:30,060 --> 00:34:31,700
Does Kwang Soo have a role?

1032
00:34:31,850 --> 00:34:33,490
I don't think so.

1033
00:34:33,560 --> 00:34:34,720
- Me?
- Yes.

1034
00:34:34,990 --> 00:34:37,600
- Did you meet the staff earlier?
- No.

1035
00:34:37,600 --> 00:34:39,430
If I was a director,

1036
00:34:39,430 --> 00:34:41,970
- I would have hindered the game.
- Right.

1037
00:34:41,970 --> 00:34:43,010
Did you do anything wrong today?

1038
00:34:43,010 --> 00:34:44,810
- I made no mistakes today.
- No mistakes?

1039
00:34:45,240 --> 00:34:46,870
Okay. Am I a director then?

1040
00:34:46,870 --> 00:34:48,740
(Okay. Am I a director then?)

1041
00:34:48,740 --> 00:34:50,970
(What's with this guy?)

1042
00:34:50,970 --> 00:34:52,080
Bye.

1043
00:34:52,080 --> 00:34:53,410
(Their useless conversation
is over.)

1044
00:34:53,410 --> 00:34:55,410
I'll go downstairs.

1045
00:34:55,520 --> 00:34:56,990
(Just then)

1046
00:34:56,990 --> 00:34:58,810
(Kwang Soo looks around.)

1047
00:34:59,950 --> 00:35:03,990
(Making sure no one is around,
Kwang Soo follows Suk Jin.)

1048
00:35:05,450 --> 00:35:06,990
(He stares...)

1049
00:35:06,990 --> 00:35:08,790
(at Suk Jin's back.)

1050
00:35:09,520 --> 00:35:12,100
(Suk Jin looks back.)

1051
00:35:12,700 --> 00:35:14,140
He is acting strange.

1052
00:35:14,330 --> 00:35:16,560
He is suspicious. Okay, I got it.

1053
00:35:16,770 --> 00:35:18,600
- You're being super suspicious.
- What?

1054
00:35:18,600 --> 00:35:20,330
You were watching me
from up there. Okay.

1055
00:35:20,330 --> 00:35:21,470
It was Kwang Soo.

1056
00:35:21,680 --> 00:35:22,950
It's Kwang Soo!

1057
00:35:22,950 --> 00:35:24,270
(He shouts it.)

1058
00:35:24,270 --> 00:35:26,850
Gosh, Kwang Soo was staring
at my name tag from up there.

1059
00:35:26,850 --> 00:35:28,890
(Kwang Soo, whose identity
is unknown, follows Seok JIn.)

1060
00:35:29,740 --> 00:35:31,850
Kwang Soo might think
I'm a director.

1061
00:35:33,060 --> 00:35:35,160
(If Kwang Soo thinks Suk Jin
is a director and targets him...)

1062
00:35:35,160 --> 00:35:36,330
That means...

1063
00:35:36,390 --> 00:35:38,080
Could Kwang Soo
be the national actor?

1064
00:35:39,390 --> 00:35:40,560
Suk Jin.

1065
00:35:40,850 --> 00:35:42,600
Kwang Soo,
are you the national actor?

1066
00:35:44,600 --> 00:35:45,770
You're the national actor,
aren't you?

1067
00:35:45,770 --> 00:35:47,200
(Nodding)

1068
00:35:47,200 --> 00:35:49,540
(Is Kwang Soo really
the national actor?)

1069
00:35:49,540 --> 00:35:50,560
Right?

1070
00:35:50,560 --> 00:35:53,080
(Kwang Soo
was the national actor.)

1071
00:35:53,080 --> 00:35:54,580
I'm just an actor.
I'm nothing special.

1072
00:35:54,910 --> 00:35:56,040
Do a good job.

1073
00:35:56,200 --> 00:35:58,640
- You should eliminate someone.
- I know.

1074
00:35:58,640 --> 00:36:00,140
- You have to.
- Right.

1075
00:36:00,370 --> 00:36:01,950
- I will.
- You have to.

1076
00:36:01,950 --> 00:36:03,450
Who... You have three chances...

1077
00:36:03,890 --> 00:36:06,450
(Just then)

1078
00:36:06,450 --> 00:36:07,810
You have three chances...

1079
00:36:07,810 --> 00:36:09,220
(Suk Jin's name tag
is ripped off.)

1080
00:36:09,220 --> 00:36:10,520
(Kwang Soo eliminates
a director candidate.)

1081
00:36:10,520 --> 00:36:11,830
What did you do?

1082
00:36:11,930 --> 00:36:13,950
Are you a director?
Are you the national actor?

1083
00:36:13,950 --> 00:36:15,270
(What is Suk Jin's identity?)

1084
00:36:15,270 --> 00:36:16,520
(Suk Jin is...)

1085
00:36:16,520 --> 00:36:18,830
(just an actor.)

1086
00:36:18,970 --> 00:36:20,200
Gosh.

1087
00:36:20,890 --> 00:36:22,310
(Kwang Soo got
Suk Jin's identity wrong...)

1088
00:36:22,310 --> 00:36:23,640
(and eliminated Suk Jin.)

1089
00:36:23,640 --> 00:36:26,510
(Then what is Kwang Soo's identity?)

1090
00:36:26,510 --> 00:36:28,950
Actor Ji Suk Jin is out.

1091
00:36:29,950 --> 00:36:32,410
Actor Ji Suk Jin is out.

1092
00:36:32,410 --> 00:36:33,580
Who?

1093
00:36:33,580 --> 00:36:34,910
(The Director A candidates are
Kwang Soo, Se Chan, and Ji Hyo.)

1094
00:36:34,910 --> 00:36:36,290
Suk Jin was an actor?

1095
00:36:36,390 --> 00:36:39,180
Suk Jin? Why was he eliminated?

1096
00:36:39,290 --> 00:36:42,720
Who eliminated him?

1097
00:36:43,580 --> 00:36:44,760
This is crazy.

1098
00:36:44,760 --> 00:36:46,660
(Kwang Soo could be either
a director or the national actor.)

1099
00:36:46,660 --> 00:36:48,790
(He looks for another hint.)

1100
00:36:50,600 --> 00:36:51,870
(Checking)

1101
00:36:51,870 --> 00:36:53,040
What?

1102
00:36:54,330 --> 00:36:57,600
(He finds a mysterious document.)

1103
00:36:59,080 --> 00:37:01,080
(Is there anyone around?)

1104
00:37:02,080 --> 00:37:03,270
What is this?

1105
00:37:03,850 --> 00:37:05,180
I almost missed it.

1106
00:37:05,180 --> 00:37:06,350
- It says, "R".
- What is it?

1107
00:37:06,350 --> 00:37:08,180
(Jong Kook finds a document too.)

1108
00:37:08,180 --> 00:37:09,890
- It's a scenario.
- "A Hint to You."

1109
00:37:09,890 --> 00:37:12,350
(It's titled, "A Hint to You".)

1110
00:37:12,660 --> 00:37:14,760
- Is it a scenario?
- It's a scenario.

1111
00:37:14,760 --> 00:37:16,160
(The document turns out
to be a scenario.)

1112
00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:17,260
Let's check it out.

1113
00:37:18,520 --> 00:37:21,870
"Each member, dressed as his
or her role, walks the red carpet."

1114
00:37:22,370 --> 00:37:23,520
(The producer
explains today's race.)

1115
00:37:23,520 --> 00:37:28,370
(The scenario describes
what they are shooting.)

1116
00:37:28,370 --> 00:37:31,100
(Haha and So Min,
the fake directors,)

1117
00:37:31,100 --> 00:37:34,140
(look happy
after checking their identities.)

1118
00:37:34,740 --> 00:37:35,910
It's Haha.

1119
00:37:35,910 --> 00:37:37,010
(Haha plays a director.)

1120
00:37:37,370 --> 00:37:39,870
(Haha is a fake director too.)

1121
00:37:39,870 --> 00:37:42,310
Look at this. It's Haha.

1122
00:37:42,910 --> 00:37:45,850
Haha thought he was a director.

1123
00:37:45,910 --> 00:37:47,120
I knew it.

1124
00:37:47,120 --> 00:37:49,430
That's why he was acting strange.

1125
00:37:49,430 --> 00:37:50,950
My hunch was right.

1126
00:37:50,950 --> 00:37:52,490
- He thought he was a director.
- Yes.

1127
00:37:52,760 --> 00:37:53,890
Right. Wait.

1128
00:37:54,060 --> 00:37:55,270
It was fake?

1129
00:37:57,520 --> 00:37:59,200
The video hint was fake.

1130
00:38:01,240 --> 00:38:04,560
(The members find
a fake video hint.)

1131
00:38:06,540 --> 00:38:08,970
(Running Man's fan-meet, tears)

1132
00:38:08,970 --> 00:38:11,450
(That means Ji Hyo.)

1133
00:38:11,450 --> 00:38:14,540
(The members believe the fake hint
and suspect regular actors.)

1134
00:38:14,540 --> 00:38:16,580
(Because of the fake hint,)

1135
00:38:16,580 --> 00:38:18,890
(Ji Hyo was suspected
of being a director.)

1136
00:38:18,890 --> 00:38:23,160
(If the hint was fake,
Ji Hyo might not be a director.)

1137
00:38:23,990 --> 00:38:28,330
(Haha found the second video hint.)

1138
00:38:29,200 --> 00:38:30,830
(This person goes by a stage name.)

1139
00:38:31,120 --> 00:38:33,600
(Believing the fake hint,)

1140
00:38:33,600 --> 00:38:36,310
(Haha eliminated Tae Oh.)

1141
00:38:36,310 --> 00:38:38,100
(If the hint was fake,)

1142
00:38:38,100 --> 00:38:40,040
(Yoyomi might not be
the national actor.)

1143
00:38:40,040 --> 00:38:42,080
But the hints from the staff
are true, right?

1144
00:38:43,270 --> 00:38:44,510
They're true, right?

1145
00:38:44,510 --> 00:38:46,810
(Only the written hints are true.)

1146
00:38:46,810 --> 00:38:48,990
"The producer informs
the real directors of hidden rules."

1147
00:38:48,990 --> 00:38:50,080
"The two real directors..."

1148
00:38:50,080 --> 00:38:51,790
"have to eliminate
Haha and So Min..."

1149
00:38:51,790 --> 00:38:54,390
"before eliminating
the national actor."

1150
00:38:56,160 --> 00:38:58,080
(After the two fake directors
are eliminated,)

1151
00:38:58,080 --> 00:39:00,260
(the real directors can
eliminate the national actor.)

1152
00:39:00,560 --> 00:39:03,120
(Oh, I see.)

1153
00:39:03,470 --> 00:39:04,990
We have to go protect Haha.

1154
00:39:06,160 --> 00:39:07,430
Haha is so stupid.

1155
00:39:07,870 --> 00:39:09,600
He makes it so obvious.

1156
00:39:09,600 --> 00:39:11,160
He loves his role.

1157
00:39:12,010 --> 00:39:15,180
Seriously, it's so confusing.

1158
00:39:15,640 --> 00:39:18,040
(Haha runs into someone.)

1159
00:39:18,470 --> 00:39:20,080
- What is it?
- So Min...

1160
00:39:20,720 --> 00:39:22,680
So Min thought she was a director.

1161
00:39:23,140 --> 00:39:24,180
What are you?

1162
00:39:24,810 --> 00:39:25,950
I am nothing.

1163
00:39:25,950 --> 00:39:27,520
You are just the owner
of a barbecue restaurant.

1164
00:39:27,760 --> 00:39:29,450
Don't try to fool me.

1165
00:39:29,450 --> 00:39:30,620
(Haha, Celebrity and owner
of a barbecue restaurant)

1166
00:39:30,620 --> 00:39:32,430
Avoid the others like me.

1167
00:39:33,100 --> 00:39:35,160
- You are Yang Se Hyeong's brother.
- That's right.

1168
00:39:36,220 --> 00:39:37,970
(Meanwhile,
Hyosung is searching for hints.)

1169
00:39:37,970 --> 00:39:39,040
Hold on.

1170
00:39:40,140 --> 00:39:43,470
(She finds the real hint.)

1171
00:39:45,700 --> 00:39:47,640
(Startled)

1172
00:39:47,640 --> 00:39:51,200
(The national actor
is a man in his 30s.)

1173
00:39:51,680 --> 00:39:53,180
(If we combine all the hints
on the national actor...)

1174
00:39:53,180 --> 00:39:54,270
(The national actor
doesn't have 9 in his age.)

1175
00:39:54,270 --> 00:39:55,580
(The national actor
is a man in his 30s...)

1176
00:39:55,580 --> 00:39:57,520
(who doesn't have 9 in his age.)

1177
00:39:57,520 --> 00:39:59,120
(Then the national actor
candidates are...)

1178
00:39:59,290 --> 00:40:01,680
(Se Chan and Kwang Soo.)

1179
00:40:01,680 --> 00:40:02,720
(They are also director candidates.)

1180
00:40:03,020 --> 00:40:04,790
Let's split. Go away.

1181
00:40:04,790 --> 00:40:06,160
I have nowhere to go.

1182
00:40:06,160 --> 00:40:07,260
I am nothing.

1183
00:40:07,260 --> 00:40:09,890
Do you want me to rip off
your name tag?

1184
00:40:10,430 --> 00:40:11,660
(Take this!)

1185
00:40:12,290 --> 00:40:15,160
(He ripped off Haha's name tag!)

1186
00:40:15,160 --> 00:40:17,560
(Se Chan eliminated Haha
in an instant.)

1187
00:40:17,560 --> 00:40:20,810
(Is Se Chan a director?)

1188
00:40:21,430 --> 00:40:23,270
This is a big hint.

1189
00:40:23,270 --> 00:40:24,310
(Is Kwang Soo a director?)

1190
00:40:24,310 --> 00:40:25,540
It will be over once I find him.

1191
00:40:25,540 --> 00:40:27,720
(If one is a director,
the other is the national actor.)

1192
00:40:28,370 --> 00:40:29,810
What was that?

1193
00:40:29,810 --> 00:40:31,810
(Is Se Chan a real director
who eliminated a fake director...)

1194
00:40:31,810 --> 00:40:33,220
(or the national actor
who thought Haha was a director?)

1195
00:40:33,450 --> 00:40:36,950
(Who is a director
and who is the national actor?)

1196
00:40:37,520 --> 00:40:42,100
Haha, an actor who
plays a director is out.

1197
00:40:42,870 --> 00:40:47,240
(Haha, an actor who
plays a director is out.)

1198
00:40:47,240 --> 00:40:49,410
(No way!)

1199
00:40:49,410 --> 00:40:50,510
(She gets goosebumps.)

1200
00:40:50,510 --> 00:40:51,660
I got goosebumps.

1201
00:40:51,660 --> 00:40:53,770
Who ripped off his name tag?

1202
00:40:54,810 --> 00:40:56,910
Did the national actor
think he was a director?

1203
00:40:56,910 --> 00:40:58,580
Did a director think...
Come this way.

1204
00:40:59,220 --> 00:41:01,410
Did a director think
Haha was the national actor?

1205
00:41:01,410 --> 00:41:02,910
(Is it the work of a director
or the national actor?)

1206
00:41:03,890 --> 00:41:05,180
This is bad.

1207
00:41:05,490 --> 00:41:08,890
(Both fake directors are out!)

1208
00:41:09,330 --> 00:41:11,290
(Once the national actor
gets eliminated,)

1209
00:41:11,290 --> 00:41:13,260
(Team Directors will win.)

1210
00:41:14,450 --> 00:41:15,790
That startled me.

1211
00:41:15,970 --> 00:41:19,270
(The two director and national actor
candidates meet.)

1212
00:41:19,270 --> 00:41:20,330
(One is the national actor
and the other is a director.)

1213
00:41:20,330 --> 00:41:21,870
- Did you find anything?
- No.

1214
00:41:23,600 --> 00:41:24,600
Where are you going?

1215
00:41:24,830 --> 00:41:26,140
I am going to look for hints.

1216
00:41:26,700 --> 00:41:28,580
(Staring)

1217
00:41:28,580 --> 00:41:29,640
What?

1218
00:41:29,640 --> 00:41:31,470
- Hold on.
- What?

1219
00:41:31,810 --> 00:41:33,970
Hold on. It seems like...

1220
00:41:33,970 --> 00:41:35,290
- you are trailing me.
- No.

1221
00:41:35,410 --> 00:41:36,410
You...

1222
00:41:36,410 --> 00:41:37,450
(He follows Se Chan.)

1223
00:41:37,450 --> 00:41:38,850
- What?
- You...

1224
00:41:39,020 --> 00:41:40,990
(Se Chan, you...)

1225
00:41:40,990 --> 00:41:42,330
You have two cameras on you.

1226
00:41:42,330 --> 00:41:45,620
(There are two cameras on him.)

1227
00:41:45,790 --> 00:41:48,120
- Kwang Soo, I moved up the ranks.
- Hold on.

1228
00:41:48,120 --> 00:41:50,430
A lot of people got eliminated.

1229
00:41:50,430 --> 00:41:53,490
This is the 1st time in 3 years
for you to have 2 cameras...

1230
00:41:53,490 --> 00:41:54,890
on you.

1231
00:41:54,890 --> 00:41:55,930
Listen.

1232
00:41:55,930 --> 00:41:57,910
A lot of people got eliminated.

1233
00:41:58,430 --> 00:41:59,680
They had a cameraman
who had nothing to shoot.

1234
00:41:59,680 --> 00:42:02,040
Is it for the online video channel
you run with Se Hyeong?

1235
00:42:02,040 --> 00:42:04,350
No, of course not.

1236
00:42:04,350 --> 00:42:06,810
No. We don't use
a professional camera.

1237
00:42:06,810 --> 00:42:07,950
We use a cellphone.

1238
00:42:07,950 --> 00:42:09,140
You used this camera for the video
of you eating pho, right?

1239
00:42:09,140 --> 00:42:11,080
No, I didn't.
It's a misunderstanding.

1240
00:42:11,080 --> 00:42:13,020
I should write this down.

1241
00:42:13,290 --> 00:42:14,950
- What are you writing down?
- "Se Chan has..."

1242
00:42:15,680 --> 00:42:16,760
"two cameras on him."

1243
00:42:16,760 --> 00:42:18,620
It's not like that.
It's a misunderstanding.

1244
00:42:18,620 --> 00:42:21,700
I have an extra camera on me
because many people got eliminated.

1245
00:42:22,720 --> 00:42:24,990
Hyosung, Haha is out.

1246
00:42:25,930 --> 00:42:27,370
What happened?

1247
00:42:27,370 --> 00:42:28,540
(Flustered)

1248
00:42:28,540 --> 00:42:30,160
This is so hard.

1249
00:42:31,140 --> 00:42:32,200
Now,

1250
00:42:32,510 --> 00:42:34,910
I need to find more hints.

1251
00:42:34,910 --> 00:42:37,200
(It seems like
she is doing a poor job of acting.)

1252
00:42:37,200 --> 00:42:38,870
- That was strange.
- What?

1253
00:42:39,640 --> 00:42:40,770
What?

1254
00:42:40,770 --> 00:42:42,680
- Hyosung, that was so strange.
- Was it sloppy?

1255
00:42:42,680 --> 00:42:45,520
Without moving your feet, you said,
"I need to find more hints."

1256
00:42:45,560 --> 00:42:47,450
Hyosung, that was so strange.

1257
00:42:47,850 --> 00:42:50,520
I am just beginning
to figure things out.

1258
00:42:50,760 --> 00:42:52,100
I need to hurry up.

1259
00:42:52,100 --> 00:42:54,450
You aren't the national actor,
are you?

1260
00:42:54,560 --> 00:42:55,790
No, I am not.

1261
00:42:56,890 --> 00:42:59,270
Why do you keep looking
for the national actor?

1262
00:42:59,270 --> 00:43:01,430
(She seems even more suspicious.)

1263
00:43:01,430 --> 00:43:03,870
I need to find the national actor
and protect him.

1264
00:43:03,870 --> 00:43:04,910
(The national actor
is an important figure.)

1265
00:43:04,910 --> 00:43:07,310
(Hyosung is suspicious.)

1266
00:43:08,080 --> 00:43:09,310
Something doesn't seem right.

1267
00:43:09,310 --> 00:43:12,410
(Could Hyosung be a director?)

1268
00:43:13,740 --> 00:43:14,810
(At that moment,)

1269
00:43:14,810 --> 00:43:15,890
Hey.

1270
00:43:15,890 --> 00:43:17,810
(someone shows up.)

1271
00:43:17,810 --> 00:43:19,290
(Jae Suk is happy
to see this person.)

1272
00:43:20,660 --> 00:43:21,720
Hey.

1273
00:43:21,720 --> 00:43:23,490
(Both of them greet
this mysterious person.)

1274
00:43:23,490 --> 00:43:25,490
- Hold on.
- What is going on?

1275
00:43:25,490 --> 00:43:27,120
- What...
- What is going on?

1276
00:43:27,450 --> 00:43:28,490
What is going on?

1277
00:43:28,490 --> 00:43:31,600
(Hyosung joins him.)

1278
00:43:32,040 --> 00:43:35,240
(A 2-on-1 fight suddenly occurs.)

1279
00:43:35,240 --> 00:43:36,560
(Ripping)

1280
00:43:37,060 --> 00:43:39,370
Good job.

1281
00:43:39,370 --> 00:43:40,600
You jerks!

1282
00:43:41,180 --> 00:43:42,700
(Who could be
the mysterious shadow?)

1283
00:43:42,700 --> 00:43:45,100
You jerks! You jerks!

1284
00:43:45,100 --> 00:43:47,520
(Hyosung worked with this person
to eliminate Jae Suk.)

1285
00:43:47,520 --> 00:43:48,520
(What could be her identity?)

1286
00:43:48,520 --> 00:43:51,890
You are the directors who
hold a grudge against the actors...

1287
00:43:51,890 --> 00:43:53,790
for repeatedly turning down
your childish scripts.

1288
00:43:54,290 --> 00:43:55,620
Directors.

1289
00:43:55,760 --> 00:43:58,160
Eliminate the national actor
before the race ends...

1290
00:43:58,160 --> 00:44:01,160
or keep your identities hidden
until the end in order to win.

1291
00:44:01,160 --> 00:44:02,490
The two of you must wait...

1292
00:44:02,490 --> 00:44:04,770
until the fake directors
get eliminated...

1293
00:44:04,770 --> 00:44:07,390
in order to eliminate
the national actor.

1294
00:44:07,390 --> 00:44:09,310
If you eliminate
three actors by mistake,

1295
00:44:09,310 --> 00:44:11,540
you will lose and the race will end.

1296
00:44:12,330 --> 00:44:14,870
(Hyosung, a director, was looking
for the national actor.)

1297
00:44:14,870 --> 00:44:16,600
The national actor.

1298
00:44:17,410 --> 00:44:20,450
(I need to find the national actor.)

1299
00:44:20,620 --> 00:44:23,490
- Actor Jae Suk is out.
- What?

1300
00:44:23,950 --> 00:44:26,180
The race will end in 10 minutes.

1301
00:44:27,080 --> 00:44:28,290
We have 10 minutes.

1302
00:44:28,290 --> 00:44:29,950
We need to find something...

1303
00:44:30,290 --> 00:44:32,120
for the second trial.

1304
00:44:32,120 --> 00:44:36,470
(The members aren't certain about
the 2 directors and national actor.)

1305
00:44:36,470 --> 00:44:37,700
(The two directors must eliminate
the national actor...)

1306
00:44:37,700 --> 00:44:38,870
We don't have much time.

1307
00:44:38,870 --> 00:44:40,640
(and the national actor
must eliminate the 2 directors.)

1308
00:44:40,640 --> 00:44:42,510
Jong Kook. Jong Kook.

1309
00:44:42,930 --> 00:44:44,040
- What?
- Here.

1310
00:44:44,510 --> 00:44:46,370
Let's talk for five minutes.

1311
00:44:46,770 --> 00:44:48,010
- What?
- You can't rip off his name tag.

1312
00:44:48,010 --> 00:44:49,870
- I am not scared.
- Jong Kook, are you scared?

1313
00:44:49,870 --> 00:44:52,180
- Then you don't have to come.
- What? I am not scared.

1314
00:44:52,180 --> 00:44:54,120
- Then come.
- Sure.

1315
00:44:54,240 --> 00:44:55,410
Fine.

1316
00:44:55,640 --> 00:44:57,520
You may not believe me,

1317
00:44:58,310 --> 00:44:59,310
but I am...

1318
00:45:00,520 --> 00:45:02,760
- the national actor.
- Okay.

1319
00:45:02,760 --> 00:45:06,100
I thought you would make a move.

1320
00:45:06,100 --> 00:45:08,760
It's the right time for it.

1321
00:45:08,760 --> 00:45:09,830
Listen.

1322
00:45:09,830 --> 00:45:11,370
- People who are cornered do it.
- I will give you...

1323
00:45:11,890 --> 00:45:14,770
a reason to trust me.
Hyosung told you earlier...

1324
00:45:14,890 --> 00:45:16,910
that Director B is a woman, right?

1325
00:45:17,430 --> 00:45:21,310
(Is Director B a woman?)

1326
00:45:22,370 --> 00:45:26,450
(Jong Kook heard from Hyosung
that Director B is a woman.)

1327
00:45:26,450 --> 00:45:31,350
(The crucial hint
Se Chan claimed to have found)

1328
00:45:31,350 --> 00:45:35,390
(Se Chan's claim)

1329
00:45:35,390 --> 00:45:37,720
(He says Hyosung is Director B
since she is a female guest.)

1330
00:45:37,720 --> 00:45:39,950
Here is the deal.

1331
00:45:39,950 --> 00:45:41,290
If I rip off Hyosung's name tag...

1332
00:45:41,290 --> 00:45:43,430
and she turns out to be Director B,

1333
00:45:43,430 --> 00:45:45,160
please believe me.

1334
00:45:45,600 --> 00:45:47,770
I won't play any tricks.

1335
00:45:47,930 --> 00:45:49,200
- Let's go.
- Okay.

1336
00:45:49,200 --> 00:45:50,660
- Let's cast the die.
- Come on.

1337
00:45:50,660 --> 00:45:52,600
- What a coincidence!
- Jong Kook.

1338
00:45:53,370 --> 00:45:55,870
(Hyosung appears
as soon as they finished talking.)

1339
00:45:55,870 --> 00:45:57,180
Who is it? Oh, here she comes.

1340
00:45:57,180 --> 00:45:58,910
(Isn't the timing too uncanny?)

1341
00:45:58,910 --> 00:46:00,740
- Hold on. Hold on.
- Can you help me?

1342
00:46:00,970 --> 00:46:03,450
Can you hold her for me?

1343
00:46:03,810 --> 00:46:06,890
- The two of them could turn on me.
- It's not like that, Jong Kook.

1344
00:46:06,890 --> 00:46:08,790
- When I grab Hyosung,
- Please.

1345
00:46:08,790 --> 00:46:10,890
you could suddenly rip off
my name tag.

1346
00:46:11,180 --> 00:46:12,700
I can see that happening.

1347
00:46:12,790 --> 00:46:14,390
Who is a director?

1348
00:46:14,990 --> 00:46:16,160
Come here.

1349
00:46:16,160 --> 00:46:17,220
What are you?

1350
00:46:17,470 --> 00:46:18,520
I am an actor.

1351
00:46:18,520 --> 00:46:19,790
(She feigns innocence.)

1352
00:46:19,790 --> 00:46:21,540
(Jong Kook watches.)

1353
00:46:21,970 --> 00:46:24,740
- This is driving me crazy.
- We need to survive from them.

1354
00:46:24,740 --> 00:46:26,510
- What are you?
- I am an actor.

1355
00:46:26,510 --> 00:46:29,540
- You are a director.
- I am an actor.

1356
00:46:29,540 --> 00:46:30,810
You are a director.

1357
00:46:30,810 --> 00:46:32,450
- Are we repeating the same words?
- Yes.

1358
00:46:32,680 --> 00:46:34,850
- I am an actor.
- Hyosung.

1359
00:46:35,470 --> 00:46:39,220
(Se Chan attacks Hyosung.)

1360
00:46:39,890 --> 00:46:41,810
(Jong Kook still doesn't move.)

1361
00:46:42,680 --> 00:46:45,950
(Se Chan tries to prove
that he is the national actor.)

1362
00:46:46,120 --> 00:46:48,520
What is going on?

1363
00:46:48,520 --> 00:46:50,430
(Ripping)

1364
00:46:50,870 --> 00:46:52,270
Are you the national actor?

1365
00:46:52,270 --> 00:46:54,060
(Are you the national actor?)

1366
00:46:54,060 --> 00:46:55,430
(It's time to check
Hyosung's identity.)

1367
00:46:55,430 --> 00:46:56,430
Let's see it.

1368
00:46:56,830 --> 00:46:58,310
- Let's see it.
- Jong Kook.

1369
00:46:58,370 --> 00:47:00,100
Jong Kook, trust me this once.

1370
00:47:00,830 --> 00:47:02,470
(Hyosung is...)

1371
00:47:02,470 --> 00:47:05,200
(one of the directors.)

1372
00:47:05,200 --> 00:47:07,620
(Does that mean
Se Chan is the national actor?)

1373
00:47:07,620 --> 00:47:08,740
You trust me now, right?

1374
00:47:09,120 --> 00:47:10,720
Her tone...

1375
00:47:10,740 --> 00:47:12,080
Hold on. Is he acting?

1376
00:47:12,080 --> 00:47:13,290
For goodness' sake.

1377
00:47:13,290 --> 00:47:14,290
(Hold on. Is he acting?)

1378
00:47:14,290 --> 00:47:16,950
(He can only laugh.)

1379
00:47:17,180 --> 00:47:18,430
"Are you the national actor?"

1380
00:47:18,430 --> 00:47:20,520
Maybe the two of you planned this.

1381
00:47:20,790 --> 00:47:23,120
- Hold on.
- Jong Kook, I am going insane.

1382
00:47:23,120 --> 00:47:24,770
She came out of nowhere.

1383
00:47:24,770 --> 00:47:26,290
After her name tag got ripped off,
she said,

1384
00:47:26,470 --> 00:47:28,640
"Are you the national actor?"

1385
00:47:29,770 --> 00:47:30,770
Hold on.

1386
00:47:30,770 --> 00:47:33,140
Jong Kook,
don't let Hyosung fool you.

1387
00:47:33,140 --> 00:47:34,270
All right.

1388
00:47:34,270 --> 00:47:35,270
(Se Chan eliminated Hyosung
before Jong Kook's eyes.)

1389
00:47:35,270 --> 00:47:38,180
All right. You should go over there.

1390
00:47:38,350 --> 00:47:40,350
Even when I show you proof,

1391
00:47:40,350 --> 00:47:41,580
you think I am acting.

1392
00:47:41,580 --> 00:47:42,580
(The members are still unsure
about everyone's identity.)

1393
00:47:42,580 --> 00:47:44,520
The second trial will begin.

1394
00:47:45,140 --> 00:47:46,660
This is getting interesting.

1395
00:47:47,180 --> 00:47:48,390
(Both of them are the candidates...)

1396
00:47:48,390 --> 00:47:49,990
I have no idea.

1397
00:47:49,990 --> 00:47:51,080
(for a director
and the national actor.)

1398
00:47:51,080 --> 00:47:52,660
- Yes?
- Kwang Soo.

1399
00:47:52,660 --> 00:47:53,720
Yes?

1400
00:47:53,720 --> 00:47:55,390
Did you find anything out?

1401
00:47:55,390 --> 00:47:56,830
I found out many things.

1402
00:47:57,390 --> 00:48:01,240
Just now, I watched...

1403
00:48:02,870 --> 00:48:05,700
a very nicely-planned sketch.

1404
00:48:05,700 --> 00:48:07,410
(It wasn't a sketch.)

1405
00:48:08,510 --> 00:48:11,370
(You are a director.)

1406
00:48:11,370 --> 00:48:12,950
(What he showed is believed
to be part of a sketch.)

1407
00:48:12,950 --> 00:48:14,310
Sit down.

1408
00:48:14,910 --> 00:48:17,310
The second trial will begin now.

1409
00:48:17,310 --> 00:48:19,850
Hyosung, who was a real director,
is out.

1410
00:48:20,020 --> 00:48:21,760
Ji Hyo.

1411
00:48:22,180 --> 00:48:24,080
This is making me talkative.

1412
00:48:24,080 --> 00:48:25,220
Listen to me.

1413
00:48:25,220 --> 00:48:27,330
I am the one
who eliminated Hyosung.

1414
00:48:27,350 --> 00:48:28,560
How did you know?

1415
00:48:28,560 --> 00:48:29,700
I found a hint.

1416
00:48:30,370 --> 00:48:32,330
"Director B is a guest."

1417
00:48:32,330 --> 00:48:36,910
- Did someone see the hint with you?
- Only I saw it.

1418
00:48:36,910 --> 00:48:37,930
(Only I saw it.)

1419
00:48:37,930 --> 00:48:40,080
That's not how you scam people.

1420
00:48:40,080 --> 00:48:42,680
(He suddenly criticizes
Se Chan's scamming skills.)

1421
00:48:42,680 --> 00:48:45,140
(The senior member of Running Man
criticizes Se Chan.)

1422
00:48:45,140 --> 00:48:47,120
I get that you are desperate,

1423
00:48:47,120 --> 00:48:48,520
but that's not how you scam people.

1424
00:48:48,520 --> 00:48:50,240
Jong Kook, tell everyone.

1425
00:48:50,240 --> 00:48:52,760
Since you didn't believe my words...

1426
00:48:52,760 --> 00:48:54,720
I will recount what I saw.

1427
00:48:54,890 --> 00:48:56,490
Listen to me.

1428
00:48:56,490 --> 00:48:58,890
Se Chan claimed
that he was the national actor...

1429
00:48:59,220 --> 00:49:01,950
and asked whether I would trust him
if he eliminated Hyosung...

1430
00:49:02,220 --> 00:49:03,470
before my eyes.

1431
00:49:04,660 --> 00:49:07,990
I said that he was scheming,

1432
00:49:07,990 --> 00:49:09,100
but Se Chan begged me to trust him.

1433
00:49:09,100 --> 00:49:11,870
Then out of the blue,

1434
00:49:12,160 --> 00:49:14,870
Hyosung walked towards us.

1435
00:49:14,870 --> 00:49:16,700
This is driving me crazy.

1436
00:49:17,080 --> 00:49:19,350
- What timing!
- This is driving me crazy.

1437
00:49:19,350 --> 00:49:21,850
Then the two of them
started talking.

1438
00:49:22,490 --> 00:49:24,410
They didn't know the script
very well.

1439
00:49:25,450 --> 00:49:27,350
So they didn't make much sense.

1440
00:49:27,580 --> 00:49:29,020
You thought that was scripted?

1441
00:49:29,020 --> 00:49:30,120
All of a sudden...

1442
00:49:30,120 --> 00:49:32,080
I questioned her one last time.

1443
00:49:32,080 --> 00:49:34,100
- I tested her.
- Then all of a sudden,

1444
00:49:34,100 --> 00:49:35,720
he ripped Hyosung's name tag,

1445
00:49:35,830 --> 00:49:38,220
but as soon as he ripped it,

1446
00:49:38,520 --> 00:49:40,640
she was like,
"What? Are you the national actor?"

1447
00:49:40,640 --> 00:49:42,140
Hey!

1448
00:49:42,140 --> 00:49:45,240
(That was bad acting.)

1449
00:49:45,240 --> 00:49:48,930
(Hyosung's awkward acting
convinced Jong Kook.)

1450
00:49:49,950 --> 00:49:53,350
Jong Kook, if you do this,
you'll hurt many actors.

1451
00:49:53,350 --> 00:49:55,850
No, listen to this. Goodness.

1452
00:49:55,850 --> 00:49:58,910
I watched...

1453
00:49:58,990 --> 00:50:02,350
a very awkward play.

1454
00:50:02,350 --> 00:50:03,350
Not even.

1455
00:50:03,350 --> 00:50:06,060
What if Hyosung wasn't acting?

1456
00:50:06,060 --> 00:50:08,060
She could just be awkward in life.

1457
00:50:08,060 --> 00:50:09,470
"Are you the national actor?"...

1458
00:50:09,470 --> 00:50:11,490
was because she knew
who the director was.

1459
00:50:11,720 --> 00:50:13,490
I have a question.

1460
00:50:14,330 --> 00:50:15,660
You knew...

1461
00:50:16,040 --> 00:50:19,370
Director A is a Running Man member.

1462
00:50:19,930 --> 00:50:20,970
- I know.
- Why didn't you say anything?

1463
00:50:20,970 --> 00:50:24,100
Then why didn't you rip Se Chan's
name tag? From the beginning?

1464
00:50:24,100 --> 00:50:27,140
You told me
that was the first hint you saw.

1465
00:50:27,140 --> 00:50:28,720
Did he say that last?

1466
00:50:29,240 --> 00:50:31,080
Because we deduced that...

1467
00:50:31,080 --> 00:50:33,720
(Because we deduced that...)

1468
00:50:33,720 --> 00:50:36,060
Anyway, when I heard...

1469
00:50:36,060 --> 00:50:37,260
(Kwang Soo can't answer properly.)

1470
00:50:37,260 --> 00:50:39,430
- when I heard...
- "Anyway?"

1471
00:50:39,430 --> 00:50:41,430
(Something's strange.)

1472
00:50:41,430 --> 00:50:43,870
it's somebody in their 30s,

1473
00:50:43,990 --> 00:50:46,640
I know it's not me so that's when
I started looking for Se Chan.

1474
00:50:46,640 --> 00:50:48,600
I don't get it.

1475
00:50:48,740 --> 00:50:51,560
Four of you,
please make your decision.

1476
00:50:51,560 --> 00:50:52,580
Okay.

1477
00:50:53,580 --> 00:50:54,930
Please say it in three.

1478
00:50:54,930 --> 00:50:56,080
- Gosh.
- One,

1479
00:50:56,870 --> 00:50:58,200
(4 actors will choose a director
by majority vote.)

1480
00:50:58,200 --> 00:50:59,220
two,

1481
00:51:00,040 --> 00:51:01,810
(Who do the actors think
a director is?)

1482
00:51:01,810 --> 00:51:04,020
- three.
- Yang Se Chan.

1483
00:51:04,020 --> 00:51:05,310
(Se Chan is their suspect.)

1484
00:51:05,310 --> 00:51:06,680
Yang Se Chan. I don't know.

1485
00:51:07,910 --> 00:51:11,120
It's strange
how he went and came back.

1486
00:51:11,120 --> 00:51:13,060
I know. He kept on leaving.

1487
00:51:13,060 --> 00:51:15,790
Jong Kook, rip my name tag.
I want to see your face.

1488
00:51:15,990 --> 00:51:17,330
Me? All right.

1489
00:51:17,330 --> 00:51:18,870
- Yes.
- I'll do it.

1490
00:51:18,970 --> 00:51:21,370
I opened up about everything.

1491
00:51:21,370 --> 00:51:24,160
- I...
- Okay.

1492
00:51:24,200 --> 00:51:26,600
Look at my face
then look at Kwang Soo's face.

1493
00:51:26,600 --> 00:51:28,600
- I'm going to look at you.
- Okay.

1494
00:51:28,600 --> 00:51:30,140
Fine. Okay.

1495
00:51:30,140 --> 00:51:31,470
- One,
- Let's see.

1496
00:51:31,540 --> 00:51:33,620
(If Se Chan is a director,
Team Actors win.)

1497
00:51:33,620 --> 00:51:34,770
two,

1498
00:51:35,620 --> 00:51:36,890
(What is Se Chan's identity?)

1499
00:51:36,890 --> 00:51:37,890
three.

1500
00:52:51,580 --> 00:52:53,620
(If Se Chan is a director,
Team Actors win.)

1501
00:52:53,620 --> 00:52:55,690
(If he's a national actor,
Team Directors win.)

1502
00:52:55,690 --> 00:52:58,250
(What is Se Chan's identity?)

1503
00:52:58,480 --> 00:53:02,750
(National actor)

1504
00:53:04,920 --> 00:53:08,190
(Se Chan was a national actor!)

1505
00:53:10,230 --> 00:53:11,730
Hello.

1506
00:53:11,730 --> 00:53:12,790
(Before the start of the show)

1507
00:53:12,790 --> 00:53:16,730
What kind of informer role
do you need from me?

1508
00:53:16,940 --> 00:53:18,480
- What am I today?
- You are...

1509
00:53:18,480 --> 00:53:21,130
a national actor every Korean loves.

1510
00:53:21,130 --> 00:53:22,400
(You are a national actor
every Korean loves.)

1511
00:53:22,400 --> 00:53:24,250
Are you lying already?

1512
00:53:24,250 --> 00:53:26,580
Okay.

1513
00:53:27,210 --> 00:53:28,880
(I witnessed it!)

1514
00:53:29,980 --> 00:53:31,810
(Haha and Tae Oh were together,)

1515
00:53:31,810 --> 00:53:33,420
(but Tae Oh was eliminated.)

1516
00:53:33,880 --> 00:53:36,960
(Se Chan heard
Jae Suk's statement.)

1517
00:53:39,130 --> 00:53:40,920
(Haha is a director.)

1518
00:53:42,100 --> 00:53:45,190
(Se Chan was certain Haha was
a director and eliminated him.)

1519
00:53:45,190 --> 00:53:48,190
(He was the national actor
who was looking for the directors.)

1520
00:53:50,940 --> 00:53:52,830
(At that moment!)

1521
00:53:53,670 --> 00:53:55,810
(Yes!)

1522
00:53:56,400 --> 00:53:58,580
(Is he the remaining director?)

1523
00:53:58,710 --> 00:54:01,690
National Actor Yang Se Chan
has been eliminated.

1524
00:54:01,980 --> 00:54:03,310
- Really?
- Yes!

1525
00:54:03,310 --> 00:54:05,120
(The remaining director
was Kwang Soo!)

1526
00:54:06,520 --> 00:54:08,750
(I think it's Suk Jin.)

1527
00:54:08,750 --> 00:54:10,130
(The fake director)

1528
00:54:11,080 --> 00:54:15,600
(He eliminated Suk Jin,
but he was an actor.)

1529
00:54:16,400 --> 00:54:17,730
You idiot.

1530
00:54:18,060 --> 00:54:22,230
(An actor who plays a director,
Haha, is out.)

1531
00:54:22,230 --> 00:54:23,230
How did that happen?

1532
00:54:23,230 --> 00:54:26,500
(Actor Haha was out, so he could
eliminate the national actor now.)

1533
00:54:28,130 --> 00:54:34,750
(He eliminated Jae Suk who was
closing in on him.)

1534
00:54:36,440 --> 00:54:39,580
The winning team of Ggannes
Film Festival: The Uninvited One...

1535
00:54:39,580 --> 00:54:40,850
is Team Directors.

1536
00:54:40,850 --> 00:54:42,750
(Winners of Ggannes Film Festival:
The Uninvited One: Team Directors)

1537
00:54:43,020 --> 00:54:45,460
I was a director all day today.

1538
00:54:45,900 --> 00:54:47,600
Team Actors lost the race.

1539
00:54:47,600 --> 00:54:50,230
Since there are only
two water cannons,

1540
00:54:50,230 --> 00:54:52,830
National Actor Se Chan
has to take one.

1541
00:54:52,830 --> 00:54:55,900
You can choose another person
to join you.

1542
00:54:55,900 --> 00:54:58,880
It was my mistake, so I'll go.
Let's go together.

1543
00:54:58,940 --> 00:55:01,310
(He feels pressured.)

1544
00:55:01,310 --> 00:55:03,150
- Hold on.
- He feels bad.

1545
00:55:03,480 --> 00:55:05,850
For Jong Kook, the timing was...

1546
00:55:05,850 --> 00:55:08,020
- It was my fault.
- perfect.

1547
00:55:08,020 --> 00:55:11,710
The person who will stand under
the water cannon with me...

1548
00:55:12,210 --> 00:55:14,520
(He chooses the person who'll
receive the penalty with him.)

1549
00:55:14,520 --> 00:55:15,690
is Kyung-hwan.

1550
00:55:15,690 --> 00:55:16,920
(It's Kyung-hwan.)

1551
00:55:16,920 --> 00:55:18,560
Are you crazy? What was that for?

1552
00:55:19,190 --> 00:55:20,190
What?

1553
00:55:20,650 --> 00:55:21,960
What was that for?

1554
00:55:21,960 --> 00:55:24,400
Kyung-hwan,
you need the camera on you.

1555
00:55:24,400 --> 00:55:26,190
So you were nothing today,
but you acted that way?

1556
00:55:26,190 --> 00:55:28,540
I know! You deserve
the water cannon.

1557
00:55:29,100 --> 00:55:30,230
This is nuts.

1558
00:55:31,230 --> 00:55:34,230
Why is Kyung-hwan standing there?

1559
00:55:34,230 --> 00:55:35,500
(He's getting ready
for the water cannon.)

1560
00:55:35,500 --> 00:55:36,940
Kyung-hwan.

1561
00:55:37,310 --> 00:55:41,120
You showed your presence
in unique ways today.

1562
00:55:41,120 --> 00:55:42,580
We never had a guest like him.

1563
00:55:42,580 --> 00:55:46,880
Unfortunately, I joined late,
so I wasn't too funny.

1564
00:55:47,120 --> 00:55:49,250
As a penalty,

1565
00:55:49,250 --> 00:55:50,980
- That's not true.
- I get the water bucket.

1566
00:55:50,980 --> 00:55:52,500
- That's why he's here.
- Then...

1567
00:55:52,500 --> 00:55:53,630
Let's go!

1568
00:55:55,420 --> 00:55:59,540
(Pouring)

1569
00:55:59,540 --> 00:56:00,690
That's cold.

1570
00:56:00,830 --> 00:56:02,770
(That was a good one.)

1571
00:56:03,670 --> 00:56:05,810
(We would like to thank Kyung-hwan,
Hyosung, Tae Oh, and Yoyomi.)

1572
00:56:05,810 --> 00:56:09,770
- That was cold water.
- It's cold.

1573
00:56:09,770 --> 00:56:11,210
(That was a refreshing penalty
in the frigid winter.)

1574
00:56:12,170 --> 00:56:15,420
(Day in Yeouido when cold weather
warning was in effect)

1575
00:56:15,420 --> 00:56:18,020
It finally feels like winter.

1576
00:56:18,020 --> 00:56:20,250
We'll start separately today.

1577
00:56:20,250 --> 00:56:21,830
- Are we starting?
- Yes.

1578
00:56:22,250 --> 00:56:24,630
All eight members will
start separately.

1579
00:56:24,630 --> 00:56:26,000
This is the mission.

1580
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:27,130
(All 8 members started
at different locations.)

1581
00:56:27,830 --> 00:56:30,130
"Form a team
and come to the opening location."

1582
00:56:30,130 --> 00:56:32,870
"4 guests today..."
There are 4 guests?

1583
00:56:32,870 --> 00:56:35,130
"Four guests today are captains."

1584
00:56:35,130 --> 00:56:38,000
"They'll recruit two people
from Running Man."

1585
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:42,000
"Once you form a team of three,
you will obtain the address."

1586
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:44,350
"The first 2 teams will
receive benefits." Oh, my.

1587
00:56:44,350 --> 00:56:45,750
(Form a team of 3 to obtain
the address. 2 teams get benefits.)

1588
00:56:45,750 --> 00:56:47,040
So we don't know
who the captains are?

1589
00:56:47,040 --> 00:56:49,620
Who's the other member besides me?

1590
00:56:49,620 --> 00:56:50,620
Do you not tell us that either?

1591
00:56:50,620 --> 00:56:53,120
Who are the guests? Goodness.

1592
00:56:54,620 --> 00:56:55,690
Am I the only one who's cold?

1593
00:56:55,690 --> 00:56:58,500
It's so cold. This is no joke.
It's freezing.

1594
00:56:59,250 --> 00:57:02,000
(Born to be actor, Ahn Jae Hong)

1595
00:57:03,100 --> 00:57:05,940
(The lovable actress, Kang Sora,
Rising-star actress, Jeon Yeo Been)

1596
00:57:06,690 --> 00:57:08,960
(Kim Sung Oh, an actor
with a distinctive character)

1597
00:57:09,270 --> 00:57:10,560
(Casts of "Secret Zoo"...)

1598
00:57:10,560 --> 00:57:12,480
(are on Running Man!)

1599
00:57:13,580 --> 00:57:17,770
(Ahn Jae Hong captured
the movie scene with his warmth.)

1600
00:57:18,750 --> 00:57:22,940
(Kang Sora always shows
new charms.)

1601
00:57:23,620 --> 00:57:27,020
(Kim Sung Oh's face and acting are
always memorable.)

1602
00:57:27,790 --> 00:57:30,960
(Jeon Yeo Been has a bright future
with her characteristic acting.)

1603
00:57:32,100 --> 00:57:34,830
Welcome to Running Man.

1604
00:57:34,900 --> 00:57:37,370
We invited you separately
before the opening segment...

1605
00:57:37,370 --> 00:57:40,790
because of a special mission
since this is your first time.

1606
00:57:40,790 --> 00:57:44,000
Sung Oh, Jae Hong,
Sora, and Yeo Been,

1607
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:46,400
you are captains of each team.

1608
00:57:46,400 --> 00:57:48,100
(We're captains?)

1609
00:57:48,100 --> 00:57:52,350
You need to pick two people
from the Running Man cast,

1610
00:57:52,350 --> 00:57:55,620
pick them up,
and get to the opening location.

1611
00:57:55,620 --> 00:57:56,980
Pick them up?

1612
00:57:57,980 --> 00:58:01,290
Please pick two members each.

1613
00:58:01,520 --> 00:58:02,880
- Let's go.
- Is it a lottery?

1614
00:58:02,880 --> 00:58:04,630
- Do we pick 2 each?
- Yes, 2 each.

1615
00:58:05,500 --> 00:58:07,250
Pick two.

1616
00:58:07,690 --> 00:58:09,420
I'm getting nervous for some reason.

1617
00:58:10,670 --> 00:58:13,460
(They carefully check
who their teammates are.)

1618
00:58:13,460 --> 00:58:14,460
Why?

1619
00:58:14,460 --> 00:58:16,900
I picked somebody reliable.

1620
00:58:17,330 --> 00:58:20,600
(Sung Oh's first pick is Jong Kook!)

1621
00:58:21,900 --> 00:58:23,900
(The four teams)

1622
00:58:23,900 --> 00:58:26,040
Let's start the race now.

1623
00:58:26,040 --> 00:58:27,710
(They pick their teams
and start the mission.)

1624
00:58:28,420 --> 00:58:31,480
Please give me Ji Hyo's number.

1625
00:58:31,480 --> 00:58:33,060
- What?
- Please give me Ji Hyo's number.

1626
00:58:33,060 --> 00:58:35,020
- Who do you need to find?
- Ji Hyo.

1627
00:58:35,020 --> 00:58:36,130
- Do you have her number?
- She's here.

1628
00:58:36,130 --> 00:58:38,900
But I don't know where she is.

1629
00:58:38,900 --> 00:58:40,960
- Her car's white.
- Really?

1630
00:58:40,960 --> 00:58:42,400
All these cars are white.

1631
00:58:42,400 --> 00:58:44,100
Go to the parking lot.

1632
00:58:44,100 --> 00:58:46,500
Really? Okay.

1633
00:58:46,600 --> 00:58:49,540
Se Chan.

1634
00:58:50,900 --> 00:58:53,270
Let me call So Min.

1635
00:58:53,270 --> 00:58:54,710
(He shot a commercial with her.)

1636
00:58:58,500 --> 00:59:01,120
What? It's Jae Hong.

1637
00:59:01,120 --> 00:59:04,540
Jae Hong is calling me. Jae Hong.

1638
00:59:04,920 --> 00:59:07,750
(Why is she so happy it's Jae Hong?)

1639
00:59:08,380 --> 00:59:09,690
Date for a day.

1640
00:59:09,690 --> 00:59:13,290
(Jae Hong is...)

1641
00:59:13,290 --> 00:59:15,290
(her ideal type.)

1642
00:59:15,630 --> 00:59:18,400
(Her ideal type is
finally on Running Man!)

1643
00:59:19,600 --> 00:59:22,770
(She is excited
to receive a call from him.)

1644
00:59:22,940 --> 00:59:24,560
- Hello.
- Hello.

1645
00:59:25,880 --> 00:59:27,400
Are you visiting the show today?

1646
00:59:27,400 --> 00:59:28,480
(She uses her cute tone.)

1647
00:59:28,480 --> 00:59:29,500
Hello, So Min.

1648
00:59:29,500 --> 00:59:30,670
(Hello, So Min.)

1649
00:59:30,670 --> 00:59:32,940
What is going on?
Are you coming? Are you a guest?

1650
00:59:33,440 --> 00:59:34,480
Yes.

1651
00:59:34,580 --> 00:59:35,980
My goodness.

1652
00:59:36,710 --> 00:59:39,060
Are you on my team?

1653
00:59:39,380 --> 00:59:41,480
Yes. Where are you? We need to meet.

1654
00:59:42,060 --> 00:59:43,790
I am at the Han River parking lot.

1655
00:59:43,790 --> 00:59:45,650
Who else is on our team?

1656
00:59:45,900 --> 00:59:48,020
Yang Se Chan.

1657
00:59:49,020 --> 00:59:50,230
(He tries to get
Se Chan's phone number.)

1658
00:59:50,230 --> 00:59:51,920
Are you near Yeouido Park?
It's not far from here.

1659
00:59:52,400 --> 00:59:54,370
- I will give you his number.
- Okay.

1660
00:59:54,560 --> 00:59:56,040
I will text you.

1661
00:59:56,960 --> 00:59:59,330
(He adapted to Running Man
as soon as he arrived.)

1662
00:59:59,330 --> 01:00:00,810
Hello.

1663
01:00:01,440 --> 01:00:02,600
Who is this?

1664
01:00:02,710 --> 01:00:04,440
Hello, Se Chan.

1665
01:00:04,440 --> 01:00:05,880
I am Ahn Jae Hong.

1666
01:00:07,380 --> 01:00:08,580
Stop lying. Who are you?

1667
01:00:09,980 --> 01:00:11,540
I am not lying.

1668
01:00:12,120 --> 01:00:14,250
- Is it really you?
- Yes, it is.

1669
01:00:14,250 --> 01:00:15,790
My goodness, hello.

1670
01:00:15,790 --> 01:00:17,230
Hello. Have you been well?

1671
01:00:17,250 --> 01:00:19,190
You and I are on the same team.
You are cold, right?

1672
01:00:19,250 --> 01:00:21,790
You don't sound like
you are in a hurry.

1673
01:00:22,060 --> 01:00:23,520
It's as if you aren't
a fellow team member.

1674
01:00:24,060 --> 01:00:25,960
(Distrust is prevalent
on this show.)

1675
01:00:25,960 --> 01:00:27,500
- You should be in a hurry.
- I am remaining calm...

1676
01:00:27,900 --> 01:00:29,500
in order to be dependable.

1677
01:00:29,710 --> 01:00:31,540
I will put my trust in you
and wait here.

1678
01:00:32,170 --> 01:00:34,100
Okay. Don't tell So Min.

1679
01:00:34,100 --> 01:00:35,880
We are on the same team, Se Chan.

1680
01:00:35,900 --> 01:00:37,850
- You have to trust me.
- I trust you.

1681
01:00:39,020 --> 01:00:40,440
(Sora got Kwang Soo's number
from a friend.)

1682
01:00:40,440 --> 01:00:41,670
Hello.

1683
01:00:42,310 --> 01:00:44,790
- My name is Kang Sora.
- What?

1684
01:00:44,790 --> 01:00:47,790
I became a captain.

1685
01:00:48,880 --> 01:00:51,690
- Where are you?
- You are Kang Sora.

1686
01:00:51,790 --> 01:00:53,690
I need to go to you.

1687
01:00:54,600 --> 01:00:56,420
I am at Exit Five
of Yeouido Park Station.

1688
01:00:56,420 --> 01:00:57,830
Exit Five of Yeouido Park Station?

1689
01:00:57,830 --> 01:00:59,870
Whether you are the captain or not,
I will get on the van.

1690
01:00:59,960 --> 01:01:01,400
Okay.

1691
01:01:01,960 --> 01:01:04,500
- If this is a lie,
- Okay.

1692
01:01:04,500 --> 01:01:06,230
I will be brokenhearted.

1693
01:01:06,230 --> 01:01:08,000
It's real.

1694
01:01:08,270 --> 01:01:12,040
I need to pick up
you and Jae Suk...

1695
01:01:12,540 --> 01:01:13,880
and go to the opening.

1696
01:01:14,770 --> 01:01:15,940
I will send you his number.

1697
01:01:16,190 --> 01:01:17,310
- Okay.
- Okay.

1698
01:01:18,920 --> 01:01:19,980
This is fun.

1699
01:01:20,080 --> 01:01:21,350
I didn't get any sleep yesterday,

1700
01:01:21,460 --> 01:01:22,980
but it's fun being here.

1701
01:01:22,980 --> 01:01:24,130
(Sung Oh, the variety show newbie,
is excited.)

1702
01:01:25,190 --> 01:01:26,600
(To get his team members'
phone numbers,)

1703
01:01:26,600 --> 01:01:28,250
(he calls his acquaintance, Ji Hyo.)

1704
01:01:28,250 --> 01:01:31,500
The number you have dialed
is unavailable.

1705
01:01:31,500 --> 01:01:32,600
Is she not picking up on purpose?

1706
01:01:32,600 --> 01:01:33,940
(No way.)

1707
01:01:33,940 --> 01:01:35,940
I feel like
people are scheming already.

1708
01:01:37,230 --> 01:01:38,400
Then...

1709
01:01:38,400 --> 01:01:39,670
(He becomes nervous.)

1710
01:01:40,730 --> 01:01:41,940
(He has no choice
but to call Jae Hong.)

1711
01:01:41,940 --> 01:01:43,080
Jae Hong.

1712
01:01:43,080 --> 01:01:44,100
Did you meet your team members?

1713
01:01:44,480 --> 01:01:47,440
I am almost done now.

1714
01:01:47,580 --> 01:01:51,790
You told Jae Suk
that he is on your team.

1715
01:01:51,790 --> 01:01:52,980
(What?)

1716
01:01:52,980 --> 01:01:54,380
- Me?
- Yes.

1717
01:01:54,650 --> 01:01:55,850
That's what he said.

1718
01:01:55,850 --> 01:01:57,290
(He throws another lie.)

1719
01:01:57,290 --> 01:01:58,690
I can't do this.

1720
01:01:58,690 --> 01:02:00,000
Everyone lies.

1721
01:02:00,920 --> 01:02:02,630
I don't know.
I haven't found anyone yet.

1722
01:02:02,690 --> 01:02:04,830
I don't think
I will be able to star on the show.

1723
01:02:04,830 --> 01:02:06,130
The shoot will end
before I find anyone.

1724
01:02:06,130 --> 01:02:08,440
Please give me So Min's number.

1725
01:02:08,440 --> 01:02:11,040
I need to meet my team members.
I just got on the van.

1726
01:02:11,100 --> 01:02:12,270
So Min.

1727
01:02:12,270 --> 01:02:13,310
(Hanging up)

1728
01:02:13,600 --> 01:02:14,730
So Min.

1729
01:02:16,080 --> 01:02:17,900
This is unbelievable.
Is this how it usually goes?

1730
01:02:17,900 --> 01:02:18,920
(It's a culture shock.)

1731
01:02:19,420 --> 01:02:20,880
He just hung up!

1732
01:02:22,620 --> 01:02:24,920
(Rummaging)

1733
01:02:25,460 --> 01:02:26,880
Entertainment...

1734
01:02:27,380 --> 01:02:28,690
YES IM...

1735
01:02:28,690 --> 01:02:33,400
(He searches the web and calls
the team members' agencies.)

1736
01:02:35,190 --> 01:02:37,370
- It's a weekday, right?
- Yes, it is.

1737
01:02:38,020 --> 01:02:39,500
Why is no one picking up?

1738
01:02:40,370 --> 01:02:43,440
I called So Min's agency,
but no one is picking up. It's 10am.

1739
01:02:43,440 --> 01:02:45,210
(He is the 1st guest to call
the members' agencies.)

1740
01:02:46,630 --> 01:02:48,100
(While Sung Oh searches
for their phone numbers,)

1741
01:02:48,100 --> 01:02:49,580
(Jong Kook waits for the captain.)

1742
01:02:49,580 --> 01:02:51,750
It's so strange
that no one is calling me.

1743
01:02:51,750 --> 01:02:52,880
(Why is no one calling me?)

1744
01:02:53,770 --> 01:02:55,850
Who on earth is the captain?

1745
01:02:56,710 --> 01:02:58,120
For goodness' sake.

1746
01:02:58,880 --> 01:03:00,560
I am beginning to get angry.

1747
01:03:01,350 --> 01:03:03,350
Everyone got a call except for me.

1748
01:03:04,230 --> 01:03:05,560
Unbelievable.

1749
01:03:05,560 --> 01:03:07,750
(Will Sung Oh's team be able
to meet?)

1750
01:03:08,870 --> 01:03:10,370
(Jae Suk calls someone.)

1751
01:03:10,370 --> 01:03:11,500
She picked up right away.

1752
01:03:12,230 --> 01:03:13,370
Hello.

1753
01:03:13,460 --> 01:03:16,500
<i>The flowers sway</i>

1754
01:03:16,900 --> 01:03:20,270
(So Min sings
Jae Hong's theme song in a drama.)

1755
01:03:20,270 --> 01:03:21,270
So Min.

1756
01:03:21,270 --> 01:03:24,270
You aren't in a drama with Jae Hong.

1757
01:03:25,000 --> 01:03:27,250
Jae Suk, there is
an unwanted member between us.

1758
01:03:27,350 --> 01:03:29,210
- Who is it?
- Se Chan.

1759
01:03:31,350 --> 01:03:33,250
(Her former love interest became
someone she wants to eliminate.)

1760
01:03:33,250 --> 01:03:35,480
This is interesting.

1761
01:03:36,150 --> 01:03:38,790
Sorry, Jae Suk. I have to go.

1762
01:03:39,750 --> 01:03:40,900
Where are you going?

1763
01:03:41,730 --> 01:03:43,290
For goodness' sake.

1764
01:03:43,290 --> 01:03:45,060
(She left to find love.)

1765
01:03:45,060 --> 01:03:46,870
So Min is so annoying.

1766
01:03:47,500 --> 01:03:48,670
So Min, where are you?

1767
01:03:48,790 --> 01:03:50,210
I am...

1768
01:03:50,600 --> 01:03:52,900
in front of the convenience store.
Are you here?

1769
01:03:52,900 --> 01:03:54,500
- I am nearly there.
- Okay.

1770
01:03:54,500 --> 01:03:56,710
I will go to greet you.

1771
01:03:56,880 --> 01:03:58,270
Are you nearly here?
Oh, that must be your van.

1772
01:03:58,380 --> 01:03:59,620
Jae Hong!

1773
01:03:59,620 --> 01:04:01,710
Oh, that must be your van. Jae Hong!

1774
01:04:01,770 --> 01:04:03,350
I am here. Hurry up.

1775
01:04:03,790 --> 01:04:05,040
Jae Hong.

1776
01:04:06,480 --> 01:04:08,690
I will go to you. Wait.

1777
01:04:08,710 --> 01:04:09,880
I will go to you.

1778
01:04:10,020 --> 01:04:11,580
Jae Hong, I will go to you.

1779
01:04:11,650 --> 01:04:12,790
Have you been well?

1780
01:04:15,000 --> 01:04:16,330
It's good to see you.

1781
01:04:16,330 --> 01:04:17,560
- Have you been well?
- Yes.

1782
01:04:17,670 --> 01:04:19,330
How did this happen?

1783
01:04:19,330 --> 01:04:20,730
Seriously.

1784
01:04:21,460 --> 01:04:23,210
Thank goodness you knew my number.

1785
01:04:23,210 --> 01:04:24,400
- If the guest...
- Seriously.

1786
01:04:24,830 --> 01:04:26,580
- didn't know my number...
- It's cold, right?

1787
01:04:27,080 --> 01:04:28,230
Let's go.

1788
01:04:28,230 --> 01:04:29,380
Do you want to go in first?

1789
01:04:30,440 --> 01:04:31,600
Have you been well?

1790
01:04:31,600 --> 01:04:33,420
Yes. My goodness.

1791
01:04:33,480 --> 01:04:36,480
<i>The flowers sway</i>

1792
01:04:37,150 --> 01:04:40,580
<i>And I smell your shampoo</i>

1793
01:04:41,290 --> 01:04:42,790
- My goodness.
- It's good to see you here.

1794
01:04:42,790 --> 01:04:43,790
Seriously.

1795
01:04:43,790 --> 01:04:45,600
All the guests had a lottery...

1796
01:04:45,690 --> 01:04:47,830
- and I got you and Se Chan.
- He is useless.

1797
01:04:48,350 --> 01:04:50,330
We need to go right away...

1798
01:04:50,330 --> 01:04:52,730
- to get a priority.
- Let's go.

1799
01:04:52,730 --> 01:04:54,060
That fool...

1800
01:04:54,130 --> 01:04:55,960
is going to Kwang Soo.

1801
01:04:55,960 --> 01:04:57,370
He doesn't know he is on our team.

1802
01:04:58,060 --> 01:04:59,230
- Really?
- Yes.

1803
01:05:00,100 --> 01:05:01,380
Let me call him.

1804
01:05:01,710 --> 01:05:03,000
Who is Kwang Soo's captain?

1805
01:05:03,100 --> 01:05:04,170
Hello.

1806
01:05:04,170 --> 01:05:05,270
- Kwang Soo.
- Hey.

1807
01:05:05,650 --> 01:05:07,770
You and I are on the same team.

1808
01:05:09,520 --> 01:05:11,150
(Hanging up)

1809
01:05:12,480 --> 01:05:14,020
(The line is dead.)

1810
01:05:16,080 --> 01:05:17,330
He has no trust in you.

1811
01:05:18,330 --> 01:05:19,750
She keeps getting worse.

1812
01:05:19,750 --> 01:05:20,960
It might as well be a condition.

1813
01:05:22,870 --> 01:05:24,000
Hello.

1814
01:05:24,020 --> 01:05:27,270
Sora, I will send you
Se Chan's number.

1815
01:05:27,270 --> 01:05:30,040
Please tell Se Chan
that he is on our team.

1816
01:05:30,460 --> 01:05:31,770
Okay.

1817
01:05:32,440 --> 01:05:33,810
Did you understand my words?

1818
01:05:33,900 --> 01:05:35,080
Yes.

1819
01:05:35,900 --> 01:05:38,170
- Okay.
- Should I pick up Se Chan as well?

1820
01:05:38,540 --> 01:05:41,750
We will lie to Se Chan
about being on our team...

1821
01:05:41,750 --> 01:05:44,440
so that his team will arrive late.

1822
01:05:44,440 --> 01:05:46,020
Jae Suk and I are
in your team, right?

1823
01:05:46,060 --> 01:05:47,210
That's right.

1824
01:05:47,580 --> 01:05:48,620
Okay.

1825
01:05:48,620 --> 01:05:50,150
(Did she really understand?)

1826
01:05:51,330 --> 01:05:53,290
I will be on my phone all day long.

1827
01:05:54,020 --> 01:05:55,500
Hold on.

1828
01:05:55,500 --> 01:05:56,600
What is this?

1829
01:05:57,170 --> 01:05:59,500
Hello.

1830
01:06:00,400 --> 01:06:03,130
Gosh, everyone is playing tricks.

1831
01:06:03,370 --> 01:06:06,540
All the captains are tricksters.
Who is this?

1832
01:06:06,900 --> 01:06:08,940
My name is Kang Sora.

1833
01:06:09,500 --> 01:06:11,310
I don't know
if I should believe you.

1834
01:06:11,310 --> 01:06:12,920
I got your phone number only now.

1835
01:06:12,920 --> 01:06:14,850
The line was busy too.

1836
01:06:14,920 --> 01:06:16,980
I am sorry, but it sounds like
you are acting.

1837
01:06:17,210 --> 01:06:19,420
You are trying to trick me.

1838
01:06:20,350 --> 01:06:21,710
Are you really a captain?

1839
01:06:21,710 --> 01:06:22,750
Yes.

1840
01:06:22,920 --> 01:06:26,420
- Okay. Then I will be on my way.
- Okay.

1841
01:06:26,420 --> 01:06:27,690
- Call me.
- Okay.

1842
01:06:27,790 --> 01:06:28,830
Please wait a bit longer.

1843
01:06:28,960 --> 01:06:30,830
- Okay.
- Okay.

1844
01:06:31,290 --> 01:06:33,060
The captains are dirty.

1845
01:06:33,060 --> 01:06:34,290
For goodness' sake.

1846
01:06:34,900 --> 01:06:36,230
Yeouido Park?

1847
01:06:36,230 --> 01:06:38,310
I will run to Yeouido Park.

1848
01:06:38,370 --> 01:06:39,380
The statue...

1849
01:06:39,380 --> 01:06:40,500
Yeo Been!

1850
01:06:41,440 --> 01:06:42,480
Where is she?

1851
01:06:42,480 --> 01:06:43,650
Yeo Been, I am here.

1852
01:06:44,100 --> 01:06:46,170
(The first meeting
between a captain and a team member)

1853
01:06:46,170 --> 01:06:47,580
(Suddenly, Haha enters.)

1854
01:06:47,580 --> 01:06:48,750
My goodness.

1855
01:06:48,750 --> 01:06:50,580
(An uninvited guest appears.)

1856
01:06:50,580 --> 01:06:51,790
Thank goodness.

1857
01:06:52,210 --> 01:06:53,980
- Thank goodness.
- Thank goodness.

1858
01:06:53,980 --> 01:06:55,120
No.

1859
01:06:55,120 --> 01:06:56,330
- Let's go.
- You're not on my team.

1860
01:06:56,330 --> 01:06:57,730
Why not?

1861
01:06:58,290 --> 01:06:59,750
(Aren't you my captain?)

1862
01:06:59,750 --> 01:07:01,500
- You're not on my team.
- Why not?

1863
01:07:01,650 --> 01:07:03,870
- Let's go.
- Let's hurry up.

1864
01:07:05,630 --> 01:07:06,960
Haha, I am sorry.

1865
01:07:08,330 --> 01:07:10,130
Sir, please get out.

1866
01:07:10,630 --> 01:07:11,730
If you get out...

1867
01:07:12,170 --> 01:07:14,270
(He tries to steal the van.)

1868
01:07:14,270 --> 01:07:16,000
I will drive.

1869
01:07:16,000 --> 01:07:17,270
(He is the politest car thief.)

1870
01:07:17,380 --> 01:07:18,540
Stay in the van.

1871
01:07:18,750 --> 01:07:20,420
- No.
- I will drive you there.

1872
01:07:20,920 --> 01:07:22,350
- Sir.
- No, no.

1873
01:07:22,350 --> 01:07:23,710
- No.
- No, no.

1874
01:07:23,810 --> 01:07:25,650
- Sir.
- No, no.

1875
01:07:25,810 --> 01:07:27,620
- No.
- No, no.

1876
01:07:27,880 --> 01:07:29,350
- All right. Let's go.
- No.

1877
01:07:29,480 --> 01:07:31,020
I will drive you there.

1878
01:07:31,020 --> 01:07:33,250
- What are you doing?
- I will drive you there.

1879
01:07:33,350 --> 01:07:35,960
- Go away!
- Yeo Been, it's nice to meet you.

1880
01:07:36,190 --> 01:07:38,230
You keep threatening me,

1881
01:07:38,230 --> 01:07:40,770
- but I can do the same.
- Okay.

1882
01:07:40,770 --> 01:07:42,830
If you keep threatening me,

1883
01:07:42,900 --> 01:07:44,730
- I will drive to Sokcho.
- We didn't...

1884
01:07:44,730 --> 01:07:46,270
- We understand.
- Okay?

1885
01:07:46,270 --> 01:07:48,210
- We didn't say anything.
- Do you want to eat mulhoe...

1886
01:07:48,210 --> 01:07:49,600
- at Sokcho?
- No, no.

1887
01:07:49,600 --> 01:07:52,000
You don't need to drive to Sokcho.

1888
01:07:52,000 --> 01:07:53,920
You know that I am a man of action.

1889
01:07:54,270 --> 01:07:55,540
(Meanwhile, Kwang Soo is waiting
for Se Chan.)

1890
01:07:55,540 --> 01:07:56,650
Hey.

1891
01:07:56,650 --> 01:07:57,710
Where are you?

1892
01:07:58,080 --> 01:07:59,190
Kwang Soo,

1893
01:07:59,310 --> 01:08:00,980
you know the opening location
of "2 Days 1 Night", right?

1894
01:08:01,420 --> 01:08:04,060
Do you think it would be a good idea
for us to go there?

1895
01:08:04,980 --> 01:08:06,290
Don't you know the opening location
of "2 Days 1 Night"?

1896
01:08:06,830 --> 01:08:08,400
I know, but...

1897
01:08:08,690 --> 01:08:10,330
How do you know it?

1898
01:08:11,190 --> 01:08:13,730
- What?
- Do you watch "2 Days 1 Night"?

1899
01:08:15,130 --> 01:08:16,330
It's not like that.

1900
01:08:16,330 --> 01:08:17,830
- A long time ago...
- I don't know where it is.

1901
01:08:17,830 --> 01:08:19,900
My head is filled
with the locations of Running Man.

1902
01:08:19,980 --> 01:08:21,980
I have an incoming call
from the captain.

1903
01:08:22,230 --> 01:08:24,150
- Hurry up and come here.
- Okay.

1904
01:08:25,770 --> 01:08:28,150
(When will Sora get here?)

1905
01:08:29,150 --> 01:08:30,190
Hello.

1906
01:08:30,190 --> 01:08:31,520
Where are you?

1907
01:08:31,540 --> 01:08:34,690
I am trying
to pick up Jae Suk first.

1908
01:08:34,690 --> 01:08:36,960
But the Han River Park is
so big that...

1909
01:08:37,150 --> 01:08:39,850
What do you see?

1910
01:08:40,000 --> 01:08:41,920
I am at Yeouido Park,
not the Han River Park.

1911
01:08:42,130 --> 01:08:43,870
- Yeouido Park?
- Yes.

1912
01:08:44,100 --> 01:08:48,690
I specifically asked you
if you understood what I had said.

1913
01:08:48,690 --> 01:08:51,010
- That's right.
- You keep saying that.

1914
01:08:51,010 --> 01:08:53,140
But I never mentioned
the Han River Park.

1915
01:08:53,140 --> 01:08:54,210
(I told you that
I'm at Yeouido Park so many times.)

1916
01:08:54,300 --> 01:08:56,800
- I will meet up with Se Chan.
- Okay.

1917
01:08:56,900 --> 01:08:57,970
What? Is that Ji Hyo?

1918
01:08:58,900 --> 01:09:00,080
What? Is that Ji Hyo?

1919
01:09:00,080 --> 01:09:01,680
(Yeo Been and Ji Hyo run
toward his direction.)

1920
01:09:02,840 --> 01:09:04,440
(They ignore Kwang Soo.)

1921
01:09:04,590 --> 01:09:07,090
- Yeo Been!
- Kwang Soo, hello.

1922
01:09:07,090 --> 01:09:08,220
Hey, you...

1923
01:09:08,720 --> 01:09:10,520
How could you go
without stopping to say hello?

1924
01:09:11,260 --> 01:09:12,330
What is going on?

1925
01:09:12,330 --> 01:09:13,720
(They run past Kwang Soo
and get on his van.)

1926
01:09:13,720 --> 01:09:15,430
- Let's go.
- Hurry up and get in.

1927
01:09:15,690 --> 01:09:16,760
Hurry up and get in.

1928
01:09:16,760 --> 01:09:19,760
(Captain Yeo Been and Ji Hyo
get into Kwang Soo's van.)

1929
01:09:20,560 --> 01:09:22,060
So this is how it works.

1930
01:09:22,800 --> 01:09:23,970
(Kwang Soo's van door closes.)

1931
01:09:23,970 --> 01:09:26,180
- Lock the door.
- Close the door. Hurry up.

1932
01:09:26,180 --> 01:09:27,470
- What's going on?
- Close the door.

1933
01:09:27,600 --> 01:09:29,840
- What's wrong?
- Close the door.

1934
01:09:29,840 --> 01:09:30,840
What?

1935
01:09:31,580 --> 01:09:33,550
Why did they get in my van?

1936
01:09:34,140 --> 01:09:36,510
Please take us to exit nine.

1937
01:09:36,680 --> 01:09:37,840
Kwang Soo.

1938
01:09:37,840 --> 01:09:38,920
(Se Chan came for Kwang Soo.)

1939
01:09:38,920 --> 01:09:40,920
- Hey.
- I'll pick up Jae Suk first.

1940
01:09:40,920 --> 01:09:42,480
Lower your voice.
I'm talking to Se Chan.

1941
01:09:42,650 --> 01:09:43,930
I just...

1942
01:09:43,930 --> 01:09:45,330
(Se Chan is confused
because Jae Hong called him.)

1943
01:09:45,330 --> 01:09:48,020
- Ahn Jae Hong.
- He called me too.

1944
01:09:48,050 --> 01:09:50,020
Hang up.

1945
01:09:50,020 --> 01:09:51,590
Se Chan, he's trying to trick you.

1946
01:09:52,690 --> 01:09:54,340
- Is it Sora?
- Hang up. Yes.

1947
01:09:55,090 --> 01:09:57,600
- But this...
- You got your van stolen.

1948
01:09:58,060 --> 01:10:01,140
If you don't meet your captain
and fall behind,

1949
01:10:01,230 --> 01:10:02,970
you have to walk
to the opening location.

1950
01:10:02,970 --> 01:10:04,770
- Why doesn't he have a van?
- Just now,

1951
01:10:04,900 --> 01:10:08,220
Ji Hyo and Yeo Been took his van.

1952
01:10:08,440 --> 01:10:09,550
They have our van?

1953
01:10:09,550 --> 01:10:11,750
Shouldn't I report this
to the police?

1954
01:10:12,010 --> 01:10:13,510
That's not fair.

1955
01:10:13,650 --> 01:10:14,790
- Hold on.
- Who is it?

1956
01:10:14,890 --> 01:10:16,150
Hello. Se Chan.

1957
01:10:16,790 --> 01:10:18,790
(Sora met up with Jae Suk.
She's calling Kwang Soo now.)

1958
01:10:18,790 --> 01:10:20,220
- Hello?
- Where are you now?

1959
01:10:20,220 --> 01:10:22,130
I'm leaving now.

1960
01:10:22,130 --> 01:10:23,970
You said we're on the same team
as Se Chan.

1961
01:10:24,130 --> 01:10:26,170
- What?
- Is it the three of us?

1962
01:10:26,170 --> 01:10:28,140
No, I picked up Jae Suk.

1963
01:10:28,140 --> 01:10:29,370
(She's clueless.)

1964
01:10:30,510 --> 01:10:32,680
(But Se Chan...)

1965
01:10:32,680 --> 01:10:34,010
Are we on Jae Suk's team?

1966
01:10:34,300 --> 01:10:35,640
Who's on our side?

1967
01:10:35,840 --> 01:10:40,180
I told you multiple times.

1968
01:10:40,180 --> 01:10:41,680
(He's flustered.)

1969
01:10:41,680 --> 01:10:42,720
Hello?

1970
01:10:42,720 --> 01:10:44,250
(You have to trick Se Chan.)

1971
01:10:44,250 --> 01:10:45,550
Hello?

1972
01:10:46,890 --> 01:10:50,350
I just... This is driving me nuts.

1973
01:10:50,850 --> 01:10:52,960
Excuse me, Sora.

1974
01:10:53,050 --> 01:10:55,430
I'm Se Chan.
I thought we were on the same team.

1975
01:10:55,430 --> 01:10:56,930
Forget it.

1976
01:10:56,930 --> 01:10:58,130
What did you do?

1977
01:10:58,130 --> 01:11:00,890
Forget it. We're going to go first.

1978
01:11:00,890 --> 01:11:02,710
Put Kwang Soo on the phone.

1979
01:11:02,710 --> 01:11:04,060
Sora.

1980
01:11:04,210 --> 01:11:08,930
How many times did I ask you
if you understood me?

1981
01:11:09,440 --> 01:11:11,440
(What?)

1982
01:11:12,750 --> 01:11:13,920
(While Se Chan wasn't paying
attention, he stole the phone.)

1983
01:11:13,920 --> 01:11:15,940
Give it back.

1984
01:11:16,640 --> 01:11:18,890
I have to get going. Don't go.

1985
01:11:19,010 --> 01:11:20,510
I stole Se Chan's phone.

1986
01:11:20,650 --> 01:11:22,150
I'm running away.

1987
01:11:22,150 --> 01:11:23,650
Give me my phone back!

1988
01:11:23,650 --> 01:11:25,390
I can't go without it.

1989
01:11:25,720 --> 01:11:27,130
I'm sorry, Se Chan!

1990
01:11:27,130 --> 01:11:28,300
(He's a nice thief.)

1991
01:11:28,300 --> 01:11:29,330
I'm sorry!

1992
01:11:30,000 --> 01:11:32,930
We can't even be aired. We're going
back and forth in front of KBS.

1993
01:11:32,930 --> 01:11:34,690
We won't be aired.

1994
01:11:34,690 --> 01:11:36,140
(Se Chan lost his phone
and his team.)

1995
01:11:36,140 --> 01:11:37,640
Goodness, Kwang Soo.

1996
01:11:38,170 --> 01:11:40,730
Where is Se Chan?

1997
01:11:40,730 --> 01:11:42,080
We have to pick him up, right?

1998
01:11:42,180 --> 01:11:45,250
- We just have to pick him up.
- Then we're done.

1999
01:11:45,580 --> 01:11:47,720
Gosh, you brought luck.

2000
01:11:47,720 --> 01:11:49,550
- I know.
- Things are going smoothly.

2001
01:11:49,550 --> 01:11:51,420
(Sorry, So Min.)

2002
01:11:52,440 --> 01:11:54,480
(Jae Hong is calling Se Chan.)

2003
01:11:54,480 --> 01:11:55,850
Where are you? Hurry up.

2004
01:11:55,850 --> 01:11:58,590
- We're in front of the banner.
- Hangang Park.

2005
01:11:58,590 --> 01:12:00,220
- I'm at Hangang Park.
- Hurry up. Run.

2006
01:12:00,460 --> 01:12:01,630
Hangang Park.

2007
01:12:01,630 --> 01:12:03,090
- Run.
- Where is he?

2008
01:12:03,090 --> 01:12:05,670
- Hangang Park.
- Everybody met up.

2009
01:12:05,670 --> 01:12:07,040
We have to hurry.

2010
01:12:07,670 --> 01:12:09,060
I'm at Hangang Park.

2011
01:12:09,060 --> 01:12:10,560
Why aren't you talking?

2012
01:12:10,760 --> 01:12:12,470
Hangang Park.

2013
01:12:12,470 --> 01:12:14,180
Why are you at Hangang Park?

2014
01:12:14,640 --> 01:12:16,550
(Se Chan was walking.)

2015
01:12:16,550 --> 01:12:17,840
I think that's our van.

2016
01:12:18,010 --> 01:12:19,380
I think that's our van.

2017
01:12:20,420 --> 01:12:22,920
- Come here.
- Why aren't you talking?

2018
01:12:22,920 --> 01:12:24,590
(She was talking
to the fake Se Chan.)

2019
01:12:25,290 --> 01:12:26,810
Why are you at Hangang Park?

2020
01:12:26,810 --> 01:12:30,550
(The real Se Chan is here.)

2021
01:12:30,850 --> 01:12:32,130
I'll just get on.

2022
01:12:32,960 --> 01:12:34,590
Se Chan!

2023
01:12:34,590 --> 01:12:35,720
Who is it?

2024
01:12:36,670 --> 01:12:37,830
Jae Suk!

2025
01:12:37,830 --> 01:12:39,970
(Devil's advocate)

2026
01:12:41,690 --> 01:12:42,760
Jae Suk!

2027
01:12:42,760 --> 01:12:43,840
Hurry!

2028
01:12:44,010 --> 01:12:45,060
What's going on?

2029
01:12:45,060 --> 01:12:46,430
Where are you going?

2030
01:12:46,430 --> 01:12:48,040
Kwang Soo stole...

2031
01:12:48,300 --> 01:12:50,600
my phone, so I fell behind.

2032
01:12:51,180 --> 01:12:52,340
- Where?
- Hurry. This way.

2033
01:12:52,340 --> 01:12:53,470
- Am I on your team?
- Yes.

2034
01:12:53,470 --> 01:12:54,920
- Really?
- We were looking for you.

2035
01:12:54,920 --> 01:12:56,840
- Really? Are you sure?
- Hurry.

2036
01:12:56,840 --> 01:12:58,050
Hurry up.

2037
01:12:58,050 --> 01:12:59,980
You're not supposed to be there.

2038
01:13:00,550 --> 01:13:03,350
We're by the main building of KBS.

2039
01:13:03,350 --> 01:13:05,520
Come to
the National Assembly Building.

2040
01:13:06,090 --> 01:13:08,130
Come to
the National Assembly Building.

2041
01:13:08,800 --> 01:13:10,130
This is Kwang Soo, right?

2042
01:13:12,000 --> 01:13:13,370
You're Kwang Soo, right?

2043
01:13:15,090 --> 01:13:16,800
Where's Se Chan? Hurry up.

2044
01:13:17,010 --> 01:13:19,540
We were looking for you.
You don't have a phone.

2045
01:13:19,540 --> 01:13:21,710
- Kwang Soo took mine.
- What a huge relief.

2046
01:13:22,230 --> 01:13:24,080
- Where are we going?
- Come this way. Get on.

2047
01:13:24,080 --> 01:13:26,220
- Who is it?
- Why don't you have a phone?

2048
01:13:26,220 --> 01:13:27,970
- Were you serious?
- Yes.

2049
01:13:28,380 --> 01:13:29,680
Get in the back.

2050
01:13:29,810 --> 01:13:31,120
Goodness.

2051
01:13:31,120 --> 01:13:32,250
We looked for a long time.

2052
01:13:32,250 --> 01:13:34,390
- Sora, you were serious. Hi.
- Hurry up.

2053
01:13:34,650 --> 01:13:36,550
- What was that?
- Kwang Soo...

2054
01:13:36,980 --> 01:13:38,390
stole my phone.

2055
01:13:38,390 --> 01:13:40,150
What's wrong with him?

2056
01:13:40,150 --> 01:13:41,800
- Are we really on the same team?
- Yes.

2057
01:13:41,800 --> 01:13:42,800
Really?

2058
01:13:42,800 --> 01:13:45,090
You didn't have a phone,
so we looked for a long time.

2059
01:13:45,090 --> 01:13:46,340
Jae Suk, I...

2060
01:13:46,540 --> 01:13:47,670
Now,

2061
01:13:48,560 --> 01:13:50,430
we have a team, so let's go.

2062
01:13:50,840 --> 01:13:52,060
Are we good then?

2063
01:13:52,060 --> 01:13:54,510
- Yes, it's you, me, and Sora.
- Gosh, Kwang Soo.

2064
01:13:54,510 --> 01:13:58,640
He didn't trust Sora,
so he said he's on her team.

2065
01:13:58,640 --> 01:14:01,380
He snatched my phone
and went to meet up with her.

2066
01:14:02,620 --> 01:14:03,750
Where are you?

2067
01:14:04,890 --> 01:14:06,180
I'm...

2068
01:14:06,760 --> 01:14:09,150
at Yeouido Park by exit six.

2069
01:14:11,520 --> 01:14:14,260
It's not there.
We're by the main building of KBS.

2070
01:14:14,390 --> 01:14:16,000
We're by the main building.
Come this way.

2071
01:14:16,670 --> 01:14:17,690
Hurry up.

2072
01:14:17,690 --> 01:14:19,020
How did you get your phone stolen?

2073
01:14:19,020 --> 01:14:21,060
He was talking to you.

2074
01:14:21,190 --> 01:14:22,730
I had it, but he snatched it.

2075
01:14:22,730 --> 01:14:24,340
- Hold on, Jae Suk.
- What?

2076
01:14:24,600 --> 01:14:27,540
Sora,
we have our team. Look.

2077
01:14:27,540 --> 01:14:29,230
We have to go to
our destination then.

2078
01:14:29,230 --> 01:14:31,010
We have to take your phone.

2079
01:14:31,010 --> 01:14:32,750
We have to communicate through this.

2080
01:14:32,750 --> 01:14:34,840
Why do we need to?
There are three of us.

2081
01:14:34,840 --> 01:14:36,550
- That's true, but...
- We have to meet again.

2082
01:14:36,550 --> 01:14:38,920
Hold on, Jae Suk.

2083
01:14:38,920 --> 01:14:41,890
I'm not on this team, right?

2084
01:14:41,890 --> 01:14:43,960
(Se Chan is smarter than
they think.)

2085
01:14:43,960 --> 01:14:46,500
(She blocks his way.)

2086
01:14:47,630 --> 01:14:49,150
Move. Move!

2087
01:14:49,150 --> 01:14:51,000
You bad people! Move.

2088
01:14:51,000 --> 01:14:52,800
Sora, gosh.

2089
01:14:52,800 --> 01:14:54,930
You too. Kwang Soo.

2090
01:14:54,930 --> 01:14:56,430
Move.

2091
01:14:56,540 --> 01:14:57,970
Stay in our van.

2092
01:14:57,970 --> 01:14:59,880
(He loses time but escapes.)

2093
01:14:59,880 --> 01:15:01,430
(Grabbing)

2094
01:15:02,470 --> 01:15:03,510
Get out.

2095
01:15:03,510 --> 01:15:05,510
(They almost tricked him.)

2096
01:15:05,510 --> 01:15:07,220
- My time!
- Se Chan.

2097
01:15:07,220 --> 01:15:08,720
Gosh, Kwang Soo.

2098
01:15:08,720 --> 01:15:09,940
My gosh.

2099
01:15:10,750 --> 01:15:12,140
(We should have held
onto him longer.)

2100
01:15:12,140 --> 01:15:13,260
We should have gone.

2101
01:15:13,350 --> 01:15:14,890
Where are you?

2102
01:15:14,980 --> 01:15:16,890
- I'm...
- Who is it?

2103
01:15:16,890 --> 01:15:18,350
Se Chan.

2104
01:15:18,350 --> 01:15:19,590
- Hey!
- I'm...

2105
01:15:19,590 --> 01:15:22,090
(They see Suk Jin passing by.)

2106
01:15:22,460 --> 01:15:23,760
Se Chan.

2107
01:15:23,760 --> 01:15:25,190
I'll get him.

2108
01:15:27,430 --> 01:15:28,760
Suk Jin!

2109
01:15:28,760 --> 01:15:30,210
(Crying)

2110
01:15:30,560 --> 01:15:32,100
- Who is it?
- Hurry up.

2111
01:15:32,640 --> 01:15:33,880
Where are you?

2112
01:15:33,880 --> 01:15:35,210
I was waiting for you. Hurry up.

2113
01:15:35,210 --> 01:15:36,270
- Is it you?
- Yes.

2114
01:15:36,270 --> 01:15:37,300
No, I'm on Jae Hong's team.

2115
01:15:37,300 --> 01:15:39,380
You're not on his team.

2116
01:15:39,380 --> 01:15:41,080
- Really?
- We kept on looking for you.

2117
01:15:41,080 --> 01:15:42,140
Sora?

2118
01:15:42,140 --> 01:15:43,720
Yes, get on.

2119
01:15:43,720 --> 01:15:45,810
- Jae Hong said...
- Get in the back. Let's go.

2120
01:15:45,810 --> 01:15:47,180
Jae Hong said...

2121
01:15:47,180 --> 01:15:49,220
- You're not on his team.
- I have to meet him.

2122
01:15:49,220 --> 01:15:51,350
You're not on Jae Hong's team.

2123
01:15:51,350 --> 01:15:53,590
It's Sora, me, and you.
What are you talking about?

2124
01:15:53,590 --> 01:15:55,020
- Really?
- Yes.

2125
01:15:55,020 --> 01:15:57,500
Why didn't you call me then?

2126
01:15:57,500 --> 01:15:58,760
This is so chaotic.

2127
01:15:58,760 --> 01:16:00,300
I don't think I'm on this team.

2128
01:16:00,300 --> 01:16:01,590
You are.

2129
01:16:01,590 --> 01:16:02,930
- I don't think I'm on this team.
- Let's get going.

2130
01:16:02,930 --> 01:16:04,730
- I'm not on this team.
- Let's go.

2131
01:16:04,730 --> 01:16:06,210
Put your seat belt on.

2132
01:16:06,210 --> 01:16:10,600
Why are you not happy to see him?
He's on our team.

2133
01:16:10,600 --> 01:16:11,680
(I can't do this.)

2134
01:16:11,680 --> 01:16:13,050
- Excuse me.
- Sora.

2135
01:16:13,050 --> 01:16:15,080
- I'm not.
- He's on our team.

2136
01:16:15,080 --> 01:16:17,140
He's on our team.
Why aren't you happy to see him?

2137
01:16:17,340 --> 01:16:19,390
- I'm not on your team.
- I was startled.

2138
01:16:19,390 --> 01:16:21,050
We're on the same team.
Why aren't you happy to see him?

2139
01:16:21,050 --> 01:16:22,120
Move.

2140
01:16:22,790 --> 01:16:25,150
I can tell from her face!

2141
01:16:25,150 --> 01:16:26,300
Move!

2142
01:16:26,300 --> 01:16:28,500
- It's obvious.
- Goodness.

2143
01:16:29,430 --> 01:16:31,470
Sora can't lie.

2144
01:16:31,470 --> 01:16:33,470
Move. I'm not on this team.

2145
01:16:33,590 --> 01:16:34,890
Hey.

2146
01:16:35,060 --> 01:16:36,540
Sora.

2147
01:16:36,540 --> 01:16:38,900
Why are you doing this?

2148
01:16:39,340 --> 01:16:40,710
Why is everybody...

2149
01:16:40,710 --> 01:16:41,710
(Se Chan is still by KBS.)

2150
01:16:41,710 --> 01:16:44,470
Why is everybody trying to get me?

2151
01:16:44,840 --> 01:16:47,180
Here. Se Chan! Run!

2152
01:16:47,180 --> 01:16:48,640
It's here!

2153
01:16:49,180 --> 01:16:50,440
Se Chan!

2154
01:16:50,440 --> 01:16:52,050
Yang Se Chan!

2155
01:16:52,050 --> 01:16:53,810
I'm at Yeouido Park by exit six.

2156
01:16:53,810 --> 01:16:55,310
Run.

2157
01:16:55,650 --> 01:16:56,930
Where are you?

2158
01:16:56,930 --> 01:16:58,930
- He got his phone stolen?
- Yes.

2159
01:16:58,930 --> 01:17:00,260
He got it stolen.

2160
01:17:00,260 --> 01:17:02,830
- Why did you get your phone stolen?
- We waited for you. Let's go.

2161
01:17:02,830 --> 01:17:05,060
- Let's get going.
- Jae Suk held me.

2162
01:17:05,170 --> 01:17:07,140
- I got everything stolen.
- Hurry up.

2163
01:17:07,140 --> 01:17:08,730
- Hurry. We're ready.
- Hurry up.

2164
01:17:08,730 --> 01:17:10,260
- There was bloodshed.
- Hurry up.

2165
01:17:10,260 --> 01:17:11,670
Get in.

2166
01:17:12,010 --> 01:17:13,300
Hurry.

2167
01:17:13,580 --> 01:17:16,230
We have to get going. We might lose.

2168
01:17:16,230 --> 01:17:17,680
(If this was the team, they would
get told the destination.)

2169
01:17:17,680 --> 01:17:19,470
Where do we need to go?

2170
01:17:20,120 --> 01:17:22,640
Should we pick up Haha too?

2171
01:17:22,640 --> 01:17:24,590
Let's go somewhere else.

2172
01:17:24,980 --> 01:17:27,260
I want to say hi to him.

2173
01:17:27,920 --> 01:17:29,960
We're not a team then.

2174
01:17:29,960 --> 01:17:31,130
- What? I'm not on this team?
- Are we not?

2175
01:17:31,130 --> 01:17:34,090
Jae Hong, if I'm not on this team,
I'd be very disappointed.

2176
01:17:34,090 --> 01:17:36,370
Jae Hong, I have a reason now.

2177
01:17:36,370 --> 01:17:37,830
I can beat somebody up now.

2178
01:17:37,830 --> 01:17:39,970
I have a reason to beat somebody up.

2179
01:17:39,970 --> 01:17:41,390
I'm going to beat somebody up.

2180
01:17:41,390 --> 01:17:42,840
- You have to trust me.
- Who?

2181
01:17:43,140 --> 01:17:44,230
- You?
- Me.

2182
01:17:44,230 --> 01:17:46,210
Really? Is Haha on our team?

2183
01:17:47,880 --> 01:17:49,800
(Meanwhile, Sung Oh is...)

2184
01:17:51,470 --> 01:17:53,580
We'll be done
by the time I find them.

2185
01:17:57,750 --> 01:17:59,790
Should we go eat?

2186
01:18:00,420 --> 01:18:04,020
(He couldn't reach anybody,
so he had almost given up.)

2187
01:18:04,330 --> 01:18:05,980
There he is.

2188
01:18:07,130 --> 01:18:08,960
- We're coming.
- Jae Hong.

2189
01:18:09,300 --> 01:18:12,000
- Yes? Where are you?
- Brace yourself.

2190
01:18:12,130 --> 01:18:13,870
- I will.
- Can you stop here?

2191
01:18:13,870 --> 01:18:15,190
(He finally got a chance to talk
after an hour.)

2192
01:18:15,190 --> 01:18:17,400
- Goodness.
- Where?

2193
01:18:17,400 --> 01:18:18,900
Hello.

2194
01:18:18,900 --> 01:18:20,710
Hold on. What's going on?

2195
01:18:20,710 --> 01:18:21,930
- Hello.
- Hold on.

2196
01:18:21,930 --> 01:18:24,010
- I have to find people.
- What happened?

2197
01:18:24,010 --> 01:18:26,010
I couldn't find you.

2198
01:18:26,010 --> 01:18:28,250
Who's on your team?

2199
01:18:28,250 --> 01:18:29,580
Your team.

2200
01:18:29,580 --> 01:18:31,290
You two.

2201
01:18:31,390 --> 01:18:33,260
- Are you sure?
- Don't do that.

2202
01:18:33,260 --> 01:18:35,920
- Are you serious?
- This is driving me nuts.

2203
01:18:35,920 --> 01:18:37,850
I don't think I can do this.

2204
01:18:37,850 --> 01:18:38,930
(He's exhausted.)

2205
01:18:39,220 --> 01:18:41,500
I woke up at 5 a.m.

2206
01:18:41,800 --> 01:18:44,000
Everybody's lying.

2207
01:18:44,370 --> 01:18:46,930
- Is this real TV?
- No, so...

2208
01:18:46,930 --> 01:18:49,500
- You have to be somewhat truthful.
- But then...

2209
01:18:49,500 --> 01:18:51,870
Nobody trusts me
or answers my calls.

2210
01:18:51,870 --> 01:18:53,270
- What's this now?
- Fine.

2211
01:18:53,270 --> 01:18:56,270
We sometimes...

2212
01:18:56,270 --> 01:18:58,400
don't trust the guests,

2213
01:18:58,400 --> 01:19:00,340
but I can't trust you even more.

2214
01:19:00,340 --> 01:19:01,440
(He always plays the villain.)

2215
01:19:01,440 --> 01:19:03,390
I'm leaving.

2216
01:19:03,810 --> 01:19:06,680
- This doesn't make sense.
- That's not why. Listen.

2217
01:19:06,680 --> 01:19:08,760
- Wait. He's calling again.
- I thought it was going to be easy.

2218
01:19:09,050 --> 01:19:11,850
Look. I looked you up
on the internet.

2219
01:19:11,850 --> 01:19:13,590
You can't find my number online.

2220
01:19:13,590 --> 01:19:15,630
- I was looking up your agency.
- My agency.

2221
01:19:15,630 --> 01:19:17,800
I called your agency,
but why aren't they picking up?

2222
01:19:18,260 --> 01:19:21,760
- You called my agency.
- It's 10 a.m. on a weekday.

2223
01:19:21,760 --> 01:19:24,040
- Why aren't they working?
- You called my agency?

2224
01:19:24,040 --> 01:19:25,600
- Convince me.
- Hold on.

2225
01:19:25,600 --> 01:19:27,510
- I have Jae Hong on the phone.
- Listen.

2226
01:19:27,510 --> 01:19:29,510
- I figured it out too.
- Talk to him.

2227
01:19:29,510 --> 01:19:31,550
- Jae Hong.
- Yes. Where are you?

2228
01:19:31,550 --> 01:19:33,720
Hey, let's not do this.

2229
01:19:34,680 --> 01:19:37,680
- No one believes me. Seriously.
- Wait. Hey.

2230
01:19:37,680 --> 01:19:39,810
Hey, let's not do this.

2231
01:19:39,810 --> 01:19:42,920
My head hurts too.
It's too early in the morning.

2232
01:19:42,920 --> 01:19:45,460
I admit that I do lie a lot.

2233
01:19:45,460 --> 01:19:48,650
But no one will believe me.
Nothing will come of this.

2234
01:19:48,650 --> 01:19:51,890
- Let me.
- I don't care if I place last.

2235
01:19:51,890 --> 01:19:54,230
- Hello.
- Jae Hong.

2236
01:19:54,230 --> 01:19:55,260
- Hello.
- Hello.

2237
01:19:55,260 --> 01:19:58,170
- That's Sung Oh.
- Hello, I'm the chief producer.

2238
01:19:58,170 --> 01:19:59,710
(Hello, I'm the chief producer.)

2239
01:19:59,710 --> 01:20:01,340
- Who?
- It's Se Chan.

2240
01:20:01,340 --> 01:20:03,510
You scumbag. That's enough!

2241
01:20:03,510 --> 01:20:05,180
(Haha gives Se Chan
New Year's words of blessings.)

2242
01:20:05,180 --> 01:20:07,550
Don't curse at me.
I'm frustrated too.

2243
01:20:07,550 --> 01:20:09,310
Where are you? Let's meet.

2244
01:20:10,050 --> 01:20:11,550
He's trying to buy time.

2245
01:20:11,550 --> 01:20:13,720
Right.
Jae Hong is trying to buy time.

2246
01:20:13,720 --> 01:20:15,720
- That's that.
- Who are on your team?

2247
01:20:15,720 --> 01:20:18,050
You always play this,
so there's no reason to go all out.

2248
01:20:18,050 --> 01:20:19,830
But why is everyone lying?

2249
01:20:19,830 --> 01:20:20,890
- It's not that.
- What?

2250
01:20:20,890 --> 01:20:22,000
Let's get in.

2251
01:20:22,850 --> 01:20:26,690
I mean,
you should have called me sooner.

2252
01:20:26,800 --> 01:20:29,500
We were wondering
why our captain wasn't calling us.

2253
01:20:30,260 --> 01:20:33,100
All right.
The three of you are here,

2254
01:20:33,140 --> 01:20:35,540
- but I cannot give you the address.
- Come on. Unbelievable.

2255
01:20:35,540 --> 01:20:37,440
- I can't believe him.
- Why are you doing this?

2256
01:20:37,440 --> 01:20:40,010
(His anger has dissipated now.)

2257
01:20:40,010 --> 01:20:41,270
(As they figure out that he lied,
he becomes an innocent lamb.)

2258
01:20:41,270 --> 01:20:42,810
When I spotted you two...

2259
01:20:42,810 --> 01:20:44,680
- He's unbelievable.
- Listen.

2260
01:20:45,050 --> 01:20:46,220
Both of you...

2261
01:20:46,720 --> 01:20:47,720
- This...
- Wait.

2262
01:20:47,720 --> 01:20:49,050
- This is...
- I don't get it.

2263
01:20:49,050 --> 01:20:50,630
Who's on your team?

2264
01:20:50,630 --> 01:20:51,720
- I'll be honest.
- Who is it?

2265
01:20:51,720 --> 01:20:53,350
- Sung Oh.
- I'll really be honest.

2266
01:20:53,350 --> 01:20:54,690
Turn off the camera.

2267
01:20:54,690 --> 01:20:56,300
- I'll really be honest.
- We can't turn that off.

2268
01:20:56,300 --> 01:20:58,590
You and I are on the same team.

2269
01:20:58,590 --> 01:21:00,500
And we need to find So Min.

2270
01:21:00,500 --> 01:21:02,040
- Really? Are you sure?
- Yes.

2271
01:21:02,040 --> 01:21:04,010
- Yes.
- Are you sure?

2272
01:21:04,010 --> 01:21:05,900
Hold on. Wait!

2273
01:21:05,900 --> 01:21:07,430
- Hold on a second.
- Stay here.

2274
01:21:07,430 --> 01:21:09,600
Okay. You might run away. Wait.

2275
01:21:09,600 --> 01:21:12,180
We need to keep a member
that's not on our team.

2276
01:21:12,680 --> 01:21:14,880
- What are you doing?
- I get it.

2277
01:21:14,880 --> 01:21:16,620
- What is this?
- Don't move.

2278
01:21:16,620 --> 01:21:17,890
That's right.

2279
01:21:17,890 --> 01:21:18,920
Jae Suk!

2280
01:21:18,920 --> 01:21:20,220
(Meanwhile, other teams...)

2281
01:21:20,220 --> 01:21:22,460
- Come quickly.
- Hurry.

2282
01:21:22,810 --> 01:21:24,650
- Let's go.
- Gosh, Se Chan.

2283
01:21:25,460 --> 01:21:26,830
I have Se Chan's phone.

2284
01:21:26,830 --> 01:21:28,590
- Nice to meet you.
- Sora.

2285
01:21:28,590 --> 01:21:29,890
- It's crazy, right?
- Things are so hectic.

2286
01:21:29,890 --> 01:21:32,330
- This is so exhausting. Hello.
- Goodness.

2287
01:21:32,330 --> 01:21:34,590
- All three of you are here.
- Okay.

2288
01:21:34,590 --> 01:21:36,230
- You can go to this address.
- Okay.

2289
01:21:36,230 --> 01:21:37,970
- That's SBS.
- You know where it is, right?

2290
01:21:37,970 --> 01:21:39,210
Yes, it's SBS.

2291
01:21:39,210 --> 01:21:40,710
See? You were with us. I told you.

2292
01:21:40,710 --> 01:21:42,710
- Right.
- See?

2293
01:21:42,710 --> 01:21:44,550
- I'm sorry.
- You were with us.

2294
01:21:45,300 --> 01:21:46,580
Hold on.

2295
01:21:46,770 --> 01:21:48,550
- Yes.
- Where are you?

2296
01:21:48,920 --> 01:21:49,940
Tell So Min...

2297
01:21:49,940 --> 01:21:51,440
I don't know.
I'm done with today's filming.

2298
01:21:51,440 --> 01:21:52,440
(He's totally exhausted.)

2299
01:21:52,620 --> 01:21:54,760
- I'm done with today's filming.
- Why all of a sudden?

2300
01:21:55,260 --> 01:21:57,550
- He's angry.
- Sung Oh, where are you?

2301
01:21:58,150 --> 01:22:01,190
Gosh, there's a limit.
No one told me what to do.

2302
01:22:01,190 --> 01:22:02,430
Sung Oh.

2303
01:22:02,430 --> 01:22:03,670
- Hello?
- Right away?

2304
01:22:03,670 --> 01:22:06,670
You must be very upset.
I'm the writer of the show.

2305
01:22:06,670 --> 01:22:08,190
I see. Hello.

2306
01:22:08,190 --> 01:22:09,670
(Suddenly acting polite)

2307
01:22:09,670 --> 01:22:13,170
Things have gotten slightly mixed
up here. Who's on your team?

2308
01:22:14,340 --> 01:22:15,680
- My team?
- Yes.

2309
01:22:16,710 --> 01:22:18,010
Jae Hong will know.

2310
01:22:18,800 --> 01:22:19,940
Hold on.

2311
01:22:20,010 --> 01:22:21,640
Jae Hong will know.

2312
01:22:22,270 --> 01:22:23,310
Hello?

2313
01:22:23,510 --> 01:22:26,120
See? Everyone on the show is weird.

2314
01:22:26,890 --> 01:22:29,890
Wait, I see someone.
Hey, Se Chan got off.

2315
01:22:29,890 --> 01:22:30,980
Where?

2316
01:22:31,720 --> 01:22:33,390
Can't you bring my phone?

2317
01:22:33,590 --> 01:22:35,960
I don't even think I'm on his team.

2318
01:22:35,960 --> 01:22:38,170
- Isn't that So Min?
- Right.

2319
01:22:38,170 --> 01:22:39,670
- I can just bring her here, right?
- Yes.

2320
01:22:39,670 --> 01:22:41,590
Hey, So Min! Come over here!

2321
01:22:41,590 --> 01:22:43,800
- Come here. Hi.
- Hello.

2322
01:22:43,800 --> 01:22:45,430
Jong Kook. Hello.

2323
01:22:45,430 --> 01:22:46,680
- You're on my team. Come here.
- I am?

2324
01:22:46,680 --> 01:22:49,300
- No.
- The three of us.

2325
01:22:49,300 --> 01:22:52,050
- Hello.
- I'm on Jae Hong's team.

2326
01:22:52,300 --> 01:22:54,620
We're on the same team.
The three of us.

2327
01:22:55,140 --> 01:22:58,390
So Min. The three of us...

2328
01:22:58,620 --> 01:23:00,550
Hey, Haha is running away
through the trunk.

2329
01:23:00,550 --> 01:23:03,180
- Hey, the trunk won't open.
- Hold on a second.

2330
01:23:03,180 --> 01:23:05,630
- Hey, get in.
- I'm on Jae Hong's team.

2331
01:23:05,630 --> 01:23:07,630
I'm on Jae Hong's team.

2332
01:23:08,090 --> 01:23:09,960
- Hey.
- I'm on Jae Hong's team.

2333
01:23:09,960 --> 01:23:11,690
(Haha manages to escape.)

2334
01:23:11,690 --> 01:23:13,670
- Where's Jae Hong?
- Let's hurry!

2335
01:23:13,670 --> 01:23:14,870
Let's hurry.

2336
01:23:15,760 --> 01:23:17,540
- Haha.
- Right here.

2337
01:23:19,710 --> 01:23:21,680
- Hurry.
- All right.

2338
01:23:21,680 --> 01:23:23,100
(The 3 members of Team Jae Hong
meet after a long chase.)

2339
01:23:23,750 --> 01:23:25,340
- Is this our team?
- Yes.

2340
01:23:25,340 --> 01:23:27,080
- Your team has been formed.
- Hurry.

2341
01:23:27,080 --> 01:23:28,720
- Hurry!
- Yes!

2342
01:23:28,720 --> 01:23:30,510
Get in. Everyone is leaving now!

2343
01:23:30,510 --> 01:23:32,510
- Jae Hong said I was on his team.
- You idiot.

2344
01:23:32,510 --> 01:23:33,890
You idiot.

2345
01:23:34,720 --> 01:23:36,550
- Darn it. Hurry. Sung Oh, come.
- What's going on?

2346
01:23:36,550 --> 01:23:37,830
Wait, he and I aren't
on the same team?

2347
01:23:37,830 --> 01:23:39,090
He totally fooled you.

2348
01:23:39,090 --> 01:23:41,390
Why didn't you answer your phone?

2349
01:23:41,390 --> 01:23:44,020
- He said I was on his team.
- You should've answered your phone.

2350
01:23:44,020 --> 01:23:45,890
- Goodness.
- Listen.

2351
01:23:46,330 --> 01:23:48,670
Just because he said so,
you're on his team?

2352
01:23:48,890 --> 01:23:50,230
He's not the type to lie.

2353
01:23:50,230 --> 01:23:51,400
Ridiculous.

2354
01:23:51,400 --> 01:23:53,430
Your agency
won't pick up their phone.

2355
01:23:53,430 --> 01:23:55,180
Why did you keep calling
the agencies?

2356
01:23:55,180 --> 01:23:57,770
- I don't know your phone numbers.
- If you called them in the morning,

2357
01:23:57,770 --> 01:24:00,340
who would give you our numbers?

2358
01:24:00,340 --> 01:24:02,010
(Which team will win the race?)

2359
01:24:02,310 --> 01:24:04,180
(Humans have one strong instinct.)

2360
01:24:04,180 --> 01:24:05,890
(This instinct always rules over
humans wherever and whenever.)

2361
01:24:05,890 --> 01:24:07,420
(Their instinct to survive)

2362
01:24:07,980 --> 01:24:10,630
(Humans struggle to survive
even in extreme situations.)

2363
01:24:11,330 --> 01:24:13,220
(However,)

2364
01:24:13,220 --> 01:24:15,520
(there's the Grim Reaper
who is jealous of human life.)

2365
01:24:15,520 --> 01:24:18,590
(They cannot find out
its shape, smell, or sound.)

2366
01:24:19,090 --> 01:24:21,590
(They will only hear
people's screams.)

2367
01:24:21,590 --> 01:24:23,900
(At that moment,
a piece of truth is discovered.)

2368
01:24:23,900 --> 01:24:24,970
Hold on. Are you all Grim Reapers?

2369
01:24:24,970 --> 01:24:26,880
(There are more Grim Reapers now.)

2370
01:24:27,210 --> 01:24:28,230
Be careful!

2371
01:24:28,230 --> 01:24:31,210
(The survival mystery thriller
between two worlds in 2020)

2372
01:24:32,100 --> 01:24:33,300
(If they can't get away
from the Grim Reapers,)

2373
01:24:33,300 --> 01:24:35,270
(a tragedy awaits the humans.)

2374
01:24:36,140 --> 01:24:38,220
(If you want to survive as a human,
use every means possible.)
