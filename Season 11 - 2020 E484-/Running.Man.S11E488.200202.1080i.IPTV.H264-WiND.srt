1
00:00:04,680 --> 00:00:06,070
- Hello.
- Hello.

2
00:00:06,070 --> 00:00:08,410
So Min dressed up today.

3
00:00:08,490 --> 00:00:09,780
I'm wearing dress shoes
in a long while.

4
00:00:09,780 --> 00:00:12,280
- Hello.
- Hello.

5
00:00:12,280 --> 00:00:14,120
I'm wearing dress shoes
in a long while.

6
00:00:14,120 --> 00:00:16,560
Actually, Jong Kook is
on a new show. I saw it.

7
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:18,190
- "Fly Shootdori".
- Things have gotten friendly now.

8
00:00:18,190 --> 00:00:20,250
- You're promoting other shows.
- Right.

9
00:00:20,250 --> 00:00:22,100
- We're a real family.
- Right.

10
00:00:22,100 --> 00:00:24,640
- I started filming "Fly Shootdori."
- Yes.

11
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:25,940
Se Chan is on the show with you.

12
00:00:25,940 --> 00:00:27,490
- Se Chan.
- Jong Kook,

13
00:00:27,490 --> 00:00:29,100
- didn't you help him get cast?
- Yes, he practically hired me.

14
00:00:29,100 --> 00:00:31,800
I found out that
we're filming in Taebaek.

15
00:00:31,910 --> 00:00:33,780
We have to film for two days
when I go down there.

16
00:00:33,780 --> 00:00:35,600
I thought
I would be really bored there,

17
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:37,250
so I decided to take
one of my sidekicks.

18
00:00:37,300 --> 00:00:39,340
Jong Kook, is that
why you picked me?

19
00:00:39,870 --> 00:00:41,480
That's why you brought me there.

20
00:00:41,480 --> 00:00:43,120
It will be so boring if I go
there alone. Don't you agree?

21
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:44,120
Right.

22
00:00:44,120 --> 00:00:46,880
- I feel comfortable around him.
- In a nutshell, he's your doll.

23
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:48,050
- Right.
- Yes.

24
00:00:48,050 --> 00:00:49,730
He keeps me in his pocket.

25
00:00:49,730 --> 00:00:50,930
When he tells me to come out,
I come out.

26
00:00:50,930 --> 00:00:52,860
He's a doll you keep next to you
when going to sleep.

27
00:00:52,860 --> 00:00:54,000
I knew it.

28
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,560
Doll Chan, you're something else.

29
00:00:55,560 --> 00:00:57,120
- Doll Chan.
- Doll Chan.

30
00:00:57,120 --> 00:00:58,660
It's a combination of
"doll" and "Se Chan."

31
00:00:58,660 --> 00:01:00,190
- Seriously.
- My gosh.

32
00:01:00,190 --> 00:01:01,510
That's crazy.

33
00:01:01,510 --> 00:01:04,680
So Min was bored either
at the end or in the beginning...

34
00:01:04,830 --> 00:01:07,940
of the year,
so she called Se Chan.

35
00:01:07,940 --> 00:01:10,340
Se Chan told her that
he was on his way to Taebaek.

36
00:01:10,610 --> 00:01:12,670
- She said she was very lonely...
- Really?

37
00:01:12,670 --> 00:01:13,920
- at the beginning of the year.
- I'm sorry.

38
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:15,950
I took away the doll
you're attached to.

39
00:01:15,950 --> 00:01:17,310
Gosh, the doll she's attached to?

40
00:01:17,310 --> 00:01:20,590
(The conflict of the custody
around the doll)

41
00:01:20,590 --> 00:01:22,860
- I'm a doll?
- Hey, let's share him.

42
00:01:22,860 --> 00:01:23,890
Let's share him.

43
00:01:23,890 --> 00:01:25,750
- He's a doll I cannot touch.
- Is that so?

44
00:01:25,750 --> 00:01:28,920
- I see.
- When it snowed earlier,

45
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:32,000
So Min was standing by the window
and was watching the snow...

46
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,700
by herself. I thought to myself,
"My gosh, So Min."

47
00:01:34,700 --> 00:01:37,310
But the automatic door opened,
and she got squashed.

48
00:01:37,310 --> 00:01:39,110
(But the automatic door opened,
and she got squashed.)

49
00:01:40,580 --> 00:01:42,200
- She's a true TV entertainer.
- I'm serious.

50
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:44,200
- She's a real TV entertainer.
- I missed that.

51
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:46,140
- I should have seen that.
- So Min, what were you doing?

52
00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:48,920
- I was so embarrassed.
- Her life is entertaining.

53
00:01:49,310 --> 00:01:52,060
Before you start your race,
only one guest will join you today.

54
00:01:52,060 --> 00:01:53,480
- We only invited one.
- Really?

55
00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:55,360
- There's only one guest.
- Really?

56
00:01:55,660 --> 00:01:56,980
Please come on in.

57
00:01:56,980 --> 00:01:58,830
- Gosh, it's the only guest today.
- Who is it?

58
00:01:58,830 --> 00:02:00,360
- The only guest of the day.
- The stairs?

59
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:01,860
- It's been a while.
- The guest is coming. Who is it?

60
00:02:01,860 --> 00:02:04,500
She's wearing a pink jacket
and boots.

61
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:06,000
It's been a while
since I saw those long boots.

62
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
People usually wear them
when they go horseback riding.

63
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,840
I think she's been on variety shows.

64
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,140
- She's...
- She's very... Is that Jin Young?

65
00:02:12,410 --> 00:02:13,470
- Who is it?
- Who is it?

66
00:02:13,780 --> 00:02:15,150
- It's not Jin Young.
- Han Na?

67
00:02:15,150 --> 00:02:16,280
- Is she...
- Hello.

68
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:18,370
- It's Ha Na.
- It's Ha Na.

69
00:02:18,410 --> 00:02:23,020
(The actress won over the viewers
with her countless charms.)

70
00:02:23,310 --> 00:02:24,780
- My goodness.
- Please stand in the middle.

71
00:02:24,780 --> 00:02:26,160
- How are you? It's been a while.
- Park Ha Na.

72
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:28,660
We were told we'd have
only one guest, and Ha Na came.

73
00:02:29,320 --> 00:02:33,090
Ha Na... I think you were
on our show quite recently.

74
00:02:33,090 --> 00:02:34,400
- It's been a year.
- Really?

75
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:37,090
- It's already been a year?
- I saw a rerun of the episode.

76
00:02:37,090 --> 00:02:38,740
- Right.
- Yes.

77
00:02:38,740 --> 00:02:40,840
Well, today... My goodness.

78
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:43,740
This is the first one on the list.
It's underlined in blue.

79
00:02:43,740 --> 00:02:45,680
The writer added three stars
on this.

80
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:48,040
- You'll show us your EDM dance.
- All of a sudden?

81
00:02:48,040 --> 00:02:50,100
- Jae Suk, are you serious?
- Before saying hi to the viewers?

82
00:02:50,100 --> 00:02:51,680
- My gosh.
- That's all right.

83
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:52,810
- That's so 2020.
- You can do it.

84
00:02:52,810 --> 00:02:55,810
These days, we don't build up
to reach the climax.

85
00:02:55,810 --> 00:02:57,880
We cut to the chase right away.

86
00:02:57,880 --> 00:03:00,520
- Let's go.
- Ha Na, can you show us the dance?

87
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:01,880
- Of course.
- Great.

88
00:03:01,880 --> 00:03:04,790
It's embarrassing to dance
by myself.

89
00:03:04,790 --> 00:03:06,500
- I brought friends.
- Where?

90
00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:07,900
- What?
- What friends?

91
00:03:07,900 --> 00:03:09,090
Did you bring dancers?

92
00:03:09,090 --> 00:03:10,470
- Yes.
- She brought dancers.

93
00:03:10,470 --> 00:03:11,970
She came determined.

94
00:03:12,290 --> 00:03:13,660
- Buddies!
- What?

95
00:03:14,290 --> 00:03:15,740
My gosh. Goodness.

96
00:03:15,740 --> 00:03:17,840
(Surprised)

97
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:18,840
What's that?

98
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:20,130
(Ha Na's friends shock everyone.)

99
00:03:20,130 --> 00:03:22,310
- They are real parrots.
- What's going on?

100
00:03:22,310 --> 00:03:23,370
(Ha Na's friends, 2 parrots)

101
00:03:23,870 --> 00:03:24,910
Really?

102
00:03:24,910 --> 00:03:26,120
Are they shy?

103
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:27,340
My friends!

104
00:03:27,620 --> 00:03:30,020
- So Min's nickname is Parrot.
- They are my friends too.

105
00:03:30,020 --> 00:03:31,590
By the way, they are beautiful.

106
00:03:32,460 --> 00:03:35,060
- Ha Na, how old are they?
- Yes?

107
00:03:35,060 --> 00:03:37,780
So this one is Nana.

108
00:03:37,780 --> 00:03:40,120
I think it's five years old.
I adopted Nana.

109
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:42,500
- You adopted Nana.
- Gguggu is...

110
00:03:42,500 --> 00:03:44,970
- eight months old.
- It sat on your finger.

111
00:03:45,190 --> 00:03:46,940
- They are beautiful.
- That's fascinating.

112
00:03:46,940 --> 00:03:48,560
It went to Ha Na.

113
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:50,630
Will it come if I put my finger
here? It came to me too.

114
00:03:51,710 --> 00:03:52,780
Hello.

115
00:03:52,780 --> 00:03:53,870
- How interesting.
- That one...

116
00:03:53,870 --> 00:03:56,000
- easily makes friends.
- Don't come. You won't come? Don't.

117
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:59,120
I think Nana is going to dig out
Suk Jin's earwax.

118
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:01,380
- He's about to cry.
- My gosh.

119
00:04:02,150 --> 00:04:03,220
- Nana is friendly.
- What's going on?

120
00:04:03,220 --> 00:04:04,720
It's eating your shirt.

121
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:06,120
- No, he doesn't have a lot of hair.
- Do they bite?

122
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:07,410
- Suk Jin.
- No.

123
00:04:07,410 --> 00:04:09,160
- It's so loud.
- He doesn't have a lot of hair.

124
00:04:09,160 --> 00:04:10,930
- Suk Jin.
- No.

125
00:04:10,930 --> 00:04:12,350
(Every strand of hair
is so precious to him.)

126
00:04:12,350 --> 00:04:14,190
It's eating lice
from Suk Jin's hair.

127
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:16,290
It was eating lice.

128
00:04:16,290 --> 00:04:17,290
He should put it on his shoulder.

129
00:04:17,290 --> 00:04:19,690
Jong Kook, try it on Se Chan.
Let's see he'll come to you.

130
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:24,510
(Is Se Chan a bird?)

131
00:04:25,410 --> 00:04:26,410
Can it talk?

132
00:04:26,410 --> 00:04:29,410
That depends on the species.
They can't talk.

133
00:04:29,410 --> 00:04:31,280
- But they can dance.
- What?

134
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:33,520
- You'll dance with them?
- Yes.

135
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:34,720
- Nana can dance.
- Really?

136
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:36,320
- Really?
- She can dance.

137
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:38,850
Let's watch Ha Na's EDM dance
with Nana.

138
00:04:38,850 --> 00:04:40,890
- Let's start with that.
- I need Gguggu.

139
00:04:40,890 --> 00:04:43,180
- It doesn't look like it'll dance.
- Gguggu needs to help us.

140
00:04:43,180 --> 00:04:45,030
That's intriguing. It's so calm.

141
00:04:45,030 --> 00:04:46,990
I've only seen this
on "How Is That Possible?"

142
00:04:46,990 --> 00:04:48,860
I've never seen this in person.

143
00:04:48,860 --> 00:04:50,400
- A dancing parrot.
- Right.

144
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:52,900
You can do it, right?
Please help me.

145
00:04:52,900 --> 00:04:54,400
- Help me out.
- Let's watch Nana's dance.

146
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:56,510
- Nana.
- Nana.

147
00:04:56,510 --> 00:04:59,010
(Their eyes are on the parrot.)

148
00:04:59,010 --> 00:05:00,140
What is it?

149
00:05:00,510 --> 00:05:03,080
Look at the wings. They are moving.

150
00:05:05,610 --> 00:05:06,610
What?

151
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:09,110
- It's dancing.
- The wings are moving.

152
00:05:09,110 --> 00:05:10,320
(Dancing)

153
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:11,520
- Seriously?
- My gosh.

154
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:13,480
(What on earth is this?)

155
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:17,890
- Look at the body roll.
- It's dancing to the rhythm.

156
00:05:20,090 --> 00:05:21,130
It's really dancing.

157
00:05:21,130 --> 00:05:22,130
(It even danced on beat!)

158
00:05:25,270 --> 00:05:27,270
It's coming down.
It's on the stage now.

159
00:05:27,490 --> 00:05:28,930
- Okay.
- It's on the stage.

160
00:05:29,570 --> 00:05:30,970
Nana needs a partner to dance.

161
00:05:35,470 --> 00:05:37,300
(Copying the parrot)

162
00:05:37,300 --> 00:05:38,340
Nana needs a partner.

163
00:05:38,610 --> 00:05:40,910
(Suk Jin is having a blast
with Nana's trick.)

164
00:05:40,910 --> 00:05:43,390
In my opinion,
Nana danced really well.

165
00:05:43,390 --> 00:05:44,390
Right.

166
00:05:44,780 --> 00:05:46,850
(Nana dances better at home.)

167
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:48,780
It was better than I expected.

168
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:52,130
- Nana. Gguggu. Thank you.
- Thank you.

169
00:05:52,130 --> 00:05:53,790
That was so much fun.

170
00:05:53,790 --> 00:05:57,090
When they played the EDM track,
I was really surprised to see...

171
00:05:57,090 --> 00:05:59,160
So Min doing
the outdated dance move.

172
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:00,860
With the EDM music?

173
00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:02,210
(The female warrior
of techno music is summoned.)

174
00:06:02,210 --> 00:06:03,410
That's for techno music.

175
00:06:04,100 --> 00:06:05,100
That's for techno music.

176
00:06:05,100 --> 00:06:08,100
She did a move for techno music
when they played the EDM music.

177
00:06:08,100 --> 00:06:10,380
All right. Let's wrap up here.

178
00:06:10,380 --> 00:06:12,540
Wait, Ha Na. Did you prepare
another dance performance?

179
00:06:12,540 --> 00:06:13,720
- She prepared a lot.
- I prepared a lot.

180
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:15,520
Earlier, her pets danced.

181
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:17,040
Will you dance this time?

182
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:19,280
Yes, I prepared to dance
to Jong Kook's song.

183
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:20,610
- My song?
- Which song?

184
00:06:20,610 --> 00:06:23,160
My songs are oldies of old songs.

185
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:24,590
It's "Black Cat."

186
00:06:24,590 --> 00:06:26,350
- That's an old song.
- I'll show you a snippet.

187
00:06:26,350 --> 00:06:28,860
- All right. Ha Na.
- "Black Cat Nero".

188
00:06:28,860 --> 00:06:32,030
- Dance to "Black Cat Nero."
- I'll show you a snippet.

189
00:06:32,030 --> 00:06:33,340
I feel shy now.

190
00:06:34,700 --> 00:06:37,930
(As soon as the intro begins,
she bounces like a cat.)

191
00:06:37,930 --> 00:06:39,100
Is this how you dance to the song?

192
00:06:39,100 --> 00:06:40,840
- That's correct.
- Is this how it goes?

193
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:43,800
- Just like that.
- She's got swagger.

194
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:45,170
- Yes.
- Is this it?

195
00:06:45,910 --> 00:06:47,110
She should come to your concert.

196
00:06:47,110 --> 00:06:48,220
- She's a cat.
- That move.

197
00:06:48,220 --> 00:06:49,650
She should come to your concert.

198
00:06:49,650 --> 00:06:50,680
(Let's go back to the 90s!)

199
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:52,660
- In 1, 2.
- Go.

200
00:06:54,180 --> 00:06:56,980
(She transforms into a powerful cat
from a gentle cat.)

201
00:06:58,260 --> 00:06:59,720
What? What was that all of a sudden?

202
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:02,400
(Fluttering away her pink jacket)

203
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:03,720
- She's amazing.
- Is that the right move?

204
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:06,090
That's right.
That's one of the moves.

205
00:07:06,090 --> 00:07:07,470
That's the dance for the bridge.

206
00:07:07,790 --> 00:07:09,360
(She finishes
with a cute kitty act.)

207
00:07:09,930 --> 00:07:11,410
- Ha Na.
- Thank you.

208
00:07:11,410 --> 00:07:14,730
I'm sorry to ask you this,
but what was the last move?

209
00:07:14,730 --> 00:07:16,800
- I didn't memorize that part.
- I see.

210
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:18,470
- Is that why?
- I felt shy.

211
00:07:18,470 --> 00:07:20,320
But she works hard.

212
00:07:20,320 --> 00:07:21,320
- Yes.
- She works hard.

213
00:07:21,320 --> 00:07:23,910
The dance moves were really funny.

214
00:07:23,910 --> 00:07:25,020
(It's funny?)

215
00:07:25,020 --> 00:07:27,020
Funny? Did you say it's funny?

216
00:07:27,020 --> 00:07:29,030
- Why are you leading the show?
- Jong Kook's life...

217
00:07:29,030 --> 00:07:30,680
- is in that song.
- No, it's not that.

218
00:07:30,680 --> 00:07:31,720
But it's funny?

219
00:07:32,760 --> 00:07:34,030
Jong Kook, why don't you
demonstrate for us?

220
00:07:34,030 --> 00:07:36,270
- Why are you leading the show?
- Why would I do that?

221
00:07:36,270 --> 00:07:38,360
- Why would I do that?
- Shall we do it together?

222
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:41,570
To be honest, you didn't even
memorize the routine properly.

223
00:07:41,640 --> 00:07:44,710
I would've done it
if you memorized it properly.

224
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:47,670
To tell you the truth,
I couldn't make big reactions.

225
00:07:48,140 --> 00:07:49,910
- Well, she worked hard.
- I want to see the original dance.

226
00:07:49,910 --> 00:07:52,220
- She didn't have much time.
- Right.

227
00:07:52,220 --> 00:07:54,340
- We should see the original dance.
- Right.

228
00:07:54,380 --> 00:07:56,020
- Jong Kook.
- Yes?

229
00:07:56,020 --> 00:07:57,110
Dance for us.

230
00:07:57,110 --> 00:07:59,050
- Do you want me in the back?
- It's been so long.

231
00:07:59,050 --> 00:08:00,220
- Should I join too?
- You should do it too.

232
00:08:00,220 --> 00:08:01,960
- By the way,
- You guys, stand in the back.

233
00:08:01,960 --> 00:08:05,220
when he was active as Turbo,
he didn't dance zealously.

234
00:08:05,220 --> 00:08:07,200
Right. By the way, both of them...

235
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:09,200
- rapped at my concerts.
- Really?

236
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:10,920
- So he can...
- I'm the first Kim Jung Nam.

237
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:12,200
- He's the second Kim Jung Nam.
- Right.

238
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:14,030
I can even do Mikey's part.

239
00:08:14,030 --> 00:08:15,210
(He can do Mikey's part.)

240
00:08:15,410 --> 00:08:17,270
- Haha is Jong Kook's first doll.
- Right.

241
00:08:17,270 --> 00:08:18,930
- He's the 2nd doll.
- I'm the 2nd one.

242
00:08:18,930 --> 00:08:21,410
- Kwang Soo is a temporary one.
- It goes like this.

243
00:08:21,410 --> 00:08:23,600
- Do we just repeat this?
- He threw Kwang Soo out.

244
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:26,320
All right. Play the music.

245
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:29,180
- My gosh.
- Great.

246
00:08:30,390 --> 00:08:32,610
(Dancing in sync)

247
00:08:32,610 --> 00:08:33,850
- They look cute.
- Don't you dare...

248
00:08:33,850 --> 00:08:36,420
- go in front of Jong Kook.
- You should join them.

249
00:08:36,920 --> 00:08:39,730
Ha Na. Why did you go
in front of him?

250
00:08:39,730 --> 00:08:41,290
(At a glance,
it looks like Turbo has united.)

251
00:08:41,290 --> 00:08:43,460
- Stand behind Jong Kook.
- You're doing great.

252
00:08:43,460 --> 00:08:45,500
- You're doing great.
- Make Jong Kook stand out.

253
00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:46,770
All right.

254
00:08:47,870 --> 00:08:49,870
(It's as if Turbo is back.)

255
00:08:51,110 --> 00:08:52,380
(I can't believe
I'm seeing this in person.)

256
00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:55,980
- That's so cool.
- Right. That was the move.

257
00:08:55,980 --> 00:08:57,040
This move.

258
00:08:59,910 --> 00:09:01,480
Gosh, they are so in sync.

259
00:09:02,410 --> 00:09:03,410
This is the part.

260
00:09:03,410 --> 00:09:04,750
(This is the part for Jung Nams.)

261
00:09:05,410 --> 00:09:07,160
- Go.
- It's war.

262
00:09:07,180 --> 00:09:08,530
(As soon as he says, "go,"
they dance intensely.)

263
00:09:08,550 --> 00:09:10,130
Great job. Nice.

264
00:09:11,230 --> 00:09:13,190
- Great.
<i>- You're too young for it</i>

265
00:09:13,660 --> 00:09:15,320
(Greatly satisfied)

266
00:09:15,870 --> 00:09:17,030
- Cut it. That's enough.
- Nice.

267
00:09:17,030 --> 00:09:18,560
- That's it.
- Great job.

268
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:19,690
Great job!

269
00:09:19,690 --> 00:09:21,290
- You know what?
- I knew it.

270
00:09:21,290 --> 00:09:22,700
- You are my dolls.
- Jong Kook.

271
00:09:23,140 --> 00:09:25,910
- My dolls.
- Dolls.

272
00:09:26,010 --> 00:09:27,530
I felt so bad for them.

273
00:09:27,530 --> 00:09:30,040
- Why? I do it because I want to.
- Two of them did the same part.

274
00:09:30,650 --> 00:09:31,850
Goodness.

275
00:09:31,850 --> 00:09:33,350
(A tear-jerking scene
of sharing the same part)

276
00:09:33,350 --> 00:09:35,850
After the intro,
Jong Kook was resting in the back.

277
00:09:36,020 --> 00:09:38,040
I rest up here and get ready.

278
00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:39,160
- I catch my breath.
- Right.

279
00:09:39,410 --> 00:09:41,760
Thanks to Ha Na,

280
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:43,760
- Jong Kook performed.
- Right.

281
00:09:43,860 --> 00:09:46,690
- I suddenly danced to an old song.
- Right. All of a sudden.

282
00:09:47,230 --> 00:09:48,920
If this is all you can do,

283
00:09:48,920 --> 00:09:50,290
don't say that you prepared
a dance performance.

284
00:09:50,290 --> 00:09:53,140
(Don't say that you prepared
a dance performance.)

285
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:56,830
- It didn't deserve three stars.
- You know this wasn't...

286
00:09:56,830 --> 00:09:58,670
There were three stars next to it.

287
00:09:58,910 --> 00:10:00,480
- It didn't deserve three stars.
- Right.

288
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:01,750
I'm not sure if you know this,

289
00:10:01,750 --> 00:10:04,170
but we wrapped up the mess
you created.

290
00:10:04,350 --> 00:10:06,210
- We wrapped it up.
- We cleaned it up.

291
00:10:06,980 --> 00:10:09,490
- We did all the finishing touches.
- Okay.

292
00:10:09,490 --> 00:10:10,810
- You guys are brutal.
- It was somewhat lacking.

293
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:13,180
I'll explain the rules now.

294
00:10:13,210 --> 00:10:15,660
Today's race is called
Empty House: Oh, My Thieves.

295
00:10:15,660 --> 00:10:18,630
You are nine thieves who are eyeing
the valuables in a mansion.

296
00:10:18,630 --> 00:10:19,760
(They are 9 thieves
after valuables.)

297
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:20,760
We are thieves?

298
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,660
There will be three per team.

299
00:10:22,660 --> 00:10:26,430
The mansion owner will go out
from 3 p.m. to 5 p.m.

300
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:27,790
There's the mansion owner.

301
00:10:27,870 --> 00:10:30,430
You must steal valuables
when the mansion is empty.

302
00:10:30,430 --> 00:10:33,610
The team with the most money
will win and receive a prize.

303
00:10:33,610 --> 00:10:35,610
And the losing
team will face a penalty.

304
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:37,780
However, in the mansion,

305
00:10:37,780 --> 00:10:39,850
there is the Tear of Yondu necklace.
It costs 30 million dollars...

306
00:10:39,850 --> 00:10:42,250
which is more expensive
than all the valuables combined.

307
00:10:42,250 --> 00:10:44,310
- Tear of Yondu?
- Tear of Yondu?

308
00:10:44,390 --> 00:10:45,520
Tear of Yondu?

309
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:48,730
- Tear of Yondu. That's her.
- There's another one here.

310
00:10:48,730 --> 00:10:50,260
I can cry as much as you want me to.

311
00:10:50,530 --> 00:10:53,400
Obtaining the gem will guarantee
a victory for your team.

312
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:55,530
Please look for it thoroughly.

313
00:10:55,790 --> 00:10:57,790
The team of three thieves
consists of...

314
00:10:57,790 --> 00:11:00,370
a firearms expert, hacker,
and appraiser.

315
00:11:00,370 --> 00:11:01,930
A firearms expert
who will be the captain...

316
00:11:01,930 --> 00:11:03,770
will get a water gun that allows
them to eliminate a member.

317
00:11:03,830 --> 00:11:06,380
And an appraiser will get a tool
that distinguishes valuables...

318
00:11:06,380 --> 00:11:08,010
between expensive and cheap ones.

319
00:11:08,010 --> 00:11:09,040
And for hackers,

320
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:11,650
it's advantageous
to select the smartest member.

321
00:11:12,980 --> 00:11:14,280
I'm probably a hacker.

322
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:15,540
Some of you can't be.

323
00:11:15,540 --> 00:11:17,440
Before you start,
you'll select your teams first.

324
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:19,680
We appointed the captain
of each team.

325
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:21,390
Captain Yoo Jae Suk.

326
00:11:21,410 --> 00:11:22,580
Captain Kim Jong Kook.

327
00:11:22,580 --> 00:11:24,160
And Captain Haha.

328
00:11:24,580 --> 00:11:25,600
I'm sorry to interrupt,

329
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:27,000
- but shouldn't it be Suk Jin?
- What about Suk Jin?

330
00:11:27,290 --> 00:11:28,790
One of them should be Suk Jin.

331
00:11:28,790 --> 00:11:29,900
(He was defeated mysteriously.)

332
00:11:29,900 --> 00:11:31,130
- Aren't you being too cruel?
- By the way...

333
00:11:31,160 --> 00:11:33,140
- He was waiting for his name.
- Listen.

334
00:11:33,140 --> 00:11:34,640
As soon as
he talked about captains...

335
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:36,700
I was trying hard
to keep a straight face.

336
00:11:37,370 --> 00:11:38,610
His face turned dark.

337
00:11:38,610 --> 00:11:40,410
- You should let him be a captain.
- My gosh, seriously.

338
00:11:40,670 --> 00:11:41,780
Gosh, this is so weird.

339
00:11:41,780 --> 00:11:42,940
Team Member Ji, join me.

340
00:11:43,350 --> 00:11:44,440
Join me.

341
00:11:44,980 --> 00:11:47,210
(Since you're smart, be a hacker.)

342
00:11:47,210 --> 00:11:49,990
The three of you will play
rock-paper-scissors.

343
00:11:49,990 --> 00:11:53,580
The winner will get to choose
their members first.

344
00:11:53,580 --> 00:11:55,490
Really?
Will we play rock-paper-scissors?

345
00:11:55,490 --> 00:11:57,260
- Play it and pick one member.
- Let's do it.

346
00:11:57,260 --> 00:11:58,820
- I'm a hacker.
- We should step back.

347
00:11:58,820 --> 00:11:59,950
<i>- Rock-paper-scissors
- Rock-paper-scissors</i>

348
00:12:02,660 --> 00:12:03,820
<i>- Rock-paper-scissors
- Rock-paper-scissors</i>

349
00:12:03,820 --> 00:12:04,920
(Jae Suk gets to choose first.)

350
00:12:04,920 --> 00:12:06,830
- Okay!
- What are you talking about?

351
00:12:07,100 --> 00:12:08,870
Come on, Kwang Soo.

352
00:12:09,410 --> 00:12:10,660
Suk Jin is the smartest one.

353
00:12:10,660 --> 00:12:12,380
- Hold on. Do I choose a hacker?
- Yes.

354
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:14,330
- Pick a smart member.
- Class president in sixth grade.

355
00:12:14,510 --> 00:12:15,780
I was the class president
in the 7th grade...

356
00:12:15,780 --> 00:12:17,010
and vice president in the 8th grade.

357
00:12:17,010 --> 00:12:18,150
- Go back to your spot.
- Hey.

358
00:12:18,670 --> 00:12:20,670
(Listing her achievements
to be a hacker doesn't work.)

359
00:12:20,670 --> 00:12:22,410
Can't you tell just
by looking at me?

360
00:12:23,410 --> 00:12:26,360
Right. I can see that you're old.

361
00:12:26,620 --> 00:12:29,130
(He's not a hacker. He's just old.)

362
00:12:29,130 --> 00:12:31,360
- It wasn't "aged." He said "old."
- Suk Jin.

363
00:12:31,490 --> 00:12:33,420
- Suk Jin, it's your face.
- You look very tired.

364
00:12:33,420 --> 00:12:34,730
My gosh, you punk.

365
00:12:34,730 --> 00:12:37,400
I'm good at the acrostic poems.

366
00:12:38,270 --> 00:12:39,600
- You're good at acrostic poems?
- Yes.

367
00:12:39,640 --> 00:12:42,300
- You must be smart for that.
- Give it a try.

368
00:12:42,300 --> 00:12:43,830
- Give it a try.
- Hold on.

369
00:12:43,910 --> 00:12:45,930
You keep starting things,
but you can't finish them.

370
00:12:45,930 --> 00:12:47,610
- Do we have to finish this too?
- No.

371
00:12:47,610 --> 00:12:49,250
- Stop making us clean up your mess.
- Where are you going?

372
00:12:49,250 --> 00:12:50,940
- Hold on.
- Where are you going?

373
00:12:50,940 --> 00:12:52,410
Don't make a mess here.

374
00:12:52,410 --> 00:12:54,040
I shouldn't have asked her to do it.

375
00:12:54,040 --> 00:12:55,250
Why did you say that?

376
00:12:55,250 --> 00:12:56,620
- Why did you do that?
- Goodness.

377
00:12:56,710 --> 00:12:58,710
- She likes to show off.
- My goodness.

378
00:12:58,710 --> 00:13:00,950
- Will she do it with her parrots?
- For acrostic poems?

379
00:13:00,950 --> 00:13:02,630
- She should...
- Will the parrots recite the poems?

380
00:13:02,630 --> 00:13:03,860
(The more enthusiastic she gets,
the more anxious they are.)

381
00:13:03,860 --> 00:13:05,360
Her poem must be really good.

382
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:06,550
- She's coming.
- Here she comes.

383
00:13:06,730 --> 00:13:07,820
- She's coming?
- Where did she go?

384
00:13:07,820 --> 00:13:09,460
Where did she go to prepare
for her acrostic poem?

385
00:13:09,560 --> 00:13:10,660
- What did you do?
- What was that?

386
00:13:10,660 --> 00:13:12,370
- Where did you go?
- Did you go to the bathroom?

387
00:13:12,870 --> 00:13:15,740
I prepared acrostic poems
for all eight of you.

388
00:13:15,740 --> 00:13:16,770
- Eight poems?
- I know I can't...

389
00:13:16,770 --> 00:13:18,140
We don't have that much time.

390
00:13:18,140 --> 00:13:20,570
- I only brought the best one.
- That's great.

391
00:13:20,700 --> 00:13:22,280
- Whose name will you use?
- So Min's.

392
00:13:22,280 --> 00:13:24,070
- So Min's name.
- My name is hard to do a poem with.

393
00:13:24,070 --> 00:13:25,440
- You should do one with her name.
- First line.

394
00:13:25,850 --> 00:13:27,810
I came here by myself.

395
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:30,210
- Second line.
- So Min, please help me a lot.

396
00:13:30,710 --> 00:13:31,850
Third line.

397
00:13:31,850 --> 00:13:33,050
When it comes to embarrassing acts,

398
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:34,620
we should do them together!

399
00:13:35,860 --> 00:13:38,490
(Raising her hands high)

400
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,420
(In fact, everyone did join
her embarrassing moment.)

401
00:13:42,420 --> 00:13:44,370
We can't even make this work.

402
00:13:44,920 --> 00:13:47,290
- Don't you get this?
- No, we get it.

403
00:13:47,290 --> 00:13:48,460
- My gosh.
- So Min.

404
00:13:48,460 --> 00:13:50,330
- She went to the restroom.
- She went to the restroom.

405
00:13:50,330 --> 00:13:51,740
- She wet her armpits.
- She looked in the mirror.

406
00:13:52,110 --> 00:13:54,170
- She did this with the water.
- She put water on her armpits

407
00:13:55,480 --> 00:13:56,800
- Come on.
- Right now...

408
00:13:57,670 --> 00:13:58,780
My gosh.

409
00:13:58,980 --> 00:14:00,040
So Min's armpits.

410
00:14:00,040 --> 00:14:02,180
- She brought the incident back.
- The water park.

411
00:14:02,180 --> 00:14:03,410
- She reminded us.
- It's not that.

412
00:14:03,410 --> 00:14:04,580
Am I that famous?

413
00:14:04,910 --> 00:14:06,260
Am I that famous?

414
00:14:06,260 --> 00:14:07,580
Hey, that meme went viral.

415
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:09,130
- By the way,
- This...

416
00:14:09,130 --> 00:14:10,860
- I...
- So Min and her armpits.

417
00:14:10,860 --> 00:14:12,900
I went there to splash water on me,

418
00:14:12,900 --> 00:14:14,500
But I was already sweating.

419
00:14:15,420 --> 00:14:17,600
- There's no need for water?
- You were already sweating?

420
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:19,330
You didn't have to tell us that.

421
00:14:19,500 --> 00:14:21,100
All right. Ha Na.

422
00:14:21,240 --> 00:14:24,110
- I'll choose Ha Na.
- Okay.

423
00:14:24,140 --> 00:14:25,830
- Ha Na.
- She's amazing.

424
00:14:25,830 --> 00:14:29,070
How could I not choose her?
I chose her for her enthusiasm.

425
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:30,880
- Are we going in order?
- Yes.

426
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:32,480
I'll choose So Min
who will publish a book soon.

427
00:14:32,540 --> 00:14:33,650
Ji Hyo!

428
00:14:33,750 --> 00:14:35,910
- I'll choose my doll.
- Kwang Soo.

429
00:14:35,910 --> 00:14:37,040
(Selection of Teams)

430
00:14:37,310 --> 00:14:39,810
We'll distribute the tool
to each team.

431
00:14:40,710 --> 00:14:43,130
- The pen is for the appraiser.
- The pen?

432
00:14:43,130 --> 00:14:44,320
- This doesn't suit me.
- Is that your role?

433
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:45,360
- Yes, that's my role.
- My gosh.

434
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:47,600
- That's yours, Jong Kook.
- Use the light on the pen.

435
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:48,960
You'll see what's written.

436
00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:54,400
(Scribbling something)

437
00:14:54,400 --> 00:14:56,060
- Shine it.
- Write it with the pen first.

438
00:14:58,010 --> 00:14:59,430
(Laughing)

439
00:14:59,430 --> 00:15:01,030
- She's driving me crazy.
- What is it?

440
00:15:01,030 --> 00:15:02,250
What?

441
00:15:03,250 --> 00:15:04,300
Why?

442
00:15:05,150 --> 00:15:06,350
"Se Chan."

443
00:15:06,670 --> 00:15:07,980
- She drew a heart and signed it.
- "From So Min."

444
00:15:07,980 --> 00:15:09,910
(Only the appraiser
can read the love letter.)

445
00:15:09,910 --> 00:15:12,210
- So Min got a good team today.
- Exactly.

446
00:15:12,210 --> 00:15:13,410
- Why do you keep...
- My gosh.

447
00:15:13,490 --> 00:15:16,180
- following me around lately?
- Right.

448
00:15:17,530 --> 00:15:19,900
(The mission tools are provided.)

449
00:15:19,950 --> 00:15:21,290
- What is that?
- What is it?

450
00:15:21,290 --> 00:15:22,790
- There are three cars.
- That's going to be really cold.

451
00:15:22,790 --> 00:15:24,900
- What is this?
- It'll be really cold.

452
00:15:24,900 --> 00:15:26,560
- Which one?
- I want to ride that one.

453
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:27,740
(A luxurious sedan
with the best ride quality)

454
00:15:27,740 --> 00:15:29,140
No, I don't want that one.
It'll be cold.

455
00:15:29,560 --> 00:15:30,870
It's a convertible.

456
00:15:30,930 --> 00:15:32,200
Gosh, it'll be freezing.

457
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:33,930
- In this weather?
- It will be so cold.

458
00:15:33,930 --> 00:15:35,780
But riding a convertible now...

459
00:15:35,780 --> 00:15:36,850
- It's too cold.
- doesn't sound good.

460
00:15:36,850 --> 00:15:38,440
- Isn't that a penalty?
- A convertible...

461
00:15:38,440 --> 00:15:40,570
I don't like it even when it's sunny
because of the micro-dust.

462
00:15:40,650 --> 00:15:41,850
I like convertibles.

463
00:15:42,040 --> 00:15:45,910
You don't know the address
of the mansion you need to rob.

464
00:15:46,020 --> 00:15:47,620
You need to complete missions...

465
00:15:47,620 --> 00:15:50,550
to obtain the address and passcode
of the mansion,

466
00:15:50,550 --> 00:15:52,400
locations of surveillance cameras,
and the patrol schedule.

467
00:15:53,230 --> 00:15:55,160
Arriving at the mansion quickly
will be advantageous.

468
00:15:55,420 --> 00:15:58,290
The mansion will open
from 3 p.m. to 5 p.m.

469
00:15:58,290 --> 00:15:59,290
(It will stay open
only for 2 hours.)

470
00:16:00,640 --> 00:16:03,330
You have three options
for transportation to get there.

471
00:16:03,330 --> 00:16:04,510
Team Ocean's will drive...

472
00:16:04,510 --> 00:16:06,110
- the luxurious sedan.
- Team Ocean's.

473
00:16:06,110 --> 00:16:07,480
Team Home Alone will drive
the van.

474
00:16:07,480 --> 00:16:08,570
Team Home Alone.

475
00:16:08,570 --> 00:16:11,410
Team Les Miserables will put on
a wig and ride the convertible.

476
00:16:11,410 --> 00:16:12,520
- These are the teams.
- Let's avoid that one.

477
00:16:12,520 --> 00:16:14,170
Don't we look like the thieves
in "Home Alone"?

478
00:16:14,170 --> 00:16:16,580
- It's "Home Alone."
- Right?

479
00:16:16,580 --> 00:16:19,620
It totally suits you.
The hat helps too.

480
00:16:19,620 --> 00:16:20,910
- Let's go for that one.
- It's on fire.

481
00:16:20,910 --> 00:16:22,820
(The hat and his facial expression
look exactly the same.)

482
00:16:22,820 --> 00:16:24,890
- Macaulay Culkin.
- You're wearing the same hat.

483
00:16:24,890 --> 00:16:26,450
- You have to scream like this.
- This?

484
00:16:26,900 --> 00:16:28,130
He has the same hat.

485
00:16:28,360 --> 00:16:32,640
Only 1 of the 3 silver trays
has cherries from Chile.

486
00:16:32,870 --> 00:16:35,510
The team that picks the tray
with the cherries from Chile wins.

487
00:16:35,740 --> 00:16:38,740
The winning team will assign
the cars to all of the teams.

488
00:16:38,740 --> 00:16:39,830
The winning team will decide.

489
00:16:39,830 --> 00:16:42,150
Hey, riding that car is a penalty.

490
00:16:42,150 --> 00:16:43,850
- I want to ride the sedan.
- I want this one.

491
00:16:43,880 --> 00:16:46,710
I don't care which car I get
as long as it's not the last one.

492
00:16:46,710 --> 00:16:48,890
Discuss among yourselves
to pick a tray.

493
00:16:48,990 --> 00:16:50,150
Ha Na, you should choose.

494
00:16:50,620 --> 00:16:52,160
When I observed Ha Na,

495
00:16:52,450 --> 00:16:54,160
I could tell she gets unlucky too.

496
00:16:54,410 --> 00:16:56,260
Let me feel the energy of cherries.

497
00:16:56,260 --> 00:16:57,450
(She makes a fuss
when she can't get the job done.)

498
00:16:57,450 --> 00:16:58,950
- She's enthusiastic.
- Indeed.

499
00:16:59,050 --> 00:17:00,420
She's enthusiastic.

500
00:17:00,420 --> 00:17:01,600
I need enough airtime for myself.

501
00:17:02,790 --> 00:17:04,870
- What is it? Did you decide?
- I have a good feeling about that.

502
00:17:04,870 --> 00:17:06,660
- Do it. Get whatever you want.
- Open it.

503
00:17:06,660 --> 00:17:08,240
- In 1, 2, 3.
- In 1, 2, 3.

504
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:09,930
(The cherries will be
on only one of the trays.)

505
00:17:09,930 --> 00:17:12,410
(What is on the tray Ha Na chose?)

506
00:17:12,410 --> 00:17:14,340
(Full of cherries)

507
00:17:14,770 --> 00:17:15,910
That was amazing.

508
00:17:15,970 --> 00:17:17,770
- How did you know that?
- That was amazing.

509
00:17:17,940 --> 00:17:19,470
You called it.

510
00:17:19,470 --> 00:17:20,820
(Ease your disappointment
with sweet cherries.)

511
00:17:20,820 --> 00:17:21,910
Try it.

512
00:17:22,790 --> 00:17:25,210
- Okay.
- Cherries are good in snowy winter.

513
00:17:25,210 --> 00:17:27,590
(Sweet and sour cherries
eaten in a warm room during winter)

514
00:17:27,590 --> 00:17:28,710
- These are good.
- Yes.

515
00:17:29,060 --> 00:17:30,220
These are great.

516
00:17:30,220 --> 00:17:31,560
(And...)

517
00:17:31,560 --> 00:17:33,900
- I like cherries.
- Me too.

518
00:17:33,900 --> 00:17:35,400
(Suk Jin is eating cherries
in a unique way.)

519
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:37,370
(Eating it in one go)

520
00:17:37,660 --> 00:17:39,800
I heard your teeth crack.
Are you okay?

521
00:17:40,490 --> 00:17:41,760
(Get your dental implants
with cherries.)

522
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:42,930
- I heard a crack.
- I think it hit your tooth.

523
00:17:42,930 --> 00:17:44,110
- No.
- What's wrong?

524
00:17:44,110 --> 00:17:45,460
You know what?

525
00:17:45,460 --> 00:17:46,880
Everything is going my way
this year.

526
00:17:47,040 --> 00:17:49,440
He uses up his luck
on useless things.

527
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:50,700
He uses it on the bottle flip.

528
00:17:50,700 --> 00:17:52,350
You're right. You have a boint.

529
00:17:52,550 --> 00:17:53,650
I have a "boint"?

530
00:17:53,650 --> 00:17:55,740
(You have a boint.)

531
00:17:55,820 --> 00:17:57,150
I have a "boint"?

532
00:17:57,390 --> 00:17:58,910
- "Boint"?
- "Boint"?

533
00:17:58,950 --> 00:18:00,480
He needs to "cherry" up, you know.

534
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:02,010
(He needs to "cherry" up, you know.)

535
00:18:02,010 --> 00:18:03,020
He needs to "cherry" up.

536
00:18:03,020 --> 00:18:05,090
(Suk Jin,
please cherry up this year.)

537
00:18:05,090 --> 00:18:06,560
- Can we start?
- This is fun.

538
00:18:06,630 --> 00:18:08,130
- Which team will get that car?
- You must decide.

539
00:18:08,130 --> 00:18:09,760
- You can choose however you want.
- Let us play rock-paper-scissors.

540
00:18:09,870 --> 00:18:11,660
To make it entertaining,
they should...

541
00:18:11,660 --> 00:18:12,960
- They're Team Les Miserables.
- He can drive.

542
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:14,140
So they are Team Les Miserables.

543
00:18:14,300 --> 00:18:16,760
- Even if we make them drive it...
- Jae Suk, they can be newlyweds.

544
00:18:17,410 --> 00:18:19,540
- Right.
- Jong Kook won't say a thing.

545
00:18:19,730 --> 00:18:23,080
Jong Kook can drive the car.
And they can sit in the back.

546
00:18:23,170 --> 00:18:25,000
- Right.
- That will be so fun.

547
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:28,770
- Take that off.
- I can't.

548
00:18:29,090 --> 00:18:30,440
- Take it off.
- I can't give it up.

549
00:18:30,650 --> 00:18:32,710
- The wig looks great on you.
- You look beautiful.

550
00:18:32,860 --> 00:18:34,010
- Take it off.
- I can't give it up.

551
00:18:34,250 --> 00:18:35,920
- Jae Suk won't even listen.
- We can change his mind.

552
00:18:35,920 --> 00:18:37,720
- Kwang Ja will take it.
- It's settled.

553
00:18:37,890 --> 00:18:39,420
- It's settled.
- Which team gets the convertible?

554
00:18:39,420 --> 00:18:40,920
We'll take the Maserati.

555
00:18:40,920 --> 00:18:42,100
I'd rather see Kwang Soo
with the wig than Jong Kook.

556
00:18:42,100 --> 00:18:43,490
- We'll have a comfortable ride.
- We'll take...

557
00:18:43,490 --> 00:18:46,490
I'll give you the address
of each spot.

558
00:18:46,800 --> 00:18:48,400
- Se Chan.
- Hello.

559
00:18:49,310 --> 00:18:51,910
- Honey, let's go.
- Okay.

560
00:18:51,910 --> 00:18:54,040
- What's Jong Kook's role? Our son?
- Yes.

561
00:18:54,040 --> 00:18:55,670
- My son.
- Son?

562
00:18:55,770 --> 00:18:56,910
My son.

563
00:18:56,910 --> 00:18:58,270
- I have a great son.
- You raised a nice son.

564
00:18:58,270 --> 00:18:59,580
- He's reliable.
- I gave birth to a great son.

565
00:18:59,710 --> 00:19:01,670
How did I give birth
to a handsome son with you?

566
00:19:01,940 --> 00:19:03,910
You have a great son.

567
00:19:03,910 --> 00:19:05,320
This is the mission card.

568
00:19:05,480 --> 00:19:06,660
There are three places.

569
00:19:07,590 --> 00:19:10,090
Even if we go to one of these,
we need to know the passcode.

570
00:19:10,090 --> 00:19:11,560
Then we should go here first.

571
00:19:11,830 --> 00:19:13,690
We need to know
the passcode first.

572
00:19:13,720 --> 00:19:16,920
Don't you think everyone will go...

573
00:19:16,920 --> 00:19:19,400
- to this spot?
- I'm not sure.

574
00:19:19,640 --> 00:19:21,370
It's snowing a lot today.

575
00:19:21,930 --> 00:19:23,540
This is pricking my head.

576
00:19:24,310 --> 00:19:26,430
- Darn it.
- It's so prickly.

577
00:19:26,430 --> 00:19:28,000
It's pricking my head.

578
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:29,940
It keeps going into my mouth.

579
00:19:29,940 --> 00:19:32,710
This is so irritating. It is!

580
00:19:32,710 --> 00:19:34,710
Let's turn on the heater.

581
00:19:34,710 --> 00:19:36,710
(Is this the heater?)

582
00:19:36,710 --> 00:19:39,120
- Where's the heater?
- You opened the trunk.

583
00:19:39,250 --> 00:19:40,710
You opened the trunk.

584
00:19:41,590 --> 00:19:43,250
How do I close it?

585
00:19:44,420 --> 00:19:45,990
Please close the trunk.

586
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:48,450
Let me punch in the address.

587
00:19:48,450 --> 00:19:51,900
- I'm on the wrong team.
- Hey, we just have to win.

588
00:19:51,900 --> 00:19:53,690
- Yongmun...
- Yangpyeong-gu.

589
00:19:53,690 --> 00:19:54,690
Everyone's staring at us.

590
00:19:54,690 --> 00:19:56,700
- I saw Yongmun just now.
- Really?

591
00:19:56,700 --> 00:19:57,910
(They're inserting the address.)

592
00:19:57,910 --> 00:19:59,230
You can't even use
the navigation properly.

593
00:19:59,230 --> 00:20:02,080
Then you try it. This isn't easy.

594
00:20:02,310 --> 00:20:04,670
- Hold on.
- Let's go there.

595
00:20:04,670 --> 00:20:06,970
- It's snowing a lot.
- Let's just go there.

596
00:20:07,650 --> 00:20:09,240
(They set out in a convertible,
wearing wigs while it's snowing.)

597
00:20:09,240 --> 00:20:10,240
Let's go.

598
00:20:11,050 --> 00:20:14,180
(They do look cool.)

599
00:20:14,180 --> 00:20:15,750
(I got a new car)

600
00:20:15,750 --> 00:20:17,160
Everyone's staring at us.

601
00:20:17,160 --> 00:20:19,190
- I'm so embarrassed.
- This is so embarrassing.

602
00:20:19,190 --> 00:20:20,990
My hair's a mess.

603
00:20:20,990 --> 00:20:22,490
- This wig is...
- Haha.

604
00:20:22,870 --> 00:20:24,490
It's so freezing!

605
00:20:24,490 --> 00:20:25,600
(It just happened to snow today.)

606
00:20:26,100 --> 00:20:27,430
This car is fast.

607
00:20:27,430 --> 00:20:28,730
- Haha.
- Haha.

608
00:20:28,870 --> 00:20:32,200
The faster you drive,
the messier Kwang Soo's hair gets!

609
00:20:32,380 --> 00:20:34,170
It's so fast, though.

610
00:20:34,380 --> 00:20:35,610
- Haha!
- I can't hear you.

611
00:20:35,610 --> 00:20:36,850
Okay, I'll slow down.

612
00:20:36,850 --> 00:20:38,150
- Are you okay?
- Yes.

613
00:20:38,150 --> 00:20:39,170
(Laughing)

614
00:20:39,170 --> 00:20:40,710
My goodness.

615
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:45,290
Let's eliminate
Jae Suk's team first.

616
00:20:45,290 --> 00:20:46,890
- Of course.
- Do you have the water gun?

617
00:20:46,890 --> 00:20:47,950
Okay!

618
00:20:48,660 --> 00:20:51,420
See? He can't hear me.
He's making no sense.

619
00:20:51,750 --> 00:20:53,420
He can't hear a thing.

620
00:20:53,830 --> 00:20:54,900
Let's not talk.

621
00:20:54,900 --> 00:20:55,900
I'm freezing.

622
00:20:55,900 --> 00:20:57,760
(Team Jong Kook is heading
to get the passcode and address.)

623
00:20:57,760 --> 00:21:00,570
Anyway, we should go
to the mansion and...

624
00:21:00,570 --> 00:21:02,700
Aren't we supposed to steal
as much as possible?

625
00:21:02,700 --> 00:21:03,700
You're right.

626
00:21:03,700 --> 00:21:06,610
This mission is perfect
for Kwang Soo.

627
00:21:06,610 --> 00:21:07,810
It suits Se Chan too.

628
00:21:07,810 --> 00:21:09,000
- Am I a petty thief?
- Yes.

629
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,200
I'm awful at stealing.
I get caught...

630
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:13,240
- because I can't lie.
- You stole my heart, didn't you?

631
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:15,820
I never did.

632
00:21:16,120 --> 00:21:18,350
- Are you sure you didn't offer it?
- She offered it?

633
00:21:18,350 --> 00:21:20,180
- I think you offered it.
- Is it out on the market?

634
00:21:20,180 --> 00:21:21,360
No.

635
00:21:21,890 --> 00:21:23,290
- We're here.
- Are we?

636
00:21:23,290 --> 00:21:25,020
- Are you sure? Let's go inside.
- Yes.

637
00:21:25,420 --> 00:21:26,860
Are we the only ones here?

638
00:21:27,020 --> 00:21:28,360
I think so.

639
00:21:28,690 --> 00:21:31,760
This would be a great place
to come and relax.

640
00:21:31,920 --> 00:21:33,400
Wouldn't it be great
to spend a night here?

641
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:35,400
- It'd be wonderful.
- It'd be great.

642
00:21:35,960 --> 00:21:37,160
- Let's come here again.
- Se Chan.

643
00:21:37,160 --> 00:21:38,160
Where?

644
00:21:38,160 --> 00:21:40,000
- Us three should come here.
- And spend the night?

645
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:44,650
Sure, as long as
he doesn't leave midway.

646
00:21:45,350 --> 00:21:46,580
- You better not leave.
- Hey.

647
00:21:46,580 --> 00:21:47,880
- You better not.
- Why would you say that?

648
00:21:47,880 --> 00:21:50,710
Just in case.
I don't want him to disappear.

649
00:21:50,710 --> 00:21:52,710
I'm done. This is hurting my pride.

650
00:21:52,710 --> 00:21:54,410
- Don't be ridiculous.
- I'm done.

651
00:21:54,410 --> 00:21:55,830
- I was only joking.
- Get out.

652
00:21:56,480 --> 00:21:58,890
- I think this is it.
- It's so pretty.

653
00:21:59,450 --> 00:22:02,960
(This is the mission spot
for the address and passcode.)

654
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:04,100
I think we'll be playing a game.

655
00:22:04,220 --> 00:22:06,760
If you win this mission,
you'll get the mansion's address...

656
00:22:06,760 --> 00:22:08,370
- and its passcode.
- Okay.

657
00:22:08,370 --> 00:22:09,930
The mission is called
Strawberry, St-raw-berry.

658
00:22:09,930 --> 00:22:11,140
- "Strawberry, St-raw-berry"?
- "Strawberry, St-raw-berry"?

659
00:22:11,140 --> 00:22:13,200
This is a popular game these days.

660
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:14,230
Really?

661
00:22:14,500 --> 00:22:15,580
(1 beat, you say strawberry.
2 beats, you say st-raw-berry.)

662
00:22:15,580 --> 00:22:16,610
<i>Strawberry</i>

663
00:22:16,610 --> 00:22:17,650
<i>St-raw-berry</i>

664
00:22:17,850 --> 00:22:19,150
<i>Strawberry, st-raw-berry</i>

665
00:22:19,150 --> 00:22:22,240
<i>- St-raw-berry, st-raw-berry
- St-raw-berry, st-raw-berry</i>

666
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:23,550
(1 beat, you say strawberry.
2 beats, you say st-raw-berry.)

667
00:22:23,550 --> 00:22:25,620
<i>- Strawberry
- St-raw-berry</i>

668
00:22:26,250 --> 00:22:27,290
<i>St-raw-berry</i>

669
00:22:27,290 --> 00:22:28,710
<i>St-raw-berry, st-raw-berry</i>

670
00:22:29,060 --> 00:22:33,520
<i>Strawberry, st-raw-berry</i>

671
00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:34,560
(If they reach the 8th beat,
they succeed.)

672
00:22:34,560 --> 00:22:36,420
- What is this?
- What is this?

673
00:22:36,420 --> 00:22:39,490
- What?

00:27:53,850 --> 00:27:55,240
Get ready, set, go.

844
00:27:55,240 --> 00:27:57,890
<i>- I like strawberries
- I like strawberries</i>

845
00:27:58,890 --> 00:27:59,910
<i>Strawberry</i>

846
00:28:00,010 --> 00:28:01,090
<i>St-raw-berry</i>

847
00:28:01,090 --> 00:28:02,250
<i>Strawberry, st-raw-berry</i>

848
00:28:02,250 --> 00:28:03,590
<i>St-raw-berry, st-raw-berry</i>

849
00:28:03,590 --> 00:28:06,330
<i>St-raw-berry, st-raw-berry,
strawberry</i>

850
00:28:06,330 --> 00:28:08,360
(He finally gets it right.)

851
00:28:08,360 --> 00:28:11,020
<i>St-raw-berry, st-raw-berry,
st-raw-berry</i>

852
00:28:11,020 --> 00:28:12,490
<i>St-raw-berry, st-raw-berry</i>

853
00:28:12,690 --> 00:28:13,930
<i>Strawberry, st-raw-berry</i>

854
00:28:13,930 --> 00:28:15,460
(It's the final 8th beat now.)

855
00:28:15,460 --> 00:28:18,500
(He just needs to say
st-raw-berry 4 times.)

856
00:28:18,500 --> 00:28:19,540
<i>Strawberry, st-raw-berry</i>

857
00:28:19,540 --> 00:28:22,230
<i>St-raw-berry, st-raw-berry,
st-raw-berry, st-raw-berry</i>

858
00:28:22,340 --> 00:28:23,550
We did it!

859
00:28:23,550 --> 00:28:25,940
<i>St-raw-berry, st-raw-berry,
st-raw-berry, st-raw-berry</i>

860
00:28:25,940 --> 00:28:28,770
(Team Jong Kook succeeds.)

861
00:28:28,770 --> 00:28:30,820
I think he mispronounced it.

862
00:28:30,820 --> 00:28:32,240
- No, he didn't.
- I think he did.

863
00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:33,660
- I think he mispronounced it.
- No, I didn't.

864
00:28:33,660 --> 00:28:35,590
- We're good.
- We're pretty good.

865
00:28:35,590 --> 00:28:37,020
- Good work.
- Great job.

866
00:28:37,250 --> 00:28:39,600
- I think he mispronounced it.
- Se Chan did it.

867
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:41,130
- I did it.
- I thought it'd never end.

868
00:28:41,130 --> 00:28:43,130
Since you've succeeded,
we'll give you the address...

869
00:28:43,130 --> 00:28:44,690
and the hint for the passcode.

870
00:28:44,690 --> 00:28:45,760
- Okay.
- Okay.

871
00:28:45,760 --> 00:28:47,690
You must read this outside.

872
00:28:47,690 --> 00:28:49,140
- All right.
- You must go outside first.

873
00:28:49,140 --> 00:28:50,410
- Let's pack.
- All right.

874
00:28:50,410 --> 00:28:52,200
<i>- St-raw-berry
- St-raw-berry</i>

875
00:28:52,200 --> 00:28:53,810
I have a feeling
they won't end soon.

876
00:28:53,810 --> 00:28:55,700
- You're wrong.
<i>- Strawberry, st-raw-berry</i>

877
00:28:55,810 --> 00:28:58,310
During the last part,
shout, "Lee Man Ki!"

878
00:28:58,650 --> 00:28:59,880
Be quiet.

879
00:28:59,880 --> 00:29:01,670
- Please do that.
- Shut it and leave.

880
00:29:01,670 --> 00:29:02,670
Here we go.

881
00:29:02,670 --> 00:29:03,890
I'm curious about the hint.

882
00:29:04,050 --> 00:29:05,050
Let's see.

883
00:29:05,050 --> 00:29:06,180
(They read the hint.)

884
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:08,320
The passcode is...

885
00:29:08,560 --> 00:29:10,950
- It's 200202.
- 200202.

886
00:29:11,130 --> 00:29:13,830
- 200 and 202.
- 200202. I get it.

887
00:29:13,830 --> 00:29:16,660
We should retrieve all the hints
and then head to the house, right?

888
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:17,720
Right.

889
00:29:18,330 --> 00:29:19,800
Haha, to the right.

890
00:29:19,800 --> 00:29:20,990
- The right?
- Yes, make a right.

891
00:29:20,990 --> 00:29:23,340
- Are you looking at the map?
- Make a right.

892
00:29:23,340 --> 00:29:25,110
- Are you sure?
- I'm sure.

893
00:29:25,500 --> 00:29:26,770
(Kwang Soo checks the map
on Ji Hyo's phone.)

894
00:29:26,770 --> 00:29:27,930
Gosh, it's freezing!

895
00:29:27,930 --> 00:29:29,340
- What's this?
- Let me see.

896
00:29:29,410 --> 00:29:30,610
I lowered the map and...

897
00:29:30,610 --> 00:29:31,910
(He's lost for words.)

898
00:29:31,910 --> 00:29:33,470
- What is it?
- The names of the months...

899
00:29:33,470 --> 00:29:35,150
- are in English.
- How is that important?

900
00:29:35,150 --> 00:29:36,410
(The names of the months
are in English.)

901
00:29:36,410 --> 00:29:37,850
(The screen is filled
with basic English words.)

902
00:29:37,850 --> 00:29:39,150
We need to check the map.

903
00:29:39,150 --> 00:29:40,480
- Have you been studying?
- Of course not.

904
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:42,510
- Are you studying English?
- You've been studying.

905
00:29:42,510 --> 00:29:45,220
This is for real.
There's no doubt about it.

906
00:29:45,220 --> 00:29:46,220
(This is for real.)

907
00:29:46,220 --> 00:29:47,630
- I just put them on the screen.
- You're trying hard.

908
00:29:47,630 --> 00:29:48,630
Good job.

909
00:29:48,630 --> 00:29:50,160
November and December...

910
00:29:50,420 --> 00:29:52,400
I'm always confused
by those two as well.

911
00:29:52,400 --> 00:29:54,430
It's nothing
to be embarrassed about.

912
00:29:54,430 --> 00:29:57,000
- Exactly. You're just studying.
- Haha, make a right over there.

913
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:59,500
- It's never too late to study.
- Of course.

914
00:29:59,540 --> 00:30:01,270
- Is this the place?
- I'm inspired, Ji Hyo.

915
00:30:01,610 --> 00:30:03,200
Stop talking about it!

916
00:30:03,940 --> 00:30:05,580
- Over here?
- On our way...

917
00:30:05,770 --> 00:30:07,150
Hold on. Make a left.

918
00:30:07,850 --> 00:30:08,940
What's the fourth month of the year?

919
00:30:10,710 --> 00:30:11,890
Se Chan, do you want some water?

920
00:30:11,890 --> 00:30:13,360
- Sounds good.
- Water?

921
00:30:14,060 --> 00:30:15,250
(Sweet and loving)

922
00:30:15,250 --> 00:30:16,330
Here you go.

923
00:30:17,630 --> 00:30:19,250
- Are you done?
- Thanks.

924
00:30:19,830 --> 00:30:21,400
- You have the lid.
- Right.

925
00:30:21,400 --> 00:30:23,160
It's nice to have
So Min take care of me.

926
00:30:23,220 --> 00:30:26,260
Just so you know,
it's better to have...

927
00:30:26,260 --> 00:30:27,960
a talkative wife or a girlfriend.

928
00:30:27,960 --> 00:30:29,430
- They respond well.
- You'll get bored.

929
00:30:29,430 --> 00:30:32,760
I like women who respond well
and laugh a lot.

930
00:30:33,230 --> 00:30:35,040
- Someone who responds well?
- Yes.

931
00:30:35,040 --> 00:30:36,970
No way! Really?

932
00:30:36,970 --> 00:30:39,310
(She gives him the top 3 responses.)

933
00:30:39,310 --> 00:30:42,050
(Yes, that's what
I'm talking about.)

934
00:30:42,050 --> 00:30:43,410
(Exploding with exclamations)

935
00:30:43,410 --> 00:30:45,090
Gosh, look at you
steering the wheel.

936
00:30:45,480 --> 00:30:46,750
That's so cool.

937
00:30:46,750 --> 00:30:49,060
I've never seen anyone
who does it with two hands.

938
00:30:49,060 --> 00:30:50,680
(He must be a beginner!)

939
00:30:51,480 --> 00:30:52,680
Gosh, look at his gums.

940
00:30:53,420 --> 00:30:54,450
Look.

941
00:30:54,630 --> 00:30:56,600
- His gums?
- No way.

942
00:30:56,600 --> 00:30:58,130
It'll be fun to go
on a trip with So Min.

943
00:30:58,130 --> 00:30:59,840
- Being talkative is better.
- Of course.

944
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:01,260
It's the best.

945
00:31:01,260 --> 00:31:02,260
I love it too.

946
00:31:02,260 --> 00:31:03,870
Don't you prefer someone
like Park Na Rae?

947
00:31:03,870 --> 00:31:05,840
Na Rae isn't exactly my type.

948
00:31:05,840 --> 00:31:06,840
What about Do Yeon?

949
00:31:06,840 --> 00:31:08,430
Yes, Do Yeon's amazing.

950
00:31:08,610 --> 00:31:10,670
Do Yeon's great.

951
00:31:10,670 --> 00:31:11,910
Is it me or Do Yeon?

952
00:31:11,910 --> 00:31:13,210
(The punch comes out of nowhere.)

953
00:31:13,410 --> 00:31:15,410
(He's suddenly forced
to choose his type.)

954
00:31:15,410 --> 00:31:18,910
(Is it the talkative So Min
or the funny Do Yeon?)

955
00:31:18,910 --> 00:31:21,680
Unbelievable. Of course, it's you.

956
00:31:21,680 --> 00:31:23,220
(Of course, it's you.)

957
00:31:23,220 --> 00:31:24,590
Must I even say it?

958
00:31:24,590 --> 00:31:26,220
(Jeon So Min is my type.)

959
00:31:26,220 --> 00:31:27,990
- Are you sure?
- Of course.

960
00:31:28,020 --> 00:31:29,450
This will air on TV, you know.

961
00:31:29,990 --> 00:31:31,400
She says it'll air on TV.

962
00:31:31,400 --> 00:31:33,490
- But...
- It'll be written in an article.

963
00:31:33,490 --> 00:31:35,430
- I'm sure of it.
- No way.

964
00:31:35,930 --> 00:31:37,910
I wish we'd get there soon.
Oh, we're here.

965
00:31:39,930 --> 00:31:41,530
- Are we? That was are.
- Right.

966
00:31:41,820 --> 00:31:46,000
(Team Jong Kook arrives at
the surveillance camera mission.)

967
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:47,470
(If they complete the mission,
they will be given a hint...)

968
00:31:47,470 --> 00:31:48,940
(regarding the locations
of the surveillance cameras.)

969
00:31:49,210 --> 00:31:51,600
- What's that?
- I'm nervous for some reason.

970
00:31:51,600 --> 00:31:54,540
I see the ropes. Are we supposed
to tie up or drag someone?

971
00:31:54,800 --> 00:31:55,900
Let me inform you of the rules.

972
00:31:55,900 --> 00:31:58,410
This is to find out the locations
of the surveillance cameras.

973
00:31:58,410 --> 00:31:59,950
Endure the Weight of the Paper.

974
00:31:59,950 --> 00:32:01,180
- The weight of the paper?
- Its weight?

975
00:32:03,310 --> 00:32:06,110
One person will have a piece
of paper laid on his or her head.

976
00:32:06,110 --> 00:32:08,190
You will then compete
in a four-legged race.

977
00:32:08,190 --> 00:32:11,760
Your goal is to place the paper
in the basket...

978
00:32:11,760 --> 00:32:12,760
within 60 seconds.

979
00:32:13,300 --> 00:32:15,060
(Those who complete the mission
will be given hints...)

980
00:32:15,060 --> 00:32:16,820
(regarding the locations
of the surveillance cameras.)

981
00:32:17,300 --> 00:32:19,890
What if we made his hair pointy...

982
00:32:19,890 --> 00:32:21,800
- and stick the paper there.
- Should I?

983
00:32:21,800 --> 00:32:23,010
No, you're adorable enough.

984
00:32:23,010 --> 00:32:24,660
- I'll flatten it then.
- He's cute.

985
00:32:24,660 --> 00:32:26,100
Let's make it flat
and put the paper on it.

986
00:32:26,100 --> 00:32:29,050
From what I can tell,
they're the couple in love.

987
00:32:29,050 --> 00:32:31,280
(From what I can tell,
they're the couple in love.)

988
00:32:31,280 --> 00:32:33,840
(They're the true couple
on this team.)

989
00:32:34,220 --> 00:32:35,550
No matter how I think about it...

990
00:32:35,550 --> 00:32:37,690
It's called bromance!

991
00:32:37,690 --> 00:32:39,310
(Glaring)

992
00:32:39,310 --> 00:32:40,760
They seem inseparable.

993
00:32:40,760 --> 00:32:42,430
- So Min, please don't sulk.
- He's right.

994
00:32:42,430 --> 00:32:43,620
- Come on.
- This way.

995
00:32:43,620 --> 00:32:45,620
Let's get on with the game.

996
00:32:45,620 --> 00:32:47,730
(The three in a love triangle
will give the game a shot.)

997
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:49,820
Wait, this is too easy.

998
00:32:49,820 --> 00:32:51,590
- Big strides.
- Don't turn your head.

999
00:32:51,770 --> 00:32:53,270
- Gosh.
- Why did you turn your head?

1000
00:32:53,270 --> 00:32:54,770
- I get it now.
- Good.

1001
00:32:54,770 --> 00:32:56,800
- Do something funny.
- We can do it.

1002
00:32:57,160 --> 00:32:58,600
- It wasn't even funny.
- Exactly.

1003
00:32:58,600 --> 00:32:59,900
It wasn't funny.
We should do better.

1004
00:32:59,900 --> 00:33:06,220
Are you failing on purpose
just to keep holding my hand?

1005
00:33:06,370 --> 00:33:07,640
(Is that why he's been failing?)

1006
00:33:07,640 --> 00:33:09,110
- Wait...
- It sounds like it.

1007
00:33:09,110 --> 00:33:10,380
- Is his palm sweaty?
- You see...

1008
00:33:10,380 --> 00:33:12,760
It is sweaty, and he's holding
my hand really tight.

1009
00:33:12,760 --> 00:33:13,790
I'm startled.

1010
00:33:13,790 --> 00:33:16,120
- I didn't lock fingers though.
- Stick your tummy out.

1011
00:33:16,120 --> 00:33:17,230
(Stick your tummy out.)

1012
00:33:17,230 --> 00:33:20,350
Jong Kook, must you do that?

1013
00:33:20,350 --> 00:33:23,620
(The two men start
acting like a couple again.)

1014
00:33:23,620 --> 00:33:25,500
(Frowning)

1015
00:33:25,500 --> 00:33:27,540
Something's definitely
going on between them.

1016
00:33:27,540 --> 00:33:29,040
(They lead a dangerous relationship
with him having a fake girlfriend.)

1017
00:33:29,040 --> 00:33:30,900
- So Min.
- Okay, we're ready.

1018
00:33:32,010 --> 00:33:35,100
(After numerous attempts,
they change the courier.)

1019
00:33:35,780 --> 00:33:37,400
- All right. Let's go.
- It's the magnet lady.

1020
00:33:37,400 --> 00:33:39,110
(The magnet lady returns.)

1021
00:33:39,110 --> 00:33:40,140
Gosh.

1022
00:33:40,140 --> 00:33:41,810
- Let's go.
- All right.

1023
00:33:41,810 --> 00:33:43,290
We can do this. It won't fly off.

1024
00:33:43,290 --> 00:33:45,290
- Let's go.
- This won't fall off me.

1025
00:33:45,290 --> 00:33:46,580
We can even walk at a fast pace
to make sure it won't fall off me.

1026
00:33:46,580 --> 00:33:47,760
- Sure.
- It won't come off.

1027
00:33:47,760 --> 00:33:48,790
It won't come off.

1028
00:33:48,790 --> 00:33:49,930
- She's the magnet lady!
- It won't come off.

1029
00:33:49,930 --> 00:33:52,000
Here comes the magnet lady.
Okay, we're almost there.

1030
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:53,820
Magnet lady, do your thing.

1031
00:33:53,820 --> 00:33:55,620
- Gently...
- Stick your head in there.

1032
00:33:56,930 --> 00:33:58,540
- We did it!
- Nice!

1033
00:33:59,090 --> 00:34:01,160
- Magnet lady.
- You succeeded in the mission.

1034
00:34:01,160 --> 00:34:02,740
- Hold on.
- Okay, we did it. It was fun.

1035
00:34:02,740 --> 00:34:04,270
- It's fine.
- Here you go. It's a hint.

1036
00:34:04,900 --> 00:34:07,180
- What's this?
- You may read it here.

1037
00:34:07,180 --> 00:34:08,210
(No one's around,
so you may read it here.)

1038
00:34:08,950 --> 00:34:11,280
In sub-basement level 1,
there are two near the stairs...

1039
00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:12,720
(Locations of Surveillance Cameras)

1040
00:34:12,720 --> 00:34:14,640
This doesn't seem easy.
We should go down...

1041
00:34:14,780 --> 00:34:16,310
That's a lot of cameras.

1042
00:34:16,310 --> 00:34:17,850
- There are three.
- Right.

1043
00:34:17,850 --> 00:34:18,910
Inside Room 1...

1044
00:34:18,910 --> 00:34:20,660
We need to turn
all three of them off first.

1045
00:34:20,660 --> 00:34:22,030
Where exactly are they?

1046
00:34:22,030 --> 00:34:23,280
- Right.
- There are a lot.

1047
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:24,780
(They have 5 seconds
to turn each of them off.)

1048
00:34:25,530 --> 00:34:26,890
Before 3 p.m.?

1049
00:34:27,620 --> 00:34:29,490
- We're running out of time.
- Oh, dear.

1050
00:34:29,600 --> 00:34:31,260
Unbelievable.

1051
00:34:31,740 --> 00:34:32,830
(What game will they play here?)

1052
00:34:33,100 --> 00:34:34,990
What are these for?

1053
00:34:36,200 --> 00:34:38,100
- Here are the rules.
- Sure.

1054
00:34:38,100 --> 00:34:39,180
What are we supposed to do?

1055
00:34:39,640 --> 00:34:42,680
The patrol schedule is
what you'll obtain if you succeed.

1056
00:34:42,680 --> 00:34:44,950
The game is called Clap Your Hands.

1057
00:34:45,010 --> 00:34:47,740
You will choose two members
to compete.

1058
00:34:47,740 --> 00:34:49,140
The two will put on...

1059
00:34:49,140 --> 00:34:50,720
tights with a glove attached to it
on their head...

1060
00:34:50,720 --> 00:34:53,620
and move toward each other
while making the tights swirl.

1061
00:34:53,620 --> 00:34:55,660
You have 100 seconds
to make the gloves...

1062
00:34:55,660 --> 00:34:57,720
clap each other three times.

1063
00:34:57,950 --> 00:35:00,200
(What hint will be provided
if they succeed?)

1064
00:35:00,200 --> 00:35:01,560
(They will be given
the patrol schedule...)

1065
00:35:01,560 --> 00:35:04,490
(which contains the time
and location for the patrol guards.)

1066
00:35:05,030 --> 00:35:08,370
(It will help them stay clear
of the patrol guards!)

1067
00:35:08,660 --> 00:35:09,660
Let's get going.

1068
00:35:09,660 --> 00:35:11,370
All right, here we go.

1069
00:35:11,830 --> 00:35:12,930
All right.

1070
00:35:13,810 --> 00:35:15,910
(Park Ha Na and Ji Suk Jin,)

1071
00:35:15,910 --> 00:35:18,850
(most likely)

1072
00:35:19,140 --> 00:35:20,580
Suk Jin, you should go down.

1073
00:35:21,240 --> 00:35:22,680
Go down. Get closer.

1074
00:35:23,220 --> 00:35:24,640
Wait, this is too low.

1075
00:35:25,580 --> 00:35:28,220
(Oh, no!)

1076
00:35:30,390 --> 00:35:33,060
(The tights give her a nose lift.)

1077
00:35:33,060 --> 00:35:35,490
You were wearing it too low.
It wasn't spinning well.

1078
00:35:35,890 --> 00:35:37,530
It was on your forehead.

1079
00:35:38,220 --> 00:35:40,990
(Laughing)

1080
00:35:40,990 --> 00:35:42,100
Ha Na.

1081
00:35:42,160 --> 00:35:43,470
(She gets a facelift too.)

1082
00:35:43,470 --> 00:35:44,470
Try to do better.

1083
00:35:44,470 --> 00:35:46,200
(Lifting)

1084
00:35:46,740 --> 00:35:48,010
You have to do better.

1085
00:35:48,010 --> 00:35:49,640
You don't have time for that.

1086
00:35:50,950 --> 00:35:53,510
(Dumbfounded)

1087
00:35:53,510 --> 00:35:54,740
Seriously.

1088
00:35:54,950 --> 00:35:56,580
What are you doing?

1089
00:35:56,580 --> 00:35:57,720
(Let's take a photo together.)

1090
00:35:57,720 --> 00:35:59,580
We don't have time for this.

1091
00:36:00,350 --> 00:36:03,450
(The most hilarious shot
of the first half of 2020)

1092
00:36:03,450 --> 00:36:04,680
I can't see anything.

1093
00:36:04,680 --> 00:36:06,160
Ha Na, move.
Suk Jin and I will play.

1094
00:36:07,160 --> 00:36:08,490
(As soon as they begin,)

1095
00:36:08,490 --> 00:36:10,330
(they manage to clap.)

1096
00:36:10,330 --> 00:36:11,700
- There you go.
- You clapped.

1097
00:36:12,530 --> 00:36:14,760
(The 2nd clap)

1098
00:36:14,760 --> 00:36:15,970
- Okay.
- Two.

1099
00:36:17,370 --> 00:36:19,280
(The 3rd clap)

1100
00:36:19,280 --> 00:36:20,740
- We're done.
- You clapped again.

1101
00:36:20,740 --> 00:36:22,700
(They accomplish the mission
so fast.)

1102
00:36:22,950 --> 00:36:24,310
Since you've completed the mission,

1103
00:36:24,310 --> 00:36:26,510
- I'll give you the patrol schedule.
- Thank you.

1104
00:36:27,410 --> 00:36:28,550
What's this?

1105
00:36:28,550 --> 00:36:29,680
(The patrol time and location
are revealed.)

1106
00:36:29,890 --> 00:36:31,010
(Patrol Schedule)

1107
00:36:31,010 --> 00:36:32,390
(Meeting Room 1 and 2,
Hacker's Room 2,)

1108
00:36:32,390 --> 00:36:33,580
(and Dining Room at 3:30 p.m.)

1109
00:36:33,580 --> 00:36:34,580
(Hacker's Room 1 and Reception Room
on the 1st floor,)

1110
00:36:34,580 --> 00:36:35,580
(Hacker's Room 3 and Meeting Room 3
on the 2nd floor at 4:30 p.m.)

1111
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:36,850
(1st Floor, 2nd Floor)

1112
00:36:36,850 --> 00:36:39,030
(In order not to be eliminated,)

1113
00:36:39,030 --> 00:36:41,220
(they shouldn't be seen
by the patrol guards.)

1114
00:36:41,220 --> 00:36:43,430
We've been doing well so far.

1115
00:36:43,470 --> 00:36:44,660
- Let's succeed at once.
- Okay.

1116
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:45,970
I'll go first.

1117
00:36:46,470 --> 00:36:47,640
You say, "st-raw-berry."

1118
00:36:47,640 --> 00:36:49,100
I say, "st-raw-berry, strawberry,"
right?

1119
00:36:49,470 --> 00:36:50,510
- Okay.
- Let's start.

1120
00:36:50,510 --> 00:36:52,740
<i>- I like strawberries
- I like strawberries</i>

1121
00:36:53,700 --> 00:36:54,810
<i>Strawberry</i>

1122
00:36:54,810 --> 00:36:56,010
<i>St-raw-berry</i>

1123
00:36:56,010 --> 00:36:57,350
<i>St-raw-berry, strawberry</i>

1124
00:36:57,350 --> 00:36:58,720
(She ignores the beat.)

1125
00:36:59,180 --> 00:37:01,080
(Loss for words)

1126
00:37:01,720 --> 00:37:03,390
You can continue until you succeed.

1127
00:37:03,490 --> 00:37:04,810
- The first one is "strawberry."
- Do you get it?

1128
00:37:04,890 --> 00:37:07,620
- The third one is...
<i>- St-raw-berry, st-raw-berry</i>

1129
00:37:07,620 --> 00:37:09,760
- You're pronouncing it wrong.
<i>- St-raw-berry</i>

1130
00:37:10,060 --> 00:37:11,580
It seems like...

1131
00:37:11,580 --> 00:37:13,350
Ji Hyo doesn't know the beat.
Do you?

1132
00:37:13,450 --> 00:37:16,060
She's smart, but she has
no sense of rhythm.

1133
00:37:16,120 --> 00:37:17,300
That's why.

1134
00:37:17,660 --> 00:37:18,870
- Please understand her.
<i>- Strawberry</i>

1135
00:37:19,140 --> 00:37:21,100
- No.
<i>- Strawberry, st-raw-berry</i>

1136
00:37:21,100 --> 00:37:22,200
Can we just give up?

1137
00:37:22,200 --> 00:37:24,260
- Hold on.
- We know the rules now.

1138
00:37:24,470 --> 00:37:26,100
It's not that she doesn't know.
Should we give it a try?

1139
00:37:26,100 --> 00:37:27,100
Let's try.

1140
00:37:27,200 --> 00:37:28,430
<i>Strawberry, st-raw-berry</i>

1141
00:37:30,200 --> 00:37:31,580
<i>Strawberry, st-raw-berry</i>

1142
00:37:31,580 --> 00:37:33,240
Say "strawberry"
when you clap your hands.

1143
00:37:33,240 --> 00:37:34,970
<i>- Strawberry, st-raw-berry
- St-raw-berry</i>

1144
00:37:35,050 --> 00:37:36,450
- Okay.
- Repeat after me.

1145
00:37:37,050 --> 00:37:42,280
<i>- Strawberry, st-raw-berry</i>
- Pronounce it properly.

1146
00:37:42,390 --> 00:37:43,560
Start saying, "st-raw-berry,"
when you point to the right.

1147
00:37:43,580 --> 00:37:45,430
<i>- Strawberry, st-raw-berry</i>
- There you go.

1148
00:37:45,430 --> 00:37:47,300
- Okay.
- Pronounce it right.

1149
00:37:47,300 --> 00:37:48,800
Let's give it a try.

1150
00:37:48,990 --> 00:37:50,160
If we fail, we can try again.

1151
00:37:50,220 --> 00:37:51,560
Ready, start.

1152
00:37:51,560 --> 00:37:53,700
<i>- I like strawberries
- I like strawberries</i>

1153
00:37:54,560 --> 00:37:56,510
<i>- Strawberry
- St-raw-berry</i>

1154
00:37:56,510 --> 00:37:57,510
(She misses the beat again.)

1155
00:37:57,810 --> 00:37:58,930
<i>St-raw-berry</i>

1156
00:37:59,030 --> 00:38:00,180
(Is this wrong?)

1157
00:38:00,180 --> 00:38:01,280
- I said it.
- You pronounced it wrong.

1158
00:38:01,280 --> 00:38:02,700
<i>- St-raw-berry</i>
- And the rhythm...

1159
00:38:02,700 --> 00:38:03,910
How should I explain it?

1160
00:38:03,970 --> 00:38:05,640
- It's hard to explain.
<i>- Strawberry</i>

1161
00:38:05,640 --> 00:38:06,780
<i>St-raw-berry</i>

1162
00:38:06,910 --> 00:38:08,120
<i>St-raw-berry</i>

1163
00:38:08,120 --> 00:38:10,240
- I get it now.
- Okay.

1164
00:38:10,240 --> 00:38:12,120
Switch seats first.

1165
00:38:12,310 --> 00:38:14,280
We'll start with the person
on the far right.

1166
00:38:14,280 --> 00:38:16,180
Ji Hyo and Haha,
please switch seats.

1167
00:38:17,080 --> 00:38:18,760
- You say...
- You'll go first.

1168
00:38:18,760 --> 00:38:19,830
Strawberry.

1169
00:38:19,830 --> 00:38:20,850
<i>Strawberry, st-raw-berry</i>

1170
00:38:20,850 --> 00:38:22,330
- Okay.
- Let's start.

1171
00:38:22,330 --> 00:38:24,470
<i>- I like strawberries
- I like strawberries</i>

1172
00:38:25,330 --> 00:38:26,430
<i>Strawberry</i>

1173
00:38:26,430 --> 00:38:27,560
<i>St-raw-berry</i>

1174
00:38:27,560 --> 00:38:28,700
<i>Strawberry, st-raw-berry</i>

1175
00:38:29,010 --> 00:38:30,140
Haha.

1176
00:38:31,370 --> 00:38:32,530
(Even Haha misses the beat.)

1177
00:38:32,530 --> 00:38:33,580
- What did I do?
- Hold on.

1178
00:38:33,580 --> 00:38:35,740
- I think it's the stool's fault.
- What's wrong?

1179
00:38:35,740 --> 00:38:37,280
It's the stool's fault.

1180
00:38:37,280 --> 00:38:39,310
- Did I do it wrong?
- You were doing so well.

1181
00:38:39,470 --> 00:38:40,550
Hold on.

1182
00:38:40,620 --> 00:38:42,450
- The first one was correct, right?
- I'll sit here.

1183
00:38:42,450 --> 00:38:44,490
Okay, let's try. This is strange.

1184
00:38:44,850 --> 00:38:46,620
- Is it "Strawberry, st-raw-berry"?
<i>- Strawberry, st-raw-berry</i>

1185
00:38:46,760 --> 00:38:48,120
Ready, start.

1186
00:38:48,120 --> 00:38:50,160
<i>- I like strawberries
- I like strawberries</i>

1187
00:38:51,060 --> 00:38:52,300
<i>Strawberry</i>

1188
00:38:52,300 --> 00:38:53,390
<i>St-raw-berry</i>

1189
00:38:53,390 --> 00:38:54,490
(He was late.)

1190
00:38:55,870 --> 00:38:57,430
(Shocked)

1191
00:38:57,430 --> 00:38:58,830
What's wrong with me?

1192
00:38:58,830 --> 00:39:00,490
(Embarrassed)

1193
00:39:01,300 --> 00:39:02,510
Do we have to do this?

1194
00:39:02,560 --> 00:39:04,100
- Do we have to get it?
- Isn't this correct?

1195
00:39:04,930 --> 00:39:06,510
<i>Strawberry, st-raw-berry</i>

1196
00:39:06,580 --> 00:39:08,510
Okay, I get it perfectly now.

1197
00:39:08,580 --> 00:39:11,140
We can't fall behind
because of this stupid game.

1198
00:39:12,310 --> 00:39:13,310
(From the captain to the hacker,
everything is a mess.)

1199
00:39:13,310 --> 00:39:14,550
- Okay.
- Let's go.

1200
00:39:14,740 --> 00:39:16,490
Ready, start.

1201
00:39:16,490 --> 00:39:18,720
<i>- I like strawberries
- I like strawberries</i>

1202
00:39:19,310 --> 00:39:20,990
<i>- Strawberry
- St-raw-berry</i>

1203
00:39:21,010 --> 00:39:22,390
(They finally got
the second one right.)

1204
00:39:22,390 --> 00:39:23,760
(What about Kwang Soo?)

1205
00:39:23,760 --> 00:39:25,720
<i>Strawberry, st-raw-berry</i>

1206
00:39:25,930 --> 00:39:26,930
<i>St-raw-berry, st-raw-berry</i>

1207
00:39:26,930 --> 00:39:28,430
(It's completely off the beat.)

1208
00:39:29,030 --> 00:39:30,200
(Seriously...)

1209
00:39:30,200 --> 00:39:31,300
It's difficult to start right away.

1210
00:39:31,330 --> 00:39:32,330
<i>Strawberry, st-raw-berry</i>

1211
00:39:32,330 --> 00:39:34,100
(Hacker Song has been struggling
for 20 minutes.)

1212
00:39:34,100 --> 00:39:35,200
And then right away...

1213
00:39:35,300 --> 00:39:37,240
I say, "St-raw-berry, st-raw-berry,"
when I pat my lap.

1214
00:39:37,310 --> 00:39:40,410
If I don't understand,
please explain.

1215
00:39:40,410 --> 00:39:41,700
How many times do I have to explain?

1216
00:39:41,700 --> 00:39:43,580
- You failed too.
<i>- Strawberry</i>

1217
00:39:43,580 --> 00:39:44,780
It's "Strawberry, st-raw-berry."

1218
00:39:44,780 --> 00:39:46,450
<i>- Strawberry, st-raw-berry
- Strawberry, st-raw-berry. Okay.</i>

1219
00:39:46,450 --> 00:39:47,740
<i>St-raw-berry, st-raw-berry</i>

1220
00:39:47,740 --> 00:39:50,680
- Ready, start.
- Let's slow down a bit.

1221
00:39:50,680 --> 00:39:52,580
- Ready, start.
- Ready, start.

1222
00:39:52,890 --> 00:39:56,680
<i>- I like strawberries

1223
00:39:57,830 --> 00:39:58,950

1224
00:39:58,950 --> 00:40:00,030
<i>St-raw-berry</i>

1225
00:40:00,030 --> 00:40:01,200
<i>Strawberry, st-raw-berry</i>

1226
00:40:01,200 --> 00:40:03,100
(It's Ji Hyo's turn again.)

1227
00:40:03,100 --> 00:40:04,800
(She needs to say,
"St-raw-berry, st-raw-berry.")

1228
00:40:04,800 --> 00:40:06,030
<i>St-raw-berry, St-raw-berry</i>

1229
00:40:06,030 --> 00:40:07,470

<i>St-raw-berry, St-raw-berry,
strawberry</i>

1231
00:40:10,030 --> 00:40:12,530
(Haha even gets
the fifth one right.)

1232
00:40:12,780 --> 00:40:14,100
<i>St-raw-berry, St-raw-berry</i>

1233
00:40:14,100 --> 00:40:15,200
<i>Strawberry, strawberry</i>

1234
00:40:15,200 --> 00:40:16,350
Hey!

1235
00:40:16,950 --> 00:40:19,280
<i>St-raw-berry, St-raw-berry,
strawberry, strawberry</i>

1236
00:40:19,370 --> 00:40:21,580
(You're the problem here!)

1237
00:40:22,310 --> 00:40:24,010
<i>- St-raw-berry, St-raw-berry
- St-raw-berry, St-raw-berry</i>

1238
00:40:24,010 --> 00:40:25,660
- Strawberry, st-raw-berry
- Strawberry, st-raw-berry

1239
00:40:25,890 --> 00:40:28,310
- Say "st-raw-berry" three times.
- She's right.

1240
00:40:28,310 --> 00:40:29,720
<i>- St-raw-berry, St-raw-berry
- St-raw-berry, St-raw-berry</i>

1241
00:40:29,720 --> 00:40:32,490
(The three of them
work it out together.)

1242
00:40:33,350 --> 00:40:34,490
No.

1243
00:40:34,490 --> 00:40:35,700
Okay.

1244
00:40:35,700 --> 00:40:36,830
Kwang Soo, switch seats with me.

1245
00:40:37,220 --> 00:40:39,760
Kwang Soo will do
the first one then.

1246
00:40:39,990 --> 00:40:41,390
We just have to repeat it
over and over again.

1247
00:40:42,140 --> 00:40:43,330
Ready, start.

1248
00:40:43,330 --> 00:40:44,510
Don't you feel embarrassed?

1249
00:40:44,910 --> 00:40:46,010
Don't you?

1250
00:40:46,810 --> 00:40:48,010
- Very much.
- Should we go out and come back in?

1251
00:40:48,970 --> 00:40:50,550
- Let's pretend we just got here.
- Should we...

1252
00:40:50,550 --> 00:40:51,870
pretend we just got here?

1253
00:40:51,870 --> 00:40:52,910
I'm so embarrassed.

1254
00:40:52,910 --> 00:40:54,140
We'll do it again.

1255
00:40:54,140 --> 00:40:55,370
Please edit out the first part.

1256
00:40:55,550 --> 00:40:56,990
We look so stupid.

1257
00:40:56,990 --> 00:40:58,310
- You can go out and come back in.
- Okay.

1258
00:40:58,720 --> 00:41:00,220
What's wrong with us?

1259
00:41:00,450 --> 00:41:02,930
We were doing so well.
Why is this so hard?

1260
00:41:02,930 --> 00:41:05,180
This is so embarrassing.
We're so bad.

1261
00:41:05,430 --> 00:41:06,620
We got here first.

1262
00:41:06,620 --> 00:41:07,950
- Is no one else here?
- Is no one else here?

1263
00:41:07,950 --> 00:41:09,700
(They hurry in.)

1264
00:41:09,800 --> 00:41:11,430
- We got here first.
- I smell coffee.

1265
00:41:11,430 --> 00:41:12,830
It smells so nice.

1266
00:41:12,830 --> 00:41:14,470
- I'll sit here.
- I'll sit here.

1267
00:41:14,470 --> 00:41:15,740
I don't know what game
we'll be playing.

1268
00:41:15,740 --> 00:41:16,740
(They all sit down where they want.)

1269
00:41:16,870 --> 00:41:18,810
- Let's get started right away.
- Okay.

1270
00:41:18,810 --> 00:41:21,640
We haven't even heard
about the rules yet.

1271
00:41:21,640 --> 00:41:23,010
- Let's just go with our gut.
- Let's go with our feelings.

1272
00:41:23,010 --> 00:41:24,310
- We're entertainers.
- Okay.

1273
00:41:24,310 --> 00:41:25,580
We've been doing so well today.

1274
00:41:25,580 --> 00:41:26,970
- We have 10 years of experience.
- Let's give it a try.

1275
00:41:26,970 --> 00:41:28,080
- I don't even know what game it is.
- Do you know the intro?

1276
00:41:28,080 --> 00:41:29,410
- Pardon?
- Do you know the intro?

1277
00:41:29,510 --> 00:41:31,050
Is it, "I like strawberries"?

1278
00:41:31,050 --> 00:41:32,720
- Not "st-raw-berries"?
- I have a feeling.

1279
00:41:32,720 --> 00:41:34,680
- Should we try it?
- It has a nice ring to it.

1280
00:41:34,680 --> 00:41:36,350
- Okay.
- It sounds so nice.

1281
00:41:36,350 --> 00:41:38,330
Let's try. 1, 2, start.

1282
00:41:38,330 --> 00:41:40,350
<i>- I like strawberries
- I like strawberries</i>

1283
00:41:41,100 --> 00:41:42,560

00:41:43,060 --> 00:41:44,160
<i>Strawberry, st-raw-berry</i>

1285
00:41:44,160 --> 00:41:45,660
(Ji Hyo misses the beat again.)

1286
00:41:45,660 --> 00:41:46,660
(Let's go out again.)

1287
00:41:46,660 --> 00:41:48,140
Let's pretend you arrive late.
I'll stay here.

1288
00:41:48,200 --> 00:41:49,260
You arrive late.

1289
00:41:49,260 --> 00:41:50,370
(1 minute later)

1290
00:41:51,030 --> 00:41:52,470
- What's this place?
- It looks cozy here.

1291
00:41:52,470 --> 00:41:53,580
Is no one else here?

1292
00:41:53,580 --> 00:41:54,780
It's nice and warm in here.

1293
00:41:54,780 --> 00:41:56,370
I see a xylophone.

1294
00:41:56,370 --> 00:41:57,910
- It must be something simple.
- This mission is...

1295

1296
00:41:59,970 --> 00:42:01,080

1299
00:42:04,390 --> 00:42:06,890
(They even get
the fourth one right.)

1300
00:42:07,280 --> 00:42:09,560
(Following Haha,
Ji Hyo gets it right too.)

1301
00:42:09,560 --> 00:42:11,720
<i>St-raw-berry, st-raw-berry,
st-raw berry, strawberry</i>

1302
00:42:11,720 --> 00:42:13,660
It's, "strawberry, st-raw-berry."

1303
00:42:13,720 --> 00:42:14,990
We were almost there.

1304
00:42:15,600 --> 00:42:17,300
- What's this place?
- Oh, my.

1305
00:42:17,470 --> 00:42:19,030
- We're...
- We're the first ones here.

1306
00:42:19,160 --> 00:42:21,100
(Let's slow down.)

1307
00:42:21,530 --> 00:42:22,600
<i>Strawberry</i>

1308
00:42:23,200 --> 00:42:24,560
You should have said
"st-raw-berry" twice.

1309
00:42:24,560 --> 00:42:26,330
- Was it my turn?
- You're on my right.

1310
00:42:26,330 --> 00:42:27,510
Was it? I'm sorry.

1311
00:42:27,510 --> 00:42:28,950
How could she forget that?

1312
00:42:29,010 --> 00:42:30,100
- It's scary.
- I'm...

1313
00:42:30,180 --> 00:42:33,010
- It must be a simple game.
- I think so.

1314
00:42:33,720 --> 00:42:35,740
- Let's slow down a bit.
- Let's slow down.

1315
00:42:35,740 --> 00:42:37,220
We're getting too carried away.

1316
00:42:37,220 --> 00:42:39,390
If we play it slowly,

1317
00:42:39,390 --> 00:42:40,760
can you speed it up afterward?

1318
00:42:41,660 --> 00:42:43,390
(This is it.)

1319
00:42:44,160 --> 00:42:46,700
(Slow)

1320
00:42:48,300 --> 00:42:50,200

1321
00:42:50,200 --> 00:42:52,700
(The beginning is no problem.)

1322
00:42:53,430 --> 00:42:56,470
(Once they slow down,
they manage it pretty well.)

1323
00:42:57,430 --> 00:42:59,240
(Ji Hyo gets the sixth one right.)

1324
00:43:00,200 --> 00:43:03,280
(After Haha, it's time for Kwang Soo
to finish the game.)

1325
00:43:03,280 --> 00:43:05,910
(Will Kwang Soo manage to say
"st-raw-berry" 4 times?)

1326
00:43:06,740 --> 00:43:09,240
<i>St-raw-berry, st-raw-berry

- We're done!

1328
00:43:10,450 --> 00:43:12,410
(They finally succeed.)

1329
00:43:13,560 --> 00:43:14,990
This was our first try.

1330
00:43:15,390 --> 00:43:16,580
We succeeded at once.

1331
00:43:17,660 --> 00:43:19,330
We're on fire today.

1332
00:43:19,950 --> 00:43:21,720
- We're geniuses.
- We didn't even know the rules,

1333
00:43:21,720 --> 00:43:22,890
- and we succeeded at once.
- We're so smart.

1334
00:43:23,100 --> 00:43:25,220
- We only just got here.
- Is this how you play it?

1335
00:43:25,930 --> 00:43:27,600
- Gosh, this is crazy.
- I'm so thrilled.

1336
00:43:27,600 --> 00:43:28,890
(The three brains win
the address and passcode.)

1337
00:43:28,890 --> 00:43:32,530
It's 3 p.m. The mansion is empty.

1338
00:43:32,830 --> 00:43:35,780
Anyway, we have to get there first
to steal expensive stuff.

1339
00:43:35,780 --> 00:43:36,850
- I know.
- Hey.

1340
00:43:36,850 --> 00:43:37,950
Let's hurry up.

1341
00:43:38,700 --> 00:43:40,220
We have to get there first
to steal good stuff.

1342
00:43:40,220 --> 00:43:42,450
The team that steals
good stuff first wins.

1343
00:43:43,490 --> 00:43:47,450
(It's just past 3 p.m.
Who will enter the mansion first?)

1344
00:43:48,660 --> 00:43:50,660
(Team Jae Suk arrives first.)

1345
00:43:50,660 --> 00:43:52,160
All right. Let's go.

1346
00:43:52,160 --> 00:43:53,330
Thank you.

1347
00:43:53,330 --> 00:43:54,830
We need to get there first
to get the good stuff.

1348
00:43:55,350 --> 00:43:57,560
(It seems like we've arrived first.)

1349
00:43:58,800 --> 00:43:59,970
Hey.

1350
00:44:00,060 --> 00:44:01,140
- 252...
- 252...

1351
00:44:02,160 --> 00:44:03,510
(The doors open.)

1352
00:44:03,510 --> 00:44:04,600
There you go.

1353
00:44:04,760 --> 00:44:08,430
(This is the secret mansion
that will be broken into today.)

1354
00:44:10,510 --> 00:44:12,350
(The thieves can steal things
from the mansion...)

1355
00:44:12,350 --> 00:44:14,120
(between 3 p.m. and 5 p.m.)

1356
00:44:14,120 --> 00:44:18,120
(They should steal valuables...)

1357
00:44:18,120 --> 00:44:21,080
(and move them to their tents.)

1358
00:44:21,080 --> 00:44:24,030
(The team
with the highest total value wins.)

1359
00:44:24,080 --> 00:44:27,720
(Name: Tear of Yondu,
Price: 30 million dollars)

1360
00:44:27,760 --> 00:44:31,060
(Bulletproof vest,
one-time protection from water guns)

1361
00:44:31,120 --> 00:44:34,370
(There is only one bulletproof vest,
and it's hidden.)

1362
00:44:34,560 --> 00:44:37,810
(If they get caught on surveillance
cameras for more than 5 seconds,)

1363
00:44:37,810 --> 00:44:39,930
(the patrol guards will arrive.)

1364
00:44:39,930 --> 00:44:41,830
(Once they get caught
by the patrol guards, they're out.)

1365
00:44:42,310 --> 00:44:44,950
Please fill your water gun
with the water provided.

1366
00:44:45,350 --> 00:44:47,870
Your water gun can eliminate
only one person.

1367
00:44:47,950 --> 00:44:50,720
Each item has a tag on it,

1368
00:44:50,780 --> 00:44:52,390
which will tell you its price.

1369
00:44:52,450 --> 00:44:53,580
Suk Jin, come here!

1370
00:44:54,450 --> 00:44:56,430
- Okay.
- We need an appraisal.

1371
00:44:56,950 --> 00:44:58,260
Guys, get out.

1372
00:44:59,100 --> 00:45:00,220
Can we go in?

1373
00:45:00,220 --> 00:45:01,600
Someone already broke in.
Let's go in.

1374
00:45:03,370 --> 00:45:05,260
Shouldn't we do something
about the surveillance cameras?

1375
00:45:06,370 --> 00:45:07,600
What's this?

1376
00:45:11,060 --> 00:45:12,470
I turned it off.

1377
00:45:12,470 --> 00:45:14,080
(A surveillance camera
gets turned off.)

1378
00:45:14,740 --> 00:45:17,100
(They begin to turn off
the surveillance cameras.)

1379
00:45:17,600 --> 00:45:19,140
(You are out if you are
on the camera for over 5 seconds.)

1380
00:45:19,140 --> 00:45:21,620
(Thus, it's easier if you turn off
the surveillance cameras.)

1381
00:45:21,620 --> 00:45:22,890
Okay. I turned it off.

1382
00:45:23,350 --> 00:45:24,810
Isn't this a surveillance camera?

1383
00:45:24,810 --> 00:45:26,220
- It is.
- Look for them carefully.

1384
00:45:26,220 --> 00:45:27,760
(Jae Suk's team finds
a surveillance camera by chance.)

1385
00:45:27,760 --> 00:45:29,930
- Turn it off.
- Don't get caught on camera.

1386
00:45:30,180 --> 00:45:31,220
Let's turn it off.

1387
00:45:31,220 --> 00:45:33,390
(He succeeds to turn it off
before 5 seconds pass.)

1388
00:45:33,390 --> 00:45:35,430
What? You turned it on just now.

1389
00:45:35,430 --> 00:45:37,470
I turned it off.
The light is at "Off."

1390
00:45:37,660 --> 00:45:39,700
Isn't this how you turn it off?

1391
00:45:40,160 --> 00:45:42,140
(He turns on
the surveillance camera.)

1392
00:45:42,140 --> 00:45:43,930
You turned it on.

1393
00:45:43,930 --> 00:45:45,060
For goodness' sake.

1394
00:45:45,060 --> 00:45:46,140
Oh, it should be at "Off."

1395
00:45:46,370 --> 00:45:48,410
- The light is at "Off."
- You don't know the basics.

1396
00:45:48,600 --> 00:45:50,450
There are
so many surveillance cameras.

1397
00:45:51,700 --> 00:45:53,580
- That's a surveillance camera.
- That's right.

1398
00:45:56,780 --> 00:45:57,950
(What?)

1399
00:45:57,950 --> 00:45:59,760
(He turns it back on.)

1400
00:46:00,060 --> 00:46:02,160
(He is proud because he thinks
he turned it off.)

1401
00:46:02,160 --> 00:46:04,160
Why is the light at "On"?

1402
00:46:04,160 --> 00:46:06,390
- Did I turn it off?
- The light should be at "Off."

1403
00:46:06,390 --> 00:46:07,560
I see.

1404
00:46:07,720 --> 00:46:09,160
I can't believe you.

1405
00:46:10,330 --> 00:46:12,200
What is wrong with you?

1406
00:46:13,060 --> 00:46:14,870
(Meanwhile, Se Chan)

1407
00:46:15,600 --> 00:46:16,970
How much is this? 3,000 dollars?

1408
00:46:17,310 --> 00:46:18,430
3,000 dollars.

1409
00:46:19,470 --> 00:46:21,510
(Let me steal it.)

1410
00:46:22,810 --> 00:46:24,470
(So Min was walking around
aimlessly.)

1411
00:46:24,470 --> 00:46:25,700
This could be expensive.

1412
00:46:25,910 --> 00:46:27,350
It could be a good bicycle.

1413
00:46:28,620 --> 00:46:29,640
All right.

1414
00:46:29,640 --> 00:46:30,950
(She rides the bicycle to the tent.)

1415
00:46:30,950 --> 00:46:31,950
Be careful.

1416
00:46:31,950 --> 00:46:33,760
(Jong Kook's team has stolen
5,000 dollars' worth of items.)

1417
00:46:34,010 --> 00:46:35,160
What is this?

1418
00:46:35,160 --> 00:46:36,620
(At that moment)

1419
00:46:37,220 --> 00:46:39,620
(A box with an R mark?)

1420
00:46:39,990 --> 00:46:41,660
(What's inside the box
Kwang Soo stumbled upon?)

1421
00:46:41,660 --> 00:46:42,760
It's a bulletproof vest.

1422
00:46:43,470 --> 00:46:45,970
(A bulletproof vest?)

1423
00:46:46,240 --> 00:46:48,640
(This is incredible!)

1424
00:46:49,310 --> 00:46:50,530
This is incredible.

1425
00:46:50,530 --> 00:46:52,530
(Kwang Soo can nullify
1 water gun attack.)

1426
00:46:52,830 --> 00:46:54,030
Where is Haha?

1427
00:46:54,030 --> 00:46:55,240
Haha? Your teammate.

1428
00:46:55,240 --> 00:46:56,700
- He is downstairs.
- Downstairs?

1429
00:46:56,700 --> 00:46:57,950
Why are you wearing a vest?

1430
00:46:57,950 --> 00:46:59,950
- Oh, it's a bulletproof vest.
- That's right.

1431
00:46:59,950 --> 00:47:01,580
Where did you get it?

1432
00:47:01,580 --> 00:47:03,950
What a coward! You were so scared
of being eliminated...

1433
00:47:04,050 --> 00:47:05,220
that you put it on right away.

1434
00:47:05,220 --> 00:47:07,510
- Go and sit in prison.
- Sure.

1435
00:47:08,490 --> 00:47:10,490
(Jae Suk finds something
on the 2nd floor.)

1436
00:47:10,490 --> 00:47:12,280
What? Why is there
a framed photo of me?

1437
00:47:13,350 --> 00:47:14,390
(A framed photo of Jae Suk is
in the living room.)

1438
00:47:14,390 --> 00:47:16,330
It's a framed photo of you.
I guess it has a price.

1439
00:47:16,330 --> 00:47:17,800
Let's check the price.

1440
00:47:17,800 --> 00:47:19,370
I don't have anything like this
at my own house.

1441
00:47:19,370 --> 00:47:21,030
Let's see how much Yoo Jae Suk is.

1442
00:47:21,660 --> 00:47:22,740
It's 10,000 dollars.

1443
00:47:22,740 --> 00:47:24,140
(Jae Suk's photo is
10,000 dollars.)

1444
00:47:24,430 --> 00:47:25,660
(That's pretty expensive.)

1445
00:47:25,660 --> 00:47:27,510
That's incredible.
I will move it to the tent.

1446
00:47:27,510 --> 00:47:29,030
(Here comes a 10,000-dollar item.)

1447
00:47:29,030 --> 00:47:30,950
I stole a 50,000-dollar item.

1448
00:47:30,950 --> 00:47:33,620
Let's check out the next room.
Let's see what's inside.

1449
00:47:33,780 --> 00:47:35,550
- How expensive is that?
- Why is there Yu San Seul's CD?

1450
00:47:35,550 --> 00:47:36,620
- How much is it?
- 200 dollars.

1451
00:47:36,620 --> 00:47:37,680
200 dollars. That's good.

1452
00:47:37,680 --> 00:47:38,950
Haha.

1453
00:47:39,620 --> 00:47:41,160
- That's my album!
- Haha.

1454
00:47:41,160 --> 00:47:44,930
(Haha's legendary debut album
no one has purchased, "The Gang")

1455
00:47:44,930 --> 00:47:48,700
- It's 15 dollars.
- For goodness' sake.

1456
00:47:49,160 --> 00:47:51,390
- 15 dollars.
- This album is really rare, okay?

1457
00:47:52,430 --> 00:47:53,530
This is...

1458
00:47:54,700 --> 00:47:57,010
Tear of Yondu?
Where is Tear of Yondu?

1459
00:47:57,240 --> 00:47:58,700
- What?
- So Min.

1460
00:47:58,700 --> 00:47:59,810
This is the hacker's room.

1461
00:48:00,100 --> 00:48:02,080
- What's the hacker's room?
- What?

1462
00:48:02,370 --> 00:48:04,050
This is the hacker's room.

1463
00:48:05,100 --> 00:48:06,350
(If 2 or more people stay
for over 5 minutes,)

1464
00:48:06,350 --> 00:48:07,550
(the alarm will sound
and the patrol will show up.)

1465
00:48:07,550 --> 00:48:10,780
(There are 3 hacker's rooms
in the mansion.)

1466
00:48:11,240 --> 00:48:13,890
(They might look like
an ordinary study,)

1467
00:48:13,890 --> 00:48:16,660
(but they contain...)

1468
00:48:17,220 --> 00:48:19,990
(a hint on Tear of Yondu.)

1469
00:48:20,220 --> 00:48:21,930
If 2 or more people stay
for over 5 minutes...

1470
00:48:21,930 --> 00:48:23,300
- I found it.
- So Min.

1471
00:48:24,220 --> 00:48:25,890
- No way.
- What is this room?

1472
00:48:25,970 --> 00:48:27,240
There are
no surveillance cameras, right?

1473
00:48:27,240 --> 00:48:28,640
(Do you want to know the location
of Tear of Yondu?)

1474
00:48:28,640 --> 00:48:31,010
- Haha, lock the door.
- Let's lock the door.

1475
00:48:31,160 --> 00:48:32,410
I am a hacker.

1476
00:48:32,510 --> 00:48:34,370
- This is a hacker's room.
- I am a hacker.

1477
00:48:35,100 --> 00:48:38,510
- If two or more people...
- What is this?

1478
00:48:38,510 --> 00:48:40,280
Se Chan, we need to do this.

1479
00:48:40,280 --> 00:48:41,680
We need to solve this

1480
00:48:41,680 --> 00:48:44,350
(There are a locked laptop
and a piece of paper with a code.)

1481
00:48:45,510 --> 00:48:46,780
It's a passcode.

1482
00:48:46,780 --> 00:48:48,350
(Will the passcode lead them
to Tear of Yondu?)

1483
00:48:49,560 --> 00:48:52,390
We will be fine
if we leave within five minutes.

1484
00:48:52,390 --> 00:48:53,490
Let's set a timer.

1485
00:48:53,600 --> 00:48:55,200
Alarm watch. Stopwatch.

1486
00:48:55,200 --> 00:48:56,330
"Alarm watch"?

1487
00:48:56,560 --> 00:48:58,220
Stopwatch. Five minutes.

1488
00:48:58,220 --> 00:48:59,830
(The clock is reset
if they leave the room.)

1489
00:49:00,930 --> 00:49:03,330
This is "I am."

1490
00:49:03,760 --> 00:49:05,160
(He uses
his limited English skills.)

1491
00:49:05,160 --> 00:49:06,810
I, M. A, I, M.

1492
00:49:07,640 --> 00:49:10,280
(His knowledge runs out.)

1493
00:49:10,450 --> 00:49:14,410
I don't get it.
What does "WXY" mean?

1494
00:49:15,140 --> 00:49:17,180
A, B, C, D, E, F, G,

1495
00:49:17,180 --> 00:49:20,180
H, I, J, K, L, M...

1496
00:49:20,180 --> 00:49:22,950
(She thinks for a while.)

1497
00:49:27,390 --> 00:49:29,620
(She begins to interrogate
the cameraman.)

1498
00:49:29,620 --> 00:49:31,620
What? What did you say?

1499
00:49:32,490 --> 00:49:34,200
You saw something, right?

1500
00:49:34,300 --> 00:49:36,010
Please tell me what you saw.

1501
00:49:36,560 --> 00:49:37,600
(Se Chan joins her.)

1502
00:49:37,600 --> 00:49:38,810
Can I come in?

1503
00:49:38,870 --> 00:49:41,370
If you come in, the patrol will come
after five minutes.

1504
00:49:41,370 --> 00:49:42,740
- I am going in.
- A, B, C, D...

1505
00:49:42,740 --> 00:49:45,080
I don't think you should fixate
on the passcode.

1506
00:49:45,080 --> 00:49:47,810
Leave before five minutes are up.
What time is it now? Come on.

1507
00:49:47,810 --> 00:49:48,970
Check the time.

1508
00:49:48,970 --> 00:49:50,620
Five minutes. I set the timer.

1509
00:49:50,810 --> 00:49:51,910
What is going on?

1510
00:49:52,010 --> 00:49:53,990
- What did you do?
- We didn't do it.

1511
00:49:53,990 --> 00:49:55,180
We didn't set the alarm off,
did we?

1512
00:49:55,810 --> 00:49:57,890
There are vowels and consonants.
What is going on?

1513
00:49:57,890 --> 00:49:59,390
Two or more people have stayed
in a hacker's room...

1514
00:49:59,390 --> 00:50:00,850
for over five minutes.

1515
00:50:00,930 --> 00:50:02,700
- What?
- The patrol is on its way.

1516
00:50:03,160 --> 00:50:05,390
(The patrol is dispatched
because of Ji Hyo and Haha.)

1517
00:50:05,390 --> 00:50:07,970
Do we need to hide?

1518
00:50:07,970 --> 00:50:09,830
(Is the patrol coming?)

1519
00:50:10,910 --> 00:50:13,140
(The patrol enters the mansion.)

1520
00:50:15,410 --> 00:50:16,410
I need to hide.

1521
00:50:16,410 --> 00:50:18,010
(The cowardly petty offenders
scatter to different places.)

1522
00:50:19,200 --> 00:50:22,780
(The siren made them scatter.)

1523
00:50:22,780 --> 00:50:25,120
(The patrol makes the rounds
on the 1st floor.)

1524
00:50:25,120 --> 00:50:27,580
(They pass by the room
in which Jae Suk is hiding.)

1525
00:50:27,720 --> 00:50:29,350
(Nervous)

1526
00:50:29,560 --> 00:50:32,560
(A few minutes pass.)

1527
00:50:33,220 --> 00:50:36,060
(The patrol leaves
without apprehending anyone.)

1528
00:50:36,390 --> 00:50:37,990
(I can go out now, right?)

1529
00:50:39,760 --> 00:50:41,640
Hey, So Min.

1530
00:50:42,300 --> 00:50:43,700
Jong Kook, I can't solve it.

1531
00:50:44,100 --> 00:50:45,640
These books must be here
for a reason.

1532
00:50:45,640 --> 00:50:49,470
Maybe the first letters
of the books make out this code.

1533
00:50:49,470 --> 00:50:51,200
- A...
- No.

1534
00:50:52,200 --> 00:50:53,640
(A deep sigh)

1535
00:50:53,640 --> 00:50:55,080
- That's right.
- You know,

1536
00:50:55,240 --> 00:50:56,720
I shouldn't have become a hacker.

1537
00:50:56,810 --> 00:50:58,080
This is so hard.

1538
00:50:58,280 --> 00:51:01,680
The other team's hacker is Ji Hyo,
so we can take our time.

1539
00:51:02,930 --> 00:51:05,030
I am not good at deciphering codes.

1540
00:51:07,560 --> 00:51:09,800
I, M, A.

1541
00:51:10,490 --> 00:51:12,660
- You know,
- What do you see?

1542
00:51:12,760 --> 00:51:14,140
these alphabets are in order.

1543
00:51:14,140 --> 00:51:16,870
U, V, W, X, Y.

1544
00:51:17,470 --> 00:51:19,200
- So...
- Turn them into numbers.

1545
00:51:19,640 --> 00:51:20,740
A is one.

1546
00:51:23,010 --> 00:51:24,280
(Hush!)

1547
00:51:24,280 --> 00:51:25,870
- For goodness' sake.
- What?

1548
00:51:25,870 --> 00:51:26,910
(You need to be more careful.)

1549
00:51:26,910 --> 00:51:28,680
- It's right.
- Do you want everyone to know?

1550
00:51:28,680 --> 00:51:31,010
- For goodness' sake.
- But I figured it out.

1551
00:51:31,010 --> 00:51:33,120
- What do you mean?
- A is one.

1552
00:51:33,850 --> 00:51:35,280
- Listen to me.
- What number is I?

1553
00:51:35,280 --> 00:51:37,060
A, B, C, D, E, F, G,

1554
00:51:37,060 --> 00:51:40,160
- H, I. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.
- That's not how you solve it.

1555
00:51:40,160 --> 00:51:41,200
Here.

1556
00:51:41,200 --> 00:51:42,660
Three letters...

1557
00:51:42,660 --> 00:51:45,970
would go into these question marks.

1558
00:51:45,970 --> 00:51:47,930
- That's right.
- Now,

1559
00:51:47,930 --> 00:51:49,640
the ends are A and Y.

1560
00:51:49,640 --> 00:51:52,700
I wrote out the alphabet
from A to Z.

1561
00:51:52,700 --> 00:51:54,740
These letters are symmetrical.

1562
00:51:54,740 --> 00:51:55,780
That's what I am talking about!

1563
00:51:55,780 --> 00:51:57,080
- These letters are symmetrical.
- Look.

1564
00:51:57,450 --> 00:51:58,780
W, X.

1565
00:51:58,780 --> 00:52:00,310
(If you divide all the letters
in half...)

1566
00:52:00,310 --> 00:52:02,470
- All of them are symmetrical.
- All of them are symmetrical.

1567
00:52:07,560 --> 00:52:08,990
All of them are symmetrical.

1568
00:52:08,990 --> 00:52:11,450
We need to find three letters
that are symmetrical.

1569
00:52:11,760 --> 00:52:12,950
We did it.

1570
00:52:12,950 --> 00:52:14,260
What should I do with this?

1571
00:52:14,390 --> 00:52:15,620
Symmetrical letters.

1572
00:52:15,620 --> 00:52:17,160
- B.
- B doesn't work.

1573
00:52:17,160 --> 00:52:18,220
- C.
- C doesn't work.

1574
00:52:18,470 --> 00:52:20,160
- H.
- H.

1575
00:52:20,160 --> 00:52:21,330
- Look.
- H.

1576
00:52:21,330 --> 00:52:22,740
- O.
- O works.

1577
00:52:22,740 --> 00:52:24,600
- Keep your voice down.
- T.

1578
00:52:24,600 --> 00:52:25,910
T works. T.

1579
00:52:25,910 --> 00:52:27,010
Hot. H, O, T.

1580
00:52:27,010 --> 00:52:28,200
(The answer is "Hot.")

1581
00:52:28,200 --> 00:52:29,640
- Hot.
- Hot.

1582
00:52:29,640 --> 00:52:30,850
Let's go outside.

1583
00:52:30,850 --> 00:52:31,910
(Jae Suk's team
deciphers the code.)

1584
00:52:31,910 --> 00:52:32,950
Leave it behind.

1585
00:52:32,950 --> 00:52:34,780
Jong Kook, I think I figured it out.

1586
00:52:34,780 --> 00:52:36,640
I need to find symmetrical letters.

1587
00:52:36,640 --> 00:52:38,850
- H.
- H, O, T.

1588
00:52:38,850 --> 00:52:40,160
- Three letters.
- Hot.

1589
00:52:40,160 --> 00:52:41,410
- Hot.
- Hot.

1590
00:52:41,410 --> 00:52:42,680
Let's try it.

1591
00:52:42,680 --> 00:52:43,830
H, O, T.

1592
00:52:51,590 --> 00:52:52,880
That's impossible.

1593
00:52:52,880 --> 00:52:54,050
("HOT" isn't the password
for the laptop.)

1594
00:52:54,050 --> 00:52:55,490
"H, O, T" doesn't work?

1595
00:52:55,630 --> 00:52:56,760
(How did this happen?)

1596
00:52:56,760 --> 00:52:58,990
But this is the hint.

1597
00:52:59,490 --> 00:53:01,760
Hey, Ha Na.

1598
00:53:01,930 --> 00:53:04,360
We got "H, O, T,"
but it isn't the password.

1599
00:53:04,860 --> 00:53:06,160
That means...

1600
00:53:06,430 --> 00:53:09,010
we need to find an object
that says "HOT."

1601
00:53:09,010 --> 00:53:10,240
You know what I mean, right?

1602
00:53:10,800 --> 00:53:15,950
(Is there an object that says "HOT"
in a hacker's room?)

1603
00:53:15,950 --> 00:53:17,950
This is an escape room.

1604
00:53:18,090 --> 00:53:19,510
Think of it as an escape room.

1605
00:53:22,220 --> 00:53:24,780
(Jae Suk spots something!)

1606
00:53:25,930 --> 00:53:27,090
"H, O, T".

1607
00:53:28,220 --> 00:53:30,900
(The object that says "HOT" is...)

1608
00:53:30,900 --> 00:53:34,070
(a water purifier!)

1609
00:53:34,070 --> 00:53:36,240
(He finds "HOT.")

1610
00:53:37,010 --> 00:53:38,840
(They study the water purifier.)

1611
00:53:38,840 --> 00:53:40,910
Should we take off the sticker?

1612
00:53:42,180 --> 00:53:43,550
I'll close the door.

1613
00:53:44,910 --> 00:53:46,740
(He secures the room.)

1614
00:53:47,650 --> 00:53:50,490
(When they take off
the "HOT" sticker,)

1615
00:53:50,490 --> 00:53:53,240
(they find something written.)

1616
00:53:55,050 --> 00:53:56,880
(Sand went into my ear,
so I went to the hospital.)

1617
00:53:56,880 --> 00:53:59,180
"Ear, sand, meat, and mouth."
What do they mean?

1618
00:53:59,530 --> 00:54:02,530
- They are in blue.
- Let's see.

1619
00:54:02,660 --> 00:54:05,220
- What could it be?
- "Sand went into my ear,"

1620
00:54:05,300 --> 00:54:07,300
- Ear.
- "so I went to the hospital."

1621
00:54:08,400 --> 00:54:09,740
(Why are four words
written in blue?)

1622
00:54:09,740 --> 00:54:11,530
Haha's location is revealed.

1623
00:54:11,530 --> 00:54:12,760
Running away will be of no use.

1624
00:54:12,760 --> 00:54:15,130
Police special forces have been
dispatched.

1625
00:54:15,130 --> 00:54:17,180
Haha's location is revealed.

1626
00:54:17,180 --> 00:54:18,380
Running away will be of no use.

1627
00:54:18,380 --> 00:54:21,680
Police special forces have been
dispatched to arrest him.

1628
00:54:22,570 --> 00:54:24,410
- Haha?
- Hurry and come out.

1629
00:54:24,590 --> 00:54:26,450
Running away won't be any use.

1630
00:54:26,450 --> 00:54:28,860
If his position is revealed,

1631
00:54:28,860 --> 00:54:30,530
doesn't it mean that he's caught
on a surveillance camera?

1632
00:54:30,550 --> 00:54:31,720
Is that what it means?

1633
00:54:32,050 --> 00:54:34,760
Is it because he was caught
on surveillance for a long time?

1634
00:54:35,050 --> 00:54:36,760
- Don't you think so?
- With the water gun?

1635
00:54:36,760 --> 00:54:38,490
He got caught
on the surveillance camera.

1636
00:54:39,030 --> 00:54:41,930
He's such a fool.
Why did he get caught?

1637
00:54:42,900 --> 00:54:45,470
(Haha is arrested.)

1638
00:54:45,470 --> 00:54:47,300
(Haha is out.)

1639
00:54:47,930 --> 00:54:49,840
Shouldn't he leave
the water gun with us?

1640
00:54:49,970 --> 00:54:51,680
- He should hand it to us.
- Right?

1641
00:54:52,300 --> 00:54:53,780
- That's true.
- Kwang Soo.

1642
00:54:53,780 --> 00:54:56,180
Can you solve it? I have no idea.

1643
00:54:56,180 --> 00:54:58,090
I can't stay here
longer than five minutes.

1644
00:54:58,380 --> 00:54:59,380
What's the hint?

1645
00:54:59,380 --> 00:55:00,720
(Unlike Ji Hyo
who didn't get "HOT"...)

1646
00:55:00,950 --> 00:55:02,110
"Sand went into my ear."

1647
00:55:02,110 --> 00:55:04,050
(Jae Suk and Ha Na are working
on step 2.)

1648
00:55:04,050 --> 00:55:05,550
Ear, sand, meat, and mouth.

1649
00:55:05,680 --> 00:55:07,550
(At that time)

1650
00:55:08,130 --> 00:55:11,570
(They hear the cuckoo sound.)

1651
00:55:11,570 --> 00:55:14,160
(They obtain the patrol schedule
after clearing the mission.)

1652
00:55:14,160 --> 00:55:17,070
(The cuckoo sound indicates
the start of the patrol.)

1653
00:55:17,570 --> 00:55:19,110
(Patrol schedule)

1654
00:55:19,110 --> 00:55:21,200
(Patrol location at 3:30 p.m.,
Meeting Room 1 and 2...)

1655
00:55:21,840 --> 00:55:24,570
(First patrol starts at 3:30 p.m.)

1656
00:55:25,240 --> 00:55:27,840
Gosh, they're coming in.

1657
00:55:27,840 --> 00:55:30,490
(Suk Jin runs away
to where there is no patrol.)

1658
00:55:30,490 --> 00:55:34,160
(Without knowing, Jong Kook hides
based on others' behavior.)

1659
00:55:34,660 --> 00:55:36,110
(They must hide
before the security finds them.)

1660
00:55:36,110 --> 00:55:37,930
Where should I hide?

1661
00:55:38,050 --> 00:55:39,130
(They move in order.)

1662
00:55:39,130 --> 00:55:40,220
Hide here.

1663
00:55:40,860 --> 00:55:43,260
(Each member hides.)

1664
00:55:44,260 --> 00:55:48,090
(Security starts to patrol
assigned locations.)

1665
00:55:48,090 --> 00:55:50,470
(He gets nervous
by the sound of footsteps.)

1666
00:55:50,470 --> 00:55:52,760
(They shouldn't patrol this room.)

1667
00:55:53,110 --> 00:55:58,300
(The security search
assigned locations in order.)

1668
00:55:59,470 --> 00:56:01,950
(They move to the next room.)

1669
00:56:04,720 --> 00:56:05,720
Se Chan.

1670
00:56:06,240 --> 00:56:09,550
Did you see security
during the patrol time?

1671
00:56:10,550 --> 00:56:12,720
(Of course not. I was also hiding.)

1672
00:56:12,720 --> 00:56:13,760
No.

1673
00:56:14,160 --> 00:56:15,160
(He sighs.)

1674
00:56:15,160 --> 00:56:16,160
Why?

1675
00:56:16,760 --> 00:56:18,820
Is someone on a mission...

1676
00:56:18,820 --> 00:56:20,200
after making us hide?

1677
00:56:21,530 --> 00:56:24,410
(Is someone doing something
in secret?)

1678
00:56:24,410 --> 00:56:25,860
Really?

1679
00:56:26,300 --> 00:56:30,150
It might be true
because I didn't see any security.

1680
00:56:30,300 --> 00:56:31,880
Do you see any security guards?

1681
00:56:32,150 --> 00:56:33,150
You don't, do you?

1682
00:56:33,470 --> 00:56:36,150
Someone is secretly on a mission
right now.

1683
00:56:36,320 --> 00:56:38,740
(The room where Suk Jin
and Se Chan are hiding)

1684
00:56:39,910 --> 00:56:40,990
They're here.

1685
00:56:41,010 --> 00:56:42,720
- Security?
- Policemen.

1686
00:56:43,160 --> 00:56:44,530
- Policemen?
- Yes.

1687
00:56:44,530 --> 00:56:46,660
- You're lying.
- They're here.

1688
00:56:47,160 --> 00:56:49,130
Go outside and look.

1689
00:56:49,530 --> 00:56:52,070
They're here indeed.
They are policemen.

1690
00:56:52,630 --> 00:56:53,860
(He can't check
in case he gets caught.)

1691
00:56:53,860 --> 00:56:55,240
I don't want to get eliminated.

1692
00:56:56,300 --> 00:56:58,360
(First patrol is over.)

1693
00:56:59,010 --> 00:57:00,070
Let's go.

1694
00:57:00,070 --> 00:57:02,930
(After checking
that the patrol is over,)

1695
00:57:02,930 --> 00:57:07,320
(everyone goes back
to their own hacker's room.)

1696
00:57:07,320 --> 00:57:10,550
When the security is on patrol,

1697
00:57:10,590 --> 00:57:12,450
all of us hide.

1698
00:57:12,450 --> 00:57:14,160
When we hide,

1699
00:57:14,160 --> 00:57:16,610
what if the spy does something?

1700
00:57:16,760 --> 00:57:18,260
Suk Jin said the same thing.

1701
00:57:18,260 --> 00:57:19,660
If you think about it... Really?

1702
00:57:19,660 --> 00:57:21,200
It's strange that we hide.

1703
00:57:21,200 --> 00:57:23,160
Hiding is too easy.

1704
00:57:23,200 --> 00:57:25,760
Suk Jin, doesn't something
feel strange?

1705
00:57:25,760 --> 00:57:27,630
- What?
- Jong Kook said exactly...

1706
00:57:27,630 --> 00:57:28,840
what you said before.

1707
00:57:28,840 --> 00:57:29,900
- Really?
- Yes.

1708
00:57:29,900 --> 00:57:31,910
That's why I asked
whether you saw the security.

1709
00:57:31,910 --> 00:57:33,260
I did.

1710
00:57:33,260 --> 00:57:35,110
- I saw them.
- Isn't someone on the move?

1711
00:57:35,110 --> 00:57:38,680
When we hide, everyone hides,
and no one does anything.

1712
00:57:38,680 --> 00:57:41,010
What if there's a spy
who goes around...

1713
00:57:41,010 --> 00:57:42,680
with the security?

1714
00:57:42,680 --> 00:57:44,320
- All we have to do is hide.
- Right.

1715
00:57:44,320 --> 00:57:45,450
Isn't it too easy?

1716
00:57:45,450 --> 00:57:47,720
I was hiding,
and the security saw me...

1717
00:57:47,720 --> 00:57:49,010
All right, be quiet.

1718
00:57:49,010 --> 00:57:50,090
What?

1719
00:57:50,090 --> 00:57:51,280
(All right, be quiet.)

1720
00:57:51,280 --> 00:57:53,950
(No one asked for your story.)

1721
00:57:53,950 --> 00:57:56,050
- Listen.
- But this is...

1722
00:57:56,160 --> 00:57:58,090
- It's not that important.
- If I don't talk about it...

1723
00:57:58,090 --> 00:58:00,070
- Was it important?
- It was very important.

1724
00:58:00,070 --> 00:58:01,070
It's very strange.

1725
00:58:01,070 --> 00:58:03,860
We should figure it out to solve it.

1726
00:58:03,860 --> 00:58:06,010
- So Min, let's go in.
- So Min.

1727
00:58:06,010 --> 00:58:07,240
We have to solve it.

1728
00:58:07,300 --> 00:58:09,840
- Don't go in.
- What? You go in first.

1729
00:58:09,840 --> 00:58:12,010
Come in when I set the timer.

1730
00:58:12,200 --> 00:58:13,280
I'm jealous of you.

1731
00:58:13,680 --> 00:58:15,050
Ji Hyo is the hacker on my team.

1732
00:58:15,050 --> 00:58:16,070
(He's jealous.)

1733
00:58:16,070 --> 00:58:18,380
- That's why I said that it's okay.
- It started.

1734
00:58:18,380 --> 00:58:20,510
We can take our time.
It's Ji Hyo on that team.

1735
00:58:21,380 --> 00:58:23,780
She's writing ABCD on repeat.
She's driving me crazy.

1736
00:58:23,930 --> 00:58:26,220
I thought that she was calling
the spirits.

1737
00:58:26,450 --> 00:58:28,090
X, Y.

1738
00:58:28,090 --> 00:58:29,200
(Please let me know the password.)

1739
00:58:29,200 --> 00:58:30,220
Why doesn't it work?

1740
00:58:30,860 --> 00:58:33,090
(She can't figure it out.)

1741
00:58:34,840 --> 00:58:36,470
- Here's what I think.
- There's something.

1742
00:58:36,470 --> 00:58:38,760
The owner of the mansion
or someone is up to something.

1743
00:58:38,760 --> 00:58:40,970
Isn't it strange that
there's a photo of Jae Suk?

1744
00:58:40,970 --> 00:58:43,380
It's strange that Jae Suk's
photo is in this house.

1745
00:58:43,380 --> 00:58:45,180
- Think about it.
- Also, the price is...

1746
00:58:45,180 --> 00:58:46,780
- It's 10,000 dollars.
- so expensive.

1747
00:58:46,780 --> 00:58:49,280
I wasn't going to say this,

1748
00:58:49,280 --> 00:58:53,050
but Haha's "The Gang" CD was
1.5 dollars, so I put it back down.

1749
00:58:53,760 --> 00:58:55,760
How can it only cost 1.5 dollars?

1750
00:58:55,760 --> 00:58:57,530
- I think it's Jae Suk's house.
- It's strange.

1751
00:58:57,530 --> 00:58:59,260
- Isn't it his house?
- Isn't this Jae Suk's house?

1752
00:58:59,260 --> 00:59:00,260
- Yes.
- This house?

1753
00:59:00,260 --> 00:59:02,530
He also interrupted you
a moment ago.

1754
00:59:02,760 --> 00:59:04,470
Hey, I think it's right.

1755
00:59:04,470 --> 00:59:05,900
That's why his photo is pricey.

1756
00:59:05,900 --> 00:59:08,090
- That's what I'm saying.
- Get out and go back inside.

1757
00:59:08,660 --> 00:59:10,090
- Right? It's strange.
- Yes.

1758
00:59:10,090 --> 00:59:11,410
I think this is Jae Suk's house.

1759
00:59:11,470 --> 00:59:13,740
(Se Chan is looking
for something to steal.)

1760
00:59:14,110 --> 00:59:15,130
What's this?

1761
00:59:15,130 --> 00:59:16,130
(He finds something.)

1762
00:59:17,340 --> 00:59:19,970
(He finds a safe by chance.)

1763
00:59:21,070 --> 00:59:24,180
(However...)

1764
00:59:26,410 --> 00:59:29,380
(Why is the siren ringing
all of a sudden?)

1765
00:59:29,380 --> 00:59:30,380
What's going on?

1766
00:59:30,550 --> 00:59:32,720
Yang Se Chan has been caught
on surveillance cameras.

1767
00:59:32,990 --> 00:59:34,160
Se Chan is out.

1768
00:59:34,160 --> 00:59:35,820
(Yang Se Chan is caught
on surveillance cameras.)

1769
00:59:36,900 --> 00:59:38,430
This is where
the surveillance camera was.

1770
00:59:40,070 --> 00:59:41,470
Why is that on?

1771
00:59:41,470 --> 00:59:43,200
(Surveillance camera is on.)

1772
00:59:43,660 --> 00:59:47,470
(Who turned it on?)

1773
00:59:48,110 --> 00:59:52,010
(Jae Suk definitely turned it off
a while ago.)

1774
00:59:52,010 --> 00:59:58,240
(Someone turned the surveillance
camera back on.)

1775
00:59:59,450 --> 01:00:01,910
Yang Se Chan has been caught
on surveillance cameras.

1776
01:00:01,910 --> 01:00:03,110
Se Chan is out.

1777
01:00:04,260 --> 01:00:05,660
That fool.

1778
01:00:05,660 --> 01:00:06,660
(Gosh, what a fool.)

1779
01:00:06,660 --> 01:00:09,950
Why did he get caught?
Where did it happen?

1780
01:00:10,260 --> 01:00:12,400
Did he go to the restroom?

1781
01:00:13,070 --> 01:00:14,860
- Se Chan is out.
- He got caught on camera.

1782
01:00:14,860 --> 01:00:17,200
I don't know. I don't think so.

1783
01:00:17,200 --> 01:00:18,300
(The more confusing it gets)

1784
01:00:18,760 --> 01:00:20,530
Who are you today?

1785
01:00:20,780 --> 01:00:21,840
- Me?
- Yes.

1786
01:00:21,840 --> 01:00:23,010
- What about me?
- What...

1787
01:00:23,010 --> 01:00:25,200
- You're very suspicious.
- Why me?

1788
01:00:25,200 --> 01:00:26,680
(However, there is no evidence.)

1789
01:00:26,680 --> 01:00:28,410
We have to be careful
of the surveillance cameras.

1790
01:00:28,410 --> 01:00:29,410
(Sand went in my ear...)

1791
01:00:29,410 --> 01:00:32,550
(Jae Suk is concentrating
on figuring out the password.)

1792
01:00:32,950 --> 01:00:34,550
(How are they related?)

1793
01:00:34,550 --> 01:00:36,010
(Staring)

1794
01:00:36,990 --> 01:00:40,760
(What is that number lock?)

1795
01:00:42,300 --> 01:00:45,260
(Sand went in my ear,
so I went to the hospital.)

1796
01:00:45,260 --> 01:00:46,360
Ha Na.

1797
01:00:46,360 --> 01:00:47,740
(Come here, Ha Na.)

1798
01:00:47,740 --> 01:00:50,530
(Did Jae Suk notice something?)

1799
01:00:52,010 --> 01:00:55,780
Ear, meat, mouth.

1800
01:00:56,280 --> 01:00:58,300
- What's this?
- Chinese characters.

1801
01:00:58,300 --> 01:01:00,950
(He finds numbers
with Chinese characters.)

1802
01:01:02,070 --> 01:01:03,990
(Ear, sand, meat, and mouth)

1803
01:01:03,990 --> 01:01:05,090
Chinese characters.

1804
01:01:05,090 --> 01:01:06,550
(2, 4, 6, 9)

1805
01:01:07,220 --> 01:01:09,910
(Team Captain Jae Suk figures out
the password.)

1806
01:01:10,380 --> 01:01:12,160
- This is it.
- I'll try.

1807
01:01:12,160 --> 01:01:13,860
Is it 2 and 4?

1808
01:01:14,260 --> 01:01:15,300
Four.

1809
01:01:15,300 --> 01:01:17,400
(She tries 2,4,6,9.)

1810
01:01:17,400 --> 01:01:20,160
(The lock unlocks.)

1811
01:01:21,200 --> 01:01:23,130
- Is it number four?
- Yes.

1812
01:01:23,160 --> 01:01:24,860
- You're a genius.
- No.

1813
01:01:24,970 --> 01:01:26,070
It's four.

1814
01:01:26,470 --> 01:01:30,550
(What is inside the cabinet
that was locked?)

1815
01:01:30,550 --> 01:01:31,970
- What is it?
- What?

1816
01:01:33,950 --> 01:01:34,950
They're balloons.

1817
01:01:34,950 --> 01:01:36,910
(Are they balloons on plates?)

1818
01:01:37,990 --> 01:01:40,660
(There's a key next to a balloon.)

1819
01:01:40,660 --> 01:01:42,180
Do we have to inflate the balloons?

1820
01:01:42,180 --> 01:01:44,130
(He's curious.)

1821
01:01:44,130 --> 01:01:47,400
(They inflate the balloons first.)

1822
01:01:48,700 --> 01:01:50,470
Wait, ear is number two.

1823
01:01:50,900 --> 01:01:52,490
- Meat is six.
- What about sand?

1824
01:01:53,090 --> 01:01:54,900
Sand is number four.

1825
01:01:54,900 --> 01:01:56,090
It's 2, 4, 6, 9.

1826
01:01:56,090 --> 01:01:57,910
Is it 2, 4, 6, 9?

1827
01:01:59,430 --> 01:02:00,880
What's this?

1828
01:02:00,880 --> 01:02:02,180
(There are only balloons
in the cabinet.)

1829
01:02:02,180 --> 01:02:03,380
What is it?

1830
01:02:03,380 --> 01:02:04,780
What's the point of opening it?

1831
01:02:05,300 --> 01:02:08,010
There's a key. Goodness.

1832
01:02:09,470 --> 01:02:12,150
(Why am I going through this?)

1833
01:02:13,090 --> 01:02:14,280
(Where did Jong Kook go?)

1834
01:02:14,280 --> 01:02:17,550
I'm not smart.

1835
01:02:17,550 --> 01:02:18,630
(She introspects herself quickly.)

1836
01:02:19,430 --> 01:02:21,360
(Class leader in the sixth grade)

1837
01:02:21,360 --> 01:02:22,720
(Class president
in the seventh grade)

1838
01:02:22,720 --> 01:02:24,300
(Class vice president
in the eighth grade)

1839
01:02:24,300 --> 01:02:27,470
(She probably wasn't voted
for being smart.)

1840
01:02:27,470 --> 01:02:29,200
What's this key for?

1841
01:02:29,590 --> 01:02:31,110
I'll keep it for now.

1842
01:02:31,110 --> 01:02:32,200
(What is the key for?)

1843
01:02:32,200 --> 01:02:33,470
(One)

1844
01:02:33,470 --> 01:02:34,740
(Man)

1845
01:02:34,740 --> 01:02:36,200
(Show)

1846
01:02:37,570 --> 01:02:38,780
(At that moment)

1847
01:02:38,780 --> 01:02:41,070
Ji Suk Jin's location is revealed.

1848
01:02:41,680 --> 01:02:43,880
Ji Suk Jin's location is revealed.

1849
01:02:43,880 --> 01:02:45,180
Running away will be of no use.

1850
01:02:45,180 --> 01:02:48,360
Police special forces have been
dispatched to arrest him.

1851
01:02:48,360 --> 01:02:49,450
Someone else is out.

1852
01:02:49,450 --> 01:02:50,450
(Did Suk Jin get eliminated?)

1853
01:02:51,280 --> 01:02:53,450
(Jong Kook left So Min behind.)

1854
01:02:54,990 --> 01:02:56,760
I'm out.

1855
01:02:56,760 --> 01:02:58,570
- What?
- I'm out.

1856
01:02:58,660 --> 01:03:00,200
- Are you out?
- Yes.

1857
01:03:00,200 --> 01:03:01,260
(How did Suk Jin get eliminated?)

1858
01:03:01,260 --> 01:03:02,360
(He checks his name tag.)

1859
01:03:02,360 --> 01:03:03,470
Come this way.

1860
01:03:03,470 --> 01:03:04,860
- You got hit.
- Is it the water gun?

1861
01:03:04,860 --> 01:03:05,910
You got hit.

1862
01:03:07,010 --> 01:03:11,180
(Suk Jin's name tag got shot
by a water gun.)

1863
01:03:12,450 --> 01:03:14,840
So Min, Suk Jin got eliminated.

1864
01:03:15,050 --> 01:03:16,320
He got hit by a water gun.

1865
01:03:16,320 --> 01:03:17,990
(We're in trouble.)

1866
01:03:17,990 --> 01:03:19,840
(What? Water gun?)

1867
01:03:19,840 --> 01:03:21,720
The water was pink.

1868
01:03:23,360 --> 01:03:27,090
(When they received a tool
this morning)

1869
01:03:27,090 --> 01:03:31,570
(The color of the water was
definitely blue.)

1870
01:03:32,930 --> 01:03:35,530
(Why is it pink?)

1871
01:03:35,530 --> 01:03:37,090
- Was it pink?
- Yes.

1872
01:03:37,090 --> 01:03:38,570
- Whose is it?
- Did you get it?

1873
01:03:38,570 --> 01:03:40,030
Hey, Kwang Soo.

1874
01:03:40,030 --> 01:03:41,470
- Kwang Soo.
- Yes?

1875
01:03:42,280 --> 01:03:44,070
Do you have a water gun?

1876
01:03:44,070 --> 01:03:46,280
Yes, I got a gun.

1877
01:03:46,280 --> 01:03:47,470
- What?
- I got it...

1878
01:03:47,470 --> 01:03:48,570
after Haha got eliminated.

1879
01:03:48,570 --> 01:03:51,610
Let me see your water gun.
I have something to check.

1880
01:03:52,510 --> 01:03:53,610
- Shoot it.
- You won't steal it?

1881
01:03:53,610 --> 01:03:54,780
No, just shoot it.

1882
01:03:55,950 --> 01:03:58,360
(It's blue.)

1883
01:03:58,880 --> 01:04:00,950
Suk Jin got eliminated.

1884
01:04:01,530 --> 01:04:04,820
He got hit by a water gun
and the color was pink.

1885
01:04:04,820 --> 01:04:07,160
(They need to find the member
with the pink water.)

1886
01:04:07,200 --> 01:04:09,200
Ours shoot blue.

1887
01:04:09,990 --> 01:04:11,200
The announcements are different.

1888
01:04:11,300 --> 01:04:13,660
When Suk Jin got eliminated,
the announcement was,

1889
01:04:13,840 --> 01:04:15,070
"Ji Suk Jin's location
is revealed."

1890
01:04:15,070 --> 01:04:16,280
"Running away
will be of no use."

1891
01:04:16,280 --> 01:04:17,840
When Se Chan got eliminated,
the announcement was,

1892
01:04:17,910 --> 01:04:19,200
"Yang Se Chan is caught
on surveillance cameras."

1893
01:04:19,200 --> 01:04:20,470
"Se Chan is out."

1894
01:04:20,720 --> 01:04:22,650
That means Haha got hit
by a water gun.

1895
01:04:22,650 --> 01:04:24,050
(The announcement is telling.)

1896
01:04:24,510 --> 01:04:26,590
Ji Suk Jin's location is revealed.

1897
01:04:26,910 --> 01:04:28,220
Running away will be of no use.

1898
01:04:30,490 --> 01:04:33,050
(When Se Chan got eliminated)

1899
01:04:33,050 --> 01:04:34,800
Yang Se Chan is caught
on surveillance cameras.

1900
01:04:35,630 --> 01:04:36,720
Se Chan is out.

1901
01:04:39,070 --> 01:04:42,630
Haha's location is revealed.
Running away will be of no use.

1902
01:04:43,490 --> 01:04:46,840
(Haha got eliminated
by the pink water!)

1903
01:04:47,570 --> 01:04:48,800
Now...

1904
01:04:48,800 --> 01:04:50,240
(Meanwhile, Jae Suk and Ha Na
are still working on the balloons.)

1905
01:04:52,550 --> 01:04:56,450
(What do these balloons mean?)

1906
01:04:56,450 --> 01:04:59,910
(There are 3 balloons
on each plate.)

1907
01:05:00,760 --> 01:05:04,450
(Only the last plate has
2 balloons and a key.)

1908
01:05:04,450 --> 01:05:05,660
I think...

1909
01:05:05,660 --> 01:05:07,630
(They rack their brains.)

1910
01:05:08,260 --> 01:05:09,360
it's about mixing the colors.

1911
01:05:09,360 --> 01:05:11,930
(Could that be it?)

1912
01:05:11,930 --> 01:05:13,860
(Will mixing the colors help them
solve the hint?)

1913
01:05:13,860 --> 01:05:15,070
- Right?
- You are right.

1914
01:05:15,860 --> 01:05:16,990
If we mix the colors...

1915
01:05:19,260 --> 01:05:22,130
(Then the key has to do
with the color pink.)

1916
01:05:22,130 --> 01:05:23,280
Pink.

1917
01:05:23,380 --> 01:05:25,050
(Ha Na did an incredible job
as a hacker.)

1918
01:05:25,050 --> 01:05:26,150
Ha Na, you are right.

1919
01:05:26,910 --> 01:05:28,050
Pink.

1920
01:05:29,610 --> 01:05:31,910
Look at the diary, it's pink.

1921
01:05:35,450 --> 01:05:37,630
(They find a pink diary!)

1922
01:05:37,630 --> 01:05:39,050
(The pink diary is locked.)

1923
01:05:39,050 --> 01:05:40,360
This is incredible.

1924
01:05:41,400 --> 01:05:42,530
This is incredible.

1925
01:05:42,530 --> 01:05:44,700
(They open the lock with the key.)

1926
01:05:44,700 --> 01:05:45,860
What is it?

1927
01:05:45,860 --> 01:05:47,400
"You are almost there.
This is the last problem."

1928
01:05:47,630 --> 01:05:48,930
What is this?

1929
01:05:49,900 --> 01:05:53,160
"Cross you out from 'Partner'
and reverse the rest."

1930
01:05:55,180 --> 01:05:57,280
(Cross you out from 'Partner'
and reverse the rest?)

1931
01:05:57,280 --> 01:05:58,450
Shall we retrace our steps?

1932
01:05:59,610 --> 01:06:00,820
What does this mean?

1933
01:06:00,820 --> 01:06:01,880
(Clueless)

1934
01:06:05,220 --> 01:06:06,220
What is this?

1935
01:06:06,220 --> 01:06:07,340
(So Min is trying to figure out
the use of the key.)

1936
01:06:07,340 --> 01:06:09,820
This key is for a small diary.

1937
01:06:09,820 --> 01:06:10,860
(She had such a diary
when she was little.)

1938
01:06:10,860 --> 01:06:14,590
(From the key, she guesses
that she needs a diary.)

1939
01:06:15,430 --> 01:06:18,570
(She finds the diary.)

1940
01:06:19,590 --> 01:06:20,930
Jong Kook,

1941
01:06:20,930 --> 01:06:22,300
- I found it.
- Hey.

1942
01:06:22,300 --> 01:06:23,430
Come here.

1943
01:06:23,430 --> 01:06:24,760
- I got this.
- What?

1944
01:06:25,360 --> 01:06:27,340
"You are almost there.
This is the last problem."

1945
01:06:27,340 --> 01:06:29,200
- "Cross you out from 'Partner'..."
- Jong Kook, I am exhausted.

1946
01:06:29,200 --> 01:06:31,110
Do you have an energy drink?

1947
01:06:31,880 --> 01:06:34,780
(I want to solve the problem
and relieve my exhaustion.)

1948
01:06:34,780 --> 01:06:37,510
I haven't studied this hard
back in school.

1949
01:06:37,910 --> 01:06:39,680
I am serious.

1950
01:06:39,720 --> 01:06:41,860
"Cross you out from 'Partner'
and reverse the rest."

1951
01:06:41,860 --> 01:06:42,910
What are these?

1952
01:06:42,910 --> 01:06:44,180
What are these balloons?

1953
01:06:44,220 --> 01:06:46,180
The balloons are about
mixing different colors.

1954
01:06:46,180 --> 01:06:47,700
You were supposed to find
the pink diary that way.

1955
01:06:47,700 --> 01:06:48,990
(The production crew reveals
the answer.)

1956
01:06:48,990 --> 01:06:50,090
But you found it without needing to.

1957
01:06:50,970 --> 01:06:52,200
I bypassed that step.

1958
01:06:52,200 --> 01:06:54,300
(She resorted to tricks.)

1959
01:06:54,360 --> 01:06:57,030
I am like a genius.
I got the answer without thinking.

1960
01:06:58,570 --> 01:06:59,570
Jong Kook.

1961
01:06:59,570 --> 01:07:01,030
This is really fascinating.

1962
01:07:01,030 --> 01:07:03,240
Solving the patterns of the colors
gives us pink.

1963
01:07:03,340 --> 01:07:04,470
Really?

1964
01:07:05,280 --> 01:07:06,380
Yes.

1965
01:07:06,450 --> 01:07:08,110
Mixing the colors...

1966
01:07:09,220 --> 01:07:10,380
Jong Kook.

1967
01:07:10,380 --> 01:07:12,380
Let me do it again.
Give me another chance.

1968
01:07:12,380 --> 01:07:13,490
Let me do it again.

1969
01:07:13,650 --> 01:07:15,450
Oh, Jong Kook!

1970
01:07:15,450 --> 01:07:17,450
(Acting surprised)

1971
01:07:17,450 --> 01:07:19,320
If we blow these balloons,

1972
01:07:19,660 --> 01:07:20,900
we get pink.

1973
01:07:21,130 --> 01:07:22,300
Really?

1974
01:07:22,400 --> 01:07:23,630
- Really?
- So...

1975
01:07:23,630 --> 01:07:25,070
(Let's blow the balloons.)

1976
01:07:25,070 --> 01:07:26,490
Then we get the pink diary!

1977
01:07:26,570 --> 01:07:28,130
No way!

1978
01:07:28,130 --> 01:07:29,630
(It's unbelievable!)

1979
01:07:29,630 --> 01:07:30,930
That's it.

1980
01:07:30,930 --> 01:07:32,430
- That's how we get the pink diary.
- That's incredible.

1981
01:07:32,430 --> 01:07:33,740
I found it.

1982
01:07:34,070 --> 01:07:35,510
(Ji Hyo still goes over the letters
like a Ouija board.)

1983
01:07:35,510 --> 01:07:37,300
- Did you solve the passcode?
- Kwang Soo.

1984
01:07:38,680 --> 01:07:40,410
- I can't do this.
- Jae Suk is suspicious.

1985
01:07:41,340 --> 01:07:42,780
(Kwang Soo suspects Jae Suk.)

1986
01:07:42,780 --> 01:07:44,240
What do you mean?

1987
01:07:44,240 --> 01:07:46,240
I think Jae Suk has
another mission.

1988
01:07:46,240 --> 01:07:47,680
(She has no idea
what's going on outside.)

1989
01:07:47,910 --> 01:07:48,950
(She has been inside the room
for an hour.)

1990
01:07:48,950 --> 01:07:50,010
This is driving me crazy.

1991
01:07:50,010 --> 01:07:52,180
This sticks out
from the other books on the shelf.

1992
01:07:55,300 --> 01:07:56,860
Forget about "HOT."

1993
01:07:57,490 --> 01:07:59,160
What is this?

1994
01:07:59,160 --> 01:08:00,840
(She found the pink diary.)

1995
01:08:01,090 --> 01:08:02,590
There should be a key.

1996
01:08:02,590 --> 01:08:05,130
Why is that diary here?

1997
01:08:05,510 --> 01:08:07,680
(Kwang Soo is just as clueless.)

1998
01:08:07,880 --> 01:08:09,010
I can't open it.

1999
01:08:09,010 --> 01:08:11,010
(The two fools struggle.)

2000
01:08:11,010 --> 01:08:13,680
(Kwang Soo gives up.)

2001
01:08:14,150 --> 01:08:15,650
What?

2002
01:08:15,820 --> 01:08:17,910
- What is it?
- Where is that thing?

2003
01:08:18,050 --> 01:08:19,180
- The pen?
- Yes.

2004
01:08:19,180 --> 01:08:22,510
(She wants to use
the appraiser's pen on the diary.)

2005
01:08:22,510 --> 01:08:23,760
That could be it.

2006
01:08:23,760 --> 01:08:24,880
(Eureka.)

2007
01:08:25,260 --> 01:08:27,860
(That's not it.)

2008
01:08:28,320 --> 01:08:29,590
I will look for more items.

2009
01:08:29,920 --> 01:08:32,090
Did you find expensive items?

2010
01:08:32,090 --> 01:08:34,200
Yes, I did. No one else but me
is doing it.

2011
01:08:34,870 --> 01:08:36,500
This makes no sense.

2012
01:08:36,500 --> 01:08:38,410
- We don't have partners today.
- I...

2013
01:08:38,410 --> 01:08:39,870
- Why does it say "Partner"?
- I...

2014
01:08:40,130 --> 01:08:41,910
"You are almost there.
This is the last problem."

2015
01:08:41,910 --> 01:08:43,470
"Cross you out from 'Partner'
and reverse the rest."

2016
01:08:44,000 --> 01:08:45,580
What does "Partner" mean?

2017
01:08:45,750 --> 01:08:47,820
- We don't have partners today.
- Teammate.

2018
01:08:47,950 --> 01:08:49,580
"Cross you out..."

2019
01:08:49,650 --> 01:08:50,750
"Cross you out..."

2020
01:08:51,120 --> 01:08:52,540
Maybe it's about taking out.

2021
01:08:52,540 --> 01:08:53,650
Take out what?

2022
01:08:53,950 --> 01:08:55,710
This makes no sense.

2023
01:08:56,120 --> 01:08:57,210
It's "Part."

2024
01:08:57,210 --> 01:08:58,550
"You" is read as "Ner" in Korean.

2025
01:08:58,880 --> 01:09:00,860
(Cross "Ner" out from "Partner.")

2026
01:09:00,860 --> 01:09:02,790
(Part?)

2027
01:09:03,530 --> 01:09:07,030
(Part)

2028
01:09:07,220 --> 01:09:08,590
- Part.
- That's it.

2029
01:09:08,590 --> 01:09:10,930
If we cross "Ner" out,
we are left with "Part."

2030
01:09:10,930 --> 01:09:12,260
"Cross you out from 'Partner'..."

2031
01:09:12,370 --> 01:09:13,830
Write "Part" in English.

2032
01:09:13,830 --> 01:09:15,540
"And reverse the rest."

2033
01:09:15,610 --> 01:09:16,710
Reverse it.

2034
01:09:16,710 --> 01:09:17,750
(Reverse the rest?)

2035
01:09:17,750 --> 01:09:19,670
- Cross "Ner" out.
- That's right.

2036
01:09:20,780 --> 01:09:23,150
Let's write "Part" in English.
Give it to me.

2037
01:09:23,650 --> 01:09:25,180
Give me the spelling.

2038
01:09:25,290 --> 01:09:26,920
- It's T, R, A, P.
- P.

2039
01:09:28,050 --> 01:09:29,960
(They reverse the letters.)

2040
01:09:29,960 --> 01:09:33,030
(Trap)

2041
01:09:33,250 --> 01:09:35,000
Trap.

2042
01:09:35,050 --> 01:09:36,830
T, R, A, P. Trap.

2043
01:09:37,530 --> 01:09:38,830
- We got "Trap."
- T.

2044
01:09:39,500 --> 01:09:42,760
(They quickly type in "Trap.")

2045
01:09:42,760 --> 01:09:45,130
(They are in!)

2046
01:09:45,130 --> 01:09:46,910
- Trap.
- We are in.

2047
01:09:46,910 --> 01:09:49,040
(So Min and Jong Kook
gain access to the computer.)

2048
01:09:49,040 --> 01:09:50,950
Jong Kook, step outside
for a second.

2049
01:09:50,950 --> 01:09:52,500
- I am anxious.
- Okay.

2050
01:09:52,500 --> 01:09:54,210
(Jong Kook goes outside
to keep the patrol from coming.)

2051
01:09:54,210 --> 01:09:55,750
- Close the door.
- Trap. We got it.

2052
01:09:55,750 --> 01:09:57,320
- The location of Tear of Yondu.
- Hold on.

2053
01:09:57,470 --> 01:09:59,840
How is Ji Hyo supposed
to solve this?

2054
01:09:59,840 --> 01:10:01,820
(Hold on.)

2055
01:10:02,920 --> 01:10:04,160
It's in the basement.

2056
01:10:04,720 --> 01:10:06,050
- I have been there.
- I will take a photo of the plan.

2057
01:10:06,050 --> 01:10:07,330
- Do you know where this place is?
- What?

2058
01:10:07,380 --> 01:10:09,860
I went to the basement earlier.

2059
01:10:09,860 --> 01:10:13,370
(Tear of Yondu is at the end
of the center staircase.)

2060
01:10:13,920 --> 01:10:17,400
(The safe is located in B1.)

2061
01:10:17,460 --> 01:10:19,540
- The password is "Trap."
- It's "Trap."

2062
01:10:19,830 --> 01:10:21,710
Okay. I will go there.

2063
01:10:22,540 --> 01:10:25,800
(He moves to B1 to find the safe.)

2064
01:10:25,870 --> 01:10:28,420
(He is close to finding
Tear of Yondu.)

2065
01:10:29,650 --> 01:10:32,010
(He goes down the staircase
without hesitation.)

2066
01:10:32,010 --> 01:10:33,840
(He remembers to turn off
the surveillance camera.)

2067
01:10:34,550 --> 01:10:37,210
(After turning off
the surveillance camera,)

2068
01:10:37,210 --> 01:10:40,490
(he safely reaches the safe!)

2069
01:10:42,620 --> 01:10:44,530
(If he opens the safe
and gets Tear of Yondu,)

2070
01:10:44,530 --> 01:10:46,500
(Jong Kook's team will win!)

2071
01:10:47,370 --> 01:10:50,260
(When he enters the password,
"Trap,")

2072
01:10:50,260 --> 01:10:52,430
(the safe opens!)

2073
01:10:53,210 --> 01:10:55,740
(He checks what's inside.)

2074
01:10:56,370 --> 01:10:59,910
(It's not Tear of Yondu,
but a mysterious file.)

2075
01:11:00,470 --> 01:11:03,580
(He takes the file
and moves hurriedly!)

2076
01:11:03,950 --> 01:11:06,120
Jong Kook! Jong Kook!

2077
01:11:06,180 --> 01:11:07,510
Jong Kook!

2078
01:11:07,620 --> 01:11:09,820
Jong Kook! Jong Kook!

2079
01:11:09,820 --> 01:11:11,880
Jong Kook!

2080
01:11:11,880 --> 01:11:14,030
- What is it? What's wrong?
- Jong Kook!

2081
01:11:14,530 --> 01:11:16,000
Who is it? What's wrong?

2082
01:11:16,000 --> 01:11:17,530
(So Min got attacked by someone.)

2083
01:11:17,530 --> 01:11:19,530
- So Min's location is revealed.
- Who is it? What's wrong?

2084
01:11:19,530 --> 01:11:22,330
Police special forces have been
dispatched to arrest her.

2085
01:11:22,330 --> 01:11:23,370
Jong Kook.

2086
01:11:24,460 --> 01:11:27,370
(To make matters worse,
they hear the cuckoo sound.)

2087
01:11:27,370 --> 01:11:28,430
(Jong Kook leaves hurriedly.)

2088
01:11:28,430 --> 01:11:30,040
I will go and hide.

2089
01:11:30,040 --> 01:11:31,150
My goodness.

2090
01:11:31,410 --> 01:11:35,210
(But Jong Kook doesn't know
which area the patrol will be.)

2091
01:11:35,320 --> 01:11:37,210
All right. Come in quickly.

2092
01:11:37,210 --> 01:11:39,540
(He hides in a nearby room.)

2093
01:11:41,290 --> 01:11:42,460
(Jae Suk's team knows
the patrol location...)

2094
01:11:42,460 --> 01:11:44,920
(and hides accordingly.)

2095
01:11:45,530 --> 01:11:46,580
The patrol.

2096
01:11:46,580 --> 01:11:48,030
(Ji Hyo doesn't know
the patrol location,)

2097
01:11:48,030 --> 01:11:49,860
(so she hides as well as possible.)

2098
01:11:50,660 --> 01:11:52,570
(She hides every inch of her body
in case the patrol enters the room.)

2099
01:11:52,570 --> 01:11:53,760
I need to hide.

2100
01:11:53,920 --> 01:11:57,330
(The patrol enters the mansion.)

2101
01:11:58,800 --> 01:12:00,800
(Once he takes cover,)

2102
01:12:00,800 --> 01:12:03,410
(Jong Kook checks the file.)

2103
01:12:06,080 --> 01:12:07,300
For goodness' sake.

2104
01:12:09,170 --> 01:12:10,340
This is yet another twist.

2105
01:12:10,340 --> 01:12:11,450
(What does the file reveal?)

2106
01:12:11,450 --> 01:12:12,580
There is a spy.

2107
01:12:12,580 --> 01:12:13,990
(A spy?)

2108
01:12:15,510 --> 01:12:18,860
(A mysterious report
inside the file)

2109
01:12:20,680 --> 01:12:26,220
(Lure the 8 thieves
to 1 police officer's house.)

2110
01:12:26,330 --> 01:12:29,670
Today, we will play
Empty House: Oh, My Thieves.

2111
01:12:29,670 --> 01:12:32,800
You are the police officer
who is hiding among the thieves.

2112
01:12:34,830 --> 01:12:37,840
But the empty mansion
the thieves will rob...

2113
01:12:37,950 --> 01:12:39,610
belongs to you, the police officer.

2114
01:12:39,970 --> 01:12:43,170
The police officer
will carry out a sting operation...

2115
01:12:43,170 --> 01:12:45,490
called Tear of Yondu Project
to catch the thieves.

2116
01:12:45,880 --> 01:12:48,290
The object of the thieves' desire,
Tear of Yondu,

2117
01:12:48,290 --> 01:12:51,160
will be in your possession,
the police officer.

2118
01:12:52,120 --> 01:12:54,660
You win by shooting the water gun
on the thieves' name tags...

2119
01:12:54,660 --> 01:12:57,030
and arresting all of them
in the final race.

2120
01:12:57,090 --> 01:13:00,090
You lose by getting eliminated
by the thieves first.

2121
01:13:00,330 --> 01:13:03,040
The thief who eliminates you
will take Tear of Yondu,

2122
01:13:03,040 --> 01:13:04,330
and their team will win the race.

2123
01:13:06,570 --> 01:13:09,170
(There is a police officer
among us.)

2124
01:13:10,210 --> 01:13:11,870
(Knocking)

2125
01:13:12,950 --> 01:13:14,780
(Who is it?)

2126
01:13:15,280 --> 01:13:16,450
It's the police!

2127
01:13:17,710 --> 01:13:19,820
(The police?)

2128
01:13:20,490 --> 01:13:21,750
I didn't get hit by a water gun.

2129
01:13:23,680 --> 01:13:26,550
(The police rush into the room
Jong Kook is hiding.)

2130
01:13:26,550 --> 01:13:28,200
What? What is going on?

2131
01:13:28,420 --> 01:13:29,660
Do I just get caught?

2132
01:13:31,090 --> 01:13:33,620
(Jong Kook's team didn't get a hint
on the patrol schedule.)

2133
01:13:34,000 --> 01:13:36,330
(Thus, they didn't know
where the police will be.)

2134
01:13:36,590 --> 01:13:38,930
(Patrol schedule)

2135
01:13:38,930 --> 01:13:41,130
(Patrol location at 4:30 p.m.,
Hacker's Room 1, Reception Room...)

2136
01:13:41,280 --> 01:13:44,470
(He hid in a room that was included
in the patrol schedule.)

2137
01:13:45,250 --> 01:13:47,950
(Jong Kook uses brute force
to avoid arrest.)

2138
01:13:47,950 --> 01:13:49,620
What happens now?

2139
01:13:49,820 --> 01:13:51,040
Do I just get caught?

2140
01:13:51,040 --> 01:13:52,120
(But he is trapped.)

2141
01:13:52,750 --> 01:13:55,050
(Jong Kook couldn't avoid
the patrol.)

2142
01:13:55,050 --> 01:13:57,550
- You are under arrest.
- How can this be?

2143
01:13:57,660 --> 01:14:00,160
(The patrol finds him.
Kim Jong Kook is out.)

2144
01:14:00,880 --> 01:14:04,760
Thief Kim Jong Kook was
eliminated by the patrol.

2145
01:14:05,870 --> 01:14:08,930
(Team Jae Suk heads to the safe
after realizing its location.)

2146
01:14:10,000 --> 01:14:11,460
- It opened.
- It did.

2147
01:14:11,800 --> 01:14:14,370
(The safe is empty.)

2148
01:14:16,540 --> 01:14:18,750
- Is there a hint?
- No.

2149
01:14:19,280 --> 01:14:20,870
Aren't you looking for a hint?

2150
01:14:20,870 --> 01:14:22,820
I know, but we didn't find it.

2151
01:14:23,170 --> 01:14:25,120
We can't find it anywhere.

2152
01:14:25,620 --> 01:14:27,750
We need the hint to solve it.

2153
01:14:28,290 --> 01:14:29,380
Ji Hyo.

2154
01:14:29,380 --> 01:14:30,750
The other team figured it out.

2155
01:14:30,750 --> 01:14:32,750
- Really? I found it.
- What?

2156
01:14:33,160 --> 01:14:35,050
There's a piece of paper.

2157
01:14:35,050 --> 01:14:36,160
I found it.

2158
01:14:36,460 --> 01:14:37,700
Look at it.

2159
01:14:37,700 --> 01:14:39,530
(She shares what she found
with Kwang Soo.)

2160
01:14:39,530 --> 01:14:41,030
"Sand went into my ear,
so I went to the hospital."

2161
01:14:41,030 --> 01:14:43,070
"More people had mouth pain
from eating meat."

2162
01:14:43,400 --> 01:14:44,960
(Who is she?)

2163
01:14:44,960 --> 01:14:46,430
What could this mean?

2164
01:14:47,540 --> 01:14:49,630
(Jae Suk is looking for hints.)

2165
01:14:50,780 --> 01:14:53,110
(In the room where
Jong Kook was eliminated,)

2166
01:14:53,110 --> 01:14:56,040
(he finds a project folder.)

2167
01:14:56,540 --> 01:14:57,750
What's this?

2168
01:14:57,750 --> 01:15:00,120
(He checks the contents
of the folder.)

2169
01:15:00,120 --> 01:15:02,050
"Lure the eight thieves...

2170
01:15:02,380 --> 01:15:05,250
to one police officer's house."

2171
01:15:05,460 --> 01:15:06,550
Ha Na.

2172
01:15:06,550 --> 01:15:08,120
(He tries to share the information
with Ha Na.)

2173
01:15:09,000 --> 01:15:11,500
Thief Park Ha Na's location is
revealed.

2174
01:15:11,620 --> 01:15:15,630
Police special forces will be
dispatched to arrest her.

2175
01:15:16,760 --> 01:15:18,070
(How did I get caught?)

2176
01:15:18,070 --> 01:15:19,410
Where was the camera?

2177
01:15:19,740 --> 01:15:22,780
(The police find out
Ha Na's location.)

2178
01:15:23,470 --> 01:15:26,970
(Is Ha Na out?)

2179
01:15:26,970 --> 01:15:28,120
Why Ha Na?

2180
01:15:29,370 --> 01:15:33,040
(There's pink on her name tag.)

2181
01:15:34,750 --> 01:15:38,460
(Arrested by the police,
Ha Na is out.)

2182
01:15:38,990 --> 01:15:40,490
Be careful, Ji Hyo.

2183
01:15:40,490 --> 01:15:42,550
- Why?
- Not many people are left.

2184
01:15:42,700 --> 01:15:45,370
It looks like six members remain.

2185
01:15:45,370 --> 01:15:46,570
There are 2, 2, and 2.

2186
01:15:46,700 --> 01:15:48,290
To solve this...

2187
01:15:48,900 --> 01:15:50,740
- I had such...
- What did you say?

2188
01:15:50,740 --> 01:15:52,540
- I had a hard time solving it.
- Before that.

2189
01:15:52,910 --> 01:15:55,670
- How many people remain?
- Six people, isn't it?

2190
01:15:55,670 --> 01:15:57,630
You were in there for too long.
Follow me back in.

2191
01:15:57,630 --> 01:15:59,580
- Did something happen?
- Stay inside.

2192
01:15:59,580 --> 01:16:02,010
- Why?
- Everyone got eliminated.

2193
01:16:02,320 --> 01:16:03,750
That was such a long time ago.

2194
01:16:03,750 --> 01:16:05,650
Look, Suk Jin,

2195
01:16:05,650 --> 01:16:07,620
Se Chan, and Haha are out.

2196
01:16:07,620 --> 01:16:09,750
- So Min and Jong Kook are out too.
- What?

2197
01:16:10,580 --> 01:16:11,920
- Really?
- Yes.

2198
01:16:12,460 --> 01:16:13,830
Only these remain?

2199
01:16:14,420 --> 01:16:15,660
I didn't know, Kwang Soo.

2200
01:16:15,660 --> 01:16:17,860
- I stayed here too long.
- You stayed in this room too long.

2201
01:16:17,860 --> 01:16:20,700
You're like the one from "Old Boy."

2202
01:16:20,700 --> 01:16:22,430
- I know.
- The world changed.

2203
01:16:23,830 --> 01:16:25,040
(As if hiding
from a surprise attack)

2204
01:16:25,040 --> 01:16:26,300
Let's see.

2205
01:16:26,300 --> 01:16:29,610
(Ji Hyo hid in a cabinet.)

2206
01:16:30,630 --> 01:16:33,210
(While hiding,)

2207
01:16:33,210 --> 01:16:38,710
(many of her colleagues left.)

2208
01:16:39,290 --> 01:16:40,880
It's not six anymore.

2209
01:16:40,880 --> 01:16:42,050
My goodness.

2210
01:16:42,860 --> 01:16:45,880
(Jae Suk enters the room
where Kwang Soo and Ji Hyo are.)

2211
01:16:45,880 --> 01:16:47,160
Kwang Soo.

2212
01:16:47,160 --> 01:16:48,590
(The situation has changed.)

2213
01:16:48,590 --> 01:16:49,790
Gosh, hey.

2214
01:16:50,460 --> 01:16:52,760
(Kwang Soo passes the water gun
to Ji Hyo.)

2215
01:16:53,070 --> 01:16:54,500
(Calm down and listen to me.)

2216
01:16:54,500 --> 01:16:57,570
A police officer is inside.

2217
01:16:57,870 --> 01:16:59,210
- What?
- Inside?

2218
01:17:00,260 --> 01:17:02,830
- What do you mean?
- It's a police officer's house.

2219
01:17:03,610 --> 01:17:05,670
- What do you mean?
- It's a trap.

2220
01:17:06,650 --> 01:17:07,800
Look at this.

2221
01:17:07,800 --> 01:17:09,710
(He shares information
about the police.)

2222
01:17:10,210 --> 01:17:11,880
Is this it?

2223
01:17:12,180 --> 01:17:14,380
There's no point in searching.

2224
01:17:14,380 --> 01:17:16,360
The police officer already
has the necklace.

2225
01:17:16,360 --> 01:17:18,490
Do we have to eliminate
the police officer?

2226
01:17:18,790 --> 01:17:20,050
I think so.

2227
01:17:20,180 --> 01:17:22,000
(Only three people remain.)

2228
01:17:22,000 --> 01:17:24,700
(One of them is a police officer.)

2229
01:17:25,420 --> 01:17:27,420
It's 10 minutes before 5 p.m.

2230
01:17:27,420 --> 01:17:30,630
After 5 p.m., you will be locked
inside this mansion.

2231
01:17:32,000 --> 01:17:33,130
Let's go.

2232
01:17:33,130 --> 01:17:34,830
(They have to find the officer
before the mansion gets locked.)

2233
01:17:34,830 --> 01:17:36,000
Ji Hyo.

2234
01:17:36,870 --> 01:17:38,750
- It's Jae Suk.
- How do you know?

2235
01:17:38,750 --> 01:17:40,580
He stayed with Ha Na all along.

2236
01:17:41,110 --> 01:17:42,210
Isn't it you?

2237
01:17:42,470 --> 01:17:44,280
No, how could I be?

2238
01:17:44,470 --> 01:17:46,340
- Isn't it you?
- I'm not.

2239
01:17:46,750 --> 01:17:48,620
Why do you keep accusing Jae Suk?

2240
01:17:48,820 --> 01:17:50,490
It's one of us three.

2241
01:17:50,880 --> 01:17:52,530
I know that it's not you.

2242
01:17:52,530 --> 01:17:55,460
And Ha Na got eliminated
when she was with him.

2243
01:17:56,460 --> 01:17:57,900
We have 10 minutes left.

2244
01:17:59,370 --> 01:18:01,830
- Watch where Jae Suk is going.
- Okay.

2245
01:18:01,830 --> 01:18:03,170
- I'm here.
- What?

2246
01:18:04,170 --> 01:18:05,500
- I'm here.
- What?

2247
01:18:05,500 --> 01:18:06,610
(Speak of the devil...)

2248
01:18:06,610 --> 01:18:08,830
Gosh, you startled me.

2249
01:18:08,830 --> 01:18:11,470
- You dirty...
- I was telling her to be careful.

2250
01:18:11,470 --> 01:18:14,370
I was telling her to be careful
since she's on my team.

2251
01:18:15,080 --> 01:18:18,420
What happened
while I was in the room?

2252
01:18:19,120 --> 01:18:22,510
In my opinion,
it's not you, Ji Hyo.

2253
01:18:22,510 --> 01:18:23,750
It's not me.

2254
01:18:23,750 --> 01:18:26,620
I just came out
after solving the passcode.

2255
01:18:26,620 --> 01:18:29,220
(Ji Hyo claims to be innocent.)

2256
01:18:30,500 --> 01:18:32,920
(Ji Hyo took a long time
to figure out the hint.)

2257
01:18:32,920 --> 01:18:36,040
(What if she left the room
during that time?)

2258
01:18:36,700 --> 01:18:39,460
(Kwang Soo is
another police candidate.)

2259
01:18:39,460 --> 01:18:41,070
That's the surveillance camera.

2260
01:18:41,580 --> 01:18:43,630
(Thieves turned off
the surveillance camera.)

2261
01:18:43,630 --> 01:18:45,870
(But Kwang Soo turned it back on.)

2262
01:18:45,870 --> 01:18:49,080
(Did he do it to catch thieves?)

2263
01:18:49,510 --> 01:18:51,750
(The last police candidate is
Jae Suk.)

2264
01:18:51,950 --> 01:18:53,210
Why is my photo here?

2265
01:18:53,210 --> 01:18:54,880
(There was a big photo of Jae Suk
from the start.)

2266
01:18:55,210 --> 01:18:57,580
(She's suspicious.)

2267
01:18:58,550 --> 01:19:03,200
(Was his photo here because
he's the owner of the house?)

2268
01:19:03,700 --> 01:19:05,000
Is it you?

2269
01:19:05,000 --> 01:19:07,670
My goodness.

2270
01:19:07,900 --> 01:19:10,590
Ji Hyo, considering many things,

2271
01:19:11,760 --> 01:19:13,210
he's the police officer.

2272
01:19:13,330 --> 01:19:15,040
Gosh.

2273
01:19:15,910 --> 01:19:16,930
Wait.

2274
01:19:16,930 --> 01:19:19,870
- Your fate depends on me.
- Explain your photo.

2275
01:19:19,870 --> 01:19:20,970
What?

2276
01:19:20,970 --> 01:19:22,620
If this isn't your house,

2277
01:19:22,870 --> 01:19:24,280
why is there a large photo of you?

2278
01:19:24,510 --> 01:19:25,840
What do you think?

2279
01:19:26,540 --> 01:19:30,880
That was placed by the police
officer who lured us here.

2280
01:19:31,050 --> 01:19:33,120
As I said, this entire...

2281
01:19:33,120 --> 01:19:34,580
Why are you stammering?

2282
01:19:34,580 --> 01:19:36,120
(She's very suspicious.)

2283
01:19:36,250 --> 01:19:38,160
Ji Hyo, you have to decide quickly.

2284
01:19:38,460 --> 01:19:39,760
- We have no time.
- Ji Hyo.

2285
01:19:39,760 --> 01:19:41,700
It's over once you're eliminated.

2286
01:19:42,290 --> 01:19:44,130
He's wearing a bulletproof jacket.

2287
01:19:44,740 --> 01:19:46,110
Do you understand what I mean?

2288
01:19:46,110 --> 01:19:47,300
(He's the only one
wearing a bulletproof jacket.)

2289
01:19:47,300 --> 01:19:48,430
He won't die.

2290
01:19:48,430 --> 01:19:49,500
(He can protect himself
from elimination.)

2291
01:19:49,500 --> 01:19:51,370
The one who remains will be
eliminated.

2292
01:19:52,710 --> 01:19:54,150
- Okay?
- I can't eliminate you.

2293
01:19:54,150 --> 01:19:56,710
One of us has to take off
his bulletproof jacket.

2294
01:19:56,710 --> 01:19:58,340
Conditions should be even.

2295
01:19:58,340 --> 01:19:59,710
- That's true. That's my decision.
- Yes.

2296
01:19:59,710 --> 01:20:01,340
Let's make it fair.

2297
01:20:01,340 --> 01:20:02,510
Will you shoot me?

2298
01:20:02,510 --> 01:20:04,580
- You have the bulletproof vest on.
- We need to take it off first.

2299
01:20:04,580 --> 01:20:06,330
- Right.
- Take off the bulletproof vest.

2300
01:20:06,330 --> 01:20:07,860
- Isn't that fair?
- Let's start with that.

2301
01:20:07,860 --> 01:20:09,160
Okay.

2302
01:20:09,160 --> 01:20:11,570
(He takes off the bulletproof vest
to get rid of the suspicion.)

2303
01:20:11,570 --> 01:20:12,900
(Shooting)

2304
01:20:13,000 --> 01:20:15,630
Kwang Soo, take off
the bulletproof vest.

2305
01:20:15,630 --> 01:20:18,430
Jae Suk's gun can't be used
anymore.

2306
01:20:20,460 --> 01:20:22,280
- Is that right?
- Yes.

2307
01:20:22,870 --> 01:20:24,910
Kwang Soo can't be...

2308
01:20:24,910 --> 01:20:26,000
(Only Ji Hyo's water gun remains.)

2309
01:20:27,500 --> 01:20:30,470
It'll be difficult
if he's not the police officer.

2310
01:20:33,210 --> 01:20:35,080
(Ji Hyo discovers something.)

2311
01:20:35,080 --> 01:20:36,790
What is Kwang Soo doing? Wait.

2312
01:20:36,790 --> 01:20:39,920
(Inside Kwang Soo's
cameraman's bag,)

2313
01:20:39,920 --> 01:20:41,830
(there's pink-colored water.)

2314
01:20:41,830 --> 01:20:44,700
Suk Jin got eliminated.
He got hit by a water gun.

2315
01:20:44,860 --> 01:20:46,670
The water was pink.

2316
01:20:46,670 --> 01:20:48,900
(It's the water gun
that shot Suk Jin.)

2317
01:20:49,290 --> 01:20:52,500
(If Kwang Soo has pink water...)

2318
01:20:52,670 --> 01:20:54,540
What is Kwang Soo doing? Wait.

2319
01:20:54,540 --> 01:20:55,870
(Kwang Soo is the police officer.)

2320
01:20:57,210 --> 01:20:58,300
He has a water gun.

2321
01:20:58,300 --> 01:21:00,170
- Jae Suk, I'll shoot.
- Go away.

2322
01:21:00,170 --> 01:21:01,650
(Officer Kwang Soo takes action.)

2323
01:21:01,920 --> 01:21:05,250
Today race is called
Empty House: Oh, My Thieves.

2324
01:21:05,250 --> 01:21:08,620
You're the police officer hiding
among the thieves.

2325
01:21:10,250 --> 01:21:13,120
I'll show you that justice prevails.

2326
01:21:15,360 --> 01:21:17,220
(Surveillance cameras
that were turned off...)

2327
01:21:17,220 --> 01:21:19,670
(were turned back on by Kwang Soo.)

2328
01:21:20,720 --> 01:21:23,670
(Se Chan walked around
without noticing the camera.)

2329
01:21:25,910 --> 01:21:28,910
(Caught on surveillance camera,
Se Chan is out.)

2330
01:21:28,910 --> 01:21:30,870
(Se Chan is out.)

2331
01:21:30,870 --> 01:21:33,970
(Kwang Soo can win
only after eliminating all thieves.)

2332
01:21:34,710 --> 01:21:37,950
(He eliminates Haha
with his water gun.)

2333
01:21:39,290 --> 01:21:40,580
What?

2334
01:21:40,580 --> 01:21:41,620
(Without his identity known,
he eliminates Suk Jin.)

2335
01:21:41,620 --> 01:21:42,790
What are you?

2336
01:21:42,790 --> 01:21:44,080
Am I out?

2337
01:21:44,680 --> 01:21:47,990
Jong Kook, Jong Kook!

2338
01:21:47,990 --> 01:21:50,460
(So Min gets eliminated
wandering alone.)

2339
01:21:51,290 --> 01:21:53,870
(Kwang Soo is the police officer.)

2340
01:21:54,670 --> 01:21:56,240
- How...
- I'm sorry.

2341
01:21:56,240 --> 01:21:58,710
(Even he eliminates Ha Na.)

2342
01:21:59,610 --> 01:22:03,040
(Under the name of justice,
he eliminated many thieves.)

2343
01:22:03,300 --> 01:22:05,170
- Jae Suk, I'll shoot.
- Go away.

2344
01:22:05,170 --> 01:22:06,910
- Go.
- I'll shoot him.

2345
01:22:06,910 --> 01:22:08,280
Please.

2346
01:22:08,280 --> 01:22:09,970
- Wait.
- I'll do it.

2347
01:22:09,970 --> 01:22:11,790
(The one who shoots wins.)

2348
01:22:11,790 --> 01:22:13,150
Catch him.

2349
01:22:13,150 --> 01:22:14,580
Shoot Jae Suk!

2350
01:22:14,680 --> 01:22:16,860
- Why you...
- You think I'd fall for that?

2351
01:22:16,860 --> 01:22:18,620
(Shooting)

2352
01:22:18,720 --> 01:22:20,660
(He blocks the shot with his face.)

2353
01:22:20,860 --> 01:22:22,250
I'm the justice.

2354
01:22:23,000 --> 01:22:25,500
- Get lost, both of you!
- That's nonsense.

2355
01:22:26,090 --> 01:22:27,400
(At that moment)

2356
01:22:27,400 --> 01:22:29,290
(Kwang Soo aims
for Jae Suk's name tag.)

2357
01:22:29,290 --> 01:22:31,090
(Unfortunately, he misses.)

2358
01:22:32,240 --> 01:22:33,570
(She counterattacks right away.)

2359
01:22:33,570 --> 01:22:35,240
- Shoot him.
- I got it.

2360
01:22:35,240 --> 01:22:36,370
I shot him.

2361
01:22:36,370 --> 01:22:37,800
(The thief's water gun can
eliminate only one person.)

2362
01:22:37,800 --> 01:22:38,870
(Did she hit him?)

2363
01:22:38,870 --> 01:22:40,170
It's over.

2364
01:22:40,300 --> 01:22:41,710
It's over.

2365
01:22:42,340 --> 01:22:44,540
(There's a clear blue spot.)

2366
01:22:45,650 --> 01:22:47,490
- You got hit.
- Did I get hit?

2367
01:22:48,680 --> 01:22:50,180
(Did I get hit?)

2368
01:22:50,180 --> 01:22:52,380
(He got hit.)

2369
01:22:52,880 --> 01:22:54,660
- Ji Hyo.
- He got hit.

2370
01:22:54,660 --> 01:22:55,920
Jae Suk.

2371
01:22:55,920 --> 01:22:57,460
- Did I get hit?
- I'm sorry.

2372
01:22:57,590 --> 01:22:59,790
- I'm sorry for suspecting you.
- It's okay.

2373
01:23:00,420 --> 01:23:02,700
- You did it, Ji Hyo.
- Gosh.

2374
01:23:02,700 --> 01:23:04,930
How could he fool me completely?

2375
01:23:04,930 --> 01:23:06,710
(I had to win for justice.)

2376
01:23:06,710 --> 01:23:07,930
Goodness.

2377
01:23:09,130 --> 01:23:10,830
- I'll announce the result.
- Okay.

2378
01:23:11,040 --> 01:23:14,450
The final winner is Team Thieves.

2379
01:23:15,040 --> 01:23:16,950
Officer Kwang Soo lost.

2380
01:23:16,950 --> 01:23:18,150
- Did you lose?
- Did you?

2381
01:23:18,150 --> 01:23:20,040
- That's right.
- He lost his initial intention.

2382
01:23:20,040 --> 01:23:21,180
Did Kwang Soo lose?

2383
01:23:21,180 --> 01:23:23,860
The final winner
of today's race is...

2384
01:23:23,860 --> 01:23:26,580
Ji Hyo who won Tear of Yondu.

2385
01:23:26,750 --> 01:23:27,880
Is it Ji Hyo?

2386
01:23:28,080 --> 01:23:29,750
- What's this?
- What's this?

2387
01:23:29,750 --> 01:23:31,400
I came an hour early for this.

2388
01:23:31,400 --> 01:23:32,920
This is Tear of Yondu.

2389
01:23:33,000 --> 01:23:34,500
I should have worked harder.

2390
01:23:34,500 --> 01:23:35,570
(He's very disappointed.)

2391
01:23:35,570 --> 01:23:37,090
She was so funny.

2392
01:23:37,090 --> 01:23:39,760
When she came out after solving
the passcode, everyone was dead.

2393
01:23:40,210 --> 01:23:43,300
When I came out, everyone was dead.

2394
01:23:43,300 --> 01:23:44,630
(Ji Hyo also wins a nice present.)

2395
01:23:44,630 --> 01:23:47,470
Kwang Soo the police officer is
the only one who lost.

2396
01:23:48,210 --> 01:23:49,750
He'll be penalized
with the water cannon.

2397
01:23:49,750 --> 01:23:52,950
- What?
- It's the last thing that we hoped.

2398
01:23:53,180 --> 01:23:54,510
How about this?

2399
01:23:54,680 --> 01:23:56,160
Don't hit his entire body.

2400
01:23:56,360 --> 01:23:57,680
Just hit his head.

2401
01:23:57,680 --> 01:23:59,530
- His head?
- That's better.

2402
01:23:59,530 --> 01:24:00,680
- The head is the best.
- Okay.

2403
01:24:00,680 --> 01:24:02,550
- I'll take that.
- You can do that instead.

2404
01:24:02,550 --> 01:24:03,860
Or get it in your face.

2405
01:24:03,860 --> 01:24:05,670
- Let's go out for the penalty.
- Thank you.

2406
01:24:05,670 --> 01:24:06,700
Okay.

2407
01:24:09,330 --> 01:24:11,460
Kwang Soo will get his penalty.

2408
01:24:11,460 --> 01:24:13,710
It will only hit my head, right?

2409
01:24:13,710 --> 01:24:15,110
- Only your head.
- Thank you.

2410
01:24:15,500 --> 01:24:17,470
- Stay back and stick out your head.
- Okay.

2411
01:24:17,470 --> 01:24:18,470
One,

2412
01:24:19,150 --> 01:24:20,210
two,

2413
01:24:20,780 --> 01:24:21,840
three.

2414
01:24:22,170 --> 01:24:23,420
Happy New Year!

2415
01:24:25,080 --> 01:24:26,250
Stand back.

2416
01:24:26,340 --> 01:24:29,160
(Splashing)

2417
01:24:29,290 --> 01:24:30,460
Stand back.

2418
01:24:31,460 --> 01:24:33,290
(We prepared a lot, thinking
8 thieves would get this.)

2419
01:24:33,290 --> 01:24:34,360
- Hey.
- What was that?

2420
01:24:34,360 --> 01:24:35,900
Kwang Soo.

2421
01:24:36,530 --> 01:24:38,360
- There was so much water.
- What was that?

2422
01:24:38,360 --> 01:24:39,760
(You said it'd only splash my head!)

2423
01:24:39,760 --> 01:24:41,330
What is this?

2424
01:24:41,330 --> 01:24:42,540
- Okay.
- Okay.

2425
01:24:42,670 --> 01:24:43,700
Good job.

2426
01:24:43,700 --> 01:24:45,240
- Good job.
- Thank you.

2427
01:24:45,240 --> 01:24:46,570
(Thank you for joining
the show today, Ha Na.)

2428
01:24:47,460 --> 01:24:49,470
(There's a fancy party
to celebrate an occasion?)

2429
01:24:50,410 --> 01:24:53,080
(They reveal the presents
they prepared with all their heart.)

2430
01:24:53,840 --> 01:24:56,170
(Their memories of 10 years
are revealed with the presents too.)

2431
01:24:56,450 --> 01:24:58,250
(The party isn't over yet!)

2432
01:24:58,250 --> 01:25:01,150
(Even Jong Kook joins
the parade of the cute acts.)

2433
01:25:01,150 --> 01:25:02,290
That's so cute.

2434
01:25:02,920 --> 01:25:05,050
(A feast with rare dishes)

2435
01:25:06,030 --> 01:25:09,220
(Special effects you see
only in blockbusters)

2436
01:25:10,050 --> 01:25:12,570
(The one who enjoys the party
is the winner.)

2437
01:25:12,920 --> 01:25:14,870
(And...)

2438
01:25:14,870 --> 01:25:18,330
(they introduce their friends
who attended the party.)

2439
01:25:18,330 --> 01:25:20,460
(Sometimes, you can't
anticipate our behaviors.)

2440
01:25:20,460 --> 01:25:22,470
(Sometimes,
we express intense feelings.)

2441
01:25:23,000 --> 01:25:24,280
(What's the secret weapon...)

2442
01:25:24,280 --> 01:25:26,670
(that will move the friend's heart?)

2443
01:25:26,670 --> 01:25:28,280
(A Special Party: Hungry Race)
