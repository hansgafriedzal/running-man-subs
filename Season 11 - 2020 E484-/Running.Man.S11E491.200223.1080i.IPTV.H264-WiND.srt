1
00:00:05,850 --> 00:00:06,970
(Last week)

2
00:00:07,350 --> 00:00:10,310
(Our family, Kang Han Na and
Heo Kyung-hwan joined us again.)

3
00:00:10,590 --> 00:00:13,090
(And they got 10 different phones.)

4
00:00:13,310 --> 00:00:16,080
(They all picked a phone randomly.)

5
00:00:16,080 --> 00:00:17,130
The time is ticking.

6
00:00:17,130 --> 00:00:20,030
(Each phone has a stopwatch
with different times.)

7
00:00:21,030 --> 00:00:24,520
As soon as your time runs out,
you will be eliminated.

8
00:00:24,630 --> 00:00:27,700
(As soon as their times run out,
they get eliminated immediately.)

9
00:00:27,700 --> 00:00:30,310
(The members who are eliminated...)

10
00:00:30,340 --> 00:00:35,040
(will be the judges
during the race.)

11
00:00:35,410 --> 00:00:39,740
(While they stay in the time circle,
the countdown is paused.)

12
00:00:39,740 --> 00:00:43,450
(The missions continue
in their different times.)

13
00:00:44,410 --> 00:00:45,660
<i>- Jae Suk, three
- Strawberry...</i>

14
00:00:45,660 --> 00:00:48,160
(Jae Suk is a strawberry fool.)

15
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:50,420
(Hurry. I don't have time.)

16
00:00:50,830 --> 00:00:54,260
(The members who win
get to spin the roulette.)

17
00:00:54,260 --> 00:00:55,700
(Steal the invested time
from another)

18
00:00:55,900 --> 00:00:58,420
(I'll steal time from Suk Jin.)

19
00:00:58,900 --> 00:01:01,590
(Suk Jin is the 1st one
to be eliminated.)

20
00:01:02,700 --> 00:01:04,460
(That's how they got...)

21
00:01:04,460 --> 00:01:06,480
(the 1st judge.)

22
00:01:06,480 --> 00:01:07,730
Do I get no screen time now?

23
00:01:07,730 --> 00:01:09,650
(Countdown Race Final Mission)

24
00:01:09,650 --> 00:01:11,450
(Time Expedition)

25
00:01:11,450 --> 00:01:12,850
It's going to be
Name Tag Elimination.

26
00:01:12,850 --> 00:01:15,650
If you rip off the name tag of
someone who has less time than you,

27
00:01:15,650 --> 00:01:18,540
you get to steal half of their time.

28
00:01:18,540 --> 00:01:21,210
If you rip off the name tag of
someone who has more time than you,

29
00:01:21,210 --> 00:01:23,120
you lose half your time.

30
00:01:23,120 --> 00:01:24,960
Hold on.

31
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:27,900
- Everybody will come at me.
- Wait up.

32
00:01:27,900 --> 00:01:29,620
The piranhas will rip him apart.

33
00:01:29,620 --> 00:01:32,740
If you hold hands with another
member, your times get combined.

34
00:01:32,740 --> 00:01:34,570
- What?
- If you hold hands?

35
00:01:34,840 --> 00:01:37,740
Let's say Jae Suk has 10 minutes,
and Jong Kook has 70.

36
00:01:37,740 --> 00:01:39,630
If they hold hands,
their times become 80 minutes.

37
00:01:39,630 --> 00:01:42,270
If they rip off So Min's name tag
who has 20 minutes left,

38
00:01:42,270 --> 00:01:44,070
they can steal half
of her 20 minutes.

39
00:01:44,070 --> 00:01:46,450
Each person will earn five minutes.

40
00:01:46,450 --> 00:01:49,040
If they rip off the name tag
of somebody who has 90 minutes left,

41
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:51,380
Jae Suk and Jong Kook will lose...

42
00:01:51,380 --> 00:01:52,990
half of their respective
remaining times.

43
00:01:52,990 --> 00:01:56,060
It'll be a mess. You'll hold hands
and let go. This sounds fun.

44
00:01:56,060 --> 00:01:57,120
(This sounds fun.)

45
00:01:57,760 --> 00:02:00,150
(The oldest judge is left alone.)

46
00:02:00,150 --> 00:02:02,620
- Suk Jin.
- Why is the judge talking?

47
00:02:02,620 --> 00:02:04,200
- Don't pay any attention.
- What's wrong with him?

48
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:05,320
- Sir.
- Don't pay any attention.

49
00:02:05,320 --> 00:02:08,130
Your name tags are hidden
inside this building.

50
00:02:08,130 --> 00:02:10,370
If you collect two name tags
of the same person,

51
00:02:10,370 --> 00:02:12,710
their remaining time gets revealed.

52
00:02:13,430 --> 00:02:14,770
If you collect
two of your own name tags,

53
00:02:14,770 --> 00:02:17,150
you earn an additional 10 minutes.

54
00:02:17,150 --> 00:02:19,180
- That's good.
- Inside the building is...

55
00:02:19,180 --> 00:02:21,520
also the special Room of Time.

56
00:02:21,710 --> 00:02:24,920
Room of Time opens without notice
at random locations,

57
00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:26,750
and only one person can use it.

58
00:02:26,750 --> 00:02:28,860
It disappears after use.

59
00:02:28,860 --> 00:02:30,280
In order to use Room of Time,

60
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:32,620
you must pay a third of your
remaining time as the admission.

61
00:02:32,620 --> 00:02:33,690
My gosh.

62
00:02:33,690 --> 00:02:36,220
It's probably worth it though.

63
00:02:36,220 --> 00:02:38,120
(Current Time Status)

64
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:40,240
(Se Chan, Kyung-hwan, Han Na, Haha,
Ji Hyo, So Min, Jae Suk)

65
00:02:40,740 --> 00:02:43,270
There are targets beneath me.

66
00:02:43,270 --> 00:02:47,430
I don't have to worry about
Ji Hyo, Kwang Soo, and Jae Suk.

67
00:02:47,430 --> 00:02:49,610
The rest are tricky.

68
00:02:49,900 --> 00:02:54,340
I'm planning to be loyal to Se Chan.

69
00:02:54,340 --> 00:02:56,520
I think Haha took...

70
00:02:56,740 --> 00:02:58,490
Han Na's time
because she was on top.

71
00:02:58,490 --> 00:03:01,650
Jong Kook probably stole
Kyung-hwan's time.

72
00:03:01,650 --> 00:03:04,930
There's a possibility I might win...

73
00:03:04,930 --> 00:03:05,960
by default.

74
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:08,020
I'm either top 1 or 2.

75
00:03:08,020 --> 00:03:10,300
I'm sure
Kyung-hwan has more time than me.

76
00:03:10,830 --> 00:03:12,840
People who are
on a similar level as me...

77
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:15,460
are Han Na and Se Chan.

78
00:03:16,370 --> 00:03:20,900
Jong Kook probably has around
1 hour to 1 hour and 10 minutes.

79
00:03:20,900 --> 00:03:23,710
People know I have some time,

80
00:03:24,550 --> 00:03:26,710
so it won't be easy. Jae Suk first.

81
00:03:26,710 --> 00:03:28,080
(He's sure Jae Suk is the last.)

82
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:29,550
Jae Suk...

83
00:03:29,550 --> 00:03:30,550
(Jae Suk)

84
00:03:30,550 --> 00:03:32,210
Do you have a strategy?

85
00:03:32,210 --> 00:03:34,990
I have no strategy.

86
00:03:35,210 --> 00:03:37,180
I have to hold hands with somebody
before I die.

87
00:03:37,180 --> 00:03:39,120
I have to hold hands with Kwang Soo.

88
00:03:39,690 --> 00:03:42,120
5, 4,

89
00:03:42,370 --> 00:03:46,060
3, 2, 1.

90
00:03:46,060 --> 00:03:47,340
Start the race.

91
00:03:47,370 --> 00:03:48,460
I'm in trouble.

92
00:03:48,460 --> 00:03:49,610
(The countdown starts
with the race.)

93
00:03:49,610 --> 00:03:51,810
I have no time to waste.

94
00:03:52,140 --> 00:03:54,770
The race has begun.

95
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:56,340
(Jae Suk)

96
00:03:56,340 --> 00:03:59,240
Gosh, I have to hold
hands with someone.

97
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:01,620
Where's the entrance?

98
00:04:01,620 --> 00:04:03,840
(Jae Suk might become
a judge in 1 minute.)

99
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:06,920
(Jae Suk)

100
00:04:06,920 --> 00:04:07,960
Where are they?

101
00:04:08,650 --> 00:04:09,650
Han Na.

102
00:04:11,090 --> 00:04:12,690
- Han Na.
- Why?

103
00:04:12,690 --> 00:04:15,020
- Han Na. Hold my hand.
- Yes?

104
00:04:15,020 --> 00:04:17,330
- Why? What's going on?
- Please help me.

105
00:04:17,330 --> 00:04:18,430
What is going on?

106
00:04:18,430 --> 00:04:19,960
- Han Na.
- Let's go rip off a name tag.

107
00:04:19,960 --> 00:04:21,630
- That's right. You need me too.
- Okay.

108
00:04:21,630 --> 00:04:22,970
- Let's go.
- Cool.

109
00:04:22,970 --> 00:04:24,740
- There they are.
- Hang on.

110
00:04:24,970 --> 00:04:26,610
What? Are you two joining hands?

111
00:04:26,980 --> 00:04:29,640
It's no use joining hands when
both of you don't have much time.

112
00:04:29,640 --> 00:04:31,350
- That's not true.
- Don't listen to him.

113
00:04:31,350 --> 00:04:33,050
- We are rich.
- That's right.

114
00:04:33,050 --> 00:04:34,640
- We have plenty of time.
- We can win.

115
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:36,640
We will win
if they fight against them.

116
00:04:37,180 --> 00:04:38,490
- 10.
- What?

117
00:04:38,490 --> 00:04:40,160
- 9, 8,
- What's going on?

118
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:41,720
- Seven...
- I guess it's Jae Suk.

119
00:04:41,810 --> 00:04:43,320
We should find a name tag.

120
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:46,190
(Jae Suk has only 10 seconds left.)

121
00:04:46,190 --> 00:04:48,030
- How do we get to the 16th floor?
- 10, 9...

122
00:04:48,030 --> 00:04:49,620
- What's that?
- What?

123
00:04:49,690 --> 00:04:51,190
- Seven...
- We're holding hands.

124
00:04:51,190 --> 00:04:52,260
Six.

125
00:04:52,260 --> 00:04:53,370
- We joined hands together.
- Five.

126
00:04:53,370 --> 00:04:54,800
- Four.
- I'm holding her hand.

127
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:55,830
Three.

128
00:04:55,910 --> 00:04:57,740
- What?
- Jae Suk is out.

129
00:04:58,170 --> 00:05:00,040
I'm holding her hand though?

130
00:05:00,740 --> 00:05:02,850
(Yoo Jae Suk is out
in 1 minute and 40 seconds.)

131
00:05:02,850 --> 00:05:04,910
You should've
ripped off her name tag.

132
00:05:04,910 --> 00:05:05,920
Good one, Jae Suk.

133
00:05:08,370 --> 00:05:09,740
He's out.

134
00:05:09,740 --> 00:05:11,220
You're out.

135
00:05:11,810 --> 00:05:13,080
You're a judge now.

136
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:15,990
Holding hands doesn't work?
I had to rip off her name tag?

137
00:05:16,430 --> 00:05:19,430
I see. You found the wrong person.

138
00:05:19,430 --> 00:05:21,800
Yoo Jae Suk is out.

139
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:22,800
What?

140
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:24,730
(What? The race has just begun.)

141
00:05:25,100 --> 00:05:26,740
He's out for good?

142
00:05:28,100 --> 00:05:29,630
So it was true.

143
00:05:29,630 --> 00:05:31,560
He just showed
his real intention like that.

144
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,000
Gosh.

145
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,870
You look good in the uniform.

146
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:36,640
You look great.

147
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:38,280
Mind your own business.

148
00:05:38,280 --> 00:05:39,810
You look good.

149
00:05:39,810 --> 00:05:40,810
(Watching the judge)

150
00:05:40,810 --> 00:05:43,550
- You look good in yellow.
- Gosh.

151
00:05:43,550 --> 00:05:44,550
Where should I go now?

152
00:05:44,550 --> 00:05:47,010
Jae Suk,
another judge Suk Jin is...

153
00:05:47,010 --> 00:05:49,490
- now setting the Room of Secret.
- Okay.

154
00:05:49,490 --> 00:05:51,730
Once you go to him,
he will tell you what to do.

155
00:05:51,730 --> 00:05:53,100
Wait.

156
00:05:53,100 --> 00:05:54,890
Am I supposed to get
instructions from Suk Jin?

157
00:05:54,890 --> 00:05:57,470
Yes. Go ask Suk Jin
about what to do.

158
00:05:57,470 --> 00:05:59,100
Where is Suk Jin?

159
00:05:59,740 --> 00:06:01,990
- Hello?
- Where are you, Boss?

160
00:06:01,990 --> 00:06:03,910
- Are you out?
- Yes.

161
00:06:03,910 --> 00:06:05,170
I'm out of the race.

162
00:06:05,740 --> 00:06:08,110
- Come over here.
- Is it the 14th floor?

163
00:06:08,830 --> 00:06:12,350
Okay. I should go to the 14th floor.

164
00:06:13,310 --> 00:06:16,810
Hey. Will you hurry?

165
00:06:16,810 --> 00:06:20,010
(Suk Jin is acting
like an old fossil already.)

166
00:06:20,380 --> 00:06:22,220
Do you think this is a joke?

167
00:06:22,490 --> 00:06:25,450
Who told you to sit down?
Stand still there.

168
00:06:26,530 --> 00:06:27,930
My goodness.

169
00:06:28,490 --> 00:06:29,990
(The judge is slacking off already.)

170
00:06:29,990 --> 00:06:31,230
I can't believe this.

171
00:06:31,230 --> 00:06:33,100
- Hey.
- We're the same judge.

172
00:06:33,100 --> 00:06:34,990
I'm judge number one.

173
00:06:35,170 --> 00:06:36,260
I'm number two.

174
00:06:36,260 --> 00:06:37,870
You should organize these.

175
00:06:37,870 --> 00:06:39,480
- They're not organized.
- What should I do?

176
00:06:39,480 --> 00:06:40,980
You should organize
things like this.

177
00:06:41,930 --> 00:06:43,550
(He sets an example,
unlike his tone.)

178
00:06:43,550 --> 00:06:44,870
You can do that.

179
00:06:44,870 --> 00:06:47,440
We have to manage the Room of Time.

180
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:48,740
What?

181
00:06:49,990 --> 00:06:51,880
We are the managers
of the Room of Time.

182
00:06:52,790 --> 00:06:54,560
We're not supposed to loaf around.

183
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:55,860
I'm not loafing around.

184
00:06:55,860 --> 00:06:57,880
We have to manage the Room of Time.

185
00:06:57,930 --> 00:07:00,160
- They will be spinning a roulette.
- And?

186
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:01,530
And the time they have...

187
00:07:01,530 --> 00:07:02,800
- Hey.
- What?

188
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:04,170
I'm talking now.

189
00:07:04,230 --> 00:07:06,830
I'm just eating this while you talk.

190
00:07:06,830 --> 00:07:09,240
Put it down. I said put it down.

191
00:07:09,870 --> 00:07:11,500
Put it down or share it with me.

192
00:07:11,500 --> 00:07:12,830
(Intimidating)

193
00:07:13,370 --> 00:07:14,570
Thanks.

194
00:07:14,870 --> 00:07:16,310
We also...

195
00:07:16,310 --> 00:07:18,350
have to clean up the Room of Time.

196
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:19,810
That's your job.

197
00:07:20,350 --> 00:07:21,740
- Me?
- You should clean up the room.

198
00:07:21,740 --> 00:07:23,810
It's not like I became
number one for no reason.

199
00:07:23,810 --> 00:07:26,490
I used to serve
my seniors very well.

200
00:07:26,490 --> 00:07:30,430
I cleaned up
the Room of Time for five years.

201
00:07:31,750 --> 00:07:33,890
I've done it for a long time.

202
00:07:34,730 --> 00:07:36,730
Gosh. Who will be number three?

203
00:07:37,320 --> 00:07:38,620
Shall we catch Han Na?

204
00:07:39,260 --> 00:07:40,690
Shall we?

205
00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:43,670
- We can get half of her time.
- We can do that.

206
00:07:43,670 --> 00:07:45,980
We should go after Han Na...

207
00:07:46,070 --> 00:07:47,680
because she has just
as much time as me.

208
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:49,240
That's why I'm joining
hands with you.

209
00:07:49,980 --> 00:07:51,610
You can get some time
and I can get some too.

210
00:07:51,980 --> 00:07:53,240
Then you can...

211
00:07:53,370 --> 00:07:54,720
leave me right away.

212
00:07:55,070 --> 00:07:56,290
I'll catch you right away.

213
00:07:56,290 --> 00:07:57,990
(I will catch you
after catching Han Na.)

214
00:07:57,990 --> 00:07:59,720
(Kyung-hwan's ultimatum)

215
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:01,560
As soon as we catch Han Na,
you should run away.

216
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:02,860
Okay?

217
00:08:03,530 --> 00:08:05,660
- I don't know how I will change.
- I don't want to run away though.

218
00:08:05,660 --> 00:08:07,100
You have no choice. I'm a zombie.

219
00:08:07,430 --> 00:08:08,890
- You have to run away.
- Okay.

220
00:08:09,390 --> 00:08:11,470
(Haha and Ji Hyo meet secretly
with not much time.)

221
00:08:11,470 --> 00:08:13,490
- Ji Hyo.
- Yes?

222
00:08:13,490 --> 00:08:15,600
You're doing good with time, right?
She's safe, right?

223
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:17,630
- I'm doing okay.
- I know.

224
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,630
- I'm good.
- We both are from Mapo-gu.

225
00:08:20,810 --> 00:08:22,980
I think we should hold hands, right?

226
00:08:23,350 --> 00:08:26,180
(Right at the moment...)

227
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:27,680
There's Jong Kook.

228
00:08:28,420 --> 00:08:29,880
Let's go catch him.

229
00:08:29,880 --> 00:08:32,220
(Jong Kook, Ji Hyo,
Kyung-hwan, Haha)

230
00:08:32,220 --> 00:08:34,220
Haha has no time.

231
00:08:34,290 --> 00:08:35,450
He doesn't have much time.

232
00:08:35,790 --> 00:08:37,180
Haha doesn't have much time, right?

233
00:08:37,580 --> 00:08:38,850
Who is that?

234
00:08:38,980 --> 00:08:40,130
It's Kyung-hwan.

235
00:08:40,130 --> 00:08:42,450
- Even if they join hands...
- They can't beat us anyway.

236
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:44,630
Come here.

237
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:46,270
It's Kyung-hwan. We have to run.

238
00:08:46,270 --> 00:08:48,170
(It's Kyung-hwan and Jong Kook.
Run away!)

239
00:08:48,170 --> 00:08:49,510
Come over here.

240
00:08:49,510 --> 00:08:50,670
Bring the beggar.

241
00:08:50,670 --> 00:08:52,270
(The friends
from Mapo-gu scatter.)

242
00:08:53,510 --> 00:08:54,600
Stop.

243
00:08:55,410 --> 00:08:57,600
(He runs upstairs at full speed.)

244
00:08:58,570 --> 00:08:59,780
Did they leave?

245
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:02,470
(Snatching)

246
00:09:02,980 --> 00:09:05,980
Gosh, what was that?
Where were you?

247
00:09:05,980 --> 00:09:07,110
Hang on.

248
00:09:07,110 --> 00:09:08,310
(Jong Kook ripped off
Haha's name tag.)

249
00:09:08,310 --> 00:09:11,390
(If Jong Kook has more time than
Haha, he gets half of Haha's time.)

250
00:09:11,390 --> 00:09:13,090
The countdown is paused.

251
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:14,950
Did he follow me all the way?

252
00:09:14,950 --> 00:09:16,320
(Haha has quite a bit of time left.)

253
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:18,360
(What's the result?)

254
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:20,690
Haha lost half of his time.

255
00:09:20,690 --> 00:09:23,410
(Jong Kook stole
half of Haha's time.)

256
00:09:23,410 --> 00:09:24,460
Hang on.

257
00:09:24,460 --> 00:09:25,730
- Does he have more time than me?
- Yes.

258
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:29,310
Do you think I don't?

259
00:09:29,650 --> 00:09:31,010
I saw what you were doing.

260
00:09:31,700 --> 00:09:33,840
Okay. I don't know
how much time I've gathered.

261
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:35,180
(He worked really hard
to collect the time.)

262
00:09:37,110 --> 00:09:38,290
You should come to me.

263
00:09:38,420 --> 00:09:40,290
Kyung-hwan, you should come to me.

264
00:09:40,290 --> 00:09:42,210
- Kyung-hwan, join hands with me.
- What's going on here?

265
00:09:42,210 --> 00:09:44,390
Ji Hyo, you should
hold hands with me.

266
00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:45,950
Kwang Soo.

267
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:47,660
Why don't you come to me?

268
00:09:47,660 --> 00:09:48,950
If you and I work together...

269
00:09:49,670 --> 00:09:52,770
But I think it's either
Se Chan or Han Na who is leading.

270
00:09:52,770 --> 00:09:53,930
Gosh.

271
00:09:53,930 --> 00:09:55,300
I've always had a lot of time.

272
00:09:55,960 --> 00:09:58,330
Does Kyung-hwan have
a lot of time? I guess he does.

273
00:09:58,330 --> 00:09:59,600
This is the lobby.

274
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:01,600
We should take the elevator
and go upstairs first.

275
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:02,780
Let's take the elevator.

276
00:10:04,100 --> 00:10:05,410
We should go upstairs.

277
00:10:06,940 --> 00:10:07,970
Let's go after Kyung-hwan.

278
00:10:10,110 --> 00:10:11,210
Let's join hands together.

279
00:10:11,210 --> 00:10:12,290
Rip off Kyung-hwan's name tag.

280
00:10:12,980 --> 00:10:14,850
- Wait. I should be scared of him.
- Hurry.

281
00:10:15,520 --> 00:10:16,930
(He runs away immediately.)

282
00:10:16,930 --> 00:10:18,820
Se Chan is too strong.

283
00:10:19,430 --> 00:10:21,400
We should rip it off. Hurry.

284
00:10:21,400 --> 00:10:22,500
(Kyung-hwan gets cold feet
and runs away.)

285
00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:23,670
I can't do this.

286
00:10:24,530 --> 00:10:27,430
(Did he grab
Kyung-hwan's name tag?)

287
00:10:28,190 --> 00:10:30,810
(But he missed the big fish
by a second.)

288
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:34,230
(The chase continues.)

289
00:10:34,230 --> 00:10:35,830
Jong Kook.

290
00:10:35,830 --> 00:10:37,010
- Come here.
- Hurry.

291
00:10:37,010 --> 00:10:38,570
(Kyung-hwan and Jong Kook
are joining hands together.)

292
00:10:39,050 --> 00:10:42,440
(The situation has turned
in their favor now.)

293
00:10:42,680 --> 00:10:44,180
Run. Hurry.

294
00:10:45,080 --> 00:10:46,680
- Go away.
- Grab her.

295
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:47,850
Get her name tag.

296
00:10:48,710 --> 00:10:50,890
We don't know yet. Just rip it off.

297
00:10:51,060 --> 00:10:53,660
We need one more person.
Kwang Soo, come over here.

298
00:10:53,660 --> 00:10:56,820
- Come here.
- Go to Kwang Soo.

299
00:10:56,930 --> 00:10:59,090
Join hands with Kwang Soo.

300
00:10:59,190 --> 00:11:00,270
I did it.

301
00:11:00,330 --> 00:11:02,860
(He ripped off Se Chan's name tag.)

302
00:11:02,860 --> 00:11:04,140
- I took it off.
- We did it.

303
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:05,410
Who ripped whose name tag?

304
00:11:05,410 --> 00:11:06,430
Jong Kook and Kyung-hwan...

305
00:11:06,430 --> 00:11:08,380
ripped off Se Chan
and Ji Hyo's name tags.

306
00:11:08,380 --> 00:11:09,410
- Gosh, it hurts.
- Okay.

307
00:11:09,410 --> 00:11:10,650
I don't know who will win.

308
00:11:10,910 --> 00:11:13,680
- Se Chan got 100 minutes earlier.
- I know.

309
00:11:13,750 --> 00:11:14,970
I have more time than you think.

310
00:11:15,880 --> 00:11:18,520
How much time do I lose
if he has more than me?

311
00:11:18,580 --> 00:11:20,810
- Is it half?
- I can't tell you that now.

312
00:11:21,710 --> 00:11:24,580
(Whoever wins, the losing team
will lose more than an hour.)

313
00:11:24,580 --> 00:11:28,260
(Who is losing their time?)

314
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:30,460
Anyway,

315
00:11:30,530 --> 00:11:31,800
Kyung-hwan and Jong Kook
get more time.

316
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:33,000
We won!

317
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,690
(Kyung-hwan and Jong Kook
get more time.)

318
00:11:35,590 --> 00:11:36,770
This is amazing.

319
00:11:36,770 --> 00:11:38,960
(How much time
does Jong Kook have then?)

320
00:11:39,570 --> 00:11:42,430
(Jong Kook picked the phone
that was left.)

321
00:11:42,570 --> 00:11:44,100
Is it number five? Okay.

322
00:11:44,100 --> 00:11:45,200
(Luckily, he got
2 hours and 50 minutes.)

323
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:46,340
The last one.

324
00:11:47,340 --> 00:11:49,050
(He has had a lot of time
from the beginning.)

325
00:11:49,050 --> 00:11:51,150
(And he got only good ones
from spinning the roulette.)

326
00:11:51,150 --> 00:11:52,710
(Steal 20 minutes and the invested
time from the top 1)

327
00:11:52,710 --> 00:11:56,290
(That's how
the time monster was born.)

328
00:11:56,630 --> 00:11:59,290
(But he doesn't even know
that he has a lot of time.)

329
00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:00,530
Kyung-hwan and Jong Kook
get more time.

330
00:12:00,530 --> 00:12:01,760
We won!

331
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:02,960
- Really?
- This is amazing.

332
00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:05,130
(Se Chan and Ji Hyo
lost their time.)

333
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,500
- Gosh, Jong Kook.
- Hey.

334
00:12:07,670 --> 00:12:08,860
You should be nice to me.

335
00:12:08,930 --> 00:12:10,410
Thank you, Jong Kook. Just go.

336
00:12:10,410 --> 00:12:12,600
- That's not what I meant.
- Just go.

337
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:14,140
Thank you.

338
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:17,180
Don't rip off my name tag then.
Leave me alone until the end.

339
00:12:17,180 --> 00:12:18,940
I told you.
I got bitten by a zombie.

340
00:12:19,310 --> 00:12:20,780
- I will change soon.
- What?

341
00:12:21,110 --> 00:12:22,380
I helped you.

342
00:12:22,380 --> 00:12:23,680
I won't rip off your name tag.

343
00:12:23,980 --> 00:12:25,520
But you should go
stand on your own feet.

344
00:12:25,520 --> 00:12:27,290
- Leave me.
- I know.

345
00:12:27,310 --> 00:12:30,130
I will see you at the top.

346
00:12:30,130 --> 00:12:31,820
(They promise to meet at the top.)

347
00:12:32,130 --> 00:12:35,760
(Current Time Status)

348
00:12:36,060 --> 00:12:37,400
(At the moment,
in the judges' office)

349
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:39,220
- I shouldn't be here now.
- Who ripped off your name tag?

350
00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:41,190
I just ran out of time.

351
00:12:41,560 --> 00:12:44,600
- I had only about two minutes.
- You ran out of time.

352
00:12:45,170 --> 00:12:47,640
There will be more members
coming in here soon.

353
00:12:48,700 --> 00:12:51,680
There will be more judges
than members later.

354
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:53,780
Judge number 1 and 2.

355
00:12:53,780 --> 00:12:56,290
Please move
to the first Room of Secret.

356
00:12:56,290 --> 00:12:58,150
Once you get there,
we will announce...

357
00:12:58,150 --> 00:13:00,180
that the first
Room of Secret is open.

358
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:01,890
Who will be the main judge?

359
00:13:01,890 --> 00:13:03,630
- I'm the main judge.
- I see.

360
00:13:03,630 --> 00:13:05,890
It depends on who works better.

361
00:13:06,930 --> 00:13:08,190
Go open the door.

362
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:11,320
Make it say it's open.

363
00:13:11,860 --> 00:13:12,960
Hey, Judge number two.

364
00:13:12,960 --> 00:13:14,060
(Yelling)

365
00:13:14,270 --> 00:13:15,640
Flip it, so it says it's open.

366
00:13:15,640 --> 00:13:17,040
(While Judge No. 1
yells at Judge No. 2,)

367
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:18,100
Good.

368
00:13:18,100 --> 00:13:19,570
(Room of Time has opened.)

369
00:13:19,570 --> 00:13:23,150
(Room of Time opens without notice
in random locations.)

370
00:13:23,150 --> 00:13:26,810
(Only one person can use it.
And it disappears after use.)

371
00:13:26,810 --> 00:13:30,680
(They pay a third of their remaining
time as the admission fee.)

372
00:13:30,680 --> 00:13:32,020
The first Room of Time is open.

373
00:13:32,020 --> 00:13:33,210
The Room of Time is open.

374
00:13:33,390 --> 00:13:34,950
- Room of Time.
- I need to go there.

375
00:13:34,950 --> 00:13:36,950
You should go there
and bet your life.

376
00:13:36,950 --> 00:13:38,180
Where's the Room of Time?

377
00:13:38,890 --> 00:13:41,590
I have to go to the Room of Time.
I need to go there.

378
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:43,270
Do I just look for the Room of Time?

379
00:13:43,270 --> 00:13:45,720
(Kwang Soo)

380
00:13:45,720 --> 00:13:47,270
I will be doomed without it.

381
00:13:47,270 --> 00:13:48,270
(Who will be the first member
to use Room of Time?)

382
00:13:48,270 --> 00:13:49,810
I should go to the Room of Time.

383
00:13:50,510 --> 00:13:52,330
It's down there. It's open.

384
00:13:54,570 --> 00:13:56,200
It's open now.

385
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:58,280
Jae Suk. Judge.

386
00:13:58,380 --> 00:13:59,610
Hey, it's open.

387
00:14:00,340 --> 00:14:01,440
Hurry.

388
00:14:01,610 --> 00:14:02,750
It's me.

389
00:14:02,890 --> 00:14:04,050
Hang on.

390
00:14:04,610 --> 00:14:06,480
- It costs a third of your time.
- Okay. I'll pay.

391
00:14:06,520 --> 00:14:08,810
- You should pay more than that.
- What? Why?

392
00:14:08,810 --> 00:14:10,180
(I've never seen a judge like him.)

393
00:14:10,180 --> 00:14:11,790
(It's a collaboration
of threat and intimidation.)

394
00:14:11,790 --> 00:14:12,950
You should pay half of what you got.

395
00:14:13,350 --> 00:14:14,500
Why?

396
00:14:14,500 --> 00:14:15,800
- Get in.
- You're the judges.

397
00:14:15,800 --> 00:14:16,960
- Go in.
- Okay.

398
00:14:17,220 --> 00:14:19,000
- I will pay a third of my time.
- Hey, wait.

399
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,360
Spin it in front of us. We're bored.

400
00:14:22,360 --> 00:14:23,700
- Now.
- Move.

401
00:14:23,700 --> 00:14:26,010
- Can they do that?
- I'm Judge No. 1.

402
00:14:26,010 --> 00:14:28,040
- Why are you being like this?
- Just spin it.

403
00:14:28,040 --> 00:14:30,440
(He pays 10 minutes
as the admission fee.)

404
00:14:30,910 --> 00:14:32,050
Gosh.

405
00:14:32,380 --> 00:14:35,150
(Will Haha be able to make
a big fortune with a spin?)

406
00:14:35,150 --> 00:14:37,050
Let's see what he gets.

407
00:14:37,050 --> 00:14:38,890
Steal half of the time
from a person chosen randomly.

408
00:14:39,390 --> 00:14:40,850
- Please.
- We have to keep watch.

409
00:14:40,850 --> 00:14:42,680
Switching time is the best one.

410
00:14:42,680 --> 00:14:43,930
- Right.
- Go ahead.

411
00:14:43,930 --> 00:14:46,400
I want switch time with a person
of your choice. Please.

412
00:14:46,500 --> 00:14:47,820
You have only one chance.

413
00:14:47,930 --> 00:14:49,450
- Please.
- It's the dud.

414
00:14:52,060 --> 00:14:57,410
(What's the result of the roulette?)

415
00:14:58,010 --> 00:14:59,230
It's a dud.

416
00:14:59,230 --> 00:15:01,310
(Switch time
with a person of your choice)

417
00:15:01,310 --> 00:15:02,600
- Okay!
- Seriously?

418
00:15:04,150 --> 00:15:06,780
(He managed to get "Switch time
with a person of your choice.")

419
00:15:06,780 --> 00:15:09,980
Okay!

420
00:15:09,980 --> 00:15:11,810
- Okay.
- You're so lucky.

421
00:15:11,810 --> 00:15:13,390
- Who would you like to switch with?
- Me?

422
00:15:13,980 --> 00:15:15,350
I think Kyung-hwan
has a lot of time.

423
00:15:15,350 --> 00:15:18,950
Han Na has more time. She took
1 hour and 50 minutes from me.

424
00:15:19,630 --> 00:15:20,720
- Kang Han Na.
- Kang Han Na.

425
00:15:20,930 --> 00:15:23,000
- Han Na is in trouble.
- I feel bad for her.

426
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,300
I'm sorry, Han Na.

427
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:25,800
Han Na, I will help you.

428
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:27,140
Gosh, Han Na.

429
00:15:27,190 --> 00:15:28,730
I'm so glad that you picked Han Na.

430
00:15:28,730 --> 00:15:31,410
(Haha switched time with Han Na.)

431
00:15:31,410 --> 00:15:32,830
(It's done!)

432
00:15:32,830 --> 00:15:34,010
Hey, the five of you!

433
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:36,310
I'm in the lobby.

434
00:15:36,310 --> 00:15:38,680
(He finally straightens up his
shoulders and raises his voice.)

435
00:15:38,680 --> 00:15:41,150
(He forgets about the past
and becomes triumphant.)

436
00:15:41,150 --> 00:15:42,550
That doesn't make sense.

437
00:15:42,840 --> 00:15:44,390
In Room of Time,

438
00:15:44,390 --> 00:15:47,480
Haha switched his time...

439
00:15:47,480 --> 00:15:49,210
with yours.

440
00:15:49,210 --> 00:15:51,180
(Shocked)

441
00:15:51,180 --> 00:15:53,190
- How much time do I have?
- Now you have...

442
00:15:53,190 --> 00:15:55,500
18 minutes and 47 seconds.

443
00:15:55,500 --> 00:15:57,670
(Han Na)

444
00:15:57,670 --> 00:15:58,820
Haha!

445
00:15:59,690 --> 00:16:01,230
Han Na, hello.

446
00:16:01,230 --> 00:16:02,860
- You...
- I can't believe this.

447
00:16:03,540 --> 00:16:04,700
What do I do?

448
00:16:04,700 --> 00:16:06,880
(Han Na has become
a timeless beggar in an instant.)

449
00:16:07,180 --> 00:16:08,330
What do I do?

450
00:16:09,750 --> 00:16:10,880
Why?

451
00:16:11,250 --> 00:16:12,340
What?

452
00:16:12,810 --> 00:16:16,020
Why are you following me
around the whole time?

453
00:16:16,180 --> 00:16:18,080
Let's end things
for those with little time.

454
00:16:18,080 --> 00:16:19,390
I'll hold your hand.

455
00:16:19,390 --> 00:16:20,850
(The zombie is putting on airs.)

456
00:16:20,850 --> 00:16:22,480
- I'm helping you this once.
- Thank you.

457
00:16:22,920 --> 00:16:23,980
Now...

458
00:16:24,430 --> 00:16:25,630
To be honest,

459
00:16:25,790 --> 00:16:27,590
there's something you need
to tell me.

460
00:16:27,590 --> 00:16:28,630
(He talks
in a condescending manner.)

461
00:16:28,630 --> 00:16:29,820
Tell me how much time you have.

462
00:16:30,770 --> 00:16:34,000
Because I can assure you,
you can't beat me.

463
00:16:35,060 --> 00:16:36,140
How much time do you have?

464
00:16:36,960 --> 00:16:38,040
20 minutes.

465
00:16:38,330 --> 00:16:39,810
You're so poor.

466
00:16:40,280 --> 00:16:42,200
Gosh, she's dirt poor.

467
00:16:42,640 --> 00:16:43,910
Are you serious?

468
00:16:44,650 --> 00:16:45,840
You'll die out on your own.

469
00:16:46,280 --> 00:16:47,470
Hold on.

470
00:16:47,570 --> 00:16:49,250
Hey, hey. Come here.

471
00:16:49,250 --> 00:16:50,580
(They meet Kwang Soo and Se Chan.)

472
00:16:50,580 --> 00:16:51,650
Hold on a minute.

473
00:16:52,250 --> 00:16:54,020
This is tricky.

474
00:16:54,020 --> 00:16:55,160
This is.

475
00:16:55,160 --> 00:16:57,530
Se Chan, you lost
half of your time, right?

476
00:16:57,720 --> 00:16:58,790
Yes.

477
00:16:58,790 --> 00:17:00,820
Okay, and you haven't gotten
attacked, right?

478
00:17:01,190 --> 00:17:04,030
- Right.
- Ji Hyo, listen to me.

479
00:17:04,670 --> 00:17:05,800
We're going to save you.

480
00:17:05,800 --> 00:17:07,560
Join hands with us
and let's eliminate him.

481
00:17:07,560 --> 00:17:09,660
(Join hands with us
and let's eliminate him.)

482
00:17:09,770 --> 00:17:12,560
(He wants to join hands with her.)

483
00:17:12,560 --> 00:17:13,600
What do you say?

484
00:17:14,330 --> 00:17:15,830
Forget about him. He's just a guest.

485
00:17:15,830 --> 00:17:17,550
- That's right.
- Let the members become one.

486
00:17:18,280 --> 00:17:20,050
- Let's show him.
- He's a mere guest.

487
00:17:20,050 --> 00:17:21,220
(When things are rough,
they always say this.)

488
00:17:21,220 --> 00:17:22,840
(Should I or should I not?)

489
00:17:22,840 --> 00:17:25,610
During my entire time here,
this is the moment...

490
00:17:25,610 --> 00:17:27,310
when they've looked
the least confident.

491
00:17:27,310 --> 00:17:29,560
- I'm serious.
- He does have a lot of time.

492
00:17:29,560 --> 00:17:31,530
- He does. We might not beat him.
- We might not beat him.

493
00:17:31,530 --> 00:17:34,150
But still, let's beat
our guest for today.

494
00:17:34,460 --> 00:17:36,120
No. Don't forget our promise.

495
00:17:36,120 --> 00:17:38,320
- Hey.
- Let's beat them...

496
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:40,040
- Hear me out.
- and survive.

497
00:17:40,040 --> 00:17:41,060
Many drops make a shower.

498
00:17:41,060 --> 00:17:42,830
Will you also be willing to save me?

499
00:17:42,970 --> 00:17:45,770
If you do, I'll let go of his hand
and join you.

500
00:17:46,570 --> 00:17:49,950
(During the critical time,
he betrays his own member.)

501
00:17:50,840 --> 00:17:53,610
Get him! Get him!

502
00:17:53,610 --> 00:17:55,610
- You little...
- Eliminate him!

503
00:17:55,610 --> 00:17:57,340
We'll win for sure.

504
00:17:57,910 --> 00:17:59,850
You jerks!

505
00:18:00,020 --> 00:18:03,260
From the way I see it,
you'll look better in yellow.

506
00:18:03,260 --> 00:18:04,580
He looks pathetic.

507
00:18:04,580 --> 00:18:06,230
(Kwang Soo, Kyung-hwan,
and Ji Hyo receive 7 minutes each.)

508
00:18:06,230 --> 00:18:07,320
Anyway...

509
00:18:07,320 --> 00:18:08,760
Please give us our minutes...

510
00:18:08,820 --> 00:18:10,120
- and let's go.
- How much time do I have left?

511
00:18:10,120 --> 00:18:13,090
(Se Chan)

512
00:18:13,090 --> 00:18:14,830
Hey, I still have some time.

513
00:18:15,160 --> 00:18:16,330
Me too.

514
00:18:16,710 --> 00:18:18,310
Do you three want to try
eliminating me?

515
00:18:18,810 --> 00:18:20,440
- Do you have that much?
- How much will that be?

516
00:18:20,440 --> 00:18:22,070
- What?
- Try it.

517
00:18:22,070 --> 00:18:23,670
You want us three
to try eliminating you?

518
00:18:24,250 --> 00:18:25,670
Give me a chance.

519
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:27,340
If you join me,
I'll eliminate him myself.

520
00:18:27,340 --> 00:18:28,870
He probably has about three minutes.

521
00:18:29,050 --> 00:18:31,410
I've never been this laidback
while on this show.

522
00:18:31,790 --> 00:18:33,410
- He looks awesome.
- We can beat him.

523
00:18:35,290 --> 00:18:36,730
(They grab Kyung-hwan.)

524
00:18:36,730 --> 00:18:38,350
(They rip his name tag.)

525
00:18:39,560 --> 00:18:43,230
(The three confidently remove
Kyung-hwan's name tag.)

526
00:18:44,300 --> 00:18:45,390
You made a mistake.

527
00:18:45,660 --> 00:18:47,390
- No, I doubt it.
- I know two of your times.

528
00:18:47,500 --> 00:18:49,740
- Let me calculate it.
- Come here.

529
00:18:49,740 --> 00:18:51,240
- Let's calculate this.
- They ganged up on me.

530
00:18:52,060 --> 00:18:53,310
I'm speechless.

531
00:18:53,310 --> 00:18:54,830
- What is it?
- That was intentional, right?

532
00:18:55,130 --> 00:18:57,070
- That was, right?
- No.

533
00:18:57,140 --> 00:18:59,050
I shouldn't have joined hands.

534
00:18:59,050 --> 00:19:02,450
It feels like three kids
have punched Fyodor in the back.

535
00:19:03,220 --> 00:19:05,520
No, we have enough time.

536
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:07,760
If he gets our time,
nobody will be able to beat him.

537
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:09,380
Tell us. Who lost?

538
00:19:09,380 --> 00:19:12,320
(What is the result?)

539
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:13,700
Kyung-hwan lost.

540
00:19:13,700 --> 00:19:14,760
- Okay!
- What?

541
00:19:15,920 --> 00:19:18,160
(He loses 1 hour and 25 minutes.)

542
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:19,590
All right, then.

543
00:19:19,590 --> 00:19:20,970
Hold on.

544
00:19:21,860 --> 00:19:22,860
I lost?

545
00:19:23,130 --> 00:19:25,010
(Ji Hyo: 23 minutes,
Se Chan: 17 minutes,)

546
00:19:25,010 --> 00:19:26,870
(Kyung-hwan:
2 hours and 50 minutes)

547
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:30,340
(So how much time
does Kwang Soo have?)

548
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:32,550
Han Na.

549
00:19:32,550 --> 00:19:33,980
- Yes?
- I lost?

550
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:35,840
- Kwang Soo.
- Yes?

551
00:19:36,250 --> 00:19:38,340
(While Kwang Soo is distracted,)

552
00:19:39,190 --> 00:19:41,380
(Se Chan gives Kyung-hwan a sign.)

553
00:19:42,580 --> 00:19:45,120
(And the four team up.)

554
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:46,150
Hurry!

555
00:19:46,490 --> 00:19:48,760
- Hurry! Rip it!
- I did it!

556
00:19:49,800 --> 00:19:51,000
(In a blink of an eye,)

557
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:52,970
(they remove Kwang Soo's name tag.)

558
00:19:52,970 --> 00:19:53,970
I did it!

559
00:19:53,970 --> 00:19:55,560
(He falls.)

560
00:19:55,560 --> 00:19:57,160
They were calculating our times.

561
00:19:57,160 --> 00:19:59,310
Come on. Hey!

562
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:00,900
We got his name tag.

563
00:20:00,900 --> 00:20:02,070
- They were calculating our times.
- We did it.

564
00:20:02,070 --> 00:20:03,570
- No.
- Hey!

565
00:20:03,570 --> 00:20:05,310
- They already finished.
- They finished.

566
00:20:05,310 --> 00:20:06,670
- They were calculating.
- They finished.

567
00:20:06,670 --> 00:20:07,810
They were calculating.

568
00:20:07,810 --> 00:20:09,370
- They finished.
- They finished.

569
00:20:09,370 --> 00:20:10,610
- Wait.
- We know you've lost.

570
00:20:10,610 --> 00:20:12,080
We know you've lost.

571
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:15,110
They're so inhumane. Okay.

572
00:20:15,110 --> 00:20:16,380
We four joined hands.

573
00:20:16,380 --> 00:20:17,420
- It was us four.
- It was.

574
00:20:17,420 --> 00:20:20,850
Kyung-hwan, Ji Hyo,
Se Chan, and Han Na...

575
00:20:21,090 --> 00:20:22,920
- eliminated Kwang Soo.
- Yes.

576
00:20:23,270 --> 00:20:26,500
(Their times put together
is about 3 hours and 16 minutes.)

577
00:20:27,240 --> 00:20:31,270
(He needs to have more than that
in order to not getting deducted.)

578
00:20:31,270 --> 00:20:32,860
Since Kwang Soo had more time...

579
00:20:32,860 --> 00:20:33,870
- Okay!
- What?

580
00:20:35,130 --> 00:20:38,210
(Does he have more time
than the four put together?)

581
00:20:38,210 --> 00:20:39,310
Wait. Seriously?

582
00:20:39,310 --> 00:20:41,220
- That's impossible. How?
- Come here.

583
00:20:41,220 --> 00:20:42,310
- All of you.
- Wait.

584
00:20:42,310 --> 00:20:43,550
- How much did you have?
- Come here, all of you.

585
00:20:43,550 --> 00:20:45,050
- Stand up.
- Hold on.

586
00:20:45,050 --> 00:20:46,580
(How much time did he have?)

587
00:20:46,760 --> 00:20:48,650
I don't have that much time.

588
00:20:49,350 --> 00:20:52,320
(He acted as if he didn't have
much time from the beginning.)

589
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:55,390
(How much time did his phone have?)

590
00:20:55,960 --> 00:21:01,240
(Kwang Soo)

591
00:21:01,300 --> 00:21:04,540
In the beginning,
I was pretty sure I came first.

592
00:21:06,060 --> 00:21:07,480
There are three cameras
following him.

593
00:21:08,280 --> 00:21:09,870
Since there are these many cameras,

594
00:21:10,810 --> 00:21:12,840
I feel like I could eliminate
just about everyone today.

595
00:21:12,840 --> 00:21:14,870
They give me such confidence
and strength.

596
00:21:15,570 --> 00:21:16,910
They really do.

597
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:19,750
Gosh.

598
00:21:20,560 --> 00:21:21,810
I must win today.

599
00:21:23,260 --> 00:21:25,560
(How dare you join hands
behind my back?)

600
00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:27,350
- Stand up.
- Hold on.

601
00:21:27,350 --> 00:21:28,820
- Will you not listen to me?
- Seriously?

602
00:21:28,820 --> 00:21:30,230
- Will you not?
- I'll stand up first.

603
00:21:30,230 --> 00:21:31,660
- You're first. Who's next?
- Me.

604
00:21:31,660 --> 00:21:32,920
- Who's third?
- Me.

605
00:21:32,920 --> 00:21:34,560
Come here.

606
00:21:34,560 --> 00:21:35,740
Hold on.

607
00:21:35,740 --> 00:21:36,830
You've been acting up.

608
00:21:36,830 --> 00:21:37,940
- That's not it.
- Okay?

609
00:21:37,940 --> 00:21:39,710
- I was telling you the truth.
- You've been acting up.

610
00:21:39,710 --> 00:21:41,240
Are you sure
you calculated correctly?

611
00:21:41,240 --> 00:21:42,710
Han Na and I joined hands.

612
00:21:42,710 --> 00:21:43,950
Those who need to go, go.

613
00:21:43,950 --> 00:21:46,340
I bet you two will be wearing yellow
sooner than later.

614
00:21:46,570 --> 00:21:48,140
- What did you say?
- It was Se Chan.

615
00:21:48,140 --> 00:21:49,480
He schemed this.

616
00:21:49,480 --> 00:21:51,790
- Let's go.
- Try me.

617
00:21:51,790 --> 00:21:53,410
You're so rich.

618
00:21:53,720 --> 00:21:55,350
- You have so much time.
- Come on.

619
00:21:55,350 --> 00:21:58,060
- I had no intention of doing that.
- Han Na.

620
00:21:58,060 --> 00:21:59,960
- How is this possible?
- He must have about four hours.

621
00:21:59,960 --> 00:22:01,390
It's more than that.

622
00:22:01,500 --> 00:22:03,890
Kwang Soo was deceiving us
all along.

623
00:22:04,030 --> 00:22:05,530
They're having a conflict.

624
00:22:05,530 --> 00:22:06,620
(Haha has been watching.)

625
00:22:06,620 --> 00:22:07,890
Who got eliminated?

626
00:22:08,740 --> 00:22:11,040
Hey, you keep wandering around us.

627
00:22:11,040 --> 00:22:12,400
Be quiet.

628
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:14,440
- Just leave.
- We're playing here. Leave.

629
00:22:14,440 --> 00:22:16,510
- We're also part of it.
- Go away.

630
00:22:16,510 --> 00:22:17,950
- Go.
- They're...

631
00:22:17,950 --> 00:22:20,250
- Why are you here?
- They're having a conflict.

632
00:22:20,250 --> 00:22:21,310
Go.

633
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:23,220
- Go.
- I'm playing the game!

634
00:22:23,220 --> 00:22:24,580
Go away.

635
00:22:25,290 --> 00:22:27,150
- Go.
- I'm playing the game.

636
00:22:27,150 --> 00:22:29,080
Don't be ridiculous. Just go.

637
00:22:29,080 --> 00:22:30,820
Don't trespass our area. Go away.

638
00:22:30,820 --> 00:22:33,150
This is so irritating.

639
00:22:33,150 --> 00:22:34,850
Go away.

640
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:37,970
I know you just want to get
to the Room of Time first.

641
00:22:38,360 --> 00:22:39,470
Just go!

642
00:22:39,890 --> 00:22:41,800
How much time do I have?

643
00:22:42,470 --> 00:22:43,860
I think I might die
while walking around.

644
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:46,100
(Let's eliminate him.)

645
00:22:46,100 --> 00:22:47,630
- He's nothing.
- I think I might die...

646
00:22:47,630 --> 00:22:48,810
Let's just do it.

647
00:22:50,600 --> 00:22:51,950
(They rip off his name tag.)

648
00:22:51,950 --> 00:22:53,070
She wanted me to do it.

649
00:22:53,980 --> 00:22:57,220
(Kyung-hwan and Ji Hyo
successfully eliminate Se Chan.)

650
00:22:57,690 --> 00:23:00,260
Why would you eliminate
a small fry like me?

651
00:23:00,260 --> 00:23:02,410
- She wanted me to.
- I'm just a small fry.

652
00:23:02,490 --> 00:23:04,080
- Ji Hyo wanted me to.
- What were you expecting?

653
00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:07,460
Since you were going to die anyway,
we wanted to speed that up.

654
00:23:07,460 --> 00:23:08,530
Okay.

655
00:23:08,730 --> 00:23:10,620
She said, "Let's eliminate him."

656
00:23:10,620 --> 00:23:12,500
My name tag got ripped off
so many times. Fine, keep going.

657
00:23:12,500 --> 00:23:14,360
- You may go now.
- I'll be going now.

658
00:23:14,500 --> 00:23:15,970
Please bring a camera over here.

659
00:23:16,860 --> 00:23:18,830
- Over here.
- Why?

660
00:23:18,830 --> 00:23:21,480
- You should shoot me flipping this.
- Don't give it to him.

661
00:23:21,480 --> 00:23:23,240
(He wants to have
his own screen time.)

662
00:23:23,240 --> 00:23:24,450
The Room of Time is open.

663
00:23:25,950 --> 00:23:27,050
(I got my own screen time.)

664
00:23:27,570 --> 00:23:29,610
- The second Room of Time is open.
- What?

665
00:23:29,610 --> 00:23:30,610
Isn't it over there?

666
00:23:30,610 --> 00:23:32,050
(So Min immediately begins
searching for it.)

667
00:23:32,050 --> 00:23:33,290
Is that open?

668
00:23:33,290 --> 00:23:34,380
Or is it locked?

669
00:23:34,380 --> 00:23:35,410
Is it open?

670
00:23:35,410 --> 00:23:37,760
- It's not this one.
- That one's closed.

671
00:23:38,380 --> 00:23:40,420
The second Room of Time is open.

672
00:23:41,030 --> 00:23:42,560
(Haha already knows where it is.)

673
00:23:42,560 --> 00:23:43,700
It's Haha again.

674
00:23:43,700 --> 00:23:45,000
(He arrives at the Room of Time.)

675
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:46,620
- He knew we were here.
- You can't come here.

676
00:23:46,620 --> 00:23:47,860
- Why not?
- You can't.

677
00:23:47,860 --> 00:23:50,270
- No, you should leave.
- You need to leave.

678
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:52,900
- You've already entered it once.
- You can't go again.

679
00:23:52,900 --> 00:23:54,670
What kind of rule is that?

680
00:23:54,670 --> 00:23:56,170
- Go away.
- This is my only hope.

681
00:23:56,170 --> 00:23:57,400
- No.
- Try going in there.

682
00:23:57,400 --> 00:23:58,810
- You've already done it.
- You can't.

683
00:23:58,810 --> 00:24:00,410
Everyone is given equal opportunity.

684
00:24:00,410 --> 00:24:01,480
- No.
- No.

685
00:24:01,480 --> 00:24:02,670
- It's based on what we want.
- There's no re-entry?

686
00:24:02,670 --> 00:24:04,380
We're in charge of this,
and we say no.

687
00:24:04,380 --> 00:24:06,110
- There are rules to this.
- No.

688
00:24:06,110 --> 00:24:07,490
There are none. Leave.

689
00:24:08,580 --> 00:24:10,260
- I have no hope right now.
- Leave.

690
00:24:10,260 --> 00:24:12,030
Don't be ridiculous.
You're in first place.

691
00:24:12,030 --> 00:24:13,530
I'm not.

692
00:24:13,530 --> 00:24:14,850
What do you get if you win?

693
00:24:15,590 --> 00:24:17,000
- What do you get?
- It's something good.

694
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:18,030
- I'll split it with you guys.
- Will you split it?

695
00:24:18,030 --> 00:24:19,030
Trust me.

696
00:24:19,030 --> 00:24:21,360
- You'll split it into three?
- Yes, I will.

697
00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:23,270
- Trust me.
- He may...

698
00:24:23,270 --> 00:24:25,630
He may be easily convinced,
but not me.

699
00:24:25,740 --> 00:24:27,070
This is my place.

700
00:24:27,070 --> 00:24:29,100
- What do you mean?
- You're my junior.

701
00:24:29,100 --> 00:24:30,600
- Get out.
- I'm your senior.

702
00:24:30,600 --> 00:24:32,600
I don't get why I can't go inside.

703
00:24:32,600 --> 00:24:34,720
You were acting sly
by roaming around this area.

704
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:36,280
I wasn't being sly! I was watching
the conflict down there!

705
00:24:36,280 --> 00:24:37,450
You disturbed me!

706
00:24:37,450 --> 00:24:39,910
- The Room of Time is here!
- Get out.

707
00:24:39,910 --> 00:24:41,490
Come on.

708
00:24:41,580 --> 00:24:42,580
Get out!

709
00:24:42,580 --> 00:24:43,820
- Hey.
- Get out! Okay, I'm in.

710
00:24:44,030 --> 00:24:45,790
One-third of your time
has been taken.

711
00:24:45,790 --> 00:24:46,920
- One-third?
- One-third?

712
00:24:46,920 --> 00:24:48,230
- Is he inside?
- All right.

713
00:24:48,230 --> 00:24:49,320
Is he inside?

714
00:24:49,320 --> 00:24:51,270
- You should've hurried.
- You should've.

715
00:24:51,270 --> 00:24:52,500
We were stopping him.

716
00:24:52,500 --> 00:24:53,560
He just went inside.

717
00:24:53,560 --> 00:24:54,970
- All right.
- Spin the roulette just once.

718
00:24:54,970 --> 00:24:57,130
- I want my time to double.
- Spin it.

719
00:24:57,130 --> 00:24:59,360
(Haha spins the roulette.)

720
00:25:00,630 --> 00:25:01,670
(Which outcome will he receive?)

721
00:25:01,670 --> 00:25:03,330
This way, I have hope.

722
00:25:03,330 --> 00:25:05,280
(Switch time with a person
of your choice.)

723
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:06,450
- "Switch time..."
- That's it.

724
00:25:06,450 --> 00:25:07,610
"with a person of your choice."

725
00:25:07,610 --> 00:25:08,950
Switch time with a person
of your choice.

726
00:25:09,020 --> 00:25:10,340
This is a bit tricky.

727
00:25:10,340 --> 00:25:12,110
- It is.
- He has enough time.

728
00:25:12,110 --> 00:25:14,580
- He needs to pick someone.
- This is tricky.

729
00:25:14,760 --> 00:25:15,960
Do I have to do this?

730
00:25:16,190 --> 00:25:17,920
- Yes.
- You must.

731
00:25:18,060 --> 00:25:19,150
Isn't he done?

732
00:25:19,150 --> 00:25:21,460
- He is. Get out.
- I haven't chosen yet.

733
00:25:21,460 --> 00:25:23,120
- Chosen what?
- I have to choose a member.

734
00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:24,660
- Get out.
- I haven't picked someone yet.

735
00:25:24,770 --> 00:25:25,970
- You can switch with someone?
- Yes.

736
00:25:25,970 --> 00:25:27,040
(He runs the risk
of shortening his current time.)

737
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:30,830
How many hours did he have?

738
00:25:30,900 --> 00:25:34,510
When I was down there,
I was stripped of my time.

739
00:25:34,510 --> 00:25:35,870
Was he? Did you see it?

740
00:25:36,710 --> 00:25:39,450
The others must've ripped off
your name tag several times.

741
00:25:39,450 --> 00:25:40,520
Many times.

742
00:25:40,520 --> 00:25:42,670
How much time does Kwang Soo have?

743
00:25:42,670 --> 00:25:43,840
- Guess.
- Kwang Soo?

744
00:25:43,840 --> 00:25:45,190
Five of us ganged up on him,
but we lost.

745
00:25:45,190 --> 00:25:46,880
He's the strongest.

746
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:49,080
He took all my time away.

747
00:25:49,080 --> 00:25:52,290
I have my trust in you.

748
00:25:52,730 --> 00:25:55,230
- Get out.
- Even Kyung-hwan can't beat him?

749
00:25:55,230 --> 00:25:57,770
(After hearing their testimonies...)

750
00:25:57,770 --> 00:25:59,730
Lee Kwang Soo.

751
00:25:59,770 --> 00:26:02,360
- Your times have been swapped.
- Okay.

752
00:26:02,360 --> 00:26:03,360
Seriously?

753
00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:06,010
Haha had the chance to swap times.

754
00:26:06,060 --> 00:26:09,710
And he chose you...

755
00:26:10,070 --> 00:26:11,600
to swap times with.

756
00:26:13,070 --> 00:26:14,570
(Swearing)

757
00:26:14,670 --> 00:26:15,910
(Kwang Soo)

758
00:26:15,910 --> 00:26:17,750
You've now received his time.

759
00:26:17,750 --> 00:26:18,810
(His glory days are past him.)

760
00:26:21,410 --> 00:26:24,190
(Haha suddenly becomes
very wealthy.)

761
00:26:24,190 --> 00:26:25,380
Haha.

762
00:26:25,420 --> 00:26:27,500
Haha, brother. Please help me.

763
00:26:27,500 --> 00:26:28,920
Haha, please.

764
00:26:29,300 --> 00:26:30,300
You...

765
00:26:30,300 --> 00:26:31,300
Haha, me too.

766
00:26:31,300 --> 00:26:32,820
What about you?

767
00:26:32,820 --> 00:26:34,390
There's no point in taking hers.

768
00:26:34,390 --> 00:26:35,970
- Hold on.
- Just do something.

769
00:26:35,970 --> 00:26:37,830
I'll leave you to it then.

770
00:26:37,830 --> 00:26:39,210
- Sort things out yourselves.
- Sure.

771
00:26:39,210 --> 00:26:40,780
- Wait.
- I'll only take in one person.

772
00:26:40,780 --> 00:26:42,600
- Only one.
- Han Na, rip So Min's name tag off.

773
00:26:42,600 --> 00:26:44,370
- You guys are nothing.
- Can you?

774
00:26:44,370 --> 00:26:48,020
Can you believe my luck?

775
00:26:48,370 --> 00:26:49,750
(The little ones
begin their own war.)

776
00:26:49,750 --> 00:26:51,020
What now?

777
00:26:52,290 --> 00:26:53,550
(The two sisters join forces.)

778
00:26:53,550 --> 00:26:54,760
You two...

779
00:26:54,760 --> 00:26:55,760
(The puny girls charge forward!)

780
00:26:55,760 --> 00:26:57,580
Guys, please.

781
00:26:57,580 --> 00:26:58,960
No, not mine.

782
00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:00,230
I ripped off his name tag!

783
00:27:00,230 --> 00:27:01,850
(Han Na, So Min, Se Chan)

784
00:27:02,150 --> 00:27:03,860
It won't do you any good.

785
00:27:03,860 --> 00:27:06,970
Pause, everyone. Han Na
ripped off Se Chan's name tag.

786
00:27:06,970 --> 00:27:08,560
It won't do you any good.

787
00:27:08,560 --> 00:27:10,310
Why would you take
my non-existing time?

788
00:27:10,310 --> 00:27:13,270
Anyway, you stole Se Chan's time.

789
00:27:13,270 --> 00:27:14,370
(They each added
1 minute and 10 seconds.)

790
00:27:14,370 --> 00:27:15,400
What a relief.

791
00:27:15,400 --> 00:27:18,100
- We did it.
- My gosh.

792
00:27:18,870 --> 00:27:20,950
- Over here.
- Come over here.

793
00:27:20,950 --> 00:27:22,050
Guys.

794
00:27:22,550 --> 00:27:24,750
I'll tell you the time I had.
I only had two minutes left.

795
00:27:25,020 --> 00:27:27,760
Can you please take my hand?
Give me at least five more minutes.

796
00:27:27,760 --> 00:27:29,580
Hold on. Which floor?

797
00:27:29,580 --> 00:27:31,190
- 14th floor.
- 14th? I don't have the time...

798
00:27:31,190 --> 00:27:32,320
to make it up there.

799
00:27:32,320 --> 00:27:34,060
- Hold on.
- How much time do you have left?

800
00:27:34,060 --> 00:27:35,560
- Hurry. Where's Han Na?
- I'll take yours.

801
00:27:35,560 --> 00:27:37,200
No, wait. Where's Han Na?

802
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:39,470
- Let me take yours instead.
- Where's Han Na?

803
00:27:39,470 --> 00:27:42,360
(Why bother living
such an exhausting life?)

804
00:27:43,300 --> 00:27:45,240
- Where's Han Na?
- Take So Min's for now.

805
00:27:45,560 --> 00:27:46,560
I took So Min's.

806
00:27:46,560 --> 00:27:49,280
Se Chan, you lost half of your time.

807
00:27:49,280 --> 00:27:50,750
- Why?
- Se Chan.

808
00:27:50,750 --> 00:27:54,020
(He ripped So Min's name tag off
when she had more time.)

809
00:27:54,020 --> 00:27:55,720
Nice. Is my time still intact?

810
00:27:55,720 --> 00:27:56,910
- Yes.
- Then I should get going.

811
00:27:56,910 --> 00:27:58,110
Hold on.

812
00:27:58,380 --> 00:27:59,490
Wait.

813
00:27:59,490 --> 00:28:01,720
Se Chan, you have 40 seconds left.

814
00:28:01,910 --> 00:28:04,350
Call the person you miss the most.

815
00:28:04,350 --> 00:28:05,850
(Call the person you miss the most.)

816
00:28:05,850 --> 00:28:07,820
- Go on.
- There's no one to call.

817
00:28:07,820 --> 00:28:09,560
I'll be back in the next round then.

818
00:28:09,560 --> 00:28:11,160
- Sure.
- Get back to us soon.

819
00:28:11,160 --> 00:28:13,060
- I'll see you later.
- Sure.

820
00:28:13,300 --> 00:28:14,830
Meet us on the eighth floor.

821
00:28:16,860 --> 00:28:18,330
(Hold on!)

822
00:28:19,940 --> 00:28:22,310
(Kwang Soo spots an envelope
with a name on it.)

823
00:28:22,310 --> 00:28:25,210
I have Jong Kook's name tag!

824
00:28:25,210 --> 00:28:26,210
(He obtains Jong Kook's name tag.)

825
00:28:26,210 --> 00:28:28,750
(He finds Jong Kook's name tag
once again.)

826
00:28:28,750 --> 00:28:32,080
I found two name tags
with Jong Kook's name.

827
00:28:32,080 --> 00:28:34,020
If you find two name tags
in the same name,

828
00:28:34,020 --> 00:28:36,310
that person's remaining time
will be revealed.

829
00:28:36,690 --> 00:28:39,260
Kwang Soo, we'll let you know
Jong Kook's remaining time.

830
00:28:39,350 --> 00:28:42,030
It's 3 hours and 46 minutes.

831
00:28:42,030 --> 00:28:46,300
(Jong Kook is in 1st place
with 3 hours and 46 minutes.)

832
00:28:46,590 --> 00:28:48,270
3 hours and 46 minutes?

833
00:28:48,270 --> 00:28:49,300
Kwang Soo.

834
00:28:49,300 --> 00:28:51,270
(Kwang Soo!)

835
00:28:51,270 --> 00:28:52,470
Let's rip off Jong Kook's name tag.

836
00:28:52,470 --> 00:28:54,370
Let's rip off Jong Kook's
name tag together.

837
00:28:54,370 --> 00:28:56,330
I heard how much time
Jong Kook has left.

838
00:28:56,780 --> 00:28:58,510
- I heard it.
- And?

839
00:28:58,510 --> 00:29:00,250
If we make an attack together...

840
00:29:00,250 --> 00:29:03,480
(Ji Hyo joins forces too.)

841
00:29:03,480 --> 00:29:05,810
Hold on, guys. Just hear me out.

842
00:29:05,810 --> 00:29:08,460
- Sure, go ahead.
- If we turn against each other,

843
00:29:08,460 --> 00:29:09,960
- Jong Kook will win.
- Do you have my name tag?

844
00:29:10,220 --> 00:29:11,290
No, I don't.

845
00:29:11,560 --> 00:29:13,650
Haha, we know the time
each of us has left.

846
00:29:13,650 --> 00:29:16,560
- Right.
- It wasn't on purpose but...

847
00:29:16,560 --> 00:29:18,060
Did you spin the wheel then?

848
00:29:18,060 --> 00:29:19,390
- I didn't.
- Let me rip off your name tag.

849
00:29:19,390 --> 00:29:21,090
You can have these.

850
00:29:21,090 --> 00:29:23,360
- They don't have much time left.
- We're the Three Musketeers.

851
00:29:23,360 --> 00:29:24,600
- Hold on.
- Just this once.

852
00:29:24,600 --> 00:29:25,660
We'll share the time.

853
00:29:25,660 --> 00:29:27,130
Charlie's Angels, do your thing.

854
00:29:27,130 --> 00:29:28,130
(Charlie's Angels, do your thing.)

855
00:29:28,130 --> 00:29:29,370
Rip his name tag off.

856
00:29:29,570 --> 00:29:33,070
(Haha charges at Kwang Soo.)

857
00:29:33,070 --> 00:29:34,340
Get him!

858
00:29:34,340 --> 00:29:35,840
- Take him.
- Get his hand.

859
00:29:35,840 --> 00:29:37,810
- Get him.
- Hold on a second.

860
00:29:37,810 --> 00:29:39,950
Wait. Gosh.

861
00:29:39,950 --> 00:29:42,650
They're all upstairs.
I see Kwang Soo.

862
00:29:42,650 --> 00:29:43,650
(And watching everything unravel...)

863
00:29:43,650 --> 00:29:45,580
(is Jong Kook who's in 1st place.)

864
00:29:46,490 --> 00:29:47,500
(Kwang Soo versus
Haha and Charlie's Angels)

865
00:29:47,500 --> 00:29:49,320
Wait. Gosh.

866
00:29:49,320 --> 00:29:51,590
We need to get Kwang Soo.

867
00:29:51,590 --> 00:29:52,590
We...

868
00:29:52,590 --> 00:29:53,590
(But at that moment)

869
00:29:53,590 --> 00:29:55,330
(Their hands weren't touching.)

870
00:29:55,330 --> 00:29:57,360
We need to get Kwang Soo.

871
00:29:57,360 --> 00:29:58,660
(Ripping)

872
00:29:59,270 --> 00:30:00,480
Okay.

873
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:01,670
(Haha rips Kwang Soo's name tag
without holding hands.)

874
00:30:01,670 --> 00:30:02,670
I got it.

875
00:30:03,400 --> 00:30:05,310
- What now?
- They ripped my name tag off!

876
00:30:05,310 --> 00:30:07,140
- They did?
- Oh, no.

877
00:30:07,140 --> 00:30:08,280
What's going on?

878
00:30:08,450 --> 00:30:10,310
- They cornered me.
- Exactly.

879
00:30:10,310 --> 00:30:12,140
Haha ripped it off
by himself though.

880
00:30:12,140 --> 00:30:13,380
(Their hands weren't held,
so only Haha gets Kwang Soo's time.)

881
00:30:13,580 --> 00:30:15,220
No way.

882
00:30:15,220 --> 00:30:17,920
(Kwang Soo, Haha)

883
00:30:18,120 --> 00:30:21,090
Unbelievable. You'll have
a chance against Jong Kook now.

884
00:30:21,320 --> 00:30:24,470
(Haha's in 2nd place while
Jong Kook's in 1st place.)

885
00:30:24,660 --> 00:30:26,470
- Our last hope is gone.
- I'm done too.

886
00:30:26,470 --> 00:30:28,890
- Me too.
- Charlie's Angels are over.

887
00:30:28,940 --> 00:30:30,040
Charlie's Angels?

888
00:30:30,040 --> 00:30:32,360
It ended five minutes
after being formed.

889
00:30:32,360 --> 00:30:33,440
- Honestly...
- Where's the yellow jacket?

890
00:30:33,660 --> 00:30:37,400
So Min, please change into
the yellow uniform.

891
00:30:38,170 --> 00:30:39,210
Is it over for you?

892
00:30:39,210 --> 00:30:41,340
Also, Han Na is out too.

893
00:30:41,340 --> 00:30:42,640
- Really?
- Already?

894
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:43,640
Please leave with So Min.

895
00:30:43,640 --> 00:30:44,880
Is Ji Hyo still in the game?

896
00:30:45,380 --> 00:30:46,610
It's now the dynamic duo.

897
00:30:46,950 --> 00:30:49,560
Ji Hyo, I hope you survive.

898
00:30:49,560 --> 00:30:51,290
- I'm not sure but...
- It'll be over soon for me too.

899
00:30:51,290 --> 00:30:52,490
- My time's almost up as well.
- It was swapped.

900
00:30:53,230 --> 00:30:56,260
Hold on. Is anyone downstairs?

901
00:30:58,320 --> 00:31:00,660
(He shows Ji Hyo
how much time she has left.)

902
00:31:02,560 --> 00:31:04,970
(She only has 6 minutes left.)

903
00:31:04,970 --> 00:31:06,900
What is it? How much time
do you have left?

904
00:31:07,330 --> 00:31:09,540
It's time for me
to dress in yellow too.

905
00:31:09,780 --> 00:31:11,170
How much time do you have left?

906
00:31:11,170 --> 00:31:12,170
Six minutes.

907
00:31:12,170 --> 00:31:13,840
(Six minutes.)

908
00:31:14,840 --> 00:31:17,250
(Oh, dear)

909
00:31:18,140 --> 00:31:20,580
(It's over for me, Haha.)

910
00:31:20,580 --> 00:31:22,260
Shouldn't you find a way?

911
00:31:22,260 --> 00:31:23,290
(No, don't lose hope.)

912
00:31:24,150 --> 00:31:25,190
(Ripping off)

913
00:31:25,460 --> 00:31:26,460
(Startled)

914
00:31:28,850 --> 00:31:30,560
(Haha, Ji Hyo)

915
00:31:30,560 --> 00:31:31,820
(Haha steals half
of what Ji Hyo has.)

916
00:31:31,820 --> 00:31:33,860
I only had six minutes left!

917
00:31:33,860 --> 00:31:34,940
- Right.
- Six minutes!

918
00:31:34,940 --> 00:31:38,130
I have to take the elevator,
but I don't have enough time.

919
00:31:38,130 --> 00:31:39,330
Let me save three minutes.

920
00:31:39,330 --> 00:31:41,480
Why can't you let me have
three minutes?

921
00:31:41,480 --> 00:31:43,540
Are you serious?

922
00:31:44,100 --> 00:31:45,600
You jerk.

923
00:31:46,250 --> 00:31:50,750
How dare you mug the poor!
Unbelievable.

924
00:31:50,750 --> 00:31:52,290
Guys, let's head out.

925
00:31:52,290 --> 00:31:53,910
- No way.
- I earned three minutes.

926
00:31:53,910 --> 00:31:55,350
- Let's go.
- You jerk!

927
00:31:55,350 --> 00:31:56,650
(Haha obtains time to take
the elevator and leaves.)

928
00:31:56,650 --> 00:31:58,080
Unbelievable.

929
00:31:58,080 --> 00:31:59,490
(Ji Hyo has nothing left.)

930
00:31:59,490 --> 00:32:01,460
Do I only have three minutes now?

931
00:32:03,560 --> 00:32:04,700
Don't worry.

932
00:32:05,230 --> 00:32:07,060
I don't hurt those
who are hanging by a thread.

933
00:32:07,060 --> 00:32:09,770
It's really over for me.
I'm done for.

934
00:32:09,770 --> 00:32:11,600
I know that but...

935
00:32:11,970 --> 00:32:13,600
Isn't Haha untouchable now?

936
00:32:13,660 --> 00:32:16,570
He even took three minutes from me.

937
00:32:16,570 --> 00:32:17,780
What? So you only have
three minutes left now?

938
00:32:17,780 --> 00:32:19,370
Exactly!

939
00:32:19,370 --> 00:32:21,070
Get your last minute
of sunshine then.

940
00:32:21,070 --> 00:32:22,070
Darn.

941
00:32:22,070 --> 00:32:23,550
Why are you here in the shade?

942
00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:27,760
Go ahead. You did very well today.

943
00:32:28,350 --> 00:32:31,030
I can't believe
I had to be consoled by him.

944
00:32:31,030 --> 00:32:32,260
(Ji Hyo)

945
00:32:32,260 --> 00:32:33,760
Unbelievable.

946
00:32:33,760 --> 00:32:36,030
Ji Hyo, your time is up.

947
00:32:36,820 --> 00:32:38,390
(Ji Hyo)

948
00:32:38,390 --> 00:32:39,970
(Her elimination is imminent.)

949
00:32:40,970 --> 00:32:43,830
(Thankfully,
the sun is there to shine on her.)

950
00:32:44,540 --> 00:32:46,130
Give me the yellow uniform.

951
00:32:46,130 --> 00:32:47,130
Gosh.

952
00:32:47,130 --> 00:32:48,130
(Ji Hyo is out!)

953
00:32:48,130 --> 00:32:49,210
No...

954
00:32:49,210 --> 00:32:50,780
(Ji Hyo)

955
00:32:52,400 --> 00:32:57,220
(Jong Kook, Haha,
Kyung-hwan, Kwang Soo)

956
00:32:57,220 --> 00:32:58,310
Open it.

957
00:32:58,310 --> 00:32:59,310
(Suk Jin has seniority.)

958
00:32:59,310 --> 00:33:00,580
(The two head over
to open another Room of Time.)

959
00:33:00,580 --> 00:33:02,110
Number 59. What is it?

960
00:33:02,760 --> 00:33:03,960
Number 59.

961
00:33:03,960 --> 00:33:05,260
(Jae Suk takes a step to the side.)

962
00:33:05,260 --> 00:33:07,060
(Trotting)

963
00:33:07,060 --> 00:33:08,420
There aren't any cameras in there.

964
00:33:08,650 --> 00:33:10,460
Suk Jin, wait for your camera!

965
00:33:10,460 --> 00:33:11,500
What is it?

966
00:33:11,500 --> 00:33:13,920
(He has a hard time opening a door.)

967
00:33:14,300 --> 00:33:15,630
Why aren't you following me?

968
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:17,360
I have seniority here.

969
00:33:17,660 --> 00:33:19,240
Why would you stay with Jae Suk...

970
00:33:19,240 --> 00:33:20,560
- when I have seniority?
- This is hilarious.

971
00:33:20,560 --> 00:33:23,170
Why didn't they follow you inside?

972
00:33:24,170 --> 00:33:25,710
- Why are you lurking around?
- Kyung-hwan, it's you.

973
00:33:25,710 --> 00:33:28,310
- Hi.
- Unbelievable.

974
00:33:28,310 --> 00:33:29,570
It's me.

975
00:33:29,570 --> 00:33:31,910
- What are you two doing here?
- What good will knowing it do?

976
00:33:31,910 --> 00:33:34,850
- You'll be joining us soon anyway.
- It's not what I meant.

977
00:33:34,850 --> 00:33:36,460
(Don't poke the bear
when he's already upset.)

978
00:33:36,460 --> 00:33:37,730
Why are you trying to know
so many things?

979
00:33:37,730 --> 00:33:40,580
What we do is different
from what you do.

980
00:33:40,580 --> 00:33:42,200
- But...
- Don't interfere with our work.

981
00:33:42,200 --> 00:33:43,500
- Well...
- We won't interfere with yours.

982
00:33:43,500 --> 00:33:45,730
Why are you trudging
along the halls though?

983
00:33:45,860 --> 00:33:47,770
- Shouldn't you be working alone?
- Trudging?

984
00:33:47,770 --> 00:33:49,970
What do you know about
what we do anyway?

985
00:33:49,970 --> 00:33:51,310
How many cameras
do you have on your tail?

986
00:33:51,310 --> 00:33:53,660
How many cameras?
I see four, so what?

987
00:33:53,660 --> 00:33:54,710
Is this the place?

988
00:33:55,310 --> 00:33:56,400
I guess not.

989
00:33:56,400 --> 00:33:57,840
You must be creating a Room of Time.

990
00:33:57,840 --> 00:33:59,170
- Is this the place?
- Is it your job...

991
00:33:59,170 --> 00:34:00,550
to make a Room of Time?

992
00:34:00,570 --> 00:34:02,950
(Busted)

993
00:34:02,950 --> 00:34:04,380
If you follow us...

994
00:34:05,250 --> 00:34:06,250
Where are you going?

995
00:34:06,250 --> 00:34:07,760
(Why do they keep
lurking around this place?)

996
00:34:07,760 --> 00:34:09,490
Where's room number 59?

997
00:34:09,490 --> 00:34:12,380
(The manager can't locate
the Room of Time.)

998
00:34:12,380 --> 00:34:14,650
This is the place. Here we go.

999
00:34:14,650 --> 00:34:15,730
(Found it!)

1000
00:34:16,500 --> 00:34:18,860
Here it is. Room number 59.

1001
00:34:18,860 --> 00:34:20,020
Hello.

1002
00:34:20,020 --> 00:34:21,500
Hello, fellow judges.

1003
00:34:22,360 --> 00:34:23,400
This isn't good.

1004
00:34:24,270 --> 00:34:26,130
Where is the Room of Time?

1005
00:34:26,130 --> 00:34:29,040
Where's the Room of Time?
Where is it?

1006
00:34:29,040 --> 00:34:30,170
(They wish to find the room first
and change their lives around.)

1007
00:34:30,170 --> 00:34:32,440
(Who will be the first
to arrive at the Room of Time?)

1008
00:34:32,440 --> 00:34:33,650
Gosh.

1009
00:34:34,770 --> 00:34:36,820
And open!

1010
00:34:36,820 --> 00:34:38,020
(The Room of Time is open.)

1011
00:34:38,020 --> 00:34:39,020
Good.

1012
00:34:39,710 --> 00:34:41,960
The third Room of Time is now open.

1013
00:34:41,960 --> 00:34:44,190
(The third Room of Time
is now open.)

1014
00:34:44,190 --> 00:34:46,020
I want to be untouchable.

1015
00:34:46,920 --> 00:34:48,290
That's all I want.

1016
00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:50,360
This is the scariest place
that exists right now.

1017
00:34:50,360 --> 00:34:51,730
- Don't you think so?
- Be careful, all right?

1018
00:34:51,730 --> 00:34:54,860
This is where you
bring your juniors to scold.

1019
00:34:54,860 --> 00:34:56,770
- It's the scariest place of all.
- I know.

1020
00:34:56,770 --> 00:34:57,860
(He spies on the judges.)

1021
00:34:57,860 --> 00:35:00,460
(Who's the first one
to be at the Room of Time?)

1022
00:35:00,670 --> 00:35:01,670
It's why I telling you
to be careful.

1023
00:35:01,670 --> 00:35:03,070
What are you talking about?

1024
00:35:03,610 --> 00:35:04,670
What is this anyway?

1025
00:35:04,670 --> 00:35:06,940
It's like they came here to chat.

1026
00:35:06,940 --> 00:35:08,920
I'm loving this location.

1027
00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:10,650
Do you remember...

1028
00:35:10,650 --> 00:35:13,920
the hallway scene from "Oldboy"?

1029
00:35:13,920 --> 00:35:16,750
It's exactly like that hallway.
I could fight 20 men here.

1030
00:35:16,750 --> 00:35:19,560
I'd rather get some rest,
so please don't talk to me.

1031
00:35:19,560 --> 00:35:20,650
(I'd rather get some rest,
so please don't talk to me.)

1032
00:35:20,650 --> 00:35:23,190
Unbelievable.

1033
00:35:23,360 --> 00:35:24,400
Got it?

1034
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:25,960
You have no respect
for your seniors.

1035
00:35:25,960 --> 00:35:27,770
- What?
- This is why...

1036
00:35:27,770 --> 00:35:30,500
those with seniority
should educate their juniors.

1037
00:35:30,500 --> 00:35:32,360
Why though?

1038
00:35:32,360 --> 00:35:33,940
Guys, congratulations
on the opening.

1039
00:35:33,940 --> 00:35:35,570
(Guys, congratulations
on the opening.)

1040
00:35:36,630 --> 00:35:37,750
What?

1041
00:35:38,040 --> 00:35:39,380
Congratulations.

1042
00:35:39,380 --> 00:35:41,750
I heard that a Room of Time
has been opened.

1043
00:35:41,820 --> 00:35:44,210
- Hey.
- Stop following us around.

1044
00:35:44,210 --> 00:35:45,920
- We won't allow you.
- You're not allowed.

1045
00:35:46,190 --> 00:35:47,380
- Leave.
- Stop him.

1046
00:35:47,380 --> 00:35:49,290
- This is cheating.
- You can't do this.

1047
00:35:49,290 --> 00:35:50,380
We won't allow you to go in.

1048
00:35:50,380 --> 00:35:53,150
The Room of Time
isn't some joke, you know.

1049
00:35:53,150 --> 00:35:55,150
Why is it only sought out
by the cheaters?

1050
00:35:55,150 --> 00:35:56,460
This isn't an easy place to find.

1051
00:35:56,460 --> 00:35:59,360
Are you judges former thugs?
You can't block my way.

1052
00:35:59,360 --> 00:36:00,940
Former thugs?

1053
00:36:00,940 --> 00:36:01,960
You're abusing your power.

1054
00:36:01,960 --> 00:36:04,270
You have to beat us both
in a game of rock-paper-scissors.

1055
00:36:04,270 --> 00:36:05,270
That's absurd.

1056
00:36:05,270 --> 00:36:06,960
- That's the rule.
- No way.

1057
00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:07,980
Why not?

1058
00:36:07,980 --> 00:36:09,040
<i>- Rock-paper-scissors
- Rock-paper-scissors</i>

1059
00:36:09,040 --> 00:36:10,400
(Kyung-hwan wins.)

1060
00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:12,310
- Move.
- What? You lost?

1061
00:36:13,110 --> 00:36:14,320
Rock-paper-scissors

1062
00:36:14,320 --> 00:36:15,650
(Kyung-hwan wins again.)

1063
00:36:15,650 --> 00:36:17,020
- Go ahead.
- He won.

1064
00:36:17,020 --> 00:36:18,020
(Darn...)

1065
00:36:18,840 --> 00:36:20,090
All right.

1066
00:36:20,090 --> 00:36:21,460
(He managed to clear
the made-up rule.)

1067
00:36:22,320 --> 00:36:24,460
I can't believe we both lost.

1068
00:36:26,420 --> 00:36:27,560
Gosh, seriously.

1069
00:36:27,560 --> 00:36:30,650
If I don't do this,
I won't be able to win.

1070
00:36:30,730 --> 00:36:32,090
A third of your time
will be taken away.

1071
00:36:32,090 --> 00:36:34,340
- A third of your time...
- "A person of your choice..."

1072
00:36:34,340 --> 00:36:35,790
"Steal half of the time
from a person chosen randomly."

1073
00:36:36,500 --> 00:36:37,860
Gosh, Kyung-hwan.

1074
00:36:39,070 --> 00:36:40,170
You need more screen time.

1075
00:36:40,170 --> 00:36:42,270
(The boring man is determined.)

1076
00:36:42,270 --> 00:36:45,310
(What will the roulette give him?)

1077
00:36:50,380 --> 00:36:53,250
"Steal half of the time
from a person chosen randomly."

1078
00:36:53,710 --> 00:36:55,190
I want Haha or Jong Kook.

1079
00:36:55,190 --> 00:36:56,610
(He can steal half of the time from
the member whose name he draws.)

1080
00:36:56,610 --> 00:36:57,690
I want Haha or Jong Kook.

1081
00:36:57,690 --> 00:36:59,250
(Jong Kook and Haha
have the most amount of time.)

1082
00:36:59,460 --> 00:37:00,520
I want Haha or Jong Kook.

1083
00:37:02,020 --> 00:37:03,900
(He gets Jong Kook,
who is in 1st place.)

1084
00:37:03,900 --> 00:37:05,070
I got Jong Kook.

1085
00:37:07,090 --> 00:37:09,070
Kyung-hwan drew a name...

1086
00:37:09,290 --> 00:37:11,940
Kyung-hwan stole half of your time.

1087
00:37:11,940 --> 00:37:13,210
Gosh.

1088
00:37:13,570 --> 00:37:15,610
He already had a lot of time.
Why did he do that?

1089
00:37:17,110 --> 00:37:21,170
(Jong Kook: 1st to 3rd place,
Kyung-hwan: 3rd to 2nd place)

1090
00:37:21,170 --> 00:37:23,570
Really? But I'm still at the top.

1091
00:37:23,570 --> 00:37:24,840
(Haha jumps to 1st place.)

1092
00:37:25,790 --> 00:37:27,750
(Also, Kwang Soo is now
way behind the others.)

1093
00:37:27,750 --> 00:37:29,710
- Suk Jin, where are you?
- Hi.

1094
00:37:29,710 --> 00:37:31,090
Are we on the 8th floor? The 9th?

1095
00:37:31,090 --> 00:37:32,480
(Kwang Soo is talking to Judge Jee.)

1096
00:37:32,480 --> 00:37:34,420
You guys can open the Room of Time,

1097
00:37:34,920 --> 00:37:36,130
right?

1098
00:37:36,320 --> 00:37:38,900
I'm the one who manages it.

1099
00:37:38,900 --> 00:37:40,360
- Okay.
- I'm the boss.

1100
00:37:40,360 --> 00:37:42,190
Okay, I'll pay you a visit
right now.

1101
00:37:42,190 --> 00:37:43,230
(Polite)

1102
00:37:43,230 --> 00:37:44,710
You'll pay me a visit?
Which floor is this?

1103
00:37:45,400 --> 00:37:47,230
- Come to the eighth floor.
- Yes, I'll be right there.

1104
00:37:47,900 --> 00:37:49,040
Thank you.

1105
00:37:49,900 --> 00:37:51,440
He must be up to something.

1106
00:37:51,440 --> 00:37:55,920
Kwang Soo knows the Room of Time
is where we are.

1107
00:37:56,020 --> 00:37:57,270
That's not it.

1108
00:37:57,270 --> 00:37:59,210
- He must have something to say.
- What do you mean?

1109
00:37:59,790 --> 00:38:01,360
He said he'd pay me a visit.

1110
00:38:01,360 --> 00:38:02,920
He wants to use the Room of Time.

1111
00:38:02,920 --> 00:38:04,250
Gosh, I can't believe him.

1112
00:38:04,750 --> 00:38:06,060
You don't even know the rules?

1113
00:38:06,060 --> 00:38:07,730
Did you stop caring
two and a half hours ago?

1114
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:09,420
Let's hear him out first.

1115
00:38:09,500 --> 00:38:11,290
- He must have a reason.
- Then...

1116
00:38:11,290 --> 00:38:13,500
Se Chan and I will go up
to the ninth floor.

1117
00:38:13,500 --> 00:38:14,790
Suk Jin, you stay here...

1118
00:38:14,790 --> 00:38:16,690
- so that Kwang Soo can't follow us.
- Okay.

1119
00:38:16,770 --> 00:38:18,360
- You guys go ahead. Take this.
- We'll go up.

1120
00:38:18,360 --> 00:38:20,810
We have a very important role.

1121
00:38:20,810 --> 00:38:22,770
- You're like a team manager.
- Exactly.

1122
00:38:22,770 --> 00:38:24,650
I'm in charge of
the overall arrangement.

1123
00:38:24,710 --> 00:38:25,980
- Hi.
- Where...

1124
00:38:26,480 --> 00:38:27,820
- He's in there.
- He's in there.

1125
00:38:27,820 --> 00:38:29,040
- Our boss is in there.
- Go to our boss.

1126
00:38:30,710 --> 00:38:33,150
- You did a great job.
- Of course.

1127
00:38:33,150 --> 00:38:34,210
(Flattering)

1128
00:38:34,610 --> 00:38:35,920
I'm sorry I'm late.

1129
00:38:36,520 --> 00:38:38,190
How do I look?

1130
00:38:38,190 --> 00:38:39,360
I wish you a happy new year.

1131
00:38:40,420 --> 00:38:41,460
All right.

1132
00:38:41,460 --> 00:38:42,960
It's been a while
since New Year's Day,

1133
00:38:42,960 --> 00:38:44,730
but I never got to bow to you then.

1134
00:38:45,860 --> 00:38:47,170
How much time do you have left?

1135
00:38:47,270 --> 00:38:49,170
I have only about 20 minutes left.

1136
00:38:49,190 --> 00:38:50,590
(Laughing)

1137
00:38:50,590 --> 00:38:52,770
I thought you had a lot of time.

1138
00:38:52,770 --> 00:38:54,000
I used to,

1139
00:38:54,230 --> 00:38:55,670
but in the end,

1140
00:38:55,670 --> 00:38:56,940
Haha switched his time with mine.

1141
00:38:56,940 --> 00:38:57,940
(Haha left Kwang Soo
with almost no time.)

1142
00:38:58,210 --> 00:38:59,940
I was right there, so I know.

1143
00:39:00,750 --> 00:39:03,570
- I'm the one who manages.
- That's right.

1144
00:39:03,570 --> 00:39:05,840
- I opened four rooms myself.
- You're right.

1145
00:39:05,840 --> 00:39:07,480
Who do you think opened
all the Rooms of Time?

1146
00:39:07,520 --> 00:39:09,290
- You did, Boss.
- Right?

1147
00:39:10,060 --> 00:39:12,290
- I always feel close to you.
- Right?

1148
00:39:12,290 --> 00:39:13,420
- Feeling!
- Intuition!

1149
00:39:13,420 --> 00:39:14,460
- Cross!
- Cross!

1150
00:39:14,460 --> 00:39:15,650
(Feeling! Intuition! Cross!)

1151
00:39:16,250 --> 00:39:17,920
- Fine, I'll tell you where it is.
- Okay.

1152
00:39:18,190 --> 00:39:19,320
Wait.

1153
00:39:19,360 --> 00:39:20,520
Where did it go?

1154
00:39:20,790 --> 00:39:22,090
Oh, here it is.

1155
00:39:22,090 --> 00:39:24,710
(Kwang Soo wants to complain
but holds back.)

1156
00:39:24,710 --> 00:39:26,860
(Laughing)

1157
00:39:26,940 --> 00:39:29,630
I'll tell you where it is.
Rush there right now.

1158
00:39:29,670 --> 00:39:30,940
- Okay.
- But let's split it 60-40.

1159
00:39:32,040 --> 00:39:33,170
Take it or leave it.

1160
00:39:33,940 --> 00:39:35,110
I take 60.

1161
00:39:35,110 --> 00:39:36,320
(The negotiation is
about to break down.)

1162
00:39:37,150 --> 00:39:40,020
(Nervous)

1163
00:39:40,020 --> 00:39:44,020
- Oh, my.
- My goodness.

1164
00:39:44,020 --> 00:39:45,290
- You startled me.
- You look startled too.

1165
00:39:45,380 --> 00:39:49,560
I didn't know it was mere judges.

1166
00:39:49,820 --> 00:39:51,690
"Mere judges"?

1167
00:39:51,690 --> 00:39:54,360
- I had no idea.
- He arranges the whole thing.

1168
00:39:54,360 --> 00:39:56,360
- I set the whole thing up.
- Really?

1169
00:39:56,440 --> 00:39:58,130
How did you know
we were coming here?

1170
00:39:58,130 --> 00:40:01,170
I had a feeling there would be
something in the outdoor garden,

1171
00:40:01,170 --> 00:40:02,610
and I found the Room of Time here.

1172
00:40:02,940 --> 00:40:05,340
If I don't get ahead now...

1173
00:40:05,610 --> 00:40:08,750
If I tell them not to open it,
they can't.

1174
00:40:08,750 --> 00:40:11,210
- Should I wait there?
- I don't let everyone in.

1175
00:40:11,840 --> 00:40:14,320
- I'm sorry.
- This is driving me crazy.

1176
00:40:15,090 --> 00:40:16,980
This is my only shot.

1177
00:40:16,980 --> 00:40:18,130
- It's open.
- Okay!

1178
00:40:18,130 --> 00:40:19,250
- Is that it?
- It's open.

1179
00:40:19,250 --> 00:40:20,250
(The 4th Room of Time is open.)

1180
00:40:20,250 --> 00:40:21,790
The fourth Room of Time is open.

1181
00:40:22,060 --> 00:40:23,590
- All right.
- Wish me luck.

1182
00:40:23,690 --> 00:40:25,500
I wish you good luck.

1183
00:40:26,170 --> 00:40:27,290
Is that it?

1184
00:40:27,360 --> 00:40:29,440
The fourth Room of Time is open.

1185
00:40:29,500 --> 00:40:31,230
- Go to the ninth floor. Run!
- Okay.

1186
00:40:31,230 --> 00:40:33,770
- The garden on the ninth floor!
- Okay!

1187
00:40:33,770 --> 00:40:34,840
(I have to get in this time!)

1188
00:40:34,840 --> 00:40:35,940
"Switch time with a person
of your choice."

1189
00:40:35,940 --> 00:40:38,840
(But Jong Kook already entered
by paying a third of his time.)

1190
00:40:38,840 --> 00:40:41,420
(Will he get "Switch time
with a person of your choice"?)

1191
00:40:43,020 --> 00:40:45,690
(He got it!)

1192
00:40:45,690 --> 00:40:47,790
(Switch time with a person
of your choice.)

1193
00:40:47,790 --> 00:40:49,790
- You can switch time with someone.
- I got it for real.

1194
00:40:50,460 --> 00:40:51,790
It happened for real.

1195
00:40:51,790 --> 00:40:53,750
(Jong Kook can now switch time
with a person of his choice.)

1196
00:40:54,190 --> 00:40:58,670
(If he switches with Haha,
he can go back up to 1st place.)

1197
00:40:59,070 --> 00:41:00,190
I got it for real.

1198
00:41:00,630 --> 00:41:01,860
It happened for real.

1199
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:04,130
Hold on.

1200
00:41:06,270 --> 00:41:09,110
"Steal half of the time
from a person chosen randomly."

1201
00:41:09,570 --> 00:41:11,400
Did Kyung-hwan get me?

1202
00:41:11,400 --> 00:41:12,570
(In the 3rd Room of Time)

1203
00:41:12,570 --> 00:41:13,610
He did?

1204
00:41:13,610 --> 00:41:16,570
(Kyung-hwan took
an hour and 50 minutes from him.)

1205
00:41:17,570 --> 00:41:18,920
(In the beginning of the race,
in the lobby...)

1206
00:41:18,920 --> 00:41:20,110
Be nice to me.

1207
00:41:20,110 --> 00:41:22,090
I got bitten by a zombie.

1208
00:41:22,380 --> 00:41:23,880
I might transform.

1209
00:41:24,060 --> 00:41:26,090
(Kyung-hwan was only pretending
to have a lot of time...)

1210
00:41:26,090 --> 00:41:28,150
(when he told Jong Kook
to run away.)

1211
00:41:28,250 --> 00:41:30,290
(Who will Jong Kook choose?)

1212
00:41:30,290 --> 00:41:32,070
I'll switch time with Kyung-hwan.

1213
00:41:32,420 --> 00:41:33,520
(Confident)

1214
00:41:34,020 --> 00:41:36,960
(He wants to switch time with
Kyung-hwan, who is in 2nd place.)

1215
00:41:37,070 --> 00:41:39,170
Jong Kook switched time with you.

1216
00:41:39,270 --> 00:41:40,360
He did?

1217
00:41:40,860 --> 00:41:41,980
He's so stupid.

1218
00:41:41,980 --> 00:41:43,710
(Why didn't he switch with Haha,
who is in 1st place?)

1219
00:41:43,710 --> 00:41:44,750
How much time do I have now?

1220
00:41:45,480 --> 00:41:46,610
Is that all?

1221
00:41:46,770 --> 00:41:47,940
Gosh!

1222
00:41:48,170 --> 00:41:50,750
He fooled me!

1223
00:41:50,750 --> 00:41:52,250
(Kyung-hwan, Jong Kook)

1224
00:41:52,250 --> 00:41:54,920
Why was I believing
Kyung-hwan had a lot of time?

1225
00:41:58,060 --> 00:42:00,560
(Kwang Soo runs to the Room of Time
a little late.)

1226
00:42:01,150 --> 00:42:02,230
Hey.

1227
00:42:02,790 --> 00:42:03,820
I was...

1228
00:42:03,820 --> 00:42:04,860
- Did you come here alone?
- Yes.

1229
00:42:04,960 --> 00:42:06,290
Why? Why did you rush here?

1230
00:42:06,290 --> 00:42:07,360
I'll be on my way.

1231
00:42:07,570 --> 00:42:08,590
(Where do you think you're going?)

1232
00:42:08,590 --> 00:42:09,960
Please!

1233
00:42:10,500 --> 00:42:11,900
(Kwang Soo, Jong Kook,)

1234
00:42:11,900 --> 00:42:13,170
(Kwang Soo's name tag is
ripped off.)

1235
00:42:13,170 --> 00:42:14,980
(Kwang Soo's 8 minutes and
39 seconds goes to Jong Kook.)

1236
00:42:14,980 --> 00:42:16,000
(Why did he even come here?)

1237
00:42:16,770 --> 00:42:18,440
Hey!

1238
00:42:18,440 --> 00:42:20,710
- Why did you...
- Gosh!

1239
00:42:20,770 --> 00:42:21,940
run straight to me?

1240
00:42:22,710 --> 00:42:24,710
I was actually a bit frustrated
after making a bad choice.

1241
00:42:25,590 --> 00:42:27,150
And you showed up.

1242
00:42:27,420 --> 00:42:28,590
Is the Room of Time over?

1243
00:42:28,920 --> 00:42:30,820
The fourth Room of Time is over.

1244
00:42:31,730 --> 00:42:37,190
(Haha, Jong Kook,
Kyung-hwan, Kwang Soo)

1245
00:42:37,250 --> 00:42:39,860
There's only one Room of Time left.

1246
00:42:39,960 --> 00:42:41,790
- There will be a twist.
- It's the last one.

1247
00:42:41,790 --> 00:42:43,540
We have the upper hand now.

1248
00:42:43,540 --> 00:42:45,110
(All of a sudden)

1249
00:42:46,540 --> 00:42:48,340
Why do we have the upper hand?

1250
00:42:48,340 --> 00:42:50,570
- We don't have much authority.
- Why not?

1251
00:42:50,570 --> 00:42:51,840
Just have a snack.

1252
00:42:52,310 --> 00:42:53,810
- Have a snack.
- I can take care of it.

1253
00:42:53,810 --> 00:42:56,480
Now that we have more people,

1254
00:42:56,650 --> 00:42:58,710
he seems to think
we can do something.

1255
00:43:00,090 --> 00:43:01,190
Wait and see.

1256
00:43:01,460 --> 00:43:02,560
It's not like that.

1257
00:43:02,960 --> 00:43:04,880
Here they come. Han Na and So Min.

1258
00:43:04,880 --> 00:43:06,420
(The new judges,
So Min and Han Na, join.)

1259
00:43:06,420 --> 00:43:07,820
Hurry up, the 4th and 5th judges!

1260
00:43:07,920 --> 00:43:09,020
Hello!

1261
00:43:09,020 --> 00:43:10,230
(Polite)

1262
00:43:10,230 --> 00:43:11,770
All right. Introduce yourselves.

1263
00:43:11,770 --> 00:43:13,730
- Hello.
- He's the first judge.

1264
00:43:13,730 --> 00:43:15,670
- Hello.
- Hello.

1265
00:43:16,360 --> 00:43:18,340
- Hello.
- He is in charge of arrangements.

1266
00:43:18,440 --> 00:43:21,000
- Have a seat.
- Let me give you...

1267
00:43:21,170 --> 00:43:23,710
- A little orientation?
- I'll give you a brief orientation.

1268
00:43:23,710 --> 00:43:24,880
- It's nothing much.
- Mr. Yu!

1269
00:43:24,980 --> 00:43:26,480
Let us start the drinking ceremony.

1270
00:43:27,940 --> 00:43:29,610
Let us start the drinking ceremony.

1271
00:43:29,610 --> 00:43:30,820
(A drinking ceremony,
all of a sudden?)

1272
00:43:30,820 --> 00:43:32,650
Stop it. We don't do that.

1273
00:43:32,650 --> 00:43:33,820
We don't do that.

1274
00:43:33,920 --> 00:43:36,290
I don't drink.
We don't do this kind of thing.

1275
00:43:36,920 --> 00:43:39,130
(The newbies are misled.)

1276
00:43:39,130 --> 00:43:40,960
- You just want to drink, right?
- We don't do that.

1277
00:43:41,320 --> 00:43:42,960
We stopped doing
a drinking ceremony a long time ago.

1278
00:43:42,960 --> 00:43:45,090
- We'll start a talent show now.
- Stop it.

1279
00:43:45,630 --> 00:43:47,270
Stop it now.

1280
00:43:47,630 --> 00:43:48,730
Also,

1281
00:43:48,730 --> 00:43:51,610
we're not at the center
of attention here.

1282
00:43:52,710 --> 00:43:54,000
- We're...
- We're on the sidelines.

1283
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:55,900
We're on the sidelines.

1284
00:43:55,980 --> 00:43:58,250
Let's go up to the 13th floor
and open...

1285
00:43:58,250 --> 00:43:59,380
No, why don't we...

1286
00:43:59,480 --> 00:44:00,570
- Let's go.
- Okay.

1287
00:44:00,570 --> 00:44:02,070
(They get going.)

1288
00:44:02,070 --> 00:44:03,110
- Hey.
- Let's go.

1289
00:44:03,110 --> 00:44:04,380
- If we go up now.
- We have to get going.

1290
00:44:04,380 --> 00:44:05,880
- Let's go.
- Guys.

1291
00:44:06,340 --> 00:44:07,750
- Guys!
- Hurry up.

1292
00:44:07,920 --> 00:44:10,060
If we go up now, we'll get caught.

1293
00:44:10,060 --> 00:44:11,090
Come on.

1294
00:44:13,730 --> 00:44:15,520
I should go downstairs and see...

1295
00:44:15,520 --> 00:44:16,560
(Haha is looking
for the other members.)

1296
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:18,020
I have to...

1297
00:44:18,920 --> 00:44:20,500
(Haha runs into Kwang Soo
who is barely alive.)

1298
00:44:20,500 --> 00:44:22,290
Come here.

1299
00:44:22,460 --> 00:44:24,290
- Do you want to join me or not?
- I want to.

1300
00:44:24,290 --> 00:44:25,500
You need time, don't you?

1301
00:44:25,730 --> 00:44:27,230
Follow me. I'll keep my hands
behind me.

1302
00:44:27,230 --> 00:44:28,540
(Kwang Soo has
neither time nor choice.)

1303
00:44:28,540 --> 00:44:29,570
Hurry up and push the button.

1304
00:44:29,570 --> 00:44:30,940
(I'll do as you say.)

1305
00:44:30,940 --> 00:44:32,610
Do you know where
the last Room of Time is?

1306
00:44:32,900 --> 00:44:34,710
- Suk Jin does.
- Okay.

1307
00:44:34,840 --> 00:44:37,710
If you and I hold hands...

1308
00:44:38,920 --> 00:44:40,040
Let me see.

1309
00:44:40,340 --> 00:44:42,690
How much time do you have?
50 minutes? 40 minutes?

1310
00:44:42,860 --> 00:44:44,820
- Yes. I'm worth it.
- You have 40 minutes?

1311
00:44:45,020 --> 00:44:46,090
Okay, let's stick together.

1312
00:44:47,790 --> 00:44:50,230
Come here. Stop looking away.

1313
00:44:51,770 --> 00:44:53,460
- Don't try to run away.
- Of course not.

1314
00:44:54,770 --> 00:44:57,190
- I'll be right back.
- Come here. Where are you going?

1315
00:44:58,570 --> 00:44:59,730
I need to find a name tag.

1316
00:44:59,730 --> 00:45:00,960
(Didn't you say you had 40 minutes?)

1317
00:45:01,570 --> 00:45:02,770
To be honest, I have
only about three minutes left.

1318
00:45:02,770 --> 00:45:04,810
(To be honest, I have
only about three minutes left.)

1319
00:45:04,810 --> 00:45:06,610
- You have only three minutes left?
- I'll be right back.

1320
00:45:06,610 --> 00:45:07,750
I'm sorry.

1321
00:45:08,040 --> 00:45:09,980
- I just want 10 more minutes.
- Hurry up.

1322
00:45:09,980 --> 00:45:11,040
(Haha is like a fisherman
releasing young fish.)

1323
00:45:11,040 --> 00:45:14,110
- Thank you!
- Are you looking for your name tag?

1324
00:45:14,420 --> 00:45:15,590
- Come here.
- Okay.

1325
00:45:15,920 --> 00:45:17,320
- Sir!
- Is this what you're looking for?

1326
00:45:17,320 --> 00:45:18,980
(Is this what you're looking for?)

1327
00:45:18,980 --> 00:45:20,360
- Sir!
- Is this what you're looking for?

1328
00:45:20,360 --> 00:45:21,900
Sir! If you give it to me...

1329
00:45:21,900 --> 00:45:23,190
If you give it to me...

1330
00:45:23,190 --> 00:45:25,190
- Is this what you're looking for?
- Just give me 10 minutes.

1331
00:45:25,230 --> 00:45:27,020
- Is this it?
- Yes. Give me 10 minutes.

1332
00:45:27,070 --> 00:45:29,460
- Do you have mine?
- No. I only have the others'.

1333
00:45:29,960 --> 00:45:31,290
- You were looking for this?
- This is driving me crazy.

1334
00:45:31,340 --> 00:45:33,770
- I'll give it to you if I find it.
- You can't find it anywhere, right?

1335
00:45:33,770 --> 00:45:35,270
(Thanks to Haha,
Kwang Soo gets 10 more minutes.)

1336
00:45:36,230 --> 00:45:37,940
(Kyung-hwan is in an elevator.)

1337
00:45:37,940 --> 00:45:38,980
Hey.

1338
00:45:39,150 --> 00:45:41,770
Why did you have to pretend?

1339
00:45:41,770 --> 00:45:43,270
You didn't have much time.

1340
00:45:43,270 --> 00:45:44,840
I should have switched with Haha!

1341
00:45:44,920 --> 00:45:46,590
I switched with you because
I thought you had a lot of time.

1342
00:45:47,150 --> 00:45:49,880
Why did you pretend?
You had less time than I did.

1343
00:45:50,960 --> 00:45:52,060
You did too.

1344
00:45:52,060 --> 00:45:53,630
What are you talking about?
I had plenty of time.

1345
00:45:53,630 --> 00:45:56,920
I had more than 3 hours.
I had almost 4 hours.

1346
00:45:57,250 --> 00:45:59,230
- Let's...
- You had almost nothing.

1347
00:45:59,770 --> 00:46:01,440
- Kwang Soo...
- Give me half of your time.

1348
00:46:01,440 --> 00:46:02,730
- Hold on.
- Come here!

1349
00:46:02,730 --> 00:46:04,360
- Wait.
- Gosh.

1350
00:46:04,440 --> 00:46:05,840
- Come here!
- Wait.

1351
00:46:05,840 --> 00:46:06,900
Gosh.

1352
00:46:06,900 --> 00:46:07,940
(Jong Kook gets 31 minutes.)

1353
00:46:07,940 --> 00:46:09,710
You had almost no time.
You were only pretending.

1354
00:46:09,840 --> 00:46:12,210
(Frustrated)

1355
00:46:13,310 --> 00:46:14,480
You had nothing.

1356
00:46:14,480 --> 00:46:17,040
Come here. We have to
work together to get Haha.

1357
00:46:17,570 --> 00:46:18,920
Why did I take your time away?

1358
00:46:18,920 --> 00:46:21,250
Because of you... Hold my hand.

1359
00:46:23,190 --> 00:46:25,980
Then let's go...
He's here. Jong Kook is here.

1360
00:46:26,730 --> 00:46:27,750
Jong Kook.

1361
00:46:27,750 --> 00:46:30,290
We can beat him if we join forces.

1362
00:46:30,290 --> 00:46:32,400
He is right. Why would you side
with him, you fool?

1363
00:46:32,400 --> 00:46:33,460
That's right. Come here.

1364
00:46:33,460 --> 00:46:34,960
- Let's hold hands.
- All right.

1365
00:46:34,960 --> 00:46:36,170
Think about it.

1366
00:46:36,590 --> 00:46:38,000
(But I gave you a name tag.)

1367
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:39,210
Hold on.

1368
00:46:39,710 --> 00:46:42,210
(Kwang Soo switches allegiance
right away.)

1369
00:46:42,210 --> 00:46:43,610
Hold on. For goodness' sake.

1370
00:46:43,880 --> 00:46:44,880
(His eyes change.)

1371
00:46:44,880 --> 00:46:46,570
- You are right.
- Hold on.

1372
00:46:46,570 --> 00:46:48,380
- Hold on. Hold on.
- Hurry up and rip his name tag.

1373
00:46:48,380 --> 00:46:49,840
- Hold on.
- We need to bring him down.

1374
00:46:49,840 --> 00:46:51,980
- Hold on. Hold on.
- Hurry up and hold him.

1375
00:46:51,980 --> 00:46:53,710
Rip off his name tag.
We don't need to listen to him.

1376
00:46:53,710 --> 00:46:55,250
(They spring to action
without hesitation.)

1377
00:46:55,650 --> 00:46:56,920
Rip off his name tag.
We don't need to listen to him.

1378
00:46:56,920 --> 00:46:58,920
(They grab at
each other's name tag.)

1379
00:46:58,920 --> 00:46:59,980
(Ripping)

1380
00:47:00,320 --> 00:47:03,320
(Haha removed
Kyung-hwan's name tag first.)

1381
00:47:04,920 --> 00:47:07,630
You kneeled in front of me
this whole time too.

1382
00:47:08,190 --> 00:47:09,900
Who knew
people could change so much?

1383
00:47:09,900 --> 00:47:11,770
- Seriously.
- What are those people?

1384
00:47:11,770 --> 00:47:13,460
What are those people?
Gosh, they startled me.

1385
00:47:13,940 --> 00:47:15,900
(What are those people?)

1386
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:17,670
- Hey.
- What are those people?

1387
00:47:17,670 --> 00:47:19,380
- Gosh, they startled me.
- Hey.

1388
00:47:19,400 --> 00:47:20,710
"Minions" or "Us."

1389
00:47:20,710 --> 00:47:22,770
You guys look like the Minions.

1390
00:47:22,980 --> 00:47:24,070
"Us."

1391
00:47:24,070 --> 00:47:25,980
- "Us."
- We remind you of "Us," right?

1392
00:47:25,980 --> 00:47:27,290
I was so startled.

1393
00:47:27,290 --> 00:47:28,790
("Us")

1394
00:47:28,790 --> 00:47:30,190
You look so scary.

1395
00:47:30,190 --> 00:47:31,250
- "Us."
- What is going on?

1396
00:47:31,250 --> 00:47:33,980
We are moving toward
the grand finale.

1397
00:47:33,980 --> 00:47:35,520
- The result is out.
- Okay.

1398
00:47:36,150 --> 00:47:37,650
Haha removed Kyung-hwan's name tag.

1399
00:47:38,770 --> 00:47:41,230
(The result could change
the ranking.)

1400
00:47:41,230 --> 00:47:43,070
- Haha lost half of his time.
- Yes!

1401
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:46,270
(The trio's combined time
was greater than Haha's.)

1402
00:47:46,270 --> 00:47:48,630
(They succeeded
to keep Haha in check.)

1403
00:47:48,630 --> 00:47:50,230
- Okay, okay. I get it.
- Haha just lost his time.

1404
00:47:50,840 --> 00:47:52,610
(Haha loses 1 hour and 15 minutes.)

1405
00:47:52,610 --> 00:47:56,170
(Haha, Jong Kook,
Kyung-hwan, and Kwang Soo)

1406
00:47:56,170 --> 00:47:59,150
Now, it all depends on when we open
the Room of Time.

1407
00:47:59,250 --> 00:48:00,710
This place is so pretty.

1408
00:48:00,710 --> 00:48:01,710
Here.

1409
00:48:01,710 --> 00:48:03,060
(The last Room of Time could change
the final outcome.)

1410
00:48:03,060 --> 00:48:05,790
- How unique!
- It all depends on when we open it.

1411
00:48:06,360 --> 00:48:07,750
When should we open it?

1412
00:48:07,750 --> 00:48:09,860
Let's follow the judges.
They are up to something.

1413
00:48:09,860 --> 00:48:11,000
As we passed by them earlier...

1414
00:48:11,060 --> 00:48:13,020
Guys.

1415
00:48:13,130 --> 00:48:16,460
This isn't how you do things.
You should wait on the first judge.

1416
00:48:16,460 --> 00:48:18,360
The fifth Room of Time is open.

1417
00:48:18,360 --> 00:48:19,500
It's open. Go in.

1418
00:48:19,610 --> 00:48:20,900
- Kwang Soo.
- It isn't open yet.

1419
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:25,380
(Kwang Soo charges upon hearing
that it's open.)

1420
00:48:25,380 --> 00:48:26,380
It isn't open yet.

1421
00:48:26,380 --> 00:48:27,880
- It isn't open yet.
- It isn't open yet.

1422
00:48:27,880 --> 00:48:29,320
- You can't go in yet.
- Is it closed?

1423
00:48:29,320 --> 00:48:30,520
- Go in.
- Is it closed?

1424
00:48:30,520 --> 00:48:32,420
- It's closed.
- It's closed.

1425
00:48:32,420 --> 00:48:36,150
You need to spin the roulette
anyway.

1426
00:48:36,150 --> 00:48:39,590
How could you be so rude to us
by running off without a thank you?

1427
00:48:39,590 --> 00:48:41,590
- Thank you.
- You were kneeling earlier.

1428
00:48:41,590 --> 00:48:44,360
I think I have 1 or 2 minutes left.

1429
00:48:45,090 --> 00:48:46,690
- Do you have two minutes left?
- Yes.

1430
00:48:46,690 --> 00:48:48,570
- So...
- Shall we wait three minutes?

1431
00:48:48,690 --> 00:48:50,170
Please give me a chance.

1432
00:48:50,670 --> 00:48:54,360
It would be entertaining
if Kwang Soo gets eliminated.

1433
00:48:54,360 --> 00:48:56,570
- The two of us...
- Kwang Soo is out.

1434
00:48:57,770 --> 00:49:00,000
(As soon as Jong Kook finishes
his sentence,)

1435
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:02,340
(an entertaining situation occurs.)

1436
00:49:02,340 --> 00:49:04,380
(I said I don't have much time.)

1437
00:49:04,880 --> 00:49:06,650
- Hey.
- Congratulations.

1438
00:49:07,150 --> 00:49:08,650
You are done.

1439
00:49:08,860 --> 00:49:10,210
Go and change.

1440
00:49:10,210 --> 00:49:11,250
This is scary.

1441
00:49:11,250 --> 00:49:12,320
I started the day
with 3 hours and 30 minutes.

1442
00:49:12,320 --> 00:49:13,730
Go and change.

1443
00:49:13,730 --> 00:49:16,750
- An hour ago, he had 4 hours.
- The uniform is on the 14th floor.

1444
00:49:16,750 --> 00:49:18,190
I had four hours.

1445
00:49:18,190 --> 00:49:19,820
Listen. All of the judges...

1446
00:49:19,820 --> 00:49:22,290
- had a lot of time.
- You have a point.

1447
00:49:22,290 --> 00:49:24,500
- Nothing is permanent.
- You are right.

1448
00:49:24,500 --> 00:49:26,400
- Go.
- Go to the 14th floor.

1449
00:49:26,400 --> 00:49:27,940
- I will go and change.
- Okay.

1450
00:49:27,940 --> 00:49:29,110
It's one floor above.

1451
00:49:31,040 --> 00:49:34,040
(Haha, Jong Kook, and Kyung-hwan)

1452
00:49:34,940 --> 00:49:36,480
Let me enter the Room of Time.

1453
00:49:36,480 --> 00:49:37,840
Let's play rock-paper-scissors.

1454
00:49:37,880 --> 00:49:40,790
- Rock-paper-scissors?
- I shouldn't go too easy on you.

1455
00:49:40,840 --> 00:49:42,960
- We will open the room.
- Go ahead.

1456
00:49:42,960 --> 00:49:45,380
(The final outcome depends on
who enters the room.)

1457
00:49:45,380 --> 00:49:47,150
(The last Room of Time opens.)

1458
00:49:47,150 --> 00:49:49,090
The fifth Room of Time is open.

1459
00:49:49,090 --> 00:49:51,020
Whoever enters the room will win.

1460
00:49:51,020 --> 00:49:53,460
- The chance is high.
- It depends on the roulette.

1461
00:49:53,460 --> 00:49:55,090
- It does depend on the roulette.
<i>- Rock-paper-scissors</i>

1462
00:49:55,090 --> 00:49:56,770
(It's the last Room of Time.)

1463
00:49:57,040 --> 00:49:59,940
<i>Rock-paper-scissors</i>

1464
00:50:00,130 --> 00:50:01,810
(Kyung-hwan wins.)

1465
00:50:02,400 --> 00:50:03,540
Are you just going to let him enter?

1466
00:50:03,540 --> 00:50:06,170
- I am not the type to fight.
- He could get a dud.

1467
00:50:06,170 --> 00:50:07,210
That's right.

1468
00:50:07,210 --> 00:50:08,420
Here I go.

1469
00:50:08,420 --> 00:50:09,940
(He used his time
as the admission fee.)

1470
00:50:10,920 --> 00:50:12,020
Here I go.

1471
00:50:12,020 --> 00:50:14,040
(Kyung-hwan spun the roulette.)

1472
00:50:14,040 --> 00:50:16,710
(What will be the result
of his last chance?)

1473
00:50:16,710 --> 00:50:20,380
(Steal half of the time
from a person chosen randomly.)

1474
00:50:20,380 --> 00:50:22,630
Steal half of the time
from a person chosen randomly.

1475
00:50:22,630 --> 00:50:24,130
What?

1476
00:50:24,130 --> 00:50:26,170
(Steal half of the time
from a person chosen randomly?)

1477
00:50:26,860 --> 00:50:28,230
One of the slips has
Jong Kook's name.

1478
00:50:28,230 --> 00:50:29,860
You should steal Jong Kook's time
and rip off Haha's name tag.

1479
00:50:31,440 --> 00:50:34,810
(If he steals Haha's time,
he gets 35 minutes.)

1480
00:50:35,770 --> 00:50:38,940
(But it's not enough
to make him the top 1.)

1481
00:50:39,270 --> 00:50:42,980
(If he steals Jong Kook's time,
he gets 1 hour and 10 minutes.)

1482
00:50:43,540 --> 00:50:45,540
- That way, you will win.
- That's right.

1483
00:50:45,540 --> 00:50:46,610
(With half of Jong Kook's time,
he will be the top 1.)

1484
00:50:47,750 --> 00:50:48,860
Hurry up, will you?

1485
00:50:48,860 --> 00:50:49,880
(Kyung-hwan got...)

1486
00:50:49,880 --> 00:50:51,360
- Junior judge.
- That's right.

1487
00:50:51,360 --> 00:50:54,730
(Jong Kook!)

1488
00:50:54,730 --> 00:50:58,360
(Kyung-hwan gained
1 hour and 30 minutes.)

1489
00:50:58,360 --> 00:51:01,520
(Jong Kook lost
1 hour and 30 minutes.)

1490
00:51:01,520 --> 00:51:03,570
(With half of Jong Kook's time,
Kyung-hwan became the top 1!)

1491
00:51:03,570 --> 00:51:05,960
I have no hope. Hold on.

1492
00:51:06,130 --> 00:51:08,670
Should I team up with Haha
and remove Kyung-hwan's name tag?

1493
00:51:08,670 --> 00:51:09,730
No. Hold on.

1494
00:51:10,170 --> 00:51:11,840
If I team up with Haha
and remove Kyung-hwan's name tag...

1495
00:51:11,840 --> 00:51:12,840
(What should I do?)

1496
00:51:12,840 --> 00:51:15,480
How much time does Haha have?
I need to find Haha.

1497
00:51:16,270 --> 00:51:18,270
(Haha gets a call.)

1498
00:51:19,940 --> 00:51:21,040
Jong Kook.

1499
00:51:21,110 --> 00:51:24,520
Let's team up
and take out Kyung-hwan.

1500
00:51:25,230 --> 00:51:27,690
- Okay.
- Then we can have a face-off.

1501
00:51:27,690 --> 00:51:29,590
- Come down to the 9th floor.
- The 9th floor? Okay.

1502
00:51:29,590 --> 00:51:31,790
- Okay. Come to the back door.
- Okay.

1503
00:51:31,790 --> 00:51:34,000
(He quickly moves to the location.)

1504
00:51:34,770 --> 00:51:35,900
Kyung-hwan.

1505
00:51:35,900 --> 00:51:38,170
Jong Kook called me and suggested
that we take you out.

1506
00:51:38,170 --> 00:51:41,570
It will be a fight
between the two of you anyway.

1507
00:51:41,570 --> 00:51:43,170
- So...
- Hurry up, Haha.

1508
00:51:44,130 --> 00:51:45,170
Haha.

1509
00:51:45,610 --> 00:51:46,650
Hurry up.

1510
00:51:46,650 --> 00:51:48,250
Yes. Jong Kook is here.

1511
00:51:48,440 --> 00:51:49,570
Jong Kook.

1512
00:51:52,250 --> 00:51:53,710
I will go to the ninth floor.

1513
00:51:53,710 --> 00:51:55,320
(Kyung-hwan moves
to the meeting place.)

1514
00:51:57,290 --> 00:51:59,560
- We can join forces.
- Let's go.

1515
00:51:59,560 --> 00:52:01,790
I guess I can take you out
then go after him.

1516
00:52:03,290 --> 00:52:05,590
- Let me take off your name tag.
- This is exhausting.

1517
00:52:05,590 --> 00:52:06,730
Jong Kook.

1518
00:52:06,730 --> 00:52:09,270
(Kyung-hwan arrives!)

1519
00:52:12,710 --> 00:52:13,860
Hey.

1520
00:52:14,110 --> 00:52:15,940
- Jong Kook.
- Couldn't you hold on?

1521
00:52:17,340 --> 00:52:18,500
What do you mean?

1522
00:52:19,110 --> 00:52:20,270
I did that so far.

1523
00:52:20,650 --> 00:52:21,750
Jong Kook.

1524
00:52:21,750 --> 00:52:23,210
- Listen.
- Let's stop.

1525
00:52:23,210 --> 00:52:25,190
Let's stop.

1526
00:52:25,610 --> 00:52:27,110
Jong Kook doesn't have much time.

1527
00:52:27,110 --> 00:52:29,210
- What?
- Why do you have so little time?

1528
00:52:29,560 --> 00:52:30,750
Haha, come to me.

1529
00:52:31,420 --> 00:52:32,880
- It can't be helped.
- Okay.

1530
00:52:32,880 --> 00:52:34,190
- We need to finish this.
- I am sorry.

1531
00:52:34,860 --> 00:52:36,590
(Did Haha choose to side
with Kyung-hwan?)

1532
00:52:36,590 --> 00:52:37,860
It can't be helped.

1533
00:52:37,860 --> 00:52:39,630
We need to finish this.

1534
00:52:39,630 --> 00:52:40,690
Haha, hold my hand.

1535
00:52:42,170 --> 00:52:44,090
- Okay. I am done anyway.
- Yes.

1536
00:52:44,090 --> 00:52:45,210
(Is he giving up?)

1537
00:52:45,210 --> 00:52:46,400
Fine. Rip off my name tag.

1538
00:52:46,610 --> 00:52:47,840
- What?
- Rip off my name tag.

1539
00:52:48,500 --> 00:52:49,710
Should I do it here?

1540
00:52:49,710 --> 00:52:52,210
- Go ahead.
- Why would you do it elsewhere?

1541
00:52:52,210 --> 00:52:54,310
(His hand goes
for Jong Kook's name tag.)

1542
00:52:56,840 --> 00:52:58,250
The race is over.

1543
00:52:58,250 --> 00:53:00,250
- What happened?
- The race is over.

1544
00:53:00,250 --> 00:53:01,320
Kyung-hwan, what happened?

1545
00:53:01,480 --> 00:53:03,480
- Did Kyung-hwan win?
- I finally made it on Running Man.

1546
00:53:03,710 --> 00:53:04,980
- Did you make it?
- He is really cool.

1547
00:53:04,980 --> 00:53:06,690
Seeing as how you moved to the side,
you can't be the winner.

1548
00:53:06,690 --> 00:53:07,750
I don't think you won.

1549
00:53:07,750 --> 00:53:09,520
- Jong Kook, did you win?
- He rose from the bottom.

1550
00:53:09,520 --> 00:53:12,460
Congratulations. The final winner
of the Countdown Race is...

1551
00:53:19,140 --> 00:53:20,510
- Kim Jong Kook.
- How?

1552
00:53:20,760 --> 00:53:23,860
(The winner is Jong Kook,
not Kyung-hwan.)

1553
00:53:24,220 --> 00:53:25,430
How about this?

1554
00:53:25,430 --> 00:53:26,990
I rip off your name tag
about two times.

1555
00:53:27,200 --> 00:53:28,550
Then I get more time, right?

1556
00:53:28,550 --> 00:53:31,490
Then you team up with Kyung-hwan
without much time.

1557
00:53:31,570 --> 00:53:33,860
When Kyung-hwan
confidently rips off your name tag,

1558
00:53:33,860 --> 00:53:35,570
I will rip off his name tag.
How does that sound?

1559
00:53:35,660 --> 00:53:37,240
What do I get out of this?

1560
00:53:37,510 --> 00:53:39,140
- I will give you the prize.
- Really?

1561
00:53:39,140 --> 00:53:40,970
I will gain honor
and you will gain the prize.

1562
00:53:41,280 --> 00:53:42,840
- "Show Me the Money"!
- Yes.

1563
00:53:42,910 --> 00:53:45,180
- How does that sound?
- This is a pretty good deal.

1564
00:53:45,180 --> 00:53:46,240
Right?

1565
00:53:46,550 --> 00:53:47,840
(Haha, Jong Kook)

1566
00:53:47,840 --> 00:53:50,010
Rip off my name tag. Take my time.

1567
00:53:50,010 --> 00:53:51,910
(Haha lost 33 minutes
and Jong Kook gained 33 minutes.)

1568
00:53:51,910 --> 00:53:55,010
(He transferred time
to Jong Kook as promised.)

1569
00:53:55,010 --> 00:53:57,890
Gosh, I don't even know.

1570
00:53:57,890 --> 00:53:59,860
(Haha lost 16 minutes
and Jong Kook gained 16 minutes.)

1571
00:53:59,950 --> 00:54:02,160
(When Kyung-hwan moved in
to rip off Jong Kook's name tag)

1572
00:54:02,820 --> 00:54:04,200
Haha.

1573
00:54:04,200 --> 00:54:05,970
What are you doing?

1574
00:54:06,470 --> 00:54:10,090
(Jong Kook had more time
than Kyung-hwan.)

1575
00:54:10,390 --> 00:54:11,840
What are you doing?
What are you doing?

1576
00:54:11,840 --> 00:54:13,300
(Jong Kook attacked
without hesitation.)

1577
00:54:13,300 --> 00:54:14,410
What are you doing?

1578
00:54:14,410 --> 00:54:15,680
(Ripping)

1579
00:54:17,610 --> 00:54:20,820
(He gained Kyung-hwan's time
and became the winner.)

1580
00:54:21,610 --> 00:54:23,840
The Room of Time is closed.

1581
00:54:23,840 --> 00:54:25,280
Since Jong Kook has more time...

1582
00:54:25,280 --> 00:54:27,090
than the rest of the members'
combined time,

1583
00:54:27,090 --> 00:54:28,610
we will end the race.

1584
00:54:29,820 --> 00:54:32,280
- Yes!
- I didn't know it would be so good.

1585
00:54:32,280 --> 00:54:33,320
It's Korean beef!

1586
00:54:33,320 --> 00:54:34,700
I didn't know
the prize would be Korean beef.

1587
00:54:34,720 --> 00:54:36,550
I didn't know
the prize would be Korean beef.

1588
00:54:36,550 --> 00:54:38,360
This is better than honor.

1589
00:54:38,360 --> 00:54:41,070
Let's have Han Na and Kyung-hwan
in the center.

1590
00:54:41,070 --> 00:54:42,840
- Come here.
- Kyung-hwan looks happy.

1591
00:54:42,840 --> 00:54:44,860
- Kyung-hwan.
- He thinks he was funny today.

1592
00:54:44,970 --> 00:54:46,700
They are like a family...

1593
00:54:46,700 --> 00:54:48,840
who always join us for Running Man.
We thank...

1594
00:54:48,840 --> 00:54:49,970
- Kyung-hwan...
- Thank you.

1595
00:54:49,970 --> 00:54:52,010
- and Han Na.
- Thank you.

1596
00:54:53,140 --> 00:54:56,720
- Hello.
- Hello.

1597
00:54:56,720 --> 00:54:59,610
I was shocked when I took
a shower after the last shoot.

1598
00:54:59,610 --> 00:55:03,390
- Why?
- My thigh was bruised.

1599
00:55:03,490 --> 00:55:04,660
The strawberry game.

1600
00:55:04,660 --> 00:55:06,860
- You played too much of it.
- My palms hurt so much.

1601
00:55:06,860 --> 00:55:10,550
I was wondering
how I got that bruise.

1602
00:55:10,660 --> 00:55:13,220
You kept on criticizing yourself.

1603
00:55:13,430 --> 00:55:14,470
"Jae Suk".

1604
00:55:14,470 --> 00:55:17,570
When his name was called,
he went straight from this to this.

1605
00:55:17,570 --> 00:55:18,970
(Young Gu mode)

1606
00:55:18,970 --> 00:55:20,930
<i>St-raw-berry, st-raw-berry</i>

1607
00:55:21,030 --> 00:55:24,300
(He's an experienced comedian,
but he still gets really nervous.)

1608
00:55:24,300 --> 00:55:26,280
- Jae Suk is so...
- He was so bad.

1609
00:55:26,280 --> 00:55:29,140
There are two guests
who will be joining you.

1610
00:55:29,140 --> 00:55:30,570
- Really?
- Really?

1611
00:55:30,570 --> 00:55:32,550
Come on out, guests.

1612
00:55:32,780 --> 00:55:34,360
Let's welcome them.

1613
00:55:34,950 --> 00:55:36,550
Gosh, Shin Hae Sun.

1614
00:55:36,550 --> 00:55:37,950
Hello.

1615
00:55:37,950 --> 00:55:39,590
Jong Ok.

1616
00:55:39,590 --> 00:55:41,300
Hae Sun.

1617
00:55:42,030 --> 00:55:45,660
(She can play roles
that are both charming...)

1618
00:55:45,660 --> 00:55:48,570
(and require deep emotions.)

1619
00:55:48,570 --> 00:55:51,570
(Actress Shin Hae Sun is
the hitmaker of films and dramas.)

1620
00:55:52,570 --> 00:55:54,700
(With 35 years of experience,)

1621
00:55:54,700 --> 00:55:57,950
(she plays a wide range of roles.)

1622
00:55:57,950 --> 00:56:01,240
(Bae Jong Ok is Korea's favorite
girl crush actress.)

1623
00:56:01,240 --> 00:56:02,320
- Hae Sun.
- Hello.

1624
00:56:02,320 --> 00:56:03,950
- Hello.
- How have you been?

1625
00:56:03,950 --> 00:56:05,280
- Hello.
- Come this way.

1626
00:56:05,280 --> 00:56:06,410
Hello.

1627
00:56:06,410 --> 00:56:08,280
- Jong Ok.
- Nice seeing you again, Kwang Soo.

1628
00:56:08,280 --> 00:56:09,450
- Long time, no see.
- It's been a long time.

1629
00:56:09,450 --> 00:56:11,430
- Hello.
- Hello.

1630
00:56:11,430 --> 00:56:14,160
It's very nice seeing you two.

1631
00:56:14,160 --> 00:56:16,660
She hasn't changed at all.

1632
00:56:16,660 --> 00:56:20,030
Please say hi first.

1633
00:56:20,030 --> 00:56:22,570
- Please say hi formally.
- Should I go first?

1634
00:56:22,570 --> 00:56:23,660
- Yes, go first.
- This is fascinating.

1635
00:56:23,930 --> 00:56:25,470
- Where should I look?
- Doesn't matter.

1636
00:56:25,470 --> 00:56:26,610
I see.

1637
00:56:27,340 --> 00:56:28,880
(He's mean to outsiders.)

1638
00:56:28,880 --> 00:56:31,110
- Hold on.
- Why would you say that?

1639
00:56:31,110 --> 00:56:32,280
You're being mean to guests.

1640
00:56:32,280 --> 00:56:33,950
- You were so rude.
- "Doesn't matter."

1641
00:56:33,950 --> 00:56:36,470
- Why would you say that?
- Don't be hurt.

1642
00:56:36,470 --> 00:56:37,590
I won't.

1643
00:56:37,590 --> 00:56:40,320
It's because he's an old fossil.

1644
00:56:40,320 --> 00:56:41,550
(Goodness)

1645
00:56:41,550 --> 00:56:43,590
- What's wrong?
- I'm in a daze.

1646
00:56:44,360 --> 00:56:46,430
- That was nothing.
- Stop it.

1647
00:56:46,430 --> 00:56:47,660
(That was nothing.)

1648
00:56:47,660 --> 00:56:48,860
(Old fossil Jee's
harsh variety show training)

1649
00:56:48,860 --> 00:56:50,590
- What's wrong with him?
- Why are you intimidating her?

1650
00:56:50,590 --> 00:56:52,070
Stop it.

1651
00:56:52,070 --> 00:56:54,030
Should I make him faint?

1652
00:56:54,030 --> 00:56:55,660
Why are you being mean?

1653
00:56:55,660 --> 00:56:56,840
I wanted to make her
feel comfortable.

1654
00:56:56,840 --> 00:56:59,700
These two starred...

1655
00:56:59,700 --> 00:57:02,110
in a movie called "Innocence."

1656
00:57:02,110 --> 00:57:05,610
Can you tell us
what the movie is about?

1657
00:57:06,010 --> 00:57:07,200
(Tap)

1658
00:57:08,380 --> 00:57:09,740
Sure.

1659
00:57:09,740 --> 00:57:12,090
(Her right hand is
the helping hand.)

1660
00:57:12,090 --> 00:57:13,910
You have strict rules.

1661
00:57:13,910 --> 00:57:15,820
I think Hae Sun...

1662
00:57:15,820 --> 00:57:18,450
Hae Sun handed it to her in
two hands, and she tossed it back.

1663
00:57:18,450 --> 00:57:20,950
- "You do it."
- "Take care of it."

1664
00:57:20,950 --> 00:57:22,490
They have strict rules.

1665
00:57:22,490 --> 00:57:24,090
She's an aide.

1666
00:57:24,160 --> 00:57:27,700
Jong Ok doesn't
beat around the bush.

1667
00:57:27,700 --> 00:57:29,700
She's very direct, right?

1668
00:57:29,700 --> 00:57:30,840
- Right.
- Yes.

1669
00:57:30,840 --> 00:57:32,860
She's very cool and friendly.

1670
00:57:32,860 --> 00:57:35,430
Is that right?
You look very intimidated.

1671
00:57:35,430 --> 00:57:36,430
No.

1672
00:57:36,430 --> 00:57:37,840
- Hae Sun.
- That's not true.

1673
00:57:37,840 --> 00:57:39,840
- That's not true.
- Tell us.

1674
00:57:39,840 --> 00:57:41,140
- You don't look natural.
- That's so not true.

1675
00:57:41,140 --> 00:57:42,550
- You don't look natural.
- You don't look close.

1676
00:57:42,550 --> 00:57:45,110
She was standing a foot away,

1677
00:57:45,110 --> 00:57:47,320
but when the topic was
about her and Jong Ok,

1678
00:57:47,320 --> 00:57:48,680
she was like, "That's not true."

1679
00:57:48,680 --> 00:57:52,130
- You saw her. She brushed her away.
- I know.

1680
00:57:52,490 --> 00:57:53,930
It's not like that.

1681
00:57:53,930 --> 00:57:56,950
"Innocence" is a movie...

1682
00:57:56,950 --> 00:58:01,030
about a lawyer
who defends her mom...

1683
00:58:01,030 --> 00:58:04,410
who has been falsely accused
of murder.

1684
00:58:04,410 --> 00:58:06,430
It's a story between
the mother and daughter.

1685
00:58:06,430 --> 00:58:07,780
- We have to watch this.
- You're mother and daughter.

1686
00:58:07,780 --> 00:58:08,800
I'm the lawyer.

1687
00:58:08,800 --> 00:58:11,240
Is it going to be released
at the same time as "Intruder"?

1688
00:58:11,550 --> 00:58:12,640
- March.
- Really?

1689
00:58:12,640 --> 00:58:13,950
March.

1690
00:58:14,280 --> 00:58:15,840
When?

1691
00:58:15,840 --> 00:58:17,050
In March too.

1692
00:58:17,050 --> 00:58:19,050
Oh, gosh.

1693
00:58:19,050 --> 00:58:21,280
It'll be great
if both movies do well.

1694
00:58:21,280 --> 00:58:24,760
- That'll be good.
- We'll both do good.

1695
00:58:24,760 --> 00:58:26,450
Both movies have to do well.

1696
00:58:26,450 --> 00:58:27,820
- Let's watch both.
- Sure.

1697
00:58:27,820 --> 00:58:29,550
Moo Yul.

1698
00:58:29,550 --> 00:58:30,970
- Moo Yul.
- Come on the show.

1699
00:58:30,970 --> 00:58:32,470
- Why is he not here?
- I don't know.

1700
00:58:32,470 --> 00:58:35,360
- He has to go around.
- Come on the show.

1701
00:58:35,360 --> 00:58:36,700
"Moo Yul".

1702
00:58:36,700 --> 00:58:38,360
Why is he not here?

1703
00:58:38,360 --> 00:58:42,030
This is Jong Ok's first time
on Running Man.

1704
00:58:42,030 --> 00:58:44,140
How do you feel?

1705
00:58:44,140 --> 00:58:46,570
I don't know if I can chase you.

1706
00:58:46,570 --> 00:58:48,450
- I feel very pressured,
- Is that right?

1707
00:58:48,450 --> 00:58:50,470
but I have Suk Jin,
so I think it'll be okay.

1708
00:58:50,470 --> 00:58:52,390
We'll walk when others run.

1709
00:58:52,390 --> 00:58:54,110
Yes, we'll walk.

1710
00:58:54,110 --> 00:58:56,660
Move your upper body fast and walk.

1711
00:58:56,660 --> 00:58:59,160
When you can't think,
lean on the young people.

1712
00:58:59,160 --> 00:59:01,450
Of course. Listen carefully
and catch what they say.

1713
00:59:01,450 --> 00:59:03,860
Say it like it was your idea.

1714
00:59:03,860 --> 00:59:05,160
That's good.

1715
00:59:05,320 --> 00:59:07,160
- That's what he did.
- He knew.

1716
00:59:07,320 --> 00:59:09,490
He knew and acted that way.

1717
00:59:09,490 --> 00:59:12,410
Omit what they say
and add your own lines.

1718
00:59:12,410 --> 00:59:13,860
You'll look smart.

1719
00:59:13,860 --> 00:59:15,700
You just need three of those.

1720
00:59:15,700 --> 00:59:18,470
I guess he doesn't watch himself.

1721
00:59:18,470 --> 00:59:19,570
What?

1722
00:59:19,740 --> 00:59:21,050
- They don't omit anything.
- I know.

1723
00:59:21,050 --> 00:59:23,220
I guess he doesn't read
the comments either.

1724
00:59:23,220 --> 00:59:24,840
Stop it.

1725
00:59:24,840 --> 00:59:28,010
Hae Sun is here with Jong Ok.

1726
00:59:28,160 --> 00:59:29,410
You don't look in that direction.

1727
00:59:29,410 --> 00:59:30,930
- No, I don't know where to look.
- Why not?

1728
00:59:30,930 --> 00:59:33,030
I never made eye contact with her.

1729
00:59:33,030 --> 00:59:34,860
- Me neither.
- She didn't look in that direction.

1730
00:59:34,860 --> 00:59:36,660
I didn't see beyond this.

1731
00:59:36,660 --> 00:59:38,160
I'm actually more comfortable
on this side.

1732
00:59:38,160 --> 00:59:39,430
- Right?
- I know what you mean.

1733
00:59:39,430 --> 00:59:41,430
- That side is more comfortable.
- I know what you mean.

1734
00:59:41,430 --> 00:59:42,970
Their looks are below average,
so our side is more comfortable.

1735
00:59:42,970 --> 00:59:44,070
I agree.

1736
00:59:44,070 --> 00:59:45,260
I'm looking straight ahead,
and I feel at ease.

1737
00:59:45,260 --> 00:59:46,340
I see.

1738
00:59:46,340 --> 00:59:48,380
The back of his head
also makes me feel at ease.

1739
00:59:48,380 --> 00:59:49,910
- The back of his head?
- Hey, thanks.

1740
00:59:49,910 --> 00:59:50,910
(You make me feel at ease too.)

1741
00:59:51,280 --> 00:59:52,950
Thanks for making me feel at ease.

1742
00:59:52,950 --> 00:59:55,050
- Because of me?
- Yes, I only stand next to you.

1743
00:59:55,050 --> 00:59:56,740
No wonder.

1744
00:59:56,740 --> 00:59:57,950
The two pairs on Running Man.

1745
00:59:57,950 --> 00:59:59,110
What?

1746
00:59:59,110 --> 01:00:00,590
- Two pairs?
- Such comfortable people.

1747
01:00:00,590 --> 01:00:02,160
- Ridiculous.
- This is driving me nuts.

1748
01:00:02,160 --> 01:00:03,590
- Protuberant Brothers.
- Goodness.

1749
01:00:03,590 --> 01:00:04,760
What Protuberant Brothers?

1750
01:00:04,760 --> 01:00:06,820
Protuberant Brothers.

1751
01:00:07,320 --> 01:00:10,130
Today is the Indoor Special Part 2:

1752
01:00:10,130 --> 01:00:13,760
- Decide Bag, Innocence Race.
- Innocence Race.

1753
01:00:13,760 --> 01:00:16,390
When actors are guests,
they are moved here.

1754
01:00:16,390 --> 01:00:17,930
- The title.
- Our title is...

1755
01:00:17,930 --> 01:00:19,760
- related to the movie title.
- It's great.

1756
01:00:19,760 --> 01:00:21,680
We're good with play on words.

1757
01:00:21,680 --> 01:00:23,300
It doesn't sound bad either.

1758
01:00:23,640 --> 01:00:24,840
Decide Bag.

1759
01:00:24,840 --> 01:00:27,380
Decide Bag, Innocence Race
will be played in two teams.

1760
01:00:27,380 --> 01:00:31,450
The two teams are
Team Jong Ok and Team Hae Sun.

1761
01:00:31,450 --> 01:00:34,050
As you see,
in the good and bad zones,

1762
01:00:34,050 --> 01:00:36,010
there are 30 bags each.

1763
01:00:36,010 --> 01:00:38,660
The good zone has 19 plus values,

1764
01:00:38,660 --> 01:00:41,950
9 minus values, 1 switch chance,
and 1 double chance.

1765
01:00:41,950 --> 01:00:43,550
There are 30 bags in total.

1766
01:00:43,550 --> 01:00:44,760
In contrast, the bad zone has...

1767
01:00:44,760 --> 01:00:47,260
9 plus values, 19 minus values,

1768
01:00:47,260 --> 01:00:48,890
1 switch chance,
and 1 double chance.

1769
01:00:48,890 --> 01:00:50,490
There are 30 bags as well.

1770
01:00:50,490 --> 01:00:51,570
The chance to switch sounds good.

1771
01:00:51,570 --> 01:00:52,930
After playing three rounds of games,

1772
01:00:52,930 --> 01:00:55,880
the winning team can each choose
a bag from the good zone.

1773
01:00:55,880 --> 01:00:58,740
The losing team has to choose a bag
from the bad zone.

1774
01:00:58,740 --> 01:01:00,340
(Each member of the losing team
chooses a bag from the bad zone.)

1775
01:01:00,780 --> 01:01:04,390
After each round, the rankings
and your amount will be revealed.

1776
01:01:04,390 --> 01:01:05,590
At the end of the race,

1777
01:01:05,590 --> 01:01:08,220
1st and 2nd places
with the most money will win prizes.

1778
01:01:08,220 --> 01:01:11,260
The last two will
receive punishments.

1779
01:01:11,260 --> 01:01:13,160
The punishments are back.

1780
01:01:13,160 --> 01:01:17,030
Before we start, you'll play games
to earn your seed money.

1781
01:01:17,030 --> 01:01:19,070
Let's go to a different location,
and I'll explain the rules to you.

1782
01:01:19,070 --> 01:01:20,200
- Okay.
- Okay.

1783
01:01:20,200 --> 01:01:21,430
(They go somewhere else
to earn seed money.)

1784
01:01:21,760 --> 01:01:24,760
I don't want to doubt other people.

1785
01:01:24,760 --> 01:01:26,760
- I'm innocent.
- I'm already innocent.

1786
01:01:26,760 --> 01:01:28,700
I'm completely innocent.

1787
01:01:28,970 --> 01:01:30,340
There's a love square here.

1788
01:01:30,430 --> 01:01:31,680
What love square?

1789
01:01:31,800 --> 01:01:32,840
You two have some chemistry.

1790
01:01:32,840 --> 01:01:34,010
(Se Chan and So Min have chemistry.)

1791
01:01:34,010 --> 01:01:35,380
Jong Kook and Se Chan have
some chemistry.

1792
01:01:35,380 --> 01:01:36,450
We have some chemistry too.

1793
01:01:37,070 --> 01:01:38,910
- Suk Jin is an island.
- That's one-sided chemistry.

1794
01:01:38,910 --> 01:01:39,950
(Suk Jin is an island.)

1795
01:01:41,160 --> 01:01:42,410
It's one-sided.

1796
01:01:42,410 --> 01:01:44,550
It's a one-sided chemistry.

1797
01:01:44,550 --> 01:01:45,930
One-sided.

1798
01:01:45,950 --> 01:01:47,030
Lone island.

1799
01:01:47,030 --> 01:01:48,430
He's a lone island.

1800
01:01:48,430 --> 01:01:49,550
My gosh.

1801
01:01:49,550 --> 01:01:51,200
He's by himself.

1802
01:01:51,200 --> 01:01:52,220
You guys are ridiculous.

1803
01:01:52,220 --> 01:01:55,090
Why are our cars here too?

1804
01:01:56,340 --> 01:01:58,910
Our cars are all here.

1805
01:01:59,140 --> 01:02:00,430
The license plates are covered too.

1806
01:02:00,430 --> 01:02:01,930
- That's true.
- True.

1807
01:02:01,930 --> 01:02:03,110
(Vehicles are lined up.)

1808
01:02:03,110 --> 01:02:06,050
- Our names are on them.
- Right. Our names are on them.

1809
01:02:06,050 --> 01:02:07,380
Our names are on them.

1810
01:02:07,380 --> 01:02:10,820
Here's the mission to obtain
your individual seed money.

1811
01:02:10,820 --> 01:02:14,050
Ten cars that belong to you all
are lined up behind you.

1812
01:02:14,050 --> 01:02:18,450
You must get in the car
that's not yours.

1813
01:02:18,820 --> 01:02:20,550
You have 10 minutes...

1814
01:02:20,550 --> 01:02:24,390
to either steal something
inside the car or not.

1815
01:02:24,390 --> 01:02:26,030
That's up to you.

1816
01:02:26,860 --> 01:02:27,860
However,

1817
01:02:27,860 --> 01:02:31,570
members with the minority decision
will earn more money.

1818
01:02:31,570 --> 01:02:33,070
Minority decision.

1819
01:02:33,070 --> 01:02:36,380
- This is a mental game.
- This is going to drive me nuts.

1820
01:02:36,380 --> 01:02:38,640
If the side that stole the items
is the minority,

1821
01:02:38,640 --> 01:02:40,840
you will earn five dollars...

1822
01:02:40,840 --> 01:02:42,450
- per item.
- Per item?

1823
01:02:42,450 --> 01:02:43,950
It's better to steal more items.

1824
01:02:43,950 --> 01:02:46,450
Right. If you steal 20 items,
how much do you get?

1825
01:02:47,010 --> 01:02:48,220
- 2 times 5...
- 100 dollars?

1826
01:02:48,220 --> 01:02:49,220
100 dollars.

1827
01:02:49,220 --> 01:02:50,590
It's not 1,000 dollars, Kwang Soo.

1828
01:02:51,450 --> 01:02:52,950
- You asked suddenly.
- It's 100 dollars.

1829
01:02:52,950 --> 01:02:55,130
If the side that didn't steal
anything is the minority,

1830
01:02:55,130 --> 01:02:56,430
each person will get 50 dollars.

1831
01:02:56,430 --> 01:02:58,260
(They will get 50 dollars each.)

1832
01:02:58,260 --> 01:02:59,660
What am I supposed to do?

1833
01:02:59,660 --> 01:03:02,490
The side
that's not part of the minority...

1834
01:03:02,490 --> 01:03:04,570
will get 10 dollars each.

1835
01:03:04,760 --> 01:03:07,430
If you bring multiple same items,
they count as one.

1836
01:03:07,430 --> 01:03:09,530
Dress shoes and sneakers count
as one each,

1837
01:03:09,530 --> 01:03:12,280
but 2 toothbrushes count for 1 only.

1838
01:03:12,280 --> 01:03:15,640
It's not easy to steal things
from Jong Ok's car.

1839
01:03:15,640 --> 01:03:16,910
- Suk Jin too.
- Why?

1840
01:03:16,910 --> 01:03:18,510
You don't know
what you're going to find.

1841
01:03:18,510 --> 01:03:20,840
There'll be nothing to steal
from Suk Jin's car.

1842
01:03:20,840 --> 01:03:23,410
Kwang Soo and So Min...

1843
01:03:23,410 --> 01:03:25,450
- I won't steal.
- 100 percent they will.

1844
01:03:25,450 --> 01:03:26,490
They will steal
regardless of their intentions.

1845
01:03:26,490 --> 01:03:27,490
- They will steal.
- No.

1846
01:03:27,490 --> 01:03:29,450
- It's their instinct.
- They're greedy.

1847
01:03:29,450 --> 01:03:31,390
- Their hands move first.
- It's a habit.

1848
01:03:31,390 --> 01:03:34,090
I'm most curious about Jong Ok.

1849
01:03:34,130 --> 01:03:35,140
- I know.
- Let's watch her.

1850
01:03:35,140 --> 01:03:36,240
I wonder
if she's going to steal or not.

1851
01:03:36,240 --> 01:03:38,470
Maybe she'll return
with her hands full.

1852
01:03:38,470 --> 01:03:41,240
Imagine her walking back
with a tire.

1853
01:03:41,240 --> 01:03:43,240
Or a steering wheel.

1854
01:03:43,240 --> 01:03:44,550
What about you, Hae Sun?

1855
01:03:46,740 --> 01:03:48,220
What about me?

1856
01:03:48,220 --> 01:03:50,740
- Do you usually steal?
- What kind of a question is that?

1857
01:03:50,840 --> 01:03:53,090
She can't tell the truth
if she does.

1858
01:03:53,110 --> 01:03:54,490
I meant...

1859
01:03:54,490 --> 01:03:58,860
You always wear
those life jackets too.

1860
01:04:00,050 --> 01:04:02,490
- Life jackets.
- I want to save you.

1861
01:04:02,490 --> 01:04:05,070
I remember stealing
my friend's eraser when I was young.

1862
01:04:05,070 --> 01:04:06,590
We haven't heard
Hae Sun's response yet.

1863
01:04:06,590 --> 01:04:07,930
- I know.
- Be quiet.

1864
01:04:07,930 --> 01:04:09,470
- Stop it.
- I don't think we'll hear it.

1865
01:04:09,470 --> 01:04:10,490
Stop.

1866
01:04:10,490 --> 01:04:12,140
This is a battlefield.

1867
01:04:12,140 --> 01:04:13,610
How do you think you'll be?

1868
01:04:13,760 --> 01:04:15,840
Thank you for
giving me the opportunity.

1869
01:04:15,840 --> 01:04:16,840
Don't say something like that,
Hae Sun.

1870
01:04:16,840 --> 01:04:19,410
- Is it an award acceptance speech?
- Just talk.

1871
01:04:20,180 --> 01:04:22,640
I think I'll steal.

1872
01:04:23,180 --> 01:04:24,640
- Really?
- That's her style.

1873
01:04:24,640 --> 01:04:25,820
I heard that...

1874
01:04:25,820 --> 01:04:30,450
Jong Ok and Hae Sun have one scene
together in the movie.

1875
01:04:30,450 --> 01:04:31,820
(They have one scene together
in the movie.)

1876
01:04:32,360 --> 01:04:33,430
Scenes where they overlap?

1877
01:04:33,430 --> 01:04:35,660
No wonder they're so awkward
with each other.

1878
01:04:35,860 --> 01:04:37,970
- Only one scene?
- I was watching them,

1879
01:04:37,970 --> 01:04:40,320
- and they didn't look too close.
- They looked awkward.

1880
01:04:40,320 --> 01:04:42,430
We're not close.

1881
01:04:42,430 --> 01:04:44,760
We're mother and daughter
who cut ties with each other.

1882
01:04:44,760 --> 01:04:46,610
- We cut ties.
- They looked cool.

1883
01:04:46,610 --> 01:04:49,070
We predicted correctly.

1884
01:04:49,070 --> 01:04:50,640
- That's true.
- You were right.

1885
01:04:50,640 --> 01:04:53,200
- Right, they're awkward.
- Did you feel it?

1886
01:04:53,200 --> 01:04:55,010
- It was so obvious.
- We were awkward with each other.

1887
01:04:55,010 --> 01:04:56,820
Hae Sun might be...

1888
01:04:56,820 --> 01:04:59,240
more comfortable with me
than Jong Ok right now.

1889
01:04:59,890 --> 01:05:01,450
Why would she feel more comfortable
around you?

1890
01:05:01,450 --> 01:05:03,260
She and I met three times
on different TV shows.

1891
01:05:03,260 --> 01:05:05,320
- Your face is comforting.
- That's right.

1892
01:05:05,320 --> 01:05:06,860
His face is the most comforting.

1893
01:05:06,930 --> 01:05:09,820
I heard a sad story on my way here.

1894
01:05:09,820 --> 01:05:12,320
- What?
- I won't name the TV show.

1895
01:05:12,970 --> 01:05:15,360
The two movies' promotion period
overlapped.

1896
01:05:15,740 --> 01:05:17,660
- So it was Jong Ok and Hae Sun...
- Go on.

1897
01:05:17,660 --> 01:05:18,660
(Jong Ok and Hae Sun's "Innocence")

1898
01:05:18,660 --> 01:05:20,030
versus Ji Hyo and Moo Yul.

1899
01:05:20,640 --> 01:05:23,930
Their movies will be released
at the same time. It's quite sad.

1900
01:05:23,930 --> 01:05:26,050
- You will get teary-eyed.
- Don't laugh.

1901
01:05:26,050 --> 01:05:31,050
Ji Hyo and Moo Yul wanted to promote
their movie on a certain show,

1902
01:05:31,280 --> 01:05:32,390
but they...

1903
01:05:32,390 --> 01:05:34,760
(But they...)

1904
01:05:34,760 --> 01:05:37,490
(got turned down.)

1905
01:05:37,490 --> 01:05:38,820
(Emotional)

1906
01:05:38,820 --> 01:05:41,320
- They got turned down.
- Both movies will be a hit.

1907
01:05:42,030 --> 01:05:43,530
Ji Hyo made one comment.

1908
01:05:43,990 --> 01:05:45,160
"We won't promote our movie."

1909
01:05:45,200 --> 01:05:46,660
("We won't promote our movie.")

1910
01:05:46,700 --> 01:05:48,740
- My goodness.
- TV shows can't help but choose...

1911
01:05:48,740 --> 01:05:52,070
when two movies are released
around the same time.

1912
01:05:52,070 --> 01:05:55,070
- Jong Ok needs this too.
- Both movies will be a hit.

1913
01:05:55,110 --> 01:05:56,840
- Let's go!
- Good luck!

1914
01:05:57,110 --> 01:05:58,840
- Moo Yul, let's work hard.
- Good luck!

1915
01:05:59,070 --> 01:06:03,340
Choi Moo Yul, let's go!

1916
01:06:03,340 --> 01:06:05,180
(Choi Moo Yul, let's go!)

1917
01:06:05,220 --> 01:06:06,450
It's Kim Moo Yul.

1918
01:06:06,450 --> 01:06:08,720
(Ji Hyo chimes in hurriedly.)

1919
01:06:08,820 --> 01:06:10,180
- What?
- Jae Suk.

1920
01:06:10,180 --> 01:06:12,050
- What is wrong with you?
- Jae Suk.

1921
01:06:12,050 --> 01:06:13,890
- It's Kim Moo Yul.
- It's Kim Moo Yul.

1922
01:06:14,160 --> 01:06:15,720
Okay.

1923
01:06:15,950 --> 01:06:17,200
I am sorry, Moo Yul.

1924
01:06:17,360 --> 01:06:18,490
I was only trying to help.

1925
01:06:18,530 --> 01:06:20,970
I hope I didn't hurt your feelings.
I am sorry.

1926
01:06:20,970 --> 01:06:22,700
"Innocence," let's go.
"Intruder," let's go.

1927
01:06:23,070 --> 01:06:25,030
Run to the vehicle
when you hear the whistle.

1928
01:06:25,030 --> 01:06:26,160
Get ready.

1929
01:06:26,300 --> 01:06:28,530
- Let's go.
- I am torn.

1930
01:06:28,880 --> 01:06:31,680
Will more people steal
or leave things as they are?

1931
01:06:31,950 --> 01:06:33,780
I won't go to Suk Jin's vehicle.

1932
01:06:33,780 --> 01:06:35,550
- There are no items.
- In that vehicle,

1933
01:06:35,910 --> 01:06:39,110
- you will only find an e-cigarette.
- That's right.

1934
01:06:39,110 --> 01:06:41,140
(He is a poor man.)

1935
01:06:41,140 --> 01:06:42,450
I won't go to Suk Jin's vehicle.

1936
01:06:43,360 --> 01:06:44,950
Let's begin. Get ready.

1937
01:06:45,820 --> 01:06:47,090
- Set.
- I will go to any car.

1938
01:06:47,090 --> 01:06:48,360
- Suk Jin.
- Yes?

1939
01:06:48,430 --> 01:06:49,890
I didn't say "Go."

1940
01:06:50,320 --> 01:06:51,820
What are you doing?

1941
01:06:51,890 --> 01:06:53,430
I would have arrived last anyway.

1942
01:06:53,660 --> 01:06:55,760
If you hesitate,
only Suk Jin's car will remain.

1943
01:06:55,840 --> 01:06:56,970
Get ready.

1944
01:06:57,070 --> 01:06:58,660
- This is driving me crazy.
- Set.

1945
01:06:58,660 --> 01:07:00,740
(Set, go!)

1946
01:07:00,740 --> 01:07:02,410
(Running)

1947
01:07:03,700 --> 01:07:04,950
- What should I do?
- Jong Ok.

1948
01:07:04,950 --> 01:07:06,280
- No.
- Hold on.

1949
01:07:06,280 --> 01:07:08,450
(Jong Ok enters Haha's car.)

1950
01:07:09,180 --> 01:07:10,610
I should enter Suk Jin's car.

1951
01:07:11,220 --> 01:07:13,450
There is nothing in here.

1952
01:07:13,820 --> 01:07:17,220
I see that he is poor.

1953
01:07:19,320 --> 01:07:20,360
What is this?

1954
01:07:20,530 --> 01:07:21,630
My goodness.

1955
01:07:21,630 --> 01:07:23,430
(Kwang Soo enters Jong Kook's car;
Jae Suk enters Kwang Soo's car.)

1956
01:07:23,430 --> 01:07:25,360
Look at what Kwang Soo has!

1957
01:07:26,160 --> 01:07:27,720
For goodness' sake.

1958
01:07:27,990 --> 01:07:30,800
- Kwang Soo is a nuisance.
- What?

1959
01:07:30,800 --> 01:07:33,140
- Jae Suk, that's...
- What is this?

1960
01:07:34,140 --> 01:07:35,840
(It's a princess mirror.)

1961
01:07:35,840 --> 01:07:37,430
What is this?

1962
01:07:37,430 --> 01:07:38,550
It's such a big mirror.

1963
01:07:38,680 --> 01:07:41,050
Why doesn't he carry around
a smaller mirror?

1964
01:07:41,950 --> 01:07:43,550
Why did Kwang Soo leave
his wallet in here?

1965
01:07:45,090 --> 01:07:46,510
Gosh, Kwang Soo...

1966
01:07:47,240 --> 01:07:48,610
He has 23 dollars in his wallet.

1967
01:07:49,110 --> 01:07:51,430
(He has a lot of self-love
and not much money.)

1968
01:07:51,930 --> 01:07:53,390
There are so many things
in this car.

1969
01:07:54,220 --> 01:07:55,800
I should steal 10 things...

1970
01:07:57,030 --> 01:07:58,200
at the very least.

1971
01:07:58,200 --> 01:08:01,430
(Kwang Soo decides to become
a big-time thief.)

1972
01:08:01,430 --> 01:08:03,760
Even if I am not the minority,
I should do my best.

1973
01:08:03,760 --> 01:08:05,760
(Jong Kook's car)

1974
01:08:05,760 --> 01:08:08,930
(He is emptying the car.)

1975
01:08:09,740 --> 01:08:11,280
I feel like a real thief.

1976
01:08:12,200 --> 01:08:13,380
This is a bankbook.

1977
01:08:13,800 --> 01:08:18,220
- Your fly is open.
- What?

1978
01:08:20,950 --> 01:08:22,760
(Stealing diligently
made his pants become unzipped.)

1979
01:08:22,760 --> 01:08:23,780
I am sorry.

1980
01:08:24,610 --> 01:08:25,760
Viewers,

1981
01:08:26,430 --> 01:08:29,430
it's a secret that my fly was open.

1982
01:08:31,150 --> 01:08:33,600
I feel bad about
going through an actress's bag.

1983
01:08:33,860 --> 01:08:35,990
She is reading a book.

1984
01:08:35,990 --> 01:08:37,160
(He finds a book!)

1985
01:08:37,160 --> 01:08:38,840
"The Long, Long Life of Trees."

1986
01:08:38,840 --> 01:08:42,340
(The title is
"The Long, Long Life of Trees.")

1987
01:08:42,340 --> 01:08:43,900
(He isn't interested in the book.)

1988
01:08:43,900 --> 01:08:46,270
(Suk Jin only reads it briefly.)

1989
01:08:46,380 --> 01:08:48,410
I should take one.

1990
01:08:48,910 --> 01:08:50,380
Did I put in the whole thing?

1991
01:08:50,570 --> 01:08:52,940
(The newbie of variety shows
is figuring things out.)

1992
01:08:52,940 --> 01:08:54,110
He is stealing.

1993
01:08:54,110 --> 01:08:55,190
(Se Chan's car)

1994
01:08:55,190 --> 01:08:56,780
(I need to be the minority.)

1995
01:08:56,780 --> 01:08:58,520
I'm not going to steal.

1996
01:08:58,650 --> 01:08:59,650
I am sorry.

1997
01:09:00,190 --> 01:09:01,230
(Haha's car)

1998
01:09:01,820 --> 01:09:03,130
I will get bread.

1999
01:09:03,130 --> 01:09:04,400
(Jong Ok steals bread
from Haha's car.)

2000
01:09:04,400 --> 01:09:06,600
(She looks around for more items.)

2001
01:09:06,600 --> 01:09:08,190
So you are done.

2002
01:09:09,300 --> 01:09:11,470
There is nothing more to steal.

2003
01:09:12,160 --> 01:09:14,510
Isn't this a hand sanitizer?

2004
01:09:14,770 --> 01:09:16,070
It's a hand sanitizer.

2005
01:09:19,100 --> 01:09:20,270
I will steal it.

2006
01:09:20,940 --> 01:09:23,770
Hand sanitizers
are hard to come by these days.

2007
01:09:23,770 --> 01:09:25,050
(Jong Ok steals everyday items.)

2008
01:09:25,690 --> 01:09:27,910
(Happy)

2009
01:09:27,910 --> 01:09:29,310
Who was Haha?

2010
01:09:30,520 --> 01:09:31,590
Haha.

2011
01:09:31,590 --> 01:09:34,020
(After stealing, she asks,
"Who was Haha?")

2012
01:09:34,190 --> 01:09:36,300
- Haha is...
- Is he the one in a hat?

2013
01:09:36,730 --> 01:09:38,820
- The one who was at the very end.
- The right end.

2014
01:09:38,820 --> 01:09:40,820
That's right.
I got confused for a second.

2015
01:09:40,820 --> 01:09:42,470
(I remember now.)

2016
01:09:42,530 --> 01:09:44,560
How many items is he stealing?

2017
01:09:45,510 --> 01:09:46,730
Kwang Soo.

2018
01:09:46,730 --> 01:09:49,010
(Kwang Soo became a big-time thief.)

2019
01:09:49,810 --> 01:09:52,940
(It looks like
he wants to set Guinness record.)

2020
01:09:52,940 --> 01:09:55,110
(Jong Kook's car)

2021
01:09:55,110 --> 01:09:58,070
(He's stealing a lot of items.)

2022
01:10:00,520 --> 01:10:02,390
(He gets an extra vest as well.)

2023
01:10:02,390 --> 01:10:03,390
Five,

2024
01:10:03,910 --> 01:10:06,430
(Times comes to an end.)

2025
01:10:06,430 --> 01:10:09,150
(The old thief returns hurriedly.)

2026
01:10:09,150 --> 01:10:10,320
One.

2027
01:10:10,730 --> 01:10:12,820
- Time's up.
- Where is everyone?

2028
01:10:13,820 --> 01:10:14,900
Now,

2029
01:10:15,360 --> 01:10:17,660
stop and come on out.

2030
01:10:17,770 --> 01:10:19,060
Everyone stole items.

2031
01:10:19,230 --> 01:10:22,010
This is bad.
We can't be the minority.

2032
01:10:22,070 --> 01:10:24,940
- Everyone stole items.
- I had no choice.

2033
01:10:25,570 --> 01:10:27,400
There are too many thieves.

2034
01:10:27,400 --> 01:10:29,850
We aren't the minority.
Everyone stole things.

2035
01:10:31,850 --> 01:10:32,910
This is unbelievable.

2036
01:10:32,910 --> 01:10:35,650
- I shouldn't have stolen things.
- I shouldn't have stolen things.

2037
01:10:35,650 --> 01:10:38,110
- I have a question for Jong Kook.
- Okay.

2038
01:10:38,320 --> 01:10:39,760
Do you apply eyeliner every day?

2039
01:10:39,760 --> 01:10:42,100
(It's a shocking revelation.)

2040
01:10:43,020 --> 01:10:45,190
(He found an eyeliner
in Jong Kook's car.)

2041
01:10:45,230 --> 01:10:47,020
- I found an eyeliner...
- Hey.

2042
01:10:47,020 --> 01:10:48,440
on your seat.

2043
01:10:48,440 --> 01:10:49,840
What is this about?

2044
01:10:49,840 --> 01:10:51,030
Jong Kook, close your eyes.

2045
01:10:51,030 --> 01:10:53,060
Why would I apply eyeliner?
Whose is it?

2046
01:10:53,060 --> 01:10:55,140
- Whose is it?
- You want your eyes to look bigger.

2047
01:10:55,140 --> 01:10:56,230
- No!
- It was on your seat.

2048
01:10:56,730 --> 01:10:58,270
- He applies eyeliner.
- It must be Gap Jin's.

2049
01:10:58,270 --> 01:11:00,180
- Gap Jin must apply eyeliner.
- Let me see your eyes.

2050
01:11:00,180 --> 01:11:02,650
- What is this?
- He isn't wearing eyeliner.

2051
01:11:02,650 --> 01:11:04,270
I don't wear makeup.

2052
01:11:04,270 --> 01:11:05,480
- It's an eyeliner.
- An eyeliner.

2053
01:11:05,480 --> 01:11:06,810
- I don't wear makeup.
- Kwang Soo.

2054
01:11:07,220 --> 01:11:08,850
I put 50 dollars in your wallet.

2055
01:11:11,020 --> 01:11:14,350
(Kwang Soo, you should have
50 dollars in your wallet.)

2056
01:11:14,350 --> 01:11:15,600
Jae Suk, why would you say that?

2057
01:11:15,800 --> 01:11:17,490
- You...
- It's not like that.

2058
01:11:18,020 --> 01:11:20,230
- You only had 23 dollars.
- I ran out of cash.

2059
01:11:20,490 --> 01:11:21,990
You should carry around some cash.

2060
01:11:21,990 --> 01:11:23,690
I put 50 dollars in your wallet.

2061
01:11:23,690 --> 01:11:25,970
- You should have that much.
- Thank you, Jae Suk.

2062
01:11:26,470 --> 01:11:30,030
Jong Ok has
a lot of health food in her car.

2063
01:11:30,570 --> 01:11:32,100
(Staring)

2064
01:11:32,100 --> 01:11:33,200
Jong Ok, is that your bag?

2065
01:11:33,850 --> 01:11:35,980
- No, no.
- Isn't this her bag?

2066
01:11:35,980 --> 01:11:37,380
- No.
- It's...

2067
01:11:37,770 --> 01:11:39,190
(It's not a designer bag.)

2068
01:11:39,190 --> 01:11:42,910
(It's a back cushion.)

2069
01:11:43,650 --> 01:11:45,590
(It looks like a designer bag.)

2070
01:11:45,590 --> 01:11:47,320
- I thought it was a bag.
- It looks like one.

2071
01:11:47,320 --> 01:11:49,060
It isn't a bag.

2072
01:11:49,060 --> 01:11:51,320
- You thought it was a designer bag.
- Yes, I did.

2073
01:11:51,320 --> 01:11:54,730
I was like,
"Why did Suk Jin steal her bag?"

2074
01:11:54,820 --> 01:11:56,690
It thought it was a designer bag.

2075
01:11:56,840 --> 01:11:58,140
Let me tell you about
Suk Jin's car.

2076
01:11:58,140 --> 01:11:59,360
(Jong Kook reveals something
in Suk Jin's car.)

2077
01:11:59,360 --> 01:12:01,440
By the driver's seat,

2078
01:12:01,440 --> 01:12:04,100
he has a cute photo of himself.

2079
01:12:04,380 --> 01:12:07,100
By the passenger seat,

2080
01:12:07,200 --> 01:12:08,940
- he has a photo of So Min.
- What?

2081
01:12:08,940 --> 01:12:11,780
(It's very shocking.)

2082
01:12:13,050 --> 01:12:15,260
- Really?
- Stop joking.

2083
01:12:15,260 --> 01:12:17,020
- A photo of me?
- I am dead serious.

2084
01:12:17,260 --> 01:12:18,450
- Is he crazy?
- In Suk Jin's car?

2085
01:12:18,450 --> 01:12:20,190
- I am dead serious. Go and check.
- Stop joking.

2086
01:12:20,280 --> 01:12:21,480
- Why?
- I mean...

2087
01:12:21,480 --> 01:12:23,850
- Are you serious?
- I am serious.

2088
01:12:24,320 --> 01:12:26,190
- Is he crazy?
- Do you really like So Min?

2089
01:12:26,190 --> 01:12:28,160
I had no idea. Stop joking.

2090
01:12:28,160 --> 01:12:30,230
I am not joking!
There is a photo of So Min!

2091
01:12:30,230 --> 01:12:31,560
- Really?
- Go and check.

2092
01:12:31,560 --> 01:12:33,700
- Go and check.
- He must be out of his mind.

2093
01:12:33,700 --> 01:12:35,270
- Go and check.
- Really?

2094
01:12:35,270 --> 01:12:37,640
- He must be out of his mind.
- That's just wrong.

2095
01:12:37,640 --> 01:12:39,050
- Go and check.
- Are you serious?

2096
01:12:39,380 --> 01:12:40,850
- Suk Jin, do you really like me?
- What are you going to do?

2097
01:12:41,810 --> 01:12:43,570
- It's true! I see So Min's photo!
- Where?

2098
01:12:43,570 --> 01:12:45,220
- It's here.
- I was telling the truth.

2099
01:12:45,550 --> 01:12:47,350
- It's true! I see So Min's photo!
- Where?

2100
01:12:47,350 --> 01:12:49,060
- It's here.
- I was telling the truth.

2101
01:12:49,060 --> 01:12:52,590
(So Min's photo)

2102
01:12:53,850 --> 01:12:56,690
(There are Suk Jin's photo
and So Min's photo...)

2103
01:12:56,690 --> 01:12:59,400
(at the driver's seat
and passenger's seat.)

2104
01:13:00,520 --> 01:13:01,770
Who put it there?

2105
01:13:01,900 --> 01:13:03,440
- Who pulled this prank on me?
- He must be out of his mind.

2106
01:13:03,440 --> 01:13:04,530
It's not a prank!

2107
01:13:04,530 --> 01:13:06,530
- I saw it when I entered.
- Is this for real?

2108
01:13:06,730 --> 01:13:09,310
- What is this? Can they air this?
- He must be out of his mind.

2109
01:13:09,310 --> 01:13:11,400
It's no wonder
he gets so jealous of Se Chan.

2110
01:13:11,510 --> 01:13:14,150
He always picks on Se Chan.

2111
01:13:14,480 --> 01:13:16,770
I told you, So Min.

2112
01:13:17,110 --> 01:13:19,810
- You pulled this prank, right?
- Why would I do that?

2113
01:13:19,980 --> 01:13:21,980
I don't like this either.
Why would I do that?

2114
01:13:21,980 --> 01:13:23,450
I don't even sit there.

2115
01:13:23,450 --> 01:13:25,060
I always sit
behind the passenger's seat.

2116
01:13:25,060 --> 01:13:27,150
- I never look at the compartment.
- He looks from afar.

2117
01:13:27,150 --> 01:13:28,690
- I had never seen it before.
- He looks from afar.

2118
01:13:28,690 --> 01:13:30,020
- He looks from afar.
- Hey.

2119
01:13:30,150 --> 01:13:31,730
Why am I so popular?

2120
01:13:31,930 --> 01:13:32,990
Also,

2121
01:13:32,990 --> 01:13:34,190
did you buy...

2122
01:13:34,230 --> 01:13:36,230
- a women's bag recently?
- Why would I do that?

2123
01:13:36,490 --> 01:13:38,060
- What?
- Is there a women's bag?

2124
01:13:38,060 --> 01:13:40,560
There is a receipt
for a women's designer bag.

2125
01:13:40,560 --> 01:13:41,730
This is no joke.

2126
01:13:41,730 --> 01:13:43,730
- Watch what you say!
- What is going on?

2127
01:13:44,600 --> 01:13:47,850
(Did Suk Jin buy
a women's designer bag?)

2128
01:13:47,850 --> 01:13:49,180
- Watch what you say!
- What is going on?

2129
01:13:49,380 --> 01:13:51,610
- Watch what you say!
- I am serious!

2130
01:13:51,680 --> 01:13:53,390
- Stop joking.
- What?

2131
01:13:53,390 --> 01:13:54,650
Stay right there.

2132
01:13:54,810 --> 01:13:56,890
Suk Jin must be out of his mind.

2133
01:13:57,090 --> 01:13:58,350
- What is going on?
- Listen.

2134
01:13:58,350 --> 01:14:00,430
I don't use that car!

2135
01:14:00,430 --> 01:14:02,820
- I just ride it for work.
- What kind of life is he living?

2136
01:14:03,230 --> 01:14:04,560
It's not my car, okay?

2137
01:14:04,560 --> 01:14:06,160
- This is driving me crazy.
- Who pulled this prank?

2138
01:14:06,160 --> 01:14:07,270
- Suk Jin.
- What?

2139
01:14:07,270 --> 01:14:09,340
"The luxury goods section
of a department store."

2140
01:14:09,900 --> 01:14:11,560
- "A women's bag."
- My goodness.

2141
01:14:11,560 --> 01:14:13,230
(A receipt for a women's bag
was found at Suk Jin's car.)

2142
01:14:13,360 --> 01:14:15,180
- It's expensive too.
- I never bought it.

2143
01:14:15,180 --> 01:14:17,230
- Hold on.
- See whose card was used!

2144
01:14:17,230 --> 01:14:18,570
See whose card was used!

2145
01:14:18,570 --> 01:14:20,150
- I mean...
- This is for real.

2146
01:14:20,150 --> 01:14:21,350
It wasn't my card.

2147
01:14:21,400 --> 01:14:22,980
If you are having an affair,
come clean right now.

2148
01:14:23,050 --> 01:14:25,070
Suk Jin must be out of his mind.

2149
01:14:25,150 --> 01:14:26,350
Then why do you have this
in your car?

2150
01:14:26,720 --> 01:14:27,980
Are you saying
your manager bought it?

2151
01:14:27,980 --> 01:14:29,690
I am sure he did. Give it to me.

2152
01:14:29,690 --> 01:14:30,850
- Suk Jin.
- Suk Jin's wife!

2153
01:14:31,450 --> 01:14:33,430
I am sure his wife received it.

2154
01:14:34,130 --> 01:14:35,630
You did, right?

2155
01:14:35,690 --> 01:14:37,850
- This is insane.
- Suk Jin is in a lot of trouble.

2156
01:14:37,850 --> 01:14:39,160
I have a question.

2157
01:14:39,160 --> 01:14:40,860
I have never seen
this powder before.

2158
01:14:40,860 --> 01:14:42,530
- Tumeric?
- What is that?

2159
01:14:42,530 --> 01:14:44,160
- It's a root vegetable.
- A root vegetable?

2160
01:14:44,160 --> 01:14:47,440
Suk Jin! Trying to change
the subject won't work.

2161
01:14:47,440 --> 01:14:50,940
Give us an explanation about
the bag and So Min's photo.

2162
01:14:50,940 --> 01:14:52,810
(Jae Suk asks for an explanation.)

2163
01:14:52,810 --> 01:14:55,220
- This is driving me crazy.
- Who cares about tumeric?

2164
01:14:55,220 --> 01:14:56,440
I am innocent.

2165
01:14:56,440 --> 01:14:58,690
So Min, why did you put
your photo there?

2166
01:14:58,850 --> 01:15:00,610
I remember So Min with that handbag.

2167
01:15:00,610 --> 01:15:01,910
No way.

2168
01:15:01,910 --> 01:15:03,310
(Shaking)

2169
01:15:04,110 --> 01:15:06,520
- This can't be!
- I don't have that handbag.

2170
01:15:06,520 --> 01:15:08,090
- No!
- No!

2171
01:15:08,090 --> 01:15:11,560
I swear I just found out
her picture was there.

2172
01:15:11,560 --> 01:15:12,630
- I don't have the bag.
- I swear.

2173
01:15:12,630 --> 01:15:14,490
I don't have that handbag.

2174
01:15:14,490 --> 01:15:16,660
I don't even want to think about it,
so don't even mention it!

2175
01:15:16,660 --> 01:15:18,060
- Hold on.
- I knew.

2176
01:15:18,060 --> 01:15:19,640
- I didn't do it.
- What were you doing?

2177
01:15:19,640 --> 01:15:21,010
I know my manager did it.

2178
01:15:21,010 --> 01:15:23,140
Why are you rude to Se Chan
these days?

2179
01:15:24,270 --> 01:15:26,440
- He hit my joint this morning.
- I know.

2180
01:15:26,440 --> 01:15:27,810
I didn't hit you, you punk.

2181
01:15:27,810 --> 01:15:29,050
(He is kind of rough.)

2182
01:15:29,050 --> 01:15:32,810
Suk Jin looked at me and said,
"You lost a lot of weight."

2183
01:15:32,850 --> 01:15:35,110
"Why did you lose so much weight?"

2184
01:15:35,110 --> 01:15:39,320
(He tried to sound cute
and used his nasal voice.)

2185
01:15:39,320 --> 01:15:40,430
Really?

2186
01:15:40,430 --> 01:15:41,590
(He can't deny this.)

2187
01:15:41,590 --> 01:15:43,130
- This is insane.
- Cut it out.

2188
01:15:43,130 --> 01:15:45,990
This is
how the truth gets distorted.

2189
01:15:45,990 --> 01:15:47,490
- That was a confession.
- You heard him.

2190
01:15:47,490 --> 01:15:50,690
I heard him,
so I asked why he was saying that.

2191
01:15:50,690 --> 01:15:52,360
- I know.
- It was annoying.

2192
01:15:52,470 --> 01:15:54,140
I'm entirely innocent.

2193
01:15:54,400 --> 01:15:56,070
My wife...

2194
01:15:56,200 --> 01:15:58,100
knows the truth.

2195
01:15:58,100 --> 01:15:59,400
- She knows everything.
- Fine.

2196
01:15:59,400 --> 01:16:01,910
If it's the truth, say it.
We can edit it out.

2197
01:16:01,910 --> 01:16:03,770
Don't edit it out.
I have nothing to hide.

2198
01:16:03,770 --> 01:16:04,910
- The handbag...
- My picture...

2199
01:16:05,550 --> 01:16:07,610
What about the handbag?
Don't edit it out.

2200
01:16:07,610 --> 01:16:08,950
He says that now,

2201
01:16:09,090 --> 01:16:11,020
and he'll go to Chul Min later
and say, "Edit it out."

2202
01:16:11,020 --> 01:16:12,730
(Chul Min is the main producer.)

2203
01:16:13,730 --> 01:16:15,600
We'll watch this episode
in two weeks,

2204
01:16:15,600 --> 01:16:17,350
and if this is not on it,
you called.

2205
01:16:17,350 --> 01:16:18,430
You can include this.

2206
01:16:18,430 --> 01:16:20,160
- We're going to watch this.
- She has nothing to do with me.

2207
01:16:20,160 --> 01:16:22,530
"Mr. Noh, I'm in trouble."

2208
01:16:22,530 --> 01:16:24,360
(The CEO of Suk Jin's agency)

2209
01:16:24,360 --> 01:16:26,810
(He'll ask for help from his CEO.)

2210
01:16:26,810 --> 01:16:28,140
He'll clean up everything.

2211
01:16:28,980 --> 01:16:30,010
"Not this."

2212
01:16:30,010 --> 01:16:31,340
(It concludes
as a mere coincidence.)

2213
01:16:31,340 --> 01:16:32,570
This is driving me nuts.

2214
01:16:32,680 --> 01:16:33,810
Who was in my car?

2215
01:16:33,940 --> 01:16:35,050
- Me.
- Were you?

2216
01:16:35,050 --> 01:16:37,220
- What did you take?
- I took what I needed.

2217
01:16:37,220 --> 01:16:38,980
- Like what?
- Hand sanitizers are...

2218
01:16:38,980 --> 01:16:40,940
expensive these days.

2219
01:16:40,940 --> 01:16:42,090
He had this.

2220
01:16:42,090 --> 01:16:44,060
- You don't get to take it.
- She actually stole it.

2221
01:16:44,220 --> 01:16:45,630
She actually stole it.

2222
01:16:45,630 --> 01:16:47,390
- You don't get to keep it.
- Why did you steal it?

2223
01:16:47,390 --> 01:16:49,820
- I thought I could take it.
- No, Jong Ok.

2224
01:16:49,820 --> 01:16:52,400
You'll get arrested for it.

2225
01:16:52,400 --> 01:16:53,970
We have to return these.

2226
01:16:53,970 --> 01:16:55,990
- She took some bread too.
- Where's the bread from?

2227
01:16:55,990 --> 01:16:58,300
There was bread,
so I was going to eat some.

2228
01:16:58,440 --> 01:17:00,700
- You can have it.
- Have some.

2229
01:17:00,700 --> 01:17:01,840
You can have it.

2230
01:17:01,840 --> 01:17:04,310
If we can't take this,
let's use this throughout the day.

2231
01:17:04,310 --> 01:17:06,380
- Use it.
- I'm sorry,

2232
01:17:06,380 --> 01:17:09,770
but can we check your pockets
before you leave?

2233
01:17:09,770 --> 01:17:11,650
(She has a bad habit.)

2234
01:17:11,650 --> 01:17:13,410
She actually stole it.

2235
01:17:13,410 --> 01:17:15,980
I thought
we could actually take this.

2236
01:17:15,980 --> 01:17:18,760
- We can use it.
- She's so simple.

2237
01:17:18,820 --> 01:17:19,980
Go ahead.

2238
01:17:19,980 --> 01:17:23,130
- What did you take, Ji Hyo?
- I was inside Hae Sun's car.

2239
01:17:23,130 --> 01:17:24,560
You have a lot of things.

2240
01:17:24,560 --> 01:17:26,630
- My car is really dirty.
- She had so many things.

2241
01:17:26,630 --> 01:17:28,230
Did you steal her handbag?

2242
01:17:28,230 --> 01:17:29,340
Hae Sun's...

2243
01:17:29,340 --> 01:17:31,140
- Socks?
- She had one sock.

2244
01:17:31,140 --> 01:17:32,770
- It's not mine.
- Where is the other one?

2245
01:17:32,770 --> 01:17:33,810
It's not mine.

2246
01:17:34,770 --> 01:17:35,810
This.

2247
01:17:35,810 --> 01:17:37,340
- It's her stylist's.
- What's that?

2248
01:17:37,340 --> 01:17:38,680
- Really?
- It's not mine.

2249
01:17:38,680 --> 01:17:40,700
My bad.

2250
01:17:41,350 --> 01:17:43,070
Why did you bring her stylist's bag?

2251
01:17:43,070 --> 01:17:46,110
This bag is filled with things
that can't be aired on TV.

2252
01:17:46,780 --> 01:17:48,240
I also have a question.

2253
01:17:48,910 --> 01:17:50,190
- Why do you have a screwdriver?
- Why was that there?

2254
01:17:50,190 --> 01:17:51,310
I don't know.

2255
01:17:51,310 --> 01:17:52,980
Only professional car thieves
carry that.

2256
01:17:52,980 --> 01:17:55,430
- She's going to rob a place.
- Only car thieves carry that.

2257
01:17:55,430 --> 01:17:56,430
I know.

2258
01:17:56,430 --> 01:17:58,300
When car doors don't open,

2259
01:17:58,300 --> 01:18:00,470
- you can use this.
- Right.

2260
01:18:00,630 --> 01:18:02,360
Professional car thieves carry it.

2261
01:18:02,600 --> 01:18:04,440
- I've never seen these items.
- It's straight.

2262
01:18:04,440 --> 01:18:05,510
This too.

2263
01:18:05,510 --> 01:18:06,560
- You spray it up your nose.
- This too.

2264
01:18:07,200 --> 01:18:08,600
- You spray it up your nose.
- You spray it up your nose.

2265
01:18:09,680 --> 01:18:11,270
- That's embarrassing.
- She has rhinitis.

2266
01:18:11,600 --> 01:18:12,940
- You spray it up your nose.
- Rhinitis.

2267
01:18:12,940 --> 01:18:13,980
How do you use this?

2268
01:18:13,980 --> 01:18:16,050
- Do you do this?
- Yes.

2269
01:18:16,050 --> 01:18:17,740
(That's a bad demonstration.)

2270
01:18:17,740 --> 01:18:19,480
(Like this.)

2271
01:18:19,480 --> 01:18:21,190
- Is that what you do?
- I'm curious.

2272
01:18:21,190 --> 01:18:22,950
Hae Sun was slightly mad.

2273
01:18:23,110 --> 01:18:25,390
- She was glaring at me.
- She was.

2274
01:18:25,390 --> 01:18:27,780
- "Yes. Like this."
- My bad.

2275
01:18:27,780 --> 01:18:29,450
(Keep my rhinitis a secret.)

2276
01:18:29,450 --> 01:18:30,560
She was mad.

2277
01:18:30,560 --> 01:18:32,230
I have so many things in my pocket.

2278
01:18:32,230 --> 01:18:33,320
What do you have?

2279
01:18:33,320 --> 01:18:35,560
I stole your socks and tights.

2280
01:18:35,560 --> 01:18:37,140
I don't have tights.
I don't wear them.

2281
01:18:37,140 --> 01:18:38,530
Whose tights are these?

2282
01:18:38,530 --> 01:18:39,940
(He's flustered.)

2283
01:18:39,940 --> 01:18:42,270
- My stylist's.
- This.

2284
01:18:42,270 --> 01:18:44,270
Why did you take her stylist's?

2285
01:18:44,270 --> 01:18:45,880
It's not mine.

2286
01:18:45,880 --> 01:18:47,310
- My bad.
- Gosh.

2287
01:18:47,310 --> 01:18:49,150
- Why did you take the tights?
- That's what I saw.

2288
01:18:49,150 --> 01:18:51,720
It's weird for you
to steal my tights.

2289
01:18:51,720 --> 01:18:55,350
- I took what I saw.
- You should steal my heart, punk.

2290
01:18:55,350 --> 01:18:57,950
(Steal my heart, not the tights.)

2291
01:18:58,060 --> 01:18:59,780
(You can be the thief of my heart.)

2292
01:18:59,780 --> 01:19:00,980
Steal her heart, punk.

2293
01:19:00,980 --> 01:19:02,900
- Steal her heart.
- "You should steal my heart, punk."

2294
01:19:02,900 --> 01:19:04,230
(Se Chan is the thief
of So Min's heart.)

2295
01:19:04,230 --> 01:19:05,260
Which car were you in, So Min?

2296
01:19:05,260 --> 01:19:06,470
Ji Hyo's.

2297
01:19:06,970 --> 01:19:08,660
Her car had nothing.

2298
01:19:08,660 --> 01:19:11,470
Nothing. Her slippers and car keys.

2299
01:19:11,470 --> 01:19:12,770
There was something else though.

2300
01:19:12,770 --> 01:19:13,840
What?

2301
01:19:14,840 --> 01:19:17,100
(What is it?)

2302
01:19:18,030 --> 01:19:21,070
- There was a lighter.
- What?

2303
01:19:21,070 --> 01:19:22,070
Hey!

2304
01:19:22,550 --> 01:19:24,220
This is real, so please blur it out.

2305
01:19:24,220 --> 01:19:27,520
- That is not mine!
- It might burst.

2306
01:19:27,520 --> 01:19:28,690
(That is not mine!)

2307
01:19:28,690 --> 01:19:30,950
I told you not to smoke in the car,
you punk!

2308
01:19:30,950 --> 01:19:33,190
- It might burst.
- It has her name on it.

2309
01:19:33,190 --> 01:19:34,280
(He frames her.)

2310
01:19:34,280 --> 01:19:35,520
It's her stylist's.

2311
01:19:35,520 --> 01:19:37,430
- I told you not to do it!
- Ji Hyo.

2312
01:19:37,520 --> 01:19:39,690
- I'm sorry.
- Look at this too.

2313
01:19:39,690 --> 01:19:42,360
Look at how many toothbrushes
she has.

2314
01:19:42,360 --> 01:19:43,640
Quiet.

2315
01:19:43,640 --> 01:19:44,970
- Quiet.
- Quiet.

2316
01:19:45,660 --> 01:19:47,010
(Gosh...)

2317
01:19:47,010 --> 01:19:48,510
Jong Ok,
can I borrow the hand sanitizer?

2318
01:19:48,510 --> 01:19:49,530
(Hand sanitizer from Haha's car)

2319
01:19:50,030 --> 01:19:51,530
- You need some?
- Great.

2320
01:19:51,770 --> 01:19:53,100
I hope you're healthy.

2321
01:19:53,570 --> 01:19:54,810
I hope you're healthy.

2322
01:19:54,810 --> 01:19:56,020
(Ji Hyo, be healthy.)

2323
01:19:56,020 --> 01:19:57,810
Haha, whose car were you in?

2324
01:19:57,810 --> 01:20:00,810
I have so many.

2325
01:20:00,810 --> 01:20:02,910
- What did you take?
- Is it Jae Suk's?

2326
01:20:02,910 --> 01:20:04,690
This first.

2327
01:20:04,690 --> 01:20:06,060
He studies the game of Go.

2328
01:20:06,060 --> 01:20:08,150
- Really?
- He studies Go in the morning.

2329
01:20:08,150 --> 01:20:10,430
- He's a typical old fossil.
- Old fossil.

2330
01:20:10,430 --> 01:20:12,100
- A typical old fossil.
- True old fossil.

2331
01:20:12,190 --> 01:20:13,520
What an old fossil.

2332
01:20:14,300 --> 01:20:15,990
Apgujeong Super Oldie.

2333
01:20:16,600 --> 01:20:18,140
(Yoo Jae Suk,
Apgujeong Super Oldie)

2334
01:20:18,140 --> 01:20:19,200
He had a lot of these too.

2335
01:20:19,200 --> 01:20:20,700
Yu San Seul.

2336
01:20:20,810 --> 01:20:22,340
- CD?
- Yu San Seul.

2337
01:20:22,340 --> 01:20:23,840
I really wanted this.

2338
01:20:23,840 --> 01:20:25,600
- You really like it.
- I really want it.

2339
01:20:25,600 --> 01:20:30,570
There were also many untitled DVDs,
but I didn't take those.

2340
01:20:30,570 --> 01:20:31,650
(He frames Jae Suk.)

2341
01:20:31,650 --> 01:20:33,350
(There were DVD's
with adult content...)

2342
01:20:33,350 --> 01:20:34,350
(stacked in Jae Suk's car.)

2343
01:20:34,350 --> 01:20:35,890
Stop being ridiculous!

2344
01:20:36,590 --> 01:20:38,090
He still has that habit.

2345
01:20:38,090 --> 01:20:40,450
There was a large TV inside.

2346
01:20:40,450 --> 01:20:41,730
You're insane.

2347
01:20:41,730 --> 01:20:42,760
I saw those,

2348
01:20:42,850 --> 01:20:45,150
- but I didn't take them.
- Stop being ridiculous.

2349
01:20:45,190 --> 01:20:48,160
- Does he still watch the DVD?
- Do you still watch it?

2350
01:20:48,270 --> 01:20:49,770
I don't watch it.

2351
01:20:49,770 --> 01:20:51,770
- I don't watch it.
- It's on USBs now.

2352
01:20:51,770 --> 01:20:54,200
It's compact now.
Are you innocent?

2353
01:20:54,200 --> 01:20:55,600
- Do you watch it off a USB?
- How do you know?

2354
01:20:55,600 --> 01:20:57,100
You watch it off a USB.
What else is there?

2355
01:20:57,100 --> 01:20:58,600
- Do you watch it on a USB?
- Movies.

2356
01:20:58,600 --> 01:21:00,380
- Why are you making a confession?
- A USB?

2357
01:21:00,380 --> 01:21:02,050
- What was that?
- Do you watch it?

2358
01:21:02,050 --> 01:21:04,440
- Movies.
- It's 2020.

2359
01:21:04,650 --> 01:21:06,720
- What are you saying?
- Movies.

2360
01:21:06,720 --> 01:21:09,110
- How many can you fit in it?
- Movies.

2361
01:21:09,190 --> 01:21:10,560
What did you bring?

2362
01:21:10,690 --> 01:21:11,950
Jong Kook's...

2363
01:21:12,020 --> 01:21:14,150
There's nothing inside your car.
I took everything.

2364
01:21:14,150 --> 01:21:15,950
Hey. What did you take?

2365
01:21:15,950 --> 01:21:17,100
Well,

2366
01:21:17,100 --> 01:21:18,520
- I wanted more money.
- He took Gap Jin's things too.

2367
01:21:18,520 --> 01:21:21,230
- He took everything.
- He took Gap Jin's things too.

2368
01:21:21,230 --> 01:21:22,690
- What's in your belly?
- What's that?

2369
01:21:23,160 --> 01:21:24,970
It's his instinct.

2370
01:21:24,970 --> 01:21:27,100
- Kwang Soo, don't be like this.
- What is it?

2371
01:21:27,200 --> 01:21:30,310
- What is it?
- He stole a lot of things.

2372
01:21:30,380 --> 01:21:31,440
I'm sorry, Jong Kook.

2373
01:21:31,640 --> 01:21:33,310
(Spilling)

2374
01:21:33,310 --> 01:21:34,380
Well...

2375
01:21:34,400 --> 01:21:35,680
Goodness.

2376
01:21:35,680 --> 01:21:36,680
(That's just from his belly.)

2377
01:21:36,680 --> 01:21:38,570
- My gosh.
- Why do you do this?

2378
01:21:38,570 --> 01:21:41,050
- Because everything counts.
- Seriously.

2379
01:21:41,050 --> 01:21:42,350
He stole everything.

2380
01:21:43,350 --> 01:21:44,590
- A bracelet too.
- It'll be a hassle.

2381
01:21:44,590 --> 01:21:45,820
That rascal.

2382
01:21:45,820 --> 01:21:47,980
- When will you clean all this up?
- When will you clean it up?

2383
01:21:47,980 --> 01:21:49,990
You have to clean this up.

2384
01:21:49,990 --> 01:21:52,020
- It's endless.
- How did you take all those?

2385
01:21:52,020 --> 01:21:53,900
He's so tiring.

2386
01:21:53,900 --> 01:21:55,690
- My gosh.
- He's so tiring to have around.

2387
01:21:55,690 --> 01:21:56,990
Put these back now.

2388
01:21:58,230 --> 01:21:59,840
- Clean these up.
- Put them back.

2389
01:22:00,140 --> 01:22:02,100
Put them back. What did you do?

2390
01:22:02,100 --> 01:22:03,900
You robbed his car.

2391
01:22:03,900 --> 01:22:06,380
So the minority group goes
to those who didn't steal.

2392
01:22:06,380 --> 01:22:08,740
Hae Sun and Jong Kook get
50 dollars each.

2393
01:22:08,740 --> 01:22:10,770
(Hae Sun and Jong Kook didn't steal
anything, so they get 50 each.)

2394
01:22:10,770 --> 01:22:13,520
Thank you.

2395
01:22:13,610 --> 01:22:16,520
I considered not stealing as well.

2396
01:22:16,590 --> 01:22:18,060
Right, that's for us.

2397
01:22:18,220 --> 01:22:20,130
- We only get 10 dollars.
- I shouldn't have stolen anything.

2398
01:22:20,130 --> 01:22:21,450
They still give us 10 dollars.

2399
01:22:21,450 --> 01:22:23,150
You obtained your seed money,

2400
01:22:23,230 --> 01:22:25,860
so we have to decide the teams.
The two guests are the captains.

2401
01:22:25,860 --> 01:22:27,060
Do rock-paper-scissors...

2402
01:22:27,060 --> 01:22:28,820
- All right.
- and the winner picks.

2403
01:22:30,270 --> 01:22:33,270
(Team Jong Ok, Team Hae Sun)

2404
01:22:33,270 --> 01:22:35,700
So Min will be uncomfortable
on this team.

2405
01:22:35,700 --> 01:22:36,980
Why?

2406
01:22:37,070 --> 01:22:39,510
- Because of you.
- You're wrong!

2407
01:22:39,510 --> 01:22:40,700
Will you be okay?

2408
01:22:40,700 --> 01:22:42,310
Give him back the designer bag.

2409
01:22:42,310 --> 01:22:44,050
(The foolish love story
doesn't die down.)

2410
01:22:44,520 --> 01:22:45,720
(Good luck, Suk Jin!)

2411
01:22:46,050 --> 01:22:48,310
(And it isn't over yet.)

2412
01:22:48,650 --> 01:22:50,780
(Meanwhile,
he has to lie down alone,)

2413
01:22:50,780 --> 01:22:52,780
(and he can't hold back
his laughter.)

2414
01:22:52,780 --> 01:22:54,020
Good job!

2415
01:22:54,020 --> 01:22:57,450
(In order to win, you must hide
your movements and expressions.)

2416
01:22:58,320 --> 01:23:00,130
(However,)

2417
01:23:00,130 --> 01:23:02,690
(a guilty person is found.)

2418
01:23:02,860 --> 01:23:04,990
(In order to protect their
seed money,)

2419
01:23:04,990 --> 01:23:06,970
(they must trick
and lie to each other.)

2420
01:23:08,510 --> 01:23:11,530
(Until your lies become a reality)

2421
01:23:11,880 --> 01:23:14,740
(We'll trick everybody
until the end.)

2422
01:23:15,650 --> 01:23:16,980
(Decide! Bag, Part Two)
