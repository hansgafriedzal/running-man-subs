1
00:00:45,590 --> 00:00:46,880
What is this?

2
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:50,110
- They are bowling pins.
- It's bowling.

3
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:54,420
(What's the first game they are
playing with bowling pins?)

4
00:00:55,390 --> 00:00:56,750
It's bowling.

5
00:00:57,200 --> 00:00:59,590
I'm good at bowling.
My score is 100.

6
00:00:59,590 --> 00:01:00,990
Aren't you just a fool?

7
00:01:02,690 --> 00:01:04,640
What? That means you are...

8
00:01:04,740 --> 00:01:05,940
chonggak kimchi?

9
00:01:07,010 --> 00:01:08,940
It sounds just about right.

10
00:01:08,940 --> 00:01:10,240
I know. It sounds right.

11
00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:12,800
This is the first mission
for the team match.

12
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:15,170
It's Human Bowling: Sticky Guys.

13
00:01:16,170 --> 00:01:18,620
A player from each team
will take turns.

14
00:01:18,620 --> 00:01:21,550
A player will roll
to the bowling pins...

15
00:01:21,550 --> 00:01:24,980
wearing a sleep shade
within one minute.

16
00:01:24,980 --> 00:01:28,190
But the surface of
the bowling set is very sticky.

17
00:01:28,190 --> 00:01:32,300
If you end up on the sticky part
at the end of the time limit,

18
00:01:32,300 --> 00:01:35,130
you will stay put
at where you are stuck.

19
00:01:35,190 --> 00:01:38,470
If you're outside the sticker,
you will be eliminated.

20
00:01:38,510 --> 00:01:42,110
Then the next player will
take part in the mission.

21
00:01:42,110 --> 00:01:46,900
The team that knocks down
the most pins will win.

22
00:01:47,010 --> 00:01:50,380
We'll put on a sleep shade
and roll forward?

23
00:01:50,380 --> 00:01:51,380
Exactly.

24
00:01:51,380 --> 00:01:52,910
But you can't go out of the lines.

25
00:01:52,910 --> 00:01:55,990
If you roll to the side,
you will be eliminated.

26
00:01:55,990 --> 00:01:57,710
Can I roll over and over again?

27
00:01:57,710 --> 00:01:59,350
You are given one minute.

28
00:01:59,350 --> 00:02:01,660
We should hurry. It will take
a long time to get there.

29
00:02:01,660 --> 00:02:02,990
I'm in trouble.
I can't roll forward.

30
00:02:02,990 --> 00:02:04,900
You keep rolling aside.

31
00:02:04,900 --> 00:02:08,660
Anyway, I'd like you to decide
which team will go first.

32
00:02:08,660 --> 00:02:10,900
Jae Suk, shall we
play Race of Wits?

33
00:02:10,900 --> 00:02:12,460
Let's play Race of Wits.

34
00:02:12,460 --> 00:02:13,710
- Race of Wits?
- Do you know Race of Wits?

35
00:02:13,710 --> 00:02:14,710
Okay.

36
00:02:14,710 --> 00:02:15,830
- Let's begin.
- One.

37
00:02:15,830 --> 00:02:17,210
- We should sit down.
- Is it wrong?

38
00:02:17,210 --> 00:02:19,440
- Did I do it wrong?
- Hae Sun, what are you doing?

39
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:21,680
- What should I do?
- Say one as you sit down.

40
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:23,120
- Ready...
- One.

41
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:24,380
(Ready...)

42
00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:27,210
(She makes a false start
feeling highly motivated.)

43
00:02:27,210 --> 00:02:29,320
You should wait until I say start.

44
00:02:29,320 --> 00:02:32,520
(While Hae Sun feels motivated...)

45
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:34,660
(What? I don't know how to play.)

46
00:02:34,660 --> 00:02:36,820
(Jong Ok gets coached
on how to play.)

47
00:02:36,820 --> 00:02:38,100
Ready...

48
00:02:38,100 --> 00:02:40,160
Even if you don't know the game,
you should go along with it.

49
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:42,040
Jong Ok, you can just stand still.

50
00:02:42,370 --> 00:02:43,690
- Someone will lose anyway.
- I'll just wait standing still.

51
00:02:43,690 --> 00:02:46,070
All right. Ready, set, go.

52
00:02:46,430 --> 00:02:47,710
- 1.
- 1. Gosh.

53
00:02:49,100 --> 00:02:50,830
(A bad example
of excessive ambition)

54
00:02:50,830 --> 00:02:52,800
- So the two of us are out.
- You two are out.

55
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:54,750
Again. Ready, set, go.

56
00:02:54,750 --> 00:02:55,750
One.

57
00:02:56,440 --> 00:02:57,480
Two.

58
00:02:57,940 --> 00:02:59,940
- 3.
- 4.

59
00:02:59,940 --> 00:03:01,090
- 5.
- 5.

60
00:03:01,290 --> 00:03:03,060
(Shouting 5 loudly)

61
00:03:03,690 --> 00:03:05,420
Go again with the two of us out.

62
00:03:06,590 --> 00:03:07,790
One of us loses every time.

63
00:03:07,790 --> 00:03:09,630
Ready, set, go.

64
00:03:09,630 --> 00:03:11,820
- 1.
- 2.

65
00:03:11,820 --> 00:03:13,190
(She remembers the advice
from her colleague.)

66
00:03:13,190 --> 00:03:14,290
- 3.
- 4.

67
00:03:14,290 --> 00:03:15,690
- 4.
- 5.

68
00:03:15,690 --> 00:03:16,840
Jong Ok.

69
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:18,360
(Don't I win if I stay standing?)

70
00:03:18,630 --> 00:03:19,700
- 1.
- 2.

71
00:03:19,730 --> 00:03:22,730
(She just stood still until the end
as Suk Jin advised.)

72
00:03:23,480 --> 00:03:26,310
- Nice!
- Okay!

73
00:03:26,310 --> 00:03:27,310
- You go first.
- She's a big senior.

74
00:03:27,310 --> 00:03:28,540
Oh no.

75
00:03:28,540 --> 00:03:30,480
- She's cute.
- She was like this at the end.

76
00:03:31,380 --> 00:03:33,690
You told me to stand still.

77
00:03:33,690 --> 00:03:35,320
Suk Jin did.

78
00:03:35,320 --> 00:03:37,260
- I'm sorry.
- You should've told her to sit.

79
00:03:37,260 --> 00:03:39,660
I trusted him.

80
00:03:39,660 --> 00:03:42,000
- All right. Suk Jin, you go first.
- Why should I go first?

81
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,060
- All right.
- Our team goes first.

82
00:03:43,060 --> 00:03:44,660
Show us how it's done.

83
00:03:44,730 --> 00:03:45,730
- Suk Jin.
- Okay.

84
00:03:45,730 --> 00:03:46,920
You are very important.

85
00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:49,940
You saw that, right? You shouldn't
touch the sticky part.

86
00:03:49,940 --> 00:03:51,440
- Let's go.
- I should roll straight.

87
00:03:51,470 --> 00:03:53,540
Ready, set, go.

88
00:03:55,570 --> 00:03:57,100
(Surprised)

89
00:03:57,100 --> 00:03:58,640
He's really good.

90
00:03:58,640 --> 00:03:59,910
(He's really good.)

91
00:03:59,910 --> 00:04:02,070
(He rolls straight forward
without veering off.)

92
00:04:05,220 --> 00:04:06,220
(He uses his arm
to help himself navigate.)

93
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:07,820
How did he know that?

94
00:04:08,220 --> 00:04:09,950
- He has a good sense of direction.
- Is there a time limit?

95
00:04:09,950 --> 00:04:11,010
It's one minute.

96
00:04:11,010 --> 00:04:12,980
- My gosh.
- You should do it in one minute.

97
00:04:12,980 --> 00:04:14,190
That's amazing.

98
00:04:14,190 --> 00:04:15,630
(The arm compass is
shaking a little.)

99
00:04:16,730 --> 00:04:17,730
(He sits on the sticky part.)

100
00:04:17,730 --> 00:04:19,290
You have to do it in one minute.

101
00:04:19,290 --> 00:04:20,290
(He's stuck.)

102
00:04:20,290 --> 00:04:22,500
Oh no. What now?

103
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:25,570
(What should we do about him?)

104
00:04:25,570 --> 00:04:26,600
This is...

105
00:04:26,910 --> 00:04:29,480
He wears red thermal
underwear like that.

106
00:04:29,670 --> 00:04:31,010
Is he doing that on purpose?

107
00:04:31,010 --> 00:04:32,910
(Sticky)

108
00:04:32,910 --> 00:04:34,010
(The gloves are stuck too.)

109
00:04:34,910 --> 00:04:36,380
He's like a fly.

110
00:04:36,380 --> 00:04:38,380
He lost his gloves and socks.

111
00:04:38,380 --> 00:04:39,720
(He flounders with the spirit
of non-possession.)

112
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:41,440
He's like a fly.

113
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:43,910
(He looks like a fly on flypaper.)

114
00:04:43,910 --> 00:04:45,590
He's like a fly on flypaper.

115
00:04:45,590 --> 00:04:46,690
(He looks like a fly on flypaper.)

116
00:04:46,690 --> 00:04:48,060
(A fly with a big nose)

117
00:04:48,790 --> 00:04:50,290
(They laugh...)

118
00:04:50,290 --> 00:04:51,290
(and cry at the same time.)

119
00:04:51,290 --> 00:04:52,790
Hae Sun finds it really funny.

120
00:04:52,790 --> 00:04:54,600
Suk Jin might
take off all his clothes.

121
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:56,000
(He's still struggling.)

122
00:04:57,690 --> 00:04:59,310
(The more they watch him,)

123
00:04:59,310 --> 00:05:02,410
(the worse they feel for the fly.)

124
00:05:02,410 --> 00:05:03,410
(Time's up.)

125
00:05:03,410 --> 00:05:05,670
- Oh no. I feel really bad.
- He should stay like that.

126
00:05:05,670 --> 00:05:07,210
He's not listening.

127
00:05:07,210 --> 00:05:08,610
- Stay.
- Stay. Stop it.

128
00:05:08,610 --> 00:05:09,950
You should stop.

129
00:05:10,910 --> 00:05:11,910
Oh no.

130
00:05:11,910 --> 00:05:14,590
You should stay there.
You may take off the sleep shade.

131
00:05:14,590 --> 00:05:16,720
Can't you even do this?

132
00:05:16,890 --> 00:05:18,680
- You should give it a try.
- You shouldn't move.

133
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:21,420
- Stay still.
- You should stay there.

134
00:05:21,420 --> 00:05:23,990
(He should stay on the sticker
until the game ends.)

135
00:05:24,490 --> 00:05:26,290
My goodness.
Should he stay there like that?

136
00:05:26,290 --> 00:05:28,100
Take off the sleep shade.
It's okay to take it off.

137
00:05:28,100 --> 00:05:31,430
You should think.
You can't move like that.

138
00:05:31,430 --> 00:05:33,160
Hey, you give it a try.

139
00:05:34,100 --> 00:05:35,160
Do you think it's easy?

140
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:37,980
You should either make it funny
or hit the pins.

141
00:05:38,580 --> 00:05:39,740
It was so boring.

142
00:05:39,740 --> 00:05:41,910
- You should pick one.
- You made it look so boring.

143
00:05:41,910 --> 00:05:43,740
I'll wait and see how good you are.

144
00:05:43,740 --> 00:05:45,610
The yellow team will go next as is.

145
00:05:45,610 --> 00:05:46,680
Team Hae Sun.

146
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:48,660
- It's better to go first.
- But he's right there.

147
00:05:48,660 --> 00:05:49,890
We have to keep trying like this?

148
00:05:49,890 --> 00:05:51,680
It's good
that you closed off the path.

149
00:05:52,420 --> 00:05:54,590
- Really? I did a good job.
- Right.

150
00:05:54,790 --> 00:05:56,600
Suk Jin, you should stay still.

151
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:58,700
- What did you say?
- You should stay still.

152
00:05:58,700 --> 00:06:01,200
There's nothing else I can do.

153
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:02,560
(He's cute.)

154
00:06:03,640 --> 00:06:07,040
When Jong Ok laughs,
she sounds like a character...

155
00:06:07,060 --> 00:06:08,800
from an animated movie.

156
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:09,800
What?

157
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:11,080
(Laughing)

158
00:06:11,080 --> 00:06:12,710
It's her real laugh.

159
00:06:12,710 --> 00:06:14,650
(Jong Ok's 2D laughter)

160
00:06:14,650 --> 00:06:16,110
She laughs exactly like "Ha-ha."

161
00:06:16,110 --> 00:06:17,610
She keeps calling my name.

162
00:06:17,670 --> 00:06:18,740
Who's next?

163
00:06:18,740 --> 00:06:20,110
- Kwang Soo, do you want to try?
- Okay.

164
00:06:20,180 --> 00:06:22,220
- Kwang Soo.
- You should block the way.

165
00:06:22,220 --> 00:06:23,790
Kwang Soo, go block the way.

166
00:06:23,790 --> 00:06:25,420
Kwang Soo is very tall.

167
00:06:25,420 --> 00:06:27,420
- I will make it long.
- Good.

168
00:06:27,550 --> 00:06:30,030
I wouldn't have gone first if I knew
I'd stay here like this.

169
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:31,830
No, you did a good job.

170
00:06:31,830 --> 00:06:33,900
Did I? I love you, Jong Ok.

171
00:06:34,660 --> 00:06:36,640
(What did you say?)

172
00:06:36,640 --> 00:06:38,730
Did I? I love you, Jong Ok.

173
00:06:38,730 --> 00:06:40,500
- Good luck.
- All of a sudden?

174
00:06:40,930 --> 00:06:43,500
- He sounds like a romanticist.
- He's a romanticist.

175
00:06:43,910 --> 00:06:46,300
(He rarely says that to his wife.)

176
00:06:46,300 --> 00:06:48,740
He rarely says that to his wife.

177
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:50,810
- What?
- That's why I hate him.

178
00:06:50,810 --> 00:06:52,520
That's too brutal.

179
00:06:52,520 --> 00:06:54,720
- It's a fatal blow.
- But I had to say it.

180
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:56,160
I just know what he's like.

181
00:06:56,520 --> 00:06:58,590
- Kwang Soo, do it right.
- Okay.

182
00:06:58,590 --> 00:07:01,390
You sound like you are
older than Kwang Soo.

183
00:07:01,790 --> 00:07:03,700
- Oh, really?
- Be careful.

184
00:07:03,700 --> 00:07:05,990
It's strange
that I don't feel offended.

185
00:07:05,990 --> 00:07:08,930
Meanwhile, Hae Sun looks
like an audience.

186
00:07:08,930 --> 00:07:10,430
This is fun.

187
00:07:10,930 --> 00:07:12,430
I'm glad to hear that.

188
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:16,000
This isn't something you can
experience in your daily life.

189
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,280
- Right.
- That's true.

190
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:20,000
Even celebrities don't
have a chance to do this...

191
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,650
unless they appear on variety shows.

192
00:07:21,650 --> 00:07:23,610
I don't even know where I can
get these tight suits from.

193
00:07:23,610 --> 00:07:24,670
I know.

194
00:07:26,950 --> 00:07:28,020
It's so funny.

195
00:07:28,220 --> 00:07:30,680
- Ready...
- He's very feisty.

196
00:07:30,680 --> 00:07:32,090
He's in trouble.

197
00:07:32,090 --> 00:07:35,230
He looks like the longest tentacle
of a dried squid.

198
00:07:36,250 --> 00:07:38,050
The longest tentacle
of a dried squid.

199
00:07:38,050 --> 00:07:39,700
You can buy it
at a department store.

200
00:07:39,700 --> 00:07:41,600
Ready, set, go.

201
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:43,400
(He starts with his long leg.)

202
00:07:43,660 --> 00:07:44,840
Good.

203
00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:47,160
Good. He's doing good
because he's tall.

204
00:07:47,930 --> 00:07:49,580
(Speeding up)

205
00:07:49,580 --> 00:07:50,800
(Flipping down)

206
00:07:51,230 --> 00:07:53,080
He's doing good
because he's tall.

207
00:07:53,080 --> 00:07:54,540
(Welcome to the sticky world.)

208
00:07:55,540 --> 00:07:56,870
Gosh, look at that.

209
00:07:57,310 --> 00:07:58,410
(Giggling)

210
00:07:58,410 --> 00:08:00,410
- He's stuck.
- That's good.

211
00:08:00,410 --> 00:08:02,480
- This is good.
- It looks so funny.

212
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:04,160
Oh no.

213
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:05,590
Good.

214
00:08:05,590 --> 00:08:06,790
You have only one minute.

215
00:08:06,790 --> 00:08:08,290
(He's like a chick
hatching from its egg.)

216
00:08:08,290 --> 00:08:10,900
- Is it that hard to go straight?
- It looks so hard.

217
00:08:10,900 --> 00:08:12,290
Can't you go straight?

218
00:08:12,290 --> 00:08:13,600
- Good.
- There you go.

219
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:15,860
- That's good.
- Well done.

220
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:17,560
You got one minute.

221
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:19,300
(The time is coming to an end.)

222
00:08:19,300 --> 00:08:20,470
(Struggling)

223
00:08:20,470 --> 00:08:21,730
Where is he going?

224
00:08:22,300 --> 00:08:24,410
- Oh no.
- Oh no.

225
00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:26,450
(Laughing)

226
00:08:26,450 --> 00:08:28,980
- I guess it's extremely sticky.
- It's really sticky.

227
00:08:29,540 --> 00:08:30,720
Take off the sleep shade.

228
00:08:31,310 --> 00:08:33,020
- Take it off.
- Oh no.

229
00:08:33,020 --> 00:08:34,350
(Is that it?)

230
00:08:34,350 --> 00:08:35,520
I should've rolled one more time.

231
00:08:35,850 --> 00:08:37,960
Gosh, it's really sticky.

232
00:08:38,020 --> 00:08:39,530
This isn't easy.

233
00:08:39,620 --> 00:08:43,200
Let me show you how it's done.

234
00:08:43,730 --> 00:08:44,850
He's stepping up.

235
00:08:44,920 --> 00:08:46,660
- Jae Suk is stepping up.
- We should help you.

236
00:08:46,790 --> 00:08:49,360
This is all about experience.

237
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:51,230
- There's the 3, 7 guy.
- 3, 7 guy?

238
00:08:51,230 --> 00:08:52,640
- Jae Suk, 3.
- Strawberry...

239
00:08:52,930 --> 00:08:54,600
- Jae Suk, seven.
- My gosh.

240
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:57,140
- Yoo Jae Suk.
- The 3, 7 guy.

241
00:08:57,210 --> 00:08:59,740
Jong Ok and Hae Sun, watch me.

242
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:01,450
Watch me carefully.

243
00:09:01,740 --> 00:09:03,240
Jae Suk, just make sure
not to put us to shame.

244
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:04,850
Watch me, Jong Kook.

245
00:09:04,950 --> 00:09:06,520
For this,

246
00:09:06,650 --> 00:09:08,680
I should roll myself up.

247
00:09:08,680 --> 00:09:10,550
- Okay.
- And I shouldn't move a lot.

248
00:09:10,750 --> 00:09:12,420
You will see how bad he is.

249
00:09:12,420 --> 00:09:14,050
(On his honor as an entertainer)

250
00:09:14,050 --> 00:09:15,160
(Excited)

251
00:09:15,160 --> 00:09:16,230
Ready, set...

252
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:19,860
We're doomed.

253
00:09:19,860 --> 00:09:22,570
(He charges toward the sticker
as soon as the whistle is blown.)

254
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:24,890
(He's done for already.)

255
00:09:24,990 --> 00:09:26,310
Look at his head.

256
00:09:27,230 --> 00:09:29,100
(Groaning)

257
00:09:29,100 --> 00:09:30,180
Oh no.

258
00:09:30,180 --> 00:09:31,940
(He's stuck with a single cry.)

259
00:09:31,940 --> 00:09:33,740
- He's stuck.
- Jae Suk, three.

260
00:09:34,550 --> 00:09:35,640
Jae Suk, seven.

261
00:09:35,720 --> 00:09:37,450
- Jae Suk.
- Hey!

262
00:09:37,450 --> 00:09:40,010
- What are you doing?
<i>- Strawberry, st-raw-berry</i>

263
00:09:40,420 --> 00:09:42,750
- What is this...
- What are you doing there?

264
00:09:42,920 --> 00:09:44,980
(He's trying
to overcome the sticky slump.)

265
00:09:48,380 --> 00:09:49,890
You don't need pants now.

266
00:09:50,700 --> 00:09:52,020
That's right. Take them off.

267
00:09:52,020 --> 00:09:53,390
Take off your socks.

268
00:09:53,390 --> 00:09:55,570
(He takes off his pants
and charges forward.)

269
00:09:55,890 --> 00:09:58,300
It looks like a metamorphosis
of a pupa.

270
00:09:58,300 --> 00:09:59,730
Why are you taking off your pants?

271
00:09:59,730 --> 00:10:01,860
(Goodbye, my pants. I should go.)

272
00:10:01,970 --> 00:10:03,100
That's good.

273
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:04,980
That's right.

274
00:10:05,740 --> 00:10:07,350
Take off your shirt. My gosh.

275
00:10:08,870 --> 00:10:11,950
(The time is up
while he rolls forward.)

276
00:10:13,010 --> 00:10:15,050
(It's so funny.)

277
00:10:15,050 --> 00:10:16,380
It's gross.

278
00:10:16,780 --> 00:10:17,880
Don't you dare move.

279
00:10:19,590 --> 00:10:21,560
- Stay still.
- Stay still.

280
00:10:21,560 --> 00:10:22,750
I can't move.

281
00:10:22,750 --> 00:10:24,430
You went the wrong way
from the beginning.

282
00:10:24,430 --> 00:10:26,020
Why are you spreading your legs?

283
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:27,800
(Spread wide)

284
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:28,860
Why...

285
00:10:29,070 --> 00:10:31,230
It's so funny. What should we do?

286
00:10:31,300 --> 00:10:32,970
It looks really ugly from here.

287
00:10:32,970 --> 00:10:35,000
Why are you spreading
your legs in front of the camera?

288
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,180
My posture is...

289
00:10:36,180 --> 00:10:37,440
(As he gets a lot of criticism,)

290
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:39,740
(they put a tray on him.)

291
00:10:40,350 --> 00:10:41,550
What are you doing...

292
00:10:41,870 --> 00:10:43,370
What's that?

293
00:10:43,370 --> 00:10:44,510
(It's taken care of.)

294
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:46,450
Hey.

295
00:10:46,550 --> 00:10:48,510
What are you doing?

296
00:10:50,060 --> 00:10:51,720
Hey, what do you think
you're doing now?

297
00:10:51,780 --> 00:10:52,880
(He's highly satisfied.)

298
00:10:53,730 --> 00:10:55,560
- Who's next?
- My goodness.

299
00:10:55,560 --> 00:10:57,390
I will get there like a bulldozer.

300
00:10:57,390 --> 00:10:58,850
I'm worried about him.

301
00:10:58,850 --> 00:11:00,300
You should overcome the sticker.

302
00:11:00,390 --> 00:11:02,360
Hey, my face is here.

303
00:11:02,360 --> 00:11:03,890
My face is in the middle of it.

304
00:11:03,890 --> 00:11:04,970
I'll just go through it.

305
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:06,730
You should be careful.

306
00:11:06,970 --> 00:11:08,980
Ready, set...

307
00:11:09,340 --> 00:11:11,180
(Start)

308
00:11:12,210 --> 00:11:13,680
- Here I go.
- How is possible?

309
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:15,080
He's going straight.

310
00:11:15,820 --> 00:11:16,870
Is it even possible?

311
00:11:16,870 --> 00:11:18,270
(He rolls forward in the right
direction with tireless momentum.)

312
00:11:18,270 --> 00:11:19,320
Is it even possible?

313
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:20,350
(Stop coming.)

314
00:11:20,780 --> 00:11:22,320
Gosh, he's going straight.

315
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:23,420
(He does look like a bulldozer.)

316
00:11:24,590 --> 00:11:27,090
(And the sticker No. 1
meets with the bulldozer.)

317
00:11:28,090 --> 00:11:29,230
Stop him.

318
00:11:29,230 --> 00:11:32,730
(Will it be blocked or penetrated?)

319
00:11:32,730 --> 00:11:34,170
(He defeats Suk Jin immediately.)

320
00:11:34,760 --> 00:11:35,760
Stop him.

321
00:11:36,130 --> 00:11:39,130
(Jong Kook has reached
the bowling pins.)

322
00:11:39,130 --> 00:11:43,080
(Is he hitting a strike like that?)

323
00:11:43,900 --> 00:11:46,050
(He hits only 1 pin.)

324
00:11:46,500 --> 00:11:47,550
No.

325
00:11:47,740 --> 00:11:49,950
(He gets eliminated
after hitting only 1 pin.)

326
00:11:49,950 --> 00:11:51,140
What was that?

327
00:11:51,320 --> 00:11:52,850
It was going really well.

328
00:11:53,550 --> 00:11:55,450
- What's that?
- It was so close.

329
00:11:55,450 --> 00:11:56,460
What was that?

330
00:11:56,650 --> 00:11:59,650
- Jong Kook suddenly turned left.
- Since you're not on the sticker,

331
00:11:59,650 --> 00:12:00,830
you can come out of it.

332
00:12:01,730 --> 00:12:02,960
I was in a rush
at the last moment.

333
00:12:03,020 --> 00:12:05,100
It's become less sticky now,

334
00:12:05,100 --> 00:12:06,700
so we will cut down
the time to 30 seconds.

335
00:12:06,830 --> 00:12:08,430
So Min will go next.

336
00:12:08,430 --> 00:12:09,600
(Team Jong Ok's next player
is Jeon So Min.)

337
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:10,700
Let me try.

338
00:12:10,890 --> 00:12:12,760
You should hit 1 pin, So Min.
Only 2 pins.

339
00:12:12,900 --> 00:12:15,030
I can't roll forward to begin with.

340
00:12:15,100 --> 00:12:17,730
Just do it.

341
00:12:18,900 --> 00:12:20,980
Gosh, what's Jae Suk doing?

342
00:12:21,740 --> 00:12:25,370
- My goodness.
- Why are you being like that?

343
00:12:25,370 --> 00:12:27,380
- It's embarrassing.
- My gosh.

344
00:12:28,980 --> 00:12:30,820
Aren't you going to get rid of this?

345
00:12:33,190 --> 00:12:34,980
Ready, set...

346
00:12:35,590 --> 00:12:37,150
(Start)

347
00:12:37,650 --> 00:12:39,430
- So Min, just do it.
- It's all about speed.

348
00:12:40,230 --> 00:12:41,360
Don't go that way.

349
00:12:42,070 --> 00:12:44,100
Gosh, where are you going?

350
00:12:44,100 --> 00:12:46,030
- Hey, where are you going?
- I'm here.

351
00:12:46,030 --> 00:12:48,760
- Good.
- Good. You're doing it well.

352
00:12:48,760 --> 00:12:50,180
- My gosh.
- Keep rolling.

353
00:12:51,500 --> 00:12:54,050
- I think she's almost there.
- Good.

354
00:12:54,740 --> 00:12:56,180
Good.

355
00:12:56,770 --> 00:12:58,050
Good.

356
00:12:58,050 --> 00:12:59,450
(Making a deep bow)

357
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:04,250
(After making a bow,
she heads to the pins again.)

358
00:13:04,250 --> 00:13:05,960
- Keep rolling.
- Looking good.

359
00:13:06,350 --> 00:13:07,620
Good.

360
00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:08,830
(My goodness)

361
00:13:08,830 --> 00:13:09,890
That's good.

362
00:13:09,890 --> 00:13:11,850
Oh no. That was close.

363
00:13:11,850 --> 00:13:13,360
Gosh, what's this?

364
00:13:13,930 --> 00:13:15,940
- She was going well.
- What is this?

365
00:13:16,530 --> 00:13:18,360
- What are you doing here?
- I got you at the last moment.

366
00:13:18,530 --> 00:13:19,760
This is...

367
00:13:20,210 --> 00:13:21,340
- 30 seconds?
- I get only 30 seconds?

368
00:13:22,170 --> 00:13:23,870
- Who should go next?
- I'll go next.

369
00:13:23,940 --> 00:13:26,580
(Ji Hyo of Team Hae Sun
is going next.)

370
00:13:26,580 --> 00:13:28,450
All you need to do is go straight.

371
00:13:28,450 --> 00:13:30,720
I just saw what they did.
I'm scared.

372
00:13:31,240 --> 00:13:32,740
Ji Hyo is good.

373
00:13:33,380 --> 00:13:35,640
You should go between
Suk Jin and So Min.

374
00:13:35,640 --> 00:13:37,720
- Okay. I will try.
- So Min, make sure to block her.

375
00:13:38,690 --> 00:13:40,250
They have good defense.

376
00:13:40,250 --> 00:13:41,650
What should we do about him?

377
00:13:42,330 --> 00:13:43,330
(Me?)

378
00:13:43,330 --> 00:13:44,520
(He can't believe
what's happening to him.)

379
00:13:44,650 --> 00:13:46,570
I can cover your face with the sleep
shade if you feel embarrassed.

380
00:13:47,260 --> 00:13:48,970
- Hey.
- Do you want to cover your face?

381
00:13:48,970 --> 00:13:51,970
My gosh.
Do you have a death wish?

382
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:54,340
Let's begin. Ready, set...

383
00:13:55,980 --> 00:13:57,840
(Ji Hyo starts.)

384
00:13:58,440 --> 00:14:00,450
- What's she doing?
- She's the ace player.

385
00:14:01,210 --> 00:14:03,420
(She's got the instinct
of the ace player.)

386
00:14:05,110 --> 00:14:06,280
Good.

387
00:14:06,280 --> 00:14:07,450
(I have to stop her.)

388
00:14:10,280 --> 00:14:11,920
(Groaning)

389
00:14:13,980 --> 00:14:14,980
(She breaks through Suk Jin.)

390
00:14:14,980 --> 00:14:16,020
Keep going.

391
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:17,750
(This is a good chance.)

392
00:14:17,750 --> 00:14:19,760
Ji Hyo, good.
You're going the right way.

393
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:22,230
- No.
- Hey!

394
00:14:22,840 --> 00:14:23,940
Let me go!

395
00:14:23,940 --> 00:14:26,210
(Ji Hyo punishes her.)

396
00:14:26,900 --> 00:14:28,100
(What is going on?)

397
00:14:28,100 --> 00:14:29,370
Let go of me.

398
00:14:30,210 --> 00:14:31,400
Ji Hyo.

399
00:14:31,870 --> 00:14:34,770
- Get off me.
- Keep rolling.

400
00:14:34,980 --> 00:14:37,080
No, not that way.

401
00:14:37,080 --> 00:14:39,780
(She totally missed the pins.)

402
00:14:40,140 --> 00:14:41,450
(Laughing)

403
00:14:41,450 --> 00:14:42,560
This is amazing.

404
00:14:43,190 --> 00:14:45,220
Where am I? Hey!

405
00:14:45,780 --> 00:14:47,620
- Who was that?
- It was so close.

406
00:14:47,850 --> 00:14:49,990
Ji Hyo poked me in the butt.

407
00:14:49,990 --> 00:14:51,750
Good defense.

408
00:14:51,750 --> 00:14:53,800
She was going straight.

409
00:14:54,230 --> 00:14:57,200
- She was almost there.
- I lost my direction...

410
00:14:57,630 --> 00:14:58,940
- trying to avoid them.
- Jae Suk.

411
00:14:59,100 --> 00:15:00,500
You should watch this on TV.

412
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:04,730
- It was fun.
- Let's just get this over with.

413
00:15:06,370 --> 00:15:08,710
Jae Suk. Jae Suk is
having a lonely battle.

414
00:15:08,850 --> 00:15:09,980
The 3, 7 guy.

415
00:15:11,110 --> 00:15:14,110
Why am I feeling so lonely
on TV shows these days?

416
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:17,960
I feel lonely
in TV shows these days.

417
00:15:19,350 --> 00:15:21,690
- Is Jong Ok going next?
- Jong Ok.

418
00:15:21,690 --> 00:15:24,250
You should roll straight.
So Min and I will move over.

419
00:15:24,250 --> 00:15:25,830
- Good luck.
- We'll get out of the way.

420
00:15:25,830 --> 00:15:26,930
I can defend.

421
00:15:26,930 --> 00:15:29,200
I should block Kwang Soo.

422
00:15:29,260 --> 00:15:30,570
Ready, set...

423
00:15:31,970 --> 00:15:34,000
(Jong Ok starts rolling forward.)

424
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:36,310
- My gosh.
- Good.

425
00:15:37,100 --> 00:15:38,270
(Jong Ok can't avoid...)

426
00:15:38,270 --> 00:15:39,600
Jong Ok, gosh.

427
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:40,900
(the sticky swamp.)

428
00:15:40,900 --> 00:15:43,770
- Jong Ok, gosh.
- Jong Ok. You should...

429
00:15:44,220 --> 00:15:45,350
Jong Ok.

430
00:15:45,420 --> 00:15:46,510
Wait.

431
00:15:46,590 --> 00:15:47,820
- Jong Ok.
- Jong Ok.

432
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:49,050
Jong Ok!

433
00:15:49,220 --> 00:15:50,250
That's good.

434
00:15:50,380 --> 00:15:51,590
Jong Ok, you're good.

435
00:15:51,720 --> 00:15:53,980
Jong Ok, it's good. Very good.

436
00:15:53,980 --> 00:15:55,020
Move over.

437
00:15:55,380 --> 00:15:58,200
(Team Jong Ok is
blocking the way now.)

438
00:15:58,200 --> 00:15:59,490
Good. We should move over.

439
00:15:59,490 --> 00:16:00,670
(The gate of Suk Jin is open.)

440
00:16:01,070 --> 00:16:02,260
Good. We should move over.

441
00:16:02,260 --> 00:16:03,390
- Good.
- Stop her.

442
00:16:03,390 --> 00:16:04,570
You're almost there.

443
00:16:04,570 --> 00:16:06,630
(So Min blocks Kwang Soo
as he tries to interrupt.)

444
00:16:07,730 --> 00:16:09,070
You're almost there. Good.

445
00:16:10,840 --> 00:16:11,940
You're almost there. Good.

446
00:16:13,450 --> 00:16:16,720
(She hit 7 pins.)

447
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:20,450
- Nice, Jong Ok.
- She's the ace player.

448
00:16:20,550 --> 00:16:22,220
- That was nice.
- She's the ace.

449
00:16:22,220 --> 00:16:23,420
That was amazing.

450
00:16:23,420 --> 00:16:24,560
(Excited)

451
00:16:24,650 --> 00:16:25,850
That was great.

452
00:16:25,850 --> 00:16:27,020
It's unbelievable.

453
00:16:27,380 --> 00:16:28,930
(Well done, Suk Jin.)

454
00:16:29,560 --> 00:16:34,330
My gosh. I have a cramp
in my toes.

455
00:16:37,390 --> 00:16:39,230
- Are you having a cramp?
- Yes.

456
00:16:39,310 --> 00:16:41,530
- Take him off of it.
- Relax his muscles.

457
00:16:41,630 --> 00:16:43,130
- What's wrong?
- I have a cramp on my toes.

458
00:16:43,210 --> 00:16:44,500
- Are you having a cramp?
- Yes.

459
00:16:44,500 --> 00:16:46,870
- Massage his toes.
- It's gone.

460
00:16:46,870 --> 00:16:48,770
- Do it a little more.
- A little more?

461
00:16:49,080 --> 00:16:50,220
Good.

462
00:16:50,270 --> 00:16:51,480
- Is it good?
- Okay.

463
00:16:51,480 --> 00:16:53,320
He seems to like this.

464
00:16:53,690 --> 00:16:55,480
- Are you feeling better?
- It feels better.

465
00:16:55,590 --> 00:16:58,010
You're here to work.
What are you doing now?

466
00:16:58,010 --> 00:16:59,930
You are just getting a massage
lying down here.

467
00:16:59,930 --> 00:17:01,620
It's not like you're on vacation.

468
00:17:01,620 --> 00:17:04,830
Hey, it's not that I want
to be on vacation.

469
00:17:05,990 --> 00:17:08,200
(Is he enjoying
the relaxing moment?)

470
00:17:09,390 --> 00:17:10,970
That was good. Hey.

471
00:17:10,970 --> 00:17:12,600
Jong Ok did a very good job.

472
00:17:12,760 --> 00:17:14,900
- I hit seven pins.
- Okay, Jong Ok.

473
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:16,980
Nice.

474
00:17:17,440 --> 00:17:19,370
- Who's next? Hae Sun?
- Yes.

475
00:17:19,480 --> 00:17:20,600
Okay.

476
00:17:20,850 --> 00:17:22,720
- You can go like that.
- Ready, set...

477
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:24,010
Go, Hae Sun!

478
00:17:24,350 --> 00:17:27,140
- Start.
- Just go like that.

479
00:17:27,140 --> 00:17:29,960
- To the left. Good.
- Keep rolling.

480
00:17:29,960 --> 00:17:32,930
I bet Hae Sun never imagined...

481
00:17:32,930 --> 00:17:34,350
she'd play this game.

482
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:36,100
Good. Keep rolling like that.

483
00:17:36,750 --> 00:17:37,830
- A little to the right.
- Good.

484
00:17:37,830 --> 00:17:39,570
- You should hurry.
- You don't have much time.

485
00:17:39,570 --> 00:17:41,930
- You have only 30 seconds.
- To the right.

486
00:17:42,120 --> 00:17:44,300
- You're almost there.
- You should listen to them.

487
00:17:44,360 --> 00:17:45,440
Roll one more time.

488
00:17:45,490 --> 00:17:48,230
(She just needs to overcome
the defensive wall.)

489
00:17:48,500 --> 00:17:51,880
(So Min's defense makes her
lose her bearing.)

490
00:17:52,910 --> 00:17:54,040
Keep rolling!

491
00:17:54,040 --> 00:17:55,710
- Keep rolling!
- Keep rolling!

492
00:17:55,710 --> 00:17:57,510
- Just keep rolling.
- Keep rolling!

493
00:17:57,740 --> 00:17:59,650
- Go straight.
- Go straight.

494
00:17:59,740 --> 00:18:01,150
- One more time.
- Okay.

495
00:18:01,420 --> 00:18:03,980
- She did it.
- Okay.

496
00:18:04,220 --> 00:18:06,050
She did it. It's good.

497
00:18:06,520 --> 00:18:08,250
- Seven pins.
- Okay.

498
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:10,050
- It's not bad.
- She did it.

499
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:11,790
Good. That was nice.

500
00:18:12,820 --> 00:18:15,430
Haha, you should do this.

501
00:18:15,700 --> 00:18:17,700
- Haha, good luck.
- Good luck.

502
00:18:18,330 --> 00:18:19,940
If Haha fails to hit a pin,

503
00:18:19,940 --> 00:18:22,140
- wouldn't it be over?
- Of course, he'll get some.

504
00:18:22,140 --> 00:18:23,270
He'll get 10.

505
00:18:23,710 --> 00:18:25,940
(She's watching.)

506
00:18:25,940 --> 00:18:27,410
- Haha, you're our only hope.
- Okay.

507
00:18:27,410 --> 00:18:29,270
Bring out the Ant-Man.

508
00:18:29,420 --> 00:18:31,540
So Min is a good defensive player.

509
00:18:31,540 --> 00:18:33,740
Kwang Soo, block her.

510
00:18:33,780 --> 00:18:34,780
(Come at me!)

511
00:18:36,890 --> 00:18:39,160
(She's like Bruce Lee.)

512
00:18:40,860 --> 00:18:41,860
What was that?

513
00:18:43,900 --> 00:18:44,930
What are you doing?

514
00:18:44,930 --> 00:18:45,930
This is how I'll be defending...

515
00:18:45,930 --> 00:18:47,730
- when Se Chan comes.
- What?

516
00:18:47,870 --> 00:18:50,230
- Good luck, Haha.
- Good luck!

517
00:18:50,230 --> 00:18:52,640
Jong Ok thinks of him as the ace.

518
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:53,910
- Let's go.
- Go.

519
00:18:54,530 --> 00:18:56,000
- All right.
- Here he goes.

520
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,140
That's good.

521
00:18:57,140 --> 00:18:58,330
- Good job.
- You're fast.

522
00:18:58,330 --> 00:18:59,740
- You're good.
- Go to your right.

523
00:19:00,110 --> 00:19:02,540
- Go to your right.
- You're fast.

524
00:19:02,610 --> 00:19:03,920
- He's fast.
- Go to your right.

525
00:19:03,920 --> 00:19:06,780
- No, no!
- No, no! Not that way!

526
00:19:07,540 --> 00:19:09,480
(She's very into this.)

527
00:19:09,480 --> 00:19:10,620
Go to your left.

528
00:19:10,620 --> 00:19:12,390
This way.

529
00:19:12,390 --> 00:19:13,660
Hey, hey.

530
00:19:14,280 --> 00:19:17,490
Do it one more time!

531
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:20,260
(He needs to roll once more.)

532
00:19:20,260 --> 00:19:21,470
Good job!

533
00:19:23,730 --> 00:19:26,030
(He hits the jackpot.)

534
00:19:26,330 --> 00:19:27,500
Hold on.

535
00:19:27,560 --> 00:19:29,230
- How many were they?
- Nine.

536
00:19:29,230 --> 00:19:30,230
- Did I do well?
- Okay.

537
00:19:30,230 --> 00:19:31,410
You did.

538
00:19:31,410 --> 00:19:32,840
(He's the best.)

539
00:19:32,840 --> 00:19:33,880
Nine?

540
00:19:33,880 --> 00:19:34,950
(Team Jong Ok: 16,
Team Hae Sun: 8)

541
00:19:34,950 --> 00:19:36,000
He did that?

542
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,510
The score is 16 to 8.

543
00:19:37,650 --> 00:19:38,810
No way!

544
00:19:39,070 --> 00:19:41,220
- We're doing well.
- You need to defend well.

545
00:19:41,220 --> 00:19:42,280
- Okay.
- Okay.

546
00:19:42,280 --> 00:19:43,310
- Kwang Soo.
- Yes?

547
00:19:43,310 --> 00:19:45,280
- Block them for me.
- I will.

548
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:47,020
- You can do it Se Chan.
- Got it.

549
00:19:47,020 --> 00:19:48,280
It's easy.

550
00:19:48,390 --> 00:19:50,360
Are you going to roll over me?

551
00:19:50,550 --> 00:19:52,130
- Of course.
- Why?

552
00:19:52,130 --> 00:19:53,130
Good luck.

553
00:19:53,130 --> 00:19:55,020
- Ready, set...
- You need to block him.

554
00:19:55,020 --> 00:19:56,060
(Se Chan sets out.)

555
00:19:56,060 --> 00:19:57,470
Jae Suk, block him.

556
00:19:57,470 --> 00:19:59,640
- Okay. Hey, hey.
- Throw the tray.

557
00:19:59,640 --> 00:20:01,030
- That's good.
- Se Chan.

558
00:20:01,030 --> 00:20:02,110
Grab him.

559
00:20:02,110 --> 00:20:03,140
(He's out of reach.)

560
00:20:03,140 --> 00:20:04,140
That's good.

561
00:20:04,140 --> 00:20:06,500
- Go to the slippery part. No, no!
- That's it!

562
00:20:06,680 --> 00:20:08,210
That's great.

563
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:11,070
(He rolls toward the sticky part.)

564
00:20:11,070 --> 00:20:13,620
That's great! That's great!

565
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:15,120
You're doing well.

566
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:16,550
Get out of there.

567
00:20:16,660 --> 00:20:17,980
- You need to block him.
- Get out.

568
00:20:17,980 --> 00:20:19,250
- Good.
- You need to hold out.

569
00:20:19,630 --> 00:20:21,190
- Good! Se Chan!
- No!

570
00:20:21,190 --> 00:20:23,550
(He just needs to evade So Min.)

571
00:20:23,550 --> 00:20:24,960
- You're almost there!
- Don't block me!

572
00:20:25,660 --> 00:20:27,790
Grab him!

573
00:20:27,790 --> 00:20:28,970
Go, go!

574
00:20:29,130 --> 00:20:31,290
(He grabs Se Chan's pants.)

575
00:20:33,300 --> 00:20:35,300
(He takes them off.)

576
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,000
That's not the way!

577
00:20:39,030 --> 00:20:41,150
(He fights against them...)

578
00:20:41,150 --> 00:20:43,570
(in his long johns.)

579
00:20:47,340 --> 00:20:48,650
Go back!

580
00:20:48,650 --> 00:20:50,920
(The game ends
with him in his long johns.)

581
00:20:50,920 --> 00:20:51,920
Not there!

582
00:20:53,390 --> 00:20:56,130
(The score stays the same.)

583
00:20:56,130 --> 00:20:57,360
Where did you go?

584
00:20:57,360 --> 00:21:00,230
Like so, Team Jong Ok wins.

585
00:21:00,230 --> 00:21:01,670
(Team Jong Ok wins.)

586
00:21:03,670 --> 00:21:05,230
(It's time for them
to pick their bags.)

587
00:21:05,230 --> 00:21:07,760
As you can see,
there are 30 bags each...

588
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:09,730
in the good zone and the bad zone.

589
00:21:09,730 --> 00:21:12,330
In the good zone, there are
19 plus values,

590
00:21:12,330 --> 00:21:13,840
nine minus values,

591
00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:17,310
1 switch chance,
and 1 double chance.

592
00:21:17,310 --> 00:21:19,510
In the bad zone,
there are nine plus values,

593
00:21:19,510 --> 00:21:21,010
19 minus values,

594
00:21:21,010 --> 00:21:22,690
and one switch chance
and double chance each.

595
00:21:22,690 --> 00:21:24,250
There's a total of 30.

596
00:21:24,250 --> 00:21:25,580
(Team Jong Ok will each choose
from the good zone.)

597
00:21:25,580 --> 00:21:26,930
We'll pick from the good zone.

598
00:21:27,250 --> 00:21:30,730
(Team Hae Sun will pick
from the bad zone.)

599
00:21:30,930 --> 00:21:34,200
The plus values range
from 1 dollar to 100 dollars.

600
00:21:34,990 --> 00:21:36,560
It'd be awesome to get 100 dollars.

601
00:21:36,670 --> 00:21:39,170
The minus values range
from 10 dollars to 200 dollars.

602
00:21:39,170 --> 00:21:40,230
Who should go first?

603
00:21:40,230 --> 00:21:41,830
- Should we go first?
- Sure.

604
00:21:41,940 --> 00:21:45,570
You said they had
nine minus values, right?

605
00:21:45,570 --> 00:21:47,480
- Yes.
- Yes.

606
00:21:47,480 --> 00:21:50,450
Let's see... Okay.

607
00:21:50,450 --> 00:21:51,920
(They have a 30-percent chance
of getting a minus value.)

608
00:21:51,920 --> 00:21:52,950
I can't pick.

609
00:21:53,010 --> 00:21:54,420
- Pick whatever.
- Okay.

610
00:21:54,420 --> 00:21:55,420
(Most of them are good anyway.)

611
00:21:55,980 --> 00:21:57,220
I pick number 17.

612
00:21:57,220 --> 00:21:58,280
Okay.

613
00:21:58,690 --> 00:21:59,730
No.

614
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:01,520
Number 17.

615
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:03,250
There are 9 minus values
and 19 good values.

616
00:22:04,520 --> 00:22:05,730
All right!

617
00:22:05,730 --> 00:22:06,730
(What?)

618
00:22:06,730 --> 00:22:08,630
(It's minus 50 dollars.)

619
00:22:08,630 --> 00:22:10,640
- Darn it!
- What is that?

620
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:11,670
Is that a minus value?

621
00:22:11,670 --> 00:22:13,260
- It's a minus value.
- It's a minus value.

622
00:22:13,260 --> 00:22:14,500
That's great.

623
00:22:14,870 --> 00:22:17,300
(He's placed
in the 9th, 10th ranks.)

624
00:22:17,300 --> 00:22:18,610
I can't believe this.

625
00:22:18,610 --> 00:22:20,680
- My gosh.
- The tables could be flipped.

626
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:22,000
Jong Ok.

627
00:22:22,040 --> 00:22:23,380
I can't believe it.

628
00:22:25,220 --> 00:22:27,220
(Which one will she pick?)

629
00:22:27,220 --> 00:22:28,240
Okay.

630
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:30,310
- Jae Suk will pick one next.
- Right.

631
00:22:30,310 --> 00:22:32,480
I'm not lucky
with these types of things.

632
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:33,980
It's Michael Jordan's number.
1, 2, 3.

633
00:22:33,980 --> 00:22:35,860
(She picks
Michael Jordan's number.)

634
00:22:35,960 --> 00:22:37,020
70 dollars.

635
00:22:37,090 --> 00:22:38,700
(She gets 70 dollars.)

636
00:22:38,700 --> 00:22:40,590
(She receives 70 dollars.)

637
00:22:40,870 --> 00:22:43,170
(She reaps the benefit
of choosing from the good zone.)

638
00:22:43,170 --> 00:22:44,560
(She's in 1st place.)

639
00:22:44,560 --> 00:22:45,670
She got 70 dollars.

640
00:22:45,670 --> 00:22:47,210
All right, Suk Jin.

641
00:22:47,260 --> 00:22:48,970
- Hey.
- I pick three.

642
00:22:48,970 --> 00:22:50,570
- Goodness.
- Why?

643
00:22:51,380 --> 00:22:53,000
No, open it from the bottom.

644
00:22:53,300 --> 00:22:54,450
Not there.

645
00:22:54,450 --> 00:22:55,950
This black one.

646
00:22:55,950 --> 00:22:57,420
He doesn't know how to open it.

647
00:22:57,420 --> 00:22:58,650
(Look at him.)

648
00:22:59,540 --> 00:23:00,650
(He's been a member for years now.)

649
00:23:00,650 --> 00:23:02,150
You saw how to open it.

650
00:23:02,150 --> 00:23:03,220
Be quiet.

651
00:23:03,810 --> 00:23:06,050
- Be quiet.
- He doesn't know how to open it.

652
00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:07,780
How could you not know?

653
00:23:07,780 --> 00:23:09,280
(This time, he's determined
to open it.)

654
00:23:11,750 --> 00:23:13,060
- What is it?
- It must be a minus value.

655
00:23:13,060 --> 00:23:14,560
- Is it a chance card?
- Minus 20 dollars.

656
00:23:16,730 --> 00:23:18,140
- No, it's 30 dollars.
- The probability is quite high.

657
00:23:18,370 --> 00:23:20,170
What's wrong with me?

658
00:23:20,260 --> 00:23:22,560
That really wasn't likely.

659
00:23:22,610 --> 00:23:23,910
So Min.

660
00:23:23,910 --> 00:23:25,610
I doubt they've aligned
two minuses together.

661
00:23:26,030 --> 00:23:29,810
- Right. I picked that as well.
- I pick number one.

662
00:23:29,810 --> 00:23:31,570
(Me too.)

663
00:23:31,570 --> 00:23:34,650
- You did? Never mind.
- Yes.

664
00:23:35,420 --> 00:23:37,160
- I wanted number 1.
- Then never mind.

665
00:23:37,250 --> 00:23:38,720
- I pick number 30.
- Pick number 8.

666
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:39,820
I pick number 30.

667
00:23:39,820 --> 00:23:42,020
(She picks number 30 instead.)

668
00:23:42,230 --> 00:23:43,490
(What has she picked?)

669
00:23:43,490 --> 00:23:44,700
- What is it?
- What is it?

670
00:23:44,700 --> 00:23:46,970
(Minus 100 dollars)

671
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:49,630
(She picks minus 100 dollars.)

672
00:23:49,630 --> 00:23:51,260
- Minus 100 dollars?
- Goodness.

673
00:23:51,260 --> 00:23:53,370
- What was that?
- I was lucky!

674
00:23:53,560 --> 00:23:54,800
Minus 100 dollars?

675
00:23:54,800 --> 00:23:56,260
(Is that seriously the good zone?)

676
00:23:56,260 --> 00:23:57,640
How is this possible?

677
00:23:57,980 --> 00:23:59,110
- My goodness.
- What did you say?

678
00:23:59,110 --> 00:24:00,300
We can beat them for sure.

679
00:24:00,650 --> 00:24:02,070
What's wrong with us?

680
00:24:02,070 --> 00:24:04,380
I'll pick the one from before.

681
00:24:04,380 --> 00:24:06,920
- So Min, why did you discard this?
- Let me see.

682
00:24:06,920 --> 00:24:08,420
It felt ominous
that you had picked it.

683
00:24:08,420 --> 00:24:10,010
That's not it. Wait.

684
00:24:10,580 --> 00:24:12,620
(Plus 20 dollars)

685
00:24:12,620 --> 00:24:13,660
It's 20 dollars.

686
00:24:14,360 --> 00:24:16,730
- It's not a lot.
- He's not extremely lucky.

687
00:24:16,730 --> 00:24:18,860
I thought this was the good zone.

688
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:21,290
But three of us got minus values.

689
00:24:21,430 --> 00:24:23,060
If we win next round...

690
00:24:23,060 --> 00:24:25,400
- We'll get the good ones.
- We'll beat them for sure.

691
00:24:25,670 --> 00:24:27,640
- Go on.
- Who's first? Kwang Soo?

692
00:24:27,640 --> 00:24:29,030
Okay. I pick number 13.

693
00:24:29,030 --> 00:24:30,610
(Kwang Soo goes 1st
and picks number 13.)

694
00:24:31,270 --> 00:24:32,530
This is so annoying.

695
00:24:33,300 --> 00:24:34,800
I'm sure Kwang Soo
got a minus value.

696
00:24:35,650 --> 00:24:37,120
- Of course.
- 70 dollars!

697
00:24:37,340 --> 00:24:38,450
What's gotten into him?

698
00:24:39,310 --> 00:24:40,480
(It's the bad zone.)

699
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:43,250
(But he receives 70 dollars.)

700
00:24:43,360 --> 00:24:44,620
70 dollars!

701
00:24:45,980 --> 00:24:47,020
Seriously?

702
00:24:47,020 --> 00:24:48,130
- 70 dollars.
- What's going on?

703
00:24:48,130 --> 00:24:49,230
What's going on?

704
00:24:49,360 --> 00:24:51,520
- Our situations have changed.
- This is strange.

705
00:24:51,520 --> 00:24:53,790
Are you sure
you got the zones right?

706
00:24:53,790 --> 00:24:55,090
- Are you sure?
- Yes.

707
00:24:55,090 --> 00:24:56,970
They only have nine plus values.

708
00:24:57,030 --> 00:24:59,370
- That's odd.
- It doesn't make any sense.

709
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:00,940
Are you sure you didn't make
a mistake?

710
00:25:00,940 --> 00:25:02,470
Yes, we're sure.

711
00:25:02,610 --> 00:25:04,610
- That one seems good.
- How is this possible?

712
00:25:04,610 --> 00:25:06,230
This is meaningless.

713
00:25:06,230 --> 00:25:07,500
We'll find out this time for sure.

714
00:25:07,500 --> 00:25:08,500
(Everyone is focused
on Jong Kook's bag.)

715
00:25:08,740 --> 00:25:09,980
- What?
- Darn it.

716
00:25:10,150 --> 00:25:11,240
- Gosh.
- It's a minus value.

717
00:25:11,240 --> 00:25:12,240
What is it?

718
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:13,540
- Gosh.
- It's a minus value.

719
00:25:13,810 --> 00:25:14,950
(His eyes are wide open.)

720
00:25:14,950 --> 00:25:16,010
How much is it?

721
00:25:16,510 --> 00:25:19,390
(What is the amount?)

722
00:25:21,630 --> 00:25:23,050
I think it's minus 200 dollars.

723
00:25:23,050 --> 00:25:24,050
It is.

724
00:25:24,900 --> 00:25:27,970
(The probability was 1 out of 30.)

725
00:25:28,470 --> 00:25:31,640
- Minus 200 dollars.
- Minus 200 dollars!

726
00:25:31,970 --> 00:25:33,640
- Minus 200 dollars?
- Nice.

727
00:25:33,640 --> 00:25:36,060
- Yes!
- He got minus 200 dollars.

728
00:25:36,060 --> 00:25:37,710
This one really caught my eye.

729
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:40,040
- 20 dollars.
- 30 dollars.

730
00:25:40,040 --> 00:25:41,450
(Hae Sun and Ji Hyo got plus,
and Se Chan got minus.)

731
00:25:41,450 --> 00:25:42,650
I didn't beat them?

732
00:25:42,650 --> 00:25:44,310
(Final result for round 1)

733
00:25:44,310 --> 00:25:46,890
(Jong Ok and Kwang Soo
are leading.)

734
00:25:46,890 --> 00:25:49,480
(So Min, Se Chan, and Jong Kook
are the last ones.)

735
00:25:50,120 --> 00:25:51,360
Sit here, Suk Jin.

736
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:52,360
(After their first game)

737
00:25:52,510 --> 00:25:53,780
I'm in first place.

738
00:25:54,320 --> 00:25:55,960
Jong Ok and Kwang Soo
are at the top.

739
00:25:56,020 --> 00:25:57,430
I can't believe he's up there.

740
00:25:57,430 --> 00:25:59,520
I doubt I'll come last today.

741
00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:01,790
- Okay, okay.
- I should do better.

742
00:26:02,790 --> 00:26:03,830
I should avoid the penalty.

743
00:26:03,830 --> 00:26:06,940
For the second team mission,
your lunch menu is on the line.

744
00:26:06,940 --> 00:26:08,670
It's called Calculated Auction.

745
00:26:08,670 --> 00:26:09,910
- Calculated?
- Auction?

746
00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:12,330
- It's calculated?
- After seeing the lunch menu,

747
00:26:12,330 --> 00:26:13,880
both teams will auction.

748
00:26:14,150 --> 00:26:16,040
There will be
a total of five rounds.

749
00:26:16,270 --> 00:26:18,770
For this round, you won't use
your R money.

750
00:26:18,770 --> 00:26:22,540
We will give you fake cash
just for this mission.

751
00:26:22,620 --> 00:26:24,310
Each of you will receive
10 dollars each.

752
00:26:24,310 --> 00:26:25,980
Each team will have 50 dollars.

753
00:26:26,630 --> 00:26:30,630
You can bid as much
as you want for each dish.

754
00:26:30,630 --> 00:26:34,170
The team with the higher amount
of money will get the dish.

755
00:26:34,170 --> 00:26:35,170
(The food goes to the highest bid.)

756
00:26:35,990 --> 00:26:38,970
If you think the other team
will spend 10 dollars,

757
00:26:38,970 --> 00:26:41,500
you can agree to spend
more than that.

758
00:26:41,530 --> 00:26:42,830
That's how you'll play.

759
00:26:42,830 --> 00:26:45,380
If both teams pay the same amount,

760
00:26:45,380 --> 00:26:47,650
the dish and your money
will both disappear.

761
00:26:47,650 --> 00:26:50,180
The team that wins
3 dishes 1st wins.

762
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:52,150
The winning team will get...

763
00:26:52,150 --> 00:26:54,190
- to eat them.
- Really?

764
00:26:54,390 --> 00:26:57,280
Even if the losing team
has won 1 or 2 dishes,

765
00:26:57,280 --> 00:26:59,550
they will only be given
laver and rice.

766
00:26:59,550 --> 00:27:01,020
Laver and rice would be...

767
00:27:01,050 --> 00:27:03,750
However, the member
with the most amount...

768
00:27:03,930 --> 00:27:06,320
of remaining cash
in the losing team...

769
00:27:06,320 --> 00:27:08,320
will have the chance
to eat the dishes...

770
00:27:08,320 --> 00:27:11,060
and pick a bag from the good zone.

771
00:27:11,060 --> 00:27:13,610
There's always a catch.

772
00:27:13,610 --> 00:27:15,300
They're preventing us
from spending as much as we want.

773
00:27:15,300 --> 00:27:16,770
They're playing smart.

774
00:27:16,770 --> 00:27:18,680
You'll get to eat for sure
if you don't spend any money.

775
00:27:18,940 --> 00:27:20,110
Kwang Soo.

776
00:27:20,110 --> 00:27:21,710
I'm so glad that they have you.

777
00:27:23,180 --> 00:27:24,240
(He's the epitome of betrayal.)

778
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:25,310
Not at all.

779
00:27:25,310 --> 00:27:27,310
- If we all win, we'll get to eat.
- Right.

780
00:27:27,310 --> 00:27:30,190
- Why are you stuttering?
- I'm sick and tired of hearing it.

781
00:27:30,190 --> 00:27:31,620
- I'm serious.
- "Not at all."

782
00:27:31,620 --> 00:27:33,390
- "If we all win, we'll get to eat."
- We need to work together.

783
00:27:33,390 --> 00:27:34,390
Here's your first menu.

784
00:27:34,390 --> 00:27:35,460
All right.

785
00:27:35,460 --> 00:27:36,900
- Let's hear it.
- Your first dish...

786
00:27:37,930 --> 00:27:39,360
is gim-tteok-sun set.

787
00:27:40,020 --> 00:27:41,730
(They're the 3 most popular
snack foods.)

788
00:27:41,730 --> 00:27:42,790
- Gimbap, tteokbokki, and sundae.
- Hey.

789
00:27:42,790 --> 00:27:44,670
- I'm going to spend three dollars.
- This one's nice.

790
00:27:44,670 --> 00:27:45,760
I'm going to splurge.

791
00:27:45,760 --> 00:27:49,060
You can discuss
with your team members.

792
00:27:49,470 --> 00:27:52,210
I think we should spend a little
first and see how they spend theirs.

793
00:27:52,610 --> 00:27:55,480
We should at least spend
a dollar each and see.

794
00:27:55,740 --> 00:27:57,650
- Should we do that?
- We need to feel them out.

795
00:27:58,450 --> 00:28:00,120
(A dollar?)

796
00:28:00,540 --> 00:28:01,980
Kwang Soo, wake up.

797
00:28:01,980 --> 00:28:03,240
- Kwang Soo, no.
- It's a dollar.

798
00:28:03,240 --> 00:28:05,860
(Kwang Soo, wake up. It's a dollar.)

799
00:28:06,080 --> 00:28:07,780
You'll still have nine dollars left.

800
00:28:07,780 --> 00:28:10,200
It's only fake money,
so why am I being stingy?

801
00:28:10,200 --> 00:28:11,550
- Kwang Soo.
- Only a dollar.

802
00:28:11,550 --> 00:28:13,700
I think we could eat it
with five dollars.

803
00:28:14,930 --> 00:28:17,230
Let's have it.

804
00:28:17,230 --> 00:28:19,260
Should we spend a dollar each?

805
00:28:19,260 --> 00:28:20,640
- A dollar each?
- Yes.

806
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:22,210
We might win just with
a dollar each.

807
00:28:22,800 --> 00:28:24,500
It's not something
worth investing in.

808
00:28:24,500 --> 00:28:26,610
Even though we don't want it,

809
00:28:26,610 --> 00:28:27,910
we should obtain it as insurance.

810
00:28:27,910 --> 00:28:29,110
Jong Ok, pay up a dollar.

811
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:31,980
Shall we go ahead?

812
00:28:32,010 --> 00:28:33,420
Write down your name and amount.

813
00:28:33,420 --> 00:28:35,280
There's nothing to be upset about.

814
00:28:35,280 --> 00:28:36,690
We'll only bid a small amount.

815
00:28:36,920 --> 00:28:38,080
- How about this much?
- That much?

816
00:28:38,080 --> 00:28:39,810
- Sure.
- Okay.

817
00:28:39,810 --> 00:28:40,960
It's only the first one.

818
00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:42,130
How much did you pay?

819
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:44,750
(Did they all pay a dollar
as they agreed to?)

820
00:28:45,860 --> 00:28:47,790
(Kwang Soo's paper is clean.)

821
00:28:47,790 --> 00:28:48,970
By the way...

822
00:28:49,520 --> 00:28:52,290
Kwang Soo, write it down.

823
00:28:52,290 --> 00:28:53,760
- I did.
- Let me see.

824
00:28:53,760 --> 00:28:55,410
- Hold on.
- I will once you write down yours.

825
00:28:55,410 --> 00:28:56,440
I'll do it once you do.

826
00:28:56,440 --> 00:28:58,770
- You go first.
- Why did you lie to me then?

827
00:28:58,800 --> 00:29:00,980
- Okay, go ahead.
- It's only the first round.

828
00:29:00,980 --> 00:29:02,070
Right, okay.

829
00:29:02,500 --> 00:29:04,340
- I wrote it down.
- It needs to be a whole number.

830
00:29:04,340 --> 00:29:06,010
- I wrote down a dollar.
- Make it a whole number.

831
00:29:06,010 --> 00:29:08,240
- But I did.
- Why would you write 0.6 dollars?

832
00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:09,450
(Why would you write 0.6 dollars?)

833
00:29:09,450 --> 00:29:10,810
Why would you write down
0.6 dollars?

834
00:29:10,810 --> 00:29:12,120
- But I did.
- I saw 0.6 dollars.

835
00:29:12,120 --> 00:29:13,250
(Glancing)

836
00:29:13,980 --> 00:29:15,690
- Get over here.
- Make it a whole number.

837
00:29:15,690 --> 00:29:17,090
He wrote down 0.6 dollars.

838
00:29:18,130 --> 00:29:20,590
Must you be that dirty?

839
00:29:20,590 --> 00:29:21,760
Beats me.

840
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:24,400
- We kept it anonymous.
- Us too.

841
00:29:24,870 --> 00:29:26,870
They put down the same amount as us.

842
00:29:27,610 --> 00:29:29,060
What we have left...

843
00:29:29,060 --> 00:29:30,710
- Exactly.
- They don't get...

844
00:29:30,710 --> 00:29:32,300
what we have left,
so it's important to win.

845
00:29:32,300 --> 00:29:34,070
Yes, the objective
is to win the dish.

846
00:29:34,570 --> 00:29:36,710
I wrote it down.

847
00:29:36,710 --> 00:29:38,740
You shouldn't be showing me that.

848
00:29:38,920 --> 00:29:39,980
You're the one who looked.

849
00:29:39,980 --> 00:29:41,040
There's no need to.

850
00:29:41,040 --> 00:29:42,220
But you looked.

851
00:29:42,220 --> 00:29:44,120
- This isn't me doubting you.
- I think it's a tie.

852
00:29:44,120 --> 00:29:46,310
Suk Jin saw what I wrote down.

853
00:29:46,360 --> 00:29:47,930
- I did.
- He saw what I wrote down.

854
00:29:47,930 --> 00:29:48,960
We should do this.

855
00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:51,200
- Hold on.
- I'm so disappointed in Suk Jin.

856
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:53,990
(Jae Suk doesn't trust him.)

857
00:29:53,990 --> 00:29:55,760
We don't believe him.

858
00:29:56,490 --> 00:29:59,670
(Both teams agreed
to bid 5 dollars.)

859
00:29:59,670 --> 00:30:03,500
The team that won
the gim-tteok-sun set is...

860
00:30:03,500 --> 00:30:04,880
- Which team is it?
- Is there a winner?

861
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:05,980
- Is there a winner?
- It should be ours.

862
00:30:05,980 --> 00:30:07,570
I bet it's ours.

863
00:30:07,710 --> 00:30:09,950
The team that won
the gim-tteok-sun set is...

864
00:30:10,420 --> 00:30:11,680
Both teams...

865
00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:14,340
(Both teams?)

866
00:30:14,920 --> 00:30:16,690
You bid the same amount,
so no one gets the food.

867
00:30:16,690 --> 00:30:18,550
- What?
- You bid the same amount...

868
00:30:18,550 --> 00:30:20,010
(No one won the food.)

869
00:30:20,010 --> 00:30:21,980
Really? Everyone
must've bid something.

870
00:30:22,050 --> 00:30:23,960
You all bid the same amount?

871
00:30:23,960 --> 00:30:24,960
(Did both teams bid 5 dollars?)

872
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:26,020
Both teams...

873
00:30:27,470 --> 00:30:28,590
bid four dollars.

874
00:30:28,590 --> 00:30:29,970
(Both teams bid 4 dollars.)

875
00:30:29,970 --> 00:30:31,170
(But we agreed on 5 dollars.)

876
00:30:31,170 --> 00:30:33,090
Which one of you betrayed us?

877
00:30:33,090 --> 00:30:35,670
Who betrayed us?
I said five dollars was enough!

878
00:30:35,670 --> 00:30:37,030
- I told you to write down a dollar.
- It was just a dollar.

879
00:30:37,030 --> 00:30:38,410
- Unbelievable.
- Who was it?

880
00:30:38,410 --> 00:30:40,240
- You saw me write it down.
- You!

881
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:41,980
- I saw you write it down.
- It was Suk Jin...

882
00:30:41,980 --> 00:30:44,220
- who acted strangely.
- I saw Jong Ok write hers down.

883
00:30:44,220 --> 00:30:45,810
- We can vouch for each other.
- That's right.

884
00:30:45,810 --> 00:30:47,620
You could've sent in
a different piece of paper.

885
00:30:47,620 --> 00:30:50,510
You turned around
and wrote something down.

886
00:30:50,510 --> 00:30:53,010
You're unbelievable.
What did I tell you?

887
00:30:53,010 --> 00:30:54,930
I said that five dollars was enough.

888
00:30:54,930 --> 00:30:56,580
- He's right.
- Viewers know the truth, right?

889
00:30:56,580 --> 00:30:58,130
You know I'm innocent.

890
00:30:58,130 --> 00:31:00,020
- So Min...
- Jae Suk, come on.

891
00:31:00,520 --> 00:31:02,520
- Right, I saw So Min's.
- That's right.

892
00:31:02,520 --> 00:31:04,290
Everyone saw what I wrote down.

893
00:31:04,290 --> 00:31:06,490
- It's him.
- You're all a bunch of jerks.

894
00:31:06,490 --> 00:31:08,670
Except you, of course, Jong Ok.

895
00:31:08,670 --> 00:31:10,680
(Laughing)

896
00:31:10,800 --> 00:31:12,230
I can't believe this.

897
00:31:13,610 --> 00:31:15,710
Both teams bid four dollars.

898
00:31:16,180 --> 00:31:17,420
(What?)

899
00:31:17,980 --> 00:31:20,450
(Why is she suddenly yelling?)

900
00:31:20,450 --> 00:31:21,450
It was you, wasn't it?

901
00:31:21,450 --> 00:31:22,810
Unbelievable.

902
00:31:22,810 --> 00:31:24,250
I bet it was Hae Sun.

903
00:31:24,250 --> 00:31:25,620
You wrote it down, right?

904
00:31:25,620 --> 00:31:26,720
You saw it. I showed you.

905
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:28,130
But still...

906
00:31:28,130 --> 00:31:29,130
Didn't you write it down?

907
00:31:29,130 --> 00:31:31,050
I wrote the amount down in Korean.

908
00:31:31,050 --> 00:31:32,590
- You saw mine.
- Hold on.

909
00:31:32,590 --> 00:31:34,870
She wouldn't suspect you
if she wasn't the traitor.

910
00:31:34,870 --> 00:31:36,400
- Her expression...
- I wrote it down.

911
00:31:37,490 --> 00:31:40,210
- Unbelievable.
- This is how it'll be?

912
00:31:40,210 --> 00:31:41,710
- Okay.
- Will this be revealed?

913
00:31:41,710 --> 00:31:43,140
- Don't know.
- It will be, right?

914
00:31:43,610 --> 00:31:45,110
I'm certain it was her.

915
00:31:45,410 --> 00:31:48,450
Does this mean that
we lost the dollar we wrote down?

916
00:31:48,800 --> 00:31:50,920
- Yes, it's gone.
- You've got to be kidding me.

917
00:31:50,920 --> 00:31:52,620
(Yes, it's gone.)

918
00:31:52,620 --> 00:31:55,340
Jong Kook, it's Kwang Soo.

919
00:31:55,340 --> 00:31:56,920
You're actually checking
if we lost the money?

920
00:31:56,920 --> 00:31:58,250
You checked if
your money was intact.

921
00:31:58,250 --> 00:31:59,550
- That's not it.
- Save it.

922
00:31:59,690 --> 00:32:00,820
You're the worst.

923
00:32:00,820 --> 00:32:02,160
- I didn't betray you.
- Don't you dare eat anything.

924
00:32:02,160 --> 00:32:04,090
Wait, come on. If I could...

925
00:32:04,090 --> 00:32:05,790
You're not allowed to eat anything.

926
00:32:05,790 --> 00:32:07,060
Don't you dare eat.

927
00:32:07,760 --> 00:32:09,130
Let's move on to the next menu.

928
00:32:09,170 --> 00:32:11,290
It's one whole pizza and coke.

929
00:32:11,290 --> 00:32:13,710
- Coke.
- I really want that.

930
00:32:14,300 --> 00:32:15,300
We must have this.

931
00:32:15,300 --> 00:32:16,800
We can't pass up on this.

932
00:32:16,800 --> 00:32:18,680
- All right.
- Was it Jae Suk then?

933
00:32:18,710 --> 00:32:20,650
Jong Ok, how about seven dollars?

934
00:32:20,710 --> 00:32:22,610
Why was it not five dollars then?

935
00:32:22,980 --> 00:32:24,720
- Did you write it down?
- I did.

936
00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:26,040
- Stop arguing.
- Really?

937
00:32:26,040 --> 00:32:27,890
I did nothing to be ashamed of.

938
00:32:27,890 --> 00:32:29,980
- Me too.
- Let's curse one another.

939
00:32:29,980 --> 00:32:32,420
If I am lying about this,

940
00:32:32,420 --> 00:32:33,630
my family will go broke.

941
00:32:33,630 --> 00:32:35,190
(He's dead serious.)

942
00:32:36,780 --> 00:32:37,900
- That's a strong one.
- Must you go that far?

943
00:32:37,900 --> 00:32:38,960
I'm that serious.

944
00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:40,130
- I'm serious.
- Why go that far?

945
00:32:40,130 --> 00:32:41,790
Because I'm dead serious.

946
00:32:41,790 --> 00:32:43,290
If I am lying about this,

947
00:32:43,290 --> 00:32:45,590
my family will live as slaves
for generations.

948
00:32:45,590 --> 00:32:46,590
(My family will live as slaves
for generations.)

949
00:32:46,590 --> 00:32:48,030
- What?
- I'm dead serious.

950
00:32:48,030 --> 00:32:49,410
Me too!

951
00:32:49,410 --> 00:32:50,800
Let's not go that far.

952
00:32:50,800 --> 00:32:52,070
Why not?

953
00:32:52,070 --> 00:32:53,710
- Just don't.
- It was you, wasn't it?

954
00:32:53,710 --> 00:32:55,410
- So Min, go ahead.
- Must we go this far?

955
00:32:55,410 --> 00:32:57,120
- We've narrowed it down.
- Exactly.

956
00:32:57,120 --> 00:32:58,450
- How about it?
- All right.

957
00:32:58,450 --> 00:32:59,540
We have our suspects.

958
00:33:00,040 --> 00:33:02,040
- Suk Jin, be honest.
- It's your last chance...

959
00:33:02,040 --> 00:33:04,420
to apologize.
We'll forget about it then.

960
00:33:04,420 --> 00:33:06,160
- Apologize.
- We won't hold it against you.

961
00:33:06,160 --> 00:33:07,750
- Consider your future.
- Just apologize.

962
00:33:07,750 --> 00:33:09,130
- Apologize.
- Apologize.

963
00:33:09,130 --> 00:33:10,960
- See?
- Apologize.

964
00:33:10,960 --> 00:33:12,020
(She turns herself in.)

965
00:33:13,250 --> 00:33:14,990
(She wasn't able to lie.)

966
00:33:14,990 --> 00:33:17,440
- Apologize.
- Just apologize.

967
00:33:17,440 --> 00:33:19,490
(While everyone
was looking the other way,)

968
00:33:19,490 --> 00:33:22,410
(she changed her number to 0.)

969
00:33:23,300 --> 00:33:25,000
(If anyone asks about
the future of con artists,)

970
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:27,710
(tell them about So Min.)

971
00:33:27,710 --> 00:33:29,450
- I'm sorry.
- We'll forgive you but...

972
00:33:29,450 --> 00:33:30,980
- From here on out...
- Let's try this.

973
00:33:30,980 --> 00:33:32,270
(He shows mercy.)

974
00:33:32,380 --> 00:33:33,420
- From here on out...
- Let's try this.

975
00:33:33,420 --> 00:33:35,040
Wait, hear me out.

976
00:33:35,120 --> 00:33:37,690
- Gather around.
- Don't upset me again.

977
00:33:37,690 --> 00:33:39,620
Did you have to take it that far?

978
00:33:39,620 --> 00:33:42,160
This time, I'll write this.

979
00:33:42,160 --> 00:33:43,250
- You?
- We should eat this dish.

980
00:33:43,250 --> 00:33:44,400
Me too?

981
00:33:44,400 --> 00:33:46,290
- Jong Kook, me too.
- I'll pay this much.

982
00:33:46,290 --> 00:33:47,430
- I'll pay this much.
- Me too.

983
00:33:47,430 --> 00:33:48,870
It's like this. Here.

984
00:33:48,870 --> 00:33:50,230
But then in the next round...

985
00:33:50,230 --> 00:33:51,990
Can't you see
we're discussing something?

986
00:33:51,990 --> 00:33:53,200
- Hey.
- Stop butting in.

987
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:54,500
Mister, look here.

988
00:33:54,500 --> 00:33:56,170
- Get away from us.
- But I paid!

989
00:33:56,170 --> 00:33:57,300
Stay put.

990
00:33:57,300 --> 00:33:58,910
(Yelling in desperation)

991
00:33:58,910 --> 00:34:01,610
(Is he truly being
wrongfully accused?)

992
00:34:02,480 --> 00:34:04,920
(A second before he turned his in,)

993
00:34:04,920 --> 00:34:06,720
(he changed his number.)

994
00:34:08,190 --> 00:34:09,720
(0 dollars)

995
00:34:10,460 --> 00:34:13,190
(Don't worry. The hand
is quicker than the eye.)

996
00:34:13,190 --> 00:34:15,780
- Kwang Soo betrayed us.
- I knew it!

997
00:34:15,780 --> 00:34:18,750
What a weasel you are!

998
00:34:18,750 --> 00:34:20,020
He's incorrigible.

999
00:34:20,020 --> 00:34:21,670
(Kwang Soo's team members
already assume it's him.)

1000
00:34:21,670 --> 00:34:23,520
We're not going to consider
you a team member,

1001
00:34:23,520 --> 00:34:24,700
so go over there.

1002
00:34:24,700 --> 00:34:25,700
We're not going to consider
you a team member,

1003
00:34:25,700 --> 00:34:26,700
so go over there.

1004
00:34:26,700 --> 00:34:28,410
Go. Leave.

1005
00:34:28,410 --> 00:34:29,610
- What?
- Get lost.

1006
00:34:29,610 --> 00:34:32,210
You can't do this to me.

1007
00:34:32,500 --> 00:34:34,800
All right,
let's decide on an amount.

1008
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:36,410
(His history of betrayal
is what caused this.)

1009
00:34:36,980 --> 00:34:38,650
Let me say this one thing.

1010
00:34:39,340 --> 00:34:40,580
She'll pay three dollars,

1011
00:34:40,620 --> 00:34:41,780
- and we'll pay a dollar.
- Okay.

1012
00:34:41,780 --> 00:34:42,780
(Jong Ok's plan)

1013
00:34:42,780 --> 00:34:44,460
- I'll pay two dollars.
- Okay.

1014
00:34:44,460 --> 00:34:46,690
- Gosh, you're the best.
- Jong Ok...

1015
00:34:46,690 --> 00:34:48,190
- It's all right.
- Hold on.

1016
00:34:48,190 --> 00:34:51,130
If that's the case,
I'll only pay two dollars.

1017
00:34:51,130 --> 00:34:52,700
- What?
- Why you...

1018
00:34:52,700 --> 00:34:53,860
Seriously?

1019
00:34:53,860 --> 00:34:56,260
You're the reason why
we lost the first round!

1020
00:34:56,260 --> 00:34:58,590
If you don't pay up this time,
Jong Ok will slap you.

1021
00:34:58,590 --> 00:35:00,440
I'll slap you hard.

1022
00:35:01,800 --> 00:35:04,900
(If you betray us again...)

1023
00:35:05,900 --> 00:35:07,550
(She taught So Min a lesson
with her strong pronunciation.)

1024
00:35:07,550 --> 00:35:08,670
- "I'll slap you hard."
- "I'll slap you hard."

1025
00:35:08,670 --> 00:35:10,280
- She'll slap you hard.
- As if she's acting.

1026
00:35:10,280 --> 00:35:12,340
- I'm good at slapping people.
- She means it.

1027
00:35:12,340 --> 00:35:14,010
- I never hesitate.
- She's serious.

1028
00:35:14,010 --> 00:35:15,420
I already feel like
I've been slapped.

1029
00:35:15,420 --> 00:35:17,260
- It hurts.
- If you don't pay up this time...

1030
00:35:17,260 --> 00:35:18,510
- She'll slap me hard.
- Exactly.

1031
00:35:18,510 --> 00:35:20,920
- Where though?
- If we win this dish,

1032
00:35:20,920 --> 00:35:23,690
Kwang Soo can pay
the entire amount in the next round.

1033
00:35:23,690 --> 00:35:25,130
- It's a team game.
- But if we win...

1034
00:35:25,130 --> 00:35:27,190
Yes, he could do that.

1035
00:35:27,190 --> 00:35:28,590
- He can.
- So this time...

1036
00:35:28,590 --> 00:35:29,900
There could be an opportunity.

1037
00:35:29,900 --> 00:35:31,170
- Right.
- So stay put.

1038
00:35:31,170 --> 00:35:32,260
Kwang Soo...

1039
00:35:32,260 --> 00:35:34,510
Stay put? Must you talk to me
like I'm your pet dog?

1040
00:35:34,510 --> 00:35:37,240
- Sorry.
- That's what you say to dogs.

1041
00:35:37,240 --> 00:35:38,610
So stay put.

1042
00:35:38,610 --> 00:35:41,670
(She gave him the order
people give to dogs.)

1043
00:35:42,170 --> 00:35:44,420
Gosh, I'm sorry.

1044
00:35:44,420 --> 00:35:46,880
We'll be fools
not to use him though.

1045
00:35:46,880 --> 00:35:48,090
Yes, you're right.

1046
00:35:48,090 --> 00:35:50,110
That makes you Chil Deuk.

1047
00:35:50,110 --> 00:35:51,320
- Then...
- You're Chil Deuk.

1048
00:35:51,320 --> 00:35:52,510
- Right.
- Then...

1049
00:35:52,510 --> 00:35:53,920
Will you be Chil Deuk?

1050
00:35:53,920 --> 00:35:55,280
- What do I write down?
- Just answer the question.

1051
00:35:55,280 --> 00:35:57,320
- Chil Deuk?
- Will you be Chil Deuk?

1052
00:35:57,320 --> 00:35:58,960
I've been Chil Deuk
for a long time now.

1053
00:36:00,260 --> 00:36:02,960
- Even I think we look alike.
- Right?

1054
00:36:03,030 --> 00:36:05,090
She'll slap you hard.

1055
00:36:05,090 --> 00:36:07,300
(The estimated price of both teams:
unknown versus 8 dollars)

1056
00:36:07,340 --> 00:36:09,610
- So in this round...
- No way.

1057
00:36:09,610 --> 00:36:12,400
The team that'll win
the pizza and coke set is...

1058
00:36:13,610 --> 00:36:19,320
(Which team will win
the one whole pizza and coke?)

1059
00:36:21,920 --> 00:36:23,210
Congratulations.

1060
00:36:25,260 --> 00:36:27,420
(Team Hae Sun wins!)

1061
00:36:27,420 --> 00:36:29,050
- Team Hae Sun.
- Nice!

1062
00:36:29,050 --> 00:36:30,380
Nice. How much was it?

1063
00:36:30,380 --> 00:36:31,400
- How much?
- What was the price?

1064
00:36:31,400 --> 00:36:33,590
- How much was it?
- Let me reveal the price.

1065
00:36:33,590 --> 00:36:34,590
It was 12 dollars to 8 dollars.

1066
00:36:34,590 --> 00:36:36,090
- What did I say?
- No way.

1067
00:36:36,090 --> 00:36:37,690
Weren't I on point?

1068
00:36:37,690 --> 00:36:39,990
- You were right.
- I knew they wouldn't pay up.

1069
00:36:39,990 --> 00:36:41,210
They...

1070
00:36:42,610 --> 00:36:43,840
This is what we'll pay.

1071
00:36:44,300 --> 00:36:46,280
(They agreed on 3 dollars each.)

1072
00:36:47,030 --> 00:36:51,010
(Except for Kwang Soo,
they paid 3 dollars each.)

1073
00:36:51,780 --> 00:36:56,090
(They will utilize what Kwang Soo
has in the next round.)

1074
00:36:56,740 --> 00:36:58,990
(I have nothing to lose then.)

1075
00:36:59,610 --> 00:37:03,090
(They put their trust in one another
and bet 3 dollars.)

1076
00:37:03,280 --> 00:37:06,190
(Kwang Soo bet 0 dollars
just like they planned.)

1077
00:37:06,650 --> 00:37:08,590
- Nice!
- That was so clever.

1078
00:37:08,590 --> 00:37:10,230
- See?
- Amazing.

1079
00:37:10,230 --> 00:37:11,690
- We would've lost anyway.
- I told you...

1080
00:37:11,690 --> 00:37:13,090
that they would bet 12 dollars.

1081
00:37:13,090 --> 00:37:14,610
I paid up this time.

1082
00:37:14,610 --> 00:37:15,940
I really did.

1083
00:37:16,860 --> 00:37:18,280
The next is jjajangmyeon
and jjamppong.

1084
00:37:18,280 --> 00:37:19,400
This we must eat.

1085
00:37:19,400 --> 00:37:21,300
- All right.
- The set will go to...

1086
00:37:21,300 --> 00:37:23,340
- Team Hae Sun.
- Okay!

1087
00:37:23,340 --> 00:37:25,780
Team Jong Ok has 31 dollars left...

1088
00:37:25,780 --> 00:37:27,610
while Team Hae Sun has 26 dollars.

1089
00:37:27,610 --> 00:37:28,610
(Team Jong Ok, 0 wins,
Team Hae Sun, 2 wins)

1090
00:37:28,610 --> 00:37:30,340
The next set...

1091
00:37:30,340 --> 00:37:32,320
is cake and iced coffee.

1092
00:37:32,320 --> 00:37:33,320
Desserts.

1093
00:37:33,320 --> 00:37:36,280
Kwang Soo, you're up.
Meet our expectations.

1094
00:37:36,280 --> 00:37:38,090
- You can do it.
- Even if we lose,

1095
00:37:38,090 --> 00:37:40,190
you can save face with what you bet.

1096
00:37:40,190 --> 00:37:42,800
- I won't call you Chil Deuk.
- Me neither.

1097
00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:44,690
Don't call me Chil Deuk...

1098
00:37:44,690 --> 00:37:46,240
and Hae Sun will stop nodding at me.

1099
00:37:46,690 --> 00:37:48,710
- We won't.
- I promise not to.

1100
00:37:48,710 --> 00:37:50,610
- I promise.
- If you...

1101
00:37:50,610 --> 00:37:52,800
don't win these desserts
for us though,

1102
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:54,210
we'll all call you Chil Deuk...

1103
00:37:54,210 --> 00:37:55,650
until the show is over.

1104
00:37:56,240 --> 00:37:58,420
We need to win
the two rounds now.

1105
00:37:58,420 --> 00:37:59,420
That's right.

1106
00:37:59,420 --> 00:38:02,110
We're at a disadvantage though.

1107
00:38:02,110 --> 00:38:03,280
- I know.
- This time,

1108
00:38:03,280 --> 00:38:04,920
they'll bet a large amount.

1109
00:38:04,920 --> 00:38:06,610
Yes, but not as much as us.

1110
00:38:06,610 --> 00:38:08,650
We're going all-in this time.

1111
00:38:08,650 --> 00:38:09,780
How about this, Jong Kook?

1112
00:38:09,880 --> 00:38:12,530
Let's not bid a single dollar...

1113
00:38:12,530 --> 00:38:13,990
and bet our chances
on the final round.

1114
00:38:13,990 --> 00:38:15,170
Or...

1115
00:38:15,170 --> 00:38:17,170
- That sounds like a good plan.
- If you think about it...

1116
00:38:17,170 --> 00:38:18,260
So then...

1117
00:38:18,260 --> 00:38:20,800
They could skip this round
and let us win this time.

1118
00:38:20,800 --> 00:38:23,130
It'd be stupid for us
to bid a lot in this round.

1119
00:38:23,170 --> 00:38:24,510
We need to read their minds.

1120
00:38:24,710 --> 00:38:26,170
They might not choose this round.

1121
00:38:26,170 --> 00:38:28,050
They might skip this round.

1122
00:38:28,150 --> 00:38:30,670
We have to choose
either this round...

1123
00:38:30,710 --> 00:38:32,240
or the final round.

1124
00:38:32,240 --> 00:38:33,820
(They have to choose either
this round or the final round.)

1125
00:38:33,990 --> 00:38:35,240
Let's go.

1126
00:38:35,240 --> 00:38:36,280
What are we going to do?

1127
00:38:36,280 --> 00:38:37,920
Let's decide after they make a bid.

1128
00:38:37,920 --> 00:38:39,190
Let's see what they do.

1129
00:38:39,190 --> 00:38:41,280
(What will the two teams do?)

1130
00:38:41,460 --> 00:38:42,460
Let's start.

1131
00:38:43,030 --> 00:38:44,090
- Okay.
- Okay.

1132
00:38:45,190 --> 00:38:46,190
Let's win this.

1133
00:38:46,260 --> 00:38:47,360
It's our last chance.

1134
00:38:47,360 --> 00:38:48,460
This might be our last chance.

1135
00:38:49,460 --> 00:38:52,490
(All-in or 0 dollars)

1136
00:38:52,490 --> 00:38:56,110
(What did Team Hae Sun
decide to do?)

1137
00:38:58,070 --> 00:39:00,480
(All of the members bid 0 dollars.)

1138
00:39:00,900 --> 00:39:02,980
Why are we taking the risk...

1139
00:39:02,980 --> 00:39:04,610
of waiting until the final round
though?

1140
00:39:04,670 --> 00:39:06,340
It might be a good idea
to bid nothing in this round.

1141
00:39:06,340 --> 00:39:08,010
The ones who have been bidding
in every round...

1142
00:39:08,210 --> 00:39:11,010
Even if they don't bid
in this round,

1143
00:39:11,010 --> 00:39:13,260
- They can't win anyway.
- they know they can't win anyway,

1144
00:39:13,320 --> 00:39:14,320
so they'll definitely make a bid.

1145
00:39:14,320 --> 00:39:16,780
(If the other team bids a large
amount, they'll automatically win.)

1146
00:39:17,630 --> 00:39:18,820
Chil Deuk.

1147
00:39:18,820 --> 00:39:20,820
This might be our last chance.
Why...

1148
00:39:20,820 --> 00:39:22,630
- Chil Deuk.
- There's no point in saving money.

1149
00:39:22,730 --> 00:39:24,460
- Chil Deuk.
- We can't keep it anyway.

1150
00:39:25,300 --> 00:39:26,400
Chil Deuk.

1151
00:39:27,760 --> 00:39:33,010
(Will Team Hae Sun's
0-dollar strategy pay off?)

1152
00:39:34,570 --> 00:39:37,150
Kwang Soo, it all depends on you.

1153
00:39:37,150 --> 00:39:38,820
(Fall for it.)

1154
00:39:39,820 --> 00:39:41,740
Kwang Soo, it all depends on you.

1155
00:39:41,940 --> 00:39:42,940
Please, Kwang Soo.

1156
00:39:42,940 --> 00:39:45,110
(Fall for it.)

1157
00:39:46,090 --> 00:39:47,090
Please, Kwang Soo.

1158
00:39:47,490 --> 00:39:50,090
Se Chan doesn't sound confident.

1159
00:39:50,090 --> 00:39:52,860
(Fall for it.)

1160
00:39:52,860 --> 00:39:55,760
- Why would he say "please"?
- He said "please."

1161
00:39:55,760 --> 00:39:57,170
He doesn't sound confident.

1162
00:39:57,230 --> 00:39:59,300
(Please fall for it.)

1163
00:40:02,360 --> 00:40:04,130
- Give us a second.
- Come here.

1164
00:40:04,340 --> 00:40:05,840
Why did he say "please"?

1165
00:40:05,900 --> 00:40:08,670
- This is not fair.
- Just a second.

1166
00:40:09,170 --> 00:40:11,820
- This might be our last round.
- There are two possibilities.

1167
00:40:12,820 --> 00:40:14,990
- I think they fell for it.
- I think so.

1168
00:40:15,090 --> 00:40:16,490
They fell for your reaction.

1169
00:40:16,690 --> 00:40:18,190
If they made a bid
without any tricks...

1170
00:40:18,190 --> 00:40:19,550
It seems they did, right?

1171
00:40:19,710 --> 00:40:21,090
It seems like
they didn't come up with any tricks.

1172
00:40:21,130 --> 00:40:23,230
They either found us out...

1173
00:40:23,230 --> 00:40:25,190
or fell for us.

1174
00:40:25,190 --> 00:40:26,400
That's why they're changing
their strategy.

1175
00:40:26,690 --> 00:40:27,860
Let's make a choice.

1176
00:40:27,860 --> 00:40:30,260
We either bid 27 dollars...

1177
00:40:30,670 --> 00:40:33,090
- or...
- About four dollars?

1178
00:40:33,090 --> 00:40:34,570
- Four dollars each?
- What if we lose?

1179
00:40:34,570 --> 00:40:36,630
- Then we'll definitely lose.
- No, in total.

1180
00:40:37,010 --> 00:40:38,170
I mean...

1181
00:40:38,170 --> 00:40:40,130
Then we'll be left with 26 dollars.

1182
00:40:40,510 --> 00:40:42,150
That's not what I meant.

1183
00:40:42,340 --> 00:40:44,170
We have to gamble now.

1184
00:40:44,170 --> 00:40:47,150
- They want us to bid a lot.
- Right.

1185
00:40:47,150 --> 00:40:48,240
(They can't come to an agreement.)

1186
00:40:48,240 --> 00:40:50,440
- I'm starving.
- They're so serious.

1187
00:40:50,820 --> 00:40:52,490
This is driving me crazy.

1188
00:40:53,190 --> 00:40:55,260
Make a bid one by one.
Make sure no one can see.

1189
00:40:55,260 --> 00:40:57,130
(Team Jong Ok makes a decision
after a long discussion.)

1190
00:40:59,760 --> 00:41:01,960
(What did Team Jong Ok
decide to do?)

1191
00:41:01,960 --> 00:41:03,360
This is giving me a headache.

1192
00:41:04,490 --> 00:41:08,630
(Are they bidding
27 dollars or 4 dollars?)

1193
00:41:08,940 --> 00:41:11,010
(Actor Lee Kwang Soo,
specialty: conveying emotions)

1194
00:41:11,010 --> 00:41:12,340
- All right.
- We have to gamble.

1195
00:41:12,340 --> 00:41:17,050
- The cake and coffee go to...
- Us, definitely.

1196
00:41:17,050 --> 00:41:18,280
Let's go!

1197
00:41:20,150 --> 00:41:21,820
- Go to...
- Let's go!

1198
00:41:24,260 --> 00:41:25,610
Congratulations, Team Jong Ok.

1199
00:41:25,610 --> 00:41:27,320
(Team Jong Ok wins.)

1200
00:41:28,690 --> 00:41:29,760
- How much did they bid?
- What happened?

1201
00:41:29,760 --> 00:41:31,320
Let me tell you the amount
each team bid.

1202
00:41:31,400 --> 00:41:32,530
For the cake...

1203
00:41:32,530 --> 00:41:33,590
(The amount is important.)

1204
00:41:33,990 --> 00:41:35,130
For the cake...

1205
00:41:36,800 --> 00:41:38,030
The two teams bid
25 dollars and 0 dollars.

1206
00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:40,130
- I told you.
- They bid 0 dollars.

1207
00:41:41,010 --> 00:41:42,400
- 25 dollars and 0 dollars.
- Okay!

1208
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:43,900
- Yes!
- We made a good call.

1209
00:41:43,900 --> 00:41:46,130
You didn't expect this, did you?

1210
00:41:46,130 --> 00:41:48,110
- I'm so happy.
- We can't play the next round...

1211
00:41:48,110 --> 00:41:49,440
because Team Jong Ok
doesn't have enough money.

1212
00:41:49,440 --> 00:41:51,240
As a result, Team Hae Sun wins.

1213
00:41:51,240 --> 00:41:52,280
(Team Hae Sun automatically wins.)

1214
00:41:52,280 --> 00:41:53,440
They had to gamble.

1215
00:41:53,440 --> 00:41:55,110
So this is why it's so fun.

1216
00:41:55,150 --> 00:41:57,320
We fell for "please".

1217
00:41:59,490 --> 00:42:01,820
- Let's bid a lot in this round.
- Let's do that.

1218
00:42:02,920 --> 00:42:04,490
Whether it works or not...

1219
00:42:04,490 --> 00:42:05,630
(We'll give it a try anyway.)

1220
00:42:05,630 --> 00:42:07,150
Let's bid 27 dollars.

1221
00:42:07,570 --> 00:42:09,130
- I'll bid all I have.
- Me too.

1222
00:42:09,800 --> 00:42:11,340
(They completely fell
for the other team.)

1223
00:42:11,340 --> 00:42:13,360
- "Please" is what made us fall.
- Who said it?

1224
00:42:14,070 --> 00:42:16,630
We fell for "please."

1225
00:42:16,630 --> 00:42:18,170
Anyway,

1226
00:42:19,030 --> 00:42:21,240
the pizza and coke set,
jjajangmyeon, and jjamppong...

1227
00:42:21,240 --> 00:42:22,840
go to Team Hae Sun.

1228
00:42:22,840 --> 00:42:25,070
(The final winner is Team Hae Sun.)

1229
00:42:25,070 --> 00:42:28,280
Meanwhile, one of us
bid two dollars less.

1230
00:42:28,320 --> 00:42:31,010
One member of the losing team
gets to eat with Team Jong Ok...

1231
00:42:31,090 --> 00:42:33,990
and pick a bag from the good zone.

1232
00:42:33,990 --> 00:42:35,130
- Who is it?
- Who is it?

1233
00:42:35,260 --> 00:42:37,360
- I bid it's So Min.
- No, I bid all I had.

1234
00:42:37,360 --> 00:42:39,150
(Who betrayed his or her teammates
and saved money?)

1235
00:42:39,150 --> 00:42:41,090
Congratulations, Haha.
He has four dollars left.

1236
00:42:41,090 --> 00:42:42,230
(Haha, with four dollars left,
is saved.)

1237
00:42:42,230 --> 00:42:43,230
See? It's not me.

1238
00:42:44,300 --> 00:42:45,960
(He is the one
who bid 2 dollars less.)

1239
00:42:45,960 --> 00:42:48,030
- See? It's not me.
- I knew it.

1240
00:42:48,670 --> 00:42:50,300
Hi, Chil Deuk.

1241
00:42:50,300 --> 00:42:51,800
(This man sitting on
Chil Deuk's lap...)

1242
00:42:52,110 --> 00:42:53,380
(had promised to bid 5 dollars...)

1243
00:42:53,380 --> 00:42:55,380
(but in the end bid only 3 dollars.)

1244
00:42:55,440 --> 00:42:56,940
(By saving his money,
he gets to sit on Chil Deuk's lap.)

1245
00:42:56,940 --> 00:42:58,820
It was our last round.

1246
00:42:58,940 --> 00:43:01,240
Suk Jin and Jong Ok
have a dollar left each.

1247
00:43:01,240 --> 00:43:02,650
Jae Suk and So Min
have no money left.

1248
00:43:02,650 --> 00:43:04,990
- I have nothing left.
- That's so cool.

1249
00:43:05,420 --> 00:43:07,320
Before we eat,

1250
00:43:07,320 --> 00:43:08,550
let's pick bags first.

1251
00:43:08,550 --> 00:43:09,820
(The second bag-picking)

1252
00:43:10,360 --> 00:43:11,920
(Team Hae Sun and Haha
pick from the good zone.)

1253
00:43:11,920 --> 00:43:13,400
This is the problem.

1254
00:43:13,650 --> 00:43:14,820
Our team won, right?

1255
00:43:16,400 --> 00:43:17,670
There are chances.

1256
00:43:18,670 --> 00:43:20,460
So you really didn't bid.

1257
00:43:20,900 --> 00:43:22,860
(He is just like
what he looks like on TV.)

1258
00:43:22,860 --> 00:43:24,740
That's not true.
In the last round...

1259
00:43:24,840 --> 00:43:28,800
He has 10 dollars left.
I didn't know you'd do that.

1260
00:43:28,800 --> 00:43:30,610
- Call him Chil Deuk once.
- I saved it for the last round.

1261
00:43:30,610 --> 00:43:31,940
Chil Deuk.

1262
00:43:31,940 --> 00:43:33,240
(Gosh, Chil Deuk.)

1263
00:43:35,320 --> 00:43:37,820
(Kwang Soo's official nickname
is now Chil Deuk.)

1264
00:43:37,820 --> 00:43:39,650
I'm sorry.

1265
00:43:39,650 --> 00:43:42,030
Jong Ok said to So Min,

1266
00:43:42,030 --> 00:43:45,360
"I'll slap you hard."

1267
00:43:45,630 --> 00:43:47,230
That made So Min come to her senses.

1268
00:43:47,230 --> 00:43:49,360
That's why I bid all I had.

1269
00:43:49,360 --> 00:43:51,630
For So Min to do that,
she must have been really scared.

1270
00:43:51,630 --> 00:43:52,760
(Even So Min bid all she had.)

1271
00:43:52,760 --> 00:43:54,240
So Min bid all she had.

1272
00:43:54,240 --> 00:43:57,880
- Team Hae Sun, please pick bags.
- This is not good.

1273
00:43:58,570 --> 00:44:00,300
Most of them are good ones.

1274
00:44:00,380 --> 00:44:01,510
Really?

1275
00:44:01,570 --> 00:44:03,070
- Bad ones...
- There aren't many bad ones.

1276
00:44:03,070 --> 00:44:04,710
There are some bad ones left,
but not many.

1277
00:44:04,710 --> 00:44:06,610
There are only six bad ones left.

1278
00:44:06,610 --> 00:44:08,240
I wish they'd pick all the bad ones.

1279
00:44:09,590 --> 00:44:12,110
(Hae Sun picks bag number 16.)

1280
00:44:12,610 --> 00:44:13,920
Okay.

1281
00:44:14,190 --> 00:44:16,730
I hope it's a really bad one.

1282
00:44:18,460 --> 00:44:20,190
- Minus 100 dollars.
- Minus 200 dollars.

1283
00:44:20,650 --> 00:44:23,860
(Hae Sun is currently in 3rd place
with 70 dollars.)

1284
00:44:27,840 --> 00:44:29,110
- How much is it?
- Plus 50 dollars.

1285
00:44:29,340 --> 00:44:30,860
That's not bad.

1286
00:44:30,860 --> 00:44:32,010
(Plus 50 dollars)

1287
00:44:32,010 --> 00:44:33,530
Hae Sun is now in first place.

1288
00:44:34,400 --> 00:44:35,670
She has 120 dollars.

1289
00:44:36,480 --> 00:44:38,380
(The other members pick
plus values too.)

1290
00:44:38,380 --> 00:44:39,480
- Gosh.
- Plus 10 dollars.

1291
00:44:39,480 --> 00:44:41,240
- At least...
- It was close though.

1292
00:44:41,240 --> 00:44:42,490
I'm not at the bottom at least.

1293
00:44:42,490 --> 00:44:44,280
(It's Jong Kook's turn,
who is way behind the others.)

1294
00:44:44,550 --> 00:44:46,280
Wait, I have minus 150 dollars.

1295
00:44:46,690 --> 00:44:48,260
How much do I have to get?

1296
00:44:48,260 --> 00:44:50,780
Jong Kook is most likely
to end up being at the bottom.

1297
00:44:51,050 --> 00:44:52,650
Probably.

1298
00:44:53,420 --> 00:44:56,030
Don't forget there are
a switch chance and a double chance.

1299
00:44:56,130 --> 00:44:57,260
There are?

1300
00:44:57,360 --> 00:44:58,490
If Jong Kook picks a double chance,

1301
00:44:58,490 --> 00:44:59,940
will Jong Kook be left with
minus 300 dollars?

1302
00:45:00,860 --> 00:45:02,340
- What?
- Minus...

1303
00:45:03,210 --> 00:45:04,380
I can't wait.

1304
00:45:04,670 --> 00:45:07,610
This number two left alone here
is bothering me.

1305
00:45:07,900 --> 00:45:09,880
You should pick
one of those lonely ones.

1306
00:45:10,300 --> 00:45:11,780
We, the unlucky ones, are like that.

1307
00:45:11,780 --> 00:45:13,420
- We don't want them to be lonely.
- Right?

1308
00:45:13,880 --> 00:45:15,090
You guys are too nice.

1309
00:45:15,380 --> 00:45:16,510
They're too nice?

1310
00:45:17,210 --> 00:45:18,710
I would have picked that one too.

1311
00:45:18,710 --> 00:45:20,590
- Really? Okay.
- Yes.

1312
00:45:20,860 --> 00:45:22,030
I trust you then.

1313
00:45:22,030 --> 00:45:23,920
(Jong Kook, who is at the bottom,
recklessly trusts Jae Suk.)

1314
00:45:23,920 --> 00:45:26,550
(What will be the result?)

1315
00:45:28,490 --> 00:45:29,900
(What?)

1316
00:45:29,900 --> 00:45:31,990
(Only a dollar?)

1317
00:45:32,240 --> 00:45:34,170
(Jong Kook,
who has minus 150 dollars,)

1318
00:45:34,170 --> 00:45:36,360
(miraculously wins a dollar.)

1319
00:45:37,070 --> 00:45:39,300
You have minus 149 dollars now.

1320
00:45:39,380 --> 00:45:41,240
Unlucky ones don't want anything
to be lonely.

1321
00:45:41,240 --> 00:45:43,550
I somehow feel so relieved now.

1322
00:45:43,550 --> 00:45:44,780
Right?

1323
00:45:44,780 --> 00:45:46,650
I feel so relieved.

1324
00:45:46,650 --> 00:45:49,050
(With an additional dollar,
he starts chasing the others.)

1325
00:45:49,550 --> 00:45:51,210
I hope Kwang Soo gets
minus 200 dollars.

1326
00:45:52,010 --> 00:45:53,260
I pick bag number 12.

1327
00:45:53,780 --> 00:45:55,230
- Bag number 12.
- No, bag number 5.

1328
00:45:56,150 --> 00:45:57,420
No, I'll choose bag number 12.

1329
00:45:57,420 --> 00:45:58,590
Bag number 12.

1330
00:45:59,320 --> 00:46:00,900
It's been bothering me
the whole time.

1331
00:46:00,900 --> 00:46:03,420
- I want him to get a minus value.
- A big minus.

1332
00:46:03,420 --> 00:46:04,670
- Here we go.
- Red letters, please.

1333
00:46:04,670 --> 00:46:06,340
Let's go!

1334
00:46:06,340 --> 00:46:09,800
(There are only 6 minus values left
out of 21.)

1335
00:46:09,800 --> 00:46:11,740
(What's the result?)

1336
00:46:12,980 --> 00:46:15,650
(Minus 70 dollars)

1337
00:46:15,650 --> 00:46:16,840
- He's wearing a red cap too.
- Let's go!

1338
00:46:21,010 --> 00:46:22,820
(She's laughing for real.)

1339
00:46:22,820 --> 00:46:24,010
Jong Ok looks genuinely happy.

1340
00:46:24,010 --> 00:46:25,690
(Our Kwang Soo is back.)

1341
00:46:25,690 --> 00:46:27,780
Chil Deuk picked minus 70 dollars
because "Chil" means 7.

1342
00:46:27,780 --> 00:46:29,030
He sure is Chil Deuk.

1343
00:46:29,130 --> 00:46:30,960
- Chil Deuk.
- It was for my team.

1344
00:46:30,960 --> 00:46:33,230
Chil Deuk picked minus 70 dollars.

1345
00:46:33,420 --> 00:46:34,820
(The other team picks
from the bad zone.)

1346
00:46:34,820 --> 00:46:36,190
Minus 50 dollars.

1347
00:46:36,730 --> 00:46:37,990
- That's not bad.
- Minus 30 dollars.

1348
00:46:37,990 --> 00:46:39,090
That's not too bad.

1349
00:46:39,090 --> 00:46:40,590
I was going to pick this one,

1350
00:46:40,840 --> 00:46:42,030
but the other team
recommended this one.

1351
00:46:42,510 --> 00:46:44,210
It's a double chance.

1352
00:46:44,610 --> 00:46:46,670
- You have 60 dollars now.
- I have 60 dollars now.

1353
00:46:46,670 --> 00:46:48,070
(He has 30 dollars times 2 now.)

1354
00:46:48,070 --> 00:46:49,150
The letters are blue.

1355
00:46:49,210 --> 00:46:50,840
In this situation?

1356
00:46:50,940 --> 00:46:52,010
In this situation...

1357
00:46:52,010 --> 00:46:53,610
(Jong Ok picks plus 30 dollars.)

1358
00:46:53,610 --> 00:46:56,010
Hae Sun is in 1st place, and Jong Ok
is in 2nd, only 10 dollars apart.

1359
00:46:56,210 --> 00:47:01,190
(Current Amount)

1360
00:47:01,380 --> 00:47:02,650
Thank you for the food.

1361
00:47:03,730 --> 00:47:05,630
- Is the pizza warm?
- Yes.

1362
00:47:05,630 --> 00:47:06,920
(They enjoy pizza
after the exciting mind game.)

1363
00:47:06,920 --> 00:47:10,360
Who's that guy wearing
his jacket inside out?

1364
00:47:10,360 --> 00:47:12,240
(Perfectly camouflaged)

1365
00:47:12,440 --> 00:47:14,240
I can't believe Haha.

1366
00:47:14,240 --> 00:47:15,610
- I know.
- He's sitting with the other team.

1367
00:47:17,440 --> 00:47:19,900
It feels like I'm eating sand.
I feel so uncomfortable.

1368
00:47:21,480 --> 00:47:23,510
By the way, his jjajangmyeon...

1369
00:47:23,510 --> 00:47:26,570
- doesn't look good.
- I know.

1370
00:47:26,570 --> 00:47:29,090
(His jjajangmyeon tastes like sand.)

1371
00:47:29,650 --> 00:47:32,090
Jong Ok, you say such mean words.

1372
00:47:32,550 --> 00:47:34,320
The noodles look all soggy.

1373
00:47:34,490 --> 00:47:37,090
She's glaring at us the whole time.

1374
00:47:37,420 --> 00:47:40,760
Why do you keep looking
at the other team?

1375
00:47:40,760 --> 00:47:42,090
I just took a look.

1376
00:47:42,090 --> 00:47:44,130
Our food is so simple.

1377
00:47:44,130 --> 00:47:46,860
I'd share the food with you,
but it's against the rules.

1378
00:47:47,530 --> 00:47:49,340
I'd give all of it to her.

1379
00:47:50,030 --> 00:47:51,240
You're lying.

1380
00:47:52,340 --> 00:47:53,610
The noodles actually are soggy.

1381
00:47:54,010 --> 00:47:55,710
- I told you. I can see it.
- Right.

1382
00:47:55,710 --> 00:47:58,780
(Kwang Soo takes a sip of coke.)

1383
00:48:01,210 --> 00:48:02,940
(Spitting)

1384
00:48:03,490 --> 00:48:04,760
- What's wrong?
- What's going on?

1385
00:48:04,760 --> 00:48:05,820
(What happened?)

1386
00:48:05,820 --> 00:48:07,780
Did you drink coke
with ice cream in your mouth?

1387
00:48:07,880 --> 00:48:08,990
Hey.

1388
00:48:09,280 --> 00:48:10,320
(The combination of
carbon dioxide and ice cream)

1389
00:48:10,320 --> 00:48:11,630
- What's with him?
- What happened?

1390
00:48:11,900 --> 00:48:14,630
If you drink coke
with ice cream in your mouth...

1391
00:48:14,960 --> 00:48:16,130
He's so stupid.

1392
00:48:16,230 --> 00:48:17,420
He deserves to be called Chil Deuk.

1393
00:48:17,420 --> 00:48:18,990
He really is Chil Deuk.

1394
00:48:18,990 --> 00:48:20,900
They even handled it
on "Curious Paradise."

1395
00:48:20,900 --> 00:48:22,170
Why did he drink the coke?

1396
00:48:22,170 --> 00:48:23,460
(Children and immature adults,
don't try this at home.)

1397
00:48:24,670 --> 00:48:27,480
The final mission will be
an individual game,

1398
00:48:27,480 --> 00:48:30,240
Mafia War: The Innocent Ones.

1399
00:48:31,110 --> 00:48:33,920
A team of five will play
the Mafia Game.

1400
00:48:33,920 --> 00:48:35,420
After all the members draw
a cue card,

1401
00:48:35,420 --> 00:48:37,420
one member will be chosen
as the mafia at random.

1402
00:48:37,420 --> 00:48:38,920
The mafia's cue card has...

1403
00:48:39,010 --> 00:48:42,380
a mission word he or she must say.

1404
00:48:42,380 --> 00:48:44,690
- This is hard.
- I am good at a game like this.

1405
00:48:46,460 --> 00:48:47,630
- Really?
- He is getting revved up.

1406
00:48:47,630 --> 00:48:49,800
- He is the king of ad-libs.
- He is good.

1407
00:48:49,800 --> 00:48:51,340
Weren't you channeling
a dead frog earlier?

1408
00:48:52,190 --> 00:48:53,240
I am good at a game like this.

1409
00:48:53,240 --> 00:48:54,840
Don't call him a frog.
That's my nickname.

1410
00:48:54,840 --> 00:48:56,570
For 20 minutes,

1411
00:48:56,570 --> 00:48:59,010
talk among yourselves.

1412
00:48:59,010 --> 00:49:00,510
What do we need to talk about?

1413
00:49:00,510 --> 00:49:03,010
You can share a funny story
or an aspiration.

1414
00:49:03,010 --> 00:49:04,150
You just need to talk...

1415
00:49:04,150 --> 00:49:05,920
- comfortably.
- Can we talk about a dream?

1416
00:49:05,920 --> 00:49:08,210
Yes, you can.
You just need to talk comfortably.

1417
00:49:08,210 --> 00:49:10,920
However, the mafia must use...

1418
00:49:10,920 --> 00:49:12,420
his or her mission word.

1419
00:49:12,990 --> 00:49:16,360
The failure to use the mission word
will result in the mafia's loss.

1420
00:49:16,360 --> 00:49:17,920
After the talk,

1421
00:49:18,130 --> 00:49:20,530
you will discuss among yourselves
and decide who the mafia is.

1422
00:49:20,530 --> 00:49:22,300
If you succeed to catch the mafia,
the citizens win.

1423
00:49:22,300 --> 00:49:24,460
Otherwise, the mafia wins.

1424
00:49:24,460 --> 00:49:26,840
Please don't pretend to be
the mafia.

1425
00:49:26,840 --> 00:49:28,340
Can I pretend to be the mafia?

1426
00:49:28,340 --> 00:49:29,510
Please don't do that.

1427
00:49:29,510 --> 00:49:31,630
But I seek attention.

1428
00:49:31,630 --> 00:49:33,030
(He is honest.)

1429
00:49:33,030 --> 00:49:34,340
(He loves screen time
and attention.)

1430
00:49:34,340 --> 00:49:35,980
- He loves screen time.
- In summary,

1431
00:49:35,980 --> 00:49:38,150
we need to prove our innocence.

1432
00:49:38,150 --> 00:49:39,380
- My goodness.
- Right?

1433
00:49:39,380 --> 00:49:41,510
If the mafia says
the mission word...

1434
00:49:41,510 --> 00:49:43,590
in response
to someone else's words,

1435
00:49:43,590 --> 00:49:44,650
- does it count?
- Yes.

1436
00:49:44,650 --> 00:49:46,510
You will play the game
as a team of five.

1437
00:49:46,510 --> 00:49:48,260
- A team of 5.
- A team of 5.

1438
00:49:48,260 --> 00:49:49,530
- There are 5 of us.
- A team of 5.

1439
00:49:49,530 --> 00:49:50,990
- Will the five of us play the game?
- Yes.

1440
00:49:50,990 --> 00:49:53,260
We will play the Mafia Game
by ourselves.

1441
00:49:53,260 --> 00:49:55,400
You should go first.

1442
00:49:55,400 --> 00:49:57,030
Why? Why should we go first?

1443
00:49:57,030 --> 00:49:58,170
- Can't you do it?
- What?

1444
00:49:58,170 --> 00:49:59,530
Can't you listen to an older member?

1445
00:49:59,530 --> 00:50:00,960
- No.
- No?

1446
00:50:00,960 --> 00:50:02,300
- Jong Kook.
- That's just unfair.

1447
00:50:02,300 --> 00:50:04,110
- I will teach you a lesson one day.
- Jong Kook.

1448
00:50:04,110 --> 00:50:06,280
I have watched their interactions
for the past few weeks.

1449
00:50:06,400 --> 00:50:08,840
Nothing ever goes Suk Jin's way.

1450
00:50:09,670 --> 00:50:12,050
- Nothing.
- Listen.

1451
00:50:12,050 --> 00:50:13,510
- In 2020,
- Okay.

1452
00:50:13,510 --> 00:50:15,190
I will teach you a lesson.

1453
00:50:15,190 --> 00:50:17,650
Please teach me a lesson.

1454
00:50:17,650 --> 00:50:19,860
I don't like to second-guess.

1455
00:50:19,860 --> 00:50:21,320
The mafia will be chosen at random.

1456
00:50:21,320 --> 00:50:24,460
The mafia's cue card will have
a mission word.

1457
00:50:25,650 --> 00:50:27,900
Don't show your cue card
to the others.

1458
00:50:27,920 --> 00:50:30,420
The citizens can talk comfortably.

1459
00:50:30,420 --> 00:50:32,960
The mafia must incorporate
his or her mission word...

1460
00:50:32,960 --> 00:50:35,960
into the reaction
or the overall conversation.

1461
00:50:35,960 --> 00:50:38,030
If the word is too outrageous...

1462
00:50:38,030 --> 00:50:39,070
That's right.
Then it will be obvious.

1463
00:50:39,070 --> 00:50:40,280
Let's start the conversation.

1464
00:50:40,280 --> 00:50:41,400
Where do we begin?

1465
00:50:41,400 --> 00:50:44,670
Se Chan, you can share
your first impression of Hae Sun.

1466
00:50:44,670 --> 00:50:47,510
I made a mistake earlier.

1467
00:50:47,510 --> 00:50:49,490
- I didn't know your age.
- That's right.

1468
00:50:49,740 --> 00:50:52,610
I thought you were older than me.
I am so sorry.

1469
00:50:52,610 --> 00:50:54,150
- I thought you were older than me.
- It's okay.

1470
00:50:54,150 --> 00:50:55,650
She doesn't look older than you.

1471
00:50:55,650 --> 00:50:57,460
I got confused...

1472
00:50:57,460 --> 00:50:59,690
because she was much taller
than I expected.

1473
00:50:59,690 --> 00:51:01,130
- She is tall.
- Hae Sun is tall.

1474
00:51:01,130 --> 00:51:02,260
- She is 174cm tall.
- That's right.

1475
00:51:02,260 --> 00:51:04,230
Height has nothing to do with age.

1476
00:51:04,230 --> 00:51:06,170
- Since I was looking up at her,
- Are you an elementary schooler?

1477
00:51:06,170 --> 00:51:08,130
she seemed older.

1478
00:51:08,130 --> 00:51:10,210
Does that make Jang Do Yeon
as old as your mother?

1479
00:51:10,210 --> 00:51:12,110
(What kind of logic is that?)

1480
00:51:13,070 --> 00:51:14,900
(Godmother Jang Do Yeon)

1481
00:51:14,900 --> 00:51:17,440
You should call Kwang Soo "Grandpa."

1482
00:51:17,440 --> 00:51:18,550
That's ridiculous.

1483
00:51:18,550 --> 00:51:19,980
You should treat me
as an older member.

1484
00:51:19,980 --> 00:51:22,010
Kwang Soo has an old man's butt.

1485
00:51:22,010 --> 00:51:23,190
Hey!

1486
00:51:23,840 --> 00:51:26,050
(Kwang Soo has an old man's butt.)

1487
00:51:26,050 --> 00:51:27,610
- It's true.
- What are you talking about?

1488
00:51:27,610 --> 00:51:29,030
- It's true.
- I don't have an old man's butt.

1489
00:51:29,030 --> 00:51:30,420
Didn't you watch
"Tazza: One-Eyed Jacks"?

1490
00:51:30,420 --> 00:51:31,420
Make sure you do.

1491
00:51:31,420 --> 00:51:33,490
- He is like Dooly's grandpa.
- His butt makes an appearance.

1492
00:51:33,490 --> 00:51:34,900
- Dooly's grandpa!
- "Tazza: One-Eyed Jacks"?

1493
00:51:34,990 --> 00:51:36,170
"Tazza: One-Eyed Jacks".

1494
00:51:36,170 --> 00:51:38,090
"Butt" can't be the mission word,
right?

1495
00:51:38,090 --> 00:51:39,530
- "Butt."
- It could be "Butt."

1496
00:51:39,530 --> 00:51:41,710
No, no.
That came up pretty naturally.

1497
00:51:41,710 --> 00:51:44,110
If you have a story,

1498
00:51:44,110 --> 00:51:46,630
you should share it with us.

1499
00:51:46,630 --> 00:51:49,010
I want to talk about
the dream I had the other day.

1500
00:51:49,010 --> 00:51:50,880
- That's good.
- That's suspicious. Okay.

1501
00:51:50,880 --> 00:51:53,320
- I really had this dream.
- A dream is the perfect starter...

1502
00:51:53,320 --> 00:51:55,820
for any word because
they're outrageous.

1503
00:51:55,820 --> 00:51:56,820
- They are imaginary.
- That's right.

1504
00:51:56,820 --> 00:51:58,780
In the dream, Se Chan and I went...

1505
00:51:58,780 --> 00:52:00,490
to Lee Da Hee's house.

1506
00:52:00,490 --> 00:52:01,820
This is quite sudden.

1507
00:52:01,920 --> 00:52:03,260
- Da Hee.
- Keep going.

1508
00:52:03,260 --> 00:52:05,360
- Da Hee.
- Okay. Da Hee.

1509
00:52:05,360 --> 00:52:06,630
In the parking lot...

1510
00:52:18,900 --> 00:52:19,930
we were washing the car.

1511
00:52:19,930 --> 00:52:21,470
- "Washing the car"?
- "Washing the car"?

1512
00:52:21,840 --> 00:52:23,530
"Washing the car" is suspicious.

1513
00:52:23,530 --> 00:52:24,680
I am serious.

1514
00:52:24,680 --> 00:52:26,240
- We were washing the car.
- "Washing the car"?

1515
00:52:26,240 --> 00:52:30,340
- "Washing the car" is suspicious.
- You know what a BB gun is, right?

1516
00:52:30,420 --> 00:52:34,010
Someone stayed hidden
in the forest...

1517
00:52:34,550 --> 00:52:35,720
and shot at the two of us.

1518
00:52:35,720 --> 00:52:37,050
- At us?
- Yes.

1519
00:52:37,110 --> 00:52:39,510
Let's keep listening.
Let's see how the story ends.

1520
00:52:39,760 --> 00:52:41,780
Se Chan ran away first.

1521
00:52:41,780 --> 00:52:43,950
I was packing up...

1522
00:52:43,950 --> 00:52:46,400
when the shooter approached me...

1523
00:52:46,400 --> 00:52:48,860
and pushed my cap down.

1524
00:52:48,860 --> 00:52:49,970
"Cap."

1525
00:52:49,970 --> 00:52:53,970
Then the shooter tapped on my head.

1526
00:52:54,010 --> 00:52:56,030
When I woke up,

1527
00:52:56,280 --> 00:52:58,880
I felt the tap on my back.

1528
00:52:58,880 --> 00:53:00,240
- You felt it when you woke up.
- Yes.

1529
00:53:00,240 --> 00:53:02,610
(When he woke up,
he felt the tap on his back.)

1530
00:53:03,380 --> 00:53:04,740
- This happened for real.
- My goodness.

1531
00:53:04,740 --> 00:53:07,090
I was so startled
that I started sweating profusely.

1532
00:53:07,090 --> 00:53:08,840
And when I looked back,
no one was there.

1533
00:53:09,180 --> 00:53:10,260
What?

1534
00:53:10,260 --> 00:53:11,950
- His story...
- It's suspicious.

1535
00:53:11,950 --> 00:53:14,630
- It can't be a story he prepared.
- "BB gun" must be the word.

1536
00:53:14,630 --> 00:53:16,130
- "BB gun."
- "BB gun."

1537
00:53:16,130 --> 00:53:17,590
- I really had that dream.
- Hey.

1538
00:53:17,590 --> 00:53:19,260
- I told you about the dream.
- He did,

1539
00:53:19,260 --> 00:53:20,800
but he didn't talk about
the parking lot.

1540
00:53:20,800 --> 00:53:23,470
Kwang Soo told me about the dream,
but...

1541
00:53:23,470 --> 00:53:24,530
- I told you the story the same.
- No.

1542
00:53:24,530 --> 00:53:26,610
There were a few words
he didn't mention before.

1543
00:53:26,610 --> 00:53:28,130
He said BB gun before,

1544
00:53:28,170 --> 00:53:31,110
but Se Chan, Da Hee,
and washing the car didn't.

1545
00:53:31,110 --> 00:53:32,240
Those three words were missing.

1546
00:53:32,240 --> 00:53:33,340
Here is what I think.

1547
00:53:33,340 --> 00:53:35,880
He intentionally retold the story
you have heard.

1548
00:53:35,880 --> 00:53:37,510
- The parking lot.
- This is driving me crazy.

1549
00:53:37,510 --> 00:53:38,970
I am a citizen.

1550
00:53:38,970 --> 00:53:40,280
"Washing the car" must be
his mission word.

1551
00:53:40,280 --> 00:53:42,090
He only mentioned
the underground parking lot before.

1552
00:53:42,150 --> 00:53:44,090
I told the story before.

1553
00:53:44,090 --> 00:53:45,320
I told the story
to Se Chan and So Min before.

1554
00:53:45,320 --> 00:53:46,590
Ji Hyo is awfully quiet.

1555
00:53:46,590 --> 00:53:49,630
I was thinking about a dream I had.

1556
00:53:49,630 --> 00:53:50,630
Tell us about it.

1557
00:53:50,630 --> 00:53:51,990
I was having
a shoot for Running Man.

1558
00:53:52,630 --> 00:53:55,090
In the dream, we had the Speed Quiz.

1559
00:53:55,090 --> 00:53:58,070
"Talk about four-character idioms.
Talk about mathematical functions."

1560
00:53:58,130 --> 00:54:00,610
- Mathematical functions!
- I was so lost.

1561
00:54:01,470 --> 00:54:02,800
- This happened in a dream, right?
- So...

1562
00:54:02,900 --> 00:54:06,510
I suffered so much
due to four-character idioms...

1563
00:54:06,610 --> 00:54:07,950
that I downloaded an app.

1564
00:54:07,950 --> 00:54:09,110
- You downloaded an app.
- That's right.

1565
00:54:09,110 --> 00:54:10,820
- This happened in a dream, right?
- I see.

1566
00:54:10,820 --> 00:54:13,010
The wallpaper
of Ji Hyo's phone is...

1567
00:54:13,010 --> 00:54:14,650
- January, February...
- Yes.

1568
00:54:14,680 --> 00:54:16,420
It has all the months in English.

1569
00:54:16,420 --> 00:54:19,490
So I began to study
four-character idioms.

1570
00:54:19,610 --> 00:54:21,630
Why don't you give us one?

1571
00:54:22,180 --> 00:54:23,450
Well...

1572
00:54:25,360 --> 00:54:26,470
Gyeolchoboeun.

1573
00:54:26,470 --> 00:54:27,530
(She confidently says
a four-character idiom.)

1574
00:54:27,530 --> 00:54:28,970
What does "Gyeolchoboeun" mean?

1575
00:54:28,970 --> 00:54:30,300
(What does "Gyeolchoboeun" mean?)

1576
00:54:31,470 --> 00:54:33,030
- I can't believe her.
- My goodness.

1577
00:54:33,030 --> 00:54:36,010
- You should know the meaning.
- She dug her own grave.

1578
00:54:36,010 --> 00:54:39,070
When you memorize
four-character idioms,

1579
00:54:39,070 --> 00:54:41,510
- you should know the meaning.
- You should know...

1580
00:54:41,510 --> 00:54:43,970
- what the characters mean.
- There are easier ones.

1581
00:54:43,970 --> 00:54:46,510
Ji Hyo, exactly how do you study?

1582
00:54:47,180 --> 00:54:48,510
You should know the meaning.

1583
00:54:48,650 --> 00:54:51,720
Nothing was suspicious
about Ji Hyo's story.

1584
00:54:51,720 --> 00:54:53,380
I think "Four-character idiom"
is suspicious.

1585
00:54:53,380 --> 00:54:54,760
- "Four-character idiom."
- Suddenly...

1586
00:54:54,860 --> 00:54:56,630
- Hold on.
- Her story was flawless.

1587
00:54:56,630 --> 00:54:57,950
- It's suspicious.
- You know,

1588
00:54:57,990 --> 00:55:00,630
I don't think the real mafia made
an attempt yet.

1589
00:55:00,630 --> 00:55:02,170
- I agree.
- I think Jong Kook is the mafia.

1590
00:55:02,220 --> 00:55:04,300
- Jong Kook hasn't said anything.
- He never makes the first move.

1591
00:55:04,300 --> 00:55:06,470
- Jong Kook...
- I will share...

1592
00:55:06,470 --> 00:55:09,700
something ridiculous
that happened in my life.

1593
00:55:09,700 --> 00:55:12,780
One time, I went to a swimming pool
with Haha and Kwang Soo.

1594
00:55:12,800 --> 00:55:15,650
- "A swimming pool."
- We went to a swimming pool.

1595
00:55:15,780 --> 00:55:17,820
That day,

1596
00:55:17,920 --> 00:55:21,590
we were talking about
how we should meet someone...

1597
00:55:21,590 --> 00:55:23,720
- and get married.
- He is telling that story again.

1598
00:55:23,990 --> 00:55:25,320
Suddenly, Haha said,

1599
00:55:25,320 --> 00:55:27,380
"Why don't we have lunch together?"

1600
00:55:27,380 --> 00:55:30,200
- "It's my father's 80th birthday."
- 70th birthday.

1601
00:55:30,200 --> 00:55:32,260
"It's my father's 80th birthday."
I said, "Okay, let's go."

1602
00:55:32,530 --> 00:55:33,860
I went with him.

1603
00:55:34,130 --> 00:55:36,170
At a round table,

1604
00:55:36,170 --> 00:55:38,070
I didn't see his father,

1605
00:55:38,360 --> 00:55:41,530
but Byul and Jae Suk.

1606
00:55:41,610 --> 00:55:42,800
I thought,
"What is Byul doing here?"

1607
00:55:42,800 --> 00:55:44,610
I was going through the same thing.

1608
00:55:44,740 --> 00:55:46,240
"What is Byul doing here?"

1609
00:55:46,240 --> 00:55:49,010
I sat down. Then, Haha...

1610
00:55:49,010 --> 00:55:52,240
who shared my worries about
marriage and such a moment ago...

1611
00:55:52,240 --> 00:55:53,320
suddenly said,

1612
00:55:53,320 --> 00:55:54,680
"Jong Kook, I am getting married."

1613
00:55:54,680 --> 00:55:55,840
(Haha said that to Jong Kook.)

1614
00:55:55,840 --> 00:55:57,280
- What a shocking statement!
- You must have been flustered.

1615
00:55:57,720 --> 00:55:59,680
He suddenly said...

1616
00:55:59,680 --> 00:56:01,360
- that he will marry...
- Jong Kook is ridiculous.

1617
00:56:01,360 --> 00:56:03,950
Byul, who I don't know.

1618
00:56:03,950 --> 00:56:06,090
- You know,
- Isn't it ridiculous?

1619
00:56:06,090 --> 00:56:07,760
that happened eight years ago.
Are you still holding grudges?

1620
00:56:08,590 --> 00:56:10,030
- Seriously.
- I was so flustered.

1621
00:56:10,030 --> 00:56:11,490
- Do you know what he said to me?
- Listen.

1622
00:56:11,490 --> 00:56:12,900
"When I get married,"

1623
00:56:12,900 --> 00:56:16,300
"you will find out through the news
on a search engine."

1624
00:56:16,300 --> 00:56:18,610
I will make sure he finds out
through the news.

1625
00:56:18,610 --> 00:56:19,610
Jong Kook is dead serious.

1626
00:56:19,610 --> 00:56:20,950
- You know,
- Isn't it ridiculous?

1627
00:56:20,950 --> 00:56:22,780
- it was ridiculous.
- It was indeed.

1628
00:56:22,780 --> 00:56:24,180
We found out at
his father's 70th birthday party.

1629
00:56:24,180 --> 00:56:25,720
You saw something that was
even more ridiculous...

1630
00:56:25,720 --> 00:56:27,090
than how I broke the news.

1631
00:56:27,090 --> 00:56:29,950
My father didn't attend
his 70th birthday party.

1632
00:56:30,780 --> 00:56:32,510
(His father didn't attend
his 70th birthday party.)

1633
00:56:32,510 --> 00:56:34,180
- That's true.
- Seriously.

1634
00:56:34,180 --> 00:56:35,780
- Seriously.
- He didn't come.

1635
00:56:35,780 --> 00:56:38,300
It was one ridiculous thing
after another.

1636
00:56:38,300 --> 00:56:39,970
"Father, where are you?"

1637
00:56:40,070 --> 00:56:41,320
"The traffic is heavy."

1638
00:56:41,320 --> 00:56:43,030
"What?"
"I won't go. The traffic is heavy."

1639
00:56:43,030 --> 00:56:44,090
"I won't go."

1640
00:56:44,200 --> 00:56:45,590
- He really didn't show up?
- No.

1641
00:56:45,590 --> 00:56:46,630
He is a free-spirited man.

1642
00:56:46,630 --> 00:56:47,840
Then did his 70th birthday party
get canceled?

1643
00:56:47,840 --> 00:56:50,380
We photoshopped him
on an empty chair later.

1644
00:56:50,840 --> 00:56:51,930
We had it by ourselves.

1645
00:56:51,930 --> 00:56:54,510
What's more ridiculous is that
Jae Suk picked up the bill.

1646
00:56:55,200 --> 00:56:56,200
What?

1647
00:56:56,200 --> 00:56:57,450
- You paid the bill?
- Yes.

1648
00:56:57,450 --> 00:56:59,570
- Why?
- Jae Suk picked up the bill.

1649
00:56:59,570 --> 00:57:01,050
Why did you do that?

1650
00:57:01,110 --> 00:57:04,050
It's because I announced my wedding
without doing my father's party.

1651
00:57:04,050 --> 00:57:05,490
That makes sense.

1652
00:57:05,490 --> 00:57:07,450
Se Chan, you should talk too.

1653
00:57:07,450 --> 00:57:09,550
I will talk about the time...

1654
00:57:09,590 --> 00:57:10,950
- I got flustered.
- Go ahead.

1655
00:57:10,950 --> 00:57:13,130
I recently got a medical checkup.

1656
00:57:13,360 --> 00:57:14,820
You said you will get it with me.
I can't believe it.

1657
00:57:14,820 --> 00:57:16,900
I haven't gotten it yet!

1658
00:57:16,900 --> 00:57:17,970
(You said you will get it with me.
I can't believe it.)

1659
00:57:17,970 --> 00:57:20,300
(Se Chan's betrayal annoys
Jong Kook.)

1660
00:57:20,430 --> 00:57:22,130
- Se Chan betrayed him.
- You said you will get it with me.

1661
00:57:22,130 --> 00:57:23,900
- I haven't gotten it yet!
- You said you will get it with me.

1662
00:57:23,900 --> 00:57:25,470
- It actually happened in the past.
- For goodness' sake.

1663
00:57:26,300 --> 00:57:29,110
Why would you get
a medical checkup together?

1664
00:57:29,110 --> 00:57:30,840
I thought we were friends.

1665
00:57:30,840 --> 00:57:33,320
- Listen.
- Kwang Soo got it with me.

1666
00:57:33,320 --> 00:57:34,740
- I am talking about...
- That's right.

1667
00:57:34,740 --> 00:57:36,860
last year.
I will get it with you this year.

1668
00:57:36,860 --> 00:57:37,950
- Really? Okay.
- Yes.

1669
00:57:37,950 --> 00:57:40,430
- I'm talking about last year.
- I was almost shocked.

1670
00:57:40,430 --> 00:57:42,430
This flustered me.

1671
00:57:42,430 --> 00:57:44,820
Colonoscopy is...

1672
00:57:44,820 --> 00:57:46,990
kind of embarrassing, right?

1673
00:57:46,990 --> 00:57:47,990
It is embarrassing.

1674
00:57:47,990 --> 00:57:50,340
I was kind of...

1675
00:57:50,340 --> 00:57:53,340
embarrassed about it,
so I covered up my face.

1676
00:57:53,340 --> 00:57:56,740
When I got there, I took off my mask
and they drew my blood.

1677
00:57:56,740 --> 00:57:59,510
They called my name.

1678
00:57:59,510 --> 00:58:02,550
- "Yang Se Chan".
- Yes, that was fine.

1679
00:58:02,550 --> 00:58:04,920
First thing you do is...

1680
00:58:04,920 --> 00:58:06,070
- lie down,
- Right.

1681
00:58:06,070 --> 00:58:09,450
and they ask you your name.
Then they put you to sleep,

1682
00:58:09,450 --> 00:58:11,680
- uncover you, and proceed.
- Yes.

1683
00:58:11,680 --> 00:58:14,030
What I was flustered about was...

1684
00:58:14,030 --> 00:58:16,320
after I lied down and said my name,

1685
00:58:16,320 --> 00:58:17,590
they uncovered me.

1686
00:58:17,900 --> 00:58:21,070
"What?
I think this is the wrong order."

1687
00:58:21,070 --> 00:58:22,490
("What?
I think this is the wrong order.")

1688
00:58:23,340 --> 00:58:26,360
"The order is..."

1689
00:58:26,360 --> 00:58:28,430
That was very flustering for me.

1690
00:58:28,430 --> 00:58:29,860
- I could imagine.
- That order got messed up.

1691
00:58:29,860 --> 00:58:31,880
- That's flustering.
- He told me this before.

1692
00:58:31,880 --> 00:58:33,110
This is true.

1693
00:58:33,110 --> 00:58:34,800
- I was flustered.
- I could imagine.

1694
00:58:34,800 --> 00:58:36,550
- This is a fact.
- Too bad though.

1695
00:58:36,550 --> 00:58:39,070
If they uncovered you before asking
your name, it would be funnier.

1696
00:58:39,510 --> 00:58:41,720
They uncover you first
and then ask your name.

1697
00:58:41,720 --> 00:58:43,510
This then, "What's your name?"

1698
00:58:43,510 --> 00:58:44,590
I know.

1699
00:58:44,590 --> 00:58:45,720
("What's your name?")

1700
00:58:45,720 --> 00:58:47,360
(You would hear the echo
in the crease of his butt.)

1701
00:58:47,360 --> 00:58:48,780
Don't do that.

1702
00:58:48,780 --> 00:58:50,530
- What was that about?
- Haha, I was very flustered.

1703
00:58:50,530 --> 00:58:52,050
What was that?

1704
00:58:52,050 --> 00:58:53,430
I was very flustered.

1705
00:58:53,430 --> 00:58:55,430
There were no odd words
in his story.

1706
00:58:55,430 --> 00:58:57,530
- Look.
- But Hae Sun...

1707
00:58:57,530 --> 00:59:00,340
wasn't listening to him
while he was talking.

1708
00:59:00,360 --> 00:59:01,840
- She was deep in thought.
- No.

1709
00:59:01,840 --> 00:59:03,530
- She was thinking of her story.
- No.

1710
00:59:03,530 --> 00:59:06,340
No, that's not why.

1711
00:59:06,340 --> 00:59:08,280
Can I say this?

1712
00:59:08,380 --> 00:59:11,110
When I was talking
to the writer earlier,

1713
00:59:11,110 --> 00:59:13,610
- I said something about masks.
- Okay.

1714
00:59:13,610 --> 00:59:16,220
He, on the other hand,
went to the hospital,

1715
00:59:16,220 --> 00:59:18,150
but he didn't have to
mention the masks.

1716
00:59:18,150 --> 00:59:20,050
When he said that,
I got distracted by it.

1717
00:59:20,050 --> 00:59:21,430
Masks.

1718
00:59:22,360 --> 00:59:24,720
(In the beginning of his story,)

1719
00:59:24,720 --> 00:59:26,320
(he said he took off his mask.)

1720
00:59:26,320 --> 00:59:28,490
(Why masks all of a sudden?)

1721
00:59:28,820 --> 00:59:31,430
You're all framing me.

1722
00:59:31,430 --> 00:59:33,930
It's your turn, Hae Sun.

1723
00:59:33,930 --> 00:59:35,030
(It's Hae Sun's turn to talk.)

1724
00:59:35,360 --> 00:59:38,380
I don't really have fun stories...

1725
00:59:38,380 --> 00:59:40,700
- like that in my life.
- Me too.

1726
00:59:40,700 --> 00:59:43,780
There was an incident
that confused me though.

1727
00:59:43,780 --> 00:59:46,240
I was on the elevator,

1728
00:59:46,240 --> 00:59:50,050
and I was wearing a mask.

1729
00:59:50,050 --> 00:59:52,320
- She keeps on talking about masks.
- I know.

1730
00:59:52,320 --> 00:59:55,360
I was wearing a mask,
and I had my cap on.

1731
00:59:55,360 --> 00:59:57,490
I got on the elevator,

1732
00:59:57,490 --> 00:59:59,490
and this lady got on as well.

1733
00:59:59,490 --> 01:00:02,860
She recognized me...

1734
01:00:02,860 --> 01:00:06,240
and said, "You look much prettier
in real life," before she got off.

1735
01:00:06,240 --> 01:00:07,930
- When you covered yourself up?
- Exactly.

1736
01:00:07,930 --> 01:00:10,300
So I was confused.

1737
01:00:10,300 --> 01:00:12,180
- When you covered yourself up?
- How did she know?

1738
01:00:12,180 --> 01:00:13,400
She said I look better in person.

1739
01:00:13,400 --> 01:00:14,650
- Is that your story?
- That's it.

1740
01:00:14,650 --> 01:00:15,740
(The end)

1741
01:00:15,740 --> 01:00:17,220
(That ended in vain.)

1742
01:00:17,220 --> 01:00:18,840
What is her score?

1743
01:00:19,420 --> 01:00:21,010
She has to try again.

1744
01:00:21,010 --> 01:00:22,510
(He's stern.)

1745
01:00:22,510 --> 01:00:25,050
(Her part will get edited out.)

1746
01:00:25,050 --> 01:00:29,220
- She has to try again.
- It's Hae Sun's turn.

1747
01:00:29,220 --> 01:00:31,030
I could see that happening.
That happens.

1748
01:00:31,030 --> 01:00:33,260
Everybody told their stories
including Hae Sun,

1749
01:00:33,260 --> 01:00:34,590
and I can't tell at all.

1750
01:00:34,590 --> 01:00:36,740
- I have no clue.
- I have no idea.

1751
01:00:36,740 --> 01:00:38,530
I'm most suspicious about Kwang Soo.

1752
01:00:38,530 --> 01:00:40,740
- He's most suspicious.
- It's him.

1753
01:00:40,740 --> 01:00:42,110
How many mafias are there?

1754
01:00:42,110 --> 01:00:43,610
- One.
- See?

1755
01:00:43,610 --> 01:00:45,130
- That was strange.
- I swear it's not me.

1756
01:00:45,130 --> 01:00:46,510
- That was strange. You caught that.
- I swear it's not me.

1757
01:00:46,510 --> 01:00:47,840
- You caught that.
- I swear.

1758
01:00:48,180 --> 01:00:49,340
Time over.

1759
01:00:49,340 --> 01:00:51,110
- I have no idea.
- I think the mafia won.

1760
01:00:51,110 --> 01:00:54,610
The mafia accomplished
their mission.

1761
01:00:54,610 --> 01:00:55,820
Who was it?

1762
01:00:55,820 --> 01:00:58,320
Five of you, please write down
who the mafia is.

1763
01:00:58,320 --> 01:00:59,610
Do they not vote?

1764
01:00:59,610 --> 01:01:01,490
They don't.
It's just the five of you.

1765
01:01:01,490 --> 01:01:03,590
Will you hear my final statement?

1766
01:01:03,700 --> 01:01:04,930
Is it over once we vote?

1767
01:01:04,930 --> 01:01:07,430
See? Kwang Soo keeps on talking.

1768
01:01:07,430 --> 01:01:09,130
- I personally think it's Hae Sun.
- I'm not sure where's he's going.

1769
01:01:09,130 --> 01:01:10,340
- Who?
- I personally think it's Hae Sun.

1770
01:01:10,340 --> 01:01:12,590
- She kept saying "mask."
- She did.

1771
01:01:12,590 --> 01:01:14,430
- It's the mask.
- Right?

1772
01:01:14,430 --> 01:01:15,800
- I think.
- He's right.

1773
01:01:15,800 --> 01:01:17,510
No, I swear it's not me.

1774
01:01:17,510 --> 01:01:18,930
- It's the mask because...
- Earlier,

1775
01:01:18,930 --> 01:01:21,070
- we played the game together.
- before she started her story,

1776
01:01:21,070 --> 01:01:23,010
she pointed out his mask.

1777
01:01:23,010 --> 01:01:24,010
That's true.

1778
01:01:24,010 --> 01:01:25,070
- It's Hae Sun.
- True.

1779
01:01:25,070 --> 01:01:26,110
No...

1780
01:01:26,110 --> 01:01:27,220
If she mentioned it only once,

1781
01:01:27,220 --> 01:01:29,220
- we wouldn't have noticed.
- It wasn't weird at all.

1782
01:01:29,220 --> 01:01:30,950
She got caught because of her story.

1783
01:01:30,950 --> 01:01:32,610
- She mentioned it first.
- You got caught.

1784
01:01:32,610 --> 01:01:35,050
I think it's Kwang Soo.

1785
01:01:35,050 --> 01:01:36,360
- What if...
- You're too...

1786
01:01:36,360 --> 01:01:39,320
Kwang Soo planned this out?

1787
01:01:39,320 --> 01:01:40,800
I heard about this dream yesterday.

1788
01:01:40,800 --> 01:01:42,930
- No, I don't think...
- No.

1789
01:01:42,930 --> 01:01:44,030
it's Kwang Soo.

1790
01:01:44,030 --> 01:01:45,900
You have 10 seconds.
Please write a name down.

1791
01:01:45,900 --> 01:01:47,900
- Jong Kook, I swear it's not me.
- Nine,

1792
01:01:47,970 --> 01:01:49,130
- eight,
- Write a name down.

1793
01:01:49,130 --> 01:01:50,340
seven,

1794
01:01:50,340 --> 01:01:53,110
6, 5, 4,

1795
01:01:53,110 --> 01:01:56,950
- I told you this story.
- 3, 2, 1. Hand in your vote.

1796
01:01:56,950 --> 01:01:58,920
- I have no idea.
- I'm going to follow my instinct.

1797
01:01:58,920 --> 01:02:01,050
What if it's Jong Kook?

1798
01:02:01,150 --> 01:02:02,840
There was nothing odd about
his story though.

1799
01:02:02,840 --> 01:02:04,220
There was nothing. I had nothing.

1800
01:02:04,220 --> 01:02:06,320
I had nothing too.
Wasn't my story clean?

1801
01:02:06,320 --> 01:02:08,490
I guess it wasn't a unique word.

1802
01:02:08,590 --> 01:02:11,200
- I guess not.
- Here's the result.

1803
01:02:11,200 --> 01:02:14,670
3 votes for Hae Sun,
1 for Kwang Soo, and 1 for Se Chan.

1804
01:02:14,720 --> 01:02:15,900
Who voted for me?

1805
01:02:15,900 --> 01:02:17,170
The votes are anonymous,
so I'm not sure.

1806
01:02:17,170 --> 01:02:18,740
- Hae Sun wrote your name.
- I did.

1807
01:02:18,740 --> 01:02:19,840
She wrote your name.

1808
01:02:19,840 --> 01:02:21,110
- It was me.
- So...

1809
01:02:21,110 --> 01:02:22,840
- the mafia...
- We caught her.

1810
01:02:23,430 --> 01:02:25,930
was not arrested.

1811
01:02:25,930 --> 01:02:27,280
See?

1812
01:02:27,280 --> 01:02:28,880
(The mafia was not arrested.)

1813
01:02:28,880 --> 01:02:29,880
(Hae Sun was not the mafia.)

1814
01:02:29,880 --> 01:02:31,880
- Who was it?
- Oh, gosh.

1815
01:02:31,880 --> 01:02:33,420
- The mafia...
- I didn't think it was her.

1816
01:02:33,420 --> 01:02:34,610
- It's Jong Kook.
- It wasn't me.

1817
01:02:34,610 --> 01:02:35,680
I guess it's him.

1818
01:02:35,680 --> 01:02:37,150
It wasn't Hae Sun?

1819
01:02:37,150 --> 01:02:38,150
The mafia was...

1820
01:02:38,150 --> 01:02:40,820
(From the four of them,
the mafia was...)

1821
01:02:40,820 --> 01:02:42,050
Ji Hyo.

1822
01:02:42,050 --> 01:02:43,430
(Ji Hyo.)

1823
01:02:44,530 --> 01:02:45,950
(Ji Hyo was the mafia!)

1824
01:02:45,950 --> 01:02:47,630
- What was that?
- Oh, my goodness.

1825
01:02:47,630 --> 01:02:49,970
(Everybody is shocked.)

1826
01:02:50,030 --> 01:02:52,860
Her word was "Gyeolchoboeun."

1827
01:02:52,860 --> 01:02:53,930
(Mafia Ji Hyo's mission word was
"Gyeolchoboeun.")

1828
01:02:54,430 --> 01:02:56,840
- What?
- Really?

1829
01:02:56,840 --> 01:02:58,800
You asked her to say
a four-character idiom.

1830
01:02:58,800 --> 01:03:00,740
Why did you ask her to say it?

1831
01:03:00,740 --> 01:03:02,680
She's not even on your team.

1832
01:03:04,570 --> 01:03:07,240
(She had to say, "Gyeolchoboeun.")

1833
01:03:07,240 --> 01:03:09,240
(How do I say it?)

1834
01:03:09,950 --> 01:03:12,610
(At that moment)

1835
01:03:12,610 --> 01:03:14,320
(That was easy.)

1836
01:03:14,320 --> 01:03:15,720
(She kept a poker face...)

1837
01:03:15,720 --> 01:03:18,430
(and said, "Gyeolchoboeun".)

1838
01:03:18,990 --> 01:03:22,130
(Jae Suk saved her.)

1839
01:03:22,590 --> 01:03:24,800
(He deeply criticizes Jae Suk.)

1840
01:03:24,800 --> 01:03:26,240
(He gets criticized more.)

1841
01:03:26,240 --> 01:03:27,740
- I kept on thinking about it.
- Weren't you so happy?

1842
01:03:27,740 --> 01:03:29,610
- He told you to say it.
- I totally took it.

1843
01:03:29,610 --> 01:03:30,780
"Gyeolchoboeun"!

1844
01:03:30,900 --> 01:03:33,280
Why do you think she said it
when she didn't know its meaning?

1845
01:03:33,280 --> 01:03:35,280
- You talk too much.
- I did it.

1846
01:03:35,280 --> 01:03:36,740
Why did you ask her?

1847
01:03:36,740 --> 01:03:38,510
He always wants to lead.

1848
01:03:38,510 --> 01:03:40,150
- I'm sorry.
- My gosh.

1849
01:03:40,150 --> 01:03:41,840
He's the type...

1850
01:03:41,840 --> 01:03:43,240
- who turns the table upside down.
- Exactly.

1851
01:03:43,780 --> 01:03:45,820
He turned
everybody's table upside down.

1852
01:03:45,920 --> 01:03:47,880
He's the problem.

1853
01:03:47,880 --> 01:03:49,950
That was a difficult word.

1854
01:03:49,950 --> 01:03:51,090
That was difficult.

1855
01:03:51,090 --> 01:03:52,530
She couldn't have done it
without Jae Suk.

1856
01:03:52,530 --> 01:03:55,630
Only Ji Hyo will choose from
the good zone on this team.

1857
01:03:55,630 --> 01:03:56,720
Everybody else will choose
from the bad zone.

1858
01:03:56,720 --> 01:03:58,630
- She did really well.
- That was so hard.

1859
01:03:58,630 --> 01:04:01,070
Four of them were fine.

1860
01:04:01,070 --> 01:04:03,610
I'm amazed by Ji Hyo's ability.

1861
01:04:03,610 --> 01:04:05,930
We know she's studying hard
these days.

1862
01:04:05,930 --> 01:04:07,240
I know. It's true.

1863
01:04:07,240 --> 01:04:10,050
Once she gets married,
she'll trick her husband too.

1864
01:04:10,050 --> 01:04:11,150
- I will?
- What are you talking about?

1865
01:04:11,150 --> 01:04:12,320
- You completely got me.
- Why would you say that?

1866
01:04:12,320 --> 01:04:13,680
Why would she trick her husband?

1867
01:04:13,680 --> 01:04:15,610
(Laughing)

1868
01:04:15,610 --> 01:04:18,090
If this is going to go like this,

1869
01:04:18,090 --> 01:04:19,260
- We have the disadvantage.
- our team's in trouble.

1870
01:04:19,260 --> 01:04:21,090
- It can't be me.
- Let's pick.

1871
01:04:21,090 --> 01:04:23,590
- Please check your cards alone.
- This is a challenge.

1872
01:04:23,590 --> 01:04:24,590
(It's Team Jong Ok turn.)

1873
01:04:25,400 --> 01:04:26,900
This is so...

1874
01:04:27,220 --> 01:04:28,990
You're supposed to not say anything.

1875
01:04:28,990 --> 01:04:31,860
- Suk Jin looks anxious.
- Suk Jin.

1876
01:04:31,860 --> 01:04:33,930
(He sees that Suk Jin is tense.)

1877
01:04:33,930 --> 01:04:36,130
- I already caught you.
- Why?

1878
01:04:36,170 --> 01:04:38,240
Suk Jin, look at your legs.

1879
01:04:38,240 --> 01:04:39,800
- Hey.
- It's so obvious.

1880
01:04:39,800 --> 01:04:41,880
- Don't...
- I caught him.

1881
01:04:41,950 --> 01:04:43,150
- Listen.
- I caught you.

1882
01:04:43,150 --> 01:04:45,680
Don't get swayed by this.
Fine. You can pick me.

1883
01:04:45,680 --> 01:04:49,110
- He's really tense.
- He kept on looking at his card.

1884
01:04:49,110 --> 01:04:50,110
- That's true.
- Really?

1885
01:04:50,110 --> 01:04:51,260
He saw it,

1886
01:04:51,260 --> 01:04:52,610
- and this was his face.
- He kept on doing this.

1887
01:04:52,610 --> 01:04:53,950
He squinted...

1888
01:04:53,950 --> 01:04:55,320
and had this peculiar smile.

1889
01:04:55,320 --> 01:04:57,630
Who would like to talk first?

1890
01:04:57,630 --> 01:04:58,720
So Min.

1891
01:04:59,030 --> 01:05:01,220
This is not a funny story.

1892
01:05:01,220 --> 01:05:03,170
I went home a couple of days ago...

1893
01:05:03,170 --> 01:05:05,130
for the Korean New Year.

1894
01:05:05,130 --> 01:05:07,700
My dad and mom drove in one car,

1895
01:05:07,700 --> 01:05:11,070
while my brother and I were
in another car.

1896
01:05:11,070 --> 01:05:13,340
We parked and got off.

1897
01:05:13,340 --> 01:05:15,700
I helped my dad park too.

1898
01:05:15,700 --> 01:05:18,610
All of a sudden, my dad sighed...

1899
01:05:18,610 --> 01:05:20,590
- after looking at my brother's car.
- My mom's like,

1900
01:05:20,590 --> 01:05:23,780
"Wook Min! That punk,"
and she ran to him.

1901
01:05:23,780 --> 01:05:26,820
He hit another car
while he was parking.

1902
01:05:26,820 --> 01:05:29,820
- It was a collision.
- My dad got mad at him...

1903
01:05:29,820 --> 01:05:31,900
and opened his car door,

1904
01:05:31,900 --> 01:05:33,990
but there was a middle-aged man
sitting inside.

1905
01:05:33,990 --> 01:05:35,070
It was somebody else.

1906
01:05:35,070 --> 01:05:37,090
- It wasn't your brother?
- It wasn't his car.

1907
01:05:37,090 --> 01:05:38,340
(It wasn't her brother's car.)

1908
01:05:38,340 --> 01:05:40,630
He got mad at a stranger?

1909
01:05:40,740 --> 01:05:42,740
My dad apologized.

1910
01:05:42,740 --> 01:05:45,900
Oddly, it was the same car
and color.

1911
01:05:45,900 --> 01:05:47,700
Good thing it wasn't him.

1912
01:05:47,700 --> 01:05:50,180
That person was probably upset
already, and he opened the door.

1913
01:05:50,420 --> 01:05:51,720
It can't be "middle-aged man."

1914
01:05:51,720 --> 01:05:53,510
It's not. It can't be that easy.

1915
01:05:53,510 --> 01:05:55,240
- Nothing really stood out.
- Right?

1916
01:05:55,240 --> 01:05:57,610
It was "Gyeolchoboeun" earlier,

1917
01:05:57,610 --> 01:05:58,950
- so it has to be an unusual word.
- True.

1918
01:05:58,950 --> 01:06:01,590
They assign words...

1919
01:06:01,590 --> 01:06:02,630
- that sound awkward.
- I agree.

1920
01:06:02,630 --> 01:06:04,050
- That wasn't odd at all.
- Not at all.

1921
01:06:04,050 --> 01:06:06,130
- I used simple words.
- Car type and color.

1922
01:06:06,130 --> 01:06:09,070
This happened earlier today.
It wasn't surprising or anything.

1923
01:06:09,070 --> 01:06:10,800
When we had to wear tights...

1924
01:06:10,800 --> 01:06:13,240
and roll ourselves
to the bowling pins,

1925
01:06:13,240 --> 01:06:15,070
Suk Jin said this
in the waiting room.

1926
01:06:15,070 --> 01:06:18,030
"Do I have to wear this
at my age..."

1927
01:06:18,340 --> 01:06:21,150
"and play this game?
This has to change."

1928
01:06:21,150 --> 01:06:23,920
"Variety shows have to change.
They think this is funny,"

1929
01:06:23,920 --> 01:06:25,920
"but they should
seriously reconsider."

1930
01:06:25,920 --> 01:06:29,450
"I feel sorry for the guests."
As soon as we start filming...

1931
01:06:29,510 --> 01:06:30,880
(As soon as they started filming...)

1932
01:06:32,360 --> 01:06:33,680
Good story.

1933
01:06:33,680 --> 01:06:35,720
- Good story.
- Did you see him roll?

1934
01:06:35,720 --> 01:06:37,990
(He's going to cross the ocean
doing a somersault.)

1935
01:06:38,200 --> 01:06:40,530
That was fun though.
The tights weren't bad.

1936
01:06:40,530 --> 01:06:41,860
Why did you say that then?

1937
01:06:41,860 --> 01:06:44,070
Because tights are old style.

1938
01:06:44,070 --> 01:06:45,970
- I see.
- That's why I said it.

1939
01:06:45,970 --> 01:06:47,570
I see.

1940
01:06:47,860 --> 01:06:50,110
- Should I go?
- Sure, go ahead.

1941
01:06:50,110 --> 01:06:53,700
- I said this on a different show.
- Go ahead.

1942
01:06:53,700 --> 01:06:55,110
I was really flustered by this.

1943
01:06:55,110 --> 01:06:57,110
You sound weird already.

1944
01:06:57,320 --> 01:06:59,880
- Go ahead.
- Spy.

1945
01:06:59,880 --> 01:07:01,840
- Go, mafia.
- Go ahead.

1946
01:07:01,840 --> 01:07:04,490
- Let's hear it.
- Hey, don't do this.

1947
01:07:04,490 --> 01:07:06,360
Don't do this. Don't trust him.

1948
01:07:06,360 --> 01:07:07,490
Don't trust him.

1949
01:07:07,490 --> 01:07:09,430
Fine, go ahead.

1950
01:07:09,430 --> 01:07:11,700
- Listen carefully.
- Okay.

1951
01:07:11,720 --> 01:07:13,150
- My friend...
- Your friend.

1952
01:07:13,150 --> 01:07:15,990
said this to me
because I'm playing golf again.

1953
01:07:15,990 --> 01:07:17,930
- You're playing golf.
- He has a driver...

1954
01:07:17,930 --> 01:07:19,070
A driver?

1955
01:07:19,430 --> 01:07:21,030
- It's a driver.
- Fine.

1956
01:07:21,030 --> 01:07:22,930
- I said this on "Men on a Mission."
- Sure.

1957
01:07:22,970 --> 01:07:25,700
He has a driver
that can hit over 300m,

1958
01:07:25,930 --> 01:07:29,550
but it's really expensive.
It's around 2,000 dollars.

1959
01:07:29,550 --> 01:07:31,050
- 2,000 dollars?
- Yes, 2,000 dollars.

1960
01:07:31,050 --> 01:07:33,070
That's three.

1961
01:07:33,070 --> 01:07:34,920
How's this 2,000 dollars?

1962
01:07:34,920 --> 01:07:36,220
Right?

1963
01:07:36,220 --> 01:07:37,860
- Hey!
- He had three fingers.

1964
01:07:37,860 --> 01:07:39,090
- Hey!
- How's this 2,000 dollars?

1965
01:07:39,090 --> 01:07:40,320
He pretended to be relaxed.

1966
01:07:40,320 --> 01:07:42,430
- He held up three fingers.
- Do I seem like the mafia?

1967
01:07:42,630 --> 01:07:43,820
He simply made an observation.

1968
01:07:43,820 --> 01:07:45,650
We still have time.

1969
01:07:45,860 --> 01:07:47,050
It must be his mission word.

1970
01:07:48,320 --> 01:07:50,490
It makes no sense.
It's not like it's a goblin's club.

1971
01:07:50,490 --> 01:07:52,740
- 300m? Come on.
- "Goblin's club"?

1972
01:07:52,740 --> 01:07:54,470
- "Goblin's club"?
- "Goblin's club"?

1973
01:07:54,670 --> 01:07:56,700
Did he mention "Goblin's club"
on "Men on a Mission"?

1974
01:07:56,760 --> 01:07:58,430
- I don't think he did.
- He didn't, right?

1975
01:07:58,430 --> 01:07:59,570
"Goblin's club."

1976
01:07:59,570 --> 01:08:01,280
That word is totally suspicious.

1977
01:08:01,280 --> 01:08:03,470
- It's not a golf word.
- Seriously.

1978
01:08:03,470 --> 01:08:05,470
- It's not a word you usually use.
- In any case,

1979
01:08:05,680 --> 01:08:08,510
he said it costs
about 2,000 dollars.

1980
01:08:08,590 --> 01:08:10,420
I went home
and told my wife about it.

1981
01:08:10,550 --> 01:08:12,280
She searched on the internet...

1982
01:08:12,780 --> 01:08:14,050
and found one
that costs 400 dollars.

1983
01:08:14,130 --> 01:08:15,590
A goblin's club
that costs 400 dollars?

1984
01:08:15,860 --> 01:08:16,990
A driver!

1985
01:08:16,990 --> 01:08:18,200
(Frustrated)

1986
01:08:18,320 --> 01:08:20,670
I ordered it.
When I received the parcel,

1987
01:08:20,720 --> 01:08:22,400
I saw that it was this big.

1988
01:08:22,570 --> 01:08:25,760
- Was it a screwdriver?
- No, it wasn't a screwdriver.

1989
01:08:26,030 --> 01:08:28,470
- I only got the head.
- The head.

1990
01:08:29,070 --> 01:08:30,340
I know this story.

1991
01:08:30,340 --> 01:08:31,610
He told the exact same story.

1992
01:08:31,610 --> 01:08:34,200
I even texted him
after watching "Men on a Mission"...

1993
01:08:34,200 --> 01:08:35,240
because it was so funny.

1994
01:08:35,240 --> 01:08:36,880
- "Goblin's club."
- That was a new addition.

1995
01:08:36,880 --> 01:08:38,050
That's right.

1996
01:08:38,050 --> 01:08:39,510
(Suk Jin's story was
a bit suspicious.)

1997
01:08:39,510 --> 01:08:43,590
If you turn out to be a citizen,
that means you are a weirdo.

1998
01:08:43,590 --> 01:08:44,880
I am a citizen!

1999
01:08:44,880 --> 01:08:46,950
- Maybe he did it for attention.
- I have never heard him...

2000
01:08:46,950 --> 01:08:50,430
use a word like "Goblin's club."

2001
01:08:50,430 --> 01:08:52,360
You guys keep making me
look suspicious.

2002
01:08:52,360 --> 01:08:55,470
Stop giving us a strange reaction
if you are a citizen.

2003
01:08:55,800 --> 01:08:57,260
You should be upset.

2004
01:08:57,340 --> 01:08:59,170
"Goblin's club" is...

2005
01:08:59,300 --> 01:09:03,530
Keep in mind that the last time
we focused on one word,

2006
01:09:03,530 --> 01:09:05,700
- the actual mafia get away.
- That's right.

2007
01:09:05,700 --> 01:09:07,200
I think we are right
about "Goblin's club."

2008
01:09:07,200 --> 01:09:08,610
- All right. Who is next?
- Haha.

2009
01:09:08,610 --> 01:09:10,570
A few weeks ago,

2010
01:09:10,740 --> 01:09:15,020
Se Chan, Jong Kook,
and I had a shoot.

2011
01:09:15,020 --> 01:09:18,420
The topic of So Min came up
for some reason...

2012
01:09:18,420 --> 01:09:19,980
and we talked about her.

2013
01:09:19,980 --> 01:09:21,890
That night,

2014
01:09:22,060 --> 01:09:25,300
Se Chan got very drunk.

2015
01:09:25,300 --> 01:09:27,860
I don't know if he remembers this.

2016
01:09:28,060 --> 01:09:30,520
He called me.

2017
01:09:30,670 --> 01:09:33,940
He said he doesn't know
how he feels.

2018
01:09:33,940 --> 01:09:35,230
- Did Se Chan say that?
- Yes.

2019
01:09:35,230 --> 01:09:38,700
He said he has never dated
a same-aged woman.

2020
01:09:38,770 --> 01:09:41,180
- For goodness' sake.
- "A woman his age."

2021
01:09:41,350 --> 01:09:43,140
(The story is a bit suspicious.)

2022
01:09:43,140 --> 01:09:45,570
Keep going. Keep making things up.

2023
01:09:45,640 --> 01:09:47,140
"I have only dated women
who are younger or older."

2024
01:09:47,140 --> 01:09:49,280
"Have you dated women
who are older than you?"

2025
01:09:49,390 --> 01:09:51,020
"I see."

2026
01:09:51,020 --> 01:09:53,020
"How much older was she?"

2027
01:09:54,020 --> 01:09:55,950
He wanted to say, "One year older."

2028
01:09:55,950 --> 01:09:57,130
I guess he was too drunk.

2029
01:09:57,350 --> 01:09:58,990
He said, "First year older."

2030
01:09:59,650 --> 01:10:02,060
(First year older)

2031
01:10:02,690 --> 01:10:03,970
Listen.

2032
01:10:04,190 --> 01:10:06,360
I am not that dumb.

2033
01:10:06,440 --> 01:10:08,440
I didn't say that to him.

2034
01:10:08,530 --> 01:10:10,100
I didn't call him.

2035
01:10:10,170 --> 01:10:11,880
- You are the worst.
- Did you say,

2036
01:10:11,880 --> 01:10:13,270
- "First year older"?
- You are the worst.

2037
01:10:13,310 --> 01:10:15,440
- You were totally wasted.
- You are...

2038
01:10:15,440 --> 01:10:17,420
- You were totally wasted.
- You are a piece of trash!

2039
01:10:17,810 --> 01:10:19,140
You were totally wasted.

2040
01:10:19,180 --> 01:10:20,440
You were totally wasted.

2041
01:10:20,570 --> 01:10:23,740
We did talk about So Min
throughout the shoot that day.

2042
01:10:24,110 --> 01:10:26,110
- For goodness' sake.
- "First year older"? Unbelievable.

2043
01:10:26,110 --> 01:10:28,760
I didn't call him.
It's a blatant lie. He is the mafia!

2044
01:10:28,760 --> 01:10:30,990
I relayed the story to So Min.

2045
01:10:30,990 --> 01:10:32,690
I even talked with her mom.

2046
01:10:32,690 --> 01:10:33,800
That's right.

2047
01:10:33,800 --> 01:10:35,890
- I was with my mom.
- She wants to see you, Se Chan.

2048
01:10:35,930 --> 01:10:37,060
By the way, Se Chan,

2049
01:10:37,060 --> 01:10:41,840
you should have called me.
Why did you call Haha?

2050
01:10:41,940 --> 01:10:43,310
- This is driving me crazy.
- Hey.

2051
01:10:43,310 --> 01:10:44,640
Her book is titled,

2052
01:10:44,680 --> 01:10:46,480
"You Can Call Me After a Drink."

2053
01:10:46,880 --> 01:10:48,510
Haha is ridiculous.

2054
01:10:48,510 --> 01:10:50,720
But Haha doesn't usually say
"Same-aged."

2055
01:10:50,720 --> 01:10:52,240
- No, he doesn't.
- "A woman his age" is more natural.

2056
01:10:52,420 --> 01:10:55,110
"First year older" is
more suspicious.

2057
01:10:55,110 --> 01:10:56,590
Let's move on...

2058
01:10:56,590 --> 01:10:59,060
- to Jong Ok's story first.
- Okay. Let's go.

2059
01:10:59,420 --> 01:11:01,090
"Goblin's club" and "Same-aged"...

2060
01:11:01,090 --> 01:11:02,930
- were suspicious.
- "Same-aged."

2061
01:11:02,930 --> 01:11:05,350
- "Same-aged" sounds strange.
- No, it isn't. It's used often.

2062
01:11:05,430 --> 01:11:06,650
Jong Ok, you are up.

2063
01:11:06,650 --> 01:11:09,670
This is something ridiculous
I experienced a long time ago.

2064
01:11:09,670 --> 01:11:12,190
Back then, I was starring in
"Men of the Bath House."

2065
01:11:12,860 --> 01:11:14,270
- I enjoyed it a lot.
- I loved that drama.

2066
01:11:14,670 --> 01:11:17,680
I was dining at a hotel...

2067
01:11:17,680 --> 01:11:20,940
when a middle-aged man told me
that he is a big fan.

2068
01:11:20,940 --> 01:11:23,310
I talked to him briefly
and we parted.

2069
01:11:23,310 --> 01:11:26,020
I don't know how, but he called me
after getting a hold of my number.

2070
01:11:26,020 --> 01:11:27,350
- Really?
- Yes.

2071
01:11:27,350 --> 01:11:31,390
"I am the man who said hello to you
at the hotel."

2072
01:11:31,390 --> 01:11:32,560
I was like, "Okay."

2073
01:11:32,560 --> 01:11:36,150
"I called you to help you..."

2074
01:11:36,150 --> 01:11:39,300
"because I have seen you work hard
at the set."

2075
01:11:39,690 --> 01:11:41,990
"If you buy the stocks
of a such-and-such company,"

2076
01:11:41,990 --> 01:11:44,770
"the price will go up.
So please buy them."

2077
01:11:44,770 --> 01:11:46,490
"You can trust me."

2078
01:11:46,490 --> 01:11:48,200
"Please buy them."

2079
01:11:48,200 --> 01:11:50,880
For a second, I got tempted
because I am easily swayed.

2080
01:11:50,880 --> 01:11:53,730
- I am easily swayed.
- You are easily swayed.

2081
01:11:53,880 --> 01:11:55,680
I am easily swayed.

2082
01:11:55,900 --> 01:11:58,610
After consideration,
I bought a bit of stock.

2083
01:11:58,610 --> 01:12:01,720
A week later,
the bank went bankrupt.

2084
01:12:01,810 --> 01:12:03,020
- Really?
- Yes.

2085
01:12:03,020 --> 01:12:04,350
He was a swindler.

2086
01:12:04,350 --> 01:12:05,610
And you had no idea who he was.

2087
01:12:05,720 --> 01:12:08,280
How did he get your number?
It's insane.

2088
01:12:08,350 --> 01:12:11,230
I am telling this story
so that he would see it.

2089
01:12:11,890 --> 01:12:13,800
- You know,
- That swindler.

2090
01:12:13,800 --> 01:12:17,020
- I have a similar story.
- He does.

2091
01:12:17,020 --> 01:12:18,470
- Let me tell you the story.
- Okay.

2092
01:12:18,530 --> 01:12:20,230
I was very lonely.

2093
01:12:20,230 --> 01:12:21,770
I didn't have a girlfriend.
I was single.

2094
01:12:22,200 --> 01:12:24,200
You know Broadway Theater, right?
Is it still there?

2095
01:12:24,200 --> 01:12:25,530
I know the theater.
I visited it often in the past.

2096
01:12:25,530 --> 01:12:26,680
- You know the theater, right?
- That's right.

2097
01:12:26,680 --> 01:12:28,180
- I went there and...
- It's near Sinsa Station.

2098
01:12:28,180 --> 01:12:29,480
Do you know the movie,
"The Contact"?

2099
01:12:29,480 --> 01:12:30,810
Of course, I do.

2100
01:12:30,810 --> 01:12:32,220
You know the movie, right?

2101
01:12:32,220 --> 01:12:36,520
"The Contact" is a movie about
realizing love.

2102
01:12:36,520 --> 01:12:38,780
Since I was very lonely,

2103
01:12:38,780 --> 01:12:40,780
my eyes wandered to women.

2104
01:12:40,780 --> 01:12:42,130
In front of me,

2105
01:12:42,190 --> 01:12:45,260
I saw a pink tracksuit.

2106
01:12:45,430 --> 01:12:48,600
- Pink goblin's club.
- Wasn't it a pink goblin's club?

2107
01:12:48,730 --> 01:12:51,670
- A pink tracksuit.
- You saw a pink goblin's club.

2108
01:12:51,770 --> 01:12:54,200
"Give me gold!"

2109
01:12:54,310 --> 01:12:56,060
- It can hit over 300m.
- Go on.

2110
01:12:56,060 --> 01:12:59,340
I saw a really fine woman
in a tracksuit.

2111
01:12:59,840 --> 01:13:03,350
I was too shy back then,
so I sat a few seats away from her.

2112
01:13:03,350 --> 01:13:06,020
About three days later,
I got a call.

2113
01:13:06,310 --> 01:13:08,420
- How...
- The caller was a woman.

2114
01:13:08,420 --> 01:13:09,720
"Hello?"

2115
01:13:09,920 --> 01:13:13,390
"Didn't you recently watch a movie
at Broadway Theater?"

2116
01:13:13,850 --> 01:13:17,260
"Do you remember a woman
in a pink tracksuit?"

2117
01:13:17,890 --> 01:13:19,020
She said that.

2118
01:13:19,020 --> 01:13:20,320
I said, "Yes, I remember."

2119
01:13:20,690 --> 01:13:22,130
- "I am that woman."
- That's scary.

2120
01:13:23,270 --> 01:13:24,690
- Was she a ghost?
- That's so scary.

2121
01:13:24,690 --> 01:13:25,800
This is a true story.

2122
01:13:26,100 --> 01:13:28,440
Did she get your number by using
a goblin's club?

2123
01:13:29,340 --> 01:13:32,140
(Give me the number!)

2124
01:13:32,140 --> 01:13:34,940
Did she get your number by using
a goblin's club?

2125
01:13:34,940 --> 01:13:37,240
- No! I didn't bring it up.
- A goblin's club.

2126
01:13:37,240 --> 01:13:38,420
- Keep going.
- A goblin's club.

2127
01:13:38,480 --> 01:13:40,180
- For goodness' sake.
- "Give me the number!"

2128
01:13:41,480 --> 01:13:43,720
I still remember what she said.

2129
01:13:43,720 --> 01:13:44,890
She will recognize me
if she sees this.

2130
01:13:44,890 --> 01:13:46,060
Do you want to find her?

2131
01:13:47,060 --> 01:13:49,690
- "Love on the Air."
- Do this on "Love on the Air."

2132
01:13:49,690 --> 01:13:50,850
Listen.

2133
01:13:51,150 --> 01:13:54,730
I know every single story
about Suk Jin.

2134
01:13:54,730 --> 01:13:56,190
- Is this story new?
- It must be new to him.

2135
01:13:56,320 --> 01:13:58,640
- This story is new.
- Was it a red tracksuit?

2136
01:13:58,640 --> 01:14:01,010
Maybe the mission word is
"Pink tracksuit."

2137
01:14:01,010 --> 01:14:03,060
- It must be "Tracksuit."
- "Tracksuit."

2138
01:14:03,230 --> 01:14:06,100
- This story is new.
- You can vote for me,

2139
01:14:06,480 --> 01:14:08,770
but think about
why they are attacking me.

2140
01:14:08,770 --> 01:14:10,200
If you vote for me, we will lose.

2141
01:14:10,200 --> 01:14:13,180
Do you know why Suk Jin told
two stories?

2142
01:14:13,180 --> 01:14:14,740
He couldn't use his mission word
when he told the first one.

2143
01:14:14,740 --> 01:14:15,980
- That's what I think too.
- That's why...

2144
01:14:15,980 --> 01:14:18,260
- he told another story.
- That's what I find suspicious.

2145
01:14:18,260 --> 01:14:21,590
Ji Hyo followed up
with her story in a natural way.

2146
01:14:21,590 --> 01:14:22,820
This is the same thing.

2147
01:14:24,060 --> 01:14:26,800
- The mission word is "Tracksuit."
- That's right.

2148
01:14:26,800 --> 01:14:28,190
What do you think, Jong Ok?

2149
01:14:28,190 --> 01:14:29,270
What?

2150
01:14:29,270 --> 01:14:30,430
Who are you suspicious of?

2151
01:14:30,600 --> 01:14:33,140
You become really distant at times.

2152
01:14:33,490 --> 01:14:36,060
Just when I think we are close,

2153
01:14:36,340 --> 01:14:38,730
you become really distant.

2154
01:14:39,180 --> 01:14:40,640
"What?"

2155
01:14:40,730 --> 01:14:42,600
That sounded so cold.

2156
01:14:42,600 --> 01:14:44,100
She is friendly.

2157
01:14:44,520 --> 01:14:46,550
(Was I too cold?)

2158
01:14:46,810 --> 01:14:49,890
Haha didn't have to use
the word, "Same-aged."

2159
01:14:49,890 --> 01:14:51,390
So the mafia is
either Suk Jin or me.

2160
01:14:51,390 --> 01:14:52,480
But I really am not the mafia.

2161
01:14:52,480 --> 01:14:54,260
- I really am not the mafia.
- My story was natural.

2162
01:14:54,260 --> 01:14:56,520
Fine! Vote for me!
Vote for me and lose.

2163
01:14:56,520 --> 01:14:57,990
The most eccentric word
we heard was...

2164
01:14:57,990 --> 01:14:59,800
- "Goblin's club."
- "Goblin's club."

2165
01:14:59,800 --> 01:15:00,970
That's right.

2166
01:15:01,060 --> 01:15:02,770
"Pink tracksuit" too.

2167
01:15:02,770 --> 01:15:06,440
I thought about how things were
back in the days.

2168
01:15:06,470 --> 01:15:07,730
When "The Contact" was released,

2169
01:15:07,730 --> 01:15:10,270
a pink tracksuit wasn't something
women wore.

2170
01:15:10,270 --> 01:15:11,880
A tracksuit with the word "Pink."

2171
01:15:12,010 --> 01:15:13,730
- A tracksuit with the word "Pink."
- That's right.

2172
01:15:13,730 --> 01:15:16,350
It only became popular after 2000.

2173
01:15:16,350 --> 01:15:17,920
- Jong Ok.
- It became trendy later.

2174
01:15:17,920 --> 01:15:20,920
When "The Contact" was released,
didn't women wear pink tracksuits?

2175
01:15:20,920 --> 01:15:22,020
I don't remember.

2176
01:15:22,020 --> 01:15:24,260
(She refuses to help him.)

2177
01:15:24,310 --> 01:15:25,450
Jong Ok.

2178
01:15:25,520 --> 01:15:26,650
She became distant, right?

2179
01:15:26,650 --> 01:15:28,890
- I thought we were close.
- She is icy.

2180
01:15:28,890 --> 01:15:30,020
- She became distant.
- She is like that.

2181
01:15:30,020 --> 01:15:32,300
She becomes distant at times.

2182
01:15:32,300 --> 01:15:33,730
Jong Ok, vote for me if you want.

2183
01:15:33,730 --> 01:15:35,390
- But we'll lose.
- All right.

2184
01:15:35,390 --> 01:15:37,840
- For some reason,
- You know...

2185
01:15:37,840 --> 01:15:40,030
I always say strange things.

2186
01:15:40,030 --> 01:15:41,510
This team made it had.

2187
01:15:41,900 --> 01:15:45,200
- I think it's Suk Jin.
- I am not the mafia.

2188
01:15:45,200 --> 01:15:47,440
- "Pink tracksuit" is just...
- It's confusing.

2189
01:15:47,600 --> 01:15:48,700
It just sounded strange.

2190
01:15:48,700 --> 01:15:51,110
I am not the mafia.
For goodness' sake.

2191
01:15:51,110 --> 01:15:52,850
It's "Same-aged."
Think about it again.

2192
01:15:52,850 --> 01:15:55,980
Think about it again.
Otherwise, we will lose.

2193
01:15:56,350 --> 01:15:58,150
- It's one of them.
- This is driving me crazy.

2194
01:15:59,520 --> 01:16:01,060
The result is out.

2195
01:16:01,060 --> 01:16:02,390
- All right.
- Out of five votes,

2196
01:16:02,690 --> 01:16:04,730
Suk Jin received three votes...

2197
01:16:05,020 --> 01:16:06,190
and Haha received two votes.

2198
01:16:06,190 --> 01:16:08,190
- 2 votes.
- A difference of 1 vote.

2199
01:16:08,190 --> 01:16:09,630
Jong Ok, I bet you voted for me.

2200
01:16:09,630 --> 01:16:11,060
All right.

2201
01:16:11,060 --> 01:16:12,560
Please tell us right away.

2202
01:16:12,560 --> 01:16:14,140
The mafia...

2203
01:16:14,140 --> 01:16:16,700
(Suk Jin was the most suspicious.)

2204
01:16:16,700 --> 01:16:18,840
(Is Suk Jin the mafia?)

2205
01:16:18,840 --> 01:16:20,010
was arrested.

2206
01:16:20,010 --> 01:16:21,740
(The mafia was arrested.)

2207
01:16:21,740 --> 01:16:22,810
The mission word was...

2208
01:16:22,810 --> 01:16:24,270
- "Goblin's club."
- I knew it.

2209
01:16:24,270 --> 01:16:25,770
(The mission word was
"Goblin's club.")

2210
01:16:27,550 --> 01:16:29,440
Hey! I almost died
from the suspense...

2211
01:16:29,520 --> 01:16:31,260
because of you guys.

2212
01:16:31,310 --> 01:16:33,060
My mouth went dry.

2213
01:16:33,260 --> 01:16:34,560
I was like,

2214
01:16:34,560 --> 01:16:36,430
"Did he say 'Goblin's club'?"

2215
01:16:36,480 --> 01:16:38,990
- The two of them ruined it for me.
- 2,000 dollars.

2216
01:16:39,060 --> 01:16:40,650
- "Did he say 'Goblin's club'?"
- 2,000 dollars.

2217
01:16:40,650 --> 01:16:41,670
(He held up three fingers.)

2218
01:16:41,670 --> 01:16:43,320
The two of them ruined it for me.

2219
01:16:43,320 --> 01:16:45,060
It became obvious
because of "Goblin's club."

2220
01:16:45,060 --> 01:16:46,840
Thus,

2221
01:16:46,840 --> 01:16:49,270
everyone except for Suk Jin
will choose...

2222
01:16:49,270 --> 01:16:50,940
- from the good zone.
- I will still pick a good bag.

2223
01:16:51,530 --> 01:16:54,180
This is the last round
of picking the bags.

2224
01:16:54,180 --> 01:16:55,680
- Bring in the bags.
- My goodness.

2225
01:16:55,680 --> 01:16:57,380
- This is the last round.
- This will finalize the result.

2226
01:16:57,380 --> 01:16:58,770
(The last round
will finalize the ranking.)

2227
01:16:59,380 --> 01:17:01,280
We will now begin Round Three...

2228
01:17:01,280 --> 01:17:03,890
and pick the bags.

2229
01:17:03,940 --> 01:17:05,590
Shall we start with the good zone?

2230
01:17:05,590 --> 01:17:07,560
- Okay.
- Suk Jin, go over there.

2231
01:17:08,480 --> 01:17:10,130
- That's right.
- Goblin, come over here.

2232
01:17:10,130 --> 01:17:12,350
- Ji Hyo picks from the good zone.
- Goblin.

2233
01:17:12,350 --> 01:17:13,600
You know,

2234
01:17:13,600 --> 01:17:15,800
I am in eighth place.
I am too close to the penalty.

2235
01:17:16,170 --> 01:17:17,560
- This is bad.
- Now,

2236
01:17:17,840 --> 01:17:19,170
which zone goes first?

2237
01:17:19,170 --> 01:17:20,770
- The good zone.
- That's us.

2238
01:17:20,770 --> 01:17:22,600
Not all bags in the good zone
are good.

2239
01:17:22,600 --> 01:17:23,700
- That's right.
- Yes.

2240
01:17:23,700 --> 01:17:25,840
- Which one should I pick?
- You are in second place.

2241
01:17:25,980 --> 01:17:27,570
Jong Ok, you will be
in first place...

2242
01:17:27,570 --> 01:17:29,070
- if you pick well.
- That's right.

2243
01:17:29,240 --> 01:17:30,980
It's time to make a choice.

2244
01:17:31,550 --> 01:17:32,680
- Number 15.
- Number 15.

2245
01:17:32,680 --> 01:17:33,850
It would be incredible
if she gets the switch chance.

2246
01:17:34,850 --> 01:17:36,240
(Jong Ok picks number 15)

2247
01:17:36,240 --> 01:17:38,090
- 20 dollars.
- 20 dollars.

2248
01:17:38,090 --> 01:17:40,260
- She's currently in first place.
- Really?

2249
01:17:40,260 --> 01:17:41,450
- She's in 1st place.
- 130 dollars.

2250
01:17:41,450 --> 01:17:43,950
- I pick number 18.
- It's So Min, Jong Kook, and me.

2251
01:17:44,090 --> 01:17:45,150
Number 21.

2252
01:17:46,130 --> 01:17:47,320
Please.

2253
01:17:47,320 --> 01:17:50,130
(Ji Hyo gets plus 1 dollar,
and So Min gets plus 10 dollars.)

2254
01:17:50,230 --> 01:17:51,600
I got 10 dollars.

2255
01:17:52,100 --> 01:17:54,840
- As long as you're not last.
- I'm in trouble. This won't work.

2256
01:17:54,840 --> 01:17:56,310
So Min is getting the penalty.

2257
01:17:56,640 --> 01:17:58,180
There's still Suk Jin.

2258
01:17:58,180 --> 01:17:59,180
Me.

2259
01:17:59,180 --> 01:18:01,180
- You need to pick a minus card.
- Whose turn is it?

2260
01:18:01,240 --> 01:18:02,480
- Can I go?
- Sure.

2261
01:18:02,550 --> 01:18:05,850
I'll pick an uncertain number.

2262
01:18:05,850 --> 01:18:08,590
- Lucky...
- Seven?

2263
01:18:08,590 --> 01:18:10,610
- Okay.
- Number 22.

2264
01:18:10,610 --> 01:18:12,310
(Jae Suk picked number 7,
and Haha picked number 22.)

2265
01:18:12,310 --> 01:18:13,420
This one.

2266
01:18:14,260 --> 01:18:15,950
- All right. 10 dollars.
- I knew it.

2267
01:18:16,090 --> 01:18:18,320
- 10 dollars.
- Why is it all the same?

2268
01:18:18,320 --> 01:18:19,800
- That's all there is.
- That's interesting.

2269
01:18:19,800 --> 01:18:21,190
Haha has minus 10 dollars now.

2270
01:18:21,190 --> 01:18:23,230
There are still switch
and double chances in the good zone.

2271
01:18:23,230 --> 01:18:25,390
- Was this our last chance?
- Yes, it was.

2272
01:18:25,390 --> 01:18:27,140
Hae Sun and Kwang Soo,

2273
01:18:27,140 --> 01:18:28,440
- go first.
- Of course.

2274
01:18:28,440 --> 01:18:32,140
There are blue ones too, right?
There's some left.

2275
01:18:32,140 --> 01:18:34,340
There are five good cards left.

2276
01:18:34,340 --> 01:18:35,380
Five?

2277
01:18:35,380 --> 01:18:38,020
If you pick a good one,
you'll be first place.

2278
01:18:38,020 --> 01:18:39,480
- True.
- There are many bad ones.

2279
01:18:39,480 --> 01:18:41,070
Hae Sun is currently
in second place.

2280
01:18:41,070 --> 01:18:42,220
- Exactly.
- I want first place.

2281
01:18:42,220 --> 01:18:43,440
You have to pick a good one.

2282
01:18:43,520 --> 01:18:44,560
Help me.

2283
01:18:44,560 --> 01:18:46,220
As long as it's less than
minus five.

2284
01:18:46,220 --> 01:18:47,520
- No.
- Or plus.

2285
01:18:47,590 --> 01:18:48,820
- She got it.
- Lucky seven.

2286
01:18:48,820 --> 01:18:50,890
- She got it.
- I don't have a good feeling.

2287
01:18:50,890 --> 01:18:52,930
It's going to be really bad.

2288
01:18:52,930 --> 01:18:54,350
It's going to be minus 15.

2289
01:18:54,800 --> 01:18:56,630
- Right?
- Oh, dear.

2290
01:18:56,690 --> 01:18:58,060
Minus 70 dollars.

2291
01:18:58,060 --> 01:18:59,600
(Minus 70 dollars)

2292
01:18:59,890 --> 01:19:01,810
- Jae Suk is in second place now.
- I told you.

2293
01:19:01,940 --> 01:19:04,440
- I'll pick this one then.
- Oh, gosh.

2294
01:19:04,440 --> 01:19:05,980
- Second place gets a prize too.
- Really?

2295
01:19:05,980 --> 01:19:07,310
1st and 2nd places.

2296
01:19:07,310 --> 01:19:09,680
- Kwang Soo.
- There has to be a good one here.

2297
01:19:09,680 --> 01:19:11,420
We didn't open any of them.

2298
01:19:11,420 --> 01:19:13,070
- I hope you get 200 dollars.
- I pick number 19.

2299
01:19:13,070 --> 01:19:14,140
Number 10.

2300
01:19:14,140 --> 01:19:15,310
(Kwang Soo picked number 19,
and Se Chan picked number 10.)

2301
01:19:15,310 --> 01:19:16,440
1, 2, 3.

2302
01:19:16,440 --> 01:19:18,420
(Kwang Soo gets plus 50 dollars,
and Se Chan gets minus 30 dollars.)

2303
01:19:18,420 --> 01:19:19,760
- 30 dollars?
- 50 dollars.

2304
01:19:19,760 --> 01:19:20,890
Okay, nice.

2305
01:19:21,090 --> 01:19:22,430
Okay, I won.

2306
01:19:22,430 --> 01:19:23,690
Minus 30 dollars.

2307
01:19:23,690 --> 01:19:26,150
(10th place Jong Kook or 9th place
So Min is likely last place.)

2308
01:19:26,150 --> 01:19:28,390
Shouldn't there be a plus
next to a minus?

2309
01:19:28,390 --> 01:19:30,020
- True.
- Like this one?

2310
01:19:30,020 --> 01:19:32,230
Suk Jin,
I was going to pick number nine.

2311
01:19:33,060 --> 01:19:35,810
- Okay, go.
- He has to lose for me to win.

2312
01:19:35,970 --> 01:19:38,070
- I'm fine...
- I hope it's red.

2313
01:19:38,070 --> 01:19:39,770
- as long as I'm not last place.
- Let's go.

2314
01:19:39,900 --> 01:19:41,810
(Switch chance)

2315
01:19:41,810 --> 01:19:43,070
(Switch chance?)

2316
01:19:43,070 --> 01:19:44,140
- What?
- Switch chance?

2317
01:19:44,200 --> 01:19:46,350
- Gosh, what's that?
- What? What's this?

2318
01:19:47,110 --> 01:19:48,920
(Suk Jin picked...)

2319
01:19:48,920 --> 01:19:51,350
(the switch chance.)

2320
01:19:51,350 --> 01:19:52,980
- What's this?
- You picked the switch chance,

2321
01:19:52,980 --> 01:19:56,520
so you'll switch with somebody
excluding yourself.

2322
01:19:56,520 --> 01:19:58,690
(He'll pick a random name
and switch the amounts with them.)

2323
01:19:58,690 --> 01:20:00,390
You'll pick excluding yourself.

2324
01:20:00,890 --> 01:20:02,600
He might pick Jong Kook then.

2325
01:20:02,630 --> 01:20:03,770
That's possible.

2326
01:20:05,770 --> 01:20:07,470
This is not good then.

2327
01:20:07,670 --> 01:20:09,100
He might pick me?

2328
01:20:09,200 --> 01:20:10,530
This is not good.

2329
01:20:10,530 --> 01:20:11,980
He might save me.

2330
01:20:11,980 --> 01:20:14,200
- How did I pick this?
- I have hope for the first time.

2331
01:20:14,200 --> 01:20:16,570
I wanted to pick something stable.

2332
01:20:16,570 --> 01:20:19,020
If you pick Jong Kook,
that would be insane.

2333
01:20:19,180 --> 01:20:20,940
I hope you pick me or So Min.

2334
01:20:20,940 --> 01:20:22,850
Please pick me.

2335
01:20:22,850 --> 01:20:24,440
It's because of the goblin's club.

2336
01:20:24,440 --> 01:20:25,560
Mr. Club.

2337
01:20:25,560 --> 01:20:26,650
Mr. Goblin.

2338
01:20:26,650 --> 01:20:28,280
(Goblin Suk Jin is sad
because he messed up his story.)

2339
01:20:28,280 --> 01:20:29,350
I don't know!

2340
01:20:29,350 --> 01:20:30,520
- I picked a random one.
- I hope it's me.

2341
01:20:30,520 --> 01:20:32,060
Jong Kook.

2342
01:20:32,060 --> 01:20:34,390
- I'm fine...
- Jong Kook.

2343
01:20:34,390 --> 01:20:36,130
as long as
it's not Jong Kook or So Min.

2344
01:20:36,230 --> 01:20:37,820
If it's 1st or 2nd place,
it'd be amazing.

2345
01:20:37,820 --> 01:20:39,300
Jong Kook.

2346
01:20:39,300 --> 01:20:41,400
- As long as it's not those two.
- Right. What are the chances?

2347
01:20:41,400 --> 01:20:42,440
One...

2348
01:20:42,770 --> 01:20:45,880
(Will he end up switching
with either of the last two...)

2349
01:20:45,880 --> 01:20:48,570
(or dramatically win a prize?)

2350
01:20:48,570 --> 01:20:49,640
2, 3.

2351
01:20:49,640 --> 01:20:52,180
(Yoo Jae Suk!)

2352
01:20:52,180 --> 01:20:53,380
- It's Jae Suk.
- Three.

2353
01:20:53,380 --> 01:20:54,940
(7th place Suk Jin switches with
2nd place Jae Suk.)

2354
01:20:54,940 --> 01:20:56,220
(Their places switch.)

2355
01:20:56,220 --> 01:20:58,150
You're in second place now.

2356
01:20:59,720 --> 01:21:01,190
- Am I in second place?
- That's not good.

2357
01:21:01,190 --> 01:21:02,820
- I'm in second place.
- You win a prize.

2358
01:21:03,480 --> 01:21:04,850
- This is the worst.
- You're in trouble.

2359
01:21:04,850 --> 01:21:06,950
- That was insane.
- It depends on Jong Kook.

2360
01:21:07,730 --> 01:21:09,320
This is the worst.

2361
01:21:09,390 --> 01:21:11,530
- I have no way to move up.
- Really?

2362
01:21:11,530 --> 01:21:13,190
What if you get plus 10?

2363
01:21:13,600 --> 01:21:16,360
- There's plus 100 dollars.
- There is?

2364
01:21:16,360 --> 01:21:19,030
- There is?
- If you pick plus 100 dollars,

2365
01:21:19,030 --> 01:21:20,200
you'll be in seventh place.

2366
01:21:20,600 --> 01:21:21,740
- Really?
- True.

2367
01:21:21,740 --> 01:21:24,510
If you pick plus 100 dollars,
So Min and Se Chan will be in last.

2368
01:21:24,510 --> 01:21:26,440
- Really? Will I survive?
- Is it not Jae Suk?

2369
01:21:26,440 --> 01:21:27,850
- Is it Se Chan and So Min?
- Yes.

2370
01:21:28,390 --> 01:21:29,440
Really?

2371
01:21:30,590 --> 01:21:32,110
It won't be easy though.

2372
01:21:32,110 --> 01:21:33,190
(8th place Se Chan has minus 90,
and 9th place So Min has minus 110.)

2373
01:21:33,190 --> 01:21:35,090
Stop following me.

2374
01:21:35,090 --> 01:21:36,350
I pick number five.

2375
01:21:36,890 --> 01:21:38,320
- It's not easy to get plus 100.
- What is it?

2376
01:21:38,320 --> 01:21:39,450
Number five.

2377
01:21:39,450 --> 01:21:40,520
(Will Jong Kook pick
plus 100 dollars...)

2378
01:21:40,520 --> 01:21:43,560
(and avoid the penalty?)

2379
01:21:45,060 --> 01:21:47,530
(50 dollars)

2380
01:21:47,530 --> 01:21:48,940
That's a lot.

2381
01:21:50,030 --> 01:21:51,200
Your total is close to 100 dollars.

2382
01:21:51,340 --> 01:21:52,640
That was a lot.

2383
01:21:52,880 --> 01:21:54,340
Only if I was lucky earlier.

2384
01:21:54,340 --> 01:21:55,740
- That was a lot.
- It's too bad.

2385
01:21:55,740 --> 01:21:56,850
50 dollars.

2386
01:21:56,850 --> 01:21:58,740
(So Min and Jong Kook will
receive the penalty!)

2387
01:21:58,850 --> 01:22:01,440
Jong Ok and Suk Jin got
1st and 2nd places.

2388
01:22:01,440 --> 01:22:03,020
You get the R rings.

2389
01:22:03,020 --> 01:22:04,720
- They get R rings?
- Thank you.

2390
01:22:05,650 --> 01:22:07,020
It's been a while seeing those.

2391
01:22:07,220 --> 01:22:08,260
(She's satisfied and happy.)

2392
01:22:08,260 --> 01:22:09,930
You usually...

2393
01:22:09,930 --> 01:22:12,430
I hope "Innocence" does well.

2394
01:22:12,430 --> 01:22:14,060
- This is for Hae Sun.
- It's okay.

2395
01:22:14,520 --> 01:22:15,600
(This is the 1st time in 10 years
he's done something heartwarming.)

2396
01:22:15,600 --> 01:22:17,190
I've never seen him do this
in 10 years.

2397
01:22:17,190 --> 01:22:18,640
Thank you.

2398
01:22:18,690 --> 01:22:22,060
Everything is working out for him
this year.

2399
01:22:22,060 --> 01:22:24,030
Along that line,

2400
01:22:24,140 --> 01:22:25,810
can the two of you say a few words?

2401
01:22:25,810 --> 01:22:26,880
Right.

2402
01:22:28,640 --> 01:22:30,050
Jong Ok, say a few words.

2403
01:22:31,310 --> 01:22:32,420
- I was looking at my ring.
- Stop looking at it.

2404
01:22:32,420 --> 01:22:34,440
I fell in love with this ring.

2405
01:22:34,890 --> 01:22:37,550
Thank you for treating us so nicely.

2406
01:22:38,480 --> 01:22:39,950
It was fun having you.

2407
01:22:40,110 --> 01:22:41,890
- I hope your movie "Innocence"...
- Thank you.

2408
01:22:41,890 --> 01:22:44,800
- is widely loved.
- Thank you.

2409
01:22:44,800 --> 01:22:46,430
- Let's go, "Intruder."
- Let's go, "Intruder."

2410
01:22:46,430 --> 01:22:48,560
"You Can Call Me
When You Are Drunk,"

2411
01:22:48,630 --> 01:22:49,770
- let's go!
- Let's go!

2412
01:22:49,770 --> 01:22:51,300
(That's nice.)

2413
01:22:51,300 --> 01:22:54,490
Great. 1, 2, 3.

2414
01:22:55,170 --> 01:22:57,510
(Whipped cream is launched.)

2415
01:22:57,860 --> 01:22:59,600
Goodness.

2416
01:23:00,640 --> 01:23:01,640
Look at So Min.

2417
01:23:01,640 --> 01:23:02,700
(Who is this?)

2418
01:23:02,700 --> 01:23:03,810
- Me?
- Jong Kook.

2419
01:23:03,810 --> 01:23:06,240
- I'm bleeding.
- That was strong.

2420
01:23:06,270 --> 01:23:07,380
I know.

2421
01:23:07,380 --> 01:23:08,720
Great work.

2422
01:23:08,720 --> 01:23:11,110
- Great work everyone.
- Great work everyone.

2423
01:23:12,350 --> 01:23:14,480
(Na Eun of April and
Yura of Girl's Day are here.)

2424
01:23:14,590 --> 01:23:17,390
(Emotional actor Kang Tae Oh and
trot angel Kim Na Hee show synergy.)

2425
01:23:17,950 --> 01:23:19,430
(Se Chan and Yura show
new chemistry.)

2426
01:23:19,430 --> 01:23:21,150
(So Min bans dating.)

2427
01:23:21,630 --> 01:23:23,820
(However,)

2428
01:23:23,820 --> 01:23:27,060
(they spot suspicious movements
when they open the door.)

2429
01:23:27,060 --> 01:23:29,030
(They must brace themselves!)

2430
01:23:29,940 --> 01:23:31,530
(A single mistake...)

2431
01:23:31,530 --> 01:23:34,010
(leads to a deadly result.)

2432
01:23:34,010 --> 01:23:35,740
I won't sit back and watch
this time.

2433
01:23:35,740 --> 01:23:37,640
(If you behave impulsively,)

2434
01:23:37,640 --> 01:23:39,850
(your suffering doubles
without question.)

2435
01:23:39,850 --> 01:23:42,780
(Everybody turns cruel.)

2436
01:23:43,610 --> 01:23:47,020
(There's only one word
that will save you.)

2437
01:23:47,020 --> 01:23:48,760
(And there's the die of fate!)

2438
01:23:49,090 --> 01:23:52,100
(If you hesitate,
punishment awaits.)

2439
01:23:52,100 --> 01:23:53,600
What are you doing? What's wrong?

2440
01:23:53,600 --> 01:23:54,650
(There's no mercy.)

2441
01:23:54,650 --> 01:23:56,470
(Who's the hidden mastermind?)

2442
01:23:56,470 --> 01:23:58,230
(Fate Betting Race:
Throw Double or Nothing)
