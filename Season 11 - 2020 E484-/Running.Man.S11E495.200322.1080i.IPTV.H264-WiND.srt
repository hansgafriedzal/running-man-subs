1
00:00:06,220 --> 00:00:09,090
(A day in March that feels
like spring is around the corner)

2
00:00:09,310 --> 00:00:11,060
- What's all this?
- My gosh.

3
00:00:11,060 --> 00:00:12,760
- What is all this?
- Gosh, that's going on?

4
00:00:12,760 --> 00:00:14,820
This is so nice.

5
00:00:14,820 --> 00:00:16,560
Wait. What's with the violin?

6
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:18,320
- What is this?
- There's a red carpet.

7
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:20,130
- Hello.
- Hello.

8
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:23,170
(The microphone wearing ceremony
for excellent members?)

9
00:00:23,170 --> 00:00:24,740
- Hello.
- Hello.

10
00:00:24,740 --> 00:00:26,830
The microphone wearing ceremony
for excellent members?

11
00:00:26,830 --> 00:00:29,280
Does that mean
I'm not an excellent member?

12
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:32,940
Suk Jin, you can stand on
the straw mat.

13
00:00:32,980 --> 00:00:34,940
You should be here, Suk Jin.

14
00:00:35,010 --> 00:00:36,810
I can't believe this.

15
00:00:36,810 --> 00:00:38,510
- Why on a straw mat...
- Go to the straw mat.

16
00:00:38,510 --> 00:00:40,620
(The reason Suk Jin gets
pushed to the straw mat is...)

17
00:00:41,720 --> 00:00:45,050
(He took last place last week,
so he was decided to get a penalty.)

18
00:00:45,690 --> 00:00:50,900
(He's supposed to shoot
the intro without a microphone.)

19
00:00:50,900 --> 00:00:52,300
Should I be here?

20
00:00:53,070 --> 00:00:54,370
Gosh, this is so...

21
00:00:54,430 --> 00:00:55,940
What is going on? This is like...

22
00:00:56,500 --> 00:00:58,610
(Just sit on the ground.)

23
00:00:58,760 --> 00:01:02,400
It's just about a microphone.
Why do I not get a chair?

24
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:04,440
I'm supposed to do this
only without a microphone.

25
00:01:04,440 --> 00:01:06,770
- This is so nice.
- Why would you do that?

26
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:08,510
Gosh, they're bringing something in.

27
00:01:08,510 --> 00:01:10,880
Suk Jin should dress up
like a criminal then.

28
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:13,150
(Something is being served
on a silver platter.)

29
00:01:13,150 --> 00:01:14,820
- This isn't funny.
- Thank you.

30
00:01:14,820 --> 00:01:18,020
(The thing
on the silver platter is...)

31
00:01:18,020 --> 00:01:20,130
Now we should talk.

32
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:22,290
We can talk now.

33
00:01:22,290 --> 00:01:24,160
We will put them on you
if you stay seated.

34
00:01:24,160 --> 00:01:25,770
- Will you put this on me?
- Yes.

35
00:01:25,770 --> 00:01:27,730
I haven't been
treated like this before.

36
00:01:27,730 --> 00:01:30,240
It feels so awkward. I just
got on my knees before I knew it.

37
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:31,240
Thank you.

38
00:01:31,240 --> 00:01:33,430
- What's going on?
- The audio director usually says,

39
00:01:33,540 --> 00:01:35,510
"Please put on the microphone."

40
00:01:35,510 --> 00:01:38,070
She usually sounds very chic,
but she got on one knee today.

41
00:01:38,180 --> 00:01:39,850
I like the system here.

42
00:01:39,850 --> 00:01:41,350
What should I do?

43
00:01:42,020 --> 00:01:43,480
Can you even hear me?

44
00:01:43,850 --> 00:01:45,020
You can't?

45
00:01:45,020 --> 00:01:46,410
Do you hear me or not?

46
00:01:46,410 --> 00:01:48,550
- Why?
- They can't hear you, Suk Jin.

47
00:01:48,990 --> 00:01:51,550
They can't hear my voice.

48
00:01:52,350 --> 00:01:55,020
They don't even look at Suk Jin.

49
00:01:55,850 --> 00:01:57,050
I shouldn't look at him.

50
00:01:57,850 --> 00:01:59,630
(Haha looks around
right at the moment.)

51
00:01:59,630 --> 00:02:01,430
(He drops something.)

52
00:02:01,430 --> 00:02:02,870
(A macaroon)

53
00:02:02,870 --> 00:02:04,430
(Humiliated)

54
00:02:05,270 --> 00:02:07,460
He'll ask for more.
You can't do that already.

55
00:02:08,540 --> 00:02:09,800
He's eating it already.

56
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:13,350
(After hesitating a while,)

57
00:02:13,350 --> 00:02:15,610
(he puts it in his mouth secretly.)

58
00:02:15,880 --> 00:02:16,910
My gosh.

59
00:02:16,910 --> 00:02:19,440
(He tries to keep his last pride.)

60
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:20,540
Look at Suk Jin.

61
00:02:20,540 --> 00:02:22,380
He picked it up and ate it.

62
00:02:22,450 --> 00:02:23,980
- You can't do that.
- Gosh, Suk Jin.

63
00:02:23,980 --> 00:02:25,760
Who told you to share
your food with Suk Jin?

64
00:02:26,420 --> 00:02:28,030
Don't give it to him.

65
00:02:28,030 --> 00:02:30,000
- Haha did it.
- You shouldn't do that.

66
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,190
Look at him.

67
00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:33,920
- He's eating it.
- Look at him.

68
00:02:34,630 --> 00:02:38,730
All right. We have
pleasant guests for today.

69
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:40,440
I will bring them in.

70
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:41,760
Who are they?

71
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:43,040
(The black toes
look somewhat familiar.)

72
00:02:43,380 --> 00:02:45,640
- This music is...
- It's "I've missed you, my friend."

73
00:02:48,010 --> 00:02:49,140
My gosh.

74
00:02:49,140 --> 00:02:51,410
(Is he the guy we know?)

75
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:55,660
(He's here.)

76
00:02:55,660 --> 00:02:57,160
- Kwang Soo.
- Kwang Soo.

77
00:02:57,350 --> 00:02:58,630
Kwang Soo!

78
00:02:58,630 --> 00:02:59,850
- Kwang Soo.
- Kwang Soo.

79
00:02:59,850 --> 00:03:01,450
(They all stand up to greet him.)

80
00:03:01,450 --> 00:03:02,760
(Emotional)

81
00:03:03,320 --> 00:03:04,500
Kwang Soo.

82
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:05,530
(Glad)

83
00:03:05,530 --> 00:03:07,790
- Gosh, he's here.
- Hello.

84
00:03:07,790 --> 00:03:09,230
- You're back.
- Hi.

85
00:03:09,230 --> 00:03:11,440
- He's here.
- Hey, Kwang Soo.

86
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:13,810
Kwang Soo. You should wear socks.

87
00:03:13,810 --> 00:03:15,340
I can't wear socks.

88
00:03:15,340 --> 00:03:16,780
Your foot must be cold.

89
00:03:16,780 --> 00:03:19,350
Kwang Soo, I've really missed you.

90
00:03:19,350 --> 00:03:21,350
I know. I've missed you too.

91
00:03:21,350 --> 00:03:24,280
(He's back with a bright smile.)

92
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:28,560
- I'm glad he can walk on crutches.
- I know.

93
00:03:29,290 --> 00:03:30,820
(He's excited to see Kwang Soo too.)

94
00:03:30,820 --> 00:03:32,030
Why are you sitting on the ground?

95
00:03:32,030 --> 00:03:33,730
(What is he doing there?)

96
00:03:33,730 --> 00:03:36,290
He took last place yesterday.
This is a penalty.

97
00:03:36,290 --> 00:03:38,350
- It's a penalty.
- He doesn't have a microphone.

98
00:03:38,530 --> 00:03:40,970
I don't need to talk to him then.

99
00:03:40,970 --> 00:03:42,440
That's right. You don't.

100
00:03:42,440 --> 00:03:45,410
Suk Jin called me a lot
when I was in the hospital.

101
00:03:45,410 --> 00:03:46,510
Really?

102
00:03:46,510 --> 00:03:49,070
He called me
right after I got surgery.

103
00:03:49,070 --> 00:03:51,780
He said he even went hiking
in a wheelchair when he was injured.

104
00:03:51,780 --> 00:03:53,250
Did he go hiking in a wheelchair?

105
00:03:53,250 --> 00:03:54,640
My mom heard it...

106
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:57,110
and said,
"Suk Jin is such an old fossil."

107
00:03:57,440 --> 00:03:59,440
He kept saying that.
"When I was your age..."

108
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:00,720
"I went hiking in a wheelchair
after my surgery."

109
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:01,720
He's so awful.

110
00:04:02,320 --> 00:04:03,720
(He's making an excuse.)

111
00:04:04,010 --> 00:04:05,730
He still sounds like that.

112
00:04:05,730 --> 00:04:09,160
And we have real guests
for today's Running Man.

113
00:04:09,160 --> 00:04:10,190
Really?

114
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:11,630
Is there someone else?

115
00:04:12,260 --> 00:04:15,600
(Who is the guest
for today's Running Man?)

116
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:17,940
- It's Daniel.
- Hello.

117
00:04:18,440 --> 00:04:19,700
Hello.

118
00:04:19,700 --> 00:04:20,910
(Kang Daniel has topped the idol
charts for 103 weeks.)

119
00:04:20,910 --> 00:04:22,080
(Kang Daniel is ranked 1st
before his comeback.)

120
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:27,040
(He shows his sexy charm on stage.)

121
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:32,240
(And he shows his cute
and naive charm on Running Man.)

122
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:33,540
He's getting more handsome.

123
00:04:33,540 --> 00:04:35,660
You've become a lot cooler.

124
00:04:35,660 --> 00:04:37,410
- Come here.
- Daniel!

125
00:04:37,410 --> 00:04:38,730
- Welcome.
- Wow.

126
00:04:38,730 --> 00:04:39,790
(They react in totally
different ways to him.)

127
00:04:40,390 --> 00:04:44,400
Daniel, please tell us
how you've been doing.

128
00:04:44,490 --> 00:04:47,360
I've been getting ready
to make my comeback.

129
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:48,900
- I see.
- Thank you...

130
00:04:48,900 --> 00:04:51,100
for having me here again
after a long time.

131
00:04:51,100 --> 00:04:53,560
We and a lot of fans
have waited for your comeback.

132
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:55,230
Welcome, Daniel.

133
00:04:55,540 --> 00:04:56,980
Thank you.

134
00:04:57,230 --> 00:04:58,540
(I'm here too.)

135
00:04:58,540 --> 00:05:00,980
- Daniel, can you sing our new song?
- Sure.

136
00:05:00,980 --> 00:05:03,040
- Please give him a big hand.
- I'll show you a little.

137
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:04,280
I'm excited.

138
00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:05,410
(Kang Daniel's comeback is
revealed in Running Man.)

139
00:05:06,450 --> 00:05:09,480
(His new song, "2U" will be
released on March 24.)

140
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:13,960
His steps are so light.

141
00:05:13,960 --> 00:05:16,750
(The groovy beats and dance
are perfect for warm spring.)

142
00:05:17,490 --> 00:05:18,660
He's so good.

143
00:05:19,830 --> 00:05:21,060
This is Kang Daniel's dance.

144
00:05:21,060 --> 00:05:22,360
(It's something they can
rarely see in Running Man.)

145
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:24,230
- His steps are so light.
- It's so light.

146
00:05:24,340 --> 00:05:25,800
He's so nimble.

147
00:05:28,670 --> 00:05:30,100
- My gosh.
- I'm so jealous.

148
00:05:30,780 --> 00:05:32,370
(The ending makes
people's hearts flutter.)

149
00:05:32,370 --> 00:05:33,480
This is it.

150
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:34,910
(The ending makes
people's hearts flutter.)

151
00:05:35,540 --> 00:05:36,670
<i>Tell me</i>

152
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:39,150
(Hello?)

153
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:42,750
(They are just acting up.)

154
00:05:42,750 --> 00:05:43,910
What was that, Suk Jin?

155
00:05:44,460 --> 00:05:46,030
(Would you like some makgeolli?)

156
00:05:46,530 --> 00:05:47,660
(Today's race begins in earnest.)

157
00:05:47,660 --> 00:05:48,790
Today,

158
00:05:48,790 --> 00:05:51,530
we will have a family race
where three moms will be captains.

159
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:52,860
- Are there moms?
- Moms?

160
00:05:52,860 --> 00:05:55,160
We will have three guests
who have shown...

161
00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:56,290
impressive acting as a mom.

162
00:05:56,970 --> 00:05:58,640
And they are waiting
in each room of the building.

163
00:05:58,640 --> 00:05:59,860
Really?

164
00:05:59,860 --> 00:06:01,040
- Moms.
- Really?

165
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:04,430
The door of each room says
what kind of child they want.

166
00:06:04,910 --> 00:06:08,410
If you think it applies to you,
you can enter and complete a family.

167
00:06:09,350 --> 00:06:11,410
If there are too many children
in a room,

168
00:06:11,580 --> 00:06:14,040
or you don't like the mom you chose,

169
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:15,720
- When I don't like my mom?
- you can move to another room.

170
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:16,960
We can move to another room.

171
00:06:16,980 --> 00:06:19,960
Jae Suk, Haha, and Kwang Soo.

172
00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:22,200
- Go to your moms first.
- Okay.

173
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:24,550
- Can we go now?
- Yes. This way, please.

174
00:06:26,530 --> 00:06:27,700
Wait.

175
00:06:27,700 --> 00:06:29,660
(Jae Suk, Haha, and Kwang Soo are
here to see their moms.)

176
00:06:29,660 --> 00:06:31,560
- Gosh, this is...
- Hang on.

177
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:33,060
(The moms wrote
about the children they want.)

178
00:06:33,060 --> 00:06:34,430
"A good-looking child"?

179
00:06:34,710 --> 00:06:35,980
"A child with a good appetite"?

180
00:06:36,140 --> 00:06:37,500
I do have a good appetite.

181
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:38,950
Good-looking?

182
00:06:38,950 --> 00:06:40,100
My looks...

183
00:06:40,780 --> 00:06:42,520
To be honest,
I'm not so good-looking.

184
00:06:42,580 --> 00:06:43,780
But I'm not that bad.

185
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:49,460
- I don't even want to answer that.
- Since when?

186
00:06:49,460 --> 00:06:51,980
I know that
I don't have great looks.

187
00:06:52,590 --> 00:06:55,120
- But...
- I don't know what to say.

188
00:06:55,350 --> 00:06:56,550
Why does he seem so confident?

189
00:06:56,550 --> 00:06:58,330
You don't belong to any room.

190
00:06:58,330 --> 00:07:00,700
You're just like Se Chan.

191
00:07:01,030 --> 00:07:02,540
You're Se Chan's level.

192
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:04,660
I can say you are smart.

193
00:07:04,790 --> 00:07:06,300
- Me?
- You are smart.

194
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:08,340
Let's say you're smart,
and you have a good appetite.

195
00:07:08,340 --> 00:07:09,410
Kwang Soo, which room
are you going to?

196
00:07:09,410 --> 00:07:10,710
I'm going to Room 101.

197
00:07:10,710 --> 00:07:11,840
What's Room 101?

198
00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:13,740
It's good looks.

199
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:15,740
- He's trying to be funny.
- Haha.

200
00:07:15,740 --> 00:07:17,540
- He should be funny.
- What are you talking about?

201
00:07:17,780 --> 00:07:19,740
I will let you
choose first, Kwang Soo.

202
00:07:19,740 --> 00:07:21,390
You can be funny all you want.

203
00:07:21,390 --> 00:07:22,480
- Okay.
- If I have to choose one thing...

204
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:24,160
Okay. Just go.

205
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:25,730
(Who are the moms
in the three different rooms?)

206
00:07:25,730 --> 00:07:28,050
(A good-looking child)

207
00:07:28,050 --> 00:07:30,030
I want Jae Suk to be here.

208
00:07:30,250 --> 00:07:32,230
What if I burst into laughter?

209
00:07:32,770 --> 00:07:34,620
(Where should I go?)

210
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:37,100
- Where should I go?
- Then...

211
00:07:37,100 --> 00:07:38,490
should I go to the room
as a child with a good appetite?

212
00:07:38,490 --> 00:07:39,910
(Kwang Soo goes to Room 101 where
the mom wants a good-looking child.)

213
00:07:41,340 --> 00:07:44,080
(Cautious)

214
00:07:45,140 --> 00:07:46,670
- Gosh, hello.
- Welcome.

215
00:07:46,670 --> 00:07:48,300
(Whose voice is this?)

216
00:07:48,300 --> 00:07:50,520
- Pardon?
- Come on in.

217
00:07:50,520 --> 00:07:51,740
Are you alone?

218
00:07:52,610 --> 00:07:53,740
(She has a charismatic voice.)

219
00:07:53,740 --> 00:07:55,980
(Mom Hwang Young Hee)

220
00:07:55,980 --> 00:07:57,390
What about Dong Sik?

221
00:07:57,790 --> 00:08:00,480
(She can show
incredible maternal love...)

222
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:04,050
(and also pull off a strong mother.)

223
00:08:04,750 --> 00:08:06,700
- Come on in.
- Okay. I'm on my way.

224
00:08:06,700 --> 00:08:07,920
(She sounds charismatic
scolding him.)

225
00:08:09,230 --> 00:08:10,970
(This mom is too scary.
I should go to another room.)

226
00:08:11,140 --> 00:08:12,710
I'm sorry, but can you help me?

227
00:08:12,860 --> 00:08:14,710
You're injured for real.

228
00:08:15,540 --> 00:08:16,670
My gosh.

229
00:08:16,780 --> 00:08:18,040
When did you get hurt?

230
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:19,210
You sound like a real mom.

231
00:08:19,210 --> 00:08:20,210
- Sure.
- Thank you.

232
00:08:20,300 --> 00:08:22,520
Jae Suk. You're the smart one.

233
00:08:22,520 --> 00:08:23,580
You should go to
the Intelligent Room.

234
00:08:23,580 --> 00:08:25,310
I'm afraid to go there.

235
00:08:25,590 --> 00:08:27,110
Which one of us is smarter here?

236
00:08:27,110 --> 00:08:28,390
You even know a lot of idioms.

237
00:08:28,410 --> 00:08:30,110
Knowing idioms doesn't mean smart.

238
00:08:30,110 --> 00:08:31,180
You're the smart one here.

239
00:08:31,180 --> 00:08:33,750
- Get off me.
- I should go to this room.

240
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:35,290
I'm the only one
who can be here.

241
00:08:35,390 --> 00:08:37,150
(She's waiting for children
with a good appetite.)

242
00:08:37,150 --> 00:08:38,350
(Mom Lee Il Hwa)

243
00:08:38,350 --> 00:08:40,860
- Jae Suk. Come on in.
- It's Il Hwa.

244
00:08:41,990 --> 00:08:45,570
(She's a mom with an open hand.)

245
00:08:45,570 --> 00:08:49,940
(She's also generous
when it comes to acting.)

246
00:08:49,940 --> 00:08:51,310
Come on in.

247
00:08:51,810 --> 00:08:53,240
- Il Hwa.
- Yes.

248
00:08:53,310 --> 00:08:54,770
- What are you doing?
- Are you hungry?

249
00:08:54,770 --> 00:08:56,350
Yes. What are you doing here?

250
00:08:56,350 --> 00:08:57,510
Have a seat.

251
00:08:57,580 --> 00:08:59,640
Gosh, why are you making gimbap?

252
00:09:00,740 --> 00:09:02,190
You know what?

253
00:09:02,590 --> 00:09:05,320
I don't know what
other moms are like,

254
00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:06,780
but my mom is the prettiest one.

255
00:09:07,780 --> 00:09:09,930
I think my mom is the best.

256
00:09:09,930 --> 00:09:11,650
(Mom Il Hwa is like a shy girl.)

257
00:09:12,260 --> 00:09:13,860
I should go to the Intelligent Room.

258
00:09:14,330 --> 00:09:17,100
Actually, I'm quite intelligent.

259
00:09:17,100 --> 00:09:19,670
(Who's the mom
waiting for a smart child?)

260
00:09:20,030 --> 00:09:21,810
Mi Sun. Gosh.

261
00:09:21,940 --> 00:09:23,000
I mean, Mom.

262
00:09:23,210 --> 00:09:25,030
Where are other guys?
Why are you alone?

263
00:09:25,030 --> 00:09:26,210
(Mom Park Mi Sun
looks like a mom in reality.)

264
00:09:27,050 --> 00:09:29,180
(She was Mi Dal's mom
in "Soonpoong Clinic.")

265
00:09:29,180 --> 00:09:32,590
(And she's a famous comedian,
Park Mi Sun.)

266
00:09:32,950 --> 00:09:34,110
Have a seat.

267
00:09:34,590 --> 00:09:37,090
Gosh, this is
like "Soonpoong Clinic."

268
00:09:37,090 --> 00:09:38,350
- Come in and have a seat.
- Okay.

269
00:09:38,750 --> 00:09:40,960
- Why are you alone.
- One went to the Good-looking Room.

270
00:09:41,780 --> 00:09:44,700
- Have you been doing well?
- This is no laughing matter.

271
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:47,620
My gosh. You seem so serious.

272
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:51,100
Do you think
this report card is a joke?

273
00:09:51,100 --> 00:09:53,970
(What is she talking about
a report card all of a sudden?)

274
00:09:54,730 --> 00:09:56,480
- Hello.
- Hello.

275
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:57,810
- Are you shooting us now?
- Yes.

276
00:09:57,810 --> 00:09:59,000
Are we shooting something?

277
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,400
The camera is on.

278
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:03,510
This is a family race where
three moms are the captains.

279
00:10:03,510 --> 00:10:05,780
You are the moms
and the captains of each team.

280
00:10:06,050 --> 00:10:08,320
Children will go into
the rooms they want...

281
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:09,880
and join your skit.

282
00:10:09,880 --> 00:10:13,430
Only the children who complete your
secret mission can be your team.

283
00:10:13,930 --> 00:10:16,020
Young Hee's mission is
I take after Mom,

284
00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:18,490
I'm sick and tired of how I look,
and I do the splits over 2m.

285
00:10:18,990 --> 00:10:20,990
And Mi Sun's mission is
I take after Lee Bong Won,

286
00:10:20,990 --> 00:10:23,070
How can love change?,
and doing mental calculations.

287
00:10:23,230 --> 00:10:25,200
Il Hwa's mission is
this is how it should taste,

288
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:26,340
doing a double thumbs up,

289
00:10:26,340 --> 00:10:28,130
and having ice cream
covered in sesame oil.

290
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:31,940
As soon as you complete
a family of four, you get a benefit.

291
00:10:31,940 --> 00:10:34,850
So you should lead your children
to say or do your missions.

292
00:10:35,450 --> 00:10:37,770
Can we name the children we want
all at the same time?

293
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:39,240
- Haha.
- Yoo Jae Suk.

294
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:42,220
I want Suk Jin.

295
00:10:42,220 --> 00:10:44,590
- Suk Jin?
- Is he older than me?

296
00:10:44,590 --> 00:10:46,250
How old is he?

297
00:10:46,250 --> 00:10:47,460
He's one year older than me.

298
00:10:48,460 --> 00:10:49,990
I don't want him.

299
00:10:50,150 --> 00:10:51,930
(She doesn't want a son
who's older than her.)

300
00:10:52,250 --> 00:10:56,760
(The moms start their skits
to get their children.)

301
00:10:57,340 --> 00:10:58,630
You know what?

302
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,170
If you studied
according to my plans,

303
00:11:01,170 --> 00:11:04,730
your grades would've been good
enough for the Ivy League.

304
00:11:04,730 --> 00:11:05,950
How is this possible?

305
00:11:06,180 --> 00:11:08,680
You placed at the top of your class
during the midterm.

306
00:11:08,870 --> 00:11:10,680
But you took 200th place
in the finals.

307
00:11:10,680 --> 00:11:12,420
Can you believe this?

308
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:15,010
- My life...
- Are you still...

309
00:11:15,010 --> 00:11:16,780
seeing that wench?

310
00:11:16,780 --> 00:11:18,320
I told you not to date her.

311
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:21,690
I said you can date good girls
once you go to college.

312
00:11:21,690 --> 00:11:23,100
Enough of college talk.

313
00:11:23,700 --> 00:11:25,120
That's enough. Stop it.

314
00:11:25,930 --> 00:11:27,930
What's your problem?

315
00:11:27,930 --> 00:11:30,670
We've already talked about this.

316
00:11:30,730 --> 00:11:32,340
You should break up with her.

317
00:11:32,340 --> 00:11:33,400
(You should break up with her.)

318
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:34,730
Mom, I have three children.

319
00:11:36,340 --> 00:11:37,600
You have three children already?

320
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:39,310
(Speechless)

321
00:11:39,310 --> 00:11:41,180
My gosh. I can't believe this.

322
00:11:41,180 --> 00:11:44,240
What should I do with him?

323
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:46,350
You should focus on your studies.

324
00:11:46,350 --> 00:11:48,220
Everything has its time.

325
00:11:48,220 --> 00:11:49,720
What's your problem?
Where did you get that from?

326
00:11:50,150 --> 00:11:51,510
Who do you take after?

327
00:11:51,690 --> 00:11:53,730
Lee Bong Won. It's Lee Bong Won!

328
00:11:53,730 --> 00:11:55,430
(Lee Bong Won!)

329
00:11:55,430 --> 00:11:56,650
(It's done.)

330
00:11:56,650 --> 00:11:57,960
Haha. You succeeded.

331
00:11:57,960 --> 00:11:59,390
- Did I succeed?
- Yes.

332
00:11:59,970 --> 00:12:01,230
(What is going on?)

333
00:12:01,230 --> 00:12:02,440
Am I intelligent?

334
00:12:02,490 --> 00:12:04,860
- Did I make it?
- Obviously, you're my son.

335
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:06,570
You are my child.

336
00:12:06,630 --> 00:12:09,080
Now you can complete...

337
00:12:09,080 --> 00:12:11,710
- your family with your mom.
- Okay.

338
00:12:11,710 --> 00:12:12,950
Bring the other kids.

339
00:12:13,210 --> 00:12:14,450
Bring smart ones.

340
00:12:14,450 --> 00:12:15,580
Who do you want?

341
00:12:16,180 --> 00:12:17,420
What about Ji Suk Jin?

342
00:12:17,420 --> 00:12:18,610
Well...

343
00:12:18,610 --> 00:12:20,510
Bring him if he has nowhere to go.

344
00:12:21,420 --> 00:12:23,350
- I bet he has nowhere to go.
- Okay.

345
00:12:23,980 --> 00:12:25,720
He's a pathetic guy.

346
00:12:26,590 --> 00:12:29,150
I will give you an acting lesson.

347
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:31,850
You should be a celebrity.

348
00:12:32,490 --> 00:12:33,730
You should be a celebrity.

349
00:12:33,890 --> 00:12:35,020
- Me?
- Sure.

350
00:12:35,020 --> 00:12:36,530
You are so talented.

351
00:12:37,070 --> 00:12:38,470
You're very tall.

352
00:12:39,100 --> 00:12:41,100
- I'm...
- Because you take after your dad.

353
00:12:41,100 --> 00:12:42,230
And who did you...

354
00:12:43,180 --> 00:12:44,210
get your face from?

355
00:12:44,210 --> 00:12:46,980
(Who did you get your face from?)

356
00:12:46,980 --> 00:12:48,140
I take after you, my mom.

357
00:12:48,140 --> 00:12:49,510
That's right.

358
00:12:49,510 --> 00:12:51,450
(I take after Mom.)

359
00:12:53,740 --> 00:12:55,350
Mom. So she's my mom...

360
00:12:55,350 --> 00:12:57,380
(Young Hee's first son
is Kwang Soo.)

361
00:12:57,380 --> 00:12:59,230
- Hello, Young Hee.
- Gosh, So Min.

362
00:12:59,230 --> 00:13:00,620
- Hello.
- Come in.

363
00:13:00,690 --> 00:13:02,120
Just come on in.

364
00:13:02,250 --> 00:13:05,230
This is the Good-looking Room.
That's why I'm here.

365
00:13:05,230 --> 00:13:06,730
We have a lot of good-looking
members here, but why...

366
00:13:06,730 --> 00:13:08,300
I think you picked the wrong room.

367
00:13:08,470 --> 00:13:09,630
- Have a seat.
- You came to the wrong room.

368
00:13:09,630 --> 00:13:11,130
Hello, Young Hee.

369
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:12,530
Hello.

370
00:13:13,310 --> 00:13:15,310
Why are you making gimbap?

371
00:13:15,530 --> 00:13:17,130
You wanted to eat gimbap.

372
00:13:17,130 --> 00:13:19,600
You told me
you wanted to eat my gimbap.

373
00:13:19,810 --> 00:13:20,980
Did I?

374
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:22,450
(Jae Suk can't help
but feel confused.)

375
00:13:22,450 --> 00:13:25,240
So I made a lot of gimbap for you.

376
00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:26,320
(She's a loving mom
with giving hands.)

377
00:13:26,510 --> 00:13:28,780
- You wanted to eat gimbap.
- It has chili peppers in it.

378
00:13:28,780 --> 00:13:30,460
I know. It's very spicy.

379
00:13:30,460 --> 00:13:31,850
- I see.
- Do you like spicy food?

380
00:13:31,850 --> 00:13:33,620
You should taste it...

381
00:13:33,620 --> 00:13:36,960
- and see if it's your mom's gimbap.
- Okay.

382
00:13:36,960 --> 00:13:38,850
- Try this and tell me.
- Okay.

383
00:13:38,850 --> 00:13:39,860
(Open your mouth.)

384
00:13:39,860 --> 00:13:41,470
(Taking a big bite)

385
00:13:41,830 --> 00:13:43,700
Do you like it? Is it spicy?

386
00:13:44,570 --> 00:13:46,570
Is it what you used to eat?

387
00:13:47,340 --> 00:13:48,600
Yes, it is.

388
00:13:49,230 --> 00:13:50,530
- What?
- I must say...

389
00:13:50,530 --> 00:13:53,080
(This is how it should taste.)

390
00:13:53,080 --> 00:13:55,050
this is what I used to eat.

391
00:13:55,050 --> 00:13:57,980
(She fails her mission.)

392
00:13:57,980 --> 00:13:59,880
I stopped eating gimbap since then.

393
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:01,090
- Who is it?
- What?

394
00:14:01,280 --> 00:14:02,750
- Il Hwa.
- Hello.

395
00:14:02,750 --> 00:14:03,980
Come on in, sweetheart.

396
00:14:03,980 --> 00:14:05,090
(Come on in and have some gimbap.)

397
00:14:05,090 --> 00:14:06,250
Mom.

398
00:14:06,930 --> 00:14:08,060
Mom, what is this?

399
00:14:08,060 --> 00:14:09,830
Is it spicy gimbap?

400
00:14:09,830 --> 00:14:10,930
You know what?

401
00:14:11,490 --> 00:14:13,670
- Mom's gimbap...
- Tell me if this tastes right.

402
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:14,890
is really spicy.

403
00:14:15,520 --> 00:14:16,970
(It exceeds the limit of spiciness.)

404
00:14:16,970 --> 00:14:18,990
- Gosh, the aftertaste is so...
- Is this...

405
00:14:19,470 --> 00:14:23,130
Mom, your second son is here.
This is your second son.

406
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:24,710
- Mom.
- Look who's here.

407
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:26,870
This isn't a joke.

408
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:28,600
Come on in.

409
00:14:30,110 --> 00:14:31,980
- Gosh, this is so...
- Come have a seat.

410
00:14:31,980 --> 00:14:34,140
- I feel so comfortable around Mom.
- Me too.

411
00:14:34,140 --> 00:14:36,010
My mom is about my age.

412
00:14:36,010 --> 00:14:37,750
My mom was in "Soonpoong Clinic."

413
00:14:37,750 --> 00:14:39,520
My mom is about my age.
I'm in trouble.

414
00:14:39,520 --> 00:14:40,980
- Is she your age?
- My gosh.

415
00:14:40,980 --> 00:14:42,430
- What should I do?
- Mom.

416
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:45,120
- Should I call you Mom or Mi Sun?
- She's your mom!

417
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:46,800
- You.
- I'm sorry.

418
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:48,360
- You.
- Yes?

419
00:14:48,360 --> 00:14:51,700
Are you sure these are your grades?

420
00:14:51,700 --> 00:14:54,030
- How did we do?
- What's wrong?

421
00:14:54,260 --> 00:14:56,310
You used to be at the top
of the class.

422
00:14:56,310 --> 00:14:57,480
What's going on?

423
00:14:57,480 --> 00:14:59,370
- 200th place?
- Is this possible?

424
00:14:59,370 --> 00:15:01,180
- I used to be in 1st place.
- Our grades plummeted.

425
00:15:01,180 --> 00:15:02,580
- What happened?
- What happened?

426
00:15:02,580 --> 00:15:04,050
Why are our grades fluctuating?

427
00:15:04,050 --> 00:15:05,180
You guys are strangers to us.

428
00:15:05,180 --> 00:15:06,950
Our family never had kids like you.

429
00:15:06,950 --> 00:15:08,050
- Who are you?
- Who are you?

430
00:15:08,050 --> 00:15:09,250
- I'm...
- Why are you...

431
00:15:09,250 --> 00:15:10,590
- the firstborn?
- He's your eldest brother.

432
00:15:10,590 --> 00:15:12,060
- He is?
- He is?

433
00:15:12,620 --> 00:15:13,780
- Haha.
- Where are your manners?

434
00:15:13,780 --> 00:15:15,090
Go get the stick.

435
00:15:15,090 --> 00:15:16,350
- Yes, Mom.
- What is this?

436
00:15:16,430 --> 00:15:17,700
I'll bring one.

437
00:15:17,700 --> 00:15:19,470
(He's making the situation worse.)

438
00:15:19,470 --> 00:15:20,930
(He tells her to reproach them.)

439
00:15:20,990 --> 00:15:23,730
Especially this punk right here!

440
00:15:23,730 --> 00:15:24,800
(You need to chew him out
the most!)

441
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:26,100
- Break his legs!
- There's the stick.

442
00:15:26,100 --> 00:15:27,810
- Got it.
- Give that to me.

443
00:15:27,810 --> 00:15:29,100
There is one.

444
00:15:29,100 --> 00:15:30,840
I have somewhere to be.

445
00:15:30,840 --> 00:15:31,840
- Goodness.
- Don't let them off easy.

446
00:15:31,840 --> 00:15:34,240
Sit down. Where do you think
you're going?

447
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:35,270
- Well...
- Gosh.

448
00:15:35,270 --> 00:15:37,050
Why does the youngest
look like that?

449
00:15:37,050 --> 00:15:38,110
Am I the youngest?

450
00:15:38,110 --> 00:15:40,980
Don't you remember what I told you?

451
00:15:40,980 --> 00:15:44,320
You age if you meet too many girls.

452
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:46,520
I've also wanted...

453
00:15:46,520 --> 00:15:48,150
to fall in love.

454
00:15:48,150 --> 00:15:52,120
Your dad once told me that
he'd never make me suffer.

455
00:15:52,390 --> 00:15:54,170
But look at me now.

456
00:15:54,170 --> 00:15:56,300
I'm suffering so much.

457
00:15:56,300 --> 00:15:57,890
Do you think love lasts forever?

458
00:15:57,890 --> 00:15:59,600
That's not true.

459
00:15:59,630 --> 00:16:01,970
Love doesn't last a long time.

460
00:16:02,260 --> 00:16:04,080
You think your love
may last forever,

461
00:16:04,080 --> 00:16:05,100
but that's not true.

462
00:16:05,100 --> 00:16:06,100
Bong Won looked lonely too.

463
00:16:06,100 --> 00:16:08,080
I met him at a sauna recently,
and he was eating alone.

464
00:16:08,080 --> 00:16:12,140
How dare you call your dad
by his first name?

465
00:16:12,140 --> 00:16:14,720
- Where are your manners?
- How could you call him that?

466
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:17,250
He was eating all alone.

467
00:16:17,250 --> 00:16:20,230
Listen to me.
Love doesn't last forever.

468
00:16:20,330 --> 00:16:21,930
I'm begging you.

469
00:16:21,930 --> 00:16:23,200
Say something.

470
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:24,960
- Mom.
- Hold on. It seems like...

471
00:16:24,960 --> 00:16:26,300
- All right.
- we need to say something.

472
00:16:26,300 --> 00:16:28,020
- It does.
- Right?

473
00:16:28,020 --> 00:16:30,470
- Right?
- Do you think love lasts forever?

474
00:16:30,670 --> 00:16:33,810
That's not true.
Love doesn't last forever.

475
00:16:33,810 --> 00:16:34,860
Love is...

476
00:16:34,860 --> 00:16:36,630
Love changes after three years!

477
00:16:36,630 --> 00:16:38,530
- Love changes!
- Love can always change!

478
00:16:38,530 --> 00:16:40,370
- And...
- I keep telling you...

479
00:16:40,370 --> 00:16:41,850
that love changes after three years!

480
00:16:41,850 --> 00:16:43,510
- That's spicy.
- Yes, a bit.

481
00:16:44,220 --> 00:16:46,240
Mom likes to make spicy dishes.

482
00:16:46,640 --> 00:16:48,010
- Isn't it tasty?
- Yes.

483
00:16:48,010 --> 00:16:49,320
What do you do to show
that it's good?

484
00:16:49,380 --> 00:16:50,650
- What?
- What do you do?

485
00:16:50,650 --> 00:16:52,150
(He looks gloomy.)

486
00:16:52,150 --> 00:16:54,350
What do you do to show
that it's good?

487
00:16:54,350 --> 00:16:55,980
Why is this so spicy?

488
00:16:56,100 --> 00:16:58,490
It's Portuguese.

489
00:16:58,730 --> 00:17:00,860
- Portuguese?
- They do it in Brazil.

490
00:17:00,990 --> 00:17:02,470
What do you do to show
that it's good?

491
00:17:02,470 --> 00:17:03,600
(What do Brazilians say
if something's tasty?)

492
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:05,440
- Thumbs up.
- Okay!

493
00:17:05,440 --> 00:17:07,340
(Il Hwa's Secret Mission:
Double thumbs up)

494
00:17:07,340 --> 00:17:08,630
But...

495
00:17:08,730 --> 00:17:10,140
you do it with two hands.

496
00:17:10,140 --> 00:17:11,140
(How do you do it with both hands?)

497
00:17:11,140 --> 00:17:12,440
- Thumbs up?
- Yes.

498
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:14,240
Double thumbs up!

499
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:15,740
(He gives two thumbs up.)

500
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:17,980
(You're the best.)

501
00:17:17,980 --> 00:17:19,540
- Jae Suk, you've succeeded.
- What now?

502
00:17:19,540 --> 00:17:21,240
- You and Il Hwa are a family.
- Yes!

503
00:17:22,780 --> 00:17:24,460
- Who is it?
- Thumbs up.

504
00:17:24,460 --> 00:17:27,930
- Daniel!
- Hello.

505
00:17:28,250 --> 00:17:29,860
- Hey.
- He's our youngest.

506
00:17:29,860 --> 00:17:32,050
- Come on in. Welcome.
- Hello.

507
00:17:32,050 --> 00:17:35,060
Who went to Room 101
in your stead?

508
00:17:35,060 --> 00:17:37,560
- Se Chan.
- No way.

509
00:17:37,900 --> 00:17:40,300
(Se Chan went
to the Good-looking Room?)

510
00:17:40,410 --> 00:17:42,110
- Not you?
- No, Se Chan went there.

511
00:17:42,110 --> 00:17:44,270
- No way. You didn't go there?
- No, Se Chan did.

512
00:17:44,270 --> 00:17:45,680
He's handsome.

513
00:17:46,270 --> 00:17:47,710
- Where's Room 101?
- You guys...

514
00:17:47,710 --> 00:17:49,000
Where is it? Is it here?

515
00:17:49,810 --> 00:17:52,570
I'm representing Dongducheon.

516
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:54,810
- Se Chan the Handsome is here.
- Don't be ridiculous.

517
00:17:54,810 --> 00:17:57,960
- Leave. Don't be ridiculous.
- Hey!

518
00:17:57,960 --> 00:17:59,630
- Get out.
- Mom.

519
00:17:59,630 --> 00:18:01,360
- Hello, Mom.
- Get out.

520
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:03,160
- Why?
- This makes no sense.

521
00:18:03,160 --> 00:18:04,820
- Mom.
- Mom. Hi.

522
00:18:04,820 --> 00:18:06,430
- You and Jae Suk are...
- He's fine.

523
00:18:06,430 --> 00:18:08,930
- Mom.
- I'm Se Chan the Handsome.

524
00:18:08,930 --> 00:18:11,090
He's not your son. Look at his face.

525
00:18:11,090 --> 00:18:12,200
Hello, Mom.

526
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:13,970
I'm good-looking.

527
00:18:13,970 --> 00:18:16,000
I'd like to see how flexible
you guys are.

528
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,140
So Min, can you show me...

529
00:18:18,140 --> 00:18:20,040
a leg split?

530
00:18:20,040 --> 00:18:21,570
Are you flexible?

531
00:18:21,570 --> 00:18:22,980
No.

532
00:18:22,980 --> 00:18:24,920
- Split our legs?
- But I'll do anything...

533
00:18:24,920 --> 00:18:26,190
to become your son.

534
00:18:26,450 --> 00:18:27,720
I can rip my mouth as well.

535
00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:29,240
- How should I do it?
- I should measure it.

536
00:18:29,240 --> 00:18:30,280
Like this?

537
00:18:30,860 --> 00:18:32,250
- You're very flexible.
- Gosh.

538
00:18:32,250 --> 00:18:33,630
(Stretching)

539
00:18:33,730 --> 00:18:34,780
She might touch the ground.

540
00:18:34,780 --> 00:18:36,750
200cm.

541
00:18:36,750 --> 00:18:38,130
I want to have a good-looking mom.

542
00:18:39,050 --> 00:18:41,020
I need to be in this family as well.

543
00:18:41,020 --> 00:18:42,490
You don't belong here.

544
00:18:42,490 --> 00:18:43,760
You're not her son.

545
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:45,060
(She wants to destroy
the family tree.)

546
00:18:45,260 --> 00:18:46,470
You're not her son.

547
00:18:46,470 --> 00:18:47,730
- Se Chan.
- Just...

548
00:18:47,730 --> 00:18:50,140
If you can't split that well,
it means you're rejecting me.

549
00:18:50,140 --> 00:18:52,300
Not at all. Mom, I can do this.

550
00:18:52,300 --> 00:18:55,380
(Mom, I can do this.)

551
00:18:56,240 --> 00:18:57,380
Hey.

552
00:18:57,380 --> 00:18:58,810
(He fails.)

553
00:18:58,810 --> 00:19:00,190
- All right. Measure it.
- You're...

554
00:19:00,190 --> 00:19:02,040
blatantly rejecting me.

555
00:19:02,040 --> 00:19:04,120
- How much is it?
- 180cm.

556
00:19:04,120 --> 00:19:05,420
(He fails.)

557
00:19:05,420 --> 00:19:06,750
I'm not even 180cm tall.

558
00:19:06,750 --> 00:19:08,020
You were never...

559
00:19:08,020 --> 00:19:09,460
Get lost.

560
00:19:09,750 --> 00:19:10,820
What did you say?

561
00:19:11,320 --> 00:19:13,490
(She rejects him.)

562
00:19:13,490 --> 00:19:14,790
Fine, then!

563
00:19:14,790 --> 00:19:16,470
Get lost if you don't want
to get hit.

564
00:19:16,730 --> 00:19:18,370
I'm going to find a new mom.

565
00:19:18,990 --> 00:19:20,760
- Okay, just watch me.
- Watch what?

566
00:19:20,940 --> 00:19:22,210
My goodness.

567
00:19:22,210 --> 00:19:23,680
- What?
- Welcome.

568
00:19:23,680 --> 00:19:24,830
Goodness. Wait.

569
00:19:24,940 --> 00:19:26,150
- Jae Suk.
- Yes?

570
00:19:26,150 --> 00:19:27,980
They're strict about looks.

571
00:19:27,980 --> 00:19:29,270
So get lost.

572
00:19:29,540 --> 00:19:31,810
- I've already found a family.
- You should leave.

573
00:19:31,810 --> 00:19:33,390
- Really?
- Daniel, come in.

574
00:19:33,390 --> 00:19:35,480
- Come in.
- He's the best-looking one.

575
00:19:36,250 --> 00:19:37,620
She told me to get lost.

576
00:19:37,620 --> 00:19:39,010
- She said that to me.
- Did you say that?

577
00:19:39,010 --> 00:19:40,430
- Hey.
- He failed, right?

578
00:19:40,430 --> 00:19:42,250
- Well...
- She told me to get lost.

579
00:19:42,250 --> 00:19:44,400
I told him to get lost for now.

580
00:19:46,050 --> 00:19:47,170
She told me to get lost.

581
00:19:47,170 --> 00:19:48,170
(The terrible son leaves.)

582
00:19:48,170 --> 00:19:49,970
- Fine.
- Come here.

583
00:19:49,970 --> 00:19:50,990
- Goodness.
- Where were you?

584
00:19:50,990 --> 00:19:53,330
You came well. You are good-looking.

585
00:19:53,330 --> 00:19:54,640
- Where were you?
- You failed.

586
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:56,530
You're my younger brother.
You belong here.

587
00:19:56,530 --> 00:19:57,530
Thank you.

588
00:19:57,530 --> 00:19:59,180
Sit down.

589
00:19:59,180 --> 00:20:00,340
(Her voice becomes softer.)

590
00:20:00,340 --> 00:20:03,040
I do recognize your face.

591
00:20:03,040 --> 00:20:05,010
- You're a famous idol.
- He's Daniel.

592
00:20:05,040 --> 00:20:06,310
- His name is Kang Daniel.
- I'm Kang Daniel.

593
00:20:06,340 --> 00:20:07,980
- You're Kan Daniel?
- Yes.

594
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:09,550
- It's Kang, not Kan.
- Yes.

595
00:20:09,550 --> 00:20:10,890
- You're him?
- Yes.

596
00:20:10,890 --> 00:20:12,550
I'm sorry. I do know you.

597
00:20:12,550 --> 00:20:15,160
But I didn't think
it'd really be you.

598
00:20:15,160 --> 00:20:16,630
- You thought he was a lookalike?
- Yes.

599
00:20:16,630 --> 00:20:17,900
(She's happy to have found
a proper heir to the family line.)

600
00:20:17,900 --> 00:20:19,320
I didn't know it was really you.

601
00:20:19,320 --> 00:20:20,400
It's me, Mom.

602
00:20:21,900 --> 00:20:23,730
Daniel. All right.

603
00:20:23,990 --> 00:20:25,490
- Uncle.
- Who is it?

604
00:20:25,490 --> 00:20:26,710
- Uncle.
- Father.

605
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:29,410
(They address him differently.)

606
00:20:29,830 --> 00:20:31,110
- Goodness.
- What is this?

607
00:20:31,110 --> 00:20:32,440
- Are you busy?
- Hello.

608
00:20:32,440 --> 00:20:33,480
Hello.

609
00:20:33,480 --> 00:20:34,500
(She looks reluctant to see him.)

610
00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:36,480
- You were here?
- Have you found a family?

611
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:37,840
I was...

612
00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:39,810
- You don't have the looks.
- somewhere else.

613
00:20:39,810 --> 00:20:41,650
I didn't like the other mom.

614
00:20:41,810 --> 00:20:44,190
(She's disappointed that
he hasn't found a family.)

615
00:20:44,190 --> 00:20:47,280
I went to the Intelligent Room.
I had to keep solving problems.

616
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:48,730
(Unaware of how she feels,
he keeps complaining.)

617
00:20:48,730 --> 00:20:51,400
- Sit down.
- Okay.

618
00:20:51,460 --> 00:20:54,060
Mom has a plan.

619
00:20:54,060 --> 00:20:55,760
Aren't we around the same age?

620
00:20:55,970 --> 00:20:56,970
Come on.

621
00:20:56,970 --> 00:20:58,560
- Get into character.
- Yes, Mom.

622
00:20:58,700 --> 00:21:04,410
Look into the mirror
and tell me how you look.

623
00:21:04,830 --> 00:21:07,480
Try role-playing by yourself.

624
00:21:07,480 --> 00:21:08,740
Role-playing?

625
00:21:09,180 --> 00:21:10,540
She didn't make us do that.

626
00:21:11,720 --> 00:21:14,810
Suk Jin, you've been blessed
with charms since you were born.

627
00:21:14,810 --> 00:21:16,920
You're way too humble.

628
00:21:17,010 --> 00:21:20,250
Why are you so timid
when you're this good-looking?

629
00:21:20,780 --> 00:21:22,930
Have confidence.

630
00:21:23,930 --> 00:21:25,290
I think it's best that you leave.

631
00:21:26,130 --> 00:21:27,760
(She agrees silently.)

632
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:30,440
Ever since the beginning,

633
00:21:30,530 --> 00:21:32,530
she wasn't happy with me.

634
00:21:32,530 --> 00:21:33,940
- That's not true.
- No, I think you weren't.

635
00:21:33,940 --> 00:21:35,640
- You see...
- Is this family set?

636
00:21:35,640 --> 00:21:37,140
- No.
- Just say that it is,

637
00:21:37,140 --> 00:21:38,210
and I'll leave.

638
00:21:38,440 --> 00:21:39,480
- Should I?
- Yes.

639
00:21:39,480 --> 00:21:40,570
(He tries to save face.)

640
00:21:40,650 --> 00:21:41,840
- Should I?
- Yes.

641
00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:44,380
(That would be great.)

642
00:21:44,380 --> 00:21:45,570
Goodness!

643
00:21:45,570 --> 00:21:48,120
None of us had to role-play.

644
00:21:48,120 --> 00:21:50,460
I shouldn't have come.
I should've known better.

645
00:21:50,460 --> 00:21:51,810
Suk Jin.

646
00:21:51,810 --> 00:21:54,230
If you're feeling too lonely,
you can come back.

647
00:21:54,230 --> 00:21:55,430
- Okay, Mom.
- I will...

648
00:21:55,430 --> 00:21:57,360
- always be waiting.
- Mom!

649
00:21:57,360 --> 00:21:58,430
- I'll see you later.
- But first,

650
00:21:58,430 --> 00:21:59,670
- So you're all set.
- you should be independent.

651
00:21:59,670 --> 00:22:00,700
That's not the way out.

652
00:22:00,730 --> 00:22:02,020
That's the bathroom.

653
00:22:02,020 --> 00:22:03,060
What?

654
00:22:03,290 --> 00:22:04,900
- Where do I go?
- Over there.

655
00:22:04,990 --> 00:22:06,910
- Mom, bye.
- Suk Jin.

656
00:22:06,910 --> 00:22:08,300
- He's definitely not one of us.
- I just want you...

657
00:22:08,300 --> 00:22:10,270
- to become independent.
- Bye, Mom!

658
00:22:10,270 --> 00:22:12,330
You can come back
if you're struggling or lonely.

659
00:22:12,330 --> 00:22:13,450
Okay!

660
00:22:13,450 --> 00:22:15,800
This isn't good.
I'm running out of places to go.

661
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:17,380
I am.

662
00:22:18,270 --> 00:22:20,280
<i>- Mom</i>
- Se Chan!

663
00:22:20,280 --> 00:22:21,740
<i>Dad</i>

664
00:22:22,190 --> 00:22:25,160
<i>We have finally met</i>

665
00:22:25,390 --> 00:22:26,960
Goodness.

666
00:22:27,020 --> 00:22:28,750
We've finally met.

667
00:22:28,750 --> 00:22:30,520
- Se Chan.
- Hello.

668
00:22:30,520 --> 00:22:32,200
- Have you been well?
- Yes.

669
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:34,990
- Aren't you hungry?
- I'm famished.

670
00:22:36,370 --> 00:22:38,200
- Have some.
- Okay.

671
00:22:38,200 --> 00:22:39,260
Open wide.

672
00:22:41,530 --> 00:22:42,730
How does it taste?

673
00:22:42,730 --> 00:22:44,000
Does it taste like the one
from before?

674
00:22:46,330 --> 00:22:48,180
(The spiciness spreads
throughout his body.)

675
00:22:48,180 --> 00:22:50,150
(The taste brings tears
to his eyes.)

676
00:22:50,150 --> 00:22:51,840
This brings tears to my eyes.

677
00:22:52,180 --> 00:22:53,740
It's really good.

678
00:22:54,420 --> 00:22:55,510
Really?

679
00:22:56,390 --> 00:22:57,390
How does it taste?

680
00:22:57,420 --> 00:22:58,460
What?

681
00:22:58,690 --> 00:23:00,130
- It's full of love.
- You were here.

682
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:01,550
She's my mom.

683
00:23:01,550 --> 00:23:02,980
- Right?
- It's really spicy.

684
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:06,020
- Her cooking skills have changed.
- I was dying too.

685
00:23:06,230 --> 00:23:08,320
- Since it's spicy...
- It is.

686
00:23:09,290 --> 00:23:10,530
This is honey.

687
00:23:10,530 --> 00:23:12,530
- It's ice cream with honey.
- Have some.

688
00:23:12,990 --> 00:23:14,610
(It's a mixture of sweet ice cream
and nutty sesame oil.)

689
00:23:14,610 --> 00:23:15,830
This is honey.

690
00:23:16,800 --> 00:23:18,500
It's full of honey. I made it.

691
00:23:18,770 --> 00:23:21,800
(It's very greasy.)

692
00:23:23,570 --> 00:23:25,950
(What is this unfamiliar taste?)

693
00:23:25,950 --> 00:23:29,150
He knows how to react well.
He's fit for this family.

694
00:23:29,510 --> 00:23:31,160
(He reacts as best as he can.)

695
00:23:31,160 --> 00:23:32,190
Look at him.

696
00:23:32,310 --> 00:23:33,520
He's good.

697
00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:35,280
Goodness, Mom!

698
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:38,090
- This is...
- The greasiness is killing me!

699
00:23:38,520 --> 00:23:39,660
- Gosh!
- Try it.

700
00:23:39,660 --> 00:23:40,930
I'm thinking about opening...

701
00:23:40,930 --> 00:23:42,170
- an ice cream shop.
- Right.

702
00:23:42,170 --> 00:23:43,330
- Try it.
- Gosh.

703
00:23:43,830 --> 00:23:45,560
I really thought it was honey.

704
00:23:45,560 --> 00:23:49,060
Gosh, the inside of my mouth
is glistening.

705
00:23:49,060 --> 00:23:50,710
(His mouth is full of greasiness.)

706
00:23:50,710 --> 00:23:52,940
- How much does he need to eat?
- Six spoonfuls.

707
00:23:52,940 --> 00:23:53,980
Go on.

708
00:23:54,450 --> 00:23:56,070
(He finds a pile of gimbap
underneath the cloth.)

709
00:23:56,070 --> 00:23:57,570
Do I need to finish all this?

710
00:23:57,570 --> 00:23:58,620
No.

711
00:23:58,980 --> 00:24:00,840
(Startled)

712
00:24:00,840 --> 00:24:03,010
- I'm out!
- No!

713
00:24:03,010 --> 00:24:04,860
- I'm going! I can't eat all that!
- No!

714
00:24:04,860 --> 00:24:07,280
- No!
- I might die!

715
00:24:07,280 --> 00:24:08,960
- No!
- I'm on an empty stomach!

716
00:24:09,250 --> 00:24:10,630
Eat it.

717
00:24:10,630 --> 00:24:12,050
Eat up.

718
00:24:12,050 --> 00:24:13,520
(Thanks to her motherly love,
she feeds him more.)

719
00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:14,990
It's not easy to become a family.

720
00:24:15,090 --> 00:24:16,130
Eat up.

721
00:24:16,130 --> 00:24:17,170
- You little punk.
- This is your last.

722
00:24:17,170 --> 00:24:20,110
(Good boy. Eat up.)

723
00:24:21,670 --> 00:24:23,440
- Done.
- Hold on. Where's the water?

724
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:24,640
- You're done.
- Have some water.

725
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:25,830
- Here.
- You're done.

726
00:24:25,830 --> 00:24:27,150
- Drink up.
- Good.

727
00:24:27,150 --> 00:24:28,340
- Good job.
- Good.

728
00:24:28,340 --> 00:24:29,610
Good job. Here.

729
00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:31,220
Give me a minute.

730
00:24:31,220 --> 00:24:33,220
- Goodness. Have some more.
- I won't be a part of this family.

731
00:24:33,220 --> 00:24:34,450
- Have one more.
- Just this much.

732
00:24:34,450 --> 00:24:35,890
- Wait.
- Just this much.

733
00:24:35,890 --> 00:24:37,550
You only need to have
three spoonfuls.

734
00:24:37,550 --> 00:24:39,580
- Hurry up.
- Eat some.

735
00:24:39,580 --> 00:24:41,280
- What is that?
- I'm begging you.

736
00:24:41,280 --> 00:24:42,660
- Look at her.
- Mom.

737
00:24:42,660 --> 00:24:45,460
- Hold on.
- You disrespectful son!

738
00:24:45,730 --> 00:24:47,430
How dare you make your mother kneel.

739
00:24:47,430 --> 00:24:50,170
Everything in here
is good for your immune system.

740
00:24:50,170 --> 00:24:51,590
All I want is for you to be healthy.

741
00:24:51,590 --> 00:24:52,900
You want me as your son?

742
00:24:52,900 --> 00:24:54,000
- Of course, I do.
- Of course.

743
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:55,330
That's why I got down on my knees.

744
00:24:55,330 --> 00:24:56,910
- Hold on.
- We all...

745
00:24:56,910 --> 00:24:58,680
- have protruding teeth.
- Oh, dear.

746
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:00,710
There's no doubt
that you're my brother.

747
00:25:00,710 --> 00:25:03,220
We don't take after our mom.

748
00:25:03,220 --> 00:25:04,880
We look like our dad,

749
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:06,240
hence the protruding teeth.

750
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:07,780
- Right.
- Now eat.

751
00:25:07,780 --> 00:25:10,080
- There.
- Good boy.

752
00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:11,160
So...

753
00:25:11,160 --> 00:25:12,160
My gosh!

754
00:25:12,160 --> 00:25:14,980
- He cleared the bowl.
- Since you cleared the bowl,

755
00:25:14,980 --> 00:25:17,160
you are now part of Il Hwa's family.

756
00:25:18,460 --> 00:25:21,060
I finally met my family!

757
00:25:21,060 --> 00:25:22,730
Jong Kook, welcome to the family.

758
00:25:22,970 --> 00:25:24,200
What a relief.

759
00:25:25,060 --> 00:25:27,000
How can love change?

760
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:28,470
My youngest daughter,

761
00:25:28,470 --> 00:25:30,710
- I will give you a pop quiz.
- Sure.

762
00:25:30,710 --> 00:25:32,710
You must calculate
the numbers in your head.

763
00:25:32,710 --> 00:25:33,800
Sure.

764
00:25:34,110 --> 00:25:37,040
What is 13 multiplied by 4 plus 8?

765
00:25:38,570 --> 00:25:40,190
(Cavewoman Ji Hyo's brain
is fully activated.)

766
00:25:40,190 --> 00:25:41,740
If it's too hard for you,
just run out of here.

767
00:25:42,840 --> 00:25:44,620
I'll search for my next mother.

768
00:25:46,390 --> 00:25:48,080
Ji Hyo, is it too difficult?

769
00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:49,900
Should I ask you another one?

770
00:25:49,900 --> 00:25:51,960
What is 24 multiplied by 2...

771
00:25:52,090 --> 00:25:53,700
plus 30?

772
00:25:54,790 --> 00:25:56,590
- 23?
- 24 multiplied by...

773
00:25:56,590 --> 00:25:57,790
- 2...
- 24 multiplied by 2.

774
00:25:57,790 --> 00:25:59,330
Plus 30.

775
00:25:59,330 --> 00:26:01,060
(Mi Sun is unfazed
by Ji Hyo's ridiculous response.)

776
00:26:01,330 --> 00:26:03,000
What is 24 multiplied by 2 plus 30?

777
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:04,640
- It's difficult.
- Right?

778
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:05,770
It's 78.

779
00:26:06,110 --> 00:26:07,450
- That's correct.
- Is it?

780
00:26:07,450 --> 00:26:09,180
My gosh. No way!

781
00:26:09,680 --> 00:26:11,070
- I did it.
- Unbelievable.

782
00:26:11,070 --> 00:26:12,270
Can you believe it?

783
00:26:12,270 --> 00:26:13,480
- Nice.
- How did you do it?

784
00:26:13,480 --> 00:26:15,040
- No way.
- Awesome.

785
00:26:15,450 --> 00:26:16,480
All right then.

786
00:26:16,980 --> 00:26:20,080
- So Daniel...
- Yes?

787
00:26:20,080 --> 00:26:22,050
- Look in the mirror.
- And?

788
00:26:22,050 --> 00:26:23,990
And talk to yourself.

789
00:26:23,990 --> 00:26:25,230
Think of this as an acting class.

790
00:26:25,230 --> 00:26:28,930
What is it like to look
in the mirror every day?

791
00:26:29,260 --> 00:26:30,590
Compared to Suk Jin,

792
00:26:30,590 --> 00:26:32,140
you're giving him a lot of chances.

793
00:26:32,200 --> 00:26:33,870
I'm a human being after all.

794
00:26:33,870 --> 00:26:35,560
Yes, of course.

795
00:26:35,610 --> 00:26:37,480
- Go ahead.
- What's with your hair?

796
00:26:37,480 --> 00:26:39,270
The color's off and
the eyebrows are weird.

797
00:26:39,270 --> 00:26:40,710
When did you dye your hair?

798
00:26:41,500 --> 00:26:42,650
- Two days ago.
- I see...

799
00:26:42,650 --> 00:26:43,840
you don't like keeping it one color.

800
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:45,570
- Right.
- If that's the case,

801
00:26:45,570 --> 00:26:47,390
how do you feel about it?

802
00:26:47,580 --> 00:26:49,390
I mean...

803
00:26:49,980 --> 00:26:51,510
You're being direct.

804
00:26:51,890 --> 00:26:52,980
Must you be this direct?

805
00:26:52,980 --> 00:26:55,480
- Se Chan and Suk Jin...
- I'm just saying what I want to.

806
00:26:55,480 --> 00:26:56,960
- My hair...
- I understand, but...

807
00:26:56,960 --> 00:26:58,200
- Still...
- I'm fed up with it.

808
00:26:58,200 --> 00:26:59,320
- What?
- I'm fed up with it.

809
00:26:59,320 --> 00:27:01,060
And so...

810
00:27:01,060 --> 00:27:02,870
put that in four syllables.

811
00:27:02,870 --> 00:27:04,200
Are you kidding me?

812
00:27:04,200 --> 00:27:05,990
- She's feeding him the answer.
- In four syllables.

813
00:27:05,990 --> 00:27:07,830
- It has turned into a quiz show.
- My face...

814
00:27:08,110 --> 00:27:10,110
- Your hair...
- I'm fed up with it.

815
00:27:10,110 --> 00:27:11,180
My gosh.

816
00:27:11,180 --> 00:27:12,610
(Young Hee is desperate,
but Daniel is clueless.)

817
00:27:12,610 --> 00:27:14,180
S and K...

818
00:27:14,180 --> 00:27:15,540
Are you kidding me?

819
00:27:15,540 --> 00:27:18,680
(Even moms are allowed to be fans.)

820
00:27:19,420 --> 00:27:20,420
Is this allowed?

821
00:27:20,420 --> 00:27:22,080
Gosh, how sickening.

822
00:27:22,080 --> 00:27:23,810
- What?
- Oh, no.

823
00:27:24,310 --> 00:27:25,890
- That's so close!
- Is that not it?

824
00:27:25,890 --> 00:27:27,960
- Unbelievable.
- I'll give you one last chance.

825
00:27:27,960 --> 00:27:29,250
- Sure.
- It's not some foreign flavor.

826
00:27:29,250 --> 00:27:31,430
Right. This is how it should taste.

827
00:27:31,430 --> 00:27:32,460
- Correct!
- This is how it should taste.

828
00:27:32,460 --> 00:27:33,730
(Il Hwa is the second mom
to complete her family.)

829
00:27:33,730 --> 00:27:34,730
We did it.

830
00:27:34,730 --> 00:27:36,090
- Did I get it right?
- Suk Jin succeeded.

831
00:27:36,090 --> 00:27:37,700
Then...

832
00:27:37,700 --> 00:27:39,490
Be harsher with your words.

833
00:27:39,730 --> 00:27:40,910
It should be harsher, right?

834
00:27:40,910 --> 00:27:42,370
I'm sick and tired of it.

835
00:27:42,370 --> 00:27:44,180
(Young Hee's hidden mission)

836
00:27:44,680 --> 00:27:46,410
(That's it!)

837
00:27:46,800 --> 00:27:48,240
Gosh, that wasn't easy.

838
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:50,510
- It wasn't easy to guess.
- I know.

839
00:27:50,510 --> 00:27:52,310
It wasn't easy.

840
00:27:52,310 --> 00:27:53,780
(The teams)

841
00:27:54,150 --> 00:27:57,190
Please welcome your moms
who are also your team leaders.

842
00:27:57,190 --> 00:27:59,690
Park Mi Sun, Lee Il Hwa,
and Hwang Young Hee.

843
00:28:00,660 --> 00:28:02,780
(Let's have a good time, Moms.)

844
00:28:02,980 --> 00:28:08,020
I know we're just
playing a game here, but...

845
00:28:08,090 --> 00:28:10,900
how can Suk Jin...

846
00:28:10,900 --> 00:28:13,330
call Il Hwa as his mom?

847
00:28:13,330 --> 00:28:15,260
I'm having
a hard time accepting this.

848
00:28:15,260 --> 00:28:17,230
It's making me angry.

849
00:28:17,230 --> 00:28:18,910
You see it in real life though.

850
00:28:18,910 --> 00:28:20,880
There are sons who look
older than their moms.

851
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:22,540
- Is that so?
- Yes.

852
00:28:22,540 --> 00:28:24,880
- Mom.
- It's making me angry.

853
00:28:25,270 --> 00:28:27,690
Also, he's her youngest son.

854
00:28:27,690 --> 00:28:29,690
- That's just how it is.
- He's younger than I am.

855
00:28:29,690 --> 00:28:31,160
That's ridiculous.

856
00:28:31,160 --> 00:28:32,980
He's first, I'm second,
and you're the youngest.

857
00:28:32,980 --> 00:28:34,890
Why? You're the youngest son.

858
00:28:34,890 --> 00:28:37,630
How is it that all three boys...

859
00:28:37,630 --> 00:28:39,790
only take after their father?

860
00:28:39,790 --> 00:28:41,590
(They look nothing
like their mother.)

861
00:28:41,590 --> 00:28:42,990
It happened that way.

862
00:28:42,990 --> 00:28:44,370
It's the same with you all.

863
00:28:44,370 --> 00:28:46,590
We should've taken after our mother.

864
00:28:46,590 --> 00:28:49,710
Anyway, let's have Il Hwa
say hello first.

865
00:28:49,710 --> 00:28:51,980
- Hello.
- Please say hello.

866
00:28:51,980 --> 00:28:55,210
Hello, everyone. I'm Lee Il Hwa.

867
00:28:55,210 --> 00:28:56,650
- You know...
- I'm...

868
00:28:56,650 --> 00:28:59,570
- a mother of three.
- Goodness.

869
00:28:59,570 --> 00:29:03,190
I hear that you've been wanting
to come out on our show.

870
00:29:03,190 --> 00:29:05,160
Well, I'm good at
physical activities.

871
00:29:05,160 --> 00:29:06,890
- Really?
- Yes.

872
00:29:06,890 --> 00:29:08,080
Haven't you practiced yoga
for a long time?

873
00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:11,730
- Right, she has.
- Actually, I haven't.

874
00:29:11,730 --> 00:29:13,990
- Just sit, Kwang Soo.
- I'm fine!

875
00:29:13,990 --> 00:29:15,700
(Kwang Soo's eager since
he's back from a break.)

876
00:29:15,700 --> 00:29:16,700
Just sit.

877
00:29:16,700 --> 00:29:17,700
I want to chime in!

878
00:29:17,700 --> 00:29:18,970
- Just sit.
- But...

879
00:29:18,970 --> 00:29:20,640
- Sit down.
- We were in the same show,

880
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:22,300
so we're close.

881
00:29:22,470 --> 00:29:24,480
- All right, fine.
- We get it, all right?

882
00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:26,300
- Be more attentive to your own mom.
- Just sit.

883
00:29:26,300 --> 00:29:27,500
- Mom...
- Should I disown you?

884
00:29:27,500 --> 00:29:30,270
- Gosh, of course not!
- Should I disown you?

885
00:29:30,270 --> 00:29:31,950
Did you hear that?

886
00:29:31,950 --> 00:29:32,950
"Should I disown you?"

887
00:29:32,950 --> 00:29:34,190
I'm sorry.

888
00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:37,720
Next up is Hwang Young Hee.

889
00:29:37,720 --> 00:29:38,780
(Young Hee will say hello next.)

890
00:29:39,080 --> 00:29:41,390
This is my first time meeting you,
you know.

891
00:29:41,390 --> 00:29:45,230
Is there something about you
that strangers don't know about?

892
00:29:45,230 --> 00:29:47,090
- Those who I haven't met before?
- Yes.

893
00:29:47,090 --> 00:29:48,900
They say I'm pretty.

894
00:29:50,730 --> 00:29:52,290
- That's right.
- Exactly!

895
00:29:53,330 --> 00:29:55,500
Those who meet her
for the first time say that?

896
00:29:55,610 --> 00:29:57,300
- Of course.
- That's right.

897
00:29:57,300 --> 00:29:58,910
- Of course, she's pretty.
- Right.

898
00:29:58,910 --> 00:30:00,500
I was surprised by her beauty too.

899
00:30:00,500 --> 00:30:01,910
I get what you're saying though.

900
00:30:01,910 --> 00:30:03,410
- In TV series...
- That's right.

901
00:30:03,410 --> 00:30:05,310
The characters I play
have really curly hair and such.

902
00:30:05,310 --> 00:30:07,690
I guess I look quite different
compared to that.

903
00:30:07,690 --> 00:30:10,660
- I look prettier than I do on TV.
- In person though,

904
00:30:10,660 --> 00:30:13,220
- you seem highly sophisticated.
- That's right.

905
00:30:13,220 --> 00:30:14,890
- Look at what she's wearing.
- Exactly.

906
00:30:14,890 --> 00:30:16,080
Even the way she talks.

907
00:30:16,080 --> 00:30:17,700
Is that so? Well, I agree.

908
00:30:18,700 --> 00:30:20,590
She's even using the terms
youngsters use.

909
00:30:20,970 --> 00:30:22,260
Did you hear it?

910
00:30:22,260 --> 00:30:24,900
- It's how youngsters talk.
- How sophisticated.

911
00:30:25,140 --> 00:30:28,170
So that was Young Hee, everyone.

912
00:30:28,730 --> 00:30:31,330
Lastly, let's welcome...

913
00:30:31,330 --> 00:30:33,230
the grand comedienne
who's also...

914
00:30:33,230 --> 00:30:35,880
a steady rock for all comedians.
Please welcome Park Mi Sun.

915
00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:38,040
Mother!

916
00:30:38,040 --> 00:30:39,980
There's something we should
congratulate her on.

917
00:30:39,980 --> 00:30:42,580
- What is it?
- She has an online channel...

918
00:30:42,580 --> 00:30:44,480
and the number of subscribers...

919
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:45,980
- has been growing.
- I saw you going to restaurants.

920
00:30:45,980 --> 00:30:48,020
- I saw that.
- Me too.

921
00:30:48,580 --> 00:30:50,050
- Me too.
- If that's the case,

922
00:30:50,050 --> 00:30:52,320
come over here
if you want to know more.

923
00:30:52,320 --> 00:30:54,590
- Anyway, I've been doing my best.
- Right.

924
00:30:54,590 --> 00:30:56,170
- So that was Park Mi Sun!
- It's not easy though.

925
00:30:56,170 --> 00:30:57,530
All right!

926
00:30:58,440 --> 00:31:00,410
Welcome, Mi Sun.

927
00:31:00,410 --> 00:31:02,060
Today's race is called...

928
00:31:02,060 --> 00:31:04,140
Another Rice Cake to the Ugly Child.

929
00:31:04,300 --> 00:31:06,530
The number of rice cakes
given to you will differ...

930
00:31:06,530 --> 00:31:08,110
depending on how you do each round.

931
00:31:08,110 --> 00:31:10,340
After each round, the moms...

932
00:31:10,340 --> 00:31:13,220
will hand out the rick cakes to
the children who disappointed her.

933
00:31:13,220 --> 00:31:16,450
The child with the most
amount of rice cakes...

934
00:31:16,450 --> 00:31:17,580
will receive the penalty...

935
00:31:17,580 --> 00:31:20,050
while the mom with
the lowest amount of rice cakes...

936
00:31:20,050 --> 00:31:22,860
will be rewarded as
Mother of the Year.

937
00:31:23,050 --> 00:31:24,460
We give out decent prizes, you know.

938
00:31:24,460 --> 00:31:26,900
You can hand out
all the rice cakes to one child...

939
00:31:26,900 --> 00:31:28,590
but also keep some...

940
00:31:28,590 --> 00:31:30,970
if none of the children
disappointed you.

941
00:31:30,970 --> 00:31:32,490
- The mom can keep some?
- Yes.

942
00:31:32,490 --> 00:31:35,170
You can reduce
the amount you have...

943
00:31:35,170 --> 00:31:36,870
by eating the rice cakes too.

944
00:31:37,270 --> 00:31:39,110
- Really?
- We can eat them?

945
00:31:39,110 --> 00:31:40,710
I love rice cakes!

946
00:31:40,710 --> 00:31:42,980
Then, a different amount
of rice cakes...

947
00:31:42,980 --> 00:31:44,770
will be given to you...

948
00:31:44,770 --> 00:31:46,770
according to the order
in which you formed your teams.

949
00:31:46,770 --> 00:31:49,220
Team Mi Sun that was formed first
gets one rice cake.

950
00:31:49,220 --> 00:31:52,250
- Nice.
- We were formed our team first.

951
00:31:52,250 --> 00:31:53,390
Look at that.

952
00:31:53,390 --> 00:31:54,960
This is nice.

953
00:31:54,960 --> 00:31:57,230
It looks delicious.
We could easily eat that.

954
00:31:57,230 --> 00:31:59,160
Next, Team Il Hwa gets two.

955
00:31:59,160 --> 00:32:00,630
- Nice.
- What a relief.

956
00:32:00,630 --> 00:32:01,970
I'm glad we're not given three.

957
00:32:02,200 --> 00:32:04,700
Team Young Hee will receive three.

958
00:32:04,970 --> 00:32:06,090
Her mission was the hardest.

959
00:32:06,090 --> 00:32:08,230
The mothers will now
hand out the rice cakes...

960
00:32:08,230 --> 00:32:10,000
to her children
who disappointed you.

961
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:11,440
- I see.
- All right.

962
00:32:11,440 --> 00:32:13,230
Right now?

963
00:32:13,230 --> 00:32:16,770
All three of them
are the apple of my eye.

964
00:32:16,770 --> 00:32:20,720
So maybe the one
I can rely on the most...

965
00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:21,780
(The most reliable
out of the three?)

966
00:32:21,780 --> 00:32:24,010
should be given the rice cake.

967
00:32:24,280 --> 00:32:27,860
The child I trust the most is Haha.

968
00:32:27,860 --> 00:32:29,520
(Haha!)

969
00:32:29,780 --> 00:32:30,900
(What a twist.)

970
00:32:30,900 --> 00:32:32,590
It wasn't me? Why?

971
00:32:32,590 --> 00:32:34,870
I thought it'd be me
since I'm on "My Little Old Boy."

972
00:32:34,970 --> 00:32:36,700
I'm afraid...

973
00:32:36,700 --> 00:32:38,490
Go, Haha!

974
00:32:38,490 --> 00:32:40,670
- Go, Haha!
- Nice one.

975
00:32:40,730 --> 00:32:42,000
How cool.

976
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:43,640
- That was cool?
- Next up is Il Hwa.

977
00:32:43,640 --> 00:32:45,000
Mom, go ahead.

978
00:32:46,270 --> 00:32:49,340
(Without a word,
she slides one over to him.)

979
00:32:49,340 --> 00:32:50,540
She didn't even say anything.

980
00:32:50,540 --> 00:32:52,880
She gave it to us
without even explaining why.

981
00:32:53,270 --> 00:32:55,450
- Mother!
- He's my eldest son, you see.

982
00:32:55,450 --> 00:32:56,450
So he gets a free pass?

983
00:32:56,450 --> 00:32:58,080
- Eldest sons are important.
- He's my eldest.

984
00:32:58,080 --> 00:32:59,420
I can feel it, you know.

985
00:32:59,420 --> 00:33:01,960
I can tell that
she adores me the most.

986
00:33:02,860 --> 00:33:03,990
- You can feel it?
- I bet it's why...

987
00:33:03,990 --> 00:33:04,990
you wanted us on your team.

988
00:33:04,990 --> 00:33:06,630
Even we can see that.

989
00:33:06,630 --> 00:33:08,060
- We can tell too.
- Il Hwa...

990
00:33:08,060 --> 00:33:09,060
adores me the most.

991
00:33:09,060 --> 00:33:10,700
You'll change your mind
at the end of the day.

992
00:33:10,700 --> 00:33:12,170
- All right.
- I'll be nice to you.

993
00:33:12,170 --> 00:33:14,800
- I'll be nice to you too.
- Next up is Young Hee.

994
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:16,110
- There are a lot.
- Back in the day,

995
00:33:16,110 --> 00:33:18,000
mothers would sacrifice themselves.

996
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:20,610
Just so that you don't argue,

997
00:33:20,610 --> 00:33:21,910
- I'll give you one each.
- Shouldn't you...

998
00:33:21,910 --> 00:33:23,110
consider who took the most time?

999
00:33:23,110 --> 00:33:25,680
- Shut it!
- Shouldn't you consider...

1000
00:33:25,680 --> 00:33:27,890
(Shut it!)

1001
00:33:28,450 --> 00:33:29,950
(Mom?)

1002
00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:32,080
You're the best!

1003
00:33:32,080 --> 00:33:33,890
- Young Hee...
- She's the best.

1004
00:33:33,890 --> 00:33:35,480
- Young Hee...
- She was going to hit me.

1005
00:33:35,690 --> 00:33:37,960
- Kwang Soo needs her.
- I love it.

1006
00:33:38,490 --> 00:33:39,860
Mom!

1007
00:33:40,630 --> 00:33:41,970
Mom.

1008
00:33:41,970 --> 00:33:43,430
(Your daughter is here!)

1009
00:33:43,630 --> 00:33:46,470
My daughter is born
to be a celebrity.

1010
00:33:46,470 --> 00:33:47,730
Right?

1011
00:33:47,730 --> 00:33:48,970
(So Min shows off her talents.)

1012
00:33:48,970 --> 00:33:50,380
Mom.

1013
00:33:50,380 --> 00:33:52,210
(Bouncing)

1014
00:33:53,070 --> 00:33:55,450
Mom!

1015
00:33:56,840 --> 00:33:58,880
Both my daughter and my son...

1016
00:33:58,880 --> 00:34:00,890
are talented and sociable.

1017
00:34:00,890 --> 00:34:03,040
You have a bright future
ahead of you.

1018
00:34:03,780 --> 00:34:05,480
Why would you put that in there?

1019
00:34:05,480 --> 00:34:06,920
It's a trend.

1020
00:34:07,080 --> 00:34:09,050
The shooting has begun,
so stop fidgeting around.

1021
00:34:09,050 --> 00:34:10,320
We have our mothers here today!

1022
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:12,050
- I'll put it aside.
- No, let me help.

1023
00:34:12,050 --> 00:34:13,230
I'll do it for you.

1024
00:34:13,230 --> 00:34:14,900
- Just sit there.
- They'll criticize me.

1025
00:34:14,900 --> 00:34:16,530
It's fine.
Wait, who's criticizing Haha?

1026
00:34:16,900 --> 00:34:18,460
The one with the protruding teeth.

1027
00:34:19,090 --> 00:34:20,340
The one with the protruding teeth?

1028
00:34:20,360 --> 00:34:22,240
I thought he was talking about me.
Wasn't it me?

1029
00:34:22,240 --> 00:34:23,670
Our mom has two sons
with protruding teeth...

1030
00:34:23,670 --> 00:34:25,070
and one son
who looks older than her.

1031
00:34:25,070 --> 00:34:26,900
(Se Chan, Jae Suk, Suk Jin)

1032
00:34:26,900 --> 00:34:28,610
The son who looks older than her?

1033
00:34:28,610 --> 00:34:30,210
- Did you take after her then?
- Yes.

1034
00:34:30,340 --> 00:34:32,780
I take after our mom.

1035
00:34:33,510 --> 00:34:36,150
Wait, there's honey.

1036
00:34:36,710 --> 00:34:37,780
It'll at least be tasty.

1037
00:34:37,780 --> 00:34:40,210
You can eat the rice cake
with what we have prepared.

1038
00:34:40,210 --> 00:34:41,780
It'll be delicious.

1039
00:34:41,780 --> 00:34:43,460
Can we have it with honey?

1040
00:34:44,300 --> 00:34:45,530
Thank you.

1041
00:34:45,530 --> 00:34:46,760
(Daniel gets honey.)

1042
00:34:49,130 --> 00:34:51,240
(The rice cake tastes
even better with honey.)

1043
00:34:51,760 --> 00:34:54,510
(Daniel wants to eat up
all his rice cakes.)

1044
00:34:55,240 --> 00:34:56,440
Wait.

1045
00:34:56,510 --> 00:34:58,030
You in the middle,
are you a family member too?

1046
00:34:58,110 --> 00:35:00,380
Me? Yes, I am a family member.

1047
00:35:00,670 --> 00:35:02,050
- I don't think so.
- I am.

1048
00:35:02,150 --> 00:35:03,380
I take after Mom the most.

1049
00:35:03,380 --> 00:35:04,840
I gave all the good features
to one child.

1050
00:35:05,480 --> 00:35:07,490
I gave all the good features
to one child.

1051
00:35:07,740 --> 00:35:08,940
I love the words she uses.

1052
00:35:09,190 --> 00:35:10,590
She has such a good sense of humor.

1053
00:35:11,190 --> 00:35:13,760
Daniel has his mom's eyes.

1054
00:35:13,760 --> 00:35:15,650
I had plastic surgery.

1055
00:35:15,650 --> 00:35:17,550
(I had plastic surgery.)

1056
00:35:17,550 --> 00:35:19,300
(She didn't have to confess
to having plastic surgery.)

1057
00:35:19,300 --> 00:35:20,920
You didn't have to say that.

1058
00:35:20,920 --> 00:35:22,320
She's so straightforward.

1059
00:35:22,570 --> 00:35:25,070
- It's Cheongdam-dong style.
- Gosh.

1060
00:35:25,300 --> 00:35:26,690
She's so straightforward.

1061
00:35:26,690 --> 00:35:27,760
(Mom is not afraid
to tell the truth.)

1062
00:35:27,760 --> 00:35:28,800
By the way,

1063
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:30,510
is that your real name?

1064
00:35:31,010 --> 00:35:33,110
Lee Il Hwa.
That's such a sophisticated name.

1065
00:35:33,110 --> 00:35:34,670
- Does that mean...
- Il Hwa.

1066
00:35:35,010 --> 00:35:36,210
"one flower"?

1067
00:35:36,440 --> 00:35:39,380
I use the character for "one"
that banks use.

1068
00:35:39,380 --> 00:35:41,050
Mi Sun,

1069
00:35:41,050 --> 00:35:42,650
- what does "Mi" mean?
- Does it mean "beautiful"?

1070
00:35:42,650 --> 00:35:43,710
"Crazy"?

1071
00:35:45,010 --> 00:35:46,050
"Crazy"?

1072
00:35:46,050 --> 00:35:47,360
(What is that?)

1073
00:35:47,420 --> 00:35:49,360
(Suk Jin tries to remember all
the Chinese characters he knows.)

1074
00:35:49,490 --> 00:35:51,050
My name means
"beautiful and kind."

1075
00:35:52,260 --> 00:35:56,570
- Does your name mean "crazy water"?
- No, it doesn't.

1076
00:35:57,090 --> 00:35:58,840
- That's not what it means.
- You're crazy about water?

1077
00:35:58,840 --> 00:36:00,360
No, I'm not crazy about water.

1078
00:36:00,610 --> 00:36:02,170
Dogs are crazy about water.

1079
00:36:02,240 --> 00:36:03,360
- Dogs are like that.
- Hey!

1080
00:36:03,360 --> 00:36:05,280
- You're a dog.
- My mom named me!

1081
00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:07,340
Dogs are crazy about water and snow.

1082
00:36:07,340 --> 00:36:08,570
We're just curious.

1083
00:36:08,570 --> 00:36:10,440
No, it doesn't mean "crazy water."

1084
00:36:10,440 --> 00:36:12,280
Daniel is going crazy.

1085
00:36:12,280 --> 00:36:13,920
He was a dog.

1086
00:36:14,190 --> 00:36:15,820
"Kwang" means "light,"
and "Soo" means the "waterside".

1087
00:36:15,820 --> 00:36:17,090
- "Crazy water".
- "The light by the waterside..."

1088
00:36:17,090 --> 00:36:18,550
Suk Jin's name means
a "real stone."

1089
00:36:18,550 --> 00:36:19,920
- No, it doesn't.
- A "real stone"?

1090
00:36:19,920 --> 00:36:21,090
It means a "real stone."

1091
00:36:21,360 --> 00:36:23,380
- It means "tin" and "stars."
- It means a "big stone."

1092
00:36:23,420 --> 00:36:25,260
- His name means a "big stone."
- A "big stone"?

1093
00:36:25,260 --> 00:36:26,800
A "big stone".

1094
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:29,230
- What about your name?
- It means the "world" and "shiny."

1095
00:36:29,230 --> 00:36:31,300
- "Make the world shine."
- I thought it meant "side dishes."

1096
00:36:31,300 --> 00:36:32,440
"Side dishes"?

1097
00:36:32,440 --> 00:36:34,300
What kind of side dishes?

1098
00:36:34,300 --> 00:36:36,240
- The "world" and...
- Seasoned cucumbers?

1099
00:36:36,240 --> 00:36:37,610
- The "world" and...
- Cucumbers?

1100
00:36:37,610 --> 00:36:38,800
"The world's side dishes."

1101
00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:40,300
- "The world's side dishes."
- The "world" and...

1102
00:36:40,300 --> 00:36:41,340
Dried squid.

1103
00:36:41,940 --> 00:36:43,150
Dried squid?

1104
00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:45,210
- Se Chan must be annoyed.
- They're so annoying.

1105
00:36:45,320 --> 00:36:46,480
So Min, what about your name?

1106
00:36:46,610 --> 00:36:48,650
"So" means "bright,"
and "Min" means the "sky."

1107
00:36:48,710 --> 00:36:49,820
Her name suits her.

1108
00:36:49,820 --> 00:36:50,920
- "Min" means the "sky"?
- Yes.

1109
00:36:50,920 --> 00:36:52,590
- The "bright sky"?
- "Bright as the sky."

1110
00:36:52,820 --> 00:36:54,130
(Daniel suddenly giggles.)

1111
00:36:54,130 --> 00:36:56,360
- She is bright.
- She is.

1112
00:36:56,650 --> 00:36:59,400
I still keep thinking
about "side dishes."

1113
00:36:59,400 --> 00:37:01,590
- We talked about that a while ago.
- Are you still thinking about it?

1114
00:37:01,730 --> 00:37:03,260
- The "world" and...
- Which side dishes do you like?

1115
00:37:03,260 --> 00:37:05,530
It was a while ago
that we talked about side dishes.

1116
00:37:05,530 --> 00:37:07,610
Daniel must secretly
look down on you and me.

1117
00:37:07,610 --> 00:37:09,260
- No, I don't.
- I'm serious.

1118
00:37:09,510 --> 00:37:10,800
I've been feeling it the whole time.

1119
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:12,170
- It's hilarious.
- You find side dishes so funny.

1120
00:37:12,630 --> 00:37:13,840
It's here.

1121
00:37:14,610 --> 00:37:16,050
- Oh, my.
- Oh, my.

1122
00:37:16,050 --> 00:37:17,070
(Their lunch arrives.)

1123
00:37:17,980 --> 00:37:19,610
Our lunch is here. But I'm full.

1124
00:37:19,610 --> 00:37:20,940
I haven't had Chinese food
for a while.

1125
00:37:21,050 --> 00:37:22,090
- These days...
- I ordered...

1126
00:37:22,090 --> 00:37:23,110
braised seafood and vegetables.

1127
00:37:23,110 --> 00:37:24,590
She ordered
braised seafood and vegetables.

1128
00:37:24,590 --> 00:37:26,490
We ordered tangsuyuk.

1129
00:37:26,610 --> 00:37:28,380
I ordered braised seafood
and vegetables with rice.

1130
00:37:28,380 --> 00:37:29,860
She ordered braised seafood
and vegetables with rice.

1131
00:37:30,490 --> 00:37:32,550
My mom is pickier than I thought.

1132
00:37:32,820 --> 00:37:34,670
(I want braised seafood
and vegetables.)

1133
00:37:34,670 --> 00:37:35,920
Let's eat.

1134
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:37,070
Thank you for the meal.

1135
00:37:37,840 --> 00:37:39,490
- The fried rice tastes good.
- It tastes good, right?

1136
00:37:39,490 --> 00:37:40,630
It tastes really good.

1137
00:37:40,630 --> 00:37:42,130
It tastes amazing. I love it.

1138
00:37:42,460 --> 00:37:43,740
That jjajangmyeon looks amazing.

1139
00:37:45,280 --> 00:37:46,440
What did you say?

1140
00:37:46,570 --> 00:37:47,900
That jjajangmyeon looks amazing.

1141
00:37:47,900 --> 00:37:48,900
(She speaks softly.)

1142
00:37:49,050 --> 00:37:50,170
Hey.

1143
00:37:50,170 --> 00:37:52,480
When Il Hwa sees jjajangmyeon,
she says,

1144
00:37:52,670 --> 00:37:54,340
"That jjajangmyeon looks amazing."

1145
00:37:54,990 --> 00:37:56,780
- Then you have to open it?
- I have to do everything for her.

1146
00:37:56,780 --> 00:37:57,880
You're her son.

1147
00:37:57,880 --> 00:37:59,510
- You're her real son.
- I'm her real son.

1148
00:37:59,510 --> 00:38:00,730
She doesn't tell you to open it.

1149
00:38:00,730 --> 00:38:03,050
- Thank you for lunch.
- Right.

1150
00:38:03,050 --> 00:38:05,550
Because they want to make us full
so that we can't eat rice cakes.

1151
00:38:07,030 --> 00:38:08,460
(It's to prevent them from reducing
the amount of their rice cakes.)

1152
00:38:08,460 --> 00:38:09,630
Is that why they're feeding us?

1153
00:38:09,630 --> 00:38:11,740
- That's right.
- That makes sense.

1154
00:38:11,840 --> 00:38:13,900
Daniel is smarter
than the rest of us.

1155
00:38:15,210 --> 00:38:16,740
None of us realized that.

1156
00:38:16,740 --> 00:38:18,210
We were just happy to eat.

1157
00:38:18,630 --> 00:38:21,050
So Min said it,
but Suk Jin compliments Daniel.

1158
00:38:21,880 --> 00:38:23,210
- So Min said it?
- Yes.

1159
00:38:23,380 --> 00:38:25,070
- Let's pretend Daniel said it.
- It was a woman's voice.

1160
00:38:26,170 --> 00:38:27,380
It was a woman's voice.

1161
00:38:28,510 --> 00:38:30,490
(Why is he laughing?)

1162
00:38:30,490 --> 00:38:31,880
- What?
- Did you just see that?

1163
00:38:33,550 --> 00:38:36,190
Suk Jin wanted Se Chan
to give him some tangsuyuk.

1164
00:38:36,190 --> 00:38:38,960
He gave Se Chan this plate
without saying anything,

1165
00:38:38,960 --> 00:38:40,590
and Se Chan just put it down
on the table.

1166
00:38:40,590 --> 00:38:41,860
(Se Chan just put it down
on the table.)

1167
00:38:42,960 --> 00:38:45,030
(A moment ago)

1168
00:38:45,030 --> 00:38:47,090
(Give me some tangsuyuk.)

1169
00:38:47,090 --> 00:38:48,130
(Se Chan puts the plate down.)

1170
00:38:48,130 --> 00:38:49,260
Can you...

1171
00:38:49,760 --> 00:38:51,030
Can you give me some tangsuyuk?

1172
00:38:52,010 --> 00:38:53,110
Hey.

1173
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:55,710
- We're brothers.
- You're the youngest one.

1174
00:38:55,780 --> 00:38:58,320
- Still, give me some tangsuyuk.
- The youngest one can have some.

1175
00:38:58,420 --> 00:39:00,610
Mom didn't raise us like this.

1176
00:39:02,150 --> 00:39:04,460
(He gets just one piece.)

1177
00:39:04,820 --> 00:39:06,150
- I'll give you more.
- Okay.

1178
00:39:06,210 --> 00:39:07,530
Mi Sun is nicer to me.

1179
00:39:07,530 --> 00:39:09,460
Mom, be nice to your son!

1180
00:39:10,230 --> 00:39:12,460
Mi Sun is nicer to me than you are.

1181
00:39:14,170 --> 00:39:15,920
- What could it be?
- Rock-paper-scissors?

1182
00:39:16,860 --> 00:39:18,670
- Did you enjoy your lunch?
- Yes!

1183
00:39:18,670 --> 00:39:20,090
- It was delicious.
- I'm full!

1184
00:39:20,090 --> 00:39:21,400
We can't eat any rice cakes anymore.

1185
00:39:22,110 --> 00:39:25,510
- We can't.
- We're going to perform a mission.

1186
00:39:25,510 --> 00:39:26,840
The first mission is...

1187
00:39:27,240 --> 00:39:28,340
Yang Se Chan Game.

1188
00:39:28,980 --> 00:39:30,570
- I know what it is.
- Is there such a game?

1189
00:39:30,820 --> 00:39:32,820
It's the game where you have a name
on your cap and sound stupid.

1190
00:39:32,820 --> 00:39:33,940
(This is how
Yang Se Chan Game works.)

1191
00:39:34,920 --> 00:39:39,150
(You're to guess
the name on your cap.)

1192
00:39:39,150 --> 00:39:43,550
(You can ask
the other player questions.)

1193
00:39:44,690 --> 00:39:48,960
(It's important to ask
the right questions.)

1194
00:39:49,490 --> 00:39:50,670
(Se Chan gave
many hilarious wrong answers.)

1195
00:39:50,670 --> 00:39:52,170
It's called Yang Se Chan Game?

1196
00:39:53,190 --> 00:39:54,510
According to the order in which
you provide correct answers,

1197
00:39:54,510 --> 00:39:56,860
the team that answers first
gets one rice cake,

1198
00:39:56,860 --> 00:39:58,400
the team in second place gets two,

1199
00:39:58,400 --> 00:39:59,800
and the team at the bottom
gets four.

1200
00:39:59,800 --> 00:40:01,210
- Four?
- Four?

1201
00:40:02,380 --> 00:40:04,570
(The team at the bottom
gets 4 rice cakes.)

1202
00:40:04,570 --> 00:40:06,210
The rice cakes will be
handed out after each round.

1203
00:40:06,210 --> 00:40:07,380
We definitely don't want to
end up at the bottom.

1204
00:40:07,710 --> 00:40:08,710
By the way,

1205
00:40:08,710 --> 00:40:10,490
Young Hee,
do you understand the rules?

1206
00:40:10,490 --> 00:40:12,380
Not completely.

1207
00:40:13,320 --> 00:40:14,780
I asked Il Hwa, and she said,

1208
00:40:15,230 --> 00:40:16,530
"I don't, but I'll do my best."

1209
00:40:17,860 --> 00:40:20,460
(She still sounds elegant.)

1210
00:40:20,990 --> 00:40:22,320
She's honest.

1211
00:40:22,920 --> 00:40:24,130
(Who will play first?)

1212
00:40:24,130 --> 00:40:25,240
Who should go first?

1213
00:40:25,240 --> 00:40:26,900
- Should the stupid ones go first?
- All right.

1214
00:40:26,900 --> 00:40:29,440
- The impact...
- It's too strong.

1215
00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:31,440
Ji Hyo was just so cute.

1216
00:40:31,800 --> 00:40:33,780
When he said,
"Should the stupid ones go first?"

1217
00:40:34,070 --> 00:40:35,070
she said, "Should I go first?"

1218
00:40:35,070 --> 00:40:37,650
(Ji Hyo said, "Should I go first?")

1219
00:40:38,380 --> 00:40:39,880
That was cute.

1220
00:40:39,880 --> 00:40:41,240
Should the stupid ones go first?

1221
00:40:41,510 --> 00:40:42,710
Should I go first?

1222
00:40:42,710 --> 00:40:44,510
(Should I go first?)

1223
00:40:45,090 --> 00:40:46,590
- Do you admit it?
- That was cute.

1224
00:40:46,590 --> 00:40:47,780
Ji Hyo...

1225
00:40:47,780 --> 00:40:49,990
- That was cute.
- Ji Hyo is a candidate.

1226
00:40:50,360 --> 00:40:52,130
Se Chan will represent us.

1227
00:40:52,300 --> 00:40:54,420
(Se Chan represents Team Il Hwa.)

1228
00:40:54,630 --> 00:40:57,260
- Here comes Ji Hyo!
- Our Ji Hyo!

1229
00:40:57,460 --> 00:40:59,990
- Shouldn't Kwang Soo play?
- Do you want to play?

1230
00:41:00,190 --> 00:41:01,670
They're the stupidest ones among us.

1231
00:41:01,800 --> 00:41:03,110
I watch the news these days.

1232
00:41:03,940 --> 00:41:07,280
I'll show you
the flames of questions.

1233
00:41:08,440 --> 00:41:09,980
The "flames of questions"?

1234
00:41:10,380 --> 00:41:12,510
Shouldn't you say
"proper questions"?

1235
00:41:12,510 --> 00:41:13,650
I'll show you "proper questions."

1236
00:41:13,940 --> 00:41:15,320
The "flames of questions"?

1237
00:41:15,610 --> 00:41:16,990
Close your eyes.

1238
00:41:16,990 --> 00:41:18,150
(The names are revealed.)

1239
00:41:18,150 --> 00:41:19,190
All right.

1240
00:41:19,380 --> 00:41:20,460
(English actor Charlie Chaplin)

1241
00:41:20,460 --> 00:41:22,090
- That's hard.
- That's what he got.

1242
00:41:22,460 --> 00:41:23,990
- That's hard.
- Oh, my.

1243
00:41:24,820 --> 00:41:26,130
(Hong Gil Dong)

1244
00:41:26,130 --> 00:41:28,030
- Gosh.
- It's not bad.

1245
00:41:28,760 --> 00:41:30,300
- Are you done?
- Oh, my.

1246
00:41:30,940 --> 00:41:33,990
(Bong Joon Ho, the genius filmmaker
who won 4 Academy Awards)

1247
00:41:33,990 --> 00:41:35,170
Hold on.

1248
00:41:36,510 --> 00:41:37,710
(They see each other's names.)

1249
00:41:37,710 --> 00:41:39,010
Those are the names you have?

1250
00:41:39,070 --> 00:41:41,300
- They're all pretty easy.
- They're easy.

1251
00:41:42,340 --> 00:41:43,550
Is it a man or a woman?

1252
00:41:43,550 --> 00:41:45,070
(Is it a man or a woman?)

1253
00:41:45,070 --> 00:41:46,570
(Well...)

1254
00:41:46,570 --> 00:41:47,690
- You can tell her that much.
- Hey.

1255
00:41:47,690 --> 00:41:49,010
- Why are you hesitating?
- I mean...

1256
00:41:49,010 --> 00:41:51,360
(He doesn't want
to give her a hint.)

1257
00:41:51,360 --> 00:41:52,380
Why are you hesitating?

1258
00:41:52,380 --> 00:41:53,860
- Why are you hesitating?
- I'm sorry.

1259
00:41:53,920 --> 00:41:56,130
- I'm sorry. It's been so long.
- I can't believe you.

1260
00:41:56,130 --> 00:41:57,320
I'm sorry.

1261
00:41:57,900 --> 00:41:59,760
Once you're in the game,
you can't help it.

1262
00:41:59,900 --> 00:42:01,320
- It's a man.
- It's a man?

1263
00:42:01,730 --> 00:42:03,320
(Charlie Chaplin)

1264
00:42:03,320 --> 00:42:05,990
Have you seen this person
in real life?

1265
00:42:05,990 --> 00:42:07,610
- In real life...
- If they've met the person?

1266
00:42:07,610 --> 00:42:08,840
- Have you met this person?
- In real life?

1267
00:42:09,460 --> 00:42:11,110
- If I've met him?
- Yes, in real life.

1268
00:42:11,280 --> 00:42:13,340
Not just in books or on TV,
but in real life.

1269
00:42:13,340 --> 00:42:14,340
(Laughing)

1270
00:42:15,300 --> 00:42:16,840
(Laughing)

1271
00:42:17,170 --> 00:42:19,070
He's pretending to be sharp.
Did you see his face?

1272
00:42:20,010 --> 00:42:21,610
Have you ever seen this person
in real life?

1273
00:42:22,510 --> 00:42:23,740
Have you ever seen this person
in real life?

1274
00:42:23,740 --> 00:42:25,110
(He crosses his legs.)

1275
00:42:25,110 --> 00:42:27,190
- He looks so confident.
- Answer my question clearly.

1276
00:42:27,190 --> 00:42:28,490
Don't think you can avoid it.

1277
00:42:28,490 --> 00:42:29,920
No, I haven't yet.

1278
00:42:29,920 --> 00:42:30,990
- You haven't?
- No.

1279
00:42:30,990 --> 00:42:32,860
That sounds like
you're not going to meet him ever.

1280
00:42:32,860 --> 00:42:35,590
- Okay, Ji Hyo.
- Gosh.

1281
00:42:35,760 --> 00:42:37,230
That was sharp.

1282
00:42:37,230 --> 00:42:40,260
- He sounds like a detective.
- The stupid ones are debating.

1283
00:42:40,260 --> 00:42:41,400
My goodness.

1284
00:42:41,570 --> 00:42:42,940
Have you seen this person
in real life?

1285
00:42:43,130 --> 00:42:44,240
I have.

1286
00:42:44,240 --> 00:42:45,610
- In real life?
- Yes.

1287
00:42:45,710 --> 00:42:47,280
- I have.
- It's possible.

1288
00:42:47,280 --> 00:42:49,280
- In real life?
- I have.

1289
00:42:49,280 --> 00:42:51,010
I really have.

1290
00:42:51,010 --> 00:42:52,050
Seriously?

1291
00:42:52,550 --> 00:42:55,240
Even the cameramen look puzzled.

1292
00:42:55,240 --> 00:42:57,050
- Are you sure you have?
- Yes.

1293
00:42:57,050 --> 00:42:58,050
Okay.

1294
00:42:58,360 --> 00:42:59,760
What is this person's occupation?

1295
00:42:59,760 --> 00:43:02,090
(What is this person's occupation?)

1296
00:43:02,090 --> 00:43:03,420
(He looks Kwang Soo
straight in the eye.)

1297
00:43:03,420 --> 00:43:04,550
Good job.

1298
00:43:05,400 --> 00:43:06,460
Good job.

1299
00:43:06,630 --> 00:43:07,990
Am I better at this now?

1300
00:43:07,990 --> 00:43:09,530
What do you think? Am I better?

1301
00:43:10,630 --> 00:43:11,860
What is this person's occupation?

1302
00:43:11,860 --> 00:43:13,530
(I can't believe Se Chan
asked that sharp question.)

1303
00:43:13,690 --> 00:43:15,070
First, Ji Hyo, answer me.

1304
00:43:15,070 --> 00:43:16,240
(Sharp)

1305
00:43:16,670 --> 00:43:18,110
This person makes things.

1306
00:43:18,110 --> 00:43:19,440
- What?
- This person makes things.

1307
00:43:20,340 --> 00:43:21,400
This person makes things?

1308
00:43:21,400 --> 00:43:22,440
Like food?

1309
00:43:23,050 --> 00:43:25,070
This person makes food? Okay.

1310
00:43:25,550 --> 00:43:27,320
- For now,
- He's so sharp.

1311
00:43:27,380 --> 00:43:29,320
Baek Jong Won is on my radar.

1312
00:43:29,320 --> 00:43:31,210
(Baek Jong Won is on my radar.)

1313
00:43:31,650 --> 00:43:32,920
Let's move on.

1314
00:43:34,320 --> 00:43:36,050
(This is why this game is called
Yang Se Chan Game.)

1315
00:43:36,050 --> 00:43:38,420
That's a good guess.

1316
00:43:38,800 --> 00:43:39,900
Next.

1317
00:43:40,530 --> 00:43:41,800
What is this person's nationality?

1318
00:43:41,800 --> 00:43:43,300
(What is this person's nationality?)

1319
00:43:43,300 --> 00:43:44,400
(Kwang Soo asks a sharp question.)

1320
00:43:44,400 --> 00:43:45,690
Don't just say
this person is a foreigner.

1321
00:43:45,860 --> 00:43:47,090
Give me this person's
specific nationality.

1322
00:43:47,400 --> 00:43:48,670
- You don't know it, do you?
- I don't.

1323
00:43:48,670 --> 00:43:50,170
(Confident)

1324
00:43:50,900 --> 00:43:52,880
She doesn't know it,
but she looks so cool.

1325
00:43:52,880 --> 00:43:54,070
- I really don't.
- What's this person's nationality?

1326
00:43:54,740 --> 00:43:55,940
- This person...
- I'm sure Se Chan doesn't know.

1327
00:43:55,940 --> 00:43:57,300
I know it exactly.

1328
00:43:57,300 --> 00:43:58,440
- What is it?
- What is it?

1329
00:43:58,570 --> 00:44:02,090
(Charlie Chaplin is
an English actor.)

1330
00:44:02,510 --> 00:44:03,820
He's either from East Germany
or West Germany.

1331
00:44:03,820 --> 00:44:07,490
(He's either from East Germany
or West Germany.)

1332
00:44:08,530 --> 00:44:09,550
He's from around there.

1333
00:44:09,630 --> 00:44:11,920
- You're right. I get it now.
- Right?

1334
00:44:11,920 --> 00:44:15,090
It makes sense.
I know what you mean.

1335
00:44:15,090 --> 00:44:16,960
- I know what he means.
- I get it.

1336
00:44:16,960 --> 00:44:18,590
- I get it.
- That's all I can say.

1337
00:44:18,590 --> 00:44:19,800
Is he from the Soviet Union period?

1338
00:44:19,800 --> 00:44:23,030
- Within my knowledge,
- You're incredible.

1339
00:44:23,030 --> 00:44:24,630
this is all I can tell you.

1340
00:44:25,030 --> 00:44:26,380
He's either from East Germany
or West Germany?

1341
00:44:26,380 --> 00:44:27,670
My goodness.

1342
00:44:27,670 --> 00:44:28,740
Let's go.

1343
00:44:29,710 --> 00:44:31,710
(What should I ask them?)

1344
00:44:32,880 --> 00:44:33,980
His occupation.

1345
00:44:35,510 --> 00:44:37,110
- Gosh.
- Come on.

1346
00:44:37,280 --> 00:44:40,050
They have their own questions
they want to ask.

1347
00:44:40,050 --> 00:44:41,780
You should cover your mouth
when you cough.

1348
00:44:41,780 --> 00:44:42,880
(She defends her son.)

1349
00:44:43,230 --> 00:44:44,860
- What do I do for a living?
- Good question.

1350
00:44:45,150 --> 00:44:46,920
She changed the wording
to save her pride.

1351
00:44:46,920 --> 00:44:47,920
(Laughing)

1352
00:44:47,920 --> 00:44:49,490
She is proud. She is proud.

1353
00:44:49,490 --> 00:44:51,170
She changed the wording
to save her pride.

1354
00:44:51,170 --> 00:44:53,490
I did it to make it seem like
I didn't hear you.

1355
00:44:53,490 --> 00:44:55,630
- "What do I do for a living?"
- What do I do for a living?

1356
00:44:56,010 --> 00:44:57,130
They need to answer that.

1357
00:44:57,130 --> 00:44:58,440
Give me the occupation.

1358
00:44:58,630 --> 00:45:01,550
In some people's opinions,

1359
00:45:01,550 --> 00:45:03,670
you do the bad deeds.

1360
00:45:03,670 --> 00:45:06,070
- But they are ultimately good.
- He knows well.

1361
00:45:06,070 --> 00:45:08,990
What do I usually wear?

1362
00:45:08,990 --> 00:45:10,050
(What do I usually wear?)

1363
00:45:10,050 --> 00:45:11,090
What do I usually wear?

1364
00:45:11,090 --> 00:45:12,780
Kwang Soo made a lot of effort.

1365
00:45:12,780 --> 00:45:14,530
- You said East and West Germany.
- The answer is easy.

1366
00:45:14,530 --> 00:45:15,990
- Seriously.
- You mostly wear...

1367
00:45:16,190 --> 00:45:18,860
baggy pants.

1368
00:45:19,550 --> 00:45:21,860
(Baggy pants?)

1369
00:45:22,530 --> 00:45:24,300
- Baggy pants.
- It's true though.

1370
00:45:24,300 --> 00:45:25,670
- Baggy pants.
- It's a big hint.

1371
00:45:25,670 --> 00:45:27,340
- Baggy pants.
- Baggy pants.

1372
00:45:27,490 --> 00:45:29,760
- It's a big hint.
- Seriously.

1373
00:45:29,760 --> 00:45:31,670
Do you know what baggy pants are?

1374
00:45:31,670 --> 00:45:33,740
- Baggy pants?
- Do you know what they are?

1375
00:45:33,740 --> 00:45:35,170
- He gave a big hint.
- Seriously.

1376
00:45:35,170 --> 00:45:36,670
- It's a crucial hint.
- I know.

1377
00:45:36,670 --> 00:45:38,010
- I am...
- He gave a big hint.

1378
00:45:38,010 --> 00:45:39,340
I am an honest person.

1379
00:45:39,340 --> 00:45:42,440
- Ji Hyo, it's your turn to answer.
- What was this called?

1380
00:45:42,440 --> 00:45:43,650
- A bow tie?
- Yes.

1381
00:45:44,340 --> 00:45:46,320
(Kwang Soo, it's a crucial hint!)

1382
00:45:46,320 --> 00:45:47,710
A bow tie.

1383
00:45:47,710 --> 00:45:48,860
(If I combine East Germany,
West Germany, and bow tie...)

1384
00:45:48,860 --> 00:45:50,780
- Pringles?
- Pringles?

1385
00:45:50,860 --> 00:45:52,400
(Pringles)

1386
00:45:53,320 --> 00:45:54,690
You need to say, "Let me answer."

1387
00:45:54,690 --> 00:45:55,760
- Pringles!
- Really?

1388
00:45:56,030 --> 00:45:58,690
The snack you can't stop eating
once it's open?

1389
00:45:59,260 --> 00:46:01,260
The snack you can't stop eating
once it's open.

1390
00:46:01,440 --> 00:46:03,400
Maybe it was made in the time
of East Germany and West Germany.

1391
00:46:03,400 --> 00:46:05,300
- Pringles.
- Seriously.

1392
00:46:05,300 --> 00:46:06,940
Daniel burst out laughing.

1393
00:46:07,570 --> 00:46:09,170
- Daniel.
- My goodness.

1394
00:46:09,170 --> 00:46:11,420
Pringles has a face.

1395
00:46:11,420 --> 00:46:12,980
- The logo.
- It resembles your character.

1396
00:46:12,980 --> 00:46:15,050
- It resembles your character.
- The style.

1397
00:46:15,110 --> 00:46:16,190
Ji Hyo.

1398
00:46:16,380 --> 00:46:18,260
What do I usually wear?

1399
00:46:18,780 --> 00:46:20,260
That's good, my daughter.

1400
00:46:20,260 --> 00:46:21,260
He has a costume.

1401
00:46:21,260 --> 00:46:23,260
His costumes and clothes...

1402
00:46:23,260 --> 00:46:25,650
- Costumes and clothes?
- You mean "features and clothes."

1403
00:46:25,760 --> 00:46:27,320
- Costumes and clothes?
- I understood.

1404
00:46:27,320 --> 00:46:29,300
- You understood, right?
- You only got one word wrong.

1405
00:46:30,400 --> 00:46:32,190
- Costumes and clothes!
- Don't look down on Se Chan.

1406
00:46:32,190 --> 00:46:33,400
(Jae Suk figured it out.)

1407
00:46:33,400 --> 00:46:35,360
You like to wear arm warmers.

1408
00:46:37,440 --> 00:46:38,670
- That's right.
- Really?

1409
00:46:38,670 --> 00:46:40,280
- You are right.
- You wear arm warmers often.

1410
00:46:40,280 --> 00:46:41,480
You like to wear arm warmers.

1411
00:46:41,480 --> 00:46:44,210
I don't think I have seen you
without arm warmers.

1412
00:46:44,550 --> 00:46:47,510
I think I know who I am. Hold on.

1413
00:46:47,510 --> 00:46:49,650
(Did she figure it out?)

1414
00:46:51,010 --> 00:46:54,490
(Someone who does bad deeds
but is ultimately good.)

1415
00:46:54,490 --> 00:46:57,050
(Someone who wears arm warmers)

1416
00:46:57,050 --> 00:46:58,050
Let me answer.

1417
00:46:58,050 --> 00:46:59,090
Hong Gil Dong.

1418
00:46:59,090 --> 00:47:02,900
(Hong Gil Dong)

1419
00:47:02,900 --> 00:47:04,130
It's correct, right?

1420
00:47:04,460 --> 00:47:05,670
It's correct, right?

1421
00:47:05,670 --> 00:47:07,400
- How did you know?
- It's correct, right?

1422
00:47:07,590 --> 00:47:09,530
Arm warmers gave me a hint.

1423
00:47:09,530 --> 00:47:10,900
Why did you tell her that?

1424
00:47:10,900 --> 00:47:14,010
I thought you would say KCM
because of the arm warmers.

1425
00:47:14,380 --> 00:47:15,900
Don't be ridiculous.

1426
00:47:15,900 --> 00:47:17,210
Hong Gil Dong.

1427
00:47:17,740 --> 00:47:18,880
Gosh, Ji Hyo.

1428
00:47:18,880 --> 00:47:20,570
How did she figure it out?
I didn't think she would succeed.

1429
00:47:20,570 --> 00:47:21,880
The rediscovery of Ji Hyo.

1430
00:47:21,880 --> 00:47:23,050
Ji Hyo.

1431
00:47:23,050 --> 00:47:24,880
She is above us.

1432
00:47:25,010 --> 00:47:27,420
- We need fewer rice cakes.
- Seriously.

1433
00:47:27,420 --> 00:47:28,780
Kwang means "Crazy"
and Soo means "Water."

1434
00:47:29,460 --> 00:47:30,960
Se means "World"
and Chan means "Side dishes."

1435
00:47:30,960 --> 00:47:32,730
- So they are crazy side dishes.
- Crazy side dishes.

1436
00:47:33,030 --> 00:47:35,360
Se Chan, go. Ask him a question.

1437
00:47:35,570 --> 00:47:37,820
What did I appear in recently?

1438
00:47:38,670 --> 00:47:40,630
- That's good.
- What did I appear in recently?

1439
00:47:41,210 --> 00:47:43,510
I saw you on SBS.

1440
00:47:44,110 --> 00:47:46,130
(You saw me on SBS?)

1441
00:47:46,780 --> 00:47:48,650
- It makes sense.
- That's right.

1442
00:47:48,740 --> 00:47:51,710
The most personal is
the most creative.

1443
00:47:51,710 --> 00:47:53,840
- I saw you on SBS recently.
- It makes sense.

1444
00:47:53,840 --> 00:47:54,920
(The answer is
the most personal and creative.)

1445
00:47:54,920 --> 00:47:56,510
I saw him on YTN.

1446
00:47:56,510 --> 00:47:58,190
I saw him on every channel.

1447
00:47:58,280 --> 00:48:01,090
That means I am a popular celebrity.

1448
00:48:01,090 --> 00:48:03,050
A popular celebrity?

1449
00:48:03,050 --> 00:48:04,460
- I saw him on Channel A.
- For goodness' sake.

1450
00:48:04,900 --> 00:48:06,920
Do you know your nationality?

1451
00:48:06,920 --> 00:48:08,820
Since I was on SBS,
I must be Korean.

1452
00:48:09,420 --> 00:48:11,590
He became annoyed.
He became annoyed.

1453
00:48:11,940 --> 00:48:13,440
Suk Jin picked the worst timing.

1454
00:48:13,440 --> 00:48:14,940
(Since I was on SBS,
I must be Korean.)

1455
00:48:15,210 --> 00:48:16,840
- Think about it.
- A Korean man.

1456
00:48:16,840 --> 00:48:18,440
- Hold on.
- He got an idea.

1457
00:48:18,440 --> 00:48:19,510
- YTN?
- Yes.

1458
00:48:19,510 --> 00:48:21,070
- YTN, Yonhap News...
- Say your answer.

1459
00:48:21,380 --> 00:48:22,650
- YTN?
- He got an idea.

1460
00:48:22,650 --> 00:48:25,940
- He got an idea.
- Every news channel.

1461
00:48:25,940 --> 00:48:28,280
- He was on every news channel.
- That's right.

1462
00:48:28,380 --> 00:48:29,550
- He got an idea.
- I know who I am.

1463
00:48:29,550 --> 00:48:30,610
- He got an idea.
- Say your answer.

1464
00:48:31,090 --> 00:48:34,550
(Someone who was
on every channel recently)

1465
00:48:35,320 --> 00:48:38,230
Yang Joon Il.

1466
00:48:39,860 --> 00:48:41,190
What are we going to do?

1467
00:48:41,860 --> 00:48:43,530
- For goodness' sake.
- This is driving me crazy.

1468
00:48:43,530 --> 00:48:44,590
Am I wrong?

1469
00:48:45,190 --> 00:48:46,960
- This is driving me crazy.
- Am I wrong?

1470
00:48:47,070 --> 00:48:48,740
- I can't believe it.
- Recently...

1471
00:48:48,740 --> 00:48:49,760
(Sighing)

1472
00:48:49,760 --> 00:48:51,570
- Yang Joon Il?
- He was on every channel!

1473
00:48:51,900 --> 00:48:53,880
- Yang Se Chan Game!
- Yang Se Chan Game!

1474
00:48:53,880 --> 00:48:54,900
(This is why it's
Yang Se Chan Game.)

1475
00:48:54,900 --> 00:48:57,070
- Isn't Yang Joon Il the answer?
- For goodness' sake.

1476
00:48:57,070 --> 00:48:59,240
I am so annoyed.

1477
00:48:59,240 --> 00:49:01,070
- He is unbelievable.
- This is driving me crazy.

1478
00:49:01,320 --> 00:49:02,440
Ask him for the exact occupation.

1479
00:49:02,440 --> 00:49:03,780
- The occupation.
- That's a good idea.

1480
00:49:03,880 --> 00:49:06,280
The winner will get the occupation
that comes up on a search engine.

1481
00:49:07,010 --> 00:49:08,150
<i>- Rock-paper-scissors
- Rock-paper-scissors</i>

1482
00:49:08,150 --> 00:49:09,590
(Se Chan wins!)

1483
00:49:09,590 --> 00:49:11,420
Who am I? I was on every channel.

1484
00:49:11,550 --> 00:49:13,530
I was on Yonhap News, YTN,
and other news channels!

1485
00:49:13,530 --> 00:49:14,730
Tell me. Who am I?

1486
00:49:14,820 --> 00:49:15,900
What's my occupation?

1487
00:49:15,900 --> 00:49:18,360
Tell him.

1488
00:49:20,360 --> 00:49:22,670
He makes movies and dramas.

1489
00:49:23,400 --> 00:49:25,480
- Movies and dramas.
- Tell him!

1490
00:49:25,480 --> 00:49:26,480
(Kwang Soo plays dirty.)

1491
00:49:26,480 --> 00:49:27,570
What?

1492
00:49:27,570 --> 00:49:28,800
Stop acting like
you don't know who he is.

1493
00:49:28,800 --> 00:49:31,650
- Tell me.
- He mostly makes movies.

1494
00:49:31,650 --> 00:49:32,820
He mostly makes movies?

1495
00:49:32,980 --> 00:49:35,190
I took too much of a detour.

1496
00:49:35,190 --> 00:49:36,940
- You twisted it too much.
- I know the answer.

1497
00:49:36,940 --> 00:49:39,380
Let me answer.

1498
00:49:39,380 --> 00:49:40,990
(Will he succeed this time?)

1499
00:49:50,110 --> 00:49:51,650
- Bong Joon Ho.
- That's right.

1500
00:49:51,670 --> 00:49:54,170
(Bong Joon Ho is correct.)

1501
00:49:54,980 --> 00:49:56,980
- That took you long.
- I took too much of a detour.

1502
00:49:56,980 --> 00:49:58,190
Seriously.

1503
00:49:58,420 --> 00:49:59,650
- Who am I?
- You were close.

1504
00:49:59,650 --> 00:50:01,710
- I was close.
- Pringles suited the description.

1505
00:50:02,190 --> 00:50:03,650
You are right.

1506
00:50:03,650 --> 00:50:04,650
(Team Young Hee comes in last!)

1507
00:50:04,860 --> 00:50:07,360
- Now...
- Let's distribute the rice cakes.

1508
00:50:07,360 --> 00:50:08,630
- Rice cakes.
- Moms will bring them.

1509
00:50:08,630 --> 00:50:10,770
- We get one.
- I should get ready to take one.

1510
00:50:10,770 --> 00:50:13,360
Young Hee will distribute
the rice cakes first.

1511
00:50:14,130 --> 00:50:15,290
I am at fault...

1512
00:50:15,730 --> 00:50:16,960
for raising my children wrong.

1513
00:50:16,960 --> 00:50:19,610
But I will raise them strong.

1514
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:21,230
- All of them?
- Me?

1515
00:50:21,230 --> 00:50:23,610
(Kwang Soo gets all the rice cakes.)

1516
00:50:23,850 --> 00:50:25,350
- All of them?
- Me?

1517
00:50:26,150 --> 00:50:27,610
(She knows what to do.)

1518
00:50:27,610 --> 00:50:28,940
All four of them?

1519
00:50:30,110 --> 00:50:31,880
- This is so sudden.
- She is cool.

1520
00:50:31,880 --> 00:50:34,310
- Seriously.
- Young Hee is cool.

1521
00:50:34,310 --> 00:50:36,250
- She did the right thing.
- I agree.

1522
00:50:36,250 --> 00:50:38,480
- It's my fault.
- It was your round.

1523
00:50:38,480 --> 00:50:40,230
If it's your fault, why did I get...

1524
00:50:40,960 --> 00:50:42,460
- I will raise my children strong.
- This is too much.

1525
00:50:42,520 --> 00:50:44,690
Mi Sun is next.

1526
00:50:44,690 --> 00:50:47,330
My daughter should be cherished.

1527
00:50:47,330 --> 00:50:48,790
I will keep this.

1528
00:50:50,190 --> 00:50:52,670
- I will keep this.
- What a loving family!

1529
00:50:53,360 --> 00:50:54,770
Kwang Soo, you can do well.

1530
00:50:54,770 --> 00:50:55,940
I envy Ji Hyo.

1531
00:50:56,330 --> 00:50:59,440
- How heartwarming!
- My daughter did a great job.

1532
00:50:59,440 --> 00:51:01,580
My mom is the best.

1533
00:51:01,580 --> 00:51:03,250
I wish my mom would do the same.

1534
00:51:03,250 --> 00:51:05,040
- Now,
- I wish my mom would do the same.

1535
00:51:05,040 --> 00:51:06,210
Il Hwa.

1536
00:51:07,960 --> 00:51:09,250
(Glancing over)

1537
00:51:09,250 --> 00:51:10,310
What?

1538
00:51:10,960 --> 00:51:12,380
(What?)

1539
00:51:12,380 --> 00:51:14,600
That came out of nowhere.

1540
00:51:14,860 --> 00:51:16,360
She suddenly gave the rice cakes
to Suk Jin.

1541
00:51:16,500 --> 00:51:18,130
- I didn't expect this.
- That came out of nowhere.

1542
00:51:18,330 --> 00:51:20,560
- Suk Jin suddenly got them.
- I thought they were for me.

1543
00:51:20,770 --> 00:51:22,960
- Why did you give them to me?
- Thank you, Mom.

1544
00:51:23,230 --> 00:51:25,210
He didn't even play the game.

1545
00:51:26,270 --> 00:51:27,500
Il Hwa!

1546
00:51:28,400 --> 00:51:30,080
Don't be rude!

1547
00:51:30,080 --> 00:51:31,480
Don't yell at your mom!

1548
00:51:31,480 --> 00:51:33,650
- Don't call your mom by her name.
- What a bad son!

1549
00:51:33,650 --> 00:51:36,150
- Stay in character.
- I am sorry.

1550
00:51:37,040 --> 00:51:39,380
- Thank goodness.
- It's okay.

1551
00:51:39,940 --> 00:51:40,960
(The rice cakes are distributed
after Round 2.)

1552
00:51:40,960 --> 00:51:42,080
That was hilarious.

1553
00:51:42,080 --> 00:51:44,130
Those who haven't gone will play
in the last round.

1554
00:51:44,130 --> 00:51:46,920
- Okay. Me, Jong Kook, and Daniel.
- Daniel.

1555
00:51:47,790 --> 00:51:49,920
Jae Suk knows
which questions to ask.

1556
00:51:49,920 --> 00:51:52,560
- I will show you how it's done.
- Okay.

1557
00:51:52,560 --> 00:51:53,860
Give us the ad-libs.

1558
00:51:53,860 --> 00:51:55,860
I will give you the ad-libs.
All of us are people, right?

1559
00:51:56,560 --> 00:51:57,710
People.

1560
00:51:58,540 --> 00:51:59,710
I see.

1561
00:52:00,230 --> 00:52:01,480
Okay.

1562
00:52:01,480 --> 00:52:03,980
(Jong Kook is Xuanzang,
a monk who travels with Sun Wukong.)

1563
00:52:03,980 --> 00:52:05,000
All of us are people.

1564
00:52:05,750 --> 00:52:07,520
- All of us are people.
- Okay.

1565
00:52:07,520 --> 00:52:10,270
- I get the idea.
- This is hard.

1566
00:52:11,690 --> 00:52:16,080
(The worst villain in the galaxy
who wreaked havoc with a snap.)

1567
00:52:17,630 --> 00:52:20,060
("Thanos" will be difficult.
Will he be able to get it right?)

1568
00:52:20,330 --> 00:52:22,400
Foul play will immediately earn you
a rice cake...

1569
00:52:22,400 --> 00:52:24,170
- since this is the last round.
- Okay.

1570
00:52:24,360 --> 00:52:25,460
Daniel.

1571
00:52:25,630 --> 00:52:27,020
What's my nationality?

1572
00:52:27,960 --> 00:52:29,060
He is...

1573
00:52:29,360 --> 00:52:31,460
It's hard to talk about
his nationality.

1574
00:52:31,460 --> 00:52:33,210
- Give him an approximate.
- He must live in a country.

1575
00:52:33,210 --> 00:52:35,710
An approximate? There is
no such thing in nationality, okay?

1576
00:52:35,980 --> 00:52:37,900
- Why are you angry?
- Don't be ridiculous.

1577
00:52:37,900 --> 00:52:39,400
Don't get angry at Kwang Soo.

1578
00:52:40,310 --> 00:52:42,850
(Kwang Soo becomes upset.)

1579
00:52:43,750 --> 00:52:45,650
You can't talk about
someone's nationality that way.

1580
00:52:45,850 --> 00:52:47,360
- He is...
- You know,

1581
00:52:47,360 --> 00:52:49,360
he has many nationalities.

1582
00:52:49,360 --> 00:52:52,190
Let me tell you this. I can't lie.

1583
00:52:52,190 --> 00:52:53,960
We don't know about his nationality.

1584
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:55,330
- You don't know about it.
- That's right.

1585
00:52:55,330 --> 00:52:56,730
- That's right.
- It's true.

1586
00:52:57,020 --> 00:53:00,730
- From which time period am I?
- Time period.

1587
00:53:00,730 --> 00:53:01,860
- Time period.
- It's a good question.

1588
00:53:01,860 --> 00:53:03,560
- It's a good question.
- It's really good.

1589
00:53:03,900 --> 00:53:05,730
It's difficult to say
what era this is.

1590
00:53:05,730 --> 00:53:07,270
- I agree.
- It's difficult.

1591
00:53:07,270 --> 00:53:08,270
- It's difficult?
- It's hard to say what it is.

1592
00:53:08,270 --> 00:53:10,380
Just tell me roughly.

1593
00:53:10,380 --> 00:53:12,440
- It's not like that.
- I don't need a specific year.

1594
00:53:12,440 --> 00:53:15,040
- That's not what I'm asking.
- Can he do this?

1595
00:53:15,040 --> 00:53:16,480
- He can.
- The era.

1596
00:53:16,520 --> 00:53:19,020
I don't really know this person.

1597
00:53:19,020 --> 00:53:22,560
Even if you don't know them,
you know the setting.

1598
00:53:22,560 --> 00:53:26,330
- What's in the background?
- People are all the same, idiot.

1599
00:53:26,560 --> 00:53:27,650
- That's not true.
- We're all the same.

1600
00:53:27,650 --> 00:53:29,190
- There must be a setting.
- There are water, air,

1601
00:53:29,190 --> 00:53:30,670
mountains, and the sky.

1602
00:53:30,670 --> 00:53:32,130
- Goodness.
- Tell him, Daniel.

1603
00:53:32,130 --> 00:53:33,500
- Let's see what you say.
- Daniel.

1604
00:53:33,500 --> 00:53:35,400
The person is from a long time ago.

1605
00:53:35,400 --> 00:53:37,100
- A long time ago?
- Sure.

1606
00:53:37,100 --> 00:53:38,270
That's true.

1607
00:53:38,440 --> 00:53:40,360
I'll ask about my occupation.

1608
00:53:40,360 --> 00:53:42,210
- What do I do?
- Your occupation?

1609
00:53:42,210 --> 00:53:44,540
This person...

1610
00:53:44,650 --> 00:53:45,880
They're great.

1611
00:53:45,900 --> 00:53:46,940
This person...

1612
00:53:47,480 --> 00:53:51,420
protected somebody for a long time.

1613
00:53:51,920 --> 00:53:53,290
(Lee Bong Won's guardian)

1614
00:53:53,290 --> 00:53:54,360
- Daniel.
- Yes.

1615
00:53:54,360 --> 00:53:56,580
We need something strong.
You don't have an idea yet.

1616
00:53:56,580 --> 00:53:59,690
What's my occupation?

1617
00:54:00,020 --> 00:54:02,460
- That's difficult.
- Occupation?

1618
00:54:02,520 --> 00:54:04,000
This one's hard to answer.

1619
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:06,400
I personally think this person is...

1620
00:54:06,400 --> 00:54:09,730
- a gangster.
- What?

1621
00:54:09,730 --> 00:54:11,130
(This person is a gangster
who destroys people with a finger.)

1622
00:54:11,130 --> 00:54:12,540
- What did you say?
- A gangster.

1623
00:54:12,900 --> 00:54:14,130
- Isn't it true?
- A gangster?

1624
00:54:14,130 --> 00:54:15,480
- He's a gangster.
- I agree.

1625
00:54:15,480 --> 00:54:16,480
I think so.

1626
00:54:16,480 --> 00:54:18,610
- You're right.
- He's a bad boy.

1627
00:54:18,750 --> 00:54:20,210
This person is worse
than a gangster.

1628
00:54:20,210 --> 00:54:21,580
- Very bad.
- Okay.

1629
00:54:21,580 --> 00:54:23,150
- I can't deny that.
- It's true.

1630
00:54:23,150 --> 00:54:24,440
I can't deny that.

1631
00:54:24,650 --> 00:54:26,020
I see.

1632
00:54:26,440 --> 00:54:30,580
Is this person alive?

1633
00:54:30,580 --> 00:54:31,790
(She's right behind them.)

1634
00:54:32,150 --> 00:54:33,380
- This person?
- Yes.

1635
00:54:33,380 --> 00:54:35,150
- Watch what you say.
- Hold on.

1636
00:54:35,290 --> 00:54:36,500
- Why?
- Why?

1637
00:54:36,730 --> 00:54:38,130
- Because...
- Why are you hesitating?

1638
00:54:38,130 --> 00:54:39,420
- You're going to get a warning.
- This is too...

1639
00:54:39,420 --> 00:54:40,830
- Why are you hesitating?
- You have to give me an answer.

1640
00:54:40,830 --> 00:54:42,500
- Is this person alive right now?
- Yes.

1641
00:54:42,500 --> 00:54:43,600
You are hesitating?

1642
00:54:43,670 --> 00:54:46,960
- Yes, I would say so.
- You would say so?

1643
00:54:47,540 --> 00:54:48,730
- You would say so?
- I would.

1644
00:54:48,730 --> 00:54:50,130
- So they're alive?
- Sure.

1645
00:54:50,130 --> 00:54:51,350
Daniel.

1646
00:54:51,400 --> 00:54:55,250
What kind of outfit
do they usually wear?

1647
00:54:55,250 --> 00:54:58,690
This person?
What I saw mostly was...

1648
00:54:58,690 --> 00:55:00,420
- a sleeveless shirt.
- True.

1649
00:55:00,420 --> 00:55:01,480
It was a sleeveless shirt.

1650
00:55:01,480 --> 00:55:03,110
I guess it's a sleeveless shirt.

1651
00:55:03,110 --> 00:55:04,150
It's a sleeveless shirt?

1652
00:55:04,150 --> 00:55:05,480
- It is.
- It's true.

1653
00:55:05,480 --> 00:55:07,060
- He's not wrong.
- Isn't it a sleeveless shirt?

1654
00:55:07,060 --> 00:55:08,520
- It is.
- I was right.

1655
00:55:08,520 --> 00:55:10,420
They like tight-fitting clothes.

1656
00:55:10,420 --> 00:55:11,730
- They like it tight-fitted.
- True.

1657
00:55:11,730 --> 00:55:13,290
I agree. It's not loose.

1658
00:55:13,290 --> 00:55:17,190
Is this person not from Earth?

1659
00:55:17,190 --> 00:55:18,210
They like tight-fitting clothes.

1660
00:55:18,210 --> 00:55:19,830
- Is this person not from Earth?
- He's narrowing it down.

1661
00:55:19,830 --> 00:55:21,540
Well...

1662
00:55:22,040 --> 00:55:23,480
This person is...

1663
00:55:23,480 --> 00:55:25,400
What are...

1664
00:55:25,400 --> 00:55:27,380
this person's features?
Their overall features.

1665
00:55:27,380 --> 00:55:28,540
That's a good question.

1666
00:55:28,770 --> 00:55:31,440
This person likes
loose-fitting clothes.

1667
00:55:31,440 --> 00:55:34,210
I think they're kind of hip.

1668
00:55:34,880 --> 00:55:36,750
- They're hip?
- Right.

1669
00:55:36,750 --> 00:55:37,750
- I agree.
- They're hip.

1670
00:55:37,750 --> 00:55:39,580
I think they wear a hanbok.

1671
00:55:39,580 --> 00:55:40,580
Daniel.

1672
00:55:41,060 --> 00:55:43,730
Is this person an alien?

1673
00:55:44,500 --> 00:55:46,830
An alien? Hold on.

1674
00:55:47,940 --> 00:55:49,560
Wait. Hold on.

1675
00:55:49,560 --> 00:55:50,940
- This is...
- No, no.

1676
00:55:50,940 --> 00:55:52,560
- When...
- I'm not sure.

1677
00:55:52,560 --> 00:55:54,540
there is a good question,
we're like...

1678
00:55:54,540 --> 00:55:56,110
(They inhale, look away,
and flinch.)

1679
00:55:56,110 --> 00:55:57,650
What are you looking at?

1680
00:55:57,650 --> 00:55:58,940
- An alien?
- No, they're not an alien.

1681
00:55:58,940 --> 00:56:00,110
What are you looking at?

1682
00:56:00,110 --> 00:56:01,380
Good question.

1683
00:56:01,380 --> 00:56:03,250
Are they an alien? Wait.

1684
00:56:03,250 --> 00:56:06,380
Some people might mistake them
for an alien.

1685
00:56:06,750 --> 00:56:08,290
- I agree.
- You could be mistaken.

1686
00:56:08,290 --> 00:56:09,750
- I agree.
- It's possible.

1687
00:56:09,750 --> 00:56:11,650
It is. They go back and forth.

1688
00:56:11,650 --> 00:56:13,380
It's not for certain.

1689
00:56:13,380 --> 00:56:14,460
That was sharp.

1690
00:56:14,460 --> 00:56:15,460
Let me answer.

1691
00:56:15,460 --> 00:56:16,500
(Let me answer!)

1692
00:56:16,500 --> 00:56:17,520
Let me answer.

1693
00:56:17,520 --> 00:56:21,190
(Unknown nationality, gangster,
sleeveless shirt, and an alien)

1694
00:56:21,190 --> 00:56:24,130
(Can he guess Thanos
with just 4 pieces of information?)

1695
00:56:24,130 --> 00:56:25,330
Thanos?

1696
00:56:25,360 --> 00:56:26,440
(Thanos?)

1697
00:56:26,440 --> 00:56:27,670
(Correct)

1698
00:56:27,670 --> 00:56:28,900
How did you know?

1699
00:56:28,900 --> 00:56:29,940
- How did you know?
- How did he know?

1700
00:56:29,940 --> 00:56:31,150
Sleeveless shirt.

1701
00:56:31,500 --> 00:56:33,650
- How did he know?
- That was amazing.

1702
00:56:33,650 --> 00:56:34,770
He goes back and forth.

1703
00:56:34,770 --> 00:56:36,420
He had great questions.

1704
00:56:36,420 --> 00:56:38,310
- I thought Thanos was a dinosaur.
- Do you like superheroes?

1705
00:56:38,310 --> 00:56:39,480
Me too.

1706
00:56:39,480 --> 00:56:41,210
- That was amazing.
- I didn't think he would be right.

1707
00:56:41,210 --> 00:56:42,810
Good job.

1708
00:56:42,860 --> 00:56:45,250
I thought ours was
the most difficult.

1709
00:56:45,250 --> 00:56:47,690
- Hold on.
- This person wears a hanbok.

1710
00:56:48,020 --> 00:56:51,190
Does this person have
a special hairstyle?

1711
00:56:52,130 --> 00:56:53,270
Good question.

1712
00:56:53,400 --> 00:56:54,730
(Chuckling)

1713
00:56:54,730 --> 00:56:56,500
- Why?
- What are you looking at?

1714
00:56:56,500 --> 00:56:57,940
- Jae Suk.
- There is one.

1715
00:56:57,940 --> 00:56:59,110
- You have to tell him.
- Answer.

1716
00:56:59,110 --> 00:57:00,110
Bring your voices down. Have a seat.

1717
00:57:00,110 --> 00:57:01,500
- He'll answer.
- Sit down.

1718
00:57:01,500 --> 00:57:03,830
- Fine.
- Tell me in two minutes.

1719
00:57:03,830 --> 00:57:05,350
You can't say it otherwise.
The hairstyle.

1720
00:57:05,350 --> 00:57:07,310
- You have to say it.
- They have something on their head.

1721
00:57:07,310 --> 00:57:09,110
- What?
- There's something on their head.

1722
00:57:09,150 --> 00:57:11,150
- True.
- They wear something on their head.

1723
00:57:11,150 --> 00:57:12,480
- They do?
- Yes.

1724
00:57:12,480 --> 00:57:13,520
Let me answer.

1725
00:57:14,420 --> 00:57:17,460
(It's an old person with loose-fit
clothes and something on the head.)

1726
00:57:17,460 --> 00:57:18,520
Sun Wukong?

1727
00:57:19,330 --> 00:57:21,060
(Incorrect)

1728
00:57:21,600 --> 00:57:23,330
(Goodness)

1729
00:57:24,460 --> 00:57:25,460
(Sighing)

1730
00:57:25,460 --> 00:57:26,520
What was that?

1731
00:57:26,900 --> 00:57:28,730
(He couldn't hide it.)

1732
00:57:28,730 --> 00:57:29,790
What was that?

1733
00:57:30,940 --> 00:57:32,130
Daniel.

1734
00:57:32,130 --> 00:57:33,560
- Sit straight.
- What's wrong?

1735
00:57:33,560 --> 00:57:35,040
What's wrong, Jae Suk?

1736
00:57:35,040 --> 00:57:36,040
- Why are you here?
- Have some water.

1737
00:57:36,040 --> 00:57:37,750
- What's wrong?
- Have some water.

1738
00:57:37,750 --> 00:57:39,150
It's not over yet.

1739
00:57:39,900 --> 00:57:41,650
(He drinks some water
and calms down.)

1740
00:57:42,420 --> 00:57:44,210
(It's Jae Suk's turn to
ask a question.)

1741
00:57:44,210 --> 00:57:45,350
- Well.
- Okay.

1742
00:57:45,850 --> 00:57:47,150
How many characters are
in my name?

1743
00:57:47,150 --> 00:57:48,790
- Sorry?
- How long is the name?

1744
00:57:48,790 --> 00:57:50,110
Yes, how many characters are there?

1745
00:57:50,110 --> 00:57:51,560
- 2 characters?
- 2?

1746
00:57:51,560 --> 00:57:52,690
- Yes.
- What?

1747
00:57:52,690 --> 00:57:54,150
- That's just the first name.
- Right.

1748
00:57:54,150 --> 00:57:56,420
Hey.

1749
00:57:56,420 --> 00:57:58,130
- Why?
- What's wrong?

1750
00:57:58,130 --> 00:58:00,400
That was my strategy.
You can't say that.

1751
00:58:00,400 --> 00:58:01,540
Because...

1752
00:58:01,540 --> 00:58:02,630
These people.

1753
00:58:02,630 --> 00:58:03,900
He deserves a rice cake.

1754
00:58:03,900 --> 00:58:06,210
He only asked for the name,
so that's what I told him.

1755
00:58:06,210 --> 00:58:07,330
Hey!

1756
00:58:07,330 --> 00:58:08,940
Look at that.

1757
00:58:09,540 --> 00:58:11,540
- Goodness.
- I got this for telling you.

1758
00:58:11,540 --> 00:58:12,900
He got a rice cake.

1759
00:58:12,900 --> 00:58:14,040
- I still told you.
- Jae Suk,

1760
00:58:14,040 --> 00:58:15,540
you have to get this right.

1761
00:58:15,650 --> 00:58:16,850
Let me ask a question.

1762
00:58:16,850 --> 00:58:18,610
Jong Kook.

1763
00:58:19,110 --> 00:58:21,380
(Jong Kook is confident.
Jae Suk is down.)

1764
00:58:21,380 --> 00:58:22,380
Go ahead.

1765
00:58:24,060 --> 00:58:25,750
- Is he best friends...
- Go on.

1766
00:58:25,860 --> 00:58:27,520
with Sun Wukong?

1767
00:58:27,520 --> 00:58:29,460
(Teasing)

1768
00:58:29,460 --> 00:58:33,270
(They go to the temple together.)

1769
00:58:33,900 --> 00:58:36,330
(Jong Kook's decisive question)

1770
00:58:37,810 --> 00:58:40,940
(He cools himself down with water.)

1771
00:58:42,380 --> 00:58:45,040
They're not.

1772
00:58:45,040 --> 00:58:46,110
- They are not?
- No?

1773
00:58:46,110 --> 00:58:47,480
- I thought they were best friends.
- They are not.

1774
00:58:47,480 --> 00:58:48,770
- Be honest.
- They're not best friends.

1775
00:58:48,770 --> 00:58:49,940
You shouldn't do anything wrong
to this guy.

1776
00:58:49,940 --> 00:58:51,150
They're not best friends.

1777
00:58:51,150 --> 00:58:52,850
You never know
what they're thinking.

1778
00:58:52,850 --> 00:58:54,420
- Don't do anything wrong.
- You never know.

1779
00:58:54,420 --> 00:58:55,790
- You don't know what people think.
- Is that right?

1780
00:58:55,790 --> 00:58:57,380
- You never know.
- Are they not close?

1781
00:58:57,380 --> 00:58:59,650
Jong Kook's harassing him.

1782
00:58:59,650 --> 00:59:01,360
Just throw the white towel.

1783
00:59:01,360 --> 00:59:02,520
Keep going. One more time.

1784
00:59:02,520 --> 00:59:04,130
- I can't keep watching.
- I'll get it right.

1785
00:59:04,130 --> 00:59:06,130
- Keep going.
- Are you sure?

1786
00:59:06,290 --> 00:59:07,600
Let me answer.

1787
00:59:09,230 --> 00:59:10,360
Xuanzang.

1788
00:59:10,830 --> 00:59:13,400
(Correct)

1789
00:59:13,400 --> 00:59:16,730
(Team Mi Sun is 2nd place
and gets 2 rice cakes.)

1790
00:59:17,380 --> 00:59:19,580
- How did you know?
- How?

1791
00:59:19,880 --> 00:59:21,350
Yours was hard.

1792
00:59:21,350 --> 00:59:22,480
It was hard.

1793
00:59:22,480 --> 00:59:23,940
Let's distribute the rice cakes.

1794
00:59:23,940 --> 00:59:25,810
I got one during this game.

1795
00:59:26,110 --> 00:59:27,150
That was his fault.

1796
00:59:27,150 --> 00:59:28,380
One each.

1797
00:59:28,380 --> 00:59:30,690
(Handing over)

1798
00:59:30,690 --> 00:59:31,920
(Se Chan gets all 4.)

1799
00:59:31,920 --> 00:59:33,880
Mother, all four for me?

1800
00:59:33,960 --> 00:59:35,290
What for?

1801
00:59:35,290 --> 00:59:37,330
What's wrong with our mom?

1802
00:59:37,330 --> 00:59:38,630
- Why? Out of nowhere.
- Our mom.

1803
00:59:38,630 --> 00:59:39,630
She just gave me four.

1804
00:59:39,630 --> 00:59:41,040
(The other teams distributed
the rice cakes as well.)

1805
00:59:41,040 --> 00:59:42,290
(Current Number of Rice Cakes)

1806
00:59:42,290 --> 00:59:44,900
(Team Young Hee,
Team Mi Sun, Team Il Hwa)

1807
00:59:45,310 --> 00:59:48,730
This is the final mission where
moms and kids must work together.

1808
00:59:48,730 --> 00:59:50,900
It's called Mom's Back Slap.

1809
00:59:51,750 --> 00:59:55,810
We hid two name tags
for each member.

1810
00:59:55,940 --> 00:59:59,150
You must find somebody else's
name tag, stick it on your back,

1811
00:59:59,150 --> 01:00:01,290
and get slapped in the back
by your mom...

1812
01:00:01,290 --> 01:00:03,150
in order to give rice cakes to
the person on the name tag.

1813
01:00:03,150 --> 01:00:04,690
(Find somebody else's name tag
and get slapped in the back.)

1814
01:00:05,060 --> 01:00:06,690
We have to find
other people's name tags.

1815
01:00:06,690 --> 01:00:09,420
For the moms, they can only
rip off name tags of other moms.

1816
01:00:09,420 --> 01:00:11,770
If a mom gets
their name tag ripped off,

1817
01:00:11,770 --> 01:00:14,400
we'll add two more name tags
for their children.

1818
01:00:14,830 --> 01:00:16,290
We have to protect our mom.

1819
01:00:16,290 --> 01:00:18,040
Meanwhile, Kwang Soo will...

1820
01:00:18,460 --> 01:00:21,110
be cutting rice cakes
at a designated spot.

1821
01:00:22,770 --> 01:00:24,480
I have to cut rice cakes?

1822
01:00:24,480 --> 01:00:26,670
Yes, once somebody gets
slapped in the back by their mom,

1823
01:00:26,670 --> 01:00:32,150
they will get as much rice cake
Kwang Soo has cut by that time.

1824
01:00:32,650 --> 01:00:34,750
- Oh, dear.
- Is it by weight?

1825
01:00:34,750 --> 01:00:36,250
- I can get the rice cakes too.
- Of course.

1826
01:00:36,250 --> 01:00:37,790
- You can get some too.
- I won't know who it's for.

1827
01:00:37,790 --> 01:00:39,290
You have to be smart about it.

1828
01:00:39,290 --> 01:00:40,960
- Exactly.
- I can't just keep cutting.

1829
01:00:40,960 --> 01:00:42,630
You can give the rice cakes
to your own team too.

1830
01:00:42,630 --> 01:00:43,730
Right.

1831
01:00:43,730 --> 01:00:45,860
- Let's get started.
- Yes, buddy.

1832
01:00:46,020 --> 01:00:47,020
(Which team will smile at the end?)

1833
01:00:47,020 --> 01:00:49,500
Ji Hyo and Jong Kook will do
everything, mom.

1834
01:00:49,500 --> 01:00:52,330
- I know. I'm going to stay still.
- Just stay still.

1835
01:00:52,330 --> 01:00:55,230
You can win without a drop of sweat.

1836
01:00:55,310 --> 01:00:56,940
- Really?
- Yes, for sure.

1837
01:00:56,940 --> 01:00:58,440
I feel reassured.

1838
01:00:58,670 --> 01:01:00,400
They're specialized
for situations like these.

1839
01:01:00,400 --> 01:01:01,440
I see.

1840
01:01:01,440 --> 01:01:05,150
Our team is at a disadvantage
because of me.

1841
01:01:05,150 --> 01:01:07,750
- Let's try to use this.
- Right.

1842
01:01:07,750 --> 01:01:09,710
- It could be an advantage.
- Yes.

1843
01:01:09,710 --> 01:01:12,690
If you find a name tag,
and she can slap your back...

1844
01:01:12,690 --> 01:01:15,500
I'll run here and tell you.

1845
01:01:15,500 --> 01:01:17,560
If you're in trouble, yell.

1846
01:01:17,560 --> 01:01:19,020
(Like this?)

1847
01:01:19,230 --> 01:01:20,670
Do you have a strategy?

1848
01:01:20,670 --> 01:01:21,940
(Team Il Hwa is quiet.)

1849
01:01:21,940 --> 01:01:23,360
We're not like that.

1850
01:01:23,360 --> 01:01:25,860
Nothing works the way we plan.

1851
01:01:26,040 --> 01:01:27,440
We're awkward.

1852
01:01:27,440 --> 01:01:30,110
Look at our team. We're awkward.

1853
01:01:30,110 --> 01:01:31,310
Look at us.

1854
01:01:31,310 --> 01:01:33,440
We forget our strategy
after a few seconds.

1855
01:01:33,440 --> 01:01:34,750
- Really?
- We are just...

1856
01:01:34,750 --> 01:01:36,270
- We know.
- I really like our team.

1857
01:01:36,270 --> 01:01:37,750
You have to face life head on.

1858
01:01:37,750 --> 01:01:40,020
- We just have to move fast.
- Head on.

1859
01:01:40,020 --> 01:01:42,460
I really like our mom.

1860
01:01:42,460 --> 01:01:44,520
She's very kind.

1861
01:01:44,520 --> 01:01:47,250
She's really nice to me.

1862
01:01:47,250 --> 01:01:49,020
- She loves her first child.
- She does.

1863
01:01:49,020 --> 01:01:51,630
We had so much fun.

1864
01:01:51,630 --> 01:01:54,360
Let's start the race. Five...

1865
01:01:54,360 --> 01:01:57,170
(They have to find the name tags
and get slapped in the back.)

1866
01:01:57,170 --> 01:02:00,630
(The moms have to rip other mom's
name tags for an added benefit.)

1867
01:02:00,630 --> 01:02:01,670
Start.

1868
01:02:01,670 --> 01:02:03,040
(Race starts.)

1869
01:02:03,830 --> 01:02:06,000
- We have to find the name tags.
- Let's hurry.

1870
01:02:06,250 --> 01:02:07,880
Haha, look for them.

1871
01:02:08,110 --> 01:02:10,350
There must be one in the playground.

1872
01:02:10,350 --> 01:02:11,520
(Haha looks for name tags.)

1873
01:02:12,850 --> 01:02:13,850
Okay.

1874
01:02:13,850 --> 01:02:15,060
(Jong Kook protects
his mom closely.)

1875
01:02:15,060 --> 01:02:16,190
Over there.

1876
01:02:17,150 --> 01:02:19,150
Jong Kook is protecting her.

1877
01:02:19,150 --> 01:02:21,560
- Gosh.
- My gosh.

1878
01:02:21,560 --> 01:02:23,130
- It's okay. We're good here.
- We're okay.

1879
01:02:23,130 --> 01:02:25,920
The children are okay.
Moms have to be careful.

1880
01:02:26,290 --> 01:02:27,830
- Should we go for it?
- Really?

1881
01:02:27,830 --> 01:02:29,130
No, I'm okay.

1882
01:02:29,400 --> 01:02:30,460
Do you want to?

1883
01:02:30,460 --> 01:02:31,830
(Team Il Hwa approaches them.)

1884
01:02:31,830 --> 01:02:33,210
(Goodness)

1885
01:02:34,270 --> 01:02:36,730
Never mind.

1886
01:02:36,730 --> 01:02:38,380
(The handshake wakes him up.)

1887
01:02:38,380 --> 01:02:40,580
I was mistaken. Please keep going.

1888
01:02:40,580 --> 01:02:41,580
Please go ahead.

1889
01:02:41,580 --> 01:02:43,040
There's no reason to fight.

1890
01:02:43,040 --> 01:02:44,480
Let's...

1891
01:02:44,480 --> 01:02:46,610
- go this way.
- Let's keep going. We just started.

1892
01:02:48,060 --> 01:02:49,880
Is there a plastic bag?

1893
01:02:51,250 --> 01:02:52,920
(The other members are searching
for name tags.)

1894
01:02:52,920 --> 01:02:55,520
Would it be in a box?

1895
01:02:55,520 --> 01:02:56,650
Where is it?

1896
01:03:00,290 --> 01:03:03,330
(He finds Jong Kook's name tag.)

1897
01:03:03,600 --> 01:03:05,630
- No way. No way.
- Did you find a name tag?

1898
01:03:05,630 --> 01:03:06,900
- Did you find it?
- Jong Kook. Jong Kook's name tag.

1899
01:03:06,900 --> 01:03:08,040
Hold on!

1900
01:03:08,040 --> 01:03:09,670
(It's an opportunity
to give rice cakes to Jong Kook!)

1901
01:03:09,670 --> 01:03:11,110
- Jong Kook's name tag.
- Hold on!

1902
01:03:12,350 --> 01:03:14,270
There are no footsteps.

1903
01:03:14,810 --> 01:03:16,210
There is dust everywhere.

1904
01:03:16,310 --> 01:03:17,420
Mom!

1905
01:03:17,920 --> 01:03:19,110
Kwang Soo's mom!

1906
01:03:19,380 --> 01:03:20,580
Kwang Soo's mom!

1907
01:03:20,580 --> 01:03:22,380
Here! I am on my way.

1908
01:03:22,920 --> 01:03:25,080
Mom, hold on! Mom!

1909
01:03:25,560 --> 01:03:26,690
Hold on.

1910
01:03:26,690 --> 01:03:28,020
Let me cut another one.

1911
01:03:28,730 --> 01:03:29,860
Calm down!

1912
01:03:30,190 --> 01:03:31,560
- Hold on!
- Wait a second.

1913
01:03:31,560 --> 01:03:33,420
Let me cut another one.

1914
01:03:33,860 --> 01:03:35,060
Let me cut two rice cakes.

1915
01:03:35,960 --> 01:03:37,060
Go up there.

1916
01:03:37,630 --> 01:03:39,130
What is going on? Did you yell?

1917
01:03:39,210 --> 01:03:40,710
- We found a name tag!
- Where is it?

1918
01:03:40,710 --> 01:03:41,830
- Where is it?
- We found Jong Kook's name tag.

1919
01:03:41,940 --> 01:03:43,130
What is it?

1920
01:03:43,500 --> 01:03:46,000
It's Suk Jin.

1921
01:03:46,000 --> 01:03:47,480
(Slapping)

1922
01:03:48,020 --> 01:03:49,350
- One more.
- Whose name tag is it? Mine?

1923
01:03:49,480 --> 01:03:51,310
- No, no.
- Thank goodness.

1924
01:03:51,540 --> 01:03:53,850
(Thanks to Daniel,
Jong Kook got more rice cakes.)

1925
01:03:53,850 --> 01:03:55,310
Two and a half.

1926
01:03:56,690 --> 01:03:57,880
I cut up a lot.

1927
01:03:57,880 --> 01:03:58,980
(All of these are for Jong Kook.)

1928
01:03:59,250 --> 01:04:01,460
- You got more rice cakes.
- Me?

1929
01:04:01,750 --> 01:04:03,060
Did someone find
my name tag already?

1930
01:04:03,060 --> 01:04:04,400
(Did someone find
my name tag already?)

1931
01:04:04,600 --> 01:04:06,730
- Daniel, you found it. Good job.
- Yes.

1932
01:04:06,730 --> 01:04:08,460
Please find Kwang Soo's.

1933
01:04:08,460 --> 01:04:10,040
- We need to find name tags.
- Yes.

1934
01:04:11,040 --> 01:04:12,210
Se Chan.

1935
01:04:12,610 --> 01:04:13,730
Let's remove...

1936
01:04:13,730 --> 01:04:15,440
Young Hee's name tag.
She is all alone.

1937
01:04:15,440 --> 01:04:17,580
(Team Il Hwa spots Young Hee.)

1938
01:04:17,580 --> 01:04:20,480
(Only moms can remove
each other's name tag.)

1939
01:04:20,580 --> 01:04:22,610
- Remove her name tag.
- You should do it.

1940
01:04:22,650 --> 01:04:24,540
- Only you can do it.
- I said...

1941
01:04:24,580 --> 01:04:26,110
we shouldn't remove
each other's name tag.

1942
01:04:26,420 --> 01:04:28,060
You need to remove it.
That's how we win.

1943
01:04:28,060 --> 01:04:29,380
You need to remove it.

1944
01:04:29,810 --> 01:04:31,520
She is alone.

1945
01:04:31,520 --> 01:04:32,860
- There she is.
- You are right.

1946
01:04:33,750 --> 01:04:35,630
- It's hard to find the name tags.
- Let's pretend to look for them.

1947
01:04:35,960 --> 01:04:37,460
- You didn't find any, did you?
- You didn't find any, did you?

1948
01:04:37,830 --> 01:04:39,020
Did you find any name tags?

1949
01:04:39,270 --> 01:04:40,520
Why are you alone?

1950
01:04:41,060 --> 01:04:42,100
Seriously.

1951
01:04:42,100 --> 01:04:43,270
- Young Hee.
- Hold on.

1952
01:04:43,270 --> 01:04:44,330
(The two weak sons attack her.)

1953
01:04:44,330 --> 01:04:45,810
- Young Hee.
- Rip off her name tag.

1954
01:04:45,810 --> 01:04:47,040
Rip off her name tag. Hurry up.

1955
01:04:47,040 --> 01:04:48,330
- Hurry up.
- Kwang Soo!

1956
01:04:48,440 --> 01:04:50,440
- Hurry up.
- Don't slice the rice cakes!

1957
01:04:50,440 --> 01:04:52,940
- Don't slice the rice cakes!
- Hurry up.

1958
01:04:52,940 --> 01:04:54,350
- Kwang Soo!
- What?

1959
01:04:54,400 --> 01:04:55,540
Okay! Hold on!

1960
01:04:55,670 --> 01:04:57,670
Wait a minute! Wait a minute!

1961
01:04:58,150 --> 01:05:00,290
Wait a minute! Wait a minute!

1962
01:05:00,420 --> 01:05:02,460
- Hurry up.
- Don't slice the rice cakes!

1963
01:05:02,460 --> 01:05:05,330
- Don't slice the rice cakes!
- Hurry up.

1964
01:05:06,830 --> 01:05:08,230
(Young Hee's name tag
gets ripped off.)

1965
01:05:08,230 --> 01:05:10,060
- Don't slice the rice cakes!
- Hurry up.

1966
01:05:10,060 --> 01:05:12,020
(Despite screaming,
her name tag gets ripped off.)

1967
01:05:12,020 --> 01:05:13,460
Kwang Soo, stop!

1968
01:05:13,960 --> 01:05:15,270
Why would you walk around alone?

1969
01:05:16,940 --> 01:05:19,060
(Daniel heard his mom's cry.)

1970
01:05:19,060 --> 01:05:20,540
Kwang Soo, stop!

1971
01:05:20,540 --> 01:05:22,170
(Mom.)

1972
01:05:22,330 --> 01:05:24,110
Two name tags of each
of her family members will be added.

1973
01:05:24,110 --> 01:05:25,210
Two of each member.

1974
01:05:25,210 --> 01:05:26,940
- What should we do now?
- Okay.

1975
01:05:27,310 --> 01:05:29,480
I see that I shouldn't walk around
alone. I am sorry.

1976
01:05:29,480 --> 01:05:31,110
(Young Hee's children are
at a disadvantage.)

1977
01:05:31,110 --> 01:05:32,880
- Kwang Soo, stop!
- What? Stop?

1978
01:05:32,880 --> 01:05:34,080
- Stop, stop.
- What?

1979
01:05:34,150 --> 01:05:35,580
You should have said that first.

1980
01:05:35,580 --> 01:05:37,810
- I mean...
- You should have said that first.

1981
01:05:37,860 --> 01:05:40,290
- Whose name tag got ripped off?
- Our mom.

1982
01:05:40,920 --> 01:05:42,100
Our mom.

1983
01:05:42,100 --> 01:05:43,190
Our mom?

1984
01:05:43,190 --> 01:05:44,420
- Our mom?
- Yes.

1985
01:05:45,100 --> 01:05:46,190
It can't be helped.

1986
01:05:46,190 --> 01:05:47,360
This won't do.

1987
01:05:47,560 --> 01:05:48,960
I won't walk around alone.

1988
01:05:49,060 --> 01:05:51,290
I have a question. Sir.

1989
01:05:51,810 --> 01:05:53,500
I have a question.

1990
01:05:53,610 --> 01:05:55,500
Sir, is this a team competition?

1991
01:05:55,770 --> 01:05:58,210
Well, to moms,
the teams are important.

1992
01:05:58,500 --> 01:06:00,040
But you can play individually
if you want to avoid the penalty.

1993
01:06:00,610 --> 01:06:02,750
- Does that mean moms' rice cakes...
- Really?

1994
01:06:02,920 --> 01:06:04,580
- won't affect the children?
- I mean...

1995
01:06:05,540 --> 01:06:06,610
(So Min takes out...)

1996
01:06:06,610 --> 01:06:07,940
Hey! What are doing?

1997
01:06:08,650 --> 01:06:10,380
(Kwang Soo's name tag.)

1998
01:06:10,380 --> 01:06:11,860
- Really?
- Hey!

1999
01:06:12,020 --> 01:06:14,230
- What are doing?
- Really?

2000
01:06:14,230 --> 01:06:15,420
- Don't be like that.
- No, no.

2001
01:06:15,420 --> 01:06:16,900
- Let me think about this.
- Hey.

2002
01:06:17,100 --> 01:06:18,460
So Min, it has been a while.

2003
01:06:18,830 --> 01:06:20,690
- This is your true color.
- It's not like that.

2004
01:06:20,830 --> 01:06:21,940
Mom, look at her!

2005
01:06:21,940 --> 01:06:23,330
You need to put it
on your back first.

2006
01:06:23,330 --> 01:06:24,500
- Really?
- Yes.

2007
01:06:24,500 --> 01:06:26,610
Let me think about this.

2008
01:06:26,610 --> 01:06:28,110
Let me think about
when to put it on my back.

2009
01:06:28,110 --> 01:06:30,540
If she does that,
I will get back at her.

2010
01:06:30,830 --> 01:06:32,850
- Haha.
- What?

2011
01:06:32,850 --> 01:06:34,770
- I found one over there.
- Where?

2012
01:06:35,040 --> 01:06:36,580
- Whose is it?
- Suk Jin.

2013
01:06:36,580 --> 01:06:38,110
(Suk Jin is on Se Chan's team.)

2014
01:06:38,420 --> 01:06:39,520
So?

2015
01:06:39,750 --> 01:06:41,560
What are you...
Are you going to play individually?

2016
01:06:41,690 --> 01:06:42,750
That's what I always do.

2017
01:06:43,980 --> 01:06:45,830
- I can't rip off your name tag.
- What?

2018
01:06:45,830 --> 01:06:47,080
- I can't rip off your name tag.
- I can't rip off your name tag.

2019
01:06:47,080 --> 01:06:48,330
I know.

2020
01:06:50,420 --> 01:06:52,420
(Haha finds Suk Jin's name tag.)

2021
01:06:53,400 --> 01:06:54,520
Mom!

2022
01:06:55,000 --> 01:06:56,170
Mom!

2023
01:06:57,100 --> 01:06:58,500
(At that moment)

2024
01:06:58,500 --> 01:06:59,730
Mom, hurry up!

2025
01:07:00,940 --> 01:07:03,230
- Mom, hurry up!
- What is it?

2026
01:07:03,310 --> 01:07:04,480
Hurry up!

2027
01:07:04,480 --> 01:07:06,150
Jong Kook, please stop Suk Jin.

2028
01:07:06,310 --> 01:07:08,110
(At Haha's request)

2029
01:07:08,110 --> 01:07:09,250
- Did you put it on yourself?
- Yes.

2030
01:07:09,250 --> 01:07:10,750
Jong Kook, please stop Suk Jin.

2031
01:07:11,850 --> 01:07:14,190
(She slaps Suk Jin's name tag
right in front of him.)

2032
01:07:14,190 --> 01:07:15,480
- I gave you a back slap.
- All right.

2033
01:07:15,690 --> 01:07:17,310
I got Suk Jin.

2034
01:07:17,690 --> 01:07:19,560
What you sliced so far
will go to Suk Jin.

2035
01:07:19,560 --> 01:07:20,690
Suk Jin?

2036
01:07:21,250 --> 01:07:23,290
I see that it's best to slice
as much as I can.

2037
01:07:24,020 --> 01:07:25,400
(Suk Jin gets more rice cakes.)

2038
01:07:25,400 --> 01:07:26,960
Hey. Shall we...

2039
01:07:27,100 --> 01:07:28,790
Se Chan, shall we remove
her name tag again?

2040
01:07:29,540 --> 01:07:31,670
- Young Hee?
- Yes. Let's rip off her name tag.

2041
01:07:31,670 --> 01:07:33,360
Se Chan, let's do it one more time.

2042
01:07:34,110 --> 01:07:35,270
She went this way.

2043
01:07:36,130 --> 01:07:37,610
I need to find a name tag.

2044
01:07:37,610 --> 01:07:39,380
(Oh, my goodness.)

2045
01:07:40,110 --> 01:07:42,040
(They can catch Young Hee
whenever they want.)

2046
01:07:42,040 --> 01:07:43,110
Hang in there.

2047
01:07:43,440 --> 01:07:44,670
Go away! Go away!

2048
01:07:44,670 --> 01:07:45,710
Rip off her name tag.

2049
01:07:45,880 --> 01:07:47,690
- No! Mom!
- Come on.

2050
01:07:48,190 --> 01:07:49,880
- Mom!
- Okay.

2051
01:07:49,880 --> 01:07:52,580
- I am sorry.
- Young Hee, stop wandering alone.

2052
01:07:52,580 --> 01:07:54,080
- I am sorry.
- Protect Mom!

2053
01:07:55,130 --> 01:07:56,630
Where are Daniel and So Min?

2054
01:07:56,630 --> 01:07:57,900
(The two children wander
without knowing what happened.)

2055
01:07:58,270 --> 01:07:59,960
Look at that. Even close friends...

2056
01:07:59,960 --> 01:08:01,690
- turn on each other to win.
- Seriously.

2057
01:08:01,690 --> 01:08:03,770
You shouldn't walk around alone.

2058
01:08:04,360 --> 01:08:05,670
I will end you.

2059
01:08:06,400 --> 01:08:07,670
(2 name tags per member
of Team Young Hee get added.)

2060
01:08:07,670 --> 01:08:09,110
What should I do?

2061
01:08:09,730 --> 01:08:11,750
- There is no other way.
- You must find the name tags.

2062
01:08:11,850 --> 01:08:13,000
I must find the name tags.

2063
01:08:13,000 --> 01:08:15,020
But I am afraid they will rip off
my name tag again.

2064
01:08:15,580 --> 01:08:17,750
Shall we rip off Mi Sun's name tag?

2065
01:08:18,540 --> 01:08:20,690
- Will we be able to do that?
- Mi Sun...

2066
01:08:21,150 --> 01:08:22,960
Gosh, here they come.
They look strong.

2067
01:08:23,190 --> 01:08:25,080
- I'm actually sloppy.
- No, you aren't.

2068
01:08:25,480 --> 01:08:27,420
- Don't show it.
- Okay.

2069
01:08:27,420 --> 01:08:28,730
Don't show it.

2070
01:08:28,830 --> 01:08:30,400
Glare in a scary way.

2071
01:08:30,400 --> 01:08:31,920
It's okay. Make yourself look scary.

2072
01:08:31,920 --> 01:08:33,100
Let's go. Let's go.

2073
01:08:33,230 --> 01:08:34,940
We won't be able to do it
because of Jong Kook.

2074
01:08:35,960 --> 01:08:37,900
- We need to find the name tags.
- Hey, there is Young Hee.

2075
01:08:38,070 --> 01:08:40,070
- We need to find the name tags.
- There is Young Hee.

2076
01:08:40,240 --> 01:08:41,570
What? My mom?

2077
01:08:41,630 --> 01:08:42,830
We can beat So Min, right?

2078
01:08:42,830 --> 01:08:44,440
- Let's make a move.
- Let's make a move.

2079
01:08:44,440 --> 01:08:46,570
- Ji Hyo.
- Mom wants to make a move.

2080
01:08:46,650 --> 01:08:47,950
Mom, run away!

2081
01:08:48,040 --> 01:08:49,870
So Min, I...

2082
01:08:49,950 --> 01:08:51,480
- Mom!
- They are coming again.

2083
01:08:52,490 --> 01:08:53,780
- It's okay.
- Get her.

2084
01:08:53,780 --> 01:08:56,020
- Daniel isn't here.
- Hold on.

2085
01:08:56,950 --> 01:08:58,160
Protect her.

2086
01:08:58,380 --> 01:08:59,560
Help Mom rip off Mi Sun's name tag.

2087
01:09:00,190 --> 01:09:01,750
Oh, no!

2088
01:09:02,620 --> 01:09:04,620
Mom! Mom!

2089
01:09:04,620 --> 01:09:05,870
(Young Hee grabs
Mi Sun's name tag too.)

2090
01:09:05,870 --> 01:09:08,200
(It's Young Hee's chance
to retaliate!)

2091
01:09:08,200 --> 01:09:11,370
(The weakest mom
versus The sloppy mom)

2092
01:09:11,370 --> 01:09:13,910
(What will be the result?)

2093
01:09:14,910 --> 01:09:16,110
(Ripping)

2094
01:09:16,110 --> 01:09:18,700
(Young Hee gets her name tag
ripped off again.)

2095
01:09:21,000 --> 01:09:22,450
I feel bad for my mom.

2096
01:09:22,520 --> 01:09:24,520
- Our mom is the best.
- I feel bad for my mom.

2097
01:09:25,320 --> 01:09:26,520
Our mom is the best.

2098
01:09:26,580 --> 01:09:28,280
Did you see the way our mom
grabbed her by the collar?

2099
01:09:28,560 --> 01:09:29,780
I will find the name tags!

2100
01:09:29,780 --> 01:09:31,380
(Mom, I will find the name tags!)

2101
01:09:31,380 --> 01:09:32,920
Everyone is ripping off
her name tag.

2102
01:09:32,920 --> 01:09:35,250
Mom, I think
we can stop ripping off name tags.

2103
01:09:35,250 --> 01:09:36,900
- Let's stop.
- We got it on the camera.

2104
01:09:37,360 --> 01:09:39,420
- Are you okay?
- I am at the edge of the cliff.

2105
01:09:39,420 --> 01:09:40,920
I will end you all.

2106
01:09:40,920 --> 01:09:42,200
This is yours.

2107
01:09:42,630 --> 01:09:43,870
- We need to do it.
- Daniel.

2108
01:09:43,870 --> 01:09:45,440
(Daniel has been running
for a while.)

2109
01:09:46,030 --> 01:09:47,310
Mom!

2110
01:09:47,630 --> 01:09:49,740
(He has Haha's name tag
on his back.)

2111
01:09:50,830 --> 01:09:51,980
He found someone's name tag!

2112
01:09:52,500 --> 01:09:54,040
Kwang Soo!

2113
01:09:54,040 --> 01:09:55,170
Where is Mom?

2114
01:09:56,150 --> 01:09:57,370
Daniel, wait.

2115
01:09:57,870 --> 01:09:59,040
Give me some time!

2116
01:09:59,780 --> 01:10:01,490
- Mom!
- Daniel.

2117
01:10:01,490 --> 01:10:02,750
Let's wait.

2118
01:10:02,820 --> 01:10:04,250
Let's wait.

2119
01:10:04,380 --> 01:10:05,450
Let's wait.

2120
01:10:05,450 --> 01:10:06,860
(It's time for payback.)

2121
01:10:06,860 --> 01:10:08,250
(Mom, I did well, right?)

2122
01:10:08,450 --> 01:10:10,490
- Kwang Soo, slice many rice cakes.
- Hold on.

2123
01:10:10,990 --> 01:10:13,620
Mom, let me slice two more.

2124
01:10:13,620 --> 01:10:14,700
- 2?
- He will slice 2 more.

2125
01:10:14,700 --> 01:10:17,130
- Slice two at a time.
- Okay.

2126
01:10:17,130 --> 01:10:19,440
- Let me slice two more.
- Hold on.

2127
01:10:19,610 --> 01:10:21,000
Those will go to Daniel.

2128
01:10:23,500 --> 01:10:24,610
What?

2129
01:10:24,940 --> 01:10:26,150
No way.

2130
01:10:26,240 --> 01:10:27,910
Daniel is out.

2131
01:10:27,910 --> 01:10:29,170
- Those will go to Daniel.
- What?

2132
01:10:29,370 --> 01:10:30,480
Daniel, I am sorry.

2133
01:10:30,480 --> 01:10:31,650
(I am out?)

2134
01:10:31,740 --> 01:10:32,780
Daniel, I am sorry.

2135
01:10:34,450 --> 01:10:35,990
Why is there so much in my tray?

2136
01:10:36,120 --> 01:10:39,060
We can add more rice cakes
to Haha's tray.

2137
01:10:39,060 --> 01:10:40,660
- Why is there so much in my tray?
- That's right.

2138
01:10:40,660 --> 01:10:42,420
That's right. Keep slicing.

2139
01:10:43,060 --> 01:10:45,920
- I will slice four rice cakes.
- Okay, okay.

2140
01:10:46,460 --> 01:10:47,990
It's the most I have sliced at once.

2141
01:10:48,630 --> 01:10:49,790
Watch your fingers.

2142
01:10:49,790 --> 01:10:50,940
(She worries like a mom.)

2143
01:10:51,070 --> 01:10:53,910
How is it going?

2144
01:10:53,910 --> 01:10:55,480
I sliced four rice cakes.
It's the most I have sliced at once.

2145
01:10:55,480 --> 01:10:57,030
- Kwang Soo, how is it going?
- Hold on.

2146
01:10:57,030 --> 01:10:58,070
I can't find any name tags.

2147
01:10:58,070 --> 01:11:00,150
- So Min is out.
- What? Me?

2148
01:11:00,480 --> 01:11:01,570
Why am I out?

2149
01:11:01,670 --> 01:11:02,980
- What?
- So Min, I am sorry.

2150
01:11:03,170 --> 01:11:04,870
- What are you doing?
- You got four rice cakes.

2151
01:11:04,980 --> 01:11:07,740
- Why?
- Daniel found Haha's name tag.

2152
01:11:07,740 --> 01:11:10,060
- Why...
- Slice more rice cakes.

2153
01:11:10,060 --> 01:11:12,420
Then you should have given them
to Haha, not me.

2154
01:11:12,420 --> 01:11:14,120
I wanted to do that
after slicing four rice cakes.

2155
01:11:14,120 --> 01:11:15,450
I can't find any name tags.

2156
01:11:15,450 --> 01:11:17,200
So Min has the most.
She came out on top.

2157
01:11:17,200 --> 01:11:18,290
Stop it.

2158
01:11:18,400 --> 01:11:20,320
- Stop slicing rice cakes!
- It's not like that.

2159
01:11:20,490 --> 01:11:21,990
Daniel found Haha's name tag.

2160
01:11:23,030 --> 01:11:24,200
I will slice three rice cakes
this time.

2161
01:11:24,200 --> 01:11:25,660
(He can't stop slicing rice cakes.)

2162
01:11:26,330 --> 01:11:28,530
(Jae Suk is looking for name tags.)

2163
01:11:30,410 --> 01:11:34,310
(What? He finds
Kwang Soo's name tag.)

2164
01:11:34,410 --> 01:11:35,740
I will see
how things are going first.

2165
01:11:36,650 --> 01:11:39,990
(With the name tag on his back,
he approaches Kwang Soo.)

2166
01:11:39,990 --> 01:11:41,240
- Did you slice a lot?
- Yes.

2167
01:11:41,410 --> 01:11:43,120
- How many did you slice?
- I sliced two so far.

2168
01:11:43,120 --> 01:11:45,320
I can slice five rice cakes.

2169
01:11:45,420 --> 01:11:47,750
Since there isn't much time left,

2170
01:11:48,190 --> 01:11:50,160
- slice as many as you can.
- Seriously.

2171
01:11:50,160 --> 01:11:51,530
I don't know who will get them,

2172
01:11:51,600 --> 01:11:53,960
- but you should slice a lot.
- These rice cakes are soft.

2173
01:11:54,160 --> 01:11:56,240
You are slicing 3 at a time.
You should slice 4 at a time.

2174
01:11:56,330 --> 01:11:58,070
- There are...
- Come on.

2175
01:11:58,130 --> 01:11:59,500
too many name tags of ours.

2176
01:12:01,310 --> 01:12:03,030
- You worry me.
- Did they get you again?

2177
01:12:03,240 --> 01:12:06,070
Yes, it happened 2 times.
I can't even win against 1 person.

2178
01:12:06,070 --> 01:12:08,570
- So I don't know what to do.
- You know,

2179
01:12:09,410 --> 01:12:11,410
all the moms are looking for you.

2180
01:12:11,410 --> 01:12:13,320
I am like an impala.

2181
01:12:13,320 --> 01:12:15,560
- Young Hee, how are you...
- A herbivore.

2182
01:12:15,690 --> 01:12:17,860
Kwang Soo, you shouldn't slice
so many rice cakes.

2183
01:12:17,860 --> 01:12:19,730
- The unfortunate one will get them.
- The unfortunate one will get them.

2184
01:12:19,730 --> 01:12:21,860
I sliced five rice cakes so far.

2185
01:12:21,860 --> 01:12:23,950
Whoever gets them will be over.

2186
01:12:23,950 --> 01:12:25,100
It's bound to happen.

2187
01:12:25,100 --> 01:12:27,160
- Whoever gets them will be over.
- Whoever gets them will be over.

2188
01:12:27,160 --> 01:12:29,270
Kwang Soo, there are
many of our name tags.

2189
01:12:30,270 --> 01:12:31,400
Anyway,

2190
01:12:31,830 --> 01:12:33,070
- keep slicing.
- In that case...

2191
01:12:33,160 --> 01:12:35,130
- We play individually anyway.
- You are right.

2192
01:12:35,330 --> 01:12:37,500
Hold on. He has
Kwang Soo's name tag on his back.

2193
01:12:37,500 --> 01:12:38,610
Let's go.

2194
01:12:38,850 --> 01:12:41,450
(Why is my son's name tag
on his back?)

2195
01:12:42,570 --> 01:12:44,450
(He gets a back slap
right after the discovery.)

2196
01:12:44,450 --> 01:12:45,650
- Kwang Soo.
- Oh, it's Kwang Soo?

2197
01:12:46,190 --> 01:12:47,320
- Hold on.
- Hold on.

2198
01:12:47,620 --> 01:12:50,060
- Someone got all these rice cakes.
- Seriously. This is insane.

2199
01:12:50,620 --> 01:12:51,860
Put them in Kwang Soo's tray.

2200
01:12:52,660 --> 01:12:54,560
No way!

2201
01:12:55,230 --> 01:12:56,530
Put them in Kwang Soo's tray.

2202
01:12:57,290 --> 01:12:59,270
No way!

2203
01:12:59,700 --> 01:13:01,830
Why did you slice
so many rice cakes?

2204
01:13:01,830 --> 01:13:03,240
You told me to do that!

2205
01:13:03,940 --> 01:13:05,500
- I didn't know it was you.
- Kwang Soo,

2206
01:13:05,500 --> 01:13:09,870
he has your name tag on his back.

2207
01:13:10,170 --> 01:13:12,000
That's why he told you to cut more.

2208
01:13:12,000 --> 01:13:14,070
These evil people.

2209
01:13:14,480 --> 01:13:15,480
I'm so mad.

2210
01:13:15,480 --> 01:13:18,120
This is too big.
This shouldn't count.

2211
01:13:18,280 --> 01:13:21,190
(He looks satisfied.)

2212
01:13:22,990 --> 01:13:25,880
- People are evil here.
- I think this is too much.

2213
01:13:25,880 --> 01:13:27,190
I didn't know.

2214
01:13:27,280 --> 01:13:30,420
If I knew,
I wouldn't have been so good.

2215
01:13:30,420 --> 01:13:31,620
Isn't it fun though?

2216
01:13:32,160 --> 01:13:34,160
I don't know why, but this is fun.

2217
01:13:34,160 --> 01:13:35,400
(She's simple.)

2218
01:13:35,570 --> 01:13:36,790
What did you say before?

2219
01:13:36,790 --> 01:13:38,770
Yours and mine are similar.

2220
01:13:39,870 --> 01:13:41,200
I should stop cutting.

2221
01:13:42,280 --> 01:13:44,440
(While Team Young Hee is
falling apart)

2222
01:13:44,440 --> 01:13:45,910
- Did you find more?
- No.

2223
01:13:46,000 --> 01:13:48,070
- No.
- You didn't, right?

2224
01:13:49,620 --> 01:13:51,350
- Daniel, did you find one?
- No, I didn't.

2225
01:13:52,380 --> 01:13:54,040
(He was stalling.)

2226
01:13:54,950 --> 01:13:56,750
(He finds a name tag on the wall.)

2227
01:13:58,280 --> 01:13:59,950
(Yes)

2228
01:14:00,160 --> 01:14:03,400
(It's Jae Suk's name tag.)

2229
01:14:04,560 --> 01:14:05,660
(They're startled.)

2230
01:14:05,990 --> 01:14:07,400
It's Jae Suk's.

2231
01:14:07,400 --> 01:14:10,400
(They're on the same team,
but it's not his.)

2232
01:14:11,030 --> 01:14:12,500
Cut, Kwang Soo!

2233
01:14:12,660 --> 01:14:13,830
- Do I cut?
- Keep cutting.

2234
01:14:13,830 --> 01:14:16,330
- Do I cut? Take your time.
- Cut some more.

2235
01:14:16,530 --> 01:14:18,070
- This too.
- Cut a lot.

2236
01:14:18,070 --> 01:14:19,870
Mom, this too.

2237
01:14:19,870 --> 01:14:21,500
- Cut some more.
- Who is it?

2238
01:14:21,500 --> 01:14:23,070
- Jae Suk.
- Wait.

2239
01:14:23,620 --> 01:14:24,780
- Jae Suk.
- Earlier.

2240
01:14:24,780 --> 01:14:27,020
(I don't know anymore.)

2241
01:14:27,490 --> 01:14:30,690
(Jae Suk made him mad.)

2242
01:14:30,780 --> 01:14:32,380
- Are you sure it's him?
- Yes.

2243
01:14:32,380 --> 01:14:35,030
But they can't find ours.

2244
01:14:35,250 --> 01:14:36,620
Use a knife.

2245
01:14:38,060 --> 01:14:40,570
(His insanity explodes.)

2246
01:14:40,570 --> 01:14:42,660
Goodness. Use a knife.

2247
01:14:43,270 --> 01:14:44,960
This too. I have five lines.

2248
01:14:44,960 --> 01:14:46,870
- That's not the problem.
- Six lines with this.

2249
01:14:46,870 --> 01:14:47,870
(He cut for revenge.)

2250
01:14:47,870 --> 01:14:48,870
Wait.

2251
01:14:49,000 --> 01:14:50,170
Now!

2252
01:14:50,170 --> 01:14:52,110
(He signals.)

2253
01:14:52,110 --> 01:14:53,370
- There you go.
- Now!

2254
01:14:53,370 --> 01:14:54,870
- We got it.
- I ripped it.

2255
01:14:54,870 --> 01:14:56,150
It's Jae Suk.

2256
01:14:56,150 --> 01:14:58,370
I'm sorry
for being an incompetent mom.

2257
01:14:58,370 --> 01:15:00,150
No, don't say that. Please.

2258
01:15:00,150 --> 01:15:01,580
Where's my stamp?

2259
01:15:01,580 --> 01:15:03,410
(He finally took revenge
for his mom.)

2260
01:15:03,410 --> 01:15:04,750
Should I cut or not?

2261
01:15:04,750 --> 01:15:06,250
- Keep cutting.
- Do I stop?

2262
01:15:06,250 --> 01:15:08,060
Why do I have so many?

2263
01:15:08,190 --> 01:15:09,320
It was Daniel.

2264
01:15:09,320 --> 01:15:11,160
You'll get the penalty soon.

2265
01:15:11,160 --> 01:15:12,570
- Why do I have so many?
- All right.

2266
01:15:12,570 --> 01:15:13,990
Why do I have so many?

2267
01:15:13,990 --> 01:15:16,290
What's all this?
What's wrong with mine?

2268
01:15:16,290 --> 01:15:19,460
Kwang Soo, you don't want to be
in last place, right?

2269
01:15:19,530 --> 01:15:20,740
Look at my back.

2270
01:15:20,940 --> 01:15:23,030
(So Min's name tag?)

2271
01:15:23,030 --> 01:15:25,130
- You have to cut a lot.
- No, don't.

2272
01:15:25,130 --> 01:15:27,150
- It's So Min's.
- Mom.

2273
01:15:27,150 --> 01:15:28,200
(I'm sorry, Mom.)

2274
01:15:28,200 --> 01:15:29,570
(To be honest,)

2275
01:15:29,570 --> 01:15:31,710
(people found all my name tags,)

2276
01:15:31,710 --> 01:15:35,380
(so I'll probably get last place.)

2277
01:15:36,360 --> 01:15:37,860
You're playing by yourself, right?

2278
01:15:37,990 --> 01:15:39,450
- Mom.
- What's going on?

2279
01:15:39,450 --> 01:15:41,530
Hit her name tag.

2280
01:15:41,530 --> 01:15:42,620
Kwang Soo,

2281
01:15:42,790 --> 01:15:45,570
- we have the most.
- You're in last place.

2282
01:15:45,570 --> 01:15:47,820
I don't want you to get last place.
Keep cutting.

2283
01:15:47,820 --> 01:15:48,900
- Aren't you going to cut more?
- There's so much.

2284
01:15:49,030 --> 01:15:50,490
- Stop cutting.
- No, Kwang Soo.

2285
01:15:50,490 --> 01:15:51,830
- Keep cutting.
- Don't.

2286
01:15:51,830 --> 01:15:53,440
- I don't think that's right.
- That's for So Min.

2287
01:15:53,440 --> 01:15:54,700
- Stop cutting.
- Look.

2288
01:15:54,810 --> 01:15:56,630
I don't care about So Min.

2289
01:15:56,630 --> 01:15:57,700
(He made up his mind.)

2290
01:15:58,070 --> 01:15:59,870
I have so much.

2291
01:15:59,870 --> 01:16:01,670
- Cut a lot.
- The last place gets the penalty.

2292
01:16:01,670 --> 01:16:04,020
- Only the last place does.
- Is that what I taught you?

2293
01:16:04,620 --> 01:16:05,740
I can't find more.

2294
01:16:05,740 --> 01:16:06,990
(She doesn't have a clue.)

2295
01:16:06,990 --> 01:16:10,080
- Suk Jin! That's So Min's team.
- Come this way.

2296
01:16:10,080 --> 01:16:11,560
Fine, I'm coming.

2297
01:16:11,560 --> 01:16:13,190
- My mom can hit you.
- While I walk over there...

2298
01:16:13,320 --> 01:16:14,750
Hold on, Suk Jin!

2299
01:16:14,750 --> 01:16:15,990
- Hurry up.
- Up to this.

2300
01:16:15,990 --> 01:16:17,250
Up to this.

2301
01:16:17,250 --> 01:16:19,270
- How long?
- I'm almost there!

2302
01:16:19,270 --> 01:16:21,320
- He wants you to wait.
- Two more.

2303
01:16:21,600 --> 01:16:22,790
Two more.

2304
01:16:22,790 --> 01:16:24,960
- What's going on?
- Two more!

2305
01:16:25,130 --> 01:16:26,630
- Who is it?
- So Min, it's yours.

2306
01:16:26,630 --> 01:16:27,810
- So Min!
- No!

2307
01:16:27,810 --> 01:16:29,000
- Whose name is it?
- So Min, it's yours.

2308
01:16:29,000 --> 01:16:30,170
(No!)

2309
01:16:30,170 --> 01:16:31,410
Stop him.

2310
01:16:31,410 --> 01:16:33,480
Run away!

2311
01:16:33,700 --> 01:16:36,020
(He's about to be slapped.)

2312
01:16:36,020 --> 01:16:38,370
- Stop him.
- Run away!

2313
01:16:38,370 --> 01:16:39,380
(Please don't slap my name tag.)

2314
01:16:39,380 --> 01:16:40,910
- Run away!
- Hurry up.

2315
01:16:40,910 --> 01:16:42,160
Run away!

2316
01:16:42,780 --> 01:16:43,910
Run away!

2317
01:16:43,910 --> 01:16:45,360
- Hurry up.
- What?

2318
01:16:45,360 --> 01:16:46,620
- Run away!
- What's going on?

2319
01:16:46,620 --> 01:16:47,860
- Run away!
- Hurry up.

2320
01:16:47,860 --> 01:16:49,230
- What are you doing?
- Hurry up.

2321
01:16:49,320 --> 01:16:50,700
- Hurry.
- No.

2322
01:16:50,790 --> 01:16:52,070
Now!

2323
01:16:52,070 --> 01:16:53,790
- Now!
- Slap him.

2324
01:16:53,790 --> 01:16:55,460
- Slap him!
- This is ridiculous.

2325
01:16:55,460 --> 01:16:59,130
- Slap him!
- She slapped him.

2326
01:16:59,130 --> 01:17:00,660
(She slapped his back.)

2327
01:17:00,660 --> 01:17:02,240
(Jeon So Min)

2328
01:17:02,530 --> 01:17:04,570
What? This is so unfair.

2329
01:17:04,570 --> 01:17:06,110
- So Min.
- What was that for?

2330
01:17:06,110 --> 01:17:07,910
- This is not how you play!
- So Min.

2331
01:17:08,000 --> 01:17:10,070
- Hey! You!
- She got six more.

2332
01:17:10,410 --> 01:17:12,380
So Min.

2333
01:17:12,380 --> 01:17:14,240
This is not how you play.

2334
01:17:14,240 --> 01:17:15,280
You evil person.

2335
01:17:15,280 --> 01:17:16,860
(Kwang Soo kills his team,
and the race is over.)

2336
01:17:16,860 --> 01:17:18,160
Hey.

2337
01:17:18,210 --> 01:17:20,920
- I was happy you had so much fun.
- Kwang Soo.

2338
01:17:20,920 --> 01:17:22,030
You should write in your diary.

2339
01:17:22,030 --> 01:17:23,060
(It's been 3 weeks,
so they're more generous.)

2340
01:17:23,060 --> 01:17:25,790
It's nice for him to come outside
after a long time.

2341
01:17:25,790 --> 01:17:27,490
I was just cutting rice cakes,
and I had so much fun.

2342
01:17:27,820 --> 01:17:30,660
It feels like
we volunteered for him.

2343
01:17:31,290 --> 01:17:32,960
- I had so much fun today.
- Exactly.

2344
01:17:32,960 --> 01:17:35,610
Another Rice Cake to
the Ugly Child race.

2345
01:17:35,670 --> 01:17:37,070
The winning team is...

2346
01:17:37,070 --> 01:17:41,040
(Today's winning team is...)

2347
01:17:41,040 --> 01:17:43,740
Team Mi Sun with 4.967kg.

2348
01:17:43,740 --> 01:17:44,870
(1st place is Team Mi Sun.)

2349
01:17:45,210 --> 01:17:46,320
(Honey, I'm bringing a prize home.)

2350
01:17:46,320 --> 01:17:47,710
- Our mom worked so hard.
- My mom is the best.

2351
01:17:47,710 --> 01:17:49,750
- She worked so hard.
- She's the best.

2352
01:17:49,750 --> 01:17:51,380
So Min has so many.

2353
01:17:51,380 --> 01:17:53,730
We all have less than her.

2354
01:17:54,160 --> 01:17:56,250
Kwang Soo thought
this was one-on-one.

2355
01:17:57,290 --> 01:17:58,320
Daniel.

2356
01:17:58,320 --> 01:17:59,960
(The person with the heaviest bag
gets the penalty.)

2357
01:17:59,960 --> 01:18:01,160
He has a lot too.

2358
01:18:01,160 --> 01:18:04,070
I kept on waiting.

2359
01:18:04,070 --> 01:18:05,290
2.680.

2360
01:18:06,770 --> 01:18:08,240
0.386.

2361
01:18:08,240 --> 01:18:10,000
0.398kg.

2362
01:18:10,000 --> 01:18:11,200
1.508.

2363
01:18:11,200 --> 01:18:13,480
Take some rice cakes home.

2364
01:18:13,480 --> 01:18:15,910
- It's between So Min and Kwang Soo.
- They're the last two.

2365
01:18:15,910 --> 01:18:17,710
It's wide. Look.

2366
01:18:17,710 --> 01:18:18,820
You can't tell.

2367
01:18:18,820 --> 01:18:19,990
So Min's is taller.

2368
01:18:20,320 --> 01:18:22,360
This is going to be a tight race.

2369
01:18:22,360 --> 01:18:25,190
- Kwang Soo has more on the bottom.
- Kwang Soo.

2370
01:18:25,450 --> 01:18:27,160
- They weren't cut.
- Long ones.

2371
01:18:27,880 --> 01:18:28,920
Kwang Soo.

2372
01:18:28,920 --> 01:18:30,120
What?

2373
01:18:30,250 --> 01:18:31,320
- What is it?
- What is it?

2374
01:18:31,320 --> 01:18:33,070
- 4.856.
- 856.

2375
01:18:33,370 --> 01:18:36,290
4.856.

2376
01:18:36,290 --> 01:18:37,600
- 4.856.
- So Min.

2377
01:18:38,200 --> 01:18:39,240
So Min.

2378
01:18:39,240 --> 01:18:41,310
(How heavy is her bag?)

2379
01:18:41,310 --> 01:18:42,810
- It's over 4kg.
- Hold on.

2380
01:18:42,810 --> 01:18:44,810
- Wait.
- Hold on.

2381
01:18:44,810 --> 01:18:46,170
- You have to be careful.
- Wait!

2382
01:18:46,170 --> 01:18:48,280
- Wait.
- The tie too.

2383
01:18:48,280 --> 01:18:50,850
- It was So Min at the end.
- Weigh the tie too.

2384
01:18:50,850 --> 01:18:52,490
- Weigh that too.
- Be accurate.

2385
01:18:52,490 --> 01:18:54,520
Put it in the middle. Good.

2386
01:18:54,710 --> 01:18:55,950
Again.

2387
01:18:55,950 --> 01:18:57,380
Please weigh it again.

2388
01:18:57,380 --> 01:18:58,450
Fine.

2389
01:18:59,120 --> 01:19:00,120
There you go.

2390
01:19:00,120 --> 01:19:03,660
- 4.908.
- Again.

2391
01:19:03,660 --> 01:19:05,230
- Weigh Kwang Soo's.
- We'll try one last time.

2392
01:19:05,230 --> 01:19:06,820
It's 52g difference right now.

2393
01:19:06,820 --> 01:19:08,600
- 4.908.
- Again.

2394
01:19:08,600 --> 01:19:09,700
She's getting the penalty.

2395
01:19:09,700 --> 01:19:10,740
(The difference is really small,
so they weigh Kwang Soo's again.)

2396
01:19:11,200 --> 01:19:12,830
I should have cut two more!

2397
01:19:12,830 --> 01:19:14,960
You just got back,
and you might get a penalty.

2398
01:19:14,960 --> 01:19:16,280
- That's incredible.
- No.

2399
01:19:16,280 --> 01:19:17,570
- We don't know yet.
- Are there more rice cakes?

2400
01:19:17,570 --> 01:19:19,150
Are there any on the ground?

2401
01:19:20,410 --> 01:19:21,740
I'll place it on the scale.

2402
01:19:21,740 --> 01:19:24,350
(Will Kwang Soo receive a penalty
on his first day back?)

2403
01:19:24,350 --> 01:19:25,520
The tie too.

2404
01:19:25,520 --> 01:19:26,950
(Or will it be So Min?)

2405
01:19:28,040 --> 01:19:31,560
(On the second time,
his bag weighs...)

2406
01:19:31,560 --> 01:19:33,080
- 4.854.
- 854.

2407
01:19:33,080 --> 01:19:34,080
Okay!

2408
01:19:34,080 --> 01:19:35,860
(His bag is 4.854kg.)

2409
01:19:35,860 --> 01:19:37,120
(He's still 54g less than So Min.)

2410
01:19:37,120 --> 01:19:38,320
What's the difference?

2411
01:19:38,320 --> 01:19:39,600
With a 54g difference,

2412
01:19:39,600 --> 01:19:41,290
So Min comes in last place today.

2413
01:19:41,290 --> 01:19:42,530
No way.

2414
01:19:42,530 --> 01:19:44,130
(The last moment
changed everything.)

2415
01:19:44,130 --> 01:19:45,370
Did you have fun, Kwang Soo?

2416
01:19:45,660 --> 01:19:46,960
This must be paradise.

2417
01:19:47,740 --> 01:19:49,670
This is what I live for.

2418
01:19:49,670 --> 01:19:51,630
He's happy.

2419
01:19:51,630 --> 01:19:53,070
Please bring the prizes.

2420
01:19:53,070 --> 01:19:54,070
(It's time to pick the prizes.)

2421
01:19:54,070 --> 01:19:56,020
This is so good.

2422
01:19:56,350 --> 01:19:58,320
The prizes are really good.

2423
01:19:58,950 --> 01:20:00,950
- There are many good ones.
- There's a good variety.

2424
01:20:00,950 --> 01:20:03,360
- Korean pork.
- Korean beef set.

2425
01:20:03,360 --> 01:20:05,690
- I want this.
- There's Korean pork.

2426
01:20:05,690 --> 01:20:07,990
You might get something
like this too.

2427
01:20:08,250 --> 01:20:09,530
- Face cushion.
- Who is that?

2428
01:20:09,530 --> 01:20:11,400
You can do this
if you don't want to see the face.

2429
01:20:11,400 --> 01:20:12,530
(Suk Jin's face cushion.
You can hide his face.)

2430
01:20:12,530 --> 01:20:14,730
This one's useless.

2431
01:20:14,730 --> 01:20:15,990
How are you supposed to
get rid of it?

2432
01:20:15,990 --> 01:20:17,070
That's the worst.

2433
01:20:17,070 --> 01:20:18,130
- It's nice to have one.
- It's the worst.

2434
01:20:18,130 --> 01:20:19,500
It doesn't even fit in trash bags.

2435
01:20:19,500 --> 01:20:22,370
Mi Sun, you're the captain and mom
of the winning team.

2436
01:20:22,370 --> 01:20:24,240
Let's do the lucky prize draw.

2437
01:20:24,670 --> 01:20:26,350
I want to try this.

2438
01:20:26,350 --> 01:20:28,610
Place your favorite items on
your favorite numbers.

2439
01:20:28,610 --> 01:20:30,780
I'm doing it randomly.

2440
01:20:30,780 --> 01:20:32,280
- This is fun.
- Right?

2441
01:20:32,280 --> 01:20:34,080
- It makes you nervous.
- That's what makes it fun.

2442
01:20:34,280 --> 01:20:36,490
Please pick a number.

2443
01:20:37,020 --> 01:20:38,360
All right.

2444
01:20:38,560 --> 01:20:40,360
Let's see.

2445
01:20:40,730 --> 01:20:42,320
Let's go for the massage chair.

2446
01:20:42,320 --> 01:20:43,990
Pick number 28!

2447
01:20:44,120 --> 01:20:45,600
Number 28.

2448
01:20:45,600 --> 01:20:46,660
(She picked one!)

2449
01:20:46,990 --> 01:20:49,570
- 1, 2, 3.
- Look at it.

2450
01:20:49,700 --> 01:20:50,900
(She throws it.)

2451
01:20:50,900 --> 01:20:52,700
Why did you throw it?

2452
01:20:52,700 --> 01:20:54,440
- 30...
- 33.

2453
01:20:54,440 --> 01:20:55,440
(She picked number 33.)

2454
01:20:56,030 --> 01:20:57,630
(What's on 33?)

2455
01:20:57,630 --> 01:20:59,240
Oh, dear. This is 33.

2456
01:20:59,540 --> 01:21:02,240
It's a dud. Oh, dear.

2457
01:21:02,240 --> 01:21:03,240
(She's sad.)

2458
01:21:03,240 --> 01:21:04,350
She dropped it.

2459
01:21:04,350 --> 01:21:06,080
That was a dud!

2460
01:21:06,740 --> 01:21:08,520
- It's okay.
- He's cold-hearted.

2461
01:21:08,520 --> 01:21:09,690
He is.

2462
01:21:09,690 --> 01:21:12,360
Lastly, So Min.

2463
01:21:12,360 --> 01:21:14,060
You have to receive the penalty.

2464
01:21:14,060 --> 01:21:16,600
It's a simple penalty.

2465
01:21:16,600 --> 01:21:18,620
The other two moms will
spray water on her...

2466
01:21:18,620 --> 01:21:20,120
so that
she can pull herself together.

2467
01:21:20,270 --> 01:21:21,920
That's great.

2468
01:21:21,920 --> 01:21:23,130
That's nothing.

2469
01:21:23,130 --> 01:21:24,130
- What?
- Should we do that?

2470
01:21:24,130 --> 01:21:25,160
That's nothing.

2471
01:21:25,160 --> 01:21:26,960
It's okay. I got a prize last week.

2472
01:21:26,960 --> 01:21:28,810
- This is not a bad penalty.
- It's not.

2473
01:21:28,810 --> 01:21:30,610
They are the moms.

2474
01:21:30,610 --> 01:21:32,170
- What are you doing?
- Nothing.

2475
01:21:32,170 --> 01:21:33,540
Should I pour some more?

2476
01:21:33,540 --> 01:21:34,740
(Kwang Soo,
should I pour some more?)

2477
01:21:35,170 --> 01:21:36,280
What do you think?

2478
01:21:36,280 --> 01:21:38,070
- You need to pour some more.
- This is nothing.

2479
01:21:38,210 --> 01:21:40,380
Kwang Soo is asking him
to pour some more.

2480
01:21:40,690 --> 01:21:42,190
"Se Chan, pour some more."

2481
01:21:42,190 --> 01:21:43,750
This family is a mess.

2482
01:21:43,750 --> 01:21:44,990
I know.

2483
01:21:44,990 --> 01:21:46,250
(Take this!)

2484
01:21:47,420 --> 01:21:49,320
(Kwang Soo is finally back.)

2485
01:21:49,320 --> 01:21:50,750
I thought
we would let it go for once.

2486
01:21:50,750 --> 01:21:53,100
Do you feel better now?

2487
01:21:53,100 --> 01:21:54,100
So Min.

2488
01:21:54,100 --> 01:21:56,070
This finally feels like Running Man.

2489
01:21:56,070 --> 01:21:57,900
- You feel better.
- I do.

2490
01:21:58,160 --> 01:22:00,810
I feel really bad.
I haven't done this before.

2491
01:22:00,810 --> 01:22:02,030
Please do it.

2492
01:22:02,030 --> 01:22:04,130
- She's going to run at her.
- This is nothing.

2493
01:22:04,130 --> 01:22:07,310
Pull yourself together
and listen to your parents.

2494
01:22:07,310 --> 01:22:09,170
You're too far away.

2495
01:22:10,910 --> 01:22:13,350
(Splashing)

2496
01:22:15,190 --> 01:22:17,490
(She misses on purpose.)

2497
01:22:18,380 --> 01:22:21,380
(She aimed for his face.)

2498
01:22:21,660 --> 01:22:23,400
- That was a mistake.
- I'm sorry.

2499
01:22:23,700 --> 01:22:26,420
- That was a mistake. Sorry!
- That was a mistake.

2500
01:22:26,420 --> 01:22:27,990
- Well...
- Oh, dear.

2501
01:22:27,990 --> 01:22:29,770
- So Min...
- She can't aim.

2502
01:22:29,770 --> 01:22:30,770
So Min got...

2503
01:22:30,770 --> 01:22:31,960
- 5 something.
- That was bad.

2504
01:22:31,960 --> 01:22:33,700
I meant to do this, but did that.

2505
01:22:33,700 --> 01:22:35,030
- It was a mistake.
- It truly was.

2506
01:22:35,030 --> 01:22:36,870
That's understandable.

2507
01:22:36,870 --> 01:22:38,310
(It feels like Kwang Soo got
last place for some reason.)

2508
01:22:44,450 --> 01:22:46,910
(Kwang Soo's Idols are
getting ready to debut.)

2509
01:22:47,280 --> 01:22:48,410
(However,)

2510
01:22:48,410 --> 01:22:50,750
(is Running Man watching them?)

2511
01:22:51,620 --> 01:22:53,780
(Is there a traitor?)

2512
01:22:53,780 --> 01:22:56,230
(The idols fall into trouble
right before their debut.)

2513
01:22:56,990 --> 01:22:59,660
(Their greed to
obtain the name tags)

2514
01:23:00,270 --> 01:23:02,030
(The teamwork starts to
fall apart...)

2515
01:23:02,030 --> 01:23:03,870
(in the hidden secret room.)

2516
01:23:04,270 --> 01:23:07,000
(The only weapon to destroy
the weak idol team)

2517
01:23:07,410 --> 01:23:10,000
(The deal with evil for name tags)

2518
01:23:10,000 --> 01:23:12,610
(They should never let their
guards down even when lying down.)

2519
01:23:12,950 --> 01:23:15,200
(Which team will keep their name
tags and have the last laugh?)

2520
01:23:15,780 --> 01:23:17,520
(Idol versus Running Man,
Center's Dignity)
