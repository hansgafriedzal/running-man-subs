1
00:00:05,860 --> 00:00:08,990
(One March day
at a restaurant in Mapo-gu)

2
00:00:10,430 --> 00:00:12,800
(Haha is the first one to arrive.)

3
00:00:13,600 --> 00:00:15,290
- Is this your first time here?
- Yes.

4
00:00:15,350 --> 00:00:16,360
- Hello.
- Hello.

5
00:00:16,360 --> 00:00:19,130
(Things are somewhat different
than usual for the opening.)

6
00:00:19,130 --> 00:00:20,600
- Hello.
- I know it.

7
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:22,270
I pretend to know everyone's name.

8
00:00:22,670 --> 00:00:24,670
Namkoong is a unique name.

9
00:00:25,360 --> 00:00:27,240
- Can I go in?
- Yes, please.

10
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:30,450
(He goes into the filming room.)

11
00:00:34,380 --> 00:00:35,950
(Surprised)

12
00:00:35,950 --> 00:00:36,990
What is this?

13
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:39,490
(It's an empty room
with no one around.)

14
00:00:39,490 --> 00:00:41,850
What's going on? Why is no one here?

15
00:00:41,850 --> 00:00:43,780
These are seats for the guests.

16
00:00:45,090 --> 00:00:47,420
(There's not even a crew member.)

17
00:00:47,420 --> 00:00:49,020
Why am I alone?

18
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:52,340
(A sense of anxiety comes over him.)

19
00:00:52,340 --> 00:00:55,460
What's going on?
Hey, why are you here so early?

20
00:00:55,460 --> 00:00:57,810
- I was asked to come early.
- You got a mission, didn't you?

21
00:00:58,030 --> 00:00:59,670
- Not at all.
- I'm sure you did.

22
00:00:59,670 --> 00:01:01,130
(He's misunderstood
just because he came early.)

23
00:01:01,130 --> 00:01:03,380
- Gosh, this is...
- Just tell me the truth.

24
00:01:03,380 --> 00:01:05,200
- Haha.
- This is crazy.

25
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:06,480
- I'm serious.
- Hello.

26
00:01:06,480 --> 00:01:07,570
- Haha.
- Will you lie to us?

27
00:01:07,570 --> 00:01:09,190
- Hello.
- He was sitting here alone.

28
00:01:09,190 --> 00:01:10,890
- He's a spy.
- It doesn't make sense.

29
00:01:10,890 --> 00:01:12,860
- I was on the fourth floor.
- This is strange.

30
00:01:13,110 --> 00:01:14,490
- What? Are we eating?
- Hello.

31
00:01:14,490 --> 00:01:16,390
- I guess we're eating.
- I think Haha got a mission.

32
00:01:16,390 --> 00:01:18,280
- He came early.
- He was sitting here alone.

33
00:01:18,280 --> 00:01:19,330
What about Haha?

34
00:01:19,330 --> 00:01:20,600
- He was waiting for us.
- What's going on?

35
00:01:20,600 --> 00:01:21,750
- What?
- He was here waiting.

36
00:01:21,750 --> 00:01:23,660
- He's being suspicious.
- We get a bag like this...

37
00:01:23,660 --> 00:01:24,830
all the time.

38
00:01:24,830 --> 00:01:25,830
What?

39
00:01:25,830 --> 00:01:27,770
Since when did we have cameras
that moved like this?

40
00:01:27,770 --> 00:01:29,910
This is amazing.
The camera is moving.

41
00:01:29,970 --> 00:01:31,940
- So Min.
- Don't be silly.

42
00:01:31,940 --> 00:01:33,970
Is this your first time seeing that?

43
00:01:33,970 --> 00:01:36,410
So Min dyed her hair.

44
00:01:36,410 --> 00:01:37,610
Oh, right.

45
00:01:37,610 --> 00:01:39,350
Doesn't she look Russian?

46
00:01:39,580 --> 00:01:40,880
So Min, can you show us?

47
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:42,780
- Eastern Europe.
- Right. Eastern Europe.

48
00:01:42,780 --> 00:01:43,780
(Tetris dance)

49
00:01:43,780 --> 00:01:45,950
She looks like a woman
from Eastern Europe.

50
00:01:45,950 --> 00:01:47,250
I agree.

51
00:01:47,250 --> 00:01:49,990
- Press it.
- Do we have R coins already?

52
00:01:50,190 --> 00:01:51,330
What?

53
00:01:51,330 --> 00:01:53,550
What? When did we get this?

54
00:01:53,890 --> 00:01:55,770
Hey, if someone picks these up...

55
00:01:55,890 --> 00:01:57,130
- So Min.
- Jae Suk.

56
00:01:57,130 --> 00:01:59,100
We haven't started yet.
You can't do this.

57
00:01:59,100 --> 00:02:00,940
Give me that. Hey.

58
00:02:00,940 --> 00:02:02,160
- Give it back to me.
- This is mine.

59
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:03,160
- Give it here, punk.
- It's mine.

60
00:02:03,160 --> 00:02:05,140
- So Min, your hair...
- Don't lie to me.

61
00:02:05,140 --> 00:02:06,830
- That's not true.
- You can count them.

62
00:02:06,830 --> 00:02:08,140
How many do you have?

63
00:02:08,580 --> 00:02:09,780
Last time,

64
00:02:09,780 --> 00:02:11,470
- I got gum.
- That's terrible.

65
00:02:11,470 --> 00:02:14,380
- It's the worst.
- Seriously, this is mine.

66
00:02:14,380 --> 00:02:16,350
- Hang on.
- Guys, please help me.

67
00:02:16,350 --> 00:02:18,150
What's wrong with her?
I didn't take your coins.

68
00:02:18,150 --> 00:02:20,480
- What's wrong?
- I didn't take your coins.

69
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:21,620
You can check my bag.

70
00:02:21,620 --> 00:02:22,960
- Jae Suk hid his.
- Why?

71
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:24,090
- Stand up.
- We should be a team.

72
00:02:24,630 --> 00:02:26,400
I can't trust you.

73
00:02:26,630 --> 00:02:29,220
- I'm 36 years old now.
- I saw that.

74
00:02:29,220 --> 00:02:30,690
(What really happened?)

75
00:02:30,690 --> 00:02:32,840
(While Ji Hyo looked away,)

76
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:34,870
(he stole 2 coins.)

77
00:02:34,870 --> 00:02:36,970
(As he tried to put them
in his bag,)

78
00:02:36,970 --> 00:02:38,760
(she gets a glimpse.)

79
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:40,130
(Give me that.)

80
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:42,310
(Ji Hyo ended up losing 1 coin.)

81
00:02:42,310 --> 00:02:44,040
It's not over yet.

82
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:46,220
- It's not started yet.
- We should wait.

83
00:02:46,220 --> 00:02:48,780
Did you watch their commercial?

84
00:02:48,780 --> 00:02:51,310
- They did a commercial together.
- Did you watch it?

85
00:02:51,310 --> 00:02:53,060
I have 18 coins and he has 21.

86
00:02:53,060 --> 00:02:55,510
- Give it to her. Let me count mine.
- We're talking at the same time.

87
00:02:55,510 --> 00:02:56,750
(Tired)

88
00:02:56,750 --> 00:02:57,960
You have 21 coins while we have 20.

89
00:02:57,960 --> 00:02:59,400
I guess we're doing something here.

90
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:00,530
Let me see.

91
00:03:00,530 --> 00:03:02,260
- You should watch it.
- This is open at the bottom.

92
00:03:02,260 --> 00:03:03,260
(After chatting for a while...)

93
00:03:03,260 --> 00:03:04,400
Why are we doing this?

94
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:05,730
I was asked not to eat
before I come.

95
00:03:05,730 --> 00:03:07,470
- This is a little awkward.
- What?

96
00:03:07,470 --> 00:03:09,810
- I had a big meal earlier.
- I didn't eat.

97
00:03:10,100 --> 00:03:11,940
(Two women are approaching.)

98
00:03:11,940 --> 00:03:14,070
- Excuse me.
- Gosh.

99
00:03:15,570 --> 00:03:17,850
(Today's guests)

100
00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:21,680
(Comediennes Hong Hyun Hee
and Kim Ji Min)

101
00:03:22,180 --> 00:03:24,040
(Welcome)

102
00:03:24,440 --> 00:03:26,380
- Ji Min.
- You've lost a lot of weight.

103
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:28,480
- She looks different.
- Hello.

104
00:03:28,510 --> 00:03:31,320
- Hello.
- She's become so prettier.

105
00:03:31,530 --> 00:03:33,060
I haven't changed that much.

106
00:03:33,060 --> 00:03:34,600
- Have a seat.
- You've lost a lot of weight.

107
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:36,400
You look so much better.
Your face is so small.

108
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:37,660
You look healthy.

109
00:03:37,660 --> 00:03:39,940
- I like your hair. It looks good.
- Now that I lost weight,

110
00:03:39,940 --> 00:03:42,260
- the wave looks better.
- You look pretty.

111
00:03:42,260 --> 00:03:44,210
You look perfect.

112
00:03:44,210 --> 00:03:45,970
She has a pretty face.

113
00:03:45,970 --> 00:03:47,880
You're so pretty. You look cute.

114
00:03:47,880 --> 00:03:49,180
My features?

115
00:03:49,180 --> 00:03:52,070
Why did you lose weight?
They don't even care about me.

116
00:03:52,070 --> 00:03:54,310
(She's upset that Hyun Hee gets
all the attention.)

117
00:03:54,310 --> 00:03:56,380
- Ji Min.
- So this is how it feels.

118
00:03:56,380 --> 00:03:57,980
- Ji Min.
- It feels so good.

119
00:03:57,980 --> 00:04:00,090
- We will talk to you too.
- We should talk to Ji Min.

120
00:04:00,090 --> 00:04:01,750
Ji Min's wearing snakeskin.

121
00:04:01,750 --> 00:04:03,530
Right. That's what I'm wearing.

122
00:04:03,530 --> 00:04:05,380
It looks unique.

123
00:04:05,590 --> 00:04:07,220
Is it a jacket?

124
00:04:07,220 --> 00:04:09,500
I just got goosebumps
as I looked to the right.

125
00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:11,000
I just saw Se Chan's face.

126
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,100
After I lost weight,
I gained confidence.

127
00:04:13,100 --> 00:04:15,500
So my husband and I tried this app
where you can switch faces.

128
00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:17,870
And my face was
switched to Se Chan's.

129
00:04:19,070 --> 00:04:20,230
Really?

130
00:04:20,230 --> 00:04:23,350
- Seriously?
- Because I have a protruding mouth.

131
00:04:23,350 --> 00:04:25,580
- They look alike.
- She kept getting Se Chan's face.

132
00:04:25,580 --> 00:04:28,450
- I think they look alike.
- See? I look just like him.

133
00:04:28,470 --> 00:04:30,320
Gosh, look at this.

134
00:04:30,590 --> 00:04:32,480
- This is Se Chan.
- Se Chan!

135
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:33,960
- This is Se Chan's face.
- Se Chan.

136
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:35,720
- It's unbelievable.
- My gosh.

137
00:04:35,890 --> 00:04:37,680
(Se Chan is even more surprised.)

138
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:38,680
Hyun Hee.

139
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:41,350
If you keep using this app,
you'll get more photos of Se Chan.

140
00:04:42,290 --> 00:04:44,220
This is scary.

141
00:04:44,220 --> 00:04:45,600
- I guess my gene...
- Se Chan.

142
00:04:45,860 --> 00:04:48,140
- My gene is very strong.
- It's really strong.

143
00:04:48,140 --> 00:04:50,510
To be honest, Se Chan
has become ugly these days.

144
00:04:50,530 --> 00:04:51,730
Why?

145
00:04:51,730 --> 00:04:53,430
- He just looks ugly.
- I feel offended.

146
00:04:54,140 --> 00:04:56,010
- He just looks ugly.
- I feel offended.

147
00:04:56,370 --> 00:04:57,670
Why would you feel offended?

148
00:04:57,670 --> 00:04:59,080
- Never mind.
- She didn't mean you.

149
00:04:59,080 --> 00:05:00,280
She didn't say that to you.

150
00:05:01,220 --> 00:05:02,890
You don't have to be mad.

151
00:05:02,890 --> 00:05:04,040
- No.
- She wasn't talking to you.

152
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:05,760
- You look good these days.
- I feel offended.

153
00:05:05,850 --> 00:05:08,320
I got mad as she said
Se Chan is ugly.

154
00:05:09,530 --> 00:05:11,090
You two look good together though.

155
00:05:11,980 --> 00:05:13,660
- Hello.
- We should place an order.

156
00:05:13,660 --> 00:05:14,900
Thank you.

157
00:05:14,900 --> 00:05:16,160
- Are we eating here?
- Yes.

158
00:05:16,420 --> 00:05:18,290
- What are we doing?
- Are we eating here?

159
00:05:18,290 --> 00:05:19,660
Is this it?

160
00:05:19,660 --> 00:05:20,970
- This is the beginning.
- There must be something.

161
00:05:20,970 --> 00:05:22,800
- I'm sure something's going on.
- We're here to eat.

162
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:24,770
- Hey, are we teams like this?
- That will be fine.

163
00:05:24,770 --> 00:05:26,030
(Something doesn't feel right.)

164
00:05:26,030 --> 00:05:27,470
I guess we're a team.

165
00:05:27,470 --> 00:05:28,840
- Really?
- Two teams like this?

166
00:05:29,300 --> 00:05:30,540
Let's just eat.

167
00:05:30,540 --> 00:05:32,240
- Hang on.
- Wait. Why is he...

168
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:33,670
Why are you trying to lead us?

169
00:05:33,740 --> 00:05:35,080
- Did you get a mission?
- He's being strange.

170
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:36,450
Haha is being strange.

171
00:05:36,450 --> 00:05:38,410
He was sitting here alone
waiting for us.

172
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:40,680
- I just came early.
- He usually doesn't come early.

173
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:41,910
I just got here early.

174
00:05:42,110 --> 00:05:44,160
(What is going on?)

175
00:05:45,050 --> 00:05:46,900
- I'll have hairtail.
- Me too.

176
00:05:46,900 --> 00:05:48,420
- I'll have grilled hairtail.
- Grilled hairtail.

177
00:05:48,420 --> 00:05:50,070
Two grilled hairtails, please.

178
00:05:50,490 --> 00:05:52,490
It feels like we're
having a get-together.

179
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:55,030
Give us some soju and beer.

180
00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:56,660
We're not having a party.

181
00:05:56,730 --> 00:05:58,510
Beer and soju, please.

182
00:05:58,570 --> 00:06:00,730
It's so loud when we're together.

183
00:06:01,030 --> 00:06:03,040
It's not like we're having a party.
What are we doing here?

184
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:04,210
This is nice though.

185
00:06:04,210 --> 00:06:06,520
- It's very nice to eat together.
- This is our first time.

186
00:06:07,540 --> 00:06:09,740
- There's no trash can in here.
- What?

187
00:06:09,740 --> 00:06:11,240
- I can't throw this way.
- Give me that.

188
00:06:11,390 --> 00:06:12,480
I will...

189
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:14,720
(Jae Suk goes out
to throw away the garbage.)

190
00:06:16,260 --> 00:06:17,550
Can we get some water, please?

191
00:06:18,390 --> 00:06:19,830
(He keeps asking for something,)

192
00:06:19,830 --> 00:06:21,260
Could you get us some water?

193
00:06:21,260 --> 00:06:22,400
(but it's quiet.)

194
00:06:23,270 --> 00:06:26,930
(Something's strange.)

195
00:06:26,930 --> 00:06:28,070
What is going on?

196
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:31,070
- Jae Suk.
- Yes?

197
00:06:31,140 --> 00:06:33,230
- Give us five coins.
- Why?

198
00:06:33,510 --> 00:06:35,030
Today is a Race of Wits.

199
00:06:35,950 --> 00:06:38,600
We will get five coins from members
who leave the room in an hour.

200
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:40,040
(Those who leave the room
will hand in 5 coins.)

201
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:41,370
- My gosh.
- Since you're out,

202
00:06:41,370 --> 00:06:43,980
- you need to give us five coins.
- I'm just here to get some water.

203
00:06:43,980 --> 00:06:46,090
It will be advantageous to you
if you let other members leave.

204
00:06:46,090 --> 00:06:47,550
This is ridiculous.

205
00:06:47,610 --> 00:06:50,780
You left the room without focusing
on the shoot. Give us the coins.

206
00:06:50,850 --> 00:06:54,760
I just came out to throw out
some garbage and get some water.

207
00:06:54,760 --> 00:06:55,920
Everyone's thirsty.

208
00:06:55,920 --> 00:06:57,860
We'd like you to focus
more on the shoot.

209
00:06:58,030 --> 00:06:59,270
(Frustrated)

210
00:06:59,270 --> 00:07:00,840
All right. So this is
how it's going to be.

211
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:02,800
Five coins.

212
00:07:05,030 --> 00:07:07,280
(He just spilled R coins
feeling frustrated.)

213
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:09,080
Gosh, I'm so upset.

214
00:07:09,540 --> 00:07:11,600
I can't believe this.

215
00:07:13,540 --> 00:07:15,350
(They all are chatting away
without knowing anything.)

216
00:07:15,350 --> 00:07:17,650
- You mean Jason could do better.
- That's what I thought at first.

217
00:07:18,110 --> 00:07:20,180
(He sits down quietly.)

218
00:07:20,180 --> 00:07:22,680
(He taps Kwang Soo quietly
with his leg.)

219
00:07:24,420 --> 00:07:26,530
(What?)

220
00:07:27,030 --> 00:07:29,470
(Check outside, Kwang Soo.)

221
00:07:30,900 --> 00:07:33,570
(Kwang Soo sensed something.)

222
00:07:33,570 --> 00:07:35,860
(And he leaves quietly.)

223
00:07:36,730 --> 00:07:39,870
(What is it? I guess
something's going on.)

224
00:07:43,350 --> 00:07:44,540
Jae Suk told me to come out.

225
00:07:45,100 --> 00:07:46,410
- Kwang Soo.
- Yes?

226
00:07:46,850 --> 00:07:48,610
- You've failed your mission.
- What?

227
00:07:48,610 --> 00:07:50,220
We'd like you
to hand in five R coins.

228
00:07:51,320 --> 00:07:52,390
Why?

229
00:07:52,980 --> 00:07:55,680
Because you didn't
focus on the shoot.

230
00:07:56,090 --> 00:07:57,180
So you need to hand in five coins.

231
00:07:57,180 --> 00:07:59,490
Jae Suk tapped me with his leg
and told me to leave.

232
00:07:59,700 --> 00:08:01,220
You left the room
without focusing on the shoot.

233
00:08:02,700 --> 00:08:04,200
That's not true.

234
00:08:04,990 --> 00:08:06,140
You may go back now.

235
00:08:06,140 --> 00:08:07,600
(Kwang Soo lost 5 coins.)

236
00:08:08,140 --> 00:08:10,140
- I talked to them.
- Why aren't they giving us water?

237
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:12,010
- Suk Jin.
- What?

238
00:08:12,100 --> 00:08:13,210
The garbage.

239
00:08:13,670 --> 00:08:14,840
The garbage?

240
00:08:14,910 --> 00:08:16,080
- Give me that.
- There's a trash can out there.

241
00:08:16,210 --> 00:08:17,410
Go throw it away.

242
00:08:18,580 --> 00:08:19,610
Thank you.

243
00:08:19,610 --> 00:08:20,670
(He suddenly gives it to Ji Hyo.)

244
00:08:20,670 --> 00:08:21,950
- Here, I'll go.
- Ji Hyo.

245
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:23,850
Let Suk Jin throw it away.

246
00:08:24,910 --> 00:08:26,910
- Why?
- Ji Hyo does it a lot.

247
00:08:26,910 --> 00:08:28,610
- You should do this.
- Let's play rock-paper-scissors.

248
00:08:28,760 --> 00:08:29,920
<i>Rock-paper-scissors</i>

249
00:08:29,980 --> 00:08:31,980
(Suk Jin wins.)

250
00:08:32,420 --> 00:08:33,530
You should do it.

251
00:08:34,260 --> 00:08:35,970
You do it.
Ji Hyo does it all the time.

252
00:08:35,970 --> 00:08:38,170
(Jae Suk just kicks him out.)

253
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:39,760
(Suk Jin is forced out.)

254
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:41,760
Where can I throw this away?

255
00:08:43,630 --> 00:08:44,760
Where can I throw this away?

256
00:08:45,860 --> 00:08:47,270
- This is crazy.
- There's something here.

257
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,550
- What?
- My gosh.

258
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:51,310
- What's going on?
- Suk Jin.

259
00:08:51,310 --> 00:08:52,870
- Yes?
- You've failed your mission.

260
00:08:52,950 --> 00:08:54,610
We'd like you
to hand in five R coins.

261
00:08:54,820 --> 00:08:55,980
We'll take five coins.

262
00:08:55,980 --> 00:08:58,050
This is ridiculous.

263
00:08:58,740 --> 00:09:00,720
I should tell them to come out then.

264
00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:03,190
I knew it was strange.

265
00:09:05,460 --> 00:09:07,330
- Where did you go?
- What?

266
00:09:07,330 --> 00:09:09,260
(He smiles after fooling him.)

267
00:09:09,260 --> 00:09:11,300
- Where did you go, Kwang Soo?
- He got his mission.

268
00:09:11,300 --> 00:09:12,520
Where is Suk Jin?

269
00:09:12,520 --> 00:09:14,700
- Is he on a mission?
- He's out to throw away garbage.

270
00:09:14,700 --> 00:09:16,340
And why did you go out?

271
00:09:16,670 --> 00:09:18,860
- I went to ask for water.
- I see.

272
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:22,340
(I should fool Se Chan this time.)

273
00:09:22,740 --> 00:09:24,310
- Se Chan, go ask for water.
- Okay.

274
00:09:24,310 --> 00:09:25,770
- I asked earlier, but...
- I know.

275
00:09:25,870 --> 00:09:27,010
Why are you taking that with you?

276
00:09:27,010 --> 00:09:28,550
Hey, why are you taking the bag?

277
00:09:28,550 --> 00:09:30,380
You'd steal my coins.
I can't let that happen.

278
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:31,510
I have to keep my coins.

279
00:09:31,510 --> 00:09:33,690
(Kwang Soo tries to fool Jong Kook.)

280
00:09:33,690 --> 00:09:35,880
(You should go out.)

281
00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:37,380
(Okay.)

282
00:09:37,560 --> 00:09:38,960
You can just ring the bell.
Why would you go out?

283
00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:40,300
This is strange.
Why are they all leaving?

284
00:09:40,390 --> 00:09:41,830
- What's going on?
- I just...

285
00:09:42,520 --> 00:09:43,890
need to go to the bathroom.

286
00:09:43,890 --> 00:09:45,570
(Are we supposed to leave the room?)

287
00:09:46,130 --> 00:09:48,600
Kwang Soo just went out
with his injured leg.

288
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:49,940
- Why are they leaving?
- Why did you do that?

289
00:09:50,230 --> 00:09:51,670
If you're curious,
you should go out.

290
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:53,630
- So Min.
- What's going on?

291
00:09:53,630 --> 00:09:54,970
(You should go out.)

292
00:09:55,810 --> 00:09:57,680
(Should I go out?)

293
00:09:57,680 --> 00:09:58,870
(Standing up)

294
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:01,470
(As Suk Jin sends a signal,)

295
00:10:01,470 --> 00:10:03,720
(Ji Hyo gets up too.)

296
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:07,610
(They feel like they shouldn't be
the last one to leave.)

297
00:10:07,610 --> 00:10:09,880
(Haha gets up too.)

298
00:10:11,880 --> 00:10:12,930
Why are they leaving?

299
00:10:14,930 --> 00:10:16,330
(They just can't hide their smiles.)

300
00:10:16,330 --> 00:10:17,520
- Is something going on?
- What?

301
00:10:17,520 --> 00:10:18,600
What's going on?

302
00:10:18,970 --> 00:10:20,100
Is this a prank?

303
00:10:20,760 --> 00:10:21,760
(Snorting)

304
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:25,100
(While Jae Suk gives
a snort in joy...)

305
00:10:25,100 --> 00:10:26,940
Se Chan and Jong Kook.

306
00:10:27,180 --> 00:10:29,810
You've failed your mission.
Hand in five R coins.

307
00:10:31,050 --> 00:10:34,320
- What?
- Jae Suk came out, so...

308
00:10:34,680 --> 00:10:36,480
Because he came out.

309
00:10:37,190 --> 00:10:40,820
When Jae Suk came back,
I thought he didn't look happy.

310
00:10:41,190 --> 00:10:42,290
Hand in five coins.

311
00:10:42,290 --> 00:10:44,850
(So Min and Ji Hyo lose
5 coins too.)

312
00:10:44,850 --> 00:10:47,020
Haha, you've failed your mission.

313
00:10:47,330 --> 00:10:48,800
Give us five R coins.

314
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:50,970
(He hears the bad news
as soon as he gets out.)

315
00:10:50,970 --> 00:10:52,470
I can't believe this.

316
00:10:52,520 --> 00:10:53,630
I'll get them later.

317
00:10:54,100 --> 00:10:56,130
- We have one person left.
- So all the members left the room?

318
00:10:56,210 --> 00:10:57,840
- Yes.
- What? Why?

319
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:01,540
(He smacks Kwang Soo in anger.)

320
00:11:01,540 --> 00:11:02,810
One more person needs to go out.

321
00:11:03,640 --> 00:11:05,350
(Why are you clapping?
You're the same.)

322
00:11:05,350 --> 00:11:07,220
Why did you do that to us?

323
00:11:07,370 --> 00:11:08,470
Come here.

324
00:11:08,470 --> 00:11:10,350
- I can't believe this.
- Gosh.

325
00:11:11,350 --> 00:11:12,450
What?

326
00:11:12,450 --> 00:11:13,750
(What's going on?)

327
00:11:14,220 --> 00:11:16,330
- What?
- I had no idea.

328
00:11:16,330 --> 00:11:18,750
- Go ask for water.
- Okay, I'll go get some water.

329
00:11:18,750 --> 00:11:19,750
Where do I go?

330
00:11:19,750 --> 00:11:21,060
I was surprised
when I went out there.

331
00:11:21,060 --> 00:11:22,220
You all are unbelievable.

332
00:11:22,220 --> 00:11:23,490
- I know.
- Nice.

333
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:25,100
- So it's reset.
- I'm so disappointed.

334
00:11:25,100 --> 00:11:26,860
- You are evil.
- You're so mean.

335
00:11:26,860 --> 00:11:28,670
If one of us leaves...

336
00:11:28,670 --> 00:11:30,230
- You're the worst.
- It could happen.

337
00:11:30,230 --> 00:11:32,500
- I shouldn't have left.
- You left because it was strange.

338
00:11:32,500 --> 00:11:34,580
We did it out of greed.
We wanted to get something.

339
00:11:34,580 --> 00:11:36,140
We should've stayed here.

340
00:11:36,140 --> 00:11:38,140
(There's one more victim.)

341
00:11:39,080 --> 00:11:41,580
- Welcome back.
- Hyun Hee. Did you order water?

342
00:11:41,580 --> 00:11:43,290
- So we're starting over again.
- See?

343
00:11:43,290 --> 00:11:44,320
I shouldn't have left.

344
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:46,480
It was so funny. When I came back,

345
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:48,560
I just tapped Kwang Soo
with a foot without saying anything.

346
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:50,060
(And he fell for it right away.)

347
00:11:50,060 --> 00:11:52,830
His face seemed serious.
I had to believe him.

348
00:11:54,120 --> 00:11:55,120
You thought he was
only talking to you.

349
00:11:55,390 --> 00:11:57,600
(Jae Suk's face phishing is
scarier than voice phishing.)

350
00:11:57,600 --> 00:11:59,170
You thought he was
only talking to you.

351
00:11:59,300 --> 00:12:00,940
So I was very moved.

352
00:12:01,340 --> 00:12:02,570
I was deeply touched.

353
00:12:02,570 --> 00:12:03,970
(He was moved as he thought
Jae Suk was being nice to him.)

354
00:12:04,130 --> 00:12:06,770
I'm cautious about what I do.
What would be next?

355
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:08,940
If we go out of the room again,
do we have to pay again?

356
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,640
- I don't know.
- I'm not sure about that.

357
00:12:10,640 --> 00:12:12,920
If you leave again,
something good might happen.

358
00:12:12,920 --> 00:12:14,350
It might be something good.

359
00:12:15,550 --> 00:12:16,790
I should go out then.

360
00:12:17,590 --> 00:12:19,190
- I will.
- Hey.

361
00:12:19,750 --> 00:12:21,590
(As Jae Suk tries to leave...)

362
00:12:21,590 --> 00:12:23,790
(Kwang Soo sprints out.)

363
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:26,720
- That was quick.
- Is his leg okay?

364
00:12:26,830 --> 00:12:28,350
Is his leg okay?

365
00:12:28,350 --> 00:12:30,260
- Why is he so fast?
- He's just like before he got hurt.

366
00:12:30,260 --> 00:12:31,620
He walks fine.

367
00:12:32,570 --> 00:12:35,800
(He's like Keyser Soze
from "The Usual Suspects.")

368
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:38,570
(Keyser Kwang Soo)

369
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:42,270
(He hurries his steps as if
he needs to go to the bathroom.)

370
00:12:42,270 --> 00:12:44,740
Kwang Soo, you are out again.

371
00:12:45,500 --> 00:12:46,970
Since you didn't focus on the shoot,

372
00:12:46,970 --> 00:12:48,240
I'll get another
five coins from you.

373
00:12:50,050 --> 00:12:51,110
Give me your coins.

374
00:12:51,220 --> 00:12:52,420
You did it before.

375
00:12:52,420 --> 00:12:55,510
(He has come all the way here
with his injured leg.)

376
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:57,930
Are you serious?

377
00:12:57,930 --> 00:12:59,600
(Wasn't it a good thing?)

378
00:13:01,300 --> 00:13:02,520
He's back. Look at his face.

379
00:13:02,620 --> 00:13:04,330
Okay? He said okay.

380
00:13:05,100 --> 00:13:06,360
You lost another five coins, right?

381
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:07,840
No.

382
00:13:08,300 --> 00:13:09,600
Let me tell you one thing.

383
00:13:10,730 --> 00:13:12,360
- It's begun.
- We don't have much time.

384
00:13:12,710 --> 00:13:14,310
- It's done.
- There's not much time.

385
00:13:14,310 --> 00:13:15,580
- Just have a seat.
- Okay.

386
00:13:15,580 --> 00:13:17,000
As he came back in...

387
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,100
I'm curious though.

388
00:13:18,550 --> 00:13:20,350
Because...

389
00:13:20,350 --> 00:13:23,190
- it might be a double fake.
- That's right.

390
00:13:23,190 --> 00:13:24,610
- That's what I'm afraid of.
- A double fake.

391
00:13:24,610 --> 00:13:25,820
There might be something good.

392
00:13:25,820 --> 00:13:27,750
Let's play rock-paper-scissors
and let the loser go out.

393
00:13:27,980 --> 00:13:30,190
(He fails to hold himself back
and gets up.)

394
00:13:30,350 --> 00:13:32,330
What if we get 10 R coins?

395
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:33,650
What if they give 20 R coins?

396
00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:34,990
Is that it?

397
00:13:34,990 --> 00:13:36,600
We might get all the coins
they collected earlier.

398
00:13:37,300 --> 00:13:39,070
- What?
- They got five coins from us each.

399
00:13:39,070 --> 00:13:41,040
I'm telling you this because
I can't go out again anyway.

400
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:42,390
I can't go out again.

401
00:13:42,390 --> 00:13:43,810
But there aren't many chances left.

402
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:45,600
No.

403
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:46,730
Wait, Suk Jin.

404
00:13:46,730 --> 00:13:48,340
- Wait.
- Let me go.

405
00:13:48,340 --> 00:13:50,550
The unlucky ones are moving now.
It means it's not good.

406
00:13:50,640 --> 00:13:51,850
I'm serious.

407
00:13:51,900 --> 00:13:53,350
I'm only saying this because
I can't go out again.

408
00:13:53,450 --> 00:13:55,050
The unlucky ones are moving now.

409
00:13:55,050 --> 00:13:56,240
I pushed him out.

410
00:13:56,850 --> 00:13:59,420
(He forces Suk Jin out.)

411
00:14:00,190 --> 00:14:02,190
It was your plan.

412
00:14:02,610 --> 00:14:03,850
- I let Suk Jin out.
- You pushed him out.

413
00:14:03,850 --> 00:14:04,980
Good job.

414
00:14:05,090 --> 00:14:07,250
It was like when you pretend
to throw a ball...

415
00:14:07,250 --> 00:14:08,330
and your dog would fall for it.

416
00:14:08,750 --> 00:14:10,720
- He looked just like that.
- He fooled Suk Jin.

417
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:11,930
Is it a good thing or not?

418
00:14:11,930 --> 00:14:13,490
Just be honest with us.

419
00:14:13,490 --> 00:14:14,670
It's not good.

420
00:14:15,840 --> 00:14:17,760
- It's a good thing.
- Is it good?

421
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:18,840
You'll see it on Suk Jin's face.

422
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:21,080
We should wait and see
how Suk Jin reacts.

423
00:14:21,370 --> 00:14:24,100
Since you didn't focus again,
I'll get another five coins.

424
00:14:24,100 --> 00:14:26,080
(No, it's not good.)

425
00:14:27,850 --> 00:14:29,320
(His blood pressure is going up.)

426
00:14:29,320 --> 00:14:30,740
Please stay focused.

427
00:14:31,190 --> 00:14:32,610
(Sad)

428
00:14:32,980 --> 00:14:34,820
This is a war of wits.

429
00:14:34,820 --> 00:14:35,980
I know.
It's like "believe it or not."

430
00:14:35,980 --> 00:14:37,090
It's not a good thing.

431
00:14:37,220 --> 00:14:39,990
He smiled as soon as he got in.
He's bitter.

432
00:14:39,990 --> 00:14:42,100
He's smiling because
it's something absurd.

433
00:14:42,100 --> 00:14:43,970
- He's mad.
- How can I put this?

434
00:14:44,570 --> 00:14:46,540
(Everybody is looking at him.)

435
00:14:46,670 --> 00:14:48,730
- Is nobody else going?
- No.

436
00:14:48,730 --> 00:14:50,040
- That's not it.
- Let's just see what happens.

437
00:14:51,210 --> 00:14:52,500
- That's not it.
- Let's just see what happens.

438
00:14:53,470 --> 00:14:54,500
- Are you going again?
- Are you seriously not going?

439
00:14:54,500 --> 00:14:56,230
Leave him.

440
00:14:56,230 --> 00:14:57,350
- Are you going again?
- Are you seriously not going?

441
00:14:57,350 --> 00:14:58,450
(No, we're not going.)

442
00:14:58,450 --> 00:15:00,080
- We're not going.
- He just said...

443
00:15:00,080 --> 00:15:01,950
- he can't go more than twice.
- He did.

444
00:15:01,950 --> 00:15:03,850
Why are you trying to...

445
00:15:03,850 --> 00:15:05,320
- aggravate us?
- Are you really not going?

446
00:15:05,320 --> 00:15:06,920
- I'm serious.
- You said you can't go again.

447
00:15:06,920 --> 00:15:08,650
- You said you can't go again.
- Go ahead.

448
00:15:08,980 --> 00:15:11,690
Why are you going again?
He has the door open. Go.

449
00:15:11,690 --> 00:15:13,120
- Stop it.
- Why are you doing this?

450
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:14,750
- Are you not going?
- Hey, Jae Suk.

451
00:15:14,750 --> 00:15:15,850
Jae Suk.

452
00:15:15,850 --> 00:15:17,620
- Move.
- What?

453
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:18,800
But...

454
00:15:18,890 --> 00:15:20,390
- He got tricked.
- Sit down.

455
00:15:20,730 --> 00:15:22,360
Just sit.

456
00:15:22,670 --> 00:15:25,470
(It sounds like he's acting.)

457
00:15:25,470 --> 00:15:27,100
That makes me actually want to sit.

458
00:15:27,870 --> 00:15:29,400
What was that for?

459
00:15:29,640 --> 00:15:30,970
What's wrong with you?

460
00:15:30,970 --> 00:15:32,470
I was about to go out.

461
00:15:32,470 --> 00:15:34,510
I was about to go,
but I sat down because of Suk Jin.

462
00:15:34,510 --> 00:15:36,510
"Just sit."

463
00:15:36,510 --> 00:15:38,140
He never shares anything good.

464
00:15:38,140 --> 00:15:39,790
I'm relieved.

465
00:15:40,150 --> 00:15:42,750
(I almost had them.)

466
00:15:43,380 --> 00:15:45,380
Focus. Why do you keep
going back and forth?

467
00:15:45,380 --> 00:15:48,250
- That's why you're losing coins.
- Focus!

468
00:15:48,250 --> 00:15:49,890
- That was too obvious.
- Sit.

469
00:15:49,890 --> 00:15:51,200
- Are you sure? Okay.
- We're not going.

470
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:52,620
(He goes out for the 3rd time.)

471
00:15:52,620 --> 00:15:53,630
What's going on?

472
00:15:53,630 --> 00:15:55,800
- He's trying to trick us.
- It's a race.

473
00:15:55,800 --> 00:15:59,570
- It's something good.
- He said he can't go out again.

474
00:15:59,570 --> 00:16:00,870
He would have gone
back and forth already then.

475
00:16:00,870 --> 00:16:02,470
- It doesn't make sense.
- You can't go more than twice.

476
00:16:02,870 --> 00:16:04,970
Jae Suk is so gullible.

477
00:16:04,970 --> 00:16:06,140
Do you want to go?

478
00:16:06,140 --> 00:16:07,580
Are you sure about this?

479
00:16:07,580 --> 00:16:08,770
I'm not sure.

480
00:16:08,770 --> 00:16:10,290
Move over. I can't resist.

481
00:16:10,290 --> 00:16:11,950
- Throw out one of them.
- I can't resist.

482
00:16:11,950 --> 00:16:13,590
Are they both going?

483
00:16:13,880 --> 00:16:15,380
(Kwang Soo came out first.)

484
00:16:15,380 --> 00:16:16,480
Kwang Soo...

485
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:18,980
Since you didn't focus on filming
for the third time,

486
00:16:18,980 --> 00:16:20,800
so you must pay five coins.

487
00:16:21,620 --> 00:16:23,200
So you must pay five coins.

488
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:24,600
(Kwang Soo slaps his cheek in fury.)

489
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:26,540
- Does this keep going?
- When will you focus?

490
00:16:26,540 --> 00:16:29,130
Focus? I'm focusing.

491
00:16:29,230 --> 00:16:30,500
I'm focusing on the mission.

492
00:16:30,500 --> 00:16:32,070
Please focus on the conversation.

493
00:16:33,180 --> 00:16:36,130
(He pays 5 more coins
for a total of 15 coins.)

494
00:16:36,870 --> 00:16:38,740
(He looks lonely from the back.)

495
00:16:38,740 --> 00:16:39,770
I couldn't resist.

496
00:16:39,770 --> 00:16:40,820
(2 more guests come.)

497
00:16:40,820 --> 00:16:44,420
Since you didn't focus on filming
again, you must pay five coins.

498
00:16:45,010 --> 00:16:47,420
- I thought we'd get something good.
- It's not.

499
00:16:47,420 --> 00:16:48,960
Please focus.

500
00:16:48,960 --> 00:16:51,020
Why did you push me?

501
00:16:51,460 --> 00:16:52,790
My gosh.

502
00:16:52,790 --> 00:16:54,720
(They take out 5 coins to pay.)

503
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:56,200
(Dropping)

504
00:16:58,200 --> 00:17:01,600
(A coin drops from Ji Hyo's bag.)

505
00:17:02,890 --> 00:17:05,260
(He picks it up quickly...)

506
00:17:05,260 --> 00:17:07,900
(and pays as if it was his.)

507
00:17:07,900 --> 00:17:09,510
(Thanks, Ji Hyo.)

508
00:17:11,100 --> 00:17:12,900
Why do I only have eight?

509
00:17:14,280 --> 00:17:16,020
Why do I only have eight?

510
00:17:17,050 --> 00:17:18,050
That's weird.

511
00:17:18,050 --> 00:17:20,260
(While Cavewoman Ji Hyo
is confused,)

512
00:17:20,790 --> 00:17:21,790
(Jae Suk returns disappointed.)

513
00:17:21,790 --> 00:17:22,790
This time...

514
00:17:24,030 --> 00:17:25,920
Your front teeth are protruded.

515
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:27,920
- He's dejected.
- Let's watch.

516
00:17:27,920 --> 00:17:29,260
He doesn't look happy.

517
00:17:29,770 --> 00:17:32,030
I'll tell you that
there aren't that many spots left.

518
00:17:32,030 --> 00:17:33,660
I believe that.

519
00:17:33,660 --> 00:17:35,960
Jong Kook,
I'll go and decide for myself.

520
00:17:35,960 --> 00:17:37,010
(Se Chan gets up.)

521
00:17:37,010 --> 00:17:38,960
- Our food is here. Let's eat first.
- What's that?

522
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:40,080
Let's eat.

523
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:43,040
(Current Number of Coins)

524
00:17:43,870 --> 00:17:46,350
There must be a mission about food.

525
00:17:47,020 --> 00:17:48,280
That's possible,

526
00:17:48,280 --> 00:17:49,520
but what could it be?

527
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:51,640
Shouldn't we just enjoy our food?

528
00:17:52,210 --> 00:17:53,850
Maybe you're not supposed to talk
with food on the table.

529
00:17:53,850 --> 00:17:55,990
That's possible.
No talking while eating.

530
00:17:55,990 --> 00:17:57,880
No, that's the wrong etiquette.

531
00:17:58,180 --> 00:18:01,230
You have to laugh while you eat
for good digestion.

532
00:18:01,230 --> 00:18:03,420
- We can enjoy our food, right?
- Thank you.

533
00:18:03,420 --> 00:18:04,460
(Let's worry about the mission
after the food.)

534
00:18:04,460 --> 00:18:07,360
- I want to go out so badly.
- This grilled hairtail is huge.

535
00:18:08,300 --> 00:18:09,840
It's so good.

536
00:18:10,040 --> 00:18:11,310
It's delicious.

537
00:18:11,310 --> 00:18:12,700
It's good.

538
00:18:12,700 --> 00:18:13,980
- This is delicious.
- It's good.

539
00:18:14,170 --> 00:18:16,430
- Thank you.
- It's amazing.

540
00:18:16,430 --> 00:18:17,700
It's good.

541
00:18:18,550 --> 00:18:19,670
It's good.

542
00:18:19,670 --> 00:18:21,820
(They forget about the mission
and gobble down the food.)

543
00:18:21,820 --> 00:18:23,080
This is good.

544
00:18:23,080 --> 00:18:24,440
It's delicious.

545
00:18:24,440 --> 00:18:27,560
- Didn't you order grilled fish?
- I know.

546
00:18:27,790 --> 00:18:30,330
Kwang Soo and I ordered
the braised fish.

547
00:18:30,330 --> 00:18:31,790
Let's share.

548
00:18:31,880 --> 00:18:32,990
Share?

549
00:18:32,990 --> 00:18:34,030
(He says "share"
when he steals other people's food.)

550
00:18:34,030 --> 00:18:36,150
What language was that?

551
00:18:36,150 --> 00:18:39,460
People who went already are
eating quietly.

552
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:41,360
I don't know about Jae Suk.

553
00:18:41,770 --> 00:18:44,600
- I'm curious. This drives me nuts.
- Me too.

554
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:46,740
I don't think I can digest my food.

555
00:18:47,010 --> 00:18:48,540
It makes me think.

556
00:18:48,540 --> 00:18:49,850
- Ask Ji Hyo.
- Should I go?

557
00:18:49,850 --> 00:18:51,780
Listen to her voice.
She sounds different.

558
00:18:53,410 --> 00:18:56,440
(Try this, Se Chan.)

559
00:18:56,440 --> 00:18:59,140
(He rejects her.)

560
00:18:59,710 --> 00:19:00,710
It's nothing.

561
00:19:01,020 --> 00:19:02,350
- I'm just giving it to you.
- I don't want it.

562
00:19:02,350 --> 00:19:03,830
It's not a mission.

563
00:19:03,830 --> 00:19:06,950
She gave me her yellow corvina.
What am I supposed to do?

564
00:19:06,950 --> 00:19:07,950
Do I need to eat it?

565
00:19:07,950 --> 00:19:09,920
(I thought something else
for a moment.)

566
00:19:10,500 --> 00:19:11,690
That was great.

567
00:19:11,690 --> 00:19:13,240
- I didn't eat from the bowl.
- I'll take it then.

568
00:19:13,240 --> 00:19:15,690
- That was good.
- That was delicious.

569
00:19:16,900 --> 00:19:19,310
(At that moment,
the producer comes up to the door.)

570
00:19:19,310 --> 00:19:20,600
The hairtail was good.

571
00:19:21,100 --> 00:19:23,780
(I see somebody moving.)

572
00:19:23,980 --> 00:19:26,100
Do you have any white radish left?
Can you give me one?

573
00:19:26,100 --> 00:19:28,370
(Jae Suk approaches the door
carefully.)

574
00:19:28,370 --> 00:19:30,790
Jae Suk, don't look too serious.

575
00:19:30,790 --> 00:19:32,520
- Come out, Jae Suk.
- Why?

576
00:19:35,260 --> 00:19:37,120
- He's calling you.
- You finished eating first.

577
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:39,330
- Why is he calling you?
- You put down your spoon first.

578
00:19:39,330 --> 00:19:40,800
He made eye contact
with the producer.

579
00:19:40,850 --> 00:19:42,920
Because we can't go out.

580
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:46,420
If the person in front of you is
still eating,

581
00:19:46,420 --> 00:19:48,390
- it's bad table manners to leave.
- You know what, Kwang Soo?

582
00:19:48,390 --> 00:19:49,600
He got up.

583
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:51,070
I understand up to two times.

584
00:19:51,070 --> 00:19:53,840
(There are many speculations
as Jae Suk leaves the room.)

585
00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:55,600
Why? I didn't do anything wrong
this time.

586
00:19:56,700 --> 00:19:58,100
- It's not me this time.
- Jae Suk.

587
00:19:58,100 --> 00:19:59,100
(Why did he call me?)

588
00:20:00,110 --> 00:20:03,380
(After a while)

589
00:20:03,940 --> 00:20:05,110
Can I have some more?

590
00:20:05,110 --> 00:20:06,380
Sure. The head?

591
00:20:06,380 --> 00:20:07,650
- He looks happy.
- My gosh.

592
00:20:07,650 --> 00:20:10,490
Jae Suk, you got up
when we didn't finish.

593
00:20:10,490 --> 00:20:11,920
(They think he lost more coins.)

594
00:20:12,530 --> 00:20:14,890
Come out, Suk Jin,

595
00:20:14,890 --> 00:20:16,000
- Sure.
- Why?

596
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,500
What's going on?

597
00:20:18,030 --> 00:20:19,620
Do you get more coins
if you go out early?

598
00:20:19,620 --> 00:20:20,840
I think so.

599
00:20:20,840 --> 00:20:22,100
I think you're right.

600
00:20:22,390 --> 00:20:25,040
(He walks to the producer
nervously.)

601
00:20:25,040 --> 00:20:26,200
- Suk Jin.
- Yes.

602
00:20:27,980 --> 00:20:32,870
(What happened to
Suk Jin and Jae Suk?)

603
00:20:32,870 --> 00:20:34,640
Maybe not.
I think something happened.

604
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:36,140
- I think these two are done.
- What is it?

605
00:20:36,140 --> 00:20:37,140
Who?

606
00:20:37,320 --> 00:20:38,850
Come out, Jong Kook.

607
00:20:38,850 --> 00:20:39,990
- Who?
- Who was that?

608
00:20:39,990 --> 00:20:41,560
- He called Jong Kook.
- Who was that?

609
00:20:41,560 --> 00:20:43,020
Jong Kook.

610
00:20:43,020 --> 00:20:44,490
That was so random.

611
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:47,000
- Me?
- What is it? The water?

612
00:20:47,060 --> 00:20:48,830
He didn't finish his food.

613
00:20:48,830 --> 00:20:50,620
- He didn't go out.
- What is it?

614
00:20:50,620 --> 00:20:51,620
(What could it be?)

615
00:20:51,620 --> 00:20:53,070
Are we not supposed to
have leftovers?

616
00:20:53,340 --> 00:20:54,460
I think so.

617
00:20:54,460 --> 00:20:57,130
(They can't tell
from these two's faces.)

618
00:20:58,100 --> 00:21:00,200
(He's very intrigued.)

619
00:21:00,200 --> 00:21:01,280
- Jong Kook.
- What is it? Yes.

620
00:21:01,340 --> 00:21:02,670
For a smooth resumption of filming,

621
00:21:02,670 --> 00:21:05,780
three people who finished eating
first will receive R coins.

622
00:21:05,940 --> 00:21:07,370
You got third place.

623
00:21:07,370 --> 00:21:09,140
(That's what it was.)

624
00:21:10,050 --> 00:21:12,790
(They were eating
just 5 minutes ago.)

625
00:21:12,790 --> 00:21:14,790
(He's done eating.)

626
00:21:15,610 --> 00:21:18,060
(His plate is clean.)

627
00:21:18,330 --> 00:21:20,260
(Jae Suk finished eating first.)

628
00:21:20,690 --> 00:21:21,730
(After Jae Suk,)

629
00:21:21,730 --> 00:21:23,770
(Suk Jin put down his spoon.)

630
00:21:24,730 --> 00:21:26,840
(Jong Kook was next.)

631
00:21:26,840 --> 00:21:29,160
(His plates are clean.)

632
00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:33,040
(They received 10 R coins each!)

633
00:21:34,980 --> 00:21:36,130
This is becoming...

634
00:21:36,200 --> 00:21:38,550
- What is it?
- Why? Did you lose some?

635
00:21:38,850 --> 00:21:39,980
What did he do again?

636
00:21:40,050 --> 00:21:41,440
He doesn't look happy.

637
00:21:41,780 --> 00:21:44,110
I know. He used his chopsticks
incorrectly.

638
00:21:44,490 --> 00:21:47,060
My chopstick skills are by the book.

639
00:21:47,060 --> 00:21:49,490
It's by the book. I'm so good.

640
00:21:49,490 --> 00:21:50,680
- You're actually good.
- Anyhow.

641
00:21:50,680 --> 00:21:52,120
I don't know what it is.

642
00:21:52,120 --> 00:21:53,230
Picky eaters.

643
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:54,730
Picky eaters?

644
00:21:54,730 --> 00:21:56,120
Was it people who were picky eaters?

645
00:21:56,920 --> 00:21:58,620
- I ate everything that was here.
- Me too.

646
00:21:59,620 --> 00:22:00,660
I did.

647
00:22:00,860 --> 00:22:03,430
I'm full.

648
00:22:03,430 --> 00:22:06,700
- I'm full.
- I'm full.

649
00:22:06,700 --> 00:22:07,810
I'm full too.

650
00:22:08,670 --> 00:22:10,140
I don't think this is it.

651
00:22:10,140 --> 00:22:11,640
- What is it?
- What is it?

652
00:22:12,670 --> 00:22:14,170
Look at his face.

653
00:22:14,170 --> 00:22:15,780
We can't help it.

654
00:22:15,780 --> 00:22:16,940
It has to do with coins.

655
00:22:16,940 --> 00:22:18,440
They look like people
who lost coins.

656
00:22:18,440 --> 00:22:19,940
Can we only go out if we get called?

657
00:22:19,940 --> 00:22:21,760
(Touching)

658
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:24,450
You ate as much as you wanted to.

659
00:22:24,450 --> 00:22:25,620
(Jae Suk, is this a sign?)

660
00:22:25,620 --> 00:22:27,100
He kicked him.

661
00:22:27,100 --> 00:22:29,330
(Of course, Kwang Soo.)

662
00:22:29,650 --> 00:22:32,390
You can't just go.

663
00:22:32,460 --> 00:22:34,630
How many times has he gone out?

664
00:22:35,500 --> 00:22:39,570
(He received Jae Suk's sign,
so he excitedly goes to the staff.)

665
00:22:39,570 --> 00:22:41,370
Why did you come?
Your name wasn't called.

666
00:22:41,870 --> 00:22:44,510
- Sorry?
- I didn't call you.

667
00:22:44,510 --> 00:22:45,750
Jae Suk sent me a sign.

668
00:22:46,140 --> 00:22:47,170
No?

669
00:22:47,170 --> 00:22:48,350
He tricked you.

670
00:22:52,350 --> 00:22:54,790
Jae Suk, he asked me why I came
when he didn't call me.

671
00:22:55,290 --> 00:22:57,260
Why did you send me a sign?

672
00:22:57,260 --> 00:22:58,330
It doesn't work that way.

673
00:22:58,330 --> 00:22:59,450
(It's fun making fun of Kwang Soo.)

674
00:22:59,450 --> 00:23:02,330
I know now.
You can't go even if you get called.

675
00:23:02,330 --> 00:23:04,030
We're not done eating.

676
00:23:04,030 --> 00:23:05,390
(That's not it.)

677
00:23:05,390 --> 00:23:06,390
I got goosebumps.

678
00:23:06,390 --> 00:23:08,190
Haha. Wasn't that observant?

679
00:23:08,190 --> 00:23:10,600
- I finished eating.
- The person next to you.

680
00:23:10,600 --> 00:23:12,270
- They're here.
- What?

681
00:23:12,270 --> 00:23:13,540
- What's going on?
- What's going on?

682
00:23:13,810 --> 00:23:15,870
- Is it over?
- It's over. It's done.

683
00:23:16,510 --> 00:23:17,750
Like Se Chan said.

684
00:23:17,750 --> 00:23:19,250
We weren't supposed to
go out, right?

685
00:23:19,250 --> 00:23:20,750
What am I supposed to do?

686
00:23:20,750 --> 00:23:23,680
You met up in this restaurant
and had breakfast...

687
00:23:23,680 --> 00:23:26,610
while the staff conducted
a hidden Game of Wits.

688
00:23:27,180 --> 00:23:28,380
The first mission was...

689
00:23:28,380 --> 00:23:30,290
to focus on your peers
during filming...

690
00:23:30,290 --> 00:23:32,030
and not to leave the room.

691
00:23:32,030 --> 00:23:34,260
People who left got coins deducted
according to the number of times.

692
00:23:34,830 --> 00:23:36,420
Kwang Soo must be broke.

693
00:23:36,420 --> 00:23:37,660
Did you pay?

694
00:23:37,660 --> 00:23:39,120
- But then...
- That's insane.

695
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:41,660
He said "this time," so I thought
it would be different next time.

696
00:23:41,660 --> 00:23:44,040
- Why did he do that?
- That's awful.

697
00:23:44,040 --> 00:23:45,900
- What was the 2nd one?
- The 2nd mission was...

698
00:23:46,010 --> 00:23:48,080
for a smooth resumption of filming,

699
00:23:48,080 --> 00:23:51,140
three people who finished
eating first...

700
00:23:51,140 --> 00:23:52,550
- All right!
- received R coins.

701
00:23:52,940 --> 00:23:54,020
(That's what it was.)

702
00:23:54,020 --> 00:23:55,050
People who finished eating first?

703
00:23:55,050 --> 00:23:58,790
There were also people who finished
late and delayed filming.

704
00:23:58,790 --> 00:24:01,350
So Min and Ji Hyo
will have to pay five coins each.

705
00:24:01,350 --> 00:24:03,560
(So Min and Ji Hyo have to pay
5 coins each.)

706
00:24:03,560 --> 00:24:04,830
They were slow.

707
00:24:05,150 --> 00:24:07,850
(While the staff was coming in,)

708
00:24:07,850 --> 00:24:10,920
(Ji Hyo and So Min were
still eating.)

709
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:12,920
Why did you eat so slowly?

710
00:24:13,390 --> 00:24:14,860
I always eat slow.

711
00:24:14,860 --> 00:24:17,400
- I eat slow.
- They were nibbling on their food.

712
00:24:17,400 --> 00:24:20,510
There were hints in this room
regarding the missions.

713
00:24:20,510 --> 00:24:21,580
- Here?
- Where?

714
00:24:21,580 --> 00:24:23,900
There were inside napkins
and so on, but we'll tell you later.

715
00:24:23,900 --> 00:24:25,640
- We used all the napkins.
- Really?

716
00:24:25,640 --> 00:24:27,020
I have the napkins.

717
00:24:27,020 --> 00:24:28,820
Why do you have them?

718
00:24:28,820 --> 00:24:29,910
There's something written here.

719
00:24:29,910 --> 00:24:30,990
What does it say?

720
00:24:30,990 --> 00:24:34,410
"Within this hour,
it's more beneficial for you..."

721
00:24:34,410 --> 00:24:35,710
- "if other members leave."
- I see it.

722
00:24:35,710 --> 00:24:36,760
Is it written on it?

723
00:24:36,760 --> 00:24:38,590
- They printed this on the napkins?
- Nobody looked.

724
00:24:38,590 --> 00:24:41,920
- You should've shared these.
- Seriously?

725
00:24:41,920 --> 00:24:44,160
I took them
because I have a runny nose.

726
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:47,130
(Haha was first to arrive.)

727
00:24:47,130 --> 00:24:48,660
Gosh, I'm starving.
Why is this here?

728
00:24:48,660 --> 00:24:50,070
(Why is this here?)

729
00:24:50,070 --> 00:24:51,960
(He pushed away the napkins
that contained clues.)

730
00:24:52,460 --> 00:24:55,240
(Ji Hyo took the napkins
that Haha pushed away.)

731
00:24:55,600 --> 00:24:57,310
(She wiped her nose with the clues.)

732
00:24:58,200 --> 00:25:00,820
(Then she kept them all to herself.)

733
00:25:01,710 --> 00:25:03,590
- But...
- We need to inspect our pockets.

734
00:25:03,590 --> 00:25:04,680
- The napkins...
- She took them all.

735
00:25:04,680 --> 00:25:05,680
She stashed them for herself.

736
00:25:05,680 --> 00:25:07,150
We should check
our pockets from now on.

737
00:25:07,150 --> 00:25:08,680
- The napkins...
- On the napkins?

738
00:25:08,680 --> 00:25:11,350
- Unbelievable.
- Just like you experienced,

739
00:25:11,350 --> 00:25:13,690
you will be rewarded today
depending on how witty you are.

740
00:25:13,690 --> 00:25:16,030
The race is called
Hey, You Can Find Out Too!

741
00:25:16,030 --> 00:25:18,070
The missions will pop up randomly.

742
00:25:18,120 --> 00:25:22,770
Depending on your actions,
you will either lose or gain coins.

743
00:25:22,800 --> 00:25:25,570
The two with
the most amount of coins...

744
00:25:25,570 --> 00:25:27,580
will be given a chance
to pick an ungraded prize.

745
00:25:27,580 --> 00:25:29,280
An upgraded prize?

746
00:25:29,510 --> 00:25:32,050
You'll now change outfits
and then head to the next location.

747
00:25:32,050 --> 00:25:33,610
- Got it.
- Sure thing.

748
00:25:34,440 --> 00:25:35,670
Let's get on the bus.

749
00:25:36,050 --> 00:25:37,410
- Understand?
- Many were tested.

750
00:25:37,410 --> 00:25:38,790
- Yes.
- What a twist.

751
00:25:38,790 --> 00:25:40,290
- Hold on.
- Don't you agree?

752
00:25:40,290 --> 00:25:41,950
What's this?

753
00:25:41,950 --> 00:25:44,030
(Who's waiting for the members?)

754
00:25:44,030 --> 00:25:47,620
(Assistant Director Son
is holding up his hand.)

755
00:25:47,620 --> 00:25:49,420
(What would you do if you saw him?)

756
00:25:49,420 --> 00:25:51,500
(His hands have been sanitized.)

757
00:25:52,360 --> 00:25:53,530
(Kwang Soo runs forward...)

758
00:25:53,530 --> 00:25:55,340
(and slaps his hand.)

759
00:25:56,600 --> 00:25:57,840
- Wait.
- What's this?

760
00:25:57,840 --> 00:25:59,240
I think we need to high-five him.

761
00:26:00,010 --> 00:26:01,630
(Slap)

762
00:26:01,900 --> 00:26:03,670
I think we need to high-five him.

763
00:26:03,980 --> 00:26:05,140
I walked right past him.

764
00:26:05,140 --> 00:26:07,640
- I was first.
- I was third.

765
00:26:07,640 --> 00:26:09,370
(Whatever the mission is...)

766
00:26:09,370 --> 00:26:10,610
I was second.

767
00:26:10,610 --> 00:26:11,610
(Does the order matter?)

768
00:26:11,610 --> 00:26:13,140
I was second.

769
00:26:13,520 --> 00:26:14,760
(Suk Jin also slaps his hand.)

770
00:26:14,760 --> 00:26:16,290
Just get on the bus.

771
00:26:16,710 --> 00:26:18,120
(Hyun Hee gives him a hug.)

772
00:26:18,120 --> 00:26:19,380
(Goodness)

773
00:26:19,380 --> 00:26:20,390
Wait, what now?

774
00:26:20,390 --> 00:26:21,530
(Peck)

775
00:26:21,920 --> 00:26:24,390
(Hyun Hee slaps his hand
after doing everything else.)

776
00:26:25,800 --> 00:26:28,390
(Ji Min gives him a hug
but doesn't slap his hand.)

777
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:30,810
Shouldn't we bump his hand
with our elbow?

778
00:26:30,930 --> 00:26:32,130
- Really?
- Of course not.

779
00:26:33,130 --> 00:26:35,430
(So Min lets out scissors.)

780
00:26:35,430 --> 00:26:37,580
(It could be a game
of rock-paper-scissors.)

781
00:26:38,350 --> 00:26:39,350
Just get on the bus.

782
00:26:39,400 --> 00:26:40,910
(She then slaps his hand.)

783
00:26:40,910 --> 00:26:42,110
(And then she hugs him.)

784
00:26:42,110 --> 00:26:43,320
Have you been here all this time?

785
00:26:43,320 --> 00:26:45,210
This seems like
another hidden mission.

786
00:26:45,210 --> 00:26:47,790
Everything feels like a mission.

787
00:26:48,910 --> 00:26:50,110
I swear!

788
00:26:50,110 --> 00:26:51,120
(Was he in the Boy Scouts?)

789
00:26:52,230 --> 00:26:53,230
Okay.

790
00:26:53,420 --> 00:26:56,190
Please buckle in.
Actually, this bus seems new.

791
00:26:56,600 --> 00:26:58,030
(What was the mission?)

792
00:26:58,030 --> 00:26:59,890
I think I was able to get it right.

793
00:27:00,430 --> 00:27:01,840
I think he's about to tell us.

794
00:27:01,840 --> 00:27:04,160
- The high-five...
- Is that what we should've done?

795
00:27:04,160 --> 00:27:05,240
No, you shouldn't have.

796
00:27:05,240 --> 00:27:07,510
- I was first.
- You see...

797
00:27:07,510 --> 00:27:10,580
Let me reveal the result
of the third Game of Wits.

798
00:27:10,580 --> 00:27:11,810
- Was there another one?
- We shouldn't have done anything.

799
00:27:11,810 --> 00:27:14,910
Some of you high-fived
Assistant Director Son.

800
00:27:14,910 --> 00:27:16,410
- That's right.
- I wasn't going to,

801
00:27:16,410 --> 00:27:17,710
but Kwang Soo
made me question my decision.

802
00:27:17,710 --> 00:27:19,710
- It could be a good thing.
- I shouldn't have.

803
00:27:19,710 --> 00:27:23,920
Ji Min, Jong Kook,
and Ji Hyo didn't slap his hand.

804
00:27:23,920 --> 00:27:24,920
(Ji Min, Jong Kook, and Ji Hyo
didn't high-five him.)

805
00:27:24,920 --> 00:27:27,330
We value how you didn't
kiss up to the staff...

806
00:27:27,330 --> 00:27:28,830
and that wins you two R coins each.

807
00:27:28,830 --> 00:27:30,420
- What?
- Nice!

808
00:27:30,420 --> 00:27:31,690
Okay!

809
00:27:31,690 --> 00:27:32,770
Are you kidding me?

810
00:27:32,770 --> 00:27:34,860
How is a high-five
considered as kissing up to someone?

811
00:27:34,860 --> 00:27:36,040
(He can't believe it.)

812
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:39,570
(Kwang Soo ran over
even with his injured leg.)

813
00:27:40,980 --> 00:27:44,870
(The other 7 members
kissed up to the staff.)

814
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:48,910
We're friends,
so a high-five meant nothing!

815
00:27:48,910 --> 00:27:50,750
I can't believe
you'd put it that way.

816
00:27:50,750 --> 00:27:52,820
We didn't give him a high-five
to kiss up to him.

817
00:27:52,820 --> 00:27:55,020
I only high-fived him
so that he wouldn't feel awkward.

818
00:27:55,020 --> 00:27:56,590
So everything
is linked to a mission.

819
00:27:56,590 --> 00:28:00,120
You can't keep punishing those
who are willing to take action.

820
00:28:00,120 --> 00:28:02,030
I hate how you put it
as "kissing up" to him.

821
00:28:02,030 --> 00:28:03,530
- Exactly.
- That's hardly the case.

822
00:28:03,530 --> 00:28:05,300
- He's right.
- Besides,

823
00:28:05,300 --> 00:28:07,340
why would we kiss up to Soo Yong?

824
00:28:07,340 --> 00:28:09,630
- Tell me about it.
- Why would we?

825
00:28:09,960 --> 00:28:12,600
(He suffers a loss for some reason.)

826
00:28:12,860 --> 00:28:15,170
Anyway, you shouldn't do anything
that has nothing to do...

827
00:28:15,170 --> 00:28:16,510
with the show.

828
00:28:16,600 --> 00:28:18,550
- Okay.
- I hope we get going.

829
00:28:18,550 --> 00:28:19,810
Let's go!

830
00:28:19,810 --> 00:28:21,110
(Let's go!)

831
00:28:21,110 --> 00:28:22,520
- There's more.
- We commend...

832
00:28:22,520 --> 00:28:25,210
Se Chan's active participation
of yelling "Let's go"...

833
00:28:25,210 --> 00:28:27,180
and reward him with five R coins.

834
00:28:27,180 --> 00:28:29,610
(Se Chan receives 5 R coins.)

835
00:28:30,420 --> 00:28:32,060
- What on earth?
- Let's go!

836
00:28:32,060 --> 00:28:33,330
Nice!

837
00:28:33,330 --> 00:28:34,620
- Are you kidding me?
- Five coins?

838
00:28:34,620 --> 00:28:36,530
- Five coins?
- This is too random!

839
00:28:36,530 --> 00:28:38,530
- Let's go.
- Let's begin filming!

840
00:28:38,530 --> 00:28:40,390
- You're too late.
- We're already filming,

841
00:28:40,390 --> 00:28:42,070
- so why would you say that?
- We're already filming.

842
00:28:42,070 --> 00:28:44,130
Sir, please drive safely.

843
00:28:44,130 --> 00:28:45,400
That's you kissing up to him.

844
00:28:45,400 --> 00:28:46,430
The director is...

845
00:28:46,430 --> 00:28:48,310
giving out random missions
whenever he feels like it.

846
00:28:48,310 --> 00:28:49,670
- That's not the case.
- The rules are set.

847
00:28:49,670 --> 00:28:52,440
We already set the rules
and have filmed that separately.

848
00:28:52,900 --> 00:28:54,320
They're not random.

849
00:28:54,320 --> 00:28:56,780
There's no way
he'd do things on the fly.

850
00:28:56,780 --> 00:28:58,750
- Unbelievable.
- Be wittier, Kwang Soo.

851
00:28:58,750 --> 00:29:00,650
- My gosh.
- So now...

852
00:29:00,650 --> 00:29:03,320
Se Chan, for some reason,
you look like a sardine today.

853
00:29:03,320 --> 00:29:05,120
A sardine? What's that?

854
00:29:05,120 --> 00:29:06,330
- Don't you know what it is?
- Isn't that bait?

855
00:29:06,330 --> 00:29:07,760
- Sardines.
- The kind that you pickle?

856
00:29:07,760 --> 00:29:10,330
Don't you know what is it?
It's the fish you feed dolphins.

857
00:29:10,330 --> 00:29:11,860
- As bait.
- Bait?

858
00:29:11,860 --> 00:29:13,030
No, it's food.

859
00:29:13,030 --> 00:29:16,100
- It's bait used to catch big fish.
- Yes, it's used as bait.

860
00:29:16,130 --> 00:29:17,810
But still...

861
00:29:17,810 --> 00:29:20,240
(He suddenly bursts into laughter.)

862
00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:22,240
- What's going on?
- I'm actively reacting.

863
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:23,700
I doubt that's one of the missions.

864
00:29:23,700 --> 00:29:26,400
You never know. It could've been.

865
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:27,780
(He desperately tries
to win R coins.)

866
00:29:27,780 --> 00:29:29,780
You never know, right?

867
00:29:30,210 --> 00:29:32,320
Gosh, what a bummer.

868
00:29:32,790 --> 00:29:33,820
My gosh.

869
00:29:34,490 --> 00:29:36,110
I'd like to receive some R coins.

870
00:29:36,110 --> 00:29:37,730
There's no way to know
what the missions are.

871
00:29:37,730 --> 00:29:40,120
- I'm completely broke.
- I don't have many either.

872
00:29:40,120 --> 00:29:41,420
Ji Hyo, are you broke?

873
00:29:41,420 --> 00:29:42,690
Yes.

874
00:29:42,690 --> 00:29:44,070
Then forfeit the game.

875
00:29:44,070 --> 00:29:46,460
Jae Suk, don't be ridiculous.

876
00:29:46,500 --> 00:29:47,740
Unbelievable.

877
00:29:47,800 --> 00:29:48,800
You guys...

878
00:29:48,800 --> 00:29:51,860
Look at you all
trying to win R coins.

879
00:29:52,660 --> 00:29:54,930
What I said made sure...

880
00:29:54,930 --> 00:29:57,940
that Ji Hyo and I
didn't get edited out.

881
00:29:58,050 --> 00:30:00,550
Also, did you check out my reaction?

882
00:30:00,550 --> 00:30:02,910
- Isn't that worth R coins?
- You did well.

883
00:30:02,910 --> 00:30:04,550
- There you go.
- He commended you.

884
00:30:04,550 --> 00:30:06,210
- Congratulations.
- Just a compliment?

885
00:30:06,210 --> 00:30:08,590
- Good job.
- It's as if he's teasing us.

886
00:30:08,590 --> 00:30:11,530
How do we get him
to pay us R coins?

887
00:30:11,530 --> 00:30:14,620
- Why would you put it like that?
- We're not in Sangam-dong yet.

888
00:30:14,690 --> 00:30:16,920
We're going somewhere else.
Something must be up.

889
00:30:17,060 --> 00:30:18,300
Get ready for the next mission.

890
00:30:18,300 --> 00:30:20,390
Sir, we're not in Sangam-dong!

891
00:30:20,390 --> 00:30:21,960
You're going the wrong way.

892
00:30:21,960 --> 00:30:23,800
- Unbelievable.
- I know what it is.

893
00:30:23,800 --> 00:30:25,660
We're taking the wrong path.

894
00:30:25,660 --> 00:30:26,860
Let's not be silly.

895
00:30:26,860 --> 00:30:28,400
- What was that?
- What did you say?

896
00:30:28,400 --> 00:30:29,700
- Wasn't that it?
- Kwang Soo...

897
00:30:29,700 --> 00:30:31,140
You sounded like
a translation device.

898
00:30:31,140 --> 00:30:32,440
I'll drive!

899
00:30:32,440 --> 00:30:34,580
- We're all taking action.
- I'll drive.

900
00:30:34,580 --> 00:30:36,780
It's all right, sir.
Drive as safely as you want.

901
00:30:36,780 --> 00:30:38,750
(They've never been
this proactive before.)

902
00:30:38,750 --> 00:30:41,020
- It's all right.
- It's all right.

903
00:30:41,020 --> 00:30:42,820
- Go, sir!
- It's all right.

904
00:30:42,820 --> 00:30:44,490
- This is great.
- Everyone makes mistakes.

905
00:30:44,530 --> 00:30:47,150
Why don't we sing songs
just like we do on picnics?

906
00:30:48,030 --> 00:30:51,570
(In the spring breeze)

907
00:30:51,570 --> 00:30:55,540
(They sing along in hopes
of winning R coins.)

908
00:30:56,460 --> 00:30:58,070
(Jong Kook is most proactive.)

909
00:30:58,860 --> 00:31:01,130
(The R Coin Effect)

910
00:31:01,130 --> 00:31:03,980
- It is spring for sure.
- It's nice to be with you all.

911
00:31:03,980 --> 00:31:05,550
Can we hear Yu San Seul's song?

912
00:31:05,550 --> 00:31:06,640
(Hyun Hee makes a request.)

913
00:31:07,100 --> 00:31:08,910
(All of it)

914
00:31:08,910 --> 00:31:09,940
- Hold on.
<i>- Just redevelop it</i>

915
00:31:09,940 --> 00:31:12,490
I bet this isn't
just for the R coins.

916
00:31:12,490 --> 00:31:14,520
(The R coins bring out
their party DNA.)

917
00:31:14,520 --> 00:31:16,110
Any more requests?

918
00:31:16,110 --> 00:31:19,330
We're all doing our best
to earn a few coins.

919
00:31:19,330 --> 00:31:21,920
I mean, just take
a look at Jong Kook!

920
00:31:21,920 --> 00:31:24,300
- He's on a roll.
- What's gotten into him?

921
00:31:24,300 --> 00:31:28,540
(The R Coin Effect continues.)

922
00:31:30,070 --> 00:31:31,400
- What's next?
<i>- I'm happier</i>

923
00:31:31,400 --> 00:31:33,040
(He was furious about being told
that he kissed up to someone.)

924
00:31:33,840 --> 00:31:36,040
Suk Jin makes it sound
like an oldie though.

925
00:31:36,040 --> 00:31:37,080
(Suk Jin makes it sound
like an oldie though.)

926
00:31:38,510 --> 00:31:39,900
(You're mine, ha!)

927
00:31:39,900 --> 00:31:42,170
- Gosh.
- It sounds so old-fashioned.

928
00:31:42,170 --> 00:31:44,550
I love it when songs
are changed up that way.

929
00:31:44,590 --> 00:31:47,020
We'll soon arrive at
the broadcasting station.

930
00:31:47,320 --> 00:31:48,710
We're almost there.

931
00:31:48,710 --> 00:31:50,020
Where are we heading then?

932
00:31:50,020 --> 00:31:51,650
- So we're almost there.
- We have arrived!

933
00:31:51,650 --> 00:31:54,920
You will get off the bus
with the person you trust the most.

934
00:31:56,030 --> 00:31:57,230
- Please team up.
- A team of two?

935
00:31:57,230 --> 00:31:59,230
- Yes, a team of two.
- So Min,

936
00:31:59,230 --> 00:32:00,800
Kwang Soo, and...

937
00:32:00,800 --> 00:32:03,040
- Jae Suk too.
- Yes, him.

938
00:32:03,040 --> 00:32:05,700
- You included.
- As you know, I'm trustworthy.

939
00:32:05,700 --> 00:32:07,840
Ji Min, how would
you describe yourself?

940
00:32:07,840 --> 00:32:09,810
I'm quite witty.

941
00:32:09,930 --> 00:32:11,750
- Then I choose Ji Min.
- Sure.

942
00:32:11,940 --> 00:32:13,750
How about we team up?

943
00:32:13,750 --> 00:32:15,710
- Jong Kook, what do you say?
- Ji Min and I.

944
00:32:15,710 --> 00:32:18,590
- I'd love to team up with Se Chan.
- I choose Jong Kook too.

945
00:32:18,590 --> 00:32:20,020
Of course,
I'd choose my comfort doll.

946
00:32:20,020 --> 00:32:21,650
I'll team up with whoever wants me.

947
00:32:21,650 --> 00:32:22,790
- And I...
- Me!

948
00:32:22,790 --> 00:32:23,950
I...

949
00:32:23,950 --> 00:32:25,120
- Kwang Soo...
- I promise.

950
00:32:25,120 --> 00:32:26,850
- Should I take it back?
- You'll be with Kwang Soo?

951
00:32:26,850 --> 00:32:27,850
Yes, Kwang Soo.

952
00:32:27,850 --> 00:32:28,850
Gosh, I'm grateful.

953
00:32:28,850 --> 00:32:29,850
I'm teaming up with Ji Min.

954
00:32:29,850 --> 00:32:31,390
- Suk Jin, you and me?
- Sure thing.

955
00:32:31,420 --> 00:32:32,730
I'll team up with Ji Hyo.

956
00:32:32,730 --> 00:32:34,270
- I...
- Who else?

957
00:32:34,300 --> 00:32:36,930
Your name hasn't come up yet,
so stay put.

958
00:32:36,930 --> 00:32:38,770
- Jae Suk...
- Jae Suk,

959
00:32:38,770 --> 00:32:40,810
I'll team up with you
for one R coin.

960
00:32:40,810 --> 00:32:42,980
I have no intention of doing that.

961
00:32:42,980 --> 00:32:43,980
Let's hurry then.

962
00:32:43,980 --> 00:32:45,750
Jong Kook and Se Chan
can leave first.

963
00:32:45,750 --> 00:32:47,750
All right.
Get ready for Kook and Chan.

964
00:32:47,750 --> 00:32:49,210
Kook and Chan, here we come!

965
00:32:49,210 --> 00:32:51,180
(What mission awaits them?)

966
00:32:51,180 --> 00:32:52,850
Kook and Chan!

967
00:32:52,850 --> 00:32:54,490
(SBS Prism Tower, Sangam-dong)

968
00:32:54,490 --> 00:32:57,210
They're filming from a distance,
so let's say hello.

969
00:32:57,210 --> 00:32:58,790
- Hello.
- Hi.

970
00:32:59,030 --> 00:33:02,300
<i>- Among the flowers
- Among the flowers</i>

971
00:33:02,300 --> 00:33:05,070
(Their energy runs too high
because of today's mission.)

972
00:33:05,070 --> 00:33:06,800
There's another camera
filming from afar.

973
00:33:06,800 --> 00:33:08,600
I wonder what they have
in store for us.

974
00:33:08,600 --> 00:33:10,070
- I'm curious.
- I'm excited.

975
00:33:10,070 --> 00:33:11,600
- My heart's pounding.
- Mine too.

976
00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:13,340
(Kook and Chan
couldn't be more excited.)

977
00:33:13,340 --> 00:33:14,600
I wonder what game
we'll be playing.

978
00:33:14,600 --> 00:33:17,670
- I'd love to get to work.
- Where are we headed?

979
00:33:17,670 --> 00:33:19,050
I can't wait to start filming.

980
00:33:19,850 --> 00:33:21,050
I can't wait.

981
00:33:21,110 --> 00:33:22,210
Third floor. Here we are.

982
00:33:22,210 --> 00:33:25,550
- Where are we supposed to go?
- This way. What now?

983
00:33:25,790 --> 00:33:28,590
- We need to start filming already.
- I know.

984
00:33:28,590 --> 00:33:30,490
I wonder what's going on.
Don't forget the hand sanitizer.

985
00:33:30,490 --> 00:33:32,760
- Once more?
- Of course.

986
00:33:32,760 --> 00:33:33,850
(Is using the hand sanitizer
their mission?)

987
00:33:34,390 --> 00:33:36,390
- Does it work?
- Yes, a lot comes out.

988
00:33:36,830 --> 00:33:38,360
Okay. Let's go.

989
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:40,620
- Se Chan.
- What is it?

990
00:33:40,620 --> 00:33:42,930
- I see R coins.
- What?

991
00:33:42,930 --> 00:33:46,040
(R coins are dropped on the floor.)

992
00:33:47,070 --> 00:33:48,840
- Didn't you see it?
- I didn't.

993
00:33:49,810 --> 00:33:51,850
- This...
- Hold on.

994
00:33:51,940 --> 00:33:54,410
(This must be a mission!)

995
00:33:54,410 --> 00:33:56,210
- Se Chan.
- I didn't see it.

996
00:33:56,580 --> 00:34:00,020
Are we supposed to split these?
Say we're filming.

997
00:34:00,020 --> 00:34:02,560
These are props
used by our show only.

998
00:34:02,560 --> 00:34:04,560
- Let's say someone dropped them.
- Right.

999
00:34:04,560 --> 00:34:05,790
- So taking them...
- Okay.

1000
00:34:05,790 --> 00:34:07,030
would be a bad move.

1001
00:34:07,380 --> 00:34:08,420
- Still...
- Yes?

1002
00:34:08,420 --> 00:34:10,330
They could be here...

1003
00:34:10,420 --> 00:34:12,500
for us to take though.

1004
00:34:13,030 --> 00:34:15,230
As a reward for paying attention?

1005
00:34:15,230 --> 00:34:17,330
There is more than one coin, right?

1006
00:34:17,330 --> 00:34:19,060
So if we split them...

1007
00:34:19,730 --> 00:34:20,830
- No, wait.
- We shouldn't take them?

1008
00:34:20,830 --> 00:34:22,400
To me,

1009
00:34:22,440 --> 00:34:23,580
these look like...

1010
00:34:24,350 --> 00:34:25,940
they were dropped.

1011
00:34:25,940 --> 00:34:27,000
Someone dropped them by mistake?

1012
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:28,610
It doesn't say anywhere
that we should take them.

1013
00:34:28,610 --> 00:34:30,150
- Right.
- We shouldn't do anything...

1014
00:34:30,150 --> 00:34:31,580
that the staff
doesn't want us to do.

1015
00:34:31,580 --> 00:34:32,690
You're right.

1016
00:34:33,020 --> 00:34:34,920
- What do you say?
- You're right today.

1017
00:34:34,920 --> 00:34:37,110
What Director Choi...

1018
00:34:37,110 --> 00:34:38,380
doesn't tell us to do...

1019
00:34:38,380 --> 00:34:39,880
Why are you brimming
with energy today?

1020
00:34:39,920 --> 00:34:41,900
- We shouldn't take them.
- Right.

1021
00:34:41,900 --> 00:34:43,920
We came here to shoot,
and they said, "Please go up."

1022
00:34:43,920 --> 00:34:45,560
So we came up here. Wait.

1023
00:34:45,730 --> 00:34:48,190
There are coins on the floor.
Is there anything written here?

1024
00:34:48,190 --> 00:34:51,000
Did our producer leave a note? No.

1025
00:34:51,060 --> 00:34:52,940
- Should we just go?
- We should leave them here.

1026
00:34:52,940 --> 00:34:54,310
- Okay.
- Let's go.

1027
00:34:54,310 --> 00:34:55,730
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

1028
00:34:55,830 --> 00:34:59,270
I think you got it perfectly right.

1029
00:34:59,810 --> 00:35:01,480
All right.

1030
00:35:01,480 --> 00:35:03,250
- Here come good citizens.
- Yes.

1031
00:35:03,250 --> 00:35:05,790
- Only do what you're told to do.
- We're good citizens.

1032
00:35:05,880 --> 00:35:07,650
- Jong Kook to the Assembly!
- Yes!

1033
00:35:07,790 --> 00:35:09,210
Don't stab me in the back.

1034
00:35:09,360 --> 00:35:10,690
No way.

1035
00:35:11,060 --> 00:35:12,420
Don't stab me in the back,
seriously.

1036
00:35:13,060 --> 00:35:14,290
You can't stab me in the back,

1037
00:35:14,290 --> 00:35:15,900
but I can stab you in the back,
so be careful.

1038
00:35:16,020 --> 00:35:17,730
You know I'm smart, right?

1039
00:35:19,060 --> 00:35:20,190
Right?

1040
00:35:20,190 --> 00:35:22,040
I'm pretty smart.

1041
00:35:22,040 --> 00:35:23,860
Don't even think of
stabbing me in the back.

1042
00:35:24,040 --> 00:35:25,960
(Welcome)

1043
00:35:25,960 --> 00:35:27,770
- These days...
- What's that?

1044
00:35:28,270 --> 00:35:29,440
- What is it?
- Oh, my.

1045
00:35:29,440 --> 00:35:30,880
(Whatever it is, I'll pick it up.)

1046
00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:32,350
- What's that?
- Unbelievable.

1047
00:35:33,150 --> 00:35:34,210
What's that?

1048
00:35:34,940 --> 00:35:36,150
I can't believe this.

1049
00:35:36,650 --> 00:35:38,750
(Suk Jin sounds excited.)

1050
00:35:39,750 --> 00:35:41,710
We're not supposed to take it,
are we?

1051
00:35:43,110 --> 00:35:45,290
- We should just leave it here.
- Right?

1052
00:35:46,460 --> 00:35:47,900
You shouldn't take something
that doesn't belong to you.

1053
00:35:47,900 --> 00:35:49,600
- I shouldn't...
- It doesn't belong to you.

1054
00:35:49,600 --> 00:35:51,520
- I don't think I should take this.
- No.

1055
00:35:51,670 --> 00:35:52,690
Right?

1056
00:35:53,730 --> 00:35:55,770
I don't believe in...

1057
00:35:56,330 --> 00:35:57,960
- unexpected good luck.
- But...

1058
00:35:58,460 --> 00:36:00,630
I don't know what to do.

1059
00:36:00,630 --> 00:36:02,110
I'm slow-witted.

1060
00:36:02,110 --> 00:36:04,040
I hate these things.

1061
00:36:04,710 --> 00:36:06,440
It bothers me.

1062
00:36:06,540 --> 00:36:08,610
- There are 30 coins.
- Gosh.

1063
00:36:08,610 --> 00:36:10,080
With these,
you'll move up to the first place.

1064
00:36:10,850 --> 00:36:12,040
- Let's split them 50-50.
- Okay.

1065
00:36:12,040 --> 00:36:13,190
It's no big deal
if they take them away.

1066
00:36:13,540 --> 00:36:15,110
(They fail to let go of
their greed.)

1067
00:36:15,110 --> 00:36:16,420
- Hi.
- Hi.

1068
00:36:17,210 --> 00:36:19,880
Did you take something
that isn't yours or not?

1069
00:36:20,080 --> 00:36:22,560
- Who says it's not ours?
- Who knows if it's just good luck?

1070
00:36:22,650 --> 00:36:24,790
Who knows if it's
unexpected good luck?

1071
00:36:26,270 --> 00:36:27,860
The staff...

1072
00:36:27,860 --> 00:36:29,630
- never told us to take them.
- It shows your personality.

1073
00:36:29,830 --> 00:36:31,560
We should trust each other.

1074
00:36:31,560 --> 00:36:33,500
Why would we not trust each other?

1075
00:36:33,500 --> 00:36:35,810
- Right? Always trust each other.
- Definitely.

1076
00:36:37,580 --> 00:36:38,610
Can I...

1077
00:36:38,610 --> 00:36:39,610
(Haha steps on the coins.)

1078
00:36:40,110 --> 00:36:42,540
(Haha finally notices the coins.)

1079
00:36:45,520 --> 00:36:49,110
Gosh, that's bad luck.
You dropped your coins?

1080
00:36:49,110 --> 00:36:50,560
(Ji Min thinks
Haha dropped his coins.)

1081
00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:52,920
Gosh, why did I drop them?

1082
00:36:53,230 --> 00:36:54,360
What happened?

1083
00:36:54,790 --> 00:36:56,230
(Smiling)

1084
00:36:56,860 --> 00:36:58,060
(Haha pretends
the coins belong to him.)

1085
00:36:58,060 --> 00:36:59,500
You and... Who is it?

1086
00:37:00,100 --> 00:37:01,670
- Ji Min? What did you do?
- What did you do?

1087
00:37:01,670 --> 00:37:02,690
- What do you mean?
- What did you do?

1088
00:37:02,690 --> 00:37:03,790
Did you find anything on the floor?

1089
00:37:03,790 --> 00:37:05,860
(Be quiet.)

1090
00:37:05,860 --> 00:37:06,860
- Did you find them?
- What did you do?

1091
00:37:06,860 --> 00:37:08,270
- We know you did.
- We know you did.

1092
00:37:08,270 --> 00:37:09,900
We all found them.

1093
00:37:09,900 --> 00:37:11,380
Ji Min, did you pick anything up
from the floor?

1094
00:37:11,380 --> 00:37:12,400
Did you pick?

1095
00:37:13,040 --> 00:37:14,250
- I didn't...
- What happened?

1096
00:37:15,420 --> 00:37:17,310
(What happened between these two?)

1097
00:37:17,480 --> 00:37:19,710
You took them
without telling Ji Min?

1098
00:37:19,850 --> 00:37:21,460
I thought they dropped
from your bag.

1099
00:37:21,460 --> 00:37:22,610
They did.

1100
00:37:22,960 --> 00:37:25,580
- Gosh.
- Unbelievable.

1101
00:37:25,580 --> 00:37:27,750
- You're so mean.
- I...

1102
00:37:27,750 --> 00:37:29,400
- They dropped from my bag.
- We're supposed to take them.

1103
00:37:29,400 --> 00:37:30,860
They told us to team up
with a trustworthy person.

1104
00:37:30,860 --> 00:37:32,960
- We're supposed to take them.
- That makes sense.

1105
00:37:32,960 --> 00:37:34,770
- Even if you pick them up first...
- Even if you pick them up first...

1106
00:37:36,100 --> 00:37:37,670
I mean...

1107
00:37:37,770 --> 00:37:39,330
They dropped from my bag.

1108
00:37:39,330 --> 00:37:40,440
(Ji Min is betrayed
by her partner..)

1109
00:37:40,810 --> 00:37:42,110
- Trust me.
- Hey.

1110
00:37:42,110 --> 00:37:43,670
So Min, you have to trust me today.

1111
00:37:43,670 --> 00:37:44,710
- We have to trust each other.
- Okay.

1112
00:37:44,710 --> 00:37:46,810
- Wait. What is that?
- What is that?

1113
00:37:47,540 --> 00:37:48,610
Well...

1114
00:37:49,310 --> 00:37:50,750
I guess they're for us.

1115
00:37:50,850 --> 00:37:52,080
- They're for us?
- Yes.

1116
00:37:52,080 --> 00:37:53,580
We're probably doing something
with these.

1117
00:37:54,690 --> 00:37:55,790
It's a test.

1118
00:37:56,080 --> 00:37:57,460
Let's return them to the staff.

1119
00:37:57,460 --> 00:37:58,750
They were on the floor.

1120
00:37:58,750 --> 00:38:01,150
- They don't belong to us.
- We should return them.

1121
00:38:01,520 --> 00:38:02,830
- Let's find out who they belong to.
- We should do the right thing.

1122
00:38:02,830 --> 00:38:04,520
We want to find out
who these belong to.

1123
00:38:04,520 --> 00:38:05,520
(They look for the owner
of the coins in the empty hallway.)

1124
00:38:06,190 --> 00:38:07,790
- Why is no one answering?
- But there are so many.

1125
00:38:07,790 --> 00:38:08,900
Should we take just one?

1126
00:38:08,900 --> 00:38:10,230
Hey, you shouldn't do this.

1127
00:38:10,230 --> 00:38:12,000
They won't even be able to tell.
Let's just take one each.

1128
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:13,440
Hey, we shouldn't do this.

1129
00:38:13,440 --> 00:38:14,540
- There are so many.
- No way.

1130
00:38:14,540 --> 00:38:16,480
- You're being ridiculous.
- You don't have so many coins.

1131
00:38:16,480 --> 00:38:18,770
- How many do you have?
- Still, we shouldn't take these.

1132
00:38:18,770 --> 00:38:20,210
I know that, but...

1133
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:21,980
- no one will know if we take one.
- We can't.

1134
00:38:21,980 --> 00:38:23,710
You're being dishonest.

1135
00:38:23,710 --> 00:38:24,790
It won't even show.

1136
00:38:24,790 --> 00:38:25,850
What are you talking about?

1137
00:38:25,850 --> 00:38:27,020
Let's just count how many there are.

1138
00:38:27,250 --> 00:38:28,310
I knew it.

1139
00:38:28,310 --> 00:38:29,810
- Let's just count them.
- You want to take them, don't you?

1140
00:38:29,960 --> 00:38:32,250
- You want to. Be honest.
- I'm just counting them.

1141
00:38:32,460 --> 00:38:33,880
So Min is persuading Ji Hyo.

1142
00:38:34,060 --> 00:38:35,150
She's persuading Ji Hyo.

1143
00:38:35,150 --> 00:38:36,900
Ji Hyo is getting sneaky
these days too.

1144
00:38:37,290 --> 00:38:39,270
- Don't take anything secretly.
- I won't.

1145
00:38:39,270 --> 00:38:40,420
Don't take anything.

1146
00:38:40,420 --> 00:38:42,730
I'm good at these tests.

1147
00:38:42,730 --> 00:38:44,770
I never cheat on tests.

1148
00:38:44,770 --> 00:38:46,940
We just found them on the floor.

1149
00:38:47,710 --> 00:38:48,830
They don't belong to us.

1150
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:50,500
We should go in here.

1151
00:38:51,080 --> 00:38:52,880
- They're finally here.
- Those two...

1152
00:38:53,480 --> 00:38:55,710
We decided to return these
to the staff.

1153
00:38:55,710 --> 00:38:57,480
- Yes, we're returning them.
- We just picked them up.

1154
00:38:57,480 --> 00:38:58,710
We're returning these.

1155
00:38:58,710 --> 00:39:01,210
- You're returning them?
- Yes, we'd like to return them.

1156
00:39:01,790 --> 00:39:04,210
(The last pair appears.)

1157
00:39:04,210 --> 00:39:05,290
Why is no one here?

1158
00:39:05,480 --> 00:39:08,020
For this game,
we have to trust each other.

1159
00:39:08,020 --> 00:39:09,750
- We should rely on each other...
- Exactly.

1160
00:39:09,750 --> 00:39:11,000
and help each other out.

1161
00:39:14,460 --> 00:39:17,770
(As soon as he sees the coins,)

1162
00:39:17,770 --> 00:39:19,770
(he picks them up and runs away.)

1163
00:39:20,330 --> 00:39:23,810
(Until 3 seconds ago,
they were talking about trust.)

1164
00:39:24,330 --> 00:39:26,000
We should trust...

1165
00:39:27,250 --> 00:39:28,920
Give them to me.

1166
00:39:28,920 --> 00:39:31,440
(When Hyun Hee picked Kwang Soo,
everyone expected this to happen.)

1167
00:39:32,310 --> 00:39:33,790
- Wait.
- It's started.

1168
00:39:34,190 --> 00:39:35,210
Seriously.

1169
00:39:35,210 --> 00:39:37,310
- He took everything?
- Is this a comedy show?

1170
00:39:37,360 --> 00:39:38,960
- He took everything.
- Give them to me.

1171
00:39:38,960 --> 00:39:41,230
(Kwang Soo loses control again.)

1172
00:39:41,230 --> 00:39:42,290
Did you two fight?

1173
00:39:42,290 --> 00:39:44,600
- Yes, a little.
- Did you pick those up?

1174
00:39:44,600 --> 00:39:46,020
You said we're a team.

1175
00:39:46,020 --> 00:39:47,190
We are.

1176
00:39:47,330 --> 00:39:48,440
What's going on?

1177
00:39:48,440 --> 00:39:50,060
- On your way here,
- Yes.

1178
00:39:50,060 --> 00:39:52,110
- did you all see the coins?
- Yes.

1179
00:39:52,210 --> 00:39:53,500
This mission was about...

1180
00:39:54,060 --> 00:39:57,210
sharing happiness together
without suspecting each other.

1181
00:39:57,270 --> 00:39:59,250
- Okay.
- You can keep the coins.

1182
00:39:59,980 --> 00:40:02,250
- Okay!
- Okay!

1183
00:40:02,250 --> 00:40:03,270
The one who took the coins...

1184
00:40:03,270 --> 00:40:04,610
- "Okay"?
- Don't worry.

1185
00:40:04,880 --> 00:40:06,710
What are you talking about?
Give them to me right now.

1186
00:40:06,710 --> 00:40:07,750
Seriously, don't worry.

1187
00:40:07,750 --> 00:40:08,880
I mean...

1188
00:40:09,020 --> 00:40:10,750
If you pick up something
on the street,

1189
00:40:10,750 --> 00:40:13,130
you're supposed to return it
to its owner.

1190
00:40:13,130 --> 00:40:16,190
We returned them to you.
Shouldn't we get at least one?

1191
00:40:16,190 --> 00:40:17,900
You're too nice.

1192
00:40:18,020 --> 00:40:20,130
At least show me.
I didn't even see them.

1193
00:40:21,270 --> 00:40:22,860
At least show me.

1194
00:40:23,100 --> 00:40:26,110
I'm glad I didn't pick
Kwang Soo or Haha.

1195
00:40:26,360 --> 00:40:28,230
Gosh, we're a team.

1196
00:40:28,230 --> 00:40:29,900
(Hyun Hee and Kwang Soo
finish the game...)

1197
00:40:29,900 --> 00:40:32,000
(looking silly.)

1198
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:33,040
Should I carry them for you?

1199
00:40:33,040 --> 00:40:35,610
You can win more R coins
in this mission.

1200
00:40:35,770 --> 00:40:37,810
- It's called Break the Basket.
- What's that?

1201
00:40:38,020 --> 00:40:40,080
The winning team can win R coins...

1202
00:40:40,150 --> 00:40:43,360
from the box of wits.

1203
00:40:44,360 --> 00:40:45,920
One member of each team...

1204
00:40:45,920 --> 00:40:47,630
will sit under the team's basket.

1205
00:40:47,830 --> 00:40:51,000
Two members of each team will put on
gloves and put a gym ball...

1206
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:52,060
under their shirts
and deliver bean pouches...

1207
00:40:52,060 --> 00:40:53,100
to the members under the baskets.

1208
00:40:53,130 --> 00:40:56,560
They can push others outside
the lines with their bellies.

1209
00:40:56,670 --> 00:41:00,540
When you're pushed out,
you have to pause for 10 seconds.

1210
00:41:00,560 --> 00:41:02,400
Each basket contains
100 ping pong balls,

1211
00:41:02,400 --> 00:41:03,900
which will be exchanged with coins.

1212
00:41:03,980 --> 00:41:06,270
The number of the ping pong balls
you catch from the basket...

1213
00:41:06,270 --> 00:41:10,650
plus 25 will be the number of coins
you can receive.

1214
00:41:10,650 --> 00:41:11,940
Divide into teams.

1215
00:41:11,940 --> 00:41:13,250
(They divide into teams.)

1216
00:41:13,580 --> 00:41:15,360
(Team White: Ji Min, Jae Suk,
Haha, So Min, and Se Chan)

1217
00:41:15,360 --> 00:41:17,060
(Team Blue: Hyun Hee, Suk Jin,
Jong Kook, Ji Hyo, and Kwang Soo)

1218
00:41:17,080 --> 00:41:19,690
Are you allowed to punch others?

1219
00:41:19,690 --> 00:41:20,960
He's intimidating us.

1220
00:41:21,500 --> 00:41:22,650
(Do you have a problem?)

1221
00:41:22,650 --> 00:41:23,960
He's glaring at us.

1222
00:41:23,960 --> 00:41:25,960
Se Chan, you can beat Jong Kook.

1223
00:41:26,690 --> 00:41:28,440
(He has no chance.)

1224
00:41:28,440 --> 00:41:29,540
I like it.

1225
00:41:30,190 --> 00:41:32,170
- Go!
- Let's start.

1226
00:41:32,170 --> 00:41:33,610
- Let's do this!
- Let's do this!

1227
00:41:33,630 --> 00:41:34,940
- You can do this!
- Ready.

1228
00:41:34,940 --> 00:41:36,130
- You can do this!
- Knock him down.

1229
00:41:36,900 --> 00:41:38,150
They're targeting you.

1230
00:41:39,900 --> 00:41:40,940
They're targeting you.

1231
00:41:41,110 --> 00:41:43,170
(Jong Kook pushes 2 people at once.)

1232
00:41:44,170 --> 00:41:45,540
Push Suk Jin!

1233
00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:47,350
- What are you doing?
- What's going on?

1234
00:41:47,710 --> 00:41:49,060
Get the bean pouches!

1235
00:41:49,060 --> 00:41:50,460
(Se Chan tries to deliver
bean pouches to Haha.)

1236
00:41:50,710 --> 00:41:52,580
(He gets blocked by Jong Kook.)

1237
00:41:52,580 --> 00:41:53,920
Get the bean pouches!

1238
00:41:55,290 --> 00:41:56,560
I can't pick them up.

1239
00:41:56,560 --> 00:41:57,750
(All you have to do is
toss bean pouches.)

1240
00:41:57,750 --> 00:41:58,860
(But it turns into wrestling.)

1241
00:41:58,860 --> 00:42:00,790
Wait. I have to toss it like this?

1242
00:42:00,790 --> 00:42:02,830
- Like this?
- Hurry up.

1243
00:42:03,360 --> 00:42:05,110
- Suk Jin, bring me bean pouches!
- No!

1244
00:42:05,110 --> 00:42:06,460
Jong Kook has to defend.

1245
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:08,770
Why can't I pick them up?

1246
00:42:09,040 --> 00:42:10,230
Suk Jin!

1247
00:42:10,230 --> 00:42:11,940
Either defend
or bring me bean pouches!

1248
00:42:12,110 --> 00:42:13,770
- Come on!
- Push him out!

1249
00:42:13,770 --> 00:42:14,770
- Hey!
- He's out.

1250
00:42:14,770 --> 00:42:16,210
(He gets pushed out
without doing anything.)

1251
00:42:17,150 --> 00:42:18,520
- Suk Jin is out!
- Now!

1252
00:42:18,520 --> 00:42:19,580
(Frustrated)

1253
00:42:20,110 --> 00:42:21,880
Goodness, Suk Jin!

1254
00:42:22,520 --> 00:42:24,860
Why are you on our team?

1255
00:42:24,980 --> 00:42:27,330
(In the end, Jong Kook uses force.)

1256
00:42:27,330 --> 00:42:29,400
Se Chan is out.
Let's finish him off.

1257
00:42:29,750 --> 00:42:31,920
(With Suk Jin out, Jong Kook
successfully delivers bean pouches.)

1258
00:42:32,960 --> 00:42:35,360
Aim higher, Kwang Soo!

1259
00:42:35,790 --> 00:42:36,860
(He misses the basket.)

1260
00:42:37,190 --> 00:42:40,000
(Team Jong Kook's hope
is thrown away.)

1261
00:42:40,330 --> 00:42:42,310
(Kwang Soo turns out to be
a bigger problem than Suk Jin.)

1262
00:42:42,310 --> 00:42:43,380
I figured it out.

1263
00:42:43,500 --> 00:42:45,880
(Even though Haha doesn't have
many bean pouches,)

1264
00:42:45,880 --> 00:42:47,580
(he hits the basket every time.)

1265
00:42:48,110 --> 00:42:49,540
- Hang in there!
- Haha.

1266
00:42:49,540 --> 00:42:50,750
You're almost there.

1267
00:42:51,440 --> 00:42:52,540
(All his 3 bean pouches
hit the basket.)

1268
00:42:52,610 --> 00:42:54,480
You're almost there. Keep going.

1269
00:42:55,650 --> 00:42:57,690
- It's starting to break.
- It's breaking.

1270
00:42:59,130 --> 00:43:02,100
(The basket finally breaks.)

1271
00:43:02,100 --> 00:43:05,860
(His team can win as many coins
as the ping pong balls he catches.)

1272
00:43:05,860 --> 00:43:08,400
(How many ping pong balls
will Haha catch?)

1273
00:43:08,400 --> 00:43:09,460
- Gosh.
- Oh, no.

1274
00:43:12,730 --> 00:43:14,710
- Okay!
- Haha!

1275
00:43:15,710 --> 00:43:17,500
- What did you do?
- You should have caught them.

1276
00:43:17,730 --> 00:43:19,210
- How many did you catch?
- You should have caught them!

1277
00:43:19,210 --> 00:43:20,670
What did you do?

1278
00:43:20,670 --> 00:43:21,920
What's with you?

1279
00:43:22,150 --> 00:43:23,810
I mean...

1280
00:43:23,810 --> 00:43:25,150
I was so focused
on breaking the basket.

1281
00:43:25,650 --> 00:43:28,650
The losing team also has
a chance to win coins.

1282
00:43:28,690 --> 00:43:29,790
What's that?

1283
00:43:30,520 --> 00:43:32,420
- What's that?
- Is it like drawing lots?

1284
00:43:32,420 --> 00:43:33,580
We get to select a number.

1285
00:43:33,580 --> 00:43:34,650
(6 boxes of wits are brought in.)

1286
00:43:34,860 --> 00:43:37,150
- "Take coins from the other team"?
- Yes!

1287
00:43:37,420 --> 00:43:39,130
The rules are simple.

1288
00:43:39,600 --> 00:43:43,400
The losing team will distribute
the balls the winning team caught...

1289
00:43:43,400 --> 00:43:47,270
among the six boxes of wits
in secret.

1290
00:43:47,270 --> 00:43:49,610
Each member of the winning team
will choose a box...

1291
00:43:49,610 --> 00:43:51,380
and get to keep the coins
in the box.

1292
00:43:51,380 --> 00:43:53,000
The coins in the remaining box
will go to the losing team.

1293
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:54,110
Okay.

1294
00:43:54,580 --> 00:43:56,310
There are 31 ping pong balls
in total.

1295
00:43:56,310 --> 00:43:58,380
The losing team will distribute them
now. Please turn around.

1296
00:43:58,380 --> 00:44:00,290
- Okay.
- Turn around. Go away.

1297
00:44:00,790 --> 00:44:02,790
Put at least one ball in each box.

1298
00:44:03,060 --> 00:44:05,380
- Put 1 ball in each box first.
- Put 1 in each.

1299
00:44:05,380 --> 00:44:06,580
Put one in each.

1300
00:44:07,250 --> 00:44:08,750
- Do it quietly.
- You can't hear anything.

1301
00:44:09,020 --> 00:44:10,560
- Suk Jin, I'd like to ask a favor.
- Keep calm.

1302
00:44:10,560 --> 00:44:12,230
- Please don't say anything.
- Right.

1303
00:44:12,360 --> 00:44:13,960
- Don't even touch the balls.
- I can't say anything?

1304
00:44:13,960 --> 00:44:15,130
I can't say anything?

1305
00:44:15,230 --> 00:44:16,460
- Don't say anything.
- When they choose boxes,

1306
00:44:16,460 --> 00:44:17,670
can you step out for a moment?

1307
00:44:18,210 --> 00:44:19,960
- Please.
- I can't do that.

1308
00:44:20,040 --> 00:44:21,810
How about putting all of them
in one box?

1309
00:44:21,810 --> 00:44:23,500
- Seriously?
- In one box?

1310
00:44:23,500 --> 00:44:24,850
- Should we...
- Or in two boxes?

1311
00:44:25,040 --> 00:44:26,310
- Let's put them in two boxes.
- That'd be better.

1312
00:44:26,380 --> 00:44:27,440
Or one?

1313
00:44:27,440 --> 00:44:28,940
(How will the losing team distribute
the ping pong balls?)

1314
00:44:29,150 --> 00:44:30,650
You didn't put all of them
in one box, did you?

1315
00:44:30,940 --> 00:44:32,650
- What?
- We can't tell you.

1316
00:44:32,650 --> 00:44:34,150
- I think they did.
- You put all of them in one box?

1317
00:44:34,150 --> 00:44:36,920
- Each box has at least one ball.
- I know.

1318
00:44:36,920 --> 00:44:39,250
- The rest would be in one box.
- Exactly.

1319
00:44:39,250 --> 00:44:41,500
- We didn't discriminate.
- One box has all the balls.

1320
00:44:41,600 --> 00:44:43,690
If you look inside, you will suffer
dismemberment.

1321
00:44:43,690 --> 00:44:45,630
- Let me... What?
- What? Dismemberment?

1322
00:44:45,630 --> 00:44:47,330
Do you even know
what dismemberment means?

1323
00:44:47,330 --> 00:44:49,170
Isn't it some kind of harassment?

1324
00:44:49,170 --> 00:44:50,170
(He has no idea.)

1325
00:44:50,360 --> 00:44:52,060
- It involves cutting off the limbs.
- It involves cutting off the limbs.

1326
00:44:52,060 --> 00:44:53,900
- Is it that bad?
- Yes.

1327
00:44:53,900 --> 00:44:55,940
- I was so startled.
- Your limbs get pulled off.

1328
00:44:55,940 --> 00:44:57,630
It was a punishment for treason
back in the days.

1329
00:44:57,630 --> 00:44:59,650
I lack the vocabulary.

1330
00:44:59,750 --> 00:45:00,810
I choose...

1331
00:45:01,270 --> 00:45:02,350
number two.

1332
00:45:02,350 --> 00:45:04,020
Number two. Please pick a box each.

1333
00:45:04,310 --> 00:45:06,040
I need to figure out
what they are thinking.

1334
00:45:06,040 --> 00:45:07,190
I bet...

1335
00:45:07,420 --> 00:45:09,020
Jong Kook made the decision.

1336
00:45:09,020 --> 00:45:10,020
(He pretends to be sharp.)

1337
00:45:10,020 --> 00:45:12,480
I bet the four of them
blindly followed his decision.

1338
00:45:12,480 --> 00:45:14,860
How did you know?
Did you take a peek?

1339
00:45:15,060 --> 00:45:17,100
- All right.
- Did you hear us talk?

1340
00:45:17,100 --> 00:45:18,500
All right. I choose number five.

1341
00:45:18,500 --> 00:45:20,730
(Jae Suk chooses number 5.)

1342
00:45:20,730 --> 00:45:22,690
- Haha.
- Number four.

1343
00:45:22,690 --> 00:45:24,040
(Haha chooses number 4.)

1344
00:45:24,040 --> 00:45:25,610
I choose number six.

1345
00:45:25,610 --> 00:45:27,170
Number 6? Then you are number 1.

1346
00:45:27,170 --> 00:45:28,480
I don't have a choice.

1347
00:45:28,480 --> 00:45:30,540
- Open the boxes from number one.
- Shall we do that?

1348
00:45:30,540 --> 00:45:32,000
- Number one.
- Yes.

1349
00:45:32,440 --> 00:45:33,610
1, 2, 3.

1350
00:45:34,810 --> 00:45:35,880
(How many balls are inside?)

1351
00:45:35,880 --> 00:45:36,940
How many balls are there?

1352
00:45:36,940 --> 00:45:38,020
There are a lot.

1353
00:45:39,350 --> 00:45:40,350
How many balls are there?

1354
00:45:40,350 --> 00:45:41,960
(Full of balls)

1355
00:45:42,060 --> 00:45:43,520
- Are there many?
- 5, 6, 7, 8,

1356
00:45:43,520 --> 00:45:44,790
- 9, 10, 11.
- There are many.

1357
00:45:44,790 --> 00:45:45,860
They put all the balls in there.

1358
00:45:45,860 --> 00:45:47,480
Yes. They put all the balls
in there.

1359
00:45:48,020 --> 00:45:49,330
- Number 2.
- Number 2.

1360
00:45:49,330 --> 00:45:50,860
(Se Chan chose number 2.)

1361
00:45:50,860 --> 00:45:52,920
(He opens the box!)

1362
00:45:53,920 --> 00:45:55,270
There is one.

1363
00:46:23,080 --> 00:46:26,290
(Jae Suk opens box number 5!)

1364
00:46:28,310 --> 00:46:30,020
(It's a jackpot.)

1365
00:46:32,830 --> 00:46:34,690
- There are a lot.
- Number five has a lot.

1366
00:46:34,690 --> 00:46:35,890
- How many balls are there?
- In my box?

1367
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:38,100
5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10,

1368
00:46:38,100 --> 00:46:40,190
- 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16.
- There are a lot.

1369
00:46:40,190 --> 00:46:41,790
- 15, 16.
- We will check.

1370
00:46:41,790 --> 00:46:43,100
You got a lot of balls.

1371
00:46:43,790 --> 00:46:45,190
- I got 1 ball.
- Shall we open number 3?

1372
00:46:45,190 --> 00:46:46,270
Number 3 has 1 ball.

1373
00:46:46,270 --> 00:46:48,640
(1 ball that was in box number 3
goes to the other team.)

1374
00:46:48,640 --> 00:46:50,080
Okay.

1375
00:46:50,140 --> 00:46:51,410
We should have put the balls
in different boxes.

1376
00:46:52,180 --> 00:46:54,080
I suggested the boxes in the middle.

1377
00:46:54,310 --> 00:46:56,480
I told you that we should choose
boxes number 3 and 4.

1378
00:46:56,480 --> 00:46:57,850
Why didn't they choose
the middle one?

1379
00:46:57,850 --> 00:46:59,410
Who will take the ball
in box number three?

1380
00:47:00,690 --> 00:47:02,250
(Kwang Soo's arm is
in box number 3.)

1381
00:47:02,250 --> 00:47:03,810
Kwang Soo is taking the ball.

1382
00:47:04,210 --> 00:47:05,460
Suk Jin should have it.

1383
00:47:06,020 --> 00:47:07,560
(What is Ji Hyo doing?)

1384
00:47:08,330 --> 00:47:09,600
The ball in box number three
is ours, right?

1385
00:47:09,600 --> 00:47:11,060
It's yours.

1386
00:47:11,100 --> 00:47:12,190
Where did it go?

1387
00:47:12,190 --> 00:47:14,120
- Ji Hyo has it.
- Here. Play rock-paper-scissors.

1388
00:47:14,120 --> 00:47:15,290
Let's play rock-paper-scissors.

1389
00:47:15,290 --> 00:47:17,230
- Who doesn't have a ball?
- Just take it. It's only one.

1390
00:47:17,230 --> 00:47:18,640
- Okay.
- What are you doing?

1391
00:47:18,640 --> 00:47:19,870
Change it.

1392
00:47:20,440 --> 00:47:21,770
He is asking the staff
to change it to an R coin.

1393
00:47:21,770 --> 00:47:22,980
Ji Hyo.

1394
00:47:23,270 --> 00:47:26,600
I am sorry,
but he already made the exchange.

1395
00:47:26,600 --> 00:47:28,080
- What? When?
- I am sorry.

1396
00:47:28,080 --> 00:47:29,580
I am sorry,

1397
00:47:29,580 --> 00:47:31,180
but Ji Hyo stole my ball.

1398
00:47:32,020 --> 00:47:33,040
(Me?)

1399
00:47:33,040 --> 00:47:35,560
She put her hand inside

1400
00:47:35,560 --> 00:47:36,850
Is it yours?

1401
00:47:36,850 --> 00:47:38,210
Did Kwang Soo take the ball?

1402
00:47:38,460 --> 00:47:41,930
Ji Hyo must have thought
it was ours.

1403
00:47:42,290 --> 00:47:43,520
This is mine.

1404
00:47:43,520 --> 00:47:45,060
Give me the R coin.

1405
00:47:45,100 --> 00:47:47,190
How could you allow this?

1406
00:47:47,190 --> 00:47:48,690
- Didn't you give her the ball?
- Why would I do that?

1407
00:47:48,690 --> 00:47:50,600
She took my ball.

1408
00:47:50,600 --> 00:47:51,770
Would it be okay if I take
other people's ball?

1409
00:47:51,770 --> 00:47:52,960
Put it back.

1410
00:47:54,160 --> 00:47:55,940
Jae Suk must be in the first place.

1411
00:47:56,270 --> 00:47:57,540
I am not in the first place yet.

1412
00:47:57,540 --> 00:47:58,600
Race of Wits. One.

1414
00:48:01,710 --> 00:48:02,910
Three.

1415
00:48:02,910 --> 00:48:04,770
The 2 of you should pay up
2 coins each.

1416
00:48:05,210 --> 00:48:07,350
What is your problem?

1417
00:48:07,520 --> 00:48:10,190
Are you keep going to stress us out
this way?

1418
00:48:10,190 --> 00:48:11,810
Why did you yell "Two"?

1419
00:48:11,960 --> 00:48:13,560
Why did you?

1420
00:48:13,660 --> 00:48:15,460
I wanted to win coins.

1421
00:48:15,460 --> 00:48:17,430
- I did it without thinking.
- I wanted to win coins.

1422
00:48:17,430 --> 00:48:19,270
- Let's play it one more time.
- Does it count...

1423
00:48:19,270 --> 00:48:20,270
as a game?

1424
00:48:20,270 --> 00:48:22,190
- I am annoyed it's in the script.
- I know.

1425
00:48:22,190 --> 00:48:23,290
Is it really in the script?

1426
00:48:24,160 --> 00:48:27,140
We will now play a game
that is popular...

1427
00:48:27,140 --> 00:48:28,730
among university students.

1428
00:48:29,310 --> 00:48:30,640
It's the Projector Game.

1429
00:48:30,640 --> 00:48:31,640
What is that?

1430
00:48:31,640 --> 00:48:32,710
You make the shape
of the projector...

1431
00:48:32,710 --> 00:48:35,100
- with your arms first.
- Okay.

1432
00:48:35,180 --> 00:48:36,540
Then you pick a person.

1433
00:48:36,540 --> 00:48:39,140
"Jae Suk, 'The Face Reader'."
Then in five seconds,

1434
00:48:39,140 --> 00:48:41,580
Jae Suk needs to say a line
or act out a scene.

1435
00:48:41,580 --> 00:48:43,850
- "Do I have the face of a king?"
- That's right.

Why did you start the game
with "E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial"?

1447
00:49:05,850 --> 00:49:07,080

- Seriously.

- It's an ancient movie.

1450

I gave him the hard one.

1451
00:49:11,910 --> 00:49:13,980
"E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial"

"RoboCop" came out ages ago.

1544
00:52:20,560 --> 00:52:21,560
Let's keep going.

1545
00:52:21,560 --> 00:52:24,600
<i>- Projector

1546
00:52:24,710 --> 00:52:27,350
Suk Jin, "Riverbank Legends".

1547
00:52:27,370 --> 00:52:28,440
What?

1548
00:52:28,770 --> 00:52:32,580
"I went to great lengths
to build this riverbank."

1549
00:52:32,710 --> 00:52:33,940
- Suk Jin.
- It's "Riverbank Legends".

1550
00:52:33,940 --> 00:52:35,690
- It's not that kind of a movie.
- It's "Riverbank Legends".

1551
00:52:35,690 --> 00:52:37,580
"Legends", not "Construction".

1552
00:52:37,580 --> 00:52:39,160
- "Riverbank Legends".
- "Riverbank Legends".

1553
00:52:39,520 --> 00:52:41,020
"Legends", not "Construction".

1554
00:52:41,250 --> 00:52:43,160
- My goodness.
- Construction.

1555
00:52:43,730 --> 00:52:45,600
I have never heard of the movie.

1556
00:52:45,600 --> 00:52:47,790
- I almost cried.
- Suk Jin.

1558
00:52:50,940 --> 00:52:53,830
Suk Jin, "A T. Rex Claw".

1559
00:52:54,310 --> 00:52:56,480
(It's a comedy movie
Suk Jin starred in as an extra...)

1560
00:52:56,480 --> 00:52:58,810
(about dinosaurs and primitive men.)

1561
00:53:01,040 --> 00:53:03,120
- There is no such scene.
- Suk Jin, that's wrong.

1562
00:53:03,120 --> 00:53:04,870
- There is no such scene.
- You played a primitive man.

1563
00:53:04,870 --> 00:53:07,390
- Hold on.
- You played a dead man.

1564
00:53:07,390 --> 00:53:08,480
Suk Jin. Hold on.

1565
00:53:08,480 --> 00:53:09,710
There is no such scene.

1566
00:53:09,710 --> 00:53:11,120
What? I am imitating a dinosaur.

1567
00:53:13,060 --> 00:53:14,930
I played the 16th primitive man.

1568
00:53:15,190 --> 00:53:16,850
(He's imitating
one of these characters.)

1569
00:53:17,830 --> 00:53:19,460
- Okay.
- There are dinosaurs.

Se Chan, "Ratatouille."

1572
00:53:22,560 --> 00:53:23,560
"Ratatouille"?

1573
00:53:23,560 --> 00:53:25,560
"Rata, Rata, Ratatouille!"

1574
00:53:25,560 --> 00:53:26,710
Nice job.

1575
00:53:26,710 --> 00:53:28,660
(He makes one up.)

1576
00:53:29,330 --> 00:53:31,310
- What? "Rata, Rata,"
- That's not it.

1577
00:53:31,310 --> 00:53:33,140
"Ratatouille!" What's wrong?

1578
00:53:33,140 --> 00:53:35,580
- That's not it.
- It did come out!

1579
00:53:35,580 --> 00:53:36,680
Check the movie!

1580
00:53:36,680 --> 00:53:38,180
- The 44-minute mark!
- No.

1581
00:53:38,180 --> 00:53:40,620
"Rata..." No one knows.

1582
00:53:40,620 --> 00:53:42,790
- That didn't come out.
- "Rata, Rata, Ratatouille!"

1583
00:53:42,790 --> 00:53:44,120
- That's wrong.
- "Rata, Rata..."

1584
00:53:44,120 --> 00:53:47,480
- But...
- It's a movie about cooking.

1585
00:53:47,480 --> 00:53:49,250
It's about a mouse that cooks.

1586
00:53:49,290 --> 00:53:50,690
- I see.
- That's what it's about.

1587
00:53:50,690 --> 00:53:52,500
- He's so cute.
- Let's wrap it up.

1588
00:53:52,500 --> 00:53:54,690
Suk Jin's construction skit
was hilarious.

1589
00:53:54,690 --> 00:53:55,730
One.

1590
00:53:56,690 --> 00:53:58,270
- 1.
- 2.

1591
00:53:58,270 --> 00:54:00,370
(Suddenly, another game is played.)

1592
00:54:01,330 --> 00:54:02,370
Two.

1593
00:54:02,910 --> 00:54:03,910
- 3!
- 4.

1594
00:54:03,910 --> 00:54:04,910
Five.

1595
00:54:04,910 --> 00:54:07,810
- This was a game of 3, 6, 9.
- What?

1596
00:54:07,810 --> 00:54:09,370
- What?
- It was a game of 3, 6, 9.

1597
00:54:09,370 --> 00:54:10,410
(It wasn't a Race of Wits?)

1598
00:54:10,410 --> 00:54:12,040
- Really?
- That was round two.

1599
00:54:12,040 --> 00:54:13,350
(Loser of 3, 6, 9 loses 2 coins.)

1600
00:54:13,350 --> 00:54:14,850
- This is hilarious.
- I like how...

1601
00:54:14,850 --> 00:54:16,560
- that was sudden.
- That was funny.

1602
00:54:16,560 --> 00:54:18,790
- That was hilarious.
- Goodness.

1603
00:54:18,910 --> 00:54:21,120
- That was humiliating.
- I wrote it down.

1604
00:54:21,120 --> 00:54:22,660
This is interesting.

1605
00:54:23,020 --> 00:54:24,620
- Give it to me.
- How dare you humiliate me?

1606
00:54:25,390 --> 00:54:26,870
- How many coins?
- Two.

1607
00:54:26,870 --> 00:54:29,270
- Poor thing.
- He just had to say three.

1608
00:54:29,270 --> 00:54:31,000
- I thought it was a Race of Wits.
- Poor him.

1609
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:33,270
I'll announce the results.

1610
00:54:33,370 --> 00:54:34,370
Okay.

1611
00:54:34,370 --> 00:54:37,100
The couple that lost the most
will be able to hide theirs in here.

1612
00:54:37,100 --> 00:54:39,040
It was Jae Suk and Suk Jin.

1613
00:54:39,040 --> 00:54:40,100
(They will hide the coins.)

1614
00:54:40,100 --> 00:54:41,310
- It's us?
- Yes.

1615
00:54:41,310 --> 00:54:43,120
- You two will hide...
- Gosh.

1616
00:54:43,120 --> 00:54:46,390
all 66 coins,
and the rest will pick.

1617
00:54:46,390 --> 00:54:47,390
- There are 66 coins?
- Yes.

1618
00:54:47,390 --> 00:54:49,290
- Goodness.
- We could win.

1619
00:54:49,290 --> 00:54:50,850
- Let's turn the tables.
- "Turn the tables"?

1620
00:54:50,850 --> 00:54:53,830
- Let's put in one each.
- Okay.

1621
00:54:53,830 --> 00:54:56,190
You're good with things like this.
You should do it.

1622
00:54:56,190 --> 00:54:57,290
(They come up with a plan.)

1623
00:54:57,290 --> 00:54:58,730
- Hold on.
- I put them in.

1624
00:54:59,500 --> 00:55:00,870
Let's not divide them.

1625
00:55:01,190 --> 00:55:03,100
- Let's put them all in one box.
- Okay.

1626
00:55:03,660 --> 00:55:05,370
How about the middle one?

1627
00:55:05,660 --> 00:55:06,870
Weren't they in here before?

1628
00:55:07,310 --> 00:55:08,910
We shouldn't put them in there.

1629
00:55:09,410 --> 00:55:10,680
How about here?

1630
00:55:10,680 --> 00:55:12,040
(They're in a dilemma
between number 3 and 4.)

1631
00:55:12,040 --> 00:55:13,640
- Let's put it in here.
- Okay.

1632
00:55:13,640 --> 00:55:15,710
- All right.
- I don't care anymore.

1633
00:55:15,710 --> 00:55:16,870
(They pick number 4.)

1634
00:55:17,250 --> 00:55:18,250
I don't care anymore.

1635
00:55:19,640 --> 00:55:21,020
Please turn around.

1636
00:55:21,710 --> 00:55:23,080
- So Min.
- Turn around.

1637
00:55:23,080 --> 00:55:24,850
- Turn around.
- Okay.

1638
00:55:24,850 --> 00:55:26,930
- We're putting them in right now.
- We are.

1639
00:55:27,580 --> 00:55:30,100
(If they're smart,
they can obtain all the coins.)

1640
00:55:30,100 --> 00:55:33,290
(Which box will they pick?)

1641
00:55:33,290 --> 00:55:34,520
Gather, please.

1642
00:55:35,100 --> 00:55:36,370
Let's go.

1643
00:55:38,140 --> 00:55:39,730
We need to pick the right one.

1644
00:55:40,140 --> 00:55:43,830
The couple with the most money
will go first.

1645
00:55:43,830 --> 00:55:45,850
Haha and Ji Min will go first.

1646
00:55:45,910 --> 00:55:47,040
Pick.

1647
00:55:48,600 --> 00:55:49,620
Okay.

1648
00:55:49,850 --> 00:55:51,750
- We pick number two.
- Okay.

1649
00:55:52,440 --> 00:55:54,690
- Please!
- 1, 2...

1650
00:55:54,690 --> 00:55:56,290
- Please!
- I'm sorry.

1651
00:55:56,290 --> 00:55:57,710
- Why?
- There are none.

1652
00:55:57,710 --> 00:55:59,830
- None?
- There's one.

1653
00:55:59,830 --> 00:56:01,080
- 1?
- 1.

1654
00:56:01,080 --> 00:56:02,850
If you're sorry, then I'll take it.

1655
00:56:02,850 --> 00:56:05,190
I'm not that sorry.

1656
00:56:05,460 --> 00:56:07,190
We've lost two competitors.

1657
00:56:07,190 --> 00:56:08,190
Next.

1658
00:56:08,190 --> 00:56:09,730
- We pick number 1.
- Kwang Soo picked number 1.

1659
00:56:09,730 --> 00:56:12,440
Come on. Let's go.

1660
00:56:12,870 --> 00:56:15,410
(They only find 1 coin.)

1661
00:56:15,410 --> 00:56:16,770
- There's 1 coin.
- Just 1?

1662
00:56:16,770 --> 00:56:18,270
Open it.

1663
00:56:18,410 --> 00:56:19,480
- There's 1 coin. What a bummer.
- Just 1?

1664
00:56:19,480 --> 00:56:20,710
(Box number 5 has 1 coin.)

1665
00:56:20,710 --> 00:56:22,850
- There's 1 coin. What a bummer.
- Just 1?

1666
00:56:22,850 --> 00:56:23,870
Are they all in one box?

1667
00:56:23,870 --> 00:56:25,080
1 of these 2 boxes is a jackpot.

1668
00:56:25,520 --> 00:56:26,790
So Min, I feel hopeful.

1669
00:56:26,790 --> 00:56:28,580
- That was a smart move.
- Seriously?

1670
00:56:29,390 --> 00:56:31,390
(These 2
are the only remaining boxes.)

1671
00:56:32,020 --> 00:56:33,390
- We pick number four.
- Next up...

1672
00:56:33,390 --> 00:56:34,660
is So Min and Ji Hyo.

1673
00:56:34,660 --> 00:56:36,460
- Ji Hyo.
- 1, 2, 3.

1674
00:56:36,460 --> 00:56:37,830
(1 of the boxes have 62 coins.)

1675
00:56:37,830 --> 00:56:41,890
(They could turn the tables.)

1676
00:56:41,890 --> 00:56:43,190
- Look at it first.
- Will they get it?

1677
00:56:44,140 --> 00:56:45,390
What? There's just one.

1678
00:56:45,500 --> 00:56:46,910
(There's just 1 coin.)

1679
00:56:46,910 --> 00:56:48,310
What? There's just one.

1680
00:56:49,040 --> 00:56:50,810
I said it was number three.

1681
00:56:50,810 --> 00:56:53,210
- No way.
- They were so lucky.

1682
00:56:53,210 --> 00:56:55,270
- They're in first place.
- We should've picked the other one.

1683
00:56:55,310 --> 00:56:56,750
Right?

1684
00:56:56,750 --> 00:56:58,120
- Right?
- Whose idea was this?

1685
00:56:58,120 --> 00:56:59,310
- No way.
- It was the middle box.

1686
00:56:59,310 --> 00:57:01,390
You must've been surprised
when I wanted to pick number three.

1687
00:57:01,390 --> 00:57:03,460
Yes, we were shocked.

1688
00:57:03,850 --> 00:57:06,560
- We did it.
- This is unbelievable.

1689
00:57:06,560 --> 00:57:08,830
Lucky you.

1690
00:57:08,830 --> 00:57:10,390
Go, Suk Jin.

1691
00:57:10,390 --> 00:57:12,350
Let's get rid of these.

1692
00:57:12,350 --> 00:57:14,600
This too. Where's the "laptop"?

1693
00:57:14,600 --> 00:57:16,040
- It's here.
- Right.

1694
00:57:16,100 --> 00:57:18,100
- It'll be number 38.
- Number 19.

1695
00:57:18,100 --> 00:57:20,270
Let's put "Massage from Jong Kook"
down here.

1696
00:57:21,100 --> 00:57:23,270
- And...
- You'll probably get that one.

1697
00:57:23,410 --> 00:57:25,370
Pick.

1698
00:57:25,410 --> 00:57:28,480
The staff is determined
to give us gifts.

1699
00:57:28,480 --> 00:57:29,910
Give me the "laptop."

1700
00:57:29,910 --> 00:57:31,980
- They're all good prizes.
- I hope it's a dud.

1701
00:57:31,980 --> 00:57:32,980
Let's see.

1702
00:57:32,980 --> 00:57:36,060
<i>Dud, dud, dud</i>

1703
00:57:36,250 --> 00:57:37,290
- Number 45.
- Number 45.

1704
00:57:37,290 --> 00:57:38,290
(Suk Jin picks number 45.)

1705
00:57:38,290 --> 00:57:39,930
(What?)

1706
00:57:40,730 --> 00:57:43,930
"Massage from Jong Kook".

1707
00:57:43,930 --> 00:57:45,160
He picked that one?

1708
00:57:45,190 --> 00:57:46,390
- All right.
- No way!

1709
00:57:46,390 --> 00:57:48,890
- No way!
- I can't believe he picked it.

1710
00:57:48,890 --> 00:57:51,460
- This feels surreal.
- I'll give you a hip massage.

1711
00:57:51,500 --> 00:57:53,500
- "Hip massage"?
- Lie down.

1712
00:57:53,500 --> 00:57:54,730
- I'll give you a hip massage.
- Massage my shoulders instead.

1713
00:57:54,730 --> 00:57:55,830
No.

1714
00:57:55,830 --> 00:57:57,410
- Just do my shoulders.
- That's a nice prize.

1715
00:57:57,410 --> 00:57:59,850
- This is a rare opportunity.
- Lie sideways.

1716
00:58:00,310 --> 00:58:03,020
- What is this?
- This will make you healthier.

1717
00:58:03,020 --> 00:58:05,040
- Right. I'm good at this.
- What is this?

1718
00:58:05,040 --> 00:58:06,540
- It'll loosen up your muscles.
- It's good for your hips.

1719
00:58:06,540 --> 00:58:07,690
- Okay? I'll start now.
- Okay.

1720
00:58:07,690 --> 00:58:09,480
- How many seconds?
- Ready, set, go.

1721
00:58:09,480 --> 00:58:10,910
(He presses down.)

1722
00:58:12,460 --> 00:58:13,460
My gosh.

1723
00:58:13,460 --> 00:58:14,980
He dodged.

1724
00:58:16,020 --> 00:58:18,690
Gosh, seriously!

1725
00:58:20,230 --> 00:58:22,690
Jong Kook, aren't you supposed
to be massaging him.

1726
00:58:22,690 --> 00:58:24,100
- I did.
- This is his prize.

1727
00:58:24,100 --> 00:58:26,100
- You need to loosen them.
- It's acupressure.

1728
00:58:26,100 --> 00:58:27,660
- How is it?
- It's so painful.

1729
00:58:27,660 --> 00:58:29,270
- I bet it is.
- How was it?

1730
00:58:29,270 --> 00:58:30,500
Not bad.

1731
00:58:30,500 --> 00:58:32,270
- "Not bad"?
- Yes.

1732
00:58:32,580 --> 00:58:34,580
- I hope you get it.
- I'm cheering for him.

1733
00:58:34,580 --> 00:58:35,910
Number 41.

1734
00:58:35,910 --> 00:58:37,620
- It's a dud.
- It's a dud.

1735
00:58:37,620 --> 00:58:39,620
(He gets a dud.)

1736
00:58:39,980 --> 00:58:41,390
(He's still not lucky enough.)

1737
00:58:41,440 --> 00:58:43,080
- Okay!
<i>- Dud</i>

1738
00:58:43,080 --> 00:58:44,390
<i>- Dud, dud</i>
- This is great!

1739
00:58:44,390 --> 00:58:46,460
- Jae Suk.
- I can't believe this.

1740
00:58:46,460 --> 00:58:48,080
This was the only empty one.

1741
00:58:48,080 --> 00:58:50,660
- He wasted his luck on this!
- I can't believe it.

1742
00:58:50,830 --> 00:58:52,690
You're so unlucky.

1743
00:58:53,390 --> 00:58:56,040
(It's springtime,
and the flowers greet us.)

1744
00:58:56,290 --> 00:58:59,330
Hello, everyone. Good morning.

1745
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:01,660
It's been a while since you started
the race by yourself.

1746
00:59:01,660 --> 00:59:03,600
You're right. Here I am once again.

1747
00:59:03,600 --> 00:59:04,940
- Hello.
- This is simple.

1748
00:59:04,940 --> 00:59:06,100
Hello.

1749
00:59:06,100 --> 00:59:07,870
What are we doing today?

1750
00:59:08,370 --> 00:59:11,540
Before you arrive
at the opening venue,

1751
00:59:11,810 --> 00:59:14,040
you must pick an angel
and a devil...

1752
00:59:14,080 --> 00:59:16,890
among the members
while excluding yourself.

1753
00:59:16,890 --> 00:59:18,350
- An angel and a devil?
- Yes.

1754
00:59:18,350 --> 00:59:21,080
The devil may face
disadvantages in the upcoming race,

1755
00:59:21,080 --> 00:59:22,620
so please pick wisely.

1756
00:59:23,350 --> 00:59:24,750
This is hard.

1757
00:59:25,190 --> 00:59:27,060
Judging by their appearances,

1758
00:59:27,060 --> 00:59:28,930
don't Se Chan and Kwang Soo
look like a devil?

1759
00:59:29,600 --> 00:59:30,770
I'll give up.

1760
00:59:31,600 --> 00:59:32,600
(He thinks back
on the things he's done.)

1761
00:59:32,600 --> 00:59:35,160
I can't. An angel and a devil?

1762
00:59:35,870 --> 00:59:37,270
I need to pick a devil?

1763
00:59:37,270 --> 00:59:38,270
(She listens to the rules
and gets in the car.)

1764
00:59:38,270 --> 00:59:40,250
Hello, sir.

1765
00:59:40,310 --> 00:59:42,410
- Hello.
- Hello.

1766
00:59:43,040 --> 00:59:44,370
An angel and a devil?

1767
00:59:44,870 --> 00:59:46,040
An angel?

1768
00:59:46,290 --> 00:59:48,540
Once the filming is over,
they're all angels.

1769
00:59:49,080 --> 00:59:53,020
But during the filming,
all the angels disappear.

1770
00:59:54,020 --> 00:59:55,390
Hello, Mr. Angel.

1771
00:59:56,460 --> 00:59:57,850
(An angel appears.)

1772
00:59:57,850 --> 00:59:59,100
Hello, Angel Jee.

1773
00:59:59,250 --> 01:00:01,290
(Laughing)

1774
01:00:02,060 --> 01:00:05,500
Let's pick each other as the angel.

1775
01:00:05,600 --> 01:00:06,830
- Shall we?
- We can do that.

1776
01:00:06,830 --> 01:00:09,060
We can just pick each other.

1777
01:00:09,210 --> 01:00:11,310
Then pick me.

1778
01:00:11,310 --> 01:00:12,910
- Okay.
- Because...

1779
01:00:12,910 --> 01:00:16,410
I can't think of anyone to pick.

1780
01:00:16,410 --> 01:00:17,940
- Exactly.
- Right.

1781
01:00:17,940 --> 01:00:19,310
I can't think of anyone either,
so let's just pick each other...

1782
01:00:19,310 --> 01:00:20,580
- Okay.
- and not get humiliated.

1783
01:00:20,580 --> 01:00:21,750
Let's do that.

1784
01:00:21,750 --> 01:00:24,020
- Okay.
- Bye.

1785
01:00:24,020 --> 01:00:25,290
(They promise to pick each other
and hang up.)

1786
01:00:25,980 --> 01:00:28,080
I could use this strategy.

1787
01:00:28,190 --> 01:00:30,060
This will help me become an angel.

1788
01:00:30,120 --> 01:00:31,290
Angel Lee.

1789
01:00:32,120 --> 01:00:33,660
- Angel Lee.
- Hi.

1790
01:00:33,930 --> 01:00:35,830
You do know
that no one will pick you, right?

1791
01:00:35,830 --> 01:00:37,100
I do.

1792
01:00:37,100 --> 01:00:40,500
So let's just pick each other.

1793
01:00:40,810 --> 01:00:41,870
We can do that.

1794
01:00:41,870 --> 01:00:45,540
I will change your name
saved on my phone...

1795
01:00:45,600 --> 01:00:46,980
as Angel Jee.

1796
01:00:47,410 --> 01:00:48,710
As Angel Jee.

1797
01:00:49,640 --> 01:00:50,810
(Hold on.)

1798
01:00:50,810 --> 01:00:51,980
What did you say?

1799
01:00:52,080 --> 01:00:53,390
- Hey.
- Don't get me wrong.

1800
01:00:53,390 --> 01:00:54,910
Isn't that an antidiarrheal?

1801
01:00:54,910 --> 01:00:56,750
- That's not what I meant.
- It's an antidiarrheal.

1802
01:00:56,750 --> 01:00:57,980
I will pick you no matter what.

1803
01:00:57,980 --> 01:01:00,290
Okay. I'll pick you too, Angel Lee.

1804
01:01:00,290 --> 01:01:01,660
Let's do that then.

1805
01:01:02,190 --> 01:01:05,660
Gosh, there are no angels among us.

1806
01:01:06,370 --> 01:01:07,830
There really aren't any.

1807
01:01:08,190 --> 01:01:09,290
Jong Kook is calling.

1808
01:01:09,290 --> 01:01:10,640
(He receives a call from Jong Kook.)

1809
01:01:11,190 --> 01:01:12,190
Why, hello, Angel Kim.

1810
01:01:12,190 --> 01:01:14,640
- Hello, Angel Jee.
- You know what?

1811
01:01:14,640 --> 01:01:16,580
- My lovely.
- I was just about to call you.

1812
01:01:16,580 --> 01:01:19,230
I'm serious. What a coincidence.

1813
01:01:19,370 --> 01:01:22,210
Hey, what about we just pick
each other?

1814
01:01:22,210 --> 01:01:24,120
- I'll pick you.
- That's a promise.

1815
01:01:24,120 --> 01:01:26,190
Yes, I promise.

1816
01:01:26,190 --> 01:01:28,390
- Hello, Angel Song.
- Hello, Angel Jee.

1817
01:01:28,390 --> 01:01:31,960
I'm going to pick the person
who deserves it. And who is that?

1818
01:01:32,080 --> 01:01:33,580
It's you, Angel Song.

1819
01:01:33,580 --> 01:01:35,390
Why have you become so kind?

1820
01:01:35,980 --> 01:01:39,620
It's nothing. I just decided to be
a better person from this week on.

1821
01:01:39,620 --> 01:01:41,390
- I'll pick you.
- Okay.

1822
01:01:41,390 --> 01:01:42,500
You should pick me too.

1823
01:01:43,370 --> 01:01:44,730
Angel Ha.

1824
01:01:45,000 --> 01:01:46,310
Hello, my role model.

1825
01:01:47,310 --> 01:01:48,600
My guardian angel.

1826
01:01:48,600 --> 01:01:50,040
- Hey.
- Yes?

1827
01:01:50,100 --> 01:01:52,440
How about we pick each other?

1828
01:01:52,850 --> 01:01:54,500
Are you going to betray me?

1829
01:01:54,500 --> 01:01:56,140
- You'll only hurt me.
- I won't.

1830
01:01:56,310 --> 01:02:00,020
Life is all about getting betrayed.
Even my stocks have betrayed me.

1831
01:02:01,580 --> 01:02:05,460
Hey, life is all about betrayals.

1832
01:02:05,460 --> 01:02:06,580
Hey.

1833
01:02:06,580 --> 01:02:08,080
You can't always have it easy.

1834
01:02:08,080 --> 01:02:10,160
His stocks have betrayed him.

1835
01:02:11,020 --> 01:02:14,100
I feel so bad for you.
I'll pick you.

1836
01:02:14,100 --> 01:02:16,100
- All right.
- Okay.

1837
01:02:16,100 --> 01:02:18,600
Let's just pick each other.

1838
01:02:18,600 --> 01:02:19,640
Okay.

1839
01:02:21,000 --> 01:02:23,680
Gosh, I think he's really
going to pick me.

1840
01:02:23,680 --> 01:02:25,000
Am I just naive?

1841
01:02:25,500 --> 01:02:26,850
(Meanwhile, Jae Suk calls someone.)

1842
01:02:26,850 --> 01:02:28,350
Is this Angel Yu?

1843
01:02:29,310 --> 01:02:31,940
Goodness, it is you.

1844
01:02:31,940 --> 01:02:33,690
Gosh, where are you?

1845
01:02:34,390 --> 01:02:37,020
I'm on my way.

1846
01:02:37,390 --> 01:02:39,730
I truly think you're an angel.

1847
01:02:39,730 --> 01:02:41,350
- I really do.
- Why?

1848
01:02:43,250 --> 01:02:45,020
- Because...
- Yes?

1849
01:02:47,790 --> 01:02:50,660
Let's see. It's because...

1850
01:02:50,660 --> 01:02:54,040
What? You're disqualified!

1851
01:02:54,600 --> 01:02:56,140
- No, hear me out.
- You're disqualified.

1852
01:02:56,140 --> 01:02:59,710
You're done.
You had no plans to pick me.

1853
01:02:59,710 --> 01:03:02,680
To be honest,
you're a devil candidate.

1854
01:03:02,910 --> 01:03:05,870
Please, Jae Suk.
I need to be an angel.

1855
01:03:05,870 --> 01:03:07,250
- Please remember that.
- All right.

1856
01:03:07,250 --> 01:03:09,310
- I'll pick you then.
- Okay?

1857
01:03:09,810 --> 01:03:11,690
You truly are an angel.

1858
01:03:11,690 --> 01:03:13,480
All right. Goodbye.

1859
01:03:13,480 --> 01:03:14,660
Bye.

1860
01:03:16,460 --> 01:03:17,960
It feels awkward to say it.

1861
01:03:17,960 --> 01:03:19,890
It feels awkward saying,
"I am an angel."

1862
01:03:21,060 --> 01:03:22,600
(It's time to decide on
the angel and the devil.)

1863
01:03:22,600 --> 01:03:24,000
I am torn. This is driving me crazy.

1864
01:03:24,600 --> 01:03:26,160
The angel is my angel.

1865
01:03:26,160 --> 01:03:27,270
My angel is...

1866
01:03:27,270 --> 01:03:29,640
(Se Chan's angel is...)

1867
01:03:29,640 --> 01:03:30,940
I will pick Jong Kook.

1868
01:03:31,370 --> 01:03:34,000
Jong Kook is my angel.

1869
01:03:34,250 --> 01:03:36,040
I did promise him earlier.

1870
01:03:37,180 --> 01:03:40,640
Besides,
he isn't much of a threat to me.

1871
01:03:41,040 --> 01:03:42,310
I will choose Suk Jin.

1872
01:03:42,310 --> 01:03:43,480
(Jong Kook chooses Suk Jin
as the angel.)

1873
01:03:43,560 --> 01:03:45,660
The angel is Ji Hyo.

1874
01:03:46,080 --> 01:03:47,250
The devil is...

1875
01:03:47,930 --> 01:03:49,060
Jae Suk.

1876
01:03:49,930 --> 01:03:51,460
Would Suk Jin pick me as the angel?

1877
01:03:52,430 --> 01:03:54,020
I highly doubt that.
That's why he is the devil.

1878
01:03:55,000 --> 01:03:56,190
The devil is...

1879
01:03:56,190 --> 01:03:57,500
Jong Kook or Jae Suk?

1880
01:03:57,560 --> 01:03:58,600
Suk Jin.

1881
01:03:59,390 --> 01:04:00,770
Today,

1882
01:04:00,770 --> 01:04:01,770
(The rules are explained.)

1883
01:04:01,770 --> 01:04:03,980
you will need to identify
the devil among the members...

1884
01:04:03,980 --> 01:04:06,230
though the Devil's Whisper Race.

1885
01:04:07,540 --> 01:04:09,480
Depending on the results
of the first vote,

1886
01:04:09,480 --> 01:04:11,540
you will either gain
or lose ballots...

1887
01:04:11,540 --> 01:04:15,350
from the five
you were originally given.

1888
01:04:15,540 --> 01:04:16,790
So there are more angels.

1889
01:04:17,190 --> 01:04:19,210
Let's say you received
three angel votes...

1890
01:04:19,390 --> 01:04:21,830
and one devil vote.

1891
01:04:21,890 --> 01:04:25,290
Then you will receive
two more ballots...

1892
01:04:25,290 --> 01:04:26,890
and come to have
seven ballots in total.

1893
01:04:27,270 --> 01:04:29,190
I will attach something
to your head.

1894
01:04:29,270 --> 01:04:32,390
Make sure you don't see it.

1895
01:04:32,390 --> 01:04:33,440
(The current number of votes
is attached to the head.)

1896
01:04:33,440 --> 01:04:36,230
Should I turn around?
I can see my reflection.

1897
01:04:36,370 --> 01:04:37,600
Shall we go here?

1898
01:04:37,830 --> 01:04:40,770
Isn't this an angelic deed?

1899
01:04:40,770 --> 01:04:43,080
- So that I wouldn't see it...
- Okay.

1900
01:04:43,080 --> 01:04:46,210
So that I wouldn't see
the reflection, I turned around.

1901
01:04:46,620 --> 01:04:48,020
I could have seen it.

1902
01:04:48,750 --> 01:04:49,980
But only a devil would do that.

1903
01:04:51,660 --> 01:04:53,250
- Please turn around.
- Okay.

1904
01:04:53,580 --> 01:04:54,980
- I will face the wall.
- Okay.

1905
01:04:55,520 --> 01:04:57,750
This puts me at ease.
This puts my mind at ease.

1906
01:04:58,290 --> 01:04:59,870
I don't know why.
I was like this since childhood.

1907
01:05:00,690 --> 01:05:02,190
I was like this since birth.

1908
01:05:02,660 --> 01:05:04,330
If you come this way,
I will put it on your head.

1909
01:05:05,290 --> 01:05:08,100
(He wears a hat
with the result of the 1st vote.)

1910
01:05:08,100 --> 01:05:10,680
(0 angel votes and 0 devil votes)

1911
01:05:10,870 --> 01:05:12,210
Don't look at the reflection.

1912
01:05:15,140 --> 01:05:16,310
(1 angel vote and 5 devil votes)

1913
01:05:16,310 --> 01:05:18,520
(5 devil votes?)

1914
01:05:19,080 --> 01:05:20,120
(5 out of 8 people voted him
for the devil.)

1915
01:05:20,120 --> 01:05:22,640
- The devil is Jae Suk.
- Jae Suk.

1916
01:05:23,480 --> 01:05:26,020
- The result is on your head.
- Okay.

1917
01:05:26,190 --> 01:05:28,390
Will you accept...

1918
01:05:28,390 --> 01:05:31,660
the original result
or the reversed result?

1919
01:05:31,660 --> 01:05:34,020
(The original result: 1 ballot
The reversed: 9 ballots)

1920
01:05:34,020 --> 01:05:36,330
Why would you do
something like this?

1921
01:05:36,330 --> 01:05:38,100
(The original result: 1 ballot
The reversed: 9 ballots)

1922
01:05:39,060 --> 01:05:40,810
(Is there a reflection?)

1923
01:05:40,810 --> 01:05:41,960
Maybe I can see it.

1924
01:05:42,910 --> 01:05:44,080
This is...

1925
01:05:44,310 --> 01:05:45,710
This is...

1926
01:05:46,440 --> 01:05:48,270
I should go
with my gut feeling, right?

1927
01:05:48,540 --> 01:05:51,350
There is no way
I got the angel votes.

1928
01:05:51,580 --> 01:05:53,140
Why would they do that?

1929
01:05:53,390 --> 01:05:54,710
They wouldn't do that.

1930
01:05:54,810 --> 01:05:56,850
I bet I have many angel votes.

1931
01:05:57,080 --> 01:05:58,310
I will go with the original result.

1932
01:05:58,390 --> 01:05:59,750
- Really?
- Yes.

1933
01:06:00,790 --> 01:06:02,520
(Tell me.)

1934
01:06:02,520 --> 01:06:06,100
(He is fishing for information.)

1935
01:06:08,020 --> 01:06:09,160
What are you doing?

1936
01:06:09,160 --> 01:06:10,500
What?

1937
01:06:10,540 --> 01:06:12,230
- What?
- Hurry up and pick one.

1938
01:06:12,540 --> 01:06:13,730
What?

1939
01:06:15,160 --> 01:06:18,830
Not many people would pick me
as a devil.

1940
01:06:18,830 --> 01:06:21,600
I am sure the devil votes
went to a select few people.

1941
01:06:22,080 --> 01:06:24,080
I doubt I have many devil votes.

1942
01:06:24,180 --> 01:06:25,480
Please make a decision.

1943
01:06:26,440 --> 01:06:29,210
(He is a strong devil candidate
without any deducting skills.)

1944
01:06:29,210 --> 01:06:30,890
(What will be his decision?)

1945
01:06:30,890 --> 01:06:32,120
O.

1946
01:06:32,120 --> 01:06:33,250
What does that mean?

1947
01:06:33,250 --> 01:06:36,620
- I choose the original result.
- The original result.

1948
01:06:36,620 --> 01:06:37,890
- That's your choice, right?
- Yes.

1949
01:06:38,290 --> 01:06:39,500
Please check the result now.

1950
01:06:39,500 --> 01:06:41,770
(It's time for Jae Suk
to face reality.)

1951
01:06:41,770 --> 01:06:42,870
My goodness.

1952
01:06:47,100 --> 01:06:49,330
(What is this?)

1953
01:06:50,230 --> 01:06:51,480
This is the worst.

1954
01:06:51,810 --> 01:06:53,770
Did I really get five devil votes?

1955
01:06:55,600 --> 01:06:57,540
I should have gone
with the reversed result.

1956
01:06:57,940 --> 01:06:59,370
Do I get zero ballots?

1957
01:06:59,370 --> 01:07:01,480
No. Since you had 5 ballots,
we will give you 1.

1958
01:07:01,580 --> 01:07:02,790
For goodness' sake.

1959
01:07:02,790 --> 01:07:03,810
(I can't believe them.)

1960
01:07:04,350 --> 01:07:06,020
I bet I have more devil votes.

1961
01:07:06,060 --> 01:07:07,390
I will go with the reversed result.

1962
01:07:07,560 --> 01:07:08,830
- The reversed result?
- Yes.

1963
01:07:08,830 --> 01:07:11,120
There is no way
people picked me as the angel.

1964
01:07:11,560 --> 01:07:12,730
I will check the result.

1965
01:07:12,850 --> 01:07:14,020
1, 2, 3.

1966
01:07:15,790 --> 01:07:17,190
(Gosh!)

1967
01:07:17,190 --> 01:07:19,330
Who picked me as the angel?

1968
01:07:19,330 --> 01:07:21,210
Who did that?

1969
01:07:21,910 --> 01:07:24,080
I just came back
from a two-week hiatus.

1970
01:07:24,910 --> 01:07:26,100
(He diligently make deductions.)

1971
01:07:26,100 --> 01:07:27,580
So I doubt they picked me
as a devil.

1972
01:07:28,310 --> 01:07:30,410
- The original result.
- The original result?

1973
01:07:30,480 --> 01:07:31,620
No. Hold on.

1974
01:07:32,250 --> 01:07:33,690
I bet I received some devil votes.

1975
01:07:33,940 --> 01:07:35,250
Someone must have voted for me.

1976
01:07:35,250 --> 01:07:36,810
(Since no one gave him a vote,)

1977
01:07:36,810 --> 01:07:39,660
(the result will stay the same
either way.)

1978
01:07:39,930 --> 01:07:42,730
- The reversed result.
- The reversed result?

1979
01:07:42,730 --> 01:07:44,190
(He worries and changes his mind
in a meaningless fashion.)

1980
01:07:44,190 --> 01:07:46,250
The original result.
I won't change my mind again.

1981
01:07:46,250 --> 01:07:47,460
The original result.

1982
01:07:47,600 --> 01:07:48,660
- The original result.
- Yes.

1983
01:07:51,230 --> 01:07:53,410
(Then he checks the result.)

1984
01:07:53,830 --> 01:07:55,000
The original result
was the way to go, right?

1985
01:07:55,410 --> 01:07:57,140
It's the same either way.

1986
01:07:57,910 --> 01:07:59,270
(I see.)

1987
01:07:59,270 --> 01:08:00,500
There is no change.

1988
01:08:00,980 --> 01:08:02,140
I got zero votes.

1989
01:08:02,710 --> 01:08:03,940
This is upsetting.

1990
01:08:03,940 --> 01:08:05,210
(He has no sense of presence.)

1991
01:08:05,270 --> 01:08:06,980
Today, I will show you
what a true devil is.

1992
01:08:08,020 --> 01:08:11,080
I shouldn't have expected much.

1993
01:08:11,460 --> 01:08:13,230
They are too much.

1994
01:08:13,430 --> 01:08:16,560
Now, you can make the final vote
using the ballots you have acquired.

1995
01:08:16,660 --> 01:08:20,120
There are ballot boxes
with the members' names.

1996
01:08:20,120 --> 01:08:23,160
Write down the name
other than your own...

1997
01:08:23,460 --> 01:08:25,790
and put it
in that member's ballot box.

1998
01:08:26,190 --> 01:08:29,600
Use the white side
to vote for someone as the angel.

1999
01:08:30,000 --> 01:08:31,730
Use the side that's black...

2000
01:08:31,730 --> 01:08:35,040
to vote for someone as the devil.

2001
01:08:36,410 --> 01:08:38,770
What am I going to do
with a single vote?

2002
01:08:38,770 --> 01:08:42,120
We have a pouch for the ballots,
but since you have only one...

2003
01:08:42,120 --> 01:08:43,250
Give it to me.

2004
01:08:43,850 --> 01:08:45,060
(He takes everything he can.)

2005
01:08:45,060 --> 01:08:46,190
This is so annoying.

2006
01:08:46,460 --> 01:08:48,990
- Do I go and vote now?
- Ballot boxes are here and there.

2007
01:08:49,930 --> 01:08:51,650
They are here and there?

2008
01:08:53,230 --> 01:08:54,790
- Jong Kook.
- Suk Jin.

2009
01:08:54,790 --> 01:08:56,860
Your angel vote came from me.

2010
01:08:57,030 --> 01:08:59,200
Didn't you get an angel vote?

2011
01:08:59,200 --> 01:09:00,740
- I did.
- It came from me.

2012
01:09:01,500 --> 01:09:02,640
Really?

2013
01:09:02,640 --> 01:09:05,070
- Our deal worked out.
- I know.

2014
01:09:05,070 --> 01:09:06,650
- I voted for you.
- I voted for you.

2015
01:09:06,650 --> 01:09:08,540
That was me. Thank you.

2016
01:09:08,540 --> 01:09:11,110
- Don't be. I only kept my promise.
- Seriously.

2017
01:09:11,350 --> 01:09:12,610
(Actually,)

2018
01:09:12,610 --> 01:09:16,040
(Se Chan gave Jong Kook
an angel vote.)

2019
01:09:16,750 --> 01:09:19,210
(The angel is Ji Hyo.)

2020
01:09:19,490 --> 01:09:22,450
I knew you would need
one angel vote.

2021
01:09:22,890 --> 01:09:24,230
Thank you. I mean it.

2022
01:09:24,600 --> 01:09:25,650
Ji Suk Jin World.

2023
01:09:26,120 --> 01:09:27,700
- My mind is at ease...
- Right?

2024
01:09:27,700 --> 01:09:29,490
- to be in the Ji Suk Jin World.
- That's right.

2025
01:09:29,490 --> 01:09:30,600
This is great.

2026
01:09:30,600 --> 01:09:31,640
Hey.

2027
01:09:32,200 --> 01:09:34,140
Let's vote for each other.

2028
01:09:34,440 --> 01:09:36,270
- I will write your name.
- As the angel?

2029
01:09:36,270 --> 01:09:38,030
- Yes.
- I will do the same.

2030
01:09:38,740 --> 01:09:40,150
I have many ballots.

2031
01:09:40,150 --> 01:09:42,200
- I have many ballots.
- I have many ballots.

2032
01:09:42,200 --> 01:09:43,910
That's right. I can use one for you.

2033
01:09:43,910 --> 01:09:46,850
- Kim Jong Kook. I wrote it.
- Okay.

2034
01:09:46,850 --> 01:09:48,690
- Your handwriting is nice.
- I know.

2035
01:09:48,950 --> 01:09:50,110
Here.

2036
01:09:50,210 --> 01:09:52,650
- Ji Suk Jin.
- We can use one for each other.

2037
01:09:52,650 --> 01:09:54,030
- Of course. Where is yours?
- Go.

2038
01:09:54,030 --> 01:09:55,820
- It's over there.
- Why is it in a corner?

2039
01:09:55,820 --> 01:09:57,790
My goodness.

2040
01:09:57,860 --> 01:10:01,530
Why is it in a corner?

2041
01:10:01,530 --> 01:10:04,900
- "Corner Suk Jin" is my nickname.
- You are right.

2042
01:10:05,240 --> 01:10:06,810
- Corner Suk Jin.
- Yes?

2043
01:10:06,810 --> 01:10:08,700
I will cast this vote.

2044
01:10:09,000 --> 01:10:10,780
Okay, okay.

2045
01:10:10,780 --> 01:10:12,110
(Ji Suk Jin)

2046
01:10:12,110 --> 01:10:13,200
All right.

2047
01:10:14,200 --> 01:10:16,710
He stayed loyal since the beginning,

2048
01:10:17,210 --> 01:10:18,950
so I will use a ballot for him.

2049
01:10:22,040 --> 01:10:24,890
(Meanwhile)

2050
01:10:24,890 --> 01:10:26,060
(Hesitant)

2051
01:10:26,060 --> 01:10:27,230
Let's save it for now.

2052
01:10:28,280 --> 01:10:29,450
Let's save it for now.

2053
01:10:30,100 --> 01:10:32,030
Let's save it for now.
I will hide it.

2054
01:10:33,250 --> 01:10:35,490
Who is that? Suk Jin!

2055
01:10:36,100 --> 01:10:37,660
- Suk Jin.
- Hey.

2056
01:10:38,200 --> 01:10:39,770
What happened?

2057
01:10:40,640 --> 01:10:42,360
- You had one angel vote, right?
- What?

2058
01:10:42,360 --> 01:10:43,480
You had one angel vote, right?

2059
01:10:43,610 --> 01:10:45,530
- Did it come from you?
- That's right.

2060
01:10:46,370 --> 01:10:47,610
Didn't you vote for me?

2061
01:10:48,810 --> 01:10:50,110
I voted for you.

2062
01:10:50,910 --> 01:10:52,850
That didn't sound too convincing.

2063
01:10:52,850 --> 01:10:53,850
I voted for you.

2064
01:10:53,850 --> 01:10:55,410
- Right? That's how it is.
- Yes.

2065
01:10:55,410 --> 01:10:56,580
In that case,

2066
01:10:56,890 --> 01:10:57,990
how about this?

2067
01:10:58,950 --> 01:11:00,150
Let's start with a ballot.

2068
01:11:00,150 --> 01:11:01,530
- For whom?
- You.

2069
01:11:02,080 --> 01:11:03,250
Please give me an angel vote.

2070
01:11:03,320 --> 01:11:04,700
- You should vote for me too.
- Okay.

2071
01:11:05,200 --> 01:11:06,430
You have a ballot, right?

2072
01:11:06,600 --> 01:11:08,070
For goodness' sake.

2073
01:11:08,070 --> 01:11:09,990
- What are you talking about?
- You have a ballot, right?

2074
01:11:09,990 --> 01:11:11,740
- You have a ballot.
- Of course.

2075
01:11:11,740 --> 01:11:13,610
I have many ballots.

2076
01:11:13,900 --> 01:11:15,140
I will write your name.

2077
01:11:15,640 --> 01:11:17,570
Thank you so much.

2078
01:11:17,570 --> 01:11:19,030
- Write my name.
- I will write your name.

2079
01:11:19,610 --> 01:11:20,850
I will write your name.

2080
01:11:21,070 --> 01:11:22,500
- Let's vote for each other.
- Okay.

2081
01:11:22,700 --> 01:11:24,710
- I wrote your name.
- I wrote your name too. Okay.

2082
01:11:24,710 --> 01:11:26,450
My ballot box is there.

2083
01:11:26,450 --> 01:11:27,580
- Where?
- Over there.

2084
01:11:27,580 --> 01:11:29,390
Put it in there.
I will go and find your ballot box.

2085
01:11:30,190 --> 01:11:31,820
- Make sure you put it in there.
- Of course.

2086
01:11:32,320 --> 01:11:33,490
For goodness' sake.

2087
01:11:33,780 --> 01:11:35,560
Ballots keep coming back
to my pouch.

2088
01:11:36,280 --> 01:11:37,560
This is the second one.

2089
01:11:37,560 --> 01:11:39,150
(The ballots keep coming back
into Suk Jin's pouch.)

2090
01:11:39,150 --> 01:11:41,270
- Okay.
- Jong Kook, how was the result?

2091
01:11:41,270 --> 01:11:42,930
- It was good.
- It was heartwarming, right?

2092
01:11:42,930 --> 01:11:44,140
(Se Chan bows to him.)

2093
01:11:44,140 --> 01:11:45,160
Okay.

2094
01:11:45,160 --> 01:11:46,770
My guardian angel.

2095
01:11:46,960 --> 01:11:48,460
You are my angel.

2096
01:11:48,460 --> 01:11:50,870
- My guardian angel.
- You saw the result, right?

2097
01:11:50,870 --> 01:11:51,940
It was from me.

2098
01:11:51,940 --> 01:11:53,500
You saw the result, right?
I am serious.

2099
01:11:53,680 --> 01:11:55,040
- Move out of the way.
- My angel.

2100
01:11:55,040 --> 01:11:57,480
- I will keep it short.
- Did you receive my vote?

2101
01:11:57,610 --> 01:11:59,070
There is no way
you didn't get any angel votes.

2102
01:11:59,070 --> 01:12:00,240
He had more than one angel votes.

2103
01:12:00,240 --> 01:12:02,450
He had more than one angel votes
because I voted for him.

2104
01:12:02,850 --> 01:12:04,890
- Stop lying.
- I am not lying.

2105
01:12:04,890 --> 01:12:06,320
Watch the episode when it airs!

2106
01:12:06,320 --> 01:12:08,230
- Stop lying.
- Please.

2107
01:12:08,280 --> 01:12:09,450
Jae Suk.

2108
01:12:09,580 --> 01:12:10,700
The result was nice, right?

2109
01:12:10,700 --> 01:12:12,650
- My goodness.
- You are here.

2110
01:12:13,150 --> 01:12:14,700
We have someone impressive here.

2111
01:12:14,700 --> 01:12:16,400
- Jae Suk.
- He is impressive.

2112
01:12:16,400 --> 01:12:17,530
- I think...
- Excuse me.

2113
01:12:17,530 --> 01:12:18,640
Do you even have ballots?

2114
01:12:18,830 --> 01:12:20,140
I bet he doesn't have any.

2115
01:12:20,240 --> 01:12:22,400
- Of course, I have ballots.
- Really?

2116
01:12:22,400 --> 01:12:23,830
- I have ballots.
- Really?

2117
01:12:23,830 --> 01:12:25,310
Of course.

2118
01:12:25,500 --> 01:12:27,000
Do you know...

2119
01:12:27,000 --> 01:12:28,810
what's happening right now?

2120
01:12:28,950 --> 01:12:31,110
- We are headed that way.
- Why?

2121
01:12:31,110 --> 01:12:32,820
(What's there?)

2122
01:12:32,820 --> 01:12:33,850
(Yoo Jae Suk)

2123
01:12:33,850 --> 01:12:35,780
- Why are you headed that way?
- Is everyone here?

2124
01:12:36,080 --> 01:12:37,650
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

2125
01:12:37,650 --> 01:12:38,910
(Jae Suk's ballot box
is wildly popular.)

2126
01:12:39,450 --> 01:12:40,580
Let's go.

2127
01:12:40,580 --> 01:12:41,780
(Walking over)

2128
01:12:41,780 --> 01:12:43,730
- You can't vote for yourself.
- Is everyone here?

2129
01:12:43,730 --> 01:12:45,730
- Hold on.
- I have already been there.

2130
01:12:45,730 --> 01:12:47,320
- Kwang Soo.
- You can't vote for yourself.

2131
01:12:47,320 --> 01:12:49,790
- Where are you going?
- I'm standing in line.

2132
01:12:49,790 --> 01:12:50,860
Why would you go there?

2133
01:12:50,860 --> 01:12:52,830
This is the red carpet.

2134
01:12:52,990 --> 01:12:54,330
Why would you go there?

2135
01:12:54,460 --> 01:12:56,330
- Put one in there.
- Jae Suk, hold on.

2136
01:12:56,330 --> 01:12:57,680
- Put one in there.
- Hold on.

2137
01:12:57,830 --> 01:12:59,280
Apparently, you can vote
for the same person again.

2138
01:12:59,280 --> 01:13:00,450
- Really?
- Really?

2139
01:13:00,570 --> 01:13:02,110
- What...
- My goodness.

2140
01:13:02,180 --> 01:13:03,280
Why would you vote for me?

2141
01:13:03,280 --> 01:13:05,150
Apparently, you can vote
for the same person again.

2142
01:13:05,320 --> 01:13:06,410
I will go all in.

2143
01:13:06,410 --> 01:13:08,390
- I didn't know.
- I don't want to go anywhere else.

2144
01:13:08,540 --> 01:13:10,020
- Will you give me an angel vote?
- Jae Suk.

2145
01:13:10,020 --> 01:13:11,650
You can vote
for the same person again.

2146
01:13:11,650 --> 01:13:13,860
- Please put this in the ballot box.
- Really?

2147
01:13:14,320 --> 01:13:15,360
Why do you have so many?

2148
01:13:15,360 --> 01:13:17,530
It doesn't look like you're voting.

2149
01:13:17,530 --> 01:13:19,290
- Have you run out of ballots?
- I'm going to vote.

2150
01:13:19,290 --> 01:13:20,570
- Do you have some?
- Of course.

2151
01:13:20,570 --> 01:13:21,820
- You do have some.
- You do.

2152
01:13:21,820 --> 01:13:23,360
He has one.

2153
01:13:23,360 --> 01:13:24,960
I have a couple.

2154
01:13:24,960 --> 01:13:27,830
Jae Suk, if you run,
you'll win for sure.

2155
01:13:28,740 --> 01:13:29,960
Fine.

2156
01:13:30,310 --> 01:13:31,810
I'll vote for you.

2157
01:13:32,640 --> 01:13:34,370
- Is Jae Suk popular?
- Are you lining up?

2158
01:13:34,370 --> 01:13:36,240
- We're lining up.
- Is this the trend?

2159
01:13:36,240 --> 01:13:37,780
- Yes.
- Voting for him.

2160
01:13:37,780 --> 01:13:39,410
Excuse me.
Why are you butting the line?

2161
01:13:39,410 --> 01:13:40,650
- Why are you butting the line?
- My bad.

2162
01:13:40,650 --> 01:13:42,490
- You cut in very naturally.
- Is this the devil's den?

2163
01:13:42,490 --> 01:13:43,750
- Go back.
- Is this the devil's den?

2164
01:13:43,750 --> 01:13:45,360
- It's popular.
- It is.

2165
01:13:45,910 --> 01:13:47,560
I set up a tent
and slept here last night.

2166
01:13:48,890 --> 01:13:50,730
I stayed 3 days and 2 nights.

2167
01:13:50,730 --> 01:13:53,530
People fight here a lot...

2168
01:13:53,530 --> 01:13:54,860
because they butt the line.

2169
01:13:54,860 --> 01:13:57,290
He only has one left.

2170
01:13:57,990 --> 01:13:59,360
Leave him be.

2171
01:13:59,360 --> 01:14:01,200
(The voters are unperturbed.)

2172
01:14:01,440 --> 01:14:04,000
I don't have ballots,
so this is unfortunate.

2173
01:14:05,370 --> 01:14:08,310
Right. You reap what you sow.

2174
01:14:08,310 --> 01:14:12,070
He's an angel behind the cameras,

2175
01:14:12,070 --> 01:14:14,020
but this is Running Man,
so you can't help it.

2176
01:14:14,650 --> 01:14:16,580
- There was 1 person.
- I think there was 1 ballot.

2177
01:14:16,580 --> 01:14:18,280
(Haha gives 2 devil votes
to Jae Suk.)

2178
01:14:18,690 --> 01:14:20,020
If I get one vote, I won't do it.

2179
01:14:20,230 --> 01:14:21,860
It's full inside.

2180
01:14:22,490 --> 01:14:23,600
I'm sorry,

2181
01:14:23,700 --> 01:14:25,450
- but this is sold out.
- Why?

2182
01:14:25,450 --> 01:14:26,750
- Why?
- No!

2183
01:14:26,750 --> 01:14:28,200
- The ballot box is full.
- I lined up for days.

2184
01:14:28,200 --> 01:14:29,820
- It's totally full.
- What?

2185
01:14:29,820 --> 01:14:31,360
- I want to go in.
- There's no more space.

2186
01:14:31,360 --> 01:14:32,570
- I want to go in.
- It's totally full.

2187
01:14:32,570 --> 01:14:34,810
- Can you open it back up?
- It's totally full.

2188
01:14:34,810 --> 01:14:36,830
Is this break time? Can you open it?

2189
01:14:37,110 --> 01:14:38,180
(He's uncomfortable
with his own popularity.)

2190
01:14:38,180 --> 01:14:40,700
Can I buy some ballots?

2191
01:14:41,500 --> 01:14:43,400
I wish I could get around nine.

2192
01:14:44,450 --> 01:14:45,820
- Jae Suk.
- Yes?

2193
01:14:46,850 --> 01:14:48,280
I think...

2194
01:14:48,280 --> 01:14:49,390
(Sneaky Suk Jin is done
analyzing the market.)

2195
01:14:50,040 --> 01:14:51,280
you're the devil.

2196
01:14:51,690 --> 01:14:52,860
They are...

2197
01:14:52,860 --> 01:14:53,890
(They're lining up to vote.)

2198
01:14:53,890 --> 01:14:55,780
They're lining up.
It's a popular place.

2199
01:14:56,990 --> 01:14:59,100
Do you have one?

2200
01:14:59,100 --> 01:15:00,360
Hey.

2201
01:15:00,360 --> 01:15:02,290
- Be quiet.
- You have one.

2202
01:15:02,290 --> 01:15:03,940
- I made the wrong decision.
- Why?

2203
01:15:03,940 --> 01:15:05,530
I should have went the opposite way.

2204
01:15:05,530 --> 01:15:06,600
You should have.

2205
01:15:06,600 --> 01:15:08,030
- I would have had nine then.
- Right.

2206
01:15:08,030 --> 01:15:09,660
You should have went
the opposite way.

2207
01:15:10,140 --> 01:15:12,000
Didn't you know?

2208
01:15:12,870 --> 01:15:14,070
Didn't you have a feeling?

2209
01:15:14,070 --> 01:15:15,740
Hey, couldn't you tell?

2210
01:15:15,740 --> 01:15:17,020
You have no intuition.

2211
01:15:17,350 --> 01:15:18,410
My gosh.

2212
01:15:18,410 --> 01:15:19,480
(When did I stoop down
to his level?)

2213
01:15:19,480 --> 01:15:20,540
I'll see you later.

2214
01:15:20,540 --> 01:15:21,580
Where is he?

2215
01:15:21,580 --> 01:15:24,450
Do you want to check out
this new and upcoming place?

2216
01:15:24,450 --> 01:15:26,520
- What is it?
- It's up here.

2217
01:15:26,520 --> 01:15:28,560
This is like Gyeongridan-gil.
It's Kwangridan-gil.

2218
01:15:28,560 --> 01:15:30,150
- It's called Kwangridan-gil.
- No.

2219
01:15:30,150 --> 01:15:31,820
- It's not this way.
- Let's go to Kwangridan-gil.

2220
01:15:31,820 --> 01:15:33,660
- Let's go to Kwangridan-gil.
- What are you talking about?

2221
01:15:33,660 --> 01:15:34,930
Is this Kwangridan-gil?

2222
01:15:34,930 --> 01:15:36,200
- Yes.
- Let's go!

2223
01:15:36,200 --> 01:15:37,240
- Let's go to Kwangridan-gil.
- Everybody,

2224
01:15:37,240 --> 01:15:39,140
- this is Kwangridan-gil.
- No.

2225
01:15:39,140 --> 01:15:40,570
It's a popular spot.

2226
01:15:40,570 --> 01:15:42,960
- You must be a tour guide.
- I am. Follow me.

2227
01:15:42,960 --> 01:15:44,280
This place is very popular.

2228
01:15:44,280 --> 01:15:45,900
- Is it?
- Yes, it's Kwangridan-gil.

2229
01:15:46,000 --> 01:15:47,350
This is pretty.

2230
01:15:47,400 --> 01:15:49,000
Jong Kook,
Kwangridan-gil is so nice.

2231
01:15:49,000 --> 01:15:51,520
- This is nice. There's a lamp.
- This is not Kwangridan-gil.

2232
01:15:52,410 --> 01:15:53,910
There are flowers too.
This is so nice.

2233
01:15:53,910 --> 01:15:54,990
This is nice.

2234
01:15:54,990 --> 01:15:57,710
- This is it.
- This is Se Chan district.

2235
01:15:57,710 --> 01:16:00,650
- It's Se Chan district.
- Please keep going.

2236
01:16:00,650 --> 01:16:03,280
- Isn't the air good? It's spacious.
- Please pass by Se Chan district.

2237
01:16:03,280 --> 01:16:04,320
(A crowd gathers.)

2238
01:16:04,320 --> 01:16:05,450
Jong Kook.

2239
01:16:05,450 --> 01:16:06,930
- This is nice.
- It's great.

2240
01:16:06,930 --> 01:16:08,660
- Here it is.
- This is great.

2241
01:16:09,070 --> 01:16:10,960
- There's the sun too.
- Everybody.

2242
01:16:10,960 --> 01:16:11,960
(By topography, Kwang Soo's
ballot box is in an excellent area.)

2243
01:16:11,960 --> 01:16:13,460
This is a new tour.

2244
01:16:13,460 --> 01:16:16,330
- I'll check it out first.
- Welcome, everybody.

2245
01:16:16,330 --> 01:16:17,570
- You went in already.
- Yes.

2246
01:16:17,570 --> 01:16:19,030
- Of course.
- You were fast.

2247
01:16:19,030 --> 01:16:21,000
I'm going to vote for you.
I have many ballots.

2248
01:16:21,000 --> 01:16:22,040
(Will So Min give Kwang Soo
an angel or a devil vote?)

2249
01:16:22,900 --> 01:16:23,950
Kwang Soo,

2250
01:16:24,040 --> 01:16:27,040
I can't believe
you think of me that way. Look.

2251
01:16:27,040 --> 01:16:28,580
So Min, you're an angel.

2252
01:16:28,580 --> 01:16:30,280
What are you talking about?
What's wrong with you?

2253
01:16:30,280 --> 01:16:31,280
So Min.

2254
01:16:31,280 --> 01:16:35,560
(This world is still
a good place to live.)

2255
01:16:35,560 --> 01:16:36,820
(Scratching)

2256
01:16:36,820 --> 01:16:38,700
Hey, I heard you crossing it out.

2257
01:16:40,700 --> 01:16:43,290
(She erases his name
and turns it into a devil vote.)

2258
01:16:43,290 --> 01:16:44,570
- Hey.
- Even I heard it.

2259
01:16:44,570 --> 01:16:46,400
I heard it too.

2260
01:16:46,640 --> 01:16:48,200
I heard it too.

2261
01:16:48,200 --> 01:16:50,810
- That was so loud.
- That was too loud, So Min.

2262
01:16:50,810 --> 01:16:51,900
What was that?

2263
01:16:51,900 --> 01:16:53,900
Is there a microphone on the pen?

2264
01:16:53,900 --> 01:16:55,950
You just need to erase one letter.

2265
01:16:55,950 --> 01:16:58,180
Why were you crossing it out
so hard?

2266
01:16:58,710 --> 01:16:59,740
That was too loud.

2267
01:16:59,740 --> 01:17:02,150
I thought there was a fly.
What was that sound?

2268
01:17:02,150 --> 01:17:03,950
- She crossed it out too hard.
- I can't trust her.

2269
01:17:03,950 --> 01:17:05,360
Do you have one?

2270
01:17:05,360 --> 01:17:06,710
That was tasty.

2271
01:17:07,620 --> 01:17:08,650
That was delicious.

2272
01:17:08,650 --> 01:17:10,120
- Did you enjoy?
- That was delicious.

2273
01:17:10,120 --> 01:17:11,150
(So Min had a devil set menu
at Kwang Soo's restaurant.)

2274
01:17:11,150 --> 01:17:13,360
That was amazing, everybody.

2275
01:17:13,360 --> 01:17:15,160
That was the best restaurant
I've tried.

2276
01:17:15,160 --> 01:17:16,820
Where's Jeonridan-gil?

2277
01:17:16,820 --> 01:17:18,790
I want to go there all of a sudden.

2278
01:17:18,790 --> 01:17:20,400
- Jeonridan-gil does not exist.
- Jeonridan-gil.

2279
01:17:20,400 --> 01:17:22,530
- You have three minutes left.
- Where is Jeonridan-gil?

2280
01:17:22,530 --> 01:17:24,530
You lose the ballots you don't use.

2281
01:17:24,530 --> 01:17:26,180
- Really?
- I have one ballot left.

2282
01:17:26,180 --> 01:17:28,070
Tell me where Jeonridan-gil is.

2283
01:17:28,070 --> 01:17:29,350
I'm going to Haha's.

2284
01:17:29,480 --> 01:17:31,320
- He's a weasel.
- Wait.

2285
01:17:31,320 --> 01:17:33,280
He repeatedly said
I was his role model.

2286
01:17:33,650 --> 01:17:34,690
Haha.

2287
01:17:38,020 --> 01:17:41,690
(Jeonridan-gil is very popular.)

2288
01:17:42,820 --> 01:17:43,860
There's a lot.

2289
01:17:44,990 --> 01:17:46,250
Where's Jong Kook's?

2290
01:17:46,730 --> 01:17:48,100
Excuse me.

2291
01:17:49,200 --> 01:17:50,770
Do you know where Kook Francisco is?

2292
01:17:50,770 --> 01:17:52,200
- Where?
- Kook Francisco.

2293
01:17:52,200 --> 01:17:53,460
- It's over here.
- Where?

2294
01:17:53,460 --> 01:17:54,570
- Over here.
- I see.

2295
01:17:54,570 --> 01:17:56,440
(He asked around for
Kook Francisco.)

2296
01:17:57,480 --> 01:18:00,240
(Kwang Soo casts a vote.)

2297
01:18:00,570 --> 01:18:02,280
- Se Chan.
- You're confirmed.

2298
01:18:02,280 --> 01:18:04,610
- I'm done.
- You're the devil.

2299
01:18:05,320 --> 01:18:07,910
Okay, this is what I think.

2300
01:18:08,110 --> 01:18:10,780
Even if I had many ballots,
I would have become a devil.

2301
01:18:10,780 --> 01:18:12,060
- I'm certain.
- Okay.

2302
01:18:14,280 --> 01:18:15,690
Is he voting for Jong Kook?

2303
01:18:16,080 --> 01:18:17,790
For devils,

2304
01:18:17,790 --> 01:18:19,360
it's better to vote for Jong Kook.

2305
01:18:19,360 --> 01:18:21,400
Be quiet. Let me enjoy spring.

2306
01:18:22,530 --> 01:18:24,160
Hey.

2307
01:18:24,240 --> 01:18:26,940
Who cares
how many votes Jong Kook has?

2308
01:18:26,940 --> 01:18:28,200
Se Chan.

2309
01:18:28,770 --> 01:18:30,870
Jae Suk,
don't try to look composed.

2310
01:18:31,000 --> 01:18:33,240
- He's shaking right now.
- Se Chan.

2311
01:18:34,150 --> 01:18:35,870
Enjoy life.

2312
01:18:35,870 --> 01:18:37,150
(This is the bluff of a devil.)

2313
01:18:38,110 --> 01:18:39,110
Jae Suk.

2314
01:18:39,110 --> 01:18:40,740
This is a perfect day
to be a devil.

2315
01:18:42,910 --> 01:18:45,020
(The polls close
for angels and devils.)

2316
01:18:45,020 --> 01:18:47,580
I would like to tell those
who will become devils.

2317
01:18:47,950 --> 01:18:49,320
- If you...
- Excuse me.

2318
01:18:49,320 --> 01:18:50,700
He went to the bathroom.
He'll be back soon.

2319
01:18:50,700 --> 01:18:52,100
The devil is not here yet.

2320
01:18:52,100 --> 01:18:53,560
- He's not here yet.
- Right.

2321
01:18:53,560 --> 01:18:55,320
- Here comes the devil.
- Here he is.

2322
01:18:55,320 --> 01:18:56,730
Jae Suk,
he's announcing who the devils are.

2323
01:18:56,730 --> 01:18:57,790
There's an announcement.

2324
01:18:57,790 --> 01:19:00,740
- Devil.
- Relax, relax.

2325
01:19:00,740 --> 01:19:01,770
He told me to enjoy spring.

2326
01:19:01,770 --> 01:19:03,000
He's going to make
an announcement about the devils.

2327
01:19:03,000 --> 01:19:04,530
Relax.

2328
01:19:04,530 --> 01:19:06,030
- He's announcing the winners.
- Relax.

2329
01:19:06,030 --> 01:19:08,480
Let me tell you
who will become devils.

2330
01:19:09,310 --> 01:19:12,450
Even if your identity is revealed,
you should protect other devils.

2331
01:19:12,450 --> 01:19:13,540
(It's more beneficial to protect
the identities of other devils.)

2332
01:19:13,540 --> 01:19:14,820
We need to hide our identities.

2333
01:19:14,820 --> 01:19:16,020
I see.

2334
01:19:16,280 --> 01:19:18,020
- We know already.
- We know.

2335
01:19:18,020 --> 01:19:19,560
- We know.
- Jae Suk.

2336
01:19:19,560 --> 01:19:21,620
- His place was sold out.
- This is meaningless.

2337
01:19:21,780 --> 01:19:23,900
There were more angel votes
than expected.

2338
01:19:23,900 --> 01:19:25,450
- Really?
- That was unexpected.

2339
01:19:25,450 --> 01:19:27,360
- Really?
- There were angel votes?

2340
01:19:27,930 --> 01:19:29,160
- See?
- This is warm.

2341
01:19:29,160 --> 01:19:30,960
- Right. You never know.
- It's spring.

2342
01:19:31,490 --> 01:19:33,100
I used one angel vote.

2343
01:19:33,100 --> 01:19:35,000
- He's getting started again.
- I'm serious.

2344
01:19:35,000 --> 01:19:36,530
He even shaved.

2345
01:19:36,530 --> 01:19:37,940
- I'm serious.
- He'll pay for it.

2346
01:19:37,940 --> 01:19:39,480
Did you shave?

2347
01:19:39,480 --> 01:19:40,980
- Did you?
- That's why you looked weird.

2348
01:19:40,980 --> 01:19:42,370
- It looks weird.
- He looks so ugly.

2349
01:19:42,370 --> 01:19:43,700
Your face looks really weird.

2350
01:19:43,700 --> 01:19:45,350
- His beard made him look good.
- Did somebody hit you?

2351
01:19:45,350 --> 01:19:48,990
Hey, I told you before
you look weird without a beard.

2352
01:19:48,990 --> 01:19:50,910
After I shaved, I went home,

2353
01:19:50,910 --> 01:19:52,890
and my son is like,
"What's wrong with your face, Dad?"

2354
01:19:53,690 --> 01:19:54,780
What's wrong with your face?

2355
01:19:54,780 --> 01:19:57,060
He was not used to it.

2356
01:19:58,060 --> 01:19:59,290
I'm embarrassed.

2357
01:19:59,290 --> 01:20:00,450
He looks weird.

2358
01:20:00,490 --> 01:20:02,200
We all know who the devils are.

2359
01:20:02,200 --> 01:20:04,160
There might be a lot of angel votes.

2360
01:20:04,160 --> 01:20:05,330
You never know
how this will turn out.

2361
01:20:05,330 --> 01:20:07,360
- No.
- Don't say something weird.

2362
01:20:07,360 --> 01:20:08,400
Shut your mouth.

2363
01:20:08,640 --> 01:20:10,530
Shut your mouth. What do you know?

2364
01:20:12,900 --> 01:20:15,180
- He's a devil. He sounds like one.
- He's a devil.

2365
01:20:15,570 --> 01:20:17,000
He flipped.

2366
01:20:17,000 --> 01:20:19,110
He must be nervous right now.

2367
01:20:19,280 --> 01:20:20,910
Look at his hands.

2368
01:20:20,910 --> 01:20:23,210
- He's a devil.
- Kid's hands.

2369
01:20:23,210 --> 01:20:24,990
- He's mad.
- When kids get mad.

2370
01:20:24,990 --> 01:20:26,210
"What do you..."

2371
01:20:26,210 --> 01:20:27,930
"What do you know?"

2372
01:20:27,930 --> 01:20:31,100
We'll distribute the envelopes.

2373
01:20:31,100 --> 01:20:33,700
Read the content on your own.

2374
01:20:33,930 --> 01:20:35,290
- Okay.
- Jae Suk.

2375
01:20:35,290 --> 01:20:36,960
- Stop acting.
- What are you doing?

2376
01:20:36,960 --> 01:20:38,660
- What are you doing?
- It's him.

2377
01:20:38,830 --> 01:20:40,640
Please take the envelope
with your name on it.

2378
01:20:40,640 --> 01:20:43,900
Devils, it's beneficial for you
to act like you are angels.

2379
01:20:44,070 --> 01:20:45,480
Look.

2380
01:20:45,480 --> 01:20:48,240
The cherry blossoms have bloomed.

2381
01:20:48,240 --> 01:20:51,350
- We know.
- On a good day like this...

2382
01:20:51,350 --> 01:20:52,540
My gosh.

2383
01:20:52,540 --> 01:20:54,540
(Jae Suk is...)

2384
01:20:54,540 --> 01:20:55,850
(a devil.)

2385
01:20:55,850 --> 01:20:58,780
(No surprise there.)

2386
01:21:00,930 --> 01:21:02,150
It's your fault.

2387
01:21:02,820 --> 01:21:05,930
(Jae Suk is a devil.
Who are the remaining 2?)

2388
01:21:06,360 --> 01:21:07,930
Is this "The Voice of Korea"?

2389
01:21:07,930 --> 01:21:09,960
(The Voice of Running Man
with angels and devils)

2390
01:21:10,200 --> 01:21:11,600
(Is this a blind audition...)

2391
01:21:11,600 --> 01:21:13,440
(where you only compete
with your voice?)

2392
01:21:13,440 --> 01:21:15,740
(The members are surprised to see
these four popular actors!)

2393
01:21:15,740 --> 01:21:17,480
(Ahn Bo Hyun, Ji Eui Soo)

2394
01:21:17,480 --> 01:21:19,400
(Song Jin Woo, Lee Joo Young)

2395
01:21:19,400 --> 01:21:21,180
There's a devil on our team.

2396
01:21:21,180 --> 01:21:24,820
(The race between
angels and devils starts now.)

2397
01:21:24,910 --> 01:21:26,070
You got it.

2398
01:21:26,820 --> 01:21:30,080
(A desperate struggle to escape
the branding as a devil)

2399
01:21:30,240 --> 01:21:32,250
(The devils have been
decided already.)

2400
01:21:32,520 --> 01:21:35,230
(Meanwhile, the devils' advocate
for themselves.)

2401
01:21:35,730 --> 01:21:37,280
(When the devils are on the move,)

2402
01:21:37,280 --> 01:21:39,250
(they can destroy a team?)

2403
01:21:39,450 --> 01:21:40,660
(It's a close tug-of-war...)

2404
01:21:40,660 --> 01:21:43,490
(between the angels
and the invisible devils.)

2405
01:21:43,960 --> 01:21:46,460
(Which angels will protect
their team from the 3 devils?)

2406
01:21:46,460 --> 01:21:47,500
I won't stay still.

2407
01:21:47,500 --> 01:21:48,810
(I Saw the Angels and Devils:
The Devils' Advocates)
