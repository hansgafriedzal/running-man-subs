1
00:00:06,220 --> 00:00:07,620
- Hello.
- Hello.

2
00:00:07,620 --> 00:00:08,640
Hello.

3
00:00:08,640 --> 00:00:10,090
- Hello.
- Hello.

4
00:00:10,090 --> 00:00:12,020
- Hey.
- You're here.

5
00:00:12,020 --> 00:00:13,730
- Kwang Soo.
- Hello, Jong Kook.

6
00:00:13,730 --> 00:00:15,320
Look at him. Gosh.

7
00:00:15,320 --> 00:00:17,150
Aren't these pants for Heungbu?

8
00:00:17,320 --> 00:00:18,820
- What?
- This is what Heungbu would wear.

9
00:00:18,820 --> 00:00:20,800
- They are stylish.
- They are a little...

10
00:00:20,870 --> 00:00:22,060
You said that when I wore them.

11
00:00:22,060 --> 00:00:24,170
It's different from what you wore.
Yours had patches.

12
00:00:24,170 --> 00:00:25,370
- Suk Jin.
- These have patches too.

13
00:00:25,370 --> 00:00:27,440
- They are different.
- You just don't look good in them.

14
00:00:27,440 --> 00:00:29,580
How dare you say that, you fool?

15
00:00:29,580 --> 00:00:32,080
Go ahead and hit me. Just do it.

16
00:00:32,080 --> 00:00:33,800
He would never hit you.

17
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:36,210
He pretended to hit you,
but he actually made a heart shape.

18
00:00:36,620 --> 00:00:38,220
(I will punish you with a heart.)

19
00:00:38,580 --> 00:00:41,580
I always wait for him
to punch me, but he never does.

20
00:00:42,010 --> 00:00:43,220
You know what?

21
00:00:43,220 --> 00:00:44,980
So Min's doctor...

22
00:00:44,980 --> 00:00:48,020
advised her to be
hospitalized for a while.

23
00:00:48,020 --> 00:00:51,020
Dear viewers,
please don't worry about her.

24
00:00:51,020 --> 00:00:53,900
She's a cheerful girl.
She'll be back soon.

25
00:00:53,900 --> 00:00:56,400
- I know.
- I hope so.

26
00:00:56,400 --> 00:00:59,370
Today, we prepared a race where
you give your juniors warm touches.

27
00:00:59,370 --> 00:01:00,370
Warm touches for our juniors?

28
00:01:00,370 --> 00:01:01,900
It's called Running Man Class Race.

29
00:01:01,900 --> 00:01:03,200
- What?
- Touches for juniors?

30
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:04,540
- Then...
- It says Team Comedian,

31
00:01:04,540 --> 00:01:06,300
- Team Actor, and Team Singer.
- Is that what we're doing today?

32
00:01:06,300 --> 00:01:07,550
Are there going to be
junior comedians?

33
00:01:07,800 --> 00:01:10,440
We've divided you into three teams
according to your job.

34
00:01:10,440 --> 00:01:13,290
Team Comedian has Jae Suk,
Suk Jin, and Se Chan.

35
00:01:13,290 --> 00:01:15,020
- I see.
- Right. We are comedians.

36
00:01:15,020 --> 00:01:17,460
Team Singer has Jong Kook and Haha.

37
00:01:17,460 --> 00:01:19,930
And Team Actor has
Ji Hyo and Kwang Soo.

38
00:01:19,930 --> 00:01:21,760
It's a little ambiguous
for Kwang Soo though.

39
00:01:23,100 --> 00:01:24,600
(It's a little ambiguous
for Kwang Soo though.)

40
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:25,790
He's also a comedian.

41
00:01:25,790 --> 00:01:27,100
What are you talking about?

42
00:01:27,100 --> 00:01:28,600
- He's a comedian slash actor.
- What's ambiguous?

43
00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:30,790
- He's a comedian slash actor.
- Isn't he a comedian slash actor?

44
00:01:30,790 --> 00:01:32,300
- He's not just an actor.
- It is ambiguous.

45
00:01:32,300 --> 00:01:33,300
- Right.
- But I'm actually an actor.

46
00:01:33,300 --> 00:01:34,960
Aren't you a comedian slash actor?

47
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:36,510
- He's Jack Black of Korea.
- Right.

48
00:01:36,510 --> 00:01:37,630
Jack Black?

49
00:01:37,630 --> 00:01:39,070
- I'm flattered.
- Jim Carrey of Korea.

50
00:01:39,070 --> 00:01:40,300
I'm very flattered.

51
00:01:40,300 --> 00:01:42,010
- You're amazing.
- I'm grateful you say that.

52
00:01:42,010 --> 00:01:44,020
- You're great.
- I'm very honored.

53
00:01:44,020 --> 00:01:46,320
- You're just like Jim Carrey.
- Right. He's like Chow Sing Chi.

54
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:47,990
- There are many actors like that.
- I'm flattered.

55
00:01:47,990 --> 00:01:51,710
You will wear a badge that shows
your years of experience today.

56
00:01:51,710 --> 00:01:53,380
- My gosh.
- A badge?

57
00:01:53,380 --> 00:01:55,290
Hang on. How long have I been
in this industry?

58
00:01:55,290 --> 00:01:56,900
Suk Jin, do you have
28 years of experience?

59
00:01:56,900 --> 00:01:58,690
Gosh, it's been 30 years
since my debut.

60
00:01:58,690 --> 00:02:00,190
Jae Suk is the senior here.

61
00:02:00,190 --> 00:02:01,460
I have the longest career.

62
00:02:01,460 --> 00:02:02,900
You've been in this field
for 16 years?

63
00:02:02,900 --> 00:02:04,430
Yes. It's been 16 years.

64
00:02:04,430 --> 00:02:06,430
- I made my debut in 2005.
- It's been a long time.

65
00:02:06,430 --> 00:02:07,710
It's a long time.

66
00:02:07,710 --> 00:02:09,430
She has 20 years of experience.

67
00:02:09,430 --> 00:02:10,630
She's a senior.

68
00:02:10,630 --> 00:02:11,710
Gosh, it's been 20 years already.

69
00:02:11,710 --> 00:02:14,170
- Ji Hyo is a senior in her field.
- That's true.

70
00:02:14,170 --> 00:02:15,410
Not yet, Jae Suk.

71
00:02:15,410 --> 00:02:16,820
- Yes, you are.
- No.

72
00:02:16,820 --> 00:02:18,380
- That's not true.
- We have about 150 years...

73
00:02:18,380 --> 00:02:19,590
of experience put together.

74
00:02:19,590 --> 00:02:21,640
This is a little
embarrassing though.

75
00:02:21,640 --> 00:02:23,560
- We're like turtles.
- Why is it embarrassing?

76
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:25,590
- Kwang Soo has 13 years.
- That's right.

77
00:02:25,590 --> 00:02:27,560
Does it include your model career?

78
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:30,260
I made my debut
in a TV commercial.

79
00:02:30,290 --> 00:02:34,000
(Kwang Soo made his debut
in a TV commercial in 2008.)

80
00:02:34,690 --> 00:02:35,690
That's when you debuted.

81
00:02:35,690 --> 00:02:37,160
- Is that it?
- Yes.

82
00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:38,690
You've been a comedian since then.

83
00:02:38,690 --> 00:02:41,260
He has the hairstyle
of a would-be comedian.

84
00:02:41,260 --> 00:02:44,570
Look at his face. It's obviously
a picture of a comedian.

85
00:02:44,570 --> 00:02:46,850
He lifted the left corner of his
lips. That's what comedians do.

86
00:02:46,850 --> 00:02:49,070
I tried to look cool
when I took this picture,

87
00:02:49,070 --> 00:02:50,380
but I was harshly criticized.

88
00:02:50,850 --> 00:02:52,220
"That's not you."

89
00:02:52,750 --> 00:02:53,880
"Pull yourself together."

90
00:02:54,350 --> 00:02:55,590
What's with you these days?

91
00:02:55,590 --> 00:02:57,690
- Why do you try to look cool?
- Today,

92
00:02:57,760 --> 00:03:01,350
entertainers who debuted either
before or after you are here.

93
00:03:01,350 --> 00:03:02,730
I want to team up with someone
who debuted after me.

94
00:03:02,850 --> 00:03:04,600
Guests, please come out!

95
00:03:04,950 --> 00:03:07,390
Will the comedians try to be funny,
falling on purpose or something?

96
00:03:08,420 --> 00:03:10,230
- It's Cho Sae Ho.
- He debuted 20 years ago?

97
00:03:12,660 --> 00:03:13,760
- Rowoon!
- It's been a while.

98
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:14,760
Oh, my.

99
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:15,980
Do Hyun!

100
00:03:17,540 --> 00:03:19,440
- Oh, my.
- Hey!

101
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:20,750
You're both so good-looking.

102
00:03:20,750 --> 00:03:22,820
- Hi, Sa Yeon.
- I missed you.

103
00:03:22,820 --> 00:03:24,320
- She's our mom.
- Beautiful Deer.

104
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:26,640
What's incredible is...

105
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:28,540
that Sa Yeon has been
in the show business...

106
00:03:28,540 --> 00:03:31,350
for 43 years now, surviving
all the ups and downs.

107
00:03:31,350 --> 00:03:32,820
(She's been in show business
for half a century now.)

108
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:34,790
- Right?
- Yes.

109
00:03:34,790 --> 00:03:35,890
I'm sorry.

110
00:03:35,890 --> 00:03:39,570
- This is why you adore me.
- You're the best.

111
00:03:39,570 --> 00:03:40,600
Can you...

112
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:41,760
All right.

113
00:03:42,570 --> 00:03:43,630
Can you...

114
00:03:43,970 --> 00:03:45,660
(Jae Suk pats Suk Jin
on the head.)

115
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:47,840
- Jae Suk debuted first.
- Right.

116
00:03:47,910 --> 00:03:49,840
- I can see you debuted first.
- Right.

117
00:03:50,700 --> 00:03:51,880
You definitely debuted first.

118
00:03:51,880 --> 00:03:53,980
- Should I put up with this?
- You should.

119
00:03:54,140 --> 00:03:55,820
- All right.
- You should.

120
00:03:55,820 --> 00:03:58,440
- You should just laugh it off.
- Next up is...

121
00:03:58,510 --> 00:03:59,880
Hong Jin Young.

122
00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:01,410
- Hello.
- Jin Young.

123
00:04:01,790 --> 00:04:03,010
Our little sister, Jin Young.

124
00:04:03,610 --> 00:04:05,880
- How are you doing these days?
- I happen to...

125
00:04:05,880 --> 00:04:09,030
have released a new song recently.

126
00:04:09,030 --> 00:04:11,130
- I released a new song.
- You released a new song?

127
00:04:11,160 --> 00:04:12,730
All right, let's hear it.

128
00:04:12,730 --> 00:04:14,130
(Jin Young performs her new song
right away.)

129
00:04:14,130 --> 00:04:15,630
- That was fast.
- I can't wait.

130
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:18,340
I'm sure she's hiding something.

131
00:04:18,340 --> 00:04:20,510
(She starts performing
without even introducing her song.)

132
00:04:20,660 --> 00:04:21,800
Is it tango?

133
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:24,800
("Love Is Like a Petal"
by Hong Jin Young)

134
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:26,710
- It's tango.
- You dance?

135
00:04:26,710 --> 00:04:28,580
(The intro has
a catchy tango melody.)

136
00:04:28,580 --> 00:04:30,280
She dances a lot in this song.

137
00:04:30,980 --> 00:04:33,980
(This time, we even get to see
her dance moves.)

138
00:04:34,520 --> 00:04:37,980
(Don't leave me)

139
00:04:37,980 --> 00:04:41,250
(Stay close to me)

140
00:04:41,250 --> 00:04:44,400
(Just one more day)

141
00:04:44,750 --> 00:04:49,200
(She sings so passionately
as if this is her concert.)

142
00:04:50,660 --> 00:04:55,500
(The song is upbeat yet emotional,
which is Jin Young's trademark.)

143
00:04:58,410 --> 00:05:01,150
(She finishes the song perfectly.)

144
00:05:02,210 --> 00:05:03,780
That was amazing.

145
00:05:03,780 --> 00:05:05,020
You're a singing machine.

146
00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:06,290
Thank you.

147
00:05:07,220 --> 00:05:08,850
Next up is...

148
00:05:08,850 --> 00:05:11,250
- Cho Sae Ho.
- Is it me?

149
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:14,480
Sae Ho won the KBS
Music and Talk Award last year.

150
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:15,960
It was from MBC.

151
00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:17,050
- It was from MBC.
- The MBC Music and Talk Award.

152
00:05:17,050 --> 00:05:18,330
I still don't understand.

153
00:05:18,330 --> 00:05:21,400
- Why did you win that award?
- What is that award anyway?

154
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:23,840
I've shown outstanding musicality...

155
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:25,860
- and been active...
- The Music and Talk Award.

156
00:05:25,860 --> 00:05:27,340
- on talk shows.
- All right.

157
00:05:27,340 --> 00:05:28,840
One of us won the Popularity Award.

158
00:05:30,170 --> 00:05:31,580
We should respect
the Music and Talk Award.

159
00:05:31,580 --> 00:05:32,710
I won the Social Media
Popularity Award too.

160
00:05:32,710 --> 00:05:34,280
I respect that.

161
00:05:34,280 --> 00:05:35,540
Thank you.

162
00:05:35,540 --> 00:05:39,590
Every award Sae Ho wins
seems to disappear the next year.

163
00:05:40,310 --> 00:05:42,110
It's given out only that year.

164
00:05:42,180 --> 00:05:43,590
Also...

165
00:05:43,750 --> 00:05:45,310
Sae Ho...

166
00:05:45,310 --> 00:05:47,830
Suk Jin, looking at you
from the side,

167
00:05:47,890 --> 00:05:49,160
your complexion is pale.

168
00:05:50,490 --> 00:05:53,060
(Your complexion is pale.)

169
00:05:53,660 --> 00:05:56,140
(Sa Yeon's diagnosis
catches Suk Jin off guard.)

170
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:58,140
- All of a sudden?
- All of a sudden?

171
00:05:58,140 --> 00:05:59,470
(Everyone else finds it hilarious.)

172
00:05:59,470 --> 00:06:01,140
She was staring at him
the whole time.

173
00:06:01,210 --> 00:06:02,470
His complexion is pale?

174
00:06:02,470 --> 00:06:04,500
- His complexion is pale?
- Are you sick?

175
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:06,480
Gosh, I'm healthy.

176
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:07,500
- Are you sure?
- Yes.

177
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:08,670
His complexion is pale?

178
00:06:08,670 --> 00:06:10,350
- What do you mean?
- What does she even mean?

179
00:06:10,350 --> 00:06:11,720
He looks so pale.

180
00:06:11,740 --> 00:06:13,650
- It's just my makeup.
- It's his makeup.

181
00:06:14,110 --> 00:06:16,960
It's just that his makeup is
too bright.

182
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:19,020
That's the funniest thing
I've heard this year.

183
00:06:19,020 --> 00:06:21,120
Next up is the rising star,

184
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:22,550
Rowoon!

185
00:06:23,420 --> 00:06:25,530
- He's really good-looking.
- He's so handsome.

186
00:06:25,530 --> 00:06:26,860
He's a great singer too.

187
00:06:26,860 --> 00:06:28,900
- He's been on this show before.
- Right.

188
00:06:28,900 --> 00:06:30,360
Are you the one who wore my jacket?

189
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:31,990
- That's right.
- That's right.

190
00:06:32,660 --> 00:06:35,000
(Rowoon briefly appeared
in the Unboxing Race.)

191
00:06:35,710 --> 00:06:38,370
(Rowoon is wearing
Suk Jin's jacket.)

192
00:06:38,670 --> 00:06:41,370
(The same jacket
looks completely different.)

193
00:06:41,710 --> 00:06:43,870
- Can you try Suk Jin's jacket on?
- Come on.

194
00:06:44,370 --> 00:06:45,870
Just try it on.

195
00:06:46,180 --> 00:06:47,410
Look at Rowoon.

196
00:06:47,650 --> 00:06:49,550
He looks amazing
even in a white T-shirt and jeans.

197
00:06:49,550 --> 00:06:51,810
- This is the best outfit for him.
- You look better now.

198
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:53,160
Let me see.

199
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:54,330
Gosh, Rowoon.

200
00:06:55,790 --> 00:06:57,730
So that's how this jacket
should look.

201
00:06:58,230 --> 00:07:00,200
- That jacket looks great.
- Thank you.

202
00:07:00,270 --> 00:07:02,200
It's the Grim Reaper!

203
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:03,430
(The Fashion Grim Reaper is here.)

204
00:07:03,430 --> 00:07:04,660
It's the Grim Reaper!

205
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:07,500
Who are you?

206
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:09,780
(Seeing Suk Jin in broad daylight
makes you back away.)

207
00:07:09,780 --> 00:07:10,800
That's hilarious.

208
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:14,150
After his appearance on this show,
he became the most searched person.

209
00:07:14,150 --> 00:07:15,800
Lee Do Hyun!

210
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:17,310
(This actor with 4 years of
experience has unexpected charms.)

211
00:07:17,310 --> 00:07:19,350
- The clubber!
- More than anything,

212
00:07:19,410 --> 00:07:23,250
Running Man made him
known to a lot of people recently.

213
00:07:23,310 --> 00:07:24,810
Did your family watch the show?

214
00:07:24,810 --> 00:07:27,290
Yes, my mother asked me
why I danced like that.

215
00:07:28,730 --> 00:07:30,790
(Do Hyung's club dance...)

216
00:07:30,790 --> 00:07:33,160
(made his mother worried.)

217
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:37,200
(Her worry is understandable.)

218
00:07:37,540 --> 00:07:40,340
- Give Do Hyun a big hand!
- Thank you.

219
00:07:40,340 --> 00:07:41,770
(All the guests
have been introduced.)

220
00:07:41,770 --> 00:07:43,980
Today's race is called
"Running Man Class Race,"

221
00:07:43,980 --> 00:07:45,540
and you'll compete for prize sticks.

222
00:07:45,540 --> 00:07:46,650
The prizes look amazing.

223
00:07:46,710 --> 00:07:49,580
Each of you will start
with two sticks.

224
00:07:49,580 --> 00:07:51,370
After each mission,
more sticks will be handed out...

225
00:07:53,220 --> 00:07:55,240
The team with the most sticks wins.

226
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:59,250
The winning team can draw as many
prizes as the sticks they have.

227
00:08:00,920 --> 00:08:02,530
You'll win a massage chair today.

228
00:08:02,660 --> 00:08:06,230
To move up the hierarchy,
you can buy years.

229
00:08:06,290 --> 00:08:08,920
One stick is worth five years.

230
00:08:09,060 --> 00:08:10,290
That's a big jump.

231
00:08:10,290 --> 00:08:13,000
That will give you an edge
in the next mission.

232
00:08:13,660 --> 00:08:16,600
- The more years, the better?
- I guess I'm at an advantage.

233
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:17,600
That's right.

234
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:20,350
At any time during the race,
you may ring the Senior's Bell...

235
00:08:20,410 --> 00:08:23,910
and give those below you
advice and encouragement.

236
00:08:24,740 --> 00:08:26,090
It means nagging.

237
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:29,520
Please change
and go to the first mission spot.

238
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:31,520
(Let's start the mission!)

239
00:08:32,520 --> 00:08:34,030
- Suk Jin.
- Yes?

240
00:08:34,030 --> 00:08:35,550
Can I get some water?

241
00:08:35,790 --> 00:08:37,100
- Pardon?
- Can I sit here?

242
00:08:37,620 --> 00:08:38,830
Sit here.

243
00:08:39,020 --> 00:08:41,170
- Do you have any water?
- Have some of Jae Suk's.

244
00:08:41,170 --> 00:08:42,570
- I don't want someone else's.
- I'll get you some.

245
00:08:43,230 --> 00:08:45,340
You don't have to do that, Rowoon.

246
00:08:45,340 --> 00:08:46,600
I didn't ask you to do that.

247
00:08:46,710 --> 00:08:48,970
Suk Jin, get your water yourself.

248
00:08:49,230 --> 00:08:50,530
(Rowoon ends up
getting water for Suk Jin.)

249
00:08:50,530 --> 00:08:51,980
I didn't mean it.

250
00:08:52,340 --> 00:08:53,600
I want to drink some water too.

251
00:08:54,140 --> 00:08:57,510
Everyone, the first mission
where you can win prize sticks is...

252
00:08:57,510 --> 00:08:59,590
- Songs from the Old Days.
- Songs from the Old Days.

253
00:08:59,780 --> 00:09:01,640
Guess the top three songs
of each year...

254
00:09:01,640 --> 00:09:03,590
according to
the largest streaming sites.

255
00:09:03,590 --> 00:09:04,850
(Guess the top 3 songs
of each year.)

256
00:09:04,850 --> 00:09:07,620
Each team will take turns
selecting a year.

257
00:09:07,620 --> 00:09:10,100
The team that gets the song title
and singer right wins a point.

258
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:12,430
You can also get
an additional point...

259
00:09:12,430 --> 00:09:13,760
if you get a score higher than 90.

260
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:16,490
After five rounds,

261
00:09:16,490 --> 00:09:19,440
prize sticks will be handed out
according to the teams' scores.

262
00:09:19,470 --> 00:09:21,440
- That sounds fun.
- We can cover many periods.

263
00:09:22,030 --> 00:09:23,580
- Okay.
- Team Comedian has an advantage.

264
00:09:23,630 --> 00:09:26,810
- We're the most likely to win.
- You're right.

265
00:09:26,810 --> 00:09:28,000
I've been the King of Kings
on "Challenge 1000 Songs"...

266
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,210
- many times.
- Really?

267
00:09:29,210 --> 00:09:31,270
Yes. I've been the King of Kings
2 or 3 times.

268
00:09:31,420 --> 00:09:32,550
"Challenge 1000 Songs"?

269
00:09:32,610 --> 00:09:35,050
- You must have won a lot of gold.
- I was on the panel...

270
00:09:35,050 --> 00:09:36,090
- with Chang Hee.
- Really?

271
00:09:36,090 --> 00:09:37,250
Gosh, what was that?

272
00:09:38,650 --> 00:09:40,150
(Pinching)

273
00:09:40,150 --> 00:09:41,620
- What was that?
- Sae Ho,

274
00:09:41,620 --> 00:09:43,020
he wants you to be quiet.

275
00:09:43,020 --> 00:09:44,750
- He's way above you.
- Okay.

276
00:09:44,750 --> 00:09:46,990
Are you allowed to punish
those below you today?

277
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:49,020
- It didn't hurt my feelings.
- Of course not.

278
00:09:49,020 --> 00:09:50,570
- I just felt a little prick.
- Just a little prick.

279
00:09:50,700 --> 00:09:52,030
Which team should go first?

280
00:09:52,100 --> 00:09:54,070
- Should Team Actor go first?
- All right.

281
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:57,270
- We have some young members.
- They know many recent songs.

282
00:09:57,270 --> 00:09:59,450
- We choose 2010.
- 2010?

283
00:09:59,450 --> 00:10:01,810
You're to guess the number 1 song
of 2010.

284
00:10:01,810 --> 00:10:02,870
- The number 1 song?
- The number 1 song?

285
00:10:02,870 --> 00:10:04,480
- Of 2010?
- It's 10 years ago.

286
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:05,640
It's 2010.

287
00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:07,920
The number 2 song is
"Nagging" by IU and Seul Ong.

288
00:10:07,980 --> 00:10:09,380
- "Nagging".
- "Nagging".

289
00:10:09,460 --> 00:10:11,610
<i>- Every single thing I say
- Every single thing I say</i>

290
00:10:11,610 --> 00:10:13,690
<i>- Is for you</i>
- Ji Hyo.

291
00:10:13,690 --> 00:10:15,780
- Hey! Stop pretending you know it.
<i>- Even if you don't like it</i>

292
00:10:15,780 --> 00:10:18,150
<i>I have to say it</i>

293
00:10:18,150 --> 00:10:19,250
She got the lyrics completely wrong.

294
00:10:19,250 --> 00:10:20,970
<i>- Let's stop</i>
- It's a recent song for you, right?

295
00:10:21,020 --> 00:10:22,390
It's a recent song for her.

296
00:10:22,940 --> 00:10:25,470
- It's a recent song for her.
- Good job, Ji Hyo.

297
00:10:25,860 --> 00:10:28,530
- Say, "Let me answer."
- Okay.

298
00:10:29,310 --> 00:10:30,600
- Should we try it?
- I think it might be right.

299
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:32,340
- Let me answer.
- Rowoon.

300
00:10:32,340 --> 00:10:34,480
"Heartbeat" by 2PM.

301
00:10:34,580 --> 00:10:36,100
- That's wrong.
- "Heartbeat".

302
00:10:36,220 --> 00:10:37,350
<i>No matter how hard I try</i>

303
00:10:37,420 --> 00:10:39,370
- Let me answer.
- Let me answer.

304
00:10:39,880 --> 00:10:41,050
"Bo Peep Bo Peep" by T-ara.

305
00:10:41,640 --> 00:10:43,010
I think it's right.

306
00:10:43,010 --> 00:10:44,720
(Wrong)

307
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:46,730
Let me answer.
"Tell Me" by Wonder Girls.

308
00:10:47,250 --> 00:10:48,480
That's wrong.

309
00:10:48,590 --> 00:10:50,060
That's from 2008.

310
00:10:50,060 --> 00:10:51,250
- It is?
- Yes.

311
00:10:51,430 --> 00:10:53,670
- Let me answer.
- "Abracadabra"...

312
00:10:53,800 --> 00:10:54,800
by Brown Eyed Girls.

313
00:10:55,490 --> 00:10:57,230
(Wrong)

314
00:10:57,230 --> 00:10:59,500
I'll give you a hint.
It's a four-member girl group.

315
00:10:59,500 --> 00:11:01,130
- Let me answer!
- Let me answer!

316
00:11:01,130 --> 00:11:02,900
- "4Minute" by 4Minute.
- That's right.

317
00:11:03,100 --> 00:11:04,210
- No?
- 4Minute!

318
00:11:04,210 --> 00:11:05,730
"Hot Issue" by 4Minute.

319
00:11:05,840 --> 00:11:07,600
- I don't think it's 4Minute.
- I think it's right.

320
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:08,850
It's not 4Minute.

321
00:11:08,980 --> 00:11:10,510
- Here's another hint.
- Okay.

322
00:11:11,110 --> 00:11:12,920
You haven't even mentioned
this girl group yet.

323
00:11:12,920 --> 00:11:14,820
(It's a 4-member girl group
that hasn't been mentioned.)

324
00:11:14,820 --> 00:11:16,780
- No?
- Really? A four-member girl group?

325
00:11:17,060 --> 00:11:19,420
The number one song is by
a girl group we haven't mentioned?

326
00:11:19,620 --> 00:11:21,230
Who else was popular?

327
00:11:21,230 --> 00:11:22,560
And it's the number one song?

328
00:11:22,750 --> 00:11:24,650
Jewelry... Let me answer!

329
00:11:24,650 --> 00:11:26,100
"I Really Like You" by Jewelry.

330
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:28,170
(That's from 2003.)

331
00:11:28,170 --> 00:11:29,300
That's from way back.

332
00:11:29,330 --> 00:11:30,600
- Gosh, don't do anything.
- Come on!

333
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:32,070
<i>I really like you</i>

334
00:11:32,700 --> 00:11:33,730
It's not that song?

335
00:11:33,940 --> 00:11:36,900
- Why not?
- Please don't mention Bunny Girls.

336
00:11:36,980 --> 00:11:39,270
- How can we not remember it?
- But you'll recognize the song.

337
00:11:39,640 --> 00:11:41,500
I'm sure they came
on Running Man too.

338
00:11:41,500 --> 00:11:42,680
- Right.
- Of course.

339
00:11:42,680 --> 00:11:44,270
- If they did...
- I know!

340
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:47,010
- What is it?
- Miss A.

341
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:50,060
It's that song.

342
00:11:50,060 --> 00:11:51,350
- Miss A!
- Miss A!

343
00:11:51,350 --> 00:11:53,620
(The hyenas smell something.)

344
00:11:53,620 --> 00:11:54,960
(Rowoon starts dancing.)

345
00:11:54,960 --> 00:11:57,100
- 5, 4, 3, 2, 1.
- "Good Girl, Bad Girl".

346
00:11:57,390 --> 00:11:59,730
- Let me answer!
- Let me answer!

347
00:11:59,730 --> 00:12:01,330
It's a Miss A song.

348
00:12:01,330 --> 00:12:03,100
- "Bad Girl, Good Girl."
- "Bad Girl, Good Girl."

349
00:12:03,630 --> 00:12:05,390
(Correct)

350
00:12:05,630 --> 00:12:06,840
Isn't that what we said?

351
00:12:07,130 --> 00:12:08,630
- I even danced.
- We got it backward?

352
00:12:08,630 --> 00:12:10,030
- We said, "Good Girl, Bad Girl."
- I even danced.

353
00:12:10,840 --> 00:12:12,580
We said, "Good Girl, Bad Girl."

354
00:12:13,770 --> 00:12:15,350
I just want to sing.

355
00:12:15,350 --> 00:12:18,740
<i>- A good girl on the outside
- A bad girl on the inside</i>

356
00:12:19,010 --> 00:12:21,350
- Can we dance?
- No, we can't.

357
00:12:21,350 --> 00:12:23,320
("Bad Girl, Good Girl",
The number 1 song of 2010)

358
00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:24,610
JYP.

359
00:12:25,480 --> 00:12:28,650
(They get an additional point
if they get more than 90 points.)

360
00:12:29,230 --> 00:12:31,650
(They do the dance moves too.)

361
00:12:31,700 --> 00:12:34,990
<i>- So shut up, boy
- So shut up, boy</i>

362
00:12:38,170 --> 00:12:40,600
(Jin Young shows off
her singing skills.)

363
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:42,670
Yes!

364
00:12:42,860 --> 00:12:44,340
Nice!

365
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:48,480
(Yes!)

366
00:12:49,870 --> 00:12:52,420
(She doesn't know
the melody or the beat.)

367
00:12:52,850 --> 00:12:55,220
She doesn't know that song.
She's clueless.

368
00:12:55,220 --> 00:12:57,460
- Why aren't you singing the song?
- She's the Suzy in our group.

369
00:12:57,460 --> 00:12:58,590
- Why aren't you singing the song?
- I don't know it.

370
00:12:58,720 --> 00:12:59,960
I don't know the song.

371
00:13:01,460 --> 00:13:03,960
(Thanks to Jin Young,
they successfully sing the song.)

372
00:13:03,960 --> 00:13:04,990
- Well?
- What's the score?

373
00:13:04,990 --> 00:13:06,830
- What's the score?
- You sang out your heart.

374
00:13:06,830 --> 00:13:08,700
(90 points or over
will give them an extra point.)

375
00:13:08,700 --> 00:13:10,130
(What's Jin Young's score?)

376
00:13:10,130 --> 00:13:11,260
You did great.

377
00:13:13,730 --> 00:13:15,600
What a relief. It's not over 90.

378
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:17,340
Hey, it's you on the screen.

379
00:13:18,180 --> 00:13:19,900
- It's not over 90.
- It's you, Jin Young.

380
00:13:19,900 --> 00:13:22,100
No way. Did you see that?

381
00:13:22,100 --> 00:13:24,110
I can't believe
she only scored 89 points.

382
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:26,780
Jin Young, that was amazing though.

383
00:13:27,050 --> 00:13:28,240
Good job, Jin Young.

384
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:29,610
Let's go next.

385
00:13:29,610 --> 00:13:31,190
That was so close.

386
00:13:31,190 --> 00:13:34,750
We guessed the artist correctly.
The song was a huge hit.

387
00:13:34,750 --> 00:13:36,930
I was serving in the military
at the time,

388
00:13:36,930 --> 00:13:38,800
so all the soldiers
sang along to this song.

389
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:41,760
"Bad girl! Good girl!"

390
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:43,230
We all went crazy.

391
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:45,700
- You're wearing the military color.
- You're right.

392
00:13:45,700 --> 00:13:48,100
- We all are.
- Sae Ho, what were you up to?

393
00:13:48,100 --> 00:13:49,710
I was doing well, I guess.

394
00:13:49,710 --> 00:13:50,730
(Sae Ho ends the conversation.)

395
00:13:51,100 --> 00:13:52,770
(What...)

396
00:13:53,210 --> 00:13:54,480
What kind of an answer
did you want from me?

397
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:55,710
- I can't make it up?
- You're asking him that?

398
00:13:55,710 --> 00:13:57,980
- Just look at his expression.
- What were you up to back then?

399
00:13:58,450 --> 00:13:59,640
Guys, gather around.

400
00:13:59,640 --> 00:14:01,510
(Team Comedian gather.)

401
00:14:01,820 --> 00:14:03,820
Did you have to open your big mouth?

402
00:14:03,820 --> 00:14:05,690
- I only answered a question.
- Sae Ho, you were wrong.

403
00:14:05,690 --> 00:14:07,780
- What...
- Just keep your mouth shut.

404
00:14:07,780 --> 00:14:10,060
Always answer questions
to the best of your ability.

405
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:12,230
- It's all I ask.
- Hands behind you.

406
00:14:12,230 --> 00:14:13,600
- There's no need for that.
- Is that so?

407
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:15,890
Jae Suk doesn't like that,
you know.

408
00:14:15,890 --> 00:14:17,170
- What...
- We can stand freely.

409
00:14:17,170 --> 00:14:19,710
- Suk Jin.
- What? What should I do?

410
00:14:19,710 --> 00:14:21,230
- Our junior comedians are watching,
- I see.

411
00:14:21,230 --> 00:14:23,340
so I'd appreciate
courtesy and respect.

412
00:14:23,340 --> 00:14:24,600
Let's do a good job, okay?

413
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:26,000
- Think before you talk.
- We've got this.

414
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,000
- Sure.
- Got it.

415
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,240
- So we can ask...
- Let's brings it in.

416
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:30,140
- On 3. 1, 2, 3. Let's go.
- Let's go!

417
00:14:30,140 --> 00:14:32,870
- That was quite nice to see.
- That was nice of you, Jae Suk.

418
00:14:32,870 --> 00:14:35,480
It's all about seniors and juniors
coming together today.

419
00:14:35,480 --> 00:14:36,920
- Please choose a year.
- We're up.

420
00:14:36,920 --> 00:14:38,590
- How about 1985?
- What?

421
00:14:38,590 --> 00:14:40,230
- 1985.
- But I was born in 1986.

422
00:14:40,230 --> 00:14:41,380
1985...

423
00:14:41,380 --> 00:14:44,020
Can you be more considerate?
I was born in 1986.

424
00:14:44,020 --> 00:14:45,520
Let's try 1985.

425
00:14:45,520 --> 00:14:47,620
- Can you guess it right?
- I know I can.

426
00:14:47,620 --> 00:14:50,360
- But there's also Sa Yeon.
- Sa Yeon will know it too.

427
00:14:50,360 --> 00:14:52,390
We'll go with the year 2000.

428
00:14:52,390 --> 00:14:54,810
- Who are you to decide that?
- Hold on.

429
00:14:54,810 --> 00:14:56,600
- Wait.
- 1985...

430
00:14:56,600 --> 00:14:58,900
Suk Jin, watch what you're saying!

431
00:14:58,900 --> 00:15:01,480
- Gather around.
- Aren't you ringing it too often?

432
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:03,420
- Is this a dictatorship?
- Hold on a second.

433
00:15:03,420 --> 00:15:05,450
- A dictator?
- I wanted the year 1985.

434
00:15:05,450 --> 00:15:07,550
- But this...
- I mentioned the year 1985.

435
00:15:07,550 --> 00:15:08,780
But this...

436
00:15:08,780 --> 00:15:11,880
We should go with a year
that is comfortable for everyone.

437
00:15:11,880 --> 00:15:14,480
Then you should've
discussed it with us...

438
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:16,380
instead of just announcing it.

439
00:15:16,380 --> 00:15:18,490
- Isn't the year 2000 the best?
- It's perfect.

440
00:15:18,490 --> 00:15:20,730
(An unconditional reflex)

441
00:15:20,730 --> 00:15:21,970
I prefer the year 2000 too.

442
00:15:21,970 --> 00:15:22,970
- You rats.
- What?

443
00:15:22,970 --> 00:15:24,630
- All right then.
- I can't believe you two.

444
00:15:24,630 --> 00:15:26,970
- On 3. 1, 2, 3. Let's go.
- 1, 2, 3, let's go.

445
00:15:26,970 --> 00:15:28,260
The year 2000.

446
00:15:28,260 --> 00:15:29,670
- The year 2000.
- That was nice teamwork.

447
00:15:29,670 --> 00:15:31,630
- The year 2000.
- The year 2000!

448
00:15:31,630 --> 00:15:33,900
You must guess the song
that came in third place.

449
00:15:33,900 --> 00:15:35,000
- 3rd place?
- The song in 3rd place?

450
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,770
Can you at least tell us the genre?

451
00:15:36,770 --> 00:15:38,770
- It's an upbeat dance number.
- A dance number?

452
00:15:38,770 --> 00:15:40,690
Let me answer!
"Festival" by Uhm Jung Hwa.

453
00:15:40,690 --> 00:15:42,050
- I think that's right.
- Let me answer.

454
00:15:42,380 --> 00:15:44,280
"The Way This Guy Lives"
by SECHSKIES.

455
00:15:44,610 --> 00:15:46,150
Let me answer.
"Don't Know" by Uhm Jung Hwa.

456
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:48,120
Let me answer.
"In the Bus" by ZaZa.

457
00:15:50,060 --> 00:15:51,960
Seriously?

458
00:15:51,960 --> 00:15:54,260
- Why? He said it's upbeat.
- I like that song too but...

459
00:15:54,260 --> 00:15:56,390
- That was released in the 90s.
- He said it was upbeat.

460
00:15:56,390 --> 00:15:59,260
"Achilantis" by BoA.

461
00:16:00,070 --> 00:16:01,810
- What was that?
- What did he say?

462
00:16:01,810 --> 00:16:03,340
Unbelievable.

463
00:16:03,340 --> 00:16:05,180
Are you kidding me?

464
00:16:05,180 --> 00:16:06,900
- Just keep your mouth shut.
- Sae Ho!

465
00:16:06,900 --> 00:16:09,850
Guys, please think about
what you're saying before saying it.

466
00:16:10,180 --> 00:16:11,950
All right? Now, bring it in.

467
00:16:11,950 --> 00:16:13,320
- 1, 2, 3, let's go.
- Let's go.

468
00:16:13,320 --> 00:16:14,610
- But...
- You two.

469
00:16:14,610 --> 00:16:16,650
Don't bother
addressing them yourself.

470
00:16:16,650 --> 00:16:18,090
- I have seniority here.
- You two,

471
00:16:18,090 --> 00:16:19,780
- don't make me stand up again.
- That's enough.

472
00:16:21,020 --> 00:16:22,430
(Upsetting)

473
00:16:22,430 --> 00:16:23,430
Here's a hint for you.

474
00:16:27,520 --> 00:16:29,120
(Could this be it?)

475
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:30,760
- Let me answer!
- Go for it.

476
00:16:30,760 --> 00:16:31,800
Let me answer.

477
00:16:32,730 --> 00:16:35,360
"Dances with DOC" by DJ DOC.

478
00:16:35,810 --> 00:16:38,030
("Dances with DOC" by DJ DOC)

479
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:40,600
Let me answer.
"Run to You" by DJ DOC.

480
00:16:41,140 --> 00:16:44,580
("Run to You" by DJ DOC is correct.)

481
00:16:45,140 --> 00:16:46,140
(What a bummer.)

482
00:16:46,140 --> 00:16:47,550
It was "Run to You."

483
00:16:49,420 --> 00:16:51,220
- No way.
- Come on!

484
00:16:51,220 --> 00:16:52,510
Go for it.

485
00:16:52,820 --> 00:16:54,280
Jump, jump!

486
00:16:54,380 --> 00:16:56,120
I'll show you how it's sung.

487
00:17:04,200 --> 00:17:07,570
<i>Bounce with me, bounce with me
Bounce with me, bounce</i>

488
00:17:08,340 --> 00:17:09,500
(Kwang Soo's bouncing
close to the floor.)

489
00:17:09,500 --> 00:17:11,610
What on earth are you doing?

490
00:17:11,610 --> 00:17:13,270
I can't dance properly yet.

491
00:17:22,690 --> 00:17:23,750
He's really good

492
00:17:23,750 --> 00:17:24,860
(He's really good.)

493
00:17:24,860 --> 00:17:26,190
He's a singer, after all.

494
00:17:26,190 --> 00:17:27,550
So this was the song.

495
00:17:27,550 --> 00:17:29,390
(Jong Kook's singing
hits our eardrums.)

496
00:17:29,390 --> 00:17:31,400
(Se Chan's lip-syncing
attacks our eyes.)

497
00:17:37,030 --> 00:17:39,370
(He expresses his comedic side
by lip-syncing.)

498
00:17:39,370 --> 00:17:40,870
Go, Jong Kook!

499
00:17:47,040 --> 00:17:48,880
(What score
did singer Jong Kook get?)

500
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:50,010
What did he get?

501
00:17:57,120 --> 00:18:01,460
(It's 91,
so they get 2 extra points.)

502
00:18:01,460 --> 00:18:03,050
Nice one!

503
00:18:03,050 --> 00:18:04,750
- All right.
- Nice!

504
00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:06,130
(Only Team Singer has three points.)

505
00:18:06,130 --> 00:18:08,170
(Team Singer is able
to take a strong lead.)

506
00:18:08,430 --> 00:18:10,730
- Team Singer is at an advantage.
- Right.

507
00:18:10,900 --> 00:18:12,560
- We keep getting the titles wrong.
- That's two in a row.

508
00:18:12,970 --> 00:18:14,110
We want to sing too, you know.

509
00:18:14,110 --> 00:18:16,530
We want to show you
how well comedians can party.

510
00:18:16,530 --> 00:18:18,530
- Unbelievable.
- We don't get chances like this.

511
00:18:18,530 --> 00:18:20,240
- We'll hold on to the mikes.
- Right.

512
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:22,480
- It'll be ours anyway.
- Let's try to sing a song too.

513
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:25,380
- Team Actor, choose a year.
- We'll go with 2008.

514
00:18:25,620 --> 00:18:27,190
You must guess the song
in first place.

515
00:18:27,190 --> 00:18:29,580
Why don't each team
come up with one answer each?

516
00:18:29,580 --> 00:18:31,460
That's a good idea.
I love the way you run your show.

517
00:18:32,750 --> 00:18:35,430
- Why are you kissing up to him?
- It's because I know him.

518
00:18:35,580 --> 00:18:36,630
Hold on a second. We're sorry.

519
00:18:36,630 --> 00:18:38,550
- But...
- Jae Suk, tell him.

520
00:18:38,550 --> 00:18:41,320
I won't say who it is,
but one of you...

521
00:18:41,430 --> 00:18:43,590
has been evaluating
the performance of others.

522
00:18:44,370 --> 00:18:46,530
- That's not nice at all.
- I thought it was a nice idea.

523
00:18:46,530 --> 00:18:47,830
And Suk Jin,

524
00:18:47,830 --> 00:18:50,570
don't tell others that
their guesses are absurd.

525
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,030
- But...
- I'd like him to dance too...

526
00:18:53,030 --> 00:18:54,910
when we're dancing together.

527
00:18:54,910 --> 00:18:56,840
- Also...
- But...

528
00:18:56,840 --> 00:18:58,540
- You're not setting an example.
- Hold on.

529
00:18:58,540 --> 00:19:00,720
(Second-in-command Suk Jin
gathers the other two.)

530
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:03,220
Jae Suk can say that, but not you.

531
00:19:03,220 --> 00:19:06,510
- Guys, sit down.
- Sure.

532
00:19:08,280 --> 00:19:09,860
I'm sorry about that.

533
00:19:09,860 --> 00:19:11,430
- I was going to answer but...
- That's enough.

534
00:19:11,430 --> 00:19:12,730
There's no need.

535
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:14,520
I need to quickly buy
some extra years.

536
00:19:14,520 --> 00:19:16,200
- You can buy some right now.
- I can't say anything.

537
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:17,470
You can buy some.

538
00:19:17,470 --> 00:19:19,530
Can I? But I'll wait for now.

539
00:19:20,500 --> 00:19:23,000
Here's a hint for you.
It's a girl group.

540
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:24,610
A girl group?

541
00:19:24,610 --> 00:19:25,830
"So Hot" by Wonder Girls?

542
00:19:26,180 --> 00:19:27,210
Good one!

543
00:19:27,210 --> 00:19:29,710
Let me answer.
"So Hot" by Wonder Girls.

544
00:19:30,040 --> 00:19:31,920
(That is correct!)

545
00:19:33,580 --> 00:19:34,580
(Finally, we got it right!)

546
00:19:34,580 --> 00:19:35,920
How on earth did you know?

547
00:19:35,920 --> 00:19:38,080
- Nice.
- Good job, Do Hyun.

548
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:40,780
(He couldn't be more touched.)

549
00:19:40,780 --> 00:19:42,320
It was "So Hot."

550
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:43,590
"So Hot".

551
00:19:44,050 --> 00:19:46,630
Ji Hyo had an advantage
since 2008 is recent for her.

552
00:19:46,630 --> 00:19:48,430
Don't be absurd.

553
00:19:48,430 --> 00:19:50,370
- This is a song I really like.
- JYP.

554
00:19:50,370 --> 00:19:52,030
Ji Hyo's a fan of Wonder Girls.

555
00:19:52,970 --> 00:19:54,560
- Ji Hyo knows this song.
- Isn't this it?

556
00:19:54,760 --> 00:19:56,060
JYP.

557
00:19:56,060 --> 00:19:57,110
You know it too.

558
00:19:57,110 --> 00:19:58,110
(They're already feeling the heat.)

559
00:19:58,110 --> 00:19:59,270
- Wonder Girls.
- Wonder Girls.

560
00:19:59,830 --> 00:20:00,910
- We're back!
- We're back!

561
00:20:05,150 --> 00:20:07,740
(After limply swaying his body)

562
00:20:08,150 --> 00:20:09,220
Who on earth
sings like that in Wonder Girls?

563
00:20:10,460 --> 00:20:14,130
(Kwang Soo sounds like a mosquito.)

564
00:20:16,460 --> 00:20:19,790
(Their version of "So Hot"
seems slightly off though.)

565
00:20:19,790 --> 00:20:21,630
(Is this right?)

566
00:20:23,370 --> 00:20:25,790
(What score did Ji Hyo
get for her team?)

567
00:20:25,790 --> 00:20:27,260
- What's her score?
- Probably 35.

568
00:20:27,670 --> 00:20:29,670
I bet she scored below 50.

569
00:20:30,980 --> 00:20:32,000
- Look.
- Seriously?

570
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:33,610
(She received a higher score
than predicted.)

571
00:20:33,800 --> 00:20:35,040
- Look.
- Seriously?

572
00:20:35,040 --> 00:20:36,880
- We get two extra points.
- It's all about being loud.

573
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:38,510
- You need to sing loudly.
- This is absurd.

574
00:20:38,510 --> 00:20:39,840
Are you kidding me?

575
00:20:39,950 --> 00:20:41,690
When they were singing just now,

576
00:20:41,690 --> 00:20:43,960
Jin Young couldn't take her eyes
off Rowoon.

577
00:20:43,960 --> 00:20:45,580
Don't tell people that!

578
00:20:45,580 --> 00:20:47,250
- Why not?
- When did I look at him?

579
00:20:47,250 --> 00:20:48,660
- She kept on staring at him.
- I didn't.

580
00:20:48,660 --> 00:20:50,250
- It was too obvious.
- I didn't look at him.

581
00:20:50,250 --> 00:20:51,700
Rewind and check.
Jin Young was like this.

582
00:20:51,700 --> 00:20:52,960
(Rewind and check.
Jin Young was like this.)

583
00:20:54,060 --> 00:20:57,400
(While Team Actor was singing)

584
00:21:01,910 --> 00:21:03,330
- Unbelievable.
- She didn't even hide it.

585
00:21:03,330 --> 00:21:04,730
- I didn't look at him.
- Even I saw it.

586
00:21:04,730 --> 00:21:06,410
- But I didn't.
- Is he like Won Bin to you?

587
00:21:06,410 --> 00:21:07,540
- Still...
- Shut it!

588
00:21:07,540 --> 00:21:10,920
The moment she got caught,
she put her arm around Jong Kook.

589
00:21:11,540 --> 00:21:12,980
- I saw it.
- No way.

590
00:21:12,980 --> 00:21:14,920
It's fine though. I understand.

591
00:21:15,390 --> 00:21:18,960
I'm sorry, but aren't comedians
usually loud and active?

592
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:21,690
- We've been doing poorly.
- Our guesses have been way off.

593
00:21:21,690 --> 00:21:23,020
How is it that you don't know
any of the songs?

594
00:21:23,020 --> 00:21:24,490
I think I know why.

595
00:21:24,490 --> 00:21:28,470
We never really think about
the songs when listening to them.

596
00:21:28,470 --> 00:21:31,990
- We're busy dancing.
- You're right.

597
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:33,230
Like this.

598
00:21:33,230 --> 00:21:34,760
(Dancing)

599
00:21:35,140 --> 00:21:36,880
Why do you all dance the same moves?

600
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:38,910
- We...
- Your dance was identical.

601
00:21:38,910 --> 00:21:40,300
- It's our basic move.
- We...

602
00:21:40,300 --> 00:21:42,450
- We don't memorize titles.
- No, we don't.

603
00:21:42,450 --> 00:21:44,740
- We just party.
- Yes, exactly.

604
00:21:44,740 --> 00:21:46,340
All we care about is standing out.

605
00:21:46,340 --> 00:21:47,980
- Then...
- Is it our turn now?

606
00:21:47,980 --> 00:21:50,690
Let's go with the year 1985
since Suk Jin's confident.

607
00:21:50,690 --> 00:21:52,120
I doubt Jong Kook knows...

608
00:21:52,120 --> 00:21:53,750
- songs from back then.
- It's a tough one.

609
00:21:53,750 --> 00:21:55,690
Sa Yeon's my only competition.

610
00:21:55,980 --> 00:21:57,900
- But...
- We choose the year 1985.

611
00:21:57,900 --> 00:21:58,990
You will guess the song...

612
00:21:59,590 --> 00:22:01,820
- in third place.
- It won't be easy then.

613
00:22:01,820 --> 00:22:03,790
- The year 1985...
- In 1985,

614
00:22:03,790 --> 00:22:04,870
the song in first place was...

615
00:22:04,870 --> 00:22:07,300
- "I Can Love Again" by Sunflower.
- Who?

616
00:22:07,300 --> 00:22:09,470
I don't quite remember that song.

617
00:22:09,710 --> 00:22:11,830
In second place was "Yesterday
Today and" by Cho Yong Pil.

618
00:22:13,140 --> 00:22:15,270
(It's a song I know!)

619
00:22:15,270 --> 00:22:17,680
(The older guys all chime in.)

620
00:22:17,680 --> 00:22:18,740
- Let me answer.
- Sure.

621
00:22:18,740 --> 00:22:20,420
- "Spark" by Cheon Young Rok.
- "Paper Crane".

622
00:22:20,420 --> 00:22:21,690
- "Paper Crane".
- "Spark".

623
00:22:21,780 --> 00:22:23,280
("Spark" is incorrect.)

624
00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:24,310
- Let me answer.
- Let me answer.

625
00:22:24,690 --> 00:22:27,630
- "Teahouse of the Winter"...
- By Cheon Young Rok.

626
00:22:27,630 --> 00:22:28,730
("Teahouse of the Winter"
is incorrect.)

627
00:22:28,730 --> 00:22:30,080
- Park Nam Jung...
- Lee Yong?

628
00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:31,430
- No.
- "Last Night in October".

629
00:22:31,430 --> 00:22:33,460
Lee Yong was popular
in the early 80s.

630
00:22:33,460 --> 00:22:35,490
- You're wrong.
- It was in the 80s.

631
00:22:35,560 --> 00:22:36,730
- Let me answer. Can I try?
- I know I'm right.

632
00:22:36,730 --> 00:22:39,060
- No. It's not Lee Yong.
- It is.

633
00:22:39,060 --> 00:22:40,500
"Last Night in October" by Lee Yong.

634
00:22:40,500 --> 00:22:42,470
Suk Jin's driving me crazy.

635
00:22:42,470 --> 00:22:44,910
- Lee Yong's...
- This is 100 percent wrong.

636
00:22:45,110 --> 00:22:46,570
"Seoul, Seoul, Seoul".

637
00:22:46,570 --> 00:22:48,210
- That's not even his song.
- Is that Lee Yong's song?

638
00:22:48,610 --> 00:22:50,310
I don't think I can be
on the same team as him.

639
00:22:50,340 --> 00:22:51,450
- Why?
- Come on.

640
00:22:51,570 --> 00:22:52,980
Goodness.

641
00:22:52,980 --> 00:22:54,690
He makes us assemble too many times.

642
00:22:54,690 --> 00:22:56,480
- Come on.
- Stop doing it.

643
00:22:56,480 --> 00:22:57,480
- Junior.
- What?

644
00:22:57,480 --> 00:22:59,050
I already told you.

645
00:22:59,050 --> 00:23:01,080
Lee Yong was from 1980 to 1981.

646
00:23:01,080 --> 00:23:02,980
- I'll buy it now.
- No wonder he gets scolded.

647
00:23:02,980 --> 00:23:04,590
How many years can he buy?

648
00:23:04,590 --> 00:23:05,790
- 5 years.
- He can buy 5 years?

649
00:23:05,790 --> 00:23:08,090
I'll buy. He's making me mad.

650
00:23:08,090 --> 00:23:09,630
- Okay.
- Oh, gosh.

651
00:23:09,630 --> 00:23:10,940
I want to do whatever I want.

652
00:23:10,940 --> 00:23:12,970
- How many years do I have?
- 33 years.

653
00:23:13,470 --> 00:23:15,870
- It was 1982.
- He didn't sing that year.

654
00:23:16,030 --> 00:23:17,680
- Na Hoon A?
- Right.

655
00:23:17,680 --> 00:23:20,180
- All right.
- Let me answer. Koo Chang...

656
00:23:20,680 --> 00:23:22,210
Mo's...

657
00:23:22,210 --> 00:23:25,480
There's that song by Koo Chang Mo.
That song...

658
00:23:25,480 --> 00:23:27,540
- That's not it.
- Please give her a second.

659
00:23:27,890 --> 00:23:28,890
- I have no clue.
- Let me answer.

660
00:23:28,890 --> 00:23:30,250
- "Heenari"...
- "Heenari".

661
00:23:30,250 --> 00:23:31,280
by Koo Chang Mo.

662
00:23:31,480 --> 00:23:33,250
("Heenari" by Koo Chang Mo
is correct.)

663
00:23:33,250 --> 00:23:34,690
See?

664
00:23:34,690 --> 00:23:36,630
We almost had it.

665
00:23:36,630 --> 00:23:37,860
(We almost had it.)

666
00:23:37,960 --> 00:23:39,520
Right, it's "Heenari."

667
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:40,900
"Heenari," right.

668
00:23:40,900 --> 00:23:42,370
- That was so close.
- "Heenari".

669
00:23:42,370 --> 00:23:43,790
"Heenari".

670
00:23:43,790 --> 00:23:46,670
"Heenari". I couldn't remember.

671
00:23:46,670 --> 00:23:47,760
Bring me the mic.

672
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:49,030
- What is it?
- Check, check.

673
00:23:49,030 --> 00:23:50,270
"Heenari" is playing.

674
00:23:50,270 --> 00:23:52,380
- "Heenari".
- This is "Heenari".

675
00:23:52,410 --> 00:23:53,680
- What is this song?
- Let's go for it.

676
00:23:53,680 --> 00:23:56,340
Hello, viewers.
Team Comedian is finally here.

677
00:23:56,340 --> 00:23:58,480
- Please give a round of applause.
- Nice to meet you.

678
00:23:58,480 --> 00:24:01,120
- "Heenari".
- You waited for a long time.

679
00:24:01,120 --> 00:24:03,040
- Written by me.
- Written by Choo Sae Ho.

680
00:24:03,040 --> 00:24:04,860
- Choo Sae Ho.
- Please play the music.

681
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:06,220
Like Cho Sae Ho.

682
00:24:06,390 --> 00:24:08,580
- What is this song?
- I really like this song.

683
00:24:08,580 --> 00:24:10,230
- "Heenari".
- "Heenari".

684
00:24:10,230 --> 00:24:12,290
(He's enthusiastic.)

685
00:24:12,490 --> 00:24:13,900
I'll buy some years.

686
00:24:13,900 --> 00:24:15,370
(Abruptly)

687
00:24:15,820 --> 00:24:17,200
- He's buying some years.
- I'll buy.

688
00:24:17,290 --> 00:24:18,870
- Why? Why are you buying?
- I'll buy.

689
00:24:18,870 --> 00:24:21,210
- I'm more senior than you.
- Hey, be quiet. Wait.

690
00:24:21,210 --> 00:24:23,060
Put your mic down.

691
00:24:23,140 --> 00:24:25,000
- What?
- Hey.

692
00:24:25,110 --> 00:24:26,180
Hold on.

693
00:24:27,210 --> 00:24:29,570
Give me your mic.
I'm more senior than you.

694
00:24:29,570 --> 00:24:30,740
- I'm your senior.
- I am!

695
00:24:30,740 --> 00:24:31,740
- I bought more years.
- Hey!

696
00:24:31,740 --> 00:24:33,570
You're watching a scene
where comedians are fighting.

697
00:24:33,570 --> 00:24:35,390
Did you buy more?

698
00:24:35,390 --> 00:24:38,860
(They try to sing
while the seniors fight.)

699
00:24:38,860 --> 00:24:39,890
What are you doing?

700
00:24:39,890 --> 00:24:41,320
(They get their microphones
confiscated.)

701
00:24:42,690 --> 00:24:44,320
(You have to give me the mic
so that I can sing.)

702
00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:46,230
Dance in the background.

703
00:24:46,230 --> 00:24:47,260
(3 microphones in 1 hand)

704
00:24:47,260 --> 00:24:49,170
- Like I have
- I'll buy.

705
00:24:49,170 --> 00:24:50,940
(I'll buy!)

706
00:24:51,560 --> 00:24:54,970
(Suk Jin reclaims number 1.)

707
00:24:55,970 --> 00:24:58,680
- I'll buy again.
- Junior.

708
00:25:00,070 --> 00:25:01,650
- What's going on?
- Stop it.

709
00:25:03,300 --> 00:25:06,380
(They're agitated by
the panic buying of years.)

710
00:25:07,690 --> 00:25:09,510
- Why did you
- Grab him.

711
00:25:09,720 --> 00:25:11,360
(They listen to Jae Suk
and collect his mic.)

712
00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:12,660
I bought more!

713
00:25:13,420 --> 00:25:16,690
(They used up
all their sticks for one song.)

714
00:25:17,230 --> 00:25:18,990
(I finally get to sing a line.)

715
00:25:21,430 --> 00:25:22,490
Bring it.

716
00:25:23,370 --> 00:25:24,940
(He collects all the microphones.)

717
00:25:24,940 --> 00:25:25,970
I bought more.

718
00:25:25,970 --> 00:25:26,970
- Again?
- I did.

719
00:25:26,970 --> 00:25:28,440
How many did you buy?

720
00:25:29,030 --> 00:25:30,570
(This is hilarious.)

721
00:25:31,830 --> 00:25:33,110
(He tries to sing,)

722
00:25:33,110 --> 00:25:35,570
(but Suk Jin steals the chorus.)

723
00:25:36,840 --> 00:25:40,040
- It's not your turn.
- The youngest can't do anything!

724
00:25:40,920 --> 00:25:41,950
Thank you.

725
00:25:41,950 --> 00:25:43,310
(The juniors finally take the mic.)

726
00:25:43,310 --> 00:25:44,310
(Last syllable)

727
00:25:45,510 --> 00:25:46,780
It's done.

728
00:25:47,890 --> 00:25:50,490
(Their job was to
clean up the song.)

729
00:25:51,160 --> 00:25:52,900
- What was this?
- Did they get over 90 percent?

730
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:54,590
You did well.

731
00:25:54,590 --> 00:25:55,970
- They got 98 percent.
- 98 percent.

732
00:25:56,200 --> 00:25:57,200
That makes no sense.

733
00:25:57,200 --> 00:26:00,260
I used up all the sticks,
and nothing changed.

734
00:26:00,500 --> 00:26:02,140
Jae Suk, you have 40 years.

735
00:26:02,140 --> 00:26:03,730
- 40 years, okay.
- Suk Jin has 38 years.

736
00:26:03,730 --> 00:26:05,330
That was a mess. What is this?

737
00:26:05,330 --> 00:26:06,830
- I have no power.
- And...

738
00:26:06,830 --> 00:26:08,500
- Hold on.
- Seniors.

739
00:26:08,500 --> 00:26:11,070
You can't steal my mic
while I'm singing.

740
00:26:11,070 --> 00:26:12,770
- I know.
- The senior is...

741
00:26:12,770 --> 00:26:14,690
supposed to go first.

742
00:26:14,690 --> 00:26:16,890
I was going to pass it on to you.

743
00:26:16,890 --> 00:26:18,890
- Why would you go first?
- Let's bring our hands together.

744
00:26:19,360 --> 00:26:20,360
I'll do it anyway.

745
00:26:20,360 --> 00:26:22,050
- 1, 2, 3. Let's go.
- 1, 2, 3.

746
00:26:22,190 --> 00:26:23,250
We got 98 percent.

747
00:26:23,250 --> 00:26:25,290
Each stick is worth five years.

748
00:26:25,290 --> 00:26:27,900
- I can't do anything.
<i>- Like I have a disease of the mind</i>

749
00:26:27,900 --> 00:26:29,630
(Sae Ho is still hyper.)

750
00:26:30,230 --> 00:26:33,290
(Is it the bell again?
Who is it now?)

751
00:26:34,140 --> 00:26:36,970
- Se Chan rang the bell.
- Yes, I rang it.

752
00:26:37,380 --> 00:26:39,270
- Go ahead.
- Hold on, Sae Ho.

753
00:26:39,300 --> 00:26:40,500
- What? Did he buy?
- He did.

754
00:26:40,500 --> 00:26:41,980
- Hold on.
- He bought some years.

755
00:26:41,980 --> 00:26:43,180
When did you buy?

756
00:26:44,840 --> 00:26:45,880
(A moment ago)

757
00:26:45,880 --> 00:26:47,070
(I'll buy 5 years.)

758
00:26:47,070 --> 00:26:48,420
- Did you buy?
- Yes.

759
00:26:48,420 --> 00:26:49,580
(Sae Ho was getting on my nerves.)

760
00:26:50,220 --> 00:26:52,280
Don't comedians have
a strict hierarchy?

761
00:26:52,280 --> 00:26:53,750
Why are you trying to stand out?

762
00:26:53,750 --> 00:26:55,390
- I am not.
- I can see it.

763
00:26:55,390 --> 00:26:57,700
- Why are you trying to stand out?
- He's trying to stand out.

764
00:26:58,130 --> 00:26:59,320
- I don't like your attitude.
- Actually,

765
00:26:59,320 --> 00:27:01,170
- Se Chan is making a good point.
- Why would you do that?

766
00:27:01,170 --> 00:27:03,760
Don't act that way.

767
00:27:03,760 --> 00:27:05,560
I'll pull your ears.

768
00:27:05,560 --> 00:27:06,760
- Okay.
- Understood?

769
00:27:06,760 --> 00:27:08,530
I've never seen somebody
get their ears yanked.

770
00:27:08,870 --> 00:27:09,970
Can you do better?

771
00:27:10,030 --> 00:27:11,210
Can you do better or not?

772
00:27:11,210 --> 00:27:13,030
- I can.
- Say, "I can do it" three times.

773
00:27:13,030 --> 00:27:14,210
I can do it. I can do it.
I can do it.

774
00:27:14,210 --> 00:27:15,740
Okay, go back to your seat.

775
00:27:15,770 --> 00:27:17,950
I gave a lesson to the junior.

776
00:27:17,950 --> 00:27:20,840
- Good job.
- Have a seat.

777
00:27:20,840 --> 00:27:21,980
- Good job.
- Sit.

778
00:27:21,980 --> 00:27:23,780
- This is necessary.
- Right.

779
00:27:23,780 --> 00:27:24,980
- I'll take this role.
- Good.

780
00:27:24,980 --> 00:27:26,360
- Somebody came...
- Stop it.

781
00:27:26,360 --> 00:27:28,580
- You're an important intermediary.
- I'll try my best.

782
00:27:28,580 --> 00:27:30,160
There's one question left.

783
00:27:30,160 --> 00:27:31,590
We pick 2015.

784
00:27:31,590 --> 00:27:33,090
- 2015.
- That's not too long ago.

785
00:27:33,090 --> 00:27:34,900
- Let's go.
- Guess the number one song.

786
00:27:34,900 --> 00:27:38,490
- Number one.
- "Loser" by BigBang was sixth.

787
00:27:38,730 --> 00:27:41,470
<i>- Loser, loner
- Loser, loner</i>

788
00:27:41,470 --> 00:27:43,940
This was a mega-hit song.

789
00:27:43,940 --> 00:27:46,210
Let's get this right.

790
00:27:46,210 --> 00:27:49,040
This was earlier. Let me answer.
"Growl" by EXO.

791
00:27:49,300 --> 00:27:50,810
- Let me answer!
- Let me answer!

792
00:27:50,950 --> 00:27:53,720
- "Gangnam Style" by PSY.
- "Gangnam Style".

793
00:27:54,620 --> 00:27:57,310
Hey, don't get too excited.

794
00:27:57,780 --> 00:27:59,310
Goodness.

795
00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:00,390
Let me answer.

796
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:01,960
- We didn't say anything.
- It's fine.

797
00:28:01,960 --> 00:28:02,980
- Try it.
- He's more senior.

798
00:28:02,980 --> 00:28:04,730
- Go.
- "Bang Bang Bang" by BigBang.

799
00:28:05,020 --> 00:28:06,590
("Bang Bang Bang" by BigBang
is correct.)

800
00:28:07,050 --> 00:28:09,060
(Team Comedian earns 1 point.)

801
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:12,940
How did you know?

802
00:28:12,940 --> 00:28:14,610
You punk.

803
00:28:14,610 --> 00:28:15,830
Let's get ready to shoot.

804
00:28:15,870 --> 00:28:17,270
Okay. Bring it.

805
00:28:17,270 --> 00:28:18,800
Here.

806
00:28:18,980 --> 00:28:20,610
- Jump.
- Mic.

807
00:28:23,650 --> 00:28:25,040
(He pretends like
he knows how to have fun.)

808
00:28:25,770 --> 00:28:28,740
(Warming up)

809
00:28:29,620 --> 00:28:32,120
(Cue the music!)

810
00:28:32,690 --> 00:28:34,690
(Creaking)

811
00:28:35,320 --> 00:28:37,080
(This semi-comedian wants to join.)

812
00:28:37,790 --> 00:28:39,990
(They all do their own thing.)

813
00:28:40,630 --> 00:28:42,260
(This is a mess.)

814
00:28:42,870 --> 00:28:45,030
(Let's have some fun.)

815
00:28:45,470 --> 00:28:46,830
- Jae Suk.
- Jae Suk.

816
00:28:47,090 --> 00:28:49,970
(The cool part is for Jae Suk
with the highest seniority.)

817
00:28:51,230 --> 00:28:52,610
(He chimes in.)

818
00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:54,570
(What is Suk Jin doing?)

819
00:28:55,040 --> 00:28:57,570
(This is how comedians have fun
in karaoke.)

820
00:28:59,620 --> 00:29:00,650
Here it is.

821
00:29:02,310 --> 00:29:04,860
(Their excitement is
about to explode!)

822
00:29:04,860 --> 00:29:06,010
Line up!

823
00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:08,690
(Get ready to fire.)

824
00:29:09,230 --> 00:29:10,700
<i>- Bang, bang, bang
- Bang, bang, bang</i>

825
00:29:12,200 --> 00:29:13,900
(Is he twirling a folk arts hat?)

826
00:29:14,700 --> 00:29:15,700
(Shoot, shoot, shoot)

827
00:29:16,370 --> 00:29:17,790
<i>- Bang, bang, bang
- Bang, bang, bang</i>

828
00:29:18,170 --> 00:29:19,530
<i>Shoot, shoot</i>

829
00:29:19,830 --> 00:29:22,330
(Their energy reaches the climax.)

830
00:29:23,760 --> 00:29:26,980
(They try so hard to stand out.)

831
00:29:28,150 --> 00:29:29,150
(Shoot, shoot, shoot)

832
00:29:30,840 --> 00:29:32,120
That was good.

833
00:29:32,120 --> 00:29:33,380
- We burned it up.
- Great job.

834
00:29:33,380 --> 00:29:34,950
We burned it up.
Let's get 100 percent.

835
00:29:35,190 --> 00:29:36,950
(This is their version in 2020.
What is their score?)

836
00:29:37,780 --> 00:29:39,360
(92 percent!)

837
00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:40,550
- Okay.
- Okay.

838
00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:42,080
That was great.

839
00:29:42,160 --> 00:29:43,860
I feel much better now.

840
00:29:44,090 --> 00:29:45,900
- Excellent.
- I feel liberated.

841
00:29:45,900 --> 00:29:47,050
Me too.

842
00:29:48,090 --> 00:29:49,900
This feels like we're at
a karaoke bar. It's fun.

843
00:29:49,900 --> 00:29:51,400
"Cheer Up" by TWICE.

844
00:29:51,400 --> 00:29:52,970
"Wrongful Encounter" by Kim Gun Mo.

845
00:29:52,970 --> 00:29:53,970
(Team Actor earns 2 points,
and Team Singer earns 1.)

846
00:29:54,830 --> 00:29:57,830
You're all tied,
so we'll do one final round.

847
00:29:57,830 --> 00:29:59,030
- Okay.
- All right.

848
00:29:59,030 --> 00:30:01,210
- Sure.
- Please guess 1st place for 1998.

849
00:30:01,210 --> 00:30:03,950
Second place was
"Breakup with Her" by Kim Hyun Jung.

850
00:30:04,510 --> 00:30:06,380
Third place was "Sorrow" by COOL.

851
00:30:06,980 --> 00:30:07,980
Let me answer.

852
00:30:08,150 --> 00:30:09,620
"We Are the Future"...

853
00:30:10,190 --> 00:30:11,550
Good one.

854
00:30:11,810 --> 00:30:12,960
by H.O.T.

855
00:30:14,050 --> 00:30:15,630
It's that period of time.
That's right.

856
00:30:15,780 --> 00:30:17,190
H.O.T and SECHSKIES.

857
00:30:17,190 --> 00:30:18,230
Let me answer.

858
00:30:19,090 --> 00:30:21,590
- "Ppuyo Ppuyo" by UP.
- What are you talking about?

859
00:30:21,590 --> 00:30:22,590
Let me answer.

860
00:30:22,630 --> 00:30:24,670
- Wait.
- What are you talking about?

861
00:30:24,670 --> 00:30:26,330
- Can't I give my opinion?
- Wait.

862
00:30:26,330 --> 00:30:28,110
- Hold on.
- Should I be criticized?

863
00:30:28,110 --> 00:30:29,500
- Cut it out.
- I could be wrong!

864
00:30:29,500 --> 00:30:32,800
- Cut it out.
- Cut it out.

865
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:34,540
- Cut it out.
- I'm not playing.

866
00:30:34,570 --> 00:30:36,040
You were supposed to
discuss it with us.

867
00:30:36,040 --> 00:30:37,620
"Ppuyo Ppuyo" is
number one in my heart.

868
00:30:37,620 --> 00:30:38,770
Hey, you.

869
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:40,890
- Kwang Soo can't do that.
- No...

870
00:30:40,890 --> 00:30:42,220
No...

871
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:43,690
- I can have an opinion.
- Hey.

872
00:30:43,690 --> 00:30:45,620
You have to discuss it with us.

873
00:30:45,620 --> 00:30:48,280
- I had an opinion.
- We lost our chance.

874
00:30:48,280 --> 00:30:50,190
- I thought of it.
- Sit down. Be quiet.

875
00:30:50,190 --> 00:30:51,360
Don't talk. Sit.

876
00:30:51,430 --> 00:30:53,400
- Be quiet.
- Wait, you...

877
00:30:53,400 --> 00:30:55,590
Be quiet. Sit.

878
00:30:55,590 --> 00:30:57,940
- Be quiet.
- They're laughing and watching me.

879
00:30:58,260 --> 00:31:00,140
We lost our chance because of you.

880
00:31:00,140 --> 00:31:01,470
(They lost discipline
because of Kwang Soo.)

881
00:31:01,470 --> 00:31:02,870
She almost slapped him.

882
00:31:03,670 --> 00:31:04,980
(Ringing)

883
00:31:04,980 --> 00:31:06,770
- It was Suk Jin.
- Stand up.

884
00:31:06,770 --> 00:31:08,340
- Stand up.
- Why?

885
00:31:08,340 --> 00:31:10,770
Why do you care
if she pinches his cheek?

886
00:31:10,770 --> 00:31:12,680
- Well, I...
- Why do you care about their team?

887
00:31:12,680 --> 00:31:14,620
I thought it would be fun.

888
00:31:14,620 --> 00:31:15,780
All right.

889
00:31:15,780 --> 00:31:17,240
- Act appropriately.
- Okay.

890
00:31:17,240 --> 00:31:18,510
- Sure.
- Act appropriately.

891
00:31:18,510 --> 00:31:20,620
- Okay.
- Act appropriately.

892
00:31:21,190 --> 00:31:22,750
Look away when he's scolding me.

893
00:31:22,860 --> 00:31:23,890
- Let me answer.
- Let me answer.

894
00:31:24,700 --> 00:31:26,730
Is this it? "Thorn Tree"...

895
00:31:27,900 --> 00:31:28,970
by Jo Sung Mo.

896
00:31:29,590 --> 00:31:30,790
("Thorn Tree" by Jo Sung Mo
is incorrect.)

897
00:31:31,290 --> 00:31:32,560
Oh, gosh.

898
00:31:33,970 --> 00:31:34,970
- Why?
- Sa Yeon.

899
00:31:34,970 --> 00:31:36,110
That was a genuine reaction.

900
00:31:36,110 --> 00:31:38,070
I heard a pelican.

901
00:31:38,070 --> 00:31:39,500
Oh, gosh.

902
00:31:39,730 --> 00:31:40,980
A pelican.

903
00:31:40,980 --> 00:31:42,040
Let me answer.

904
00:31:42,840 --> 00:31:44,310
Uhm Jung Hwa's...

905
00:31:44,310 --> 00:31:45,420
"Poison".

906
00:31:45,680 --> 00:31:47,220
"Poison" by Uhm Jung Hwa?

907
00:31:47,220 --> 00:31:48,740
("Poison" by Uhm Jung Hwa
is correct.)

908
00:31:49,510 --> 00:31:50,780
See?

909
00:31:51,010 --> 00:31:52,780
(Team Actor gets the last question
correct and wins!)

910
00:31:53,390 --> 00:31:54,980
(This is the class of the senior.)

911
00:31:54,980 --> 00:31:56,160
Did they come from behind?

912
00:31:56,160 --> 00:31:57,590
- They did.
- That's true.

913
00:31:57,590 --> 00:31:59,090
First place is Team Actor,

914
00:31:59,090 --> 00:32:00,630
2nd is Team Comedian,
and 3rd is Team Singer.

915
00:32:00,630 --> 00:32:02,970
- That's preposterous.
- That's preposterous.

916
00:32:02,970 --> 00:32:05,030
Following the ranks for Team Actor,

917
00:32:05,060 --> 00:32:07,870
Ji Hyo will get 8 sticks,
Kwang Soo will get 7,

918
00:32:07,870 --> 00:32:10,210
Rowoon will get 6,
and Do Hyun will get 5.

919
00:32:10,210 --> 00:32:11,480
(They get sticks according to
their seniority levels.)

920
00:32:11,480 --> 00:32:14,500
After Round One, here's the tally.

921
00:32:14,500 --> 00:32:15,500
(Current Number of Sticks
after Round 1)

922
00:32:15,500 --> 00:32:17,570
(Team Actor, Team Comedian,
Team Singer)

923
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:20,180
(The first mission is over.)

924
00:32:20,950 --> 00:32:22,840
I don't remember any songs.

925
00:32:22,840 --> 00:32:24,080
I know.

926
00:32:24,250 --> 00:32:26,580
I'm not here to work.
I laughed so hard.

927
00:32:26,580 --> 00:32:28,780
- I had a lot of fun.
- Because of him.

928
00:32:28,780 --> 00:32:29,890
- Because of Jae Suk.
- All right.

929
00:32:30,230 --> 00:32:33,360
This mission is called
Running Man Has Red Buttock.

930
00:32:33,360 --> 00:32:34,370
What's that?

931
00:32:34,370 --> 00:32:37,560
2 people from each team will play
for a total of 3 rounds.

932
00:32:37,900 --> 00:32:40,140
<i>Monkeys have red buttocks</i>

933
00:32:40,140 --> 00:32:43,940
That's the tune. You have to make
a sentence with the given keyword.

934
00:32:44,330 --> 00:32:47,070
The next person has to take the word
the previous person ended with...

935
00:32:47,070 --> 00:32:48,340
and create a new sentence.

936
00:32:48,340 --> 00:32:49,800
You have to be witty.

937
00:32:49,800 --> 00:32:52,240
Right.
But if the production crew thinks...

938
00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:54,340
- the sentence doesn't make sense...
- Then it counts as a failure.

939
00:32:54,340 --> 00:32:55,950
- Okay. We can do this.
- I'm good at this.

940
00:32:55,950 --> 00:32:57,240
We're like experts.

941
00:32:57,240 --> 00:32:58,780
Now we can have a real talk.

942
00:32:58,780 --> 00:33:00,280
We are specialists in this.

943
00:33:00,280 --> 00:33:02,360
- He's good at music and talk.
- He's an expert at it.

944
00:33:02,360 --> 00:33:05,520
He's good at games
about music and talk.

945
00:33:05,520 --> 00:33:07,700
- Sure. It's about music and talk.
- Music and talk.

946
00:33:07,930 --> 00:33:10,490
Now we need 6 people,
2 from each team.

947
00:33:10,490 --> 00:33:11,490
(2 people from each team go first.)

948
00:33:11,490 --> 00:33:12,560
- You should go first.
- Do you want to try?

949
00:33:12,560 --> 00:33:14,030
- You should go first.
- Can we do that?

950
00:33:14,090 --> 00:33:15,230
- Sure.
- You and I.

951
00:33:15,230 --> 00:33:16,640
- You two should go first.
- Okay. Let's go.

952
00:33:16,870 --> 00:33:18,880
- Sa Yeon, why don't you go first?
- Go ahead.

953
00:33:19,070 --> 00:33:20,480
- I'll do it with her.
- All right.

954
00:33:20,480 --> 00:33:21,740
- Okay.
- You two are a team.

955
00:33:22,300 --> 00:33:24,680
We have to win this game.

956
00:33:25,180 --> 00:33:26,240
Good luck.

957
00:33:26,270 --> 00:33:27,340
Let's win.

958
00:33:27,920 --> 00:33:29,280
Yang Saeroyi and Cho Saeroyi.

959
00:33:29,310 --> 00:33:30,480
Let's do this.

960
00:33:31,250 --> 00:33:32,510
(I'll show you what I got.)

961
00:33:32,510 --> 00:33:33,620
Ready.

962
00:33:33,720 --> 00:33:35,580
(What's the first word?)

963
00:33:35,580 --> 00:33:37,360
(Lee Kwang Soo)

964
00:33:37,360 --> 00:33:38,520
- It's easy.
- Hurry.

965
00:33:38,520 --> 00:33:39,590
Start.

966
00:33:39,590 --> 00:33:42,130
<i>Lee Kwang Soo's face is long</i>

967
00:33:42,630 --> 00:33:45,370
<i>What's long is a nose</i>

968
00:33:45,370 --> 00:33:46,560
- What?
- What was that?

969
00:33:46,560 --> 00:33:47,730
What are you talking about?

970
00:33:48,530 --> 00:33:50,640
(She sounds like she's singing
a Korean traditional song.)

971
00:33:50,640 --> 00:33:51,680
What was that?

972
00:33:51,680 --> 00:33:54,210
If you don't know
what to do, just say so.

973
00:33:54,210 --> 00:33:55,910
- This is unbelievable.
- What was that?

974
00:33:55,950 --> 00:33:58,180
- What are you doing?
- You should sing in tune.

975
00:33:58,180 --> 00:33:59,450
She doesn't even know the rules.

976
00:33:59,720 --> 00:34:02,510
- Was I singing off-tune?
<i>- Monkeys have red buttocks</i>

977
00:34:02,580 --> 00:34:05,360
<i>What's red is an apple,
an apple is delicious</i>

978
00:34:05,620 --> 00:34:07,960
- I see. Okay.
<i>- What's long is gimbap</i>

979
00:34:07,960 --> 00:34:08,960
- I see.
<i>- Gimbap is black</i>

980
00:34:08,960 --> 00:34:10,860
Now Sa Yeon goes first.

981
00:34:10,860 --> 00:34:12,050
- All right.
- Okay.

982
00:34:12,660 --> 00:34:13,690
Start.

983
00:34:14,590 --> 00:34:16,260
<i>Sa Yeon is pretty</i>

984
00:34:16,260 --> 00:34:17,740
<i>Who's pretty is Ji Hyo</i>

985
00:34:17,740 --> 00:34:19,300
<i>Ji Hyo is beautiful</i>

986
00:34:19,300 --> 00:34:20,960
<i>Who's beautiful is Sa Yeon</i>

987
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:22,530
<i>Sa Yeon is a singer</i>

988
00:34:22,530 --> 00:34:24,070
<i>A singer is good</i>

989
00:34:24,070 --> 00:34:25,780
<i>What's good is love</i>

990
00:34:25,780 --> 00:34:27,740
<i>Love is my girlfriend</i>

991
00:34:27,880 --> 00:34:29,240
<i>- What?
- What did he say?</i>

992
00:34:29,240 --> 00:34:30,440
<i>Love is my girlfriend</i>

993
00:34:30,440 --> 00:34:31,550
- What?
- What did he say?

994
00:34:31,880 --> 00:34:33,670
- What? What did you say?
- Are you seeing someone?

995
00:34:35,090 --> 00:34:36,510
(What did I just say?)

996
00:34:36,510 --> 00:34:38,150
- What?
- Who is it?

997
00:34:38,820 --> 00:34:40,760
- What was that?
- Hang on.

998
00:34:40,760 --> 00:34:42,230
- Hey.
- It still makes sense.

999
00:34:42,230 --> 00:34:43,380
It makes sense.

1000
00:34:43,380 --> 00:34:44,990
- It's just about love.
- Hey.

1001
00:34:44,990 --> 00:34:46,150
We will talk about it later.

1002
00:34:46,150 --> 00:34:47,550
Love is my girlfriend.

1003
00:34:47,920 --> 00:34:49,820
Why is he sending a video message
all of a sudden?

1004
00:34:50,630 --> 00:34:52,130
- Se Chan is seeing someone.
- You should tell us about her.

1005
00:34:52,130 --> 00:34:53,240
The word is girlfriend.

1006
00:34:53,300 --> 00:34:55,360
- Okay. Start.
- Start.

1007
00:34:55,610 --> 00:34:57,670
<i>My girlfriend is
Se Chan's girlfriend</i>

1008
00:34:57,900 --> 00:34:59,710
- What are you talking about?
- Hang on.

1009
00:34:59,710 --> 00:35:01,780
<i>My girlfriend is
Se Chan's girlfriend</i>

1010
00:35:02,280 --> 00:35:04,010
(It's like a crazy soap opera.)

1011
00:35:04,010 --> 00:35:05,650
This is strange. What was that?

1012
00:35:05,980 --> 00:35:07,170
- I'm sorry.
- Why did you say that?

1013
00:35:07,170 --> 00:35:08,210
That's not right.

1014
00:35:08,210 --> 00:35:09,780
Hey, what are you up to?

1015
00:35:10,010 --> 00:35:12,190
- Are you seeing my girlfriend?
- I'm really sorry.

1016
00:35:12,190 --> 00:35:13,460
How could you do that to Se Chan?

1017
00:35:13,460 --> 00:35:14,530
(She covers her mouth in shock.)

1018
00:35:14,530 --> 00:35:16,030
- What was that?
- How could you say that?

1019
00:35:18,360 --> 00:35:19,460
This is just...

1020
00:35:19,460 --> 00:35:20,920
He meant a female friend.

1021
00:35:21,190 --> 00:35:23,690
I'm friends
with Se Chan's girlfriend.

1022
00:35:23,690 --> 00:35:26,670
Do Hyun's friend is your girlfriend.

1023
00:35:26,670 --> 00:35:28,210
- She's his female friend.
- I see.

1024
00:35:28,210 --> 00:35:29,900
- My female friend.
- He meant a friend who's a girl.

1025
00:35:29,900 --> 00:35:31,780
- A friend who's a girl.
- Exactly.

1026
00:35:31,780 --> 00:35:33,340
- Okay.
- You should say a female friend.

1027
00:35:33,400 --> 00:35:34,510
It can be misleading.

1028
00:35:34,650 --> 00:35:36,880
(This drama is so fun.)

1029
00:35:38,320 --> 00:35:40,550
- Do Hyun just got minus one point.
- Okay.

1030
00:35:41,610 --> 00:35:43,320
- Do Hyun goes first?
- From Do Hyun.

1031
00:35:43,320 --> 00:35:44,780
The word is Cho Sae Ho. Start.

1032
00:35:45,880 --> 00:35:48,550
<i>Cho Sae Ho is a rock</i>

1033
00:35:49,150 --> 00:35:50,880
<i>Cho Sae Ho is a rock</i>

1034
00:35:50,880 --> 00:35:51,960
What?

1035
00:35:51,990 --> 00:35:53,420
- Hang on. I'm a rock?
- A rock?

1036
00:35:53,530 --> 00:35:55,630
Wait. This isn't right.

1037
00:35:55,630 --> 00:35:56,900
I meant his body.

1038
00:35:56,900 --> 00:35:58,840
That's what I mean.
He has a firm body.

1039
00:35:58,840 --> 00:36:00,240
- His body.
- No.

1040
00:36:00,300 --> 00:36:01,740
- Your body.
- I see. You mean my body.

1041
00:36:01,740 --> 00:36:04,170
- It's firm.
- Do you mean his head?

1042
00:36:04,210 --> 00:36:05,880
- Are you sure you meant his body?
- Seriously, that's what I meant.

1043
00:36:05,880 --> 00:36:07,240
- Are you sure?
- I meant his body.

1044
00:36:07,240 --> 00:36:09,710
- Sae Ho, he meant your body.
- I see.

1045
00:36:10,280 --> 00:36:11,510
Okay.

1046
00:36:11,650 --> 00:36:14,050
You should've said
Cho Sae Ho's arms are like a rock.

1047
00:36:14,420 --> 00:36:16,090
- I'm serious.
- His body is like a rock.

1048
00:36:16,090 --> 00:36:17,340
- Yes.
- Okay.

1049
00:36:17,340 --> 00:36:19,110
- Okay.
- It's so funny.

1050
00:36:19,590 --> 00:36:21,360
- You can't repeat the same thing.
- Start.

1051
00:36:21,360 --> 00:36:23,030
<i>Ji Suk Jin has a big nose</i>

1052
00:36:23,030 --> 00:36:24,630
<i>Who has a big nose is Lee Kwang Soo</i>

1053
00:36:24,630 --> 00:36:26,550
<i>Lee Kwang Soo is sick</i>

1054
00:36:26,550 --> 00:36:28,030
<i>Who's sick is Jeon So Min</i>

1055
00:36:28,090 --> 00:36:29,730
<i>Jeon So Min is Se Chan's girlfriend</i>

1056
00:36:30,690 --> 00:36:32,570
No, you should continue.

1057
00:36:33,070 --> 00:36:34,300
- Continue.
- That's true.

1058
00:36:34,840 --> 00:36:36,800
- Go ahead.
- It's true.

1059
00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:38,300
- Right.
- It's true.

1060
00:36:38,340 --> 00:36:40,780
That's not true.
Let's just continue.

1061
00:36:40,880 --> 00:36:43,150
<i>Se Chan's girlfriend is Jeon So Min</i>

1062
00:36:43,150 --> 00:36:44,920
Where is Jeon So Min?

1063
00:36:44,920 --> 00:36:47,150
- He asked a question.
- That doesn't count.

1064
00:36:47,480 --> 00:36:49,090
- Gosh, why are you so bad at this?
- That's not it.

1065
00:36:49,090 --> 00:36:50,240
It's music and talk.
What's wrong with you?

1066
00:36:50,240 --> 00:36:51,860
- You're not good at this.
- Hang on.

1067
00:36:51,860 --> 00:36:54,760
What they said before me...

1068
00:36:54,920 --> 00:36:56,460
- Round One is over.
- Okay.

1069
00:36:57,900 --> 00:37:00,730
Why do comedians have no wit?

1070
00:37:00,730 --> 00:37:02,460
Sae Ho, you're really bad.

1071
00:37:02,900 --> 00:37:03,990
You're terrible.

1072
00:37:03,990 --> 00:37:05,840
- Why is it so hard?
- I didn't do anything wrong.

1073
00:37:05,840 --> 00:37:07,070
Let me show you something.

1074
00:37:07,090 --> 00:37:08,300
Show them your wit.

1075
00:37:08,300 --> 00:37:09,710
Watch and learn.

1076
00:37:10,170 --> 00:37:11,570
Okay.

1077
00:37:11,570 --> 00:37:12,840
- Let's do this.
- All right.

1078
00:37:12,880 --> 00:37:14,030
Look what I do.

1079
00:37:14,070 --> 00:37:15,170
- Let's start.
- Watch.

1080
00:37:15,170 --> 00:37:16,300
- Start.
- This is easy.

1081
00:37:17,170 --> 00:37:18,940
<i>Cho Sae Ho is not funny</i>

1082
00:37:18,940 --> 00:37:20,780
<i>Who's not funny is Lee Kwang Soo</i>

1083
00:37:20,780 --> 00:37:22,490
<i>Lee Kwang Soo is cool</i>

1084
00:37:22,490 --> 00:37:25,110
<i>Who's cool is Rowoon</i>

1085
00:37:25,110 --> 00:37:26,710
<i>Rowoon is tall</i>

1086
00:37:26,710 --> 00:37:28,320
<i>Who's tall is Lee Kwang Soo</i>

1087
00:37:28,320 --> 00:37:30,150
<i>Lee Kwang Soo is ugly</i>

1088
00:37:30,150 --> 00:37:31,860
<i>Who's ugly is Yang Se Chan</i>

1089
00:37:31,860 --> 00:37:33,590
<i>Yang Se Chan is hideous</i>

1090
00:37:33,590 --> 00:37:35,260
<i>Who's hideous is Yang Se Chan</i>

1091
00:37:35,260 --> 00:37:37,670
<i>Yang Se Chan is...
No, this isn't right.</i>

1092
00:37:37,800 --> 00:37:38,840
She said the same thing.

1093
00:37:38,840 --> 00:37:40,990
I'm standing right here.
I'm very offended.

1094
00:37:41,170 --> 00:37:42,710
I'm standing right behind you.

1095
00:37:42,840 --> 00:37:44,880
It's like Sae Ho and I are
getting beaten out.

1096
00:37:45,070 --> 00:37:47,610
- Can you say good things about us?
- Am I hideous?

1097
00:37:47,840 --> 00:37:49,480
- All right.
- Good things.

1098
00:37:49,480 --> 00:37:51,710
- Let's be positive.
- Jin Young goes first.

1099
00:37:52,070 --> 00:37:53,670
- Ready.
- Let's do this.

1100
00:37:53,670 --> 00:37:54,820
Start.

1101
00:37:54,990 --> 00:37:57,050
<i>Haha is funny</i>

1102
00:37:57,050 --> 00:37:58,760
<i>Who's funny is Cho Sae Ho</i>

1103
00:37:58,760 --> 00:38:00,420
<i>Cho Sae Ho is fat</i>

1104
00:38:00,420 --> 00:38:02,090
<i>Who's fat is Kim Joon Hyun</i>

1105
00:38:02,090 --> 00:38:03,860
<i>Where is Kim Joon Hyun?</i>

1106
00:38:03,960 --> 00:38:06,230
- Okay.
- What?

1107
00:38:06,230 --> 00:38:08,320
(Where is Kim Joon Hyun?)

1108
00:38:08,320 --> 00:38:09,800
(He looks for a person
while playing a game.)

1109
00:38:09,800 --> 00:38:10,990
No. That doesn't count.

1110
00:38:11,130 --> 00:38:12,570
(Impressed by his wit)

1111
00:38:12,570 --> 00:38:14,190
Jae Suk, are you nervous?

1112
00:38:14,190 --> 00:38:15,530
Do you feel nervous
when you play this game?

1113
00:38:15,530 --> 00:38:16,840
- Are you nervous?
- Kim Joon Hyun eats a lot.

1114
00:38:16,860 --> 00:38:18,530
Why is he so bad at games?

1115
00:38:18,780 --> 00:38:20,570
- Are you feeling nervous?
- Is that what we do?

1116
00:38:20,570 --> 00:38:22,610
- Are you nervous? I'm asking you.
- No.

1117
00:38:22,610 --> 00:38:24,670
Look. I'm not nervous at all.

1118
00:38:25,010 --> 00:38:26,480
- Okay.
- Let's do this.

1119
00:38:28,050 --> 00:38:29,940
<i>Yang Se Chan has curly hair</i>

1120
00:38:29,940 --> 00:38:31,650
<i>Who has curly hair is Ji Suk Jin</i>

1121
00:38:31,650 --> 00:38:33,320
<i>Ji Suk Jin is weak</i>

1122
00:38:33,320 --> 00:38:35,490
<i>Who's weak is Yang Se Chan</i>

1123
00:38:35,650 --> 00:38:37,260
<i>Yang Se Chan has...</i>

1124
00:38:37,260 --> 00:38:39,820
<i>protruding teeth</i>

1125
00:38:40,460 --> 00:38:42,630
(Sudden oral acceleration)

1126
00:38:43,230 --> 00:38:45,570
- No. This doesn't count.
- He does have protruding teeth.

1127
00:38:45,570 --> 00:38:46,800
It was too late.

1128
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:48,570
It's true that
he has protruding teeth.

1129
00:38:49,130 --> 00:38:50,510
His mouth is protruding.

1130
00:38:50,570 --> 00:38:52,380
That's true. I do
have protruding teeth.

1131
00:38:52,380 --> 00:38:53,980
I didn't make that up.

1132
00:38:53,980 --> 00:38:56,900
- He has protruding teeth.
- That's true.

1133
00:38:56,900 --> 00:38:59,480
<i>If you have protruding teeth,
you need dentures</i>

1134
00:38:59,780 --> 00:39:01,490
<i>You go to the dentist for dentures</i>

1135
00:39:01,690 --> 00:39:03,490
<i>You go to the dentist
for a dental implant</i>

1136
00:39:03,490 --> 00:39:05,550
<i>Who needs a dental implant
is Yoo Jae Suk</i>

1137
00:39:05,550 --> 00:39:06,990
<i>Yoo Jae Suk is...</i>

1138
00:39:07,190 --> 00:39:08,420
<i>Where is he?</i>

1139
00:39:09,730 --> 00:39:10,960
Where is he?

1140
00:39:11,800 --> 00:39:13,590
Are you nervous?

1141
00:39:13,590 --> 00:39:14,900
Are you feeling nervous?
Is this driving you crazy?

1142
00:39:14,900 --> 00:39:16,090
Where's your wit?

1143
00:39:16,090 --> 00:39:17,900
(The nation's beloved MC feels
nervous when he plays games.)

1144
00:39:17,900 --> 00:39:19,440
- You're the worst.
- You can say Jae Suk is handsome.

1145
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:21,070
- My gosh. He's the worst.
- Jae Suk.

1146
00:39:21,070 --> 00:39:23,240
- What's so hard about it?
- Jae Suk has ugly teeth.

1147
00:39:23,360 --> 00:39:24,780
- You should say that.
- Stay still.

1148
00:39:24,780 --> 00:39:26,480
- Jae Suk has ugly teeth.
- My goodness.

1149
00:39:26,480 --> 00:39:28,380
- What do you want me to watch?
- Don't say anything.

1150
00:39:28,480 --> 00:39:30,380
He just said he'd show me something.

1151
00:39:30,380 --> 00:39:32,440
- Just stay still.
- What do you want me to see?

1152
00:39:32,440 --> 00:39:34,110
He sounded so nervous
when he said his answer.

1153
00:39:34,110 --> 00:39:35,190
"Where is he?"

1154
00:39:36,280 --> 00:39:38,460
Just relax. Take a deep breath.

1155
00:39:38,710 --> 00:39:40,590
- I'm sorry. I apologize.
- Where is his wit?

1156
00:39:40,590 --> 00:39:42,280
- Okay.
- You should've said,

1157
00:39:42,280 --> 00:39:44,460
"Yoo Jae Suk is a grasshopper."

1158
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:45,860
Rowoon goes first.

1159
00:39:45,860 --> 00:39:47,130
(Lee Do Hyun)

1160
00:39:47,590 --> 00:39:49,400
<i>Lee Do Hyun is an actor</i>

1161
00:39:49,400 --> 00:39:51,070
<i>Ji Hyo is also an actress</i>

1162
00:39:51,070 --> 00:39:52,690
<i>Ji Hyo is 40</i>

1163
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:53,990
<i>Who's 40 is...</i>

1164
00:39:53,990 --> 00:39:57,110
<i>I was 40 years old 10 years ago</i>

1165
00:39:57,110 --> 00:39:59,280
(He sings a trot song he made up.)

1166
00:40:00,030 --> 00:40:01,880
(They all burst into laughter.)

1167
00:40:02,940 --> 00:40:04,940
(Even the trot goddess has
never heard this song before.)

1168
00:40:04,940 --> 00:40:07,110
What's your problem?
What's wrong with you?

1169
00:40:07,480 --> 00:40:09,780
Why did you become so unwitty?

1170
00:40:09,780 --> 00:40:11,610
- What's gotten into you?
- What's wrong with you?

1171
00:40:11,650 --> 00:40:12,690
Why are you being like this?

1172
00:40:12,920 --> 00:40:14,650
- Stop it.
- Go home!

1173
00:40:14,650 --> 00:40:15,920
- Hey.
- He's...

1174
00:40:15,920 --> 00:40:19,320
- He's still nervous.
- Was it 10 years ago?

1175
00:40:19,420 --> 00:40:21,130
<i>10 years ago</i>

1176
00:40:21,130 --> 00:40:23,320
He always criticized Suk Jin.

1177
00:40:23,320 --> 00:40:25,460
Are you doing this on purpose?

1178
00:40:25,460 --> 00:40:26,900
- Are you doing it on purpose?
- Why would you say that?

1179
00:40:27,530 --> 00:40:30,440
You have no sense of wit.

1180
00:40:30,440 --> 00:40:32,280
- Is it a musical or what?
- We can make a song with it.

1181
00:40:32,280 --> 00:40:34,670
<i>- Was it 10 years ago?
- It was 10 years ago</i>

1182
00:40:34,670 --> 00:40:35,800
(The melody is quite catchy.)

1183
00:40:36,150 --> 00:40:37,780
- Let's begin again.
- All right.

1184
00:40:37,780 --> 00:40:38,820
Good luck.

1185
00:40:38,840 --> 00:40:39,920
(Suk Jin goes first)

1186
00:40:40,380 --> 00:40:41,490
Start.

1187
00:40:41,490 --> 00:40:43,110
<i>Rowoon is a model</i>

1188
00:40:43,110 --> 00:40:45,090
<i>Who's a model is Yoo Jae Suk</i>

1189
00:40:45,090 --> 00:40:46,920
<i>Yoo Jae Suk is tall</i>

1190
00:40:47,050 --> 00:40:49,230
<i>Who's tall is Han Ki Bum</i>

1191
00:40:49,320 --> 00:40:51,260
<i>Han Ki Bum is taller</i>

1192
00:40:51,260 --> 00:40:52,800
<i>What's taller is Mount Baekdu</i>

1193
00:40:52,860 --> 00:40:54,230
<i>Mount Baekdu...</i>

1194
00:40:55,860 --> 00:40:56,990
The air is nice there.

1195
00:40:58,300 --> 00:40:59,590
(He sounds like the honorary
ambassador of Mount Baekdu.)

1196
00:40:59,590 --> 00:41:00,630
What was that?

1197
00:41:01,070 --> 00:41:02,360
What are you talking about?

1198
00:41:02,360 --> 00:41:04,260
- What was that?
- You are disappointing.

1199
00:41:04,260 --> 00:41:06,610
- What's wrong with you two?
- Why can't you play games?

1200
00:41:06,610 --> 00:41:08,440
- What was that?
- Guys.

1201
00:41:08,440 --> 00:41:10,780
We need to gather them together.

1202
00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:12,070
- What's wrong with you?
- Hang on.

1203
00:41:12,070 --> 00:41:13,150
Come here.

1204
00:41:13,150 --> 00:41:15,240
- That's the best you can do?
- What was that?

1205
00:41:15,280 --> 00:41:16,590
Hey, you...

1206
00:41:16,590 --> 00:41:18,920
What did you say about Mount Baekdu?

1207
00:41:19,320 --> 00:41:20,690
That was very disappointing.

1208
00:41:20,860 --> 00:41:22,880
Shut it. Stay quiet.

1209
00:41:23,460 --> 00:41:25,550
- We better do well.
- Comedians are the worst.

1210
00:41:26,230 --> 00:41:27,320
Comedians are the worst here.

1211
00:41:27,920 --> 00:41:29,400
The second mission is over.

1212
00:41:29,690 --> 00:41:31,030
We tallied the points.

1213
00:41:31,800 --> 00:41:32,990
The winners are...

1214
00:41:33,840 --> 00:41:34,960
Team Singer.

1215
00:41:35,440 --> 00:41:37,300
I knew it. We did better
than we thought.

1216
00:41:37,300 --> 00:41:38,510
The second place is...

1217
00:41:38,530 --> 00:41:39,710
- It's us.
- Team Actor.

1218
00:41:39,710 --> 00:41:41,210
(2nd place, Team Actor)

1219
00:41:41,240 --> 00:41:42,570
Well done.

1220
00:41:42,570 --> 00:41:44,710
You gave more wrong answers
than the other teams put together.

1221
00:41:44,820 --> 00:41:45,840
Really?

1222
00:41:45,840 --> 00:41:46,980
We will reflect on ourselves.

1223
00:41:46,980 --> 00:41:48,440
(The second mission is over.)

1224
00:41:50,010 --> 00:41:51,650
- Do you want me to move over?
- I'll sit there.

1225
00:41:51,650 --> 00:41:52,920
(Where should I sit?)

1226
00:41:52,920 --> 00:41:54,150
- Sit over there.
- Where?

1227
00:41:54,150 --> 00:41:55,690
- Sit there.
- Here?

1228
00:41:55,690 --> 00:41:57,030
- Do you want me to sit here?
- Then I'll go there.

1229
00:41:57,030 --> 00:41:58,190
Okay. Let's do that.

1230
00:41:58,190 --> 00:41:59,730
(Obedient)

1231
00:42:00,030 --> 00:42:01,420
(While they sit together...)

1232
00:42:01,420 --> 00:42:03,320
We will move for about 10 minutes.

1233
00:42:03,320 --> 00:42:04,570
- This is the last race.
- Okay.

1234
00:42:04,690 --> 00:42:07,240
Jae Suk. Did anyone of you...

1235
00:42:07,240 --> 00:42:10,010
- get a mission or something today?
- No. Why?

1236
00:42:10,070 --> 00:42:12,940
I took a look at the sticks earlier.

1237
00:42:12,980 --> 00:42:14,670
- It said something.
- It had something on it.

1238
00:42:14,670 --> 00:42:16,380
I didn't know that
until Se Chan told me.

1239
00:42:17,070 --> 00:42:19,150
(The break after the second mission)

1240
00:42:19,150 --> 00:42:20,610
Gosh, there are a lot of sticks.

1241
00:42:20,980 --> 00:42:24,990
(He takes a look at the sticks
unintentionally.)

1242
00:42:26,510 --> 00:42:28,260
(What is this?)

1243
00:42:28,490 --> 00:42:32,400
Do we have other missions
or something today?

1244
00:42:32,530 --> 00:42:33,550
I don't know.

1245
00:42:33,550 --> 00:42:34,960
It says something on the sticks.

1246
00:42:34,960 --> 00:42:36,090
- What?
- What?

1247
00:42:36,690 --> 00:42:38,440
- What is that?
- What?

1248
00:42:38,590 --> 00:42:40,130
It says something here.

1249
00:42:40,130 --> 00:42:41,240
(It says something on the sticks.)

1250
00:42:41,240 --> 00:42:42,400
What is this?

1251
00:42:42,440 --> 00:42:43,860
It says spy.

1252
00:42:44,110 --> 00:42:45,710
I guess someone stamped it.

1253
00:42:45,710 --> 00:42:47,940
- Someone stamped it on my stick.
- Someone stamped it.

1254
00:42:47,940 --> 00:42:49,110
Something's going on.

1255
00:42:49,170 --> 00:42:52,740
Yes. The sticks had something red
stamped on them.

1256
00:42:52,740 --> 00:42:54,480
I couldn't really make out
what it said.

1257
00:42:55,510 --> 00:42:57,550
I think it read "spy."

1258
00:42:57,550 --> 00:42:58,650
(Is there a spy among them?)

1259
00:42:58,960 --> 00:43:00,490
Sae Ho looks a bit flustered.

1260
00:43:00,490 --> 00:43:01,880
- I think it read "spy."
- I'm not.

1261
00:43:02,630 --> 00:43:04,960
- There were three syllables.
- I have no idea about this.

1262
00:43:04,960 --> 00:43:06,920
I think it read "spy" in red.

1263
00:43:06,920 --> 00:43:08,400
Sae Ho, your lips are trembling.

1264
00:43:09,190 --> 00:43:10,420
I don't know anything about this.

1265
00:43:10,420 --> 00:43:12,690
Did you meet
the producer beforehand?

1266
00:43:12,690 --> 00:43:15,570
- Be honest.
- I met the writer in the morning.

1267
00:43:15,570 --> 00:43:17,630
She just told me
to make today's episode fun.

1268
00:43:17,630 --> 00:43:19,480
- Did she say anything else?
- Then why aren't you doing that?

1269
00:43:20,480 --> 00:43:22,010
(Jae Suk criticizes
his performance.)

1270
00:43:22,010 --> 00:43:23,800
- Come on, Sae Ho.
- I... Wait.

1271
00:43:23,800 --> 00:43:24,880
Why aren't you making this fun?

1272
00:43:24,880 --> 00:43:26,380
It feels weird for me to say this,

1273
00:43:26,380 --> 00:43:28,840
- but wasn't I funny enough?
- No.

1274
00:43:28,840 --> 00:43:30,050
It wasn't enough. We want more.

1275
00:43:30,050 --> 00:43:31,420
I think I did enough.

1276
00:43:32,150 --> 00:43:34,280
Not all the names
had "spy" written on them.

1277
00:43:34,420 --> 00:43:35,460
Only a few had it.

1278
00:43:35,460 --> 00:43:36,880
- What does the color red mean?
- I have nothing to do with this.

1279
00:43:36,880 --> 00:43:38,420
- Everyone.
- I didn't see any sticks.

1280
00:43:38,420 --> 00:43:39,860
To tell you the truth,

1281
00:43:39,860 --> 00:43:41,920
- there are spies, indeed.
- Are you serious?

1282
00:43:41,920 --> 00:43:42,920
(There are spies.)

1283
00:43:43,630 --> 00:43:45,940
(A big twist)

1284
00:43:45,940 --> 00:43:47,860
Every team has a spy.

1285
00:43:48,570 --> 00:43:50,840
There are more than three teams.

1286
00:43:50,900 --> 00:43:53,740
Including Team Spy,
there are four teams.

1287
00:43:53,880 --> 00:43:55,070
Really?

1288
00:43:55,070 --> 00:43:56,670
- So you're saying...
- So there are three spies in total.

1289
00:43:56,670 --> 00:43:58,380
- there are both team...
- Right.

1290
00:43:58,380 --> 00:43:59,420
and spy matches?

1291
00:43:59,420 --> 00:44:00,940
Right, there were a total
of four teams.

1292
00:44:00,940 --> 00:44:05,090
Throughout the missions
you've carried out so far,

1293
00:44:05,090 --> 00:44:07,190
the spies have stamped...

1294
00:44:07,190 --> 00:44:08,490
the sticks.

1295
00:44:08,490 --> 00:44:09,860
My gosh.

1296
00:44:09,860 --> 00:44:11,420
- Seriously?
- When did you see those sticks?

1297
00:44:11,420 --> 00:44:12,820
When did you see them?

1298
00:44:12,820 --> 00:44:14,690
- Hold on.
- When did you see them?

1299
00:44:14,690 --> 00:44:17,130
Some names aren't stamped.

1300
00:44:17,230 --> 00:44:18,740
Mine was red.

1301
00:44:18,740 --> 00:44:19,800
I didn't see any.

1302
00:44:19,800 --> 00:44:21,360
I didn't see anyone touching them.

1303
00:44:21,360 --> 00:44:23,030
The stamped sticks...

1304
00:44:23,030 --> 00:44:25,170
belong to the spies.

1305
00:44:25,630 --> 00:44:28,300
Your stamped sticks
will be taken away from you.

1306
00:44:28,550 --> 00:44:29,840
- Darn it. Who are the spies?
- We need to be careful.

1307
00:44:29,840 --> 00:44:31,300
- But...
- I just saw them.

1308
00:44:32,240 --> 00:44:35,440
If the spies have the most sticks
at the end of the race,

1309
00:44:35,440 --> 00:44:36,880
Team Spy wins.

1310
00:44:37,090 --> 00:44:38,920
If your team has more sticks
than them,

1311
00:44:39,190 --> 00:44:41,010
you win.

1312
00:44:41,010 --> 00:44:43,320
- We need to look out for them now.
- Our team is in the lead.

1313
00:44:43,490 --> 00:44:46,990
So that's why they didn't let us
touch the sticks.

1314
00:44:46,990 --> 00:44:48,320
Rowoon, why are you smiling?

1315
00:44:48,760 --> 00:44:50,800
- I smile all the time.
- But the spies are...

1316
00:44:50,800 --> 00:44:52,530
- You're suspicious.
- It's not me.

1317
00:44:52,530 --> 00:44:54,340
- Do the spies recognize each other?
- That means...

1318
00:44:54,340 --> 00:44:55,400
Se Chan isn't a spy.

1319
00:44:55,400 --> 00:44:56,460
- Because...
- Why not?

1320
00:44:56,460 --> 00:44:58,530
- He's the one who brought this up.
- If I'm a spy, then why would I?

1321
00:44:58,530 --> 00:44:59,740
- It could be intentional.
- No.

1322
00:44:59,940 --> 00:45:01,280
Gosh, he said I did it on purpose.

1323
00:45:01,280 --> 00:45:03,340
- I think it's Sae Ho.
- Me too.

1324
00:45:03,340 --> 00:45:05,010
- It's him.
- It's not me.

1325
00:45:05,010 --> 00:45:07,050
- But...
- I'm not special enough...

1326
00:45:07,050 --> 00:45:08,340
to be a spy.

1327
00:45:08,650 --> 00:45:10,650
- That's true.
- Right?

1328
00:45:10,650 --> 00:45:12,490
I'm not the star of today's episode.

1329
00:45:12,490 --> 00:45:13,610
- So it's not you.
- I...

1330
00:45:13,610 --> 00:45:15,280
It's not me.

1331
00:45:15,280 --> 00:45:18,150
- That's sad.
- I'm not special enough.

1332
00:45:18,630 --> 00:45:20,630
I think it's Do Hyun.

1333
00:45:20,990 --> 00:45:22,630
- I think it's you.
- It's not me.

1334
00:45:22,630 --> 00:45:24,670
- Really?
- I fulfilled my task...

1335
00:45:24,670 --> 00:45:26,030
during the opening scene.

1336
00:45:27,590 --> 00:45:29,510
Do you want me to take a guess?

1337
00:45:29,740 --> 00:45:31,670
- Sure.
- In Team Actor, it's Do Hyun.

1338
00:45:31,670 --> 00:45:32,880
All right. Next?

1339
00:45:32,880 --> 00:45:34,300
In Team Singer, it's Haha.

1340
00:45:34,300 --> 00:45:35,610
- What?
- And in our team, it's Jae Suk.

1341
00:45:35,710 --> 00:45:37,900
Suspect everyone
except for those three.

1342
00:45:39,070 --> 00:45:40,380
- You look nervous.
- It's Rowoon.

1343
00:45:40,380 --> 00:45:42,050
- It's really not me.
- It's definitely you.

1344
00:45:42,050 --> 00:45:44,050
When I said Do Hyun's name,
Rowoon nodded...

1345
00:45:44,050 --> 00:45:45,460
- as if I was right.
- No.

1346
00:45:45,460 --> 00:45:47,280
- And...
- All I did was agree with you.

1347
00:45:47,280 --> 00:45:50,090
When we suspected him,

1348
00:45:50,090 --> 00:45:51,360
- he smiled.
- Really?

1349
00:45:51,360 --> 00:45:52,960
- I'm always smiling.
- He smiled like this.

1350
00:45:52,960 --> 00:45:55,360
I thought you were looking back,
but you were watching him.

1351
00:45:55,360 --> 00:45:56,920
- I wanted to say that earlier.
- No.

1352
00:45:56,920 --> 00:45:58,170
- Her body was twisted like this.
- You were looking at Rowoon.

1353
00:45:58,170 --> 00:46:00,590
- No, that's not true.
- She knows everything about him.

1354
00:46:00,590 --> 00:46:01,670
She was watching him...

1355
00:46:01,670 --> 00:46:02,840
the entire time.

1356
00:46:02,940 --> 00:46:04,860
- That's not true! Be quiet!
- Jin Young is...

1357
00:46:04,860 --> 00:46:06,800
- It's right.
- Rowoon's spy.

1358
00:46:06,800 --> 00:46:09,300
- She's been watching him only.
- That's not true.

1359
00:46:09,300 --> 00:46:10,740
- No.
- Is Rowoon the spy?

1360
00:46:10,740 --> 00:46:11,780
He is.

1361
00:46:11,780 --> 00:46:13,340
- Really?
- I'm too stupid...

1362
00:46:13,340 --> 00:46:14,550
to deceive others.

1363
00:46:14,550 --> 00:46:16,780
- Really.
- Wait a minute.

1364
00:46:16,780 --> 00:46:19,150
I think Sa Yeon doesn't like me.

1365
00:46:19,150 --> 00:46:20,210
Why not?

1366
00:46:20,210 --> 00:46:22,320
She suspected me of stamping them
with my crutches.

1367
00:46:22,780 --> 00:46:25,230
- Are you sure...
- That's different.

1368
00:46:25,230 --> 00:46:26,900
you didn't stamp them
with your crutches?

1369
00:46:26,900 --> 00:46:28,820
I didn't. I was holding
onto my crutches.

1370
00:46:28,820 --> 00:46:30,070
How is that possible?

1371
00:46:30,300 --> 00:46:32,240
How could I have stamped it
with my crutches?

1372
00:46:32,400 --> 00:46:34,570
- It just doesn't make any sense.
- Let me check your crutches later.

1373
00:46:34,570 --> 00:46:36,110
Be my guest.

1374
00:46:36,110 --> 00:46:37,210
It's really not me.

1375
00:46:37,440 --> 00:46:39,130
- You can do that.
- Let me see your hands.

1376
00:46:39,340 --> 00:46:41,670
Let me see if any of you
have ink on your hands.

1377
00:46:41,670 --> 00:46:42,880
- You're right.
- The ink.

1378
00:46:42,880 --> 00:46:44,280
- Let's see.
- They could have ink on them.

1379
00:46:44,280 --> 00:46:45,740
Sa Yeon, why are your fingers red?

1380
00:46:45,740 --> 00:46:46,740
- What?
- Are they?

1381
00:46:46,740 --> 00:46:48,150
- Sa Yeon.
- It's not me.

1382
00:46:48,150 --> 00:46:49,840
I think she has
good blood circulation.

1383
00:46:49,840 --> 00:46:51,190
Is it because you're healthy?

1384
00:46:51,380 --> 00:46:54,050
Let me see.

1385
00:46:54,050 --> 00:46:55,530
- He's clean.
- Check Sae Ho.

1386
00:46:55,990 --> 00:46:58,800
He should've checked my bag
or something, not inside my ear.

1387
00:46:58,990 --> 00:47:00,800
- Why would he look in there?
- For hygienic purposes.

1388
00:47:00,800 --> 00:47:01,900
Is that so?

1389
00:47:01,900 --> 00:47:02,960
(They fail to find any ink.)

1390
00:47:02,960 --> 00:47:04,570
- When did they do it?
- Could it be a spy...

1391
00:47:04,570 --> 00:47:05,760
from another team?

1392
00:47:05,760 --> 00:47:06,860
- Do Hyun.
- Right.

1393
00:47:06,860 --> 00:47:08,840
- You had trouble focusing today.
- A spy from another team...

1394
00:47:08,840 --> 00:47:10,110
- could stamp instead?
- I did my best today.

1395
00:47:10,110 --> 00:47:12,070
- Really?
- He wasn't that talkative today.

1396
00:47:12,070 --> 00:47:13,440
I did my best...

1397
00:47:13,530 --> 00:47:14,980
- because I didn't win last time.
- No.

1398
00:47:14,980 --> 00:47:17,300
The spies don't want their team
to win.

1399
00:47:17,300 --> 00:47:19,380
You know how your eyes widen
when you lie?

1400
00:47:19,380 --> 00:47:20,480
The spies recognize each other.

1401
00:47:20,480 --> 00:47:22,380
Why can't I stop suspecting him?

1402
00:47:23,090 --> 00:47:24,190
Kwang Soo.

1403
00:47:24,190 --> 00:47:27,150
This is what I think.
Do Hyun is the spy of Team Actor.

1404
00:47:27,650 --> 00:47:30,260
- Why?
- He's acting. No, I'm sure.

1405
00:47:30,260 --> 00:47:32,730
- Why?
- He's been acting all along.

1406
00:47:32,730 --> 00:47:35,730
You were only fixated on Rowoon,
so how would you know that?

1407
00:47:35,900 --> 00:47:38,300
Why would you say it like that?

1408
00:47:38,460 --> 00:47:39,860
Why would you say that?

1409
00:47:39,860 --> 00:47:41,170
You've been staring at Rowoon.

1410
00:47:41,170 --> 00:47:42,360
- It's seriously not me.
- Why would you say that?

1411
00:47:42,360 --> 00:47:44,240
This is the first time I've seen you
ever since the opening scene.

1412
00:47:44,240 --> 00:47:45,510
- Why would you say that?
- You're right.

1413
00:47:45,510 --> 00:47:47,340
- I didn't see you for some time.
- You're right.

1414
00:47:47,340 --> 00:47:49,280
You're the key suspect here.

1415
00:47:49,280 --> 00:47:50,980
Are you caught?

1416
00:47:51,210 --> 00:47:53,050
I think it's Haha.

1417
00:47:53,050 --> 00:47:54,320
It's probably Se Chan.

1418
00:47:54,320 --> 00:47:56,880
- I want to do that as well.
- Don't you think so?

1419
00:47:56,880 --> 00:47:58,760
- Or is it you?
- No, it's really not me.

1420
00:47:58,760 --> 00:48:00,550
- Are you sure? You promise?
- Of course.

1421
00:48:00,550 --> 00:48:02,050
- Do you promise?
- I do.

1422
00:48:02,050 --> 00:48:03,650
It's either Jong Kook or Haha.

1423
00:48:03,960 --> 00:48:05,960
I think it's Haha.

1424
00:48:06,400 --> 00:48:08,050
When we were singing "Poison,"

1425
00:48:08,050 --> 00:48:10,260
- you and I were dancing, right?
- Yes.

1426
00:48:10,260 --> 00:48:13,070
- I looked back.
- This is driving me crazy.

1427
00:48:13,070 --> 00:48:16,070
Jong Kook was behind the sticks.
He was smiling and dancing.

1428
00:48:16,070 --> 00:48:18,210
- Exactly. How would I have...
- That's when I thought...

1429
00:48:18,210 --> 00:48:20,170
- stamped them while dancing?
- He was looking for a chance.

1430
00:48:20,170 --> 00:48:23,400
I had wondered
why he was still back there.

1431
00:48:23,400 --> 00:48:24,440
You're driving me crazy.

1432
00:48:24,840 --> 00:48:27,280
(This was during the first mission.)

1433
00:48:27,940 --> 00:48:29,710
(Jong Kook was dancing alone
in the back.)

1434
00:48:29,710 --> 00:48:32,280
(Did he stamp them
during this moment?)

1435
00:48:32,280 --> 00:48:33,820
- I was going to say this when...
- Hey.

1436
00:48:33,820 --> 00:48:35,190
Was I just standing there?

1437
00:48:35,360 --> 00:48:36,630
- No, you were dancing.
- I was dancing.

1438
00:48:36,630 --> 00:48:38,550
- You were looking for a chance.
- Was I back there for long?

1439
00:48:38,920 --> 00:48:40,960
- I don't know about that.
- It was only for a brief moment,

1440
00:48:40,960 --> 00:48:42,690
- But I saw you back there.
- so how would I have done it?

1441
00:48:42,690 --> 00:48:44,420
- I know you could've done it.
- This is unbelievable.

1442
00:48:44,630 --> 00:48:47,170
When we were doing
our second mission...

1443
00:48:47,170 --> 00:48:49,010
- Jae Suk, Jae Suk.
- Right.

1444
00:48:49,010 --> 00:48:50,860
There were many people in the back.

1445
00:48:51,030 --> 00:48:52,980
Those who were too focused
on the game...

1446
00:48:52,980 --> 00:48:55,380
probably couldn't see
what they were doing in the back.

1447
00:48:55,380 --> 00:48:57,440
- You're right.
- You disappeared several times.

1448
00:48:57,440 --> 00:48:59,670
- Hold on. Jae Suk said...
- Right?

1449
00:49:09,470 --> 00:49:10,490
that Rowoon was tall enough...

1450
00:49:10,490 --> 00:49:11,600
- to watch from the back.
- Right.

1451
00:49:12,060 --> 00:49:13,600
- It's not me.
- Because he's tall.

1452
00:49:15,060 --> 00:49:17,760
(This was
during the second mission.)

1453
00:49:18,640 --> 00:49:21,950
(Rowoon, who was tall,
watched from the back.)

1454
00:49:22,180 --> 00:49:24,040
(Did he stamp them?)

1455
00:49:24,040 --> 00:49:25,370
- It's not me.
- Because he's tall.

1456
00:49:25,580 --> 00:49:26,580
It's really not me.

1457
00:49:26,580 --> 00:49:28,910
- That's when you stamped them.
- It wasn't me.

1458
00:49:29,080 --> 00:49:30,180
- I'm serious.
- But...

1459
00:49:30,180 --> 00:49:31,660
- didn't we...
- Was it you?

1460
00:49:31,660 --> 00:49:32,810
It's really not me.

1461
00:49:32,950 --> 00:49:34,350
I'm terrible at lying.

1462
00:49:34,350 --> 00:49:37,160
- They were together.
- I'm really bad at it.

1463
00:49:37,450 --> 00:49:40,220
<i>- Who are the spies?</i>
- This show feels much harder...

1464
00:49:40,220 --> 00:49:42,560
now that there are spies.

1465
00:49:42,560 --> 00:49:45,790
After hearing about the spies,
I keep suspecting my teammates.

1466
00:49:45,790 --> 00:49:47,540
The final game is called...

1467
00:49:47,600 --> 00:49:50,260
Offense or Defense Hide-And-Seek,
Photos Can Kill.

1468
00:49:50,260 --> 00:49:51,700
What is this?

1469
00:49:52,140 --> 00:49:54,580
Each team will take
both offense and defense positions.

1470
00:49:54,950 --> 00:49:58,180
Every round will be 10 minutes long.
There will be 3 rounds in total.

1471
00:49:58,180 --> 00:49:59,180
This sounds difficult.

1472
00:49:59,180 --> 00:50:00,970
- I bet it is.
- The 1st 2 defense teams...

1473
00:50:01,120 --> 00:50:04,640
will have three minutes to hide
in the annex.

1474
00:50:04,950 --> 00:50:06,910
The offense team will have
bells tied to them...

1475
00:50:06,910 --> 00:50:08,850
and will have 10 minutes
to find them.

1476
00:50:08,850 --> 00:50:10,390
- It's hide-and-seek.
- Correct.

1477
00:50:10,490 --> 00:50:13,620
However, this isn't
Name Tag Elimination.

1478
00:50:13,790 --> 00:50:17,890
You must take a photo
of their name tag or face.

1479
00:50:17,890 --> 00:50:19,290
For their face, the eyes, nose,
and mouth need to be visible.

1480
00:50:19,290 --> 00:50:21,370
For the name tag, two syllables
need to be visible.

1481
00:50:21,370 --> 00:50:22,660
- Can we cover our faces?
- Can we?

1482
00:50:22,660 --> 00:50:23,760
Then you should aim
for their name tag.

1483
00:50:23,760 --> 00:50:25,540
What if they lie down
and cover their face?

1484
00:50:25,540 --> 00:50:27,080
You'll have to lift them up.

1485
00:50:27,280 --> 00:50:30,200
You'll have to step on them
until they put down their hands.

1486
00:50:30,200 --> 00:50:31,310
You can just lift them.

1487
00:50:31,310 --> 00:50:32,620
Are you guys thugs?

1488
00:50:33,850 --> 00:50:35,890
You have the same face and gaze.

1489
00:50:35,890 --> 00:50:37,180
This is just how
we're inclined to be.

1490
00:50:37,180 --> 00:50:39,810
- Really? Okay.
- Yes.

1491
00:50:39,810 --> 00:50:41,120
If the defense teams...

1492
00:50:41,120 --> 00:50:44,060
find the hidden cone hats
and wear them,

1493
00:50:44,060 --> 00:50:46,260
they'll acquire one year's worth
of experience per hat.

1494
00:50:46,260 --> 00:50:47,620
How many hats are there?

1495
00:50:47,620 --> 00:50:49,030
- Come on, now.
- Be quiet.

1496
00:50:49,030 --> 00:50:50,830
- Just be quiet.
- Let the seniors take over.

1497
00:50:50,830 --> 00:50:52,790
What will you do?

1498
00:50:52,790 --> 00:50:54,540
We'll explain it to you
once he's done talking.

1499
00:50:54,540 --> 00:50:56,240
Just pretend to be a doll
while you're here.

1500
00:50:56,410 --> 00:50:57,740
What does he mean?

1501
00:50:57,740 --> 00:51:00,180
Just act like a doll
while you're here.

1502
00:51:00,180 --> 00:51:01,180
- Just stay still.
- Gosh, he's so noisy.

1503
00:51:01,180 --> 00:51:02,780
- He's too ugly to be a doll.
- That's right.

1504
00:51:02,780 --> 00:51:04,240
He needs to regain his weight.

1505
00:51:04,240 --> 00:51:06,080
You don't have the face of a doll.

1506
00:51:06,080 --> 00:51:08,010
- He's so ugly.
- What's wrong with him?

1507
00:51:08,010 --> 00:51:10,580
The more cone hats you wear,
the more years you receive.

1508
00:51:10,580 --> 00:51:12,060
But you could get caught easily.

1509
00:51:12,060 --> 00:51:13,720
- The cone hat gets taller.
- It adds to your height.

1510
00:51:13,720 --> 00:51:15,220
You should make the decision.

1511
00:51:15,220 --> 00:51:17,030
After Round Three,

1512
00:51:17,030 --> 00:51:20,030
the team that eliminated more people
will receive more sticks.

1513
00:51:20,030 --> 00:51:21,030
I see.

1514
00:51:21,330 --> 00:51:23,030
What could be the spies' objective?

1515
00:51:23,030 --> 00:51:25,640
The small tables you saw earlier...

1516
00:51:25,790 --> 00:51:27,540
are hidden
throughout the building.

1517
00:51:28,140 --> 00:51:29,830
If the spies find them first,

1518
00:51:29,830 --> 00:51:31,910
they could put a stamp
on more sticks secretly.

1519
00:51:32,080 --> 00:51:34,810
- We could catch them in the act.
- You are right.

1520
00:51:34,810 --> 00:51:37,010
Lastly, a member
of the offensive team...

1521
00:51:37,010 --> 00:51:39,310
must stay behind
and do a separate mission.

1522
00:51:39,310 --> 00:51:40,580
- What?
- What separate mission?

1523
00:51:40,580 --> 00:51:43,120
The result will decide
if the defensive teams wear bells.

1524
00:51:43,120 --> 00:51:44,410
I will explain later.

1525
00:51:44,450 --> 00:51:46,220
Once we take a photo,
do we send it to someone?

1526
00:51:46,220 --> 00:51:48,010
- Be quiet!
- For goodness' sake!

1527
00:51:48,010 --> 00:51:50,620
You can ask the cameraman
after you take a photo.

1528
00:51:50,620 --> 00:51:52,120
You can ask the cameraman.

1529
00:51:52,120 --> 00:51:54,390
- Keep quiet.
- You should go behind the cameras.

1530
00:51:54,390 --> 00:51:55,600
Sit like a doll and go home.

1531
00:51:55,600 --> 00:51:56,830
Do you want to go
behind the cameras?

1532
00:51:56,830 --> 00:51:58,290
- Is that it?
- You won't take a single photo.

1533
00:51:58,290 --> 00:51:59,660
- Do you want me to get angry?
- Seriously.

1534
00:51:59,660 --> 00:52:01,040
Senior Yang, calm down.

1535
00:52:01,040 --> 00:52:02,240
Okay. I will calm down.

1536
00:52:02,240 --> 00:52:03,760
I don't want to suffer after today.

1537
00:52:04,240 --> 00:52:05,680
We just need to take photos.

1538
00:52:05,680 --> 00:52:07,330
That's right.
We don't need to remove name tags.

1539
00:52:07,330 --> 00:52:08,640
Why do you keep talking?

1540
00:52:08,640 --> 00:52:11,010
I am not an ambitious character.

1541
00:52:11,010 --> 00:52:13,620
- That's right. You aren't.
- I am not ambitious.

1542
00:52:13,620 --> 00:52:14,780
So you aren't impatient.

1543
00:52:14,780 --> 00:52:16,120
Of course not.

1544
00:52:16,120 --> 00:52:17,850
(Impatient)

1545
00:52:18,390 --> 00:52:19,620
Don't look at the cameras.

1546
00:52:19,620 --> 00:52:21,060
- Listen.
- Listen.

1547
00:52:21,060 --> 00:52:23,660
- Listen.
- I am not impatient.

1548
00:52:23,660 --> 00:52:24,950
Seriously.

1549
00:52:24,950 --> 00:52:27,100
Jong Kook.
Ask, "Where is Jin Young?"

1550
00:52:27,220 --> 00:52:28,470
Where is Jin Young?

1551
00:52:28,530 --> 00:52:29,830
Here!

1552
00:52:29,830 --> 00:52:32,290
(Cute)

1553
00:52:32,600 --> 00:52:33,830
I am sorry,

1554
00:52:33,830 --> 00:52:35,930
but stop acting like you are
on "We Got Married."

1555
00:52:35,930 --> 00:52:37,640
- When did I do that?
- That show got canceled.

1556
00:52:37,640 --> 00:52:38,930
Ask again.

1557
00:52:38,970 --> 00:52:40,470
Where is Jin Young?

1558
00:52:40,640 --> 00:52:41,810
Here!

1559
00:52:42,640 --> 00:52:43,810
(She keeps saying, "Here.")

1560
00:52:43,810 --> 00:52:46,510
It's really cute.
Where is Jong Kook?

1561
00:52:46,910 --> 00:52:48,310
- Let's go.
- Come on and say it.

1562
00:52:48,310 --> 00:52:50,120
- It's really cute.
- Stop it already.

1563
00:52:50,120 --> 00:52:52,790
Say, "Here." Where is Jong Kook?

1564
00:52:53,060 --> 00:52:54,310
Here.

1565
00:52:54,310 --> 00:52:56,390
(Here.)

1566
00:52:56,390 --> 00:52:58,430
(She is a Kim Jong Kook tamer.)

1567
00:52:58,890 --> 00:53:01,200
- It's really cute.
- For goodness' sake.

1568
00:53:01,220 --> 00:53:02,390
- It's really cute when men do it.
- Hey.

1569
00:53:02,390 --> 00:53:03,390
Where should we hide?

1570
00:53:03,390 --> 00:53:04,890
Let's go to the first floor
and hide.

1571
00:53:04,890 --> 00:53:06,160
For goodness' sake.

1572
00:53:06,160 --> 00:53:07,160
(While the Here Couple looks
for a place to hide)

1573
00:53:07,740 --> 00:53:09,240
I will find the cone hats first.

1574
00:53:10,640 --> 00:53:12,330
Cone hats. Cone hats.

1575
00:53:14,240 --> 00:53:16,040
Okay. I found one.

1576
00:53:18,280 --> 00:53:19,640
Where are the cone hats?

1577
00:53:20,310 --> 00:53:21,510
Sae Ho.

1578
00:53:22,040 --> 00:53:23,950
- Did you find anything?
- No, I didn't.

1579
00:53:23,950 --> 00:53:26,160
- Cone hats.
- I am looking for cone hats.

1580
00:53:26,160 --> 00:53:27,160
(Everyone focuses on
finding cone hats.)

1581
00:53:27,790 --> 00:53:28,830
- One minute remains.
- Isn't this it?

1582
00:53:29,180 --> 00:53:31,490
- One minute remains.
- Okay.

1583
00:53:31,660 --> 00:53:32,700
Isn't this it?

1584
00:53:32,700 --> 00:53:35,030
(It's a traffic cone,
not a cone hat.)

1585
00:53:36,200 --> 00:53:37,390
Isn't it a cone hat?

1586
00:53:37,430 --> 00:53:38,890
That isn't it.

1587
00:53:38,890 --> 00:53:39,930
Isn't it a cone hat?

1588
00:53:40,100 --> 00:53:41,390
For goodness' sake.

1589
00:53:41,540 --> 00:53:42,740
A cone hat.

1590
00:53:42,760 --> 00:53:43,930
I will go and hide now.

1591
00:53:44,240 --> 00:53:45,540
I need to hide.

1592
00:53:45,540 --> 00:53:47,080
You can't stay here. Go.

1593
00:53:47,080 --> 00:53:48,470
(Everyone starts to hide
when the hiding time nearly ends.)

1594
00:53:51,080 --> 00:53:52,370
(Peek-a-boo)

1595
00:53:53,240 --> 00:53:55,720
(The defensive teams finish hiding.)

1596
00:53:56,510 --> 00:53:59,160
(Jae Suk walks around
without hiding.)

1597
00:53:59,160 --> 00:54:02,660
I need to put a stamp on them.

1598
00:54:02,660 --> 00:54:05,530
(If he needs to put a stamp
on the sticks...)

1599
00:54:05,530 --> 00:54:06,700
Today,

1600
00:54:07,030 --> 00:54:09,600
we will have a race that concludes
the episodes with the prize draw.

1601
00:54:09,600 --> 00:54:14,790
Put a spy's stamp on your sticks
and the members' sticks secretly.

1602
00:54:14,930 --> 00:54:17,140
If the spies collect
the most number of sticks,

1603
00:54:17,140 --> 00:54:18,510
Team Spy will win.

1604
00:54:18,510 --> 00:54:20,080
Gosh, it will be hard.

1605
00:54:20,080 --> 00:54:23,010
(Jae Suk had to secretly put
a spy's stamp on the sticks.)

1606
00:54:23,910 --> 00:54:26,680
(When everyone left after lunch,)

1607
00:54:26,680 --> 00:54:28,680
(he approached a stick table.)

1608
00:54:29,540 --> 00:54:32,680
(He quickly put a stamp
on a few sticks...)

1609
00:54:32,680 --> 00:54:35,620
(and exited as if nothing happened.)

1610
00:54:36,350 --> 00:54:38,120
(While everyone was hiding,)

1611
00:54:38,660 --> 00:54:40,490
(he put a stamp on so many sticks.)

1612
00:54:41,330 --> 00:54:43,260
I should be careful
not to get ink on my hands.

1613
00:54:43,660 --> 00:54:45,640
(Who are the spies
in Team Actor and Team Singer?)

1614
00:54:45,830 --> 00:54:48,660
Now, put a bell on yourself.

1615
00:54:49,060 --> 00:54:50,510
(They put a bell on themselves.)

1616
00:54:50,510 --> 00:54:53,510
Now, you will go and find them.
You have 10 seconds.

1617
00:54:53,540 --> 00:54:55,310
- Good luck.
- Good luck.

1618
00:54:55,310 --> 00:54:56,910
- Do well.
- Okay.

1619
00:54:56,950 --> 00:55:00,370
Five minutes came to an end.
Find the defensive teams.

1620
00:55:01,080 --> 00:55:02,790
(Where are they hiding?)

1621
00:55:02,790 --> 00:55:03,790
I can't see anything.

1622
00:55:04,350 --> 00:55:06,120
(Ringing)

1623
00:55:06,120 --> 00:55:07,490
I think someone is there.

1624
00:55:07,680 --> 00:55:09,760
(Se Chan is hiding
behind the curtain.)

1625
00:55:10,850 --> 00:55:13,060
(The sound of bells startle him.)

1626
00:55:14,220 --> 00:55:16,120
Someone... Someone is here.

1627
00:55:16,120 --> 00:55:17,160
Someone is here.

1628
00:55:17,760 --> 00:55:20,640
(He holds his breath.)

1629
00:55:21,260 --> 00:55:22,810
- Is someone here?
- Yes.

1630
00:55:24,200 --> 00:55:26,970
(To the left of the place
Ji Hyo and Do Hyun are searching,)

1631
00:55:26,970 --> 00:55:29,310
(Se Chan is hiding merely 5m away.)

1632
00:55:29,310 --> 00:55:30,310
Maybe in here.

1633
00:55:30,310 --> 00:55:31,510
(Maybe someone is in here.)

1634
00:55:32,810 --> 00:55:34,140
It's locked.

1635
00:55:34,850 --> 00:55:35,890
Is no one here?

1636
00:55:35,890 --> 00:55:36,890
(They don't look
behind the curtains.)

1637
00:55:37,510 --> 00:55:38,890
Where is Rowoon?

1638
00:55:38,890 --> 00:55:40,850
(Ji Hyo and Do Hyun
leave the studio.)

1639
00:55:43,030 --> 00:55:45,330
(He lets out a sigh of relief.)

1640
00:55:47,220 --> 00:55:48,220
What is this?

1641
00:55:48,720 --> 00:55:49,760
This is...

1642
00:55:52,330 --> 00:55:53,890
(My goodness.)

1643
00:55:53,890 --> 00:55:54,930
Hey.

1644
00:55:55,240 --> 00:55:57,370
So many sticks have a stamp.

1645
00:55:58,830 --> 00:55:59,830
This is insane.

1646
00:55:59,830 --> 00:56:01,310
How did this happen?

1647
00:56:02,850 --> 00:56:04,280
(Rowoon approaches the stick table.)

1648
00:56:04,280 --> 00:56:06,120
A spy must have stamped them.

1649
00:56:07,010 --> 00:56:08,490
(Halting)

1650
00:56:08,490 --> 00:56:10,290
This is no joke.

1651
00:56:10,540 --> 00:56:11,790
What?

1652
00:56:11,790 --> 00:56:13,790
(They don't notice Rowoon at first.)

1653
00:56:13,790 --> 00:56:15,220
(Finally, they spot him.)

1654
00:56:15,220 --> 00:56:16,790
(Suspicious)

1655
00:56:16,790 --> 00:56:18,220
- Is it you?
- Is it you?

1656
00:56:18,220 --> 00:56:20,430
I thought one of you could be a spy.

1657
00:56:20,430 --> 00:56:23,330
(Rowoon runs away hurriedly
when they begin to suspect him.)

1658
00:56:23,700 --> 00:56:24,700
You...

1659
00:56:24,970 --> 00:56:26,200
Hey.

1660
00:56:26,870 --> 00:56:28,740
(Why is he running away?)

1661
00:56:29,810 --> 00:56:32,910
(Is Rowoon the spy in Team Actor?)

1662
00:56:33,740 --> 00:56:34,780
(Peeking)

1663
00:56:34,780 --> 00:56:35,870
- What are you doing?
- You startled me.

1664
00:56:35,870 --> 00:56:37,100
- What are you doing?
- Where did you find this?

1665
00:56:37,100 --> 00:56:38,140
(He gets scared easily.)

1666
00:56:38,140 --> 00:56:40,040
- What are you doing?
- Where did you find this?

1667
00:56:40,040 --> 00:56:41,680
- It was easy to find.
- Really?

1668
00:56:42,240 --> 00:56:43,890
- Hey.
- I am nervous.

1669
00:56:43,890 --> 00:56:45,580
(Ringing)

1670
00:56:46,450 --> 00:56:48,530
(They escape to the elevator.)

1671
00:56:49,580 --> 00:56:52,720
(Do Hyun follows the voices.)

1672
00:56:54,120 --> 00:56:56,160
(He suddenly turns
toward the elevator.)

1673
00:56:57,160 --> 00:56:59,140
(The door isn't closed yet.)

1674
00:56:59,870 --> 00:57:01,740
(It slowly begins to close,)

1675
00:57:01,740 --> 00:57:04,600
(but Do Hyun is
just around the corner.)

1676
00:57:05,470 --> 00:57:08,040
(Please close faster.)

1677
00:57:08,540 --> 00:57:10,100
(The doors are finally closed!)

1678
00:57:10,950 --> 00:57:13,280
(Do Hyun misses them in a pinch.)

1679
00:57:13,970 --> 00:57:15,910
(I definitely heard voices.)

1680
00:57:16,990 --> 00:57:18,790
(They breathe again.)

1681
00:57:19,620 --> 00:57:21,760
(They almost got caught.)

1682
00:57:22,120 --> 00:57:23,120
Where did you find it?

1683
00:57:23,120 --> 00:57:25,290
- It was easy to find.
- Let me try it on once.

1684
00:57:25,290 --> 00:57:26,830
My hair got matted.

1685
00:57:26,890 --> 00:57:27,890
What are you talking about?

1686
00:57:28,530 --> 00:57:30,370
How did you win an award
in the music and talk show division?

1687
00:57:30,600 --> 00:57:31,720
Let's get off.

1688
00:57:32,040 --> 00:57:33,040
Come on.

1689
00:57:33,140 --> 00:57:34,390
Let's get off.

1690
00:57:34,390 --> 00:57:35,600
- I will go this way.
- Okay.

1691
00:57:35,600 --> 00:57:37,140
(They part ways again.)

1692
00:57:38,580 --> 00:57:40,910
(He finds a cone hat
right in front of him.)

1693
00:57:41,040 --> 00:57:42,850
Sae Ho, it's here. You are a fool.

1694
00:57:42,850 --> 00:57:44,810
What? How did you find that?

1695
00:57:44,870 --> 00:57:46,180
Where was it?

1696
00:57:46,510 --> 00:57:47,620
Se Chan.

1697
00:57:47,740 --> 00:57:49,720
Sae Ho, I found a cone over here.

1698
00:57:49,720 --> 00:57:51,890
Give me one. Is there one?

1699
00:57:51,890 --> 00:57:52,890
(Se Chan is nice.)

1700
00:57:53,910 --> 00:57:54,910
Hurry up.

1701
00:57:54,910 --> 00:57:55,930
You...

1702
00:57:55,930 --> 00:57:58,530
(Sae Ho, here is
a cone-shaped snack.)

1703
00:57:59,030 --> 00:58:00,660
- A cone-shaped snack.
- Forget it.

1704
00:58:00,660 --> 00:58:01,760
Are you talking about ice cream?

1705
00:58:01,760 --> 00:58:03,430
Here is a cone-shaped snack.

1706
00:58:03,430 --> 00:58:04,490
Hurry up and put it on.

1707
00:58:04,490 --> 00:58:05,700
(Put them on your fingers.)

1708
00:58:05,700 --> 00:58:07,390
He made fun of me.

1709
00:58:07,390 --> 00:58:08,390
(I have no time.)

1710
00:58:09,260 --> 00:58:11,140
(Meanwhile,
Jae Suk the spy is hiding.)

1711
00:58:12,240 --> 00:58:13,240
(He meets Haha,
the cone hat collector.)

1712
00:58:13,240 --> 00:58:15,450
Why do you have so many cone hats?

1713
00:58:16,310 --> 00:58:17,700
Are you making a tower?

1714
00:58:17,700 --> 00:58:19,310
It's like Dabo Pagoda.

1715
00:58:19,310 --> 00:58:20,720
Why aren't you doing anything?

1716
00:58:20,910 --> 00:58:22,220
What? What do you mean?

1717
00:58:22,220 --> 00:58:23,680
(He got caught.)

1718
00:58:23,740 --> 00:58:25,010
I am hiding.

1719
00:58:25,010 --> 00:58:26,510
Why aren't you doing anything else?

1720
00:58:26,510 --> 00:58:28,220
- What else should I do?
- Look for the cone hats.

1721
00:58:28,220 --> 00:58:29,580
I have seniority.

1722
00:58:30,430 --> 00:58:32,060
Why should I find the cone hats
when I have seniority?

1723
00:58:32,990 --> 00:58:34,890
(Something seems off
about Jae Suk.)

1724
00:58:34,890 --> 00:58:36,120
You are acting strange.

1725
00:58:37,060 --> 00:58:40,640
A mission for the representative
of the offensive team starts now.

1726
00:58:40,640 --> 00:58:43,700
Stick in 10 swords
into the barrel with 16 slots.

1727
00:58:43,700 --> 00:58:46,430
If the pirate pops up,
you must give one of your sticks...

1728
00:58:46,430 --> 00:58:48,510
to a member of a defensive team.

1729
00:58:48,580 --> 00:58:50,310
If the pirate doesn't pop up,

1730
00:58:50,310 --> 00:58:53,720
you can put a bell
on a member of a defensive team.

1731
00:58:53,720 --> 00:58:56,010
Let's start right away.

1732
00:58:56,680 --> 00:58:58,810
(Popping up)

1733
00:58:59,890 --> 00:59:01,510
(For goodness' sake.)

1734
00:59:01,620 --> 00:59:05,330
To which member
will you give a stick?

1735
00:59:06,430 --> 00:59:09,160
I will give a stick
to Haha of Team Singer.

1736
00:59:09,160 --> 00:59:11,390
It will go to Haha.

1737
00:59:12,260 --> 00:59:14,240
You heard the bells earlier, right?

1738
00:59:15,140 --> 00:59:16,260
You can't see me, right?

1739
00:59:16,700 --> 00:59:17,830
All right.

1740
00:59:18,260 --> 00:59:21,330
(Someone approaches
Team Actor's stick table.)

1741
00:59:22,350 --> 00:59:24,740
(This person begins to stamp
the spy's stamp.)

1742
00:59:26,120 --> 00:59:28,810
(Then the spy quickly leaves.)

1743
00:59:29,390 --> 00:59:30,990
No one is in the restroom, right?

1744
00:59:31,310 --> 00:59:32,660
- Gosh, you startled me.
- Ji Hyo.

1745
00:59:32,890 --> 00:59:34,010
- You startled me.
- You can't find anyone, right?

1746
00:59:34,010 --> 00:59:35,890
I can't find anyone.
This place is too big.

1747
00:59:37,220 --> 00:59:38,620
There must be someone in here.

1748
00:59:38,620 --> 00:59:40,120
(Rowoon heads somewhere
after a short conversation.)

1749
00:59:40,430 --> 00:59:42,200
- Rowoon. Rowoon. Rowoon.
- Yes?

1750
00:59:42,490 --> 00:59:45,540
Let's look once more.
I think someone is hiding in here.

1751
00:59:45,540 --> 00:59:48,060
Someone must be hiding in here.
It's the perfect place.

1752
00:59:48,060 --> 00:59:49,140
(She gets a hunch.)

1753
00:59:49,910 --> 00:59:51,430
(Jong Kook and Jin Young
are hiding nearby.)

1754
00:59:51,430 --> 00:59:53,410
- Seriously.
- Quiet.

1755
00:59:53,410 --> 00:59:54,580
Our bells are so loud.

1756
00:59:54,580 --> 00:59:57,580
(The sound of the bells approaches.)

1757
00:59:59,850 --> 01:00:00,850
(What?)

1758
01:00:00,850 --> 01:00:02,290
- Someone is there.
- Who is it?

1759
01:00:02,290 --> 01:00:03,310
(Who is it?)

1760
01:00:05,620 --> 01:00:08,720
(They shield
their eyes, nose, and mouth.)

1761
01:00:09,620 --> 01:00:11,220
(Unfortunately, the member
they found is Jong Kook.)

1762
01:00:11,220 --> 01:00:12,220
Who is it?

1763
01:00:12,220 --> 01:00:13,390
Cover your nose and mouth.

1764
01:00:15,160 --> 01:00:16,290
- I am sorry.
- Don't worry.

1765
01:00:16,290 --> 01:00:17,930
- I can't help it.
- It's okay.

1766
01:00:18,790 --> 01:00:20,970
(Ji Hyo moves in with a camera.)

1767
01:00:21,830 --> 01:00:25,700
(Jong Kook fights Ji Hyo off
with his nose and mouth covered.)

1768
01:00:26,430 --> 01:00:27,910
This is driving me crazy.

1769
01:00:27,910 --> 01:00:30,310
- Come on. Hold on.
- Where should I go?

1770
01:00:30,310 --> 01:00:32,180
- Keep covered.
- For goodness' sake.

1771
01:00:32,180 --> 01:00:34,010
(Rowoon attempts to get a photo.)

1772
01:00:34,740 --> 01:00:37,510
(Those who want a photo
versus Those who don't want a photo)

1773
01:00:37,510 --> 01:00:38,910
Come on.

1774
01:00:38,910 --> 01:00:40,660
- Who are they?
- Stop it.

1775
01:00:40,950 --> 01:00:42,120
Come on.

1776
01:00:42,330 --> 01:00:43,430
Look here.

1777
01:00:43,430 --> 01:00:45,390
- Look here.
- My face.

1778
01:00:45,660 --> 01:00:46,790
I will take a photo.

1779
01:00:46,790 --> 01:00:47,930
Hurry up and take a photo.

1780
01:00:47,930 --> 01:00:49,220
- Hurry up and take a photo.
- Hold on.

1781
01:00:49,220 --> 01:00:50,330
Hide.

1782
01:00:50,430 --> 01:00:52,060
I can't do it.

1783
01:00:52,060 --> 01:00:54,870
- Come on.
- We picked tough opponents.

1784
01:00:54,870 --> 01:00:56,430
- Take the picture.
- I got a photo of Jin Young.

1785
01:00:56,660 --> 01:00:57,870
- No.
- Did you get it?

1786
01:00:57,870 --> 01:01:00,410
- I got it.
- You should have stayed hidden.

1787
01:01:00,640 --> 01:01:03,310
(He got a photo that shows
her eyes, nose, and mouth.)

1788
01:01:03,580 --> 01:01:04,780
Jin Young is out.

1789
01:01:04,780 --> 01:01:06,120
- Who?
- Jin Young is out.

1790
01:01:06,120 --> 01:01:08,310
- Did he get a photo of her face?
- Yes, he did.

1791
01:01:08,310 --> 01:01:10,350
- Really?
- Yes. Who took it?

1792
01:01:10,350 --> 01:01:11,510
Look behind you!

1793
01:01:11,510 --> 01:01:13,450
(At that moment,)

1794
01:01:14,760 --> 01:01:17,930
(Do Hyun tries to get a photo
from outside the window.)

1795
01:01:17,990 --> 01:01:19,100
The window is reflective.

1796
01:01:20,530 --> 01:01:23,060
(Jong Kook stands his ground,)

1797
01:01:23,700 --> 01:01:26,040
(but Ji Hyo is tough.)

1798
01:01:26,260 --> 01:01:27,330
Come on.

1799
01:01:27,330 --> 01:01:29,140
(While Rowoon aims for his face,)

1800
01:01:29,140 --> 01:01:30,260
(Ji Hyo aims for his name tag.)

1801
01:01:30,260 --> 01:01:31,660
Come on!

1802
01:01:32,200 --> 01:01:34,240
We did it.

1803
01:01:35,180 --> 01:01:36,850
I got a photo of it! Kim Jong Kook!

1804
01:01:37,100 --> 01:01:39,470
(She succeeded to get
two characters in the photo.)

1805
01:01:39,470 --> 01:01:42,350
Rowoon, we caught the big fish.
We caught the big fish.

1806
01:01:42,640 --> 01:01:44,680
(Jong Kook is out.)

1807
01:01:44,680 --> 01:01:46,810
I had no clue
they were hiding over there.

1808
01:01:47,560 --> 01:01:49,160
The first race is over.

1809
01:01:49,950 --> 01:01:51,430
Five members of Team Comedian...

1810
01:01:51,560 --> 01:01:54,060
and two members of Team Actor
got eliminated.

1811
01:01:54,120 --> 01:01:57,160
Now, Team Singer will be
the offensive team.

1812
01:01:57,160 --> 01:01:58,220
They are dead.

1813
01:01:58,220 --> 01:02:01,640
- The other two teams will hide.
- Let's hide.

1814
01:02:01,870 --> 01:02:04,260
- Kwang Soo, we will be back.
- We will be back.

1815
01:02:04,260 --> 01:02:06,200
- We will get going.
- Sae Ho, you are in Team Comedian.

1816
01:02:06,680 --> 01:02:08,470
Why is a junior taking so long?

1817
01:02:08,910 --> 01:02:10,280
Senior Yang.

1818
01:02:10,410 --> 01:02:12,350
- Senior Yang.
- Do you want a beating?

1819
01:02:12,350 --> 01:02:13,680
(You punk.)

1820
01:02:13,680 --> 01:02:15,010
Don't raise your fist.

1821
01:02:15,740 --> 01:02:17,220
Sae Ho, we need to talk.

1822
01:02:17,220 --> 01:02:18,890
- Senior Yang.
- Listen.

1823
01:02:19,010 --> 01:02:20,950
- When the seniors leave...
- Are you a nagger?

1824
01:02:20,950 --> 01:02:22,260
I am not a nagger.

1825
01:02:22,260 --> 01:02:23,620
Why did you move so slowly?

1826
01:02:23,830 --> 01:02:25,450
I have a kind heart.

1827
01:02:25,450 --> 01:02:27,830
If you take advantage of that,
I will become a gangster.

1828
01:02:28,160 --> 01:02:30,930
- Why would you do that?
- You are such a nagger.

1829
01:02:31,430 --> 01:02:33,540
- I am the real nagger.
- I know that.

1830
01:02:33,890 --> 01:02:35,100
I know that.

1831
01:02:35,100 --> 01:02:37,200
- You are the worst nagger.
- I don't want to lose that title.

1832
01:02:37,510 --> 01:02:38,870
Here comes
the absolute worst nagger.

1833
01:02:39,780 --> 01:02:41,680
Who is talking so loudly
on the street?

1834
01:02:41,680 --> 01:02:42,850
I am sorry.

1835
01:02:42,970 --> 01:02:44,780
- It was you.
- It was me.

1836
01:02:44,780 --> 01:02:45,910
All right.

1837
01:02:45,970 --> 01:02:47,720
I will start from the bottom.

1838
01:02:48,080 --> 01:02:49,220
Suk Jin.

1839
01:02:49,220 --> 01:02:51,390
Suk Jin, would you stay
with Jae Suk?

1840
01:02:51,450 --> 01:02:52,660
- Why?
- He is suspicious.

1841
01:02:52,680 --> 01:02:53,760
- He is acting strangely, right?
- Yes.

1842
01:02:53,790 --> 01:02:56,580
- I am suspicious of Jae Suk too.
- From now on...

1843
01:02:56,580 --> 01:02:58,160
- Stay with Jae Suk.
- Stay with him.

1844
01:02:58,160 --> 01:03:00,100
- I will trail him.
- Okay.

1845
01:03:00,530 --> 01:03:02,390
- Shall we work together?
- Yes.

1846
01:03:02,470 --> 01:03:03,490
Sae Ho.

1847
01:03:03,970 --> 01:03:06,200
- Where did you hide earlier?
- Over there.

1848
01:03:06,200 --> 01:03:07,390
There is a good spot.
Do you want to see it?

1849
01:03:07,470 --> 01:03:08,870
- On the first floor?
- Yes.

1850
01:03:09,060 --> 01:03:11,010
- The place with the black cloth.
- You're not a spy, are you?

1851
01:03:11,040 --> 01:03:12,510
I am not a spy.

1852
01:03:12,510 --> 01:03:14,830
- We think Rowoon is the spy.
- Really?

1853
01:03:14,830 --> 01:03:17,240
- We are suspicious of Jae Suk.
- Jae Suk?

1854
01:03:17,240 --> 01:03:19,010
- Yes.
- Seriously.

1855
01:03:19,280 --> 01:03:23,580
Rowoon and Jae Suk are
in the same agency too.

1856
01:03:23,580 --> 01:03:24,990
(What?)

1857
01:03:24,990 --> 01:03:26,160
- Really?
- They are in the same agency.

1858
01:03:26,160 --> 01:03:28,290
That has nothing to do
with the race.

1859
01:03:28,310 --> 01:03:30,180
Running Man wouldn't do that.

1860
01:03:30,180 --> 01:03:31,450
I know that,
but they are in the same agency.

1861
01:03:31,450 --> 01:03:33,260
- You and I are in the same agency.
- You are right.

1862
01:03:34,120 --> 01:03:35,760
- We are in the same agency.
- I also think...

1863
01:03:35,990 --> 01:03:38,060
Rowoon is suspicious.

1864
01:03:38,470 --> 01:03:40,490
He said,
"I think I know who the spy is."

1865
01:03:40,490 --> 01:03:41,600
Seriously.

1866
01:03:41,830 --> 01:03:43,160
- Let's hurry up and hide.
- Okay.

1867
01:03:43,160 --> 01:03:44,370
- See you later.
- See you later.

1868
01:03:45,700 --> 01:03:46,810
All right.

1869
01:03:46,930 --> 01:03:49,910
(Se Chan halts on his way to hide.)

1870
01:03:49,910 --> 01:03:51,010
This time,

1871
01:03:51,010 --> 01:03:53,120
can I hide here and see
if anyone does something?

1872
01:03:54,010 --> 01:03:55,120
I will hide here.

1873
01:03:55,280 --> 01:03:56,490
Should the cameras stay here?

1874
01:03:56,640 --> 01:03:59,010
That's right. Stay away.
I will be over here.

1875
01:04:01,850 --> 01:04:03,890
I will be over here.

1876
01:04:03,890 --> 01:04:06,030
(Will Detective Yang's effort
pay off?)

1877
01:04:07,350 --> 01:04:08,700
You will go and find them
after two minutes.

1878
01:04:09,560 --> 01:04:12,390
Jong Kook can do something cute.
Do you want to see it?

1879
01:04:12,700 --> 01:04:13,740
Stop it.

1880
01:04:13,740 --> 01:04:15,760
- Where is Jong Kook?
- We got it on the camera.

1881
01:04:15,760 --> 01:04:17,010
Hurry up.

1882
01:04:17,010 --> 01:04:18,740
We got it on the camera.
They don't need to see it.

1883
01:04:18,740 --> 01:04:20,810
- Show them. It's cute.
- No, no.

1884
01:04:20,910 --> 01:04:23,140
- Hurry up and do it.
- For goodness' sake.

1885
01:04:23,140 --> 01:04:24,850
Why won't you do it now?

1886
01:04:24,950 --> 01:04:27,040
Please tell me in advance
if she is visiting the show.

1887
01:04:28,040 --> 01:04:29,850
I'm going to say it.
Where is Jong Kook?

1888
01:04:29,850 --> 01:04:30,850
Here.

1889
01:04:30,850 --> 01:04:32,220
(Here.)

1890
01:04:33,350 --> 01:04:35,260
(Here.)

1891
01:04:35,830 --> 01:04:36,890
What was that?

1892
01:04:36,890 --> 01:04:37,990
(They can't believe
what they heard.)

1893
01:04:37,990 --> 01:04:39,760
- What was that?
- Seriously.

1894
01:04:39,760 --> 01:04:42,390
- What was that?
- What was that, Jong Kook?

1895
01:04:42,390 --> 01:04:44,290
- What did you do just now?
- I don't even know.

1896
01:04:44,890 --> 01:04:46,390
She roped me into this.

1897
01:04:46,390 --> 01:04:48,870
- Where is Jong Kook?
- Here.

1898
01:04:48,870 --> 01:04:50,140
(They give an encore performance.)

1899
01:04:50,140 --> 01:04:51,240
(I don't want to hear it.)

1900
01:04:51,240 --> 01:04:52,410
Jong Kook.

1901
01:04:52,930 --> 01:04:54,180
I am cringing.

1902
01:04:54,200 --> 01:04:56,010
That was ridiculous. My goodness.

1903
01:04:57,040 --> 01:04:59,240
(Be quiet!)

1904
01:04:59,510 --> 01:05:01,780
"Here"? You make me laugh!

1905
01:05:02,490 --> 01:05:04,080
What's wrong with him?

1906
01:05:04,080 --> 01:05:05,310
(What's wrong with him?)

1907
01:05:05,310 --> 01:05:08,060
It's something Jin Young does.

1908
01:05:08,060 --> 01:05:09,790
You will leave in 10 seconds.

1909
01:05:09,890 --> 01:05:11,430
Don't edit this out.

1910
01:05:11,790 --> 01:05:13,430
Okay? Make sure you air this.

1911
01:05:13,430 --> 01:05:14,700
- Let's go.
- Good luck.

1912
01:05:14,700 --> 01:05:16,220
- Don't edit this out.
- Okay. Let's go.

1913
01:05:16,430 --> 01:05:18,530
- Don't make them edit it out.
- Let's go.

1914
01:05:19,140 --> 01:05:20,740
- We will be back.
- Bye.

1915
01:05:20,740 --> 01:05:22,060
- Do a good job.
- You have an important role.

1916
01:05:22,060 --> 01:05:23,240
(How many members
will Team Singer eliminate?)

1917
01:05:23,240 --> 01:05:25,310
- There is a spy in here.
- Where?

1918
01:05:25,640 --> 01:05:26,930
- Here.
- Among the three of us?

1919
01:05:28,680 --> 01:05:31,680
(Haha is acting strangely.)

1920
01:05:31,680 --> 01:05:34,010
Why are you laughing?
For goodness' sake.

1921
01:05:34,010 --> 01:05:35,720
Haha, you keep going around
on your own.

1922
01:05:36,080 --> 01:05:37,790
Jin Young,

1923
01:05:37,790 --> 01:05:39,080
get a hold of yourself.

1924
01:05:39,910 --> 01:05:41,310
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

1925
01:05:41,790 --> 01:05:42,890
Let's go.

1926
01:05:43,350 --> 01:05:44,490
Let's get them.

1927
01:05:45,260 --> 01:05:47,450
Where are they hiding?

1928
01:05:48,890 --> 01:05:51,030
It would be the best
to stay in here.

1929
01:05:53,240 --> 01:05:55,260
(Ringing)

1930
01:05:55,260 --> 01:05:56,970
(Startled)

1931
01:05:58,060 --> 01:06:00,200
(I hear a noise over there.)

1932
01:06:01,080 --> 01:06:02,740
(He enters a room.)

1933
01:06:02,740 --> 01:06:04,310
(Shouting)

1934
01:06:05,180 --> 01:06:06,350
(Excuse me.)

1935
01:06:06,740 --> 01:06:07,910
I am not here.

1936
01:06:08,410 --> 01:06:10,310
I am not here.
Please stand over there.

1937
01:06:10,540 --> 01:06:12,890
(While Suk Jin was looking
for a place to hide,)

1938
01:06:12,890 --> 01:06:15,350
(Jong Kook heard a shout.)

1939
01:06:16,260 --> 01:06:17,290
Hello.

1940
01:06:17,290 --> 01:06:19,390
(He follows the shout to the door.)

1941
01:06:19,700 --> 01:06:21,160
Didn't you hear something?

1942
01:06:23,530 --> 01:06:25,970
(Scary knocking)

1943
01:06:26,760 --> 01:06:29,760
<i>Do you want to build a snowman?</i>

1944
01:06:30,870 --> 01:06:31,970
Jin Young, we don't have time.

1945
01:06:31,970 --> 01:06:33,600
(Jin Young and Jong Kook
have manners.)

1946
01:06:33,600 --> 01:06:34,780
Hurry up and find him.

1947
01:06:34,830 --> 01:06:35,870
Oh, there he is.

1948
01:06:36,310 --> 01:06:38,850
(Did he spot Suk Jin?)

1949
01:06:39,010 --> 01:06:40,240
(A photo with eyes, nose, and mouth
or two characters of the name tag)

1950
01:06:40,240 --> 01:06:42,010
Jin Young, move.

1951
01:06:42,280 --> 01:06:44,390
- Jong Kook.
- Okay. Get ready.

1952
01:06:44,390 --> 01:06:46,180
(Will they be able to eliminate
Suk Jin?)

1953
01:06:46,180 --> 01:06:47,260
Pull him up.

1954
01:06:47,890 --> 01:06:48,950
All right.

1955
01:06:49,330 --> 01:06:50,330
Three.

1956
01:06:50,680 --> 01:06:54,100
(He pulls Suk Jin up easily.)

1957
01:06:55,030 --> 01:06:57,290
(All three characters of his name
are visible.)

1958
01:06:57,470 --> 01:06:58,530
All done.

1959
01:06:59,260 --> 01:07:00,760
How did you see me? Was I visible?

1960
01:07:01,200 --> 01:07:02,240
You were visible.

1961
01:07:02,510 --> 01:07:05,010
(Suk Jin gets eliminated
right away!)

1962
01:07:05,010 --> 01:07:08,330
<i>I need to find a cone hat</i>

1963
01:07:09,870 --> 01:07:11,600
(At that moment,)

1964
01:07:11,600 --> 01:07:13,910
(he spots the offensive team!)

1965
01:07:14,810 --> 01:07:16,890
(He runs away right away.)

1966
01:07:16,890 --> 01:07:19,760
(Haha runs after him!)

1967
01:07:20,790 --> 01:07:23,350
(My legs, save me.)

1968
01:07:26,600 --> 01:07:29,290
(Relaxed)

1969
01:07:30,790 --> 01:07:31,970
Just get a photo taken.

1970
01:07:32,370 --> 01:07:33,790
- Turn around.
- No.

1971
01:07:33,890 --> 01:07:35,370
- Hurry up and turn around.
- No.

1972
01:07:35,390 --> 01:07:36,470
Let me go this once.

1973
01:07:36,470 --> 01:07:38,540
- I will give you a prize!
- Okay, okay.

1974
01:07:38,540 --> 01:07:39,740
I will give you a prize.

1975
01:07:40,280 --> 01:07:41,410
I am serious.

1976
01:07:41,740 --> 01:07:43,200
I will give it to you
instead of my mom.

1977
01:07:43,240 --> 01:07:44,680
I am serious. Haha.

1978
01:07:44,680 --> 01:07:46,010
- I will give it to your mom.
- No, no.

1979
01:07:46,040 --> 01:07:47,470
But... Really?

1980
01:07:47,470 --> 01:07:48,870
- I will give it to your mom.
- No, no.

1981
01:07:48,870 --> 01:07:51,140
- But... Really?
- Yes. I will give it to your mom.

1982
01:07:51,450 --> 01:07:52,560
Let me get a photo.

1983
01:07:52,760 --> 01:07:53,890
- Really?
- It's okay.

1984
01:07:53,890 --> 01:07:55,080
Let's get a pretty photo.

1985
01:07:55,350 --> 01:07:57,490
One... If I get a prize,
I will give it to your mom.

1986
01:07:57,560 --> 01:07:59,450
- Look pretty. 1, 2, 3.
- Really?

1987
01:07:59,700 --> 01:08:02,030
(He gives a big smile.)

1988
01:08:02,030 --> 01:08:04,700
(Please give me the prize.)

1989
01:08:05,890 --> 01:08:07,040
- Really?
- Ma'am.

1990
01:08:07,040 --> 01:08:09,060
Ma'am, I will give you the prize...

1991
01:08:09,100 --> 01:08:10,560
- Mom, Haha made a promise.
- if I get it.

1992
01:08:10,740 --> 01:08:12,100
Ma'am, I love you. Stay healthy.

1993
01:08:12,100 --> 01:08:13,410
- I love you, Mom.
- Okay.

1994
01:08:13,410 --> 01:08:14,680
- Haha.
- Don't worry.

1995
01:08:15,140 --> 01:08:16,410
If I get the prize...

1996
01:08:16,700 --> 01:08:19,540
(Meanwhile, Sae Ho)

1997
01:08:21,310 --> 01:08:23,580
(He is doing something
with a yellow sign.)

1998
01:08:26,680 --> 01:08:28,910
(You can't see me, right?)

1999
01:08:30,060 --> 01:08:32,920
(His hiding place
grabs attention from afar.)

2000
01:08:34,000 --> 01:08:36,670
(The sound of bells approaches.)

2001
01:08:37,530 --> 01:08:40,130
(Sae Ho is here.)

2002
01:08:40,890 --> 01:08:42,600
(I got caught.)

2003
01:08:43,430 --> 01:08:45,340
(He got caught.)

2004
01:08:47,100 --> 01:08:49,000
- Jin Young, get ready.
- Okay.

2005
01:08:49,000 --> 01:08:50,170
(Jong Kook and Jin Young
get ready to work.)

2006
01:08:51,580 --> 01:08:52,750
1, 2, 3.

2007
01:08:53,810 --> 01:08:54,920
1, 2, 3.

2008
01:08:55,380 --> 01:08:57,120
(A piece of cake)

2009
01:08:57,250 --> 01:08:59,350
(Humiliated)

2010
01:09:00,050 --> 01:09:03,660
(Sae Ho's hide-and-seek ends
in a humiliating fashion.)

2011
01:09:04,330 --> 01:09:05,590
He is so cute.

2012
01:09:05,590 --> 01:09:07,250
(I didn't expect this.)

2013
01:09:07,660 --> 01:09:09,300
I couldn't even find a cone hat.

2014
01:09:09,300 --> 01:09:10,500
(Sae Ho heads to the jail.)

2015
01:09:10,500 --> 01:09:11,700
I go down this way.

2016
01:09:11,700 --> 01:09:14,260
(He stumbles upon a stick table.)

2017
01:09:14,840 --> 01:09:16,710
(How many sticks
does everyone have?)

2018
01:09:17,870 --> 01:09:19,780
- What are you doing?
- Gosh, you startled me.

2019
01:09:20,580 --> 01:09:21,930
(Detective Yang attacks.)

2020
01:09:21,930 --> 01:09:22,950
I got you.

2021
01:09:22,950 --> 01:09:24,080
You tried to stamp them, right?

2022
01:09:24,080 --> 01:09:25,840
- What are you talking about?
- No.

2023
01:09:26,140 --> 01:09:27,620
- I saw it.
- For goodness' sake.

2024
01:09:27,620 --> 01:09:28,840
You tried to stamp them, right?

2025
01:09:28,840 --> 01:09:31,420
- What are you talking about?
- I saw it.

2026
01:09:31,590 --> 01:09:32,750
- For goodness' sake.
- Hold on.

2027
01:09:33,850 --> 01:09:35,680
Gosh, there is a lot.

2028
01:09:36,660 --> 01:09:37,850
So you were the spy.

2029
01:09:37,850 --> 01:09:40,200
You are a fool. You are a fool.

2030
01:09:40,220 --> 01:09:42,220
I waited all this time
to catch someone in the act.

2031
01:09:42,330 --> 01:09:44,390
You sneaked up.

2032
01:09:44,390 --> 01:09:45,960
- You tried to stamp the sticks.
- I will tell the truth.

2033
01:09:45,960 --> 01:09:47,840
- Sae Ho.
- I got eliminated already.

2034
01:09:48,040 --> 01:09:49,540
I get that, but why did you...

2035
01:09:49,540 --> 01:09:51,630
No. Since I got eliminated,
I can't do anything.

2036
01:09:51,630 --> 01:09:53,910
- I was just passing by.
- I know what I saw.

2037
01:09:53,910 --> 01:09:55,340
I am serious when I say this.
I am not a spy.

2038
01:09:55,800 --> 01:09:57,800
I am serious. I am not a spy.

2039
01:09:58,170 --> 01:09:59,920
I am sorry. I will get going now.

2040
01:10:00,170 --> 01:10:01,450
For goodness' sake.

2041
01:10:01,470 --> 01:10:03,840
Is he stupid or what?

2042
01:10:04,680 --> 01:10:06,620
My hunch was right.

2043
01:10:07,550 --> 01:10:09,180
My 23 years of experience paid off.

2044
01:10:09,460 --> 01:10:10,590
I knew he would come.

2045
01:10:11,380 --> 01:10:12,590
He actually came.

2046
01:10:13,220 --> 01:10:15,420
(Meanwhile, Jae Suk,
the real spy...)

2047
01:10:17,560 --> 01:10:18,700
I will stamp all of them.

2048
01:10:18,700 --> 01:10:19,700
(He is running a factory.)

2049
01:10:21,130 --> 01:10:23,410
(Thus, Round 3 ends.)

2050
01:10:23,410 --> 01:10:25,210
(Team Singer eliminates 3 people.)

2051
01:10:25,460 --> 01:10:27,600
I will give you sticks
per the result of Round Three.

2052
01:10:27,600 --> 01:10:28,670
Do we get nine?

2053
01:10:29,130 --> 01:10:32,080
Haha and Sa Yeon, I caught a spy.

2054
01:10:32,780 --> 01:10:34,050
Are you certain?

2055
01:10:34,050 --> 01:10:35,250
I saw it with my own eyes.

2056
01:10:36,380 --> 01:10:37,680
Sae Ho is a spy.

2057
01:10:37,680 --> 01:10:39,180
- Sae Ho?
- My goodness.

2058
01:10:39,210 --> 01:10:41,680
One of them must be the spy.
What happened?

2059
01:10:41,680 --> 01:10:43,850
Gather around. I caught a spy.

2060
01:10:44,050 --> 01:10:45,250
For goodness' sake.

2061
01:10:45,250 --> 01:10:46,700
You are an utter fool.

2062
01:10:46,850 --> 01:10:49,800
It's no wonder he looked worried.

2063
01:10:50,390 --> 01:10:52,300
- Hey.
- You need to trust me.

2064
01:10:52,300 --> 01:10:53,760
You are a spy.

2065
01:10:53,760 --> 01:10:55,960
I got you. You are a spy.

2066
01:10:55,960 --> 01:10:58,100
- It's him! It's him!
- For goodness' sake.

2067
01:10:58,300 --> 01:10:59,970
- It's him! It's him!
- You kept acting suspiciously.

2068
01:10:59,970 --> 01:11:01,670
- The final results are out.
- Okay.

2069
01:11:02,040 --> 01:11:03,880
Like I told you before,

2070
01:11:03,970 --> 01:11:05,970
all the sticks with a spy's stamp
belong to Team Spy.

2071
01:11:06,510 --> 01:11:09,550
The sticks without a spy's stamp
belong to the respective team.

2072
01:11:09,990 --> 01:11:11,810
I checked earlier.

2073
01:11:11,810 --> 01:11:12,990
I'd rather be a spy.

2074
01:11:12,990 --> 01:11:14,010
They were all stamped.

2075
01:11:14,120 --> 01:11:16,420
This was Running Man Class Race
with seniors and juniors.

2076
01:11:16,420 --> 01:11:18,460
The team with the most number
of prize sticks is...

2077
01:11:18,460 --> 01:11:20,960
(This was a competition among
the three teams and Team Spy.)

2078
01:11:20,960 --> 01:11:23,870
(Out of the four teams,
which team has the most sticks?)

2079
01:11:23,870 --> 01:11:25,890
Team Spy with 88 sticks.

2080
01:11:25,890 --> 01:11:26,960
(Team Spy wins with 88 sticks.)

2081
01:11:26,960 --> 01:11:28,300
They stamped everything.

2082
01:11:28,300 --> 01:11:29,760
Yes, everything was stamped.

2083
01:11:29,760 --> 01:11:32,670
- We only have to find two.
- We can catch them.

2084
01:11:32,780 --> 01:11:34,130
We'll catch them.

2085
01:11:34,130 --> 01:11:35,600
Please write down...

2086
01:11:35,800 --> 01:11:38,750
three names of people
who you think are spies.

2087
01:11:39,100 --> 01:11:41,450
We'll count them and the three most
voted will stand on the platform.

2088
01:11:41,510 --> 01:11:42,920
We have to vote.

2089
01:11:43,250 --> 01:11:47,090
Let's recommend suspicious people
from each team.

2090
01:11:47,090 --> 01:11:48,880
- Okay.
- We have to write three names.

2091
01:11:48,880 --> 01:11:49,990
We know our own teams the best.

2092
01:11:49,990 --> 01:11:53,090
Sure. We'll deduce first.

2093
01:11:53,090 --> 01:11:55,000
I think it's Sae Ho.

2094
01:11:55,000 --> 01:11:59,220
I watched quietly for five minutes
without looking for the cone hat.

2095
01:11:59,370 --> 01:12:02,240
I watched to see
if anybody was stamping,

2096
01:12:03,040 --> 01:12:05,840
and he came along casually.

2097
01:12:05,840 --> 01:12:07,170
He approached the table
like the culprit...

2098
01:12:07,240 --> 01:12:09,100
and looked at Sa Yeon's sticks.

2099
01:12:09,340 --> 01:12:10,910
He reached for his back pocket.

2100
01:12:10,910 --> 01:12:12,920
I made a sound, and he got startled.

2101
01:12:12,920 --> 01:12:14,340
We got it.

2102
01:12:14,340 --> 01:12:15,550
- What was I supposed to say?
- Why did you do that?

2103
01:12:15,550 --> 01:12:17,380
- Old chap.
- Hey, old chap.

2104
01:12:17,380 --> 01:12:19,960
Why did you reach for
your back pocket?

2105
01:12:19,960 --> 01:12:21,620
- Old chap.
- Let's listen to him.

2106
01:12:21,620 --> 01:12:23,250
- Listen to Sae Ho.
- I'm telling the truth.

2107
01:12:23,250 --> 01:12:25,030
- My gosh.
- Sae Ho.

2108
01:12:25,030 --> 01:12:26,700
Do this motion. Show us.

2109
01:12:26,700 --> 01:12:28,500
- Let's see.
- I did this.

2110
01:12:28,500 --> 01:12:29,560
That was it.

2111
01:12:30,090 --> 01:12:31,530
- Let's see.
- I did this.

2112
01:12:31,530 --> 01:12:33,000
(That's obviously
the gesture of the culprit.)

2113
01:12:33,000 --> 01:12:35,430
- That's what...
- That looked so natural.

2114
01:12:35,430 --> 01:12:36,760
I caught him.

2115
01:12:36,760 --> 01:12:37,800
I rest my case.

2116
01:12:37,870 --> 01:12:38,930
It might be true.

2117
01:12:39,130 --> 01:12:41,170
- At that moment...
- You're bad.

2118
01:12:41,170 --> 01:12:43,050
Suk Jin.

2119
01:12:43,210 --> 01:12:44,250
(Screaming)

2120
01:12:44,250 --> 01:12:45,470
It's not me!

2121
01:12:46,470 --> 01:12:48,140
- Come on.
- Suk Jin.

2122
01:12:48,140 --> 01:12:49,450
- It's not me.
- Congratulations, Sae Ho.

2123
01:12:49,450 --> 01:12:50,920
- You had a huge role today.
- That's it.

2124
01:12:50,920 --> 01:12:52,120
We're finished.

2125
01:12:52,120 --> 01:12:54,180
- We're done.
- That's it.

2126
01:12:54,180 --> 01:12:56,920
- That's all for us.
- Thank you.

2127
01:12:56,920 --> 01:12:57,960
Team Singer is next.

2128
01:12:57,960 --> 01:12:59,590
We think...

2129
01:13:00,000 --> 01:13:02,870
it's either Haha
or if there's a huge twist,

2130
01:13:02,870 --> 01:13:05,200
- it could be Sa Yeon.
- It's not Sa Yeon.

2131
01:13:05,200 --> 01:13:06,240
Okay.

2132
01:13:06,240 --> 01:13:07,430
Let me say this.

2133
01:13:07,430 --> 01:13:10,260
These two went around together,
so they have an alibi.

2134
01:13:10,260 --> 01:13:12,040
- Right.
- But it's not me.

2135
01:13:12,040 --> 01:13:14,080
If Sa Yeon denies that it's her...

2136
01:13:14,080 --> 01:13:15,710
Is Haha usually that calm?

2137
01:13:16,000 --> 01:13:17,780
If he's a spy, he should be
screaming like him.

2138
01:13:17,780 --> 01:13:20,010
- It's not me.
- He should be screaming like him.

2139
01:13:20,010 --> 01:13:22,450
- I'm not a spy.
- Old chap, stop it.

2140
01:13:22,450 --> 01:13:24,450
Who's the spy? Say it.
Who's the spy on their team?

2141
01:13:24,450 --> 01:13:26,310
- Jae Suk.
- Hold on.

2142
01:13:26,310 --> 01:13:28,290
We'll ask him who it is.

2143
01:13:28,590 --> 01:13:29,880
- Say it.
- Who is it?

2144
01:13:30,420 --> 01:13:32,180
Who is the spy on this team?

2145
01:13:32,180 --> 01:13:35,200
I'm not a spy, so I don't know!

2146
01:13:35,200 --> 01:13:36,560
Who is the spy on this team?

2147
01:13:36,560 --> 01:13:38,330
- Who is it?
- This is driving me crazy.

2148
01:13:38,460 --> 01:13:39,760
- Fine.
- The person in charge...

2149
01:13:39,760 --> 01:13:41,240
Fine. Stop it.

2150
01:13:41,240 --> 01:13:43,430
Go on the platform, and we'll know.

2151
01:13:43,840 --> 01:13:46,970
If you consider
one tangible evidence,

2152
01:13:47,300 --> 01:13:49,380
Jong Kook danced in the back.

2153
01:13:49,380 --> 01:13:52,380
- I recommend him because...
- Over that?

2154
01:13:52,380 --> 01:13:54,670
- Because...
- She asked me.

2155
01:13:54,670 --> 01:13:56,010
Don't do anything.

2156
01:13:56,010 --> 01:13:58,120
- You're doing that again.
- Don't do anything.

2157
01:13:58,120 --> 01:13:59,450
Stop it!

2158
01:13:59,450 --> 01:14:01,620
He's the spy!

2159
01:14:02,210 --> 01:14:04,130
- I'm telling you!
- I'm going to splash water on you.

2160
01:14:04,460 --> 01:14:05,850
I'll splash this on you
so that you come to your senses.

2161
01:14:05,850 --> 01:14:07,830
(Goodness!)

2162
01:14:07,830 --> 01:14:09,330
I'll write your name
so that you get more attention.

2163
01:14:09,330 --> 01:14:10,800
That's enough.

2164
01:14:10,800 --> 01:14:12,720
- Why would you write my name?
- Stop it.

2165
01:14:12,720 --> 01:14:14,040
(Jae Suk can't hide his smile.)

2166
01:14:14,040 --> 01:14:15,870
It might be Jae Suk.

2167
01:14:15,870 --> 01:14:17,240
It might be him.

2168
01:14:17,240 --> 01:14:19,840
Sae Ho is too enraged,
so I don't think it's him.

2169
01:14:19,840 --> 01:14:21,600
Sae Ho is too frustrated.

2170
01:14:21,600 --> 01:14:22,780
It's not me.

2171
01:14:22,780 --> 01:14:24,170
Let's listen to Team Actor.

2172
01:14:24,170 --> 01:14:26,970
We think it's Rowoon.

2173
01:14:27,210 --> 01:14:29,450
- You two talked.
- We picked him out...

2174
01:14:29,450 --> 01:14:30,750
- What's the reason?
- from the beginning.

2175
01:14:30,750 --> 01:14:33,590
Because of what happened
when we were the offensive team,

2176
01:14:33,590 --> 01:14:35,380
we were suspicious of him.
That's what I said.

2177
01:14:35,380 --> 01:14:37,460
I said it was Rowoon
from the beginning.

2178
01:14:38,660 --> 01:14:40,750
It's because you only look at him.

2179
01:14:40,750 --> 01:14:42,460
- No, Ji Hyo. That's not true.
- It is.

2180
01:14:42,460 --> 01:14:44,170
- It's so true.
- Let's vote now.

2181
01:14:44,170 --> 01:14:45,760
- No, but...
- I wasn't even funny.

2182
01:14:45,760 --> 01:14:46,800
- No.
- We thought it was him too.

2183
01:14:46,800 --> 01:14:48,430
I don't think it's Rowoon.

2184
01:14:48,430 --> 01:14:50,370
Each person will write down
three names.

2185
01:14:50,370 --> 01:14:51,560
- 3 names?
- 1 per team. Yes.

2186
01:14:51,560 --> 01:14:53,540
Let's go with our gut feeling.

2187
01:14:53,540 --> 01:14:54,630
Our gut feeling.

2188
01:14:54,630 --> 01:14:55,880
(If they don't catch 2 of 3 spies,
the spies win.)

2189
01:14:55,880 --> 01:14:57,000
I'm done.

2190
01:14:57,000 --> 01:14:58,140
I'm not sure.

2191
01:14:58,880 --> 01:15:00,310
(Which 3 will get the most votes
and stand on the platform?)

2192
01:15:00,310 --> 01:15:02,210
- I don't know.
- Me neither. This is a headache.

2193
01:15:02,210 --> 01:15:04,140
It's not easy to guess all three.

2194
01:15:04,140 --> 01:15:05,490
This is not easy.

2195
01:15:05,810 --> 01:15:07,180
- Everybody.
- Yes.

2196
01:15:07,180 --> 01:15:09,160
- We have the final result.
- Okay.

2197
01:15:09,160 --> 01:15:11,750
The first person with
the most number of votes was...

2198
01:15:11,880 --> 01:15:12,920
(Most voted on Team Actor)

2199
01:15:12,920 --> 01:15:14,800
Rowoon. Please come on up.

2200
01:15:14,800 --> 01:15:15,850
Rowoon.

2201
01:15:16,560 --> 01:15:17,630
We had no choice.

2202
01:15:17,630 --> 01:15:19,370
- We know this is unfair.
- Exactly.

2203
01:15:20,460 --> 01:15:23,000
On Team Singer, it was Haha.

2204
01:15:23,000 --> 01:15:24,060
Me?

2205
01:15:24,060 --> 01:15:25,170
(Most voted on Team Singer was
Haha with 7 votes.)

2206
01:15:26,380 --> 01:15:28,410
I can't do anything
because of Jin Young.

2207
01:15:28,410 --> 01:15:29,540
(Jong Kook and Jin Young were
together the whole time.)

2208
01:15:29,540 --> 01:15:30,580
That's true.

2209
01:15:30,580 --> 01:15:32,140
It's Dong Hoon then.

2210
01:15:32,140 --> 01:15:34,640
(Haha went around by himself.
Is he the spy on Team Singer?)

2211
01:15:35,380 --> 01:15:37,250
(Haha had 7 votes,
and Jong Kook had 5.)

2212
01:15:37,250 --> 01:15:38,590
On Team Comedian,

2213
01:15:38,590 --> 01:15:39,960
it was Jae Suk.

2214
01:15:40,850 --> 01:15:42,490
- Jae Suk?
- This is insane.

2215
01:15:42,590 --> 01:15:44,330
Why didn't you pick Sae Ho?

2216
01:15:44,330 --> 01:15:46,300
- You're right.
- It's Sae Ho.

2217
01:15:46,300 --> 01:15:47,460
You people!

2218
01:15:47,720 --> 01:15:49,550
Why didn't you pick Sae Ho?

2219
01:15:49,550 --> 01:15:50,890
- Didn't you write Sae Ho's name?
- Why didn't you pick him?

2220
01:15:50,890 --> 01:15:53,040
- You didn't pick Sae Ho?
- Didn't you write Sae Ho's name?

2221
01:15:53,040 --> 01:15:54,930
I saw with my own eyes.

2222
01:15:54,930 --> 01:15:56,910
- Why didn't you write his name?
- Why didn't you pick him?

2223
01:15:56,910 --> 01:15:58,960
- I wrote him down.
- It's not me, Se Chan.

2224
01:15:59,300 --> 01:16:01,100
Why didn't you write his name down?

2225
01:16:01,100 --> 01:16:03,450
Sae Ho, did you write
your own name or not?

2226
01:16:03,640 --> 01:16:05,550
Why would I write my own name?
It's not me.

2227
01:16:05,550 --> 01:16:06,840
That's true. My bad.

2228
01:16:06,840 --> 01:16:08,580
Why is it me all of a sudden?

2229
01:16:08,580 --> 01:16:09,990
- Hey.
- My gosh.

2230
01:16:09,990 --> 01:16:13,460
If there are 2 or more spies
from these 3,

2231
01:16:13,460 --> 01:16:16,830
Team Spy loses, and the next team
with most sticks wins.

2232
01:16:16,830 --> 01:16:18,550
I thought Jae Suk didn't do
anything today.

2233
01:16:18,550 --> 01:16:20,160
I did nothing.

2234
01:16:20,160 --> 01:16:22,660
First, Suk Jin,
please remove Rowoon's name tag.

2235
01:16:22,660 --> 01:16:24,460
- Okay. Is it on the name tag?
- Yes.

2236
01:16:24,460 --> 01:16:27,370
- 1.
- All right. 1, 2, 3.

2237
01:16:29,630 --> 01:16:31,760
(Rowoon was not a spy.)

2238
01:16:31,910 --> 01:16:33,470
- He's not?
- Oh, dear.

2239
01:16:33,600 --> 01:16:36,080
I can't do it. I can't lie.

2240
01:16:36,080 --> 01:16:38,170
- Wait.
- I'm really bad at lying.

2241
01:16:38,970 --> 01:16:41,010
- It's Kwang Soo then.
- It's not me.

2242
01:16:41,010 --> 01:16:42,950
- I swear it's not me.
- It's not Rowoon?

2243
01:16:43,290 --> 01:16:44,880
I swear it's not me.

2244
01:16:45,340 --> 01:16:46,790
Let's go with Haha next.

2245
01:16:46,790 --> 01:16:48,090
- Let's reveal both together.
- It's Ji Hyo.

2246
01:16:48,090 --> 01:16:49,490
- Together.
- Together.

2247
01:16:49,490 --> 01:16:52,030
- 1, 2, 3.
- 1, 2, 3.

2248
01:16:52,030 --> 01:16:53,660
(Jae Suk's already resigned himself
but Haha will decide the winner.)

2249
01:16:54,130 --> 01:16:57,700
(If Haha is not a spy,
Jae Suk's Team Spy wins.)

2250
01:16:57,700 --> 01:16:58,890
- 2, 3.
- 2, 3.

2251
01:16:59,760 --> 01:17:02,200
(Haha was not a spy.)

2252
01:17:02,200 --> 01:17:03,300
- He's a spy.
- Hey!

2253
01:17:03,300 --> 01:17:05,210
See? It's not me.

2254
01:17:05,210 --> 01:17:07,840
(Team Spy wins.)

2255
01:17:09,780 --> 01:17:10,880
- What's this?
- He's a spy.

2256
01:17:10,880 --> 01:17:12,140
(I told you it wasn't me!)

2257
01:17:12,410 --> 01:17:13,580
You...

2258
01:17:13,580 --> 01:17:16,490
- Come here! I told you it's not me!
- Hold on. Sae Ho.

2259
01:17:16,490 --> 01:17:18,210
- I told you!
- Sae Ho.

2260
01:17:18,210 --> 01:17:19,680
It's Jong Kook!

2261
01:17:19,850 --> 01:17:21,250
It's Jong Kook!

2262
01:17:21,250 --> 01:17:23,380
I said it was Jong Kook.

2263
01:17:23,380 --> 01:17:24,530
It's not him.

2264
01:17:24,530 --> 01:17:26,050
(Sae Ho finally proves
his innocence.)

2265
01:17:26,050 --> 01:17:28,700
You failed to catch the spies,
so Team Spy wins.

2266
01:17:28,700 --> 01:17:29,720
All right!

2267
01:17:29,890 --> 01:17:32,460
I'll reveal the identities
of the other two winners.

2268
01:17:32,460 --> 01:17:33,630
- Who are they?
- Okay.

2269
01:17:33,630 --> 01:17:34,840
- Today's spies were...
- It's Jong Kook.

2270
01:17:34,840 --> 01:17:35,960
- It's Jong Kook.
- It's Jong Kook.

2271
01:17:36,460 --> 01:17:37,560
Jae Suk,

2272
01:17:39,060 --> 01:17:40,170
Jong Kook, and Do Hyun.

2273
01:17:40,170 --> 01:17:43,000
(Do Hyun and Jong Kook
were spies as well.)

2274
01:17:43,500 --> 01:17:45,910
(This is where Jong Kook was
most suspected.)

2275
01:17:45,910 --> 01:17:47,550
(He danced with elaborate steps...)

2276
01:17:47,550 --> 01:17:49,420
(and sealed the spy's stamp.)

2277
01:17:49,810 --> 01:17:52,210
(When he was talking to Jin Young,)

2278
01:17:52,710 --> 01:17:55,960
(he stamped without her knowing.)

2279
01:17:56,990 --> 01:17:59,460
(Do Hyun framed Rowoon as the spy.)

2280
01:17:59,800 --> 01:18:02,390
(He followed Rowoon around
and was bold about stamping.)

2281
01:18:03,060 --> 01:18:04,130
Spy.

2282
01:18:04,130 --> 01:18:06,460
(I was the spy.)

2283
01:18:07,390 --> 01:18:08,460
Jong Kook and Do Hyun.

2284
01:18:08,460 --> 01:18:10,000
(Team Spy wins.)

2285
01:18:10,300 --> 01:18:12,260
- Me? Was it me?
- Come here.

2286
01:18:12,260 --> 01:18:14,580
I said it was Do Hyun.

2287
01:18:14,580 --> 01:18:17,340
- You should have argued.
- I told you.

2288
01:18:17,340 --> 01:18:19,140
- Why didn't you argue?
- I did.

2289
01:18:19,140 --> 01:18:21,780
I told you
he was dancing in the back!

2290
01:18:21,780 --> 01:18:23,310
- You did.
- Okay.

2291
01:18:24,290 --> 01:18:27,310
I was dancing and stamping.

2292
01:18:27,310 --> 01:18:28,880
Okay.

2293
01:18:28,880 --> 01:18:31,160
(Jae Suk, Jong Kook, and Do Hyun
get to pick the prizes.)

2294
01:18:31,250 --> 01:18:33,300
Team Spy obtained 88 sticks,

2295
01:18:33,300 --> 01:18:35,630
so each person can pick 3
to a total of 9.

2296
01:18:35,630 --> 01:18:38,460
Today's my last chance,
so I have to win something.

2297
01:18:38,460 --> 01:18:40,560
- The Almighty gave you nothing.
- They gave me nothing.

2298
01:18:40,560 --> 01:18:41,870
They didn't give you this.

2299
01:18:41,890 --> 01:18:43,240
Do Hyun, arrange the cards.

2300
01:18:43,240 --> 01:18:44,260
(Do Hyun will move the cards.)

2301
01:18:44,260 --> 01:18:45,800
I usually get the 40s.

2302
01:18:45,800 --> 01:18:46,880
- In the 40s?
- Yes.

2303
01:18:46,880 --> 01:18:48,800
I'll move the tablet computer
to the 40s.

2304
01:18:49,170 --> 01:18:50,410
- Number seven.
- I'll go with this.

2305
01:18:50,410 --> 01:18:51,470
- Let's go.
- Let's do this!

2306
01:18:51,470 --> 01:18:53,050
Starting with Do Hyun, pick three.

2307
01:18:53,050 --> 01:18:54,420
- Go in order.
- This is the last time.

2308
01:18:54,420 --> 01:18:56,010
Everything's up for grabs.

2309
01:18:56,010 --> 01:18:57,180
- Is this the last time?
- Yes.

2310
01:18:57,950 --> 01:18:59,250
Please take the massage chair.

2311
01:18:59,250 --> 01:19:00,250
(He picked 3.)

2312
01:19:00,250 --> 01:19:01,420
I'll give you a good one.

2313
01:19:01,550 --> 01:19:02,590
What is it?

2314
01:19:02,790 --> 01:19:04,630
Wait.

2315
01:19:04,630 --> 01:19:05,850
- What is it?
- You have to show us.

2316
01:19:05,850 --> 01:19:07,550
(What did he get?)

2317
01:19:07,660 --> 01:19:09,220
What are you doing by yourself?

2318
01:19:09,750 --> 01:19:10,920
- Why, Do Hyun?
- Number 11.

2319
01:19:10,920 --> 01:19:11,920
What is it?

2320
01:19:12,420 --> 01:19:13,740
- Premium wet wipes.
- Premium wet wipes.

2321
01:19:13,740 --> 01:19:15,460
It has premium on it.

2322
01:19:15,460 --> 01:19:16,870
- Okay. And then?
- And then?

2323
01:19:17,260 --> 01:19:18,410
Number 21.

2324
01:19:18,870 --> 01:19:20,340
- Dud.
- Dud. And then?

2325
01:19:21,410 --> 01:19:23,000
- Is it number 1?
- Number 48.

2326
01:19:23,550 --> 01:19:24,800
A bar of gold.

2327
01:19:24,800 --> 01:19:26,410
(Number 48 is a bar of gold!)

2328
01:19:26,780 --> 01:19:29,050
You took a really good one.
That's amazing.

2329
01:19:29,050 --> 01:19:30,250
Thank you.

2330
01:19:30,490 --> 01:19:31,750
Thank you.

2331
01:19:31,750 --> 01:19:32,950
Take it.

2332
01:19:32,950 --> 01:19:34,250
I'll go next.

2333
01:19:34,250 --> 01:19:36,660
- Thank you.
- I'm rooting for you.

2334
01:19:37,550 --> 01:19:39,180
It's a dud.

2335
01:19:39,960 --> 01:19:41,000
Is it a dud?

2336
01:19:41,460 --> 01:19:42,460
Is it a dud?

2337
01:19:42,890 --> 01:19:44,090
- What is it?
- What number is it?

2338
01:19:44,370 --> 01:19:45,960
- What is it?
- A gift card.

2339
01:19:45,960 --> 01:19:47,930
(Jong Kook's number 33 is
a 10-dollar gift card!)

2340
01:19:47,930 --> 01:19:49,260
Gift card.

2341
01:19:49,260 --> 01:19:51,130
- That's amazing.
- Is it 10 dollars?

2342
01:19:51,130 --> 01:19:54,340
- That's better than nothing.
- It's better than nothing.

2343
01:19:54,340 --> 01:19:56,170
I have a good feeling.

2344
01:19:56,170 --> 01:19:57,800
- I'm going to do really well.
- It's going to be big, right?

2345
01:19:57,800 --> 01:19:59,210
It's going to be big today.

2346
01:19:59,210 --> 01:20:01,080
- This is your last chance.
- Right.

2347
01:20:01,080 --> 01:20:02,880
I'll go right away.

2348
01:20:03,120 --> 01:20:04,490
- What is it?
- Number 24.

2349
01:20:04,490 --> 01:20:05,590
(Jae Suk's 1st number is 24!)

2350
01:20:05,590 --> 01:20:06,710
Massage from Jong Kook.

2351
01:20:07,250 --> 01:20:09,850
(Massage from Jong Kook!)

2352
01:20:09,850 --> 01:20:11,090
Yes.

2353
01:20:11,920 --> 01:20:13,250
You're incredible.

2354
01:20:13,250 --> 01:20:16,460
- How incredible. I'm sick of this.
- You're truly incredible.

2355
01:20:17,060 --> 01:20:19,530
- This is something big.
- This is so strange.

2356
01:20:19,670 --> 01:20:21,260
- I have two left.
- My gosh.

2357
01:20:21,260 --> 01:20:22,960
- Number 3 or 30.
- I have 2 left.

2358
01:20:22,960 --> 01:20:24,840
I have number eight.

2359
01:20:24,840 --> 01:20:26,340
- Number eight?
- Oh, dear.

2360
01:20:26,880 --> 01:20:28,600
I'm speechless.

2361
01:20:28,600 --> 01:20:30,580
This is a big deal.

2362
01:20:30,580 --> 01:20:31,950
Give me some energy!

2363
01:20:31,950 --> 01:20:36,590
- Jae Suk! Jae Suk!
- Jae Suk! Jae Suk!

2364
01:20:36,590 --> 01:20:37,680
Last one.

2365
01:20:38,140 --> 01:20:39,620
I think this is good.

2366
01:20:39,620 --> 01:20:41,460
- This one.
- It's good. It's two digits.

2367
01:20:41,460 --> 01:20:43,590
Number 42.

2368
01:20:44,030 --> 01:20:45,920
(Can he avoid his unlucky fate?)

2369
01:20:46,030 --> 01:20:48,550
(Suk Jin's face cushion!)

2370
01:20:48,550 --> 01:20:49,590
There you go!

2371
01:20:49,590 --> 01:20:51,330
(This is the class
of the unlucky one.)

2372
01:20:51,630 --> 01:20:53,670
Use this as a pillow.

2373
01:20:53,670 --> 01:20:55,500
- It's a pillow.
- You can get the massage now.

2374
01:20:55,500 --> 01:20:56,930
Lie down. Put this under your head.

2375
01:20:57,460 --> 01:20:58,800
Put it under your head.

2376
01:20:58,800 --> 01:21:01,210
- Put it under your head.
- You actually picked it.

2377
01:21:01,210 --> 01:21:03,250
- Here.
- This is the worst outcome.

2378
01:21:03,250 --> 01:21:05,410
- Lie down. Here.
- My gosh.

2379
01:21:05,410 --> 01:21:07,550
- Massage.
- This is absolutely the worst.

2380
01:21:08,620 --> 01:21:10,950
- Nothing can be worse than this.
- I know.

2381
01:21:10,950 --> 01:21:12,490
- Let's just get it over with.
- Okay.

2382
01:21:12,490 --> 01:21:13,990
(It's the perfect scene
for the grand finale.)

2383
01:21:13,990 --> 01:21:15,310
Darn it.

2384
01:21:15,590 --> 01:21:16,630
A little more.

2385
01:21:16,630 --> 01:21:18,050
Go ahead and hug the cushion.

2386
01:21:19,490 --> 01:21:21,330
That's enough.

2387
01:21:21,330 --> 01:21:23,160
Okay.

2388
01:21:23,160 --> 01:21:26,370
You got the life-sized Lee Kwang Soo
figure and Ji Suk Jin cushion.

2389
01:21:27,130 --> 01:21:29,060
You guys never leave me alone.

2390
01:21:30,340 --> 01:21:32,500
(The members are at a campground
to celebrate the 500th episode.)

2396
01:21:43,080 --> 01:21:44,250
(However...)

2397
01:21:44,250 --> 01:21:46,750
(They create shocking scenes
with paint all over their body.)

2398
01:21:47,050 --> 01:21:48,590
(Even Harlequin is here.)

2399
01:21:49,380 --> 01:21:50,590
(However...)

2400
01:21:50,590 --> 01:21:51,880
(While their eyes are covered,)

2401
01:21:51,880 --> 01:21:53,590
(they are dragged away somewhere.)

2402
01:21:54,390 --> 01:21:55,530
(There's the protagonist
of the camping...)

2403
01:21:55,530 --> 01:21:58,000
(who tries to eliminate everyone.)

2404
01:21:58,460 --> 01:22:00,370

who terrorized the campground?)

Did you eat before running around?)
